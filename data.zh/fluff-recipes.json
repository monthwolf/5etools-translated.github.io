And few dishes stood out more than Beluir's famous poached salmon. Available at virtually any eating house in town, the most traditional preparation came from the Friendly Burrow tavern, which created a mouthwatering spread, comprising both fresh and smoked salmon, herbs, cream cheese, and a touch of cayenne, served atop a baguette with a sprinkle of capers. If you couldn't get into the Friendly Burrow (it was always packed), the Cold Duck Inn made a worthy representation, and they even had rooms for rent that could accommodate \"tall folk\" guests who needed a rest after all that dining. While Luiren is no more, this famous dish can still be found on board various halfling-crewed spelljammers who commandeered this dish as their own."

Brackleberry Jam is as common as butter in the forest-heavy country of Cormyr, where its topography and climate yield an abundance of seasonal berries so plentiful they colorfully adorn the region's roads and trails.

Senior cook Jarandur Tallstand adapted the traditional wood-elven forest salad, or chopforest, as it has been called, to complement the heavier menu options with its mix of peppered leaves, olives, fennel, and tangy vinaigrette dressing. It is said that a chopforest delivered unto your table, compliments of Yawning Portal proprietor and Undermountain gatekeeper {@creature Durnan|WDH}, is a happy omen before one's descent to Undermountain."

They get their name from their shape; as they bake, puffing into luxurious, golden-brown coverings, which look like warm winter cloaks. While some taverns pan-sear Cloaks in oil to give them a crispy, crunchy exterior, most establishments bake them and the dish is often thought to be best right out of the oven, soft and piping hot inside. On a cold day, a few Cloaks will warm you right up. In Kalaman they squeeze a bit of lemon juice on top to give it a little zing, and in springtime, it's not unusual to find a few edible flowers draped over them. Cloaks make a perfect side for fish or poultry, but eat enough of them, and you may end up skipping the main course entirely."

But while Eldeen Banquet is considered a regional delicacy, interpretations of the crispy, yet spongy, eggplant patty are common in esteemed eateries throughout the city of Sharn. High-end restaurants such as the Azure Gateway and the Celestial Vista, in the Skyway district, offer plates of Eldeen Banquet as delightful as their views.

				"This soy-based protein dish originated from a gnome recipe, but it is equally popular with those who shy away from animal meat, including some communities of elves. It is also ideal in environments where livestock is harder to keep, such as the Underdark and the Rock of Bral. The original gnome version uses chicken broth as a base, but vegetable broths work just as well. While the tofu is the star, the mélange of scallions, bok choy, bell pepper, and carrots imparts a variety of textures and flavors. Rice-based cooking wine and soy sauce make it a lustrous and savory meal."

A base of stone-ground cornmeal, dark rye flour, and a dash of unsweetened cocoa bolster the dark colors and texture. Buttermilk, molasses, and dark brown sugar round out this versatile bread with an almost honeyed nuance, which dips nicely in surplus gravy. You aren't doing it right unless a sizable slab of salted yak butter or the like is slathered on top to melt into its deep, dark nooks. A fancier version, usually served as a meal in itself, has currants or dried fruits rolled in, providing an even chewier and heartier experience. Blackbread is often sold in loaves by the bunch, but they are equally delectable in a portable muffin form, as they are served at the Green Dragon Inn in the Free City of Greyhawk. Blackbread's versatility makes it a great day starter reheated in a skillet, with—you guessed it—additional butter glistening atop. A notable version of this exists in loaf form in Saltmarsh and its nautical outskirts. In truth, whether eaten from a loaf or as a muffin, it's a classic and frugal dark bread that finds its way into many a larder."

While the Netherese, now known as the shadowstuff-infused Shadovar, have changed much over the centuries, this spectacular dish hasn't. These allium-based pancakes are an inexpensive and unexpectedly filling treat that pairs easily with savory roast meats. They're also delicious served solo, when dolloped with fresh cream and pureed fig spread for a uniquely Netherese experience. In many regions, scallions are an equally acceptable base vegetable that offers a pancake with a milder flavor. Regardless of how one chooses to consume this pan-fried appetizer, the culinary experience is one of the few good reasons to come to the Shadowfell."

				"Kaeth, or coffee, is an aromatic brew made from ground roasted beans and is famous for its invigorating properties, making it a prevalent day starter throughout the worlds of the multiverse. In Sigil, the City of Doors, planar sightseers can sample from a wide array of coffee beans and beverages from countless planets. Kaeth, as it is commonly called on the planet Toril, has developed into quite the delicacy along the Sword Coast, where it is now imported in droves. In the nation of Sembia, a popular method of preparation features a blend of melted chocolate and liquor. In some areas, kaeth is so popular that it has become more profitable than the tea trade. The peoples of the planet Krynn drink tarbean tea and kefre, both of which are derived from vibrant, dark-roasted beans and frequently served black. In contrast, citizens of the Outer Planes imbibe numerous spiced and creamed variants of kaeth, including the notable Mountain Majesty of Mount Celestia. On the planet Oerth, coffee trends more acidic and is frequently blended into creamy liquors to grant an extra kick. But perhaps the most notable, kav'la, in which creamed coconut milk is swirled into a malted, dark, nutty roast, is served in tall, ornate ceramic vessels and is easily found in the cultured bazaars of Sigil. Regardless of which varietal you choose, kaeth, in its endless forms, serves as a caffeine-infused pick-me-up, whether on the trail or in the safe confines of one's homestead."

However, in its earlier incarnations, raston pastry dated back to the first Dragon War, when not even scraps of stale bread could be discarded. Crusts of stale bread were habitually tossed into a basin and later mashed to create livestock feed, but the kender saw an opportunity. Stale bread was separated from other half-finished morsels; soaked in water; sugared, spiced, and dried; then served up as what was known as kender loaf, the pre-owned bread. So popular was kender loaf that the process was refined with eggs, cream, and spices, evolving into the bread puddings we know today."

An early tale held that kender stumblenoodles were born of a collision between two frantic kender cooks—when their pots mixed, it resulted in an unexpected alliance of flavors and ingredients. However, ask a kender adventurer, and you may as likely hear a yarn concerning a well-placed insult aimed toward a draconian corporal and his squad. As the bold kender scoundrel made haste to flee, he frantically threw about any valuables behind him to dissuade his pursuers. In his desperation, he ejected a small sack of mixed spices, hardened cheese, a jar of mustard, and several handfuls of uncooked spiral pasta shells that, as kender luck would have it, served as a meal of caltrops for draconian toes and sent the kender's pursuers stumbling into the mud. In honor of this brave kender's sacrifice (the loss of a perfectly good sack of pasta), kender across Krynn have memorialized the occasion in classic, good-humored kender fashion."

The flavor of this effervescent blend of peaches, dark berries, vanilla, cloves, and liquor (for the brave, a sizable enough dash to make your toes tingle) is as fascinating as the diminutive folk who invented it. Kender—said to be birthed of magic and chaos—approach food in much the same manner as they traverse the worlds of the multiverse: adventurously. The buttery, flaky topping oozing with soft, chopped peaches should be enough, but when combined with blueberries, the cobbler filling brightens in a curiously kender way. This dessert is especially popular on Mid-year Day in Sixthmonth, which also happens to be Peach Month in Ansalon, but it remains the dessert of choice for the kender of Krynn regardless of holiday or season. Often served as a cobbler, sometimes as a crumble, but never to be skipped, especially when offered warm with a hefty dollop of fresh whipped cream."

Priced at only three copper pieces per pint at most local taverns and other Domains of Dread, this table wine is known to be spectacularly unremarkable. However, in some areas of the Shadowfell, clever mixologists have added copious amounts of ice and lime juice to the pungent grape-ish mix, turning this otherwise mediocre concoction into a refreshing, slushy treat worth at least four copper pieces anywhere."

				"在克莱恩的世界里，在古代弑君者战争之后不久，王子基斯-卡南向他的兄弟西塔斯国王呼吁获得西部的主权。他的哥哥和平地授予西部精灵从希尔瓦内斯蒂国家独立出来。然而，西部精灵的新国王基斯-卡南却遭遇了数十年的散居生活带来的艰难困苦。在他们的首都奎里诺斯特建立之前，他的精灵族人一直在努力寻找新的生活方式，靠土地生存。几种简单而简陋的饭菜进入了精灵族的饮食食谱，包括 \"丰收奖\"，一种精心准备的烘烤蔬菜砂锅。茄子、西葫芦、黄瓜和西红柿等可获得的农产品被切成薄片，然后在新鲜的罗勒和西红柿（压成酱）上叠成扇形，然后在烤之前淋上新鲜和芳香的油。这道简陋而丰富的菜肴可以用很少的成本养活整个精灵村。虽然克莱恩的精灵们现在一年四季都在准备这道菜的变体，并通过灵感的替换来驾驭季节，但下面的组合是最经典的，也是最值得推荐的。"

Easy to prepare on the road for large parties, it has also become a popular dish in the military for its simplicity and heartiness to help soldiers brave the endless grey days. Named after an orc henchman of Lord Robilar, who inventively cooked this sausage meal for his adventuring party, using his shield for a skillet, Quij's Plate would eventually earn its place on the menu of the famed Green Dragon Inn, nestled in the Free City of Greyhawk's bustling River Quarter. The unusual name has since become the catch-all term for the countless iterations of this sausage-and-potato-based campfire classic, including those that migrated to misty Barovia via lost and hungry adventurers."

Distilling cherry stems, skins, and even pits into the liqueur activates an almost nutty layer of flavor that hits right after the initial sugary wave passes. The Blade and Stars, a tried-and-true establishment in the port city of Baldur's Gate, offers a remarkable interpretation of this offshore staple using a traditional ruby port instead of fermented Moonshae cherry juices. Even better, the Blade serves food and drink right in the guest rooms, ensuring that no one will notice just how many of these wondrous cocktails are consumed."

Traditional elven sornstag is slow smoldered with ground coriander, cumin, and hotspice or curry in a thick broth and is a popular plate among wood elves during the Highharvestide Festival. Humans have also adopted their own stewed preparation techniques for this gamey, yet succulent, main course. Throughout the wooded regions of Faerûn, stags are hunted by humans for both sport and meal, resulting in the proliferation of venison-based cuisine. In the bucolic forests and fields of the Dalelands, the most popular regional recipe for sornstag demands a full day's preparation. The traditional recipe calls for powdered almonds simmered with red wine to form the emulsified base of a piquant sauce, in which the meat soaks overnight before it is slow-cooked on an open flame from dawn for an early evening feast. But to get it to the table faster, you can skip the overnight marinade and cook it in an oven for just a few hours. Notably, the Silver Taproom, in Essembra, sees travelers from far and wide eager to sample its famous pied sornstag, which consists of a heaping ladle of this venison stew baked inside a buttery crust. You'll know the sornstag pies are ready when the scent of the aromatic pastry wafts down bustling Rauthauvyr's Road."

It even contains a freshwater lake (Lake Bral), frequently refilled by water harvested from ice asteroids, and, yes, livestock in the form of swine. Spiced Pork and Orange Peppers was a favorite of the famed Captain Bral and has remained a signature dish on the menu of the Laughing Beholder, run by gregarious beholder Large Luigi, and other notably unsavory eateries that dot the avenues of this lawless asteroid outpost.

Although countless variations exist, talyth commonly comprises meats (typically sliced sausage), cheese, spices, and herbs nestled between two large crackers, all lightly baked to adhere the layers. While the baking process seals in flavor, it also ensures its portability, making talyth a common travel snack along the major Faerûnian trade routes. Although frozen talyth can easily be reheated on an open campfire, freshly made talyth affords a more eclectic and adventurous array of savory ingredients, including diced egg, oysters, snails, and even spiced worms."

In a popular iteration of this dish, detailed in the culinary notes of Tika Waylan, former barmaid at the inn, \"pulled turkey breast is substituted for the shrimp and enlivened with a dash of dry white wine.\" The sauce itself is so flavorful, it can perk up even the most mundane meats, something resourceful locals were forced to do post-Cataclysm, which left the Tarsis seaport landlocked. Regardless of your protein of choice, this is a not-to-be-missed regional delicacy."

Today, you can sample these crispy treats throughout the Rock of Bral. Some street chefs fry them in a skillet, though connoisseurs insist the open flame yields the best texture.

Even when civilization along the Sword Coast advanced, the pre-Netherese tradition of serving food on edible plates remained. No longer used for pure utility, trencher bread is traditionally prepared hard, flat, and dry, but it is lightly salted and seasoned to make the \"second course\" more appealing. It has also taken on other shapes, notably a bowl, which has become a popular vessel for serving soups and stews. The bread is served along the crowded, cobbled lanes of major metropolises as far south as Calimport and as distant as the Rock of Bral asteroid spaceport. Look for street vendors in Middle City's Great Market serving rare mammalian meats and sauces on this bread—a quick and cheap option for on-the-move off-worlders—and embrace the novelty of an ancient taste of Toril."
