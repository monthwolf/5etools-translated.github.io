Adjust the heat to medium-low and continue cooking for 15 minutes, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally and adjusting the heat as necessary to make sure the onions are cooking gently, not scorching. Add the thyme, ginger, and flour and continue to cook, stirring, until the onions are sticky and golden, about 5 minutes more. Add the cider, broth, and ½ teaspoon salt.

				"Transfer the beef to a cutting board and, using a large slotted spoon, spoon the onions and pears onto a serving platter; tent loosely with foil to keep warm. Pour the accumulated liquid into a measuring cup and let rest until all the fat rises to the surface, about 10 minutes. Tilt the measuring cup and use a wide, shallow soup spoon to skim the fat off the surface and discard it. Add the vinegar and most of the parsley to the defatted liquid and stir to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary.",
				"Remove the twine from the beef and cut it against the grain into ½-inch-thick slices (or pull it apart into pieces). Place the meat on the platter with the onions and pears, pour the seasoned juices over the meat, sprinkle with the remaining parsley, and serve."

				"Put the flour in a wide, shallow dish, such as a pie plate. In another wide, shallow dish, beat the eggs with the water. Set both dishes aside.",
				"On a work surface, using a sharp knife, cut each chicken breast in half horizontally to make eight cutlets. Cover them with plastic wrap and use a meat pounder or the bottom of a small skillet to pound the thicker ends so the cutlets have an even thickness of ¼ to ½ inch. Remove the plastic, sprinkle the cutlets evenly with the salt-pepper mixture, and set aside to rest for 10 minutes.",
				"Meanwhile, in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, combine the neutral oil and olive oil and warm until shimmering.",
				"Dredge two cutlets in the flour on both sides and shake off the excess. Dip in the beaten egg mixture, allowing the excess to drip into the dish. Gently add the cutlets to the oil and cook until golden brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes (there should be active, but not violent, bubbling at the edges of the cutlets). Carefully flip them and cook until the second side is golden brown, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer the cutlets to the prepared wire rack, and put in the oven to keep warm. Repeat to cook the remaining cutlets, adjusting the heat if necessary to avoid burning (do not discard the remaining flour).",
				"Discard the oil in the skillet, then carefully wipe it out with paper towels. Set the skillet over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of the butter, and let melt, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan. Add the shallot, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the vermouth, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a strong simmer. Cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen and dissolve the caramelized bits, until the vermouth is reduced by almost half, about 2½ minutes. Add the chicken broth, lemon slices, and any juices accumulated from the rested cutlets. Return the mixture to a strong simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until again reduced by about almost half, about 3 minutes longer.",
				"Meanwhile, cut the remaining 2 tablespoons butter into small cubes, add to the flour, and toss to coat. Remove the skillet from the heat, add the coated butter and ¼ teaspoon salt, season with pepper, and whisk to melt and incorporate the butter. Add the parsley and whisk to incorporate. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Arrange the cutlets on a serving platter and spoon the sauce and lemon slices over them before serving."

On the sugared paper, unfold the puff pastry (which should be rectangular) and, if it is less than 15 inches long, place a second parchment sheet over it and use a rolling pin to gently roll it to that length (taking care not to press too hard, which compresses the layers, decreasing their puff when baked). Remove the top parchment sheet. If necessary, using your fingers, gently loosen the long edge of the pastry nearest you from the bottom piece of parchment paper (this will make it easier to begin rolling it with the filling). Evenly spread the room-temperature butter over the pastry and sprinkle the larger quantity of the sugar mixture over the butter, all the way to the edges. Lay a piece of parchment paper over the sugar mixture, gently press down to help the mixture adhere, and remove the parchment.",

Remove the buns from the oven and, working quickly, brush with the melted butter and sprinkle each with about ½ teaspoon of the reserved sugar mixture.

			"noteCook": [
				"The dimensions of puff pastry sheets vary by brand, so depending on which one you use, you may or may not have to roll it to the required length. Regardless, make sure your pastry is completely thawed, so you can unfold it initially, and roll it up with the filling, without it cracking. It should still be cool, though, because warm puff pastry can become sticky. Finally, don't allow the baked buns to cool completely in the muffin tin, or they will stick to the cups.",
				"All that said, don't allow all this information daunt you. The buns are, in fact, easy to form and bake, and easier yet to eat. On that note, they're best within a couple of hours of baking. You can, however, re-crisp them with about a 5-minute stay in a 350°F oven."

Tilt the skillet to coat the entire cooking surface with oil, carefully place the dough circle in the skillet, and cook, undisturbed, until spotty brown on the bottom and slightly puffed, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the bread over and continue to cook, undisturbed, until the second side is spotty brown as well, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer the bread to a baking sheet or ovenproof plate and place it in the oven to stay warm. Working with one dough ball and 1½ teaspoons oil at a time, repeat to roll, cook, and keep the remaining rounds warm.

Transfer the mixture to one of the prepared baking sheets, spreading it into a thin, even layer (set the bowl aside).",
				"Roast the vegetables on either rack until tender, 25 to 30 minutes, stirring and turning the vegetables two or three times. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, add the chopped thyme, and stir to incorporate it. Spread out the mixture and allow to cool to room temperature for about 20 minutes. Leave the oven on for more baking.",
				"Return the cooled vegetables to the now-empty bowl. Stir in the soy sauce, dill, ¾ teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Adjust the seasoning, if necessary, and set aside until needed.",
				"Replace the parchment paper on the baking sheet or wash the nonstick liner and return it to the baking sheet. Have a small bowl of water handy.",
				"Dust a large sheet of parchment paper with flour. If you are working with homemade pie pastry, divide the dough into two balls. Working with one ball of homemade pastry, or one sheet of store-bought pastry, roll the dough into a 12-inch circle. Sprinkle half of the whole thyme leaves evenly over the pastry, cover with another sheet of parchment paper, and roll lightly to help the thyme stick. Flip the pastry over so the thyme leaves are on the bottom, and set aside. Repeat with the remaining pastry and remaining whole thyme leaves.",
				"With a 4-inch round biscuit or cookie cutter, cut six circles out of each pastry round, patching together scraps if necessary, for a total of twelve circles. Working with six of the pastry circles, place about 1½ tablespoons of the vegetable mixture in the center of each round, leaving a ½-inch border around the edge. Working with one piece of pastry at a time, moisten the edge of the pastry circle and fold the pastry over the filling to make a half-moon shape. Press out any trapped air, press the edges firmly to seal, and, using a fork, crimp the edges for decoration and to secure the seal. Repeat with the remaining pastry rounds and filling, and transfer onto the prepared baking sheets.",
				"In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush the top and sides of each marruth with the mixture. Bake until the marruths are light golden brown and crisp, about 25 minutes, rotating the sheets 180 degrees and switching racks halfway through the baking. Set the baking sheets on wire racks, cool the pastries for about 5 minutes, and serve hot."

Add the figs, lemon zest, cinnamon, anise, salt, and brandy to the food processor and process until very finely chopped and well blended, about 20 seconds, stopping to scrape down the sides as necessary. Add the ground almonds and pulse several times to incorporate them, about four 2-second pulses. Scrape the mixture into the medium bowl. Place the sesame seeds in a wide, shallow bowl.",

Press gently with your fingers to flatten and shape the balls into ovals about 3 inches long, 2 inches wide, and ½ inch thick. Working with one oval at a time, place it in the sesame seeds, pressing gently to help the seeds adhere to the bottom. Place the cakes, sesame-side up, on a plate. Let rest to firm up and dry out slightly, for 1 hour before serving."

In another small bowl, mix together the ginger, garlic, red pepper flakes, and 2 teaspoons of the peanut oil; set aside.",
				"In a very large (14-inch) nonstick skillet over high heat, warm 2 teaspoons peanut oil until shimmering. Add half the chicken in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until the pieces brown on the bottom but are not quite cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a large bowl and set aside. Add another 2 teaspoons peanut oil to the skillet over high heat and warm until the oil is shimmering. Add the remaining chicken, cook as before, and transfer to the bowl when finished.",
				"Add another 2 teaspoons peanut oil to the skillet over high heat and warm until the oil is shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pieces begin to soften and brown at the edges, 2 to 3 minutes; add it to the bowl with the chicken. Add another 2 teaspoons peanut oil to the skillet over high heat and warm until the oil is shimmering. Add the bell pepper and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are barely tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium, clear the center of the pan, add the remaining 2 teaspoons peanut oil, and allow it to warm until shimmering. Add the ginger-garlic mixture and cook, stirring and mashing it, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Whisk the soy sauce mixture to recombine, add it to the skillet, and cook, stirring and scraping the skillet constantly, until thickened, about 1 minute.",
				"Add the chicken mixture, noodles, all of the scallion whites, and most of the scallion greens to the skillet and toss to combine. Cook, stirring constantly, until the noodles are heated through and coated with sauce, about 2 minutes.",
				"Transfer the mixture to a serving platter, sprinkle with the remaining scallion greens, and serve."

			"noteCook": [
				"A large skillet is important to provide maximum cooking surface for food to spread out. If it is all heaped together, the food will steam instead of achieving the desired browning effect.",
				"Shrimp can be substituted for the chicken. When doing so, buy extra-large (21 to 25 shrimp per pound), and be sure not to overcook them. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes initially, and add them to the vegetable and noodle mixture about halfway through the final heating time, after about 1 minute, so they are only in the mixture until just cooked and heated through, about 1 minute."

Set aside to cool to room temperature. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, if necessary.",
				"MAKE THE TEMPURA. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels and set aside. Clip a deep-fry or candy thermometer to the side of a heavy 5-quart Dutch oven, add the oil, and warm over medium-high heat to 390°F. Preheat the oven to 200°F. Place a wire rack on a second large, rimmed baking sheet and set aside.",
				"Meanwhile, fill a large bowl about one-third full with ice and about 1½ cups water. In a medium (preferably stainless-steel) bowl that will fit in the larger bowl, whisk together the cake and all-purpose flours and ¾ teaspoon salt; set this bowl in the bowl with the ice water to chill the flour mixture. When the oil reaches 390°F, add the sparkling water to the flour mixture and stir just until the wet and dry are incorporated, but still a little lumpy; do not overmix.",
				"Working with about eight pieces at a time, use tongs or chopsticks to dip them in the batter to coat thoroughly. Allow any excess batter to drip off, then slip them into the oil and fry until slightly puffed and pale gold, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain 390°F, stirring to prevent sticking, and turning the pieces over in the oil once or twice to promote even frying, 5 to 6 minutes for each batch. With a spider skimmer, slotted spoon, or long tongs, transfer the tempura to the paper towel–lined baking sheet to drain for about 30 seconds. Sprinkle lightly with salt and place on the wire rack set on the baking sheet and put in the oven to keep warm. Allow the oil to recover to 390°F and fry the remaining batches. Serve with the sweet and sour sauce."

Turn the beef a quarter turn and continue cooking, until well browned on each of the remaining three sides, about 10 minutes more; adjust the heat if the bottom of the pot threatens to burn. Transfer the beef to a large bowl.",
				"Return the pot to medium-high heat, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and allow it to warm until shimmering. Add the onion, bay leaves, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally, until the onion begins to soften and releases some liquid, about 4 minutes. Add the paprika and flour and continue to cook, stirring, for 2 minutes more. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more.",
				"Add the wine to the pot and stir and scrape the bottom to loosen and dissolve the browned bits. Add the broth, finely chopped apricots, garlic, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt and stir.",
				"Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 300°F with a rack in the lower-middle of the oven.",
				"Nestle the beef (and any accumulated juices) into the pot (the liquid should come about halfway up the sides of the meat). Cover the pot, transfer it to the oven, and cook for 1¾ hours. Then add the carrots, potatoes, and halved apricots, nestling them into the liquid. Cover the pot, return to the oven, and continue to cook until the beef is extremely tender (a paring knife should slip easily into the meat) and it registers 200°F on an instant-read thermometer, 2¼ to 2¾ hours more.",
				"Transfer the beef to a cutting board and, using a large slotted spoon, spoon the carrots, potatoes, onion, and apricot halves to a serving platter; tent loosely with foil to keep warm. Pour the accumulated liquid into a fat separator or measuring cup; remove and discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Reserve the garlic. Let the liquid rest until the fat rises to the surface, about 10 minutes. If using a fat separator, pour the liquid into another container; if using a measuring cup, tilt it and use a wide, shallow soup spoon to skim fat off the surface and discard it (the liquid will be thick, and there may not be much fat at the surface.)",
				"Meanwhile, squeeze the cooked garlic cloves from their skins and mash them to a paste with a fork. Stir the garlic and most of the parsley into the defatted liquid. Taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary.",
				"Remove the twine from the beef and cut it against the grain into ½-inch-thick slices (or pull it apart into pieces) and sprinkle it very lightly with salt and pepper. Place the meat on the platter with the vegetables and apricots, pour the gravy over the meat, sprinkle with the remaining parsley, and serve.",

For the last batch, combine the remaining roughly chopped cucumber, remaining leeks, and remaining 1 cup chicken broth in the blender; add the half-and-half; and puree. Add to the bowl, stir in the lemon juice and ¾ teaspoon salt, and season with pepper. Stir in the diced cucumber. Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 4 hours.",

Cover the pan with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and set aside until the buns appear puffy and their volume has increased by about three-fourths or doubled, about 1 hour.",
				"When ready to bake, with a rack in the lowest position, preheat the oven to 375°F. In a small bowl, beat the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water. Gently brush the tops of the buns with the egg wash (take care not to deflate the dough) and bake until deep golden brown, 20 to 24 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Set the pan on a cooling rack and cool for about 15 minutes. Gently loosen the edges of the buns with your fingers and gently pry them out of the pan. Cool the buns until just warm or room temperature, remove the parchment from the bottom of the buns if necessary, and serve. Leftover buns can be wrapped tightly and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days."

Place the pork on the prepared roasting rack, fat cap-side up, and pour the water into the pan, making sure it does not touch the bottom of the pork. Roast until the pork is very tender (a paring knife should slip in and out of the meat very easily) and the meat near the bone (but not touching it) registers 190°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 hours, checking once or twice on the water level in the roasting pan. If there is less than ¾ cup, add more. Transfer the pork to a platter or carving board, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 30 minutes. Pour the liquid from the roasting pan into a fat separator or a narrow, heatproof container, and allow it to settle for 10 minutes. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the fat for the sauce and discard the rest.",
