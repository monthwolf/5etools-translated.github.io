After wandering for days, Citlali saw an elegantly dressed skeletal figure trailing behind her, never moving too close or straying too far. She tried to flee, but the figure always caught up. When she turned and followed her pursuer instead, the skeleton led Citlali to a hidden cenote. Citlali dove in to assuage her thirst, and when she resurfaced, the skeletal figure was gone.",
								"Observing that the area was rich in precious minerals, Citlali returned home and convinced others to join her to settle the valley north of the cenote and the mountains now known as Citlali's Rest. Citlali grew old, and the skeletal figure returned to take her, but the settlement remained. It was named in her honor, with Citlán roughly translating to \"the place near Citlali.\" People began calling the skeletal figure La Catrina for her elegant clothing.",
								"San Citlán's history is rife with conflict. After years of failed invasions over its first century of existence, the city was overcome and occupied by a colonizing force. Colonial rule lasted for two hundred years and ended in a bloody series of conflicts called the Wars of Separation. In the aftermath, the folk of San Citlán held their first elections, finally looking forward to a time of peace. The wars have left scars, turning previously fertile lands barren and driving away the fey that once inhabited the region—some say forever."

The common people cherished her, but the attitude of others was not so kind.",

Eventually, political tensions turned the folk hero into a figure of infamy. Meanwhile, {@creature Young-Gi|JttRC} publicly gave Queen Young-Soo credit for all of Won-Ha's achievements, ensuring that the queen's legend would never fade, while Won-Ha was forgotten.

There's currently little evidence of Kirina and Kedjou's involvement in the Goldwarren's collapse, but Kirina carries with him a copy of the runes the high priest uses in experimental summoning rituals. Prior to the scorpion attack in Anisa, Kirina painted the runes from this paper in a nearby alley, preparing it for the priest's magic. In the course of the expedition into the Goldwarren, if Kirina falls {@condition prone}, is rendered {@condition unconscious}, or at another opportune time, this paper slips from his clothes. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check notices the dropped paper before Kirina does. Alternatively, a character who sees Kirina drop the paper and recover it can steal the page from Kirina with a successful DC 14 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check.",
										"If asked about the paper, Kirina is dismissive, claiming to have found it on the street. This copy of the runes might become useful evidence of Kirina's wrongdoing during the {@area adventure's conclusion|234|x}."

								"The ancestors of the people of Shankhabhumi migrated here from other lands about a thousand years ago. They arrived to find swamp forests infested with monsters and other dangers—a land shaped by hundreds of riverines who were indifferent to the newcomers and their fates. Then the elven leader Kubjhatika killed a giant mollusk that attacked her people. After the battle, she carved the tale of her victory and her people's journey on a beautiful, red-ridged shell. This shell became the Riverine's Shankha. Kubjhatika offered it as tribute to the riverines, appealing to them for refuge amid the unforgiving land.",
								"The four greatest riverines—Adirohit, Iravati, Mehul, and Joltara—each wished to claim the Riverine's Shankha as their own. Kubjhatika proposed the Shankha Trials to ensure it would circulate fairly. But since people who could barely survive in this unstable land couldn't put on such a spectacular event, Kubjhatika persuaded the riverines to each create a site for a great city. Thus, the riverines created the stable islands on which Manivarsha, Sagorpur, Ashwadhatu, and Tippurika would be built, and the histories of those great cities began."

Most Djaynaians wear a form of shawl or cloak at all times, and their fashion favors muted colors. Headwear is typically worn in public, most commonly cowls with pointed caps, wide-brimmed hats, or tagelmusts and tasuwarts that can function as headgear and veil. Clothing in Janya parallels Djaynaian style but features materials like eel skin and elegantly woven sea grasses."

Indeed, Djaynai has ultimately prevailed over all invaders, with a key role played by the mystical practices known as the Blackmist Way and Blackthrone Arts. Unfortunately, Djaynai's friendly neighboring realms are more often threatened. For instance, inscrutable lizardfolk in the wetlands periodically congregate and cause havoc in the nearby ocean. The Lightsea Lancers—who take their name from the shallow coastal waters Djaynaians call the Lightsea—was formed to monitor such threats before they impact Djaynai. Travelers occasionally come to Djaynai to learn the Lightsea Lancers' ways, as their heroics, dance-like martial arts, and knowledge of transmutation magic are renowned throughout Djaynai and beyond.",
								"Beneath the Nightsea, the realm of Janya has its own tales. Many tell of how early Janyans were focused not only on rebuilding their lives but on preserving what they treasured from the land above. To keep such lore safe, ancestral Janyans built structures in hidden reaches, like the Trench of Love Lost, to archive sacred wisdom before it was lost. Eventually, though, such archives faded from memory. Profound Djaynaian secrets remain hidden in the deep, awaiting rekindling."

The area in which the city of Yongjing would one day rise was originally populated by nomadic dwarf shepherds. As humans immigrated to the region, conflict between the races broke out. Legends say that the violence persisted for a century, until the Dragon of Heavenly Blessings who had founded Great Xing returned. Descending from the clouds, the great dragon bowed before a young dwarf leader, bestowing on him the ability to inspire and unify folk of both human and dwarven ancestries. This dwarf became the Yellow Dragon Emperor, founder of the nation's first ruling dynasty.",

One fable, however, tells of the Winter Crane Empress, who was dethroned by a human. As the story goes, three of her advisors came forward with three different plans for war, but the exiled dwarf empress instead called for a sumptuous bed to be made for her. She then took a nap until the usurper died of old age, reclaiming her throne without violence and swiftly undoing the little he could accomplish in his brief human life span."

Cut deep into its island alongside residencies for the shrine's warrior-priests and libraries holding relics from around the world, the shrine is central to Umizu's many celebrations. Each winter, citizens gather for the Thunder Festival and honor the Turtle Sage—the guardian spirit of the islands—with three days of drumming, dancing, and prayer."

Most families live in multigenerational homes, and the wealthiest favor polyamorous marriages, typically with a clan matriarch and several spouses of any gender. Powerful clans compete for prestige through formal dueling matches every few months.",
										"Umizu has few taboos around sexuality and gender. Titles such as \"daimyo\" are gender-neutral, as are most names. Clothing varies by class status rather than gender—instead, people express their gender through perfumes. Bright citrus scents are feminine coded, musky wood tones are gender-neutral, and floral scents are masculine. Umizu has rigid sumptuary laws that reinforce the social hierarchy, restricting colors, fabrics, and styles of dress based on class."

They consult ancestral spirits before making life-changing decisions, but the perspectives of the dead can be just as flawed as those of the living. Disagreements in large family clans sometimes result in battles involving hundreds of ancestor spirits, with tumultuous consequences for their living descendants."
