								"维尔梅隆是在定居者在山坡上发现铂金矿脉后建立的，在大约十年的时间里，原矿和精炼金属的生意都很兴隆。由于崎岖的地形和恶劣的气候，该村从未发展壮大。它断断续续地接待了一拨又一拨的旅行商人，他们来村子里待上一两个星期，出售和交易他们的货物，然后又离开。距离最近的文明居住区有三天的马路，在山腰上。书中提到的居民包括市长雷-杜维津、一位善良而有才华的矮人铁匠托尔蒙和他的妻子布莱尼丝。",
								"70年前，一场爆炸震撼了这个铂金矿，隧道坍塌，工人被埋在数吨的瓦砾之下。那天有60名矿工在地下。其中30多人死于最初的坍塌，而隧道的不稳定性使得对其他人的救援变得缓慢而危险。在坍塌中幸存下来的矿工在获救前被困了数天或数周，或者在深渊中孤独而惊恐地死去。16人活着出来了。11人从未被发现。",
								"在这场灾难之后，另一种恐怖困扰着这个村庄，人们开始失踪，从幸存者开始--然而并不是一下子全部失踪。一个或两个人会在一个晚上消失，然后在下一次失踪之前可能会有一个工作日。这些莫名其妙的失踪让剩下的矿工们感到害怕。在所有幸存者消失或逃离后，其他村民也开始消失。村民们试图通过携带武器睡觉和轮流值班来保护自己，但没有任何改变。成群结队地旅行也无济于事，因为同伴甚至在短暂离开视线时就可能消失。",
								"由于没有人愿意继续开矿，而且失踪事件导致人们担心韦尔梅隆可能被诅咒，商人和其他旅行者不再访问这个村庄。这个拼凑的故事的结尾声称村子还在那里，尽管是否有人居住在那里是个谜。这卷书的作者沉思着村庄的衰落，猜测着居民的命运。他们想知道是否值得雇用冒险家去看看村子里是否还有什么东西，特别是铂金矿。在最后一页的背面画了一张村子位置的粗略地图，以及从最近的山城（叫Maerin）到这里的路线。",

After coming through the portal and being drawn in by the splendor and magic of the bathhouse, he bargained with the hags to restore his youth. But when second thoughts caused him to renounce the bargain, the hags' curse aged him well into his venerable years, and he is now wracked with constant pain.

The soul can be corrupted by the absence of wisdom. One's body can be sullied by violent deeds. The mind is easily compromised by ego and emotional attachment.",

It is also famous for the obsession its citizens have for divining the future; most Tashlutans claim to have some amount of skill with personal prognostication.",

						"Long ago, the wizards of Netheril created a magnificent stone golem to guard one of the {@i Nether Scrolls}—a collection of dangerous scrolls that described the creation of magic and the nature of the Weave. The wizards gave the golem a sapphire heart and magically bound a sliver from the gem to the right palm of its master, Hamukai. They charged the young wizard-prince of the ancient nation of Anauria with guarding the priceless scroll.
