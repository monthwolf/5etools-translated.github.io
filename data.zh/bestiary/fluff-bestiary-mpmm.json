				"在一段时间内，对这种禁忌文本的研究可以瞒过其他illithids，甚至瞒过长老的大脑。然而，最终，决心追求巫术的掠心者必须为了自己的安全逃离殖民地。一旦他们尝到了离开殖民地的自由，有些人就会珍惜自己的隐私，有些人则寻求与类似的思想交流，还有一些人则试图通过提升自己的地位来支配一个殖民地，而这种领导地位通常是由一个长老的大脑来担任的。无论如何，所有这样的奥术师都面临着同样严峻的事实：当他们死亡时，他们不会加入长老大脑中的心智群体--异端心智永远不会被接受为集体的一部分。对他们来说，死亡意味着遗忘。",

						"与真正的巫师法器不同的是，思维陷阱的periapt在被摧毁后并不能使alhoons恢复到不死状态。相反，被摧毁的alhoon的思想会被转移到periapt中，在那里它与任何其他被困住的alhoon思想以及被牺牲者的灵魂保持交流。",
						"心灵诱捕术所赋予的不死之身只持续到所选择的活体受害者的生命。因此，牺牲了一个200岁的精灵的alhoon期待着比牺牲了一个35岁的人更长久的存在。Alhoons可以通过与新的受害者重复这个仪式来延长他们的存在，有效地为自己重新设置时钟。",
						"破坏思维陷阱的periapt会使被困在里面的人被遗忘，因此alhoons经常一起工作，为他们的periapt和他们喜欢的仪式地点创造精心的保护措施。有时，一个alhoon被委托保管思维陷阱的periapt，但这是一个危险的提议。任何持有periapt的人都会在攻击、蓄力和检查中对与之相关的alhoons产生优势，而这些alhoons反过来在攻击、蓄力和检查中对持有者也会产生不利。此外，持有者可以与被困在其中的任何牺牲的灵魂进行心灵感应，periapt中的alhoons也可以与持有者进行心灵感应。携带periapt的生物不能阻止alhoons的交流，但可以让被困的灵魂安静下来。"

				"由于他的成就，贝尔被授予青铜将军的称号。尽管他获得了荣誉，但他在地狱政治的泥潭中艰难跋涉。他的批评者称他为天真，尽管从未当面说过。他的主要兴趣一直是在战斗中领导士兵，所以他发现自己升到更高等级的野心不断受到政治上精明的对手的阻挠，这让他感到沮丧。",
				"贝尔更喜欢让他的对手成为仆人，而被束缚在他手下的凡人则通过成为他高超计谋的牺牲品来获得他们的悲惨地位。贝尔很乐意饶恕那些被他打败的人的生命--如果他们向他保证他们的灵魂和服务。恶魔是个例外；尽管他愿意腐蚀几乎所有其他的敌人，但他总是摧毁被他打败的恶魔。",
				"贝尔也欢迎凡人为他服务，如果他们能在政治上为他提供优势。他招募精明的人，并依靠他们在玛门的法庭上代表他的利益，这样他就可以自由地追求他的战斗欲望。",
				"尽管他对战斗以外的事务缺乏兴趣，或者也许正因为如此，贝尔获得了一小批崇拜者的追随。那些在他的祭坛前膜拜的人称他为 \"地狱之王\"，而最痴心妄想的人认为他是所有魔鬼的主宰。在奥术界，某些著作，如可怕的《火之书》，说贝尔向世界揭示了隐形咒语，尽管一些魔法学者激烈地驳斥了这种说法。贝尔有时被描绘成一只蟾蜍、一只猫、一个人，或这些形式的某种组合。"

				"Dedicated to Lolth, chitines are multiarmed bipeds with arachnid qualities. Most live in colonies in the Underdark and fight the enemies of the Demon Queen of Spiders. Long ago, the cult of Lolth first subjected elf prisoners to horrible rituals that transformed them into creatures with both elven and spider traits, which their creators dubbed chitines. The intention was to create servile warriors dedicated first to the cult and then, only by association with it, to Lolth. The goddess found this arrangement unacceptable.",
				"As punishment, the Spider Queen twisted her worshipers' rituals. The process usually transformed subjects into the spindly creatures her devotees expected, but occasionally, an elf changed into a choldrith: an arachnid Monstrosity able to command and create more chitines on its own. These choldriths soon led the chitines to rebel and abandon their creators, founding free colonies elsewhere in the Underdark. On occasion, though, colonies can be found in remote, gloomy areas of the surface world, warring against Lolth's enemies.",
				"The cult of Lolth still creates chitines as the need arises. Outside the presence of a choldrith, chitines make good workers, and they can be useful if the cult finds an independent chitine colony and want to infiltrate it. If the creation process yields a choldrith, though, the cult destroys the creature.",
				"As servants of Lolth, chitines love spiders. They rear spiders and similar arachnids, such as cave fishers (also in this book). Chitine colonies erect shrines to Lolth that serve as beacons, attracting spiders and other beings that serve her. Anywhere chitines set up a colony quickly becomes a webshrouded, gloomy, and treacherous place.",
				"Chitines resemble spiders, but they behave more like social insects such as ants. They are divided into worker and warrior castes; choldriths, when present, occupy the top levels of a colony's hierarchy. Each chitine has a social position that comes with duties related to that rank, and all are expected to sacrifice themselves to protect the colony's choldriths. Every chitine has spinnerets and slowly produces webbing that is used to build floors, walls, structures, objects, and traps that benefit the colony. A warrior might be responsible for crafting web armor (which is as tough as hide or leather), while a group of workers might be tasked to dig pit traps and cover them with fragile webbing disguised with loose dirt to appear as a solid surface."

				"A choker's usual method for luring prey involves positioning the body of its latest catch just outside its hiding spot. Whenever it gets hungry, it tears off a few chunks of flesh to feed itself. In the meantime, the corpse serves to entice other curious folk—explorers from the surface world, drow, duergar, or the choker's favorite prey, goblins—to come within reach.",
				"When a target presents itself, the choker's starfish-shaped hands dart out of its hiding spot, wrap around the victim's throat, and pin the unfortunate creature against the cavern wall. Because its arms are so long, the choker can keep its body deep inside the crevice where it hides, beyond the reach of most normal weapons.",

As revenge for the devotees' betrayal, the Spider Queen manipulated the creation rituals so that they sometimes created choldriths instead of chitines.",

Instead, they were pleased, because choldriths could lay eggs that birthed more chitines (and the rare choldrith) and could direct the chitines in their work. But the devotees soon realized their mistake—choldriths belonged to Lolth, body and soul. Choldriths whispered to the chitines of their adoration of the Spider Queen and their enmity against their creators, and led them in a successful revolt.",
				"Choldriths are born with a mystical connection to Lolth, which gives them divine magic. They also make up the ruling caste of most chitine colonies. A colony can support numerous choldriths, who serve as commanders, priests, and supervisors. The choldriths continually jockey for position, although they rarely confront one another in a way that puts the colony at risk. The colony is ruled by a sovereign, who determines which colony members perform which tasks, including whether a choldrith is permitted to lay eggs. Sometimes a choldrith ruler receives a vision from Lolth that inspires the entire colony into some grand, often violent, action."

If it's in a superior position and its foe poses no threat, it might toy with its food, drawing out its prey's death. A death kiss prefers to hunt alone. If it meets another of its kind, it might fight, flee, or team up, depending on its health and pride."

The creation prompts the leaders of the house to begin crafting new plans to strike at its rivals when the draegloth is fully grown.

Most draegloths fiercely resent being given orders, but thanks to their training, they typically take out their frustration on their creator's enemies, rather than on their creator.

They bring an emotional intensity to their lives, whether they're exploring neighboring tunnels, defending their homes, engaging with their families, or crafting bold new works. The bonds of friendship and kinship are strong, though navigating the inevitable outbursts of frustration and despair is not always easy. Similarly, duergar tend to be very community-minded—in the Underdark, all must cooperate to survive.",

They tend to favor works that are sturdy and grand, but in a bare, stripped-down fashion that favors geometric forms. The strongholds they design are blocky and stark, and the weapons they forge are blatantly tools of violence. While others may decry their creations as cold and bare of ornamentation to the point of austerity, duergar see them as honoring the materials used and honest about their purpose."

However, if the frost giant doesn't give enough honor to Vaprak or fails to heed Vaprak's visions, injuries the frost giant sustains heal wrong, resulting in discolored skin; warty scars; and vestigial body parts, such as extra digits, limbs, and even heads.

To hasten their pace and teach them to mind her will, the queen sped up their internal clocks and shrank them.

They typically use this innate connection to find their creator and make that creature their first victim, though they might instead seek out their maker to enjoy proximity to a kindred spirit. Although redcaps don't usually operate in groups, an individual responsible for the creation of multiple redcaps at the same site could attract the entire group to serve as cohorts, emulating that individual's murderous handiwork. Some hags and wicked mages know methods to call redcaps out of the Feywild and might likewise put teams of them to work as grisly servants.",

Charming and pleasant, he is a master at negotiation, able to twist words so as to leave his victims confused and believing he's on their side.

Titivilus finds adventurers well suited to the tasks he needs performed and recruits them directly or through intermediaries, expending them later as his plans require."

When the sun sets, the newly hatched young emerge from the lair to eat the captives alive.",

Any hollow or crook will do, but often a special cavity is carved out of the trunk.

After three days, a sprout emerges from the ground at the base of the tree and swiftly grows into a bipedal form.",

A wood woad's face is void and expressionless, except for the motes of light that swim about in its eye sockets. Wood woads speak little, and when not called on to take action, they root themselves in the earth and silently take sustenance from it.",

The site a wood woad guards might lose its power or significance over time, or those whom it was assigned to guard might die. If it is freed from its specific duties, a wood woad might roam to find another place of natural beauty or fey influence to watch over.",
