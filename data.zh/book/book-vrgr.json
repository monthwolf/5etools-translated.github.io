				"在阴影之城的隐秘角落里，有一些噩梦般的领域，它们渴求着勇敢者和无辜者、野心家和邪恶者。有些人把这个阴森恐怖的国度称为 \"迷雾之地\"，但怪物猎人却把它称为 \"雷文洛夫特\"。恐怖、魔法、神秘和悬念充斥着这些支离破碎的领域，这是一个无限的画廊，里面有正在展开的邪恶、古老的阴谋、受诅咒的血统、传奇的怪物和不朽的恶棍。来自无数世界的邪恶之徒将雷文洛夫特视为他们的监狱，著名的人物包括巫妖王阿萨林-雷克斯（Azalin Rex）、不择手段的科学家维克特拉-莫登海姆（Viktra Mordenheim）和邪恶的第一吸血鬼斯特拉赫-冯-扎罗维奇（Strahd von Zarovich）。这些黑暗领主在其孤立的领域内拥有令人难以置信的力量，但他们作为被称为黑暗势力的邪恶力量的受害者，被关押在永恒的折磨中。",
				"拉文洛夫特是一个基本的魔幻王国，它的名字来自于其最臭名昭著的闹鬼地点--位于巴罗维亚的可怕的拉文洛夫特城堡--臭名昭著的斯特拉赫-冯-扎罗维奇。在这个神秘的环境中，土地、时间的流逝、潮汐和其他所有可靠的事实都会发生不可预知的变化。拉文洛夫特（Ravenloft）的土地--也被称为恐惧之域--不是被距离或政治所束缚，而是被雾气所束缚的岛屿，在阴影之城的无边阴暗中漂流。在这些超自然的迷雾中隐藏着无数的领域，而在这些秘密的领域中，最可怕的是那些从你的噩梦中诞生的，并通过你的冒险赋予其严峻的生命。",
				"虽然Ravenloft是一个充满邪恶传说的环境，但该领域并不是没有英雄。勇敢的灵魂，如调查员Ez d'Avenir、猎杀怪物的Weathermay-Foxgrove姐妹，以及学者Rudolph van Richten，都在探索这片领域的秘密。虽然数量不多，但这样的冒险家代表着像灯塔一样照亮黑暗的反抗之光，来自所有土地和世界的角色都可能渴望或被迫挑战潜伏在阴影中的邪恶力量。",
				"拉文洛夫特的迷雾正在上升。你将在恐惧之域中发现什么神秘的东西？你将塑造什么样的噩梦？一旦你进入迷雾，你还能逃脱吗？",

								"在生活中，斯特拉赫特-冯-扎罗维奇伯爵是一个无情的有效征服者。在数十年的残酷军事行动中，他击败了对手，建立了一个国家。从战争中退役后，斯特拉赫特在他取得最大胜利的美丽山谷中定居。在那里，他按照祖先的方式，将自己的鲜血洒向大地，在自己和这片土地之间签订了契约。为了纪念他的父母Barov国王和Ravenovia女王，他将山谷命名为Barovia，并建造了他的堡垒--Ravenloft城堡。",
								"斯特拉特年轻时曾在战争中与乌尔姆斯特宗教裁判所的创始人乌尔姆特并肩作战，但当他步入中年后，便开始寻求家庭的慰藉。他邀请自己的亲属与他一起住在雷文洛夫特城堡，最终他的弟弟谢尔盖也加入其中。",
								"谢尔盖拥有斯特拉赫特所没有的一切--年轻、富于同情心和热情。在他到达巴罗维亚后不久，年轻的冯-扎罗维奇和一位名叫塔季扬娜的当地村民相爱了。斯特拉特对他的兄弟心怀怨恨，在见到塔季扬娜并感受到她的纯真善良后，更是如此。由于迷恋她，斯特拉赫特试图向塔季扬娜求爱，但遭到了她的强烈反对。由于不愿意接受她的愿望，也不愿意接受谢尔盖成为他的好朋友，斯特拉赫特深入研究了他的土地上的险恶秘密，并了解到了琥珀寺。在那里，在隐藏的传说和古代邪恶的遗迹中，斯特拉赫特第一次遇到了黑暗势力，并与他们进行了交易，以恢复他的生命力并俘获塔季扬娜的心。",
								"在谢尔盖和塔季扬娜的婚礼上，斯特拉赫特谋杀了谢尔盖，并喝下了他兄弟的血，以确定他与黑暗势力的契约。他向塔蒂亚娜展示了他的新力量，希望能让她着迷。相反，由于对谢尔盖的谋杀感到恐惧，塔季扬娜逃离了斯特拉赫特，最终从雷文洛夫特城堡的高处跳下，逃离了他，并消失在迷雾中。与此同时，城堡的守卫和婚礼的宾客中的叛徒也起来刺杀斯特拉赫特。尽管受了无数的伤，但斯特拉赫特并没有死。他与黑暗势力的交易性质被揭露，斯特拉赫特成为多元宇宙的第一个吸血鬼。一夜的血腥愤怒之后，当黎明触及雷文洛夫特城堡的护栏时，里面已经没有活人了。但斯特拉赫特仍然存在。",

								"When Tsien Chiang was a child, her home was destroyed by a colonizing force, forcing her to flee into frozen mountains where she expected to die. Fortunately, a gold dragon took pity on her and gave her shelter. With nowhere else to go, Chiang promised to serve the dragon.",
								"During the years that followed, Tsien Chiang attended the dragon, learning mysterious magic and medicine. In time, she became an accomplished wizard. Yet when she spoke of avenging her family and reclaiming her people's land, her dragon mentor chided her for holding onto her hatred and refused to teach her dangerous magic.",
								"Eventually, Chiang could deny her revenge no longer. Among her mentor's records, she had learned of a bell that could make its ringer's dreams come true—but creating the bell required the scale of a gold dragon. Knowing her mentor would never provide a scale, Chiang drugged the dragon with a rare herb, planning to steal a small scale while he slept. But in her haste, she mixed the herbal concoction poorly. The dragon's body and everything nearby rapidly aged and decayed, killing her benefactor and destroying a hoard filled with ages of treasures and wisdom. Chiang's home had been destroyed again, but a single golden scale remained. Using the scale, Chiang constructed the Nightingale Bell and dragged it into her occupied city. Tolling it, she wished for a city devoid of invaders—and instantly they vanished.",
								"Awed and delighted, the nation executed the few invaders lingering outside the city and made Tsien Chiang their queen. Chiang ruled for years, enacting vast reforms and strict but sensible laws in pursuit of creating the perfect empire. She had a family, taking particular pride in her four beloved daughters.",
								"As the memory of Chiang's past victories faded, her people grew frustrated with the queen's stern laws and demanding orders. Though her capital had become a radiant center of learning and art, the citizens revolted. Chiang acted swiftly to quell the uprising with numerous executions, yet the revolution grew. Everything she had wished for fell into flames. She showed no mercy to the rebels, ordering her armies to kill the families of all insurrectionists. In response, assassins struck Tsien Chiang's palace. Although she survived, her family did not.",
								"Distraught, Chiang climbed to the highest tower of her palace, looked out over her burning dreams, and struck the Nightingale Bell. Rather than granting her vengeful wish, the bell cracked and spilled a golden mist across the land. When the mist cleared, Tsien Chiang's perfect city was gone, replaced by the unreal prison-city of I'Cath.",

Ramya Vasavadan was hand-picked by her father to succeed him, but on the bleak day of the maharana's death, Ramya's brother, Arijani, declared himself the new maharana. Allied with ranas hungry for unearned power, Arijani tried to force Ramya to relinquish the Sapphire Throne.",
								"Ramya refused to yield. Moving swiftly, she organized her allies, met her brother in battle, and captured him. She intended to execute Arijani, but her sister Reeva counseled her to be merciful. Ultimately, Ramya forgave the rebel faction, Arijani was imprisoned, and Ramya ascended as Kalakeri's maharani, Queen of Kings.",
								"A golden period in Kalakeri's history followed as Ramya promoted learning and upheld justice. Meanwhile, Reeva secretly coordinated with Ramya's foes. After years of resentment and plotting, the rebels freed Arijani and spurred nobles across the nation into open revolt.",
								"The resulting conflict swiftly turned vicious. Regretting her past mercy, Ramya captured enemy ranas and executed them using flame and ravenous tigers, while her loyalists put anyone suspected of treason to the sword. The maharani's brutality increased distrust in her rule, and the fighting spread.",
								"After numerous battles, Reeva begged her sister to meet her brother and negotiate an end to the war. Ramya, who remained ignorant of Reeva's part in freeing Arijani, trusted her sister—and walked straight into their trap.",
								"Ambushers slaughtered Ramya's royal guards and captured the maharani. In the central courtyard of the Cerulean Citadel, Arijani sentenced his sister to death. As the court strangler's garrote crushed her windpipe, Ramya cursed her brother and sister, calling them bloodthirsty beasts. Arijani and Reeva denied their sister the honors befitting a maharani, dumping Ramya's corpse into the sea. As they did, a terrible monsoon struck the Harvest Peninsula, bringing with it walls of supernatural mist that closed around Kalakeri.",
								"The storm lashed Kalakeri for weeks, and when it reached its height, Ramya emerged from her watery grave. Reborn with terrifying power, she called upon those who had been slaughtered in her service. Loyal in death, a corpse legion joined the revitalized maharani. They stalked the streets of Jadurai, tore down the gates of the Cerulean Citadel, and slaughtered those who had betrayed Ramya. They dragged Arijani and Reeva into the courtyard where their sister died, and there Ramya declared them traitors. The treacherous pair clawed and howled like beasts as undead elephants crushed them to death. Their wails of terror left Ramya unmoved.",
								"Arijani and Reeva's plots didn't end with their lives, however. They too were reborn, transformed into fiends with animalistic features by their souls' ravenous desires.

								"Harkon Lukas's life companions are ambition and blood. Born amid a community of lycanthropes, he dreamed of commanding not just a pack, but a whole army, a nation, even an empire of born predators. Early in life, he sought to unite his reckless werebeast family and turn them into tools of his ambition. When they failed him, though, Harkon lashed out, ultimately driving the lycanthropes to turn on him. The would-be leader murdered dozens but barely escaped alive, fleeing into a nation of humans.",
								"In the years that followed, Harkon learned how to blend in with other peoples, how to manipulate those he considered his inferiors, and how to turn adoration into a weapon. He decided that if rule over a nation of hunters wasn't possible, he would force an empire of sheep to dance to the howling of wolves. Harkon Lukas became a legend, a performer, a teacher, a scoundrel, and a luminary. People flocked to bask in his remarkable presence.",
								"Eventually, though, the land's rulers realized the threat Harkon posed. Officials tried to quietly imprison him for invented crimes, but the people defended him. When royal agents came for him en masse, the lycanthrope feigned his death. Outraged, the celebrity's followers rioted, and as the news spread, their outrage inspired a revolution. Within a week, the nation's government had crumbled, its defenders fleeing before an army that bore the red-stained coffin of Harkon Lukas at its head. As the rebel forces neared the walls of the royal palace, they were met by a contrite monarch, who gave a heartfelt speech, begging forgiveness and outlining concessions and a way for the nation to move forward. The rebels agreed to further negotiation.",
								"At that moment, Harkon Lukas ended his ploy, bursting from his crimson coffin in wolf form and devouring the monarch before thousands of followers. Drenched in blood, the \"resurrected\" Harkon returned to his human form and donned a battered crown amid the roaring cheers of a nation of fans. But before the reign of the wolf could begin, the Mists rose amid the assembled throng and closed around their champion. When they cleared, the sovereign-wolf was no longer a step away from rule, but a stranger in an unfamiliar provincial land called Kartakass.",

On those days, people move freely through the open gates, and the silent, heavily armored guards of the Casques Silencieux watch over calm promenades and markets. But a day or a week or a month later, the first telltale cough cracks amid the crowd. As people evacuate the streets and lock their doors, rats crawl from the sewers in tremendous numbers. Shortly thereafter, the gates slam shut. No doctors come, and no information arrives; the populace is left to die.",

Inevitably, frustration and fear beget superstition and violence.",

As wealth trickled into the merchants' coffers, those of low birth began to taste the benefits of nobility.",

The burgeoning middle class sapped her family's authority, transforming them from lords over the commoners into mere landlords. But Renier's family surrendered to the times. Her grandfather grew infirm over the years and less able to look out for the family's interests, and the others—even her twin sister, Louise—seemed oblivious to the threat. It fell to Jacqueline to correct their failings.",

Expending a fortune, Renier aggressively pursued membership. Finally she was granted an invitation to join the society's members at their meeting place hidden among the sewers of Pont-a-Museau. But when Renier arrived, she found a throng of filthy commoners, not the dramatic masterminds she'd expected. As she cursed them and set off to fetch the guards, the council members revealed their true {@creature wererat} forms. That night, she was inducted into their ranks.",

Her first major act consisted of conferring the gift of lycanthropy upon her family. Only her twin, Louise, resisted, for which Jacqueline disfigured her and cast her out.",
								"Next, she bent her wererat allies to her vicious pursuit of control, unifying the country's verminous hordes. Within the sewers of Pont-a-Museau, the wererats concocted a roiling pestilence incubated in the filth of the bourgeoisie. Disease was not unknown in Richemulot, but the virulence of this new Gnawing Plague sent panic through the populace. The disease killed indiscriminately, wiping out the nation's royal dynasty and leaving power vacuums filled and then quickly emptied by ailing nobles. Only the Reniers proved immune, and eventually Jacqueline stood as the highest-born noble in the land, and the nation's de facto leader.",

								"Valachan forces adventurers to survive in a wilderness that's not merely hostile, but is actively trying to destroy them. Other terrors in the Domains of Dread take the form of vicious villains or terrifying monsters. But in Valachan, the land is the greatest threat, and the domain's murderous Darklord hones that threat like a weapon.",
								"The Trial of Hearts anchors the terror in Valachan, but the domain's dangerous wilderness threatens anyone who explores the land. In addition to natural rain-forest predators, dinosaurs and {@creature Displacer Beast||displacer beasts} roam the domain. Its varied Plant creatures include wicked {@creature Twig Blight||twig blights}, cruel {@creature Treant||treants}, and manipulative {@creature Dryad||dryads} all expressing the land's underlying blood thirst. The people of the land—the werepanthers of Oselo, the Shuaran, and remote groups of lizardfolk—might provide assistance to outsiders, but they don't tolerate those who insult their ways or bring Chakuna's wrath upon them. Parties without experience exploring dangerous wilds can enlist a guide to aid them, a service that the Oselo are particularly willing to provide.",
								"Valachan provides the opportunity to exaggerate everything the players and characters know about the threats of nature. The {@skill Survival} skill proves invaluable in navigating the rain forest, determining what kind of creature mauled a corpse, and understanding how different venoms afflict a jungle survivor. The primal power of the land manifests as environmental hazards such as sudden storms, cliff walls made of vertical quicksand, and naturally occurring pit and snare traps. Whispering hollows, carnivorous plants, and cursing winds can overtly reveal the wilderness's hunger.",

As scared innocents packed Metrol's last lightning rail, known as Cyre 1313, the evacuation was delayed at the demand of a late-arriving VIP. Hundreds were forced from passenger carriages to admit and maintain the secrecy of this last passenger and their retinue. When the lightning rail did finally depart, it was too late.

When the druids discovered the youth's hunger for blood, they cast him out, but Tristen grew enraged and slaughtered the druids, draining them all.

Tristen died with his adopted family, but as the Mists closed in around their sacred stone circle, he rose a ghost. Unexpectedly, with the dawn, Tristen's dhampir body was restored. Now, Tristen lives by day, a perpetually young, charming, invention-obsessed dhampir dwelling in Castle Tristenoira, the smoking fortress his goblin servants built over the druid circle of his one-time family.

Spirits, angels, fiends, and worse answer her summons, but as long as they chart Malocchio's path to glory, Gabrielle eagerly accepts their gifts."

								"Only the group's highest-ranking members know that the Keepers of the Feather began in Barovia as a small sect of {@creature Wereraven|VRGR|wereravens} (see {@book chapter 5|VRGR|5}) dedicated to opposing the evils of Strahd von Zarovich. Though their numbers were not enough to oppose the Darklord directly, they sought useful lore and aided brave souls from the shadows, manipulating fortune to confound some of Strahd's more diabolical plots. Over generations, the wereravens' hidden resistance to Strahd continued in Barovia, but some among them learned of other lands suffering beyond the Mists. Unwilling to let the innocents of those lands fend for themselves, some of the Keepers of the Feather ventured forth, hoping to share their wisdom and their subtle resistance to evil with those who needed it most.",
								"However, the Mists find a way to twist even the best of intentions. In the cities of urbane domains like {@book Borca|VRGR|3}, {@book Darkon|VRGR|3}, and {@book Dementlieu|VRGR|3}, the mystical writings and talismans the wereravens carried from {@book Barovia|VRGR|3} came to the attention of the bored elite. Fascinated, these socialites became obsessed with the occult, seeking out esoteric works, hiring doubtful fortune-tellers, and hosting parlor séances. In most cases, the results were passing fads. In some, they were catastrophic—the unprepared successfully summoned fiends and angry spirits into their salons. But a few earnest amateur spiritualists genuinely sought to learn more about the secrets beyond their homes, their lives, and the Mists. In these would-be occultists, the wereravens saw potential.",

But all have a strong interest in séances, fortune-telling, secrets of the afterlife, sightings of mysterious creatures, metaphysical theories, and tales of the macabre.

										"Knowing the threats that Darklords and other evils pose, wereravens of the Keepers typically don't reveal themselves to those not of their kind. Rather, they infiltrate Keeper societies as reclusive members, traveling experts, or foreign scholars. Some Keepers also tell of sightings or visitations involving giant raven-like beings that appear, speak some prophecy or deliver some message, then vanish, often presaging either wonder or disaster. The wereravens take little issue with these exaggerated tales from those who've witnessed their hybrid forms, and they willingly play into the tales of the Keepers if it means spurring them to action.",
										"The Keepers of the Feather are a loose organization, incorporating members who operate alone or in small groups, as well as elite social clubs or secretive societies. In all cases, Keepers identify each other by the Mark of the Raven, a sunburst emblem worn as a pin or amulet. Drawn from esoteric writings, this mark is a recreation of the {@item Holy Symbol of Ravenkind|CoS}, a storied religious artifact from Barovia. Though these reproductions carry no magical properties and most non-wereraven Keepers don't know the symbol's origin, many foul forces instinctively recognize the symbol as an emblem of good."

He can't express himself as fully as he'd like, since he can appear for only a few minutes every day and can't speak. However, he can manipulate ectoplasm to paint colorful, floating symbols and images. When possible, he depicts information and conveys emotions or warnings. Erasmus's art is fleeting, though, vanishing in seconds. Sadly, his father cannot perceive him or any manifestation he creates.",

Aromantic yet deeply affectionate, Erasmus delights in frequenting the rooms of those he cares about, leaving behind colorful greetings. He never pushes others to reveal his presence, though, since attempts to do so only cause Rudolph pain.",

Traits such as a {@creature Troglodyte||troglodyte's} Chameleon Skin or a {@creature Doppelganger||doppelganger's} Ambusher can help make a monster feel more sinister as it lurks in hiding and ambushes its foes. Some traits, such as a {@creature Night Hag||night hag's} Etherealness or an {@creature Imp||imp's} Invisibility, can help a monster escape from an encounter so it can return to haunt the adventurers another day. Traits such as a {@creature Banshee||banshee's} Horrifying Visage or a black dragon's Frightful Presence can heighten the inherent fearsomeness of truly terrifying creatures.",

Considering its origins and appearance, the troll literally being a troll isn't important to you; you're more interested in that general challenge and look for the creature. To make your troll feel notorious, you think of what would scare adventurers—where they're vulnerable and what they're sensitive about. You come up with an idea for a creature that can come from anywhere, maybe even within the adventurers' own gear. With tactics and traits in mind, you think of your troll as an abductor and give it the Grappler trait of a {@creature mimic} and the Amorphous trait of a {@creature black pudding} so it can sneak in anywhere. Finally, you don't think of the troll as a minion, but you give it the Alien Mind trait to reflect its tormented psyche. Then you flesh out its story and give it a name: {@creature the Bagman|VRGR}.",

Over time, the strange forces of this magical in-between place transformed the adventurer into a monstrous creature. Now, every night, {@creature the Bagman|VRGR} slips out from a random {@item bag of holding}. If he doesn't find his home, he drags someone back into the bag with him and leaves behind some trinket from his hidden kingdom of lost junk.

Is {@creature the Bagman|VRGR} just a monster that preys on adventurers, or is he the Darklord of his own hidden domain? The possibilities for horror adventures are endless, and nowhere—especially not adventurers' gear—is safe."
