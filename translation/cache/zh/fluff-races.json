{
	"Sequestered in high mountains atop tall trees, the aarakocra, sometimes called birdfolk, evoke fear and wonder. Many aarakocra aren't even native to the Material Plane. They hail from a world beyond-from the boundless vistas of the Elemental Plane of Air. They are immigrants, refugees, scouts, and explorers, their outposts functioning as footholds in a world both strange and alien.": "隐居在高山高树之上的阿拉科克拉，有时被称为鸟人，唤起人们的恐惧和好奇。许多阿拉科克拉甚至不是物质世界的原住民。他们来自一个更远的世界--来自空气元素界的无尽远景。他们是移民、难民、侦察员和探险家，他们的前哨站在一个既陌生又陌生的世界中起着立足点的作用。",
	"From below, aarakocra look much like large birds. Only when they descend to roost on a branch or walk across the ground does their humanoid appearance reveal itself. Standing upright, aarakocra might reach 5 feet tall, and they have long, narrow legs that taper to sharp talons.": "从下面看，Aarakocra很像大鸟。只有当它们下降到树枝上栖息或走过地面时，它们的人形外观才会显现出来。直立时，阿拉科克拉可能达到5英尺高，它们有长而窄的腿，渐渐变成锋利的爪子。",
	"Feathers cover their bodies. Their plumage typically denotes membership in a tribe. Males are brightly colored, with feathers of red, orange, or yellow. Females have more subdued colors, usually brown or gray. Their heads complete the avian appearance, being something like a parrot or eagle with distinct tribal variations.": "羽毛覆盖他们的身体。它们的羽毛通常代表着一个部落的成员。雄性的羽毛颜色鲜艳，有红色、橙色或黄色的羽毛。雌性的颜色比较低调，通常是棕色或灰色。它们的头完成了禽类的外观，像鹦鹉或鹰一样，有明显的部落变化。",
	"Nowhere are the aarakocra more comfortable than in the sky. They can spend hours in the air, and some go as long as days, locking their wings in place and letting the thermals hold them aloft. In battle, they prove dynamic and acrobatic fliers, moving with remarkable speed and grace, diving to lash opponents with weapons or talons before turning and flying away.": "没有什么地方比在天空中更舒适了。它们可以在空中停留数小时，有些甚至可以停留数天，把翅膀锁在原地，让热气流托着它们飞翔。在战斗中，它们被证明是充满活力的杂技飞行者，以非凡的速度和优雅的姿态移动，在转身飞走之前俯冲到对手身上用武器或爪子猛击对手。",
	"Once airborne, an aarakocra leaves the sky with reluctance. On their native plane, they can fly for days or months, landing only to lay their eggs and feed their young before launching themselves back into the air. Those that make it to a world in the Material Plane find it a strange place. They sometimes forget or ignore vertical distances, and they have nothing but pity for those earthbound people forced to live and toil on the ground.": "一旦飞上天空，Aarakocra就会不情愿地离开天空。在它们的母体上，它们可以飞行数天或数月，只在降落时产卵和喂养幼崽，然后再飞回空中。那些来到物质界的人发现那是一个奇怪的地方。它们有时会忘记或忽略垂直距离，它们对那些被迫在地面上生活和劳作的地球人只有怜悯。",
	"The resemblance of aarakocra to birds isn't limited to physical features. Aarakocra display many of the same mannerisms as ordinary birds. They are fastidious about their plumage, frequently tending their feathers, cleaning and scratching away any tiny passengers they might have picked up. When they deign to descend from the sky, they often do so near pools where they can catch fish and bathe themselves.": "Aarakocra与鸟类的相似之处并不限于身体特征。Aarakocra表现出许多与普通鸟类相同的举止。它们对自己的羽毛非常挑剔，经常打理自己的羽毛，清洗和抓去它们可能捡到的任何小乘客。当它们决定从空中降落时，它们经常在水池附近这样做，在那里它们可以捕鱼和洗澡。",
	"Many aarakocra punctuate their speech with chirps, sounds they use to convey emphasis and to shade meaning, much as a human might through facial expressions and gestures. An aarakocra might become frustrated with people who fail to pick up on the nuances; an aarakocra's threat might be taken as a jest and vice versa.": "许多arakocra用鸣叫声作为他们讲话的标点，他们用这些声音来表达强调和遮掩意思，就像人类通过面部表情和手势来表达一样。对于那些不能理解其中细微差别的人，阿拉科拉人可能会感到沮丧；阿拉科拉人的威胁可能会被认为是一种玩笑，反之亦然。",
	"The idea of ownership baffles most aarakocra. After all, who owns the sky? Even when explained to them, they initially find the notion of ownership mystifying.": "所有权的概念使大多数阿拉科拉人感到困惑。毕竟，谁拥有天空？即使向他们解释，他们最初也觉得所有权的概念很神秘。",
	"As a result, aarakocra who have little interaction with other people might be a nuisance as they drop from the sky to snatch livestock or plunder harvests for fruits and grains. Shiny, glittering objects catch their eyes. They find it hard not to pluck the treasure and bring it back to their settlement to beautify it. An aarakocra who spends years among other races can learn to inhibit these impulses.": "因此，很少与其他人交往的阿拉科克拉可能会成为一个讨厌鬼，因为他们从天而降，抢夺牲畜或掠夺收成的水果和谷物。闪亮、闪光的物体吸引着他们的目光。他们发现很难不去摘取宝物，并将其带回自己的居住地，以美化它。一个在其他种族中生活多年的阿拉科克拉人可以学会抑制这些冲动。",
	"Confinement terrifies the aarakocra. To be grounded, trapped underground, or imprisoned by the cold, unyielding earth is a torment few aarakocra can withstand. Even when perched on a high branch or at rest in their mountaintop homes, they appear alert, with eyes moving and bodies ready to take flight.": "监禁使阿拉科拉人感到恐惧。被禁足，被困在地下，或被冰冷不屈的大地囚禁，是很少有阿拉科克拉人能够承受的折磨。即使是栖息在高高的树枝上或在山顶的家中休息，它们也显得很警觉，眼睛在动，身体准备飞起来。",
	"Most aarakocra live on the Elemental Plane of Air. Aarakocra can be drawn into the Material Plane, sometimes to pursue enemies or thwart their foes' designs there. Accident might also send a nest of aarakocra tumbling into a world on that plane. A few find their way to such a world through portals on their own plane and establish nests in high mountains or in the canopies of old forests.": "大多数阿拉科克拉人生活在空气元素界。Aarakocra可以被吸引到物质位面，有时是为了追击敌人或挫败敌人在那里的设计。意外事故也可能使一窝阿拉科克拉翻滚着进入该平面的世界。少数会通过自己位面的传送门找到这样的世界，并在高山上或古老森林的树冠上建立巢穴。",
	"Once tribes of aarakocra settle in an area, they share a hunting territory that extends across an area up to 100 miles on a side, with each tribe hunting in the lands nearest to their colony, ranging farther should game become scarce.": "一旦Aarakocra部落在一个地区定居，他们就会共享一个狩猎领地，该领地边长达100英里，每个部落都在离其殖民地最近的土地上狩猎，如果猎物变得稀少，则范围更广。",
	"A typical colony consists of one large, open-roofed nest made of woven vines. The eldest acts as leader with the support of a shaman.": "一个典型的群落由一个用藤蔓编织的大型敞篷巢穴组成。最年长的人在萨满的支持下充当领袖。",
	"Never well established in Faerûn, aarakocra have only four major colonies: in the Star Mounts within the High Forest, in the Storm Horns in Cormyr, in the Cloven Mountains on the Vilhon Reach, and in the Mistcliffs in Chult.": "阿拉科拉在法鲁恩从来没有很好地建立过，只有四个主要的殖民地：在高级森林的星辰山，在科米尔的风暴之角，在维尔洪河畔的梭罗山，以及在楚尔特的雾崖。",
	"Those colonies established in the Star Mounts, closest to the Dessarin Valley, were ever a secretive and guarded people, only spotted during their flights over the High Forest. A cruel and rapacious green dragon nearly wiped out the population and scattered the survivors. These aarakocra and their descendants have sworn vengeance against the dragon and may be seen scouring the lands of the North and Cormyr for signs of their foe.": "那些建立在离德萨林谷最近的星辰山的殖民地，从来都是一个神秘的、被保护的民族，只有在他们飞越高级森林时才会被发现。一条残忍而贪婪的绿龙几乎消灭了这些人，并使幸存者四散。这些阿拉科克拉人和他们的后裔发誓要向龙复仇，并且可以看到他们在北方和科米尔的土地上搜寻敌人的痕迹。",
	"Their only remaining settlement lies on the slopes of the Star Mounts' southernmost mountains. At the headwaters of the Unicorn Run, the Last Aerie is home to several dozen aarakocra. Recently, aarakocra elders detected changes in the prevailing winds that they regarded as a bad omen.": "他们唯一剩下的定居点位于星山最南端的山坡上。在独角兽河的上游，最后的Aerie是几十个Aarakocra的家。最近，Aarakocra的长老们发现盛行风的变化，他们认为这是一个坏兆头。",
	"Unlike the aarakocra of other worlds on the Material Plane, the aarakocra of the Realms rarely travel to the Elemental Plane of Air.": "与物质界其他世界的阿拉科克拉不同，王国的阿拉科克拉很少前往空气元素界。",
	"Aarakocra enjoy peace and solitude. Most of them have little interest in dealing with other peoples and less interest in spending time on the ground. For this reason, it takes an exceptional circumstance for an aarakocra to leave his or her tribe and undertake the adventurer's life. Neither treasure nor glory is enough to lure them from their tribes; a dire threat to their people, a mission of vengeance, or a catastrophe typically lies at the heart of the aarakocra adventurer's chosen path.": "Aarakocra享受和平和孤独。他们中的大多数人对与其他民族打交道兴趣不大，对在地面上花时间的兴趣更小。由于这个原因，一个阿拉科克拉人需要在特殊情况下离开他或她的部落，过上冒险家的生活。宝藏和荣誉都不足以吸引他们离开部落；他们的人民面临着可怕的威胁，一个复仇的任务，或者一场灾难，通常是arakocra冒险家选择道路的核心所在。",
	"Two other circumstances might call an aarakocra to adventure. First, aarakocra have historical ties to the Wind Dukes of Aqaa. Exceptional individuals honor that connection and might seek out the missing pieces of the Rod of Seven Parts, the remains of an artifact fashioned by the Wind Dukes long ago to defeat the Queen of Chaos's monstrous champion, Miska the Wolf-Spider.": "还有两种情况可能会召唤阿拉科克拉人去冒险。首先，Aarakocra与Aqaa的风公爵有历史联系。特殊的人尊重这种关系，并可能寻找七部之棒的缺失部分，这是风公爵很久以前为打败混沌女王的怪物冠军狼蛛米斯卡而制造的神器遗迹。",
	"When plunged into Miska's body, the chaos in his blood sundered the rod and scattered its pieces across the multiverse. Recovering the pieces means gaining honor and esteem in the eyes of the vaati who forged it and could possibly restore a powerful weapon for defense against the agents of elemental evil.": "当插入Miska的身体时，他血液中的混沌将棍子分解，并将其碎片散落在多元宇宙中。恢复这些碎片意味着在铸造它的瓦提人眼中获得荣誉和尊敬，并可能恢复一个强大的武器，以防御元素邪恶的代理人。",
	"Second, aarakocra are sworn foes of elemental earth, in particular the gargoyles that serve Ogrémoch, the Prince of Earth. The Aarakocra word for gargoyle is loosely translated as \"flying rock,\" and battles between aarakocra and gargoyles have raged across the Elemental Planes of Earth and Air, occasionally spilling into a world on the Material Plane. Aarakocra on that plane might leave their colonies to lend aid to other humanoids committed to fighting earth cults and thwarting their efforts.": "其次，Aarakocra是地球元素的死敌，尤其是为地球王子奥格瑞莫赫服务的巨妖。Aarakocra对夜行神龙的说法被松散地翻译为 \"飞石\"，Aarakocra和夜行神龙之间的战斗已经在地球和空气的元素界肆虐，偶尔会蔓延到物质界的世界。物质界的阿拉科克拉可能会离开他们的殖民地，向其他致力于打击地球邪教并挫败其努力的人类提供援助。",
	"As with much of their speech, aarakocra names include clicks, trills, and whistles to the point that other peoples have a difficult time pronouncing them. Typically, a name has two to four syllables with the sounds acting as connectors. When interacting with other races, aarakocra may use nicknames gained from people they meet or shortened forms of their full names.": "与他们的大部分言语一样，阿拉科克拉人的名字也包括点击声、颤音和口哨声，以至于其他人很难读出它们。通常情况下，一个名字有两到四个音节，声音起到连接作用。在与其他种族交往时，阿拉科克拉人可能会使用从他们遇到的人那里获得的绰号或全名的缩写形式。",
	"An aarakocra of either gender may have one of these short names: Aera, Aial, Aur, Deekek, Errk, Heehk, Ikki, Kleeck, Oorr, Ouss, Quaf, Quierk, Salleek, Urreek, or Zeed.": "任何性别的阿拉科克拉都可以有这些简短的名字之一。Aera, Aial, Aur, Deekek, Errk, Heehk, Ikki, Kleeck, Oorr, Ouss, Quaf, Quierk, Salleek, Urreek, 或Zeed。",
	"Backgrounds that are most appropriate for aarakocra include the outlander, the hermit, and the sage.": "最适合阿拉科克拉的背景包括外乡人、隐士和圣人。",
	"The small colonies of aarakocra are insular and remote, and few aarakocra live away from their roosts. In the Star Mounts of the High Forest in the Forgotten Realms, no more than a few dozen aarakocra live away from the nests of their families. Those that do are usually rangers or fighters, constantly patrolling for outside threats.": "Aarakocra的小聚居地是孤立和偏远的，很少有Aarakocra离开它们的巢穴而生活。在被遗忘的领域中的高级森林的星辰山，不超过几十个arakocra住在他们家庭的巢穴之外。那些人通常是护林员或战士，不断巡逻以防止外部威胁。",
	"A winged people who originated on the Elemental Plane of Air, aarakocra soar through the sky wherever they wander. The first aarakocra served the Wind Dukes of Aaqa—mighty beings of air—and were imbued with a measure of their masters' power over winds. Their descendants still command echoes of that power.": "一个起源于空气元素界的有翼民族，无论他们在哪里游荡，阿拉科克拉都能在天空中翱翔。最早的阿拉科克拉为阿卡的风公爵--强大的空气生物服务，并被赋予了他们的主人对风的力量。他们的后代仍然拥有这种力量的回声。",
	"From below, aarakocra look like large birds and thus are sometimes called birdfolk. Only when they roost on a branch or walk across the ground is their Humanoid nature clear. Standing upright, aarakocra are typically about 5 feet tall, and they have long, narrow legs that taper to sharp talons. Feathers cover their bodies—usually red, orange, yellow, brown, or gray. Their heads are also avian, often resembling those of parrots or eagles.": "从下面看，Aarakocra看起来像大鸟，因此有时被称为鸟人。只有当它们在树枝上栖息或在地面上行走时，它们的类人本性才清晰可见。直立时，阿拉科克拉通常有5英尺高，他们有狭长的腿，渐渐变成锋利的爪子。羽毛覆盖着他们的身体--通常是红色、橙色、黄色、棕色或灰色。它们的头部也是禽类，通常类似于鹦鹉或鹰的头部。",
	"Whether descended from a celestial being or infused with heavenly power, aasimar are mortals who carry a spark of the Upper Planes within their souls. They can fan that spark to bring light, ease wounds, and unleash the fury of the heavens.": "不管是来自天人的后裔，还是被注入了天国的力量，阿西玛人都是在灵魂中带着上层世界的火花的凡人。他们可以用这种火花带来光明，缓解伤口，并释放出天堂的愤怒。",
	"Aasimar can arise among any population of mortals. They resemble their parents, but they live for up to 160 years and often have features that hint at their celestial heritage. These often begin subtle and become more obvious when the aasimar gains the ability to reveal their full celestial nature. The Aasimar Celestial Features table has examples you can choose or use as inspiration to create your own.": "Aasimar可以在任何凡人群体中出现。他们与他们的父母相似，但他们的寿命长达160年，并且经常有一些暗示他们天人遗产的特征。这些特征开始时很微妙，当阿西玛人获得了揭示其全部天人本性的能力时就会变得更加明显。阿西玛人的天体特征表有一些例子，你可以选择或作为灵感来创造你自己的。",
	"A dusting of metallic, white, or charcoal freckles": "一片金属色、白色或炭色的雀斑粉尘",
	"Metallic, luminous, or dark eyes": "金属的、发光的或黑暗的眼睛",
	"Starkly colored hair": "颜色鲜明的头发",
	"An unusual hue tinting your shadow": "一个不寻常的色调染红了你的影子",
	"A ghostly halo crowning your head": "幽灵般的光环在你的头上加冕",
	"Rainbows gleaming on your skin": "在你的皮肤上闪耀着彩虹",
	"Aasimar bear within their souls the light of the heavens. They are descended from humans with a touch of the power of Mount Celestia, the divine realm of many lawful good deities. Aasimar are born to serve as champions of the gods, their births hailed as blessed events. They are a people of otherworldly visages, with luminous features that reveal their celestial heritage.": "阿西玛人的灵魂中蕴含着天堂之光。他们是人类的后代，带有天山的力量，天山是许多合法善神的神圣领域。阿西玛人出生时是作为众神的拥护者，他们的出生被誉为受祝福的事件。他们是一个有着超凡容貌的民族，发光的特征显示了他们的天体遗产。",
	"With your DM's consent, you can change your character's subrace to fallen aasimar if your protector/scourge aasimar turns to evil. To do so, replace your subrace benefits, including the ability score increase, with those of a fallen aasimar.": "经DM同意，如果你的保护者/祸害阿西玛尔变成了邪恶，你可以将你的角色的亚种改为堕落阿西玛尔。要做到这一点，就要用堕落的阿西玛人的优点来取代你的亚种的优点，包括能力分数的增加。",
	"Similarly, if your fallen aasimar turns to good, your DM might allow you to become a protector or scourge aasimar.": "同样地，如果你的堕落的阿西玛尔变成了好人，你的DM可能会允许你成为一个保护者或祸害阿西玛尔。",
	"Aasimar are placed in the world to serve as guardians of law and good. Their patrons expect them to strike at evil, lead by example, and further the cause of justice.": "Aasimar被安置在这个世界上，充当法律和善的守护者。他们的赞助人希望他们能够打击邪恶，以身作则，并促进正义事业。",
	"From an early age, an aasimar receives visions and guidance from celestial entities via dreams. These dreams help shape an aasimar, granting a sense of destiny and a desire for righteousness.": "从很小的时候起，阿西玛人就通过梦境接受天体的幻觉和指导。这些梦境有助于塑造阿西玛尔，赋予其命运感和对正义的渴望。",
	"Each aasimar can count a specific celestial agent of the gods as a guide. This entity is typically a deva, an angel who acts as a messenger to the mortal world.": "每个阿西玛人都可以算上一个特定的天神代理人作为向导。这个实体通常是一个魔王，一个充当凡人世界的信使的天使。",
	"While aasimar are strident foes of evil, they typically prefer to keep a low profile. An aasimar inevitably draws the attention of evil cultists, fiends, and other enemies of good, all of whom would be eager to strike down a celestial champion if they had the chance.": "虽然阿西玛尔是邪恶的坚定敌人，但他们通常更喜欢保持低调。一个阿西玛尔不可避免地会引起邪恶的邪教徒、恶魔和其他正义的敌人的注意，如果有机会的话，他们都会急于击倒一个天神的冠军。",
	"When traveling, aasimar prefer hoods, closed helms, and other gear that allows them to conceal their identities. They nevertheless have no compunction about striking openly at evil. The secrecy they desire is never worth endangering the innocent.": "旅行时，阿西玛人喜欢戴头罩、封闭的头盔，以及其他能让他们掩盖身份的装备。然而，他们对公开打击邪恶毫无顾忌。他们渴望的秘密绝不值得危害无辜者。",
	"An aasimar, except for one who has turned to evil, has a link to an angelic being. That being—usually a deva—provides guidance to the aasimar, though this connection functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is not a direct command or a simple spoken word. Instead, the aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings.": "一个阿西玛人，除了已经转向邪恶的人，与一个天使般的存在有联系。那个生命--通常是一个魔王--向阿西玛尔提供指导，尽管这种联系只在梦中发挥作用。因此，指导不是一个直接的命令或一个简单的口头语。相反，阿西玛尔会收到幻觉、预言和感觉。",
	"The angelic being is far from omniscient. Its guidance is based on its understanding of the tenets of law and good, and it might have insight into combating especially powerful evils that it knows about.": "天使的存在远非全知全能。它的指导是基于它对法律和善的信条的理解，而且它可能对打击它所知道的特别强大的邪恶有洞察力。",
	"As part of fleshing out an aasimar character, consider the nature of that character's angelic guide. The Angelic Guide tables offer names and natures that you can use to flesh out your character's guide.": "作为充实阿西玛人角色的一部分，考虑该角色的天使向导的性质。天使指南表提供了名称和性质，你可以用它来充实你的角色的指南。",

	"The deva, or other celestial being, is your chance to add special roleplaying opportunities to the game. Remember, a deva lives in a realm of absolute law and good. The deva might not understand the compromises and hard choices that mortals must grapple with in the world. To the deva, an aasimar is a prized student who must live up to high, sometimes inflexible standards.": "魔王，或其他天人，是你为游戏增加特殊角色扮演机会的机会。请记住，魔王生活在一个绝对的法律和善的领域。魔鬼可能不理解凡人在这个世界上必须努力的妥协和艰难的选择。对魔王来说，阿西玛人是一个珍贵的学生，必须达到高标准，有时是僵硬的标准。",
	"Despite its celestial origin, an aasimar is mortal and possesses free will. Most aasimar follow their ordained path, but some grow to see their abilities as a curse. These disaffected aasimar are typically content to turn away from the world, but a few become agents of evil. In their minds, their exposure to celestial powers amounted to little more than brainwashing.": "尽管是天体，但阿西玛人是凡人，拥有自由意志。大多数阿西玛人遵循他们被指定的道路，但有些人逐渐将他们的能力视为一种诅咒。这些心怀不满的阿西玛人通常满足于远离这个世界，但也有少数人成为邪恶的代理人。在他们看来，他们接触到的天体力量不过是洗脑而已。",
	"Evil aasimar make deadly foes. The radiant power they once commanded becomes corrupted into a horrid, draining magic. And their angelic guides abandon them.": "邪恶的阿西玛人是致命的敌人。他们曾经指挥的光芒万丈的力量被腐蚀成了一种可怕的、耗费精力的魔法。他们的天使向导也抛弃了他们。",
	"Even aasimar wholly dedicated to good sometimes feel torn between two worlds. The angels that guide them see the world from a distant perch. An aasimar who wishes to stop and help a town recover from a drought might be told by an angelic guide to push forward on a greater quest. To a distant angel, saving a few commoners might pale in comparison to defeating a cult of Orcus. An aasimar's guide is wise but not infallible.": "即使是完全献身于善的阿西玛，有时也会在两个世界之间感到纠结。引导他们的天使从一个遥远的高处看这个世界。一个希望停下来帮助一个城镇从干旱中恢复的阿西玛人，可能会被天使引导者告知要在更大的任务中前进。对一个遥远的天使来说，拯救几个平民可能比打败一个奥库斯的邪教更微不足道。一个阿西玛人的向导是明智的，但不是无懈可击的。",
	"Most aasimar are born from human parents, and they use the same naming conventions as their native culture.": "大多数阿西玛人都是由人类父母所生，他们使用的命名方式与他们的本土文化相同。",
	"An aasimar who was touched by dark powers as a youth or who turns to evil in early adulthood can become one of the fallen-a group of aasimar whose inner light has been replaced by shadow.": "年轻时被黑暗力量触及的阿西玛人，或在成年早期转向邪恶的阿西玛人可以成为堕落者之一--一群内心的光明被阴影取代的阿西玛人。",
	"Protector aasimar are charged by the powers of good to guard the weak, to strike at evil wherever it arises, and to stand vigilant against the darkness. From a young age, a protector aasimar receives advice and directives that urge to stand against evil.": "守护者阿西玛被善的力量责成保护弱者，打击任何出现的邪恶，并对黑暗保持警惕。从年轻时起，保护者阿西玛尔就会收到敦促其对抗邪恶的建议和指令。",
	"Scourge aasimar are imbued with a divine energy that blazes intensely within them. It feeds a powerful desire to destroy evil-a desire that is, at its best, unflinching and, at its worst, all-consuming. Many scourge aasimar wear masks to block out the world and focus on containing this power, unmasking themselves only in battle.": "Scourge aasimar被赋予了一种神圣的能量，这种能量在他们体内强烈地燃烧着。它滋养了摧毁邪恶的强大欲望--这种欲望在最好的情况下是坚定不移的，在最坏的情况下则是无所不用其极的。许多 \"祸害 \"Aasimar戴着面具遮挡世界，专注于控制这种力量，只有在战斗中才会揭开面具。",
	"Long ago, groups of elves ventured from the Feywild to the Astral Plane to be closer to their gods. Life in the Silver Void has imbued their souls with a spark of divine light. That light manifests as a starry gleam in an astral elf's eyes.": "很久以前，成群结队的精灵从精灵世界冒险来到星界，以接近他们的神灵。银色虚空中的生活为他们的灵魂注入了神圣之光的火花。这种光芒在星界精灵的眼中表现为星光闪耀。",
	"Because nothing ages in the Astral Plane, astral elves from that plane are thousands of years old, and their longevity gives them an unusual perspective on time. Some are prone to melancholy, while others display an absence of feeling. Many look for creative ways to occupy themselves. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the reaches of the multiverse, they tend to see things through the lens of time as having little or no meaning to them.": "因为在星界没有什么东西会变老，所以来自星界的精灵有几千年的历史，他们的长寿让他们对时间有不寻常的看法。有些人容易忧郁，而另一些人则表现出没有感觉。许多人寻找创造性的方法来占据自己。无论他们是选择生活在安静的沉思中，还是出去探索多元宇宙的范围，他们都倾向于通过时间的镜头来看待事物，认为这对他们没有什么意义。",

All aven have lean bodies with feathers ex-tending from their heads down to their shoulders.": "阿文有类似人类的身体、手臂和腿，以及鸟类的翅膀和头。在Naktamun发现了两种不同种类的阿文。一种有鹰或类似猎物的头，翅膀很短，可以快速飞行。另一个品种有一个朱鹭的头，长长的脖子，宽而有棱角的翅膀更适合于翱翔。所有这些鸟都有瘦小的身体，羽毛从头部一直延伸到肩部。",
	"Aven delight in flying above their foes, using their superior mobility to confound and outpace their opponents. They love soaring through the sky as well, though the Hekma limits their altitude. Like all people of Naktamun, they are grateful for the Hekma's protective magic, of course. But they keenly anticipate the hour when the God-Pharaoh will return and dissolve the veil, letting them fly without limit in the afterlife.": "阿文喜欢在他们的敌人上方飞行，利用他们优越的机动性来迷惑和超越他们的对手。他们也喜欢在天空中翱翔，尽管赫克马限制了他们的飞行高度。像所有Naktamun的人一样，他们当然感谢Hekma的保护性魔法。但他们热切地期待着神-法老回来的那一刻，解散面纱，让他们在来世无限制地飞行。",
	"Spellcasters are common among ibis-headed aven drawn to follow the teachings of Kefnet. Their physical resemblance to the god of knowledge is reflected in the metal discipline, focus, and confidence for which aven spellcasters are known. They wield magic of air, wind, and sometimes water to buffet their foes, enhance their own flight, and counter enemy attacks. Hawk-headed aven who follow the path of the mage are more likely to learn sand-based magic that can cloud the air, blast their foes, or bury enemies in living dunes.": "施法者在被吸引来追随凯弗内特教义的朱鹭头阿文中很常见。他们与知识之神的身体相似，反映在金属的纪律、专注和自信上，这也是阿文的法术师们所熟知的。他们挥舞着空气、风的魔法，有时也挥舞着水的魔法来打击他们的敌人，增强自己的飞行能力，并反击敌人的攻击。走法师之路的鹰头人更有可能学习以沙子为基础的魔法，这些魔法可以使空气混浊，爆炸他们的敌人，或将敌人埋在活的沙丘中。",
	"Hawk-headed aven are often drawn to master tech-niques of long-range combat, whether the javelin that is the preferred weapon of many, the bow, or other thrown weapons. Whatever weapon they use, aven hover and swoop in the air above the fray, seeking the opportune moment to strike in exactly the right place. In line with the teachings of the god of solidarity, they often fly in tight formations with other aven in their crops, supporting and protecting each other. Aven take great pride in the precision of their attacks, relying on their keen vision and superior vantage points. They view the sharp tip of a {@item javelin|phb} or {@item arrow|phb} as a symbol of their love for precision, and some initiates maintain carefully tended collections of spearheads or arrowheads.": "鹰头人经常被吸引到掌握远程战斗的技术，无论是许多人喜欢的标枪、弓，还是其他投掷武器。无论他们使用什么武器，阿文都会在战场上方的空中盘旋和俯冲，寻找合适的时机，在正确的地方进行攻击。根据团结之神的教诲，他们经常与其他阿文一起以紧密的队形飞行，相互支持和保护。阿文对其攻击的精确性感到非常自豪，这要依靠他们敏锐的眼光和优越的地理位置。他们把{@item javelin|phb}或{@item arrow|phb}的锋利尖端看作是他们对精确性的热爱的象征，一些入会者还精心保管着矛头或箭头的收藏。",
	"A relatively small number of aven of both varieties end up focusing on hand-to-hand combat. Even there, they use their ability to fly to great advantage, often swooping down on their foes from a great height. The speed and power of a blow from a diving aven can be utterly devastating, but such a strike poses a tremendous risk to the aven as well as the target. An aven who fails to pull up from the dive in time can suffer even worse injuries than the target of the attack. Aven often minimize this risk by hurling {@item javelin|phb|javelins} while they dive, then pulling up early after a successful throw.": "这两个品种中相对较少的精灵最终专注于手对手的战斗。即使在那里，他们也会利用自己的飞行能力来发挥巨大的优势，经常从很高的地方俯冲下来攻击他们的敌人。俯冲的阿文的速度和力量可以带来巨大的破坏力，但这种打击对阿文和目标都构成了巨大的风险。一个复仇者如果不能及时从俯冲中拉起，可能会遭受比攻击目标更严重的伤害。复仇者通常通过在下潜时投掷{@item javelin|phb|javelins}，然后在成功投掷后提前拉起，来减少这种风险。",
	"A majority of ibis-headed aven, drawn to the teachings of Kefnet, specialize in spellcasting. They take great pride in all the qualities they share with the god of knowledge—not just their avian heads, but their quick wit, self-confidence, cunning, and spellcasting prowess.": "大多数朱雀头的阿文，被凯菲特的教义所吸引，专门从事法术研究。他们对自己与知识之神共享的所有品质感到非常自豪--不仅仅是他们的鸟头，还有他们的急智、自信、狡猾和法术能力。",
	"Neither bugs nor bears, bugbears are the hulking cousins of goblins and hobgoblins. With roots in the Feywild, early bugbears resided in hidden places, in hard-to-reach and shadowed spaces. Long ago and from out of the corner of your eye, they came to the Material Plane, urged to spread throughout the multiverse by the conquering god Maglubiyet. Centuries later, they still bear a fey gift for lurking just out of sight, and many of them have sneaked away from that god's influence.": "既不是虫子也不是熊，虫熊是地精和妖精的庞大表亲。早期的虫熊扎根于精灵世界，居住在隐蔽的地方，在难以触及的阴影空间。很久以前，从你的眼角余光中，他们来到了物质世界，被征服者马格卢比耶特神敦促着在整个多元宇宙传播。几个世纪后，他们仍然具有潜伏在视线之外的精灵天赋，他们中的许多人已经偷偷地离开了那位神的影响。",
	"They are long of limb and covered in coarse hair, with wedge-shaped ears and pointed teeth. Despite their formidable build, bugbears are quiet skulkers, thanks to a fey magic that allows them to hide in spaces seemingly too small for them.": "他们四肢修长，浑身长满粗毛，有楔形的耳朵和尖牙。尽管它们的身材很强壮，但虫熊是安静的潜行者，这要归功于一种精灵的魔法，它可以让它们藏在对它们来说似乎太小的空间里。",
	"In the sprawling city of Ravnica, where \"open road\" seems like a contradiction and \"open plain\" is sheer nonsense, centaurs nevertheless retain a love of wide spaces and the freedom to travel. As much as they can, centaurs run—in wide plazas, spacious parks, and expanses of rubble and ruin. They race the wind, hooves thundering and tails streaming behind them, until the next wall looms in their path and brings them to a stop.": "在Ravnica这个庞大的城市里，\"开放的道路 \"似乎是一个矛盾，而 \"开放的平原 \"则完全是无稽之谈，但半人马仍然对广阔的空间和自由的旅行充满了热爱。半人马尽可能地在宽阔的广场、宽敞的公园和大片的瓦砾和废墟中奔跑。他们与风赛跑，蹄声如雷，尾随其后，直到下一堵墙出现在他们的道路上，使他们停下来。",
	"Centaurs have the upper bodies, down to the waist, of muscular humans, displaying all the human variety of skin tones and features. Their ears are slightly pointed, but their faces are wider and squarer than those of elves. Below the waist, they have the bodies of small horses, with a similar range of coloration—from various shades of chestnut or bay to dappled or even zebra-like striped patterns. Most centaurs style their hair and their tails in a similar way. Selesnya centaurs favor long, flowing hair. Gruul centaurs cut their hair in rough, spiky styles.": "半人马的上半身，直到腰部，都是肌肉发达的人类，显示出所有人类的各种肤色和特征。他们的耳朵稍尖，但他们的脸比精灵更宽更方。腰部以下，他们有小马的身体，有类似的颜色范围--从各种深浅不一的栗色或海湾色到斑驳甚至斑马状的条纹图案。大多数半人马的头发和尾巴的样式都差不多。Selesnya半人马喜欢长而飘逸的头发。格鲁尔半人马将他们的头发剪成粗糙、尖锐的样式。",
	"The upper bodies of centaurs are comparable to human torsos in size, and their lower equine bodies average about 4 feet tall at the withers. Though they are smaller than a human rider mounted on a horse, they fill similar roles as cavalry warriors, messengers, outriders, and scouts.": "半人马的上半身与人类的躯干大小相当，其下半身的马身平均约有4英尺高，在肩部。虽然他们比骑在马上的人类骑手要小，但他们扮演着类似于骑兵战士、信使、逃兵和侦察兵的角色。",
	"Centaurs have an affinity for the natural world. Among the guilds that share that affinity, centaurs favor the rubblebelts of the Gruul Clans and the wide plazas of the Selesnya Conclave over the undercity tunnels of the Golgari and the laboratories of the Simic.": "半人马对自然世界有一种亲和力。在拥有这种亲和力的公会中，半人马更喜欢格鲁尔氏族的瓦砾地带和塞勒斯尼亚公会的宽阔广场，而不是戈尔加里的城市地下隧道和西米克的实验室。",
	"Centaurs celebrate life and growth, and the birth of a foal is always cause for festivities. At the same time, they revere the traditions of the past, and among both the Gruul and the Selesnya they are voices of memory and history, preserving old ways and keeping alive the legends of ancestral heroes. They feel a close kinship with wild animals, perhaps because of their own horse-like bodies, and delight in the feeling of running alongside herds and packs of other beasts.": "半人马庆祝生命和成长，小马驹的出生总是值得庆祝的。同时，他们崇尚过去的传统，在格鲁尔人和塞勒斯尼亚人中，他们是记忆和历史的代言人，保留着古老的方式，并使祖先的英雄传说得以延续。他们感到与野生动物有密切的亲属关系，也许是因为他们自己有像马一样的身体，并乐于与其他野兽的群落一起奔跑的感觉。",
	"Centaurs sense the interconnectedness of the natural world. Thus, they celebrate family and community as microcosms of that greater connection. Among the Gruul, they have a strong clan identity, and Selesnya centaurs are fiercely loyal to their individual communities as well as the guild as a whole. Their love of history and tradition also means that centaurs are more likely than most other Ravnicans to join the same guild that their parents did.": "半人马感觉到自然界的相互联系。因此，他们把家庭和社区作为这种更大联系的缩影来庆祝。在格鲁尔人中，他们有强烈的部族认同感，塞勒斯尼亚半人马对他们的个人社区以及整个公会都非常忠诚。他们对历史和传统的热爱也意味着半人马比其他大多数拉夫尼科人更有可能加入他们父母的同一个公会。",
	"Centaurs' given names are passed down through family lines. The name bestowed on a new foal is typically the name of the most recently deceased family member of the same gender, keeping alive the memory—and, the centaurs believe, some shard of the spirit—of the departed. Centaurs don't use family names, but they wear symbols that represent their family membership. These symbols might include graphical representations of plants or animals, printed mottoes, braids and beads worn in the hair and tail, or even specific patterns of woven fabric.": "半人马的名字是通过家族遗传下来的。赐予新马驹的名字通常是最近去世的同性别家庭成员的名字，以保持记忆--半人马认为，是离世者的一些精神碎片。半人马不使用姓氏，但他们佩戴代表其家族成员的符号。这些符号可能包括植物或动物的图形代表，印刷的座右铭，头发和尾巴上佩戴的辫子和珠子，甚至是编织的特定图案。",
	"Powerful and curious, quick to act and knowledgeable of the wider world, centaurs seek to experience life's boundless bounty. The centaurs of Theros are divided into two groups: members of the far-traveling Lagonna band and the proud raiders of the Pheres band. These bands occupy territories situated between the three major human poleis, making them common sights to those who travel human lands. Not ones to settle in permanent homes, though, centaurs might be found wherever there are wonders to be witnessed and adventures to be had.": "半人马力量强大，好奇心强，行动迅速，对更广阔的世界了如指掌，他们寻求体验生活的无尽恩惠。泰罗斯的半人马分为两组：远行的Lagonna部落成员和骄傲的Pheres部落突击队员。这些队伍占据着位于三个主要人类极地之间的领土，使他们成为那些在人类土地上旅行的人的常见风景。不过，半人马并不定居在永久的家园里，只要有奇迹可看，有冒险可做，就能找到他们。",
	"Though centaurs share the same basic physiology, the centaur bands are commonly associated with their own distinct traits.": "虽然半人马有相同的基本生理结构，但半人马带通常与他们自己的独特特征有关。",
	"Lagonna band centaurs tend to be sleek and muscular, with powerful legs built for endurance rather than speed. They usually have coats of a single color, often with a shine that can look metallic in bright light.": "拉戈纳带半人马往往是光滑的，肌肉发达的，有强大的腿，为耐力而不是速度而生。他们通常有单一颜色的外套，通常有一种光泽，在明亮的光线下看起来像金属。",
	"Pheres band centaurs typically have long, nimble legs and lean bodies, and are often marked with natural color patterns on their hide. Pheres centaurs sometimes paint or tattoo their upper bodies to match the patterns on their lower half. Occasionally, a Pheres centaur is born with vertical stripes on their hooves, foretelling an exciting and adventurous life.": "Pheres带半人马通常有长而灵活的腿和瘦小的身体，他们的皮上通常有天然的颜色图案。Pheres半人马有时会在上半身涂抹或刺青以配合下半身的图案。偶尔，佩雷斯半人马的蹄子上会有垂直的条纹，预示着他们会有一个令人兴奋和冒险的生活。",
	"A barterer negotiates deals between the guros and other traders. Barterers must know the customs of other cultures and speak several different languages.": "易货商在古罗人和其他商人之间谈判交易。讨价还价者必须了解其他文化的习俗，并会说几种不同的语言。",
	"An omener is an oracle who reads messages from the gods in the natural world and reveals how the immortals would have the guros travel.": "预言家是一个神谕者，他从自然界的神灵那里读取信息，并揭示不朽者将如何让古罗斯旅行。",
	"A courser explores new trade territory for their guros. They are expert trackers and navigators, able to venture deep into unexplored territory and unerringly return to their families.": "马车夫为他们的古罗斯探索新的贸易领域。他们是专业的追踪者和导航员，能够深入到未开发的领域，并准确无误地返回到他们的家庭。",
	"Finally, every guros tries to travel with at least one koletra, one of the mighty, well-trained warriors of the Lagonna who are said to have the blood of the first, legendary centaur heroes. Koletras are said to bring good luck to a band, but are also usually fated to die in defense of their family. Not every guros has a koletra of its own, and guri share their best warriors among each other as a sign of goodwill and a way to forge bonds.": "最后，每个古罗斯人都试图与至少一个科勒特拉一起旅行，科勒特拉是拉贡人中强大的、训练有素的战士之一，据说他们拥有最早的、传说中的半人马英雄的血液。据说Koletras会给一个乐队带来好运，但通常也注定要为保卫自己的家庭而牺牲。并非每个古罗斯都有自己的科勒特拉，古里在彼此之间分享他们最好的战士，以示善意，也是建立联系的一种方式。",
	"The Pheres roam the wild lands between Setessa and Akros in small raiding herds. These herds are voluntary associations, in contrast to the family groups of the Lagonna. When necessary, several small bands join together in a larger herd to target particularly dangerous but resource-rich targets—be they humanoid traders or roving, greedy monsters. Bands also join together to defeat common threats or to hunt for game.": "佩雷斯人在塞特萨和阿克罗斯之间的荒地上游荡，形成了小型的袭击群。这些族群是自愿组成的，与拉贡人的家族团体不同。在必要的时候，几个小族群会联合起来，组成一个更大的族群，瞄准特别危险但资源丰富的目标--无论是人形商人还是游荡的、贪婪的怪兽。队伍也会联合起来打败共同的威胁，或者猎取猎物。",
	"The Pheres value physical strength, speed, and prowess in both hunting and combat. Often a band is led by the strongest and most dominant warrior, called the charger. However, some bands elevate a tactician or strategist to this venerated position. The Pheres can be brutal and greedy, but they are clever as well, and understand the value of strategic leadership.": "佩雷斯人重视体力、速度，以及在狩猎和战斗中的能力。通常情况下，一支队伍由最强壮和最有统治力的战士领导，他被称为充军者。然而，有些部落将战术家或战略家提升到这个受人尊敬的位置。佩雷斯人可能很野蛮和贪婪，但他们也很聪明，并懂得战略领导的价值。",
	"Other centaurs in Pheres herds work as scouts, archers, warriors, and foragers. In addition, most Pheres herds contain a caller and a tromper.": "其他半人马在Pheres兽群中担任侦察兵、弓箭手、战士和觅食者。此外，大多数Pheres兽群中都有一个呼唤者和一个践踏者。",
	"Pheres callers are typically druids or rangers who can draw animal assistance to their herd. Callers often have one or more animal allies at their side, and can speak to animals to learn about the surrounding lands.": "Pheres召唤者通常是德鲁伊或游侠，他们可以将动物援助引向他们的兽群。召唤者身边通常有一个或多个动物盟友，并能与动物交谈，了解周围的土地情况。",
	"Trompers are the most powerful and feared warriors of the herd. Centaur legends say that when the gods first fashioned humans from the red mud of the eldest river, Pheres trompers taught them how to corner and kill prey. The story tells that, to repay this debt, humans owe the centaurs a portion of what they catch. While humans don't recall this arrangement, the Pheres often cite it as justification for their raids.": "Trompers是兽群中最强大、最可怕的战士。半人马的传说说，当众神第一次从最古老的河流的红泥中塑造人类时，Pheres trompers教他们如何捕捉和杀死猎物。故事说，为了偿还这笔债务，人类欠半人马一部分他们捕获的东西。虽然人类不记得这个安排，但Pheres经常引用它作为他们袭击的理由。",
	"Pheres band members survive by working and fighting together, but still some centaurs choose to strike out on their own. These renegades often feel like outsiders in their own band. They might be pacifists, wishing to learn about other people rather than fighting them. Or they might feel a restlessness in their soul that nothing else can soothe. Though renegades build their own life away from the band, most retain some connection with their past. Some stories tell of renegades returning to help their band in times of need before disappearing once more.": "Pheres乐队成员通过一起工作和战斗而生存，但仍有一些半人马选择独立出击。这些叛逆者常常觉得自己在自己的乐队中是局外人。他们可能是和平主义者，希望了解其他人而不是与他们战斗。或者他们可能感到灵魂中的不安，没有什么可以抚慰。虽然叛逆者在远离乐队的地方建立了自己的生活，但大多数人都与他们的过去保持着某种联系。有些故事说，叛逆者在需要的时候会回来帮助他们的乐队，然后再一次消失。",
	"Lagonna centaurs tend to favor names of three or four syllables, often borrowed from cultures they have met during their travels. Pheres centaurs tend to have shorter, sharper sounding names, often appended with an honorific gained in battle.": "拉贡半人马倾向于使用三或四个音节的名字，这些名字通常是从他们在旅行中遇到的文化中借用的。Pheres半人马倾向于拥有更短的、听起来更尖锐的名字，通常附加一个在战斗中获得的荣誉称号。",

	"Long ago there was a woman named Jes, and she had one hundred children. Her rivals conspired against her and swore to kill her children. Jes begged the Sovereigns for help, but their only answer was the wind and rain. In the depths of her despair, a lonely traveler took her hand. \"I will protect your children if they follow my path. Let them wander the world. They may be shunned and feared, but they will never be destroyed.\" Jes agreed, and the traveler gave her his cloak. When she draped it over her children, their old faces melted away and they could be whoever they wanted to be. And so it remains. Though the children are shunned by all, the gift of the Traveler protects them still.": "很久以前，有一个女人叫Jes，她有一百个孩子。她的对手阴谋反对她，发誓要杀死她的孩子。杰西向君主们乞求帮助，但他们唯一的回答是风和雨。在她绝望的深处，一个孤独的旅行者拉着她的手。\"如果你的孩子跟随我的道路，我将保护他们。让他们在世界范围内流浪。他们可能会被回避和恐惧，但他们永远不会被毁灭。\" 杰西同意了，那个旅行者把他的斗篷给了她。当她把它披在她的孩子身上时，他们的老脸融化了，他们可以成为他们想成为的任何人。就这样，它依然存在。虽然孩子们被所有人回避，但旅行者的礼物仍然保护着他们。",
	"Changelings can shift their forms with a thought. Many changelings use this gift as a form of artistic and emotional expression. It's also an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and others who wish to deceive. This leads many people to treat changelings with suspicion.": "变身者可以通过一个念头来转换他们的形态。许多变身者将这种天赋作为一种艺术和情感表达的形式。对于骗子、间谍和其他希望欺骗的人来说，这也是一个无价的工具。这导致许多人以怀疑的态度对待变化人。",

	"Changelings are born to one of three paths. A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, families who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler.": "变种人出生在三条道路中的一条。少数人在稳定的社区中长大，在那里，变种人忠于自己的本性，与周围的人坦诚相待。有些是孤儿，由其他种族抚养长大，他们在这个世界上找到了自己的道路，却从未认识过像他们一样的人。其他人则是遍布五国的游牧变种人氏族的一部分，他们的真实本性不为单皮人所知。一些部族在主要城市和社区保持着安全的庇护所，但大多数人更愿意在被称为旅行者的神的不可预知的道路上游荡。",

	"In their true form, changelings are pale, with colorless eyes and silver-white hair. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shape—one created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history—is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth. They build an identity over time, crafting a persona with a history and beliefs. This focused identity helps a changeling pinpoint a particular skill or emotion. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.": "在他们的真实形态下，变种人脸色苍白，眼睛无色，头发银白。很少看到变种人的这种形态，因为典型的变种人改变他们的形状就像其他人改变衣服一样。一个随意的形状--一个临时创造的形状，没有深度或历史，被称为面具。面具可以用来表达一种情绪或服务于一个特定的目的，然后可能永远不会再被使用。然而，许多变化者发展出具有更多深度的身份。他们随着时间的推移建立一个身份，精心打造一个有历史和信仰的人物形象。这种集中的身份有助于改变者确定一个特定的技能或情感。一个变种人的冒险家可能有很多情况的角色，包括谈判、调查和战斗。",
	"Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; there might be three healers in a community, but whoever is on duty will adopt the persona of Tek, the kindly old medic. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users.": "角色可以由多个变化者共享；一个社区可能有三个治疗师，但无论谁在值班，都会采用善良的老医生泰克的角色。角色甚至可以通过家庭传承，让年轻的变身者利用该角色以前的使用者建立的联系。",

	"Most human initiates focus their studies on a single specialization—hand-to-hand combat, long-range combat, or magical combat.

Other hand-to-hand specialists take a broader perspective and study the use of all weapons equally.": "大多数人类入门者将他们的学习重点放在一个单一的专业上，即徒手格斗、远程格斗或魔法格斗。选择徒手格斗的人类可能会一心一意地专注于镰刀刃的khopesh的使用（视作{@item longsword|phb}）。其他徒手搏击专家则采取更广泛的视角，平等地研究所有武器的使用。",
	"Some humans, however, apply the idea of perfection through balance to these combat specializations as well, fusing multiple styles together into a unique blend. For example, a human initiate might use spells to shape sand into a sword or to wreathe arrows with life-draining magic. Other initiates strike with an axe in one hand while throwing smaller axes with the other, employing techniques of both hand-to-hand and long-range combat. Some humans use slings to launch fireballs, create illusory nets to restrain their opponents, or craft their blades from solid toxins.": "然而，一些人类也将通过平衡实现完美的理念应用于这些战斗专业，将多种风格融合在一起，形成一种独特的混合。例如，人类的入门者可能会使用法术将沙子塑造成一把剑，或者用消耗生命的魔法来缠绕箭矢。其他入门者一手拿斧头，一手投掷较小的斧头，采用徒手和远距离战斗的技术。一些人类使用吊索发射火球，创造虚幻的网来限制他们的对手，或者用固体毒素制作他们的刀片。",
	"Humans are the most numerous, diverse, and adaptable folk of Zendikar, and they form the core of most exploratory and adventurous expeditions across the plane. Though many humans huddle behind stone walls and wooden ramparts, at least somewhat protected from the perils of Zendikar, a significant number venture out from the safety of those walls to explore and defend their world. As the Eldrazi spread, more and more humans are driven out of their refuges and forced to confront the harsh reality of that alien threat.": "人类是赞迪卡星球上数量最多、种类最多、适应性最强的民族，他们是整个星球上大多数探索和冒险探险的核心。尽管许多人类蜷缩在石墙和木制城墙后面，至少在某种程度上受到保护，不受赞迪卡危险的影响，但仍有相当多的人冒险离开安全的城墙去探索和保卫他们的世界。随着埃尔德拉兹的蔓延，越来越多的人类被赶出了他们的避难所，并被迫面对这个外来威胁的残酷现实。",
	"Most human communities on Zendikar are tiny villages, remote outposts, or temporary encampments. These settlements are found on every continent, from the coastal villages of Guul Draz to the giant caravan of Goma Fada on Akoum. Without the safety of walls and ramparts, frontier life is all about the struggle for survival, leaving little time or energy for scholarly pursuits. The people of most of these communities rely on hunting, gathering, herding, and trading for the food and other goods they need. Some, however, survive by preying on the people of other communities and caravans.": "赞迪卡上的大多数人类社区都是小村庄、偏远的前哨站或临时营地。这些定居点在每个大陆上都能找到，从古尔-德拉兹的沿海村庄到阿库姆的戈马法达的巨大商队。没有城墙和壁垒的安全，边疆的生活都是为了生存而奋斗，几乎没有时间或精力去追求学术研究。这些社区中的大多数人依靠打猎、采集、放牧和交易来获得他们所需的食物和其他物品。然而，有些人则通过掠夺其他社区和商队的人而生存。",
	"Despite the harshness of life on Zendikar, human civilization flourishes in a few scattered towns. Sea Gate (on the continent of Tazeem), Affa Town (on Akoum), and the so-called Free City of Nimana (in Guul Draz) are the most notable of these, boasting organized military forces, institutions of learning, established traditions of magic, houses of worship, and dark underbellies of crime and corruption. With populations measured in the thousands, these settlements would barely qualify as towns on other planes, but they have no rivals on Zendikar except the vampire city of Malakir—which has been in ruins since the emergence of the Eldrazi.": "尽管赞迪卡大陆上的生活十分严酷，但人类文明却在一些分散的城镇中蓬勃发展。海门（位于塔泽姆大陆）、阿法镇（位于阿库姆）和所谓的尼玛纳自由城（位于古尔-德拉兹）是其中最引人注目的，它们拥有有组织的军队、学习机构、成熟的魔法传统、礼拜场所，以及犯罪和腐败的阴暗面。这些定居点的人口数以千计，在其他位面几乎没有资格成为城镇，但他们在赞迪卡没有对手，除了吸血鬼城市马拉基尔--自从艾尔德拉兹出现后，它就成了废墟。",
	"In Sea Gate, five so-called expeditionary houses launch regular excursions into the wilds for various purposes. Named for the destinations of their first expeditions, they are the Valakut House, the Pelakka Foundation, and the Akoum, Murasa, and Bala Ged Expeditionary Houses. The rivalries among the houses are legendary, and they are known to sabotage each other's expeditions. Each maintains hostels in various settlements, which serve as resources for adventurers and explorers who need to hire guides or purchase supplies.": "在海之门，有五个所谓的远征屋为了不同的目的定期到荒野中进行远征活动。它们以第一次探险的目的地命名，分别是瓦拉库特家族、佩拉卡基金会、阿库姆、穆拉萨和巴拉格德探险家族。这些房屋之间的竞争是传奇性的，他们以破坏对方的探险活动而闻名。每家都在不同的定居点设有旅馆，作为冒险家和探险家需要雇用向导或购买物资的资源。",
	"I am kalashtar, born of two worlds. Over a thousand years ago, my ancestor bound her bloodline to the spirit Kashtai, and I am a child of that union. Kashtai moves within me. Her memories come to me in dreams, and at times her voice whispers in the silence of my mind. As long as at least one of my sisters is alive, Kashtai will survive—and as long as she lives, she will fight il-Lashtavar.": "我是卡拉什塔，诞生于两个世界。一千多年前，我的祖先将她的血脉与卡什塔伊精神结合在一起，而我是这种结合的孩子。卡施泰在我体内活动。她的记忆在梦中向我走来，有时她的声音在我脑海的寂静中低语。只要我的姐妹中至少有一个人活着，卡什塔伊就会生存下去--只要她活着，她就会与拉什塔瓦战斗。",
	"The kalashtar are a compound people, created from the union of humanity and renegade spirits from the plane of dreams—spirits called quori. Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. There is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, though, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.": "卡拉什塔人是一个复合民族，由人类和来自梦境层面的叛逆精神--被称为 \"quori \"的精神--结合而成。卡拉什塔人通常被视为有智慧、有灵性的人，对他人有极大的同情心。不过，卡拉什塔人有一种明确无误的外星品质，因为他们被其他世界的灵魂的冲突所困扰。",
	"Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, a bond shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions.": "每个卡拉什塔人都与光明之灵有联系，这是他们血统中其他成员共享的纽带。卡拉什塔人看起来是人类，但他们的精神联系以各种方式影响着他们。卡拉什塔人有对称的、略带棱角的特征，当他们专注或表达强烈的情感时，他们的眼睛往往会发光。",
	"Kalashtar can't directly communicate with their quori spirits. Rather, they might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these quori dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Work together with the DM to determine the nature of your linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts, such as an orphan kalashtar raised among strangers.": "卡拉什塔人不能直接与他们的库里精神沟通。相反，他们可能会把这种关系体验为一种本能和灵感，在做梦时吸取精神的记忆。这种联系赋予卡拉什塔人轻微的幻觉能力，以及对精神攻击的保护。所有这些夸瑞的梦中精灵都是有德行的，但有些是战士，有些则更善于沉思。与DM一起工作，以确定你的链接精神的性质。一般来说，卡拉什塔人知道他们的精神的名字和性质，但有些人可能对他们的精神或他们的精神天赋的来源一无所知，例如在陌生人中长大的孤儿卡拉什塔人。",
	"The bond to the spirit can cause some kalashtar to display unusual quirks. Consider rolling or selecting a trait from the Kalashtar Quirks table.": "与精神的联系会导致一些卡拉什塔人表现出不寻常的怪癖。可以考虑从卡拉什塔怪癖表中滚动或选择一个特质。",

	"You are obsessed with Dreaming Dark conspiracies.": "你痴迷于梦幻般的黑暗阴谋。",
	"The virtuous spirits tied to the kalashtar fled from the dream-realm of Dal Quor to escape evil spirits that dominate it. The rebel quori believe that through meditation and devotion, they can change the fundamental nature of Dal Quor, shifting the balance from darkness to light. Most kalashtar communities focus on acts of devotion known as the Path of Light. But the dark powers of Dal Quor have their own plans for Eberron. Through the force known as the Dreaming Dark, these monsters manipulate the folk of Khorvaire to eliminate kalashtar whenever possible.": "与卡拉什塔联系在一起的美德的灵魂从达尔-库尔的梦境中逃出，以躲避主宰它的恶灵。叛逆的库里相信，通过冥想和奉献，他们可以改变达尔-库尔的基本性质，将平衡从黑暗转向光明。大多数卡拉什塔社区专注于被称为 \"光明之路 \"的虔诚行为。但达尔-库尔的黑暗势力对埃伯龙有自己的计划。通过被称为 \"黑暗之梦 \"的力量，这些怪物操纵着霍尔韦尔的民众，尽可能地消灭卡拉什塔人。",
	"Many kalashtar defend themselves from the Dreaming Dark by focusing on devotion to the Path of Light. Others, though, seek out the agents of the Dreaming Dark and oppose their plans, or protect the innocent however they can. Still other kalashtar grow up isolated, knowing nothing about Dal Quor or the Dreaming Dark. Such orphans might use their abilities for personal gain or otherwise act against the virtuous instincts of their quori spirits; this can cause internal conflicts and violent mood swings.": "许多卡拉什塔人通过专注于对光明之路的奉献来保护自己不受造梦的黑暗影响。然而，其他人则寻找梦幻黑暗的代理人，反对他们的计划，或尽可能地保护无辜者。还有一些卡拉什塔人在成长过程中与世隔绝，对达尔-库尔和梦境的黑暗一无所知。这样的孤儿可能会利用他们的能力谋取私利，或以其他方式违背他们的奎里精神的美德本能；这可能导致内部冲突和剧烈的情绪波动。",
	"A kalashtar name adds a personal prefix to the name of the quori spirit within the kalashtar. Such names have no relation to the kalashtar's gender.": "kalashtar名字在kalashtar内的quori精神的名字上加了一个个人前缀。这种名字与卡拉什塔的性别没有关系。",

	"Native to the world of Krynn, Kender are diminutive Humanoids that look like humans with pointed ears and diverse appearances. Kender have a supernatural curiosity that drives them on to adventures big and small. This curiosity is said to be connected to the whimsical magic of the Feywild, that some believe kender have a high affinity for. Due to their curiosity, many kender have found themselves falling through gates and portals to other planes and worlds.": "坎德人原产于克莱恩世界，是一种矮小的人形生物，看起来像人类，有着尖尖的耳朵和不同的外表。坎德人有一种超自然的好奇心，促使他们进行大大小小的冒险。这种好奇心据说与精灵世界的异想天开的魔法有关，有人认为坎德人对这种魔法有很强的亲和力。由于他们的好奇心，许多坎德人发现自己通过大门和传送门掉到了其他星球和世界。",
	"Unknown to most mortals, a magical phenomenon surrounds a kender. Spurred by their curiosity and love for trinkets, curios, and keepsakes, a kender's pouches or pockets will be magically filled with these objects. No one knows where these objects come from, not even the kender. This has led many kender to be mislabeled as thieves when they fish these items out of their pockets.": "对大多数凡人来说，坎德人身边有一种神奇的现象。在他们的好奇心和对饰品、古玩和纪念品的喜爱的刺激下，坎德人的小包或口袋里会神奇地装满这些物品。没有人知道这些东西是从哪里来的，甚至坎德人也不知道。这导致许多坎德人在从口袋里捞出这些物品时被误认为是小偷。",
	"Feathered folk who resemble ravens, kenku are blessed with keen observation and supernaturally accurate memories. None of them can remember the origin of the first kenku, however, and they often joke that there are as many kenku origin stories as there are kenku.

Other kenku recite cryptic but beautiful poems about their advent being a blessed event in which they were sent into the multiverse to observe and catalog its many wonders.": "像乌鸦一样的羽民，Kenku被赋予了敏锐的观察力和超自然的准确记忆。然而，没有人记得第一个Kenku的起源，他们经常开玩笑说，有多少Kenku的起源故事就有多少Kenku。他们中的一些人把自己的起源描绘成一种诅咒，作为一个不会飞的鸟人，注定要模仿其他人的创造。其他的肯库人则背诵神秘但美丽的诗歌，说他们的出现是一个受祝福的事件，他们被派往多元宇宙观察和记录其许多奇迹。",
	"Whatever their true origin, kenku are most often found in the Shadowfell and the Material Plane, and they tend to have the coloration typical of ravens.": "无论它们的真正来源是什么，肯库最常在阴影地带和物质界被发现，它们往往有典型的乌鸦的颜色。",
	"Haunted by an ancient crime that robbed them of their wings, the kenku wander the world as vagabonds and burglars who live at the edge of human society. Kenku suffer from a sinister reputation that is not wholly unearned, but they can prove to be valuable allies.": "由于古代的犯罪行为夺走了他们的翅膀，Kenku作为流浪者和窃贼生活在人类社会的边缘，在世界范围内徘徊。KENKU遭受着险恶的名声，这并不是完全不应该的，但他们可以被证明是有价值的盟友。",
	"The kenku once served a mysterious, powerful entity on another plane of existence. Some believe they were minions of Grazz't, while others say that they were scouts and explorers for the Wind Dukes of Aaqa. Whatever the truth, according to legend, the kenku betrayed their master. Unable to resist the lure of a beautiful sparkling treasure, the kenku plotted to steal the item and escape to the Material Plane.": "肯库人曾经为另一个存在平面上的神秘而强大的实体服务。有些人认为他们是格拉兹特的爪牙，而其他人则说他们是阿卡的风公爵的侦察员和探险家。无论真相如何，根据传说，肯库人背叛了他们的主人。由于无法抵御美丽的闪光宝物的诱惑，肯库密谋偷窃物品并逃到物质世界。",
	"Unfortunately for the kenku, their master discovered their plan before they could enact it. Enraged, the entity imposed three dreadful curses upon them. First, the kenku's beloved wings withered and fell away from their bodies, leaving them bound to the earth. Second, because their ingenuity and skill had turned toward scheming against their patron, the spark of creativity was torn from their souls. Finally, to ensure that the kenku could never divulge any secrets, their master took away their voices. Once the entity was satisfied that they had been sufficiently punished, the kenku were set loose on the Material Plane.": "对Kenku来说，不幸的是，他们的主人在他们实施计划之前就发现了他们的计划。实体被激怒了，对他们施加了三个可怕的诅咒。首先，Kenku心爱的翅膀枯萎并从他们的身体上脱落，让他们被束缚在地上。其次，由于他们的聪明才智和技能转向了对其赞助人的阴谋，创造力的火花从他们的灵魂中被撕毁。最后，为了确保Kenku永远不会泄露任何秘密，他们的主人剥夺了他们的声音。一旦实体对他们受到足够的惩罚感到满意，Kenku就被释放到物质世界。",
	"Since then, the kenku have wandered the world. They settle in places that accept them, usually bleak cities that have fallen on hard times and are overrun with crime.": "从那时起，Kenku在世界范围内游荡。他们在接受他们的地方定居，通常是那些已经陷入困境、犯罪猖獗的荒凉城市。",
	"Above all else, kenku wish to regain their ability to fly. Every kenku is born with a desire to take to the air, and those who learn spellcasting do so in hope of mastering spells that will allow them to fly. Rumors of magic items such as flying carpets, brooms capable of flight, and similar objects provoke a great desire for the kenku to acquire the items for themselves.": "最重要的是，肯库希望恢复他们的飞行能力。每个肯库人天生就有飞翔的欲望，而那些学习法术的人则是希望掌握能让他们飞翔的法术。有关魔法物品的传闻，如飞毯、能够飞行的扫帚和类似物品，激起了肯库为自己获得这些物品的巨大欲望。",
	"Despite their lack of wings, kenku love dwelling in towers and other tall structures. They seek out ruins that reach to the sky, though they lack the motivation and creativity to make repairs or fortify such places. Even so, their light weight and size allow them to dwell in rickety structures that would collapse beneath a human or an orc.": "尽管没有翅膀，肯库喜欢住在塔楼和其他高大的建筑里。他们寻找直插云霄的废墟，尽管他们缺乏动力和创造力来进行维修或加固这些地方。即便如此，他们的轻量和体型使他们能够居住在摇摇欲坠的结构中，而这些结构会在人类或兽人的脚下坍塌。",
	"Some thieves' guilds use kenku as lookouts and messengers. The kenku dwell in the tallest buildings and towers the guild controls, allowing them to lurk in the highest levels and to keep watch on the city below.": "一些盗贼行会使用肯库作为瞭望台和信使。kenku居住在公会控制的最高建筑和塔楼中，使他们能够潜伏在最高层并监视下面的城市。",
	"As a result of their lack of creativity, kenku function comfortably as minions of a powerful master. Flock leaders enforce discipline and minimize conflicts, but they fail at effective planning or crafting longterm schemes.": "由于缺乏创造力，肯库作为一个强大的主人的爪牙运作起来很舒服。群体领袖执行纪律并尽量减少冲突，但他们不能有效地规划或制定长期计划。",
	"Although unable to speak in their own voices, kenku can perfectly mimic any sound they hear, from a halfling's voice to the noise of rocks clattering down a hillside. However, kenku cannot create new sounds and can communicate only by using sounds they have heard. Most kenku use a combination of overheard phrases and sound effects to convey their ideas and thoughts.": "虽然不能用自己的声音说话，但肯库可以完美地模仿他们听到的任何声音，从半身人的声音到山坡上岩石碰撞的声音。然而，肯库不能创造新的声音，只能通过使用他们听到的声音来交流。大多数肯库人使用无意中听到的短语和声音效果的组合来表达他们的想法和思想。",
	"By the same token, kenku have no ability to invent new ideas or create new things. Kenku can copy existing items with exceptional skill, allowing them to become excellent artisans and scribes. They can copy books, make replicas of objects, and otherwise thrive in situations where they can produce large numbers of identical items. Few kenku find this work satisfying, since their quest for the freedom of flight makes them ill-suited to settle into a routine.": "同样地，Kenku没有发明新想法或创造新事物的能力。肯库能以特殊的技巧复制现有物品，使他们成为优秀的工匠和文学家。他们可以复制书籍，制作物品的复制品，并在能够生产大量相同物品的情况下茁壮成长。很少有kenku发现这项工作令人满意，因为他们对飞行自由的追求使他们不适合安于常规。",
	"Kenku gather in groups called flocks. A flock is led by the oldest and most experienced kenku with the widest store of knowledge to draw on, often called Master.": "Kenku聚集在一起的群体被称为 \"群\"。一个群体由最年长和最有经验的Kenku领导，拥有最广泛的知识储备，通常被称为主人。",
	"Although kenku can't create new things, they have a talent for learning and memorizing details. Thus, ambitious kenku can excel as superb spies and scouts. A kenku who learns of clever schemes and plans devised by other creatures can put them to use. The kenku lack the talent to improvise or alter a plan, but a wise Master sets multiple plans in motion at once, confident that underlings can follow orders to the letter.": "虽然肯库不能创造新事物，但他们有学习和记忆细节的天赋。因此，雄心勃勃的Kenku可以成为出色的间谍和侦察员。得知其他生物设计的聪明计划和方案的肯库可以将其投入使用。kenku缺乏即兴创作或改变计划的才能，但一个明智的主人会同时制定多个计划，相信下属可以严格遵守命令。",
	"For this reason, many kenku make an easy living serving as messengers, spies, and lookouts for thieves' guilds, bandits, and other criminal cartels. A network of kenku can relay a bird call or similar noise across the city, alerting their allies to the approach of a guard patrol or signaling a prime opportunity for a robbery.": "由于这个原因，许多Kenku以充当信使、间谍和为盗贼公会、强盗和其他犯罪集团放哨为生。一个Kenku网络可以将鸟叫声或类似的声音传遍整个城市，提醒他们的盟友注意警卫巡逻队的到来，或预示着抢劫的最佳时机。",
	"Since kenku can precisely reproduce any sound, the messages they carry rarely suffer degradation or shifts in meaning. Human messengers might switch words or phrases and garble a message inadvertently, but the kenku produce perfect copies of whatever they hear.": "由于Kenku可以精确地复制任何声音，他们携带的信息很少出现退化或意义上的转变。人类信使可能会在不经意间调换单词或短语，使信息变得混乱，但肯库却能完美地复制他们听到的任何信息。",
	"Kenku adventurers are usually the survivors of a flock that has sustained heavy losses, or a rare kenku who has grown weary of a life of crime.

	"Kenku adventurers, despite their relative independence, still have a tendency to seek out a companion to emulate and follow. A kenku loves to mimic the voice and words of its chosen companion.": "Kenku冒险者，尽管他们相对独立，但仍然倾向于寻找一个同伴来模仿和跟随。肯库人喜欢模仿它所选择的同伴的声音和话语。",
	"If you're playing a kenku, constant attempts to mimic noises can come across as confusing or irritating rather than entertaining. You can just as easily describe the sounds your character makes and what they mean. Be clear about your character's intentions unless you're deliberately aiming for inscrutable or mysterious.": "如果你扮演的是一个Kenku，不断尝试模仿声音会让人感到困惑或恼怒，而不是娱乐。你可以很容易地描述你的角色发出的声音和它们的含义。除非你刻意追求高深莫测或神秘，否则要清楚你的角色的意图。",
	"You might say, \"Snapper makes the noise of a hammer slowly and rhythmically tapping a stone to show how bored he is. He plays with his dagger and studies the Lords' Alliance agent sitting at the bar.\" Creating a vocabulary of noises for the other players to decode might sound like fun, but it can prove distracting and could slow down the game.": "你可能会说，\"斯纳普发出锤子缓慢而有节奏地敲击石头的声音，以显示他有多无聊。他玩着他的匕首，研究坐在酒吧的领主联盟代理人。\" 创造一个噪音词汇让其他玩家解码，听起来可能很有趣，但事实证明会分散注意力，并可能拖慢游戏的进程。",
	"Given that kenku can duplicate any sound, their names are drawn from a staggering variety of noises and phrases. Kenku names tend to break down into three categories that make no distinction between male and female names.": "鉴于Kenku可以复制任何声音，他们的名字来自各种惊人的噪音和短语。Kenku的名字往往分为三类，不分男性和女性名字。",
	"Kenku thugs, warriors, and toughs adopt noises made by weapons, such as the clang of a mace against armor or the sound made by a breaking bone.

	"Kenku thieves, con artists, and burglars adopt animal noises, typically those common in urban settings. In this manner, kenku can call out to each other while those who overhear them mistake them for common animals. Non-kenku use names that refer to the sound made or the animal a kenku mimics, such as Rat Scratch, Whistler, Mouser, and Growler.": "Kenku小偷、骗子和窃贼采用动物的声音，通常是城市环境中常见的声音。通过这种方式，Kenku可以互相呼唤，而那些听到他们的人则误以为他们是普通动物。非Kenku使用的名字是指Kenku模仿的声音或动物，如Rat Scratch, Whistler, Mouser, and Growler。",
	"Some kenku turn their back on crime to pursue legitimate trades. These kenku adopt noises made as part of their craft.

	"Nearly every khenra is born a fraternal or identical twin, and a pair of khenra twins forms an extremely close emotional bond unknown to most other residents of Amonkhet. The death of one twin in training or the trials causes a tremendous shock to the survivor, who typically grows more aggressive and foolhardy in battle. The rare khenra who are born without twins are believed to have killed their siblings in the womb, and are thus viewed as natural-born initiates, sure to achieve a glorified death in the Trial of Zeal.": "几乎每一个肯纳人都是天生的异卵双胞胎或同卵双胞胎，一对肯纳双胞胎形成了一种极其紧密的情感纽带，这是阿蒙凯特的大多数其他居民所不知道的。一对双胞胎在训练或试炼中的死亡对幸存者造成了巨大的冲击，他们在战斗中通常会变得更加积极和愚蠢。罕见的没有双胞胎的Khenra被认为是在子宫内杀死了他们的兄弟姐妹，因此被视为天生的入门者，肯定会在狂热的试验中获得光荣的死亡。",
	"Many khenra believe that they are created in the image of Hazoret, and though they venerate all five gods in the manner of all citizens of Naktamun, they have a special affinity for the teachings and philosophy of the god of zeal.

	"Khenra who focus on hand-to-hand combat often wield the khopesh—a large sickle-bladed sword—as their weapon of choice (treat as a {@item longsword|phb}). Khenra wield these blades with devastating accuracy and power, landing one crushing blow after another in a hail of furious attacks. They favor lightweight armor that doesn't impede their movement, often comparing fighting in organized ranks to wearing a leash that limits their ability to charge, lunge, and roll away from danger. Their natural aggression makes them ideal shock troops, scouts, and skirmishers. And that aggression is even more pronounced in khenra who have already lost their twin, and who sometimes lose any sense of self-preservation as a result.": "专注于徒手搏斗的堪拉人经常挥舞着镰刀--一种大型的镰刀剑--作为他们的首选武器（视为{@item longsword|phb}）。堪拉人以毁灭性的准确度和力量挥舞这些剑，在狂暴的攻击中一次又一次地进行粉碎性打击。他们喜欢不妨碍他们行动的轻量级盔甲，经常把在有组织的队伍中作战比作戴着一条限制他们冲锋、猛冲和滚开危险的皮带。他们天生的攻击性使他们成为理想的冲击部队、侦察兵和小兵。而这种攻击性在已经失去双胞胎的Khenra身上更加明显，他们有时会因此失去任何自我保护的意识。",
	"Khenra who focus on long-range combat prefer hurled weapons—spears and javelins—over bows and slings, and they are known and feared for their deadly accuracy. They carry small cases of {@item javelin|phb|javelins} into combat, and feel ashamed if they reach the end of a battle with any weapons left unthrown. A khenra might ride on a {@item chariot|phb} as a {@item spear|phb} thrower, sometimes augmenting attacks with minor spells of fire magic.": "专注于远程作战的Khenra更喜欢投掷武器--长矛和标枪--而不是弓箭和弹弓，他们因其致命的准确性而闻名和畏惧。他们在战斗中携带小箱的{@item javelin|phb|javelins}武器，如果他们在战斗结束时没有扔掉任何武器，他们会感到羞愧。Khenra可能会骑在(1%)上作为(2%)投掷者，有时会用小的火系魔法来增强攻击。",
	"Many khenra mages specialize in fire spells, creating blades or hails of flame to sear and scorch their foes. Their strategy emphasizes overwhelming initial assaults, in magical emulation of Hazoret's battle frenzy. Others prefer magic that augments their natural speed and strength, bolsters their endurance, or drains strength from their enemies. They work to hone their spells alongside their bodies, incorporating elements of hand-to-hand combat into their spellcasting.": "许多坎拉法师擅长火系法术，创造出火焰之刃或火焰之帆来灼伤和烧毁他们的敌人。他们的策略强调压倒性的初始攻击，在魔法上模仿哈佐雷特的战斗狂热。其他人则更喜欢用魔法增强他们的自然速度和力量，提高他们的耐力，或消耗敌人的力量。他们努力磨练自己的法术和身体，将徒手搏斗的元素融入他们的法术。",
	"Some of the smallest draconic creatures in the multiverse, kobolds display their draconic ancestry in the glint of their scales and in their roars.

	"Whatever their relationship to dragons, kobold scales tend to be rust colored, although the occasional kobold sports scale color more akin to that of a chromatic or a metallic dragon. The roar of a kobold can express a range of emotion: anger, resolve, elation, fear, and more. Regardless of the emotion the kobold expresses, the roar resonates with draconic power.": "不管他们与龙的关系如何，哥布林的鳞片往往是铁锈色的，尽管偶尔有哥布林的鳞片颜色更接近于色龙或金属龙的颜色。哥布林的吼声可以表达一系列的情绪：愤怒、决心、欣喜、恐惧，等等。不管哥布林表达的是什么情绪，它的吼声都能与龙的力量产生共鸣。",
	"Deeply reverent of the land and its sacred sites, the nomadic kor live a spare existence defined by their constant travels. Masters of ropes and hooks, they scale sheer cliffs and cross yawning chasms with such skill and agility that they sometimes seem almost to take flight.": "游牧的科尔人对土地和圣地怀有深深的敬意，他们的生活因不断的旅行而变得清闲。他们是绳索和钩子的大师，以如此娴熟的技巧和敏捷的身手攀登峭壁，穿越巨大的鸿沟，有时几乎要飞起来。",
	"Kor are associated with white mana, and their wizards and clerics employ spells of healing, of banishing the dark, and of protection. Their personalities and ideals also mesh with the characteristics of white mana in their emphasis on an ordered, harmonious community with strong traditions binding its members together.": "科尔族与白法力有关，他们的巫师和牧师使用治疗、驱逐黑暗和保护的法术。他们的个性和理想也与白玛瑙的特征相吻合，他们强调有序、和谐的社区，有强大的传统将其成员联系在一起。",
	"Kor are tall, slender humanoids with light hair and gray, blue-gray, or ivory skin. All kor have slightly pointed ears, and males have short, fleshy barbels on their chins. They paint softly glowing geometric patterns on their faces and bodies, suggestive of the shapes and design of the hedrons that appear across Zendikar. Their clothing tends to leave their arms and shoulders free to facilitate climbing, and they keep most of their gear in pouches and slings at their waists.": "科尔是高大、纤细的人形动物，有浅色的头发和灰色、蓝灰色或象牙色的皮肤。所有科尔人都有略微尖尖的耳朵，男性的下巴上有短而肉质的倒钩。他们在脸上和身上画着柔和的几何图案，让人联想到出现在整个赞迪卡的赫龙的形状和设计。他们的衣服倾向于让他们的手臂和肩膀自由，以方便攀爬，他们把大部分装备放在腰间的小袋和吊索里。",
	"The kor have a nonverbal language of hand signs and gestures that allows communication despite significant distance (particularly when augmented with whirling ropes) or howling winds. They also use this sign language among themselves when they wish to avoid being overheard, giving rise to misguided rumors that they are incapable of speech. When they do speak, they typically use as few words as possible to convey their meaning.": "科尔人有一种由手势和姿态组成的非语言语言，尽管距离很远（特别是在有旋转绳索的情况下）或有呼啸的风，但仍能进行交流。当他们希望避免被人听到时，他们也会在彼此之间使用这种手语，这引起了关于他们不能说话的错误传言。当他们说话时，他们通常用尽可能少的词来表达他们的意思。",
	"The leonin guard the shining lands of Oreskos, a golden plain where even the gods rarely trespass. Prides of these nomadic, lion-like humanoids rarely interact with other peoples, having all they need in their shimmering homeland and knowing the treachery of strangers. Still, some leonin wonder what lies beyond Oreskos's border mountains and seek to test themselves in a wider world.": "狮子人守护着奥雷斯科的闪亮土地，这是一片金色的平原，即使是诸神也很少涉足。这些游牧的、像狮子一样的人种的骄傲很少与其他民族交流，他们在自己闪亮的家园里拥有所有需要的东西，并且知道陌生人的背叛。然而，一些狮子人想知道奥雷斯科边境山脉之外有什么，并试图在一个更广阔的世界中测试自己。",
	"Leonin tend to be tall compared to humans and move with a boldness that suggests their physical might. Tawny fur covers leonin bodies, and some grow thick manes ranging in shades from gold to black. While their hands prove as nimble as those of other humanoids, leonin have retractable feline claws, which they can extend instantly. This, along with their ability to produce bone-shaking roars, gives most leonin an air that readily shifts between regal and fearsome.": "与人类相比，莱昂人往往很高大，而且行动大胆，显示出他们的身体力量。灰褐色的皮毛覆盖着利奥宁人的身体，一些人长出了从金色到黑色的浓密鬃毛。虽然他们的手被证明和其他人类一样灵活，但利安人有可伸缩的猫科动物爪子，他们可以立即伸展。这一点，加上他们能够发出震耳欲聋的吼声，使大多数利安人具有一种在威严和可怕之间轻易转换的气质。",
	"Leonin often act with confidence, which can come off as imperiousness. While this can reassure their allies, it can also suggest defiance in the face of what they perceive as imposed authority or unworthy experts.": "莱昂宁经常表现得很自信，这可能会让人觉得他很无礼。虽然这可以让他们的盟友放心，但也可以暗示在他们认为是强加的权威或不值得的专家面前的蔑视。",
	"Other peoples often perceive leonin as quick to take offense, intolerant of criticism, or belligerent. The truth is that many leonin simply enjoy fighting, whether verbal or physical. They take pleasure in argument, wrestling, sparring, and even battle, enjoying the opportunity to exercise their minds and bodies.": "其他人往往认为雷恩人很快就会冒犯别人，不能容忍批评，或者好战。事实是，许多雷恩人只是喜欢战斗，无论是口头还是身体。他们以争论、摔跤、拼搏，甚至战斗为乐，享受锻炼身心的机会。",
	"It follows, too, that leonin aren't inclined to carry grudges. A warrior might react with sudden violence to an insult, but when the fight is over (and the leonin's superiority proven), the insult is forgotten—along with the vanquished foe.": "这也说明，利安人并不倾向于带着怨恨。一个战士可能会对侮辱做出突然的暴力反应，但当战斗结束时（并且证明了利安人的优势），侮辱就会被遗忘--和被征服的敌人一起。",
	"Few leonin devote themselves to the service of the gods. Centuries ago, the leonin worshiped the same gods that humans do, but after many of their prides suffered depravities at the hands of the tyrant Agnomakhos, most leonin rejected the gods. It's not that they deny the existence of deities; they merely see the gods as mercurial and ultimately unworthy of adoration. The Leonin and the Gods table suggests the range of attitudes that leonin might adopt toward the gods.": "很少有列宁人献身于神灵的服务。几个世纪以前，利安人崇拜的是和人类一样的神，但在他们的许多王族在暴君阿格诺玛科斯手中遭受蹂躏后，大多数利安人拒绝了神灵。这并不是说他们否认神灵的存在；他们只是认为神灵是多变的，最终不值得崇拜。列昂尼德与众神表显示了列昂尼德对众神可能采取的一系列态度。",
	"I'm amused by the antics of the gods and their earnest, but ultimately deluded, mortal champions, and I feel smugly superior in my detachment.": "我被众神和他们认真但最终被蒙蔽的凡人拥护者的滑稽行为所逗乐，我在疏离中感到自鸣得意。",
	"The meddling of the gods in mortal affairs makes me angry and bitter. I wish they would just leave us all alone!": "诸神对凡人事务的干涉让我感到愤怒和痛苦。我希望他们能放过我们!",
	"I view the gods as worthy adversaries—incredibly clever and well-prepared to play a long game but ultimately doomed to lose their games.": "我认为诸神是值得尊敬的对手--令人信服的聪明和精心准备的长期游戏，但最终注定要输掉他们的游戏。",
	"I'm certain every bad thing that happens can ultimately be blamed on the gods, but I roll my eyes at each new twist of fate and try to get on with my life.": "我确信每一件发生的坏事最终都可以归咎于神灵，但我对每一个新的命运转折都翻白眼，并试图继续我的生活。",
	"I wish that I could be as naive as humans and other mortals who actually think the gods are looking out for them. I miss that kind of innocence.": "我希望我能够像人类和其他凡人一样天真，真正认为神灵在照顾他们。我怀念那种纯真的感觉。",
	"I don't talk about it among other leonin, but I actually revere the gods and try to please them by my actions.": "我不在其他列宁中谈论这个问题，但我实际上崇敬神灵，并试图通过我的行动取悦他们。",
	"Along with their personal names, leonin identify themselves by their pride. A member of the Flintclaw pride with the personal name of Ziore, for example, would likely style herself as Ziore of the Flintclaw.": "除了他们的个人名字外，利安人还通过他们的族群来识别自己。例如，一个拥有Ziore个人名字的火爪族成员，可能会将自己的名字定为火爪族的Ziore。",
	"Embereye, Flintclaw, Goldenfield, Ironmane, Starfeller, Sunguides": "恩贝雷，弗林特克洛，金田，铁人，斯达菲勒，太阳女神",
	"The saurian lizardfolk are thought by some sages to be distant cousins of dragonborn and kobolds. Despite their resemblance to those other scaled folk, however, lizardfolk are their own people and have lived on the worlds of the Material Plane since the worlds' creation. Gifted by the gods with remarkable physical defenses and a mystical connection to the natural world, lizardfolk can survive with just their wits in situations that would be deadly for other folk. Because of that fact, many lizardfolk myths state that their people were placed by the gods in the Material Plane to guard its natural wonders.": "一些圣人认为萨乌尔蜥蜴人是龙裔和哥布林的远房表亲。尽管他们与其他鳞片人很相似，然而蜥蜴人是他们自己的民族，自从世界被创造以来就一直生活在物质界的各个世界上。蜥蜴人被诸神赋予了非凡的身体防御能力和与自然界的神秘联系，在对其他民族来说是致命的情况下，他们可以仅凭智慧生存。由于这一事实，许多蜥蜴人的神话都说他们的族人被诸神安置在物质世界中，以保护其自然奇迹。",
	"Lizardfolk have colorful scales and exhibit a wide array of scale patterns. Their individual facial features are as varied as those of lizards.": "蜥蜴人有五颜六色的鳞片，表现出各种各样的鳞片图案。他们各自的面部特征和蜥蜴一样丰富多彩。",
	"Only a fool looks at the lizardfolk and sees nothing more than scaly humanoids. Their physical shape notwithstanding, lizardfolk have more in common with iguanas or dragons than they do with humans, dwarves, or elves. Lizardfolk possess an alien and inscrutable mindset, their desires and thoughts driven by a different set of basic principles than those of warm-blooded creatures. Their dismal swamp homes might lie hundreds of miles from the nearest human settlement, but the gap between their way of thinking and that of the smooth-skins is far greater.": "只有傻瓜才会在看蜥蜴人时只看到有鳞的人形动物。尽管他们的身体形状不同，但蜥蜴人与鬣蜥或龙的共同之处多于与人类、矮人或精灵的共同之处。蜥蜴人拥有一种外来的、难以捉摸的心态，他们的欲望和思想受一套不同于温血动物的基本原则所驱动。他们凄凉的沼泽家园可能离最近的人类定居点有几百英里远，但他们的思维方式与光滑皮肤的思维方式之间的差距要大得多。",
	"Despite their alien outlook, some lizardfolk make an effort to understand and, in their own manner, befriend people of other races. Such lizardfolk make faithful and skilled allies.": "尽管他们有着异样的眼光，一些蜥蜴人还是努力去理解，并以自己的方式与其他种族的人交好。这样的蜥蜴人是忠实的、熟练的盟友。",
	"The lizardfolk's reptilian nature comes through not only in their appearance, but also in how they think and act. Lizardfolk experience a more limited emotional life than other humanoids. Like most reptiles, their feelings largely revolve around fear, aggression, and pleasure.": "蜥蜴人的爬行动物性质不仅体现在他们的外表上，也体现在他们的思维和行为方式上。与其他人类相比，蜥蜴人经历的情感生活更为有限。像大多数爬行动物一样，他们的感情主要围绕着恐惧、攻击和快乐。",
	"Lizardfolk experience most feelings as detached descriptions of creatures and situations. For example, humans confronted by an angry troll experience fear on a basic level. Their limbs shake, their thinking becomes panicked and jumbled, and they react by instinct. The emotion of fear takes hold and controls their actions. In contrast, lizardfolk see emotions as traits assigned to other creatures, objects, and situations. A lizardfolk doesn't think, \"I'm scared.\" Instead, aggressive, stronger creatures register to the lizardfolk as fearsome beings to be avoided if possible. If such creatures attack, lizardfolk flee, fighting only if cornered. Lizardfolk aren't scared of a troll; instead, they understand that a troll is a fearsome, dangerous creature and react accordingly.": "蜥蜴人体验到的大多数感觉是对生物和情况的超然描述。例如，人类在面对愤怒的巨魔时，会在基本层面上体验到恐惧。他们的四肢会颤抖，他们的思维会变得慌乱和混乱，他们的反应是本能的。恐惧的情绪占据并控制着他们的行动。相比之下，蜥蜴人把情绪看作是分配给其他生物、物体和情况的特征。蜥蜴人不会想，\"我很害怕\"。相反，攻击性的、更强大的生物在蜥蜴人看来是可怕的生物，如果可能的话，应该避免。如果这种生物发起攻击，蜥蜴人就会逃跑，只有在被逼到绝境时才会战斗。蜥蜴人并不害怕巨魔；相反，他们明白巨魔是一种可怕的、危险的生物，并作出相应的反应。",
	"Lizardfolk never become angry in the way others do, but they act with aggression toward creatures that they could defeat in a fight and that can't be dealt with in some other manner. They are aggressive toward prey they want to eat, creatures that want to harm them, and so on.": "蜥蜴人从来没有像其他人那样变得愤怒，但他们对那些他们可以在战斗中击败的、无法用其他方式处理的生物采取攻击性行动。他们对他们想吃的猎物、想伤害他们的生物等都有攻击性。",
	"Pleasurable people and things make life easier for lizardfolk. Pleasurable things should be preserved and protected, sometimes at the cost of the lizardfolk's own safety. The most pleasurable creatures and things are ones that allow lizardfolk to assess more situations as benign rather than fearsome.": "愉快的人和事使蜥蜴人的生活更轻松。令人愉快的事物应该被保存和保护，有时甚至以蜥蜴人自己的安全为代价。最令人愉快的生物和事物是那些能让蜥蜴人将更多的情况评估为良性的而不是可怕的。",
	"Most humanoids describe cold-blooded people as lacking in emotion and empathy. The same label serves as an apt depiction of lizardfolk.": "大多数人形生物将冷血的人描述为缺乏情感和同情心。同样的标签也是对蜥蜴人的贴切描述。",
	"Lacking any internal emotional reactions, lizardfolk behave in a distant manner. They don't mourn fallen comrades or rage against their enemies. They simply observe and react as a situation warrants.": "由于缺乏任何内在的情绪反应，蜥蜴人的行为方式很冷漠。他们不哀悼死去的战友，也不怒斥他们的敌人。他们只是观察，并根据情况作出反应。",
	"Lizardfolk lack meaningful emotional ties to the past. They assess situations based on their current and future utility and importance. Nowhere does this come through as strongly as when lizardfolk deal with the dead. To a lizardfolk, a comrade who dies becomes a potential source of food. That companion might have once been a warrior or hunter, but now the body is just freshly killed meat.": "蜥蜴人对过去缺乏有意义的情感纽带。他们根据当前和未来的效用和重要性来评估情况。这一点在蜥蜴人与死者打交道时体现得最为强烈。对蜥蜴人来说，一个死去的同伴会成为潜在的食物来源。这个同伴可能曾经是一个战士或猎人，但现在他的尸体只是新杀的肉。",
	"A lizardfolk who lives among other humanoids can, over time, learn to respect other creatures' emotions. The lizardfolk doesn't share those feelings, but instead assesses them in the same clinical manner. Yes, the fallen dwarf might be most useful as a meal, but hacking the body into steaks provokes aggression in the other humanoids and makes them less helpful in battle.": "生活在其他人类中的蜥蜴人，随着时间的推移，可以学会尊重其他生物的情感。蜥蜴人并不分享这些情感，而是以同样的临床方式评估它们。是的，倒下的矮人可能是最有用的一餐，但把尸体砍成牛排会激起其他人形生物的攻击性，使他们在战斗中的帮助减少。",
	"The lizardfolk mindset might seem unnecessarily cruel, but it helps them survive in a hostile environment. The swamps they inhabit are filled with a staggering variety of threats. Lizardfolk focus on survival above all, without sentiment.": "蜥蜴人的思维方式可能看起来不必要的残忍，但这有助于他们在恶劣的环境中生存。他们居住的沼泽地充满了各种惊人的威胁。蜥蜴人专注于生存至上，没有感情。",
	"Lizardfolk assess everyone and everything in terms of utility. Art and beauty have little meaning for them. A sharp sword serves a useful and good purpose, while a dull sword is a dead weight without a whetstone.": "蜥蜴人从实用性的角度来评估每个人和每件事。艺术和美对他们来说没有什么意义。一把锋利的剑有一个有用的、好的目的，而一把钝的剑没有磨刀石就是一个死物。",
	"Lizardfolk see little need to plan more than a season or so into the future. This approach allows them to maintain their current level of influence in the world, but it limits their growth. Lizardfolk have no interest in developing writing, making long-term plans, or cultivating other methods to progress beyond their simple existence as hunters and gatherers.": "蜥蜴人认为没有必要对未来进行超过一个季度的规划。这种方法使他们能够保持他们在这个世界上的现有影响水平，但它限制了他们的成长。蜥蜴人对发展写作、制定长期计划或培养其他方法来超越他们作为猎人和采集者的简单存在毫无兴趣。",
	"At their core, lizardfolk view other humanoids with an indifference verging on pity. Born into the world lacking stout scales and sharp teeth, it's a wonder they have managed to survive for so long. The typical human would barely make it through a day in the swamps.": "在他们的核心，蜥蜴人以一种近乎怜悯的冷漠来看待其他人类。出生在这个世界上的蜥蜴人缺乏坚固的鳞片和锋利的牙齿，他们能够生存这么久，真是个奇迹。典型的人类在沼泽地里几乎无法度过一天。",
	"Still, if other creatures prove useful to lizardfolk, those creatures can trigger a protective response made all the stronger by their apparent weakness. The lizardfolk assess such beings as hatchlings, young ones incapable of protecting themselves but who might prove useful in the future if they receive care.": "不过，如果其他生物被证明对蜥蜴人有用，这些生物可以触发一种保护性的反应，因为它们明显的弱点而变得更加强大。蜥蜴人将这些生物视为幼崽，这些幼崽没有能力保护自己，但如果他们得到照顾，可能会在未来证明是有用的。",
	"You can use the Lizardfolk Quirks table to determine a personality quirk for a lizardfolk character or to inspire a unique mannerism.": "你可以使用蜥蜴人怪癖表来确定蜥蜴人角色的个性怪癖，或者激发出独特的举止。",
	"You hate waste and see no reason not to scavenge fallen enemies. Fingers are tasty and portable!": "你讨厌浪费，认为没有理由不搜刮掉落的敌人。手指是美味的，而且便于携带!",

	"You enjoy eating your food while it's still wriggling.": "你喜欢在食物还在蠕动的时候吃它。",
	"Lizardfolk can master Common, but their mindset results in a speech pattern distinct from other humanoids.": "蜥蜴人可以掌握普通话，但他们的思维方式导致他们的语言模式与其他人类不同。",
	"Lizardfolk rarely use metaphors. Their speech is almost always literal. They might pick up idioms, but only with some difficulty.": "蜥蜴人很少使用比喻。他们的讲话几乎都是字面意思。他们可能会掌握成语，但只是有些困难。",
	"Names confuse them, unless they are descriptive. They tend to apply their own naming conventions to other creatures using Common words.": "名字让他们感到困惑，除非它们是描述性的。他们倾向于将自己的命名规则应用于其他生物，使用普通词汇。",
	"Lizardfolk use active verbs to describe the world. A lizardfolk in cold weather might say, \"This wind brings cold\" rather than \"I feel cold.\" Lizardfolk tend to define things in terms of actions, rather than effects.": "蜥蜴人使用主动动词来描述世界。在寒冷的天气里，蜥蜴人可能会说，\"这风带来了寒冷\"，而不是 \"我感到寒冷\"。蜥蜴人倾向于用行动来定义事物，而不是效果。",
	"Lizardfolk take their names from the Draconic language. They use simple descriptives granted by the tribe based on an individual's notable deeds or actions. For example, Garurt translates as \"axe,\" a name given to a lizardfolk warrior who defeated an orc and claimed his foe's weapon. A lizardfolk who likes to hide in a stand of reeds before ambushing an animal might be called Achuak, which means \"green\" to describe how she blends into the foliage.": "蜥蜴人的名字来自于德拉克斯语。他们使用部落根据个人的显著事迹或行动而授予的简单描述。例如，加鲁特（Garurt）被翻译成 \"斧头\"，这个名字是给一个打败兽人并夺取敌人武器的蜥蜴人战士的。一个喜欢在伏击动物前躲在芦苇丛中的蜥蜴人可能被称为Achuak，意思是 \"绿色\"，以描述她如何融入树叶中。",

	"The humanoid elephants called loxodons are often oases of calm in the busy streets of Ravnica. They hum or chant in sonorous tones and move slowly or sit in perfect stillness. If provoked to action, loxodons are true terrors—bellowing with rage, trumpeting and flapping their ears. Their serene wisdom, fierce loyalty, and unwavering conviction are tremendous assets to their guilds.": "被称为Loxodons的人形大象常常是拉夫尼卡繁忙街道上的平静绿洲。它们用铿锵有力的语调哼唱或吟唱，缓慢地移动或静静地坐着。如果被激怒了，loxodons是真正的恐怖--怒吼着，吹着喇叭，拍着耳朵。他们宁静的智慧、强烈的忠诚和坚定的信念是他们行会的巨大财富。",
	"Loxodons tower above most other humanoids, standing over 7 feet tall. They have the heads—trunks, tusks, ears, and faces—of elephants, and hulking bipedal bodies covered by thick, leathery skin. Each of their hands has four thick digits, and their feet are the flat-bottomed, oval-shaped feet of elephants.": "狐獴比其他大多数人形动物高大，身高超过7英尺。它们有大象的头--躯干、獠牙、耳朵和脸，以及由厚实的皮革皮肤覆盖的庞大的双足身体。他们的每只手都有四个粗大的指头，他们的脚是大象的平底、椭圆形的脚。",
	"Like that of an elephant, a loxodon's trunk is a useful appendage. In addition to providing a keen sense of smell, the trunk can be used to lift and carry even heavy objects. The trunk can be used to carry both food and liquid to the mouth and can even act as a snorkel.": "和大象一样，狐狸的躯干是一个有用的附属物。除了提供敏锐的嗅觉外，树干还可以用来举起和搬运甚至是重物。躯干可以用来把食物和液体送到嘴里，甚至可以充当呼吸管。",

	"Loxodons believe that the members of a group have a responsibility to look out for each other. Once they have joined a guild or bonded with other individuals in any capacity, loxodons devote themselves to maintaining that bond. They coordinate their efforts and are often willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the group. They expect reciprocal loyalty and commitment from the other members of their communities and can be severe in their disappointment when their trust is betrayed.": "Loxodons认为，一个团体的成员有责任互相照顾。一旦他们加入了一个行会或以任何身份与其他个人结合，loxodons就会致力于维持这种联系。他们协调自己的努力，并经常愿意为了群体的利益而牺牲自己。他们期望从他们社区的其他成员那里得到对等的忠诚和承诺，当他们的信任被背叛时，他们会感到严重的失望。",
	"The primary difference between loxodons who join different guilds is their sense of the size of the community they belong to. For loxodons in the Selesnya Conclave, their community is the world and all living beings in it—everything valuable, meant to live in harmony, and interdependent. For Azorius loxodons, community primarily means a society of different peoples who need adherence to law and order so they can function together. For those in the Orzhov Syndicate, community means the syndicate alone, with its interests taking priority over those of any other group.": "加入不同行会的loxodons之间的主要区别是他们对自己所属社区的规模的感觉。对于Selesnya公会的loxodons来说，他们的社区是世界和其中的所有生物--所有有价值的东西，意味着和谐共处，并且相互依存。对于Azorius loxodons来说，社区主要意味着一个由不同民族组成的社会，他们需要遵守法律和秩序，以便他们能够共同运作。对于奥尔佐夫集团的人来说，社区意味着只有集团，其利益优先于任何其他团体的利益。",
	"A loxodon's name includes subtle tones, produced in a loxodon's resonant nasal chambers, that indicate status, family connection, and community role.

Among the Selesnya, it primarily falls to them to build the guild's magnificent cathedral-like arboretum structures.": "Loxodons是不知疲倦、有耐心的工匠，对他们的手艺有着无与伦比的直觉。虽然他们是培养人的精神领袖，但他们在石匠方面的天赋是如此自然，以至于当他们向他人传授知识时，往往无所适从。在塞勒斯尼亚人中，他们主要负责建造公会宏伟的大教堂式树木园结构。",
	"Loxodons believe in the value of community and life, and thus are most often found in the Selesnya Conclave. Some who stress the benefits of order have been known to join the Orzhov Syndicate or the Azorius Senate.": "Loxodons相信社区和生活的价值，因此最常出现在Selesnya Conclave。一些强调秩序好处的人被称为加入了奥尔佐夫集团或阿佐里乌斯参议院。",
	"Loxodons believe that the members of a group have a responsibility to look out for each other. Once they have joined a guild or bonded with other individuals in any capacity, they devote themselves to maintaining that bond. They coordinate their efforts and are often willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the group. They expect the same loyalty and commitment from the other members of their communities and can be severe in their disappointment when their trust is betrayed.": "Loxodons认为，一个团体的成员有责任互相照顾。一旦他们加入一个行会或以任何身份与其他个人结合，他们就会致力于维持这种联系。他们协调自己的努力，并经常愿意为团体的利益而牺牲自己。他们期望自己社区的其他成员也有同样的忠诚和承诺，当他们的信任被背叛时，他们的失望情绪会很严重。",
	"The primary difference among loxodons who join different guilds is their sense of the size of the communities they belong to. For loxodons in the Selesnya Conclave, the community is the world and all living beings in it, all valuable, all meant to live in harmony, and all interdependent. For Azorius loxodons, community primarily means the society of sentient races, who need law and order in order to function together. For those in the Orzhov Syndicate, community means the syndicate, with its interests taking priority over those of any other group.": "加入不同行会的loxodons之间的主要区别是他们对自己所属的社区规模的感觉。对于Selesnya公会的loxodons来说，社区是指世界和其中的所有生物，都是有价值的，都是要和谐相处的，都是相互依赖的。对于Azorius loxodons来说，社区主要意味着有生命的种族的社会，他们需要法律和秩序，以便共同运作。对于奥尔佐夫集团的人来说，社区意味着集团，其利益优先于任何其他团体的利益。",
	"A loxodon's name includes overtones of sound, produced in a loxodon's resonant nasal chambers, that indicate status, family connection, and community role. Since most members of other races can't hear or distinguish these tones, let alone produce them, loxodons often translate them into titles, such as Hierarch, Revered, Grandmother, Healer, or Saint.": "一个loxodon的名字包括泛音，由loxodon的共鸣鼻腔产生，表示地位、家庭关系和社区角色。由于其他种族的大多数成员无法听到或区分这些音调，更不用说产生这些音调了，所以狐狸精经常把它们翻译成头衔，如酋长、尊敬的、祖母、治疗师或圣人。",
	"Curious, thoughtful, and analytical, the merfolk of Zendikar are natural scholars and explorers. In the past, merfolk society was organized around their belief in three deities. But in the wake of the reappearance of the Eldrazi, the merfolk have realized that their faith was a web of lies, built on a corrupted memory of the Eldrazi titans handed down from generation to generation. In peaceful times, the merfolk might have fought over the ultimate meaning of this revelation. But faced with the danger presented by the Eldrazi broods, the merfolk have largely set aside their differences and joined together in a united force. Old grudges still linger, but the well-being of the merfolk race—and the world—far outweigh any ancient conflicts between creeds.": "好奇心强、善于思考、善于分析，赞迪卡的人鱼族是天然的学者和探险家。在过去，人鱼族的社会是围绕着他们对三个神灵的信仰而组织的。但在埃尔德拉兹重新出现后，人鱼族意识到他们的信仰是一张谎言之网，建立在代代相传的关于埃尔德拉兹巨人的腐朽记忆之上。在和平时期，人鱼族可能会为这个启示的最终意义而争斗。但面对埃尔德拉兹巨兽带来的危险，人鱼族在很大程度上搁置了他们的分歧，并联合起来形成了一个统一的力量。旧的怨恨仍然存在，但人鱼族和世界的福祉远远超过了任何古老的信仰之间的冲突。",

	"Merfolk are an amphibious race, born and at home in the water but comfortable on dry land. Humanoid in form, they have skin of ivory, silver, russet, blue, or deep purple. Long fins extend from the backs of their forearms and calves, and their fingers and toes are webbed. The hairlike growths on their heads are either thick and bristly like the needles of a sea urchin, or long and wavy, resembling fine seaweed. In either case, these growths typically range in color from red to warm brown to black. Male merfolk have similar growths extending down from their cheekbones.": "人鱼族是一个水陆两栖的种族，在水里出生并在家里，但在干地上也很舒服。他们拥有象牙色、银色、赤褐色、蓝色或深紫色的皮肤，呈人形。长长的鳍从他们的前臂和小腿的后面延伸出来，他们的手指和脚趾都有蹼。它们头上的毛发有的像海胆的针一样粗壮，有的像波浪一样长，类似于细海藻。在这两种情况下，这些生长物的颜色通常从红色到暖棕色到黑色不等。男性人鱼族有类似的生长，从他们的颧骨向下延伸。",
	"Merfolk wear little clothing unless they are armored for battle. Even then, they drape themselves with nets and a minimum of cloth, wearing armor crafted of large, bleached seashells and augmented with leather.": "美人鱼几乎不穿衣服，除非他们为战斗而穿上铠甲。即使如此，他们也用网和最低限度的布把自己包裹起来，穿上由大型漂白的贝壳制作的盔甲，并以皮革加固。",
	"No merfolk will openly admit to following the creed of the trickster, but those who do view Cosi as an ally who can grant them control over the chaotic forces of the world.": "没有人鱼会公开承认追随捣蛋鬼的信条，但那些人将科西视为能够赋予他们控制世界混乱力量的盟友。",
	"Merfolk who followed Emeria's creed seek wisdom and truth in the Wind Realm, exploring the mystical forces—rather than natural causes—behind historical events. They are evasive and intentionally enigmatic in their interactions with others, and are often described as manipulative and deceptive.": "遵循埃默里亚信条的人鱼族在风界寻求智慧和真理，探索历史事件背后的神秘力量，而不是自然原因。他们在与他人的互动中闪烁其词，故意让人捉摸不透，并且经常被描述为具有操纵性和欺骗性。",

	"Minotaurs are barrel-chested humanoids with heads resembling those of bulls. Their horns range in size from about 1 foot long to great, curling weapons easily three times that length. They often ornament their horns with metal rings or sheathe them in metal to protect them from damage.": "牛头人是桶状胸的人形生物，头部类似于公牛的头部。他们的角的大小从大约1英尺长到很大，卷曲的武器很容易达到3倍的长度。他们经常用金属环来装饰他们的角，或者用金属鞘来保护他们免受损害。",
	"Manes of shaggy fur extend down minotaurs' necks and powerful backs, and males have long tufts of hair on their chins and cheeks. Their legs end in heavy, cloven hooves.

	"Minotaurs are zealous and love battle. They are found among the Gruul Clans, but the minotaurs of the Ordruun family line, long associated with the Boros Legion, are much better known and respected. Boros minotaurs choose the precision of the legion over the fury of the pack.": "牛头人热情洋溢，热爱战斗。他们在格鲁尔氏族中被发现，但奥德鲁恩家系的牛头人，长期与波罗斯军团有联系，更出名，更受尊重。婆罗洲牛头人选择军团的精确性，而不是族群的狂暴。",

	"Minotaur legends describe a small pantheon of heroes—perhaps they were once thought of as gods—who established the minotaurs' place in the world. Every minotaur in Ravnica claims descent from one of these heroes. The Ordruun line is the most prominent, with thousands of members descended from an ancient hero who is said to have taught minotaurs the arts of war. Other important family lines include the Kharran line (primarily associated with the Gruul Scab clan), the Drendaa line (found scattered among the Gruul Clans), and the Tazgral line (divided between the Boros and the Gruul, with a significant number in the Rakdos as well).": "牛头人的传说描述了一个小型的英雄万神殿--也许他们曾经被认为是神，他们确立了牛头人在世界中的地位。拉夫尼卡的每个牛头人都声称自己是这些英雄之一的后裔。奥德鲁恩（Ordruun）家族是最突出的，有数千名成员是一位古代英雄的后裔，据说他曾教导牛头人战争的艺术。其他重要的家系包括卡兰（Kharran）家系（主要与格鲁尔-斯卡布氏族有关），德伦达（Drendaa）家系（分散在格鲁尔氏族中），以及塔兹格拉尔（Tazgral）家系（分属波罗斯和格鲁尔，在拉克多斯也有相当数量）。",
	"Since each family line has so many members, minotaurs don't usually find it helpful to connect the name of the line to their personal names; even though Commander Grozdan of the Boros Legion's Kamen Fortress is a prominent member of the Ordruun line, he would never call himself Grozdan Ordruun the way a human would.": "由于每个家系都有很多成员，牛头人通常认为将家系的名字与他们的个人名字联系起来是没有用的；即使波罗斯军团卡门堡垒的指挥官格罗兹丹是奥德鲁恩家系的杰出成员，他也不会像人类那样自称格罗兹丹-奥德鲁恩。",
	"The legends that recount the deeds of ancient minotaur heroes are full of other names as well: those of the retainers, allies, lovers, servants, enemies, and others who played roles, however small, in the lives of the heroes. Almost every minotaur name is drawn from that long list of minor characters of legend, so that those folk are never forgotten.": "叙述古代牛头人英雄事迹的传说中也充满了其他的名字：那些在英雄生活中扮演角色的家臣、盟友、恋人、仆人、敌人和其他人的名字，无论多么微小。几乎每一个牛头人的名字都是从那一长串的传说中的小人物中提取的，所以这些人永远不会被遗忘。",
	"The minotaurs who dwell in the badlands of Phoberos and the remote polis of Skophos are caught between two worlds. Some follow the dark god Mogis, who has tyrannized them for ages untold and shown them a trail of slaughter that is all many minotaurs have ever known. Others, though, have emerged from this bloody path and found a world that welcomes those who pursue their own destinies and heroic callings.": "居住在Phoberos坏境和Skophos偏远地区的牛头人被夹在两个世界之间。一些人追随黑暗之神Mogis，Mogis暴虐了他们不知多少年，并向他们展示了许多牛头人所知道的屠杀足迹。然而，其他人已经从这条血腥的道路上走了出来，并找到了一个欢迎那些追求自己的命运和英雄的召唤的世界。",
	"Minotaurs are barrel-chested humanoids with heads resembling those of bulls. Their horns range in size from about 1 foot long to great, curling weapons easily three times that length. Theros minotaurs often carve their horns to sharpen their edges, etch symbols of power into them, or sheathe them in bronze to prevent them from shattering during battle.": "牛头人是桶状胸的人形生物，头部类似于公牛的头部。他们的角的大小从大约1英尺长到巨大的，卷曲的武器很容易达到3倍的长度。泰罗斯牛头人经常雕刻他们的牛角，使其边缘更加锋利，在牛角上刻上力量的符号，或将牛角套在青铜器里，以防止它们在战斗中破碎。",
	"Thick hair extends down minotaurs' necks and powerful backs, and some have long patches of hair on their chins and cheeks. Their legs end in heavy, cloven hooves, and they have long, tufted tails. Minotaur priests often adorn themselves with sacred items, be they trophies from fallen foes, keepsakes from their homeland, or naturally occurring marks of their god's favor.": "浓密的毛发沿着牛头人的脖子和强大的背部延伸，有些人的下巴和脸颊上有长长的毛发。他们的腿末端是沉重的蹄子，他们有长长的、丛生的尾巴。牛头人祭司经常用神圣的物品来装饰自己，无论是从堕落的敌人那里得到的战利品，还是从他们的家乡得到的纪念品，或者是自然形成的神的青睐的标志。",
	"Although minotaurs aren't evil by nature and are free to worship any god, many are raised among those devoted to Mogis's vile whims. Myths tell that Mogis created the first minotaurs from his own followers, typically criminals and monsters of unspeakable depravity. While many groups of minotaurs still honor their villainous progenitors, others have abandoned their ancestors and moved beyond their crimes, seeking their fates in the future, not the past.": "虽然牛头人本质上并不邪恶，而且可以自由地崇拜任何神，但许多牛头人是在那些致力于莫吉斯的卑鄙想法的人中长大的。神话中说，莫吉斯从他自己的追随者中创造了第一批牛头人，这些人通常是罪犯和无法形容的堕落的怪物。虽然许多牛头人群体仍然尊重他们邪恶的祖先，但其他人已经抛弃了他们的祖先，超越了他们的罪行，在未来而不是过去寻求他们的命运。",
	"Minotaurs are known for venting their outrage through violence, but they aren't generally quick to anger. They are passionate, loving their friends and partners fiercely, and they laugh loud and long at good jokes. This zeal also extends to their faith. Those who have avoided the corrupting influence of Mogis gravitate toward the service of gods who share their bold nature, especially Erebos, Keranos, and Purphoros. Those who have rejected Mogis sometimes embrace his hated twin brother, Iroas.": "牛头人以通过暴力发泄愤怒而闻名，但他们一般不会轻易发怒。他们很热情，猛烈地爱着他们的朋友和伙伴，他们会因为好的笑话而大声地笑很久。这种热情也延伸到了他们的信仰。那些避免了莫吉斯的腐蚀影响的人倾向于为那些与他们有同样大胆天性的神灵服务，特别是埃里伯斯、凯拉诺斯和珀弗洛斯。那些拒绝莫吉斯的人有时会拥护他可恨的孪生兄弟伊罗亚斯。",
	"In the labyrinthine polis of Skophos, the deeds of minotaur champions are carved among the winding halls. Minotaurs often name their children after these great heroes, believing that a child will inherit the strength, audacity, guile, or fearsomeness of a heroic namesake. Other minotaur parents invent their own names, though, believing in their child's potential to light a new constellation in Nyx with the brightness of their own soul.": "在斯科福斯迷宫般的政体中，牛头人冠军的事迹被刻在蜿蜒的大厅中。牛头人常常以这些伟大的英雄的名字为他们的孩子命名，相信孩子会继承英雄名字的力量、胆量、狡诈或可怕。然而，其他牛头人父母也会发明自己的名字，相信他们的孩子有可能用自己的灵魂之光照亮尼克斯的新星座。",

Your character might strive to emulate that quality or seek to forge a new legacy to be associated with your name by future generations.": "牛头人的名字表显示了牛头人的名字可能具有的品质或事迹。你的角色可能会努力效仿这种品质，或者寻求创造一种新的遗产，让你的名字与后世联系起来。",
	"Myth of Mogis and the Minotaurs": "莫吉斯和牛头人的神话",
	"Some legends claim that Mogis created the minotaurs, transforming his most bloodthirsty followers so that their hulking bodies resembled his own. However, while the tales told in the labyrinth-polis of Skophos affirm that Mogis rewarded his most devoted followers, they assert that these followers were already minotaurs, and all Mogis did was exalt them to an honored status. Among minotaurs who worship Mogis, these heroes are revered as spiritual if not literal ancestors. The moral of this story is simply that Mogis is a god who rewards his faithful servants.": "一些传说声称莫吉斯创造了牛头人，改造了他最嗜血的追随者，使他们巨大的身体与他自己的身体相像。然而，虽然在斯科福斯的迷宫城市中讲述的故事肯定了莫吉斯奖励了他最忠实的追随者，但他们断言这些追随者本来就是牛头人，而莫吉斯所做的只是将他们提升到一个尊贵的地位。在崇拜Mogis的牛头人中，这些英雄被尊为精神上的祖先，即使不是字面上的。这个故事的寓意很简单，莫吉斯是一个奖励其忠实仆人的神。",
	"Minotaurs who don't follow Mogis are quick to point out that this myth says nothing about the nature of minotaurs. The worship of Mogis, they argue, is no more inherent to them than it is to humans, and minotaurs aren't destined to a life of slaughter because of the circumstances of their creation. Perhaps most importantly, minotaurs aren't an offshoot of humanity but a people in their own right, and neither their nature nor their destiny is tied to a single god.": "不追随Mogis的牛头人很快就指出，这个神话没有说明牛头人的本质。他们认为，对Mogis的崇拜并不像对人类那样是与生俱来的，而且牛头人并不因为他们被创造的环境而注定要过着被屠杀的生活。也许最重要的是，牛头人不是人类的分支，而是有自己权利的民族，他们的本性和命运都不与一个神联系在一起。",

They revel in combat, especially when the odds against them seem overwhelming.": "牛头人是身材强壮的桶形胸膛的人形动物，头部类似于公羊。他们的角紧紧地蜷缩在头的两侧，环绕着他们的耳朵，蓬松的毛发落在他们宽阔的肩膀上，雌性的毛发更短。正如他们的外表所表明的那样，他们将体力与固执、勇敢和不计后果的勇敢结合起来。他们陶醉于战斗，特别是在对他们来说似乎是压倒性的机会时。",
	"Minotaurs are rowdy, boisterous, and direct to the point of rudeness. They have no qualms about declaring what they want and defying others to keep it from them. In combat, they bellow loud challenges in defiance of their foes, and roar with laughter as they triumph.": "牛头人暴躁、喧闹，直接到了无礼的地步。他们毫无顾忌地宣布他们想要的东西，并藐视别人不让他们得到。在战斗中，他们大声挑战，藐视他们的敌人，并在胜利时大笑着咆哮。",
	"Minotaurs believe they hold a unique place among the races of Amonkhet. The {@race khenra|psa} can look to Hazoret, the {@race naga|psa} to Rhonas, and the {@race aven|psa} to Kefnet to see themselves represented among the gods. Humans have no single god to look to, which explains why they demonstrate such variety. But only one god bears a pair of curving horns: the God-Pharaoh himself, who holds a special place for many of the minotaurs of Amonkhet.": "牛头人相信他们在阿蒙凯特的种族中拥有独特的地位。{@race khenra|psa}可以从哈佐雷特(Hazoret)、{@race naga|psa}从罗纳斯(Rhonas)、{@race aven|psa}从凯菲特(Kefnet)中看到自己在众神中的地位。人类没有单一的神可供仰望，这就解释了为什么他们表现出如此的多样性。但只有一个神有一对弯曲的角：神-法老本人，他对阿蒙凯特的许多牛头人有特殊的地位。",
	"Even those minotaurs who feel personal affinity for the horned God-Pharaoh align themselves most closely with Bontu and Hazoret in practice. Driven by a fierce and powerful desire to prove themselves, to earn glory in life, and to win a glorious death, they view every challenge or obstacle as a chance to demonstrate their prowess. With ruthless abandon, they slash, batter, and pummel their way through anyone or anything that stands in the way of their own advancement. With reckless fervor, they fight without heed for their own safety, shrugging off the blows of their enemies.": "即使是那些对有角的神--法老感到个人亲和力的牛头人，在实践中也与邦图和哈佐雷特最为接近。在激烈而强大的欲望的驱使下，他们想证明自己，想在生活中赢得荣耀，想赢得光荣的死亡，他们把每一个挑战或障碍都视为展示自己能力的机会。他们带着无情的放弃，以砍伐、殴打和重击的方式穿过任何阻碍他们前进的人或物。他们带着鲁莽的狂热，不顾自己的安全而战斗，甩掉敌人的打击。",
	"Their size and strength makes minotaurs ideally suited for hand-to-hand combat. They are most effective on the offensive, delivering an endless barrage of attacks that keep their foes off balance, shatter shields and weapons, and inevitably break their opponents. These minotaurs favor large, heavy weapons such as axes, {@item maul|phb|mauls}, and two-handed khopeshes (treat as a {@item greatsword|phb}), but they are also fond of unarmed combat. Many love to throw their weapons aside in favor of pummeling opponents into submission with their horns and bare hands, believing that such a victory is more glorious—and more humiliating to the loser.": "他们的体型和力量使牛头人非常适合于徒手搏斗。他们在进攻中最为有效，提供无尽的攻击，使他们的敌人失去平衡，粉碎盾牌和武器，并不可避免地打破他们的对手。这些牛头人喜欢大型重型武器，如斧头、{@item maul|phb|mauls}和双手剑(视作{@item greatsword|phb})，但他们也喜欢徒手搏斗。许多人喜欢把武器扔在一边，而用他们的角和赤手空拳把对手打得服服帖帖，他们认为这样的胜利更光荣--而且对失败者来说也更丢脸。",
	"But though minotaurs are known for their physical size and strength, this hardly precludes the presence of keen minds and powerful spellcasters among them. Though they are fewer in number than hand-to-hand specialists, minotaur mages draw on their natural ferocity to instill terror in the hearts of their opponents with a terrible roaring bellow. They manifest their fury as blasts of flame, or imbue their own horns and fists with searing heat to make their physical attacks more deadly.": "尽管牛头人以其体型和力量著称，但这并不妨碍他们中存在敏锐的头脑和强大的法术师。尽管牛头人法师的数量比徒手搏斗的专家少，但他们利用自己天生的凶猛，以可怕的咆哮声在对手心中灌输恐怖。他们将自己的愤怒表现为火焰喷射，或将自己的角和拳头注入灼热的温度，使他们的物理攻击更加致命。",
	"The relatively few minotaurs who specialize in long-range combat enjoy one aspect of that style in particular—the opportunity to draw first blood, marking the moment when a battle has truly begun.

	"Naga resemble enormous snakes with shoulders, arms, and a torso that resembles a humanoid form. They typically hold their heads and torsos off the ground while moving, but they can increase their speed by lowering their bodies and using their hands for extra propulsion. They adorn their torsos with armor, jewelry, and a vague nod toward the clothing worn by other races. Male naga have broad hoods, wider than their shoulders, while females have narrower hoods and longer faces.": "娜迦类似于巨大的蛇，有肩膀、手臂和类似人形的躯干。他们在移动时通常将头和躯干离地，但他们可以通过降低身体和使用双手来增加速度。他们用盔甲、珠宝和其他种族穿的衣服来装饰自己的躯干，并含糊地点头。雄性娜迦有宽大的头罩，比他们的肩膀还宽，而雌性娜迦的头罩较窄，脸较长。",
	"Naga believe in a principle called the Sweetest Harmony, which describes a perfect balance between the body and the mind. Finding that balance, as they understand it, is a sure path to glory in the trials, since a combination of physical and mental preparation will ensure success in every trial. For an example of this Sweetest Harmony, they point to the Luxa river and the land it nourishes, which exist in a delicate and life-giving balance. Either one without the other would be diminished and useless. Just so, mental strength supports physical capabilities, and physical fortitude feeds mental tenacity, so neither mind nor body can exist in isolation.": "娜迦相信一个叫做 \"最甜蜜的和谐 \"的原则，它描述了身体和心灵之间的完美平衡。按照他们的理解，找到这种平衡是在试验中获得荣耀的必经之路，因为身体和心理准备的结合将确保在每一次试验中取得成功。对于这种最甜蜜的和谐的例子，他们指出卢克萨河和它所滋养的土地，它们存在于一种微妙的、赋予生命的平衡中。任何一方离开了另一方，都会变得渺小和无用。就像这样，精神力量支持身体能力，身体的坚韧支持精神的坚韧，所以身心都不能孤立地存在。",
	"In the same way, the naga believe that Kefnet and Rhonas exist in interdependence, and that their trials are best conceived as two halves of a whole. But in practice, as much as they strive for balance and harmony, most naga identify more strongly with one god than the other.": "同样，纳迦人相信凯夫奈特和罗纳斯是相互依存的，他们的考验最好被视为一个整体的两个部分。但实际上，尽管他们努力追求平衡与和谐，大多数纳迦人对一个神的认同比另一个神更强烈。",
	"To the benefit of those naga who struggle with the ideal of the Sweetest Harmony, the training of acolytes encourages specialization. Thus, naga who follow in the path of the snake-headed god Rhonas can cultivate their physical strength as they specialize in hand-to-hand combat styles, while other naga favor the teachings of Kefnet and other combat styles.": "为了让那些为 \"最甜蜜的和谐 \"理想而奋斗的纳迦人受益，对信徒的训练鼓励专业化。因此，追随蛇头神罗纳斯的娜迦可以培养他们的体力，因为他们擅长徒手搏斗的风格，而其他娜迦则喜欢凯夫奈特的教义和其他战斗风格。",
	"Naga who specialize in hand-to-hand combat rely on axes, {@item dagger|phb|daggers}, and {@item shortsword|phb|shortswords}—but also on their own fangs and the constricting strength of their serpentine bodies. They make extensive use of poison, coating their weapons with multiple layers of deadly substances—including, but by no means limited to, their own venom.

	"Plasmoids don't have internal organs of the usual sort. Their bodies are composed of cells, fibers, plasma-like ooze, and clusters of nerves called ganglia. These nerves enable a plasmoid to detect light, heat, texture, sound, pain, and vibrations.

	"Satyrs have a well-earned reputation for their good spirits, gregarious personalities, and love of revels. Most satyrs are driven by simple desires, to see the world and to sample its every pleasure. While their spontaneity and whimsy sometimes put them at odds with more stoic peoples, satyrs rarely let the moodiness of others hinder their own happiness. Life is a blessing from the gods, after all, and the proper response to such a gift, as far as most satyrs are concerned, is to accept it with relish.": "萨提尔因其良好的精神状态、活泼的个性和对狂欢的热爱而获得良好的声誉。大多数萨特人的欲望很简单，就是想看看这个世界，品尝它的每一种乐趣。虽然他们的自发性和奇思妙想有时会使他们与更多的人产生矛盾，但萨提尔人很少让别人的喜怒无常阻碍自己的幸福。毕竟，生命是众神的祝福，对这样的礼物的正确反应，就大多数萨提尔而言，是津津有味地接受它。",
	"In their physical forms, satyrs embody a fusion of humanoid civilization with the freedom of wild beasts. Generally, they look similar to humans, with a range of builds and features. But their goatlike horns, pointed ears, and furred lower bodies sharply distinguish them. Satyrs' solid horns connect to their heads at the base of their skulls, while their legs end in sturdy hooves. Thick fur covers their bodies from the waist down, shorter at the waist and longer below the knees. Short, soft hair grows down their neck and spine, along their shoulders, and on their forearms.": "萨提尔的身体形态体现了人形文明与野兽自由的融合。一般来说，他们看起来与人类相似，有一系列的身材和特征。但他们的山羊角、尖耳朵和毛茸茸的下半身使他们与众不同。萨特人的实心角在头骨的底部与他们的头部相连，而他们的腿则以结实的蹄子为终点。厚厚的皮毛从腰部以下覆盖着他们的身体，腰部较短，膝盖以下较长。短而柔软的毛发顺着他们的脖子和脊柱，沿着他们的肩膀和前臂生长。",
	"The humans of the poleis generally think of satyrs' revels as raucous bacchanals, where anything and everything might happen. This picture isn't wrong, but it's incomplete: there's more to a revel than debauchery. For satyrs, revelry is a way of life. It's the delight in small things: the song of a bird, a warm breeze, the smell of a tasty pie, relaxing by a river in the sunshine. Life freely offers these gifts, and for a satyr, they are more valuable than gold or glory. To revel means to forget the constraints of time, to let go of the future and past, and to be wholly in the present moment. For satyrs, encountering life with all the senses honors the gods, and—most importantly—it feels really good. Driven by instinct and intuition, most satyrs prove unpredictable, following their sense of wonder wherever it leads.": "Poleis的人类通常认为萨提尔的狂欢是喧闹的狂欢，在那里什么都可能发生。这种想象并没有错，但它并不完整：狂欢不仅仅是放荡不羁。对萨提尔来说，狂欢是一种生活方式。它是小事中的快乐：鸟儿的歌声，温暖的微风，美味的馅饼的味道，在阳光下的河边放松。生活自由地提供这些礼物，对萨提尔来说，它们比黄金或荣耀更有价值。狂欢意味着忘记时间的限制，放下未来和过去，完全处于当下。对萨提尔来说，用所有的感官接触生活，是对神灵的尊重，而且最重要的是，它的感觉真的很好。在本能和直觉的驱使下，大多数萨提亚人被证明是不可预测的，无论他们的惊奇感指向何处，他们都会跟随。",
	"Satyrs are known for their eccentricities. Some people spend too much time worrying over why satyrs behave as they do. But satyrs themselves simply are as they are, feeling no need to understand what drives them, much less explain it to others. The Satyr Eccentricities table suggests a few tastes or proclivities your satyr character might possess.": "萨特人以其怪异的性格而闻名。有些人花了太多的时间来担心为什么萨特人有这样的行为。但萨特人自己就是这样，他们不觉得有必要了解他们的动力，更不用说向别人解释了。萨特人的怪癖表建议你的萨特人角色可能拥有一些品味或癖好。",

	"Many satyrs remember Xenagos as a satyr who lived life to the fullest and who played tricks that stirred up even the gods. Yet, he's also an example of how bitterness can turn a great trick nasty and how schemes that get out of hand aren't fun for anybody. What satyr wants the responsibility of being a god anyway?": "在许多萨特人的印象中，色那古斯是一个活得很充实的萨特人，他玩的把戏甚至把众神都激怒了。然而，他也是一个例子，说明痛苦会使一个伟大的诡计变得肮脏，而失去控制的计划对任何人都没有乐趣。哪个萨提尔愿意承担成为神的责任呢？",

Some shifters manifested terrible claws, others massive fangs, still others astounding speed or heightened senses. Geth's gift from his lycanthrope ancestors was sheer toughness.

	"Early in childhood, a shifter forms a bond with a beast within, a totemic force that shapes their body and mind. Some shifters believe that these spirits are independent entities, and they may speak of Bear or Wolf as ancestors or guides. Most just see the beast within as a formidable expression of their inner nature, something that emerges as the shifter's personality takes shape. The beast within is a pool of powerful instincts, and its influence is revealed by a shifter's personality: a feline shifter may be cool and distant, driven by predatory instincts, while a shifter with a lupine spirit might be drawn to find and protect a pack. When a shifter fully embraces this beast within they physically transform for a short time.": "在童年早期，变身者与内心的野兽形成了一种联系，一种塑造他们身体和心灵的图腾力量。一些移居者相信这些精神是独立的实体，他们可能会把熊或狼说成是祖先或向导。大多数人只是把内心的野兽看作是他们内在本性的一种强大的表达，是随着变身者的个性形成而出现的东西。内心的野兽是一种强大的本能，它的影响由移居者的个性所揭示：一个猫科移居者可能是冷酷和遥远的，由捕食本能驱动，而一个具有羽扇豆精神的移居者可能被吸引去寻找和保护一个群体。当一个变身者完全拥抱内心的野兽时，他们会在短时间内发生身体上的变化。",

	"While the beast within certainly has a physical impact on a shifter, it has a spiritual and psychological effect, as well. Two beasthide shifters share the same special ability, but if one has the aspect of the boar and the other is more like a bear, they'll be quite different in personality. With any shifter, identifying the beast within is a crucial part of understanding the character.": "虽然内心的野兽肯定会对移居者产生身体上的影响，但它也有精神和心理上的影响。两个兽性转变者拥有相同的特殊能力，但如果一个有野猪的一面，而另一个更像熊，他们的个性就会大不相同。对于任何移居者来说，识别内心的野兽是理解角色的一个关键部分。",

A shifter rogue harnesses their own predatory instincts. But shifters can pursue any path or faith.": "变形者对具有原始联系的类别有一种天然的倾向性。变身野蛮人从内心的野兽中汲取怒气。变身游侠放纵自己的游荡和狩猎的冲动。变身游侠则利用自己的捕食本能。但变身者可以追求任何道路或信仰。",
	"Shifters have no language of their own and often live in blended communities. Their names typically overlap with the names of other cultures in their region.

	"The warforged were built to serve and to fight. For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role.

This is the philosophy that informs the lives and minds of the aetherborn. Given just a few short years—or sometimes only a few months—to live, each aetherborn views time as exceedingly precious. Each moment spent in a way that does not bring delight is a wasted moment. And though aetherborn differ in their drives and pleasures, nearly all of them share this desire to squeeze the most out of the brief time they are given.": "当一生中的事件被压缩到几乎为零时，每个瞬间都必须被珍惜——尽可能地享受其中的乐趣。这是指导以太生灵生活和思维的哲学。只有短短几年——有时甚至只有几个月——的生命，每个以太生灵都视时间为极其珍贵。每个没有带来快乐的时刻都是浪费的时刻。虽然以太生灵在他们的动机和快乐上有所不同，但几乎所有的以太生灵都有这种愿望，即要充分利用他们所拥有的短暂时光。",

They don't eat or sleep, and they don't reproduce—nor do they have any physical sexual characteristics. Language that categorizes people into male or female categories thus breaks down when it comes to aetherborn. Most aetherborn prefer that others use the pronoun \"they\" to refer to them, since it doesn't attribute a gender that they don't possess. Only a relative few prefer \"he\" or \"she,\" having chosen to adopt a gender.": "以太生灵是以太精炼过程中的奇特生物副产品，呈人形但缺乏其他种族的生物特征。他们不进食或睡眠，也不繁殖——也没有任何生理性别特征。因此，将人们归类为男性或女性的语言在涉及以太生灵时变得模糊不清。大多数以太生灵希望他人使用代词“they”来称呼他们，因为这不会赋予他们没有的性别。只有少数人喜欢使用“he”或“she”，选择接受一个性别。",
	"The relationship between aetherborn and the Consulate is complicated. On the one hand, aetherborn understand that their race wouldn't exist without the Consulate's aether refining operations, so they feel at least some motivation to ensure that those operations continue to run smoothly. On the other hand, few aetherborn have any patience for the tedious and cumbersome politics and regulations of the Consulate, which gives them at least a little sympathy with renegade philosophy. Typically, aetherborn are drawn to one side or the other more by the lure of excitement and entertainment than by any serious political beliefs.": "虚生(aetherborn)与执政府(Consulate)之间的关系相当复杂。一方面，虚生明白如果没有执政府的以太精炼操作，他们这个种族就不会存在，因此他们至少会有一些动力确保这些操作继续顺利进行。另一方面，很少有虚生对执政府繁琐和繁重的政治和法规有耐心，这使他们对叛逆哲学至少有一些同情。通常，虚生更多地被刺激和娱乐的诱惑所吸引，而不是任何严肃的政治信仰，从而倾向于其中一方。",

Astral elves who don't dwell on the Astral Plane can live to be more than 750 years old.": "由于在灵界上时间不会流逝，居住在那个位面的灵族精灵可能非常古老，他们的长寿使他们对时间的流逝有着不同寻常的看法。一些灵族精灵可能容易忧郁，而另一些可能表现出无感情的状态。许多人寻找创造性的方式来打发时间。无论他们选择安静沉思还是冒险探索多元宇宙的边缘，灵族精灵往往会以时间的视角看待事物，认为时间对他们几乎没有或没有任何意义。不在灵界上停留的灵族精灵可以活到750岁以上。",

	"Spellcasters are common among {@race Aven (Ibis-Headed)|PSA|ibis-headed aven} drawn to follow the teachings of Kefnet. Their physical resemblance to the god of knowledge is reflected in the metal discipline, focus, and confidence for which aven spellcasters are known. They wield magic of air, wind, and sometimes water to buffet their foes, enhance their own flight, and counter enemy attacks. Hawk-headed aven who follow the path of the mage are more likely to learn sand-based magic that can cloud the air, blast their foes, or bury enemies in living dunes.": "法师在{@race Aven (Ibis-Headed)|PSA|ibis-headed aven}中很常见，他们追随凯夫涅特的教导。他们与知识之神的外貌相似，体现在金属纪律、专注和自信上，这也是鸟人法师所知名的特点。他们运用空气、风，有时还有水的魔法来打击敌人，增强自己的飞行能力，并抵御敌人的攻击。追随法师之路的鹰头鸟人更有可能学习基于沙的魔法，可以使空气混浊，轰击敌人，或将敌人埋在活沙丘中。",
	"{@race Aven (Hawk-Headed)|PSA|Hawk-headed aven} are often drawn to master techniques of long-range combat, whether the {@item javelin|PHB} that is the preferred weapon of many, the bow, or other thrown weapons. Whatever weapon they use, aven hover and swoop in the air above the fray, seeking the opportune moment to strike in exactly the right place. In line with the teachings of the god of solidarity, they often fly in tight formations with other aven in their crops, supporting and protecting each other. Aven take great pride in the precision of their attacks, relying on their keen vision and superior vantage points. They view the sharp tip of a {@item javelin|PHB} or {@item arrow|PHB} as a symbol of their love for precision, and some initiates maintain carefully tended collections of spearheads or arrowheads.": "{@race Aven (Hawk-Headed)|PSA|Hawk-headed aven}通常被吸引到掌握远程战斗技巧，无论是许多人偏爱的武器{@item javelin|PHB}，弓，还是其他投掷武器。无论使用何种武器，艾文会在混战上空盘旋，寻找合适的时机，在恰当的地方发动攻击。根据团结之神的教导，他们经常与其他艾文紧密编队飞行，相互支持和保护。艾文为自己攻击的精准感到自豪，依靠敏锐的视力和优越的高位。他们将{@item javelin|PHB}或{@item arrow|PHB}的尖端视为对精准的热爱象征，一些新入门者会维护精心收藏的矛头或箭头。",
	"A relatively small number of aven of both varieties end up focusing on hand-to-hand combat. Even there, they use their ability to fly to great advantage, often swooping down on their foes from a great height. The speed and power of a blow from a diving aven can be utterly devastating, but such a strike poses a tremendous risk to the aven as well as the target. An aven who fails to pull up from the dive in time can suffer even worse injuries than the target of the attack. Aven often minimize this risk by hurling {@item javelin|PHB|javelins} while they dive, then pulling up early after a successful throw.": "相对较少的(`%0%`)种类的艾文最终专注于近战战斗。即便如此，它们也利用飞行能力取得巨大优势，经常从高空俯冲袭击敌人。俯冲艾文的一击速度和力量可能是毁灭性的，但这样的打击对艾文和目标都构成巨大风险。如果艾文未能及时拉起俯冲，可能会遭受比攻击目标更严重的伤害。艾文经常通过在俯冲时投掷(`%0%`)，然后在成功投掷后及早拉起来最大程度地减少这种风险。",
	"Following the devastation of the distant continent of Otaria in Karona's War some two and a half centuries ago, people of many races left that land to find refuge elsewhere. Among them were the birdlike people called aven, who were largely unknown outside of Otaria prior to their exodus. Rather than dispersing around the world and assimilating into local cultures, they wandered in great flocks, forming separate communities in a few hospitable locations. The largest such flock settled in Benalia, where its people submitted themselves to Benalish law in exchange for hospitality. The aven have no representation on the Council of Seven, but many hope to see that change.": "在大约两个半世纪前的卡洛娜之战中，遥远大陆奥塔利亚遭受了毁灭，许多种族的人离开那片土地，寻找庇护。其中包括被称为艾文的鸟人，他们在离开奥塔利亚之前在外界几乎是未知的。与其在世界各地散布并融入当地文化，他们形成了庞大的群体，结成几个宜居之地的独立社区。其中最大的群体定居在贝纳利亚，他们愿意接受贝纳利亚法律以换取庇护。艾文在七人议会中没有代表，但许多人希望看到这种情况改变。",

	"One of the reasons cervans form such close-knit communities is a mistrust of outsiders. Before the Treaty, vulpin raiders and mapach thieves were serious threats. These times have long since passed, but cervans still possess a wariness that makes it hard for others to gain their trust. After the implementation of the Humblefolk Treaty, many cervans continued to live by the old ways. However, some cervan villages have since started to contain the odd family of jerbeen, or a few lone hedges.

	"The first changelings in the multiverse appeared in the Feywild, and the wondrous, mutable essence of that plane lingers in changelings today—even in those changelings who have never set foot in the fey realm. Each changeling decides how to use their shape-shifting ability, channeling either the peril or the joy of the Feywild. Sometimes they adopt new forms for the sake of mischief or malice, and other times they don a new identity to right wrongs or delight the downtrodden.": "多元宇宙中的第一批变形者出现在精灵界，那个平面的奇妙、多变本质至今仍留存在变形者身上——即使是那些从未踏足精灵领域的变形者。每个变形者都决定如何运用他们的变形能力，引导精灵界的危险或喜悦。有时候，他们会采取新形态，为了恶作剧或恶意，而有时候他们会换上新身份，来纠正错误或让受压迫者感到愉悦。",
	"In their true form, changelings appear faded, their features almost devoid of detail. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shape—one created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history—is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth, crafting whole personas complete with histories and beliefs. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.": "在他们真正的形态中，幻形生看起来模糊不清，他们的特征几乎没有细节。很少见到一个幻形生保持那种形态，因为典型的幻形生会像换衣服一样改变他们的形态。一个随意的形态——在一时冲动下创造的，没有深度或历史的——被称为面具。面具可以用来表达情绪或为特定目的服务，然后可能再也不会被使用。然而，许多幻形生会发展出具有更多深度的身份，打造完整的角色，包括历史和信仰。一个幻形生冒险者可能会为许多情况准备不同的角色，包括谈判、调查和战斗。",
	"Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; a community might be home to three healer changelings, with whoever is on duty adopting the persona of Andrea, the gentle physician. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users.": "人物可以被多个变形者共享；一个社区可能有三个治疗者变形者，无论谁值班都会扮演安德烈亚 (Andrea)，这位温和的医生。人物甚至可以通过家族代代相传，让年轻的变形者利用由之前使用者建立的联系。",
	"Corvums are a crow-like race with dark feathers and sharp minds. Their reputation in birdfolk society is nothing short of villainous, and they are regularly cast as the antagonists of any given situation. It's hard to say whether the corvums are distrusted because they behave the way they do, or if they behave the way they do because they are distrusted.": "乌鸦族是一种类似乌鸦的种族，拥有黑色羽毛和敏锐的头脑。它们在鸟类社会中的声誉简直是邪恶的，经常被描绘成任何情况下的反派。很难说乌鸦族是否不受信任是因为它们的行为方式，还是它们的行为方式是因为它们不受信任。",
	"It is widely believed that corvums only look out for themselves. Sometimes this presents as flexible morals, and at other times it simply means they follow a personal code instead of subscribing to general law. Either way, corvums are a crafty race and they tend to get what they want, one way or another.": "普遍认为乌鸦族只关心自己。有时这表现为灵活的道德观，而有时则意味着他们遵循个人准则，而非一般法律。无论哪种方式，乌鸦族都是狡猾的种族，他们往往会以某种方式得到他们想要的东西。",
	"Corvums are typically found in positions with a modicum of power, such as advisors or minor officials. The stigma they face usually prevents them from attaining too prominent a position in birdfolk society, but corvums are adept at working behind the scenes, spreading their influence subtly and to great effect.": "乌鸦人通常在担任顾问或次要官员等具有一定权力的职位中被发现。他们面临的社会污名通常阻止他们在鸟人社会中获得太显著的地位，但乌鸦人擅长在幕后工作，以微妙而有效的方式扩大他们的影响力。",

	"With unique insights into the nature of the undead, many dhampirs become adventurers and monster hunters. Their reasons are often deeply personal. Some seek danger, imagining monsters as personifications of their own hungers. Others pursue revenge against whatever turned them into a dhampir. And still others embrace the solitude of the hunt, striving to distance themselves from those who'd tempt their hunger.": "对于不死族本质的独特洞察力，许多半吸血鬼人成为冒险者和怪物猎人。他们的动机通常是非常个人的。有些人寻求危险，将怪物想象成自己渴望的化身。其他人追求复仇，想要报复让他们成为半吸血鬼的罪魁祸首。还有一些人拥抱狩猎的孤独，努力远离那些可能引诱他们渴望的人。",

The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green.

	"To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn's conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.": "对于任何龙裔来说，家族比生命本身更重要。龙裔将他们的忠诚和尊重归属于家族之上，甚至超过了神灵。每个龙裔的行为都会影响到他或她家族的荣誉，给家族带来耻辱可能会导致被驱逐和流放。每个龙裔都知道自己在家族中的地位和责任，并且荣誉要求维持这个位置的界限。",
	"A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency, of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors.

	"Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.": "矮人可以活到400多岁，所以最长寿的矮人经常记得一个非常不同的世界。例如，在遗忘王国的Citadel Felbarr（中文）中，一些最年长的矮人可以回忆起三个多世纪前的一天，当时兽人征服了这座堡垒，并将他们驱逐到持续250多年的流亡中。这种长寿使他们拥有一种人类和半身人等寿命较短种族所缺乏的世界观。",
	"Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.": "矮人坚固耐用，像他们热爱的山脉一样，经受世纪的变迁，坚忍不拔，几乎没有改变。他们尊重家族的传统，追溯他们的祖先至世界年轻时期最古老的据点的建立，并不轻易放弃这些传统。其中一部分传统是对矮人之神的虔诚，他们维护矮人的理想，包括勤劳劳作、战斗技能和对锻造的奉献。（Dwarves）",
	"Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.": "独立的矮人们坚定忠诚，言出必行，有时甚至固执到一定程度。许多矮人有着强烈的正义感，他们很难忘记所受的冤屈。对一个矮人的伤害就是对整个家族的伤害，因此一个矮人为复仇而开始的行动可能会演变成一场全面的家族冲突。",
	"Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can't find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.": "矮人王国深深地延伸在山脉之下，矮人们在那里开采宝石和贵重金属，并锻造出令人惊叹的物品。他们热爱贵金属和精美珠宝的美感和工艺，而在一些矮人中，这种热爱演变成了贪婪。无论是什么财富他们在山中找不到的，他们都通过贸易获得。他们不喜欢船只，因此，有远见的人类和半身人经常负责沿水路处理矮人商品的贸易。其他种族中值得信赖的成员在矮人定居点受到欢迎，尽管有些地区甚至对他们也是禁地。",
	"The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing.

	"Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure-for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan's lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.": "冒险的矮人可能受到各种动机的驱使，比如为了财宝本身，为了特定目的，甚至出于利他的愿望帮助他人。其他矮人可能受到神明的命令或启示的驱使，或者是直接的召唤，或者仅仅是为了给矮人神之一带来荣耀的愿望。家族和血统也是重要的动机。一个矮人可能寻求恢复家族失去的荣誉，为家族遭受的古老冤屈复仇，或者在被流放后重新赢得家族中的新位置。或者一个矮人可能在数个世纪前的战场上失落的祖先所挥舞的斧头。",
	"Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. \"The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years,\" is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf's trust.": "矮人与大多数其他种族相处得还不错。\"熟人和朋友之间的区别大约是一百年\"，这是一句可能有夸张成分的矮人谚语，但确实指出了对于像人类这样的短命种族的成员来说，要赢得矮人的信任是多么困难。",

	"Dwarves don't understand laziness or shortcuts. Just as a machine must function smoothly at all times, so too an artisan should work steadily and with care. Dwarves take pride in their work ethic, and abhor any attitude or behavior that would undermine the quality of their work. They are more thorough than speedy, and although a dwarf's work might take longer to complete, its quality makes the time worthwhile. If a job must be done, a dwarf will see that it is done correctly. And when a dwarf repairs a machine, it will work as well as it did when it was first built, if not better—and it will last.": "矮人不理解懒惰或走捷径。正如机器必须始终平稳运行一样，工匠也应该稳健细心地工作。矮人以他们的职业道德感到自豪，厌恶任何可能损害工作质量的态度或行为。他们更注重全面而非速度，虽然矮人的工作可能需要更长时间才能完成，但其质量使时间花费值得。如果有工作需要完成，矮人会确保它被正确完成。当矮人修理一台机器时，它将像刚建成时一样运行良好，甚至更好——而且会持久。",
	"Among the folk of other races, dwarves have a reputation for being utterly fearless. This is largely because their work often finds them scaling tall buildings or hanging from the undersides of airships.

With an unshakable trust in the quality of harnesses, scaffolding, and handiwork, a dwarf has no need to fear falling.": "在其他种族中，矮人以绝对无畏而闻名。这在很大程度上是因为他们的工作经常让他们攀爬高楼大厦或悬挂在飞艇的底部。然而，矮人并不鲁莽，他们会在任何潜在危险的情况下采取坚实的安全措施，充分准备以避免任何意外。凭借对安全带、脚手架和手工艺品质的坚定信任，矮人无需害怕摔落。",
	"Dwarves gravitate to where the work is. Accordingly, many dwarves appreciate the Consulate as an inexhaustible source of work opportunities. For its part, the Consulate values dwarves for their painstaking, perfectionist approach to building and maintenance. As a result, dwarves are employed at every level of the Consulate government, including having representatives among the Enlightened Keepers, the consuls themselves. Dwarf edificers keep the machinery of the cities running smoothly, while dwarf enforcers protect property and help keep the peace. However, it is the potential for making great things, more so than any philosophical leaning, that ties most dwarves to the Consulate.": "矮人会倾向于工作繁忙的地方。因此，许多矮人欣赏领事馆作为一个源源不断的工作机会。领事馆则重视矮人的苦心孤诣、完美主义的建筑和维护方式。因此，矮人在领事馆政府的各个层面都有就业机会，包括在启迪守护者和领事本身中有代表。矮人建筑师保持城市机器的平稳运行，而矮人执法者保护财产并帮助维持和平。然而，更多的是对于创造伟大事物的潜力，而不是任何哲学倾向，将大多数矮人与领事馆联系在一起。",

	"Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance.

They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.": "精灵可以活到700多岁，这使得他们对可能困扰短寿种族的事件有着广阔的视角。他们更多时候感到好奇而不是贪婪，更容易感到有趣而不是兴奋。他们往往保持超然和不为琐事所动。然而，当追求一个目标时，无论是冒险任务还是学习新技能或艺术，精灵可以变得专注且不懈。他们结交朋友和敌人的速度很慢，甚至忘记他们的速度更慢。他们对轻蔑的侮辱以不屑回应，对严重的侮辱以复仇回应。",
	"Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence.

	"Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.": "精灵出于漫游的愿望开始冒险。由于他们的寿命很长，他们可以享受几个世纪的探索和发现。他们不喜欢人类社会的步调，人类社会每天都按部就班，但在几十年间不断变化，因此他们会选择让他们自由旅行并设定自己步调的职业。精灵也喜欢展示他们的武术技能或获得更强大的魔法力量，冒险让他们可以做到这一点。有些精灵可能会加入反抗压迫的叛军，而其他人可能会成为道德事业的倡导者。",

In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.": "在宣布成年后，精灵会选择一个成年名字，尽管那些曾经认识他或她的人可能会继续使用童年名字。每个精灵的成年名字都是独一无二的创作，尽管它可能反映了受尊敬的个人或其他家庭成员的名字。男性名字和女性名字之间几乎没有区别；这里的分组仅反映了一般倾向。此外，每个精灵都有一个家族姓氏，通常是其他精灵词语的组合。一些精灵在人类中旅行时会将他们的家族姓氏翻译成普通语，但其他人会保留精灵版本。",

	"As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.": "作为一名高等精灵，你拥有敏锐的头脑和至少基本魔法的掌握。在许多D&D的世界中，有两种高等精灵。一种类型（包括格雷鹰的灰精灵和山谷精灵，龙枪的希尔瓦内斯提，以及被遗忘国度的太阳精灵）傲慢而隐居，认为自己优于非精灵甚至其他精灵。另一种类型（包括格雷鹰的高等精灵，龙枪的夸利内斯提，以及被遗忘国度的月精灵）更为普遍和友好，经常在人类和其他种族中遇到。",
	"The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.": "法伦（Faerun）的太阳精灵（也被称为金精灵或日出精灵）皮肤呈铜色，头发是铜色、黑色或金黄色。他们的眼睛是金色、银色或黑色。月精灵（也被称为银精灵或灰精灵）则更加苍白，皮肤洁白有时带有蓝色。他们通常有银白色、黑色或蓝色的头发，但各种浅金色、棕色和红色也并不少见。他们的眼睛是蓝色或绿色，并带有金色斑点。",

	"The movement of aether through the world is visible and obvious where it courses in glowing rivers across the sky, sweeps across sculpted plains, or pours through great urban pipelines. But the elves of Kaladesh are uniquely in tune with the flow of aether throughout the plane, both seen and unseen, and with the subtle ways it suffuses and influences all life. They call this flow the Great Conduit, and they believe that the only way to truly grasp it is to be a part of it, simultaneously shaping it and being shaped in return.": "在卡拉德什（Kaladesh）的精灵独特地与本位面中的以物质形式存在的和隐形的以太流动密切相连，以及它微妙地渗透和影响所有生命的方式。他们称这种流动为伟大导管（Great Conduit），并相信真正理解它的唯一方法是成为其中的一部分，同时塑造它并受其塑造。",
	"Thanks to this sensitivity, elves feel a deep connection to other living things. They engage deeply with the world around them, delighting in natural systems and social interactions alike. They revel in exploring the interconnectedness of nature and society, seeing the flow of aether from nature to invention, from person to person, from body to mind and heart.": "由于这种敏感性，(elves) 精灵们与其他生物之间有着深厚的联系。他们与周围的世界深度互动，同样喜爱自然系统和社会互动。他们热衷于探索自然与社会的相互联系，看到魔力从自然到发明，从人到人，从身体到心灵的流动。",
	"Elves live in harmony with both nature and technology. They believe that nature inspires technology: each piece of artifice is an expression of natural laws and principles, and captures one element of aether's flow in a sort of microcosmic system. Technology, in turn, can nurture the natural world, helping life grow and flourish in places and ways that would otherwise be impossible.": "精灵与自然和技术和谐共处。他们相信自然激发技术：每一件人工制品都是自然法则和原则的表达，捕捉以太流动的一个元素，形成一种微观系统。反过来，技术可以滋养自然界，帮助生命在否则不可能的地方和方式生长和茁壮发展。",
	"Elves who dwell in the forest and countryside are known as the Bishtahar. Most live in isolated communities away from other races, though they still trade with them. In fact, much of Kaladesh's food supply is grown by elves. Bishtahar cultivators grow food, decorative flowers, wood for building, and elaborate living sculptures in their meandering gardens and fields. They use the plane's ubiquitous technology to foster the growth of plants and animals, utilizing automatons as gardeners and herders, and employing elaborate, nearly invisible systems controlling heat, water, and nutrients.": "居住在森林和乡村的精灵被称为比斯塔哈尔(Bishtahar)。大多数生活在远离其他种族的孤立社区中，尽管他们仍然与他们进行贸易。事实上，卡拉迪什(Kaladesh)的许多食物供应都是由精灵种植的。比斯塔哈尔的耕种者在他们蜿蜒的花园和田地中种植食物、装饰性花卉、建筑用木材以及精美的生活雕塑。他们利用这个位面普遍存在的技术来促进植物和动物的生长，利用自动机器人作为园丁和牧羊人，并利用复杂的、几乎看不见的系统来控制热量、水分和营养物质。",
	"A garden tended by elves seems to grow naturally in an aesthetically pleasing fashion. In fact, many of the forests and plains of Kaladesh are planted and tended by elves as well. What might appear at first to be wild countryside is more likely a carefully planned landscape designed to meet the needs of the people and animals that live there.": "由精灵精心照料的花园似乎以美学上令人愉悦的方式自然生长。事实上，卡拉迪什（Kaladesh）的许多森林和平原也是由精灵种植和照料的。乍看之下可能是野生乡村的地方更可能是经过精心规划的景观，旨在满足居住在那里的人和动物的需求。",
	"Elves who forsake technology entirely are called the Tirahar. Some elves with Tirahar sympathies live within cities or farms, but most simply withdraw to the wilder areas of Kaladesh. No more than one in a hundred elves is counted among the Tirahar, and many members of other races are unaware that these reclusive elves even exist.": "完全放弃技术的精灵被称为提拉哈(Tirahar)。一些持有提拉哈同情的精灵居住在城市或农场，但大多数只是撤退到卡拉迪什(Kaladesh)更为荒凉的地区。不到百分之一的精灵被列为提拉哈的一员，许多其他种族的成员甚至不知道这些隐居的精灵的存在。",
	"The Vahadar are elves who dwell in the cities of Kaladesh. They are comfortable with technology, and work as planners, architects, aether-seers, or inventors. Some of them use the techniques of Bishtahar cultivators to grow food on rooftops, towers, and greenways. The Vahadar are generally integrated into the rest of society on Kaladesh, living in cities dominated by the other races (though, as in Ghirapur, many of them live in specific garden-like neighborhoods) and engaging in trade.": "瓦哈达尔族是居住在卡拉德什城市的精灵。他们习惯于科技，并担任规划者、建筑师、以太预言者或发明家等职位。其中一些人利用比斯塔哈耕作者的技术，在屋顶、塔楼和绿地上种植食物。瓦哈达尔族通常与卡拉德什其他种族融为一体，生活在其他种族主导的城市中（尽管在吉拉普尔等地，许多人生活在特定的花园般的社区中），并从事贸易。",
	"Sea elves fell in love with the wild beauty of the ocean in the earliest days of the multiverse.

Today, they live in small, hidden communities in the ocean shallows and on the Elemental Plane of Water.": "海精灵在多元宇宙的早期就爱上了海洋的野性美。当其他精灵在各个领域之间旅行时，海精灵却航行在最深的洋流中，探索了跨越百个世界的水域。如今，他们居住在海洋浅滩和水之元素位面上的小而隐秘的社区中。",
	"The sea elves face as many perils in their watery world as other elves face on dry land, but none are as deadly as the sahuagin. The animosity between these two races stems from the sahuagin's ferocious territoriality. They simply won't abide any other intelligent society, and they consider the entire sea to be their domain.": "海族面临着与其他精灵在陆地上面临的同样多的危险，但没有任何一种危险像鲨人那样致命。这两个种族之间的敌意源自鲨人的凶猛领土性。他们根本不容忍其他任何智慧社会，他们认为整个海洋都是他们的领地。",
	"Adding to the tension, the sahuagin worship Sekolah, the shark god, while Deep Sashelas, the sea deity of the elves, is a sworn enemy of all sharks. But even if the sea elves inexplicably began worshiping Sekolah, the sahuagin still wouldn't be able to get along with them-in the grip of a blood frenzy, sahuagin will tear apart even others of their own kind!": "在增加紧张气氛的同时，鲨鱼人崇拜塞科拉(Sekolah)，鲨鱼之神，而精灵的海洋神德普·萨沙拉斯(Deep Sashelas)则是所有鲨鱼的宿敌。但即使海精灵莫名其妙地开始崇拜塞科拉，鲨鱼人仍然无法与他们相处 - 在血腥狂暴的控制下，鲨鱼人甚至会撕裂同类！",
	"Sworn to the Raven Queen's service, the mysterious shadar-kai venture into the Material Plane from the Shadowfell to advance her will. Once they were fey like the rest of their elven kin, and now they exist in a strange state between life and death.

	"As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.": "作为一名木精灵，你拥有敏锐的感知和直觉，你敏捷的双脚让你在自己的家园森林中快速而悄然地移动。这个类别包括格雷鹰（Greyhawk）的野精灵（grugach）和龙枪（Dragonlance）的卡戈内斯提（Kagonesti），以及在格雷鹰和被遗忘的国度（Forgotten Realms）中被称为木精灵的种族。在法罗恩（Faerun），木精灵（也被称为野精灵、绿精灵或森林精灵）是隐居的，不信任非精灵的种族。",
	"Wood elves' skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.": "木精灵的皮肤倾向于呈铜色，有时带有绿色的痕迹。他们的头发倾向于棕色和黑色，但偶尔也会是金色或铜色。他们的眼睛是绿色、棕色或浅褐色。",
	"Elves are a fearless and adaptable people. They have fared better than most in the tumultuous environment of Zendikar, and many have reacted to the reappearance of the Eldrazi with resilience and courage. They remain the most prevalent race on Murasa, and have a strong presence in other regions as well. Their treetop villages seem to regrow almost as soon as they are destroyed—much like the Murasan jungles where they are found.": "精灵是一个无畏且适应力强的种族。在Zendikar这个动荡的环境中，他们比大多数种族都过得更好，许多精灵对埃尔德拉齐的再次出现做出了坚韧和勇气的反应。他们仍然是Murasa上最普遍的种族，并且在其他地区也有很强的存在感。他们的树顶村庄似乎几乎在被摧毁后立刻重新长出来——就像他们所在的Murasa丛林一样。",
	"Elves are strongly associated with green mana, the magic that flows through their forest homes. Their shamans and druids channel this magic of life and growth, communing with the land or the spirits of the departed. Striving to live in harmony with nature, they celebrate the ties between their communities and their connection with the broader world around them.": "精灵与绿色法术密切相关，这种法术流淌在他们的森林家园中。他们的萨满和德鲁伊引导着这种生命和成长的魔法，与大地或逝去的灵魂交流。他们努力与自然和谐共处，庆祝他们社区之间的联系以及与周围更广阔世界的联系。",
	"Elves are about as tall as humans, but are more slender. Their legs are long, and their pointed ears sweep back from their heads. They move gracefully and hold themselves with elegant poise, but they are a people of the woodlands, and their life in the wilds is manifested in the practical simplicity of their clothes and equipment. Never ones to waste anything that can be reused, elves stitch torn garments together into new ones, and transform broken sword blades into useful gear. They prefer leather for protection rather than metal, which they use to craft swords, spears, arrowheads, and climbing hooks.": "精灵与人类一样高，但更加纤细。他们的腿很长，尖尖的耳朵从头部向后延伸。他们优雅地移动，保持优雅的姿态，但他们是森林之民，他们在荒野中的生活体现在他们的衣服和装备的实用简约上。精灵从不浪费任何可以再利用的东西，他们把破烂的衣服缝在一起制作成新的衣服，把断裂的剑刃变成有用的装备。他们更喜欢用皮革来保护自己，而不是金属，他们用金属来制作剑、矛、箭头和攀岩钩。",
	"The elves of the imperious Joraga nation of Bala Ged have little respect for any other race of Zendikar—or even for other elves. The survival of their nation and its traditions is the Joraga elves' only goal, and they view the influence of others as a weakness. The Joraga eschew the goods and habits of others, even avoiding the pathways blazed by the Tajuru when possible. Many view the nomadic Joraga clans as little more than bands of roving murderers, but a complex culture hides behind those clans' aggressive exterior.": "Bala Ged帝国的傲慢Joraga精灵对Zendikar的其他种族甚至其他精灵都缺乏尊重。他们的国家和传统的生存是Joraga精灵唯一的目标，他们认为他人的影响是一种弱点。Joraga精灵避开他人的商品和习惯，甚至在可能的情况下避开Tajuru开辟的道路。许多人认为游牧的Joraga部落不过是一群流窜的杀手，但这些部落外表凶狠的背后隐藏着一个复杂的文化。",
	"Elves of the Mul Daya nation of Bala Ged are set apart from other elves by their relationship with the spirits of their elven ancestors. To the Mul Daya, the spirit world and the mortal realm are different only in terms of their tangibility. Death and the spirits of the dead are as much a part of the lives of the Mul Daya as is the natural world. This is not a macabre sentiment to the elves; they simply view it as the truest sense of the natural order.": "巴拉盖德（Bala Ged）的木尔达雅（Mul Daya）精灵与其他精灵有所不同，因为他们与其精灵祖先的灵魂有着特殊的联系。对木尔达雅精灵来说，灵界和凡间世界只在实体上有所不同。死亡和亡者的灵魂对木尔达雅精灵的生活同样重要，就像自然界一样。这并不是一种恐怖的情感，对精灵来说，他们只是将其视为自然秩序最真实的体现。",
	"Mul Daya elves can often be recognized by their face painting and tattooing. Many Mul Daya decorate their skins with an enwrapping vine motif, and make use of poisons and acids collected at great cost from strange creatures and plants in the depths of Kazandu.": "Mul Daya elves（木达雅精灵）通常可以通过他们的脸部绘画和纹身来辨认。许多木达雅精灵用缠绕藤蔓图案装饰他们的皮肤，并利用从卡赞杜深处的奇怪生物和植物中收集而来的毒素和酸液，尽管代价很高。",
	"The Tajuru nation is the largest of the three main elven nations, concentrated in Murasa and spread across other parts of Zendikar as hundreds of far-flung clans. Tajuru elves are the most open to people of other races, seeing their skills and perspectives as valuable new tools for survival. The Tajuru are also more open to new lifestyles, be it living in a mountaintop citadel or roaming grassy plains.": "塔苏鲁族是三大主要精灵国家中最大的一个，集中在穆拉萨(Murasa)，并分布在赞迪卡(Zendikar)的其他地区，有数百个遥远的部落。塔苏鲁精灵对其他种族的人更加开放，认为他们的技能和观点是有价值的新生存工具。塔苏鲁族也更愿意接受新的生活方式，无论是生活在山顶城堡还是漫游在草原上。",
	"Created by the god {@deity Corellon Larethian|Elven|MTF|Corellon}, the first elves were Fey beings who cavorted on various planes of existence, changing their physical forms at will. Outside the glory of Arvandor, their favourite place was the feywild—a realm of unbridled passion. It was to that place of splendors that elves fled after they were exiled from {@deity Corellon Larethian|Elven|MTF|Corellon's} presence for plotting with their god's rival, {@deity Lolth|Drow|MTF}. And it was there that they transformed from Fey creatures into Humanoids and lost their ability to shape-shift at will. Afterward, they often wept as they realized what they had lost, their sorrow made even deeper by the Feywild's influence. But in the Feywild, they also discovered the potential joys of being people of fixed forms, and they rediscovered hope once they renounced {@deity Lolth|Drow|MTF|Lolth's} treachery.": "由神{@deity Corellon Larethian|Elven|MTF|Corellon}创造，最初的精灵是精灵生物，在各种存在的平面上嬉戏，可以随意改变他们的身体形态。除了阿凡多的荣耀之外，他们最喜欢的地方是精灵界——一个充满激情的领域。在他们与神的对手{@deity Lolth|Drow|MTF}密谋被放逐后，精灵逃往了那个辉煌之地。在那里，他们从精灵生物变成了人形生物，失去了随意变形的能力。之后，他们常常哭泣，意识到自己失去了什么，他们的悲伤被精灵界的影响加深。但在精灵界，他们也发现了作为固定形态的人的潜在快乐，并在放弃{@deity Lolth|Drow|MTF|Lolth's}的背叛后重新发现了希望。",
	"Most elves eventually spread from the Feywild to other worlds, as wanderlust and curiosity drove them to the far reaches of the multiverse. In those other worlds, elves developed the physical forms now associated with them. Because of their original mutable nature, each group of elves mystically took on characteristics of the environment with which they bonded, whether forests ({@race Elf (Wood)|PHB|wood elves}), fey crossings in the Material Plane ({@race Elf (High)|PHB|high elves}), the Underdark ({@race Elf (Drow)|PHB|drow}), the Shadowfell ({@race shadar-kai|MPMM}), the Feywild ({@race eladrin|MPMM}), or oceans ({@race sea elf|MPMM|sea elves}).": "大多数精灵最终从Feywild传播到其他世界，因为漫游的欲望和好奇心驱使他们到多元宇宙的边远地区。在那些其他世界中，精灵发展出了现在与他们相关联的身体形态。由于他们最初的多变本质，每组精灵神秘地具有与他们结合的环境特征，无论是森林({@race Elf (Wood)|PHB|wood elves})、物质位面中的精灵穿越({@race Elf (High)|PHB|high elves})、地下暗域({@race Elf (Drow)|PHB|drow})、暗影界({@race shadar-kai|MPMM})、Feywild({@race eladrin|MPMM})还是海洋({@race sea elf|MPMM|sea elves})。",
	"In some places, {@deity Corellon Larethian|Elven|MTF|Corellon} has passed from elves' memory, but the god's blood flows within them still, even if they know nothing of its source. That blood is what causes them to evolve after spending centuries connected to a particular environment, so it is only a matter of time before other kinds of elves emerge.": "在一些地方，(艾尔夫)已经从精灵的记忆中消失，但神的血液仍然在他们体内流动，即使他们对其来源一无所知。那份血液让他们在与特定环境连接数个世纪后进化，因此其他种类的精灵出现只是时间问题。",
	"The Feywild is home to many fantastic peoples, including fairies. Fairies are a wee folk, but not nearly as much so as their pixie and sprite friends. The first fairies spoke Elvish, Goblin, or Sylvan, and encounters with human visitors prompted many of them to learn Common as well.": "Feywild（精灵界）是许多奇幻种族的家园，包括仙子。 仙子是一种小精灵，但远不及他们的小妖精和小精灵朋友。 最早的仙子说着精灵语、哥布林语或森语，与人类访客的相遇促使他们中的许多人也学会了通用语。",
	"Infused with the magic of the Feywild, most fairies look like Small elves with insectile wings, but each fairy has a special physical characteristic that sets the fairy apart. For your fairy, roll on the Fey Characteristics table or choose an option from it. You're also free to come up with your own characteristic if none of the suggestions below fit your character.": "灵草界的魔法赋予了大多数仙灵看起来像小精灵，但带有昆虫翅膀，每个仙灵都有一个特殊的身体特征，使其与众不同。对于你的仙灵，可以在灵草特征表上投掷骰子，或从中选择一个选项。如果以下建议都不适合你的角色，你也可以自己想出一个特征。",

So deep is the connection between a firbolg and the wild places of the world that they can communicate with flora and fauna.": "一名(firbolg)的魔法是一种模糊的形式，使他们的祖先能够穿过森林而不打扰它。 一名(firbolg)与世界的荒野之间的联系如此之深，以至于他们可以与植物和动物沟通。",

	"In their role as caretakers, firbolgs live off the land while striving to remain in balance with nature. Their methods reflect common sense and remarkable resourcefulness. During a bountiful summer, they store away excess nuts, fruit, and berries. When winter arrives, they scatter everything they can spare to ensure the animals of the wood survive until springtime.": "作为护卫者，(firbolgs) 在努力与自然保持平衡的同时依靠土地生活。他们的方法体现了常识和非凡的足智多谋。在丰收的夏天，他们储存多余的坚果、水果和浆果。当冬天来临时，他们会撒出所有能够节约的食物，以确保森林里的动物能够存活到春天。",
	"In a firbolg's eyes, there is no greater fault than greed. The firbolgs believe that the world remains healthiest when each creature takes only what it needs.

	"Firbolgs have a talent for druidic magic. Their cultural reverence for nature, combined with their strong and insightful minds, makes learning such magic an instinctive part of their development. Almost every firbolg learns a few spells, typically those used to mask their presence, and many go on to master nature magic.": "大地精灵（Firbolgs）擅长德鲁伊魔法。他们对自然的文化崇敬，加上他们强大而富有洞察力的思维，使得学习这种魔法成为他们发展的本能部分。几乎每个大地精灵都会学习一些法术，通常是用来掩盖他们存在的法术，许多人继续精通自然魔法。",

	"Most firbolgs are druids, rangers, or fighters. Among their kind, these vocations are passed down from one generation to the next.

	"Even in the face of an intrusion, firbolgs prefer a subtle, gentle approach to prevent damage to their territory. They employ their magic to make the forest an unappealing place to explore by temporarily diverting springs, driving away game, stealing critical tools, and altering trails to leave hunting or lumber parties hopelessly lost. The firbolgs' presence is marked by an absence of animals and a strange quiet, as if the forest wishes to avoid attracting attention to itself. The faster travelers decide to move on, the better.": "即使面对入侵，(firbolgs) 独角巨人仍更倾向于以微妙、温和的方式来防止对他们领土造成损害。他们利用魔法让森林变得不宜探索，暂时转移泉水、赶走猎物、偷取关键工具，改变小径，使狩猎或伐木队彻底迷失方向。独角巨人的存在以动物的缺席和一种奇怪的宁静为标志，仿佛森林希望避免引起注意。越快决定离开的旅行者，越好。",
	"If these tactics fail, the firbolgs take more direct action. Their observations of a settlement determine what happens next. If the outsiders seem peaceful, the firbolgs approach and gently ask them to leave, even offering food and other supplies to aid their departure. If those who insist on remaining respect nature, take only what they need, and live in harmony with the wood, firbolgs explore the possibility of friendship with them, as long as the outsiders vow to safeguard the forest. If the settlers clearly display evil intentions, however, the firbolgs martial their strength and magic for a single overwhelming attack.": "如果这些策略失败，费伯格人会采取更直接的行动。他们观察定居点的情况来决定接下来会发生什么。如果外来者看起来和平，费伯格人会接近并温和地要求他们离开，甚至提供食物和其他物资来帮助他们离开。如果那些坚持留下的人尊重自然，只取他们所需的东西，并与森林和谐共处，费伯格人会考虑与他们建立友谊的可能性，只要外来者发誓保护森林。然而，如果定居者明显展示邪恶意图，费伯格人会集结他们的力量和魔法，进行一次压倒性的攻击。",
	"As guardians of the wood, few firbolgs would dream of leaving their homes or attempting to fit into human society. An exiled firbolg, or one whose clan has been destroyed, might not have a choice in the matter. Most adventuring firbolgs fall into this latter category.": "作为森林守护者，很少有森林巨人会想要离开他们的家园或试图融入人类社会。一个被流放的森林巨人，或者其部族被摧毁的，可能没有选择。大多数冒险的森林巨人属于后一种情况。",
	"Outcast firbolgs can never return home. They committed some unforgivable deed, usually something that put their homeland at risk, such as starting a forest fire or killing a rare or beautiful wild creature. These firbolgs are loners who wander the world in hope of finding a new place to call home.": "被流放的森林巨人永远无法回到家园。他们犯下了一些不可饶恕的罪行，通常是使他们的家园面临风险的事情，比如引发森林大火或杀死一种稀有或美丽的野生生物。这些森林巨人是孤独的流浪者，他们在世界各地漫游，希望找到一个新的称为家的地方。",
	"Orphaned firbolgs are those whose clans or home lands have been destroyed. They become crusaders for nature, seeking to avenge their loss and prevent the further destruction of the natural world.": "孤立的冷杉巨人是那些家族或家园被摧毁的人。他们成为自然的十字军，寻求为自己的损失复仇，并阻止自然界进一步被破坏。",
	"A few rare firbolgs are entrusted by their clan with an important mission that takes them beyond their homes. These firbolgs feel like pilgrims in a strange land, and usually they wish only to complete their quests and return home as quickly as possible.": "一些稀有的冰巨人被他们的部落委以重任，使命将他们带出家园。这些冰巨人感觉自己像是在陌生的土地上朝圣者，通常他们只希望尽快完成任务并返回家园。",
	"The Firbolg Adventurers table can serve as inspiration for determining why a firbolg character leaves home.": "Firbolg（巨人族）冒险者表格可以作为确定为什么一个巨人族角色离开家园的灵感来源。",
	"Outcast for murder": "谋杀罪犯 (Outcast)",
	"Outcast for severely damaging home territory": "因严重破坏家园领地而被驱逐 (Outcast for severely damaging home territory)",
	"Clan slain by invading humanoids": "被入侵的人类杀死的氏族 (Clan)",
	"Clan slain by a dragon or demon": "被龙或恶魔杀害的家族 (Clan slain by a dragon or demon)",
	"Separated from the tribe and lost": "与部落分离并迷失方向",
	"Homeland destroyed by natural disaster": "家园被自然灾害摧毁",
	"Personal quest ordained by omens": "由征兆指引的个人任务",
	"Dispatched on a quest by tribe leaders": "被部落领袖派遣去执行任务",
	"Firbolg adopt elven names when they must deal with outsiders, although the concept of names strikes them as strange. They know the animals and plants of the forest without formal names, and instead identify the forest's children by their deeds, habits, and other actions.": "Firbolg（费伯格）在与外界打交道时会采用精灵名字，尽管名字的概念对他们来说很奇怪。他们了解森林中的动植物，却不用正式的名字来称呼，而是通过它们的行为、习性和其他动作来识别森林的子民。",
	"By the same token, their tribe names merely refer to their homes. When dealing with other races, firbolgs refer to their lands by whatever name the surrounding folk use, as a matter of tact and hospitality, but among their own kind they simply call it \"home.\" Sometimes firbolgs adopt the nicknames or titles outsiders give them under the assumption that those who need names can call them whatever they wish.": "同样地，他们的部落名称仅仅是指他们的家园。在与其他种族打交道时，森林巨人会根据周围人使用的名称来称呼他们的土地，这是一种圆滑和好客的举止，但在自己人中间，他们只是称之为“家园”。有时，森林巨人会采纳外来者给予的绰号或头衔，假设那些需要名称的人可以随意称呼他们。",
	"The gallus commonly dwell in small, familial communities as opposed to the grand perches of the Wood. Of the birdfolk, they are the most likely to be found living among the humblefolk. Gallus have a deep respect for nature and a love of gardening unmatched by other birdfolk. They value their social bonds above all else, and are always ready to help their neighbours and promote the common good. They are polite but have little patience for deceit and rudeness.": "鸡人(gallus)通常居住在小而亲密的社区，而不是树林的高大栖息地。在鸟类族群中，他们最有可能与普通人一起生活。鸡人对大自然怀有深厚的尊重和其他鸟类族群无法比拟的园艺热爱。他们视社交纽带高于一切，并随时准备帮助邻居，促进共同利益。他们彬彬有礼，但对欺诈和粗鲁却毫不耐烦。",
	"The gallus are a varied folk, resembling as many different varieties of wildfowl as there are trees in the Wood. Some are pheasant-like, others are grouse-like, while some resemble chickens or turkeys. There are dozens of variations of feathers, colors, and patterns even between gallus of the same subrace. The gallus are proud of their appearances but not to the point of vanity. Maintaining good grooming is akin to keeping a knife sharp and shows a level of respect for oneself.": "鸡人是一个多样化的种族，就像森林中的树木种类一样多样。有些类似于雉鸡，有些类似于松鸡，而有些则类似于鸡或火鸡。即使是同一亚种的鸡人之间，羽毛、颜色和图案也有数十种变化。鸡人为自己的外表感到自豪，但并非自恋。保持良好的仪容仪表就像保持一把锋利的刀一样，显示了对自己的尊重。",
	"Birdfolk are generally welcoming to other races, but the gallus are particularly well-known for their willingness to include virtually anyone in social or familial groups. In gallus culture, it is customary to always offer your seat at a table to guests. This is seen as the basis of a popular and hilarious children's story about a meal growing too cold to eat as the gallus continually give up their seats to late arrivals at a party.": "鸟人一般对其他种族都很友好，但(`gallus`)格鲁斯特别以他们愿意将几乎任何人纳入社交或家庭团体而闻名。在格鲁斯文化中，习俗是总是把自己的座位让给客人。这被视为一个流行而滑稽的儿童故事的基础，故事讲述一顿饭因为格鲁斯不断地把座位让给派对上迟到的人而变得太冷无法吃掉。",
	"Gallus are a social and communal folk. They tend to form close-knit communities wherever they roost, and their sense of pride for their community runs deep. When tragedy leaves children in their village orphaned, it is customary for gallus families to take them in. Gallus value honest work, such as farming and smithing, and share labor equally between all community members. There is nothing a gallus would not give to their neighbors in a time of need.": "长尾鸡是社交和团体性的民族。他们倾向于在任何地方形成紧密团结的社区，对他们社区的自豪感深入人心。当悲剧导致他们村庄的孩子成为孤儿时，长尾鸡家庭会习惯性地收养他们。长尾鸡重视诚实的工作，比如农耕和锻造，并在所有社区成员之间平等分享劳动。在邻里有需要时，长尾鸡愿意无私奉献。",
	"While other birdfolk might look down on gallus for their common ways, the gallus have excellent interpersonal skills. They are insightful and empathetic, but not to the point of being socially exploitable. The gallus have an ear for the truth, and are often capable of rooting out lies and dishonesty.": "虽然其他鸟人可能会因为加鲁斯（Gallus）常见的方式而看不起他们，但加鲁斯在人际交往方面表现出色。他们富有洞察力和同理心，但并不至于被社会利用。加鲁斯善于辨别真相，通常能够揪出谎言和不诚实。",
	"As a bright gallus, you are a natural leader. Growing up in your close-knit community has taught you how to inspire others and rally folks to a common cause. This air of command follows you wherever you roam.": "作为一个聪明的(gallus)，你是一个天生的领导者。在你亲密的社区长大教会了你如何激励他人，团结大家为共同的事业而努力。这种指挥的氛围无论你走到哪里都会跟随着你。",
	"As a huden gallus, you are of the land. Like the Amaranthine Hanera, you have a unique connection to the Great Rhythm of nature, and in return the Rhythm grants you many gifts. This innate bond with nature may alienate you from city life, but you will always have a home within the more remote parts of the Wood.": "作为一名胡登·加卢斯(huden gallus)，你与大地息息相关。就像不凋花汉纳拉(Amaranthine Hanera)一样，你与自然的大律有着独特的联系，作为回报，大律赐予你许多礼物。这种与自然的内在联系可能会使你与城市生活疏远，但你将永远在森林更为偏远的地方找到家园。",
	"Those who think of other planes at all consider them remote, distant realms, but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth, carry the power of the planes in their blood. The genasi are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.": "那些考虑其他位面的人通常认为它们是遥远的领域，但位面的影响可以在整个世界中感受到。有时，它会显现在一些生物身上，这些生物因出生时的意外而携带着位面的力量。元气人(genasi)就是这样的人群，是精灵和凡人的后代。",
	"The Elemental Planes are often inhospitable to natives of the Material Plane: crushing earth, searing flames, boundless skies, and endless seas make visiting these places dangerous for even a short time. The powerful genies, however, do not face such troubles when venturing into the mortal world. They adapt well to the mingled elements of the Material Plane, and they sometimes visit whether of their own volition or compelled by magic. Some genies can adopt mortal guise and travel incognito.": "元素位面对物质位面的居民常常是不宜的：压迫的大地、灼热的火焰、无边的天空和无尽的海洋使得即使短暂停留在这些地方也是危险的。然而，强大的精灵在进入凡间时并不会遇到这些麻烦。他们能很好地适应物质位面中混合的元素，并且有时会自愿造访，或者被魔法所迫。一些精灵可以化身为凡人，隐身旅行。",
	"During these visits, a mortal might catch a genies eye. Friendship forms, romance blooms, and sometimes children result. These children are genasi: individuals with ties to two worlds, yet belonging to neither. Some genasi are born of mortal-genie unions, others have two genasi as parents, and a rare few have a genie further up their family tree, manifesting an elemental heritage that's lain dormant for generations.": "在这些访问中，一个凡人可能会引起一个精灵的注意。友谊形成，爱情萌芽，有时会有孩子出生。这些孩子是元气：他们有着与两个世界的联系，却又不属于任何一个。一些元气是由凡人和精灵的结合所生，另一些有两个元气作为父母，还有极少数有一位精灵在他们家族谱中更上一层，展现出代代沉睡的元素遗传。",
	"Occasionally, genasi result from exposure to a surge of elemental power, through phenomena such as an eruption from the Inner Planes or a planar convergence. Elemental energy saturates any creatures in the area and might alter their nature enough that their offspring with other mortals are born as genasi.": "偶尔，元素之力的涌动会导致元气人的出现，比如来自内部位面的喷发或位面交汇等现象。元素能量会充斥周围的生物，并可能改变它们的本质，使它们与其他凡人的后代诞生为元气人。",
	"Genasi inherit something from both sides of their dual nature. They resemble humans but have unusual skin color (red, green, blue, or gray), and there is something odd about them. The elemental blood flowing through their veins manifests differently in each genasi, often as magical power.": "元气人从他们双重本性的两面继承了一些东西。他们看起来像人类，但皮肤颜色不同寻常（红色，绿色，蓝色或灰色），而且他们身上有一些奇怪之处。流淌在他们血脉中的元素之力在每个元气人身上表现出不同的形式，通常是作为魔法力量。",
	"Seen in silhouette, a genasi can usually pass for human. Those of earth or water descent tend to be heavier, while those of air or fire tend to be lighter. A given genasi might have some features reminiscent of the mortal parent (pointed ears from an elf, a stockier frame and thick hair from a dwarf, small hands and feet from a halfling, exceedingly large eyes from a gnome, and so on).": "在剪影中，元气族通常可以被误认为是人类。地元或水元的后代往往较为沉重，而风元或火元的后代则较为轻盈。一个元气族可能会有一些类似于凡间父母的特征（例如从精灵那里继承的尖耳朵、从矮人那里继承的结实体格和浓密头发、从半身人那里继承的小手小脚、从侏儒那里继承的极大眼睛等等）。",
	"Genasi almost never have contact with their elemental parents. Genies seldom have interest in their mortal offspring, seeing them as accidents. Many feel nothing for their genasi children at all.": "元气人几乎从不与他们的元素亲缘有联系。精灵们很少对他们的凡人后代感兴趣，将他们视为意外。许多人对他们的元气子女毫无感情。",
	"Some genasi live as outcasts, driven into exile for their unsettling appearance and strange magic, or assuming leadership of savage humanoids and weird cults in untamed lands. Others gain positions of great influence, especially where elemental beings are revered. A few genasi leave the Material Plane to find refuge in the households of their genie parents.": "一些元气生灵过着流亡的生活，因为他们令人不安的外表和奇异的魔法而被驱逐，或者他们掌控着野蛮人类和荒凉土地上的怪异邪教。另一些人则获得了重要的影响力，特别是在元素生灵受尊崇的地方。少数元气生灵离开物质位面，寻求庇护在他们精灵父母的家中。",
	"Genasi rarely lack confidence, seeing themselves as equal to almost any challenge in their path. This certainty might manifest as graceful self-assurance in one genasi and as arrogance in another. Such self-confidence can sometimes blind genasi to risk, and their great plans often get them and others into trouble.": "元气人很少缺乏自信，他们认为自己能够应对几乎任何挑战。这种确信可能在一个元气人身上表现为优雅的自信，而在另一个元气人身上则表现为傲慢。这种自信有时会让元气人对风险视而不见，他们的宏伟计划常常会让他们和其他人陷入麻烦。",
	"Too much failure can chip away at even a genasis sense of self, so they constantly push themselves to improve, honing their talents and perfecting their craft.": "失败太多会逐渐侵蚀甚至是一位 (genasis) 的自我意识，因此他们不断努力提升自己，磨练才华，完善技艺。",
	"As rare beings, genasi might go their entire lives without encountering another one of their kind. There are no great genasi cities or empires. Genasi seldom have communities of their own and typically adopt the cultures and societies into which they are born. The more strange their appearance, the harder time they have. Many genasi lose themselves in teeming cities, where their distinctiveness hardly raises an eyebrow in places accustomed to a variety of different people.": "作为稀有存在，元气可能一生都不会遇到同类。没有伟大的元气城市或帝国。元气很少有自己的社区，通常会融入他们出生的文化和社会中。他们的外表越奇特，适应的难度就越大。许多元气在繁华的城市中迷失自我，在这些习惯于各种不同人群的地方，他们的与众不同几乎不会引起注意。",
	"Those living on the frontier, though, have a much harder time. People there tend to be less accepting of differences. Sometimes a cold shoulder and a suspicious glare are the best genasi can hope for; in more backward places, they face ostracism and even violence from people who mistake them for fiends. Facing a hard life, these genasi seek isolation in the wilds, making their homes in mountains or forests, near lakes, or underground.": "那些生活在边疆地区的人们则过得更加艰难。那里的人们往往不太接受不同。有时，对元素人来说，被冷落和受到怀疑的眼光可能是他们所能期望的最好对待；在更为保守的地方，他们可能会面临被误认为是恶魔而遭到排斥甚至暴力对待的情况。面对艰难的生活，这些元素人选择在荒野中寻求隔离，他们在山区或森林中建立家园，靠近湖泊或地下生活。",
	"Most air and fire genasi in the Realms are descendants of the djinn and efreet who once ruled Calimshan. When those rulers were overthrown, their planetouched children were scattered. Over thousands of years, the bloodlines of those genasi have spread into other lands. Though far from common, air and fire genasi are more likely to be found in the western regions of Faerun, along the coast from Calimshan north up to the Sword Coast, and into the Western Heartlands to the east. Some remain in their ancient homeland.": "在诸神沙(Realms)中，大多数风元素和火元素半神族(genasi)都是卡利姆沙(Calimshan)曾经统治的巨灵(djinn)和伊弗利特(efreet)的后裔。当这些统治者被推翻时，他们的半神子女被四散。数千年来，这些半神族的血脉已经传播到其他土地。虽然并不常见，风元素和火元素半神族更有可能在费伦西部地区被发现，沿着从卡利姆沙一直北上到剑海岸(Sword Coast)，再延伸到东部的西部心脏地带(Western Heartlands)的海岸线。一些人仍然留在他们古老的家园中。",
	"In contrast, water and earth genasi have no common history. Individuals have difficulty tracing their own lineage, and bloodlines occasionally skip a generation or two. Many earth genasi originated in the North and spread out from there. Water genasi come from coastal areas, the largest concentration of them hailing from the regions surrounding the Sea of Fallen Stars.": "相比之下，水元素和土元素人没有共同的历史。个体很难追溯自己的血统，血统有时会跳过一两代。许多土元素人起源于北方，然后从那里扩散开来。水元素人来自沿海地区，其中最大的集中地来自环绕着(Sea of Fallen Stars)的地区。",
	"The distant land of Zakhara is known only in legends to most inhabitants of Faerun. There, genies and spellcasters enter into bargains, and genasi can result from such pacts. Those genasi have been sources of great weal and woe in the history of that land.": "对于法罗的大多数居民来说，遥远的扎卡拉（Zakhara）之地只存在于传说中。在那里，精灵和咒术师们会达成交易，而元素之子（genasi）可能就是这些契约的结果。这些元素之子在那片土地的历史上曾是巨大福祉和灾难的源泉。",
	"Genasi use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume distinctive names to capture their heritage, such as Flame, Ember, Wave, or Onyx.": "元气人使用他们成长环境中的人们的命名习惯。他们可能会后来采用独特的名字来体现他们的遗产，比如炎(Flame)、灰烬(Ember)、波浪(Wave)或玛瑙(Onyx)。",
	"Tracing their ancestry to the genies of the Elemental Planes, each genasi can tap into the power of one of the elements. Air, earth, fire, and water—these are the four pillars of the Material Plane and the four types of genasi. Some genasi are direct descendants of a genie, while others were born to non-genasi parents who lived near a place suffused by a genie's magic.": "追溯他们的祖先到元素位面的精灵，每个元素精灵都能够利用其中一个元素的力量。空气、土地、火焰和水—这些是物质位面的四大支柱，也是四种类型的元素精灵。有些元素精灵是精灵的直系后代，而其他人则是出生在靠近被精灵魔法浸透的地方的非元素精灵父母。",
	"A typical genasi has a life span of 120 years.": "一个典型的元气人有120年的寿命。",
	"As an air genasi, you are descended from the djinn. As changeable as the weather, your moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long.": "作为一名风元素之子，你是从巨灵(djinn)的后代。你的情绪像天气一样多变，从平静到狂暴转变迅速，但这些风暴很少持续很久。",
	"Air genasi typically have light blue skin, hair, and eyes. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few display odd patterns in their flesh or grow crystals from their scalps.": "气元素之子通常拥有淡蓝色的皮肤、头发和眼睛。一股微弱但持续的微风伴随着他们，拂动着头发，搅动着衣物。一些气元素之子说话带着气息般的声音，带有微弱的回声。少数人的肌肤上显示出奇怪的图案，或者从头皮上长出晶体。",
	"As an earth genasi, you are descended from the cruel and greedy dao, though you are not necessarily evil. You have inherited some measure of control over earth, reveling in superior strength and solid power. You tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider your options before taking action.": "作为一个地元素灵, 你是从残酷而贪婪的(earth genasi) 刀元素灵后裔，尽管你不一定邪恶。 你继承了对地球的一定控制力，沉醉于超强的力量和坚实的力量。 你倾向于避免草率的决定，在采取行动之前停顿足够长的时间来考虑你的选择。",
	"Elemental earth manifests differently from one individual to the next. Some earth genasi always have bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how often they bathe. Others are as shiny and polished as gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black, eyes sparkling like agates. Earth genasi can also have smooth metallic flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust, a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating of tiny embedded crystals. The most arresting have fissures in their flesh, from which faint light shines.": "元素之地在不同个体身上表现出不同的特征。一些大地元素人总是身上掉落着尘土，衣服上沾满泥巴，无论多频繁地沐浴都无法变干净。另一些人则闪闪发光，皮肤如宝石般晶莹剔透，肤色深褐或黑色，眼睛闪烁如玛瑙。大地元素人也可能拥有光滑的金属肌肤、暗淡的铁皮上布满锈斑、鹅卵石般粗糙的皮肤，甚至是覆盖着微小镶嵌晶体的外表。最引人注目的是他们皮肤上的裂缝，微弱的光线从中透出。",
	"As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it.": "作为一名火元素血统，你继承了伊弗利特的易怒情绪和敏锐头脑。你倾向于急躁和草率判断。与其隐藏你独特的外表，你更喜欢炫耀它。",
	"Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal-black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens sport actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices might sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.": "几乎所有火元素之灵都像内心燃烧一般炽热，这种印象被火红、煤黑或灰烬灰色的皮肤色调所加强。看起来更像人类的火元素之灵有着火红色的头发，在极端情绪下扭动不止，而更奇特的个体则头顶真实的火焰舞动。火元素之灵的声音可能听起来像火焰的噼啪声，当他们生气时，他们的眼睛会闪耀。有些人身上还带有硫磺的淡淡气味。",
	"The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths, all of these things call to your heart. You wander freely and take pride in your independence, though others might consider you selfish.": "海浪拍打声，海风中的海沫喷溅，海洋深处，所有这些都在呼唤着你的心。你自由漫步，以独立为荣，尽管其他人可能认为你自私。",
	"Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in color. A water genasi's hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song or trickling streams.": "大多数水元素之灵看起来就像刚刚洗完澡一样，皮肤和头发上结满了水珠。他们散发着新雨和清水的气味。蓝色或绿色的皮肤很常见，大多数人有着稍微有点过大的眼睛，是蓝黑色的。水元素之灵的头发可能自由飘动，摇摆不定，就像在水下一样。有些人的声音带有鲸鱼歌或潺潺小溪的余音。",
	"Giff are tall, broad-shouldered folk with hippo-like features. Some have smooth skin, while others have short bristles on their faces and the tops of their heads. As beings of impressive size and unforgettable appearance, giff are noticed wherever they go.": "吉夫(Giff)是高大、肩宽的人，具有河马般的特征。有些吉夫有光滑的皮肤，而其他人脸部和头顶有短刷毛。作为令人印象深刻的体型和难忘外貌的存在，无论走到哪里，吉夫都会引人注目。",
	"Most giff believe they originated on one world, but their home world is now the stuff of legend, because no living giff has seen it or knows where it is. The divine beings who created giff have likewise been forgotten. Their titanic petrified bodies drift on the Astral Sea, isolated and unrecognizable in their current forms.": "大多数吉夫(giff)相信它们起源于一个世界，但它们的故乡现在已成传说，因为没有活着的吉夫见过它，也不知道它在哪里。创造吉夫的神灵也已被遗忘。它们巨大的石化身体漂浮在星界海(Astral Sea)上，以目前的形态孤立而难以辨认。",
	"Although they don't realize it, giff are drawn to the Astral Plane because, on a deep psychic level, they remain connected to their creator gods, who have just enough divine spark left in them to imbue giff with sparks of their own, which giff have learned to channel through their weapons. Most giff have no idea where this so-called astral spark comes from, but they feel its presence most strongly when they are in Wildspace or the Astral Sea.": "尽管他们并没有意识到，吉夫(giff)被吸引到星界(Astral Plane)是因为在深层心灵层面上，他们与创造者神祇仍然保持着联系，这些神祇身上仅剩下足够的神圣火花，足以赋予吉夫自身的火花，吉夫已经学会通过武器引导这些火花。大多数吉夫并不知道这所谓的星界火花来自何处，但当他们身处荒野空间(Wildspace)或星界海(Astral Sea)时，他们最强烈地感受到它的存在。",
	"Giff are split into two camps concerning how their name is pronounced. Half of them say it with a hard g, half with a soft g. Disagreements over the correct pronunciation often blossom into hard feelings, loud arguments, and head-butting contests, but they rarely escalate beyond that.": "关于如何发音Giff这个名字，他们一直存在两派意见。一半的人用浊音g发音，另一半用清音g。对于正确发音的争论经常演变成情绪激烈的争执、大声争论和撞头比赛，但很少升级到更严重的程度。",
	"The story of the gith is rooted in a cruel twist of cosmic fate. Inspired by the great leader for whom the race is named, the gith rose up to overthrow the mind flayers that held them in servitude. But after they won their freedom, two factions among the gith disagreed on what kind of civilization they would forge. That disagreement quickly flared into open hostility, and the two groups distanced themselves from one another to pursue their separate agendas. They remain bitter enemies today, each side willing to fight to the death whenever they cross paths.": "gith的故事根植于宇宙命运的残酷扭曲。受到以该种族命名的伟大领袖的启发，gith起来推翻了奴役他们的掌控者——脑食人魔。但在赢得自由后，gith内部的两派意见分歧，不同意他们将建立何种文明。这种分歧迅速演变为公开敌意，两个团体迅速疏远，各自追求他们的不同议程。他们至今仍是彼此的死敌，每当相遇时都愿意战斗到死。",
	"The githyanki were motivated by revenge and convinced that they deserved to take whatever they wanted from the worlds they traveled. Ranging out from the titanic city of Tu'narath on the Astral Plane, they send raiders out to plunder the Material Plane and other worlds, bringing treasures and slaves back to their ageless realm. At the same time, they hunt down and kill mind flayers whenever possible, as recompense for what the illithids did to them.": "几萨安基(githyanki)受复仇驱使，坚信他们有权从所到之处夺取任何东西。从星界的巨城图纳拉斯(Tu'narath)出发，他们派遣掠夺者前往物质界和其他世界，将财宝和奴隶带回他们永恒的领域。与此同时，他们尽可能追捕并杀死掌控食脑怪(mind flayers)以弥补那些食脑怪对他们所做之事。",
	"The githzerai believed that the path to an enlightened civilization lay in seclusion, not conflict. Their dedication to the principles of order is so strong that they can manipulate the stuff of chaos and use it to their benefit; thus, they have carved out a stronghold for themselves on the plane of Limbo that is virtually impervious. Though the githzerai are pacifists by nature, they share the githyanki's racial hatred for mind flayers, and from time to time they send out squads to destroy illithid outposts.": "几斯赛人(githzerai)相信通往开明文明的道路在于隐居，而非冲突。他们对秩序原则的奉献是如此之强，以至于能够操纵混沌之物并将其用于自身利益；因此，他们在混乱位面(Limbo)上开辟了一个几乎无懈可击的据点。虽然几斯赛人天生是和平主义者，但他们与几斯扬奇(githyanki)一样，对脑食人怪(mind flayers)怀有种族仇恨，因此不时会派遣小队前往摧毁邪恶的魔导师前哨基地。",
	"If the two races were ever to team up against the illithids, a combined force of gith could conceivably tip the balance in their favor. But as long as the githyanki and githzerai stay at each other's throats, their goal of ultimate victory over their original common enemy will likely remain unachieved.": "如果这两个种族要联合起来对抗邪恶食脑怪，一支由吉思组成的联合力量可能会在他们有利的情况下扭转局势。但只要吉思夺魂者和吉思贼人继续互相对抗，他们对最终战胜共同敌人的目标可能会难以实现。",
	"The brutal githyanki are trained from birth as warriors.": "残忍的(吉萨因奇)从出生开始就被训练成战士。",
	"In their fortresses within Limbo, the githzerai hone their minds to a razor's edge.": "在混沌界内的他们要塞中，(githzerai) 磨练他们的心灵至锋利无比。",
	"Once members of a people who escaped servitude to mind flayers, githyanki split from their cousins, githzerai, and fled to the Astral Plane. In that timeless, silvery realm, githyanki honed their psionic powers and built a great city called Tu'narath. They have since spread throughout the multiverse, starting in outposts outside the Astral Plane, called creches, where time passes and their children can reach adulthood.": "一度是逃脱了食脑怪的奴役的一群人，(githyanki) 离开了他们的表亲 (githzerai)，逃到了星界平面。在那个永恒的、银色的领域中，(githyanki) 磨练了他们的超能力，并建立了一个名为图纳拉斯的伟大城市。自那时起，他们已经遍布整个多元宇宙，开始于星界平面之外的前哨站，称为孵育场，那里时间流逝，他们的孩子可以长大成人。",
	"A lanky people with skin tones of yellows, greens, and browns, githyanki complement their physical prowess with psionic might, instilled in them by mind flayers and cultivated over eons in the Astral Plane. Now all githyanki can use their psychic bond with that plane to access splinters of knowledge left behind by beings who travel, live, and die among the silver astral clouds.": "身材瘦长的人，皮肤呈黄色、绿色和棕色，(githyanki) 以心灵控制的力量补足了他们的身体能力，这种力量是由食脑怪赋予的，并在星界中经过数百万年的培育。现在所有的(githyanki) 都可以利用他们与那个位面的心灵联系，访问那些穿梭于银色星云之间、生活和死亡的生物留下的知识碎片。",
	"Githyanki who reside in the Astral Plane can live indefinitely.": "在星界居住的银艾可以无限期地生存。",
	"Githzerai migrated to the Everchanging Chaos of Limbo after the ancient schism that split their ancestors from their cousins, githyanki. Limbo is a roiling maelstrom of matter and energy, collapsing and reforming without purpose or direction, until a creature exerts deliberate will to stabilize it. Through their potent psionic power, githzerai carved a home for themselves amid the chaos. As the ages passed, githzerai explorers ranged out to other planes and worlds of the multiverse.": "在古老的裂痕将他们的祖先与他们的表亲githyanki分开之后，githzerai迁徙到了无定的混沌之地——林波。林波是一片物质和能量的翻滚漩涡，没有目的或方向，直到一个生物用刻意的意志来稳定它。通过他们强大的超能力，githzerai在混沌中开辟了一个家园。随着岁月的流逝，githzerai的探险者们涉足到了多元宇宙的其他位面和世界。",
	"Githzerai are generally slender, with speckled skin in shades of yellow, green, or brown. Eons of cultivating their mental powers within the endless chaos of Limbo have imbued githzerai with the ability to shape psionic energy to protect themselves and probe minds.": "几斯赛人通常身材纤细，皮肤上有黄色、绿色或棕色斑点。在无尽混沌的混沌位面中培养他们的心灵力量已经赋予几斯赛人能够塑造灵能能量来保护自己并探测思维的能力。",
	"A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.": "繁忙的活动声在地精形成紧密社区的地道和社区中弥漫着。更响亮的声音打破了这种嗡嗡声：这里传来的磨碎齿轮的嘎吱声，那里的小爆炸声，惊讶或胜利的尖叫声，尤其是爆发的笑声。地精对生活感到愉悦，享受每一个发明、探索、调查、创造和游戏的时刻。",
	"A gnome's energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome's insatiable interest in everything around.": "一位侏儒的活力和热情透过他或她那微小的身躯展现出来。侏儒平均身高略高于3英尺，体重在40至45磅之间。他们的棕褐色面孔通常带着宽阔的微笑（位于他们庞大的鼻子下方），明亮的眼睛闪烁着兴奋。他们金发往往向各个方向伸展，仿佛表达着侏儒对周围一切事物的无尽兴趣。",
	"A gnome's personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome's beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome's clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.": "一位侏儒的个性在外表上展现得淋漓尽致。与他那蓬乱的头发形成鲜明对比的是，一位男性侏儒的胡须通常被精心修剪，但常常被设计成奇特的叉子或整齐的尖角。侏儒的服装，虽然通常是朴素的土色，却经常被刺绣、压花或闪亮的宝石精心装饰着。",
	"As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. Humans might wonder about getting bored over the course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but gnomes seem to worry that even with all that time, they can't get in enough of the things they want to do and see.": "就侏儒而言，活着本身就是一件美妙的事情，他们会尽情享受他们三到五个世纪的生命。人类可能会担心在如此漫长的生命过程中会感到无聊，精灵们会花费大量时间来品味世界的美好，但侏儒们似乎担心即使有那么多时间，他们也无法尽兴地做他们想做的事情和看到的事物。",

Even as they offer ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they manage to listen carefully to others, adding the appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation along the way.": "地精说话时好像思绪迅猛得无法停下来。即使他们在各种主题上提出想法和观点，他们也能够仔细倾听他人，一边适时地加入惊讶和欣赏的感叹。",
	"Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly puns and pranks, they're just as dedicated to the more serious tasks they undertake. Many gnomes are skilled engineers, alchemists, tinkerers, and inventors. They're willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold (sometimes foolhardy) risks and dreaming large.": "虽然侏儒喜欢各种笑话，尤其是双关语和恶作剧，但他们同样专注于他们承担的更严肃的任务。许多侏儒是熟练的工程师、炼金术士、修补匠和发明家。他们愿意犯错误并在完善自己的过程中嘲笑自己，敢于冒险（有时是鲁莽的冒险）并梦想远大。",
	"Gnomes makes their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface where ever they can. Their homes are well hidden by both clever construction and simple illusions. Welcome visitors are quickly ushered into the bright, warm burrows. Those who are not welcome are unlikely to find the burrows in the first place.": "侏儒们喜欢在多山、林木茂密的土地上建造家园。他们生活在地下，但比矮人们更能享受新鲜空气，喜欢在地表上尽可能地接触自然、活生生的世界。他们的家庭被巧妙的建筑和简单的幻术所很好地隐藏起来。受欢迎的访客会迅速被引领进明亮、温暖的地洞。而那些不受欢迎的人很难找到这些地洞。",
	"Gnomes who settle in human lands are commonly gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkerers. Some human families retained gnome tutors, ensuring that their pupils enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted enjoyment. A gnome might tutor several generations of a single human family over the course of his or her long life.": "在人类居住的地方定居的侏儒通常是宝石切割师、工程师、智者或修补匠。一些人类家庭保留了侏儒导师，确保他们的学生在长寿的侏儒生命中享受严肃学习和愉快的乐趣的混合体验。一个侏儒可能在他或她的一生中为同一个人类家族的几代人担任导师。",
	"Gnomes love names, and most have half a dozen or so. A gnome's mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and uncles each give the gnome a name, and various nicknames from just about everyone else might or might not stick over time. Gnome names are typically variants on the names of ancestors or distant relatives, though some are truly new inventions. When dealing with humans and others who are \"Stuffy\" about names, a gnome learns to use no more than three names; A personal name, a clan name, and a nickname, choosing the one in each category that's the most fun to say.": "地精喜欢名字，大多数地精有大约六个名字。地精的母亲、父亲、部落长者、姨妈和叔叔都会给地精取名字，其他人的各种绰号可能会随时间而定。地精的名字通常是祖先或远亲名字的变体，尽管也有一些是真正的新创。当与那些对名字“拘谨”的人类和其他种族打交道时，地精会学会只使用三个名字；一个个人名字，一个部落名字，和一个绰号，在每个类别中选择一个最好玩的来使用。",

	"Curious and impulsive, gnomes might take up adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love of exploring. As lovers of gems and other fine items, some gnomes take to adventuring as s quick, if dangerous, path to wealth.

	"A third sub race of gnomes, the deep gnomes (or svirfneblin) live in small communities scattered in the Underdark. Unlike the duergar and the drow, svirfneblin are as good as their surface cousins. However, their humor and enthusiasm are dampened by their oppressive environment, and their inventive expertise is directed mostly toward stonework.": "地精的第三个亚种，深地精（或斯维弗内布林）居住在地下世界中散布的小社区中。与灰鬃地精和黑暗精灵不同，斯维弗内布林和他们地表的表亲一样优秀。然而，他们的幽默和热情被压抑的环境所抑制，他们的发明专长主要用于石工。",
	"Forest gnomes and rock gnomes are the gnomes most commonly encountered in the lands of the surface world. There is another subrace of gnomes rarely seen by any surface-dweller: deep gnomes, also known as svirfneblin.

	"Svirfneblin seem more like creatures of stone than flesh. Their leathery skin is usually a gray, brown, or dun hue that acts as a natural camouflage with the rock around them. Their bodies are gnarled with hard muscle or fat, and they are heavier than their small stature suggests; svirfneblin often weigh 100 pounds or more but rarely stand much more than 3 feet tall.": "地精似乎更像是石头而非肉体的生物。他们皮肤皱纹纹理分明，通常呈灰色、棕色或暗褐色，与周围的岩石形成自然伪装。他们的身体长满了坚硬的肌肉或脂肪，比他们矮小的身材暗示的要重；地精通常体重超过100磅，但很少超过3英尺高。",

They are surprisingly strong for their size, enduring toil and danger that would overwhelm most other people.": "矮人(Svirfneblin)非常适应他们地下生活的环境。他们拥有出色的暗视能力，许多人具有与黑暗精灵(drow)和灰矮人(duergar)天生施法能力不相上下的魔法天赋。尽管体型较小，他们的力量出奇地强大，能够承受其他大多数人无法承受的劳累和危险。",
	"Despite their guarded natures, svirfneblin aren't joyless. They admire skillful work and delicate craftsmanship, just like any other gnome.

They are also expert gemcutters and miners, and they prize rubies above all other gemstones.": "尽管他们性情谨慎，地底侏儒并不缺乏快乐。他们欣赏高超的技艺和精湛的工艺，就像其他任何一位侏儒一样。地底侏儒热爱各种宝石，他们大胆地在最深最暗的隧道中寻找珍贵的宝石。他们还是熟练的宝石切割工和矿工，他们尤其珍视红宝石胜过其他任何宝石。",
	"Svirfneblin are known as deep gnomes because they choose to live far below the earth's surface. Most svirfneblin never see the light of day. Their homes are well-hidden strongholds concealed by mazelike passages and clever illusions. Vast networks of mine tunnels ring most svirfneblin settlements, guarded by deadly traps and concealed sentries. Once a traveler passes through the outer defenses, the tunnels open up into marvelous cavern-towns carved from the surrounding rock with exquisite care. The svirfneblin are austere in their comforts compared to their surface cousins, but they take great pride in their stonework.": "地下侏儒(Svirfneblin)因选择居住在地表以下而被称为深地侏儒。大多数地下侏儒从不见天日。他们的家园是隐藏良好的据点，被迷宫般的通道和巧妙的幻术所掩盖。大部分地下侏儒定居点周围环绕着广阔的矿井隧道网络，由致命陷阱和隐秘哨兵守卫。一旦旅行者通过外围防御，隧道就会展现出由周围岩石精心雕刻而成的奇妙洞穴城镇。地下侏儒在舒适方面比起地表堂兄要朴素，但他们对自己的石工技艺感到非常自豪。",

	"Surface-dwelling gnomes often take up the adventurer's life out of sheer curiosity about the world around them, eager to see new things and meet new people.": "地表居住的侏儒们经常出于对周围世界的好奇而选择冒险者的生活，渴望看到新事物并结识新朋友。",
	"By comparison, most svirfneblin possess very little wanderlust and rarely travel far from home. They see the surface world as a bewildering place without boundaries and filled with unknown dangers.": "相比之下，大多数地底侏儒(Svirfneblin)几乎没有什么漫游的冲动，很少远离家乡。他们将地表世界视为一个没有边界、充满未知危险的令人困惑的地方。",
	"Nevertheless, a few svirfneblin understand that it is necessary to know something about what is happening on the surface near their hidden refuges. As a result, some svirfneblin become scouts, spies, or messengers who venture abroad, doing their best to avoid attention.": "然而，一些地下侏儒明白了解在他们隐藏的避难所附近发生的事情是必要的。因此，一些地下侏儒成为了侦察兵、间谍或信使，冒险前往外面，尽力避免引起注意。",

	"A few svirfneblin become merchants who deal with other races both above and below ground. Drow, duergar, and other peoples know that svirfneblin are usually neutral in outlook and typically honest in their dealings.

	"Svirfneblin prefer less flamboyant names than their rock gnome or forest gnome cousins. Clan names reflect skills or occupations that a particular family is associated with, and sometimes change if a noteworthy individual strikes out in a new direction.": "矮人族群（Svirfneblin）更喜欢比他们的岩石侏儒（rock gnome）或森林侏儒（forest gnome）表兄弟更加低调的名字。氏族名字反映了一个特定家族所关联的技能或职业，有时会因为一个显赫人物走向新的方向而改变。",

	"In the Forgotten Realms, deep gnomes live within a perilous, subterranean world known as the Underdark. This maze of caverns and tunnels is home to some of the most feared creatures in Faerûn. Because of this, the svirfneblin that dwell here are much more distrusting and wary than their kin on other worlds. Rarely do they allow strangers within their midst, and those that they must deal with are kept at arms length. If one is lucky enough to be trusted by the deep gnomes, they are a friend for life. For the svirfneblin of the Underdark, genuine trust is a commodity far more valuable than gold.": "在被遗忘的国度中，深地侏儒生活在一个危险的地下世界，被称为地底世界。这个洞穴和隧道的迷宫是法罗恩大陆上一些最令人恐惧的生物的家园。因此，居住在这里的斯维弗内布林比其他世界的同族更加不信任和警惕。他们很少让陌生人进入他们的中间，而那些必须与他们打交道的人也被保持在一定距离之外。如果有幸得到深地侏儒的信任，他们将是终生的朋友。对于地底世界的斯维弗内布林来说，真正的信任比黄金更有价值。",

They prize ancient artifacts not for their inherent value, but primarily as a mark of status—for a precious trophy proves that its owner survived a delve into a deep and dangerous ruin.": "地精是一种好奇而适应性强的种族，受制于他们的体型小、天生胆小和严重缺乏常识。他们热衷于探索其他人犹豫进入的地区，并痴迷于玩弄那些明智人士会小心谨慎对待的魔法。他们珍视古代文物，不是因为其内在价值，而主要是作为地精的身份象征——珍贵的战利品证明其主人幸存于深邃危险的废墟探险中。",
	"Goblins are associated with red mana. Their shamans are fond of spells that create or control fire and lightning to smite their foes, and they are quick to follow their impulses and passions into action without much forethought. Life to a goblin is an adventure full of new things to explore and experience.": "哥布林与红色法术有关。他们的萨满喜欢使用能够创造或控制火焰和闪电的法术来打击敌人，他们往往会在没有太多事先考虑的情况下迅速跟随自己的冲动和激情行动。对于哥布林来说，生活就是一场充满新事物探索和体验的冒险。",
	"A typical goblin stands between three-and-a-half and five feet tall, with a slender, elongated build. Goblins' arms are unusually long and spindly, making them adept at climbing cliffs and trees. Their skin has a stony texture, ranging in color from red-brown to moss green or gray. Their ears are large and swept back, their eyes are intensely red, and many sport heavy bone protrusions on their spines or elbows. Males have similar growths jutting from their chins, while females have heavier growths on their foreheads.": "一个典型的地精身高在三英尺半到五英尺之间，身材纤细且细长。地精的手臂异常长而纤细，使它们擅长攀爬悬崖和树木。它们的皮肤质地坚硬，颜色从红褐色到苔藓绿或灰色不等。它们的耳朵又大又向后倾斜，眼睛呈强烈的红色，许多地精背部或肘部长有沉重的骨突起。雄性地精下巴上也有类似的突起，而雌性地精额头上的突起更为明显。",
	"This distinctive appearance is a direct result of the goblins' unusual diet. Before the Eldrazi's rise, goblins supplemented their normal diet with a kind of rock they pounded into bits and called \"grit.\" The presence of the Eldrazi in Zendikar has poisoned this rock, so the goblins have taken to eating powdered hedrons instead. Eating this magic-infused stone has given the goblins resistance to the maddening psychic emanations of the Eldrazi. As an added benefit, it toughens their skin, protecting them from the elements and from physical dangers.": "这种独特的外观是地精们不寻常饮食的直接结果。在奥术巨怪（Eldrazi）崛起之前，地精们会在正常饮食中加入一种他们将岩石研磨成碎片并称之为“砂砾”的食物。在Zendikar的奥术巨怪出现后，这种岩石被污染，因此地精们开始食用粉碎的六面石块（hedrons）代替。食用这种富有魔法的石头使地精们对奥术巨怪发出的令人疯狂的心灵波动产生了抵抗力。作为额外的好处，它还使他们的皮肤变得更坚韧，保护他们免受自然元素和物理危险的伤害。",
	"Ahh the Dankwood goblins! I have adventured far and wide in my time and never have I met such unique and interesting goblins as these. Perhaps it is the magical nature of the Dankwood itself as this forest was once rumored to have been the ancient sanctum of a powerful Netherese wizard, but who is to say? This world is a wondrous one and everywhere you go, something new is there to dazzle and amaze!": "啊，幽暗森林哥布林！我在我的冒险生涯中走过很远，从未遇到过像这样独特而有趣的哥布林。也许是幽暗森林本身的神奇性质，因为传说这片森林曾经是一位强大的尼瑟瑞斯巫师的古老圣所，但谁又能说得准呢？这个世界是一个神奇的世界，无论你走到哪里，总会有新的事物让你眼前一亮，让你惊叹不已！",
	"Dankwood goblins are much like any other run-of-the-mill goblin but they are much more gentle and artistic than the savage and uncouth goblins of the world.": "丹克伍德地精与其他普通地精一样，但他们比世界上野蛮粗鲁的地精更温和和富有艺术感。",
	"They are inquisitive and have a magical bond with the small forest creatures with which they are often friends. They are fast and nimble and love to explore. Because of this they make great adventurers and guides.": "他们很好奇，与小森林生物有着神奇的联系，通常是它们的朋友。他们敏捷迅速，热爱探索。因此，他们是出色的冒险者和向导。",
	"Goblins are native to Ixalan, and their eager curiosity drew them to the ships of the Brazen Coalition when the pirates first made landfall on the Sun Empire's shores. Though they still thrive in remote jungle colonies, goblins are most commonly seen swinging on the ropes of sleek pirate ships.": "哥布林是伊克沙兰的本地物种，他们的好奇心吸引了他们前往无畏联盟的船只，当海盗们第一次登陆太阳帝国的海岸时。尽管他们仍然在偏远的丛林殖民地茁壮成长，但最常见的是看到哥布林荡秋千在时髦的海盗船上的绳索上。",
	"Goblins stand about three feet tall, though they rarely stand upright. They prefer a crouched posture that lets them scramble quickly on all fours, aided by their long prehensile tails. Their hearing and eyesight make them excellent lookouts, and their agility serves them well as crew members on pirate ships. They climb, swing, and jump easily among a ship's ropes, and can get into tight spaces that humans can't. For better or worse, many goblins are also incorrigible pranksters, and they often have a hard time determining when a prank is inappropriate, is poorly timed, or has gone too far.": "地精大约三英尺高，尽管它们很少直立站立。它们更喜欢蹲姿，这样可以让它们四肢着地迅速移动，长长的可摆动尾巴帮助它们。它们的听力和视力使它们成为出色的警戒哨兵，而它们的敏捷性使它们成为海盗船上优秀的船员。它们可以轻松地在船绳之间攀爬、荡秋千和跳跃，并且可以进入人类无法进入的狭小空间。无论好坏，许多地精也是顽皮捣蛋鬼，它们常常很难判断恶作剧何时不合适、时机不对，或者已经过分。",
	"Smaller and weaker than their cousins, and with larger hands and feet, goblins of the Grotag tribe attempt to live by their wits—though seldom with much success. When a Grotag goblin has the bright idea of trying to tame fleshpiercer mites, at least a few others will be willing to follow that goblin into a nest—usually to predictably horrible results. But though the Grotag seem to have a never-ending supply of bad ideas, and a horrible ratio of bad ideas to good, the Grotag likewise seem to have a never-ending supply of Grotag. As such, by trial and error (and more error), these goblins have stumbled across a great deal of knowledge useful for surviving the deep places of Zendikar, and for dealing with the creatures that live there. The Grotag imagine themselves to have a sort of empathy with beasts, and they lose hundreds of goblins each year to ill-advised attempts at monster taming. But, every now and again, one of these efforts is successful.": "比起他们的表亲，Grotag 部落的地精们更小更弱，但手脚更大。他们试图凭借智慧生存，尽管很少成功。当一个 Grotag 地精有了驯服肉穿刺螨的聪明主意时，至少会有一些其他地精愿意跟随他进入巢穴——通常结果可预见地很可怕。尽管 Grotag 部落似乎有着永无止境的糟糕主意供应，以及糟糕主意与好主意的可怕比例，但同样，Grotag 部落似乎也有着永无止境的 Grotag 供应。因此，通过反复试验（以及更多的错误），这些地精已经偶然发现了许多有用于在Zendikar深处生存以及应对那里生物的知识。Grotag 部落自认为与野兽有某种共情，每年有数百地精因为不明智的怪物驯养尝试而丧生。但是，偶尔也会有这些努力取得成功。",
	"The Lavastep tribe is the most industrious of the goblin tribes, and possesses much hard-won knowledge of the geothermal activity in Akoum. More so than members of the other tribes, the Lavastep goblins build surprisingly effective equipment out of the crystal shards and veins of strange metals that occasionally boil up to the surface. The most warlike of their kind, Lavastep goblins frequently harass the kor, elves, and humans of Akoum.": "熔岩步族是地精部落中最勤劳的一个，拥有关于阿库姆地热活动的许多艰苦获得的知识。与其他部落成员相比，熔岩步地精更擅长利用偶尔从地下冒出的水晶碎片和奇异金属矿脉制造出令人惊讶的有效装备。作为种族中最好战的一群，熔岩步地精经常骚扰阿库姆的科尔人、精灵和人类。",
	"Among the goblins, the Tuktuk are most likely to hire themselves out as ruin guides to other races. Of course, their usual plan is to help find something of value, steal it, trigger a trap intentionally, and then run.": "在地精中，托克托克(Tuktuk)最有可能将自己雇佣为废墟向其他种族提供导游服务。当然，他们通常的计划是帮助找到有价值的东西，偷走它，故意触发陷阱，然后逃跑。",
	"The first goliaths lived on the highest mountain peaks—far above the tree line, where the air is thin and frigid winds howl. Distantly related to giants and infused with the supernatural essence of their ancestors' mountainous home, goliaths stand between 7 and 8 feet tall and have a wide array of skin tones resembling different types of stone.": "第一个巨人族居住在最高的山峰上——远远超过树线，那里空气稀薄，寒风呼啸。作为巨人的远亲，并融合了祖先山居的超自然精华，石人族的身高在7到8英尺之间，皮肤色调多样，类似不同类型的石头。",
	"At the highest mountain peaks-far above the slopes where trees grow and where the air is thin and the frigid winds howl-dwell the reclusive goliaths. Few folk can claim to have seen a goliath, and fewer still can claim friendship with them. Goliaths wander a bleak realm of rock, wind, and cold. Their bodies look as if they are carved from mountain stone and give them great physical power. Their spirits take after the wandering wind, making them nomads who wander from peak to peak. Their hearts are infused with the cold regard of their frigid realm, leaving each goliath with the responsibility to earn a place in the tribe or die trying.": "在最高的山峰上——远远超过树木生长的斜坡和稀薄的空气以及刺骨的寒风呼啸的地方——居住着隐居的巨人族。很少有人能声称见过巨人族，更少的人能声称与他们交友。巨人族徘徊在一片充满岩石、风和寒冷的荒凉领域。他们的身体看起来就像是从山石雕刻而成，赋予他们极大的体力。他们的精神像流浪的风一样，使他们成为从一个山峰到另一个山峰漫游的游牧民族。他们的心灵充满了对寒冷领域的冷漠，使每个巨人族都有责任赢得部落中的位置，即使要拼死也在所不惜。",
	"Every day brings a new challenge to a goliath. Food, water, and shelter are rare in the uppermost mountain reaches. A single mistake can bring doom to an entire tribe, while an individual's heroic effort can ensure the entire group's survival.": "每一天都给戈利亚人带来新的挑战。在最高的山脉地带，食物、水和住所都很稀缺。一个错误可能会导致整个部落的厄运，而一个个体的英勇努力可以确保整个团体的生存。",
	"Goliaths thus place a premium on self-sufficiency and individual skill. They have a compulsion to keep score, counting their deeds and tallying their accomplishments to compare to others. Goliaths love to win, but they see defeat as a prod to improve their skills.": "巨人因此非常重视自给自足和个人技能。他们有一种强烈的计分习惯，会记录自己的事迹和成就，以便与他人比较。巨人喜欢赢，但他们把失败看作是提高技能的动力。",
	"This dedication to competition has a dark side. Goliaths are ferocious competitors, but above all else they are driven to outdo their past efforts. If a goliath slays a dragon, he or she might seek out a larger, more powerful wyrm to battle. Few goliath adventurers reach old age, as most die attempting to surpass their past accomplishments.": "这种对竞争的执着有一个黑暗的一面。巨人是凶猛的竞争者，但最重要的是他们被驱使着要超越自己过去的努力。如果一个巨人杀死了一条龙，他或她可能会寻找一条更大、更强大的巨龙来战斗。很少有巨人冒险者能活到老年，因为大多数人在试图超越自己过去的成就时死去。",
	"For goliaths, competition exists only when it is supported by a level playing field. Competition measures talent, dedication, and effort. Those factors determine survival in their home territory, not reliance on magic items, money, or other elements that can tip the balance one way or the other. Goliaths happily rely on such benefits, but they are careful to remember that such an advantage can always be lost. A goliath who relies too much on them can grow complacent, a recipe for disaster in the mountains.": "对于巨人族，只有在公平竞争的基础上才存在竞争。竞争衡量的是才华、奉献精神和努力。这些因素决定了在他们的家园中生存，而不是依赖魔法物品、金钱或其他可能左右天平的元素。巨人族乐意依赖这些好处，但他们小心地记住这样的优势总是会失去的。一个太过依赖这些好处的巨人族可能会变得自满，在山区这是灾难的前兆。",
	"This trait manifests most strongly when goliaths interact with other folk. The relationship between peasants and nobles puzzles goliaths. If a king lacks the intelligence or leadership to lead, then clearly the most talented person in the kingdom should take his place. Goliaths rarely keep such opinions to themselves, and mock folk who rely on society's structures or rules to maintain power.": "当巨人与其他人交往时，这种特质表现得最为明显。农民和贵族之间的关系让巨人感到困惑。如果国王缺乏智慧或领导能力，那么显然王国中最有才华的人应该取而代之。巨人很少会对此类观点保持沉默，并嘲笑那些依赖社会结构或规则来维持权力的人。",
	"Among goliaths, any adult who can't contribute to the tribe is expelled. A lone goliath has little chance of survival, especially an older or weaker one. Goliaths have little pity for adults who can't take care of themselves, though a sick or injured individual is treated, as a result of the goliath concept of fair play.": "在巨人族中，任何无法为部落做出贡献的成年人都会被驱逐。一个孤独的巨人几乎没有生存的机会，尤其是年长或体弱的。巨人对无法照顾自己的成年人几乎没有怜悯之心，尽管一个生病或受伤的个体会得到治疗，这是因为巨人对公平竞技的概念。",
	"A permanently injured goliath is still expected to pull his or her weight in the tribe. Typically, such a goliath dies attempting to keep up, or the goliath slips away in the night to seek the cold will of fate.": "一个永久受伤的巨人仍然被期望在部落中尽力而为。通常，这样的巨人会在试图跟上时死去，或者在夜晚悄悄离开，寻求命运的冷酷意志。",
	"In some ways, the goliath drive to outdo themselves feeds into the grim inevitability of their decline and death. A goliath would much rather die in battle, at the peak of strength and skill, than endure the slow decay of old age. Few folk have ever meet an elderly goliath, and even those goliaths who have left their people grapple with the urge to give up their lives as their physical skills decay.": "在某种程度上，巨人们努力超越自己的驱动力加剧了他们衰落和死亡的不可避免性。一个巨人宁愿在战斗中死去，在力量和技能的巅峰，也不愿忍受年老时的缓慢衰退。很少有人见过年迈的巨人，即使那些离开他们族群的巨人也在与放弃生命的冲动抗争，因为他们的身体技能在衰退。",
	"Because of their risk-taking, goliath tribes suffer from a chronic lack of the experience offered by longterm leaders. They hope for innate wisdom in their leadership, for they can rarely count on a wisdom grown with age.": "由于他们喜欢冒险，巨人部落饱受长期领袖经验不足的困扰。他们希望领导层具备天生的智慧，因为他们很少能依赖随着年龄增长而获得的智慧。",
	"Every goliath has three names: a birth name assigned by the newborn's mother and father, a nickname assigned by the tribal chief, and a family or clan name. A birth name is up to three syllables long. Clan names are five syllables or more and end in a vowel.": "每个巨人都有三个名字：一个由新生儿的父母指定的出生名，一个由部落酋长指定的绰号，以及一个家族或氏族名。出生名最多有三个音节。氏族名有五个或更多音节，并以元音结尾。",
	"Birth names are rarely linked to gender. Goliaths see females and males as equal in all things, and they find societies with roles divided by gender to be puzzling or worthy of mockery. To a goliath, the person who is best at a job should be the one tasked with doing it.": "出生名字很少与性别挂钩。巨人族认为女性和男性在一切事情上都是平等的，他们觉得按性别划分角色的社会是令人困惑或值得嘲笑的。对于巨人族来说，最擅长某项工作的人应该被委以重任。",
	"A goliath's nickname is a description that can change on the whim of a chieftain or tribal elder. It refers to a notable deed, either a success or failure, committed by the goliath. Goliaths assign and use nicknames with their friends of other races, and change them to refer to an individual's notable deeds.": "一个巨人的绰号是一个可以随着酋长或部落长者的心血来潮而改变的描述。它指的是巨人所犯的一个显著行为，无论是成功还是失败。巨人们会给其他种族的朋友起绰号，并根据个人的显著行为来更改这些绰号。",
	"Goliaths present all three names when identifying themselves, in the order of birth name, nickname, and clan name. In casual conversation, they use their nickname.": "巨人们在自我介绍时会依次提及他们的出生名、昵称和部落名。在随意交谈中，他们会使用自己的昵称。",
	"Aukan, Eglath, Gae-Al, Gauthak, Ilikan, Keothi, Kuori, Lo-Kag, Manneo, Maveith, Nalla, Orilo, Paavu, Pethani, Thalai, Thotham, Uthal, Vaunea, Vimak": "奥坎 (Aukan), 埃格拉斯 (Eglath), 盖-阿尔 (Gae-Al), 高萨克 (Gauthak), 伊利坎 (Ilikan), 凯奥西 (Keothi), 库奥里 (Kuori), 洛-卡格 (Lo-Kag), 曼奈奥 (Manneo), 马维斯 (Maveith), 纳拉 (Nalla), 奥里洛 (Orilo), 帕乌 (Paavu), 佩萨尼 (Pethani), 塔莱 (Thalai), 索瑟姆 (Thotham), 乌萨尔 (Uthal), 瓦尼亚 (Vaunea), 维马克 (Vimak)",

	"Hadozees' progenitors were mammals no bigger than housecats. Hunted by larger natural predators, they took to the trees and evolved wing-like flaps that enabled them to glide from branch to branch.": "Hadozees（哈多兹）的祖先是比家猫还小的哺乳动物。受到更大的自然捕食者的猎杀，它们开始爬上树，并演化出类似翅膀的褶皱，使它们能够在树枝间滑翔。",
	"Today, hadozees are sapient, bipedal beings eager to leave behind the fearsome predators of their homeworld and explore other worlds.": "今天，哈多兹(%num%)是有智慧的、两足行走的生物，渴望摆脱他们家园中可怕的捕食者，探索其他世界。",
	"In addition to being natural climbers, hadozees have feet that are as dexterous as their hands, even to the extent of having opposable thumbs. Membranes of skin hang loosely from their arms and legs. When stretched taut, these membranes enable hadozees to glide. Hadozees wrap these wings around themselves to keep warm.": "除了擅长攀爬外，哈多兹族(hadozees)的脚和手一样灵巧，甚至具有可对抗的拇指。他们的手臂和腿上有一层松弛的皮膜。当拉紧时，这些膜可以让哈多兹族滑翔。哈多兹族会将这些翅膀裹在身上保暖。",
	"Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing to adulthood while their peers continue to live as children, growing restless in the timeless elven realms. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.": "走在两个世界之间，却真正属于任何一个的半精灵，结合了一些人说是他们精灵和人类父母最好的品质：人类的好奇心、创造力和雄心，又受到精灵的精致感官、热爱大自然和艺术品味的影响。一些半精灵生活在人类中间，因为情感和身体上的差异而与他人分隔，看着朋友和亲人变老，而时间几乎不触及他们。另一些与精灵同住，成年后，而他们的同龄人仍然像孩子一样生活，在永恒的精灵领域里变得不安。许多半精灵无法融入任何一个社会，选择了孤独漫游的生活，或者加入其他不合群的人和被流放者一起冒险生活。",
	"To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they look human. In height, they're on par with both parents, though they're neither as slender as elves nor as broad as humans. They range from under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and heavier than women. Half-elf men do have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ancestry. Half-elven coloration and features lie, somewhere between their human and elf parents, and thus show a variety even more pronounced than that found among either race. They tend to have the eyes of their elven parents.": "对于人类来说，半精灵看起来像精灵，而对于精灵来说，他们看起来像人类。在身高方面，他们与双亲相当，尽管他们既不像精灵那样苗条，也不像人类那样宽阔。他们的身高从不到5英尺到约6英尺不等，体重从100磅到180磅不等，男性只比女性略高略重。半精灵男性会长胡须，有时会留胡子来掩饰他们的精灵血统。半精灵的肤色和特征介于他们的人类和精灵父母之间，因此显示出比任何一种种族都更加明显的多样性。他们往往拥有他们精灵父母的眼睛。",
	"Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are welcome in human cities and somewhat less welcome in elven forests. In large cities in regions where elves and humans interact often, half-elves are sometimes numerous enough to form small communities of their own. They enjoy the company of other half-elves, the only people who truly understand what it is to live between these two worlds.": "半精灵没有自己的领土，尽管他们在人类城市受欢迎，在精灵森林中却不那么受欢迎。在精灵和人类经常互动的地区的大城市中，半精灵有时候人数足够多，可以组成自己的小社区。他们喜欢与其他半精灵为伴，只有他们才真正理解生活在这两个世界之间是什么感觉。",
	"In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are uncommon enough that one might live for years without meeting another. Some prefer to avoid company altogether, wandering the wilds as foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting civilization only rarely. Like elves, they are driven by the wanderlust that comes of their longevity. Others, in contrast, throw themselves into the thick of society, putting their charisma and social skills to great use in diplomatic roles or as swindlers.": "在世界的大部分地区，半精灵并不常见，以至于一个人可能多年都不会遇到另一个半精灵。一些人更喜欢避开人群，独自在荒野中漫游，充当森林守护者、猎人或冒险家，很少去文明社会。和精灵一样，他们被漫长寿命带来的漫游欲望所驱使。另一些人则相反，投身于社会的浓浓人群中，运用自己的魅力和社交技巧在外交角色或骗子中大显身手。",
	"Half-elves use either human or elven naming conventions. As if to emphasize that they don't really fit in to either society, half-elves raised among humans are often given elven names, and those raised among elves often take human names.": "半精灵使用人类或精灵的命名习惯。仿佛强调他们并不真正融入任何社会一样，被人类抚养长大的半精灵通常被赋予精灵的名字，而在精灵中长大的半精灵则常取人类的名字。",
	"Many half-elves learn at an early age to get along with everyone, defusing hostility and finding common ground. As a race, they have elves grace without elves aloofness and human energy without human boorishness. They often make excellent ambassadors and go-betweens (except between elves and humans, since each side suspects the half-elf of favoring the other).": "许多半精灵在年幼时就学会了与所有人相处，化解敌意并找到共同点。作为一个种族，他们拥有精灵的优雅而没有精灵的冷漠，人类的活力却没有人类的粗鲁。他们通常是出色的大使和中间人（除了在精灵和人类之间，因为双方都怀疑半精灵偏袒另一方）。",
	"Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to a standstill after years of conflict, orc and human tribes sometimes form alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.": "在一位强大术士的领导下或者在经过多年冲突后陷入僵持状态后，兽人和人类部落有时会形成联盟，联合成更大的部落，对附近的文明土地构成恐怖。当这些联盟通过婚姻缔结时，半兽人就诞生了。一些半兽人崛起成为兽人部落的骄傲酋长，他们的人类血统使他们在与全血统兽人对手的竞争中占据优势。一些冒险走向世界，证明自己在人类和其他文明种族中的价值。其中许多人成为冒险者，因其伟大事迹而成就卓越，因其野蛮风俗和狂暴之气而臭名昭著。",
	"Half-orcs' grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering builds make their orcish heritage plain for all to see. Half-orcs stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between 180 and 250 pounds.": "半兽人的灰色皮肤、倾斜的额头、突出的下巴、突出的牙齿和高大的身材使他们的兽人血统一目了然。半兽人的身高在6到7英尺之间，通常体重在180到250磅之间。",
	"Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other scars, though, mark an Orc, or half-orc as a former slave or a disgraced exile. Any half-orc who has lived among or near orcs has scars, whether they are marks of humiliation or of pride, recounting their past exploits and injuries. Such a half-orc living among humans might display these scars proudly or hide them in shame.": "兽人视战斗伤疤为骄傲的象征，将装饰性伤疤视为美丽的事物。然而，其他伤疤则标志着兽人或半兽人曾是奴隶或被流放的耻辱。任何曾与兽人生活或居住过的半兽人都有伤疤，无论是耻辱的印记还是骄傲的战功和伤害。这样的半兽人若生活在人类社会中，可能会自豪展示这些伤疤，也可能因羞耻而隐藏起来。",
	"The one-eyed god Gruumsh created the Orcs, and even those orcs who turn away from his worship can't fully escape his influence. The same is true of half orcs, though their human blood moderates the impact of their orcish heritage. Some half-orcs hear the whispers of Grummsh in their dreams, calling them to unleash the rage that simmers within them. Others feel Gruumsh's exultation when they join in melee combat-and either exult along with him or shiver with fear and loathing. Half-orcs are not evil by nature, but evil does lurk within them, whether they embrace it or rebel against it.": "独眼神格鲁姆什(Gruumsh)创造了兽人(Orcs)，即使那些背弃他崇拜的兽人也无法完全摆脱他的影响。半兽人也是如此，尽管他们的人类血统减轻了兽人遗传的影响。一些半兽人在梦中听到格鲁姆什的低语，呼唤他们释放内心的愤怒。另一些在加入近战战斗时感受到格鲁姆什的欢欣，要么与他一同欢呼，要么颤抖着充满恐惧和厌恶。半兽人并非天生邪恶，但邪恶潜伏其中，无论他们是接受还是反抗。",
	"Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion powerfully. Rage doesn't just quicken their pulse, it makes their bodies burn. An insult stings like acid, and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh loudly and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures-feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing-fill their hearts with joy. They tend to be short tempered and sometimes sullen, more inclined to action than contemplation and to fighting than arguing. The most accomplished half-orcs are those with enough self control to get by in a civilized land.": "在格鲁姆什(Gruumsh)的愤怒之外，半兽人强烈地感受情绪。愤怒不仅加快他们的脉搏，还让他们的身体燃烧。一句侮辱像酸一样刺痛，悲伤削弱他们的力量。但他们大声、热烈地笑，简单的肉体快乐——盛宴、饮酒、摔跤、敲鼓和狂野的舞蹈——充满了他们的心。他们往往脾气暴躁，有时阴郁，更倾向于行动而非思考，更喜欢战斗而非争论。最有成就的半兽人是那些有足够自控力在文明社会中生存的人。",
	"Half-orcs usually have names appropriate to the culture in which they were raised. A half-orc who wants to fit in among humans might trade an orc name for a human name. Some half-orcs with human names decide to adopt a guttural orc name because they think it makes them more intimidating.": "半兽人通常有符合其成长文化的名字。一个想要融入人类社会的半兽人可能会用人类名字取代兽人名字。一些取了人类名字的半兽人决定采用一种喉音浊响的兽人名字，因为他们认为这样会让自己更加令人畏惧。",

And some simply try to be so tough that others just avoid them.": "每个半兽人都会找到一种方式来获得那些憎恶兽人的人的接受。有些人保守，尽量不引人注目。少数人公开展示虔诚和善良（无论这些表现是否真实）。还有一些人则试图变得如此强硬，以至于其他人只能远离他们。",
	"The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.": "大部分(%)半身人的生活目标是家的舒适：一个可以安心安静地安家的地方，远离掠夺性怪物和冲突的军队；一个熊熊燃烧的篝火和丰盛的一餐；美酒和美谈。虽然一些半身人在偏远的农业社区度过一生，但也有一些组成游牧团体，不断地旅行，被开阔的道路和辽阔的地平线吸引，去发现新土地和新人。但即使是这些流浪者也热爱和平、美食、炉火和家，尽管家可能是一辆在泥泞道路上颠簸的马车或漂浮在河流上的筏子。",
	"The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense.

They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.": "矮小的半身人通过避免被注意到，或者如果不行的话，避免冒犯，来在一个充满更大生物的世界中生存下来。他们大约有3英尺高，看起来相对无害，因此在帝国的阴影下和战争及政治冲突的边缘上生存了几个世纪。他们倾向于健壮，体重在40到45磅之间。",
	"Halflings' skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.": "半身人的皮肤颜色从棕褐到苍白不等，带有红润的色调，他们的头发通常是棕色或沙棕色的，而且是波浪状的。他们有褐色或者淡褐色的眼睛。半身人男性通常留着长长的连鬓胡子，但胡须在他们中间很罕见，光须更是如此。他们喜欢穿着简单、舒适和实用的衣服，偏爱明亮的颜色。",
	"Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They're concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.": "半身人的实用主义不仅体现在他们的服装上。他们关心基本需求和简单的快乐，对炫耀毫无兴趣。即使是最富有的半身人也更愿意把财宝锁在地窖里，而不是公开展示。他们擅长找到问题的最直接解决方案，对拖延毫无耐心。",
	"Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold or glory.

	"The most diplomatic and good natured of all the humblefolk, hedges like to live quiet lives in villages throughout the Wood, or within the safety of birdfolk perches. They resemble hedgehogs, although the quills that cover their backs are far tougher, hard enough to repel blades and sharp enough to pierce the solid hides of monstrous creatures. Despite their sturdiness, hedges are sensitive and emotional creatures, who display meekness more than bravado. Their meek demeanor and deference in social situations has earned them a reputation as cowards in the eyes of outsiders. But rather than being born of cowardice, their behaviour stems from a desire to respect the feelings and sensitivities of others, something considered to be of utmost importance in hedge society.": "在伍德(Wood)中，生活在村庄里或者鸟人栖息地的世俗民族中，树篱(Hedges)是最外交和善良的。它们类似刺猬，尽管覆盖背部的刺比较坚硬，足以抵御刀剑，锋利到可以刺穿巨兽的坚硬皮肤。尽管它们坚固，树篱是敏感且情感丰富的生物，更多地展现温顺而非虚张声势。它们在社交场合中的温顺和顺从赢得了外界视其为懦夫的声誉。但与其说是出于懦弱，它们的行为更多源自于尊重他人的感受和敏感，这在树篱社会被认为是至关重要的。",
	"Hedges have an incredible capacity for empathy, and tend to view all creatures, from the smallest beetle to the largest beast, as being equally deserving of respect and dignity. They are known across the Wood for being excellent conflict mediators, and usually find themselves acting as diplomats or emissaries between factions trying to broker an agreement.": "树篱具有令人难以置信的同理心，倾向于将所有生物，从最小的甲虫到最大的野兽，视为同等值得尊重和尊严的存在。它们在森林中以出色的冲突调停者而闻名，通常发现自己充当外交官或使者，试图在各方之间斡旋达成协议。",
	"Hedges feel most at home when everyone gets along. They are one of the few races who truly understand that conflict is not an evil force but simply represents an imbalance which must be resolved. This is not to say that hedges have never known strife, only that their proactive approach to mediation, coupled with their deep respect for the dignity of all living creatures, results in fewer occasions for conflict. Yet, when a serious conflict does arise, hedges who feel they have been truly and deeply wronged can close themselves off from the rest of their society, sometimes resulting in splits in a community.": "当每个人都和睦相处时，树篱（Hedges）感觉最自在。他们是少数真正理解冲突并非邪恶力量，而只是需要解决的不平衡的种族之一。这并不是说树篱从未经历过冲突，只是他们积极的调解方法，加上对所有生物尊严的深刻尊重，使冲突发生的机会更少。然而，当严重冲突出现时，感到受到真正和深刻伤害的树篱可能会与社会其他成员疏远，有时导致社区分裂。",
	"One of the reasons hedges display such deep empathy and compassion towards others is due to the intensity of the emotions they feel. The strength of these emotions applies as much to positive feelings it does negative, meaning emotional wounds run deep with hedges.": "树篱精灵对他人表现出如此深刻的同情和同理心的原因之一，是因为他们所感受到的情绪强度。这些情绪的强烈程度不仅适用于积极的感受，也适用于消极的感受，这意味着情感伤痕在树篱精灵心中深深刻下烙印。",
	"Gifted with a unique connection to the Great Rhythm, hedges are tied into the natural world in a fashion similar to the connection possessed by some gallus. This has granted hedges special magical gifts, such as the ability to speak with the smallest ground-dwelling creatures in the Wood, and the power to cause flowers to bloom. It is quite common for hedges to have a variety of animal friends who share their home.": "天赋与大节奏的独特联系，(hedges) 与自然界紧密相连，类似于一些(gallus) 所拥有的联系。这使得(hedges) 获得了特殊的魔法天赋，比如与(Wood) 中最小的地面生物交谈的能力，以及让花朵开放的力量。很常见(hedges) 拥有各种动物朋友与他们共享家园。",
	"Hedges who dwell outside of the birdfolk cities prefer to live in individual burrows under the great roots of trees. Communities of hedges enjoy living surrounded by nature, near clearings within the forest or lone copses. Central meeting areas and communal gardens can be constructed in the spaces between burrows. Hedges love gardening, and tend to keep a few small gardens wherever they live.": "居住在鸟人城市外的刺篱（(`Hedges`)）更喜欢住在大树根下的独立洞穴中。刺篱社区喜欢生活在被大自然环绕的地方，靠近森林中的空地或独立小树林。在洞穴之间的空地上可以建造中央聚会区和公共花园。刺篱热爱园艺，并倾向于在他们居住的地方保留几个小花园。",
	"Hedges need special consideration when wearing clothes, and favor loose tunics, baggy trousers, flowing robes, and other clothes which fit easily over their quills. When not actively flared out, these tough quills naturally flatten, becoming smooth to the touch. However, if suddenly frightened, their quills reflexively flare out and stiffen, an accident which can ruin a hedge's clothing.": "当穿衣服时，刺猬需要特别注意，喜欢宽松的束腰外衣，宽松的裤子，流畅的长袍和其他容易穿过它们的刺的衣服。当不被激怒时，这些坚硬的刺会自然变平，触摸起来很光滑。然而，如果突然受到惊吓，它们的刺会自动竖起并变硬，这种意外可能会毁掉刺猬的衣服。",
	"Adventuring clothes made specifically for hedges are available in nearly every major city in Humblewood, and tailors throughout the Wood are familiar with making alterations to suit a hedge's needs.": "在Humblewood的几乎每个主要城市都可以找到专门为树篱而制作的冒险服装，整个森林中的裁缝都熟悉为树篱的需求进行改装。",
	"Where wishing fails, ancient magic can offer a heart's desire—at least, for a time. Hexbloods are individuals infused with eldritch magic, fey energy, or mysterious witchcraft. Some who enter into bargains with hags gain their deepest wishes but eventually find themselves transformed. These changes evidence a hag's influence: ears that split in forked points, skin in lurid shades, long hair that regrows if cut, and an irremovable living crown. Along with these marks, hexbloods manifest hag-like traits, such as {@sense darkvision} and a variety of magical methods to beguile the senses and avoid the same.": "在当愿望无法实现时，古老的魔法可以提供一颗心的渴望——至少是暂时的。血妖(`Hexbloods`)是被注入了奥术魔法、精灵能量或神秘巫术的个体。一些与女巫(`hags`)达成交易的人获得了他们最深的愿望，但最终发现自己发生了变化。这些变化显示了女巫的影响：耳朵分叉成叉状、皮肤呈鲜艳的色彩、长发如果被剪掉会重新生长，以及一顶无法移除的活生生的王冠。除了这些标记，血妖还表现出女巫般的特征，比如{@sense darkvision}，以及各种魔法手段来迷惑感官并避免同样的命运。",
	"While many hexbloods gain their lineage after making a deal with a hag, others reveal their nature as they age—particularly if a hag influenced them early in life or even before their birth. Many hexbloods turn to lives of adventure, seeking to discover the mysteries of their magic, to forge a connection with their fey natures, or to avoid a hag that obsesses over them.": "虽然许多（%num%）血统者是通过与（hag）女巫达成交易获得他们的血统，但也有一些人随着年龄增长逐渐显露出他们的本性——尤其是如果（hag）女巫在他们年幼时甚至在他们出生前就对他们产生了影响。许多（%num%）血统者选择冒险的生活，寻求发现他们魔法的奥秘，建立与自己仙灵本质的联系，或是避开一个对他们着迷的（hag）女巫。",
	"One way hags create more of their kind is through the creation of hexbloods. Every hexblood exhibits features suggestive of the hag whose magic inspires their powers. This includes an unusual crown, often called an eldercross or a witch's turn. This living, garland-like part of a hexblood's body extends from their temples and wraps behind the head, serving as a visible mark of the bargain between hag and hexblood, a debt owed, or a change to come.": "巫婆们创造更多同类的一种方式是通过创造魔婴(hag)。每个魔婴都展示出与激发他们力量的巫婆相似的特征。这包括一顶不寻常的头冠，通常被称为长者十字架或女巫之轮。这种生物般的部分从魔婴的太阳穴延伸出来，环绕在头后，作为巫婆和魔婴之间交易的可见标记，一种欠债，或者即将到来的改变。",
	"A bargain with a hag or other eerie forces transformed your character into a magical being. Roll on or choose an option from the Hexblood Origins table to determine how your character gained their lineage.": "与一个女巫或其他神秘力量达成交易，将你的角色转变为一个魔法生物。在《女巫血统起源》表中投掷骰子或选择一个选项，以确定你的角色如何获得他们的血统。",

	"Hobgoblins trace their origins to the ancient courts of the Feywild, where they first appeared with their goblin and bugbear kin. Many of them were driven from the Feywild by the conquering god Maglubiyet, who marshaled them as soldiers, but the fey realm left its mark; wherever they are in the multiverse, they continue to channel an aspect of the Feywild's rule of reciprocity, which creates a mystical bond between the giver and the receiver of a gift.": "半兽人的起源可以追溯到古老的仙境法庭，那里他们与地精和大蛮人族群首次出现。许多半兽人被征服神玛格鲁比耶赶出了仙境，他将他们编为士兵，但仙境留下了痕迹；无论身处多元宇宙的何处，他们仍然延续着仙境互惠法则的一面，这创造了赠与者和接受者之间的神秘联系。",
	"On some worlds, such bonds lead hobgoblins to form communities with deep ties to one another. In Eberron and the Forgotten Realms, vast hobgoblin legions have emerged, with ranks of devoted soldiers famed for their unity.": "在一些世界上，这种纽带导致半兽人组建起彼此深厚联系的社区。在(Eberron)和(Forgotten Realms)中，庞大的半兽人军团已经出现，拥有一群以团结著称的忠诚士兵。",

	"In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that's why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.": "在大多数世界的计算中，人类是普通种族中最年轻的，晚来到世界舞台上，并且与矮人、精灵和龙相比寿命短暂。也许正是因为他们的寿命较短，他们才努力在有限的岁月里取得尽可能多的成就。或许他们觉得自己有什么东西要向长者种族证明，这就是为什么他们在征服和贸易的基础上建立强大帝国的原因。无论是什么驱使着他们，人类都是世界的创新者、实现者和先驱者。",
	"With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.": "由于他们对迁徙和征服的偏好，人类在身体上比其他常见种族更加多样化。没有典型的人类。一个人可以高达5英尺到略高于6英尺，体重从125到250磅不等。人类的皮肤颜色从几乎黑色到非常苍白不等，头发颜色从黑色到金色（卷曲、卷曲或直发）不等；男性可能留有稀疏或浓密的胡须。许多人类有一点非人类血统，展现出一些精灵、兽人或其他血统的线索。人类在青少年晚期达到成年，并很少活过一个世纪。",
	"Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human's memory. They live fully in the present-making them well suited to the adventuring life-but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.": "人类是普通种族中最适应和雄心勃勃的人。他们在许多不同的土地上定居时，有着广泛不同的品味、道德和习俗。然而，一旦他们定居，他们就会留下：他们建造可以持续几个世纪的城市和伟大的王国。一个人类个体可能有相对较短的寿命，但一个人类国家或文化保存着远远超出任何单个人记忆范围的传统。他们充分地活在当下-这使他们非常适合冒险生活-但也为未来做计划，努力留下持久的遗产。作为个体和群体，人类是适应性强的机会主义者，他们时刻警惕着不断变化的政治和社会动态。",
	"Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsibility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. While dwarf clans and halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human temples, governments, libraries, and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to escape death's clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they are gone.": "在当地语言习惯的基础上，一个单独的(elf)精灵或(elf)矮人可能会承担起守护特殊地点或强大秘密的责任，而人类则为此目的建立了神圣的秩序和机构。虽然矮人氏族和(halfling)半身人长者将古老传统传承给每一代新人，人类的寺庙、政府、图书馆和法典将他们的传统牢牢地固定在历史的基石上。人类梦想永生，但（除了那些寻求不死或神圣升华以逃离死亡魔爪的少数人外），他们通过确保自己在离去后仍会被记住来实现这一梦想。",

	"Of the five humanoid races of Amonkhet, humans are the most diverse and adaptable. Different humans train in a wide variety of fighting styles, including those particularly favored by other races. A human mage might use any of the five colors of mana, while mages of other races focus on one of only two colors. Human {@background vizier|PSA|viziers} serve all five gods, and different human {@background initiate|PSA|initiates} excel in different trials. Humans defy trends and categorization, and opponents who face a human in one-on-one combat can't know what kind of fight to expect—from the foresight and cunning often associated with Kefnet, to a ruthlessness that emulates Bontu. At the beginning of such a fight, this uncertainty can give an edge to the human combatant.": "在阿蒙凯特的五个人形种族中，人类是最多样化和适应性最强的。不同的人类接受各种各样的战斗风格训练，包括其他种族特别青睐的风格。一个人类法师可能使用五种颜色的魔力，而其他种族的法师则专注于其中的两种颜色。人类{@background vizier|PSA|viziers}事奉所有五位神明，不同的人类{@background initiate|PSA|initiates}在不同的试炼中表现出色。人类违背了趋势和分类，面对一对一战斗的对手无法预料会遇到什么样的战斗——从常与凯夫涅特（Kefnet）联系在一起的先见之明和狡诈，到模仿邦图（Bontu）的无情。在这样的战斗开始时，这种不确定性可能会给予人类战斗者优势。",

	"Humans who choose a path of specialization often piously identify with one of the five gods (often as a {@background vizier|PSA}), and thus focus on one aspect of perfection.

An {@background initiate|PSA} dedicated to Oketra, on the other hand, relies on cooperation, solidarity, and teamwork to get through the trials—even Bontu's Trial of Ambition, which attempts to break down such bonds. To Oketra's disciple, ambition means a drive to help an entire crop of initiates achieve glory together, rather than exalting oneself over others. Humans with this viewpoint see their chosen virtue coloring all others, and believe that the five gods offer their people a choice of which virtue to emulate and emphasize.": "选择专业化道路的人通常会虔诚地认同五位神祇中的一位（通常作为{@background vizier|PSA}），因此专注于完美的某一个方面。对于他们来说，赢得来世的位置的最佳方式就是将自己性格的某一方面磨练到极致，作为{@background initiate|PSA|initiates}，他们希望将这种品质运用在所有五次试炼中。一个认同哈佐瑞特的法师（Mage）可能会将狂热培养到超越其他美德的地步，掌握火焰魔法的咒语来引导这种强大的情感，并依靠原始的能量和热情度过通往哈佐瑞特最终考验的四次试炼。另一方面，致力于奥凯特拉的{@background initiate|PSA}则依靠合作、团结和团队合作来度过试炼，甚至包括试图破坏这种联系的邦图的野心之试。对于奥凯特拉的信徒来说，野心意味着努力帮助整个新生群体一起取得荣耀，而不是凌驾于他人之上。持有这种观点的人认为他们选择的美德会影响其他所有美德，并相信这五位神祇为他们的子民提供了选择要模仿和强调哪种美德的机会。",
	"Other humans believe that true perfection lies in mastering all the virtues, without giving preference to any one over the others. They compare themselves to multifaceted stones whose beauty lies in the polished perfection of every facet. These humans are careful not to let their skills in one area outshine their other efforts, and if they grow too accomplished in one set of skills, they set it aside to concentrate their training on others until their abilities are in balance once more.": "其他人类相信真正的完美在于掌握所有美德，而不偏袒其中任何一个。他们将自己比作多面的宝石，其美丽在于每一面的完美打磨。这些人小心翼翼，不让自己在某一领域的技能超越其他努力，如果他们在某一技能上变得太过优秀，他们会将其搁置，集中精力训练其他技能，直到他们的能力再次平衡。",
	"Philosophically, such humans believe that the gods are five in number so as to remind the people of Amonkhet not to focus their attention on a single god or a single virtue, but to serve the gods equally and master their teachings to the same degree.

	"Some humans, however, apply the idea of perfection through balance to these combat specializations as well, fusing multiple styles together into a unique blend. For example, a human {@background initiate|PSA} might use spells to shape sand into a sword or to wreathe arrows with life-draining magic. Other {@background initiate|PSA|initiates} strike with an axe in one hand while throwing smaller axes with the other, employing techniques of both hand-to-hand and long-range combat. Some humans use slings to launch fireballs, create illusory nets to restrain their opponents, or craft their blades from solid toxins.": "然而，一些人类也将平衡的完美理念应用到这些战斗专长中，将多种风格融合成独特的组合。例如，一个人类{@background initiate|PSA}可能会使用法术将沙子变成剑，或者用生命吸取魔法给箭矢笼罩。其他{@background initiate|PSA|initiates}一手持斧头砍击，一手投掷小斧头，融合近身格斗和远程战斗技巧。一些人类使用弹弓发射火球，制造虚幻网困住对手，或者用固体毒素打造武器。",

Although most plasmoids are translucent gray, they can alter their color and translucence by absorbing dyes through their pores.": "等离子体生物是没有典型形状的无定形生物。在其他生物的陪伴下，它们通常会采取类似的形状，但几乎不会被误认为是其他生物。它们通过渗透作用摄取食物，就像变形虫一样，并通过微小的孔隙排泄废物。它们通过另一组孔隙吸收氧气呼吸，它们的四肢强壮而灵活，足以抓握和操作武器和工具。虽然大多数等离子体生物是半透明的灰色，但它们可以通过孔隙吸收染料来改变自己的颜色和透明度。",
	"Plasmoids don't have internal organs of the usual sort. Their bodies are composed of cells, fibers, plasma-like ooze, and clusters of nerves. These nerves enable a plasmoid to detect light, heat, texture, sound, pain, and vibrations. Plasmoids can stiffen the outer layers of their bodies to maintain a humanlike shape, so they can wear clothing and accessories. They speak by forcing air out of tubular cavities that constrict to produce sound.": "等离子体生物没有通常意义上的内脏器官。它们的身体由细胞、纤维、类似等离子体的黏液和神经团簇组成。这些神经使得等离子体能够感知光线、热量、质地、声音、疼痛和振动。等离子体可以使身体的外层变硬，以保持类似人类的形状，这样它们就可以穿衣服和配饰。它们通过迫使空气从收缩以产生声音的管状腔道中排出来说话。",
	"When plasmoids sleep, they lose their rigidity and spread out and are thus sometimes mistaken for a rock or some other feature of the environment.": "当等离子体生物休眠时，它们失去了刚性，扩散开来，因此有时会被误认为是岩石或环境中的其他特征。",
	"When the birdfolk think of hunters or rangers, they picture a raptor. Resembling small hawks, eagles, and other birds of prey, they have sharp talons and agile builds that help them effortlessly glide through the canopy. These birdfolk are swift and strong with an uncanny knack for tracking. They are rarely prey, and are quick to turn the tables when finding themselves hunted.": "当鸟人想到猎人或游侠时，他们会想到猛禽。类似小鹰、雕鹰和其他猛禽鸟类，它们有锋利的爪子和敏捷的身体结构，帮助它们在树冠间轻松滑翔。这些鸟人迅捷而强壮，具有出色的追踪能力。它们很少成为猎物，一旦发现自己被猎，它们会迅速扭转局面。",
	"Given their heightened senses, often raptors appear to be distracted or deep in thought. In reality, they are processing the wealth of sensory information they receive from their particularly keen eyes and sensitive ears. While many folk are only ever aware of what goes on directly around them, raptors have an extremely wide field of awareness.": "鉴于它们敏锐的感官，猛禽经常看起来分心或陷入沉思。实际上，它们正在处理从特别敏锐的眼睛和敏感的耳朵接收到的大量感官信息。许多人只关注身边发生的事情，而猛禽拥有极为广阔的感知范围。",
	"Raptors are adept at living off the land. They are skilled hunters, usually leading the harvesting of meat and skins for their perches. Raptors are especially well versed in stalking prey from great heights, lining up impossible shots that their prey could not predict.": "猛禽擅长依赖大地生存。它们是熟练的猎手，通常带头收获肉类和皮革用于它们的栖息地。猛禽尤其擅长从高处悄悄接近猎物，准备着对猎物来说难以预料的攻击。",
	"While many of the birdfolk races are culturally communal, raptors don't have a great sense of connectedness, nor do they tend to create their own perches. They are more likely to adopt a transient lifestyle, moving from perch to perch, or to simply live in the vast forests of the Wood itself.": "虽然许多鸟类种族在文化上是共同体的，猛禽们并没有很强的归属感，也不倾向于建立自己的栖息地。它们更有可能采取一种流动的生活方式，从一个栖息地到另一个栖息地迁徙，或者简单地生活在《木之森》的广袤森林中。",
	"Though typically quiet, raptors are not averse to forming relationships with other birdfolk. Despite their reserved nature, raptors value personal bonds more highly than societal or even familial ties.": "尽管通常沉默寡言，猛禽并不排斥与其他鸟人建立关系。尽管它们性格内向，猛禽更看重个人关系，甚于社会甚至家庭纽带。",
	"As a maran raptor, you are as at home in the water as you are in the trees. You also have a wealth of patience, acting only when it best suits your goals.": "作为一只马兰猛禽，你在水中和树上都能游刃有余。你拥有丰富的耐心，只有在最适合实现目标时才会行动。",
	"As a mistral raptor, you are most at home far from the ground. You can range for miles in the Wood without ever setting talon to soil, moving more confidently through the branches than some move on flat ground.": "作为一只(`mistral raptor`)，你最擅长远离地面。你可以在(`Wood`)中漫游数英里，从不将爪子着地，比一些人在平地上行走更自信地穿行于树枝之间。",
	"Most satyrs believe that the other peoples of Theros are woefully burdened with the plague of seriousness. Satyrs scoff at the efforts of polis-builders with their laws and right angles, and they poke fun at philosophers with their endless theories and interminable discourse.

	"Shifters are similar to humans in height and build but are typically more lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes and pointed ears; most shifters also have prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies. While a shifter's appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral.": "变形者在身高和体型上与人类相似，但通常更为纤瘦和灵活。他们的面部特征带有一种野兽般的气质，通常有着大眼睛和尖耳朵；大多数变形者也有突出的犬齿。他们几乎在身体的每个部位长着类似毛发的头发。尽管变形者的外表可能让旁观者想起动物，但即使在最野性化的状态下，他们仍然可以清晰地被识别为变形者。",

	"Longtooth shifters are fierce and aggressive, but they form deep bonds with their friends. Many longtooth shifters have canine traits that become more pronounced as they shift, but they might instead draw on tigers, hyenas, or other predators.": "长牙变形者是凶猛而具侵略性的，但他们与朋友之间建立起深厚的纽带。许多长牙变形者在变形时会展现出犬科动物的特征，但也有可能会选择老虎、鬣狗或其他猛兽的特征。",

	"The Simic Combine uses magic to fuse different life forms together.

	"Sirens are at home along the waters of the Stormwreck Sea. They settle on rocky coasts and remote islands, and even on floating piles of kelp. Sirens are mercurial creatures who can turn in an instant from lonely to repulsed, from desirous to hateful, from welcoming to irritated, from loving to murderous—and then back again. They are fascinated with ships, and enjoy toying with them. One siren might call out to a passing crew for company, only to capriciously draw the ship into an entangling mass of kelp. Another might lure a vessel onto jagged rocks so as to study the wreckage and learn more about the strange contraption. But as the number of Brazen Coalition ships passing through siren-controlled waters has increased over the years, a growing number of sirens have decided to satisfy their curiosity by taking positions on ship crews—including, in at least one case, the position of captain.": "在风暴残破海域的水边，海妖们在家中。它们栖息在岩石海岸和偏远岛屿上，甚至漂浮在海藻堆上。海妖是善变的生物，能在一瞬间从孤独变为厌恶，从渴望变为憎恨，从欢迎变为恼怒，从爱变为杀意，然后再次转变。它们对船只着迷，喜欢戏弄它们。一只海妖可能会呼唤经过的船员作伴，只是随意地将船拖入一团缠结的海藻中。另一只可能会引诱一艘船驶向锯齿状的岩石，以便研究残骸并了解更多关于这种奇怪装置的信息。但随着多年来穿越海妖控制水域的无畏联盟船只数量的增加，越来越多的海妖决定通过加入船员的方式满足他们的好奇心，其中至少有一例是担任船长的位置。",

Their fingers bear sharp claws but are nimble enough to wield weapons and perform fine manipulation. Crests of feathery plumage start between their eyes and cover the backs of their heads.": "塞壬是拥有鸟类特征的人形生物。它们修长的手臂延伸成强大的翅膀，轻松地将它们的纤细身躯带入空中。它们的手指带有锋利的爪子，但灵活到可以挥舞武器和进行精细操作。羽毛状的冠羽从它们的眼睛之间开始，覆盖着头部背面。",
	"Strigs are the most imposing of the birdfolk races. Resembling owls, their thick feathers, solid bodies, and broad wings have earned them a reputation as the most powerful of the birdfolk races.

They have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors black, red, white, silver, or gold with no visible sclera or pupil.

The reality, though, is that a tiefling's bloodline doesn't affect his or her personality to any great degree. Years of dealing with mistrust does leave its mark on most tieflings, and they respond to it in different ways. Some choose to live up to the wicked stereotype, but others are virtuous. Most are simply very aware of how people respond to them.

It leaves the place of its birth and finds its own corner of the wilderness in which to hunt, catch fish, and get by. With each passing year, a tortle hones its survival skills.

The parents spend the remainder of their lives guarding the compound, defending their offspring, and sharing a lifetime of knowledge before they die. When the children are old enough to leave the compound, they pick up whatever weapons and tools their parents left behind and set out on their own.": "当一只龟人接近自然寿命的尽头时，它会寻找一个伴侣并繁殖后代。龟人会在一个由石墙围起来的设防场地里产卵（数量从一到十二不等）。如果没有这样的场地，它们会自己建造一个。父母会在余生中守护这个场地，保卫后代，并在死前分享一生的知识。当孩子们长大到可以离开场地时，它们会拿起父母留下的武器和工具，然后自己出发。",
	"Tortles don't have their own pantheon of gods, but they often worship the gods of other races. It's not unusual for a tortle to hear stories or legends related to a god and choose to worship that deity. In the Forgotten Realms, tortles are especially fond of Eldath, Gond, Lathander, Savras, Selûne, and Tymora. In the Greyhawk setting, they gravitate toward Celestian, Fharlanghn, Pelor, Pholtus, and St. Cuthbert. Tortles are often drawn to the Gods of Good in Dragonlance and the Sovereign Host in Eberron.

	"Tortles have a saying: \"We wear our homes on our backs.\" The shells they carry around provide all the shelter they require. Consequently, tortles don't feel the need to root themselves in one place for too long. A tortle settlement is primarily used as a kind of moot, where tortles can socialize with one another, share useful information, and trade with strangers in the safety of greater numbers. Tortles don't regard these settlements as places worth defending with their lives, and they will abandon a settlement when it no longer serves their needs.": "龟人有句谚语：“我们的家就在背上。” 它们背负的壳提供了它们所需的所有庇护。因此，龟人不觉得有必要在一个地方扎根太久。龟人定居点主要用作一种集会场所，龟人可以在那里与彼此社交，分享有用信息，并在更多人的安全环境中与陌生人交易。龟人不认为这些定居点值得用生命来捍卫，当定居点不再满足它们的需求时，它们会放弃这些定居点。",

The urge to procreate doesn't kick in until the end of a tortle's life, and a tortle can spend decades away from its native land without feeling homesick.": "大多数龟裂喜欢了解其他生物的生活方式，发现新的习俗和新的做事方式。直到龟裂生命的尽头，繁殖的冲动才会出现，一只龟裂可以在没有思乡之情的情况下度过数十年远离自己的故土。",
	"Tortles embrace a simple view of the world. It is a place of wonder, and tortles see beauty in the ordinary. They live for the chance to hear a soft wind blowing through palm trees, to watch a frog croaking on a lily pad, or to stand in a crowded human marketplace.": "龟人对世界有着简单的看法。这是一个充满奇迹的地方，他们从平凡中看到美丽。他们活着就是为了能听到微风拂过棕榈树的声音，看着青蛙在荷叶上呱呱作响，或者站在拥挤的人类市场中。",
	"Tortles like to learn new skills. They craft their own tools and weapons, and they are good at building structures and fortifications.

	"For centuries, dryfolk have fished the seas of Theros and have used the sea's surface as a means of travel. Many tritons interpret this as an intrusion into their domains.

Enchanted by the feeling of the winds, the rustle of leaves, the ingenuity of land-dwelling inventors, or any of countless other surface-world charms, every triton living beyond the waves does so for their own reasons.

All that Dalakos knew was destroyed, obliterated by the might of the kraken.": "达拉科斯认为自己和其他海妖一样——好奇、头脑敏捷，甚至可能被众神赋予了非凡的聪明才智。但他缺乏集中精力，容易分心，他的潜力就像洒在石头上的种子一样四散。直到一只海怪从海洋最深处升起，开始肆虐，威胁到达拉科斯的社区，他才被迫集中注意力。随着怪兽越来越接近，达拉科斯寻找方法转移这个怪物的路径。他日夜努力工作，但最终他的计划失败了。达拉科斯所知道的一切都被这只海怪的力量摧毁，被彻底毁灭了。",

	"A triton's name is a symbol of choice. Upon reaching adulthood, a triton might shed the name they were given by their parents for one of their own choosing. Some opt to keep their name, but the majority select one that represents the adult they've become. Tritons might even go on to choose yet other names, as they shift from one phase of life to another, or after significant life events. Leaving a home community or transitioning to live among dryfolk might constitute such life changes. Tritons also have a fluid concept of gender and might switch names freely as they shift gender identities.": "一个海底精灵的名字是一种选择的象征。当海底精灵成年时，他们可能会放弃父母给予的名字，选择一个自己喜欢的名字。一些人选择保留原来的名字，但大多数会选择一个代表他们成年后的名字。海底精灵甚至可能会在生命的不同阶段选择不同的名字，或者在重要的生活事件之后选择新的名字。离开家乡社区或过渡到干燥人群中生活可能构成这样的生活变化。海底精灵对性别的概念也很灵活，可能会在性别认同转变时自由更换名字。",

	"Centuries ago, tritons entered the world in response to the growing threat of evil elementals. Tritons waged many wars against their enemies on the Plane of Water, driving them into the Darkened Depths where they escaped into the crushing pressure and utter darkness. In time, the tritons noticed that their ancient elemental foes had grown quiet. Expeditions to the depths revealed that krakens, sahuagin, and far worse foes had fled the Plane of Water for the Material Plane.": "数个世纪前，(tritons) 为了应对邪恶元素生物的威胁而进入这个世界。(Tritons) 在水之位面上与敌人进行了许多战争，将他们驱逐到黑暗深渊中，在那里逃脱了巨大的压力和彻底的黑暗。随着时间的推移，(tritons) 注意到他们古老的元素敌人变得安静了。深入探险发现，(krakens)、(sahuagin) 和更可怕的敌人已经逃离水之位面，前往物质位面。",
	"The tritons, driven by a sense of duty and responsibility, would not allow their foes to escape so easily. A great conclave of tritons chose volunteers skilled in weapons and magic as part of an expeditionary force to enter the Material Plane and seek out their enemies.": "海底人，出于一种责任感和使命感，不会让他们的敌人轻易逃脱。一大批海底人选择了擅长武器和魔法的志愿者，作为一支远征部队，进入物质位面，寻找他们的敌人。",
	"Those tritons spread across the world's oceans and established protectorates to watch over deep sea trenches, portals, undersea caves, and other locations where their enemies might lurk. They defeated their foes when they found them and drove the rest into hiding.": "那些(特里顿)遍布世界各大洋，并建立了保护区，以监视深海海沟、传送门、海底洞穴和其他敌人可能潜伏的地点。他们发现敌人后将其击败，并迫使其余的敌人躲藏起来。",
	"With their foes banished to the deepest reaches of the sea, tritons settled in to watch for any sign of their return. Over time, the tritons extended their stewardship over the sea floor from their initial settlements and built outposts to create trade with other races. Despite this expansion, few folk know of them. Their settlements are so remote even merfolk and sea elves rarely encounter them.": "当他们的敌人被放逐到海洋最深处后，(tritons) 天人们安定下来，开始观察是否有任何回归的迹象。随着时间的推移，(tritons) 天人们将他们对海底的管理从最初的定居点扩展开来，并建立了前哨站，与其他种族进行贸易。尽管有这种扩张，很少有人知道他们。他们的定居点如此偏远，甚至美人鱼和海精灵也很少遇到他们。",
	"As a result of their isolation and limited understanding of the Material Plane, tritons can come across as haughty and arrogant. They see themselves as caretakers of the sea, and they expect other creatures to pay them deep respect, if not complete deference.": "由于他们与外界隔绝并对物质位面了解有限，海底精灵可能会显得傲慢自大。他们视自己为海洋的守护者，期望其他生物对他们表示深切尊重，甚至完全顺从。",
	"This attitude might grate on others, but it arises from a seed of truth. Few know of the tritons' great victories over dreadful undersea threats. The tritons make little allowance for such ignorance and are delighted to expound upon the great debt others owe them.": "这种态度可能会让其他人感到不悦，但它源自一颗真理的种子。很少有人知道(Tritions)对可怕的海底威胁取得的伟大胜利。(Tritons)对这种无知几乎没有什么容忍，并乐于阐述其他人欠他们的巨大债务。",
	"Tritons also have a tendency to emerge from their isolation under the assumption that other folk will welcome them as respected allies and mentors. Again, distance drives much of this attitude. The tritons' limited view of the world leaves them ignorant of the kingdoms, wars, and other struggles of the surface world. Tritons readily see such concerns as minor events, a sideshow to the tritons' role as the world's true protectors.": "特里顿人也有一种倾向，他们会从孤立中走出来，以为其他人会欢迎他们作为受尊敬的盟友和导师。再次，距离驱使着这种态度。特里顿人对世界的有限视野使他们对地表世界的王国、战争和其他斗争一无所知。特里顿人很容易将这些问题视为次要事件，只是特里顿人作为世界真正守护者的角色的附带表演。",
	"Despite their off-putting manners, tritons are benevolent creatures at heart, convinced that other civilized races deserve their protection. Their attitude might grate, but when pirate fleets prowl the waves or a kraken awakens from its slumber, they are among the first to take up arms to protect others.": "尽管他们的举止令人反感，但海底精灵(tritons)本质上是善良的生物，坚信其他文明种族应该得到他们的保护。他们的态度可能让人不悦，但当海盗舰队在海域游荡或者巨型章鱼从沉睡中苏醒时，他们总是第一时间拿起武器保护他人。",
	"Tritons readily sacrifice themselves for the common good. They will fight and die for humans, merfolk, and other creatures without question. Their self-absorbed nature makes them overlook the history of other creatures, but they also endure a sense of guilt over allowing the evils of the Plane of Water to enter the Material Plane and threaten its inhabitants. The tritons believe they owe a debt of honor to the world, and they will fight and die to pay it.": "涡轮人(Tritons)乐意为了共同利益而牺牲自己。他们会毫无疑问地为人类、人鱼和其他生物而战斗，甚至献出生命。他们自我为中心的本性使他们忽视其他生物的历史，但他们也感到内疚，因为他们允许水之位面的邪恶进入物质位面并威胁其居民。涡轮人相信他们欠世界一份荣誉债，他们会为此而战斗，甚至献出生命。",
	"At times their fervor and ignorance of the world can lead them astray. Tritons encountering other creatures for the first time can underestimate them, leaving the tritons vulnerable to deception. With their strong martial tradition, tritons can sometimes be too eager to leap into a fight.": "有时候，他们的热情和对世界的无知会让他们误入歧途。第一次遇到其他生物的海妖可能会低估它们，使得海妖容易受骗。由于他们强大的武术传统，海妖有时会过于急于投入战斗。",

	"Tritons also find the variety of social institutions, kingdoms, and other customs bewildering. For all their proud culture, they remain innocent of the surface world.

	"At its worst, a triton's arrogance compounds the tendency for the triton not to understand the ways of the surface world.": "在最糟糕的情况下，一个（Triton）海底精灵的傲慢加剧了他们不理解地表世界的倾向。",
	"It's easy for a triton to blame baffling social practices on what the triton perceives as the barbarism, weakness, or cowardice of surface folk.": "对于一个涡人来说，很容易将令人困惑的社会习俗归咎于涡人认为地表人的野蛮、软弱或懦弱。",
	"Far from flawless, these champions of good mean well, but they are easily frustrated by others. You can select, roll, or adapt a triton-specific quirk from the Triton Quirks table.

	"Born into ancient servitude and bred to a life of decadent corruption, the vampires of Zendikar feed on the energy in the blood of living creatures—an energy that is particularly strong in times of terror and pain. To members of the other races, vampires are a fearsome mystery and the stuff of nightmares, hunting their prey like beasts or reclining on thrones made of skulls in their moss-draped cities. But few understand how the vampires are locked in a brutal civil war. On one side are those who hold to their traditional ways, desperately battling to remain free. On the other side are those vampires whose legacy reaches back into the deepest recesses of history. Bound once more to the Eldrazi who were their ancient masters, those vampires hunt their kin in an effort to extinguish any dreams of freedom and rebellion.": "生来就是古老奴役的产物，被培养成堕落腐化的生活方式，Zendikar的吸血鬼以活生生的生物血液中的能量为食—这种能量在恐惧和痛苦时尤为强大。对其他种族的成员来说，吸血鬼是一个可怕的谜团和噩梦的源头，它们像野兽一样猎捕猎物，或者斜倚在以骷髅制成的王座上，坐落在被苔藓覆盖的城市中。但很少有人了解吸血鬼是如何陷入残酷内战之中的。一方面是那些坚守传统方式的人，拼命地奋战以保持自由。另一方面是那些吸血鬼，他们的遗产可以追溯到历史最深处。再次被他们古老主人Eldrazi所束缚，这些吸血鬼追捕他们的同类，试图扑灭任何有关自由和反抗的梦想。",
	"Vampires are associated with black mana. Their existence is predicated on draining the life from others to fuel their own existence, and on putting their own lives ahead of all other concerns. Philosophically, they do not constrain themselves with artificial rules of morality, but believe that the strong can and should take what they need from the weak.": "吸血鬼与黑魔法联系在一起。他们的存在建立在吸取他人生命以维持自身存在，并将自己的生命置于所有其他考虑之上。在哲学上，他们不受人为道德规则的约束，相信强者可以并且应该从弱者那里获取他们所需的东西。",
	"The vampires of Zendikar are not undead. Rather, their unique nature comes from an eldritch disease that turns their flesh cold, makes their gray or purple skin feel dead to the touch, and enables them to drain concentrated magical energy from the blood of other living creatures. They are tall and slender, with long, elegant necks and broad shoulders. Bony horns protrude from their shoulders and elbows, often augmented by the layered plates of their armor and clothing. Their canine teeth are slightly elongated, but not enough to protrude between their closed lips.": "Zendikar的吸血鬼并非亡灵。相反，它们的独特本质源自一种古怪的疾病，使它们的肌肤变冷，使它们灰色或紫色的皮肤触感像死物一般，并使它们能够从其他生物的血液中吸取浓缩的魔法能量。它们身材高大修长，颈部修长优雅，肩部宽阔。它们的肩膀和肘部长出骨质角，通常还有盔甲和衣物的层层覆盖。它们的犬齿略微延长，但不足以突出闭合的嘴唇之间。",
	"Vampires dress in leather and the chitin carapaces of the gigantic insects that dwell in the swamps and jungles of their native Guul Draz, augmented with fine silk and gauzy fabric. They decorate their skin in elaborate, symmetrical patterns of red paint made from blood and mineral pigments. Their clothing is an odd mixture of complex layers and elaborate patterns combined with plenty of exposed skin, since their cold bodies are unaffected by the temperature around them.": "吸血鬼穿着皮革和巨大昆虫的外骨骼，这些昆虫栖息在他们的故乡古德拉兹的沼泽和丛林中，再搭配上精美的丝绸和薄纱。他们用由血液和矿物颜料制成的红色涂料，在皮肤上装饰出复杂对称的图案。他们的服装是复杂层次和精美图案的奇特混合，同时暴露出大量皮肤，因为他们冰冷的身体不受周围温度的影响。",
	"The Legion of Dusk is dominated by an aristocratic class made up of vampires. They are faster and stronger than most humans, and gifted with supernatural abilities that made them the most formidable force in their homeland. Now, as they push into the depths of Ixalan in search of the Immortal Sun, they bring this strength to bear against all who would resist their advance.": "黄昏军团由由吸血鬼组成的贵族阶层所主导。他们比大多数人类更快更强壮，并且拥有超自然的能力，使他们成为故乡中最强大的力量。如今，随着他们深入伊克沙兰寻找不朽太阳，他们将这种力量用来对抗一切试图阻挡他们前进的敌人。",
	"For many vampires, the Rite of Redemption that transforms a human into a vampire is an act of personal sacrifice, paving the way for a promised glorious age. These vampires embody Torrezon's noble tradition in Ixalan. They are often guided by their dual loyalties to church and crown, believing that the monarch acts with righteous purpose. As such, these vampires carry themselves with a self-assurance that is both imposing and imperial. Other societies seem inferior and unclean compared to their own, leading them to feel that they have a right to claim new lands despite the presence of people already inhabiting those lands.": "对许多吸血鬼来说，将一个人转变为吸血鬼的救赎仪式是一种个人牺牲的行为，为一个被承诺的辉煌时代铺平道路。这些吸血鬼体现了伊克萨兰（Ixalan）中托雷佐恩（Torrezon）的高贵传统。他们经常受到对教会和王室的双重忠诚的引导，相信君主的行动是正义的。因此，这些吸血鬼表现出一种既令人敬畏又帝国主义的自信态度。与他们自己相比，其他社会似乎是低等和不洁净的，这导致他们认为他们有权利要求新的土地，尽管这些土地已经有人居住。",
	"Other vampires view vampirism merely as a means to attain a powerful advantage over others. These vampires are fierce, ruthless, and often cruel, relishing conflict—be it political or armed—as a means of demonstrating their superiority. Many are politically ambitious, invoking Torrezon's hierarchy when it serves their interests, but ignoring all the rules of church, state, and morality when those rules become a burden. When these vampires come to Ixalan, they are conquerors, motivated by the prospect of personal glory and the accumulation of riches. Those who achieve wealth and power display it ostentatiously.": "其他吸血鬼仅将吸血鬼主义视为获取对他人强大优势的手段。这些吸血鬼凶猛、无情，常常残忍，喜欢冲突——无论是政治上的还是武装的——作为展示他们优越性的手段。许多人在政治上雄心勃勃，只有在符合自身利益时才会援引托雷松（Torrezon）的等级制度，但当这些规则成为负担时，他们会无视教会、国家和道德的一切规则。当这些吸血鬼来到伊克沙兰（Ixalan）时，他们是征服者，受到个人荣耀和财富积累的前景的驱使。那些获得财富和权力的人会炫耀地展示出来。",
	"The core of every vampire's nature is the Feast of Blood. Though it is forbidden to feed on human citizens of Torrezon, including the human sailors and servants who accompany the vampire conquistadors to Ixalan, vampires are encouraged to feed on outsiders and heretics. The Feast of Blood sends new life essence flowing through the vampire who partakes of it, manifesting as even greater strength and speed.": "每个吸血鬼本性的核心是鲜血盛宴。虽然禁止吸食托雷松的人类市民，包括随吸血鬼征服者前往伊克沙兰的人类水手和仆人，但鼓励吸血鬼吸食外来者和异教徒。鲜血盛宴会让吸血鬼体内涌动新的生命精华，表现为更强大和更快的力量。",
	"Nothing is perfect. Vedalken not only believe this fact, they rejoice in it. Every imperfection is a chance for improvement, and progress is an endless march toward a state of perfection that can never be reached. This viewpoint leads vedalken to pursue their work with delighted enthusiasm, never deterred by setbacks and excited by every opportunity for improvement.": "没有什么是完美的。瓦德肯(Vedalken)不仅相信这一事实，他们还因此而感到欣喜。每一个不完美都是改进的机会，进步是通往永远无法达到的完美状态的无尽进程。这种观点使瓦德肯以愉快的热情追求他们的工作，从不被挫折所阻止，并对每一个改进的机会感到兴奋。",
	"Vedalken are tall and slender, standing almost a head taller than humans on average but weighing about the same. Their hairless skin comes in a range of shades of blue. Their eyes are darker shades of blue or violet. They lack external ears, their noses are broad and flat, and they are partially amphibious.": "Vedalken（维达肯）高大修长，平均比人类高出一头，但体重大致相同。他们没有毛发的皮肤呈现出各种蓝色调。他们的眼睛是深蓝色或紫色。他们没有外耳，鼻子宽平，部分是两栖动物。",
	"Despite being talkative, vedalken keep their personal lives private, and they tend to engage more with ideas than with people. They form close friendships based on mutual interests or compelling disagreements, and their interactions dwell on their thoughts about those issues rather than their feelings about them.": "尽管话多，瓦达肯（Vedalken）仍然保持个人生活的隐私，他们更倾向于与思想交流而非与人交流。他们建立在共同兴趣或引人注目的分歧上的亲密友谊，他们的互动更多地关注于对这些问题的思考，而非对它们的感受。",
	"To members of other races, vedalken often seem cold, even emotionless.

Cool rationality guides their actions, they make and follow careful plans, and they are patient enough to do nothing when the ideal outcome relies on such inaction.": "对其他种族的成员来说，(vedalken) 通常显得冷漠，甚至没有情感。这种评估并不公平——他们和其他人一样强烈地感受到情感，但他们擅长不展现出来。冷静的理性指导着他们的行动，他们制定并遵循谨慎的计划，当理想的结果依赖于这种不作为时，他们足够耐心地什么都不做。",
	"Their curious intellects and rational minds incline vedalken toward membership in the Azorius Senate, the Simic Combine, and (less often) the Izzet League.

	"Vedalken believe that the path toward the impossible goal of perfection is paved with bricks of education, careful deliberation, and controlled experimentation. Some vedalken direct their energy toward perfecting themselves, whether by means of Simic bioengineering or through extensive study, and others concentrate on perfecting society through the careful drafting and application of laws.": "瓦达肯(Vedalken)相信通往完美不可能目标的道路是铺满教育、谨慎思考和受控实验的砖石。一些瓦达肯将他们的精力投入到完善自己，无论是通过西米克(Simic)生物工程还是通过深入研究，而其他人则专注于通过精心起草和执行法律来完善社会。",

	"Vedalken have an unusual view of progress. They believe that nothing is perfect, nor can it ever be perfect—and they rejoice in this. Every imperfection is a chance for improvement, and progress is an endless march toward a state of perfection that can never actually be reached. Thus, pointing out imperfection is hardly an insult—which leads vedalken to note flaws and problems with an enthusiasm that members of other races sometimes find exasperating.": "瓦达肯(Vedalken)对进步有着独特的看法。他们相信没有什么是完美的，也永远不可能完美—而他们为此感到欣喜。每一个缺陷都是改进的机会，进步是通向永远无法达到的完美状态的无尽征程。因此，指出缺陷几乎不是一种侮辱—这导致瓦达肯以一种其他种族的成员有时会觉得恼人的热情来指出缺陷和问题。",
	"This enthusiasm extends to every aspect of vedalken work, both practical and theoretical. They are curious and excitable, and often become deeply engrossed in their labors. It's not uncommon for a vedalken to spend hours on end caught up in the details of an abstract question or a minute engineering problem. Vedalken can be utterly oblivious to their surroundings while meditating on thorny issues, and they are prone to launching into lengthy explanations of their current research, since most find that talking about a problem often leads to a solution.": "这种热情延伸到了vedalken工作的各个方面，无论是实践还是理论。他们好奇而兴奋，经常会深陷于他们的工作之中。对于一个抽象问题或微小的工程问题，vedalken花费数小时沉浸在细节中并不罕见。当沉思棘手问题时，vedalken可能会完全忽视周围环境，并倾向于对他们目前的研究进行长时间的解释，因为大多数人发现谈论问题通常会导致解决方案。",
	"As a rule, vedalken are gregarious in conversation. However, they are quite circumspect concerning their personal lives, and they engage more with ideas than with people. They form close friendships based around mutual interests or compelling disagreements, and their interactions focus on their thoughts about those issues rather than their feelings about them. Emotional dynamics don't particularly interest vedalken, either as a conversational topic or a field of study. When they talk about their feelings, it is primarily to provide information that might be helpful to others. For example, a vedalken might tell her colleagues, \"I'm feeling irritated right now, so I might not be reacting appropriately. Perhaps we should continue this later.\" But any questions about the cause of the irritation are likely to be brushed off as being irrelevant to the situation.": "作为一个规则，维达肯(Vedalken)在交谈中是很合群的。然而，他们对于个人生活非常谨慎，更倾向于与思想而非人交流。他们建立在共同兴趣或引人注目的分歧基础上的亲密友谊，他们的互动主要集中在对这些问题的想法，而非对这些问题的感受。情感动态对维达肯来说并不特别有趣，无论是作为谈话话题还是研究领域。当他们谈论自己的感受时，主要是为了提供可能对他人有帮助的信息。例如，一个维达肯可能会告诉她的同事，“我现在感到烦躁，所以我的反应可能不太恰当。也许我们应该稍后继续。”但任何关于烦躁原因的问题可能会被视为与情况无关而被搪塞过去。",
	"Most vedalken care far more about invention and inquiry than about politics. They would rather unlock the hidden potential of aether-based devices than dwell on the question of how aether should be distributed to the Consulate's citizens. For that reason, though vedalken are found both among the officials of the Consulate and among the renegades, their dedication to either cause often lacks the partisan fervor found in the members of other races": "大多数维达肯((vedalken))更关心发明和探究，而不是政治。他们更愿意解锁基于以太的设备的潜力，而不是纠缠于以太应该如何分配给领事馆公民的问题。因此，尽管维达肯在领事馆的官员和叛乱者中都有，但他们对任何一方的奉献往往缺乏其他种族成员所具有的党派狂热。",
	"The verdan owe their existence to chaos. Descended and transformed from a large clan of goblins and hobgoblins, those who became the verdan were simply living their lives, doing goblinoid things. But then passing through the shadow of That-Which-Endures changed them forever. Now the newest race to call Faerûn home, the verdan do their best to find their way in an unfamiliar world.": "绿蓝族（Verdan）的存在源自混沌。他们是由一大群地精和 hobgoblins 后裔转变而来，那些成为绿蓝族的人只是过着他们的生活，做着地精族的事情。但当他们经过永恒之物的阴影时，命运便永远改变了他们。作为法罗恩（Faerûn）的新兴种族，绿蓝族尽力在这个陌生的世界中找到自己的道路。",
	"Reality is a descent into chaos punctuated by brief flashes of order, whence we arose and so imagine it to be the norm rather than a distant outlier.

	"When the power of That-Which-Endures mutated the verdan, their skin was turned the color of jade and their blood began to flow black. Their ears grew pointed, and they gained a limited form of telepathy—but at the cost of forgetting their history. The underground homes of the goblins were places of terror to the new creatures those goblins became, and the verdan quickly fled to the surface and into the sunlight.": "当持续之力变异了翠绿人(verdan)时，他们的皮肤变成了翡翠色，血液开始流淌成黑色。他们的耳朵变尖，获得了一种有限的心灵感应能力——但代价是忘记了他们的历史。对于那些哥布林(goblins)变成的新生物来说，哥布林的地下住所是恐怖之地，翠绿人(verdan)很快逃到地表，躲进阳光下。",
	"When they arrived in the new lands of the surface, the verdan found that they were often mistaken for smaller, green-skinned half-elves. Attracting curiosity but no real questions, they have thus been able to make their way reasonably freely in the world.": "当他们抵达地表的新土地时，绿色人发现他们经常被误认为是更小的、绿皮肤的半精灵。尽管引起了好奇，但并没有受到真正的质疑，因此他们得以在世界上相对自由地行动。",
	"That-Which-Endures is a nameless, faceless, mysterious entity, something between a multiverse-spanning primordial spirit and an over-god. It represents the amoral and all-encompassing power of entropy—the force that unknowingly and uncaringly changes order into chaos, and that breaks matter and time down into its component parts so that all can be rebuilt. Some who study this entity claim that it is clearly evil and destructive. Others call it simply a necessary part of the cycle of death and rebirth. In the end, though, That-Which-Endures shows precious little interest in what people say about it.": "持久者是一个无名、无面、神秘的实体，介于跨越多元宇宙的原始精神和超神之间。它代表着无道德和全包罗性的熵之力量——这种力量无意识地和漠不关心地将秩序变为混沌，将物质和时间分解为其组成部分，以便一切都可以重建。一些研究这个实体的人声称它显然是邪恶和破坏性的。其他人则简单地称其为死亡与重生循环中必不可少的一部分。然而，最终，持久者对人们对它的看法几乎没有任何兴趣。",
	"Because the verdan have not dwelled long in the world, they are still discovering new things about themselves. Chief among these discoveries is that their physical forms change as they age, signifying that the mutative power of That-Which-Endures is not done with them. The first verdan emerged from the Underdark as creatures of goblin stature. But they soon learned that their kind were fated to eventually undergo a dramatic, painful, and random growth spurt that sees them transformed to hobgoblin size over a period of days.": "因为绿人(verdan)在世界上停留的时间不长，他们仍在不断发现关于自己的新事物。其中最重要的发现是，随着年龄增长，他们的身体形态会发生变化，这表明那持续存在的变异力量并未完成对他们的影响。第一批绿人从地底世界(Underdark)出现时，身形如地精一般。但他们很快发现，他们的种族注定会经历一次戏剧性、痛苦且随机的生长突变，使他们在几天内变成鬼鬼怪怪的大小。",
	"At the same time, many verdan undergo changes in coloring as they age. Male verdan typically have little to no hair, while females sport shocks of wiry hair that they try to tame in a variety of styles. But the color of any verdan's hair, skin, and eyes can transform from their original jade tones to pale white, deep ebon, or any other shade in between. A verdan's ears also undergo numerous spontaneous alterations over their lifetime, from the typical range of point and peak seen among the elves, to huge ears that sweep back from the head like wings, and which are often pierced behind the head with a single ring to keep them from flapping about.": "同时，许多翠绿人在变老时会经历颜色上的变化。翠绿男性通常几乎没有头发，而女性则有一撮硬发，她们会尝试用各种方式来驯服它们。但任何翠绿人的头发、皮肤和眼睛的颜色都可以从最初的翡翠色变成淡白色、深黑色或其他任何中间色。翠绿人的耳朵在他们一生中也会经历许多突发的变化，从典型的精灵耳朵的尖和峰范围，到像翅膀一样从头后面向后横扫的巨大耳朵，通常在头后面穿了一个戒指以防止它们摇摆。",
	"Changes in gender are also a known and accepted part of verdan life. These fluid aspects of form and identity are seen as blessings, allowing an individual to experience more of the world and grow in empathy and understanding. There is no pattern to any verdan's mutations, as verdan from the same family can shift in drastically different ways. The verdan assign no cultural or biological relevance to any particular coloration, physical features, or gender.": "性别变化也是(verdan)生活中已知且被接受的一部分。这种形式和身份的流动性被视为一种祝福，使个体能够体验更多世界，并在同理心和理解力上成长。(verdan)的变异没有任何模式，因为来自同一家族的(verdan)可能会以截然不同的方式变化。(verdan)不会将任何特定的色彩、外貌特征或性别赋予文化或生物学上的重要性。",
	"The clan homes of the Underdark goblinoids who became the verdan covered an enormous area. As the verdan fled to the surface world, they emerged in culturally diverse locations. Some found themselves near dwarven strongholds, others near elven enclaves, and others near the widespread human settlements of Faerûn.": "在与地方语言习惯一致的情况下，文本中类似 (%num%) 的内容在翻译中仍应保持为 (%num%)。\n\nUnderdark 哥布林一族的家园成为了 verdan，覆盖了一个巨大的区域。随着 verdan 逃往地表世界，他们出现在文化多样的地点。一些人发现自己靠近矮人要塞，另一些人靠近精灵聚居地，还有一些人靠近 Faerûn 广泛的人类定居点。",
	"Without a cultural identity or memory of their own, the verdan quickly adopted the cultural practices of the areas into which they migrated. Still, a sense of not truly belonging is felt even by verdan who have been welcomed into other cultures. They are often stricken with wanderlust, keeping their possessions limited and easily portable. It is not unusual to see individual verdan or whole families trooping along the roads of the world with their tents and belongings strapped to their backs.": "没有自己的文化身份或记忆，绿蓝人(verdan)迅速地采纳了他们迁徙到的地区的文化习俗。然而，即使是被其他文化欢迎的绿蓝人，也会感到一种不真正归属的感觉。他们经常被一种漫游的冲动所困扰，保留的财产少且容易携带。看到独立的绿蓝人或整个家庭沿着世界的道路行进，背着他们的帐篷和财物并不罕见。",
	"Even when they are happily steeped in a culture, the verdan remain on the lookout for oppression and curtailment of freedoms. They understand the need for laws that protect, but they rail against laws that restrict and oppress—especially those designed to protect the power and wealth of the elite. When living among enlightened folk, verdan are still the first to speak out against cultural restraints on individuals, particularly those based on physical characteristics such as gender, race, or appearance.": "即使他们生活在一个文化中，绿人仍然警惕压迫和剥夺自由。他们理解保护法律的必要性，但他们反对限制和压迫的法律，尤其是那些旨在保护精英权力和财富的法律。即使生活在开明的人群中，绿人仍然是第一个反对文化对个人的限制的人，尤其是那些基于生理特征如性别、种族或外表的限制。",
	"Verdan are hungry to undertake new challenges and absorb new experiences. When they meet other verdan who have traveled to different parts of the world, they drop everything to spend as long as possible sharing stories and observations from their respective travels. However, their inexperience in the world and their racial amnesia sometimes lends the verdan a kind of innocence that works against them. Some are credulous and easily fooled by hucksters, but most verdan have an intuition bred by empathy that helps them eventually sort out those who are sincere from those who are not.": "維丹人渴望接受新挑戰，吸收新經驗。當他們遇到其他維丹人曾遊歷世界不同地方時，他們會立刻放下一切，花盡可能長的時間分享彼此旅行的故事和觀察。然而，他們在世界上的不經驗和種族失憶有時會使維丹人顯得有種天真的特質，這反而對他們不利。有些人輕信他人，容易被江湖騙子所愚弄，但大多數維丹人憑藉同理心所培養的直覺，最終能夠分辨出誰是真誠的，誰是虛偽的。",
	"The oldest verdan names spring from goblinoid traditions, but more recent names reflect the character of the different cultures these folk have encountered since coming out into the sunlight. When a group of verdan live near dwarves, they might take on more dwarven-sounding names, only to change those names when they wander into a human area. A verdan is also not hesitant to change their name as their physical appearance changes—or, indeed, whenever the mood strikes them.": "最古老的绿焰族名字源自地精传统，但更近期的名字反映了这些人民自从走出黑暗后所遇到的不同文化的特征。当一群绿焰族生活在矮人附近时，他们可能会采用更像矮人的名字，但当他们漫游到人类地区时会改变这些名字。绿焰族也毫不犹豫地根据他们的外貌变化来改变他们的名字，或者在任何时候情绪一来时改变名字。",
	"Verdan make no differentiation between male, female, and family names, and often eschew family names altogether.": "Verdan（维丹）不区分男性、女性和姓氏，通常完全避免使用姓氏。",
	"Bronn, Crahma, Dolar, Dreeda, Duglee, Gruvald, Hulm, Jeal, Kalo, Klesh, Korm, Lathi, Ovlig, Paracii, Pils, Praet, Promul, Reezni, Rin, Shylk, Slyra, Sollo, Stalsii, Stromvo, Stussa, Syrkart, Takat, Toit, Tubyna, Varr, Veriga, Wraq, Wural, Wurxee": "布隆 (Bronn), 克拉哈玛 (Crahma), 多拉 (Dolar), 德瑞达 (Dreeda), 杜格利 (Duglee), 格鲁瓦尔德 (Gruvald), 赫尔姆 (Hulm), 杰尔 (Jeal), 卡洛 (Kalo), 克莱什 (Klesh), 科尔姆 (Korm), 拉希 (Lathi), 奥夫利格 (Ovlig), 帕拉西 (Paracii), 皮尔斯 (Pils), 普雷特 (Praet), 普罗穆尔 (Promul), 里兹尼 (Reezni), 林 (Rin), 西尔克 (Shylk), 斯莱拉 (Slyra), 索洛 (Sollo), 斯塔尔西 (Stalsii), 斯特罗姆沃 (Stromvo), 斯塔萨 (Stussa), 西卡特 (Syrkart), 塔卡特 (Takat), 托伊特 (Toit), 图比纳 (Tubyna), 瓦尔 (Varr), 维里加 (Veriga), 瓦拉克 (Wraq), 乌拉尔 (Wural), 乌尔克西 (Wurxee)",
	"When a verdan character gains an ability score improvement at certain levels, that increase can be tied to a physical mutation at the player's determination. A boost to Strength might be accompanied by a growth spurt and the development of rippling muscle, while an increase in Intelligence might produce a stylishly large forehead.": "当一个绿树人角色在特定等级获得属性分配提升时，这种增加可以与玩家决定的身体突变联系在一起。力量的提升可能伴随着身高的增长和肌肉的发展，而智力的增加可能会产生一个时尚的大额头。",

	"Vulpins are fox-like in appearance, with light builds and sharp fangs. One of the least understood and most often vilified humblefolk in the Wood, vulpins have earned a bad reputation that isn't entirely deserved. Much of this stems from the fact that vulpins are ambitious. Sometimes their drive to succeed can make it difficult for them to empathize with others. Vulpins feel just as deeply as other folk of the Wood, but they possess a keen survival instinct which sometimes causes them to take courses of action that are selfish. Moreover, they are sharp and savvy, possessing an uncanny force of personality that allows them to easily sway the trust of others. In the right situations, vulpins can be true friends, and in the wrong ones, deadly enemies.": "狐狸族（Vulpins）在外貌上类似狐狸，身材纤细，尖锐的尖牙。作为森林中最不被理解和最常被诋毁的平民族群之一，狐狸族赢得了一个并不完全应得的坏名声。这在很大程度上源自狐狸族的雄心壮志。有时候，他们成功的渴望会让他们难以同情他人。狐狸族和森林中的其他族群一样有着深厚的感情，但他们拥有敏锐的生存本能，有时会导致他们采取自私的行动。此外，他们聪明机敏，拥有一种不可思议的个性力量，使他们能够轻易地影响他人的信任。在适当的情况下，狐狸族可以成为真正的朋友，在错误的情况下，他们可能会成为致命的敌人。",
	"Vulpins are naturally intelligent, rivalled only by corvums. However, where corvums are studious, vulpins are more creative. They enjoy the arts and the pursuit of leisure. Some devote their lives to mastering an art form; learning sculpture, poetry, or refined swordplay. Even though vulpins come from every walk of life, they also have a reputation for being snobbish and looking down on others.": "狐灵(Vulpins)天生聪慧，仅次于乌鸦(Corvums)。然而，乌鸦擅长研究，而狐灵更富创造力。他们喜爱艺术和追求休闲。一些狐灵将毕生奉献于掌握一门艺术形式；学习雕塑、诗歌或精致的剑术。尽管狐灵来自各行各业，他们也以势利眼和看不起他人而闻名。",
	"All vulpins have a natural connection to the magic of the Wood, though they channel it in specialized ways. The right look from a vulpin can bewitch or terrify, and vulpins who are truly skilled can command an entire room through sheer force of presence.": "所有狐灵(vulpin)都与森林的魔法有着自然的联系，尽管他们以专门的方式引导它。一只狐灵(vulpin)的凝视可以使人着迷或恐惧，而那些真正有技巧的狐灵(vulpin)可以凭借强大的气场来指挥整个房间。",
	"Before the Humblefolk Treaty was signed, vulpins controlled a large part of the Wood outside the influence of the birdfolk, and bands of vulpin raiders provided their own kin with a wealth of plundered goods at the expense of birdfolk and other humblefolk alike. Those days are long since gone, but the memory of the sinister vulpin has yet to fade from the minds of the humblefolk, who endured great suffering at their hands.": "在(`Humblefolk Treaty`)签署之前，(`vulpins`)控制着(`Wood`)的大部分地区，超出了(`birdfolk`)的影响范围，(`vulpin raiders`)的团伙为他们自己的同类提供了大量被掠夺的物品，以牺牲(`birdfolk`)和其他(`humblefolk`)。那些日子早已过去，但(`vulpin`)邪恶的记忆仍未从(`humblefolk`)的心灵中消失，他们在(`vulpin`)手中遭受了巨大的苦难。",
	"A few vulpins have attempted to change public opinion, but the majority are unconcerned with their notoriety. Vulpins learn from a young age that they are of two natures: the sophisticated and the savage. While sophistication and elegance are generally preferred, it is considered common sense that vulpins should know when to keep their fangs hidden and when to bear them.": "一些狐狸人尝试改变公众舆论，但大多数人对他们的臭名无动于衷。狐狸人从小就学会了他们有两种本性：精致和野蛮。虽然一般更偏好精致和优雅，但普遍认为狐狸人应该知道何时隐藏他们的尖牙，何时展现出来。",
