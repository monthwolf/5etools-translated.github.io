	"A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.": "拥有盲目性的生物可以在特定的半径范围内，不依靠视觉来感知周围的环境。没有眼睛的生物，比如说乌鸦，以及具有回声定位或增强感官的生物，比如说蝙蝠和真龙，都有这种感觉。",
	"Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in that darkness, only shades of gray.": "奇幻游戏世界中的许多生物，特别是那些居住在地下的生物，都有暗视功能。在指定的范围内，拥有暗视能力的生物可以在昏暗的光线下看东西，就像亮光一样，在黑暗中看东西，就像暗光一样，所以就该生物而言，黑暗的区域只是被轻微遮蔽。然而，该生物在黑暗中无法辨别颜色，只有灰色的阴影。",
	"A creature with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the creature and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.": "拥有震感的生物可以探测并确定特定范围内振动的来源，前提是该生物和振动的来源接触到相同的地面或物质。震颤感应不能用于探测飞行或无体生物。许多钻地的生物，例如安克希斯和乌尔克，都有这种特殊的感觉。",
	"A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.": "拥有真实视力的生物可以在特定的范围内看到正常的和魔法的黑暗，看到看不见的生物和物体，自动检测到视觉幻觉并成功地对其进行拯救，并能感知变身者或被魔法转化的生物的原始形态。此外，该生物可以看到虚空界。"
