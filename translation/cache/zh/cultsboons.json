	"The earth cult worships the implacable strength and unyielding resistance of elemental earth. Cultists seek the power to destroy the works of civilization with landslides, sinkholes, or mighty earthquakes, thus demonstrating the true power of elemental earth and the futility of resistance. Earth cultists see mines, quarries, and tilled fields as insults imposed upon the living rock and soil. They believe the earth thirsts for the blood of those who don't venerate it before all other powers and beings.": "大地崇拜者崇拜大地元素的不可侵犯的力量和不屈不挠的抵抗。崇拜者寻求用山体滑坡、天坑或强大的地震来摧毁文明的作品，从而显示出地球元素的真正力量和抵抗的徒劳。大地崇拜者认为矿山、采石场和耕地是强加给活的岩石和土壤的侮辱。他们相信，地球渴望那些不在所有其他力量和生命面前崇敬它的人的血。",
	"The Cult of the Black Earth appeals to those who draw their fortunes from the earth-directly or indirectly. In areas where the influence of Elemental Evil takes hold, animals and monsters that live or burrow in the ground accept the cultists as allies.

	"The Black Earth cult is the most defense-minded and patient of the four elemental cults. Earth cultists admire stoicism, endurance, and unyielding resolve. They are deliberate and slow to act, careful to consider their plans and gather their strength before beginning any new enterprise. Once earth cultists resolve to act, they are inflexible, grinding their way forward through any obstacle or unforeseen development. They are single-minded in the extreme, and most earth cultists have little use for social niceties. They see common courtesy as a way for the weak to put limits on the behavior of the strong, and they scorn empathy or friendship as weakness.": "黑土邪教是四个元素邪教中最具防御意识和耐心的。大地崇拜者推崇坚忍不拔的精神、耐力和不屈的决心。他们深思熟虑，行动迟缓，在开始任何新的事业之前，都会仔细考虑他们的计划并聚集他们的力量。一旦地球崇拜者下定决心采取行动，他们就会不屈不挠，在任何障碍或不可预见的发展中磨练自己的前进道路。他们极端地一意孤行，而且大多数大地崇拜者对社会礼节没有什么用处。他们认为普通的礼貌是弱者对强者的行为施加限制的一种方式，他们蔑视同情或友谊，认为这是弱者。",
	"In battle, Black Earth cultists are brutal and straightforward. They overpower foes with direct assaults, although if they have the opportunity to undermine defenses or attack from below, they unhesitatingly put their skill at tunneling and mastery of burrowing monsters to good use. They are unflinching in the face of death. Surrender is never an option.": "在战斗中，黑土崇拜者是残酷而直接的。他们用直接攻击来制服敌人，尽管如果他们有机会破坏防御或从下面攻击，他们会毫不犹豫地把他们的隧道技术和对钻地怪物的掌握用在这里。他们在面对死亡时毫不退缩。投降从来不是一种选择。",
	"Earth cultists live and work underground. They craft weapons from stone or iron and \"bathe\" themselves in sand or dirt to feel close to their favored element.

	"Marlos began life as a human aristocrat, born into a wealthy Cormyrean family. He squandered his familys wealth on endless self-indulgence, seeking more questionable forms of entertainment through the years. The Urnrayle estate became known as a place of outrageous masquerades, bizarre banquets, and grotesque orgies. Marlos required his guests to don ugly or monstrous masks, thus ensuring that no ones beauty would outshine his own.": "马洛斯开始了人类贵族的生活，出生在一个富有的科米雷家族。他把家族的财富挥霍在无休止的自我放纵上，多年来寻求更多可疑的娱乐形式。厄恩雷尔庄园成为著名的离谱的化装舞会、怪异的宴会和怪诞的狂欢之地。马洛斯要求他的客人戴上丑陋或畸形的面具，从而确保没有人的美貌能胜过他自己。",
	"As he aged, Marlos turned to magic to preserve his fading beauty. After searching for years, he found a ring that contained the stolen vitality of a lovely fey creature. As long as he wore the ring, his imperfections vanished and no one could resist his physical charms-until the day the ring transformed Marlos into a medusa. The horror of his fate drove Marlos mad. He fled his ancestral home, taking his collection of masks with him.": "随着年龄的增长，马洛斯转而求助于魔法，以保持他逐渐消失的美丽。经过多年的寻找，他找到了一枚戒指，里面有一个可爱的精灵生物的偷来的活力。只要他戴上这枚戒指，他的缺陷就会消失，没有人能够抵挡他的身体魅力--直到有一天，这枚戒指把马洛斯变成了一只美杜莎。命运的恐怖使马洛斯发疯了。他带着他收集的面具逃离了他的祖屋。",
	"After years of wandering and hiding in one ruined estate or another across the Western Heartlands, Marlos felt drawn to the desolate Sumber Hills by troubling dreams and visions. A long stairway beneath a ruined monastery brought him to an ancient cavern with a hideous altar, upon which lay a war pick of iron. When the medusa claimed {@item Ironfang|PotA}, his purpose finally became clear to him. He established his lair in the dungeon nearby and began building the Cult of the Black Earth.": "在西部心脏地带的一个或另一个破败的庄园里流浪和躲藏多年后，马洛斯感到被令人不安的梦和幻觉吸引到了荒凉的桑伯山。一座破败的修道院下的长梯将他带到一个古老的洞穴，里面有一个可怕的祭坛，上面躺着一把铁制的战镐。当美杜莎声称{@item Ironfang|PotA}时，他的目的终于变得清晰起来。他在附近的地牢里建立了自己的巢穴，并开始建立黑土教。",
	"Unlike many of his followers, Marlos is genteel and well-spoken. He delights in witty banter and pointed repartee, although he is quick to make a cutting remark or jest at someone elses expense. Marlos takes pleasure in mocking others, especially if he can do so in a clever or elegant way. Marloss previous life had been a constant search for pleasure, but the only thing that now stirs his loveless soul is refined cruelty. He can be driven to fits of blind, unreasoning jealousy if he is outshone by another urbane and attractive individual.": "与他的许多追随者不同，马洛斯风度翩翩，谈吐得体。他喜欢诙谐的戏谑和尖锐的对答，尽管他很快就会说些尖锐的话语或以别人的名义开玩笑。马洛斯以嘲弄他人为乐，特别是如果他能以一种聪明或优雅的方式这样做。马洛斯以前的生活一直在寻找快乐，但现在唯一能激起他无爱的灵魂的是精致的残忍。如果他被另一个彬彬有礼的有魅力的人比下去了，他就会被驱赶到盲目的、无理的嫉妒中。",
	"The Black Earth cultists are highly suspicious of the Cult of Howling Hatred. They believe that the air cultists are mercurial, unreliable, and generally out of touch with reality. The earth cultists respect the strength and ferocity of the Eternal Flame followers, but also find them maddeningly inconstant. Black Earth cultists ally most often with the Crushing Wave, since they admire the patience and pragmatism of the water cultists.": "黑土邪教的人对嚎叫的仇恨邪教高度怀疑。他们认为空气邪教的人是水银泻地，不可靠的，而且通常与现实脱节。大地崇拜者尊重永恒之火追随者的力量和凶猛，但也发现他们令人抓狂的不稳定。黑土教派最常与碎浪教派结盟，因为他们欣赏水教派的耐心和实用主义。",
	"Cultists of the Crushing Wave worship the awesome power of water, from the surging tides and deadly maelstroms of the sea to the raging torrents of rivers in flood and the rock-crushing power of ice and glaciers. Crushing Wave cultists see all living creatures as nothing more than trapped water that could one day be free to return to the seas or skies in a new form. The seas and deep waters are eager to reclaim the parts of themselves currently held in the blood and bodies of living creatures, and it is the duty of Crushing Wave initiates to return nonbelievers to the primal waters by drowning them or shedding their blood.": "碎浪崇拜者崇拜水的可怕力量，从海中汹涌的潮汐和致命的漩涡到洪水中汹涌的河水，以及冰和冰川的岩石粉碎力。碎浪崇拜者认为所有的生物都不过是被困的水，有一天可以自由地以新的形式回到海洋或天空。海洋和深海渴望收回自己目前在生物的血液和身体中的部分，而破碎浪潮发起人的职责就是通过淹死他们或流干他们的血，将不信者送回原始水域。",
	"The Crushing Wave cult appeals to those who live in or near bodies of water, as well as to those who appreciate subtlety and inevitability. Wicked sea creatures such as aquatic ghouls and merrows are friendly toward water cultists. Even non-sentient predators such as sharks or octopuses understand that water cultists are allies to be aided or masters to be obeyed.": "碎浪教吸引了那些生活在水体中或附近的人，以及那些欣赏微妙和不可避免性的人。邪恶的海洋生物，如水生食尸鬼和美人鱼，对水崇拜者很友好。即使是鲨鱼或章鱼等无知觉的掠食者也明白，水崇拜者是需要帮助的盟友或需要服从的主人。",
	"Water cultists use a simple hand sign to identify one another when a token of recognition is required: crossing the forefingers and overlapping the thumbs to create an X-shape linked by a line across the bottom. It stands for waters eternal surge and retreat, a cycle of unending change.": "水崇拜者使用一个简单的手势来识别彼此的身份，当需要确认的时候：食指交叉，拇指重叠，形成一个X形，底部有一条线连接。它代表着水域永恒的涌动和退缩，一个无休止变化的循环。",
	"Crushing Wave cultists are almost as patient and stoic as the followers of the earth cult. They understand the value of outlasting formidable foes and slowly eroding their defenses. However, they are far more flexible and opportunistic in their overall philosophy than the earth cultists are. Like a flood that seeks the weak point in a levee and then bursts through with ever-growing strength, water cultists are quick to sense an opening and then act to exploit it. This philosophy of pragmatism and opportunism means that the Crushing Wave is the most mercenary of the four elemental cults. Water cultists eagerly seek out rich prizes and use their ill-gotten loot to develop their schemes.": "碎浪邪教的信徒几乎和大地邪教的信徒一样有耐心和坚忍。他们明白战胜强大的敌人并慢慢侵蚀其防御的价值。然而，他们在整体理念上要比大地崇拜者灵活得多、机会主义得多。就像洪水寻找堤坝的薄弱点，然后以不断增长的力量冲破堤坝一样，水崇拜者很快就能感觉到一个缺口，然后采取行动来利用它。这种实用主义和机会主义的哲学意味着破碎浪潮是四个元素邪教中最雇佣的。水崇拜者热衷于寻找丰富的奖品，并利用他们不义之财来发展他们的计划。",
	"In combat, Crushing Wave cultists excel as skirmishers. They value mobility and opportunism, rarely making a stand in one place for long. Instead, they feign retreats, regroup, and launch new attacks, wearing down their foes like storm-driven waves eating away at a sandy beach. Almost all water cultists are excellent swimmers skilled at fighting in water, so they look for opportunities to surprise their enemies by using bodies of water to slip around or through defenses.": "在战斗中，破碎浪潮的邪教徒擅长做小兵。他们重视机动性和机会主义，很少在一个地方长期驻扎。相反，他们会假装撤退，重新集结，然后发动新的攻击，就像风暴驱动的海浪侵蚀沙滩一样消磨他们的敌人。几乎所有的水崇拜者都是优秀的游泳者，擅长在水中作战，所以他们寻找机会，利用水体绕过或穿过防线，给敌人一个惊喜。",
	"Because the cultists see water as the wellspring of all life and purpose, they spend as much time in or around it as possible. Many cult hideouts are located near large bodies of water, and those that aren't feature hidden pools or wells in which cult members can immerse themselves. Water cultists prize water-breathing magic and seek it out for no other reason than to spend hours meditating underwater. Few cultists gain any profound insights from these exercises.": "由于邪教成员将水视为所有生命和目的的源泉，他们尽可能多地在水里或周围度过。许多邪教的藏身之处都位于大型水体附近，而那些没有的地方则有隐藏的水池或水井，邪教成员可以将自己浸泡在其中。水上邪教的信徒非常重视水呼吸的魔法，他们寻找水呼吸的原因无非是为了在水下花几个小时进行冥想。很少有邪教成员从这些练习中获得任何深刻的见解。",
	"Gar was born in a poor fishing village in the Nelanther Isles. At a young age, he lost his family to a sahuagin attack. The sea devils slaughtered almost everyone he knew. A Tethyrian merchant galley conscripted the young orphan into service, and Gar was forced into a brutal indentured servitude that was barely better than being enslaved. His unwilling service came to an end when pirates attacked the merchant ship. During the fighting, Gar was knocked overboard. For days he survived by clinging to the ships wreckage, until a shark ripped off his left arm. Death seemed imminent, but a powerful current arose and bore him away from the hungry predator. Within an hour he was cast upon the shores of the Sword Coast.": "加尔出生在内兰瑟群岛的一个贫穷的渔村。在他很小的时候，他的家人就在萨瓦金人的袭击中丧生。海妖们几乎屠杀了他认识的所有人。一艘泰特里亚商船征召这个年轻的孤儿服役，加尔被迫接受残酷的契约奴役，勉强比被奴役好一点。当海盗袭击商船时，他不情愿的服务就结束了。在战斗中，加尔被打翻在地。几天来，他紧紧抓着船的残骸，直到一条鲨鱼撕下他的左臂。死亡似乎迫在眉睫，但一股强大的水流将他从饥饿的掠食者身边冲走。在一个小时内，他被扔到了剑海岸的海岸上。",
	"Gar believed that the current that had saved his life was an elemental sent by the sea. From that day forward, he devoted himself to the ocean, teaching himself its secrets and learning powerful water magic over years of lonely wandering. He despised all other people, remembering only his harsh treatment by the merchant crew and the brutality of the pirates. But in time he became aware of a call to a higher purpose, impelling him to find other examples of human flotsam and teach them about the power of the sea.": "加尔相信，救他一命的水流是大海派来的元素。从那天起，他就把自己献给了海洋，在多年的孤独漂泊中自学了海洋的秘密和强大的水魔法。他鄙视所有其他人，只记得他受到商船船员的严厉对待和海盗的残暴。但随着时间的推移，他意识到一种对更高目标的呼唤，促使他去寻找其他人类的浮尸，并向他们传授海洋的力量。",
	"Gars visions led him to the secret waters beneath the Sumber Hills. He found a hidden cavern temple, on whose altar lay a powerful magical trident. Sensing its power, Gar took up the weapon and began to call his cult to join him in the Temple of the Crushing Wave.": "加尔斯的幻觉将他引向桑伯山下的秘密水域。他发现了一个隐藏的洞穴寺庙，其祭坛上躺着一把强大的魔法三叉戟。感受到它的力量，加尔拿起武器，开始召唤他的崇拜者加入他的碎浪寺。",
	"Gar is covered in barnacles, and he wears an artificial arm in the shape of a crabs claw over the stump of his left arm. He never uses two words when one will do, and he believes that anyone addressing him with courtesy is either insincere or subtly mocking him. The water prophets primary motivation is retribution; the world has been cruel to him, and he intends to make everyone else suffer as he has. He longs to be near the ocean again and is distressed by the fact that the driving force behind his visions keeps him so far from the sea.": "加尔浑身都是藤壶，他的左臂残肢上戴着一只蟹爪形状的假臂。他从来不用两个字，如果一个字就够了，而且他认为任何人以礼相待都是不真诚的，或者是在巧妙地嘲笑他。水先知的主要动机是报应；世界对他很残酷，他打算让其他人也像他一样受苦。他渴望再次接近海洋，并为他的幻觉背后的驱动力使他远离大海而感到痛苦。",
	"The followers of the Crushing Wave detest the Cult of the Eternal Flame. They find the fire cultists to be hostile, short-tempered, and unforgivably rash. The Howling Hatred cultists aren't as hostile, but they are likewise given to sudden impulses and are unreliable. The water cultists get along with the Cult of the Black Earth. The earth cultists are deliberate and dependable, if perhaps too inflexible for their own good.": "碎浪的追随者厌恶永恒火焰的崇拜。他们发现火崇拜者充满敌意，脾气暴躁，而且不可原谅地轻率。嚎叫的仇恨教派没有那么多敌意，但他们也同样会有突然的冲动，而且不可靠。水崇拜者与黑土崇拜者相处融洽。大地崇拜者是深思熟虑和可靠的，尽管可能对他们自己来说太不灵活了。",
	"The followers of the Eternal Flame cult worship the destructive power of fire in all its manifestations. They seek the power to burn away the \"corruption\" of both civilization and nature with volcanic eruptions, forest fires, heat waves, and droughts, creating a wasteland of ash and cinders ruled by fire alone. Eternal Flame cultists believe the world and all its peoples are wicked and malformed, and they consider it a sacred duty to \"purify\" everything around them by reducing their surroundings to smoking cinders.": "永恒之火崇拜的追随者崇拜火的所有表现形式的破坏力。他们寻求用火山爆发、森林大火、热浪和干旱烧掉文明和自然界的 \"腐败 \"的力量，创造一个只由火统治的灰烬和煤渣的荒地。永恒之火的崇拜者认为世界和所有的人都是邪恶和畸形的，他们认为通过把周围的环境变成冒烟的焦炭来 \"净化 \"他们周围的一切是一种神圣的责任。",
	"The Eternal Flame appeals to those drawn to destruction for its own sake. Creatures of elemental fire are most likely to take up this reckless philosophy; even non-intelligent fire monsters sense the reckless lust for destruction lurking in the hearts of fire cultists and consider Eternal Flame believers to be their allies.": "永恒之火吸引着那些为了毁灭而被吸引的人。火元素的生物最有可能接受这种鲁莽的哲学；甚至非智能的火怪也能感觉到潜伏在火崇拜者心中的鲁莽的毁灭欲望，并认为永恒之焰的信徒是他们的盟友。",
	"The symbol of the fire cult is reminiscent of a bowl-like brazier with a burning flame. Fire cultists sometimes identify themselves with a symbolic hand sign: holding one hand in a fist, thumb up, and laying the other hand over the fist as if to cover the bowl but allow the flame to show. Members of the cult can also be identified by their burn scars.": "火崇拜的标志让人联想到一个碗状的钎子，上面有燃烧的火焰。火崇拜者有时会用一个象征性的手势来表明自己的身份：一只手握拳，拇指向上，另一只手放在拳头上，好像要盖住碗，但允许火焰露出来。该邪教的成员也可以通过他们的烧伤疤痕来识别。",
	"Fire cultists are impetuous, hot-tempered, and violent. They aren't mindless savages; their impetuousness also encompasses fiendish inventiveness and a drive to devise new tools for their mad cause. They are masters of fire and forge, taking captives to work in their infernal foundries. Fire cultists see conquest and enslavement of the weak as necessary steps in bringing about the chaos they intend to unleash on the world.": "火崇拜者是急躁的、脾气暴躁的和暴力的。他们不是无意识的野蛮人；他们的急躁也包含了恶魔般的创造力和为他们的疯狂事业设计新工具的动力。他们是火和锻造的大师，会把俘虏带到他们的地狱铸造厂里工作。火崇拜者认为征服和奴役弱者是实现他们打算在世界范围内释放的混乱的必要步骤。",
	"In battle, fire cultists launch sudden, overwhelming assaults. They throw themselves into reckless attacks with no regard for their own lives, seeking to cause as much damage as possible before falling. They are fearless and would rather die fighting among a mob of enemies than retreat a single step.": "在战斗中，火崇拜者发起突然的、压倒性的攻击。他们不顾自己的生命，不顾一切地投入攻击，力求在倒下之前造成尽可能多的伤害。他们无所畏惧，宁可死在一群敌人中战斗，也不愿意退缩一步。",
	"Followers of the Eternal Flame cult surround themselves with the largest fires they can create. Their favorite tactic involves using magic to open volcanic fissures or vents and channel flows of molten rock. Widespread arson and deliberately set forest fires are acceptable alternatives. Most fire cultists believe that something important and beautiful should be set on fire every day, or else they're just not doing their part.": "永恒之火邪教的追随者用他们能创造的最大的火包围自己。他们最喜欢的策略是用魔法打开火山裂缝或通风口，引导熔岩流动。广泛的纵火和故意设置的森林大火是可以接受的替代方法。大多数火崇拜者认为，一些重要而美丽的东西应该每天都被点燃，否则他们就是没有尽到自己的责任。",
	"Through all-consuming ambition and a desire to punish all who ever thwarted her dreams, the tiefling Vanifer has risen to leadership of the Eternal Flame cult. Beneath her refined exterior is a steel edge of scorned pride. And underneath her hard pride lies a desire for murder and mayhem. Vanifer harbors a fierce hatred for all who think themselves superior to her, and she stops at nothing to make them see her as a figure to be feared and respected.": "通过全身心的野心和惩罚所有曾经阻挠她梦想的人的愿望，铁皮人Vanifer已经上升为永恒之火教派的领导。在她精致的外表下，有一个被蔑视的骄傲的钢铁边缘。而在她坚硬的骄傲之下，是对谋杀和混乱的渴望。瓦尼法对所有认为自己比她优越的人怀有强烈的仇恨，她不惜一切代价让他们将她视为一个值得敬畏和尊重的人物。",
	"Vanifer was born and raised in the crushing poverty of Calimports poorest quarters, armed with only her cunning intelligence. In her youth, she learned to dance for coin and slowly worked her way up from the wine sinks of the laborers districts to the elegant chambers of the citys nobles. She mastered minor fire magic to distinguish herself from other dancers and incorporated flame into her routine. Her talents grew, and soon she caught the eye of a pasha and became his concubine. But even as she enjoyed the gifts he lavished on her, Vanifer hated the pasha for seeing her as a mere trophy. She left before long, robbing the pasha of a small fortune in jewelry and setting fire to his palace.": "瓦尼法在卡里姆波特最贫穷的地区出生和长大，只靠她狡猾的智慧。在她年轻的时候，她学会了为钱而跳舞，并慢慢地从工人区的酒池子里爬到了城市贵族的优雅房间里。她掌握了小的火魔法，以区别于其他舞者，并将火焰融入她的舞步。她的才能不断增长，很快她就引起了一位帕夏的注意，并成为他的妾。但是，即使她享受着他给她的礼物，瓦尼法也恨这个帕夏把她看作是一个单纯的战利品。她不久就离开了，抢走了帕夏的一小笔珠宝财富，并放火烧了他的宫殿。",
	"Vanifer is an extraordinary manipulator. She collects allies and followers with her wiles, using them as she needs and discarding them the moment they lose their usefulness. Its a testament to her natural talent that many of her victims are pathetically eager to bask in the glow of her attention again if she discovers she needs something else from them. While Vanifer puts on the airs of a rich noble, she despises those raised with great wealth, and her sensibilities favor the coarse. Vanifer is ambitious above all else, and as undisputed master of the fire cult, she intends to make the Eternal Flame the strongest and most feared cult of all.": "瓦尼法是一个非凡的操纵者。她用她的诡计收集盟友和追随者，在她需要的时候使用他们，在他们失去用处的时候抛弃他们。这证明了她的天赋，如果她发现自己需要其他东西，她的许多受害者都会可怜兮兮地渴望再次沐浴在她的目光中。虽然Vanifer摆出了富有贵族的架势，但她鄙视那些用巨大财富养大的人，而且她的感觉更倾向于粗俗。瓦尼法的野心高于一切，作为火教无可争议的主人，她打算让永恒之火成为最强大和最令人畏惧的教派。",
	"Eternal Flame cultists detest the followers of the Crushing Wave. They see the water cultists as slippery and untrustworthy, perhaps even cowardly-after all, the Crushing Wave retreats quickly from opposition and seeks the path of least resistance before committing its strength. The earth cultists are stolid and courageous, but maddeningly slow to act. The cultists of the Howling Hatred share the fire cults impulse to act swiftly and show many of the same qualities of inventiveness and creativity in the service of Elemental Evil.": "永恒之火的崇拜者厌恶破碎之浪的追随者。在他们看来，水崇拜者滑头，不值得信任，甚至可能是懦弱的--毕竟，破碎浪潮在遇到反对时迅速撤退，在投入力量之前寻求阻力最小的路径。大地邪教的人固执而勇敢，但行动却慢得令人抓狂。嚎叫之恨的邪教徒与火邪教徒一样有迅速行动的冲动，并在为元素之恶服务时表现出许多相同的发明和创造的品质。",
	"The followers of elemental air call themselves the Cult of the Howling Hatred. They worship the destructive power of wind and storms, believing that those who venerate elemental air gain the power to punish those who have wronged them. More so than the members of the other cults, air cultists see their beliefs as a means to an end. Destruction for its own sake isn't particularly interesting, but destruction as an expression of personal freedom or to earn things wrongfully denied? Thats a different story.": "空气元素的追随者称自己为 \"憎恨嚎叫 \"教。他们崇拜风和风暴的破坏力，相信那些崇尚空气元素的人能够获得惩罚那些对他们不利的人的力量。与其他邪教成员相比，空气崇拜者更将他们的信仰视为达到目的的手段。破坏本身并不特别有趣，但破坏是个人自由的一种表达方式，或者是为了赢得被错误剥夺的东西？这是一个不同的故事。",
	"The Cult of the Howling Hatred appeals to those who deal in perceptions over facts: illusionists, spies, and assassins, for example. Predatory or fierce winged creatures of any kind, even non-sentient monsters that would otherwise resist training, perceive the air cultists as allies and cooperate with them. Hippogriffs, griffons, and giant vultures are frequently used as air cult steeds.": "仇恨嚎叫教吸引了那些以感知而非事实为交易对象的人：比如说幻术师、间谍和刺客。任何种类的掠夺性或凶猛的有翼生物，甚至是那些原本会抵制训练的无知觉的怪物，都会把空气崇拜者视为盟友并与他们合作。河马、狮鹫和巨型秃鹰经常被用作空中邪教的坐骑。",
	"The symbol of elemental air is an inverted triangle with three branching lines above it. Some believe it stands for the funnel cloud of a tornado, while others see it as the superiority of winged creatures over the ground. Some maintain it is an ancient rune that stands for the elemental lord Yan-C-Bin. Whatever their interpretations, the air cultists use the symbol as a secret password of sorts. By touching the thumbs and little fingers together and closing the rest of the fingers into a fist, an air cultist forms an inverted triangle that is a mark of membership in the cult.": "空气元素的象征是一个倒三角形，上面有三条分支线。有些人认为它代表龙卷风的漏斗云，而其他人则认为它是有翼生物对地面的优越性。有些人认为这是一个古老的符文，代表着元素领主Yan-C-Bin。无论他们的解释是什么，空气崇拜者都把这个符号作为一种秘密的密码。通过将大拇指和小拇指碰在一起，并将其余的手指握成拳头，一个空气崇拜者就形成了一个倒三角形，这也是该邪教成员的标志。",
	"Howling Hatred cultists are clever, impulsive, and creative. They usually see themselves as smarter, quicker, and more capable than others they meet. Howling Hatred cultists dislike open battle. They prefer to work in secret, using stealth and illusion to gain their ends with a minimum of force. Tactics of deception and ambush provide the air cultists with opportunities to prove themselves smarter and more resourceful than their opponents. The wind doesn't blow down a castle, but flows around and through it. Infiltration and indirect attack are clearly superior tactics.": "嚎叫的仇恨邪教分子聪明、冲动、有创造力。他们通常认为自己比他们遇到的其他人更聪明、更快、更有能力。嚎叫的仇恨邪教者不喜欢公开的战斗。他们更喜欢秘密行动，使用隐身术和幻觉，以最小的力量达到他们的目的。欺骗和伏击的战术为空中邪教者提供了证明自己比对手更聪明、更有办法的机会。风不会吹倒一座城堡，而是绕着它、穿过它流动。渗透和间接攻击显然是优势战术。",
	"Air cultists seek out high places for their strongholds wherever possible, although they value subterranean spaces with wide chasms or lofty vaults. Places where flying is possible are mandatory. The followers of the Howling Hatred understand that sometimes they must put secrecy above other considerations.": "空中崇拜者尽可能地寻找高处作为他们的据点，尽管他们更看重有宽阔裂缝或高耸拱顶的地下空间。可以飞行的地方是必须的。嚎叫之恨的追随者明白，有时他们必须把保密性放在其他考虑因素之上。",
	"The moon elf Aerisi Kalinoth leads the Cult of the Howling Hatred. Tall and slender, with illusory wings that gently fan the air, Aerisi speaks to her people in a whisper that sounds clearly in the ears of all in her presence. Aerisi regards her followers not as cultists, but as her noble subjects. Before them she is prophet and queen. Musicians and courtiers amuse and flatter her, and warriors mounted on hippogriffs serve as her knights.": "月亮精灵艾瑞丝-卡里诺斯领导着嚎叫的仇恨崇拜。艾瑞丝身材高大修长，拥有轻轻扇动空气的虚幻翅膀，她用低语对她的子民说话，在她面前的所有人都听得很清楚。艾瑞西不把她的追随者视为邪教徒，而是视为她高贵的臣民。在他们面前，她是先知和女王。音乐家和朝臣逗她开心，奉承她，而骑在河马上的战士则是她的骑士。",
	"Aerisi grew up in an enchanted castle in a remote part of Faerun, surrounded by tales, histories, and tomes of magic. She passed her early years playing games, practicing enchantments, and imagining herself as one of the avariel (winged elves) from her storybooks. Her parents' sheltered her from the conflicts of Faerun, and she came of age with a tender and fragile disposition.": "爱丽斯在法隆偏远地区的一座魔法城堡里长大，周围充满了故事、历史和魔法书。她在早年玩游戏，练习魔法，并把自己想象成故事书中的avariel（有翅膀的精灵）之一。她的父母为她提供庇护，使她免受法隆冲突的影响，她长大后性格温柔而脆弱。",
	"Eventually her paren'ts decided it was time for their daughter to engage in elven society, and they brought her to the hidden city of Evereska. Her paren'ts then realized their grave mistake. In pampering and sheltering their daughter, they had raised not a young lady but a spoiled child. Accustomed to having all she desired, the princess erupted into tantrums whenever she was denied her slightest whim, and the moon elves of Evereska could hardly endure her.": "最后，她的父母决定是时候让他们的女儿参与精灵社会了，于是他们把她带到了隐蔽的城市Evereska。她的父母随后意识到他们的严重错误。在对女儿的呵护和庇护中，他们培养的不是一个年轻的女士，而是一个被宠坏的孩子。公主习惯于拥有她想要的一切，每当她最微小的愿望被拒绝时，她就会爆发脾气，Evereska的月精灵们几乎无法忍受她。",
	"Aerisi felt powerless among the moon elves. Although she had become a skilled enchanter in Faerie, her people were resistant to such charms. In her dreams she began to envision herself as one of the winged elves from her storybooks. She wished to control the wind and go wherever she liked, and to punish those who offended her. The childlike fantasies of her youth became dark visions where she ruled the storms and the air itself. She dreamed of an old mystic with brown skin and white hair, who promised to teach her all she desired to know-a vision of Yan-C-Bin, the Prince of Evil Air. Aerisi turned her study to elemental air, learning the secret of flight and escaping Evereska to follow the deluded visions of her dreams.": "爱丽斯在月精灵中感到无能为力。虽然她在精灵界已经成为一个熟练的魔法师，但她的人民对这种魅力有抵触。在她的梦中，她开始把自己想象成故事书中的有翼精灵之一。她希望能控制风，去她喜欢的地方，并惩罚那些冒犯她的人。她年轻时的童真幻想变成了黑暗的幻觉，在那里她统治着风暴和空气本身。她梦见一个棕色皮肤和白色头发的老神秘主义者，他答应教她所有她想知道的东西--这是邪恶空气王子Yan-C-Bin的愿景。爱丽斯将她的研究转向了空气元素，学会了飞行的秘密，并逃离了埃弗里斯卡，追随她梦中的妄想。",
	"No one can deny Aerisis grace, but she also possesses a violent temper that reveals itself whenever she is denied what she wants. Aerisi is prone to flights of fancy and impulsive decadence. She doesn't see herself as evil because she lacks the capacity to empathize with anyone else. Those who worship and please her are good, and those who defy her are wicked and must be punished. Her wish to lash the world with storms and destruction is, at its root, a temper tantrum against the elven society that dared to impose its strictures on her.": "没有人可以否认艾里西的优雅，但她也拥有暴躁的脾气，每当她被拒绝她想要的东西时就会暴露出来。爱丽斯容易幻想成空，冲动颓废。她不认为自己是邪恶的，因为她缺乏对其他人的同情能力。那些崇拜和取悦她的人是好的，而那些违抗她的人是邪恶的，必须受到惩罚。她希望用风暴和毁灭来冲击世界，从根本上说，是对敢于对她强加约束的精灵社会的一种发脾气行为。",
	"The cultists of the Howling Hatred find the Black Earth cultists to be coarse, rude, unimaginative, and stubborn to the point of stupidity. Most offensively, the earth cultists are bluntly unimpressed by the Howling Hatred cult and its achievements. Followers of the Crushing Wave are more flexible and inventive, but they are crass mercenaries and likewise too pragmatic to appreciate the finer points of the air cults philosophy. The Eternal Flame is the best of the lot, since the fire cultists share the decisiveness and creative energy of the Howling Hatred cult, even if they are overly proud and aggressive.": "嚎叫之恨的邪教徒认为黑土邪教徒粗糙、粗鲁、缺乏想象力，而且顽固到愚蠢的地步。最令人反感的是，大地崇拜者对嚎叫之恨邪教及其成就直言不讳地不以为然。碎浪的追随者更灵活、更有创造力，但他们是粗俗的雇佣兵，同样也太务实，无法欣赏空气邪教哲学的精髓。永恒之火是其中的佼佼者，因为火崇拜者分享了嚎叫之恨邪教的果断和创造性能量，尽管他们过于骄傲和好斗。",
