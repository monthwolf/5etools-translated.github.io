{
	"With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will.": "肩膀上蜷缩着一条假龙，一个身穿金色长袍的年轻精灵热情地微笑着，在他的蜜语中编织着一种神奇的魅力，使宫殿里的哨兵屈服于他的意志。",
	"As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic.": "当火焰在她手中涌现时，一个老练的人类低声说出了她的恶魔守护者的秘密名字，为她的咒语注入了恶魔般的魔力。",
	"Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.": "他的目光在一本破旧的书本和头顶上奇怪的星星排列之间转移，一个野眼的盗贼吟唱着神秘的仪式，这将打开通往一个遥远世界的大门。",
	"Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.": "术士是对隐藏在多元宇宙结构中的知识的追求者。通过与具有超自然力量的神秘生物签订契约，术士们释放出既微妙又壮观的魔法效果。术士们利用诸如费伊贵族、恶魔、魔鬼、女巫和远界的外星实体的古老知识，拼凑出神秘的秘密来增强自己的力量。",
	"A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron's behalf.": "一个术士的定义是与一个异世界的存在签订契约。有时，术士和守护者之间的关系就像牧师和神灵之间的关系，尽管作为术士的守护者的生命并不是神。一个术士可能会领导一个致力于恶魔王子、大恶魔或完全陌生的实体的崇拜者--这些人通常不为牧师服务。但更多时候，这种安排类似于师傅和学徒之间的关系。术士学习并增长力量，代价是偶尔为赞助人提供服务。",
	"The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.": "赋予术士的魔法范围很广，从对术士的微小但持久的改变（比如在黑暗中看东西或阅读任何语言的能力）到获得强大的法术。与书本上的巫师不同，术士们用一些徒手搏斗的技巧来补充他们的魔法。他们穿着轻质的盔甲，知道如何使用简单的武器。",
	"Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.": "术士们被一种对知识和力量的永不满足的需求所驱使，这迫使他们加入他们的契约，并塑造他们的生活。这种渴求促使术士们进入他们的契约，也塑造了他们后来的职业生涯。",
	"Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student's mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.": "术士将自己与恶魔结合的故事广为人知。但许多术士服务的主顾并不是恶魔。有时，一个在荒野中的旅行者来到一座奇特美丽的塔楼前，见到了塔楼的女主人或女郎，并在没有完全意识到的情况下偶然加入了一个契约。有时，在翻阅禁忌传说的书本时，一个聪明但疯狂的学生的头脑被打开，了解到物质世界以外的现实，以及居住在外部虚空中的外星生物。",
	"Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge and power can't be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.": "一旦达成契约，术士对知识和力量的渴求就不能仅靠学习和研究来满足。如果不打算使用由此获得的力量，没有人会与这样一个强大的守护者签订契约。相反，绝大多数的术士都在积极追求他们的目标，这通常意味着某种冒险。此外，他们的赞助人的要求促使术士们走向冒险。",
	"As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you?": "在你塑造你的术士角色时，花些时间思考你的守护者和你的契约对你施加的义务。是什么促使你订立契约，你是如何与你的守护者取得联系的？你是被引诱去召唤一个魔鬼，还是去寻找能让你与一个外星长老神接触的仪式？是你在寻找你的守护神，还是你的守护神找到并选择了你？你是在契约的义务下感到苦恼，还是在期待着承诺给你的回报时快乐地服务？",
	"What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your patron's plans? Do you know other servants of your patron?": "你和你的赞助人有什么样的关系？是友好的、对立的、不安的，还是浪漫的？你的赞助人认为你有多重要？你在你的赞助人的计划中扮演什么角色？你认识你的赞助人的其他仆人吗？",
	"How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron's voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds—messages that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries.": "你的赞助人如何与你交流？如果你有一个熟悉的人，它可能偶尔会用你守护者的声音说话。有些术士发现他们的守护者的信息刻在树上，混在茶叶中，或漂浮在云端--这些信息只有术士能看到。其他术士在梦中或清醒的幻觉中与他们的守护者交谈，或者只与中间人打交道。",
	"You think me mad? I think true insanity is being content to live a life of mortal drudgery when knowledge and power is there for the taking in the realm beyond.": "你认为我疯了吗？我认为真正的疯狂是满足于过着凡人的苦工生活，而知识和力量就在那里，可以得到超越的领域。",
	"Warlocks are finders and keepers of secrets. They push at the edge of our understanding of the world, always seeking to expand their expertise. Where sages or wizards might heed a clear sign of danger and end their research, a warlock plunges ahead, heedless of the cost. Thus, it takes a peculiar mixture of intelligence, curiosity, and recklessness to produce a warlock. Many folk would describe that combination as evidence of madness. Warlocks see it as a demonstration of bravery.": "术士是秘密的发现者和守护者。他们在我们对世界的理解的边缘推进，一直在寻求扩大他们的专业知识。圣人或巫师可能会注意到危险的明显迹象并结束他们的研究，而术士则勇往直前，不计代价。因此，产生一个术士需要一种奇特的智慧、好奇心和鲁莽的混合物。许多人将这种组合描述为疯狂的证据。术士们则认为这是勇敢的表现。",
	"Warlocks are defined by two elements that work in concert to forge their path into this class. The first element is the event or circumstances that led to a warlock's entering into a pact with a planar entity. The second one is the nature of the entity a warlock is bound to. Unlike clerics, who typically embrace a deity and that god's ethos, a warlock might have no love for a patron, or vice versa.": "术士是由两个元素定义的，这两个元素共同作用于他们进入这个等级的道路。第一个要素是导致术士与一个平面实体达成契约的事件或情况。第二个要素是术士所绑定的实体的性质。与牧师不同的是，他们通常拥护一个神灵和该神灵的精神，而术士可能对一个守护者没有爱，反之亦然。",
	"The sections that follow provide ways to embellish a warlock character that could generate some intriguing story and roleplaying opportunities.": "接下来的章节提供了美化术士角色的方法，可以产生一些引人入胜的故事和角色扮演的机会。",
	"Every relationship is a two-way street, but in the case of warlocks and their patrons it's not necessarily true that both sides of the street are the same width or made of the same stuff. The feeling that a warlock holds for their patron, whether positive or negative, might be reciprocated by the patron, or the two participants in the pact might view one another with opposing emotions.": "每一种关系都是双向的，但就术士和他们的赞助人而言，街道的两边不一定是相同的宽度或由相同的东西组成。术士对其赞助人的感情，无论是积极的还是消极的，都可能得到赞助人的回应，或者契约中的两个参与者可能以相反的情绪看待彼此。",
	"When you determine the attitude your warlock character holds toward your patron, also consider how things look from the patron's perspective. How does your patron behave toward you? Is your patron a friend and ally, or an enemy that grants you power only because you forced a pact upon it?": "当你决定你的术士角色对你的赞助人所持的态度时，也要考虑从赞助人的角度看问题。你的守护者对你的行为如何？你的守护者是一个朋友和盟友，还是一个只因为你强迫它签订契约而给予你力量的敌人？",
	"Your patron has guided and helped your family for generations and is kindly toward you.": "你的赞助人世代指导和帮助你的家庭，对你很友善。",
	"Each interaction with your capricious patron is a surprise, whether pleasant or painful.": "与你任性的赞助人的每一次互动都是一个惊喜，无论是愉快的还是痛苦的。",
	"Your patron is the spirit of a long-dead hero who sees your pact as a way for it to continue to influence the world.": "你的赞助人是一位早已去世的英雄的灵魂，他把你的契约看作是它继续影响世界的一种方式。",
	"Your patron is a strict disciplinarian but treats you with a measure of respect.": "你的赞助人是一个严格的纪律者，但对你有一定的尊重。",
	"Your patron tricked you into a pact and treats you as a slave.": "你的赞助人把你骗进了一个契约，把你当成了奴隶。",
	"You are mostly left to your own devices with no interference from your patron. Sometimes you dread the demands it will make when it does appear.": "你大部分时间都是自己的事情，没有赞助人的干扰。有时你会害怕它出现时提出的要求。",
	"A pact can range from a loose agreement to a formal contract with lengthy, detailed clauses and lists of requirements. The terms of a pact—what a warlock must do to receive a patron's favor—are always dictated by the patron. On occasion, those terms include a special proviso that might seem odd or whimsical, but warlocks take these dictates as seriously as they do the other requirements of their pacts.": "契约的范围可以是松散的协议，也可以是带有冗长、详细条款和要求清单的正式合同。契约的条款--一个术士必须做什么来获得赞助人的青睐--总是由赞助人决定的。有时，这些条款包括一个可能看起来很奇怪或异想天开的特殊条件，但术士们对这些规定的重视程度不亚于他们对契约的其他要求。",
	"Does your character have a pact that requires you to change your behavior in an unusual or seemingly frivolous way? Even if your patron hasn't imposed such a duty on you already, that's not to say it couldn't still happen.": "你的角色是否有一个契约，要求你以不寻常或看似轻浮的方式改变你的行为？即使你的赞助人还没有对你施加这样的责任，这并不是说它仍然不可能发生。",
	"When directed, you must take immediate action against a specific enemy of your patron.": "在得到指示时，你必须立即对你的主顾的特定敌人采取行动。",
	"Your pact tests your willpower; you are required to abstain from alcohol and other intoxicants.": "你的契约考验着你的意志力；你被要求戒酒和其他麻醉品。",
	"At least once a day, you must inscribe or carve your patron's name or symbol on the wall of a building.": "每天至少一次，你必须在建筑物的墙壁上题写或雕刻你的赞助人的名字或符号。",
	"You must occasionally conduct bizarre rituals to maintain your pact.": "你必须偶尔进行怪异的仪式来维持你的契约。",
	"You can never wear the same outfit twice, since your patron finds such predictability to be boring.": "你永远不能穿同样的衣服两次，因为你的主顾觉得这种可预测性很无聊。",
	"When you use an eldritch invocation, you must speak your patron's name aloud or risk incurring its displeasure.": "当你使用长生召唤时，你必须大声说出你的守护者的名字，否则有可能招致它的不悦。",
	"Some patrons make a habit of, and often enjoy, marking the warlocks under their sway in some fashion. A binding mark makes it clear—to those who know about such things—that the individual in question is bound to the patron's service. A warlock might take advantage of such a mark, claiming it as proof of one's pact, or might want to keep it under wraps (if possible) to avoid the difficulties it might bring.": "有些赞助人有一个习惯，而且常常喜欢在他们手下的术士身上打上某种标记。对于那些了解这种事情的人来说，一个约束性的标记清楚地表明，这个人被约束在赞助人的服务中。术士可能会利用这样的标记，声称它是自己契约的证明，或者可能想把它藏起来（如果可能的话），以避免它可能带来的困难。",
	"If your warlock's pact comes with a binding mark, how you feel about displaying it probably depends on the nature of your relationship with the one who gave it to you. Is the mark a source of pride or something you are secretly ashamed of?": "如果你的术士契约带有约束性标记，你对展示它的感觉可能取决于你与给予它的人的关系的性质。这个标记是你的骄傲，还是你暗自感到羞愧的东西？",
	"One of your eyes looks the same as one of your patron's eyes.": "你的一只眼睛和你的赞助人的一只眼睛看起来一样。",
	"Each time you wake up, the small blemish on your face appears in a different place.": "每次你醒来的时候，你脸上的小瑕疵都会出现在不同的地方。",
	"You display outward symptoms of a disease but suffer no ill effects from it.": "你表现出某种疾病的外在症状，但没有受到疾病的影响。",
	"Your tongue is an unnatural color.": "你的舌头是一种不自然的颜色。",
	"You have a vestigial tail.": "你有一个残缺的尾巴。",
	"Your nose glows in the dark.": "你的鼻子在黑暗中发亮。",
	"At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being chosen from the list of available patrons. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.": "在1级的时候，你已经和一个异世界的生物达成了协议，这个生物是从可用的赞助者名单中选择的。你的选择使你在1级时获得特性，在6级、10级和14级时再次获得特性。",
	"You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.": "你会从术士法术列表中选择两个咒语。在更高的等级中，你会学习更多你选择的术士咒语，如术士表中已知的咒语栏所示。",
	"At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.": "一级时，你会从术士法术列表中选择两个一级法术。",
	"The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.": "术士表的 \"已知法术 \"一栏显示了你何时学习更多你所选择的1级以上的术士法术。你所选择的法术的等级必须不高于表格中你的等级的插槽等级栏所显示的等级。例如，当你达到6级时，你会学习一个新的术士法术，它可以是1级、2级或3级。",
	"Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.": "此外，当你在这个等级中获得一个级别时，你可以从你所知道的术士法术中选择一个，并用术士法术列表中的另一个法术来代替它，这个法术也必须是你有法术槽的级别。",
	"Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one spell you learned from this Pact Magic feature with another spell from the warlock spell list. The new spell must be the same level as the spell you replace.": "每当你完成一个长时间的休息，你可以用术士法术列表中的另一个法术替换你从这个契约魔法特征中学到的一个法术。新的法术必须与你替换的法术同等级。",

	"Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing a change of focus in your occult studies:": "每当你在这个等级中达到一个授予能力分数提高功能的等级时，你可以做以下一件事，代表你的神秘学研究重点的改变。",
	"Replace the option you chose for the Pact Boon feature with one of that feature's other options.": "用该功能的其他选项之一取代你为契约布恩功能选择的选项。",

	"Several features of the Lurker in the Deep create tentacles or a maw that reach into the world. The form of these appendages should reflect the nature of your specific patron.

When you or a creature you can see takes damage while within 10 feet of the tentacle, you can use your reaction to choose one of those creatures and reduce the damage to the chosen creature by half. After doing so, the tentacle vanishes.": "在6级时，你用 \"深海之握 \"创造的触手可以保护你和其他人。当你或你能看到的生物在触手的10英尺范围内受到伤害时，你可以用你的反应在这些生物中选择一个，并将所选生物的伤害减少一半。这样做之后，触手会消失。",
	"Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.": "一旦你使用这个功能，你就不能再这样做了，直到你完成一个短期或长期的休息。",

Once you use either effect, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.": "从14级开始，你获得向你的守护者求援的能力。作为一个行动，你在你30英尺范围内选择一个点，在那里你的守护者撕裂了现实，表现出它的某种程度的泰拉西式的宏伟。你可以选择以下一种效果从这个表现点发出。一旦你使用了这两个效果，你就不能再使用这个功能，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。",
	"You and up to five willing creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the manifestation point are grasped by spectral tentacles and yanked through your patron's realm.

	"At 6th level, you gain the ability to step into an astral refuge. As an action, you disappear from the world for a brief moment and enter the Astral Plane, taking advantage of its timeless nature.

After using those two actions, you return to the space you occupied and your turn ends.": "在6级时，你获得了踏入星界避难所的能力。作为一个行动，你会从世界上短暂地消失，进入星界，利用其永恒的性质。当你在星界避难所时，你可以采取两个行动来施展只针对你的法术。使用这两个行动后，你回到你所占据的空间，你的回合结束。",

	"You have made your pact with a powerful, sentient magic weapon carved from the stuff of the Shadowfell. The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, several of which have spread across the multiverse over the ages. These weapons grow stronger as they consume the life essence of their victims. The strongest of them can use their ties to the Shadowfell to offer power to mortals who serve them. The Raven Queen forged the first of these weapons. They, along with the hexblade warlocks, are another tool she can use to manipulate events in the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.": "你已经与一件强大的、有生命的魔法武器签订了契约，它是由阴影城的材料雕刻而成的。强大的黑泽尔剑是这些武器中最值得注意的，在过去的岁月中，有几把武器已经遍布多元宇宙。这些武器在吞噬受害者的生命精华时变得更加强大。最强大的武器可以利用它们与阴影地带的联系，为服务于它们的凡人提供力量。乌鸦女王铸造了第一批这样的武器。它们和六芒星术士一起，是她用来操纵物质世界事件的另一个工具，以达到她不可捉摸的目的。",

	"The Raven Queen's followers are expected to serve her will in the world. She concerns herself with ensuring that those fated to die pass from the world as expected, and bids her agents to defeat those who seek to cheat death through undeath or other imitations of immortality. She hates intelligent undead and expects her followers to strike them down, whereas mindless undead such as skeletons and zombies are little more than stumbling automatons in her eyes.": "乌鸦女王的追随者被期望在这个世界上为她的意志服务。她关心的是确保那些注定死亡的人如期离开这个世界，并要求她的代理人击败那些试图通过不死或其他不朽的模仿来欺骗死亡的人。她憎恨有智慧的亡灵，希望她的追随者能将其击倒，而无意识的亡灵，如骷髅和僵尸，在她眼里不过是蹒跚的自动装置。",
	"The Raven Queen lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.": "乌鸦女王让你在学习术士法术时从扩大的法术列表中进行选择。以下的法术会被添加到术士法术列表中，供你使用。",
	"You can see through the raven's eyes and hear what it hears while it is within 100 feet of you. In combat, you roll initiative for the raven and control how it acts. If it is slain by a creature, you gain advantage on all attack rolls against the killer for the next 24 hours.": "当它在你100英尺范围内时，你可以透过乌鸦的眼睛看到它，听到它所听到的声音。在战斗中，你为乌鸦掷出主动权并控制它的行动。如果它被一个生物杀死，在接下来的24小时内，你在所有针对杀手的攻击卷轴上获得优势。",

The raven vanishes when it dies, if you die, or if the two of you are separated by more than 5 miles.": "乌鸦不需要睡眠。当它在你的100英尺范围内时，它可以把你从睡眠中唤醒，作为一个额外的动作。当乌鸦死后，如果你死了，或者如果你们两个人分开超过5英里，乌鸦就会消失。",

	"You've made a pact with a deathless being, a creature that defies the cycle and life and death, forsaking its mortal shell so it might eternally pursue its unfathomable ambitions. For such beings, time and morality are fleeting things, the concerns of those for whom grains of sand still rush through life's hourglass. Having once been mortal themselves, these ancient undead know firsthand the paths of ambition and the routes past the doors of death. They eagerly share this profane knowledge, along with other secrets, with those who work their will among the living.": "你已经和一个不死的生命签订了协议，一个藐视循环和生死的生物，放弃了它的凡人外壳，以便它可以永远追求它深不可测的野心。对于这样的生命来说，时间和道德都是转瞬即逝的东西，是那些沙粒仍然在生命的沙漏中奔跑的人所关心的。由于曾经是凡人，这些古老的亡灵亲身了解野心之路以及穿越死亡之门的路线。他们热切地与那些在活人中实现其意志的人分享这些神圣的知识以及其他秘密。",
	"The appearance of your Form of Dread reflects some aspect of your patron. For example, your form could be a shroud of shadows forming the crown and robes of your lich patron, or your body might glow with glyphs from ancient funerary rites and be surrounded by desert winds, suggesting your mummy patron.": "你的恐惧之形的外观反映了你的守护者的某些方面。例如，你的形态可以是一个阴影的笼罩，形成你的巫师守护者的王冠和长袍，或者你的身体可能发出古代葬礼仪式的石刻，被沙漠之风包围，暗示你的木乃伊守护者。",
	"In addition, once during each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack roll and roll damage against the creature, you can replace the damage type with necrotic damage. While you are using your Form of Dread, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the necrotic damage the target takes.": "此外，在你的每个回合中，当你用攻击卷击中一个生物并对该生物卷出伤害时，你可以用坏死伤害取代伤害类型。当你使用你的恐惧形态时，你可以在决定目标所受的坏死伤害时，额外滚动一个伤害模子。",
	"Your spirit resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics but not your possessions. Any damage or other effects that apply to your spirit or physical body affects the other. Your spirit can remain outside your body for up to 1 hour or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). When your projection ends, your spirit returns to your body or your body magically teleports to your spirit's space (your choice).": "你的精神在几乎所有方面都与你的凡人形态相似，复制你的游戏统计数据，但不复制你的财产。任何适用于你的精神或肉体的伤害或其他效果都会影响另一个。你的精神可以在你的身体外停留长达1小时，或者直到你的注意力被打破（就像集中在一个法术上）。当你的投射结束时，你的精神回到你的身体，或者你的身体神奇地传送到你精神的空间（你选择）。",
	"When you cast a spell of the conjuration or necromancy school, the spell doesn't require verbal or somatic components or material components that lack a gold cost.": "当你施展法术或死灵学派的法术时，该法术不需要语言或体质成分或缺乏金币成本的物质成分。",
	"Your patron is a powerful being of the Upper Planes. You have bound yourself to an ancient empyrean, solar, ki-rin, unicorn, or other entity that resides in the planes of everlasting bliss. Your pact with that being allows you to experience the barest touch of the holy light that illuminates the multiverse.": "你的守护者是上层世界的强大存在。你已经把自己与一个古老的帝王、太阳、麒麟、独角兽或其他居住在永恒极乐世界的实体结合在一起。你与那个生命的契约使你能够体验到照亮多元宇宙的圣光的最基本的触觉。",
	"Being connected to such power can cause changes in your behavior and beliefs. You might find yourself driven to annihilate the undead, to defeat fiends, and to protect the innocent. At times, your heart might also be filled with a longing for the celestial realm of your patron, and a desire to wander that paradise for the rest of your days. But you know that your mission is among mortals for now, and that your pact binds you to bring light to the dark places of the world.": "与这种力量相连会导致你的行为和信仰的改变。你可能会发现自己被驱使去消灭亡灵，打败恶魔，保护无辜者。有时，你的内心也可能充满了对你的守护者的天界的渴望，并渴望在余下的日子里徜徉在那个天堂。但你知道，你的任务目前是在凡人中间，你的契约约束你把光明带到世界的黑暗处。",
	"As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool.

	"Starting at 6th level, your link to the Celestial allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have resistance to radiant damage, and when you cast a spell that deals radiant or fire damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to one radiant or fire damage roll of that spell against one of its targets.": "从6级开始，你与天神的联系使你可以作为辐射能量的通道。你对辐射伤害有抵抗力，当你施放一个造成辐射或火焰伤害的法术时，你可以在该法术对其中一个目标的辐射或火焰伤害卷中加入你的魅力修正值。",
	"Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.": "因为已知乌鸦女王铸造了这些武器中的第一件，许多圣人推测她和力量是一体的，这些武器和六芒星术士一起，是她用来操纵物质世界事件的工具，以达到她不可捉摸的目的。",
	"At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.": "一级时，你获得了有效武装自己进行战斗的必要训练。你获得对中型盔甲、盾牌和武术武器的熟练度。",
	"The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon's type.": "你的守护者的影响也允许你通过特定的武器神秘地引导你的意志。每当你完成一个长时间的休息，你就可以接触一件你精通的、没有双手属性的武器。当你用该武器进行攻击时，你可以使用你的魅力修改器，而不是力量或灵巧，来进行攻击和伤害卷。这个好处一直持续到你完成一个长时间的休息。如果你后来获得了 \"刀之契约 \"特性，这个好处将延伸到你用该特性变出的每个契约武器，无论武器的类型如何。",
	"If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).": "如果被诅咒的目标死亡，你会重新获得相当于你的术士等级+你的魅力修正值的命中率（最低为1个命中率）。",

	"As an action, you can magically vanish and enter your vessel, which remains in the space you left. The interior of the vessel is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 20-foot-radius cylinder, 20 feet high, and resembles your vessel. The interior is appointed with cushions and low tables and is a comfortable temperature. While inside, you can hear the area around your vessel as if you were in its space. You can remain inside the vessel up to a number of hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You exit the vessel early if you use a bonus action to leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the vessel's former space. Once you enter the vessel, you can't enter again until you finish a long rest.": "作为一个动作，你可以神奇地消失并进入你的容器，它仍然在你离开的空间里。容器的内部是一个超维空间，形状是一个半径为20英尺的圆柱体，高20英尺，与你的容器很相似。内部布置有坐垫和矮桌，温度舒适。在里面时，你可以听到你的船只周围的区域，就像你在它的空间里一样。你可以在船内停留的小时数等于你的熟练度奖励的两倍。如果你使用奖励动作离开，如果你死亡，或者如果船只被摧毁，你会提前离开船只。当你离开容器时，你会出现在离它最近的空位上。任何留在容器中的物体都会留在那里，直到被运出。如果容器被摧毁，存放在那里的每一个物体都会无害地出现在最靠近容器以前空间的未被占用的地方。一旦你进入这个容器，你就不能再进入，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。"
