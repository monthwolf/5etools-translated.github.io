	"A human clad in simple robes walks along a forest path. A gang of goblins emerges from the brush, arrows trained on him, their smiles wide at their good fortune of finding such easy prey for the legion's slave pens. Their smiles turn to shrieks of terror as the traveler grows to giant size and leaps at them, his staff now a deadly cudgel.": "一个身着简单长袍的人类沿着林间小路走着。一群地精从灌木丛中走出来，用箭瞄准他，他们为自己能找到如此容易的猎物而笑得合不拢嘴，为军团的奴隶栏而笑得很开心。他们的笑容变成了恐怖的尖叫，因为这个旅行者长成了巨人，向他们跃去，他的法杖现在成了致命的棍棒。",
	"The militia forms in ranks to prepare for the orcs' charge. The growling brutes howl their battle cries and surge forward. To their surprise, the human rabble holds its ground and fights with surprising ferocity. Suddenly, mindless fear clings to the orcs' minds and they, despite facing a far inferior foe, turn and run, never noticing the calm half-elf standing amid the militia and directing its efforts.": "民兵们排成队伍，准备迎接兽人的冲锋。咆哮的野蛮人嚎叫着发出战斗的呐喊，向前猛冲。令他们惊讶的是，人类的乌合之众坚守阵地，并以惊人的凶猛进行战斗。突然间，无意识的恐惧笼罩着兽人的头脑，尽管他们面对的是一个远不如他们的敌人，但他们转身就跑，从未注意到站在民兵中间指挥他们工作的冷静半精灵。",
	"Baron von Ludwig was always proud of his grand library. Little did he know that each evening, a gnome laden with blank scrolls slipped past his guards each night and dutifully copied his most heavily guarded archives. When the duke's men arrived to arrest him for dealing with demons, he never guessed that the gnome scribe traveling with them had spent more time in his keep than he had over the past year.": "冯-路德维希男爵一直为他的大图书馆感到骄傲。他不知道，每天晚上，一个满载空白卷轴的地精都会从他的卫兵身边溜走，尽职尽责地抄写他最严密的档案。当公爵的人来到这里，以对付恶魔为由逮捕他时，他从未猜到与他们同行的地精文士在过去一年里在他的守卫中度过的时间比他还多。",
	"These heroes are all mystics, followers of a strange and mysterious form of power. Mystics shun the world to turn their eyes inward, mastering the full potential of their minds and exploring their psyches before turning to face the world. Mystics are incredibly rare, and most prefer to keep the nature of their abilities secret. Using their inner, psychic strength, they can read minds, fade into invisibility, transform their bodies into living iron, and seize control of the physical world and bend it to their will.": "这些英雄都是神秘主义者，是一种奇怪而神秘的力量形式的追随者。神秘主义者避开世界，将目光转向内部，掌握他们思想的全部潜力，在转向面对世界之前探索他们的心灵。神秘主义者是非常罕见的，而且大多数人宁愿对他们能力的性质保密。利用他们内在的精神力量，他们可以读心，淡化隐形，将自己的身体变成活生生的铁，并控制物质世界，使其服从自己的意志。",
	"Mystics are loners. Most discover the secrets of their power through vague references in tomes of lore or by ingratiating themselves to a master of the power.": "神秘主义者是独行侠。大多数人通过传说书中模糊的参考资料，或者通过与力量大师交好来发现他们力量的秘密。",
	"In order to master their power, mystics must first master themselves. They spend months and years in quiet contemplation, exploring their minds and leaving nothing uncovered. During this time, they shun society and typically live as hermits at the edge of society. A mystic who studied under a master worked as a virtual slave, toiling away at mundane tasks in return for the occasional lesson or cryptic insight.": "为了掌握他们的力量，神秘主义者必须首先掌握自己。他们花数月或数年时间静心沉思，探索自己的思想，不放过任何蛛丝马迹。在这段时间里，他们避开社会，通常作为隐士生活在社会的边缘。在大师门下学习的神秘主义者就像一个虚拟的奴隶，在平凡的工作中辛勤劳作，以换取偶尔的教训或隐秘的洞察力。",
	"When mystics finally master their power, they return to the world to broaden their horizons and practice their craft. Some mystics prefer to remain isolated, but those who become adventurers aren't content to remain on the fringe of the world.": "当神秘主义者最终掌握了他们的力量，他们就会回到世界上，拓宽他们的视野，练习他们的技艺。有些神秘主义者喜欢与世隔绝，但那些成为冒险家的人并不满足于停留在世界的边缘地带。",
	"In order to maintain the strict discipline and intense self-knowledge needed to tap into their power, mystics develop a variety of practices to keep their focus sharp.": "为了保持挖掘其力量所需的严格纪律和强烈的自知之明，神秘主义者发展出各种做法，以保持他们的注意力。",
	"These practices are reflected in taboos and quirks, strange little behaviors that govern a mystic's actions. These quirks are oaths or behavioral tics that help keep mystics in the proper frame of mind while maintaining perfect control over their minds and bodies.": "这些做法反映在禁忌和怪癖上，即支配神秘主义者行动的奇怪小行为。这些怪癖是誓言或行为上的抽搐，有助于使神秘主义者保持适当的心态，同时保持对其身心的完美控制。",
	"While these taboos are harmless, they help cast mystics as outsiders. Few feel accepted by society, and fewer still care to become integrated with it. To mystics, the life of the mind is where they feel most at home.": "虽然这些禁忌是无害的，但它们有助于使神秘主义者成为局外人。很少有人觉得自己被社会接受，更少有人愿意与社会融合。对神秘主义者来说，心灵的生活是他们感到最自在的地方。",
	"To add some texture to your mystic, consider the quirks your character has acquired. These behaviors have no game effect, but your character might become irritated or upset if forced to break them. They're a great roleplaying tool to add character to the game. You can roll on or pick from the table below, or create your own quirks. Aim to create two quirks, to give them more of a chance to come into play. Finally, consider why your character chose these behaviors. What do they say about your character's personality or background? Are they based on a specific incident or a belief?": "为了给你的神秘主义增加一些质感，考虑一下你的角色获得的怪癖。这些行为没有游戏效果，但如果你的角色被迫打破这些行为，可能会变得恼怒或不安。它们是一个很好的角色扮演工具，可以在游戏中增加性格。你可以在下面的表格中滚动或挑选，或者创造你自己的怪癖。争取创造两个怪癖，让它们有更多机会发挥作用。最后，考虑你的角色为什么选择这些行为。它们对你的角色的个性或背景有什么说明？它们是基于一个具体的事件或一个信念吗？",

This reduction can't be lessened in any way, and the reduction to your hit point maximum lasts until you finish a long rest.": "在10级时，你获得了牺牲你的身体耐久度来换取超能力的能力。在激活一个超能力技能时，你可以用你的生命值来支付其灵能点数成本，而不是使用任何灵能点数。你当前的生命值和生命值上限都会减少你花费的生命值数量。这种减少无法以任何方式减轻，并且对你的生命值上限的减少会持续直到你完成一次长休。",
