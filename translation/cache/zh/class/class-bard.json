	"Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind, conjured forth by the magic of her song—knowledge of the people who constructed the monument and the mythic saga it depicts.": "当她的手指在一个早已被遗忘的废墟中的古老纪念碑上划过时，一个穿着粗犷皮革的半精灵发现知识涌入她的脑海，被她的歌声的魔力所吸引--关于建造这个纪念碑的人和它所描述的神话传奇的知识。",
	"A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism. The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.": "一个严厉的人类战士有节奏地用剑敲击他的鳞甲，为他的战歌定下节奏，并劝说他的同伴们勇敢和英雄主义。他的歌声的魔力加强了他们的力量和勇气。",
	"Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions' words will be well received.": "一个地精边笑边调音，在聚集在一起的贵族们身上编织着她微妙的魔法，确保她的同伴们的话语会被很好地接受。",
	"Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.": "无论是学者、骑士还是恶棍，吟游诗人通过语言和音乐编织魔法，激励盟友，打击敌人，操纵思想，创造幻觉，甚至治疗伤口。",
	"The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.": "吟游诗人最大的优势是他们的多功能性。许多吟游诗人喜欢在战斗中站在一旁，用他们的魔法来激励他们的盟友，并从远处阻挠他们的敌人。但如果有必要，吟游诗人也能在近战中自卫，用他们的魔法来加强他们的剑和盔甲。他们的法术倾向于魅力和幻觉，而不是公然的破坏性法术。他们对许多学科都有广泛的知识，而且有一种天生的能力，使他们几乎能做好任何事情。吟游诗人成为他们致力于完善的天赋的大师，从音乐表演到深奥的知识。",
	"True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.": "真正的吟游诗人在这个世界上并不常见。不是每个在酒馆里唱歌的吟游诗人或在皇室宫廷里游荡的小丑都是吟游诗人。发现隐藏在音乐中的魔力需要艰苦的学习和某种程度的天赋，而大多数吟游诗人和吟游诗人缺乏这种天赋。不过，要发现这些表演者和真正的吟游诗人之间的区别可能很难。吟游诗人的生活是在这片土地上游荡，收集传说，讲述故事，并依靠观众的感激之情生活，就像其他艺人一样。但是，知识的深度、音乐技巧的水平和魔法的触角使吟游诗人与他们的伙伴们不同。",
	"Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.": "吟游诗人很少在一个地方长期定居，他们对旅行的天然渴望--寻找新的故事，学习新的技能，以及超越地平线的新发现--使冒险生涯成为一种自然的召唤。每一次冒险都是一次学习的机会，可以练习各种技能，进入被遗忘已久的坟墓，发现失落的魔法作品，破译古老的书籍，前往陌生的地方，或遇到异国的生物。吟游诗人喜欢陪伴英雄，亲身见证他们的事迹。一个吟游诗人如果能从个人经历中讲述一个令人敬畏的故事，就能在其他吟游诗人中赢得声誉。事实上，在讲述了这么多关于英雄完成伟大事业的故事后，许多吟游诗人将这些主题铭记在心，并自己承担起英雄的角色。",
	"Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character's background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood. There's no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or other supernatural creatures.": "吟游诗人以故事为生，无论这些故事是真是假。你的角色的背景和动机并不像他或她所讲述的故事那样重要。也许你有一个安全而平凡的童年。这没有什么好的故事可讲，所以你可能会把自己描绘成一个被巫婆在凄凉的沼泽地里养大的孤儿。或者你的童年可能值得一说。有些吟游诗人通过非同寻常的方式获得他们的魔法音乐，包括受到精灵或其他超自然生物的启发。",
	"Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?": "你是否当过学徒，在一位大师手下学习，跟随更有经验的吟游诗人，直到你准备好独自出击？或者你上过大学，在那里学习吟游诗人的传说并练习你的音乐魔法？也许你是一个年轻的离家出走者或孤儿，被一个流浪的吟游诗人结识，成为你的导师。或者你可能是一个被宠坏的贵族孩子，由一个大师辅导。也许你偶然落入一个巫婆的魔掌，除了生命和自由之外，还为一个音乐礼物做了交易，但代价是什么？",
	"Music is the fruit of the divine tree that vibrates with the Words of Creation. But the question I ask you is, can a bard go to the root of this tree? Can one tap into the source of that power? Ah, then what manner of music they would bring to this world!": "音乐是神圣之树的果实，它与创造之言一起振动。但我要问你的问题是，吟游诗人能不能走到这棵树的根部？能否挖掘出这种力量的源泉？啊，那么他们会给这个世界带来怎样的音乐！？",
	"Bards bring levity during grave times; they impart wisdom to offset ignorance; and they make the ridiculous seem sublime. Bards are preservers of ancient history, their songs and tales perpetuating the memory of great events down through time—knowledge so important that it is memorized and passed along as oral history, to survive even when no written record remains.": "吟游诗人在严肃的时代带来了欢乐；他们传授智慧以抵消无知；他们使荒唐的事情显得崇高。吟游诗人是古代历史的保护者，他们的歌声和故事使伟大事件的记忆在时间上得以延续，这些知识如此重要，以至于被记住并作为口述历史流传下来，即使没有书面记录也能存活。",
	"It is also the bard's role to chronicle smaller and more contemporary events—the stories of today's heroes, including their feats of valor as well as their less than impressive failures.": "吟游诗人的职责还包括记录更小的当代事件--当今英雄的故事，包括他们的英勇事迹以及他们不那么令人印象深刻的失败。",
	"Of course, the world has many people who can carry a tune or tell a good story, and there's much more to any adventuring bard than a glib tongue and a melodious voice. Yet what truly sets bards apart from others—and from one another—are the style and substance of their performances.": "当然，这个世界上有很多人都会弹奏曲子或讲一个好故事，任何一个冒险的吟游诗人都有比花言巧语和悠扬的声音更多的东西。然而，真正使吟游诗人有别于其他人的，以及彼此之间的，是他们的表演风格和内容。",
	"You can add some unique aspects to your bard character by considering the suggestions that follow.": "你可以通过考虑下面的建议为你的吟游诗人角色增加一些独特的方面。",
	"Every successful bard is renowned for at least one piece of performance art, typically a song or a poem that is popular with everyone who hears it. These performances are spoken about for years by those who view them, and some spectators have had their lives forever changed because of the experience.": "每个成功的吟游诗人都至少以一件表演艺术而闻名，通常是一首歌曲或一首诗，听到的人都很喜欢。这些表演被观看的人说了很多年，一些观众的生活也因为这次经历而永远改变。",
	"If your character is just starting out, your ultimate defining work is likely in the future. But in order to make any sort of living at your profession, chances are you already have a piece or two in your repertoire that have proven to be audience pleasers.": "如果你的角色刚刚起步，你最终的决定性作品可能是在未来。但是，为了在你的职业中获得任何形式的生计，你有可能在你的剧目中已经有一两部被证明是观众喜欢的作品。",
	"\"Waltz of the Myconids,\" an upbeat tune that children in particular enjoy": "\"菌类圆舞曲》，这是一首欢快的曲子，儿童特别喜欢。",
	"\"Asmodeus's Golden Arse,\" a dramatic poem you claim was inspired by your personal visit to Avernus": "\"阿斯莫德的金屁股\"，一首戏剧性的诗歌，你声称其灵感来自你对阿弗纳斯的个人访问",
	"\"The Pirates of Luskan,\" your firsthand account of being kidnapped by sea reavers as a child": "\"卢斯坎的海盗\"，你在童年时被海盗绑架的第一手资料",
	"\"A Hoop, Two Pigeons, and a Hell Hound,\" a subtle parody of an incompetent noble": "\"一个箍、两只鸽子和一只地狱猎犬\"，对无能的贵族进行了巧妙的模仿",
	"\"A Fool in the Abyss,\" a comedic poem about a jester's travels among demons": "\"深渊中的傻瓜\"，一首关于一个小丑在恶魔中旅行的喜剧诗",
	"In a bard's quest for the ultimate performance and the highest acclaim, one's instrument is at least as important as one's vocal ability. The instrument's quality of manufacture is a critical factor, of course; the best ones make the best music, and some bards are continually on the lookout for an improvement. Perhaps just as important, though, is the instrument's own entertainment value; those that are bizarrely constructed or made of exotic materials are likely to leave a lasting impression on an audience.": "在一个吟游诗人对终极表演和最高赞誉的追求中，一个人的乐器至少和他的歌唱能力一样重要。当然，乐器的制造质量是一个关键因素；最好的乐器能奏出最好的音乐，一些吟游诗人不断地在寻找改进。不过，也许同样重要的是乐器本身的娱乐价值；那些结构奇特或由异国材料制成的乐器可能会给听众留下持久的印象。",
	"You might have an \"off the rack\" instrument, perhaps because it's all you can afford right now. Or, if your first instrument was gifted to you, it might be of a more elaborate sort. Are you satisfied with the instrument you have, or do you aspire to replace it with something truly distinctive?": "你可能有一个 \"现成的 \"乐器，也许是因为这是你现在唯一能负担得起的。或者，如果你的第一把琴是别人送给你的，它可能是更精致的那种。你是否对你所拥有的乐器感到满意，或者你是否渴望用真正独特的东西来取代它？",
	"A masterfully crafted halfling fiddle": "一把制作精良的半身人小提琴",
	"A zither made with drow spider silk": "用乌鸦的蜘蛛丝制作的古筝",
	"A wooden bullywug croak box": "一个木制小霸王呱呱叫箱",
	"A tinker's harp of gnomish design": "侏儒设计的工匠竖琴",
	"Almost every bard has suffered at least one bad experience in front of an audience, and chances are you're no exception. No one becomes famous right away, after all; perhaps you had a few small difficulties early in your career, or maybe it took you a while to restore your reputation after one agonizing night when the fates conspired to bring about your theatrical ruin.": "几乎每个吟游诗人都至少在观众面前有过一次糟糕的经历，而你有可能也不例外。毕竟，没有人能够立即成名；也许你在职业生涯的早期遇到过一些小困难，或者在一个痛苦的夜晚，命运之神密谋让你的戏剧毁于一旦，你花了一段时间才恢复了自己的声誉。",
	"The ways that a performance can go wrong are as varied as the fish in the sea. No matter what sort of disaster might occur, however, a bard has the courage and the confidence to rebound from it—either pressing on with the show (if possible) or promising to come back tomorrow with a new performance that's guaranteed to please.": "一场演出出错的方式就像海里的鱼一样多。然而，无论发生什么样的灾难，吟游诗人都有勇气和信心从中反弹--要么继续演出（如果可能的话），要么承诺明天带着新的表演回来，保证让人满意。",
	"The time when your comedic song, \"Big Tom's Hijinks\"—which, by the way, you thought was brilliant—did not go over well with Big Tom": "当你的喜剧歌曲《大汤姆的玩笑》--顺便说一下，你认为这首歌很精彩--没有得到大汤姆的青睐时。",
	"The matinee performance when a circus's owlbear got loose and terrorized the crowd": "日场演出时，马戏团的猫头鹰熊松开了手，吓坏了观众。",
	"When your opening song was your enthusiastic but universally hated rendition of \"Song of the Froghemoth\"": "当你的开场曲是你热情但普遍讨厌的 \"蛙人之歌 \"的改编时",
	"The time on stage when your wig caught fire and you threw it down—which set fire to the stage": "在舞台上，你的假发着火了，你把它扔了下来--这让舞台着火了。",
	"Naturally, every bard has a repertoire of songs and stories. Some bards are generalists who can draw from a wide range of topics for each performance, and who take pride in their versatility. Others adopt a more personal approach to their art, driven by their attachment to a muse—a particular concept that inspires much of what those bards do in front of an audience.": "自然，每个吟游诗人都有一个歌曲和故事的剧目。有些吟游诗人是通才，每次表演都能从广泛的主题中汲取营养，他们为自己的多才多艺感到自豪。另一些人对他们的艺术采取了更个人化的方法，由他们对某位大师的依恋所驱动--这种特殊的概念激发了这些吟游诗人在观众面前的大部分表现。",
	"A bard who follows a muse generally does so to gain a deeper understanding of what that muse represents and how to best convey that understanding to others through performance.": "一个追随缪斯的吟游诗人通常是为了更深入地了解该缪斯所代表的内容，以及如何通过表演将这种理解最好地传达给他人。",
	"If your bard character has a muse, it could be one of the three described here, or one of your own devising.": "如果你的吟游诗人角色有一个缪斯，它可以是这里描述的三个之一，也可以是你自己设计的一个。",
	"You feel a kinship with the natural world, and its beauty and mystery inspire you. For you, a tree is deeply symbolic, its roots delving into the dark unknown to draw forth the power of the earth, while its branches reach toward the sun to nourish their flowers and fruit. Nature is the ancient witness who has seen every kingdom rise and fall, even those whose names have been forgotten and wait to be rediscovered. The gods of nature share their secrets with druids and sages, opening their hearts and minds to new ways of seeing, and as with those individuals, you find that your creativity blossoms while you wander in an open field of waving grass or walk in silent reverence through a grove of ancient oaks.": "你对自然界有一种亲近感，它的美丽和神秘激励着你。对你来说，一棵树具有深刻的象征意义，它的根部深入到黑暗的未知世界，以汲取大地的力量，而它的枝条则伸向太阳，以滋养它们的花朵和果实。大自然是古老的见证者，它见证了每一个王国的兴衰，甚至那些名字已经被遗忘、等待被重新发现的王国。自然之神与德鲁伊和圣人分享他们的秘密，向他们的心灵和思想敞开新的观察方式，就像那些人一样，当你在一片挥舞着青草的空地上漫步时，或者在一片古老的橡树林中默默敬畏地行走时，你会发现你的创造力绽放。",
	"You are on a quest to identify the essence of true love. Though you do not disdain the superficial love of flesh and form, the deeper form of love that can inspire thousands or bring joy to one's every moment is what you are interested in. Love of this sort takes on many forms, and you can see its presence everywhere—from the sparkling of a beautiful gem to the song of a simple fisher thanking the sea for its bounty. You are on the trail of love, that most precious and mysterious of emotions, and your search fills your stories and your songs with vitality and passion.": "你正在寻求确定真爱的本质。虽然你并不蔑视肉体和形式的肤浅之爱，但你感兴趣的是更深层次的爱，它能激励成千上万的人，或为一个人的每一刻带来欢乐。这种爱有多种形式，你到处都能看到它的存在--从一颗美丽的宝石的闪光到一个简单的渔民感谢大海赐予的歌曲。你在追寻爱，这种最珍贵、最神秘的情感，你的寻找使你的故事和歌曲充满了活力和激情。",
	"Drama embodies conflict, and the best stories have conflict as a key element. From the morning-after tale of a tavern brawl to the saga of an epic battle, from a lover's spat to a rift between powerful dynasties, conflict is what inspires tale-tellers like you to create your best work. Conflict can bring out the best in some people, causing their heroic nature to shine forth and transform the world, but it can cause others to gravitate toward darkness and fall under the sway of evil. You strive to experience or witness all forms of conflict, great and small, so as to study this eternal aspect of life and immortalize it in your words and music.": "戏剧体现了冲突，而最好的故事都有冲突作为关键因素。从酒馆争吵的清晨故事到史诗般的战斗传奇，从情人的争吵到强大王朝之间的裂痕，冲突是激励像你这样的故事家创作出最好作品的原因。冲突可以激发一些人的优点，使他们的英雄本色闪耀出来，改变世界，但它也可能使其他人倾向于黑暗，陷入邪恶的摇摆之中。你努力体验或见证所有形式的冲突，无论大小，以便研究生命的这一永恒的方面，并在你的文字和音乐中使之不朽。",
	"You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.": "你可以使用这个功能的次数等于你的魅力修改器（最少一次）。当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你会重新获得任何已消耗的使用次数。",
	"If a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from you and casts a spell, the creature can roll that die and add the number rolled to one damage or healing roll of the spell. The Bardic Inspiration die is then lost.": "如果一个生物从你那里得到一个吟游诗人灵感的骰子并施展了一个法术，这个生物可以掷出那个骰子并将掷出的数字加到该法术的一个伤害或治疗卷上。然后，吟游诗人的灵感模子就会消失。",
	"Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one spell you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another spell from the bard spell list. The new spell must be the same level as the spell you replace.": "每当你完成一个长时间的休息，你可以用吟游诗人法术列表中的另一个法术替换你从这个法术功能中学到的一个法术。新的法术必须与你替换的法术同等级。",

	"If a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from you and casts a spell that restores hit points or deals damage, the creature can roll that die and choose a target affected by the spell. Add the number rolled as a bonus to the hit points regained or the damage dealt.

With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.": "英勇学院的吟游诗人是大胆的游侠，他们的故事使过去伟大英雄的记忆得以延续，从而激励了新一代的英雄。这些吟游诗人聚集在蜂蜜酒馆或大篝火旁，歌唱过去和现在的强者的事迹。他们走遍大地，亲身见证伟大的事件，并确保这些事件的记忆不会从世界上消失。通过他们的歌声，他们激励其他人达到与古代英雄同样的成就高度。",

	"Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.": "同样在3级，你学会了在战斗中激励他人。一个从你那里获得了吟游诗人灵感模子的生物可以掷出该模子，并将掷出的数字加入它刚刚做出的武器伤害卷。或者，当一个攻击卷对该生物进行攻击时，它可以在看到该卷之后，但在知道是否命中之前，用它的反应来滚动吟游诗人灵感的骰子，并将所滚动的数字加到它对该攻击的反击上。",

They are expected to mock and provoke, taking advantage of how even the most powerful folk are expected by tradition to endure a jester's barbs with good humor. This expectation allows a jester to serve as a critic or a voice of reason when others are too intimidated to speak the truth.": "虽然小丑是双关语、笑话和言语攻击的大师，但他们不仅仅是滑稽的救济。他们被期望嘲弄和挑衅，利用即使是最有权势的人也被传统地期望以良好的幽默感来忍受小丑的嘲弄。这种期望使小丑能够在其他人被吓得不敢说真话的时候充当批评家或理性的声音。",
	"For the duchess with a taste for strapping young laborers, such tales might serve to warn the targets of her affections and force her to change her ways for lack of willing partners. Striking back at the jester only ruins her already damaged reputation, and might provide the best evidence that the jester's satires have hit their mark. But if she is kind and generous to her conquests, the jokes and stories cast her as a kind of folk hero, while drawing even more potential partners to her.": "对于喜欢魁梧的年轻劳动者的公爵夫人来说，这样的故事可能有助于警告她的感情目标，迫使她因缺乏自愿的伙伴而改变自己的方式。反击小丑只会毁掉她已经受损的声誉，并可能提供最好的证据，证明小丑的讽刺击中了她的要害。但是，如果她对她的征服者仁慈而慷慨，笑话和故事就会把她塑造成一种民间英雄，同时吸引更多的潜在伙伴来找她。",
	"Jesters adventure to safeguard the common folk and to undermine the plans of the rich, powerful, and arrogant. Their magic bolsters allies' spirits while casting doubt into foes' minds. Among bards, jesters are unmatched acrobats, and their ability to tumble, dodge, leap, and climb makes them slippery opponents in battle.": "戏子们的冒险是为了保护普通民众，破坏富人、权贵和傲慢者的计划。他们的魔法使盟友精神振奋，同时将怀疑投向敌人的头脑。在吟游诗人中，小丑是无与伦比的杂技演员，他们翻滚、躲避、跳跃和攀爬的能力使他们在战斗中成为滑稽的对手。",
	"At 3rd level, you master a variety of acrobatic techniques that allow you to evade danger. As a bonus action, you can tumble. When you tumble, you gain the following benefits for the rest of your turn:": "在3级时，你掌握了各种杂技技巧，使你能够躲避危险。作为一个额外动作，你可以翻滚。当你翻滚时，你会在剩下的回合中获得以下好处。",
	"You gain a climbing speed equal to your current speed.": "你获得与你当前速度相等的爬升速度。",
	"You take half damage from falling.": "你因坠落而受到一半的伤害。",
	"At 6th level, your ability to gather stories and lore gains a supernatural edge. You can cast detect thoughts up to a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You regain any expended uses of this ability after completing a long rest.": "6级时，你收集故事和传说的能力获得了超自然的优势。你可以施展探测思想的能力，其次数与你的魅力修正值相等。在完成长时间的休息后，你会重新获得这个能力的任何消耗。",
	"If a creature resists your attempt to probe deeper and succeeds at its saving throw against your detect thoughts, it immediately suffers an embarrassing social gaffe. It might loudly pass gas, unleash a thunderous burp, trip and fall, or be compelled to tell a tasteless joke.": "如果一个生物抵制了你深入探究的尝试，并成功地对你的思想探测进行了救赎，它就会立即遭受一个尴尬的社交失误。它可能会大声放屁，打出一个雷鸣般的嗝，绊倒在地，或者被迫说出一个无味的笑话。",
	"Jesters seem to have a knack for pulling themselves out of tight situations, transforming what looks like sure failure into an embarrassing but effective success.": "戏子们似乎有一种把自己从困境中拉出来的诀窍，把看起来肯定会失败的事情转变为令人尴尬但有效的成功。",
	"At 14th level, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration after you fail an ability check, fail a saving throw, or miss with an attack roll. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your attack, saving throw, or ability check, using the new result in place of the failed one.": "在14级时，你可以在能力检查失败、自救失败或攻击失败后使用一次吟游诗人的灵感。掷一个吟游诗人的骰子，并将掷出的数字加入你的攻击、蓄力或能力检查，用新的结果代替失败的结果。",
	"Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and they entertain through daring feats of weapon prowess. Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. But though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right.": "剑术学院的吟游诗人被称为 \"刀片\"，他们通过大胆的武器技能表演进行娱乐。刀锋表演特技，如吞剑、扔刀和杂耍，以及模拟战斗。但是，尽管他们用武器来娱乐，他们本身也是训练有素、技艺高超的战士。",
	"Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a blade's talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust them.": "他们在武器方面的天赋激励着许多刀锋战士过着双重生活。一个刀锋战士可能以马戏团为掩护，从事暗杀、抢劫和勒索等邪恶的行为。其他刀锋战士则打击邪恶的人，对残忍和强大的人伸张正义。大多数马戏团很乐意接受刀锋战士的才能，因为它为演出增添了刺激，但很少有艺人完全信任他们。",
	"Blades who abandon lives as entertainers have often run into trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is too great a liability for most performer troupes. With their weapon skills as their greatest asset, these blades either take up work as enforcers for thieves' guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.": "放弃艺人生活的刀锋经常遇到麻烦，使他们无法维持秘密活动。对于大多数表演团体来说，被抓到偷窃或参与私刑的刀锋战士是一个巨大的责任。由于他们的武器技能是他们最大的资产，这些刀锋战士要么担任盗贼行会的执行者，要么作为冒险家独自出击。",
	"This favorite trick of knife throwers allows you to expend one use of Bardic Inspiration as a bonus action. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and apply the number rolled as a bonus to the next ranged attack roll you make with a dagger this turn. If the target of the attack is an unattended, inanimate object, the bonus equals double the die roll.": "这个投刀者最喜欢的把戏允许你使用一次吟游诗人的灵感作为奖励动作。掷一个吟游诗人灵感的骰子，并将掷出的数字作为奖励应用到你本回合用匕首进行的下一次远程攻击中。如果攻击的目标是一个无人看管的无生命物体，那么该奖励等于掷骰子的两倍。",
	"Your deadly display of combat prowess unnerves your opponents, leaving them cowering in fear and at your mercy. Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, you can use a bonus action to expend one use of Bardic Inspiration, and instead leave the creature at 1 hit point.": "你致命的战斗能力让你的对手感到不安，让他们在恐惧中畏缩，任由你摆布。每当你用近战攻击将一个生物的命中率降为0时，你可以使用一个额外的动作来消耗一次吟游诗人的灵感，而使该生物的命中率为1。",

	"If the attack hits its target, you can expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to damage each creature of your choice, other than the target, that you can see within 5 feet of you.
