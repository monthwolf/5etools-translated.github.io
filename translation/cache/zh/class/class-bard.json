	"Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind, conjured forth by the magic of her song—knowledge of the people who constructed the monument and the mythic saga it depicts.": "当她的手指在一个早已被遗忘的废墟中的古老纪念碑上划过时，一个穿着粗犷皮革的半精灵发现知识涌入她的脑海，被她的歌声的魔力所吸引--关于建造这个纪念碑的人和它所描述的神话传奇的知识。",
	"A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism. The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.": "一个严厉的人类战士有节奏地用剑敲击他的鳞甲，为他的战歌定下节奏，并劝说他的同伴们勇敢和英雄主义。他的歌声的魔力加强了他们的力量和勇气。",
	"Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions' words will be well received.": "一个地精边笑边调音，在聚集在一起的贵族们身上编织着她微妙的魔法，确保她的同伴们的话语会被很好地接受。",
	"Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.": "无论是学者、骑士还是恶棍，吟游诗人通过语言和音乐编织魔法，激励盟友，打击敌人，操纵思想，创造幻觉，甚至治疗伤口。",
	"In the worlds of D&D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.": "在D&D的世界里，语言和音乐不仅仅是空气的振动，而是具有自己的力量的发声。吟游诗人是歌曲、语言和它们所包含的魔法的大师。吟游诗人说，多元宇宙是用语言表达出来的，诸神的话语赋予了它形状，而这些原始的创造之语的回声仍然响彻整个宇宙。吟游诗人的音乐就是试图攫取和利用这些回声，巧妙地编织成他们的法术和力量。",
	"The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.": "吟游诗人最大的优势是他们的多功能性。许多吟游诗人喜欢在战斗中站在一旁，用他们的魔法来激励他们的盟友，并从远处阻挠他们的敌人。但如果有必要，吟游诗人也能在近战中自卫，用他们的魔法来加强他们的剑和盔甲。他们的法术倾向于魅力和幻觉，而不是公然的破坏性法术。他们对许多学科都有广泛的知识，而且有一种天生的能力，使他们几乎能做好任何事情。吟游诗人成为他们致力于完善的天赋的大师，从音乐表演到深奥的知识。",
	"True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.": "真正的吟游诗人在这个世界上并不常见。不是每个在酒馆里唱歌的吟游诗人或在皇室宫廷里游荡的小丑都是吟游诗人。发现隐藏在音乐中的魔力需要艰苦的学习和某种程度的天赋，而大多数吟游诗人和吟游诗人缺乏这种天赋。不过，要发现这些表演者和真正的吟游诗人之间的区别可能很难。吟游诗人的生活是在这片土地上游荡，收集传说，讲述故事，并依靠观众的感激之情生活，就像其他艺人一样。但是，知识的深度、音乐技巧的水平和魔法的触角使吟游诗人与他们的伙伴们不同。",
	"Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.": "吟游诗人很少在一个地方长期定居，他们对旅行的天然渴望--寻找新的故事，学习新的技能，以及超越地平线的新发现--使冒险生涯成为一种自然的召唤。每一次冒险都是一次学习的机会，可以练习各种技能，进入被遗忘已久的坟墓，发现失落的魔法作品，破译古老的书籍，前往陌生的地方，或遇到异国的生物。吟游诗人喜欢陪伴英雄，亲身见证他们的事迹。一个吟游诗人如果能从个人经历中讲述一个令人敬畏的故事，就能在其他吟游诗人中赢得声誉。事实上，在讲述了这么多关于英雄完成伟大事业的故事后，许多吟游诗人将这些主题铭记在心，并自己承担起英雄的角色。",
	"Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character's background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood. There's no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or other supernatural creatures.": "吟游诗人以故事为生，无论这些故事是真是假。你的角色的背景和动机并不像他或她所讲述的故事那样重要。也许你有一个安全而平凡的童年。这没有什么好的故事可讲，所以你可能会把自己描绘成一个被巫婆在凄凉的沼泽地里养大的孤儿。或者你的童年可能值得一说。有些吟游诗人通过非同寻常的方式获得他们的魔法音乐，包括受到精灵或其他超自然生物的启发。",
	"Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?": "你是否当过学徒，在一位大师手下学习，跟随更有经验的吟游诗人，直到你准备好独自出击？或者你上过大学，在那里学习吟游诗人的传说并练习你的音乐魔法？也许你是一个年轻的离家出走者或孤儿，被一个流浪的吟游诗人结识，成为你的导师。或者你可能是一个被宠坏的贵族孩子，由一个大师辅导。也许你偶然落入一个巫婆的魔掌，除了生命和自由之外，还为一个音乐礼物做了交易，但代价是什么？",
	"You can make a bard quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the {@background entertainer} background. Third, choose the {@spell dancing lights} and {@spell vicious mockery} cantrips, along with the following 1st-level spells: {@spell charm person}, {@spell detect magic}, {@spell healing word}, and {@spell thunderwave}.": "按照这些建议，你可以迅速成为一个吟游诗人。首先，魅力应该是你最高的能力分数，其次是灵巧。第二，选择{@background entertainer}的背景。第三，选择{@spell dancing lights}和{@spell vicious mockery}的咒语，以及以下一级法术。{@spell charm person}, {@spell detect magic}, {@spell healing word}, 和 {@spell thunderwave}。",
	"Music is the fruit of the divine tree that vibrates with the Words of Creation. But the question I ask you is, can a bard go to the root of this tree? Can one tap into the source of that power? Ah, then what manner of music they would bring to this world!": "音乐是神圣之树的果实，它与创造之言一起振动。但我要问你的问题是，吟游诗人能不能走到这棵树的根部？能否挖掘出这种力量的源泉？啊，那么他们会给这个世界带来怎样的音乐！？",
	"Bards bring levity during grave times; they impart wisdom to offset ignorance; and they make the ridiculous seem sublime. Bards are preservers of ancient history, their songs and tales perpetuating the memory of great events down through time—knowledge so important that it is memorized and passed along as oral history, to survive even when no written record remains.": "吟游诗人在严肃的时代带来了欢乐；他们传授智慧以抵消无知；他们使荒唐的事情显得崇高。吟游诗人是古代历史的保护者，他们的歌声和故事使伟大事件的记忆在时间上得以延续，这些知识如此重要，以至于被记住并作为口述历史流传下来，即使没有书面记录也能存活。",
	"It is also the bard's role to chronicle smaller and more contemporary events—the stories of today's heroes, including their feats of valor as well as their less than impressive failures.": "吟游诗人的职责还包括记录更小的当代事件--当今英雄的故事，包括他们的英勇事迹以及他们不那么令人印象深刻的失败。",
	"Of course, the world has many people who can carry a tune or tell a good story, and there's much more to any adventuring bard than a glib tongue and a melodious voice. Yet what truly sets bards apart from others—and from one another—are the style and substance of their performances.": "当然，这个世界上有很多人都会弹奏曲子或讲一个好故事，任何一个冒险的吟游诗人都有比花言巧语和悠扬的声音更多的东西。然而，真正使吟游诗人有别于其他人的，以及彼此之间的，是他们的表演风格和内容。",
	"To grab and hold the attention of an audience, bards are typically flamboyant and outgoing when they perform. The most famous of them are essentially the D&D world's equivalent of pop stars. If you're playing a bard, consider using one of your favorite musicians as a role model for your character.": "为了吸引和保持观众的注意力，吟游诗人在表演时通常会很张扬和外向。他们中最有名的人基本上相当于D&D世界中的流行明星。如果你要扮演一个吟游诗人，可以考虑用你最喜欢的音乐家之一作为你的角色的榜样。",
	"You can add some unique aspects to your bard character by considering the suggestions that follow.": "你可以通过考虑下面的建议为你的吟游诗人角色增加一些独特的方面。",
	"Every successful bard is renowned for at least one piece of performance art, typically a song or a poem that is popular with everyone who hears it. These performances are spoken about for years by those who view them, and some spectators have had their lives forever changed because of the experience.": "每个成功的吟游诗人都至少以一件表演艺术而闻名，通常是一首歌曲或一首诗，听到的人都很喜欢。这些表演被观看的人说了很多年，一些观众的生活也因为这次经历而永远改变。",
	"If your character is just starting out, your ultimate defining work is likely in the future. But in order to make any sort of living at your profession, chances are you already have a piece or two in your repertoire that have proven to be audience pleasers.": "如果你的角色刚刚起步，你最终的决定性作品可能是在未来。但是，为了在你的职业中获得任何形式的生计，你有可能在你的剧目中已经有一两部被证明是观众喜欢的作品。",
	"\"The Three Flambinis,\" a ribald song concerning mistaken identities and unfettered desire": "\"The Three Flambinis\"，一首关于错误的身份和无拘无束的欲望的滑稽歌曲",

	"\"A Fool in the Abyss,\" a comedic poem about a jester's travels among demons": "\"深渊中的傻瓜\"，一首关于一个小丑在恶魔中旅行的喜剧诗",
	"In a bard's quest for the ultimate performance and the highest acclaim, one's instrument is at least as important as one's vocal ability. The instrument's quality of manufacture is a critical factor, of course; the best ones make the best music, and some bards are continually on the lookout for an improvement. Perhaps just as important, though, is the instrument's own entertainment value; those that are bizarrely constructed or made of exotic materials are likely to leave a lasting impression on an audience.": "在一个吟游诗人对终极表演和最高赞誉的追求中，一个人的乐器至少和他的歌唱能力一样重要。当然，乐器的制造质量是一个关键因素；最好的乐器能奏出最好的音乐，一些吟游诗人不断地在寻找改进。不过，也许同样重要的是乐器本身的娱乐价值；那些结构奇特或由异国材料制成的乐器可能会给听众留下持久的印象。",
	"You might have an \"off the rack\" instrument, perhaps because it's all you can afford right now. Or, if your first instrument was gifted to you, it might be of a more elaborate sort. Are you satisfied with the instrument you have, or do you aspire to replace it with something truly distinctive?": "你可能有一个 \"现成的 \"乐器，也许是因为这是你现在唯一能负担得起的。或者，如果你的第一把琴是别人送给你的，它可能是更精致的那种。你是否对你所拥有的乐器感到满意，或者你是否渴望用真正独特的东西来取代它？",

	"Almost every bard has suffered at least one bad experience in front of an audience, and chances are you're no exception. No one becomes famous right away, after all; perhaps you had a few small difficulties early in your career, or maybe it took you a while to restore your reputation after one agonizing night when the fates conspired to bring about your theatrical ruin.": "几乎每个吟游诗人都至少在观众面前有过一次糟糕的经历，而你有可能也不例外。毕竟，没有人能够立即成名；也许你在职业生涯的早期遇到过一些小困难，或者在一个痛苦的夜晚，命运之神密谋让你的戏剧毁于一旦，你花了一段时间才恢复了自己的声誉。",
	"The ways that a performance can go wrong are as varied as the fish in the sea. No matter what sort of disaster might occur, however, a bard has the courage and the confidence to rebound from it—either pressing on with the show (if possible) or promising to come back tomorrow with a new performance that's guaranteed to please.": "一场演出出错的方式就像海里的鱼一样多。然而，无论发生什么样的灾难，吟游诗人都有勇气和信心从中反弹--要么继续演出（如果可能的话），要么承诺明天带着新的表演回来，保证让人满意。",
	"The time when your comedic song, \"Big Tom's Hijinks\"—which, by the way, you thought was brilliant—did not go over well with Big Tom": "当你的喜剧歌曲《大汤姆的玩笑》--顺便说一下，你认为这首歌很精彩--没有得到大汤姆的青睐时。",

	"When you sat on your {@item lute|PHB} by mistake during the final stanza of \"Starlight Serenade\"": "当你在 \"星光小夜曲 \"的最后一节中错误地坐在你的{@item lute|PHB}上。",
	"Naturally, every bard has a repertoire of songs and stories. Some bards are generalists who can draw from a wide range of topics for each performance, and who take pride in their versatility. Others adopt a more personal approach to their art, driven by their attachment to a muse—a particular concept that inspires much of what those bards do in front of an audience.": "自然，每个吟游诗人都有一个歌曲和故事的剧目。有些吟游诗人是通才，每次表演都能从广泛的主题中汲取营养，他们为自己的多才多艺感到自豪。另一些人对他们的艺术采取了更个人化的方法，由他们对某位大师的依恋所驱动--这种特殊的概念激发了这些吟游诗人在观众面前的大部分表现。",
	"A bard who follows a muse generally does so to gain a deeper understanding of what that muse represents and how to best convey that understanding to others through performance.": "一个追随缪斯的吟游诗人通常是为了更深入地了解该缪斯所代表的内容，以及如何通过表演将这种理解最好地传达给他人。",
	"If your bard character has a muse, it could be one of the three described here, or one of your own devising.": "如果你的吟游诗人角色有一个缪斯，它可以是这里描述的三个之一，也可以是你自己设计的一个。",
	"You feel a kinship with the natural world, and its beauty and mystery inspire you. For you, a tree is deeply symbolic, its roots delving into the dark unknown to draw forth the power of the earth, while its branches reach toward the sun to nourish their flowers and fruit. Nature is the ancient witness who has seen every kingdom rise and fall, even those whose names have been forgotten and wait to be rediscovered. The gods of nature share their secrets with druids and sages, opening their hearts and minds to new ways of seeing, and as with those individuals, you find that your creativity blossoms while you wander in an open field of waving grass or walk in silent reverence through a grove of ancient oaks.": "你对自然界有一种亲近感，它的美丽和神秘激励着你。对你来说，一棵树具有深刻的象征意义，它的根部深入到黑暗的未知世界，以汲取大地的力量，而它的枝条则伸向太阳，以滋养它们的花朵和果实。大自然是古老的见证者，它见证了每一个王国的兴衰，甚至那些名字已经被遗忘、等待被重新发现的王国。自然之神与德鲁伊和圣人分享他们的秘密，向他们的心灵和思想敞开新的观察方式，就像那些人一样，当你在一片挥舞着青草的空地上漫步时，或者在一片古老的橡树林中默默敬畏地行走时，你会发现你的创造力绽放。",
	"You are on a quest to identify the essence of true love. Though you do not disdain the superficial love of flesh and form, the deeper form of love that can inspire thousands or bring joy to one's every moment is what you are interested in. Love of this sort takes on many forms, and you can see its presence everywhere—from the sparkling of a beautiful gem to the song of a simple fisher thanking the sea for its bounty. You are on the trail of love, that most precious and mysterious of emotions, and your search fills your stories and your songs with vitality and passion.": "你正在寻求确定真爱的本质。虽然你并不蔑视肉体和形式的肤浅之爱，但你感兴趣的是更深层次的爱，它能激励成千上万的人，或为一个人的每一刻带来欢乐。这种爱有多种形式，你到处都能看到它的存在--从一颗美丽的宝石的闪光到一个简单的渔民感谢大海赐予的歌曲。你在追寻爱，这种最珍贵、最神秘的情感，你的寻找使你的故事和歌曲充满了活力和激情。",
	"Drama embodies conflict, and the best stories have conflict as a key element. From the morning-after tale of a tavern brawl to the saga of an epic battle, from a lover's spat to a rift between powerful dynasties, conflict is what inspires tale-tellers like you to create your best work. Conflict can bring out the best in some people, causing their heroic nature to shine forth and transform the world, but it can cause others to gravitate toward darkness and fall under the sway of evil. You strive to experience or witness all forms of conflict, great and small, so as to study this eternal aspect of life and immortalize it in your words and music.": "戏剧体现了冲突，而最好的故事都有冲突作为关键因素。从酒馆争吵的清晨故事到史诗般的战斗传奇，从情人的争吵到强大王朝之间的裂痕，冲突是激励像你这样的故事家创作出最好作品的原因。冲突可以激发一些人的优点，使他们的英雄本色闪耀出来，改变世界，但它也可能使其他人倾向于黑暗，陷入邪恶的摇摆之中。你努力体验或见证所有形式的冲突，无论大小，以便研究生命的这一永恒的方面，并在你的文字和音乐中使之不朽。",
	"Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes.

	"Bards of the College of Satire are called jesters. They use lowbrow stories, daring acrobatics, and cutting jokes to entertain audiences, ranging from the crowds in a rundown dockside pub to the nobles of a king's royal court. Where other bards seek forgotten lore or tales of epic bravery, jesters ferret out embarrassing and hilarious stories of all kinds.

	"While jesters are masters of puns, jokes, and verbal barbs, they are much more than just comic relief. They are expected to mock and provoke, taking advantage of how even the most powerful folk are expected by tradition to endure a jester's barbs with good humor. This expectation allows a jester to serve as a critic or a voice of reason when others are too intimidated to speak the truth.": "虽然小丑是双关语、笑话和言语攻击的大师，但他们不仅仅是滑稽的救济。他们被期望嘲弄和挑衅，利用即使是最有权势的人也被传统地期望以良好的幽默感来忍受小丑的嘲弄。这种期望使小丑能够在其他人被吓得不敢说真话的时候充当批评家或理性的声音。",
	"For the duchess with a taste for strapping young laborers, such tales might serve to warn the targets of her affections and force her to change her ways for lack of willing partners. Striking back at the jester only ruins her already damaged reputation, and might provide the best evidence that the jester's satires have hit their mark. But if she is kind and generous to her conquests, the jokes and stories cast her as a kind of folk hero, while drawing even more potential partners to her.": "对于喜欢魁梧的年轻劳动者的公爵夫人来说，这样的故事可能有助于警告她的感情目标，迫使她因缺乏自愿的伙伴而改变自己的方式。反击小丑只会毁掉她已经受损的声誉，并可能提供最好的证据，证明小丑的讽刺击中了她的要害。但是，如果她对她的征服者仁慈而慷慨，笑话和故事就会把她塑造成一种民间英雄，同时吸引更多的潜在伙伴来找她。",
	"Jesters are loyal to only one cause: the pursuit and propagation of the truth. They use their comedy and innocuous appearance to break down social barriers and expose corruption, incompetence, and stupidity among the rich and powerful.

	"Jesters adventure to safeguard the common folk and to undermine the plans of the rich, powerful, and arrogant. Their magic bolsters allies' spirits while casting doubt into foes' minds. Among bards, jesters are unmatched acrobats, and their ability to tumble, dodge, leap, and climb makes them slippery opponents in battle.": "戏子们的冒险是为了保护普通民众，破坏富人、权贵和傲慢者的计划。他们的魔法使盟友精神振奋，同时将怀疑投向敌人的头脑。在吟游诗人中，小丑是无与伦比的杂技演员，他们翻滚、躲避、跳跃和攀爬的能力使他们在战斗中成为滑稽的对手。",

	"At 14th level, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration after you fail an ability check, fail a saving throw, or miss with an attack roll.
