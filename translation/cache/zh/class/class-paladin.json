	"Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.": "一个人类身穿板甲，尽管长期旅行的灰尘和污垢在阳光下闪闪发光，她放下剑和盾牌，把手放在一个受了致命伤的人身上。神圣的光辉从她的手中闪现，那人的伤口结实了，他惊讶地睁大眼睛。",
	"A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.": "一个矮人蹲在一块突出的岩石后面，他的黑色斗篷使他在夜里几乎看不见，看着一个兽人战队在庆祝最近的胜利。他悄悄地走到他们中间，低声说了一句誓言，两个兽人在意识到他的存在之前就已经死了。",
	"Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.": "银色的头发在似乎只照亮他的光轴中闪闪发光，一个精灵欣喜地笑了。他的长矛像他的眼睛一样闪烁着，他一次又一次地刺向一个扭曲的巨人，直到最后他的光芒战胜了巨人的可怕黑暗。",
	"Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.": "无论他们的出身和使命如何，圣骑士们都会因为他们的誓言而团结起来，对抗邪恶的力量。无论是在神坛和牧师的见证下宣誓，还是在自然之灵和精灵面前的圣地，或是在绝望和悲痛的时刻，以死者为唯一见证，圣骑士的誓言都是一种强大的纽带。它是一种力量的源泉，将一个虔诚的战士变成一个受祝福的冠军。",
	"A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.": "圣骑士发誓要维护正义和正直，与世界上的美好事物站在一起，对抗黑暗的侵袭，并在任何地方追捕邪恶势力。不同的圣骑士专注于正义事业的各个方面，但所有的圣骑士都受到誓言的约束，这些誓言赋予他们从事神圣工作的力量。尽管许多圣骑士都信奉善神，但圣骑士的力量既来自于对正义本身的承诺，也来自于对神的承诺。",
	"Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.": "几乎根据定义，圣骑士的生活是一种冒险的生活。除非有持久的伤痛使他或她有一段时间不能去冒险，否则每个圣骑士都生活在宇宙中与邪恶斗争的前线。在世界的民兵和军队中，战士已经很稀少了，但能宣称自己是圣骑士的真正召唤的人更少。当他们收到召唤时，这些战士就会放弃他们以前的职业，拿起武器与邪恶斗争。有时，他们的誓言使他们成为王室的服务对象，成为精英骑士团的领袖，但即使如此，他们的忠诚首先是对正义事业的忠诚，而不是对王室和国家。",
	"Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.": "冒险的圣骑士们认真对待他们的工作。深入古老的废墟或尘封的地窖可以是一次由更高目的驱动的探险，而不是为了获得宝藏。邪恶潜伏在地牢和原始森林中，即使是对它最小的胜利也能使宇宙的平衡偏离遗忘。",
	"How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin's life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.": "你是如何体验到作为圣骑士的召唤的？你是否在祈祷时听到一位看不见的神或天使的低语？是另一位圣骑士感觉到你的潜力并决定将你训练成一名侍从？或者是一些可怕的事件--也许是你的家园被毁--促使你去做你的任务？也许你无意中进入了一个神圣的小树林或一个隐藏的精灵飞地，发现自己被召唤去保护所有这些善良和美丽的庇护所。或者你可能从最早期的记忆中就知道，圣骑士的生活就是你的召唤，几乎就像你被派到这个世界上，在你的灵魂上印上了这个目的。",
	"As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and alignment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained.": "作为对抗邪恶势力的守护者，圣骑士很少有任何邪恶的倾向。他们中的大多数人走的是慈善和正义的道路。考虑一下你的结盟如何影响你追求神圣追求的方式，以及你在众神和凡人面前的行为方式。你的誓言和排列组合可能是和谐的，或者你的誓言可能代表你尚未达到的行为标准。",
	"The true worth of a paladin is measured not in foes defeated or dungeons plundered. It is measured in lives saved and hearts turned to the causes of mercy and justice.": "圣骑士的真正价值不是以击败的敌人或掠夺的地牢来衡量。它是以拯救的生命和转向仁慈和正义事业的心来衡量的。",
	"A paladin is a living embodiment of an oath—a promise or a vow made manifest in the person of a holy warrior who has the skill and the determination to see the cause through to the end. Some paladins devote themselves expressly to protecting the innocent and spreading justice in the world, while others resolve to attain that goal by conquering those who stand defiant and bringing them under the rule of law.": "圣骑士是誓言的活生生的体现--一个承诺或誓言在一个拥有技能和决心将事业进行到底的神圣战士身上得到了体现。有些圣骑士明确地致力于保护无辜者并在世界范围内传播正义，而其他圣骑士则决心通过征服那些挑衅者并将他们置于法治之下来实现这一目标。",
	"Although no paladin in the world could be described as typical, a number of them are narrow-minded do-gooders who refuse to tolerate even the smallest deviation from their own outlook. Paladins who take up the adventuring life, however, rarely remain so rigid in their attitudes—if only to keep from alienating their companions.": "虽然世界上没有一个圣骑士可以被描述为典型的，但他们中的一些人是心胸狭窄的好人，甚至拒绝容忍与自己的观点有最小的偏差。然而，从事冒险生活的圣骑士很少在他们的态度上保持如此僵硬--如果只是为了避免疏远他们的同伴。",
	"You can flesh out your paladin character by using the suggestions below. It's important to keep in mind that most paladins aren't robots. They have doubts and prejudices and harbor contradictory thoughts just as any other character does. Some are compelled by an internal motivation that might sometimes be at odds with the principles of their oaths.": "你可以通过使用下面的建议来充实你的圣骑士角色。重要的是要记住，大多数圣骑士并不是机器人。他们会有怀疑和偏见，就像其他角色一样怀有矛盾的想法。有些人被一种内部动机所驱使，这种动机有时可能与他们的誓言的原则相抵触。",
	"The precepts of a paladin's oath provide purpose to the character and dictate an ultimate goal or an overall intent that the paladin abides by and advances. Aside from that, some paladins are driven by a personal goal that either complements or transcends the dictates of their oaths. Paladins who swear different oaths might have the same personal goal, differing only in how they apply that goal to their actions when upholding their oaths.": "圣骑士的誓言为角色提供了目的，并规定了一个最终目标或圣骑士遵守和推进的总体意图。除此之外，有些圣骑士受到个人目标的驱使，这些目标或者补充或者超越了他们誓言的规定。发出不同誓言的圣骑士可能有相同的个人目标，不同的只是他们在坚守誓言时如何将该目标应用于他们的行动。",
	"If your paladin character has a personal goal, it might be drawn from some life event and thus not directly tied to the oath.": "如果你的圣骑士角色有个人目标，它可能来自一些生活事件，因此与誓言没有直接联系。",
	"Peace. You fight so that future generations will not have to.": "和平。你们的战斗是为了让后代不必这样做。",
	"Revenge. Your oath is the vehicle through which you will right an ancient wrong.": "复仇。你的誓言是你将纠正一个古老的错误的工具。",
	"Duty. You will live up to what you have sworn to do, or die trying.": "责任。你要履行你的誓言，否则就得死。",
	"Leadership. You will win a great battle that bards will sing about, and in so doing, you will become an example to inspire others.": "领导力。你将赢得一场吟游诗人会歌颂的伟大战役，这样一来，你将成为激励他人的榜样。",
	"Faith. You know your path is righteous, or else the gods would not have set you upon it.": "信心。你知道你的道路是正义的，否则众神不会让你走上这条路。",
	"Glory. You will lead the world into a grand new era, one that will be branded with your name.": "荣耀。你将带领世界进入一个宏伟的新时代，一个以你的名字为标志的时代。",
	"Paladins are mindful of the influence of symbols, and many of them adopt or design an artistic device that bears a distinctive image. Your symbol exemplifies the oath you have taken and communicates that message to those around you, friend and foe alike.": "圣骑士们注意到了符号的影响，他们中的许多人都采用或设计了一个带有独特形象的艺术装置。你的符号体现了你的誓言，并将这一信息传达给你周围的人，无论是朋友还是敌人。",
	"Your symbol might be displayed on a banner, a flag, or your clothing for all to see. Or it could be less obvious, such as a trinket or a token that you carry concealed on your person.": "你的标志可能显示在一个横幅、一面旗帜或你的衣服上，让所有人都看到。或者它可以不那么明显，比如说一个小饰品或一个你隐藏在身上的信物。",
	"A dragon, emblematic of your nobility in peace and your ferocity in combat": "一条龙，象征着你在和平时期的高贵和战斗中的凶猛",
	"A clenched fist, because you are always ready to fight for your beliefs": "紧握的拳头，因为你总是准备好为你的信仰而战",
	"An upraised open hand, indicating your preference for diplomacy over combat": "举起张开的手，表示你更倾向于外交而不是战斗",
	"A red heart, showing the world your commitment to justice": "一颗红心，向世界展示你对正义的承诺",
	"A black heart, signifying that emotions such as pity do not sway your dedication to your oath": "一颗黑色的心，象征着怜悯等情感不会动摇你对誓言的执着。",
	"An unblinking eye, meaning that you are ever alert to all threats against your cause": "一双不眨眼的眼睛，意味着你对所有针对你的事业的威胁始终保持警惕。",
	"Their adherence to a sacred oath demands that paladins take an active stance in carrying their beliefs into the world. This activity naturally leads to conflict with creatures or entities that oppose those beliefs. Among those opponents, one often stands out as a paladin's most persistent or most formidable foe—a nemesis whose presence or influence is a constant factor in a paladin's life.": "他们对神圣誓言的坚持要求圣骑士在将他们的信仰带入世界时采取积极的立场。这种活动自然会导致与反对这些信仰的生物或实体的冲突。在这些对手中，有一个人往往是圣骑士最顽固或最可怕的敌人--一个克星，他的存在或影响是圣骑士生活中的一个持续因素。",
	"Your paladin character might have an enemy that dates from the days before you took up your path. Or you could be a target because when you became a paladin, you immediately attracted the attention of those that would do you in. If you have a nemesis, who or what is it? Whom among your enemies do you consider to be the biggest threat to achieving your goals?": "你的圣骑士角色可能有一个可以追溯到你走上你的道路之前的敌人。或者你可能是一个目标，因为当你成为一名圣骑士时，你立即吸引了那些会对你下手的人的注意。如果你有一个克星，它是谁或什么？在你的敌人中，你认为谁是实现你目标的最大威胁？",

	"A vampire who has sworn revenge against all paladins after being defeated by one": "一个被圣骑士击败后发誓要向所有圣骑士复仇的吸血鬼",
	"Although paladins are dedicated to their oaths, they are mortals, and thus they are flawed. Many of them exhibit a type of behavior or hold to an attitude that is not in keeping with the highest ideals of their calling.": "虽然圣骑士们致力于他们的誓言，但他们也是凡人，因此他们也有缺陷。他们中的许多人表现出一种行为，或坚持一种态度，与他们的使命的最高理想不一致。",
