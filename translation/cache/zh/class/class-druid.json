	"Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.": "一个精灵高举着缠绕着冬青的虬枝法杖，召唤出暴风雨的怒火，召唤出爆炸性的闪电，击打威胁她的森林的持火把的兽人。",
	"Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists' activities.": "一个人类以豹子的形态蹲在高高的树枝上，从丛林中窥视着邪恶元素空气神庙的奇怪建筑，密切关注着邪教分子的活动。",
	"Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.": "一个半精灵挥舞着由纯火形成的刀刃，冲向一大群骷髅兵，粉碎了赋予这些肮脏的生物以嘲弄的生命外观的非自然魔法。",
	"Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.": "无论是召唤自然界的元素力量还是模仿动物世界的生物，德鲁伊都是自然界的韧性、狡猾和愤怒的化身。他们并不声称自己掌握了自然。相反，他们认为自己是自然界不屈不挠的意志的延伸。",
	"Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.": "德鲁伊最崇尚自然，他们的法术和其他魔法力量要么来自自然的力量本身，要么来自自然神灵。许多德鲁伊人追求的是一种与自然超然结合的神秘灵性，而不是对一个神圣实体的奉献，而其他人则是为野生自然、动物或元素力量的神明服务。古老的德鲁伊传统有时被称为古老的信仰，与寺庙和神龛中的神灵崇拜形成对比。",
	"Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.": "德鲁伊的法术以自然和动物为导向--牙齿和爪子的力量，太阳和月亮的力量，火和风暴的力量。德鲁伊也获得了化身为动物的能力，一些德鲁伊对这种做法进行了特别的研究，甚至到了喜欢动物形态而不是自然形态的程度。",
	"For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.": "对德鲁伊来说，自然界存在着一种不稳定的平衡。构成世界的四种元素--空气、土、火和水--必须保持平衡。如果一个元素获得了超越其他元素的力量，世界就会被摧毁，被卷入其中一个元素界，并被分解成其组成元素。因此，德鲁伊反对元素邪恶的邪教和其他提倡一种元素而排斥其他元素的人。",
	"Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.": "德鲁伊还关注维持植物和动物生命的微妙的生态平衡，以及文明人与自然和谐相处的需要，而不是与之对抗。德鲁伊接受自然界中残酷的东西，他们憎恨非自然的东西，包括反常者（如beholders和mind flayers）和亡灵（如僵尸和吸血鬼）。德鲁伊有时会带领突击队对付这种生物，特别是当这些怪物侵占德鲁伊的领地时。",
	"Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.": "德鲁伊经常被发现守卫圣地或看守未受破坏的自然区域。但当出现重大危险，威胁到自然界的平衡或他们所保护的土地时，德鲁伊就会作为冒险者，在打击威胁方面发挥更积极的作用。",
	"When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny.": "在制作德鲁伊时，要考虑为什么你的角色与自然有如此密切的联系。也许你的角色生活在一个旧信仰仍然兴盛的社会，或者在被遗弃在森林深处后被德鲁伊抚养长大。也许你的角色曾与自然之灵有过戏剧性的接触，与巨鹰或恶狼面对面，并在经历中幸存下来。也许你的角色出生在一场史诗般的风暴或火山爆发期间，这被解释为成为德鲁伊是你角色命运的一部分的标志。",
	"Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.": "你一直都是冒险家，这是你德鲁伊召唤的一部分，还是你最初是作为神圣丛林或泉水的看守人？也许你的家乡被邪恶所玷污，你开始了冒险生活，希望找到一个新的家园或目标。",
	"A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.": "德鲁伊认为某些植物是神圣的，特别是桤木、白蜡、桦树、接骨木、榛子、冬青、杜松、槲寄生、橡树、花楸、柳树和紫杉。德鲁伊经常使用这类植物作为施法重点的一部分，将橡木或紫杉的长度或槲寄生的枝条纳入其中。",
	"Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.": "同样，德鲁伊用这种木材来制作其他物品，如武器和盾牌。紫杉与死亡和重生有关，所以弯刀或镰刀的武器把手可能是用它制作的。灰木与生命有关，橡木与力量有关。这些木材可以制作出色的手杖或整个武器，如棍棒或四分法杖，以及盾牌。桤木与空气有关，它可以用来制作投掷武器，如飞镖或标枪。",
	"Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.": "来自缺乏这里描述的植物的地区的德鲁伊选择其他植物来承担类似的用途。例如，沙漠地区的德鲁伊可能重视丝兰树和仙人掌植物。",
	"Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.": "有些德鲁伊崇敬自然力量本身，但大多数德鲁伊都献身于多元宇宙中所崇拜的众多自然神灵之一（附录B中的神灵名单包括许多此类神灵）。对这些神灵的崇拜通常被认为是比神职人员和城市化人群的信仰更古老的传统。事实上，在灰鹰世界中，德鲁伊信仰被称为 \"古老的信仰\"，它在农民、林务员、渔民和其他与自然密切相处的人中拥有许多信徒。这一传统包括对自然的崇拜，将其作为一种超越人格化的原始力量，但也包括对奥尔特之母Beory的崇拜，以及对Obad-Hai、Ehlonna和Ulaa的奉献者。",
	"In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration.": "在灰鹰和被遗忘的领域的世界中，德鲁伊圈子通常并不与单一自然神的信仰相关。例如，在被遗忘的领域中，任何一个特定的圈子都可能包括崇尚希尔瓦娜斯、米利基、艾尔达斯、Chauntea的德鲁伊，甚至是严酷的愤怒之神：塔洛斯、马拉尔、奥里尔和翁贝利。这些自然之神通常被称为第一圈，即德鲁伊中的第一圈，大多数德鲁伊都把他们（甚至是暴力之神）视为值得崇敬的对象。",
	"The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon—sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command these spirits. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations.": "Eberron的德鲁伊持有万物有灵的信仰，与主宰者、黑暗六神或世界上任何其他宗教都没有关系。他们相信每个生物和每个自然现象--太阳、月亮、风、火和世界本身--都有一个灵魂。那么，他们的法术就是一种与这些精神沟通和指挥的手段。不过，不同的德鲁伊教派对这些精神之间以及与文明力量之间的正确关系持有不同的哲学观点。例如，\"灰界\"（Ashbound）认为奥术是对自然的憎恶，\"冬之子\"（Children of Winter）崇尚死亡的力量，而 \"守门人\"（Gatekeepers）则保留了古老的传统，旨在保护世界免受反常者的侵扰。",
	"Even in death, each creature plays its part in maintaining the Great Balance. But now an imbalance grows, a force that seeks to hold sway over nature. This is the destructive behavior of the mortal races. The farther away from nature their actions take them, the more corrupting their influence becomes. As druids, we seek mainly to protect and educate, to preserve the Great Balance, but there are times when we must rise up against danger and eradicate it.": "即使在死亡中，每个生物都在维持大平衡中发挥自己的作用。但现在，一种不平衡在增长，一种试图控制自然的力量在增长。这就是凡人种族的破坏性行为。他们的行为离自然越远，他们的影响就越腐败。作为德鲁伊，我们主要寻求保护和教育，以维护大平衡，但有时我们必须奋起反抗危险，消灭它。",
	"Druids are the caretakers of the natural world, and it is said that in time a druid becomes the voice of nature, speaking the truth that is too subtle for the general populace to hear. Many who become druids find that they naturally gravitate toward nature; its forces, cycles, and movements fill their minds and spirits with wonder and insight. Many sages and wise folk have studied nature, writing volumes about its mystery and power, but druids are a special kind of being: at some point, they begin to embody these natural forces, producing magical phenomena that link them to the spirit of nature and the flow of life. Because of their strange and mysterious power, druids are often revered, shunned, or considered dangerous by the people around them.": "德鲁伊是自然界的守护者，据说随着时间的推移，德鲁伊会成为自然的声音，说出一般人听不到的微妙真相。许多成为德鲁伊的人发现，他们自然而然地倾向于自然；自然的力量、周期和运动使他们的思想和精神充满了好奇和洞察力。许多圣人和智者都研究过自然，写了很多关于其神秘和力量的文章，但德鲁伊是一种特殊的存在：在某些时候，他们开始体现这些自然力量，产生神奇的现象，将他们与自然的精神和生命的流动联系起来。由于他们奇怪而神秘的力量，德鲁伊常常被周围的人敬重、回避或认为是危险的。",
	"Your druid character might be a true worshiper of nature, one who has always scorned civilization and found solace in the wild. Or your character could be a child of the city who now strives to bring the civilized world into harmony with the wilderness. You can use the sections that follow to flesh out your druid, regardless of how your character came to the profession.": "你的德鲁伊角色可能是一个真正的自然崇拜者，一个一直蔑视文明并在野外找到安慰的人。或者你的角色可能是一个城市的孩子，现在努力使文明世界与荒野和谐。你可以使用下面的章节来充实你的德鲁伊，无论你的角色是如何来到这个职业的。",
	"Some druids carry one or more items that are sacred to them or have deep personal significance. Such items are not necessarily magical, but every one is an object whose meaning connects the druid's mind and heart to a profound concept or spiritual outlook.": "有些德鲁伊会携带一件或多件对他们来说是神圣的或具有深刻个人意义的物品。这样的物品不一定有魔力，但每一件都是一件物品，其意义将德鲁伊的思想和心灵与一个深刻的概念或精神面貌联系在一起。",
	"When you decide what your character's treasured item is, think about giving it an origin story: how did you come by the item, and why is it important to you?": "当你决定你的角色的珍贵物品是什么时，考虑给它一个起源故事：你是如何得到这个物品的，以及它为什么对你很重要？",

	"A rattle made from a dried gourd and holly berries": "用干葫芦和冬青果做的拨浪鼓",
	"A miniature golden sickle handed down to you by your mentor": "你的导师传给你的一把微型金镰刀",
	"Many druids feel a strong link to a specific aspect of the natural world, such as a body of water, an animal, a type of tree, or some other sort of plant. You identify with your chosen aspect; by its behavior or its very nature, it sets an example that you seek to emulate.": "许多德鲁伊感到与自然界的一个特定方面有很强的联系，比如一个水体、一种动物、一种树木或其他一些植物。你认同你所选择的方面；通过它的行为或它的本质，它树立了一个你试图效仿的榜样。",
	"Yew trees remind you of renewing your mind and spirit, letting the old die and the new spring forth.": "紫杉树提醒你更新你的思想和精神，让旧的死去，新的涌现。",
	"Oak trees represent strength and vitality. Meditating under an oak fills your body and mind with resolve and fortitude.": "橡树代表力量和活力。在橡树下冥想能使你的身体和心灵充满决心和毅力。",

	"It's not unusual for would-be druids to seek out (or be sought out by) instructors or elders who teach them the basics of their magical arts. Most druids who learn from a mentor begin their training at a young age, and the mentor has a vital role in shaping a student's attitudes and beliefs.": "对于未来的德鲁伊来说，寻找（或被寻找）教官或长老教他们魔法艺术的基础知识是很平常的。大多数向导师学习的德鲁伊在年轻时就开始训练，导师在塑造学生的态度和信仰方面具有重要作用。",
	"If your character received training from someone else, who or what was that individual, and what was the nature of your relationship? Did your mentor imbue you with a particular outlook or otherwise influence your approach to achieving the goals of your chosen path?": "如果你的角色接受了别人的训练，那么这个人是谁或什么，你们之间的关系是什么性质的？你的导师是否给你灌输了特定的观点，或以其他方式影响你实现所选道路目标的方法？",
	"Your mentor was a wise treant who taught you to think in terms of years and decades rather than days or months.": "你的导师是一位聪明的树人，他教你以年和十年为单位思考问题，而不是以天或月为单位。",
	"You were tutored by a dryad who watched over a slumbering portal to the Abyss. During your training, you were tasked with watching for hidden threats to the world.": "你被一个守护着沉睡的深渊入口的干尸所教导。在你的训练中，你的任务是观察对世界的隐藏威胁。",

	"The Wild Shape feature in the player's handbook lets you transform into a beast that you've seen.

	"When you gain Wild Shape as a 2nd-level druid, you might wonder which beasts you've already seen. The following tables organize beasts from the monster manual according to the beasts' most likely environments.
