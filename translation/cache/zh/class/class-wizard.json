	"Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.": "一个精灵身着代表她地位的银色长袍，闭上眼睛，将战场上的杂念拒之门外，开始她安静的吟唱。她的手指在身前穿梭，完成了她的咒语，并向敌人的队伍发射了一颗小小的火珠，在那里爆发出一场吞噬士兵的大火。",
	"Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.": "一个人在检查和再检查他的工作，用粉笔在光秃秃的石板上划出一个复杂的魔法圈，然后沿着每条线和优美的曲线撒上铁粉。当圆圈完成后，他口中念着长长的咒语。圆圈内的空间打开了一个洞，从另一个世界的空间带来一缕硫磺的味道。",
	"Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.": "蹲在地牢路口的地板上，一个地精扔了一把刻有神秘符号的小骨头，对着它们嘀咕了几句有力量的话。他闭上眼睛，想更清楚地看到那些幻象，他慢慢地点点头，然后睁开眼睛，指向左边的通道。",
	"Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.": "巫师是至高无上的魔法使用者，通过他们所施展的法术来定义和凝聚成一个类别。利用渗透在宇宙中的微妙的魔法编织，巫师们施展出爆炸性的火焰、弧形的闪电、微妙的欺骗以及粗暴的精神控制等法术。他们的魔法从其他存在的星球上召唤出怪物，瞥见未来，或将被杀的敌人变成僵尸。他们最强大的法术将一种物质变成另一种物质，将流星从天空中召唤下来，或打开通往其他世界的门户。",
	"Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.": "魔法的力量狂野而神秘，形式和功能各不相同，吸引着那些寻求掌握其奥秘的学生。有些人渴望成为像神一样的人，塑造现实本身。虽然施展一个典型的法术只需要说出几个奇怪的词，转瞬即逝的手势，有时还需要捏起或粘上异国的材料，但这些表面的成分几乎没有暗示经过多年的学徒生涯和无数个小时的学习而获得的专业知识。",
	"Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.": "巫师靠他们的法术生存和死亡。其他都是次要的。他们随着实验和经验的增长学习新的法术。他们也可以从其他巫师、古籍或铭文，以及沉浸在魔法中的古老生物（如精灵）那里学习。",
	"Wizards' lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.": "巫师的生活很少是平凡的。巫师最接近普通人的生活是在图书馆或大学里当圣人或讲师，教别人多元宇宙的秘密。其他巫师作为占卜者出售他们的服务，在军队中服务，或追求犯罪或统治的生活。",
	"But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.": "但是，知识和力量的诱惑，即使是最没有冒险精神的巫师也会走出他们安全的图书馆和实验室，进入破败的废墟和失落的城市。大多数巫师相信，他们在古代文明中的同行知道已被时代遗忘的魔法秘密，而发现这些秘密可以开启通向比现今时代的任何魔法都要强大的道路。",

	"Your wizard character's most prized possession—your spellbook—might be an innocuous-looking volume whose covers show no hint of what's inside. Or you might display some flair, as many wizards do, by carrying a spellbook of an unusual sort. If you don't own such an item already, one of your goals might be to find a spellbook that sets you apart by its appearance or its means of manufacture.": "你的巫师角色最珍贵的财产--你的法术书--可能是一本看起来无足轻重的书，其封面没有暗示里面有什么。或者你可以像许多巫师一样，通过携带一本不寻常的法术书来显示一些天赋。如果你还没有这样的物品，你的目标之一可能是找到一本因其外观或制造方法而使你与众不同的法术书。",

	"Few aspiring wizards undertake the study of magic without some personal goal in mind. Many wizards use their spells as a tool to produce a tangible benefit, in material goods or in status, for themselves or their companions. For others, the theoretical aspect of magic might have a strong appeal, pushing those wizards to seek out knowledge that supports new theories of the arcane or confirms old ones.": "很少有有抱负的巫师在研究魔法时不考虑一些个人目标。许多巫师把他们的法术作为一种工具，为他们自己或他们的同伴产生有形的利益，在物质产品或地位上。对其他人来说，魔法的理论方面可能有很强的吸引力，促使这些巫师去寻找支持新的奥术理论或证实旧理论的知识。",

You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.": "你可以从自己的法术书中复制一个法术到另一本法术书中--例如，如果你想为你的法术书做一个备份。这就像把一个新的咒语复制到你的法术书中一样，但是更快、更容易，因为你了解自己的符号，并且已经知道如何施法。你只需要花1个小时和10个金币来完成每一级的复制法术。",

It looks like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a scholar from the past (your choice).": "你可以召唤出你觉醒的魔法书的思想。当书在你身上时，作为一个额外的动作，你可以使心灵显现为一个微小的幽灵物体，盘旋在你周围60英尺内你选择的一个无人的空间。幽灵之心是无形的，不占据它的空间，它在10英尺的范围内发出昏暗的光。它看起来像一本幽灵般的书，一串文字，或者一个来自过去的学者（你选择）。",
	"Whenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind's space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.": "每当你在自己的回合中施展巫师法术时，你可以像在幽灵之心的空间中一样施展它，而不是你自己的空间，使用它的感官。你每天可以这样做的次数与你的熟练度加成相等，当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你会恢复所有消耗的用法。",
	"As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects.": "作为一个额外的行动，你可以使幽灵之心盘旋到你或它能看到的一个未被占用的空间，最远可达30英尺。它可以穿过生物，但不能穿过物体。",
	"Once you conjure the mind, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to conjure it again.": "一旦你召唤出心灵，你就不能再这样做，直到你完成一个长时间的休息，除非你消耗一个任何级别的法术槽来再次召唤它。",
	"Whenever you finish a long rest, you can create one magic scroll by touching your Wizardly Quill to a blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one spell from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied onto the scroll. The spellbook must be within 5 feet of you when you make the scroll.": "每当你完成一个长时间的休息，你可以通过将你的魔法笔触及一张空白的纸或羊皮纸，使你的觉醒法术书中的一个法术被复制到卷轴上，从而创造一个魔法卷轴。当你制作卷轴时，魔法书必须在你的5英尺之内。",
	"The chosen spell must be of 1st or 2nd level and must have a casting time of 1 action. Once in the scroll, the spell's power is enhanced, counting as one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell from the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell vanishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you finish your next long rest.": "所选择的法术必须是一级或二级的，并且必须有一个动作的施法时间。一旦进入卷轴，咒语的力量就会增强，算作比正常情况下高一个等级。你可以通过阅读卷轴上的咒语作为一个动作来施放。该卷轴对其他人来说是无法理解的，当你施放时或当你完成下一次长时间休息时，该咒语会从卷轴中消失。",

	"Magic of the book—that's what many spellcasters call wizardry. The name is apt, given how much time wizards spend poring over their spellbooks, penning theories about the nature of magic, and exploring the farthest recesses of libraries. It's rare to see a wizard traveling without books and scrolls sprouting from their bags, and a wizard would go to great lengths to plumb an archive of ancient knowledge.": "书中的魔法--这就是许多施法者所说的巫术。这个名字很贴切，因为巫师们花了很多时间翻阅他们的法术书，撰写关于魔法本质的理论，并探索图书馆最远的地方。很少看到一个巫师在旅行时没有从他们的包里拿出书籍和卷轴，而一个巫师会不遗余力地去挖掘古代知识的档案。",
	"When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with the damage type of another spell in your spellbook, as your spellbook magically alters the spell's formula for this casting.": "当你用法术槽施放巫师法术时，你可以暂时用你法术书中另一个法术的伤害类型来替换它的伤害类型，因为你的法术书为这次施法神奇地改变了法术的公式。",

As a bonus action while the book is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral construct, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. This presence is intangible and doesn't occupy its space, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It looks like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a scholar from the past (your choice). The spectral mind has a number of hit points equal to your wizard level plus your Intelligence modifier, and it uses your Armor Class and saving throw modifiers.": "你现在能够召唤出你的觉醒法术书的思想。当书在你身上时，作为一个额外的行动，你可以使心灵显现为一个微小的幽灵结构，盘旋在你周围60英尺内你选择的一个无人的空间。这个存在是无形的，并不占据它的空间，它在10英尺的范围内发出昏暗的光。它看起来像一本幽灵般的书，一串文字，或者一个来自过去的学者（你选择）。幽灵之心的命中率等于你的巫师等级加上你的智力修正值，它使用你的护甲等级和蓄力修正值。",
	"As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects.

	"Your connection to your Awakened Spellbook has become so profound that your soul has become entwined with it. While you are holding the book and its spectral mind is manifest, you can take an action to cause the two of you to teleport, swapping places. You can teleport in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.": "你和你的觉醒法术书的联系已经变得如此深刻，以至于你的灵魂已经和它缠绕在一起。当你拿着这本书并且它的幽灵之心显现时，你可以采取一个行动，使你们两个人进行传送，交换位置。你可以用这种方式传送的次数与你的熟练度加成相等，当你完成长时间的休息时，你会恢复所有消耗的次数。",
	"That distinction creates power that onomancers seek to tap. By speaking a target's true name, the wizard's spells slip between the cracks of the target's defenses, conforming to its essential nature through the power of its name. To protect themselves, wizards who follow this tradition often hide their true names, typically by adopting monikers and pseudonyms.": "这种区别创造了巫师们想要利用的力量。通过说出目标的真名，巫师的法术从目标防御的缝隙中溜走，通过其名字的力量符合其本质属性。为了保护自己，遵循这一传统的巫师通常会隐藏自己的真名，通常采用单名和假名。",

	"Onomancy, or naming magic, is a method of spellcasting that uses a creature's true name to enhance a spell's effects. A true name is the name by which a self-aware creature identifies itself. This name might be the name a person was given at birth, or one a person chose or earned later in life. Whatever a name's origin, the simplest way for you to know your true name is to think truthfully about yourself and then think, \"My name is...\" Your true name is how you finish that sentence.": "命名魔法，是一种使用生物的真实名字来增强法术效果的施法方法。真名是一个有自我意识的生物用来识别自己的名字。这个名字可能是一个人出生时被赋予的名字，也可能是一个人在生活中选择或赢得的名字。不管名字的来源是什么，你要知道自己的真名，最简单的方法是如实地思考自己，然后想：\"我的名字是......\"。你的真名就是你如何完成这句话。",
	"You can try to hide your true name by using a pseudonym, but you must be wary not to inhabit that false name too deeply. If a false name comes to be the best expression of who you are, it becomes your true name. Changing one's true name is never a quick choice; it's something that happens over time as a name becomes the creature's truth.": "你可以尝试通过使用假名来隐藏你的真名，但你必须警惕，不要把这个假名居住得太深。如果一个假名成为你的最佳表达方式，它就成为你的真名。改变一个人的真名从来不是一个快速的选择；它是随着时间的推移而发生的事情，因为一个名字成为生物的真相。",

	"You can use one Resonant when you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot and speak the true name of one creature targeted by the spell. Speaking the name is part of casting the spell. You can use Resonants a number of times equal to half of your wizard level (round down), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.": "当你用一个法术槽施展巫师法术时，你可以使用一个共鸣，并说出法术所针对的一个生物的真实名字。说出这个名字是施法的一部分。你可以使用的共鸣次数等于你的巫师等级的一半（四舍五入），并且当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你会恢复所有已消耗的使用。",

	"Starting at 2nd level, you can produce magic potions. You spend 10 minutes focusing your magic on a vial of mundane water and expend a spell slot to transform it into a potion. Once you have expended a spell slot to create a potion, you cannot regain that slot until the potion is consumed or after 1 week, at which time the potion loses its effectiveness. You can create up to three potions at a time; creating a fourth potion causes the oldest currently active one to immediately lose its potency. If that potion has been consumed, its effects immediately end.": "从2级开始，你可以制造魔法药水。你花10分钟将你的魔力集中在一小瓶普通的水上，并消耗一个法术槽将其转化为一种药水。一旦你消耗了一个法术槽来制造一种药水，你就不能再获得那个法术槽，直到药水被消耗掉或在1周后，那时药水就会失去效力。你一次最多可以创造三个药水；创造第四个药水会使目前最老的那个药水立即失去效力。如果该药水已被消耗，其效果也会立即结束。",
