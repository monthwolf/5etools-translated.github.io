	"Unlimited": "无限制",
	"A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people's elk herd.": "一个高大的人类部落成员穿过暴风雪，披着毛皮，举着斧头，大步走来。他大笑着冲向那个胆敢偷猎他的人民的麋鹿群的冰霜巨人。",
	"A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.": "一个半兽人对她在野蛮部落的权威的最新挑战者咆哮，准备用她的手拧断他的脖子，就像她对前六个对手做的那样。",
	"Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.": "一个矮人口吐白沫，用头盔砸向他的乌鸦敌人的脸，然后转身用他的装甲肘部撞向另一个人的内脏。",
	"For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.": "对一些人来说，他们的愤怒来自与凶猛的动物精神的交流。另一些人的愤怒则来自于对这个充满痛苦的世界的愤怒水库。对于每一个野蛮人来说，愤怒是一种力量，它不仅能激发战斗的狂热，还能激发出不可思议的反应能力、复原力和力量。",
	"Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.": "野蛮人在混乱的战斗中变得活跃起来。他们可以进入狂暴状态，愤怒占据了他们的身体，赋予他们超人的力量和韧性。野蛮人只能在不休息的情况下利用这个愤怒的水库，但这几次的愤怒通常足以打败任何出现的威胁。",
	"Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.": "他们面对危险的勇气使野蛮人完全适合于冒险。漂泊往往是他们本土部落的一种生活方式，而冒险者的无根生活对野蛮人来说并不困难。一些野蛮人怀念部落中紧密的家庭结构，但最终发现它们被冒险队成员之间形成的联系所取代。",
	"When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?": "在创建野蛮人角色时，考虑你的角色来自哪里以及他或她在这个世界上的位置。与你的管理员讨论一下你的野蛮人的适当起源。你是否来自遥远的地方，使你在战役的地区成为一个陌生人？或者，活动的背景是在一个野蛮的边境地区，野蛮人很常见？",
	"What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to \"civilized\" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.": "是什么导致你开始了冒险生活？你是被财富的承诺吸引到定居地的吗？你是否与这些土地上的士兵联合起来，共同面对威胁？是怪物或入侵的部落把你赶出了你的家园，使你成为无根的难民？也许你是个战俘，被锁在 \"文明 \"的土地上，现在才得以赢得自由。或者你可能因为犯了罪，违反了禁忌，或者因为一场政变把你从权力的位置上赶走，而被从你的人民中赶走。",
	"I have witnessed the indomitable performance of barbarians on the field of battle, and it makes me wonder what force lies at the heart of their rage.": "我目睹了野蛮人在战场上不屈不挠的表现，这让我想知道他们愤怒的核心是什么力量。",
	"The anger felt by a normal person resembles the rage of a barbarian in the same way that a gentle breeze is akin to a furious thunderstorm. The barbarian's driving force comes from a place that transcends mere emotion, making its manifestation all the more terrible. Whether the impetus for the fury comes entirely from within or from forging a link with a spirit animal, a raging barbarian becomes able to perform supernatural feats of strength and endurance. The outburst is temporary, but while it lasts, it takes over body and mind, driving the barbarian on despite peril and injury, until the last enemy falls.": "一个正常人的愤怒与野蛮人的愤怒相似，就像温柔的微风与狂暴的雷雨相似一样。野蛮人的动力来自一个超越单纯情感的地方，使其表现得更加可怕。无论愤怒的动力完全来自内心，还是来自与灵兽的联系，狂暴的野蛮人都能完成超自然的力量和耐力的表演。这种爆发是暂时的，但在它持续的时候，它占据了身体和心灵，促使野蛮人不顾危险和伤害继续前进，直到最后一个敌人倒下。",
	"It can be tempting to play a barbarian character that is a straightforward application of the classic archetype—a brute, and usually a dimwitted one at that, who rushes in where others fear to tread. But not all the barbarians in the world are cut from that cloth, so you can certainly put your own spin on things. Either way, consider adding some flourishes to make your barbarian stand out from all others; see the following sections for some ideas.": "扮演一个野蛮人的角色是很诱人的，它是对经典原型的直接应用--一个野蛮人，而且通常是一个愚蠢的野蛮人，他冲到别人害怕的地方去踩踏。但并不是世界上所有的野蛮人都是这样的，所以你当然可以把你自己的东西放在上面。无论如何，考虑添加一些装饰，使你的野蛮人从所有其他人中脱颖而出；请看以下章节的一些想法。",
	"Barbarians tend to travel light, carrying little in the way of personal effects or other unnecessary gear. The few possessions they do carry often include small items that have special significance. A personal totem is significant because it has a mystical origin or is tied to an important moment in the character's life—perhaps a remembrance from the barbarian's past or a harbinger of what lies ahead.": "野蛮人倾向于轻装上阵，很少携带个人物品或其他不必要的装备。他们所携带的少数财产往往包括具有特殊意义的小物品。个人图腾的意义在于它有一个神秘的起源，或者与人物生活中的一个重要时刻有关--也许是野蛮人过去的回忆，或者是未来的预兆。",
	"A personal totem of this sort might be associated with a barbarian's spirit animal, or might actually be the totem object for the animal, but such a connection is not essential. One who has a bear totem spirit, for instance, could still carry an eagle's feather as a personal totem.": "这种个人图腾可能与野蛮人的精神动物有关，也可能实际上是该动物的图腾物，但这种联系并不重要。例如，一个拥有熊图腾精神的人，仍然可以携带鹰的羽毛作为个人图腾。",
	"Consider creating one or more personal totems for your character—objects that hold a special link to your character's past or future. Think about how a totem might affect your character's actions.": "考虑为你的角色创造一个或多个个人图腾--与你的角色的过去或未来有特殊联系的物品。想一想图腾会如何影响你的角色的行动。",

	"The members of many barbarian clans decorate their bodies with tattoos, each of which represents a significant moment in the life of the bearer or the bearer's ancestors, or which symbolizes a feeling or an attitude. As with personal totems, a barbarian's tattoos might or might not be related to an animal spirit.": "许多野蛮人部族的成员用纹身来装饰自己的身体，每一个纹身都代表着持有者或持有者的祖先生活中的一个重要时刻，或者象征着一种感觉或态度。与个人图腾一样，野蛮人的纹身可能与动物精神有关，也可能无关。",
	"Each tattoo a barbarian displays contributes to that individual's identity. If your character wears tattoos, what do they look like, and what do they represent?": "野蛮人展示的每一个纹身都有助于这个人的身份。如果你的角色有纹身，它们是什么样子的，它们代表什么？",

	"The eyes of a wolf are marked on your back to help you see and ward off evil spirits.": "狼的眼睛被标在你的背上，以帮助你看清和驱除邪灵。",
	"Barbarians vary widely in how they understand life. Some follow gods and look for guidance from those deities in the cycles of nature and the animals they encounter. These barbarians believe that spirits inhabit the plants and animals of the world, and the barbarians look to them for omens and power.": "野蛮人对生命的理解差异很大。有些人追随神灵，并从自然界的循环和他们遇到的动物中寻找这些神灵的指引。这些野蛮人相信，精神居住在世界的植物和动物中，野蛮人向他们寻找预兆和力量。",
	"Other barbarians trust only in the blood that runs in their veins and the steel they hold in their hands. They have no use for the invisible world, instead relying on their senses to hunt and survive like the wild beasts they emulate.": "其他野蛮人只相信他们血管中流淌的血液和他们手中的钢铁。他们对看不见的世界没有用处，而是像他们模仿的野兽一样，依靠感官来狩猎和生存。",
	"Both of these attitudes can give rise to superstitions. These beliefs are often passed down within a family or shared among the members of a clan or a hunting group.": "这两种态度都会引起迷信。这些信仰往往在一个家庭中流传，或者在一个部族或一个狩猎团体的成员之间分享。",
	"If your barbarian character has any superstitions, were they ingrained in you by your family, or are they the result of personal experience?": "如果你的野蛮人角色有任何迷信，它们是由你的家人根深蒂固的，还是个人经历的结果？",

	"Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.": "从第二级开始，你可以抛开所有对防御的关注，以凶猛的拼命方式进行攻击。当你在你的回合中进行第一次攻击时，你可以决定不顾一切地攻击。这样做会使你在本回合使用力量的近战武器攻击卷轴上获得优势，但对你的攻击卷轴有优势，直到你下一回合。",
