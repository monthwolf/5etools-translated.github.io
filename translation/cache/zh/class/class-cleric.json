	"Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.": "手臂和眼睛朝向太阳，嘴里祈祷着，一个精灵开始闪烁着内在的光芒，溢出来治愈他那些饱经战火的同伴们。",
	"Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe's fall.": "一个矮人吟唱着荣耀之歌，挥舞着他的斧头，大刀阔斧地砍杀着与他对峙的兽人队伍，在每一个敌人倒下的时候，他都高声赞美诸神。",
	"Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.": "在对不死的力量发出诅咒的同时，一个人类举起了她的神圣符号，从它身上涌出的光芒驱赶着挤向她同伴的僵尸。",
	"Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.": "牧师是凡人世界和遥远的诸神世界之间的中介。和他们所服务的神一样，教士们努力体现他们神的手艺。不是普通的牧师，教士被赋予了神圣的魔法。",
	"Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.": "神圣的魔法，顾名思义，是诸神的力量，从他们那里流向世界。神职人员是这种力量的管道，将其表现为神奇的效果。诸神并不把这种力量授予每一个寻求它的人，而只授予那些被选中来完成高尚使命的人。",
	"Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.": "驾驭神圣的魔法并不依赖于学习或训练。牧师可能会学习公式化的祈祷和古老的仪式，但施展牧师法术的能力依赖于虔诚和对神灵愿望的直觉。",
	"Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.": "牧师将治疗和激励盟友的有用魔法与伤害和阻碍敌人的法术相结合。他们可以引起敬畏和恐惧，施加瘟疫或毒药的诅咒，甚至从天上召唤火焰来吞噬他们的敌人。对于那些最能从一记重击中获益的恶人，牧师们依靠他们的战斗训练，让他们在近战中发挥神的力量。",
	"Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.": "并非每个神庙或神社的圣徒或司仪都是神职人员。一些牧师被要求过着简单的寺庙服务生活，通过祈祷和祭祀，而不是通过魔法和武器的力量来执行他们的神的意志。在一些城市，神职相当于一种政治职务，被视为通往更高权力职位的垫脚石，根本不涉及与神的交流。真正的神职人员在大多数等级制度中都是罕见的。",
	"When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.": "当一个牧师开始冒险生活时，通常是因为他或她的神要求这样做。追求神灵的目标往往涉及到勇敢面对文明之墙以外的危险，打击邪恶或在古墓中寻找神圣的遗迹。许多神职人员还被要求保护他们的神的崇拜者，这可能意味着与猖獗的兽人作战，在交战的国家之间进行和平谈判，或者封印一个允许恶魔王子进入世界的门户。",
	"Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.": "大多数冒险的神职人员都与他们信仰的既定神庙和教团保持着某种联系。寺庙可能会请求牧师的帮助，或者大祭司可能会要求牧师提供帮助。",
	"To become a cleric is to become a messenger of the gods. The power the divine offers is great, but it always comes with tremendous responsibility.": "成为教士就是成为众神的信使。神灵提供的力量是伟大的，但它总是伴随着巨大的责任。",
	"Almost all the folk in the world who revere a deity live their lives without ever being directly touched by a divine being. As such, they can never know what it feels like to be a cleric—someone who is not only a devout worshiper, but who has also been invested with a measure of a deity's power.": "世界上几乎所有崇尚神灵的人在生活中都没有被神灵直接接触过。因此，他们永远无法体会到成为神职人员的感觉--一个不仅是虔诚的崇拜者，而且还被赋予一定程度的神力的人。",
	"If you're playing a cleric character, the following sections offer ways to add some detail to that character's history and personality.": "如果你扮演的是一个牧师角色，下面的章节提供了为该角色的历史和个性增加一些细节的方法。",
	"Most clerics start their lives of service as priests in an order, then later realize that they have been blessed by their god with the qualities needed to become a cleric. To prepare for this new duty, candidates typically receive instruction from a cleric of a temple or another place of study devoted to their deity.": "大多数神职人员开始他们的服务生活时是作为一个教团的牧师，后来意识到他们已经得到了他们的神的祝福，具备了成为神职人员所需的素质。为了准备这一新的职责，候选人通常会接受神庙或其他专门研究其神灵的地方的教士的指导。",
	"Some temples are cut off from the world so that their occupants can focus on devotions, while other temples open their doors to minister to and heal the masses. What is noteworthy about the temple you studied at?": "有些寺庙与世隔绝，以便其居住者能够专注于奉献，而其他寺庙则敞开大门，为大众提供服务和治疗。你所学习的寺庙有什么值得注意的地方？",
	"Your temple is said to be the oldest surviving structure built to honor your god.": "你的寺庙据说是现存最古老的建筑，为纪念你的神而建。",
	"Acolytes of several like-minded deities all received instruction together in your temple.": "几个志同道合的神灵的信徒都在你的寺庙里一起接受指导。",

	"Your temple is a peaceful, humble place, filled with vegetable gardens and simple priests.": "你的寺庙是一个和平、谦逊的地方，充满了菜园和简单的祭司。",
	"You served in a temple in the Outer Planes.": "你在外星球的一个神庙中服务。",
	"Many clerics have items among their personal gear that symbolize their faith, remind them of their vows, or otherwise help to keep them on their chosen paths. Even though such an item is not imbued with divine power, it is vitally important to its owner because of what it represents.": "许多神职人员的个人装备中都有象征他们信仰的物品，提醒他们的誓言，或以其他方式帮助他们保持他们所选择的道路。即使这样的物品没有被赋予神圣的力量，但由于它所代表的内容，对它的主人来说是至关重要的。",

	"If you haven't considered this aspect of your character yet, see the table entries for some possibilities, or use them for inspiration. Your deep, dark secret might involve something you did (or are doing), or it could be rooted in the way you feel about the world and your role in it.": "如果你还没有考虑过你角色的这一方面，请看表格中的条目，了解一些可能性，或者用它们来激发灵感。你内心深处的秘密可能涉及你所做的（或正在做的）事情，也可能植根于你对这个世界和你在其中的角色的感受。",
	"An imp offers you counsel. You try to ignore the creature, but sometimes its advice is helpful.": "一个小恶魔向你提供建议。你试图忽略这个生物，但有时它的建议是有帮助的。",

The cleric's magic flows from the god or the god's sacred realm, and often the cleric bears a holy symbol that represents that divinity.": "典型的教士是某一特定神明的仆人，并选择与该神明相关的神域。教士的魔法来自于该神或该神的神圣领域，而且教士往往带有代表该神性的神圣符号。",
	"The cleric's class features often refer to your deity. If you are devoted to a pantheon, cosmic force, or philosophy, your cleric features still work for you as written. Think of the references to a god as references to the divine thing you serve that gives you your magic.": "牧师的类别特征通常指的是你的神灵。如果你献身于一个万神殿、宇宙力量或哲学，你的牧师特征仍然按规定对你有效。把对神的提及看作是对你所服务的、赋予你魔法的神圣事物的提及。",

As an action, you can open your awareness to magically detect undead.
