{
	"Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.": "一个看起来粗野的人类独自漫步在树影中，猎杀他知道正在计划袭击附近农场的兽人。他双手紧握短剑，变成一股钢铁旋风，砍倒一个又一个敌人。",
	"After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick scales.": "在从冰冷的空气中翻滚开来后，一个精灵找到了她的脚，拉开她的弓，向白龙放箭。甩开从龙身上散发出来的恐惧浪潮，就像龙的呼吸的寒冷一样，她发出一支又一支的箭，寻找龙厚厚的鳞片之间的缝隙。",
	"Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.": "半精灵把手举得高高的，对着高空盘旋的鹰吹口哨，召唤鸟儿回到他身边。他用精灵语低声指示，指向他一直在追踪的猫头鹰，并派鹰去引开那只动物，同时他准备好他的弓。",
	"Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.": "远离城市和城镇的喧嚣，越过为最遥远的农场提供庇护的篱笆，使其免受野生动物的威胁，在无轨森林的密集树木中，以及在宽阔空旷的平原上，护林员保持着无尽的警惕。",
	"Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.": "游骑兵是荒野的勇士，他们专门猎杀威胁文明边缘的怪物--人形突袭者、横冲直撞的野兽和怪兽、可怕的巨人和致命的巨龙。他们学会了像捕食者一样追踪他们的猎物，在荒野中隐秘地移动，把自己藏在灌木和瓦砾中。游骑兵将他们的战斗训练集中在对他们所喜欢的特定敌人特别有用的技术上。",
	"Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.": "由于他们对荒野的熟悉，游骑兵获得了施展法术的能力，利用自然的力量，就像德鲁伊那样。他们的法术和他们的战斗能力一样，强调速度、隐蔽性和狩猎。游侠的天赋和能力在保护边境地区的严峻任务中得到了致命的磨练。",
	"Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.": "虽然游侠可能以猎人、向导或追踪者为生，但游侠真正的使命是保卫文明的郊区，免受从野外涌来的怪物和人形大军的蹂躏。在一些地方，游侠们聚集在秘密的秩序中，或者与德鲁伊教派的圈子联合起来。然而，许多游骑兵几乎是独立的，他们知道，当一条龙或一队兽人进攻时，游骑兵可能是第一道，也可能是最后一道防线。",
	"This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.": "这种强烈的独立性使游侠很适合冒险，因为他们已经习惯了远离干爽的床和热水澡的舒适生活。面对那些在城市长大的冒险家，他们对野外的艰难困苦喋喋不休，游侠们的反应是混合着欢笑、沮丧和同情的。但他们很快就知道，其他能够在与文明的敌人的斗争中承担自己的重量的冒险者是值得任何额外负担的。娇生惯养的城市人可能不知道如何养活自己或在野外寻找淡水，但他们在其他方面弥补了这一点。",
	"As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.": "当你创建游侠角色时，考虑赋予你特殊能力的训练的性质。你是否和一个导师一起训练，一起在荒野中游荡，直到你掌握了游侠的方法？你是否离开了你的学徒生涯，或者你的导师被杀了--也许是被成为你最喜欢的敌人的那种怪物所杀？或者你是作为隶属于德鲁伊教派的游侠队伍中的一员而学会了你的技能，在神秘的道路和荒野的传说中接受训练。你可能是自学成才，一个隐居者，通过在荒野中生存的需要，学会了战斗技巧、追踪，甚至与自然的神奇联系。",
	"What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?": "你对某类敌人的特别仇恨的来源是什么？是一个怪物杀死了你所爱的人或摧毁了你的家乡？还是你看到了太多这些怪物造成的破坏，并承诺要控制它们的掠夺行为？你的冒险生涯是你保护边疆的工作的延续，还是一个重大的改变？是什么让你加入了一个冒险者的队伍？你是觉得向新盟友传授野外生存之道是一种挑战，还是欢迎他们提供的孤独的解脱？",
	"I spend a lot of my life away from civilization, keeping to its fringes to protect it. Don't assume that because I don't bend the knee to your king that I haven't done more to protect him than all his knights put together.": "我花了很多时间远离文明，守在文明的边缘来保护它。不要以为我不向你的国王屈膝，就认为我为保护他所做的事比他所有的骑士加起来还多。",
	"Rangers are free-minded wanderers and seekers who patrol the edges of civilized territory, turning back the denizens of the wild lands beyond. It is a thankless job, since their efforts are rarely understood and almost never rewarded. Yet rangers persist in their duties, never doubting that their work makes the world a safer place.": "游骑兵是思想自由的流浪者和寻求者，他们在文明地区的边缘巡逻，将野地的居民拒之门外。这是一份不遗余力的工作，因为他们的努力很少被理解，也几乎从未得到过回报。然而，护林员坚持他们的职责，从不怀疑他们的工作使世界变得更加安全。",
	"A relationship with civilization informs every ranger's personality and history. Some rangers see themselves as enforcers of the law and bringers of justice on civilization's frontier, answering to no sovereign power. Others are survivalists who eschew civilization altogether. They vanquish monsters to keep themselves safe while they live in and travel through the perilous wild areas of the world. If their efforts also benefit the kingdoms and other civilized realms that they avoid, so be it.": "与文明的关系影响着每个游骑兵的个性和历史。有些游骑兵认为自己是法律的执行者，是文明边界上的正义使者，不听从任何主权国家的命令。其他人则是完全摒弃文明的生存主义者。他们消灭怪物以保证自己的安全，同时他们生活在世界危险的野外地区并在那里旅行。如果他们的努力也有利于他们所避免的王国和其他文明领域，那就这样吧。",
	"If you're creating or playing a ranger character, the following sections offer ideas for embellishing the character and enhancing your roleplaying experience.": "如果你正在创建或扮演一个游侠角色，下面的章节提供了美化角色和增强你的角色扮演经验的想法。",
	"A ranger's view of the world begins (and sometimes ends) with that character's outlook toward civilized folk and the places they occupy. Some rangers have an attitude toward civilization that's deeply rooted in disdain, while others pity the people they have sworn to protect—though on the battlefield, it's impossible to tell the difference between one ranger and another. Indeed, to those who have seen them operate and been the beneficiaries of their prowess, it scarcely matters why rangers do what they do. That said, no two rangers are likely to express their opinions on any matter in the same way.": "一个游骑兵对世界的看法始于（有时也终于）该角色对文明人和他们所居住的地方的看法。有些游骑兵对文明的态度是根深蒂固的蔑视，而有些游骑兵则怜悯他们发誓要保护的人--尽管在战场上，不可能分辨出一个游骑兵和另一个游骑兵的区别。事实上，对于那些见过他们行动并成为他们能力的受益者的人来说，游骑兵为什么要做他们所做的事几乎不重要。也就是说，没有两个游骑兵可能会以相同的方式表达他们对任何问题的看法。",
	"If you haven't yet thought about the details of your character's worldview, consider putting a finer point on things by summarizing that viewpoint in a short statement (such as the entries on the following table). How might that feeling affect the way you conduct yourself?": "如果你还没有考虑到你的角色的世界观的细节，可以考虑把事情做得更细，把这个观点概括在一个简短的声明中（比如下表中的条目）。这种感觉会如何影响你的行为方式？",
	"Towns and cities are the best places for those who can't survive on their own.": "城镇和城市是那些不能独立生存的人的最佳场所。",
	"The advancement of civilization is the best way to thwart chaos, but its reach must be monitored.": "文明的进步是挫败混乱的最佳途径，但其影响范围必须受到监控。",
	"Towns and cities are a necessary evil, but once the wilderness is purged of supernatural threats, we will need them no more.": "城镇和城市是一种必要的邪恶，但是一旦荒野上的超自然威胁被清除，我们就不再需要它们了。",
	"Walls are for cowards, who huddle behind them while others do the work of making the world safe.": "墙是为懦夫准备的，他们蜷缩在墙后面，而其他人却在做使世界安全的工作。",
	"Visiting a town is not unpleasant, but after a few days I feel the irresistible call to return to the wild.": "参观一个城镇并不令人不快，但几天后，我感到有一种不可抗拒的召唤，要回到野外。",
	"Cities breed weakness by isolating folk from the harsh lessons of the wild.": "城市将人们与野外的严酷教训隔离开来，从而滋生了弱点。",
	"All rangers, regardless of how they came to take up the profession, have a strong connection to the natural world and its various terrains. For some rangers, the wilderness is where they grew up, either as a result of being born there or moving there at a young age. For other rangers, civilization was originally home, but the wilderness became a second homeland.": "所有护林员，无论他们是如何从事这一职业的，都与自然界及其各种地形有着密切的联系。对于一些护林员来说，荒野是他们成长的地方，要么是出生在那里，要么是在年轻的时候搬到那里。对其他护林员来说，文明原本是他们的家，但荒野成为他们的第二故乡。",
	"Think of your character's backstory and decide what terrain feels most like home, whether or not you were born there. What does that terrain say about your personality? Does it influence which spells you choose to learn? Have your experiences there shaped who your favored enemies are?": "想一想你的角色的背景故事，决定什么地形最像你的家，无论你是否出生在那里。这种地形对你的性格有什么影响？它是否影响你选择学习哪些法术？你在那里的经历是否塑造了你最喜欢的敌人是谁？",
	"You patrolled an ancient forest, darkened and corrupted by several crossings to the Shadowfell.": "你在一个古老的森林里巡逻，由于几次穿越到阴影地带而变得黑暗和腐朽。",
	"As part of a group of nomads, you acquired the skills for surviving in the desert.": "作为一群游牧民族的一部分，你获得了在沙漠中生存的技能。",
	"Your early life in the Underdark prepared you for the challenges of combating its denizens.": "你早年在暗黑世界的生活为你准备好了对抗暗黑世界居民的挑战。",
	"You dwelled on the edge of a swamp, in an area imperiled by land creatures as well as aquatic ones.": "你住在沼泽的边缘，在一个受到陆地生物和水生生物威胁的地区。",
	"Because you grew up among the peaks, finding the best path through the mountains is second nature to you.": "因为你是在山峰间长大的，对你来说，找到穿越山脉的最佳路径是你的第二天性。",
	"You wandered the far north, learning how to protect yourself and prosper in a realm overrun by ice.": "你在遥远的北方游荡，学习如何保护自己，并在一个被冰雪覆盖的王国里繁荣发展。",
	"Every ranger begins with a favored enemy (or two). The determination of a favored enemy might be tied to a specific event in the character's early life, or it might be entirely a matter of choice.": "每个游侠开始时都有一个（或两个）喜欢的敌人。敌人的确定可能与角色早期生活中的特定事件有关，也可能完全是一个选择问题。",
	"What spurred your character to select a particular enemy? Was the choice made because of tradition or curiosity, or do you have a grudge to settle?": "是什么刺激了你的角色选择一个特定的敌人？是由于传统或好奇心而做出的选择，还是你有怨恨要解决？",
	"You seek revenge on nature's behalf for the great transgressions your foe has committed.": "你代表自然界为你的敌人所犯的巨大过错寻求报复。",

You gain the Canny benefit below, and you gain an additional benefit below when you reach 6th level and 10th level in this class.": "你是一个无与伦比的探险家和幸存者，无论是在荒野中还是在旅行中与他人打交道。你获得以下的 \"狡猾 \"属性，当你达到6级和10级时，你将获得以下的额外属性。",
