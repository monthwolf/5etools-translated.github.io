	"A rune scribe masters the secrets of the runes of power—ancient sigils that embody the fundamental magic of creation. The giants were the first to master rune magic, though many other races eventually stole away or traded for that power.": "符文抄写员掌握着力量符文的秘密--体现创造的基本魔法的古老符号。巨人是第一个掌握符文魔法的人，尽管许多其他种族最终偷走了这种力量，或者用它来交换。",
	"Rune magic is exceedingly rare. Some of its secrets have been lost, and what lore remains is jealously guarded. Few rune scribes share their lore with others. Indeed, most rune scribes take on new students only if doing so allows them to gain access to a forgotten or missing rune. The rune scribe prestige class uses the rules for rune magic presented at the end of this article.": "符文魔法是非常罕见的。它的一些秘密已经失传，剩下的传说也被小心翼翼地保护着。很少有符文抄写员与他人分享他们的理论。事实上，大多数符文抄写员只有在这样做能让他们获得被遗忘或丢失的符文时才会招收新学生。符文抄写员的声望等级使用本文末尾介绍的符文魔法规则。",
	"You can spend another short rest doing nothing but meditating on the rune to end your attunement to it.": "你可以再花一个短暂的休息时间，什么都不做，只对符文进行冥想，以结束你对它的调适。",
	"Runes are a part of the living world, and your studies allow you to connect to their magic in increasingly powerful ways. At 4th level, you learn to incorporate rune magic into your identity, allowing you to augment your body and mind. At the end of a long rest, you can choose to increase one ability score of your choice by 2 or increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. At the end of each subsequent long rest, you can alter this choice, reducing the scores you previously increased and improving different scores. (If you chose to increase two abilities, you can opt to alter only one of those choices.)": "符文是生命世界的一部分，你的学习使你能够以越来越强大的方式连接到它们的魔法。在4级时，你学会将符文魔法融入你的身份，使你能够增强你的身体和心灵。在长时间休息结束时，你可以选择将你选择的一项能力得分提高2分，或将你选择的两项能力得分提高1分。在随后的每次长时间休息结束时，你可以改变这一选择，减少你之前提高的得分并提高不同的得分。(如果你选择增加两个能力，你可以选择只改变其中一个选择）。",
	"At 5th level, you attain the ability to master an ever-greater range of runic magic. When you attune to a rune, you can choose to have it not count toward your limit of attuned magic items. You can be attuned to only one such rune in this manner at a time. You can use this ability again after you end your attunement to a rune.": "在5级时，你获得了掌握更多符文魔法的能力，范围越来越大。当你适应一个符文时，你可以选择让它不计入你所适应的魔法物品的上限。你每次只能以这种方式与一个这样的符文相适应。在你结束对一个符文的调和后，你可以再次使用这个能力。"
