Some believe that one god (probably Bontu) has corrupted the process of the trials and the path to the afterlife. Others correctly intuit that the God-Pharaoh did not actually have the people's best interests in mind when he ordered their society.": "一些异议者受到恐惧的刺激，不想让自己在试验中（或为试验进行训练）遭受暴力死亡。有些人受良心的驱使，不愿意在审判中杀死他们的庄稼人。因为虽然他们不能否认神的存在，但他们可以否认神是公正的--并且可以通过斗争来证明不公正的神的命令不需要被服从。一些人认为，一个神（可能是邦图）破坏了试炼的过程和通往来世的道路。其他人正确地直觉到，神-法老在命令他们的社会时，实际上并没有考虑到人民的最大利益。",

A comfortable place to live and regular meals are provided to you by servitor mummies (the anointed) under the supervision of viziers. You can enjoy these benefits only as long as you obey the societal norms of Naktamun—training for the trials (with or without your crop), obeying the orders of the gods, and following the instructions of their viziers. If you violate these norms, you risk being treated as a dissenter.

	"The five gods embody the five virtues the God-Pharaoh wishes to cultivate in those who will become his Eternals in the afterlife. Each god is responsible for modeling and teaching one of those virtues to the acolytes and initiates of Naktamun, and then testing those initiates to ensure that they have mastered their teachings. Thus, they are present during the acolytes' first lessons, during the Ceremony of Measuring, during the initiates' intense training, and at each of the trials that are part of an initiate's journey.": "这五位神体现了神-法老希望在那些将在来世成为他的永恒的人身上培养的五种美德。每位神明都负责向纳克塔门的圣徒和入门者示范和传授其中一种美德，然后测试这些入门者，以确保他们掌握了他们的教义。因此，他们出现在圣徒的第一节课上，出现在测量仪式上，出现在入会者的紧张训练中，也出现在入会者旅程中的每一次考验中。",
	"In the absence of the God-Pharaoh, only the gods can determine whether initiates have proven themselves worthy of the glory of the afterlife. The gods in turn prove their own worthiness by executing their duties infallibly. They make the trials as challenging as possible to ensure that only the most worthy are selected.": "在没有神-法老的情况下，只有诸神才能确定入会者是否证明自己配得上来世的荣耀。反过来，诸神通过无误地执行他们的职责来证明自己的价值。他们使试验尽可能具有挑战性，以确保只有最有价值的人被选中。",

	"It falls to Rhonas to instill this teaching in those who would enter the afterlife—but to his mind, the words themselves don't matter. Strength can't be taught. It must be built through practice and training. Rhonas demonstrates his teachings by his example, rather than by giving his students any kind of academic instruction. He welcomes the people of Naktamun to stand by the Hekma and watch him as he storms into the desert to battle the greatest horrors. He encourages them to observe his indomitable strength, for though they will never equal it, they can aspire to mimicry. He invites them to scrutinize every move and practice what they see.": "向那些将进入来世的人灌输这一教导的任务落在了罗纳斯身上--但在他看来，这些话本身并不重要。力量是教不来的。它必须通过实践和训练来建立。罗纳斯通过他的榜样来证明他的教义，而不是给他的学生任何形式的学术指导。他欢迎纳克塔蒙的人们站在赫克马身边，看着他冲进沙漠与最可怕的东西战斗。他鼓励他们观察他不屈不挠的力量，因为虽然他们永远无法与之相比，但他们可以渴望模仿。他邀请他们仔细观察每一个动作，并实践他们所看到的东西。",

Her viziers subtly plant the seeds that flower into the ambition the God-Pharaoh desires. Through insinuation, they remind acolytes and initiates alike that achieving one's place in the afterlife at the expense of others is not shameful, but is proof of the initiate's determination and drive. Nothing is more important than that drive, they suggest—not the bonds of a crop, not friendship or love. Not even devotion to a deity.": "邦图已经完全接受了这一箴言，虽然她没有花什么力气来教导它，但她肯定以身作则。她的大臣们巧妙地播下种子，使其开花结果，成为神-法老所期望的雄心壮志。通过暗示，他们提醒信徒和入门者，以牺牲他人的利益来实现自己在来世的地位并不可耻，而是证明了入门者的决心和动力。他们建议，没有什么比这种动力更重要，不是作物的纽带，不是友谊或爱情。甚至对神灵的奉献也不重要。",

Hazoret is charged with cultivating this zeal in the initiates who come under her care, and she has undertaken the task with appropriate enthusiasm. She recognizes, however, that the best way to teach zeal is by demonstrating it.": "神-法老期望那些他欢迎进入来世的人对它的渴望超过所有其他的快乐和成就，并期望他们通过他们的行动来显示他们的奉献、激情和狂热。哈佐雷特负责培养在她照料下的入门者的这种热情，她以适当的热情承担了这项任务。然而，她认识到，教导热情的最佳方式是通过展示它。",
	"An initiate's life is focused on the trials, but it doesn't need to be all about the trials. Though some initiates are highly focused on their training, most undergo that training while also experiencing joy, sorrow, love, loss, anger, jealousy, hope, faith, delight—the whole range of mortal emotions and experience. The afterlife might be a constant presence in every initiate's mind, but it is the culmination of a life well-lived—not a replacement for it.": "入门弟子的生活以考验为中心，但不需要全部是考验。虽然有些入门者高度专注于他们的训练，但大多数人在接受训练的同时也经历了快乐、悲伤、爱、失落、愤怒、嫉妒、希望、信仰、喜悦--整个凡人的情绪和经验。来世可能是每个入门者头脑中的一个永恒的存在，但它是一个良好的生活的顶点，而不是对它的替代。",
