	"Born from the minds of the gods, the creatures that populate the gods' realm are called Nyxborn. Nyxborn creatures resemble mortal beings, but philosophers debate their true character. Are they idealized forms of mortal beings, free from the imperfections and transience that causes mortals to suffer and die? Or are they hollow and soulless shades, lacking the authenticity and pathos that make mortal existence worthwhile?": "诞生于众神的心灵，居住在众神领域的生物被称为(Nyxborn)。Nyxborn生物看起来像凡人，但哲学家们就它们的真实本质展开了讨论。它们是凡人的理想化形式，摆脱了导致凡人痛苦和死亡的不完美和短暂吗？还是它们是空洞无魂的幽灵，缺乏使凡人存在有价值的真实性和悲剧性？",
	"A Nyxborn is like a fragment of divinity, an idea or a dream that is incarnate.

	"These ideas, dreams, memories, and feelings are the stuff Nyx is made of, and a Nyxborn is shaped from that raw material. You might have been specifically crafted by one of the gods to serve a certain purpose. Or your existence could be an accident caused by a confluence of supernatural forces. The Nyxborn Origin table offers a handful of suggestions that might explain how you came to be, and the Nyxborn Quirks table describes some special effects that might linger around your person.": "这些想法，梦想，记忆和感情构成了尼克斯(Nyx)的本质，而尼克斯出生于这种原材料。你可能是由众神之一特别创造出来以履行某种特定目的。或者你的存在可能是由一系列超自然力量的汇合造成的意外。尼克斯出生起源表提供了一些可能解释你来到这个世界的方式，而尼克斯特质表描述了一些可能围绕你周围存在的特殊效果。",

Consult the Oracle Curse table to determine what unwanted revelations you receive.": "你拥有一份珍贵的礼物，不仅被凡人所垂涎，连众神也觊觎：与凡人和神灵领域之间清晰沟通的能力。作为一个神谕者，你能感知神灵的心思，并请求他们给予你他们广博洞察的一瞥。然而，这份礼物也伴随着一种诅咒，通常表现为可怕的洞察。请参考神谕诅咒表，确定你会收到什么不受欢迎的启示。",
	"The gods give you flashes of insight that help you bring your efforts to fruition. When you make an ability check, you can roll a {@dice d10} and add the number rolled to the check.

	"When you cast {@spell alter self} using this feature, some cosmetic aspect of your second form remains after the spell ends. This visibly marks you unless you actively hide or disguise it. The mark is a perceptible change such as scaly skin, stunted wings, eyes without pupils, or horns. The mark fades after you finish a long rest.": "当你使用此特性施放{@spell alter self}时，你的第二形态会保留一些化妆方面的特征，直到法术结束。除非你主动隐藏或伪装，否则这会让你显眼。这个标记是一个可察觉的变化，比如鳞片皮肤、矮小的翅膀、无瞳孔的眼睛或者角。这个标记在你完成一次长休后会消失。",
