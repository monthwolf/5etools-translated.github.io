	"When an avalanche stops, the snow and other debris settle and bury creatures. A creature buried in this way is {@condition blinded} and {@condition restrained}, and it has total cover. The creature gains 1 level of {@condition exhaustion} for every 5 minutes it spends buried. It can try to dig itself free as an action, breaking the surface and ending the {@condition blinded} and {@condition restrained} conditions on itself with a successful DC 15 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. A creature that fails this check three times can't attempt to dig itself out again.": "当雪崩停止时，雪和其他碎片会沉淀下来，埋葬生物。以这种方式被埋葬的生物被称为{@condition blinded}和{@condition restrained}，并且它完全被覆盖。每5分钟被埋葬的生物会获得1级{@condition exhaustion}。它可以尝试作为一个动作挣脱出来，通过成功的DC 15力量检定({@skill Athletics})打破表面，结束自身的{@condition blinded}和{@condition restrained}状态。失败三次的生物不能再尝试挣脱。",

	"A blizzard's howling wind limits hearing to a range of 100 feet and imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls. It also imposes disadvantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on hearing.

A creature falls at the end of its turn if it is flying by nonmagical means and can't hover.": "暴风雪呼啸的风限制了听觉范围在100英尺内，并对远程武器攻击投掷造成劣势。它还对依赖听觉的感知{@skill Perception}检定造成劣势。风会吹灭明火，驱散雾气，在雪地上抹去足迹，并使非魔法手段飞行几乎不可能。如果一只生物正在通过非魔法手段飞行且无法悬停，那么在其回合结束时会坠落。",

	"Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of {@condition exhaustion}. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.": "每当温度达到或低于0华氏度时，暴露在寒冷中的生物必须在每个小时结束时成功通过一次DC 10的体质豁免检定，否则会获得{@condition exhaustion}的一级。对于对寒冷伤害具有抗性或免疫力的生物，以及穿着抗寒装备（厚外套、手套等）和天生适应寒冷气候的生物，均自动通过豁免检定。",
	"When the temperature is at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of {@condition exhaustion}.

	"Sooty thunderclouds shot through with red and orange lightning release a deluge of fiery droplets. Any creature caught in the burning rain takes {@dice 2d6} fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The droplets ignite any flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried; otherwise, the droplets burn out immediately. The smoke, soot, crackle, and low roar of the storm impose disadvantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks and ranged attack rolls.": "被布满红色和橙色闪电的乌云所覆盖，释放出一阵火焰雨。任何被困在燃烧雨中的生物，在其回合开始时受到{@dice 2d6}火焰伤害。这些火焰雨会点燃任何未被穿戴或携带的易燃物品；否则，火焰雨会立即熄灭。这场风暴的烟雾、煤灰、爆裂声和低沉的吼声会让感知({@skill Perception})检定和远程攻击投掷承受劣势。",
	"Supernaturally powerful winds—like those from planes such as Pandemonium or Minethys, the third layer of Carceri—can spawn flaywinds. A flaywind is an intense sandstorm, gathering large rocks and other debris in addition to sand or grit.

Only substantial cover or shelter offers protection against the flensing grit.": "超自然强大的风——就像来自诸如混乱地狱飞机或卡塞里的第三层迷涂斯的风——可能会产生剥风。剥风是一场强烈的沙尘暴，除了沙子或砂砾外，还会携带大块岩石和其他碎片。风暴内的区域被严重遮蔽，暴露在风暴中的生物在每个回合开始时会受到{@dice 1d4}的割伤伤害。只有实质性的掩护或庇护可以保护免受磨皮砂砾的伤害。",
	"A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects.

The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Any magic that neutralizes poison or cures disease kills the infestation.
