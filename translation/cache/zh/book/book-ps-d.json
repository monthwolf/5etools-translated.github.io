	"Dominaria is an enormous plane, with numerous landmasses separated by vast oceans. This article, though, focuses on the continent of Aerona and its surrounding lands, which are collectively known as the Domains.": "多米尼亚是一个巨大的平面，有无数的陆地被广阔的海洋所分隔。本文主要介绍爱罗娜大陆及其周围的土地，它们被统称为领域。",
	"The continent of Aerona is sharply split between its northern and southern parts, with the division marked by a wide bay and a forbidding mountain range.": "艾罗纳大陆的北部和南部截然分开，分界线是一个宽阔的海湾和一座令人生畏的山脉。",
	"The southern part of Aerona is dominated by {@b Benalia}, the foremost mercantile and military power on Dominaria. It spreads along the western coast and out to the nearby islands, including the Isle of Avenant to the north and much of the Spice Isles to the west. Though most famous for their fertile fields, the lands of Benalia also include old-growth forests, rolling mountains, and a lengthy coastline.": "艾罗纳的南部由{@b Benalia}主导，是多米尼亚最重要的商业和军事力量。它沿西海岸延伸到附近的岛屿，包括北边的阿维南特岛和西边的香料群岛的大部分地区。虽然贝纳利亚的土地以其肥沃的田地而闻名，但也包括古老的森林、连绵的山脉和漫长的海岸线。",
	"South and east of Benalia lie the impassable tangles of the {@b Llanowar} forest. Llanowar is populated by diverse elven societies that are threatened by the goblins and orcs of the Ironclaw Mountains.": "贝纳利亚的南部和东部是难以通行的{@b Llanowar}森林的纠结。拉诺瓦（Llanowar）的居民是多样化的精灵社会，他们受到铁爪山的地精和兽人的威胁。",
	"Land passage through Benalia to the east coast of Aerona is virtually impossible thanks to the peaks of the Ironclaws, but the Benalish are the preeminent naval power in the region. By informal but frequently reiterated agreement, Benalish ships stay out of the Voda Sea, and the merfolk of {@b Vodalia} allow shipping to pass along Aerona's coastlines largely unhindered. This command of Aerona's southern coasts allows the Benalish to maintain a permanent presence in Sursi on the east coast of the continent.": "由于铁爪峰的存在，通过贝纳里亚到艾罗纳东海岸的陆地通道几乎是不可能的，但贝纳里亚人是该地区最杰出的海军力量。根据非正式但经常重申的协议，贝纳利什的船只不进入沃达海，而{@b Vodalia}的人鱼则允许航运在很大程度上不受阻碍地沿着艾罗纳的海岸线通过。这种对艾罗纳南部海岸的控制使贝纳利什人能够在该大陆东海岸的苏尔西保持长期存在。",
	"To the northeast of Benalia are the Red Iron Mountains, which divide the more sparsely populated northern half of Aerona from the lands to the south. The mountains' native Crookshank kobolds fared poorly during the chaos of the Rift Years, and the mountains are now dotted with Benalish mining settlements.": "贝纳里亚的东北部是红铁山脉，它将人口较稀少的艾罗纳北半部与南部的土地分割开来。在裂变年代的混乱中，山上的原生克罗克桑克哥布林过得很糟糕，现在山上到处都是贝纳利什人的采矿定居点。",
	"To the east, the Red Iron Mountains divide as the continent does, with the Ironcrowns veering off to the south. The northern branch becomes the formidable peaks of the Hurloon Mountains, home of a peaceful but reclusive nation of minotaurs. The occasional Benalish trading mission ventures into Hurloon, but permanent settlements and Serran missionaries are met with open hostility.": "在东部，红铁山脉与大陆一样分界，铁鸦山脉向南偏移。北部分支成为赫伦山脉的可怕山峰，是一个和平但隐居的牛头人国家的家园。偶尔有贝纳利什人的贸易代表团进入休伦山，但永久定居点和塞兰人的传教士会遭到公开的敌视。",
	"The forbidding subcontinent north of Aerona is Icehaven, home to the warrior nation of {@b Keld}. Keldon raiders and Benalish colonists now clash regularly along the west coast of northern Aerona, both seeking to control the relatively narrow stretch of land between the Sea of Avenant and the Whispering Woods to the east.": "艾罗纳北部令人生畏的次大陆是冰港，是{@b Keld}战士国家的家园。凯尔登突袭者和贝纳利什殖民者现在经常在爱罗纳北部的西海岸发生冲突，双方都在寻求控制阿维南特海和东部的低语森林之间相对狭窄的土地。",
	"West of Benalia spreads a vast ocean dotted with islands. The most prominent of the {@b Tolarian Academies}, Tolaria West, is situated in the northwestern Spice Isles. (A second Tolarian Academy is situated on Walassa to the east of Aerona, part of the mercantile empire of Orvada.)": "在贝纳利亚的西部，散布着一片广阔的海洋，上面点缀着许多岛屿。其中最突出的{@b Tolarian Academies}，托拉里亚西，位于香料岛的西北部。(第二所托拉里昂学院位于艾罗纳东部的瓦拉萨，是奥瓦达商业帝国的一部分）。",
	"Benalia is a land of natural and architectural beauty: vast fields of sun-kissed grain crisscrossed by meandering rivers and dotted with cities of white limestone towers and vivid stained glass. One would hardly guess that less than a century before, this great empire was fractured, its people scattered, and its shining capital city a salt-choked ruin. Today, the seven noble houses of Benalia once again rule one of the most prosperous and powerful nations of Dominaria. The Benalish are keenly aware that their New Benalia is in its infancy, with a thousand years of heroic ancestors and tales of bravery to live up to. But they are a diligent people—and proud enough to consider themselves equal to the task.": "贝纳里亚是一片具有自然和建筑之美的土地：广袤的阳光亲吻的谷物田，蜿蜒的河流纵横交错，点缀着白色石灰岩塔楼和鲜艳的彩色玻璃的城市。人们很难想象，在不到一个世纪之前，这个伟大的帝国已经四分五裂，人民四散，其闪亮的首都成为盐碱地上的废墟。今天，贝纳利雅的七个贵族家族再次统治了多米尼亚最繁荣和强大的国家之一。贝纳利什人敏锐地意识到，他们的新贝纳利亚还处于起步阶段，有一千年的英雄祖先和勇敢的故事要去实现。但他们是一个勤奋的民族--而且足够自豪，认为自己能够胜任这项工作。",
	"Benalia is an empire poised for expansion, and many of its greatest heroes are part of its strong and growing array of military forces.": "贝纳利亚是一个准备扩张的帝国，许多最伟大的英雄都是其强大且不断增长的军事力量的一部分。",

	"Consider any of the following class options for a Benalish character.": "考虑以下任何一个贝纳利什角色的等级选择。",
	"The priests who march with the armies of Benalia are consecrated by the Serran church—and are technically part of its ecclesiastical hierarchy. In practice, though, they serve more as military officers than as clergy. Benalish clerics inspire their charges to great feats of glory and heroism, bolstering them with the blessings of Serra.": "与贝纳里亚军队一起行军的牧师都是由塞兰教会祝圣的--从技术上讲，他们是教会等级制度的一部分。但实际上，他们更多的是作为军官而不是作为神职人员服务。贝纳利什的教士们激励他们的士兵完成伟大的荣耀和英雄主义壮举，用塞拉的祝福支持他们。",
	"Benalish fighters drawn from the noble houses are often elite knights. They are responsible for security for Benalish lords and their manors, and make up the core of military forces in the field. Noble fighters also serve as officers for the soldiery, but many people from the common classes also rise to officer ranks. Each of the noble houses maintains its own standing army, but several legions of professional soldiers tithed from the different houses make up the backbone of the Benalish fighting force.": "贝纳利什的战士来自贵族家庭，通常是精锐的骑士。他们负责保护贝纳利什领主及其庄园的安全，并构成了战场上军事力量的核心。贵族战士还担任士兵的军官，但许多来自普通阶层的人也能升到军官级别。每个贵族家族都有自己的常备军，但几个由不同家族征收的职业士兵军团构成了贝纳利什战斗力的骨干。",
	"Warriors who combine loyalty to Benalia with devotion to Serra might join the ranks of Benalia's knights if they come from noble blood. This is particularly true of the members of House Capashen, who have a long heritage of worshiping Serra.": "将对贝纳里亚的忠诚与对塞拉的奉献结合起来的勇士，如果他们出身于贵族血统，就可能加入贝纳里亚的骑士行列。卡帕森家族的成员更是如此，他们有着崇拜塞拉的悠久传统。",

	"The most visible and recognized symbols of the Church of Serra are her angels—both those that were personally created by Serra and those that appeared spontaneously in the Cathedral at Sursi. Some angels live contemplative lives within the cathedrals, but most are active defenders of the faith, protecting Serra's people across the world. Powerful angels often take responsibility for large regions of the world. Lyra, for example, stands as the protector of Benalia, and Shalai plays a similar role in Llanowar. Serra's angels are believed to hear prayers addressed to Serra, and they have an uncanny tendency to arrive exactly when they are needed.": "塞拉教会最明显和公认的象征是她的天使--既有塞拉亲自创造的天使，也有自发出现在苏尔西大教堂的那些天使。一些天使在大教堂内过着沉思的生活，但大多数天使是信仰的积极捍卫者，保护世界各地的塞拉的子民。强大的天使往往负责世界上的大片区域。例如，天琴（Lyra）是贝纳利亚（Benalia）的保护者，沙莱（Shalai）在拉诺瓦（Llanowar）扮演着类似的角色。人们相信塞拉的天使会听到向塞拉发出的祈祷，而且他们有一种不可思议的倾向，即在需要他们的时候准确到达。",

You can use the following tables to help inspire adventure ideas dealing with the Church of Serra.": "作为世界上一股主要的正义力量，塞拉教会更有可能作为英雄冒险家的守护者而不是对手。也就是说，即使是最善意的圣骑士也会因为被误导的热情或被阴险的力量所操纵而具有反派的性质。你可以使用以下表格来帮助激发涉及塞拉教会的冒险想法。",

Members of different lineages typically focus on different subjects, employ different teaching styles, adhere to different ethical standards, use different jargon, and even adopt distinct accents when addressing students. At least in theory, members of other classes can study at the Tolarian Academies, though some amount of magical talent is a requirement for entry. An eldritch knight or arcane trickster might learn magic there while honing other skills, or a sorcerer might try to elevate the mastery of their innate abilities through rigorous arcane study.": "托拉里昂是一所{@class wizard}学校，学院里几乎每个人--学生、教师、学者和行政人员--都是精通或学习魔法的巫师。每个学院内的教授都可以将他们的教育历史追溯到最初的托拉里昂学院的不同成员，包括乌尔扎、巴林和雷恩。不同血统的成员通常专注于不同的科目，采用不同的教学风格，遵守不同的道德标准，使用不同的行话，甚至在对学生讲话时采用不同的口音。至少在理论上，其他阶级的成员也可以在托拉里昂学院学习，尽管一定程度上的魔法天赋是入学的要求。一个长生骑士或奥术师可能会在那里学习魔法，同时磨练其他技能，或者一个巫师可能会试图通过严格的奥术学习来提高对其天生能力的掌握。",

Though it is possible for a surface power to harm the merfolk, doing so is difficult—and the Vodalians can easily retaliate by locking down oceanic travel if necessary. At present, the Vodalians charge for safe passage through their seas, but they take no sides in the political struggles of the surface. But if anything should upset that delicate balance, an opportunity might arise for adventurous characters to right the situation.": "正如他们在多米尼亚的大部分历史中一样，人鱼族和他们的水生对手和盟友的斗争几乎完全是在海面下进行的，不在世界表面文化的视野和思想中。虽然地表势力有可能伤害到人鱼族，但这样做是很困难的--如果有必要，沃达利亚人可以轻易地通过封锁海洋旅行来进行报复。目前，沃达利亚人对通过其海域的安全通道收取费用，但他们不参与地表的政治斗争。但是，如果有什么事情打破了这种微妙的平衡，冒险的人物可能会有机会纠正这种情况。",
	"Because Vodalian merfolk find it challenging to accomplish business in the surface world, they often use agents of other races to undertake quests and missions among the air-breathing peoples.

In reality, however, the Llanowar are a reclusive people, and careful visitors can enter and leave their domain without ever seeing its inhabitants. When the Llanowar elves are seen, it is because they wish to be seen—and often to an intruder's detriment.": "很少有外人敢于冒险进入广阔而古老的拉诺瓦森林，那里巨大的古老树木耸立在离地面一千英尺的地方。在这些树中生活着凶猛的拉诺瓦精灵，他们的野蛮外表和仇外敌意的名声足以让其他大多数人甚至远离森林的阴影。然而，在现实中，拉诺瓦人是一个隐居的民族，谨慎的游客可以在没有看到居民的情况下进出他们的领域。当拉诺瓦精灵被看到时，那是因为他们希望被看到，而且往往对入侵者不利。",

Most believe that Freyalise was an avatar or aspect of Gaea in life—and some still pray to her, believing that she continues to take that role in death. But even the faithful of Freyalise are likely to pray directly to Gaea most days. That said, the druids of Llanowar are not just a religious order. They are a professional philosophical class, with different orders filling different social and religious roles among the elves. Some orders consist of poets, bards, and historians who collect and preserve the lore of Llanowar and its peoples for future generations. Others are made up of astronomers, mathematicians, and navigators, who use their esoteric knowledge to predict weather and astronomical events. Most importantly, the druids serve as the judicial system, both investigating complaints and judging the accused.": "自从精灵行者弗雷亚里斯死后，拉诺瓦的精灵们转向了对生命和自然女神盖亚的崇拜。大多数人相信弗里亚利斯生前是盖亚的化身，或者说是盖亚的一个方面--有些人仍然向她祈祷，相信她死后会继续扮演这个角色。但即使是弗雷亚丽斯的信徒，大多数时候也可能直接向盖亚祈祷。也就是说，拉诺瓦的德鲁伊们不仅仅是一个宗教团体。他们是一个专业的哲学阶层，不同的教团在精灵中扮演着不同的社会和宗教角色。有些教团由诗人、吟游诗人和历史学家组成，他们为后代收集和保存拉诺瓦和其人民的传说。另一些则由天文学家、数学家和航海家组成，他们利用自己深奥的知识来预测天气和天文事件。最重要的是，德鲁伊们充当了司法系统，既调查投诉又审判被告。",

	"The most well-known cultural feature of the Llanowar elves is a reclusiveness that borders on xenophobia. This distrust has varied in its degree and harshness throughout history—and it can vary more widely among the different societies of Llanowar. Some elves conduct cautious trade at carefully patrolled border sites, while others harshly punish any transgression of their unwritten laws.": "拉诺瓦精灵最著名的文化特征是一种近乎于排外的排外性。这种不信任在整个历史中的程度和严酷程度是不同的--在拉诺瓦的不同社会中，它的差异更大。一些精灵在仔细巡逻的边界地点进行谨慎的贸易，而另一些精灵则严厉惩罚任何违反其不成文法律的行为。",
	"Many Llanowar elves dislike leaving the protective eaves of the forest. So when danger arises outside the boundaries of the wood, elfhame leaders might send the more restless young elves of their community to face the danger—or they might ask (or call in) a favor from outside adventurers.": "许多拉诺瓦精灵不喜欢离开森林的保护性屋檐。因此，当危险出现在森林的边界之外时，精灵殿堂的领导人可能会派他们社区中更不安分的年轻精灵去面对危险，或者他们可能会请求（或叫来）外部冒险家的帮助。",

	"This work isn't comprehensive, of course. As always, {@i The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Dominaria} is the definitive resource, but even that book could only scratch the surface of Dominaria. The art book was built on the world guide, and the world guide specifically chose ten regions of the world—two per mana color—as a focus for the card set. Of those ten regions, seven are either located on or around the continent of Aerona or have a significant impact on it. For that reason, I made the decision in this article to focus on the Domains, omitting the regions of Urborg, Shiv, and Yavimaya. I figured that leaving those out would diminish the temptation for characters to circumnavigate a globe that includes so many regions already omitted from the art book. That said, the art book includes a complete map, and the Internet is home to abundant information about Dominaria (especially on {@link the Magic Website|https://magic.wizards.com/en}). So if you want to expand your campaign beyond Aerona, you should have little trouble doing so.": "这项工作当然并不全面。一如既往，{@i The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Dominaria}是权威资源，但即便是那本书也只是触及了多米纳利亚的表面。艺术书是基于世界指南构建的，而世界指南明确选择了世界的十个地区——每个魔力颜色两个——作为卡牌套装的焦点。在这十个地区中，有七个位于或周围的亚罗那大陆，或对其产生重大影响。因此，我在这篇文章中决定专注于领域，省略了乌尔博格、希夫和亚维玛亚的地区。我认为省略这些地区会减少人物绕过已经省略在艺术书中的许多地区的诱惑。话虽如此，艺术书包含了一张完整的地图，互联网上也有关于多米纳利亚的丰富信息（尤其是在{@link the Magic Website|https://magic.wizards.com/en}上）。因此，如果你想将你的战役扩展到亚罗那之外，你应该不会遇到太多困难。",

	"Many different ranks of priests fill the church hierarchy, but they all serve the same essential functions of ministering to the populace and interpreting the teachings of Serra. Priests who go out into the world and spread Serra's word are known as missionaries. As a cleric of Serra, you can choose from the {@class Cleric||Knowledge|Knowledge}, {@class Cleric||Life|Life}, {@class Cleric||Light|Light}, and {@class Cleric||War|War} domains.": "许多不同级别的神职人员填补着教会的等级制度，但他们都履行着同样重要的职能，为民众服务并解释Serra的教义。走出世界传播Serra之言的神职人员被称为传教士。作为Serra的神职人员，你可以从{@class Cleric||Knowledge|Knowledge}、{@class Cleric||Life|Life}、{@class Cleric||Light|Light}和{@class Cleric||War|War}领域中进行选择。",
	"Even within the peaceful Church of Serra, some are called to fight. Soldiers (called acolytes and guardians) serve a largely ceremonial function, protecting the cathedrals of Serra. But paladins are more worldly, venturing out across the land in search of evil to defeat. Serran paladins typically swear the {@class Paladin||Oath of Devotion|Devotion}. Those who are devoted to the Four Virtues of art, discourse, freedom, and peace are more apt to swear the {@class Paladin||Oath of the Ancients|Ancients}.": "即使在宁静的Serra教会中，也有人被召唤去战斗。士兵（称为侍僧和守护者）主要担任礼仪职能，保护Serra的大教堂。但圣骑士更加世俗，跨越大地寻找邪恶进行战斗。Serra的圣骑士通常宣誓效忠{@class Paladin||Oath of Devotion|Devotion}。那些致力于艺术、辩论、自由和和平这四种美德的人更有可能宣誓效忠{@class Paladin||Oath of the Ancients|Ancients}。",

	"To the mages and scholars of the Tolarian Academies, magic is one science among many. Their books of lore contain eldritch runes as well as elaborate equations, and they employ complex constructs alongside enchanted golems. What happens to bronze if you transmute the tin it contains into iron after smelting? Does introducing an electrical charge enhance the scrying ability of a {@item crystal ball}? To the Tolarians, there's nothing strange or even interdisciplinary about these questions—even if the answer in either case could easily turn out to be: \"It explodes.\"": "对于托拉里亚学院的法师和学者们来说，魔法只是众多科学中的一种。他们的传统书籍中既包含神秘的符文，也有复杂的方程式，他们使用复杂的构造物和附魔傀儡并存。如果你在熔炼后将青铜中的锡转变为铁，青铜会发生什么变化？在{@item crystal ball}中引入电荷会增强占卜的能力吗？对于托拉里亚人来说，这些问题并不奇怪，甚至不跨学科，尽管在任一情况下答案很容易就会是：“它爆炸了。”",

	"In its cells throughout the world, the Cabal has need for more than prayer. Whether striking from the shadows or venturing out in full regalia to spread open terror, Belzenlok's infiltrators and assassins emphasize what many fear: that the Cabal is already everywhere.

	"Traditional Keldon shamans retain an important place in the warhosts. These shamans are historians as well, keeping alive the link between Keld's past traditions and its present. Their chief responsibility is in maintaining, annotating, and interpreting the enormous Book of Keld. Most Keldon warriors have little patience for reading, so the keepers also act as bards or skalds, recounting the tales within the book to inspire Keldons in battle.
