	"This bestiary is for storytellers and worldbuilders. If you have ever thought about running a Dungeons & Dragons game for your friends, either a single night's adventure or a long-running campaign, this tome contains page after page of inspiration. It's your one-stop shop for creatures both malevolent and benign.": "这本兽皮书是为讲故事的人和构建世界的人准备的。如果你曾想过为你的朋友们开展龙与地下城游戏，无论是一个晚上的冒险还是一个长期的战役，这本小册子包含了一页又一页的灵感。这是你的一站式商店，可以找到邪恶和良性的生物。",
	"Some of the creatures that inhabit the worlds of D&D have origins rooted in real-world mythology and fantasy literature. Other creatures are D&D originals. The monsters in this book have been culled from all previous editions of the game. Herein you'll discover classic critters such as the beholder and the displacer beast next to more recent creations such as the chuul and the twig blight. Common beasts mingle with the weird, the terrifying, and the ridiculous. In collecting monsters from the past, we've endeavored to reflect the multifaceted nature of the game, warts and all. D&D monsters come in all shapes and sizes, with stories that not only thrill us but also make us smile.": "一些居住在D&D世界中的生物起源于现实世界的神话和幻想文学。其他生物则是D&D的原创作品。本书中的怪物是从以前所有版本的游戏中挑选出来的。在这里，你会发现一些经典的小动物，如beholder和displacement beast，还有一些较新的创造，如chuul和twig blight。普通的野兽与怪异的、恐怖的和荒谬的混合在一起。在收集过去的怪物时，我们努力反映出游戏的多面性，包括所有的缺陷。D&D的怪物有各种形状和大小，它们的故事不仅让我们兴奋，也让我们微笑。",
	"The best thing about being a DM is that you get to invent your own fantasy world and bring it to life, and nothing brings a D&D world to life more than the creatures that inhabit it. You might read a monster's entry and be spurred to create an adventure revolving around it, or you might have an awesome idea for a dungeon and need just the right monsters to populate it. That's where the Monster Manual comes in handy.": "做DM的最大好处是，你可以发明你自己的幻想世界，并将其变为现实，而没有什么比居住在D&D世界中的生物更能使其成为现实。你可能会读到一个怪物的条目，然后被刺激到创造一个围绕它的冒险，或者你可能有一个关于地下城的很棒的想法，需要合适的怪物来填充它。这就是《怪物手册》派上用场的地方。",
	"The {@i Monster Manual} is one of three books that form the foundation of the Dungeons & Dragons game, the other two being the {@i Player's Handbook} and the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide.}": "{@i Monster Manual}是构成龙与地下城游戏基础的三本书之一，另外两本书是{@i Player's Handbook}和{@i Dungeon Master's Guide.}",
	"The {@i Monster Manual}, like the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}, is a book for DMs. Use it to populate your D&D adventures with pesky goblins, stinky troglodytes, savage orcs, mighty dragons, and a veritable horde of creepy crawlies.": "{@i Monster Manual}，和{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}一样，是一本为管理员准备的书。用它来填充你的D&D冒险，包括讨厌的地精、恶臭的troglodytes、野蛮的兽人、强大的龙，以及名副其实的爬行生物。",
	"If you've never run a D&D adventure before, we recommend that you pick up the Dungeons & Dragons {@i Starter Set,} which demonstrates how to take a bunch of monsters and build an exciting adventure around them.": "如果你以前从未进行过D&D冒险，我们建议你拿起《龙与地下城》{@i Starter Set,}，它演示了如何利用一堆怪物并围绕它们建立一个令人兴奋的冒险。",
	"A monster is defined as any creature that can be interacted with and potentially fought and killed. Even something as harmless as a frog or as benevolent as a unicorn is a monster by this definition. The term also applies to humans, elves, dwarves, and other civilized folk who might be friends or rivals to the player characters.": "怪物被定义为任何可以与之互动并有可能被战斗和杀死的生物。根据这个定义，即使是像青蛙一样无害的东西或像独角兽一样仁慈的东西也是怪物。这个术语也适用于人类、精灵、矮人和其他可能成为玩家角色的朋友或对手的文明人。",
	"Most of the monsters that haunt the D&D world, however, are threats that are meant to be stopped: rampaging demons, conniving devils, soul-sucking undead, summoned elementals-the list goes on.": "然而，在D&D世界中出没的大多数怪物都是要被制止的威胁：横行霸道的恶魔、纵容的魔鬼、吸食灵魂的亡灵、被召唤的元素--这样的例子不胜枚举。",
	"If you are new to the D&D game, you might not be familiar with the weird and wondrous places where monsters can be found and fought.": "如果你是D&D游戏的新手，你可能不熟悉那些可以找到并与之战斗的怪异而奇妙的怪物的地方。",
	"When most people think of a dungeon, images of dark cells with iron bars and shackles spring to mind. In the D&D game, the word \"dungeon\" takes on a broader meaning to include any enclosed, monster-infested location. Most dungeons are sprawling underground complexes. Here are a few other examples:": "当大多数人想到地牢时，脑海中就会浮现出带有铁栅栏和镣铐的黑暗牢房。在D&D游戏中，\"地牢 \"一词具有更广泛的含义，包括任何封闭的、充满怪物的地方。大多数地牢是庞大的地下建筑群。这里有一些其他的例子。",

	"There is no greater dungeon than the Underdark, the underworld beneath the surface world. It is a vast subterranean realm where monsters accustomed to darkness dwell. It is a place filled with lightless caverns connected by tunnels that wind ever downward. One could spend a lifetime (however brief!) exploring the Underdark and find such places as the following:": "没有比地下城更伟大的地牢了，地下城是地表世界下的地下世界。这是一个巨大的地下世界，住着习惯于黑暗的怪物。这个地方充满了无光的洞穴，由蜿蜒向下的隧道连接。人们可以用一生的时间（无论多么短暂！）来探索地下世界，发现以下这些地方。",

	"Not all monsters lurk underground. Many of them inhabit deserts, mountains, swamps, canyons, forests, and other natural settings. The wilderness can be just as dangerous as any dungeon, particularly when there's nowhere to hide! Some wilderness locations are just as memorable as any dungeon:": "并非所有的怪物都潜伏在地下。他们中的许多人居住在沙漠、山脉、沼泽、峡谷、森林和其他自然环境中。荒野可以和任何地牢一样危险，特别是在无处可藏的情况下！有些荒野的地点和任何地牢一样令人难忘。有些荒野地点和任何地下城一样令人难忘。",

	"A jungle island inhabited by dinosaurs and human tribal warriors": "一个由恐龙和人类部落战士居住的丛林岛屿",
	"Some of the best adventures unfold in the cradles of civilization. Urban settings afford adventurers the chance to rub shoulders with the rich and powerful, butt heads with the dregs of society, and peel back the veneer of civility to see the monstrous evil lurking beneath. Within a medieval town or city are places as deadly as any dungeon:": "一些最好的冒险在文明的摇篮中展开。城市环境为冒险者提供了与富人和权贵擦肩而过的机会，与社会渣滓对峙，剥开文明的外衣，看到潜伏在下面的可怕的邪恶。在中世纪的城镇或城市中，有一些与任何地牢一样致命的地方。",

Such faraway places beckon high-level adventurers to their doorsteps, defying the brave and the foolhardy to overthrow their evil masters and unlock their hidden mysteries. Many powerful, weird creatures live on other planes of existence, from orderly modrons to murderous demons. When it comes to interesting adventure locations, not even the sky is the limit when you pass beyond the boundaries of the world:": "深渊。九层地狱。黄铜之城。这些遥远的地方向高级冒险家们招手，让勇敢的人和愚蠢的人去推翻他们邪恶的主人，揭开他们隐藏的神秘面纱。许多强大、怪异的生物生活在其他存在的星球上，从有序的莫德隆到凶残的恶魔。说到有趣的冒险地点，当你越过世界的边界时，甚至连天空都不是极限。",

	"Many monsters inhabit dungeons, while others live in deserts, forests, labyrinths, and other environments.

	"Despite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a variant or template, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge rating.": "尽管本书中收集了大量的怪物，但当你要为冒险的一部分寻找完美的生物时，你可能会感到茫然。你可以自由地调整现有的生物，使其成为对你更有用的东西，也许可以从不同的怪物身上借用一两个特征，或者使用变体或模板，例如本书中的那些。请记住，修改一个怪物，包括当你对它使用模板时，可能会改变它的挑战等级。",

	"Large": "大型",
	"Gargantuan": "巨大的",
	"20 by 20 ft. or larger": "20乘20英尺或更大",
	"A monster's type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an arrow of dragon slaying deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.": "一个怪物的类型说明了它的基本性质。游戏中的某些法术、魔法物品、等级特征和其他效果以特殊的方式与特定类型的生物进行互动。例如，屠龙之箭不仅对龙造成额外的伤害，而且对其他龙型生物，如龙龟和狼牙棒，也造成额外的伤害。",
	"The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.": "该游戏包括以下怪物类型，它们没有自己的规则。",
	"{@b Aberrations} are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature's alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.": "{@b Aberrations}是完全的外星生物。他们中的许多人拥有与生俱来的魔法能力，这些能力来自于生物的异形思维，而不是世界的神秘力量。最典型的反常者是Aboleths、beholder、mind flayers和slaadi。",

Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.": "{@b Beasts}是非人类的生物，是幻想生态的自然组成部分。它们中的一些具有神奇的力量，但大多数是没有智慧的，缺乏任何社会或语言。野兽包括所有品种的普通动物、恐龙和巨型版本的动物。",
	"{@b Celestials} are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.": "{@b Celestials}是原产于上层世界的生物。他们中的许多人是神灵的仆人，在凡人界和整个星球上被雇为信使或代理人。天人本性善良，所以偏离善良的特殊天人是一种可怕的罕见现象。天人包括天使、库阿特人和佩加西人。",
	"{@b Constructs} are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.": "{@b Constructs}是制造出来的，而不是天生的。有些是由创造者编程，遵循一套简单的指令，而有些则被赋予了智慧，能够进行独立思考。盔甲是标志性的建筑。许多土生土长的麦金努斯星球的生物，比如莫德隆，都是由更强大的生物的意志从星球的原材料中塑造出来的构造体。",
	"{@b Dragons} are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.": "{@b Dragons}是起源古老、力量巨大的大型爬行生物。真龙，包括善良的金属龙和邪恶的色龙，具有高度的智慧和天生的魔法。这一类中还有与真龙有远距离关系的生物，但力量、智慧和魔法都较弱，如狼人和假龙。",
	"{@b Elementals} are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.": "{@b Elementals}是原产于元素界的生物。这种类型的一些生物只不过是其各自元素的有生命的物质，包括简单地称为元素的生物。其他的则是注入了元素能量的生物形态。精灵的种族，包括精灵和伊夫雷特，形成了元素界最重要的文明。其他元素生物包括阿泽尔、隐形潜行者和水鸟。",
	"{@b Fey} are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.": "{@b Fey}是与自然力量紧密相连的神奇生物。他们居住在黄昏的树林和缥缈的森林中。在一些世界中，他们与精灵世界（Feywild）紧密相连，也被称为精灵界。有些也被发现于外部世界，特别是阿波瑞亚（Arborea）和兽地（Beastlands）的平面。妖精包括干尸、小精灵和萨提尔。",
	"{@b Fiends} are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.": "{@b Fiends}是原产于下层世界的邪恶的生物。少数是神明的仆人，但更多的是在大恶魔和恶魔王子的领导下工作。邪恶的牧师和法师有时会将恶魔召唤到物质世界来为他们效劳。如果说邪恶的天人是罕见的，那么好的魔人则几乎是不可想象的。魔鬼包括恶魔、魔鬼、地狱猎犬、罗刹和尤格罗特。",
	"{@b Giants} tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.": "{@b Giants}高过人类和他们的同类。他们的形状类似于人类，尽管有些人有多个头（ETTINS）或畸形（FOMORIAN）。真正的巨人有六种，分别是山丘巨人、石头巨人、冰霜巨人、火焰巨人、云雾巨人和风暴巨人。除了这些，食人魔和巨魔等生物也是巨人。",
	"{@b Humanoids} are the main peoples of the D&D world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.": "{@b Humanoids}是D&D世界的主要民族，既有文明的也有野蛮的，包括人类和种类繁多的其他物种。他们有语言和文化，几乎没有先天的魔法能力（尽管大多数人形生物可以学习法术），并且是两足动物的形态。最常见的类人种族是最适合作为玩家角色的种族：人类、矮人、精灵和半身人。几乎同样多但更野蛮、更凶残，而且几乎一致邪恶的种族是地精（地精、霍布格林和虫熊）、兽人、地精、蜥蜴人和哥布林。",
	"A variety of humanoids appear throughout this book, but the races detailed in the {@i Player's Handbook}-with the exception of drow-are dealt with in appendix B. That appendix gives you a number of stat blocks that you can use to make various members of those races.": "本书中出现了各种人形生物，但{@i Player's Handbook}中详述的种族--除了乌鸦之外--都在附录B中处理。该附录给了你一些状态块，你可以用来制造这些种族的各种成员。",
	"{@b Monstrosities} are monsters in the strictest sense-frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don't fit into any other type.": "{@b Monstrosities}是最严格意义上的怪物--可怕的生物，它们不是普通的，不是真正的自然，而且几乎没有良性的。有些是魔法实验出错的结果（如猫头鹰熊），有些是可怕的诅咒的产物（包括牛头人和元神）。它们无法归类，在某种意义上说，它们是不适合任何其他类型的生物的总括性类别。",
	"{@b Oozes} are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.": "{@b Oozes}是胶状的生物，很少有固定的形状。它们大多在地下，居住在山洞和地牢中，以垃圾、腐肉或不幸挡住它们去路的生物为食。黑色的布丁和胶状的方块是最容易识别的渗出物之一。",
	"{@b Plants} in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.": "{@b Plants}在这里指的是植物性生物，而不是普通的植物群。它们中的大多数是流动的，有些是食肉的。最典型的植物是晃动的小丘和树人。真菌类生物，如气体孢子和霉菌类也属于这一类别。",
	"{@b Undead} are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.": "{@b Undead}是曾经活着的生物，通过使用死灵魔法或一些邪恶的诅咒，被带到了可怕的不死状态。亡灵包括行尸走肉，如吸血鬼和僵尸，以及无体的精神，如鬼魂和幽灵。",
	"A monster's alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the {@i Player's Handbook} for descriptions of the different alignments.": "怪物的排列组合提供了一条线索，说明它的性格以及它在角色扮演或战斗中的行为方式。例如，混沌邪恶的怪物可能很难与之讲道理，并可能一见面就攻击角色，而中立的怪物则可能愿意进行谈判。请参阅{@i Player's Handbook}中对不同结盟的描述。",
	"The alignment specified in a monster's stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster's alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there's nothing stopping you. Some creatures can have any alignment. In other words, you choose the monster's alignment. Some monster's alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.": "在怪物的状态块中指定的排列方式是默认的。你可以自由地偏离它，改变怪物的排列，以适应你的活动的需要。如果你想要一个善良的绿龙或邪恶的风暴巨人，没有什么可以阻止你。有些生物可以有任何对齐方式。换句话说，你可以选择怪物的对齐方式。有些怪物的对准条目表示对法律、混乱、善或恶的倾向或厌恶。例如，一个狂暴战士可以是任何混乱的对准（混乱的好，混乱的中立，或混乱的邪恶），这与它的野性相称。",
	"Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don't make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are unaligned, which means they don't have an alignment.": "许多智力低下的生物对法律或混乱、善或恶没有理解力。他们不做道德或伦理上的选择，而是凭本能行事。这些生物是不结盟的，这意味着他们没有一个结盟。",
	"A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster's AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.": "穿着盔甲或带着盾牌的怪物有一个考虑到其盔甲、盾牌和灵巧性的护甲等级（AC）。否则，怪物的护甲等级是基于它的灵巧修正值和自然护甲（如果有的话）。如果一个怪物有天然护甲，穿戴护甲，或携带盾牌，这将在其AC值后面的括号中注明。",
	"A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the {@i Player's Handbook.}": "当一个怪物的命中率下降到0时，它通常会死亡或被消灭。更多关于命中率的信息，请参见{@i Player's Handbook.}。",

	"Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.": "有些生物具有以下一种或多种额外的运动模式。",

	"A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn't need to spend extra movement to climb.": "拥有攀爬速度的怪物可以使用其全部或部分移动来在垂直表面上移动。该怪物不需要花费额外的移动来攀爬。",
	"A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to hover, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in the {@i Player's Handbook}).

	"The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls.
