	"The Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. Like games of make-believe, D&D is driven by imagination.

	"The D&D game consists of a group of characters (controlled by the players) embarking on an adventure that the DM presents. The adventure is the heart of the game. An adventure unfolds as a story that the DM and the other players tell together using the material in the adventure book, in another published adventure, or in a setting of the DM's creation. The DM sets the scene at the start, giving the adventurers a reason to get involved. They are the protagonists of the story.

The players don't need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.": "有时，一个玩家代表整个团队发言，例如说：\"我们要走东门\"。其他时候，不同的冒险者做不同的事情。一个冒险者可能会搜索一个宝箱，而第二个冒险者则检查刻在墙上的深奥符号，第三个冒险者则负责监视怪物。玩家不需要轮流做，但是DM会倾听每个玩家的意见，并决定如何解决这些行动。",

You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.": "你可以{@b drop {@condition prone}}而不使用任何你的速度。(1%)需要更多的努力；这样做要花费相当于你速度一半的移动量。例如，如果你的速度是30英尺，你必须花费15英尺的动作才能站起来。如果你没有足够的移动量或你的速度为0，你就不能站起来。",
	"To move while {@condition prone}, you must {@b crawl} or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot.

	"When you take the {@action Dodge} action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage.

	"A spell must have a casting time of 1 action to be readied, and holding onto the spell's magic until you release it with your reaction requires concentration (explained in {@book chapter 4|RMR|3}).

	"You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack.
