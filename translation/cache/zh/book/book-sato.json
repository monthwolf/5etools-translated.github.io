	"The multiverse is everything known and everything beyond. Encompassing worlds planes, life, and death, the multiverse's infinite infinities brim with wonder, terror, secrets, and—above all—possibility. Every D&D adventure takes place in the multiverse. Beyond the lone worlds of the Material Plane are countless other realities and the paths and portals that connect every edge of eternity. Those who seek the wonders of the planes take their first step into the endless possibilities of a Planescape campaign.": "多元宇宙是所有已知和超越一切的存在。包括世界、位面、生命和死亡，多元宇宙的无限无穷充满着奇迹、恐惧、秘密，最重要的是——可能性。每一场D&D冒险都发生在多元宇宙中。超越物质位面孤立世界的是无数其他现实，以及连接永恒边缘的各种路径和传送门。那些追寻位面奇观的人踏出了通往无尽可能性的《(Planescape)》冒险的第一步。",
	"Planescape is the D&D multiverse and so much more. Beyond the {@book Great Wheel cosmology|DMG|2|The Great Wheel} (detailed in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}), Planescape focuses on reality-bending adventures and aesthetics unbound from those of mortal worlds. Just as other D&D settings highlight certain concepts but can host any genre of adventure or style of play, the same is true of Planescape. Adventures in Planescape campaigns often focus on the following themes:": "Planescape是D&D多元宇宙，不仅如此。超越{@book Great Wheel cosmology|DMG|2|The Great Wheel}（在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中详细描述），Planescape专注于颠覆现实的冒险和美学，超越凡俗世界的束缚。就像其他D&D设定突出某些概念但可以容纳任何冒险类型或游戏风格一样，Planescape也是如此。在Planescape战役中的冒险经常聚焦于以下主题：",
	"Planescape adventures provide glimpses of the daily lives of unfathomable beings—like gods, angels, and demons—and how they act (and interact) when mortals aren't their primary concern. The mysteries of life and the afterlife are widely known to these creatures.": "《(Planescape)》冒险提供了神神秘秘的生活的一瞥，比如神神、天使和恶魔，以及当凡人不是他们主要关注的对象时，他们是如何行动（和互动）的。这些生物广泛了解生命和来世的奥秘。",
	"Planescape adventures span worlds, planes, and possibilities. Travel between incredible realms is common, especially via portal-rich locales like Sigil and the Outlands (detailed in this book). Adventurers are likely to see multiple impossible sights every day.": "计划位面的冒险跨越世界、位面和可能性。在令人难以置信的领域之间旅行很常见，特别是通过像锡基尔和外地（在这本书中详细描述）这样富有传送门的地点。冒险者可能每天都会看到多个不可能的景象。",
	"In Planescape adventures, dangers might threaten countless worlds, or the fate of the multiverse might hang in the balance. By the same token, wonders are commonplace, and true marvels are often wild in the extreme.": "在《(Planescape)》冒险中，危险可能威胁无数个世界，或者整个多元宇宙的命运可能悬在一线。同样地，奇迹是司空见惯的，真正的奇迹往往极其狂野。",
	"The multiverse makes room for everything, and beliefs manifest as fantastic creatures. Planescape adventures often pit philosophies against one another and highlight subjective views. Situations might encourage characters to reexamine their beliefs in the face of plane-spanning philosophies, conflicts, and revelations.": "多元宇宙为一切留有空间，信念化为奇幻生物。《(Planescape)》冒险经常将哲学对立并突显主观观点。情境可能鼓励角色在跨越位面的哲学、冲突和启示面前重新审视他们的信念。",
	"The planes are home to beings of phenomenal power, yet the smallest things make a difference. Although adventurers might seem insignificant in the grand scheme of the multiverse, their choices hold the power to change reality.": "各个位面都是拥有非凡力量的存在之家，然而最微小的事物也能产生影响。尽管冒险者在多元宇宙的宏伟计划中看起来微不足道，但他们的选择却拥有改变现实的力量。",

Characters might encounter D&D's greatest characters and monsters in situations where they're not pitted against one another.": "{@b Everything D&D}. 在任何D&D设定中，你能想象到的任何东西都可能出现在《位面漫游者》的冒险中。角色可能会在不互相对抗的情况下遇到D&D中最伟大的角色和怪物。",

	"Infinite possibility doesn't mean infinite complexity. The residents of Sigil and planar travelers know the multiverse follows three basic principles. Reality's vast complexity and the limits of individual perspective might obscure these principles, but those with the time and patience to learn from the multiverse's cycles eventually realize these truths.": "无限的可能性并不意味着无限的复杂性。锡基尔(`Sigil`)的居民和平面旅行者知道，多元宇宙遵循三个基本原则。现实的巨大复杂性和个人视角的局限可能会掩盖这些原则，但那些有时间和耐心从多元宇宙的循环中学习的人最终会意识到这些真理。",
	"What's at the center of the multiverse? Nothing—and everything.": "多元宇宙的中心是什么？什么也没有——又是一切。",
	"The multiverse is an infinite expanse, and nothing can literally be at the center of infinity. Nevertheless, countless worlds, faiths, and narcissists consider themselves the center of everything. They're correct, in a sense: wherever you stand is the most important place in existence—at least, for you.": "多元宇宙是一个无限广阔的空间，没有什么东西可以真正处于无限的中心。然而，无数的世界、信仰和自恋者都认为自己是万物的中心。在某种意义上，他们是正确的：无论你站在哪里，那个地方对你来说都是存在最重要的地方。",
	"Systems, cycles, orbits, planes, lives, even the city of Sigil itself—the multiverse is composed of infinite rings. Whether these are physical or philosophical rings, the elements of the multiverse have no beginning or end, and if you follow any for long enough, you'll return to where you started.": "系统，循环，轨道，平面，生命，甚至西格尔城（Sigil）本身——多元宇宙由无限环组成。无论这些是物理的还是哲学的环，多元宇宙的元素都没有起点或终点，如果你沿着任何一个走得足够久，你会回到起点。",

	"Divination": "占卜 (Divination)",
	"Sorcerer, warlock, wizard": "术士 (Sorcerer), 术士 (Warlock), 巫师 (Wizard)",

	"This section describes magic items likely to be found in Sigil and the Outlands.": "这部分描述了在锡基尔(`Sigil`)和外域(`the Outlands`)可能发现的魔法物品。",
	"Sigil is the crossroads of the multiverse, a city at the center of the Great Wheel. Connected to every plane of existence and the infinite worlds among them, the City of Doors brims with commerce, travel, schemes, and adventure. Sigil is commonly referred to as the Cage because the only way into or out of the city is through one of its countless portals—pathways controlled by the enigmatic Lady of Pain.": "盖西尔是多元宇宙的十字路口，是巨轮的中心城市。与存在的每个位面和其中无尽的世界相连，这座门之城充满了商业、旅行、阴谋和冒险。盖西尔通常被称为笼子，因为进入或离开这座城市的唯一方式是通过其无数的传送门之一——这些通道由神秘的痛苦女士控制。",
	"Sigil simultaneously exists at the center of the Great Wheel and nowhere. In the middle of the Outlands, an impossibly tall needle of a mountain, the Spire, rises into the sky. Sigil floats above the apex of the Spire, barely visible from the ground, constructed on the inside of a massive stone torus. Attempts to ascend to the city by climbing or flight are futile, as are efforts to reach the top of the Spire.": "锡基尔同时存在于大轮之中，又似乎不存在于任何地方。在外域的中心，一座高不可攀的山峰——尖塔，耸立入云。锡基尔漂浮在尖塔的顶端，从地面上几乎看不见，建造在一个巨大的石环内部。试图攀登或飞越到城市的努力是徒劳的，同样徒劳的还有到达尖塔顶端的努力。",
	"Once inside the city, a visitor is greeted by a vast urban tangle of bladed buildings in a wild array of architectural styles. Built within a great ring, the city curves before and behind observers, as if they stood in a bowl or valley, stretching upward and disappearing into an industrial haze. On a clear day, a creature that looks upward sees the other side of the city, curving far overhead. Visitors can find this reality unsettling. There are no suns, moons, stars, or other celestial bodies in the sky above Sigil, though city lights twinkle above in the darkest hours.": "一旦进入这座城市，游客会被一片庞大的城市建筑群所迎接，这些建筑以各种狂野的建筑风格错落有致。这座城市建在一个巨大的环形结构内，城市在观察者前后弯曲，就像他们站在一个碗或山谷中，向上延伸并消失在工业烟雾中。在晴朗的日子里，抬头看的生物会看到城市的另一侧，远远地弯曲在头顶上方。游客可能会觉得这个现实令人不安。在锡基尔(Sigil)上空，没有太阳、月亮、星星或其他天体，尽管在最黑暗的时刻，城市灯光在头顶闪烁。",
	"Sigil is built to the edges of the ring, forming a wall of structures along its border. Anyone who climbs atop this outer wall of buildings can look out over the edge into an empty sky. Few who cross the edge are ever heard from again. Those who pass over the edge don't end up in the Outlands; rather, they are flung to random corners of the planes.": "锡基尔（Sigil）建造在环形边缘，形成了沿着边界的建筑墙。任何爬上这些外部建筑墙的人都可以往外看，看到一片空无的天空。很少有人越过边缘后再被听到。那些越过边缘的人并不会到达外域（Outlands）；相反，他们会被投射到不同的位面角落。",
	"Included with this product is a {@book poster map of Sigil|SatO|2}. The city's ever-changing nature and its myriad portals render concepts like distance, size, and travel time irrelevant. How long it takes to get from point to point in Sigil is up to the DM. Prominent sites of interest are noted on the map, but countless other locations fill the city's ever-shifting streets, which the DM can detail.": "本产品附带一个{@book poster map of Sigil|SatO|2}。这座城市不断变化的本质和其无数的传送门使得距离、大小和旅行时间等概念变得无关紧要。在锡基尔（Sigil）中从一个地点到另一个地点需要多长时间完全取决于DM。地图上标有一些重要景点，但城市不断变化的街道上还有无数其他地点，DM可以进行详细描述。",
	"Sigil has the following features:": "西格尔有以下功能：",
	"Sigil observes a 24-hour day-night cycle. The sky gradually fills with luminescence during the day and fades into deep darkness at night. This light isn't sunlight. Sigil's brightest and darkest points in time are known as peak and antipeak.": "锡基尔（Sigil）遵循着一个24小时的昼夜循环。白天，天空逐渐充满发光，夜晚则渐渐变暗。这种光并非阳光。锡基尔最明亮和最黑暗的时刻被称为顶峰（peak）和反顶峰（antipeak）。",
	"Objects are pulled toward whichever section of the city's ground is closest.": "物体被拉向城市地面最近的部分。",
	"Fog, smog, and drizzle—the most weather variation Sigil sees—gather at ground level and limit visibility to {@dice 1d6 × 50} feet on the murkiest of days. The temperature varies between balmy and chilly year-round and rarely nears extremes.": "在西格尔（Sigil）最常见的天气变化是雾、烟雾和毛毛雨，它们聚集在地面并在最阴暗的日子里将能见度限制在{@dice 1d6 × 50}英尺。全年气温在温暖和寒冷之间变化，很少接近极端。",
	"Planar magic works differently in Sigil. The following magical restrictions apply there:": "在锡基尔（Sigil）中，位面魔法运作方式不同。以下魔法限制适用于那里：",
	"Effects that banish a target from Sigil treat the target as if Sigil were its home plane.": "将目标从 (Sigil) 放逐的效果视为目标将 (Sigil) 作为其本位面。",
	"Extradimensional spaces, demiplanes, and pocket dimensions—such as those created by a {@item bag of holding} or the {@spell rope trick} spell—function within Sigil, but those spaces follow all these restrictions as if they were part of the city.": "超维空间、半位面和口袋维度——比如由{@item bag of holding}或{@spell rope trick}法术创造的那些——在希基尔内运作，但这些空间遵循所有这些限制，就好像它们是城市的一部分一样。",
	"Effects that allow interplanar travel, such as {@spell astral projection} or {@spell plane shift}, fail if used to try to enter or leave Sigil, with one exception (see the \"Teleportation Circles\" section below).": "如果使用诸如{@spell astral projection}或{@spell plane shift}之类的允许跨平面旅行的效果试图进入或离开锡基尔，将会失败，但有一个例外（请参阅下面的“传送阵”部分）。",
	"Spells, magic items, and effects that summon creatures or objects from other planes, such as a {@item ring of djinni summoning}, instead summon targets from within Sigil if possible or otherwise fail. Effects that summon a specific target from outside Sigil, as with a {@spell Leomund's secret chest} spell, fail automatically.": "召唤生物或物体的法术、魔法物品和效果，比如{@item ring of djinni summoning}，如果可能的话会从锡基尔内部召唤目标，否则会失败。从锡基尔外部召唤特定目标的效果，比如{@spell Leomund's secret chest}法术，会自动失败。",
	"Attempts to teleport into or out of Sigil fail, but such magic functions normally when used to teleport within the city.": "尝试传送进入或离开锡基尔失败，但在城市内部使用传送魔法时，该类魔法会正常运作。",
	"Permanent teleportation circles exist within Sigil, but attempts to create new ones fail. Those with permission can use them to enter the city via the {@spell plane shift} spell but not to leave.": "在锡基尔（Sigil）内存在着永久传送法阵，但尝试创建新的法阵会失败。获得许可的人可以使用这些法阵通过{@spell plane shift}法术进入这座城市，但无法离开。",
	"Summoning in the Cage": "召唤在牢笼中 (`Summoning in the Cage`)",
	"With the exception of permanent teleportation circles, the Lady of Pain prevents spells and other powers from allowing anything to enter the City of Doors. That means creatures and objects from outside in the multiverse can't be summoned or conjured into Sigil by any means. Summoning abilities a character might have, such as the {@spell conjure elemental} spell or a class feature that summons a companion, still function as normal with these features calling only creatures that exist somewhere within Sigil itself.": "除了永久传送法阵外，(Lady of Pain) 阻止法术和其他力量让任何东西进入《(City of Doors)》。这意味着来自多元宇宙外的生物和物体无法通过任何方式被召唤或聚集到锡基尔。角色可能拥有的召唤能力，比如{@spell conjure elemental}法术或召唤同伴的职业特性，仍然按正常方式运作，但这些能力只能召唤锡基尔内某处存在的生物。",
	"The unique planar geography of Sigil should create interesting, even if sometimes confounding, twists, but it shouldn't prevent a character from doing what they do best.": "锡基尔（Sigil）独特的平面地理应该会带来有趣的，即使有时令人困惑的转折，但不应阻止角色发挥他们的所长。",
	"Creatures from every corner of the planes live and toil in the City of Doors, bringing fragments of their cultures to the multiversal hub. Over eons, these cultural tenets have blended and evolved into a unique way of life made possible by the myriad portals that exist at the Lady of Pain's sufferance.": "来自各个位面的生物在(Doors之城)生活和劳作，将他们文化的碎片带到这个多元宇宙枢纽。经过亿万年的时间，这些文化准则融合并演变成一种独特的生活方式，这得益于存在于(痛苦女士)宽容之下的众多传送门。",
	"Sigil is the backstage of the multiverse. Celestials and Fiends share drinks in genie-owned taverns, agents of evil gods trot through the streets astride {@creature Nightmare||nightmares}, and hags stable faerie steeds alongside {@creature Pegasus||pegasi} and beasts of living stone. As a result of this mingling, fundamentally incompatible parts of the multiverse come into direct contact. They don't always clash, but when they do, authorities maintain order and stifle cosmic peril. Only when these eruptions threaten the city on a grand scale does the Lady of Pain intervene.": "符文是多元宇宙的后台。天界生灵和邪恶生物在由精灵拥有的酒馆里共饮，邪神的使者骑着{@creature Nightmare||nightmares}穿行于街道，女巫们在{@creature Pegasus||pegasi}和由活石制成的野兽旁边安放仙灵坐骑。由于这种交融，多元宇宙中根本不相容的部分直接接触。它们并不总是冲突，但一旦发生，当局会维持秩序并遏制宇宙危险。只有当这些喷发威胁到城市的大规模时，痛苦女士才会介入。",
	"Humans are the earliest known inhabitants of the City of Doors. Some sages track the existence and spread of humans back to Sigil itself, rather than to a deity or its creations.": "人类是“门之城”中已知的最早居民。一些智者追溯人类的存在和传播到达锡基尔本身，而不是归因于某位神祇或其创造物。",
	"Various factions handle the day-to-day governance of Sigil, enforcement of laws, and maintenance of civic infrastructure. These groups each follow a philosophy inspired by a cosmic aspect of the multiverse, and they actively recruit visitors and citizens into their ranks.": "各个派别负责辛吉尔的日常治理、执法和市政基础设施的维护。这些团体每个都遵循宇宙多元宇宙的某个方面所启发的哲学，并积极招募游客和市民加入他们的行列。",
	"Gods and godlike figures—including archdevils and demon lords—can't enter Sigil by any means. However, their schemes and influence still find their way into the city through their agents.": "神灵和类似神明的存在——包括大领主和恶魔领主——无论如何都无法进入锡基尔。然而，它们的阴谋和影响仍然通过它们的代理人进入这座城市。",
	"Neither port nor proximity dictates trade in the City of Doors, granting its merchants and artisans access to the planes and their wondrous offerings. Woodcarvers whittle toys from golden trees toppled in Arborea, blacksmiths forge weapons from infernal ingots, and tavern chefs cook halfling recipes passed down on worlds of the Material Plane. With enough time, connections, and coin, one can find anything in Sigil's markets.": "在门户之城，贸易不受港口或接近程度的限制，这使得该城的商人和工匠能够接触到各个位面及其奇妙的商品。木匠们从阿波瑞亚倒下的金色树木上雕刻玩具，铁匠们用地狱铁锭锻造武器，酒馆厨师烹饪着半身人菜谱，这些菜谱是从物质位面的世界上传承下来的。只要有足够的时间、人脉和金币，在西格尔的市场上什么都能找到。",
	"A dizzying array of coinage flows through Sigil. It doesn't matter where a coin was minted—if it's made of precious metal and the weight is right, the money is usually good. However, some traders are particular about the currencies they accept. An {@creature efreeti} merchant selling instruments from the City of Brass might accept only rainbow sapphires from the Elemental Plane of Earth. Perhaps a {@creature night hag} hawking rare spell components refuses all currency but fresh {@creature Larva|DMG|larvae} from Hades, while a {@creature bone devil} might siphon years off the buyer's life as payment for a diabolical blade.": "在西格尔（Sigil）流通着多种繁杂的货币。无论一枚硬币是在哪里铸造的，只要是由贵重金属制成且重量合适，这笔钱通常都是有效的。然而，一些交易者对他们接受的货币很挑剔。一个来自铜城（City of Brass）出售乐器的商人可能只接受来自地球元素位面的彩虹蓝宝石。也许一个贩卖稀有咒语材料的{@creature night hag}拒绝除来自哈迪斯（Hades）的新鲜{@creature Larva|DMG|larvae}之外的任何货币，而一个{@creature bone devil}可能会以买家生命中的岁月作为支付恶魔之刃的代价。",
	"Buyers can find goods of every shape, size, and sort in one of Sigil's many marketplaces, the largest of which is the Great Bazaar (see the \"{@book Market Ward|SatO|2|Market Ward}\" section later in this chapter), though individual businesses lie scattered among the wards.": "在锡基尔的众多市场之一，即最大的大巴扎（见本章后面的“{@book Market Ward|SatO|2|Market Ward}”部分），买家可以找到各种形状、大小和种类的商品，尽管个别企业分散在各区之间。",
	"Any and every service is for sale in the Cage. Courier services staffed by mephits, imps, and {@creature Lantern Archon|MPP|lantern archons} (see {@book Morte's Planar Parade|MPP}) carry messages across planar boundaries. Brave exterminators rid buildings of cranium rats, curses, and dangerous afflictions. Clandestine agencies offer escape from infernal debt collectors or other looming perils by killing their clients, keeping the bodies safe and preserved, and resurrecting them when trouble has died down, sometimes years or decades later.": "在铁笼中，任何服务都可以买到。由小恶魔、小妖和{@creature Lantern Archon|MPP|lantern archons}（见{@book Morte's Planar Parade|MPP}）组成的快递服务人员跨越位面边界传递消息。勇敢的灭鼠者清除建筑物中的头骨鼠、诅咒和危险疾病。秘密机构提供逃离地狱债务收取者或其他潜在危险的服务，他们通过杀死客户、保护和保存尸体，并在麻烦消失后（有时是数年甚至数十年后）将他们复活。",
	"Travelers from across the multiverse flood the city, whose establishments cater to a diverse clientele. Taverns and inns are common, their taprooms shaped by the fantastical folk who own them—angels, githzerai, and a host of friendly monsters who scrape by in the City of Doors. No matter where a visitor is from, they can find familiar comforts in Sigil.": "跨越多元宇宙的旅行者涌入这座城市，这里的各种场所迎合着多样化的客户。酒馆和客栈很常见，它们的酒吧由拥有它们的奇幻种族塑造——天使、(githzerai)，以及在“门之城”勉力维持生计的一群友善的怪物。无论访客来自何方，他们都可以在锡基尔找到熟悉的舒适。",
	"Knowing where to look for something one needs is made challenging by Sigil's prodigious sprawl. Without the aid of magic or in-depth knowledge of portals within the city and their destinations, navigating the Cage is a dizzying affair.": "在西格尔（Sigil）庞大的城市中寻找所需之物的位置是一项具有挑战性的任务。如果没有魔法的帮助或对城市内传送门及其目的地的深入了解，穿越这个笼子（the Cage）将是一个令人眩晕的事务。",
	"Fortunately, two services exist throughout Sigil to help travelers find their way: sedan chairs and touts. Visitors to the Clerks' Ward can also hire the cabs of {@book Tea Street Transit|SatO|2|Tea Street Transit} (see the \"{@book Clerks' Ward|SatO|2|Clerks' Ward}\" section).": "幸运的是，在西格尔到处都有两种服务，可以帮助旅行者找到他们的路：轿子和拉客。到书记区的游客也可以雇佣{@book Tea Street Transit|SatO|2|Tea Street Transit}的出租车（见\"{@book Clerks' Ward|SatO|2|Clerks' Ward}\"部分）。",
	"Sedan chairs are comfortable chairs carried by burly types, Humanoid or otherwise. Sedan chairs act as a citywide taxi service, lingering near civic buildings, municipal hubs, and marketplaces.": "轿车是由强壮的人类或其他生物扛着的舒适椅子。轿车充当着城市范围内的出租车服务，常停留在市政建筑、市政中心和市场附近。",
	"A typical sedan chair ride costs 1 sp per passenger and can carry two Medium or smaller creatures to a destination in Sigil, but there are some places they simply won't go—like {@book Undersigil|SatO|2|Undersigil} or unsafe parts of the {@book Hive Ward|SatO|2|Hive Ward}. Heavier chairs that ferry larger customers or groups exist, carried by brawny creatures such as {@creature Ogre||ogres} or {@creature Umber Hulk||umber hulks}. These deluxe chairs cost more, a minimum of 1 gp per passenger, and those who carry them might be willing to travel to dangerous areas of the city for an extra fee.": "一次典型的轿车椅乘坐费用为每位乘客 1 sp，可以搭载两个中型或更小的生物前往希格尔（Sigil）的目的地，但有些地方他们根本不会去——比如{@book Undersigil|SatO|2|Undersigil}或者{@book Hive Ward|SatO|2|Hive Ward}的危险地带。还有一些更重的轿车，可以搭载更大的顾客或团体，由强壮的生物如{@creature Ogre||ogres}或{@creature Umber Hulk||umber hulks}来承担。这些豪华轿车的费用更高，每位乘客至少 1 gp，而搬运它们的人可能愿意为额外费用前往城市的危险区域。",

	"As people and beings from everywhere find their way to Sigil, every conceivable language comes with them. Common is the most frequently spoken language. The fact that Common-speaking travelers from different worlds can meet in Sigil and understand one another perplexes linguists and suggests that the language originated in Sigil. Creatures native to Sigil are typically fluent in Common and one other language.": "随着来自各地的人类和生物找到通往锡基尔（Sigil）的途径，各种各样的语言也随之而来。普通语（Common）是最常用的语言。来自不同世界的说普通语的旅行者可以在锡基尔相遇并相互理解，这让语言学家感到困惑，并暗示这种语言起源于锡基尔。锡基尔的本地生物通常能流利地说普通语和另一种语言。",

	"Farming in Sigil is virtually nonexistent due to the scarcity of arable land. Outside of private gardens and the occasional community plot, the only plant that flourishes in the City of Doors is razorvine, a prickly hazard native to the Lower Planes. This black, creeping ivy has broad, glossy leaves with razor-sharp stems and thorns. Work crews fight the rapidly growing weed from overrunning the city. Others use razorvine strategically to deter intruders by letting it grow along estate walls or as carefully cultivated hedges. Rules for {@book razorvine|DMG|5|Razorvine} can be found in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}.": "在西格尔（Sigil）种植业几乎不存在，因为耕地稀缺。除了私人花园和偶尔的社区种植区外，在“门之城”（City of Doors）唯一茂盛的植物是剃刀藤（razorvine），这是一种源自下位平面的多刺危险植物。这种黑色的蔓延常春藤有宽大、光滑的叶子，带有锋利的茎和刺。工作人员努力防止这种快速生长的杂草占领整座城市。其他人则策略性地利用剃刀藤来阻挡入侵者，让其沿着庄园墙壁生长，或者作为精心修剪的树篱。有关{@book razorvine|DMG|5|Razorvine}的规则可在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中找到。",

	"Most portals aren't always open. Instead, they open at certain times, when a particular condition is met, in response to a command word or phrase, or when a traveler is holding a particular object called a portal key.

	"Portals are usually invisible when they're inactive (including to {@spell detect magic} spells), but they can be detected by the {@spell true seeing} or {@spell warp sense|SatO} spell (see {@book chapter 1|SatO|1|Warp Sense} of this book for a description of the latter). When a portal activates, it typically becomes outlined in light with its destination visible beyond.": "传送门通常在不活跃时是看不见的（包括对{@spell detect magic}法术），但可以被{@spell true seeing}或{@spell warp sense|SatO}法术探测到（有关后者的描述请参见本书的{@book chapter 1|SatO|1|Warp Sense}）。当一个传送门激活时，通常会被光线勾勒出轮廓，其目的地也会在远处可见。",
	"A portal key can be any sort of object or a particular key created for that portal. Keys often bear some symbolic connection to their destination, such as a silver sphere for the Astral Plane, a length of chain for Carceri, or a white lily for Elysium. The key functions on either side of a portal, be it in Sigil or its destination.": "传送门钥匙可以是任何类型的物体，或者是专门为该传送门创建的钥匙。这些钥匙通常与它们的目的地有一些象征性的联系，比如银色球体代表星界(Astral Plane)，一截链子代表卡塞里(Carceri)，或者一朵白百合代表恩里斯(Elysium)。这些钥匙在传送门的两侧都能发挥作用，无论是在锡基尔(Sigil)还是目的地。",
	"Far rarer are portal keys that aren't objects. These can be simple or strange: a type of creature, a memory in the traveler's mind, or a whistled tune.": "更为罕见的是不是物体的传送钥匙。这些可以是简单的或奇怪的：一种生物，旅行者心中的记忆，或者一个吹口哨的曲调。",
	"Some portals have strange magical quirks. If you want to dress up a standard portal, roll on the Portal Quirks table or choose from its examples.": "一些传送门具有奇怪的魔法特性。如果你想要装饰一个标准传送门，可以在传送门特性表上投骰子，或者从示例中选择一个。",
	"One-Way. The portal functions only one way, either into or out of Sigil. The portal isn't visible or detectable from the exit side.": "单向传送门。传送门只能单向运作，要么是进入锡基尔，要么是离开锡基尔。传送门在出口一侧是看不见或探测不到的。",
	"Shifting. One end of the portal moves in a pattern between different locations in Sigil or the destination plane.": "转移。传送门的一端以某种模式在锡基尔或目的地平面的不同位置之间移动。",

	"Taxing. The portal's energy is unstable. A creature that passes through the portal must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of {@condition exhaustion}.": "税收。传送门的能量不稳定。通过传送门的生物必须成功通过一次 DC 10 的体质豁免才能避免获得 1 级 {@condition exhaustion}。",
	"Temporary. The portal allows only {@dice 1d6 + 6} travelers to pass through in either direction, then vanishes.": "临时。传送门只允许{@dice 1d6 + 6}名旅行者双向通过，然后消失。",
	"Tumbling Lock. Every time the portal is opened, it requires a different portal key.": "翻滚锁。每次打开传送门时，都需要不同的传送门钥匙。",

	"The greatest entity in Sigil is the Lady of Pain, an eternal being who watches over the Cage. She appears almost human, although she most definitely isn't. She wears ornate robes that shroud her body, and a mantle of blades coated in blue-green verdigris surrounds her masklike face. No one is certain who or what exactly the Lady of Pain is, but it's widely accepted she's a being on par with deities. Strong enough to bar gods and their ilk from entering her city, the Lady of Pain forbids followers of her own. To worship her is more than taboo; it is an unforgivable crime punishable by imprisonment in the Mazes.": "锡基尔(Sigil)中最伟大的存在是痛苦女士(Lady of Pain)，她是一个永恒的存在，守护着笼子(Cage)。她看起来几乎像人类，尽管她绝对不是。她穿着华丽的长袍遮盖着身体，头戴一顶被蓝绿铜锈覆盖的刀刃披风。没有人确切知道痛苦女士是谁或者是什么，但普遍认为她与神明相当。痛苦女士足够强大，可以阻止神灵及其同类进入她的城市，她禁止追随者。崇拜她不仅是禁忌；而且是一种不可饶恕的罪行，将受到在迷宫(Mazes)中监禁的惩罚。",
	"The Lady maintains the cosmic neutrality of Sigil. The city doesn't take part in the Blood War, it doesn't throw its weight behind the shining righteousness of Mount Celestia or contracts originating in the Nine Hells, and it's never a battleground for the conflicts of Material Plane worlds.": "女士维护着锡基尔的宇宙中立性。这座城市不参与血战，不支持圣洁的耶天堂山，也不与来自九层地狱的契约有牵连，它从不成为物质位面世界冲突的战场。",
	"On rare occasions, the Lady of Pain drifts through the streets, hovering above the ground. Creatures that interfere with her are flayed by her stare or vanish into nothingness as she turns to face them. Wise travelers give the Lady a wide berth, finding pressing business elsewhere as she passes by. Some locals claim that the Lady's features occasionally take on a golden or steely sheen. Whether this is in response to threats to her city or other influences is a mystery.": "在罕见的情况下，(Lady of Pain) 漂浮在街道上空。那些干扰她的生物会被她的凝视剥皮，或者在她转身面对他们时消失得无影无踪。明智的旅行者会远离(Lady)，在她经过时找到其他紧急的事务。一些当地人声称(Lady) 的特征有时会呈现出金色或钢铁般的光泽。这究竟是对她的城市的威胁还是其他影响的回应，仍然是一个谜。",
	"Residents of Sigil view the Lady of Pain with fearful awe. A distant guardian, she leaves the city's daily governance to the many factions that call it home. She has no residence, and no temples to her exist within the city.": "锡基尔（Sigil）的居民以敬畏的心情看待疼痛女士（Lady of Pain）。作为遥远的守护者，她将城市的日常治理交给了众多在此定居的派系。她没有固定住所，在城市内也没有供奉她的寺庙。",
	"The Lady's means of protecting Sigil are the dabus, the Mazes, and her complete control over the city's portals.": "女士保护锡基尔的手段是达布斯(dabus)、迷宫(Mazes)和她对城市传送门的完全控制。",
	"Dabus are silent, floating beings who serve the Lady of Pain. Found only in Sigil, dabus communicate through visual rebuses, conjured illusory images that convey their thoughts.": "达布斯是无声的，漂浮的生物，为痛苦女士服务。只在锡基尔发现，达布斯通过视觉谜语进行沟通，召唤幻象图像来传达他们的思想。",
	"Dabus maintain Sigil's infrastructure, repairing crumbling buildings, ensuring portals function properly, cutting back rampant razorvine, and patching city streets. To most citizens of Sigil, dabus are nothing more than cryptic workers, yet these mysterious beings also punish those who disrupt city life. Whatever opposes the Lady's edicts or the smooth functioning of Sigil, dabus work to correct.": "达布斯(Dabus)负责维护锡基尔(Sigil)的基础设施，修复破损的建筑，确保传送门正常运作，修剪疯长的剃刀藤，修补城市街道。对于大多数锡基尔的市民来说，达布斯只是神秘的工人，然而这些神秘的存在也惩罚那些扰乱城市生活的人。无论是违背女士的法令还是干扰锡基尔顺畅运转的事物，达布斯都会努力纠正。",

	"The Mazes are demiplanar cages created by the Lady of Pain. Reserved for would-be power mongers and dissidents who threaten the city on a grand scale—or foolishly target the Lady herself—the Mazes swallow their prisoners in an instant. The Mazes resemble a dense labyrinth of empty streets and alleys in Sigil but are devoid of life and repeat endlessly.": "迷宫是由痛苦女士创造的半位面笼子。专门用来关押那些企图谋权和威胁城市秩序的人，或者愚蠢地瞄准痛苦女士本人的人。迷宫会在瞬间吞噬囚犯。迷宫看起来像锡基尔中一片密集的空街道和小巷的迷宫，但却没有生命，无尽地重复着。",
	"No magic allows a creature banished to the Mazes to escape or communicate with the planes beyond. Creatures in the Mazes don't require food, drink, or sleep and are cursed to an indefinite, isolated existence. An urban legend states the Lady of Pain leaves a single portal in every Maze, but finding the escape route is all but impossible for the imprisoned, as even if such portals exist, they can't be detected through magical means. The few who claim to have escaped the Mazes are quickly branded as liars.": "没有魔法可以让被放逐到迷宫的生物逃脱或与远方的位面进行交流。迷宫中的生物不需要食物、饮水或睡眠，并被诅咒陷入无限孤立的存在。一个都市传说称痛苦女士在每个迷宫中留下一个传送门，但对于被囚禁者来说，找到逃生路线几乎是不可能的，因为即使这样的传送门存在，也无法通过魔法手段检测到。声称逃出迷宫的少数人很快就会被贴上说谎者的标签。",
	"Sigil's portals operate at the Lady of Pain's will, as do the few permanent teleportation circles hidden among the city's wards. Her influence stops spells and other features from allowing creatures to enter or leave the city. She even bars gods from stepping foot in the city—a ban she can extend to anyone at any time. The Lady knows when any creature uses a portal and can block that creature from entering or leaving, but she reserves this intervention for extreme circumstances.": "锡基尔（Sigil）的传送门由痛苦女士（Lady of Pain）的意志控制，城市中隐藏的少数永久传送法阵也是如此。她的影响阻止了法术和其他功能使生物进入或离开城市。她甚至禁止神灵踏入城市——这一禁令她可以随时对任何人施加。女士知道任何生物使用传送门的情况，并可以阻止该生物进入或离开，但她只在极端情况下才会采取这种干预。",
	"During times of great strife, notably when Sigil's factions war openly against one another, the Lady can cause all the city's portals to cease functioning. This grinds the city to a halt; food and drink can't enter the city, sewage and refuse pool in the streets, and corpses stack in the Mortuary with no hope of being interred. This compels the factions to quickly resolve their conflicts.": "在严重动荡时期，特别是当锡基尔的派系公开对抗时，女士可以让城市所有的传送门停止运作。这使城市陷入瘫痪；食物和饮料无法进入城市，污水和垃圾在街道上积聚，尸体在(mortuary)中堆积，无法安葬的希望。这迫使各派系迅速解决他们的冲突。",
	"The Lady of Pain is omnipresent, unknowable, and invincible. With a look, she can flense troublesome creatures to within an inch of their lives. Any creature that targets her with an attack, a spell, or any other hostile or prying effect—in some cases so much as speaking to her—is assailed by overwhelming pain and immediately drops to 1 hit point. If the creature hasn't learned its lesson, the Lady sends it to the Mazes in the next blink.": "痛苦女士(Lady of Pain)无所不在，神秘莫测，无敌之身。她只需一瞥，便能将令人讨厌的生物剥皮至濒临死亡。任何试图以攻击、法术或其他敌意或窥探性效果瞄准她的生物——有时甚至只是与她交谈——都会遭受势不可挡的痛苦，立刻降至1点生命值。如果生物还没吸取教训，女士会在下一个眨眼间将其送往迷宫(Mazes)。",
	"Similar to other godlike beings, the Lady of Pain has no stat block. She is beyond the ability of characters to defeat by conventional means.": "与其他类似神明的存在一样，(痛苦女士)没有属性块。她超越了角色们通过常规手段击败的能力。",
	"On the Outer Planes, belief shapes reality. Cosmic concepts such as law and chaos can imbue true believers with newfound power, and when enough creatures unite under one ideology, their beliefs can remold the planes themselves. In Sigil, this power rests with the factions, like-minded philosophers guided by cosmic truths about the multiverse and its workings. Their philosophies are often associated with a plane or realm.": "在外部位面上，信仰塑造现实。宇宙概念，如秩序和混沌，可以赋予真正信徒全新的力量，当足够多的生物团结在一个意识形态下时，他们的信念可以重塑位面本身。在锡基尔，这种力量掌握在派系手中，他们是志同道合的哲学家，受到有关多元宇宙及其运作方式的宇宙真理的指导。他们的哲学思想通常与一个位面或领域相关。",
	"Factions control aspects of civic existence in Sigil, governing the day-to-day needs of a thriving metropolis, such as entertainment or law enforcement. Despite their influence within the city, factions have been erased from the city in the past, and current factions tread carefully to avoid that fate for themselves. They actively recruit new members from citizenry, travelers, and even the ranks of other factions. In the meantime, they vie for power in the Cage in a way that doesn't upset Sigil's order or provoke the Lady of Pain.": "派系控制着锡基尔（Sigil）市民生活的方方面面，管理着这座繁荣大都市的日常需求，比如娱乐或执法。尽管在城市内部有着影响力，派系在过去曾被从城市中抹去，现有的派系小心翼翼地避免自己遭遇同样的命运。他们积极招募来自市民、旅行者，甚至其他派系的新成员。与此同时，他们在锡基尔的笼中争夺权力，但要避免扰乱锡基尔的秩序或激怒痛苦女士（the Lady of Pain）。",
	"Factions are led by individuals known as factols. These leaders embody their groups' philosophies and serve different roles depending on their factions' needs. Factols and their delegates also represent their factions in a council that debates and passes laws in the {@book Hall of Speakers|SatO|2|Hall of Speakers} (see the \"{@book Clerks' Ward|SatO|2|Clerks' Ward}\" section later in this chapter). Most factions also have a physical headquarters in Sigil where they carry out aspects of civic governance. Within these areas, both geographical and influential, dedicated midranking faction members called factotums act as officers, furthering the interests of their factions within the city as clerks, squad leaders, and tutors. Factotums also keep an eye out for promising recruits to their philosophy.": "派系由被称为领袖的人物，即领袖，所领导。这些领袖体现了他们所代表团体的哲学，并根据各自派系的需求担任不同角色。领袖和他们的代表还在一个理事会中代表他们的派系进行辩论和通过法律，这个理事会在{@book Hall of Speakers|SatO|2|Hall of Speakers}（请参见本章后面的“{@book Clerks' Ward|SatO|2|Clerks' Ward}”部分）开会。大多数派系在希格尔都有一个实际总部，他们在那里开展市政治理的各个方面。在这些区域中，无论是地理上还是影响力上，专门的中级派系成员，称为干事，充当官员的角色，进一步推动他们派系的利益，担任文书、小队领袖和导师。干事们还会留意那些有潜力的新成员，以便吸纳他们加入自己的哲学。",

	"Defiers accept that there might be true deities that oversee everything, but such beings are beyond comprehension. They assert that worshipers of the gods draw their power from unknowable sources—false gods simply take the credit.": "蔑视者（Defiers）接受可能存在着监督一切的真神，但这些存在是超出理解的。他们坚称信仰神祗的人从无法知晓的源头获取力量—假神只是在拿走功劳。",

	"Once a thriving college, the Hall of Records was foreclosed on for a slightly overdue debt to the Fated centuries ago. The Fated has since repurposed the building as its headquarters.

	"Unsurprisingly, the underground compound is heavily defended. Within the campus lies a thrumming portal to Ysgard, a plane where might makes right and the Takers hoard their spoils.

	"The voices of Sigil ring out within the Hall of Speakers, where everyday complaints plant the seeds of laws. Formerly the headquarters of the faction known as the Sign of One, the Hall of Speakers is an orrery-like arrangement of rings and domed structures that beckon onlookers to make themselves heard.

	"Public hearings take place within the Speaker's Podium, a spacious chamber named after the wooden lecterns that dominate its stage. Though anyone can spectate, only the Council of Speakers can participate in these debates. Each ascendant faction in Sigil has at least one speaker: typically the factol and one or two other high-ranking members. However, speakers sometimes delegate their time behind the podium to an eloquent representative whom they trust to represent the faction's interests. The debates are largely performative affairs—hour-long bouts where faction representatives embarrass each other and themselves with thinly veiled insults, boasting, and magniloquent rhetoric. The factions of Sigil are rarely in agreement, and the few proposals voted into law by the Council of Speakers are either inconsequential or quickly overturned in favor of the status quo.": "公开听证会在发言者讲台内举行，这是一个宽敞的大厅，以主导舞台的木讲台命名。尽管任何人都可以旁听，但只有发言者理事会的成员可以参与这些辩论。锡基尔的每个主导派别至少有一名发言者：通常是事实派和另外一两名高级成员。然而，发言者有时会将他们的时间委托给一个雄辩的代表，他们信任代表该派别利益。这些辩论在很大程度上是表演性的事件——持续一个小时的激烈辩论，派别代表们在其中相互羞辱，用隐晦的侮辱、吹嘘和夸张的修辞展示自己。锡基尔的派别很少达成一致意见，发言者理事会通过的少数提案要么无关紧要，要么很快被推翻，以维持现状。",

The Trianym consists of three cylindrical platforms with seating for scribes and spectators to witness the exchanges.

	"When the Tower Sorcerous disappeared from Sigil, it left behind an empty lot. The business that went up in its place, Fretter's Fetters and Fritters, was destroyed when the tower suddenly reappeared.

Few know the circumstances of the tower's disappearance and reappearance, or what machinations brew within.": "当塔楼巫师从锡基尔（Sigil）消失时，它留下了一片空地。在它原来的位置上建起的生意，Fretter's Fetters and Fritters，在塔楼突然重现时被摧毁。直到最近，大多数人都认为痛苦女士（Lady of Pain）将塔楼及其居民送入了迷宫。很少有人知道塔楼消失和重现的情况，或者其中蕴藏着什么阴谋。",
	"Neglected by the dabus and the generosity of other wards, the Hive Ward has fallen into disrepair. Its buildings are lopsided hodgepodges of architectural styles and materials, their floors haphazardly stacked atop one another to conserve space. The crooked high-rises darken cramped alleys, many of which are dead ends in more ways than one. Many residents of the city avoid the ward when possible, but those willing to risk the Hive can partake in its seedy establishments and hidden gems.": "被达布斯(Dabus)和其他区域的慷慨所忽视，蜂巢区已经陷入了破败之中。这里的建筑是各种建筑风格和材料的拼凑，它们的楼层杂乱地堆叠在一起以节省空间。歪斜的高楼大厦使狭窄的小巷变得昏暗，其中许多都是死胡同。城市的许多居民尽量避开这个区域，但那些愿意冒险前往蜂巢的人可以享受其中的不良场所和隐藏的宝藏。",
	"Crime is commonplace in the Hive. Grifters, cutpurses, and miscreants band together in the moldering streets, preying on the desperate and downtrodden. Pickpockets masquerade as touts, eager to pilfer coin from stumbling sots and newcomers. Professions not outwardly criminal in nature are often morally suspect, such as corpse collectors, opportunistic scavengers who scrape out a living by gathering bodies throughout the ward and delivering them to the Mortuary for meager payouts.": "在蜂巢中，犯罪是司空见惯的。骗子、扒手和恶棍聚集在腐朽的街道上，捕捉那些绝望和受压迫的人。扒手伪装成推销员，渴望从蹒跚而来的醉汉和新来者身上偷取硬币。那些看似不涉及犯罪的职业往往在道德上令人怀疑，比如尸体收集者，这些机会主义者通过在区域内收集尸体并将其送往殡仪馆以换取微薄报酬来谋生。",
	"Rain is more frequent in the Hive than elsewhere in Sigil, reflecting the ward's dismal mood. When it falls, gutters ooze sludge into brackish pools of oil and rainwater, their surfaces disturbed by scurrying cranium rats. Damp rags and swollen planks cover broken windows, blotting what little light ekes through the ward's perpetual fog.": "雨在蜂巢比锡基尔其他地方更频繁，反映了这个区域沮丧的情绪。当雨水落下时，排水沟会流出淤泥，形成积水和雨水的混合物，表面上爬满了头骨老鼠。潮湿的抹布和膨胀的木板覆盖着破碎的窗户，吸收着透过区域永恒雾气的微弱光线。",
	"Of all the wards in Sigil, the Hive Ward has the least oversight. Harmonium patrols are less frequent here, and peacekeepers have been known to avert their gaze from disreputable establishments. Though crime runs rampant, so do creativity and trade, and opportunities abound for those ready to seize them. Residents live unhampered by bureaucracy or judgment, free to pursue their deepest passions or indulge their guiltiest pleasures.": "在西格尔（Sigil）的所有区域中，蜂巢区（the Hive Ward）受到的监管最少。和谐军（Harmonium）的巡逻在这里更少，维持秩序的人也常常选择视而不见那些声誉不佳的场所。尽管犯罪猖獗，创造力和贸易也同样蓬勃发展，对于那些愿意抓住机会的人来说，机遇随处可见。居民们不受官僚主义或评判的束缚，可以自由追求他们最深的激情或沉溺于最隐秘的快乐。",
	"The following factions are headquartered in the Hive Ward:": "以下派系总部设在蜂巢区：",
	"Within the Gatehouse, members of the Bleak Cabal reject the philosophies of other factions, believing the multiverse is devoid of meaning. Bleakers combat their existential dread with optimism and compassion, enriching the lives of those in and around the Hive through small acts of service. The faction maintains a network of safe havens throughout the ward where those in need can find refuge and a warm meal.": "在门楼内，(Bleak Cabal)的成员拒绝其他派系的哲学，他们相信多元宇宙是毫无意义的。(Bleakers)用乐观和同情心对抗他们的存在恐惧，通过小小的服务行为丰富了蜂巢内外人们的生活。该派维护着整个区域的一系列安全避难所，需要帮助的人可以在那里找到庇护和温暖的一餐。",
	"Arson and vandalism are tools of the trade for the Hands of Havoc, a faction of rebels. In other wards, the Wreakers' destructive activities pave the way for reconstruction and renewal. In the Hive, however, Wreaker activity sometimes compounds the miseries of everyday life when their fires—vain attempts to garner attention from the movers and shakers of Sigil or burn away detritus within the ward—engulf the innocent. Rather than maintain a single base of operations, the Hands of Havoc operate out of warehouses strewn throughout the ward, moving constantly to evade Sigil's enforcers.": "纵火和破坏是混沌之手（Hands of Havoc）这个叛乱派系的手段。换句话说，破坏者（Wreakers）的破坏活动为重建和更新铺平道路。然而，在蜂巢（the Hive）中，破坏者的活动有时会加剧日常生活的苦难，当他们的火焰——徒劳地试图引起西吉尔（Sigil）的权势者的注意或烧毁区内的废物——波及无辜者。混沌之手并没有固定的行动基地，而是分散在整个区域的仓库中，不断移动以躲避西吉尔的执法者。",
	"The Heralds of Dust are Sigil's undertakers. They conduct funerary rites for creatures from all places, ensuring their souls pass to the next stage of death undeterred. The bulk of the faction's workforce consists of skeletons, zombies, and other dull-minded Undead whose bodies were donated to the Mortuary by their owners in life. The Dusters rely on corpse collectors—grim-faced laborers found primarily in the Hive—to deliver a steady stream of bodies to them for interment.": "尘埃使者是（Sigil）的执事。他们为来自各地的生物举行丧葬仪式，确保他们的灵魂顺利进入下一个死亡阶段。该派系的大部分劳动力由骷髅、僵尸和其他迟钝的不死生物组成，他们的尸体是生前主人捐赠给（Mortuary）的。尘埃使者依赖尸体收集者——主要在（Hive）中发现的面无表情的劳工，向他们提供用于安葬的尸体。",

	"A portal to a massive pit-fighting arena rests at the back of the Bottle and Jug, disguised as the door to an always-out-of-order lavatory for big and tall creatures. Gabel, a retired {@creature pit fiend} judge, guards the entrance, but most entrants respectfully call him \"Your Honor.\" On the other side of the door lies a bloodstained amphitheater where spectators place bets and combatants test their mettle. The current heavyweight champion is a bloodthirsty {@creature cyclops} named Akra.": "一个通往一个巨大角斗场的传送门位于瓶和罐的后面，伪装成一个永远坏掉的大型生物厕所的门。加贝尔，一位退休的法官，守卫着入口，但大多数参与者尊称他为“法官大人”。在门的另一侧是一个沾满鲜血的圆形剧场，观众们在那里下注，战斗者们展示他们的勇气。当前的重量级冠军是一位名叫阿克拉的嗜血{@creature cyclops}。",

	"Fell, a {@creature dabus|MPP} (see {@book Morte's Planar Parade|MPP}), runs a tattoo parlor in the Hive. From a distance, he looks like any other of his kind—a lean, purple-skinned figure in flowing robes, his horns protruding from a voluminous tuft of white hair atop his head. Shunned by the Lady of Pain and ostracized by his kin for declaring himself a priest of Aoskar, the dead god of portals, Fell now walks on the ground instead of floating above it. However, some of the dabus's magic remains, evident in the indelible designs he weaves into his visual rebuses.": "费尔，一名{@creature dabus|MPP}（见{@book Morte's Planar Parade|MPP}），在地狱中经营一家纹身店。从远处看，他看起来就像他种族中的其他人一样——一个身材瘦削、紫色皮肤、穿着流畅长袍的人，头顶一团白色头发中长出的角突出在上面。费尔被痛苦女士排斥，被族人排斥，因为他自称是阿斯卡（Aoskar）的祭司，这位已故的传送之神。现在，费尔走在地面上，而不是漂浮在上面。然而，达布斯的一些魔法仍然存在，体现在他编织的不可磨灭的视觉谜语中。",
	"Fell's Tattoos is a modest, oblong shack down the street from the {@book Smoldering Corpse Bar|SatO|2|Smoldering Corpse Bar} (detailed below). A pearl lightning bolt above the door marks the parlor's entrance. Inside, the quiet artist lets his handiwork speak for itself. Fell nods and smiles at his clients, producing wispy images that hang in the air and adjusting the shapes to their liking. The dabus applies each tattoo with a wave of his hand, wafting the design toward the client's skin where it grafts itself in vibrant ink.": "费尔的纹身店是一间朴素的长方形小屋，就在离{@book Smoldering Corpse Bar|SatO|2|Smoldering Corpse Bar}（以下详述）不远的街道上。门上方有一颗珍珠闪电标志着店铺的入口。店内，安静的艺术家让他的手艺说话。费尔对他的客人点头微笑，创作出飘渺的图像，悬浮在空中并根据他们的喜好调整形状。达布斯（dabus）用手一挥，将每个纹身施加在客人的皮肤上，使其在鲜艳的墨水中扎根。",
	"The dabus's tattoos are tinged with magic. Most effects are minor—a temporary glow or shifting pattern—but some designs function as {@item Spell Scroll||spell scrolls} that burn away once used, singeing hair, fur, or scales in the process. As a devotee of Aoskar and longtime resident of Sigil, Fell knows the locations of hundreds of portals throughout the City of Doors and their keys.": "达布斯的纹身被魔法染色。大多数效果都很微弱——暂时的发光或变化图案——但有些图案像{@item Spell Scroll||spell scrolls}一样发挥作用，一旦使用就会燃烧殆尽，烧焦毛发、毛皮或鳞片。作为奥斯卡的信徒，以及西格尔的资深居民，费尔知道城门之城中数百个传送门的位置及其钥匙。",
	"At the DM's discretion, Fell can reproduce any of the {@book magic tattoos|TCE|3|Magic Tattoos} detailed in {@book Tasha's Cauldron of Everything|TCE} that are common, uncommon, or rare.

	"The Bleak Cabal's headquarters is the Gatehouse, a fortress of rehabilitation and renewal. The tiered, ivory sanctuary rests on a hill at the end of Bedlam Run, a curved road that rises to meet the headquarters above the Hive.

Meanwhile spicy dishes rise to infernal heats in devil-owned rotisseries, where sadistic pitmasters boast literal kicks that sear the taste buds of the uninitiated. Sobbing patrons cool their mouths on heavenly snow cones sold by dessert-loving devas, then later shred their tongues on face-puckering sour candies topped with caustic, gelatinous ooze.

	"The Heralds of Dust look after Sigil's dead in the Mortuary, the city's morgue.

Locals wet their whistles in the dive bar, raising dented mugs to angels and devils, off the clock and shooting the breeze with each other. Heat rises through vents in the taproom's drab-tiled floors to warm banged-up metal tables, their surfaces marred by blades and stained with dried blood. The watering hole's jaded proprietor, Barkis (chaotic neutral, human {@creature veteran}), can usually be found behind the patchwork fusion of rusted metal that passes for a bar top.": "熔铁打造的烟尘尸体酒吧墙壁吸收了蜂巢中的混乱。当地人在这家小酒吧里喝酒，举起凹陷的马克杯向天使和恶魔致意，下班后和彼此闲聊。热气从酒吧的单调瓷砖地板上的通风口升起，温暖了被砍伤的金属桌子，它们的表面被刀刃划伤，沾满了干血。这家酒吧的麻木老板巴基斯（混乱中立，人类{@creature veteran}）通常可以在那个拼凑而成的生锈金属吧台后面找到。",
	"The Smoldering Corpse Bar is named for the perpetually burning mage named Ignus who hovers within. Once a pyromaniacal Wreaker who tried to reduce the Hive to ash, Ignus was imprisoned in flame as a sardonic punishment for his crimes, transforming him into a living portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Since then, he's become a fiery mascot for the bar he attempted to destroy, suspended above its torrid taproom. If doused with a {@item decanter of endless water}, Ignus rouses from his stupor as a chaotic neutral, human {@creature mage}.": "燃烧尸体酒吧以永久燃烧的法师伊格纳斯命名，他就在其中悬浮。伊格纳斯曾是一个纵火狂的破坏者，试图将蜂巢化为灰烬，但最终被囚禁在火焰中，作为对他犯罪的讽刺惩罚，将他变成了通往火元素位面的活门户。从那时起，他已成为这家他曾试图摧毁的酒吧的火热吉祥物，悬浮在其炎热的客厅上方。如果用{@item decanter of endless water}泼洒伊格纳斯，他将从麻醉状态中苏醒，成为一个混乱中立的人类{@creature mage}。",
	"The establishment has earned a reputation for reliable, albeit unremarkable, service. If the coin keeps flowing, so does the \"bub\"—a blanket term locals apply to cheap liquor. When a customer can't settle their tab, Barkis asks for collateral until the debt is paid. His backroom is filled with belongings left behind by drinkers who never returned. Most of it is junk, but Barkis lets interested parties rummage through it in exchange for completing odd jobs or serving as temporary bouncers.": "这家店以可靠而普通的服务而闻名。如果硬币不断流动，当地人就会继续喝着他们称之为\"bub\"的廉价酒。当顾客无法结清账单时，Barkis会要求提供抵押品，直到债务偿还为止。他的后房堆满了酒客留下却从未回来取的物品。大部分都是垃圾，但Barkis会让有兴趣的人在完成零工或担任临时保安的情况下翻找。",
	"Distinguished and elegant, the Lady's Ward is home to the city's movers and shakers. The regal edifices of the Lady's Ward epitomize the wealth and influence of their inhabitants. Intrigue and treachery abound, blanketed behind the sumptuous veils of high society: masked balls, gambling houses, and private banquets. The Lady of Pain doesn't reside in the ward that bears her name, but power does—the power to influence, administer, and evade the rule of law.": "高贵典雅，女士区是这座城市的权贵聚集之地。女士区的皇家建筑体现了居民的财富和影响力。阴谋和背叛在这里随处可见，隐藏在高级社交的华丽面纱后面：化装舞会、赌场和私人宴会。痛苦女士并不居住在以她命名的区域，但权力却在那里——这是影响、管理和逃避法律规定的力量。",
	"Despite its luxuries and breathtaking vistas, the Lady's Ward is quieter than other wards, its solemn streets frequented by members of the Fraternity of Order, the Harmonium, and the Mercykillers. Immovable monuments to order, these factions' imposing headquarters tower over the city blocks they occupy, surrounded by a smattering of smaller buildings that support their cycle of enforcement, adjudication, and punishment. Residents of other wards rarely visit the Lady's Ward without official business.": "尽管拥有奢华和令人叹为观止的景色，(女士区)(Lady's Ward)比其他区域更为宁静，其庄严的街道经常被(秩序之会)(Fraternity of Order)、(和谐军)(Harmonium)和(终结者)(Mercykillers)的成员所光顾。作为秩序的不可动摇的象征，这些派系的庞大总部高耸于它们所占据的城市街区之上，周围散布着一些支持它们的执法、裁决和惩罚循环的小建筑。其他区域的居民很少在没有官方业务的情况下访问(女士区)(Lady's Ward)。",
	"Fortunes are won and lost in the gambling houses of the Lady's Ward, where secret crime lords mingle with judges and off-duty guards. Greased palms lead to flimsy sentences and sudden pardons; such corruption goes ignored in the upper echelons of Sigil in favor of persecuting petty crimes elsewhere in the ward.": "在(Lady's Ward)的赌场里，财富被赢得和失去，秘密犯罪头目与法官和下班的警卫混在一起。贿赂导致轻浮的判决和突然的赦免；这种腐败在锡基尔的上层社会中被忽视，而更喜欢在该区域的其他地方迫害小罪行。",
	"As if to balance its corruption, the Lady's Ward contains over half of Sigil's temples. Deities from every pantheon find worshipers in the City of Doors. No temples to the Lady of Pain exist in the ward; to construct one is an offense worthy of banishment to {@book the Mazes|SatO|2|The Mazes}.": "似乎为了平衡其腐化，女士区拥有锡基尔一半以上的神庙。来自各个万神殿的神祇在这扇门之城找到了信徒。女痛女士没有任何神庙存在于该区；建造一个是值得被放逐到{@book the Mazes|SatO|2|The Mazes}的冒犯。",
	"\"It's the {@b Lady's Ward}, not the Ladies' Ward!\"": "\"这是{@b Lady's Ward}，不是女病房！\"",
	"The following factions are headquartered in the Lady's Ward:": "以下派系总部设在女士区：",
	"The Doomguard controls the Armory, overseeing the production and sale of weapons in Sigil. Independent smiths are free to craft and sell their own weapons, but most of the city's weapons are produced and sold by Sinkers. When it comes to providing the quality and number of armaments required by organized forces and other factions in the Cage, the Doomguard is unmatched.": "末日守卫控制着军械库，在锡基尔（Sigil）监督武器的生产和销售。独立铁匠可以自由制作和销售自己的武器，但大多数城市的武器都是由沉沦者（Sinkers）生产和销售的。在为组织力量和笼中其他派系所需的武器质量和数量方面，末日守卫是无与伦比的。",
	"Consisting of judges, lawyers, and legislators, the Fraternity of Order abides by the letter of the law—and exploits it to further their interests. Dispassionate and impartial, Guvners run the city courts, ruling on everything from petty disputes in other wards to groundbreaking cases in the High Courts. They adjudicate, review, and study the rules of Sigil, maintaining order according to the law as they interpret it.": "由法官、律师和立法者组成，(Fraternity of Order)（秩序兄弟会）严格遵守法律的字面意义，并利用法律来促进他们的利益。冷静公正的(Guvners)（管理者）管理城市法院，裁决从其他区域的小争端到高等法院的重大案件。他们裁决、审查和研究锡基尔的规则，根据他们的解释维护法律秩序。",
	"A faction of rugged peacekeepers, the Harmonium occupies the Barracks and serves as the city watch. Noble do-gooders and vengeful chastisers alike join their ranks, eager to quash crime. Thousands of crimson-plated Harmonium officers patrol Sigil's wards daily, vowing to keep their streets clean. However, the Hardheads' uncompromising vision of order sometimes leads to wrongful arrests.": "一群强悍的和平维护者，和谐军（Harmonium）占据了兵营，担任城市警卫。高尚的行善者和报复的惩罚者都会加入他们的行列，渴望镇压犯罪。成千上万身披深红铠甲的和谐军官员每天在西格尔（Sigil）的区域巡逻，誓言保持街道清洁。然而，铁头（Hardheads）对秩序的不妥协视野有时会导致错误的逮捕。",
	"When the Fraternity of Order deems a citizen guilty of a crime, the Mercykillers carry out the punishment. Citizens give these emotionless executioners a wide berth, fearful of obstructing justice and becoming the next target. Though most of their work occurs in the {@book Prison|SatO|2|Prison}, members of the faction regularly mete out discipline in public for all to see.": "当秩序兄弟会认定一个市民犯罪时，(Mercykillers)执行惩罚。市民们都远远避开这些毫无情感的刽子手，害怕阻碍正义而成为下一个目标。尽管他们的大部分工作发生在{@book Prison|SatO|2|Prison}，但这个派系的成员经常在公共场合进行惩戒，供所有人观看。",
	"Presented here are some noteworthy sites in the Lady's Ward.": "这里介绍了女士区（Lady's Ward）一些值得注意的地点。",
	"The Doomguard is headquartered in the Armory, a foreboding stronghold at the ward's border with the Lower Ward. Deliberately grown razorvine creeps along the structure's bladed balconies and lower walls, deterring thieves who seek to steal the weapons within. Heavy metal gates bar its few windows, and a relief of a menacing horned skull—the faction's symbol—hangs over its main entrance within. Day and night, the Armory's chimneys belch smoke and flame.": "末日守卫队总部设在军械库，这是一个位于边界与下层区之间的令人不安的要塞。故意种植的刀刃藤蔓沿着建筑物的阳台和下部墙壁蔓延，阻止那些试图偷取内部武器的小偷。厚重的金属大门挡住了它为数不多的窗户，而一尊威胁性的有角头骨浮雕——该派系的象征——悬挂在主入口上方。白天和黑夜，军械库的烟囱喷出浓烟和火焰。",
	"A colossal forge dominates the first floor of the Armory, which is open to the public. Mercenaries, mongers, and other curious buyers gawk at industrious smithies accustomed to the forge's unbearable temperatures. Azers, fire elementals, and chain devils number among the Armory's blacksmiths, along with dwarves and other Doomguard smiths.": "一个巨大的熔炉占据了军械库的一楼，对公众开放。雇佣兵、商人和其他好奇的买家们目瞪口呆地看着习惯了熔炉难以忍受的高温的勤劳铁匠。阿兹尔(Azers)、火元素(fire elementals)和锁链恶魔(chain devils)是军械库的铁匠之一，还有矮人和其他末日卫士(Doomguard)的铁匠。",
	"Aslan Ashfang, a lawful neutral {@creature efreeti} merchant from the City of Brass, emerges from the forge's coals to greet potential buyers. A clever and convincing salesman, Aslan brokers deals between the Doomguard and interested parties. The dapper efreeti knows every weapon in the Sinker catalog and its price, from delicate jeweled daggers to massive siege weapons. Items small enough to display—or their replicas if too precious or dangerous—are showcased in an exhibition hall just inside the Armory.": "阿斯兰·阿什方 (Aslan Ashfang)，来自黄铜之城，是一位守序中立 {@creature efreeti} 的商人，从锻炉的煤炭中走出来，迎接潜在的买家。作为一个聪明而有说服力的推销员，阿斯兰在末日守卫和感兴趣的交易方之间进行交易。这位时髦的伊弗利特知道沉没者目录中的每一种武器及其价格，从精致的宝石匕首到庞大的攻城武器。尺寸足够小以展示的物品——或者如果太珍贵或太危险的话，它们的复制品——都在军械库内的展览厅展示。",
	"Beyond the forge lie four heavily guarded chambers, each containing a portal to a fortress on the edge of one of the Inner Planes. Within these citadels, the four doom lords—high-ranking faction lieutenants with powers of entropy and destruction—observe the multiverse and its beauteous decay. From these citadels, members of the Doomguard launch expeditions to hunt or capture destructive monsters across the multiverse, testing their skills against terrifying creatures and deadly extremes.": "在熔炉之外，有四个受到严密守卫的房间，每个房间里都有一扇通往内在位面边缘堡垒的传送门。在这些城堡里，四位厄运领主——拥有熵与毁灭之力的高级派系中尉——观察着多元宇宙及其美丽的腐朽。从这些城堡中，厄运守护者的成员发起探险，跨越多元宇宙追捕或捕获破坏性怪物，考验他们对可怕生物和致命极端的技能。",
	"The Armory sells every weapon, shield, and armor in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} at normal cost. At the DM's discretion, the Armory might have other armaments available for sale, such as {@item +1 Weapon||+1 weapons} for 300 gp apiece.": "军械库以正常价格销售{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的每一种武器、盾牌和盔甲。鉴于DM的判断，军械库可能会有其他武器可供出售，比如{@item +1 Weapon||+1 weapons}，每件售价300 gp。",
	"Hushed streets surround the Barracks, a wide compound of cold granite at the opposite end of the Lady's Ward from the Armory. Stoic and impenetrable, the lofty fortress houses the rank and file of the Harmonium, Sigil's militant guards and enforcers. Taciturn sentries march along its spiked, gray-slate roof, gazing over a largely deserted precinct. Life this close to the Hardheads is a double-edged sword. While local businesses—of which there are few—enjoy on-demand security, their proprietors must be spotless in the eyes of the law or suffer crackdowns from overzealous disciplinarians in the faction, who enforce Factol Sarin's orders without question.": "宁静的街道环绕着兵营，这是一座宽敞的冷冰川化合物，位于女神区的对面，与军械库相对。这座高大的堡垒坚忍不拔，是锡基尔的激进卫兵和执法者——和谐会的普通成员的住所。寡言的哨兵沿着它带刺的灰板岩屋顶行进，俯瞰着一个大部分空无一人的区域。生活在硬头部队如此近的地方是一把双刃剑。尽管当地的企业——虽然寥寥无几——享受着随需应变的安全保障，但他们的所有者必须在法律眼中一尘不染，否则会受到派系中过于热心的纪律者的镇压，他们毫无疑问地执行法克托·萨林的命令。",
	"The Barracks are open to all enthusiastic peacekeepers, though Hardheads stop and interrogate anyone who ventures past the clasped stone hands over the stronghold's arched entrance. Straitlaced recruiters pressure visitors without a clear faction allegiance to enlist in the Harmonium and reap its benefits.": "兵营对所有热心的维和者开放，尽管强硬者会拦下并审问任何冒险越过堡垒拱门上的扣手的人。拘谨的招募人员会向没有明确派系归属的访客施加压力，要求他们加入和谐军并获得其好处。",
	"Composed of four identical sections and the squat towers that join them, the Barracks surround a wide parade ground. The Harmonium shows its strength within the quad through drills, marches, and other ceremonial displays. Beyond the grounds lie classrooms and living quarters, along with the faction's archives, which include current and past Harmonium patrol routes, active members and their ranks, and official arrest records.": "由四个相同的部分和连接它们的矮塔组成，兵营环绕着一个宽阔的操场。和谐管风琴通过操练、行军和其他仪式展示在这个方形区域内展示其力量。在这些场地之外是教室和住宿区，以及该派系的档案，其中包括当前和过去的和谐管风琴巡逻路线、活跃成员及其级别，以及官方逮捕记录。",
	"With an official writ from Factol Sarin, the factol of an allied faction, or an influential figure in Sigil, one can gain temporary protection services or extra muscle in the form of a few reliable guards who stubbornly obey every city ordinance.": "凭借来自事实领袖萨林(Factol Sarin)的正式文书，或者来自一个盟友派系的领袖，或者锡基尔(Sigil)的一个有影响力的人物，一个人可以获得临时的保护服务或额外的力量，即几名可靠的卫兵，他们顽固地遵守每一项城市法令。",
	"Luck abounds at Fortune's Wheel, an extravagant casino and favored hotspot in the Lady's Ward. It's run by {@creature Shemeshka|MPP} (see {@book Morte's Planar Parade|MPP}), a vain and ambitious yugoloth crime lord of multiversal renown. Rarely spotted in the common areas of the gambling hall, the arcanaloth is the picture of wealth, power, and influence, always dressed to the nines and crowned with a spidery razorvine headdress. In Shemeshka's eyes, the establishment's profits pale in comparison to its true spoils: secrets gleaned by her web of spies, both those employed in the casino and others enacting her far-reaching schemes.": "幸运之轮赌场是一个奢华的赌场，也是女神区的热门去处。它由{@creature Shemeshka|MPP}（见{@book Morte's Planar Parade|MPP}）经营，他是一个虚荣而雄心勃勃的多元宇宙中著名的尤戈洛斯犯罪头目。这位奥术尤戈洛斯很少出现在赌场的公共区域，他是财富、权力和影响力的典范，总是穿着光鲜亮丽，头戴一顶蜘蛛般的剃刀藤冠。在舍梅什卡的眼中，这家赌场的利润相比于其真正的战利品而言微不足道：她的间谍网络获取的秘密，既包括在赌场工作的人员，也包括执行她广泛计划的其他人。",
	"Like moths to a candle, risk takers gravitate to the buzzing marquee of Fortune's Wheel. The polished revolving door of this recently renovated building opens into the historic Dragon Bar, a modest tavern named for the carved dragon head that watches over it. Beyond this reception area and its alert bouncers lies the casino proper.": "就像飞蛾扑火一样，冒险者们被吸引到了幸运之轮的热闹招牌下。这座最近翻新的建筑的抛光旋转门打开，通往历史悠久的龙吧，一个以守护其的雕刻龙头而命名的朴素小酒馆。在这个接待区和警觉的保安之后是正式的赌场。",

These games take razorleaf gambling chips, golden tokens that bear a stylized razorvine emblem.": "豪华的地毯赌场大厅里摆满了各种游戏，其中传来一阵阵洗牌卡牌、掷骰子和嗡嗡作响的发条老虎机声。这些游戏使用着剃刀叶赌注筹码，这些金色代币上刻着一枚风格化的剃刀藤徽章。",
	"Every evening, performances grace an ornate, curtained stage, but the real star of the casino is its namesake: the fortune's wheel, a three-tiered, standing roulette wheel where inheritances are squandered and made. Weapons and luck-altering magic are prohibited within the casino, but the staff enforces the policy only in the most blatant of violations.": "每天晚上，演出在一座华丽的帘幕舞台上上演，但赌场的真正明星是它的名字：命运之轮，一个三层立式的轮盘赌轮，在那里继承被挥霍和创造。在赌场内禁止携带武器和改变运气的魔法，但工作人员只在最明显的违规行为中执行这一政策。",
	"Known to few and hidden within the casino are the Platinum Rooms, a collection of demiplanar chambers where interplanar fat cats wager ancient artifacts, trapped souls, and the fates of entire worlds. Accessible only to bigwigs trusted with special portal keys, the Platinum Rooms feature a rogue's gallery of some of the multiverse's most dangerous players.": "在赌场内鲜为人知的是铂金房间，这是一组半位面房间，那里跨位面的大人物们押注古老文物、被困灵魂，甚至整个世界的命运。只有被信任并授予特殊传送门钥匙的大人物才能进入铂金房间，这里汇聚了一些多元宇宙中最危险的角色。",

Nicknamed the Sun of Sigil, it glows each day at dawn.": "闪耀的光芒汇聚在《心之火》（Heart's Fire）的彩色玻璃窗上，这是一座致力于火神、真理和光明的明亮神庙。金色的波浪状刀片悬浮在教堂之上，宛如火焰。被昵称为锡基尔之日（Sun of Sigil），它每天黎明时分都会发光。",
	"Recently, Heart's Fire has become the subject of gossip throughout the Temple District. The temple's former high priest, a {@creature deva} named Ephemera, was called away on a divine errand. Before departing, the angel appointed a controversial replacement to guide the fane in their stead: Mihr, a lawful good {@creature horned devil} who turned their back on the Nine Hells long ago. Kind and merciful, the new high priest hopes the congregation will see their redeemed nature, but some of the temple's clergy refuse to accept Mihr as the true high priest.": "最近，心火（Heart's Fire）已成为整个神殿区（Temple District）的八卦话题。这座神殿的前任高阶祭司，一位名叫Ephemera的{@creature deva}，被神圣的使命召唤离开。在离开之前，这位天使任命了一个备受争议的接班人来指导神殿：Mihr，一位早年背弃九层地狱的秩序善良{@creature horned devil}。作为新任高阶祭司，Mihr善良仁慈，希望会众能看到他们的改过自新，但是一些神殿的神职人员拒绝接受Mihr作为真正的高阶祭司。",
	"The scales of justice are balanced at the High Courts of Sigil, headquarters of the Fraternity of Order. The courthouse is a dignified edifice hewn from flawless, white marble with towers that rise from the structure's bladed gables. Granite steps ascend the courthouse's elevated entrance, above which hangs a triangular pediment. Etched within the architrave is the faction's motto: \"Knowledge is power.\"": "在锡基尔高等法院，正义的天平平衡着，这里是秩序之友总部。法院是一座庄严的建筑，由无瑕的白色大理石雕琢而成，塔楼从建筑的刀尖状山墙上升起。花岗岩台阶通往法院的高耸入口，上方悬挂着一个三角形的山脊。在横梁上刻有该派系的座右铭：“知识就是力量。”",
	"Though absolute authority in Sigil belongs to the Lady of Pain, most legal matters are settled in the city's tribunals, often decided by a single, supposedly impartial magistrate appointed by the Guvners. Punishments are tailored to fit the crime, and advocates are strongly encouraged. Lawyers and orators, these civil servants include bards, faction agents, and devils with a knack for navigating the subtleties of the law.": "尽管锡基尔（Sigil）的绝对权力属于疼痛女士（Lady of Pain），但大多数法律事务都是在城市的法庭中解决的，通常由一名据称是中立的法官（由管事者（Guvners）任命）来决定。 惩罚是根据罪行量身定制的，鼓励强烈支持。 这些公务员包括律师和演说家，他们擅长航行法律的微妙之处，其中包括诗人、派系特工和恶魔。",
	"While cheap advocates linger on the courthouse steps hoping to find work, their arguments are brittle. Brilliant barristers demand high retainers, but they're worth every coin when the alternative is a visit from the Mercykillers. One talented attorney is \"Sly\" Nye (chaotic neutral, tiefling {@creature noble}), who claims to have never lost a case. Sly has been known to waive their astronomical fee for adventurers who help gather evidence relevant to other cases. Of course, the accused are always free to represent themselves.": "在法院门口徘徊的廉价辩护律师们希望能找到工作，他们的论点脆弱。杰出的辩护律师要求高额留用金，但当另一种选择是被“慈悲杀手”找上门时，他们每一枚硬币都是值得的。一位才华横溢的律师是“狡诈”奈{@creature noble}（混乱中立，鬼族），声称从未输过一场官司。狡诈曾因冒险者帮助收集与其他案件相关的证据而放弃他们天文数字的费用。当然，被告始终可以自行辩护。",
	"The rear tower consists primarily of lesser courts, which resound with procedural bickering and the rapping of gavels.

	"Ominous chants echo in the Infinite Well, a temple to the Abyss and its untold layers. The temple hovers high above the surrounding houses of worship, floating above a seemingly bottomless pit. Tarnished blades jut from the Infinite Well like metal branches on a blackened tree. Rather than the blue-green verdigris common throughout the city, blood trickles down the temple's rusted spikes.

	"Because there are infinite layers to the Abyss, there are infinite demon lords among them to be venerated. As a result, the cultists of the temple are a disorganized mess, and daily sacrifices sourced from among the faithful cause their numbers to dwindle.

	"A single grim blemish of gray stone and metal rises above Sigil's resplendent courthouses. Headquarters of the Mercykillers, the Prison is a warning to wrongdoers of the full penalty of law.

These short-lived occasions are cause for celebration among the folk of the Lower Ward, who spend the day bathing in the refreshing reservoir.": "当地人低声说，水沟是冥河的一条支流，但更有可能是其有毒的水源于工业废水排放，再加上附近传送门泄漏的下位面腐化。在罕见的情况下，通往河海神的传送门会在水沟中打开，这是一条贯穿上位面的天堂水道，使得水沟变得清澈、银白且甜美。这些短暂的时刻是下层区居民庆祝的理由，他们会花一天的时间在这清新的水域中沐浴。",

	"Like any commercial hub, the Market Ward has its problems. Shopkeeps from every plane compete in its marketplaces, and petty quarrels between business owners can develop into violent, centuries-long feuds between planar entities. Some vendors stubbornly refuse traditional currencies, guffawing at the notion that gold, of all things, has any value at all—in the grand scheme of the multiverse, few minerals are as rare as their worth might suggest. They might accept favors or prefer to barter instead.

Indeps keep to themselves and generally abstain from conflict, but they rally to defend their own when necessary.": "许多与锡基尔(Sigil)崛起派系没有强烈联系的人加入了自由联盟(Free League)，这是一个由务实公民组成的非正式组织，他们在探讨多元宇宙的真相时保持开放的选择。自由联盟的成员在锡基尔扮演着各种角色，但他们倾向于独立经营，充当商人、雇佣兵，甚至其他派系的间谍。独立派(Indeps)独来独往，通常避免冲突，但在必要时会团结起来保卫自己。",
	"Headquartered in the Great Gymnasium, the Transcendent Order strives for harmony in all things. Members hone their bodies and minds through rigorous conditioning, and they regularly challenge others in the Market Ward to contests of artistic, athletic, or spiritual prowess. Because Ciphers tend to avoid making allies or enemies, they regularly offer their balanced perspectives to other factions as neutral advisors and mediators.": "总部设在大体育馆，超凡秩序致力于在一切事物中追求和谐。成员们通过严格的锻炼磨练身心，并经常在市场区挑战他人，展示自己在艺术、运动或精神方面的才能。由于密码者倾向于避免结交盟友或敌人，他们经常作为中立顾问和调解人向其他派系提供平衡的观点。",

	"When creatures amass hoards too large to defend, they can store excess treasure in secure vaults beneath the Bank of Abbathor. The guarded rows of armored doors are pure theater, empty repositories designed to comfort investors and confuse would-be plunderers. Only the doors themselves matter, for the true vaults lie beyond the portals they contain. Accessible only by account owners, authorized bank personnel, or creatures in possession of the corresponding portal key, each vault door leads to a demiplanar dungeon that guards the riches deposited within.": "当生物积累了太多无法防守的财宝时，它们可以将多余的财宝存放在阿巴索银行（Bank of Abbathor）地下安全金库中。这些防守森严的装甲门排列整齐，实际上是纯粹的表演，空的仓库旨在安抚投资者并迷惑潜在的掠夺者。唯有门本身才重要，因为真正的金库位于它们所包含的门户之外。只有账户所有者、授权的银行人员或持有相应门户钥匙的生物才能进入，每扇金库门通往一个守护着其中存放财富的半位面地牢。",
	"Ancient dragons, mighty devils, and immortal merchants make up the bank's board of directors, who ensure the institution's reach continues to widen. They seek power through profit, conquering worlds without armies of their own by bankrolling like-minded groups in conflicts across the multiverse.": "古老的龙、强大的恶魔和不朽的商人组成了银行的董事会，他们确保机构的影响力不断扩大。他们通过利润谋求权力，通过资助跨越多元宇宙的冲突中志同道合的团体，征服世界而无需拥有自己的军队。",

At heart, Laril is a rebel. Many of the tubs in her bathhouse have false bottoms for harboring fugitives or smuggling contraband.

They cater to adventurous taste buds and deep appetites, challenging expectations about food and the forms it takes.

Bedlam's spiteful residents plug their ears and communicate through shouts or irritated, nonverbal gestures.": "一座黑曜石塔突出于阴郁盆地底部，其尖顶是一只向天空伸展的延长手。这座塔被称为萨布利奇(`Sablereach`)，传言是一位被遗忘的死神的石化手臂。在其掌心里居住着门卫，贝德拉姆(`Bedlam`)遥远的统治者。白天黑夜，从塔基的六个拱形孔洞——气闸门——喷发出尖叫的风，使得在镇子最低的区域无法进行交谈。贝德拉姆的怨恨居民塞住耳朵，通过大声或恼怒的非语言手势进行交流。",
	"The bitter winds of Pandemonium erode the gate-town inside and out. Repairs to wind-blasted buildings are constant, and anything not nailed or tethered down is as good as lost. The gusts gnaw at Bedlam's residents just as they do its structures. The citizens' patience, manners, and joy dwindle in the wake of the gate-town's ceaseless gales. Nowhere is safe from the winds. Even when the gusts are dampened, their whispers slip through the cracks and magically encourage townsfolk to commit dark deeds against their neighbors.": "乱世门镇(Pandemonium)的刺骨寒风侵蚀着内外。对于被风吹袭的建筑物，修复工作是持续不断的，任何没有被钉住或系牢的东西都几乎等同于丧失。狂乱之地(Bedlam)的居民受到的侵蚀与其建筑物一样。在这座门镇无休止的狂风中，市民的耐心、礼仪和快乐在风暴过后逐渐消逝。没有任何地方能够避风。即使风势减弱，它们的低语也会从缝隙中溜出，魔法般地激励镇民对邻居们进行黑暗行为。",
	"Bedlam's blustering gate resides at the base of Sablereach. Six iron blastgates bore through the ebony arm, each spewing a constant jet of bitingly cold wind that wails as it exits. Those stalwart enough to reach a blastgate can eventually push their way to the gate chamber: a pressurized obsidian hall adorned with rattling iron hand rings. Entrants must grasp the rings or be sent tumbling backward by the squalls that spew from the gate. A massive chain, tethered to the floor and held stiff by a thick layer of muddy ice, extends up into the howling portal set within the chamber's vaulted ceiling.": "混乱之门(Bedlam)位于萨布利奇(Sablereach)的基地。六扇铁制爆炸门穿过乌木臂，每一扇门都喷出一股刺骨寒风，随着它的流出而哀嚎。那些足够坚定的人最终可以推开一扇爆炸门，进入门厅：一个装饰着响亮铁手环的高压黑曜石大厅。进入者必须抓住这些环，否则会被从门中喷出的狂风冲击而倒退。一条巨大的链条，系在地板上，并被一层厚厚的泥冰固定，延伸至大厅拱顶内的咆哮门户。",

	"When the winds reversed, they spat out Bedlam's current gatekeeper: Cirrus the Silent, a chaotic neutral {@creature cloud giant} born in the unforgiving darkness of Pandemonium. None have heard Cirrus speak. The giant's words are carried on the winds as eerie voices that invade the minds of her subjects.": "当风向逆转时，它们吐出了Bedlam的现任守门人：Cirrus the Silent，一个混乱中立{@creature cloud giant}，出生在Pandemonium无情的黑暗中。没有人听过Cirrus说话。这位巨人的话语随风传播，化为诡异的声音侵入她的臣民的心灵。",

From outside, the joint looks like a giant, upturned blade.": "Gatemouth区域的脾气暴躁居民可以在眼睛和匕首旅馆（Eye and Dagger）休息，这是贝德拉姆（Bedlam）最受欢迎的酒店。磨损的镍片覆盖着这座狭窄、三角形建筑的外部，它用刀锋般的边缘穿过贝德拉姆的风。眼睛和匕首大部分没有窗户——贝德拉姆下层区域的许多建筑完全不设窗户，以免被风吹来的危险碎片打碎——旅馆的屋顶尖尖的。从外面看，这家旅馆就像一个巨大的、翻转的刀刃。",

The duchess and her senators tolerate its proprietor, an {@creature ice devil} named Sparax who helps dry-tongued locals quench their thirst with chilled cocktails. The heat from the glowing lava fall behind the bar keeps drink orders coming. Loose-lipped nobles regularly spill secrets and rumors to Sparax, who always keeps one antenna to the ground.": "如同熔化的血液，炽热的岩浆从石质的肋骨中涌出，流入位于Ribcage较富裕区的Bleeding Horn酒馆的酒吧。公爵夫人和她的参议员们容忍它的老板，一位名叫Sparax的{@creature ice devil}，他帮助口渴的当地人用冰镇鸡尾酒解渴。吧台后面发出的热量让饮品订单不断增加。多嘴的贵族经常向Sparax泄露秘密和谣言，而他总是保持着一只触角贴近大地。",
	"A walled, ebony fortress rests on a dusty crag in the center of town. Considered Ribcage's exclusive sixth district, the Citadel of Cinders is the gate-town's seat of law and corruption. Here, Duchess Zurkbane's senators—an easily manipulated quintet of bloated, self-important sycophants—help her maintain the illusion of a just government.": "一座被墙围绕的乌木堡垒矗立在镇中的一块尘土飞扬的岩壁上。被视为里布凯奇（Ribcage）独有的第六区，灰烬城堡（Citadel of Cinders）是这座门户之城的法律与腐败中心。在这里，朱兹班公爵夫人（Duchess Zurkbane）的参议员们——一群容易被操纵的五个膨胀自大、自命不凡的谄媚者——帮助她维持一个公正政府的幻象。",
	"An iron statue of Duchess Zurkbane stands in the citadel's courtyard, holding aloft a pair of burning scales. Behind it lies the Court of Cinders, an ornate house of law where devil magistrates administer justice on behalf of the diabolical courts of the Nine Hells.

The resort leverages a network of scalding geysers and terraced volcanic springs to create a paradise of steam rooms, saunas, and luxurious baths. Nobles schmooze with mercenaries and sellswords in the gymnasium's humid, ruby-tiled chambers, plotting the demise or demotion of their neighbors.

	"Generals stoke the fires of war in Rigus, a permanent military encampment linked to a plane of battle and bloodshed. Constructed in tiers on a fortified hill, Rigus is a monument to military strength. Eight octagonal iron walls, menacing and impenetrable, divide the town into seven stacked rings festooned with banners of war. Advanced siege weapons are anchored to their angular battlements. Soldiers rise at the crack of dawn to the punctual call of brass horns, filling the gate-town's tented circuits with the drum of marching boots and cadence calls sung by warriors honing their bodies for an unending war.": "将军们在里格斯（Rigus）煽动战争的烈火，这是一个永久的军事营地，与一个充满战斗和流血的位面相连。里格斯建在一个坚固的山丘上，分层建造，是军事力量的象征。八个八角形的铁墙威胁而坚不可摧，将城镇分成七个堆叠的环，挂满了战争的旗帜。先进的攻城武器固定在他们的角形城垛上。士兵们在黎明的第一缕曙光中起床，听到铜号的准时呼唤，用军号的节奏唱着士兵们的队列呼号，磨练他们的身体，为永无止境的战争做准备。",
	"Rigus follows a strict military hierarchy in which everyone has a rank. Commoners and green recruits come in as privates, the lowest designation in the gate-town save for prisoners of war. Their arms tire from saluting their superiors and thankless, menial work. Citizens are expected to comply with orders from commanding officers, who don't tolerate disobedience lightly. With time and dedication, ambitious cadets can graduate to respected positions. Accomplished adventurers quickly ascend the ladder, but unproven visitors—called \"slates\" after the blank, chalk-white badges they wear within the town—are paid little attention.": "Rigus（里格斯）遵循严格的军事等级制度，每个人都有自己的军衔。普通人和新兵以列兵的身份进入，这是除了战俘之外在城门镇中最低的等级。他们的手臂因为向上级敬礼和无私的琐碎工作而感到疲惫。市民被期望服从指挥官的命令，而指挥官们对不服从行为不轻易放过。有抱负的学员经过时间和奉献可以毕业并晋升到受人尊敬的职位。成就卓越的冒险者很快就能攀登阶梯，但未经证实的访客——在城镇内被称为“板块”（slates）因为他们佩戴的空白、粉白色的徽章而受到很少的关注。",
	"The six Crown Generals are the top brass in Rigus. Seasoned tacticians with centuries of battlefield experience between them, they command the armies of nations. Among them is General Braahg (lawful neutral {@creature hobgoblin warlord}), a broad-shouldered, gray-haired commander from the world of Toril. Clad in crimson plate, the general pays homage to the Red Knight, a god of strategy whom he reveres. Deep down, Braahg hates war and all its destruction. Stern and contemplative, he moves the pawns in his war tent with deliberation, knowing each toppled piece represents thousands of casualties. The pensive general harbors many secrets, the darkest of which can end entire worlds. Braahg's disdain for the conflict he oversees is counter to the gate-town's warlike nature and tempers Rigus just enough to keep it in the Outlands.": "六位王冠将军是Rigus的最高军官。 他们是经验丰富的战术家，在他们之间拥有数个世纪的战场经验，指挥着各国的军队。 其中之一是Braahg将军（守序中立{@creature hobgoblin warlord}），来自Toril世界的一个肩宽阔的、白发的指挥官。 穿着深红色的板甲，将军向他崇敬的战略之神红衣骑士致敬。 内心深处，Braahg憎恶战争及其所有破坏。 严厉而沉思的他在战争帐篷里审慎地移动着棋子，明白每个倒下的棋子代表着成千上万的伤亡。 这位沉思的将军隐藏着许多秘密，其中最黑暗的秘密足以毁灭整个世界。 Braahg对他监督的冲突的厌恶与门户城镇好战的本性相悖，足以使Rigus保持在外域的边缘。",
	"The gate to Acheron rests in a spacious hangar deep beneath the tiered hill. In addition to natural underground tunnels, the chamber has two main entrances. One is a mile-long, wrought-iron staircase located in the gate-town's highest district: the Crown. The other lies in plain sight—a massive, octagonal elevator that comprises Rigus's penultimate ring. The platform responds only to the Crown Generals, who can lower the district—along with armies and weapons of war—to the gate chamber.": "阿克隆之门位于层层叠叠的山丘下方的一个宽敞的飞行场地中。除了自然地下隧道外，这个房间还有两个主要入口。一个是长达一英里的锻铁楼梯，位于门镇最高的区域：皇冠区。另一个就在眼前——一个巨大的八角形电梯，构成了里格斯的倒数第二环。这个平台只对皇冠将军们作出响应，他们可以将区域——连同军队和战争武器——降至门厅。",
	"Nicknamed the Lion's Gate, the portal looks like an enormous feline eye within an arch of bones, a gaseous curtain bisected by a roaring black stripe.": "被昵称为狮子之门，这个门户看起来像是一个巨大的猫眼，位于一座骨头拱门内，一道被一条咆哮的黑色条纹切开的气体帷幕。",

	"Rigus largely forgoes inns and taverns in favor of its bunkers, an underground complex of barracks and mess halls connected to all but the gate-town's topmost ring. While there's plenty of room to quarter soldiers above ground, generals find the cramped tunnel conditions foster more aggressive warriors. Life in the bunkers is mandatory for the gate-town's rank and file, but visitors typically prefer to stay at the Broken Slate, an enduring surface tavern.": "瑞格斯（Rigus）在很大程度上放弃了客栈和酒馆，而是选择了它的地下掩体，这是一个与除了城门镇的最顶层环路相连的兵营和餐厅的地下综合体。虽然地面上有足够的空间来驻扎士兵，但将军们发现狭窄的隧道条件会培养出更具侵略性的战士。在地下掩体的生活对于城门镇的普通士兵来说是强制性的，但游客通常更喜欢留在“破碎石板”（Broken Slate），这是一家历史悠久的地面酒馆。",
	"In addition to housing, the bunkers contain the gate-town's armory and vehicle-storage facilities, as well as secluded administrative chambers where officials negotiate and strategize. Fetchtatter—a contemptible {@creature arcanaloth} loyal to Bel, a former archdevil—frequents the bunkers. He acts as an infernal arms broker, selling war machines to the Crown Generals of Rigus.": "除了住房外，掩体还包括城门镇的军械库和车辆存储设施，以及偏僻的行政议事厅，官员们在那里进行谈判和制定战略。Fetchtatter—一个卑鄙的{@creature arcanaloth}，效忠于Bel，一位前执政魔王—经常出没在掩体中。他充当地狱武器经纪人的角色，向Rigus的王冠将军们出售战争机器。",
	"While everyday soldiers are buried and honored in the Final Procession (detailed below), the generals of Acheron are entombed in the mausoleums of the Crown, Rigus's dignified topmost ring. While some Crown Generals are content to enjoy the early retirement that death brings, others refuse to rest, joining a shadowy cabal of Undead warriors. Reborn as ghosts, liches, and mummy lords, they guide the Crown Generals from beyond the grave. The most feared and respected among them is the {@creature death knight} Nagaro, a former paladin from the world of Krynn who severed her oath in her pursuit of conquest. While the strategies of other Undead generals in her company have grown stale with their desiccation, General Nagaro remains as sharp and ruthless as ever.": "在阿克伦将军被埋葬并受到终极仪式（详见下文）的同时，阿克伦的将军们被安葬在王冠陵墓中，这是里格斯尊贵的最高环。虽然一些王冠将军满足于享受死亡带来的早期退休，但其他人拒绝休息，加入了一个幽暗的不死战士秘密团体。作为幽灵、巫妖和木乃伊领主重生，他们在坟墓之外引导着王冠将军。其中最受人畏惧和尊敬的是{@creature death knight}纳加罗，她是来自克瑞恩世界的一名前圣武士，因为征服的追求而背弃了她的誓言。尽管她所在的其他不死将军的战略随着他们的干燥变得陈旧，纳加罗将军仍然像以往一样敏锐而无情。",
	"A monument of reflection amid a hungry machine of death, the Final Procession is dedicated to the countless lives sacrificed in conflicts across the multiverse.
