	"Imagination drives innovation and inspires communal creation. For this geeky theater kid, imagination was my solace.": "想象力推动了创新，激发了共同的创造。对于这个怪胎般的戏剧小子来说，想象力是我的慰藉。",
	"It is through the original campaign following the exploits of the adventuring party Vox Machina, with myself helming the narrative as the Dungeon Master, that I began crafting the continent of Tal'Dorei and the world of Exandria for my friends to explore. Expanding this world with each heroic venture my friends took on, each unique facet of their characters' stories enriching this realm that otherwise existed entirely in my head, Exandria began to grow and mature, feeling at times like it was taking on a life of its own. By the end of that journey, as the heroes of Vox Machina completed their majestic tale, we all knew we had created something special. However, that was but the first of many tales we wanted to weave.": "正是通过最初的战役，在我作为地下城主掌舵的情况下，跟随冒险队伍Vox Machina的探索，我开始为我的朋友们制作Tal'Dorei大陆和Exandria的世界，供他们探索。随着我的朋友们进行的每一次英雄冒险，他们的角色故事的每一个独特方面都丰富了这个完全存在于我脑海中的领域，艾克桑德里亚开始成长和成熟，有时感觉它就像有了自己的生命。在这段旅程结束时，当《Vox Machina》的英雄们完成了他们宏伟的故事时，我们都知道我们创造了一些特别的东西。然而，这只是我们想要编织的许多故事中的第一个。",
	"A second campaign began shortly thereafter, this time taking place in the neighboring continent of Wildemount, a land bound by dark history, political struggle, and dangerous secrets simmering beneath the surface of everyday life. Now knowing the complexity my players were willing to engage with, I developed Wildemount on a scale and level of intricacy I had not previously attempted. I excitedly watched as this region of Exandria took shape, and it was here the Mighty Nein (as they came to be called) began their adventures, which they currently continue to the day of my writing this foreword. Wildemount expanded into a vast, complex, and delightful setting that I continued to grow more and more proud of. Then the incredible opportunity arose to collaborate with Wizards of the Coast to bring this setting to you in printed form.": "第二次战役很快就开始了，这次发生在邻近的荒野山庄大陆，那是一片被黑暗历史、政治斗争和日常生活表面下酝酿的危险秘密所束缚的土地。现在我知道了我的玩家愿意参与的复杂性，我以我以前从未尝试过的规模和复杂程度来开发荒野山庄。我兴奋地看着埃克桑德里亚的这一地区逐渐成形，\"强大的尼恩\"（他们后来被称为）就在这里开始了他们的冒险，直到我写这篇前言的那天，他们还在继续冒险。荒野山庄扩展为一个庞大、复杂和令人愉快的环境，我对它越来越感到自豪。然后，出现了一个令人难以置信的机会，那就是与海岸奇才合作，将这个设定以印刷的形式带给你。",
	"I have been nothing short of humbled and ecstatic at this chance to be a part of something so important to me. It has been a profound honor to bring our world into the D&D multiverse and invite you to come play and create in it. Exandria continues to be one of my proudest achievements, with Wildemount my most accomplished aspect of this world to date. This continent is ripe with adventure and mystery. To work with such talented people to make this campaign a reality is a joy I never thought I'd get to experience. Wildemount began with {@i Critical Role}, but this book is an invitation for you and your friends to make this world your own.": "对于有机会成为对我来说如此重要的一部分，我感到无比的谦卑和欣喜。能够将我们的世界带入D&D的多元宇宙，并邀请您在其中进行游戏和创作，这是一种莫大的荣幸。埃克桑德里亚仍然是我最自豪的成就之一，而荒野山庄则是我迄今为止在这个世界上最有成就的地方。这片大陆充满了冒险和神秘感。与如此有才华的人合作，使这项活动成为现实，这是我从未想过的快乐体验。野蛮生长始于{@i Critical Role}，但这本书是对您和您的朋友的邀请，使这个世界成为您自己的世界。",
	"I invite you all to come to Wildemount. Wander the dangerous valleys of Western Wynandir, sail up and down the Menagerie Coast, brave the wastes of Xhorhas's scarred lands, and explore the ancient secrets in the regions beyond these war-embroiled realms. Follow the paths of the Mighty Nein or blaze your own trail. This is your Wildemount now.": "我邀请你们都来野人山庄。徜徉在威南迪尔西部危险的山谷中，在玛纳吉海岸上下航行，勇敢地在肖哈斯伤痕累累的荒原上前进，并探索这些被战争包围的王国之外地区的古老秘密。沿着伟大的尼恩的道路前进，或者开辟你自己的道路。这就是你的荒野山庄了。",
	"Two armies clash on a fog-shrouded battlefield, heralded by the sound of trumpets and drums on one side, and by an eerie, chirping whistle like countless thousands of wailing crickets on the other. A raven, its ebon feathers spattered with blood, alights on one of the fallen corpses and gently raps its beak on the soldier's helmet. The raven looks up, curious, and flies into the sky. A land embroiled in war expands beneath it, and yet, within the shroud of conflict, the raven sees twinkling pockets of light.": "两支军队在浓雾笼罩的战场上发生冲突，一方有号角声和鼓声，另一方有阴森恐怖的鸣笛声，像无数只哀鸣的蟋蟀。一只乌鸦，其乌黑的羽毛上溅满了鲜血，落在一具倒下的尸体上，用嘴轻轻地拍打着士兵的头盔。乌鸦好奇地抬头看了看，然后飞向天空。一片陷入战争的土地在它脚下扩张，然而，在冲突的笼罩下，乌鸦看到了闪烁的光点。",
	"The raven sees souls that shine bright with courage, kindness, and determination. It sees souls lustrous with greed, fear, and anger. And most of all, it sees souls radiating with a desire to discover their place in the world. The raven sees Wildemount.": "乌鸦看到的是闪耀着勇气、仁慈和决心的灵魂。它看到灵魂因贪婪、恐惧和愤怒而熠熠生辉。而最重要的是，它看到了散发着渴望发现自己在这个世界上的位置的灵魂。乌鸦看到了怀尔德蒙。",
	"Wildemount is a new setting for your Dungeons & Dragons campaign, originally created by Matthew Mercer as the setting for the second campaign of the hit series Critical Role. Though it's just one continent in the larger world of Exandria, Wildemount is teeming with varied cultures, locales, peoples, and monsters. It is home to both avatars of evil and paragons of good, but it is defined by the common people who exist in between these two ideals.": "Wildemount是龙与地下城活动的一个新设定，最初由Matthew Mercer创造，作为热门系列《关键角色》的第二个活动的设定。虽然它只是艾克桑德里亚这个大世界中的一块大陆，但荒野山庄却充满了各种文化、地点、民族和怪物。这里既有邪恶的化身，也有善良的典范，但它是由存在于这两种理想之间的普通人所定义。",
	"This book is for D&D players and Dungeon Masters of all experience levels. It is for newcomers and for hardcore fans of Critical Role alike. If you've watched every episode of Critical Role to date, this book will still contain surprises for you, as there are corners of Wildemount that even the Mighty Nein weren't able to explore in their adventures.": "本书是为所有经验水平的D&D玩家和地下城主准备的。它既适合新人，也适合《关键角色》的铁杆粉丝。如果你已经看了《关键角色》迄今为止的每一集，这本书仍然会给你带来惊喜，因为荒野山庄的一些角落，即使是强大的尼恩在他们的冒险中也没能探索到。",
	"If you're a Dungeon Master, this book will help you create a D&D campaign set in a land of war, intrigue, and swashbuckling adventure. You could set your campaign entirely within one of Wildemount's four regions, or you could follow the example set by Critical Role and create a campaign with a constantly evolving tone as the adventurers journey across the continent. You will also find brand-new monsters and introductory adventures that can help you start a campaign in any of Wildemount's four regions.": "如果你是一名地下城主，这本书将帮助你创建一个以战争、阴谋和冒险为背景的D&D活动。你可以将你的战役完全设置在荒野山庄的四个地区之一，或者你可以效仿《关键角色》的例子，在冒险者穿越大陆的过程中创建一个基调不断变化的战役。你还会发现全新的怪物和介绍性的冒险，可以帮助你在荒野山庄的任何一个地区开始一个活动。",
	"If you're a player, this book contains new options that will help your character fit in perfectly with this strange new land. You can use the heroic chronicle system to create a backstory that firmly roots your character in the lands of Wildemount. You'll also find new subclasses as well as new magic items that will help you attain greater and greater power as you travel the continent.": "如果你是一名玩家，本书包含的新选项将帮助你的角色完美地融入这片陌生的新土地。你可以使用英雄编年史系统来创建一个背景故事，使你的角色牢牢扎根于荒野山庄的土地上。你还会发现新的子类以及新的魔法物品，它们将帮助你在穿越大陆时获得越来越大的力量。",
	"Wildemount's various regions are described in greater detail in {@book chapter 3|EGW|4}. Here's a quick overview of the major civilizations of Wildemount.": "Wildemount的各个地区在{@book chapter 3|EGW|4}中都有更详细的描述。下面是野人山主要文明的简要介绍。",
	"The raven soars over a massive city, sprawling outward from a somber, monolithic palace. Soldiers and war machines pour from the city, stretching across the land like innumerable grasping arms, greedily encircling the continent. The raven notes this hungry behemoth and alters course.": "乌鸦在一座巨大的城市上空翱翔，从一座阴沉的巨石宫殿向外延伸。士兵和战争机器从城市中涌出，像无数的抓手一样延伸到土地上，贪婪地包围着大陆。乌鸦注意到这个饥饿的庞然大物，改变了方向。",
	"The Dwendalian Empire is a young, ambitious state borne from decades of strife in Western Wynandir—the heartland of Wildemount. Its austere lands are dotted with tiny villages, ruins of ancient civilizations, and pockets of uncharted wilderness.": "德文达尔帝国是一个年轻的、雄心勃勃的国家，它诞生于威南迪尔西部几十年的纷争之中--怀尔德蒙的中心地带。它朴素的土地上点缀着小村庄、古代文明的遗迹和小块未知的荒野。",
	"Campaigns set in the Dwendalian Empire are bound to involve elements of war and political intrigue. The empire is at war with the Kryn Dynasty, a nation of surface-dwelling drow which occupies Eastern Wynandir and the wastes of Xhorhas. This war allows various Dwendalian factions, such as the power-hungry Cerberus Assembly, to vie for political dominance.": "在德温达里亚帝国进行的战役必然会涉及战争和政治阴谋的元素。帝国正与克里恩王朝交战，克里恩王朝是一个由地表居住的乌鸦组成的国家，占据着东威南迪尔和Xhorhas的荒地。这场战争使德文达尔人的各个派别，如渴望权力的地狱犬议会，争夺政治统治权。",
	"Westward flies the herald of the Raven Queen. It bursts through the clouds above the western mountains and emerges into a land blessed by sun. A sea of lush jungle stretches out beneath the raven, until eventually green gives way to golden sand, and then to a boundless, sapphire sea. Ships swarm on that sea like a cloud of gnats, engulfed by flames and the sound of cannon fire. They fight for freedom.": "乌鸦女王的预示向西飞去。它冲破了西部山脉上方的云层，出现在一片被太阳祝福的土地上。一片郁郁葱葱的丛林在乌鸦身下延伸，直到最后绿色让位给金色的沙子，然后是一望无际的蓝宝石海。船只在海面上蜂拥而至，就像一团蚊子，被火焰和炮声所吞没。他们为自由而战。",
	"The Clovis Concord is a republic of city-states lining the Menagerie Coast, the westernmost shore of Wildemount. This tropical region is rich with history and known for a lively, free-spirited culture that contrasts sharply with Wildemount's other, politically narrow-minded nations.": "克洛维斯康科德是一个由城邦组成的共和国，沿Menagerie海岸而建，是Wildemount的最西端海岸。这个热带地区历史悠久，以活泼、自由的文化而闻名，与怀尔德蒙其他政治上狭隘的国家形成鲜明的对比。",
	"Campaigns set on the Menagerie Coast are often nautical, exploring the conflict between the law of the Clovis Concord and the chaos of the Revelry pirates. They can also investigate the jungles that line the coast and the ancient ruins hidden within their verdant boughs.": "以Menagerie海岸为背景的战役通常是航海性的，探索Clovis Concord的法律和Revelry海盗的混乱之间的冲突。他们还可以调查海岸线上的丛林和隐藏在其青翠枝叶中的古代遗迹。",
	"The raven, battered by ice and snow, sees petty warlords lead bands of slavers across the snowfields and understands that no law but power rules the north. It sees smugglers and thieves flee beyond the grasp of civilization and into the unknown. It sees the vast, roiling wilderness act with a fell will of its own, claiming the lives of those who dare attempt to grasp power beyond their ken. They fight for survival, glory, and greed.": "被冰雪打击的乌鸦看到小军阀带领着奴隶主队伍穿越雪原，明白除了权力，没有任何法律可以统治北方。它看到走私者和盗贼逃出了文明的范围，进入了未知的世界。它看到巨大的、咆哮的荒野以其自身的意志行事，夺取那些敢于尝试掌握超越其能力的人的生命。他们为生存、荣誉和贪婪而战。",
	"The Tribes of Shadycreek Run are a fragmented coalition of thieves, slavers, and scoundrels who managed to amass power in the frigid backwater of Shadycreek Run. While they struggle to enrich themselves through crime, however, they fail to realize that malign, primordial powers are creeping into the north underneath their noses.": "沙迪克流部落是一个由盗贼、奴隶主和恶棍组成的零散联盟，他们设法在沙迪克流这个寒冷的落后地区积累了权力。然而，当他们努力通过犯罪来充实自己的时候，他们没有意识到邪恶的、原始的力量正在他们的眼皮底下悄悄地进入北方。",
	"Campaigns set in the Biting North often involve morally gray characters butting heads with equally amoral organizations in a struggle to survive—and then explode into chaos as forces beyond mortal imagination make all these petty conflicts seem insignificant by comparison.": "设置在北方的战役往往涉及到道德上的灰色人物与同样不道德的组织在生存斗争中发生冲突，然后爆发出混乱，因为超出凡人想象的力量使所有这些琐碎的冲突相比之下显得微不足道。",
	"Finally, the raven flies east. It sees beings that would be slain on sight in the other civilized nations of Wildemount, walking side-by-side with humans and gray-skinned elves. The raven sees that these people have a light within them—and it sees that, far to the east, there is a mighty fortress that contains a light unseen since the dawning of the world. Here, they fight for the revelation of the end of the world.": "最后，乌鸦向东飞去。它看到那些在野人山其他文明国家会被当场杀死的生命，与人类和灰皮肤的精灵并肩而行。乌鸦看到，这些人体内有一种光，而且它看到，在遥远的东方，有一个强大的堡垒，其中有一种自世界黎明以来从未见过的光。在这里，他们为世界末日的启示而战斗。",
	"The Kryn Dynasty is an empire made up of dark elves (drow) and other humanoids typically considered to be monsters by the other nations of Wildemount, such as minotaurs, goblinkin, and gnolls. The Kryn Dynasty rules over the wastes of Xhorhas, a land once blighted by the rule of the Betrayer Gods when immortals still walked the land. The Kryn safeguard a secret; if your players haven't seen any of Critical Role, revealing this secret could mark the turning point of a campaign.": "克林王朝是一个由黑暗精灵（drow）和其他被荒野之城其他国家视为怪物的人形生物组成的帝国，例如牛头人、哥布林金和地精。克林王朝统治着Xhorhas的荒原，这片土地曾经被背叛者之神的统治所玷污，当时不朽的人还在这片土地上行走。克林人守护着一个秘密；如果你的玩家没有见过任何《关键角色》，揭示这个秘密可能会成为战役的转折点。",
	"A campaign set in Xhorhas will doubtless involve the war between the Kryn Dynasty and the Dwendalian Empire, but it can also include traditional dungeon crawls, political intrigue within the courts of the dynasty, or even wilderness exploration that could unearth secrets lost since the fall of the Betrayer Gods.": "以Xhorhas为背景的战役无疑会涉及克莱恩王朝和德文达尔帝国之间的战争，但它也可以包括传统的地牢爬行、王朝宫廷内的政治阴谋，甚至是可能发掘自背叛者之神陨落以来失去的秘密的野外探索。",
	"{@book Chapter 1|EGW|2} of this book introduces the big ideas you'll need to know before creating a campaign in Wildemount: its history and its gods.": "{@book Chapter 1|EGW|2}本书介绍了你在创建荒野山庄战役前需要知道的大概念：它的历史和它的神灵。",
	"{@book Chapter 2|EGW|3} presents the major political players that shape daily life in Wildemount: its factions and societies. Depending on the choices made by your party of adventurers, these organizations might become their allies or their enemies. Some characters might begin play with a history of involvement with one of these factions, and several backgrounds are included later on to represent this allegiance.": "{@book Chapter 2|EGW|3}介绍了影响荒野山庄日常生活的主要政治角色：它的派别和社会。根据你的冒险者队伍的选择，这些组织可能成为他们的盟友或敌人。一些角色在开始游戏时可能与这些派别中的某一派别有牵连，后面会有几个背景来代表这种效忠关系。",
	"{@book Chapter 3|EGW|4} contains the Wildemount gazetteer, which details the cities and points of interest in each of the continent's regions. The gazetteer includes NPCs, background information, and even plot hooks that you can use as the seeds of your own adventures. It also gives a brief overview of the other lands of Exandria beyond Wildemount.": "{@book Chapter 3|EGW|4}包含《荒野山庄》地名册，其中详细介绍了大陆每个地区的城市和景点。地名录包括NPC、背景信息，甚至还有情节钩子，你可以将其作为你自己冒险的种子。它还简要介绍了野人山以外的艾克珊德里亚的其他土地。",
	"{@book Chapter 4|EGW|5} is for players first and foremost; combined with the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, it contains everything you need to create a character for a Wildemount campaign.": "{@book Chapter 4|EGW|5}首先是为玩家准备的；结合{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}，它包含了你为荒野山庄活动创造一个角色所需要的一切。",
	"The final chapters of this book, {@book chapters 5|EGW|6} through {@book 7|EGW|8}, give DMs starting adventures they can use to kick off their campaigns as well as new magic items and monsters to include in adventures of their own design.": "本书的最后几章，从{@book chapters 5|EGW|6}到{@book 7|EGW|8}，为管理员提供了可以用来启动他们活动的起始冒险，以及可以在他们自己设计的冒险中包含的新魔法物品和怪物。",
	"The continent of Wildemount is a powder keg about to explode. Tensions between the Dwendalian Empire and the Kryn Dynasty have just erupted into open war, and everyone in Wildemount, including the adventurers, must contend with the fallout of the conflict between the continent's two imperial superpowers.": "怀尔德蒙大陆是一个即将爆炸的火药桶。德文达尔帝国和克里恩王朝之间的紧张关系刚刚爆发为公开的战争，怀尔德蒙的每个人，包括冒险者，都必须应对大陆上两个帝国超级大国之间的冲突所带来的影响。",
	"The war is only as important as you make it. If you place either the battles of the war or their consequences front and center, the war will be of chief concern to your players. If you keep the war and its consequences distant, then the characters will be free to interact with or ignore the war as they see fit. With a little bit of creative tweaking of the setting, you could create a Wildemount campaign where the war has been called off or never even happened!": "战争的重要性只取决于你的决定。如果你把战争的战斗或其后果放在前面和中心位置，那么战争就会成为玩家的主要关切。如果你把战争和它的后果放在遥远的地方，那么角色们就可以自由地与战争互动或忽略它，因为他们认为合适。只要对设定进行一点创造性的调整，你就可以创造出一个野人山庄的战役，在那里，战争已经被取消了，或者甚至从来没有发生过！这就是野人山庄。",
	"If you want the war to be an important part of your campaign, you need to give your players a reason for their characters to care about it. The easiest way to get buy-in from your players is to discuss out-of-character how big of a factor they want war to be in this campaign. You can even dial the importance of the war up and down over the course of the campaign, depending on how you and your players feel over time.": "如果你想让战争成为战役的重要组成部分，你需要给你的玩家一个让他们的角色关心战争的理由。获得玩家支持的最简单的方法是，在角色之外讨论他们希望战争在这场战役中成为多大的因素。你甚至可以在活动过程中，根据你和你的玩家的感受，调高或调低战争的重要性。",
	"If you and your players find war to be dramatic and compelling, urge your players to create characters with strong ties to the conflict. For example, patriotic (or even jingoistic) characters will always fight for king or queen and country. Likewise, greedy characters will fight for profit and glory. Once they've given you their reasons, turn those motivations into plot points in your campaign.": "如果你和你的玩家认为战争具有戏剧性和吸引力，那么就敦促你的玩家创造与冲突有密切联系的角色。例如，爱国主义（甚至是金戈铁马）的角色总是为国王或女王和国家而战。同样，贪婪的角色会为了利益和荣耀而战。一旦他们给了你他们的理由，就把这些动机变成你活动中的情节点。",
	"The adventurers don't have to be active combatants for the war to affect their lives. See below for a list of adventure options that touch on the consequences of war without directly involving mass warfare.": "冒险者不一定要成为积极的战斗人员，战争才会影响他们的生活。请看下面涉及战争后果而又不直接涉及大规模战争的冒险选项清单。",
	"If you want the war to be completely absent, simply dial the timeline back by a year, or even just a few months. All the political tensions between the Dwendalian Empire and the Kryn Dynasty still exist, but now they're just simmering instead of at a full boil.": "如果你想让战争完全消失，只需将时间线往后拨一年，甚至只是几个月。德文达尔帝国和克莱恩王朝之间的所有政治紧张关系仍然存在，但现在它们只是在酝酿，而不是完全沸腾。",
	"Not all campaigns set in Wildemount need to deal with the war directly. That is, the characters aren't expected to conscript with one army or another, or even serve as mercenaries. The effects of war are far-reaching and multifarious, and loose-cannon adventurers are the perfect people to get involved in the countless conflicts sparked by war. These schemes could include:": "并非所有在荒野山庄的活动都需要直接处理战争。也就是说，人物不需要征召到某支军队，甚至不需要充当雇佣兵。战争的影响是深远而多变的，而松散的冒险者是参与战争引发的无数冲突的最佳人选。这些计划可能包括",
	"In times of war, criminals and smugglers take advantage of lax law enforcement. Petty criminals and crime syndicates like the Myriad will need help moving illicit goods in and out of Dwendalian and Xhorhasian cities, and Revelry pirates will need loyal crew members to raid unprotected towns.": "在战争时期，犯罪分子和走私者会利用执法不严的情况。像迈瑞德（Myriad）这样的小罪犯和犯罪集团将需要帮助将非法货物运入和运出德文达尔（Dwendalian）和霍哈斯（Xhorhasian）的城市，而瑞弗里（Revelry）海盗将需要忠诚的船员来袭击没有保护的城镇。",
	"When a town is destroyed by advancing armies, or by a landslide caused by artillery, the common folk need help escaping. This could involve escorting noncombatants through no-man's-land to a nearby town, or carving out a new settlement from the wilds.": "当一个城镇被前进的军队摧毁，或者被大炮造成的山体滑坡摧毁时，老百姓需要帮助他们逃跑。这可能涉及到护送非战斗人员穿过无人区到附近的城镇，或从荒野中开辟一个新的定居点。",
	"When officers of the law are conscripted as soldiers, local lawmasters suddenly find themselves in need of mercenary aid. Lawful characters might find great adventure in flushing criminals out of cities and busting their wilderness hideaways.": "当法律官员被征召为士兵时，当地的执法者突然发现他们需要雇佣兵的帮助。合法的角色可能会在将罪犯赶出城市和捣毁他们的野外藏身处时发现巨大的冒险。",
	"Obviously, characters can choose to join up with one of the sides in this conflict to embark on missions and take orders from a commanding officer. This is a good option if you want to run an episodic campaign, where most game sessions begin with a stated mission that the players must accomplish and ends with a reward and another mission.": "很明显，角色可以选择加入这场冲突中的某一方，开始执行任务并接受指挥官的命令。如果你想开展一个情节性的战役，这是一个很好的选择，大多数游戏环节以玩家必须完成的既定任务开始，以奖励和另一个任务结束。",
	"The explosions of artillery and the pounding of boots against the plains can spook monsters, and invasions can cause even powerful monsters such as giants and dragons to flee their lairs. Whenever an upheaval occurs, soldiers and commoners alike find their lives in danger—and only adventurers can deal with the threat.": "大炮的爆炸声和靴子对平原的敲击声会惊动怪物，而入侵甚至会导致强大的怪物如巨人和龙逃离它们的巢穴。每当动乱发生时，士兵和平民都会发现他们的生命处于危险之中--只有冒险家才能应对这种威胁。",
	"Like the crime syndicates, opportunistic traders know that war is a chance to become rich. Adventurers are the perfect pawns for trade barons looking to sell high-value goods, especially if they have to cross dangerous land to reach their buyers.": "像犯罪集团一样，投机取巧的商人知道战争是发财的机会。冒险家是希望出售高价值货物的贸易大亨们的完美棋子，尤其是当他们不得不穿越危险的土地来接触他们的买家时。",
	"If there's one thing D&D adventurers hate, it's being told what to do, but serving in an army is all about following orders. It's up to the Dungeon Master to make sure the characters are aware of what they're getting into if they decide to enlist. Similarly, if you force your players to join a military unit and then discover that the characters actually want to go on self-directed adventures without a commanding officer ordering them around, you and your players should talk out-of-game to figure out a way to turn the campaign around.": "如果说D&D的冒险者有什么讨厌的事情，那就是被告知该做什么，但是在军队中服役就是要服从命令。地下城管理员应该确保角色在决定参军时知道他们要做什么。同样，如果你强迫你的玩家加入一个军事单位，然后发现这些角色实际上想在没有指挥官命令的情况下进行自主冒险，那么你和你的玩家应该在游戏外进行讨论，以找出扭转战役的方法。",
	"Since D&D is primarily a game about a small group of characters going on adventures alone, it can be difficult to simulate massive battles using D&D combat rules. Because of this, it's generally best to keep the characters away from mass battles. However, huge conflicts with thousands of combatants are a cornerstone of epic fantasy, and your players might be disappointed if your war campaign doesn't have at least one climactic battle.": "由于D&D主要是一个关于一小群角色单独冒险的游戏，因此使用D&D的战斗规则来模拟大规模的战斗是很困难的。正因为如此，一般来说，最好让角色远离大规模战斗。然而，拥有数千名战斗人员的巨大冲突是史诗般的幻想的基石，如果你的战争活动没有至少一场高潮迭起的战斗，你的玩家可能会感到失望。",
	"To solve this problem, you can break down your mass combat into manageable chunks. Find a significant location that the characters can either defend or conquer with minimal reinforcements, like an overrun citadel. Then, have the major battle proceed in waves that guide the characters from one cinematic encounter to another. You can think of these encounters like rooms in a dungeon; some rooms have multiple doors that the characters can choose from, while others only have a single passage.": "为了解决这个问题，你可以把你的大规模战斗分解成可管理的小块。找到一个重要的地点，让角色可以用最少的援军来保卫或征服它，比如一个被占领的城堡。然后，让主要的战斗一波接一波地进行，引导人物从一个电影式的遭遇战到另一个。你可以把这些遭遇想成是地牢里的房间；有些房间有多个门，人物可以选择，而其他房间只有一个通道。",
	"For example, after capturing the ruined fortress, the characters learn that a garrison of soldiers has arrived to help hold onto the fort, and the characters are needed elsewhere on the battlefield. You could present them with just a single urgent target, such as an enemy warlord, or you could offer them options, such as three different allied battalions under attack.": "例如，在占领了废墟要塞后，角色们得知有一支驻军赶来帮助坚守要塞，而战场上的其他地方也需要角色们。你可以只向他们提出一个紧急目标，比如一个敌军军阀，也可以为他们提供选择，比如三个不同的盟军营受到攻击。",
	"If you need to depict a lot of both allied and hostile NPCs battling in the same encounter as the players, you can simplify the encounter by ignoring dice rolls entirely and deciding when a creature dies based on your own instinct. This can work once in a while, but try to avoid doing this all the time, since seeing you simply decide the result of combat without dice can damage the believability of your game world.": "如果你需要描写大量的盟友和敌对的NPC与玩家在同一个遭遇战中作战，你可以通过完全忽略骰子的滚动来简化遭遇战，根据你自己的直觉来决定一个生物何时死亡。这种做法偶尔会奏效，但要尽量避免一直这样做，因为看到你在没有骰子的情况下简单地决定战斗的结果会损害你的游戏世界的可信度。",
	"This book is set in a certain moment in the history of Wildemount, and thus setting a campaign in a different era—or even in a different decade—could make some information in the gazetteer invalid. The present year is 835 PD (\"Post-Divergence\"). The history of Wildemount is described in more detail in {@book chapter 1|EGW|2}.": "本书的背景是怀德蒙历史上的某个时刻，因此将战役设定在不同的时代--甚至是不同的十年--可能会使地名录中的一些信息失效。现在的年份是835 PD（\"后分歧\"）。Wildemount的历史在{@book chapter 1|EGW|2}中有更详细的描述。",
	"From a real-world perspective, this book is set at a certain point during the adventures of the Mighty Nein in {@i Critical Role}'s second campaign. Thus, the point at which the adventures you create using this book diverge from canon is at episode 50 of campaign 2. That's okay! Look at it another way: by creating your own Wildemount adventures, you are boldly creating your own canon, from which all the events of {@i Critical Role} diverge into myth and rumor.": "从现实世界的角度来看，这本书的背景是在{@i Critical Role}的第二次战役中强大的尼恩的冒险中的某个点。因此，你用这本书创建的冒险与正统的冒险相背离的时间点是在第二次战役的第50集。换个角度看：通过创造你自己的野人山庄冒险，你就大胆地创造了你自己的正统，从这里开始，{@i Critical Role}的所有事件都会变成神话和谣言。",
	"Keeping track of time using the Exandrian calendar can make your game world seem more realistic. It can also allow you to align game sessions with important in-game dates, such as holidays.

Catha is considered to be intrinsically tied to Sehanine, the Moon Weaver, and is regarded by some as a creation of the Moon Weaver to watch over the just and hide those who require obfuscation. Ruidus, the second moon of Exandria, is much smaller and farther away. With a slower rotation around the world and dark red-brown coloring, Ruidus is often difficult to see among the stars of the night sky and nearly impossible to spot during the day. Little is known of Ruidis, though older cultures and texts speak of it as an omen of ill tidings, or even a remnant of a Betrayer God plot left abandoned and unrealized.": "埃克桑德里亚有两颗已知的卫星，围绕着这个星球运行。Catha是其中较大和较近的一颗卫星，是夜间旅行的预兆，在天空中闪耀着明亮的白色。Catha被认为与织月者Sehanine有着内在的联系，并被一些人认为是织月者的创造物，用于监视正义者并隐藏那些需要混淆视听的人。雷杜斯（Ruidus）是艾克桑德里亚的第二颗卫星，要小得多，也远得多。围绕世界的旋转速度较慢，颜色为深红褐色，Ruidus在夜空的星星中往往很难看到，在白天几乎不可能发现。人们对Ruidis知之甚少，尽管古老的文化和文本将它说成是不祥的预兆，甚至是被遗弃的、未实现的背叛者上帝阴谋的残余。",

	"Life ever seeks to understand its inception. Every civilization has its own interpretation of where its story began. Even within the world of Exandria, different cultures have creation myths that eventually converge with recorded history, but there is no universally accepted story. Even so, the ancient city of Vasselheim on the distant continent of Othanzia is largely considered to be the oldest surviving city, having endured a terrible war that wiped out most of civilization nearly a thousand years ago. Vasselheim houses the earliest known temples to the gods, as well as the earliest known records of history that survived this catastrophic war.": "生命一直在寻求了解它的起源。每个文明都对自己的故事开始的地方有自己的解释。即使在埃克桑德里亚的世界里，不同的文化都有创世神话，并最终与有记载的历史相融合，但没有一个普遍接受的故事。即便如此，遥远的奥坦西亚大陆上的瓦瑟海姆古城在很大程度上被认为是现存最古老的城市，它经历了一场可怕的战争，在近千年前消灭了大部分的文明。瓦瑟海姆拥有已知最早的神庙，以及在这场灾难性战争中幸存的最早的历史记录。",

	"Long ago, this world was one of tumultuous and chaotic forces, naught but unbridled fires and churning, jagged rock. Through the ashen skies of Creation Primordial, the gods came from beyond the ether, new and formless. Looking on this roiling realm, they saw potential for great beauty, great strength, and the chance to learn their own place in creation.": "很久以前，这个世界是一个动荡和混乱的力量，除了肆意的火焰和汹涌的锯齿状岩石，什么都没有。穿过原始创造的灰暗天空，众神从乙醚之外来到这里，新的和无形的。观察着这个沸腾的领域，他们看到了巨大的美丽和强大的潜力，并有机会了解自己在创造中的地位。",
	"Thus, divine hands birthed the First Children, the elves, who embodied beauty and grace, to walk the verdant Green and know the music of the Blue. A second creation was wrought: the dwarves, a hearty people intent on taming the land, filled with the craft and invention of the divinity beyond the ashen void. A third people were given life: the humans, endowed with hearts of passion that burned as brightly as their spans of life were short, and infused with the need to celebrate and laugh.": "因此，神圣的双手孕育了第一批孩子，即精灵，他们体现了美丽和优雅，行走在青翠的绿色中，了解蓝色的音乐。第二个创造是：矮人，一个打算驯服土地的健壮民族，充满了灰暗虚空之外的神性的工艺和发明。第三个民族被赋予了生命：人类，被赋予了热情的心，他们的生命燃烧得很旺盛，而他们的寿命却很短，并且被注入了庆祝和欢笑的需要。",
	"Other creations followed as the many races of Exandria were given form from the boundless inspiration the of the protean gods. These Children of Creation walked the land and, as their knowledge grew, attempted to build on it. But the land was fierce and treacherous, and the children were dashed on the rocks and consumed by the elements. Sorrow filled the hearts of the gods as these first races struggled against a land that did not want them, and the children looked to their creators for guidance and protection. Thus, the gods gave to them gifts, lending their own power to their children to create and shape the world around them; these were the first divine magics.": "随着埃克桑德里亚的众多种族从保护神的无尽灵感中被赋予形式，其他的创造也随之而来。这些创造之子在这片土地上行走，随着他们知识的增长，试图在这片土地上进行建设。但这块土地凶猛而诡谲，孩子们被砸在岩石上，被元素所吞噬。诸神的心中充满了悲伤，因为这些最初的种族正在与一片不需要他们的土地斗争，孩子们期待着他们的创造者的指导和保护。因此，诸神给了他们礼物，把自己的力量借给他们的孩子，以创造和塑造他们周围的世界；这些是最早的神术。",
	"With these magics, the various peoples learned to bend the angry earth to their will: to temper the flames that burst through the ground, to tame the floods that threatened their abundance, and to turn seedling into fruit and beast into meal. Language became commonplace, culture was born, and governance replaced anarchy. The protean creators, the divinity beyond the ashen skies, saw progress and saw that it was good, yet fragile and in need of guardians.": "有了这些魔法，各族人民学会了让愤怒的大地屈服于他们的意志：缓和冲破地面的火焰，驯服威胁他们丰收的洪水，并把幼苗变成果实，把野兽变成食物。语言变得普遍，文化诞生了，治理取代了无政府状态。保护性的创造者，灰暗天空之外的神性，看到了进步，看到了它是好的，但也是脆弱的，需要守护者。",
	"Thus were born the First Protectors: the Dragons Metallic of Exandria, who safeguarded the gentler races. The realm grew quieter, the people multiplied, and new beings were given form and life. As culture grew, and the people further understood the world around them, they also looked up to their creators and gave them worship, gave them form, gave them title and purpose.": "因此，第一批保护者诞生了：Exandria的龙族金属人，他们保护着温和的种族。这个王国越来越安静，人们越来越多，新的生物被赋予了形式和生命。随着文化的发展，人们进一步了解他们周围的世界，他们也仰望着他们的创造者，给他们以崇拜，给他们以形式，给他们以称号和目的。",
	"But this realm did not wish to be tamed. Quaking cliffs roared in defiance. Seas swelled and swallowed. Flames erupted from the land. Beneath the elements, unknown to the Creators beyond the ashen skies, lived ancient beings who had already claimed this world as their home: the Primordials. These great elemental titans that once dwelt deep within the world now rose from their unseen domain to sunder the land once more. The gods watched as their children, their joy, were flung against the broken rocks or fed to formless terrors unleashed by the destruction. Demonic entities spilled from the umbra of the Abyss to feast on the carnage, called forth by the violence and released to pick the carrion clean.": "但这个王国并不希望被驯服。颤抖的悬崖发出蔑视的吼声。海水涌动并吞噬。火焰从土地上喷发出来。在这些元素之下，在灰暗的天空之外，创造者们不知道，生活着古老的生命，他们已经声称这个世界是他们的家：原始人。这些曾经居住在世界深处的伟大的元素巨头，现在从他们看不见的领域中站起来，再次分裂了这片土地。诸神看着他们的孩子，他们的欢乐，被扔到破碎的岩石上，或者被喂给毁灭所释放的无形的恐怖。恶魔的实体从深渊的保护罩中溢出，在这场大屠杀中大快朵颐，它们被暴力所召唤，被释放出来，将腐肉采摘干净。",
	"Some gods were so full of grief and anger that they wished to leave this world behind and start anew. They tried to convince their divine kindred to join with the Primordials, allowing chaos to reclaim the realm. Other gods wished to remain and subdue the Primordials, to tame the land for the sake of their creations. Thus was created a divide among the gods. Celestial sentinels once dedicated to battling the chaotic forces of the Abyss now fell to hate and tyranny, forging new hells under a fallen angel now claiming lordship over all the realms of sulfur and brimstone.": "一些神明充满了悲伤和愤怒，他们希望离开这个世界，重新开始。他们试图说服他们的神族与原始人结合，让混沌重新获得这个领域。其他神灵则希望留下并制服原始人，为了他们的创造物驯服这片土地。因此，诸神之间产生了分歧。曾经致力于与深渊的混乱力量作斗争的天体哨兵现在倒向了仇恨和暴政，在一个堕落天使的领导下建立了新的地狱，现在声称是所有硫磺和硫磺界的主宰。",
	"The Creators that remained, wishing to salvage their home, their creations, and their realized selves, were forced to take up arms and learn to protect that which they valued most. They organized their followers and taught them how to draw from the powers of creation on their own: to build, to change, and to destroy, all without the aid of divine power. Mortals learned to defend themselves through practices such as alchemy or by bending the very fabrics of existence, though on a smaller scale than that of their creators.": "留下来的创造者，希望挽救他们的家园、他们的创造物和他们实现的自我，被迫拿起武器，学习保护他们最珍视的东西。他们组织了自己的追随者，并教他们如何从自己的创造物中汲取力量：建造、改变和破坏，所有这些都不需要神力的帮助。凡人学会了通过炼金术等做法来保护自己，或者通过弯曲存在的结构来保护自己，尽管规模比他们的创造者要小。",
	"This gift was the knowledge of arcane magic, which the good children used to drive away their traitorous kin, banish the turned Creators to their own prison-like planes, and ultimately destroy the Primordials, scattering the chaotic elements to their own planes of existence. The world was at peace for the first time since its creation, and the first real civilization took root and grew into a grand city called Vasselheim. The Cradle of Creation. The Dawn City.": "这份礼物是关于奥术的知识，好孩子们用它赶走了他们的叛徒亲戚，把变异的创造者驱逐到他们自己的监狱般的星球上，并最终摧毁了原始人，把混乱的元素分散到他们自己的存在星球上。世界自创世以来第一次处于和平状态，第一个真正的文明扎根于此，并成长为一个名为瓦塞尔海姆的宏伟城市。创造的摇篮。黎明之城。",
	"Culture developed anew, the races ventured forth to discover and explore their own lands, and great music filled the air to give a name to this world once and for all: Exandria.": "文化得以重新发展，各族人民勇于发现和探索自己的土地，伟大的音乐在空气中弥漫，为这个世界永远地命名了。艾克桑德里亚。",
	"Over time, some of the people of Exandria grew arrogant. Seeing their arcane gifts as proof that the gods held no sway over their fate, a belief developed that, with enough understanding, they too could become as powerful as the gods. Many began to shun faith in favor of their own pursuits. Though this hurt and surprised the Creators, they understood the willfulness of their children and endured out of love and hope for redemption.": "随着时间的推移，埃克桑德里亚的一些人变得傲慢起来。他们把自己的奥术天赋看作是诸神无法左右他们命运的证明，于是产生了一种信念，认为只要有足够的理解力，他们也可以变得和诸神一样强大。许多人开始回避信仰，支持他们自己的追求。虽然这让创世主感到痛苦和惊讶，但他们理解他们孩子的任性，并出于爱和对救赎的希望而忍耐着。",
	"Great kingdoms sprung up across Exandria. Castles were built in a day, accelerated by the arcanists' newfound power. Erudite cities hovered and drifted through the skies, shifting under the direction of scholarly magi to wherever their interests took them. Even though magic could be used to complete the most difficult tasks with hitherto unknown speed, magic-users strove always to innovate. As mages practiced and perfected their powers of creation, they soon unlocked the secrets of life itself, giving birth to wondrous, dangerous new creatures and power. Powerful archmages such as Vecna the Whispered One and Halas Lutagran began to carve their paths into history during this era of unbridled magical experimentation.": "伟大的王国在埃克桑德里亚各地兴起。在奥术师新发现的力量的推动下，城堡在一天之内建成。博学者的城市在天空中盘旋和漂移，在学者型魔法师的指挥下，他们的兴趣所在就会转移。尽管魔法可以被用来以前所未有的速度完成最困难的任务，但魔法使用者一直在努力创新。随着法师们练习和完善他们的创造能力，他们很快就解开了生命本身的秘密，诞生了奇妙的、危险的新生物和力量。强大的大法师，如低语者韦克纳和哈拉斯-卢塔格兰，在这个肆无忌惮的魔法实验时代开始在历史上刻下他们的足迹。",
	"The advent of the arcane seemed to be the key to a bountiful age of plenty but also proved to threaten it, as prosperity soon gave way to greed. Petty squabbles erupted over resources and wealth among the elite, while the rumor of immortality through perfected arcanum began to drive the greatest mages wild with a lust for unending power. One mortal mage, her name either lost or struck from history, crafted now-forbidden rites to challenge the God of Death, felling him and taking his place among the pantheon, making her the first and only mortal to ascend to godhood. The archmage Vespin Chloras was inspired by this display. Driven by his hunger, he sought the guidance and power of the banished gods, rending open the gates of their prisons and releasing the betrayers into the mortal world.": "奥术的出现似乎是通往富足时代的关键，但也被证明是对它的威胁，因为繁荣很快让位于贪婪。精英们为了争夺资源和财富爆发了小规模的争吵，而通过完善的奥术实现不朽的传言开始让最伟大的法师们疯狂地追求无尽的力量。有一个凡人法师，她的名字要么已经消失，要么已经从历史中抹去，她制作了现在被禁止的仪式来挑战死亡之神，杀死了他并在万神殿中占据了他的位置，使她成为第一个也是唯一一个升为神的凡人。大法师维斯平-克洛拉斯受到了这次展示的启发。在饥饿的驱使下，他寻求被放逐的诸神的指导和力量，打开了他们监狱的大门，将背叛者释放到凡间。",
	"During their imprisonment, these gods of hatred and despair twisted their prison into their own image, spawning unthinkable horrors that lived only to transform peace into suffering, and righteousness into arrogance and greed. The Nine Hells and the Abyss began to push their way into Creation. The Betrayer Gods and their hateful children discovered a world unspoiled, save for the avarice of mortals. The urge to ruin was now replaced with the desire to dominate, and the Betrayer Gods began by turning on the mage who freed them, making Archmage Vespin their first thrall. This corrupted divinity sought out the remnants of their offspring, scattered across the world, and created a mighty and terrible new kingdom on the plains of Xhorhas, at the far end of the world from Vasselheim—Ghor Dranas.": "在监禁期间，这些仇恨和绝望之神将他们的监狱扭曲成他们自己的形象，催生出难以想象的恐怖，他们活着只是为了将和平变成痛苦，将正义变成傲慢和贪婪。九层地狱和深渊开始向创世组织推进。背叛者诸神和他们可恨的孩子们发现了一个未受污染的世界，除了凡人的贪婪。毁灭的冲动现在被统治的欲望所取代，背叛者诸神开始背叛释放他们的法师，使大法师维斯平成为他们的第一个傀儡。这个堕落的神祗寻找他们散落在世界各地的后代的残余，并在Xhorhas平原上建立了一个强大而可怕的新王国，在世界的尽头，离Vasselheim-Ghor Dranas很远。",
	"In this land of evil, where the twisted power of the lower planes seeped into Exandria, the lords of darkness tainted the minds of mortals, hungrily welcoming those who had lost their way, and offering great promises and boons to hearts easily swayed. These poisonous seeds found fertile ground in the hearts of mortals obsessed with the unlimited power of the arcane. With a legion of the damned behind them, the Betrayer Gods soon made their presence known to the world with an assault on Vasselheim itself.": "在这片邪恶的土地上，下层世界扭曲的力量渗入了埃克桑德里亚，黑暗的领主们玷污了凡人的思想，他们饥渴地欢迎那些迷失方向的人，并向容易动摇的心提供巨大的承诺和恩惠。这些有毒的种子在痴迷于奥术的无限力量的凡人心中找到了肥沃的土壤。背叛者之神在他们身后有一个被诅咒的军团，他们很快就向世界表明了他们的存在，对瓦塞尔海姆本身进行了攻击。",
	"Though much of the city was reduced to rubble, Vasselheim weathered the initial assault, saved by the intervention of the Prime Deities themselves, who descended to trade blows with their former brethren. The battle between divinity and mortals, between heroes and demons, raged ceaselessly for twenty days and nights until the dark forces, their surprise attack thwarted, were finally forced to retreat.": "虽然城市的大部分都变成了废墟，但瓦塞尔海姆还是经受住了最初的攻击，由于主神们的干预，他们亲自下凡与他们以前的兄弟们交手，从而拯救了他们。神性与凡人之间的战斗，英雄与恶魔之间的战斗，无休止地持续了20个昼夜，直到黑暗势力的突袭受挫，最终被迫撤退。",
	"Evil was repulsed momentarily, but with the revelation of such a terrible foe, a dangerous arcane arms race began. Trust was shattered indefinitely: if mortals could fall under the sway of the Betrayer Gods, who was an ally? If ruin like this could be unleashed under the watchful eyes of the gods, how were they relevant? Not trusting any but themselves, the self-interested and singular humans reforged their instruments of celebration into instruments of incredible power—artifacts that could be wielded by worthy heroes. The dwarves' fascination with rock and earth turned toward isolation as they burrowed deeper into the mountains, using their divine gifts to animate legions of autonomous golems to protect their ancestral halls. Elves used their understanding of creation's beauty and intricacies to weave spells of unimaginable destructive force, the likes of which Exandria had never seen before.": "邪恶暂时被击退了，但随着这样一个可怕敌人的出现，一场危险的奥术军备竞赛开始了。信任被无限期地打破了：如果凡人可以落入背叛者诸神的控制之下，那么谁是盟友？如果这样的毁灭能在众神的注视下被释放出来，那么他们又有什么意义？除了他们自己，他们不相信任何人，自利的、单一的人类将他们的庆祝工具重新锻造成具有难以置信的力量的工具--可以由有价值的英雄挥舞的神器。矮人对岩石和泥土的迷恋转向了与世隔绝，他们把自己的神赐之物用于激活自主戈壁军团，以保护他们的祖先大厅。精灵们利用他们对造物之美的理解和错综复杂的关系，编织出具有难以想象的破坏力的法术，艾克桑德里亚从未见过这样的法术。",
	"For the first time since the Primordials were destroyed, the focus of magic was warfare. The gods themselves agreed to join their children on the field of battle, descending from the heavens to take up arms once more for the war now referred to as the Calamity.": "自原始人被摧毁以来，魔法的焦点第一次变成了战争。诸神自己也同意在战场上加入他们的孩子，从天而降，再次拿起武器参加现在被称为 \"灾祸 \"的战争。",
	"The battlefields of the catastrophic showdowns of the Calamity were scattered across Exandria, but it was Wynandir that suffered the full destructive powers of the gods. Divided by the Ashkeeper Peaks, the fields of Wynandir were once home to several powerful ruling houses, squabbling over their own goals before being drawn into either side of the conflict of the gods, or abstaining for their own reasons. The immensity of power wielded by the Prime Deities and Betrayer Gods was enough to wound the landscape for eons, and the irresponsible use of arcane knowledge developed by the mortals ensured the ruin of their own legacy.": "灾难性决斗的战场散布在艾克桑德里亚，但威南迪尔却遭受了诸神的全部破坏性力量。怀南迪尔的田野被阿什守卫者山峰分割开来，曾经是几个强大的统治家族的家园，在被卷入诸神冲突的任何一方之前，他们为自己的目标争吵不休，或者因为自己的原因而弃权不干。主神和背叛者诸神所挥舞的巨大力量足以让这片土地伤痕累累，而凡人对奥术知识的不负责任的使用则确保了他们自身遗产的毁灭。",
	"Little record remains of the terrible war, but its effects are still felt today. The sheer magnitude of the energies unleashed in the ensuing battles by gods and mortals alike was enough to fray the boundaries holding back the elemental chaos, spilling unbridled destruction into the world. It completely rearranged the known flow of magical ley energy across Exandria. The dark kingdom of Ghor Dranas was reduced to ash, but the conflict devastated Exandria's peoples, razing entire cities and inspiring in many a desire to flee from this plane of existence entirely. So great was the loss of life during the war that historians believe no more than a third of Exandria's population survived, leaving only one remaining bastion of civilization: the Dawn City, Vasselheim.": "这场可怕的战争几乎没有留下任何记录，但其影响至今仍能感受到。在随后的战斗中，诸神和凡人所释放出的能量之大，足以破坏阻挡元素混乱的边界，将肆无忌惮的毁灭洒向世界。它完全重新安排了整个埃克桑德里亚已知的魔法雷电能量的流动。古尔-德拉纳斯的黑暗王国化为灰烬，但这场冲突摧毁了埃克桑德里亚的人民，夷平了整个城市，激发了许多人完全逃离这个存在平面的愿望。战争中的生命损失是如此之大，以至于历史学家认为艾克桑德里亚的人口中只有三分之一的人幸存下来，只剩下一个文明的堡垒：黎明之城，瓦瑟海姆。",
	"The world entered a long, dark period of regrowth. The Betrayer Gods were banished once more to their realms of deception and hate, but the threat of their return weighed heavily on the world. The Prime Deities felt that their involvement in mortal conflict was to blame for the cataclysmic damage inflicted on Exandria. They knew that while the divine gateways were left open, the prison planes that held the banished Betrayers would remain imperfect and temporary.": "世界进入了一个漫长而黑暗的再生期。背叛者诸神再次被放逐到他们的欺骗和仇恨领域，但他们回来的威胁对这个世界造成了沉重的负担。主神们认为，他们参与了凡人的冲突，是对埃克桑德里亚造成的灾难性破坏的责任。他们知道，虽然神圣的通道是开放的，但关押被放逐的背叛者的监狱平面仍然是不完善和暂时的。",
	"Thus, hoping to ensure that such ruin would not befall Exandria again, they left their children to fend for themselves. The Creators returned to their own realms, dragging both Betrayer and abomination with them and sealing the pathways to the mortal realm behind them with the Divine Gate. Only in this way could they prevent their corrupted brethren from physically returning to the material plane. Sadly, for the Prime Deities, this action also carried with it a self-imposed sentence of exile. The Creators would henceforth never be allowed to visit their creation.": "因此，他们希望确保这样的毁灭不会再次降临到埃克桑德里亚，就把他们的孩子留给了自己照顾。创造者们回到了他们自己的领域，拖着背叛者和憎恶，用神门封住了他们身后通往凡人世界的通道。只有这样，他们才能阻止他们被腐蚀的兄弟们回到物质界。可悲的是，对于主神来说，这一行动也带来了一个自我放逐的判决。创造者们从此将不被允许访问他们的创造物。",
	"The disappearance of the gods is known by many names: the Second Spark for those who study the arcane, and the Penance for those who seek closeness to their gods. The most common name for this time of warfare and divine separation is the Divergence, and it marked the end of the Age of Arcanum.": "众神的消失有很多名字：研究奥术的人叫 \"第二火花\"，寻求与神灵亲近的人叫 \"忏悔\"。这段战乱和神灵分离的时期最常见的名字是分歧，它标志着奥术时代的结束。",
	"Much time has passed since, and the world has been reborn once again. The gods still influence and guide from beyond the Divine Gate, bestowing knowledge and power on their worshipers, but the path of mortals is now their own to make. New cities, kingdoms, and cultures have retaken the world, building over the ashes of the old. New songs fill the air, and the hope of a brighter future drives people day after day, while buried ruins and ancient relics remind all people of a darker time of mistakes that should never be repeated.": "自此以后，许多时间过去了，世界再次重生。诸神仍然在神门之外影响和引导，将知识和力量赋予他们的崇拜者，但凡人的道路现在由他们自己来决定。新的城市、王国和文化已经重新占领了世界，在旧的灰烬上建设。新的歌曲充斥着空气，对更光明的未来的希望日复一日地驱使着人们，而被埋葬的废墟和古老的遗迹则提醒所有的人，一个更黑暗的时代的错误永远不应该被重复。",
	"In the wake of the vast destruction of the Calamity and the exile of the pantheon in the Divergence, the survivors began to emerge from the ash and shadows to reclaim and rebuild Exandria. Across the continents, many took the pieces of their cultures and sought a place to forge a new age. This tome focuses on the rebirth of the deeply scarred land now known as Wildemount, the site of the most terrible conflicts of the Calamity, where the echoes of those deadly battles linger to this day.": "在灾难的巨大破坏和万神殿在分歧中被放逐之后，幸存者开始从灰烬和阴影中走出来，重新获得并重建艾克桑德里亚。在各大洲，许多人带着他们文化的碎片，寻找一个地方来打造一个新时代。这本小册子着重介绍了现在被称为荒野山庄的那片伤痕累累的土地的重生，这里是灾变中最可怕的冲突的发生地，那些致命的战斗的回声至今仍在那里徘徊。",
	"After the Calamity, the lands of Wildemount became wild and perilous, filled with monstrosities and beasts that prowled its broken fields and shattered mountains. The land's new denizens reclaimed the newly untamed realm, hunting any mortals not clever enough to hide. The masterless creations of the Betrayer Gods ruled their own territories, establishing themselves as a new pantheon.": "灾难过后，荒野山庄的土地变得狂野而危险，充满了怪兽和野兽，在破碎的田野和破碎的山脉中游荡。这片土地上的新居民开垦了新的未被驯服的领域，猎杀任何不够聪明的凡人来躲避。背叛者诸神的无主创造物统治着他们自己的领土，建立了自己的新神殿。",
	"As the dust settled, surviving mortals grasped at what they could from their bygone lives and hid away in fear of what would come next. Those of faith dealt with their sense of failure and abandonment, while enlightened scribes mourned the loss of their research and the great magical secrets that had enabled the previous age to rise to such prominence.": "随着尘埃落定，幸存的凡人从他们过去的生活中抓住了他们可以抓住的东西，并因害怕接下来会发生什么而躲藏起来。那些有信仰的人处理他们的失败和被遗弃感，而开明的文士们则哀悼他们的研究和伟大的魔法秘密的损失，这些秘密使前一个时代能够如此突出。",
	"Others picked up what they could from the ruins and chose to start anew, hoping that their descendants would learn from their mistakes. Over those early centuries, the scattered survivors fought back the terrors that stalked the abandoned lands of Wildemount, continuing to endure and build new societies, civilizations that eventually reclaimed Wildemount and brought the world to this modern age.": "其他人则从废墟中捡起他们能捡到的东西，选择重新开始，希望他们的后代能从他们的错误中吸取教训。在那些早期的几个世纪里，分散的幸存者抵抗着徘徊在荒野山庄废弃土地上的恐怖，继续忍受并建立新的社会，这些文明最终夺回了荒野山庄，并将世界带到了这个现代时代。",
	"The lands of Western Wynandir were the epicenter of the Calamity's destruction. Rocky ranges of mountains were sundered, entire landscapes burned, and hovering seats of power crashed down from the sky, their floating cities consumed beneath the hungry earth.": "西部威南迪尔的土地是这场灾难破坏的中心。绵延的山脉被摧毁，整个地貌被烧毁，盘旋的权力机构从空中坠落，其漂浮的城市在饥饿的大地之下被吞噬。",
	"The dwarven clan of Grimgol that once helped hold the center of the Ashkeeper Peaks was nearly wiped out during the Calamity. The surviving families and warriors burrowed deep beneath the surface of Exandria to wait out the chaos. Collapsing nearly every established tunnel used in the wars above, the clan found themselves cut off from the rest of Exandria. For centuries, the dwarves of Clan Grimgol endured the darkness alone, defending against the dregs of the Betrayer Gods' forces and adapting themselves into a hardy and stalwart people.": "曾经帮助守住灰烬守护者山峰中心的矮人部族在灾变中几乎被消灭了。幸存的家族和战士们在埃克桑德里亚的地表下深埋，等待混乱的到来。几乎所有在上面的战争中使用过的既定隧道都坍塌了，该部族发现自己与埃克桑德里亚的其他地方隔绝了。几个世纪以来，格里高尔氏族的矮人独自忍受着黑暗，抵御背叛者之神的残余势力，并将自己改造成一个坚韧而顽强的民族。",
	"Half-remembered tales and myths of their forgotten history, mingled with worship of Moradin, began to stir an eagerness to return to their ancestral home and build anew. With new purpose, they carved their way back toward the surface, only to find the mountains of their home reduced to dust and pebbles.": "他们被遗忘的历史的半记得的故事和神话，与对莫拉丁的崇拜混在一起，开始激起他们返回祖先的家园和重新建设的渴望。带着新的目标，他们向地表凿去，却发现他们家园的山脉已化为灰尘和卵石。",
	"Not easily dissuaded, the dwarves returned to the surface for the first time in generations, finding the once-ruined world now recovering with renewed life and color. The resilient clan made their way north along the Brokenveil Bluffs and found a massive mountain to house their new city. They built their stronghold into this monolith among the Dunrock Mountains, and gave their new home the name of Grimgolir.": "矮人并没有被轻易劝阻，他们几代人以来第一次回到地面，发现曾经被破坏的世界正在恢复新的生命和色彩。坚韧不拔的部族沿着断肠崖一路向北，找到了一座巨大的山，作为他们新城市的所在地。他们在敦罗克山中的这块巨石上建立了自己的据点，并给他们的新家起了一个名字--格林戈里尔。",
	"In the Marrow Valley, the numerous decades following the Divergence left the landscape blackened and inhospitable. The remaining people struggled for food and shelter as they wandered the rocky hills for centuries, avoiding the colder weather of the north. Nomadic sects of humans and halflings defended themselves against the hungry beasts and lingering evils threatening their homesteads, and fought with each other over fertile land.": "在马罗河谷，分歧之后的无数个年代使地貌变黑、荒凉。剩下的人们为了食物和住所而挣扎，他们在岩石山丘上游荡了几个世纪，避开了北方的寒冷天气。人类和半身人的游牧教派抵御饥饿的野兽和威胁其家园的挥之不去的邪恶，并为争夺肥沃的土地而相互争斗。",
	"Small civilizations began to form amid the chaos, but it wasn't until the central township of Zadash was established as a safe outpost that the unification of the Marrow Valley began. Helmed by the Julous family, supposedly of noble blood from before the Calamity, a guarded community with an organized military force was built in the center of the valley around four hundred years ago. It became both a haven for the struggling masses and a center for agricultural expansion.": "小型文明开始在混乱中形成，但直到扎达什中心镇作为一个安全的前哨建立起来，马罗河谷的统一才开始。在朱鲁斯家族的领导下，据说在灾变之前就有贵族血统，大约四百年前在山谷的中心建立了一个有组织的军事力量的守卫社区。它既成为挣扎的大众的避难所，也成为农业扩张的中心。",
	"Increasing their strength with each generation, this movement guided by the Julous family became known as the Julous Dominion, stretching across the south end of Western Wynandir. Not all agreed to join the Julous Dominion, however. Some outliers rejected the Julous interests, founding their own village of Kamordah on the boiling earth of the hills in the southwest Marrow Valley. In time, the people of Kamordah came to worship a being of primordial fire that lives beneath the mountains and speaks to them in dreams and visions.": "每一代人的力量都在增加，这场由朱鲁斯家族指导的运动被称为朱鲁斯统治区，横跨西威南迪尔的南端。然而，并非所有的人都同意加入朱鲁斯统治区。一些离群索居者拒绝了朱鲁斯的利益，在西南部马罗谷的山丘沸腾的土地上建立了他们自己的卡莫达村。随着时间的推移，卡莫达的人们开始崇拜一个住在山下的原始火种，并在梦境和幻觉中与他们交谈。",
	"In the frigid fields north of the Marrow Valley, the survivors of the Arcanum city of Zemniaz scraped by in the snow for centuries, clutching their surviving scrolls and fragments of cultural history. They established the dour outposts of Icehaven and Yrrosa, but it wasn't until the Zemnian people wandered east to the Pearlbow Wilderness that they found fields that were fertile enough to nurture a new society.": "在骨髓谷北部寒冷的原野上，阿卡诺姆城市泽姆尼亚斯的幸存者在雪地上苟延残喘了几个世纪，紧紧抓住他们幸存的卷轴和文化历史的碎片。他们建立了冰港和Yrrosa的沉闷前哨，但直到泽姆尼亚斯人向东流浪到珍珠弓荒野，他们才发现了足以孕育一个新社会的肥沃土地。",
	"Founded atop the ruins of an ancient temple to the Dawn Father, the city of Rexxentrum rose to become the hub of Zemnian culture. Now that the Zemnian people no longer had to struggle for survival amid the harsh elements, their leaders argued over how to establish a centralized government. Some wished for a republic, while others sought a theocracy under the priests that shepherded the people into this new age. Eckhardt Dwendal, a well-respected merchant and tremendous force behind the development of Rexxentrum, wished to institute a monarchy and place his son Manfried on the throne. Debate spun wildly for over three years, while Eckhardt privately made deals with the heads of the emerging guilds, using promises or blackmail to secure their cooperation. With the resounding support of the flourishing guild heads, the throne was established. In the year 539 of the post-Divergence era, Manfried became the first emperor of the Dwendalian Empire.": "在一座古老的黎明之父神庙的废墟上建立起来的雷克森特鲁姆城，成为泽姆尼亚文化的中心。现在，泽姆尼亚人不再需要在恶劣的环境中为生存而挣扎，他们的领导人为如何建立一个中央集权的政府而争论不休。一些人希望建立一个共和国，而另一些人则寻求在牧民进入这个新时代的祭司的领导下建立神权。埃克哈特-德文达尔（Eckhardt Dwendal）是一位备受尊敬的商人，也是雷克辛顿发展背后的巨大力量，他希望建立一个君主制，让他的儿子曼弗雷德（Manfried）登上王位。辩论疯狂地进行了三年多，而埃克哈特私下里与新兴行会的负责人进行了交易，用承诺或敲诈来确保他们的合作。在蓬勃发展的行会首脑的响亮支持下，王位得以确立。在后分歧时代的539年，曼弗雷德成为德文达尔帝国的第一位皇帝。",
	"It wasn't long before the expanding borders of the Dwendalian Empire began to push up against the growing Julous Dominion. An agreement was brokered to avoid conflict as long as favorable trade could be established and maintained. Even so, the resource-rich center of Western Wynandir was split between the two states, with both factions eager to discover the other's weaknesses. Rumors of the discovery of a massive platinum mine within the Julous Dominion further increased the empire's desire to conquer their neighbor.": "没过多久，德文达尔帝国不断扩张的边界就开始向日益壮大的朱鲁斯统治区逼近。双方达成了一项协议，只要能够建立和维持有利的贸易，就可以避免冲突。即便如此，资源丰富的西威南迪尔中心还是被两个国家分割开来，两个派别都急于发现对方的弱点。关于在朱鲁斯领地内发现大规模铂金矿的传言进一步增加了帝国征服邻国的欲望。",
	"At this time, religious leaders throughout the Dwendalian Empire rebelled against the emperor's religious restrictions. After his coronation, Emperor Manfried Dwendal enacted laws limiting worship and prayer to subjects concerning the power, profit, and expansion of the empire. In the year 544 PD, internal strife and insurgent action turned bloody when the zealous leaders of varying faiths attempted, and failed, to usurp the throne for their council. An angered Emperor Manfried Dwendal had the rebellious priests executed—an event that came to be known as the Admonition.": "这时，整个德文达尔帝国的宗教领袖都在反抗皇帝的宗教限制。在加冕之后，曼弗雷德-德文达尔皇帝颁布了法律，将崇拜和祈祷限制在有关帝国权力、利润和扩张的主题上。公元544年，不同信仰的狂热领袖试图为他们的议会篡夺王位，但没有成功，内部纷争和叛乱行动变得血腥。愤怒的皇帝曼弗雷德-德文达尔（Manfried Dwendal）将叛乱的祭司处死--这一事件被称为 \"训诫\"。",
	"The emperor spoke of abolishing all worship within his boundaries. This caused further uproar among the populace, but then Emperor Manfried's spies discovered that the seeds of the uprising had been sown by Julous interests. Publicly exposing the plot, the emperor outlawed only select faiths that he felt threatened civilized life. He redirected much of the people's fury by also proclaiming the Julous Dominion an enemy of the empire later that year and declaring war on the neighboring nation.": "皇帝说要在他的地盘上废除一切崇拜。这在民众中引起了进一步的骚动，但随后曼弗雷德皇帝的间谍发现，起义的种子是由朱鲁斯利益集团播下的。皇帝公开揭露了这一阴谋，只取缔了他认为威胁到文明生活的特定信仰。当年晚些时候，他还宣布朱鲁斯领地为帝国的敌人，并向这个邻国宣战，从而转移了人们的大部分怒火。",
	"Meanwhile, the Julous Dominion was dealing with the refusal of the outlying villages near Kamordah to accept their rule in this time of brewing hostility. They eventually drove the independent villagers back into the Cyrios Mountains, just in time to hear the horns of war blaring from the empire to the north. The violent conflict known as the Marrow War lasted over sixteen months and cost the lives of many soldiers and innocents on both sides of the Marrow Valley.": "与此同时，朱鲁斯统治区正在处理卡莫达附近的外围村庄拒绝接受他们在这个酝酿敌意的时期的统治的问题。他们最终将独立的村民赶回了赛里奥斯山脉，正好听到北方帝国响起的战争号角。被称为马罗战争的暴力冲突持续了16个多月，马罗河谷两边的许多士兵和无辜者都付出了生命。",
	"The Julous Dominion lacked the unified military force of the empire. When a major military push left the capital city of Zadash occupied by the empire, Baron Inock Julous and Baroness Tessandra Julous met with Emperor Manfried to negotiate a peace. During this meeting, the baron and baroness were unceremoniously executed. Their bodies were displayed publicly along with the narrative that they had attempted an assassination on the emperor during the peace talks. Disheartened and bereft of leadership, the Julous Dominion immediately came to an end, as did the war.": "朱鲁斯统治区缺乏帝国的统一军事力量。当一次重大的军事行动让帝国的首都扎达什被占领时，伊诺克-朱鲁斯男爵和泰桑德拉-朱鲁斯男爵夫人与曼弗雷德皇帝会面，商讨和平事宜。在这次会面中，男爵和男爵夫人被毫不客气地处决了。他们的尸体连同他们在和谈期间试图暗杀皇帝的说法一起被公开展示。沮丧和失去领导的朱鲁斯王朝立即结束，战争也随之结束。",
	"To prove his benevolence to the people of the newly conquered Julous Dominion, and to help avoid future uprisings, Emperor Manfried declared that all citizens of the dominion would keep their lands and homesteads. No soldiers would stand trial or be punished for their previous allegiance. Life would continue as it had, except for the implementation of imperial taxes, laws, and oversight across the valley under the new emperor. Outlawed religious iconography was destroyed, crops and goods were redistributed according to the needs of the empire, and life slowly returned to normal for the Zemnian people.": "为了证明他对新征服的朱鲁斯领地的人民的仁慈，并帮助避免未来的起义，曼弗雷德皇帝宣布，该领地的所有公民将保留他们的土地和宅基地。没有士兵会因为他们以前的效忠而接受审判或受到惩罚。除了在新皇帝的领导下在整个山谷实施帝国的税收、法律和监督之外，生活将继续保持原样。被取缔的宗教图腾被销毁，作物和货物根据帝国的需要被重新分配，泽姆尼亚人的生活慢慢恢复了正常。",
	"With citizens of the former Julous Dominion tense beneath their new rule and a growing sentiment of frustration with imperial leadership building, Emperor Manfried sought a way to reform the nation under his banner. The propagandist minds who fought the social war with the Julous Dominion recommended a shift in public image and title, one that could command more respect within Western Wynandir while casting aside the oppressive connotations of the title of emperor. Still riding high on the victory against the Dominion, Emperor Manfried harkened back to the halcyon lore of the Age of Arcanum, recalling the beloved kings and queens of old. It was decided that the people would no longer have an emperor, but a king. Crowning himself the first of the line of Dwendalian kings, King Manfried insisted on maintaining the now-ominous national title of the Dwendalian Empire, famously proclaiming, \"I am the Dwendalian king to my people, beloved and open to their wishes. To our enemies, we remain resolute and unstoppable. We are the Dwendalian Empire.\"": "前朱鲁斯领地的公民在他们的新统治下感到紧张，对帝国领导层的挫败感越来越强烈，曼弗雷德皇帝寻求一种方法来改革他旗下的国家。与朱鲁斯统治区进行社会战争的宣传家们建议改变公众形象和头衔，一个能在西维南迪尔获得更多尊重的头衔，同时抛开皇帝头衔的压迫性内涵。曼弗雷德皇帝还在为战胜多米尼克而兴奋不已，他回想起了阿卡努姆时代的美好传说，回忆起古老的受人喜爱的国王和女王。决定人民将不再有一个皇帝，而是一个国王。曼弗雷德国王自封为德文达里的第一位国王，他坚持维持现在德文达里帝国这一著名的国家头衔，著名地宣称：\"对我的人民来说，我是德文达里的国王，受人爱戴，对他们的愿望开放。对于我们的敌人，我们仍然是坚定的，不可阻挡的。我们是德文达里亚帝国\"。",
	"Not a quarter century after the Marrow War ended and the line of kings was established, a smaller, internal conflict rocked the capital city of Rexxentrum. A number of noble houses with a strong history of studying arcane pursuits began to compete with other high-born magic practitioners from the Julous Dominion. Throughout the lands of the newly expanded empire, these houses escalated their subterfuge and espionage against one another, until the rivalry finally erupted into an all-out magical conflict in the streets of the capital itself.": "在马罗战争结束和王系建立后不到四分之一个世纪，一场较小的内部冲突震撼了首都雷克森特姆。一些有着浓厚的研究奥术历史的贵族家族开始与来自朱鲁斯领地的其他高血统的魔法从业者竞争。在整个新扩张的帝国的土地上，这些家族不断升级他们的潜规则和间谍活动，直到竞争最终在首都的街道上爆发为一场全面的魔法冲突。",
	"The events of the Eve of Crimson Midnight destroyed numerous buildings and maimed a number of innocents caught in the crossfire. The struggle ended with all involved shackled and brought before the king. After days of deliberation, an agreement was drawn up that would absolve those involved of the usual punishment in exchange for direct subservience to the Crown and the goals of the empire. Establishing themselves as the Cerberus Assembly, this council of mages became a powerful tool for the empire to maintain its position as the dominant force of Wildemount.": "深红午夜前夕的事件摧毁了许多建筑物，并使一些无辜者在交火中致残。斗争结束后，所有参与的人都被戴上镣铐，被带到国王面前。经过几天的商议，一项协议被起草出来，该协议将免除那些参与其中的人的常规惩罚，以换取对王室和帝国目标的直接服从。这个法师委员会建立了自己的地狱之神大会，成为帝国维持其作为野蛮人主导力量地位的有力工具。",
	"For three hundred years, the empire has expanded and prospered under the rule of the Dwendalian line of kings. King Alfwin Dwendal increased the empire's military power by establishing the stronghold of Bladegarden and assimilating Grimgolir into the empire, seeking to hold back the savage creatures of Xhorhas. King Theoderich Dwendal's benevolent nature brokered the partnership with the Clovis Concord of the Menagerie Coast without bloodshed and ushered in new opportunities for trade with the rest of Exandria. King Willamar Dwendal established the initial prominence of House Truscan and granted them oversight of the Truscan Vale, to the displeasure of the other noble houses.": "三百年来，帝国在德文达尔王系的统治下不断扩张和繁荣。阿尔夫温-德文达尔国王通过建立布拉德加登的据点和将格林戈里尔同化到帝国中来增强了帝国的军事力量，力求阻挡Xhorhas的野蛮生物。西奥德里奇-德文达尔国王的仁慈本性在没有流血的情况下促成了与美纳吉海岸的克洛维斯协约的合作，并迎来了与埃克桑德里亚其他地区贸易的新机会。威拉玛-德文达尔国王确立了特鲁斯卡家族最初的显赫地位，并授予他们对特鲁斯卡谷地的监督权，这让其他贵族家族很不高兴。",
	"Other kings have come and gone, but few have made as immediate and lasting a mark as King Bertrand Dwendal. On assuming the throne in 790 PD, King Bertrand immediately demonstrated his love of spectacle and social manipulation by instituting town criers across the empire to disseminate Crown-approved messages. With the aid of Master Ikithon Trent of the Cerberus Assembly, he captured the imagination of the masses with well-crafted tales of his deeds, proclaimed by the criers in every town square.": "其他国王来了又走，但很少有人像贝特朗-德文达尔国王那样留下了直接而持久的印记。公元790年，贝特朗国王一登基，就在帝国各地设立了传令官，传播王室批准的信息，从而立即显示出他对场面和社会操纵的热爱。在Cerberus大会的Ikithon Trent大师的帮助下，他用精心制作的事迹故事吸引了大众的想象力，并由传令兵在每个城镇广场上宣扬。",
	"Seeking to bury any dissent against the Crown, King Dwendal began to use the empire's spy network to seek out sources of unrest in the public and punish those who sowed thoughts of rebellion. Public holidays and celebrations were given greater funding to quell the masses and distract the people from the increase in taxation implemented across the valley. This allowed King Bertrand Dwendal to rise in popularity while also ruling with a far more ruthless and self-serving agenda than most kings before him.": "为了掩盖任何对王室的异议，德文达尔国王开始利用帝国的间谍网络寻找公众的不安源，并惩罚那些播种叛乱思想的人。公共假期和庆祝活动得到了更多的资助，以平息群众的情绪，并分散人们对整个山谷实施的增税的注意力。这使得伯特兰-德文达尔国王的声望上升，同时也以比他之前的大多数国王更无情和更自私的方式进行统治。",
	"King Bertrand maintains the isolationist world view of his predecessors, even in times of need. By ignoring political alliances from distant nations, preventing the construction of any skyship docks within the empire, and ignoring calls for aid—such as the fight against the rising threat of Vecna two decades before—the King believes he has made the empire stronger than it's ever been.": "贝特朗国王保持着其前任的孤立主义世界观，即使在需要的时候也是如此。通过无视来自遥远国家的政治联盟，阻止在帝国内建造任何天空船坞，以及无视援助的呼吁--比如二十年前对抗Vecna的崛起威胁--国王相信他已经使帝国比以往任何时候都更强大。",
	"However, the king's focus on isolationism fades as tensions with Xhorhas grow. Worry about his legacy mingles with the new and deadly threat of the Kryn Dynasty, now emboldened and pushing into his kingdom with strange magics and dangerous warriors. He mistrusts the very Cerberus Assembly that grants him so much influence and arcane might to combat the ever-darker world that barks at the borders of the empire. Public approval of his rule wanes with growing economic disparity, and the whisper of Myriad power returning under his nose only heightens his paranoia.": "然而，随着与Xhorhas的关系日益紧张，国王对孤立主义的关注逐渐消失。对他的遗产的担忧与克莱恩王朝新的致命威胁交织在一起，克莱恩王朝现在有恃无恐，用奇怪的魔法和危险的战士向他的王国推进。他不信任授予他如此大的影响力和神秘力量的地狱犬议会，以对抗在帝国边界叫嚣的越来越黑暗的世界。公众对他的统治的认可随着经济差距的扩大而减弱，而Myriad力量在他眼皮底下回归的悄悄话只会加剧他的妄想。",
	"When the Kryn orchestrated an attack on the Halls of Erudition in Zadash, the Cerberus Assembly pushed for a display of military power to rally the people and bring unity to the national identity of the empire. The king declared war on the Kryn Dynasty and the people of Xhorhas, embroiling the region in this new full-scale conflict, with the hope that, as history has proven, people are easier to unite against a common enemy.": "当克莱恩人策划了对扎达什的博学堂的攻击时，地狱犬议会推动了军事力量的展示，以集结人民并使帝国的国家身份得到统一。国王向克莱恩王朝和Xhorhas的人民宣战，将该地区卷入这场新的全面冲突中，希望正如历史所证明的那样，人们更容易团结起来对抗共同的敌人。",
	"While destruction came to the farthest reaches of the world during the divine conflicts of the Calamity, the islands of the Lucidian Ocean off the western coast of Wildemount thought they might fare better than most. But though they were far removed from the central fury of the magics unleashed in the final battles, the region's civilizations were instead wiped out by massive floods. Immense tidal surges left the coast drowned and empty, the islands consumed by the raging ocean, leaving behind only the most accomplished of sailors. Eventually, the waters settled once more, and nature swiftly reclaimed the lands with lush green jungles.": "在灾变的神圣冲突中，世界上最遥远的地方都遭到了破坏，而荒野山庄西海岸外的琉璃海岛屿却以为他们的情况会比大多数人好。但是，尽管他们远离了最后战斗中释放的魔法的中心怒火，该地区的文明反而被大规模的洪水所消灭。巨大的潮汐使海岸被淹没，空无一人，岛屿被汹涌的海洋吞噬，只留下了最有成就的水手们。最终，水面再次平静下来，大自然迅速地用郁郁葱葱的丛林恢复了这片土地。",
	"The few scattered survivors of the floods found shelter among the higher jungles of the Swavain Islands, gifted with the bounty of a more plentiful and tropical environment. These seafaring people rebuilt among the islands and took the name Ki'Nau, meaning \"the Water Children\" in their language of Naush. Though the terrible floods of the Calamity had passed, the deadly seas and flourishing horrors of the wilds were still a persistent threat to the Ki'Nau. Each generation struggled to survive the elements that sunk their boats and the predators of the jungles and ocean depths.": "洪水中为数不多的零星幸存者在斯瓦文群岛较高的丛林中找到了庇护所，得到了更丰富的热带环境的恩赐。这些航海者在岛上重建，并取名为Ki'Nau，在他们的纳什语中意为 \"水孩子\"。虽然灾难中可怕的洪水已经过去，但致命的海洋和荒野的繁荣恐怖仍然是对Ki'Nau人持续的威胁。每一代人都在挣扎着，以便在击沉他们的船只和丛林及海洋深处的掠食者的因素中生存。",
	"Over time, an older mind began to call from the waters and entered their dreams. This powerful being, a leviathan creation abandoned by his creator Zehir in the Divergence, called himself Uk'otoa. He spoke of his divinity and promised protection to the Ki'Nau people in exchange for their worship. The Ki'Nau accepted the persuasive entity as an ally and protector, allowing Uk'otoa to rise up as the guardian of the islands and help the Ki'Nau become a proud society of warriors, establishing dominance over the region for centuries.": "随着时间的推移，一个古老的思想开始从水中呼唤，进入他们的梦境。这个强大的生命，是被他的创造者泽希尔在分歧中抛弃的利维坦造物，自称为乌克奥托亚。他谈到了自己的神性，并承诺保护基诺人以换取他们的崇拜。基诺人接受了这个有说服力的实体作为盟友和保护者，让乌克奥托亚作为岛屿的守护者崛起，并帮助基诺人成为一个骄傲的战士社会，在该地区建立了数百年的统治地位。",
	"Around the year 400 PD, an exploration vessel from the distant land of Marquet was nearing the end of its provisions when it reached the Swavain Islands. Discovered and captured by the ever-watchful Ki'Nau, the desperate explorers made trade offerings of foreign gold, spices, and fine silks. This diplomatic approach won over the leaders of the Ki'Nau, and an alliance was made with the Marquesian travelers to return with trade goods and establish a Marquesian outpost, which was to be named Damali.": "公元400年左右，一艘来自遥远的马奎特大陆的探险船在到达斯瓦文群岛时，其供给已经接近尾声。被永远警惕的Ki'Nau发现并捕获，绝望的探险家们用外国的黄金、香料和精美的丝绸作为贸易礼物。这种外交手段赢得了基诺族领导人的支持，并与马克西族旅行者结成联盟，带着贸易货物返回，并建立一个马克西族的前哨站，该站被命名为达马里。",
	"During this time, a cruel seafaring culture called the Vukan discovered the Ki'Nau and coveted their lush homesteads and rich, sea-gathered jewelry. These Vukan began a series of coordinated assaults on the Ki'Nau, killing and kidnapping a number of them under the shadow of night. The Marquesian guilds who had sent the exploration ship agreed to offer naval support to combat these attacks, but it was Uk'otoa whose fury ultimately annihilated the Vukan at their home villages and erased them from Exandria.": "在这期间，一种被称为武康人的残酷航海文化发现了基诺人，并觊觎他们郁郁葱葱的家园和丰富的海中采集的珠宝。这些武康人开始对基诺人进行一系列协调的攻击，在夜幕下杀害和绑架了许多人。派出勘探船的马克西亚行会同意提供海军支援，以打击这些攻击，但最终是乌克托亚的怒火在武坎人的家乡消灭了他们，并将他们从埃克桑德里亚抹去。",
	"Having lost a portion of their fleet in these fights, the surviving Marquesian naval ships remained to build small settlements along the coast to aid in their trade with the Ki'Nau. The Ki'Nau leader Tauan kept a tentative peace with the foreign sailors, but Uk'otoa wanted to dominate the new arrivals who refused to renounce their old gods and bow to him. These tensions came to a head when a secret sect of Marquesian worshipers of the Cloaked Serpent Zehir were given a task by their enraged god from beyond the Divine Gate: to destroy Uk'otoa for his insolence. With the aid of a powerful cult leader within an archeological guild known as the Allegiance of Allsight, a series of temples built to Uk'otoa were corrupted with Zehir's influence and used to seal Uk'otoa deep beneath the rock of the ocean floor, robbing the Ki'Nau of their patron.": "在这些战斗中损失了一部分舰队后，幸存的马克思主义海军舰艇仍然沿着海岸建立小型定居点，以帮助他们与Ki'Nau的贸易。基诺族领导人陶安与外国水手保持着试探性的和平，但乌克奥托亚想支配那些拒绝放弃他们的旧神而向他低头的新来者。当马尔克斯的一个秘密教派的斗篷蛇泽希尔的崇拜者被他们来自神门之外的愤怒的神赋予了一项任务时，这些紧张关系就开始了：摧毁乌克托亚的无礼。在一个被称为 \"Allsight的忠诚 \"的考古行会中一个强大的邪教领袖的帮助下，一系列为Uk'otoa建造的寺庙被泽希尔的影响所腐蚀，并被用来将Uk'otoa封印在海底的岩石下，使Ki'Nau失去了他们的守护者。",
	"At this time, the city of Ank'Harel in Marquet had just named the mysterious J'mon Sa Ord as their new emperor. In the transition, the Marquesian colonists now living along the coast demanded independence from Marquet to begin building their own society and identity alongside the Ki'Nau. Ord eventually accepted the request, and the emancipated Marquesians allied themselves with the Ki'Nau to build a new civilization. Over the following centuries, numerous port towns sprung up and grew into city states, trade routes expanded along what is now known as the Menagerie Coast, and the emerging guilds consolidated enough power to become the region's ruling class: the Clovis Concord.": "此时，马尔凯特的安克哈雷尔市刚刚任命神秘的J'mon Sa Ord为他们的新皇帝。在过渡时期，现在居住在沿海地区的马克思主义殖民者要求从马尔凯特独立出来，开始与基诺族一起建立自己的社会和身份。奥德最终接受了这一请求，被解放的马克思人与基诺人结盟，建立了一个新的文明。在接下来的几个世纪里，无数的港口城镇兴起并发展成为城市国家，贸易路线沿着现在被称为Menagerie海岸的地方扩展，新兴的行会巩固了足够的权力，成为该地区的统治阶层：Clovis Concord。",
	"The concord works together to keep the surrounding Lucidian Ocean under their watch and rule, setting trade laws and guiding the fortunes of those who sail on the open waters. The blend of cultures that forms the Menagerie Coast creates a diverse community where the arts are lauded and coin is king. However, the shadow of the Myriad syndicate continues to infiltrate the streets, while the pirate alliance known as the Revelry has risen to harry the trade routes and rebel against the concord. Tensions are further escalated by the threat of expanding war to the northeast between the Dwendalian Empire and the Kryn Dynasty.": "协约国共同努力，将周围的卢西迪亚海洋置于他们的监视和统治之下，制定贸易法律，指导那些在开放水域航行的人的财富。文化的融合构成了Menagerie海岸，创造了一个多元化的社区，在这里，艺术受到推崇，钱币是国王。然而，Myriad集团的阴影继续渗透到街道上，而被称为 \"狂欢 \"的海盗联盟已经崛起，骚扰贸易路线并反叛协约。东北部的德文达尔帝国和克里恩王朝之间的战争威胁使紧张局势进一步升级。",
	"The fierce powers released in the conflicts of the Calamity tore through the heavily forested region now known as the Greying Wildlands, setting ablaze a slow-burning arcane forest fire that smoldered for nearly a century, burning through the hearty trees of the region like a plague of embers. The northern realm was left desolate, ashes and dirt blown into dust and sand as the chill northern winds transformed the rolling hills into a desert of ice and pebbles. Fleeing remnants of the Grimgol dwarves delved into the snow-hooded Flotket Alps, many freezing to death in the wind-battered valleys before finding safety in the natural caverns hiding deep in the mountain range. Within these icy depths, the dwarves cultivated fiery hearths and brought warmth to the heart of the mountain, establishing the new dwarven city of Uthodurn.": "灾难冲突中释放出的猛烈力量撕裂了现在被称为 \"灰色荒野 \"的茂密森林地区，点燃了一场缓慢燃烧的奥术森林之火，它燃烧了近一个世纪，像一场余烬的瘟疫一样烧毁了该地区的丰饶树木。北部地区一片荒凉，灰烬和泥土被寒冷的北风吹成了灰尘和沙子，连绵的山丘变成了冰和卵石的沙漠。逃亡的格林戈尔矮人残部深入到白雪皑皑的弗洛特克特阿尔卑斯山，许多人在被风吹散的山谷中冻死，然后在隐藏在山脉深处的天然岩洞中找到了安全。在这些冰冷的深处，矮人培植了火热的炉灶，为山的中心地带带来了温暖，建立了新的矮人城市乌索杜恩。",
	"Amid the charred remains of the burning forest that filled the sky with smoke for over a hundred years, one section of the woods defied the flames and held against the embers that battered it. This small patch of idyllic green endured, a sanctuary for the surviving wood elves that held fast and hoped for a miracle. Sensing that the blessings of Melora and Corellon had kept the heart of this forest alive until the fires burned out, the elves began to build a new home among the ancient trees and groves.": "在燃烧的森林的烧焦的残骸中，一百多年来，天空中充满了浓烟，有一片树林不畏烈焰，抵挡住了撞击它的余烬。这一小片田园诗般的绿色经久不衰，是幸存的木精灵的避难所，他们坚守着，希望有奇迹发生。感觉到梅洛拉和科瑞隆的祝福使这片森林的心脏得以存活，直到大火烧尽，精灵们开始在古老的树木和丛林中建造一个新的家园。",
	"This region became the Veluthil Forest, and from this verdant sanctuary, the elves would build the stunningly beautiful city of Molaesmyr. From the surrounding ashes, the fey magics of Veluthil brought forth new life and leaf, expanding the boundaries of the forest over centuries to eventually reclaim much of the Wildlands. Druidic forces and powerful fey enchantments were laid throughout the twisting paths of the forest to protect the elves of Molaesmyr as they expanded their towering city, the central trees reaching magically enhanced heights as homes and halls extended high into the boughs. The elven city stood as the height of reborn civilization on Wildemount.": "这个地区成为了维鲁蒂尔森林，在这个青翠的庇护所中，精灵们建立了令人惊叹的美丽城市--莫拉伊斯米尔。从周围的灰烬中，维鲁斯尔的精灵魔法带来了新的生命和树叶，在几个世纪里扩大了森林的边界，最终收回了大部分荒地。德鲁伊的力量和强大的费伊魔法遍布森林的曲折小路，以保护莫莱斯米尔的精灵们，因为他们正在扩建他们高耸的城市，中心的树木达到了神奇的高度，房屋和大厅延伸到高高的树枝上。这座精灵城市是野人山重生文明的高峰。",
	"It is still unclear what triggered the event. Whether some knowledge-hungry researcher or arrogant sorcerer was delving in forgotten vaults between the planes, or some terrible power lying dormant beneath the forest was awakened, the source of the corruption is unknown. What is known is that in the year 585 PD, suddenly and without warning, a wave of purple-gray shadow rapidly crept from the center of Molaesmyr to engulf the entire city.": "目前还不清楚是什么触发了这一事件。不管是一些渴望知识的研究者还是傲慢的巫师在各位面之间钻研被遗忘的地窖，还是一些沉睡在森林下的可怕力量被唤醒，腐败的来源都是未知的。人们知道的是，在公元585年，突然间，在没有任何警告的情况下，一波紫灰色的阴影迅速从莫莱斯米尔的中心爬升，吞噬了整个城市。",
	"Many elves choked and died on toxic fumes, while others were twisted and driven mad, transforming into terrifying fey abominations. Trees bent and warped, leaves withered and turned a sickly purple, and strange, unknown bramble growths reclaimed the forest floor. This corruption slowly spread throughout the entire Veluthil Forest, decimating the home of the elves. Some survivors fled as fast as they could to the northwest, across the Frigid Depths, eventually settling the township of Bysaes Tyl in the Pearlbow Wilderness. Others escaped to the northeast, seeking refuge in the Flotket Alps, freezing in the snowy mountains until they stumbled on the dwarves of Uthodurn.": "许多精灵被有毒烟雾呛死，而其他精灵则被扭曲和逼疯，变成了可怕的精灵怪兽。树木弯曲变形，树叶枯萎，变成病态的紫色，奇怪的、未知的荆棘生长在森林的地面上。这种腐败慢慢地蔓延到整个维鲁斯尔森林，毁灭了精灵的家园。一些幸存者以最快的速度逃往西北方，穿越冰冷的深渊，最终在珍珠弓荒野的比塞斯-泰尔镇定居下来。其他人则逃往东北方，在弗洛特阿尔卑斯山寻求庇护，在雪山上受冻，直到他们偶然发现了乌索德恩的矮人。",
	"Taking pity on the survivors, the dwarves took in the elven refugees and offered them a home. This act of kindness changed the course of Uthodurn's history, eventually forming a unique union of dwarven and elven culture that has endured for nearly three centuries. Craftsmanship within Uthodurn is second to none, but nothing is traded beyond the borders of the city, aside from the odd stolen artifact. Small excavation parties are often sent to the corrupted Veluthil Forest—now called the Savalirwood—to search the ruins of Molaesmyr, attempting to piece together what caused the corruption and determine if the forest can be recovered.": "矮人怜悯幸存者，收留了精灵难民，为他们提供了一个家。这一善举改变了乌索杜恩的历史进程，最终形成了矮人和精灵文化的独特结合，并持续了近三个世纪之久。Uthodurn的手工艺是首屈一指的，但除了零星的被盗文物外，没有任何东西能在城市的边界之外进行交易。小型挖掘队经常被派往腐败的维鲁蒂尔森林--现在被称为萨瓦里尔森林--搜索莫拉伊斯米尔的废墟，试图拼凑出导致腐败的原因，并确定森林是否可以恢复。",
	"Unfortunately, a township of criminals and outlaws has sprung up on the southern edge of the Savalirwood, just beyond the Dwendalian Empire. In addition to the dangerous denizens of this wretched thicket, which is known as Shadycreek Run, there are numerous raiders and thieves seeking relics from the ruins of the forest, escalating conflict throughout the region.": "不幸的是，在萨瓦利林的南部边缘，就在德文达利安帝国之外，出现了一个罪犯和不法分子的乡镇。除了这个被称为Shadycreek Run的可恶灌木丛中的危险居民外，还有许多从森林废墟中寻找遗物的袭击者和盗贼，使整个地区的冲突升级。",
	"The once thickly forested landscape of Xhorhas was the site of the final battleground of the Calamity. It was subjugated to such intense destruction at the hands of the warring gods that when the dust of the Divergence cleared, Eastern Wynandir was naught but a cracked, ashen wasteland. Ghor Dranas, the citadel of the Betrayer Gods, lay broken, cursed, and abandoned, while lingering demons and monstrosities fled to the surrounding jagged cliffs and blackened marshlands. Discarded abominations seeped from beneath the ruined earth of Xhorhas's eastern shores, climbing past the Penumbra Range where the forgotten creations of the Betrayers were locked away.": "Xhorhas曾经是森林茂密的地方，是灾变的最后战场。它在交战的诸神手中受到了如此强烈的破坏，以至于当分歧的尘埃散去时，东怀恩迪尔只剩下一片龟裂的灰烬荒地。戈尔-德拉纳斯，背叛者之神的堡垒，躺在破碎的、被诅咒的和被遗弃的地方，而残存的恶魔和怪兽则逃到了周围的锯齿状悬崖和发黑的沼泽地。被丢弃的憎恶从霍哈斯东岸的废墟下渗出，爬过了被遗忘的背叛者的创造物被锁起来的潘恩布拉山脉。",
	"Throughout this wasteland, scattered bands of aimless men, beasts, and goblinkin battled for shelter and sustenance. These tribes were confined to their desolate home by the Ki'Nau leviathan who guarded the waters past the southern shores and the surviving dwarves of Grimgolir, who prevented any Xhorhasians from moving farther west. The nomadic, warring clans fought against the harsh conditions of the valley for centuries, only able to develop small bastions of civilization within the harsh wilderness.": "在这片荒地上，分散的无目的的人、野兽和Goblinkin的队伍为了避难和维持生计而战斗着。这些部落被守卫着南岸水域的Ki'Nau利维坦和幸存的Grimgolir矮人限制在他们荒凉的家园里，他们阻止任何Xhorhasians向更远的地方移动。游牧的、交战的部族与山谷的严酷条件斗争了几个世纪，只能在严酷的荒野中发展出小型的文明堡垒。",
	"Beneath the ruins of Ghor Dranas, a group of scavenging drow turned from Lolth, their primary deity for centuries, finding renewed faith in an esoteric entity they called the Luxon. Guided by the light of their new deity, the drow survived their ascent from deep within the Underdark and reclaimed the halls of Ghor Dranas for themselves, naming their new home Rosohna, or \"Rebirth.\" The leading house of Kryn helped build a new nation of dark elves who sought the surface as part of their worship, and slowly began to reach out to the nearby nomads to unite under the light of the Luxon.": "在Ghor Dranas的废墟下，一群拾荒的乌鸦放弃了他们几个世纪以来的主要神灵Lolth，重新找到了对一个神秘实体的信仰，他们称之为Luxon。在新神灵之光的指引下，这些乌鸦从暗黑深处幸存下来，并为自己夺回了戈尔-德拉纳斯的大厅，将他们的新家命名为Rosohna，或 \"重生\"。克林的领导家族帮助建立了一个由黑暗精灵组成的新国家，他们把寻找地表作为他们崇拜的一部分，并慢慢开始接触附近的游牧民族，在卢克松的光芒下团结起来。",
	"As the first nation of post-Calamity Xhorhas, the Kryn Dynasty worked to expand its reach throughout the wasteland and bring unity to the ravaging hordes. Dormant evils continued to rise from beneath the marshes and badlands of Xhorhas, spreading chaos and battling with the warriors who called the desolate valley their home. The struggle to convert the denizens of Eastern Wynandir to the light of the Luxon continues to this day, while the agents of Lolth seek to spite and destroy her once-chosen for their arrogance.": "作为后迦勒底时代Xhorhas的第一个国家，Kryn王朝努力在整个荒原上扩大其影响力，并为肆虐的群魔带来团结。沉睡的邪恶继续从Xhorhas的沼泽地和坏境下升起，散布混乱，并与那些把荒凉的山谷当作自己家的勇士们进行斗争。让东威南迪尔的居民皈依卢克逊之光的斗争一直持续到今天，而洛尔思的代理人则因为他们的傲慢而试图报复和摧毁她曾经的选民。",
	"Meanwhile, the dragonborn have begun to reach out to Exandria's sprawling political world, wishing to exchange knowledge and trade their gold and jewels for powerful magics to better their standing.": "与此同时，龙族已经开始向埃克桑德里亚庞大的政治世界伸出援手，希望交换知识，用他们的黄金和珠宝换取强大的魔法，以提高他们的地位。",
	"After the Calamity, a shard of the destroyed dragonkin city of Kethesk came to rest within the southern Dreemoth Ravine. The surviving dragonborn took advantage of the ravine's defensible layout to build a new city and made an alliance with the cave-dwelling, indigenous dragonborn they called ravenites, beginning the reformation of civilized dragonborn society.": "灾难过后，被摧毁的龙人城市凯瑟斯克（Kethesk）的碎片在南部的德雷莫斯峡谷（Dreemoth Ravine）安家落户。幸存的龙人利用峡谷可防御的布局建造了一座新的城市，并与居住在洞穴中的土著龙人结成联盟，他们称之为乌鸦人，开始了文明龙人社会的改革。",
	"With the ravenites as a labor force, the dragonborn harvested the massive brumestone crystals that had once held their city aloft, and the new city of Draconia began to take shape as a series of floating islands within the heart of the chasm. Calling themselves draconbloods, they spent hundreds of years slowly reconstructing their nation in seclusion, focusing entirely on their own enlightenment and pursuits. They eventually enslaved the ravenites to mine the ravine's gold and gemstones, and to ensure draconblood dominance in the region, leaving their minds free to focus on internal politics and arcane advancement.": "有了乌鸦人作为劳动力，龙裔收获了曾经支撑他们的城市的巨大的青石水晶，新的德拉科尼亚城开始成形，成为鸿沟中心地带的一系列浮动岛屿。他们自称为龙血人，花了数百年时间在隐居中慢慢重建自己的国家，完全专注于自己的启蒙和追求。他们最终奴役了乌鸦人，以开采峡谷中的黄金和宝石，并确保龙血人在该地区的主导地位，使他们的思想能够自由地专注于内部政治和奥术的发展。",
	"In the year 815 PD, an unexpected assault on Draconia came in the form of a group of ancient chromatic dragons calling themselves the Chroma Conclave. The mighty city of Draconia was immediately destroyed and left to crumble in the Dreemoth Ravine. A powerful white dragon called Vorugal, the Frigid Doom, claimed the ravine as its new domain, while the rest of the dragons sought conquest elsewhere in Exandria. These events shook the nations of Wildemount, sending the Clovis Concord and the Dwendalian Empire into a state of alert, while the Kryn Dynasty temporarily withdrew to Rosohna, fearing another attack.": "公元815年，一群自称 \"卓玛协约 \"的古老色龙对德拉科尼亚发起了意想不到的攻击。强大的德拉科尼亚城立即被摧毁，并被丢在德雷莫斯峡谷中。一头强大的白龙叫沃鲁加尔（Vorugal），冰冷的厄运，宣称该峡谷是它的新领域，而其余的龙则在艾克桑德里亚的其他地方寻求征服。这些事件震撼了怀德蒙的各个国家，使克洛维斯协约和德文达利亚帝国进入了警戒状态，而克莱恩王朝则因担心再次受到攻击而暂时撤退到罗索纳。",
	"As time passed, Vorugal and the entire Chroma Conclave were slain and the danger seemed to have dissipated. With Draconia sundered, the no-longer enslaved ravenites greatly outnumbered their previous masters; they claimed their freedom and punished the surviving draconbloods. A handful of draconian nobles fled to the Menagerie Coast or the Dwendalian Empire to seek asylum, leaving the ravenites to rebuild Wildemount dragonborn society on the ruins of their oppressors.": "随着时间的推移，沃鲁加尔和整个卓玛协约国被杀，危险似乎已经消散了。随着德拉科尼亚的分裂，不再被奴役的乌鸦人在数量上大大超过了他们以前的主人；他们要求自由并惩罚幸存的龙人血统。少数的龙人贵族逃到美纳吉海岸或德文达利亚帝国寻求庇护，留下乌鸦人在压迫者的废墟上重建怀德蒙龙人社会。",
	"In the past century, the Dwendalian Empire has clashed with the Kryn Dynasty. Small skirmishes and slain soldiers on both sides deter expansion beyond the Ashkeeper Peaks, with each faction keeping a close eye on the other.": "在过去的一个世纪里，德文达利安帝国与克里恩王朝发生了冲突。双方的小规模冲突和被杀的士兵阻止了向阿什肯峰以外的地区扩张，每个派别都在密切关注着对方。",
	"Recently, the empire's interest in growing Kryn influence has led to increasing curiosity about the source of the Kryn's mysterious arcane capabilities. Dwendalian spies successfully stole two of four artifacts known as \"{@item luxon beacon|egw|beacons},\" which seemed to be powerful sources of the unique magical energy called dunamis. The Bright Queen Leylas Kryn began an initiative steal back the beacons and assault Dwendalian strongholds until these sacred relics are returned. Now, in 835 PD, the resulting skirmishes have escalated into all-out war. A fifth beacon has been recently uncovered by the Cerberus Assembly, and the violence threatens to grow past the Ashkeeper Peaks and embroil other denizens of Wildemount in the conflict.": "最近，帝国对克里恩日益增长的影响力的兴趣，使得人们对克里恩人神秘的奥术能力的来源越来越好奇。德文达尔的间谍成功地偷走了四个被称为\"{@item luxon beacon|egw|beacons} \"的神器中的两个，它们似乎是被称为dunamis的独特魔法能量的强大来源。光明女王Leylas Kryn开始倡议偷回信标，并攻击Dwendalian的据点，直到这些神圣的遗物被归还。现在，在公元835年，由此产生的小规模冲突已经升级为全面战争。地狱犬议会最近发现了第五个信标，而暴力事件有可能发展到超过阿什守卫者山峰，并将荒野山的其他居民卷入冲突。",
	"The Divine Gate, established during the Divergence, is a powerful barrier between the Material Plane and the divine realms. The Divine Gate sealed away both the Betrayer Gods and the Prime Deities within their respective domains in hopes of salvaging the new age and preventing another Calamity. If the Divine Gate were to be destroyed by the unanimous effort of the Prime Deities, all powers would be unleashed, threatening armageddon. Thus, the gods patiently watch their creations from beyond the veil, lending what small power they can send through the gate to aid the goals of their faithful. In the absence of the gods, lesser entities seek to gain power and influence, making pacts with mortals and offering their own gifts in exchange for favor, worship, or deeds done in their name.": "神圣之门在分歧期间建立，是物质世界和神圣领域之间的一道强大屏障。神圣之门将背叛者诸神和主神都封印在他们各自的领域内，希望能挽救新时代并防止另一场灾难的发生。如果神门被主神们的一致努力所摧毁，所有的力量都会被释放出来，威胁到大决战。因此，诸神从面纱之外耐心地观察他们的创造物，借出他们可以通过神门发出的微小力量，帮助他们的信徒实现目标。在诸神缺席的情况下，较小的实体寻求获得权力和影响力，与凡人订立契约，并提供自己的礼物以换取青睐、崇拜或以他们的名义所做的事。",

When hunting, or in times of conflict, the warriors of the Kryn don their signature chitinous armor. A series of small airways woven through this armor can be opened to emit a loud, clicking buzz to intimidate their foes as they charge. This noise has inspired outsiders to call the Kryn \"cricks,\" referring to this cricket-like din.": "从Xhorhas地下洞穴的阴影深处走出来的克莱恩鸦人现在忍受着阳光的照射，这也是他们崇拜的一部分，尽管他们的城市在白天的时候被乌黑的魔法所遮蔽。在狩猎时，或在冲突时期，克莱恩的战士们会穿上他们标志性的几丁质盔甲。一系列编织在盔甲上的小气道可以被打开，发出响亮的、咔嚓咔嚓的嗡嗡声，以恐吓他们冲锋时的敌人。这种声音使外人将克里恩人称为 \"蟋蟀\"，指的是这种类似蟋蟀的喧嚣。",
	"Artifacts left behind by the Luxon that hold its essence are known as Luxon beacons and are coveted by the Kryn Dynasty as central to their civilization. If a proven soul is ritualistically bound to a Luxon beacon, they can enter a process called the consecution: when a mortal bound to the Luxon dies within a hundred miles of a beacon, the beacon ensnares their soul from its intended afterlife and prepares it to be reborn in a new child within that same vicinity. When that child then matures into adolescence, they begin to recall subtle knowledge from their past life's experiences, a process called anamnesis. Through meditation with a guide, they can unlock the memories of their past lives and become a more complete being. When a soul has cycled enough to believe they are ready to greet the Luxon, they are called an Umavi, or \"perfect soul,\" and are revered within the Kryn society. Some beings that naturally reincarnate, such as the phoenix, are considered holy creatures that carry a shard of the Luxon within themselves.": "卢克逊留下的拥有其精髓的文物被称为卢克逊信标，被克莱恩王朝视为其文明的核心而觊觎。如果一个被证实的灵魂在仪式上被束缚在卢克逊信标上，他们可以进入一个被称为迫害的过程：当一个被卢克逊束缚的凡人在信标100英里范围内死亡时，信标将他们的灵魂从预定的来世中捕获，并准备在同一附近的一个新孩子中重生。当这个孩子进入青春期后，他们开始回忆过去生活经历中的微妙知识，这个过程被称为失忆。通过与向导的冥想，他们可以解开前世的记忆，成为一个更完整的生命。当一个灵魂已经循环了足够的时间，相信他们已经准备好迎接卢克松，他们被称为Umavi，或 \"完美的灵魂\"，并在克里恩社会中受到尊敬。一些自然轮回的生命，如凤凰，被认为是圣洁的生物，它们自身带有卢克逊的碎片。",
	"If a life continues long enough to achieve a state of clarity called achess, where they believe that they've learned all they can learn from their current life, they can choose to partake in a ritualistic termination of their current life, assisted by an Umavi in proximity to a beacon, thereby setting them on the path to a new birth. While considered an honor within the Kryn Dynasty, this practice is misunderstood and seen as barbaric outside their culture.": "如果一个人的生命持续了足够长的时间，达到了一种被称为achess的清晰状态，他们认为自己已经从当前的生命中学到了所有能学到的东西，他们可以选择参加一个终止当前生命的仪式，由Umavi在一个灯塔附近协助，从而使他们走上新生的道路。虽然在克莱恩王朝内部被认为是一种荣誉，但这种做法在他们的文化之外被误解并被视为野蛮的行为。",
	"The Kryn Dynasty is a society restructured from the Lolthite history they rejected. The people of the dynasty stand under the first Umavi, known as Bright Queen Leylas Kryn. Beneath the first Umavi, there are twelve noble Dens that mark families of souls who have lived together through generations: Dens Kryn, Mirimm, Thelyss, Hythenos, Icozrin, Biylan, Tasithar, Duendalos, Daev'yana, Omrifar, Beltune, and Zolaed. When someone is believed to be experiencing anamnesis, they submit to a deep meditation with a guide trained in the ways of consecution. This process helps restore memories of the past life, which then mingle with current memories.": "克林王朝是一个从他们拒绝的洛尔塞特历史中重组的社会。该王朝的人民站在第一任Umavi之下，被称为光明女王Leylas Kryn。在第一任Umavi之下，有12个高贵的Dens，标志着世代生活在一起的灵魂家族。Kryn、Mirimm、Thelyss、Hythenos、Icozrin、Biylan、Tasithar、Duendalos、Daev'yana、Omrifar、Beltune和Zolaed。当有人被认为正在经历失忆症时，他们会在受过迫害方式训练的引导下进行深度冥想。这个过程有助于恢复前世的记忆，然后与当前的记忆混合在一起。",
	"The awakened soul is then reunited with their Den. Dens do grow as new souls enter the consecution and join their ranks, and new Dens are established with each generation. The oldest Dens, especially those helmed by an Umavi, are held in the highest esteem, and generally answer directly to the Bright Queen. The older the soul, the more prestige it holds in the dynasty. Beneath the Dens of Rosohna, guilds and Den representatives govern the other cities of the dynasty that stretch across Xhorhas, spreading the faith of the Luxon and watching over all Xhorhasians who seek the safety of civilization.": "觉醒的灵魂随后与他们的巢穴团聚。随着新的灵魂进入迫害并加入他们的行列，巢穴确实在成长，而且每一代都会建立新的巢穴。最古老的巢穴，尤其是那些由Umavi掌舵的巢穴，受到最高的尊重，通常直接向光明女王负责。灵魂越老，它在王朝中的威望就越高。在Rosohna神殿之下，行会和神殿代表管理着王朝的其他城市，这些城市遍布Xhorhas，传播着Luxon的信仰，并监视着所有寻求文明安全的Xhorhas人。",
	"This seemingly benevolent societal structure does have a dark side. A closely guarded secret of the highest Umavi is a challenge in the consecution called typhros: some souls that have undergone multiple cycles of the consecution are driven mad when their minds cannot reconcile the memories of many lifetimes. Those who fall to typhros are quietly removed from the dynasty and either left in the wastes or mercifully slain away from the beacons. Signs of madness are beginning to show in the Bright Queen herself, but those closest to her do all they can to shield others from such portents.": "这种看似仁慈的社会结构确实有其黑暗的一面。最高Umavi的一个严密的秘密是被称为typhros的迫害中的一个挑战：一些经历了多个迫害周期的灵魂被逼疯了，因为他们的大脑无法调和多世的记忆。那些被逼疯的人被悄悄地从王朝中移出，要么被留在荒野中，要么被仁慈地杀死在远离灯塔的地方。疯癫的迹象开始在光明女王本人身上显现，但那些与她最亲近的人尽其所能地保护其他人免受这种预兆的影响。",
	"It is believed that the Luxon cherishes unity in community, but also values free choice and the power of the individual mind. For each soul to carve a unique path is the best way for a soul to learn about the world. Casting off the teachings of Fate and Destiny taught by some of the current pantheon, the followers of the Luxon are taught that the real power of the universe comes from the power of choice. Many possible futures all await your path, and the universe trembles with anticipatory power as you approach every decision. This power is called dunamis, the energy of potentiality, and the coalescing architecture of the multiple futures leading into each moment is released when an outcome is brought to reality. It is the energy that suffuses every Luxon beacon to prepare the lives to come, and it is the basis of the Kryn's unique divine crafts and arcane abilities.": "人们认为，卢克逊人珍视社区的团结，但也重视自由选择和个人心灵的力量。对于每个灵魂来说，开辟一条独特的道路是一个灵魂了解世界的最好方式。卢克逊的追随者摒弃了当前一些万神殿所传授的命运教义，他们被告知，宇宙的真正力量来自于选择的力量。许多可能的未来都在等待着你的道路，当你接近每一个决定时，宇宙都在颤抖着期待的力量。这种力量被称为dunamis，是潜在的能量，当一个结果被带到现实中时，导致每个时刻的多种未来的凝聚架构被释放出来。它是充斥于每一个卢克松灯塔的能量，为即将到来的生活做准备，也是克莱恩人独特的神术和奥秘能力的基础。",
	"The Kryn Dynasty has uncovered four beacons and is certain that more remain to be discovered. It is believed that once all the beacons are brought together, the Luxon will be summoned from their slumber to ask their children the great question and impart the truth. It is said that at this time, the Luxon will take those who entered the consecution and abandon this lesser world to start a new world elsewhere.": "克林王朝已经发现了四个信标，并确信还有更多的信标有待发现。人们相信，一旦所有的信标被汇集在一起，卢克逊人将从沉睡中被召唤出来，向他们的孩子们提出伟大的问题并传授真理。据说在这个时候，卢克逊人将带着那些进入迫害的人，放弃这个较小的世界，在其他地方开始一个新的世界。",
	"The Aurora Watch legionnaires of the Kryn currently number around 21,600 in total. Around 13,200 Aurora Watch are divided among the cities under the dynasty's protection, with another 3,300 Aurora Watch stationed in and around the capital of Rosohna—formerly known as Ghor Dranas—to keep the peace and defend the region. Approximately 5,100 soldiers are scattered throughout the Underdark beneath Wildemount at different locations of interest, many employing magically controlled purple worms to allow elite units to navigate the caverns quickly. The remainder of the watch is stationed along the border of Western Wynandir to prevent the empire's incursions—and to seize land from the empire as they advance.": "克林王朝的极光守卫军团目前共有约21,600人。大约13200名极光守卫被分配到王朝保护下的各个城市，另有3300名极光守卫驻扎在首都罗索纳--以前被称为戈尔-德拉纳斯--及其周围，以维持和平并保卫该地区。大约有5100名士兵分散在荒野山下的暗黑世界的不同位置，许多人采用了魔法控制的紫色蠕虫，使精英部队能够快速地在洞穴中穿梭。其余的守望者则驻扎在西怀恩迪尔的边境，以防止帝国的入侵--并在帝国推进时夺取土地。",
	"The primary objective of the Kryn Dynasty is to seek out and recover the Luxon beacons presumed to be scattered across Exandria. Not only does each beacon bring them closer to the eventual rebirth of the Luxon, they also help broaden the boundaries of the Kryn society as a new center of the consecution, allowing expansion into new lands and the continued conversion of others. With two of their four beacons now missing, the Bright Queen and her people are desperate to discover more of these sacred artifacts.": "克林王朝的主要目标是寻找和恢复被认为散落在埃克桑德里亚的卢克逊信标。每一个信标不仅使他们更接近卢克逊人的最终重生，而且还有助于扩大克莱恩社会的边界，使其成为新的迫害中心，允许向新的土地扩张，并继续改变其他人的生活。现在他们的四个信标中的两个已经失踪，光明女王和她的人民急切地想发现更多的这些神圣的文物。",
	"The Bright Queen and her fellow Umavi see the strength dormant in the roving beastfolk and goblinoids of Xhorhas, and have taken to teaching these nomadic peoples their ways, helping them build villages under the banner of the dynasty, and converting them to their faith. Even so, not all ruling Dens like the idea of introducing what they consider lesser creatures into the consecution, leading to tensions between the people of Rosohna and the scattered villages in the Xhorhasian wilds.": "明亮的女王和她的同伴Umavi看到了休眠在Xhorhas的流浪兽人和地精中的力量，并采取了教这些游牧民族的方式，帮助他们在王朝的旗帜下建立村庄，并使他们皈依他们的信仰。即便如此，并不是所有的统治者都喜欢把他们认为较低级的生物引入迫害的想法，这导致了罗索纳人与霍哈斯荒野中分散的村庄之间的紧张关系。",
	"With some beacons stolen by operatives of the Dwendalian Empire, the entire Kryn Dynasty has mobilized to retaliate. They are gathering armies to assault Western Wynandir while sending assassins and spies through the subterranean paths of the Underdark, hoping to recover the beacons and simultaneously weaken the evil and blasphemous empire.": "随着一些信标被德温达里亚帝国的特工偷走，整个克莱恩王朝已经动员起来进行报复。他们正在集结军队进攻西维南迪尔，同时派遣刺客和间谍穿越地下城的地下通道，希望能找回信标，同时削弱这个邪恶而亵渎的帝国。",
	"The Kryn Dynasty has spent a generation training and preparing a select group of volunteers to gather information on their enemies and find routes through both political and physical borders. These agents are collectively known as the Lens, a network of spies and infiltrators who can bypass boundaries and assimilate into foreign nations to gather intelligence, help the Bright Queen protect their people, and seek out beacons across Exandria.": "克林王朝花了一代人的时间来训练和准备一批经过挑选的志愿者，以收集关于他们敌人的信息，并找到穿越政治和物理边界的路线。这些特工被统称为Lens，这是一个由间谍和潜入者组成的网络，他们可以绕过边界，同化到外国去收集情报，帮助光明女王保护他们的人民，并在整个艾克桑德里亚寻找信标。",
	"Open war has recently broken out between the Kryn Dynasty and the Dwendalian Empire—a conflict that neither nation can afford to lose.

	"Though the Kryn have remained fairly isolated throughout their history, they are now reaching out to other factions in the hopes of making alliances against the Dwendalian Empire. The Kryn Dynasty has begun hiring mercenaries through the Tribes of Shadycreek Run and purchasing dangerous weapons of war from the Myriad. Rumors of strange magics and powerful relics in northern Eiselcross have reached the dynasty's ears, and they are willing to seek out any potential advantage over their Dwendalian foes.": "虽然克莱恩家族在历史上一直保持着相当的孤立，但他们现在正与其他派别接触，希望能与德文达尔帝国结成联盟。克林王朝已经开始通过沙迪克里克之路部落雇佣雇佣兵，并从迈瑞德购买危险的战争武器。关于艾瑟克罗斯北部的奇怪魔法和强大遗迹的传闻已经传到了王朝的耳朵里，他们愿意寻找任何比德文达尔人敌人更多的潜在优势。",
	"There are many humanoid tribes that roam the southern reaches of Xhorhas that have declined to ally themselves with the Kryn—or to be assimilated by them. While the Bright Queen has allowed them to continue their neutrality for the time being, she watches them closely, lest they be courted by the empire's coin and empty promises.": "有许多游荡在Xhorhas南部的类人部落拒绝与克里恩结盟，或者被他们同化。虽然光明女王允许他们暂时继续保持中立，但她密切关注着他们，以免他们被帝国的钱币和空头承诺所吸引。",

	"Leylas was present when the first beacon was found a millennium ago, and has lived eight lifetimes of intense struggle and self-discovery since. She built the dynasty around her journey, spearheaded the recovery of the four beacons known to the Kryn, and died numerous times in the defense of her people. Leylas Kryn is deeply revered and respected as a mighty warrior, an empathic leader, and the elder Umavi who guides her people in the light of the Luxon. Her behavior has grown erratic at times, worrying her trusted inner circle, but she is far too driven to acknowledge such weakness in a time of war.": "一千年前第一座信标被发现时，莱伊拉斯就在现场，此后的八辈子都在进行激烈的斗争和自我探索。她围绕着她的旅程建立了王朝，带头恢复了克莱恩人已知的四个信标，并无数次为保卫她的人民而牺牲。Leylas Kryn作为一个强大的战士，一个有同情心的领导者，以及在Luxon之光中引导她的人民的长老Umavi，受到了深深的敬仰和尊重。她的行为有时变得不稳定，让她信任的内部圈子感到担忧，但在战争时期，她太有动力了，不会承认这种弱点。",
	"An extremely powerful echo knight and general of the forces of Rosohna, Quana has been Leylas's partner for three of her lifetimes, and five of Leylas's. She is wholly devoted to her people—and her queen. Quana holds a private hope that the Kryn might one day leave the inhospitable wastes of Xhorhas and find a proper place in the world among the other peoples of Exandria. The Bright Queen was once receptive to her ideas, but Leylas Kryn has no time for idealism in this age of war. Quana is disappointed, but she is more worried by the strange shifts in her partner's usually wise and controlled demeanor.": "夸纳是一位极其强大的回声骑士和罗索纳部队的将军，她在莱伊拉斯的三生中一直是他的伙伴，在莱伊拉斯的五生中也是如此。她完全献身于她的人民和她的女王。夸娜私下里希望克莱恩人有一天能离开荒凉的霍哈斯荒原，在艾克桑德里亚的其他民族中找到一个合适的位置。光明女王曾经接受过她的想法，但在这个战争年代，莱拉斯-克莱恩没有时间接受理想主义。夸娜很失望，但她更担心的是她的伙伴平时睿智而有节制的举止中的奇怪转变。",
	"Just over a hundred and twenty years old and still within his first life, Essek is a prodigy who displays an unprecedented talent for the manipulation of dunamis energy. Essek is both respected and feared for his intelligence and cunning, and he carefully plots each step he takes to further his and his Den's climb up the hierarchy of the dynasty. Essek is more interested in dunamancy magic than worshiping the Luxon, and he is strangely excited for the war with the empire. He is eager to use the conflict as an excuse to practice the deadlier aspects of dunamancy, and also curious to see what the powerful minds of the Cerberus Assembly may have gleaned from their research into the beacon they stole.": "埃塞克刚过一百二十岁，还在他的第一次生命中，他是一个神童，在操纵杜纳米斯能量方面表现出前所未有的天赋。埃塞克因其智慧和狡猾而受到尊重和敬畏，他精心策划了每一个步骤，以进一步推动他和他的丹尼尔在王朝的等级制度中攀升。与崇拜卢克松相比，埃塞克对杜纳姆魔法更感兴趣，而且他对与帝国的战争感到奇怪的兴奋。他渴望以这场冲突为借口，练习更致命的黑魔法，同时也好奇地想看看地狱犬议会的强者们从他们偷来的信标的研究中可能收集到了什么。",
	"Having lived a number of lifetimes as an early follower of Leylas, Olomon has settled into this recent life as a massive minotaur, embracing the abilities granted to him on the battlefield and taking his place as a champion on the front lines.

	"Seen by many within the dynasty as a talented diviner and voice of reason, Abrianna is an Umavi nearly as old as the Bright Queen herself. The beloved Skysybil has spent her current lifetime as a goblin, a fact that has drawn both ire and jests from the Bright Queen's court for decades. This experience has given Abrianna a new perspective on the wastefolk under the dynasty's banner; she is now one of the few councilors in the Lucid Bastion who bother to vouch for the goblinkin.": "在王朝内部，许多人认为她是一个有天赋的占卜师和理性的声音，阿布瑞娜是一个几乎和光明女王本人一样古老的Umavi。这位受人爱戴的斯凯西比尔在她目前的一生中都是作为妖精度过的，这一事实几十年来一直招致光明女王宫廷的愤怒和嘲笑。这段经历让阿布瑞娜对王朝旗下的废物有了新的看法；她现在是琉璃堡垒中少数几个费心为妖精担保的议员之一。",

	"The Cerberus Assembly was established nearly three hundred years ago, when strife and competition between warring mage lords threatened to unravel the social order of the Dwendalian Empire. The house leaders of this conflict nearly destroyed one another in what was called the Eve of Crimson Midnight, an arcane battle within the capital of Rexxentrum that leveled two wards of the city, killing hundreds of civilians. At the peak of the violence, a parlay was called, and the mage lords decided to put aside their differences and avoid mutually assured destruction, instead joining as a unified conclave. When brought before the king for judgment of their crimes, they offered an accord to instead officially instate the conclave and submit entirely to king's rule. Taking the name the Cerberus Assembly, a reference to a powerful, historical union of mages during the Age of Arcanum, the mages took the empire to new heights of power and expansion.": "地狱犬议会成立于近三百年前，当时交战的法师领主之间的纷争和竞争威胁到了德文达利亚帝国的社会秩序。在这场被称为 \"深红午夜前夕 \"的冲突中，家族领袖们几乎互相毁灭，一场在首都雷克森特鲁姆发生的奥术战斗夷平了城市的两个区，杀死了数百名平民。在暴力事件的顶峰，人们召集了一次谈判，法师领主们决定搁置他们的分歧，避免相互毁灭，而是作为一个统一的协约国加入。当被带到国王面前审判他们的罪行时，他们提出了一个协议，即正式成立协约组织，并完全服从国王的统治。法师们以 \"地狱之神大会 \"为名，参考了历史上阿卡努姆时代的一个强大的法师联盟，将帝国的权力和扩张推向了新的高度。",
	"In the centuries since, the Cerberus Assembly has subtly ingrained itself within most facets of the empire's government, becoming a force of political and military power that many say could rival the king himself. This reality is not lost on the royal council, and tensions often simmer between the assembly and the Crown. The mages of the assembly are known for their extravagant lifestyles and intimidating history of political and economic control, and much of the populace mistrusts them, though no one dares to cross them or the king. There are eight ruling positions within the assembly, and the families of each member are appointed as lesser members without responsibility, called \"annexes.\" Mages of the assembly wander throughout the empire with little fear of argument or resistance.": "在此后的几个世纪里，地狱犬议会已经巧妙地将自己根植于帝国政府的大部分层面，成为一股政治和军事力量，许多人说它可以与国王本人相媲美。皇家委员会并没有忘记这一现实，议会和王室之间的关系经常紧张起来。议会的法师们因其奢侈的生活方式和令人生畏的政治和经济控制历史而闻名，许多民众对他们不信任，尽管没有人敢于与他们或国王过不去。议会内有八个统治职位，每个成员的家人都被任命为没有责任的次要成员，称为 \"附件\"。议会的法师们在帝国各地游荡，几乎不惧怕争论或抵抗。",
	"Members are elevated into one of the eight major offices on the death of a member that leaves an office vacant, or when a standing member abdicates their position. The remaining members then recommend replacements and vote on the mage to fill the newly open office.": "在有成员死亡导致职位空缺，或有常设成员退位的情况下，成员会被提升到八个主要职位中的一个。剩下的成员再推荐替代者，并投票选出法师来填补新开放的职位。",
	"The assembly plays the long game, working to subtly increase its power across the empire and beyond. Popular decisions are often publicly presented as the will of the assembly, while conflicted issues are tailored to seem purely the \"will of the Crown,\" driving a wedge between the two bodies. The assembly seeks to write history to favor its members as the architects of modern law and culture, with the eventual goal of subverting the power of the king, turning him into yet another puppet of the assembly's goals. Assembly mages believe that only they have the knowledge and talents to truly guide the empire into greatness.": "议会玩的是长期游戏，致力于巧妙地增加其在帝国内外的权力。民众的决定往往被公开表述为议会的意愿，而有冲突的问题则被定制为看起来纯粹是 \"王室的意愿\"，在这两个机构之间制造障碍。议会试图书写历史，使其成员成为现代法律和文化的设计师，最终目的是颠覆国王的权力，将他变成议会目标的另一个傀儡。集会法师们相信，只有他们拥有知识和才能，才能真正引导帝国走向伟大。",
	"Aside from political matters, the assembly is focused on locating and excavating powerful relics and magic lost to the Age of Arcanum. Its members believe that their original namesake was the apex of society across all history, and they seek to reclaim their place as paragons of mortal rule. Thus, all salvaged texts and artifacts of power from that era are to be recovered at all costs.": "除了政治事务之外，该组织还专注于寻找和挖掘阿卡努姆时代遗失的强大遗物和魔法。其成员相信他们最初的名字是所有历史上社会的顶点，他们试图重新获得他们作为凡人统治的典范的地位。因此，所有从那个时代抢救出来的文本和权力的文物都要不惜一切代价收回。",
	"The curious discovery of the power behind the Kryn Dynasty has recently drawn much of the assembly's attention. The mysterious, primal force known as dunamis could change the world's understanding of magic itself—and could even be the key to placing the assembly above all other rulers and nations. In pursuit of this goal, agents of the assembly stole two Luxon beacons from the Kryn Dynasty, though they subsequently lost one to a band of adventurers called the Mighty Nein. The assembly has dedicated immense effort to studying and exploiting this new form of magic, knowing full well that stealing the beacons is what caused the current war in the first place.": "克林王朝背后力量的奇怪发现最近引起了议会的广泛关注。这种神秘的、被称为dunamis的原始力量可能会改变世界对魔法本身的理解--甚至可能是将议会置于所有其他统治者和国家之上的关键。为了追求这个目标，议会的代理人从克里恩王朝那里偷了两个卢克松信标，尽管他们后来在一伙名为 \"强大的尼恩 \"的冒险家那里失去了一个。议会为研究和利用这种新的魔法形式付出了巨大的努力，他们清楚地知道，偷窃信标是导致当前战争的首要原因。",
	"The assembly has worked directly with the king and his chamber for so long that the two factions have become deeply intertwined, frustrating both of them. Though they rely heavily on each other, every smile and agreement barely conceals an undercurrent of venomous loathing. Some members of the assembly feel that it is far too soon to overtly challenge the Crown, while others believe it would be foolish to miss the opportunity the war is creating.": "议会直接与国王和他的议院合作了这么久，两派已经深深地交织在一起，使他们都感到沮丧。虽然他们互相依赖，但每一个微笑和协议都勉强掩盖了毒辣的厌恶的暗流。议会的一些成员认为，公开挑战王室还为时过早，而另一些人则认为，错过战争所创造的机会是愚蠢的。",
	"The assembly has established itself as the more forward-thinking face of the empire to the outside world, with Lord Athesias Uludan going out of his way to upstage the Crown at every diplomatic opportunity, all \"in the name of the king.\" Most foreign officials happily deal with the assembly instead of the Crown, especially those of the empire's closest trade partner, the Clovis Concord. The assembly ensures that such meetings are recounted to the king with embellished tales of their diplomatic success.": "议会已经确立了自己作为帝国在外部世界更有远见的形象，雅典娜-乌鲁丹勋爵不遗余力地在每一个外交机会上抬高王室的地位，所有这些都是 \"以国王的名义\"。大多数外国官员都乐意与议会打交道，而不是与王室打交道，尤其是那些帝国最亲密的贸易伙伴--克洛维协约的官员。议会确保在向国王汇报此类会议时，会美化他们的外交成功故事。",
	"The acquisition of a Luxon beacon and the hunger among assembly mages to unlock its powers have drawn the animosity of the Kryn Dynasty, triggering their attacks on the empire.": "卢克逊信标的获得以及集会法师们对解锁其力量的渴望，引起了克莱恩王朝的敌意，引发了他们对帝国的攻击。",

	"Trent is respected as the acclaimed Propagandist of the empire and the third oldest member of the assembly. Once an instructor at the Soltryce Academy, he only returns every few years to collect young students for his experiments in the mental conditioning that he calls \"awakening.\" Many of these students go mad and are locked away, but those who endure become zealots for the assembly and join the Volstrucker, an elite group of arcane thugs commonly known as Scourgers, who perform the assembly's dirtiest work under Trent's direction.": "特伦特被尊称为帝国著名的宣传员，也是议会中第三老的成员。他曾经是索尔特里斯学院的教员，每隔几年才回来收集年轻的学生，进行他称之为 \"觉醒 \"的精神调节实验。这些学生中的许多人都疯了，被关了起来，但那些经受住考验的人成为集会的狂热分子，并加入了Volstrucker，这是一个精英的奥术打手团体，通常被称为Scourgers，他们在特伦特的指导下执行集会最肮脏的工作。",
	"Ludinus is the oldest and only original member of the assembly, as well as the master of warfare and conflict. Charged with overhauling the military structure of the Dwendalian Empire, Ludinus directed the construction of the garrisons on the Xhorhasian border and often oversees their maintenance. He was one of the mages who survived the destruction of Molaesmyr and fled to Bysaes Tyl, but he saw the opportunity to achieve greatness within the empire and left his culture behind to continue his arcane pursuits. Wise, if emotionless, he bears a deep hatred for the Kryn Dynasty and spares no effort gathering information on their weaknesses and secrets. Ludinus spends most of his time developing arcane weapons of war and shoring up the military might of the empire, while subtly challenging the leadership of Crown Marshal Damurag.": "卢迪努斯是议会中最年长和唯一的原始成员，也是战争和冲突的主人。卢迪努斯负责整顿德文达里亚帝国的军事结构，他指导了霍哈斯边境的驻军建设，并经常监督其维护。他是在莫莱斯米尔的毁灭中幸存下来的法师之一，并逃到了Bysaes Tyl，但他看到了在帝国内取得伟大成就的机会，于是将他的文化抛在脑后，继续他的奥术追求。他很聪明，虽然没有感情，但对克莱恩王朝怀有深深的仇恨，不遗余力地收集关于他们的弱点和秘密的信息。路迪纳斯把大部分时间都花在了开发奥术战争武器和巩固帝国的军事力量上，同时巧妙地挑战了王室元帅达穆拉格的领导地位。",
	"One of the younger members of the assembly, Jenna is known for her business acumen and her extravagant lifestyle. By hiding her nature as a doppelganger and using memory-altering magics at a young age to fabricate a false past, Jenna constructed her human persona from the ground up, leveraging her powers of deception to essentially write herself into history as a Clovis Concord expatriate. She helps oversee central guild business in Rexxentrum under Guildmaster Kai Arness, and helps Exchequer Aethia Drooze organize the collection of tithes through starostas across the empire.": "作为集会的年轻成员之一，珍娜以其商业头脑和奢侈的生活方式而闻名。通过隐藏她作为二重身的本性，并在年轻时使用改变记忆的魔法来制造一个虚假的过去，珍娜从头开始构建了她的人类角色，利用她的欺骗能力，基本上把自己写进了历史，成为Clovis Concord的外籍人士。她在公会会长凯-阿尼斯的领导下，帮助监督雷克森特姆的中央公会业务，并帮助财政官艾西娅-德罗兹通过帝国各地的星际酒店组织征收什一税。",
	"The second-oldest member of the assembly, Doolan is in charge of the study and understanding of abnormal creatures and deviants of arcane creation that might threaten the empire's way of life. She is an absentminded yet brilliant gnome who is obsessed with all beasts, aberrations, and creatures of legend. Doolan imports creatures from around the world to study, disassemble, and use in her attempts to revolutionize magical practices. She resents the Library of the Cobalt Soul, as her reputation has caused them to bar her from their facilities. She wishes to catalog the unstudied horrors of Xhorhas and has covertly obtained the services of the Myriad to retrieve new specimens.": "杜兰是议会中年龄第二大的成员，负责研究和了解可能威胁到帝国生活方式的异常生物和奥秘创造的异类。她是一个心不在焉而又才华横溢的地精，对所有的野兽、反常者和传说中的生物都很着迷。杜兰从世界各地进口生物来研究、拆解，并在她试图革新魔法的实践中使用。她憎恨钴魂图书馆，因为她的名声已经导致他们禁止她进入他们的设施。她希望将Xhorhas的未研究过的恐怖事物编成目录，并暗中获得了Myriad的服务，以检索新的标本。",
	"Athesias's charm and bombastic personality serve him well as a diplomat. His duty is to foster a positive relationship with people of power both within and beyond the borders of the empire. He was originally one of the most effective instructors at the Soltryce Academy, but his penchant for spectacle and his rampant narcissism made him a difficult ally to trust with state secrets. When the office of Diplomatic Union opened, he was quickly and quietly reassigned. Athesias finds great pleasure in ruining or usurping the plans of his counterpart in the Crown's employ, Emissary Lord Zeddan Graf.": "雅典娜的魅力和轰轰烈烈的个性使他很适合做一名外交官。他的职责是促进与帝国境内外有权力的人建立积极的关系。他原本是索尔特里斯学院最有效的教官之一，但他对场面的喜好和猖獗的自恋使他成为一个难以信任的盟友，无法掌握国家机密。当外交联盟办公室开业时，他很快就被悄悄地调走了。阿蒂西亚斯在破坏或篡改他在王室的同行--使者泽丹-格拉夫勋爵的计划中找到了极大的乐趣。",

He is in charge of the curriculum and also watches for any latent powers that may be worth grooming as future allies of the assembly, dangers to be monitored, or prospective minds for Ikithon to conscribe into the Volstrucker. Zivan has rarely had the opportunity to demonstrate his full power, for he is typically busied with keeping the peace between the feuding members of the assembly. Those who have witnessed his true might, however, now know that his words are backed by some of the most powerful magics within the Cerberus Assembly.": "齐万-马戈林从他的父亲，已故的约尔马-马戈林那里继承了校长的职位。兹万担任雷克森特鲁姆的索尔特里斯学院的校长已近20年了。冷静、耐心、安静的气势，齐万以敏锐的眼光在学院的大厅里走动，寻找人才。他负责课程，同时也在观察任何可能值得培养为议会未来盟友的潜在力量，需要监控的危险，或者为伊基顿纳入Volstrucker的潜在思想。齐万很少有机会展示他的全部力量，因为他通常忙于维持议会成员之间的争斗和平。然而，那些见识过他真正威力的人现在知道，他的话是由地狱犬议会中一些最强大的魔法所支持的。",
	"The current headmaster of the Hall of Erudition in Zadash, Oremid is tasked with watching and grooming the next generation of mages and arcane specialists outside Rexxentrum. While he himself is a gentle soul who adores animals, he puts on the façade of a strict man with no sense of humor, which is further enhanced by the elemental influence of his earth genasi blood. He teaches students that failure is not an option, and that emotion is a barrier to one's true ability. Equally feared, respected, and privately loathed by the students (and some instructors), Oremid personally dismisses those who break under his school's curriculum and heaps joyous praise on those who endure their training.": "奥雷米德是扎达什博学堂的现任校长，他的任务是观察和培养雷克森特姆以外的下一代法师和奥术专家。虽然他本人是一个温柔的灵魂，喜欢动物，但他却装出一副没有幽默感的严格的面孔，而他的土系基因人血统的元素影响又进一步加强了这一点。他教导学生，失败不是一种选择，情感是一个人真正能力的障碍。奥雷米德对学生（和一些导师）既害怕又尊重，私下里也很厌恶，他亲自开除那些违反他学校课程的人，并对那些忍受训练的人大加赞赏。",
	"Nearly four hundred years ago, an alliance of the Ki'Nau islanders and foreign Marquesian traders founded a new nation on the tropical Menagerie Coast.

	"Internally, each marquis of the Clovis Concord keeps a tight grip on the shipping and trade that comes though their cities, overseeing all guilds that organize imports and exports and managing a handful of guildmasters that form the backbone of local commerce.

	"After the fall of the Julous Dominion and the rise of the Dwendalian Empire, the concord was eager to reach a diplomatic arrangement with the victorious empire. The empire recognized the difficulty of conquering the Clovis Concord and the challenge of managing their immense network of international trade, and acquiesced to a treaty. This loose alliance has been mutually beneficial for many generations, and the concord city of Nicodranas acts as a common ground for people of both nations. Both imperial Crownsguard and local Zhelezo keep the peace in Nicodranas, and both imperial and concord laws hold sway within the city. While this arrangement occasionally causes strain between the two governments, the marquises of the concord are happy to have the buffer of the empire between them and the ravenous wastes of Xhorhas.

	"Twenty years ago, the Myriad established satellite cells in the distant lands of Tal'Dorei and Marquet.

	"Still reeling from her banishment to the Abyss, Lolth felt a rapid shift in her influence as these drow turned from her. Her fury burned with a poisonous hate, and she seethed in her webs as she plotted vengeance on her ungrateful and treasonous progeny. As time passed and her dark divinity gradually recovered, the Spider Queen set aside her pride in favor of her wish to punish; she began seducing the minds of goblinoids, beastfolk, and the wayward people of the wastes, creeping into their dreams and convincing them to love her, bending them to join in her violent hate for the rising Kryn Dynasty. She found drow who felt spurned by the Dens of the dynasty and preyed on their fears and insecurities, amplifying their xenophobia as the dynasty recruited more and more outsiders to their cause.

	"The Children of Malice aren't numerous, but they are clever, driven, and directed by a god of pure hatred. They established hidden cabals throughout the fringes of Xhorhasian society, forming motley bands of Lolthite bugbears and hobgoblins who raid outlying Kryn settlements. Drow agents of Lolth have infiltrated even the highest echelons of Kryn society, slowly poisoning the dynasty both metaphorically and literally.

	"When the elven city of Molaesmyr unearthed a terrible curse that ruined the Savalirwood, many survivors fled to the north. They endured the blizzards and dangers of the Flotket Alps, clinging to the hope that the withdrawn dwarves of Uthodurn would find enough mercy to aid them.

Social tensions rose as cultural differences and forced proximity placed the denizens of Uthodurn into rising discomfort. This growing divide worried Judessa Fruunast, the queen of the dwarves of Uthodurn. She met with the throneless elven king, Imathan Talviel, and unexpectedly offered to instate a diarchy within the city. Months of deliberation followed as the monarchs discussed how best to establish social harmony, where new homes would be built, and how to expand the discs of the city to fit a more permanent populace. Eventually, the two came to an agreement that the majority of both dwarves and elves felt was fair and tolerable.": "许多年过去了，关于那场粉碎了精灵家园的大灾难的原因的信息很少，每个人都逐渐意识到他们的新情况是永久性的。由于文化差异和被迫接近，乌索杜恩的居民们陷入了越来越多的不安，社会紧张关系也随之上升。这种日益扩大的分歧使乌索杜恩的矮人女王朱德萨-弗鲁纳斯特感到担忧。她会见了无王位的精灵国王伊玛森-塔尔维尔，并出人意料地提出在该城市建立一个君主制。几个月的商议之后，君主们讨论了如何最好地建立社会和谐，在哪里建造新的家园，以及如何扩大城市的圆盘以适应更多的永久性人口。最终，两人达成了一项协议，大多数矮人和精灵都认为这是公平和可以容忍的。",
	"The process of restructuring the stubborn societies of this new Uthodurn forged a long partnership and deep friendship between the two leaders until Queen Judessa's death in 794 PD. Judessa's daughter, Simone Fruunast, took up her mother's mantle, and the bonds of friendship forged in her mother's time flourish under her rule. The benefits that were uncovered through the unity of these disparate cultures birthed new prosperity throughout the city, and the new dual society has grown into a synergistic civilization over the centuries.": "重组这个新乌托邦的顽固社会的过程中，两位领导人之间形成了长期的伙伴关系和深厚的友谊，直到公元794年朱德萨女王去世。朱德萨的女儿西蒙-弗鲁纳斯特继承了她母亲的衣钵，在她的统治下，在她母亲时代建立起来的友谊纽带蓬勃发展。通过这些不同文化的团结所发掘出来的利益，在整个城市孕育了新的繁荣，而新的二元社会在几个世纪以来已经发展成为一个协同的文明。",

Shreds of evidence have been recovered by scouting parties sent into the deadly thicket surrounding the ruins of Molaesmyr to uncover signs of the curse and its origins. However, looters and thieves from Shadycreek Run have discovered the ruins as well, stealing relics and selling them to private interests. These thefts, coupled with recent research indicating that the corruption is slowly spreading, have accelerated the need to find answers to the mystery of the Savalirwood.": "许多历史学家和乌索杜恩社会两半的杰出成员都在调查萨瓦里林持续存在的腐败源头，希望有一天能治愈森林，重新夺回精灵们的家园。侦察队被派往莫莱斯米尔废墟周围的致命灌木丛中，发现了一些证据碎片，以发现诅咒的迹象和它的起源。然而，来自沙迪克雷克（Shadycreek Run）的掠夺者和盗贼也发现了这片废墟，他们偷窃遗物并将其出售给私人利益。这些盗窃案，加上最近的研究表明腐败正在慢慢蔓延，加速了寻找萨瓦里尔木之谜答案的需要。",
	"The growing population of the city has a constant need for more resources, so the diarchy agreed on the need to expand beyond the mountain pass. The village of Uraliss was founded using experimental magic designed to thaw snowfields, with the goal of developing sections of the Rime Plains into farmland.

The dual monarchs then established the northern fishing village of Palebank, which supplies new goods and a coastal outpost in spite of the grueling cold.": "不断增长的城市人口对更多的资源有着持续的需求，因此，二元制国家同意需要向山口以外的地方扩张。乌拉里斯村的建立使用了旨在解冻雪地的实验性魔法，目的是将瑞姆平原的部分地区开发成农田。不幸的是，雪地下的土地变成了无法耕种的岩石，因此该定居点被放弃了。随后，双君主建立了北部的渔村帕勒班克，尽管天气严寒，但该村仍提供新的货物和沿海前哨。",
	"Small vessels built to withstand the icy waters of the Frigid Depths began to explore the shores surrounding the region, discovering the lands of Eiselcross.

	"Anyone who might be from Shadycreek Run is treated as a lowlife brigand and immediately captured and interrogated.

While each family center is usually comprised of relatives by blood or marriage, their employees are also considered to be \"within the family,\" so long as they remain loyal.

	"The Mardoon family is a powerhouse of crime within the Graying Wildlands, thanks to its vast network of foreign contacts as well as its prosperous alliance with the Myriad. Known for relentless business acumen and a love of enforceable contracts, the Mardoons would rather shake hands than swing blades. Even so, when contracts are broken, examples must be made, and such circumstances demand a bloody show. The family fortune is made from brothels, jewels, and the slave trade, often specializing in exotic finds from Xhorhas and beyond.

	"The Uttolot family rose to prominence through a network of familial trade alliances, making it the foremost importer of goods difficult to find this far north of the empire. It controls the gates through the Quannah Breach, and anyone who passes into or out of the region must pay tolls to the Uttolots, making them a necessary partner to the other families whether they like it or not. They dabble in poaching dangerous beasts and monsters, and often clash with the hunters of the Greytrader Union, a collective of citizens who want to improve life for the people of Shadycreek Run.

It lives beyond the boundaries of the city, deep within the Savalirwood, in a network of homesteads surrounding a stronghold. The Trebain family focuses on controlling hunting grounds and harvesting relics from the ruins of Molaesmyr. The family's interests put it in constant conflict with the Uttolot family and the Greytrader Union.

Unfortunately, imperial agents and even spies from foreign powers have successfully infiltrated the Library over the centuries, and some of their attempts to rewrite fact and history in favor of their own interests have succeeded.

However, he failed to read the fine print of the devilish contract—he succeeded in his mission, but his people paid a terrible cost. The empire was indeed repelled, but it was because the lands of the Marrow Valley were brimming with devils and undead. The common folks hid in their homes, and the valley grew unhallowed and gray. In this brief era of terror, a humble priest of the Raven Queen named Trence Orman prayed for a way to protect his flock, his people, and the lands they called home.

Some have strayed, using their skills to amass a fortune, but the heads of the orders deliver swift justice unto those who exploit the people they are sworn to protect.": "克雷特教团的信条要求其追随者将自己的生命投入到猎杀威胁生命神圣性和快乐的怪物中。虽然牺牲很大，但回报是世界上纯洁和美好的持续存在。骑士团努力保护那些无法保护自己的人，使其免受贵族老爷和夫人们看不见的恐怖之苦。大多数人对他们的服务没有什么功劳，除了生活和旅行的手段。有些人误入歧途，利用他们的技能积累财富，但骑士团的负责人对那些剥削他们发誓要保护的人的人给予迅速的正义。",
	"The existence of the Claret Orders is largely rumor and myth in most places, as the orders have no alliance with or allegiance to any standing government or group. The empire is well aware of their presence and makes a point to ignore their heroic deeds while publicizing misdeeds of those few hunters that succumb to the corrupting influence of their powers.": "克莱特骑士团的存在在大多数地方都是谣言和神话，因为骑士团没有与任何常设政府或团体结盟或效忠。帝国很清楚他们的存在，并有意忽略他们的英雄事迹，同时宣传那些屈服于他们力量的腐败影响的少数猎人的错误行为。",
	"Some splinter orders have traveled beyond the boundaries of the empire, seeking more welcoming folk and more unique challenges in lands across Exandria. Still, no matter where the guardians of the Claret Orders travel, they know they will never be free from the hatred of those that misunderstand them.": "一些分裂出来的骑士团已经超越了帝国的边界，在艾克桑德里亚各地的土地上寻找更受欢迎的居民和更独特的挑战。不过，无论克莱特骑士团的守护者们走到哪里，他们都知道自己永远无法摆脱那些误解他们的人的仇恨。",
	"Weeding out the terrors that feed at the edges of civilization, the members of the orders work for little more than the satisfaction of a deadly job well done.": "铲除在文明边缘觅食的恐怖势力，骑士团成员的工作只是为了完成致命的工作而感到满足。",
	"An elderly priest of the Raven Queen who's as revered as he is feared, Jette has a powerful will and a tactician's mind. Jette never makes direct eye contact, and it seems that his attention is scattered among a dozen points at any given time, yet his ability to read patterns and calculate the hidden nature of evil leaves his compatriots in awe. Absolutely dedicated to the eradication of fiendish influence on the mortal plane, Jette has sacrificed much in his pursuit—all who serve him suspect that, one day, he will gladly make the ultimate sacrifice.": "杰特是乌鸦女王的一位年长牧师，他既受人尊敬又令人畏惧，他有强大的意志和战术家的头脑。杰特从不与人直接接触，他的注意力似乎在任何时候都分散在十几个地方，但他阅读模式和计算邪恶的隐藏本质的能力让他的同胞们敬畏。杰特绝对致力于根除恶魔在凡间的影响，在他的追求中牺牲了很多--所有为他服务的人都怀疑，有一天，他将欣然做出最终的牺牲。",
	"A famed blood hunter across the orders, Elias has successfully hunted some of the vilest creatures in all the planes and lived to tell the tale, though his scars show the cost of his victories. In his later years, Elias is now focused on training and mentoring new members of the orders, trying to instill in them morals that anchor them to their better nature.": "作为一个著名的血族猎人，埃利亚斯成功地猎杀了所有星球上一些最邪恶的生物，并活到了现在，尽管他的伤疤显示了他胜利的代价。在他的晚年，埃利亚斯现在专注于训练和指导新的骑士团成员，试图向他们灌输道德，使他们保持更好的本性。",
	"A sarcastic spitfire who joined the orders to help gain control over her lycanthropy, Lilyana has become a masterful blood hunter in an impressively short period of time. She leads many hunts with her keen, lycanthropic senses, and is known for being more personable than most who undergo the Hunter's Bane. Lilyana is spoken of with equal parts irritation and awe within the circles of the orders.": "莉莉安娜是一个尖酸刻薄的人，她加入骑士团是为了帮助控制她的狼人症，她在很短的时间内就成为了一个高超的血族猎人，令人印象深刻。她以其敏锐的狼人感官领导了许多狩猎活动，并以比大多数接受猎人之刃的人更有个性而闻名。在骑士团的圈子里，人们对莉莉娅娜的评价是恼怒和敬畏并存的。",
	"When the lands of Tal'Dorei were ruled by the tyrant Drassig, a hidden society of muses, storytellers, bards, and folk heroes assembled to oppose their despotic king. The Golden Grin has endured since those dark years, and it has secretly guided the just, inspired the common folk, and planted the seeds of discontent and rebellion amid tyranny ever since.": "当塔尔多雷的土地被暴君德拉西格统治的时候，一个由缪斯女神、说书人、吟游诗人和民间英雄组成的隐秘社团聚集起来，反对他们的专制国王。自那段黑暗的岁月以来，金色的格林一直经久不衰，它秘密地引导着正义者，激励着普通民众，并在暴政中播下了不满和反叛的种子。",
	"Each member, known as a grinner, pledges to uphold the ideal that every individual has the power to change the world. They seek out places where hope is faint and the soul grows dim without inspiration, lifting the spirits of the downtrodden and heartening those who feel forgotten. Little is known about the Golden Grin aside from myths and rumors, and its members prefer it this way. The grinners listen for whispers and information using fabricated personas they create when they join the faction.": "每个成员都被称为 \"苦行者\"，他们承诺坚持每个人都有能力改变世界的理想。他们寻找希望渺茫的地方，在没有灵感的情况下，灵魂会变得暗淡无光，他们会提升受压迫者的精神，让那些感到被遗忘的人感到欣慰。除了神话和传言之外，人们对 \"金格力 \"知之甚少，其成员也更喜欢这种方式。格林人在加入该派别时，使用他们创造的虚假角色来倾听私语和信息。",
	"The Golden Grin arrived in Wildemount by following the trade routes from Tal'Dorei to the Menagerie Coast, where its members discovered a land plagued by warring despots. A sect of the Golden Grin has spent the past generation spreading its roots throughout the Clovis Concord. Now firmly established, the Grin has set about undermining corruption within the concord and has begun working their way into the Dwendalian Empire.": "金色格林沿着贸易路线从塔尔多雷来到狂野山庄，其成员在那里发现了一片被战争暴君困扰的土地。金色格林的一个教派在过去一代人的时间里将其根基扩展到整个克洛维斯协约。现在，金格林教派已经牢固地建立起来，开始破坏协约内部的腐败，并开始在德文达利亚帝国开展工作。",
	"The Golden Grin—or simply the Grin—exists to enlighten and inspire, keeping ears and eyes out for the murmurs of tyranny and cruelty and deposing those responsible through social upheaval, or occasionally direct intervention. The idea that each person is capable of great things permeates its mantras and beliefs, and the wandering storytellers of the Grin are known to pay handsomely for tales of local heroes and majestic deeds of courage to add to their repertoire of stories and songs. If the people's hearts grow cold enough to reject words and poems, the noblest of grinners will often rise to the occasion and get their hands dirty to display such an act of heroism themselves.": "金色格林--或者干脆叫格林--的存在是为了启迪和鼓舞人心，对暴政和残忍的杂音保持警惕，并通过社会动荡或偶尔的直接干预来废除那些责任人。每个人都有能力做伟大的事情的想法渗透到了它的咒语和信仰中，格林的流浪说书人被认为会花大价钱购买当地英雄的故事和雄伟的勇气事迹，以添加到他们的故事和歌曲剧目中。如果人们的心变得足够冷漠，拒绝文字和诗歌，最高贵的格林人往往会迎难而上，亲手展示这种英雄主义行为。",
	"The Grin claims no formal allies, since its members never reveal themselves to others except in the direst of circumstances. They uplift and bolster other groups that work with the people's best interests at heart. Some grinners occasionally find their way into government positions, granting them a platform to disseminate the ideals behind their cause. While some may not agree with their rather anarchistic views, grinners are generally regarded as idealistic paragons of individual virtue.": "格林会没有正式的盟友，因为它的成员除非在最糟糕的情况下，否则从不向他人透露自己。他们提升和支持其他以人民的最佳利益为中心的团体。一些磨坊主偶尔会发现他们在政府中的地位，给予他们一个平台来传播他们事业背后的理想。虽然有些人可能不同意他们相当无政府主义的观点，但一般来说，磨难者被视为理想主义的个人美德典范。",
	"The Grin's mischief in Wildemount began relatively recently, so it is largely unknown and able to conduct its work unimpeded; however, those versed in historical lore might know of its deeds and read the signs of its meddling. The Golden Grin currently is seeking an alliance with the Library of the Cobalt Soul to root out the untrustworthy within the Cobalt Soul and align their interests to aid the people of Wildemount.": "金色妖姬在野人山的恶作剧开始得比较晚，所以它在很大程度上不为人所知，能够不受阻碍地开展工作；不过，那些精通历史传说的人可能知道它的事迹，并读出它插手的迹象。金格力目前正在寻求与钴魂图书馆结盟，以根除钴魂内部不值得信任的人，并使他们的利益一致，以帮助怀德蒙的人民。",

	"A warm, gentle soul with blind eyes and a heart overflowing with patience, Shakäste was quick to learn the harsh realities of the world around him. After finding faith in the storms that shake the coast where he grew up, he was gifted with a hummingbird companion that serves as his eyes. Armed with a talent for going unnoticed and powers granted by his willful love of freedom, Shakäste has operated under the name \"Hush\" since joining the Golden Grin, quietly seeking out those in need of a little guidance.": "沙卡斯特是一个温暖的、温柔的灵魂，有一双盲目的眼睛和一颗充满耐心的心，他很快就了解到他周围世界的残酷现实。在撼动他成长的海岸的风暴中找到信仰后，他得到了一个蜂鸟伙伴，作为他的眼睛。夏卡斯特拥有不被人注意的天赋和对自由的执着热爱所赋予的力量，自从加入金格力后，他一直以 \"嘘 \"的名义活动，悄悄地寻找那些需要一点指导的人。",
	"An affluent noble among the upper crust of the Clovis Concord, Duasad is an inheritor of the Keef family's ancient, generational wealth.

	"These days, Duasad has become well known as a powerful empath who uses his psychic talents to help others deal with trauma or seek a more fulfilling path in life. He has become one of the most influential and effective members of the Golden Grin in Wildemount. However, the radical shifts in his clients' life choices have not gone unnoticed, and Duasad is aware that the watchful gaze of the Clovis Concord is now firmly fixed on him.": "这些天来，杜阿萨德已经成为众所周知的强大的移情者，他利用自己的精神天赋帮助他人处理创伤或寻求更充实的人生道路。他已经成为怀德蒙的 \"金色格林 \"中最有影响力和最有效的成员之一。然而，他的客户在生活选择上的根本转变并没有被忽视，杜阿萨德意识到，克洛维协约的监视目光现在正牢牢地盯着他。",
	"The Revelry's allies within the Clovis Concord will tell you that they turned to piracy because of the concord's excessive taxes and unjust laws. Perhaps it began that way, but over time, a movement that began as public dissent turned to lawful protest, which then became violent action. Eventually, a union of disenfranchised salvage ships and trade vessels fought their way into the Dragshallow Reef and violently overthrew the small sanctuary port of Darktow.": "启示录在克洛维协约中的盟友会告诉你，他们转向海盗是因为协约的过度税收和不公正的法律。也许一开始是这样的，但随着时间的推移，一场以公众异议开始的运动变成了合法的抗议，然后变成了暴力行动。最终，一个由被剥夺权利的打捞船和贸易船组成的联盟打进了德拉格浅礁，用暴力推翻了小的避难港Darktow。",
	"After establishing a lawless base of operations on the isle of Darktow, these pirates began stalking the well-known shipping routes of the Menagerie Coast to harry, intimidate, steal from, and destroy passing ships that flew under the concord's banner. Calling themselves The Revelry, these \"free folk of the sea\" have now spent over forty years terrorizing the Lucidian Ocean. With loose morals and a twisted code of honor, they take what they want from less protected targets while living a life of debauchery in the well-guarded haven of Darktow. The Revelry lacks a uniform symbol, instead changing the colors and symbols of its banner regularly to avoid counterfeiting and infiltration.": "在Darktow岛上建立了一个无法无天的行动基地后，这些海盗开始跟踪Menagerie海岸的著名航线，骚扰、恐吓、偷窃并摧毁那些打着和谐旗号的过往船只。这些自称为 \"狂欢 \"的 \"海上自由民 \"现在已经花了四十多年的时间来恐吓卢西德海洋。他们有着松散的道德和扭曲的荣誉准则，从不太受保护的目标身上获取他们想要的东西，同时在守卫森严的Darktow天堂过着放荡的生活。启示会缺乏一个统一的标志，而是定期改变其旗帜的颜色和符号，以避免伪造和渗入。",
	"The Revelry is governed by a collective of captains, all of whom defer to the final word of the Plank King, a capricious monarch who never leaves Darktow. The original Plank King, Hunnis Breeah, ruled for twenty-five years before a goliath named Wyatt Maranoss challenged him for his increasingly lackadaisical attitude—and won. Now Breeah is dead, and Wyatt claims the title of Plank King.": "狂欢号由一群船长管理，他们都听从木板王的最终决定，木板王是个任性的君主，从不离开Darktow。最初的木板国王Hunnis Breeah统治了25年，后来一个名叫Wyatt Maranoss的巨人挑战了他日益缺乏活力的态度，并赢得了胜利。现在布瑞亚死了，怀亚特要求获得木板国王的称号。",
	"While the Revelry's original goal was to scare the concord into revoking their soaring taxes, its charter has changed. The Clovis Concord refused to change its laws, and the pirates found a certain dark joy in theft and murder on the waves. The original members of the Revelry (and now their children) have no plans to return to their former lives as legitimate traders. They intend to maintain and grow their operations across the Lucidian Ocean, while continuing to defend and improve their fortress in Darktow, finding intricate ways of reinforcing the reefs with dangerous traps and impassable barriers.": "虽然狂欢号最初的目标是吓唬协约国，让他们撤销飙升的税收，但其章程已经改变。克罗维斯协约拒绝改变其法律，而海盗们在海浪上的盗窃和谋杀中找到了某种黑暗的快乐。狂欢号的原始成员（以及现在他们的孩子）没有计划回到他们以前作为合法商人的生活。他们打算维持和发展他们在整个琉璃洋的业务，同时继续保卫和改善他们在Darktow的堡垒，找到复杂的方法用危险的陷阱和不可逾越的障碍来加固珊瑚礁。",
	"The Revelry has since expanded their interests beyond mere piracy. Relics and secrets dating back to the Age of Arcanum and beyond are rumored to be scattered all across the coast and the Swavain Islands. Some scavengers have returned to Darktow with proof of such artifacts, and a new kind of aspiring treasure seeker has emerged within the Revelry: one who seeks to plunder from the dead rather than the living. The drive to outdo their fellow sailors has already placed several ships in serious danger.": "此后，\"启示录 \"将他们的兴趣扩展到了单纯的海盗活动。据传闻，可以追溯到阿卡纳姆时代和更久远的文物和秘密散落在整个海岸和斯瓦文群岛。一些拾荒者带着这些文物的证据回到了Darktow，并且在Revelry内部出现了一种新的有抱负的寻宝者：他们寻求从死者而非生者那里掠夺。追求超越同伴的水手们已经将几艘船置于严重的危险之中。",
	"Each member of the Revelry known to the Clovis Concord is considered a major criminal, amassing an ever-growing bounty with each infraction they commit and every ship they raid.

	"Whether it be for glory, for gold, or for freedom from law on the ocean waves, the banner of the Revelry calls many to join the cause.": "无论是为了荣耀，为了黄金，还是为了在海浪中摆脱法律的束缚，狂欢节的旗帜召唤着许多人加入这一事业。",
	"After seizing the mantle of Plank King, Wyatt quickly established his position with displays of tactical brilliance, fair judgment, and brutal retribution. Wyatt is eager to maintain the approval of his captains and often throws bawdy, drunken celebrations for his subordinates and the people of Darktow to offset periods of unrest or frustration. Initially friendly and welcoming to an almost unsettling degree, Wyatt has a reputation for abruptly turning into a cruel and violent dictator when his trust and hospitality are violated.": "在接过木板国王的衣钵后，怀特迅速确立了自己的地位，表现出战术上的高明、公正的判断和残酷的报复。怀特渴望保持他的队长们的认可，并经常为他的下属和Darktow的人们举办放荡不羁的醉酒庆祝活动，以抵消不安或沮丧的时期。怀特起初对人很友好，热情到几乎令人不安的程度，但当他的信任和好客被侵犯时，他就会突然变成一个残忍和暴力的独裁者，这一点是有口皆碑的。",
	"Known to many as the \"Screaming Knuckle,\" Alyson is the loud and joyful captain of the ship The Ill Hand who enjoys a good brawl as much as she appreciates a stiff drink. Paij took to piracy because of her hatred for the Clovis Concord, but she is driven by an uncompromising sense of moral duty to the downtrodden. She never raids civilian vessels, and she does her best to rein in the Revelry's cruelest captains and focus their efforts on those who deserve to have their goods stolen.": "被许多人称为 \"尖叫的指关节\"，阿莱森是 \"病手 \"号船的响亮而快乐的船长，她喜欢一场好的争吵，就像她欣赏一杯烈酒。派伊因为憎恨克洛维斯康科德而走上了海盗之路，但她被一种对受压迫者的不妥协的道德责任感所驱使。她从不袭击民用船只，而且她尽力控制启示录最残忍的船长，把他们的力量集中在那些应该被偷窃的人身上。",
	"While this chapter outlines the major players across the continent operating in ways that directly affect the political landscape of Wildemount, there are numerous smaller factions that can be introduced in your own Wildemount campaigns. Among these lesser powers are countless cabals, cults, and leaderless groups of people who fall under the influence of the numerous Betrayer Gods and other entities who corrupt and manipulate mortals. These may operate on their own or within larger factions, providing challenges, villains, and an element of chaos that can make your Wildemount campaign unique.": "虽然本章概述了整个大陆的主要参与者，他们的活动方式直接影响了荒野山庄的政治格局，但在你自己的荒野山庄战役中可以引入许多小的派系。在这些较小的势力中，有无数的小集团、邪教和无领导的人群，他们受众多背叛者之神和其他腐蚀和操纵凡人的实体的影响。这些人可以单独行动，也可以在更大的派别中行动，提供挑战、恶棍和混乱的元素，使你的荒野山庄战役与众不同。",

The Remnants now seek new ways to restore their god to his promised position of absolute dominance over creation.": "{@b The Remnants}. 当Vecna的身体形态在Arcanum时代被摧毁时，他最忠实的追随者建立了残余者，这是一个秘密教派的集合，致力于实现Vecna的计划，尽管他已经死了，但还是要升到神的地位。该教派成功地帮助他复活和升天，但当《Vox Machina》的英雄们将韦克纳驱逐并封印在神门之外时，他们就被驱散了。遗民们现在寻求新的方法来恢复他们的神，使其恢复到他所承诺的对创造物的绝对统治地位。",
	"{@b The Caustic Heart}. The leaders of the Caustic Heart are dedicated to Tiamat and eager to free her from the hellscape of Avernus. The Caustic Heart uses social leverage and binding contracts, as well as seductive promises of power and vice, to ensnare the weak-willed and greedy within their plots and expand their influence.": "{@b The Caustic Heart}. 苛责之心的领导人对提亚马特忠心耿耿，渴望将她从阿弗纳斯的地狱中解放出来。苛酷之心利用社会杠杆和有约束力的合同，以及诱人的权力和罪恶的承诺，将意志薄弱和贪婪的人诱入他们的阴谋中，并扩大他们的影响。",
	"{@b The Harbingers of the Core.} These aberrant cultists worship the terrors born from the dreams of the Elder Evils: impossibly ancient, malevolent entities who exist within the Far Realm and the spaces beyond the known planes. Touched by madness, their bodies often subtly mutated by their contact with the horrors to whom they pray, the Harbingers of the Core gather in the broken lands of Blightshore to summon and unleash the terrible children of their masters.": "{@b The Harbingers of the Core.}这些反常的崇拜者崇拜从上古邪神的梦境中诞生的恐怖：不可能的古老、恶毒的实体，他们存在于远界和已知星球之外的空间。在疯狂的触动下，他们的身体经常因为与他们所祈祷的恐怖事物的接触而发生微妙的变异，核心使者聚集在Blightshore的破碎土地上，召唤并释放他们主人的可怕孩子。",

Feolinn is a popular destination for wealthy socialites, and it is filled with businesses that specialize in indulgence and self-pampering.": "费林比它最近的沿海邻居要小，它被广泛地称为花园城市，因为它具有乡村的美感，靠近梅花林，以及维护良好的公园和花园。费林是母亲之叹息礁周围丰富的渔场的一个港口，也是希望逃离埃克桑德里亚混乱局面的旅行者的一个目的地。费林是富裕的社会名流的热门目的地，这里到处都是专门从事放纵和自我宠爱的企业。",
	"The abundance of fruit and sweet roots harvested from the Plumgroves has given rise to a competitive wine and spirits industry. Feolinn wines and ciders are renowned throughout Exandria. The vintners of Feolinn are known for their intense pride—and for the disdain they have for other vineyards, such as those in the Dwendalian city of Kamordah. Classic vintages auction well in Port Damali, while high-end liquor is presented as a fine gift in noble circles. Competition between the local wineries and distilleries is cutthroat, with major organizations such as the Soliva Winery, the Laffath & Legrand Vineyards, the Leoleoa Cellars, and the Purple Breast Company all vying for local and international renown.": "从李子树上收获的大量水果和甜根，催生了一个有竞争力的葡萄酒和烈酒行业。Feolinn的葡萄酒和苹果酒在整个Exandria都很有名。Feolinn的葡萄种植者因其强烈的自豪感而闻名--也因他们对其他葡萄园的轻视而闻名，例如Dwendalian城市Kamordah的葡萄园。经典年份的酒在达马里港拍卖得很好，而高端酒在贵族圈子里被当作精美的礼物。当地酒庄和酒厂之间的竞争是残酷的，主要的组织，如Soliva酒厂、Laffath & Legrand葡萄园、Leoleoa酒窖和紫胸公司都在争夺当地和国际声誉。",
	"Feolinn's reputation for vanity is well-deserved; even its leaders believe in their city's superiority. Marquis Hector Soliva of the Soliva Winery family is the third marquis of his bloodline to maintain the city's luxurious image, while also doing his best to elevate the prestige of his family's business. Local Zhelezo are often tipped by businesses to pay particular attention to their safety, or to pry into the affairs of competitors. This culture of bribery has caused Feolinn's Zhelezo to neglect the concerns of their city's underclass in favor of lining their pockets with \"tips\" from merchants.": "费林的虚荣声誉是当之无愧的；甚至它的领导人也相信他们城市的优越性。索里瓦酒厂家族的赫克托-索里瓦侯爵是他血统中的第三位侯爵，他维护着这座城市的奢华形象，同时也尽力提升他家族企业的威望。当地的哲勒索经常被企业拉拢，让他们特别注意自己的安全，或者打探竞争对手的事情。这种贿赂文化导致Feolinn的Zhelezo忽视了他们城市底层民众的关切，而用商人的 \"小费 \"来充实自己的口袋。",
	"Visible, violent, and unbecoming criminal activity is swiftly quelled to avoid tarnishing the reputation of the fair city. However, quiet lawbreaking occurs within back rooms of wineries and the mansions of the upper class. A number of powerful local businesses have even fallen in with the Myriad to unseat their competitors, and though few are aware of it, Feolinn is now nearly as corrupt as Port Damali.": "明显的、暴力的和不合适的犯罪活动被迅速平息，以避免玷污这座美丽城市的声誉。然而，在酒厂的密室和上层阶级的豪宅中也有悄悄的违法行为。一些有权势的当地企业甚至与妙音会勾结，以推翻他们的竞争对手，虽然很少有人知道，但费林现在几乎和达马里港一样腐败。",
	"Buttressed against the southern tree line of the Plumgroves and surrounded by a number of small family farms, Feolinn is replete with rural charm. The city itself is comprised of four main roads that form a large rectangle, with each corner ending in a promenade filled with shops and pubs, while the city center is mostly made up of residential homes and affluent estates. Suamalie Way specializes in food and fine dining, while Alt'afi Avenue sports theaters, bathhouses, gambling halls, and other venues for private entertainment. Minceli Road contains administration buildings and Zhelezo barracks, and Soyer Street is home to many of the local harvesters and working class folk.": "费林紧靠梅林南部的树线，周围有许多小型家庭农场，充满了乡村的魅力。城市本身由四条主干道组成一个大的矩形，每个角落的尽头都是充满商店和酒馆的长廊，而城市中心主要由住宅和富裕的庄园组成。苏亚马利路专门经营食品和高级餐饮，而阿尔特阿菲大道则有剧院、澡堂、赌博厅和其他私人娱乐场所。明塞利路有行政大楼和哲勒佐兵营，索耶街是许多当地收割者和工人阶级的家。",

	"The characters are invited to a citywide alcohol fair, where Feolinn's wineries and distilleries enter their products to compete for prizes. The fair is secretly sponsored by the Myriad, which plans to get the city's most influential people drunk and learn their secrets to use as blackmail. The characters get wind of this plan and must decide whether to stop the Myriad or get in on the plan.": "这些人物被邀请参加一个全市性的酒类交易会，Feolinn的酒厂和蒸馏厂在会上展示他们的产品以争夺奖品。酒会是由Myriad秘密赞助的，Myriad计划让这个城市最有影响力的人喝醉，并了解他们的秘密，以用作敲诈。这些人物得到了这个计划的消息，必须决定是阻止Myriad还是加入这个计划。",
	"After the characters gain recognition for their deeds, the competing wineries and distilleries in Feolinn attempt to convince them to become official spokespeople of their brands, offering money and free booze. If the characters accept an offer, the rejected companies turn on them, trying to embarrass the characters at every turn and hiring rival adventurers to take credit for their accomplishments.": "在人物的事迹得到认可后，Feolinn的竞争酒庄和酒厂试图说服他们成为其品牌的官方代言人，提供金钱和免费的酒。如果人物接受了提议，被拒绝的公司就会反过来攻击他们，动不动就想让人物难堪，并雇佣敌对的冒险家来抢夺他们的功劳。",
	"Tropical weather and fertile lands have enabled Feolinn to develop a prosperous wine trade across the Menagerie Coast and beyond. There is fierce competition between local families as well as the rival wineries of Kamordah in the empire, and the numerous wines exported from Feolinn can claim a respectable bit of coin, though the prices might vary depending on the market.": "热带气候和肥沃的土地使Feolinn在Menagerie海岸和其他地区发展了繁荣的葡萄酒贸易。当地的家庭以及帝国中卡莫达的对手酒厂之间存在着激烈的竞争，从费林出口的众多葡萄酒可以索取到一笔可观的钱财，尽管价格可能因市场而异。",

This well-traveled highway is too long to be constantly patrolled, but small bands of Zhelezo do move from city to city, giving travelers at least the illusion of security. The Gilded Roadway is a symbol of unity between the coastal cities of the Clovis Concord and is even represented on the concord's official seal.": "镀金公路几乎贯穿整个Menagerie海岸，是一条连接Clovis Concord每个主要城市的文明带。这条交通便利的公路太长了，不可能经常有人巡逻，但小股的哲勒索确实从一个城市移动到另一个城市，至少给旅行者带来安全的假象。镀金公路是Clovis协约国沿海城市之间团结的象征，甚至在协约国的官方印章上也有体现。",

	"After the sea guardian of the Ki'Nau was banished, the Menagerie Coast received an influx of travelers from Marquet. Many Ki'Nau of elven heritage joined the desert elves of Marquet to seek a new home. They traveled inland toward the protection of the Cyrios Mountains, where precious metals and stones lay unclaimed, and paid their respects to the fey folk of the Doralle, taking only what lumber they felt was needed. Together, they built a new center for elven culture among the fields outside the forest.": "在Ki'Nau的海上守护者被放逐后，Menagerie海岸迎来了大量来自Marquet的旅行者。许多具有精灵血统的Ki'Nau人加入了马尔凯特的沙漠精灵，寻找新的家园。他们向内陆走去，走向赛里奥斯山脉的保护地，那里的贵重金属和宝石无人认领，并向多拉勒的精灵们致意，只带走他们认为需要的木材。他们一起在森林外的田野上建立了一个新的精灵文化中心。",
	"When the Clovis Concord was established, Gwardan was the force that mandated autonomy between each city-state.

	"The elves of Gwardan built sprawling mines throughout the nearby mountains, becoming the most renowned metallurgists and smiths across the Menagerie Coast. The mingling of elven cultures has occasioned the guarded development of a unique style of metalworking. Blending organic designs with super-heated caustic mists, the \"steamcasting\" process imbues metal with a prismatic shimmer and enables cheap, brittle materials to become as workable and as strong as steel. Gwardan is known across Exandria for its unique steamcast goods, and no one else has managed to get the style quite right, making Gwardan's decor, jewelry, and weapons coveted throughout the world.": "Gwardan的精灵们在附近的山脉中建造了庞大的矿场，成为整个Menagerie海岸最著名的冶金师和铁匠。精灵文化的交融导致了一种独特的金属加工风格的谨慎发展。将有机设计与过热的苛性碱雾相融合，\"蒸铸 \"工艺使金属具有棱镜的光泽，并使廉价的、易碎的材料变得像钢铁一样可加工和坚固。Gwardan因其独特的汽铸产品而闻名于整个埃克桑德里亚，没有人能够很好地掌握这种风格，这使得Gwardan的装饰品、珠宝和武器在全世界范围内受到垂涎。",
	"General city affairs are overseen by the Noldar, a council of four figures who represent the larger facets of Gwardan society. Though the Noldar were established in the interest of fairness, they were forced to select one of their number as their marquis when Gwardan entered into the Clovis Concord. Currently, Marquis Vasan Atrith has led the Gwardan people for just under a century, and is seen as both just and forthright.": "一般的城市事务由Noldar监督，这是一个由四位代表Gwardan社会大方面的人物组成的理事会。虽然Noldar是为了公平而设立的，但当Gwardan加入Clovis协约时，他们被迫选择其中一个人作为他们的侯爵。目前，Vasan Atrith侯爵已经领导Gwardan人不到一个世纪了，他被认为是公正和直率的。",
	"While Marquis Atrith has been willing to allow outsiders to visit and live within the city, rising crime and rumors of the Myriad's return to the Menagerie Coast have set her on edge. Thieves have tried numerous times to uncover the secret process of steamcasting, causing her to increase the number of Zhelezo patrolling the city streets. These Zhelezo were drawn from Port Damali, and their presence has given Port Damali's leaders the power to interfere in local affairs, to the Noldar's consternation.": "虽然Atrith侯爵一直愿意允许外来者在城市中访问和生活，但不断上升的犯罪率和关于Myriad人返回Menagerie海岸的传言使她感到紧张。盗贼们曾多次试图揭开蒸汽喷射的秘密过程，导致她增加了在城市街道上巡逻的哲勒索的数量。这些哲勒索是从达玛利港抽调的，他们的存在让达玛利港的领导人有权力干涉当地的事务，让诺达尔人感到不安。",
	"Gwardan is a beautifully rustic yet elegantly refined city of stained wood and gold that rises from the windswept tallgrass fields, cultivated farm land, and clustered trees of the chilly northern plains.

This ambush poisoned and slaughtered an innumerable number of Melora's chosen. In her anguish and rage, Melora's scream shook the heavens and birthed a twisting, thorny woodland that crushed and consumed the serpentfolk of Zehir, sending the dark god fleeing the valley. The Lushgut Forest remains a physical manifestation of the Wild Mother's vengeful nature; her wrath is embodied in the tall, curling boughs that still ooze toxins from the poison left in Zehir's wake.

A number of small temples are also situated in the Tumbledowns.": "在Tumbledowns，大多数人都住在形状和设计各异的狭窄建筑中，从粘土圆顶到茅草屋，再到扭曲的木头棚子。这些建筑类似于艾克桑德里亚各地文化的混合体，加上棱镜之路，即使在比较破旧的地区也能创造出令人愉快的拼凑气氛。一些小的寺庙也坐落在Tumbledowns。",
	"The Beaded Alley is the center of general commerce and trade within Port Damali, named for the decorative cords that hang over each intersection bearing all manner of streamers and dangling beads. Businesses both young and old all mingle here, competing for the attention of anyone with coin. Many bards and performers bring an air of lively irreverence to the bustling atmosphere.": "珠子巷是达玛利港的一般商业和贸易中心，因悬挂在每个十字路口上的装饰绳索而得名，上面挂着各种形式的流苏和吊坠的珠子。年轻人和老年人的生意都在这里混杂，争夺任何有硬币的人的注意力。许多吟游诗人和表演者给热闹的气氛带来了一种活泼的不敬的气氛。",
	"The ward known as the Crescents was named in reference to the seven large, moon-shaped statues that were a gift from the Alkamar family when the city was founded.

Known as the Golden Chain, it prides itself on having no affiliations, no morals, and no tolerance for failure. Those who can afford its services earn the temporary loyalty of the most ruthless hunters and enforcers on the coast, no questions asked.

Though it's less vibrant than the other coastal cities and jokingly referred to as \"New Othe\" by outsiders, what Port Zoon lacks in liveliness and splendor it more than makes up for in manufacturing and cutting-edge science. Entire districts dedicated to metallurgy and smithing produce some of the best anvil masters in the region, and the majority of the goods and tools created here are sold along the Gilded Roadway to support the rest of the Menagerie Coast. A gargantuan temple to Moradin looms over the city, with large cables that tether his towering statue to other high points across the city. Dangling from these cables are glowing lanterns that light the evening sky with flickering flames.

This agreement has been dutifully upheld over the centuries.": "作为沿海地区原住民的圣地，这对令人惊讶的高大岛屿都是悬崖，没有海滩。虽然周围的水域经常因海浪冲击附近的母叹礁而波涛汹涌，但海边的悬崖上却充满了健康的水果和可以狩猎的猎物。在克洛维斯协约成立之初，基诺人就要求岛屿的自然资源永远保持不被破坏。几个世纪以来，这一协议一直被尽职地维护着。",

Although the garrison successfully repelled the dangers beyond for many years, it fell to a series of clever assaults from the Kryn—they used magic to darken the sky and cause confusion while their forces burrowed beneath the battlements.

Berleben was settled early in the expansion of the Dwendalian Empire, and the town initially showed promise with a booming industry in the cultivation of unique swamp plants sought after by healers and mages alike. However, the watershed from the Silberquel Mountains runs into the Labenda Swamp, and the land slowly grew unstable, causing half of the town to begin sinking into the surrounding marsh.

	"Atop the Stilts region of the settlement lies the Summit House, home to Starosta Carliyle Vesperwind. Vesperwind greatly despises his assignment and quietly resents his inability to protest his appointment.

The empire reached out to the more approachable members of the orc settlement of Bladegarden, offering them wages, resources, and access to imperial goods and services. A number of them became the cornerstone of the eastern branch of the Righteous Brand and emboldened the empire's military techniques with the prowess of the border-hardened orcs. Other orc clans who rejected these ideals were forced eastward into the Brokenveil Marsh and forgotten.": "当朱鲁斯统治区被打败后，不断扩张的帝国将以前在朱鲁斯统治下的游牧民族奥达卡兽人部族视为确保其在东部边境的机会。帝国向布拉德加登兽人定居点中比较平易近人的成员伸出援手，向他们提供工资、资源，以及获得帝国商品和服务的机会。他们中的一些人成为正义品牌东部分支的基石，并以边界坚硬的兽人的能力为帝国的军事技术壮胆。其他拒绝这些理想的兽人部族则被迫向东进入断壁残垣，并被遗忘。",
	"From this accord, the new Righteous Brand training facility in the central Marrow Valley was established. Bladegarden was the site of one of the bloodiest battles of the Calamity; its name referred to the volume of weaponry scavenged by orcs from the war-ravaged earth, and has since been adapted to the idea that warriors are grown within its walls. Bladegarden is both a training complex and the core of orcish society in Western Wynandir. Contests of skill and might are commonplace among the recruits and their trainers. Even the merchants come from sturdier stock and often partake. A sense of honor and pride fills the ranks here, stoked by the rivalry between Bladegarden and Grimgolir.": "从这个协议开始，位于骨髓谷中部的新的正义品牌训练设施被建立起来。刀园是灾变中最血腥的战役之一；它的名字指的是兽人从被战争蹂躏的土地上搜刮来的大量武器，此后被改编为战士在其墙内成长的概念。刀园既是一个训练基地，也是维南迪尔西部兽人社会的核心。在新兵和他们的训练员之间，技能和力量的较量是很常见的。即使是商人，也是来自于更强大的群体，并经常参与其中。这里的队伍充满了荣誉感和自豪感，Bladegarden和Grimgolir之间的竞争激发了这种感觉。",
	"As scuffles with the Kryn escalated and a growing number of dragonborn refugees left Talonstadt to join the military, a certain belligerent mirth filled the warriors of Bladegarden. This oddly jovial wartime atmosphere was shaken when the Xhorhasian assault on the Ashguard Garrison proved far more swift and brutal than anyone predicted. However, now that the surviving Ashguard forces have retreated to Bladegarden and the scattered armies of the empire have moved east to join them, the city is as crowded and lively as ever—but morale is tenuous.

	"Aside from the impressive halls of the sprawling Righteous Brand barracks that loom over the eastern edge of the city, Bladegarden is considered by many a remarkably drab place. The oval settlement is threaded by wandering dirt roads that seemingly stop and start without reason, and there is little color in the streets. Beyond the western walls, there are a number of farmsteads where local produce is gathered to aid in feeding the populace, but the majority of food is brought via cart from other sources across the Marrow Valley.": "除了耸立在城市东部边缘的正义品牌军营令人印象深刻的大厅之外，Bladegarden被许多人认为是一个非常单调的地方。这个椭圆形的定居点被游荡的土路所贯穿，这些土路似乎是无缘无故地停了又停，街道上几乎没有什么色彩。在西边的城墙外，有一些农庄，收集当地的农产品来帮助养活民众，但大部分的食物都是通过马罗河谷其他地方的马车运来的。",

With the Crownsguard overworked, there are also plenty of adventures fighting crime within the city.": "对于站在帝国一边作战的角色来说，Bladegarden是一个很好的行动基地，对于希望潜入敌人队伍的Xhorhasian间谍来说也是如此。由于皇冠护卫队工作过度，也有很多在城市内打击犯罪的冒险。",
	"The Crown sends the Morale Pals, a famous comedic halfling duo, to keep spirits up in Bladegarden. But when the curtain goes up on opening night, it reveals the decapitated bodies of the Morale Pals! The characters are hired to answer the question everyone is asking: who killed the halflings? It might be Xhorhasian {@creature Spy||spies} determined to keep morale low, thieves who wanted the halflings' purses, or perhaps a rogue killer who wanted to send a message to the whole city that this is just the beginning.": "王室派出了著名的半身人喜剧组合Morale Pals来维持Bladegarden的气氛。但是，当开幕式当晚大幕拉开时，却发现了被斩首的 \"士气伙伴 \"的尸体！他们被雇来回答大家的问题：谁杀了半身人？这些角色被雇来回答每个人都在问的问题：谁杀了半身人？可能是决心保持低落士气的Xhorhasian{@creature Spy||spies}，也可能是想要半身人钱包的小偷，还可能是想向整个城市传递信息的无赖杀手，这只是一个开始。",
	"Long ago, the Brokenveil Bluffs were once a section of the Ashkeeper Peaks that linked to the nearby Dunrock Mountains. The mountain ranges were sundered in the final battles of the Calamity, creating two mountain passes—the only land route that connects Eastern and Western Wynandir.": "很久以前，断肠崖曾经是灰烬守护者山峰的一部分，与附近的邓洛克山脉相连。这些山脉在灾变的最后战役中被分割开来，形成了两个山口--连接东、西威南迪尔的唯一陆路通道。",

	"To the east of the Silberquel Ridge, surrounding the juncture between the Glory Run Road and the Crispvale Roadway, the shady Crispvale Thicket marks the center of the eastern valley. A haven from the bustling lifestyles of the empire, the dense elms and tall underbrush shelter a handful of firbolg clans living away from the eyes of the Crown. As long as one sticks to the roads, it's normally a peaceful place to pass through, but the deeper areas of the thicket are stalked by hungry behemoths and bandits.": "在西尔伯克尔山脊的东面，围绕着荣耀之路和克里斯帕尔路的交界处，阴暗的克里斯帕尔丛林标志着东部山谷的中心。密集的榆树和高大的灌木丛是远离帝国喧嚣生活方式的避风港，为少数枞树族人提供庇护，使他们远离皇家的视线。只要坚持走道路，这里通常是一个和平的地方，但灌木丛的深处有饥饿的巨兽和强盗在跟踪。",
	"At the southwestern end of Wynandir, the Cyrengreen Forest hugs the base of the Cyrios Mountains. The forest is the second-largest source of lumber in the empire, with logging companies from Deastok and Trostenwald working the north and south sides, respectively. Most logging is limited to the outer tree line due to dangers in the shady interior of the Cyrengreen. The lush heart of the forest is home to some wilder families who brave the dangers of the forest to live a freer life, as the tax reapers are reticent to visit too often. There are also scores of abandoned cabins scattered throughout the deep woods where it is believed folks were either forced to flee or were killed by the wild denizens of the forest. To stumble on such a site is considered terrible luck; local tales speak of hungry fey spirits and shapeshifting hunters that stalk the dark shadows of the forest in search of prey to toy with. The Cyrengreen Forest is also one of the wild sanctuaries of those cursed with lycanthropy, though the sects of those shackled with this terrible affliction are divided between those who struggle to contain their feral hunger and those who embrace their predatory instincts.

	"While the dangers of the Cyrengreen include the more common threats such as subterranean ankheg nests and packs of displacer beasts, mischievous fey also call the forest home, wading through errant moonbeams on bright evenings in search of distraction.

	"Travelers in the Truscan Vale find the city of Deastok at the southwestern edge of the Dwendalian Empire. The sister city of Kamordah to the north, Deastok is a borough that appears unusually affluent for its size, largely because the Truscan family has called the city home for many generations. Fine cobblestone streets connect numerous modern buildings and charming country shops, while elegant entertainment venues and picturesque views make the city a quaint holiday location for many wealthy travelers.": "在特鲁斯卡谷地的旅行者发现迪亚斯托克市位于德文达尔帝国的西南部边缘。作为北部卡莫达的姐妹城市，迪亚斯托克是一个就其规模而言显得异常富裕的行政区，这主要是因为特拉斯坎家族世代以该市为家。精致的鹅卵石街道连接着众多的现代建筑和迷人的乡村商店，而优雅的娱乐场所和如画的风景使这座城市成为许多富裕的旅行者的古朴的度假地点。",
	"While Starosta McGinneas is the Crown-appointed leader of the city, it is no secret that the Truscan family is the real guiding force in Deastok.

The Grimgolir reputation for martial excellence soon reached the ears of the Dwendalian military, and the Crown made overtures to the ruling elders of the Grimgol dwarves, inviting them to peacefully become citizens of the empire. The negotiations were nearly spoiled by the Crown's simultaneous courtship of the orcs of Bladegarden, but a concordance was eventually reached. The empire granted Grimgolir an extremely generous trade agreement and all the benefits of imperial citizenship, along with unprecedented autonomy for an imperial vassal state, in exchange for the ability to marshal the Grimgol warriors to fight for the empire. As part of the empire's unified eastern front against Xhorhas, Grimgolir has aided in the training of the soldiers of Bladegarden, as well as the Rockguard and Ashguard Garrisons.": "所有来自格林戈里尔的士兵都有他们第一次沿着断壁崖巡逻的故事。每个新兵的第一站都是在令人眼花缭乱的悬崖之上，作为对Xhorhas的恶劣地形和下面沼泽中游荡的怪兽的介绍。格林戈尔人在武术方面的声誉很快就传到了德文达尔军方的耳朵里，王室向格林戈尔矮人的统治者长老们提出了建议，邀请他们和平地成为帝国的公民。谈判几乎被王室同时向布拉德加登的兽人求爱所破坏，但最终还是达成了一致意见。帝国给予了格林戈里尔极其慷慨的贸易协议和帝国公民的所有福利，以及一个帝国附庸国前所未有的自治权，以换取调集格林戈尔战士为帝国作战的能力。作为帝国统一的东部战线的一部分，格雷戈里尔协助训练布拉德加登的士兵，以及岩石卫队和灰烬卫队的驻军。",
	"Life under the mountain has never been easy. Every bountiful cavern is home to a deadly beast, and ancient tunnels once used by the armies of the Betrayer Gods now are haunted by lingering evils. This has shaped the core value of Grimgol society: to succeed is to struggle. Worth in oneself is measurable by what one has overcome. This has built a philosophy that breeds generation after generation of dwarves seeking ways to challenge themselves and prove their capability. Everyone born within the city learns the basics of armed and unarmed combat as a child—often making outsiders, merchants, and travelers somewhat uneasy with the knowledge that any native Grimgoliran could take them in a fight.": "山下的生活从来都不轻松。每个富饶的洞穴都是致命野兽的家，曾经被背叛者之神的军队使用的古老隧道现在被挥之不去的邪恶所困扰。这形成了格林戈尔社会的核心价值观：成功就是奋斗。一个人的价值是可以通过他所克服的困难来衡量的。这建立了一种哲学，孕育了一代又一代的矮人，他们寻求挑战自我和证明自己能力的方法。每个出生在这个城市的人从小就学习武装和非武装战斗的基本知识--这往往使外来者、商人和旅行者感到不安，因为他们知道任何一个土生土长的格林戈里人都可以在战斗中打败他们。",
	"Early combat training combined with a cultural reverence for wars of ages past creates immense pressure for native-born Grimgolirans to join the city-state's military: the Monoliths. This is especially true for the Grimgol dwarves, for most can trace their family lineage back to a famous warrior or two. However, other Grimgolirans find their calling as storytellers and artisans. Those unable to make a living as a warrior or as an artisan often find themselves as laborers in the service of the Bleeding Stone Syndicate, a massive business enterprise that controls the entire pipeline of ore excavation to weapon manufacture. The Bleeding Stone maintains mining facilities beneath the Dunrock Mountains, a network of railcart lines between the mines and Grimgolir, a cutting-edge blast furnace for ore smelting, and an army of smiths hammering ingots into blades, shields, and mail.": "早期的战斗训练与对过去战争的文化崇敬相结合，为土生土长的格里高利人加入城邦的军队创造了巨大的压力：巨石军团。这对格里高尔矮人来说尤其如此，因为大多数人的家族血统可以追溯到一两个著名的战士。然而，其他格林戈尔人发现他们的使命是讲故事的人和工匠。那些无法以战士或工匠身份谋生的人通常会发现自己是为出血石集团服务的劳工，这是一个庞大的商业企业，控制着从矿石挖掘到武器制造的整个管道。流血石集团在敦罗克山下维持着采矿设施，在矿区和格林戈里尔之间有一个轨道车网络，一个用于矿石冶炼的尖端高炉，以及一支将钢锭敲打成刀片、盾牌和邮件的铁匠军队。",
	"The agreement between the Crown and Grimgolir is the only treaty that has ever guaranteed a city-state autonomous rule while under the empire's banner. While Grimgolir does indeed have an appointed starosta, currently Starosta Ichabod Ashelon, the treaty between Grimgolir and the empire relegates the starosta to little more than an advisor of the ruling Underbaron of Grimgolir. As such, Underbaron Brock Dummaroff oversees the city and its goals with his own council and appointed officials. This arrangement has caused a few frustrations on both sides, and with the war against the Kryn now in full swing, these disagreements continue to grow larger and more frequent.": "王室与格林戈里尔之间的协议是唯一一个保证一个城邦在帝国旗帜下自主统治的条约。虽然格林戈里尔确实有一个指定的星际长官，目前是星际长官伊卡博德-阿谢隆，但格林戈里尔和帝国之间的条约将星际长官降格为格林戈里尔执政的副邦长的顾问而已。因此，Underbaron Brock Dummaroff用他自己的议会和任命的官员来监督这个城市和它的目标。这种安排给双方都带来了一些挫折，而且随着对克里恩的战争全面展开，这些分歧继续扩大，也更加频繁。",
	"Culturally, denizens of Grimgolir genuinely believe that crime is a waste and a dark mark on one's life's work. If someone struggles, others lift them up until they can walk on their own. As such, it is very rare for an individual raised in Grimgol society to turn to a life of crime unless absolutely necessary. There is some criminal activity within and around the city, but most of it is helmed by foreign, outside forces.": "在文化上，格林戈里的居民真正相信，犯罪是一种浪费，是一个人一生工作中的黑暗印记。如果有人挣扎，其他人就会把他们扶起来，直到他们能够独立行走。因此，在格林戈尔社会中长大的人很少会转向犯罪的生活，除非有绝对必要。城市内部和周围有一些犯罪活动，但大部分是由外国的外部势力控制的。",
	"From outside, Grimgolir is an impressive series of battlements and crenelations built into the side of the Dunrock Mountains, with granite staircases and bridges adjoining them. Within the mountain, the city is divided into two massive, cavernous wards, one sitting at an angle above the other in a gradual grade.": "从外面看，格林戈里尔是一系列令人印象深刻的垛口和石榴裙，建在敦罗克山的一侧，花岗岩楼梯和桥梁与之相接。在山中，这座城市被分为两个巨大的洞穴区，其中一个以一定的角度坐在另一个上面，呈渐进式排列。",
	"The interior cavern of the top ward, known as the Cage Ward, resembles a giant, angled ribcage. The Cage Ward contains numerous levels of structures that house civilians, businesses, and guard posts for Monoliths to watch over the area. Farther down the sloping tunnels lies the Heart Ward, a gargantuan, spherical cavern with dozens of elevated walkways crossing at multiple heights, connecting many of the hundreds of open tunnels. The Heart Ward is the hub of all mining and gathering operations throughout the mountain, surrounded by Monolith barracks embedded in the outer edges of the ward. Many barracks adjoin wide tunnels that breach the surface at the base of the mountain, with the exit point heavily guarded and shrouded in illusory stone to prevent discovery.": "顶层病房的内部洞穴被称为 \"笼子病房\"，类似于一个巨大的、有角度的肋骨。笼子区包含许多层建筑，这些建筑是平民、企业和巨石看守区的岗哨的住所。沿着倾斜的隧道往下走，就是心脏区，这是一个巨大的球形洞穴，有几十条高架人行道在多个高度交叉，连接着数百条开放式隧道中的许多条。心区是整个山中所有采矿和采集作业的枢纽，周围是嵌在心区外围的巨石营房。许多兵营毗邻宽阔的隧道，这些隧道在山脚下突破地表，出口处有重兵把守，被虚幻的石头所笼罩，以防止被发现。",
	"With monsters aplenty and war at its doorstep, Grimgolir has no shortage of adventures.": "由于怪物众多，战争在即，格林戈里尔不乏冒险。",
	"Monsters are killing Grimgolir's miners. The typically tough and unbeatable Grimgolir soldiers can't seem to find the creatures. Looking for a fresh perspective, they hire the characters to hunt the monsters in the abandoned mine while operations are shutdown. The monsters are {@creature Mimic||mimics} that turn into pickaxes, railcars, and other mining equipment. They strike at the characters with hit-and-run tactics, retreating into darkness and using their unique powers to blend in with the environment.": "怪物正在杀害Grimgolir的矿工。典型的强硬和不可战胜的Grimgolir士兵似乎无法找到这些生物。为了寻找一个新的视角，他们雇佣了这些人物，让他们在废弃的矿井中猎杀怪物，同时关闭运营。这些怪物是{@creature Mimic||mimics}，会变成镐头、轨道车和其他采矿设备。它们用打了就跑的战术袭击人物，退到黑暗中，用它们独特的力量与环境融为一体。",
	"While the characters are in Grimgolir, several {@creature Purple Worm||purple worms} tunnel into the city, causing mass destruction. After the worms are killed or driven off, Kryn forces come through the tunnels created by the monstrosities, razing strategic military outposts while the city is already in disarray. The Kryn Dynasty knows how critical the city is to training Dwendalian troops, so they mobilized the worms and followed behind to deal Grimgolir a decisive blow.": "当人物在格林戈里尔时，有几个{@creature Purple Worm||purple worms}隧道进入城市，造成大规模的破坏。在虫子被杀或被赶走后，克莱恩部队通过这些怪物创造的隧道来到这里，在城市已经陷入混乱的情况下夷平了战略军事哨所。克林王朝知道这座城市对训练德文达利军队是多么的关键，所以他们调动了虫子，跟在后面，给格林戈里尔以决定性的打击。",
	"Platinum is as rare as it is beautiful, so when a very bountiful vein of the precious metal was discovered east of Deastok within the bounds of the Julous Dominion, the greedy lust for such a financial wellspring finally pushed the empire to break their agreements and conquer the dominion. Within the Crown's control, a vast mine has since expanded to extract the extremely valuable metal. However, the mine's proximity to the tenacious ankheg population that infests the Cyrengreen Forest continues to be a challenge. In addition, the Myriad has slowly infiltrated the operations of the mines over the past fifty years, regularly skimming from the platinum haul to fund its endeavors.": "铂金既稀有又美丽，所以当在朱鲁斯领地范围内的迪亚斯托克东部发现了一个非常丰富的贵重金属矿脉时，对这样一个金融泉源的贪婪欲望最终促使帝国打破协议，征服了该领地。在皇室的控制下，一个巨大的矿场从此扩大，以提取极其宝贵的金属。然而，该矿靠近侵扰赛伦格林森林的顽强的安克希格人，这仍然是一个挑战。此外，在过去的50年里，妙手党慢慢地渗透到了矿场的运作中，经常从铂金的运输中抽出资金来资助其工作。",

	"The gnomish community of Hupperdook is built along the eastern base of the Silberquel Ridge, marked by the ever-rising columns of dark smoke and steam.

This smoke-stacked city is now the heart of industry in the empire, manufacturing technological marvels and large-scale weapons of war for the Dwendalian Empire.": "侏儒社区Hupperdook是沿着Silberquel山脊的东部基地建造的，以不断上升的黑烟和蒸汽柱为标志。在帝国之前，胡珀杜克一直保持自治，直到两个多世纪前王室通过外交协议吸收了这个社区。这个烟雾缭绕的城市现在是帝国的工业中心，为德文达尔帝国制造技术奇迹和大型战争武器。",
	"The gnomish culture within Hupperdook prizes hard work and hard play. Family trades vary from coal mining and clockwork development to practical enchantment and the brewing of zesty libations.

	"For as long as the people of Hupperdook have lived on the mountain, they've been pushing to better their respective trades. The ten-hour work days are long and sometimes arduous, as sparks fly and clangs of metal ring through the city, but when dusk comes, the whistles blow and the carousing begins. Nearly every evening is a wild party celebrating the end of a productive day. Music, fireworks, dancing, and lots and lots of alcohol have given Hupperdook a reputation as one of the rowdiest locales within the empire. Such a lifestyle can be taxing on folk not used to such grueling labor and formidable merriment, but as the saying goes, \"ya come here for an early grave worth earning.\"": "只要Hupperdook的人住在山上，他们就一直在努力改善各自的行业。十个小时的工作时间是漫长的，有时也是艰苦的，因为火花四溅，金属撞击声响彻整个城市，但当黄昏来临，哨声响起，狂欢开始。几乎每个晚上都是一个疯狂的聚会，庆祝一天生产的结束。音乐、烟花、舞蹈和大量的酒精让胡珀杜克享有帝国内最热闹的地方之一的声誉。这样的生活方式对不习惯这种艰苦劳动和可怕的欢乐的人来说是一种负担，但正如人们所说的，\"你来这里是为了早日找到一个值得赚取的坟墓。\"",
	"The traditional nighttime drink is called fuse, a mixture of strong liquor and an energy-boosting herbal concoction that is considered by the hardest workers as a necessity to properly embrace an evening of revelry, though some visitors complain of the rather unpleasant aftermath of imbibing the powerful substance.

	"The Crown understands the benefit of keeping Hupperdook and its citizens happy through relative autonomy, as no other city can develop and produce weapons like the ones found here.

Finished implements of war are shipped across the valley to Bladegarden or Rockguard Garrison, with a few left stockpiled within the city.": "王室明白通过相对自治使Hupperdook和它的公民保持快乐的好处，因为没有其他城市可以开发和生产像这里的武器。Hupperdook的工业有相当大的一部分被分配到防御武器、攻城引擎和火器的生产和开发上。完成的战争工具被运到山谷对面的布拉德加登或岩石守卫军，还有一些被储存在城市里。",

Home to swamp beasts and malevolent forces drawn to the mystic secrets buried beneath the algae and stones, this lake is a source of myths for folk all across the Marrow Valley. Many speak of the temple that once sat at its northern shore before the quaking of the Calamity sent it sinking down into the dark water. Others tell tales of the Marsh Siren who calls to people in their dreams and draws them into the swamp with her song. These unfortunate souls are lost to the marsh, or they drown in her embrace beneath the waters. Most who discuss the Ounterloch, however, just speak of how miserable it is.": "在拉本达沼泽的中心，奥恩特洛赫长满苔藓的绿色水域是咸水和污浊的。这个湖泊是沼泽野兽和邪恶力量的家园，它们被埋藏在海藻和石头下的神秘秘密所吸引，是整个骨髓谷的民间神话的来源。许多人说起曾经坐落在北岸的神庙，在灾难的震荡使它沉入黑暗的水中之前。还有人讲述沼泽海妖的故事，她在人们的梦中呼唤他们，用她的歌声吸引他们进入沼泽。这些不幸的灵魂失去了沼泽，或者在她的怀抱中淹死在水底下。然而，大多数讨论Ounterloch的人只是说它是多么的悲惨。",

While many remained to rebuild from the ruins of the fallen city, dozens of ravenite refugees and survivors fled across the dangerous lands of Xhorhas, climbing over the mountains into the Marrow Valley.

Many attribute the distinctive flavor to the waters of the nearby Ustaloch, while others attribute the flavor to an enchantment on the nearby soils hearkening back to the Age of Arcanum. Regardless, the ale has become the flagship export for the settlement, causing tension between competing families.

The growing hum of unrest makes him increasingly nervous.": "大部分的日常事务和政治是由Starosta Wyatt Fedar、Lawmaster Orentha Stonegrasp和High-Richter Dolan Thyme监督的，他们必须紧密合作来管理这个庞大的、无垠的城市。然而，众所周知，Starosta深陷城市最富有的家族的口袋，并且经常被这些势力操纵，不把人民的最佳利益放在心里。社区领导人对Starosta的腐败感到愤怒是理所当然的，但Starosta Wyatt发现很难获得首都的支持，因为首都正专注于与Xhorhas的战争。越来越多的骚乱使他越来越紧张。",
	"Criminal elements are part of the very fabric of the city. Independent swindlers make their way through the poorer districts, pickpocketing freely behind the backs of overworked Crownsguard. The Myriad has patsies in every industry and most political offices, too.": "犯罪分子是这个城市结构的一部分。独立的诈骗犯在贫困地区大行其道，在劳累过度的皇冠卫士的背后随意扒窃。Myriad在每个行业和大多数政治办公室都有傀儡。",
	"A crime boss known in some circles as the Gentleman runs a thieves' guild based in a network of underground tunnels called the Underworks. Crime is extremely profitable in Zadash, and has been fine-tuned for generations to be efficient, hard to trace, and largely invisible to the untrained eye.": "一个在某些圈子里被称为 \"绅士 \"的犯罪头目在一个名为 \"地下工程 \"的地下隧道网络中经营着一个盗贼公会。在扎达什，犯罪是非常有利可图的，而且经过几代人的微调，效率很高，难以追踪，而且未经训练的人基本上看不到。",
	"Zadash has a mix of older Julous architecture and modern Dwendalian construction, giving the picturesque, triangular city a varied and mismatched look. Zadash is broken into five major districts: the Outersteads, the Pentamarket, the Innerstead Sprawl, the Tri-Spires, and the Signet Wall.": "扎达什混合了古老的朱鲁斯建筑和现代的德文达尔建筑，使这座风景如画的三角形城市具有不同的、不匹配的外观。扎达什被分成五个主要区域：外城、五角场、内城、三角场和标志墙。",
	"Divided into the East and West Outersteads, this area is home to the poor and powerless of the city, a collection of slums and neighborhoods of hovels that cluster around and beyond the city walls. The majority of folks who live within these areas are humble crafters hoping to catch the eye of traders passing through, workers who handle the less desirable careers that keep the city functioning, or the destitute who are trying to regain control of their lives. Many sections are humble but welcoming, with family communities who work together to keep the peace when the Crownsguard are too sparse or too uncaring to watch over them. The regions beyond the walls are equal parts farming communities and tent cities. However, some areas of the Outersteads have become hotbeds for criminal activity, with locals disappearing often enough to cause discontent with the empire's indifference.": "这个地区分为东外滩和西外滩，是城市中穷人和无权无势者的家园，是城墙周围和城墙外的贫民窟和街区的集合。住在这些地区的大多数人都是希望吸引过往商人目光的卑微手艺人，处理维持城市运转的不太理想的职业的工人，或者试图重新控制自己生活的赤贫者。许多地区都很简陋，但却很受欢迎，当皇冠卫士太过稀少或太不关心他们的时候，他们的家庭社区就会一起努力维持和平。城墙外的地区是由农业社区和帐篷城市组成的。然而，外城的一些地区已经成为犯罪活动的温床，当地人经常失踪，足以引起人们对帝国的冷漠的不满。",
	"The Pentamarket is the bustling heart of commerce, a massive bazaar that rests at the junction of the city's five main roads. Here, all manner of guild shops and businesses provide both wares and lodging for droves of weary travelers. During many calendar holidays, this region of the city is flamboyantly decorated, and music and games fill the streets surrounding the crafters' temple, Hearth of the All-Hammer, and the massive gladiatorial arena known as the Victory Pit.": "五角市场是繁华的商业中心，一个巨大的集市，位于城市五条主要道路的交界处。在这里，各种行会商店和企业为成群结队的疲惫的旅行者提供商品和住宿。在许多节日里，城市的这一地区被装饰得非常华丽，音乐和游戏充斥着手工业者的庙宇、万锤之炉和被称为胜利之坑的巨大角斗场周围的街道。",
	"A labyrinth of houses owned by the working-class people of Zadash, the Sprawl bends between the other districts, acting as the boundary between them. Except for a few of the temples, such as the Valley Archive of the Cobalt Soul, the Platinum House, and the King's Hall, much of the architecture is simple and built for function.": "由扎达什工人阶级拥有的房屋组成的迷宫，蔓延区在其他地区之间弯曲，充当了它们之间的边界。除了少数寺庙，如钴魂谷档案馆、白金屋和国王大厅，大部分建筑都很简单，是为功能而建。",
	"The Tri-Spires are known throughout the walls of Zadash as the neighborhood of the noble elite and the wealthy. Built on the ruins of the old Pious District after the fall of the Julous Dominion, the Tri-Spires now stand as the center of aristocracy and higher learning within the city—and, indeed, throughout the empire, second only to Rexxentrum. The region takes its name from the three large, uniquely constructed towers that lord over the skyline: the Zauberspire, the Constellation Bridge, and the Triumph Chime. The Zauberspire is the central tower of the Halls of Erudition, a beautiful ivory campus that is an extension of the Soltryce Academy. The Constellation Bridge looms over the Gilded Willows neighborhood as an extremely tall, thin watchtower that offers an incredible view of the entire city and the Marrow Valley beyond. Once a temple to Avandra, The Triumph Chime is now a squat, seven-story belfry outfitted with sleeping chambers, bars, and a raucous gambling hall.": "三尖塔是整个扎达什城墙上著名的贵族精英和富人的街区。在朱鲁斯统治区沦陷后，三尖塔建在旧的虔诚区的废墟上，现在是城市中贵族和高等学府的中心--事实上，在整个帝国，仅次于雷克辛特姆。该地区的名字来自于三座建造独特的大塔，它们占据着天际线：Zauberspire、Constellation Bridge和Triumph Chime。Zauberspire是博学殿堂的中心塔，这是一个美丽的象牙校园，是索特里斯学院的延伸。星座桥耸立在镀金柳树区，是一座极高的薄型瞭望塔，可以看到整个城市和骨髓谷的惊人景色。凯旋风铃曾经是阿凡达的神庙，现在是一个蹲在地上的七层钟楼，配备了寝室、酒吧和喧闹的赌博厅。",
	"The Signet Wall encloses the eastern end of the city and houses Zadash's reserve force of Righteous Brand soldiers. The Signet Ramparts are a collection of four simple stone and wood buildings that act as barracks and living quarters for all local Crownsguard. The clangs of training blades and blacksmiths' hammers fill the air for half the day, while drinking songs and bawdy rhymes fill the other half. Beyond those grounds lies the dark stone entrance to the impressive, eight-floor, subterranean prison known as the Umber Dungeon, where criminals from the streets of Zadash are held and punished, with the most dangerous imprisoned in the deepest cells. The Shrine of the Dawn, a temple of pale stone and stained glass dedicated to Pelor the Dawn Father, where both civilians and soldiers can worship, marks the center of the district. The eastern wall ends in the Marrow Keeps of the Righteous Brand, a massive stronghold surrounded by a half-dozen smaller fortifications that make up the southern bastion of the Crown's military power.": "标志墙包围了城市的东端，是扎达什的义牌士兵的后备力量。标志墙是由四座简单的石头和木头建筑组成的，作为所有当地皇冠卫士的军营和生活区。训练用的刀片和铁匠的锤子的叮当声充斥着半天的空气，而酒歌和粗俗的韵律则充斥着另一半。在这些场地之外，是令人印象深刻的八层地下监狱的黑石入口，被称为 \"琥珀地牢\"，来自扎达什街道的罪犯在这里被关押和惩罚，最危险的人被囚禁在最深的牢房里。黎明神殿是一座由苍白的石头和彩色玻璃组成的寺庙，供奉着黎明之父佩洛尔，平民和士兵都可以在这里进行崇拜，它标志着该区的中心。东边的城墙在正直品牌的骨髓堡垒中结束，这是一个巨大的堡垒，周围有半打较小的防御工事，构成了王室军事力量的南部堡垒。",
	"There are few locations in the empire where enchantments and arcane protections are readily available for sale, as the cost of such devices is prohibitive for the majority of the populace. Most recovered magic items find their way to black markets, are sold through auction houses, get taken by deft thieves, or wind up in the collection of some affluent family.": "在帝国中，很少有地方可以随时出售魔法和奥术保护，因为这种设备的成本对大多数人来说是难以承受的。大多数被回收的魔法物品都会进入黑市，通过拍卖行出售，被狡猾的小偷拿走，或者被一些富裕的家庭收藏。",
	"This makes the success of the Invulnerable Vagrant, one of the few magic item retailers in Wildemount, unique.

If the starosta refuses, the Myriad asks the characters to run amok, causing and inspiring as much chaos as possible until the starosta relents.": "这些人物被雇佣或被Myriad勒索，以说服Starosta Wyatt Fedar让Myriad平息城市的动乱，以换取城市领导人的青睐。如果Starosta接受了，Myriad就会要求这些角色打击城市中的非Myriad犯罪。如果Starosta拒绝，Myriad就会要求角色肆意妄为，造成并激发尽可能多的混乱，直到Starosta松口。",
	"The characters are in Zadash when several monsters are freed from their confines in the Victory Pit. These monsters—an {@creature abominable yeti}, a {@creature behir}, a {@creature hydra}, a {@creature tyrannosaurus rex}, and others, tear through the streets, leaving carnage in their wake.

	"Along the frost-dappled fields of the northern plains, the heart of the Dwendalian Empire is formed by a sprawl of dirt-packed roads, dense forests, and austere townships that fight back the dangerous creatures of the wilderness. Divided from the southern Marrow Valley by the mountains of the Silberquel Ridge, this region is known for its gray skies, fits of cold rain, and occasional snowfall, keeping the feet of the denizens muddy and their crops healthy. The Dunrock Mountains shield the people from the threats that loom beyond the boundaries of the king's rule, with the Rockguard Garrison to the east holding firm against the deadly armies of the Kryn Dynasty and the dangers that brew beyond the Ashkeeper Peaks. Home to the mighty imperial capital of Rexxentrum, these fields are the seat of power and commerce for the empire. Diplomats often find themselves traveling to and from the Zemni Fields, while traders and merchants from around the world traverse the long roads in hopes of making their fortunes in the capital city. Even so, the growing ferocity from beasts and creatures that share this region mingle with the whispers of a recovering criminal element and the escalating war with the Kryn to create a perpetual air of tension and anxiety.": "沿着北部平原布满冰霜的田野，德文达尔帝国的中心由一连串的土路、茂密的森林和朴素的乡镇组成，这些乡镇对抗着荒野上的危险生物。这个地区被西尔伯克尔山脊的山脉与南部的马罗河谷分割开来，以灰色的天空、适合的冷雨和偶尔的降雪而闻名，使居民的双脚保持泥泞，农作物保持健康。敦罗克山为人们抵御国王统治范围以外的威胁，东边的岩石守卫军坚守岗位，抵御克莱恩王朝的致命军队和灰守望者山峰以外的危险。这些地区是强大的帝国首都雷克森特姆的所在地，是帝国的权力和商业所在地。外交官们经常发现自己来往于泽姆尼平原，而来自世界各地的商人们则穿越漫长的道路，希望能在首都发财。即便如此，共享这一地区的野兽和生物越来越凶猛，与正在恢复的犯罪分子的窃窃私语以及与克里恩人不断升级的战争交织在一起，形成了一种长期的紧张和焦虑的空气。",

	"Established in the early years following the Calamity, Druvenlode is the primary source of precious metal in Western Wynandir. Located at the western base of the Silberquel Ridge by the mouth of the largest silver vein ever found on the continent. Dusty from wind-swept mountain dirt that turns to mud in the wetter seasons, Druvenlode is a far cry from beautiful Rexxentrum or any of the pastoral villages of the empire. Though the city is wealthy, buildings here were designed for function and storage while the talented architects focused on the noble homesteads and wards of the capital, leaving Druvenlode seemingly rough and rustic by comparison.": "德鲁文洛德建立于灾变后的最初几年，是西威南迪尔的主要贵金属来源。位于西尔伯克尔山脊的西部基地，在大陆上发现的最大银矿脉的入口处。尘土飞扬的山地泥土在较湿润的季节会变成泥浆，德鲁文洛德与美丽的雷克森特姆或帝国的任何一个田园村落相比相差甚远。虽然这个城市很富裕，但这里的建筑是为功能和储存而设计的，而有才华的建筑师则专注于首都的贵族家园和病房，相比之下，德鲁文洛德显得粗糙而质朴。",
	"Starosta Uvilia Whek oversees all major mining operations, and the larger mining guilds report directly to her. Maintenance of these mines also requires constantly protecting the workers and battling the dangerous creatures of the Silberquel Ridge, creating a thriving market for mercenary work when the Crownsguard are too busy—or too cowardly.

Silverstreet is a long thoroughfare where the talented folk of Druvenlode hawk their wares, advertise their skills, and seek legal ways to earn an income under the watch of the empire. The street is bookended by two massive gambling taverns that vie for dominance: the Sterling Satchel and the Cabin of Fortune.

	"Within the rolling hills of the southern Zemni Fields lies the dwarven city of Pride's Call. Established in the ashes of the Calamity and slowly rebuilt as the center of hill dwarf culture in Wildemount, Pride's Call chose to ally with the Dwendalian Empire during the empire's expansion nearly two centuries ago. Their favor as the empire's first allies eventually waned when the dwarven city of Grimgolir was absorbed a century later, leaving Pride's Call overshadowed by the new, impressive, and strategically significant dwarf city. However, Pride's Call is nonetheless respectable in martial might and historically rich in culture, music, and their coveted pride silk. The city is a bright spot in the otherwise cold and dour northwestern Wynandir.": "在泽姆尼平原南部连绵起伏的丘陵中，坐落着矮人城市 \"骄傲的召唤\"。骄傲的呼唤建立在灾难的灰烬中，并慢慢重建为怀尔德蒙的山地矮人文化中心，在近两个世纪前帝国的扩张中，骄傲的呼唤选择与德温达里安帝国结盟。作为帝国的第一个盟友，他们的优势最终在一个世纪后矮人城市Grimgolir被吞并时减弱了，使得骄傲的召唤被新的、令人印象深刻的、具有战略意义的矮人城市所掩盖。然而，\"骄傲的呼唤 \"在武功上还是值得尊敬的，在文化、音乐和他们梦寐以求的骄傲丝绸方面也有丰富的历史。这座城市是威南迪尔西北部寒冷和沉闷的一个亮点。",
	"During the invasion of the Julous Dominion, the empire saw many great deeds done under the banner of Pride's Call. After helping the empire achieve victory, the people of Pride's Call enjoyed a period of celebratory attention. Their fame subsided, however, as Dwendalian attention turned to the mounting threat of Xhorhasian terrors boldly crossing the Brokenveil. Talks had already been privately underway to bring the dwarven stronghold of Grimgolir under imperial rule, given their military might and advantageous proximity to the brewing danger. With the combination of Grimgolir's power and the empire's plentiful resources, victory was ensured and a strong sentinel force at the Xhorhasian border was established. Grimgolir became the new favored home of the dwarves in Wynandir, and many Pride's Call dwarves who lived through those years still hold a grudge—a fact that the Crown deftly wields to exploit both cities.": "在入侵朱鲁斯统治区的过程中，帝国看到了许多在 \"骄傲的呼唤 \"旗帜下的伟大事迹。在帮助帝国取得胜利后，\"骄傲的呼唤 \"的人们享受了一段值得庆祝的关注。然而，他们的名声渐渐平息了，因为德文达尔人的注意力转向了日益增长的霍哈斯人的威胁，他们大胆地穿越了断壁残垣。鉴于矮人据点格林戈里尔的军事力量和靠近酝酿中的危险的优势，他们已经在私下里进行了谈判，将其纳入帝国的统治之下。随着格林戈里尔的力量和帝国丰富的资源的结合，胜利得到了保证，并在Xhorhasian边境建立了一支强大的哨兵部队。Grimgolir成为维南迪尔的矮人新宠，许多经历过那些年的Pride's Call矮人仍然怀恨在心--王室巧妙地利用了这一事实。",
	"The dwarves of Pride's Call produce a number of useful exports, but none are as unique nor as sought after as pride silk. This remarkable fabric can only be woven from materials found in the unique ecosystem of the geothermically active hills around Pride's Call. A special breed of silkworms has developed in these strange conditions. These fist-sized silkworms produce abnormally thin and incredibly resilient strands, and a secret process of reinforcing the threads creates a material similar in texture and appearance to thick silk, but with the strength of treated leather. Affluent folk across Exandria pay handsomely for garments made of pride silk, but rumors are beginning to spread that outsiders have uncovered the secret, and the tradition might be slipping from the grasp of Pride's Call.": "骄傲的呼唤的矮人生产许多有用的出口产品，但没有一个像骄傲的丝绸那样独特，也没有一个像骄傲的丝绸那样受人欢迎。这种非凡的织物只能由傲慢之声周围地热活跃的山丘的独特生态系统中的材料织成。在这些奇怪的条件下，一种特殊的蚕种已经发展起来。这些拳头大小的蚕生产出异常纤细且极具弹性的丝线，通过一个秘密的过程来强化这些丝线，从而创造出一种在质地和外观上与厚丝相似，但具有处理过的皮革强度的材料。整个艾克桑德里亚的富人都会为骄傲之丝制成的服装支付丰厚的费用，但有传言说外人已经揭开了这个秘密，而这个传统可能会从骄傲之呼的手中溜走。",

Many of his people are loudly voicing their discontent, and younger politicians such as Usula Starsburn are rising in popularity to succeed as starosta when Ghuldi eventually passes away. Fearing that he will have to choose between his legacy and the opinions of younger generations, Ghuldi is beginning to exhibit more totalitarian behaviors, slowly becoming a petulant dictator.": "骄傲的呼唤 \"由与帝国签署最初契约的矮人管理。Starosta Ghuldi Demosk在他的晚年，面对越来越多的侵略性统治，竭尽所能地维护自己的文化。古尔迪是个理想主义者，无法看到自己的判断有任何错误，在许多人看来，他在最顽固的矮人中也是个硬骨头。他的许多人都在大声地表达他们的不满，而像乌苏拉-斯塔伯恩这样年轻的政治家正在崛起，当古尔迪最终离开人世时，他将接任斯塔。由于担心自己将不得不在自己的遗产和年轻一代的意见之间做出选择，古尔迪开始表现出更多的极权行为，慢慢地成为一个娇气的独裁者。",
	"While the city's colorful veneer makes it seem a place of plenty, the economy of Pride's Call has been in slow decline for some time. The landscape's strange mineral composition makes its produce a healthy but unsavory and unpopular export, while other goods that previously brought the city prosperity are now more readily and quickly available from traders on the Menagerie Coast. This economic downturn has led to a rise in crime in the impoverished regions of the city, and also opened the door for bolder Myriad activity.": "虽然这个城市五颜六色的外衣使它看起来是一个富足的地方，但一段时间以来，骄傲的呼唤的经济一直在缓慢下降。景观中奇怪的矿物成分使其产品成为一种健康但不讨人喜欢和不受欢迎的出口产品，而以前给城市带来繁荣的其他商品现在更容易和快速地从Menagerie海岸的商人那里获得。这种经济衰退导致该市贫困地区的犯罪率上升，同时也为更大胆的Myriad活动打开了大门。",

The Crafters contains numerous forges, tanneries, and the well-guarded subterranean silk-production warehouses. Nearest to the mountains is the Vigil borough, where the locally trained Crownsguard mingle with those assigned from Bladegarden to watch over the hillside. The western branch of the Righteous Brand are also stationed in the Vigil borough.

These arcane practitioners and scholars aid the king in engaging foreign interests, in developing magical technology to better oversee the land and enforce his will, and making use of the rare relics that the Crown confiscates from unearthed sites of pre-Calamity might. This arrangement affords the assembly homes in the Candles and across the major cities of the empire, as well as access to every Dwendalian political figure. Thus, members of the assembly are extremely influential and, by the nature of their arrangement, very carefully watched by the king. Most civilians swap rumors of demonic pacts and demigod-level magics at the assembly's disposal, adding to their aura of mystique among the common folk.

Some complain that these conditions are often manipulated on a case-by-case basis to remove competition between similar interests, but cries of corruption within the guilds fall on deaf ears. This has led to a rapid growth of mobile businesses on street corners and shops that move between districts to avoid inspection by Crownsguard or guild members.": "Rexxentrum资源丰富的经济支持着一个强大的公会和商人阶层，他们在公会会长Kai Arness的监督下直接与皇家合作。任何永久性的商业场所都需要加入相应的公会，除了向王室交纳税款外，还要缴纳年费，并遵守公会的经营条件要求。一些人抱怨说，这些条件经常被逐一操纵，以消除类似利益之间的竞争，但对行会内部腐败的呼声却充耳不闻。这导致街头巷尾的流动生意迅速增长，商店在各区之间流动，以避免被皇冠卫士或公会成员检查。",
	"Historically, public displays of unease under the king's rule were often met with brutal punishment. However, the previous king, Everard Dwendal, loosened the laws applying to public discourse. This gave rise to a number of political figures who gathered the unhappy populace behind their philosophies. In response, King Everard established the Augen Trust, a network of spies working for the king to blackmail or corrupt these politicians. With these high-profile dissenters under the thumb of the Crown, controlling political discourse became easier, and politics within the empire became a tense game of cat and mouse. Forthright nobles and frustrated guild heads unswayed by propaganda, gold, or threats still dissent publicly, testing the boundaries of their influence. King Bertrand's patience with public objections to his policies grows ever thinner, and he is enacting even more stringent laws against public criticism of the Crown.": "历史上，在国王的统治下，公开表现出的不安往往会受到残酷的惩罚。然而，前任国王埃弗拉德-德文达尔放宽了适用于公共言论的法律。这就产生了一些政治人物，他们把不高兴的民众聚集在他们的理念后面。作为回应，埃弗拉德国王建立了奥根信托，一个为国王工作的间谍网络，以勒索或腐蚀这些政治家。随着这些高调的持不同意见者受到王室的控制，控制政治话语变得更加容易，帝国内的政治成为一场紧张的猫捉老鼠的游戏。正直的贵族和受挫的行会首脑不为宣传、黄金或威胁所动摇，仍然公开提出异议，测试他们影响力的界限。贝特朗国王对公众反对他的政策的耐心越来越薄，他正在制定更严格的法律来反对公众对王室的批评。",
	"In the wake of frustrated citizens, neglected concerns, and a clear caste system, the common folk of Rexxentrum are disenfranchised. The rallying call of war has brought some renewed imperial pride, but whispers of discontent have continued, coalescing into a small group of rebels within the capital that call themselves the Locksmiths. Wary of the history of failed rebellions in the empire, they gather information and gradually inspire the common folk to question authority, waiting for the right moment to ignite a revolution with a chance of success.

Although they were severed from the direct influence of the Ruiner, the directionless orcs began to succumb to the Ruiner's \"gift\" of bloodlust.

They formed an organized clan of warrior orcs who seek to overcome the Ruiner's murderous influence and find strength within themselves. From this new path, the Boroftkrah orc clan and the settlement of Boroftkrah was born, creating a strong community that values deeds done in service to the clan. The orcs of Boroftkrah wander the surrounding plains in heavy furs and leathers, seeking ways to commune with Kord through challenges of survival and contests of hunting and tracking skill.

Tall dunes glitter like piles of diamonds in the daylight, shifting with high winds and the movements of the remorhazes and frost worms that burrow and hunt beneath the sands. Nomadic clans of northern goblins form hunting parties and ride winter wolves, stalking the furred beasts that call these frosted dunes home. Other beings stay hidden to avoid the giant hawks and giant owls that fly over from the Flotket Alps in search of prey. In times of fresh snowfall, travel is extremely dangerous, since the soft powder obscures the shifting sands and ice-marked tunnels that lead to the gnashing jaws of the subterranean frost worms.

	"Many denizens of the Veluthil were slain following the destruction of Molaesmyr and the spread of the mysterious curse that transformed the wood, but one group of tabaxi from the southern reaches of the forest survived and refused to flee. Knowing that the spirits of their ancestors were bound to the trees, they chose to stay and adapt, learning to live a nomadic life among the perpetual threats of the forest. Devoted to Melora, the Nightback Clan patrols the forest for food and locations to briefly make home. Unpleasant encounters with folk from Shadycreek Run have left some of the Nightback Clan eager to terrorize any unlucky thieves found in the Savalirwood. The Nightback Clan also blames the elves of Molaesmyr for the tragedy that claimed the forest and refuses to speak to or work with any representatives of Uthodurn.": "在Molaesmyr的毁灭和改变森林的神秘诅咒的传播之后，许多Veluthil的居民都被杀了，但有一群来自森林南部的tabaxi幸存下来，并拒绝逃离。他们知道他们祖先的灵魂与树木结合在一起，所以他们选择留下并适应，学习在森林的永久威胁中过着游牧生活。夜叉部族对梅洛拉非常忠诚，他们在森林中巡逻，寻找食物和可以短暂安家的地点。与来自Shadycreek Run的人的不愉快遭遇使一些夜叉族人渴望恐吓在Savalirwood发现的任何不幸的小偷。夜回氏族还将夺走森林的悲剧归咎于莫莱斯米尔的精灵，并拒绝与任何乌索杜恩的代表交谈或合作。",

	"The Nightback Clan captured a merchant caravan traveling through the Savalirwood, suspecting that the travelers are thieves. The characters are hired by the merchant's family to rescue the caravan. If they can track the tabaxi through the woods, they must either convince the Nightback Clan that the travelers are innocent or fight to free the captives. Things grow more complicated when the tabaxi present compelling evidence that this merchant caravan is more than just a group of simple travelers.": "夜行者家族抓获了一个穿越萨瓦里林的商队，怀疑这些旅行者是盗贼。角色们受雇于商人的家人来营救商队。如果他们能在树林中追踪Tabaxi，他们必须说服夜叉家族相信旅行者是无辜的，或者为释放俘虏而战斗。当tabaxi提出令人信服的证据，证明这个商队不仅仅是一群简单的旅行者时，事情变得更加复杂。",
	"While traveling through the forest, the characters encounter a {@creature treant} who insists on guiding them safely through the Savalirwood. The treant claims to know every nook and cranny in the forest, as well as its dangers. On the surface, it seems very helpful. However, the curse afflicting the forest has driven the treant mad and made it delusional. All the dangers it describes are inventions of its twisted mind, and it has a knack for leading the characters into one perilous situation after another.": "在森林中旅行时，人物遇到了一个坚持引导他们安全通过萨瓦里尔森林的{@creature treant}。这个树人声称知道森林中的每一个角落和缝隙，以及它的危险。从表面上看，这似乎很有帮助。然而，困扰森林的诅咒已经把树人逼疯了，使它产生了错觉。它所描述的所有危险都是它扭曲的头脑所发明的，而且它有一个诀窍，就是把人物带入一个又一个危险的境地。",
	"The treant's refusal to divulge its name is the first clue that something is amiss. In truth, the treant no longer remembers its name.": "树人拒绝透露自己的名字，这是第一条线索，说明事情不对劲。事实上，树人已经不记得自己的名字了。",

	"The harsh, unguarded environment breeds a tough people, and despite the ravaging beasts that pick off easy prey from the outskirts, proud groups of hunters and skinners have risen to become prominent traders.

Professions here range from artisans and craftsman to farmers, mercenaries, and entertainers. However, the most profitable entrepreneurs in the region are thieves, hunters, and scavengers who brave the deadly Savalirwood and the ruins of Molaesmyr. Powerful beasts yield hearty meat and furs, while recovered relics and lost magics fetch quite the price in distant markets. The struggle over these prizes often grows bloody, as the Tribes and the Greytrader Union battle to gain control of these trades, while also competing with the people of Uthodurn who wish to reclaim their heritage and lost belongings.": "许多人选择住在沙迪克雷恩，是为了避免帝国内部的迫害（或起诉），而其他一些人则是为了享受一个具有明显道德灵活性的土地所带来的残酷的生活方式。这里的职业包括从工匠和手艺人到农民、雇佣兵和艺人。然而，该地区最有利可图的企业家是盗贼、猎人和拾荒者，他们勇敢地在致命的萨瓦里尔森林和莫拉伊斯米尔的废墟中前进。强大的野兽产生了丰盛的肉和毛皮，而收回的文物和丢失的魔法在遥远的市场上卖出了相当高的价格。争夺这些奖品的斗争往往变得血腥，因为部落和灰衣商人联盟为获得这些贸易的控制权而争斗，同时也与希望夺回自己的遗产和丢失的物品的乌索敦人竞争。",

The members of the union don't abide imperial rule, and they enjoy the freedom of a lawless lifestyle, but they also wish to be free of the legacy of violence for which Shadycreek Run is known. Made up of trappers, hunters, builders, and craftsmen from all walks of life, the Greytrader Union wishes to institute self-appointed marshals to keep the peace. They aim to increase the safety of civilians, turn the Run into a respectable destination for trade, and eventually diminish the influence of the Tribes and the Grudge Gang.": "灰衣商人联盟是一个由改过自新的弃儿和罪犯组成的派别，他们希望与外部社会建立稳固的贸易关系，并通过使其成为一个更安全、更实用的社区来帮助挽救沙迪克雷恩。联盟的成员不遵守帝国的统治，他们享受无法无天的生活方式的自由，但他们也希望摆脱沙迪克雷克流传下来的暴力。由来自各行各业的捕猎者、猎人、建筑商和工匠组成的灰衣人联盟希望设立自我任命的元帅来维持和平。他们的目标是提高平民的安全，将沙迪克河变成一个值得尊敬的贸易目的地，并最终削弱部落和怨恨帮的影响。",
	"The Tribes are a collective of rival criminal families who ran the Run for nearly a century before they lost much of their dominance to violent infighting and internal power struggles. Comprised of the Mardoon, Uttolot, Trebain, and Jagentoth families, the Tribes work to maintain control over most of the business that transpires in the city, and conspire against each other in secret. While each family center is usually composed of relatives by blood or marriage, their employees are also considered \"within the family,\" so long as they remain loyal.

Members of the gang will happily work for the Greytrader Union or any of the families of the Tribes, so long as their business isn't bloody enough to harm innocents or put the safety of the Run at stake. Since the other factions rely on the Grudge Gang for protection from the terrors of the Savalirwood, its members consider themselves neutral instruments in the political chess game. Some members of the gang have assigned themselves to maintain order in a land without law, calling themselves Taskers and doing their best to keep the innocent from being crushed by the city's predators. Their priorities revolve around lending their skills to whoever pays the best, maintaining livable streets, and keeping the dangers of the Savalirwood and the Dwendalian Empire out of the city.": "怨恨帮是一个由雇佣兵组成的坚韧不拔的公司，他们在润州境内充当着执行地方利益的力量。他们由德文达尔军队的一群逃兵建立，已经发展成为一个忠于硬币和彼此的战士营。该帮派的成员很乐意为灰商联盟或任何一个部落的家族工作，只要他们的业务没有血腥到伤害无辜者或将润州的安全置于危险之中。由于其他派别依靠怨灵帮来保护他们不受萨瓦里林的威胁，其成员认为自己是政治棋局中的中立工具。该帮派的一些成员被指派在没有法律的土地上维持秩序，他们称自己为任务者，并尽力防止无辜者被城市的掠夺者压垮。他们的首要任务是把他们的技能借给谁，谁就能得到最好的报酬，维持宜居的街道，并把萨瓦里林和德文达里亚帝国的危险挡在城市之外。",
	"The city has no central government or laws, so much of it is held together by a vague sense of \"live and let live,\" broken by occasional bursts of \"take what I want.\" If violence spirals out of control, the Grudge Gang's Taskers step in and beat everyone involved to a pulp. It's not uncommon for careless folk to wind up dead in a snow-covered alley, stripped of their goods and left to be eaten by starving dogs.

	"What began as an extended string of shanties and shacks built along the southern treeline of the Savalirwood has turned into a three-mile-long, crooked main street called Clover Alley, lined with hovels, buildings, and mudholes. The neighborhoods on the southern side of the Alley, called the South Clover, are the most impoverished and least maintained areas of the city, known for extremely desperate folk and even more dangerous business.

	"The small town of Uraliss was Uthodurn's first attempt to expand beyond its mountain halls. Uraliss was settled with the intent of becoming a farming village to aid in crop production. As the town began construction, arcane wards were developed and placed along a patch of snow-covered field at the base of the Flotket Alps. The wards were designed to slowly melt the snow and hopefully help develop the area into farmable land. However, the town was beset by orcs and other threats from the Rime Plains, and the town's hopes were further crushed when the land beneath the snow was found to be rocky and untillable. The settlement was quickly abandoned and is now a crumbling ghost town left to be vandalized and repurposed by the Boroftkrah orcs of the Rime Plains.": "小镇Uraliss是乌索杜恩第一次尝试向山地大厅以外的地方扩张。乌拉里斯定居的目的是成为一个农业村落，以帮助农作物生产。随着城镇建设的开始，奥术防护装置被开发出来，并沿着弗洛特克特阿尔卑斯山脚下的一片白雪覆盖的田地放置。这些魔法阵被设计用来慢慢融化积雪，希望能帮助该地区发展成为可耕地。然而，该镇被兽人和其他来自莱姆平原的威胁所困扰，当发现雪下的土地是岩石和不可耕种的时候，该镇的希望被进一步粉碎了。这个定居点很快就被放弃了，现在成了一个摇摇欲坠的鬼城，任由里姆平原的博洛夫克拉兽人破坏和重新利用。",

	"Hidden among the icy peaks of the Flotket Alps, the northernmost dwarven stronghold of Wildemount is ensconced in the base of a steep mountain valley. Uthodurn is a bastion of dwarven culture, home to a secluded people who've endured the freezing temperatures and continuous snowfall across the mountains and surrounding lands since they founded the stronghold nearly eight hundred years ago. The dwarves of Uthodurn are sharp of wit, hairier than their southern brethren, and as unyielding as the rock they live in. The Queen of Uthodurn broke from stubborn dwarven traditions and opened the city's doors to thousands of elven refugees following the destruction of Molaesmyr nearly three centuries ago. While there have been moments of conflict between the dwarves and elves as ancient grudges are briefly revived, the society within these fire-warmed stone halls has grown into a unique union of both cultures.": "隐藏在弗洛特阿尔卑斯山冰冷的山峰中，最北端的矮人据点怀德蒙（Wildemount）坐落在一个陡峭的山沟底部。乌索德恩是矮人文化的堡垒，是一个隐居的民族的家，自从他们在近八百年前建立据点以来，一直忍受着整个山区和周围土地的冰冷温度和持续降雪。乌索杜恩的矮人机智敏锐，比南方的兄弟们更多毛，而且像他们居住的岩石一样不屈不挠。Uthodurn的女王打破了顽固的矮人传统，在近三个世纪前Molaesmyr的毁灭之后，向成千上万的精灵难民敞开了城市的大门。虽然矮人和精灵之间也曾有过冲突，因为古老的怨恨被短暂地唤醒，但在这些火热的石头大厅里的社会已经发展成为两种文化的独特结合。",

The people of Uthodurn hunt and track in bursts, like sudden flurries of snow, stalking the wild white bison and cliffneck goats that call the Flotket Alps home. The dwarves and elves of Uthodurn have adapted to their environment, becoming skilled hunters and trackers as well as hearty travelers used to persisting through extreme conditions. As the hunter's saying goes, \"squeezing water from a stone might be hard, but snaring a rabbit from the Flots is harder.\" A strong martial force is necessary to combat dangers such as frost giant clans and snow-faring goblinoid bands that hunt throughout the slopes and caverns of the mountain range, and the masters of Uthodurn have trained fierce warriors and spellslingers.": "在城市的铁门之外，地下堡垒周围的荒野是残酷的寒冷和被切割的风所打击的。Uthodurn的人们在一阵阵的狩猎和追踪中，就像突如其来的雪花一样，跟踪着把Flotket阿尔卑斯山当作家的野生白野牛和崖颈山羊。乌索杜恩的矮人和精灵已经适应了他们的环境，成为熟练的猎人和追踪者，以及习惯于在极端条件下坚持的酣畅淋漓的旅行者。正如猎人所说，\"从石头中挤出水可能很难，但从弗洛特人手中抢到一只兔子更难\"。一支强大的军事力量是对抗危险的必要条件，如冰霜巨人部族和在整个山脉的斜坡和洞穴中狩猎的雪地妖精群，乌索杜恩的主人已经训练出凶猛的战士和法术师。",
	"Uthodurn has the unique distinction of being the only place in Wildemount where dwarven and elven lifestyles and traditions come together within one location. The resulting collaborations have created incredible new crafts and means of circumventing the challenges of the region. Dwarven carving techniques blend with elven arcane knowledge to elevate architecture and excavation capabilities.

	"Dwarves and elves have lived together under the same roof and banner for centuries within Uthodurn. Over those years, they have forged ties of mutual respect, and romances and unions between elves and dwarves have also become increasingly common as the years progress. Though such partnerships were initially considered scandalous, they came to be met with tolerance, and eventually celebration. While an elf and dwarf may indeed produce offspring, the curiously stubborn nature of both ancestries produces a child that is either an elf or a dwarf, though a child of either race often inherits minor physical attributes from the other parent. Such children are affectionately referred to as attalwen, or \"two-hearted.\"": "矮人和精灵在Uthodurn的同一屋檐下和旗帜下共同生活了几个世纪。在这些年里，他们建立了相互尊重的关系，随着时间的推移，精灵和矮人之间的浪漫和结合也变得越来越普遍。虽然这种伙伴关系最初被认为是丑闻，但他们开始受到宽容，并最终得到了庆祝。虽然精灵和矮人确实可以产生后代，但由于这两个种族的祖先都具有奇怪的顽固性，因此产生的孩子要么是精灵，要么是矮人，不过这两个种族的孩子往往会从另一个父母那里继承小的身体属性。这样的孩子被亲切地称为attalwen，或 \"双心\"。",

The city provides free transportation to and from Syrinlya, in addition to rewarding discoveries, because they are desperate for items that could provide them with more resources, guard them from an invasion from the Dwendalian Empire or the Kryn Dynasty, or help cure the corruption in the Savalirwood. A handful of scholars believe the source of the Savalirwood's corruption might even be tied to something within the ruins of Aeor.": "Uthodurn政体奖励那些在Foren荒原发现魔法物品的人，促使Uthodurn最有经验的--也是最绝望的--探险家前往Syrinlya。Uthodurn没有资金来支持在Foren的全面探险，所以他们为收集此类物品的公民提供奖励。该城市除了奖励发现的物品外，还提供来往于Syrinlya的免费交通，因为他们急于寻找可以为他们提供更多资源的物品，保卫他们免受来自Dwendalian帝国或Kryn王朝的入侵，或帮助治疗Savalirwood的腐败。少数学者认为Savalirwood的腐败之源甚至可能与Aeor废墟中的某些东西有关。",

Many construction businesses have small building yards here, while the upper, or Topper, mines work hard to pull iron from the surrounding rock. The main Glassblade barracks are centered around the entrance tunnels that descend into the city.": "螺旋形的顶层被称为 \"意志之盘\"，是最宽阔和最古老的区域。许多市民居住在Volition Disc的外墙上，这里是一个独特的、有棱有角的石头房子和高大的精灵家园的混杂体。该区被一条名为奥格小径的中央道路一分为二，它既是一条大道，也是一个论坛，两旁摆放着桌子、长椅和小贩的小车。许多建筑企业在这里有小的建筑院子，而上面的矿场，即托普矿场，则在努力从周围的岩石中提取铁。主要的玻璃刀兵营围绕着下降到城市的入口隧道。",

If they have disputes with one another, they reconcile or simply go separate ways.

	"While pieces of Aeor were thrown all over Eiselcross and the Frigid Depths, the city's main crash initially created a three-mile-diameter crater in the center of Foren.

The buried ruins are filled with dangerous, wonderful creations and pockets of people frozen in time.": "虽然流星的碎片被扔到了Eiselcross和Frigid Depths的各处，但城市的主要碰撞最初在Foren的中心创造了一个直径三英里的火山口。在此后的几个世纪里，冰雪覆盖了这个火山口。遗迹从冰霜的表面探出，形成了隧道、坑洞和裂缝。埋在地下的废墟中充满了危险的、奇妙的创造物和被冻结在时间中的人的口袋。",
	"Most of Aeor's streets, buildings, and people were smashed to pieces when the city collided with Foren. Amid the ruins are magic fields of translucent blue force surrounding moments frozen in time. Many of these bubbles hold diverse crowds of humanoids huddled in the street, their bodies, clothes, belongings, and the ground itself unharmed by the crash. Others contain families holding hands as they brace for impact around dining tables, mages waving wands in the air around laboratory benches, soldiers with glowing swords raised to the sky, siege crews climbing atop weapons meant to fire massive projectiles, and more. Each magic field is a 10-foot-radius sphere, and nothing within appears damaged or moved by the crash.": "当Aeor与Foren相撞时，大部分街道、建筑和人们都被砸成了碎片。在废墟中，有半透明的蓝色力量的魔力场，围绕着时间冻结的时刻。这些气泡中的许多都是蜷缩在街道上的各种人群，他们的身体、衣服、财物和地面本身都没有受到撞击的伤害。其他的泡泡里有一家人手拉手在餐桌旁准备迎接撞击，法师们在实验室的长椅旁向空中挥舞着魔杖，士兵们举着发光的剑指向天空，攻城队员们爬在旨在发射巨大射弹的武器上，等等。每个魔法场都是一个半径为10英尺的球体，里面的任何东西都不会因为撞击而损坏或移动。",
	"While these preserved scenes are sometimes useful for gathering information, the items and people within are the real prize. Totally intact Aeorian technology is a rare find, but having even one of Aeor's inventors or mages to demonstrate, repair, and rebuild their creations is a reward beyond any of the other treasures the ruins hold. However, all attempts to dispel, break, or otherwise remove the impenetrable magic barriers have failed. The people within appear frozen in time, but no evidence suggests this stasis would change if the barriers dropped, or that the change would be for the better. Some say the barriers dropping could cause the creatures within to age rapidly, turn to dust, or go mad. Despite these warnings, explorers search Aeor's ruins for an item or spell that can break these bubbles.": "虽然这些保存下来的场景有时对收集信息很有用，但里面的物品和人是真正的奖品。完全完好的Aeorian技术是一个罕见的发现，但即使是Aeor的发明家或法师中的一个来展示、修复和重建他们的创造，也是一个超越废墟中任何其他宝藏的奖励。然而，所有试图驱散、打破或以其他方式消除坚不可摧的魔法屏障的努力都失败了。里面的人似乎被冻结在了时间里，但没有证据表明如果障碍物掉落，这种停滞状态会改变，或者说这种改变会是更好的。有些人说，障碍物掉落会导致里面的生物迅速老化，变成灰尘，或者发疯。尽管有这些警告，探险家们还是在Aeor的废墟上寻找能够打破这些气泡的物品或咒语。",

This disease was created to slow down the forces of the gods and get around the healing power of their clerics and angels.": "冰冷的哀伤是由Aeor的法师们开发的一种特殊疾病，无法通过常规的治疗或魔法来治愈。感染这种疾病的生物能够被治愈的唯一方法是找到并喝下制造的解毒剂，一种储存在艾瑟克罗斯废墟的金瓶中的乳白色液体。创造这种疾病是为了减缓诸神的力量，并绕过他们的神职人员和天使的治疗能力。",

In the center of this cave stands a fifteen-foot-tall obelisk made of dark, reflective metal that resembles smoothed obsidian. The stone quietly hums with an aura of abjuration from some mysterious enchantment. Travelers that complete a long rest within proximity of the stone are visited with terrible dreams of strange, alien places and visions difficult to understand.": "在确定坠机地点的火山口以西一英里处，有一座岩石山，可以解冻上面的任何雪或冰。在山丘的北侧可以找到一个洞穴的入口，它通向一个60英尺宽的圆顶室。在这个洞穴的中心，矗立着一个15英尺高的方尖碑，由黑暗、反光的金属制成，类似于光滑的黑曜石。这块石头静静地哼唱着某种神秘的咒语带来的禁忌之气。在这块石头附近完成长期休息的旅行者会做一些可怕的梦，梦见奇怪的异地和难以理解的幻觉。",

These beings are trapped inside the castle along with a hoard of Aeorian items.": "从外面看，死亡伯爵堡垒是一个完全由冰构成的巨大童话城堡。这个地方内部的恐怖讲述了一个不同的故事。冰霜巨人的领袖康妮莎-伯格（Jarl Conessa Berg）痴迷于收集来自Aeor的物品。两个世纪前，其中一件物品将科妮莎和她城堡里的每个巨人变成了不死的僵尸。这些生物和大量的Aeorian物品一起被困在城堡里。",

This breach could be natural or could be caused by a faction with a score to settle against the attacked outpost.": "当人物到达Balenpost或Syrinlya时，一个{@creature frost giant zombie|EGW}（见{@book chapter 7|EGW|8|Frost Giant Zombie}）攻击营地。如果角色帮助打败了巨人，营地的领导者会告诉角色这是几天内的第三次攻击，并要求他们找到僵尸的来源。角色可以追踪僵尸回到堡垒。角色们每天沿着这条道路前进，滚动任何模具。如果结果是偶数，角色会遇到{@dice 1d4}冰霜巨人僵尸。当他们到达要塞时，他们发现其中一面墙被攻破了，必须修复它以阻止僵尸离开城堡。这个缺口可能是自然形成的，也可能是某一派系对被攻击的前哨站有意见而造成的。",
	"In the northern part of Foren, a strange patch of wilderness exactly 30 miles in diameter is avoided by the wildfolk at all costs. They call this region Mutalos. Every morning at dawn, the area's environment suddenly changes. Mutalos shifts from desert to forest, from mountainous to swamp, or from any one habitat to another without any discernible pattern. The area can even be a seemingly normal icy tundra, so unsuspecting explorers traveling through Mutalos could suddenly find themselves in the middle of the sea when the sun rises.": "在Foren的北部，有一片奇怪的荒野，直径正好30英里，野人不惜一切代价也要避开。他们称这个地区为穆塔罗斯。每天清晨，该地区的环境会突然改变。Mutalos从沙漠转变为森林，从山地转变为沼泽，或者从任何一个栖息地转变为另一个栖息地，没有任何可识别的模式。该地区甚至可以是一个看似正常的冰雪苔原，所以毫无戒心的探险者在Mutalos旅行时，可能会突然发现自己在太阳升起时处于大海之中。",

It is unknown where exactly these creatures come from and where they go when the regions change. They could be transported from other places in Exandria, teleported from elsewhere in the multiverse, or created and destroyed by this strange magic. It is also unknown if the same creatures reappear with the same habitats or if the creatures are always new to Mutalos. The origin of the region's changes likely holds the answers to these questions.": "当Mutalos的环境发生变化时，它的居民也会发生变化。在黎明时分，充满哥布林、山羊和食人魔的山区可能会变成蜥蜴人、老鼠和元宝居住的沼泽地。不知道这些生物究竟来自哪里，当地区发生变化时它们会去哪里。它们可能是从埃克桑德里亚的其他地方运来的，也可能是从多元宇宙的其他地方传送过来的，或者是由这种奇怪的魔法创造和摧毁的。同样的生物是否以相同的栖息地重新出现，或者这些生物是否一直是穆塔罗斯的新成员，这也是未知数。该地区变化的起源可能掌握着这些问题的答案。",
	"Sometimes a creature that appears in Mutalos leaves the borders of the region. When this occurs, the creature becomes untethered from the magic that brought it to Foren and remains in Eiselcross even after Mutalos's environment changes. Many creatures from other habitats don't last for long in the arctic wastes, but a few are smart or strong enough to survive.": "有时，出现在穆塔罗斯的生物会离开该地区的边界。当这种情况发生时，该生物就会脱离将其带到福尔恩的魔法，即使在穆塔罗斯的环境发生变化后，仍然留在艾瑟克罗斯。许多来自其他栖息地的生物在北极荒原上坚持不了多久，但也有少数生物足够聪明或强大，能够生存下来。",

Wide swaths of military tents cover the western outskirts of the city as countless soldiers prepare for the coming conflicts in the west, training atop the terrifying war beasts and towering war machines brought from Rosohna or built alongside the towering walls of Asarius.": "虽然很多人认为阿萨留斯的建立纯粹是克莱恩王朝的利他主义，但不能否认该城在荒原中的中心位置和靠近帝国边境的战略地位的重要性。光明女王把这个小城镇变成了王朝的一个巨大的军事中心，征召了成千上万的废人组成常备军的骨干力量。大片的军用帐篷覆盖了城市的西部郊区，无数的士兵为即将到来的西部冲突做准备，他们在从罗索纳带来的可怕的战兽和高大的战争机器上训练，或者在阿萨留斯高大的城墙边上训练。",
	"The rule of law is tenuously imposed throughout the chaotic city, where the squabbles of argumentative civilians often lead to physical conflict. The laws of the dynasty, which stem from the faith of the Luxon, are enforced by a network of trusted Aurora Watch captains and soldiers who report to Den Olios within the Aurora Hold. Local affairs are the jurisdiction of Lady Zethriss Olios, who works with representatives of each major neighborhood to manage the city and its people.": "在这个混乱的城市里，法治被勉强强加，争论不休的平民的争吵常常导致肢体冲突。王朝的法律源于卢克松人的信仰，由受信任的极光守望队长和士兵组成的网络来执行，他们在极光城内向丹-奥里奥斯报告。地方事务由泽特里斯-奥里欧斯女士管辖，她与各主要街区的代表合作，管理城市和人民。",

Even so, disagreements can escalate to a point where theft, brutality, and murder sometimes occur with worrying regularity.": "在阿萨留斯，鲜血经常流淌，这里的人们经常发生冲突，只是为了应对平原上的生活压力和挫折。克林人知道这一点；因此，他们关于人身攻击和打架的法律在这个城市比克林领土上的其他地方要宽松得多。即便如此，分歧也会升级到盗窃、暴行和谋杀的地步，有时还会发生令人担忧的情况。",

The hill is surrounded by fifteen-foot-tall walls of purple vermaloc wood, harvested from the eponymous Vermaloc Wildwood. The interior of the city is a tangled mass of wayward, mud-slick streets and a hodgepodge of homes and structures that architecturally mirror the social mixture of dark elf society and the many nomadic lifestyles of the wastefolk. The center of the city is marked by the ominous spire known as the Aurora Hold, home to Den Olios.": "这座粗犷、喧闹的城市的大部分地区都分布在一座宽阔、泥泞的山上，可以俯瞰周围的平原。山丘被15英尺高的紫色维摩罗木墙包围着，维摩罗木是从同名的维摩罗野林中采伐的。城市的内部是一片纠结的、充满泥泞的街道，以及大杂烩式的房屋和建筑，从建筑学上反映了黑暗精灵社会的混合体和废物族的许多游牧生活方式。城市的中心是被称为极光之城的不祥的尖塔，是丹-奥里欧斯的家。",
	"The southeast region of Asarius is called the Pits, named for the multitude of breeding pits for war beasts and other beasts of burden. The Pits are responsible for the city's ever-present smell of wet animals and dung, and the area is also home to many poorer citizens seeking work wherever it can be found. The southwest portion of the city is known as the Creets, a rustic tangle of goblinoid neighborhoods and houses of farming folk who till the harsh environment beyond the eastern walls. The entire northern side of the city is simply known as the Northroads. Within this area, the Scowl Square is the center of commerce, and the North Center forms the industrial core of Asarius.

A community began to flourish within the ruins of Bazzoxan over a few generations, building the foundations of a new city around the looming stone structures of the abandoned sanctum—until demonic forces from within the old temple threw the burgeoning society into chaos.

	"About forty years ago, a group of curious local dungeoneers uncovered a long-dormant gateway to the Abyss. Its demonic influence drove them mad, and they accidentally reactivated the gateway of Bazzoxan—an immense rift between the Abyss and Exandria. This enabled demonic forces to pour out into the ruins and surrounding city. The incursion was eventually stifled, though at a great loss of life.

	"Those who serve the Spider Queen in Xhorhas often pass through Dumaran, and heroes who seek to end her poisonous influence might attempt to destroy the stronghold.": "那些在Xhorhas为蜘蛛女王服务的人经常会经过杜马兰，而那些寻求结束她的毒害影响的英雄可能会试图摧毁这个据点。",

	"Fevergulf Lake is a massive body of brackish water known for its warm temperature and sulfurous smell. Depending on the season, the waters can become almost scalding in places, causing many of the fish and other creatures that live beneath the surface to migrate from one end of the lake to the other. The banks of the lake collect layers of strange minerals and stones of all colors, creating a rainbow of odd pastel hues among the pebbles, sands, and muck on the lake shore. The immensity of the lake gives plenty of room for all manner of strange terrors to thrive beneath the waters, making it extremely dangerous to cross via boat.": "费弗格夫湖是一个巨大的咸水体，以其温暖的温度和硫磺味而闻名。根据季节的不同，湖水在某些地方会变得几乎滚烫，导致许多生活在水面下的鱼类和其他生物从湖的一端迁移到另一端。湖岸收集了各种颜色的奇怪矿物和石头层，在湖岸的鹅卵石、沙子和淤泥中形成了奇怪的粉色彩虹。巨大的湖面给了各种奇怪的恐怖在水底滋生的充足空间，使得乘船过湖极为危险。",

	"The Iothia Moorland fills much of the central valley of Xhorhas, a landscape of hilly grasslands and muddy fields that stretches from horizon to horizon, framed by soggy swamps and massive lakes.

	"All who belong to the clan take a blood oath called the Marking as a teenager (or on being accepted into the clan, if they joined later in life). This vow demands celibacy until an appointed mate is chosen by the Skyspear.

They prefer fearmongering to diplomacy, and most interactions with the Koshtask end in violence, unless a greater enemy is present against whom they must ally.

	"From these talks, the coastal city of Jigow rose to become an important source of seafood within the dynasty. A booming fishing society that spreads over both the banks of the Emerald Gulch Sea and the northern Ifolon River, this community of powerful hunters, cunning fishers, and tireless crafters has become a valuable symbol of the dynasty's growth and influence.": "从这些会谈中，沿海城市Jigow崛起，成为王朝内重要的海产来源。这是一个繁荣的渔业社会，分布在翡翠沟海的两岸和伊福隆河的北部，这个由强大的猎人、狡猾的渔民和不知疲倦的手工业者组成的社区已经成为王朝成长和影响的宝贵象征。",
	"Despite the peace between the peoples of Jigow, their long-standing rivalries require other outlets wherein they can express their need to conquer and gloat, which is why Jigow celebrates competition in any form.

	"The beliefs and superstitions of the original Gakthash, Uvuroh, and Zetek goblin clans permeate Jigow's goblin society. Similarly, the honorable traditions of the Norgab and Shoomat orcs continue to guide their people. While some have adopted the beliefs of the Kryn, many resist the teachings of the drow, as they feel that the presence of drow is suffocating their own culture.

	"Taskhand Durth Mirimm represents the dynasty's interests first and foremost, putting the needs of Jigow's residents a distant second. His controversial judgments are often challenged by the most vocal of the clan elders: Elder Cubu-Ka, an elderly goblin who enjoys frustrating the Kryn representatives, and Elder Ushru, an aging orc hunter eager to maintain the cultural heritage of his people. To the dynasty, maintaining order resembles a handful of adults failing to keep unruly children under control. The native people of Jigow, however, see their willfulness as a way to establish boundaries against a clueless enforcer.": "Taskhand Durth Mirimm首先代表王朝的利益，把吉哥居民的需求放在第二位。他有争议的判断经常受到部族长老中最有发言权的人的挑战。长老Cubu-Ka，一个喜欢挫败克里恩代表的老年地精，以及长老Ushru，一个渴望保持其民族文化遗产的年老兽人猎人。对王朝来说，维持秩序就像少数成年人未能控制住不守规矩的孩子一样。然而，吉高的本地人把他们的任性看作是一种建立边界的方式，以对抗一个无知的执行者。",

	"Jigow is more of a collection of coastal villages than a singular, central city. The settlement is comprised of a chain of settlements clustered among the trees of the shoreline. The main docks, known as the Meatwaters, lie on the westernmost shore, where the fishing industry thrives due to the healthy marine ecosystem. The central villages, called the Jumble, sit slightly farther from the coast, built among the massive mangrove trees and nomadic horizonback tortoises that serve as roving homesteads. The eastern edges, known as the Wetwalks, are filled with huts and shacks built on stilts over the low wetland patches where grains are cultivated in the paddies amid the reeds.": "吉高更像是一个沿海村庄的集合，而不是一个单一的中心城市。该定居点是由一连串的定居点组成的，它们聚集在海岸线的树木之间。主要的码头被称为Meatwaters，位于最西边的海岸上，由于健康的海洋生态系统，这里的渔业非常兴旺。中央的村庄被称为Jumble，离海岸线稍远，建在巨大的红树林和游牧的horizonback龟之间，作为流浪的家园。东部边缘被称为 \"Wetwalks\"，到处都是建在低矮湿地上的木屋和棚屋，在芦苇丛中的水田里种植谷物。",

	"Giant predators and dire monstrosities stalk the undergrowth, while vicious, carnivorous plants patiently await their next meal. Cold nights bring icy mists to the wood, drawing the spirits of those claimed by the Lotusden out into the moonlight to siphon the warmth from the living.

	"No one knows the source of the wild curses that plague the Lotusden, but there are a number of stories that speak of whole portions of the forest suddenly coming to life. The trees uproot themselves and march as one, going berserk and assaulting any they perceive as outsiders—until mysteriously, and without warning, they take root again and return to their docile, unmoving state. While academics maintain that there is no definitive proof of this behavior, some explorers have noticed the shape of the forest's edges changing dramatically, sometimes overnight.": "没有人知道困扰莲花登的野性诅咒的来源，但有许多故事说整个森林的一部分突然变得有生命力。树木拔地而起，团结一致，疯狂地攻击它们认为是外来者的人--直到神秘地、没有警告地，它们再次扎根，回到温顺的、不动的状态。虽然学者们坚持认为没有关于这种行为的确切证据，但一些探险家已经注意到森林边缘的形状发生了巨大变化，有时是一夜之间。",
	"The characters might enter the forest to retrieve someone who is lost or to escape Kryn forces in pursuit. Any plant in Lotusden Greenwood could be a carnivorous monster waiting to attack.": "角色们可能会进入森林去找回迷路的人，或者躲避追捕的克莱恩部队。莲花登绿林中的任何植物都可能是等待攻击的食肉怪物。",

	"South of the Sorrowseep Waters, where the fields are more fertile, lies a scattered network of seven villages with robust communities of goblinkin, orcs, and giants, known as the Many Hosts of Igrathad.

	"While the villages of Igrathad have enjoyed the fruits of a somewhat collaborative society under the guidance of the dynasty, the centuries of turmoil have not been forgotten. Neighbors argue over territory, and youths challenge each other for social dominance. The people take pride in the unique history of their own village, and that pride can win out over the dynasty's message of unity. Interactions between the villages often grow tense when the Kryn aren't around to keep the peace. This isn't helped by the fact that a record number of able-bodied villagers from Igrathad have been sent north to fight on the front lines of the war. The center of the Kryn's government is far away from Igrathad, and many of the Dens are concerned that the tenuous union between the Many Hosts is crumbling.": "虽然伊格拉萨德的村庄在王朝的指导下享受到了某种程度上的合作社会的成果，但几个世纪的动荡并没有被遗忘。邻居们为领土争论不休，年轻人为争夺社会主导权而相互挑战。人们对自己村庄的独特历史感到自豪，而这种自豪感可能会胜过王朝的团结信息。当克莱恩人不在身边维持和平时，村庄之间的互动往往变得紧张。Igrathad的健壮村民被派往北方的战争前线作战，这一事实对此毫无帮助。Kryn的政府中心远离Igrathad，许多Dens都担心Many Hosts之间脆弱的联盟正在崩溃。",

Each leader is assigned a representative from Rosohna to help enforce the will of the Bright Queen, though the leaders often disagree with various facets of the dynasty's decrees, making total unity challenging. The various leaders meet in a public space to make most major decisions and judgments: they debate and sometimes duel to resolve the matters before them. While this unconventional court is not consistent with the dynasty's intended order, few of the Kryn representatives find the will to argue.": "七个村庄中的每一个都有自己的领袖，他们通常因其血统或实力的竞争而被选中。每个领导人都被指派一名来自罗索纳的代表，以帮助执行光明女王的意志，尽管领导人经常不同意王朝法令的各个层面，使完全的统一具有挑战性。各个领导人在一个公共空间开会，作出大多数重大决定和判断：他们辩论，有时还决斗，以解决他们面前的问题。虽然这种非常规的法庭不符合王朝预定的秩序，但克里恩的代表中很少有人找到争论的意愿。",
	"Some Aurora Watch soldiers keep the peace and manage the day-to-day quarrels within Igrathad. However, the majority of the Hosts' people are expertly trained warriors, so they both handle their own problems and make it difficult to enforce any laws on them.

Agents of the Children of Malice are sown like seeds of chaos throughout the city.": "这里的大部分寺庙都是供奉卢克逊的，但在外围地区散布着供奉万神殿其他成员的小神庙。商人行会由Dens组织，与卢克逊的信仰紧密相连。恶意之子的代理人像混乱的种子一样播撒在整个城市。",
	"The realm of Xhorhas was home to the strongholds of the Betrayer Gods as they walked the realm of mortals, but the beating heart of their mercurial alliance was the dark city of Ghor Dranas (meaning \"gathering of shadows\" in Draconic). A monument to the union of tyranny and chaos, the shaded skies framed the dozens of crooked towers and war barracks that surrounded the central citadel of Virkwzual, or \"Dark Bastion\" in the Infernal language. The final battles of the Calamity were waged around Ghor Dranas, and much of the city was reduced to ash and dust. Towers crumbled, the ground opened to swallow the legions of the Betrayers, and the citadel was left sundered and abandoned. It wasn't until the surviving Kryn drow emerged from the Underdark that the city rose from its ashes.": "Xhorhas王国是背叛者诸神在凡人领域行走时的据点，但他们的水银联盟的跳动心脏是黑暗的Ghor Dranas城市（在德拉康语中意为 \"阴影的聚集\"）。作为暴政和混乱结合的纪念碑，阴暗的天空衬托着几十座弯曲的塔楼和军营，它们围绕着维尔克祖尔（Virkwzual）的中心堡垒，在炎黄语中是 \"黑暗堡垒\"。灾难的最后一战是在戈尔-德拉纳斯周围展开的，城市的大部分都化为灰烬和尘埃。塔楼坍塌了，地面开裂，吞没了背叛者的军团，城堡被分割和遗弃了。直到幸存的克里恩鸦人从暗黑世界中出现，这座城市才从灰烬中崛起。",
	"The Kryn slowly cleared the ruins of the corrupt creatures that had claimed it for so long. They built new structures on the foundations of the ancient city while expanding the underground levels beneath, bringing new life to the city of Ghor Dranas, which they named Rosohna, or \"Rebirth,\" in their tongue.": "克林人慢慢地清理了废墟上那些长期以来占据它的腐败的生物。他们在古城的地基上建造了新的建筑，同时扩大了下面的地下楼层，为戈尔-德拉纳斯城带来了新的生命，他们将其命名为Rosohna，用他们的语言来说就是 \"重生\"。",
	"Rosohna is the center of the powerful Kryn society, a symbol of dark history reclaimed. Its tall, dusky spires and beautiful buildings rise from the broken shards of the Calamity. Breaks in the constant cloud cover offer glimpses of sunlight, which is seen as a holy gift shining on the many monuments to the Luxon. Crystalline halls of glass and quartz glow with interior light in the traditional Kryn hues of green and purple.": "罗索纳是强大的克里恩社会的中心，是黑暗历史重现的象征。它高大、昏暗的尖顶和美丽的建筑从灾难的破碎碎片中升起。持续不断的云层中的断裂提供了一丝阳光，这被视为神圣的礼物，照耀着卢克逊的许多纪念碑。玻璃和石英组成的结晶大厅在室内发出绿色和紫色的传统克里恩色调的光芒。",
	"The streets are lively with city-dwelling wastefolk, the Luxon-worshiping drow who live beneath the open sky to spite Lolth's design, and even a few duergar and other beings from the Underdark. Local businesses thrive as the Xhorhasian community grows, and goblinoid merchants have found profit and comfort within this dark elf civilization. Even so, most people beyond the borders of Xhorhas only see Rosohna as an unbroken link in the legacy of Ghor Dranas, a city born of malevolent gods and their murderous spawn.": "街道上热闹非凡，有居住在城市里的废人，有崇拜卢克松的乌鸦，他们生活在开放的天空下，对Lolth的设计不满，甚至还有一些duergar和其他来自地下世界的生物。随着Xhorhasian社区的发展，当地的商业也在蓬勃发展，地精商人也在这个黑暗精灵的文明中找到了利润和舒适。即便如此，Xhorhas边界以外的大多数人只把Rosohna看作是Ghor Dranas遗产中的一个不间断的环节，一个由邪恶的神和他们的凶残的卵子诞生的城市。",
	"As the Kryn discovered their cycle of reincarnation, many began to find beings outside the drow lineage undergoing anamnesis, the process in which a creature reincarnated by a {@item Luxon beacon|EGW} begins to recall memories from its past lives. Unexpectedly, the spirits of heroic Kryn were reborn in various intelligent creatures outside the dark elf society. With this knowledge, the ruling dens of the Kryn Dynasty began to reevaluate their treatment of non-drow, instead seeking to bring the light of the Luxon to the wastefolk of Xhorhas. While many beings across Xhorhas and beyond still cultivate mutual animosity toward the Kryn, there is a growing number of goblins, ogres, gnolls, orcs, and many other beings who have found a new home and purpose under the rule of the dynasty. Thanks to the miracle of anamnesis, Kryn society has become a diverse and thriving community that spreads across Xhorhas.": "随着克莱恩人发现他们的轮回，许多人开始发现乌鸦血统以外的生物正在经历无记性，即由{@item Luxon beacon|EGW}转世的生物开始回忆其前世的记忆的过程。出乎意料的是，英雄克莱恩的灵魂在黑暗精灵社会之外的各种智慧生物中重生。有了这些知识，克莱恩王朝的统治者们开始重新评估他们对非乌鸦的待遇，转而寻求将卢克逊的光芒带给Xhorhas的废人。虽然整个Xhorhas和其他地方的许多生命仍然对Kryn培养着相互的敌意，但有越来越多的地精、食人魔、地精、兽人和其他许多生命在王朝的统治下找到了新的家园和目标。由于失忆的奇迹，克莱恩社会已经成为一个多样化和繁荣的社区，遍布整个Xhorhas。",
	"The dark elf and duergar bloodlines are averse to sunlight, which presents a challenge to a culture that journeyed to the surface out of love for their light-bearing god. Periods of worship involve occasional prayer and meditation in the warmth of daylight, but twelve hours of daylight each day can become painful and physically detrimental to those beings adapted to subterranean life. To mitigate this problem, powerful dunamancers have woven arcane shields to temporarily block out the sun above Rosohna. Periods of days, sometimes weeks, will transpire in a state of perpetual evening, enabling the darkness-bound denizens to go about their work. Such periods briefly come to an end to usher in periods of scheduled, mass worship under the sunlight.": "黑暗精灵和duergar血统厌恶阳光，这对出于对其光明之神的热爱而前往地表的文化来说是一个挑战。崇拜期包括偶尔在温暖的日光下祈祷和冥想，但每天12个小时的日光对那些适应地下生活的生物来说是痛苦的，而且对身体有害。为了缓解这个问题，强大的地下工作者编织了奥术盾牌来暂时阻挡罗索纳上空的阳光。有几天时间，有时是几周，会出现一个永久的傍晚状态，使被黑暗束缚的居民能够进行他们的工作。这样的时期会短暂地结束，以迎来预定的、在阳光下的大规模崇拜时期。",
	"Rosohna is built on the remains of Ghor Dranas, and an entire, unseen level of the city lurks beneath the surface. These caves and tunnels were used as torture dungeons by worshipers of Torog, and the Dens of the Kryn have spent centuries reclaiming the space for their own people. Much of the dungeon remains abandoned, but a great many layers have been cleared and transformed into underground neighborhoods, hubs for subterranean travel across Wildemount, and farming caverns for crops of edible fungi. However, the Kryn Dynasty has secretly allowed some hidden chambers to fulfill their original grim purpose as cells for vile criminals and political prisoners.": "Rosohna建立在Ghor Dranas的遗迹上，整个城市的一个看不见的层面潜伏在地表之下。这些洞穴和隧道被托罗格的崇拜者用作酷刑地牢，而克莱恩之家花了几个世纪的时间为他们自己的人收回了这个空间。地牢的大部分仍然被遗弃，但有许多层已经被清理出来，并被改造成地下居民区、整个Wildemount的地下旅行枢纽，以及种植食用菌作物的农用洞穴。然而，克莱恩王朝已经秘密允许一些隐藏的房间履行其最初的严峻目的，作为卑鄙的罪犯和政治犯的牢房。",
	"The ruling class of the dynasty is seated in Rosohna, spread across twelve noble Dens—all of whom seek to one day rule the dynasty. They play an intricate political game by expanding their families of timeless souls and covertly undermining the authority of other Dens.": "王朝的统治阶层坐落在罗索纳，分布在12个贵族区--他们都试图有一天能统治王朝。他们通过扩大他们的永恒灵魂家族和暗中破坏其他Dens的权威，玩着复杂的政治游戏。",
	"Each Den traditionally oversees a portion of local industry, but the more distinguished Dens also vie for control over aspects of spiritual or military leadership. Den Masters keep a careful eye out for weakness among other Dens, seeking ways to sully the reputations of their rivals while displaying their own worthiness to the Bright Queen. Such social sabotage is reminiscent of the old ways of the drow, but assassinations and acts of outright violence are rare. The three ruling Dens—Den Kryn, Den Thelyss, and Den Mirimm—are each helmed by an Umavi. Of those families, Den Kryn holds supreme power, for its head is Bright Queen Leylas Kryn herself.": "每个巢穴传统上都监督着当地工业的一部分，但更杰出的巢穴也争夺对精神或军事领导方面的控制权。巢穴主人小心翼翼地留意其他巢穴的弱点，寻找方法来玷污对手的声誉，同时向光明女王展示他们自己的价值。这种社会破坏活动让人联想到鸦人的老办法，但暗杀和直接的暴力行为却很少。三个统治区--Den Kryn、Den Thelyss和Den Mirimm--分别由一个Umavi掌舵。在这些家族中，Den Kryn拥有最高的权力，因为它的首脑是光明女王Leylas Kryn本人。",
	"Conflict and struggle are as common in Rosohna as in any other metropolis, and though the unifying faith of the Luxon helps maintain the peace between disparate and sometimes violent residents, old habits are hard to break. Den Mirimm has enacted a tough, sometimes brutal approach to law enforcement that helps discourage violent behavior.": "冲突和斗争在罗索纳和其他大都市一样普遍，尽管卢克逊的统一信仰有助于维持不同的、有时是暴力的居民之间的和平，但旧的习惯很难打破。丹-米林颁布了严厉的、有时是残酷的执法方式，有助于阻止暴力行为的发生。",
	"Blackmail is common between political figures, and those that indulge in this vice believe that they can absolve any sins through pious prayer, reasoning that their actions are only illegal if they're caught.": "勒索在政治人物之间很常见，那些沉溺于这种恶习的人认为他们可以通过虔诚的祈祷来免除任何罪过，理由是他们的行为只有在被抓到时才是非法的。",
	"Those who have been found guilty of major crimes against the dynasty are locked away in the Dungeon of Penance (see \"Geography\" below), or taken out beyond the reach of the beacons and executed, with no hope of rebirth.": "那些被认定对王朝犯下重大罪行的人被关在忏悔地牢里（见下文 \"地理\"），或被带到烽火台以外的地方处决，没有重生的希望。",
	"Nestled protectively within a deep valley alongside the Penumbra Range, the majestic, ominous, and beautiful city long known as Ghor Dranas stands as a symbol of renewal and change. A vast medley of bright and wondrous structures, grandiose towers, and crystalline cathedrals soar into the sky, thriving among the broken remnants of a ruined metropolis that was once nothing but ash and haunted memories. Districts are laid out in the husk of the ancient capital like a series of layers, each ward growing more refined and enlightened the closer one gets to the center of the city. These layers are the Ghostlands, the Coronas, the Gallimaufry, the Firmaments, the Shadowshire, the Lucid Bastion, and the Dungeon of Penance.": "庄严的、不祥的、美丽的城市--古尔-德拉纳斯，保护性地依偎在佩南布拉山脉旁的一个深谷中，作为复兴和变化的象征而矗立。一大片明亮而奇妙的建筑、宏伟的塔楼和晶莹剔透的大教堂耸入云霄，在曾经只有灰烬和困扰的记忆的废墟残骸中蓬勃发展。在古都的废墟上，各区就像一连串的层次一样，每一个区都是越靠近城市中心就越精致、越开明的。这些层级包括鬼域（Ghostlands）、科罗纳斯（Coronas）、加里莫夫里（Gallimaufry）、苍穹（Firmaments）、阴影区（Shadowshire）、透明堡垒（Lucid Bastion）和忏悔地牢（Dungeon of Penance）。",
	"Large sections of the foreboding obsidian walls that once surrounded the city have fallen, but they are in the process of being rebuilt as the war with the empire grows more violent. Within these walls, the outlying Ghostlands remain empty, haunted by ghosts and shadows, the razed structures and barracks of the larger, ancient city left to crumble to dust. Two functional roads known as the Hallowed Paths allow caravans, travelers, and military forces to reach the city.": "曾经包围城市的黑曜石城墙有很大一部分已经倒塌，但随着与帝国的战争越来越激烈，它们正在被重建中。在这些城墙内，外围的鬼域仍然是空的，被鬼魂和阴影所困扰，更大的古城中被夷为平地的建筑和兵营被抛到了尘埃里。两条被称为 \"神圣之路 \"的功能性道路允许商队、旅行者和军事力量到达城市。",
	"Most of the city's poorer citizens are scattered throughout this sprawling, foggy district of salvaged structures and newer homesteads. Patches of magically maintained farmland are tilled and tended by nearby denizens, while industrial factories and bellows release stacks of black smoke and faintly colored steam. Aurora Watch captains coordinate law enforcement from three fortresses, while mercenaries, volunteers, and desperate folk often strike out into the Ghostlands with hopes of exorcising new neighborhoods to shelter the continuously growing population of Rosohna.": "这个城市的大多数穷人都散布在这个由残存的建筑和新的家园组成的无垠的雾区。附近居民耕种和打理着成片的经过魔法维护的农田，而工业工厂和风箱则释放出成堆的黑烟和微弱的彩色蒸汽。曙光守望者队长从三个要塞协调执法工作，而雇佣兵、志愿者和绝望的人们经常到鬼域出击，希望能驱除新的社区，以庇护不断增长的罗索纳人口。",
	"Deeper into the heart of Rosohna is the massive region called the Gallimaufry. The rowdiest and most vibrant ward of the city, the Gallimaufry marks the intersection of culture and commerce where citizens come to share ideas, peddle wares and services, find employment, or celebrate personal victories large and small in the company of other folk from the wastes. The area is lit with ever-burning lanterns of green light strung across street corners and roadways, and the percussive music of the wastefolk mingles with the haunting melodies of drow musicians to produce an ever-shifting atmosphere that many find at once both welcoming and claustrophobic.": "在罗索纳的中心地带，有一个被称为Gallimaufry的巨大区域。Gallimaufry是城市中最热闹和最有活力的区，标志着文化和商业的交汇点，市民们在这里分享想法，兜售商品和服务，寻找就业机会，或者在其他来自荒野的人的陪伴下庆祝个人的大小胜利。该地区的灯光是用不断燃烧的绿灯笼串联在街角和道路上，废土人的打击性音乐与鸦人音乐家的萦绕旋律交织在一起，产生了一种不断变化的气氛，许多人发现它既欢迎又幽闭。",
	"Near the center of Rosohna, travelers will find the Firmaments, where the haunted memory of Ghor Dranas has been erased with a beautiful district of glowing drow gardens, luxurious chapels to the Luxon, and the spacious halls of Marble Tomes Conservatory, the city's center of higher learning. Wealthy estates house Den members and figures of import to the dynasty, and the impressive towers of the Nimbus Keep loom over the region.

Less affluent dark elves live among the stone and glass abodes built into the rock and sediment. Caverns amass bioluminescent fungi to be harvested for food and medicine, while enchanted lanterns light the various levels with a soft and many-colored luminescence. A magical underground farmland has been established here, where sunless crops are grown to feed the city. The second entrance of the Dungeon of Penance is located within the Shadowshire.": "几条守卫森严的阶梯在苍穹之下蜿蜒而下，从Xhorhas的地表下降到阴影区，这是一个巨大的地下区域，建在Torog回收的监狱里。不太富裕的黑暗精灵生活在岩石和沉积物中的石头和玻璃房中。洞穴里聚集着生物发光的真菌，可以收获食物和药物，而施了魔法的灯笼则用柔和而多色的发光体照亮各个层面。这里建立了一个神奇的地下农田，在这里种植没有阳光的农作物，为城市提供食物。忏悔地牢的第二个入口位于阴影区内。",
	"The many levels of the Dungeon of Penance delve under the city. This terrifying oubliette bears the marks of the Kryn Dynasty's renovations on its upper levels, but become less explored and less changed from the days of Ghor Dranas the deeper one delves.": "忏悔地牢的许多层深入到城市的地下。这座可怕的地牢在上层有克莱恩王朝翻修的痕迹，但越往下走，探索的程度就越少，与古尔-德拉纳斯时代的变化也越小。",
	"As the largest prison within the dynasty, a microcosm of the dynasty itself can be found in the complex bureaucracy of jailors, supervisors, and elite Aurora Watch soldiers who guard the frigid halls of the dungeon.": "作为王朝内最大的监狱，在复杂的官僚体系中可以发现王朝本身的缩影，包括狱卒、监督员和守卫寒冷的地牢大厅的精锐曙光卫士。",

	"At the bottom of the deep Dreemoth Ravine lie the crumbled ruins of the once-proud nation of Draconia. The floating islands of the city-state were the original home of dragonborn society within Wildemount, though the ruling class installed a strict caste system and forced the tailless ravenite dragonborn to labor in the ravine below their magically elevated island city. When the city was assaulted by the Chroma Conclave two decades before, the islands were sundered and fell into the ravine, killing many of the inhabitants. However, this disaster gave the ravenites a chance to rebel against their cruel masters.": "在深邃的德雷莫斯峡谷的底部，坐落着曾经辉煌的德雷科尼亚国家的破碎废墟。这个城邦的浮动岛屿是野蛮人社会最初的家园，尽管统治阶级设置了严格的种姓制度，并强迫没有尾巴的乌鸦人龙裔在他们的魔法高架岛城下面的峡谷中劳动。二十年前，当这座城市被克罗姆协约国袭击时，岛屿被拆散并落入峡谷，许多居民被杀。然而，这场灾难给了乌鸦人一个机会来反抗他们残忍的主人。",

	"Those champions who were lost in the struggle are immortalized in statues left among the ruins, the most famous of whom is the hero Tiberius Stormwind of Draconia.

The horizonback shells are reinforced at the edges with jagged pikes and sharpened bones to help defend those who live atop, while bolt throwers and short-range catapults can be found throughout the neighborhoods. Every tortoise contains its own microcosm of a village, and denizens all take up skills to make the miniature community nearly self-sufficient, complete with moss farmers, blacksmiths, and physicians.": "乌尔津镇由大约四十只地平线背龟和数百个移动帐篷和小屋组成，这些帐篷和小屋随着每次搬迁而转移。这些乌龟的背上从前到后布满了摇摇欲坠的棚屋和营房，有时堆成野塔，用长绳和藤蔓将它们固定在原地。地平线背壳的边缘用锯齿状的长矛和削尖的骨头加固，以帮助保卫住在上面的人，而整个街区都可以找到螺栓投掷器和短程弹射器。每只乌龟都有自己的村庄的缩影，居民们都掌握了一些技能，使这个微型社区几乎自给自足，有苔藓农民、铁匠和医生。",

Shothotugg's arrival would almost certainly place New Haxon in jeopardy. The cult controls a crumbling dungeon complex below the ruins of Old Haxon.

Learned sages, however, suggest that the inhabitants of this island hamlet abandoned it long ago and journeyed into the mainlands of the Far Hharom peninsula. The nature of this exodus remains a mystery, but relics found scattered among Olc Skerry's crumbling wooden hovels and tenebrous seaside caves suggest the people of the village revered an unnamed pantheon of forgotten entities from the Far Realm.

Just outside the cave mouth, someone has planted a grim scarecrow with a rusted bucket helm for a head, and anyone who tampers with the helm causes the black gulls to form into three hostile swarms (use the {@creature swarm of ravens} stat block in appendix A of the {@book Monster Manual|MM}).

	"Some say this lawless harbor city is as dangerous as the arcane wilds of Blightshore that surround it. But whether or not visitors enjoy its chaotic disposition, Rotthold is an unmistakable center of travel and commerce in eastern Wildemount. The decayed stone dwellings and wooden tenements that line Rotthold's ramshackle streets are enveloped by a luminous, rust-colored moss that bathes the city's evenings in a sick crimson glow.

Most of the city's trade is conducted in East Rotthold, where a bazaar known as the Red Market takes up a majority of the quarter. On the south side of the city, Dockside is the purview of the Revelry and houses Rotthold's most affluent citizens, who no doubt believe they are safest when located as far away from Blightshore's savage interior as possible. On the west end of the city, the quarter known as Cairn Hill rests above a mysterious lattice of pre-Calamity catacombs. Here in Rotthold's graveyard, furtive agents meet in cemeteries to carry out their agendas.": "没有城墙保护罗特霍尔德不被周围的Blightshore荒原侵扰，但有11座瞭望塔作为防线。这座城市大致分为四个区。北罗托德，东罗托德，码头边，和凯恩山。北罗托德居住着城市中最贫穷的居民，他们经常遇到米斯卡斯河岸冲击的畸形野生动物。城市的大部分贸易是在东罗托德进行的，那里有一个被称为红色市场的集市，占据了大部分的区域。在城市的南边，码头区是 \"狂欢节 \"的管辖范围，那里住着罗特索德最富裕的市民，他们无疑认为尽可能远离Blightshore野蛮的内部是最安全的。在城市的西端，被称为 \"凯恩山 \"的街区位于前卡拉姆地下墓穴的神秘格子之上。在罗托尔德的墓地里，鬼鬼祟祟的特工们在墓地里聚会，执行他们的计划。",

Before his malign reign, this region of the Miskath Strand was a verdant haven for a long-lost nation of wood elves and centaurs. For reasons unknown, Karkethzerethzerus plotted to annihilate the woodland nation, killing it off with energies from the Shadowfell. Since doing exactly that, the Sable Despoiler has ruled Strathfell with equal measures of gleeful arrogance and baleful suspicion. The shadow dragon's lair, like his motives, remain hidden. Etheric rifts run throughout Strathfell's gloomy expanse, allowing denizens such as darklings and meenlocks to travel to and from the Shadowfell with unsettling regularity.

Many such perceptions have some basis in truth, but that truth has often been distorted by hearsay, prejudice, propaganda, or cultural misunderstandings.": "本节还包括一个来自Wildemount各主要地区--Dwendalian帝国、Menagerie海岸和Xhorhas--的典型人物可能对每个种族成员的看法。虽然这些描述中有些是准确的，但有些则代表了歪曲的看法或刻板印象。许多这样的看法都有一定的事实依据，但这种事实往往被传闻、偏见、宣传或文化误解所扭曲。",
	"In addition to the races of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, Wildemount is home to many other races, including the following:": "除了{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}的种族外，怀德蒙也是许多其他种族的家园，包括以下。",

	"Dwarves' long memories give them uncommon insight into the world of the past. However, this connection to the past can make their societies resistant to change, even when change is desperately needed.": "矮人的漫长记忆使他们对过去的世界有不寻常的洞察力。然而，这种与过去的联系会使他们的社会对变革产生抵触，即使是在迫切需要变革的时候。",
	"Most folk in the Dwendalian Empire think of dwarves as greedy, cave-dwelling hermits with a passion only for jewelry, drinking, and fighting. Most dwarves in the empire come from the city-state of Grimgolir and its settlements under the Dunrock Mountains, whose miners, jewelers, and warriors are some of the finest in the empire.": "德温达里亚帝国的大多数人都认为矮人是贪婪的、住在洞穴里的隐士，只热衷于珠宝、喝酒和战斗。帝国的大多数矮人都来自格林戈里尔城邦和敦罗克山下的定居点，他们的矿工、珠宝商和战士都是帝国中最优秀的。",
	"Imperial beer, particularly smooth, sweet Trost ale from Trostenwald, is a delicacy among Grimgol dwarves. The people who lived beneath the mountains never grew wheat or hops, and so never brewed beer. Until the dwarves began trading with humans from the long-fallen Julous Dominion, dwarven liquor was a potent, ugly-smelling spirit called rütga, distilled from heavy root vegetables.": "帝国啤酒，特别是来自特罗斯特瓦尔德的光滑、甜美的特罗斯特啤酒，是格林戈尔矮人的美味佳肴。生活在山下的人们从未种植过小麦或啤酒花，因此也从未酿制过啤酒。在矮人开始与来自早已衰落的朱鲁斯统治区的人类进行贸易之前，矮人的酒是一种烈性的、气味难闻的烈酒，叫做吕特加，由沉重的根茎植物蒸馏而成。",
	"Along the Menagerie Coast, most folk see dwarves as foreigners possessed of fiery passions and an eagerness for action. Dwarves are uncommon visitors on the coast, with most coming from the distant realms of Tal'Dorei and Marquet as sailors or travelers, as pirates from the notorious Revelry, or as soldiers from the Dwendalian Empire.": "在Menagerie海岸，大多数人认为矮人是拥有火热激情和急于行动的外国人。矮人是海岸上不常见的访客，大多数来自遥远的塔尔多雷和马尔凯王国的水手或旅行者，来自臭名昭著的雷弗里的海盗，或来自德温达里亚帝国的士兵。",
	"Ancient legends tell of dwarves living in mountaintop citadels in the ominous Cyrios Mountains, performing strange rituals that call upon the power of the Storm Lord. Along the coast, stories of the strong passion and swift judgment of the dwarves are often a product of the legends of these religious zealots. But these beliefs have been strengthened in modern times by the clear-eyed marquis of Port Zoon, Alamads Haddou, who lays down laws in plain language and enacts swift justice by the letter of those laws.": "古老的传说中，矮人居住在不祥的赛里奥斯山脉的山顶堡垒中，举行奇怪的仪式，召唤风暴之神的力量。在沿海地区，关于矮人强烈的激情和迅速的判断力的故事往往是这些宗教狂热者的传说的产物。但这些信仰在现代得到了佐恩港的清明侯爵阿拉马兹-哈杜的加强，他以平实的语言制定法律，并根据这些法律的字面意思制定迅速的司法。",
	"Dwarves are few and far between in Xhorhas, and those few who remain are known as duergar, or \"deep dwarves.\" Though some duergar have joined with the Kryn Dynasty and dwell on the surface, most live in the ancient tunnels of the Underdark and harbor a deep-seated enmity for the drow.": "矮人在Xhorhas很少，剩下的少数人被称为duergar，或 \"深层矮人\"。虽然有些杜尔加人加入了克莱恩王朝并居住在地表，但大多数人都生活在地下世界的古老隧道中，并对乌鸦怀有根深蒂固的敌意。",
	"Duergar insurgents, striking Kryn settlements or seeking hidden paths toward the surface from perhaps a dozen small outposts in the Underdark, are trying to carve out their own underground dominion. Kryn forces have been successful in holding onto their underground territories so far, but many generals fear that the war in the west is drawing more and more soldiers from their fortifications in the Underdark. If duergar aggression is left unchecked, territory might inevitably have to be ceded to the insurgents.": "杜尔加叛乱分子袭击克莱恩定居点，或从暗黑世界的十几个小前哨寻找通往地表的隐秘路径，试图开辟他们自己的地下统治。到目前为止，克莱恩部队成功地守住了他们的地下领土，但许多将军担心，西部的战争正在吸引越来越多的士兵离开他们在地下世界的防御工事。如果杜尔加人的侵略不受控制，领土可能不可避免地要被割让给叛乱分子。",
	"When Exandria trembled at the gods' footfalls, the ancient elves of the north pleaded with the Arch Heart to save them from the world's ending. Corellon did not respond, for it is said that their divine ears still rang with pain after their duel to the death with Gruumsh, the Ruiner. Desperate and panicked, the greatest mages of the elves performed a ritual powerful enough to encase their entire civilization in ice, in hopes of protecting it from the wrath of the warring gods while the elves escaped into the Feywild.": "当埃克桑德里亚在诸神的脚步声中颤抖时，北方的古老精灵们恳求拱卫之心将他们从世界末日中拯救出来。科瑞隆没有回应，因为据说他们的神耳在与毁灭者格鲁姆什的生死决斗后仍然响着疼痛。在绝望和恐慌中，精灵们最伟大的法师们举行了一个足以将他们的整个文明包裹在冰中的仪式，希望能在精灵们逃入精灵世界的同时，保护他们免遭战神的愤怒。",
	"It is said that the ashes of the Calamity still blew upon the breeze when, centuries later, the barriers of ice melted and the elves of Wildemount emerged from the Feywild once more. On their return to the world, they found that their ritual had not held fast. The Calamity had wiped almost all traces of elven civilization from Exandria. With only the ruined husks of their mighty cities still standing, the elves began to rebuild.": "据说，当几个世纪后，冰雪的屏障融化，野人山的精灵们再次从仙境中走出来时，灾难的灰烬仍然在微风中吹拂。当他们回到这个世界时，他们发现他们的仪式并没有坚持下去。灾难几乎抹去了埃克桑德里亚的所有精灵文明的痕迹。只有他们强大的城市的废墟还在，精灵们开始重建。",
	"Even though the human-majority civilizations of the Dwendalian Empire and the Clovis Concord view elves as reclusive relics of the ancient past, most elves view themselves as newcomers to the world, for their return to Wildemount is only a generation or two removed from the present day. The notable exception are the dark elves of Xhorhas, who have lived in Eastern Wynandir since time immemorial. Still, it is only in the past few centuries that they have abandoned the labyrinthine caverns of the Underdark and emerged to live on the surface.": "尽管以人类为主体的德文达尔帝国和克洛维斯协约文明将精灵视为远古时代的隐秘遗迹，但大多数精灵将自己视为这个世界的新来者，因为他们回到怀德蒙的时间与现在只差一两代。值得注意的例外是Xhorhas的黑暗精灵，他们自古以来就生活在东Wynandir。不过，也只是在过去的几个世纪里，他们才放弃了地下世界的迷宫般的洞穴，出现在地面上生活。",
	"Though the dark elves of Xhorhas are the subject of imperial propaganda and widespread prejudice, elves of other kinds living within the empire are generally treated as friends and allies. Imperial humans love to revere elves as ethereal, flawless beings, and to express shock when elves reveal the ways that they are all-to similar to humans. Elves who maintain their \"exotic mystique\" are most likely to become respected members of society, and many hold great social power within cities such as Zadash and Rexxentrum.": "虽然Xhorhas的黑暗精灵是帝国宣传和普遍偏见的对象，但生活在帝国内的其他种类的精灵通常被视为朋友和盟友。帝国的人类喜欢把精灵当作虚无缥缈、完美无瑕的生命来推崇，而当精灵透露出他们与人类完全相似的方式时，他们会表示震惊。保持其 \"异国情调的神秘感 \"的精灵最有可能成为受人尊敬的社会成员，许多人在扎达什和雷克森特姆等城市拥有巨大的社会权力。",
	"Elves are commonplace in the Clovis Concord and among the pirates of the Revelry, and people living on this part of the continent most often laugh at tales of elven grace and beauty. \"An elf bleeds just like everyone else\" is a common saying on the Menagerie Coast, used to dismiss the fanciful sense of wonder common in the Empire—and the saying has evolved into a dismissal of all overwrought tales, even if the idiom doesn't quite fit. Savvy buyers of curios and souvenirs might say, \"Your wares bleed, just like everyone else's\" to a merchant who has exaggerated the quality of their goods.": "精灵在克洛维斯康科德和启示录的海盗中很常见，生活在大陆这一部分的人们最常嘲笑的是关于精灵优雅和美丽的故事。\"精灵和其他人一样会流血 \"是Menagerie海岸的一句俗语，用来否定帝国常见的奇幻感--这句话已经演变成了对所有夸张故事的否定，即使这个成语并不完全适合。精明的古玩和纪念品买家可能会对夸大商品质量的商人说：\"你的东西在流血，就像其他人的一样\"。",
	"Most elves on the Menagerie Coast are descended from travelers from the desert continent of Marquet, but this area is also home to two rare subraces of elf. The seas off the coast are inhabited by secluded civilizations of water-breathing sea elves, who trade with underwater enclaves of merfolk. All but the most idealistic or mercenary of these ocean dwellers see the petty squabbles of the \"boat-riders\" of the surface world as beneath their notice. At another geographic extreme, the moon-worshiping pallid elves of the Cyrios Mountains are new to the world, and are generally viewed with cordial curiosity by the denizens of the Concord's cities.": "曼纳吉海岸的大多数精灵都是来自沙漠大陆马奎特的旅行者的后代，但这个地区也是两个罕见的精灵亚族的家园。海岸附近的海域居住着隐蔽的水呼吸的海精灵文明，他们与水下的人鱼族飞地进行贸易。除了最理想主义的人或最唯利是图的人之外，所有这些海洋居民都认为表面世界的 \"乘船者 \"的小争吵不在他们的考虑范围之内。在另一个地理极端，赛里奥斯山脉的月亮崇拜者苍白的精灵是这个世界的新成员，一般来说，协约国城市的居民对他们抱有亲切的好奇心。",
	"The largest elf-majority civilization in Wildemount is the Kryn Dynasty of Xhorhas, which is made up primarily of dark elves. The drow of Xhorhas are respectful toward people of all races—including other elves—as they believe that their holy cycle of rebirth allows them to be reborn into non-drow bodies. The empathy to be gained by experiencing life in another body is crucial to their religion and their culture.": "Wildemount最大的以精灵为主体的文明是Xhorhas的Kryn王朝，它主要由黑暗精灵组成。Xhorhas的乌鸦对所有种族的人都很尊重，包括其他精灵，因为他们相信他们神圣的重生循环可以让他们重生到非乌鸦的身体里。通过体验另一个身体的生活而获得的同理心对他们的宗教和文化至关重要。",
	"Elves who live outside the Luxon's cycle of rebirth are viewed with pity, for they have not yet seen the true path. Elves who dwell within the Dwendalian Empire are a notable exception, their imperial allegiance earning them only the cold bite of a blade.": "生活在卢克逊的重生循环之外的精灵被人怜悯地看待，因为他们还没有看到真正的道路。居住在德温达里安帝国的精灵是一个明显的例外，他们对帝国的忠诚只赢得了刀剑的冷酷。",
	"At the DM's discretion, players have access to the pallid elf and sea elf subraces described below, in addition to the elf subraces in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}.": "根据DM的决定，除了{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的精灵子种族外，玩家还可以使用下面描述的苍白精灵和海精灵子种族。",
	"Nearly every race in Exandria has an origin myth or two. The stories vary from realm to realm, but it's clear that Corellon the Arch Heart wove the elves from grass, Moradin the All-Hammer carved the dwarves from earth, and so on. Halflings across Wildemount have no such stories, and no faiths tell of their god creating the small folk. Some speculate that Avandra the Change Bringer placed halflings in the world, but despite some of Ioun's most devout priests petitioning their god to reveal the truth of the halflings' creation, the Knowing Mentor has remained infuriatingly coy on the topic.": "艾克桑德里亚的每个种族几乎都有一两个起源神话。各个王国的故事各不相同，但很明显，拱心者科雷隆用草编织了精灵，全能者莫拉丁用土雕刻了矮人，诸如此类。Wildemount各地的半身人没有这样的故事，也没有信仰告诉他们的神创造了小民。有些人猜测是 \"变化使者 \"阿凡达将半身人放在这个世界上，但尽管伊恩最虔诚的牧师们向他们的神请愿，要求揭示半身人被创造的真相，但 \"知识导师 \"在这个问题上一直保持着令人生气的沉默。",
	"For their part, halflings in the Dwendalian Empire and the Menagerie Coast don't much care where they came from. All they know is that they walked out of a hole in the ground one day to find a beautiful world spread out before them. Some longed to explore to that world's farthest horizons, while others were content to gaze upon the beauty of the same sunrise each morning. Plenty of halflings have joined the Cobalt Soul over the years in desperate search of answers to the world's big questions—where did we come from, and where are we going? But most halflings are content to leave the questions of past and future well enough alone, simply living in the present.": "就他们而言，德文达尔帝国和动物园海岸的半身人并不太关心他们来自哪里。他们只知道有一天他们从一个地洞里走出来，发现一个美丽的世界展现在他们面前。一些人渴望探索这个世界最遥远的地平线，而另一些人则满足于每天早晨凝视同一个日出的美丽。多年来，大量的半身人加入了科博特之魂，拼命寻找世界大问题的答案--我们从哪里来，我们要去哪里？但大多数半身人都满足于把过去和未来的问题抛在一边，只是活在当下。",
	"Generations ago, the halflings of the Felder clan established a settlement now known as Felderwin Tillage, and discovered in time that they had inadvertently created an agricultural powerhouse. The word \"halfling\" has been synonymous with a simple, rural lifestyle ever since.": "几代人以前，费尔德氏族的半身人建立了一个定居点，现在被称为费尔德温耕地，并及时发现他们无意中创造了一个农业强国。从那时起，\"半身人 \"这个词就成了简单的农村生活方式的代名词。",
	"The dutiful, orderly people of the Dwendalian Empire most often think of halflings as carefree country bumpkins. In a nation obsessed with its heritage and its legacy, the stereotypical halfling philosophy of living life in the moment is viewed as pathetically unambitious.": "Dwendalian帝国尽职尽责、井然有序的人们最常认为半身人是无忧无虑的乡巴佬。在一个痴迷于其传统和遗产的国家里，半身人刻板的生活哲学被认为是可悲的没有野心的。",
	"People in this part of the world have no real assumptions about halflings. Most perceive them on a level with humans, having similar ambitions, virtues, and vices. The only difference is that halflings are a wee bit smaller from prow to stern and a fair bit bigger from port to starboard.": "在这个地区的人们对半身人没有真正的假设。大多数人认为他们与人类处于同一水平，有类似的野心、美德和恶习。唯一的区别是，半身人从船头到船尾都要小一点，从左舷到右舷都要大一点。",
	"Halflings are common enough in the Clovis Concord that just about every vessel, shop, tavern, coffee house, and brothel has been designed with halflings and gnomes in mind. Stairs often have shallow steps for small legs, stools feature hand-cranks to adjust their height up or down, and most restaurants have utensils sized for small hands.": "半身人在克洛维斯康科德非常普遍，几乎所有的船只、商店、酒馆、咖啡馆和妓院的设计都考虑到了半身人和侏儒。楼梯通常有适合小腿的浅台阶，凳子有手摇器，可以上下调节高度，大多数餐馆都有适合小手使用的餐具。",
	"Few Xhorhasians have ever seen a halfling except for the occasional halfling soldier in Dwendalian armor. Because of this, most Kryn citizens view halflings as icons of the empire and are quick to distrust them. Only the Lotusden halflings, a reclusive and insular clan native to the Lotusden Greenwood, call Xhorhas home.": "除了偶尔有穿戴德文达尔盔甲的半身人士兵外，很少有Xhorhasians见过半身人。正因为如此，大多数克莱恩公民将半身人视为帝国的象征，并很快不信任他们。只有Lotusden半身人，一个隐居在Lotusden绿林中的孤僻部族，将Xhorhas作为家园。",
	"At the DM's discretion, players have access to the {@race halfling (lotusden)|EGW|lotusden halfling} subrace, in addition to the halfling subraces in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}.": "根据DM的决定，除了{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的半身人亚种之外，玩家还可以使用{@race halfling (lotusden)|EGW|lotusden halfling}亚种。",
	"The most populous race in Wildemount, humans define common culture across the continent. Their unrelenting ambition creates societies that aggressively pursue productivity while valuing leisure, and their short life spans often lead humans to romanticize the ugly past and fear the unknown future.": "人类是Wildemount人口最多的种族，定义了整个大陆的共同文化。他们不屈不挠的雄心壮志创造了在重视休闲的同时积极追求生产力的社会，而他们短暂的寿命往往导致人类浪漫化丑陋的过去，害怕未知的未来。",
	"In the Dwendalian Empire, humans are everywhere and occupy every walk of imperial life.": "在德文达尔帝国，人类无处不在，占据了帝国生活的每一个角落。",
	"Humans recoil from the unknown in ways that longer-lived folk do not, and nations dominated by a nonhuman majority are a tremendous source of fear and suspicion to human-majority nations. Human survival instinct stokes the flames of fear, especially when those flames are amply fueled by nationalistic propaganda. Such is the relationship between the Dwendalian Empire and the drow-majority Kryn Dynasty of Xhorhas.": "人类对未知事物的畏惧是长寿民族所不具备的，而由非人类占多数的国家对人类占多数的国家来说是一个巨大的恐惧和怀疑的来源。人类的生存本能激起了恐惧的火焰，特别是当这些火焰被民族主义的宣传所充分激发的时候。这就是德文达里亚帝国和以乌鸦为主的Xhorhas的Kryn王朝之间的关系。",
	"Other societies—including Uthodurn's pluralistic society of elves and dwarves—are less maligned. However, this is because the average citizen of the empire knows nothing about those societies, reducing them to objects of curiosity for imperial scholars.": "其他社会--包括乌索杜恩的精灵和矮人的多元社会--受到的诋毁较少。然而，这是因为帝国的普通公民对这些社会一无所知，使他们沦为帝国学者们的好奇对象。",
	"Within the Clovis Concord, humans are seen as adept diplomats, nation builders, and loyal soldiers. They are the most populous people of the Menagerie Coast, but ever since the founding of the Clovis Concord, that nation has been one defined by its diversity. Although other nations of Wildemount and the world might consider humans to be the definitive, adaptable jacks-of-all-trades, the people of the Concord know that all folk have this capacity.": "在Clovis Concord中，人类被视为精明的外交家、国家建设者和忠诚的士兵。他们是Menagerie海岸人口最多的民族，但自从Clovis Concord成立以来，这个国家就被定义为一个多元化的国家。虽然怀德蒙和世界上的其他国家可能会认为人类是绝对的、适应性强的万能战士，但康科德的人们知道，所有的人都有这种能力。",
	"Humans are rare in Xhorhas, and those found within that land typically belong to wandering clans or are soldiers of the Dwendalian Empire. Aside from such soldiers, humans are not viewed with inherent suspicion by most Xhorhasians, but the war between the Kryn Dynasty and the Dwendalian Empire has made Xhorhas an even more dangerous land for all human travelers. Dark elves and monsters that might treat a wandering human with caution elsewhere are likely to attack on sight in Xhorhas, because they know that an imperial human will do the same to them.": "人类在Xhorhas很罕见，在那片土地上发现的人类通常属于流浪的部族，或者是Dwendalian帝国的士兵。除了这样的士兵之外，大多数Xhorhasian人对人类并没有固有的怀疑，但是Kryn王朝和Dwendalian帝国之间的战争使得Xhorhas对于所有的人类旅行者来说是一个更加危险的土地。黑暗精灵和怪物在其他地方可能会谨慎对待一个流浪的人类，但在Xhorhas却很可能一见到就攻击，因为他们知道，一个帝国的人类也会对他们采取同样的做法。",
	"Within the empire, most aarakocra keep to the hidden settlement of Vol'antim in the Cyrios Mountains. The appearance of an aarakocra is seen as a blessing in the settlements of the Truscan Vale and the Marrow Valley—often much to the aarakocra's embarrassment. Most rural folk consider the aarakocra to be angels of Erathis the Law Bearer, no matter how diligently the aarakocra explain otherwise.": "在帝国内部，大多数阿拉科克拉都躲在西里欧斯山脉的隐蔽定居点Vol'antim。aarakocra的出现在特拉斯坎谷和马罗谷的定居点被视为一种祝福--往往让arakocra感到很尴尬。大多数农村居民认为阿拉科克拉是法律持有者埃拉西斯的天使，无论阿拉科克拉如何努力解释，都是如此。",
	"The few aarakocra who descend from the Cyrios Mountains or emerge from the canopy of the Quoraska Jungle for longer than a day or two are often swept up in the beauty of the sea. Thus enamored, many join a ship's crew and set out to explore the Lucidian Ocean with their new allies. The common people of the Menagerie Coast look upon the aarakocra's bright wings with awe and dream about taking to the sky, but are often baffled by their seemingly nonsensical idioms and figures of speech.": "少数从赛里奥斯山脉下来或从科拉斯卡丛林的树冠上走出来的阿拉科克拉人超过一两天的时间，常常被大海的美景所吸引。这样一来，许多人就加入了船队，与他们的新盟友一起开始探索卢西德海洋。巨兽海岸的普通人以敬畏之心看待阿拉科克拉明亮的翅膀，并梦想着飞上天空，但他们常常被他们看似无意义的成语和说话方式所迷惑。",
	"Aarakocra are native to the mountains and jungles of western Wildemount, and have precious few settlements in the mountains surrounding Xhorhas. The average Kryn dark elf would react to the sight of an aarakocra with shock, for they have neither stories nor experience with such creatures.": "Aarakocra原产于Wildemount西部的山脉和丛林中，在Xhorhas周围的山脉中，只有极少数的定居点。一般的克里恩黑暗精灵看到阿拉科克拉会有震惊的反应，因为他们对这种生物既没有故事也没有经验。",
	"The light of the gods still shines upon Exandria, even from behind the Divine Gate. Aasimar are the purest expression of that divine light as it burns within every mortal soul, for the souls of those blessed with an angelic ancestor blaze brighter than any other. Even rarer than the tieflings with whom they share a commonality of ancestry, aasimar are mortal, and yet are understood to be destined for a grander cosmic purpose than others around them. In every culture across the continent of Wildemount, the birth of an aasimar is seen as a blessing and a portent.": "众神之光仍然照耀着埃克桑德里亚，即使是在神门之后。Aasimar是神光最纯粹的表现，因为它在每个凡人的灵魂中燃烧，因为那些受到天使祖先祝福的人的灵魂比其他任何人都更加明亮。比起与他们有着共同祖先的铁弗林，阿西玛人甚至更罕见，他们是凡人，但却被理解为注定要比周围的人有更伟大的宇宙使命。在整个Wildemount大陆的每一种文化中，Aasimar的诞生被视为一种祝福和预兆。",
	"Aasimar who can bear the burden of their destiny become champions of noble causes, and encourage others to walk always in the light. More often than not, however, an aasimar saddled with a vague destiny and the grand aspirations of their clan ultimately falls from grace, their inner light succumbing to shadow.": "能够承受自己命运重担的阿西玛人成为崇高事业的拥护者，并鼓励其他人永远走在光明之中。然而，更多的时候，一个被模糊的命运和他们部族的宏伟愿望所困扰的阿西玛人最终会跌落神坛，他们内心的光芒屈服于阴影。",
	"To a law-abiding family worshiping state-approved gods, the birth of an aasimar child is nothing short of a miracle. Such a child is not only promised a charmed life, but elevates the social status of their family. However, to a family that secretly worships gods outlawed by the empire, the birth of a child touched by an angel of such deities is a mixed blessing. If the event draws the scrutiny of a settlement's idolmaster and their cronies, it might force family members to flee their homes for the Greying Wildlands or the Menagerie Coast.": "对于一个崇拜国家认可的神灵的守法家庭来说，阿西玛尔孩子的出生不啻为一个奇迹。这样的孩子不仅可以获得迷人的生活，而且可以提高他们家庭的社会地位。然而，对于一个秘密崇拜被帝国取缔的神灵的家庭来说，被这种神灵的天使触动的孩子的诞生是一种混合的祝福。如果这一事件引起了一个定居点的神职人员和他们的亲信的注意，它可能会迫使家庭成员逃离他们的家园，前往灰暗荒野或动物世界海岸。",
	"In the Clovis Concord, the cosmopolitan melting pot of Wildemount, most folk are inured to the sight of unusual and remarkable people. Even so, aasimar are a sight to behold, and there are many who don't mind being rude if it means spending a few extra seconds staring at a radiant aasimar as they pass by.": "在克洛维斯康科德，维尔德蒙的国际大熔炉中，大多数人都对不寻常的杰出人物见怪不怪了。即便如此，阿西玛人也是一道亮丽的风景线，而且有许多人不介意粗鲁，如果这意味着在他们经过时多花几秒钟盯着光芒四射的阿西玛人。",
	"Those in the Kryn Dynasty who study dunamancy see aasimar as brimming with near-limitless potential. As such, aasimar are often sought out from birth to be trained as dunamancers and echo knights. The tribesfolk who wander Xhorhas see the birth of an aasimar as a message from the gods, and their shamans ascribe meaning to that birth by the conditions of the world. An aasimar born during a raging storm might be a word of warning from Kord the Storm Lord, whereas an aasimar whose mother gave birth in a field of flowers could be a vow of protection from Melora the Wild Mother.": "克林王朝中那些研究地下魔法的人认为阿西玛人充满了近乎无限的潜力。因此，阿西玛人往往一出生就被寻找出来，被训练成地下魔法师和回声骑士。徘徊在Xhorhas的部落居民将aasimar的出生视为来自神灵的信息，他们的巫师根据世界的状况为其出生赋予了意义。一个在暴风雨中出生的阿西玛尔可能是来自风暴之神科德的警告，而一个母亲在花田中分娩的阿西玛尔可能是来自野性之母梅罗拉的保护誓言。",
	"Wildemount was the cradle from which all dragonborn civilization grew. The city-state of Draconia rose in the Dreemoth Ravine along the southern edge of the continent, when foreign dragonkin fleeing the gods' wrath during the Calamity forged an alliance with native dragonborn already dwelling there. The colonizing dragonborn, who called themselves draconbloods, worked with the native dragonborn, called ravenites, to build a society that could withstand the wandering monsters of Xhorhas. However, Draconia swiftly descended into corruption and bigotry, and the draconblood ruling class betrayed and enslaved their ravenite kin.": "荒野山庄是所有龙族文明发展的摇篮。德拉科尼亚城邦崛起于大陆南部边缘的德雷莫斯峡谷，当时在灾变期间逃离诸神之怒的外国龙人与已经居住在那里的本地龙人结成联盟。自称为龙血人的殖民龙人与被称为乌鸦人的本地龙人合作，建立了一个可以抵御Xhorhas流浪怪物的社会。然而，德拉科尼亚迅速陷入了腐败和偏执，龙血人统治阶层背叛并奴役了他们的乌鸦人亲属。",
	"Twenty years ago, Draconia was destroyed by the ire of the mighty Chroma Conclave, and the city-state's ruins were occupied by an ancient white dragon named Vorugal. The chaos of the attack upended draconblood civilization, and the ravenite slaves rose up and drove their former masters from the Dreemoth Ravine. Now masters of their own fate, the ravenite dragonborn have rebuilt their home within the ravine and have begun to spread out across the world.": "20年前，德拉科尼亚被强大的卓玛协约国的愤怒所摧毁，城邦的废墟被一条名为沃鲁加尔的古老白龙占领。攻击的混乱颠覆了龙血人的文明，乌鸦奴隶们奋起反抗，将他们以前的主人赶出了德雷莫斯峡谷。现在，鸦人龙裔是自己命运的主人，他们在峡谷中重建了自己的家园，并开始向世界各地扩散。",
	"You can allow a player to choose one of the following dragonborn variants.": "你可以让玩家选择以下龙裔变体之一。",
	"The Dwendalian Empire has seen a massive influx of dragonborn since the fall of Draconia. Most of the draconblood nobles who fled into the empire tried to use their grandiloquent names and titles to earn favors and prestige. But without the power of a nation-state behind them, many of those former slave owners were forced into lives of farming or hard labor. Some in the empire speak in awed whispers of the \"former dragonborn princes\" who now live as paupers, while others scoff at these haughty dragonborn's delusions of grandeur.": "自从德拉科尼亚沦陷后，德文达里亚帝国出现了大量的龙裔涌入。大多数逃入帝国的龙血人贵族都试图用他们宏大的名字和头衔来赢得恩惠和威望。但由于没有民族国家的力量作后盾，许多曾经的奴隶主被迫过着务农或苦役的生活。帝国中的一些人以敬畏的口吻谈论着 \"前龙裔王子\"，他们现在过着贫民的生活，而其他人则嘲笑这些傲慢的龙裔的宏伟幻想。",
	"Many ravenites have journeyed to the Dwendalian Empire in the years since the death of Vorugal, but the first of those found a colder reception than was given their former masters. The empire had no desire to grant asylum to revolutionaries, and would have turned the ravenites away had the Cerberus Assembly not intervened. For reasons unknown, the Assembly created the shantytown of Talonstadt for displaced ravenites, allowing them to trade labor for lodging there.": "在沃鲁加尔死后的几年里，许多乌鸦人来到了德文达尔帝国，但其中的第一批人发现比他们以前的主人受到的接待更冷淡。帝国并不想为革命者提供庇护，如果不是瑟伯勒斯大会的介入，乌鸦人就会被拒绝。由于未知的原因，议会为流离失所的乌鸦人建立了塔伦施塔特棚户区，允许他们在那里用劳动换取住宿。",
	"Many of the draconbloods fleeing their ruined city-state settled among the people of the Clovis Concord. Some had beach homes and private villas to flee to, and were able to establish businesses with the money they had stashed away there. Others were not so fortunate, and were forced to take menial jobs to make ends meet. Many residents of the Clovis Concord feel a twinge of sympathy for the draconblood exiles, but most commoners who have any knowledge of the ravenite uprising see this life of servitude as just punishment.": "许多逃离废墟城邦的龙血人在克洛维康科德的人民中定居下来。有些人有海滨住宅和私人别墅可供逃亡，并能用他们藏在那里的钱建立企业。其他人就没那么幸运了，他们被迫从事低级工作以维持生计。许多克洛维斯康科德的居民对龙血人的流亡感到一丝同情，但大多数对乌鸦起义有任何了解的平民认为这种奴役生活只是一种惩罚。",
	"Many of the ravenites who travel to the warm sands of the coast are merchants or wealthy generals or politicians on vacation. As such, all ravenites on the Menagerie Coast are assumed to have wealth—even exiles or penniless adventurers. Any tailless dragonborn who wanders through the cities of the Clovis Concord must constantly fend off hucksters, peddlers, and thieves.": "许多来到海岸温暖沙地的乌鸦人都是商人或富有的将军或政治家在度假。因此，Menagerie海岸的所有乌鸦人都被认为拥有财富--即使是流亡者或身无分文的冒险家。任何在克洛维康德的城市中游荡的无尾龙人都必须不断地抵御小贩、小贩和盗贼。",
	"Countless draconbloods fled into the wastes of Xhorhas in search of asylum, and some even dared approach the intimidating walls of Rosohna. The dark elves of the Kryn Dynasty were eager to welcome these formerly isolated people into their ranks—though their reasons for doing so were less than altruistic. More dragonborn living within range of the Luxon's beacons deepens the well of experiences that drow engaged in anamnesis can draw from, bringing their people closer to true enlightenment. The dark elves have no interest in the rift between the draconbloods and the ravenites, and treat both peoples as equals.": "无数的龙血人逃到Xhorhas的荒野中寻找庇护，有些人甚至敢于接近令人生畏的罗索纳城墙。克林王朝的黑暗精灵们热切地欢迎这些曾经与世隔绝的人加入他们的行列--尽管他们这样做的原因并不那么利他。更多的龙裔生活在卢克逊的信标范围内，加深了从事失忆的乌鸦可以汲取的经验之井，使他们的人民更接近真正的启蒙。黑暗精灵对龙血人和乌鸦人之间的裂痕没有兴趣，他们平等地对待这两个民族。",
	"{@race Firbolg|vgm|Firbolgs} are a forest-dwelling race native to the Greying Wildlands, particularly the mysterious Savalirwood. Their bodies are covered with thick fur ranging from tones of earthen brown and ruddy red to cool grays and blues, and even to wild hues of pink and green. Their bodies are bovine or camelid in appearance, with floppy, pointed ears and broad, pink noses, but they are bipedal and have hands that can manipulate weapons and objects.": "{@race Firbolg|vgm|Firbolgs}是一个居住在森林里的种族，原产于绿化荒地，特别是神秘的萨瓦里尔森林。他们的身体覆盖着厚厚的毛皮，从土褐色和红润的色调到冷灰色和蓝色，甚至是粉色和绿色的野生色调。它们的身体在外观上是牛或骆驼的，有松软的尖耳朵和宽大的粉红色鼻子，但它们是两足动物，有一双手可以操纵武器和物体。",
	"Most firbolgs live in extended family units, and it is unusual to find one living alone. However, they are introverted to the point where they seldom engage with other firbolgs outside the family unit, and firbolgs rarely form their own cities, villages, or even large tribes. Despite this, many firbolgs enjoy visiting other nations' settlements for a short time for trade, sightseeing, and to visit friends.": "大多数枞树人生活在大家庭中，单独生活的情况并不多见。然而，他们很内向，很少与家庭单位以外的其他枞树人打交道，而且枞树人很少形成自己的城市、村庄，甚至是大部落。尽管如此，许多枞树人喜欢短期访问其他国家的定居点，进行贸易、观光和拜访朋友。",
	"Most imperial citizens have never even heard of firbolgs. Stories involving these folk are rare, and typically liken them to the giants, depicting firbolgs as hulking humanoid warriors rather than fur-covered nature lovers. People living in the great crossroads city of Zadash might be familiar with one firbolg in particular: the jolly, eccentric enchanter known as Pumat Sol. This familiarity means that many warm quickly to new firbolgs, albeit after some initial surprise.": "大多数帝国公民甚至从未听说过枞树人。涉及这些人的故事很少，通常把他们比作巨人，把枞树人描绘成笨重的人形战士，而不是毛皮覆盖的自然爱好者。生活在伟大的十字路口城市扎达什的人们可能特别熟悉一个枞树人：被称为Pumat Sol的快乐、古怪的魔法师。这种熟悉意味着许多人很快就能接受新的枞树人，尽管最初会有一些惊讶。",
	"Since firbolgs are neither prone to travel nor native to the Menagerie Coast, their numbers along Wildemount's western shores are vanishingly small. The people of the Clovis Concord share the same folk tales of giant-like humanoid firbolgs as the folk of the Dwendalian Empire, and are likewise surprised by their gentle nature when they meet them.": "由于枞树既不容易旅行，也不原产于Menagerie海岸，它们在Wildemount西海岸的数量少得令人发指。克洛维斯康科德的人与德文达利安帝国的人一样，对巨人般的人形枞树有着同样的民间传说，当他们遇到枞树时，同样会对它们的温和性质感到惊讶。",
	"Firbolgs who travel southeast from the Greying Wildlands and cross the Dunrock Mountains might find themselves wandering the wastes of Xhorhas. The territorial monsters that prowl the wastes show no pity to unprepared wanderers, and most firbolg families know better than to undertake such a dangerous journey.": "枞树人从格雷英荒原向东南旅行，越过敦罗克山脉，可能会发现自己在Xhorhas的荒原上徘徊。在荒原上游荡的领地怪物对毫无准备的流浪者毫无怜悯之心，大多数枞树家族知道最好不要进行如此危险的旅行。",
	"With northern Xhorhas firmly under the control of the Kryn Dynasty, the dark elves have saved a number of firbolg travelers from monsters over the years. Enough of those have remained in the wastes for small firbolg communities to develop in Rosohna and other major Kryn cities.": "随着Xhorhas北部被Kryn王朝牢牢控制，黑暗精灵们多年来从怪物手中拯救了许多枞树旅行者。这些人中有足够多的人留在荒原上，以便在罗索纳和其他主要的克里恩城市发展小型的枞树社区。",
	"Most firbolgs are druids, rangers, or fighters. Among their kind, these vocations are passed down from one generation to the next. The firbolgs' magical heritage also expresses itself in other ways; those who become bards preserve the clan's lore, and firbolg sorcerers defend their communities. Firbolg wizards arise when a clan becomes friendly with elves.": "大多数枞树人是德鲁伊、游侠或战士。在他们的同类中，这些职业是代代相传的。菲尔博格人的魔法遗产也以其他方式表现出来；那些成为吟游诗人的人保存着氏族的传说，而菲尔博格的巫师则保卫着他们的社区。当一个部族与精灵友好相处时，就会出现菲尔波尔格巫师。",
	"Firbolg rogues are typically scouts tasked with spying on neighboring folk to determine their intentions. They are most common among firbolgs whose homes border human settlements.": "枞树流氓通常是侦察兵，他们的任务是监视附近的居民以确定他们的意图。他们在家园与人类居住区相邻的枞树人中最为常见。",
	"Firbolg barbarians are rare except among clans that face constant threats from evil humanoids and other invaders.": "除了在面临邪恶的人形生物和其他入侵者的持续威胁的部族中，菲尔波尔格野蛮人是罕见的。",
	"Firbolg clerics and paladins are usually dedicated to nature gods, enforcing their will.": "菲尔博格的牧师和圣骑士通常致力于自然神，执行他们的意志。",
	"Firbolg warlocks are rare, but some clans forge alliances and arcane pacts with powerful fey beings.": "枞树族的术士很罕见，但有些部族与强大的费伊人结成联盟并签订了奥术契约。",
	"Firbolg monks are almost entirely unheard of, though a monastery might take in the young survivors of a devastated firbolg clan.": "枞树和尚几乎是闻所未闻的，尽管一个寺院可能会收留一个遭到破坏的枞树部族的年轻幸存者。",
	"Genasi are exceedingly rare on Exandria, as befits their unique origins. Most live among the elementally attuned Ashari tribes of Tal'Dorei or on the Elemental Planes. However, there are no major rifts to the Elemental Planes in Wildemount, and thus no Ashari to safeguard them. The few genasi who dwell on this continent are often created as the result of a powerful elemental influence at the moment of their birth. A baby born within the eye of a hurricane might become an air genasi, while a fire genasi might be born in the midst of a raging forest fire.": "基纳西人在埃克桑德里亚极为罕见，这与他们独特的出身相称。大多数人生活在塔尔多雷（Tal'Dorei）的元素调和的阿沙里（Ashari）部落中，或者生活在元素星球上。然而，在荒野山庄没有通往元素界的主要裂缝，因此也没有阿沙里人来保护它们。居住在这片大陆上的少数基因人，往往是在出生的那一刻就被强大的元素影响所创造。一个出生在飓风之眼的婴儿可能会成为一个空气精灵，而一个火精灵可能出生在熊熊的森林大火之中。",
	"Some genasi are more attuned to their native element than others. A genasi with a powerful connection to elemental fire might have their head covered by crackling flames rather than hair. A genasi with a connection to elemental water might have blue-tinged skin and appear to sweat profusely at all times.": "有些基因人比其他基因人更适应他们的本土元素。一个与火元素有强大联系的精灵可能会用噼里啪啦的火焰而不是头发覆盖他们的头部。与水元素有联系的玄武者可能会有蓝色的皮肤，并在任何时候都显得汗流浃背。",
	"Genasi are so visually distinctive and uncommon that they are treated with equal amounts of surprise and wonder in all the nations of Wildemount. The authoritarian regime of the Dwendalian Empire reacts the most harshly to the unique power of genasi, and the Cerberus Assembly takes the greatest interest in them. Genasi are often press-ganged into joining the assembly under threat of death or exile, and most accept the offer. Those who refuse—and who survive—often take refuge in the empire's criminal underworld, with many finding acceptance in the Myriad crime syndicate.": "基纳西在视觉上是如此的独特和不寻常，以至于他们在荒野之城的所有国家中都受到同等程度的惊讶和惊叹。Dwendalian帝国的独裁政权对基因人的独特力量反应最激烈，而Cerberus议会对他们的兴趣最大。基那斯人经常在死亡或流放的威胁下被强迫加入议会，而大多数人都接受了这个提议。那些拒绝加入的人--以及那些幸存下来的人--通常会在帝国的黑社会犯罪组织中避难，其中许多人在Myriad犯罪集团中找到了归宿。",
	"Even the cosmopolitan people of the Clovis Concord react to the sight of a genasi with wonder. Sailors and pirates alike take special interest in genasi, for the power to harness the elements is a gift from the gods on the open sea.": "即使是Clovis Concord的国际大都市的人们，看到genasi也会感到惊讶。水手和海盗都对genasi特别感兴趣，因为驾驭元素的能力是公海上众神的礼物。",
	"Powerful storms wrack the flat plains of Xhorhas, and many who live beyond the walls of the Kryn Dynasty's cities pray to Kord the Storm Lord to win blessings and protection from his wrath. Air, fire, and water genasi are often born under Kord's auspices, and many become shamans serving the folk of Xhorhas. Few earth genasi roam the wastes, though some are said to dwell within the Vermaloc Wildwood.": "强大的风暴肆虐着Xhorhas的平坦平原，许多生活在Kryn王朝城墙外的人向风暴之神Kord祈祷，以赢得祝福和保护，免受其愤怒的影响。空气、火和水精灵通常在科德的庇护下出生，许多人成为服务于Xhorhas人民的巫师。很少有土系精灵在荒原上游荡，不过据说有些精灵居住在维摩罗克野林中。",
	"The Kryn know little about the genasi and are eager to rectify that. Their scouts have orders to bring back any genasi they encounter to Rosohna.": "克林人对基因人知之甚少，并急于纠正这种情况。他们的侦察员奉命将他们遇到的任何基因人带回罗索纳。",
	"A genasi character has the following racial traits.": "玄学人物具有以下种族特征。",
	"Gnomes are not native to Wildemount, and are relatively uncommon even in an age of swift boats from Marquet and flying airships from Tal'Dorei. They hail from the distant continent of Issylra and were largely content to remain there after the Calamity. In lands inhabited by people taller and stronger than them, gnomes often resort to living exclusively among other gnomes for their own security. This attitude has kept the gnomes of Wildemount safe for generations, but it has also instilled many gnomish societies with a pernicious strain of xenophobia.": "侏儒并不是荒野山庄的原住民，即使在马尔凯特的快船和塔尔多雷的飞艇时代，也是比较少见的。他们来自遥远的伊塞拉大陆，在灾难发生后基本满足于留在那里。在比他们高大强壮的人所居住的土地上，地精常常为了自己的安全而专门生活在其他地精中。这种态度使荒野山庄的地精们世代安全，但也给许多地精社会灌输了有害的排外情绪。",
	"Two major gnome ethnic groups exist within the Dwendalian Empire, one centered in the mountain-city of Hupperdook and the other in the wooded Velvin Thicket. The rock gnomes of Hupperdook originally settled the Silberquel Ridge, and formed their enclave as a defense against bandits and brigands who hunted their kind for sport. This settlement predated the rise of the empire, and after a long and unprecedented period of imperial diplomacy—rather than conquest—the Hupperdook gnomes were finally convinced to add their cultural knack for invention to the empire's might.": "在德文达里亚帝国有两个主要的地精族群，一个以山城Hupperdook为中心，另一个则在树木茂盛的Velvin Thicket。胡珀杜克的岩石地精最初定居在西尔伯克尔山脊，并形成了他们的飞地，以抵御以猎杀他们为乐的强盗和土匪。这个定居点早于帝国的兴起，经过长期的、前所未有的帝国外交--而不是征服--胡珀杜克地精终于被说服，将他们的文化发明诀窍加入帝国的力量。",
	"The forest gnomes of the Velvin Thicket have resisted imperial takeover for decades. As a result, though most people in the empire see gnomes as their loyal friends and allies, many folk in the empire's western reaches view gnomes as obstinate, backcountry hicks.": "维尔文丛林的森林地精几十年来一直在抵制帝国的接管。因此，尽管帝国的大多数人将地精视为他们忠诚的朋友和盟友，但帝国西部地区的许多人将地精视为顽固的、落后的乡下人。",
	"Large numbers of gnomes live within the Clovis Concord, primarily in the city of Gwardan, where a group of gnomes who seceded from Hupperdook settled before the Concord's founding. Just as the elves of Gwardan were the metaphorical architects of the original concordance that founded the nation of city-states, the gnomes of Gwardan were the literal architects of the Clovis Concord's magnificent cities and halls of governance. A rock gnome by the name of Ionia Marbleweaver is revered as the grandmother of Concordian art and architecture for her innovative use of columns, frescoes, and friezes, all of which feature prominently in the great buildings of the Menagerie Coast's cities.": "大量的地精生活在Clovis协约中，主要是在Gwardan市，在协约成立之前，一群从Hupperdook分离出来的地精在这里定居。就像格瓦丹的精灵是建立城邦国家的原始协约的隐喻建筑师一样，格瓦丹的地精是克洛维斯协约的宏伟城市和管理大厅的字面建筑师。一个名叫艾欧尼亚-大理石编织者的岩石地精被尊称为康科迪亚艺术和建筑的祖母，因为她创新地使用了柱子、壁画和门楣，所有这些都在Menagerie海岸城市的伟大建筑中占据了突出位置。",
	"Most Xhorhasians' only contact with gnomes is a brief glimpse of a deep gnome scurrying about the Underdark carrying armfuls of gems. The deep gnomes have little interest in surface politics, and even try to stay neutral in the underground war between the Kryn Dynasty and the duergar rebels. For the most part, the deep gnomes and their settlements are small enough to remain unnoticed by larger folk.": "大多数Xhorhasians与地精的唯一接触是短暂地瞥见一个深层地精携带着一臂的宝石在地下世界里窜来窜去。深层地精对地表政治兴趣不大，甚至试图在克莱恩王朝和杜尔加叛军之间的地下战争中保持中立。在大多数情况下，深层地精和他们的定居点足够小，不会被更多的人注意到。",
	"The civilized people of the world consider goblins to be nothing more than monsters—and in many ways, they're right. Goblins and their cousins, the hobgoblins and bugbears, were first created by Bane, the Strife Emperor, as foot soldiers for his unholy army. Eons ago, when the flames of the Calamity burned across Exandria, the Betrayer Gods gathered in the realm that would eventually become Xhorhas. There, they found a people known as the dranassar. An ancestor race to the goblinoids, the dranassar were tall and beautiful, strong of body and mind, and fleet of foot. Their hair was thick and black, and their skin gleamed like gold. Most of the dranassar willingly served the divine beings that descended upon their land, but a few fought back against the Betrayer Gods' rule.": "世界上的文明人认为妖精不过是怪物--在许多方面，他们是对的。妖精和它们的表亲--霍布林和虫熊，最初是由纷争皇帝贝恩创造的，作为他的邪恶军队的步兵。几百年前，当灾难的火焰烧遍埃克桑德里亚时，背叛者诸神聚集在最终成为Xhorhas的领域。在那里，他们发现了一个被称为德拉纳萨的民族。作为地精的祖先种族，德拉纳萨人高大而美丽，身体和头脑都很强壮，而且脚步轻快。他们的头发浓密而乌黑，皮肤像黄金一样闪闪发光。大多数德拉纳萨人愿意为降临在他们土地上的神灵服务，但也有少数人反抗背叛者诸神的统治。",
	"Bane, a cruel tyrant even among the Betrayer Gods, smote the rebellious dranassar and twisted them into the goblinkin. When the armies of the Betrayer Gods wanted for skirmishers, Bane twisted the dranassar into goblins. When he was in need of loyal soldiers, he made them into hobgoblins. And when brute force was required, he sculpted them into bugbears. As the war of gods and mortals raged on, Bane corrupted even those dranassar who remained loyal to him.": "贝恩，即使在背叛者诸神中也是一个残酷的暴君，他击溃了反叛的德拉纳萨，并将他们扭曲成了哥布林金。当背叛者之神的军队需要小兵时，贝恩将德拉纳萨人扭曲成了妖精。当他需要忠诚的士兵时，他把他们变成了霍布格林。而当需要蛮力的时候，他把他们塑造成了虫熊。随着神与凡人的战争不断进行，贝恩甚至腐蚀了那些仍然忠于他的德拉纳萨人。",
	"The Betrayer Gods are long since defeated, but the goblinkin survived—leaderless, lost, and fallen into chaos. It is said that the voice of Bane still whispers into the minds of the goblinkin, goading them to commit senseless acts of cruelty against all they see.": "背叛者之神早已被击败，但戈布林肯人幸存了下来，他们没有领导，迷失了方向，陷入了混乱。据说贝恩的声音仍在戈布林肯人的脑海中低语，诱使他们对他们所看到的一切进行无意义的残忍行为。",
	"Few goblins can steel their will against Bane's foul whispers, but those who do live peaceful lives free of the god's influence. Likewise, people who are transfigured into goblins or reborn as goblins do not hear the voice of Bane, and are free from his curse of strife.": "很少有地精能以自己的意志对抗班恩的污秽低语，但那些能做到的人都过着和平的生活，不受神的影响。同样地，被转化为妖精或重生为妖精的人也不会听到贝恩的声音，并从他的纷争诅咒中解脱。",
	"With most goblins in the empire tormented by Bane's homicidal whispers, the people of the empire are just as fearful of goblinkin as the goblins are of them. Farmers and folk in rural regions such as the southern Marrow Valley take special precautions against goblin raids, and kill goblins on sight as if they were marauding animals. Even goblins who manage to free themselves of Bane's influence are hard-pressed to overcome the fears of the empire's rural folk. By contrast, city dwellers are rarely exposed to goblin raiders, and though they might react with suspicion and fear when seeing a goblin on the street, most are more accepting of the notion that not all goblins are evil.": "由于帝国的大多数妖精都被贝恩杀人的低语所折磨，帝国的人民对妖精的恐惧就像妖精对他们一样。农村地区的农民和民众，如南部的马罗河谷，对妖精的突袭采取了特别的预防措施，并像对待掠夺的动物一样当场杀死妖精。即使是那些设法摆脱贝恩影响的妖精也很难克服帝国农村居民的恐惧。相比之下，城市居民很少接触到哥布林突袭者，尽管他们在街上看到哥布林时可能会有怀疑和恐惧的反应，但大多数人更能接受并非所有的哥布林都是邪恶的这个概念。",
	"Goblins are a rare sight on the Menagerie Coast, so most folk who live there know of them only through folklore and stories told by travelers. With visitors from the Dwendalian Empire, the realms of Tal'Dorei, and Marquet common on the coast, most of those stories are tales of the vicious goblins of the Ravager horde of Tal'Dorei or the fearsome Duneburrow goblins of the far-off Marquesian deserts, painting a deeply unwholesome picture of goblinkin.": "妖精在Menagerie海岸是一种罕见的景象，所以生活在那里的大多数人只通过民间传说和旅行者讲述的故事知道它们。来自德文达里帝国、塔尔多雷王国和马尔凯特的游客在海岸上很常见，这些故事大多是关于塔尔多雷的Ravager部落的邪恶妖精或遥远的马尔凯特沙漠中可怕的Duneburrow妖精的故事，描绘了一幅极不健康的哥布林克的画面。",
	"People living along the northern Menagerie Coast, in cities such as Gwardan, have firsthand accounts of the goblins and bugbears who have recently settled in the Lushgut Forest. Those who worship the Wild Mother in Gwardan have long seen the forest as one of her most sacred places, and initially reacted with fear to the forest's \"monstrous invaders.\" But with the bugbears and goblins having freed themselves of Bane's corrupting influence through druidic meditation, they are slowly fostering friendship with the people of Gwardan.": "生活在Menagerie海岸北部，如Gwardan等城市的人们有关于最近定居在Lushgut森林的妖精和虫熊的第一手资料。那些在格沃丹崇拜野性之母的人长期以来一直将森林视为她最神圣的地方之一，并且最初对森林的 \"可怕的入侵者 \"做出了恐惧反应。但随着虫人和地精通过德鲁伊的冥想摆脱了贝恩的腐蚀影响，他们慢慢地与格瓦丹的人们建立起了友谊。",
	"The term \"goblinkin\" refers to three types of related peoples: goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears. All three are affected by Bane's curse of strife, allowing his foul voice to prey upon their minds from beyond the Divine Gate. Goblinkin who manage to overcome Bane's curse are freed from the compulsion that leads them to evil. Unless the goblinkin was freed near birth, however, they have likely internalized their bias toward law, chaos, or neutrality, and might retain that aspect of their alignment even after the curse is broken.": "goblinkin \"这个词指的是三种相关的民族：地精、霍布格林和虫族。所有这三种人都受到贝恩的纷争诅咒的影响，让他肮脏的声音从神门之外掠夺他们的思想。能够克服班恩的诅咒的哥布林肯人，会从导致他们走向邪恶的蛊惑中得到解脱。然而，除非戈布林肯人在出生时就被释放，否则他们很可能已经内化为对法律、混乱或中立的偏见，甚至在诅咒被打破后还可能保留这方面的取向。",
	"It is nearly impossible for a goblinkin to break Bane's curse on their own. Only those who undergo particularly traumatic events or are shown exceptional compassion typically find the inner strength to do so. Whenever a goblinkin returns to consciousness after being reduced to 0 hit points, they can make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if they were brought back to life. On a success, the goblinkin breaks free from the curse of strife. A goblinkin targeted by {@spell remove curse} can also make this saving throw, with advantage on the save if the caster is a trusted companion.": "戈布林肯人几乎不可能靠自己的力量打破贝恩的诅咒。只有那些经历了特别痛苦的事件或被展示出特别的同情心的人才能找到内在的力量来这样做。每当一个妖精在被降低到0命中率后恢复意识时，他们可以做一个DC20的智慧救赎，如果他们是被救活的，则有优势。如果成功，该妖精就会从纷争的诅咒中挣脱出来。被{@spell remove curse}瞄准的妖精也可以做这个蓄力动作，如果施法者是一个值得信赖的同伴，则在蓄力上有优势。",
	"Many bugbears are cleansed of the curse from birth by a druidic order of bugbears who managed to break free from Bane's influence decades ago. These bugbears never develop a chaotic, isolationist nature, and readily band together with druids and other defenders of the wilderness.": "许多虫族从出生起就被德鲁伊教团洗净了诅咒，他们在几十年前就设法摆脱了班恩的影响。这些虫人从未发展出混乱的、孤立的本性，并且很容易与德鲁伊和其他荒野的保卫者联合起来。",
	"Goblins who suffer from the curse of strife are typically neutral evil, goaded by Bane to commit acts of wanton destruction and malice among the folk of the mortal races that opposed him in the Calamity. Hobgoblins afflicted by the curse of strife are almost exclusively lawful evil, and are urged toward acts of conquest. Their societies are regimented like military dictatorships, and hobgoblin despots are the scourges of whole nations. Bugbears who suffer under Bane's influence are typically chaotic evil, and are commanded to isolate themselves from all bonds and ties of camaraderie so as to maximize the suffering of those they brutalize.": "遭受纷争诅咒的地精是典型的中性邪恶，被贝恩怂恿着在灾难中反对他的凡人种族中进行肆意的破坏和恶意的行为。受纷争之咒影响的霍布林几乎都是合法的邪恶，并被怂恿着进行征服行为。他们的社会就像军事独裁政权一样团团转，而妖精暴君则是整个国家的祸害。受贝恩影响的虫人是典型的混沌邪恶，他们被命令与所有的纽带和友情联系隔离开来，以最大限度地减轻他们所残害的人的痛苦。",
	"Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears are a common sight in Xhorhas, especially around Rosohna—for it was here that Bane first created the goblinkin from the noble dranassar. The people of the Kryn Dynasty have made efforts to forge close ties with the goblinkin who have made their home in the region, and have even managed to subvert the curse of strife by the power of the Luxon. Any creature reborn into a goblinkin body is born without the curse, and any natural-born goblin born within one hundred miles of a {@item Luxon beacon|EGW} is likewise shielded from Bane's seed of corruption.": "哥布林、霍布林和虫族是Xhorhas的常见现象，尤其是在Rosohna周围--因为正是在这里，贝恩首次从高贵的德拉纳萨创造了哥布林。克林王朝的人民努力与在该地区安家的goblinkin建立密切联系，甚至设法通过卢克逊的力量颠覆了纷争的诅咒。任何重生到妖精身体里的生物都不会受到诅咒的影响，任何出生在{@item Luxon beacon|EGW}一百英里范围内的天生妖精也同样不会受到贝恩的腐败种子的影响。",
	"A hobgoblin character has the following racial traits.": "一个地精角色具有以下种族特征。",
	"The {@race goliath|vgm|goliaths} of Exandria are a mighty people with stone giant blood running in their veins. Most stand well over seven feet tall and are blessed with a naturally powerful physique. Like their stone giant progenitors, goliaths are a rare sight in Wildemount. Most live on isolated peaks in the Cyrios Mountains, the Penumbra Range, and on the isolated land of Eiselcross. Those few goliaths who are exiled from their herds and wander into more densely peopled lands are uniformly greeted with fear and confusion.": "艾克桑德里亚的{@race goliath|vgm|goliaths}人是一个强大的民族，他们的血管里流淌着石巨人的血液。他们大多身高超过7英尺，拥有天生的强大体魄。就像他们的石巨人祖先一样，歌利亚人在荒野山庄是很少见的。大多数人生活在赛里奥斯山脉的孤立的山峰上，潘恩布拉山脉，以及艾瑟克罗斯的孤立的土地上。那些被放逐的少数歌利亚人，如果闯入人口更稠密的土地，都会受到恐惧和困惑的欢迎。",
	"Goliaths have a compulsion to compete and keep score, counting their deeds and tallying their accomplishments to compare to others. Goliaths love to win, but they see defeat as a prod to improve their skills. Above all else, they are driven to outdo their past efforts. Few goliaths reach old age, as most die attempting to surpass their past achievements.": "歌利亚人有一种竞争和记分的强迫症，他们计算自己的事迹，统计自己的成就，以便与他人比较。高利贷者喜欢赢，但他们把失败看作是对他们技能提高的一种鞭策。最重要的是，他们被驱动着去超越他们过去的努力。很少有歌利亚人到达老年，因为大多数人都是为了超越他们过去的成就而死去。",
	"Among goliaths, any adult who can't or won't contribute to the herd is expelled. A lone goliath has little chance of survival, especially an older or weaker one. Goliaths have little pity for adults who can't take care of themselves, though a sick or injured individual is treated, as a result of the goliath concept of fair play.": "在巨人中，任何不能或不愿意为族群做出贡献的成年人都会被驱逐。孤独的歌利亚人几乎没有生存的机会，尤其是年长或弱小的歌利亚人。哥利亚人对不能照顾自己的成年人几乎没有怜悯之心，尽管生病或受伤的人会得到治疗，这是哥利亚人公平竞争观念的结果。",
	"Half-elves occupy all lands where humans and elves gather. In ancient times, the appearance of half-elves was a cause for alarm in elven society, for prejudiced elves saw the union between elves and humans as a symptom of impurity in their blood and culture. Such attitudes have cooled across the continent in recent centuries, and most elven societies now feature a diverse array of people—notably the pluralistic union of dwarves and elves in the city-state of Uthodurn and the diverse peoples of the Kryn Dynasty.": "半精灵占据了人类和精灵聚集的所有土地。在古代，半精灵的出现在精灵社会中引起了恐慌，因为有偏见的精灵认为精灵和人类的结合是他们血液和文化不纯的症状。近几个世纪以来，这样的态度在整个大陆已经降温，大多数精灵社会现在都有不同的人，特别是乌索杜恩城邦的矮人和精灵的多元结合，以及克里恩王朝的不同民族。",
	"The Dwendalian Empire sees half-elves as a sign that imperial rule is healthy, and that people are traveling across and strengthening the bonds of its disparate provinces. However, this belief is less pervasive in the elven enclave of Bysaes Tyl, which was coerced into joining the empire decades ago. The elves of Bysaes Tyl are dedicated to maintaining a tenuous grasp on their lost realm of Molaesmyr, and any elf who bears a non-elf child is considered a traitor to their ancient culture.": "德文达尔帝国认为半身人是帝国统治健康的标志，人们正在穿越并加强其不同省份之间的联系。然而，这种信念在精灵飞地Bysaes Tyl并不普遍，它在几十年前被胁迫加入帝国。Bysaes Tyl的精灵们致力于维持对他们失去的Molaesmyr王国的脆弱控制，任何生下非精灵孩子的精灵都被认为是他们古老文化的叛徒。",
	"In some ways, the Clovis Concord can be considered a half-elf nation, founded as it was by the native human Ki'Nau people and by elf and human settlers from Marquet. Half-elves are also a common sight arriving on passenger ships from Tal'Dorei. The elves of Syngorn, the center of elven culture in Tal'Dorei, still hold a shameful and outdated view of their half-elf children, many of whom seek passage or stow away on ships to the Menagerie Coast to start new lives.": "在某些方面，Clovis Concord可以被认为是一个半精灵国家，因为它是由本地人类Ki'Nau人和来自Marquet的精灵和人类定居者建立的。半精灵也是乘坐客船从塔尔多雷抵达的常见景象。辛戈恩的精灵是塔尔多雷的精灵文化中心，他们对自己的半精灵孩子仍然持有可耻和过时的看法，其中许多人寻求通过或偷渡到巨兽海岸，开始新的生活。",
	"Half-elves of all different ancestries dwell within the lands of the Kryn, with most having one dark elf parent. The idea of elves forming relationships and even having children with people of other humanoid races has long since been accepted throughout Kryn lands—so much so that it seems somewhat unnatural when people outside the culture express surprise at half-elves with small, minotaur-like horns, or with the tufted ears and yellow eyes of a bugbear.": "所有不同血统的半精灵都居住在克里恩的土地上，其中大多数人的父母都是黑暗精灵。精灵与其他人形种族的人建立关系甚至生孩子的想法早已被整个克里恩大陆所接受--以至于当文化以外的人对长着牛头人一样的小角，或者长着虫子一样的簇状耳朵和黄色眼睛的半精灵表示惊讶时，这似乎有点不自然。",
	"In ancient times, {@race kenku|vgm} were black-winged angels—ambassadors who served the Raven Queen as her emissaries of death. Their voices were once heard across entire planes, calling the dead to the Raven Queen's embrace. The kenku likewise served as her loyal warriors in the Calamity, and even saved her from a near-fatal encounter with the Betrayer God known as Tharizdun.": "在古代，{@race kenku|vgm}是黑翼天使--作为乌鸦女王的死亡使者为其服务的使者。他们的声音曾经在整个星球上被听到，召唤死人到乌鸦女王的怀抱。在灾难中，肯库同样作为她忠诚的战士，甚至在与被称为塔里兹顿的背叛者神的近乎致命的遭遇中拯救了她。",
	"Though the kenku saved the Raven Queen from oblivion, all of her black-winged emissaries were consumed by Tharizdun's infinite void. For long years, the kenku were thought to have been annihilated, and it was only when Tharizdun was defeated and chained by the god Ioun near the Calamity's end that they were freed.": "虽然Kenku将乌鸦女王从遗忘中拯救出来，但她所有的黑翼使者都被Tharizdun的无尽虚空所吞噬。漫长的岁月里，肯库人被认为已经被消灭了，只有当塔里兹敦在灾难结束前被伊昂神击败并拴住时，他们才被释放。",
	"When the gods sealed themselves behind the Divine Gate, the Raven Queen realized what her emissaries had sacrificed to save her. Though the kenku survived oblivion, they returned as mortals, stripped of all the divine gifts their god had bestowed on them: their voices, their wings, and all memories of their past existence. Bearing Tharizdun's curse of oblivion, the kenku were reduced to squat beings that could speak only by mimicking the words of others.": "当众神将自己封在神门之后，乌鸦女王意识到她的使者为拯救她所做的牺牲。虽然Kenku在遗忘中幸存下来，但他们回到了凡人的世界，被剥夺了他们的神赋予他们的所有神圣的礼物：他们的声音、他们的翅膀，以及他们过去存在的所有记忆。背负着塔里兹敦的遗忘诅咒，肯库变成了只能通过模仿别人的话语来说话的矮小生命。",
	"Kenku exist across Wildemount in small numbers. Considered by most to be monsters, they keep to themselves as a result, always longing for something they can neither ask for nor explain. Something in a kenku's mind stirs when it looks to the sky and see birds flying freely—an ancient longing, and a memory trapped within oblivion.": "Kenku在整个Wildemount存在，数量不多。他们被大多数人认为是怪物，因此他们独来独往，总是渴望着一些他们无法要求也无法解释的东西。当Kenku看到天空中自由飞翔的鸟儿时，他们心中的某些东西就会蠢蠢欲动--这是一种古老的渴望，也是一种被困在遗忘中的记忆。",
	"The first half-orcs in Wildemount were born of a union between human warriors and orc traitors in the final days of the Calamity. Orcs are one of Exandria's youngest races, and are said to have been born from elves seared by the blood of Gruumsh, the Ruiner, when Corellon pierced the orc god's eye on the field of battle. For long years, orcs were feared as mindless abominations, drawn to slaughter like moths to flame.": "荒野山庄的第一批半兽人是由人类战士和兽人叛徒在灾变的最后日子里结合而成的。兽人是艾克珊德里亚最年轻的种族之一，据说是由被毁灭者格鲁姆什的血液灼伤的精灵诞生的，当时科瑞隆在战场上刺穿了兽人之神的眼睛。长久以来，兽人被视为无意识的憎恶，像飞蛾扑火一样被吸引到屠杀中。",
	"Orcs and half-orcs do feel a certain pull toward violence and anger. But the simple truth is that there is no curse of ruin. No supernatural power drives orcs to kill. Rather, they are simply victims of the same selfish, violent impulses that corrupt all mortal beings.": "兽人和半兽人确实对暴力和愤怒有一定的吸引力。但简单的事实是，并不存在毁灭的诅咒。没有超自然的力量驱使兽人去杀人。相反，他们只是同样的自私、暴力冲动的受害者，这些冲动腐蚀了所有的凡人。",
	"The orcish settlement of Bladegarden was incorporated into the Dwendalian Empire after the fall of the Julous Dominion, nearly three hundred years ago. Orcs are now renowned as some of the empire's most accomplished soldiers, though many folk still fear the ancient legends of the curse of ruin.": "兽人定居点Bladegarden在近三百年前朱鲁斯统治区灭亡后被并入德文达里亚帝国。兽人现在被誉为帝国最出色的士兵，尽管许多人仍然害怕毁灭的诅咒的古老传说。",
	"Half-orcs are proud of their heritage, though many are wary of the wrathful curse that supposedly drives them to violence. Those who embrace this gift of fury often enlist in the Righteous Brand to focus their rage against the enemies of the empire. Other half-orcs reject the idea that they are destined for violence, and rely on faith, meditation, and friendship to live peaceful lives.": "半兽人以他们的遗产为荣，尽管许多人对据说会驱使他们走向暴力的愤怒诅咒很警惕。那些接受这种愤怒天赋的人经常加入 \"正义牌\"，以集中他们的怒火来对付帝国的敌人。其他半兽人拒绝接受他们注定要从事暴力的想法，而是依靠信仰、冥想和友谊来过上和平的生活。",
	"The folk of the Clovis Concord welcome people of all kinds to their shores, yet orcs and half-orcs are uncommon in Concordian cities. Most half-orcs on the Menagerie Coast come from the continent of Tal'Dorei as visitors, merchants, or mercenaries, and rarely settle. Half-orc children in the settlements of the coast are often bullied for their unusual teeth.": "克洛维斯康科德的人们欢迎各种类型的人来到他们的海岸，然而兽人和半兽人在康科德的城市中并不常见。巨兽海岸的大多数半兽人来自塔尔多雷大陆，是游客、商人或雇佣兵，很少定居。半兽人的孩子在海岸的定居点经常因为他们不寻常的牙齿而被欺负。",
	"Only the Concordian city of Othe has a significant half-orc population. Originally established as a spiritual site for the Ki'Nau people, the city has long attracted orcs and half-orcs who believe that the curse of ruin has caused them to lash out at those they love. In Othe, they find peace through spiritualism—and a place to belong.": "只有康科迪亚的奥瑟城有大量的半兽人人口。这座城市最初是作为基诺人的精神家园而建立的，长期以来吸引着兽人和半兽人，他们相信毁灭的诅咒使他们向自己所爱的人发泄。在奥瑟，他们通过灵修找到了和平--以及一个归属的地方。",
	"The orcs of Xhorhas are a predominantly nomadic people, living in mixed clans of orcs, humans, and bugbears. They wander the wastes, taming the indigenous beasts and trading with Kryn settlements. The relationship between the orcs and the Kryn is relatively peaceful, though many nomadic orcs are angered when Kryn souls are reborn in orc bodies. These orcs nonetheless readily accept Kryn into their roving clans, seeing it as a point of pride that a city dweller has been drawn to a more exciting life in the chaos of the wastes.": "霍哈斯的兽人是一个以游牧为主的民族，生活在兽人、人类和虫族的混合部族中。他们在荒原上游荡，驯服当地的野兽并与克莱恩定居点进行贸易。兽人和克莱恩之间的关系相对和平，尽管当克莱恩的灵魂在兽人身体中重生时，许多游牧兽人感到愤怒。但这些兽人还是很乐意接受克莱恩加入他们的游牧部族，他们认为一个城市居民被吸引到混乱的荒野中过上更刺激的生活是一件值得骄傲的事。",
	"Most half-orcs in Xhorhas have human or drow blood. In the culture of the Xhorhasian nomads, the union of orcs and goblinkin is strictly taboo, for the clans' elders fear the uncontrolled madness of a soul afflicted by both Gruumsh's curse of ruin and Bane's curse of strife.": "Xhorhas的大多数半兽人都有人类或乌鸦血统。在Xhhorhasian游牧民族的文化中，兽人和哥布林肯人的结合是严格的禁忌，因为氏族的长老们害怕受到格鲁姆什的毁灭诅咒和贝恩的争斗诅咒影响的灵魂不受控制的疯狂。",
	"Exandrian orcs are not bound to commit acts of evil by nature. See the races page for the racial traits of an {@race orc|egw} character.": "艾桑德里亚兽人并不是天生就注定要从事邪恶的行为。关于{@race orc|egw}角色的种族特征，请参见种族页面。",
	"Tabaxi can be found in small numbers throughout Wildemount and are generally well thought of. Some make up small clans in the wilderness beyond the boundaries of Wildemount's major societies. Others are content to stand out among the other folk of those larger nations. Deft at crafts, hunting, and commercial enterprises, many tabaxi find themselves drawn toward an entrepreneurial existence, while some fall naturally into the more dangerous pursuits of an adventurer's lifestyle.": "Tabaxi在整个Wildemount都能找到少量的人，他们一般都很受人尊敬。有些人在荒野的主要社会边界之外的荒野上组成了小部族。其他人则满足于在那些大国的其他民俗中脱颖而出。许多塔巴西人擅长手工艺、狩猎和商业活动，他们发现自己被吸引到了一个企业家的生活中，而有些人则自然而然地陷入了冒险家生活方式的更危险的追求中。",
	"Politics hold a conversational curiosity for some, but only a few tabaxi are driven enough to ascend to positions of political power, most commonly along the Menagerie Coast. Even so, most catfolk are happier away from the limelight, slyly convincing others to visibly take the risks for them.": "政治对一些人来说是一种谈话的好奇心，但只有少数Tabaxi有足够的动力登上政治权力的位置，在Menagerie海岸最常见。即便如此，大多数猫人还是更乐于远离风头，狡猾地说服别人为他们承担风险。",
	"Centuries have passed since the tieflings first faced persecution for their fiendish heritage in the Age of Arcanum. Although a certain mystique still surrounds their kind, most people in Wildemount grew up alongside tieflings, and the tides of war have brought tiefling soldiers, merchants, and entertainers into even the most rural and isolated regions of the continent. For the most part, only overzealously devout paladins and folk raised on the dark tales of an ancient age might actively wish harm on tieflings.": "自从铁皮人在阿卡纳姆时代首次因其恶魔般的传统而面临迫害以来，已经过去了几个世纪。尽管某种神秘感仍然围绕着他们的种类，但在Wildemount，大多数人都是在盗贼身边长大的，战争的浪潮将盗贼的士兵、商人和艺人带到了大陆上最偏远的乡村和地区。在大多数情况下，只有过于狂热的虔诚的圣骑士和在古老时代的黑暗故事中长大的人，才会主动希望伤害铁皮人。",
	"Exandrian tieflings have a wide array of skin tones, all of them vibrant and colorful. The most common hue is a deep crimson, but shades of purple, blue, green, and even yellow and pink have been seen throughout the world. It's not known what causes these variations, as even tiefling parents with the same skin tone can have children of wildly different colors.": "埃克桑德兰铁弗林有各种各样的肤色，都是充满活力和色彩的。最常见的色调是深红色，但紫色、蓝色、绿色，甚至黄色和粉色的色调在世界各地都能看到。不知道是什么原因导致了这些变化，因为即使是拥有相同肤色的铁弗林父母，也会有颜色大不相同的孩子。",
	"Most imperial tieflings live in the cities of the empire or in small communes in the countryside. Many are encouraged by their parents to join the Crownsguard or the Righteous Brand to valiantly serve the empire, and a direct connection can be drawn between the tieflings' ancient persecution and their focus on military service. Centuries ago, countless tieflings joined the armies of the Julous Dominion in hopes of winning glory and proving themselves the equals of their oppressors. Over time, many found acceptance in the eyes of the Julous people and its government, eventually becoming hardline loyalists of the Julous Dominion. Their spirits were thus crushed when the dominion fell to the mighty armies of the invading Dwendalian Empire.": "大多数帝国的铁皮人都生活在帝国的城市或乡村的小公社中。许多人在父母的鼓励下加入皇冠卫队或正义之牌，为帝国英勇效力，在铁皮人的古老迫害和他们对军事服务的关注之间可以得出直接的联系。几个世纪以前，无数的铁皮人加入了朱鲁斯统治区的军队，希望能赢得荣耀，证明自己与压迫者是平等的。随着时间的推移，许多人在朱鲁斯人民和政府的眼中找到了认同感，最终成为朱鲁斯统治区的铁杆忠诚者。当统治区被入侵的德文达尔帝国的强大军队攻陷时，他们的精神就这样被击垮了。",
	"Three generations have passed since the fall of the dominion, and many adult tieflings still remember the war stories their grandparents told them as children. The empire's propagandists have been quick to capitalize on this, stoking a hunger for glory that sees the lives of eager tieflings fuel the imperial war machine.": "自统治区沦陷以来，已经过去了三代人，许多成年的铁皮人仍然记得他们的祖父母在孩童时期告诉他们的战争故事。帝国的宣传人员迅速利用了这一点，激起了对荣誉的渴望，看到热切的铁皮人的生命为帝国的战争机器提供了动力。",
	"Tieflings' extravagant skin tones and striking horns are considered attractive in the culture of the Clovis Concord, and many tieflings have capitalized on this reaction to become entertainers. Some of the best-known tiefling actors, gladiators, and musicians found their start on the Menagerie Coast—as have innumerable entertainers of the bawdier sort, including the prominent Nicodranas courtesan known as Ruby of the Sea. Many such performers have gone on to perform at the court of King Bertrand Dwendal, or to tour the distant lands of Tal'Dorei and Marquet.": "在Clovis Concord的文化中，Tieflings奢侈的肤色和引人注目的角被认为是有吸引力的，许多Tieflings利用这种反应成为了艺人。一些最知名的铁皮人演员、角斗士和音乐家都是在Menagerie海岸开始的--无数的艺人也是如此，包括著名的Nicodranas歌妓，被称为 \"海之红宝石\"。许多这样的表演者后来都在贝特朗-德文达尔国王的宫廷里表演，或在遥远的塔尔多雷和马奎特的土地上巡回演出。",
	"Some legends talk of how the first tieflings were born in Ghor Dranas. Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, is said to have tempted a number of that city's original inhabitants into tying their bloodlines to his own infernal power in exchange for magical knowledge. Though the truth of the tale is impossible to confirm, Rosohna maintains a significant tiefling population, and tieflings are a common sight in Kryn society.": "一些传说谈到了第一批盗贼是如何在Ghor Dranas诞生的。九层地狱之主阿斯莫德（Asmodeus），据说引诱了该城市的一些原始居民将他们的血统与他自己的地狱力量联系在一起，以换取魔法知识。虽然这个故事的真实性无法证实，但罗索纳保持着大量的盗贼人口，盗贼在克里恩社会中是一种常见现象。",
	"Tortles are almost unheard of beyond the sunny shores of the Menagerie Coast.": "在摩纳哥海岸的阳光海岸之外，几乎闻所未闻。",
	"The eastern coast of Xhorhas, known to the Kryn as Blightshore, is a land scarred by evil magic. Among the creations of that foul place are the Hollow Ones, beings whose souls have left for the afterlife, yet whose bodies still retain a fragment of their former selves.": "Xhorhas的东海岸，被Kryn称为Blightshore，是一片被邪恶的魔法所伤的土地。在那个肮脏的地方的创造物中，有一个空洞的人，他们的灵魂已经离开了来世，但他们的身体仍然保留着他们以前的碎片。",
	"The magic that sustains Hollow Ones is a mystery. Most Hollow Ones are reborn after dying in Blightshore, suggesting that the spell-scarred nature of the land brought them back for an unknown purpose. Yet some beings find that, days after they died, they awaken, clutching to life, with only a terrible emptiness inside to remind them of their death.": "维持虚空者的魔法是一个谜。大多数虚空者在Blightshore死亡后都会重生，这表明这片土地的法术伤痕使他们为了一个未知的目的而回来。然而，有些生命发现，在他们死后的几天，他们醒来，紧紧抓住生命，只有内心的可怕空虚提醒他们的死亡。",
	"In Blightshore, Hollow Ones are seen as a people like any other. They seem strange, but the adventurous and hardy folk of Blightshore are used to making allies with strange creatures. Elsewhere, Hollow Ones are indistinguishable from living creatures, save for the faint stench of necromancy that lingers about them.": "在Blightshore，虚空者被视为与其他民族一样。他们看起来很奇怪，但是Blightshore的冒险家和坚韧不拔的人民习惯于与奇怪的生物结成盟友。在其他地方，除了萦绕在他们身边的淡淡的亡灵之气外，虚空者与生物没有什么区别。",
	"The transition from life to becoming a Hollow One affects different people to different degrees. Some let their anger and regret consume them. Others use their second chance to become a brighter force in the world. However, all Hollow Ones are marked by their new existence: feelings of unease, dread or sadness cling to them like tattered rags of their past life.": "从生活到成为虚空者的过渡对不同人的影响程度不同。有些人让他们的愤怒和遗憾吞噬了他们。其他人则利用他们的第二次机会，成为世界上更光明的力量。然而，所有的虚空者都被他们的新存在打上了烙印：不安、恐惧或悲伤的感觉就像他们过去生活中的破布一样紧紧缠绕着他们。",
	"This section includes three new subclass options: the Echo Knight for the fighter and Chronurgy Magic and Graviturgy Magic for the wizard.": "本节包括三个新的子类选择：战士的回声骑士和巫师的纪元魔法和重力魔法。",
	"Dunamis is the primal magical energy of potentiality and actuality, an anticipatory arcane force that helps shape the multiverse and might very well be what holds its elements together, like an infinite web of unseen tethers. Manifesting as a translucent gray energy that shimmers and drifts like an ethereal cloud of mist when gathered, dunamis darkens as it vibrates and condenses to the moment of action or invocation, manipulating fundamental aspects of reality. Those who study to control and tap into this near-invisible power can subtly bend the flow of time and space by controlling the forces of localized gravity, peering into possible timelines to shift fate in their favor, and scattering the potential energy of their enemies to rob them of their potency.": "杜纳米斯是潜在性和现实性的原始魔法能量，是一种帮助塑造多元宇宙的预知性奥术力量，很可能是将其元素联系在一起的东西，就像一张看不见的无限的网。表现为一种半透明的灰色能量，在聚集时像空灵的云雾一样闪烁和漂移，当它振动和凝结到行动或召唤的时刻时，dunamis会变暗，操纵着现实的基本方面。那些研究控制和利用这种几乎看不见的力量的人，可以通过控制局部重力的力量来巧妙地弯曲时间和空间的流动，窥视可能的时间线来改变命运对他们有利，并分散敌人的潜在能量来剥夺他们的效力。",
	"Dunamancy is an ancient, esoteric study of magic almost unknown across Exandria. Facets of dunamancy have quietly bled into the more common applications of spellcraft like an unrealized glimpse behind the curtain of creation. Mages who pursue the study of this strange and complex force call themselves dunamancers, and their interest in learning to alter the fabric of gravity, potential, and time often coincides with a hunger to understand the oldest mysteries of the cosmos.": "遁术是一种古老而神秘的魔法研究，在整个艾克桑德里亚几乎无人知晓。地牢术的各个方面已经悄悄地渗入到更常见的法术应用中，就像在创造的幕布后面看到的未实现的一幕。追求研究这种奇怪而复杂的力量的法师们称自己为地下魔法师，他们对学习改变重力、潜能和时间结构的兴趣往往与理解宇宙最古老的奥秘的渴望相吻合。",
	"Although the Kryn Dynasty is responsible for the carefully guarded development and refining of dunamancy, the mysteries of this magical art have long since spread beyond the dynasty's borders. The hidden secrets of harnessing dunamis eventually found their way into the hands of the Cerberus Assembly and have continued to slowly disseminate across all Wildemount as a result.": "虽然克莱恩王朝负责小心翼翼地发展和完善杜纳姆术，但这种神奇艺术的奥秘早已超出了王朝的边界。驾驭杜纳密斯的隐秘最终落入了地狱犬议会的手中，并因此继续在整个荒野山庄慢慢传播着。",
	"If you are considering a character pursuing a path involving the manipulation of dunamis, you can easily tie your story into the Kryn Dynasty and the ready access to dunamancy it provides. But you can also consider where else in the world dunamancy might have spread, and how its secrets have influenced your character's path. You might have stumbled into a cabal of defecting Kryn expatriates who teach you their ways, or you might have been entrusted with learning such secrets as a means of fighting the Kryn with their own power. Work with your Dungeon Master and figure out a fun and logical way that your character and the mysterious power of dunamancy might have crossed paths.": "如果你考虑让一个角色追求一条涉及操纵杜娜米斯的道路，你可以很容易地将你的故事与克莱恩王朝以及它提供的对杜娜米斯的随时访问联系起来。但你也可以考虑，在这个世界上，杜娜玛斯还可能在哪里传播，以及它的秘密是如何影响你的角色的道路的。你可能偶然发现了一个由叛逃的克莱恩侨民组成的小团体，他们向你传授了他们的方法，或者你可能被委托学习这些秘密，作为用他们自己的力量与克莱恩对抗的一种手段。与你的地下城管理员合作，找出一种有趣的、符合逻辑的方式，让你的角色和神秘的地下魔法力量有交集。",
	"In campaigns outside Wildemount, there is no factional control of dunamancy, so the implementation of this arcane discipline is entirely open. Talk to your Dungeon Master about how dunamancy might fit into their campaign, and how your character's story could be woven into that lore.": "在Wildemount以外的战役中，没有派系控制的地下魔法，所以这个奥术学科的实施是完全开放的。请与你的地下城管理人商讨如何将地下魔法融入他们的活动中，以及如何将你的角色的故事编入该传说。",
	"Life is an extended series of choices. Every crossroads offers paths to different possibilities. The reality of each possible choice begins to coalesce as you approach the moment of decision, with multiple timelines humming with opportunity. Once a choice is made, one path sparks to life and continues while others fade, their energy of potentiality diffusing into the multiverse. A rare few characters learn to invoke and harness this released dunamis in the throes of battle to enhance their martial capabilities—and such warriors are uniformly feared.": "生活是一连串选择的延伸。每个十字路口都提供了通往不同可能性的道路。当你接近决定的时刻，每个可能的选择的现实开始凝聚，多条时间线充满了机会。一旦做出选择，一条道路就会迸发出生命的火花并继续下去，而其他道路则会消逝，其潜在的能量会扩散到多元宇宙中。少数角色学会了在战斗中调用和利用这种被释放的杜纳米斯，以增强他们的武术能力--这样的战士总是令人生畏。",
	"The fighter takes many forms in Wildemount, from the grizzled mercenary who earns their keep by the might of their blade, to the dedicated soldier who fights for the banner of their homeland, to the hearty treasure hunter whose skill with a weapon is their finest asset.": "在荒野山庄，战士有多种形式，有靠刀枪不入挣钱的灰头土脸的雇佣兵，有为祖国的旗帜而战的敬业的士兵，还有以武器技能为最佳资产的健壮的寻宝者。",

	"Dunamancy spells are readily available to the wizard subclasses in this chapter and should not be simply added to the full spell lists of other spellcasting classes. However, the Dungeon Master can consider allowing other spellcasting classes opportunities throughout the campaign to learn a handful of dunamancy-themed spells as rewards.

There are many unique ways to bring these spells into your game without requiring any specific dunamis-wielding subclasses to be present in the adventuring party.": "本章中的巫师子类很容易获得暗黑系法术，不应该简单地加入到其他法术类的完整法术列表中。然而，地下城管理人可以考虑在整个战役中允许其他法术等级有机会学习少数几个以地下魔法为主题的法术作为奖励。也许角色们发现了一批魔法违禁品，其中有几张法术卷轴，或者一个旅行的圣徒与一个友好的牧师角色一起休息了一段时间，打开了他们对宇宙中一些奇怪的秘密的思考，解锁了一两个法术。有许多独特的方法可以将这些法术带入你的游戏，而不需要在冒险队伍中出现任何特定的挥舞杜纳米斯的子类。",
	"The spells are presented in alphabetical order.": "这些咒语是按字母顺序排列的。",
	"The heroic chronicle is a system that allows players and Dungeon Masters to work together to build a compelling character story. It even allows characters to gain additional proficiencies, magic items, spells, or feats before the campaign begins. This section assumes that the player is starting from scratch—without having chosen a race, class, or background for their character. The events that occur as a result of these random rolls inform what kind of character the player has. A player who already has a character concept in mind can choose options from the tables instead of rolling randomly, ignoring anything that doesn't fit their character concept. If you're a player using these tables, don't be surprised if creating a backstory inspires you to change some aspect of your character concept. Let this tool inspire your imagination rather than limit it.": "英雄编年史是一个允许玩家和地下城主共同构建一个引人注目的角色故事的系统。它甚至允许角色在活动开始前获得额外的能力、魔法物品、法术或功绩。本节假设玩家从头开始--没有为他们的角色选择种族、等级或背景。这些随机卷的结果所发生的事件告知了玩家拥有什么样的角色。已经有了角色概念的玩家可以从表中选择选项，而不是随机滚动，忽略任何不符合他们角色概念的东西。如果你是一个使用这些表格的玩家，如果创建一个背景故事激发你改变你的角色概念的某些方面，请不要感到惊讶。让这个工具激发你的想象力，而不是限制它。",
	"The \"Backstory\" section of the chronicle roots a character's history in the land of Wildemount by helping the player determine the character's nation, home settlement, and relationships with family members, allies, and rivals. It helps establish major events that happened to the character before the campaign began. Options for determining a character's favorite food and mysterious secrets can help further define a character's relationship to their homeland and the other party members.": "编年史中的 \"背景故事 \"部分通过帮助玩家确定角色的国家、家庭居住地以及与家庭成员、盟友和对手的关系，将角色的历史扎根于荒野山庄的土地。它有助于建立在战役开始前发生在角色身上的重大事件。确定角色最喜欢的食物和神秘的秘密的选项可以帮助进一步确定角色与他们的祖国和其他党员的关系。",
	"The \"Prophecy\" section of the chronicle sets out three aspirations or goals that the player has for their character. Prophecy goals can help players and DMs create engaging stories that make the game more interesting. Each time a goal is met, it takes on a prophetic tone as a character achieves something they were driven or destined to do. Completing a prophecy goal grants the character a mechanical benefit as a reward.": "年表的 \"预言 \"部分列出了玩家对其角色的三个愿望或目标。预言目标可以帮助玩家和管理员创造引人入胜的故事，使游戏更加有趣。每当一个目标被实现时，它就有了预言的意味，因为角色实现了他们被驱使或注定要做的事情。完成一个预言目标会给角色一个机械的好处作为奖励。",
	"Dungeon Masters can also use the heroic chronicle process to generate villains with histories and motivations grounded in the dangerous lands of Wildemount.": "地下城主也可以使用英雄编年史的过程来生成具有历史和动机的反派，这些反派都是建立在荒野山庄的危险土地上的。",

	"Your background determines your place in the world. Within the strict hierarchy of the Dwendalian Empire, a family with a poor social status is worth less than the soil they till, while a family of great renown enjoys all the privileges of high society. Most folk toil in the same profession from the day they're old enough to work until the day they die, and few families ever rise to glory from obscurity. That's just the way of things.": "你的背景决定了你在这个世界上的地位。在德文达尔帝国严格的等级制度下，一个社会地位低下的家庭，其价值还不如他们耕种的土地，而一个声名显赫的家庭则享有上流社会的所有特权。大多数人从可以工作的那一天起就在同一个行业中辛勤劳作，直到他们死去的那一天，很少有家庭从默默无闻中崛起，获得荣耀。这就是事物发展的规律。",
	"You, however, are an adventurer. Though your social status is determined by your background and your country of origin, you have the power to rebel against the hierarchies of your land and change your fate. Your background doesn't change, nor do the proficiencies and other benefits you gain because of it. But the social status associated with your background might shift over the course of your backstory—and over the course of your adventures.": "然而，你是一个冒险家。虽然你的社会地位是由你的背景和你的原籍国决定的，但你有能力反抗你的土地的等级制度，改变你的命运。你的背景不会改变，你因此而获得的能力和其他好处也不会改变。但与你的背景相关的社会地位可能会在你的背景故事中发生变化--在你的冒险过程中。",

	"Both the Clovis Concord and their hated nemesis, the Revelry pirates, prize personal freedom over all other things. The Revelry simply takes this ideology one bloody step further. People of the Concord celebrate folk heroes and entertainers, and all other people who might become celebrities, iconoclasts, and figures of legend.": "无论是克洛维斯康科德还是他们讨厌的克星--启示录海盗，都把个人自由看得比其他一切都重要。启示录只是将这种意识形态向前推进了一步。康科德的人庆祝民间英雄和艺人，以及所有其他可能成为名人、偶像派和传奇人物的人。",
	"At the same time, the common working-class sailor is a symbol of the Concord's strength. As with the crew of a well-run ship, the small actions of individuals can have a huge impact when all are working toward common goals. Common sailors despise the Revelry, and noteworthy sailors might even have a rival within the Revelry.": "同时，普通工人阶级的水手也是康科德号力量的象征。就像一艘运营良好的船的船员一样，当所有人都在为共同的目标努力时，个人的小动作也会产生巨大的影响。普通水手看不起 \"启示录 \"号，值得注意的水手甚至可能在 \"启示录 \"号内有对手。",
	"The Dwendalian Empire prizes king and country over personal freedoms—at least as far as the freedoms of the poor are concerned. For the wealthy noble class, most laws are mere guidelines, since bribery and political favors can make almost any problem go away.": "德文达尔帝国重视国王和国家，而不是个人自由--至少就穷人的自由而言是如此。对于富有的贵族阶级来说，大多数法律仅仅是指导方针，因为贿赂和政治恩惠几乎可以使任何问题消失。",
	"In the Dwendalian Empire, rural folk are seen as honest, hardworking, and pious, while the wealthy ruling class are viewed as beneficent patricians—or as miserly tyrants. Patriotism is a core virtue, and enlisting in the Righteous Brand and adhering to the empire's strict religious laws are the most patriotic acts of all.": "在德文达尔帝国，农村居民被视为诚实、勤劳和虔诚，而富有的统治阶级则被视为仁慈的贵族或吝啬的暴君。爱国主义是一种核心美德，而加入正义的品牌和遵守帝国严格的宗教法律是最爱国的行为。",
	"The Greying Wildlands and the settlement of Shadycreek Run are lawless. Crime is a virtue here, mercy a vice.

	"Travel farther north, however, and one reaches the Diarchy of Uthodurn, a stable and ancient city ruled by elves and dwarves. Here, order and art are prized over chaos and personal enrichment. If your character is from Uthodurn rather than Shadycreek Run, replace any rival you gain from the Social Status Relationships table with an ally, and vice-versa.": "然而，再往北走，就会到达乌索杜恩的帝制，一个由精灵和矮人统治的稳定而古老的城市。在这里，秩序和艺术比混乱和个人财富更受重视。如果你的角色来自Uthodurn，而不是Shadycreek Run，那么将你从社会地位关系表中获得的任何对手替换为盟友，反之亦然。",
	"Accumulating knowledge and achieving spiritual enlightenment are the virtues of the Kryn Dynasty, whose society is built around the tenets of the Luxon. Artists, entertainers, artisans, and all people who create are well-valued in Kryn society. Yet in this age of war, people whose skills allow them to destroy are paradoxically prized just as highly.": "积累知识和实现精神启蒙是克莱恩王朝的美德，其社会是围绕卢克逊的信条建立的。艺术家、艺人、工匠和所有创造的人在克莱恩社会中都很受重视。然而，在这个战争年代，那些具有破坏能力的人也同样受到高度重视。",
	"To the Kryn, a person's background is less important than the experiences they've accumulated—particularly for those who have begun walking the sacred path known as consecution. Nonetheless, even the most enlightened society can't help but look down upon its lowest citizens and sneer at its haughty elite. Once all beings are beloved by the Luxon, perhaps these ills of society will be purged once and for all.": "对克莱恩人来说，一个人的背景不如他们所积累的经验重要--特别是对那些已经开始走神圣道路的人来说，这就是迫害。尽管如此，即使是最开明的社会也会忍不住看不起其最底层的公民，对其傲慢的精英嗤之以鼻。一旦所有众生都受到卢克松的爱戴，也许社会的这些弊端将被彻底清除。",
