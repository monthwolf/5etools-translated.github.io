	"The world of Eberron has a rich history built on heroic deeds, evolving magic, and the wounds of a long, devastating war. Action, adventure, good, evil, and a thousand shades of gray paint the landscape in broad strokes. Ancient mysteries await discovery so they can influence the world and its people.": "Eberron世界有着丰富的历史，它建立在英雄的事迹、不断发展的魔法以及长期的、毁灭性的战争的创伤之上。行动、冒险、正义、邪恶，以及无数的灰色阴影，都在大笔大笔地描绘着这个世界。古老的奥秘等待着人们去发现，从而影响这个世界和它的人民。",
	"Magic is built into the very fabric of the world. It pervades everyday life. It provides comforts and conveniences unknown in either the modern world or any world of medieval fantasy. Great cities where castles scrape the sky prosper throughout the continent of Khorvaire, and a thriving aristocracy of merchant families controls much of the world's economy thanks to the edge given them by the mysterious and rare dragonmarks. Its people harness magic as a tool—to build cities, to sail ships through the skies, and to create both wonders and weapons.": "魔法是建立在世界的结构中的。它弥漫在日常生活中。它提供了现代世界或任何中世纪幻想世界所不知道的舒适和便利。在整个霍尔韦尔大陆上，城堡在天空中飞舞，一个繁荣的商人家族贵族控制着世界经济的大部分，这要归功于神秘而稀有的龙纹给他们带来的优势。它的人民利用魔法作为工具，建造城市，在天空中航行，并创造奇迹和武器。",
	"Heroes come in all shapes and sizes, all classes and races. They travel the world, battling villains in instants of over-the-top action. And they unearth fabulous treasure, and deal with narrow escapes and ominous mysteries that are as likely to shed light on centuries of secrets as they are to threaten the world's safety.": "英雄有各种形状和大小，各种等级和种族。他们周游世界，在瞬息万变的行动中与恶棍搏斗。他们发掘出神奇的宝藏，处理险象环生和不祥的谜团，这些谜团既可能揭开几个世纪的秘密，也可能威胁到世界的安全。",
	"Eberron embraces swashbuckling action and pulp adventure while adding a layer of noir intrigue. Stories don't always end well, and there isn't a perfect answer to every problem. The Last War turned old allies into bitter enemies and destroyed an entire nation, leaving behind terrible scars. Crime and corruption lurk in the great cities of Khorvaire. Hidden dragons shape the course of history, and sinister fiends influence the dreams of the unwary. Yet mortal greed and ambition might prove more dangerous than any dragon or fiend. This darkness affords opportunities for a group of bold adventurers to make a difference—for better or for worse.": "Eberron拥抱了挥舞的动作和纸浆冒险，同时加入了一层黑色的阴谋。故事的结局并不总是好的，也不是每个问题都有完美的答案。最后的战争将旧的盟友变成了痛苦的敌人，摧毁了整个国家，留下了可怕的伤痕。犯罪和腐败潜伏在Khorvaire的伟大城市中。隐藏的龙塑造了历史的进程，阴险的魔鬼影响着不怀好意者的梦想。然而，凡人的贪婪和野心可能比任何龙或魔鬼更危险。这片黑暗为一群大胆的冒险家提供了改变现状的机会--无论好坏。",

	"What is Eberron? Here are the key things to know:": "什么是Eberron？以下是需要了解的关键事项。",
	"{@b 1. The Last War Has Ended—Sort Of}. The Last War plunged the continent of Khorvaire into civil war more than a century ago, shattering the Five Nations that made up the kingdom of Galifar. Just two years ago, the war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Thronehold and the establishment of twelve recognized nations and a tenuous peace. The conflicts, the anger, and the pain of the long war remain, however, and the new nations seek every advantage as they prepare for the next war to break out on the continent.": "{@b 1. The Last War Has Ended—Sort Of}. 一个多世纪前，最后一次战争使霍尔韦尔大陆陷入内战，使组成加利法尔王国的五个国家支离破碎。就在两年前，战争结束了，签署了《王权条约》，建立了12个公认的国家和脆弱的和平。然而，长期战争的冲突、愤怒和痛苦依然存在，新的国家在为大陆上爆发的下一场战争做准备时寻求一切优势。",
	"{@b 2. Dragonmarked Dynasties}. The great dragonmarked families are the barons of industry and commerce throughout Khorvaire and beyond. Their influence transcends political boundaries, and they remained mostly neutral during the Last War. Not technically citizens of any nation, the matriarchs and patriarchs of each house live in splendor within their enclaves and emporiums located throughout Khorvaire. These dynastic houses of commerce derive their power from dragonmarks—hereditary arcane sigils that manifest on certain individuals within the family, granting them limited but useful magical abilities associated with the trade guilds each family controls.": "{@b 2. Dragonmarked Dynasties}. 伟大的龙纹家族是整个Khorvaire及其他地区的工业和商业男爵。他们的影响力超越了政治边界，在最后的战争中他们大多保持中立。严格来说，他们并不是任何国家的公民，每个家族的族长和元老都在他们位于霍尔韦尔各地的飞地和商场里过着辉煌的生活。这些商业王朝的权力来自于龙纹--遗传性的奥术符号，这些符号体现在家族中的某些人身上，赋予他们与每个家族控制的贸易行会相关的有限但有用的魔法能力。",
	"{@b 3. Lands of Intrigue}. The war is over, and the nations of Khorvaire now try to build a new age of peace and prosperity. Ancient threats linger, however, and the world needs heroes to take up the cause. Nations compete on many levels—over economic dominance, political influence, territory, magical power, and more—each looking to maintain or improve its status by any means short of all-out war. Dragonmarked houses, churches both pure and corrupt, crime lords, monster gangs, psionic spies, arcane universities, secret societies, sinister masterminds, dragons, and a multitude of organizations and factions join the struggle for position and power in the aftermath of the Last War.": "{@b 3. Lands of Intrigue}. 战争结束了，Khorvaire的国家现在试图建立一个和平和繁荣的新时代。然而，古老的威胁仍然存在，世界需要英雄们来承担起这个责任。各个国家在许多层面上竞争，包括经济主导地位、政治影响、领土、魔法力量等等，每个国家都希望通过任何手段来维持或提高自己的地位，而不是通过全面战争。龙纹屋、纯洁和腐败的教会、犯罪首脑、怪物帮派、幻术间谍、奥术大学、秘密社团、阴险的主谋、龙，以及众多组织和派别都加入了最后战争后的地位和权力争夺战中。",
	"{@b 4. A Continent of Adventure}. From the jungles of Q'barra to the blasted hills and valleys of the Demon Wastes, from the skyscrapers of Sharn to the dinosaur-filled Talenta Plains, Eberron is a world of adventure. Adventures can draw heroes from one exotic location to another across the continent of Khorvaire. The quest for the Mirror of the Seventh Moon might take the heroes from a hidden mountain shrine in Darguun to a ruined castle in the Shadow Marches and finally to a dungeon deep below the Library of Korranberg. Through the use of magical transportation, heroes can reach a wide range of environments over the course of an adventure, and thus deal with a diverse assortment of monsters and other challenges.": "{@b 4. A Continent of Adventure}. 从Q'barra的丛林到恶魔荒原的爆炸山丘和山谷，从Sharn的摩天大楼到充满恐龙的Talenta平原，Eberron是一个冒险的世界。冒险可以把英雄们从一个异国情调的地方吸引到霍尔韦尔大陆上的另一个地方。对第七月之镜的探索可能会把英雄们从达尔古恩的一个隐秘的山间神殿带到阴影地带的一个破败的城堡，最后到科兰伯格图书馆下面的一个地牢。通过使用魔法运输工具，英雄们可以在冒险过程中到达广泛的环境，从而应对各种各样的怪物和其他挑战。",
	"{@b 5. A World of Magic}. The technology of Eberron has developed not through the advance of science but by the mastery of magic. The widespread use of magic pervades life in the cities and towns. Airships and rail transport make rapid travel across the continent possible. A working class of minor mages, called magewrights, uses spells to provide energy and other necessities. Advances in magic item creation have led to everything from self-propelled farming implements to sentient, free-willed beings created in artificers' forges. With the aid of rare crystals called dragonshards, dragonmarks can be made more powerful, elementals can be controlled and harnessed, and magic items can be crafted and shaped.": "{@b 5. A World of Magic}. Eberron的技术不是通过科学的进步而是通过对魔法的掌握而发展起来的。魔法的广泛使用充斥着城市和城镇的生活。飞船和铁路运输使跨越大陆的快速旅行成为可能。一个由小法师组成的工作阶层，被称为魔法师，利用法术提供能源和其他必需品。魔法物品创造的进步导致了从自走式农具到在工匠的锻造中创造的有知觉的、自由意志的生命的一切。在被称为龙石的稀有水晶的帮助下，龙印可以变得更加强大，元素可以被控制和驾驭，魔法物品也可以被制作和塑形。",
	"{@b 6. New Races}. In addition to the common player character races found in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, players can choose to play orc or goblinoid characters in Eberron. Or they can choose one of four new races: {@race changeling|ERLW|changelings}, {@race kalashtar|ERLW}, {@race shifter|ERLW|shifters}, and {@race warforged|ERLW}. Changelings have minor shapechanging abilities similar to those of doppelgangers. Kalashtar are planar entities merged with human hosts, giving them telepathic abilities. Shifters developed from the mixing of humans and lycanthropes, a union that grants them limited bestial abilities and feral instincts. The warforged are a constructed race created during the Last War, seeking to find its place in a post-war world.": "{@b 6. New Races}. 除了{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中常见的玩家角色种族外，玩家可以选择在Eberron中扮演兽人或哥布林人角色。或者他们可以从四个新种族中选择一个。{@race changeling|ERLW|changelings}, {@race kalashtar|ERLW}, {@race shifter|ERLW|shifters}, 和 {@race warforged|ERLW}。变身者拥有类似于二重身的轻微变身能力。Kalashtar是与人类宿主合并的平面实体，赋予他们心灵感应的能力。变形人由人类和狼人的混合发展而来，这种结合赋予他们有限的兽性能力和野性的本能。战神是在最后一次战争中创造出来的一个构造种族，他们试图在战后的世界中找到自己的位置。",
	"{@b 7. D&D with a Twist}. Every race, monster, spell, and magic item in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, and {@book Monster Manual|MM} has a place somewhere in Eberron, but it might not be the place you expect. Eberron has a unique spot in the D&D multiverse, and many familiar elements of the game play different roles in the world. In particular, mortal creatures are products of culture and circumstances, rather than the direct influence of the gods. As a result, you can't assume that a gold dragon is good or a beholder is evil; only in the case of celestials, fiends, and certain other creatures whose identity and worldview are shaped by magic (such as the curse of lycanthropy) is alignment a given.": "{@b 7. D&D with a Twist}. {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}、{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}和{@book Monster Manual|MM}中的每个种族、怪物、咒语和魔法物品都在Eberron的某个地方有一席之地，但可能不是你期望的地方。Eberron在D&D多元宇宙中有着独特的位置，许多熟悉的游戏元素在这个世界中扮演着不同的角色。特别是，凡人生物是文化和环境的产物，而不是诸神的直接影响。因此，你不能假设金龙是好的，或看守者是邪恶的；只有在天人、魔人和某些其他生物的身份和世界观由魔法塑造的情况下（如狼人的诅咒），才会有一致的看法。",
	"Every child knows the story of the Progenitor Dragons: Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber. In the dawn of time, these three cosmic beings created thirteen planes of existence, each embodying a concept. Their final work was the Material Plane, where all ideas would become manifest: a realm that could know war and peace, life and death, order and chaos. But cruel Khyber sought ultimate dominion over this new reality. She struck Siberys without warning and tore him apart. Eberron wrestled with Khyber and bound the traitor in her coils but could not defeat her. So Eberron became a living prison, a world that would forever contain Khyber's evil.": "每个孩子都知道始祖龙的故事：西伯利亚斯、艾伯伦和凯伯尔。在时间的黎明，这三个宇宙生物创造了13个存在的平面，每个平面都体现了一个概念。他们的最终作品是物质界，在那里所有的想法都将得到体现：一个可以知道战争与和平、生命与死亡、秩序与混乱的领域。但残酷的凯伯寻求对这个新现实的最终支配权。她毫无征兆地打击了西伯利亚，并将他撕碎。Eberron与Khyber搏斗，将叛徒捆绑在她的线圈中，但无法击败她。于是Eberron成为了一个活生生的监狱，这个世界将永远容纳Khyber的邪恶。",
	"Almost every culture in the world shares this story as a myth that explains the world. Shattered Siberys became the ring of golden dragonshards wrapped around the planet, said to be the source of magic. Eberron is the world, the source of all natural life. And Khyber is the Underdark and the source of aberrations and fiends, forever struggling against her bonds and yearning to destroy the world above.": "世界上几乎所有的文化都分享这个故事，作为解释世界的神话。碎裂的西伯利亚成为包裹着地球的金色龙鳞环，据说是魔法的来源。Eberron是世界，是所有自然生命的来源。而凯伯是地下世界，是反常者和恶魔的源头，永远在与她的束缚作斗争，渴望摧毁上面的世界。",
	"Another tale shared across cultures describes one more conflict that occurred in the first age of the world. Long ago, powerful archfiends known as the Overlords and their armies of rakshasa and lesser fiends dominated Eberron. Forces of light—some versions of the story say the nine gods of the Sovereign Host, others say an alliance of dragons and celestials—eventually defeated the Overlords. But these fiends couldn't be destroyed; instead, their immortal essences were bound in Khyber. Whatever the true details of this tale, this much is true: if the Overlords ever break their bonds, the consequences would be catastrophic.": "另一个跨文化共享的故事描述了发生在世界第一个时代的另一场冲突。很久以前，被称为 \"霸主 \"的强大的大恶魔和他们的罗刹和小恶魔的军队统治了Eberron。光明的力量--有些版本的故事说是主宰的九个神，有些说是龙和天人的联盟--最终打败了霸主。但这些恶魔无法被消灭；相反，他们不朽的精华被束缚在开伯尔。无论这个故事的真实细节如何，有一点是真实的：如果霸主们打破他们的束缚，后果将是灾难性的。",
	"Over the course of millennia, numerous civilizations rose only to fall. Giants built mighty kingdoms on the continent of Xen'drik that were devastated by a war with the dragons of Argonnessen. The goblin empire of Dhakaan ruled Khorvaire until its reign was shattered by an invading army of mind flayers, beholders, and the foul creatures that created them. Today these civilizations are known only through the remnants left behind.": "在几千年的时间里，许多文明都在崛起，却又在衰落。巨人在Xen'drik大陆上建立了强大的王国，但在与Argonnessen的龙的战争中遭到破坏。达卡安（Dhakaan）的地精帝国统治着霍尔韦尔，直到它的统治被一支入侵的心灵感应者、持有者和创造他们的肮脏生物的军队所粉碎。今天，这些文明只能通过留下的残余物来了解。",
	"In the modern age, the greatest power was the kingdom of Galifar, which covered most of the continent of Khorvaire. The Five Nations—Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, Thrane, and Cyre—formed the heart of the kingdom. Although each has a unique cultural identity, they share this unified foundation. Families are spread across the Five Nations; the rulers of the Five Nations descend from the Wynarns, the royal bloodline of Galifar. Despite their differences, an Aundairian has more in common with a Thrane than with a Zil gnome or a Lhazaar pirate.": "在现代，最强大的力量是加利法尔王国，它覆盖了霍尔韦尔大陆的大部分地区。五个国家--Aundair、Breland、Karrnath、Thrane和Cyre--构成了这个王国的核心。虽然每个国家都有独特的文化特征，但它们都有这个统一的基础。家庭分布在五国之间；五国的统治者都是加里法尔的皇室血统--怀纳恩的后代。尽管存在差异，但一个昂代尔人与瑟兰人的共同点要比与齐尔地精或拉扎尔海盗的共同点多。",
	"A century ago Galifar collapsed into civil war, and the Five Nations became separate countries at odds with their neighbors. The Last War came to an end after Cyre was destroyed in a cataclysm known as the Mourning. The Five Nations remain divided today, sharing Khorvaire with the new nations established by the Treaty of Thronehold. The remaining Five Nations remain the largest and most powerful countries in Khorvaire.": "一个世纪前，加利法尔陷入内战，五国成为与邻国不和的独立国家。在赛尔在一场被称为 \"哀悼 \"的大灾难中被摧毁后，最后的战争结束了。今天，五国仍然处于分裂状态，与《王权条约》所建立的新国家共享霍尔韦尔。剩下的五国仍然是霍尔韦尔最大和最强大的国家。",
	"The Treaty of Thronehold officially ended the Last War. The treaty recognized the following nations as sovereign states: Aundair, Breland, Darguun, the Eldeen Reaches, Karrnath, the Lhazaar Principalities, the Mror Holds, Q'barra, the Talenta Plains, Thrane, Valenar, and Zilargo. These nations abide by a common set of laws and maintain diplomatic relations. The Demon Wastes and Shadow Marches regions have no unified government. Droaam has declared itself a nation but has yet to be recognized by the treaty nations.": "王权条约》正式结束了最后一次战争。该条约承认以下国家为主权国家。昂代尔（Aundair）、布雷兰德（Breland）、达尔古恩（Darguun）、艾尔迪恩（Eldeen Reaches）、卡尔纳特（Karrnath）、拉扎尔（Lhazaar）公国、姆罗尔（Moror）领地、卡巴拉（Q'barra）、塔伦塔平原（Talenta Plains）、瑟兰、瓦勒纳和齐拉尔戈。这些国家遵守一套共同的法律并保持外交关系。恶魔荒原和阴影牧场地区没有统一的政府。Droaam已经宣布自己是一个国家，但还没有被条约国家承认。",
	"Although Eberron is a vast world with many continents and cultures, your adventures begin in the land of Khorvaire. Here are a few details about everyday life there.": "虽然Eberron是一个拥有许多大陆和文化的广阔世界，但你的冒险却从Khorvaire的土地上开始。这里有一些关于那里日常生活的细节。",
	"In Eberron, languages reflect culture and geography; a dwarf raised in Breland might not know Dwarvish, but a halfling raised in the Mror Holds might. The historical development of languages and cultures also explains the scripts used to write various languages. For example, the Orc language is written using the Goblin script (rather than Dwarvish, as stated in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}), because the orcs of Khorvaire learned writing from the goblins.": "在Eberron，语言反映了文化和地理；一个在Breland长大的矮人可能不知道矮人语，但一个在Moror Holds长大的半身人可能知道。语言和文化的历史发展也解释了用于书写各种语言的文字。例如，半兽人的语言是用地精文字书写的（而不是矮人文字，如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中所述），因为霍尔韦尔的兽人从地精那里学会了书写。",
	"Common is the language of the Five Nations and the language of trade in Khorvaire, known by most of its people. Goblin was the trade language of the goblin empire of Dhakaan and survives as the primary language in Darguun, Droaam, and the Shadow Marches. Goblin displaced the Orc language; the people of the Shadow Marches typically speak Goblin, and Orc is an exotic language (see the Exotic Languages of Eberron table). Members of all races in Xen'drik speak Giant and use it as their trade language. Infernal is the common tongue of all fiends. Infernal is sometimes called \"Khyber's Speech,\" while Celestial is \"the tongue of Siberys.\"": "通用语是五国的语言，也是霍尔韦尔的贸易语言，为其大多数人所熟知。妖精语是达卡安的妖精帝国的贸易语言，并作为主要语言在达古恩、德罗阿姆和阴影地带生存。妖精语取代了兽人语；阴影地带的人们通常说妖精语，而兽人语是一种外来语言（参见《Eberron外来语言》表）。Xen'drik的所有种族成员都说巨人语，并将其作为他们的贸易语言。地狱语是所有魔族的共同语言。地狱语有时被称为 \"开伯尔之语\"，而天人语是 \"西伯利亚之语\"。",
	"With the DM's approval, you can exchange a language granted by your race for a different language from the Standard Languages of Eberron table. If your halfling was raised in the Mror Holds, you might replace Halfling with Dwarvish to reflect that background. The DM may change the languages assigned to a monster or NPC. An ogre from Droaam likely speaks Goblin instead of Giant.": "经DM批准，你可以将你的种族所赋予的语言换成Eberron标准语言表中的另一种语言。如果你的半身人是在Mror Holds长大的，你可以用矮人语代替半身人，以反映这一背景。DM可以改变分配给某个怪物或NPC的语言。一个来自Droaam的食人魔可能会说哥布林语而不是巨人语。",

	"Most citizens of Khorvaire have a given name followed by a surname. A surname associated with the Common language is usually either a family name or related to an occupation or region of origin. So Sorn Fellhorn, Kara of Windshire, and Tellan Magewright are all names you might find among the common folk.": "大多数霍尔韦尔的公民都有一个名字，后面是一个姓氏。与通用语相关的姓氏通常是一个家族的名字，或者与职业或原籍地区有关。因此，索恩-费尔霍恩（Sorn Fellhorn）、风郡的卡拉（Kara of Windshire）和泰兰-马格莱特（Tellan Magewright）都是你可能在普通民众中找到的名字。",
	"The noble families of Galifar—along with those granted land and titles by one of the sovereigns of the Five Nations—add the prefix ir' to their surname. The name Darro ir'Lain tells you that this individual is a landed noble. The Wynarns were the royal line of Galifar, and the current rulers of Aundair, Breland, and Karrnath are all heirs of the Wynarn bloodline. Thus, Queen Aurala of Aundair is Aurala ir'Wynarn.": "加利法尔的贵族家庭--以及那些被五国君主之一授予土地和头衔的人--在他们的姓氏前加上ir'。Darro ir'Lain这个名字告诉你，这个人是一个有土地的贵族。怀纳恩家族是加利法尔的皇室血统，昂代尔、布雷兰德和卡尔纳特的现任统治者都是怀纳恩血统的继承人。因此，昂代尔的奥拉拉女王就是奥拉拉-伊尔-怀纳恩。",

However, while the designs imprinted on these coins vary based on the source, each of these factions has continued to use the same metals, weights, and denominations set forth in the days of Galifar, maintaining a simple standard for commerce across Khorvaire.": "商人和贵族使用信用证来处理大宗交易，动用Mror Holds的矮人银行的储备。但大多数日常交易都使用贵金属硬币。随着加利法尔王国的崩溃，五国中的每一个国家都开始铸造自己的货币，与Moror的银行家一起。然而，虽然印在这些硬币上的设计因来源而异，但这些派别中的每一个都继续使用加利法尔时代规定的相同金属、重量和面额，为整个霍尔韦尔的商业维持一个简单的标准。",
	"The copper crown (cp) traditionally depicts the crown of Galifar on one face. The crown is the lowest denomination of coin minted under the rule of Galifar, which spawned the saying, \"In Galifar, even the beggars have crowns.\"": "铜冠（cp）传统上是在一面描绘加利法尔的王冠。王冠是加利法尔统治时期铸造的最低面额的硬币，这也催生了一句话：\"在加利法尔，即使是乞丐也有王冠\"。",

However, all the major nations of Khorvaire make use of the four basic coins described above.": "其他一些硬币仍在流通，如Breland的双冠（2cp）和Cyre的银王座（5sp）。然而，Khorvaire的所有主要国家都在使用上述的四种基本硬币。",

	"Lightning rails, airships, and other forms of transportation facilitate travel to exotic locations. Adventures could take you to the colossal ruins left behind by the giants of Xen'drik, the warped landscape of the Mournland, or the dark demiplanes within the underworld of Khyber.

	"Eberron is a world in need of heroes. Lingering tensions of war remain. From the fanatics of the Emerald Claw and the mad cults of the Dragon Below to the flesh-warping daelkyr and ancient archfiends, Eberron faces many threats, and few people besides the player characters are able to stop them. The gods are distant and don't directly intervene. The Silver Flame is a divine force of light, but it can act only through mortal champions. The few powerful benevolent NPCs have limitations: the Keeper of the Flame loses her powers if she leaves her citadel. The Great Druid, the spiritual leader of the Eldeen Reaches, is a tree. Most of the powerful people in the world focus on selfish goals. If an angry dragon attacks Sharn, there's no one else to deal with the problem: the fate of the city is in your hands.": "Eberron是一个需要英雄的世界。挥之不去的战争紧张局势依然存在。从翡翠之爪的狂热者和龙下之城的疯狂邪教，到肉体扭曲的daelkyr和古老的大恶魔，Eberron面临着许多威胁，而除了玩家角色之外，很少有人能够阻止他们。诸神是遥远的，不会直接干预。银色火焰是一种神圣的光的力量，但它只能通过凡人的冠军来行动。少数强大的仁慈的NPC也有限制：火焰的守护者如果离开她的城堡就会失去她的力量。大德鲁伊（Great Druid）是Eldeen Reaches的精神领袖，他是一棵树。世界上大多数有权势的人都专注于自私的目标。如果一条愤怒的龙袭击了沙恩，没有其他人可以处理这个问题：城市的命运掌握在你手中。",
	"What's better than a battle on the deck of an airship? A battle on the deck of an airship that's about to crash! A DM should look for ways to raise the stakes of an Eberron scene, so players feel that every decision matters. This could be driven by the consequences of failure: your actions protect your friends, your house, or your nation. It could involve time: the alarm's been triggered, and you only have 6 rounds before security arrives. Such things can even be incidental. Did you start a fight in an alley behind a bar? Now you notice the drunk ogre sleeping in the shadows. If she wakes up, this could get ugly.": "有什么比飞艇甲板上的战斗更精彩？那就是在即将坠毁的飞艇甲板上的战斗。DM应该寻找方法来提高Eberron场景的赌注，使玩家感到每一个决定都很重要。这可能是由失败的后果驱动的：你的行动会保护你的朋友、你的房子或你的国家。它可能涉及到时间：警报被触发了，在保安到达之前你只有6个回合的时间。这种事情甚至可以是偶然的。你是不是在酒吧后面的小巷里挑起了一场战斗？现在你注意到那个醉醺醺的食人魔在阴影中睡觉。如果她醒了，情况可能会变得很糟糕。",
	"Eberron is rich in villains, from two-bit hoods to continental masterminds. It might be a long time before you're ready to face the sinister leader behind the Order of the Emerald Claw in battle. But part of the flavor of pulp adventure includes recurring villains who closely match the heroes—rivals who advance in power as you do.": "Eberron的反派人物非常多，从二流子到大陆的主谋。在你准备好在战斗中面对翡翠之爪骑士团背后的邪恶领袖之前，可能还需要很长一段时间。但纸浆冒险的部分风味包括反复出现的与英雄密切相关的反派--随着你的力量提升的对手。",
	"Eberron draws inspiration from noir and hard-boiled fiction. It's a world where stories don't always end well, and where there isn't a perfect solution for every problem. In developing characters or stories in Eberron, consider the following concepts.": "Eberron从黑色和硬汉小说中获得了灵感。在这个世界上，故事的结局并不总是好的，也不是每个问题都有完美的解决方案。在开发Eberron的角色或故事时，请考虑以下概念。",

As you consider a flaw for your character, you can add a little hard-boiled flavor by considering the past: Did you make a tragic mistake, and if so, is it something you can ever undo? Did you hurt or betray someone who now seeks revenge? The Regrets table provides a few examples of missteps that might haunt you.": "玩家角色是了不起的人，但他们并不完美。当你考虑你的角色的缺陷时，你可以通过考虑过去来增加一点硬朗的味道。你是否犯了一个悲惨的错误，如果是的话，你是否能挽回？你是否伤害或背叛了某人，而他现在正在寻求报复？遗憾表提供了一些可能困扰你的失误的例子。",

	"You volunteered for mystical experiments. These may be responsible for your class abilities, but you might experience side effects.": "你自愿参加了神秘的实验。这些可能是你的类能力的原因，但你可能会遇到副作用。",
	"A regret helps shape your personality as an element of your past that plays an ongoing role in your story. But perhaps you have a problem that needs to be resolved right now. Another way to define a character's flaw is to roll on the Debts table.": "遗憾有助于塑造你的个性，作为你过去的一个元素，在你的故事中发挥着持续的作用。但也许你现在就有一个需要解决的问题。另一种定义人物缺陷的方法是在债务表上滚动。",
	"Why would you want to take on a debt? The obligation adds depth to a character and provides a compelling, immediate motive for adventuring—you're not just out to get rich; you need gold to get that bounty off your head. It's also an opportunity to establish an element that can be part of a character moving forward. If you're trying to reclaim a magic item from a pawnshop, you declare that your character once owned that magic item—an heirloom, something you created, or a gift from a mentor—you've just temporarily lost it. If you're trying to raise money to join a secret society, it suggests that membership in this organization may be a part of the story later on.": "你为什么要承担债务？债务增加了角色的深度，并为冒险提供了令人信服的直接动机--你不只是为了发财；你需要金子来把赏金从你头上拿下来。这也是一个机会，可以建立一个可以成为角色前进的一部分的元素。如果你想从当铺取回一件魔法物品，你要声明你的角色曾经拥有这件魔法物品--一件传家宝，你创造的东西，或者导师的礼物--你只是暂时失去了它。如果你想筹钱加入一个秘密组织，这表明加入这个组织可能是以后故事的一部分。",
	"Establishing a debt requires collaboration and approval by both player and DM. Work together to develop the details: Who's blackmailing you? Which secret society are you trying to join? What's the story behind the magic item you've pawned, and what sort of item is it?

	"Not every conflict involves a fight between light and darkness. The vast majority of people are driven by simple motives: greed, fear, pride, or ambition. One person just wants to get some gold in their pocket. Another wants to impress a paramour. A leader guiding their nation into war is motivated both by fear of their neighbors and the sincere belief that Khorvaire would be better off under their rule.": "并非每一场冲突都涉及到光明与黑暗之间的斗争。绝大多数人都被简单的动机所驱使：贪婪、恐惧、骄傲或野心。一个人只想在自己的口袋里得到一些金子。另一个人想给姘头留下好印象。一个引导他们的国家进入战争的领导人，既是出于对邻国的恐惧，也是真诚地相信霍尔韦尔在他们的统治下会变得更好。",
	"Primordial forces strive to change or destroy Eberron. But more often, characters encounter misguided patriots, religious extremists, dragonmarked houses looking to wring a few more pieces of gold out of Khorvaire, spies who will do anything to protect their nations, and petty criminals trying to build empires. Eberron holds a place for selfless heroes and truly vile villains, as well as everyone in between.": "原始的力量试图改变或摧毁Eberron。但更多时候，角色们会遇到误入歧途的爱国者、宗教极端分子、希望从霍尔韦尔那里多榨取几块金子的龙纹家族、为保护国家不惜一切代价的间谍，以及试图建立帝国的小罪犯。Eberron为无私的英雄和真正卑鄙的恶棍，以及介于两者之间的每个人提供了一个位置。",
	"In Eberron, it's not always easy to separate the heroes from the villains. Good people can do terrible things, while cruel or heartless people might serve the greater good. An inquisitor might torture innocents in a quest to root out a cult of the Dragon Below; if she's stopped, the cult will survive and flourish. A group of orcs periodically raids a human settlement because the settlers built their village on land sacred to the orcs and are disrupting wards that hold evil at bay. The heroes find a powerful magic weapon in a tomb, but the artifact is the sword of an ancient hobgoblin general, whose descendants want it back. The ways to resolve these problems aren't always simple.": "在Eberron，要区分英雄和恶棍并不容易。好人可以做可怕的事情，而残忍或无情的人则可能为更大的利益服务。一个审问者可能会在寻求根除 \"下龙 \"邪教的过程中折磨无辜者；如果她被阻止了，这个邪教就会生存并发展壮大。一群兽人定期袭击一个人类定居点，因为定居者在兽人的圣地上建造了他们的村庄，并破坏了阻止邪恶的防护措施。英雄们在一座坟墓中发现了一件强大的魔法武器，但这件艺术品是古代妖精将军的剑，他的后人想要回它。解决这些问题的方法并不总是简单的。",
	"Certain situations demand straightforward decisions. If Emerald Claw cultists are about to detonate a necrotic resonator that will kill half of Sharn, they need to be stopped. But in a good Eberron story, the simplest solution may not be the best one.": "某些情况需要直接的决定。如果翡翠之爪的邪教徒要引爆一个会杀死半个沙恩的坏死共鸣器，就需要阻止他们。但在一个好的Eberron故事中，最简单的解决方案可能不是最好的。",
	"A DM who introduces an old buddy who served with the player characters during the war could describe the person and then ask each player to define a connection to them. Present each player with a prompt: {@i Player one, how did Smitty save your life?

	"The Five Nations were built on a magical foundation. To them, magic is a form of science, which can be studied and taught.

	"Artisans called magewrights provide much of this magic. Compared to a wizard or an artificer, a magewright's knowledge of magic is narrow: a locksmith might master the {@spell arcane lock} and {@spell knock} spells to supplement the use of physical tools; a magewright healer could cast {@spell lesser restoration} and {@spell cure wounds} in addition to using healer's kits and the {@skill Medicine} skill. A magewright's casting is also slow and expensive: they typically cast their spells as rituals. They are artisans, not adventurers, and the prosperity of the Five Nations was built on their foundation.": "被称为魔法师的工匠提供了很多这种魔法。与巫师或工匠相比，魔法师的魔法知识很狭窄：一个锁匠可能会掌握{@spell arcane lock}和{@spell knock}的法术来补充物理工具的使用；一个魔法师除了使用治疗包和{@skill Medicine}技能外，还可以施放{@spell lesser restoration}和{@spell cure wounds}。魔法师的施法也很缓慢和昂贵：他们通常以仪式的方式施法。他们是工匠，而不是冒险家，而五国的繁荣是建立在他们的基础之上的。",

	"Powerful dynastic guilds dominate and regulate the magical economy. The dragonmarked houses include barons of industry whose influence rivals that of monarchs.

Shock and fear brought the nations to the negotiating table, and the Last War came to an end in 996 YK with the Treaty of Thronehold.": "最后的战争是一场痛苦的斗争，永远改变了霍尔韦尔的形态。那是一个以联盟变化为标志的世纪，多年的僵局与激烈的战斗交织在一起。这场艰苦的冲突给这片土地和人民留下了深深的伤痕，但更糟糕的事情还在后面。在994年奥拉鲁恩20日，赛尔国家在一场被称为 \"哀悼 \"的魔法大灾难中被吞噬。哀悼的原因仍然不明；许多人担心它是由战争魔法的无节制使用造成的。震惊和恐惧将各国带到了谈判桌上，最后的战争在公元996年以《王权条约》结束。",
	"Although many celebrated the end of the war, others remain unsatisfied with its outcome. No one won the war. Even though people optimistically refer to it as the Last War, most believe that it's only a matter of time until conflict begins anew. The mystery of the Mourning is the only thing holding the warmongers at bay. If someone uncovers the secret of the Mourning—if it can be proven that the Mourning can't happen again, or if its power could be harnessed as a weapon—war could erupt again. Until then, the nations remain in a cold war as each makes preparations and seeks advantages in a conflict that could lie ahead.": "尽管许多人庆祝战争的结束，但其他人仍然对其结果不满意。没有人赢得这场战争。尽管人们乐观地将其称为最后的战争，但大多数人认为，冲突重新开始只是时间问题。悼念的奥秘是唯一能阻止战争贩子的东西。如果有人揭开了哀悼的秘密--如果能证明哀悼不可能再次发生，或者它的力量可以作为一种武器被利用，战争就会再次爆发。在此之前，这些国家仍然处于冷战状态，因为每个国家都在做准备工作，并在可能出现的冲突中寻求优势。",
	"As of 1 Zarantyr 998 YK, it's been less than four years since the Mourning and less than two years since the Last War came to an end. The Last War spanned the continent and lasted for over a century. Most people want to move on. But the scars of decades of war can't be erased so quickly. These are just a few of the ongoing effects of the Last War.": "截至998年扎兰特1日，哀悼会过去不到四年，最后一次战争结束也不到两年。最后一次战争横跨整个大陆，持续了一个多世纪。大多数人都想继续前进。但几十年的战争伤痕不可能这么快就被抹去。这些只是最后一次战争的一些持续影响。",
	"The dragonmarked houses remained neutral in the war and made considerable profit selling their services to all sides. War drives innovation; House Cannith developed many new weapons during the war, including the warforged. House Lyrandar perfected its airships in the last decade of the conflict. Rumors persist of monsters or super soldiers developed by House Vadalis or biological weapons in the hands of House Jorasco.": "有龙纹的家族在战争中保持中立，并向各方出售他们的服务，获得了可观的利润。战争推动了创新；坎尼斯家族在战争期间开发了许多新的武器，包括战争锻造。利兰达（Lyrandar）家族在冲突的最后十年里完善了其飞艇。关于Vadalis家族开发的怪物或超级士兵或Jorasco家族手中的生物武器的传言一直存在。",
	"The dragonmarked houses emerged from the war stronger than ever, with the divided nations dependent on their services. Before the Last War, united Galifar imposed many restrictions on the houses. Today, no monarch can afford to break ties with any of the dragonmarked houses. What will happen if one of the houses goes too far in its pursuit of profit?": "龙纹家族从战争中脱颖而出，比以往任何时候都要强大，分裂的国家都依赖他们的服务。在最后一次战争之前，统一的加利法尔对这些家族施加了许多限制。今天，没有一个君主能够承受与任何一个龙纹家族断绝关系。如果其中一个家族在追求利益方面走得太远，会发生什么？",
	"Before the Last War, Galifar laid claim to all Khorvaire. Several new states emerged over the course of the war. In some cases, this was largely a formality; Galifar never had a strong grip on the Lhazaar Principalities or the gnome nation of Zilargo, and they held the Demon Wastes in name only. Other states were born in violence: the elves of Valenar and the goblins of Darguun seized their realms by force. But Aundair yearns to reclaim the Eldeen Reaches, Breland keeps a wary eye on the monstrous kingdom of Droaam, and many mistrust the Valenar elves. Within the Five Nations, anger remains over how the final lines were drawn; for example, Thrane retains control of the ancient Aundairian city of Thaliost, seized during the war.": "在最后一次战争之前，加利法尔对整个霍尔韦尔提出了要求。在战争过程中出现了几个新的国家。在某些情况下，这在很大程度上是一种形式；加利法尔从未对拉扎尔公国或齐拉尔戈的地精国有过强有力的控制，他们只是名义上拥有恶魔荒原。其他国家在暴力中诞生：瓦勒纳的精灵和达尔古恩的地精通过武力夺取了他们的王国。但昂代尔（Aundair）渴望夺回艾尔迪恩河谷（Eldeen Reaches），布雷兰（Breland）对德罗阿姆（Droaam）的畸形王国保持警惕，许多人不信任瓦伦纳（Valenar）的精灵。在五国内部，人们对最后的分界线仍然心存愤怒；例如，瑟兰仍然控制着在战争中被夺取的昂代尔古城--塔利奥斯特。",
	"The borders between nations demonstrate the impact of generations of conflict. Forests and farmlands scorched by fire and magic are still recovering. Ruined cities have yet to be reclaimed, along with shattered villages and abandoned fortresses. These deserted sites now provide shelter for brigands or are haunted by the restless spirits of those who died in anguish.": "国家之间的边界显示了几代人的冲突所带来的影响。被火和魔法烧焦的森林和农田仍在恢复中。被毁坏的城市还没有被收回，还有破碎的村庄和废弃的堡垒。这些荒废的地方现在为强盗提供庇护，或者被那些在痛苦中死去的人的不安的灵魂所困扰。",
	"This damage reached far beyond the front lines. Magic-fueled weapons, aerial cavalry, and guerrilla forces all struck deep within enemy territory, and the cities of Khorvaire suffered. Wherever you go, you might see the scorch marks of fireballs or wreckage from siege weapons. Every nation is working to repair these wounds, but the damage could linger for generations.": "这种损害远远超出了前线。以魔法为燃料的武器、空中骑兵和游击队都在敌人的领土深处进行打击，霍尔韦尔的城市也遭受了损失。无论你走到哪里，你都可能看到火球的焦痕或攻城武器的残骸。每个国家都在努力修复这些伤痕，但损害可能会持续几代人。",
	"As you create an Eberron character, consider your roots and the impact of the war. Was your hometown destroyed in the war? Is your family thriving, or were its members scattered or slain during the conflict?": "当你创建一个Eberron角色时，考虑你的根源和战争的影响。你的家乡在战争中被摧毁了吗？你的家庭是否兴旺，或者其成员在冲突中被分散或被杀？",
	"Refugees live in every major city, including tens of thousands of exiles produced by Cyre's destruction. Cyrans are a people without a homeland, seeking shelter and sustenance in the lands of their former enemies. Many Cyran refugees are former soldiers who were fighting in enemy territory when the Mourning struck, or they were farmers and merchants who escaped before their nation was consumed. Former nobles now have nothing but rags, and scholars or artists live in alleyways.": "难民生活在每个主要城市，包括成千上万因赛尔的毁灭而产生的流亡者。赛尔人是一个没有祖国的民族，他们在曾经的敌人的土地上寻求庇护和寄托。许多赛伦难民是前士兵，他们在哀伤袭来时正在敌人的领土上作战，或者他们是农民和商人，在他们的国家被吞噬之前逃跑了。昔日的贵族现在除了衣衫褴褛外一无所有，而学者或艺术家则住在巷子里。",
	"Cities and towns still suffer from shortages in the aftermath of the war. Farmlands, workers, and the resources devoted to the war were lost. Nations are recovering, and most essential services and goods are available in major cities. But there is always the possibility that something you want—a luxury item or a spell component—simply isn't available or can be acquired only through the black market.": "城市和城镇在战争结束后仍然遭受着短缺。农田、工人和用于战争的资源都已丧失。国家正在恢复，大多数基本服务和商品在主要城市都可以得到。但总有一种可能，你想要的东西--奢侈品或法术组件--根本就没有，或者只能通过黑市获得。",
	"The nation of Cyre was once the heart of the kingdom of Galifar. The Last War took a heavy toll on Cyre and its citizens, as the nation became a primary battleground where the Five Nations crossed swords. But no one was prepared for the disaster that struck in 994 YK.": "赛尔国曾经是加利法尔王国的心脏。最后的战争给赛尔和它的公民带来了巨大的损失，因为这个国家成为了五国交锋的主要战场。但没有人准备好迎接公元994年的灾难。",
	"Accounts of the Mourning vary. Some say that a blinding light engulfed the battlefield near the Saerun Road. Others say that dead-gray mists rose in the capital city of Metrol and spread from there. Within the space of one day, the nation of Cyre had been engulfed in a wall of mist, and anything caught within the mists was horrifically transformed. Over a million Cyrans were killed on the day of Mourning. Those who survived were soldiers fighting in enemy territory, those living on the borders who were able to flee from the advancing mists, and those few who were able to escape the interior through magical means. On 20 Olarune 994 YK, the nation of Cyre ceased to exist.": "关于悼念活动的说法不一。有人说，一道刺眼的光芒吞噬了赛伦路附近的战场。还有人说，死灰色的迷雾在首都梅特罗尔升起，并从那里蔓延开来。在一天的时间里，赛尔国被一堵雾墙吞没了，任何被卷入雾中的东西都被可怕地改变了。在哀悼日当天，超过一百万赛尔人被杀。那些幸存下来的人是在敌方领土上作战的士兵，那些生活在边界的人能够从推进的迷雾中逃离，以及那些少数能够通过魔法手段逃离内部的人。在公元994年奥拉鲁恩20日，赛尔国不复存在。",
	"The Mourning threw Khorvaire into a state of shock. Who could unleash such power? Was this a weapon, and if so, when would those responsible issues their demands? Were the borders of the lingering walls of mist stable, or could they expand at any moment? What was to be done with the Cyran refugees surging into every adjacent nation? Fear of the Mourning ended the war. But all those questions remain unanswered.": "哀悼会使霍尔韦尔陷入了震惊之中。谁能释放出这样的力量？这是一种武器吗？如果是的话，那些负责任的人何时会提出他们的要求？挥之不去的迷雾之墙的边界是否稳定，或者它们随时都可能扩大？该如何处理涌入每一个邻近国家的赛伦难民呢？恐惧的哀伤结束了战争。但所有这些问题仍未得到解答。",
	"Breland opened its borders to refugees, and Prince Oargev serves as de facto ruler in the area now called New Cyre. Despite its grand name, New Cyre is little more than a vast refugee camp. Other refugees scattered across Khorvaire; some are treated with pity, others with suspicion or anger. And fear of the Mourning hangs like a shadow across Khorvaire. Could it happen again? Is this how the world ends?": "布雷兰德向难民开放边界，奥格夫王子在现在被称为新赛尔的地区担任事实上的统治者。尽管新赛尔的名字很宏伟，但它不过是一个巨大的难民营。其他难民分散在霍尔韦尔各地；有些人受到怜悯，有些人受到怀疑或愤怒。而对哀伤的恐惧像阴影一样笼罩着整个Khorvaire。它可能再次发生吗？世界就是这样结束的吗？",
	"A wall of dead-gray mist surrounds the remnants of Cyre. Beyond the mists lies a land twisted by magic, a wound that will not heal. The blasted land is strangely transformed. In some places, the ground has fused into jagged glass. In others, it is cracked and burned. Broken bodies of soldiers from various sides litter the landscape—soldiers whose dead bodies refuse to decompose. The Mournland is a vast open grave.": "一道死灰色的雾墙围绕着赛尔的遗迹。迷雾之外是一片被魔法扭曲的土地，一个无法愈合的伤口。这片被炸毁的土地发生了奇怪的变化。在一些地方，地面已经融合成锯齿状的玻璃。在其他地方，它是裂开和烧毁的。来自不同阵营的士兵的碎尸遍布这片土地--那些尸体拒绝腐烂的士兵。哀牢地是一个巨大的露天坟墓。",
	"In that horrific landscape, vile magical effects linger, and monsters mutate into even more foul and horrible creatures. Magical effects continue to rain upon the land as storms that never dissipate. Stories speak of living spells—war magic that has taken physical form, sentient fireballs and vile cloudkills that endlessly search for new victims. And angry ghosts continue to fight their final battles.": "在那片恐怖的土地上，卑劣的魔法效果挥之不去，怪物们变异成更加肮脏和恐怖的生物。魔法效应像风暴一样持续不断地降临在这片土地上，永不消散。故事中提到了活生生的咒语--具有物理形态的魔法，有生命的火球和卑鄙的云杀，无休止地寻找新的受害者。愤怒的鬼魂继续进行着他们最后的战斗。",
	"The only thing predictable about the Mournland is that nothing is predictable; any sort of monster or horror could lurk within its borders. And yet it also holds the wealth and treasures of an entire nation, along with the secrets of House Cannith and everything else that was left behind. It's dangerous. It's mysterious. But it's also a dungeon the size of a nation, with opportunities for those brave enough to enter the mists.": "哀牢地唯一可以预测的是，没有什么是可以预测的；任何种类的怪物或恐怖都可能潜伏在它的边界内。然而，它还拥有整个国家的财富和宝藏，以及坎尼斯家族的秘密和其他一切遗留下来的东西。它很危险。它是神秘的。但它也是一个相当于一个国家大小的地牢，为那些有勇气进入迷雾的人提供了机会。",
	"In making an Eberron character, think about the impact the Mourning had on you. If you're from Cyre, did you lose all your family and friends? Are there heirlooms lost in the mists that you're determined to regain, or loved ones you hope to someday see again? Do you feel loyalty to your nation and hope to see it restored, or have you burned Cyre out of your heart?": "在制作Eberron角色时，想想哀伤对你的影响。如果你是赛尔人，你是否失去了所有的家人和朋友？是否有遗失在迷雾中的传家宝，而你决心要夺回，或者你希望有一天能再次见到亲人？你是否对你的国家感到忠诚，并希望看到它得到恢复，或者你已经把赛尔城从你的心中烧掉了？",
	"Even if you're not from Cyre, the Mourning may have had a profound impact on you. Are you afraid that the Mourning could consume all of Khorvaire, or do you prefer not to dwell on such things? If you're religious, did the shocking tragedy of the Mourning cause you to question your faith, or did it reinforce it? If you're an artificer or a wizard, are you interested in studying its effects more closely. Might you even hope to unravel its mysteries yourself? Do you see it solely as a tragedy, or do you hope that this awesome power could somehow be harnessed?": "即使你不是来自赛尔，哀悼也可能对你产生了深刻的影响。你是害怕哀伤会吞噬整个霍尔韦尔，还是不愿意纠结于这种事情？如果你有宗教信仰，哀悼会令人震惊的悲剧是导致你质疑你的信仰，还是加强了它？如果你是一个工匠或巫师，你是否有兴趣更仔细地研究它的影响。你甚至可能希望自己揭开它的神秘面纱？你是仅仅把它看作是一场悲剧，还是希望这种可怕的力量能够以某种方式被利用？",
	"Perhaps you were caught in the Mourning and survived the experience, but its effects remain with you. Consider the following aftereffects of your experience:": "也许你被卷入了哀悼中，并在这次经历中幸存下来，但它的影响仍然伴随着你。考虑一下你的经历的以下后遗症。",
	"As a barbarian, you could have been a simple peasant caught in the Mourning. Everyone else in your community was killed, but their spirits were bound to you. Your barbarian rage represents you channeling these vengeful ghosts. Is there a way to lay these spirits to rest? Do they have unfinished business they want you to resolve?": "作为一个野蛮人，你可能是一个陷入哀伤的普通农民。你社区里的其他人都被杀了，但他们的灵魂却与你紧紧相连。你的野蛮人的愤怒代表你在引导这些复仇的幽灵。有什么办法让这些灵魂安息吗？他们是否有未完成的事情希望你去解决？",
	"As a sorcerer, your magical powers could be the result of your exposure to the Mourning. Were you physically transformed as well, or are your powers the only manifestation of the Mourning? Are you comfortable using your abilities, or are you afraid that you might be increasing the power of the Mourning with each spell you cast?": "作为一个巫师，你的魔力可能是你接触到哀伤的结果。你的身体也被转化了，还是你的力量是哀伤的唯一表现？你在使用你的能力时是否感到舒服，或者你害怕你每一次施法都会增加哀伤的力量？",
	"As a warlock, your patron could be interested in the Mourning and drive you to learn more about it. Your patron could even be part of the Mourning—perhaps a collective of spirits killed on the Day of Mourning, or a dark and enigmatic power that might have been responsible for this tragedy. If you take the latter approach, do you feel that by using your warlock magic you are serving the Mourning? Or do you believe that you siphon power from it and weaken it with your actions?": "作为一个术士，你的守护者可能对哀伤感兴趣，并促使你去了解更多关于它的信息。你的守护者甚至可以是哀悼的一部分--也许是在哀悼日被杀的灵魂的集体，或者是可能对这场悲剧负责的黑暗和神秘的力量。如果你采取后一种方法，你是否觉得通过使用你的术士魔法，你在为哀悼服务？或者你认为你从它那里抽走了力量，用你的行为削弱了它？",
	"As a member of an unusual race, you could say that you are actually a creation of the Mourning. Perhaps your dragonborn was an actual dragon transformed on the day of Mourning. Or maybe your tiefling is touched by the dark power of the Mourning instead of by an infernal power.": "作为一个不寻常的种族的成员，你可以说你实际上是哀伤的创造物。也许你的龙裔是一条真正的龙，在哀悼之日被转化。或者你的铁弗林是被哀伤的黑暗力量所触动，而不是被地狱的力量所触动。",
	"A DM running an Eberron campaign can decide the cause of the Mourning or leave it as a mystery that will never be solved. People in Eberron have many theories about the cause of the Mourning. It's up to the DM to decide if any of them are correct:": "管理员在进行Eberron活动时，可以决定哀悼的原因，或者将其作为一个永远无法解开的谜。在Eberron，人们对哀悼的原因有很多理论。这要由DM来决定他们中是否有人是正确的。",

	"The dragonmarked House Cannith made a fortune selling magical weapons to all sides during the Last War. The Mourning was caused by research gone horribly awry. The secrets can be found in a Cannith research facility within the Mournland. If this knowledge could be recovered and refined, it could produce a terrifying weapon.": "在最后一次战争中，带有龙纹的坎尼斯家族向各方出售魔法武器，赚取了大量财富。哀伤是由于研究出了可怕的差错造成的。这些秘密可以在哀伤之地的坎尼斯研究机构中找到。如果这些知识能够被恢复和提炼，就可以生产出一种可怕的武器。",
	"The Mourning was triggered by the release of an ancient demon overlord trapped since the dawn of time. This mighty fiend is lurking in the Mournland and building its power, but soon it will be ready to act.": "哀悼是由一个自时间之初就被困的古代恶魔霸主的释放所引发的。这个强大的恶魔潜伏在哀伤之地并建立起自己的力量，但很快它就会准备行动。",
	"A DM should consider whether the mystery of the Mourning can be solved and what the consequences would be. Right now, fear of the Mourning holds war at bay.

	"There are patterns hidden in the world. Secrets lie in the conjunctions of the planes and moons, in strange symbols formed by the flowing lava of a volcanic eruption or the fissures caused by an earthquake. Carved in the walls of ancient citadels and on primeval megaliths, knot patterns appear to have meaning that only the contemplative mind can hope to comprehend. To those who can read them, these myriad events and signs form a map of possible futures, a map that can be used to shape the course of history.": "世界上隐藏着一些模式。秘密存在于星球和月亮的交汇处，存在于火山爆发时流动的熔岩或地震造成的裂缝形成的奇怪符号中。雕刻在古代城墙和原始巨石上的绳结图案，似乎只有沉思的人才能理解其含义。对那些能读懂它们的人来说，这些无数的事件和迹象构成了一张可能的未来地图，一张可以用来塑造历史进程的地图。",
	"Scholars call this map the Draconic Prophecy, attributing it to the Progenitor Dragons: Eberron, Siberys, and Khyber. The Prophecy is vast and complex, its signs scattered across the world.

The foremost students of the Prophecy are ancient dragons, immortal fiends, and others who have devoted thousands of years to this work.": "学者们将这张地图称为 \"龙族预言\"，并将其归功于始祖龙。Eberron、Siberys和Khyber。预言是巨大而复杂的，它的标志散布在世界各地。很少有人类甚至是精灵有时间或资源来解开它的秘密。预言的最重要的学生是古龙、不朽的魔王，以及其他为这项工作奉献了数千年的人。",
	"What makes the Prophecy especially complex is that it doesn't define a singular path for the future. Rather, the Prophecy is a map that shows many possible futures, along with the steps that must occur to make that future a reality. A fragment of the Prophecy might say, \"If the Bear King is slain by a sorrowful assassin in the Shadow of the Mourning, the Crown will fall from his nation.\" The \"Bear King\" could refer to King Boranel of Breland, since the bear is Breland's heraldic beast. The \"Shadow of the Mourning\" could mean that Boranel must be slain in the Mournland, or it could mean that the assassination must occur on the anniversary of the Mourning. This passage doesn't say that Boranel will be assassinated or that the Brelish monarchy will fall; it suggests that if Boranel is assassinated under these conditions, then the monarchy will surely fall. But it could also be fulfilled in different ways, if the terms of the Prophecy are interpreted differently. Other fragments of the Prophecy might cover what happens if Boranel is assassinated under other circumstances, or what happens if he dies of natural causes.": "使得预言特别复杂的是，它并没有为未来定义一条单一的道路。相反，预言是一张地图，显示了许多可能的未来，以及为使未来成为现实而必须采取的步骤。预言的一个片段可能会说：\"如果熊王在哀伤的阴影中被一个悲伤的刺客杀死，王冠将从他的国家落下。\" \"熊王 \"可能是指布雷兰的国王博拉内尔，因为熊是布雷兰的纹章兽。哀乐之影 \"可能是指博拉内尔必须在哀乐之地被杀，也可能是指暗杀必须发生在哀乐之日。这段话并没有说博拉内尔会被刺杀，也没有说布雷利什君主制会垮台；它暗示如果博拉内尔在这些条件下被刺杀，那么君主制肯定会垮台。但如果对预言的条款有不同的解释，它也可能以不同的方式得到实现。预言的其他片段可能包括如果博拉内尔在其他情况下被刺杀会发生什么，或者如果他自然死亡会发生什么。",
	"As an adventurer, you could be hired by a scholar trying to piece together a fragment of the Prophecy and clash with a secret society along the way.

How might your travels tie to the fate of your people?": "迄今为止，龙裔在很大程度上忽视了Q'barra的人类，少数遇到龙裔的人类认为他们是某种外来的蜥蜴人。如果你是龙裔，是什么导致你从Q'barra出现？你是为了帮助你的人民还是为了反对尘土领主？你是被游荡的欲望还是好奇心驱使？你是否在最后一场战争中充当过雇佣兵？你的旅行与你的人民的命运可能有什么联系？",
	"Gold is the gift of the mountains, but iron comes from blood and bone.": "黄金是山的礼物，但铁来自血液和骨骼。",
	"The origin of the dwarves is shrouded in mystery. Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from \"a land of endless ice.\" Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.": "矮人的起源被蒙上了一层神秘的面纱。他们的一些传说讲述了一次大迁徙，导致古代矮人从 \"无尽的冰雪之地 \"来到霍尔韦尔。许多人认为这指的是冰霜之城的北极之地，而其他人则声称第一批矮人一定来自里西亚的冰冻平面。无论他们的根在哪里，这些迁徙的矮人在霍尔韦尔的地表下建立了一个强大的国家。",
	"Most dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm below—which was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the Mror Holds, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten.": "大多数矮人的传说并不关心起源的问题，而是停留在古代深居简出的矮人所制作的强大神器和无价之宝，以及他们对达卡安的地精帝国发动的血腥战争。今天的矮人珍惜这个古老国家的记忆，因为霍尔韦尔的所有矮人都是被赶出地下王国的流亡者的后代--这个王国后来被戴尔基尔摧毁。特别是在Moror Holds，许多矮人珍视回到地下世界并重建他们的古老国家的想法，使他们恢复到他们已经完全遗忘的伟大。",
	"The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions—strange symbiotic items (some of which appear in {@book chapter 5|ERLW|12}) that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.": "摩尔大陆的矮人部分是由他们与古老的下层世界的关系决定的。为了重新发现和夺回他们古老国家的财产，矮人找到了许多在帝国最后时期制造的战争武器。其中一些武器是矮人为了对抗达尔凯尔而铸造的，但另一些则是达尔凯尔为他们的奴仆所制造的--奇怪的共生物品（其中一些出现在{@book chapter 5|ERLW|12}中），它们利用宿主的生命力来增强其魔法能力。",
	"Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element of your character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.": "一些部族禁止使用这些共生武器和对达尔凯尔魔法的任何探索，特别是著名的莫洛伦部族。其他人，特别是索多拉克氏族，已经接受了这种魔法来对抗达尔凯尔。定义与这些发现的关系可以成为你的角色背景的一个重要元素；你可能是一个致力于将任何daelkyr魔法的痕迹从下层世界中清除的Mroranon圣骑士或游侠，或者是一个为追求自己的力量以及为你的部族争取荣耀而吸取Xoriat魔法的Soldorak术士。",
	"Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some suggestions that might spark further ideas.": "在扮演Mororian角色时要考虑的另一个重要问题是你为什么要离开Holds。离开Mor's Holds表提供了一些建议，可能会引发进一步的想法。",
	"A feud with a rival clan has gotten out of hand, and it's best that you spend a few decades away from the Holds while things cool down.": "与一个敌对部族的争斗已经失去控制，在事情冷却的时候，你最好离开霍尔兹几十年。",
	"You come from a large family and there's no room for you to shine in your hold, so you hope to make a name for yourself in the wider world.": "你来自一个大家庭，在你的牵制下，没有空间让你发光，所以你希望在更广阔的世界里为自己扬名。",
	"Your clan has arranged your marriage and your future, and you've decided to have a few adventures before you settle down.": "你的宗族已经安排好了你的婚姻和你的未来，你决定在安顿下来之前进行一些冒险。",

	"You've rejected your clan's attitude toward daelkyr magic, earning the enmity of powerful dwarves.": "你拒绝了你的部族对daelkyr魔法的态度，赢得了强大矮人的敌意。",
	"You want to understand how the other peoples of Khorvaire—especially the goblins and orcs—have fought the daelkyr.": "你想了解霍尔韦尔的其他民族--尤其是哥布林和兽人--是如何与戴尔克尔作战的。",
	"Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes—and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of Sharn or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in Thrane more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time.": "矮人分布在整个霍尔韦尔。矮人士兵和工程师是统一五国的军队的一部分，矮人石匠奠定了加利法尔最伟大城市的基础。传统上忠于家庭和部族的矮人，出生在Moror Holds之外的矮人倾向于将他们激烈的部族忠诚度转移到他们的新家--尤其是象征着这些地方的永久性和稳定性的石制品建筑。一个布雷利什矮人可能会对沙恩的塔楼或沃鲁特的大墙感到深深的个人联系；一些矮人比银焰的虔诚追随者更喜欢瑟兰的银焰大教堂。归根结底，大范围的霍尔韦尔的典型矮人比五国的普通人类更爱国，许多矮人在最后的战争中为他们的国家而战，至少有一段时间。",
	"When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War?": "当创建一个来自五国的矮人角色时，既要考虑你对国家的忠诚度，也要考虑你的家庭在你生活中所扮演的角色。你住在家庭附近吗？你最亲近的家人从事什么样的工作，这是否反映在你选择的背景中？你和你的亲戚关系密切吗，或者你们之间有分歧吗？你在上次战争中失去了亲属吗？",
	"The Mark of Warding appears on dwarves of House Kundarak, which had its origins as one of the clans of the Mror Holds. Kundarak dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.": "守护印记出现在昆达拉克家族的矮人身上，该家族起源于莫洛霍尔的一个部族。昆达拉克矮人生活在霍尔韦尔各地，同时与莫尔霍尔家族保持着密切的联系，他们对家族的忠诚度高于任何特定国家。",
	"In addition to providing all manner of security, House Kundarak dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.": "除了提供各种形式的安全保障外，昆达拉克家族还主导着霍尔韦尔的银行业。作为一个有龙纹的家族，它有义务在所有国家的政治中保持中立，包括它的祖国。因此，昆达拉克家族在统治摩尔大陆的铁议会中不再有代表。然而，它对其他部族的影响反映了它的财富和它在霍尔兹以外的世界的地位，昆达拉克成员反对使用达尔凯尔魔法的声音具有重要的影响力。",
	"Put up your swords and talk of peace, or hide behind your walls of stone. When the host of Valenar thunders forth, neither will save you.": "举起你们的剑，谈论和平，或者躲在你们的石墙后面。当瓦勒纳的大军来袭时，两者都无法拯救你们。",
	"Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves of the distant continent of Xen'drik rose up against the giants who ruled over them. This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow—assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen'drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.": "数万年前，遥远的Xen'drik大陆的精灵们奋起反抗统治他们的巨人。这次叛乱是精灵历史上的决定性事件。随着古代战争的进行，巨人的魔法师们将魔法束缚在那些忠于他们的精灵身上，形成了专门猎杀其他亲属的乌鸦刺客。最终，精灵们逃离了Xen'drik，定居在Aerenal岛国，在那里他们分裂成两种不同的文化：内向的Aereni和好战的Tairnadal。因此，近四万年前的一场战争奠定了今天精灵们的生活模式。",
	"Neither the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The drow, though, are virtually unknown on Khorvaire.": "Aereni和Tairnadal（包括Valenar的精灵）都对人类的活动没有太大的兴趣，但几个世纪以来，有少量的精灵移民到了Khorvaire，并或多或少地融入了五国的文化。不过，克罗人在霍尔韦尔几乎无人知晓。",
	"As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship with the past: Do you value the traditions of your ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?": "作为一个整体，精灵们被传统和对过去的尊重所驱动。人类重视创新，而精灵则努力掌握和完善他们祖先的技术，并进行持续几个世纪的研究。在过去的五千年里，精灵社会没有什么变化，而霍尔韦尔则在不断地发展。无论你的精灵角色的起源是什么，请考虑你与过去的关系。你是否重视你祖先的传统？或者你担心你的人民过于沉溺于过去，而需要找到一种适应和前进的方法？",
	"For thousands of years, the island nation of Aerenal has been ruled and protected by the godlike power of the Undying Court, a council of undead high elves. The greatest heroes of the Aereni join the Undying Court after death, joining their heroic ancestors in immortality.": "几千年来，艾瑞纳岛国一直被不死阁的神力所统治和保护，不死阁是由不死的高等精灵组成的议会。艾瑞尼人最伟大的英雄在死后加入不死阁，与他们的英雄祖先一起永生。",
	"The Aereni are isolationists who have little interest in the world beyond their island. The Five Nations are a place of chaos and war, so why would any sensible elf venture into that madness? As you make an Aereni elf character, decide what has caused you to leave your island home and the protection of the Undying Court in order to wander the world. Are you in search of a power that could earn you your place in the Undying Court? Have you been given a quest by one of your own deathless ancestors? Or are you an exile, banished from your homeland for some crime against your people's rulers?": "艾瑞尼人是孤立主义者，对他们岛屿以外的世界没有什么兴趣。五国是一个充满混乱和战争的地方，那么为什么任何明智的精灵都要冒险进入那个疯狂的世界呢？当你塑造一个艾瑞尼精灵的角色时，请决定是什么原因导致你离开你的岛屿家园和不死阁的保护，以便在世界范围内游荡。你是否在寻找一种可以让你在不朽之庭获得地位的力量？你是否被你自己的不死鸟祖先之一赋予了任务？或者你是一个流亡者，因为对你的人民统治者犯下的一些罪行而被放逐出你的家园？",
	"Consider your character's personal and family history. What is your family known for, and how can you prove yourself to be a master of these skills? Do you have ancestors in the Undying Court, and if so, what's your relationship with them? Do you find it challenging to deal with the short-lived races, or are you patient with them?": "考虑你的角色的个人和家庭历史。你的家族以什么著称，你怎样才能证明自己是这些技能的主人？你是否有祖先在不死阁，如果有，你与他们的关系如何？你觉得与短命的种族打交道有挑战性吗，还是你对他们有耐心？",
	"Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars—against giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan—live on after death, becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood, a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did. In this way, the champion comes to embody their ancestor, allowing the dead to live on.": "泰尔纳达尔精灵将自己奉献给了战争艺术。泰尔纳达尔众多战争中最伟大的英雄--对抗巨人、龙和达卡安的冠军--在死后仍然活着，成为泰尔纳达尔的守护神。成年后，泰尔纳达尔精灵会与这些祖先之一建立联系，并努力追随这位祖先的脚步，像守护者一样生活。通过这种方式，冠军来体现他们的祖先，让死者继续生存下去。",
	"The Tairnadal have three distinct lines: the Draleus Tairn, the Silaes Tairn, and the Valaes Tairn. All three lines roam the northern plains of Aerenal, having left the forest long ago, but the Valaes Tairn now reside mostly in Valenar, being the Tairnadal most often encountered in Khorvaire. Despite sharing a homeland with the Aereni, the Tairnadal have distinct religious traditions, revering their patron ancestors rather than the Undying Court.": "泰尔纳达尔人有三个不同的血统：德拉雷斯-泰尔纳、西拉斯-泰尔纳和瓦拉斯-泰尔纳。这三个系都在艾瑞纳北部平原游荡，很久以前就离开了森林，但瓦莱斯-泰恩现在主要居住在瓦勒纳，是在霍尔韦尔最经常遇到的泰恩达人。尽管与艾瑞尼人同属一个家园，但泰尔纳达尔人有独特的宗教传统，他们敬仰自己的守护神祖先，而不是不朽的法庭。",
	"In creating a Tairnadal character, including a Valenar elf, think about your patron ancestor. Most Tairnadal pursue the same class as their patron, so if your character is a wizard, your ancestor was likely a legendary archmage. Was your ancestor a famous blademaster, a stealthy hunter, or a war chanter? Were they chivalrous or merciless? Bold or clever? Whatever their path, it is your duty to follow their example. Is this something you proudly embrace, or do you resist it? Do you know another elf with the same patron ancestor, and what's your relationship to that character? Do you know an elf whose patron ancestor was a bitter rival of yours?": "在创建泰尔纳达尔角色时，包括瓦伦纳精灵，要考虑到你的守护者祖先。大多数泰尔纳达尔人追求的是与他们的守护者相同的等级，所以如果你的角色是一个巫师，你的祖先很可能是一个传奇的大法师。你的祖先是著名的爆破师、隐秘的猎人，还是战神？他们是侠义的还是无情的？大胆还是聪明？无论他们的道路如何，你都有责任以他们为榜样。这是你自豪地接受的东西，还是你抵制的东西？你是否认识另一个有相同守护者祖先的精灵，你和那个人物有什么关系？你是否知道一个精灵的守护者祖先是你的一个劲敌？",
	"Also consider why you are traveling with a group of player characters (who are presumably not also members of your war band) instead of serving with the Tairnadal. Do you experience visions of your patron ancestor driving you on a particular course? Are you pursuing an epic quest that mirrors your ancestor's legendary deeds? Are you seeking vengeance for the death of a friend or ally? Or have you turned away from your people, either by choice or because of the actions of a rival?": "还要考虑为什么你要和一群玩家角色（他们应该不是你的战队成员）一起旅行，而不是为泰尔纳达尔人服务。你是否经历过你的守护神祖先的幻觉，驱使你走上一条特殊的道路？你是否在追寻一个反映你祖先传奇事迹的史诗般的任务？你是否在为朋友或盟友的死亡寻求复仇？或者你已经远离了你的人民，无论是出于选择还是因为对手的行为？",

	"Throughout history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated (as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there. Many of the finest wizards and most renowned artisans in the Five Nations are high elves. Wood elves are found among the rangers and druids of the Eldeen Reaches and stalking the darkest alleys of Sharn.": "纵观历史，精灵们偶尔会迁移到Khorvaire的其他民族中生活。在极少数情况下，整个家族都会搬迁（就像皮亚伦家族在近三千年前所做的那样），但更多的时候，流浪者和流亡者会来到霍尔韦尔，并在那里发展。五国中许多最好的巫师和最著名的工匠都是高等精灵。在Eldeen Reaches的游侠和德鲁伊中可以找到木精灵，在Sharn的最黑暗的小巷中也可以找到木精灵。",
	"As an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions of your ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.": "作为一个在霍尔韦尔出生和长大的精灵，你的角色在寿命较短的种族中成长起来。你可能不像Aereni和Tairnadal那样关注历史和传统；你甚至可以完全活在当下，不关心你的家庭或你的遗产。或者你可以对你祖先的历史和传统着迷，并试图重新学习你的家族所遗忘的方式。",
	"Consider also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last War? Did you fight in the war?": "还要考虑你是否已经超过了人类的朋友，这可能会对你产生什么影响。你是否认识你党内另一位成员的父母或祖父母？你是想向那位早已去世的朋友偿还债务或履行承诺，还是想重拾多年前的友谊的一些火花？你还记得最后一次战争之前的一个时期吗？你在战争中战斗过吗？",
	"Long ago on the continent of Xen'drik, the first drow fought beside the giants against the other elves. Tens of thousands of years have passed, and drow and other elves remember each other only as figures in their legends. The Undying Court and the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal remember the drow, but they have little occasion to teach their living descendants about these shadows of the distant past.": "很久以前，在Xen'drik大陆上，第一批乌鸦与巨人一起战斗，对抗其他精灵。几万年过去了，乌鸦和其他精灵都只记得对方是他们传说中的人物。不朽的法庭和泰尔纳达尔的祖先记得乌鸦，但他们很少有机会向他们活着的后代传授这些遥远的过去的影子。",
	"When the elves fled to Aerenal, the drow remained on Xen'drik as subjects of the giants, and they were caught in the collapse of giant civilization. Today they linger on Xen'drik and have set their own course, free of the giants' malevolent influence.": "当精灵们逃到阿伦纳时，乌鸦作为巨人的臣民留在了Xen'drik，他们被卷入了巨人文明的崩溃之中。今天，他们在Xen'drik徘徊，并确定了自己的方向，摆脱了巨人的恶意影响。",
	"Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across Xen'drik, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a fiery apocalypse. Finally, the Umbragen are descended from drow who fled into the depths of the earth when the giant civilization fell. They wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the daelkyr and the other aberrations of the underworld.": "巨人陨落后形成了三种不同的鸦人文化。数量最多的是武库里（Vulkoori），他们是献给一个叫武库里的蝎子神的猎人。他们在自己的土地上猎杀巨人和其他危险品。在强大的德鲁伊和巫师的领导下，苏拉塔人坚持着可追溯到巨人时代的元素塑造传统。他们生活在整个Xen'drik的少数几个黑曜石城市中，并相信他们注定要在一场火热的天启中净化世界。最后，乌姆拉根（Umbragen）是在巨人文明衰落时逃入地球深处的乌鸦的后代。他们在与达尔凯尔（daelkyr）和其他地下世界的反常者进行的不间断战斗中挥舞着复杂的魔法。",
	"When creating a drow character, think about how you came to Khorvaire. Are you a Vulkoori hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your way in this strange new world? Are you an Umbragen seeking powers that can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a Sulatar pursuing a personal path to glory?": "当创建一个乌鸦角色时，想想你是如何来到Khorvaire的。你是一个随同远征队回到Khorvaire的Vulkoori猎人，现在在这个陌生的新世界中寻找自己的道路？你是一个在无尽的战争中寻求能够帮助你的人民的力量的Umbragen人吗？或者你是一个追求个人荣耀之路的苏拉塔人？",
	"How do you react to meeting members of other elven cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize that most bear little resemblance to the terrors described in your people's legends, or you might have an almost instinctive reaction of distrust. You might have overcome your initial prejudices by the time the campaign begins, or perhaps you're working to build trust with another elf member of your adventuring party.": "在你的旅途中遇到其他精灵文化的成员，你会有什么反应？你可能很快就认识到大多数人与你的民族传说中描述的恐怖没有什么相似之处，或者你可能有一种几乎本能的不信任反应。在活动开始时，你可能已经克服了你最初的偏见，或者你正在努力与你的冒险队伍中的另一个精灵成员建立信任。",
	"The Mark of Shadow first appeared among the elves of the Phiarlan line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from Aerenal to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to House Thuranni. The two houses of shadow control the business of espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate ventures related to art and entertainment.": "阴影印记首次出现在皮亚伦系的精灵中，该家族很快将印记的阴影和幻觉的力量转化为一个经济王朝。对他们亲属的怀疑将他们从艾瑞纳赶到了霍尔韦尔，在最后的战争中，这个家族分裂了，产生了瑟兰尼家族。这两个影子家族控制着整个霍尔韦尔的间谍业务，但他们也经营着与艺术和娱乐有关的更合法的企业。",

	"The average gnome has a love of knowledge that borders on obsession, a curiosity that admits no limits, and a vast collection of potentially useful information on every personal acquaintance. Most gnomes detest physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words—whether that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.": "普通地精对知识的热爱近乎痴迷，好奇心不受限制，并在每个人的熟人身上收集了大量潜在的有用信息。大多数地精厌恶肉体暴力，更喜欢用语言解决问题--无论是吟游诗人的雄辩说服，还是巫师的力量之语，或是流氓的谨慎威胁。他们给人的最初印象是友好的大忙人，总是准备伸出援手或分享故事，同时问一些倾向于稍微私人化的问题。不过，通常情况下，一个开朗和友好的地精正在有条不紊地增加一个知识的精神仓库，有一天可能会提供重要的筹码。",
	"To say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of schemes and feuds, some of which persist well into adulthood. Even a gnome with a good heart and noble goals—of which there are many—often still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable tools of honesty or brute force.": "如果说每个Zil地精都是一个无情的阴谋家，那将是一种伤害性的夸大。不过，阴谋诡计是大多数齐尔人最喜欢的消遣方式。每一个Zilargo的地精孩子都被教导如何操纵和欺骗，当他们成年时，大多数人已经参与了几十个计划和争斗，其中一些一直持续到成年。即使是心地善良、目标高尚的地精--这类人很多--往往还是喜欢使用诡计和狡猾，而不是诚实或蛮力这些不可靠的工具。",
	"Most Zil gnomes belong to the forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as messengers and guides.": "大多数齐尔侏儒属于森林侏儒亚种。他们在幻觉方面的天赋帮助他们进行欺骗和娱乐，他们经常使用小动物作为信使和向导。",

Gnome names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims \"the sweetest song is the name of a friend.\" Personal and clan names are usually at least three syllables long, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.": "Zil社会被划分为主要的家族，每个家族都由多个家庭组成。每个地精除了个人的名字外，还带有一个家族的名字和一个家庭的名字。例如，阿琳娜-洛里丹-莱里斯和塔利安-塔利厄斯-莱里斯是莱里斯家族中不同家族（洛里丹和塔利厄斯）的成员。地精的名字很长，也很抒情；Zil的一句谚语称 \"最甜美的歌是朋友的名字\"。个人和氏族的名字通常至少有三个音节，而且有强烈的典故传统。",
	"As they have for countless generations, insatiable curiosity and endless opportunity draw gnomes from Zilargo into the wider lands of Khorvaire. Most of these dispersed gnomes find new homes and integrate easily into local cultures. Gnomes can be found in any walk of life, whether they be as merchants, magewrights, scholars, or scoundrels. While the gnomes of the Five Nations aren't as inherently devious as their Zil cousins, they share the Zil emphasis on the importance of family.": "正如他们无数代以来所做的那样，永不满足的好奇心和无穷无尽的机会将地精从Zilargo吸引到更广阔的Khorvaire土地。这些分散的地精大多找到了新的家园，并轻易地融入了当地文化。地精可以在任何生活领域被发现，无论是商人、魔法师、学者还是恶棍。虽然五国的地精并不像他们的齐尔表亲那样天生就很狡猾，但他们与齐尔一样强调家庭的重要性。",
	"As a gnome character from the Five Nations, you might have a network of connections to the community your grew up in, likely built on the exchange of information. Alternatively, you might seek your own path in life, avoiding the intrigues your cousins adore.": "作为一个来自五国的地精角色，你可能有一个与你长大的社区的联系网络，可能是建立在信息交流的基础上。或者，你可能会在生活中寻求自己的道路，避开你的表亲们所崇拜的阴谋。",
	"The Mark of Scribing appears among the gnomes of House Sivis. The gnomes of this house were among the first of their kind to leave Zilargo and live in human lands. They love bureaucracy and intrigue as much as the gnomes of their homeland, but they have carefully cultivated a reputation for impartiality and secrecy, since their services rely on trust.": "划线的标记出现在西维斯家族的地精中。这个家族的地精是最早离开兹拉尔戈并生活在人类土地上的同类之一。他们和故乡的地精一样喜欢官僚主义和阴谋诡计，但他们精心培养了公正和保密的声誉，因为他们的服务依赖于信任。",
	"Today, House Sivis provides avenues of communication across Khorvaire. Translation, mediation, interpreting, and legal advocacy all fall within House Sivis's broad purview, and they maintain the network of message stations that allow cross-continent communication.": "今天，House Sivis为整个Khorvaire提供了沟通的渠道。翻译、调解、口译和法律辩护都属于House Sivis的广泛范围，他们维护着允许跨大陆交流的信息站网络。",
	"Hoisting the head by the fading plumes of the ruined helmet, still tied under the chin by a cord, Haruuc raised it in one hand and his bloody sword in the other. \"Your lord is dead!\" he howled in the human language. \"The battle is done! By my sword, I claim this place and name it Rhukaan Draal, the crown city of Darguun, the land of the people!\"": "哈鲁克用毁坏的头盔上渐渐消失的羽翼举起了头，头盔下面还有一根绳子绑着，他一手举着头，一手举着他的血剑。\"你的主人已经死了！\"他用人类的语言嚎叫着。\"战斗结束了! 通过我的剑，我要求这个地方，并将其命名为鲁卡安-德拉尔，达尔古恩的王城，人民的土地！\"",
	"The goblinoid species—goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears—were once the dominant civilization in Khorvaire, with the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan ruling the continent for thousands of years. It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.": "妖精物种--妖精、地精和虫熊--曾经是霍尔韦尔的主导文明，妖精帝国达卡安统治了这片大陆数千年之久。它被与达尔凯尔（daelkyr）及其反常军队的长期冲突所削弱；尽管达尔凯尔被打败了，但疯狂的种子在帝国中生根发芽并将其撕裂。今天，在霍尔韦尔有四种主要的地精文化。",
	"Goblins dwell in most of the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblins are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblins can be found in all walks of life, and goblins served in the armies of the Five Nations during the Last War.": "妖精居住在五国的大多数主要城市中。当人类第一次来到霍尔韦尔时，他们奴役了许多妖精，并在达卡尼废墟的地基上建造了他们的城市。加利法尔结束了奴役的做法，而这些妖精现在是五国的公民。在各行各业都能找到有天赋的地精，在最后的战争中，地精在五国的军队中服役。",
	"As a Ghaal'dar goblinoid, you hold your place through cunning and strength. You may have been a former mercenary now seeking adventure. You could be working as an emissary for one of the Ghaal'dar tribes or even Lhesh Haruuc himself. Or you could have been driven from your tribe by the actions of a rival; perhaps you're seeking allies to reclaim your birthright.": "作为一个加尔达尔的地精，你通过狡猾和力量保持你的地位。你可能曾经是一名雇佣兵，现在正在寻求冒险。你可能是为Ghaal'dar部落之一甚至是Lhesh Haruuc本人工作的使者。或者你可能因为对手的行为而被赶出了你的部落；也许你正在寻找盟友来夺回你的出生权。",
	"The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the Ghaal'dar long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun. They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the Ghaal'dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains had best travel with a Marguul guide.": "马尔古尔虫族很久以前就摆脱了盖尔达尔的桎梏，在达尔古恩南部的海堤山脉夺取了领土。他们是臭名昭著的掠夺者，虽然他们已经与盖尔达尔达成了休战协议，但任何冒险进入海堤山脉的人都最好在马古尔人的指引下旅行。",
	"As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It's certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you've taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally.": "作为玛古尔虫族，你是野蛮的，并以此为荣。马古尔人崇拜嘲讽，相信不择手段的胜利：在战场上没有所谓的荣誉。对于一个玩家角色来说，这当然是一个不寻常的选择，但如果你对某一特定的小民群体有好感，你就可以成为一个强大的盟友。",
	"Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds of corruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.": "虽然达卡尼帝国打败了外星的达尔基尔，但战争留下了腐败的种子，散落在整个帝国。当达卡尼开始衰落时，一些将军和总督聚集了他们的力量，并撤退到地球深处的庇护所，决心保护他们的文明，直到帝国最终能够恢复。几千年后，他们的后裔终于出现了，他们相互竞争，以确定哪位领导人值得拥有帝国的王冠。一旦解决了这个问题，他们将转向征服达尔古恩和霍尔韦尔。",
	"The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.": "达卡尼人的数量远远少于Ghaal'dar人；他们不得不小心翼翼地将人口限制在他们过去时代所居住的地下墓穴中。然而，他们一直保持着让他们的祖先能够主宰大陆的武术纪律和技术。他们的武器制造者甚至比坎尼斯家族的工匠还要出色，他们是加工金刚砂和其他异国金属的专家。任何妄想看不起地精的人都会对达卡尼人的技能感到惊讶。",
	"As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?": "作为一个来自达卡尼部族的冒险者，考虑一下你为什么要与其他玩家角色合作？你是一个收集信息的侦察员吗？你是在寻找盟友来打败对手的部族，还是在支持你自己不太可能争取到的帝国王位？你是一个流亡者吗？如果是的话，你是否希望重新获得你的地位，或者你已经放弃了与达卡尼的联系？",
	"Goblinoid names often feature drawn-out vowel sounds (represented by doubled letters), as seen in the names of both their ancient empire (Dhakaan) and their newborn country (Darguun). Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears use the same names and naming conventions, despite their tribal differences.": "哥布林人的名字通常以拉长的元音（用双字母表示）为特征，这在他们的古老帝国（达卡安）和新生国家（达尔昆）的名字中都可以看到。哥布林、霍布林和虫族使用相同的名字和命名惯例，尽管他们的部落有差异。",
	"If you're playing a goblinoid, your racial traits are determined by whether you're a bugbear, goblin, or hobgoblin.": "如果你扮演的是地精，你的种族特征由你是虫族、地精还是霍布林决定。",

	"From the Towering Woods of the Eldeen Reaches to the slums of Sharn, half-elves are found across Khorvaire. New half-elves are born in every generation from pairings between humans, elves, and other half-elves, with children typically clinging to a parent's culture. Over centuries, though, half-elves have developed their own communities and traditions, giving them an identity strengthened by the rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani. Members of these communities generally dislike the term \"half-elf,\" instead calling themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning \"children of Khorvaire.\"": "从Eldeen Reaches的高耸森林到Sharn的贫民窟，半精灵在整个Khorvaire被发现。每一代都会有新的半精灵从人类、精灵和其他半精灵之间的配对中诞生，孩子们通常依附于父母的文化。不过几个世纪以来，半精灵已经发展出了自己的社区和传统，他们的身份在利兰达尔家族和梅达尼家族的崛起中得到了加强。这些社区的成员通常不喜欢 \"半精灵 \"这个词，而是称自己为霍拉瓦尔，这是一个精灵语，意思是 \"霍尔韦尔的孩子\"。",
	"The elves of Aerenal have never allowed a half-elf into the Undying Court, and the Valenar elves don't consider half-elves capable of channeling a Valenar ancestral spirit. Among humans, though, half-elves don't experience any more prejudice or bias than members of other races, and some half-elves could easily be mistaken for human.": "艾瑞纳的精灵们从未允许半精灵进入不朽之庭，瓦伦纳的精灵们也不认为半精灵有能力引导瓦伦纳的祖先之魂。不过在人类中，半精灵不会比其他种族的成员经历更多的偏见或偏向，而且一些半精灵很容易被误认为是人类。",
	"In making a half-elf character, consider whether you were born in a Khoravar community, or if your parents were members of different races. Is your half-elf identity a source of pride, a simple fact of life, or something that has been difficult for you?": "在塑造半精灵角色时，要考虑你是否出生在霍拉瓦尔社区，或者你的父母是否是不同种族的成员。你的半精灵身份是你的骄傲，是生活中的一个简单事实，还是对你来说很困难的事情？",
	"The culture that has developed among Khorvaire's native half-elves places a strong emphasis on hospitality toward other Khoravar. They don't expect each other to put themselves in danger for strangers' sake, but when possible, half-elves do what they can to help others with information, shelter, and the like. Khoravar communities have weekly unity dinners where local news and events are shared; these meals are a great chance to hear about local events and opportunities.": "在霍尔韦尔本地的半精灵中形成的文化，非常强调对其他霍尔韦尔人的好客。他们不期望对方为了陌生人而把自己置于危险之中，但在可能的情况下，半精灵会尽其所能帮助他人，提供信息、住所等。Khoravar社区每周都会举行团结晚宴，分享当地的新闻和事件；这些晚宴是了解当地事件和机会的好机会。",
	"Many Khoravar espouse the idea of \"the bridge between,\" the notion that the Khoravar are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others are fascinated by their distant connection to the fey and seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become Greensinger druids or warlocks with Archfey patrons.": "许多霍拉瓦人信奉 \"桥梁 \"的理念，即霍拉瓦人被要求促进不同文化或物种成员之间的沟通与合作。遵循这一理念的霍拉瓦尔人往往成为吟游诗人、外交官、调解员或翻译。还有一些人对他们与精灵的遥远联系感到着迷，并试图在物质世界和Thelanis的精灵世界之间架起桥梁。这些霍拉瓦人通常会成为格林辛格德鲁伊或术士，拥有大帝的庇护。",
	"Khoravar speak both Common and Elvish, and among themselves they often blend these two together. This pidgin makes perfect sense to anyone who speaks both languages, but someone who speaks only one of them will miss some words and subtlety of meaning.": "霍拉瓦人既讲普通话又讲精灵语，他们之间经常将这两种语言混合在一起。这种混合语言对任何讲这两种语言的人来说都是非常有意义的，但只讲其中一种语言的人就会错过一些单词和微妙的含义。",
	"As you create a Khoravar character, you have a wide range of options to describe your backstory. The Khoravar Origin table can provide inspiration for it.": "当你创建一个霍拉瓦尔角色时，你有很多选择来描述你的背景故事。Khoravar起源表可以为其提供灵感。",

	"You are associated with House Lyrandar or House Medani, but you're more interested in the role the house plays in supporting Khoravar communities than in the work of its guilds.": "你与Lyrandar家族或Medani家族有联系，但你对该家族在支持Khoravar社区方面发挥的作用更感兴趣，而不是对其行会的工作感兴趣。",
	"You ride with the Valenar, hoping one day to prove that you are worthy of taking on a patron ancestor.": "你和瓦伦纳人一起骑马，希望有一天能证明你有资格担当守护神的祖先。",
	"Two dragonmarks appear among half-elf families: the Mark of Detection is found in House Medani and the Mark of Storm in House Lyrandar. Both houses were established families among the Khoravar by the time their dragonmarks appeared, and they remain pillars of the Khoravar's diverse culture. The Khoravar ideal of building bridges supports the work of both houses.": "有两个龙印出现在半精灵家族中：探测之印出现在Medani家族，风暴之印出现在Lyrandar家族。这两个家族在他们的龙印出现时，已经是霍拉瓦人中的知名家族，而且他们仍然是霍拉瓦多元文化的支柱。Khoravar的理想是建立桥梁，这支持了这两个家族的工作。",

	"The halflings of Eberron originate from eastern Khorvaire, and many nomadic tribes of halflings still travel the Talenta Plains. The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use.": "Eberron的半身人起源于Khorvaire东部，许多半身人的游牧部落仍然在Talenta平原旅行。龙纹在半身人中的出现刺激了他们在Khorvaire的缓慢迁移，随着最早的人类在大陆上的迁移，他们的治疗和款待服务也随之传播开来。现在，他们被发现在Khorvaire的每一个地方，把他们独特的才能用在这里。",
	"Lightfoot halflings are the more widespread halfling subrace, especially in the Talenta Plains, but stout halflings are found within nearly every halfling community.": "光脚半身人是比较普遍的半身人亚种，特别是在塔伦塔平原，但几乎在每个半身人社区都能发现粗壮的半身人。",
	"The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. Those few Talenta halflings who journey across Khorvaire are visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the strange ways of Khorvaire's cities and towns.": "在人类的陪伴下迁徙到霍尔韦尔的半身人，最终在衣着、举止和习俗上看起来非常像人类。他们留在塔伦塔平原的表兄妹，看起来几乎没有什么不同。在他们的家乡，半身人是游牧民族，他们骑着驯养的恐龙在广阔的平原上奔跑。那些穿越霍尔韦尔的少数塔伦塔半身人明显不合群，他们既吸引了好奇的目光，又对霍尔韦尔的城市和城镇的奇怪方式表达了大量的好奇心。",
	"As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.": "当你制作一个塔伦塔半身人角色时，请考虑一下你的角色为什么要离开开阔的平原。也许你在最后一次战争中担任了雇佣兵侦察员，你一直和你在冲突中遇到的战友在一起。也许你的部落被外敌消灭了，刺激你到更广阔的世界去寻找信息和复仇。你可能受到神灵的指引，他们向你发出低语和幻觉，引导你进行冒险。你可能是你的部落的官方特使，在世界范围内寻找盟友，或者只是被派去了解平原以外的土地。",
	"Also, consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halflings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur-like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs of your home remains strong.": "另外，考虑你与恐龙的关系，恐龙在塔伦塔半身人的生活中起着核心作用。你可以将你的法术和等级特征描绘成与恐龙有关：你可以有一个爪足同伴，拥有一个快活的形态，以恐龙的攻击方式命名你的战斗方式和动作，或者从滑翔翼（翼龙）图腾精神中获得灵感。或者你可以简单地戴上恐龙面具（就像许多塔伦塔半身人所做的那样），用过去的恐龙伙伴的爪子和牙齿来装饰自己，或者采取类似恐龙的举止。无论你在哪里旅行，你与你家乡的恐龙的联系仍然很紧密。",
	"Finally, it can be helpful to decide on a couple of behavioral quirks that reflect your culture. The Halfling Quirks table can provide some inspiration.": "最后，决定几个反映你的文化的行为怪癖可能会有帮助。半身人怪癖表可以提供一些灵感。",

	"You seek vengeance for a wrong done to your people.": "你为你的人民所遭受的错误寻求报复。",
	"You never forget an insult or injury.": "你永远不会忘记一个侮辱或伤害。",
	"You ascribe everything to the work of spirits.": "你把一切都归于精神的工作。",
	"Quick and charming, many halflings put their natural talents to use as bards, barristers, merchants, and politicians throughout Khorvaire. Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.": "敏捷而迷人，许多半身人把他们的天赋作为吟游诗人、大律师、商人和政治家在整个Khorvaire使用。当然，这些天赋对小偷、骗子和其他罪犯也同样有用。",
	"Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sharn, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of Stormreach. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point of contact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's group patron, as described later in this chapter.": "特别值得注意的是半身人经营的犯罪企业波洛玛家族，这是布雷兰最强大的犯罪集团。波罗玛家族的总部设在沙恩，但他们的影响力遍及全国，甚至延伸到遥远的风暴城。如果你决定扮演一个半身人流氓，或者一个有犯罪或江湖背景的角色，请考虑（与你的管理员一起）你是否与波洛玛尔家族有联系。你可以是一个自由职业者，偶尔会从波洛马族的老板那里得到工作。你可能有一个表弟在集团里，他偶尔会把你拉到犯罪事务中去。或者你甚至可能是一个Boromar领袖的不情愿的继承人；也许你已经逃跑了，而不是在犯罪帝国中占据你指定的位置，但你的过去可能还会追上你。你也可以是让波洛马氏族成为你的团体赞助人的联络人，如本章后面所述。",
	"Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the Mark of Healing in House Jorasco and House Ghallanda's Mark of Hospitality. Both marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same time that the elves of Aerenal received their first marks—centuries before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of House Ghallanda joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. There's actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the continent.": "有两个龙纹出现在霍尔韦尔的半身人中，即乔拉斯科家族的治愈之纹和加兰达家族的好客之纹。这两种龙纹都很古老，第一次出现在半身人中的时间与艾瑞纳尔的精灵获得他们的第一个龙纹的时间差不多--在人类到达科尔瓦尔的几个世纪之前。有时加兰达家族的半身人开玩笑说，他们的印记让他们为人类的到来做好了准备，让他们的新客人在科尔韦尔感到舒适。幽默中其实也有一些道理：两个半身人家族提供的服务都有助于人类在大陆上的传播。",
	"With its powers related to food and shelter, the Mark of Hospitality was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it allows House Ghallanda to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the Mark of Healing has always been a boon to both nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and House Jorasco still employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.": "凭借其与食物和住所有关的力量，好客的标志对早期的半身人游牧者来说是一个福音，但现在它使加兰达家族能够经营这片土地上最好的旅店、旅馆和酒馆。同样地，治疗的标记一直是游牧民族和定居者面对危险的荒野时的福音，乔拉斯科家族仍然采用魔法和世俗的治疗技术来照顾整个霍尔韦尔的病人的福祉。",
	"Dwarves are stoic. Elves are wise. Gnomes are cunning. And humans? They can't make up their mind, so they try to be all of these things at once.": "矮人是坚毅的。精灵是聪明的。侏儒是狡猾的。而人类呢？他们无法决定自己的想法，所以他们试图同时成为所有这些东西。",
	"The first human settlers came to Khorvaire about 3,000 years ago, landing in the area now known as the Lhazaar Principalities. From there, they began a slow but inexorable spread across the continent, disrupting the placid elven empire of Aerenal and leaving further ruined remnants of fallen Dhakaani goblin kingdoms in their wake. During this migration, they founded the settlements that would grow into the Five Nations. Even today humans make up the majority of the population in these countries. Despite their relatively short lifespans—or perhaps because of them—humans are innovative, adaptable, and aggressive, always pushing their limits and pursuing new ideas.": "第一批人类定居者大约在3000年前来到了Khorvaire，在现在被称为Lhazaar公国的地区登陆。从那里，他们开始缓慢但不可阻挡地蔓延到整个大陆，扰乱了平静的精灵帝国Aerenal，并在他们之后留下了更多堕落的达卡尼地精王国的废墟残骸。在这次迁徙中，他们建立了一些定居点，这些定居点后来发展成为五国。即使在今天，人类也占了这些国家人口的大多数。尽管他们的寿命相对较短，或者也许是因为他们的寿命，人类具有创新性、适应性和侵略性，总是在挑战自己的极限和追求新的想法。",
	"Humans prove extremely diverse; a barbarian from the Demon Wastes has little in common with a Brelish rogue. When creating a human character, consider where you're from and how that's reflected in your class and background. {@book Chapter 2|ERLW|5} presents an overview of the nations of Khorvaire and ideas for characters tied to those lands.

But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers.

But these exotic creatures aren't enough to satisfy the most innovative members of the house, leading to the practice of magebreeding. Using dragonshard focus items, Vadalis has found ways to create magical creatures. Typically, this results in a superior version of a creature—an animal that is stronger, faster, and smarter.

Lyrandar heirs help the Valenar elves run their young kingdom, and some believe that Valenar could become a true homeland for the Khoravar.": "对该家族的许多成员来说，该家族不仅仅是一个家庭或企业--它的私人岛屿飞地Stormhome是他们最接近祖国的东西。埃斯拉瓦什男爵雄心勃勃，经常引导家族按照她认为的所有半精灵的利益行事。Lyrandar的继承人帮助Valenar精灵管理他们年轻的王国，有些人认为Valenar可以成为Khoravar的真正家园。",

	"If you want to keep something safe—jewels, secrets, prisoners—Kundarak is there to help. The Defenders Guild of House Kundarak trains locksmiths, security specialists, and more. It maintains the prison of Dreadhold, along with a number of smaller prisons. As useful as these services are, it's the Banking Guild that truly defines the house. Kundarak's lands in the Mror Holds include deep veins of precious metals, which the dwarves used to establish the banking industry of Khorvaire. Anyone who makes a living from coin—from bankers to goldsmiths—likely learned their skills at House Kundarak. The security of banks bearing the Kundarak manticore emblem is legendary. The house also provides a special service to those who can afford it: a system of extradimensional vaults, allowing a client to store their goods in one location and retrieve them at any other Kundarak enclave.": "如果你想保护一些东西--珠宝、秘密、囚犯--昆达拉克会提供帮助。昆达拉克家族的保卫者公会培训锁匠、安全专家等等。它维护着Dreadhold的监狱，以及一些较小的监狱。尽管这些服务很有用，但银行公会才是真正定义了这个家族。昆达拉克在莫罗港的土地上有很深的贵金属矿脉，矮人利用这些矿脉建立了霍尔韦尔的银行业。任何以钱币为生的人--从银行家到金匠--都可能在昆达拉克家族学到他们的技能。带有昆达拉克尾兽徽章的银行的安全性是传奇性的。该银行还为那些负担得起的人提供一项特殊服务：一个超维金库系统，允许客户将他们的货物储存在一个地方，并在任何其他昆达拉克飞地取回。",
	"House Kundarak has a close alliance with House Sivis. Like the House of Scribing, Kundarak has worked to earn the trust of its clients and to establish a reputation for unshakable integrity.

Aberrant marks often appear when people from different dragonmarked families produce a child, and for this reason such unions are forbidden by the Twelve. But aberrant dragonmarks can appear on members of any race, at any age, regardless of bloodline. No two aberrant dragonmarks are exactly alike—even if they grant the same power, they might manifest in different ways.": "十二种龙纹是可预测的，它们的力量一般是建设性的。但还有一种龙纹，对持有者和他们周围的人都很危险。当来自不同龙纹家族的人产生一个孩子时，往往会出现反常的龙纹，由于这个原因，这种结合被十二龙纹所禁止。但是，反常的龙印可以出现在任何种族的成员身上，在任何年龄段，无论血统如何。没有两个异常龙印是完全相同的--即使它们赋予同样的力量，也可能以不同的方式表现出来。",

	"Aberrant marks are feared for another reason, too. Long ago, aberrant marks were more common and some held great powers. Aberrant leader Halas Tarkanan could devastate cities with powerful earthquakes. The Lady of the Plague wielded disease and commanded hordes of vermin. The dragonmarked houses united in an inquisition called the War of the Mark. Some say this was a persecution of innocents, but most feared the aberrants and stood by as the houses hunted them down. Following the War of the Mark, aberrant dragonmarks were few in number and relatively weak. But since the Mourning, aberrant marks have been appearing in greater numbers.": "反常的印记也因为另一个原因而被人害怕。很久以前，反常的印记比较普遍，有些印记拥有强大的力量。反常者领袖哈拉斯-塔卡南（Halas Tarkanan）可以用强大的地震摧毁城市。瘟疫之女挥舞着疾病，指挥着成群的害虫。有龙纹的家族联合起来进行了一场名为 \"龙纹战争 \"的宗教裁判。有人说这是对无辜者的迫害，但大多数人都害怕异教徒，在各家族追捕他们时袖手旁观。马克战争之后，异常龙印的数量很少，而且相对较弱。但自从哀悼会之后，异常龙纹的数量越来越多。",

	"Even a patron that isn't heavy-handed can significantly motivate your group. Maybe you'll seek adventures based on what pleases your patron and so earn a reward.

	"Beyond the benefits described in each group patron's description, patrons can also grant additional favors. If your party is in good standing with your patron—proving yourselves reliable agents who fulfill the group's goals—your patron might grant requests for additional favors. A favor might take a variety of forms appropriate to the patron's area of influence or expertise, such as small loans, specialized equipment, or access to people and places you wouldn't otherwise have. Patrons who you regularly find yourself in conflict with aren't likely to grant you favors, unless doing so directly furthers their goals.": "除了每个团体赞助人描述的好处外，赞助人还可以给予额外的好处。如果你的党派与你的赞助人有良好的关系--证明你们是可靠的代理人，能实现团体的目标--你的赞助人可能会批准额外的好处请求。恩惠可以采取各种形式，适合赞助人的影响力或专业知识，如小额贷款、专门设备，或接触你无法接触的人和地方。那些经常与你发生冲突的赞助人不可能给你好处，除非这样做能直接促进他们的目标。",

	"For certain kinds of organizations, you can either join an existing group or found your own.

	"The information in this section applies whether you join an organization or found your own. When you're the boss, some of the benefits of belonging to an organization become expenses you have to worry about; when you run your own mercenary company, for example, you need to stock your own armory rather than drawing on an existing organization's stockpile. The organization brings in income, but you'll have to spend some of it to keep the organization running.": "无论你是加入一个组织还是建立自己的组织，本节中的信息都适用。当你是老板时，属于一个组织的一些好处变成了你必须担心的开支；例如，当你经营自己的雇佣兵公司时，你需要储备自己的军械库，而不是从现有组织的库存中获取。组织带来了收入，但你必须花费其中的一部分来维持组织的运行。",

	"Typically, an adventuring group has no particular contact within the larger guild. There's a local leader or bookkeeper who collects dues, but otherwise you might interact with a variety of different members of the guild in different contexts—when looking for a contract, gathering referrals, staying in the guildhall, and so on. The Guild Contact table provides inspiration for contacts you might encounter during any given encounter with your adventurer's guild.": "通常情况下，一个冒险团在大的行会中没有特别的联系。有一个当地的领导或簿记员负责收取会费，但除此之外，你可能会在不同的情况下与公会的不同成员打交道--在寻找合同、收集推荐人、住在公会大厅等等。公会联系人表提供了你在与冒险者公会的任何特定接触中可能遇到的联系人的灵感。",

	"A hardened adventurer who thinks a moral compass is akin to a pair of manacles": "一个顽强的冒险家，认为道德指南针类似于一副手铐",

	"A grouchy employee who keeps the guildhall clean and cares for its guests while quietly complaining about how adventurers should \"grow up,\" get a \"real job,\" and contribute to society": "脾气暴躁的员工，保持公会的清洁，照顾客人，同时悄悄地抱怨冒险者应该如何 \"长大\"，得到一份 \"真正的工作\"，并为社会做出贡献。",

	"Among its various services, the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild offers a launchpad for all manner of adventures. Potential employers bring all manner of work to the guildhall, posting messages or seeking out those with specific fields of expertise. Guild members also relate news about opportunities via word of mouth. Such jobs might resemble those assigned by any other patron. Without a patron directing your assignments, your group is free to pursue its own goals, whether you're seeking wealth, struggling against evil, pursuing a personal vendetta, or simply reacting to disastrous events around you. The Guild Adventures table refers to the descriptions of other patrons in this section; your DM can use the adventure ideas in those descriptions to flesh out job opportunities available through your guild.": "在其各种服务中，悬崖顶冒险者公会为各种形式的冒险提供了一个启动平台。潜在的雇主将各种工作带到公会，发布信息或寻找具有特定专业领域的人。公会成员也通过口耳相传的方式传递有关机会的消息。这些工作可能类似于其他赞助人分配的工作。没有赞助人指导你的任务，你的团体可以自由地追求自己的目标，无论你是在寻求财富，与邪恶斗争，追求个人仇恨，或只是对周围的灾难性事件作出反应。公会冒险表参考了本节中对其他赞助人的描述；你的DM可以使用这些描述中的冒险想法来充实通过你的公会提供的工作机会。",

	"In any of these cases, the potential employer might represent an established organization (a crime syndicate or university, for example) or might be independent like your party. In the latter case, there's always the possibility that you could end up competing with an organization—running up against a crime syndicate while pursuing a criminal job, perhaps, or competing with university researchers to plunder a ruin. This competition might turn into a rivalry, or it could evolve into employment, with the crime syndicate or university recognizing your talent and becoming your patron.": "在任何一种情况下，潜在的雇主可能代表一个既定的组织（例如犯罪集团或大学），也可能像你们党一样是独立的。在后一种情况下，你总是有可能最终与一个组织竞争--也许是在追求犯罪工作时与犯罪集团竞争，或者与大学研究人员竞争掠夺一个遗迹。这种竞争可能变成竞争，也可能演变成就业，犯罪集团或大学承认你的才能并成为你的赞助人。",
	"Few guilds besides the Clifftop guild are widely known, but the following organizations have carved out reputations for themselves:": "除了悬崖顶公会之外，很少有公会广为人知，但以下组织已经为自己开辟了名声。",
	"{@b Deathsgate Explorers' Club}. Named for the lower-class district in Sharn where it maintains its guildhall, the Deathsgate Explorers' Club is a rough-and-tumble guild made up largely of Last War veterans. Deathsgaters rarely undertake adventures from altruistic motives, demanding prompt payment or other reciprocal arrangements. They have a fierce rivalry with the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild.": "{@b Deathsgate Explorers' Club}. 死亡之门探险家俱乐部以其所在的沙恩下层地区命名，是一个主要由最后一次战争的老兵组成的粗犷的公会。死亡之门的人很少出于无私的动机进行冒险，他们要求迅速付款或其他互惠的安排。他们与克利夫托普冒险家协会有着激烈的竞争关系。",
	"{@b Wayfinder Foundation}. Founded by a renowned hunter and explorer, Lord Boroman ir'Dayne, the Wayfinder Foundation is an exclusive adventurers' guild that welcomes only experienced and renowned members. Dayne suffers from a wasting curse that prevents him from undertaking further adventures of his own, so he has put his considerable fortune to use in sponsoring great expeditions. The Wayfinder Foundation has an unusually wide reach for an adventurers' guild, with guildhalls found across Khorvaire as well as in the city of Stormreach, in Xen'drik. Its headquarters, and the residence of its wealthy patron, is in Fairhaven.": "{@b Wayfinder Foundation}. 寻路者基金会由著名的猎人和探险家博罗曼-伊尔-戴恩勋爵创立，是一个独特的冒险者公会，只欢迎有经验的著名成员。戴恩患有一种消耗性的诅咒，这种诅咒使他无法再进行自己的冒险，所以他把他的大量财富用于赞助伟大的探险活动。作为一个冒险家协会，探路者基金会的活动范围异常广泛，在整个霍尔韦尔以及Xen'drik的Stormreach市都有行会馆。它的总部，也是其富有的赞助人的住所，位于费尔海文。",
	"Your group is a team of crooks that's part of an organized crime syndicate. You're more talented and have a wider range of skills than most thugs and burglars, so your crew might be entrusted with more important tasks than simply roughing up local merchants or breaking into empty apartments. If you're anything like a typical adventuring party, you bring a combination of powerful magic, physical might, and a broad selection of skills to your work, making you well suited to missions like grand heists, high-profile assassinations, and epic cons.": "你的团队是一个属于有组织犯罪集团的骗子团队。你比大多数暴徒和窃贼更有天赋，拥有更广泛的技能，所以你的团队可能被委托执行更重要的任务，而不是简单地粗暴对待当地的商人或闯入空荡荡的公寓。如果你像一个典型的冒险队伍一样，你会把强大的魔法、身体的力量和广泛的技能结合起来，使你很适合执行像大抢劫、高调的暗杀和史诗般的骗局等任务。",
	"Crime syndicates thrived during the Last War. The war left many people desperate, driving them into lives of crime. The war also demanded huge numbers of able-bodied soldiers, which reduced the ranks of law enforcement across Khorvaire. As a result, most settlements have some organized criminal element, ranging from small local thieves' guilds to international organizations with dozens of interconnected branches.": "犯罪集团在最后一次战争期间蓬勃发展。战争使许多人感到绝望，促使他们走上犯罪的道路。战争还需要大量的精壮的士兵，这使得整个霍尔韦尔的执法队伍减少。因此，大多数定居点都有一些有组织的犯罪因素，从小型的地方盗贼行会到拥有几十个相互联系的分支机构的国际组织。",
	"As much as some members of the Sharn Council and the Watch would like to see the Boromars disbanded, the syndicate is unlikely to collapse any time soon.": "尽管沙恩委员会和守望先锋的一些成员很想看到博罗玛人被解散，但这个集团不太可能很快就会崩溃。",
	"The core membership of the Boromar Clan—comprising about one in six of its members—is an extended family of halflings descended from immigrants who came to Sharn from the Talenta Plains. Another third of the members are unrelated halflings, and the rest belong to other species. The syndicate employs a wide variety of bookkeepers and administrators as well as burglars, con artists, smugglers, and other criminals. When a situation calls for physical violence, the Boromars usually hire freelancers—members of the Sharn Guard or agents of House Tarkanan. The Boromar family proper has a team of personal bodyguards called the Clawfoots, who are mostly fierce halfling warriors recently relocated from the Talenta Plains. They primarily defend Boromar holdings and headquarters in the halfling district of Little Plains.": "Boromar氏族的核心成员--约占其成员总数的六分之一--是一个半身人的大家庭，他们是来自塔伦塔平原的移民的后代。另外三分之一的成员是没有血缘关系的半身人，其余的属于其他物种。该集团雇佣了各种各样的簿记员和行政人员，以及窃贼、骗子、走私者和其他罪犯。当需要使用暴力的时候，波洛玛家族通常会雇佣自由职业者--沙恩卫队的成员或塔卡南家族的代理人。波罗玛家族有一队私人保镖，叫做 \"爪足\"，他们大多是最近从塔伦塔平原迁来的凶猛的半身人战士。他们主要保卫博罗玛的财产和位于小平原的半身人区的总部。",
	"The Boromar Clan has a reputation for omnipotence that makes even the forces of law and order in Sharn hesitant to cross it. It's far safer to be an ally of the syndicate, or at least to stay out of its way, than it is to be its enemy—and it's more lucrative to boot. The following groups count themselves among the Boromar Clan's closest allies:": "Boromar家族有一个无所不能的名声，甚至让沙恩的法律和秩序力量都对它犹豫不决。成为该集团的盟友，或者至少不受其影响，要比成为其敌人安全得多，而且更有利可图。以下团体是波罗马家族最亲密的盟友之一。",
	"{@b Sharn Council}. Of the seventeen members of Sharn's city council, four have close ties to the Boromar Clan—including one, Ilyra Boromar, who reports directly to the head of the syndicate. These four vote as a bloc to ensure that the council doesn't take direct action against the Boromars, while enough of the other council members fear the syndicate that they tend to carry the vote. A member of the Boromar Clan can call in a favor to secure an audience with one of these councilors, though such does not guarantee aid.": "{@b Sharn Council}. 在沙恩市议会的17名成员中，有4人与波洛玛家族关系密切--包括一个叫伊拉-波洛玛的人，他直接向集团的负责人汇报。这四个人作为一个集团投票，以确保议会不对波洛玛家族采取直接行动，而其他议会成员对集团有足够的恐惧，所以他们倾向于进行投票。波罗玛氏族的成员可以通过求助来确保与这些理事之一会面，但这并不能保证得到援助。",
	"{@b Sharn Watch}. The Boromars have been bribing captains of the Sharn Watch for generations. What's more, if the Boromar Clan collapsed, the underworld would erupt in anarchy as dozens of petty crime lords fought for territory and position. As a result, a member of the Boromars can call in a favor to get minor criminal charges dismissed.": "{@b Sharn Watch}. 波罗玛人世代都在贿赂沙恩观察站的队长。更重要的是，如果波洛玛尔家族垮台，黑社会将爆发无政府状态，因为几十个小犯罪头目为了争夺地盘和地位而大打出手。因此，波洛玛尔家族的成员可以叫人帮忙，使轻微的刑事指控被撤销。",
	"Despite the Boromar Clan's position of strength in Sharn, it has many foes, and their unrelenting assaults have put the syndicate in what might be its most precarious position ever. Currently, the following groups pose the greatest threats to Boromar interests:": "尽管波罗马家族在沙恩的地位很强，但它有很多敌人，他们无情的攻击使该集团处于可能是有史以来最危险的境地。目前，以下团体对波罗马的利益构成了最大的威胁。",
	"{@b Daask}. The monstrous criminal guild called Daask, a pawn of the leaders of Droaam, has started launching violent raids against Boromar holdings over the last two years. A mobile organization using guerrilla tactics, Daask has managed to circumvent Boromar security and avoid serious reprisals for a range of violent thefts and sabotages. Agents of Daask go out of their way to harm up-and-coming Boromar agents.": "{@b Daask}. 被称为Daask的畸形犯罪行会是Droaam领导人的棋子，在过去两年中开始对Boromar的财产发动暴力袭击。作为一个使用游击战术的流动组织，Daask已经成功地绕过了Boromar的安全，并避免了一系列暴力盗窃和破坏行为的严重报复。达斯克的特工不顾一切地伤害新晋的Boromar特工。",
	"{@b Sharn Council}. Despite four friends on the city council, the Boromar Clan has several enemies as well. At least three councilors oppose the Boromars because of genuine concern for their constituents; two more oppose the syndicate because they're part of rival organizations (the Aurum and the Tyrants). Because of their influence, the council has so far refused to devote any resources to combating the rise of Daask, hoping the monstrous guild will bring down the Boromars. Individual members of the Boromar Clan can be sure that these councilors will oppose any petition they might bring to the council.": "{@b Sharn Council}. 尽管市议会中有四个朋友，但波罗马家族也有几个敌人。至少有三位议员因为真正关心他们的选民而反对Boromars；还有两位议员因为是敌对组织（Aurum和Tyrants）的成员而反对该集团。由于他们的影响力，议会至今拒绝投入任何资源来打击达斯克的崛起，希望这个畸形的行会能打倒波罗马人。波罗玛氏族的个别成员可以确信，这些议员会反对他们可能提交给议会的任何请愿书。",
	"With a crime syndicate as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "如果有一个犯罪集团作为你的团体的赞助人，你会获得以下好处。",
	"The annual Tain Gala, as everyone knows, brings the wealthiest and most prominent citizens of Sharn together in a grand display of opulence and power. But last night, it also provided a shocking display of violence, as Saidan Boromar—head of the Boromar family, which is allegedly tied to all manner of criminal activities throughout the city—was confronted by a would-be assassin (whose name will not be made public until her next of kin have been identified and notified). Boromar and his wife, Mala Boromar d'Jorasco, escaped unharmed thanks to the timely intervention of their bodyguard, a recent immigrant from the Talenta Plains whose fascinating culture and fierce demeanor were both in plain view last night. A Boromar spokesperson identified the bodyguard as Halak Boromar, head of the Clawfoots—the Boromar family's personal guard, named for the dinosaurs ridden by halflings in the Talenta Plains.": "众所周知，一年一度的泰恩盛会将沙恩最富有和最有名望的公民聚集在一起，隆重展示财富和权力。但昨晚，它也提供了一个令人震惊的暴力展示，因为赛丹-博罗玛--博罗玛家族的首领，据称与整个城市的各种犯罪活动有关--被一个可能的刺客（在她的近亲被确认和通知之前，她的名字不会被公开）撞见。博罗玛和他的妻子玛拉-博罗玛-乔拉斯科（Mala Boromar d'Jorasco）安然无恙，这要归功于他们的保镖的及时干预，他是来自塔伦塔平原的新移民，其迷人的文化和凶狠的举止都在昨晚一览无余。波洛马的发言人指出，这位保镖名叫哈拉克-波洛马，是波洛马家族的私人护卫队队长，以塔伦塔平原上半身人骑的恐龙命名。",
	"{@b Contraband}. You have access to your syndicate's \"business\" of dealing with contraband, such as poisons or narcotics. You don't receive a discount on these goods, but you can always find someplace to purchase them.": "{@b Contraband}. 你可以进入你的辛迪加的 \"业务\"，处理违禁品，如毒药或麻醉品。你在这些货物上得不到折扣，但你总能找到地方购买它们。",
	"{@b Fences}. Members or associates of your syndicate are skilled at disposing of stolen goods, and you have access to this service as well. Fences are useful for selling not just illicit goods but also expensive items such as works of art and even magic items. In the case of magic items, this allows you to delegate the work of finding a buyer (a downtime activity described in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} and {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}) to the fence. The drawback is that you don't get to choose whether to accept the offer you might receive—the fence makes that call for you.": "{@b Fences}. 你的集团成员或同伙擅长处理赃物，你也可以使用这项服务。栅栏不仅对出售非法货物很有用，而且对出售昂贵的物品，如艺术品甚至魔法物品也很有用。就魔法物品而言，这允许你将寻找买家的工作（在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}和{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}中描述的停机活动）委托给围栏。缺点是，你不能选择是否接受你可能收到的报价--栅栏为你做了这个决定。",
	"{@b Immunity}. As a member of the Boromar Clan, you are protected from other members of the clan. No one in your syndicate targets you for their own criminal operations. (Of course, the same is expected of you.) On the other hand, if you have rivals within the clan, they might find other ways to interfere with your activities.": "{@b Immunity}. 作为波洛马氏族的成员，你受到保护，不受该氏族其他成员的影响。你的集团中没有人以你为目标进行他们自己的犯罪活动。(当然，对你也是如此。）另一方面，如果你在氏族内有对手，他们可能会找到其他方法来干扰你的活动。",
	"Naturally, a large portion of the Boromar Clan's members come from a criminal background. There's no reason characters with other backgrounds can't be part of the syndicate, though. The Boromars recruit ex-soldiers as muscle, trained sages for research, sailors to crew smuggling vessels, and charlatans and urchins for their unique talents. Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:": "自然，博洛玛家族的大部分成员都有犯罪背景。不过，没有理由其他背景的人物不能成为该集团的一员。波罗玛人招募退役士兵作为肌肉，招募训练有素的圣人进行研究，招募水手作为走私船的船员，招募江湖骗子和顽童以发挥他们的独特才能。考虑在你的队伍中扮演这些角色中的一部分或全部。",
	"{@b Bruiser}. Sometimes subtlety means breaking just one of a snitch's kneecaps. The Bruiser uses force and the threat of force to make sure that the crime syndicate gets what it wants. Strength is a natural prerequisite for the role, but Charisma can also be useful, especially when combined with proficiency in {@skill Intimidation} to reinforce the danger inherent in the Bruiser's presence. Plenty of Bruisers have a criminal past, but former soldiers are often recruited into this role as well. Fighters and rogues make natural Bruisers.": "{@b Bruiser}. 有时微妙的做法意味着只需打破一个告密者的膝盖骨。恶棍使用武力和武力威胁来确保犯罪集团得到它想要的东西。力量是这个角色的先决条件，但魅力也是有用的，特别是当与精通{@skill Intimidation}相结合时，可以加强布鲁斯的内在危险。很多布鲁斯人都有犯罪的过去，但前士兵也经常被招募到这个角色。战士和流氓是天然的布鲁斯人。",
	"{@b Burglar}. Agile and nimble, the Burglar relies on Dexterity and proficiency in skills such as {@skill Acrobatics}, {@skill Sleight of Hand}, and {@skill Stealth} to get in to a target location, take valuables, and get out without being noticed. Some Burglars specialize in certain types of theft, such as housebreaking or picking pockets. Besides characters with the criminal background, young urchins often find a place in criminal syndicates by filling this role. Rogues are natural Burglars, but anyone else with the right combination of skills and abilities can do the job.": "{@b Burglar}. 敏捷和灵活，盗贼依靠灵巧和熟练的技能，如{@skill Acrobatics}、{@skill Sleight of Hand}和{@skill Stealth}，进入目标地点，拿走贵重物品，然后不被发现地离开。有些盗贼专门从事某些类型的盗窃，如破门而入或扒窃口袋。除了有犯罪背景的人物，年轻的顽童经常通过扮演这个角色在犯罪集团中找到一席之地。罗格是天生的盗贼，但其他任何拥有正确技能和能力组合的人都可以做这项工作。",
	"{@b Mastermind}. Somebody has to be the brains of any criminal operation—that's where the Mastermind comes in. A high Intelligence benefits this character, as does proficiency in skills such as {@skill Insight} and {@skill Investigation}. Masterminds often come from backgrounds such as acolyte, noble, or sage, that give them a broad range of knowledge to support their schemes. Bards, rogues, and wizards are often drawn to this role.": "{@b Mastermind}. 任何犯罪活动都必须有人负责，这就是主谋的作用。高智力对这个人物有利，熟练掌握{@skill Insight}和{@skill Investigation}等技能也是如此。策划者通常来自于圣徒、贵族或贤者等背景，这使他们拥有广泛的知识来支持他们的计划。吟游诗人、流氓和巫师经常被吸引到这个角色。",
	"{@b Safecracker}. The \"breaking\" part of \"breaking and entering\" is the Safecracker's job. A typical Safecracker might have proficiency with thieves' tools, as well as the Dexterity required to use them expertly. Intelligence can be important for figuring out complicated locks and secret doors. Many Safecrackers also boast a high Strength for those cases where lockpicks fail. Safecrackers often come from criminal backgrounds, but characters with experience using other tools and devices, including guild artisans and even sailors, also fall naturally into this role. Artificer or rogue makes a natural class choice for the Safecracker.": "{@b Safecracker}. 破门而入 \"中的 \"破门 \"部分是安全窃贼的工作。一个典型的盗贼可能会熟练掌握盗贼的工具，以及熟练使用这些工具所需的灵巧能力。智力对于弄清复杂的锁和秘密的门很重要。许多安全钳工还拥有很高的实力，以应对锁具失效的情况。安全钳工通常有犯罪背景，但有使用其他工具和设备经验的人物，包括行会工匠甚至水手，也会自然而然地进入这个角色。工匠或流氓是安全钳工的自然等级选择。",
	"Your work as syndicate members involves more than simple street swindles or pickpocketing. A team with your skills comes together for greater purposes—more dangerous risks and far more splendid rewards. As a group, consider the options on the Syndicate Crimes table and work with your DM to decide what kinds of work you do for the Boromar Clan.": "作为集团成员，你们的工作不仅仅涉及简单的街头诈骗或扒窃。一个拥有你的技能的团队会为了更伟大的目标而聚在一起--更危险的风险和更丰厚的回报。作为一个团体，考虑一下 \"辛迪加犯罪 \"表中的选项，并与你的DM一起决定你为波罗马家族做哪些工作。",
	"{@b Acquisitions and Retrieval}. Your job is to acquire assets for the syndicate. You might steal important documents or clear out a location for use as a hideout.": "{@b Acquisitions and Retrieval}. 你的工作是为该集团获取资产。你可能会偷取重要的文件，或者清理出一个地点作为藏身之处。",
	"{@b Heists}. You plan and execute elaborate robberies that require the skills of everyone on your team.": "{@b Heists}. 你计划并执行精心设计的抢劫案，需要你团队中每个人的技能。",
	"{@b Gang Warfare}. Your primary job is to ensure that no other crime syndicate (such as Daask or House Tarkanan) gains a significant foothold in your territory.": "{@b Gang Warfare}. 你的主要工作是确保没有其他犯罪集团（如Daask或Tarkanan家族）在你的领土上获得一个重要的立足点。",
	"{@b Internal Affairs}. Your task is to keep all the corrupt, headstrong, and avaricious members of your syndicate in line with the goals and rules of the group.": "{@b Internal Affairs}. 你的任务是让你的集团中所有腐败的、刚愎自用的、贪婪的成员与集团的目标和规则保持一致。",
	"{@b Assassination}. Your work involves killing prominent people—the sort who have numerous bodyguards and elaborate security systems to circumvent.": "{@b Assassination}. 你的工作涉及杀戮知名人士--那种有众多保镖和精心设计的安全系统可以规避的人。",
	"{@b Topple the Powerful}. Your syndicate might be criminal and your methods illegal, but your goals are righteous. You help people who are powerless to defend themselves against exploitation by the rich and powerful.": "{@b Topple the Powerful}. 你的集团可能是犯罪，你的方法是非法的，但你的目标是正义的。你帮助那些无力保护自己免受富人和权贵剥削的人。",
	"Even among the notorious Boromar Clan, your group has a distinct identity and a reputation. What's the event or unique trait that makes your crew stand out? Consult the Group Infamy table for suggestions on how your group might stand out within the larger syndicate.": "即使在臭名昭著的波罗马家族中，你们的团队也有一个独特的身份和声誉。是什么事件或独特的特质让你的团队脱颖而出？请参考团体恶名表，看看你的团体如何在更大的集团中脱颖而出。",
	"{@b Tattoos}. Each member of your group has a distinct tattoo that inspires fear in others. When possible, you use the symbol as a calling card to mark your work.": "{@b Tattoos}. 你们小组的每个成员都有一个独特的纹身，能激发别人的恐惧。在可能的情况下，你用这个符号作为名片来标记你的工作。",
	"{@b Outfit}. Whether it is a leather duster with a group symbol or a distinctive handkerchief tucked in your pocket, your gang has a signature accessory.": "{@b Outfit}. 无论是带有团体标志的皮革掸子，还是塞在口袋里的独特手帕，你的团伙都有一个标志性的配件。",
	"{@b Infamy}. Your group is linked to an infamous crime, one that remains the talk of the town.": "{@b Infamy}. 你的团体与一起臭名昭著的犯罪有关，这起犯罪仍然是镇上的话题。",
	"{@b Idols}. A certain type of person finds criminals alluring, and your band has acquired a group of such hangers-on. They're not criminals themselves, just outsiders who admire you for your brutality, cunning, or flair.": "{@b Idols}. 某种类型的人觉得罪犯很诱人，而你的乐队已经获得了一群这样的挂靠者。他们本身不是罪犯，只是因为你的残暴、狡猾或天赋而钦佩你的外人。",
	"{@b Legitimate}. The Boromar Clan has a legitimate front, though everyone knows the truth behind it. You're part of that facade of legitimacy, but you have a reputation for getting away with (literal) murder.": "{@b Legitimate}. Boromar家族有一个合法的幌子，尽管每个人都知道它背后的真相。你是这个合法幌子的一部分，但你有逃脱（字面）谋杀的声誉。",
	"{@b Legends}. You have an air of mystery, and people whisper that you command strange powers. True or not, this reputation keeps people out of your way.": "{@b Legends}. 你有一种神秘的气息，人们低声说你拥有奇怪的力量。不管是真是假，这种声誉使人们对你敬而远之。",
	"Some criminals believe you can't do a job without betraying your partners. Perhaps you have your own share of adversaries you've angered. The Group Rivals table presents a host of groups and individuals who might—legitimately or otherwise—hold a grudge against you.": "一些罪犯认为，你不背叛你的伙伴就无法完成工作。也许你也有自己的对手被你激怒。团体对手表列出了许多团体和个人，他们可能--合法的或其他的--对你怀有怨恨。",
	"{@b The Law}. Someone in the Sharn Watch has vowed to put you in prison or die trying.": "{@b The Law}. 沙恩观察的某个人发誓要把你送进监狱，否则就得死。",
	"{@b Gang War}. Some members of a rival syndicate (such as Daask, House Tarkanan, or the Tyrants) hate you, probably for good reason.": "{@b Gang War}. 敌对集团的一些成员（如达斯克、塔卡南家族或暴君）讨厌你，可能有充分的理由。",

In any case, the Syndicate Contact table can help you define the personality of this contact.": "每个人在波洛马氏族的等级制度中都有一个明确的位置。你向一个监督你工作的联系人报告，给你分配任务，并收取集团的分成。这个人可能是一个计划你所有行动的犯罪主谋，或者他们可以把计划留给你的小组。在任何情况下，辛迪加联系人表可以帮助你定义这个联系人的个性。",

The Boromar Clan is one crime syndicate, while the others include the following groups:": "沙恩市的不寻常之处在于，它是不少于四个强大的集团的家，而这些集团不知为何还没有设法消灭对方。波洛马氏族是一个犯罪集团，而其他集团包括以下几个。",
	"Imagine it: a long-lasting state of euphoria, a feeling of power and energy, a measurable impact on certain magical powers, and the risk of addiction and deadly overdose with every use. That's the thrill of the drug called dragon's blood, which currently enjoys skyrocketing popularity in Sharn. Every day the death toll from this mysterious substance rises among \"blood addicts.\" And no wonder, as it's produced in Droaam and sold in drams or \"veins\" by the monstrous thugs of Daask, who surely seek nothing less than to destroy the prosperity of Sharn but targeting its most precious resource: its sober, hardworking people. Remember friends, \"Stay on the wagon. Say NO to dragon!\"": "想象一下：一种持久的兴奋状态，一种力量和能量的感觉，对某些魔力有可衡量的影响，以及每次使用都有上瘾和致命的过量风险。这就是被称为龙血的药物所带来的快感，它目前在沙恩享有极高的人气。每天，这种神秘物质造成的死亡人数在 \"血瘾者 \"中不断上升。这也难怪，因为它产自德拉姆，由达斯克的畸形暴徒以德拉姆或 \"静脉 \"的形式出售，他们肯定只想破坏沙恩的繁荣，但目标是它最宝贵的资源：它清醒、勤劳的人民。记住朋友们，\"留在马车上。对龙说不！\"",
	"{@b Daask}. Daask is an aggressive criminal organization with cells across Khorvaire. Led by monstrous immigrants from Droaam—gnolls, harpies, medusas, minotaurs, ogres, trolls, and others—the group is ultimately under the command of Sora Katra, one of the rulers of Droaam. Physical violence is its specialty, but Daask also dabbles in illegal drugs.": "{@b Daask}. 达斯克（Daask）是一个咄咄逼人的犯罪组织，在霍尔韦尔各地都有分部。该组织由来自德拉姆（Droaam）的畸形移民领导，其中包括巨魔、女妖、梅杜莎人、牛头人、食人魔、巨魔等，最终受德拉姆统治者之一索拉-卡特拉（Sora Katra）的指挥。身体暴力是其专长，但达斯克也涉足非法毒品。",
	"{@b House Tarkanan}. House Tarkanan is known as a small order of highly skilled assassins and thieves in Sharn. Less well known is the fact that this guild consists primarily of criminals who bear aberrant dragonmarks—hence its choice of namesake, as Lord Halas Tarkanan united the bearers of these marks during the ancient War of the Mark.": "{@b House Tarkanan}. 塔卡南家族是沙恩的一个由高技能刺客和盗贼组成的小团体。鲜为人知的是，这个公会主要由带有异常龙纹的罪犯组成--因此它选择了这个名字，因为哈拉斯-塔卡南勋爵在古代的龙纹战争中联合了这些龙纹的持有者。",
	"{@b The Tyrants}. The Tyrants are a mysterious group of shapeshifters who traffic in all manner of information. They sell secrets, blackmail powerful people, and forge everything from identification papers to coins and works of art.": "{@b The Tyrants}. 暴君们是一个神秘的变身者团体，他们贩卖各种信息。他们出售秘密，勒索有权势的人，并伪造从身份证明文件到硬币和艺术品的一切。",
	"Your group works for one of the most influential organizations in Khorvaire: the dragonmarked houses. Whether or not any member of your group carries a dragonmark or is even related to one of the houses by blood, you act on behalf of a house to advance its interests.

	"The thirteen dragonmarked houses are described in detail earlier in this chapter.": "本章前面详细介绍了这十三座龙纹屋。",
	"With a dragonmarked house as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "如果有一个龙纹屋作为你的团体的守护者，你会获得以下好处。",

On average, the house pays each member of your group an amount equal to 10 gp × the average level of your characters per day you spend on the mission.": "{@b Compensation}. 你的庇护所为你所做的工作支付你。平均来说，家族会支付给你们每个成员一笔相当于10GP×你们的角色平均等级的金额，每一天你们都会花在任务上。",
	"{@b Independence}. Each member of your group is issued papers that identifies you as agents of your patron house. Because the dragonmarked houses are bound to political neutrality by the terms of the ancient Korth Edicts, these papers guarantee you the right to travel freely across national borders on the business of your patron house. (If you assert that you are on the business of the house, even if you aren't, border agents are unlikely to challenge you.)": "{@b Independence}. 你们小组的每个成员都会获得证件，以表明你们是你们守护家族的代理人。因为有龙纹的家族受古老的科思法令条款的约束而保持政治中立，这些证件保证你有权为你的守护家族的业务而自由穿越国境。 如果你声称你是为家族的业务而来，即使你不是，边境人员也不可能质疑你。",
	"Dragonmarked houses employ adventurers who suit their needs. The roles characters play in a group with a dragonmarked house patron often have more to do with their relationship to the house than with the specific roles in the party. Consider some or all of these roles for your characters:": "龙纹屋雇用适合他们需要的冒险者。角色在有龙纹屋守护者的团体中所扮演的角色往往与他们与龙纹屋的关系有关，而不是与派对中的具体角色有关。你可以考虑为你的角色设置一些或所有这些角色。",
	"{@b Adventurer}. Some characters are associated with your patron house because of their connection to its ruling family or its businesses. The Adventurer, though, is hired by the house for more traditional adventuring skills—usually capabilities that the house's other agents lack. The Adventurer might have a wide range of abilities, particular to whatever needs the House has at the time. Many with peculiar skills or highly specific fields of expertise find themselves in the employ of dragonmarked houses or house members with eccentric interests and deep pockets.": "{@b Adventurer}. 有些角色与你的守护家族有关，因为他们与该家族的统治者或其企业有联系。不过，冒险家受雇于该家族是为了获得更多传统的冒险技能--通常是该家族的其他代理人所缺乏的能力。冒险家可能拥有广泛的能力，特别是满足家族当时的任何需求。许多拥有奇特技能或高度具体的专业领域的人发现自己受雇于有龙纹的家族或拥有古怪兴趣和深厚财力的家族成员。",
	"{@b Guilder}. Every dragonmarked house is more than a single family. Each house encompasses at least one guild that operates just like a traditional craft or trade guild, and hundreds of people associate with these guilds while having no other relationship to the houses that oversee them. The Guilder is among these, perhaps being a skilled physician or cleric in House Jorasco's Healers Guild, for example, or an inquisitive associated with House Tharashk's Finders Guild. The Guilder might have the guild artisan background or some other set of skills suited to the specialties of your patron house's guilds.": "{@b Guilder}. 每个龙纹屋都不只是一个单一的家庭。每个家族至少有一个公会，其运作方式就像传统的手工业或贸易公会一样，有数百人与这些公会有联系，而与监督它们的家族没有其他关系。行会成员就是其中之一，比如说，他可能是乔拉斯科家族治疗师公会的一名熟练医生或牧师，或者是与塔拉什克家族的发现者公会有关的一名好奇者。行会成员可能有公会工匠的背景，或者其他一些适合你的守护家族的公会专长的技能。",
	"{@b Heir}. The Heir is a member of your dragonmarked house patron, related by blood and carrying the house name. This character most likely chooses the race that matches the bloodline of the house. The Heir can be dragonmarked (with the appropriate marked subrace or racial variant) or unmarked. The house agent background (described in this chapter) proves particularly appropriate for this character.": "{@b Heir}. 继承人是你的龙纹家族守护者的成员，有血缘关系，并带有家族的名字。这个角色很可能选择与家族血统相匹配的种族。继承人可以是龙纹（有适当的龙纹亚种或种族变体）或无龙纹。家族代理人的背景（在本章中描述）被证明特别适合这个角色。",
	"Your group and your DM should decide together which house employs you. The nature of the missions you undertake depends in part on the house or guild you work for, but there are general categories of work that every house needs agents to perform on its behalf. The House Missions table provides suggestions for which house might employ you along with multiple possibilities for adventures that overlap with their interests. For the more general kind of work you might carry out on behalf of any dragonmarked house, consult the General House Missions table.": "你的小组和你的DM应该一起决定哪个家族雇用你。你所承担的任务的性质部分取决于你为之工作的家族或公会，但每个家族都需要代理人代表它完成一些一般的工作。家族任务表提供了关于哪个家族可能雇用你的建议，以及与他们的兴趣相重合的多种冒险的可能性。关于你可能代表任何龙纹家族进行的更一般的工作，请参考一般家族任务表。",

	"Reports emerged this week of bitter disputes within the Twelve, the arcane institution that supposedly embodies the spirit of cooperation among the houses. According to a source that wished to remain anonymous, a special meeting of the Committee of Twelve was called last week to address accusations that researchers connected to House Kundarak had been diverting funds from the institute's budget to fund their own private projects, then concealing the results of those projects from their colleagues. Kundarak's representative, according to our source, denied the accusations, saying that the researchers are operating within their allotted budget and keeping their results secret only temporarily, as a matter of house security.": "本周出现了关于十二宫内部激烈争论的报告，十二宫是一个神秘的机构，据称体现了各宫之间的合作精神。据一位不愿透露姓名的消息人士称，上周十二院委员会召开了一次特别会议，以解决与昆达拉克家族有关的研究人员从研究所的预算中挪用资金来资助他们自己的私人项目，然后向他们的同事隐瞒这些项目的结果。据我们的消息来源称，昆达拉克的代表否认了这些指控，说研究人员是在其分配的预算范围内运作的，只是为了房子的安全而暂时对他们的结果保密。",
	"This matter is far from resolved, as the council meeting devolved into shouted arguments before disbanding. Representatives of House Medani and House Tharashk were particularly vocal in denouncing Kundarak, leaving this reporter to wonder whether a schism within the Council of Twelve might be imminent—and what that might mean for peaceful relations among the dragonmarked houses themselves.": "这件事远没有得到解决，因为理事会会议在解散前演变成了大喊大叫的争论。梅丹妮家族和塔拉什克家族的代表在谴责昆达拉克时特别大声，让本报记者怀疑十二人理事会内部的分裂是否迫在眉睫--这对有龙纹的家族之间的和平关系可能意味着什么。",
	"The Twelve facilitates communication and cooperation among the dragonmarked houses. As part of the agreements that ended the War of the Mark, the houses agreed to create an institute for the application of magic—a foundation that would study dragonmarks, along with more traditional forms of magic. Over the centuries, the Twelve has been responsible for many magical advances, including the airships operated by House Lyrandar and the message stations of House Sivis": "十二院促进了龙纹家族之间的交流与合作。作为结束龙纹战争的协议的一部分，各家族同意创建一个魔法应用研究所--一个研究龙纹和更多传统形式的魔法的基金会。几个世纪以来，十二院一直负责许多魔法方面的进步，包括利兰达家族运营的飞艇和西维斯家族的信息站。",
	"As an arm of the dragonmarked houses, the Twelve attempted to remain neutral during the Last War, but many of its wizards and artificers had national loyalties that were stronger than their ties to the institute. Now that the Twelve has resumed normal operations, it seeks to replace its lost members and make sure that each house is represented.": "作为龙纹家族的一个分支，十二星座试图在最后的战争中保持中立，但它的许多巫师和工匠的国家忠诚度比他们与学院的关系更强。现在，十二院已经恢复了正常的运作，它试图取代其失去的成员，并确保每个家族都有代表。",
	"While the Twelve provides a way for your group to work for multiple dragonmarked houses, its goals and benefits are similar to those of an individual house. Consider using the following details as a template if there's a particular dragonmarked house you wish to serve.": "虽然十二宫为你的团体提供了一种为多个龙纹屋工作的方式，但其目标和利益与单个龙纹屋相似。如果有一个特定的龙纹屋是你希望服务的，可以考虑使用下面的细节作为模板。",
	"As a patron, the Twelve is functionally similar to a dragonmarked house. Rather than advancing one house's interests, though, the Twelve seeks to advance magical developments that have practical value to society as well as potential for profit. All the houses contribute to the operating budget of the institute, and in theory they all benefit from the results of its research.": "作为一个赞助人，十二宫在功能上类似于一个有龙纹的家族。不过，十二宫并不是为了促进某个家族的利益，而是为了推动对社会有实际价值的魔法发展，以及潜在的利润。所有家族都为研究所的运营预算做出贡献，理论上他们都能从研究所的研究成果中获益。",
	"The Committee of Twelve oversees the institute. It currently has fifteen members, though its membership is a matter of significant disagreement within the council. There are of course only twelve dragonmarks, but the Mark of Shadow is represented by two different houses, and House Cannith is currently fragmented into three branches, each of which has claimed a seat on the council.": "十二人委员会负责监督该机构。它目前有15名成员，但其成员组成在理事会内部存在重大分歧。当然只有十二个龙印，但影子印记由两个不同的家族代表，坎尼斯家族目前被分割成三个分支，每个分支都在委员会中占有一个席位。",
	"The Twelve is headquartered in a many-spired keep that floats in the air above the city of Korth in Karrnath. Most researchers funded by the Twelve operate within this structure, but the institute occasionally pays grants to researchers whose promising work can't easily (or safely) be relocated inside the keep.": "十二院的总部设在卡尔纳特的科思市上空的一个有很多图案的堡垒里。大多数由十二星座资助的研究人员都在这个结构内工作，但研究所偶尔也会向那些有前途的工作不能轻易（或安全）地在堡垒内重新安置的研究人员支付补助金。",
	"With a long record of providing benefit to society at large, the Twelve is widely respected. Some of their closest allies include the following groups:": "由于长期以来为整个社会提供利益的记录，十二门徒会受到广泛尊重。他们的一些最亲密的盟友包括以下团体。",
	"{@b Dragonmarked Houses}. Above all, the Twelve has the almost universal support of the dragonmarked houses, which provide the funding to support its continued operation. One of the few things that all the houses agree on is that the Twelve should be allowed to do its work in peace. Agents of the Twelve can count on at least a minimal level of assistance from the houses in case of dire need.": "{@b Dragonmarked Houses}. 最重要的是，\"十二门徒会 \"几乎得到了有龙纹的家族的普遍支持，他们提供资金支持其继续运作。所有家族都同意的少数几件事之一是，应该允许十二宫和平地开展工作。十二宫的代理人在有迫切需要的情况下，至少可以指望得到各宫的最低程度的援助。",
	"{@b King Kaius}. Not every nation shares the same goodwill toward the Twelve, but the institutes's location above the city of Korth makes its relationship with Karrnath particularly important. The kings of Karrnath have regularly sought council from the Twelve, and Kaius has not abandoned this practice. Agents of Karrnath's government are inclined to trust agents of the Twelve and side with them in times of trouble.": "{@b King Kaius}. 并非每个国家都对十二门徒有同样的好感，但研究所位于科思城的上方，这使得它与卡尔纳特的关系特别重要。卡尔纳斯的国王经常向十二院寻求意见，凯厄斯也没有放弃这种做法。卡尔纳斯政府的代理人倾向于信任十二星座的代理人，并在遇到困难时与他们站在一起。",
	"{@b Manifest Institute}. In the city of Sharn, the Twelve sponsors the research of a number of scholars who make a study of the manifest zone that links the city to the plane of Syrania. Loosely organized as the Manifest Institute, these researchers include representatives from House Cannith, House Lyrandar, House Orien, and others, as well as those who work directly for the Twelve. The institute evaluates ways that the manifest zone might improve life in Sharn, seeks a deeper understanding of manifest zones in general, and plans contingencies in the event that the manifest zone ever evaporates.": "{@b Manifest Institute}. 在沙恩市，十二星座赞助了一些学者的研究，他们对连接该市和西拉尼亚平面的显形区进行研究。这些研究人员被松散地组织为 \"显灵研究所\"，其中包括来自坎尼斯家族、利兰达家族、奥瑞恩家族和其他家族的代表，以及直接为十二星座工作的人。研究所评估了显露区可以改善沙恩生活的方式，寻求对显露区的更深入了解，并计划在显露区消失的情况下的应急措施。",
	"Most enemies of the Twelve are individuals with grudges against the institute, which often stem from hurt feelings over being excluded from it. Those noted here number among the Twelve's fiercest foes:": "十二门徒会的大多数敌人都是对该机构心怀怨恨的人，这些怨恨往往来自于被排除在该机构之外的伤感。这里提到的人是十二门徒会最凶恶的敌人之一。",
	"{@b Arcane Congress}. Established by King Galifar I expressly to serve as a political answer to the Twelve, the Arcane Congress competes with the Twelve over resources and students. Some would argue that the ongoing rivalry encourages both institutions toward more and better arcane discoveries, but the animosity sometimes escalates to sabotage and researchers taking excessive risks.": "{@b Arcane Congress}. 由加里法尔一世国王建立的奥术大会在政治上是对十二宫的回应，它与十二宫在资源和学生方面存在竞争。有些人认为，这种持续的竞争鼓励两个机构朝着更多、更好的奥术发现前进，但这种敌意有时会升级为破坏行为和研究人员的过度冒险。",
	"{@b Mordain the Fleshweaver}. Not many personal grudges jeopardize the Twelve, but when a powerful wizard feels slighted, the impact can be significant. The elf wizard Mordain was banished from the Twelve more than two centuries ago because of his disturbing experiments related to the magic of the daelkyr. He dwells in Droaam now, focused on his research and plotting revenge. His reach isn't long, but agents of the Twelve avoid Droaam if at all possible.": "{@b Mordain the Fleshweaver}. 没有多少个人恩怨会危害到十二宫，但当一个强大的巫师感到被轻视时，其影响可能会很大。两个多世纪前，精灵巫师莫尔丹被放逐出十二宫，因为他做了与达尔凯尔魔法有关的令人不安的实验。他现在住在德罗阿姆，专注于他的研究并谋划着复仇。他的势力范围并不长，但十二神族的代理人尽可能地避开德罗阿姆。",
	"Secret agents, spies, undercover operatives—your group is part of an organization engaged in espionage. Most such agencies are attached to governments or dragonmarked houses, gathering information on the activities and plans of rival nations, houses, and businesses. Naturally, your affiliation with an espionage agency is a secret; you can't advertise that connection, and if you get in trouble with law enforcement forces (especially in foreign nations), your home nation will disavow you and deny any knowledge of your activities.": "秘密特工、间谍、卧底特工--你的团队是从事间谍活动的组织的一部分。大多数这样的机构都隶属于政府或有龙纹的家族，收集关于敌对国家、家族和企业的活动和计划的信息。自然，你与间谍机构的关系是一个秘密；你不能宣传这种关系，如果你遇到执法部队的麻烦（尤其是在外国），你的祖国会否认你，并否认知道你的活动。",

The Dark Lanterns also have an unwritten license to eliminate any creature that threatens their nation, its sovereign, or its citizens.": "国王的黑灯笼是国王城堡的情报部门，该组织发誓要从敌人手中保卫布雷兰，并以博拉内尔国王的名义执行正义。作为王室的秘密仆人，该组织的成员被授权在外国领土上开展情报行动，在全球范围内执行秘密任务，并防止国家机密落入敌对情报机构的手中。黑暗灯笼也有一个不成文的许可，可以消灭任何威胁到他们国家、其主权或其公民的生物。",
	"The King's Citadel is based in Breland's capital city of Wroat, under the command of the king's brother, Lord Kor ir'Wynarn. A changeling named Captain Vron serves as the leader of the Dark Lanterns, with four subordinate knights marshal leading branch offices across Breland, in Sharn, Starilaskur, and Xandrar. A much smaller branch office keeps an eye on Brelish interests in the city of Stormreach, in Xen'drik. Small, temporary field offices are sometimes established to coordinate missions outside Breland; these offices double as safe houses for agents in trouble, and they are designed to be wiped clean at a moment's notice if discovered by local authorities.": "国王的城堡位于布雷兰的首都沃鲁特，由国王的弟弟科尔-伊尔'维纳恩勋爵指挥。一位名叫弗隆（Vron）上尉的变种人担任黑暗之灯的首领，四位下属骑士负责领导布雷兰在沙恩、斯塔拉斯库尔和桑德拉的分支办事处。在Xen'drik的Stormreach市，有一个小得多的分支办公室，负责监视布瑞利什的利益。有时也会设立一些小型的、临时的外地办事处，以协调布瑞尔大陆以外的任务；这些办事处同时也是陷入困境的特工的安全屋，如果被当地政府发现，它们可以在第一时间被清除掉。",
	"The Sharn office of the King's Citadel is in Andith Tower in the Ambassador Towers district. Though a knight marshal commands the office, most of the King's Citadel members in Sharn are Dark Lanterns, and thus under the authority of a scheming and ruthless gnome named Talleon Haliar Tonan.": "国王城堡的沙恩办公室位于大使塔区的安迪斯塔内。虽然有一位骑士元帅指挥该办公室，但沙恩的大部分国王城堡成员都是黑暗灯笼，因此受一个名叫塔利昂-哈利亚尔-托南的阴谋家的管辖。",
	"The King's Dark Lanterns includes more than 500 agents operating within Breland's borders and roughly one-fifth that number stationed abroad. They often work in teams, and also work closely with the other divisions of the Citadel. Sometimes they recruit local talent, often under false pretenses, to help them accomplish their missions in foreign lands.": "国王的黑暗灯笼包括500多名在布雷兰境内活动的特工，大约有五分之一的特工驻扎在国外。他们经常以团队形式工作，也与城堡的其他部门紧密合作。有时他们会招募当地的人才，通常是以虚假的借口，帮助他们完成在外国的任务。",
	"By their nature, espionage agencies must be cautious in choosing their allies, and the King's Dark Lanterns is no exception. Its most trustworthy allies include the following facets of the Brelish government:": "就其性质而言，间谍机构在选择其盟友时必须谨慎，国王的黑暗灯笼也不例外。它最值得信赖的盟友包括布雷利什政府的以下方面。",
	"{@b King Boranel}. The King's Dark Lanterns, as one would expect, serve the king of Breland, and he is their greatest advocate and ally. The king views loyalty as mutual: as long as an agent's loyalty is irreproachable, Boranel is willing to exercise his considerable power on that agent's behalf.": "{@b King Boranel}. 国王的黑暗灯笼，正如人们所期望的那样，为布雷兰德的国王服务，他是他们最大的支持者和盟友。国王认为忠诚是相互的：只要特工的忠诚是无可指责的，博拉内尔就愿意为该特工行使他的巨大权力。",
	"{@b The King's Citadel}. The Citadel has three branches besides the Dark Lanterns. The King's Swords are elite special combat forces. The King's Shields protect the king and his closest family members and associates. The King's Wands provide magical support to the other branches of the Citadel as well as other Brelish forces. Some Dark Lanterns might think themselves superior to members of the other branches, but even so they recognize other Citadel agents as players on the same team. When your group needs a little extra help, the other branches of the Citadel are there for you.": "{@b The King's Citadel}. 除了黑暗灯笼，城堡还有三个分支。国王之剑是精锐的特种作战部队。国王之盾保护国王和他最亲密的家人和伙伴。国王的魔杖为城堡的其他分支以及其他布雷利什部队提供魔法支持。一些黑灯侠可能会认为自己比其他分支的成员高明，但即便如此，他们也会承认其他城主府特工是同一团队的成员。当你的团队需要一点额外的帮助时，城堡的其他分支就在你身边。",
	"Rare is the espionage agency that is loved. Even within Breland, the populace views the Dark Lanterns with suspicion, and powerful people outside the royal family harbor resentment at the influence of the Citadel. Many people and institutions outside Breland view the Dark Lanterns as a hostile force. As a result, the following groups account for just a few enemies of the Dark Lanterns:": "罕见的是，间谍机构受到了喜爱。即使在布雷兰内部，民众也以怀疑的眼光看待黑暗之灯，而皇室以外的有权势的人则对城堡的影响力怀有怨恨。布雷兰德之外的许多人和机构将黑暗之灯视为一种敌对势力。因此，以下团体只占黑暗之灯的少数敌人。",
	"{@b Brelish Populists}. As much as King Boranel is loved in his country, many Brelish voices argue that the era of monarchy is at an end, and the throne of Breland should be replaced by a government democratically elected by the citizenry. When these forces grow restless enough to plot and riot, the Citadel—and often the Dark Lanterns—work to bring them to heel. As a result, those who question the authority of the king are the most likely Brelish citizens to mistrust the Dark Lanterns or view them with open hostility. According to rumor some of those people even hold high positions in the Brelish government.": "{@b Brelish Populists}. 尽管博拉内尔国王在他的国家里备受爱戴，但许多布雷利什人认为君主制的时代已经结束，布雷兰的王位应该由公民民主选举的政府所取代。当这些势力不安分地策划和骚乱时，城堡--通常是黑暗灯笼--就会努力将他们置于死地。因此，那些质疑国王权威的人是最有可能不信任黑暗灯笼的布雷利什公民，或者对他们抱有公开敌意。据传言，其中一些人甚至在布雷利什政府中担任高级职务。",
	"{@b Foreign Nations}. Every nation knows the King's Dark Lanterns serves as an espionage force and do their best to track the movements of Dark Lantern agents within their borders. Foreign governments treat Dark Lantern agents with care to avoid sparking an international incident, but they are quick to arrest Dark Lantern agents suspected of wrongdoing.": "{@b Foreign Nations}. 每个国家都知道国王的黑暗灯笼作为一支间谍部队，并尽力追踪黑暗灯笼特工在其境内的行动。外国政府谨慎对待黑暗灯笼特工，以避免引发国际事件，但他们会迅速逮捕涉嫌犯错的黑暗灯笼特工。",
	"{@b New Cyre}. One of the world's largest concentrations of Cyran refugees settled in eastern Breland under the leadership of Oargev ir'Wynarn, the last prince of Cyre. Many voices among the Cyrans, possibly including Oargev himself, call for the establishment of an independent nation in what is now Brelish territory, but Boranel is determined to hold on to every acre of his land. The Dark Lanterns actively infiltrate the Cyran refugee community, rooting out those who would act against the king.": "{@b New Cyre}. 世界上最大的赛伦难民集中地之一，在赛尔的最后一位王子Oargev ir'Wynarn的领导下，定居在布瑞尔东部。在赛尔人中有许多声音，可能包括奥格夫本人，呼吁在现在的布雷利什领土上建立一个独立的国家，但博拉内尔决心守住他的每一亩土地。黑暗灯笼积极渗透到锡兰难民社区，将那些反对国王的人连根拔起。",
	"You gain the following benefits when your group's patron is an espionage agency:": "当你的团体的赞助人是一个间谍机构时，你获得以下好处。",
	"{@b Assignments}. Your agency might assign you specific tasks at any time, at the DM's discretion. You have wide latitude regarding how you carry out a task, and your assignments can sometimes be very broad and require considerable time to complete.": "{@b Assignments}. 你的机构可能在任何时候给你分配具体的任务，由管理部决定。你在如何执行任务方面有很大的自由度，你的任务有时可能非常广泛，需要相当长的时间来完成。",
	"{@b Expense Account}. You have access to an account maintained at the banks of House Kundarak. You can use this account to pay your daily living expenses, as well as for purchasing anything you need for completing your missions—equipment, transportation, bribes, and so on. Your normal spending limit is 100 gp per month for each member of your group. If you exceed that, your agency asks you to account for the month's expenses, and they might require you to pay back the excess if you can't justify it (at the DM's discretion). You can't carry over an unused amount from one month to the next, and your access to this account can be cut off at any time if you abuse it or fall out of the agency's good graces. The agency is aware of every time you access the account and where you are when you do so.": "{@b Expense Account}. 你可以使用昆达拉克家族银行的一个账户。你可以用这个账户来支付你的日常生活费用，以及购买你完成任务所需的任何东西--设备、交通、贿赂等等。你的正常消费限额是你的小组每个成员每月100戈比。如果你超过了这个限额，你的机构就会要求你说明这个月的开支，如果你不能说明理由，他们可能会要求你偿还超出的部分（由管理员决定）。你不能将未使用的金额从一个月结转到下一个月，而且如果你滥用这个账户或失去了机构的好感，你对这个账户的使用权随时可能被切断。该机构知道你每次进入该账户的情况，以及你这样做时的位置。",
	"{@b Identification}. Your agency provides you with identification papers establishing your true identity, and you also have ready access to false papers and matching travel documents showing different identities, when you need them for a mission. (Any time you enter a foreign nation, it is a good idea for you to do so under a false identity.)": "{@b Identification}. 你的机构为你提供确定你真实身份的身份证件，当你执行任务需要时，你也可以随时获得显示不同身份的假证件和匹配的旅行文件。(任何时候你进入一个外国，用一个假的身份是一个好主意）。",
	"{@b Powerful Friends}. An espionage agency, by nature, has a long reach and a lot of power to make things happen behind the scenes. You can call in a favor for a wide range of benefits: A legal case against you might be suddenly dropped. A rival might disappear. A much-needed magic item might be delivered to you. These favors can provide significant short-term benefit, but they can also come with equally significant long-term repercussions—which might lead to entirely new missions.": "{@b Powerful Friends}. 一个间谍机构，就其性质而言，具有很强的影响力和很大的权力，可以在幕后使事情发生。你可以叫人帮忙，获得广泛的利益。一个针对你的法律案件可能突然被撤销。一个对手可能会消失。一个急需的魔法物品可能会被送到你手中。这些人情可以提供重要的短期利益，但它们也可以带来同样重要的长期影响--这可能会导致全新的任务。",
	"Espionage agents are typically both highly trained and tightly specialized. The type of missions you undertake can shape your group's composition; you might be a team of hunters or investigators, focused on tracking people down or gathering information. More likely, you're a diverse team with a range of skills that allow you undertake a variety of different missions on your patron's behalf. Consider some or all of these roles for the characters in your party:": "间谍人员通常都是训练有素的，而且专业性很强。你所承担的任务类型可以塑造你的团队的组成；你可能是一个猎人或调查员的团队，专注于追踪人或收集信息。更有可能的是，你们是一个多样化的团队，拥有一系列的技能，可以代表你的赞助人承担各种不同的任务。考虑为你的队伍中的角色设置一些或所有这些角色。",
	"{@b Chameleon}. A master of disguise, sleight of hand, and deception, the Chameleon can perform the work of the Investigator or a Confiscator right under a target's nose—or provide cover to agents with different specialties as they do their jobs. A high Charisma, proficiency with the disguise kit (or access to spells that cloak or disguise one's appearance), and proficiency with skills such as {@skill Deception}, {@skill Performance}, and {@skill Sleight of Hand} all greatly benefit the Chameleon. Bards and rogues, as well as characters with the charlatan, entertainer, or urchin background, often excel in this role.": "{@b Chameleon}. 变色龙是伪装、诡计和欺骗的大师，他可以在目标的眼皮底下完成调查员或没收者的工作--或者为不同专业的特工在工作中提供掩护。高的魅力、对伪装工具的熟练掌握（或使用能掩盖或伪装自己外表的法术），以及对{@skill Deception}、{@skill Performance}和{@skill Sleight of Hand}等技能的熟练掌握，都对变色龙大有好处。吟游诗人和无赖，以及具有江湖郎中、艺人或顽童背景的人物，往往擅长这个角色。",

	"{@b Operator}. An Operator leads or organizes a team of agents in the field. Like a military officer, the Operator issues orders and bears responsibility for the agents on the team. High Charisma and Intelligence scores help make the Operator a strong leader, especially in conjunction with skill proficiencies such as {@skill Persuasion} and {@skill Investigation}. The wide array of skills used by other agents are also valuable to the Operator, who might end up stepping into a different role when the need arises. The Operator is often a bard and might come from a soldier or noble background (being accustomed to leadership in one form or another).": "{@b Operator}. 接线员领导或组织一个外勤特工小组。像一个军官一样，接线员发布命令并对团队中的特工负责。高的魅力和智力分数有助于使接线员成为一个强有力的领导者，特别是与技能熟练度相结合，如{@skill Persuasion}和{@skill Investigation}。其他特工使用的各种技能对接线员也很有价值，当需要时，他可能最终会进入一个不同的角色。操作员通常是一个吟游诗人，可能来自士兵或贵族背景（习惯于以某种形式进行领导）。",
	"Espionage activities can be classified in three broad categories: counterintelligence, covert action, and intelligence gathering.

Oargev has not forgotten that kindness, and he would prefer not to jeopardize his friendship with Boranel by seizing land from Breland. However, rumors persist that Oargev plans to secede, and the King's Dark Lanterns frequently send agents into New Cyre to keep an eye on anti-Brelish sentiment. Oargev wisely views Boranel as an ally, but knows Breland could be a threat.": "{@b King Boranel}. 布雷兰德的统治者对赛尔人民做了一件大好事，建立了难民营，现在已经发展成为新赛尔。Oargev并没有忘记这份恩情，他不希望因为从布雷兰夺取土地而损害他与Boranel的友谊。然而，关于奥格夫计划分离的传言一直存在，国王的黑暗灯笼经常派遣特工进入新赛尔，以监视反布瑞尔的情绪。奥格夫明智地将博拉内尔视为盟友，但也知道布雷兰德可能是一个威胁。",
	"{@b Q'barra}. Aside from New Cyre, the largest population of Cyran refugees resides in Q'barra. Oargev has invited these displaced Cyrans to join him in New Cyre, but most of them have started putting down new roots in the jungle land.

Many of them bitterly bear the scars of the war, their resentments reinforced by the deeds of violent Cyran extremists. Even the Brelish, for all their practiced indifference, become guarded when confronted by Cyrans, who represent a burden foisted upon them by their leaders. They tend to treat Cyran refugees as second-class citizens and vagabonds. Among non-Cyran communities, agents of Prince Oargev can't rely on aid from any of Cyre's former enemies.": "{@b The Five Nations}. 昂代尔人、卡伦人和瑟兰人一般都不同情流离失所的赛兰人的困境。他们中的许多人痛苦地承受着战争的伤痛，他们的怨恨被暴力的赛伦极端分子的行为所强化。即使是布雷利什人，尽管他们一直表现得很冷漠，但在面对赛伦人时也变得小心翼翼，因为赛伦人是他们的领导人强加给他们的负担。他们倾向于将居里安人难民视为二等公民和流浪者。在非居里安社区中，欧格夫王子的代理人不能依靠任何居里安的前敌人的援助。",
	"{@b The Lord of Blades.} In the depths of the Mournland, the closest thing to a sovereign is {@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}—a heavily enhanced warforged who seeks vengeance against those who created his people to serve as weapons. He is hostile to adventurers who enter the Mournland on missions of plunder, and the idea of Prince Oargev reclaiming the Mournland fills him with fury. He shows Oargev's agents no mercy.": "{@b The Lord of Blades.}在哀伤之地的深处，最接近君主的东西是{@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}--一个重度强化的战争锻造者，他要向那些创造他的人民作为武器的人复仇。他对进入哀牢地执行掠夺任务的冒险者充满敌意，而奥格夫王子夺回哀牢地的想法让他充满愤怒。他对Oargev的代理人毫不留情。",
	"With a head of state as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "如果有国家元首作为你的团体的赞助人，你会获得以下好处。",
	"Prince Oargev, the exiled Cyran royal who governs the town of New Cyre by the sufferance of King Boranel, is planning a brazen act of secession, hoping to transform all of eastern Breland into a new Cyran realm, sources say. According to a group of adventurers recently employed by Oargev, the prince sent them into the Mournland to recover weapons of war so they could be wielded against the Brelish military during the secession. How will King Boranel respond to this treachery? Will the nations come to the defense of the displaced prince? Will Oargev's scheming result in all of eastern Breland being swathed in the same gray mist that consumed Cyre?": "Oargev王子，被流放的Cyran王族，在Boranel国王的容忍下管理着New Cyre镇，正在计划一个厚颜无耻的分离行为，希望把整个东部Breland变成一个新的Cyran王国，消息来源说。根据奥格夫最近雇佣的一群冒险家的说法，王子派他们进入哀伤之地找回战争武器，以便在分离期间可以用来对付布雷利什的军队。博拉内尔国王将如何应对这种背叛行为？各国会不会来保卫这个流离失所的王子？奥格夫的阴谋是否会导致整个布瑞尔东部被笼罩在吞噬赛尔的灰雾中？",
	"{@b Assignments}. Your work is performed at the direction of your patron. That means you are usually under assignment and not entirely free to choose your own course. Depending on the ruler and the task, these assignments can be directive or more hands-off, as you pursue long-term goals.": "{@b Assignments}. 你的工作是在你的赞助人的指导下进行的。这意味着你通常要接受任务，不能完全自由地选择自己的路线。根据统治者和任务的不同，这些任务可以是指令性的，也可以是更多的放手，因为你要追求长期的目标。",
	"{@b Expenses}. In addition to your salary, your patron reimburses you for extraordinary expenses incurred as part of your work. You are required to account for your expenses and might be called on to explain any extraordinary expenditures, but routine travel, ordinary equipment, and most services don't draw a second glance.": "{@b Expenses}. 除了你的工资，你的赞助人还报销你在工作中发生的特殊费用。你被要求说明你的开支，并可能被要求解释任何特殊开支，但日常旅行、普通设备和大多数服务不会引起人们的注意。",
	"{@b Immunity}. As long as you remain in the head of state's good graces, you are nearly immune to prosecution under the laws of your home country. Committing serious crimes—especially if they are unrelated or unnecessary for the work you've been assigned—is a good way to fall out of your patron's good graces, however. When you are carrying out your orders within your nation's borders, though, you have a great deal of leeway in how you choose to do that, and the law isn't an obstacle. (However, note that agents of Prince Oargev can't necessarily expect the same clemency in Breland outside of New Cyre.)": "{@b Immunity}. 只要你保持在国家元首的好感中，你就几乎不会受到本国法律的起诉。然而，犯下严重的罪行--特别是如果这些罪行与你被指派的工作无关或没有必要--是失去你的赞助人的好感的一个好办法。不过，当你在你的国家边界内执行你的命令时，你有很大的余地来选择如何做，而法律并不是一个障碍。(然而，请注意，在新赛尔之外的布雷兰，奥格夫王子的代理人不一定能指望得到同样的宽恕）。",
	"{@b Salary}. Your employment for a head of state brings you an income of 1 gp per day, or enough to maintain a modest lifestyle.

The Heads of State table at the end of the section offers additional options for leaders who might make appealing patrons.": "有时，国家元首指派的任务与间谍机构或军事力量的任务之间存在着细微的差别，但你的团队的核心重点是政治。作为一个团队，请参考锡兰事务表，并与你的DM合作，决定你代表奥格夫王子进行什么样的冒险。本节末尾的国家元首表为那些可能成为吸引人的赞助人的领导人提供了额外的选择。",

	"{@b Double}. Your allegiance lies with an official or government other than the one you overtly serve. You may receive support from the head of state you openly answer follow, as well as the official you secretly report to, but must remain on constant guard against having your true loyalties revealed.": "{@b Double}. 你的效忠对象是你公开服务的官员或政府以外的人。你可能会得到你公开效忠的国家元首的支持，以及你秘密报告的官员的支持，但你必须时刻保持警惕，防止你的真实忠诚度被暴露。",
	"Often, your connection to your patron is quite direct—the head of state summons you, grants you an audience, and gives you an assignment or hears your report. Heads of state are busy people, though, and if your business isn't pressing, you might be handled by a functionary of the court. The State Contacts table provides several options for what functionaries your group might work with when the head of state is indisposed.": "通常情况下，你与你的赞助人的联系是非常直接的--国家元首召唤你，准许你觐见，给你一个任务或听取你的报告。不过，国家元首都是大忙人，如果你的事情不急，你可能会被法院的一个官员处理。国家联系表提供了几个选项，当国家元首不在时，你的团体可以与哪些职能部门合作。",

	"A mysterious figure who appears in lofty myths and children's fables, Sora Kell extends her reach across the world and through the myriad planes, claiming mystical knowledge by force and cunning. A mighty wizard with magic worthy of epic tales, she is a monster whose adamantine claws can flense whole armies before any soldier can land a blow on her plated hide. Tales of Sora Kell claim she is the first night hag, born from Khyber in the first age of the world alongside the ancient rakshasas. Some even claim that her daughters—the hags who rule Droaam—are either direct agents of her will or have trapped her and pursue their own goals.": "作为一个出现在崇高的神话和儿童寓言中的神秘人物，索拉-凯尔将她的触角伸向了整个世界和无数个星球，通过武力和狡猾来索取神秘的知识。她是一个强大的巫师，拥有堪比史诗故事的魔法，她是一个怪物，其金刚般的爪子可以在任何士兵对她的镀金皮进行打击之前就把整支军队打散。关于索拉-凯尔的故事声称她是第一个夜行者，在世界的第一个时代从开伯尔出生，与古老的罗刹人一起。有些人甚至声称她的女儿们--统治Droaam的女巫--要么是她意志的直接代理人，要么是困住了她并追求自己的目标。",
	"One fact is indisputable: Sora Kell is an immortal being who employs mortals to do her bidding. In exchange, she trades lore from her boundless stores of magic items, racks of scrolls, libraries of ancient spells, maps of forgotten ruins, and tomes unveiling the mysteries of the multiverse, which she has secreted away in caches across the planes.": "有一个事实是毋庸置疑的。索拉-凯尔是一个雇佣凡人为她服务的不朽生命。作为交换，她从她无边无际的魔法物品仓库、卷轴架、古代法术图书馆、被遗忘的废墟地图以及揭开多元宇宙之谜的书籍中交换传说，她把这些东西藏在各个星球的仓库里。",
	"Unlike some other immortal patrons, Sora Kell's physical form has not been seen on Eberron for over a century. Perhaps she has set a task before her daughters and watches events unfold. Maybe she is trapped upon another plane of existence or is devising magic that could shake the foundations of existence. In any case, she appears in the dreams of her agents, or occasionally uses magical means to communicate, sometimes directly, other times through sinister omens.": "与其他一些不朽的守护者不同，索拉-凯尔的身体形态已经有一个多世纪没有在Eberron出现了。也许她在她的女儿们面前布置了一个任务，并看着事件的发展。也许她被困在另一个存在平面上，或者正在设计可以动摇存在根基的魔法。在任何情况下，她都会出现在她的代理人的梦中，或者偶尔使用魔法手段进行交流，有时是直接交流，有时是通过险恶的预兆。",
	"As a creature of legend, Sora Kell can hardly be said to have allies, except for a handful of other legends like the following groups:": "作为传说中的生物，索拉-凯尔很难说有盟友，除了少数其他传说中的人，如以下团体。",
	"{@b Daughters of Sora Kell.} Sora Kell's three daughters—the gifted oracle Sora Teraza, the cunning trickster Sora Katra, and the vicious monster Sora Maenya—rule the nation of Droaam, either to facilitate their own scheming or at their mother's command. Adventurers who enjoy the patronage of Sora Kell can impose on her daughters for aid if they should ever find themselves in or near Droaam. They can also count on the aid of Daask, a criminal gang in Sharn, which is controlled by Sora Katra.": "{@b Daughters of Sora Kell.}索拉-凯尔的三个女儿--有天赋的神谕者索拉-泰拉扎、狡猾的诡计家索拉-卡特拉和邪恶的怪物索拉-梅尼亚--统治着德罗阿姆国家，或是为了方便她们自己的阴谋，或是听从她们母亲的命令。享有索拉-凯尔赞助的冒险家们如果发现自己在德罗阿姆或附近，可以向她的女儿们寻求援助。他们也可以指望达斯克的援助，达斯克是沙恩的一个犯罪团伙，由索拉-卡特拉控制。",
	"{@b Lords of Dust}. Ancient fiends number among Sora Kell's allies—not the least of which are her daughters' three long-forgotten fathers. It isn't for Sora Kell's pawns to know which of the powerful villains are friendly to Sora Kell, but she occasionally sends adventurers to lend aid to rakshasas—often lesser fiends working to free the ancient overlords. Wise adventurers carefully weigh the rewards of working with such fiends against the costs—to themselves and the world.": "{@b Lords of Dust}. 在索拉-凯尔的盟友中，古老的恶魔很多--其中最重要的是她女儿的三个早已被遗忘的父亲。索拉-凯尔的卒子不知道哪些强大的恶棍对索拉-凯尔是友好的，但她偶尔会派冒险者向拉卡萨斯提供援助--通常是那些致力于解放古代霸主的较小的恶魔。明智的冒险者会仔细权衡与这些恶魔合作的回报与他们自己和世界的代价。",
	"Like most immortal beings, Sora Kell has many enemies, though the mortal ones barely merit her attention. For the most part, only beings like those that follow dare oppose Sora Kell:": "像大多数不朽的生命一样，索拉-凯尔有许多敌人，尽管凡人几乎不值得她注意。在大多数情况下，只有像后面那些人一样的生命才敢反对索拉-凯尔。",
	"{@b The Dreaming Dark}. In Sora Kell's estimation, the greatest threat to her are the quori of Dal Quor, and their minions, the Dreaming Dark. Fortunately for the adventurers that serve Sora Kell, few mortals register as worthy foes in the alien minds of the quori.": "{@b The Dreaming Dark}. 在索拉-凯尔的估计中，对她最大的威胁是达尔-库尔的科里，以及他们的爪牙--梦中的黑暗。对于为索拉-凯尔服务的冒险者来说，幸运的是，在奎里人的外星思维中，很少有凡人能成为值得尊敬的敌人。",
	"{@b Lords of Dust}. Sora Kell has allies among the Lords of Dust, but she also has bitter rivals. Like the quori, these fiends rarely pay much attention to Sora Kell's mortal minions, but they aren't above harming mortal adventurers just to spite her.": "{@b Lords of Dust}. 索拉-凯尔在尘土领主中拥有盟友，但她也有激烈的对手。像科里一样，这些恶魔很少关注索拉-凯尔的凡人爪牙，但他们也不排除为了报复她而伤害凡人冒险者。",
	"The patronage of an immortal being is a relationship built on favors, not on employment or service. Your group does favors for your patron, and you can ask favors in return. These favors are the benefits you gain for having an immortal being as your group's patron, and they might include any of the following boons:": "不朽者的赞助是一种建立在恩惠上的关系，而不是雇佣或服务。你的团体为你的赞助人提供帮助，而你可以要求对方提供帮助作为回报。这些恩惠是你获得的好处，因为有一个不朽的生命作为你的团体的赞助人，它们可能包括以下任何一种好处。",
	"{@b Contacts}. Your group is almost certainly not the only one sponsored by your patron. Plans that span the world and the course of millennia require many agents to complete. If necessary, your patron can put you in contact with their other agents, who might be in a position to help you through status, influence, or magic.": "{@b Contacts}. 你的团体几乎肯定不是你的赞助人所赞助的唯一团体。跨越世界和千年的计划需要许多代理人来完成。如果有必要，你的赞助人可以让你与他们的其他代理人取得联系，他们可能会通过地位、影响或魔法来帮助你。",
	"{@b Information}. The most precious reward most immortals can give is a tidbit of their ages-spanning knowledge. Immortal beings often know secrets hidden from most mortals—including glimpses of possible futures. They don't usually share secrets freely, but they might reward your group for the completion of a mission with a hint, a puzzle, or a morsel of information that sets you off in pursuit of more.": "{@b Information}. 大多数不朽者能给予的最珍贵的奖赏是他们跨越时代的知识的一个小插曲。不朽的生命往往知道大多数凡人所不知道的秘密--包括对可能的未来的一瞥。他们通常不会随意分享秘密，但他们可能会在你的团队完成任务后给你一个提示，一个谜题，或者一个信息，让你去追求更多的东西。",
	"{@b Magic}. Immortal beings often have access to vast stores of magic, including their own spells and secret caches of magic items. They are mindful of the value of this magic, and grant spells and items as rewards appropriate to the favor and the power of the adventurers.": "{@b Magic}. 不朽的生命通常可以获得大量的魔法储存，包括他们自己的法术和秘密藏匿的魔法物品。他们注意到这些魔法的价值，并给予法术和物品作为与冒险者的恩惠和力量相适应的奖励。",
	"Though it is not a sentient force that can control or reward your party, the Draconic Prophecy can be similar to an Immortal Being patron. The Prophecy can act as a guide for adventurers who seek to fulfill it—or to steer its fulfillment in a particular direction. You stand among the heroes of the present age; surely you have a role to play in the unfolding prophecy.": "虽然它不是一种可以控制或奖励你的队伍的有生命的力量，但德拉贡的预言可以类似于不朽的存在的守护者。预言可以作为寻求实现它的冒险者的向导--或者将它的实现引向一个特定的方向。你站在当今时代的英雄之中；你肯定能在正在展开的预言中扮演一个角色。",
	"In order for the Draconic Prophecy to work as a patron, one or more of the characters needs to have access to words from the Prophecy. Your group might adventure to seek out places where the Prophecy is written: mountainsides and cavern walls, ancient text and crumbling ruins, or the patterns of moons, stars, and the Ring of Siberys (best interpreted at an observatory). A dragonmarked character might gain insight into the Prophecy from the marks on their skin. Alternatively, a character might hear words from the Prophecy in dreams or visions, or surfacing from some deeply buried memory of a traumatic event.": "为了让《德拉贡预言》作为守护者发挥作用，一个或多个角色需要接触到预言中的文字。你的团队可以冒险去寻找写有预言的地方：山坡和洞壁、古老的文字和摇摇欲坠的废墟，或者月亮、星星和西伯利亚之环的图案（最好在天文台解释）。一个有龙纹的角色可能从他们皮肤上的印记中获得对预言的洞察力。另外，一个角色可能会在梦境或幻觉中听到预言的话语，或者从某个深埋的创伤性事件的记忆中浮现出来。",
	"Given access to the words of the Prophecy, it's up to the characters to decide what they mean. The Prophecy is notoriously difficult to interpret, and a given passage might be fulfilled in different ways (or, possibly, in multiple ways over the course of centuries). For example, take a prophetic snippet like the one mentioned in the book's introduction: \"If the Bear King is slain by a sorrowful assassin in the Shadow of the Mourning, the Crown will fall from his nation.\" This might mean that if King Boranel of Breland is killed in the Mournland, the kingdom of Breland will be dissolved, and if dissolving the monarchy is the characters' goal, they can try to bring about those circumstances. On the other hand, it could mean that if an awakened bear in the Eldeen Reaches declares himself king of the forest, and if the bear is killed on the anniversary of the Mourning, the tallest tree in the domain he claimed (the Crown of his nation) will fall. If that is the characters' goal, for whatever reason, they might try to bring those circumstances about.": "在获得了预言的话语后，就由人物来决定它们的含义。预言是出了名的难以解释，某段话可能会以不同的方式实现（或者，可能是在几个世纪的时间里以多种方式实现）。例如，就拿该书导言中提到的一个预言片段来说吧。\"如果熊王在哀伤的阴影中被一个悲伤的刺客杀死，王冠将从他的国家中掉落。\" 这可能意味着，如果布雷兰国王博拉内尔在哀伤之影中被杀，布雷兰王国将被解散，如果解散君主制是人物的目标，他们可以尝试促成这些情况的发生。另一方面，这可能意味着，如果一只在Eldeen Reaches觉醒的熊宣布自己是森林之王，如果这只熊在哀伤纪念日被杀，他所宣称的领域中最高的树（他的国家的王冠）将会倒下。如果这是人物的目标，无论出于什么原因，他们可能会试图使这些情况发生。",
	"The currency of favors that defines most patronage relationships is tricky when your group's patron is a series of vague oracular verses rather than a person. However, bringing about the fulfillment of the Prophecy in a certain way often has immediate or long-term benefits that are equivalent to the favors another patron might grant your group. Toppling the Crown in the Bear King's domain might give you access to a spell inscribed in the ancient tree's rings, for example.": "当你的团体的赞助人是一系列模糊的神谕诗句而不是一个人时，定义大多数赞助关系的恩惠货币就很棘手。然而，以某种方式实现预言往往会带来直接或长期的好处，这些好处相当于另一个赞助人可能给予你的团体的恩惠。例如，推翻熊王领域的王冠可能会让你获得刻在古树年轮上的咒语。",
	"No common thread unites adventurers with an immortal patron, except perhaps uncommon openness to the mysterious and unknown. You haven't been chosen because of your capabilities; they might have been chosen to fulfill the words of a prophecy, because they were born at auspicious times and places, or because they happened to be in a particular place at a certain time. Individual characters in your group might have different relationships with your patron, though; consider some or all of these roles for your characters:": "没有任何共同的线索将冒险者与不朽的守护者联系在一起，也许只有对神秘和未知的不寻常的开放。你被选中并不是因为你的能力；他们被选中可能是为了实现一个预言，因为他们出生在吉祥的时间和地点，或者因为他们碰巧在某个时间出现在某个特定的地方。不过，你的小组中的个别角色可能与你的赞助人有不同的关系；为你的角色考虑一些或所有这些角色。",
	"{@b Innocent}. Some characters have no intention of becoming adventurers and desire no connection to the machinations of the immortals, but they get caught up in schemes and prophecies anyway. The Innocent might have been identified as a key part of a prophecy, or made what seemed like an innocent bargain with a harmless old hermit, or found an artifact with mysterious powers. The folk hero background is ideal for the Innocent, combining humble origins with a sense of destiny. Any class or proficiencies are suited for this role.": "{@b Innocent}. 有些角色无意成为冒险家，也不希望与不朽者的阴谋有任何联系，但他们还是被卷入了阴谋和预言中。无辜者可能已经被确定为预言的关键部分，或者与一个无害的老隐士做了一个看似无辜的交易，或者发现了一个具有神秘力量的文物。民间英雄的背景是无罪者的理想选择，将卑微的出身与命运感结合起来。任何等级或能力都适合这个角色。",
	"The tasks you perform for your immortal patron can be mysterious, even trivial seeming, but they always have implications within the immortal's larger plans. Often it's hard to tell what those implications might be—and stumbling upon hints of an immortal's broader agenda might prove frightening. Your tasks could involve fulfilling prophecies in deliberate ways, preventing prophesied events from coming to pass, or even engaging in seemingly random actions that further designs invisible to mortal eyes. Immortal beings might send you on all manner of adventures, such as those shown on the Immortal Missions table.": "你为你的不朽守护者执行的任务可能是神秘的，甚至是看起来微不足道的，但它们总是在不朽者的更大计划中产生影响。通常很难说这些影响是什么--偶然发现不朽者更广泛的议程的暗示可能会被证明是可怕的。你的任务可能涉及以故意的方式实现预言，阻止预言事件的发生，或者甚至参与看似随机的行动，以推进凡人眼中看不见的设计。不朽的生命可能会派你进行各种形式的冒险，比如不朽的任务表上显示的那些。",

	"{@b Flamewind}. A gynosphinx with oracular powers came back to Morgrave University with a Xen'drik expedition two years ago, and took up residence there. In addition to her first-hand knowledge of Xen'drik, she is one of the few nondragons to have made extensive study of the Draconic Prophecy. She sometimes sends adventurers on missions by uttering a cryptic prophecy. \"It is time for the Globe of Seven Lights to be brought out of Xen'drik,\" she might say. She never explains her proclamations, and never provides information on mundane affairs.": "{@b Flamewind}. 两年前，一个拥有神力的雌性动物随Xen'drik探险队回到了莫格莱夫大学，并在那里居住下来。除了对Xen'drik的第一手资料外，她还是少数对Draconic预言进行过广泛研究的非龙人之一。她有时会通过说出一个神秘的预言来派遣冒险者执行任务。她可能会说：\"现在是把七彩光球带出Xen'drik的时候了\"。她从不解释她的预言，也不提供有关世俗事务的信息。",
	"{@b Faerie Court}. Somewhere deep in the western forest of the Eldeen Reaches lies the Twilight Demesne, where powerful archfey hold court over an ongoing revelry. It often appears as if nothing more than mischief and caprice governs the actions of the archfey, but they have ancient interests in the mortal world—as well as extensive rivalries among themselves.": "{@b Faerie Court}. 在Eldeen Reaches西部森林深处的某个地方，有一个暮光之城，在那里，强大的大法师们正在举行狂欢。看起来似乎只有恶作剧和任性才能支配大法官的行动，但他们在凡人世界有古老的利益，以及他们之间广泛的竞争。",

	"Your party works for an agency offering investigative services, or you might run your own firm as a group. Inquisitives put their keen minds and dogged determination to use unraveling mysteries. Inquisitive agencies run the gamut from private investigators to networks of detectives supported by dragonmarked houses.": "你们一行人在一个提供调查服务的机构工作，或者你们可能作为一个团体经营自己的公司。探究者将他们敏锐的头脑和坚定的决心用于揭开谜团。调查机构的范围很广，从私人调查员到由龙纹屋支持的侦探网络。",
	"Across Khorvaire, the inquisitives of House Tharashk have a reputation for discretion and cunning. Members of that house operate the Finders Guild, a loose collection of independent inquisitive agencies. Dragonmarked heirs of House Tharashk own and operate some of these agencies, but each employs unmarked inquisitives as well, leaving the heirs free to take on the most difficult cases. A connection with the Finders Guild is viewed as a mark of high quality, a guarantee that a particular agency numbers among the best in the business.": "在整个Khorvaire，Tharashk家族的调查员以谨慎和狡猾著称。该家族的成员经营着 \"发现者协会\"，这是一个独立调查机构的松散集合。塔拉什克家族的龙纹继承人拥有并经营其中一些机构，但每个机构也都雇佣了无纹章的审问者，让继承人自由地处理最棘手的案件。与探索者协会的联系被视为高质量的标志，是对某一机构在业务上名列前茅的保证。",
	"In the city of Sharn alone, four inquisitives with the Mark of Finding lead agencies in different parts of the city: Kurt Karr'Aashta's Investigations in the neighborhood of Deathsgate, Information Acquisition in Underlook, Thuranne Velderan's Investigative Services in Warden Towers, and Globe Information Agency in Dragon Towers.

	"In yet another embarrassing blow to the Fairhaven Watch, renowned inquisitive \"Feather\" Fallester has apparently solved yet another case she randomly pulled from the watch's files of unsolved mysteries.

	"While the Finders' Guild's greatest strength is its internal connections, it lacks many strong allies beyond House Tharashk's holdings. That said, the following groups have had numerous interactions with the guild and generally view inquisitives in a positive light:": "虽然探究者协会最大的优势在于其内部联系，但在塔拉什克家族的领地之外，它缺乏许多强有力的盟友。尽管如此，以下团体已经与该公会进行了多次互动，并普遍以积极的态度看待探询者。",
	"{@b Droaam}. Since the rise of the Daughters of Sora Kell in Droaam, members of House Tharashk have served as intermediaries between the realm of monsters and the east, bartering the services of monstrous mercenaries across Khorvaire. The house takes great pride in having forced mainstream Khorvaire to recognize that orcs and half-orcs are worthy of the same courtesies and opportunities as races long established in society, and house members are now using their status to do the same for various other races from Droaam. As a result, members of the Finders' Guild can expect at least a modicum of respect while traveling in Droaam": "{@b Droaam}. 自从索拉-凯尔的女儿们在德拉姆崛起后，塔拉什克家族的成员就成为了怪物王国和东方之间的中间人，在整个霍尔韦尔以怪物雇佣兵的服务进行交换。该家族非常自豪地迫使霍尔韦尔的主流社会认识到，兽人和半兽人值得获得与社会上长期存在的种族一样的礼遇和机会，而且该家族成员现在正利用他们的地位，为来自德拉姆的其他各种种族做同样的事。因此，寻找者协会的成员在德罗安旅行时，至少可以期待得到适度的尊重。",
	"{@b Gatekeepers}. House Tharashk and the druidic sect of the Gatekeepers share common origins in the Shadow Marches, and the druids remain friendly with the house and its Finders' Guild. In the Marches, the guild often helps the druids locate stray aberrations and open portals between planes of existence. For their part, the Gatekeepers offer the support of their magic to aid guild members in whatever ways they can.": "{@b Gatekeepers}. Tharashk家族和守门人的德鲁伊教派在阴影地带有着共同的起源，德鲁伊与该家族及其寻找者公会保持着友好关系。在马尔奇，该公会经常帮助德鲁伊找到游离的畸变体，并打开各存在平面之间的传送门。守门人则提供他们的魔法支持，以任何方式帮助公会成员。",
	"The work of inquisitives naturally creates enemies, mostly on a local scale: con artists, gangs, and others who have had their unsavory deeds uncovered. Such groups are inclined to hold grudges against the guild as a whole. The guild's enemies on a larger scale are few, but include the following groups.": "调查员的工作自然会产生敌人，主要是在当地范围内：骗子、帮派，以及其他被揭发了不光彩行为的人。这些团体倾向于对整个行会怀恨在心。公会在更大范围内的敌人很少，但包括以下群体。",
	"{@b Daask}. The Finders Guild has a difficult relationship with the criminal organization called Daask. On the one hand, Daask is a violent criminal gang whose members are often targeted by Finders Guild inquisitives. On the other hand, Daask is a gang of monsters, many of whom actually left Droaam under the auspices of House Tharashk. Finders Guild inquisitives who pry too deeply into Daask business often feel pressure to back away coming from higher in House Tharashk. Those who ignore that pressure tend to end up the targets of Daask assassins.": "{@b Daask}. 寻找者协会与名为Daask的犯罪组织有着艰难的关系。一方面，达斯克是一个暴力犯罪团伙，其成员经常成为寻找者协会调查员的目标。另一方面，达斯克是一个由怪物组成的团伙，其中许多人实际上是在塔拉什克家族的支持下离开德罗阿姆的。寻找者协会的调查员如果对达斯克的业务探究得太深，往往会感到来自塔拉什克家族高层的压力而退缩。那些无视这种压力的人最终会成为达斯克刺客的目标。",
	"{@b House Deneith}. For centuries, House Deneith cornered the market on mercenary forces in Khorvaire. It was an unpleasant surprise for them when House Tharashk entered the mercenary market in the later days of the war, bringing monsters from Droaam to bolster Five Nations armies. House Deneith still resents House Tharashk for this, and the animosity between the houses only increases when Finders' Guild inquisitives stick their noses into Sentinel Marshal business.": "{@b House Deneith}. 几个世纪以来，Deneith家族垄断了Khorvaire的雇佣军市场。当Tharashk家族在战争后期进入雇佣兵市场，从Droaam带来怪物以加强五国军队时，这对他们来说是一个不愉快的惊喜。迪尼斯家族至今仍对塔拉什克家族心怀怨恨，而当发现者协会的调查员将他们的鼻子伸向哨兵元帅的生意时，两族之间的敌意只会增加。",
	"With an inquisitive agency as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "有一个充满好奇心的机构作为你的团体的赞助人，你会获得以下好处。",
	"{@b Compensation}. You can collect fees from your clients when you undertake investigations on their behalf. You can set those fees, and clients will often pay higher fees as your reputation and prestige increase. A fee of 5 sp to 10 sp per inquisitive per day, plus expenses incurred as part of the investigation, is a reasonable starting rate.": "{@b Compensation}. 当你代表客户进行调查时，你可以从客户那里收取费用。你可以设定这些费用，随着你的声誉和声望的提高，客户往往会支付更高的费用。每位调查员每天的费用为5-10英镑，加上调查过程中产生的费用，这是一个合理的起始费率。",
	"{@b Contacts}. Through the Finders' Guild, each associated inquisitive agency can benefit from the knowledge and experience of not only other inquisitives, but also bounty hunters, explorers, dragonshard prospectors, and others who make use of House Tharashk's talent for finding. Thus, an affiliated agency might find helpful allies not only in cities throughout the Five Nations, but even in remote corners of the wilderness where trackers and prospectors ply their trade. At the DM's discretion, your contacts might direct you to new cases, offer you leads in the case you're working on, put you in touch with their own network of contacts, or show up suddenly to pull you out of the fire. You can call in a favor from your agency to draw on the resources of any of your contacts. At the start of the campaign, roll twice on the Contacts table to choose two contacts. You will certainly acquire new contacts in the course of your adventures, who might or might not fit the descriptions of contacts on this table.": "{@b Contacts}. 通过寻找者协会，每个相关的探究机构不仅可以从其他探究者的知识和经验中获益，还可以从赏金猎人、探险家、龙石勘探者以及其他利用塔拉什克家族的寻找天赋的人那里获益。因此，一个附属机构不仅可以在整个五国的城市中找到有用的盟友，甚至还可以在追踪者和勘探者从事贸易的偏远荒野角落中找到。根据DM的判断，你的联系人可能会把你引向新的案件，为你正在处理的案件提供线索，让你与他们自己的关系网取得联系，或者突然出现，把你从火中拉出来。你可以请你的机构帮忙，利用你的任何联系人的资源。在活动开始时，在联系人表上滚动两次，选择两个联系人。在你的冒险过程中，你肯定会获得新的联系人，他们可能符合也可能不符合这张表格中对联系人的描述。",

	"A wide variety of talents can be useful in the work of an inquisitive, leading the Finders' Guild to employ specialists with diverse skill sets.

Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:": "各种各样的才能在探究者的工作中都是有用的，这导致探究者协会雇佣了具有不同技能的专家。许多探究者的背景是罪犯、贤者、士兵或顽童，无论他们在一个团体中扮演什么角色。可以考虑为你的队伍中的角色设置一些或所有这些角色。",
	"{@b Client}. When a routine investigation goes sideways, sometimes innocents get unwillingly caught in the action. The common artisan who hired the party to find her missing partner might find herself and her hired inquisitives on the run when things take a deadly turn. Such a Client is often a nonplayer character whose connection with the party is dissolved at the end of an adventure, but sometimes a Client develops a taste for excitement and becomes a fixture in the campaign. A perfectly ordinary background such as guild artisan or folk hero often work well with this character, who otherwise needs no specific proficiencies or capabilities.": "{@b Client}. 当常规调查出现偏差时，有时无辜者会不情愿地被卷入这场行动。当事情出现致命的转变时，雇佣团队寻找失踪伙伴的普通工匠可能会发现自己和她雇佣的调查员正在逃亡。这样的客户通常是一个非玩家角色，在冒险结束时，他与队伍的联系就会被解除，但有时客户会发展出对刺激的兴趣，并成为活动中的一个固定角色。一个完全普通的背景，如行会工匠或民间英雄，往往能很好地配合这个角色，否则他不需要特殊的技能或能力。",
	"{@b Consultant}. Sometimes skilled individuals end up working alongside inquisitives for a time. Such Consultants might work for a newspaper, study an esoteric field, or write crime fiction for a living. This character is usually similar to an Investigator, but typically has an unusual background or expert knowledge. The relationship between a Consultant and the rest of the party can be a source of drama—or comedy.": "{@b Consultant}. 有时，有技能的人最终会与探究者一起工作一段时间。这样的顾问可能为报纸工作，研究一个深奥的领域，或者以写犯罪小说为生。这种人物通常与调查员相似，但通常有不寻常的背景或专家知识。顾问和其他成员之间的关系可以是戏剧性的来源，也可以是喜剧性的。",
	"{@b Interrogator}. The Interrogator specializes in interaction with suspects, witnesses, or others who need persuasion to reveal what they know.

	"{@b Investigator}. Investigators piece evidence into a coherent whole that explains a mystery.

	"{@b Tough}. An inquisitive's work is inherently dangerous, so it's often important for their group to include someone who can physically intervene when situations devolve into combat. The Tough's role might include fighting criminal thugs, kicking in doors, and even roughing up suspects, all of which suggests a high Strength score and combat ability. The {@skill Intimidation} skill can also helpfully supplement the Tough's work.": "{@b Tough}. 探究者的工作本质上是危险的，所以他们的小组中往往要有一个能在情况演变成战斗时进行身体干预的人。强硬派的角色可能包括打击犯罪分子，踢门，甚至粗暴对待嫌疑人，所有这些都表明他们有较高的力量得分和战斗能力。{@skill Intimidation}技能也可以帮助补充强悍者的工作。",
	"Much of the work done by inquisitives is relatively mundane: collecting evidence of marital infidelity, investigating insurance fraud, or finding runaways. Sometimes these relatively innocent investigations can lead into the shadowy underbelly of society and become more dangerous, but most adventurers prefer the more dangerous kinds of inquisitive work. Your group might specialize in one particular kind of work, or it might take whatever cases come its way. Roll or pick from the Investigative Expertise table to determine your agency's specialty.": "调查员所做的大部分工作都是相对平凡的：收集婚姻不忠的证据，调查保险欺诈，或寻找逃亡者。有时，这些相对无害的调查会引向社会的阴暗面，变得更加危险，但大多数冒险家更喜欢更危险的调查工作。你的团队可能会专门从事一种特殊的工作，也可能会接下任何案件。从调查专长表中选择，以确定你的机构的专长。",

	"Inquisitives occupy a significant place in the popular imagination, both in their real-life exploits (as reported in the newspapers) and in many fictionalized accounts. As romanticized heroes of many tales, they shed the light of truth into the shadows to uncover secret misdeeds.

	"{@b King's Citadel}. Part spy, part inquisitive, and part soldier, the agents of the King's Citadel serve crown and country as the ultimate agency for dispensing the king's justice in Breland. Local watches and constabularies can call on its agents when a crime or situation poses a threat that spreads beyond their jurisdiction.": "{@b King's Citadel}. 国王城堡的特工部分是间谍，部分是调查员，部分是士兵，他们为王室和国家服务，是在布雷兰德执行国王司法的最终机构。当犯罪或情况构成的威胁超出其管辖范围时，当地的守望者和警署可以向其代理人求助。",
	"{@b Sentinel Marshals}. The Sentinel Marshals are a multinational force administered by House Deneith and authorized to enforce the law across Khorvaire. As the only force that can cross borders in pursuit of fugitives, they are well trained to track renegades.": "{@b Sentinel Marshals}. 哨兵法警是一支由Deneith家族管理的多国部队，被授权在整个Khorvaire执行法律。作为唯一一支可以跨越国界追捕逃犯的部队，他们在追踪叛徒方面训练有素。",
	"{@b Sharn Watch}. Like most local police forces of any size, the Sharn Watch includes inquisitives devoted to solving crimes and tracking down the perpetrators.": "{@b Sharn Watch}. 像大多数任何规模的地方警察部队一样，沙恩观察站包括致力于破案和追踪犯罪者的调查员。",
	"{@b Warning Guild}. Affiliated with but largely independent from House Medani, the Warning Guild provides certification and contract employment for bodyguards, inquisitives, and sentries across Khorvaire. The guild emphasizes the use of logic, perception, and deduction to assemble fragments of evidence into a recognizable whole. Its inquisitives are often called upon to solve mysteries that baffle local law enforcement.": "{@b Warning Guild}. 警告公会隶属于梅达尼家族，但在很大程度上独立于梅达尼家族，为整个霍尔韦尔的保镖、调查员和哨兵提供认证和合同雇佣。该公会强调使用逻辑、感知和推理，将证据的碎片组合成一个可识别的整体。它的调查员经常被要求解决那些令当地执法部门困惑的谜团。",
	"{@b Running Your Own}. Rather than join an existing inquisitive agency, you can start your own. You need to establish your own office. You can collect the same fees as if you worked for another agency, and you have access to the same range of contacts. You can also use the Running a Business downtime activity to direct the activities of your agency, as described at the start of this section.": "{@b Running Your Own}. 与其加入一个现有的探究机构，不如自己创业。你需要建立自己的办公室。你可以收取与为其他机构工作相同的费用，而且你可以获得相同范围的联系。你也可以使用 \"经营企业 \"的停工活动来指导你的机构的活动，如本节开头所述。",
	"Your group serves as a team of soldiers in a larger military force, one dedicated to combat missions or other dangerous tasks. You could be a team of mercenaries, a special forces unit, or an ordinary squad of infantry. Perhaps you protect a nation's people from monsters, or even continue to fight the Last War in the shadows. There is plenty of work for military forces at the edges of civilization, such as protecting the Eldeen Reaches from the dangers of the Demon Marches or skirmishing with Droaam at the borders of Breland.": "你的小组在一个更大的军事力量中充当一个士兵小组，一个专门执行战斗任务或其他危险任务的小组。你可以是一队雇佣兵，一支特种部队，或者一个普通的步兵小队。也许你保护一个国家的人民不受怪物的侵害，甚至继续在暗处进行最后的战争。在文明的边缘有很多军事力量的工作，比如保护Eldeen Reaches免受恶魔地带的危险，或者在Breland的边界与Droaam短兵相接。",
	"The soldiers of the Redcloak Battalion number among the deadliest warriors in Breland. When a situation calls for extreme military force, law enforcers turn to the Redcloak Battalion. This elite unit fought at the forefront of the Last War, and Brelish bards still sing of the exploits of Khandan the Hammer and Meira the Huntress. At the end of the war, the battalion was split up and its units assigned to cities and strongholds across Breland.": "红斗篷营的士兵是布雷兰德最致命的战士之一。当情况需要极端的军事力量时，执法者会求助于红环营。这支精英部队在最后的战争中战斗在最前线，布瑞利什的吟游诗人仍在歌颂锤子坎丹和女猎手梅拉的功绩。战争结束后，该营被拆分，其部队被分配到布瑞尔各地的城市和据点。",
	"As an elite group of special forces, the Redcloaks don't include inexperienced adventurers in their ranks. Considering that, there are two ways to use the Redcloak Battalion as a group patron.": "作为一个精英的特种部队，红环组织不包括没有经验的冒险者在他们的队伍中。考虑到这一点，有两种方法可以将红斗篷营作为一个团体赞助人。",
	"First, the Redcloaks do sometimes take inexperienced adventurers under their wings. Existing Redcloaks proved themselves on the battlefields of the Last War; if the group is to continue, the Redcloaks of the future have to learn the soldier's trade in different battles. To such ends, senior members of the battalion send your party on missions across Khorvaire to provide you with combat experience as well as to further Redcloak goals.": "首先，红环会有时确实会把没有经验的冒险者纳入他们的麾下。现有的红环会成员在最后一次战争的战场上证明了自己；如果该组织要继续下去，未来的红环会成员必须在不同的战斗中学习士兵的技能。为了达到这样的目的，营里的高级成员会派你的队伍在整个霍尔韦尔执行任务，为你提供战斗经验，并进一步实现红环会的目标。",
	"As part of Breland's military forces, the Redcloaks can count on the support of the crown, the King's Citadel, and the larger Brelish army, largely summarized as the following parties:": "作为布雷兰军事力量的一部分，红衣军团可以依靠王室、国王城堡和更大的布雷兰军队的支持，主要概括为以下几方面。",
	"{@b King Boranel}. The king of Breland is a cautious advocate of the Redcloaks. He values their contributions but fears their power, which is why he divided the battalion after the end of the war. Still, he rewards loyalty among the Redcloaks by showing loyalty to them in return. Again and again, he has proven himself willing to exercise his power on behalf of a loyal Redcloak.": "{@b King Boranel}. 布雷兰德的国王是红袍人的谨慎拥护者。他重视他们的贡献，但害怕他们的力量，这就是为什么他在战争结束后分化了营队。不过，他还是通过对红环会的忠诚作为回报来奖励他们的忠诚。他一次又一次地证明自己愿意为忠诚的红袍人行使他的权力。",
	"{@b Other Redcloaks}. The first place any Redcloak turns for help is another Redcloak. No one else is as reliable and competent, while being unerringly faithful to the Brelish king and the battalion. Every Redcloak readily provides aid to other members, with no questions asked and no favor expected in return.": "{@b Other Redcloaks}. 任何红袍人首先求助的地方是另一个红袍人。没有人像其他人那样可靠和有能力，同时对布雷利什国王和营队毫不动摇地忠诚。每个红斗篷人都乐意为其他成员提供帮助，不问任何问题，也不期待回报。",
	"As veterans of the Last War, many Redcloaks carry strong grudges against other nations. They tend to believe that the Treaty of Thronehold is merely an intermission in the ongoing conflict, and soon enough King Boranel will take his proper place on the throne of a reunited Galifar. Many of these grudges are personal based on an individual soldier's experience in the war, but some of them run both ways. Among the Redcloaks, tensions still run hot regarding their former rivals, particularly those from the following nations:": "作为最后战争的老兵，许多红袍人对其他国家怀有强烈的怨恨。他们倾向于认为《王座条约》只是正在进行的冲突中的一个中场休息，很快博拉内尔国王就会在重新统一的加利法尔的王座上获得他应有的地位。这些怨恨中有许多是基于个别士兵在战争中的经历而产生的个人恩怨，但有些是双向的。在红袍人中，对于他们以前的对手，特别是来自以下国家的对手，紧张关系仍然很激烈。",
	"{@b Darguun}. The hobgoblins of Darguun fought alongside Brelish forces at the Battle of Cairn Hill, but the cordial relations between the two nations frayed immediately after. The Redcloaks skirmished with hobgoblins who were leading Thrane civilians in chains back to Darguun. Few Darguuls remember the skirmish itself, but the \"wicked red-cloaked Brelish\" have an established place in the goblinoids' collective memory—and many Redcloaks do remember the event bitterly.": "{@b Darguun}. 达尔古恩的妖精在凯恩山战役中与布瑞利什的部队并肩作战，但两国之间的友好关系紧接着就破裂了。红袍人与霍比特人发生了短兵相接，霍比特人正带着被锁链锁住的瑟兰平民返回达尔古恩。很少有达尔古尔人记得这场战斗本身，但 \"邪恶的红袍布雷利什 \"在地精们的集体记忆中占有一席之地--许多红袍人确实痛苦地记得这个事件。",
	"{@b Thrane}. In the waning years of the Last War, the Redcloaks played a major role in the devastating Battle of Cairn Hill between Brelish and Thrane forces. Thanks to heavy losses on both sides, veterans of that battle tend to nurse bitter grudges against their enemies.": "{@b Thrane}. 在最后一次战争即将结束的时候，红袍人在布雷利什和瑟兰军队之间毁灭性的凯恩山之战中发挥了重要作用。由于双方都损失惨重，那场战役的老兵们往往对他们的敌人怀有痛苦的怨恨。",
	"With a military force as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "如果有一支军队作为你的团体的赞助人，你会获得以下好处。",
	"{@b Accommodations}. You can always find a place to stay and meals on a base or fort connected to your military force. Your accommodations are appropriate to your rank and station, but never luxurious.": "{@b Accommodations}. 你总能在与你的军队有关的基地或要塞找到住宿和吃饭的地方。你的住宿条件与你的军衔和职位相称，但绝不是豪华的。",
	"Venturing unusually far from their accustomed territory in the eastern jungles, a band of enormous lizardfolk—described by local experts as members of the Blackscale Tribe—broke through the fortifications at Adderport and killed thirteen residents before retreating back into the jungles. Khalar d'Tharashk has announced a plan to track the perpetrators and exact retribution under the sponsorship of King Sebastes.": "一群巨大的蜥蜴人--被当地专家描述为黑鳞部落的成员--不寻常地远离了他们在东部丛林中的习惯领地，冲破了阿德波特的防御工事，杀死了13名居民，然后退回到丛林中。卡勒-达拉什克（Khalar d'Tharashk）宣布了一项计划，在塞巴斯蒂安国王的支持下，追踪肇事者并实施报复。",
	"{@b Chain of Command}. You are part of a rigid chain of command. In addition to providing you with orders, this structure reduces your responsibility for your own actions. If you land in trouble in your own nation, you answer to your officers, not local law enforcement.": "{@b Chain of Command}. 你是一个僵化的指挥系统的一部分。除了为你提供命令外，这种结构还减少了你对自己行为的责任。如果你在自己的国家遇到麻烦，你要对你的官员负责，而不是对当地执法部门负责。",
	"{@b Orders}. You undertake your missions at the direction of a commanding officer. Your absolute obedience is expected. These missions are often explicit, leading you into the path of adventure. In some cases, though, you might be trusted with more open-ended tasks that afford you more leeway in interpreting orders.": "{@b Orders}. 你们在指挥员的指导下执行任务。预计你会绝对服从。这些任务通常是明确的，引导你进入冒险的道路。但在某些情况下，你可能会被信任，承担更多的开放式任务，使你在解释命令时有更多的余地。",
	"{@b Salary}. Each member of your group is paid a regular salary. The amount varies depending on your organization and your position within it, but at minimum you enjoy a modest lifestyle. You might receive a small salary (as little as 1 sp per day) but also receive food and housing on a military base. Or you could receive 1 gp per day but rely on that money for room and board. With higher rank comes commensurately higher pay. As an officer, you can maintain a comfortable lifestyle.": "{@b Salary}. 你们小组的每个成员都有固定工资。数额因你的组织和你在其中的地位而异，但至少你享有适度的生活方式。你可能会收到一份小的工资（少到每天1英镑），但也会在一个军事基地获得食物和住房。或者你可以每天收到1戈比，但依靠这些钱来获得食宿。随着军衔的提高，工资也相应提高。作为一名军官，你可以保持一种舒适的生活方式。",
	"A military unit, like most adventuring parties, incorporates a range of useful skills while covering each member's weaknesses with another's strengths. Thus, characters of any class can find a home in such a unit, and a diversity of different skills and backgrounds benefits the group as a whole. Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:": "一个军事单位，就像大多数冒险队伍一样，融合了一系列有用的技能，同时用另一个人的长处来弥补每个成员的弱点。因此，任何等级的角色都可以在这样的团队中找到归宿，不同技能和背景的多样性对整个团队都是有益的。考虑在你的队伍中扮演这些角色的一部分或全部。",
	"{@b Commander}. Every band of infantry has its leader, even if that person isn't a officer. The Commander earns that position through some combination of high Charisma and Intelligence—the ability to inspire and the capacity to plan. Proficiency in skills such as {@skill Persuasion} and {@skill History} can be helpful as well. The Commander might be a career soldier (with that background) or someone from a noble background placed in command by virtue of birth. A Commander might be a fighter, bard, cleric, paladin, or even wizard—as magic proves valuable in military engagements.": "{@b Commander}. 每支步兵队伍都有其领导者，即使这个人不是军官。指挥官通过高魅力和高智力的某种组合来赢得这个位置--激励的能力和计划的能力。熟练掌握{@skill Persuasion}和{@skill History}等技能也会有帮助。指挥官可能是一个职业军人（有这种背景），或者是一个出身高贵的人，因为出生而被置于指挥地位。指挥官可能是一个战士、吟游诗人、牧师、圣骑士，甚至是巫师--因为魔法在军事行动中证明是有价值的。",
	"{@b Scout}. Trained in navigating the wilderness and laying ambushes for enemy soldiers, the Scout melds the combat skill of a fighter with the skills of a ranger or rogue. High Dexterity and Wisdom scores, combined with proficiency in the {@skill Nature}, {@skill Perception}, {@skill Stealth}, and {@skill Survival} skills, support this character's core capabilities. Scouts are often recruited from people who are more familiar with the wilds than with city streets, including folk heroes, hermits, and outlanders.": "{@b Scout}. 侦察员接受过在野外航行和为敌方士兵设下埋伏的训练，他将战士的战斗技能与游侠或流氓的技能融为一体。高的灵巧和智慧分数，加上对{@skill Nature}、{@skill Perception}、{@skill Stealth}和{@skill Survival}技能的精通，支持了这个人物的核心能力。侦察员通常是从那些对荒野比城市街道更熟悉的人中招募的，包括民间英雄、隐士和外乡人。",
	"{@b Soldier}. Soldiers make up the core of most military groups, whether they're general infantry, magical artillery, or elite special forces. These characters come from all classes and backgrounds—for some, their background before joining the military is more important than their current role. No particular set of talents is common to all soldiers, but military units often strive to avoid duplication of skills.": "{@b Soldier}. 士兵构成了大多数军事团体的核心，无论他们是普通步兵、魔法炮兵，还是精英特种部队。这些角色来自各个阶层和背景--有些人在加入军队之前的背景比他们现在的角色更重要。没有哪一套特定的才能是所有士兵共有的，但军事单位往往努力避免技能的重复。",
	"{@b Warforged}. Literally made for war, most warforged characters have spent the years since the end of the Last War trying to find a new way of life. For some warforged, the answer is to continue fighting the war one way or another, often as part of an organized military unit. This experience, as a people created to fulfill a role and now seemingly locked into a destructive destiny, is just a part of life for many warforged.": "{@b Warforged}. 从字面上看，大多数战神角色都是为战争而生，在最后一次战争结束后的几年里，他们一直在努力寻找一种新的生活方式。对于一些战神来说，答案是继续以这种或那种方式参加战争，通常是作为一个有组织的军事单位的一部分。这种经历，作为一个为履行角色而创造的民族，现在似乎被锁定在一个破坏性的命运中，对许多战神来说只是生活的一部分。",
	"The work involved in serving as a military unit is wide-ranging. Your missions potentially run the risk of shattering the fragile peace established by the Treaty of Thronehold and plunging all of Khorvaire back into war. Alternatively, you might consider running your campaign during the Last War, so your group's missions influence the war effort and don't risk violating the treaty. As a group, consider the options on the Military Missions table and work with your DM to decide how the work you do fits into the larger picture of war and peace in Khorvaire.": "作为一个军事单位，所涉及的工作范围很广。你的任务有可能打破《王权条约》建立的脆弱的和平，使整个霍尔韦尔重新陷入战争。另外，你可以考虑在最后一次战争期间开展你的活动，这样你的小组的任务就会影响到战争的努力，并且不会有违反条约的风险。作为一个团体，考虑军事任务表上的选项，并与你的DM合作，决定你所做的工作如何融入霍尔韦尔的战争与和平的大环境中。",
	"{@b Strike Force}. You are trained to make quick, strategic, devastating attacks against enemy assets.": "{@b Strike Force}. 你被训练成对敌方资产进行快速、战略性、破坏性的攻击。",
	"{@b Special Forces}. You're trained in covert operations, similar to the work of spies but with more focus on combat.": "{@b Special Forces}. 你接受过秘密行动的训练，类似于间谍的工作，但更注重于战斗。",
	"{@b Defensive Operations}. Your focus is on protecting your allies from attackers, monsters, or deadlier enemies.": "{@b Defensive Operations}. 你的重点是保护你的盟友免受攻击者、怪物或更致命的敌人的伤害。",
	"{@b Reconnaissance}. Your missions involve keeping track of enemy troops and surveying potential battlefields.": "{@b Reconnaissance}. 你的任务包括跟踪敌军和勘察潜在战场。",
	"{@b Peacekeeping}. Your paradoxical task is to maintain the fragile peace of the Treaty of Thronehold by maintaining a military presence in turbulent areas.": "{@b Peacekeeping}. 你自相矛盾的任务是通过在动荡地区保持军事存在来维护《王权条约》脆弱的和平。",
	"{@b Warforged Affairs}. You are responsible for hunting down berserk warforged, working in the gray spaces between national order and a people seeking their destiny.": "{@b Warforged Affairs}. 你负责追捕狂暴的战神，在国家秩序和寻求自己命运的人民之间的灰色空间工作。",
	"You were there at a crucial moment that turned the tide of the Last War. Choose or roll an option on the Defining Mission table to determine what that moment was.": "在扭转最后战争局势的关键时刻，你就在那里。在定义任务表上选择或滚动一个选项，以确定那个时刻是什么。",
	"{@b Heroic Stand}. You knew if you took one step back from the line, all would be lost. When relief arrived days later, you had not budged.": "{@b Heroic Stand}. 你知道如果你从线上退一步，就会失去一切。几天后，当救济到来时，你没有动弹。",
	"{@b Telling Blow}. The enemy general never knew what hit them. You still carry their personal flag as a trophy.": "{@b Telling Blow}. 敌人的将军永远不知道什么东西打中了他们。你仍然带着他们的个人旗帜作为战利品。",
	"{@b Dawn Raid}. You traveled hundreds of miles around enemy lines to reach your target. In a single day, months of enemy preparation went up in flames.": "{@b Dawn Raid}. 你绕过敌人的防线数百英里，到达你的目标。在一天之内，敌人几个月的准备工作化为乌有。",

	"{@b Necromancer}. You lost a lot of friends in battle, but what made it worse was watching that cackling wizard raise them as zombies and turn them against you.": "{@b Necromancer}. 你在战斗中失去了很多朋友，但更糟糕的是看着那个咯咯笑的巫师把他们养成僵尸，并让他们反对你。",
	"{@b Camp Commandant}. As prisoners of war, you were captured and subjected to brutal conditions in a prisoner camp. The commandant delighted in your pain.": "{@b Camp Commandant}. 作为战俘，你们被俘并在战俘营中遭受残酷的条件。司令官以你们的痛苦为乐。",

Deneith家族通过其Blademarks公会管理整个Khorvaire的雇佣兵活动，家族成员担任军官、训练员和战略家。公会的普通士兵主要是人类雇佣兵，但也包括大量来自达尔古恩的妖精、来自瓦伦纳的精灵以及不再为国家而战的锡兰士兵。",
	"{@b Maruk Ghaash'kala}. Among the orc tribes of the Demon Wastes, the Maruk tribe inhabits the deadly Labyrinth that lies between the wastes and the Eldeen Reaches.

	"{@b Valenar}. The elves of Valenar have no interest in peace, but they participated in the talks that led to the Treaty of Thronehold to gauge the measure of their enemies and gain acceptance in the human courts. Today, Valenar forces continue to raid the Talenta Plains and Q'barra on a regular basis, in stark defiance of the Treaty of Thronehold. A Valenar warband is unlikely to contain members of races other than elves and perhaps half-elves, but such a band could make an interesting military party.": "{@b Valenar}. 瓦勒纳的精灵们对和平没有兴趣，但他们参加了导致《王座条约》的会谈，以衡量他们的敌人，并获得人类法庭的认可。今天，瓦伦纳人的部队继续定期突袭塔伦塔平原和卡巴拉，完全无视《王权条约》。瓦伦纳人的战队不太可能包含精灵和半精灵以外的种族成员，但这样的战队可以成为一个有趣的军事团体。",

	"{@i Voice} reporters have uncovered the names and positions of several members of this board, and the results are nothing less than shocking. The Trust—the shadowy secret police who maintain order in Zilargo—is well represented on this board, raising questions about the extent to which the {@i Chronicle} is a propaganda engine for Zilargo. Worse still, several of the wealthiest and most influential members of the board are associated with the Aurum, a shadowy cabal whose primary interest seems to be increasing its members' wealth and influence. Whose interest, then, does the {@i Chronicle} serve?": "{@i Voice}的记者发现了这个委员会几个成员的名字和职位，结果是非常令人震惊的。信托会--维持Zilargo秩序的阴暗的秘密警察--在这个委员会中占有很高的比例，让人怀疑{@i Chronicle}是Zilargo的一个宣传引擎。更糟糕的是，董事会中几个最富有和最有影响力的成员与Aurum有关，Aurum是一个阴暗的集团，其主要利益似乎是增加其成员的财富和影响力。那么，{@i Chronicle}为谁的利益服务？",

This might be a challenging role for a player character to fill, but an NPC could provide services to the party, making them worth keeping around.": "{@b Civilian}. 有些团体中的成员，他们的技能对报告很有帮助，但在冒险中却不那么有用。这可能是指定的作家，政治漫画家，或记录党的冒险的记录者。对于玩家角色来说，这可能是一个具有挑战性的角色，但NPC可以为队伍提供服务，使他们值得留在身边。",
	"{@b Muscle}. Sometimes sources need a bit of physical cajoling to share their stories. The Muscle has a knack for getting people to talk. Alternatively, when those in power lock away the truth, the Muscle physically wrestles it free. Any character who's proficient with armor and martial weapons (such as a fighter) makes a fine choice for this role. Characters in this role are often former soldiers or more-or-less reformed criminals.": "{@b Muscle}. 有时，消息来源需要一点身体上的劝说来分享他们的故事。肌肉男有一种让人开口说话的诀窍。另外，当那些有权力的人把真相锁起来的时候，肌肉男会用身体把它挣脱出来。任何精通盔甲和武术武器的人物（如战士）都是这个角色的最佳选择。这个角色的人物通常是前士兵或差不多改过自新的罪犯。",
	"{@b Networker}. The Networker knows exactly who can get the party what they need. This character makes extensive use of contacts and friends to facilitate the party's work. A character with the criminal background likely has underworld contacts, while an urchin could be familiar with the ins and outs of the city. Interpersonal connections are typically more important than any particular skills or abilities for this character, although many Networkers have high Charisma scores.": "{@b Networker}. 网络者清楚地知道谁能为党派提供他们所需要的东西。这个人物广泛利用联系人和朋友来促进党的工作。一个有犯罪背景的人物可能有黑社会的关系，而一个顽童可能熟悉城市的内部和外部。对这种人物来说，人际关系通常比任何特定的技能或能力更重要，尽管许多网络人有很高的魅力分数。",

You also have the privilege of using a knightly honorific before your name (typically \"sir\" or \"lady\"), and you are immediately recognized as a knight, an agent of the church, and effectively a lesser member of Thrane's aristocracy.

The commanders try to keep each other informed about where knights are operating and what they are doing, but this system works better in some places—and between some commanders—than others.": "圣殿骑士可以自由地在世界范围内游荡，追求骑士团的目标。当离开一位指挥官的管辖范围而进入另一位指挥官的管辖范围时，骑士有责任及时向新地区的指挥官报告，以防该指挥官迫切需要骑士执行任务。指挥官们试图让对方了解骑士在哪里行动以及他们在做什么，但这个系统在一些地方和一些指挥官之间比其他地方更有效。",

Or is she there simply so that Sir Baerdren can keep his eye on her and ensure that she doesn't sabotage the templars from within?": "奥菲亚女士之所以能保持她的崇高地位，是因为她的忠诚、她的虔诚和她的资质吗？还是说她在那里只是为了让贝尔德伦爵士能盯着她，确保她不会从内部破坏圣殿骑士团？",
	"{@b Fixer}. The Fixer might work for a religious order for entirely non-religious reasons. This character does the order's dirty work and clears away its problems. It's entirely possible for an entire party to be made up of Fixers, but rogues and fighters are especially well suited to this kind of work. Characters with the criminal background excel at putting their skills and contacts to use on the church's behalf.": "{@b Fixer}. 修复者可能出于完全非宗教的原因为宗教组织工作。这个角色做教团的脏活累活，清除它的问题。整个党派完全有可能由修复者组成，但流氓和战士特别适合这种工作。具有犯罪背景的人物擅长于将他们的技能和关系用于教会的工作。",
	"{@b Prophet}. The Prophet is a visionary with a more-or-less direct connection to the divine. This character might be the driving force behind the group's quests, steering them according to divine will. Proficiency in skills such as {@skill Insight} and {@skill Religion} can help reflect this character's divine connection. The Prophet is often a cleric or druid, but could also be an NPC with no real adventuring skills, who needs the group's protection.": "{@b Prophet}. 先知是一个有远见的人，或多或少与神灵有直接联系。这个人物可能是团体任务背后的驱动力，根据神的意志引导他们。熟练掌握{@skill Insight}和{@skill Religion}等技能可以帮助反映这个人物的神性联系。先知通常是一个牧师或德鲁伊，但也可能是一个没有真正冒险技能的NPC，他需要团体的保护。",
	"{@b Teacher}. Those in this role spread the teachings of the faith. This isn't usually an effort to win converts—though it can be, especially in the case of the Church of the Silver Flame—but rather the task of encouraging people to live according to the highest ideals of faith. Proficiency in skills such as {@skill Persuasion} (or sometimes {@skill Intimidation}) and {@skill Religion} can be useful for this character. Many clerics fill this role, but devout bards can also be effective Teachers. Some Teachers bring skills from the entertainer background into the service of their faith.": "{@b Teacher}. 这个角色的人传播信仰的教义。这通常不是为了赢得皈依者--尽管它可以，特别是在银焰教会的情况下--而是鼓励人们按照信仰的最高理想生活的任务。熟练掌握{@skill Persuasion}（有时是{@skill Intimidation}）和{@skill Religion}等技能对这个角色很有用。许多牧师扮演这个角色，但虔诚的吟游诗人也可以成为有效的教师。有些教师将艺人背景的技能带入他们的信仰服务中。",
	"{@b Zealot}. Dedicated to smiting the foes of the faith, the Zealot focuses on combat above all. Clerics, druids, and paladins make iconic Zealots, but any character can play this role; there are barbarians whose fury is fueled by their devotion, and rangers sworn to track down the enemies of the faith. The soldier and folk hero backgrounds are well suited to such champions of the faith.": "{@b Zealot}. 狂热者致力于打击信仰的敌人，他的重点是战斗。牧师、德鲁伊和圣骑士是典型的狂热者，但任何角色都可以扮演这个角色；有野蛮人，他们的怒火被他们的奉献所激发，还有游侠发誓要追踪信仰的敌人。士兵和民间英雄的背景很适合于这种信仰的拥护者。",
	"What is the nature of your work for the religious order? As a group, consult the Religious Service table and work with your DM to decide what role you play—which likely shapes the kind of adventures you undertake.": "你为教团工作的性质是什么？作为一个小组，请查阅宗教服务表，并与你的管理员一起决定你所扮演的角色--这很可能决定了你所进行的冒险的种类。",

	"{@b Fight for Freedom}. You protect the downtrodden from the forces of oppression.": "{@b Fight for Freedom}. 你保护受压迫者免受压迫的力量。",
	"{@b Retrieval}. Your group seeks sacred relics and holy artifacts on behalf of your church.": "{@b Retrieval}. 你的团体代表你的教会寻找神圣的遗物和圣物。",
	"{@b Root Out Corruption}. You are charged with finding corruption within the hierarchy of your own faith.": "{@b Root Out Corruption}. 你负责在你自己信仰的等级制度中寻找腐败。",
	"{@b Exhortation}. You work with the faithful at a grassroots level to get them to uphold their high ideals.": "{@b Exhortation}. 你在基层与信众一起工作，让他们坚持自己的崇高理想。",
	"{@b Dirty Work}. As the radical zealots of your order, you sin so the other members of the order don't have to.": "{@b Dirty Work}. 作为你们教团的激进狂热分子，你们犯罪是为了让教团的其他成员不必犯罪。",
	"Some religious orders are viewed with suspicion by the priestly hierarchies of their faiths; others are viewed as champions who act as the gods' hands in the world. Within a religious order, some members are highly respected while others are seen as dangerous for one reason or another. What is your relationship to the hierarchy you're a part of? Is your entire order held in particularly high or low esteem? Or does your adventuring party stand out from the larger order for some reason? Is your behavior in line with the expectations of your religion, or is it unorthodox in some way? Reference the Order Reputation table to determine how you're viewed by your larger religious institution.": "一些宗教团体被其信仰的牧师等级制度所怀疑；另一些则被视为冠军，在世界范围内充当神的手。在一个宗教团体中，一些成员受到高度尊重，而另一些则因为这样或那样的原因被视为危险人物。你与你所在的等级制度的关系是什么？你的整个教团受到特别高或特别低的尊重吗？或者你的冒险队伍由于某种原因而从大的秩序中脱颖而出？你的行为是符合你的宗教的期望，还是在某种程度上是非正统的？参考教团声誉表，以确定你被你的大宗教机构如何看待。",
	"{@b Faithful Few}. You are seen as righteous crusaders, upholding the highest ideals of your faith and doing the gods' work in the world. Your deeds and methods are rarely, if ever, questioned.": "{@b Faithful Few}. 你们被视为正义的十字军，坚持你们信仰的最高理想，在这个世界上做神的工作。你们的行为和方法很少受到质疑，如果有的话。",
	"{@b Respectable}. Your behavior and beliefs are in line with the hierarchy's expectations. As long as you stay in line, no one gives you trouble.": "{@b Respectable}. 你的行为和信仰与等级制度的期望一致。只要你保持一致，没有人给你带来麻烦。",
	"{@b Troublemakers}. You attract unwanted attention to your order or hierarchy from outside, so you are under a great deal of pressure to keep a low profile.": "{@b Troublemakers}. 你吸引了外界对你的秩序或等级制度的不必要的注意，所以你有很大的压力要保持低调。",
	"{@b Rebels}. You flout the dictates of your hierarchy—even if it's for just reasons. Your superiors constantly try to rein you in.": "{@b Rebels}. 你藐视上级的指令--即使是出于正义的原因。你的上级不断试图控制你。",
	"{@b Reformers}. You bring a much-needed breath of fresh air into the ranks of your faith. If only more people of faith would act as you do!": "{@b Reformers}. 你为你的信仰队伍带来了非常需要的新鲜空气。如果有更多有信仰的人像你这样做就好了!",
	"{@b Anathema}. For right or wrong, your behavior and beliefs are viewed as unacceptable, and the hierarchy of your faith actively opposes your work.": "{@b Anathema}. 无论对错，你的行为和信仰都被视为不可接受，你的信仰的等级制度积极反对你的工作。",
	"Your primary contact within the religious order is usually some kind of priest—not necessarily a cleric or druid, but someone who holds a priestly office and a position of some authority in the hierarchy of the organization. This person might direct you and your adventures according to their interpretation of divine will, or they might trust the gods to lead you to do what needs to be done. Of course, some priests (as well as lay functionaries) are more interested in their own agendas than any supposed divine will. Consult the Order Contact table to determine your liaison within the religious order.": "你在宗教团体中的主要联系人通常是某种牧师--不一定是牧师或德鲁伊，而是在该组织的等级制度中担任牧师职务和某种权威地位的人。这个人可能会根据他们对神意的解释来指导你和你的冒险，或者他们可能相信神明会带领你去做需要做的事情。当然，有些牧师（以及非专业的职能人员）对他们自己的议程更感兴趣，而不是任何所谓的神的意志。请参考教团联系表，确定你在教团内的联络人。",
	"A cloistered priest with little worldly experience who doesn't really understand what you do but seems to approve of it anyway": "一个没有什么世俗经验的隐居牧师，他并不真正理解你的工作，但似乎还是赞同你的工作。",
	"A cynical priest who thinks nothing you do makes any difference in the grand scheme of things": "一个愤世嫉俗的牧师，认为你所做的一切在大计划中都没有任何区别",

	"A pious priest who sees the hands of the divine in every event, even the actions of unbelievers": "一个虔诚的牧师，在每一个事件中都能看到神圣的手，甚至是不信者的行为。",
	"A devout lay person who envies the magic and power your group wields": "一个虔诚的普通人，羡慕你们团体所拥有的魔法和力量",
	"A practical functionary who tries to keep your work isolated from the knowledge and influence of the priests": "试图使你的工作与牧师的知识和影响隔绝的实际职能人员",
	"In addition to the Templars of the Silver Flame, several other groups might sponsor your party, such as the following organizations:": "除了银色火焰的圣殿骑士，还有其他几个团体可能会赞助你的聚会，例如以下组织。",
	"{@b The Deathguard}. This elite order of elven priests and warriors from Aerenal is sworn to destroy all evil undead.": "{@b The Deathguard}. 这个由来自Aerenal的精灵祭司和战士组成的精英组织发誓要消灭所有邪恶的亡灵。",
	"{@b The Devout of the Celestial Crown.} One of many liturgical councils that serve a mostly administrative role for the priests of the Sovereign Host, the Devout manage a large portion of the city of Sharn.": "{@b The Devout of the Celestial Crown.}众多礼仪委员会之一，主要为圣主的祭司们提供行政服务，虔诚会管理着沙恩城的大部分地区。",
	"{@b The Gatekeepers}. This ancient druid sect seeks to defend nature against aberrations, fiends, and undead.": "{@b The Gatekeepers}. 这个古老的德鲁伊教派旨在保护自然界免受反常者、恶魔和亡灵的侵害。",
	"An institution of higher education sponsors your group. You might be researchers, bodyguards for scholars, or glorified treasure hunters searching for ancient artifacts. The university might regularly employ you or you might have a contact at the university who pays you any time you bring back something useful from your adventures. You could be a team of academics, or you could be employed to provide some (physical and magical) muscle that the university otherwise lacks.": "一个高等教育机构赞助你们的团体。你们可能是研究人员、学者的保镖，或者是寻找古代文物的光荣的寻宝者。大学可能会定期雇用你们，或者你们在大学里有一个联系人，当你们从冒险中带回来有用的东西时，他就会付钱给你们。你可能是一个学术团队，或者你可能被雇用来提供一些（物理和魔法）肌肉，否则大学就会缺乏。",
	"At the heart of Sharn's Morgrave University is a sharp dichotomy: On the one hand, it is known as a nexus for scholars wishing to study Xen'drik, thanks in large part to Sharn's proximity to the secret continent. Its collections of artifacts and scholarly works about ancient Xen'drik and the Dhakaan Empire are unparalleled. In many ways, it lives up to the shining vision of its founder, Lord Lareth ir'Morgrave, to be \"a beacon of knowledge shining from the tallest towers of the city.\"": "沙恩的莫格莱夫大学的核心是一个尖锐的二元对立。一方面，它被称为希望研究Xen'drik的学者们的纽带，这在很大程度上要归功于沙恩靠近这个秘密大陆。它所收藏的关于古代Xen'drik和达卡帝国的文物和学术著作是无与伦比的。在许多方面，它没有辜负其创始人拉雷斯-伊尔-莫格莱夫勋爵的光辉愿景，即成为 \"一座从城市最高的塔楼上照亮的知识明灯\"。",
	"On the other hand, the university's reputation is tainted by allegations of smuggling, treasure hunting, and profiteering. Many priceless relics recovered from Xen'drik or Dhakaani ruins have disappeared from the university vaults and found their way to the black market or into the hands of the Aurum. It's an open secret that some scholars, professors, and even students at the university have ties to smugglers and thieves. All these allegations, too, have ties to the university's founding: Lord Morgrave himself is said to have made his fortune selling Dhakaani artifacts on the black market, and some have claimed that the true purpose of the university was to help him build his fortune through such questionable means.": "另一方面，该大学的声誉也因走私、寻宝和牟取暴利的指控而受到损害。许多从Xen'drik或Dhakaani遗迹中找到的无价文物都从大学的金库中消失了，并被发现进入黑市或落入Aurum的手中。大学的一些学者、教授、甚至学生与走私者和盗贼有联系，这是一个公开的秘密。所有这些指控，也都与该大学的创立有关系。据说莫格莱夫勋爵本人就是通过在黑市上出售达卡尼文物而发家的，有些人声称大学的真正目的是帮助他通过这种可疑的手段建立财富。",
	"The academic world is relatively small, and people at any one university tend to have connections at others. You might parlay such relationships into assistance from academies and institutions, such as the following organizations:": "学术界相对较小，任何一所大学的人往往在其他大学有关系。你可以将这种关系转化为来自学院和机构的援助，如以下组织。",
	"{@b Flamewind}. The sphinx Flamewind (described in the \"Immortal Being\" section) isn't officially affiliated with the university, but she lives there and spends much of her time in its libraries and museums. As a scholar of the Draconic Prophecy, Flamewind often poses strange questions and sends adventurers on obscure missions.": "{@b Flamewind}. 狮身人面兽Flamewind（在 \"不朽的存在 \"一节中描述过）并不正式隶属于这所大学，但她住在那里，大部分时间都在图书馆和博物馆中度过。作为一个研究龙族预言的学者，焰风经常提出一些奇怪的问题，并派冒险者执行一些晦涩难懂的任务。",
	"{@b Library of Korranberg}. The Library of Korranberg boasts the greatest collection of learning in Khorvaire. Its prestige means that people associated with it often look down on their colleagues at Morgrave University, but they still celebrate the two institutions' common purpose of pursuing knowledge. If Morgrave's own libraries are insufficient for the task at hand, your group can probably find help in Korranberg.": "{@b Library of Korranberg}. 科兰伯格图书馆拥有霍尔韦尔最伟大的学问收藏。它的声望意味着与它有关的人经常看不起莫格莱夫大学的同事，但他们仍然赞美这两个机构追求知识的共同目的。如果莫格莱夫自己的图书馆不足以完成手头的任务，你的小组可能会在科兰伯格找到帮助。",
	"{@b The Twelve}. For many scholars of magical studies, the idea of pursuing their research under the auspices of the Twelve is a cherished dream. Some faculty members at Morgrave have had the opportunity to do just that, and many others have nurtured connections to the Twelve in an attempt to secure that honor. Those connections can give your group access to powerful magic and the other resources of the Twelve.": "{@b The Twelve}. 对于许多研究魔法的学者来说，在十二门派的主持下进行研究的想法是一个珍贵的梦想。莫格莱夫的一些教职员工已经有机会做到这一点，还有许多人已经培养了与十二门派的联系，试图确保这一荣誉。这些关系可以让你的团体获得强大的魔法和十二神殿的其他资源。",
	"{@b Wayfinder Foundation}. Morgrave maintains extensive connections with the Wayfinder Foundation—an exclusive guild for adventurers, which funds expeditions to distant locales. Should your group needs a grant or resources from the Wayfinders, a letter of recommendation from someone at Morgrave carries some weight.": "{@b Wayfinder Foundation}. 莫格莱夫与探路者基金会保持着广泛的联系--这是一个专门为冒险家服务的行会，它为远方的探险活动提供资金。如果你的团队需要探路者基金会的资助或资源，莫格莱夫的推荐信会有一定分量。",
	"Morgrave University has few true enemies but many rivals. Despite the friendly ties among academic institutions, Morgrave occupies the low end of the prestige scale among academic bodies, so its faculty tends to look for opportunities to steal glory from its academic peers. Beyond rivalries with allied organizations, Morgrave openly competes with the following group:": "莫格莱夫大学真正的敌人很少，但对手却很多。尽管学术机构之间有着友好的联系，但莫格莱夫在学术机构中占据着低端的声望，因此其教师往往会寻找机会从学术同行那里窃取荣耀。除了与联盟组织的竞争外，莫格莱夫还与以下团体公开竞争。",
	"{@b University of Wynarn}. Foremost among Morgrave's rivals is Aundair's University of Wynarn, whose administrators have been known to refer to Morgrave as an \"institute of learning, relic hunting, and grave robbing.\" The University of Wynarn is ancient—the first university established in the Five Nations—and more prestigious than Morgrave. It sponsors many of the same kind of expeditions and can boast many great discoveries, yet, somehow, Morgrave is more famous, and that stings many among the university's staff.": "{@b University of Wynarn}. 在莫格莱夫的竞争对手中，最重要的是昂代尔的威纳恩大学，其管理者曾将莫格莱夫称为 \"学习、遗迹狩猎和盗墓的学院\"。威纳恩大学是一所古老的大学，是五国中成立的第一所大学，比摩格莱夫更有声望。它赞助了许多同类型的探险活动，并可以夸耀许多伟大的发现，然而，不知何故，莫格莱夫更有名，这让大学的许多员工感到震惊。",
	"With a university as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "如果有一所大学作为你的团体的赞助人，你将获得以下好处。",
	"{@b Compensation}. The university pays for the work you do on its behalf. The nature of your employment influences how you are paid. On average, the university pays each member of your group 1 gp per day, or enough to sustain a modest lifestyle. Or you might be paid a bounty for each ancient artifact you bring back from your adventures and give to the university.": "{@b Compensation}. 大学为你代表它所做的工作付费。你的工作性质影响着你的报酬方式。平均来说，大学每天付给你们每个人1戈比，或者足够维持一个小规模的生活。或者，你从冒险中带回的每件古代文物都会得到一笔赏金，并交给大学。",
	"{@b Documentation}. Each member of your group has identification papers that include your affiliation with the university, which carries some clout in academic circles. The university also secures documentation, letters of introduction, and traveling papers for you if your work requires them. Finally, if your adventures take you to Xen'drik, the university secures the necessary letters of marque issued by the king of Breland, which grant you permission to explore the ruins there.": "{@b Documentation}. 你们小组的每个成员都有身份证明文件，其中包括你们与大学的关系，这在学术界具有一定的影响力。如果你的工作需要，大学还可以为你提供文件、介绍信和旅行证件。最后，如果你的冒险活动带你到Xen'drik，大学会确保由Breland国王签发的必要授权书，这些授权书允许你探索那里的遗迹。",
	"{@b Resources}. Most universities have extensive libraries and museums, which you have access to. You can call in a favor to gain access to resources that are generally not on exhibit—dangerous relics or possibly magic items, spellbooks, and the like. Additionally, the faculty of your university might make it possible for you to consult with experts in various fields—so long as you can coax them away from their work.": "{@b Resources}. 大多数大学都有广泛的图书馆和博物馆，你可以进入这些地方。你可以找人帮忙，以获得一般不展出的资源--危险的遗物或可能的魔法物品、法术书，以及类似物品。此外，你大学的教师可能会让你向各个领域的专家咨询--只要你能把他们从工作中哄走。",
	"{@b Training}. Because you're associated with the university, you receive a discount on any education you wish to pursue. When you undergo training as a downtime activity (as described in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} or {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}), you pay only one-half the normal cost, assuming that what you are studying is something the university teaches. Training in languages, musical instruments, and other tools might also be available, at the DM's discretion. In addition, you can gain proficiency in the {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, {@skill Nature}, or {@skill Religion} skills by this method, as if you were learning a language. A character can only learn one of these skills in this way.": "{@b Training}. 因为你与大学有联系，你在任何你想接受的教育上都能得到折扣。当你作为停工活动接受培训时（如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}或{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}所述），你只需支付正常费用的二分之一，假设你所学的是大学所教的东西。语言、乐器和其他工具的训练也可能会有，由DM决定。此外，你可以通过这种方法获得{@skill Arcana}、{@skill History}、{@skill Nature}或{@skill Religion}技能的熟练度，就像你在学习一门语言一样。一个角色只能用这种方法学习其中一个技能。",
	"A group sponsored by a university might look very much like any other adventuring party, with a range of diverse skills and capabilities. The only significant distinction lies between characters who are scholars and those who are more traditional adventurers. Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:": "一个由大学赞助的团体可能看起来很像其他的冒险队伍，拥有一系列不同的技能和能力。唯一重要的区别在于学者角色和传统的冒险家角色之间。考虑为你的队伍中的角色设置一些或所有这些角色。",
	"{@b Field Researcher}. The academic in your group might also be a character with plenty of training and experience in the dangerous life of an adventurer. Sometimes called tomb raiders or grave robbers, such characters know that groundbreaking work requires firsthand experience with the creatures, cultures, forces, and histories being investigated, and the best way to get that is in the field. This role is similar to the Scholar, but the Field Researcher is armed with combat-oriented spells that supplement the knowledge-focused capabilities of the Scholar, preparing them to face those who guard the world's greatest secrets.": "{@b Field Researcher}. 你的小组中的学者也可能是一个在冒险家的危险生活中受过大量训练和有经验的角色。有时被称为盗墓者或盗墓者，这类角色知道，开创性的工作需要对被调查的生物、文化、力量和历史有第一手的经验，而获得这种经验的最好方式就是在野外。这个角色与学者类似，但实地研究者拥有战斗导向的法术，以补充学者以知识为中心的能力，使他们准备好面对那些守护世界最伟大秘密的人。",
	"{@b Research Assistant}. Whether their seeking to graduate, get published, or make their academic mark, the Research Assistant's fate is likely tied up in the success of another scholar or a specific project. Alternatively, the Research Assistant might just be along for the ride, helping a professor merely to pass a course. Regardless, such characters might come from any class or background and could have skills gathered from experiences far outside the academic sphere. While there are certainly legitimate Research Assistants who honestly pursue their studies, this role might suit characters without academic interests.": "{@b Research Assistant}. 无论他们是想毕业，还是想发表文章，或是想在学术上有所建树，研究助理的命运很可能与另一位学者或某个特定项目的成功联系在一起。另外，研究助理也可能只是顺水推舟，只是为了帮助教授通过一门课程。无论如何，这样的人物可能来自任何阶层或背景，并可能拥有从学术领域以外的经验中收集的技能。当然也有合法的研究助理，他们真诚地追求他们的研究，这个角色可能适合没有学术兴趣的人物。",
	"{@b Scholar}. Likely possessing a high Intelligence score and a focus on learning and research, the Scholar in your party might represent the academic emphasis of the university. This character is often a noncombatant, a professor or student the rest of the party protects. Alternatively, they might live a dual life, shedding their academic persona as soon as they're off campus grounds. The Scholar might also be a nonplayer character, or the role could be filled by a player character whose spells and training don't include combat. A wizard whose spellbook is filled with utility-focused spells makes a fine Scholar, as might some clerics and monks. In any case, the sage background is an obvious choice for the Scholar, with acolyte and hermit also providing fine alternatives. Proficiency in skills such as {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, {@skill Investigation}, {@skill Nature}, and {@skill Religion} often proves useful for this character.": "{@b Scholar}. 学者可能拥有较高的智力分数，并专注于学习和研究，你的队伍中的学者可能代表大学的学术重点。这个角色通常是一个非战斗人员，是一个教授或学生，受到其他成员的保护。另外，他们也可能过着双重生活，一旦离开校园，就摆脱了他们的学术身份。学者也可以是一个非玩家角色，或者由一个其法术和训练不包括战斗的玩家角色来扮演这个角色。巫师的法术书中充满了以实用为重点的法术，就像一些牧师和僧侣一样，可以成为一个好的学者。在任何情况下，圣人背景都是学者的明显选择，圣徒和隐士也提供了不错的选择。熟练掌握{@skill Arcana}、{@skill History}、{@skill Investigation}、{@skill Nature}和{@skill Religion}等技能通常对这个角色很有用。",
	"Decide as a group, in consultation with your DM, what kind of work your group does for the university. Consult the Scholarly Missions table to determine what sort of adventures you undertake.": "以小组为单位，与你的管理员协商，决定你的小组为大学做什么样的工作。请参考学术任务表，以确定你们进行什么样的冒险。",

	"{@b Exploration}. Khorvaire is a vast continent, and areas beyond the heartland of the Five Nations are poorly charted. Your focus is on understanding the wilder places of the world, as well as distant cultures.": "{@b Exploration}. Khorvaire是一个广阔的大陆，而五国中心地带以外的地区则没有什么地图。你的重点是了解世界上比较荒凉的地方，以及遥远的文化。",

	"{@b Respected}. Your work is considered noteworthy, though not revolutionary. Scholars in your field follow your writing and efforts with interest.": "{@b Respected}. 你的工作被认为是值得注意的，虽然不是革命性的。你所在领域的学者饶有兴趣地关注你的写作和努力。",
	"{@b Anonymous}. Try as you might, you can't earn positive or negative attention. Even worse, after you've published your findings, more prominent scholars have made similar statements to much acclaim.": "{@b Anonymous}. 无论你怎么努力，你都无法赢得正面或负面的关注。更糟糕的是，在你发表了你的发现之后，更多的知名学者也发表了类似的声明，获得了很多赞誉。",

	"With a university as your patron, you are part of a sprawling bureaucracy—maybe deep in the tangles of it or, more likely, lingering at the edges. Wherever you sit in the network of colleges, administrators, and faculty, a single person serves as your primary point of contact, someone who has a significant impact on the nature of your relationship with the university. Reference the University Contact table to help determine who manages the relationship between you and the university.": "以大学为靠山，你是一个庞大的官僚机构的一部分--也许是深陷其中，或者更有可能是在边缘徘徊。无论你在学院、行政人员和教师的网络中处于什么位置，都有一个人作为你的主要联系人，这个人对你与大学关系的性质有重大影响。参考大学联系表以帮助确定谁管理你和大学之间的关系。",

No members of the Brelish royal family were in attendance during the attack.": "尽管冬宫在一个世纪的战争中没有受到任何影响，但却遭受了来自一个意想不到的地方的攻击：布雷兰的人民。所谓的 \"自由之剑 \"在一次大胆的突袭中立下汗马功劳，使宫殿的东翼陷入火海。在这次袭击中，没有布莱里什王室成员在场。",
	"The Swords of Liberty call for the violent overthrow of the Wynarn monarchy, demanding that all power be invested in the Brelish parliament. Their manifesto draws on the speeches of Lord Ruken ir'Clarn, but Lord Ruken has condemned their action. \"No victory is possible when Brelish fight Brelish,\" he said in Wroat. \"But I hope King Boranel can see that the time for change is upon us and help us navigate a peaceful transition of power before any more innocents are hurt.\"": "自由之剑号召用暴力推翻威纳恩君主制，要求将所有权力交给布雷利什议会。他们的宣言借鉴了鲁肯（Ruken ir'Clarn）勋爵的演讲，但鲁肯勋爵谴责了他们的行动。\"他在Wroat说：\"当布莱里什人与布莱里什人战斗时，不可能有胜利。\"但我希望博拉内尔国王能看到变革的时刻已经到来，并在更多的无辜者受到伤害之前帮助我们引导权力的和平过渡。\"",
	"For Breland, the Last War was an ever-shifting tangle of enemies and alliances. Breland fought Aundair, Cyre, Karrnath, and Thrane at various points of the war, as well as clashing with Darguun and Droaam. These conflicts caused many Brelish to embrace a cynical view of the world, a sense that no one can be fully trusted and that people need to look out for themselves. As a Brelish character, you could have an axe to grind against any of the other nations. This is balanced against a strong belief in humanoid rights and dignity, convictions that motivated the Brelish to shelter more Cyran refugees than any other nation.": "对于布雷兰来说，最后的战争是一场不断变化的敌人和联盟的纠缠。布雷兰在战争的不同阶段与昂代尔（Aundair）、赛尔（Cyre）、卡尔纳特（Karrnath）和瑟兰（Thrane）作战，并与达尔古恩（Darguun）和德罗安（Droaam）发生冲突。这些冲突导致许多布雷利什人对世界抱有一种愤世嫉俗的看法，认为没有人可以被完全信任，人们需要为自己着想。作为一个布雷利什人的角色，你可能会对其他任何一个国家有不满的想法。这与对人的权利和尊严的强烈信念相平衡，这种信念促使布雷利什人比其他任何国家都更多地收容赛伦难民。",
	"The major cities of Breland host significant populations of refugees, both Cyrans and Brelish from villages lost in the war. This has increased the overall level of poverty and desperation and contributed to an increase in crime. The southern cities—including Wroat and Sharn—suffered relatively little damage in the war, but northern Breland was hard hit. The city of Vathirond is still repairing the damage from Thrane attacks, and many northern villages are either recovering or have simply been abandoned.": "布雷兰的主要城市收容了大量的难民，包括来自战争中失去的村庄的锡兰人和布雷利什人。这增加了整体的贫困和绝望程度，并导致了犯罪的增加。南部城市--包括沃洛特和沙恩--在战争中受到的损害相对较小，但布雷兰北部受到了严重打击。瓦西隆德（Vathirond）市仍在修复瑟恩（Thrane）攻击造成的损失，许多北部村庄要么正在恢复，要么干脆被遗弃。",
	"Despite these struggles, the Brelish maintain a positive view of their future. The heart of Breland is as strong as it ever was, and the citizens believe that had the war continued, Breland would have triumphed.": "尽管有这些挣扎，布雷里什人对他们的未来保持着积极的看法。布雷利什的心脏和以前一样强大，市民们相信，如果战争继续下去，布雷利什会取得胜利。",
	"Destroyed at the end of the Last War, Cyre now exists only in the hearts of the refugees scattered across Khorvaire.": "赛尔在最后一次战争结束时被摧毁，现在只存在于散落在Khorvaire各地的难民心中。",
	"Before the war, Cyre was the seat of the kings and queens of Galifar. The wealth of the kingdom flowed through Cyre, and it was a nexus for commerce and culture. By tradition, Cyre's Princess Mishann had the rightful claim to the throne of Galifar. Cyrans take pride that they alone were in the right in the Last War, but they unquestionably lost more to the war than any other nation. As a Cyran, you stand on the moral high ground, but that may offer little comfort.": "在战争之前，赛尔是加利法尔的国王和女王的所在地。王国的财富流经赛尔，它是商业和文化的纽带。根据传统，赛尔的公主米珊对加利法尔的王位有合法的要求。赛尔人感到自豪的是，他们在最后的战争中是唯一正确的，但毫无疑问，他们在战争中的损失比任何其他国家都大。作为一个赛伦人，你站在道德的制高点上，但这可能不会带来什么安慰。",
	"Cyrans like to say that their culture represented the best that Galifar had to offer, which is to say a little bit of everything. Cyrans value diversity and versatility, both in talents and thought. Cyre couldn't match Karrnath in martial discipline or Aundair in the arcane arts, but the flexibility of its forces reflected the nation's ideals.": "锡兰人喜欢说，他们的文化代表了加利法尔所能提供的最好的东西，也就是说，什么都有一点儿。赛尔人重视多样性和多面性，无论是人才还是思想。赛尔在武术纪律方面无法与卡尔纳特相提并论，在奥术方面也无法与昂代尔相提并论，但其部队的灵活性反映了这个国家的理想。",
	"Although the Sovereign Host was the dominant faith of Cyre, the Silver Flame had a significant following. Many survivors question their faith in the wake of the Mourning, but some believe that their anguish at the loss of their homeland is a divine trial, prompting them to cling to their faith more than ever.": "虽然主宰者是赛尔的主导信仰，但银色火焰也有大量的追随者。许多幸存者在哀悼之后质疑他们的信仰，但有些人认为，他们对失去家园的痛苦是一种神圣的考验，促使他们比以往任何时候都更加坚持自己的信仰。",
	"Queen Dannel ir'Wynarn was in Metrol on the Day of Mourning and is presumed dead. Her son, Prince Oargev ir'Wynarn, holds court in New Cyre, a massive refugee camp set up in Breland. Some refugees support Oargev and the dream of a restored Cyre, while others prefer to focus on the future instead of trying to reclaim the past. As a Cyran, you should decide whether you hold tight to your national identity, or instead consider yourself to be an expatriate without a nation.": "达内尔-伊尔-维纳恩女王在哀悼日当天在梅特罗尔，被认为已经死亡。她的儿子Oargev ir'Wynarn王子在新赛尔城开庭，这是一个在布雷兰建立的大规模难民营。一些难民支持Oargev和恢复赛尔城的梦想，而另一些难民则更愿意关注未来，而不是试图追回过去。作为一个赛尔人，你应该决定你是紧紧抓住你的民族身份，还是认为自己是一个没有国家的侨民。",
	"Cyre was the ancestral seat of the dragonmarked House Cannith, the house of Making. The house maintained arcane workshops across Cyre. Who knows what treasures wait in Cannith vaults for those who brave the dangers of the Mournland?": "赛尔城是有龙纹的坎尼斯家族的祖先所在地，也就是制造之家。该家族在整个赛尔城保持着神秘的工场。谁知道坎尼斯的金库里有什么宝藏在等待着那些勇敢面对哀牢地危险的人呢？",
	"When creating a character from Cyre, consider the following questions:": "在创建赛尔的角色时，考虑以下问题。",
	"{@b What Have You Lost?} Did you lose wealth or status? Did you have family or loved ones killed in the Mourning? Did you lose something you could one day recover from the Mournland—arcane research, an heirloom artifact, or a precious family relic? Consider the impact the disaster has on your background. As a Cyran noble or soldier, your estates have been lost and your army scattered, but you still have the respect of your comrades or peers.": "{@b What Have You Lost?} 你是否失去财富或地位？你是否有家人或亲人在丧礼中丧生？你是否失去了一些你有朝一日可以从哀乐中恢复的东西--甘蔗研究、传家宝文物或珍贵的家族遗物？考虑这场灾难对你的背景的影响。作为一个锡兰族的贵族或士兵，你的财产已经丢失，你的军队也被打散了，但你仍然得到了你的战友或同行的尊重。",
	"{@b What Do You Hold Onto?} Do you have a trinket that embodies Cyre for you? Is your wand or weapon an heirloom of your family? As an entertainer or guild artisan, do you preserve a particular Cyran tradition?": "{@b What Do You Hold Onto?} 你是否有一个体现赛尔的饰品？你的魔杖或武器是你家族的传家之宝吗？作为一个艺人或行会工匠，你是否保留了一个特殊的赛尔族传统？",
	"{@b What Drives You}? Are you determined to solve the mystery of the Mourning? Do you want to help other refugees, or are you concerned only with your personal survival? Is there something you want to recover from the Mournland, or would you prefer to never set foot in Cyre again? Do you hold a grudge against the nations that fought against Cyre in the war, or are you solely concerned with the future?": "{@b What Drives You}? 你是否下定决心要解开 \"悼念 \"之谜？你是想帮助其他难民，还是只关心你个人的生存？有什么东西是你想从哀伤之地恢复的，还是你希望永远不要再踏入赛尔城？你对那些在战争中与赛尔作战的国家心存怨恨，还是只关心未来？",
	"Cyre was devastated by the Mourning. Its ruins have become grim reminders of the folly of war. Unknown threats both magical and monstrous haunt the Mournland. For more about the Mournland as it stands now, see {@book chapter 4|ERLW|5|Cyre (The Mournland)}.": "赛尔城被哀伤所摧毁。它的废墟已经成为战争愚蠢的严峻提醒。魔法和怪兽的未知威胁困扰着哀牢地。更多关于现在的哀伤之地的信息，请参见{@book chapter 4|ERLW|5|Cyre (The Mournland)}。",
	"Once the seat of House Cannith, this was a place of wonders—a city where \"magic comes to life.\" Marvels of the city included the Clockwork Menagerie, showcasing the golems and homunculi made by generations of artificers; production facilities that housed three creation forges (see {@book chapter 5|ERLW|12}), and the miraculous Steel Gardens, an early breakthrough that paved the way for the living warforged. If you're an artificer or have ties to House Cannith, you might have roots in Eston.": "这里曾经是坎尼斯家族的所在地，是一个充满奇迹的地方--一个 \"魔法生活化 \"的城市。这座城市的奇迹包括发条动物园，展示了几代工匠制作的巨兽和同形体；生产设施中包含了三个创世锻造厂（见{@book chapter 5|ERLW|12}），以及神奇的钢铁花园，这是一个早期的突破，为活体战锻人铺平了道路。如果你是一个工匠或者与坎尼斯家族有联系，你可能在埃斯顿有根。",
	"Once the capital of Galifar, Metrol was known as the Rising City, for many of its buildings stood atop soaring columns of rock that dared to scrape the heavens. The Cathedral of the Sovereign Host was the center for followers of that faith. The Vault served as the mint and treasury of Galifar, containing cultural treasures deemed too valuable to be displayed; salvagers dream of finding this \"golden palace.\" Floating gardens orbited the towering Royal Vermishard. Now lost, the beauty of Metrol lives only in Cyran memory.": "梅特罗尔曾经是加利法尔的首都，被称为 \"崛起之城\"，因为它的许多建筑都矗立在高耸入云的岩柱之上，敢于刮起天际。主教大教堂是该信仰的追随者的中心。金库是加利法尔的铸币厂和国库，里面有被认为太过珍贵而无法展示的文化珍品；打捞者梦想着找到这座 \"黄金宫殿\"。漂浮的花园围绕着高耸的皇家维米沙德。现在，梅特罗尔的美丽已经消失了，它只存在于赛伦的记忆中。",
	"A coastal town in southern Cyre, Seaside was a popular vacation spot even during the war. While not as celebrated a destination as Stormhome in Aundair, the memory of Seaside has become an iconic image of peace and tranquility for the people of Cyre.": "海滨是赛尔南部的一个沿海城镇，即使在战争期间也是一个受欢迎的度假胜地。虽然不像昂代尔的风暴之家那样是一个著名的目的地，但在赛尔人民的记忆中，海滨镇已经成为和平与安宁的标志性形象。",
	"No nation won the Last War, but Cyre unquestionably lost it. Other nations are recovering from the conflict, but Cyre is gone. The lands not destroyed in the Mourning were lost decades earlier to Darguun and Valenar. Cyrans who survived the war must now carve out a new destiny in the lands of their enemies or in foreign nations beyond what was once the Kingdom of Galifar.": "没有国家赢得了最后的战争，但赛尔毫无疑问地失去了它。其他国家正在从冲突中恢复过来，但赛尔已经消失了。在哀悼中没有被摧毁的土地早在几十年前就被达尔古恩和瓦勒纳夺走了。在战争中幸存下来的赛尔人现在必须在敌人的土地上或在曾经的加利法尔王国之外的外国开辟新的命运。",
	"In creating a Cyran character, first determine how you survived the Mourning. Were you outside Cyre when it occurred, or did you somehow escape the destruction? Where did you take shelter? Breland has taken in refugees and created refugee camps. Thrane also accepted refugees but has worked to disperse and integrate them into the general population. Are you grateful or bitter? Do you have family or friends in refugee camps, or are you a lone survivor? Other Cyrans sought opportunities on the frontiers, settling in the jungles of Q'barra or seeking a new life in the distant land of Xen'drik.": "在创建赛尔号角色时，首先要确定你是如何在哀悼中幸存下来的。丧礼发生时你是否在赛尔城外，或者你是否以某种方式逃离了毁灭？你在哪里避难？布雷兰接纳了难民并建立了难民营。瑟兰也接受了难民，但一直在努力将他们分散并融入普通民众中。你是感激还是怨恨？你在难民营有家人或朋友吗，还是你是一个孤独的幸存者？其他锡兰人在边疆寻找机会，在Q'barra的丛林中定居，或在遥远的Xen'drik土地上寻求新生活。",
	"Many Cyran survivors are soldiers, veterans stationed on the front lines when the Mourning occurred. If multiple members of your party are Cyrans, you might have served together during the Last War. Because Cyrans are so widely dispersed, you can encounter former comrades or friends anywhere in Khorvaire.": "许多赛伦人的幸存者都是士兵，在哀悼发生时驻扎在前线的老兵。如果你的队伍中有多个成员是赛伦人，那么你们可能在最后的战争中一起服役。由于赛伦人的分布非常广泛，你可以在霍尔韦尔的任何地方遇到以前的战友或朋友。",
	"Since Cyrans lost their lands, the distinctions between peasant and aristocrat have become moot. Even with a criminal background, you might have been a viscount in Cyre; your background reflects your current standing and the resources you can call upon in the present.": "自从赛尔人失去了他们的土地，农民和贵族之间的区别已经变得毫无意义。即使有犯罪背景，你在赛尔也可能是个子爵；你的背景反映了你现在的地位和你现在可以调用的资源。",
	"Goblins and their kin have always been part of Khorvaire. Their ancient empire spread across the lands now held by other nations, and goblin foundations still stand underneath many human cities. This empire collapsed into savagery, and when humans arrived from Sarlona, they drove the goblins from their ancestral lands. Thus, goblins have long been a disenfranchised people, living in the shadows of newer nations or in wild lands shunned by humans.": "妖精和他们的亲属一直都是霍尔韦尔的一部分。他们古老的帝国遍布了现在被其他国家占据的土地，而地精的地基仍然矗立在许多人类城市的地下。这个帝国在野蛮中崩溃了，当人类从萨洛纳来到这里时，他们把地精从他们的祖先的土地上赶走了。因此，地精长期以来一直是一个被剥夺了权利的民族，生活在较新的国家的阴影下，或者生活在被人类回避的荒野之地。",
	"The land now called Darguun was once part of Cyre. The hobgoblin clans known as the Ghaal'dar were based in the Seawall Mountains, but during the war, the demand for mercenaries drew an ever-increasing number of goblins out of the mountains to fight for Cyre and Breland. Late in the war, a brilliant hobgoblin named Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat'kor recognized that the goblins had become the dominant military power in the region. Uniting the Ghaal'dar under his banner, Haruuc seized the territory he was supposed to protect. The Five Nations were unprepared, and Breland quickly negotiated an alliance with Haruuc to secure the border. Cyre fought the goblins until the Day of Mourning, but the majority of delegates involved in forging the Treaty of Thronehold chose to recognize the new nation of Darguun to ensure peace.": "现在被称为达尔古恩的土地曾经是赛尔的一部分。被称为Ghaal'dar的妖精部族以海堤山脉为基地，但在战争期间，对雇佣兵的需求吸引了越来越多的妖精走出山脉，为赛尔和布雷兰德作战。在战争后期，一个名叫Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat'kor的杰出妖精认识到，妖精已经成为该地区的主导军事力量。哈鲁克将盖尔达尔人团结在他的旗帜下，夺取了他本应保护的领土。五国毫无准备，布雷兰德很快就与哈鲁克谈判结盟，以确保边境安全。赛尔与地精作战，直到哀悼日，但参与缔结《王座条约》的大多数代表选择承认新国家达尔古恩以确保和平。",
	"Darguun is a young and volatile nation, ruled by Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat'kor. Haruuc remains a brilliant strategist and tactician, but many wonder whether he can maintain the web of alliances that hold the Ghaal'dar together, and whether he and his people will be content to abide by the terms of the treaty. Other goblins still hidden in the mountains—the enigmatic Heirs of Dhakaan (see {@book chapter 4|ERLW|9|Goblinoids (Heirs of Dhakaan)})—could pose a threat both to the goblins and the rest of Khorvaire.": "达尔古恩是一个年轻而不稳定的国家，由莱什-哈鲁克-沙拉特科尔统治。哈鲁克仍然是一位出色的战略家和战术家，但许多人怀疑他是否能维持维系加勒达尔的联盟网络，以及他和他的人民是否会满足于遵守条约的条款。其他仍然隐藏在山区的地精--神秘的达卡安的继承人（见{@book chapter 4|ERLW|9|Goblinoids (Heirs of Dhakaan)}）--可能会对地精和霍尔韦尔的其他地方构成威胁。",
	"Traditionally, the Ghaal'dar worshiped a form of the Dark Six. House Deneith introduced the Sovereign Host to the region, and some goblins have embraced this faith, especially the gods Dol Dorn, Dol Arrah, and Balinor.": "传统上，盖尔达尔人崇拜一种黑暗六神的形式。迪尼斯家族将主宰者引入该地区，一些地精也接受了这种信仰，尤其是多尔多恩、多尔亚拉和巴里诺等神。",
	"House Deneith has a strong presence in Darguun. No one will employ goblin armies in the wake of Haruuc's betrayal, but security forces value smaller units of goblinoid mercenaries for their ferocity and skills.": "德尼兹家族在达尔古恩有很强的影响力。在哈鲁克的背叛之后，没有人会雇佣地精军队，但安全部队很看重地精雇佣兵的凶猛和技能的小型单位。",
	"Darguun is a frontier nation. Although recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold, it doesn't abide by the common laws of the treaty nations. Law enforcement is unpredictable, and acts considered criminal in other nations are part of life in Darguun.": "达尔古恩是一个边疆国家。虽然得到《王权条约》的承认，但它并不遵守条约国家的普通法律。执法是不可预测的，在其他国家被认为是犯罪的行为在达尔古恩是生活的一部分。",
	"A number of bugbear-dominated clans known as the Marguul inhabit southern Darguun. Some of the Marguul refuse to acknowledge the authority of the Ghaal'dar hobgoblins; these clans are especially dangerous and violent.": "一些以虫族为主的部族被称为马尔古尔（Marguul），居住在达尔古恩南部。一些马尔古尔人拒绝承认加尔达尔霍布林的权威；这些部族特别危险和暴力。",
	"Lhesh Haruuc united the Ghaal'dar clans and seized control of Darguun nearly three decades ago. If you are a non-goblin from this land, you may have been born in captivity. Were you forced into bondage, or did you adopt Darguul customs and earn a place in their society?": "Lhesh Haruuc在近三十年前联合了Ghaal'dar部族并夺取了对Darguun的控制权。如果你是来自这片土地的非哥布林，你可能是在囚禁中出生的。你是被迫成为奴隶，还是采用了达尔古尔的习俗并在他们的社会中赢得了一席之地？",
	"Darguun is a logical point of origin for goblin, hobgoblin, or bugbear characters. When creating a Ghaal'dar character from Darguun, consider the following:": "达尔古恩是地精、小妖精或虫熊角色的一个合理的起源点。当从达尔古恩创建一个Ghaal'dar角色时，请考虑以下几点。",
	"{@b Constant Struggle}. Among the Ghaal'dar, you must constantly prove your strength and skill to gain and hold the respect of your kin. Ghaal'dar rarely kill in a casual battle; you might fight to prove a point but kill only when you must.": "{@b Constant Struggle}. 在Ghaal'dar中，你必须不断证明你的力量和技能，以获得并保持你的亲属的尊重。Ghaal'dar很少在随意的战斗中杀人；你可能会为了证明自己的观点而战斗，但只有在必须时才会杀人。",
	"{@b Loyal to Your Clan.} Challenge your peers as you like in times of peace, but when blades unsheathe for war, you stand by your clan—or those allies you have bonded with—until death. This loyalty doesn't extend to warriors of other Ghaal'dar clans.": "{@b Loyal to Your Clan.}在和平时期，你可以随意挑战你的同伴，但当战争中刀剑出鞘时，你会站在你的部族或那些与你有联系的盟友身边，直到死亡。这种忠诚并不延伸到其他Ghaal'dar部族的战士身上。",
	"{@b Muut and Atcha}. Your ancestors once forged an empire even greater than Galifar. Perhaps you believe that your people can reclaim this lost glory. The Dhakaani were renowned for their martial skill and their discipline. {@i Muut} roughly translates to \"duty\"—your duty to your empire, your clan, and your commander. Muut is expected; if you have no muut, you have no place in battle. {@i Atcha} corresponds to \"honor,\" especially your personal honor gained by virtuous deeds that transcend the expectations of muut.": "{@b Muut and Atcha}. 你的祖先曾经建立了一个比加里法尔还要伟大的帝国。也许你相信，你的人民可以夺回这个失去的荣耀。达卡尼人以他们的武艺和纪律而闻名。{@i Muut}粗略地翻译为 \"责任\"--你对你的帝国、你的部族和你的指挥官的责任。穆特是人们所期望的；如果你没有穆特，你在战斗中就没有地位。{@i Atcha}相当于 \"荣誉\"，特别是你的个人荣誉，通过超越 \"穆特 \"期望的美德行为而获得。",
	"Thirty years ago, this region was part of Cyre. The goblins converted towns and villages and raised new settlements, but many ruins and abandoned farms remain. The region is also peppered with dungeons dating back to the ancient goblin empire; these can be found in the vast Torlaac Moor or beneath the Khraal rainforest.": "三十年前，这个地区是赛尔的一部分。妖精们改造了城镇和村庄，建立了新的定居点，但仍有许多废墟和废弃的农场。该地区还遍布可追溯到古代地精帝国的地牢；这些地牢可以在广阔的托拉克荒原或克拉尔雨林下找到。",

It's also a base for the scavengers and salvagers who venture into the Mournland.": "这个设防的村庄靠近哀牢山。它曾经是对抗赛尔的前线。现在，驻扎在这里的地精保护他们的人民免受从扭曲的领域中爬出来的恐怖的影响。如果你是一个地精士兵，你可能曾在戈尔贡角服役。这里也是冒险进入哀牢地的拾荒者和打捞者的基地。",
	"Once a thriving Cyran town, Lyrenton is a ruin on the very edge of the Mournland. It's shunned by the Ghaal'dar, who believe it to be cursed. At night, a terrible wailing that echoes among the ruins can be heard for miles across the plains.": "莱伦顿曾经是一个繁荣的锡兰镇，现在是哀牢地边缘的一片废墟。它被加勒达尔人避开，他们认为它被诅咒了。到了晚上，在废墟中回荡的可怕的哀号声可以在平原上听到数英里。",
	"The largest city in Darguun serves as the seat of Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat'kor. As the hub for trade, travel, and diplomacy, it also a provides a haven for fugitives and smugglers.

	"Any significant settlement is likely the domain of a single Ghaal'dar clan. While these clans give their fealty to Lhesh Haruuc, every clan lord holds absolute power in their town. Some clans are friendly to outsiders and welcome commerce. Others despise non-goblins. Lhesh Haruuc has abolished slavery in Rhukaan Draal, but some of clan lords continue this practice.": "任何重要的定居点都可能是一个Ghaal'dar部族的领地。虽然这些部族对Lhesh Haruuc表示效忠，但每个部族的领主都在他们的城镇拥有绝对权力。有些部族对外来者很友好，欢迎商业。另一些则鄙视非地精。莱什-哈鲁克已经在鲁卡安-德拉尔废除了奴隶制，但有些部族的领主仍在继续这种做法。",
	"Overall, Darguun is a nation that is still finding its identity—a kingdom that seeks to be more than a seized territory. The goblins carry the legacy of a mighty empire and stand in the shadow of the nations around them. Haruuc wants to draw out the best in his people, to harness their strengths and achieve their potential. The rest of Khorvaire waits to see if the Ghaal'dar have the will to remain a nation, and if Darguun can survive when Haruuc passes away.": "总的来说，达尔古恩是一个仍在寻找自己身份的国家--一个寻求超越被占领领土的王国。妖精们带着一个强大帝国的遗产，站在他们周围国家的阴影下。哈鲁克想在他的人民中引出最好的东西，利用他们的力量，发挥他们的潜力。霍尔韦尔的其他地方都在等待，看盖尔达尔人是否有意愿继续成为一个国家，以及在哈鲁克去世后达尔古恩是否能够生存。",

Kaius I had elevated the Blood of Vol in Karrnath and instituted the use of undead as weapons of war. Drago Thul asserted that Kaius III was actually Kaius I, a vampiric monster \"seeking to drain the lifeblood of Karrnath itself.\" This was a serious accusation; the undead have no rights under the Code of Galifar and cannot inherit titles or lands. Thul's challenge spread like wildfire, only to be crushed when Kaius III met the warlords under the midday sun and cut his palm to show his freely flowing blood.": "鉴于凯厄斯三世登基的情况，新国王会面临来自卡尔纳特骄傲的军阀们的挑战，这并不奇怪。一些人质疑他的血统和他的指挥能力。但最不寻常的挑战来自军阀德拉戈-图尔：凯乌斯三世是否真的活着？凯乌斯一世在卡尔纳特提升了沃尔之血的地位，并制定了使用亡灵作为战争武器的规定。德拉戈-图尔断言，凯乌斯三世实际上是凯乌斯一世，一个 \"试图吸干卡尔纳斯本身的生命之血 \"的吸血鬼怪物。这是一个严重的指控；根据《加利法尔法典》，亡灵没有权利，不能继承头衔或土地。图尔的挑战像野火一样蔓延开来，只是当凯乌斯三世在正午的阳光下与军阀们见面并割开他的手掌以显示他自由流淌的血液时，他的挑战被粉碎了。",
	"This should have been the end of it, but the tale of the Vampire King has proven surprisingly resilient. Some say that the king developed special enchantments to avoid the effects of sunlight; others say that he has relies on changeling impersonators to take his place in the daylight. As for Drago Thul, he refused to stand down when Kaius III pushed for peace and the Treaty of Thronehold.

	"One question remained: What had become of the ancient dwarves? The answer soon became apparent. As the Mror delved deeper into the Realm Below, they woke an ancient evil: {@creature Dyrrn|ERLW} the Corruptor, a daelkyr lord of madness. Hordes of aberrations and derro rose from the depths to challenge the explorers. For decades, the Mror lords have been fighting a battle in the depths, struggling to drive the darkness from their ancestral halls. Many dwarves revile anything to do with the daelkyr. Others believe that the daelkyr can grant the Mror dwarves the power to overcome any enemy.

	"{@b Pride in Possessions}. From the wealthiest clan lord to the humblest miner, the Mror take great pride in their possessions. Quality is more important than appearance, and you are interested in the history of the items you carry.

Great wealth and arcane secrets remain hidden in these halls, along with endless hordes of aberrations. As a Mror adventurer, you could help your family reclaim lands from the Realm Below, or you could lead your allies into the deep in search of wealth and glory.": "没有人知道在铁根山脉深处的古老矮人帝国的范围和深度。巨大的财富和神秘的秘密仍然隐藏在这些大厅里，同时还有无尽的反常者。作为一名Moror冒险家，你可以帮助你的家族从地下世界夺回土地，也可以带领你的盟友进入深处寻找财富和荣耀。",
	"The Mror Holds declared independence during the Last War. Many nations depend on the resource of the Holds, and the Treaty of Thronehold affirmed its sovereignty.": "Mror Holds在上次战争期间宣布独立。许多国家依赖于霍尔兹的资源，《王座条约》确认了它的主权。",
	"To the casual observer, the Mror dwarves' star appears to be rising. Their mines seem to offer limitless resources. Mror artificers make amazing strides as they study the relics of their ancestors. The dwarves are proud of their ancient past and optimistic about the future. Most Mror are generous and courageous, eager to show off their wealth and accomplishments.": "对于不经意的观察者来说，Moror矮人的明星似乎正在崛起。他们的矿场似乎提供了无限的资源。在研究他们祖先的遗物时，Moror的工匠们取得了惊人的进步。矮人对他们古老的过去感到骄傲，对未来感到乐观。大多数Moror人慷慨而勇敢，热衷于炫耀他们的财富和成就。",
	"Those who dig deeper realize that this prosperity is built on an unstable foundation. The Last War may be over, but the war against the daelkyr has barely begun. The clan lords hold their reclaimed halls in the Realm Below, but no one knows the full extent of the power of the daelkyr. A renewed assault could come at any time, whether it's a force of monsters boiling up from below or a creeping madness that infects the weak-willed.": "深入研究的人意识到，这种繁荣是建立在不稳定的基础上的。最后的战争可能已经结束，但对达尔凯尔的战争才刚刚开始。氏族领主们守着他们在下界收回的大厅，但没有人知道daelkyr的全部力量。新的攻击随时可能到来，无论是从下面沸腾起来的怪物力量还是感染意志薄弱者的蠕动的疯狂。",
	"The dwarves are also divided by their attitude toward the aberrations. Some of the clans—notably Soldorak—embrace symbionts and other daelkyr gifts; some even experiment with flesh-warping techniques and create their own monsters. Others—notably Clan Mroranon—avoid contact with the aberrations. Such dwarves treasure the relics of their ancestors but despise those who use symbionts or form pacts with the darkness.": "矮人也因其对反常者的态度而分裂。一些部族--特别是索多拉克部族--接受共生体和其他daelkyr的礼物；一些部族甚至尝试肉体扭曲技术，并创造他们自己的怪物。其他人--特别是姆罗拉农氏族--则避免与反常者接触。这些矮人珍惜他们祖先的遗物，但鄙视那些使用共生体或与黑暗签订契约的人。",
	"Long ago, the dwarves engaged in vicious feuds that kept them from uniting as a nation. This new divide could reignite those rivalries, leading to a civil war on the surface even as evil gains strength in the depths.": "很久以前，矮人参与了恶性的争斗，使他们无法作为一个国家团结起来。这种新的分裂可能会重新点燃这些争斗，导致表面上的内战，甚至邪恶在深处获得力量。",
	"To their surprise, Q'barra was already home to a number of ancient civilizations humans know nothing about: the lizardfolk of the Cold Sun Federation, the dragonborn of Ka'rhashan, and the confederacy of the Poison Dusk lizardfolk. Most settlers refer to them collectively as \"scales.\" King Sebastes ir'Kesslan of Newthrone has established a treaty with the Cold Sun Federation, but communication has been difficult and prospectors rarely abide by the terms of the treaty.": "令他们惊讶的是，Q'barra已经是一些人类一无所知的古老文明的家园：冷阳联邦的蜥蜴人、卡哈山的龙裔，以及毒黄昏蜥蜴人的联盟。大多数定居者把他们统称为 \"鳞片\"。纽斯隆的国王塞巴斯蒂安-伊尔-凯斯兰（Sebastes ir'Kesslan）与冷阳联邦签订了条约，但沟通一直很困难，探矿者很少遵守条约的条款。",
	"Q'barra is one of the richest sources of Eberron dragonshards in Khorvaire, drawing waves of settlers and prospectors to this young and growing nation on the edge of civilization.": "Q'barra是Khorvaire最丰富的Eberron龙碎片来源之一，吸引了一波又一波的定居者和勘探者来到这个位于文明边缘的年轻而成长的国家。",
	"Certain ruins in Q'barra appear connected to the Age of Demons. The settlers know little of the history of this region, but the Poison Dusk lizardfolk have ties to fiendish powers.": "Q'barra的某些遗迹似乎与恶魔时代有关。定居者对这个地区的历史知之甚少，但毒黄昏蜥蜴人与恶魔的力量有联系。",
	"House Tharashk has a strong presence in Q'barra. Tharashk is the primary buyer of Eberron dragonshards and also runs large-scale mining operations here.": "Tharashk家族在Q'barra有很强的影响力。萨拉什克是艾伯伦龙碎片的主要买家，也在这里经营大规模的采矿业务。",
	"Q'barra tempts explorers from the west with the prospects of wealth and new lands to conquer—mostly humans but including members of all races found in Khorvaire. Settlers, dragonborn, and lizardfolk characters who originate here should consider the following:": "Q'barra以财富和可以征服的新土地的前景诱惑着来自西方的探险者--主要是人类，但也包括在Khorvaire发现的所有种族的成员。来自这里的定居者、龙裔和蜥蜴人角色应该考虑以下问题。",
	"{@b Settlers}. Q'barra is an excellent place to explore the traditional archetypes of the classic Western. As a paladin, you could be a lone sheriff seeking to protect your newly formed mining village. Your cleric could be the town preacher. As a sorcerer or bard with a criminal background, you could be a dashing wandslinger looking for trouble and gold.": "{@b Settlers}. Q'barra是一个探索经典西部片的传统原型的绝佳场所。作为一个圣骑士，你可以是一个孤独的警长，寻求保护你新成立的采矿村。你的牧师可以是镇上的传教士。作为一个有犯罪背景的巫师或吟游诗人，你可以成为一个寻找麻烦和黄金的潇洒的巫师。",
	"{@b Renegades and Regrets}. Q'barra promises a land of opportunity and a place where you can leave your past behind. Are you a deserter? Were you convicted of a crime you didn't commit? Are you fleeing from a broken heart? Q'barra has also drawn Cyran refugees and newly freed warforged, both seeking a home in the wild east.": "{@b Renegades and Regrets}. Q'barra承诺是一片充满机会的土地，是一个你可以抛弃过去的地方。你是一个逃兵吗？你是否被判定犯有你没有犯过的罪行？你是在逃离一颗破碎的心吗？Q'barra也吸引了Cyran难民和新获释的战争锻造者，他们都在荒凉的东部寻找一个家。",
	"{@b Lizardfolk}. The lizardfolk's primitive culture blends druidic traditions with the beliefs of the Silver Flame. You might have been sent to study the softskins—to learn about them and potentially serve as an envoy for your people. Alternatively, you could be following a spiritual vision.": "{@b Lizardfolk}. 蜥蜴人的原始文化融合了德鲁伊的传统和银焰的信仰。你可能被派去研究软皮人--了解他们，并有可能成为你们民族的特使。另外，你也可能是在追随一个精神上的愿景。",
	"{@b Dragonborn}. The dragonborn live amid the remnants of ancient glory. They have a proud martial tradition, and a number of dragonborn venture west in search of worthy challenges. If you follow this path, you might have served as a mercenary in the Last War.": "{@b Dragonborn}. 龙族生活在古代荣耀的残余之中。他们有一个自豪的武术传统，一些龙裔冒险去西部寻找值得挑战的东西。如果你走这条路，你可能曾在最后的战争中担任过雇佣兵。",
	"Q'barra is split into three main regions. New Galifar is the original colony; it has a feudal structure and holds to the laws of the Treaty of Thronehold. To the north, Hope is a collection of small mining towns. In Hope, the law goes only as far as the people willing to enforce it. Beyond these human regions lie the unexplored lands of the scales.": "Q'barra被分成三个主要区域。新加利法尔是最初的殖民地；它有一个封建的结构，并遵守《王权条约》的法律。在北部，希望镇是一个小型采矿镇的集合。在希望岛，法律的效力只及于愿意执行它的人。在这些人类地区之外，是未被开发的天平之地。",
	"Explorers tell stories of a city hidden deep in the jungles of Q'barra—a wondrous citadel of obsidian and brass. According to these tales, the city is filled with treasure and guarded by a dragon fused with an ancient demon.": "探险家们讲述了一个隐藏在Q'barra丛林深处的城市--一个由黑曜石和黄铜组成的奇妙城堡。根据这些传说，这座城市充满了宝藏，并由一条与古代恶魔融合的龙守护着。",
	"The capital of New Galifar and the seat of King Sebastes, Newthrone is the largest city and port in Q'barra. Myriad people from all over Khorvaire mingle here in crowded streets. Soldiers pay little heed to the rampant crime in these streets, viewing it instead as part of life in the port city.": "纽斯隆是新加利法尔的首都，也是塞巴斯提斯国王的所在地，是库巴拉最大的城市和港口。来自霍尔韦尔各地的无数人在这里混迹于拥挤的街道。士兵们对这些街道上猖獗的犯罪行为不闻不问，而是将其视为港口城市生活的一部分。",
	"A thriving prospecting town in Hope, Wyrmwatch was established by Cyran refugees. Although far smaller than New Cyre in Breland, its people are proud of what they have built. The independent community is led by Elder Nevillom, a veteran and evangelist of the Silver Flame. Nevillom's courage and passionate sermons help sustain the people of Wyrmwatch in difficult times.": "Wyrmwatch是希望城中一个繁荣的探矿镇，由Cyran难民建立。虽然远远小于布雷兰的新赛尔，但其人民对他们所建立的一切感到自豪。这个独立的社区由长老Nevillom领导，他是银色火焰的老兵和传教士。内维罗姆的勇气和热情的布道帮助维尔姆观察的人们在困难时期维持生计。",
	"The influx of Cyran refugees promises to reshape Q'barra. Most of the settlers are peaceful people searching for a homes and opportunities, but some among them chose Q'barra over refugee camps because they refused to accept charity from former enemies. These \"Mourners\" rob and kill settlers from the nations that fought against Cyre. Hope also has its share of brigands and criminals, bandits who prey on House Tharashk convoys and settlers alike.": "西兰难民的涌入有望重塑Q'barra。大多数定居者都是寻找家园和机会的和平人士，但他们中的一些人选择了Q'barra而不是难民营，因为他们拒绝接受前敌人的施舍。这些 \"送葬者 \"抢劫和杀害来自与赛尔作战的国家的定居者。希望之城也有一些强盗和罪犯，他们是掠夺塔拉什克家族车队和定居者的强盗。",
	"The relationship between the settlers and the natives is another source of tension. Although King Sebastes forged a treaty with the Cold Sun Federation, the prospectors of Hope regularly violate this treaty. The Poison Dusk lizardfolk are hostile to both the settlers and the Cold Sun Federation. Conflicts between settlers and scales have escalated over the last four years, and many fear that worse is yet to come.": "定居者和当地人之间的关系是另一个紧张的根源。虽然塞巴斯蒂安国王与冷阳联邦签订了条约，但希望之城的探矿者经常违反这一条约。毒黄昏蜥蜴人对定居者和冷阳联邦都有敌意。在过去的四年里，定居者和鳞片之间的冲突不断升级，许多人担心更糟糕的事情还在后面。",
	"When most people think of the Shadow Marches, they imagine a fetid backwater where illiterate humans mingle with orcs and other foul creatures, practicing strange rites by the light of the moons. While flawed, this vision isn't entirely inaccurate. The Shadow Marches are a desolate land of swamps and moors. The homeland of the orcs, the Marches were scarred in the ancient conflict with the daelkyr. The fiends left twisted creatures and aberrations in the swamps, and sowed seeds of madness that linger to this day. There are indeed moonlit rituals in the Marches: some to honor the daelkyr, others to maintain the wards that keep them trapped in Khyber.": "当大多数人想到阴影地带时，他们想象的是一个腥臭的落后地区，在那里，不识字的人类与兽人和其他肮脏的生物混杂在一起，在月亮的光芒下进行奇怪的仪式。虽然有缺陷，但这种设想并不完全准确。影子牧场是一片荒凉的沼泽和荒野之地。作为兽人的故乡，沼泽地在与达尔凯尔的古老冲突中留下了伤痕。魔鬼们在沼泽地里留下了扭曲的生物和畸形的东西，并播下了疯狂的种子，直到今天还在继续。沼泽地里确实有月光仪式：有些是为了纪念达尔凯尔，有些是为了维持将他们困在开伯尔的护卫。",
	"Humans came to the Marches long ago, refugees fleeing a war in the distant land of Sarlona. Over time the two cultures merged, forming the Marches as they exist today.": "很久以前，人类就来到了马奇，他们是逃离遥远的萨洛纳土地上的战争的难民。随着时间的推移，这两种文化融合在一起，形成了今天的马奇地区。",
	"The Marches had little contact with the Kingdom of Galifar or the east until a few hundred years ago, when a House Sivis expedition made two discoveries: the region contained valuable dragonshards, and a number of clans had manifested the Dragonmark of Finding. This led to the foundation of House Tharashk, as these clans joined together to master the economic potential of their mark and leverage their mineral wealth.": "马奇地区与加利法尔王国或东部地区几乎没有联系，直到几百年前，西维斯家族的一支探险队有了两个发现：该地区有宝贵的龙石，而且一些部族已经显现出寻找龙纹的功能。这导致了塔拉什克家族的建立，因为这些部族联合起来掌握了他们标记的经济潜力并利用了他们的矿产财富。",
	"The Shadow Marches aren't a nation. No one voice speaks for the clans and tribes, and most of the tribes have no interest in dealing with outsiders. House Tharashk is the largest faction in the region, and their city of Zarash'ak is the center for commerce.": "影子牧场并不是一个国家。没有一个声音能代表各个部族和部落，而且大多数部落都没有兴趣与外来者打交道。萨拉什克家族是该地区最大的派系，他们的城市扎拉什阿克是商业中心。",
	"House Tharashk is the main point of contact between the Shadow Marches and the outside world. Tharashk aside, the region remains a collection of tribes and cultists following their ancient traditions in the shadows of the swamps.": "萨拉什克家族是阴影地带与外部世界的主要联系点。除了塔拉什克，该地区仍然是一个部落和崇拜者的集合体，他们在沼泽的阴影下遵循着古老的传统。",
	"The untamed Shadow Marches are filled with mysteries. Relics of the daelkyr rest undisturbed in the depths of the swamps, along with foul monsters and druidic shrines.": "桀骜不驯的阴影地带充满了神秘感。daelkyr的遗迹在沼泽的深处未被打扰，还有肮脏的怪物和德鲁伊的神殿。",
	"The Marches are the birthplace of the druidic tradition of the Gatekeepers. Long ago, this sect defeated the vile daelkyr; today, its last champions continue to protect Eberron from aberrations and other extraplanar threats.": "牧场是德鲁伊传统 \"守门人 \"的发源地。很久以前，这个教派打败了邪恶的达尔凯尔；今天，它最后的冠军们继续保护艾伯伦免受异端和其他星外威胁。",
	"Even in defeat, the daelkyr sowed seeds of madness in the Marches. Followers of the Cults of the Dragon Below remain scattered across the region. Some of these cults work with mind flayers and other aberrations. Others have no evil intent but are driven by dangerous delusions.": "即使失败了，达尔凯尔也在马尔凯斯播下了疯狂的种子。下龙教的追随者仍然散布在整个地区。这些邪教中的一些人与精神分裂者和其他反常者一起工作。其他人没有邪恶的意图，但被危险的妄想所驱使。",
	"As you develop a Marcher character or NPC, consider the following:": "当你开发一个行军者角色或NPC时，请考虑以下几点。",
	"{@b The Mark of Finding.} An alliance of Marcher clans formed House Tharashk, but not all those who carried the mark chose to join this house. As a half-orc with the Mark of Finding, you could be a child of the Marches with a strong tie to the house, or you could be a scion of a small tribe of hunters, proud of your independence and suspicious of the houses. Your ties to the Marches might be distant because you were born to a family that left years ago. Do you want to rediscover your ancestral roots?": "{@b The Mark of Finding.}马奇家族的联盟形成了塔拉什克家族，但并不是所有携带印记的人都选择加入这个家族。作为一个拥有 \"寻找印记 \"的半兽人，你可能是一个与马奇家族有着紧密联系的孩子，也可能是一个小型猎人部落的后代，为自己的独立感到骄傲，并对各家族充满怀疑。你与马奇家族的联系可能是遥远的，因为你出生在一个多年前就离开的家庭。你想重新找到你的祖先的根吗？",
	"{@b Clan or Tribe}? The people of the Shadow Marches are split into two distinct cultures. The clans blend the traditions of human and orc, building towns and working with steel. If you were raised in one of the clans, the ways of civilization aren't that strange to you; you've seen the city of Zarash'ak and worked with House Tharashk. By contrast, the Marcher tribes maintain traditions that predate humanity. As nomadic hunter-gatherers, they don't work metals; they make their tools from stone, hide, wood, and bone. If your character is from one of the Marcher tribes, you might be the first of your people to leave the swamps. Why have you left your people, and how are you adapting to this new world?": "{@b Clan or Tribe}? 影子牧场的人们分为两种不同的文化。氏族融合了人类和兽人的传统，建造城镇并与钢铁打交道。如果你在其中一个部族长大，文明的方式对你来说并不陌生；你见过扎拉什阿克城，并与塔拉什克家族合作。相比之下，马歇尔部落保持着人类之前的传统。作为游牧的狩猎采集者，他们不使用金属；他们用石头、兽皮、木材和骨头制作工具。如果你的角色来自马歇尔部落之一，你可能是你的族人中第一个离开沼泽的人。你为什么要离开你的人民，你是如何适应这个新世界的？",
	"The Shadow Marches hold deposits of Eberron dragonshards, the source of House Tharashk's wealth. These fields aren't as rich as those in Q'barra, but there's gold to be made by those willing to hunt for shards in the dangerous swamps.": "阴影地带拥有艾伯伦龙碎片的矿藏，这是塔拉什克家族的财富来源。这些矿场并不像卡巴拉（Q'barra）那样富饶，但那些愿意在危险的沼泽地里猎取龙碎片的人可以赚取黄金。",
	"The green dragon Vvaraak is said to have taught the secrets of druidic magic to the first Gatekeepers thousands of years ago. Though Vvaraak is long dead, rumors say that her hidden lair holds secrets tied to the Draconic Prophecy and the mysteries of druidic magic.": "绿龙瓦拉亚克（Vvaraak）据说在几千年前将德鲁伊魔法的秘密传授给了第一批守门人。虽然弗瓦拉克早已死亡，但有传言说她的隐秘巢穴里有与德鲁伊预言和德鲁伊魔法之谜有关的秘密。",
	"Because overland travel through Droaam or the Eldeen Reaches can be extremely dangerous, most people who need to do business in the Marches travel by ship to the port city of Zarash'ak. Built on stilts and known for its cuisine and music, Zarash'ak offers the rare exports of the land without the difficulty of navigating the swamps. House Tharashk oversees the City of Stilts, but Marcher clans and tribes come here to sell crafts and other goods or to celebrate religious rituals.": "由于在陆路上穿越德罗阿姆（Droaam）或艾尔迪恩海滩（Eldeen Reaches）是非常危险的，大多数需要在马尔凯斯做生意的人都会乘船前往港口城市扎拉什阿克（Zarash'ak）。扎拉什阿克建在高跷上，以其美食和音乐而闻名，它提供了罕见的土地出口，而没有沼泽地的航行困难。塔拉什克家族负责监督高跷之城，但马奇家族和部落也来这里出售工艺品和其他物品，或庆祝宗教仪式。",
	"The Shadow Marches aren't a nation, and the region wasn't recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold. Most Marchers have little interest in the outside world. Marcher tribes don't know the names or number of the nations beyond the swamps, let alone that they were at war. However, as House Tharashk gains power and influence in the world beyond the swamps, it has increased its presence in its homeland. The house has expanded Zarash'ak dramatically over the last decade and is working on transforming other towns into cities. This has caused tension with a number of tribes. And House Tharashk's mining operations and its urban expansion always run the risk of disrupting Gatekeeper seals and unleashing ancient evils bound beneath the Marches.": "暗影行军不是一个国家，该地区也没有得到《王权条约》的承认。大多数行军者对外面的世界没有什么兴趣。游行者部落不知道沼泽地以外的国家的名称和数量，更不知道它们曾发生过战争。然而，随着塔拉什克家族在沼泽地以外的世界获得权力和影响力，它也增加了在其家乡的存在。在过去的十年里，该家族急剧扩张扎拉什阿克，并正在努力将其他城镇改造成城市。这已经引起了与一些部落的紧张关系。而塔拉什克家族的采矿作业和城市扩张总是有可能破坏守门人的封印，并释放出束缚在沼泽地下的古老邪恶。",
	"The halflings of the Talenta Plains have no cities and no industrialized magic, but they do have dinosaurs. The halflings domesticated the dinosaurs of the plains and use these creatures as mounts, livestock, and beasts of burden. A sacred bond exists between a hunter and mount, and few people are prepared to face a raging halfling barbarian riding a furious clawfoot raptor.": "塔伦塔平原的半身人没有城市，没有工业化的魔法，但他们有恐龙。半身人驯化了平原上的恐龙，并将这些生物作为坐骑、牲畜和负担的野兽。猎人和坐骑之间存在着一种神圣的联系，很少有人准备面对一个骑着愤怒的爪足猛禽的半身人野蛮人。",
	"Talenta religion reveres spirits, both departed ancestors and natural spirits. Each tribe has a lath—a chieftain who guides the tribe—and shamans who consult the spirits and choose the paths of migration.": "塔伦塔宗教崇尚神灵，包括离世的祖先和自然神灵。每个部落都有一个首领--指导部落的首领，以及咨询神灵和选择迁移路线的巫师。",
	"In the past, the tribes stood alone, but during the Last War, many halflings came together under Lathon Halpum to defend their land. Halpum won recognition for the Plains as one of the Thronehold nations, though it's still unclear what this means beyond increasing passage between the Plains and the outside world.": "在过去，这些部落是单独存在的，但在最后一次战争中，许多半身人在拉顿-哈尔普姆的领导下团结起来，保卫他们的土地。哈尔普姆为平原赢得了对其作为王座国家之一的认可，尽管目前还不清楚这除了增加平原和外部世界的通道外还意味着什么。",
	"House Ghallanda and House Jorasco both originated in the Talenta Plains. The dragonmarked bloodlines appear throughout the tribes, though you can play a dragonmarked halfling from the Plains who doesn't work for the houses.": "Ghallanda家族和Jorasco家族都起源于Talenta平原。龙纹血统出现在整个部落中，尽管你可以扮演一个来自平原的龙纹半身人，他不为这些家族工作。",
	"Stories tell of ancient ruins that date back to the first age of the world and of a vast graveyard holding the bones of dragons.": "故事讲述了可以追溯到世界第一个时代的古老遗迹，以及保存着龙的骨头的巨大墓地。",
	"See chapter 1 for quirks and other features relevant to halfling characters from the Talenta Plains. Also consider the following:": "关于来自塔伦塔平原的半身人角色的怪癖和其他特征，请参见第1章。还可以考虑以下内容。",
	"{@b Wild Warriors and Tricksters.} You were born in the wild, and your wits and your weapons helped you survive. Talenta warriors are often barbarians or rangers, relying on speed and skill. Outlander is a logical background, but you could easily be a folk hero, entertainer, or charlatan. You could even be an urchin who was stranded in a great city and adapted to life there.": "{@b Wild Warriors and Tricksters.} 你出生在野外，你的智慧和武器帮助你生存。Talenta战士通常是野蛮人或游侠，依靠速度和技巧。外地人是一个合乎逻辑的背景，但你很容易成为一个民间英雄、艺人或江湖骗子。你甚至可以是一个滞留在大城市并适应了那里生活的顽童。",
	"{@b Surrounded by Spirits}. Fey, fiends, and the ghosts of ancestors, these are all part of the spirit world, and they're all around you. Do you believe that the spirits guide your actions? Do you show respect to the spirits of a location? Talentan shamans tend to be druids of the Circle of the Moon or the Circle of the Shepherd (from {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}), often assuming the form of dinosaurs. You could also reflect a strong bond to spirits by playing a warlock with an Archfey patron, a cleric with the Nature domain, a paladin sworn to the Oath of the Ancients, or a barbarian on the Path of the Totem Warrior or Path of the Ancestral Guardian (from {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}). Hermit and outlander are natural backgrounds, but you could be an acolyte or a sage who consults spirits instead of books. Warriors and shamans both wear masks to present a particular face to the spirit world.": "{@b Surrounded by Spirits}. 恶魔、魔鬼和祖先的鬼魂，这些都是精神世界的一部分，它们就在你身边。你相信神灵会指导你的行动吗？你会对一个地方的神灵表示尊重吗？才人萨满往往是月亮圈或牧羊人圈的德鲁伊（来自{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}），经常会化身为恐龙的样子。你也可以通过扮演一个拥有大法师守护者的术士、一个拥有自然领域的牧师、一个宣誓遵守古人誓言的圣骑士，或者一个走图腾战士之路或祖先守护者之路的野蛮人（从{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}开始）来反映与精神的强烈联系。隐士和外乡人是天然的背景，但你也可以是一个圣徒或一个咨询精神而不是书籍的圣人。战士和巫师都戴着面具，向精神世界展示一个特殊的面孔。",
	"{@b Dinosaurs}. Talenta halflings have a close bond to their dinosaur companions. If you don't begin the campaign with a dinosaur mount or companion, you might acquire one over the course of your adventures. You can also consider whether a fallen dinosaur is part of your backstory; perhaps you lost your faithful mount in the Last War, but you believe its spirit is still with you.": "{@b Dinosaurs}. 塔伦塔半身人与他们的恐龙伙伴有着密切的联系。如果你在活动开始时没有恐龙坐骑或同伴，你可能会在冒险过程中获得一个。你也可以考虑堕落的恐龙是否是你背景故事的一部分；也许你在最后的战争中失去了你忠实的坐骑，但你相信它的精神仍然与你同在。",
	"The Talenta Plains have been described as an ocean of grasslands. The nomadic halflings have little interest in building towns; most shelter in the Talenta Plains is temporary. Halflings shun the ruins scattered across the Plains, believing them to be haunted by fiends.": "塔伦塔平原被描述为草原的海洋。游牧的半身人对建造城镇没有什么兴趣；塔伦塔平原上的大部分住所都是临时的。半身人回避散落在平原上的废墟，认为它们被恶魔所困扰。",
	"All the halfling tribes come to Gatherhold to trade, hold councils, and settle disputes. House Ghallanda maintains the town, but Gatherhold belongs to the people, not the houses. Other dragonmarked houses offer their services here as well. The town is on the shore of Lake Cyre, and once people came by boat through Cyre; now the Mourning has cut off that passage.": "所有的半身人部落都来到Gatherhold进行贸易，召开会议，解决争端。Ghallanda家族维护着这个小镇，但Gatherhold属于人民，而不是家族。其他有龙纹的家族也在这里提供服务。该镇位于赛尔湖畔，人们曾经乘船穿过赛尔湖；现在，哀伤已经切断了这条通道。",
	"This caravan maintained by members of House Ghallanda is a traveling fair, providing entertainment and shelter to any fortunate enough to cross its path. When times are dark and travelers are weary, one can always hope that the Wandering Inn is just beyond the horizon.": "这个由加兰达家族成员维护的商队是一个旅行集市，为任何有幸穿越它的人提供娱乐和庇护。当时代是黑暗的，旅行者是疲惫的，人们总是希望流浪的旅店就在地平线的另一端。",
	"The halfling tribes joined together to defend themselves from outsiders, and the Talenta Plains were recognized as a nation under the Treaty of Thronehold. Now that the war is over, most of the tribes have returned to their hunting grounds and ancient traditions. They united to defend their way of life, and now they wish to enjoy it.": "半身人部落联合起来抵御外来者，根据《王座条约》，塔伦塔平原被承认为一个国家。现在，战争结束了，大多数部落都回到了他们的狩猎场和古老的传统中。他们团结起来捍卫自己的生活方式，现在他们希望能享受这种生活。",
	"But the halflings don't yet know if it's possible to return to the previous ways. More foreigners visit the Plains than at any time in the past. Settlers and merchants cross the Plains as they make their way to Q'barra, and they clash with Q'barran bandits. The Valenar elves ride through the Plains in search of adventure. Monsters emerge from the Mournland. Dragonmarked houses seek to expand their role at Gatherhold and to explore the untapped resources of the Plains.": "但半身人还不知道是否有可能回到以前的方式。访问平原的外国人比过去任何时候都多。定居者和商人在前往卡巴拉的路上穿过平原，他们与卡巴拉的强盗发生冲突。瓦勒纳（Valenar）的精灵们骑马穿过平原寻找冒险。怪物从哀伤之地涌现。龙印家族寻求扩大他们在加瑟霍德的作用，并探索平原上未开发的资源。",
	"The halflings have no interest in change, but it might be inevitable. Lathon Halpum believes that if the tribes can work together, they could become a nation of nations, but others aggressively oppose such a path. Holy Uldra is a powerful shaman and the leader of her own tribe. She urges halfling warriors to join together for a single purpose: to drive all outsiders from the Plains and to maintain the ancient traditions. The halflings must decide whether the tribes will choose the path of peace or return to war.": "半身人对变革没有兴趣，但这可能是不可避免的。拉顿-哈尔普姆认为，如果各部落能够合作，他们可以成为一个国家的国家，但其他人积极反对这样的道路。神圣的Uldra是一个强大的萨满，也是她自己部落的领袖。她敦促半身人战士们为了一个目的而联合起来：把所有外来者赶出平原，并保持古老的传统。半身人必须决定部落是选择和平之路，还是重返战争。",
	"Growing up on the streets of the Callestan district in Sharn, I learned not to put my faith in anything I couldn't see or hold. I think that's why my editor sent me to Flamekeep to cover the Ascension; surely I'd see clearly, with eyes untouched by faith. I thought so, too. But then I found myself in the Chamber of Tira's Sacrifice, a pillar of silver fire marking the spot where one woman gave her life to protect countless innocents. I saw people from all nations joined together in song, celebrating both that ancient sacrifice and the end of our current war. And looking into the innocent eyes of the child priestess, I truly heard the words of that song for the first time: a call for all of us to be better than we are, to protect those in need, to remember that we are all one people in the light of the Silver Flame.": "在沙恩的卡利斯坦区的街道上长大，我学会了不把我的信仰放在任何我看不到或拿不到的东西上。我想这就是为什么我的编辑派我去Flamekeep报道升天仪式；我肯定会看得清楚，用没有被信仰影响的眼睛。我也这么想。但后来我发现自己身处提拉的祭祀厅，一根银色的火柱标志着一个女人为保护无数无辜者而献出生命的地方。我看到来自所有国家的人们在一起唱歌，庆祝那个古老的牺牲和我们目前战争的结束。看着女祭司的天真无邪的眼睛，我第一次真正听到了那首歌的歌词：呼吁我们所有人变得比我们自己更好，保护那些需要帮助的人，记住我们在银色火焰的光芒下都是一个民族。",
	"The modern Church of the Silver Flame was founded in Thrane, and most of the people of the nation follow this faith. During the Last War, the people of Thrane chose to set aside the rule of the monarchy and to embrace the leadership of the church. For the last seventy years, Thrane has been a theocracy. The head of the state is 11-year-old Jaela Daran, the divinely selected Keeper of the Flame. Jaela depends on the Council of Cardinals to perform the practical work of running the nation.": "现代的银焰教会在瑟兰成立，全国大部分人都信奉这一信仰。在最后一次战争中，瑟兰的人民选择将君主制的统治放在一边，接受教会的领导。在过去的七十年里，瑟兰一直是一个神权国家。国家元首是11岁的杰拉-达兰，神选的火焰守护者。杰拉依靠红衣主教会议来完成管理国家的实际工作。",
	"The primary purpose of the Silver Flame is to defend the innocent from supernatural evil. The church has always had a militant aspect, with battalions of templars and peasant militias prepared to face undead, lycanthropes, or other monstrous threats. But compassion and charity are core values of the church, and the templars are tasked to defend all innocents. Even during the Last War, if a fiendish threat arose in a Brelish village, Thrane templars would ally with the locals to bring an end to the threat. Not all Thranes rise to this ideal. Zealous Thranes believe the church is destined to reunite Galifar under the Silver Flame, and corrupt priests are interested only in power and wealth.": "银色火焰的主要目的是保护无辜者免遭超自然的邪恶。教会一直都有好战的一面，圣殿骑士营和农民民兵准备面对亡灵、狼人或其他可怕的威胁。但怜悯和慈善是教会的核心价值，圣殿骑士的任务是保护所有无辜者。即使在最后一次战争期间，如果一个布雷利什村庄出现了邪恶的威胁，瑟兰圣殿骑士会与当地人结盟以结束威胁。并非所有瑟兰人都能达到这一理想。狂热的瑟兰人相信教会注定要在银色火焰下重新统一加利法尔，而腐败的牧师们只对权力和财富感兴趣。",
	"Not all priests are clerics, and the typical templar is a mundane warrior. However, due to the deep faith of its people, Thrane produces more clerics and paladins than any other nation in Khorvaire.": "并非所有的牧师都是神职人员，典型的圣殿骑士是一个世俗的战士。然而，由于其人民的深刻信仰，瑟兰产生的牧师和圣骑士比霍尔韦尔的任何其他国家都多。",
	"Every town has a militia ready to deal with supernatural threats, and people stand together to fight darkness. Champions of the light find support and hospitality, but any character who dabbles with dark forces—necromancers, warlocks, and the like—finds Thrane a dangerous, unwelcoming place.": "每个城镇都有一支民兵队伍，准备应对超自然的威胁，人们团结一致，共同对抗黑暗。光明的拥护者会得到支持和款待，但任何涉足黑暗势力的人物--巫师、术士等--都会发现瑟兰是一个危险的、不受欢迎的地方。",
	"The feudal system of nobility remains in place, but ultimate authority rests in the hands of the church. Queen Diani ir'Wynarn is the \"blood regent,\" serving as a symbolic advisor to the Keeper of the Flame. A small fraction of the population would like to see the traditional monarchy restored to power.": "封建的贵族制度仍然存在，但最终的权力掌握在教会手中。迪亚尼-伊尔-维纳恩女王是 \"血缘摄政者\"，充当火焰守护者的象征性顾问。一小部分人希望看到传统的君主制恢复权力。",
	"As you develop a Thrane character, consider the following details:": "当你培养一个Shrane角色时，考虑以下细节。",
	"{@b The Impact of Faith.} If you want to reflect a close bond to the Silver Flame, you could gain a few divine spells by taking the Magic Initiate feat. Archery is a devotional practice of the Silver Flame, so as a martial Thrane you might focus on archery-related combat styles or take the Sharpshooter feat. Any Thrane could take the acolyte background to reflect a strong connection to the church or the soldier background based on service with the templars.": "{@b The Impact of Faith.}如果你想反映出与银色火焰的紧密联系，你可以通过参加魔法入门者特技获得一些神圣的法术。射箭是银色火焰的一种虔诚修行，所以作为一个武者，你可以专注于与射箭有关的战斗方式，或者采取神射手的特技。任何鲛人都可以选择圣职者背景，以反映与教会的紧密联系，或者选择基于为圣殿骑士服务的士兵背景。",
	"{@b Church or Crown}? Do you support the theocracy, or would you like to see power restored to the throne? Many people of faith believe that miring the church in politics distracts it and invites corruption.": "{@b Church or Crown}? 你支持神权，还是希望看到权力重新回到王位上来？许多有信仰的人认为，让教会陷入政治的泥潭会分散其注意力，并招致腐败。",
	"{@b Dealing with Darkness}. The Shadow in the Flame can tempt even the most virtuous soul. How do you react when you encounter corruption and greed? Are you a compassionate person who seeks to lead people to the light, or a zealot determined to crush all darkness?": "{@b Dealing with Darkness}. 火焰中的阴影甚至可以引诱最善良的灵魂。当你遇到腐败和贪婪时，你会如何反应？你是一个有同情心的人，试图引导人们走向光明，还是一个决心粉碎所有黑暗的狂热者？",
	"The Church of the Silver Flame is a militant faith, and Thrane communities are built around fortified churches designed to serve as fortresses in times of trouble. Larger towns maintain sturdy walls patrolled by skilled archers. A Flamic architectural style appears throughout the region. Buildings incorporate light and soaring spaces, and icons of the Silver Flame and images of the martyr Tira Miron appear throughout the nation.": "银焰教会是一种好战的信仰，瑟兰社区围绕着坚固的教堂而建，目的是在困难时期充当堡垒。较大的城镇保持着坚固的城墙，由熟练的弓箭手进行巡逻。整个地区出现了弗拉米克的建筑风格。建筑物融入了光线和高耸的空间，银色火焰的图标和烈士提拉-米隆的图像出现在整个国家。",
	"The spiritual heart and capital of Thrane, Flamekeep is a massive fortress city. The Keeper of the Flame dwells in the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame, which holds the pillar of fire born when Tira Miron sacrificed herself to bind the demon Bel Shalor. The cathedral is the seat of the Council of Cardinals and the primary garrison of the templar order. Flamekeep is also home to Thalingard, the ancestral palace of the rulers of Thrane and current residence of Queen Diani ir'Wynarn.": "火焰城是瑟兰的精神中心和首都，是一座巨大的要塞城市。火焰守护者居住在伟大的银色火焰大教堂里，那里有蒂拉-米隆牺牲自己来束缚恶魔贝尔-沙洛时诞生的火柱。大教堂是红衣主教会议的所在地，也是圣殿骑士团的主要驻扎地。火焰城也是塔林加德（Thalingard）的所在地，它是瑟兰统治者的祖传宫殿，也是戴安娜-伊尔-维纳恩女王目前的住所。",
	"Shadukar is a grim reminder of the cost of the war. Once known as the Jewel of the Sound, this coastal city was destroyed in a bitter siege against Karrnathi forces. The city has yet to be reclaimed, and it's said to be haunted both by Thrane ghosts and by undead forces left behind by the Karrns.": "沙杜卡（Shadukar）是对战争代价的严峻提醒。这座沿海城市曾经被称为 \"海湾的宝石\"，在一次对卡尔纳提军队的痛苦围攻中被摧毁。这座城市尚未被收回，据说它被瑟兰的鬼魂和卡恩人留下的亡灵力量所困扰。",
	"An ancient Aundairian city seized during the Last War, Thaliost was ceded to Thrane under the Treaty of Thronehold. Many of its people bitterly oppose the Thrane occupation, but it's also become a haven for Aundairian followers of the extremist Pure Flame sect; violence often breaks out between these two factions.": "Thaliost是一座古老的Aundairian城市，在最后一次战争中被夺取，根据Thronehold条约被割让给Thrane。它的许多人激烈地反对瑟兰的占领，但它也成为了极端主义的纯正火焰教派的昂代尔追随者的天堂；这两个派别之间经常爆发暴力冲突。",
	"The war is over, but deep rifts remain between Thrane and its neighbors. Aundairian war magic created a blasted wasteland between the two nations. To the east, the conflict with Karrnath left farms and cities such as Shadukar devastated and abandoned, home only to the lingering undead left behind after the Karrnathi retreat.": "战争结束了，但瑟兰和它的邻国之间仍然有很深的裂痕。昂代尔的战争魔法在两个国家之间创造了一片被炸毁的荒地。在东部，与卡尔纳特的冲突使沙杜卡等农场和城市遭到破坏和遗弃，只剩下卡尔纳特人撤退后留下的残余亡灵的家园。",
	"For most, these grim reminders of war strengthen Thrane resolve. The common people are united by their faith and sure of the righteousness of their cause. The Silver Flame urges people to stand together in the face of evil, and across the nation, villagers work together to repair the damage inflicted during the war. People in a Thrane village regularly cooperate to raise a barn or practice archery in the fields.": "对大多数人来说，这些关于战争的严峻提醒加强了瑟兰的决心。普通人因为他们的信仰而团结起来，确信他们的事业是正义的。银色的火焰敦促人们在面对邪恶时团结一致，在全国范围内，村民们一起努力修复战争期间造成的损失。瑟兰村的人们经常合作饲养谷仓或在田间练习射箭。",
	"The Silver Flame urges its followers to feel compassion for all people, which often proves a more difficult challenge. Thrane has never forgiven Karrnath for its use of undead soldiers, and many Thranes are quick to imagine all Karrns as agents of darkness. Likewise, Thranes have bitter memories of the conflict with Aundair, and Aundairian wizards or eldritch knights receive a cold reception.": "银色火焰敦促其追随者对所有的人产生同情心，这往往被证明是一个更困难的挑战。瑟兰从未原谅卡尔纳特对亡灵士兵的使用，许多瑟兰人很快就把所有卡尔纳特想象成黑暗的代理人。同样地，瑟兰人对与昂代尔的冲突有着痛苦的回忆，昂代尔的巫师或长生骑士受到冷遇。",
	"For most Thranes, the war strengthened their faith and drew them together. However, some question the validity of theocratic rule. Such doubt can be found even among the most devout followers of the faith; such people fear that the merging of temporal and spiritual authority distracts the church from its proper mission. If these doubts spread, a serious faction might seek to restore Queen Diani to power.": "对大多数瑟兰人来说，这场战争加强了他们的信仰，并使他们团结在一起。然而，有些人质疑神权统治的有效性。这种怀疑甚至可以在最虔诚的信仰追随者中找到；这些人担心世俗和精神权力的合并会使教会偏离其应有的使命。如果这些怀疑蔓延开来，一个严重的派别可能会寻求恢复迪亚尼女王的权力。",
	"Thaliost is another open wound. The Council of Cardinals is determined to hold onto this prize, but it is a bitter point of contention with Aundair and a constant source of tension and violence. In creating a Thrane character, consider how you feel about Thaliost. Would you like to see it returned to Aundair, or do you support Thrane's rule?": "Thaliost是另一个开放的伤口。红衣主教会议决心守住这个奖赏，但它是与昂代尔争论的一个痛苦点，是紧张和暴力的持续来源。在创造一个瑟兰角色时，考虑一下你对塔利奥斯特的感受。你希望看到它回到昂代尔手中，还是支持瑟兰的统治？",
	"After forging a united kingdom, Galifar I realized early on that the crown could not rule from one of the existing realms. To do so would be to put one of the Five Nations above the others, and that would lead to breaks and fractures that would eventually destroy the kingdom. Thus, he established his seat of power on an island in Scions Sound. There he built the great castle of Thronehold.": "在建立了一个统一的王国之后，加利法尔一世很早就意识到，王室不能从现有的某个王国中进行统治。这样做将使五国中的一个国家凌驾于其他国家之上，而这将导致分裂和断裂，最终摧毁王国。因此，他在西恩斯湾的一个小岛上建立了他的权力所在地。他在那里建造了伟大的王座城堡。",
	"After Jarot's death and the rejection of the line of succession that led to the Last War, the island and castle were largely abandoned. A special detachment of House Deneith guards, the Throne Wardens, remained in place to protect the castle, but all government functions ceased with the collapse of the Kingdom of Galifar.": "在雅罗特死亡和导致最后战争的继承权被否决后，该岛和城堡基本上被遗弃了。Deneith家族的一支特殊守卫分队，即王座守护者，仍在保护城堡，但随着加利法尔王国的瓦解，所有的政府职能都停止了。",
	"Throneport, a town in the shadow of the castle, became a place for dissidents, criminals, spies, and mercenaries, and the once safe port turned into a rough-and-tumble town without allegiance to any single nation.": "城堡阴影下的镇子Throneport成为持不同政见者、罪犯、间谍和雇佣兵的地方，这个曾经安全的港口变成了一个不效忠于任何一个国家的粗暴小镇。",

	"{@b Play It Again}. If diplomats and spies have one thing in common, it's a weakness for pleasant distractions. When not playing their games of deceit, they seek out the best entertainment and companionship the island has to offer. Characters with the entertainer background can make many untrustworthy friends here.": "{@b Play It Again}. 如果说外交官和间谍有一个共同点，那就是对愉快的分心的弱点。当不玩他们的欺骗游戏时，他们会寻找岛上所能提供的最好的娱乐和伴侣关系。具有艺人背景的人物可以在这里交到许多不值得信赖的朋友。",
	"By 975 YK, Throneport had grown into a small city in which all of the nations and dragonmarked houses had at least a small presence, turning it into a hotbed of international intrigue. The Treaty of Thronehold further solidified Throneport as a multinational capital under the control of small peacekeeping forces from Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, and Thrane, with House Deneith Throne Wardens in place to make sure the terms of the treaty are honored. Today, the small city is neutral ground, but the castle and its grounds remain off limits and under the watchful protection of the wardens.": "到了975年，创世港已经发展成为一个小城市，所有的国家和龙纹家族都至少有一个小的存在，把它变成了一个国际阴谋的温床。瑟恩霍德条约》进一步巩固了瑟恩港作为多国首都的地位，它由来自昂代尔、布雷兰德、卡尔纳特和瑟恩的小型维和部队控制，迪尼斯家族的王座守护者则负责确保条约的条款得到遵守。今天，这座小城市是中立地，但城堡及其场地仍然是禁区，并处于看守人的保护之下。",
	"In the midst of the Last War, an army of Tairnadal warrior elves from Aerenal seized this region from Cyre, invoking a claim to the land from long before humanity's arrival on the continent. The elves of Valenar devote themselves to the arts of war. Their cavalry has no equal in Khorvaire, and they combine a talent for magic with stealth and swordplay. Cyre employed the Valenar as mercenaries until the elves betrayed Cyre and took a corner of the nation for themselves. These lands escaped the destruction visited upon the rest of Cyre. After the Mourning, no one wanted to challenge the Valenar's claim to the land they had taken; in the interests of peace, the Treaty of Thronehold recognized the new elf kingdom of Valenar.": "在最后一次战争中，一支来自艾瑞纳尔的泰尔纳达尔精灵战士军队从赛尔手中夺取了这一地区，引用了人类到达大陆之前很久的对这块土地的要求。瓦勒纳尔的精灵们致力于战争的艺术。他们的骑兵在Khorvaire无人能及，他们将魔法的天赋与隐身术和剑术结合起来。赛尔雇用瓦勒纳人作为雇佣兵，直到精灵们背叛了赛尔，将国家的一个角落据为己有。这些土地躲过了对赛尔其他地区的破坏。哀悼之后，没有人愿意挑战瓦勒纳人对他们所夺取的土地的要求；为了和平，《王座条约》承认了瓦勒纳这个新的精灵王国。",
	"Valenar elves spend little time at rest, operating in small units called warbands. Those who aren't patrolling the kingdom travel abroad seeking adventure. Half-elves handle the civic administration. Some of these are the children of Valenar elves, but most are immigrants who've come from elsewhere in Khorvaire in search of opportunity. Cyran humans still occupying the region fall below them in rank. Once citizens of Cyre, now they're citizens of Valenar. Little has changed for the commoners, most of whom don't care who wears the crown.": "瓦伦纳精灵很少花时间休息，他们在被称为战队的小单位中行动。那些不在王国里巡逻的人则到国外寻求冒险。半精灵处理公民管理事务。其中一些是瓦莱纳精灵的孩子，但大多数是来自霍尔韦尔其他地方的移民，他们来寻找机会。仍然占据该地区的锡兰人在等级上低于他们。他们曾经是赛尔的公民，现在是瓦莱纳的公民。对平民来说，几乎没有什么变化，他们中的大多数人并不关心谁戴上了王冠。",
	"The harsh sands of the Blade Desert cover northern Valenar and serve as a natural barrier between this land and the rest of Khorvaire.

The elves won't interfere with peaceful caravans, but a well-armed group of travelers invites challenges.": "刀锋沙漠的严酷沙地覆盖了瓦勒纳北部，成为这片土地与霍尔韦尔其他地区之间的天然屏障。在沙漠之外，瓦勒纳从连绵的大草原过渡到肥沃的平原。沙漠可能是致命的，但瓦伦纳的精灵对冒险者构成了最大的风险。精灵们不会干涉和平的商队，但一群装备精良的旅行者会带来挑战。",

High King Shaeras Vadallia has promised to rein in his warriors, but many believe that the elves will continue their provocation. Their main interest is conflict with a worthy foe—and they might want Darguun or Karrnath to declare war.": "在泰尔-瓦莱斯塔斯有一句流行语：\"战争的阴影长期笼罩着瓦莱纳。\" 战争决定了瓦勒纳文化。王座条约》承认瓦勒纳是一个主权国家，但精灵们已经在挑战条约的极限。一些人冒险进入穆尔兰（Mournland）或卡巴拉（Q'barra）桀骜不驯的丛林，瓦伦纳人的战队已经向达尔古恩（Darguun）和卡尔纳特（Karrnath）发动了袭击。大王沙拉斯-瓦达利亚已承诺控制他的战士，但许多人认为，精灵们将继续他们的挑衅。他们的主要利益是与一个有价值的敌人发生冲突--而且他们可能希望达尔古恩或卡尔纳特宣战。",
	"Because of this, the nation remains on a war footing. Villages find it challenging to produce the supplies required to maintain the elf army. Still, the Valenar are rarely cruel overlords. As long as a village can meet its quotas, the elves leave it alone, though villages that fall below expectations are more likely to receive assistance from druidic advisors than punishment.": "正因为如此，这个国家仍然处于战争状态。村庄发现要生产维持精灵军队所需的物资是个挑战。不过，瓦勒纳人很少是残忍的霸主。只要一个村庄能够满足其配额，精灵们就不会管它，尽管那些低于预期的村庄更有可能得到德鲁伊顾问的帮助而不是惩罚。",

	"The gnomes of Zilargo place a high value on appearances. They design beauty into their architecture, featuring delicate carvings, elaborate railings and balconies, and lavish gardens.

The Zil have a talent for illusion and for binding elementals, and they incorporate both of these forms of magic into everyday life.": "Zilargo的地精们非常重视外表。他们在建筑中设计美感，有精致的雕刻，精心设计的栏杆和阳台，以及豪华的花园。每个社区都有壁画和雕像散落在各处。大多数装置和建筑是为身材矮小的人设计的，但也有为高大的人建造的建筑。齐尔人有幻觉和束缚元素的天赋，他们将这两种形式的魔法融入日常生活中。",

This fact dictates the primary mission of the Church of the Silver Flame: to stand ready to defend the innocent from such unnatural threats. Because the demiplanes connect to the world at random, you never know what you might find when you venture into the depths. A newly opened chasm in the sewers could be an entirely mundane hole in the ground, or it could be a passage to the Abyssal Forests of Khar.": "这些联系以多种方式影响世界。黑暗势力可以在世界的任何地方兴起，从以前未知的门户迸发到开伯尔。这一事实决定了银焰教会的主要任务：随时准备保护无辜者免受这种非自然的威胁。由于半平面与世界的连接是随机的，你永远不知道当你冒险进入深处时会发现什么。下水道中新打开的裂缝可能是一个完全平凡的地洞，也可能是通往卡尔深渊森林的通道。",
	"The many layers of Khyber share similarity only in their strangeness and deadliness. Eberron is the natural world; Khyber is the source of fiends and monstrosities and the domain of the alien daelkyr. Some cults of the Dragon Below believe that paradise awaits them in the Vale of the Inner Sun, but such cultists also consider gibbering mouthers and mind flayers to be creatures of beauty. Wondrous treasures might wait in the worlds below amid hordes of demons and aberrations.": "开伯尔的许多层都有相似之处，只是它们的怪异和致命性。Eberron是自然界；Khyber是恶魔和怪兽的源头，也是外来的daelkyr的领域。一些 \"地下龙 \"的崇拜者相信，天堂在内太阳谷等待着他们，但这些崇拜者也认为胡言乱语的人和思想混乱者是美丽的生物。在成群结队的恶魔和反常者中，奇妙的宝藏可能在下面的世界等待着。",

	"Khyber is an ever-present threat. Any deep passage could connect to a realm of fiends or spew out an army of aberrations. Despite the magnitude of this threat, portals to Khyber are very rare, and they are stable once found. If you dig a hole in the ground, the odds that you'll eventually reach the Vale of the Inner Sun are infinitesimal. And if a portal to Khyber existed in the sewers of Fairhaven, odds are good that it would already have been discovered. The risk arises when you're exploring passages where no one has gone before. The sewers of Fairhaven might be safe today, but if an earthquake opens a new shaft or a group of cultists digs deeper, a previously unknown passage to Khyber could be uncovered. Wherever a passage to Khyber appears, monsters and dark powers can rise up to threaten the world above.": "开伯尔是一个无处不在的威胁。任何深层通道都可能连接到恶魔的领域或喷出畸形人的军队。尽管这种威胁很大，但通往开伯尔的门户却非常罕见，而且一旦找到就很稳定。如果你在地上挖一个洞，最终到达内太阳谷的几率是无限小的。如果费尔哈文的下水道里有一个通往开伯尔的入口，那么很有可能它已经被发现了。当你探索以前没有人去过的通道时，风险就会出现。今天费尔哈文的下水道可能是安全的，但如果地震打开了一个新的竖井，或者一群邪教徒挖得更深，一个以前未知的通往开伯尔的通道就可能被发现。无论通往开伯尔的通道出现在哪里，怪物和黑暗势力都会崛起，威胁到上面的世界。",
	"Treasures from Khyber can take many forms. The daelkyr create living tools, including symbionts (see {@book chapter 5|ERLW|12}), but any magic item could be presented as an organic creation: a living {@item Cape of the Mountebank||cloak of the mountebank} that teleports its wearer through the plane of madness; a {@item dagger of venom} made from chitin and muscle, similar to a scorpion's barb; a {@item crystal ball} made by the daelkyr {@creature Belashyrra|ERLW} that looks like a giant eye, casting visions of distant places directly into the wielder's mind.

The city is ruled by the council of Storm Lords, who hold absolute power. As Stormreach is built on the foundations of an ancient giant city, ruins abound around and below the city. Some fear that if the city continues to expand, the growth will trigger an ancient curse. But for now, Stormreach is a prosperous community and a gateway to adventure.": "暴风城曾经是海盗和走私者的天堂，现在已经成为一个繁荣的港口，是通往Xen'drik内陆的通道。所有有龙纹的家族都在这个城市设有前哨站，这里是难民、叛徒、罪犯和其他在其他大陆没有地位的人的家。这座城市由拥有绝对权力的风暴领主议会统治。由于暴风城是建立在一个古老的巨型城市的基础上，城市周围和下面有很多废墟。有些人担心，如果城市继续扩张，其增长将触发一个古老的诅咒。但现在，Stormreach是一个繁荣的社区，是通往冒险的大门。",

	"The tremendous diversity of the people of Xen'drik means that no single trait defines objects and artifacts from this land. The primitive drow make armor comparable to studded leather using the chitin of giant scorpions. Rumors abound of more advanced drow civilizations in the layers of Khyber that lie beneath Xen'drik. The elves lived and fought in Xen'drik before the exodus that took them to Aerenal, and elven artifacts remain scattered across the region. And the grandest treasures include the work of the giants—which can often be difficult to use because of their size. The spellbook of a giant wizard might hold priceless secrets, but the bulky tome can be quite awkward for smaller folk.": "Xen'drik人的巨大多样性意味着没有一个单一的特征可以定义这片土地上的物品和工艺品。原始的乌鸦人用巨蝎的甲壳素制作出堪比钉子皮的盔甲。在Xen'drik下面的Khyber层，有很多关于更先进的乌鸦文明的传言。精灵们在出走到阿伦纳尔之前，曾在Xen'drik生活和战斗过，精灵的文物仍然散落在这个地区。而最宏伟的宝藏包括巨人的作品--由于他们的体型，这些作品往往难以使用。巨人巫师的法术书可能蕴含着无价的秘密，但笨重的书本对小个子来说可能相当笨拙。",

	"Formal prayers to the Sovereigns usually involve song. Specific songs invoke each Sovereign and seek their favor, appreciate the blessings received, and recognize the presence of a Sovereign.

	"The Dark Six are the shadows of the Sovereign Host. These dark gods shape the world and are present at all times, speaking to those willing to hear them. Where the Sovereigns govern positive forces, the Dark Six are the source of fears. Arawai and Balinor reflect the positive aspects of nature. The devastating storm, the earthquake, the wildfire? These are the work of the Devourer.": "黑暗六神是主宰者的影子。这些黑暗之神塑造了这个世界，并随时存在，对那些愿意听他们说话的人说话。主宰者掌管着积极的力量，而黑暗六神则是恐惧的来源。阿拉威和巴里诺反映了自然界的积极方面。毁灭性的风暴、地震、野火？这些都是吞噬者的工作。",
	"The Vassals of the Sovereign Host have long condemned the Dark Six as forces of evil.

	"Most of you know of the Restful Watch, the priests who tend Vassal cemeteries. What you may not know is that the priests of the Watch honor both Aureon and the Keeper!

	"Worse still is the Three Faces of War, a cult that worships the Sovereigns of War—including the Mockery, whom they call Dol Azur. Followers of this foul faith say that the battlefield holds a place for all of these gods, explicitly embracing a deity they acknowledge as the patron of treachery and terror! This cult apparently began in the Karrnathi military but spread across the Five Nations during the Last War.

	"The Dark Six and the Sovereign Host are opposite sides of the same coin. If you believe in one, you acknowledge the existence of the other.

An assassin walks the path of the Mockery, while a warlock's pact may be a gift of the Shadow.": "黑暗六人组和主宰者是同一枚硬币的两面。如果你相信一个，你就承认另一个的存在。唯一的问题是，你是害怕六神还是敬畏他们。那些选择追随这些阴险的神灵的人都会拥抱黑暗。野蛮人可能会感谢 \"愤怒 \"的礼物。一个刺客走的是嘲讽之路，而一个术士的契约可能是阴影的礼物。",
	"The Dark Six inspire worship in different ways among diverse cultures. Temples to the Dark Six appear in Droaam, along with wild revels driven by the Fury.

	"{@b The Shadow} is the dark side of knowledge and ambition. It's said to be Aureon's shadow, given malign life when Aureon mastered magic. The Shadow is the maker of monsters and the keeper of forbidden secrets, and it offers malevolent spells to warlocks and wizards.": "{@b The Shadow}是知识和野心的黑暗面。据说它是奥瑞恩的影子，在奥瑞恩掌握魔法时被赋予恶毒的生命。影子是怪物的制造者和禁忌秘密的守护者，它为术士和巫师提供恶毒的法术。",

As Keeper of the Flame, she wields tremendous divine power; she has summoned angels to her side and resurrected Cardinal Halidor after his assassination.": "瑟兰国在993年震惊了世界，它任命一个六岁的孩子为银色火焰的守护者，这是教会的最高领导职位。现在11岁了，杰拉-达兰继续让所有遇到她的人感到震惊。她拥有超越其年龄的风度和智慧，她表现出勇气和同情心的融合，这是信仰的基石。作为火焰的守护者，她拥有巨大的神力；她曾召唤天使到她身边，并在红衣主教哈利多被暗杀后使他复活。",
	"But some claim that these stories are fabrications and that Jaela is merely a figurehead for High Cardinal Krozen. The reclusive Krozen is a brilliant strategist and ruthless leader. Many believe that Krozen was behind the death of Keeper Tagor in 992 YK, suggesting that he supported the child Keeper to solidify his own influence. Is Krozen the true power behind the Flame?": "但有人声称，这些故事都是捏造的，杰拉只是大红衣主教克里夫的一个形象代言人。隐居的克罗夫是一位出色的战略家和无情的领导者。许多人认为，克里夫是992年塔戈尔守护者之死的幕后黑手，这表明他支持儿童守护者以巩固自己的影响力。克罗伊夫是烈焰背后的真正力量吗？",
	"A pillar of argent fire marks the point of Tira's sacrifice, the center of the modern church. This pillar, located in Flamekeep, is a manifestation of the Silver Flame, not the source of its power.": "一根银色的火柱标志着提拉的牺牲点，即现代教堂的中心。这根柱子位于Flamekeep，是银色火焰的一种表现形式，而不是其力量的来源。",
	"The church's templars stand ready to protect the innocent from supernatural threats, battling undead, fiends, and aberrations. Friars and ministers fight evil by doing good, performing acts of compassion and charity across Khorvaire. In contrast to the Sovereign Host, the church maintains a defined structure and creed. Archbishops monitor regions; cardinals lead the church; and the ultimate authority is the Keeper of the Flame, who maintains the font in Flamekeep and communes with Tira Miron.": "教会的圣殿骑士随时准备保护无辜者免受超自然的威胁，与亡灵、恶魔和反常者战斗。修士和牧师们通过行善来对抗邪恶，在整个霍尔韦尔进行慈悲和慈善活动。与君主教会相比，该教会保持着明确的结构和信条。大主教监督各地区；红衣主教领导教会；而最终的权威是火焰守护者，他维护着火焰守护的字体，并与提拉-米隆交流。",
	"The Last War had a serious impact on the church. Leaders still respected the Keeper's authority over spiritual matters, but the war wasn't about good or evil. Templars of all nations still joined together to fight demons, but if no supernatural threat was present, they fought for their own nations. This division allowed cracks to form in the foundation. In Breland, some priests fell prey to greed or forged ties to criminal organizations. In Aundair, a zealous faction known as the Pure Flame advocates using violence rather than compassion as the primary tool for rooting out evil. And in Thrane, the church has become the ruling body. While still driven by Tira's principles of redemption and sacrifice, the intrusion of politics means that some come to the faith seeking power rather than purely to do good.": "最后的战争对教会产生了严重的影响。领导人仍然尊重守护者在精神事务上的权威，但战争并不是关于善或恶。所有国家的圣殿骑士仍然联合起来与恶魔作战，但如果没有超自然的威胁，他们就为自己的国家而战。这种分裂使基础形成了裂缝。在布雷兰，一些牧师因贪婪而堕落，或与犯罪组织建立了联系。在昂代尔，一个被称为 \"纯净之火 \"的狂热派别主张以暴力而非同情心作为根除邪恶的主要工具。而在瑟兰，教会已经成为统治机构。虽然仍然受到提拉的救赎和牺牲原则的驱使，但政治的侵入意味着一些人来到信仰中寻求权力，而不是纯粹为了行善。",
	"In creating a follower of the Silver Flame, decide whether you are bound to the church or simply inspired by its principles. As a paladin, are you part of the templar order, or were you a farmer called to action by the Voice of the Silver Flame?": "在创建银色火焰的追随者时，决定你是受教会的约束，还是仅仅受到教会原则的启发。作为一名圣骑士，你是圣殿骑士团的一员，还是被银色火焰之声召唤而行动的农夫？",
	"The Silver Flame is centered in Thrane, but it has a strong presence in Breland and Aundair, and followers across Khorvaire. Members of the Pure Flame sect treat some species—notably shifters and changelings—with suspicion, but the faith holds that people of all races should stand together.": "银色火焰以瑟兰为中心，但它在布雷兰和昂代尔也有很强的影响力，其追随者遍布霍尔韦尔。纯洁火焰教派的成员对某些物种--尤其是变身者和变异者--持怀疑态度，但该信仰认为所有种族的人都应该站在一起。",
	"The faith's symbol is a stylized flame inlaid with silver. A silver arrowhead etched with the symbol serves as a common token, worn as a necklace.": "该信仰的标志是一个镶嵌着银色的火焰造型。一个刻有该符号的银质箭头作为普通信物，作为项链佩戴。",
	"The Silver Flame has no need of prayers or offerings; instead, services focus on the parishioners, encouraging virtuous behavior. Church hierarchy is strictly observed, and only ordained priests can perform services.": "银色火焰不需要祈祷或祭品；相反，服务的重点是教友，鼓励良性行为。教会的等级制度被严格遵守，只有被任命的牧师才能进行服务。",
	"Archery is a devotional practice of the Silver Flame, used both as a means of meditation and a martial art. Communities devoted to the Flame engage in archery training, and villages have militias of peasant archers.": "射箭是银色火焰的一种虔诚的做法，既是一种冥想的手段，也是一种武术。献身于银色火焰的社区从事射箭训练，而村庄则有农民弓箭手的民兵队伍。",
	"Fortresses of the Silver Flame are designed to serve as templar garrisons and to provide sanctuary against supernatural threats. Churches feature enormous arches and open spaces. The sanctuary of a Flamic church has a mosaic floor with a flame burning at its center.": "银色火焰的堡垒被设计为圣殿骑士的驻扎地，并为抵御超自然的威胁提供庇护。教堂具有巨大的拱门和开放的空间。弗拉米克教堂的圣殿有一个马赛克地板，其中心有一团火焰在燃烧。",
	"The seat of the religion is the Grand Cathedral in Flamekeep. Built around the site of Tira's sacrifice, this fortified temple is the size of a small city.": "该宗教的所在地是弗拉米普的大教堂。这座坚固的寺庙围绕着提拉的祭祀地点而建，规模相当于一个小城市。",
	"Everyone has a spark of divinity. Find that power within.": "每个人都有神性的火花。找到内心的那份力量。",
	"Death is the end, Dolurrh is oblivion, and if the gods exist, they are cruel. Stand with those you care for; all we have is this life and each other.": "死亡是结束，Dolurrh是遗忘，如果诸神存在，他们是残酷的。与你所关心的人站在一起；我们所拥有的就是这个生命和彼此。",
	"Last month, the Emerald Claw took credit for the ghoul outbreak in Wroat. This terrorist organization has a new and unusual critic: Hask Malevanor, an \"abactor\" of the Blood of Vol and high priest of the Crimson Monastery, a temple in the city of Atur in Karrnath. Something else you should know about Abactor Malevanor: he's been dead for over fifty years! This putrid priest says that there's nothing unholy about his condition, swearing that his people revere all life. Despite the fact that the terrorists included priests from his church, Malevanor insists that his parishioners despise the Emerald Claw and harbor no hostility toward Breland.": "上个月，翡翠之爪为沃罗特的食尸鬼爆发立下汗马功劳。这个恐怖组织有一个新的不寻常的批评者：哈斯克-马勒瓦诺（Hask Malevanor），他是沃尔之血的 \"守护者\"，也是深红修道院（位于卡尔纳特的阿图尔市）的大祭司。关于Abactor Malevanor，你还应该知道一些事情：他已经死了50多年了！这个腐朽的牧师说，有一个人在他身边。这个腐朽的牧师说，他的状况没有任何不神圣的地方，他发誓他的人民崇尚所有的生命。尽管恐怖分子中包括他的教会的牧师，但马勒瓦诺坚持说他的教友们鄙视翡翠之爪，对布雷兰德没有敌意。",
	"While we'd like to take the abactor at his word, our research shows that Malevanor was personally involved in the program that produced the infamous Karrnathi undead soldiers. After decades of driving the Karrnathi war effort, this foul creature expects us to believe that he has nothing to do with the necromantic attacks on our people? Here at the {@i Voice of Breland}, we think something about this smells rotten, and it's not just the mummy.": "虽然我们愿意相信这位检察官的话，但我们的研究表明，马勒瓦诺亲自参与了生产臭名昭著的卡尔纳提亡灵士兵的计划。在推动卡尔纳提的战争努力数十年后，这个肮脏的生物希望我们相信他与对我们的人进行的亡灵攻击无关？在{@i Voice of Breland}这里，我们认为这件事有一些腐烂的味道，而且不只是木乃伊。",
	"What just god would allow death and suffering? The Blood of Vol teaches that we all have the potential to become divine beings—and that death is a curse, designed to kill you before you can unlock the divinity within you.": "什么公正的神会允许死亡和痛苦？沃尔之血》告诉我们，我们都有成为神性生命的潜力--而死亡是一种诅咒，目的是在你能够释放你内心的神性之前杀死你。",
	"The Blood of Vol is a grim faith, founded by Erandis d'Vol, an elf from Aerenal. It asserts that death is oblivion, that the universe is uncaring, and that if the Sovereigns exist, they are cruel. Its followers study the secrets of blood and life, and because they believe that death is the end, they see nothing wrong with using the bodies of the fallen to serve the living. Seekers of the Divinity Within (as the faithful call themselves) are glad to be reanimated after death; at least they can do some good.": "沃尔之血是一种严峻的信仰，由艾瑞纳尔的精灵埃兰迪斯-多尔（Erandis d'Vol）创立。它宣称死亡就是遗忘，宇宙是无情的，如果主权者存在，他们也是残忍的。它的追随者研究血液和生命的秘密，因为他们相信死亡就是结束，所以他们认为利用堕落者的身体来为活人服务没有错。内在神性的探索者（信徒自称）很高兴在死后被复活；至少他们可以做一些好事。",
	"Because of this association with necromancy, many believe the Blood of Vol embraces death and its followers want to become undead. Both ideas are false. The Blood of Vol sees death as the ultimate evil. Seekers don't want to become undead; they want to become divine beings. The faith teaches that divinity is tied to blood and soul, and the undead can never fully harness that power. The mummies and vampires of the Blood of Vol have sacrificed their chance at divinity to guide the living. They're martyrs, not something to envy.": "由于与死灵法术的联系，许多人认为沃尔之血拥抱死亡，其追随者希望成为不死之身。这两种想法都是错误的。沃尔之血认为死亡是终极邪恶。寻求者并不想成为不死之身；他们想成为神性的存在。该信仰教导人们，神性与血液和灵魂息息相关，而亡灵永远无法完全驾驭这种力量。沃尔之血的木乃伊和吸血鬼已经牺牲了他们获得神性的机会来引导活人。他们是殉道者，不值得羡慕。",
	"In addition to a general revulsion toward the undead, the public opinion of the Blood of Vol is colored by the actions of the Order of the Emerald Claw. This extremist sect serves a lich known as the Queen of Death, and it employs necromantic magic in acts of terror. However, most Seekers don't support the Emerald Claw.": "除了对亡灵的普遍反感之外，公众对沃尔之血的看法也因翡翠之爪骑士团的行为而变得丰富多彩。这个极端教派为一个被称为死亡女王的巫师服务，并在恐怖行动中使用亡灵魔法。然而，大多数探索者并不支持绿宝石之爪。",
	"The Blood of Vol has its strongest following in Karrnath and the Lhazaar Principalities. For a time, it was the national religion of Karrnath. Though fallen from favor, the faith is still practiced openly in that nation.": "沃尔之血在卡尔纳特和拉扎尔公国拥有最强大的追随者。有一段时间，它是卡尔纳特的国教。虽然已经失宠，但该信仰在该国仍被公开奉行。",
	"The power of a cleric of the Blood of Vol comes from within them. As such, every cleric chooses a unique holy symbol—an object that resonates with them. More generally, the faith is represented by a tear-shaped red gemstone or shard of glass. Priests of the Blood of Vol wear robes of red and black.": "沃尔之血教士的力量来自于他们的内心。因此，每个教士都会选择一个独特的神圣符号--一个能与他们产生共鸣的物体。一般来说，信仰的代表是一颗眼泪状的红色宝石或玻璃碎片。沃尔之血的牧师穿着红色和黑色的长袍。",
	"The services of the Blood of Vol focus on drawing the faithful together as a community and encouraging people to find power within themselves. The most important ritual of the faith is the Sacrament of Blood. After a sermon, each member of the congregation sheds a small amount of blood into a basin. This is a symbol of unity, and a message that members of the community would shed their blood to defend one another. In some temples, this blood is donated to vampire champions of the faith.": "沃尔之血的仪式主要是把信徒们作为一个群体吸引到一起，鼓励人们在自己的内心找到力量。该信仰最重要的仪式是血的圣事。讲道结束后，每个教徒都会将少量的血流到一个盆里。这是团结的象征，也是社会成员为保护彼此而流下鲜血的信息。在一些寺庙中，这些血被捐献给信仰的吸血鬼冠军。",
	"A shrine devoted to the Blood of Vol requires only an altar and a means for collecting ritually spilled blood.": "献给沃尔之血的神龛只需要一个祭坛和收集仪式上洒下的血的方法。",
	"Temples of the Blood of Vol are fortified structures, built to serve as sanctuaries. In contrast to the Silver Flame, such temples are stark and functional. Temples include vaults or catacombs, designed to hold undead or to store corpses.": "沃尔之血的寺庙是强化的结构，是为了作为圣地而建造的。与银色火焰不同的是，这种寺庙是呆板而实用的。寺庙包括拱顶或地下墓穴，旨在容纳亡灵或储存尸体。",
	"A paradise exists within the world, a vale bathed in the light of the Inner Sun. Earn your passage with the blood of worthy foes.": "在这个世界上存在着一个天堂，一个沐浴在内在太阳之光下的谷地。用有价值的敌人的鲜血赢得你的通行证。",
	"Our existence is a chrysalis state, preparing us for transcendent immortality within the bowels of the gibbering mouther.": "我们的存在是一种蛹的状态，为我们在胡言乱语的嘴里获得超然的不朽做准备。",

	"The people of Fairhaven were shocked by the revelation of bizarre cult activity in the center of one of that city's most trusted institutions. Acting on a tip from the Royal Eyes of Aundair, elite forces raided a House Vadalis facility and discovered a nightmare. Captain Allis says that her soldiers discovered a beating heart that filled an entire room, pumping blood through veins in the walls of the building. According to Allis, the staff claimed to be \"creating the heart of Galifar,\" apparently believing that if completed, this monstrosity could reunite the shattered kingdom.": "费尔黑文市的人们被该市最值得信赖的机构之一的中心的怪异邪教活动的启示所震惊。根据昂代尔皇家之眼提供的线索，精英部队突袭了瓦达里斯家族的一个设施，发现了一场噩梦。艾利斯上尉说，她的士兵发现了一颗跳动的心脏，它充满了整个房间，通过建筑物墙壁上的静脉泵送血液。据艾利斯说，工作人员声称正在 \"创造加利法尔的心脏\"，显然认为如果完成了，这个怪胎可以让这个破碎的王国重新团结起来。",
	"When pressed to comment, Patriarch Dalin d'Vadalis denied any connections to this cult. \"These are difficult times for all of us. I assure you that House Vadalis will conduct a full investigation of this incident and work to regain the trust of the good people of Fairhaven.\"": "当被要求发表评论时，牧首Dalin d'Vadalis否认与这个邪教有任何联系。\"这对我们所有人来说都是困难时期。我向你保证，Vadalis家族将对这一事件进行全面调查，并努力重新获得费尔哈文善良人民的信任。\"",
	"The Cults of the Dragon Below are wildly diverse. The tenets above describe the beliefs of three different cults. Warlocks draw power from demon overlords, and daelkyr cultists serve mind flayers and beholders. Others embrace deep convictions that others see as madness. Outsiders use the term \"Cult of the Dragon Below\" as a blanket term to describe these disparate beliefs, but the cultists don't use this name or see themselves as part of a greater whole.": "下面的龙的邪教有很大的不同。上面的信条描述了三种不同邪教的信仰。术士们从恶魔领主那里汲取力量，而达尔凯尔（daelkyr）崇拜者则服务于心魔控制者和神明。其他人则拥护深刻的信念，而其他人则认为这是一种疯狂。外人用 \"下龙教 \"这个词来描述这些不同的信仰，但邪教成员不使用这个名字，也不把自己看作是一个更大的整体的一部分。",
	"Cults driven by madness have a warped view of reality. A cultist might believe aberrations are a higher form of life and that the daelkyr will elevate mortals. Other cultists may not recognize the true nature of the beings they serve. A cult of {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} might truly believe their lord will bring peace to the world, even if that peace must begin with bloody war. Joining such a cult isn't a choice, it's something you fall into due to madness. New cults can spring up anywhere, as seeds of madness take root and spread.": "受疯狂驱使的邪教对现实有扭曲的看法。一个邪教组织可能相信畸形人是一种更高的生命形式，并且认为daelkyr会提升凡人。其他邪教徒可能不承认他们所服务的生命的真实性质。一个{@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW}的邪教可能真的相信他们的主会给世界带来和平，即使这种和平必须以血腥的战争开始。加入这样的邪教并不是一种选择，而是你由于疯狂而陷入其中。新的邪教可以在任何地方兴起，因为疯狂的种子已经生根发芽并传播。",
	"Cults of the Dragon Below often appear as antagonists. However, your character could be a member of a relatively benign cult. You might have been raised in a cult but broke free from its influence. If your character was or is part of a cult, work with your DM to develop the details of your sect.": "下面的龙的邪教经常作为对立面出现。然而，你的角色可能是一个相对温和的邪教成员。你可能是在邪教中长大的，但摆脱了邪教的影响。如果你的角色曾经或现在是邪教的一部分，请与你的管理员合作，发展你的教派的细节。",
	"Cult rituals are intense and often violent, including blood sacrifice and ritual combat. Many cultists consume unnatural substances, seeking a closer communion to aberrations. They perform rituals in Undercommon, though most cultists don't have a full understanding of the language.": "邪教的仪式是激烈的，而且往往是暴力的，包括血祭和仪式性的战斗。许多邪教成员食用非自然物质，寻求与反常者更紧密的交流。他们用暗语进行仪式，尽管大多数邪教成员并不完全理解暗语的含义。",

	"Practiced by many kalashtar, the Path of Light seeks to change reality by first bringing change within, using meditation to focus the mind and athletic discipline to improve the body. The next step brings light into the world, using courage and compassion to banish the darkness in the people around you. Mediate disputes. Extinguish hatred by guiding people out of darkness. Inspire people to be better than they are. Even the smallest change is a victory, yet lightbringers—the followers of this path—hope that this is merely a step on a greater journey.": "光明之路是由许多卡拉什塔练习的，它首先寻求改变现实，利用冥想来集中思想，利用运动纪律来改善身体。下一步是将光明带入世界，利用勇气和同情心驱逐周围人的黑暗。调解争端。通过引导人们走出黑暗而熄灭仇恨。激励人们变得比现在更好。即使是最小的变化也是一种胜利，然而，光明使者--这条道路的追随者--希望这只是更大的旅程中的一步。",
	"The Path of Light teaches that this age is dominated by il-Lashtavar, \"the great darkness that dreams.\" This force poisons the world and promotes darkness. But all things change.

	"Some followers of this faith believe that meditation alone is sufficient to change the path of the world, that merely contemplating the light is sufficient to bring about the change. Most believe that it is necessary to take action, but that darkness must fought with light. Violence is never the answer, and the only way to defeat evil is to redeem it. Lightbringers seek to inspire those who live in fear and enlighten those whose evil is driven by ignorance. The faith has followed this path for over a thousand years, but now a splinter sect advocates greater action. These shadow watchers believe that evil must be fought, that sources of darkness that poison communities can and should be ruthlessly eliminated.": "这种信仰的一些追随者认为，仅靠冥想就足以改变世界的道路，仅仅沉思光明就足以带来改变。大多数人认为，有必要采取行动，但黑暗必须以光明来对抗。暴力从来不是答案，打败邪恶的唯一方法是救赎它。光明使者试图激励那些生活在恐惧中的人，并启迪那些因无知而导致邪恶的人。信仰沿着这条道路走了一千多年，但现在一个分裂的教派主张采取更大的行动。这些影子守望者相信，邪恶必须被打击，那些毒害社区的黑暗源头可以而且应该被无情地消除。",
	"The Path of Light is taught to the kalashtar by the spirits bound to their bloodlines.

	"Physical and mental discipline are important virtues of the Path of Light. Martial arts and guided meditation become a form of devotion and prayer.

Labyrinthine patterns engraved on the floors serve as an aid to meditation, while the walls hold crystals that focus and amplify the psychic abilities of the priests.": "萨尔罗纳的阿达尔国是致力于光明之路的巨大堡垒寺院的所在地。在霍尔韦尔，仅有的几座神殿出现在拥有大量卡拉什塔社区的城市。这些神殿平静而安详，空气中弥漫着萨洛南香的味道。殿堂是开放的，为武术提供了空间。刻在地板上的迷宫式图案是冥想的辅助工具，而墙壁上的水晶可以集中和放大祭司们的精神能力。",

When you came of age, the Keepers of the Past read the signs to determine which of these ancestors chose you to be their vessel. Since that day, it has been your duty to emulate your patron ancestor. If you're a wizard, you've studied the spells created by your ancestor. If you're a warrior, you've practiced their specific martial techniques. When you trance, you relive their greatest battles. But these studies are just preparation. Now it's your sacred duty to be a revenant of your ancestor: to live your life as they did and allow the champion to walk the world again through you. (This title of revenant carried by Speakers of the Past is not to be confused with the undead revenants described in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}.)": "作为瓦勒纳尔的泰尔纳达尔精灵，你是在你的族人的传说中长大的，在与强大的龙和巨人军队作战的冠军故事中长大的。当你成年后，过去的守护者们通过阅读标志来确定这些祖先中的哪一位选择你作为他们的容器。从那一天起，你就有责任效仿你的守护者祖先。如果你是一个巫师，你就研究你的祖先创造的法术。如果你是一个战士，你已经练习了他们特定的武术技巧。当你精神恍惚时，你会重温他们最伟大的战役。但这些研究只是准备。现在你的神圣职责是成为你祖先的复仇者：像他们那样生活，让冠军通过你再次行走在这个世界上。(这个由过去的演讲者携带的复仇者头衔不能与{@book Monster Manual|MM}中描述的亡灵复仇者相混淆)。",
	"The bond between ancestor and living elf is holy. Your ancestor doesn't speak to you or control your actions. But as a Tairnadal, you believe that they are with you—that your instincts and your reflexes are the ancestor moving through you, telling you what to do. The closer you follow the path, the more guidance they provide, helping you create new legends.": "祖先和活着的精灵之间的联系是神圣的。你的祖先不会对你说话，也不会控制你的行动。但作为一个泰尔纳达尔人，你相信他们与你同在--你的本能和你的反射是祖先在你身上移动，告诉你该怎么做。你走得越近，他们提供的指导就越多，帮助你创造新的传奇。",
	"The folk of Khorvaire see your people as mercenaries and conquerors. But you don't care about gold or personal glory. All you want is to let your ancestors live again, and that means you need to perform deeds worthy of champions. That drives you now: seeking out adventures that will add to the legends of your patron.": "霍尔韦尔的民众将你们的人视为雇佣兵和征服者。但你们并不关心黄金或个人荣誉。你所想要的是让你的祖先重新活下来，这意味着你需要完成值得冠军的事迹。这就是你现在的动力：寻找冒险，为你的守护者增添传奇色彩。",
	"You and your DM should develop the identity of your ancestor. How did they fight? What were some of their legendary deeds? Did they have a distinctive weapon or favor a particular kind of magic? Equally important is your relationship with the ancestor. Are you proud of your ancestor and excited to live as they did, or is your duty a burden?": "你和你的DM应该发展你祖先的身份。他们是如何战斗的？他们有哪些传奇性的事迹？他们是否有独特的武器或喜欢某种特殊的魔法？同样重要的是你与祖先的关系。你是否为你的祖先感到骄傲，并为能像他们那样生活而兴奋，还是你的职责是一种负担？",
	"Since the rise of Valenar, half-elves and even some humans have sought to be inducted into the faith. But so far the Keepers of the Past have declared that only elves can be revenants. Beyond the blood connection to the ancestor, an elf communes with their ancestor during trance, and half-elves can't enter this state. The Keepers say it can't be done, but perhaps you'll be the one to prove them wrong.": "自从瓦勒纳崛起以来，半精灵甚至一些人类都试图被纳入信仰。但到目前为止，过去的守护者们宣布只有精灵可以成为复仇者。除了与祖先的血缘关系外，精灵在恍惚中与他们的祖先交流，而半精灵不能进入这种状态。守护者们说这是不可能的，但也许你会成为证明他们错误的人。",
	"The primary symbol of the faith is the zaelshin, an amulet that bears the seal of your patron ancestor and worn either as a brooch or embedded in the forehead of a helmet.

The faithful spend this time in communion with their ancestor, experiencing their memories and contemplating their deeds.": "仪式围绕着祖先的故事进行，纪念他们的光荣事迹，以及仪式练习和恍惚冥想。在休息的时候，一个精灵会花四个小时的时间进行恍惚。信徒们在这段时间里与他们的祖先交流，体验他们的记忆，思考他们的事迹。",
	"The nomadic Tairnadal elves don't raise permanent temples. A Keeper of the Past marks a circle on the ground with their blade, and the space within becomes sanctified for the service.": "游牧的泰尔纳达尔精灵并不建造永久性的神庙。过去的守护者用他们的刀在地上划出一个圆圈，里面的空间就成为神圣的服务。",
	"Our greatest champions and sages will never be lost to us. Their wisdom guides us, and their power protects us all.": "我们最伟大的冠军和圣人将永远不会被我们所遗忘。他们的智慧指引着我们，他们的力量保护着我们所有人。",
	"Honor our past. Respect our traditions. Perfect your skills and you may earn your place among the Deathless.": "尊敬我们的过去。尊重我们的传统。完善你的技能，你就可以在不死族中赢得你的地位。",
	"Destroy those foul creatures that channel the power of Mabar, for they consume the essence of our world.": "摧毁那些引导马巴尔力量的肮脏生物，因为它们吞噬了我们世界的精华。",
	"The elves of Aerenal refuse to let their greatest souls be lost to the oblivion that is Dolurrh. The wisest and most accomplished elves are preserved after death, becoming members of the Undying Court. The devotion of the living elves sustains the Undying Court, and the Court generates a well of mystic energy that empowers their clerics. As an Aereni cleric, your spells aren't personally granted to you by a specific Undying Councilor. Your powers flow from the Court itself, allowing you to serve its will and to protect your people.": "Aerenal的精灵们拒绝让他们最伟大的灵魂消失在Dolurrh的遗忘中。最有智慧和最有成就的精灵在死后被保留下来，成为不死阁的成员。活着的精灵们的奉献精神支撑着不死阁，而不死阁产生了一个神秘的能量井，为他们的神职人员提供能量。作为一个Aereni教士，你的法术并不是由特定的不死阁成员亲自授予的。你的力量来自法院本身，使你能够服务于它的意志并保护你的人民。",
	"Of all the religions of Eberron, the Undying Court is most grounded in the world. The Court stands in the city of Shae Mordai, and as an Aerenal elf, you could seek an audience with one of your deathless ancestors. As a devotee of the Undying Court, you recognize it as the power that sustains your civilization and as an assembly of your greatest sages and leaders. Should you accomplish great achievements in your life, you can aspire to join the Court.": "在Eberron的所有宗教中，不死阁是最接地气的宗教。不死阁矗立在Shae Mordai城，作为一个Aerenal精灵，你可以寻求与你的不死祖先之一会面。作为不死阁的信徒，你认识到它是维持你的文明的力量，是你最伟大的圣人和领袖的集会。如果你在你的生活中取得了巨大的成就，你可以渴望加入法庭。",
	"As a cleric or paladin of the Undying Court, you have a concrete relationship with your deity. In creating your character, consider why you've traveled so far from home. Are you on a specific mission? Are you serving the Court as a whole, or are you acting as an agent of a specific councilor—perhaps your own ancestor? The Undying Court despises undead creatures that prey on the living, so if you don't have a concrete mission, you can always hunt down undead and evil necromancers.": "作为不死阁的牧师或圣骑士，你与你的神灵有一种具体的关系。在创建你的角色时，考虑你为什么要离家这么远。你是在执行一个特定的任务吗？你是在为整个不死鸟法庭服务，还是作为一个特定的理事--也许是你自己的祖先--的代理人行事？不死鸟法庭鄙视那些捕食活人的不死生物，所以如果你没有具体的任务，你可以随时猎杀不死生物和邪恶的死灵法师。",
	"The symbol of the Undying Court is a golden mask with luminous eyes, worn over the face while a priest is carrying out their duties. Devotees wear a smaller mask as a brooch or amulet.": "不死阁的象征是一个金色的面具，有发光的眼睛，在牧师执行任务时戴在脸上。虔诚的信徒会佩戴一个较小的面具作为胸针或护身符。",
	"The most sacred rite of the Undying Court is trance communion. While in trance, an Aereni elf engages in meditation that connects them to the gestalt consciousness of the Court. This experience affirms the place of the individual as part of the greater whole.": "不朽之庭最神圣的仪式是恍惚共融。在精神恍惚时，艾瑞尼精灵会进行冥想，将他们与法院的格式塔意识联系起来。这种体验肯定了个人作为大整体的一部分的地位。",
	"Since trance communion is a personal experience, the role of the priest is to provide spiritual and practical guidance to their congregation. A masked priest serves as the face of the Court, and any elf can approach them seeking an ease to their burdens.": "由于恍惚共融是一种个人体验，牧师的作用是为他们的会众提供精神和实际指导。一个戴着面具的牧师作为法庭的代言人，任何精灵都可以接近他们，寻求减轻他们的负担。",
	"In Aerenal, the temples of the Undying Court are step pyramids built from stone. In Khorvaire, shrines to the Court use imported Aereni densewood, a particularly tough lumber that grows only on the island. Regardless of form, the walls are engraved with stories about the Undying Councilors that serve as the particular patrons of the temple, usually those related to the local priests.": "在Aerenal，不死阁的神庙是用石头建造的阶梯式金字塔。在霍尔韦尔，不死鸟法庭的神殿使用进口的艾瑞尼密林，这是一种特别坚硬的木材，只在岛上生长。无论哪种形式，墙壁上都刻有作为神庙特定赞助人的不死族议员的故事，通常是与当地牧师有关的人。",
	"The alliance of rebel farmers in western Aundair has declared an alliance with the Great Druid Oalian of the Towering Wood, asserting that the farmlands that border these woods are now part of the Eldeen Reaches. The Great Druid is a figure of legend, a powerful mystic who serves as the spiritual leader of a diverse range of druids spread across the region. Another interesting fact about Oalian? He's a tree! Some say he's a child of Eberron herself, while others assert that he's the spirit of an ancient druid trapped in tree form. Whatever the truth, the Great Druid Oalian appears as a massive greatpine in a grove called Greenheart, deep in the Towering Wood.": "昂代尔西部的反叛农民联盟已经宣布与高耸森林的大德鲁伊奥里安结盟，宣称与这些森林接壤的农田现在是艾尔迪恩河谷的一部分。大德鲁伊是一个传奇人物，是一个强大的神秘主义者，是遍布该地区的各种德鲁伊的精神领袖。关于Oalian的另一个有趣的事实？他是一棵树! 有人说他是艾伯伦自己的孩子，也有人断言他是一个古代德鲁伊的灵魂，被困于树形。无论真相如何，伟大的德鲁伊-奥里安是以一棵巨大的大松树出现在高耸的森林深处一个叫绿心的小树林里。",

	"All druids look after the natural world, but they act in different ways. Five well-established paths define most of Khorvaire's druids. In creating a druid character, consider whether you have ties to one of these traditions, and what led you to leave your order. Are you on a mission? Are you exploring the world? Have you been banished, with good reason or otherwise?": "所有德鲁伊都关注自然世界，但他们的行动方式不同。五条成熟的道路定义了霍尔韦尔的大部分德鲁伊。在创建德鲁伊角色时，考虑你是否与这些传统之一有联系，以及是什么导致你离开你的秩序。你在执行任务吗？你在探索这个世界吗？你是否被放逐了，无论是否有充分的理由？",
	"The Ashbound defend the natural world from anything that threatens it. Some Ashbound consider civilization to be a threat and strike at any settlement that encroaches on the wild. Others focus their wrath on the dragonmarked houses or seek to free bound elementals.": "Ashbound人保护自然界免受任何威胁。一些灰袍人认为文明是一种威胁，并对任何侵犯野生环境的定居点进行打击。其他人则将他们的愤怒集中在有龙纹的房子上，或者寻求释放被束缚的元素。",
	"The Children of Winter believe that death and decay are vital aspects of the natural cycle of life. They believe that if the cycle falls out of balance, it will trigger a devastating cataclysm as the world resets this balance. They battle undead, but they also engage in actions that cull the weak. Extremists have been known to spread plagues in cities. The Children of Winter are particularly interested in unraveling the mystery of the Mourning, as some of them believe it is a sign of the apocalypse they fear.": "冬之子相信，死亡和腐烂是生命自然循环的重要方面。他们相信，如果这个循环失去了平衡，就会引发一场毁灭性的大灾难，因为世界会恢复这种平衡。他们与亡灵作战，但他们也参与了清除弱者的行动。众所周知，极端分子会在城市中传播瘟疫。冬之子对解开哀伤之谜特别感兴趣，因为他们中的一些人认为这是他们所担心的世界末日的一个标志。",
	"The Gatekeepers are one of the oldest sects, primarily found among the orcs of the Shadow Marches.

The Gatekeepers maintain ancient seals that hold long-forgotten evils at bay.": "守门人是最古老的教派之一，主要在阴影地带的兽人中发现。他们保护艾伯伦不受异形和其他非自然生物的侵害，并寻求防止星外入侵和攻击。守门人维护着古老的封印，将被遗忘已久的邪恶阻挡在门外。",
	"The Greensingers are devoted to the fey, and serve as mediators between the fey and mortals. The ranks of the Greensingers include bards as well as warlocks with Archfey patrons; a druid or ranger might also serve a specific archfey.": "绿心人献身于精灵，在精灵和凡人之间充当调解人。绿衣人的队伍包括吟游诗人以及有大法师赞助的术士；德鲁伊或游侠也可能服务于某个特定的大法师。",
	"The Wardens of the Wood believe that civilization has a place in the world. As a warden, you help others understand nature, ensuring that they don't cause unintentional harm or stumble into danger. Wardens serve as militia and mediators in the Eldeen Reaches. This is the largest of the druidic sects and the most recognized.": "森林守护者相信，文明在这个世界上有一席之地。作为一名守护者，你帮助他人了解自然，确保他们不会造成无意的伤害或误入危险。典狱长在艾尔迪恩河谷充当民兵和调解员。这是德鲁伊教派中最大的教派，也是最受认可的教派。",
	"I've been here a week, and it's still hard not to feel overwhelmed by the city. The towers rise up until they disappear into the clouds. Lights gleam in a thousand windows. Skycoaches work their way through the maze of bridges connecting the towers, and up above I can see the burning ring of an elemental airship.": "我已经在这里呆了一个星期，仍然很难不被这座城市所淹没。高楼拔地而起，直到消失在云层中。一千多扇窗户上的灯光闪闪发光。空中客车在连接塔楼的迷宫般的桥梁中行驶，在上面我可以看到一个元素飞艇的燃烧环。",
	"Distracted by the sights in the sky, I nearly walk into a warforged as it brushes past me. It's my first time seeing one, but then there are so many things I've never seen in this place.

I gather my senses and keep moving.": "我被天空中的景象所吸引，当它从我身边经过时，我差点撞上了一个战神。这是我第一次看到，但在这个地方，有很多东西我都没见过。在那边，一个有纹身的精灵和一个戴面具的半身人讨价还价，为蜥蜴肉的价格争论不休。在他们身后，一个石像鬼在高处观望。我收起我的感觉，继续前进。",

	"All the major themes of Eberron are manifest in the great city of Sharn. It's a place of magic, with skycoaches circling mile-high towers and mystic forges toiling endlessly in the bowels. It's a place of adventure and intrigue. A fallen angel is gathering minions in the ruins below the city. A gang war is gaining strength in Callestan. The corpse of a murdered aristocrat has just been discovered in a floating mansion. A Cannith artificer is experimenting with a planar gateway—and something is about to go terribly wrong. All of these adventures and a hundred more are waiting in the City of Towers.": "Eberron的所有主要主题都体现在伟大的城市Sharn中。这是一个充满魔法的地方，天空之车在一英里高的塔楼上盘旋，神秘的锻造厂在地底无休止地工作。这是一个充满冒险和阴谋的地方。一个堕落的天使正在城市下面的废墟中聚集爪牙。一场帮派战争在卡利斯坦逐渐壮大。一个被谋杀的贵族的尸体刚刚在一座漂浮的豪宅中被发现。一个坎尼斯人的工匠正在试验一个平面网关--而一些事情即将发生严重的错误。所有这些冒险以及更多的冒险都在塔楼之城中等待着。",

	"Sharn is the largest city in Khorvaire, with a population of half a million people. Humans make up about a third of that number, and dwarves are a sixth of it; the rest is a blend of every race found across Khorvaire. Halflings, elves, and gnomes all have a significant presence in the city, but even kalashtar and changelings have communities in Sharn. Beyond the permanent population, tens of thousands of people pass through Sharn every day. Refugees from the war still find their way to the city, along with tourists, spies, merchants, and folk hoping to find their fortune in the grandest city in Eberron.": "沙恩是Khorvaire最大的城市，拥有50万人口。人类占了其中的三分之一，矮人占了六分之一；其余的则是在霍尔韦尔各地发现的各个种族的混合体。半身人、精灵和地精都在这个城市有很大的影响力，但即使是卡拉什塔人和变革者也在沙恩有自己的社区。除了常住人口，每天还有数以万计的人经过沙恩。从战争中逃出来的难民仍然会来到这座城市，还有游客、间谍、商人，以及希望在Eberron最宏伟的城市中找到财富的人们。",
	"Sharn stands above the Dagger River and its eastern tributary, the Hilt. It's an important port for anyone dealing with Aerenal, Xen'drik, or Sarlona. Mountains line the shores of the Dagger, and Sharn can't spread out. So instead it has grown ever upward.": "沙恩矗立在大刀河及其东部支流希尔特河之上。对于任何与Aerenal、Xen'drik或Sarlona打交道的人来说，它是一个重要的港口。匕首河岸边有很多山脉，沙恩不能向外扩张。因此，它反而不断向上发展。",
	"The city is primarily made up of these quarters:": "这座城市主要由这些街区组成。",
	"Central Plateau": "中部高原",
	"Menthis Plateau": "门斯高原",
	"Tavick's Landing": "塔维克岛",
	"At the hub of each of these quarters is a cluster of enormous core towers. A web of bridges and platforms connects many of these vast spires, and smaller turrets sprout from the edges of the core towers. The district of Skyway floats above the highest towers, while the tunnels of the Cogs stretch out below the lower city.": "在每个区的中心，都有一簇巨大的核心塔楼。一个由桥梁和平台组成的网络连接着许多这些巨大的尖塔，而较小的炮塔则从核心塔的边缘冒出来。Skyway区漂浮在最高的塔楼之上，而Cogs区的隧道则延伸到低层城市的下面。",
	"In between those extremes, each of the quarters is divided into an upper ward, a middle ward, and a lower ward. Each ward is made up of a number of districts, so that the location of a place in Sharn can be expressed with a combination of a ward name and a district name. More information about each of the wards and the districts in them appears later in this chapter.": "在这两个极端之间，每个区又分为上区、中区和下区。每个区由若干个区组成，因此，沙恩的一个地方的位置可以用区名和区名的组合来表示。关于每个区和其中的区的更多信息将在本章后面出现。",
	"Far from the front lines, Sharn never fell under siege during the Last War. Regardless, the war's impacts affected the city's citizens and continue to even today.": "远离前线，沙恩在最后一次战争中从未被围困。尽管如此，战争的影响仍然影响着城市的公民，甚至持续到今天。",
	"Although Sharn was never subjected to a sustained assault, it didn't avoid damage. On many occasions, commandos and saboteurs launched significant attacks inside Sharn. The most infamous of these was the Aundairian attack that brought down the floating Glass Tower, devastating the district now known as Fallen. In any of the lower or middle wards, you might encounter evidence of the conflict in the form of a shattered bridge, a building collapsed by an arcane explosion, or an area some say is haunted because of the large number of people killed there during the war.": "虽然沙恩从未遭受过持续的攻击，但它也没有避免损失。在许多情况下，突击队和破坏者在沙恩内部发动了重大的攻击。其中最臭名昭著的是昂代尔（Aundairian）的攻击，它使漂浮的玻璃塔倒下，破坏了现在被称为堕落的地区。在任何一个低级或中级区，你可能会遇到冲突的证据，如一座破碎的桥梁，一栋被奥术爆炸摧毁的建筑，或一个有人说是闹鬼的地方，因为战争期间有大量的人在那里被杀。",
	"There are places in the city that house people who suffered because of the actions of other nations. For example, many of the residents of Dura hold all Aundairians responsible for the destruction of Fallen. In another district, folk could hate the Karrns for an undead attack that occurred during the war, and a different group could blame Thrane for the siege of Vathirond. These kinds of sentiments can shape the feelings of an entire district, but in the city as a whole there are far more people who have personal burdens to carry than those who feel resentment toward particular nations. For instance, on an individual level, most members of the Sharn Watch might not care about a gnoll being seen in a neighborhood, but a guard who fought on the Droaam front during the war might be out for revenge. Warforged are sometimes also the targets of this sort of prejudice; a person whose friends were killed by warforged soldiers might resent all such creatures.": "城市里有一些地方住着因为其他国家的行为而受苦的人。例如，杜拉的许多居民认为所有昂代尔人都要对堕落的毁灭负责。在另一个地区，人们可能会因为战争期间发生的一次亡灵攻击而憎恨卡伦家族，而另一群人则会因为瓦西隆德的围困而指责瑟兰。这些情绪可以塑造整个地区的感情，但在整个城市中，有个人负担的人远多于对特定国家感到不满的人。例如，在个人层面上，大多数沙恩守望的成员可能并不在意一个地精在附近出现，但在战争期间在德罗阿姆前线作战的卫兵可能会去复仇。战神有时也是这种偏见的目标；一个朋友被战神士兵杀死的人可能会憎恨所有这种生物。",
	"Because the ink is barely dry on the Treaty of Thronehold and relationships between the signatories are still being normalized, Sharn doesn't currently benefit from a lot of commerce with other nations. Problems could arise from a short supply of any imported goods, whether this manifests as inflated prices, the need for rationing, or certain items being simply unavailable. The factors of supply and demand also play into smuggling and the black market; some desirable goods might be available only through the Boromar Clan.": "由于《王权条约》的墨迹尚未干透，签署方之间的关系仍在正常化，沙恩目前并没有从与其他国家的大量贸易中受益。任何进口商品的供应短缺都会产生问题，无论是表现为价格上涨、需要配给，还是某些物品根本无法获得。供应和需求的因素也会影响到走私和黑市；一些理想的商品可能只能通过波洛马氏族获得。",
	"Cyran refugees have filled the district of High Walls in Lower Tavick's Landing beyond capacity, and Sharn is also home to a significant number of refugees from elsewhere in Breland—people whose homes and villages were destroyed during the war, and who have come to Sharn in search of new lives. The city also has its share of other people harmed during the war, soldiers and civilians with severe physical or psychological injuries. All these folk are most likely to be found in the lower wards. They aren't just poor; they're suffering—and they might seek vengeance against those they blame for their pain.": "西兰的难民已经把下塔维克登陆区的高墙区塞得满满当当，沙恩也有大量来自布雷兰其他地方的难民--他们的家园和村庄在战争中被摧毁，他们来到沙恩寻找新的生活。这个城市也有其他在战争中受到伤害的人，有身体或心理上受到严重伤害的士兵和平民。所有这些人最有可能被发现在下层病房。他们不仅仅是穷人；他们在受苦--他们可能会对那些被他们指责为痛苦的人寻求报复。",
	"When you live on the inside low, you never see the sun. People hear \"towers,\" they think of graceful little spires, the sort of thing you see poking up in the corner of your lord's keep. We've got those, and lots of 'em. But the foundation of the city is the core towers. The walls of these towers are so thick you could fit your lord's castle in one.": "当你住在里面的低层时，你永远看不到太阳。人们听到 \"塔楼\"，就会想到优雅的小尖塔，就是那种你在领主的城堡角落里看到的东西。我们有那些，而且有很多。但城市的基础是核心塔楼。这些塔楼的墙壁非常厚，你可以把你的领主的城堡装在其中。",
	"You've got your outside districts where you get the open air, built on the bridges and platforms that connect the core towers together. You've got the little turrets, built on the core tower walls and the bridges between. You've got the folk in the middle, who live and work in the walls themselves. And then you've got those of us on the inside, our districts entirely contained in the hollow well of a great tower. When you look up in Callestan, you see twinkling lights, to be sure. But those aren't stars, and that isn't the sky. You're looking up through a mile of bridges and platforms crossing the well, looking up at the districts above you.": "你有你的外部区域，在那里你可以得到开放的空气，建立在连接核心塔楼的桥梁和平台上。你有小炮台，建在核心塔楼的墙壁和中间的桥梁上。你已经得到了中间的人，他们生活和工作在城墙本身。然后你有我们这些在里面的人，我们的地区完全包含在一个大塔的空心井里。当你在Callestan仰望时，你会看到闪烁的灯光，这是肯定的。但那些不是星星，那也不是天空。你是通过一英里长的桥梁和平台穿过井，抬头看你上面的地区。",
	"You live up high, you can touch the sky. In the middle you can still see the sun. Down on the inside low, all we have is gloom and the constant drip, water and worse descending from the city above us.": "你住在高处，你可以触摸到天空。在中间，你仍然可以看到太阳。在里面的低处，我们只有阴暗和不断的滴水，水和更坏的东西从我们上面的城市降下来。",
	"Sharn is the most cosmopolitan city on the continent. Describing all the activities and offerings in the city could fill an entire book. Here's a summary of what you need to know to appreciate the city to the fullest.": "沙恩是非洲大陆上最国际化的城市。描述这个城市的所有活动和产品可以写满一整本书。以下是你需要了解的内容，以充分欣赏这座城市。",
	"Just this week a Brelish woman in Middle Central was squashed to death when a drunk Cyran man fell on her from the upper wards. He survived. A good Brelish woman, a veteran of the Last War, cushioned his fall!": "就在本周，中环的一名布瑞利什妇女被压死了，因为一名喝醉酒的锡兰人从上层病房倒在她身上。他活了下来。一个好的布瑞利什女人，一个参加过最后一次战争的老兵，缓冲了他的坠落!",
	"This incident isn't the first of its kind. Last month a clumsy warforged crushed two innocent halfling lovers. Before that, a shifter thief fell from a tower, injuring an unsuspecting griffon. I propose a new law: No traveling the middle or upper wards without a feather token. These affordable trinkets are all that stand between our safety and death caused by some rat who would rather spend gold on drink.": "这起事件并不是第一次发生。上个月，一个笨拙的战争锻造者压死了两个无辜的半身人恋人。在此之前，一个变身盗贼从塔上掉下来，砸伤了一个毫无防备的狮鹫。我提议制定一项新的法律。没有羽毛令牌就不能在中区或上区旅行。在我们的安全和一些宁愿花金子喝酒的老鼠造成的死亡之间，这些实惠的饰品是唯一的屏障。",
	"As befits the City of Towers, Sharn is also a city of bridges and balconies. These thoroughfares and outcroppings can be extremely narrow or comfortably wide. Although most of them are bounded by walls or railings, there's always a chance that during your time in Sharn, you or someone you know will go over the edge. So, how do residents cope with this risk?": "与塔楼之城相称的是，沙恩也是一座桥梁和阳台的城市。这些大道和外墙可以是非常狭窄的，也可以是舒适宽阔的。虽然它们中的大多数都有墙壁或栏杆，但在沙恩的日子里，你或你认识的人总是有机会翻越边缘。那么，居民是如何应对这种风险的呢？",
	"Many different outcomes could follow a lengthy fall. The Falling in Sharn table presents a few possibilities.": "漫长的坠落之后可能会出现许多不同的结果。坠落在沙恩的表格提出了一些可能性。",
	"You fall hundreds of feet before striking the ground at the base of the towers.": "在击中塔楼底部的地面之前，你会坠落数百英尺。",
	"You fall {@dice 2d4 × 10} feet and land in a passing skycoach, possibly injuring a passenger.": "你坠落{@dice 2d4 × 10}英尺，落在一辆路过的空中客车上，可能会伤到一名乘客。",
	"You fall {@dice 4d4 × 5} feet and strike an outcropping, flagpole, or projecting statue. If you survive, you're still precariously perched on the edge of a tower or bridge.": "你坠落了{@dice 4d4 × 5}英尺，并击中了一个突出物、旗杆或突出的雕像。如果你能活下来，你仍然岌岌可危地站在塔或桥的边缘。",

	"A {@creature gargoyle} or {@creature giant owl} catches you—then threatens to drop you if it doesn't get a reward.": "一个{@creature gargoyle}或{@creature giant owl}的人抓住了你--然后威胁说如果它没有得到奖励就把你扔掉。",
	"Magewrights and adepts can be found in every district of Sharn, selling their services. Standard prices are summarized on the Magewright Casting Fees table.": "在沙恩的每一个地区都可以找到魔法师和神职人员，他们出售自己的服务。标准的价格总结在 \"魔法师铸造费用 \"表中。",
	"These costs can vary depending on the spell and the spellcaster, and they don't include the price of expensive components. People who can cast higher-level spells are rare, typically found only in the dragonmarked houses or the wizard circles; the cost and availability of such services varies based on the caster.": "这些费用会因法术和施法者的不同而不同，而且不包括昂贵部件的价格。能够施展更高级别的法术的人很罕见，通常只在有龙纹的房子或巫师圈子里才能找到；这种服务的成本和可用性根据施法者的不同而不同。",
	"In Sharn, as in any large community, different segments of the population occupy different places in the economic spectrum. The terms that D&D uses to quantify lifestyle expenses—wretched, squalid, poor, modest, comfortable, wealthy, and aristocratic (see \"{@book Expenses|PHB|5|Expenses}\" in chapter 5 of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB})—are also used in this chapter as an indicator of what it costs for someone to live in a given area, and also of the costs of goods and services there.": "在沙恩，就像任何一个大社区一样，不同阶层的人在经济光谱中占据着不同的位置。D&D用来量化生活方式支出的术语--穷困、肮脏、贫穷、适度、舒适、富有和贵族（见{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}第五章中的\"{@book Expenses|PHB|5|Expenses}\"）--在本章中也被用作某人在特定地区的生活成本指标，以及那里的商品和服务成本指标。",
	"For instance, a restaurant that is said to serve food of comfortable quality is one where a patron who lives a comfortable lifestyle (or better) can afford anything on the menu.": "例如，一个被称为提供质量舒适的食物的餐厅是一个生活舒适（或更好）的顾客可以负担得起菜单上的任何东西。",

The university is an excellent source of sages who hire their services out on a short- or long-term basis.

	"Another important site for certain kinds of research is the City Archive, in the Highest Towers district of Upper Central. The archive contains exhaustive historical documents of Sharn; birth, death, and marriage records; and copies of legal documents such as identification papers and letters of marque issued in the city. Access to these records, however, is more restricted than to the contents of the Morgrave library.": "对于某些类型的研究来说，另一个重要的地点是位于上中央最高塔区的城市档案馆。该档案馆包含了详尽的沙恩历史文件；出生、死亡和婚姻记录；以及法律文件的副本，如身份证明文件和在该市签发的侯爵书。不过，与莫格莱夫图书馆的内容相比，查阅这些记录的限制更多。",
	"Those who want to further their research through some hands-on experience might find undiscovered lore in the lowest regions of Sharn, where sewers and tunnels snake through ancient ruins. Similarly, the crypts of the City of the Dead might hold some relevant historical information.": "那些想通过亲身体验来进一步研究的人可能会在沙恩的最底层地区发现未被发现的传说，那里的下水道和隧道蜿蜒穿过古老的遗迹。同样地，亡灵之城的地下墓穴也可能有一些相关的历史信息。",
	"Sharn contains a number of major shopping districts. The Tradefair district in Middle Central focuses on top-quality goods—everything you'll need to maintain a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle. North Market in Lower Northedge has a fine selection of common goods. Almost anything can be found in the Bazaar of Middle Dura, as long as you're not concerned about the origin of secondhand goods. Tavick's Market in Middle Tavick's Landing is a center for produce and other goods brought in from the farms and artisan workshops outside Sharn.": "沙恩有许多主要的购物区。中部中央的贸易集市（Tradefair）区专注于顶级商品--你所需要的一切，以维持一个富裕或贵族的生活方式。下诺德奇的北市场有很多普通商品的选择。只要你不担心二手货的来源，几乎任何东西都可以在中杜拉的集市上找到。中杜拉的塔维克市场是一个农产品和其他商品的中心，这些商品是从沙恩外的农场和工匠作坊运来的。",
	"House Jorasco operates houses of healing throughout the city, largely in the middle and upper wards. The Panaceum in Dragon Towers (Middle Central) is the primary Jorasco enclave. The houses' services use the prices in this book's introduction.": "乔拉斯科家族在整个城市经营着治疗室，主要在中区和上区。位于龙塔（中环）的Panaceum是主要的Jorasco飞地。这些房屋的服务使用本书介绍中的价格。",
	"A few divine spellcasters in Sharn can raise the dead, notably the high priest of the Undying Court in Shae Lias. These devout clerics rarely sell their services, however, and the high priest would need a compelling reason to help someone who has different beliefs.": "在沙恩，有几个神圣的施法者可以使死人复活，特别是沙伊利亚斯的不死阁大祭司。然而，这些虔诚的神职人员很少出售他们的服务，而且大祭司需要一个令人信服的理由来帮助那些有不同信仰的人。",
	"There's always a celebration happening or about to happen in Sharn, whether it's a parade in a single district or a festival that ranges across the entire city. Here are a few special occasions to put on your calendar.": "在沙恩，总是有庆祝活动发生或即将发生，无论是单个地区的游行，还是横跨整个城市的节日。这里有几个特殊的场合，可以放在你的日历上。",
	"The ir'Tains are the richest and most powerful family in Sharn. Each month, Lady Celyria ir'Tain holds a ball at her Skyway mansion. The guest list defines the current social order of the city; those families who hold permanent invitations, known as the Sixty, are the de facto royalty of Sharn. Celyria does invite unusual guests and attractions each month, and an up-and-coming entertainer or a renowned folk hero might catch her notice.": "ir'Tain家族是沙恩最富有、最有权势的家族。每个月，塞莉娅-伊尔坦夫人都会在她的天路豪宅举行舞会。宾客名单决定了这个城市当前的社会秩序；那些拥有永久邀请函的家庭，被称为 \"60\"，是沙恩事实上的皇室成员。塞利娅每个月都会邀请不寻常的客人和景点，新晋艺人或著名的民间英雄可能会引起她的注意。",
	"During the Last War, saboteurs caused a floating tower to fall into Lower Dura. This devastation can still be seen today in the district now known as Fallen. On 9 Olarune, people gather to remember those who were lost that day. Many of them carry on a tradition of crafting elaborate ice sculptures and throwing them into the Dagger River.": "在上一次战争中，破坏者导致一座浮动塔落入下杜拉。今天在现在被称为Fallen的地区仍然可以看到这种破坏。在奥拉鲁内9日，人们聚集在一起，纪念那些在那一天失去的人。他们中的许多人继承了精心制作冰雕的传统，并把它们扔进达格河。",
	"The nation of Cyre was destroyed in 994 YK on this date, known as the Day of Mourning. Although that event had an impact on everyone in Khorvaire, this day of remembrance is especially significant to Cyran survivors. It is a time when Cyrans come together to recall their lost kingdom. Some tell stories or sing traditional songs, ensuring that their culture isn't forgotten. Other survivors still seethe with anger at the enemies who brought Cyre down, and thus far the holiday has been marked by a brief upturn in violence.": "赛尔国在994年的这一天被摧毁，被称为哀悼日。虽然这一事件对霍尔韦尔的每个人都有影响，但这个纪念日对赛尔人的幸存者来说特别重要。这是一个赛伦人聚集在一起，回忆他们失去的王国的时刻。一些人讲述故事或演唱传统歌曲，确保他们的文化不被遗忘。其他幸存者仍然对将赛尔击垮的敌人感到愤怒，到目前为止，这个节日的特点是暴力事件短暂上升。",
	"The festival of Dol Arrah is a day of peace and a time when enemies are urged to find a peaceful resolution to their conflicts. It's one of the safest days in the city for visitors and residents alike.": "多尔阿拉节是一个和平的日子，是敦促敌人找到和平解决冲突的时机。对于游客和居民来说，这是城市中最安全的日子之一。",

This activity culminates with a grand contest of champions in the Cornerstone district in Middle Tavick's Landing.": "多尔多恩的节日在整个城市都很受关注，有斗殴、摔跤比赛、射箭比赛，以及其他力量和技能的测试。这项活动的高潮是在中塔维克登陆区的基石区举行的冠军大比拼。",
	"This event is an aerial race that takes place around Dura Quarter.": "这项活动是围绕杜拉区进行的空中竞赛。",
	"In honor of the Sovereign Balinor, a fierce beast is brought to the city and released on this day into an isolated section of Old Sharn. Anyone can participate in the Hunt by making a donation of 5 gp; the hunter (or group) who brings down the beast wins a purse of 500 gp and the blessing of Balinor. The motif of the Hunt can vary; in some years, multiple beasts are released, and the hunter who catches the most of them is the victor. In any case, it often turns out that the other competitors are a greater threat to hunters than the beasts they stalk.": "为了纪念君主Balinor，一只凶猛的野兽被带到了城市，并在这一天被释放到旧沙恩的一个孤立的区域。任何人只要捐献5金币就可以参加狩猎活动；打倒猛兽的猎人（或团体）将赢得500金币的奖金和巴里诺的祝福。狩猎的主题可能有所不同；在某些年份，会放出多只野兽，抓到最多野兽的猎人就是胜利者。在任何情况下，结果往往是其他竞争者比他们跟踪的野兽对猎人的威胁更大。",
	"This celebration commemorates a priest of the Silver Flame who was martyred while exposing lycanthropes in Sharn. The day's activities often cause tension with the shifter community.": "这个庆典是为了纪念一位在揭露沙恩的狼人时殉职的银焰牧师。这一天的活动经常会引起与变身者社区的紧张关系。",
	"Gatherings across the city mark this celebration of community. The wealthy compete to throw the grandest parties, and the most generous among them will be remembered throughout the year for their largesse.": "整个城市的聚会标志着这个社区的庆祝活动。富人们竞相举办最盛大的聚会，而他们中最慷慨的人将因其慷慨而被人们记住一年。",

	"Supposedly the Fury, the god of Passion and Revenge, reaches the height of her power on this night. Emotions run high, and impulse control runs low. Shy and superstitious folk stay indoors, while others see it as a time to cast aside inhibitions. The streets fill with revelry that lasts well into the night.": "据称，激情和复仇之神 \"愤怒 \"在这个夜晚达到了她力量的顶峰。情绪高涨，冲动控制力下降。羞涩和迷信的人留在室内，而其他人则认为这是一个抛开禁忌的时刻。街道上充满了狂欢，一直持续到晚上。",
	"This observance marks the day that the Treaty of Thronehold was signed, officially ending the Last War. This year (998 YK) is only the second time the event has been commemorated, and the Lord Mayor of Sharn has promised a truly epic festival.": "这个纪念活动标志着《王权条约》的签署，正式结束了最后的战争。今年（998年）是该事件的第二次纪念，沙恩市长承诺将举办一个真正的史诗般的节日。",
	"It's said that the power of the Shadow, the sinister deity of the Dark Six, is at its height during these three nights. Careful people spend this time indoors with friends, but those who relish the darkness might decide to take to the streets to prey on the weak and foolish.": "据说在这三个晚上，黑暗六人组的阴险神灵--阴影的力量达到了顶峰。小心翼翼的人在室内与朋友一起度过这段时间，但那些对黑暗感兴趣的人可能会决定上街掠夺弱者和愚蠢的人。",
	"Banners are flying across Dura today, and the streets are full of color. Walk through Oldkeep wearing brown and red, and you'll be invited to raise a glass to the Griffon; if you're dressed in white and gold, the colors of the Hippogriff, you'd best be prepared to defend yourself.": "今天，横幅在杜拉上空飘扬，街道上充满了色彩。穿着棕色和红色的衣服走过Oldkeep，你会被邀请为狮鹫举杯；如果你穿着白色和金色的衣服，即河马的颜色，你最好准备好保护自己。",
	"If you're new to Sharn, you might think our city's gone mad. And in some ways it has, but it's a madness that reaches its peak every summer with the Race of Eight Winds. Long ago, King Galifar used Dura as a proving ground for aerial calvary. What's more important, quickness or strength? Our modern race is a test of speed and skill through a course that weaves around and through the spires of Dura. There are eight competitors, and each of these brave jockeys rides a different flying creature—except for the gargoyle Carralag, who relies on his own wings!": "如果你是第一次来到沙恩，你可能会认为我们的城市已经疯了。在某些方面确实如此，但这种疯狂在每年夏天的 \"八风赛 \"中达到顶峰。很久以前，加里法尔国王把杜拉作为一个空降兵的试验场。什么更重要，是速度还是力量？我们的现代比赛是对速度和技巧的考验，比赛路线围绕着杜拉的尖顶，并在其中穿梭。有八名参赛者，这些勇敢的骑师每人都骑着不同的飞行生物--除了夜行神龙卡拉拉格，他依靠自己的翅膀!",
	"Speed is important, but merely surviving the race can be a challenge. The spilling of blood isn't prohibited, but the only weapon a rider can carry is a light sporting crossbow; the steeds can use their talons and beaks, which is what makes the Griffon such a fierce contender. Poison, magic, or anything else that would directly interfere with beast or rider is strictly forbidden—though over the years we've certainly seen imaginative attempts to stretch the rules!": "速度很重要，但仅仅是在比赛中生存下来也是一种挑战。不禁止流血，但骑手可以携带的唯一武器是轻型运动弩；骏马可以使用它们的爪子和喙，这就是狮鹫如此激烈的竞争者。毒药、魔法或其他任何会直接干扰野兽或骑手的东西都是严格禁止的--尽管多年来我们确实看到了富有想象力的尝试来扩展规则的范围",
	"Dura is divided into eight regions for the race, each of which is represented by a different creature. If you're going to spend time in Dura, it's best that you know your mounts! The beasts of Upper Dura are the fastest in the race, and overall have the best record. The reigning champion is the Pegasus of Highwater, whose supporters wear white and silver. The Hippogriff is tied to Overlook and Daggerwatch in Upper Dura, and its colors are white and gold. Detractors often say that the Sharn Watch favors the Hippogriff and that House Vadalis helps the Pegasus, but the referees always insist that the race is fair.": "杜拉被划分为八个地区的比赛，每个地区都有不同的生物代表。如果你要在杜拉花时间，最好是了解你的坐骑! 上杜拉的野兽在比赛中速度最快，而且总体上有最好的记录。卫冕冠军是高水的飞马，它的支持者穿着白色和银色的衣服。河马与上杜拉的眺望和匕首守望联系在一起，其颜色是白色和金色。诋毁者经常说，沙恩守望偏爱河马，瓦达里斯家族帮助飞马，但裁判总是坚持比赛是公平的。",
	"The beasts of Middle Dura are versatile. The Eagle represents Broken Arch and Stormhold in Middle Dura, and its supporters wear brown and gold. The clever Owl flies for Rattlestone and the Bazaar, and its colors are brown and gray. The Hawk represents Tumbledown and Underlook in Middle Dura, and wearing its blend of tan and brown can usually get you a good price at an inn.": "中杜拉的野兽是多功能的。鹰在中杜拉代表破碎拱门和斯托姆霍德，它的支持者穿着棕色和金色。聪明的猫头鹰代表Rattlestone和Bazaar飞行，它的颜色是棕色和灰色。鹰在中杜拉代表翻滚镇和暗影，穿上它的褐色和棕色的混合色，通常可以在旅馆里得到一个好价钱。",
	"The beasts of Lower Dura are more infamous than reliable. The Griffon flies for Precarious and Oldkeep, and its colors are brown and red. It has never won the race, but there's gold to be made betting on which opponent it will bring down. The Glidewing represents Gate of Gold and The Stores, and its supporters wear green and gray; many believe that the Boromar Clan pays for the upkeep of the mount and its rider. Malleon's Gate used to be represented by the Bat, but twelve years ago they exchanged that mascot for the Gargoyle, whose colors are black and gray. The current {@creature Gargoyle} is a stone-faced fellow named Carralag, and his supporters are quite passionate about their winged champion.": "下杜拉的野兽比可靠的更臭名昭著。狮鹫为普雷塞斯和奥德堡飞行，它的颜色是棕色和红色。它从未在比赛中获胜，但赌它会打倒哪个对手，就能赚到金子。滑翔翼代表黄金之门和商店，它的支持者穿着绿色和灰色的衣服；许多人相信博罗玛家族会支付坐骑和骑手的维护费用。马利翁之门曾经由蝙蝠代表，但12年前他们把这个吉祥物换成了鬼怪，其颜色是黑色和灰色。现在的{@creature Gargoyle}是一个叫卡拉拉格的石脸家伙，他的支持者们对他们的有翼冠军相当热情。",
	"As befits a metropolis that boasts people of all cultures, Sharn hosts a wide variety of sports and athletic events. The Race of Eight Winds occurs once a year. Other events take place on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule. For instance, shifters hold informal hrazhak competitions every night in Lower Northedge. The ogres of the Cogs are fond of tugs-of-war, arm wrestling, and similarly simple tests of strength. People who want to bet on sports can usually find a gambler willing to set odds in the Firelight district in Lower Menthis, Callestan in Lower Dura, Cornerstone in Middle Tavick's Landing, or Hareth's Folly in Middle Dura. Three exotic sports practiced in the city are described below.": "作为一个拥有各种文化的人的大都市，沙恩举办了各种各样的运动和体育赛事。八风赛每年举行一次。其他活动则按日、周或月的时间表进行。例如，移居者每天晚上在下诺德奇举行非正式的哈拉扎克比赛。Cogs的食人魔喜欢拔河、掰手腕，以及类似的简单力量测试。想在体育上下注的人通常可以在下门提斯的火光区、下杜拉的卡莱斯坦、中塔维克兰丁的基石或中杜拉的哈雷斯之家找到愿意设定赔率的赌徒。下文介绍了城市中开展的三种异国运动。",
	"Two teams of seven shifters play hrazhak on a field with a goal at each end. Each team starts out carrying a wooden idol. To score, a team must steal its opponent's idol and place both idols in its own goal. Obstacles such as trees, streams, and piles of rubble can be present on a hrazhak field, requiring the competitors to make full use of their jumping and climbing abilities. Idols can be thrown or carried, and there are no limits on contact between participants, although only natural weapons are allowed. Typically, a low-level druid or adept is on hand to provide healing if needed—but any competitor who receives aid is removed from play for the remainder of the match. Competitors aren't allowed to use spells or similar abilities.": "两队七名移位者在两端各有一个球门的场地上玩hrazhak。每队开始时都带着一个木制神像。为了得分，一队必须偷取对手的神像，并将两个神像放在自己的球门里。障碍物，如树木、溪流和成堆的瓦砾都可能出现在hrazhak场地上，要求参赛者充分利用他们的跳跃和攀爬能力。偶像可以被投掷或携带，参与者之间的接触也没有限制，但只允许使用天然武器。通常情况下，如果需要，会有一个低级德鲁伊或神通者在现场提供治疗--但任何接受援助的竞争者都会在比赛的剩余时间内被取消比赛资格。竞争者不允许使用法术或类似能力。",
	"The only formal hrazhak arena in Sharn is located in the Stone Trees, part of the Cornerstone district, where the matches serve as both a spectator sport and a reason for gambling. Shifters created temporary hrazhak fields in the slums and warehouse districts of the city from time to time, and shifter youths often play impromptu games in the parks.": "沙恩唯一正式的赫拉扎克竞技场位于基石区的石树，那里的比赛既是一项观赏性运动，也是赌博的理由。移居者不时地在城市的贫民窟和仓库区创建临时的哈拉扎克场，移居者的年轻人经常在公园里进行即兴的比赛。",
	"Informal matches, which don't always use the same rules, occur from time to time in Lower and Middle Dura, Tavick's Landing, and Menthis Plateau. An informal match might be played out across an entire district, with competitors weaving between towers and around bridges. The rules for an informal match are set before the start, establishing (among other things) whether magic can be used and mounts can be targeted.": "非正式比赛并不总是使用相同的规则，在下杜拉和中杜拉、塔维克登陆点和门斯高原时有发生。一场非正式比赛可能会在整个地区进行，选手们在塔楼和桥梁之间穿梭。非正式比赛的规则在开始前就已经设定好了，确定了（除其他事项外）是否可以使用魔法和坐骑可以被瞄准。",
	"Six stones matches are staged by the criminal organization Daask (see the \"{@book Criminal Activities|ERLW|8|Criminal Activities}\" section later in this chapter). The sport is illegal, but the games go on because the matches are confined to Lower Dura and the Cogs and well hidden from the eyes of the Watch. A match usually occurs only once every few months. Sometimes participants voluntarily enter the competition, but most are debtors who have been offered a chance to pay off their loans by winning the match. Daask takes bets on the outcome, and usually earns a tidy sum as its share of the proceeds.": "六块石头的比赛是由犯罪组织Daask（见本章后面的\"{@book Criminal Activities|ERLW|8|Criminal Activities} \"部分）举办的。这项运动是非法的，但比赛仍在继续，因为比赛只限于下杜拉和科格斯地区，并且很好地隐藏了观察者的眼睛。通常每隔几个月才发生一次比赛。有时参赛者自愿参加比赛，但大多数是债务人，他们得到了通过赢得比赛来偿还贷款的机会。达斯克接受对结果的赌注，并通常赚取一笔不菲的收入作为其收益份额。",
	"Sharn has many people in positions of power: beadles, ministers, bailiffs, and all manner of minor functionaries and officials. But ultimate power rests in the hands of the City Council. That body has seventeen members: one for each ward in the city, plus representatives from Skyway and the Cogs. Each ward has its own process for selecting a councilor, and there are no legal restrictions on who can govern; if you build up a strong base of support in a ward, you could hold the position yourself!": "沙恩有很多人担任权力职务：执事、部长、法警，以及各种小职能部门和官员。但最终的权力掌握在市议会的手中。该机构有17名成员：城市的每个区都有一名成员，加上来自Skyway和Cogs的代表。每个区都有自己的程序来选择议员，对谁可以执政没有法律限制；如果你在一个区建立了强大的支持基础，你可以自己担任这个职位",
	"The members of the City Council are quite diverse. Some are crooked, others are idealists, and one of them appears to be an owl. All of them are well known in their home wards, and any of them could have use for a team of adventurers. The Sharn Councilors table describes a few of the city leaders you might bump into in Upper Central or at the Tain Gala. If your character has the noble background, you might already know one of them.": "市议会的成员是相当多样化的。有些是歪门邪道，有些是理想主义者，还有一个似乎是猫头鹰。他们都在自己的辖区内很有名气，他们中的任何一个都可以为冒险者团队所用。沙恩议员表描述了一些你可能在上层中心区或泰恩晚会上碰到的城市领导人。如果你的角色有贵族背景，你可能已经认识他们中的一个。",
	"{@b Sorik Sensos} (human) represents Middle Central. An elder statesman and a brilliant orator, he is rumored to be involved in a web of bribery and graft.": "{@b Sorik Sensos}（人）代表中原。他是一位年长的政治家，也是一位出色的演说家，据传他参与了一个贿赂和贪污的网络。",

Since taking her seat, she has fought to improve conditions for the lower classes of Sharn, and she has made many enemies on the council and beyond.": "{@b Sava Kharisa}（人类）是来自下中央的直言不讳的议员。自从就任以来，她一直在为改善沙恩下层阶级的条件而奋斗，她在议会内外树了很多敌人。",

	"{@b Savia Potellas} (human) has her hand in the entertainment industry of Lower Menthis. She hopes to reduce the influence of organized crime in her district, but it's a dangerous game.": "{@b Savia Potellas}(人类)在Lower Menthis的娱乐业有她的手。她希望能减少有组织犯罪在她所在地区的影响，但这是一个危险的游戏。",
	"{@b Maza Thadian} (elf) represents Upper Northedge. A venerable elf and owner of one of the finest restaurants in Sharn, she fights to maintain tradition but definitely puts the needs of the wealthy ahead of the poor.": "{@b Maza Thadian}(精灵)代表上诺德奇。她是一个可敬的精灵，也是沙恩最好的餐馆之一的老板，她努力维持传统，但绝对把富人的需求放在穷人的前面。",

He has a reputation for stirring up conflict and setting the other councilors against one another.": "{@b Bestan ir'Tonn}(半身人)代表上塔维克城30年了，基本上把他的选区看作是城中的一个独立城市。他以挑起冲突和挑拨其他议员之间的关系而闻名。",
	"{@b Kilk} (changeling) represents the merchants of Lower Tavick's Landing. Whispered rumors suggest that the changeling has ties to the mysterious Tyrants. Some insist that Kilk is actually an identity shared by a group of changelings.": "{@b Kilk}(changeling)代表下塔维克城的商人。低声的传言表明，变种人与神秘的暴君们有联系。有些人坚持认为，基尔克实际上是一群变种人共同的身份。",
	"{@b Hruitt} (owl) is a {@creature giant owl} who can assume human form. A former aerial racer, he's a clever negotiator who fights for the good of the Bazaar and Middle Dura, often opposing the Boromar Clan and its allies.": "{@b Hruitt}(猫头鹰)是一个可以变成人形的{@creature giant owl}。他曾是一名空中赛车手，是一个聪明的谈判者，为巴扎和中杜拉的利益而战，经常反对博洛玛家族及其盟友。",
	"{@b Ilyra Boromar} (halfling) is the councilor for Lower Dura, but it's common knowledge that her true allegiance is to her family and its criminal empire. The current ongoing conflict with Daask has weakened her family and her position.": "{@b Ilyra Boromar}（半身人）是下杜拉的议员，但众所周知，她真正效忠的是她的家族和其犯罪帝国。目前与达斯克的持续冲突削弱了她的家族和她的地位。",
	"{@b Evix ir'Marasha} (human) represents Skyway. Lady Marasha owns the Celestial Vista restaurant, along with several other valuable businesses.

	"{@b Nolan Toranak} (dwarf), the councilor for the Cogs, is largely seen as a tool of the industrialists who own the foundries there.

He has tried to have warforged reclassified as property, and seeks to suppress warforged activists in the Cogs.": "{@b Nolan Toranak}（矮人），Cogs的议员，在很大程度上被视为拥有那里的铸造厂的工业家的一个工具。他的家人在最后一次战争中被战锻人杀死，托拉纳克对坎尼斯家族和战锻人怀有强烈的怨恨。他曾试图将战锻人重新归类为财产，并试图压制Cogs的战锻人活动家。",

Priests don't usually sell their services; temples are places for worship and spiritual guidance.": "每个主要的宗教在沙恩都有前哨站。一些圣地吸引着来自布雷兰和霍尔韦尔各地的朝圣者来到这座城市。牧师通常不出售他们的服务；寺庙是崇拜和精神指导的地方。",
	"The Sovereign Host is the dominant religion of Breland, represented by shrines and small temples throughout the city. The Pavilion of the Host in Middle Central is the heart of the faith, and most priests of the Host live in one of the Pavilion's nine towers. Pilgrims often come to visit one of three particular sites. The Korranath in Upper Central features Khorvaire's largest temple of Kol Korran.

The Pool of Onatar's Tears in the Blackbones district of the Cogs is said to impart a blessing to any smith who bathes their hands in its waters.": "主教是布雷兰的主导宗教，在整个城市中以神龛和小庙为代表。位于中环的主神阁是该信仰的核心，大多数主神的牧师都住在主神阁的九座塔中的一座。朝圣者通常会来参观三个特定地点中的一个。位于上中部的科拉纳特（Korranath）有霍尔韦尔最大的科尔科兰神庙。位于上Menthis的Aureon大殿吸引了众多学者和崇拜者。位于科加斯黑骨区的奥纳塔之泪池据说能给任何在池水中沐浴的铁匠带来祝福。",
	"The Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame, Sharn's largest temple to the Silver Flame, is located in Upper Central. Archierophant Ythana Morr is frequently accused of corruption and nepotism, but there are smaller places of worship around the city devoted to the true principles of the faith. The hermit Gaia watches over the City of the Dead from Warden Tower. Coldflame Keep in Middle Northedge was once a mighty garrison; its glory has faded, but Flamebearer Mazin Tana still strives to protect his community. The priestess Faela maintains a small shrine in the shadows of Fallen, doing what she can to help the wretched people of that forsaken district. Finally, the Shrine of Fathen the Martyr is a sacred site in North Market, often visited by templars passing through the city.": "洁净之火大教堂是沙恩最大的银色火焰神庙，位于上中部。大主教伊萨娜-莫尔（Ythana Morr）经常被指责为腐败和任人唯亲，但城市周围有一些较小的礼拜场所，致力于信仰的真正原则。隐士盖亚（Gaia）在典狱长塔上监视着死亡之城。位于中诺德奇的冷焰堡曾经是一个强大的驻军；它的荣耀已经褪去，但火焰使者马津-塔纳仍然努力保护他的社区。女祭司法拉（Faela）在堕落区的阴影中维持着一个小神殿，尽她所能帮助那个被遗弃的地区的可怜人。最后，殉道者法坦（Fathen）的神殿是北市场的一个圣地，经常有经过该市的圣殿骑士前来参观。",
	"Even some lesser known religions are represented in Sharn. The Graystone district in Middle Tavick's Landing is a haven for followers of the Blood of Vol. The Gates of Passage in Upper Northedge is a temple of the Undying Court. The Overlook district of Upper Dura holds the Shrine of il-Yannah, dedicated to the Path of Light.": "甚至一些不太知名的宗教在沙恩也有代表。中塔维克城的灰石区是沃尔之血信徒的天堂。 上诺特奇的通道之门是不死阁的寺庙。上杜拉的眺望区有伊尔-雅娜神殿，专门供奉光明之路。",
	"Guilds and similar associations abound in Sharn. Their headquarters are places where people can find the company of fellow professionals, or perhaps enlist the assistance of an organization.": "在沙恩，行会和类似的协会比比皆是。他们的总部是人们可以找到同行的地方，也可能是寻求组织的帮助。",
	"All the guilds associated with the dragonmarked houses are well represented in Sharn; most have guildhalls in the Dragon Towers district of Middle Central. Aside from those groups, the city features a number of less populous associations, such as those described below.": "所有与龙纹屋相关的行会在沙恩都有很好的代表性；大多数行会在中环的龙塔区都有行会馆。除了这些团体之外，这个城市还有一些人数较少的协会，比如下面介绍的那些。",
	"Sharn is a magnet for those who seek adventure and opportunity. Forgotten treasures are hidden in the ruins below the towers, and expeditions leave for Xen'drik every day. At any moment, dozens of sages, spies, and nobles around the city are searching for capable agents to help with their schemes and investigations. If you and your friends are searching for adventure, you've come to the right place, and you don't have to do it alone. Sharn is home to two organizations that provide adventurers with opportunities for work and camaraderie: the Clifftop Adventurer's Guild and the Deathsgate Guild.": "沙恩对那些寻求冒险和机会的人来说是一块磁石。被遗忘的宝藏隐藏在塔楼下的废墟中，探险队每天都会出发前往Xen'drik。在任何时候，城市周围的几十个圣人、间谍和贵族都在寻找有能力的代理人来帮助他们的计划和调查。如果你和你的朋友正在寻找冒险，你就来对地方了，而且你不需要独自行动。沙恩有两个组织为冒险者提供工作和友情的机会：悬崖顶冒险者公会和死亡之门公会。",
	"Those who are accepted into either adventurer's guild must pay dues of 12 gp each year. The primary benefit of belonging to a guild is access to work, since the guildmaster can connect parties of adventurers with patrons and jobs suited to their talents. Beyond that, there are a few additional benefits:": "那些被接纳为冒险者公会的人必须每年缴纳12金币的会费。加入公会的主要好处是可以获得工作，因为公会会长可以为冒险家们联系到适合他们才能的赞助人和工作。除此之外，还有一些额外的好处。",
	"You can store items at the guildhall free of charge.": "你可以在市政厅免费储存物品。",
	"You can book lodging at the guildhall for 5 sp per night. The accommodations are modest, but the guild provides stronger security for lodgers and their possessions than you'd find at an inn.": "你可以在公会里预订住宿，每晚5英镑。住宿条件一般，但公会为住宿者和他们的财产提供了比旅馆更强的安全保障。",
	"An adventurer's guild is an excellent source of information. By studying records and working with other guild members, you can gain advantage on any skill check to research a subject in which the guild has expertise or experience.": "冒险家协会是一个很好的信息来源。通过研究记录和与其他公会成员合作，你可以在任何技能检查中获得优势，以研究公会有专长或经验的主题。",
	"A strong rivalry exists between the Deathsgate Guild and the Clifftop Adventurer's Guild. You might have trouble with members of the opposing guild, whether in the form of drunken boasting in a tavern or a rival stirring up trouble in the midst of a mission.": "死亡之门公会和克利夫托普冒险者公会之间存在着强烈的竞争关系。你可能会与敌对公会的成员发生矛盾，无论是在酒馆里的醉酒吹嘘，还是在任务中的对手挑起的麻烦。",
	"Located in the Clifftop district of Upper Dura, this organization has a sterling reputation as a source of reliable explorers and champions. Clifftop adventurers are known for their courage and integrity, and guildmaster Summer Korranor holds members to a high standard of virtuous behavior. As a Clifftop adventurer, you're expected to keep your word, to stand by your comrades, to uphold the law, and never to intentionally endanger innocents with your actions. Many of the local businesses cater to adventurers, and if you're a member of the guild, you can expect a warm welcome in the taverns of Clifftop.": "该组织位于上杜拉的悬崖顶区，作为可靠的探险家和冠军的来源，有着良好的声誉。悬崖顶冒险者以其勇气和正直而闻名，公会会长Summer Korranor对成员的品德行为要求很高。作为一个克利夫托普冒险者，你应该遵守你的诺言，站在你的同伴一边，维护法律，并且永远不要故意用你的行动来危害无辜者。当地的许多企业迎合了冒险者的需求，如果你是公会的成员，你可以期待在克利夫托普的酒馆里受到热烈欢迎。",
	"Adventurers who are willing to take on any job and to do whatever it takes to triumph might find themselves suited for membership in the Deathsgate Guild. Named for its proximity to the City of the Dead, the district of Deathsgate prides itself on being a haven for those who challenge death on a daily basis. The guild's founder, Kassh \"Blackaxe\" Droranath, doesn't care how his members do their jobs, as long as they don't fail.": "愿意承担任何工作并不惜一切代价取得胜利的冒险者可能会发现自己适合加入死亡之门公会。由于靠近死亡之城而得名，死亡之门区以成为那些每天都在挑战死亡的人的天堂而自豪。公会的创始人，\"黑斧 \"德洛兰斯（Kassh \"Blackaxe\" Droranath）并不关心他的成员如何完成他们的工作，只要他们不失败就行。",
	"A bard is a versatile individual, equally skilled at entertainment and espionage. These talents are perfectly matched to the city of Sharn, which is both the cultural heart of Breland and a nexus for intrigue and diplomacy. Bards have much to gain from the company of other bards, as they exchange news, stories, and songs. For this purpose, long ago a group of the finest bards in Sharn founded the Circle of Song, an alliance of entertainers and adventurers.": "吟游诗人是一个多面手，同样擅长娱乐和间谍活动。这些才能与沙恩城完美匹配，它既是布雷兰德的文化中心，又是阴谋和外交的枢纽。吟游诗人从其他吟游诗人的陪伴中获益良多，因为他们可以交流新闻、故事和歌曲。为此，很久以前，一群沙恩最优秀的吟游诗人成立了 \"歌之环\"，这是一个由艺人和冒险家组成的联盟。",
	"The Circle of Song is an informal organization, open to any bard who knows its customs and who can find an outpost. It has no membership dues; you're expected to make a donation if you make significant use of the group's resources. Membership provides the following benefits:": "歌之圈是一个非正式的组织，向任何了解其习俗并能找到前哨的吟游诗人开放。它没有会员费；如果你大量使用该组织的资源，你会被期望进行捐赠。会员资格提供以下好处。",
	"You can always find food and lodging at a circle outpost, though you might be expected to entertain the patrons in exchange. If times are tough, your food and lodging might be a step lower than the usual quality of the inn, but at least it's free.": "你总能在一个圈子的前哨找到食物和住宿，尽管你可能会被期望招待食客作为交换。如果时局艰难，你的食物和住宿可能比客栈的通常质量低一个档次，但至少是免费的。",
	"You have advantage on ability checks made to perform research or gather information while in a circle outpost, provided you have an opportunity to peruse archives and talk with other members.": "只要你有机会阅读档案并与其他成员交谈，你在进行研究或收集信息的能力检查中具有优势。",
	"Circle members are often willing to do minor favors for other members—gathering information, embarrassing a minor noble, causing a distraction. There's no cost for such a service, but anyone who helps you will expect you to provide similar assistance when they need it.": "圈子成员往往愿意为其他成员做一些小事--收集信息，让一个小贵族难堪，造成分心。这样的服务是没有成本的，但任何帮助你的人都会希望你在他们需要时提供类似的帮助。",
	"The first and oldest outpost of the Circle of Song is the Golden Horn in the University district of Upper Menthis; a few bards are almost always in residence and willing to share news and stories. Other, less elaborate outposts are maintained in Sharn, and over the centuries the circle has established outposts in most major cities and many smaller communities across Khorvaire. These sites are usually taverns or inns that have hidden areas accessible only to members of the circle.": "歌之环的第一个也是最古老的前哨站是位于上曼提斯大学区的金角；几个吟游诗人几乎总是居住在这里，愿意分享新闻和故事。在沙恩还有其他不那么精致的前哨站，几个世纪以来，歌谣圈在霍尔韦尔的大多数主要城市和许多小社区都建立了前哨站。这些地方通常是酒馆或旅馆，有只有圈子成员才能进入的隐藏区域。",
	"Bards are expected to set aside personal rivalries while in a circle outpost, and any kind of combat or violence is prohibited. Violating this rule results in immediate expulsion from the circle, at the least.": "吟游诗人在圈内前哨时，应将个人的争斗放在一边，禁止任何形式的战斗或暴力。违反这一规则，至少会被立即驱逐出圈子。",
	"Its mighty towers and floating spires mark Sharn as a symbol of mystic power and achievement. Soon after the founding of the city, the greatest wizards of Breland chose it to be the seat of their arcane order. Its goal was to celebrate excellence in the mystic arts, bringing together the greatest practitioners of magic in a society that rivals Arcanix and the institutions of Aundair.": "它强大的塔楼和漂浮的尖顶使沙恩成为神秘力量和成就的象征。在建城后不久，布雷兰德最伟大的巫师们选择这里作为他们的奥术组织的所在地。它的目标是庆祝神秘艺术的卓越成就，将最伟大的魔法从业者聚集在一起，与阿卡尼克斯和昂代尔的机构相媲美。",
	"A schism split the original society, but today both of the branches of the original organization, the Esoteric Order of Aureon and the Guild of Starlight and Shadows, are recognized and respected throughout Breland. Each one has lesser halls in every major city in the nation.": "一场分裂分裂了原来的社会，但今天原组织的两个分支，奥瑞恩密教团和星光与阴影公会，都在整个布雷兰得到认可和尊重。每个组织在全国各大城市都有较少的会馆。",
	"Someone accepted into an arcane order must pay 1,000 gp to join, with ongoing dues of 250 gp each year thereafter. With this payment comes many benefits, including the following:": "被接受加入奥术团的人必须支付1,000金币才能加入，此后每年支付250金币的持续会费。这笔钱带来了许多好处，包括以下内容。",
	"You can stay at the order's hall in any major city and enjoy the amenities of a wealthy lifestyle free of charge.": "你可以住在任何大城市的秩序厅，免费享受富裕生活的设施。",
	"Membership in an arcane order grants prestige within Breland. Though this status provides no tangible benefit, it proves that you are a gifted mage and stand above any mere magewright or dabbler.": "奥术团的成员资格在布雷兰德内部具有威望。虽然这种地位没有提供任何实际的好处，但它证明了你是一个有天赋的法师，并高于任何单纯的魔法师或涉猎者。",
	"Members of the larger of the two societies, the Esoteric Order of Aureon, take a vow to use their talents to preserve and advance civilization and to operate within the confines of the law. The Esoteric Order helped Galifar I maintain the rule of law, and many of its members served Breland during the Last War. Although its members aren't prohibited from studying any form of magic, the specialties of the order are abjuration, divination, and evocation magic. Wizards and artificers are almost always welcome in the guild. Sorcerers must prove their grasp of arcane theory to earn a place, and warlocks are rarely accepted as members. The hall of the Esoteric Order of Aureon is in the district of Clifftop in Upper Dura.": "这两个社团中较大的社团--奥瑞恩密教团的成员发誓要利用他们的才能来维护和推进文明，并在法律的范围内运作。神秘教团帮助加利法尔一世维持法治，它的许多成员在最后的战争中为布雷兰德服务。虽然它的成员并不被禁止学习任何形式的魔法，但该组织的专长是咒语、占卜和召唤魔法。巫师和工匠在公会里几乎都是受欢迎的。巫师必须证明他们对奥术理论的掌握才能获得一席之地，而术士则很少被接纳为会员。奥瑞恩神秘教团的大厅位于上杜拉的克利夫托普区。",
	"Breland's other arcane order encourages independence and innovation, qualities that contribute to a mutually uncomfortable relationship between the Guild of Starlight and Shadows and the Sharn Watch. The schools of conjuration, enchantment, and illusion are favored by this group. Warlocks, especially those of the Archfey, are generally welcome. Members of the Esoteric Order look down on Starlight wizards, and in turn the guild members often mock the wizards of the Esoteric Order and play pranks on them. The Guild of Starlight and Shadows has its hall in the Deathsgate district in Middle Tavick's Landing.": "布雷兰德的另一个奥术团体鼓励独立和创新，这些品质导致了星光与阴影公会和沙恩守望之间相互不舒服的关系。这个团体偏爱法术、魔法和幻术流派。术士，尤其是那些大帝的术士，通常是受欢迎的。神秘教团的成员看不起星光的巫师，反过来，公会成员也经常嘲笑神秘教团的巫师，并对他们进行恶作剧。星光与阴影公会的大厅位于中塔维克城的死亡之门区。",
	"There is one dark stain in the shared history of the arcane orders. Three hundred years ago, a third order arose in Sharn—a sinister cabal called the Closed Circle. This order specialized in transmutation and necromancy and dabbled in the forbidden lore of the daelkyr and the Dragon Below. It's said that the members of the Closed Circle went mad and sought to summon terrible things; whatever the truth, the guild was wiped out more than two hundred years ago by the combined action of the Church of the Silver Flame, the Esoteric Order, and the Guild of Starlight and Shadows. Hidden workshops of the Closed Circle might still be found in Sharn, where vengeful liches or other wizards of the Circle practice their dark arts in hiding.": "在奥术团的共同历史中，有一个黑暗的污点。三百年前，沙恩出现了第三个教团--一个名为 \"封闭圈 \"的阴险组织。这个组织专门从事转化和死灵法术，并涉足达尔凯尔和下龙的禁忌传说。据说封闭圈的成员发疯了，并试图召唤可怕的东西；无论真相如何，这个公会在两百多年前被银焰教会、神秘教团和星光与阴影公会的联合行动消灭了。在沙恩可能还能找到封闭圈的隐蔽工场，在那里，复仇的地衣或其他圈内的巫师在隐蔽地练习他们的黑暗艺术。",
	"Sharn is a vertical city, and elevation is an indicator of status and wealth. Each quarter is roughly divided into three levels, and the combination of quarter and level defines a ward. Thus, wards have names such as Lower Dura, Upper Central, and Middle Menthis.": "沙恩是一个垂直的城市，海拔高度是地位和财富的指标。每个区大致分为三个级别，区和级别的组合定义了一个区。因此，区的名称有下杜拉、上中央和中门提斯等。",
	"Upper wards are the domain of the rich and powerful. Here you'll find the finest goods and the most expensive services. Only those who maintain a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle can easily afford the prices for meals and lodging, and adventurers who maintain a squalid or wretched lifestyle might be treated with disdain (suffering disadvantage on Charisma checks).": "上层病房是富人和权贵的领域。在这里你可以找到最好的商品和最昂贵的服务。只有那些保持富裕或贵族生活方式的人才能轻松地负担得起餐饮和住宿的价格，而那些保持肮脏或卑劣生活方式的冒险者可能会受到轻视（在魅力检查中受到不利影响）。",
	"Violence is rare in any of the upper wards, and the Sharn Watch actively patrols these areas. Although the guards here might be corrupt just as in a middle or lower ward, they're already being well paid by powerful nobles and criminal organizations, and they work efficiently in the service of these forces.": "在任何一个上层区，暴力事件都是罕见的，而且沙恩看守所积极地在这些地区巡逻。虽然这里的守卫可能会像中区或下区一样腐败，但他们已经被有权势的贵族和犯罪组织支付了高额的报酬，而且他们在为这些势力服务时工作很有效率。",
	"Middle wards are home to the middle classes. Here you'll find bustling markets and taverns, along with a wide range of entertainment and housing. Most goods and services are affordable by those of a modest or comfortable lifestyle, with a few higher-priced options tucked away. The Sharn Watch has a presence, but not as strong as in the upper wards.": "中间区是中产阶级的家。在这里，你会发现热闹的市场和酒馆，以及广泛的娱乐和住房。大多数商品和服务都是那些生活适度或舒适的人可以负担得起的，但也有一些价格较高的选择隐藏在其中。沙恩观察站也有存在，但不像上层区那样强大。",
	"Lower wards house the hard-working laborers, along with the destitute and the desperate, including refugees who lost everything in the war and orphans who never had anything to begin with. Services priced for a modest lifestyle can be found, but overall the lower wards are home to those who have no better than a poor lifestyle; a visitor who displays signs of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle might attract unwanted attention. The watch pays little attention to the lower districts, making them a haven for criminals and gangs.": "下层病房住着辛勤工作的劳动者，以及赤贫和绝望的人，包括在战争中失去一切的难民和从未有过的孤儿。可以找到价格适中的服务，但总的来说，下层区是那些没有更好的生活方式的人的家；显示出富裕或贵族生活方式迹象的访客可能会引起不必要的注意。观察者很少关注低层区，使其成为罪犯和帮派的天堂。",
	"These are stereotypes that don't apply to all wards. Dura is a particularly poor quarter, meaning that Upper Dura is effectively a middle ward in economic terms; similarly, because Central Plateau is a hub of wealth and power, Lower Central is effectively a middle ward.": "这些定型观念并不适用于所有选区。杜拉是一个特别贫穷的区，这意味着上杜拉在经济方面实际上是一个中等区；同样，由于中原是一个财富和权力的中心，下中原实际上是一个中等区。",
	"Each ward is further subdivided into districts, which are neighborhoods defined by an economic role, a separate culture, or both. For example, Lower Northedge includes the districts of Stoneyard, Longstairs, and North Market. It's generally true that the combination of a district's ward and quarter will give you a broad idea of what to expect there. A district in Upper Central will typically be well kept and swarming with guards, while a district in Lower Dura will be squalid and dangerous.": "每个区又被进一步细分为若干个区，这些区是由经济角色、独立的文化或两者界定的街区。例如，Lower Northedge包括Stoneyard、Longstairs和North Market等区。一般来说，一个区的区和季度的组合可以让你大致了解那里的情况。上中区的一个区通常会有很好的维护，并有大量的警卫，而下杜拉区的一个区则是肮脏和危险的。",
	"Sharn is an enormous city, and traveling on foot from one side of the city to the other can be time-consuming. Here are some travel-time guidelines:": "沙恩是一个巨大的城市，从城市的一边步行到另一边可能会很费时间。以下是一些旅行时间指南。",
	"It takes at least 30 minutes to cross a ward.": "穿越一个病房至少需要30分钟。",
	"If you're traveling between wards, add 30 minutes for each ward you pass through.": "如果你在病房之间旅行，每经过一个病房就增加30分钟。",
	"Dura and Tavick's Landing are especially large; double the time it takes to move through one of them.": "杜拉和塔维克登陆点特别大；在其中一个地方移动的时间要加倍。",
	"For instance, traveling from Lower Menthis to Upper Central involves passing through three wards (taking a bridge from Lower Menthis to Lower Central, then ascending two levels) and can take 90 minutes or longer.": "例如，从Lower Menthis到Upper Central需要经过三个区（从Lower Menthis走桥到Lower Central，然后上升两层），可能需要90分钟或更长时间。",
	"Not all the quarters are linked to one another by bridges. The connections that do exist include these:": "并非所有的街区都有桥梁相连接。确实存在的连接包括这些。",
	"Central Plateau has bridges that lead to Northedge and Menthis.": "中央高原有桥梁通往Northedge和Menthis。",
	"Dura is connected to Tavick's Landing and Menthis.": "杜拉与塔维克岛和曼西斯相连。",

	"Menthis is connected to Tavick's Landing, Dura, and Central.": "Menthis与Tavick's Landing、Dura和Central相连。",
	"Northedge is connected to Central and Tavick's Landing.": "Northedge与Central和Tavick's Landing相连。",
	"Traveling from district to district involves the use of bridges and ramps, along with magic lifts—vast floating disks that slowly ascend and descend along threads of mystical energy. Lifts are mainly used to move cargo and can be up to 30 feet in diameter. Most lifts have rails but aren't fully enclosed; if combatants fight on a lift, someone falling or being pushed off the edge is always a possibility.": "从一个区到另一个区的旅行需要使用桥梁和坡道，以及魔法电梯--巨大的漂浮盘，沿着神秘能量的线缓慢上升和下降。电梯主要用于运输货物，直径可达30英尺。大多数升降机都有轨道，但不是完全封闭的；如果战斗人员在升降机上战斗，有人掉下来或被推下边缘总是有可能的。",
	"For a speedier journey through the streets, House Orien manages a system of carriages for hire. Taking an Orien carriage cuts travel time in half and costs 2 cp per ward traveled. Flight is, of course, the fastest way to get around in Sharn, cutting travel time down to one-sixth of the walking pace (5 minutes per ward). It's also more expensive, at 2 sp per ward. The most common form of aerial transport is the skycoach, but many flying mounts, including {@creature Hippogriff||hippogriffs}, {@creature Griffon||griffons}, {@creature Pteranodon||pteranodons}, and {@creature Giant Owl||giant owls}, can be found for hire around the city.": "为了更快地穿越街道，奥瑞恩家族管理着一个出租马车系统。乘坐奥瑞恩的马车可以将旅行时间缩短一半，每走一个区需要花费2cp。当然，飞行是在沙恩旅行的最快方式，将旅行时间缩短到步行速度的六分之一（每区5分钟）。它也更昂贵，每区2斯皮尔。最常见的空中交通方式是空中巴士，但许多飞行坐骑，包括{@creature Hippogriff||hippogriffs}、{@creature Griffon||griffons}、{@creature Pteranodon||pteranodons}和{@creature Giant Owl||giant owls}，都可以在城市里找到出租。",

What citizen of Sharn doesn't have an opinion about the fate of Lord Dalian ir'Tain, lost at sea a decade ago? Many are sure that he's a prisoner of the sahuagin, which would explain why Lady Celyria has been funding expeditions into the sahuagin realms.

In fact, when the Tains built their mansion on Skyway, they ordered the architects to design a banquet hall that would seat sixty families and their servants. The original Sixty Families were those that received standing invitations to the first Tain Gala. Though the list has remained generally stable through the years, just last year Celyria expelled the ir'Moros family and gave their place to Saiden Boromar—a surprising advancement for a family that began as Cliffside hooligans.": "伊尔泰恩的财富与塔楼之城息息相关。泰恩的黄金资助了沙恩许多塔楼的建设，而且该家族拥有城市的大片土地。你可能听说过沙恩的60个家族，他们被认为是这个城市的指路明灯。大多数人认为，这些发光体是古老而成熟的，他们的地位与皇家法令相联系。事实上，当泰恩家族在Skyway建造他们的豪宅时，他们命令建筑师设计一个可以容纳60个家庭及其仆人的宴会厅。最初的60个家庭是那些收到第一届泰恩晚宴长期邀请的家庭。虽然这些年来名单基本保持稳定，但就在去年，塞利利亚驱逐了伊尔莫罗斯家族，并将他们的位置让给了赛登-博洛玛--对于一个以悬崖边流氓起家的家族来说，这是一个令人惊讶的进步。",

There's no such person on the rolls of the bardic colleges of Breland, and House Phiarlan and House Thuranni claim to know nothing about her. Syara shuns the spotlight and refuses all interviews. While her works are being debated and celebrated in classrooms and taverns, the artist spends her days in the dingy back rooms of the Diamond Theater. This seclusion has led to a number of fanciful rumors. Some say Syara fought in the Last War and that she was in Metrol on the Day of Mourning. A wilder rumor maintains that she is an exile from the Faerie Court of Thelanis, an archfey bound to human form.": "负责这些激动人心的故事的钻石剧院的剧作家是谁？她的名字叫卢卡-西拉，但除此之外，她还是个谜。布雷兰德的吟游诗人学院的名册上没有这个人，皮亚伦家族和瑟兰尼家族也声称对她一无所知。西拉回避聚光灯，拒绝所有的采访。当她的作品在教室和酒馆里被争论和赞美时，这位艺术家却在钻石剧院喧闹的密室里度过了她的日子。这种隐居生活导致了一些令人遐想的传言。有人说茜拉参加了最后一次战争，她在哀悼日时在梅托尔。一个更疯狂的传言认为，她是一个来自Thelanis精灵法庭的流亡者，一个被束缚在人形上的大法师。",
	"While we wait for answers to this mystery, we encourage you to sample Syara's latest work. {@i Five Lives} is a gutwrenching tragedy that forces us to look at our darkest hours, and to consider the suffering of our enemies and the common threads that unite us all.

	"Shae Lias is arguably the most remarkable district of Upper Northedge. Its population is largely composed of elves, and it is a bastion of Aereni culture and traditions. The heart of Shae Lias is the Gates of Passage, a grand structure that is both the Aereni embassy and a temple to the Undying Court. The priests of the Undying Court don't share this information with outsiders, but many residents believe that an actual member of the Court—an ancient undead elf possessing vast knowledge and divine power—resides in the temple.": "Shae Lias可以说是上Northedge最杰出的地区。它的人口主要由精灵组成，是艾瑞尼文化和传统的一个堡垒。Shae Lias的中心是通道之门，它是一个宏伟的建筑，既是Aereni的大使馆，也是不死之庭的庙宇。不死之庭的祭司们不与外人分享这一信息，但许多居民相信，不死之庭的真正成员--一个拥有丰富知识和神力的古老的不死精灵--就住在这座庙里。",
	"Other points of interest in Shae Lias include the Oaks, one of the finest restaurants in Sharn, which serves food of the highest quality (and priced accordingly). The Veil of Flesh specializes in Aereni body art, in the form of both traditional tattoos and temporary illusions woven directly into the skin. The business known as Nightshade might be the most unusual watering hole in Sharn, doubling as apothecary and tavern; the house specialty is beverages tainted with weak poisons, designed to take the imbiber to the very edge of death.": "沙伊利亚斯的其他景点包括橡树餐厅，它是沙恩最好的餐厅之一，提供最高质量的食物（价格也是如此）。肉体的面纱 \"专门从事艾瑞尼的人体艺术，其形式包括传统的纹身和直接编织在皮肤上的临时幻觉。被称为 \"夜来香 \"的企业可能是沙恩最不寻常的饮品店，它既是药房又是酒馆；它的特色是用弱毒调制的饮料，旨在将饮用者带到死亡的边缘。",

	"High Hope is a temple district; although the city's most impressive churches and shrines are located in Upper Central, it's commonly known that if you're looking for a truly devoted priest, you should go to High Hope. The most notable feature of the district is Daca's Watch. Twelve feet high, this pillar is thought to have once held a statue or monument. Over a century ago, a gnome named Daca climbed atop the pedastal. She has remained there ever since, and shouts advice to anyone who passes by. Although Daca doesn't claim to be a priest, the people of the community say that she's blessed by the god Boldrei and speaks with the Sovereign's voice. True or not, Daca's advice has proven to be remarkably sound, and she and her pillar have become a tourist attraction.": "高希望区是一个神庙区；尽管该市最令人印象深刻的教堂和神庙位于上中央区，但人们普遍知道，如果你要找一个真正虔诚的牧师，你应该去高希望区。该区最引人注目的地方是达卡的守望。这根柱子有12英尺高，人们认为它曾经是一座雕像或纪念碑。一个多世纪以前，一个名叫达卡的地精爬上了这个基座的顶端。从那时起，她就一直呆在那里，并向任何经过的人喊话。虽然达卡并不声称自己是牧师，但社区的人们说她受到波德莱神的祝福，并以圣主的声音说话。无论真假，达卡的建议被证明是非常正确的，她和她的柱子已经成为一个旅游景点。",
	"Although it's poverty-stricken, Lower Northedge is a significant step up from the slums of Lower Dura.

	"Lower Northedge has a significant shifter population. The Rat's Nest is a tavern that caters to shifters, and the Bear's Rest is an inn run by a family of shifters.

	"The Shrine of Fathen the Martyr is an infamous spot in North Market. It is dedicated to a crusading priest of the Silver Flame who uncovered a group of wererats in the early days of Sharn. Fathen was torn apart by the wererats he had exposed, and in his honor the Church of the Silver Flame raised the shrine on this site. It's said that any lycanthrope that enters the shrine will be forced into its true form. Pilgrims devoted to the Silver Flame come from across Khorvaire to pray at the shrine, but the local shifter population has no love for the pilgrims or the church.": "殉道者法特恩神殿是北市场一个臭名昭著的地方。它是为了纪念一位银色火焰的十字军牧师，他在沙恩的早期揭发了一群狼人。法坦被他揭发的狼人撕碎了，为了纪念他，银焰教会在这里建立了神龛。据说，任何进入神殿的狼人都会被强迫变成它的真实形态。致力于银色火焰的朝圣者从霍尔韦尔各地来到神殿祈祷，但当地的变种人对朝圣者和教会都没有爱。",

	"{@b Find a patron}. Many eccentric nobles make their homes in Upper Northedge. A patron of the arts could take an interest in the career of a bard or an entertainer.

You never know what benefits a patron will provide; at the very least, having a patron can provide you with an introduction to high society.": "{@b Find a patron}. 许多古怪的贵族把家安在上诺特赫奇。艺术赞助人可能对吟游诗人或艺人的职业感兴趣。一个收藏家可能会保留有能力的冒险家，因为他们会提供他们在旅行中遇到的任何达卡尼文物。你永远不知道赞助人会提供什么好处；至少，拥有一个赞助人可以为你提供一个进入上流社会的介绍。",
	"Everyone who comes to Sharn, whether by land or air, passes through Tavick's Landing. The quarter took on a martial aspect during the Last War, and the tense atmosphere can still be felt today. On the positive side, Watch Commander Iyanna ir'Talan has gone to great efforts to purge corruption in the local garrisons of the Sharn Watch; as a result, this is one of the few districts where the Watch is both helpful and competent. On the downside, visitors from any nation that fought against Breland during the war might be greeted with suspicion or hostility.": "每一个来到沙恩的人，无论是陆路还是空中，都要经过塔维克的地盘。在最后一次战争期间，这一带呈现出军事化的特点，至今仍可感受到紧张的气氛。积极的一面是，守望先锋伊安娜-伊尔塔兰（Iyanna ir'Talan）为清除沙恩守望的当地驻军中的腐败现象做出了巨大努力；因此，这里是少数几个守望既能提供帮助又有能力的地区之一。相反，来自任何在战争期间与布雷兰德作战的国家的访客可能会受到怀疑或敌视。",

Anyone in contempt of this law is escorted out.": "另一项法律要求居民的着装 \"要能维护这个骄傲的区的庄严尊严\"。徽章和看守所官员可以选择他们如何解释这一点。通常情况下，除非你与迪尼斯家族或沙恩观察站有联系，或者你曾在布莱里什的军队中服役，否则盔甲被认为是不合适的。任何蔑视这一法律的人都会被护送出去。",
	"Any sort of unruly behavior—fighting, shouting in the streets, and the like—brings a fine of up to 5 gp and temporary expulsion from the ward.": "任何不守规矩的行为--打架、在街上大喊大叫等等--都会被处以最高5戈比的罚款，并被暂时驱逐出病房。",
	"Unlike the upper ward, Middle Tavick's Landing welcomes travelers and tourists. The ward features a host of lively taverns and excellent inns. The Cornerstone is a huge arena that hosts events ranging from circuses to aerial jousting. The Deathsgate district caters to adventurers, much as the Clifftop district of Upper Dura does. Like Clifftop, the district has an adventurer's guild—though the Deathsgate Guild has a dark reputation, and its members often pick fights with Clifftop adventurers. (See the \"{@book Adventurer's Guilds|ERLW|8|Adventurer's Guilds}\" section for more information.) House Jorasco has a large house of healing in the ward, and House Deneith maintains a recruiting station for would-be mercenaries.": "与上区不同的是，中塔维克的兰亭欢迎旅行者和游客。该区有许多热闹的酒馆和优秀的旅店。角石是一个巨大的竞技场，举办从马戏团到空中比武的各种活动。死亡之门区迎合了冒险家的需求，就像上杜拉的克利夫托普区一样。和克里夫托普一样，该区也有一个冒险者公会--尽管死亡之门公会有着黑暗的名声，其成员经常与克里夫托普的冒险者发生争执。(更多信息见\"{@book Adventurer's Guilds|ERLW|8|Adventurer's Guilds} \"部分）。乔拉斯科（Jorasco）家族在病房里有一个大型的治疗室，迪尼斯（Deneith）家族则为未来的雇佣兵设立了一个招募站。",
	"The Graystone district has deep roots in Karrnathi culture that predate the Last War; Slogar's and the Bloody Mug are places where homesick Karrns can enjoy blood sausage and Nightwood ale. The district is a haven for Karrnathi soldiers who want to avoid Brelish aggression and a place where followers of the Blood of Vol can practice their faith.": "灰石区在最后一次战争之前就已经深深扎根于卡尔纳提文化；斯洛加和血腥杯是思乡的卡尔人可以享受血肠和夜林啤酒的地方。该区是希望避免布雷利什侵略的卡尔纳提士兵的天堂，也是沃尔之血的信徒们可以实践其信仰的地方。",
	"Tavick's Market is one of Sharn's major market districts; located directly above the Terminus lightning rail station, it's filled with stands selling produce and goods brought in by local farmers.": "塔维克市场是沙恩的主要市场区之一；位于总站闪电铁路站的正上方，到处都是销售当地农民带来的农产品和商品的摊位。",
	"Two land routes to Sharn both end at Lower Tavick's Landing. The Orien lightning rail deposits passengers in the district of Terminus, while those who travel to Sharn on the Old Road arrive at Wroann's Gate. Getting to the better parts of Sharn from here means passing through Black Arch, a heavily fortified garrison district designed to repel enemies and withstand a full siege. The ward offers a variety of services catering to travelers; the Dragoneyes district is a maze of taverns, inns, brothels, and gambling halls. Dragoneyes is also noteworthy for being the site of one of the few changeling communities in Breland.": "两条通往沙恩的陆路路线都以下塔维克岛为终点。奥瑞恩闪电铁路将乘客安置在终点站地区，而那些通过旧路前往沙恩的人则到达了Wroann的大门。从这里去往沙恩更好的地方意味着要经过黑拱门，这是一个重兵把守的驻军区，旨在击退敌人并抵御全面围攻。该区提供各种迎合旅行者的服务；Dragoneyes区是一个由酒馆、旅店、妓院和赌博厅组成的迷宫。龙眼区也是值得注意的，因为它是布雷兰德为数不多的变种人社区之一。",
	"House Orien has a strong presence in Lower Tavick's Landing, and Orien heirs, laborers, and teamsters can be found in many of the districts. House Lyrandar and House Deneith are also well represented, with their representatives arranging matters of trade, transport, and security.": "奥瑞恩家族在下塔维克城有很强的影响力，在许多地区都能找到奥瑞恩的继承人、劳工和团队成员。Lyrandar家族和Deneith家族也有很好的代表，他们的代表负责安排贸易、运输和安全事宜。",
	"These days, Lower Tavick's Landing is best known for High Walls, a former residential district converted into a home for refugees from the Last War. High Walls is filled past capacity, mostly by Cyrans who were displaced by the Mourning. The gates are open at present, but High Walls is designed to serve as a fortress prison if the need arises, and the Sharn Watch keeps an eye out for any signs of unrest.": "这些天来，下塔维克登陆区最出名的是高墙（High Walls），一个以前的住宅区被改造成了最后一次战争的难民之家。高墙的容量已经满了，大部分是因哀悼而流离失所的赛伦人。大门目前是开放的，但高墙的设计是为了在需要时作为一个要塞监狱，而且沙恩守望者一直在注意任何动乱的迹象。",
	"In the wake of the Mourning, our king welcomed the survivors of that tragedy into our cities. In Sharn, High Walls alone holds more Cyran refugees than Karrnath has allowed across its borders. If you read the Sharn Inquisitive or the Korranberg Chronicle, you've heard the endless litany of how difficult life is, tales of overcrowding, starvation, and disease. Although we at the Voice of Breland sympathize with all who suffer, we refuse to ignore the deadly threat in our midst. The majority of Cyrans who survived the Mourning did so because they were beyond the borders of their nation. And why is that? Because they were soldiers.": "在哀悼事件之后，我们的国王欢迎那场悲剧的幸存者进入我们的城市。在沙恩，仅高墙一地容纳的赛伦难民就比卡尔纳特允许越过其边界的人数多。如果你读过《沙恩探究者》或《科兰博格纪事》，你就会听到关于生活有多困难的无休止的传闻，关于过度拥挤、饥饿和疾病的故事。尽管我们布雷兰德之声同情所有受苦的人，但我们拒绝忽视我们中间的致命威胁。大多数在哀悼会上幸存下来的锡兰人是因为他们在他们国家的边界之外。而这是为什么呢？因为他们是军人。",
	"The Sharn Inquisitive talks about starving children and ailing peasants, but it doesn't mention the Cyran special forces and elite war mages who now reside in High Walls. As Brelish, we all want to show compassion to the truly innocent, but let us never forget that these people were once our enemy and could be again. And let us also remember that the cause of the Mourning remains a mystery. Was it divine punishment for Cyran sins that have yet to be washed clean? Or could it have been a premature activation of an arcane weapon—and if so, could Cyran artificers already be working on an improved version in the heart of our greatest city?": "沙恩探询者》谈到了饥饿的儿童和生病的农民，但它没有提到现在居住在高墙的赛伦特种部队和精英战争法师。作为布雷利什人，我们都想对真正无辜的人表示同情，但让我们永远不要忘记，这些人曾经是我们的敌人，也可能再次成为敌人。让我们也记住，哀悼的原因仍然是个谜。它是对尚未被洗净的Cyran罪孽的神圣惩罚吗？或者，它可能是一种神秘武器的过早激活--如果是这样，赛伦的工匠们会不会已经在我们最伟大的城市中心研究出一个改进版？",
	"Remain alert, people of Breland! Don't let the current plight of these unfortunates blind you to the danger!": "保持警惕，布雷兰德的人们！不要让这些不幸的人目前的困境蒙蔽了你们的眼睛。不要让这些不幸的人目前的困境蒙蔽了你的眼睛，让你看不到危险!",
	"As a metropolitan district filled with immigrants, merchants, and travelers from across Khorvaire and beyond it, Tavick's Landing offers a host of opportunities to enjoy food and entertainment from distant lands. Or you might find yourself here for one of a few specific reasons, such as:": "作为一个充满移民、商人和来自霍尔韦尔各地及其他地区的旅行者的大都会区，塔维克城提供了大量的机会来享受来自远方的食物和娱乐。或者你可能因为一些特定的原因而发现自己在这里，比如说。",
	"{@b Take a chance}. The Dragoneyes district is filled with ways to lose your wages, both in established gambling halls and on street corners. If you you're looking for something a little more exotic, see if you can find Chance. This is the name both of a secret, roaming gambling den and of the changeling who runs it. In addition to offering all manner of mundane games and bets, Chance is said to be able to arrange and cover nearly any sort of wager or duel. Are you ready to gamble with a fiend? Would you wager a year of your life for a moment of good fortune when you need it the most? If any of the rumors are true, these are examples of what's possible at Chance.": "{@b Take a chance}. 龙眼区充满了输掉工资的方法，无论是在成熟的赌博厅还是在街头巷尾。如果你想找一些更奇特的东西，看看你是否能找到 \"机会\"。这既是一个秘密的、流动的赌馆的名字，也是经营这个赌馆的变种人的名字。除了提供各种平凡的游戏和赌注外，据说机会还能够安排和涵盖几乎所有种类的赌注或决斗。你准备好和一个恶魔赌博了吗？你愿意用你一年的生命作赌注，在你最需要的时候换取一时的好运吗？如果有任何传言是真的，这些都是在《机会》中可能出现的例子。",
	"{@b Find refuge}. Though most of the refugees in High Walls come from Cyre, the district is a haven for anyone displaced in the war, including Brelish. The place is overcrowded, however, and resources are stretched thin. Tensions are high, and feuds and power struggles among the refugees take place regularly. If you're from Cyre, you might be able to find a cot in High Walls, especially if you already have friends or family living there.": "{@b Find refuge}. 虽然高墙区的大部分难民来自赛尔，但该区是任何在战争中流离失所的人的避难所，包括布雷利什。然而，这个地方人满为患，资源也捉襟见肘。难民之间的关系很紧张，经常发生争斗和权力斗争。如果你来自赛尔，你也许能在高墙找到一张小床，特别是如果你已经有朋友或家人住在那里。",
	"{@b Bond over blood}. The Graystone district in Middle Tavick's Landing is one of the few places in Breland where the Blood of Vol religion is practiced openly. Residents are circumspect about their activities, and undead servants are largely kept off the streets. But if you're a follower of the faith, it's a place where you can participate in the Sacrament of the Blood or consult with a priest. It's also the best place to find a skilled necromancer, or to hear rumors about the latest schemes of the Order of the Emerald Claw.": "{@b Bond over blood}. 中塔维克城的灰石区是布雷兰德为数不多的公开信奉沃尔之血宗教的地方之一。居民们对自己的活动都很谨慎，不死的仆人也基本上不在街上出现。但如果你是该信仰的追随者，你可以在这里参加血之圣礼或向牧师咨询。这里也是寻找熟练的死灵法师的最好地方，或者听到关于翡翠之爪骑士团最新计划的传闻。",
	"The five main quarters of Sharn make up the bulk of the city. But a few additional districts lie above and below the metropolis proper, including wondrous sites and dangerous places that most folk prefer to avoid.": "沙恩的五个主要区构成了城市的大部分。但还有一些额外的地区位于大都市的上方和下方，包括大多数人喜欢避开的奇妙地点和危险场所。",

The food isn't incredible, but tourist crowds keep the Vista filled with customers.": "这家富有传奇色彩的餐厅是由天路市的市议员艾维克斯-伊尔-玛拉莎女士拥有的。地板上镶嵌着水晶窗，让食客可以俯视下面的城市。这里的食物并不令人难以置信，但旅游人群让Vista餐厅充满了顾客。",
	"The Cloud Dragon": "云龙",
	"This restaurant serves traditional Brelish cuisine, and it does so exceptionally well. It's rarely as crowded as the other venues in Skyway, but locals know its value.": "这家餐厅提供传统的布雷利什美食，而且做得特别好。它很少像天路的其他场所那样拥挤，但当地人知道它的价值。",

	"Mud Caves": "泥浆洞",

It's a wretched existence, but most of the inhabitants have no other options. It also makes an excellent hiding place for fugitives.": "这个棚户区位于悬崖边上，一代又一代的穷苦人在悬崖壁上开辟了家园。这是一种悲惨的生活，但大多数居民没有其他选择。这里也是逃亡者的绝佳藏身之处。",
	"Sharn's Welcome": "沙恩的欢迎",
	"Also known as the docks of Cliffside, this area is rough and dirty. Its taverns frequently host brawls, while the inns offer travelers a wide variety of ways to be cheated or robbed.": "这个地区也被称为悬崖边的码头，是一个粗糙和肮脏的地方。它的酒馆经常举办争吵，而旅馆则为旅行者提供了各种被欺骗或抢劫的方式。",
	"Ship's Towers": "船上的塔楼",
	"Drifting alongside the Cliffside docks is a collection of rafts, ships, and houseboats lashed together to form a floating community.": "漂浮在悬崖边码头的是一批木筏、船只和船屋，它们被绑在一起，形成一个漂浮的社区。",
	"Keldoran Forge": "克尔多兰锻造厂",
	"Though most of the foundries in the Cogs are devoted to large-scale industry, the dwarf Antos Keldoran maintains a small forge and produces bespoke arms and armor.": "虽然Cogs的大多数铸造厂都致力于大型工业，但矮人安托斯-凯尔多兰（Antos Keldoran）保持着一个小型锻造厂，生产定制的武器和盔甲。",

	"A small temple in the Blackbones district holds a pool said to be blessed by the god Onatar. Smiths come from across Khorvaire to dip their tools in the pool.": "黑骨区的一座小庙里有一个水池，据说是受到奥纳塔神的祝福。铁匠们从霍尔韦尔各地赶来，将他们的工具浸入池中。",

	"A number of floating towers drift above the upper wards of Sharn, but these are dwarfed by Skyway, an entire district suspended above and between Central Plateau and Menthis Plateau. Built on an island of solidified cloud, Skyway holds the mansions of the wealthiest people in Khorvaire—nobles whose feet never touch the ground. It's a realm of wonders, filled with the finest examples of luxury and extravagance that gold can buy and magic can produce. For instance, Cloudpool Park is formed from sculpted cloudstuff, with window panels of ice that provide a view of the city below.": "一些浮动的塔楼漂浮在沙恩的上层区，但这些塔楼与天路相比相形见绌，天路是一个悬浮在中央高原和Menthis高原之间的整个地区。天空之路建立在一个凝固的云岛上，拥有霍尔韦尔最富有的人的豪宅--那些脚不沾地的贵族。这是一个奇迹的领域，充满了黄金可以买到的和魔法可以产生的最好的豪华和奢侈的例子。例如，云池公园是由雕刻的云层形成的，有冰窗板，可以看到下面的城市。",
	"This district offers the highest-priced services in the city. The Dragon's Hoard is a Ghallanda resort, where travelers can enjoy the utmost in luxury if they can afford the most expensive amenities. The Celestial Vista and the Cloud Dragon are wondrous restaurants. The Azure Gateway is a new hotel and restaurant that has replaced a Ghallanda establishment. The owner has remained anonymous, and this touch of mystery has piqued interest in the place.": "这个区提供城市中价格最高的服务。龙之囤是一个加兰达度假村，如果旅客能负担得起最昂贵的设施，就能享受到最豪华的服务。The Celestial Vista和云龙餐厅是奇妙的餐厅。蔚蓝之门是一家新的酒店和餐厅，取代了加兰达的一个机构。老板一直是匿名的，这种神秘感引起了人们对这个地方的兴趣。",

	"Cliffside encompasses the docks and waterfront of Sharn, running along the edge of the Dagger River and up the cliff above it. Massive lifts levitate goods up to the skydocks in the district of Precarious. The area's rough and poor, filled with sailors and dockworkers. Many of these boisterous folk love the life in Cliffside; as a common saying goes, \"Better a tankard of ale in Cliffside than a barrel of Central wine.\"": "悬崖边包括了沙恩的码头和滨水区，沿着匕首河的边缘和上面的悬崖延伸。巨大的升降机将货物漂浮到岌岌可危区的空中码头上。这个地区粗糙而贫穷，到处是水手和码头工人。这些人中的许多人都喜欢崖边的生活；正如一句俗语所说，\"在崖边喝一罐啤酒比喝一桶中央酒更好\"。",
	"Plenty of legitimate services can be found here—ships need supplies and repairs, goods need to be stored, captains need to hire crew, and sailors need a dry bed to sleep in once in a while—but other businesses meet different kinds of demands.

	"Even though the Sharn Watch has a token presence here, Cliffside remains one of the most crime-ridden districts in the city.

In fact, the sahuagin rarely initiate violence, but there have been clashes between them and aggressive, drunken sailors.": "尽管沙恩观察站在这里有象征性的存在，悬崖边仍然是城市中犯罪率最高的地区之一。这种情况由于萨瓦金人的存在而变得更加严重，他们作为向导出售自己的服务，帮助前往Xen'drik的船只。事实上，萨瓦金人很少发起暴力，但他们与好斗的醉酒水手之间曾发生过冲突。",
	"The Cogs lie deep beneath Sharn, below the sewers and Old Sharn (described later in this chapter). Streams of Fernian lava flow through this area, and over the centuries, House Cannith has helped Breland establish vast foundries that tap this mystic resource. Ashblack and Blackbones are industrial districts, largely inhabited by warforged laborers and miserable workers of other races. It is said that House Cannith maintains a forgehold in the Ashblack district, and that this is where Baron Merrix d'Cannith conducts his experiments.": "Cogs位于沙恩的地下深处，在下水道和旧沙恩（本章后面有描述）之下。费尔尼安熔岩流经这一地区，几个世纪以来，坎尼斯家族帮助布雷兰德建立了巨大的铸造厂，开采这一神秘的资源。灰黑（Ashblack）和黑骨（Blackbones）是工业区，主要居住着战争锻造的劳工和其他种族的悲惨的工人。据说坎尼斯家族在灰黑区有一个锻造厂，而这也是梅里克斯-坎尼斯男爵进行实验的地方。",
	"The Sharn Watch maintains a presence in the Cogs, and overseers from House Cannith are stationed here to keep things in order. Beyond these industrial districts lies the deeper tunnels of Khyber's Gate, a tenement district.": "沙恩观察站在Cogs保持了一定的影响力，坎尼斯家族的监督员也驻扎在这里，以维持秩序。在这些工业区之外，是开伯尔之门（Khyber's Gate）的更深的隧道，这是一个租界区。",
	"Blackbones has a number of remarkable locations. For example, the Pool of Onatar's Tears is sacred to the Sovereign of the Forge. The current caretaker is a warforged priest named Smith, who believes that Onatar has plans for the warforged, and that the warforged and creatures of flesh are meant to live together.": "布莱克本斯有许多了不起的地方。例如，奥纳塔的眼泪之池是锻造之君的圣地。目前的看守人是一位名叫史密斯的战神牧师，他相信奥纳塔为战神制定了计划，而且战神和肉体的生物注定要生活在一起。",
	"Most of the citizens of Sharn have never been to the Cogs. The area does house the bulk of the city's warforged population, and if you're looking for a particular warforged, it's the best place to start. Industrial espionage and labor struggles can add drama to adventures in the great foundries, not to mention the possibility of artificers with secret forges hidden in the Cogs.": "大多数沙恩的市民都没有去过Cogs。这个地区确实容纳了城市中大部分的战争锻造者，如果你在寻找一个特定的战争锻造者，这里是最好的起点。工业间谍和劳工斗争可以为大铸造厂的冒险增加戏剧性，更不用说可能会有工匠在齿轮箱中隐藏秘密的锻造。",
	"Sharn boasts countless opportunities for adventurers. You can get caught up in espionage in Upper Central or drawn into a crime war in Lower Dura. Aside from the intrigues and politics of the city, Sharn has a wide range of cursed ruins, haunted slums, shunned catacombs, and other dangerous places. Wise folk avoid these areas, but those whose hunger for adventure outweighs their good sense might do the opposite.": "沙恩为冒险者提供了无数的机会。你可以在上中部陷入间谍活动，也可以被卷入下杜拉的犯罪战争中。除了城市的阴谋和政治之外，沙恩还有各种被诅咒的废墟、闹鬼的贫民窟、避之不及的地下墓穴和其他危险的地方。明智的人们会避开这些地方，但那些对冒险的渴望超过了他们的理智的人可能会做出相反的选择。",
	"Look to the cliffs to the north of Sharn, and you'll see a collection of crypts embedded into the cliff face. This is the City of the Dead, the final resting place of the wealthiest citizens of Sharn. Common folk are cremated after death, but members of the Sixty Families and others with sufficient wealth have their remains interred in the tombs and tunnels of this necropolis.": "向沙恩北部的悬崖看去，你会看到嵌在崖壁上的一系列墓穴。这是死者之城，是沙恩最富有的公民的最后安息之地。普通人死后会被火化，但60个家族的成员和其他拥有足够财富的人将他们的遗体埋葬在这座死城的墓穴和隧道里。",
	"Few people reside in this area. Among its major features are Aureon's Holt, a temple of the Restful Watch, where Sovereign priests conduct funerals and serve as the caretakers of the tombs. Warden Tower is an outpost of the Church of the Silver Flame, staffed by a single hermit tasked to watch for supernatural threats.": "很少有人居住在这个地区。它的主要特点是奥瑞恩的霍尔特，这是一座安息守望的神庙，主权牧师在这里主持葬礼并担任坟墓的看守人。典狱长塔是银焰教会的前哨，由一名隐士负责监视超自然的威胁。",
	"Though the City of the Dead is largely peaceful, stories circulate about dark powers lurking there. Some parents warn their children of the Lich-Priest Gath, who steals disobedient children and forces them to work in his kingdom of the dead, polishing the bones of his skeletal subjects.": "虽然死亡之城在很大程度上是和平的，但流传着关于那里潜伏着黑暗力量的故事。一些父母警告他们的孩子，巫师加思偷走了不听话的孩子，强迫他们在他的死亡王国里工作，为他的骷髅臣民打磨骨头。",
	"Sharn was built on the foundations of an older city, which was itself built atop goblin ruins. This old city was destroyed by dark magic, courtesy of the elemental powers of the infamous Halas Tarkanan and his consort, the Lady of the Plague. It is said that vile powers still linger in these ruins, and for this reason King Galifar I had all the passages to this undercity sealed with gates of metal and magic. These portals remain sealed today, and it's illegal to tamper with them. But it's generally assumed that many treasures are hidden in the ruins of Old Sharn, along with untold secrets of the past.": "沙恩建立在一个古老城市的基础上，而这个城市本身就是建立在地精的废墟之上。这座古老的城市被黑暗的魔法摧毁了，由臭名昭著的哈拉斯-塔卡南和他的妃子--瘟疫之女的元素力量提供。据说邪恶的力量仍然在这些废墟中徘徊，为此加利法尔一世国王用金属和魔法之门封住了通往这座地下城市的所有通道。这些门户至今仍被封存，篡改它们是非法的。但人们普遍认为，旧沙恩的废墟中隐藏着许多宝藏，以及过去难以言喻的秘密。",
	"No one knows exactly what lurks in Old Sharn. The ruins could contain ghosts or other undead, the vengeful spirits of the aberrant-marked people who took refuge in the fallen city. In olden times, the Lady of the Plague had power over vermin and disease, and a fanciful tale says that even today the undercity is inhabited by swarms of sentient rats and beetles.": "没有人确切地知道在旧沙恩潜伏着什么。废墟中可能有鬼魂或其他亡灵，是那些在堕落的城市中避难的有反常标记的人的复仇之魂。在古代，瘟疫女士拥有控制害虫和疾病的力量，一个奇特的故事说，即使在今天，这个城市的地下仍然居住着成群的有生命的老鼠和甲虫。",
	"You'll hear warning bells toll tomorrow morning. You'll see packs of people with their faces hidden by plague masks or strips of cloth. Jorasco healers will roam the streets offering free examinations and blessings. If you're new to Sharn, have no fear! This isn't the outbreak of disease it appears to be; it's how Sharn observes the Lady's Day, commemorating a tragic incident in our past.": "明天早上你会听到警告的钟声。你会看到成群结队的人，他们的脸被瘟疫面具或布条遮住。乔拉斯科治疗师将在街上游荡，提供免费检查和祝福。如果你是新来的沙恩人，不要害怕！这不是爆发瘟疫。这并不是表面上的疾病爆发；这是沙恩纪念女士节的方式，纪念我们过去的一个悲惨事件。",
	"Today, aberrant dragonmarks are rare. But there was a time long ago when they were far more common. An army of aberrant heirs made their home here in the early days of Sharn, led by Halas Tarkanan—known as the Earthshaker—and the Lady of the Plague, who had power over vermin and disease. When the dragonmarked houses laid siege to the city and their defeat became inevitable, the two unleashed their full might. Tarkanan's power reduced the early towers to rubble, and the Lady of the Plague called forth a horde of disease-infested vermin.": "今天，反常的龙纹是罕见的。但在很久之前，它们曾有过一段更为普遍的时期。在沙恩的早期，一支由反常继承人组成的军队在这里安家，领头的是被称为 \"撼地者 \"的哈拉斯-塔卡南，以及拥有控制害虫和疾病能力的 \"瘟疫女士\"。当龙纹屋围攻城市，他们的失败变得不可避免时，两人释放了他们的全部力量。塔卡南的力量将早期的塔楼变成了废墟，而瘟疫女士则召唤出了一大群疾病缠身的害虫。",
	"For centuries afterward, the region was shunned. When our modern city was built, the cursed ruins were sealed away. But one never knows when the darkness could rise up again. On the Lady's Day, we remember the tragedy that once befell Sharn, and we prepare for the possibility that it could happen again.": "在之后的几个世纪里，这个地区被避开了。当我们的现代城市建成后，被诅咒的废墟被封存起来。但人们永远不知道黑暗何时会再次兴起。在女士节，我们纪念曾经降临在沙恩身上的悲剧，并为它可能再次发生做好准备。",
	"The Fallen district in Lower Dura was once known as Godsgate. When the first towers were raised, Godsgate was the temple district. It had shrines and statues dedicated to the Sovereigns, a proud church of the Silver Flame, even a monument to the Undying Court. But as Sharn grew and prospered, religious services were moved to grander temples in the upper wards. Godsgate became a tenement district, and the shrines and monuments were forgotten and left to decay. The final blow to this once-proud district came early in the Last War. A team of Aundairian saboteurs brought down one of Sharn's floating towers, and the falling spire struck Godsgate. Buildings collapsed, and hundreds died. Untended corpses led to infection and disease. The City Council had no interest in sinking gold into Lower Dura to restore the area, and the district was abandoned.": "下杜拉的堕落区曾被称为神门。当第一座塔楼升起时，神门是神庙区。它有献给君主的神龛和雕像，有骄傲的银色火焰教堂，甚至还有一座不朽法庭的纪念碑。但随着沙恩的发展和繁荣，宗教仪式被转移到上层区的更大的寺庙。神门成为了一个租户区，而神龛和纪念碑则被遗忘，任其腐烂。对这个曾经辉煌的地区的最后一击是在上次战争初期。一队Aundairian破坏者推倒了沙恩的一座浮动塔，坠落的塔尖击中了神门。建筑物倒塌了，数百人死亡。未经处理的尸体导致了感染和疾病。市议会没有兴趣将黄金沉入下杜拉以恢复该地区，该地区被遗弃。",
	"Today, the district known as Fallen is strewn with the rubble of the fallen tower, mingled with shattered buildings and broken statues. Those who venture into Fallen must deal with the Ravers, feral savages that lurk in the shadows. There's no question that the Ravers exist, but their true nature remains a subject of debate. A common hypothesis is that they're the descendants of the original inhabitants of the district, who were possessed and driven mad by the ghosts of those who died when the tower fell. Others claim that House Vadalis has been trying to magebreed super-soldiers, and the Ravers are the result of failed experiments.": "今天，被称为 \"堕落 \"的地区到处都是倒下的塔的废墟，混杂着破碎的建筑和破碎的雕像。那些冒险进入堕落区的人必须对付掠夺者，潜伏在阴影中的野蛮人。掠夺者的存在是毫无疑问的，但他们的真实性质仍然是一个争论的话题。一个常见的假设是，他们是该地区原始居民的后代，他们被塔楼倒塌时死去的人的鬼魂附身并被逼疯。还有人声称，瓦达里斯家族一直在尝试用魔法培育超级士兵，而拉弗尔人是实验失败的结果。",
	"Only the most desperate people live here, and the forces of the law won't come near it. As a result, the district has a lot of space available for any cult or secret society that needs a lair. The followers of a radiant idol, the Cult of the Dragon Below, or any other cabal could lay claim to a shattered church in Fallen.": "只有最绝望的人住在这里，法律的力量不会靠近它。因此，该区有大量的空间可供任何需要巢穴的邪教或秘密团体使用。辐射神像的追随者、龙下之教或任何其他阴谋集团都可以在堕落区的一个破碎的教堂里提出要求。",
	"Beyond the Cogs lies Khyber's Gate, a maze of tunnels and tenements carved into the stone. The Sharn Watch has no presence here, and the closest thing to an authority is the criminal organization known as Daask; if you're seeking the leaders of this group, this is where you'll find them. Many of the inhabitants of the Gate are goblins and immigrants from Droaam, but it's also home to fugitives, war criminals, and other unsavory types.": "在 \"齿轮 \"之外是开伯尔之门，这是一个由刻在石头上的隧道和房舍组成的迷宫。沙恩看守所在这里没有存在感，最接近权威的是被称为Daask的犯罪组织；如果你在寻找这个组织的领导人，你会在这里找到他们。门里的许多居民是地精和来自德拉姆的移民，但这里也是逃犯、战犯和其他不受欢迎的人的家。",
	"Khyber's Gate is part of the ruins of a goblin city that was abandoned thousands of years ago. No one knows how deep it goes. The monstrous inhabitants of the district have no love for treasure hunters or adventurers, and it's a dangerous place to explore.": "开伯尔之门是几千年前被遗弃的地精城市废墟的一部分。没有人知道它有多深。该区的畸形居民不喜欢寻宝者或冒险者，这是一个危险的探索之地。",
	"Shamukaar is the most successful tavern in Khyber's Gate. The place is a safe haven for all within it, regardless of species or politics; once you make it through the door, you can breathe easy.": "沙穆卡是开伯尔之门最成功的酒馆。这个地方对其内的所有人来说都是一个安全的避风港，不管是什么物种或政治；一旦你进了这个门，你就可以轻松地呼吸。",
	"The upper wards of Sharn use a network of chutes to funnel garbage down into the sewers. Refuse and filth is channeled into cavernous midden chambers, where it is left to rot or be devoured by the vermin and oozes that inhabit the sewers. Smaller tunnels channel wastewater into purification centers, where magewrights use magic to cleanse the water. A special unit of the Sharn Watch protects the purification chambers. Beyond these small, vital areas, the sewers are lawless.": "沙恩的上层区使用一个网络滑道将垃圾输送到下水道。垃圾和污秽物被输送到洞穴中，在那里任其腐烂或被居住在下水道中的害虫和渗虫吞噬。较小的隧道将废水导入净化中心，由魔法师使用魔法来净化水。沙恩守望的一支特殊部队保护着净化室。除了这些小而重要的区域，下水道是无法无天的。",
	"Though the sewers were never intended to support a population, over the centuries a subculture has evolved in this region. A few tribes of people—mostly goblins, along with a few shifters, dwarves, and feral halflings—live in the sewers, rummaging through the midden heaps and selling their goods in the lower city. These sewer clans constantly battle over territory, as control of one or more midden chamber can be critical to survival. The sewer clans can pose a threat to adventurers, but they can also be valuable allies; there are no better guides to the sewers and what lies beneath them than one of the folk who live there.": "虽然下水道从来就不是用来支持人口的，但几个世纪以来，在这个地区已经发展出一种亚文化。有几个部落的人--主要是地精，还有一些变异人、矮人和野蛮的半身人--住在下水道里，在禁闭室里翻箱倒柜，在下层城市里卖东西。这些下水道氏族不断地争夺地盘，因为控制一个或多个禁猎室对生存至关重要。下水道氏族可以对冒险者构成威胁，但他们也可以成为有价值的盟友；没有比住在下水道里的人更适合指导下水道及其下面的东西了。",
	"Although crime occurs throughout Sharn, it is most apparent in Lower Dura and the Cogs. The Sharn Watch has a minimal presence in these wards, which are the easiest places to sell stolen goods or to hire an assassin. Of course, they're also good places to get robbed or caught up in a street brawl.": "尽管犯罪在整个沙恩都有发生，但在下杜拉和齿轮区最为明显。沙恩观察站在这些地区的存在感极低，这些地区是最容易出售赃物或雇佣刺客的地方。当然，它们也是被抢劫或被卷入街头斗殴的好地方。",
	"Sharn is home to a large number of minor gangs and independent criminals. Even so, most criminal activities in the city come under the purview of one of four criminal organizations: the Boromar Clan, Daask, House Tarkanan, and the Tyrants. Even independents usually have an arrangement with one of these power groups. If your character has the criminal background, work with the DM to determine which of these organizations you're connected to (the DM has more information about these groups in {@book chapter 4|ERLW|11}).": "沙恩是大量小帮派和独立罪犯的家园。即便如此，这个城市的大多数犯罪活动都属于四个犯罪组织之一的管辖范围：波罗马家族、达斯克、塔卡南家族和暴君。即使是独立的人，也通常与这些权力集团之一有安排。如果你的角色有犯罪背景，请与DM合作，确定你与这些组织中的哪一个有联系（DM在{@book chapter 4|ERLW|11}中有关于这些组织的更多信息）。",
	"The Boromar Clan began as a family of halfling immigrants from the Talenta Plains. Today the Boromars are one of Sharn's most influential families; there's a Boromar on the City Council. Also, the Boromars have close ties by marriage to the local branch of House Jorasco, and clan members can be seen at every Skyway gala.": "波洛玛氏族最初是一个来自塔伦塔平原的半身人移民家庭。今天，波洛玛家族是沙恩最具影响力的家族之一；市议会中就有一名波洛玛人。另外，博罗玛家族与乔拉斯科家族的当地分支有着密切的婚姻关系，在每一次天威盛典上都能看到该家族成员的身影。",
	"The Boromar Clan specializes in gambling, theft, and smuggling. In addition, it governs a wide network of lesser gangs and crime lords across the city. In the past, the clan's reputation was sufficiently strong to prevent any challenges. Over the last decade, however, the Boromars have been fending off a serious challenge from Daask. Those monsters have been aggressively targeting Boromar agents and holdings, and the feud between the two forces grows more heated all the time.": "波洛马氏族专门从事赌博、盗窃和走私活动。此外，它还管辖着整个城市的一个广泛的小型帮派和犯罪头目网络。在过去，该部族的声誉足以阻止任何挑战。然而，在过去的十年里，博罗玛家族一直在抵御来自达斯克的严重挑战。那些怪物一直在积极地针对波罗马人的代理人和财产，两股势力之间的争斗一直在加剧。",
	"Having a connection to the Boromar Clan makes you part of the established power in Sharn. It's an organization that values tradition and prefers to avoid violence. As an associate of the clan, you'll be expected to respect the hierarchy and follow the rules, and you might be targeted by Daask just as if you were a Boromar yourself.": "与博洛玛氏族有联系，使你成为沙恩既定权力的一部分。这是一个重视传统并倾向于避免暴力的组织。作为该家族的一员，你将被要求尊重等级制度并遵守规则，而且你可能会成为达斯克的目标，就像你自己是波罗马人一样。",

	"Founded by monstrous immigrants from Droaam, the criminal organization known as Daask has been building its power for a decade and has recently begun an aggressive campaign of expansion. Daask engages mainly in violent crime, including armed robbery, assault, arson, and murder. As its reputation has grown, it has added extortion to this list.": "由来自德拉姆（Droaam）的畸形移民建立的犯罪组织 \"达斯克\"（Daask）已经建立了十年的力量，最近开始了积极的扩张运动。达斯克主要从事暴力犯罪，包括武装抢劫、殴打、纵火和谋杀。随着其声誉的提高，它又增加了敲诈勒索的内容。",

	"House Tarkanan is an elite force of mercenary thieves and assassins. The criminal talents of the Tarkanans are enhanced by another trait they share: every member of the house possesses an aberrant dragonmark. Thus, every Tarkanan has an unpredictable magical gift—and all of them are united by the fear and prejudice that most aberrant heirs elicit from other people.": "塔卡南家族是一支由雇佣兵小偷和刺客组成的精英部队。塔卡南家族的犯罪才能因他们的另一个共同特征而得到加强：该家族的每个成员都拥有一个反常的龙纹。因此，每个Tarkanan家族都有一个不可预测的魔法天赋--而且他们都被大多数反常继承人引起的恐惧和偏见所团结。",

	"The law is a force to be reckoned with in Sharn. Even in places where the watch is notoriously ineffective, those who would break the law still need to be wary of zealous guards resistant to bribes or threats.": "在沙恩，法律是一种不可忽视的力量。即使是在那些出了名的看守不力的地方，那些想违法的人仍然需要提防那些对贿赂或威胁有抵触情绪的热心守卫。",
	"The members of the King's Citadel are the direct agents of the Brelish Crown. As such, the King's Citadel stands above the Sharn Watch. Its members have the authority to take control of any investigation and to command the service of any guard or sentinel. Typically the Citadel leaves the daily chores of law enforcement (including the conflicts between the criminal organizations of the lower towers) in the hands of the Sharn Watch. The Citadel is concerned with forces that threaten the entire city, or even the kingdom. Foreign spies, mad necromancers, and ancient fiends—these are the foes of the King's Citadel, rather than pickpockets and burglars.": "国王城堡的成员是布雷利什王室的直接代理人。因此，国王城堡的地位高于沙恩守望。其成员有权控制任何调查，并指挥任何警卫或哨兵的服务。通常情况下，城堡将执法的日常琐事（包括下层塔楼的犯罪组织之间的冲突）交给沙恩守望。城堡关注的是那些威胁到整个城市，甚至王国的力量。外国间谍、疯狂的死灵法师和古老的恶魔--这些都是国王城堡的敌人，而不是扒手和窃贼。",
	"Of course, many of these greater threats might be beyond the capabilities of the typical Citadel agents. Much as the Blackened Book does, the Citadel keeps a close eye on unusual and talented individuals, and a party of adventurers might be called upon to assist the Citadel in a dangerous mission.": "当然，这些更大的威胁中有许多可能超出了典型的城堡特工的能力。就像黑化书所做的那样，城主府密切关注不寻常的、有才华的人，一队冒险者可能会被要求协助城主府完成一项危险的任务。",
	"Unlike the Sharn Watch, the Citadel doesn't ask for help: it demands it. The knights of the Citadel are the representatives of the King of Breland, and any Brelish citizen who refuses to help them is committing an act of treason. The Citadel isn't required to provide compensation for the services it demands, but an adventurer who wins the respect of the Citadel can certainly benefit from the relationship.": "与沙恩守望不同，城主府并不要求帮助：它要求帮助。学城的骑士们是布雷兰国王的代表，任何拒绝帮助他们的布雷利什公民都是叛国行为。城主府不需要为它所要求的服务提供补偿，但赢得城主府尊重的冒险者肯定能从这种关系中获益。",
	"The Citadel is made up of these four divisions:": "城堡是由这四个部门组成的。",

	"{@b The King's Wands} are wizards and sorcerers, serving the crown in all arcane matters.": "{@b The King's Wands}是魔法师和巫师，在所有奥秘事务中为王室服务。",
	"The headquarters of the Citadel is in the Ambassador Towers district of Middle Central, in Andith Tower. That structure also serves as the city jail.": "城堡的总部在中环的大使塔区，位于安迪斯塔。该建筑也是城市监狱。",
	"The soldiers of the Redcloak Battalion are among the deadliest warriors in Sharn. When a situation calls for extreme military force, both the Sharn Watch and the King's Citadel turn to the Redcloak Battalion. This elite unit fought in the forefront of the Last War, and the bards in Menthis today sing of the exploits of Khandan the Hammer and Meira the Huntress. At the end of the war, the battalion was split up, and one unit was assigned to Sharn. Its headquarters is located in the Daggerwatch district of Upper Dura.": "红斗篷营的士兵是沙恩最致命的战士之一。当情况需要极端的军事力量时，沙恩守望和国王城堡都会求助于红斗篷营。这支精英部队在最后的战争中战斗在最前线，今天Menthis的吟游诗人唱起了锤子Khandan和女猎人Meira的功绩。战争结束后，该营被拆分，一支部队被分配到沙恩。其总部位于上杜拉的小刀观音区。",
	"Many of the members of the Redcloak Battalion resent being relegated to mere law enforcement, and there is a strong rivalry between the Redcloaks and the King's Swords of the Citadel, who generally have less military experience even though they enjoy far greater authority and prestige.": "红斗篷营的许多成员对被降级为单纯的执法者感到不满，而且红斗篷营与城堡的国王之剑之间存在着强烈的竞争，后者的军事经验通常较少，尽管他们享有更大的权力和威望。",
	"As veterans and heroes of the Last War, many of the Redcloaks are unfriendly toward travelers from other nations. As far as the Redcloaks are concerned, the Treaty of Thronehold is merely an intermission, and soon King Boranel will come to his senses and finish the job that Wroann ir'Wynarn began.": "作为最后战争的老兵和英雄，许多红袍人对来自其他国家的旅行者并不友好。就红袍人而言，《王座条约》只是一个中场休息，很快博拉内尔国王就会恢复理智，完成沃伦-伊尔-维纳恩开始的工作。",
	"Officers of the watch can levy fines on the spot when they catch culprits, which is the typical way that minor crimes are dealt with. For a serious offense, the perpetrator is taken to a garrison and held until a trial can be arranged. A criminal who is considered to be a serious flight risk will be taken to the most secure facility in Sharn—the King's Citadel headquarters.": "值班人员在抓到罪犯时可以当场征收罚款，这是处理轻微犯罪的典型方式。对于严重的犯罪行为，犯罪者会被带到驻军中，并被关押到可以安排的审判。被认为有严重逃亡风险的罪犯会被带到沙恩最安全的设施--国王的城堡总部。",
	"Typically, a prisoner's case comes to the attention of a local magistrate within {@dice 1d4} days. The magistrate reviews the facts of the case and asks the victim to confirm or deny their role in the crime while under the influence of a {@spell zone of truth} spell. The magistrate will then propose a punishment to the accused; if the offer is refused, the case goes to trial.": "通常情况下，囚犯的案件会在{@dice 1d4}天内得到当地法官的关注。地方法官审查案件的事实，并要求受害者在{@spell zone of truth}咒语的影响下确认或否认他们在犯罪中的作用。然后，地方法官将向被告提出处罚建议；如果建议被拒绝，案件将被审判。",
	"Punishment for convicted criminals varies, but long-term imprisonment is quite rare. Prisoners who deemed to be too dangerous to be allowed to roam free are more likely to be executed than imprisoned. Typically, a long prison sentence is used only for criminals who can't be allowed to go free, but whose deaths would have negative diplomatic repercussions.": "对被定罪的罪犯的惩罚各不相同，但长期监禁是相当罕见的。被认为太危险而不允许自由活动的囚犯更有可能被处决而不是被监禁。通常情况下，长期监禁只用于不能允许自由的罪犯，但其死亡会产生负面的外交影响。",
	"Fines are the typical form of punishment. The amount of a fine is generally based on the nature of the crime, but a magistrate has the right to increase a fine to ensure that it is an effective punishment. For example, a fine of 10 gp is crippling to a commoner but can be inconsequential to an adventurer or a member of the Aurum, and in such cases it will be increased. Also, the court can confiscate possessions in lieu of receiving payments in gold; you might not care about having to pay a fine of 100 gp, but having your grandfather's magic sword confiscated instead might sting. If a criminal can't afford to pay a fine, the sentence might be changed to hard labor—or, in the case of adventurers, performing special services on behalf of the city or the Crown.": "罚款是典型的惩罚形式。罚款的数额一般是基于犯罪的性质，但地方法官有权增加罚款以确保它是一种有效的惩罚。例如，10金币的罚款对一个平民来说是致命的，但对一个冒险家或Aurum成员来说可能是无足轻重的，在这种情况下，它将被增加。另外，法庭可以没收财物来代替金币的支付；你可能不在乎必须支付100金币的罚款，但你祖父的魔剑被没收可能会很刺耳。如果一个罪犯无力支付罚金，可能会被改判为苦役，或者在冒险家的情况下，代表城市或王室进行特殊服务。",
	"Other kinds of punishment include branding (generally in a visible location, warning others of your criminal actions), exile, or several magical measures: an ongoing curse, a period of induced blindness, and so on. A repeat offender might be declared an outlaw, which status is often indicated by a brand. An outlaw is stripped of the protection of the law, and anyone can take any action against them without fear of legal retribution.": "其他类型的惩罚包括烙印（一般是在明显的位置，警告他人你的犯罪行为）、流放，或几种魔法措施：持续的诅咒、一段诱导性失明等等。惯犯可能会被宣布为逃犯，这种状态通常以烙印来表示。逃犯被剥夺了法律的保护，任何人都可以对他们采取任何行动而不必担心受到法律的报复。",
	"Get your own Eberron adventures up and running using the inspiration in this chapter. Eberron is filled with political intrigue, extraplanar threats, magical mysteries, and back-alley detective work—all in the context of a world emerging from the turmoil of war.": "利用本章的灵感，让你自己的Eberron冒险开始运行。Eberron充满了政治阴谋、星外威胁、魔法之谜和小巷侦探工作--所有这些都是在一个从战争的动荡中出现的世界背景下发生的。",
	"The tables and advice in this chapter expand on the material in {@book chapter 3|DMG|3} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. Think of this chapter as an extensive library of ideas—villainous schemes, interesting locations, adventure hooks, encounters, and more—to help you flesh out an adventure you create for your Eberron campaign.": "本章中的表格和建议是对《{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}》中的材料的扩展。把本章看作是一个广泛的想法库--反派计划、有趣的地点、冒险钩子、遭遇等等，以帮助你充实你为Eberron战役创建的冒险。",
	"This chapter begins with a look at three key themes that pervade many Eberron adventures: recurring villains, action, and intrigue. Following that overview is an in-depth look at various organizations and other elements you can use to drive the adventures you create. Such elements include maps of locations that can serve as thrilling set pieces; information on the planes of existence, elemental-powered airships, and the lightning rail; and an introductory adventure set in Sharn.": "本章首先介绍了弥漫在许多Eberron冒险中的三个关键主题：反复出现的恶棍、行动和阴谋。在这一概述之后，是对各种组织和其他元素的深入研究，你可以用它们来推动你所创造的冒险。这些元素包括可以作为惊心动魄的场景的地图；关于存在平面、元素驱动的飞艇和闪电轨道的信息；以及一个以沙恩为背景的介绍性冒险。",
	"A group of adventurers leaves the dark, rainy city, putting its mean streets behind them. They board a flame-ringed airship for a journey across the continent, but they're attacked by wyvern-riding bandits on the way and must fight for their lives as the airship hurtles toward the ground!": "一群冒险家离开了黑暗的雨城，将卑鄙的街道抛在脑后。他们登上火环飞艇，准备穿越大陆，但他们在途中遭到了骑狼人的强盗袭击，必须在飞艇冲向地面的过程中为自己的生命而战!",
	"After surviving the crash through a combination of quick thinking and heroic effort, they find themselves stranded in the gray mists of the Mournland, facing the dangers of a war-ravaged land as they try to find their way back to their original destination. The greatest horrors they are about to face might be the ones that lurk in the depths of their own hearts.": "在通过敏捷的思维和英勇的努力从坠机中幸存下来后，他们发现自己被困在哀伤之地的灰色迷雾中，在试图找到回到最初目的地的路上，他们面临着战争蹂躏下的危险。他们即将面临的最大恐怖可能是潜伏在他们自己内心深处的恐怖。",
	"As discussed in the introduction to this book, pulp adventure and noir intrigue are two major themes that interlace in Eberron. Weaving these themes together, or exploring either one in isolation, can give Eberron stories a unique feel. Adventures that take advantage of those themes help to reinforce a sense of place, immersing the players (and you) in a world that is still reeling from the effects of a hundred years of war, that is shaped by modern ideas and aesthetics, and that is set apart from the rest of the D&D multiverse by a magical barrier.": "正如本书介绍中所讨论的，纸浆冒险和黑色阴谋是Eberron中交织的两个主要主题。将这些主题交织在一起，或者孤立地探索其中任何一个，都能给Eberron故事带来独特的感觉。利用这些主题的冒险有助于加强地方感，使玩家（和你）沉浸在一个仍然从百年战争的影响中恢复过来的世界中，这个世界是由现代思想和美学塑造的，并且被一个神奇的屏障与D&D多元宇宙的其他部分分开。",
	"This section is an introduction to those themes, designed to help you tell stories that fit well in Eberron. It explores techniques for making compelling recurring villains, and for keeping the action moving over the course of an adventure. It discusses how to use the Last War as a theme and a setting for adventures, and details the Mournland as an adventure location. It goes on to describe adventures and encounters that can occur in transit—on airships, on lightning rails, and at resting spots along the way. Finally, this section discusses the role that creatures typically defined as \"monsters\" play in Khorvaire, and explores Eberron's cosmology.": "本节是对这些主题的介绍，旨在帮助你讲述适合Eberron的故事。它探讨了制作令人信服的反复出现的反派的技巧，以及在冒险过程中保持行动的技巧。它讨论了如何将 \"最后的战争 \"作为一个主题和冒险的背景，并详细介绍了作为冒险地点的 \"哀伤之地\"。它接着描述了在运输过程中可能发生的冒险和遭遇--在飞艇上、在闪电轨道上以及在沿途的休息点。最后，本节讨论了通常被定义为 \"怪物 \"的生物在Khorvaire中扮演的角色，并探讨了Eberron的宇宙学。",
	"The most effective villains are the ones that return, over and over, to plague their heroic nemeses. When the heroes foil the schemes of an evil mastermind, the clever villain escapes to fight another day. A well-developed recurring villain can put a face to the sinister conspiracies that lurk in the darkness and thus strengthen the players' sense of immersion in the world.": "最有效的反派是那些一次又一次回来困扰他们的英雄对手的反派。当英雄们挫败了一个邪恶主谋的阴谋时，聪明的反派就会逃之夭夭。一个发展良好的反复出现的反派可以为潜伏在黑暗中的险恶阴谋揭开面纱，从而加强玩家对这个世界的沉浸感。",
	"You can make a recurring villain in your campaign more intriguing by introducing moral ambiguity into the villain's background, possibly through references to the individual's experiences during the Last War.": "你可以通过在反派的背景中引入道德上的模糊性来使你的活动中反复出现的反派更加引人注意，可能是通过参考个人在最后战争中的经历。",
	"It was too good to be true.": "这好得不像是真的。",
	"A year ago, the nefarious Alais ir'Rannan was presumed dead when she fell from an airship into the middle of Lake Galifar. Her scheme to bring the towers of Arcanix to the ground likewise seemed ended.": "一年前，邪恶的Alais ir'Rannan从飞艇上坠入加利法尔湖中，被认为已经死亡。她将阿卡尼克斯的塔楼夷为平地的计划似乎也随之结束。",
	"But yesterday, according to eyewitness reports, ir'Rannan was seen in the common room of Passage's own King's Star Inn, talking with two other unsavory-looking characters who could not be identified.": "但昨天，根据目击者的报告，有人看到伊尔兰南在帕萨奇自己的国王之星旅馆的公共房间里，与另外两个看起来不光彩的人物交谈，这些人的身份无法确定。",
	"The first task in crafting a good recurring villain is ensuring that the villain survives a first encounter with the adventurers in order to come back and plague them again. What follows are some tactics to make sure that even the most resourceful characters can't dispose of your villain at the first possible opportunity.": "塑造一个好的反复出现的反派的首要任务是确保反派在与冒险者的第一次遭遇中幸存下来，以便再次回来困扰他们。下面是一些策略，以确保即使是最机智的角色也不能在第一时间处理掉你的反派。",
	"{@b Have Lackeys Do the Work.} A villain can easily postpone that first face-to-face confrontation with the adventurers by having lackeys soften the party up, all the while making sure that the adventurers know whom they work for—thus enhancing the villain's reputation.": "{@b Have Lackeys Do the Work.}一个恶棍可以通过让走狗软化队伍来轻松推迟与冒险者的第一次面对面的对抗，同时确保冒险者知道他们为谁工作--从而提高恶棍的声誉。",
	"{@b Use All Available Resources.} A smart villain, especially one with access to magic, can put a lot of obstacles in the way of an adventuring party. Mechanical and magical traps, wards against divination, and protective magic items are just a few of the security measures available to a resourceful villain. Keep in mind that reports from surviving lackeys—and news about the adventurers from other sources—can give the villain enough information about the party's capabilities to prepare appropriate countermeasures.": "{@b Use All Available Resources.}一个聪明的反派，尤其是一个可以使用魔法的反派，可以在冒险队伍的路上设置很多障碍。机械和魔法陷阱、防止占卜的屏障和保护性的魔法物品只是足智多谋的小人可用的安全措施中的一部分。请记住，从幸存的走狗那里得到的报告，以及从其他来源得到的关于冒险者的消息，可以给小人提供足够的关于队伍能力的信息，以准备适当的反措施。",
	"{@b Have an Escape Plan.} Secret passages, spells of invisibility or teleportation, flying mounts, and throngs of minions can help a villain escape when a confrontation with the adventurers goes badly. Any villain likely has at least one fallback plan.": "{@b Have an Escape Plan.}秘密通道、隐身术或传送术、飞行坐骑和大量的奴仆可以帮助反派在与冒险者的对峙中逃脱。任何恶棍都可能有至少一个后备计划。",
	"{@b Take Hostages}. Most adventurers wouldn't be willing to attack the villain if they fear that the villains' lackeys are about to slaughter innocent captives the moment they draw their swords.": "{@b Take Hostages}. 如果大多数冒险家担心恶棍的走狗在他们拔剑的瞬间就要屠杀无辜的俘虏，他们就不会愿意攻击恶棍。",
	"{@b Returning from Death}. Of course, death is not a final fate for player characters, and it doesn't need to be for villains either. After the adventurers kill their nemesis, they might next encounter the villain raised from the dead or as an undead. It's conceivable that dying could make a villain more powerful and more angry at the meddling adventurers. Alternatively, the characters might assume a villain is dead—after falling over a waterfall, being trapped in a burning building, or getting swallowed by a purple worm—only to discover later that the villain survived and is hungry for revenge.": "{@b Returning from Death}. 当然，死亡并不是玩家角色的最终命运，对反派来说也不需要如此。在冒险家们杀死他们的克星后，他们可能会遇到这个坏蛋从死里复活或变成不死之身。可以想象，死亡可以使反派更加强大，对爱管闲事的冒险者更加愤怒。另外，角色们可能会认为反派已经死了--在跌落瀑布、被困在燃烧的建筑物中或被紫色的虫子吞下之后--后来发现反派幸存下来，并且渴望复仇。",
	"Adventurers get more powerful over time, so if a villain is going to remain a relevant threat, the villain needs to get more powerful as well. There are three ways you can approach this issue:": "随着时间的推移，冒险者会变得更加强大，所以如果一个反派要保持相关的威胁，反派也需要变得更加强大。有三种方法可以处理这个问题。",
	"{@b Mechanical Improvement}. Use the guidelines in {@book chapter 9|DMG|9|Modifying a Monster} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to add class levels or Hit Dice to the villain and improve its challenge rating to make it relevant to the higher-level characters.": "{@b Mechanical Improvement}. 使用{@book chapter 9|DMG|9|Modifying a Monster}中的准则，为小人增加等级或命中率，并提高其挑战等级，使之与高等级角色相关。",
	"{@b NPC Stat Blocks}. Some of the stat blocks in the {@book Monster Manual|MM} can reflect the same character at different stages of advancement. For example, the adventurers might confront a villain who uses the stat block of a {@creature mage} (9th-level wizard) and then returns later as an {@creature archmage} (18th-level wizard). You could also use stat blocks in other sources to add to the sequence, so the characters could even meet this aspiring villain as an {@creature apprentice wizard|VGM} and later as an {@creature evoker|VGM} (both in {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}).": "{@b NPC Stat Blocks}. {@book Monster Manual|MM}中的一些状态块可以反映同一个角色在不同阶段的进步。例如，冒险家们可能会面对一个使用{@creature mage}（9级巫师）状态块的恶棍，然后在后来作为{@creature archmage}（18级巫师）回来。你也可以使用其他来源的状态块来增加这个序列，所以人物甚至可以在{@creature apprentice wizard|VGM}时遇到这个有抱负的恶棍，后来又以{@creature evoker|VGM}的身份出现（都在{@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}）。",
	"{@b Organizations as Villains}. Rather than use an individual as a recurring villain, you could think in terms of the organization the villain belongs to or represents. For example, low-level adventurers might fight low-level agents of the Order of the Emerald Claw and grow to loathe the sight of their claw-shaped symbol and green cloaks. As they attain higher levels, the characters will face increasingly more powerful members of the order.": "{@b Organizations as Villains}. 与其用一个人作为反复出现的反派，你可以从反派所属或代表的组织方面考虑。例如，低级别的冒险者可能会与翡翠之爪组织的低级别的代理人作战，并逐渐厌恶看到他们的爪形标志和绿色斗篷。当他们达到更高的级别时，人物将面对越来越强大的秩序成员。",
	"Moral ambiguity is a feature of the noir genre that can add richness and complexity to an Eberron adventure. In a world where a red dragon isn't necessarily evil (and a bronze one isn't necessarily good), it's impossible to know who you can trust, and even the actions of a so-called villain might not fit neatly into clear-cut definitions of good and evil. Even adventure villains are more often driven by human motives than by cosmic concepts of good and evil. People sometimes do evil things for good reasons.": "道德模糊性是黑色流派的一个特点，可以为Eberron的冒险增加丰富性和复杂性。在这个世界上，红龙不一定是邪恶的（而青铜龙也不一定是好的），你不可能知道谁可以信任，甚至一个所谓的反派的行为也可能不符合明确的善与恶的定义。即使是冒险中的反派，也往往是由人类的动机所驱动，而不是由宇宙的善恶概念所驱动。人们有时会出于好的理由做坏事。",
	"Exercise some caution when exploring these noir themes in the stories you develop. It can be fun for some people to wrestle with moral quandaries in adventures, but it doesn't work for all play groups. In particular, if there's no good solution to the quandary—if the characters have no choice but to follow a course of action they abhor—some players might end up unhappy.": "在你开发的故事中探索这些黑色主题时，要谨慎行事。对一些人来说，在冒险中与道德难题搏斗是很有趣的，但这并不适合所有的游戏团体。特别是，如果没有好的解决办法--如果角色别无选择，只能采取他们厌恶的行动--一些玩家最终可能会不高兴。",
	"The Morally Ambiguous Villains table offers some twists you can add to the villains in this chapter, giving them more or less good reasons to perform their evil deeds.": "道德上模棱两可的恶棍表提供了一些你可以添加到本章中的恶棍身上的转折，让他们有或多或少的理由去做他们的坏事。",
	"The villain is targeting people with aberrant dragonmarks in the desperate hope of preventing another War of the Mark.": "这个恶棍把目标对准了有异常龙纹的人，绝望地希望能阻止另一场龙纹战争。",

	"The villain is rising to power through entirely legal means, winning popular support (through generous campaign promises) and working within the system.": "小人通过完全合法的手段上台，赢得民众支持（通过慷慨的竞选承诺），并在体制内工作。",
	"The villain's schemes are directed at preventing the release of a demonic overlord.": "恶棍的计划是为了阻止一个恶魔霸主的释放。",
	"Not every villain is a mastermind who schemes in the shadows or a world-destroying horror. Sometimes the most significant villain is someone the characters see every day—someone who moves around society in plain sight but keeps their evil deeds well hidden. The law enforcers and adventurers who are trying to bring the villain to justice are thwarted at every turn, unable to find proof of the villain's crimes. If the players come to loathe the villain, everything is going according to plan.": "并非每个反派都是在阴影中策划的主谋，或者是毁灭世界的恐怖人物。有时，最重要的反派是角色们每天都能看到的人--一个在社会上明目张胆地活动，却把他们的恶行隐藏得很好的人。执法者和冒险者试图将这个恶棍绳之以法，却处处受挫，无法找到恶棍犯罪的证据。如果玩家开始厌恶这个恶棍，那么一切都在按计划进行。",

	"A powerful figure in a dragonmarked house is using the house's resources for criminal deeds, but there's no trail of evidence leading back to the villain.": "一座有龙纹的房子里的一个有权势的人物正在利用房子的资源从事犯罪活动，但没有任何证据线索可以追溯到这个恶棍。",
	"A crime lord has the local authorities on the payroll, so no official action will ever be taken to stop their criminal activities.": "犯罪头目将地方当局收入囊中，因此永远不会采取官方行动来阻止他们的犯罪活动。",
	"A villainous mastermind cooperates with local law enforcement to track down and eliminate rival villains, without ever giving the authorities a peek into their own evil deeds.": "一个反派主谋与当地执法部门合作，追踪并消灭对手的反派，却从未让当局窥见自己的恶行。",
	"In contrast to a villain who is a part of the characters' everyday life, an otherworldly villain isn't only anonymous but also fundamentally mysterious. It's not just a question of {@i who} the villain is, but also of {@i what} the villain is, and what extraordinary measures might be required to put a stop to their villainy. Even after the adventurers discover that their long-term nemesis is one of the Inspired, for example, they still need to learn the secrets of the Inspired and their quori masters in order to figure out how to deal with this threat.": "与作为人物日常生活一部分的反派相比，另一个世界的反派不仅是匿名的，而且从根本上说是神秘的。这不仅仅是一个{@i who}小人是什么的问题，也是一个{@i what}小人是什么的问题，以及可能需要采取什么非常规措施来制止他们的小人行为。例如，即使在冒险家们发现他们的长期克星是启发者之一之后，他们仍然需要了解启发者和他们的魁首的秘密，以便弄清楚如何应对这一威胁。",
	"Sometimes the mystery is enough to make such a villain compelling, with curiosity driving the adventurers to delve ever deeper into their foe's secrets. When the time is right, you can turn a mysterious villain into an unnervingly familiar villain—as a quori spirit takes delight in speaking through the mouths of multiple different Inspired hosts, taunting the adventurers for their inability to reach the spirit itself. Then resentment combines with curiosity to drive the adventurers to further exploration. When characters dig deeply into the mysteries of the world, your campaign benefits as they become more immersed in and attached to the setting.": "有时，神秘感足以让这样的反派引人注目，好奇心驱使冒险者不断深入研究他们敌人的秘密。当时机成熟时，你可以把一个神秘的小人变成一个令人不安的熟悉的小人--如一个夸父的灵魂很高兴通过多个不同的灵感主人的嘴说话，嘲弄冒险者，因为他们无法接触到灵魂本身。然后，怨恨与好奇心相结合，驱使冒险家们进一步探索。当角色深入挖掘世界的奥秘时，你的活动就会受益，因为他们会更加沉浸在这个环境中并对其产生感情。",
	"Some mysterious villains wield enough power to threaten the entire world through colossal strength, mastery of magic, dizzying intellect, or overwhelming charisma (or often some combination of these factors). These villains typically lurk in the shadows, pulling the strings of minions and partners while rarely making an appearance themselves. These villains are especially hard to get rid of, even if they are banished or imprisoned—their magic and their network of servants ensure that their reach extends far beyond their physical presence.": "一些神秘的反派通过巨大的力量、对魔法的掌握、令人眼花缭乱的智力或压倒性的魅力（或往往是这些因素的某种组合），拥有足以威胁整个世界的权力。这些反派通常潜伏在暗处，拉拢爪牙和伙伴，而自己却很少露面。这些恶棍特别难以摆脱，即使他们被放逐或监禁--他们的魔法和他们的仆人网络确保他们的影响力远远超过他们的实际存在。",
	"Most villains in this category are numbered among the driving forces described later in this chapter. You can use the Villain You Don't Understand table to choose one of these forces, then consult the adventure seeds and villain ideas in the appropriate section.": "这一类的大多数反派在本章后面描述的推动力量中都有编号。你可以使用 \"你不了解的反派 \"表来选择这些力量中的一种，然后参考相应章节中的冒险种子和反派想法。",
	"Adventures in the pulp tradition tend to start with a bang and proceed at a breakneck pace, reaching a climax in pulse-pounding encounters aboard high-speed vehicles and grand melees in dramatic locations.

Merchants, priests, military officers, and other luminaries gather for grand galas and salons. Beneath this gilded veneer, the members of the Aurum use their shared wealth and power to pursue their selfish goals, and a secret cabal at the heart of this fraternity dreams of global domination.": "从表面上看，Aurum似乎是一个专为Khorvaire最富有和最有影响力的人设立的社团。商人、牧师、军官和其他知名人士聚集在一起举行盛大的晚会和沙龙。在这层镀金的外衣下，Aurum的成员利用他们共享的财富和权力来追求他们自私的目标，而这个兄弟会的核心是一个秘密的阴谋集团，梦想着统治全球。",
	"The Aurum is divided into four suborders called Concords—copper, silver, gold, and platinum, in order of ascendance. Higher rank provides a member with improved access to the resources of the Aurum and a greater voice in society meetings. The Aurum isn't a secret society, and its meeting halls can be found in most major cities. Many powerful people openly wear the eight rings—one on each finger, with the metal indicating the rank of the wearer—that label them as Aurum members. The Aurum frequently engages in acts of philanthropy, and thus some members might be celebrated by their local communities.": "Aurum分为四个子等级，称为Concords--铜、银、金和铂，依次递升。级别越高，会员就越能获得Aurum的资源，并在社会会议中拥有更大的发言权。Aurum并不是一个秘密社团，它的会议厅在大多数大城市都能找到。许多有权势的人公开戴着八个戒指，每个手指上都有一个，金属表明佩戴者的等级，表明他们是Aurum成员。曙光会经常从事慈善活动，因此一些成员可能会受到当地社区的赞誉。",
	"When members gather, they discuss shared interests, especially in history and archaeology. Aurum members often take an interest in a particular civilization or era of history; one Concordian collects relics of the Cul'sir giants of Xen'drik, while another pursues artifacts of the dragons of Argonnessen. One of the most common ways in which adventurers cross paths with the Aurum is through these collectors. Members of the Aurum often fund expeditions to exotic lands or newly discovered ruins, interested in expanding their private hoards. Occasionally a Concordian tries to acquire prized relics through less honorable means; adventurers could be employed to acquire an exotic prize from a rival through any means necessary, legal or otherwise.": "当成员聚会时，他们讨论共同的兴趣，特别是在历史和考古学方面。Aurum成员通常对某个特定的文明或历史时代感兴趣；一个Concordian人收集Xen'drik的Cul's sir巨人的遗物，而另一个则追求Argonnessen龙的文物。冒险家们与曙光会交手的最常见方式之一就是通过这些收藏家。奥鲁姆的成员经常资助探险队前往异国他乡或新发现的遗迹，对扩大他们的私人囤积物感兴趣。偶尔也有康科迪亚人试图通过不那么光荣的手段获得珍贵的遗物；冒险者可以被雇佣，通过任何必要的手段，不管是合法的还是其他的，从对手那里获得异域的奖品。",
	"All of these activities are entirely legitimate. The Aurum is a society for wealthy scholars and philanthropists. But there is a secret order that ranks higher than the Platinum Concord—an inner circle known as the Shadow Cabinet. The members of this cabal are nobles but not kings; they are powerful industrialists, but not dragonmarked barons. They are determined to become the true rulers of Khorvaire, whether by binding the current barons and monarchs to their will or by tearing down the current systems and creating something new.": "所有这些活动都是完全合法的。Aurum是一个为富有的学者和慈善家服务的社团。但有一个比白金协约更高级的秘密秩序--一个被称为影子内阁的内部圈子。这个阴谋集团的成员是贵族，但不是国王；他们是强大的工业家，但不是龙纹男爵。他们决心成为Khorvaire的真正统治者，无论是通过将当前的男爵和君主束缚在他们的意志之下，还是通过拆毁当前的系统并创造新的东西。",
	"In stories driven by action, the Aurum can fund expeditions to exotic lands and use magical doomsday devices to hold cities for ransom. In adventures driven by intrigue, the Aurum provides an opportunity to explore the lure of gold, and how far the characters might go in the service of an amoral patron.": "在以行动为导向的故事中，Aurum可以为远征异国他乡提供资金，并使用神奇的末日装置来勒索城市的赎金。在由阴谋驱动的冒险中，Aurum提供了一个机会来探索黄金的诱惑，以及人物在为不道德的主顾服务时可能走多远。",
	"The Last War gave birth to the Shadow Cabinet. The war ignited the passions of Concordians who blamed the monarchs of the Five Nations for the vast devastation and loss. It also created opportunities that never existed under the united Galifar. Many of the members of the Aurum gained influence by bankrolling one or more war efforts, or by stepping in to maintain the infrastructure while the government directed its attention to military matters. The Aurum also includes a number of powerful military officers and warlords. Some despise the nobles that drove them to war; others are furious that the war ended without a decisive victory. Either way, these can provide the Shadow Cabinet with unexpected military power.": "最后一场战争催生了影子内阁。这场战争点燃了康科迪亚人的激情，他们指责五国君主造成了巨大的破坏和损失。它也创造了在统一的加利法尔时期从未存在过的机会。Aurum的许多成员通过为一场或多场战争提供资金，或在政府将注意力集中在军事事务上时介入维护基础设施，从而获得影响力。奥鲁姆还包括一些强大的军事官员和军阀。有些人鄙视驱使他们参战的贵族；有些人则对战争没有取得决定性的胜利就结束感到愤怒。无论怎样，这些都能为影子内阁提供意想不到的军事力量。",
	"Now, amid the war's cooling ashes, the Aurum's power is fragmented. On several occasions, investments and gambles that paid dividends in money and power to one Concordian sapped the fortune of another, because each was unknowingly working against the other's interests. Huge collections of art, historical artifacts, and precious tomes were destroyed or lost during the war, and the Aurum's leaders salivate at the thought of recovering some of those riches.": "现在，在战争冷却的灰烬中，Aurum的力量四分五裂。有几次，为一个康科迪亚人带来金钱和权力红利的投资和赌博耗尽了另一个康科迪亚人的财富，因为每个人都在不知不觉中与对方的利益作对。大量的艺术品、历史文物和珍贵的书籍在战争中被毁或丢失，而Aurum的领导人一想到能找回其中的一些财富就垂涎三尺。",
	"Aurum Concordians are defined by their wealth and power. When you create an Aurum NPC, consider the source of that person's wealth and how it is expressed. The dwarf Antus ir'Soldorak is chancellor of the Platinum Concord and founder of the Shadow Cabinet.

	"Unlike other organizations with global reach, the cults have no organizing structure or principle. They are an infection inflicted on the world without reason. \"Cult of the Dragon Below\" is a term that outsiders use to describe any sect devoted to the daelkyr or the overlords.

You can roll on the Cult of the Dragon Below table to get a quick description of a cult, or you can create something entirely new.

In this time of uncertainty and fear, it's easy for people to gravitate toward a group that provides a sense of purpose or a promise of security. This mindset is intensified by the spread of refugees in the wake of the Mourning, and by the lingering animosity that continues to divide people. In the Mror Holds, the conflict with {@creature Dyrrn|ERLW|Dyrrn the Corruptor} has begun to leave its mark, with new cults appearing throughout the nation.

	"The cults can also serve different styles of play. One would be perfect for a slowly unfolding investigation that starts out seemingly mundane, but slowly delves deeper into otherworldly influences and dark magic. Allies become suspect, and perhaps even erstwhile enemies become necessary bedfellows.": "这些邪教也可以为不同的游戏风格服务。其中一个非常适合慢慢展开的调查，开始时似乎很平凡，但慢慢深入到其他世界的影响和黑魔法。盟友变得可疑，甚至昔日的敌人也可能成为必要的伙伴。",

	"The reach of the houses is so extensive that they have interests in every facet of life in the civilized lands of Khorvaire and beyond. Those interests often bring them into conflict with local rulers and national governments. Unified Galifar had the strength and influence to impose its will on the collected dragonmarked houses, but in the wake of the war it remains to be seen if any single nation has the resources to challenge them.": "这些家族的影响力是如此之大，以至于他们在Khorvaire和其他地方的文明土地上的生活的每一个方面都有利益。这些利益常常使他们与地方统治者和国家政府发生冲突。统一的加利法尔有实力和影响力将其意志强加给收集到的龙纹家族，但在战争结束后，是否有任何一个国家有资源来挑战它们，还有待观察。",
	"Although most houses have distinct spheres of interest, their concerns overlap just enough to cause friction. House Orien's control of transportation and shipping is threatened by the growing reach of House Lyrandar's airships.

	"The dragonmarked houses generally thrived during the Last War. Each house's unique talents were easily adapted to the war effort.

	"In some ways, though, the dragonmarked houses did feel the brunt of the conflict. House Cannith, for instance, suffered great setbacks near the end of the war. Many of its foundries and factories were destroyed, and the Treaty of Thronehold forced the house to dismantle the creation forges that produced the warforged. Worst of all for the house, the destruction of Cyre left Cannith without a clear leader, resulting in the house being fragmented into three semi-independent branches.": "不过，在某些方面，有龙纹的家族确实在冲突中首当其冲。例如，坎尼斯家族在战争即将结束时遭受了巨大的挫折。它的许多铸造厂和工厂都被摧毁了，《王座条约》迫使该家族拆除了生产战时锻造品的创造锻造厂。最糟糕的是，赛尔的毁灭使得坎尼斯没有一个明确的领导者，导致该家族被分割成三个半独立的分支。",

	"Arcane workshops have many features in common, from workbenches and tools to diagrams etched into the floors and walls. Although most workshops are controlled by House Cannith, that house is not the only group of artificers who build and operate such locations.

The wizards of Arcanix in Aundair who create magic items and test new spells build specialized workshops for those purposes.": "奥术工坊有许多共同的特点，从工作台和工具到刻在地板和墙壁上的图示。虽然大多数工场都由坎尼斯家族控制，但该家族并不是唯一一个建造和经营此类场所的工匠团体。捆绑元素的Zil地精和锻造强大武器和盔甲的Moror矮人必须有专门的空间来进行这项工作。昂代尔（Aundair）的阿卡尼克斯（Arcanix）的巫师们创造魔法物品并测试新的法术，为这些目的建立专门的工场。",

At the same time, the houses also represent a way to explore the consequences of corporate greed and unrestrained expansion.

Dragons in the world are either aloof and unapproachable, or they are curious and manipulative, pulling strings behind the scenes or trying to influence the world in arcane ways.": "Eberron的龙不仅仅是单纯的怪物；冒险家们很少会闯入龙的巢穴去寻找它的宝藏群。在这个世界上，龙要么是冷漠的、不可接近的，要么是好奇的、善于操纵的，在幕后牵线搭桥，或者试图以神秘的方式影响世界。",
	"Most dragons live on the mystery-shrouded continent of Argonnessen and avoid contact with those they see as lesser creatures. They are obsessed with the Draconic Prophecy, which is a map of possible futures rather than a clear-cut prediction. Its paths are revealed in the motion of planes and moons, in the actions of the dragonmarked houses, and in dozens of other more subtle manifestations. Most dragons that are active in Khorvaire are part of a cabal known as the Chamber.": "大多数龙生活在神秘的阿贡纳森大陆上，避免与他们认为较低级的生物接触。他们痴迷于龙族的预言，这是一张可能的未来的地图，而不是一个明确的预测。它的路径在飞机和月亮的运动中，在龙纹屋的行动中，以及在其他几十种更微妙的表现中被揭示。大多数活跃在霍尔韦尔的龙都是一个被称为商会的阴谋集团的一部分。",
	"A dragon in Khorvaire that isn't part of the Chamber could be an exile driven from Argonnessen for some crime or a scholar pursuing independent research. Some orphaned dragons grow up in Khorvaire without contact with Argonnessen, and some dragons have been twisted by the daelkyr or corrupted by fiends; any of these could be an antagonist if the adventure you're crafting calls for a cruel dragon.": "在Khorvaire，不属于商会的龙可能是因某种罪行而被赶出Argonnessen的流放者，或者是追求独立研究的学者。有些孤儿龙在霍尔韦尔长大，与阿贡纳森没有联系，有些龙被达尔凯尔扭曲，或者被恶魔腐蚀；如果你要设计的冒险需要一条残酷的龙，那么这些龙都可以成为一个对立面。",
	"The dragons of Eberron aren't restricted in alignment—good red dragons and evil gold dragons are equally common. Most dragons tend toward neutrality. Even those with good alignments often don't consider the impact of their actions on lesser beings; if a Chamber dragon must destroy a human village to foil the plans of a demon, it will do so without hesitation.": "Eberron的龙在结盟方面不受限制--善良的红龙和邪恶的金龙同样常见。大多数龙都倾向于中立。即使是那些有良好倾向的龙，也常常不考虑它们的行为对低等生物的影响；如果一条商会龙必须摧毁一个人类村庄以挫败一个恶魔的计划，它将毫不犹豫地这样做。",
	"Conspiracy theorists insist that a network of dragons is hidden in Khorvaire, and these mighty creatures use powerful magic and humanoid agents to work their will across the continent and beyond. These claims are usually dismissed as madness, but they are in fact correct. The Chamber is a cabal of dragons that have monitored Khorvaire for thousands of years, treating humanoids as pawns in an ancient game.": "阴谋论者坚持认为，在霍尔韦尔隐藏着一个龙的网络，这些强大的生物利用强大的魔法和人形代理人在整个大陆和其他地方实现他们的意志。这些说法通常被斥为疯狂，但事实上它们是正确的。密室是一个由龙组成的阴谋集团，数千年来一直监视着霍尔韦尔，把人形生物当作一个古老游戏中的棋子。",
	"First and foremost, the dragons of the Chamber are observers, gathering information about new aspects of the Prophecy and sharing it with their elders in Argonnessen. They are also charged with stopping any creature that seeks to use the Prophecy for its own ends. This responsibility sets them against the Lords of Dust, who must manipulate the Prophecy in order to release their fiendish overlords. It also leads them to recruit or eliminate any humanoid who learns too much about the Prophecy.": "首先，商会的龙是观察者，收集有关预言的新方面的信息，并与他们在阿贡纳森的长老分享。他们还负责阻止任何试图利用预言来达到自己目的的生物。这项责任使他们与尘土领主对抗，后者必须操纵预言以释放他们邪恶的霸主。这也导致他们招募或消灭任何对预言了解过多的类人。",
	"The Chamber is loosely organized. Each dragon monitors its own small corner of the world and maintains a network of humanoid agents. Although the mission of the Chamber is one of observation, individual dragons often have their own agendas. Some seek to manipulate the Prophecy personally, directing the future along a particular path. Others conduct experiments on dragonmarked humanoids, trying to understand the connection between these creatures and the Prophecy. Still others are obsessed with the Lords of Dust engage in century-spanning games of cat-and-mouse with their fiendish counterparts. In general, the Chamber seeks to maintain the status quo and opposes demons, so agents of the Chamber can often be useful allies or patrons. But ultimately humanoids are just pawns in the dragons' eyes, and they readily sacrifice any of those pawns to ensure the sanctity of the Prophecy and the defeat of the Lords of Dust.": "商会的组织很松散。每条龙都监视着自己世界的一个小角落，并维持着一个人形特工网络。虽然商会的任务是观察，但个别龙往往有自己的议程。有些龙试图亲自操纵预言，将未来引向一个特定的道路。其他人则对带有龙纹的人类进行实验，试图了解这些生物与预言之间的联系。还有一些人痴迷于 \"尘埃领主\"，与他们的恶魔同行进行跨越世纪的猫捉老鼠游戏。一般来说，商会寻求维持现状并反对恶魔，所以商会的代理人往往可以成为有用的盟友或赞助人。但在龙的眼中，人类终究只是棋子，他们很乐意牺牲任何一个棋子来确保预言的神圣性和尘土领主的失败。",
	"The lives of humanoids and the welfare of their nations mean little to the ancient dragons. A member of the Chamber who is friendly now might turn out to be little more than a war criminal, responsible for horrible atrocities while directing critical events of the war to ensure that a skirmish or an untimely assassination didn't derail some crucial stanza of the Prophecy. An even more disturbing prospect is that the Mourning might have been orchestrated by the Chamber, either as part of its struggle against the Lords of Dust or even directly in response to the dictates of the Prophecy.": "人类的生命和他们国家的福利对古龙来说没有什么意义。现在友好的商会成员可能会变成一个战争罪犯，在指挥战争的关键事件时对可怕的暴行负有责任，以确保一场小规模的冲突或一次不合时宜的暗杀不会破坏预言的某些关键章节。一个更令人不安的前景是，哀悼会可能是由商会策划的，作为其与尘土领主斗争的一部分，甚至直接响应预言的指令。",
	"Whatever the truth, the Last War's impact on the Chamber was small in the grand scheme of things. Planar observatories were damaged here and there, humanoid servants died in droves, and the clash of armies derailed short-term plans. But even the effects of a hundred years of war are minor in the context of plans that span continents and millennia.": "无论真相如何，最后的战争对商会的影响在整个计划中是很小的。行星观测站在这里和那里被损坏，人形仆人成群结队地死去，军队的冲突破坏了短期计划。但即使是百年战争的影响，在跨越大陆和千年的计划中也是微不足道的。",
	"A planar observatory is a structure at the heart of the Chamber's efforts to divine the meaning of the draconic Prophecy. The observatory consists of great chambers of crystal and metal, lined with huge orreries that track and align with the planes and the Ring of Siberys.": "平面观察站是商会为解释龙族预言的意义而努力的核心结构。观察站由巨大的水晶和金属室组成，内有巨大的轨道，追踪并对准平面和西伯里斯之环。",
	"Map 4.2 shows what a planar observatory might look like. These immense locations are constructed by and for dragons. The orreries that surround the central space track the courses of the planes as they shift toward and away from Eberron. All about the observatory are enormous dragonshards of all three kinds (Eberron, Khyber, and Siberys).": "地图4.2显示了一个平面观测站可能是什么样子。这些巨大的地方是由龙建造的，也是为龙建造的。围绕着中央空间的兽栏追踪着平面的走向，因为它们在向Eberron转移和离开。观察站周围都是三种类型的巨大龙鳞（Eberron、Khyber和Siberys）。",
	"Each observatory must be built in a location that is balanced between Siberys and Khyber; finding such a site might take years of careful study and surveying, and these places are typically remote. Several are located in Argonnessen; those in Khorvaire are usually found in mountain ranges and hidden forest clearings. Many have crystal roofs, or domes that open with the aid of great mechanisms to allow an unobstructed view of the night sky, since the movements of Eberron's moons are thought to correspond to the shifting relationships among the planes.": "每个观察站都必须建在西伯利亚和开伯尔之间的平衡位置；找到这样的地点可能需要多年的仔细研究和勘察，而且这些地方通常都很偏远。有几个位于Argonnessen；Khorvaire的那些通常在山脉和隐蔽的森林空地上找到。很多都有水晶屋顶，或者借助巨大的机械装置打开的穹顶，以使夜空的景色一览无余，因为艾伯伦的月亮的运动被认为是与各平面之间的变化关系相对应。",
	"The characters might find their way to a planar observatory as unwitting minions of a Chamber observer, as a destination in their struggles against servants of the Lords of Dust, or even accidentally. The Planar Observatory Adventures table presents some possibilities.": "角色们可能会在不知情的情况下，作为商会观察者的爪牙，在与尘土领主的仆人斗争的过程中，甚至在意外的情况下，发现自己来到了一个平面观测站。平面观测站历险表提供了一些可能性。",

	"In a campaign featuring the Chamber, the adventurers might initially carry out simple tasks on behalf of a disguised dragon or secret Chamber agent, not necessarily doing anything shady or villainous, but maneuvering pieces into position so they can play their designated parts. As the campaign unfolds, the dragons of the Chamber might reveal that the adventurers have their own part to play—in particular, perhaps, any member of the party who bears a dragonmark. The Chamber begins interfering in the characters' activities, for good and for ill, and the Lords of Dust might also get involved. Unfortunately for the adventurers, the dragons are not necessarily any more concerned for their well-being than the Lords of Dust are, and the characters might have to consort or cooperate with demons in order to escape the clutches of the dragons.": "在以商会为主题的活动中，冒险者最初可能会代表伪装的龙或商会的秘密特工执行简单的任务，不一定要做什么见不得人的事，也不一定要做什么坏事，但要操纵碎片进入位置，以便发挥他们的指定作用。随着战役的展开，商会的龙可能会发现冒险者们也有自己的角色要扮演--特别是，也许是任何带有龙纹的成员。商会开始干预人物的活动，不管是好事还是坏事，尘土领主也可能参与进来。对冒险者来说，不幸的是，龙并不一定比尘土领主更关心他们的福祉，为了逃脱龙的魔掌，人物可能不得不与恶魔结盟或合作。",
	"Throughout the campaign, the goals of the Chamber might not be readily apparent. Locations such as the planar observatory described here might be able to give the adventurers some insight into the substance of the Prophecy they have become tangled up in, and seers and sages might be able to offer further insight into the different ways that the demons and the dragons could be interpreting those words. Ultimately, the adventurers might be in the position of having to choose between an outcome that is bad for them but good for the world in the long term, or a short-term triumph that carries tremendous risk for the world in the distant (or not too distant) future.": "在整个活动中，商会的目标可能并不明显。像这里描述的平面观测站这样的地点，可能会让冒险者对他们所卷入的预言的实质有一些了解，而预言家和圣人可能会对恶魔和龙对这些话的不同解释提供进一步的见解。最终，冒险家们可能不得不在一个对他们不利但对世界长期有利的结果，或一个对世界在遥远（或不太遥远）的未来具有巨大风险的短期胜利之间做出选择。",
	"Another possibility is that the adventurers are openly working with the Chamber to gather information on the Prophecy and fight the Lords of Dust.

	"In the spaces between sleeping and waking, nightmares wait with grasping claws. The quori spirits that rule Dal Quor spent a thousand years seizing control of the continent of Sarlona. Now they have turned their many eyes toward Khorvaire. The ultimate goal of the Dreaming Dark is to control all the nations of the world. The plane of Dal Quor goes through cycles of light and darkness, and the current age is coming to an end. The nightmare spirits that rule the plane believe that by seizing control of mortal civilization—by forcing all the people of Eberron to dream the dreams they devise—they can maintain this current age of darkness indefinitely. So the fiends of the Dreaming Dark aren't merely hungry for power; they are fighting for survival.": "在睡与醒之间的空间里，恶梦用抓取的爪子等待着。统治Dal Quor的Quori精神花了一千年的时间来夺取对Sarlona大陆的控制。现在，他们已经将他们众多的目光转向了霍瓦伊尔。梦幻黑暗的最终目标是控制世界上的所有国家。达尔-库尔平面经历着光明与黑暗的循环，而当前的时代即将结束。统治这个位面的恶梦之灵相信，通过夺取对凡人文明的控制，通过强迫艾伯伦的所有人做他们设计的梦，他们可以无限期地维持目前这个黑暗的时代。因此，做梦的黑暗世界的恶魔们不仅仅是对权力的渴望；他们是在为生存而战。",
	"The greatest weapon of the Dreaming Dark is its ability to infiltrate other organizations. Anyone could become an Inspired vessel, or be prompted into taking foolish action by a dream. Its agents are scattered across the world and have no obvious connection to one another, until they reveal their true nature and purpose.": "做梦的黑暗组织最大的武器是其渗透到其他组织的能力。任何人都可能成为受启发的容器，或者被梦境促使采取愚蠢的行动。它的代理人分散在世界各地，彼此之间没有明显的联系，直到他们暴露出自己的真实性质和目的。",
	"The chaos that reigned during the Last War enabled the agents of the Dreaming Dark to move and act with absolute freedom throughout Khorvaire. Any direct conflict among Eberron's humanoid populations is a boon to this group, which wants to destabilize all of them. Many of the intense battles near the end of the war might have been avoided, if not for Dreaming Dark agents fanning the flames of fear and hate—often by invading the dreams of soldiers and rulers alike.": "最后一次战争期间的混乱，使得梦幻黑暗的代理人能够在整个Khorvaire自由地行动和行事。Eberron的类人种群之间的任何直接冲突都是这个组织的福音，他们想要破坏所有的稳定。如果不是造梦的黑暗代理人煽动恐惧和仇恨的火焰--通常是通过入侵士兵和统治者的梦境，许多接近战争末期的激烈战斗可能已经避免了。",
	"The feelings of mistrust and festering animosity between the nations that linger after the Treaty of Thronehold provide the Dreaming Dark with countless points of possible infection. Refugees, expatriates, and other displaced people provide the perfect vehicle for the Dreaming Dark to spread its influence across Khorvaire, carrying its corruption into new populations.": "在《王权条约》签订后，各国之间的不信任感和不断发酵的敌意为逐梦的黑暗提供了无数可能的感染点。难民、侨民和其他流离失所者为造梦的黑暗提供了完美的载体，使其影响遍及霍尔韦尔，将其腐败带入新的人群。",
	"If you plan to use the Dreaming Dark as a major villain in your campaign, it can be helpful to establish the role of dreams early on. If dreams feel like a regular part of the story, it will be less obvious when the Dreaming Dark starts manipulating the characters' dreams. For example, you might establish a pattern of picking one adventurer and discussing their dreams each time the group takes a long rest. Consider these ideas for the basic seed of a dream:": "如果你打算在你的活动中使用做梦的黑暗作为一个主要的反派，那么在早期建立梦的作用会很有帮助。如果感觉梦境是故事的一个常规部分，那么当梦境黑客开始操纵人物的梦境时，就不会那么明显了。例如，你可以建立一种模式，在每次小组休息的时候挑选一个冒险者并讨论他们的梦。请考虑这些关于梦的基本种子的想法。",

Having conquered Sarlona by means of such manipulation, the Dreaming Dark has turned its sights to Khorvaire—which is already a continent in turmoil.": "很久以前，做梦的黑暗在萨洛纳大陆上造成了一段漫长的纷争，在当时掌握权力的各个国家之间和内部助长了猜疑、叛乱、恐惧、偏见和贪婪。在混乱的时候，科里人也精心培养了人类的血统，这些血统将成为启发者，完全适合作为科里人精神的宿主。然后，当旧王国的毁灭完成后，一群大胆的冠军--受启发的黑暗之船--从旧王国的灰烬中形成了一个新的国家。在通过这种操纵手段征服了萨洛纳之后，梦幻黑暗将其目光转向了霍尔韦尔--这已经是一个动荡的大陆。",
	"With the conquest of the entire continent in mind, the Dreaming Dark has three objectives in Khorvaire. The first is to cause chaos and strife whenever possible, turning allies against one another and spreading fear. The second is to promote their chosen champions. A champion could be a nation, a mercenary company, a dragonmarked house, or a religion—whatever it is, it will have been thoroughly subverted by the Dreaming Dark. Finally, the Dreaming Dark relentlessly pursues the kalashtar and takes every opportunity to bring down these enemies. The kalashtar are descended from rebel quori that defied the Dreaming Dark and want to push Dal Quor into an age of light.": "怀着对整个大陆的征服之心，梦幻黑暗在霍尔韦尔有三个目标。第一是尽可能地造成混乱和纷争，使盟友之间相互对立，并散布恐惧。第二是促进他们选定的冠军。冠军可以是一个国家、一个雇佣兵公司、一个有龙纹的家族，或者一个宗教--无论它是什么，它都会被逐梦的黑暗彻底颠覆。最后，造梦的黑暗无情地追捕卡拉什塔，并利用一切机会来打倒这些敌人。kalashtar是反抗造梦的黑暗的反叛者quori的后裔，他们想把Dal Quor推向一个光明的时代。",
	"Given those objectives, the Dreaming Dark can drive events on a small scale, by setting bandits in motion or triggering local feuds, or the adventurers might uncover evidence of plans that could reignite the Last War or bring an entire nation or religion under the sway of the Dreaming Dark.": "考虑到这些目标，\"梦幻黑暗 \"可以在小范围内推动事件的发生，通过让强盗们行动起来或引发当地的争斗，或者冒险者们可能会发现一些计划的证据，这些计划可能会重新点燃最后的战争或将整个国家或宗教置于梦幻黑暗的控制之下。",
	"The Dreaming Dark Adventure Hooks table offers some ideas for strange occurrences and nightmarish events that can touch off stories involving the Dreaming Dark.": "梦中的黑暗冒险钩子表提供了一些关于奇怪事件和噩梦般的事件的想法，可以触动涉及梦中黑暗的故事。",
	"The high priest of a temple falls into a deep sleep from which nothing can awaken them.": "一个寺庙的大祭司陷入了深沉的睡眠，没有什么可以唤醒他们。",
	"The characters notice a pattern after defeating several foes: each enemy exhibited a particular quirk of speech or gesture. They now recognize that quirk in an ally or mentor.": "角色们在击败几个敌人后注意到一个模式：每个敌人都表现出一种特殊的语言或姿态怪癖。他们现在能认出盟友或导师身上的这种怪癖。",
	"A mad wizard encoded the remedy to a destructive spell in their own dreams. The characters must enter the dreamscape and recover the remedy.": "一个疯狂的巫师在自己的梦中编码了一个破坏性咒语的补救措施。角色们必须进入梦境，恢复补救措施。",

	"Once, Droaam was a wild frontier that marked the edge of civilized Khorvaire. Today, it is home to one of the strangest nations on the continent. In the streets of the Great Crag, ogres and minotaurs rub shoulders with gnolls and goblins. Gargoyles and wyverns circle in the sky, while harpies call work crews to the quarries with their songs. Under the rule of the enigmatic Daughters of Sora Kell, this land grows stronger with each passing year.": "曾经，Droaam是一个野蛮的边境，标志着文明的Khorvaire的边缘。今天，它是大陆上最奇怪的国家之一的家园。在大峭壁的街道上，食人魔和牛头人与地精和妖精擦肩而过。石像鬼和翼龙在天空中盘旋，而女妖则用她们的歌声召唤采石场的工作人员。在神秘的索拉-凯尔之女的统治下，这片土地一年比一年强大。",
	"In a shocking move, King Boranel has ordered that all Brelish citizens who live west of the Graywall Mountains must leave their homes and return to the eastern lands, or else forfeit their claim to the king's protection. In the face of a few withered hags and a ragtag \"army\" of filthy ogres and mangy gnolls, King Boranel's legendary courage has apparently faltered. We can only assume he means to yield to Cyre next.": "在一个令人震惊的举动中，Boranel国王已经下令，所有居住在灰墙山脉以西的Brelish公民必须离开他们的家园，回到东部的土地，否则就会失去对国王保护的要求。面对几个枯萎的女巫和一支由肮脏的食人魔和癞皮地精组成的破烂 \"军队\"，博拉内尔国王的传奇勇气显然已经动摇了。我们只能假设他的意思是接下来要向赛尔屈服。",
	"Thanks to the guidance of the hags, the diverse inhabitants of Droaam are learning to work together and finding ways to use their supernatural gifts to help build and sustain society. A medusa might use its petrifying gaze to preserve the life of an injured ally until medical attention can be obtained. Harpies in the taverns of Droaam use their hypnotic songs to entertain rather than to harm. When you bring creatures from Droaam into the campaign, consider how different monsters can work together in unusual ways and how their special abilities could be used outside combat.": "由于女巫的指导，德罗阿姆的不同居民正在学习合作，并找到方法使用他们的超自然天赋来帮助建立和维持社会。美杜莎可能会用它石化的目光来保护一个受伤的盟友的生命，直到获得医疗照顾。Droaam酒馆里的女妖用她们催眠的歌声来娱乐而不是伤害。当你把德拉姆的生物带入战役时，考虑不同的怪物如何以不寻常的方式合作，以及它们的特殊能力如何在战斗之外使用。",
	"Droaam offers a way to introduce monsters into any adventure, and for characters to encounter these monsters in untraditional ways. Droaam demonstrates that even monstrous creatures want the same things that members of other races do, more or less.": "Droaam提供了一种将怪物引入任何冒险的方法，并让角色以非传统的方式遇到这些怪物。德罗亚姆表明，即使是畸形生物也希望与其他种族的成员做同样的事情，或多或少。",
	"Droaamish monsters of a civilized bent could appear anywhere in Khorvaire. House Tharashk brokers the services of Droaamish monsters across the continent. Some of these monsters can appear in traditionally aggressive roles, as mercenary soldiers, a crime lord's bodyguards, or assassins in the shadows of Sharn. But Tharashk also provides less violent services. Ogre laborers put their strength to practical use in many of the continent's cities. Gargoyle couriers are in high demand. Though monstrous workers of these sorts are still rare in many nations, their numbers are growing.": "具有文明倾向的Droaamish怪物可能出现在Khorvaire的任何地方。萨拉什克家族为整个大陆的德罗阿米什怪兽提供中介服务。其中一些怪物可以以传统的攻击性角色出现，如雇佣兵、犯罪大王的保镖，或在沙恩的阴影中的刺客。但塔拉什克也提供不太暴力的服务。食人魔劳动者在大陆的许多城市中把他们的力量用于实际用途。巨妖快递员的需求量很大。尽管这类怪物工人在许多国家仍很罕见，但他们的数量正在增加。",
	"Conversely, a visit to Droaam gives adventurers a chance to explore a land untethered by the laws of the treaty nations, a realm where they are the outsiders and the monsters are at home. Adventurers might have to pursue a fugitive or a war criminal into Droaam, or go there in search of unusual services or information found only in the land of monsters.": "相反，对Droaam的访问给了冒险者一个机会去探索一个不受条约国家法律约束的土地，一个他们是局外人而怪物是自在的境界。冒险家们可能需要追捕逃犯或战犯到德拉姆，或者去那里寻找不寻常的服务或只有在怪物之乡才能找到的信息。",
	"Droaam is home to a vast array of creatures. Many of these races maintain isolated enclaves: the medusa city of Cazhaak Draal, the harpy flights of the Byeshk Mountains, the scattered minotaur clans, the mysterious changeling city known as Lost. But other creatures have long been commingled. The ogres, orcs, trolls, hill giants, goblins, and kobolds of Droaam have never had distinct cultures; they have always been blended. Although enclaves made up of a single kind of creature do exist, most communities contain a mix of creatures.": "德罗亚姆是众多生物的家园。其中许多种族保持着孤立的飞地：卡扎克-德拉尔（Cazhaak Draal）的美杜莎城、拜什克山脉的鹞子飞翔、分散的牛头人氏族、被称为 \"迷失 \"的神秘变异人城市。但其他生物也早已混杂其中。卓雅姆的食人魔、兽人、巨魔、山丘巨人、地精和哥布林从来没有独特的文化；他们一直都是混合的。虽然确实存在由单一种类的生物组成的飞地，但大多数社区都包含生物的混合体。",
	"In bygone days, many of these groups of creatures lived in transient communities, ruled by the most powerful among them and constantly in conflict with neighboring forces. When the Daughters of Sora Kell rose to power, they used force and persuasion to bring an end to this violence. They recognized the most powerful existing warlords as rulers of their domains, and they appointed lieutenants—including oni and other powerful and intelligent creatures—to govern other regions.": "在过去的日子里，这些生物群体中的许多人生活在短暂的社区中，由他们中最强大的人统治，并不断与邻近的势力发生冲突。当索拉-凯尔的女儿们崛起时，她们用武力和劝说来结束这种暴力。她们承认现有的最强大的军阀是其领地的统治者，并任命副手--包括鬼怪和其他强大而聪明的生物--管理其他地区。",
	"Within Droaam, any creature that commands the loyalty of a band and has successfully claimed and held territory can call itself a warlord, but only a small number of such leaders wield significant power. A few of the most notable warlords and factions are described below.": "在Droaam内部，任何能指挥一个团体的忠诚，并成功地要求和保持领土的生物都可以称自己为军阀，但只有少数这样的领导人拥有重要的权力。下面介绍几个最引人注目的军阀和派别。",

Gorodan knows a great deal about Xen'drik and could prove a valuable resource to adventurers.": "{@b Gorodan Ashlord}. 一个被放逐出Xen'drik的火巨人赢得了一支由食人魔和山地巨人组成的强大力量的忠诚。戈罗丹对Xen'drik非常了解，可以证明是冒险者的宝贵资源。",
	"{@b Harpy Flights}. The harpies have long dwelled in the Byeshk Mountains. Several flights across the nation—including the Stormsinger, Last Dirge, and Rotwing—have pledged themselves to the Daughters of Sora Kell. Other flights remain in isolation in the mountains. The largest of these is the Wind Howlers, whose leader, Callain of the Bloody Word, despises the hags.": "{@b Harpy Flights}. 长期以来，哈比人一直居住在拜什克山中。全国各地的几个航班--包括风暴使者、最后的哀歌和罗特温--已经向索拉-凯尔的女儿们宣誓。其他航班仍在山中与世隔绝。其中最大的是 \"风嚎者\"，其领袖 \"血字的卡兰 \"鄙视女巫。",
	"{@b Kethelrax the Cunning}. The kobold lord Kethelrax has laid claim to Shaarat Kol in the south of Droaam and leads host of kobolds and goblins—creatures that have been traditionally enslaved and oppressed by the larger and more powerful inhabitants of the region. Though his epithet, \"the Cunning,\" is used mockingly by other warlords, Kethelrax has the favor of Sora Katra and has proven to be clever in his own right. The kobolds are thrilled to have their own territory and are fiercely loyal to the Daughters, but many yearn for revenge against their former masters.": "{@b Kethelrax the Cunning}. 哥布林领主凯特拉克斯（Kethelrax）在德罗阿姆南部的沙拉特科尔（Shaarat Kol）建立了自己的领地，并领导着哥布林和地精的主人--这些生物历来被该地区更大、更强大的居民所奴役和压迫。虽然他的绰号 \"狡猾的人 \"被其他军阀嘲笑，但凯特拉克斯得到了索拉-卡特拉的青睐，并证明他自己很聪明。哥布林们为拥有自己的领地而感到兴奋，并对女儿们非常忠诚，但许多人渴望对他们以前的主人进行报复。",
	"{@b Sheshka, the Queen of Stone.} The medusas have long held the ancient citadel of Cazhaak Draal. Though they are not numerous, their deadly gaze and trained basilisk pets make the medusas a force to be reckoned with.

	"{@b Venom Lords}. A group of tieflings called the Venom Lords leads a community of warlocks, some of whom are also tieflings.

	"Droaam emerged as a nation in the final decade of the Last War.

	"In the aftermath of the war, the fighting forces of Droaam have become a significant resource for other nations of Khorvaire. Gnolls, minotaurs, ogres, and other creatures have proven to be capable mercenaries and laborers, and the Daughters have worked with House Tharashk to make these resources available to the rest of Khorvaire. This exchange both puts gold into the Daughters' coffers, and spreads their eyes and ears throughout the wider world.": "在战争结束后，Droaam的战斗力量已经成为Khorvaire其他国家的重要资源。地精、牛头人、食人魔和其他生物被证明是有能力的雇佣兵和劳动者，女儿们与塔拉什克家族合作，将这些资源提供给霍尔韦尔的其他国家。这种交换既为女儿们的国库注入了黄金，又将她们的眼睛和耳朵传播到了更广阔的世界。",
	"When involving the Daughters of Sora Kell in your campaign, the first question you need to answer is: what are their goals for Droaam?": "当让索拉-凯尔的女儿们参与你的活动时，你需要回答的第一个问题是：他们对德罗阿姆的目标是什么？",
	"One possibility is that the Daughters believe in their nation—that it is important to them to unite the monsters of Droaam and to give their charges a voice in the world. In this case, the Daughters can be ultimately sympathetic figures. They are fighting against the fears and prejudices of the people of the Five Nations, and also the selfish ambitions of many of their own power-hungry warlords. Once the adventurers learn that the Daughters truly want peace and prosperity, they could become envoys of the Daughters in the Five Nations or help to fight their enemies in Droaam. A character of a monstrous race could even become a warlord of Droaam. Even if the adventurers don't work directly with the Daughters, they could have need of their assistance; Sora Teraza might hold the answer to a vital mystery, or the adventurers might need an artifact hidden in the vaults of the Great Crag.": "一种可能性是，女儿们相信她们的国家--对她们来说，团结Droaam的怪物并让她们的指控在世界范围内有发言权是很重要的。在这种情况下，女儿们最终可以成为令人同情的人物。他们正在与五国人民的恐惧和偏见作斗争，也在与许多渴望权力的军阀们的自私野心作斗争。一旦冒险者了解到女儿会真正想要和平与繁荣，他们就可以成为女儿会在五国的特使，或者帮助打击他们在德罗阿姆的敌人。一个畸形种族的角色甚至可以成为德罗阿姆的军阀。即使冒险者不直接与女儿会合作，他们也可能需要女儿会的帮助；索拉-泰拉扎可能掌握着一个重要谜团的答案，或者冒险者可能需要一个隐藏在大峭壁的金库中的神器。",
	"If you'd rather use the Daughters as straightforward villains, they could be driven by a thirst for power or a desire to end humanity's dominance over Khorvaire. Sora Teraza's visions enable them to target enemies with unerring precision and reveal enemy plans before they are carried out. Can the adventurers find a way to deal with Sora Teraza and end this threat before the armies of Droaam and agents of Daask make their move?": "如果你愿意把女儿们当作直接的反派，她们可以被对权力的渴求或结束人类对Khorvaire的统治的愿望所驱动。索拉-泰拉扎的幻觉使他们能够准确无误地瞄准敌人，并在敌人的计划实施之前就将其揭露出来。冒险家们能否找到办法对付索拉-泰拉扎，并在德罗阿姆的军队和达斯克的特工行动之前结束这一威胁？",
	"A middle-of-the-road view is that the Daughters are motivated solely by Sora Teraza's visions. They have no interest in gaining power or in maintaining their kingdom; they are fulfilling their role in a story that is still unfolding, and once it's resolved, they will abandon their thrones and return to their hidden haunts. Can Droaam survive without the Daughters, or will the nation dissolve into chaos?": "一种中庸的观点是，女儿们的动机完全是为了索拉-特拉扎的幻觉。她们对获得权力或维持自己的王国没有兴趣；她们正在履行自己在一个仍在展开的故事中的角色，一旦故事得到解决，她们就会放弃她们的王位，回到她们隐藏的地方。在没有女儿们的情况下，Droaam能否生存下去，还是国家会陷入混乱？",
	"Whatever path you choose should also be reflected in the nature of the criminal organization Daask, described later in this chapter.

Over fifteen thousand years ago, the green dragon Vvaraak came to the Shadow Marches and gathered a following from among the orcs of the region. In her studies of the Prophecy, Vvaraak had foreseen a great threat that could be stopped only by the younger races. So she taught the orcs the secret language of the natural world and showed them how to work with stone and soil, and how to read the future in the movement of the Ring of Siberys. She charged her students to remain ever vigilant against the threat that was to come, and to protect nature from those that would corrupt it.": "守门人保持着霍尔韦尔上最古老的德鲁伊传统。一万五千多年前，绿龙Vvaraak来到暗影沼泽，在该地区的兽人中聚集了一批追随者。在对预言的研究中，维瓦拉克预见到了一个只有年轻种族才能阻止的巨大威胁。因此，她教给兽人自然界的秘密语言，告诉他们如何使用石头和土壤，以及如何从西伯利亚之环的运动中解读未来。她要求她的学生对即将到来的威胁保持警惕，并保护自然不被那些人破坏。",
	"Thousands of years later, the daelkyr (see {@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}) opened gates from the plane of Xoriat and unleashed hordes of mind flayers, beholders, and other foul creatures into the world. The conflict that followed destroyed the goblin empire of Dhakaan, and the daelkyr's invasion left scars across Khorvaire. Ultimately, Vvaraak's students sealed the gates and imprisoned the daelkyr in Khyber. Even after this triumph, the orcs couldn't be sure if they had turned back the threat Vvaraak had foreseen, or if a greater danger lay ahead. So, in addition to guarding the seals that bind the daelkyr and keep Xoriat at bay, the Gatekeepers remained vigilant against the possibility of worse to come.": "几千年后，daelkyr（见{@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}）从Xoriat位面打开了大门，并将成群结队的心魔、beholders和其他肮脏的生物释放到这个世界上。随后的冲突摧毁了达卡安（Dhakaan）的地精帝国，而达尔凯尔（daelkyr）的入侵在整个霍尔韦尔留下了伤痕。最终，维瓦拉克的学生们封住了大门，并将达尔凯尔人囚禁在凯博尔。即使在这次胜利之后，兽人也不能确定他们是否已经击退了瓦拉亚克所预见的威胁，或者说更大的危险还在后面。因此，除了守卫束缚达尔凯尔的封印和阻止索里亚特之外，守门人还对可能出现的更坏情况保持着警惕。",
	"In the millennia since that struggle ended, the Gatekeepers have shared Vvaraak's wisdom and druidic magic with humans, shifters, and others who came to Khorvaire. New interpretations of Vvaraak's teachings gave birth to new druid sects: the Wardens of the Wood, the Greensingers, and the Ashbound. Today, the Gatekeepers are one of the smaller sects, and many of the sites of their long-ago battles have been abandoned and forgotten. But some Gatekeepers still remain in the Shadow Marches and the Eldeen Reaches, continuing their vigil to this day.": "在这场斗争结束后的几千年里，守门人与人类、变身者和其他来到霍尔韦尔的人分享了弗瓦拉克的智慧和德鲁伊魔法。对Vvaraak教义的新解释催生了新的德鲁伊教派：森林守护者、绿化者和灰烬束缚者。今天，守门人是较小的教派之一，他们很久以前的战斗遗址很多都已经被遗弃和遗忘。但是一些守门人仍然留在阴影地带和艾尔迪恩河谷，继续他们的守夜工作到今天。",
	"The Last War had only minimal impact on the Gatekeepers, and vice versa. The druids' primary concern was to prevent military activity from disrupting the seals they guarded. Occasionally the Gatekeepers attacked groups of scouts or military patrols, driving them away to ensure that battles didn't erupt in their vicinity. Sometimes the Gatekeepers failed in those efforts, and Xoriat's corruption spread over some remote regions while the war raged around them.": "最后的战争对守门人的影响很小，反之亦然。德鲁伊们最关心的是防止军事活动扰乱他们所守护的封印。守门人偶尔会攻击侦察兵或军事巡逻队，把他们赶走，以确保战斗不会在他们附近爆发。有时守门人在这些努力中失败了，Xoriat的腐败在一些偏远地区蔓延，而战争在他们周围肆虐。",
	"The seals forged by the Gatekeepers have a variety of purposes and forms. Some are tied to specific daelkyr, keeping those individuals bound in Khyber and stripping them of some of their powers. Others ward against aberrations in general, or suppress the influence of the plane of Xoriat. Some seals are amulets, objects that can be carried and stolen. It's said that one of the seals is a druidic bloodline, and it will last until the last member of the line is slain.": "守门人所铸造的封印有各种不同的目的和形式。有些封印与特定的守护者联系在一起，将这些人束缚在开伯尔，并剥夺他们的一些力量。其他的则是为了防止一般的反常现象，或者抑制Xoriat平面的影响。有些封印是护身符，是可以携带和盗窃的物品。据说其中一个封印是德鲁伊的血脉，它将持续到该血脉的最后一个成员被杀。",
	"The most common form of Gatekeeper seal is a great stone slab set into the ground or a cavern wall. It is carved with mystical symbols that hedge out the influence of Xoriat and maintain the barrier. The map depicts one such seal, along with the druidic trappings and dwellings surrounding it.": "最常见的守门人封印形式是一块巨大的石板，镶嵌在地面或岩洞的墙壁上。石板上刻有神秘的符号，可以避开Xoriat的影响，维持屏障。这张地图描绘了一个这样的封印，以及它周围的德鲁伊装备和住所。",
	"Map 4.4 shows what a Gatekeeper seal might look like. A seal is a protected site, usually attended at all times by Gatekeepers who live at or near the seal. The one depicted in the map lies on the edge of a swamp, but it could be located in any kind of terrain. A circle of standing stones serves to focus the magic of the area toward the seal itself, and the stones also serve as a place of worship for the druids' devotions and ceremonies.": "地图4.4显示了守门人封条可能的样子。封印是一个受保护的场所，通常由住在封印处或附近的守门人随时照看。地图中描述的封印位于沼泽地的边缘，但它可以位于任何地形。一圈站立的石头可以将该地区的魔力集中到封印本身，而这些石头也是德鲁伊们的奉献和仪式的崇拜场所。",

	"At certain points in a campaign, the Gatekeepers might seem to be villains. The druids' mission to protect their seals and to oppose the rise of aberrations is of the utmost importance. Anyone who threatens a seal or assists the machinations of the daelkyr, no matter how unwittingly, risks making relentless enemies in the Gatekeepers. A simple shift in circumstances, such as the death of a noble that causes ownership of a trackless parcel of land to change hands, could bring the characters into sudden conflict with the Gatekeepers.": "在战役的某些时候，守门人可能看起来是反派。德鲁伊们的使命是保护他们的封印，反对畸形人的崛起，这是最重要的。任何威胁到封印的人或协助daelkyr的阴谋的人，无论多么不知情，都有可能在守门人那里树起无情的敌人。一个简单的情况变化，例如一个贵族的死亡导致一块无轨土地的所有权易手，都可能使人物与守门人发生突然冲突。",

	"But there is one obstacle to their rise: the Heirs of Dhakaan have no emperor. The goblinoids are divided into clans, and each clan, or {@i kech}, believes its leader has the right to control all the others. And so the champions of Dhakaan continuously compete with each other to prove their right to rule. The Kech Sharaat (Bladebearers) believe that leadership is best achieved through force of arms. The Kech Volaar (Wordbearers) believe that knowledge is the greater weapon, and they seek to recover artifacts and weapons that were lost when the empire fell. These and several less influential clans are competing for overall leadership, while the spies and assassins of the Khesh'dar (Silent Folk) remain neutral in the struggle, gathering information on the modern world and serving every clan.": "但他们的崛起有一个障碍：达卡安的继承者们没有皇帝。妖精们被分为几个部族，每个部族，或者说{@i kech}，都认为其领袖有权控制所有其他部族。因此，达卡安的冠军们不断相互竞争，以证明他们的统治权。Kech Sharaat（持刀人）认为，领导权最好通过武力来实现。Kech Volaar (Wordbearers)相信知识是更大的武器，他们寻求恢复帝国灭亡时丢失的文物和武器。这些部族和几个影响力较小的部族正在争夺整体领导权，而Khesh'dar（沉默的民族）的间谍和刺客在这场斗争中保持中立，收集关于现代世界的信息并为每个部族服务。",
	"At the moment, the Heirs of Dhakaan are maintaining a low profile. They fight most of their battles underground, and occasionally dispatch small squads to carry out missions on the surface.

The truth of the matter is gradually spreading within Darguun, but no one yet realizes the power of the force that lies beneath their nation.": "目前，达卡安的继承者们保持着低调。他们的大部分战斗都是在地下进行的，偶尔也会派遣小队到地面上执行任务。人类通常对地精没有足够的了解，无法分辨达卡尼人和达尔古恩人的区别。这件事的真相正在达尔古恩内部逐渐传播，但还没有人意识到隐藏在他们国家下面的力量的力量。",
	"The Last War caused the Heirs of Dhakaan to finally stir and emerge from their deep vaults. They recognize that humanity has been weakened by its self-inflicted wounds. The rise of Darguun and the proliferation of that nation's Ghaal'dar mercenaries enables the Dhakaani to move around Khorvaire without drawing undue attention. And the Mourning, ultimately, demonstrated that the races of the Five Nations could not be trusted with ruling Khorvaire. It was time for the Dhakaani to return and subjugate the other races to their firm hand once again.": "最后的战争使达卡安的继承人终于蠢蠢欲动，从他们深藏的地窖中走了出来。他们认识到，人类已经被自己造成的创伤所削弱了。达尔古恩的崛起和该国Ghaal'dar雇佣兵的激增，使达卡尼人能够在霍尔韦尔周围活动而不引起不必要的注意。而哀伤，最终证明了五国的种族不能被信任来统治Khorvaire。现在是达卡尼人回来的时候了，他们要再次将其他种族征服在他们坚定的手中。",
	"All across Darguun, the Heirs of Dhakaan are reclaiming surviving remnants of their fallen empire, and they even cautiously range out into surrounding nations.

If more than one of the characters fought in the war, did they serve together (or as allies) or fight on opposing sides? Military service can be the basis of a strong connection for two or more characters.": "{@b Military Service}. 该人物是否参加过战争？如果是的话，他们为哪个国家服务，担任什么角色？如果不止一个人物参加了战争，他们是一起服役（或作为盟友）还是在对立面作战？军事服务可以成为两个或更多人物之间强有力联系的基础。",
	"{@b Civilian Life}. If the character is from one of the Five Nations and didn't fight in the war, how and why did they remain on the sidelines? Did they oppose the war? Did they do something to avoid conscription, or was there a reason they were considered unsuitable for service?": "{@b Civilian Life}. 如果该人物来自五国之一，没有参战，他们是如何以及为什么保持旁观状态的？他们反对战争吗？他们是否做了一些事情来避免征兵，或者有什么原因使他们被认为不适合服役？",
	"{@b Personal Loss}. What did the characters lose during the war? Did members of their family die, and if so, how? Was the village they grew up in destroyed, and if so, who was responsible? If the characters are from Cyre, they have lost their nation. Do they have any loved ones left? Did they spend time in a refugee camp or in the outpost of New Cyre in Breland? Do they support Prince Oargev as the leader of Cyre, or do they have other ideas for the nation's future?": "{@b Personal Loss}. 这些人物在战争中失去了什么？他们的家庭成员是否死亡，如果是的话，是如何死亡的？他们长大的村庄是否被摧毁，如果是，是谁造成的？如果人物来自赛尔，他们失去了自己的国家。他们还有亲人吗？他们是在难民营还是在布雷兰的新赛尔前哨度过的？他们是否支持奥格夫王子作为赛尔的领袖，或者他们对国家的未来有其他想法？",
	"For example, when an Aundairan player character meets a group of Eldeen druids, it's an opportunity to exploit the bad blood between Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches and to determine if this interaction has any personal relevance to the character. If a player character has the soldier background, you can introduce an NPC as a former comrade and work out the details with the player on the spot. The Personal Impact table provides ideas for plot hooks that could directly involve a player character in a scenario.": "例如，当一个Aundairan的玩家角色遇到一群Eldeen德鲁伊时，这是一个利用Aundair和Eldeen Reaches之间的不和的机会，并确定这种互动是否与该角色有任何个人关系。如果玩家角色有士兵背景，你可以引入一个NPC作为以前的战友，并在现场与玩家一起解决细节问题。个人影响表提供了可以直接让玩家角色参与场景的情节钩子的想法。",
	"A former comrade-in-arms asks a player character for help.": "一个曾经的战友向玩家角色寻求帮助。",
	"One of the adventurers is from a place destroyed during the war; refugees from that location ask for their help.": "其中一个冒险家来自一个在战争中被摧毁的地方；来自那个地方的难民请求他们帮助。",
	"One of the characters served with the villain during the war, and the villain betrayed them or their nation.": "其中一个角色在战争期间与反派一起服役，而反派背叛了他们或他们的国家。",
	"The villain was the cruel commander of a camp where one of the characters was held as a prisoner of war.": "恶棍是一个营地的残酷指挥官，其中一个角色作为战俘被关押在那里。",
	"One of the adventurers made a promise to a comrade during the war, and achieving the goal of the adventure will fulfill that promise.": "其中一个冒险家在战争期间对一个战友做出了承诺，实现冒险的目标将实现这个承诺。",
	"The adventure revolves around something one of the characters saw during the war: a powerful weapon, an unusual battlefield, or a unique warforged.": "冒险围绕着某个角色在战争中看到的东西展开：一件强大的武器，一个不寻常的战场，或者一个独特的战争锻工。",
	"Alliances shifted during the war, and almost every nation has grievances with every other one. Some of these postwar feuds rage more fiercely than others. One of these sources of tension could play a role in a character's back story, the plot of an adventure, or the reactions of an NPC. Although the nations are afraid to return to all-out war, any of these feuds could escalate.": "战争期间，联盟发生了变化，几乎每个国家都对其他国家心怀不满。这些战后的恩怨，有些比其他的更激烈。这些紧张的来源之一可以在角色的背景故事、冒险的情节或NPC的反应中发挥作用。尽管各国都害怕回到全面战争中，但任何这些争斗都可能升级。",
	"Forty years ago, the farmers of western Aundair joined with the druids of the Towering Woods in seceding from the kingdom and founding the Eldeen Reaches. Most Aundairians consider this an unforgivable act of treason committed at a time of national weakness. The Reachers say their actions were precipitated by the neglect and corruption of the Aundairian nobles. Now that the war is over, many Aundairians believe Queen Aurala should reclaim the Eldeen Reaches, whether through diplomacy or force.": "四十年前，昂代尔西部的农民与塔林的德鲁伊一起脱离了王国，建立了艾尔迪恩河谷。大多数昂代尔人认为这是在国家衰弱时犯下的不可饶恕的叛国行为。猎手们说他们的行动是由于昂代尔贵族的忽视和腐败而促成的。现在战争结束了，许多昂代尔人认为奥拉拉女王应该收回艾尔迪恩河谷，无论是通过外交还是武力。",
	"Monstrous raiders from the western wilderness have plagued Breland for centuries. A decade ago, the Daughters of Sora Kell united the scattered warlords of the region under the flag of Droaam. Furious clashes erupted between Breland and Droaam, centering on the fortress of Orcbone and Brelish settlers in the west. Breland led the opposition to recognizing Droaam as a nation under the Treaty of Thronehold, and some Brelish believe King Boranel should take dramatic action to end this threat.": "几个世纪以来，来自西部荒野的怪物突袭者一直困扰着布雷兰。十年前，索拉-凯尔的女儿们将该地区分散的军阀们联合在德罗阿姆的旗下。布雷兰和德罗阿姆之间爆发了激烈的冲突，主要集中在西部的奥克邦要塞和布雷利什定居者。布雷兰带头反对根据《王权条约》承认德罗阿姆是一个国家，一些布雷利什人认为博拉内尔国王应该采取戏剧性的行动来结束这种威胁。",
	"Cyrans maintain that they alone were in the right during the Last War, which began when the other nations refused to acknowledge the Cyran queen's rightful claim to the throne of Galifar. Proud until the end, Cyre clashed with all the other nations. Now Cyre is destroyed, and Cyran refugees everywhere are dependent on the kindness of their former enemies. But many of those people believe that Cyre deserves no mercy, and that the refugees should be treated as enemy combatants rather than offered charity and compassion.": "赛尔人坚持认为，在最后一次战争中，只有他们才是正确的，这场战争是在其他国家拒绝承认赛尔女王对加利法尔王位的合法要求时开始的。骄傲的是直到最后，赛尔与所有其他国家发生了冲突。现在，赛尔被摧毁了，各地的赛尔人难民要依靠他们以前的敌人的善意。但这些人中有许多人认为赛尔不值得怜悯，难民应该被当作敌方的战斗人员，而不是得到慈善和同情。",
	"The enmity between these two nations runs far deeper and longer than what was wrought by the Last War. Thrane is the bastion of the Church of the Silver Flame, while Karrnath resorted to necromancy in the course of the war. Thranes accuse Karrns of being morally bankrupt; Karrns say that the Thranes are arrogant and naive. This long-standing rivalry led to intense conflict in the early days of the war, and it only grew worse. When Thrane became a theocracy, Karrns seized on this act as proof that the nation had abandoned the traditions of Galifar. When Karrnath integrated undead into its armies, Thrane swore it would never be at peace with those who would use such foul magic. Both nations have accepted the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold, and the Karrnathi king has forsworn the creation of new undead soldiers, but the treaty has done nothing to ease the enmity between the two.": "这两个国家之间的敌意远比最后一次战争所造成的更深更久。瑟兰是银焰教会的堡垒，而卡尔纳斯则在战争过程中求助于死灵法术。瑟兰指责卡尔纳斯道德沦丧；卡尔纳斯则说瑟兰人傲慢而天真。这种长期的竞争导致了战争初期的激烈冲突，而且情况只会越来越糟。当瑟兰成为一个神权国家时，卡尔恩斯抓住这一行为作为该国家放弃加利法尔传统的证据。当卡尔纳斯将亡灵纳入其军队时，瑟兰发誓它将永远不会与那些使用这种肮脏魔法的人和平相处。两国都接受了《王座条约》的条款，卡尔纳特国王也放弃了制造新的亡灵士兵，但该条约对缓解两国之间的敌意毫无作用。",
	"The ancient city of Thaliost was once part of Aundair, and it has many proud ties to the history of that nation. It was seized by Thrane during the Last War, and the Treaty of Thronehold ratified its occupation of the place. Thrane placed an Aundairian archbishop, Solgar Dariznu, in charge of the city, and it has become a haven for Aundairian followers of the Silver Flame. But many of its citizens consider themselves to be Aundairians, and many prominent citizens of Aundair are putting great pressure on Queen Aurala to retake the city. The tension has been exacerbated by Archbishop Dariznu, who has taken brutal action to suppress Aundairian opposition to Thrane's occupation of the city.": "塔利奥斯特古城曾经是昂代尔的一部分，它与那个国家的历史有着许多令人骄傲的联系。它在最后一次战争中被瑟兰夺取，《瑟兰条约》批准了其对该地的占领。瑟兰安排了一位昂代尔大主教，索尔加-达里兹努（Solgar Dariznu），负责管理这座城市，它已经成为昂代尔银色火焰追随者的天堂。但它的许多公民认为自己是昂代尔人，而且昂代尔的许多知名公民对奥拉拉女王施加了巨大的压力，要求夺回该城。大主教Dariznu加剧了这种紧张局势，他采取了残酷的行动来镇压昂代尔人对瑟兰占领城市的反对。",
	"The elves of Valenar have broken the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold on several occasions. They regularly antagonize their neighbors, raiding and provoking everyone in reach of their war bands; some independent war bands have even crossed the Talenta Plains to raid across the borders of Karrnath and Q'barra. High King Vadallia insists that these are the actions of individual soldiers, but he refuses to take action against the perpetrators. Some scholars believe Vadallia and the Valenar are trying to provoke a full-scale conflict—by the strictures of their religion they don't want to be conquerors, but they want a powerful enemy to attack their nation. If this hypothesis is true, they might continue to escalate their activity until Karrnath or another powerful nation is forced to react.": "瓦勒纳的精灵们曾多次违反《王权条约》的条款。他们经常与邻国为敌，袭击和挑衅他们的战队所能触及的每一个人；一些独立的战队甚至越过塔伦塔平原，跨越卡尔纳特和Q'barra的边界进行袭击。大国王瓦达利亚坚持认为这些是个别士兵的行为，但他拒绝对肇事者采取行动。一些学者认为，瓦达利亚和瓦勒纳人正试图挑起一场全面的冲突--根据他们宗教的严格规定，他们不想成为征服者，但他们希望有一个强大的敌人来攻击他们的国家。如果这个假设是真的，他们可能会继续升级他们的活动，直到卡尔纳特或其他强大的国家被迫做出反应。",
	"Though the Valenar regularly raid their neighbors, these attacks rarely target civilians. The elves aren't interested in wealth or territory; they are looking for challenging battles. They might attack military outposts, patrols, adventurers, or other brigands—any force that seems like it could put up a good fight.": "虽然瓦勒纳人经常袭击他们的邻居，但这些袭击很少针对平民。精灵们对财富或领土并不感兴趣；他们正在寻找具有挑战性的战斗。他们可能会攻击军事前哨、巡逻队、冒险者或其他强盗--任何看起来可以打一场漂亮仗的力量。",
	"There's no place in Khorvaire that escaped the Last War unscathed. Even villages that were never attacked lost their children to conscription or suffered from shortages. Some towns far from the front lines suffered damage from long-distance magic weapons or terror attacks. Any time you are setting a scene, you could add some element that speaks to the ongoing impact of the Last War. The Everyday Impact table offers some suggestions for these elements.": "在霍尔韦尔，没有一个地方能毫发无损地躲过上次战争。即使是那些从未被攻击过的村庄也因征兵而失去了他们的孩子，或遭受短缺的困扰。一些远离前线的城镇受到远程魔法武器或恐怖袭击的破坏。在设置场景的任何时候，你都可以添加一些元素，说明最后战争的持续影响。日常影响表为这些元素提供了一些建议。",
	"A supply shortage is causing tension in the community. This shortage could be of a basic commodity (such as bread), a luxury item (such as wine), or an important service.": "供应短缺正在引起社区的紧张。这种短缺可能是基本商品（如面包）、奢侈品（如酒）或重要服务的短缺。",
	"Demonstrators in the streets are protesting against refugees or warforged, urging a return to war, complaining about shortages or neglect, or drawing attention to the needs of veterans, refugees, or others.": "街上的示威者正在抗议难民或战争伪造者，敦促恢复战争，抱怨短缺或忽视，或提请注意退伍军人、难民或其他人的需求。",
	"A disabled veteran shares war stories while begging for copper.": "一位残疾老兵在乞讨铜钱时分享战争故事。",
	"A crowd has gathered around two people engaged in a heated discussion about the war.": "一群人聚集在两个人的周围，对战争进行激烈的讨论。",
	"A street vendor is selling unusual souvenirs from the war—pieces of a warforged titan, shards of an airship, and other curiosities.": "一个街头小贩正在出售来自战争的不寻常的纪念品--一个被锻造的泰坦的碎片，一艘飞艇的碎片，以及其他奇怪的东西。",
	"A memorial has been raised to commemorate members of the community lost in the war.": "为了纪念在战争中丧生的社区成员，已经建立了一座纪念碑。",
	"No one knows what caused the Mourning, and the fear of repeating this cataclysm—not the Treaty of Thronehold—is what keeps potential combatants at bay. No one is happy with the outcome of the war, but no one dares to continue fighting, since all believe that renewed full-scale conflict could result in utter destruction. That said, the general belief is that the mystery of the Mourning will eventually be solved. Either someone will learn how to control the power that caused the Mournland, or the precise cause will be determined and people will be able to tell if it still poses a threat.": "没有人知道是什么原因导致了哀悼，对重蹈覆辙的恐惧--而不是《王权条约》--是让潜在的战斗人员望而却步的原因。没有人对战争的结果感到满意，但没有人敢于继续战斗，因为所有人都认为再次发生全面冲突会导致彻底的毁灭。尽管如此，人们普遍认为，\"哀号 \"之谜最终会被解开。要么有人会学会如何控制造成哀牢的力量，要么精确的原因会被确定，人们将能够判断它是否仍然构成威胁。",
	"Many people truly hope that the Last War will live up to its name forever. But others prepare for more war even as they pursue peace. First and foremost, every nation wants to unravel the mystery of the Mourning; a nation that could learn how to use this power would be unstoppable. Other forces are searching for weapons or forgotten powers that could turn the tide if another war breaks out. Adventurers could find themselves racing through ruins in Xen'drik, trying to destroy a weapon of the ancient giants before the Emerald Claw can claim it for Karrnath and {@creature Lady Illmarrow|ERLW}.": "许多人真心希望 \"最后的战争 \"能永远名副其实。但其他人即使在追求和平的同时也在为更多的战争做准备。首先，每个国家都想揭开 \"哀伤 \"的神秘面纱；一个能学会如何使用这种力量的国家将是不可阻挡的。其他势力则在寻找武器或被遗忘的力量，如果另一场战争爆发，它们可以扭转局势。冒险家们可能会发现自己在Xen'drik的废墟中飞奔，试图在翡翠之爪为Karrnath和{@creature Lady Illmarrow|ERLW}索取它之前摧毁古代巨人的武器。",
	"The characters can stumble into a web of intrigue without seeing the sticky strands. Perhaps a patron hires the adventurers to transport what seems to be an ordinary backpack full of goods, and they don't realize that it has a secret magical compartment until enemy spies come looking for whatever is inside it. Or a dying spy presses an amulet into the hand of one of the adventurers, saying, \"The fate of Breland depends on you getting this to Boranel. Don't trust anyone!\" Assuming the adventurers care about the fate of Breland, they're pressed into an urgent adventure that has implications they might not see or understand.": "角色们可以在没有看到粘性线的情况下误入一个阴谋的网络。也许一个赞助人雇佣冒险者去运送一个看似普通的装满货物的背包，而他们并没有意识到这个背包有一个秘密的魔法隔间，直到敌人的间谍来寻找里面的东西。或者一个垂死的间谍把一个护身符压在一个冒险者的手上，说：\"布雷兰德的命运取决于你把这个东西送到博拉内尔。不要相信任何人！\" 假设冒险家们关心布瑞兰的命运，他们就会被逼着进行一次紧急的冒险，而这个冒险的意义他们可能看不到也不明白。",
	"In your campaign, you might want to take a look back at the war as it unfolds. Setting an adventure during the Last War puts the characters in a tumultuous time of political intrigue, tenuous alliances, and brutal conflicts. Consider these ways to make the Last War a present reality in your campaign:": "在你的活动中，你可能想回顾一下战争的发展。在 \"最后战争 \"期间设置一个冒险，会使角色处于一个政治阴谋、脆弱的联盟和残酷的冲突的动荡时期。请考虑这些方法，使最后战争成为你的活动中的现实。",
	"The players create new characters who live during a specific phase of the war. These characters could be figures of legend whose great deeds are known to the present-day characters, or they could be unknowns caught up in events much larger than themselves. In either case, the adventure they undertake can set the stage for events in the \"present day\" of your campaign.": "玩家创建新的角色，他们生活在战争的特定阶段。这些角色可能是传奇人物，他们的伟大事迹为现在的角色所熟知，或者他们可能是被卷入比自己大得多的事件中的未知人物。无论哪种情况，他们所进行的冒险都可以为你的战役中的 \"今天 \"的事件奠定基础。",
	"You might run an introductory session or flashback set during the waning years of the war, bringing the characters' backgrounds to life. Maybe the characters are all part of the same unit in the war, or they might be enemies forced to cooperate when disaster strikes. Are the characters participants in a memorable battle? Do they take actions they'll later regret? Do they make a bitter enemy who comes back to haunt them years later, when the campaign continues in the present day?": "你可以开展一个介绍性的会议，或在战争的最后几年进行闪回，使人物的背景变得生动。也许这些人物在战争中都是同一单位的成员，或者他们可能是敌人，在灾难来临时被迫合作。这些人物是一场令人难忘的战斗的参与者吗？他们是否采取了后来会后悔的行动？他们是否结交了一个痛苦的敌人，多年后，当战役在今天继续进行时，这个敌人又会来纠缠他们？",
	"A magical phenomenon might send the characters back in time, putting them in the middle of the conflict. Are they transported there to learn something? To alter the course of history? Or are they just stranded in a twisted time stream? How will they escape the horrors of the war and get back to their own time?": "一个神奇的现象可能会让人物回到过去，使他们处于冲突之中。他们被送到那里是为了学习什么吗？改变历史的进程？还是他们只是被困在一个扭曲的时间流中？他们将如何逃离战争的恐怖，回到自己的时代？",
	"Just as adventurers are shaped by their experiences in the Last War, villains often carry the physical and mental scars of the conflict. When developing the details of a villain's background, consider the following options.": "就像冒险家们被他们在最后战争中的经历所塑造一样，反派常常带着冲突的身体和精神伤痕。在制定反派的背景细节时，请考虑以下选项。",
	"Something the villain saw or experienced during the war made a lasting impression that still drives them today. Perhaps their family was killed in a senseless attack, and everything they are doing is motivated by a desire to avenge this loss. Maybe they think that they were betrayed by their own nation. Perhaps they were caught in the Mourning, and even though they somehow survived it, what they lived through drove them insane.": "小人在战争期间看到或经历的一些事情给他们留下了深刻的印象，至今仍在推动他们。也许他们的家人在一次毫无意义的袭击中被杀，他们所做的一切都出于为这一损失报仇的愿望。也许他们认为自己被自己的国家出卖了。也许他们被卷入了哀悼会，尽管他们以某种方式幸存下来，但他们所经历的一切使他们发疯。",
	"A former comrade-in-arms can be a useful hook to draw adventurers into a story—or a compelling villain. Which one of the characters served alongside the villain? Were they equals, or was one of higher rank? Did the villain abandon or betray the adventurer, or was it the adventurer who betrayed the villain? This option can be especially interesting for a warforged villain; while searching for their own identity following the war, they have embraced a dark path. If you use this motif, it's important to develop the story in conjunction with the players whose characters are connected to the villain—either establishing crucial details ahead of time, or developing them together by way of a flashback.": "昔日的战友可以成为吸引冒险者进入故事的一个有用的钩子，或者是一个引人注目的反派。哪一个角色曾与反派并肩作战？他们是平等的，还是有一个人的级别更高？是反派抛弃或背叛了冒险家，还是冒险家背叛了反派？这个选项对于一个被战争锻造的反派来说可能特别有趣；在战争之后寻找自己的身份时，他们拥抱了一条黑暗的道路。如果你使用这个主题，重要的是与那些角色与反派有联系的玩家一起发展故事--要么提前确定关键细节，要么通过倒叙的方式一起发展。",
	"At first meeting, the villain of an adventure might seem to be a person of honor, or at the least a hardscrabble survivor doing what they think is right after surviving the war. The villain might have experienced some of the same things in the war that the characters did, making it easy for the characters to understand the villain's point of view—or at least to harbor a sliver of doubt that makes them think twice before rushing to condemn the villain. The War-Torn Villains table suggests twists you can add to villains mentioned elsewhere in this chapter to give them and their schemes a tie to the Last War.": "初次见面，冒险中的反派可能是一个有荣誉感的人，或者至少是一个在战争中幸存下来的艰苦的幸存者，在做他们认为正确的事情。反派可能在战争中经历了一些与角色相同的事情，这使得角色很容易理解反派的观点，或者至少怀有一丝怀疑，使他们在急于谴责反派之前三思。战争中的恶棍表建议你为本章其他地方提到的恶棍增加一些转折，使他们和他们的计划与最后的战争联系起来。",
	"The villain doesn't know (or refuses to believe) that the war has ended.": "反派不知道（或拒绝相信）战争已经结束。",
	"The villain experienced horrors during the war and targets the people they believe to be responsible.": "小人在战争中经历了恐怖，并把目标对准了他们认为应负责任的人。",

	"Military outposts across Khorvaire serve a variety of purposes during and after the war: rest stops for platoons on the move, garrisons for inactive troops, armories where weapons are stored, staging points for scouts and rangers who keep an eye on nearby enemy movements, and defensive fortifications meant to protect passes, bridges, or other key strategic locations. In an adventure, virtually anything can happen in or around it.": "在战争期间和战争结束后，整个霍尔韦尔的军事前哨有多种用途：移动中的排队的休息站、不活跃的部队的驻扎地、储存武器的军械库、监视附近敌人动向的侦察员和游骑兵的集结点，以及旨在保护通道、桥梁或其他关键战略地点的防御工事。在一次冒险中，几乎任何事情都可以在其中或周围发生。",
	"This outpost, as shown on map 4.5, is a simple building holding barracks, officers' quarters, and storage areas encased within multiple rings of fortification.

	"Stalking the Mournland like a spectral juggernaut, {@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW} has emerged from the turmoil of the Last War as a symbol that calls to all the warforged of Khorvaire. Regardless of what they have become, the warforged were created to fight and die on the orders of their creators. Some warforged accept their history for what it is and look toward the future, but others hold a grudge because of how they were exploited by their creators. Those warforged make up the followers of {@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}.": "像一个幽灵般的巨兽一样在哀伤之地徘徊，{@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}从最后一次战争的动荡中脱颖而出，成为呼唤所有Khorvaire的战争锻造者的象征。不管他们变成了什么，战神被创造出来是为了在他们的创造者的命令下战斗和死亡。一些战神接受了他们的历史，并着眼于未来，但其他战神则因为他们是如何被他们的创造者利用而怀恨在心。这些战神构成了{@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}的追随者。",

Similarly, golems and other constructs were largely unaffected by the Mourning.": "大多数战神没有受到哀伤的影响，而且整个种族似乎对困扰哀伤之地的许多挥之不去的影响免疫。因此，跟随{@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}的战锻人构成了在哀伤之地可以找到的最接近人形社会的东西。同样地，巨兽和其他构造物也基本上没有受到哀伤的影响。",
	"Many Mournland creatures have mutations that are purely cosmetic and don't change their stat blocks. For example, one might have eyes that look like gemstones or might display glowing patterns on its skin or fur.": "许多哀牢地的生物都有纯粹的外观变异，并不改变它们的状态块。例如，一个人可能有一双像宝石一样的眼睛，或者在其皮肤或皮毛上显示发光的图案。",
	"The creature has grown to an unusual size. You can either set its new size and alter its statistics using the guidelines in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, or apply the enlarge effect of the {@spell enlarge/reduce} spell to it.": "这个生物已经长到一个不寻常的大小。你可以使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的准则来设定它的新尺寸并改变它的统计数据，或者对它应用{@spell enlarge/reduce}法术的放大效果。",
	"The creature has developed magical camouflage. It gains proficiency in the {@skill Stealth} skill, and it has the Chameleon Skin trait: it has advantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks made to hide.": "该生物已经发展出神奇的伪装术。它获得了熟练的{@skill Stealth}技能，并具有变色龙皮肤的特性：它在灵巧({@skill Stealth})检查中对隐藏有优势。",
	"The creature has the Magic Resistance trait: it has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.": "该生物具有魔力抵抗的特性：它在对抗法术和其他魔法效果时有优势。",
	"The creature has a supernatural ability to heal its wounds. It has the Regeneration trait: it regains hit points at the start of its turn equal to the maximum value of one of its Hit Dice. If it takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the creature's next turn. (A particular creature might be susceptible to different damage types.) The creature dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.": "该生物有一种超自然的能力来治疗其伤口。它具有再生特性：在其回合开始时恢复的命中率等于其一个命中率的最大值。如果它受到酸或火的伤害，这个特性在该生物的下一回合开始时不会发挥作用。(一个特定的生物可能对不同的伤害类型敏感。）该生物只有在其回合开始时命中率为0并且没有再生时才会死亡。",
	"The creature has two heads. If it has a bite attack, it can use Multiattack as an action to make two bite attacks. (If it already has Multiattack, it adds a bite attack to its attack routine.) It also gains the Two Heads trait: it has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks and on saving throws against being {@condition blinded}, {@condition charmed}, {@condition deafened}, {@condition frightened}, {@condition stunned}, and knocked {@condition unconscious}.": "该生物有两个头。如果它有咬人攻击，它可以使用多重攻击作为一个动作来进行两次咬人攻击。(如果它已经有多重攻击，它会在它的攻击程序中增加一次咬人攻击。)它也获得了双头的特性：它在智慧({@skill Perception})检查和对被{@condition blinded}、{@condition charmed}、{@condition deafened}、{@condition frightened}、{@condition stunned}和被击倒{@condition unconscious}的拯救动作上具有优势。",
	"The catastrophe of the Mourning altered more than the landscape and living creatures. The devastation caused localized alterations in the way magic functions. In some places, magic barely functions, or certain magical functions are warped. In other places, spells persist past the instant of their casting and start behaving as if they were independent, living creatures.": "哀悼的灾难改变的不仅仅是景观和生物。破坏造成了魔法运作方式的局部改变。在一些地方，魔法几乎没有功能，或者某些魔法功能被扭曲了。在其他地方，法术在施放的瞬间仍然存在，并开始表现得好像它们是独立的、活的生物。",
	"A common misunderstanding about the Mournland is that healing spells refuse to work. The fact is that healing spells are impeded within the dead-gray mist, and occasionally in other areas, making it harder for someone to cast them effectively. Because so few expeditions make it far past the mist, the inability to heal is widely assumed to be a property of the Mournland as a whole.": "对哀伤之地的一个常见误解是，治疗法术拒绝发挥作用。事实是，治疗法术在死灰色的迷雾中受到阻碍，偶尔也会在其他地区受到阻碍，这使得某人更难有效地施展法术。因为很少有探险队能远远越过迷雾，所以人们普遍认为无法治疗是整个哀牢地的特性。",
	"The Environmental Effects table provides suggestions for weird magic that might pervade a small or large area of the Mournland. Effects might shift from day to day or even hour to hour.": "环境效应表提供了关于可能弥漫在哀牢地一小片或一大片区域的怪异魔法的建议。这些影响可能会从一天到一天，甚至从一小时到一小时发生变化。",
	"Healing spells are impeded here. Any spell that restores hit points does so as if it were cast at a level one lower than the spell slot expended. A spell cast using a 1st-level slot restores no hit points.": "治疗性法术在此受到阻碍。任何恢复命中率的法术都是在比所使用的法术槽低一个等级的情况下施放的。使用1级法术槽施展的法术不会恢复命中率。",
	"Each creature that enters the area is affected by an {@spell enlarge/reduce} spell, with an equal chance for each effect. The effect lasts until the creature leaves the area.": "每个进入该区域的生物都会受到一个{@spell enlarge/reduce}的法术影响，每个效果的几率相同。效果持续到该生物离开该区域。",
	"The pull of gravity is lessened. Creatures can jump twice the normal distance in any direction, and everything effectively weighs half its actual weight.": "地心引力被减弱。生物可以在任何方向上跳出正常距离的两倍，而且所有东西的重量都是其实际重量的一半。",

	"Of all the bizarre and horrific spectacles of the Mournland, perhaps the greatest tragedy is represented by the ruins of the once-glittering cities of Cyre. Some have been reduced to rubble, while others are eerily preserved, devoid of life but otherwise unharmed. In some of them, treasures left behind by the former inhabitants await discovery, and many people across Khorvaire are eager to get their hands on such spoils for a wide variety of reasons.": "在哀伤之地的所有怪异和恐怖的景象中，也许最大的悲剧是由曾经闪闪发光的赛尔城的废墟所代表。一些城市已经变成了瓦砾，而其他城市则保存得很好，没有生命，但其他方面没有受到伤害。在其中一些城市中，以前的居民留下的宝藏正等待着人们去发现，而整个霍尔韦尔的许多人出于各种原因都急于得到这些战利品。",
	"Cyre was the site of incessant battles during the Last War, from the first extended campaign—the siege of Eston in 895 YK—to the running battle on the Saerun Road that was cut short when the Mourning occurred. Battlefields across the Mournland, both ancient and recent, stand like open graves as evidence of the horrors of the war. In some places, armies that were fighting on the Day of Mourning became stone statues anchored in position. Others were crystallized or reduced to ash.": "赛尔是最后一次战争期间不断发生战斗的地方，从第一次长期战役--895 YK时对埃斯顿的围攻，到哀伤发生时被切断的赛伦路的奔袭战。遍布哀伤之地的战场，无论是古代的还是最近的，都像敞开的坟墓，作为战争恐怖的证据。在一些地方，在哀悼日作战的军队变成了锚定在位置上的石像。其他人则被结晶化或化为灰烬。",
	"On the Field of Ruins—around the Saerun Road in the southwest part of the Mournland, where allied forces of Thrane and Breland battled an outnumbered Cyran army on the Day of Mourning—the fallen soldiers are preserved just as they fell, with no sign of rot or decay.

Even seasoned bands of treasure hunters are loath to enter the Field of Ruins.": "在废墟上--位于哀伤之地西南部的赛伦路周围，在哀伤之日，瑟兰和布雷兰的联军在这里与人数众多的赛伦军队作战--阵亡的士兵就像他们倒下时一样被保存下来，没有腐烂或衰落的迹象。成千上万的尸体散落在战场上，或面朝黄土背朝天，或毫无生气地盯着灰色的天空。即使是经验丰富的寻宝者也不愿意进入废墟之地。",
	"House Cannith was born in Eston, and the house's labors transformed the city into a place of wonders. Clockwork birds perched and sang in silvery trees covered in steel bark. Skycoaches carried smiths and magewrights from forge to forge, and an iridescent dome protected the city from storms and harsh winds. On the proving grounds of the Cannith creation forges, cadres of newborn warforged learned the combat skills that would prepare them for active duty.": "坎尼斯家族诞生于埃斯顿，该家族的劳作将这座城市变成了一个充满奇迹的地方。发条鸟在覆盖着钢皮的银色树木上栖息和歌唱。天车将铁匠和魔法师从一个锻造厂运到另一个锻造厂，一个彩虹色的圆顶保护城市免受风暴和恶劣的风的影响。在坎尼斯创建的锻造厂的试验场上，新生的战争锻造者们学习战斗技能，为他们的现役做准备。",
	"Eston began as a successful mining settlement, extracting iron and rare ores from the nearby hills. Drawing on these resources, the Cannith artificers in Eston spent decades researching all sorts of artificial creatures, which eventually gave rise to the warforged.": "埃斯顿最初是一个成功的采矿定居点，从附近的山丘中提取铁和稀有矿石。利用这些资源，埃斯顿的坎尼斯工匠们花了数十年时间研究各种人造生物，最终产生了战争锻造者。",
	"Because of these wonders, Eston is an irresistible attraction for treasure hunters hoping to access the vaults of House Cannith. Reports suggest, however, that it has become a strange and deadly place. It's said that the city is overrun by living spells. In addition to the remnants of damaging spells (see \"{@book Living Spells|ERLW|13|Living Spells}\" in {@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}), there are stranger phenomena: living {@i continual flames} that crawl along the streets, cling to lampposts, and flee from strangers, and living {@i scrying} spells that shift and shimmer, displaying distant scenes on their amorphous skin.": "由于这些奇迹的存在，埃斯顿对希望进入坎尼斯家族金库的寻宝者来说是一个不可抗拒的吸引力。然而，报告显示，这里已经成为一个奇怪而致命的地方。据说这座城市被活体法术所占据。除了破坏性法术的残余（见{@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}中的\"{@book Living Spells|ERLW|13|Living Spells}\"），还有一些更奇怪的现象：活着的{@i continual flames}沿着街道爬行，依附在灯柱上，并从陌生人面前逃走，还有活着的{@i scrying}法术，它们在无定形的皮肤上变换和闪烁，显示出遥远的场景。",
	"Eston was renowned for its clockwork menagerie and its steel gardens, a showcase that chronicles House Cannith's centuries of work developing constructs and homunculi. These creatures have been twisted by the Mourning and have become deadly monsters. Stories tell of an enormous gorgon golem, of razor-winged swarms of silver songbirds, and many other equally strange things.": "埃斯顿以其钟表动物园和钢铁花园而闻名，这个陈列室记录了坎尼斯家族几个世纪以来开发构装体和同形体的工作。这些生物被哀伤所扭曲，变成了致命的怪兽。故事讲述了一个巨大的戈尔贡巨兽，银色鸣禽的剑翼群，以及其他许多同样奇怪的东西。",
	"Many people believe that the city of Making was at the epicenter of whatever caused the Mourning. The cataclysm reshaped the terrain around the city, creating the great highland formation known as the Glass Plateau.": "许多人认为，Making城是造成哀伤的震中。大灾变重塑了城市周围的地形，形成了被称为玻璃高原的巨大高地。",
	"The Glass Plateau is mostly smooth and flat, though jagged spikes and spires jut up from the ground in seemingly random places. The central portion of the highland plain is obsidian, and bursts of fiery light can sometimes be seen in its dark depths. Toward the edges of the plateau, the glass becomes lighter in color and more transparent, appearing almost pale white along the jagged cliffs at the edge. Nothing grows on the plain of glass, and few creatures haunt its jagged peaks and flat expanse.": "玻璃高原大部分是光滑平坦的，尽管在看似随意的地方有锯齿状的尖峰和尖顶从地面伸出来。高原的中央部分是黑曜石，在其黑暗的深处有时可以看到迸发的火光。在高原的边缘，玻璃的颜色变得更浅，更透明，沿着边缘的锯齿状悬崖看起来几乎是苍白色的。玻璃平原上没有任何东西生长，也没有什么生物在其锯齿状的山峰和平坦的大地上出没。",

	"This city was once the capital of Cyre. Now it lies empty, seemingly waiting along the Cyre River for its people to return. Parts of Metrol have been shattered, their buildings crushed and tumbled by whatever force destroyed the nation. Other portions of the city escaped with superficial damage; aside from the absence of people and the shroud of mist that hangs over the area, it looks much as it did before Cyre fell. The days in Metrol are quiet, but the nights bring a cacophony of chaos and violence to the streets—at night, misshapen monsters emerge from their lairs to prowl and wail as they hunt each other for food.": "这座城市曾经是赛尔的首都。现在它空空如也，似乎在赛尔河畔等待着它的人民回来。梅特罗尔的部分地区已经支离破碎，它们的建筑物被摧毁国家的任何力量压碎和翻滚。城市的其他部分只受到了表面上的损害；除了没有人和笼罩在该地区的雾气之外，它看起来和赛尔城陷落之前差不多。梅特罗尔的白天是安静的，但夜晚给街道带来了混乱和暴力的喧嚣--晚上，畸形的怪物从它们的巢穴里出来，一边游荡一边哀嚎，互相捕食。",
	"Few people have reason to spend time anywhere near the Mournland. Among the exceptions are those who seek to plunder the riches of lost Cyre, such as Ikar's Salvage (described below).

	"House Cannith spent much of the war working on various kinds of constructs that could serve as soldiers, siege engines, or other weapons of war. Their earliest efforts, which lumbered onto Cyran battlefields in the late 930s YK, were barely more than golems with limited sentience, difficult to command in the field.

	"Successful as the warforged were, though, House Cannith never lost interest in building a better titan. Cyre didn't lose its desire for deadly weapons that could give it an edge over its enemies, and tremendous amounts of gold flowed from Cyre's coffers into the vaults of House Cannith as research and development continued, working toward a new kind of warforged that would bring an end to the war once and for all, and establish Cyre's martial supremacy for centuries to come.": "尽管战争锻造者取得了成功，但坎尼斯家族从未失去对制造更好的泰坦的兴趣。赛尔并没有失去对致命武器的渴望，这些武器可以让它在敌人面前获得优势，随着研究和开发的继续，大量的黄金从赛尔的国库流入坎尼斯家族的金库，致力于开发一种新的战争锻造者，以彻底结束战争，并在未来的几个世纪里确立赛尔的武术优势。",

	"The project succeeded beyond Cyre's wildest dreams.

	"A warforged colossus is part warforged and part vehicle. It stands between 200 and 300 feet tall. For optimal performance, a colossus required an active crew including a captain with the Mark of Making, a weapons officer with the Mark of Storm, and a helmsman with the Mark of Passage. When absolutely necessary, though, the colossus could direct itself but at diminished power. A colossus also carried a sizable contingent of elite troops, who could ride in safety within the colossus while it crushed through enemy lines or smashed through a wall, then pour out through hatches once the colossus was in position.": "战神巨像是部分战神和部分车辆。它的高度在200到300英尺之间。为了获得最佳性能，巨像需要一个活跃的船员，包括一个拥有制造印记的船长，一个拥有风暴印记的武器官，以及一个拥有穿越印记的舵手。不过，在绝对必要的时候，巨像可以自己指挥，但力量会有所减弱。巨像还可以携带相当数量的精锐部队，他们可以在巨像内安全地骑行，而巨像则碾压敌人的防线或击穿墙壁，然后在巨像就位后从舱门中涌出。",
	"The power source of a colossus is a Khyber dragonshard of unusually large size, cut into a specific pattern that allows the dragonshard to contain raw magical energy without exploding.

	"Warforged colossi were physically powerful, but their principal weaponry involved the use of bound elementals. Some expelled blasts of elemental fire from their hands or mouths; others wielded adamantine swords they could wreathe in flame. Some colossi also used bound elementals for defense: manifesting shields of elemental rock, blasting out elemental air to deflect ranged attacks, and so on. The captain of the colossus could control all this weaponry through the {@item docent|ERLW} network, but for optimal performance the captain relied on a weapons officer with the Mark of Storm to employ this elemental weaponry.": "战神巨兽的身体很强大，但他们的主要武器涉及到使用绑定的元素。有些人从手中或口中喷出元素之火；另一些人则挥舞着金刚剑，可以在火焰中环绕。有些巨像还使用绑定的元素进行防御：显现出元素岩石的盾牌，喷射出元素空气来抵御远程攻击，等等。巨像的舰长可以通过{@item docent|ERLW}网络控制所有这些武器装备，但为了获得最佳性能，舰长要依靠一个拥有风暴标志的武器官来使用这些元素武器。",
	"When adventurers discover a colossus, it might be in any state. Some have fallen or collapsed and become overgrown with vegetation to the point where one could be mistaken for a small hill. One was engulfed when the rock under its feet turned to liquid and swallowed it up, encasing it in a stone prison when the rock hardened. Some are buried—except for the head, perhaps, or a hand, which serves as a clear indicator that something lies underneath.": "当冒险者发现一座巨石时，它可能处于任何状态。有的已经倒下或坍塌，变得杂草丛生，以至于有的可以被误认为是一座小山。有一个被吞没了，因为它脚下的岩石变成了液体，把它吞没了，当岩石变硬时把它包裹在一个石牢里。有些被埋葬了--除了头部，也许，或者一只手，作为一个明确的指标，表明下面有东西。",

But entering the remains of a warforged colossus is not a task to be taken lightly, since the Mournland can have bizarre effects on the colossus's {@item docent|ERLW} network, power core, and weaponry, as well as its mind.": "一个巨像通常有多个舱口可以进出：在腿上，在背上，在胸口，在嘴里或在脑后，等等。但是，进入战神巨像的遗体并不是一件轻而易举的事，因为哀伤之地会对巨像的{@item docent|ERLW}网络、动力核心和武器装备以及它的思想产生奇怪的影响。",
	"What arose as an order of militant knights within the nation of Karrnath fell into disgrace and became a shattered remnant. The Order of the Emerald Claw now operates as a collection of cells of fanatical warriors, necromancers, and spies. On the surface, its members seem to be driven by Karrnathi patriotism, and they purport to be adherents of the Blood of Vol. The most cursory investigation reveals that claim to be a facade.": "作为卡尔纳斯国家的一个激进骑士团，它陷入了耻辱，成为一个破碎的残余。翡翠之爪骑士团现在是一个由狂热的战士、死灵法师和间谍组成的小组。从表面上看，其成员似乎是受卡尔纳特爱国主义的驱使，他们声称是沃尔之血的信徒，但最粗略的调查显示，这种说法是假的。",
	"During the Last War, Karrnath was forced to embrace the practice of necromancy to bolster the ranks of its army. At the same time, a number of chivalric orders were founded by devoted worshipers of the Blood of Vol. These groups included necromancers and bone knights that were trained to raise and command the undead troops used during the war. The Order of the Emerald Claw was one of the most infamous of these groups, renowned for its fighting skills but often sanctioned for its brutal treatment of enemy soldiers. The Emerald Claw were also accused of slaughtering civilians so they could be raised as skeletons or zombies—behavior that was strictly forbidden by the Karrnath commanders.": "在最后的战争中，卡尔纳特被迫接受死灵法术，以加强其军队的力量。同时，一些骑士团由沃尔之血的忠实崇拜者成立，这些团体包括死灵法师和骨骑士，他们被训练成在战争中养育和指挥亡灵部队。翡翠之爪骑士团是这些团体中最臭名昭著的一个，以其战斗技巧而闻名，但常常因其残酷对待敌方士兵而受到制裁。翡翠之爪还被指控屠杀平民，以便将他们培养成骷髅或僵尸--这种行为是被卡尔纳特指挥官严格禁止的。",
	"When King Kaius III came to power near the end of the war, he turned against the Blood of Vol. The orders were disbanded, and many members of the Emerald Claw were condemned as war criminals. While the other orders complied with the king's edict, many knights of the Emerald Claw refused to surrender. The order fragmented as its original members scattered, but a number of those rebellious knights started their own cells, rallying all who wanted to see Karrnath achieve its rightful glory. The order experienced a surge in membership following the Treaty of Thronehold because many Karrns thought that Kaius III had betrayed their nation by embracing peace.": "当战争接近尾声时，凯乌斯三世上台，他转而反对沃尔之血。骑士团被解散，翡翠之爪的许多成员被判处为战犯。虽然其他骑士团遵守了国王的命令，但许多翡翠之爪的骑士拒绝投降。骑士团因原有成员分散而四分五裂，但其中一些反叛的骑士成立了自己的小组，召集所有希望看到卡尔纳特实现其应有的荣耀的人。在《王权条约》之后，骑士团的成员数量激增，因为许多卡尔纳斯人认为凯厄斯三世因拥护和平而背叛了他们的国家。",
	"Six years ago, shortly after Kaius's accession, a figure known as {@creature Lady Illmarrow|ERLW} emerged as the leader of the Order of the Emerald Claw. Few of her followers know anything about her, other than her great skill as a necromancer; many members of the Order refer to her as Queen of the Dead. Some members of the order believe she will ultimately raise Karrnath above all other nations. Others simply trust that she will grant them personal power. They believe that she is poised to become a god of death, and that when she ascends to divinity, they will be granted immortality or at least the eternal life of undeath.": "六年前，在凯厄斯登基后不久，一个被称为{@creature Lady Illmarrow|ERLW}的人物作为翡翠之爪骑士团的领袖出现了。除了她作为死灵法师的伟大技能之外，她的追随者很少有人知道她的情况；许多骑士团的成员称她为死灵女王。骑士团的一些成员相信她最终会使卡尔纳特超越所有其他国家。其他人只是相信她会赋予他们个人力量。他们相信她已经准备好成为死亡之神，当她升为神时，他们将被授予不朽之身，或者至少是不死之身的永生。",

They might have to protect a village from a necromancer who is sucking the life out of the land, or race through a dungeon to acquire a necromantic relic before the Claw can claim it. The Emerald Claw is ideally suited to pulp action; it's a force that is blatant in its villainy and has hordes of evil minions to do its bidding. Defeating the schemes of the Emerald Claw should always feel like the right thing to do.": "在低等级时，冒险者可以与翡翠之爪的骷髅和僵尸发生冲突。随着人物能力的增强，威胁也随之升级。他们可能要保护一个村庄不受正在吸食土地生命的死灵法师的影响，或者在爪子夺取一个死灵遗物之前，在地牢中赛跑，以获得它。翡翠之爪非常适合于纸浆行动；它是一种公然的恶棍力量，有成群的邪恶爪牙为其效劳。打败绿宝石之爪的阴谋总是让人觉得是正确的事情。",

	"The Material Plane is enfolded by thirteen planes of existence. Many of these have aspects of both Outer Planes and Inner Planes. All of them overlap with Eberron in some way, and they influence and are influenced by the Material Plane. The intensity of this influence waxes and wanes; scholars often depict the planes as orbiting Eberron—sometimes coming close, other times far away—though this manner of expression is merely a metaphor for their shifting influence. When another plane's influence on the Material Plane is especially strong, the plane is said to be coterminous. When its influence is weak, a plane is remote. The state of a plane can be important for performing epic rituals, creating of eldritch machines, or interacting with extraplanar entities. Whether or not a plane is remote or coterminous at a given time depends entirely on the needs of your story.": "物质界被13个存在的平面所包围着。其中许多都有外部世界和内部世界的一面。它们都以某种方式与Eberron重叠，并影响着物质界，也被物质界影响着。这种影响的强度忽高忽低；学者们经常把这些位面描绘成绕着Eberron运行--有时很近，有时很远--尽管这种表达方式只是对其影响变化的一种隐喻。当另一个位面对物质界的影响特别大时，这个位面就被称为 \"同位素\"。当它的影响很弱时，一个平面是遥远的。一个位面的状态对于进行史诗般的仪式、创造长生机或与星外实体互动来说可能很重要。一个平面在某一特定时间是否是遥远的或同源的，完全取决于你的故事需要。",
	"At certain places in the Material Plane, the barriers between worlds are thin, and some characteristics of another plane can bleed through into the material world. These places are called manifest zones, and the nature of each one is strongly shaped by the plane it connects to. The city of Sharn is located in a manifest zone linked to Syrania that keeps its towers reaching toward the sky and aids flight. Ghosts might linger in a manifest zone associated with Dolurrh, while a manifest zone tied to Lamannia might have wild vegetation and enhance druidic magic. A manifest zone might include a portal that allows free passage from either plane to the other. The descriptions of other planes in this section offer some other possible effects. Most manifest zones have reliable, persistent effects. Some have only weak connections to their planes, and their properties influence the world only when the plane is coterminous.": "在物质界的某些地方，世界之间的壁垒很薄，另一界的一些特性可以渗入物质界。这些地方被称为显化区，每个显化区的性质都被它所连接的位面所强烈塑造。沙恩城位于一个与西拉尼亚相连的显化区，它的塔楼一直伸向天空，有助于飞行。鬼魂可能会在与Dolurrh相关的显化区徘徊，而与Lamannia相关的显化区可能会有野生植被并增强德鲁伊的魔法。一个显灵区可能包括一个传送门，允许从任何一个位面自由通行到另一个位面。本节中对其他位面的描述提供了一些其他可能的效果。大多数显灵区都有可靠、持久的效果。有些则与它们的位面只有微弱的联系，它们的属性只有在位面相通时才会影响世界。",

	"Tens of thousands of years ago, the quori fought a bitter war with the giants of Xen'drik. The giants ended the war by severing the connection between Dal Quor and Eberron and disrupting the cycle of the planes. As a result, Dal Quor is always remote in relation to the Material Plane, and no manifest zones are tied to Dal Quor. The only way to reach Dal Quor from the Material Plane is through the psychic projection of dreaming, and the quori are forced to possess mortal hosts to work their will on Eberron.": "数万年前，库里人与Xen'drik的巨人进行了一场激烈的战争。巨人通过切断达尔-库尔和艾伯伦之间的联系，扰乱了各位面的循环，从而结束了这场战争。因此，达尔-库尔相对于物质世界来说总是很遥远，没有任何显化区与达尔-库尔相联系。从物质世界到达达尔-库尔的唯一途径是通过梦境的精神投射，而库里则被迫拥有凡人的宿主来实现他们在伊贝隆的意志。",
	"When a mortal soul dies, it is drawn to Dolurrh, a place defined by despair and apathy. Over time, memories are leached out of these trapped spirits until only husks remain. Although this seems a bleak fate, most religions maintain that Dolurrh isn't the end of a soul's journey; it is a gateway to whatever lies beyond. They assert that what appears to be dissolution is the natural process of the soul moving to a higher plane of existence that mortals can never realize: joining with the Sovereigns, merging with the Silver Flame, or simply rejoining the cycle of life in a new form. That claim notwithstanding, Dolurrh is a gloomy plane filled with the lingering traces of the dead.": "当一个凡人的灵魂死亡时，它被吸引到Dolurrh，一个由绝望和冷漠定义的地方。随着时间的推移，这些被困的灵魂的记忆被浸出，直到只剩下躯壳。虽然这似乎是一个暗淡的命运，但大多数宗教坚持认为，Dolurrh并不是一个灵魂旅程的终点；它是通向其他地方的大门。他们断言，看似解体的东西是灵魂走向凡人永远无法实现的更高存在层面的自然过程：与主宰者结合，与银色火焰融合，或者只是以新的形式重新加入生命的循环。尽管有这样的说法，多鲁尔是一个阴暗的位面，充满了死者的残余痕迹。",

	"Spells that summon elementals are empowered here. Such a spell of 1st level or higher cast within the zone is treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.": "召唤元素的法术在这里得到了授权。在该区域内施展的这种1级或更高等级的法术会被视为比所消耗的法术槽高一级的施法。",
	"The forces of nature work to tear down anything built within the zone. Weather, vegetation, and a rapid rate of decay combine to quickly destroy structures built in the region and overgrow the ruins.": "自然界的力量会拆毁任何建在该地区的东西。天气、植被和快速的腐烂速度结合在一起，迅速摧毁了在该地区建造的结构，并使废墟过度生长。",
	"The zone is dominated by towering trees and thick undergrowth. Animals come from the surrounding area to live in the zone, where they grow larger and stronger than usual for their species.": "该区以高耸的树木和茂密的灌木丛为主。动物们从周围地区来到这个区域生活，在这里它们长得比通常的物种要大要强。",
	"What appears to be a circle of stones is in truth a group of slumbering earth elementals that came from Lamannia during its most recent coterminous period.": "看起来是一圈石头，实际上是一群沉睡的土元素，它们在最近的同时期从拉曼尼亚来到这里。",
	"Mabar is the darkness that promises to swallow even the brightest day, the hungry shadow that yearns to consume light and life. It is the plane of entropy, hunger, and loss, slowly sucking the life from the multiverse. It is the source of negative energy in Eberron. Most undead are animated by the power of Mabar, and the life they drain from mortals flows into the Endless Night.": "马巴尔是有望吞噬最光明的一天的黑暗，是渴望吞噬光和生命的饥饿阴影。它是熵、饥饿和损失的平面，慢慢地从多元宇宙中吸走生命。它是Eberron中负能量的来源。大多数亡灵都被马巴尔的力量所激活，他们从凡人身上吸走的生命流入无尽之夜。",
	"Mabar is made up of many fragments, each one representing a different vision of desolation. The fiends of Mabar scheme to steal fragments of other planes and draw them down into their eternal darkness, creating a jumble of broken worlds in varying states of decay.": "玛巴尔是由许多碎片组成的，每个碎片都代表着不同的荒凉景象。玛巴尔的恶魔们计划偷取其他星球的碎片，并将它们卷入他们永恒的黑暗中，创造出一个处于不同腐烂状态的破碎世界的杂烩。",
	"Undead animated here have 2 extra hit points per Hit Die and make saving throws against being turned or {@condition frightened} with advantage.": "在这里被激活的亡灵，每个命中率都有2个额外的命中率，并且对被转化或{@condition frightened}有优势的拯救动作。",
	"Vegetation here is sour and stunted, animals are stillborn or deformed, and a malaise hangs in the air.": "这里的植物是酸的和发育不良的，动物是死胎或畸形的，空气中弥漫着一种萎靡的气息。",
	"On nights during the month of Sypheros, when the Shadow Moon is dominant in the sky, horrific monsters stalk the area, prompting residents to leave offerings outside their doors to ward off the evil.": "在西弗罗月的夜晚，当影子月亮在天空中占主导地位时，可怕的怪物会在该地区徘徊，促使居民在门外留下祭品以抵御邪恶。",
	"The radius of any light source in the zone is halved, and saving throws against necromancy spells are made with disadvantage in the zone.": "该区域内任何光源的半径都会减半，而且在该区域内对亡灵法术的蓄力攻击是不利的。",
	"The counterpoint to Fernia, Risia embodies winter's chill and the stoic constancy of the glacier. Across Risia's icy expanse, blizzards ceaselessly howl over floes of thick, blue ice, and frost giants carve great fortresses from glaciated mountains. Unprotected visitors perish quickly, but those who adapt to the cold or protect themselves from it can plumb the plane's frigid depths for ancient secrets.": "作为费尔尼亚的对立面，里西亚体现了冬天的寒意和冰川的坚韧不拔。在里西亚的冰天雪地里，暴风雪不停地在厚厚的蓝色浮冰上呼啸而过，冰霜巨人在冰川山上凿出巨大的堡垒。没有保护的游客很快就会死亡，但那些适应寒冷或保护自己的人可以在飞机的冰冷深处探寻古老的秘密。",
	"Spells that deal cold damage are empowered here. Such a spell of 1st level or higher cast within the zone deals cold damage as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.": "造成寒冷伤害的法术在此得到授权。在该区域内施展的这种1级或更高等级的法术会造成寒冷伤害，就像它的施法等级比所耗费的法术槽高一级一样。",
	"Veins of cobalt-blue ice run through a glacier in the area. If extracted, this ice maintains its temperature and doesn't melt. An object carved from it can function as a spellcasting focus for spells dealing with water or ice.": "钴蓝色的冰脉穿过该地区的一个冰川。如果被提取出来，这种冰可以保持其温度，不会融化。用它雕刻的物体可以作为与水或冰有关的法术的施法焦点。",
	"Abominable yetis lair in a network of bitterly cold, frost-rimed caves in the mountains.": "可憎的雪人的巢穴在山中的一个严寒的、带有霜冻的洞穴网络中。",
	"Any spell that deals fire damage deals just half the normal damage.": "任何造成火灾伤害的法术都只造成正常伤害的一半。",
	"Shavarath is the plane of war, ravaged by a conflict that will never end. Since the dawn of time, armies of fiends and celestials have fought one another in Shavarath, their eternal battles a microcosm of the struggle between good and evil that rages across all of reality. New arrivals are subject to forced conscription when encountered (whether by angel, demon, or devil), if they aren't summarily dispatched. Amid the constant strife, windstorms of blades scour the landscape, capable of cutting the unprepared to ribbons. For all its danger, Shavarath holds weapons of legend and a wealth of knowledge on the art of war.": "沙瓦拉斯是战争的平面，被一场永远不会结束的冲突蹂躏着。自时间之初，恶魔和天人的军队就在沙瓦拉斯互相厮杀，他们永恒的战斗是在整个现实中肆虐的善与恶之间斗争的缩影。新来的人在遇到（无论是天使、恶魔还是魔鬼）时，如果没有被立即遣散，就会被强制征召。在不断的纷争中，风卷残云，能把没有准备的人切成肉酱。虽然危险重重，但沙瓦拉特拥有传说中的武器和丰富的战争艺术知识。",
	"Blades crafted here have a reputation for being especially fine and sharp. When a creature in the zone scores a critical hit with an attack that deals piercing or slashing damage, the attack deals one additional die of damage.": "在这里制作的刀片以其特别精细和锋利而闻名。当该区域内的生物在造成穿刺或切割伤害的攻击中获得关键一击时，该攻击会造成一个额外的伤害。",
	"Blood spilled here never washes away. Any Charisma checks made in the zone to avoid hostility are made with disadvantage; Charisma checks made to encourage violence are always successful.": "洒在这里的血永远不会被洗掉。在这个区域内，任何为避免敌意而进行的魅力检查都是不利的；为鼓励暴力而进行的魅力检查则总是成功的。",
	"Storms of whirling blades cut the sky during times of combat, randomly attacking the participants. The effect is the same as that of the {@spell cloud of daggers} spell, but the area and the damage might both increase.": "在战斗时，旋转的刀片风暴会划破天空，随机攻击参与者。其效果与{@spell cloud of daggers}法术相同，但面积和伤害可能都会增加。",
	"Devils, demons, and angels duel in the remains of a ruined fortress that serves as a portal to Shavarath.": "魔鬼、恶魔和天使在一个废墟堡垒的遗迹中决斗，这个堡垒是通往沙瓦拉斯的门户。",
	"Crystal spires float in a perfect blue sky. Farms and serene communities stretch across clouds. Syrania is the plane of peace and all that flourishes in times of peace. This includes commerce; the Immeasurable Market of Syrania draws merchants and travelers from across reality.": "水晶尖顶漂浮在完美的蓝天上。农场和宁静的社区在云端延伸。西拉尼亚是和平的平面，所有的东西都在和平时期蓬勃发展。这包括商业；西拉尼亚的无量市场吸引了来自整个现实的商人和旅行者。",
	"Syrania is home to a host of angels that devote their immortal lives to serene contemplation. Each angel seeks to achieve mastery of one pure concept, such as holding all the knowledge on a subject or ceaselessly abiding by the tenets of a virtue. An angel of dreams isn't a quori, but it understands dreams, it can explain and interpret them, and it can shape them if it chooses. Likewise, an angel of war isn't constantly embroiled in battle as the celestials of Shavarath are; instead, it seeks perfection in the art and theories of war. Angels of Syrania can be useful sources of information for adventurers, and sometimes travel to Eberron to observe mortals.": "西拉尼亚是一群天使的家，他们将自己不朽的生命献给了宁静的沉思。每位天使都寻求掌握一个纯粹的概念，例如掌握一个主题的所有知识，或不断地遵守一种美德的信条。梦境天使不是夸父，但它了解梦境，它可以解释和诠释它们，如果它选择的话，它可以塑造它们。同样地，战争天使并不像沙瓦拉斯的天人那样不断卷入战斗；相反，它在战争的艺术和理论方面寻求完美。西拉尼亚的天使可以成为冒险家们有用的信息来源，有时也会到艾伯伦去观察凡人。",
	"This zone suppresses all aggressive thought. Any creature that wants to make an attack or cast a damaging spell must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or it doesn't make the attack or cast the spell, but loses its action.": "这个区域抑制了所有的攻击性思维。任何想要进行攻击或施放破坏性法术的生物都必须在DC13智慧救赎中获得成功，否则它不会进行攻击或施放法术，但会失去其行动。",

	"A village is built into the side of a cliff face here. Windmills protruding from the cliff collect energy from the power of the wind, which is used to operate elevators throughout the community.": "这里的一个村庄建在悬崖峭壁的一侧。突出在悬崖上的风车从风的力量中收集能量，用于操作整个社区的电梯。",
	"Thelanis is the home of the fey and a realm where narrative and metaphor shape the nature of reality. Its many dominions are governed by the archfey, and the denizens of each realm reflect the nature and the story of their lord. For instance, the realm of the Prince of Frost is trapped in endless winter, and pale eladrin lead packs of winter wolves in their hunts. It's not the same environment as on Risia, because the prince's realm isn't an embodiment of the idea of cold—rather, it's a domain frozen by its prince's broken heart. If the prince's story were changed, the realm would change with it.": "Thelanis是精灵的故乡，也是一个由叙事和隐喻塑造现实本质的领域。它的许多领地都由大帝管辖，每个领地的居民都反映了他们的领主的性质和故事。例如，冰霜王子的王国被困在无尽的冬天里，苍白的艾拉德林带领成群的冬狼进行狩猎。这和里西亚的环境不一样，因为王子的王国并不是寒冷理念的化身--相反，它是一个被王子破碎的心冻结的领域。如果王子的故事被改变，这个领域也会随之改变。",
	"Time and space are both malleable in the Faerie Court, and a mortal who wanders into Thelanis might never return—or might leave after a few days to discover that weeks, months, or years have passed back home.": "时间和空间在精灵王庭都是可塑的，一个误入Thelanis的凡人可能再也回不来了，或者在几天后离开时发现家乡已经过了几周、几个月或几年。",
	"A circle of mushrooms serves as a portal to Thelanis when the proper offering is placed in its center.": "当适当的祭品放置在中心时，一圈蘑菇可以作为通往Thelanis的入口。",
	"The magic of the fey runs deep here. Saving throws against enchantment and illusion spells are made with disadvantage.": "精灵的魔法在这里流传甚广。对魔法和幻觉法术的蓄力攻击是不利的。",
	"Xoriat's bizarre geometry and unspeakable inhabitants seem like the product of an insane person's nightmare. In this utterly alien environment, beings whose appearance can shatter a person's sanity live in cities crafted from gargantuan, fleshy tumors. Seas of protoplasm, in a shade of purple that hurts the eyes, lap against shores of chitin. Some can look upon Xoriat and see it as a place of revelations, but most mortals who come too close to Xoriat fall prey to madness. Xoriat is the source of many aberrations, including the terrifying daelkyr.": "Xoriat诡异的几何形状和难以言喻的居民似乎是一个疯子的噩梦的产物。在这个完全陌生的环境中，那些外表可以粉碎一个人的理智的生物生活在由巨大的、肉质的肿瘤组成的城市中。紫色的原生质体的海洋，伤害了眼睛，拍打着壳质的海岸。有些人可以看到Xoriat，并将其视为一个启示的地方，但大多数凡人如果太接近Xoriat，就会陷入疯狂。Xoriat是许多反常现象的来源，包括可怕的daelkyr。",
	"Reality is frayed here. Casting any spell of 1st level or higher triggers a roll on the {@table Wild Magic Surge|PHB} table in chapter 3 of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}.": "现实在这里被磨灭了。施放任何1级或以上的法术，都会触发在《{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}》第3章的{@table Wild Magic Surge|PHB}表上的滚动。",

	"A cavern here is a cancerous tumor that issues forth aberrations to prey upon the world, and it is growing.": "这里的洞穴是一个癌瘤，它发出畸形的东西来掠夺世界，而且还在不断增长。",
	"It is theoretically possible to travel between Eberron and other worlds in the multiverse by means of the Deep Ethereal or various spells designed for planar travel, but the cosmology of Eberron is specifically designed to prevent such travel, to keep the world hidden away from the meddling of gods, celestials, and fiends from beyond.": "理论上来说，通过深空或各种专为平面旅行设计的法术，在埃伯龙和多元宇宙中的其他世界之间旅行是可能的，但埃伯龙的宇宙学是专门为防止这种旅行而设计的，以使这个世界远离神、天人和恶魔的干预。",
	"The three progenitor wyrms worked together to form Eberron and its planes as a new cosmic system in the depths of the Ethereal Plane. They recreated the elves, orcs, dragons, and other races found throughout the multiverse and placed them in their new world, but allowed them to develop beyond the reach of Gruumsh, Corellon, Lolth, and other influences for good and ill.": "三位始祖巫妖一起工作，在虚空界的深处形成了Eberron和它的平面，作为一个新的宇宙系统。他们重新创造了精灵、兽人、龙和其他在多元宇宙中发现的种族，并将他们安置在他们的新世界中，但允许他们在格鲁姆什、科雷隆、洛尔思和其他善恶影响的范围之外发展。",
	"In your campaign, you might decide that the barrier formed by the Ring of Siberys is intact, and contact between Eberron and the worlds and planes beyond its cosmology is impossible. This is the default assumption of this book. On the other hand, you might want to incorporate elements from other realms. Perhaps you want to use a published adventure that involves Tiamat or the forces of the Abyss meddling in the affairs of the world. In such a case, it could be that the protection offered by the Ring of Siberys has begun to fail. You might link the weakening of Siberys to the Mourning—perhaps whatever magical catastrophe caused the Mourning also disrupted the Ring of Siberys, or perhaps a disruption of the Ring of Siberys actually caused the Mourning!": "在你的战役中，你可能会决定由西伯利亚之环形成的屏障是完整的，Eberron和其宇宙观之外的世界和位面之间的联系是不可能的。这是本书的默认假设。另一方面，你可能想加入其他领域的元素。也许你想使用一个已发表的涉及提亚马特或深渊力量插手世界事务的冒险。在这种情况下，可能是西伯利亚之环提供的保护已经开始失效。你可以将Siberys的衰弱与哀伤联系起来--也许造成哀伤的魔法灾难也扰乱了Siberys之环，或者也许Siberys之环的扰乱实际上造成了哀伤！\"。",
	"If contact between Eberron and the wider multiverse is recent and limited, consider the implications for everyone involved. In the Great Wheel, Asmodeus is an ancient threat, with well-established cults, lines of tieflings, and a long history of meddling that sages might uncover in dusty old tomes hidden in remote libraries. But if Asmodeus has only just discovered Eberron and begun to influence it for the first time, there is no lore about him to be discovered on Eberron. He has no power base and needs to recruit new followers. Unusual alliances might form against him, as celestials and fiends join forces to expel this hostile outsider.": "如果Eberron和更广泛的多元宇宙之间的接触是最近的和有限的，请考虑对每个人的影响。在大轮回中，阿斯莫德是一个古老的威胁，他有完善的邪教，有铁皮人的血统，还有很长的干涉历史，贤者们可能会在藏在偏远图书馆的尘封的旧书中发现。但如果阿斯莫德刚刚发现埃伯龙并开始第一次影响它，那么在埃伯龙上就没有关于他的传说可以发现。他没有权力基础，需要招募新的追随者。不寻常的联盟可能会形成来反对他，因为天人和魔族会联合起来驱逐这个敌对的外来者。",
	"The people of Eberron believe their gods are omnipresent—not bound to a single coherent form, but present in all places. If you revere the Silver Flame, its power is always with you. The Sovereign Onatar guides the hand of every smith who knows how to listen for his voice, and Dol Arrah and Dol Dorn are active on every battlefield, guiding every soldier. This outlook means that religion is driven by faith, as opposed to the concrete actions of deities. The faithful believe that their triumphs reflect the assistance of a divine influence. They don't expect a god to physically show up and solve their problems.": "Eberron的人们相信他们的神是无所不在的--不受限于单一的连贯形式，而是存在于所有地方。如果你崇敬银色火焰，它的力量就会一直伴随着你。主宰者奥纳塔引导着每一个知道如何倾听他声音的铁匠的手，多尔-阿拉和多尔-多恩活跃在每一个战场上，指导着每一个士兵。这种观点意味着宗教是由信仰驱动的，而不是由神灵的具体行动驱动的。信徒们相信，他们的胜利反映了神的影响的帮助。他们并不期望神明会亲自出现并解决他们的问题。",
	"Fiends and celestials certainly do have physical form, however. Fortunately for the folk of the Material Plane, these extraplanar creatures are deeply invested in their own affairs and have little interest in Eberron. Demons and angels battle one another in Shavarath, but they've been doing this since before humanity existed, and they dare not leave their posts to fool around elsewhere. Exceptions do exist, such as the daelkyr and the Dreaming Dark, but by and large these natives of other planes are exclusively concerned with where they live. As such, player characters are more likely to encounter celestials and fiends that are native to Eberron, spawned by Khyber or Siberys, rather than extraplanar entities.": "然而，恶魔和天人当然也有身体形态。对物质世界的人们来说，幸运的是，这些星外生物对他们自己的事情投入很大，对Eberron兴趣不大。恶魔和天使在沙瓦拉斯互相争斗，但他们在人类存在之前就已经开始这样做了，他们不敢离开自己的岗位去其他地方胡闹。例外的情况确实存在，例如daelkyr和Dreaming Dark，但总的来说，这些其他星球的土著只关心他们生活的地方。因此，玩家角色更有可能遇到Eberron本土的天人和魔物，它们是由Khyber或Siberys催生的，而不是星外实体。",
	"Couatls are a celestial race born from Siberys at the dawn of time. Along with the dragons, they battled the fiendish overlords of Khorvaire and Sarlona. Ultimately, the couatls sacrificed most of their number and combined their souls to form a prison to hold the overlords. Scholars have theorized that their combined souls eventually became the force that is worshiped by the Church of the Silver Flame. The church is ambivalent on the topic, preaching that regardless of how the Flame was first kindled, there is a place within the Flame for all noble souls.": "Couatls是一个在时间之初从Siberys诞生的天体种族。他们与龙一起，与霍尔韦尔和萨洛纳的恶魔霸主作战。最终，库阿特人牺牲了他们中的大部分人，并将他们的灵魂结合在一起，形成了一个关押霸主的监狱。学者们推测，他们结合的灵魂最终成为银焰教会所崇拜的力量。教会在这个问题上是矛盾的，宣扬无论火焰最初是如何被点燃的，在火焰中都有一个位置给所有高贵的灵魂。",
	"The few couatls that remain on Eberron are devoted servants of the light. They are most often found guarding the prison of the ancient fiendish overlords, and individuals sometimes act directly to aid adventurers who fight the forces of darkness.": "留在艾伯伦的少数库拉特斯是光明的忠实仆人。他们最常被发现守卫在古代恶魔霸主的监狱里，个别的人有时会直接帮助那些与黑暗势力作斗争的冒险者。",
	"The mightiest of the fiends born from Khyber are creatures of immense power known as the overlords. Dozens of overlords were imprisoned by the Silver Flame at the dawn of time; two of them, {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} and {@creature Sul Khatesh|ERLW}, are detailed in {@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}. Another—Bel Shalor, the Shadow in the Flame—is bound within the Silver Flame itself in the great cathedral in Flamekeep in Thrane. You can adapt other evil gods or archfiends for an Eberron campaign (assuming you don't want Eberron to be connected to the wider multiverse) by recasting them as overlords. For example, Tiamat could be an overlord embodying the pride and potential for evil within dragons, Lolth could be an overlord who preys on the elves, and Asmodeus the insidious maker of profane bargains.": "从开伯尔诞生的最强大的恶魔是具有巨大力量的生物，被称为霸主。在时间之初，数十位霸主被银色火焰所囚禁；其中两个，{@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW}和{@creature Sul Khatesh|ERLW}，详见{@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}。另一个--贝尔-沙洛，火焰中的影子--被束缚在银色火焰本身中，位于瑟兰的火焰镇大教堂中。你可以为Eberron战役改编其他邪神或大恶魔（假设你不希望Eberron与更广泛的多元宇宙相联系），把他们改编为霸主。例如，提亚马特（Tiamat）可以是一个体现龙的骄傲和潜在邪恶的霸主，洛尔思（Lolth）可以是一个掠夺精灵的霸主，而阿斯摩德（Asmodeus）则是阴险的亵渎交易的制造者。",
	"Any fiend—whether devil, demon, yugoloth, or something else—could be spawned by Khyber if it suits your story. Such fiends might be bound to an overlord, or they might be independent incarnations of evil unleashed on the world. Two other races of fiends, though, play important roles in its history.": "如果适合你的故事，任何恶魔--无论是魔鬼、恶魔、Yugoloth还是其他东西--都可以由开伯尔催生出来。这样的恶魔可能被束缚在一个霸主的身边，也可能是独立的邪恶化身，被释放到这个世界上。不过，另外两个魔族在其历史上扮演着重要角色。",
	"Night hags have been around since the Age of Demons, when they often served as ambassadors and carried messages between the fiends and the dragons. Today, they remain impartial mediators, and adventurers who are about to deal with outsiders or other planes of existence might want to seek the advice of a night hag—although one can be quite difficult to find.": "夜魔女从恶魔时代就开始存在了，当时她们经常充当大使，在恶魔和龙之间传递信息。今天，她们仍然是公正的调解人，那些即将与外来者或其他存在的星球打交道的冒险者可能想寻求夜行者的建议--尽管她们可能很难找到。",
	"As the primary agents of the fiendish overlords, rakshasas once dominated Khorvaire and Sarlona. When the overlords were defeated in the first age of the world by the combined might of the dragons and the couatls, the rakshasas largely disappeared into Khyber as well. The Lords of Dust are made up largely of rakshasas, scheming in the shadows—many trying to free their imprisoned overlords, others looking for a way to claim their masters' power for their own.": "作为恶魔霸主的主要代理人，拉克萨人曾经主宰了霍尔韦尔和萨洛纳。当霸主在世界的第一个时代被龙和库拉特斯的联合力量击败后，拉克萨斯也基本消失在开伯尔。尘土领主主要由罗刹人组成，他们在暗中策划--许多人试图释放他们被囚禁的霸主，其他人则在寻找一种方法，将他们主人的权力据为己有。",
	"Thanks to the industrious innovation of multiple dragonmarked houses and workshops full of magewrights, the people of Khorvaire can cross the continent in a week or less using magical means. The lightning rail and vessels powered by bound elementals and operated by the dragonmarked houses, can carry passengers as far in an hour as a horse can walk in a day. This section discusses issues related to travel in an Eberron campaign and presents the Gold Dragon Inns, a chain of hotels that offer consistent accommodation for travelers anywhere in Khorvaire.": "由于多个龙纹屋和充满魔力的工场的勤奋创新，霍尔韦尔的人们可以在一周之内用魔法手段穿越大陆。由绑定的元素驱动并由龙纹屋操作的闪电轨道和船只，可以在一小时内载运乘客，就像马在一天内行走一样远。本节讨论了与Eberron战役中的旅行有关的问题，并介绍了金龙旅馆，一个为Khorvaire的任何地方的旅行者提供稳定住宿的连锁酒店。",
	"As described in {@book chapter 5|DMG|5} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, it's up to you whether you gloss over travel in your campaign or narrate it in more detail. If the point is to get the characters to their destination so they can get the adventure underway, it's fine to assume that their journey (whether it's by lightning rail, airship, or more mundane means) passes without incident. After all, the people of Khorvaire make such trips every day, and most of them reach their destinations safely.": "正如{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中所描述的那样，在你的活动中是掩盖旅行，还是更详细地叙述它，这取决于你。如果重点是让人物到达目的地，以便他们能够开始冒险，那么假设他们的旅程（无论是通过闪电般的铁路、飞艇，还是更平凡的手段）顺利通过就可以了。毕竟，Khorvaire的人们每天都在进行这样的旅行，而且他们中的大多数人都能安全到达目的地。",
	"The alternative is to make the journey an important part of the adventure. Travel can play a crucial role in a story, and when it does, you should give it as much time at the game table as it needs.": "另一个办法是让旅行成为冒险的重要部分。旅行可以在故事中发挥关键作用，当它发生时，你应该在游戏桌上给它尽可能多的时间。",
	"Long ago, gnome artificers and specialists from House Cannith discovered and developed a means of magical travel. The heart of the process is a set of techniques for binding elementals that uses Khyber dragonshards. This closely guarded procedure requires delicate engineering, arcane skill, and rare materials from around the world, and different workshops employ varying esoteric techniques. Building a new vehicle can occupy a workshop for months while magical energy is painstakingly inlaid into the vessel's hull. Such work is a complicated task requiring the labor of many; it is not something that can be undertaken by a lone wizard for any amount of compensation.": "很久以前，坎尼斯家族的地精工匠和专家发现并开发了一种神奇的旅行方式。这个过程的核心是一套使用开伯尔龙石的元素绑定技术。这个被严密保护的程序需要精致的工程、奥术技能和来自世界各地的稀有材料，不同的工场采用不同的深奥技术。建造一辆新车可能会占用一个车间几个月的时间，而魔法能量会被不遗余力地镶嵌在船体上。这样的工作是一项复杂的任务，需要许多人的劳动；这不是一个孤独的巫师可以承担的，没有任何报酬。",
	"The construction of elemental vessels requires the use of two kinds of dragonshards. A Khyber dragonshard of the largest size and finest quality is required to bind the elemental to the vessel, and a Siberys dragonshard is needed to craft the vehicle's helm. Production of new vessels grinds to a halt without a steady supply of both kinds of dragonshards, and a workshop with an order to fill will pay a handsome fee to adventurers who can find them.": "建造元素船需要使用两种龙石。一块最大尺寸和最优质的凯博尔龙石需要用来将元素束缚在船上，而西伯利亚龙石则需要用来制作船只的头盔。如果没有这两种龙碎片的稳定供应，新船只的生产就会停滞不前，有订单的工场会向能找到它们的冒险者支付一笔丰厚的费用。",
	"Every elemental vessel is imbued with an {@condition invisible}, arcane matrix. This magical essence extends from the containment chamber at the core of the vehicle to the binding struts, then through the rest of the vehicle's hull. When a Khyber dragonshard holding a bound elemental is placed in the containment chamber, the matrix comes alive. The unsuppressed elemental emerges from the shard and flows along the matrix in the way that blood moves through the arteries and veins of a living creature.": "每个元素容器都被注入了一个{@condition invisible}，奥术矩阵。这种魔法精华从车辆核心的容纳室延伸到束缚支柱，然后穿过车体的其他部分。当持有束缚元素的开伯尔龙碎片被放置在容纳室中时，矩阵就会活跃起来。未受压制的元素从碎片中出现，并沿着矩阵流动，就像血液在生物的动脉和静脉中流动一样。",
	"The binding struts force the elemental into a ring shape and give every elemental vessel its distinctive appearance. From there, the elemental continues to flow along the matrix through the hull, appearing as jagged, snaking lines of living energy that pulse and shift. These conduits of elemental energy take on an appearance associated with the type of elemental bound into the vessel. A fire elemental, for example, sends tendrils of flame along the hull of its ship.": "捆绑的支柱迫使元素形成一个环形，并使每个元素容器具有独特的外观。从那里，元素继续沿着基体流经船体，表现为锯齿状的、有生命力的能量线，并有脉冲和变化。这些元素能量的管道呈现出与绑定在容器中的元素类型相关的外观。例如，火元素会沿着其船体发出火焰卷轴。",
	"At the command of the vehicle's dragonmarked pilot, the bound elemental can be suppressed, causing its essence to flow back into the containment chamber and the matrix to disappear from view. A vehicle whose elemental is suppressed ceases to be propelled.": "在车辆的龙纹驾驶员的指挥下，被束缚的元素可以被压制，使其精华流回封闭室，矩阵从视野中消失。元素被压制的车辆将不再被推动。",
	"Piloting an elemental vessel requires effective communication between the pilot and the bound elemental. The elemental controls the vehicle's movement, and everything from basic propulsion to delicate maneuvering is dependent on the ability of the pilot to control the elemental. If the elemental is uncontrolled and not suppressed, the vehicle moves according to the elemental's whim until a pilot asserts control again.": "驾驶元素船需要飞行员和被约束的元素之间的有效沟通。元素控制着车辆的运动，从基本的推进力到微妙的操纵都取决于飞行员控制元素的能力。如果元素不受控制，也没有被压制，那么车辆就会按照元素的意愿移动，直到飞行员再次主张控制。",
	"A dragonmarked heir at the helm of a vessel can command the elemental easily. Without such a pilot, it's very difficult to control the vessel. A character who is touching either the Khyber dragonshard where the bound elemental is housed or the magic item at the vessel's helm can try to communicate with the elemental, but with no guarantee of success.": "掌舵船只的龙纹继承人可以轻松指挥元素。没有这样的驾驶员，就很难控制船只。一个角色如果接触到放置绑定元素的凯博龙石或船只舵手的魔法物品，可以尝试与元素沟通，但不能保证成功。",
	"The {@spell dominate monster} spell can also enable a character without a dragonmark to control an elemental vessel, even wresting control away from a dragonmarked pilot. The {@spell charm monster|XGE} spell (found in {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}) also makes the elemental compliant to the caster's wishes, but the elemental remains obedient to the commands of a dragonmarked pilot at the helm.": "{@spell dominate monster}法术也可以使没有龙纹的角色控制元素船，甚至从有龙纹的驾驶员手中夺取控制权。{@spell charm monster|XGE}法术（见{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}）也能使元素船顺从施法者的意愿，但元素船仍然听从掌舵的龙纹驾驶员的命令。",
	"The airship is the most advanced elemental-powered vehicle on Eberron, the pride of House Lyrandar and the forerunner of the magical advances that many hope will become commonplace in the aftermath of the Last War. The first airships emerged from the Cannith and Zilargo workshops and appeared in House Lyrandar's service just eight years ago (in 990 YK). For now, though, they remain rare, because the soarwood required for their construction is exceedingly scarce and tightly controlled.": "飞艇是Eberron上最先进的元素动力交通工具，是Lyrandar家族的骄傲，也是许多人希望在最后一次战争之后变得普遍的魔法进步的先行者。第一艘飞艇出现在坎尼斯和齐拉尔戈的工场，并在八年前（990 YK）出现在利兰达尔家族的服务中。不过现在，它们仍然很罕见，因为建造它们所需的翱翔木非常稀少，而且受到严格控制。",
	"Soarwood is a form of buoyant timber found only on the island of Aerenal, and the elves who live there limit their annual harvest of the precious wood. As a result, production of new airships proceeds at a snail's pace, unable to satisfy the fervent demand for new vessels. The discovery of a new supply of soarwood could literally change the world, and even convincing the elves of Aerenal to part with more of it would be an achievement worth a handsome reward from House Lyrandar.": "翱翔木是一种只有在Aerenal岛上才能找到的浮力木材，而生活在那里的精灵们每年都会限制对这种珍贵木材的收获。因此，新飞艇的生产以蜗牛的速度进行，无法满足人们对新船的狂热需求。发现新的翱翔木供应可以改变世界，甚至说服Aerenal的精灵们放弃更多的翱翔木也是一项值得Lyrandar家族给予丰厚奖励的成就。",
	"A standard airship (at least as far as standards have been defined for this relatively new creation) looks similar to an oceangoing ship but is rigged with control fins and rudders rather than sails. An air or fire elemental is bound into a ring around the hull, which is suspended on four struts jutting outward. Most airships are outfitted with the finest amenities, including many decorative flourishes and creature comforts.": "一艘标准的飞艇（至少就这种相对较新的创造物所定义的标准而言）看起来类似于一艘远洋船，但装有控制鳍和舵，而不是风帆。一个空气或火元素被束缚在船体周围的一个环中，船体被悬挂在四个向外突出的支柱上。大多数飞艇都配备了最好的设施，包括许多装饰性的装饰品和生物舒适度。",
	"Only a dragonmark heir with the Mark of Storm can use the wheel and command the bound elemental. House Lyrandar pilots train for months to gain a deep understanding of the ship's powers and limitations. Because of this training, a skilled pilot can execute acrobatic maneuvers in the sky.": "只有拥有风暴印记的龙印继承人才能使用轮子并指挥被束缚的元素。Lyrandar家族的飞行员经过几个月的训练，对飞船的能力和限制有了深刻的了解。因为这种训练，一个熟练的飞行员可以在天空中执行杂技动作。",
	"Airships can move in all three dimensions, with or without the aid of the wind. Unlike most flying creatures, they don't rely on wings for lift thanks to their soarwood hulls. They are able to fly equally well on their sides or even upside down (notwithstanding the risks that such maneuvers present to passengers and crew).": "飞艇可以在所有三个维度上移动，无论是否有风的帮助。与大多数飞行生物不同的是，由于它们的翱翔木船体，它们不依靠翅膀来获得升力。它们同样能够侧身飞行，甚至倒立飞行（尽管这种操作对乘客和船员有风险）。",
	"Airships cannot actually land, because the struts that hold the elemental ring in place protrude 10 feet from the bottom of the vessel. Thus, passengers and cargo are lifted in elevators and loaded at towers in major cities. Each ship carries rope ladders for use at smaller stations, in open terrain, or in cases of dire emergency.": "飞艇实际上不能降落，因为固定元素环的支柱从船底伸出10英尺。因此，乘客和货物用电梯提升，并在主要城市的塔楼上装载。每艘船都携带绳梯，以便在较小的站点、开阔的地形或在严重的紧急情况下使用。",
	"A typical airship can reach a speed of 20 miles per hour in clear skies carrying up to 30 tons of cargo. Airships are most often employed by explorers and by wealthy travelers who demand luxury—clients who have a need to move quickly to places that might not be served by the lightning rail.": "一艘典型的飞艇在晴朗的天空中可以达到每小时20英里的速度，携带多达30吨的货物。飞艇最常被探险家和要求豪华的富裕旅行者所雇用--他们有需要快速移动到可能没有闪电般的铁路服务的地方。",
	"Although the elemental bound to the airship is essential for propulsion, the vessel's soarwood hull provides its lighter-than-air buoyancy. When the elemental is suppressed, the ship remains aloft but can't move. The pilot always suppresses the elemental before docking, then uses ropes to maneuver the vessel into position.": "虽然绑定在飞艇上的元素对推进力至关重要，但飞艇的翱翔木船体提供了比空气更轻的浮力。当元素被压制时，飞船仍在高空但不能移动。飞行员总是在停靠前压制住元素，然后用绳索将船只操纵到位置。",
	"A House Lyrandar galleon, also called an elemental galleon, resembles a Lyrandar airship except that it has a water elemental ring that propels it across oceans and seas instead of through the air. This vessel has a speed of 10 miles per hour but otherwise is similar to a Lyrandar airship.": "Lyrandar家族的大帆船，也被称为元素大帆船，与Lyrandar飞艇相似，只是它有一个水元素环，推动它穿越海洋，而不是通过空气。这种船的速度为每小时10英里，但其他方面与Lyrandar飞艇相似。",
	"The wondrous lightning rail system once linked the far reaches of the Kingdom of Galifar, prior to the Last War. Now the system is divided, split into eastern and western circuits. Reestablishing the {@i conductor stone} paths across Scions Sound and the Mournland is often discussed in the halls of power in the Five Nations, but formidable challenges are involved.": "在最后一次战争之前，奇妙的闪电铁路系统曾经连接着加利法尔王国的远方。现在这个系统被分割开来，分成了东部和西部的线路。在五国的权力大厅里，人们经常讨论重建横跨塞恩斯湾和哀牢地的{@i conductor stone}路径，但这涉及到艰巨的挑战。",
	"The elemental vessel at the front of the train, called a crew cart, holds a bound air elemental that propels the train along its route at a speed of about 30 miles per hour. The elemental appears as a ring of lightning encircling the crew cart while the train is in motion. A bound air elemental can move a train of up to ten carts without obvious strain, and most trains are configured accordingly.": "列车前部的元素容器，称为乘务车，持有一个绑定的空气元素，推动列车以每小时约30英里的速度行驶。在火车行驶过程中，空气元素以闪电环的形式出现，包围着乘务车。一个绑定的空气元素可以在没有明显压力的情况下移动多达十辆车的火车，而且大多数火车都是这样配置的。",
	"The other carts that make up the train have various purposes. A typical train has a crew cart at each end, with two cargo carts, four passenger carts, and two lounge carts in between. Doors at both ends of each cart enable crew and passengers to walk from one to the next, even while the train is in motion. Both crew carts are identical, except that the bound elemental in one is suppressed. On the return trip, the roles of the carts and the states of their elementals are reversed.": "组成列车的其他小车有不同的用途。一辆典型的火车在两端各有一辆乘务车，中间有两辆货运车、四辆客运车和两辆休息车。每个车的两端都有门，使乘务员和乘客能够从一个车走到另一个车，甚至在列车行驶中也是如此。两辆乘务车都是一样的，只是其中一辆车的绑定元素被压制了。在回程中，小车的角色和它们的元素的状态是相反的。",
	"Specialized carts of other sorts vary in configuration depending on their purpose and the degree of luxury afforded to them. Some have solid sides and roofs, while others are covered only with canvas.": "其他种类的专用车在配置上也有不同，这取决于它们的用途和对它们的豪华程度。有些有坚固的侧面和屋顶，而有些则只用帆布覆盖。",
	"Map 4.10 shows the different carts that comprise most lightning rail trains.": "地图4.10显示了组成大多数闪电铁路列车的不同车种。",
	"The vessel's pilot, a House Orien dragonmarked heir, stands at the helm, high atop the crew cart, beneath the elemental binding struts. The pilot controls the elemental and communicates with it during the trip, watching the path ahead through broad windows that encircle the helm platform.": "这艘船的驾驶员，一位奥瑞恩家族的龙纹继承人，站在舵手的位置上，高高在上的船员车，在元素束缚的支柱下面。驾驶员控制着元素，并在旅途中与它交流，通过环绕舵手平台的宽大窗户观察前方的道路。",
	"The crew of a train includes handful of chief stewards overseeing a number of lesser stewards who are charged with seeing to the needs of passengers and keeping cargo secured.": "火车上的乘务员包括几名首席乘务员，他们负责监督一些较小的乘务员，以满足乘客的需要并保证货物的安全。",
	"Lightning rail stations, where passengers and cargo can be disembarked or loaded, are located in or just outside villages, towns, and cities along the conductor stone paths. There are no stations in the expanses between these settlements, and House Orien rules prohibit lightning rail pilots from stopping anywhere but at a station.": "可供乘客和货物下船或装货的闪电铁路站，位于村庄、城镇和城市沿线的指挥石道内或外。在这些定居点之间的广袤地带没有车站，奥瑞恩家族的规则禁止闪电铁路飞行员在车站以外的任何地方停留。",
	"Individual stations do have distinct touches that reflect local features. For example, the station in Gatherhold, in the Talenta Plains, is decorated with traditional halfling motifs and offers specialized stables for travelers leaving their dinosaurs behind. On a larger scale, the station at Passage, which is the seat of power for House Orien, is a multistoried structure designed as a monument to the majesty and storied history of the house.": "个别车站确实有反映当地特色的独特触觉。例如，位于塔伦塔平原的加瑟霍德（Gatherhold）车站，以传统的半身人图案为装饰，并为离开恐龙的旅行者提供专门的马厩。在更大的范围内，帕萨奇的车站是奥瑞恩家族的权力所在地，它是一个多层的结构，被设计成一个纪念碑，以纪念该家族的威严和传奇的历史。",
	"Lightning rails and airships are good places to encounter a broad sample of Khorvaire's diverse population. You can use the Mysterious Passengers table to bring curious characters in contact with an adventuring party on any kind of journey. Each of these characters might spark an entire new adventure, or might be little more than a momentary diversion. Determine details about these travelers are, and the stories behind them, as you see fit.": "闪电轨道和飞艇是很好的地方，可以广泛地接触到霍尔韦尔的不同人口样本。你可以使用 \"神秘乘客 \"表，让好奇的角色在任何类型的旅行中与冒险队伍接触。这些人物中的每一个都可能引发整个新的冒险，也可能只是一个短暂的转移而已。你可以决定这些旅行者的细节，以及他们背后的故事，只要你认为合适。",

In its mean streets, gritty detectives contend with corrupt law officers while trying to foil the efforts of merciless gangs and monstrous thugs. In the highest towers, wealthy barons from the dragonmarked houses make shady deals with crime bosses, each of them making profits by exploiting both the ordinary folk and the well-heeled upper crust alike. Corruption can be found among the ranks of government, the watch, the temples, and large businesses.

	"Sharn can also be a place of unrelenting action, ranging from soarsleds speeding between the towertops to confrontations in the dungeon depths far beneath the city's lowest tier. Fallen angels, sinister shapeshifters, and monstrous mercenaries do battle with heroes from all walks of life, while unscrupulous collectors and smugglers carry on a brisk trade in artifacts brought back from the cyclopean ruins of Xen'drik. All these factors make Sharn an equally ideal location for adventures inspired by pulp action.": "沙恩也可以是一个充满无情行动的地方，从塔顶之间的飙车到城市最底层的地牢深处的对峙。堕落的天使、阴险的变形金刚和畸形的雇佣兵与来自各行各业的英雄进行战斗，而无良的收藏家和走私者则在从Xen'drik的环形废墟带回的文物上进行着活跃的交易。所有这些因素使沙恩成为一个同样理想的冒险地点，其灵感来自纸浆行动。",

If the players enjoy this creative exercise, you could also allow each player to add a physical detail to the place or to describe one of the location's NPCs—the stuffed gorgon head over the hearth, another regular among the customers, and so on. This is a way to make this location truly feel like home, and to give each player a personal investment in it. This location becomes an automatic starting point for adventures, the place where the adventurers will meet with patrons and conduct business.": "与玩家合作，发展每个角色与该地点的联系。例如，如果该地点是一个酒馆，一个吟游诗人角色可能每周有两个晚上在那里表演。一个战士可能是一个常客，他的饮料以他的名字命名。一个游侠可以是当地飞镖联盟的不败冠军。如果玩家喜欢这种创造性的练习，你还可以让每个玩家为这个地方添加一个物理细节，或者描述这个地方的一个NPC--壁炉上的毛绒高竿头，顾客中的另一个常客，等等。这是一种使这个地点真正有家的感觉的方法，并使每个玩家对它有个人投资。这个地方自动成为冒险的起点，是冒险家们与顾客见面和开展业务的地方。",

Each table is meant to be used on a different level of Sharn: the lower wards, middle wards, upper wards, and Skyway. You can choose results from the tables, or randomly determine what happens, and you can modify results as you please, tailoring the details of an event to be a better fit for a particular district. The events on the tables are phrased so they can be read aloud or summarized to players.": "以\"{@book Lower Sharn Street Events|ERLW|11|Lower Sharn Street Events} \"开头的街道事件表充满了人物在沙恩周围游荡时可以看到的随机事件。你可以对一个条目进行扩展，使其成为一个遭遇或冒险的开始，尽管不是每个事件都需要把人物引向一个较长的故事。每个表格都是为了在沙恩的不同层面上使用：下层区、中层区、上层区和天路。你可以从表格中选择结果，也可以随机决定发生什么，你可以随心所欲地修改结果，将事件的细节调整为更适合于某个特定地区。表格上的事件是有措辞的，因此可以大声朗读或总结给玩家听。",
	"After the adventurers witness an event on the streets of Sharn, what happens next depends largely on what they do. Maybe they avert their eyes and keep walking, as many residents of Sharn have trained themselves to do. Maybe they rush to get involved, or poke around delicately to learn more.

The rowdy Brelish veterans who call themselves the Brokenbridge Brawlers don't think of themselves as criminals, and they have no connection to any larger organization.": "在沙恩，犯罪是日常生活的一部分，就像在其他城市一样，有时这种行为是由与有组织犯罪没有关系的人实施的。一个正直的公民可能被激情所驱使而去杀人。一个难民可能会因为绝望而成为一个砍刀手。那些自称 \"布罗肯布里奇斗士\"（Brokenbridge Brawlers）的布雷利什老兵们不认为自己是罪犯，他们与任何大型组织都没有联系。",
	"Any professional criminal in Sharn, however, is likely to be affiliated with one of four organizations. The Boromar Clan is the most entrenched and widespread of the four, and has dominated the business of crime in Sharn for centuries. The group called Daask is on the rise, directly challenging the Boromars. The Tyrants and House Tarkanan are smaller organizations with more specialized areas of operation. These groups are summarized in the Criminal Organizations of Sharn table and described in the later sections that follow.": "然而，在沙恩，任何职业罪犯都可能隶属于四个组织之一。波罗玛家族是四个组织中最根深蒂固和最广泛的，几个世纪以来一直主宰着沙恩的犯罪事业。被称为达斯克（Daask）的组织正在崛起，直接挑战波洛玛家族。暴君（Tyrants）和塔卡南（House Tarkanan）是规模较小的组织，有更专业的运作领域。这些组织在 \"沙恩的犯罪组织 \"表中进行了总结，并在后面的章节中进行了描述。",
	"Each of these organizations has a core of operatives and enterprises under the direct control of its leaders. But each also has a network of secondary relationships.": "这些组织中的每一个都有一个由其领导人直接控制的核心人员和企业。但每个组织也有一个次要的关系网络。",
	"For example, the Little Fingers are a group of pickpockets and cutpurses that work in the Bazaar of Middle Dura. They aren't directly tied to the Boromar family. But the master of the gang pays a tithe to the Boromars, and if the Boromars send word to them that certain targets are to be avoided, the Little Fingers do so. In return, the Boromars ensure that the Sharn Watch in Middle Dura largely leaves the Fingers alone. So although the Boromar Clan itself has a few hundred members, it has interaction with thousands of criminals throughout the city.": "例如，\"小手指 \"是一群在中杜拉的集市上工作的扒手和小偷。他们与波洛玛家族没有直接联系。但是，该团伙的主人向波洛玛家族支付什一税，如果波洛玛家族向他们传话说要避开某些目标，小手指就会这样做。作为回报，Boromars家族确保中杜拉的沙恩守望者基本上不干涉小手指。因此，尽管波罗马氏族本身只有几百名成员，但它与整个城市的数千名罪犯有互动。",
	"{@book Chapter 3|ERLW|8} provides an overview of the four major criminal organizations and a body of information about them that's more or less common knowledge in Sharn. This section explores the roles that each one could play in a Sharn-based campaign.": "{@book Chapter 3|ERLW|8}提供了四个主要犯罪组织的概况，以及关于他们的信息，这些信息在沙恩或多或少都是常识。本节探讨了每个组织在基于沙恩的战役中可能发挥的作用。",
	"Although the powerful organizations in Sharn have a hand in most criminal activity, sometimes you might want an adventure to involve a smaller gang. The Street Gangs table presents a number of lesser criminal groups adventurers could tangle with.": "虽然沙恩的强大组织在大多数犯罪活动中都有参与，但有时你可能希望冒险涉及一个较小的团伙。街头帮派表列出了一些较小的犯罪集团，冒险者可以与之纠缠。",
	"From the owners of incense-clouded dens to fast-talking street dealers, many entrepreneurs—legitimate and otherwise—make a profitable business selling narcotics in Sharn. The following drugs are just two of the most notorious substances available in the City of Towers and beyond.": "从香火旺盛的窝点老板到快人快语的街头商贩，许多企业家--不管是合法的还是其他的--都在沙恩以销售麻醉品为生，从中获利。以下毒品只是塔城和其他地方最臭名昭著的两种物质。",
	"The Boromar Clan": "波洛玛氏族",

	"Cyran veterans who present themselves as a vigilante militia that protects Cyran refugees, but some say they're just pursuing selfish interests": "居里安退伍军人，以保护居里安难民的民兵自居，但有人说他们只是在追求自私的利益",

	"The most powerful criminal organization in Sharn started as a family of halfling immigrants from the Talenta Plains. Operating out of its headquarters and key holdings in the Little Plains district of Middle Menthis, the Boromar Clan controls gambling, smuggling, and theft in Sharn. Most of the city's burglars, pickpockets, and fences either work for or pay tithes to the organization. The Boromar Clan's network of extortion, bribery, and blackmail extends from Lower Dura to Skyway.": "沙恩最强大的犯罪组织始于一个来自塔伦塔平原的半身人移民家庭。波洛玛家族以其总部和位于中门提斯小平原区的主要财产为据点，控制着沙恩的赌博、走私和盗窃。城市中的大多数窃贼、扒手和销赃者要么为该组织工作，要么向其支付什一税。波洛马氏族的勒索、贿赂和敲诈网络从下杜拉延伸到天路。",
	"The Boromars' influence extends beyond criminal enterprises into many legitimate circles of power. Ilyra Boromar sits on the city council, and a number of other councilors are close allies of the clan. The family has ties by marriage to House Jorasco. A Boromar attends every Skyway party. The family owns tenements throughout Sharn and invests in shipping, storing both legal goods and contraband in many of the warehouses in Precarious and Cogsgate. In many districts, local officials and Sharn Watch officers have been taking bribes from the Boromars for generations.": "波洛玛家族的影响力超出了犯罪企业的范围，延伸到许多合法的权力圈。伊里拉-波罗马是市议会的成员，其他一些议员也是该家族的亲密盟友。该家族与乔拉斯科家族有联姻关系。每一个天威派对都有一个博罗玛人参加。该家族在整个沙恩拥有房产，并投资于航运业，将合法货物和违禁品都储存在普雷森斯和科格斯门的许多仓库中。在许多地区，地方官员和沙恩守望官员世代都在接受波洛玛家族的贿赂。",
	"The criminal nature of the Boromar Clan is an open secret, and in some districts the Boromars are seen as hometown heroes. They are immigrants who've made good, common people who've risen to rival the barons and kings. They give the people what they want, whether it's untaxed gambling, cheap spirits, or dreamlily. The clan operates with a degree of impunity because its operatives adhere to an unspoken rule: whenever possible, criminal acts against individuals should target tourists and travelers. Boromar pickpockets don't prey on the people they see every day. Instead, they seek out the many strangers who move around the city all the time. The Watch officer who turns a blind eye to a pickpocket thus feels justified, since it's not the citizens of Sharn that are victimized.": "波洛马氏族的犯罪性质是一个公开的秘密，在一些地区，波洛马氏族被视为家乡的英雄。他们是做好事的移民，是上升到与男爵和国王匹敌的普通人。他们给人们提供他们想要的东西，无论是不征税的赌博、廉价的烈酒，还是梦幻般的。该部族的活动在一定程度上不受惩罚，因为它的特工人员遵守一个潜规则：只要有可能，针对个人的犯罪行为应该针对游客和旅行者。Boromar扒手并不以他们每天看到的人为目标。相反，他们寻找的是那些一直在城市里活动的许多陌生人。因此，对扒手视而不见的观察官觉得自己有理，因为受害的不是沙恩的市民。",
	"Boromar's longstanding status at the head of Sharn's criminal enterprises has recently come under challenge. After nearly a decade of slow growth, the Droaamish mob known as Daask has recently started targeting Boromar holdings. The halfling clan hasn't faced such a serious threat before, and it's scrambling to figure out how to deal with Daask's guerrilla tactics.": "Boromar长期以来在沙恩犯罪企业中的领导地位最近受到了挑战。经过近十年的缓慢增长，被称为Daask的Droaamish暴徒最近开始瞄准Boromar的财产。半身人氏族以前从未面临过如此严重的威胁，它正争先恐后地想办法对付达斯克的游击战术。",
	"The Boromar Clan has a hand in all types of crime in Sharn. Most Boromar leaders despise unnecessary violence, but the clan has a host of enforcers and a handful of capable assassins. The clan's web of extortion is so thoroughly woven into society that many residents simply consider it another form of tax. Boromar specializes in three fields of activity: gambling, smuggling, and thievery.": "波洛马氏族与沙恩的各种犯罪行为都有牵连。大多数Boromar家族的领导人鄙视不必要的暴力，但该家族有许多执法者和少数有能力的刺客。该部族的勒索网是如此彻底地交织在社会中，以至于许多居民仅仅认为这是另一种形式的税收。博罗玛擅长三个领域的活动：赌博、走私和偷窃。",
	"Gambling isn't illegal in Sharn, but all legal games are taxed by the Brelish crown and are required to follow regulations that spoil the experience for many. Boromar's operations are cheaper to participate in and offer the lure of greater profits.": "赌博在沙恩并不违法，但所有合法的游戏都由布雷利什王室征税，并需要遵守相关规定，这让很多人的体验大打折扣。Boromar的业务参与起来比较便宜，并提供更大的利润诱惑。",
	"Smuggling has become an increasingly important business since the Last War disrupted many traditional lines of trade. The clan's primary import is the narcotic called dreamlily. But the Boromars traffic in a wide range of goods, from arcane and alchemical weapons to foreign luxury items that have been made scarce by embargoes and sanctions. Under Boranel's law, it's forbidden to sell Aundairian wine in Breland, so if you want the good stuff, you'll need to work with the Boromars.": "自从上次战争扰乱了许多传统的贸易路线后，走私已成为一项日益重要的业务。该部族的主要进口产品是一种被称为梦百合的麻醉品。但博罗玛人贩运的货物范围很广，从奥术和炼金武器到因禁运和制裁而变得稀缺的外国奢侈品。根据Boranel的法律，禁止在Breland销售Aundairian葡萄酒，所以如果你想要好东西，你需要和Boromars合作。",
	"Boromar-sanctioned acts of thievery include the activities of the ubiquitous pickpockets that can be found across the city as well as the well-planned jobs of professional burglars. As mentioned earlier, Boromar thieves focus their attention on visitors to Sharn, thus avoiding friction with local law enforcement. When appropriate, stolen goods are transported out of the city by the fences and porters that drive the clan's smuggling operations.": "Boromar认可的偷窃行为包括城市中无处不在的扒手的活动，以及职业窃贼的精心策划的工作。如前所述，波罗马盗贼的注意力集中在来到沙恩的游客身上，从而避免了与当地执法部门的摩擦。在适当的时候，赃物会由推动该部族走私活动的栅栏和搬运工运出城外。",
	"The Boromar Clan employs people of all races, but most of the organization and nearly all of its inner circle are made up of halflings. Some of the organization's most important people are these:": "Boromar氏族雇佣了所有种族的人，但该组织的大部分人和几乎所有的核心圈子都是由半身人组成的。该组织最重要的一些人是这样的。",

	"Councilor Ilyra Boromar is the eldest daughter of Mala and Saidan and a member of the city council. The Boromars' enemies on the council have grown bolder in the face of increased Daask attacks against the clan, and some of Ilyra's influence has eroded as a result.": "Ilyra Boromar议员是Mala和Saidan的长女，也是市议会的成员。面对达斯克对该部族越来越多的攻击，博罗玛家族在议会中的敌人变得越来越大胆，伊利亚拉的一些影响力也因此受到了削弱。",

	"Castar, a gnome, is the lone non-halfling in the Boromars' inner circle. He serves as Saidan's chief advisor and the organization's intelligence expert. The family looks to Castar to come up with a plan to defeat Daask, but so far none of his ideas have worked.": "卡斯塔尔，一个地精，是波罗马人内部圈子里唯一的非半身人。他是赛丹的首席顾问和该组织的情报专家。家族希望卡斯特能想出一个打败达斯克的计划，但到目前为止，他的想法都没有成功。",
	"The Boromars control gambling dens and nightclubs throughout Sharn. The finer establishments are places for the Boromar Clan to wine, dine, bribe, and extort the city's powerful elite. At the other end of the spectrum, the run-down gambling halls and dreamlily dens in the poorer districts are places where those in the employ of the Boromars plan heists, store smuggled goods, hide bodies and wanted criminals, interrogate Daask spies, make good on threats, and unwind.": "波罗玛家族控制着整个沙恩的赌博场所和夜总会。较好的场所是波洛玛家族喝酒、吃饭、贿赂和敲诈城市权贵的地方。在光谱的另一端，贫穷地区的破旧的赌博厅和梦幻般的舞厅是那些受雇于波罗马家族的人计划抢劫、储存走私货物、隐藏尸体和通缉犯、审讯达斯克间谍、兑现威胁和放松的地方。",
	"These places are public and expertly run by the city's most powerful criminals, so an openly violent approach to problem-solving in such a spot is likely to end in tragedy for the characters. When combat does occur in one of these nightclubs, it's usually because the instigators have brought enough strength of arms to take on the Boromars.": "这些地方是公共场所，由城市最强大的犯罪分子专业经营，所以在这样的地方公开以暴力方式解决问题，很可能会以人物的悲剧收场。当战斗确实发生在这些夜总会中时，通常是因为煽动者带来了足够的武器力量来对付波洛玛人。",
	"The nightclub shown on map 4.12 could be tied to the Boromar Clan, or it could be any Sharn nightclub you need it to be.

	"Formed by monstrous immigrants from Droaam, Daask has been building its power in the Khyber's Gate and Malleon's Gate districts of Sharn for the last decade. It is most infamous for its monstrous enforcers, but the organization also draws members from the destitute populace of Sharn—largely goblins and shifters, but also humans, dwarves, and any other humanoid who feels that the current system has failed them. Daask makes its money through acts of violence, from mugging to armed robbery to outright pillaging. The group has diversified in recent years, building an extortion racket—threatening violence if tribute isn't paid—and entering into the drug trade, selling both dreamlily and a mysterious substance called dragon's blood.": "Daask由来自Droaam的畸形移民组成，在过去的十年中一直在沙恩的Khyber's Gate和Malleon's Gate地区建立自己的势力。它最臭名昭著的是它的畸形执法者，但该组织也从沙恩的贫困人口中吸纳成员--主要是地精和变身者，但也包括人类、矮人，以及任何其他觉得现行制度让他们失望的类人。达斯克通过暴力行动赚钱，从抢劫到武装抢劫，再到彻底的掠夺。近年来，该组织已经多样化，建立了一个敲诈勒索团伙--如果不支付贡品就威胁使用暴力，并进入了毒品贸易，出售梦幻花和一种叫做龙血的神秘物质。",
	"From the outside, Daask appears to be interested solely in fomenting violence and chaos. The monstrous nature of its members reinforces this impression; most people consider the members of Daask to be savage beasts. The truth is more complicated. The Droaamites who make up the core of Daask aren't merely criminals; they are elite soldiers of Droaam working for Sora Katra, and part of an operation that is taking root in larger cities across Khorvaire. The seemingly random attacks by Daask are part of a larger plan that, if it succeeds, will eventually give Sora Katra a foothold in the heart of Khorvaire.": "从外面看，达斯克似乎只对煽动暴力和混乱感兴趣。其成员的怪异性质强化了这种印象；大多数人认为达斯克的成员是野蛮的野兽。事实要复杂得多。组成Daask核心的卓尔人不仅仅是罪犯；他们是卓尔的精英士兵，为索拉-卡特拉工作，是在整个霍尔韦尔较大城市扎根的行动的一部分。达斯克看似随意的攻击是一个更大的计划的一部分，如果它成功了，最终将使索拉-卡特拉在霍尔韦尔的中心地带有一个立足点。",
	"Over the last two years, the Daask cell in Sharn has been waging a slowly escalating war against the holdings of the Boromar Clan. The Boromars were surprised by the violence of these attacks and have suffered significant losses. Daask prefers guerrilla tactics, using only as many combatants as necessary to get a job done, never staying in one place too long, and quickly retreating back to their turf. Though the Boromars still control much of criminal activity in the middle and upper parts of Sharn, Daask is gaining ground in the lower level of the city and controls crime in the Cogs.": "在过去的两年里，沙恩的达斯克细胞一直在对波洛玛尔部族的持有地发动缓慢升级的战争。波罗玛人对这些攻击的暴力感到惊讶，并遭受了重大损失。达斯克更倾向于采用游击战术，只使用必要的战斗人员来完成任务，从不在一个地方停留太久，并迅速退回到他们的地盘。虽然波罗马人仍然控制着沙恩中上层的大部分犯罪活动，但达斯克在城市下层的地位越来越高，并控制着科格区的犯罪。",
	"Violence and intimidation are Daask's most used tools. Rather than using bribery, Daask manipulates the Sharn Watch through displays of force and brutal reprisals against officers who dare to stand in the way. Coupled with the fact that Daask primarily targets businesses with ties to the Boromars, this means that many of the Watch officers of the lower wards will step aside and allow a Daask raid to run its course.": "暴力和恐吓是达斯克最常用的工具。达斯克不使用贿赂，而是通过展示武力和对敢于阻挠的官员进行残酷的报复来操纵沙恩守望。再加上达斯克的目标主要是与波洛玛人有联系的企业，这意味着许多下层区的守望官员会靠边站，让达斯克的突袭行动顺利进行。",
	"As Daask has seized territory from the Boromar Clan, it has also begun taking over a few of the clan's traditional businesses. In addition to dreamlily, Daask sells a highly addictive drug called dragon's blood.": "随着Daask从Boromar部族手中夺取领土，它也开始接管该部族的一些传统业务。除了梦兰，达斯克还销售一种叫做龙血的高成瘾性药物。",
	"Daask has another, perhaps surprising area of operation: religion. The organization has brought priests of the Dark Six to Sharn and has restored a ruined temple to the Dark Six in Khyber's Gate. Followers of the Dark Six have few other opportunities to practice their faith, and providing this new facility for them has made many allies for Daask across the city.": "达斯克还有一个也许令人惊讶的行动领域：宗教。该组织将黑暗六神的牧师带到了沙恩，并在开伯尔之门修复了一座破败的黑暗六神庙。黑暗六神的追随者很少有其他机会来实践他们的信仰，而为他们提供这个新的设施使达斯克在整个城市中结成了许多盟友。",
	"Daask's lower ranks are made up of goblinoids, humans, shifters, and other humanoids recruited from the population of Sharn. The Droaamish soldiers that make up the core of the organization include changelings, gnolls, harpies, ogres, minotaurs, medusas, trolls, and other monstrous beings. Basilisks, cockatrices, death dogs, displacer beasts, and similar monsters are kept by Daask, though these creatures are usually used only within the Cogs.": "达斯克的下层人员由地精、人类、变种人和其他从沙恩人口中招募的人形生物组成。构成该组织核心的德罗阿米什（Droaamish）士兵包括变种人、地精、哈皮人、食人魔、牛头人、梅杜莎人、巨魔和其他畸形生物。Basilisks, cockatrices, death dogs, displacer beasts, 和类似的怪物由Daask饲养，尽管这些生物通常只在Cogs内部使用。",

	"Daask members congregate in safe houses that are hard to find and easy to defend or escape from. The most popular gathering location is a Cog hub. The dark, twisting halls of these underworld hot spots are familiar to Daask members and confusing to their enemies.

Daask also uses Cog hubs to stash bodies, drugs, or prisoners.": "达斯克成员聚集在安全屋中，这些安全屋很难找到，而且容易防守或逃离。最受欢迎的聚集地点是Cog中心。这些地下世界热点的黑暗、扭曲的大厅对达斯克成员来说是熟悉的，而对他们的敌人来说则是混乱的。科格中心的狭窄通道有很多堵塞点，迫使一对一的对抗，在这种情况下，达斯克的强大怪物往往具有优势。达斯克还利用 \"齿轮中心 \"来藏匿尸体、毒品或囚犯。",

Once the characters know a hub's location, they still must navigate the mazelike Cogs to find the place.": "试图在Cogs找到Daask中心本身就是一种冒险。大多数成员对他们的会面地点和藏身之处讳莫如深。一旦人物知道了一个中心的位置，他们仍然必须在迷宫般的Cogs中穿梭，以找到那个地方。",
	"The Cog hub shown in map 4.13 could be a Daask location, or it could be any Sharn underworld location you need it to be. Several crafted and natural labyrinthine passages no more than 10 feet wide lead to the main chamber. Many of these passages connect with stairs, ladders, and wells that lead higher or lower in the Cogs, in addition to small chambers that could be ambush points, temporary quarters for criminals or squatters, or places to lay a trap or place an alarm trigger.": "地图4.13中显示的Cog枢纽可以是Daask的位置，也可以是你需要的任何沙恩地下世界的位置。几个手工制作的和天然的迷宫式通道，宽度不超过10英尺，通往主室。这些通道中有许多与楼梯、梯子和水井相连，可以通往更高或更低的地方，此外还有一些小房间，可以作为伏击点、罪犯或寮房的临时住所，或者是布置陷阱或触发警报的地方。",
	"These passages converge into a single large chamber that can hold a large group for meetings and serve as a temporary safe house or a place to stash contraband. When criminals occupy the area, at least one guard is always on duty, and typically there is one guard at every entrance to the chamber.": "这些通道汇聚成一个大密室，可以容纳一大群人开会，也可以作为临时安全屋或藏匿违禁品的地方。当犯罪分子占据该区域时，至少有一名警卫一直在值班，通常在密室的每个入口都有一名警卫。",

	"On the surface, Daask appear to be nothing more complicated than a gang of violent monsters wreaking havoc in the worst parts of the city. If you want, this can be the only role they play in a campaign: a ready source of sudden violence. Low-level characters might work with the Sharn Watch or the Boromar Clan to curtail Daask muggings and raid dreamlily houses. This crusade against Daask will escalate as the adventurers become more powerful; Daask will unleash ever more powerful monsters, and its forces might start targeting the adventurer's allies and loved ones. Those attacks won't end until the adventurers delve deep into the Cogs and defeat Cavallah herself.": "从表面上看，达斯克似乎没有什么更复杂的东西，只是一帮暴力的怪物在城市最糟糕的地方肆意破坏。如果你愿意，这可能是他们在战役中扮演的唯一角色：一个随时可能发生的暴力源头。低级别的角色可能会与沙恩守望者或博洛玛氏族合作，遏制达斯克的抢劫行为，并突击检查梦幻之屋。这种对达斯克的讨伐会随着冒险者变得更加强大而升级；达斯克会释放出更加强大的怪物，它的力量可能开始针对冒险者的盟友和亲人。这些攻击不会结束，直到冒险家们深入到科加斯，打败卡瓦拉本人。",
	"Monsters are infiltrating our city! Though the Sharn Watch acts as though Daask is a problem only for Malleon's Gate, and not a threat to law-abiding citizens, there is clear cunning in the criminal cabal's actions.

Once these monsters control the city's crime, what will they do next?": "怪物们正在渗透到我们的城市中! 尽管沙恩守望者表现得好像达斯克只是马利翁之门的问题，而不是对守法公民的威胁，但犯罪集团的行动显然是狡猾的。他们最近的攻击目标是整个下层区的财产，都是某个半身人家族的，就好像达斯克试图暴力接管沙恩的地下世界一样。一旦这些怪物控制了城市的犯罪，他们接下来会做什么？",
	"Another option is to delve deeper into the motives of Daask, to explore the idea that these monsters aren't as savage as they appear. The elite members of Daask are spies, soldiers, and saboteurs using their criminal activities as a cover for their true agenda. What is Sora Katra really trying to accomplish in Sharn? This question ties to how you decide to use the Daughters of Sora Kell, described earlier in this chapter. Do the Daughters simply want to ravage their enemies? Or, guided by the oracular visions of Sora Teraza, are they actually working toward some greater good? For instance, Daask agents could break into the vaults and workshops of dragonmarked houses and discover secret projects forbidden by the Treaty of Thronehold. They could clash with spies of foreign powers in Sharn, or pursue ancient artifacts in the ruins below the city to keep them out of others' hands.": "另一个选择是深入研究Daask的动机，探讨这些怪物并不像他们看起来那么野蛮。达斯克的精英成员是间谍、士兵和破坏者，用他们的犯罪活动作为他们真正议程的掩护。索拉-卡特拉在沙恩真正想要实现的是什么？这个问题与你决定如何使用索拉-凯尔的女儿们有关，本章前面已经描述过。女儿们是否只是想蹂躏他们的敌人？或者，在索拉-泰拉扎的神谕指引下，她们实际上是在为一些更大的利益而努力？例如，达斯克的特工可以闯入有龙纹的房子的金库和车间，发现《王权条约》所禁止的秘密项目。他们可以与沙恩的外国势力的间谍发生冲突，或者在城市下面的废墟中追寻古代文物，不让它们落入他人之手。",
	"Dreamlily is relatively safe; dragon's blood is not. Its effects are intentionally unpredictable, and you can take this idea wherever you like. Could drinking dragon's blood cause someone to develop a dragonmark? Could it turn addicts into crazed, draconic creatures?

Neither the Boromar Clan or the dragonmarked houses have been able to learn anything important about dragon's blood.": "梦百合是相对安全的；龙血则不是。它的影响是故意不可预测的，你可以把这个想法带到你喜欢的地方。喝龙血会不会导致某人出现龙纹？它能不能把上瘾者变成疯狂的龙族生物？达斯克只是为了赚钱而出售它，还是该药物的引入是一个更宏大的计划的一部分？无论是博罗玛家族还是有龙纹的家族，都没能了解到关于龙血的任何重要信息。",

	"The smallest of the four criminal organizations described here, House Tarkanan has no interest in claiming territory or dominating the criminal underworld. The house takes neither side in the war between the Boromar Clan and Daask, and it will not assassinate high-ranking members of either organization. In other matters, it sells its services to all who have the gold to pay for them. House Tarkanan's top priority is using its wealth to protect, train, and care for people who have aberrant marks. The leaders of the house are pragmatists and soldiers, and they train their recruits to be warriors and thieves.": "塔卡南家族是这里描述的四个犯罪组织中最小的一个，它对争夺领土或支配黑社会犯罪没有兴趣。该组织在波洛玛家族和达斯克之间的战争中不站队，也不会刺杀任何一个组织的高级成员。在其他方面，它向所有有金币支付的人出售其服务。塔卡南家族的首要任务是利用其财富来保护、训练和照顾那些拥有反常标记的人。该家族的领导人是实用主义者和士兵，他们将新兵训练成战士和盗贼。",
	"Despite its name, House Tarkanan is not a dragonmarked house; it has taken the name to mock its enemies, and it doesn't have the recognition, power, or resources of a dragonmarked house. In fact, many members of House Tarkanan hate the dragonmarked houses for being prejudiced against their kind and fear that they will instigate a second purge of aberrant marks. Others are more idealistic, and see the growing power of the houses as a threat to all of the nations of Khorvaire.": "尽管它的名字，Tarkanan家族并不是一个龙纹家族；它取这个名字是为了嘲笑它的敌人，而且它没有龙纹家族的认可、权力或资源。事实上，Tarkanan家族的许多成员憎恨龙纹家族，因为他们对自己的同类有偏见，并担心他们会煽动第二次对反常的龙纹进行清洗。另一些人则更加理想化，他们认为龙印家族不断增长的力量对霍尔韦尔的所有国家都是一种威胁。",

	"What differentiates the assassins of House Tarkanan from those of House Phiarlan and Thuranni is their accessibility.

Conversely, anyone with enough gold can hire House Tarkanan's assassins, but they take jobs only within Sharn.": "塔卡南家族的刺客与皮亚伦家族和瑟兰尼家族的刺客不同之处在于他们的可及性。有龙纹的家族只把他们的服务卖给特定的有钱有势的客户，而且他们可以在霍尔韦尔的任何地方追求合同。相反，任何有足够金币的人都可以雇佣塔卡南家族的刺客，但他们只在沙恩境内接活。",

	"Members of the Tyrants have a loose definition of identity. The majority of the members are changelings. They often maintain multiple identities, and a particular identity might be shared among a group of changelings.

But when he goes off-duty in the evening and keeping up the identity is an easier task, the role might be taken over by a young recruit.": "暴君会的成员对身份有一个宽松的定义。大多数成员是变革者。他们经常保持着多重身份，一个特定的身份可能在一群变化者之间共享。一个实际上是暴君组织代理人的沙恩守望队队长，在早上可能是暴君组织内部成员的形象，因为他必须与各种各样的人交往。但当他晚上下班后，保持身份是一项比较容易的任务时，这个角色就可能由一个年轻的新兵接管。",

	"The primary theme of the Tyrants is mystery. In dealing with the Tyrants, there is always a question of what is real and what the true objective actually is. With the Tyrants, anything could be a long con, and both allies and enemies may not be who they appear to be.": "暴君》的主要主题是神秘。在与暴君打交道时，总是有一个问题，即什么是真实的，真正的目标到底是什么。对暴君来说，任何事情都可能是一个漫长的骗局，盟友和敌人都可能不是他们表面上的样子。",
	"The Tyrants have three objectives: acquiring gold, gathering secrets, and protecting the changelings of Sharn. In working the Tyrants into a campaign, the first question is which of these objectives will take precedence.

Or are they most concerned with helping other changelings, who are often with the objects of fear and suspicion?": "暴君们有三个目标：获取黄金、收集秘密和保护沙恩的变种人。在战役中使用暴君的时候，第一个问题是这些目标中的哪一个将被优先考虑。他们是否主要是行贿者，试图尽可能多地榨取利润？他们是否主要致力于收集秘密，并利用这些秘密来操纵他人？或者他们最关心的是帮助其他变化者，而这些变化者往往是与恐惧和猜疑的对象？",

	"The Tyrants could also have a long-term sinister agenda—something they've been working on for generations, which is only coming to fruition now. Do they want to replace the entire city council of Sharn, or are their aspirations even higher than that?

	"Roll on another organization's Adventure Hooks table; the Tyrants are secretly involved in the situation.": "在另一个组织的冒险钩子表上滚动；暴君们暗中参与了这一情况。",
	"A common viewpoint among the citizens of Sharn is that in the upper wards, the Sharn Watch works for the wealthy; in the middle wards, it works for the Boromar Clan; and in the lower wards, it doesn't work at all. This assessment is close enough to the truth. There's an important undercurrent in the situation, however. Although most officers of the Watch take bribes, that doesn't mean all of them don't care about their city and won't try to keep their communities safe; they do so because they see their benefactors as being an important part of the continued health of their community. For instance, those officers who take gold from the Boromar Clan believe that the Boromars help keep the city running and give the people what they want. But if some strangers in town break the law, they're just troublemakers who deserve to be run in.": "沙恩市民的一个普遍观点是，在上层区，沙恩守望为富人服务；在中层区，它为波罗马家族服务；而在下层区，它根本不工作。这种评估已经很接近事实了。然而，在这种情况下，有一股重要的暗流。虽然大多数守望先锋的官员都收受贿赂，但这并不意味着他们所有人都不关心自己的城市，不会努力维护社区的安全；他们这样做是因为他们认为他们的恩人是社区持续健康发展的重要组成部分。例如，那些从Boromar氏族那里拿金子的官员认为，Boromar氏族帮助维持城市的运行，给人们提供他们想要的东西。但是，如果城里的一些陌生人违反了法律，他们只是麻烦制造者，应该被撞死。",
	"As another example, the guards of the Dura Bazaar have an understanding with the gang of pickpockets known as the Little Fingers. As long as the thieves target only tourists and foreigners, the Watch will dismiss any charges brought against them. Why should an officer of the Sharn Watch care if some Aundarian with more gold than sense gets robbed? But if the Little Fingers pick on a local, they're asking for trouble. The relationship works both ways; the pickpockets are privy to things the Watch officers aren't, and they often warn the Watch about suspicious people or activities they witness.": "再比如，杜拉巴扎的守卫与被称为小指头的扒手团伙达成了共识。只要这些小偷只针对游客和外国人，守卫就会驳回对他们提出的任何指控。为什么沙恩观察站的官员要关心某个金币多于理智的昂达尔人是否被抢劫了？但是，如果小指头们找本地人的麻烦，他们就会自找麻烦。这种关系是双向的；扒手们知道一些守望官员不知道的事情，而且他们经常警告守望官员他们所看到的可疑人物或活动。",
	"Watch officers do exist who are entirely crooked and care nothing for the law. At the other extreme, some officers are entirely honorable and place the law above all else, and most of those are willing to risk their lives to save an innocent bystander from a rampaging Daask troll. But most members of the Watch are pragmatists who put the needs of their clients uppermost, the needs of the citizenry second, and generally don't take action against locals.": "确实存在着一些完全不择手段、对法律漠不关心的观察人员。在另一个极端，有些官员是完全光荣的，他们把法律置于一切之上，其中大多数人愿意冒着生命危险，从横冲直撞的达斯克巨魔手中拯救无辜的旁观者。但大多数守望者成员都是实用主义者，他们把客户的需求放在首位，把公民的需求放在第二位，一般不会对当地人采取行动。",
	"The upshot of all this is that the Watch's response to a crime can vary significantly depending on the nature of the crime and where it's committed. As a rule, when a crime is committed in Skyway, any of the upper or middle wards, Lower Central, Lower Tavick's Landing, or Precarious, members of the Watch arrive to intervene and investigate as soon as possible. In Cliffside, Lower Menthis, and Lower Northedge, the few Watch members in these locations address crimes in order of priority. In Lower Dura and the Cogs, the Watch's reponse is typically very slow.": "这一切的结果是，根据犯罪性质和犯罪地点的不同，守望先锋对犯罪的反应会有很大不同。通常，当犯罪发生在Skyway、任何一个上层或中层区、下层中央区、下层Tavick's Landing或Precarious时，守望先锋成员会尽快赶到现场进行干预和调查。在Cliffside、Lower Menthis和Lower Northedge，这些地方的少数守望者按照优先顺序处理犯罪。在下杜拉和科格斯，守望先锋的反应通常非常缓慢。",
	"The discussion above primarily concerns the rank and file of the Sharn Watch, the guards who walk the streets day in and day out and the officers who supervise them. The Watch also includes a few special divisions that could cross the paths of the adventurers.": "上面的讨论主要是关于沙恩守望的官兵，那些日复一日走在街上的卫兵和监督他们的军官。守夜人还包括一些可能与冒险者擦肩而过的特殊部门。",
	"{@b The Blackened Book} is an elite core of abjurers and diviners, charged with investigating and containing magical threats. These wizards are highly dedicated to their work and their city, and generally don't take bribes. It's up to the higher-ups, however, to decide what missions to assign to the Blackened Book; if there's a case that a noble doesn't want investigated, it probably won't be.": "{@b The Blackened Book}是一个精英核心的驱魔师和占卜师，负责调查和遏制魔法威胁。这些巫师对他们的工作和他们的城市高度敬业，而且一般不接受贿赂。不过，要由上级来决定分配给黑化书的任务；如果有一个贵族不希望调查的案件，可能就不会被调查。",
	"{@b The Guardians of the Gate} came into being during the Last War to monitor the activities of foreign nationals and immigrants. Their duties have expanded since the surge of refugees into Sharn following the Mourning, and the Guardians of the Gate closely supervise the district of High Walls. The Guardians are chosen from among the best soldiers of the Watch and are devoted to their city. Many of them, however, place the safety of the city ahead of strict adherence to the law, and complaints are raised against them from time to time for unnecessary violence against refugees.": "{@b The Guardians of the Gate}是在最后一次战争期间成立的，目的是监督外国国民和移民的活动。他们的职责在哀悼之后难民涌入沙恩之后有所扩大，大门的守护者密切监督着高墙区的情况。守护者是从守望先锋的优秀士兵中挑选出来的，他们对自己的城市充满热情。然而，他们中的许多人将城市的安全置于严格遵守法律之上，并不时对他们对难民的不必要的暴力提出投诉。",
	"{@b The Redcloak Battalion} is an exceptional unit of soldiers that is called upon if a situation calls for extreme military force. The Redcloaks are heroes of the Last War, and now that the fighting is over most of them don't appreciate being used as local police. The Redcloaks are absolutely faithful to Breland: they are willing to lay down their lives in the service of their nation. Trying to bribe a Redcloak is a good way to lose a hand. Like the Blackened Book, however, the Redcloaks are elite troops that act only when they're mustered by a captain of the Watch; typically, they won't be asked to respond to a situation if it's not in the interests of the Boromar Clan. The Redcloak Battalion is described in more detail in {@book chapter 3|ERLW|8|The Redcloak Battalion}.": "{@b The Redcloak Battalion}是一支特殊的士兵部队，在需要极端军事力量的情况下被调用。红斗篷人是最后一次战争的英雄，现在战斗结束了，他们中的大多数人并不欣赏被当作地方警察使用。红环党人对布雷兰绝对忠诚：他们愿意为国家服务而牺牲自己的生命。试图贿赂红十字会的人是失去一只手的好办法。然而，和黑化书一样，红斗篷人是精英部队，只有在被守望者队长召集时才会行动；通常情况下，如果不符合博洛玛氏族的利益，他们不会被要求应对某种情况。红斗篷营在{@book chapter 3|ERLW|8|The Redcloak Battalion}中有更详细的描述。",
	"The Sharn Watch includes people from all walks of life: veterans of the Last War, retired adventurers, lifelong residents of the city, and immigrants who have become Brelish citizens. You can select from or roll on the Sharn Watch Races and Sharn Watch Personalities tables to generate a Watch NPC. There is a {@chance 75|75 percent} chance the NPC is taking bribes from the Boromar Clan or another wealthy patron. This doesn't necessarily mean that the officer is willing to take a bribe from one of the adventurers.": "沙恩守望包括各行各业的人：最后战争的老兵，退休的冒险家，城市的终身居民，以及已经成为布莱里什公民的移民。你可以从沙恩守望的种族和沙恩守望的性格表中选择或滚动来生成一个守望NPC。该NPC有{@chance 75|75 percent}的机会接受Boromar家族或其他富有的赞助人的贿赂。这并不一定意味着该官员愿意接受某个冒险者的贿赂。",
	"Brelish folk often forget that the Guardians of the Gate have a civilian branch that handles administrative issues and special customs investigations. Tethyn Olar has led that arm of the Sharn Watch for more than a decade.": "布雷利什人经常忘记，大门的守护者有一个民事部门，负责处理行政问题和特殊的海关调查。泰恩-奥拉领导沙恩守望的这一部门已经超过十年了。",
	"Many immigrants owe their safe and comfortable lives in our city to this man, but claims have surfaced recently charging him with corruption, saying that he took money from immigrants in exchange for a faster path into Sharn. Olar has refuted those claims with this statement: \"Look at the lower wards to see the vast number of poor immigrants the Gate allows to enter in the city. Those with wealth tend to be more responsible and quicker to put their paperwork together, but none with worthy cause to be here are barred.\"": "许多移民把他们在我们城市的安全和舒适的生活归功于这个人，但最近出现了指控他腐败的说法，说他从移民那里拿钱来换取进入沙恩的更快途径。奥拉尔用这个声明驳斥了这些说法。\"看看下面的病房就知道，城门允许进入的贫穷移民数量庞大。那些有财富的人往往更负责任，更快地把他们的文件放在一起，但没有一个有价值的理由在这里被禁止。\"",
	"Some of the Sharn Watch's most important people are as follows:": "沙恩表的一些最重要的人如下。",
	"Lord Commander Iyan ir'Talan is a male human in charge of the Sharn Watch. As long as the city's wealthy elite are content to keep Iyan in power, he does little more than maintain the status quo.": "伊安-伊尔-塔兰（Iyan ir'Talan）司令官是一名男性人类，负责沙恩守望的工作。只要这个城市的财富精英们满足于让伊安继续掌权，他所做的只是维持现状。",
	"Commander Lian Halamar is a male halfling who leads the garrison in the Daggerwatch district in Upper Dura. The Boromar Clan bribes Lian to make sure the Watch is away from the scene during their criminal activities. The Boromars are pressuring Lian to crack down on Daask, but he has no desire to put his officers in danger unnecessarily.": "指挥官Lian Halamar是一名男性半身人，在上杜拉的匕首守卫区领导驻军。波罗玛氏族贿赂廉，以确保在他们的犯罪活动中，守望者远离现场。波罗玛家族向廉施加压力，要求他打击达斯克，但他不想让他的官员陷入不必要的危险。",
	"Commander Belew Yorgan is a male dwarf who leads the Sword Point garrison in Middle Central. He does his best to serve the interests of the nobles and wealthy patrons in the Central Plateau, and as a result these wards are among the safest in Sharn. But Yorgan's loyalties are first and foremost to his purse, and the troops under his command serve whoever's paying the most.": "指挥官Belew Yorgan是一个男性矮人，他领导着中原地区的剑尖驻军。他尽力为中央高原的贵族和富有的赞助人的利益服务，因此，这些区是沙恩最安全的地方之一。但约根的忠诚度首先是对他的钱包，他手下的部队为谁付钱多就为谁服务。",
	"Commander Silaena Cazal is a female elf who runs the Warden Towers garrison in Middle Menthis. Over a century of service, she has woven a net of graft and extortion across Menthis Plateau; she looks after those who pay their dues. Her mother was driven from House Phiarlan when she developed an aberrant dragonmark. Because of that treatment, Silaena harbors deep resentment for the dragonmarked houses and will occasionally take actions to inconvenience them. Thora Tavin of House Tarkanan is working to strengthen her relationship with Commander Cazal.": "Silaena Cazal指挥官是一名女精灵，负责管理中Menthis的Warden Towers驻军。在一个多世纪的服务中，她在整个Menthis高原编织了一张贪污和敲诈的网；她照顾那些支付了会费的人。她的母亲在长出异常的龙纹时被赶出了Phiarlan家族。因为这种待遇，Silaena对有龙纹的家族怀有深深的怨恨，偶尔会采取一些行动给他们带来不便。塔卡南家族的索拉-塔文正在努力加强她与卡扎尔指挥官的关系。",
	"Commander Iyanna ir'Talan is a female human who commands the Black Arch garrison in Lower Tavick's Landing. The daughter of the Lord Commander, Iyanna is idealistic and honorable. She fights for the good of the common people. If the adventurers need an honest ally in the Watch, Iyanna is perhaps their best hope. Despite her father's best efforts to keep her from getting entangled in the criminal underworld, her actions have won her no friends among Sharn's crime lords, and her life could be in danger despite her parentage.": "指挥官Iyanna ir'Talan是一名女性人类，指挥下塔维克城的黑拱门驻军。作为司令官大人的女儿，伊扬娜是个理想主义者，也是个可敬的人。她为普通人的利益而战。如果冒险家们在守夜人中需要一个诚实的盟友，伊扬娜也许是他们最好的希望。尽管她的父亲竭力不让她卷入黑社会犯罪，但她的行为在沙恩的犯罪集团中没有赢得任何朋友，尽管她有父母之命，但她的生命可能会受到威胁。",
	"Lady Warden Maira ir'Talan, a distant relative of the Lord Commander, leads the Blackened Book. A gifted diviner, Maira is a highly effective leader. What none know is that she's also an agent of the Dreaming Dark. Five years ago, a {@creature kalaraq quori|ERLW} (see {@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}) named Tirashana implanted a mind seed in her thoughts. Maira continues to do her job while concealing any evidence of the Dreaming Dark's schemes.": "女典狱长梅拉-伊尔-塔兰（Maira ir'Talan）是指挥官大人的远房亲戚，领导着黑化书。作为一个有天赋的占卜师，梅拉是一个高效的领导者。没有人知道的是，她也是做梦的黑暗组织的代理人。五年前，一个名叫蒂拉萨娜的{@creature kalaraq quori|ERLW}（见{@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}）在她的思想中植入了一颗心灵种子。迈拉继续做她的工作，同时隐瞒了任何有关梦幻黑暗计划的证据。",

Daja firmly believes that the Guardians are all that stands between order and chaos in Sharn, and she acts with unbridled force if she believes a group or an individual threatens the city.": "达贾-布雷尔队长是一名女性人类，负责指挥大门的守护者。达贾坚信，守护者是沙恩的秩序与混乱之间的唯一屏障，如果她认为某个团体或个人威胁到城市，她会肆无忌惮地采取行动。",
	"Captain Khandan Dol is a male dwarf who leads the Redcloak Battalion. Khandan is a local legend who served in the Brelish army throughout the Last War; he was knighted by the last king of Galifar and swore an oath to the first queen of Breland. He enjoys drinking and gambling. He takes discipline seriously, though, and expects his soldiers to show complete loyalty to their country and its king.

	"If you want to make the Sharn Watch a significant part of the campaign, you can develop a story for a particular commander. Lian Halamar is the primary agent of the Boromar Clan, and if the adventurers are fighting the Clan, any interaction with the Watch can ultimately come to Lian's attention, with his corruption slowly becoming more and more evident. If the characters oppose House Tarkanan, it could be Commander Cazal who keeps interfering with their investigations and placing obstacles in their way. Can the adventurers find a way to remove their rival from power?": "如果你想让沙恩观察站成为战役的重要组成部分，你可以为某位指挥官制定一个故事。Lian Halamar是Boromar家族的主要代理人，如果冒险者们与该家族作战，那么与守望的任何互动最终都可以引起Lian的注意，他的腐败会慢慢变得越来越明显。如果人物反对塔卡南家族，可能是指挥官卡扎尔不断干扰他们的调查，在他们的路上设置障碍。冒险家们能找到办法将他们的对手赶下台吗？",
	"Another option is to focus a story on Commander Iyanna and her efforts to purge corruption from the Watch. A chance encounter could bring the two together; perhaps the adventurers are on the scene when Iyanna is targeted by assassins. Iyanna could call on the adventurers to investigate corruption and to deal with officers who are breaking their oaths. How deep are they willing to go?": "另一个选择是把故事的重点放在指挥官伊安娜和她为清除守望先锋的腐败所做的努力上。一次偶然的相遇可以让两人走到一起；也许冒险家们在现场看到伊扬娜被刺客盯上了。伊亚娜可以要求冒险家们调查腐败，并处理那些违背誓言的官员。他们愿意去多深的地方？",

	"{@b Eberron dragonshards} are found in shallow soil and often encased in geode-like stone shells. Eberron dragonshards can be found almost anywhere, but the most significant deposits have been discovered in jungle environments, notably Q'barra and Xen'drik. In their raw form, Eberron dragonshards are rosy crystals with crimson swirls flowing in their depths and are typically refined into a glowing powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use Eberron dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise (the dust's market value is the same as the replaced component). Eberron dragonshard dust is used in the creation of some magic items, and many powerful tools—such as the lightning rail and elemental airships—require an ongoing expenditure of Eberron dragonshards to maintain their enchantments.": "{@b Eberron dragonshards}是在浅层土壤中发现的，通常被包裹在类似于地球仪的石壳中。Eberron龙石几乎可以在任何地方找到，但最重要的矿藏是在丛林环境中发现的，特别是Q'barra和Xen'drik。艾伯伦龙石的原始形态是玫瑰色的晶体，深处流淌着深红色的漩涡，通常被提炼成一种发光的粉末。这种龙石粉几乎可以用来助长任何魔法行为。在施法时，你可以用艾伯伦龙石粉来代替任何有成本的法术组件，除非DM另有规定（龙石粉的市场价值与被替换的组件相同）。Eberron龙石粉被用于制造一些魔法物品，许多强大的工具--比如闪电轨道和元素飞艇--都需要持续消耗Eberron龙石粉来维持它们的魔法。",
	"{@b Khyber dragonshards} are found deep in the earth, often near layers of magma. These crystals typically grow on cavern walls, and superstition says they flourish in areas with significant fiendish activity. Khyber dragonshards are deep blue or dark violet, laced with gleaming veins. Khyber dragonshards have an affinity for binding magics. Elemental binding—which is behind airships, the lightning rail, and elemental galleons—requires a Khyber dragonshard to hold the elemental. Khyber shards are used for phylacteries, planar binding, and other effects that trap or manipulate spirits. Khyber dragonshards can also be used for necromantic rites.": "{@b Khyber dragonshards}是在地球深处发现的，通常在岩浆层附近。这些晶体通常生长在洞壁上，迷信的说法是它们在有大量恶魔活动的地区盛行。开伯尔龙石是深蓝色或深紫色的，带有闪亮的脉络。开伯尔龙纹石对束缚魔法有一种亲和力。元素束缚--这是在飞艇、闪电轨道和元素大帆船的背后--需要开伯尔龙纹石来固定元素。Khyber碎片用于法器、平面束缚以及其他困住或操纵精神的效果。开伯尔龙碎片也可用于亡灵仪式。",
	"{@b Siberys dragonshards} fall from the Ring of Siberys, the ring of crystals that encircles the world. While rare in Khorvaire, there are significant Siberys dragonshard fields in the continent of Xen'drik, and this is a potential source of great wealth for explorers. Siberys dragonshards are amber in color, with swirling golden veins gleaming within. These dragonshards are used in the crafting of magic items that require dragonmarks for attunement. Larger ones may be required for eldritch machines or the creation of legendary items or artifacts.": "{@b Siberys dragonshards}从环绕世界的水晶环Siberys落下。虽然在Khorvaire很罕见，但在Xen'drik大陆有大量的Siberys龙石矿，这对探险家来说是一个潜在的巨大财富来源。西伯利亚龙石是琥珀色的，里面闪烁着金色的漩涡纹。这些龙碎片被用于制作需要龙纹的魔法物品，以进行调和。较大的龙石可能需要用于制造长生机或创造传奇物品或神器。",

	"Some of the magic items in this chapter are symbiotic objects created by the daelkyr. While not fully sentient, these symbiotic items are partially organic. Attuning to such an item reflects physically bonding with it. While these objects aren't evil, some people might be disturbed upon seeing your living armor or tentacle whip!": "本章中的一些魔法物品是由daelkyr创造的共生物品。虽然不是完全有知觉的，但这些共生物品是部分有机的。适应这样的物品反映了与它的身体结合。虽然这些物品并不邪恶，但有些人在看到你的活体盔甲或触手鞭时可能会感到不安。",
	"In a Cannith enclave, a team of artificers maintain a creation forge that produces warforged. In the Shadow Marches, druids guard the seals that hold the daelkyr at bay. In the sewers below Sharn, a mad necromancer puts the final touches on a device that will turn the city's residents into undead. Such contraptions are categorized as eldritch machines—magical devices of immense power that are too large to be moved easily. Eldritch machines are marvels of magic and engineering that require special components and conditions to function. For example, a particular eldritch machine might function only in a manifest zone where two or more planes are coterminous.": "在坎尼斯的一块飞地上，一队工匠维护着一个生产战争锻造者的创造炉。在阴影地带，德鲁伊们守护着阻止达尔基尔的封印。在沙恩的下水道里，一个疯狂的死灵法师正在对一个将城市居民变成亡灵的装置进行最后的修饰。这种装置被归类为长生机--具有巨大力量的魔法装置，因为太大，所以不容易移动。长生机是魔法和工程的奇迹，需要特殊的部件和条件才能运作。例如，一个特殊的长生机可能只在两个或更多星球相邻的显化区发挥作用。",
	"Ultimately, eldritch machines are plot devices that can represent the culmination of a villain's master plan or a last defense against evil.": "归根结底，长生机是一种情节装置，可以代表一个反派的总体计划的高潮，也可以是对邪恶的最后防御。",
	"A creation forge is a spherical chamber that contains a floating obelisk. This obelisk creates warforged souls and places them in newly constructed warforged bodies. Only dragonmarked members of House Cannith can create and maintain such devices, and though the Treaty of Thronehold mandated the destruction of all creation forges in Khorvaire after the Last War, at least one creation forge is rumored to exist in the bowels of Sharn.": "创世锻炉是一个球形的房间，里面有一个漂浮的方尖碑。这个方尖碑创造出战锻的灵魂，并把它们放在新造的战锻身体里。只有拥有龙纹的坎尼斯家族成员才能创造和维护这样的设备，虽然《王座条约》规定在最后一次战争后要销毁霍尔韦尔的所有创造炉，但据传至少有一个创造炉存在于沙恩的地底。",
	"A dimensional seal is a massive stone slab covered with a complex pattern of runes and sigils. The seal projects an {@condition invisible} field in a 2-mile radius. This field blocks all forms of conjuration magic and any other effect that involves teleportation or planar travel. Dimensional seals are usually found in the Eldeen Reaches and the Shadow Marches—reminders of the conflict between the Gatekeepers and the daelkyr. The techniques used to create these seals have been long lost. It's said that as a whole, the dimensional seals keep the daelkyr bound in Khyber and prevent Xoriat from becoming coterminous with Eberron. If enough of these seals are destroyed, there could be dire consequences for the world.": "维度封印是一块巨大的石板，上面覆盖着复杂的符文和符号图案。封印会在2英里的范围内投射出一个{@condition invisible}的领域。这个领域会阻挡所有形式的魔法和任何其他涉及传送或平面旅行的效果。次元封印通常出现在艾尔丁峡谷（Eldeen Reaches）和阴影地带（Shadow Marches）--这是守门人和达尔凯尔（daelkyr）之间冲突的纪念物。创造这些封印的技术已经失传很久了。据说作为一个整体，维度封印将达尔凯尔束缚在开伯尔，并阻止索里亚特与埃伯龙成为同源。如果这些封印被破坏得足够多，可能会对世界造成可怕的后果。",
	"This dread device draws on the power of Mabar, infusing the dead with the malign energy of the Endless Night.

	"While this looks like a scrap heap assembled from shattered constructs, this eldritch machine possesses great power. A creature in control of it can sense the presence and location of all warforged within 10 miles of the device and can, as an action, send a telepathic message to them laced with enchantment magic. Such a message can be sent no more than once every 24 hours. A warforged who receives the message is compelled to follow one command contained within it, unless the warforged succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. The affected warforged breaks free of the command after 24 hours.": "虽然这看起来像一个由破碎的构造物组装而成的废品堆，但这个长生机拥有强大的力量。控制它的生物可以感应到设备周围10英里内所有战神的存在和位置，并且可以作为一个动作，向他们发送一个带有魔法的心灵感应信息。这样的信息每24小时最多发送一次。收到信息的战神会被强迫听从其中的一条命令，除非战神在DC12智慧救赎中成功。受影响的战神会在24小时后挣脱命令。",

The field can be activated or deactivated as an action with a touch by its controller.": "这个装置在半径为1到3英里的范围内发出一个反魔法场（与{@spell antimagic field}法术的效果相同）。该领域可以作为一个行动，由其控制者通过触摸来激活或停用。",
	"The form that the device takes depends on the nature of its creator. The Ashbound druids despise unnatural magic, so a spell sink created by them might be a living artifact, such as a twisted tree that consumes the magical energy around it. Conversely, a spell sink created by a mad artificer might be a massive vessel composed of dragonshards and exotic metals.": "该装置的形式取决于其创造者的性质。灰界德鲁伊鄙视非自然的魔法，所以他们创造的法术水槽可能是一个有生命的人工制品，比如一棵扭曲的树，消耗它周围的魔法能量。相反，一个疯狂的工匠创造的法术水槽可能是一个由龙石和异域金属组成的巨大容器。",

	"The daelkyr are the lords of madness and the emissaries of Xoriat, who invaded Eberron with a host of mind flayers, beholders, and other foul aberrations.

The warforged were treated as disposable soldiers, almost slaves, during the war, and the postwar arguments over what rights the warforged should be granted—as if fundamental rights were meant to be bestowed or withheld by political authorities—gave the warforged themselves no voice, as if they were still the property of their creators. {@creature The Lord of Blades|ERLW}' call to action is appealing to many warforged because it is grounded in legitimate grievances, even if the proposed action is abhorrent.": "对于卡瓦尔人的血肉之躯，{@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW} 是一个恐怖和痛苦的象征。但在他控制下的战争锻造人（和一些客观的其他种族观察者）认为，他的愤怒是由于战争锻造人在创造后遭受的不公所激发的。战争锻造人在战争期间被视为可有可无的士兵，几乎是奴隶，而战后关于战争锻造人应该被赋予什么权利的争论——仿佛基本权利是由政治当局赐予或剥夺的——使得战争锻造人自己无法发声，就好像他们仍然是创造者的财产。{@creature The Lord of Blades|ERLW} 的号召对许多战争锻造人具有吸引力，因为它根植于合法的不满，即使所提出的行动是可憎的。",

	"Some say that the dead-gray mist began in Metrol, initially flowing out of the royal palaces of Vermishard. Others swear that the disaster began in the Cannith stronghold of Making. All that is known is that the mist swiftly spread across the kingdom, transforming the lands and creatures caught within it. Over a million people died in the Mourning, including nearly all of the inhabitants of central Cyre. The mist slowed its advance as it spread, and some of those in the borderlands heard of the disaster in time to flee. Others survived because they were already beyond the borders of Cyre; the mist stopped mere feet away from the camps of Cyran soldiers holding sections of the Brelish front. And though the vast majority of people caught in the Mourning died, thousands did survive. Most have no clear memory of the event, and there's no explanation for why they were spared. The superstitious say that these people are cursed, that anyone touched by the Mourning is now an agent of darkness. (See the book's {@book introduction|ERLW|0} for further details on how the Mourning might have affected characters.)": "有人说，死灰色的雾气始于梅特洛尔(Metrol)，最初从沃米夏德(Vermishard)的皇家宫殿中涌出。其他人发誓，灾难始于坚铁(Cannith)要塞的制造之地(Making)。众所周知的是，这股雾气迅速蔓延到整个王国，改变了被困其中的土地和生物。在哀悼中，超过一百万人丧生，其中包括几乎所有中部赛尔(Cyre)的居民。随着蔓延，雾气减缓了前进速度，一些边境地区的人及时听闻灾难而逃离。其他人幸存是因为他们已经远离赛尔的边界；雾气仅仅停在了距离布瑞兰(Brelish)前线几英尺远的赛尔士兵营地外。尽管大多数陷入哀悼的人都死亡了，但仍有数千人幸存下来。大多数人对这一事件没有清晰的记忆，也没有解释为什么他们幸免于难。迷信者说这些人受到诅咒，任何被哀悼触及的人现在都是黑暗的代理人。(查看书中的{@book introduction|ERLW|0}，了解哀悼如何可能影响角色的更多细节。)",
	"The area covered by the mist is a shadowy, muffled region devoid of life, sunlight, and sound. The wall of mist ranges in thickness from a few hundred feet to as much as five miles. Travelers who linger in the mist suffer a growing sense of claustrophobia and despair. It's easy to get lost in the impenetrable fog, and some travelers have wandered in circles, unable to find their way either through the mist or back outside it, until their food or water ran out or they blundered into the path of some mutated terror.

Dreamlily dens can be found across the lower wards. Consuming dreamlily causes disorienting euphoria and brings about remarkable resistance to pain. A creature under the effects of dreamlily is {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, the creature is immune to fear, and the first time it drops to 0 hit points without being killed outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead. A dose of dreamlily costs around 1 gp, or up to ten times that if purchased through legal channels. There are many varieties of the drug, however, and the duration or the price might vary accordingly.": "{@b Dreamlily}. 一种致幻液体，闻起来和尝起来像你最喜欢的饮料，梦百合精华是萨隆安的一种鸦片。最初是为了在最后的战争期间帮助控制疼痛而进口的，现在已成为夏恩最常被滥用的物质。虽然如果用于药用目的，梦百合不是非法的，但它受到严重征税，因此大部分梦百合都是走私进来并在黑市上出售的。梦百合聚集点遍布下层区。消耗梦百合会导致令人困惑的欣快感，并带来显著的疼痛抵抗力。受梦百合影响的生物在1小时内是{@condition poisoned}。在这种方式下，生物对恐惧免疫，而且第一次在未被直接杀死的情况下降至0点生命值时，它会降至1点生命值。一剂梦百合的成本约为1 gp，如果通过合法渠道购买，价格可能高达这个数的十倍。然而，这种药物有许多种类，持续时间或价格可能会相应变化。",

She is the mastermind of the organization's machinations against the Boromar Clan, a scholar obsessed with studying Sharn's manifest zone, and a devoted servant of Sora Katra.

	"Long ago, the dragonmarked houses sought to exterminate the bearers of {@book aberrant dragonmarks|ERLW|2|Aberrant Dragonmarks}. Today, those who carry aberrant dragonmarks are still treated with fear and suspicion. During the Last War, the King's Dark Lanterns of Breland trained a team of covert operatives who all bore aberrant marks. Considered expendable, this group was sent on one suicide mission after another. After half its members died in the field, the survivors turned on their masters. Six years ago, they fled to Sharn and founded House Tarkanan.

	"The goblinoid champions of Dhakaan fought fiercely. But in the end, it was the orc Gatekeeper druids who closed the portals to Xoriat and drove the daelkyr into Khyber. The Gatekeepers crafted seals to hold both the power of Xoriat and the daelkyr at bay, and as long as those seals remain intact, the lords of madness can't rise from the depths. Today, those seals are thousands of years old and the Gatekeepers are all but forgotten.

	"The daelkyr {@creature Dyrrn|ERLW} the Corruptor enhanced the latent psychic abilities of changelings to develop doppelgangers, while implanting a desire to cause chaos in the communities around them.—even when there's no benefit in it for the doppelganger.

Others operate alone.": "腐化者大能者{@creature Dyrrn|ERLW}增强了幻化兽的潜在心灵能力，培育出了变形怪，同时植入了一种在周围社区制造混乱的欲望——即使对变形怪本身并没有好处。一些受到大能者幻象驱使的变形怪，可以在地下龙教或在凯伯与畸变生物一起战斗中找到。其他的则独自行动。",

Most mind flayers on Eberron dwell in Khyber with their daelkyr masters, commanding cities of dolgaunts and dolgrims.

	"{@b Talker}. From con artists to fences, anyone who relies on interpersonal skills and a network of contacts falls into the role of the Talker. Charisma proves useful for this role, along with proficiencies in skills such as {@skill Deception}, {@skill Intimidation}, and {@skill Persuasion}. The charlatan background is perfect for Talkers, but criminals, urchins, and others can fill the role with the right skills.

A good Dexterity score proves helpful in undertaking such tasks, especially if it's enhanced with proficiency with thieves' tools and the {@skill Sleight of Hand} and {@skill Stealth} skills.

	"{@b Investigator}. The Investigator is the archetypal spy, a master of deductive reasoning and suave interaction. Naturally, {@skill Investigation} can be a crucial skill, which many characters in this role combine with magical means of scrying to learn about their enemies and objectives.

Investigators come from backgrounds as varied as charlatans, nobles, sages, and urchins.": "{@b Investigator}. 调查员是典型的间谍，精通演绎推理和机智互动。自然地，{@skill Investigation} 可以是至关重要的技能，许多扮演这一角色的角色会结合使用魔法手段来窥探敌人和目标。 吟游诗人和巫师是天生的调查员，尤其是如果他们可以掌握 {@skill Deception}, {@skill Perception}, {@skill Persuasion}, 和 {@skill Stealth} 中的一个或多个技能。 调查员来自各种背景，如江湖骗子、贵族、学者和乞丐。",
	"{@b Saboteur}. The Saboteur interferes with the functioning of enemy assets. More than a reckless bomber, they combine a willingness to destroy with a knack for infiltration. Proficiency with thieves' tools and in skills such as {@skill Deception}, {@skill Investigation}, and {@skill Stealth} often serve the work of sabotage. The Saboteur benefits from an understanding of craft and magic items, making artificers particularly skilled in this role. Guild artisans might also disguise tools of destruction as mundane objects or works of art. Many Saboteurs come from backgrounds such as charlatans or soldiers.": "{@b Saboteur}. 破坏者干扰敌方资产的运作。他们不仅是鲁莽的炸弹客，还结合了摧毁意愿和渗透技巧。精通盗贼工具和{@skill Deception}、{@skill Investigation}、以及{@skill Stealth}等技能通常有助于进行破坏工作。破坏者需要了解工艺和魔法物品，使得铸师在这个角色中特别擅长。行会工匠也可能将破坏工具伪装成平凡物品或艺术品。许多破坏者出身于江湖骗子或士兵等背景。",
	"{@b Civil Servant}. The vast majority of work performed on behalf of a head of state has very little to do with deadly adventure: it's about prosecuting and judging criminals in the courts of law, hearing the petitions and complaints of citizens, collecting taxes, and interminable amounts of paperwork. Once in a while, though, a faithful Civil Servant gets forcefully pulled from this work and thrust into life-or-death situations, with or without help from more hardened adventurers. The knowledge and experience of a Civil Servant can often be useful, with some developing skills as clerics, rogues, wizards, or other classes. Such characters often come from the sage background and have proficiency in skills that reflect their studies, such as {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, {@skill Nature}, and {@skill Religion}.": "{@b Civil Servant}。绝大多数代表国家元首进行的工作与致命的冒险无关：它涉及在法庭上起诉和审判罪犯，听取公民的请愿和投诉，征收税款，以及大量的文书工作。然而，偶尔会有一位忠诚的公务员被强行从这项工作中拉出，并被推入生死关头的局面，无论有无更加坚韧的冒险者的帮助。公务员的知识和经验通常会派上用场，有些人会发展成为牧师、盗贼、巫师或其他职业。这样的角色通常来自智者背景，并具备反映他们研究的技能的熟练度，比如{@skill Arcana}、{@skill History}、{@skill Nature}和{@skill Religion}。",
	"{@b Diplomat}. Negotiating treaties, de-escalating conflicts, and issuing ultimatums are tasks that fall within the purview of the Diplomat, who typically puts their high Charisma to work in the service of the state. These characters often come from a noble background and bring proficiency in skills such as {@skill Intimidation} and {@skill Persuasion} to their work. Bards are natural fits in this role, as are paladins—as long as they aren't asked to do things that violate the tenets of their oaths.": "{@b Diplomat}. 谈判条约、缓解冲突和发出最后通牒是外交官的职责范围，他们通常会利用自己高超的魅力为国家服务。这些角色通常来自贵族背景，并在工作中带来了{@skill Intimidation}和{@skill Persuasion}等技能的熟练掌握。诗人和圣骑士在这个角色中自然而然地适合，只要他们不被要求做违背誓言原则的事情。",
	"{@b Marshal}. Combat is the specialty of the Marshal, who focuses on enforcing the law of the land and bringing fugitives to justice. Fighters and paladins make natural Marshals, many being former soldiers who continue fighting the Last War in different venues. They often have reasonable Intelligence scores or proficiency in {@skill Investigation}.": "{@b Marshal}. 战斗是(%1)(Marshal)的专长，他专注于执行土地法律并将逃犯绳之以法。战士和圣骑士是天生的(%1)(Marshal)，许多是前士兵，继续在不同场合参与最后的战争。他们通常具有合理的智力分数或(%1)(Marshal)的熟练加成。",
	"{@b Warden}. The Warden's focus isn't so much on the people of the nation, but on the land encompassed within its borders, both cultivated and wild. Sometimes that extends to protecting the border from incursions, but more often a Warden contend with monstrosities and wild beasts that threaten the populace, magical corruption that harms the land, and disasters jeopardizing the nation as a whole. Wardens are often rangers or druids, with proficiency in {@skill Nature} and {@skill Perception}. They might come from backgrounds as outlanders or hermits, making them more comfortable in the wilds than in cities or royal courts.": "{@b Warden}. 守林人的关注点并不是国家的人民，而是其边界内包括耕地和荒野的土地。有时这包括保护边界免受侵犯，但更常见的是守林人要对抗威胁人民的怪物和野兽、危害土地的魔法腐化以及危及整个国家的灾难。守林人通常是游侠或德鲁伊，擅长 {@skill Nature} 和 {@skill Perception}。他们可能来自异乡人或隐士的背景，使他们在荒野中感到更舒适，而不是在城市或皇家法庭。",
	"{@b Agent}. The Agent doesn't receive direct communications from an immortal patron, but puts faith in the dreams and inspiration of others, following such omens with an eager heart. This character is under no illusions of having a special role to play in the immortal's grand plans, but is ready to make sure those with such roles play them. This is often a character with no magical ability or sometimes from a scholarly background, such as a sage or hermit—perhaps someone familiar with lore about the immortal but not directly inspired by it. Agents typically have proficiency in skills such as {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, and {@skill Religion}.": "{@b Agent}. 代理人并不直接接收来自不朽保护者的通讯，而是相信他人的梦境和启示，怀着一颗渴望的心追随这些征兆。这个角色并不幻想自己在不朽者宏伟计划中扮演特殊角色，但愿意确保那些拥有这种角色的人能够履行自己的使命。这通常是一个没有魔法能力的角色，有时可能来自学者背景，比如智者或隐士——也许是熟悉有关不朽者的传说但并非直接受其启发的人。代理人通常擅长于诸如{@skill Arcana}、{@skill History}和{@skill Religion}等技能。",
	"{@b Visionary}. At least one character in the party should have a particular connection to your immortal patron. The Visionary might hear the patron's voice in dreams, see waking visions that convey the immortal's will, or interpret signs in accordance with prophecy. Different backgrounds might suggest different stories for a Visionary: An acolyte might have had a revelatory experience that paved the way for the immortal's communications. A hermit might have been plagued by disturbing dreams from youth. A sage might have made a lifetime study of the Draconic Prophecy. These characters are often clerics, druids, warlocks, or wizards, and typically proficient in skills such as {@skill Arcana} and {@skill Religion}.": "{@b Visionary}。派对中至少有一名角色应与你的不朽保护者有特殊联系。先知可能在梦中听到保护者的声音，看到清醒的幻象传达不朽者的意志，或者根据预言解读迹象。不同的背景可能暗示着不同的先知故事：侍僧可能曾经有过一次启示性的经历，为不朽者的交流铺平了道路。隐士可能从年轻时就被困扰着令人不安的梦境。贤者可能一生致力于龙语预言的研究。这些角色通常是牧师、德鲁伊、术士或巫师，通常擅长{@skill Arcana}和{@skill Religion}等技能。",
	"{@b Armory}. You can purchase nonmagical weapons and armor at a 20 percent discount at a facility associated with your military force. This might also be a location where you can buy magic items, at the DM's discretion, but you receive no discount.": "{@b Armory}。您可以以与您的军事力量相关的设施以八折的价格购买非魔法武器和盔甲。这也可能是您可以购买魔法物品的地点，由DM决定，但您将不享受折扣。",
	"Rather than join an existing force, you might choose to form your own mercenary outfit. You can assemble a unit of {@dice 3d10} soldiers housed in a headquarters with an armory, barracks, and private quarters for you and any other officers. Your group earns {@dice 3d20} gp per month, plus enough money to maintain your headquarters. You might be able to acquire weapons and armor through an arms dealer at a 20 percent discount, at the DM's discretion. You give the orders to those beneath you and take orders from no one, but that means that you are ultimately responsible for the activities of everyone in your outfit.": "与加入现有势力不同，你可以选择组建自己的雇佣兵团。你可以组建一个由{@dice 3d10}名士兵组成的单位，驻扎在一个设有军械库、兵营和你以及其他军官的私人住所的总部。你的团队每月赚取{@dice 3d20}金币，再加上足够的资金来维护你的总部。在DM的裁定下，你可能能够以八折价格从军火商那里购买武器和盔甲。你向下属下达命令，不接受他人的命令，但这也意味着你最终对你团队中每个人的活动负责。",
	"{@b The Boromar Clan}. The dominant crime syndicate in Sharn is still stinging from an exposé published ten years ago that resulted in the arrest of many of the clan's leaders and gave other gangs a foothold in the city. Members of the Boromar Clan go to great lengths—even murder—to sabotage {@i Chronicle} reporters who pry into their secrets.": "{@b The Boromar Clan}. 沙恩（Sharn）的主要犯罪集团仍然受到十年前的一篇揭露报道的打击，该报道导致该家族的许多领导被逮捕，并使其他帮派在城市中站稳脚跟。博罗玛家族的成员不惜一切代价，甚至杀人，来破坏{@i Chronicle}那些窥探他们秘密的记者。",
	"{@b Karrnath}. King Kaius nurses a grudge against the newspaper stemming from its coverage of the peace process at the end of the war, blaming them for several setbacks along the way to the eventual signing of the Treaty of Thronehold. {@i Chronicle} reporters operating in Karrnath often face harassment and find bureaucracy impeding their every effort.": "{@b Karrnath}. 凯乌斯国王对这家报纸怀有怨恨，源于他们在战争结束时对和平进程的报道，他认为他们在通往《王座安息条约》签署的道路上造成了几次挫折。{@i Chronicle} 在卡恩斯经营的记者经常面临骚扰，并发现官僚主义阻碍了他们的一切努力。",
	"{@b Face}. Typically gifted with a high Charisma score and skilled in a combination of {@skill Persuasion}, {@skill Intimidation}, and {@skill Insight}, the Face takes the lead in conducting interviews or talking the group's way past obstacles. A character with access to enchantment magic (such as a bard or sorcerer) can supplement natural Charisma with magical persuasion. A character with the charlatan background, proficiency in {@skill Deception}, or proficiency with a Disguise kit might also fill this role.": "{@b Face}. 通常天生具有较高的魅力分数，并擅长于{@skill Persuasion}、{@skill Intimidation}和{@skill Insight}的组合技能，面谈者在进行面试或帮助团队绕过障碍时发挥领导作用。具有催眠魔法访问权限的角色（如吟游诗人或巫师）可以用魔法说服力补充天生的魅力。具有江湖骗子背景、熟练掌握{@skill Deception}或熟练使用伪装工具包的角色也可能扮演这个角色。",
	"{@b Snoop}. A Snoop pries into secrets and pieces together the clues behind a sensational story. High Intelligence and proficiency in {@skill Investigation} often aids the core work of the Snoop, and knowledge of {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, or {@skill Religion} can be helpful for background research. Divination magic can also prove useful (perhaps in the hands of a wizard or a cleric), while a character with the sage background might have a knack for research.": "{@b Snoop}. 一个窥探者窥探秘密，拼凑出一个轰动故事背后的线索。高智力和{@skill Investigation}的熟练经常有助于窥探者的核心工作，对{@skill Arcana}、{@skill History}或{@skill Religion}的了解对背景研究也有帮助。占卜魔法也可能会派上用场（也许在一个巫师或牧师手中），而具有学者背景的角色可能擅长研究。",
	"{@b Scholar}. The Scholar brings academic knowledge to bear in the religious order's work, often in the form of proficiency in {@skill History} and {@skill Religion}. This character might be an expert on ancient ruins or know all the weaknesses of the demons they are hunting. Characters with access to divination magic (including clerics with the Knowledge domains as well as wizards) might excel at this role. Many Scholars come from the sage background. Unlike the Prophet and Zealot, the Scholar isn't necessarily devout, just knowledgeable.": "{@b Scholar}. 学者在宗教团体的工作中运用学术知识，通常表现为精通{@skill History}和{@skill Religion}。这个角色可能是古代遗迹的专家，或者了解他们正在追捕的恶魔的所有弱点。拥有占卜魔法的角色（包括拥有知识领域的牧师以及巫师）可能擅长这个角色。许多学者来自智者背景。与预言者和狂热者不同，学者不一定虔诚，只是博学。",
	"{@b Financier}. Whether they're hunting for grants or seeking donations from wealthy philanthropists, the Financier seeks the funds to pay for academic expeditions. Such characters might know their ways around ballrooms, boardrooms, and seedy taverns, willing to do whats necessary to get what they need. Those in this role often exude Charisma and might be adept with the {@skill Deception}, {@skill Intimidation}, and {@skill Persuasion} skills. Bards and rogues make natural academic Financiers, as do those with the charlatan and noble backgrounds.": "{@b Financier}. 无论是在寻找助学金还是向富有的慈善家募捐，财政家寻求资金来支付学术考察的费用。这样的角色可能熟悉舞厅、董事会和肮脏的酒馆，愿意做必要的事情来获得他们所需的。扮演这个角色的人通常散发着魅力，可能擅长{@skill Deception}、{@skill Intimidation} 和 {@skill Persuasion} 技能。诗人和流氓天生适合扮演学术财政家，还有那些具有江湖骗子和贵族背景的人。",
	"A Droaam tradition brought to Sharn by immigrants, six stones is a game for seven competitors, who each pay a base stake. The seven are then sealed in a large chamber with a {@creature cockatrice}. The match ends when six of the players have been turned to stone, at which point the survivor is awarded all the stakes (except for a share set aside for the organizers). A {@creature medusa} handler monitors the competition to ensure that rules are followed. Contestants carry no arms or armor, and no magic or supernatural abilities may be used. Additionally, no one is allowed to attack the cockatrice. The challenge lies in outlasting the other contestants and luring them or pushing them into the path of the cockatrice. The battleground might be barren or littered with rubble and cover; it might be lit, or it could be be pitch black.": "由移民带到沙恩的德罗阿姆传统，六石头是一个供七名竞争者参与的游戏，每人支付一个基本赌注。这七人随后被封闭在一个带有{@creature cockatrice}的大房间里。比赛在六名玩家变成石头时结束，幸存者将获得所有的赌注（除了一部分留给组织者）。一个{@creature medusa}处理者监督比赛以确保规则得到遵守。参赛者不携带武器或盔甲，也不能使用魔法或超自然能力。此外，任何人都不允许攻击那只鸡蛇。挑战在于比其他参赛者更持久，并诱使他们或推动他们进入鸡蛇的路径。战场可能是贫瘠的或散落着瓦砾和掩体；它可能被照亮，也可能是漆黑一片。",
	"It's easy to introduce the Aurum to the characters early in a campaign. Its members are public figures, sometimes eccentric but not necessarily evil. A Concordian could hire the adventurers to solve a mystery or to acquire a harmless curio. A Concordian could be tied to the party's group patron (see {@book chapter 1|ERLW|4})—the owner of the newspaper, a major donor to the university, or the power behind a criminal syndicate.": "在一个冒险活动的早期阶段向角色介绍黄金轻而易举。它的成员是公众人物，有时古怪但不一定邪恶。康科迪亚人可能会雇佣冒险者来解决一个谜团或获取一个无害的古玩。一个康科迪亚人可能与队伍的团体赞助人（参见{@book chapter 1|ERLW|4}）有关—可能是报纸的所有者、大学的主要捐赠者，或者是一个犯罪集团背后的势力。",
	"A cult of {@creature Dyrrn|ERLW} led by a {@creature mind flayer} kidnaps people with dragonmarks, seeking to decipher the marks and transfer them to others.": "一个由{@creature mind flayer}领导的{@creature Dyrrn|ERLW}邪教绑架带有龙印记的人，试图解读这些印记并将其转移给其他人。",
	"All dreams occur in the plane of Dal Quor. When mortals sleep, their minds touch the plane and shape a shard of it. Normally, a dream is shaped by the memories and emotions of the dreamer. But the {@spell dream} spell and similar effects (such as a night hag's Nightmare Haunting) can influence a dream from the outside, to a specific and often sinister purpose. The quori are masters of using the {@spell dream} spell as a weapon to terrorize their foes.": "所有梦境发生在达尔库尔平面(Dal Quor)中。当凡人入睡时，他们的意识会接触到这个平面，并塑造出其中的一小部分。通常，梦境是由做梦者的记忆和情感塑造而成的。但是{@spell dream}法术和类似效应（比如夜行女巫的梦魇扰乱）可以从外部影响梦境，达到特定且常常阴险的目的。库利(quori)是使用{@spell dream}法术来恐吓敌人的大师。",
	"{@b Znir Pact}. The gnolls of Droaam, once servants of {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW}, broke ties with the demons long ago and swore an oath of loyalty to the pack above all else. Since standing together and being bound by this Znir Pact, the gnolls have never been subjugated by any other force, and have never sought to conquer. Instead, they sell their services as hunters and soldiers, serving all warlords. The gnolls are trusted across Droaam.": "{@b Znir Pact}. 道罗姆的豺狼人，曾经是{@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW}的仆人，很久以前就与恶魔断绝了联系，并发誓忠于群体高于一切。自从团结一致并受到Znir誓约的约束以来，豺狼人从未被其他势力征服过，也从未试图征服。相反，他们将自己作为猎人和士兵的服务出售，为所有的军阀效力。豺狼人在整个道罗姆都备受信任。",
	"{@creature The Lord of Blades|ERLW} preaches of an apocalyptic future in which the warforged will destroy or enslave the nations of flesh and blood. \"We were made as weapons,\" {@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW} has declared over and over. \"Let us be weapons! Let the nations of the land reap what they have sown!\"": "{@creature The Lord of Blades|ERLW}预言了一个启示录般的未来，在那个未来中，战争锻造体将摧毁或奴役血肉之躯的国家。\"我们被创造成武器，\"{@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}一遍又一遍地宣称。\"让我们成为武器！让大地的国家收割他们所种下的果实！\"",
	"Today, warforged roam the Mournland in service to {@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}, patrolling the devastated terrain and salvaging resources from the ashes of Cyre. Most of these dissidents despise creatures of flesh, and any meeting with outsiders usually ends in blood being spilled. Other disciples of {@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW} launch attacks on targets across Khorvaire: destroying Cannith workshops, killing nobles known for their abuse of warforged, and seizing shipments of weapons or arcane research to further deplete their enemy.": "今天，战争锻造体在为{@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}效劳的情况下漫游在哀伤之地，巡逻着被摧毁的地形，并从塞尔的余烬中回收资源。这些叛逆者中的大多数都鄙视有血肉之躯的生物，与外来者的任何相遇通常都以鲜血洒落而告终。{@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}的其他信徒则对整个科瑞尔发动袭击：摧毁坎尼斯工坊，杀死因虐待战争锻造体而闻名的贵族，以及夺取武器或奥术研究的装运，以进一步削弱他们的敌人。",
	"Compared to the total number of warforged created and deployed in combat during the Last War, the followers of {@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW} are not especially numerous. His existence and message are well-known in the countries bordering the Mournland (especially Breland), but less familiar in the rest of Khorvaire. Hoping to swell the ranks of his followers, {@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW} has agents spreading his apocalyptic message in every city with significant warforged populations.": "与最后一次战争期间创造和部署的战争锻造人总数相比，{@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}的追随者并不特别众多。他的存在和信息在接壤哀伤之地的国家（尤其是布雷兰）广为人知，但在科瓦尔大陆其他地方不太熟悉。希望扩大他的追随者队伍，{@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}派遣特工在每个拥有大量战争锻造人口的城市传播他的启示信息。",
	"In the years following the war, {@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW} is a force to be reckoned with. The warforged are some of the few beings able to thrive in the desolation of the Mournland, so the followers of {@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW} are building a nation of their own amid the devastation. They search out and scour sites that were devastated in the Mourning to gather lost weapons and magic, all part of their preparations for full-scale war against the creatures of flesh.": "在战争过后的这些年里，{@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW} 是一个不可忽视的力量。战争锻造体是为数不多能够在悲伤之地茁壮成长的生物之一，因此{@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}的信徒们正在废墟之中建立起自己的国家。他们搜寻并搜刮在悲伤之地中被摧毁的地点，收集失落的武器和魔法，这都是为了他们对血肉生物发动全面战争的准备。",
	"{@creature The Lord of Blades|ERLW} can serve as a long-term opponent, as he continue to escalate his attacks over the course of the campaign. While he builds up his stronghold in the Mournland, he is also gathering the components to construct eldritch machines and other weapons. What would happen if {@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW} were to discover the power that caused the Mourning and unleashed that power across Khorvaire?": "{@creature The Lord of Blades|ERLW}可以成为一个长期的对手，因为他在整个冒险过程中不断升级他的攻击。在他在哀伤之地建立自己的据点的同时，他还在收集构建奥术机器和其他武器的组件。如果{@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}发现了引发哀伤的力量，并将这种力量释放到整个科瑞沃尔大陆，会发生什么？",
	"The Lords of Dust have two basic goals. The first is to encourage activities that strengthen the influence of their overlords. {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} embodies war and conflict, and his minions are always eager to cause strife. The servants of {@creature Sul Khatesh|ERLW} entice cruel and selfish people to become warlocks, drawing mystical powers from their mistress. These activities won't release an overlord, but they help to sustain it.": "尘埃之主有两个基本目标。第一个是鼓励加强他们的主宰的影响力的活动。{@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} 代表战争和冲突，他的追随者总是渴望制造纷争。{@creature Sul Khatesh|ERLW} 的仆人诱使残忍自私的人成为术士，从他们的女主人那里汲取神秘力量。这些活动不会释放一个主宰，但它们有助于维持它。",
	"Controlling a construct of such size proved to be a great challenge for the Cannith artificers. The solution entailed creating a large number of {@item docent|ERLW} nodes and joining them together in a single network distributed throughout the body of the colossus. Docent nodes are modeled after the ancient {@i docents} found in Xen'drik (described in {@book chapter 5|ERLW|12}), and though they lack the full sentience or functionality of a true {@item docent|ERLW}, collectively they can guide and control a colossus. The network converged at one place, where the captain could stand and control the colossus's every movement through the use of a mithral helmet with hundreds of semi-organic tendril-wires attached. By way of the central master {@item docent|ERLW}—a true {@item docent|ERLW} recovered from Xen'drik—the whole network fed information back to the operator. Several smaller \"hubs\" of the network gave other operators access to the relevant parts of that information and enabled them to control parts of the colossus as well. The techniques and tools used to create {@item docent|ERLW} nodes were lost in the Mourning. The various branches of House Cannith are sending adventurers into the Mournland in hopes of salvaging some or all of the network inside a fallen colossus.": "控制如此庞大的构造对坎尼斯工匠们来说是一个巨大的挑战。解决方案涉及创建大量{@item docent|ERLW}节点，并将它们连接在一起，分布在巨像的整个身体中。导师节点是根据在Xen'drik（在{@book chapter 5|ERLW|12}中描述）发现的古代{@i docents}模拟而成，尽管它们缺乏真正{@item docent|ERLW}的完整意识或功能，但它们集体可以引导和控制一个巨像。网络汇聚在一个地方，船长可以站在那里，通过佩戴一顶镶嵌着数百根半有机触须线的秘银头盔来控制巨像的每一个动作。通过中央主控{@item docent|ERLW}——一个从Xen'drik找回的真正{@item docent|ERLW}——整个网络将信息反馈给操作者。网络的几个较小的“枢纽”让其他操作者访问相关部分的信息，并使他们也能控制巨像的部分。用于创建{@item docent|ERLW}节点的技术和工具在哀伤事件中失落了。坎尼斯家族的各个分支正在派遣冒险者进入哀伤领地，希望能够打捞出一个倒下的巨像内部的部分或全部网络。",
	"Even though a colossus has fallen, its {@item docent|ERLW} nodes and elemental defenses might still be active. The dragonshards that once bound the elemental that powered the colossus's main weapon might have been broken, allowing the elemental to escape from its bondage and roam the body of the colossus, which has become its lair. Or perhaps it has come under the control of the master {@item docent|ERLW} and now does its twisted will, defending the interior of the colossus and giving voice and form to the {@item docent|ERLW}'s otherwise disembodied intelligence.": "尽管一个巨像已经倒下，它的{@item docent|ERLW}节点和元素防御可能仍然活跃。曾经捆绑着为巨像主要武器提供能量的元素的龙晶可能已经破碎，使得元素得以摆脱束缚并在巨像的身体中漫游，将其变成了自己的巢穴。或者它可能已经受到主人{@item docent|ERLW}的控制，现在执行着扭曲的意志，保卫着巨像的内部，并为{@item docent|ERLW}的无形智慧赋予声音和形态。",
	"A dragonmarked heir of House Lyrandar must pilot a Lyrandar airship, channeling the power of the Mark of Storm through the {@item wheel of wind and water|ERLW} that controls the vessel. The helm is typically situated near the rear of the ship, inside the shelter of a wheelhouse. Controlling the vessel (without the benefit of something like the {@i conductor stones} that dictate a lightning rail route) requires constant attention, so at least two pilots typically travel on every journey.": "一位来自莱兰达家族的龙印继承人必须驾驶一艘莱兰达飞艇，通过控制飞艇的{@item wheel of wind and water|ERLW}来引导风暴之印的力量。驾驶盘通常位于船尾附近，在一个轮船舵室的庇护下。控制飞艇（没有像{@i conductor stones}那样规定闪电轨道路线的帮助）需要持续的注意，因此每次旅程通常至少有两名飞行员一同前往。",
	"The placement of {@i conductor stone} lines dictates where a lightning rail train can travel, but the pilot still must make operational decisions as the coach moves from one city to the next. The pilot controls the vessel's speed based on conditions around the train. When {@i conductor stone} lines split, as they do at various hubs along the way, the pilot selects the intended route and directs the elemental down the correct line.": "{@i conductor stone}线的位置决定了闪电轨列车可以行驶的路线，但驾驶员仍然必须在车厢从一个城市到另一个城市时做出操作决策。驾驶员根据列车周围的情况控制船的速度。当{@i conductor stone}线分叉时，就像它们在途中的各个枢纽站那样，驾驶员选择预定的路线并指挥元素沿着正确的线路前进。",
	"Daask can also serve as a group patron for a party of adventurers, as described in {@book chapter 1|ERLW|4}.
