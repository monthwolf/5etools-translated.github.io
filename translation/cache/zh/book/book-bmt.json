	"Welcome to {@i The Book of Many Things}, whose twenty-two chapters give you character options, magic items, spells, monsters, ready-to-play adventures, DM advice, and setting elements designed to be dropped into your own campaign. And tying those chapters together is a legendary magic item that every player both dreads and longs for: the {@item Deck of Many Things}.": "欢迎来到{@i The Book of Many Things}，这里有二十二个章节，为您提供角色选项、魔法物品、法术、怪物、即插即玩的冒险、DM建议和设定元素，旨在融入您自己的战役中。连接这些章节的是一件传奇魔法物品，每个玩家都既害怕又渴望拥有：{@item Deck of Many Things}。",
	"For decades, DMs have used this infamous deck in their games, often with explosive results. Characters have been whisked off to extradimensional prisons, slain by death itself, lost levels, and earned the enmity of powerful fiends. But they've also gained vast wealth or a stronghold of their own, rewound time to reverse disaster, or suddenly advanced in level far beyond the other characters in the group. The awesome powers of the {@item Deck of Many Things} have given it a reputation as a game breaker. An encounter with the deck can spell the end of an otherwise successful campaign, as the DM's carefully prepared storyline and the players' lovingly created characters are scattered by the winds of fate to the corners of the multiverse.": "几十年来，DM们一直在游戏中使用这副臭名昭著的牌组，往往会产生爆炸性的结果。角色们可能会被传送到超维空间监狱，被死亡本身击杀，失去等级，招致强大恶魔的敌意。但他们也可能获得巨额财富或自己的要塞，倒带时间以扭转灾难，或者突然在等级上远远超过小组中的其他角色。{@item Deck of Many Things}的强大力量使其声名狼藉，被视为破坏游戏平衡的存在。与这副牌组的相遇可能意味着一个本来成功的冒险结束，因为DM精心准备的故事情节和玩家们精心创造的角色会被命运之风吹散到多元宇宙的各个角落。",
	"But it doesn't have to be that way. You can tailor the {@item Deck of Many Things} to your campaign, shaping it to fit your needs and the tastes of your players. You can stack the deck with low-level effects that prompt roleplaying instead of mechanical changes or create a deck that has only good cards (or bad ones!) in it. You can do all this without losing the wonder of the deck: its unique nature as a physical object that players—not just their characters—can hold in their hands.": "但并非一定要这样。你可以根据自己的活动主题来定制{@item Deck of Many Things}，使其符合你的需求和玩家的口味。你可以堆叠低级效果的牌，促使角色扮演，而不是进行机械性的改变，或者创建一副只有好牌（或坏牌！）的牌组。你可以做到所有这些，而不失去牌组的神奇之处：作为一种物理对象，玩家——不仅是他们的角色——可以亲手拿在手中。",
	"This book will show you how to tailor the deck for your game. This chapter presents a history of the deck throughout each edition of Dungeons & Dragons, then outlines the other chapters of this book, which are grouped by theme: DM options, character creation options, astrology-themed options, adventure locations, and finally adversaries and rivals.": "这本书将向您展示如何为您的游戏定制卡组。本章介绍了在每个版本的《龙与地下城（Dungeons & Dragons）》中卡组的历史，然后概述了本书的其他章节，这些章节按主题分组：DM选项、角色创建选项、占星主题选项、冒险地点，最后是对手和竞争对手。",
	"The {@item Deck of Many Things} is as old as D&D, but it's had many variations over almost fifty years.": "{@item Deck of Many Things} 象棋 as old as D&D, but it's had many variations over almost fifty years.",
	"The deck first appeared in print in 1975, in the pages of {@i Greyhawk}, the first supplement for the Dungeons & Dragons game. This earliest version of the deck established mechanical effects associated with the various cards. The deck was assembled with the face cards, aces, and jokers from an ordinary deck of playing cards. There were only eighteen cards in the deck, and none of them had names. But from the beginning, the deck was intended to be represented by a physical object players could hold.": "这副牌组首次出现在1975年的印刷品中，即《龙与地下城（Dungeons & Dragons）》游戏的第一个扩展包{@i Greyhawk}中。这副牌组的最早版本确定了与各种牌相关联的机械效果。这副牌组是用普通扑克牌的花牌、A和王牌组装而成的。这副牌组只有十八张牌，而且没有任何一张有名字。但从一开始，这副牌组就被设计成玩家可以拿在手里的物理物体。",
	"With the publication of the first {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} in 1979, the most recognizable aspects of the {@item Deck of Many Things} were established. Here, the names of the cards first appeared, and the deck was expanded to twenty-two cards. These changes signaled the deck's transition from something inspired by playing cards to one inspired by the tarot; a traditional tarot deck also has twenty-two named cards known as the major arcana. The {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} also introduced the idea that there was more than one version of the deck; there was also a more common and less powerful version with only thirteen cards.": "随着1979年首次出版的{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}，{@item Deck of Many Things}最具辨识度的特征得以确立。在这里，卡牌的名称首次出现，并且牌组扩展到了二十二张牌。这些变化标志着牌组从受扑克牌启发转变为受塔罗牌启发；传统的塔罗牌组也有二十二张被称为大阿卡纳的命名牌。{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}也引入了这样一个概念，即牌组有不止一种版本；还有一种更常见但不那么强大的版本，只有十三张牌。",
	"A different version of the deck appeared in 1983 in the pages of {@i Dragon} 77. \"The Tarot Deck of Many Things,\" written by Michael Lowry, reimagined the deck as a new magic item. The {@i Tarot Deck of Many Things} was a unique artifact created by \"the most powerful god of fate in the universe.\" It could be used to answer questions and reveal the future in the way of traditional tarot, and each of its seventy-eight cards had a unique effect when drawn.": "在1983年，{@i Dragon} 77期刊上出现了一种不同版本的牌组。《众多命运牌组》（The Tarot Deck of Many Things），由迈克尔·洛瑞（Michael Lowry）编写，将牌组重新构想为一种新的魔法物品。{@i Tarot Deck of Many Things} 是一件由\"宇宙中最强大的命运之神\"创造的独特神器。它可以用来回答问题，揭示未来的方式类似于传统塔罗牌，当抽取每一张牌时，都会产生独特的效果。",
	"In 1989, the {@item Deck of Many Things} expanded again. \"Luck of the Draw\" in {@i Dragon} 148 explored the deck through a conversation between a pompous wizard named Basil and his mercenary agent, a warrior named Jared. In this story, author Robin Jenkins offered answers for some of the deck's most enigmatic questions: who made the deck, and why? Jenkins, through Jared, suggested the deck—or, more properly, decks, since the cards were rare but not unique—were created by gods of luck dwelling on the plane of Concordant Opposition (known now as the Outlands) to test the greed of hapless adventurers. The cards were distributed throughout the world by leprechauns, who were familiar with such tests as custodians of the pots of gold at the ends of rainbows. Jenkins's expansion of the deck was unofficial, but it was illuminating, since the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} detailed how the deck worked but didn't explain what the deck was or how it came to exist. Those questions were left for individual Dungeon Masters to figure out—or simply leave unanswered.": "1989年，{@item Deck of Many Things}再次扩展。在{@i Dragon}148中，《抽签的幸运》通过一场对话探讨了一位自负的巫师巴西尔和他的雇佣军代理人、一名叫杰里德的战士。在这个故事中，作者罗宾·詹金斯为一些卡牌中最神秘的问题提供了答案：谁制作了这副牌，以及为什么？詹金斯通过杰里德暗示，这副牌——更准确地说，牌组，因为卡片虽然稀有但并非唯一——是由居住在和谐对立位面（现在被称为外域）的幸运之神创造的，用来测试不幸的冒险者的贪婪。这些卡片由小矮人分发到世界各地，他们作为彩虹尽头的金罐的看守者，熟悉这样的测试。詹金斯对牌组的扩展是非官方的，但具有启发性，因为{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}详细介绍了牌组的运作方式，但并没有解释这副牌是什么，以及它是如何产生的。这些问题留给各位地下城主自行解决，或者干脆不予回答。",
	"That same issue of {@i Dragon} also included the first physical replica of the deck, illustrated by George Barr and printed on card stock in the center of the magazine. At last, when characters found the {@item Deck of Many Things} in a treasure hoard, the DM could offer them a physical deck to draw from. Barr also detailed the backs of the cards for the first time. No design on the backs of the cards had ever been mentioned before, but here it gained a pair of dragons—one white, one black—embodying the deck's equal balance of positive and negative cards.": "同一期的《{@i Dragon}》也包括了第一套实体复制品，由乔治·巴尔（George Barr）绘制，并印刷在杂志中心的卡片上。最后，当角色在一个宝藏中发现了《{@item Deck of Many Things}》，DM可以提供给他们一副实体牌组来抽取。巴尔还首次详细描述了卡片的背面。以前从未提到过卡片背面的设计，但在这里它获得了一对龙——一个白色，一个黑色——体现了牌组正面和负面卡片平衡的特点。",
	"Around the same time, the adventure \"House of Cards\" appeared in {@i Dungeon} 19. This adventure by Randy Maxwell began as an urban sandbox with the characters investigating a thieves' guild. The guild's headquarters concealed a temple to Mask, the god of thieves in the Forgotten Realms, and the doors to the complex were insidiously trapped. Each of the twenty-two doors had one card from the {@item Deck of Many Things} built into it, so the door couldn't be opened without drawing the card. Moreover, the entire complex had been bolstered against an array of methods the characters might have taken to avoid interacting with the cards. To explore the dungeon, the characters had to draw every single card from the deck. This quickly became a resource-management puzzle: when the players knew one of their number would be imprisoned by the Donjon card, for example, or have their soul separated from their body by the Void card, how did they proceed?": "在大约相同的时间，冒险\"纸牌之屋\"出现在{@i Dungeon}19年。这个由兰迪·麦克斯韦尔（Randy Maxwell）创作的冒险开始于一个城市沙盒，角色们调查一个盗贼行会。行会的总部隐藏着一个供奉失落国度中的盗贼之神马斯克（Mask）的神庙，而整个建筑的门都被暗中设置了陷阱。22扇门中的每一扇都嵌有{@item Deck of Many Things}中的一张牌，因此门必须在抽取牌之后才能打开。此外，整个建筑都被加固，以防止角色们采取各种方法来避免与纸牌互动。为了探索地牢，角色们必须从牌堆中抽取每一张牌。这很快变成了一个资源管理难题：例如，当玩家们知道他们中的某个人将被\"地牢\"牌囚禁，或者被\"虚空\"牌将灵魂与身体分离时，他们该如何继续前进呢？",
	"When D&D was reimagined in its third edition, the new {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} included the {@item Deck of Many Things}. The mechanical effects of the cards and the card names remained largely unchanged from the first and second edition versions, but there were two important differences. Tarot cards had become much more familiar to players and were easier to find, so DMs were instructed how to build a {@item Deck of Many Things} from tarot cards in addition to playing cards. More importantly, the deck became a minor artifact, formally representing key features of the deck from previous editions: it was a magic item that characters couldn't create on their own.": "当D&D在第三版中重新构想时，新的{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}包括了{@item Deck of Many Things}。卡牌的机械效果和卡牌名称与第一版和第二版版本基本保持不变，但有两个重要的区别。塔罗牌对玩家来说变得更加熟悉且更易获得，因此DM被指示如何使用塔罗牌构建{@item Deck of Many Things}，除了使用扑克牌。更重要的是，这副牌成为了一个次级神器，正式代表了前几版中的关键特征：它是一个角色无法自行创建的魔法物品。",
	"Two versions of the deck were presented for the fourth edition of D&D. The first appeared in {@i Dungeon} 177 and was an artifact intended for heroes of levels 11–20; the second appeared a year later in the boxed adventure {@i Madness at Gardmore Abbey} (2011) and was aimed at levels 1–10.": "D&D第四版提供了两个版本的牌组。第一个出现在{@i Dungeon} 177年，是一个为11-20级英雄设计的神器；第二个在一年后出现在盒装冒险{@i Madness at Gardmore Abbey} (2011)中，针对1-10级的角色。",
	"But in the fourth edition of D&D, artifacts were more than just magic items that couldn't be duplicated; they had minds of their own and pursued secret purposes. The deck sought to sow chaos and topple powerful leaders regardless of whether they were good or evil. Characters who helped the deck pursue these goals were rewarded with favorable cards, while those who thwarted the deck were forced to draw multiple cards and keep the worst.": "但在D&D第四版中，神器不仅仅是无法复制的魔法物品；它们拥有自己的意识并追求秘密目的。这副牌追求播下混乱，推翻强大的领袖，无论他们是善是恶。帮助这副牌实现这些目标的角色将获得有利的牌，而阻挠这副牌的人将被迫抽取多张牌并保留最差的那张。",
	"A new origin for the deck was put forward but not confirmed in {@i Madness at Gardmore Abbey}: the deck was a gift from an archfey to a mighty emperor. As the archfey predicted, the emperor was unable to resist using the deck to cast his own future, and the deck shattered his empire. The deck also gained magical powers distinct from the cards' effects: wizards, sorcerers, and warlocks could use the deck to empower their spells.": "在{@i Madness at Gardmore Abbey}提出了一个新的牌组起源，但尚未得到确认：这副牌组是一位大能皇帝收到的一份来自一位大仙的礼物。正如大仙所预言的那样，皇帝无法抵挡使用这副牌组来预测自己未来的诱惑，结果导致这副牌组毁掉了他的帝国。这副牌组还获得了与卡牌效果不同的魔法力量：巫师、术士和咒术师可以使用这副牌组来增强他们的法术。",
	"The {@item Deck of Many Things} was central to {@i Madness at Gardmore Abbey}. Cards were scattered throughout the adventure, and the characters were charged with collecting them. Each card had unique powers, so characters could enjoy using the cards before the deck was fully assembled. But there was also a random factor inspired by the use of tarokka cards in the classic adventure {@i Ravenloft}. The DM could draw cards from the deck to determine the identity of their patron, the location of each card, and the scene of the adventure's denouement. To facilitate this, the adventure included another re-creation of the deck, with art by William O'Connor. (O'Connor's designs also appeared when Magic: The Gathering drew on the {@item Deck of Many Things} for a set inspired by the Forgotten Realms.) Like \"House of Cards,\" {@i Madness at Gardmore Abbey} forced characters to interact with the {@item Deck of Many Things}, but it rewarded them with new powers instead of punishing them and blocking all efforts to escape the deck.": "{@item Deck of Many Things}对{@i Madness at Gardmore Abbey}至关重要。卡牌散落在整个冒险中，角色们被委托收集它们。每张卡牌都有独特的能力，因此角色们在整副牌组装完之前就可以享受使用这些卡牌。但也受到了经典冒险{@i Ravenloft}中塔罗卡牌的启发，存在着随机因素。Dungeon Master可以从牌组中抽取卡牌，以确定他们的赞助人身份、每张卡牌的位置以及冒险结局的场景。为了方便这一点，冒险中还包括了另一个由William O'Connor设计的牌组。 （在魔术风云：集换式卡牌游戏中，当灵感来自被遗忘的国度的设定时，O'Connor的设计也出现了。）像《纸牌屋》一样，{@i Madness at Gardmore Abbey}迫使角色与{@item Deck of Many Things}互动，但它奖励他们新的力量，而不是惩罚他们并阻止所有逃离牌组的努力。",
	"The {@item Deck of Many Things} was revised yet again in 2014 for the fifth edition {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. O'Connor's art remained, and the thirteen-card version of the deck returned, but the deck was no longer an artifact and no longer sentient. This was the latest version of the deck in D&D—until now.": "{@item Deck of Many Things}在2014年再次修订，成为第五版{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}。奥康纳的艺术保留了下来，牌组恢复了十三张牌的版本，但牌组不再是神器，也不再有意识。这是D&D中最新的牌组版本—直到现在。",
	"{@i The Book of Many Things} explores and expands the deck. It isn't intelligent, but the original deck created by Istus for {@creature Asteria|BMT} and {@creature Euryale|BMT} is so powerful that it has countless lesser reflections throughout the multiverse, including versions with more, fewer, or different cards.": "{@i The Book of Many Things} 探索并扩展牌库。它并不聪明，但伊斯塔斯为{@creature Asteria|BMT}和{@creature Euryale|BMT}创造的原始牌库如此强大，以至于在多元宇宙中有无数个较小的反射版本，其中包括具有更多、更少或不同卡牌的版本。",
	"The deck has been in every edition of D&D, but there is no single \"best\" version of the deck. It has always been changing, and it always will. When you include the deck in your game, tailor it to your table so it does exactly what you want and need it to. That's what D&D has always done.": "这副牌在每一版D&D中都有，但没有一个单一的“最佳”版本。它一直在变化，而且它永远都会变化。当你在游戏中使用这副牌时，要根据你的游戏桌定制它，使其完全符合你想要和需要的效果。这就是D&D一直以来的做法。",

Sometimes a monster mentioned in this book includes a suggestion for an alternative chosen from {@book Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}, which you can use instead if you have that book.": "本书详细描述的冒险地点体现了{@item Deck of Many Things}的不可预测性。大多数地点没有预先确定的冒险者路径，也不针对特定等级的角色。相反，它们有多条分支路径和广泛的挑战范围。在某些地点遇到的怪物可能不足以对英雄构成身体上的挑战，而其他威胁可能如此危险，以至于冒险者必须撤退并在其他任务中获得1级或更多级别后才能返回。如果您使用这些冒险地点或战役元素之一，请将其改为符合您玩家的独特期望、您桌面的要求和您自己的口味。当一个生物的名称以{@b bold}类型出现时，这是一个视觉线索，指向其属性块。本书提到的大多数怪物出现在{@book Monster Manual|MM}中，但{@i The Book of Many Things}介绍了许多新怪物；完整列表出现在{@book chapter 21|BMT|20}中。有时，本书提到的怪物包括从{@book Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}中选择的替代建议，如果您有该书，可以使用该替代品。",
	"Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance as described in the text.": "当玩家的角色第一次抵达某个地点或根据文本描述出现特定情况时，类似这样出现在方框中的文本应该被朗读或者用自己的话解释给玩家听。",
	"If a stat block appears in this book or {@book Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}, the text where the monster is introduced tells you so. Likewise, spells mentioned in this book are described in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, and magic items are described in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} unless the text directs you to another chapter in this book.": "如果在本书中或{@book Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}出现了属性块，介绍怪物的文本会告诉你。同样，本书中提到的法术在{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中描述，魔法物品在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中描述，除非文本指引你查看本书的其他章节。",
	"{@item Deck of Many Things} is a complex magic item, and introducing one to your game can be challenging. This chapter addresses numerous topics especially important to the Dungeon Master:": "{@item Deck of Many Things}是一个复杂的魔法物品，将其引入游戏可能会具有挑战性。本章涵盖了许多对地牢主特别重要的主题：",
	"The origin and nature of the deck": "牌组的起源和性质",
	"Using a deck without disrupting your campaign (more than you want to)": "在不过多干扰你的战役（比你想要的）的情况下使用一副牌。",
	"Building a deck that contains only specific cards": "构建一个只包含特定卡牌的牌组 (Building a deck that contains only specific cards)",
	"Integrating a deck's effects into your campaign": "将牌组的效果融入你的战役中 (deck)",
	"How characters handle and use a deck in play": "角色如何在游戏中处理和使用一副牌。",
	"New magical effects associated with each card": "每张卡牌关联的新魔法效果",
	"Adventure seeds for characters who want to create their own cards": "想要创建自己的卡牌的角色的冒险种子\n\n1. 在(Stormhaven)的神秘市集上，一位神秘的老人向角色们提供了一批古老的卡牌材料，声称只有真正的冒险者才能将它们转化为强大的魔法卡牌。角色们必须踏上一场危险的冒险，寻找潜藏在世界各地的神秘能量，以完成这些卡牌的制作。\n\n2. 在(Whispering Woods)深处，一位占卜师声称她的卡牌能够揭示未来。然而，最近她的卡牌失踪了，而且她相信它们被一群恶意的精灵偷走了。角色们必须追踪这些精灵，找回卡牌，并学会如何利用它们来改变命运。\n\n3. 在(Shadowfell)的边缘，一位神秘的卡牌大师正在寻找有志之士来帮助他创造一套能够打破诅咒的卡牌。这些卡牌据说可以唤醒被黑暗力量困扰的城镇，并拯救被困在阴影中的灵魂。角色们必须面对黑暗的挑战，解开卡牌的力量，并将希望带给那些被黑暗笼罩的人们。",
	"The story of the {@item Deck of Many Things} began when a human woman named {@creature Asteria|BMT} bargained with Istus, a god of fate, to save the life of {@creature Euryale|BMT}, her dearest friend. As part of this bargain, Istus created a deck of twenty-two magical cards drawn from constellations in the night sky, and she used thirteen of these cards to change the destinies of {@creature Asteria|BMT} and {@creature Euryale|BMT}. These cards formed the first {@item Deck of Many Things}, an artifact with vast and unpredictable powers (the deck's origin is explored further in {@book chapter 22|BMT|21}).": "{@item Deck of Many Things} 的故事始于一个名叫{@creature Asteria|BMT}的人类女子与命运之神伊斯塔斯讨价还价，以拯救她最亲爱的朋友{@creature Euryale|BMT}的生命。作为这个交易的一部分，伊斯塔斯创造了一副由夜空中星座组成的二十二张魔法牌，她使用其中十三张牌改变了{@creature Asteria|BMT}和{@creature Euryale|BMT}的命运。这些牌形成了第一副{@item Deck of Many Things}，一个拥有巨大而不可预测力量的神器（这副牌的起源在{@book chapter 22|BMT|21}中进一步探讨）。",
	"Thanks to the deck's divine origin and unusual nature, it soon manifested in myriad lesser forms throughout the multiverse. Some of these wondrous items had fewer cards—typically only the thirteen cards used in Istus's reading for {@creature Asteria|BMT}. Occasionally a deck manifested as something else entirely: a circle of twenty-two doorways, or a die with twenty-two sides, each roll of which had the power to change an individual's destiny.": "由于这副牌具有神圣的起源和不寻常的特性，很快就在多元宇宙中以无数次级形式显现出来。其中一些奇妙的物品只有更少的牌—通常只有伊斯塔斯读取时使用的十三张牌{@creature Asteria|BMT}。偶尔，一副牌会以完全不同的形式显现出来：一个由二十二个门组成的圆圈，或者一个有二十二个面的骰子，每次投掷都有改变个人命运的力量。",
	"Soon those inspired by the deck sought to create their own magical cards. Most of these efforts resulted in entirely new magic items, such as the {@item Deck of Miscellany|BMT} (see {@book chapter 6|BMT|5|Deck of Miscellany}) or the {@item Deck of Wonder|BMT} (see {@book chapter 7|BMT|6|Deck of Wonder}). But occasionally, a legendary mage or a priest dedicated to the gods of fate and destiny succeeded in creating a new card that appeared alongside the {@item Deck of Many Things}, and that card replicated throughout the multiverse; these new cards make up the {@item Deck of Many More Things|BMT}, detailed in {@book chapter 7|BMT|6|Deck of Many More Things}.": "很快，那些受到这副牌启发的人开始尝试创造自己的魔法牌。其中大部分努力都导致全新的魔法物品，比如{@item Deck of Miscellany|BMT} (见{@book chapter 6|BMT|5|Deck of Miscellany}) 或 {@item Deck of Wonder|BMT} (见{@book chapter 7|BMT|6|Deck of Wonder})。但偶尔，一位传奇法师或致力于命运之神的祭司成功地创造出一张新牌，它出现在{@item Deck of Many Things} 旁边，这张牌在多元宇宙中复制传播；这些新牌构成了{@item Deck of Many More Things|BMT}，在{@book chapter 7|BMT|6|Deck of Many More Things}中有详细描述。",
	"{@i Decks of Many Things} have claimed many lives. Those who draw the Skull must fight an {@creature avatar of death|DMG}, and those slain by this avatar rise again as Undead, doomed to exist as long as the decks do. Over the centuries, these Undead gathered to form the Grim Harrow, a horde of merciless hunters traveling the multiverse on a quest to find and destroy every manifestation of the deck so they can end their doomed existence (see {@book chapter 19|BMT|18} for more on these beings). To combat these dangers, an angel founded the Solar Bastion (see {@book chapter 10|BMT|9}), a benevolent organization dedicated to protecting innocent people from the decks and the many dangers they pose.": "{@i Decks of Many Things}已夺走许多生命。那些抽到骷髅的人必须与{@creature avatar of death|DMG}战斗，而被这个化身杀死的人会再次升起成为不死族，注定要存在于牌堆之间。几个世纪以来，这些不死族聚集在一起，形成了残酷猎手的恐怖团体——严酷的猎手，他们在多元宇宙中旅行，寻找并摧毁每一个牌堆的表现，以结束他们注定的存在（有关这些生物的更多信息，请参见{@book chapter 19|BMT|18}）。为了对抗这些危险，一位天使创建了太阳堡垒（请参见{@book chapter 10|BMT|9}），一个致力于保护无辜人民免受牌堆和它们带来的众多危险的仁慈组织。",
	"The Grim Harrow and the Solar Bastion have learned much about the original deck over the centuries, but no one knows more about it than {@creature Asteria|BMT} herself, who still travels the multiverse living out the destiny foretold for her by Istus long ago.": "在过去几个世纪里，阴棘（The Grim Harrow）和日炉堡（The Solar Bastion）对原始牌组了解甚深，但没有人比{@creature Asteria|BMT}本人更了解它，她仍然穿梭于多元宇宙，过着伊斯塔斯（Istus）早已预言的命运。",
	"But in your campaign, the deck might have a different story. Perhaps the {@item Deck of Many Things} already existed when Istus used it to read {@creature Asteria|BMT}'s future, and it has another origin entirely. Perhaps it was the creation of a powerful faerie trickster or made by gods of chance as a test for greedy mortals. Use the story that best suits your campaign.": "但在你的冒险中，这副牌可能有一个不同的故事。也许在伊斯塔斯（Istus）用它来读取{@creature Asteria|BMT}的未来时，{@item Deck of Many Things}就已经存在了，它有完全不同的起源。也许它是一个强大的仙灵恶作剧者创造的，或者是由机遇之神创造的，作为对贪婪凡人的考验。使用最适合你冒险的故事。",
	"The power and unpredictability of a {@item Deck of Many Things} gives it the potential to wildly alter the course of campaigns. In an instant, characters could inherit a keep, shifting the campaign's focus to its defense and maintenance; a character could become separated from the rest of the party, trapped in an undetectable and unreachable prison; or characters could instantly perish. While some groups embrace such surprising twists, others prefer to avoid major campaign upsets.": "{@item Deck of Many Things}的力量和不可预测性使其具有极大的潜力来彻底改变战役的走向。一瞬间，角色可能会继承一座城堡，将战役的焦点转移到守卫和维护上；一个角色可能会与其余队伍分开，被困在一个无法被发现和到达的监狱中；或者角色可能会瞬间丧生。虽然一些团体欢迎这样令人惊讶的转折，但其他人更倾向于避免重大的战役颠覆。",
	"This book provides tools to help you use the deck on your own terms. The following sections detail two ways to head off potential complications before the characters draw their first card. \"{@book Customizing Your Deck|BMT|1|Customizing Your Deck}\" suggests strategies for stacking the deck with only cards that will be fun for your group. Meanwhile, \"{@book The Deck as Narrative|BMT|1|The Deck as Narrative}\" discusses having cards foreshadow future events, rather than triggering instantaneous effects, so you can incorporate the effects into your campaign when the time is right.": "这本书提供了工具，帮助你按照自己的方式使用牌组。以下部分详细介绍了两种在角色抽第一张牌之前防范潜在问题的方法。\"{@book Customizing Your Deck|BMT|1|Customizing Your Deck}\" 提出了一些策略，可以让你的团队只使用那些有趣的牌来堆叠牌组。与此同时，\"{@book The Deck as Narrative|BMT|1|The Deck as Narrative}\" 讨论了让牌预示未来事件，而不是立即触发效果，这样你可以在合适的时机将效果融入到你的战役中。",
	"The rest of this book also contains a wealth of advice and tools that address the challenges posed by specific cards. For example, the keep described in {@book chapter 15|BMT|14} is perfect for any character who draws the Throne card. The three powerful fiends found in {@book chapter 20|BMT|19} make ideal enemies for those who draw the Flames card. {@book Chapter 18|BMT|17} includes a full map of the Void's prison, as well as suggestions for working with players whose characters are imprisoned there. With these resources in hand, you'll be free to enjoy where the cards lead your characters.": "这本书的其余部分还包含了大量的建议和工具，用来应对特定卡牌带来的挑战。例如，在{@book chapter 15|BMT|14}中描述的遗迹非常适合抽到王座牌的角色。在{@book chapter 20|BMT|19}中发现的三个强大恶魔是那些抽到烈焰牌的人的理想敌人。{@book Chapter 18|BMT|17}包括虚空监狱的完整地图，以及与那里被囚禁的角色合作的建议。有了这些资源，你将可以尽情享受卡牌引领角色的旅程。",
	"The easiest way to ensure the {@item Deck of Many Things} doesn't radically alter your campaign is to limit the cards you include, selecting cards appropriate for the characters' level or that support the campaign's theme. The number and effects of the cards provided in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} are suggestions you can change as necessary. The deck has had many variations over D&D's history, so when you change it, you're in good company!": "确保 {@item Deck of Many Things} 不会彻底改变你的战役的最简单方法是限制你包含的卡牌，选择适合角色等级或支持战役主题的卡牌。 {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} 中提供的卡牌数量和效果仅供参考，您可以根据需要进行更改。D&D历史上的卡牌组合有很多变化，所以当你进行更改时，你是与众多玩家一起的！",
	"Here are examples of customized decks that reinforce a campaign's tone, appeal to particular kinds of players, or avoid specific dangers:": "这里有一些定制牌组的例子，可以加强战役的氛围，吸引特定类型的玩家，或避免特定的危险：",
	"This version of the {@item Deck of Many Things} is meant for low-level characters, potentially as low as 1st level: Comet, Fates, Fool, Key, Knight, Rogue, Ruin, Sage, Talons.": "这个版本的{@item Deck of Many Things}适用于低级角色，潜在地可以是1级：彗星，命运，愚者，钥匙，骑士，流氓，毁灭，智者，利爪。",
	"Players who enjoy intense roleplaying and interacting with nonplayer characters will get the most from this deck: Balance, Fates, Flames, Knight, Rogue, Ruin, Sage, Throne.": "喜欢进行激烈角色扮演并与非玩家角色互动的玩家将从这副牌中获益最多：平衡（Balance）, 命运（Fates）, 烈焰（Flames）, 骑士（Knight）, 流氓（Rogue）, 毁灭（Ruin）, 智者（Sage）, 王座（Throne）。",
	"Most of the cards in this deck bestow benefits on those who draw them, and the few exceptions are relatively easily recovered from: Comet, Fates, Fool, Gem, Jester, Key, Knight, Moon, Ruin, Sage, Star, Sun, Throne.": "这副牌组中的大多数牌都会给抽到它们的人带来好处，而少数例外相对容易克服：彗星，命运，愚者，宝石，小丑，钥匙，骑士，月亮，毁灭，贤者，星辰，太阳，王座。",
	"In this deck, perhaps found in Ravenloft or similar settings, harmful cards far outnumber helpful ones: Balance, Comet, Donjon, Euryale, Flames, Fool, Jester, Puzzle, Rogue, Ruin, Skull, Talons, Void.": "在这副牌中，也许在雷文洛夫（Ravenloft）或类似的场景中找到，有害的牌远远超过有益的牌：平衡（Balance），彗星（Comet），地牢（Donjon），尤里亚莉（Euryale），火焰（Flames），愚者（Fool），小丑（Jester），谜题（Puzzle），流氓（Rogue），毁灭（Ruin），骷髅（Skull），爪牙（Talons），虚空（Void）。",
	"You can supplement these decks with cards from the {@item Deck of Many More Things|BMT}, detailed in {@book chapter 7|BMT|6|Deck of Many More Things}.": "你可以用来自{@item Deck of Many More Things|BMT}的卡牌来增强这些牌组，详细信息见{@book chapter 7|BMT|6|Deck of Many More Things}。",
	"Traditionally, the effects created by the {@item Deck of Many Things} are immediate. When a character draws the Knight card, a fighter immediately appears and offers their service, and a character who draws the Gem card might be literally showered with riches. While this suits some campaigns, you can take a more narrative approach to the deck by having cards foreshadow future events that occur at a time of your choosing. When you use the deck in this way, drawing from it is less like pulling the lever on a cosmic slot machine and more like allowing a character to select a new story for themself without being allowed to know that story ahead of time.": "传统上，{@item Deck of Many Things}所创造的效果是立即生效的。当角色抽到骑士牌时，一名战士会立即出现并提供帮助，而抽到宝石牌的角色可能会被真正地淋上财富。虽然这适用于一些战役，但你可以通过让牌预示将来的事件并在你选择的时间发生来更加叙事化地使用牌组。当你以这种方式使用牌组时，从中抽取牌不再像是拉动宇宙老虎机的手柄，而更像是让角色选择一个新故事，而不被允许提前知道那个故事。",
	"With this narrative approach to the {@item Deck of Many Things}, you decide how to weave the events triggered by cards into your campaign. For example, a character who draws the Knight card might meet a warrior along the side of the road, in a tavern, or even trapped in a dangerous dungeon; by freeing the warrior, the character earns the warrior's loyalty. A character who draws the Gem card might find a rich store of jewels in their next treasure hoard, or they might inherit great wealth when a relative dies. Many of the chapters in this book include advice to help you work the effects of their cards into your campaign story.": "通过这种叙事方式来处理{@item Deck of Many Things}，你可以决定如何将卡牌触发的事件编织到你的冒险中。例如，抽到骑士牌的角色可能会在路边、酒馆里，甚至在危险的地牢中遇到一名战士；通过解救这名战士，角色会赢得战士的忠诚。抽到宝石牌的角色可能会在下一个宝藏中找到丰富的珠宝，或者在亲戚去世时继承巨额财富。本书的许多章节都包含建议，帮助你将卡牌效果融入你的冒险故事中。",
	"Using the deck's effects as events in your campaign poses an interesting question: is the deck predicting those events or causing them? If a character draws the Flames card, and soon after, minions of {@creature Aurnozci|BMT} (see {@book chapter 20|BMT|19|Aurnozci, the Caged Worm}) try to capture them, is this a direct result of drawing the card, or would the demons have attacked them anyway? {@i The Book of Many Things} doesn't answer this question; the answer is up to you and your players.": "在你的战役中将牌组效果当作事件使用，提出了一个有趣的问题：这副牌是在预测这些事件还是导致了这些事件？如果一个角色抽到了火焰牌，然后不久后，{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}的手下（见{@book chapter 20|BMT|19|Aurnozci, the Caged Worm}）试图抓住他们，这是抽到牌的直接结果，还是恶魔本来就会攻击他们？{@i The Book of Many Things}并没有回答这个问题；答案取决于你和你的玩家。",
	"When you take a narrative approach to the {@item Deck of Many Things}, don't put off card effects for too long. It's okay for players to wonder for a session or two exactly when and how the effects will manifest, and you can use that time to devise clever and memorable ways to interpret the effects and keep the players in suspense. For example, a beloved ally might come to hate a character who draws the Rogue card, and that ally might conceal their hatred for several sessions before revealing it in a moment of sudden treachery. But new stories soon crowd out the old, and players might not be impressed if a card takes too long to manifest.": "当你以叙事方式处理{@item Deck of Many Things}时，不要让卡牌效果拖得太久。玩家们可以在一两个游戏会话中好奇效果何时以及如何显现，你可以利用这段时间想出聪明而令人难忘的方式来解释效果，并让玩家们保持悬念。例如，一个深受喜爱的盟友可能会开始憎恨那位抽到了流氓卡牌的角色，而那个盟友可能会在几个游戏会话中隐藏他们的憎恨，直到在突然的背叛时揭示出来。但新故事很快就会淹没旧故事，如果一张卡牌花费太长时间才显现，玩家们可能不会感到惊讶。",
	"This book provides several ways to introduce the {@item Deck of Many Things} to your campaign, depending on the interests of your players and the kind of story you want to tell.": "这本书提供了几种方式来引入{@item Deck of Many Things}到你的冒险中，取决于你玩家的兴趣和你想讲述的故事类型。",
	"The mysterious faerie market described in {@book chapter 14|BMT|13} is home to a nilbog fortune teller named {@creature Oddlewin|BMT} who uses a {@item Deck of Many Things} to read the future of his customers. This might be the first time that characters see the deck, and if they're willing to perform a service for {@creature Oddlewin|BMT}, he might let them draw from it. This is a good way to introduce the deck to low-level characters.": "在{@book chapter 14|BMT|13}中描述的神秘仙灵市场是一个(nilbog)算命师{@creature Oddlewin|BMT}的家园，他使用{@item Deck of Many Things}来为顾客预测未来。这可能是角色第一次见到这副牌，如果他们愿意为{@creature Oddlewin|BMT}提供帮助，他可能会让他们从中抽取一张牌。这是向低级角色介绍这副牌的好方法。",
	"Heroes of a more adventurous bent might explore the ruins of Gardmore Abbey presented in {@book chapter 16|BMT|15}. The abbey has long been associated with the deck, since an ill-fated draw caused a massacre of both the knights who defended the site and the army that besieged them. Now the ruins are home to Mekkalath, a red dragon, and a {@item Deck of Many Things} lies in his hoard. Few adventurers are powerful enough to challenge Mekkalath directly, but where might is insufficient, guile and cunning can prevail.": "更加冒险的英雄可能会探索{@book chapter 16|BMT|15}中呈现的加德莫尔修道院的废墟。自从一次不幸的抽牌导致了捍卫该地点的骑士和围攻他们的军队的大屠杀以来，修道院长久以来就与这副牌联系在一起。现在废墟中栖息着梅卡拉斯（Mekkalath），一只红龙，他的藏宝中有{@item Deck of Many Things}。很少有冒险者有足够的力量直接挑战梅卡拉斯，但在力量不足的地方，智谋和狡诈可以取胜。",
	"Finally, the characters might simply be given a deck by someone who wants them to have it. {@creature Riffler|BMT|Rifflers}, mischievous fey presented in {@book chapter 21|BMT|20|Riffler}, are obsessed with the decks and constantly move them through the multiverse in a vain effort to manipulate destiny and complete a master plan only they understand. Alternatively, {@creature Asteria|BMT} or {@creature Euryale|BMT}, detailed in {@book chapter 22|BMT|21}, might give a deck to characters desperate to change their destiny.": "最后，角色们可能会被某人送给一副牌。{@creature Riffler|BMT|Rifflers}，在{@book chapter 21|BMT|20|Riffler}中描述的淘气的精灵，痴迷于这些牌，不断地将它们移动穿越多元宇宙，试图操纵命运并完成只有他们自己能理解的大计划。或者，{@book chapter 22|BMT|21}中描述的{@creature Asteria|BMT}或{@creature Euryale|BMT}，可能会把一副牌送给那些渴望改变命运的角色。",
	"Hello there! I've snuck some notes throughout this book—it felt appropriate, given my experience with this wondrous deck. May my words provide you with insight and inspiration!": "你好！我在这本书中偷偷藏了一些笔记——考虑到我对这副神奇牌组的经验，这样做感觉很合适。希望我的话能为你提供洞察和灵感！",
	"This section clarifies many things about how individuals can use and handle a {@item Deck of Many Things} without triggering its fantastic powers. New magical abilities for each card are also provided, allowing characters who find only a few cards to engage with this magic item in their adventures.": "这一部分阐明了个人如何在不触发其神奇力量的情况下使用和处理一张{@item Deck of Many Things}。还提供了每张卡片的新魔法能力，让那些只找到几张卡片的角色在冒险中使用这个魔法物品。",
	"You'll also find guidelines for characters who want to create new cards for the deck's complement, the {@item Deck of Many More Things|BMT}.": "您还会找到有关想要为牌组补充创建新卡片的角色的指导，{@item Deck of Many More Things|BMT}。",
	"The {@item Deck of Many Things} has the power to transform anyone who draws from it, but to trigger its effects, the individual handling the cards must state their desire to draw from it, as well as the number of cards they intend to draw. Otherwise, the deck's magical powers lie dormant. Anyone who identifies a deck learns this about the deck in the process, per the rules for {@book identifying magic items|DMG|7|Identifying a Magic Item}.": "{@item Deck of Many Things}具有改变任何抽取者的力量，但要触发其效果，处理这些牌的人必须声明他们想要抽取的愿望，以及他们打算抽取的牌的数量。否则，牌组的魔力将保持休眠状态。任何识别出这副牌组的人在这个过程中会了解到这一点，根据{@book identifying magic items|DMG|7|Identifying a Magic Item}的规则。",
	"This means that under normal circumstances, characters can handle a {@item Deck of Many Things} safely. A character who finds a deck can look at it, spread the cards out, and otherwise manipulate the cards without triggering their effects. This is why folk are able to use decks as divinatory tools, placing cards before themselves to gain insight into the future or personal dilemmas without triggering the cards' effects.": "这意味着在正常情况下，角色可以安全地处理一副{@item Deck of Many Things}。发现一副牌的角色可以查看它，展开卡牌，并以其他方式操作卡牌，而不会触发它们的效果。这就是为什么人们能够将牌组用作占卜工具，将卡片放在面前以获得对未来或个人困境的洞察，而不会触发卡片的效果。",
	"But accidents do happen. A curious stranger who spots a deck, face down, might reach out to draw the topmost card without realizing the import of their actions, spurring an adventure that draws the characters' attention. While the decks aren't sapient and have no thoughts or goals of their own, many people report feeling a compulsion to draw from decks whenever they are near.": "但是事故是会发生的。一个好奇的陌生人看到一副牌背朝上时，可能会伸手抽取最上面的一张牌，而没有意识到他们行为的重要性，从而引发一场吸引角色注意力的冒险。虽然这些牌组并非有智慧，也没有自己的想法或目标，但许多人报告在靠近时感到一种强烈的冲动去抽取牌组中的牌。",
	"A {@item Deck of Many Things} typically appears not as individual cards, but as a collection of cards characters can draw from. But this doesn't have to be true; you can give each card a property as a standalone item, so characters who find only one card can still enjoy this famed item and use the card on adventures.": "{@item Deck of Many Things}通常不是作为单独的卡片出现，而是作为角色可以抽取的一组卡片。但这并非一定如此；您可以将每张卡片赋予独立的属性，使只找到一张卡片的角色仍然可以享受这个著名物品，并在冒险中使用这张卡片。",
	"This approach is particularly useful if you make a {@item Deck of Many Things} the object of a quest; as the characters explore, each card they find grants them a magical ability they can use in subsequent adventures to find the cards that remain. Eventually the heroes assemble the entire deck, which they can then use in the traditional manner, drawing transformative cards from it in a fitting climax to the campaign.": "这种方法在你把{@item Deck of Many Things}作为任务目标时特别有用；当角色们探索时，他们发现的每张卡牌都赋予他们一种魔法能力，可以在随后的冒险中使用这些能力来找到剩下的卡牌。最终，英雄们集齐了整副牌，然后可以按照传统方式使用它，从中抽取变化的卡牌，为战役画上一个恰当的高潮。",
	"You can grant the following additional magical properties to the cards of the {@item Deck of Many Things}:": "你可以为{@item Deck of Many Things}的卡牌赋予以下额外的魔法属性：",
	"As an action, you can brandish this card at one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and drain its life force. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take {@dice 4d8} necrotic damage. You then regain a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage the target takes. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.": "作为一个动作，你可以向你能看到的30英尺内的一只生物挥舞这张卡牌，并吸取它的生命力。目标必须通过一次 DC 17 的体质豁免才能避免受到 {@dice 4d8} 死灵伤害。然后你回复等同于目标受到的死灵伤害的生命值。一旦这个效果被使用，直到第二天黎明前都不能再次使用。",
	"As an action, you can hold this card aloft and call down a fiery meteor to a point you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Each creature within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@dice 6d6} bludgeoning damage and {@dice 6d6} fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.": "作为一个动作，你可以举起这张卡并召唤一颗燃烧的陨石到你能看到的距离不超过120英尺的地点。以那个点为中心的20英尺半径范围内的每个生物必须进行一次DC 17的敏捷豁免检定。未通过豁免检定的生物会受到{@dice 6d6} 钝击伤害和{@dice 6d6} 火焰伤害，通过豁免检定的生物则只受到一半伤害。一旦这个效果被使用，直到第二天黎明前都不能再次使用。",
	"As an action, you can brandish this card at one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw, or it vanishes, transported to a prison on another plane of existence. After 1 minute, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.": "作为一个动作，你可以向你能看到的30英尺内的一名生物展示这张卡牌。目标必须成功通过一次DC 17的魅力豁免才能免受影响，否则它会消失，被传送到另一个存在的平面监狱。1分钟后，目标会重新出现在它离开的空间中，如果那个空间被占据，则会出现在最近的未被占据的空间中。一旦这个效果被使用，直到第二天黎明前都不能再次使用。",
	"As an action, you can brandish this card at one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and attempt to turn it to stone. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, or it begins to turn to stone and has the {@condition restrained} condition.

	"Anyone trying to make a card for the {@i Deck of Many More Things} must be at least 17th level. No formula for these cards exists, so the character must invent their own. While inventing the formula for such a potent magic item should take a long time, even years, a character can work on this project between or even on adventures. Characters might research their new formula by traveling to lost sites of ancient lore or locating others who have created cards of their own to learn how they accomplished this.": "任何试图制作{@i Deck of Many More Things}的卡片的角色必须至少是17级。这些卡片没有固定的配方，所以角色必须自己创造。虽然为这样一个强大的魔法物品创造配方应该需要很长时间，甚至几年，但角色可以在冒险之间甚至在冒险中进行这个项目。角色可以通过前往古代传说中的遗失之地或找到其他已经制作过自己卡片的人来研究他们是如何完成这个项目的。",
	"Once a character has invented the formula, they must acquire the magical ingredients—typically found only at great personal risk. Potential ingredients include magical inks made from crushed gemstones or the blood of legendary creatures, magical brushes or quills, and magical paper or other materials onto which the card must be painted (such as a dragon scale or a piece of the tarrasque's carapace). Great artistic skill is also required, so the creator might need to find a qualified artist or master the needed techniques themself. Furthermore, the magical ritual that creates the card must be performed at a specific time, perhaps when a particular constellation is in the sky. Divine intervention from a god of fate or destiny might be required.": "一旦角色发明了这个公式，他们必须获取神奇的材料——通常只能冒着极大的个人风险才能找到。潜在的材料包括由碎宝石或传奇生物的血制成的神奇墨水，神奇的刷子或羽毛笔，以及必须在其上绘制符文的神奇纸张或其他材料（比如龙鳞或塔拉斯克的甲壳碎片）。还需要极高的艺术技巧，因此创作者可能需要找到一个合格的艺术家或掌握所需的技术。此外，创造符文的神奇仪式必须在特定时间进行，也许是当特定星座出现在天空时。可能需要来自命运或宿命之神的神圣干预。",

	"As a reaction, when you take damage, gain resistance to that damage until the start of your next turn.": "作为一种反应，当你受到伤害时，获得对该伤害的抗性，直到你的下一个回合开始。",
	"Another way to use the inspiration deck is to make its effects available to monsters and villains. In this variant, each time a player expends inspiration, the DM also draws a card from the deck. Rather than adding it to the communal hand, you keep that card secret until you play it on behalf of one of the characters' opponents.": "另一种使用灵感牌组的方法是让怪物和反派角色也能享受其效果。在这种变体中，每当玩家使用灵感时，DM也会从牌组中抽取一张牌。与将其添加到共同手牌不同，你会将那张牌保密，直到代表其中一个角色的对手使用它。",
	"You can play your inspiration cards soon after drawing them or save them for use in major encounters. Note that saving your cards might make players more reluctant to use inspiration, worrying they need to conserve it for later encounters. Your players are likely to follow your example, so if you want them to use their inspiration cards freely, you should do so as well.": "你可以在抽到启发卡后立即使用，也可以留着在重要遭遇时再使用。请注意，保存卡片可能会让玩家更不愿使用启发，担心需要保留它们以备后续遭遇。你的玩家很可能会效仿你的做法，所以如果你希望他们自由使用启发卡，你也应该这样做。",
	"The journey spread is a means of making long journeys more interesting. In this method, you place cards in a particular arrangement (a spread) and interpret them based on their meaning, position, and orientation.

This method works best for a journey you expect to last at least as many days as you have players.": "旅程展开是使长途旅行更有趣的一种方法。在这种方法中，您按照特定的排列方式（一种展开）放置卡牌，并根据它们的含义、位置和方向进行解释。您可以使用{@item Deck of Many Things||The Deck of Many Things}卡牌套装、塔罗卡牌、塔罗牌牌组，或者任何您可以轻松赋予象征意义的卡牌。这种方法最适合您预计会持续至少与玩家数量相同的天数的旅程。",

This gives everyone at the table a visual representation of the journey and the characters' progress toward their destination.": "在旅程的每一天，将两张牌背面朝下摆放，一张叠在另一张上，形成一个旅程展示（见图表3.1）。这样可以让桌上的每个人直观地看到旅程以及角色朝着目的地的进展。",
	"At the beginning of each day of a journey, a player flips over the top card to determine what happens that day. (Players should take turns at this.) Use that card's imagery or symbolic meaning to inspire a choice or challenge the characters will face that day. The card could represent a site the characters come across on their journey, like a ruined tower or a fork in the road, or a situation the characters are asked to resolve. You decide the scope of the decision the characters must make. You can ask them to make a simple choice (\"Do you want to take the path along the edge of the cliff or climb down the ravine to walk along the bottom?\"), to make a single ability check (use the {@table Difficulty Class; Typical DCs||Typical DCs table} in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}), or to navigate their way through a small dungeon or an encounter (which might involve multiple ability checks or even combat). Let the character of the player who flipped the card be the focus of the day's events and make any required ability checks (though another character can help, at your discretion).": "在旅程的每一天开始时，玩家翻开顶部的牌来决定当天发生的事情。 （玩家应该轮流进行。）利用该牌的意象或象征意义来启发一个选择或挑战角色当天将面临的问题。 该牌可能代表角色在旅途中遇到的地点，比如一座废墟塔楼或岔路口，或者角色被要求解决的情况。 您决定角色必须做出的决定范围。 您可以要求他们做出简单的选择（“您想沿着悬崖边的小路走还是爬下峡谷沿着底部走？”），进行单个能力检定（使用{@table Difficulty Class; Typical DCs||Typical DCs table}在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中），或者引导他们穿过一个小地牢或遭遇（可能涉及多个能力检定甚至战斗）。 让翻开牌的玩家的角色成为当天事件的焦点，并进行任何必要的能力检定（尽管另一个角色可以在您的酌情下提供帮助）。",
	"Whatever choice or challenge you decide the top card represents, the characters' success or failure while dealing with that situation determines how you read the bottom card.": "无论你选择什么或者面对什么挑战，顶部的牌代表着，角色在处理这种情况时的成功或失败决定了你如何解读底部的牌。",
	"Once the situation presented by the top card has been resolved, the player can flip over the bottom card. Then it's up to you to interpret that card as either a reward or a ruin based on how well the players resolved the day's top card. If you're using cards that have a different meaning when they're upright versus upside down, ignore the cards' orientation.": "一旦顶部卡牌呈现的情况得到解决，玩家可以翻开底部的卡牌。然后由你来解释该卡牌是作为奖励还是毁灭，这取决于玩家们解决当天顶部卡牌的情况。如果你使用的卡牌在正立和倒立时有不同含义，忽略卡牌的朝向。",
	"When determining rewards, here are some effects to consider:": "确定奖励时，以下是一些要考虑的效果：",
	"The characters encounter another traveler or a friendly local resident who offers them food, shelter, information, or other assistance. The card can inspire both the characteristics of the person they meet and the nature of the aid that person provides.": "角色们遇到了另一个旅行者或友好的当地居民，他们提供食物、住所、信息或其他帮助。这张牌可以激发出他们所遇到的人的特点以及这个人提供的援助的性质。",
	"The characters have abundant food and water for this day and don't need to consume any of their rations. They eat well that night, and each character begins the next day with inspiration.": "角色们今天有充足的食物和水，不需要消耗任何口粮。他们晚上吃得很好，每个角色第二天开始时都获得灵感。",
	"The characters find a shortcut that reduces the time needed to reach their destination by a day. Remove the last pair of cards from the spread.": "角色们找到了一条捷径，可以缩短到达目的地所需的时间一天。从牌阵中移除最后一对牌。",
	"The characters find treasure inspired by the card as they overcome the day's challenges. If the card doesn't seem appropriate, use the {@book treasure tables|DMG|7|Random Magic Items} in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to determine the treasure instead.": "角色们在克服当天的挑战时，受到卡牌的启发，发现了宝藏。如果卡牌似乎不太合适，可以使用{@book treasure tables|DMG|7|Random Magic Items}在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中确定宝藏。",
	"When determining ruins, the following effects are broadly appropriate:": "在确定遗迹时，以下效果是广泛适用的：",

	"The stress of overcoming the challenge exhausts the characters. Each character gains 2 levels of {@condition exhaustion}.": "克服挑战的压力使角色筋疲力尽。每个角色获得2级{@condition exhaustion}。",
	"The characters' journey is extended by 1 day. Use the card, as well as the circumstances of the challenge, to narrate this setback: perhaps the characters became lost in the woods or encountered an obstacle blocking their path. Add two more cards to the spread.": "角色的旅程延长了1天。使用这张牌，以及挑战的情况，来叙述这个挫折：也许角色们在树林中迷路了，或者遇到了阻挡他们前进道路的障碍。再加两张牌到展开中。",
	"The characters lose their rations or are unable to forage for food and water. Alternatively, they might lose nonmagical equipment, such as a bedroll, a tent, or a pack animal.": "角色们失去了他们的口粮，或者无法觅食和饮水。另外，他们可能会失去非魔法装备，比如帐篷、睡袋或者（pack animal）。",
	"The characters are unable to finish a long rest before resuming their travels the next day.": "角色们无法在第二天恢复旅行前完成一次长休。",
	"Here is an example of how you might interpret cards from {@item Deck of Many Things||The Deck of Many Things} card set in a journey spread, with interpretations informed by the card descriptions in the reference book:": "这里是一个示例，说明你可能如何在旅程展开中解释{@item Deck of Many Things||The Deck of Many Things}卡牌套装中的卡牌，解释受到参考书中卡牌描述的启发。",
	"Sage (Upright). The Sage card suggests an opportunity to gain insight or advice. Perhaps the characters come to a promontory that allows them to see the surrounding terrain for many miles. Ask the character who flipped the card to make a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception} or {@skill Survival}) check to choose the best path.": "贤者（正位）。贤者牌暗示着获得洞察或建议的机会。也许角色们来到一个突出部，可以让他们看到周围数英里的地形。请让翻牌的角色进行一次 DC 15 的感知检定，选择最佳路径。",
	"Comet. Comets are harbingers of doom. If the character succeeds on the Wisdom check and chooses the better path, the characters' travel time decreases by a day, but their path is lined with omens that foretell terrible events when they reach their destination. If the character fails the Wisdom check and picks the worse path, the characters are troubled by nightmares that portend a disastrous future, preventing them from finishing a long rest that night.": "彗星。彗星是厄运的先兆。如果角色在感知检定中成功，并选择更好的道路，角色的旅行时间减少一天，但他们的道路上布满了预示着可怕事件的征兆，当他们到达目的地时将会发生。如果角色在感知检定中失败，并选择更糟糕的道路，角色会被噩梦所困扰，预示着一个灾难性的未来，使他们无法在那一晚完成长休息。",
	"Jester (Reversed). When reversed, this card can represent misfortunes piling up in a way that might be humorous if it weren't so disastrous. Imagine the worst possible day of hiking through the wilderness, and describe the litany of horrors the characters face: biting insects and leeches, a sudden rainstorm making a river impassible, a broken backpack strap, lost or moldy rations, blistered feet, sunburn once the rain has cleared, and so on. For each hindrance you devise, have one character (starting with the character of the player who flipped the card, then rotating through the party) make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw.": "小丑（逆位）。当逆位时，这张牌代表着不幸事件堆积在一起，如果不是那么灾难性的话，可能会有些幽默。想象一下在荒野中度过最糟糕的一天，描述人物们面临的一连串恐怖：叮咬的昆虫和水蛭、突如其来的暴雨使河流无法通行、背包带子断裂、丢失或发霉的口粮、起水泡的脚、暴雨过后晒伤，等等。对于你设计的每一个阻碍，让一个角色（从翻开这张牌的玩家角色开始，然后依次轮流到整个队伍）进行一次 DC 10 的体质豁免检定。",
	"Fool. If the characters succeed on the majority of these saving throws, they stumble across a treasure: a {@item Hat of Disguise} or a similar item used to fool or deceive. The reversed Fool card implies disappointment or lost innocence; if they fail most of the saving throws, they gain 2 levels of {@condition exhaustion}.": "愚者。如果角色在大多数豁免 throws 上成功，他们会偶然发现一宝藏：一个{@item Hat of Disguise}或类似用来愚弄或欺骗的物品。倒置的愚者牌意味着失望或失去纯真；如果他们在大多数豁免 throws 上失败，他们会获得2级{@condition exhaustion}。",
	"Donjon (Upright). This card can describe literal or metaphorical imprisonment. Perhaps the characters happen upon an eccentric's zoo, where monstrous animals are held in cruel captivity. The characters might decide to avoid the place entirely. Or they could free the monsters—hopefully avoiding the hungry ones—and confront the zoo's enraged owner.": "地牢（直立）。这张牌可以描述字面上或比喻性的囚禁。也许角色们偶然发现了一个古怪的动物园，那里的怪兽被残忍地囚禁着。角色们可能决定完全避开这个地方。或者他们可以释放这些怪兽——希望能避开那些饥饿的怪兽——并面对动物园愤怒的主人。",
	"Gem. If the characters overcome the challenges of the menagerie, they discover valuable treasures there; if not, they must face one additional trap or monster that uses the appearance of treasure as bait, such as a {@creature mimic}.": "宝石。如果角色们克服了兽栏的挑战，他们会在那里发现宝贵的宝藏；如果没有，他们必须面对一个额外的陷阱或怪物，它利用宝藏的外表作为诱饵，比如一个{@creature mimic}。",
	"Using cards to generate random encounters is a dynamic alternative to rolling on encounter tables. You can customize an encounter deck and remove cards as you draw them so they don't repeat. You can also alter the encounter deck as characters explore an area, adding cards to the deck to reflect changing circumstances and weaving the encounters into a narrative.": "使用卡牌生成随机遭遇是在遭遇表上掷骰子的动态替代方案。您可以自定义一个遭遇牌组，并在抽取卡牌时将其移除，以避免重复。您还可以随着角色探索区域而修改遭遇牌组，向牌组中添加卡牌以反映不断变化的情况，并将这些遭遇编织到故事情节中。",

	"Construct a deck of about twenty cards that each represent a creature (see the \"Constructing Your Deck\" section below). When an encounter occurs, shuffle the deck and draw a number of cards equal to the number of characters in the party. Use one or more of these cards to build the encounter, using the guidelines in the \"Choosing Monsters\" section below. When the encounter is over, discard the cards of any monsters that were killed, so they won't be drawn again.": "构建一副大约有二十张卡牌的牌组，每张卡牌代表一个生物(参见下面的\"构建你的牌组\"部分)。当遭遇发生时，洗牌并抽取与队伍中角色数量相等的卡牌。使用其中一张或多张卡牌来构建遭遇，根据下面\"选择怪物\"部分的指导方针。当遭遇结束时，丢弃任何被击败的怪物的卡牌，这样它们就不会再被抽到。",
	"An encounter deck consists primarily of cards representing monsters. You can use cards from {@item Deck of Many Things||The Deck of Many Things} card set, oracle cards, playing cards, cards from {@link Magic: The Gathering|https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?action=random}, or even index cards with your handwritten notes. Any kind of card works as long as each card can correlate with a specific monster. You can also add special cards for unusual events, as detailed below.": "遭遇牌组主要由代表怪物的卡牌组成。您可以使用来自{@item Deck of Many Things||The Deck of Many Things}卡牌套装、神谕卡、扑克牌、来自{@link Magic: The Gathering|https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?action=random}的卡牌，甚至是带有手写笔记的索引卡。只要每张卡片都能与特定怪物相关联，任何类型的卡片都可以使用。您还可以根据下面的详细信息添加用于不寻常事件的特殊卡。",
	"Choose ten to fifteen monsters with challenge ratings ranging from about half the level of the characters to 2 higher than their level. Usually you should include only one of the most powerful monsters, and you can include multiple copies of weaker monsters so they're more likely to be encountered.": "选择十到十五个挑战等级大约为角色等级一半到比他们高两级的怪物。通常你应该只包括一个最强大的怪物，你可以包括多个较弱的怪物的副本，这样它们更有可能被遇到。",
	"A group is a collection of creatures that might be encountered together. Identical creatures always form a group, but you can also form groups using other criteria. A group might be based on a shared creature type, such as Undead or Fiend, or might consist of creatures that often work together, such as gnolls and {@creature Hyena||hyenas}. Whenever you draw two or more creature cards of the same group for an encounter, those creatures work together against the party.": "一个群体是一组可能一起遭遇的生物。相同的生物总是会形成一个群体，但你也可以根据其他标准来组成群体。一个群体可能基于共享的生物类型，比如不死族或恶魔，或者可能由通常一起工作的生物组成，比如豺狼人和{@creature Hyena||hyenas}。每当你在遭遇中抽到两张或更多同一群体的生物卡时，这些生物将联合起来对抗队伍。",
	"Not all creatures need to belong to groups. You can add as many unaffiliated creatures as you like to your encounter deck. Create groups depending on how you'd like the characters to encounter the creatures.": "并非所有生物都需要属于团体。您可以向遭遇卡组中添加任意数量的无所属生物。根据您希望角色遭遇生物的方式，创建不同的团体。",
	"You can also designate single cards to represent two, three, or four creatures instead of just one. This ensures weak creatures appear in numbers sufficient to challenge the party without being overrepresented in the deck.": "你也可以指定单张牌代表两个、三个或四个生物，而不仅仅是一个。这样可以确保弱小的生物以足够的数量出现，以挑战队伍，而不会在牌组中过多地出现。",
	"You can include special cards in your encounter deck to add twists to encounters, such as surprise allies, additional adversaries, or goals the adventurers must accomplish. If you include special cards, a typical encounter deck of about twenty monster cards should also include three or four special cards.": "您可以在遭遇牌组中包含特殊牌，以增加遭遇的变数，比如意外盟友、额外对手，或者冒险者必须完成的目标。如果您包含特殊牌，一个典型的包含大约20张怪物卡的遭遇牌组也应该包含三到四张特殊牌。",
	"A friend is a creature that helps the characters fight the other creatures in an encounter. The friend might be the sole survivor of another adventuring party, a solitary traveler or recluse, or a benevolent monster like a {@creature flumph} or an angel. The friend might have information about the adventure location or the creatures that dwell there.": "朋友是在遭遇战中帮助角色与其他生物战斗的生物。这位朋友可能是另一个冒险队伍的唯一幸存者，一个孤独的旅行者或隐士，或者是一个善良的怪物，如{@creature flumph}或天使。这位朋友可能掌握有关冒险地点或居住在那里的生物的信息。",
	"When you draw a friend, set it aside. Then draw two additional cards and determine which foes the characters will face. The friend appears in the encounter with the other creatures, fighting on the side of the characters; you can let the players determine what the friend does on each of its turns.": "当你抽到一个朋友时，将其放在一边。然后再抽两张额外的牌，并确定角色将面对哪些敌人。这位朋友将出现在与其他生物的遭遇中，站在角色一边战斗；你可以让玩家决定这位朋友在每个回合中做什么。",

	"Flumphs are always friend-shaped.": "飘浮怪总是朋友般的形状。(Flumphs)",
	"A lurker is a sneaky, wandering opportunist that attacks the adventurers while they're fighting other creatures.": "潜伏者是一种隐秘、徘徊的机会主义者，在冒险者与其他生物战斗时发动袭击。",
	"When you draw a lurker card, set it aside and determine what foes the characters will face as normal. The lurker appears in the encounter separate from the other monsters, as far from the characters as reasonably possible and hiding if it can, attacking once the characters are distracted.": "当你抽到潜伏者卡时，将其放在一旁，并像平常一样确定角色将面对的敌人。潜伏者将出现在与其他怪物分开的遭遇中，尽可能远离角色，并在可能的情况下隐藏起来，等到角色分心时再发动攻击。",
	"Lurkers might include Humanoid foes like bandits, as well as ambush predators such as {@creature Violet Fungus|DoSI|violet fungi}, {@creature Roper||ropers}, and {@creature Gargoyle||gargoyles}.": "潜伏者可能包括人形敌人，如土匪，以及伏击捕食者，如{@creature Violet Fungus|DoSI|violet fungi}，{@creature Roper||ropers}和{@creature Gargoyle||gargoyles}。",
	"Twin creatures only appear together, though they need not be the same kind of creature.": "双生物只会一起出现，尽管它们不必是同一种生物。",
	"If you draw both twin cards when an encounter occurs, the twin creatures appear in the encounter. If you draw only one twin card, shuffle it back into the deck and form the encounter as normal.": "如果在遭遇发生时抽到了两张双生卡，那么双生生物会出现在遭遇中。如果只抽到了一张双生卡，将其洗回牌堆，然后按照正常方式组成遭遇。",
	"The twins could be a pair of {@creature Displacer Beast||displacer beasts} or a {@creature fire giant} with two pet {@creature Hell Hound||hell hounds} (with the two hell hounds represented by a single card). Because you're more likely to draw both twin cards when the encounter deck has thinned out, the twin encounter should make for a climactic battle. Each twin should have a challenge rating about equal to the characters' level.": "这对双胞胎可能是一对{@creature Displacer Beast||displacer beasts}，也可能是一对{@creature fire giant}，带着两只宠物{@creature Hell Hound||hell hounds}(两只地狱猎犬由一张卡片代表)。由于在遭遇牌堆变薄时更有可能抽到双胞胎卡片，双胞胎遭遇应该会带来一场高潮战斗。每个双胞胎的挑战等级应该大致等同于角色的等级。",
	"When you draw this card, discard it and draw two more. Don't return this card to the deck. You can also include a \"draw three\" card or even a \"draw four\" card.": "当你抽到这张卡时，弃掉它并再抽两张。不要将这张卡放回牌堆。你也可以包括一张“抽三张”卡，甚至是一张“抽四张”卡。",
	"You can add cards to represent creatures you don't expect the characters to fight, such as a peaceful {@creature stegosaurus|MPMM}, or scenes the characters might find, like a mysterious statue. When you draw one of these cards, decide whether to use it as the encounter or to build an encounter using the remaining cards.": "你可以添加卡片来代表你不希望角色与之战斗的生物，比如一个和平的{@creature stegosaurus|MPMM}，或者角色可能发现的场景，比如一个神秘的雕像。当你抽到这些卡片之一时，决定是将其用作遭遇，还是利用剩下的卡片来构建一个遭遇。",
	"You can also include one or more cards in an encounter deck to represent goals for the characters as they explore a region. For example, a goal card might represent an ancient ruin the characters are seeking. When that card appears, the adventurers find the site. A goal card could also represent a creature the characters are searching for.": "您也可以在遭遇牌组中包含一张或多张卡牌，代表角色在探索某个地区时的目标。例如，一个目标卡可能代表着角色正在寻找的一座古代遗迹。当这张卡出现时，冒险者们就会找到这个地点。目标卡也可以代表着角色正在寻找的一种生物。",
	"You don't want a goal to show up right away. If you draw a goal card earlier than you want, give the adventurers only a hint of the goal's presence: perhaps the monsters they encounter are hunting the same creature, and its tracks can still be found. Or the encounter might take place within an ancient construction similar to the ruin they're searching for. Draw a replacement for the goal card, and shuffle the goal card into the deck. You might allow the goal to elude the characters twice before they finally reach it.": "你不希望目标立即出现。如果你在希望之前抽到了目标卡，只给冒险者们一个目标存在的提示：也许他们遇到的怪物正在追捕同一种生物，它的踪迹仍然可以找到。或者这次遭遇可能发生在一个类似于他们正在寻找的废墟的古老建筑内。重新抽取一个目标卡，并将目标卡洗入牌堆。你可以让目标在角色最终找到它之前两次逃脱。",
	"Another way to handle a goal is to omit the goal card from the deck at the beginning of the session and shuffle it in when the characters reach a particular milestone. For example, suppose the goal is to defeat a {@creature gnoll fang of Yeenoghu} responsible for raiding nearby villages. There might be four ordinary {@creature Gnoll||gnolls} (minions of the fang of Yeenoghu) in the encounter deck. Once the characters have killed three of the minions, shuffle the goal card in. That way, the characters always meet the minions first.": "另一种处理目标的方法是在会话开始时从牌组中删除目标卡，并在角色达到特定里程碑时将其洗入牌组。例如，假设目标是击败一个{@creature gnoll fang of Yeenoghu}负责袭击附近村庄的敌人。在遭遇牌组中可能有四个普通{@creature Gnoll||gnolls}（伊诺古之牙的爪牙）角色。一旦角色杀死了三个爪牙，就将目标卡洗入牌组。这样，角色总是会先遇到这些爪牙。",
	"The goal card might also be one of a pair of twin cards, which both increases the chance that characters will find it later in their exploration and ensures that a specific creature (the other twin card) is always encountered with the goal.": "目标卡也可能是一对双胞胎卡之一，这样既增加了角色后来在探索中找到它的机会，又确保了与目标一起遇到的总是特定生物（另一张双胞胎卡）。",
	"Evolving your encounter deck fosters a sense of progress, creating a rough narrative arc as the adventurers explore an area. You can evolve the deck to make encounters progressively harder, or you can change the flavor of encounters, such as adding creatures from a particular environment.": "不断发展你的遭遇牌组有助于营造一种进步感，为冒险者在探索区域时创造一个大致的叙事弧线。你可以使遭遇逐渐变得更加困难，也可以改变遭遇的风格，比如添加来自特定环境的生物。",
	"One way to accomplish this is to build two encounter decks. Draw cards from the first encounter deck, and when you remove cards from that deck, replace those cards with an equal number of random cards from the second deck. This method is particularly effective if the second deck has a markedly different theme. You might start with an encounter deck featuring mostly dungeon scavengers, like {@creature Rat||rats} and {@creature Carrion Crawler||carrion crawlers}, then slowly add in cards from a deck made up of Undead creatures and cultists.": "一种实现这一目标的方法是构建两个遭遇牌组。从第一个遭遇牌组中抽取卡牌，当你从该牌组中移除卡牌时，用第二个牌组中相同数量的随机卡牌替换这些卡牌。如果第二个牌组具有明显不同的主题，这种方法尤其有效。你可以从一个主要由地牢清道夫，如{@creature Rat||rats}和{@creature Carrion Crawler||carrion crawlers}，组成的遭遇牌组开始，然后逐渐加入由不死生物和异教徒组成的牌组中的卡牌。",
	"Alternatively, you can use special cards such as noncombat encounter cards to tell you when to begin shuffling in cards from the second deck. For example, adventurers exploring a sylvan woodland might encounter mostly elves and Fey, but you might include a noncombat encounter card representing the party's discovery of a scorched clearing. After that encounter, you can start shuffling in cards representing gnolls and {@creature Hyena||hyenas}—the cause of the destruction.": "另外，您也可以使用特殊卡牌，比如非战斗遭遇卡，来告诉您何时开始从第二叠牌中洗入卡牌。例如，探索森林的冒险者可能会遇到大多数是精灵和精灵族，但您可以包括一张非战斗遭遇卡，代表队伍发现了一个被烧焦的空地。在那次遭遇之后，您可以开始洗入代表豺狼和{@creature Hyena||hyenas}——毁灭的原因的卡牌。",
	"If you have a goal card (see the \"{@book Special Cards|BMT|2|Special Cards}\" section above), you don't want the adventurers to reach the goal too early; don't put that card into the deck until the characters defeat one or more creatures from the second deck. At that point, shuffle the goal card into the second deck.": "如果你有一个目标卡（请参阅上面的“{@book Special Cards|BMT|2|Special Cards}”部分），你不希望冒险者们太早达到目标；在角色击败第二叠中的一个或多个生物之前，不要将该卡放入牌组。在那时，将目标卡洗入第二叠中。",
	"These sample decks, best suited for 4th- to 6th-level characters, feature monsters from the {@book Monster Manual|MM} and {@book Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}. If you don't have {@book Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}, omit those cards from the deck.": "这些示例卡组最适合4级至6级角色，包含来自{@book Monster Manual|MM}和{@book Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}的怪物。如果你没有{@book Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}，请从卡组中省略那些卡片。",
	"Entries with a multiplication sign indicate that the card represents multiple monsters. Monsters in the same group are assigned cards with the same face value (for example, all bandits are represented by king cards), but not all monsters with the same value are a group (the {@creature Owlbear||owlbears}, for example, hunt alone). This makes it easier to see when you've drawn multiple cards that form an encounter.": "带有乘号的条目表示该卡代表多个怪物。同一组中的怪物被分配具有相同面值的卡（例如，所有强盗都由国王卡代表），但并非所有具有相同面值的怪物都属于同一组（例如，{@creature Owlbear||owlbears}独自行动）。这样可以更容易地看出你抽到了组成一次遭遇的多张卡。",
	"You can use these decks as examples for building your own. You can use them separately when the characters are traveling through suitable terrain, or you can combine them (see \"{@book Evolving the Encounter Deck|BMT|2|Evolving the Encounter Deck}\" above), so characters who are exploring a forest (using the forest encounter deck) slowly discover the vile demonic influence corrupting the place as you shuffle in cards from the corrupted lands encounter deck.": "你可以以这些牌组作为构建自己牌组的示例。当角色穿越适合的地形时，你可以单独使用它们，或者你可以将它们合并起来（见上方的\"{@book Evolving the Encounter Deck|BMT|2|Evolving the Encounter Deck}\"），这样探索森林的角色（使用森林遭遇牌组）会慢慢发现那里邪恶的恶魔影响，当你从腐化土地遭遇牌组中洗入卡牌时。",

	"Each of the trap rooms described below includes a range of suggested character levels to match that room's difficulty.

	"If your characters are motivated primarily by money, wealth can threaten the entire campaign. After all, when mercenaries have all the money they'd ever need, why should they risk life and limb any more? Avoid this problem by ensuring your characters develop strong personal reasons to continue to adventure, even if they begin their adventuring careers in the pursuit of wealth. Perhaps they want revenge on a despicable villain, they enjoy exploring, or they crave the respect of their peers. Money won't provide any of these things, though it might make it easier to overcome obstacles along the way.": "如果你的角色主要受金钱驱使，财富可能会威胁整个冒险。毕竟，当雇佣兵拥有他们所需的所有金钱时，为什么他们还要冒生命危险呢？避免这个问题的方法是确保你的角色有强烈的个人原因继续冒险，即使他们开始冒险生涯是为了追求财富。也许他们想报复一个卑鄙的恶棍，他们喜欢探险，或者他们渴望同行的尊重。金钱不会提供这些东西，尽管它可能会让克服途中的障碍变得更容易。",
	"Characters who come into a lot of wealth might try to buy magic items that make them more powerful. Remember, you decide what magic items, if any, can be bought and sold in a settlement. You don't have to provide access to magic items too powerful for the characters. Expendable magic items, like scrolls and potions, are a good compromise; they're useful but have fewer long-term effects on your campaign. If an item still proves to be too powerful, you don't have to provide access to it again.": "当角色获得大量财富时，可能会尝试购买能让他们变得更强大的魔法物品。请记住，你可以决定在定居点内能够买卖哪些魔法物品，如果有的话。你不必提供对角色来说太强大的魔法物品。像卷轴和药水这样的消耗品魔法物品是一个不错的折中方案；它们很有用，但对你的战役影响较少。如果某个物品仍然被证明太强大，你不必再提供对它的获取。",
	"Wealth can transform people's lives; you just have to give the characters good reasons for spending their gold. Friends and loved ones, for example, can benefit from their largess, especially if these allies are experiencing hard times. If characters are attached to a settlement and its inhabitants, improving a neighborhood or the whole settlement can quickly expend their new wealth.": "财富可以改变人们的生活；你只需要给角色们花费他们的黄金一个好理由。例如，朋友和所爱的人可以受益于他们的慷慨，特别是如果这些盟友正在经历困难时期。如果角色们对一个定居点及其居民有感情，改善社区或整个定居点可以迅速消耗他们的新财富。",
	"But an ally shouldn't simply approach characters and ask for money; instead, make the ally's financial needs part of a story. For example, if a dragon destroys the castle of a just ruler and devours the ruler's family, characters might be expected to hunt down the dragon, but wealthy ones can pay for the castle to be rebuilt and buy enough diamonds to cast {@spell Resurrection} for the ruler and their entire family.": "但盟友不应该简单地接近角色并要求金钱；相反，让盟友的财务需求成为故事的一部分。例如，如果一条龙摧毁了一个正直统治者的城堡并吞食了统治者的家人，角色们可能会被期望追捕这条龙，但富有的角色可以支付重建城堡的费用，并购买足够的钻石为统治者和他们的整个家族施展{@spell Resurrection}。",

Finally, this chapter presents a collection of magic items and supernatural gifts: charms bestowed by the gods or other great powers, inspired by the {@item Deck of Many Things} and the concept of fate.": "这一章以两位冒险者的背景开始，他们的生活突然发生了逆转——从巅峰跌落或从悲剧中崛起。接着是一系列受{@item Deck of Many Things}启发的个性特征和生活事件。这些特征和事件反映了命运和宿命对你角色的影响。最后，本章介绍了一系列魔法物品和超自然礼物：这些是神灵或其他强大力量赐予的护符，灵感来源于{@item Deck of Many Things}和命运的概念。",

	"The Fated Destinies table provides narrative ideas inspired by the {@item Deck of Many Things} that you can use as prompts while developing your character.

When using this table, you can choose the entries that speak to you or randomly pull cards from {@item Deck of Many Things||The Deck of Many Things} card set.": "《命运宿命表》提供了受到{@item Deck of Many Things}启发的叙事想法，您可以在塑造角色时使用它们作为提示。这些条目适用于依赖信仰、信念或命运的角色，尤其是牧师、德鲁伊和圣骑士，但任何角色的故事都可以从中受益。在使用这个表格时，您可以选择对您有意义的条目，或者随机从{@item Deck of Many Things||The Deck of Many Things}卡牌套装中抽取卡片。",
	"The prompts can be personality traits, relationships, or events. Most are described as part of your character's past, but they might foretell events in your character's future. Consider how much your character knows about the destinies detailed in the table; these events might be a mystery to your character, shared only between you and your DM. Or perhaps your character learned about these events through omens or the readings of a fortune teller.": "提示可以是个性特征、关系或事件。大多数被描述为你角色过去的一部分，但它们可能预示着你角色未来的事件。考虑你的角色对表中详细描述的命运了解多少；这些事件对你的角色可能是个谜，只有你和DM知道。或者你的角色可能通过预兆或占卜师的预言了解到这些事件。",

	"This section provides advice for DMs whose characters draw the Knight card from a {@item Deck of Many Things}, as well as general advice about including allies who fight alongside the characters. Finally, the knight summoned by the deck is reimagined as a loyal Construct: the deck defender.": "这一部分为DM们提供了关于当角色从{@item Deck of Many Things}中抽到骑士牌时的建议，以及关于如何包括与角色一起战斗的盟友的一般建议。最后，牌组召唤的骑士被重新构想为一名忠诚的构装：牌组守护者。",
	"The {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} details how the nonplayer character summoned by the Knight card of a {@item Deck of Many Things} appears. But as discussed in {@book chapter 2|BMT|1}, the cards of the {@item Deck of Many Things} can instead be interpreted as narrative directions that point the way to a future event. In this case, the Knight card could portend a friendly warrior whom the character will soon meet—and who could become a loyal ally.": "在《{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}》中详细描述了由{@item Deck of Many Things}的骑士卡召唤出的非玩家角色的出现方式。但正如在{@book chapter 2|BMT|1}中讨论的那样，{@item Deck of Many Things}的卡牌可以被解释为指向未来事件的叙事指引。在这种情况下，骑士卡可能预示着主角很快会遇到的友好战士，他可能会成为忠实的盟友。",
	"When the Knight card is used as a narrative device in this way, the ally it brings isn't magically summoned or compelled to obey the characters; the deck has merely foretold the ally's imminent arrival. Consider what motivates this ally to accompany the party. This ally could be new or familiar to the characters, and the ally might be repaying a favor or pursuing goals of their own.": "当骑士(%num%)牌被用作叙事设备时，它所带来的盟友并不是被魔法召唤或强迫服从角色的；牌组只是预示了盟友即将到来。考虑一下是什么激励这个盟友跟随队伍。这个盟友可能对角色是新的或熟悉的，盟友可能是在回报一个恩惠或追求自己的目标。",
	"Several kinds of allies are described below, each with a different reason for accompanying the party. Guidance on when the ally might depart is also provided. An ally who befriends the characters might linger in the story long after the ally's personal goals have been accomplished (especially if the players enjoy that NPC). If you're using {@item Deck of Many Things||The Deck of Many Things} card set to foretell the future, boxed text for each ally provides dialogue a fortune teller might use to tell characters of the ally's imminent arrival.": "以下描述了几种不同类型的盟友，每个盟友跟随队伍的原因各不相同。还提供了盟友可能离开的指引。一个与角色交好的盟友可能会在盟友个人目标实现后继续留在故事中（尤其是如果玩家喜欢这个NPC的话）。如果你正在使用{@item Deck of Many Things||The Deck of Many Things}卡牌套装来预测未来，每个盟友的方框文本提供了一个占卜师可能用来告诉角色盟友即将到来的对话。",
	"Whatever type of ally you choose, the party should encounter this ally soon after drawing the card—within a few days or even sooner.": "无论你选择什么类型的盟友，队伍应该在抽到这张牌后不久就会遇到这个盟友——可能是在几天内，甚至更快。",
	"Your good deeds shall be rewarded; gratitude becomes guardianship.": "你的善行将会得到回报；感恩将成为守护。",
	"This ally is grateful to the characters; perhaps the characters saved the ally's life or helped the ally in a significant way. This is an especially good way to bring back an ally the characters liked but left behind in their adventures. The ally accompanies the characters until the ally considers their debt repaid, perhaps by saving a character's life.": "这位盟友对角色们心怀感激；也许是角色们拯救了这位盟友的生命，或者在重要的时刻帮助了这位盟友。这是一个特别好的方式，可以让角色们重新带上他们喜欢但在冒险中留下的盟友。这位盟友会一直陪伴着角色们，直到他们认为自己的债务已经偿还，也许是通过拯救了某个角色的生命。",
	"If the ally is someone the characters already know, the fortune teller might hint at the ally's appearance or name.": "如果盟友是角色们已经认识的人，占卜师可能会暗示盟友的外貌或姓名。",
	"Find the one who searches; you need not look far, and both of you will benefit.": "寻找那个搜寻者；你无需远行，你们两个都会受益。",
	"This ally hopes to find someone or something in a place the characters are going to. The object of the ally's quest is of utmost importance—such as a family member, a lost heirloom, or an ingredient for an obscure ritual. The ally remains with the characters until the ally can emerge safely from danger with the person or item they're seeking. If the ally is seeking a magic item hidden deep in a dungeon, for example, the ally helps the adventurers complete their mission after finding the item.": "这位盟友希望在角色即将前往的地方找到某人或某物。盟友的任务目标至关重要，比如家庭成员、失落的传家宝物，或者某种神秘仪式所需的材料。盟友将与角色们同行，直到能够安全地从危险中出来，并带着他们正在寻找的人或物。例如，如果盟友正在寻找一个隐藏在地牢深处的魔法物品，盟友在找到物品后会帮助冒险者们完成他们的任务。",
	"The fortune teller might hint at the person or thing the ally is seeking.": "占卜者可能会暗示盟友正在寻找的人或事物。",
	"Knowledge is power, and someone who chases knowledge shall seek you out.": "知识就是力量，而追求知识的人会寻找你。",
	"This ally wishes to study a particular dungeon, region, or creature. The ally might be a historian, planar explorer, botanist, or zoologist. Because the Knight card usually summons a warrior, a studious ally might be a bit of a surprise for the characters—someone they dismiss as unrelated to the {@item Deck of Many Things} until the scholar draws a weapon and ably defends themself in battle. The studious ally remains with the characters as long as there are more secrets to learn; when the characters leave the region the ally is interested in, the ally amiably parts ways with them.": "这位盟友希望研究特定的地牢、地区或生物。这位盟友可能是一位历史学家、位面探险家、植物学家或动物学家。由于骑士卡通常召唤一名战士，一位好学的盟友可能会让角色们感到惊讶——他们可能会被认为与{@item Deck of Many Things}无关，直到学者拔出武器并在战斗中熟练地保护自己。只要还有更多的秘密可以学习，这位好学的盟友就会与角色们同行；当角色们离开盟友感兴趣的地区时，盟友会友好地与他们分道扬镳。",
	"A fortune teller might divine the region or topic the studious ally is interested in, giving the characters a direction when they want to seek the ally out.": "一个算命师可能会预测出那位勤奋的盟友感兴趣的领域或主题，为角色们提供了一个方向，当他们想去找到这位盟友时。",
	"Look for the one with a grudge to bear; a common foe will bring your paths together.": "寻找那个怀恨在心的人；一个共同的敌人会让你们的道路交汇。(Dungeons & Dragons)",
	"This ally shares a common enemy with the characters. The ally had someone or something taken from them by a terrible monster or villain—someone the characters also oppose or soon will. Now, the ally hopes to slay that villain or bring it to justice, accompanying the characters until this task is done.": "这位盟友与角色们有着共同的敌人。这位盟友曾经被一只可怕的怪物或恶棍夺走了某人或某物——正是角色们也反对的人，或者很快会反对的人。现在，这位盟友希望杀死那个恶棍或将其绳之以法，一直陪伴角色们直到这个任务完成。",
	"The fortune teller might be able to divine who this common enemy is, even if the characters haven't yet encountered that foe.": "占卜师也许能够预言出这个共同敌人是谁，即使角色们还没有遇到过那个敌人。",
	"Allies are an important part of any adventuring party's career. However, whenever an ally joins the party for a significant amount of time, it's important the ally doesn't overshadow the player characters. Here are some ways to keep the party feeling like heroes, even when the cast of characters grows.": "盟友是任何冒险团队事业中重要的一部分。然而，每当一个盟友加入团队并在一段时间内参与冒险时，重要的是确保盟友不要盖过玩家角色。以下是一些方法，可以让团队在角色阵容增加的情况下仍然感觉像英雄。",
	"Sometimes our paths cross with others' in the most fortuitous ways, bringing us allies and even friends. And though our lives may eventually diverge from theirs, that doesn't make the friendships any less meaningful.": "有时候我们与他人的道路在最幸运的方式交汇，给我们带来盟友甚至朋友。虽然我们的生活最终可能会与他们分道扬镳，但这并不会减少友谊的意义。",
	"Consider letting your players control the ally. This can be a great way to keep more players involved if the party splits; when any player's usual character isn't present in a scene, they play the ally instead. It's helpful to give the ally a couple of distinguishing personality traits or mannerisms—such as greed, a love of beer, or a favorite expression—to make it easier to roleplay the ally on a moment's notice.": "考虑让玩家控制盟友。这是一个很好的方法，可以让更多玩家参与进来，如果队伍分裂；当任何玩家通常扮演的角色不在场景中时，他们可以扮演盟友。为盟友赋予一些独特的个性特征或习惯——比如贪婪、热爱啤酒或者一个常用的口头禅——可以让在需要时更容易扮演盟友。",
	"If you don't want the players to have the ally's character sheet or stat block, you can ask them what they'd like the ally to do and fulfill their requests. The ally might be eager for instruction, dutifully carrying out orders in the heat of battle. This is especially useful for allies who serve as the bodyguard for a wizard character or who partner with a rogue character to help the rogue perform sneak attacks. In this case, you can explain the ally's capabilities to the players so that the party can best use the ally.": "如果你不希望玩家拥有盟友的角色卡或属性块，你可以询问他们想让盟友做什么，然后满足他们的要求。盟友可能渴望指示，在战斗的激烈时刻忠实地执行命令。这对于那些作为巫师角色的护卫或与盗贼角色合作进行偷袭的盟友特别有用。在这种情况下，你可以向玩家解释盟友的能力，以便队伍最好地利用盟友。",
	"Players can feel undervalued if an ally is outperforming their characters. While an overly powerful ally is fine on rare occasion, the players should still feel like their characters are the true heroes of the story.": "如果一个盟友的表现超过了他们的角色，玩家可能会感到被低估。尽管偶尔有一个过于强大的盟友是可以接受的，但玩家仍应该觉得他们的角色是故事中真正的英雄。",
	"If you're building the ally as if it were a character, keep the ally 1 or 2 levels below the characters. If you're using a monster stat block instead, make sure its hit points and damage output aren't outpacing the characters', and be wary of powerful monster abilities, skill proficiencies, and spellcasting.": "如果你把盟友当作一个角色来构建，让盟友的等级保持在角色的1或2级以下。如果你使用怪物的属性块，确保它的生命值和伤害输出不要超过角色的，并注意强大的怪物能力、技能熟练度和施法能力。",
	"One way to avoid overshadowing the characters is to create an ally who has skills and abilities that complement the party's. Healing, tracking, and proficiency with thieves' tools (to disarm traps and unlock doors) are common examples of such skills. A group without magical healing isn't going to complain when an NPC cleric joins their party, so long as the cleric focuses on healing!": "避免掩盖角色的一种方法是创建一个盟友，他具有能够补充队伍的技能和能力。治疗、追踪和熟练使用盗贼工具（用于拆除陷阱和开锁）是这种技能的常见例子。一个没有魔法治疗的团队，当一个NPC牧师加入他们的队伍时，不会抱怨，只要牧师专注于治疗！",
	"Similarly, you can give an ally abilities that bolster or otherwise support the characters without dealing damage on their own, such as the {@spell Bless} spell or Bardic Inspiration. Perhaps the ally prefers to use the {@action Help} action, and if a character's ability check or attack succeeds with the ally's help, the ally grants an additional benefit. These tactics keep the spotlight on the characters, with the ally providing valuable support.": "同样地，你可以赋予盟友能力，这些能力可以增强或以其他方式支持角色，而不会自己造成伤害，比如{@spell Bless}法术或诗人灵感(Bardic Inspiration)。也许这个盟友更喜欢使用{@action Help}行动，如果角色在盟友的帮助下成功进行能力检定或攻击，盟友会提供额外的好处。这些策略可以让角色保持关注度，而盟友提供宝贵的支持。",
	"In larger parties, adding an ally can slow down combat. Consider having the ally tag along for only a session or two, or limit the encounters they appear in. Maybe the ally helps the characters in only a certain region or part of town and then leaves to attend to other duties. The important thing is that the ally is available when the characters want them and retreats into the background when the characters don't want or need the help.": "在较大的派对中，添加一个盟友可能会减慢战斗节奏。考虑让盟友只在一两个场景中跟随，或限制他们出现的遭遇。也许盟友只在某个特定地区或城镇的一部分帮助角色，然后离开去处理其他事务。重要的是，当角色需要时盟友是可用的，并且在角色不需要帮助时退到幕后。",
	"Consider ways the ally could help the characters off-screen. The ally could defend the characters' base of operations from intruders while the characters are off adventuring. Or the ally might complete tedious side quests for the characters, gather valuable loot or information, or resolve old problems the characters have forgotten about or left behind.": "考虑盟友在幕后如何帮助角色。盟友可以在角色外出冒险时保卫角色的行动基地免受入侵者的侵害。或者盟友可以完成繁琐的支线任务，收集有价值的战利品或信息，或解决角色已经忘记或搁置的旧问题。",
	"{@creature Deck Defender|BMT|Deck defenders} are Constructs made of large, intricately folded playing cards. You can use a deck defender when a character draws the Knight card, substituting the defender for the friendly ally the card usually summons.": "{@creature Deck Defender|BMT|Deck defenders}是由大量精心折叠的扑克牌制成的构造物。当角色抽到骑士牌时，你可以使用一张牌堆防御者，将其替换为通常召唤的友好盟友。",
	"Created from the multifaceted magic of a {@item Deck of Many Things}, a deck defender obeys the commands of the character who drew the Knight card. It can assume multiple shapes. When summoned, a deck defender first appears in its protective guardian form, bearing a folded sword and shield. The character who summoned the deck defender can fold it into the more threatening berserker form or the nimble acrobat form, as desired.": "由{@item Deck of Many Things}的多面魔法创造而成，牌组守护者服从抽到骑士牌的角色的命令。它可以呈现多种形态。当被召唤时，牌组守护者首先以其守护者形态出现，手持折叠的剑和盾牌。召唤牌组守护者的角色可以根据需要将其折叠成更具威胁性的狂战士形态或灵巧的杂技师形态。",
	"No matter what form a deck defender takes, its card-like nature makes it fragile. When a deck defender is defeated, it collapses into a pile of nonmagical cards.": "无论牌堆卫士采取何种形式，其类似卡牌的本质使其很脆弱。当牌堆卫士被打败时，它会崩溃成一堆非魔法卡牌。",
	"This chapter details the Solar Bastion, a benevolent organization that protects the multiverse from the chaos wrought by the {@item Deck of Many Things}. The chapter includes a description of the organization and a map of its headquarters. It also explores how DMs can introduce the Solar Bastion to their campaigns, and how characters might join the Solar Bastion or otherwise become entangled in the group's operations across the multiverse.": "本章详细介绍了太阳堡垒(Solar Bastion)，这是一个仁慈的组织，旨在保护多元宇宙免受{@item Deck of Many Things}带来的混乱。该章节包括对该组织的描述以及总部的地图。它还探讨了DMs如何将太阳堡垒引入他们的战役中，以及角色如何加入太阳堡垒或以其他方式卷入该组织在多元宇宙中的行动中。",
	"The Solar Bastion is an elite organization with extensive resources and a benevolent agenda. Its members style themselves as knights, though the organization doesn't grant them noble titles.": "太阳堡垒(Solar Bastion)是一个拥有丰富资源和仁慈议程的精英组织。其成员自称为骑士，尽管该组织不授予他们贵族头衔。",
	"Founded by Hilarion, a solar angel, the Solar Bastion uses the sun as its symbol. Typically, this symbol is styled to evoke the Sun card in a {@item Deck of Many Things}, reflecting both the knights' origin and their mission in the multiverse. Sometimes knights wear this symbol openly on their gear, but more often they keep a sun-shaped pin hidden under a collar or lapel or carry a nonmagical copy of the Sun card to identify their allegiance when necessary.": "由太阳天使希拉里昂创建，太阳堡垒以太阳作为其象征。通常，这个符号被设计成模仿{@item Deck of Many Things}中的太阳牌，既反映了骑士们的起源，也体现了他们在多元宇宙中的使命。有时骑士们会公开佩戴这个符号在装备上，但更常见的是他们会将一个太阳形别针藏在衣领或翻领下面，或者携带一张非魔法的太阳牌副本，以在必要时确认他们的效忠。",
	"The Solar Bastion monitors the {@item Deck of Many Things} in all its manifestations throughout the multiverse, warns and protects those who find it, and minimizes the damage it causes when found. Knights of the Solar Bastion also strive to protect people from other dangerous magic, such as cursed magic items and evil artifacts. The knights often provide aid with all sorts of magical mishaps, hauntings, and monstrous infestations.": "太阳堡垒监视着多元宇宙中所有形式的{@item Deck of Many Things}，警告并保护那些发现它的人，并在发现时尽量减少它造成的伤害。太阳堡垒骑士还努力保护人们免受其他危险魔法的侵害，比如被诅咒的魔法物品和邪恶的神器。这些骑士经常提供帮助处理各种魔法事故、鬼魂出没和怪物滋扰。",
	"The Solar Bastion has hundreds of members and a vast fortune, but its mission spans the multiverse, so its resources are constantly stretched thin; the Solar Bastion welcomes assistance from adventurers sympathetic to its goals.": "太阳堡垒有数百名成员和巨额财富，但其使命跨越多元宇宙，因此资源经常紧张；太阳堡垒欢迎对其目标表示同情的冒险者提供帮助。",
	"Most of the Solar Bastion's activity revolves around monitoring {@i Decks of Many Things}. The knights strive for the following goals in their pursuit of that effort:": "太阳堡垒(Solar Bastion)的大部分活动都围绕着监视{@i Decks of Many Things}展开。骑士们在追求这一努力时努力实现以下目标：",
	"When they find a {@item Deck of Many Things}, in the hands of hapless mortals, knights of the Solar Bastion do everything they can to warn and assist the deck's owners. They make sure the owners understand the rules of drawing cards, the wide range of possible effects, and the dangers of keeping a {@item Deck of Many Things} long enough to draw the Grim Harrow's attention (the Grim Harrow is detailed in {@book chapter 19|BMT|18}).": "当他们发现一个{@item Deck of Many Things}时，在不幸凡人手中，太阳堡垒骑士会尽一切努力警告和协助牌组的所有者。他们确保所有者理解抽牌规则、可能的广泛效果以及保留一个{@item Deck of Many Things}足够长时间以吸引格林哈罗的注意（格林哈罗在{@book chapter 19|BMT|18}中有详细描述）。",
	"When they aren't actively pursuing copies of the {@item Deck of Many Things}, knights of the Solar Bastion try to learn all they can about the origin and purpose of the cards. They know much of the deck's history (as described in {@book chapter 2|BMT|1|A Deck of Many Stories}), including multiple contradictory accounts of its creation. Sorting through the conflicting legends and determining the truth about the {@item Deck of Many Things} is a cherished goal, but not one that most members of the group have any real hope of achieving.": "当他们不在积极追寻{@item Deck of Many Things}的副本时，太阳堡垒骑士们会尽力了解关于这些牌的起源和目的。他们对这副牌的历史了如指掌（如{@book chapter 2|BMT|1|A Deck of Many Stories}所述），包括多种相互矛盾的创造传说。筛选出这些相互矛盾的传说，找出关于{@item Deck of Many Things}的真相是一个珍贵的目标，但大多数团体成员并没有真正希望实现这一目标。",
	"The Solar Bastion knows that Fey called {@creature Riffler|BMT|rifflers} (see {@book chapter 21|BMT|20|Riffler}) often manipulate events to put Decks of Many Things into the hands of mortals. Thus, one way to monitor the location of the cards is to keep track of rifflers. Knights of the Solar Bastion use divination magic to find and spy on these creatures, though the knights directly interfere only if it's clear the rifflers have a {@item Deck of Many Things} in their possession.": "太阳堡垒知道被称为{@creature Riffler|BMT|rifflers}（见{@book chapter 21|BMT|20|Riffler}）的精灵经常操纵事件，将《众多命运牌组》交到凡人手中。因此，监控卡牌位置的一种方法是跟踪洗牌者。太阳堡垒骑士使用占卜魔法来找到并监视这些生物，尽管只有在明确洗牌者拥有{@item Deck of Many Things}时，骑士才会直接干预。",
	"The Solar Bastion is on the lookout for the Grim Harrow: Undead that pursue Decks of Many Things across the multiverse (see {@book chapter 19|BMT|18}). Knights of the Solar Bastion try to reach those who come into possession of a deck before the Grim Harrow does, to warn them of the threat the Undead present. They also sometimes take action against the Grim Harrow, but they know they're no match for the leaders of that organization.": "太阳堡垒骑士团正在寻找严酷的死亡镰刀：跨越多元宇宙追逐《众多命运之牌》的不死生物（见{@book chapter 19|BMT|18}）。太阳堡垒的骑士们努力在严酷的死亡镰刀之前联系到那些拥有命运之牌的人，警告他们不死生物所带来的威胁。他们有时也会采取行动对抗严酷的死亡镰刀，但他们知道他们并不是那个组织的领导者的对手。",
	"Hilarion, the Solar Bastion's leader, encountered {@creature Asteria|BMT} (see {@book chapter 22|BMT|21|Asteria}) once when she infiltrated the organization's headquarters, and the angel managed to learn some of what {@creature Asteria|BMT} knows about the deck's origins. Convinced that she is key to learning the truth about the deck, the organization seeks {@creature Asteria|BMT} across the multiverse.": "太阳堡垒的领袖希拉里昂，在她潜入组织总部时曾遇到{@creature Asteria|BMT} (见{@book chapter 22|BMT|21|Asteria})，并成功从这位天使那里了解到一些关于牌组起源的信息。相信她是了解真相的关键，该组织正在跨越多元宇宙寻找{@creature Asteria|BMT}。",
	"As a rule, knights of the Solar Bastion don't use force to wrest Decks of Many Things from those who possess them. However, they may break this rule if they discern that a deck's owner plans to use it for an evil or destructive purpose. In particular, they oppose the efforts of the Heralds of the Comet (described in {@book chapter 12|BMT|11}), who seek to use the original {@item Deck of Many Things} to destroy the multiverse.": "作为太阳堡垒骑士的惯例，他们不会使用武力夺取那些拥有众多命运牌组的人手中的牌组。然而，如果他们发现牌组的拥有者计划将其用于邪恶或破坏性目的，他们可能会打破这个规则。特别是，他们反对彗星传令者（在{@book chapter 12|BMT|11}中描述）的努力，后者试图使用原始{@item Deck of Many Things}来摧毁多元宇宙。",
	"{@i Decks of Many Things} are notoriously resistant to divination magic that would reveal their locations, so knights travel widely in pursuit of even faint leads. Inevitably, many of these leads turn out to be the effects of curses and corrupt magic. Rather than ignore these situations, knights endeavor to protect those affected by curses, destroy cursed magic items, and contain evil and destructive artifacts so they can't cause further harm or be used for wicked ends.": "{@i Decks of Many Things} 以出了名的抵抗占卜魔法而闻名，这些魔法会揭示它们的位置，因此骑士们会广泛地旅行，追寻即使是微弱线索。不可避免地，许多线索最终被证明是诅咒和腐化魔法的影响。骑士们不会忽视这些情况，他们努力保护受诅咒影响的人们，摧毁被诅咒的魔法物品，并封印邪恶和破坏性的神器，以防止它们继续造成伤害或被用于邪恶目的。",
	"The Solar Bastion's headquarters has a vault that holds at least one evil artifact the organization was unable to destroy, hiding it so it can't be put to evil use (which artifact this might be is up to you). Knowledge of the vault's location and contents is restricted to Hilarion, the Solar Bastion's leader.": "太阳堡垒总部设有一个保险库，至少藏有一个邪恶的神器，该组织无法摧毁，将其隐藏起来，以防止被用于邪恶目的（这个神器可能是什么由你决定）。对保险库的位置和内容的了解仅限于太阳堡垒的领袖希拉里昂(Hilarion)。",
	"Knights of the Solar Bastion are battle-hardened veterans who operate independently across the multiverse. When word reaches the organization that a {@item Deck of Many Things} has appeared, the nearest knight investigates, but every knight has the magical means to contact the Solar Bastion's headquarters and request help. Even so, it's rare for knights to work together outside their headquarters.": "太阳堡垒骑士是经验丰富的老兵，他们在多元宇宙中独立行动。当组织得知有一个{@item Deck of Many Things}出现时，最近的骑士会进行调查，但每个骑士都有魔法手段联系太阳堡垒总部并请求帮助。即便如此，骑士们很少在总部之外一起行动。",
	"As they travel across the multiverse, knights of the Solar Bastion frequently encounter other individuals whose goals and interests align with their own. These encounters offer opportunities for adventurers to become involved with the work of the Solar Bastion or even become knights themselves.": "当太阳堡垒的骑士们穿越多元宇宙时，经常会遇到其他个体，他们的目标和兴趣与自己的相吻合。这些相遇为冒险者提供了机会，让他们参与太阳堡垒的工作，甚至成为骑士本身。",
	"Because the knights' resources are spread thin, the Solar Bastion welcomes assistance. A knight might recruit help for a mission that's too difficult to handle alone, but more often a knight opportunistically joins forces with adventurers, offering help with the party's efforts as long as their goals align. Often, the adventurers in these arrangements have no knowledge of the knight's true allegiance, and the knight rarely explains the Solar Bastion's purpose unless that information is relevant.": "由于骑士们的资源分散，太阳堡垒欢迎援助。一名骑士可能会为一项太过艰难无法独自完成的任务招募帮手，但更常见的是骑士会机会主义地与冒险者们联手，只要他们的目标一致，就会帮助团队的努力。在这些安排中，冒险者们通常不了解骑士的真实效忠，而骑士也很少解释太阳堡垒的目的，除非这些信息是相关的。",
	"Characters who prove themselves competent and good-hearted might earn an invitation to become knights themselves. If the characters express interest, the knight brings them to the Solar Bastion headquarters. The only requirement for becoming a knight is swearing an oath to the knights' leader, promising to uphold the organization's goals.": "那些证明自己能干且善良的角色可能会受邀成为骑士。如果角色表示有兴趣，骑士会带他们去太阳堡垒总部。成为骑士的唯一要求是向骑士团领袖宣誓效忠，承诺维护组织的目标。",
	"Occasionally, knights of the Solar Bastion take in orphaned children and people in similarly desperate situations. These people might become squires to the knights, accompanying them on adventures and learning the order's ways, although Hilarion discourages this practice, preferring to see such folk returned to stable circumstances. Squires who prove their worth can count on being accepted as knights.": "偶尔，太阳堡垒的骑士们会收留孤儿和处境类似绝望的人。这些人可能会成为骑士的侍从，随同他们冒险并学习该组织的方式，尽管希拉里昂不赞成这种做法，更希望看到这些人回归稳定的生活。证明自己价值的侍从有望被接纳为骑士。",
	"In addition to the knights who actively pursue the goals of the Solar Bastion, the order's eponymous headquarters is staffed with a variety of scholars, researchers, diviners, and retired knights who train active members.": "除了那些积极追求太阳堡垒目标的骑士外，该组织名字来源的总部还有各种学者、研究人员、占卜者和退休骑士，他们负责培训现役成员。",
	"The founder and sole leader of the Solar Bastion is a neutral good {@creature solar} angel named Hilarion. Hilarion was once the trusted lieutenant of a lawful good deity, and when a mighty cleric of that deity drew the Void card from a {@item Deck of Many Things}, Hilarion led the effort to retrieve and restore the cleric's soul. The quest proved so harrowing that Hilarion's faith eroded, and when the quest was complete, the angel chose to establish the Solar Bastion rather than return to his god's service.": "太阳堡垒的创始人和唯一领袖是一位中立善良的{@creature solar} 天使，名叫希拉里昂 (Hilarion)。希拉里昂曾是一位守序善良神的亲信副手，当那位神的一位强大的神职人员从一副{@item Deck of Many Things} 中抽出虚空牌时，希拉里昂带领大家努力寻回并恢复了神职人员的灵魂。这个任务如此艰巨，以至于希拉里昂的信仰开始动摇，当任务完成时，这位天使选择建立太阳堡垒，而不是回到他神的服务中。",
	"A powerful and immortal Celestial, Hilarion sees no reason for additional tiers of leadership in the organization. All members of the Solar Bastion report directly to him, and the knights are largely self-directed in choosing missions. Hilarion and the rest of the organization represent a pool of resources knights can draw upon during their missions, rather than a top-down leadership structure. In Hilarion's view, the goals of the organization are most important, not personal loyalty to him or obeying his rules.": "作为一位强大而不朽的天神，希拉里昂认为组织中不需要额外的领导层。太阳堡垒的所有成员都直接向他汇报，骑士们在选择任务时基本上是自主的。希拉里昂和组织的其他成员代表了骑士们在执行任务时可以借助的资源池，而不是一个自上而下的领导结构。在希拉里昂看来，组织的目标最重要，而不是对他个人的忠诚或服从他的规则。",
	"That said, the knights of the Solar Bastion recognize the value of wisdom and experience. They respect the oldest knights' authority, whether those knights are active or retirees who serve as trainers in the citadel. No formal hierarchy confers authority on these knight-elders, but in practice they wield significant influence over less experienced knights.": "话虽如此，太阳堡垒的骑士们认识到智慧和经验的价值。他们尊重最年长骑士的权威，无论这些骑士是活跃的还是已经退休在城堡中担任教练。没有正式的等级制度赋予这些骑士长者权威，但实际上他们对经验不足的骑士们具有重要影响力。",
	"The {@creature Solar Bastion knight|BMT} presented here is an example member of the organization.": "这里呈现的{@creature Solar Bastion knight|BMT}是该组织的一个成员示例。",
	"Customize this stat block to suit individual knights and differentiate them from each other. For example, knights who track the Grim Harrow through the multiverse might resemble rangers instead of paladins.": "根据个体骑士的特点，定制这个属性块，使它们彼此之间有所区别。例如，追踪《Grim Harrow》穿越多元宇宙的骑士可能更像游侠而不是圣骑士。",
	"In addition, {@book Sir Jared|BMT|9|Sir Jared}, detailed at the end of the chapter, can serve as a model for knights with a lower challenge rating.": "另外，{@book Sir Jared|BMT|9|Sir Jared}，在章节末尾详细描述，可以作为具有较低挑战等级的骑士的模板。",
	"The Solar Bastion's eponymous headquarters is a fortified town built on a metal disk that orbits close to a small sun in a little-known reach of the Material Plane. The face of the disk on which the Solar Bastion is built faces the sun, so the sun is always high in the sky above it.": "太阳堡垒的名义总部是建在一个金属盘上的设防小镇，该金属盘围绕着物质位面中鲜为人知的一个小太阳轨道运行。太阳堡垒建立的金属盘的表面朝向太阳，因此太阳始终高悬在它的上空。",
	"Map 10.1 shows the major features of the Solar Bastion, including the following locations.": "地图10.1显示了太阳堡垒的主要特征，包括以下位置。",
	"Hilarion's residence is a gleaming white dome that suggests both a lofty temple and a majestic palace in its architecture and furnishings. Sun shines through a circular window in the top of the dome, and Hilarion can usually be found seated on a throne beneath that shaft of sunlight.": "希拉里昂的住所是一个闪闪发光的白色圆顶，其建筑和陈设既暗示着高耸的神庙，又暗示着雄伟的宫殿。太阳透过圆顶顶部的窗户照射进来，希拉里昂通常坐在那束阳光下的王座上。",
	"A permanent teleportation circle is inscribed in the floor before the throne, allowing anyone who knows the circle's sigil sequence and the {@spell Teleport} or {@spell Teleportation Circle} spell to teleport directly to the dome. The throne also allows anyone seated on it to cast the {@spell Sending} spell using the throne. Hilarion uses this feature to communicate with knights across the multiverse, but the angel allows knights or even some visitors to use this magic.": "在王座前的地板上刻有一个永久传送阵，允许任何知道阵法符号序列和{@spell Teleport}或{@spell Teleportation Circle}法术的人直接传送到圆顶。王座还允许任何坐在上面的人使用{@spell Sending}法术。Hilarion利用这个功能与跨越多元宇宙的骑士进行交流，但这位天使也允许骑士甚至一些访客使用这种魔法。",
	"The Dome of the Sun is said to have a hidden vault beneath it. One or more evil artifacts are rumored to be stashed in this vault to keep them from being used for malevolent ends. It's generally believed that Hilarion is the only being who knows how to access the vault, but knights of the Solar Bastion suspect traps, other angels, or perhaps heavenly Constructs protect the vault as well.": "据说太阳圆顶下面有一个隐藏的地窖。传言中，一个或多个邪恶的神器被藏在这个地窖里，以防止它们被用于邪恶目的。一般认为只有希拉里昂知道如何进入地窖，但太阳堡垒的骑士们怀疑地窖也可能受到陷阱、其他天使或天界构造的保护。",
	"Seven tall watchtowers ring the edge of the Solar Bastion. In addition to offering a clear view of the entire fortress, the towers are equipped with magical devices that give their sentries the ability to detect threats approaching the bastion and even to peer into other planes of existence. Knights of the Solar Bastion usually stay in one of the Towers of Day while visiting the fortress, and while they're there, they also serve as sentries. Each tower typically holds at most a few such visiting sentries as well as a captain, usually an older knight retired from field duty who resides there permanently. Over time, the captains have customized their towers to suit their personal hobbies and research interests.": "太阳堡垒的边缘环绕着七座高大的瞭望塔。除了能够清晰地俯瞰整个堡垒外，这些塔还配备了魔法装置，使守卫们能够探测到靠近堡垒的威胁，甚至能窥视其他存在平面。太阳堡垒的骑士们通常在访问堡垒时住在白昼之塔中，并在那里充当守卫。每座塔通常最多容纳几名这样的访问守卫以及一名队长，通常是一名从战场退役的老骑士，永久居住在那里。随着时间的推移，这些队长们已经定制了他们的塔，以适应他们个人的爱好和研究兴趣。",
	"The tower nearest the Dome of the Sun is imbued with magic that makes it serve as a sort of north pole for the fortress. Compasses point toward that tower, giving those in the bastion a common reference for cardinal directions.": "太阳圆顶(Dome of the Sun)附近的塔楼被注入了魔法，使其成为堡垒的一种北极，指南针指向那座塔楼，为堡垒中的人们提供了一个共同的基准，用于确定基本方向。",
	"A docking area in the southeast part of the Solar Bastion offers a place for spacefaring spelljamming vessels to moor (see {@book Spelljammer: Adventures in Space|AAG} for more information about travel through space). Hilarion keeps a {@vehicle wasp ship|AAG}—a lightweight spelljamming vessel that can be crewed by as few as five sailors—in the harbor, but there's room for a few more vessels depending on their size. Knights sometimes borrow Hilarion's vessel to pursue rumors concerning a {@item Deck of Many Things} when teleportation isn't a safe option. Knights who have spelljamming vessels of their own also dock them here when visiting the Solar Bastion, but the docks are seldom full.": "太阳堡垒东南部的停靠区为太空航行的魔法船提供了一个停靠的地方（有关太空旅行的更多信息请参见{@book Spelljammer: Adventures in Space|AAG}）。希拉里昂在港口停靠着一艘{@vehicle wasp ship|AAG}—一艘轻型的魔法船，只需五名水手即可组成船员—但根据船只的大小，还可以容纳几艘船。骑士们有时会借用希拉里昂的船追踪有关{@item Deck of Many Things}的传闻，当传送术不安全时。拥有自己魔法船的骑士们在访问太阳堡垒时也会将它们停靠在这里，但码头很少会满员。",
	"In the center of the Solar Bastion is a large training yard where visiting knights hone their combat and magical skills. They mostly fight against each other under the watchful eyes of retired knights, but occasionally a knight brings a particularly horrific monster—typically a powerful evil Undead or Aberration—to the fortress so knights can work together to learn how to defeat it.": "在太阳堡垒的中心是一个大型训练场，访问的骑士们在那里磨练他们的战斗和魔法技能。他们大多会在退役骑士的注视下互相对抗，但偶尔会有骑士带来一个特别可怕的怪物——通常是一个强大的邪恶不死生物或畸变生物——到堡垒，以便骑士们共同努力学习如何击败它。",
	"Across the Solar Bastion from the Dome of the Sun, the graceful spire of the Library Tower rises higher than the Towers of Day. Inside the library, a ramp winds up from the ground floor through vast ranks of shelves holding tomes, scrolls, and other repositories of learning. Scribes and scholars tend the place, sorting and indexing the volumes while making copies of particularly valuable resources. A tremendous amount of lore concerning {@i Decks of Many Things} is stored in this tower, much of it annotated by scholars attempting to sift fact from legend.": "在太阳圆顶对面的太阳堡垒，图书馆塔的优雅尖顶高于白昼之塔。在图书馆内，一条斜坡从底层蜿蜒而上，穿过摆满典籍、卷轴和其他学识宝库的书架。文书和学者们在这里工作，整理和索引着这些卷轴，同时复制特别有价值的资源。这座塔中储存着大量关于{@i Decks of Many Things}的知识，其中许多被学者们注释，试图从传说中筛选出事实。",

	"The characters find a small sculpture that radiates magic. Further investigation reveals the sculpture contains the soul of a person who drew the Void card from a {@item Deck of Many Things}.

	"The Moonstalker guildhall is in a large city, but enchanted doors in the guildhall access other settlements during different phases of the moon.

	"At the guild's inception, the Moonstalkers had three bosses: Delour, a halfling wererat; Augustus, a human werewolf; and Pyrite, a dwarf wereboar. Delour was excommunicated from a local gang for attempting to usurp leadership. When he encountered Augustus and Pyrite, similarly lost and alone, he took them in.": "在公会成立之初，月行者(Moonstalkers)有三位首领：Delour，一名半身人狼人鼠人; Augustus，一名人类狼人; 以及Pyrite，一名矮人野猪人。Delour曾因试图篡夺领导权而被当地一个帮派逐出。当他遇到同样孤独失落的Augustus和Pyrite时，他收留了他们。",

	"Less than a year after the guild's establishment, local officials uncovered the Moonstalkers. Many Moonstalkers died in the resulting battle, and Pyrite was disintegrated. Delour and Augustus fled with the survivors to a larger city and started anew. They've keep a low profile and have successfully rebuilt the organization stronger than before.": "在公会成立不到一年后，当地官员揭露了（Moonstalkers）（月行者）。许多（Moonstalkers）在随后的战斗中丧生，（Pyrite）被击溃。（Delour）和（Augustus）带着幸存者逃往一个更大的城市，并重新开始。他们保持低调，成功地重建了比以前更强大的组织。",
	"Gold motivates the Moonstalkers to perform morally bankrupt work that others won't do. Delour is eager to expand into protection rackets, gambling rings, extortion, kidnapping, arson, and murder for hire. Augustus isn't opposed to this, but he's preoccupied with personal matters.": "黄金激励着月行者们去做一些道德败坏的工作，其他人不愿意做的。德洛尔渴望扩展到保护费、赌博团伙、敲诈勒索、绑架、纵火和雇凶杀人。奥古斯都不反对这样做，但他正忙于个人事务。",
	"Both bosses agree the Moonstalkers need to bolster their ranks with powerful lycanthropes in case they're discovered and raided again, and so they can seek revenge on the officials who raided their old guildhall.": "两位老板都同意，月行者们需要加强自己的队伍，用强大的狼人来防备再次被发现和袭击，以便他们可以向袭击他们旧公会大厅的官员们寻求报复。",
	"Here are some of the Moonstalkers' most powerful and respected members.": "这里是月行者中一些最强大和受尊敬的成员。",
	"{@creature Boss Augustus|BMT|Augustus} is a hulking human werewolf of few words. He shares leadership of the guild with Boss Delour and has a knack for planning heists. Guild members consider him a brutal but fair leader. Some perceptive guild members—like Kathra Bitterwind—have noticed he's become more reclusive recently, and when he does appear, he's restless.": "{@creature Boss Augustus|BMT|Augustus}是一个高大的人类狼人，话不多。他与老板德洛尔共同领导着公会，并擅长策划抢劫。公会成员认为他是一个残酷但公正的领袖。一些敏锐的公会成员，比如卡斯拉·碧风，已经注意到他最近变得更加隐秘，而且当他出现时，显得不安。",
	"Augustus is a natural-born lycanthrope, born to {@creature werewolf} parents. His parents were slain by monster hunters when he was young, and he traveled from town to town for most of his life, fleeing whenever townsfolk discovered his true nature.": "奥古斯都是一个天生的狼人，出生于{@creature werewolf}父母。他的父母在他年幼时被怪物猎人杀害，他在大部分生命中都在城镇间流浪，每当镇民发现他真正的本性时，他就会逃离。",
	"Delour and Pyrite accepted Augustus in a way he'd never experienced before. When the three of them created the Moonstalkers guild, Augustus relished his new life of crime. But over time, his passion has faded. The riches they gathered mean nothing to him now. The violence grates on him, and he no longer empathizes with Delour's fantasies of revenge. Instead, Augustus secretly longs to end his curse and integrate into society.": "Delour（德洛尔）和Pyrite（派瑞特）以一种他以前从未经历过的方式接受了Augustus（奥古斯塔斯）。当他们三人创建了月影行会(Moonstalkers guild)时，Augustus（奥古斯塔斯）沉浸在他新的犯罪生活中。但随着时间的推移，他的激情逐渐消退。他们积累的财富现在对他毫无意义。暴力让他感到烦躁，他不再与Delour（德洛尔）对复仇幻想产生共鸣。相反，Augustus（奥古斯塔斯）暗自渴望结束他的诅咒，融入社会。",
	"Only a {@spell Wish} spell can end Augustus's curse. He has ordered Wanewort, a {@creature night hag}, to find anyone with access to that spell and plans to offer anything in his power in exchange for undoing his curse. And if bargaining doesn't work, there's always blackmail. (See the \"{@book Using the Moonstalkers in Your Campaign|BMT|10|Using the Moonstalkers in Your Campaign}\" section later in this chapter for more details.)": "只有一种{@spell Wish}咒语才能解除奥古斯都的诅咒。他命令了瓦尼沃特，一名{@creature night hag}，去寻找任何能施展那个咒语的人，并计划提供他一切能力范围内的东西来解除他的诅咒。如果讨价还价不奏效，总还有勒索。 （更多详情请参见本章后面的“{@book Using the Moonstalkers in Your Campaign|BMT|10|Using the Moonstalkers in Your Campaign}”部分。）",
	"{@creature Boss Delour|BMT|Delour} the wererat is a sly trickster and consummate thief who rules the Moonstalkers alongside his friend Augustus. Delour's honeyed words and calculating mind make him dangerous. He can smile and shake someone's hand while simultaneously plotting to ruin that person.": "{@creature Boss Delour|BMT|Delour} 这只狼人鼠是一个狡猾的骗子和精湛的小偷，他与他的朋友奥古斯都一起统治着月影猎手。德洛尔那甜言蜜语和精明的头脑使他变得危险。他可以微笑着和某人握手，同时密谋着毁掉那个人。",
	"Expanding the guild's activities beyond thievery was Delour's idea. He studies other criminal syndicates and their methods of getting rich. He considers protection rackets, smuggling, and arson to be low-hanging fruit, with extortion, kidnapping, and murder for hire being more complex challenges the guild can take on as it grows in power. His only real fear is exposure; the bigger and more active the Moonstalkers become, the more likely they are to attract the attention of law enforcement or adventurous do-gooders. The sting of the guild's flight from its first home is still fresh in Delour's mind.": "将公会的活动扩展到除了盗窃之外是 Delour 的主意。他研究其他犯罪集团及其获取财富的方法。他认为敲诈勒索、走私和纵火是易如反掌的目标，而勒索、绑架和雇凶杀人则是公会在壮大实力后可以承担的更复杂挑战。他唯一真正害怕的是曝光；月行者公会变得越来越庞大和活跃，就越有可能吸引执法部门或冒险的好心人的注意。公会从第一个家园逃离的痛苦仍然深深印在 Delour 的脑海中。",
	"Indeed, Delour never forgets a slight. He is obsessed with getting revenge on the officials who raided the original guildhall and killed Pyrite, who was like a brother to Delour. Though Delour is perfectly willing to backstab most people, he treats Augustus with utmost respect. If he discovers Augustus's plot to become human and leave the Moonstalkers, he would consider it the ultimate betrayal.": "事实上，德洛尔（Delour）从不会忘记一点点的冒犯。他痴迷于报复那些突袭原公会大厅并杀死了像兄弟一样的派瑞特（Pyrite）的官员们。尽管德洛尔完全愿意背后捅刀子，但他对奥古斯塔斯（Augustus）表现出极大的尊重。如果他发现奥古斯塔斯计划变成人类并离开月影行者（Moonstalkers）的阴谋，他会认为这是最终的背叛。",
	"The human {@creature werevulture|BMT} Kathra Bitterwind (see {@book chapter 21|BMT|20|Werevulture} for the werevulture stat block) is the trusted lieutenant of both Boss Augustus and Boss Delour. Unlike most members, Kathra was already a lycanthrope when she joined the guild, and she quickly clawed her way to the top by proving her unwavering loyalty to its leaders.": "{@creature werevulture|BMT} 人类 Kathra Bitterwind（查看 {@book chapter 21|BMT|20|Werevulture} 了解鬼鹫人形态数据表）是奥古斯塔斯老板和德洛尔老板的得力副手。与大多数成员不同，Kathra 加入公会时已经是一名狼人，通过向领导者证明她的忠诚迅速攀升到了高层。",
	"Since the bosses spend most of their time at the Moonstalkers' guildhall, plotting and negotiating with powerful clients, most guild members spend far more time with Kathra than they do with either Delour or Augustus. She trains members and leads high-priority assignments, always expecting her accomplices to deliver the same professional precision she does. She has a short temper and no patience for new recruits, but she rarely loses her cool when it counts.": "由于老板们大部分时间都在月行者公会大厅里，与强大的客户密谋和谈判，大多数公会成员与卡斯拉(Kathra)相处的时间比与德洛尔(Delour)或奥古斯都斯(Augustus)要多得多。她训练成员并领导高优先级任务，总是期望她的同谋能像她一样提供同样的专业精准。她脾气暴躁，对新兵没有耐心，但在关键时刻很少失去冷静。",
	"Wanewort the {@creature night hag} performs rituals that help the guild pull off its schemes. She uses divination magic to scope out locations for future heists and casts illusions that disguise Moonstalker members. Occasionally she provides a member with a {@i Hag Eye} necklace, allowing her to see what they see so she can provide real-time guidance during a mission. She reports to the bosses, but they give her ample rein to pursue her own endeavors and delegate tasks to guild members. Wanewort has special lair actions she can use while in the Moonstalkers' guildhall (see {@book area 11|BMT|10|11: Wanewort's Den}).": "{@creature night hag} Wanewort（Wanewort）执行仪式，帮助公会实施其计划。她使用占卜魔法来勘察未来抢劫的地点，并施放幻术来伪装月行者成员。偶尔，她会为成员提供{@i Hag Eye}项链，让她能看到他们所看到的，以便在任务期间提供实时指导。她向老板们汇报，但他们给予她充分的自由来追求自己的事业，并将任务委托给公会成员。Wanewort在月行者公会大厅内拥有特殊的巢穴行动（见{@book area 11|BMT|10|11: Wanewort's Den}）。",
	"Wanewort has ten {@creature Imp||imps} as companions. They spend almost all their time in the form of house cats, not out of secrecy, but because Wanewort prefers them that way. Guild members never see her without one of these cats in her arms, twining around her legs, or following in her wake. She pampers these imp-cats like spoiled children.": "Wanewort有十只{@creature Imp||imps}作为伴侣。他们几乎所有的时间都以家猫的形式出现，不是出于保密，而是因为Wanewort更喜欢它们这样。公会成员从未见过她没有一只这样的猫在她的怀里，绕着她的腿打转，或者跟在她的身后。她像宠坏孩子一样宠爱这些小恶魔猫。",
	"Augustus has asked Wanewort to find someone who can cast the {@spell Wish} spell, but he hasn't told her why. She has developed a ritual that alerts her whenever someone draws the Moon card from a {@item Deck of Many Things}, anywhere in the world. She figures this is less dangerous than contacting spellcasters powerful enough to cast the {@spell Wish} spell.": "奥古斯都已经要求Wanewort找到一个能施展{@spell Wish}咒语的人，但他还没有告诉她原因。她已经制定了一个仪式，每当世界上任何地方有人从{@item Deck of Many Things}中抽到月亮牌时，她就会收到警报。她认为这比联系足够强大以施展{@spell Wish}咒语的咒术师更安全。",
	"Most Moonstalker dealings occur in abandoned warehouses, the homes of members, or shadowy taverns. If the bosses choose to meet with a client in the guildhall, either they're looking to impress the client or they see the client as potentially dangerous and want backup in case negotiations break down. In either case, Moonstalkers usually blindfold visitors before leading them to the guildhall.": "大多数(`%num%`)月行者(`Moonstalker`)的交易发生在废弃的仓库、成员的住所或阴暗的酒馆。如果老板们选择在公会大厅(`guildhall`)与客户会面，要么是想给客户留下深刻印象，要么是他们认为客户可能很危险，希望在谈判破裂时有后援。无论哪种情况，月行者通常会在带领客人前往公会大厅之前给他们蒙上眼睛。",
	"The entrance to the guildhall is located beneath a Moonstalker-owned tavern in a large city. Moonstalkers enter a storage room through the building's back door, from which they can descend a stone staircase to the guildhall's crescent antechamber.": "公会大厅的入口位于一个大城市中一家由(`Moonstalker`)所有的酒馆下方。(`Moonstalkers`)通过建答的后门进入一个储藏室，然后他们可以沿着石楼梯下到公会大厅的新月前厅。",
	"Wanewort has also created four magical doors that connect to other cities during different phases of the moon. Each leads to a Moonstalker-owned building in that city.": "Wanewort还创造了四扇神奇的门，它们在不同月相时连接到其他城市。每扇门通往该城市中由月行者所有的建筑物。",
	"Every Moonstalker learns how to embrace and manage the bestial impulses of their lycanthropy as part of their training. Still, the full moon makes it difficult for many members to maintain self-control—and more importantly, to remain covert. For this reason, all Moonstalkers lock themselves in the guildhall on the night of the full moon. Many of the guildhall's walls sport long scratch marks from particularly restless nights.": "每个月影追踪者都学会如何拥抱和控制他们的狼人病的野兽冲动作为他们训练的一部分。然而，满月让许多成员难以保持自我控制——更重要的是，保持隐秘。因此，所有月影追踪者在满月之夜都会将自己锁在公会大厅里。许多公会大厅的墙上都有来自特别不安宁之夜的长长的抓痕。",

	"The walls to the left and right of the entrance bear small bas-reliefs of a new moon, a waning moon, a half moon, and a waxing moon. When the moon reaches one of these phases, the corresponding symbol glows and a magic door appears beneath it, linking to a matching door in a different city. The door disappears when its phase of the moon ends.": "入口左右的墙壁上镶嵌着小浮雕，分别是新月、残月、上弦月和下弦月。当月亮进入其中一个相位时，对应的符号会发光，一个魔法门会出现在其下方，连接到另一个城市中的匹配门。当月相结束时，门会消失。",
	"On the nights of full moons, when all Moonstalkers lock themselves in the guildhall, most convene in this spacious chamber.": "在满月之夜，当所有(`Moonstalkers`)都锁定自己在公会大厅时，大多数人聚集在这个宽敞的房间里。",

The characters might strike a deal with the guild to get their treasure back or infiltrate the guildhall to retrieve it.": "月行者最直接的用途是偷走角色或与他们亲近的人的东西。角色们可能会与行会达成协议，以取回他们的宝藏，或者潜入行会大厅将其夺回。",
	"Alternatively, if the characters are looking to steal something (for instance, as part of an adventure from {@adventure Keys from the Golden Vault|KftGV}), Moonstalkers might try to secure that same item for a different employer. In this case, the Moonstalkers act as rivals trying to beat the characters to the prize. This provides an incentive for characters to move quickly and not spend too much time planning or resting.": "另外，如果角色想要偷取某样东西（例如，作为来自{@adventure Keys from the Golden Vault|KftGV}的冒险的一部分），月影潜行者可能会尝试为另一位雇主保护同样的物品。在这种情况下，月影潜行者会充当竞争对手，试图在角色之前获得奖品。这会激励角色快速行动，不要花太多时间计划或休息。",
	"If your characters have access to the {@spell Wish} spell—for example, because they've drawn the Moon card from a {@item Deck of Many Things}—Boss Augustus makes them an offer they can't refuse. The characters could also be drawn into this story if a noncombatant draws the Moon card and becomes a target for the Moonstalkers.": "如果你的角色可以使用{@spell Wish}法术——例如，因为他们从{@item Deck of Many Things}中抽到了月亮牌—那么奥古斯塔斯老板会给他们一个无法拒绝的提议。如果一个非战斗人员抽到月亮牌并成为月亮潜行者的目标，角色也可能被卷入这个故事中。",
	"Wanewort's ritual tells her the name and location of anyone who draws the Moon card. She also has contacts looking for anyone who can cast the {@spell Wish} spell on their own. Once she has a target, she resorts to one of three tactics:": "Wanewort的仪式会告诉她任何抽到月亮牌的人的姓名和位置。她还有联系人在寻找能够自行施展{@spell Wish}咒语的人。一旦她锁定目标，她会采取以下三种策略之一：",
	"Wanewort scries on the character and uses her imps to spy on them. She uses the Moonstalkers' contacts to discover any unscrupulous or embarrassing activities in the character's past, then threatens to expose them.": "Wanewort（瓦尼沃特）窥探角色，并利用她的小恶魔来监视他们。她利用Moonstalkers（月行者）的联系人发现角色过去的不端或令人尴尬的活动，然后威胁要揭露这些秘密。",
	"Wanewort uses her hag magic to communicate with the character in a dream. She explains she works for a man who has many magical treasures and powerful connections, and he wants an audience with the character. She gives the character a meeting point and time, at which point one of her imp-cats leads the character to Augustus. She doesn't tell the characters about the Moonstalkers.": "Wanewort利用她的女巫魔法在梦中与角色沟通。她解释说她为一个拥有许多魔法宝物和强大关系的男人工作，他想要与角色见面。她给了角色一个见面地点和时间，然后她的一只小恶魔猫带领角色去找Augustus。她没有告诉角色有关月行者(Moonstalkers)的事情。",
	"Wanewort sends a team of Moonstalkers to kidnap the character or the party. She's more likely to attempt this with a low-level character or noncombatant who drew the Moon card than with high-level characters who can cast the {@spell Wish} spell on their own.": "Wanewort 派遣一队月行者去绑架角色或小队。她更有可能尝试绑架低级别角色或非战斗人员，而不是那些可以自己施放{@spell Wish}法术的高级别角色。",
	"If Augustus is confident he can best the characters in a fight, he meets them alone somewhere other than the guildhall. But if he needs backup, he meets them in the guildhall's audience hall, where Moonstalkers can rush in at a moment's notice.": "如果奥古斯都（Augustus）确信他能在战斗中击败这些角色，他会在公会大厅之外的某个地方单独与他们会面。但如果他需要支援，他会在公会大厅的观众大厅与他们会面，月行者（Moonstalkers）可以随时赶来。",
	"Augustus explains his condition as a natural-born werewolf and asks the character to wish for the end of his curse. He might offer them riches, magic items, or favors. He explains that wishes can go wrong; by trading their wish for concrete benefits, the character can let him shoulder the risk.": "奥古斯都解释他的状况是一种天生的狼人，并请求角色许愿结束他的诅咒。他可能会提供给他们财富、魔法物品或帮助。他解释说许愿可能会出错；通过用许愿换取实际利益，角色可以让他来承担风险。",
	"The Moonstalkers have many magic items stored within their hoards. If the character with a wish demands something Augustus doesn't have, he can order the guild to steal it. If the character refuses to trade their wish, Augustus threatens to expose the character's secrets or have the character killed.": "月行者们的宝藏中存放着许多魔法物品。如果角色使用一个愿望要求奥古斯都没有的东西，他可以命令公会去偷。如果角色拒绝交换他们的愿望，奥古斯都会威胁揭露角色的秘密或让角色被杀。(Augustus)",
	"Delour might catch wind of this plan and consider it a betrayal of the Moonstalkers, himself, and Pyrite. This could spark a violent schism within the guild or prompt Delour to secretly approach the characters and attempt to use their wish for himself—probably to resurrect Pyrite or get his long-delayed revenge.": "Delour可能会听到这个计划，并认为这是对(`Moonstalkers`)、他自己和(`Pyrite`)的背叛。这可能会在公会内引发激烈的分裂，或者促使Delour秘密接触角色，并试图利用他们的愿望——可能是为了让(`Pyrite`)复活或实现他长期以来拖延的复仇。",
	"The Moonstalkers don't always do their own dirty work. When a mission is too time-consuming, challenging, or simple, the guild assigns it to other criminals or to aspiring guild members. Even if your characters aren't evil, they might find themselves working for or alongside the Moonstalkers on an odd job. Perhaps both groups have a mutual enemy. Maybe the Moonstalkers learned the characters will be delving into a particular dungeon and ask the party to retrieve a specific piece of treasure. Perhaps the Moonstalkers extort the characters or refuse to divulge key information unless the characters do their bidding. Maybe the Moonstalkers offer so much money or such enticing magic items that the characters find collaboration hard to refuse.": "月行者不总是亲自动手。当任务太耗时、具有挑战性或者太简单时，行会会将其分配给其他罪犯或者渴望加入行会的成员。即使你的角色不邪恶，他们也可能发现自己在一次奇怪的工作中与月行者合作。也许两个团体有一个共同的敌人。也许月行者得知角色将要深入某个地牢，要求队伍取回特定的宝藏。也许月行者勒索角色，或者拒绝透露关键信息，除非角色完成他们的命令。也许月行者提供了如此多的金钱或者如此诱人的魔法物品，使得角色很难拒绝合作。",
	"Those hoping for guild membership (sometimes called \"crescents\") must complete three jobs for the Moonstalkers to be initiated into the guild. Crescents can work together, in which case the mission counts for all of them. Each job is more difficult than the last, and the final job always requires the crescent to take a life, usually the life of a guard or witness to the crime. The Moonstalkers then reward the crescent with lycanthropy, initiating them as a full member. Here are examples of missions the Moonstalkers might assign a crescent, in order of increasing difficulty:": "那些希望成为行会成员（有时被称为“新月”）的人必须为月行者完成三项任务，才能被正式接纳为行会成员。新月可以一起合作，此时任务对所有人都计算。每项任务比上一项更困难，最后一项任务总是要求新月夺取生命，通常是护卫或犯罪现场的目击者的生命。然后月行者会用狼人病毒奖赏新月，将其正式接纳为成员。以下是月行者可能分配给新月的任务示例，按难度递增的顺序：",
	"The character must steal a signet ring, holy book, or document from an important figure at a high-profile event like a speech or a gala. But the event has more guards than expected; someone tipped off the victim.": "角色必须在像演讲或晚会这样的高调活动中从重要人物那里偷取一枚家族印章戒指、圣书或文件。但是活动的保安比预期的要多；有人向受害者泄露了消息。",
	"Wanewort tasks the character with collecting an ingredient for her rituals, from either a dangerous grove or someone's garden. Identifying the substance requires skill, and it might be poisonous or spoil quickly, so the thief must hurry to deliver the goods on time.": "Wanewort让角色收集一个成分用于她的仪式，可以是从一个危险的树林或某人的花园。识别这种物质需要技巧，它可能是有毒的或容易腐烂，所以小偷必须赶紧把货物送到。",
	"The character must delve into a dungeon, a holy crypt, or a noble's treasury and steal a particular item. All sorts of monsters might lurk in such a place, from Undead to inhabitants of the Underdark, but they aren't all hostile, and the character might be able to sneak past them.": "角色必须深入地牢、圣墓或贵族宝库，并窃取特定物品。各种怪物可能潜伏在这样的地方，从不死族到地下世界的居民，但它们并非都是敌对的，角色也许可以偷偷溜过它们。",
	"An old enemy of the Moonstalkers—one of the officials that drove them from their original home—is traveling nearby. The character is ordered to ambush and capture the target. Once the official is brought to the guildhall and the bosses get a chance to gloat, the character is expected to kill the official.": "月行者(Moonstalkers)的一位老敌人——曾经驱逐他们离开原居地的官员——正在附近旅行。角色被命令伏击并捕获目标。一旦官员被带到公会大厅，领导们有机会夸耀之后，角色被期望杀死这位官员。",
	"Crescents who complete three missions are congratulated by the bosses, who then determine what type of lycanthrope the crescents will become. With a ceremonial bite from another Moonstalker, the crescents become fully initiated guild members.": "完成三项任务的新月会成员将受到老板们的祝贺，然后确定新月会成员将成为哪种狼人。通过另一名月行者的仪式性咬咬，新月会成员将成为完全入会的公会成员。",
	"A full member of the guild doesn't have to spend all their time at the guildhall, but they do need to be ready to respond to any assignments they receive. If you're looking for inspiration for Moonstalker missions, consider using heists from {@adventure Keys from the Golden Vault|KftGV}.": "公会的正式成员不必全部时间都待在公会大厅，但他们需要随时准备好应对收到的任何任务。如果你正在寻找关于月行者任务的灵感，可以考虑使用{@adventure Keys from the Golden Vault|KftGV}中的抢劫行动。",
	"The end is near!": "末日将至！",
	"This chapter details the Heralds of the Comet, an apocalyptic sect that plans to use the original {@item Deck of Many Things} to bring about the end of all things. It describes key leaders, members, and roles in the group and presents a map of the group's headquarters. A section at the end of the chapter describes celestial signs, omens, and prophecies related to the end of the world and explores how these can enliven your campaign. This chapter is intended for the Dungeon Master, though characters might have a connection to the cult as ex-members, or as friends or relatives of members.": "这一章详细介绍了彗星传令者(Heralds of the Comet)，这是一个末世教派，计划利用原始{@item Deck of Many Things}来引发世界末日。它描述了该团体的关键领袖、成员和角色，并呈现了该团体总部的地图。章节末尾的一部分描述了与世界末日有关的天象、预兆和预言，并探讨了这些如何能够激发你的冒险活动。这一章是为地下城主(Dungeon Master)准备的，尽管角色可能与该邪教有关联，可能是前成员，或是成员的朋友或亲戚。",
	"The Heralds of the Comet is a secret organization with a sinister agenda. Believing the multiverse is a flawed creation, members of this cult look forward to the end of all worlds and planes of existence. Low-ranking members anticipate a new creation, a multiverse made right in the wake of the old cosmos's destruction, but the leaders secretly believe the end really is the end; after the multiverse's destruction, only a formless void will remain.": "彗星传令者是一个秘密组织，拥有邪恶议程。相信多元宇宙是一个有缺陷的创造，该邪教的成员期待着所有世界和存在平面的终结。低级成员期待着一个新的创世，一个在旧宇宙毁灭后重新建立的多元宇宙，但领导者们秘密地相信终结真的是终结；在多元宇宙毁灭后，只会留下一个无形的虚空。",
	"The Heralds of the Comet is best suited for use as an antagonist in an adventure or a campaign. However, individual members aren't necessarily villains and might share short-term goals or friendly relationships with heroic characters. The \"{@book Adventure Hooks|BMT|11|Adventure Hooks}\" section in this chapter explores possibilities for how characters might interact with the cult.": "彗星使者适合作为冒险或战役中的反派。然而，个别成员并不一定是恶棍，他们可能与英雄角色分享短期目标或友好关系。本章中的“{@book Adventure Hooks|BMT|11|Adventure Hooks}”部分探讨了角色如何与该邪教互动的可能性。",
	"The teachings of the Heralds of the Comet are revealed only in part to aspirants and in more detail to initiates. Only the group's leaders know the full doctrine.": "彗星使者教派的教义只对志愿者逐渐揭示一部分，而对入门者则透露更详细的内容。只有该团体的领袖知晓全部教义。",

	"Suffering isn't an accident, a flaw in a divine plan, or purely the work of evil gods. It's evidence that the whole of creation is fundamentally flawed and already unraveling.": "苦难并非偶然事件，也不是神圣计划中的瑕疵，更不仅仅是邪恶神灵的作为。这是整个创世本质上存在缺陷并已经开始崩溃的证据。",
	"The destruction of the world is imminent, and people should prepare for it by severing their connections to the things of the world. This includes relationships, possessions, wealth, and worship of the gods, who are doomed to be destroyed alongside mortals.": "世界的毁灭已经迫在眉睫，人们应该通过切断与世俗事物的联系来做好准备。这包括人际关系、财产、财富以及对神祇（(gods)）的崇拜，因为他们注定会与凡人一起被毁灭。",

	"Those who undergo a rite of initiation, which includes a solemn oath of secrecy, learn deeper truths that build upon the basic tenets of the group:": "那些接受入会仪式的人，其中包括庄严的保密誓言，会学习更深层次的真理，这些真理是建立在该组织的基本原则之上的：",
	"The souls of mortal beings have always existed and aren't part of the flawed creation that is passing away. Souls dwelled in the Void before the creation of the multiverse, but now they are imprisoned within the multiverse.

	"Those who don't accept the teachings of the Heralds of the Comet are doomed to destruction, and they deserve pity. Initiates are taught to warn outsiders to ready themselves for the coming destruction. Many initiates are fundamentally kindhearted and try to help outsiders when they can, but they ultimately come to believe most outsiders are lost causes, too attached to the world as it is.": "那些不接受(彗星使者)Heralds of the Comet的教导的人注定要被毁灭，他们值得怜悯。新信徒被教导要警告外人准备迎接即将到来的毁灭。许多新信徒本质上是善良的，尽力在能帮助外人时帮助他们，但最终他们相信大多数外人是无可救药的，太过于执着于现状。",

	"The magic contained within the cards of the original {@item Deck of Many Things} is key to the destruction of the multiverse. Performing a reading with this {@item Deck of Many Things} won't simply reveal the future; it will determine the future, setting a date for the arrival of the All-Consuming Star.

	"The Heralds of the Comet is a small, close-knit community. Through the process of severing their ties to the doomed world, members become entirely dependent on the group and its leaders for social interaction, material support, and the fulfillment of spiritual needs. The core tenet held by initiates—that they alone are destined to survive the apocalyptic end of all things and populate the new creation—creates a worldview where all that matters is the Heralds of the Comet.": "彗星使者（The Heralds of the Comet）是一个小而紧密的社区。通过切断与注定要毁灭的世界的联系的过程，成员们变得完全依赖于团体及其领导人提供社交互动、物质支持和满足精神需求。新入门者坚信的核心信条——他们是唯一注定幸存于世界末日并繁衍新世界的人——塑造了一个世界观，其中唯一重要的是彗星使者。",
	"The Heralds of the Comet seeks recruits to swell the group's ranks. Initiates believe they have a moral imperative to rescue as many people as possible from the coming destruction of the multiverse, so they see recruitment as an act of mercy.

When an omen appears (see the \"{@book Omens of Apocalypse|BMT|11|Omens of Apocalypse}\" section at the end of this chapter), the hierophants bring the aspirants deemed ready to a sanctum for initiation (see the \"{@book Sanctum of the Heralds|BMT|11|Sanctums of the Heralds}\" section).": "彗星传令者每年进行一到两次入会仪式，具体次数取决于有意加入者的可用性以及适当的厄运征兆的出现。当征兆出现时（请参阅本章末尾的“{@book Omens of Apocalypse|BMT|11|Omens of Apocalypse}”部分），神官们会将被认为已经准备好的入会者带到一个圣所进行入会仪式（请参阅“{@book Sanctum of the Heralds|BMT|11|Sanctums of the Heralds}”部分）。",
	"The rite takes place overnight. The aspirants, who are sleep deprived, hungry, and thirsty, are led through a series of experiences that narrate the group's version of the history of the multiverse, featuring imagery drawn from the cards of a {@item Deck of Many Things}. Through the course of this narrative, the initiates learn more of the group's secret teachings and the symbolism used in divinatory card readings. At the rite's conclusion, the initiates receive a vision of the All-Consuming Star.": "这个仪式持续一整夜。那些志愿者们，他们饥渴且缺乏睡眠，将被引导经历一系列体验，讲述了多元宇宙历史的团体版本，其中的意象取自一副{@item Deck of Many Things}的牌。在这个叙述过程中，新入会者们会了解更多团体的秘传教义以及在占卜牌阅读中使用的象征意义。在仪式结束时，新入会者们会接收到一个“全能之星”的幻象。",
	"As part of this initiation, new members of the Heralds of the Comet shed their old identities and take on new names. Initiates also donate all their possessions to the group, which uses its accumulated wealth to provide for the basic needs of its initiates, and they take solemn vows of secrecy that prohibit them from discussing their initiation rite or disclosing the arcana of the group to outsiders. In the symbolism of the {@item Deck of Many Things}, initiates are sometimes called Knights.": "作为入会仪式的一部分，彗星传令者(Heralds of the Comet)的新成员摒弃旧身份并换取新名字。新成员还会将所有财产捐赠给团体，团体会利用积累的财富来满足成员的基本需求，并且他们会宣誓保守秘密，禁止讨论他们的入会仪式或向外人透露团体的奥秘。在{@item Deck of Many Things}的象征中，新成员有时被称为骑士(Knights)。",
	"Initiates who participate in the rites together speak of themselves as a single \"brood\" and remain especially close-knit. This brood is the only family that remains to initiates. Broods are numbered in the group's annals, and in the formal context of rituals, an initiate might be identified by their new name and brood number: for example, \"Aphellis, Initiate of the Twenty-Sixth Brood.\"": "参与仪式的新人们一起称自己为一个“血脉”，并保持特别紧密的关系。这个血脉是新人们唯一留下的家庭。在团体的编年史中，血脉是按编号排列的，在仪式的正式场合中，一个新人可能会被他们的新名字和血脉编号识别：例如，“阿菲利斯（Aphellis）, 第二十六血脉的新人”。",
	"The leaders of the Heralds of the Comet are called hierophants—literally \"revealers of the sacred\"—because of their role in revealing the All-Consuming Star to initiates.": "彗星传令者的领袖被称为神官(hierophants)—字面意思是“神圣的启示者”，因为他们在向新成员揭示吞噬之星的角色。",
	"The archierophant of the Heralds of the Comet is Basil, the Sage of Sages, founder of the group and the architect of its belief system. While serving a forgotten king in an insignificant realm, Basil became fascinated with the original {@item Deck of Many Things}. He convinced his king to send a hero in search of it, then invited himself to the hero's expedition and betrayed her to acquire the deck. He rashly drew a card, and his soul was imprisoned in the Void. To Basil, it was a revelatory experience. He wasn't merely in the Void; he learned the truth of the Void's relationship to the fabric of creation. To this day, he remains obsessed with the {@item Deck of Many Things}, but now his obsession has a larger goal: unleashing the power of the All-Consuming Star so all creation can return to the Void.": "彗星传令者的大祭司是巴西尔 (Basil)，智者之智者，该团体的创始人和信仰体系的设计者。在为一个无足轻重的领域中一位被遗忘的国王服务时，巴西尔对原始{@item Deck of Many Things}产生了极大的兴趣。他说服国王派遣一位英雄去寻找它，然后自己加入了英雄的远征队，并背叛了她以获取这副牌组。他鲁莽地抽取了一张牌，结果他的灵魂被困在了虚空中。对巴西尔来说，这是一次启示性的经历。他不仅仅是在虚空中；他还了解到了虚空与创世之间的关系真相。直到今天，他仍然着迷于{@item Deck of Many Things}，但现在他的痴迷有了更大的目标：释放全能之星的力量，让所有创世回归虚空。",
	"The stat blocks in this chapter represent members from each level of membership.": "本章中的属性块代表了每个成员级别的成员。",
	"{@creature Aspirant of the Comet|BMT|Aspirants} aren't yet initiated into the mysteries of the Heralds of the Comet, but they are firmly in the group's clutches, both socially and metaphysically.

	"The number of {@creature Hierophant of the Comet|BMT|hierophants} is fixed at twenty-two on any one world, one for each card in a {@item Deck of Many Things}. As a group, hierophants are sometimes called Sages, but each hierophant is also identified with a particular card. When a hierophant dies, the remaining leaders choose an initiate to fill the position, preferring initiates from the oldest broods.": "在任何一个世界上，{@creature Hierophant of the Comet|BMT|hierophants} 的数量固定为二十二，每个世界有一个{@item Deck of Many Things}。作为一个团体，hierophants 有时被称为 Sages，但每个 hierophant 也与特定的一张牌联系在一起。当一个 hierophant 死去时，剩下的领袖会选择一个候补者来填补这个职位，更倾向于来自最古老的族群的候补者。",
	"A new hierophant undergoes a rite similar to the rite of initiation, but only the other hierophants are present. As the cosmic narrative unfolds, the new hierophant is inducted into the esoteric secrets of the group's leadership. The rite concludes with a mind-shattering vision of the Void, which hierophants understand to be the formless nothingness that preceded the creation of the cosmos and will endure past its destruction.": "一位新的圣职者经历了类似于入门仪式的仪式，但只有其他圣职者在场。随着宇宙叙事的展开，新的圣职者被引入到团体领导的秘传之中。仪式以对虚空的令人心智震撼的幻象结束，圣职者们理解这虚空是在宇宙创造之前形成的无形虚无，将在宇宙毁灭之后继续存在。",
	"The leaders of the Heralds of the Comet, hierophants are powerful warlocks with mighty spells at their disposal. They can commune with the alien mind of the All-Consuming Star, blast enemies with beams of eldritch energy, and conjure manifestations of this entity to devour their foes.": "彗星传令者(Heralds of the Comet)的领袖，神谕者(hierophants)是强大的术士，拥有强大的法术。他们可以与异星之心进行交流，用邪能光束轰击敌人，并召唤这个实体的化身来吞噬他们的敌人。",

	"Most meetings of the Heralds of the Comet involve broods of initiates gathering in private homes to read divinatory cards and look for signs of impending cataclysm. Rites of initiation, though, take place in sanctums: remote headquarters like the one shown in map 12.1. A sanctum is a temple, meeting place, and residence for one or more of the group's hierophants, as well as for initiates who serve as caretakers. A sanctum is typically located a few miles outside a major city, allowing the group to meet in private while still enabling the residents to get to and from the city in an hour or two.": "大彗星传令者（Heralds of the Comet）的大多数会议涉及新入门者聚集在私人住宅中阅读占卜牌，并寻找迫近的灾变迹象。然而，入门仪式却是在圣所（sanctums）中举行：像地图12.1中所示的那样，这些遥远的总部。圣所是一座寺庙、聚会场所，也是一名或多名该团体的神官的住所，同时也是担任看守的新入门者的住所。圣所通常位于大城市外几英里处，使团体能够私下会面，同时又使居民能够在一两个小时内往返于城市之间。",
	"The building shown in map 12.1 is a large house built in front of a natural cave opening, donated to the Heralds of the Comet by a wealthy aspirant. The first floor of the house includes a luxurious living room, a kitchen and spacious dining room, and a large bedroom suite on the first floor. The second floor (not shown on the map) has more bedrooms and a study.": "在地图12.1中显示的建筑是一座大房子，建在一个自然洞口前面，由一位富有的志向者捐赠给了彗星传令者。房子的第一层包括一个豪华客厅，一个厨房和宽敞的餐厅，以及一个大卧室套房。第二层（地图上未显示）有更多的卧室和一个书房。",
	"At the end of the hallway leading north to the bedroom suite, an ornate stained-glass window depicts the All-Consuming Star as it is shown on the Comet card in a {@item Deck of Many Things}. In the northwest corner of the house, an antechamber serves as a place where aspirants gather before the rite of initiation begins. Arcane imagery decorates the room's walls and pillars, and each card from a {@item Deck of Many Things} is represented in images that surround the cave entrance in the west wall.": "在通往卧室套房的走廊尽头，一扇华丽的彩色玻璃窗描绘了“全能之星”，就像在塔罗牌中的彗星牌上展示的那样。在房屋的西北角，一个前厅作为候选人在入门仪式开始前聚集的地方。神秘的图像装饰着房间的墙壁和柱子，每张塔罗牌从{@item Deck of Many Things}中的图像都围绕着西墙的洞口展示。",
	"The winding cave is mostly natural, but the cult members have widened the narrow passages and shored up the crumbling cave walls with masonry. Stalactites hang from the ceilings, but most of the stalagmites have been cleared to allow easy passage. A few natural columns remain. Two natural pools are incorporated into the initiation rite: new initiates bathe in the larger pool and then drink from the smaller pool, whose cold and bitter waters are said to make them more receptive to the vision that awaits them in the final chamber.": "这条蜿蜒的洞穴大部分是自然形成的，但邪教成员们已经扩宽了狭窄的通道，并用砖石支撑起了破损的洞壁。钟乳石悬挂在天花板上，但大部分石笋已经被清理干净，以便通行。一些自然的柱子仍然保留着。两个自然池塘被纳入了入会仪式中：新成员会在较大的池塘中沐浴，然后从较小的池塘中饮水，据说那里冰冷苦涩的水会让他们更容易接受等待他们的幻境，那就在最后的大厅里。",
	"The path through the cave descends steadily as it winds away from the entrance; the final chamber's floor is about 25 feet lower than the floor of the house. Metal disks are embedded in the wall approximately every 8 feet along the path.

	"The final chamber is off-limits to all. In the climactic moments of the initiation rite, a hierophant uses the All-Consuming Star action (see the {@creature hierophant of the comet|BMT} stat block) to fill most of the chamber with a manifestation of the ravenous entity. Those who dare enter the chamber risk being devoured when the manifestation appears.": "最终密室对所有人都是禁地。在入门仪式的高潮时刻，一位神秘人物使用吞噬之星（见{@creature hierophant of the comet|BMT}属性块）动作，将密室的大部分空间填满贪婪实体的显现。那些敢于进入密室的人冒着在实体出现时被吞噬的风险。",
	"The Heralds of the Comet offers opportunities for adventures in any campaign. As an apocalyptic sect pursuing the destruction of the multiverse, it's best suited for an antagonistic role.

	"A hierophant stirs up public sentiment against the characters in retaliation for the characters' unwanted interest in the cult's business.

Wildspace systems exist on the Astral Plane—an infinite void that surrounds all worlds of the Material Plane.": "在D&D（龙与地下城）的设定中，夜空中的大部分星星都是太阳、行星或其他遥远的物体，它们都存在于被称为(Wildspace)的真空区域中。一组相关的天体和行星物体被称为一个(Wildspace system)。这些(Wildspace system)存在于星界平面(Astral Plane)上——这是环绕物质界(Material Plane)所有世界的无限虚空。",

	"A zodiac sign is a mythological entity associated with a constellation in a zodiac. For the Sky of Many Things, a creature is said to be \"born under\" a zodiac sign if its birthday occurs during the period when that sign's constellation is most prominent in the night sky. In other zodiac traditions, a creature's \"sun sign\"—the constellation that overlapped with the sun at the time of the creature's birth—might carry more weight.": "一个星座是与黄道十二宫中的一个星座相关联的神话实体。在《众物天空》中，如果一个生物的生日恰好在该星座的星座在夜空中最为突出的时期，那么就说它是“出生在”一个星座下。在其他黄道传统中，一个生物的“太阳星座”——即在生物出生时太阳重叠的星座——可能更为重要。",

As this illustration suggests, the Key is often associated with great power in humble (or even hapless) hands.": "许多艺术家对这个星座的诠释中，展示了一个孩子手持一把银色钥匙。孩子的微笑表明着一种良善的好奇心。正如这幅插图所暗示的那样，钥匙经常被认为是在谦卑（甚至是不幸）的手中具有巨大力量的象征。",

	"Tempers and passions flare under the Flames, also known as the Lovers. The stars that form the constellation suggest embracing figures or, in more chaste circles, a pair of hands pressed palms together. In mythological stories, the Lovers are bored by the Talons and would rather make tragic deals with the Gem. When portrayed as a person, the Flames takes up with the Rogue, contributing to the belief that opposites attract.": "在《炎热》(Flames)星座下，脾气和激情都会燃烧。这个星座形成的星星暗示着拥抱的身影，或者在更为贞洁的圈子里，是一双手掌合十。在神话故事中，炎热者对着《利爪》(Talons)感到厌倦，宁愿与《宝石》(Gem)达成悲剧性的交易。当被描绘成一个人时，炎热会与《流氓》(Rogue)结伴，这也印证了异性相吸的信念。",
	"Children born under the Flames are destined to arouse strong emotions in other people—be it love or anger. They are artists, counselors, and religious figures.": "在炎之下出生的孩子注定会在其他人身上激起强烈的情绪，无论是爱还是愤怒。他们是艺术家、顾问和宗教人物。",

	"When the legendary druid {@creature Euryale|BMT} appears on the horizon, farmers sow their final late-season seeds and prepare their other fields for harvest. {@creature Euryale|BMT}'s constellation was created at the same time as the first {@item Deck of Many Things}. Artistic renditions of this constellation often show {@creature Euryale|BMT}'s hair as a tangle of snakes and wildflowers.": "当传奇德鲁伊{@creature Euryale|BMT}出现在地平线上时，农民们播下他们最后的晚季种子，并准备其他田地进行收割。{@creature Euryale|BMT}的星座是在第一个{@item Deck of Many Things}诞生的同时创造的。对这个星座的艺术描绘经常展示{@creature Euryale|BMT}的头发像一团蛇和野花。",

They pursue trades that reward shifting loyalties, such as con artists, courtiers, or politicians.": "那些出生在流氓座的人注定会被身边的人背叛，或者会首先出卖他人以自保。他们追求那些奖励变换忠诚的行业，比如骗子、宫廷侍从或政客。",

The Genie appears in countless zodiac legends, typically as the mysterious instigator of the Knight's adventure, the source of the Sage's wanderings, or the silent shadowy companion of the Jester.": "不同的文化可能会将这个星座视为钻石，红宝石或蓝宝石。精灵出现在无数的星座传说中，通常作为骑士冒险的神秘发起者，贤者漫游的源头，或小丑的沉默阴影伴侣。",

	"Many societies see the herald of winter as a dour constellation. In some folklore, the Talons is a stern grandparent of the Knight or the Flames. When one of these younger signs commits a grievous error despite ample warning, the Elder chides the youth while taking the blame. In other tales, the Elder is a usurper of the Throne and seeks to gain power by manipulating the Rogue or scheming with the Skull.": "许多社会将冬季的先驱视为一个严肃的星座。在一些民间传说中，指爪(Talons)是骑士(Knight)或火焰(Flames)的严厉祖父。当这些年轻星座中的一个犯下严重错误却有充分的警告时，长者责备年轻人同时承担责任。在其他故事中，长者是王位的篡夺者，通过操纵流浪者(Rogue)或与骷髅(Skull)密谋来获取权力。",
	"Children born under this sign are sometimes distinguished by a wrinkled brow, supposedly a mark left by the Talons themselves. These children are destined to lose everything—or to cause an equally devastating loss for another. They can be found in occupations that involve taking and hoarding, such as loan shark, smuggler, and burglar.": "据说，出生在这个星座下的孩子有时会因为皱起的眉头而被区分出来，据说这是鹰爪本身留下的标记。这些孩子注定会失去一切，或者会给他人带来同样毁灭性的损失。他们常常从事涉及获取和囤积的职业，比如放贷者、走私者和窃贼。",
	"The Jester dances atop the other zodiac members, portending the start of winter. Good cheer and wry sorrow occur in equal measure when the Nilbog is involved, and many winter holidays are celebrated under his mischievous grin.": "小丑在其他黄道十二宫成员的上方起舞，预示着冬天的开始。当涉及到尼尔博格(Nilbog)时，喜悦和讽刺的悲伤同样存在，许多冬季节日都在他调皮的笑容下庆祝。",

	"For optimal stargazing, an observatory is typically situated at a high elevation, such as a mountain peak or a coastal bluff. Astronomers prize a clear, dark sky, so many observatories are built in the wilderness. Such locations are often isolated, and the staff that work in these remote locales are famous for eccentricities born out of extended loneliness and isolation. That said, a particularly well-equipped observatory can employ magic to cut through the firelight and smoke created by a nearby settlement, enable quick travel for astronomers and supply wagons, and communicate with far-off individuals.": "为了最佳观星体验，一个天文台通常建在海拔较高的地方，比如山顶或海边悬崖。天文学家们看重晴朗幽暗的天空，因此许多天文台建在荒野之中。这样的地点通常很偏僻，那些在这些偏远地区工作的工作人员因为长时间的孤独和隔离而产生了一些古怪的特点。尽管如此，一个特别设备齐全的天文台可以利用魔法穿透附近定居点产生的火光和烟雾，为天文学家和供应马车提供快速旅行，并与遥远的个体进行沟通。",

When adventurers came to investigate the seemingly abandoned keep, Gremorly murdered them and trapped their ghosts.

It slew Gremorly, who became a victim of his own ritual.": "多年前，一个名叫格雷莫利(Gremorly)的巫师从一副{@item Deck of Many Things}中抽到了王座牌(Throne card)，获得了一座名为君主要塞(Sovereign's Keep)的小城堡的所有权。格雷莫利是一位死灵术士和厌恶人类者，对活人没有耐心；他决定利用这座城堡来创造和驻扎一个幽灵军队，以此来夺取权力。格雷莫利进行了一场仪式，将君主要塞变成了一个幽灵陷阱：在城堡墙内死去的人会以无形灵魂的形式复活，被困在城堡内。然后，他等待着。当冒险者前来调查这座看似被遗弃的城堡时，格雷莫利将他们杀害并困住了他们的幽灵。但最近，幸运之神却转向了格雷莫利，一条贝希尔(behir)进入了城堡寻找巢穴。它杀死了格雷莫利，后者成为了自己仪式的牺牲品。",
	"Gremorly is now one of the many ghosts that haunt the keep. Locals have renamed the keep Harrowhall, as they dread the spectral figures moving through the fog there and the fierce lightning storms that erupt without warning. (The behir is the source of this lightning, but the locals don't know that.)": "格雷莫利(Gremorly)现在是那座城堡中众多鬼魂之一。当地居民已经将这座城堡重新命名为哈罗霍尔(Harrowhall)，因为他们害怕在那里穿行的幽灵身影和突如其来的猛烈闪电风暴。 (这些闪电的源头是贝西尔(behir)，但当地居民并不知道。)",
	"Harrowhall is designed to be a challenge for four 8th-level characters who explore the keep in a single session. Decrease the challenge for characters lower than 8th level.

	"When the characters first arrive at Harrowhall, a thick and unsettling fog covers the grounds and many of the castle's rooms. The fog is a side effect of the ritual.

	"The ghosts all hide from Gremorly. Although they know of the necromancer and the presence of other ghosts, they have forgotten most of what they knew in life, recalling little beyond the mission that brought them to the keep.

This effect lingers even if Gremorly's ritual ghost trap is dismantled.": "在启动他的死灵计划之前，格雷莫利在城堡外墙周围放置了符文，阻挡了某些类型的占卜魔法。城堡外墙外的生物无法窥视到城堡内部。然而，城堡内部的生物可以窥视到内部或墙外。即使格雷莫利的仪式幽灵陷阱被拆除，这种效果仍然持续。",

Their unofficial leader is Tauriano, a mild-mannered professor of archaeology at a far-off university. The archaeologists are unsure how to proceed with their mission; Mekkalath is only the most obvious of many dangers. They might hire the characters as scouts or guards. While they won't fight on the characters' behalf, they might loan the use of their gorgons or help characters who've earned their trust by tricking or distracting Mekkalath, perhaps by creating a trap into which the dragon could be lured.": "这些弥诺陶洛斯考古学家并不暴力，也没有武器，但他们配备了挖掘神庙所需的工具。他们的非官方领袖是陶里亚诺(Tauriano)，一个在遥远大学担任考古学教授的温和人。考古学家们不确定如何继续他们的任务；梅卡拉斯(Mekkalath)只是众多危险中最明显的一个。他们可能会雇佣角色作为侦察员或卫士。虽然他们不会为了角色而战斗，但他们可能会借出他们的蛇发女妖或帮助那些通过欺骗或分散梅卡拉斯而赢得他们信任的角色，也许是通过制造一个可以引诱龙进入的陷阱。",

	"The group came to Gardmore Abbey to forge an alliance with Mekkalath, whose power would tip the balance in a war on the Astral Plane.

	"The southeastern side of the hill once held flourishing gardens: an idyllic refuge in an otherwise martial environment. When the abbey was destroyed, three dryads settled in the abandoned gardens. Their presence concentrated magical energy from the Feywild that transformed the gardens into a mystical faerie grove. But a generation ago, a coven of three {@creature Green Hag||green hags} snuck into the grove, slew the dryads, and took their place, using their Illusory Appearance ability to impersonate the dryads when necessary. The hags keep a pack of six {@creature Displacer Beast||displacer beasts} as hunting animals and pets (alternatively, you can use {@creature Yeth Hound|MPMM|yeth hounds} from {@book Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}).": "山丘的东南侧曾经有繁茂的花园：在一个以军事为主的环境中，这里是一个田园般的避难所。当修道院被摧毁时，三位树精定居在被遗弃的花园里。他们的存在聚集了来自精灵界的魔法能量，将花园变成了一个神秘的仙境树林。但一代人前，一群三个{@creature Green Hag||green hags}潜入树林，杀死了树精，并取而代之，利用它们的幻象外貌能力在必要时冒充树精。这些女巫养了一群六个{@creature Displacer Beast||displacer beasts} 作为狩猎动物和宠物（或者，你也可以使用{@creature Yeth Hound|MPMM|yeth hounds}来自{@book Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}）。",
	"The hags use the Feygrove as their base while pursuing bloodthirsty schemes against enemies both real and imagined.

	"In addition to the Whispering Wood, the Feygrove holds an ancient holy well called the Font of Ioun, once sacred to the knights who dwelled here. Those who drank directly from the font received visions of the past and future from this god of knowledge. Good characters who drink from the font might receive a vision; roll on the Visions of Ioun table below.": "除了低语树林，精灵林地还拥有一个古老的圣井，名为伊昂之泉，曾经是这里驻扎的骑士们所崇拜的圣地。直接饮用泉水的人会从这位知识之神那里得到过去和未来的幻象。善良的角色饮用泉水后可能会得到一个幻象；请参考下方的伊昂幻象表进行投掷。",

	"Beyond the hags, the Feygrove is home to many other dangers.

	"A bell tower once stood high on the slope above the Feygrove, but the tower has collapsed. For centuries the massive iron bell has lain in the ruins, covered with grass and barely discernible. Recently, a young {@creature displacer beast} (or {@creature displacer beast kitten|WBtW} from {@adventure The Wild Beyond the Witchlight|WBtW}) exploring the bell accidentally tipped it over and got caught inside. The creature is now trapped and howling miserably, its cries echoing and amplified by the bell into an otherworldly groan. Other displacer beasts in the grove take delight in the creature's misfortune, while the howling has attracted the notice of hungry spiders. Characters willing to free the creature might befriend it or return it to the hags for a favor.": "在费伊树林上方的斜坡上曾经矗立着一座钟楼，但是这座塔已经倒塌。几个世纪以来，这座巨大的铁钟一直躺在废墟中，被草覆盖，几乎看不清。最近，一位年轻的{@creature displacer beast}（或来自{@adventure The Wild Beyond the Witchlight|WBtW}的{@creature displacer beast kitten|WBtW}）在探索钟楼时不小心将其推倒，并被困在里面。这个生物现在被困住了，正在悲惨地嚎叫，它的哭声被钟声回荡和放大，变成了一种超自然的呻吟。树林中的其他错位兽对这个生物的不幸感到高兴，而嚎叫声吸引了饥饿的蜘蛛的注意。愿意解救这个生物的角色可能会与它交好，或者将其送回给女巫以换取一个恩惠。",
	"On the southern end of the hill stands a tall spire with a commanding view of the surrounding terrain. When Captain Nenlast drew from the {@item Deck of Many Things}, a wave of energy from the Far Realm uprooted the spire from regular space and time and transformed everyone inside into deadly Aberrations. But wards placed by the knights long before kept the Far Realm's magic confined within the tower, which became a pocket dimension with no escape. The Aberrations were trapped in the tower, unable to leave until the Far Realm energies dispersed and the tower stabilized in the present.": "在山丘的南端矗立着一座高耸的尖塔，可以俯瞰周围的地形。当Nenlast船长从{@item Deck of Many Things}中汲取力量时，来自遥远位面的能量冲击将尖塔从常规空间和时间中连根拔起，并将内部的所有人转变为致命的畸变生物。但早在此前，骑士们设置的结界将遥远位面的魔法限制在了塔内，使其成为一个没有逃脱之路的袖珍维度。这些畸变生物被困在塔内，直到遥远位面的能量散去，塔在现在稳定下来之前都无法离开。",
	"More than a century ago, adventurers investigating the abbey found a way inside the watchtower. They slew the Aberrations' beholder leader and dispelled the Far Realm magic that isolated the spire. Time once again began to affect the watchtower, though nothing remained alive within its walls.": "一个多世纪前，冒险者们调查修道院时找到了进入瞭望塔的方法。他们杀死了畸变生物的视觉领袖，并驱散了孤立尖塔的远境魔法。时间再次开始影响瞭望塔，尽管在其墙内没有任何生物存活。",
	"Recently, a fell comet streaked through the sky above the abbey. As it did, lingering traces of the Far Realm energy woke again. The dead beholder was reanimated as a diabolical Undead known as a death tyrant. This creature, and other Far Realm Aberrations that fell from the comet, still hunt within the tower. But the knights' protective magic hasn't failed entirely; the creatures within the watchtower are trapped inside until someone or something frees them.": "最近，一颗陨石划过修道院上空的天空。随着它的出现，远境能量的残留痕迹再次苏醒。死去的眼魔被复活为一种名为死亡暴君的邪恶不死生物。这种生物，以及从陨石上掉落的其他远境畸变体，仍在塔内搜寻猎物。但骑士们的保护魔法并没有完全失败；守望塔内的生物被困在里面，直到有人或某物释放它们。",
	"The watchtower is in better physical shape than the rest of the abbey. It was protected from time's ravages during the centuries it was trapped in a pocket dimension. The spire still has wooden floors and a ceiling. The circular stairs within are weakened and precarious but mostly intact. The chambers within the tower are home to four {@creature Red Slaad||red slaadi} (an equal number of {@creature Star Spawn Mangler|MPMM|star spawn manglers} from {@book Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM} might replace or supplement the slaadi). The top of the watchtower, however, is the domain of the {@creature death tyrant}.": "这座瞭望塔的物理状况比修道院的其他部分要好。在被困在一个口袋维度中的几个世纪里，它免受了时间的摧残。尖塔上仍然有木地板和天花板。塔内的圆形楼梯已经变得脆弱而不稳定，但大部分仍然完好无损。塔内的房间是四个{@creature Red Slaad||red slaadi}的家园（同样数量的{@creature Star Spawn Mangler|MPMM|star spawn manglers}可能会替换或补充斯拉迪）。然而，瞭望塔的顶部是{@creature death tyrant}的领地。",
	"None of the Aberrations within the watchtower can leave it, thanks to the ancient knights' protective spells, but characters might agree to remove these wards as part of a deal with the death tyrant. A character who is aware of the wards and able to perceive them (for example, via the {@spell Detect Magic} spell) can permanently remove them with the {@spell Dispel Magic} spell (DC 16). Alternatively, anyone can attempt to remove the wards by performing a 1-hour ritual outside the watchtower and succeeding on a DC 21 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. Removing these protective spells allows the Aberrations inside the tower to leave, something they're all eager to do. Physical damage to the watchtower—volcanic activity, for example, spreading from Mekkalath's lair—could also break the wards and release the creatures trapped within.": "在守望塔内的畸变生物无法离开，这要归功于古代骑士的保护法术，但角色们可能会同意移除这些结界，作为与死亡暴君达成协议的一部分。一个意识到这些结界并能感知它们的角色（例如，通过{@spell Detect Magic}法术）可以使用{@spell Dispel Magic}法术（DC 16）永久移除它们。另外，任何人都可以尝试在守望塔外进行一个1小时的仪式，并在DC 21智力检定（{@skill Arcana}）中成功来移除这些结界。移除这些保护法术允许塔内的畸变生物离开，他们都渴望这样做。对守望塔的物理损害——比如从梅卡拉斯的巢穴传播出来的火山活动——也可能打破结界并释放被困其中的生物。",
	"The death tyrant is desperate to escape the watchtower and promises anything to characters who reach the tower's summit. The tyrant keeps the strict letter of any promise it makes, but as it cares nothing for living creatures and respects only power, characters who try to direct it against Mekkalath might regret their decision. For example, the death tyrant might agree to attack the dragon, then start by slaying the peaceful minotaurs and turning them into its zombie minions. Mekkalath is aware of the death tyrant, and if it escapes, Mekkalath soon moves to destroy this potential rival and secure his dominance over the hill. Such a battle might last long enough for daring characters to infiltrate Dragon's Roost and abscond with treasures from Mekkalath's hoard.": "死亡暴君急于逃离守望塔，并承诺给予任何能到达塔顶的角色。暴君会严格遵守它所做的任何承诺，但由于它对生物毫不关心，只尊重力量，试图指使它对抗梅卡拉斯的角色可能会后悔自己的决定。例如，死亡暴君可能同意攻击那条龙，然后开始屠杀和将和平的牛头人变成它的僵尸手下。梅卡拉斯知道死亡暴君的存在，如果它逃脱，梅卡拉斯很快会采取行动摧毁这个潜在的竞争对手，并确保他在这片山丘上的统治地位。这场战斗可能持续足够长的时间，让大胆的角色潜入龙巢，夺走梅卡拉斯的宝藏。",
	"A death tyrant versus a red dragon? Now that's a fight I'd like to see!": "一个死亡暴君对抗一只红龙？这可是一场我想看到的战斗！",
	"(I'm joking. Please don't actually start this fight. You might perish.)": "（我在开玩笑。请不要真的开始这场战斗。你可能会灭亡。）",
	"The summit of the hill was once crowded with buildings. All but a few were destroyed in the siege of the abbey centuries ago, and the remainder were badly damaged. Mekkalath's arrival caused additional destruction: the red dragon's magic triggered volcanic activity that left the area riddled with flaming pits, rocky outcroppings, and rivers of lava. His magic also opened portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, bringing salamanders and fire elementals to the hilltop. The dragon's domain, shown in map 16.2, is the most dangerous part of the ruins by far.": "山顶曾经是密密麻麻的建筑物。除了少数几座，几个世纪前的修道院围攻中几乎所有建筑都被摧毁，剩下的也受到严重损坏。梅卡拉斯的到来导致了额外的破坏：这只红龙的魔法触发了火山活动，使该地区布满了燃烧的坑洞、岩石突出和熔岩河流。他的魔法还打开了通往火元素位面的传送门，将火蜥蜴和火元素带到山顶。龙的领地，在地图16.2中显示，是废墟中最危险的部分。",
	"A hidden stair—steep, long abandoned, and choked with rubble and undergrowth—leads up the western side of the hill. This secret staircase can be found with 1 hour of searching and a successful DC 18 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. Flying creatures can spot the staircase more easily, gaining advantage on the check. Climbing the steps requires no checks, but it takes 1 hour to clear a path and scramble over the largest chunks of rubble. Climbers risk encountering hostile creatures as they traverse the staircase, and if Mekkalath takes to the air, he's likely to spot them.": "一条隐秘的楼梯——陡峭、长时间被遗弃，被瓦砾和灌木丛淹没——沿着山丘的西侧通往上方。这个秘密楼梯可以在搜索1小时并成功通过DC 18的感知（{@skill Perception}）检定后找到。飞行生物可以更容易地发现这个楼梯，获得检定的优势。攀登这些台阶不需要检定，但需要1小时的时间来清理道路并爬过最大的瓦砾。攀登者冒着在穿越楼梯时遭遇敌对生物的风险，如果Mekkalath飞上天空，他很可能会发现它们。",
	"The stairs ascend to the Hall of Glory, formerly a lavish trophy room and memorial to fallen knights. The roof has fallen in, and the walls are mostly rubble; it is home to a troop of eight {@creature Salamander||salamanders} brought from the Elemental Plane of Fire by Mekkalath's magic. The salamanders serve Mekkalath, patrolling the hill and performing errands for him. A stairway in the back of the hall descends to the vaults but is filled with lava.": "楼梯通往荣耀大厅，曾经是一个豪华的奖杯室和纪念陨落骑士的地方。屋顶已经坍塌，墙壁大部分成了碎石；这里是由Mekkalath的魔法从火元素位面带来的八个{@creature Salamander||salamanders}的驻地。这些火蜥蜴为Mekkalath效劳，巡逻这座山丘并为他执行任务。大厅后面的楼梯通往地窖，但现在已经被熔岩填满。",
	"A ruined barrack lies on the south side of the area. Like most of the other buildings, the roof is gone and the walls are mostly rubble.

	"At the north end of the summit stands a gatehouse. The gatehouse's stone roof and walls are intact, though the massive double door has collapsed. The gatehouse is home to two {@creature Deva||devas}, angels in service to Bahamut who've guarded the abbey since its founding. They couldn't stop the siege or the Undead lured by the {@item Deck of Many Things}, but they remained in the ruins until Mekkalath rose from the vaults below and drove them out. The angels refuse to abandon their posts and are content to wait as long as it takes for Mekkalath to depart.": "在山顶的北端矗立着一座门楼。 门楼的石头屋顶和墙壁完好无损，尽管巨大的双门已经倒塌。 门楼是两位{@creature Deva||devas}天使的住所，他们是巴哈摩特的侍从，自修道院建立以来一直守护着这里。 他们无法阻止围攻或被{@item Deck of Many Things}引诱的不死生物，但他们一直留在废墟中，直到梅卡拉斯从地下的地窖中崛起并将它们赶走。 天使们拒绝离开自己的岗位，愿意等待梅卡拉斯离开，无论需要多长时间。",
	"The remains of the abbey's temple—surrounded by fires, smoke, and slow-moving lava streams—serve as Mekkalath's lair. This {@creature adult red dragon} is an awesome sight, resting on a massive pile of coins, jewels, and precious objects. From this vantage, Mekkalath can see almost anywhere on the hilltop; only the gatehouse, with its stone roof, blocks his vision. {@creature Salamander||Salamanders} from the Hall of Glory visit frequently to serve Mekkalath's every desire. When he is hungry, the dragon hunts a vast region around the hill. He has yet to encounter anyone able to stop him. A staircase in the ruined temple descends to the catacombs but is choked with rubble.": "庙宇的遗迹——被火焰、烟雾和缓慢流动的岩浆环绕——成为梅卡拉斯（Mekkalath）的巢穴。这是一个令人敬畏的景象，梅卡拉斯休息在一大堆硬币、珠宝和贵重物品上。从这个位置，梅卡拉斯几乎可以看到山顶的任何地方；只有带有石屋顶的门楼挡住了他的视线。荣耀大厅（Hall of Glory）的侍从经常前来满足梅卡拉斯的一切需求。当他饥饿时，这条龙会在山丘周围的广阔地区狩猎。迄今为止，还没有人能够阻止他。废墟中的一条楼梯通往地下墓穴，但已被瓦砾堵塞。",
	"Among Mekkalath's hoard is a {@item Deck of Many Things}. If the characters reach the hoard by defeating the dragon in battle or through stealth—perhaps while the dragon is distracted by food, the githyanki embassy, or an escaped death tyrant—the treasure should also include one rare or very rare magic item for each character, chosen to suit their needs and desires.": "在梅卡拉斯的宝藏中有一个{@item Deck of Many Things}。如果角色通过战胜龙或通过潜行达到宝藏——也许是在龙被食物、吉萨因凯大使馆或一只逃脱的死亡暴君分心时——宝藏还应包括一个稀有或非常稀有的魔法物品，每个角色一个，选择适合他们需求和欲望的物品。",
	"Two underground levels within the hill are currently inaccessible, but characters or the minotaur archaeologists might eventually reopen them.": "山丘内的两个地下层目前无法进入，但角色或弥诺陶尔考古学家可能最终会重新打开它们。",
	"The uppermost level is a winding network of catacombs the knights used to bury their honored dead. The entrance is through a stairway descending from the temple (now Mekkalath's lair), but the stairs are choked with rubble. The catacombs include shrines to various gods, memorials to the knights' many exploits, and secret tombs for knights who betrayed the order and were hidden in shame. While Undead are the most likely type of creature found in the catacombs, a variety of Underdark creatures could have dug their way into these tunnels, such as {@creature drow}, {@creature Troglodyte||troglodytes}, or an {@creature umber hulk}.": "最上层是一条蜿蜒的地下墓穴网络，骑士们曾用来埋葬他们尊敬的死者。入口位于从神殿（现在是梅卡拉斯的巢穴）下降的楼梯，但楼梯被瓦砾堵塞。墓穴包括供奉各种神祇的神龛，纪念骑士们的许多业绩，以及为背叛誓约的骑士隐藏在羞耻中的秘密坟墓。虽然不死生物是在墓穴中最可能发现的生物类型，但各种地底世界生物可能已经挖掘到这些隧道中，比如{@creature drow}、{@creature Troglodyte||troglodytes}，或者一个{@creature umber hulk}。",
	"Beneath the catacombs lie the vaults that hold the abandoned minotaur settlement, centered around a temple to Bahamut and other good gods that was corrupted to the worship of Baphomet. Stairways descend to this level from the old barrack and hall atop the hill, and a winding tunnel leads west from the vaults to the base of the hill. While the stairs are choked with lava and rubble, this tunnel would still be navigable if its entrance on the hill's slope were uncovered, a project that would take several individuals a day to complete. Worship of Baphomet has lured demons to these halls, but shrines to good deities might be protected by angels or Constructs such as {@creature Iron Golem||iron golems}, {@creature Stone Golem||stone golems}, a {@creature shield guardian}, or {@creature Helmed Horror||helmed horrors}. Additionally any of the subterranean creatures in the catacombs might have advanced farther into the vaults. If Baphomet cultists return to the vaults, they would soon summon further horrifying evils.": "在地下墓穴下面，是保存着被遗弃的牛头怪定居点的地窖，围绕着一个供奉巴哈姆特和其他善神的神殿，但这座神庙已经被腐化成了朝拜巴福梅特的地方。从山顶的旧兵营和大厅通往这一层的楼梯，而从地窖通往山脚的西侧则有一条蜿蜒的隧道。虽然楼梯被熔岩和瓦砾堵塞，但如果山坡上的入口被发现，这条隧道仍然是可通行的，这个项目需要几个人花费一天的时间来完成。巴福梅特的崇拜已经吸引了恶魔来到这些大厅，但善神的神龛可能会受到天使或者类似{@creature Iron Golem||iron golems}、{@creature Stone Golem||stone golems}、{@creature shield guardian}或{@creature Helmed Horror||helmed horrors}的构造物的保护。此外，地下墓穴中的任何生物都可能已经深入到地窖中。如果巴福梅特的教徒返回地窖，他们很快就会召唤出更可怕的邪恶生物。",
	"This chapter, intended for DMs, details a dungeon called the Donjon Sphere. You can use this dungeon to describe the fate of a character who draws the Donjon card from a {@item Deck of Many Things}.

	"The Donjon Sphere is a metal sphere that drifts through the Astral Sea. Centuries ago, an unknown species of intelligent beings built the sphere to capture and contain specimens from across the cosmos. They used strange magic to peer into the minds of their captives and observe them in simulated environments, curious to understand the minds of these alien creatures. When the first {@item Deck of Many Things} was created, the Donjon card was linked to the sphere, sending prisoners there.": "地牢之球是一个漂浮在星界中的金属球。几个世纪前，一种未知的智慧生物种族建造了这个球，用来捕获和囚禁来自宇宙各地的标本。他们使用奇异的魔法窥视囚禁者的思维，并在模拟环境中观察它们，好奇地想要了解这些外星生物的思维。当第一个{@item Deck of Many Things}被创建时，地牢牌被与这个球连接起来，将囚犯送往那里。",
	"The collective distress of the sphere's prisoners ultimately attracted the attention of a group of {@creature Feyr|BAM|feyrs}: Astral Sea monsters that feed on creatures' nightmares. The feyrs infiltrated the Donjon Sphere and wrought havoc, forcing the sphere's stewards to abandon it. After devouring the nightmares of everyone left inside the sphere, the feyrs moved on.": "球体囚犯的集体苦恼最终吸引了一群{@creature Feyr|BAM|feyrs}: 食用生物噩梦的星界海怪的注意。这些费尔斯渗透进了地狱监狱球体并造成了混乱，迫使球体的管理者们放弃了它。在吞噬了球体内所有留下的人的噩梦后，费尔斯离开了。",
	"Since then, the Donjon Sphere has drifted through the Astral Sea. Automated systems keep the vessel working and on course, and Constructs called detention drones bring in a steady supply of fresh specimens. However, swaths of the sphere have fallen into disrepair or outright mayhem. For new arrivals, many brought by a {@item Deck of Many Things}, the anarchy means it's never been easier to wriggle free of the dungeon's crumbling wards and traps. However, this same chaos still makes banishment to the sphere extremely perilous.": "从那时起，地牢之球一直漂浮在星界之海中。自动系统保持着飞船的运转和航向，而被称为拘留无人机的构造体则带来了源源不断的新样本。然而，球体的许多区域已经陷入了失修或彻底的混乱之中。对于新到达的人，许多是被{@item Deck of Many Things}带来的，这种无政府状态意味着从地牢破败的结界和陷阱中挣脱变得前所未有地容易。然而，同样的混乱也使放逐到这个球体变得极其危险。",
	"The Donjon Sphere is too small to be observed from any planet's surface without a telescope or magical aid, but clues to the sphere's whereabouts can still be found among the stars.": "地牢之球(Donjon Sphere)太小了，没有望远镜或魔法辅助，无法从任何行星表面观察到它，但仍然可以在星空中找到指向该球位置的线索。",
	"A character with a {@item Deck of Many Things} can deduce the Donjon Sphere's location by spending 8 hours studying the night sky and using the cards as a divination tool. Afterward, the character must succeed on a DC 22 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check to determine the sphere's coordinates in the Astral Sea. On a failed check, the character fails to calculate the sphere's location but can try again the next day, reducing the DC of the check by 1 for each consecutive attempt. Other methods of finding the sphere are detailed in the \"Adventure Hooks\" section below.": "一个拥有{@item Deck of Many Things}的角色可以通过花费8小时研究夜空，并使用牌组作为占卜工具来推断地牢之球的位置。之后，角色必须在一次DC 22的智力检定中成功，以确定地牢之球在星界的坐标。如果检定失败，角色未能计算出地牢之球的位置，但可以在第二天再次尝试，每连续尝试一次，检定的DC值减少1。在下面的“冒险钩子”部分详细介绍了寻找地牢之球的其他方法。",
	"Once the sphere is located in the Astral Sea, the characters must reach it, probably using teleportation magic or a spelljamming vessel.": "一旦球体位于星界海(Astral Sea)中，角色们必须到达它，可能需要使用传送魔法或者一个法术航行飞船（spelljamming vessel）。",

She approaches the party after a character draws the Donjon card and disappears. {@creature Asteria|BMT} knows the pain of losing a friend to unjust imprisonment and offers to help. She draws a replica of the teleportation circle inside the sphere.

	"The Donjon Sphere's hollow interior is divided into several nested layers, as shown in {@book map 17.1|BMT|16|Map 17.1: Donjon Sphere}.

	"The outer surface of the sphere is perfectly smooth, made from hundreds of panels of rare space metals. When debris or attackers mar the surface, repair drones replace the damaged panels within hours. A 50-foot-wide circular hatch just off the sphere's equator is the only surface entrance. This hatch opens and closes automatically for detention drones leaving and entering the sphere.": "这个球体的外表面非常光滑，由数百块稀有太空金属板制成。当碎片或攻击者破坏表面时，维修无人机会在几小时内更换受损的板块。在球体赤道附近有一个直径50英尺的圆形舱口，是唯一的表面入口。这个舱口会自动打开和关闭，供离开和进入球体的执法无人机使用。",
	"The ends of a sharp spindle protrude from each of the sphere's poles like antennae.

	"In addition, like the wrinkles of a brain, the Gilded Labyrinth's countless reflective surfaces and edges amplify the invisible energy radiated from the sphere's power core. This effect can't be perceived by most creatures, but the energy collected is vital to the sphere's continued operation.": "此外，就像大脑的皱纹一样，镀金迷宫无数的反射表面和边缘放大了从球体动力核心散发出的无形能量。这种效应大多数生物无法感知，但收集的能量对于球体的持续运作至关重要。",

They drift through reality like living voids, remaining unseen while searching for souls to consume.

	"This chapter details the Grim Harrow, doomed Undead that seek the {@item Deck of Many Things} in all its forms so they can destroy it and end their own existence. But as the {@item Deck of Many Things} has multiplied through the multiverse, the Grim Harrow's goal has become increasingly difficult. Nevertheless, this menace scours the multiverse for any version of the deck, destroying anyone or anything that gets in the way. Consisting of Undead creatures of varying strength—from shadows and carrion birds to powerful champions of violence and despair—the Grim Harrow is an antagonist for campaigns of all levels, whether a {@item Deck of Many Things} appears in your campaign or not.": "本章详细描述了Grim Harrow，这些注定要失败的不死生物寻找{@item Deck of Many Things}的各种形式，以便摧毁它并结束自己的存在。但随着{@item Deck of Many Things}在多元宇宙中的增多，Grim Harrow的目标变得越来越困难。尽管如此，这个威胁仍然在多元宇宙中搜寻任何版本的牌组，摧毁一切阻碍它的人或事物。Grim Harrow由不同强度的不死生物组成——从阴影和腐肉鸟到暴力和绝望的强大冠军，是各级别冒险的对手，无论你的冒险中是否出现{@item Deck of Many Things}。",

For centuries, these Undead aimlessly wandered the multiverse, until a grim champion began seeking out its fellow victims and forged those it found into a force it called the Grim Harrow. Eventually, the Grim Harrow found a faerie demiplane called the Gardens of Delight.

	"Since making the Gardens of Decay their home, the creatures of the Grim Harrow can leave it only for limited periods (see the \"{@book Gardens of Decay|BMT|18|Gardens of Decay}\" section later in this chapter for more information), so they seek out ordinary mortals or unusual extraplanar allies to be their agents on other worlds. The leaders of the Grim Harrow—fearsome Undead called grim champions—select privileged servants to leave the gardens on harrowing hunts or other key missions.

She travels the roads trying to sell her father's goods, ignorant of the dangers the deck attracts. {@creature Sir Jared|BMT|Jared}, a knight of the Solar Bastion (see {@book chapter 10|BMT|9|Sir Jared}), enlists the characters to find Laurel before the Grim Harrow does. When the adventurers reach her, however, they learn she has sold the deck, and a harrowing hunt has already begun.": "劳瑞尔（Laurel）是一位年轻女子，最近继承了她父亲的商用马车，在马车的货物中发现了一副塔罗牌{@item Deck of Many Things}。她沿着道路旅行，试图出售她父亲的商品，却对这副牌所吸引的危险一无所知。太阳堡垒（Solar Bastion）的骑士（见%2%）{@creature Sir Jared|BMT|Jared}招募角色们，在鬼魅镰刀（Grim Harrow）找到劳瑞尔之前。然而，当冒险者们找到她时，他们发现她已经卖掉了这副牌，一场艰难的追捕已经开始。",
	"{@creature Oddlewin|BMT} is a fortune teller in Seelie Market. He is being hunted by a {@creature revenant} and fled the market to avoid endangering his friends there. He enlists the characters to protect him, offering magical trinkets and the opportunity to draw from his {@item Deck of Many Things}. But when the Grim Harrow begins to close in, {@creature Oddlewin|BMT} hides the deck among the characters' belongings and flees, sending the harrowing hunt in pursuit of the characters.": "{@creature Oddlewin|BMT}是西利市场的一个算命师。他正在被{@creature revenant}追捕，逃离市场以避免危及他在那里的朋友。他请求角色们保护他，提供魔法小玩意和从他的{@item Deck of Many Things}中抽取机会。但当严酷的哈洛开始逼近时，{@creature Oddlewin|BMT}将牌组藏在角色的物品中并逃走，派遣哈洛追捕角色。",
	"{@creature Asteria|BMT} (see {@book chapter 22|BMT|21|Asteria}) believes the Grim Champion of Desolation might be someone she knew from her youth, and if she's right, she's certain that person can be returned to the path of good. {@creature Asteria|BMT} asks the adventurers to infiltrate the Gardens of Decay to learn that champion's true identity. If the champion is who {@creature Asteria|BMT} suspects, {@creature Asteria|BMT} wants the characters to bring the champion out of the garden to a place where she can confront the champion.": "{@creature Asteria|BMT}（见{@book chapter 22|BMT|21|Asteria}）相信荒凉冠军可能是她年轻时认识的某人，如果她是对的，她确信那个人可以回到善良的道路上。{@creature Asteria|BMT}请求冒险者们潜入腐朽花园，了解那位冠军的真实身份。如果冠军是{@creature Asteria|BMT}怀疑的人，{@creature Asteria|BMT}希望角色们将冠军带出花园，到一个地方让她能够面对冠军。",
	"The characters are recruited to search for a {@item Deck of Many Things} by a wealthy patron, Lord Verin Oakley, who claims descent from a famous knight who once owned this deck. Verin insists he has an ancestral claim to it, and he is willing to pay handsomely. Verin sends the characters on all manner of adventures, always looking for any sign of the deck. But when they finally locate it and return it to him, they learn Verin is an agent of the Grim Harrow and hopes to attain vampirism or another form of immortality as a reward for handing over the deck.": "这些角色被一位富有的赞助人，(Lord Verin Oakley)募集来寻找一副{@item Deck of Many Things}，他声称是一位曾经拥有这副牌的著名骑士的后代。Verin坚称他对这副牌有着祖传的所有权，并且愿意慷慨报酬。Verin派遣这些角色去进行各种冒险，总是在寻找这副牌的任何迹象。但当他们最终找到它并归还给他时，他们发现Verin是(格林哈罗)的代理人，希望通过交出这副牌来获得吸血鬼化或其他形式的永生。",
	"The Grim Harrow is led by three powerful entities with the title of grim champion. Each champion embodies a terrible facet of death. Jyn Corvis, Grim Champion of Desolation, is the oldest and most powerful of the three and embodies all-consuming nothingness. She led the Grim Harrow to the Gardens of Delight long ago and is the nominal leader of all the Undead in the demiplane. The other two champions—Wynemar Brack, {@creature Grim Champion of Bloodshed|BMT}, and Aleron, Grim Champion of Pestilence—rival Jyn for power and together can oppose her. The fact that the three champions rarely agree on anything is a major check on the group's power. Instead of the Grim Harrow acting as a unified force, each of the three champions usually pursues their own interests, seldom cooperating or sharing intelligence or resources.": "冥沟（Grim Harrow）由三位拥有冥魂勇士（grim champion）头衔的强大实体领导。每位冥魂勇士体现了死亡的可怕面貌。Jyn Corvis（吉恩·科维斯）, 荒凉之冥（Grim Champion of Desolation）, 是这三人中最年长、最强大的，体现了无尽的虚无。她很久以前带领冥沟来到了快乐园（Gardens of Delight），是这个半位面中所有不死生物的名义领袖。另外两位冥魂勇士——Wynemar Brack（温尼玛·布拉克）, {@creature Grim Champion of Bloodshed|BMT}，和Aleron（阿莱隆）, 瘟疫之冥（Grim Champion of Pestilence）——与吉恩争夺权力，他们联手可以对抗她。这三位冥魂勇士很少在任何事情上达成一致，这是对该团体权力的主要制约。冥沟并不像一个统一的力量，而是三位冥魂勇士通常追求各自的利益，很少合作或共享情报或资源。",
	"I don't fear death—haven't for a while, in fact. It's a blessed consequence of living such a long and adventurous life. But I fear the Grim Harrow's leaders.": "我不害怕死亡—实际上已经有一段时间了。这是活过如此漫长而充满冒险的生活的一种幸运后果。但我害怕《死神耙》的领导者们。",
	"Wynemar Brack was once a farmer, but mercenaries in a local war razed her fields and sacked her village. In desperation, she yielded to the clever patter of a traveling fortune teller and drew from a {@item Deck of Many Things}. The avatar of death slew her in a flash. That was many centuries ago, and Wynemar is now a powerful and bloodthirsty Undead commander of the Grim Harrow.": "温玛·布拉克（Wynemar Brack）曾经是一名农民，但在一场当地战争中，雇佣兵们毁掉了她的田地，洗劫了她的村庄。在绝望中，她屈服于一个巧舌如簧的流浪算命者，并从{@item Deck of Many Things}中获得了力量。死亡的化身瞬间杀死了她。那是许多个世纪前的事了，温玛现在是强大而嗜血的不死族指挥官，统领着严酷的哈洛军团（Grim Harrow）。",
	"Wreathed in searing fire, Wynemar embodies the havoc of violence and war. She rides a flaming steed that uses the {@creature nightmare} stat block but is an Undead instead of a Fiend.": "被灼热火焰环绕着，温玛尔体现了暴力和战争的混乱。她骑着一匹燃烧着火焰的战马，使用{@creature nightmare}的属性块，但是是不死生物，而不是恶魔。",
	"Well, that's not quite correct, either. Rather, I fear the sheer destruction those three grim champions leave in their wake. Their lives might be condemned to undeath and annihilation, but then they stampede across the multiverse, violently killing so many innocents whose stories have yet to be written. I want to empathize with them; I've tried to put myself in their places and understand their motives. But I can't. They're simply abhorrent.": "嗯，那也不完全正确。相反，我害怕那三位阴森冠军在他们身后留下的毁灭。他们的生命可能注定要被诅咒为不死之身和湮灭，但当他们横冲直撞穿越多元宇宙时，残忍地杀害了许多尚未被书写故事的无辜者。我想要同情他们；我曾试图置身于他们的位置，理解他们的动机。但我做不到。他们简直令人憎恶。",
	"Jyn Corvis, a former adventurer, might have been the first person to draw the Skull card from a {@item Deck of Many Things} and be slain by the {@creature avatar of death|DMG}. Even Jyn doesn't know for sure, as that was so long ago that she's forgotten almost everything about her former life. Jyn's existence over so many centuries has left her in tortured misery, and now nihilism is all that drives her. More than any other member of the Grim Harrow, Jyn is desperate to destroy the deck and end her painful existence. If she could, she'd take the entire multiverse with her.": "Jyn Corvis（Jyn Corvis）, 一名前冒险者，可能是第一个从一副{@item Deck of Many Things}中抽到骷髅牌并被{@creature avatar of death|DMG}杀死的人。即使是Jyn自己也不能确定，因为那发生在很久以前，她几乎忘记了关于自己前世的一切。几个世纪以来，Jyn的存在让她备受折磨，现在虚无主义是她的唯一动力。与Grim Harrow的其他成员相比，Jyn更渴望摧毁这副牌并结束她痛苦的存在。如果可以的话，她愿意带着整个多元宇宙一起消失。",
	"The {@creature Grim Champion of Desolation|BMT} rides a malevolent draconic beast with pale, leathery wings and emaciated skin; this mount uses the {@creature wyvern} stat block, but it is an Undead instead of a Dragon. An eerie, hollow silence heralds the champion's arrival.": "{@creature Grim Champion of Desolation|BMT} 骑着一只邪恶的龙类野兽，它拥有苍白的皮翼和憔悴的皮肤；这匹坐骑使用{@creature wyvern}的属性块，但它是一个不死生物而不是龙类。一种怪异而空洞的寂静宣告了这位冠军的到来。",
	"I remember my first encounter with this champion. All of a sudden, everything around me went painfully silent. The ringing of blades, the rustle of clothing, the hum of magic—all gone. It was like I was stuck, observing the world through a frosted pane of glass.": "我记得我第一次遇到这位冠军。突然间，我周围的一切都变得痛苦地寂静下来。刀剑的撞击声、衣物的沙沙声、魔法的嗡鸣——全部消失了。就像我被困在透过一块冰冻玻璃观察世界一样。",
	"Aleron was once a tiefling adventurer, but unlike so many victims of the {@item Deck of Many Things}, he never drew the Skull card. Instead, when one of his allies drew the card and faced the {@creature avatar of death|DMG}, Aleron came to his ally's aid. A second avatar of death appeared, and Aleron was slain; soon after, his Undead corpse crawled from Withered Vineyard, tainted with plague. Aleron resents his fellow Undead in the Grim Harrow, considering himself better than all of them and unjustly condemned to the Gardens of Decay for an act of altruism.": "阿莱隆曾经是一名鬼族冒险者，但与{@item Deck of Many Things}的许多受害者不同，他从未抽到骷髅牌。相反，当他的一个盟友抽到这张牌并面对{@creature avatar of death|DMG}时，阿莱隆前来帮助他的盟友。第二个死亡化身出现，阿莱隆被杀；不久之后，他的不死尸体从枯萎葡萄园爬出，被瘟疫污染。阿莱隆厌恶格林哈洛的同类不死生物，认为自己比他们所有人都优秀，却因一次利他行为被不公正地判定为堕落花园的囚徒。",
	"Though the weakest of the Harrow's three leaders, the {@creature Grim Champion of Pestilence|BMT} is nonetheless a fearsome entity of sickness and blight. A swarm of insects surrounds him in a mockery of a halo, and debilitating plagues flow from his fingertips. Aleron rides a {@creature warhorse skeleton} with flies buzzing in its gaping eye sockets.": "虽然哈洛三位领袖中最弱的，{@creature Grim Champion of Pestilence|BMT} 仍然是一个令人畏惧的疾病和枯萎的实体。一群昆虫围绕着他，形成了一个讽刺的光环，使人瘫痪的瘟疫从他的指尖流出。阿莱隆骑着一匹{@creature warhorse skeleton}，它的眼眶里嗡嗡作响。",
	"We fought. I survived. I couldn't speak for days afterward.": "我们战斗了。我幸存了下来。之后几天我都说不出话来。",
	"When the Grim Harrow first found the faerie realm known as the Gardens of Delight, that place was home to a large population of {@creature Blink Dog||blink dogs}. The Undead invaders slaughtered the blink dogs and settled in the gardens, transforming the demiplane forever. In time, the necrotic magic of the Grim Harrow animated the corpses of the blink dogs as the first {@creature Harrow Hound|BMT|harrow hounds}.": "当Grim Harrow首次发现被称为Delight花园的仙境时，那个地方是{@creature Blink Dog||blink dogs}的家园。不死族入侵者屠杀了眨眼狗，然后在花园里定居，永远改变了这个半位面。随着时间的推移，Grim Harrow的死灵魔法使眨眼狗的尸体复活为第一个{@creature Harrow Hound|BMT|harrow hounds}。",
	"The Grim Harrow employs harrow hounds as trackers and companions. Harrow hounds are especially useful when investigating possible sightings of a {@item Deck of Many Things}. If a harrow hound catches the scent of its prey, it never loses it, even if the hound and its fellow hunters return to the Gardens of Decay with the hunt incomplete. Powerful Undead, such as vampires and death knights, might be accompanied by packs of harrow hounds.": "阴森犁地(The Grim Harrow)雇佣占卜猎犬(harrow hounds)作为追踪者和伙伴。当调查可能看到{@item Deck of Many Things}的情况时，占卜猎犬特别有用。如果一只占卜猎犬嗅到猎物的气味，即使猎犬和其伙伴们带着未完成的猎物返回腐朽花园(Gardens of Decay)，也永远不会丢失猎物的踪迹。强大的不死生物，如吸血鬼和死亡骑士，可能会有一群占卜猎犬作伴。",
	"The following pages detail three unique Fiends designed to be recurring adversaries for your campaign. Each entry includes a description and details about the Fiend's background, suggestions for ways to use this adversary in your campaign, and its stat block. In addition, each Fiend is accompanied by new rules elements that you can use on their own or in tandem with the Fiend.": "以下页面详细介绍了三种独特的恶魔，设计成您战役中的经常对手。每个条目包括描述和恶魔背景的细节，建议您在战役中使用此对手的方式，以及其属性块。此外，每个恶魔都附带新的规则元素，您可以单独使用或与恶魔一起使用。",
	"A character who draws the Flames card from a {@item Deck of Many Things} attracts the ire of a powerful Fiend. The three malevolent beings described in this chapter can each fill that role, but you can incorporate these fearsome foes into your campaign in other ways. Characters might stumble across evidence of heinous deeds performed by one of these monsters or its servants, or you could make opposing one of these Fiends the backbone of an entire campaign. Although these creatures span a wide level range and should be usable in most campaigns, you can always adjust these stat blocks to make the Fiends more suitable challenges for your characters. The possibilities are as endless as the layers of the Abyss.": "从牌堆中抽取{@item Deck of Many Things}的角色会招致一位强大的恶魔的愤怒。本章描述的三个邪恶存在都可以扮演这个角色，但你也可以以其他方式将这些可怕的敌人融入你的冒险中。角色可能偶然发现其中一个怪物或其仆从所犯下的滔天罪行的证据，或者你可以让对抗其中一个恶魔成为整个冒险的核心。尽管这些生物的等级范围广泛，适用于大多数冒险，但你可以随时调整这些属性块，使恶魔更适合成为你的角色的挑战。可能性就像无底深渊的层次一样无穷无尽。",
	"The demon lord {@creature Aurnozci|BMT} is a wormlike horror of fiery flesh and toxic seepage. In its present form, {@creature Aurnozci|BMT} can't leave Xulregg, the Abyssal layer that's both its fiefdom and its prison. It lairs within a grotesque hive dangling from a mountain-size tree of tar and flame called Gorewood.": "恶魔领主{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}是一只燃烧的肉体和有毒渗出物的蠕虫般恐怖存在。在目前的形态下，{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}无法离开Xulregg，这是既是其封地又是监狱的深渊层。它居住在一座悬挂在一棵巨大的焦油和火焰树上的怪诞蜂巢中，这棵树被称为Gorewood。",
	"{@creature Aurnozci|BMT} relies on demonic proxies and mortal worshipers to enact its will beyond the Abyss. The exact nature of the curse that binds {@creature Aurnozci|BMT} to Xulregg is its cult's most closely guarded secret, fully known only to the faith's enigmatic leader, a masked {@creature archmage} called the Eye of {@creature Aurnozci|BMT}.": "{@creature Aurnozci|BMT} 依赖恶魔代理和凡人崇拜者来执行其意志，超越深渊。将 {@creature Aurnozci|BMT} 与库尔雷格绑定的诅咒的确切性质是该教派最严密保守的秘密，只有信仰的神秘领袖，一个名为 {@creature Aurnozci|BMT} 的蒙面 {@creature archmage}，完全了解。",
	"{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}'s followers believe the demon lord's imprisonment is coming to an end, and soon the Caged Worm will shed its current form and transform into an even more powerful shape. Once it attains this new form, {@creature Aurnozci|BMT} can escape Xulregg and wreak havoc across the multiverse. To accelerate this terrible transformation, cultists hunt down mortal souls for violent ritual sacrifice to their god.": "{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}的追随者相信恶魔领主的囚禁即将结束，很快，被囚禁的蠕虫将蜕变出更强大的形态。一旦获得这个新形态，{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}就能逃离Xulregg，在多元宇宙中肆虐。为加速这可怕的转变，邪教徒追捕凡间灵魂，用于向他们的神进行暴力祭祀。",
	"{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}'s cult targets mortals to use as sacrifices for the demon lord. The cult's hordes of minions travel throughout the Material Plane to bedevil and capture less powerful creatures and enemies of the cult. Lower-level characters could earn the cult's ire by stepping on the wrong toes during their early adventures, such as by attacking a sect of the cult.": "{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}的教派以凡人为目标，用作恶魔领主的祭品。该教派的大批手下在物质位面上四处游荡，折磨和捕获比他们弱小的生物和教派的敌人。低等级角色可能会在早期冒险中得罪该教派，比如攻击了该教派的一个分支，从而招致他们的怒火。",
	"The cult's leader, the Eye of {@creature Aurnozci|BMT}, focuses on powerful mortals or enemies of the cult. High-level characters with a record of heroic deeds can easily fall into this category. The Eye of {@creature Aurnozci|BMT} might also take interest in a mortal who draws the Flames card from a {@item Deck of Many Things}—a tantalizing opportunity for the cult to make good on the card's dire prophecy.": "这个邪教的领袖，{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}之眼，专注于强大的凡人或邪教的敌人。有着英雄事迹记录的高级角色很容易被归类为这一类别。{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}之眼也可能对从{@item Deck of Many Things}中抽取了火焰牌的凡人感兴趣——这对邪教来说是一个诱人的机会，可以兑现牌上的可怕预言。",
	"Once a character is targeted by the cult of {@creature Aurnozci|BMT}, fiendish assassins assail the party. If the Caged Worm and its followers are the primary antagonists in your campaign, these attacks could happen as frequently as every session; otherwise, space them out every few sessions. At first, the foes might be lesser demons like {@creature manes} or {@creature Dretch||dretches}, or Humanoid {@creature Cultist||cultists} of {@creature Aurnozci|BMT}. As the characters level up, the enemies gradually increase in strength. Between fights, the characters can slowly unravel details of the cult pursuing them. By the time the characters learn they must travel to the Abyss to stop the cult's aggression, they might be regularly encountering throngs of {@creature Glabrezu||glabrezus}, {@creature Nalfeshnee||nalfeshnees}, or other powerful demons.": "一旦一个角色成为{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}教派的目标，邪恶的刺客就会袭击队伍。如果被囚禁的蠕虫及其追随者是你战役中的主要对手，这些袭击可能会每次游戏会话都发生；否则，可以每隔几次游戏会话发生一次。起初，敌人可能是像{@creature manes}或{@creature Dretch||dretches}这样的次级恶魔，或者{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}的{@creature Cultist||cultists}。随着角色升级，敌人的实力会逐渐增强。在战斗之间，角色可以慢慢揭开追踪他们的教派的细节。当角色得知他们必须前往深渊阻止教派的侵略时，他们可能会经常遭遇{@creature Glabrezu||glabrezus}、{@creature Nalfeshnee||nalfeshnees}或其他强大的恶魔群。",
	"The party's journey to Xulregg and infiltration of Gorewood are adventures in themselves. A map of Gorewood and an overview of the locations within this Abyssal realm appear later in this chapter.": "队伍前往瑟尔雷格(Xulregg)并渗透戈尔伍德(Gorewood)的旅程本身就是一次冒险。戈尔伍德的地图以及这个深渊领域内各个地点的概述将在本章后面出现。",
	"Depending on your players' actions, the characters might resolve their final confrontation with {@creature Aurnozci|BMT}'s cult by diplomacy or by force. The safest way to escape the cult is to confront the Eye of {@creature Aurnozci|BMT} and persuade this shadowy villain to call off the attacks. Alternatively, a strong enough party might take the fight to {@creature Aurnozci|BMT} in its hive and attempt to slay the demon lord once and for all.": "根据玩家的行动，角色们可能通过外交或武力解决与{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}教派的最终对抗。逃离教派最安全的方法是直面{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}之眼，并说服这位神秘的恶棍停止袭击。另外，一个实力足够强大的队伍可能会将战斗带到{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}的巢穴，并试图一劳永逸地杀死这位恶魔领主。",
	"{@creature Aurnozci|BMT} grants its cultists the following trait:": "{@creature Aurnozci|BMT} 赋予其信徒以下特质：",
	"When the creature dies, its body is reduced to a pile of smoldering embers in the space where it fell. The ashes take 1 minute to cool.

	"{@creature Aurnozci|BMT} is a being of mindless destruction, and the Caged Worm has few dealings with mortals that don't end in consumption. Periodically, the Eye of {@creature Aurnozci|BMT} communes with their horrifying master or leads a ceremony of propitiation in the Firehive. In combat, {@creature Aurnozci|BMT} screeches horribly and attacks any intruders in sight with reckless abandon.": "{@creature Aurnozci|BMT} 是一个毁灭无情的存在，而被囚禁的蠕虫与凡人很少有交往，而这些交往往以被消灭告终。定期，{@creature Aurnozci|BMT} 之眼会与他们可怕的主人交流，或者在火蜂巢中主持一场谄媚仪式。在战斗中，{@creature Aurnozci|BMT} 发出可怕的尖叫声，毫不顾忌地袭击任何入侵者。",
	"The Abyssal layer of Xulregg is a sweltering forest of massive trees, rotting undergrowth, and boiling marshes.": "Xulregg（Xulregg）的深渊层是一个滚热的森林，有巨大的树木、腐烂的灌木丛和沸腾的沼泽。",
	"The following locations are keyed to map 20.1.": "以下位置对应地图20.1。",
	"The center of Xulregg is Gorewood, a massive gum tree in an eternal state of smoldering decay. Gorewood's trunk is as large as any mountain on the Material Plane, and its winding branches are as broad and meandering as river deltas. Thousands of chambers, tunnels, and halls—all claimed by the cult of {@creature Aurnozci|BMT}—riddle the tree's rotten interior.": "Xulregg的中心是Gorewood(戈尔伍德), 一棵巨大的树胶树，永恒地处于燃烧腐烂的状态。 Gorewood的树干和物质位面上的任何一座山一样巨大，其蜿蜒的树枝宽广而曲折，如同河流三角洲。成千上万的房间、隧道和大厅——所有这些都被{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}教派占据——遍布在这棵腐烂的树内部。",
	"Huge sections of the tree crackle and glow with ancient embers, though Gorewood grows faster than any fire can destroy it. Wet, sticky tar seeps from Gorewood's bark, fueling the tree's eon-spanning burn but also keeping the fire in check.": "巨大的树干部分发出噼啪声，闪烁着古老的余烬，尽管（Gorewood）生长速度比任何火灾都快。湿漉漉、黏糊糊的焦油从（Gorewood）的树皮渗出，为这棵树跨越时代的燃烧提供燃料，同时也控制着火势。",
	"{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}'s nest hangs from one of Gorewood's strongest, knobbiest branches, secured by a hundred-foot-thick cord of {@creature Aurnozci|BMT}'s iron-hard silk. The nest itself, called the Firehive, resembles a gargantuan wasp nest with an open top. {@creature Aurnozci|BMT}'s power causes the Firehive to throb like a beating heart, and the nest's surface is hot to the touch.": "{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}的巢悬挂在戈尔伍德(Gorewood)最坚固、最多疙瘩的树枝之一上，用一根厚达一百英尺的{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}坚硬丝线系着。这个巢本身被称为火蜂巢(Firehive)，类似于一个巨大的黄蜂巢，顶部敞开。{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}的力量让火蜂巢像跳动的心脏一样悸动，巢的表面触摸起来很热。",
	"Halfway up the Firehive, a ramshackle platform of regurgitated bones encircles the nest. From here, demonic pilgrims and priests of {@creature Aurnozci|BMT} peer through cracks in the nest's wall to gaze upon their dread lord. A broken Gorewood limb overlooks the opening at the top of the nest. {@creature Aurnozci|BMT}'s servants throw sacrifices to it from this overlook, and the Eye of {@creature Aurnozci|BMT} conducts profane rituals atop a dais on the tree limb's edge.": "火蜂巢的半途处，一个摇摇欲坠的平台由反刍的骨头环绕着巢穴。从这里，{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}的恶魔朝圣者和祭司们透过巢穴墙壁上的裂缝凝视他们的恐怖领主。一根破碎的{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}木枝俯瞰着巢穴顶部的开口。{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}的仆人们从这个眺望处向它献祭，而{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}之眼则在树枝边缘的台上进行亵渎的仪式。",
	"When {@creature Aurnozci|BMT}'s minions are destroyed on the Material Plane, their souls slip through cracks in the multiverse and drip to Xulregg to feed Gorewood's thirsty roots. After a time, Gorewood rebirths the recycled demons, excreting each into its own chrysalis-like pod made from the tree's fleshy inner wood. The massive hollow chamber in Gorewood from which these chrysalises develop, bulge, and pop is called the Scabbery. Not simply a disgusting moniker, the Scabbery's name is also a reference to the way that demons reborn here emerge harder, stronger, and crueler than before.": "当{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}的手下在物质位面被摧毁时，它们的灵魂会穿过多元宇宙的裂缝滴落到古尔雷格（Xulregg），以滋养戈尔伍德（Gorewood）口渴的根系。过一段时间，戈尔伍德会重新诞生这些被循环利用的恶魔，将每个恶魔排泄到由树木肉质内部制成的类似蛹的荚中。这些蛹在戈尔伍德的巨大空洞室内发育、膨胀和破裂，这个空洞室被称为疤室（Scabbery）。疤室不仅仅是一个恶心的别名，它的名字也指的是在这里重新诞生的恶魔会比以前更加坚硬、更强大和更残忍。",
	"The endless miles of sodden tunnels and caves beneath Gorewood are called the Warrens of Rot. Each passage was once a tentacular root that at some point caught fire, burned away, and became a hollow charcoal tube.

Strange, fiendish beasts lurk in the Warrens' unexplored corners, so even powerful demons don't linger in these tunnels.": "在戈尔伍德下面无尽的潮湿隧道和洞穴被称为腐烂洞穴。每一条通道曾经是一根触手状的根，某个时候着火，燃烧殆尽，变成了一个空心的木炭管道。闯入{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}领域的入侵者被困在腐烂洞穴中，成为将来被献祭给囚笼蠕虫的对象。奇异、邪恶的野兽潜伏在腐烂洞穴未被探索的角落，因此即使是强大的恶魔也不会在这些隧道中逗留。",
	"Vile offal drips from the bottom of the Firehive and collects on the ground below. This boggy wetland has become a fertile breeding ground called Whitemarsh: a primordial soup that gives rise to all manner of monsters. The weakest specimens are gobbled up by hungry demons fresh from the Scabbery. Sometimes, powerful behemoths with freakish powers emerge from Whitemarsh. Most such beings flee Xulregg or are captured and sacrificed to {@creature Aurnozci|BMT}, though a few have been allowed to live and serve the Caged Worm as honored guardians.": "恶臭的废物从火蜂巢底部滴落，并在下方积聚。这片泥泞的湿地已经变成了一个肥沃的繁殖场所，被称为白沼泽：一个原始的汤池，孕育出各种怪物。最弱的个体被刚从疮疤地出来的饥饿恶魔吞食。有时，拥有怪异力量的强大巨兽会从白沼泽中出现。大多数这样的生物会逃离克尔雷格，或者被捕获并献祭给{@creature Aurnozci|BMT}，尽管有一些被允许活下来，作为被尊敬的守护者为笼中蠕虫效劳。",

On the rare occasion when her social graces fail to achieve the desired result, {@creature Hulgaz|BMT} turns her natural weapons on her victims.": "如同来自泥泞的迷乱之地的女公爵，{@creature Hulgaz|BMT}看起来既庄严又永远湿漉漉的，她纠结的头发缠绕在湿漉漉的衣物上。尽管她有着威严，{@creature Hulgaz|BMT}的邪恶本性却体现在她的怪物般特征上：兽爪、光亮的黑眼睛，以及尾部类似蛇一样，尖端带着有毒刺。在极少数情况下，当她的社交技巧无法达到预期效果时，{@creature Hulgaz|BMT}会将她的天赋武器对准她的受害者。",

Her primary means of corrupting mortals is by offering them tantalizing boons called infernal blessings.": "尽管她的属性块在战斗中提供了，{@creature Hulgaz|BMT} 最好在角色扮演遭遇中作为一个经常出现的反派角色。她腐化凡人的主要手段是通过提供诱人的恩惠，称为地狱祝福。",
	"When a character attracts the attention of {@creature Hulgaz|BMT}, she or her servants confront the character and offer a boon. But any boon on offer is fated to make the recipient miserable. Even those who choose to not take part in {@creature Hulgaz|BMT}'s schemes eventually suffer at her hands.": "当一个角色吸引了{@creature Hulgaz|BMT}的注意时，她或她的仆人会与角色对峙并提供一个恩惠。但任何提供的恩惠注定会让接受者不幸。即使那些选择不参与{@creature Hulgaz|BMT}的阴谋的人最终也会受到她的伤害。",

	"{@creature Hulgaz|BMT} is a charmer in both the common and magical sense. She effortlessly ingratiates herself, instinctively deducing the most effective tack to take in any conversation.

Placing thirteen of these cards face up, one by one, Istus rewrote {@creature Asteria|BMT} and {@creature Euryale|BMT}'s story.": "受{@creature Asteria|BMT}的信念影响，伊斯塔斯勉强承认{@creature Asteria|BMT}和{@creature Euryale|BMT}的命运可以被改写，但这样做的后果是不可预测的。这两位女性可能会得到新的命运，但可能并不比之前的好，甚至更糟。但{@creature Asteria|BMT}坚持不懈，于是伊斯塔斯伸手入云，拉下二十二颗星座，形成了一副神谕牌：第一{@item Deck of Many Things}。一一展示其中十三张牌，伊斯塔斯重新书写了{@creature Asteria|BMT}和{@creature Euryale|BMT}的故事。",
	"Armed with her new destiny, {@creature Asteria|BMT} rescued {@creature Euryale|BMT}, and the two have since had many grand adventures together. In time, {@creature Euryale|BMT} longed once more for a quiet life; the two women found a site in the Outlands that reminded them of the grotto that had once been their home, and {@creature Euryale|BMT} retired there from adventuring. {@creature Asteria|BMT}, however, still felt a fervent desire to defend others from the injustice of destiny. Taking up the symbol of the medusa as an icon of protection, strength, and her dearest friend, {@creature Asteria|BMT} has continued her journey alone. But Istus's act echoed through the multiverse, and the original {@item Deck of Many Things} reflected across the planes, manifesting in varied forms throughout the cosmos.": "带着她的新命运，{@creature Asteria|BMT} 解救了{@creature Euryale|BMT}，自那时起，这两人一起经历了许多伟大的冒险。随着时间的推移，{@creature Euryale|BMT} 再次渴望平静的生活；两位女士在外域找到了一个地方，让她们想起曾经是她们家的洞穴，{@creature Euryale|BMT} 从冒险中退休到那里。然而，{@creature Asteria|BMT} 仍然渴望为他人抵御命运的不公。拿起美杜莎的象征作为保护、力量和她最亲爱的朋友，{@creature Asteria|BMT} 继续她的独自旅程。但伊斯塔斯的行动在多元宇宙中回响，原始的{@item Deck of Many Things} 在各个位面上映射出来，在整个宇宙中以不同形式显现。",

She believes everyone deserves a chance to write their own story on their own terms, and her deeds have inspired countless heroic tales.": "尽管她现在独自旅行，{@creature Asteria|BMT} 仍然从与{@creature Euryale|BMT} 的羁绊中汲取大部分力量。{@creature Asteria|BMT} 首先是一名保护者和战士，穿梭于多元宇宙，根除不义，保护无辜，并激发希望。她相信每个人都应该有机会按照自己的方式书写自己的故事，她的行为激励了无数英雄故事的诞生。",
