	"A journey takes place in Cycles that each represent the days spent travelling in the wilderness.

The length of the journey determines how many days are represented by a cycle; each cycle is one day for a short journey or 7 days for a long one.": "旅程是以 \"周期 \"为单位进行的，每个周期代表在荒野中旅行的天数。DM首先决定旅程是短还是长，这取决于人物需要多长时间才能到达目的地。旅程的长度决定了一个周期代表多少天；每个周期对于短途旅程来说是一天，对于长途旅程来说是7天。",

	"No complication.": "没有并发症。",
	"During a chase, you can take reactions as normal, but you can't make opportunity attacks against other chase participants, since you are all assumed to be moving in the same direction at the same time. However, chase participants can still be the targets of opportunity attacks from creatures not participating in the chase. For example, an adventurer who chases a bandit past a wolf in the woods might provoke an opportunity attack from the wolf.": "在追逐过程中，你可以像平常一样做出反应，但你不能对其他追逐者进行机会攻击，因为你被认为是在同一时间向同一方向移动。然而，追捕参与者仍然可以成为未参与追捕的生物的机会攻击的目标。例如，一个冒险者追赶一个强盗，经过树林中的一只狼，可能会引起狼的机会攻击。",
	"A chase ends when one side or the other stops, when the quarry escapes, or when at least one pursuer is within 5 feet of a quarry.": "当一方或另一方停止时，当猎物逃脱时，或当至少一个追捕者在猎物的5英尺范围内时，追捕就会结束。",

	"Quarry is in an uncrowded or quiet area": "采石场位于一个不拥挤或安静的地区",
	"Escape doesn't necessarily mean a quarry has outpaced pursuers. For example, in the mountains, escape might mean the quarry ducked into a crevice or a hollow log.": "逃跑并不一定意味着猎物已经超过了追捕者。例如，在山区，逃跑可能意味着猎物躲进了一个缝隙或一个空心的木头。",
	"Creatures being chased can split up into smaller groups. This tactic forces pursuers to either divide their forces or allow some of the quarry to escape. If a pursuit splits into several smaller chases, resolve each chase separately. Run a round of one chase, then a round of the next, and so on, tracking the distances for each separate group.": "被追捕的生物可以分裂成小群。这种战术迫使追捕者要么分兵，要么让一些猎物逃跑。如果一场追击战分裂成几个较小的追击队，就分别解决每个追击队。先进行一轮追捕，然后再进行一轮追捕，以此类推，追踪每一组的距离。",
	"During a chase,it's possible for the pursuers to become the quarry. For example, characters chasing a bandit through the woods might draw unwanted attention from other bandits. As they pursue the fleeing bandit, they must also evade the bandits pursuing them. Roll initiative for the new arrivals, and run both chases simultaneously. In another scenario, the fleeing bandit might run into the waiting arms of their accomplices. The outnumbered characters might decide to flee with the bandits in pursuit": "在追捕过程中，追捕者有可能成为猎物。例如，在树林中追赶一个强盗的角色可能会引起其他强盗的不必要的注意。当他们追赶逃跑的强盗时，他们也必须躲避追赶他们的强盗。为新来的人掷出主动权，并同时进行两次追击。在另一种情况下，逃跑的强盗可能会跑进他们同伙的怀抱。寡不敌众的人物可能会决定与追击的强盗一起逃跑。",
	"The DM determines the predominant weather conditions for the Cycle., you either choose the weather or roll for it on the {@table Weather|DMG} {@note ({@table weather; precipitation|DMG|Precipitation}; {@table weather; wind|DMG|Wind})} table on the DM screen.": "你可以选择天气，或者在DM屏幕上的{@table Weather|DMG}{@note ({@table weather; precipitation|DMG|Precipitation};{@table weather; wind|DMG|Wind})}表上进行滚动。",
	"The group discovers a monument. Roll on the {@table Wilderness Journeys; Monuments|ScreenWildernessKit|Monuments} table.": "这群人发现了一个纪念碑。在{@table Wilderness Journeys; Monuments|ScreenWildernessKit|Monuments}表上滚动。"
