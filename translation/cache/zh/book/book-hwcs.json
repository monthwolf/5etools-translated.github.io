	"Nature, or the forest, might be quite the distance from our homes, Twitch streams, or stages where we play RPGs like {@i 5th Edition} (because oddly enough that's the magical world we live in now). We throw dice onto surfaces made of trees whose history we are woefully clueless of. Did the tree have a story, or a family of owls living in it, or a fox kit that sheltered a storm beneath its branches? We don't know these tales as we weave our own, but the connection is still there. We're still tromping through the wilderness and smelling the fresh air and fearing its dangers, even if it's in our imagination.": "大自然，或者森林，可能离我们的家、Twitch直播、或我们玩像{@i 5th Edition}（因为奇怪的是，这是我们现在生活的魔法世界）的舞台相当遥远。我们将骰子投在由我们对其历史一无所知的树木表面上。这棵树是否有故事，或者有一家猫头鹰居住在其中，或者有一只狐狸幼崽在它的树枝下躲过暴风雨？我们不知道这些故事，因为我们编织自己的故事，但连接仍然存在。即使只是在我们的想象中，我们仍然在荒野中跋涉，嗅着新鲜空气，害怕它的危险。",
	"Storytelling on its own has always been connected to nature. Legends of animals as gods or animals as human-like protagonists permeate all cultures. The Native American stories of the trickster Raven, the Medieval fable of the {@i Owl and the Nightingale}, or something as obvious and simple as {@i Grimm's Fairy Tales} are all examples of how the natural world around us has shaped storytelling. The magic of animals and their usually unseen lives intrigues us, sparks our imagination, and we see a lot of ourselves in them when we finally slow down enough to look. Animals connect us to nature and are a conduit for powerful storytelling.": "讲故事本身一直与自然联系在一起。动物作为神灵或类人主角的传说贯穿所有文化。美洲土著关于恶作剧精灵乌鸦的传说，中世纪寓言中的{@i Owl and the Nightingale}，或者像{@i Grimm's Fairy Tales}这样明显简单的事物，都是自然世界如何塑造故事叙述的例子。动物的神奇及其通常看不见的生活引起我们的好奇，激发我们的想象力，当我们最终放慢脚步去观察时，我们会在它们身上看到很多自己的影子。动物将我们与自然联系在一起，是强大故事叙述的媒介。",
	"This is why I believe roleplaying games have had such a resurgence in the past few years, because we're looking for a connection to the world around us. We're looking for a way to get away from screens, to forget about our complicated lives, and to live as heroes with problems we can solve, not just listen to on the news and worry about. We can help people, we can be heroes, and we have magic. Even in the imagination, these things are incredibly powerful.": "这就是为什么我相信角色扮演游戏在过去几年里如此复兴，因为我们正在寻找与我们周围世界的联系。我们想要摆脱屏幕，忘记我们复杂的生活，像英雄一样生活，解决我们可以解决的问题，而不仅仅是听新闻并担心。我们可以帮助人们，我们可以成为英雄，我们拥有魔法。即使在想象中，这些事情也是非常强大的。",
	"In Humblewood, we're going back to our roots as storytellers, using nature and the animals around us to adventure in a world of fantasy. We have so much technology surrounding us every day, getting out into nature isn't an option for many. Our jobs are time consuming, our lives are hard and complicated, our food is grown in places we will never see and sits on a shelf for our consumption wrapped in plastic. These things disconnect us from the story of nature, from the story of life and the changing of seasons and our connection to the world around us. In reality, even the humble pigeon has an interesting life, we just don't see it as we pass them on city streets without giving them a second look.": "在谦卑林，我们正在回归作为讲故事者的本质，利用大自然和周围的动物在一个幻想世界中冒险。我们每天被如此多的科技包围着，走进大自然对许多人来说根本不是一个选择。我们的工作耗时，我们的生活艰难复杂，我们的食物在我们永远看不到的地方生长，包装在塑料中放在货架上等待我们消费。这些事物使我们与大自然的故事、生命的故事、季节的更迭以及我们与周围世界的联系脱节。实际上，即使是那只不起眼的鸽子也有着有趣的生活，只是当我们在城市街道上路过它们时，并没有给予它们第二眼。",
	"I've loved birds since I can remember, they've always been how I connected to nature. I've rescued birds since I was 10 and I've worked with the smallest of hummingbirds to the massive moody, Red Tailed hawk named Ivan whose mew I cleaned in college. When I lived in Los Angeles, I began rescuing pigeons because they were everywhere, forgotten pets of colonists and invasive to the habitat they lived in. These birds were smart, funny, and ignored by almost every animal shelter you took them to. They were the lost and forgotten of the animal world, and that's why I fell in love with them. They had stories to tell, and every one of them has their own personality and quirks.": "我自小就喜欢鸟类，它们一直是我与大自然联系的方式。我从10岁起就开始救助鸟类，曾经与最小的蜂鸟一起工作，也曾与一只名叫伊万的脾气暴躁的红尾鹰合作，它是我在大学时期照顾的。当我住在洛杉矶时，我开始救助鸽子，因为它们无处不在，是殖民者遗忘的宠物，也是侵入性物种，破坏了它们所生活的栖息地。这些鸟类聪明幽默，几乎被每个动物收容所所忽视。它们是动物世界中的迷失与被遗忘者，这就是我爱上它们的原因。它们有故事要讲，每一只都有自己的个性和怪癖。",
	"Humans are not that different from animals. If we pay attention to them, we can understand them, save them, live with them, and honor them. The more compassion we have for animals the better our world will be. Telling their stories is just as important as telling our own, and helps us connect to and have compassion for the other creatures on our planet. So I encourage you to make your own legends in Humblewood, and then go to the forest and see them for yourself. Maybe they'll have a story of their own to tell you, too.": "人类并没有那么不同于动物。如果我们留心观察它们，我们就能理解它们，拯救它们，与它们共存，并尊重它们。我们对动物越有同情心，我们的世界就会变得更美好。讲述它们的故事和讲述我们自己的故事一样重要，这有助于我们与地球上其他生物建立联系并怀有同情心。因此，我鼓励你在谦卑森林中创造自己的传奇故事，然后去森林亲自见证。也许它们也有自己的故事要告诉你。",

	"When approaching the art direction for Humblewood, I wanted to express that this is a world full of vibrant, diverse characters, living in an expansive forest with a rich and intricate history. The driving force behind Humblewood as a concept was the desire to create a visually compelling world that felt alive, and that meant a world that could feel wonderful and welcoming, magical and mysterious. It also meant a world full of secrets, hidden dangers, and obstacles for a party of adventurers to overcome.": "在制定《谦木》的艺术指导时，我希望表达这是一个充满生机和多样性角色的世界，他们生活在一个历史悠久且复杂的广阔森林中。《谦木》背后的概念驱动力是希望创造一个视觉上引人入胜的世界，让人感觉它是活生生的，这意味着一个既美好又充满欢迎之感、又神奇又神秘的世界。这也意味着一个充满秘密、隐藏危险和障碍的世界，需要一队冒险者来克服。",
	"When I was young, the films and books I devoured with the most enthusiasm were the ones that appealed to audiences both young and old, whose characters may happen to be adorable woodland animals, but still bravely explored a mosaic of complex, confronting themes that we continue to puzzle over well into our adult years. These are the stories that left a significant impression on me, that I continue to revisit to this day.": "当我年轻的时候，我最热衷的电影和书籍是那些吸引了年轻和老年观众的作品，其中的角色可能是可爱的森林动物，但依然勇敢地探索了一系列复杂而具有挑战性的主题，这些主题我们在成年后依然在思考。这些故事给我留下了深刻的印象，我至今仍然会回顾这些作品。",
	"Roleplaying games are wonderful for many reasons, one being that they can provide a form of escape, or they can mirror reality. They can help us understand and process experiences in our own lives through an entirely different lens, and they give you a unique kind of freedom to be whoever or whatever you want to be, options for which there is no shortage in Humblewood—whether you are a sneaky mapach, a brave little strig, or a cunning corvum with a secret heart of gold, the only limit, as ever, is your imagination.": "角色扮演游戏有许多美妙之处，其中之一是它们可以提供一种逃避的形式，或者它们可以反映现实。它们可以帮助我们通过完全不同的视角理解和处理我们自己生活中的经历，并为你提供一种独特的自由，让你成为任何你想成为的人或事物，而在(`Humblewood`)中这样的选择是不胜枚举的——无论你是一个狡猾的(mapach)，一个勇敢的小(strig)，还是一个心怀金善的狡猾的(corvum)，唯一的限制，一如既往，是你的想象力。",
	"As artists we have to give careful consideration to every facet of the world, certainly the designs of our main characters and our myriad of monsters, but also what a character's home might look like, what kind of fabrics they might wear, and how should we design this bottle of vintage vulpin-crafted elderberry wine? We have illustrated forests flooded with beams of light, tangled and treacherous swamps you must battle your way through with determination, and cosy interiors where you can almost smell the jerbeen-sized loaves baking in the oven. The love is very often in the details, just as some of the most significant moments in a campaign can be the quiet ones, the small words exchanged at the campfire, or the tiny clues indicating a much larger mystery to unravel.": "作为艺术家，我们必须认真考虑世界的每一个方面，当然包括我们的主要角色和各种怪物的设计，还有一个角色的家可能是什么样子，他们可能穿什么样的衣服，以及我们应该如何设计这瓶古老的狐灵酿造的接骨草莓酒？我们描绘了被光束淹没的森林，你必须充满决心地穿越纠缠而危险的沼泽，以及舒适的室内，你几乎能闻到烤炉里烤着的杰宾大小的面包的味道。爱常常隐藏在细节中，就像一场冒险中一些最重要的时刻可能是安静的时刻，篝火旁交换的小词语，或者暗示着更大谜团的微小线索。",
	"Creating this project has been an unforgettable journey, full of as many surprises, twists and turns as the overgrown paths of Humblewood itself. I have had an affinity for nature and animals my entire life, which has been my primary source of inspiration for much of my personal work. I remember when I first sat down and sketched the first iteration of a brave little knight owl, who we have now named Riffin, and I could never have imagined in that moment how the idea behind this little owl would evolve into a fully realised world, lovingly crafted by our team of designers, writers and artists, for players to explore.": "创建这个项目是一段难忘的旅程，就像Humblewood本身那些长满杂草的小径一样，充满了许多惊喜、曲折和转折。我一直对大自然和动物有着亲近感，这一直是我个人作品的主要灵感来源。我还记得当我第一次坐下来草拟了一只勇敢的小骑士猫头鹰的初始版本，我们现在称之为Riffin，那时我无法想象这只小猫头鹰背后的想法会如何演变成一个由我们设计师、作家和艺术家团队精心打造、供玩家探索的完整世界。",
	"I am beyond excited for you all to take your first steps into this world, uncover some of its secrets during your adventures, experience its stories, and come away with many of your own stories to tell!": "我非常激动，期待你们迈出第一步进入这个世界，在冒险中揭开一些秘密，体验它的故事，并且带着许多属于你们自己的故事离开！",

	"In the far away world of Everden, on the eastern coast of a great continent, lies a vast forest nestled between the mountains and the sea. This is the Humblewood, an ancient and magical place that hums an endless song, sung to the Great Rhythm of life and death. The Wood, as it is known to its inhabitants, is not like any other forest. The trees are old and powerful, with rare specimens that reach as tall as small mountains. Here familiar beasts grow to unusual sizes, bearing markings and patterns unique to the Wood. This region is also home to two groups of animal-like humanoid races, the birdfolk and the humblefolk. Together they share the Wood and its bountiful resources.": "在遥远的埃弗登（Everden）世界上，位于一个伟大大陆的东海岸，有一片广袤的森林坐落在群山和大海之间。这就是谦卑森林（Humblewood），一个古老而神奇的地方，它吟唱着无尽的歌谣，奏响着生与死的伟大节奏。这片森林，被当地居民称为“Wood”，与其他森林不同。这里的树木古老而强大，稀有的树木甚至高达小山般高度。这里熟悉的野兽长得异常巨大，身上带有谦卑森林独有的纹饰和图案。这个地区还是两个动物般的类人种族的家园，分别是鸟人（birdfolk）和谦卑族（humblefolk）。它们共同分享着森林及其丰富的资源。",
	"In the early years, the birdfolk and humblefolk lived close to each other in small villages around the forest. These isolated communities were vulnerable to an organization of brigands and marauders who called themselves the \"Bandit Coalition.\" To protect themselves from the Coalition, the birdfolk built fortified cities in the forest's canopy. Joining forces with the humblefolk, the birdfolk army, known as the \"Perch Guard\", drove back the bandits, bringing peace and security to the region. Over time, birdfolk culture spread, and the capital city of Alderheart became the most politically influential place in the Wood.": "在早期，鸟人族和谦卑族居住在森林周围的小村庄里，彼此之间距离很近。这些与世隔绝的社区容易受到一个自称为“强盗联盟”的匪徒和掠夺者组织的威胁。为了保护自己免受联盟的侵害，鸟人族在森林的树冠中建造了设防城市。鸟人族军队与谦卑族联合起来，被称为“栖卫军”的鸟人族军队击退了强盗，为该地区带来了和平与安全。随着时间的推移，鸟人族文化传播开来，首都奥尔德哈特（Alderheart）成为了伍德地区最具政治影响力的地方。",
	"But the Wood has also known sorrow. Not long after the founding of Alderheart, a massive forest fire known as \"The Great Calamity\" burned a portion of the Wood. The origins of the fire are unknown, but it left the area permanently damaged. To this day, it is called the \"Scorched Grove,\" an arid field of ash that has since become home to many strange flame-infused creatures.": "但是这片森林也经历过悲伤。就在奥尔德哈特(Alderheart)建立不久之后，一场被称为“大灾难”的森林大火烧毁了一部分木头。火灾的起因不明，但它让这片地区永久受损。直到今天，它被称为“烧焦林地”，一片灰烬的干旱土地，后来成为许多奇怪的火焰生物的家园。",
	"The Tenders, an organization of druids and mystics, dedicate themselves to healing the Scorched Grove with natural magics. Set up in conclaves around the Wood, they provide aid whenever forest fires strike. Yet, since the Grove's burning, the Wood has known relatively few fires. Nature's balance, though, can be disrupted by a single spark.": "《招标者》(The Tenders)，一个由德鲁伊和秘术师组成的组织，致力于用自然魔法治愈被烧焦的林地。他们在整个森林周围建立了聚会点，每当森林发生火灾时，他们就会提供援助。然而，自从林地被烧毁以来，这片森林很少发生火灾。然而，大自然的平衡却可能被一根火花打破。",
	"Recently, fires have begun to rage through the Wood with a strength and fury not seen since ages past. Forest-dwellers are again being displaced from their homes, seeking refuge in Alderheart, and perch-dwellers are doing what they can to keep themselves safe up in their canopy sanctuaries. Relations between the humblefolk and birdfolk are tense. Moreover, a newly invigorated Bandit Coalition swells in numbers. Its sights are set upon Alderheart, where those displaced by the flames seek a means of survival.": "最近，自古以来罕见的烈焰席卷了（Wood）。森林居民再次被迫离开家园，寻求庇护在（Alderheart）之中，而栖息在树冠圣所的鸟类居民则竭尽所能保护自己的安全。谦卑族和鸟族之间的关系变得紧张。此外，一个新生的强盗联盟人数激增。他们的目标是（Alderheart），那里被火焰驱逐的人们正在寻求生存的途径。",
	"You are a citizen of the Wood, caught up in this turmoil. Or perhaps you are a storyteller from another world. Either way, the future of the Wood is yours to write. Within this book you will find all the tools you need to build your character, travel the land, and create your own Humblewood story.": "你是木之国的一名公民，卷入了这场动荡。或许你是来自另一个世界的故事讲述者。无论如何，木之国的未来由你来书写。在这本书中，你会找到所有需要的工具，来塑造你的角色，游历这片土地，并创作属于你自己的《谦木之国》故事。",
	"Whether or not Humblewood is able to survive the flames is up to you. Go forth and adventure! Only you can restore balance to the Wood.": "是否谦卑森林能够幸存下来取决于你。前往冒险吧！只有你能够恢复森林的平衡。",
	"The various folk who make up the world of Humblewood are divided into two categories: the birdfolk and the humblefolk. While they resemble animals, the folk who inhabit the cities, towns, and villages of Humblewood are all humanoids.": "组成《谦林》世界的各种民族分为两类：鸟人族和谦人族。虽然他们看起来像动物，但居住在《谦林》城市、镇和村庄中的民族都是类人生物。",
	"This chapter outlines the ten core races, five birdfolk and five humblefolk, who make up the majority of characters found in the Wood. It also details various character creation options, new class options, backgrounds, feats, and spells to help you make your own Humblewood adventurer.": "这一章概述了十个核心种族，包括五个鸟人和五个谦卑族，他们构成了森林中大多数角色的基础。它还详细介绍了各种角色创建选项，新的职业选项，背景，特长和法术，以帮助您打造自己的《谦卑森林》冒险者。",
	"The birdfolk races of Humblewood are as diverse and unique as the forest itself. Only the skillful survive the forest, and the birdfolk have become masters of both the forest floor and the canopies above, creating several settlements (known colloquially as \"perches\") throughout the Wood. Despite regional differences and cultural peculiarities among the different kinds of birdfolk in the Wood, the birdfolk races nevertheless share much of their culture, language, history, and origin myths. This solidarity has allowed them to work together and prosper, creating a harmony in the Wood which has lasted for an age.": "《Humblewood(谦木)》中的鸟人种族与森林本身一样多样且独特。只有熟练的人才能在森林中生存，而鸟人已经成为了森林地面和树冠之上的大师，他们在整个谦木中建立了几个定居点（俗称“栖所”）。尽管在谦木中不同种类的鸟人之间存在地区差异和文化特点，但鸟人种族仍然分享着许多文化、语言、历史和起源神话。这种团结使他们能够共同努力，繁荣发展，创造了谦木中持续了一个时代的和谐。",
	"While a diverse group, adapted for a variety of environments within the Wood, birdfolk also share several physical traits which have allowed them to find common ground in the construction of their perches. Beyond the obvious physical similarities, all birdfolk possess arms covered in feathers, which extend into wing-like appendages. While incapable of true powered flight, the strong hollow bones and lightweight bodies of birdfolk allow them to easily use their feathered arms to glide, and unless severely encumbered, all birdfolk can recover gracefully from what would otherwise be a deadly fall. In some birdfolk races these wings have grown strong enough to bear their owners upwards in a mighty flap, while others instead developed talons which make for both deadly defensive weapons and useful tools for scaling tall trees.": "虽然是一个多样化的群体，适应了木林中各种环境的鸟人也分享了几个身体特征，这些特征使他们在搭建栖息地时能够找到共同点。除了明显的身体相似之外，所有的鸟人都有长满羽毛的手臂，延伸成翼状附肢。虽然不能进行真正的动力飞行，但鸟人强壮的空心骨骼和轻盈的身体使他们能够轻松地利用羽毛覆盖的手臂滑翔，除非受到严重阻碍，所有的鸟人都能从本应是致命的坠落中优雅地恢复。在一些鸟人种族中，这些翅膀已经变得足够强壮，可以让它们的主人在一次强有力的拍打中上升，而其他一些种族则发展出了爪子，既是致命的防御武器，也是攀爬高大树木的有用工具。",
	"The birdfolk have established themselves as a political force to be reckoned with in Humblewood. They shaped their mighty capital from the great tree Alderheart, and from this bastion of safety their ruling body, the Birdfolk Council, makes decisions which impact all of Humblewood. The birdfolk are well-defended from outside threats thanks to the Perch Guard, a force of soldiers trained in both aerial and ground combat, that keeps their cities and the denizens within safe.": "鸟人已经在（Humblewood）中确立了自己作为一个不可忽视的政治力量。他们将自己强大的首都塑造成了伟大的树木（Alderheart），而从这个安全的堡垒中，他们的统治机构，即鸟人议会，制定了影响整个（Humblewood）的决策。鸟人得到了充分的防御，多亏了（Perch Guard），这是一支受过空中和地面战斗训练的士兵力量，他们保护着城市和其中的居民。",
	"While Alderheart has been a beacon of peace and harmony for many years, the coming of the fires has thrown the region into chaos. The Perch Guard forces are spread thin across the canopy cities, barely able to secure the main roads for merchants while keeping their homes safe from the blazes. Now the great birdfolk cities face more threats from bandits and forest fires than ever before. Through it all, though, the birdfolk trust in solidarity, between themselves and the diverse groups of habitants who call their perches home, to weather the coming storm as they have so many times before.": "尽管多年来奥尔德哈特一直是和平与和谐的象征，但火灾的到来使该地区陷入混乱。栖木卫队的力量在天篷城市间分散，勉强能够保护主要道路供商人通行，同时又要确保他们的家园免受火灾的侵袭。如今，伟大的鸟人城市面临比以往更多的来自强盗和森林火灾的威胁。然而，在这一切之中，鸟人们仍然信任团结，他们之间以及与各种居民群体之间的团结，就像他们以前那样度过即将到来的风暴。",
	"Not all denizens of Humblewood are birdfolk. The term \"humblefolk\" is used throughout the Wood to refer to the non-birdfolk peoples who live a little closer to the forest floor. Unlike the birdfolk, whose shared language, histories, myths, and culture have allowed them to exist in harmony for most of Humblewood's history, the humblefolk represent a disparate group of peoples, cultures, and ways of seeing the world, many of whom haven't always seen eye to eye.": "在谦卑森林（Humblewood）并非所有居民都是鸟类。术语“谦卑民（humblefolk）”在整个森林中用来指代那些生活在离森林地面更近的非鸟类族群。与鸟类不同，鸟类共同的语言、历史、神话和文化使他们在谦卑森林的大部分历史中能够和谐共存。而谦卑民代表了一个不同的族群、文化和世界观，许多人并不总是能够达成一致。",
	"Ages ago, an accord was struck between the people of the forest floor to unite against roving bandits and quell the in-fighting that was wreaking havoc across the Wood. This accord was known as the \"Humblefolk Treaty\" and was witnessed by the birdfolk, who were just then beginning to shape the trunk of Alderheart. The birdfolk offered the humblefolk safety within their great city, and many accepted their offer. Over time, more and more humblefolk migrated to newly-established birdfolk perches, though many found birdfolk architecture to be restrictive for creatures without wings. In the same way, some groups of birdfolk, feeling too crowded within the booming perches, began to spread out and seek shelter within small woodland villages. Even today, the birdfolk who choose to live on the forest floor find themselves stigmatized, as a life in the canopy is considered proper in birdfolk society.": "很久以前，森林地面的居民之间达成了一项协议，团结起来对抗流窜的强盗，平息横行的内讧，这些内讧给整个木林带来了灾难。这个协议被称为“谦卑族条约”，并由鸟人见证，当时他们正开始塑造奥德哈特的树干。鸟人向谦卑族提供了在他们伟大城市内的安全，许多人接受了他们的提议。随着时间的推移，越来越多的谦卑族移居到新建立的鸟人栖息地，尽管许多人发现鸟人的建筑对于没有翅膀的生物来说有所限制。同样，一些鸟人群体在繁荣的栖息地内感到过于拥挤，开始散居并寻求庇护在小型林地村庄内。即使在今天，选择生活在森林地面上的鸟人发现自己受到污名化，因为在鸟人社会中，生活在树冠中被认为是合适的。",
	"After the establishment of the treaty, humblefolk began to live once again in small woodland villages beneath the trees, although now in more diverse communities alongside some ground-dwelling birdfolk. With the expansion of the Humblefolk Treaty to allow humblefolk to call upon Perch Guard garrisons in times of crisis, and the birdfolk militias keeping the roads safe for merchant caravans, the Wood truly entered a golden age. Life for many humblefolk was peaceful and prosperous...until the fires came.": "在条约签订后，(`Humblefolk`) 谦逊族群开始重新居住在树下的小木村庄中，尽管现在他们与一些地面鸟族一起生活在更多样化的社区中。随着(`Humblefolk Treaty`) 谦逊族条约的扩展，使谦逊族在危机时可以请求(`Perch Guard`) 栖木卫队的驻守，以及鸟族民兵保护商队安全通行，(`the Wood`) 木之地真正进入了黄金时代。许多谦逊族的生活是和平繁荣的...直到大火的到来。",
	"With the spreading flames, humblefolk villagers petitioned the overextended Perch Guard for aid, only to see help arrive too late, if at all. To make matters worse, after many years the divisions between the humblefolk communities have intensified: those who found prosperity in the birdfolk cities have adopted a perch-dweller's perspective, while those who live in the woodlands face a constant threat from brigands and forest fires. Others have even left to join the newly reformed Bandit Coalition, seeing not only a path for survival, but a chance to get even with the perch-dwelling birdfolk for broken oaths and unequal treatment. Yet, where the treaty holds, vibrant humblefolk communities can still be found. The humblefolk are resilient, and each race will devise a way to survive in this dangerous wood.": "随着烈焰蔓延，普通村民向过度延伸的栖巢卫士请求援助，却往往见到援助来得太迟，甚至根本没有。更糟糕的是，多年来，普通人社区之间的分歧加剧：那些在鸟人城市中找到繁荣的人采纳了栖巢居民的观点，而那些生活在林地中的人则面临着强盗和森林火灾的持续威胁。还有一些人甚至离开加入了新近改组的强盗联盟，他们不仅看到了生存的途径，还看到了与栖巢鸟人为破坏誓言和不公平对待报复的机会。然而，在条约有效的地方，依然可以找到充满活力的普通人社区。普通人是坚韧的，每个种族都会想出一种在这片危险的森林中生存的方法。",
	"This chapter outlines how you can customize your character, everything from physical characteristics, backgrounds, class options, feats, and spells, all in keeping with the flavor of Humblewood.": "本章概述了如何定制你的角色，从外貌特征、背景、职业选项、特征和法术等方面，所有内容都与《谦木》的风格保持一致。",
	"Your character is more than just a collection of rules. Here are a few tools to help you flesh out the look and feel of your character.": "你的角色不仅仅是一堆规则的集合。以下是一些工具，可以帮助你充实角色的外观和感觉。",
	"The sex or gender of a character doesn't confer any special bonuses or penalties. Playable races do not exhibit physical characteristics based on sex, and traits such as plumage, markings, and size difference are not associated with a specific sex or gender.

	"You may notice that the weights for birdfolk races are significantly lower than for humblefolk of similar size. The birdfolk have hollow bones, reinforced by special internal structures that act as struts. Along with other weight-reducing adaptations, this allows birdfolk to glide. Birdfolk characters are not negatively impacted by their lower weight.": "你可能会注意到，与相似体型的普通人种相比，鸟类种族的体重明显较轻。鸟类种族有空心骨，通过特殊的内部结构加固，作为支撑结构。除了其他减重适应性之外，这使得鸟类种族能够滑翔。鸟类角色不会因为体重较轻而受到负面影响。",

Players can adjust these sizes depending on the kind of birdfolk or humblefolk character they'd like to play. Some varieties of strig, a race that takes their physical characteristics from owls, could be smaller sized, around 3 feet tall, if desired. Similarly, raptors, a race whose physical characteristics resemble birds of prey, could reach around 5 feet in height. For the sake of simplicity we advise that, regardless of the physical measurements of a character, they follow the size category rules of their race (Medium or Small). In the lore, this can be expressed by saying that even a small strig is solid and strong, where even a taller raptor is light and agile. This will make calculating things that rely on size categories much easier, rather than having to remember which size variant a player has chosen for a race.": "在种族描述中列出的尺寸代表各种种族的建议平均值。玩家可以根据他们想扮演的鸟人或谦卑人物角色的种类来调整这些尺寸。如果需要，一些取自猫头鹰的外貌特征的种族strig可能会较小，大约3英尺高。同样地，猛禽这个种族，其外貌特征类似猛禽鸟类，可能达到约5英尺高。为了简化起见，我们建议，无论角色的实际尺寸如何，他们应遵循其种族的大小类别规则（中等或小型）。在传说中，这可以通过说即使是一个小的strig也是坚固而强壮的，即使是一个较高的猛禽也是轻盈而敏捷的来表达。这将使依赖于大小类别的事物的计算变得更加容易，而不是要记住玩家为种族选择了哪种尺寸变体。",
	"Alternatively, if the races presented here are too big when placed in comparison to humans in other campaign settings, size categories can be adjusted accordingly. This is entirely a matter of taste. It is recommended to do whatever makes the most sense for the kinds of worlds you'd like to build and the kinds of stories you'd like to tell.": "另外，如果这里介绍的种族与其他战役设置中的人类相比太大，尺寸类别可以相应调整。这完全是品味问题。建议根据您想打造的世界和讲述的故事来做出最合理的调整。",

While not every cervan has horns, the ability to grow them is seen as a blessing of Cairith, and is a part of their culture.": "Cervan（狩鹿人）角色可以想象成麋鹿、驼鹿或羚羊。任何有角的有蹄动物都可以胜任，尤其是那些生活在森林或山地环境中的动物。虽然并非每个狩鹿人都有角，但能够长角被视为凯瑞斯（Cairith）的祝福，也是他们文化的一部分。",
	"Birds which are known for their dark coloration, such as crows, blackbirds and grackles, would be a good visual fit. Despite typically being dark-feathered, a variety of colorful corvids exist. Jays, nutcrackers, and jackdaws are good examples.": "以乌鸦、黑鸟和乌鸦为代表的以深色羽毛而闻名的鸟类，会是一个很好的视觉搭配。尽管通常羽毛较暗，但也存在着各种多彩的鸦科鸟类。松鸦、喜鹊和寒鸦就是很好的例子。",
	"No matter which type of bird is being used for visual inspiration for your corvum, it is important that they have at least one black feather. Black feathers on a corvum are known as the \"Mark of Gesme\" and they are thought to impart some of Gesme's reckless curiosity.": "无论用什么类型的鸟作为你的科尔温（Corvum）的视觉灵感，重要的是它们至少有一根黑色羽毛。科尔温上的黑色羽毛被称为“盖斯姆之印”（Mark of Gesme），据说它们传达了盖斯姆（Gesme）的一些鲁莽好奇心。",
	"Gallus characters are usually represented by land fowl of all kinds, ranging from those with small rounded bodies, suited to ground life, to those with longer proportions. Waterfowl, such as ducks or geese, could be used as visual inspiration for communities of gallus living by Humblewood's wetlands. Other fowl, such as peacocks, could also be used. While not closely-related to fowl, herons, storks, and bitterns could be a good reference for taller, marshland-dwelling communities of gallus.": "Gallus（鸡人）角色通常由各种陆地家禽代表，包括那些适合生活在地面上的小圆胖体型的家禽，以及那些比例较长的家禽。水禽，如鸭子或鹅，可以作为灵感来源，用于描述生活在Humblewood湿地的鸡人社区。其他家禽，如孔雀，也可以使用。虽然与家禽不太相关，但苍鹭、鹳和苦恶鸟可以作为更高大、栖息在沼泽地的鸡人社区的良好参考。",
	"Gallus characters with ostentatious, colorful plumage are generally better suited to the bright gallus subrace, while those with modest, earth-toned feathers might be better suited to the huden gallus subrace.": "那些羽毛华丽、色彩斑斓的Gallus角色通常更适合明亮的Gallus亚种，而那些羽毛朴素、泥土色调的可能更适合于Huden Gallus亚种。",
	"While inspired by hedgehogs, having a hedge character based on a quilled animal that inhabits forests, such as a porcupine, would also make sense. Although they would probably not be native to Humblewood, armadillos, pangolins, or echidnas would also work.": "受刺猬启发，创作一个基于栖息在森林中的刺毛动物（porcupine）的刺猬角色也是有道理的。尽管它们可能不是Humblewood的本地物种，但犰狳、穿山甲或针鼹也是可以的。",
	"The jerbeens are inspired by jerboas, a kind of jumping mouse. Other small rodents with mouse-like proportions, including chinchillas, could be used for visual inspiration as well. Though a greater stretch, the jerbeen's speed, size, and communal way of life would make them an ideal analog for races based on rabbits or hares.": "杰比恩人(jerbeens)的灵感来自跳鼠(jerboas)，一种跳跃的老鼠。其他具有老鼠般体型的小啮齿动物，包括栗鼠(chinchillas)，也可以用作视觉灵感。虽然有些牵强，但杰比恩人的速度、体型和群居方式使它们成为基于兔子或野兔的种族的理想类比。",
	"Lumas are inspired by doves and pigeons, but their size and high charisma means that small songbirds such as chickadees, wrens, sparrows, and cardinals would also be a good fit. A bird-of-paradise could be used as well due to their focus on performance, though they might be better suited for visitors to Humblewood from more tropical regions. Birds with brighter or more decorative plumage would correspond to sera lumas, while those with more muted feathers would be better as sable lumas.": "卢玛（Lumas）的灵感来源于鸽子和鸽子，但它们的体积和高颜值意味着小型鸟类，如山雀、鹪鹩、麻雀和红衣主教也很合适。由于它们注重表现，所以也可以使用天堂鸟，尽管它们可能更适合来自更热带地区的谦卑森林的访客。羽毛更亮丽或更装饰性的鸟类对应于塞拉卢玛（sera lumas），而羽毛更暗淡的鸟类更适合作为萨布尔卢玛（sable lumas）。",
	"Inspired by raccoons, mapach characters can reference members of the weasel family, such as ferrets and badgers. Mapachs are hearty and crafty, and possess a climbing speed, which means many members of this family, including polecats, would be good fits.": "受浣熊启发，(`Mapach`)马帕奇角色可以参考黄鼬科的成员，如雪貂和獾。马帕奇们强壮而狡猾，拥有攀爬速度，这意味着包括臭鼬在内的这个家族的许多成员都很合适。",
	"Raptors take after smaller birds of prey, like falcons and hawks, but using larger species, like eagles or vultures as a reference would also work for raptor characters. Maran raptors could also take visual inspiration from seabirds, notably petrels or shearwaters, due to their swim speed.": "猛禽类生物通常以猎鹰和鹰类为蓝本，但也可以参考更大的物种，如雕或秃鹫，来塑造猛禽角色。马兰猛禽也可以从海鸟中汲取视觉灵感，尤其是海燕或鹱，因为它们擅长游泳。",
	"Strigs usually resemble owls of all kinds. Owls comprise a very large and diverse family of birds, and examples can be found which are small, large, or unique in appearance. For larger, more intimidating strigs, the great gray owl or giant scops owl can provide a robust presence, while smaller strigs could take inspiration from the little owl, or boreal owl. Regardless of their size, stout strigs tend to be bulkier, with denser feathers, while swift strigs have more slender and streamlined bodies.": "Strigs（Strigs）通常类似于各种猫头鹰。猫头鹰是一个非常庞大且多样化的鸟类家族，可以找到各种大小或外观独特的例子。对于更大更令人畏惧的Strigs，可以从大灰猫头鹰或巨角鸮中获得强大的存在感，而较小的Strigs可以从小猫头鹰或北极猫头鹰中获得灵感。无论大小，粗壮的Strigs往往更加笨重，羽毛更加浓密，而敏捷的Strigs则拥有更加纤细和流线型的身体。",
	"Vulpins generally look like foxes, but an alternative visual reference would be wolves, coyotes, or other hunting canines that could be commonly found in a forest environment. Vulpins should be represented as wild animals, to illustrate the duality of their sophisticated yet savage nature. Breeds of tamed dogs would not be a good fit.": "狐狸族（Vulpins）通常看起来像狐狸，但另一种视觉参考可能是狼、郊狼或其他常见于森林环境中的狩猎犬类。狐狸族应被描绘为野生动物，以展示它们复杂而野蛮本性的双重性。驯养狗的品种不适合。",
	"Race determines the language your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional language of your choice. You are free to select these from among the languages offered in other 5e material, but there are several languages which are specific to the Wood.": "种族决定了角色默认可以说的语言，而背景可能会让你选择一种或多种额外的语言。你可以从其他5e材料提供的语言中自由选择，但有一些语言是特定于Wood的。",
	"The standard languages listed below are part of common life in Humblewood, and are spoken widely. Sylvan, along with various dialects of Primordial (Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran) are uncommon languages known only by few in the Wood, but they can prove exceptionally useful in communicating with the various fey and elemental Humblewood residents.": "以下列出的标准语言是Humblewood常见生活的一部分，并被广泛使用。 Sylvan，以及各种原初语言的方言（Auran，Aquan，Ignan和Terran）是Wood中仅少数人知晓的不常见语言，但在与各种精灵和元素Humblewood居民交流时，它们可能会被证明非常有用。",
	"Each birdfolk race possesses a unique and mystical connection to the element of air, which allows them to understand Auran from birth, although they are unable to speak it naturally. Birdfolk who wish to become fluent in this dialect must take the time to learn. Because Auran is a dialect of Primordial, birdfolk innately understand Aquan, Ignan, and Terran as well, though not perfectly. Compared to Auran, the other dialects of Primordial sound stilted or broken to birdfolk. While they can understand simple concepts presented in these dialects, more complicated matters are lost in translation.": "每个飞禽种族都拥有与空气元素独特而神秘的联系，这使得他们从出生起就能理解风语，尽管他们无法自然地说出来。希望流利掌握这种方言的飞禽必须花时间学习。因为风语是原初语的一种方言，飞禽天生就能理解水语、火语和土语，尽管不是完美的。与风语相比，其他原初语的方言在飞禽听来显得生硬或断断续续。虽然他们能理解这些方言中呈现的简单概念，但更复杂的问题则会在翻译中失去意义。",
	"Birdfolk takes the place of Common in Humblewood. As the language of trade and custom, folk of the Wood take the time to learn it. Other 5e races who choose to visit Humblewood will want to know Birdfolk. Likewise, birdfolk or humblefolk characters visiting other lands should add Common to their language list.": "鸟人族（Birdfolk）在（Humblewood）中取代了普通语（Common）的位置。作为贸易和习俗的语言，森林中的人们会花时间学习它。其他5e种族选择访问（Humblewood）的人会想了解鸟人族。同样，鸟人族或（Humblewood）角色访问其他地方时应该将普通语（Common）添加到他们的语言列表中。",

Birdfolk can be written quickly with a quill, or scratched easily with a claw, and has been widely adopted throughout the Wood.": "鸟人族（Birdfolk）是一种以咔哒声、乌鸦声和口哨声为特点的语言。尽管主要是口头传播，但在奥尔德哈特（Alderheart）建立之前很久就已经发展出了一种用象形文字书写鸟人族语言的系统，后来演变成了一套代表不同声音的抽象字形。鸟人族语言可以用羽毛快速书写，也可以用爪子轻松刻画，并且已经被广泛采用在整个森林中。",
	"Cervan is a complex language with no written script. It is seen as disrespectful to try and transcribe it using Birdfolk characters.

	"In the beginning, there was only the sound of wings. Faint at first, the distant beats were easy to miss, but as time passed they grew stronger, faster, until they could be heard across the great unending dark. Then, with a single flap, creation burst forth: fire, ice, air, water, soil and sky, all came from the sound of feathers that resonated throughout the cosmos. This is the Great Rhythm, and by the Great Rhythm are all things moved. The Rhythm tells the sun when to set, and the moon when to rise. The Rhythm tells the seeds when to flower, the trees when to shed their leaves, and the snows when to fall. The essence of everything there is comes from the Great Rhythm. One day, the Rhythm may cue the end of creation—but there will be no end to the Rhythm itself. As every downbeat has an upbeat to follow it, so too will the cycles of nature eventually start again—for even though the Rhythm can be faint at times, it is everlasting and eternal.": "起初，只有翅膀的声音。一开始微弱得几乎可以被忽略，但随着时间的推移，这些遥远的拍打声变得越来越强烈、更快，直到可以在无尽的黑暗中传播开来。然后，随着一翅膀的振动，创造爆发了：火、冰、空气、水、土壤和天空，所有这些都源自于那些在整个宇宙中回响的羽毛声音。这就是伟大的节奏，万物皆由伟大的节奏所驱动。节奏告诉太阳何时落下，月亮何时升起。节奏告诉种子何时开花，树木何时落叶，雪何时降临。一切事物的本质都源自于伟大的节奏。也许有一天，节奏会预示着创世的终结——但节奏本身永远不会终结。正如每一个低音都有一个高音跟随一样，自然的循环最终会重新开始——因为即使节奏有时会微弱，它却是永恒不朽的。",
	"Every denizen of the forest, from the large to the small, from predator to prey, knows of The Great Rhythm: the beating force that is the pulse of life itself. To the birdfolk, the Rhythm began with the sound of beating wings, but other folk of the Wood tell that it began with the thundering of hooves, the padding of paws, or with a tiny heartbeat. Birdfolk believe that two great spirits emerged from the Rhythm. They were the first Amaranthine: Ardea, whose wings usher in the dawn, and Tyton, whose wings are the shadow of night. They are the avatars of life and death, and keepers of the Rhythm.": "每一个森林居民，从大到小，从捕食者到猎物，都知道“大律动”：那是生命脉搏的跳动力量。对于鸟人来说，律动始于翅膀拍打的声音，但森林中的其他种族却说它始于马蹄的轰鸣，爪子的踏击，或者微小的心跳声。鸟人相信从律动中诞生了两位伟大的精灵。他们是第一位不朽者：阿尔迪亚(Ardea)，她的翅膀引领黎明，以及泰顿(Tyton)，他的翅膀是夜晚的阴影。他们是生与死的化身，是律动的守护者。",
	"Just as we need a heart to make our pulse pound, so too does the Rhythm require a drummer. The heart of the Rhythm lies within the Amaranthine. They are the immortals, who have been given new life by the Rhythm, and act as its guardians, maintaining the balance of nature.": "就像我们需要心脏来让我们的脉搏跳动一样，节奏也需要一个鼓手。节奏的核心在于(Amaranthine)。他们是不朽者，通过节奏获得了新生命，并充当其守护者，维持自然的平衡。",
	"The Amaranthine are the gods of Everden. They are entrusted with maintaining the cosmic balance known as the Great Rhythm. Unlike gods in other settings, the Amaranthine rarely squabble with one another, for any strife between the Amaranthine is a threat to the balance of nature itself. The Amaranthine tend to keep to themselves, and rarely meddle in each other's affairs.": "永恒者(`The Amaranthine`)是埃弗登(`Everden`)的众神。他们被委托维持被称为大律动(`the Great Rhythm`)的宇宙平衡。与其他设定中的神明不同，永恒者很少争吵，因为永恒者之间的任何冲突都是对自然平衡的威胁。永恒者倾向于独来独往，很少干涉彼此的事务。",
	"Though each Amaranthine is a powerful being in their own right, holding a great degree of autonomy over their dominion, each understands that they are but a small part of a greater whole. Like the themes of a concerto, the Amaranthine are the harmonies that create the Great Rhythm.": "尽管每个(Amaranthine)都是自己的强大存在，在其领地上拥有很大的自治权，但每个都明白他们只是更大整体的一小部分。就像协奏曲的主题一样，(Amaranthine)是创造大节奏的和谐音。",
	"The Amaranthine are venerated by all races of Humblewood, although birdfolk and humblefolk worship them differently. The five whose origins are described in the \"Tales of the Amaranthine\" (Altus, Clhuran, Gesme, Reya, and Hanera), are primarily worshiped by birdfolk, and they (along with Ardea and Tyton) form the most common pantheon worshiped across the Wood.": "所有种族的Humblewood都尊崇不朽者(Amaranthine)，尽管鸟人和谦卑族以不同方式崇拜他们。在《不朽者传说》(Altus, Clhuran, Gesme, Reya, 和 Hanera)中描述起源的五位主要受到鸟人的崇拜，他们(与Ardea和Tyton一起)组成了整个森林中最常见的神祇群。",

	"The humblefolk Amaranthine are less cohesive, with each having varied tales, origin myths, rather than a single origin story. Many fables are told of the humblefolk Amaranthine, such as the time Kren tricked Gesme into dropping her flaming staff to flush game out of a bush, or when Henwin sheltered Gaspard from a great monster.": "谦逊的阿玛兰辛人缺乏凝聚力，每个人都有各种传说和起源神话，而不是一个单一的起源故事。许多寓言讲述了谦逊的阿玛兰辛人，比如克伦欺骗盖斯梅让她丢下燃烧的手杖来赶出灌木丛中的猎物，或者亨温庇护加斯帕德免受一只巨大怪兽的伤害。",
	"To humblefolk who live outside of birdfolk perches, Ardea and Tyton are known as Dawnmother and Nightfather.

	"While these Amaranthine go largely overlooked by most birdfolk, some who have taken the time to learn their legends pay homage to the featherless Amaranthine. This bothers a few humblefolk, but the priests of these Amaranthine understand that each one is but a reflection of the Great Rhythm, and welcome any birdfolk to learn from them.": "虽然大多数鸟人对这些不起眼的不凋花(Amaranthine)视而不见，但一些花时间了解它们传说的人会向这些无羽的不凋花(Amaranthine)致敬。这让一些谦逊的人感到不安，但这些不凋花(Amaranthine)的祭司明白每一个都只是大节奏的一种反映，并欢迎任何鸟人向它们学习。",

	"With the birth of Ardea and Tyton, the world was set into motion. Where once there was nothing but barrens, the land came alive with the coming of the Amaranthine, and the world began its endless cycle of life and death. Their arrival split the formless sky into day and night. They created the sun and the moon, and the succession of light and dark which emerged from their movement across the heavens told all life when to act and when to rest. Ardea and Tyton were born from opposite parts of the Great Rhythm. Each knows of the other's existence, but they keep to their separate spheres, meeting only in the early hours of dawn and the late hours of dusk to exchange dominion over the sky. In seasons of warmth, Ardea has a greater reign over the sky, while in seasons of bitter cold, Tyton's power increases.": "随着Ardea(阿尔迪亚)和Tyton(泰顿)的诞生，世界开始运转。曾经一片荒凉的土地因为Amaranthine(阿玛兰辛)的到来而变得生机勃勃，世界开始了无尽的生死轮回。他们的到来将无形的天空分成了白昼和黑夜。他们创造了太阳和月亮，而这些光明和黑暗的交替随着它们在天空中的运行告诉所有生命何时行动，何时休息。Ardea(阿尔迪亚)和Tyton(泰顿)诞生于大律动的相反部分。他们彼此知晓对方的存在，但各自守护着自己的领域，只在黎明初现和黄昏将至时交换对天空的统治权。在温暖的季节，Ardea(阿尔迪亚)对天空有更大的统治权，而在寒冷的季节，Tyton(泰顿)的力量增强。",

	"Originally, all birdfolk were the same. It was difficult to distinguish them from the birds of the forest, as they even possessed the ability to fly. One day, the entire flock of birdfolk decided on a grand contest of gift-giving, to prove which of them was the most worthy to lead. Ardea agreed to act as judge; whoever could present her with the greatest gift would become leaders among her children. For an entire season, birdfolk searched and scrounged, gathered and hunted, returning with trinkets, baubles, gifts great and small. Though Ardea commended all her children for their gifts, only five were truly deserving of her boon.": "最初，所有的鸟人都是一样的。很难将它们与森林中的鸟类区分开来，因为它们甚至拥有飞行的能力。有一天，整群的鸟人决定举行一场盛大的馈赠比赛，以证明谁最值得领导。阿尔迪亚同意担任裁判；凡是能给她呈现最伟大礼物的人将成为她孩子们中的领袖。整个季节，鸟人们搜寻、搜刮，收集和狩猎，带回各种小玩意、小装饰品、大小礼物。尽管阿尔迪亚赞赏她所有孩子的礼物，但只有五个真正值得她的恩惠。",
	"Gesme, Reya, Hanera, Altus, and Clhuran: these five became leaders of the birdfolk. They inspired tales, devotion, and gave the birdfolk races their distinct forms and skills. These great ones went on to become part of the Great Rhythm as keepers of nature's balance and protectors of birdfolk across Everden, eventually ascending and joining the Amaranthine. The followers of each of the five were granted new forms and great gifts, to match their leader's exploits. Yet, to accept these gifts, something needed to be lost. This is why the birdfolk of today can only glide: their gift of flight was taken as the price for becoming something new.": "盖斯梅 (Gesme), 瑞亚 (Reya), 哈涅拉 (Hanera), 阿尔图斯 (Altus), 和 克卢兰 (Clhuran)：这五位成为了鸟人的领袖。他们激发了传说、虔诚，并赋予了鸟人种族独特的形态和技能。这些伟大的存在继续成为大律动的一部分，作为自然平衡的守护者和整个埃弗登鸟人的保护者，最终升入并加入了不朽者 (Amaranthine)。每位五位领袖的追随者都被赋予了新的形态和伟大的礼物，以匹配他们领袖的壮举。然而，为了接受这些礼物，必须牺牲一些东西。这就是为什么如今的鸟人只能滑翔：他们的飞行之赐被拿走，作为成为新事物的代价。",
	"The first to present Ardea with a worthy gift was Gesme, a clever birdfolk who saw potential in the world that her kin could scarcely imagine. She had observed the great orb of fire that Ardea had placed high in the sky, and how Ardea had positioned it a great distance from the land and its creatures, so it would warm them gently without burning them. But Gesme also saw that the sun vanished with the coming of night, when the creatures of the dark began to prowl, and thought: \"How remarkable would it be to have some of that fire in the world?\"": "第一个给亚瑞迪亚带来一份有价值的礼物的是格斯梅(Gesme)，一个聪明的鸟人，她看到了世界中她的同类难以想象的潜力。她观察到亚瑞迪亚放在天空中的巨大火球，以及亚瑞迪亚将其放置在离大地和生物很远的地方，这样它就可以温和地温暖它们而不会烧伤它们。但格斯梅也看到太阳在夜幕降临时消失了，黑暗生物开始徘徊，她想：“如果世界上有一些那种火焰，那将是多么了不起啊。”",
	"Other birdfolk laughed at Gesme as she spent days plotting, and reading the sky. She examined every tree, from the great ash to the supple willow. Each day she carried a new branch in her beak, dropping many in frustration. The birdfolk were puzzled, but dismissed her actions. Then, one day at dawn, when the sun was at its lowest point in the sky, Gesme appeared with an oak branch in her beak. Without a word, she took off straight into the horizon. She flew for what seemed like ages, but the oak branch was light and did not trouble her. As she neared the sun her feathers, talons, and beak began to blacken in the heat. Still, she persisted. The oak was hardy and spry, and did not wither. Finally, she stuck the tip of the branch into the sun, igniting it. Hastily she flew back toward the ground, with the branch burning bright in her talons. The oak was patient, and did not burn up, keeping the flame steady as Gesme returned from the sky.": "在当地语言习惯的基础上，鸟人们嘲笑着格斯梅，因为她花了几天时间策划并观察天空。她检查了每棵树，从巨大的白蜡树到柔软的柳树。每天她都用嘴叼着一根新树枝，但在沮丧中掉落了许多。鸟人们感到困惑，但对她的行为不以为意。然后，在一个清晨，当太阳在天空中的最低点时，格斯梅叼着一根橡树树枝出现了。她没有说话，径直朝着地平线飞去。她飞了似乎很长时间，但橡树树枝很轻，没有困扰她。当她接近太阳时，她的羽毛、爪子和嘴开始因热而变黑。然而，她仍然坚持不懈。橡树坚韧而有活力，并没有枯萎。最后，她将树枝的尖端插入太阳，点燃了它。匆忙间，她带着燃烧明亮的树枝飞回地面。橡树很耐心，没有燃烧殆尽，保持着火焰稳定，当格斯梅从天空返回时。",
	"\"See what I have brought here!\" she bragged, as the astounded birdfolk looked upon her scorched feathers. \"This will keep us warm on the cold days of winter, and safe through the long nights!\"": "\"看看我带来了什么！\"她吹嘘道，当惊讶的鸟人们看着她被烧焦的羽毛时。“这将在冬日的寒冷日子里保暖我们，并在漫长的夜晚中保持安全！”",
	"Ardea was at first concerned at the presence of fire in the world, for she knew the forests could burn, and that misuse of the fire would bring harm to Everden. But, when she saw the birdfolk gather around the fires, and felt the gentle warmth a small flame could provide to her children, she was overcome with happiness.": "阿尔迪娅（Ardea）起初对世界上存在火焰感到担忧，因为她知道森林可能会燃烧，而对火的滥用会给埃弗登（Everden）带来危害。但是，当她看到鸟人围绕着篝火聚集，并感受到一小团火焰能为她的孩子们提供的温暖时，她被幸福感淹没。",
	"\"This,\" she declared, \"is worthy of a boon.\"": "\"这个,\" 她宣布道, \"值得一个赐福.\"",
	"And thus was Gesme changed. Set ablaze with the flames of knowledge and creativity, she became an Amaranthine. The forms of her followers changed too, and they became the first corvums. They were gifted with a bit of her cleverness and foresight, but Ardea gave them all black talons, feathers, and beaks as a reminder of the price Gesme paid to bring fire into the world.": "于是，格斯梅(Gesme)发生了改变。被知识和创造力的火焰点燃后，她成为了一位不朽者(Amaranthine)。她的追随者们的形态也发生了改变，他们成为了第一批乌鸦人(corvums)。他们被赋予了一些她的聪明和远见，但阿尔迪亚(Ardea)给了他们全都黑色的爪子、羽毛和喙，作为格斯梅为将火带入世界所付出代价的提醒。",
	"The second to present a worthy gift was Reya, whose hunting skills were second to none. Though she was small, she was nimble, swift, and wise in the ways of the forest. Reya was capable and reliable, but birdfolk deemed her too independent to be a leader. She would travel the length and breadth of the land on her hunts, sometimes not returning for weeks at a time.": "第二个呈现一份值得的礼物的是蕾娅(Reya)，她的狩猎技能无人能及。尽管她个子小，但她敏捷、迅速，并且精通森林的知识。蕾娅能干可靠，但鸟人们认为她太独立，不适合担任领导。她会在狩猎时走遍大地的南北，有时候甚至连续几周不归。",
	"During one of her journeys Reya encountered a stranger. The traveler's true form was hidden under a cloak, but they could fly and clearly felt as comfortable in the trees as any birdfolk. They had heard of Reya's skill in racing, hunting, and navigating the forest, and proposed three challenges, to which Reya agreed.": "在Reya的旅途中，她遇到了一个陌生人。这位旅行者的真实形态被一件斗篷遮掩着，但他们能够飞行，并且在树木间的移动像任何飞禽一样自如。他们听说过Reya在赛跑、狩猎和穿越森林方面的技能，并提出了三项挑战，而Reya也同意了。",
	"For the first event, the pair moved to a patch of open sky overlooking rugged plains. There was a rocky outcropping in the distance; whoever flew there first would be the winner. The race began, and Reya immediately fell behind, the cloaked figure moving faster than Reya had ever seen.": "在第一个事件中，这对人马移到了一个俯瞰崎岖平原的一片开阔天空。远处有一块岩石突出物；谁先飞到那里谁就是赢家。比赛开始了，蕾娅立刻落后了，那个披着斗篷的人比蕾娅见过的任何人都要快。",
	"Reya summoned all her strength to keep up, beating her wings like never before. Yet the traveler kept inching forward, and she was unable to close the gap in time.": "瑞雅鼓足了所有力量，拼命地拍打着翅膀，前所未有地飞行。然而旅行者却一直在不断前行，她无法及时拉近彼此的距离。",
	"Reya steeled herself for the next challenge. They flew to the meadows, where small creatures grazed, and it was decided that the first to catch five hares would be the winner. Reya moved with purpose, confident no one could best her skills with a bow, a tool of her own creation. Each of her shots found its mark, until she had but a single hare left to catch. But when Reya looked over at the traveler, she was shocked to see them waiting impatiently with a full complement.": "瑞娅（Reya）为迎接下一个挑战做好了准备。他们飞到了草地，那里有小动物在吃草。决定第一个捕捉到五只野兔的人将成为赢家。瑞娅行动迅速，自信没有人能比得过她的弓箭技巧，这是她自己创造的工具。她的每一箭都命中了目标，直到只剩下一只野兔未捕捉。但当瑞娅看向旅行者时，她震惊地发现对方正在不耐烦地等待，手中已经有了满额的野兔。",
	"For the third and final event, the pair flew to the center of the forest. The first to emerge into the open fields beyond would be the victor. These were forests Reya knew well, and she was certain she would win. As soon as they had started though, Reya saw the traveler alight, darting through the trees as if weightless. Reya kept pace, using every trick she could to give herself an advantage. Still the traveler pulled ahead, if only by inches, and emerged victorious.": "对于第三个也是最后一个事件，这对比赛者飞向了森林中心。第一个冲出开阔地进入的将是胜利者。这些是蕾娅熟悉的森林，她确信自己会赢。然而，一开始，蕾娅就看到旅行者飞奔而出，如同无重之身般穿过树林。蕾娅保持步伐，尽一切可能运用各种诀窍给自己创造优势。然而旅行者仍然领先，哪怕只是一点点，最终胜出。",
	"Reya landed on a nearby branch and cursed her lack of skill. After a moment of pause however, she regained her composure, and thanked her competitor. Yet the traveler laughed, a sound so familiar, Reya wondered why she hadn't noticed before.": "蕾雅（Reya）降落在附近的树枝上，咒骂自己缺乏技巧。然而，停顿片刻后，她恢复了镇定，并感谢了她的竞争对手。然而，旅行者笑了，笑声如此熟悉，蕾雅（Reya）想知道为什么她之前没有注意到。",
	"\"You have nothing to be ashamed of, birdfolk. I see your skills are real. You are the first to so nearly best me in every event, and this is no easy feat.\" The traveler removed their cloak, and Reya could not believe her eyes. She had been challenged by the wind itself.": "“鸟人们，你们没有什么好羞愧的。我看到你们的技能是真实的。你们是第一个几乎在每个事件中几乎击败我的人，这绝非易事。” 旅行者脱下他们的斗篷，蕾娅简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。她竟然被风本身挑战了。",
	"It swirled, spinning a cloak out of the very clouds, which it placed around Reya. \"Consider this a gift, for providing me with such sport.\" Reya thanked the wind, and with that, it departed, caressing Reya's feathers in a familiar breeze.": "它旋转着，从云朵中甩出一件披风，然后把它披在蕾娅身上。“把这当作一份礼物，感谢你给了我如此的娱乐。”蕾娅感谢风，然后它离开了，用一股熟悉的微风抚摸着蕾娅的羽毛。",
	"When the time came to present a gift, Reya offered Ardea her cloak of clouds, along with the story of her adventure. As Reya told her tale, Ardea could see the eyes of the other birdfolk light up with excitement. When Reya had finished, Ardea returned Reya's cloak to her, saying the story of her adventure was the rarer gift. Reya was changed, and became the Amaranthine of wind, archery, and exploration. Those she inspired became the first raptors. They began to take on a nomadic lifestyle, finding their fortune day by day as Reya once did and told tales of their own adventures by the light of the campfire.": "当到了赠送礼物的时候，瑞娅向阿尔迪亚奉上了她的云斗篷，并附上了她的冒险故事。当瑞娅讲述她的故事时，阿尔迪亚看到其他鸟人们的眼睛兴奋地发光。当瑞娅讲完后，阿尔迪亚将斗篷还给了瑞娅，说她的冒险故事才是更珍贵的礼物。瑞娅发生了改变，成为了风之不凋者，弓箭和探险的象征。她所激励的人成为了第一批猛禽。他们开始过着游牧的生活方式，像瑞娅一样日复一日地寻找他们的财富，并在篝火的光芒下讲述他们自己的冒险故事。",
	"The third to present a precious gift was Hanera, a gentle birdfolk and the first to shift her focus away from the sky. Rather than live in the trees with other birdfolk, Hanera made a home for herself below the canopy. She cared for the soil and the earth, and in return the earth gifted her with wisdom. From the earth, Hanera learned to speak with plants—knowledge she used to better care for them. She soon earned fame among the birdfolk, as one who grew the largest and best-tasting crops.": "第三位呈献珍贵礼物的是汉妮拉（Hanera）, 一只温和的鸟人，也是第一位将注意力从天空转向其他地方的鸟人。汉妮拉并没有和其他鸟人一起住在树上，而是在树冠下建了一个家。她关心土壤和大地，作为回报，大地赐予她智慧。从大地那里，汉妮拉学会了与植物交流——这些知识让她更好地照料植物。她很快在鸟人中间声名鹊起，成为种植最大最美味庄稼的人。",
	"\"These crops,\" Hanera thought, \"are the finest gift I could offer to our Mother.\" And so she set about planting a large garden, its bounty reserved for Ardea.": "“这些庄稼，”汉妮拉想，“是我能献给我们母亲的最好礼物。” 于是她开始种植一个大花园，其中的丰收留给了(Ardea)。",
	"One day, while tending to her garden, Hanera saw a family of haggard travelers making their way out of the woods. When they saw Hanera, the mother begged her for aid.": "一天，当Hanera在她的花园里忙着时，她看到一家疲惫的旅行者从树林中走出来。当他们看到Hanera时，母亲请求她的帮助。",
	"\"Please, kind sister, we are in great need. We were traveling through the forest when a creature attacked me and wounded my wing. We escaped, but I cannot fly. Please, help us, we are terribly hungry.\"": "\"请，善良的姐姐，我们急需帮助。我们在穿过森林时遭到一只生物的袭击，我的翅膀受伤了。我们逃脱了，但我无法飞行。请帮助我们，我们非常饥饿。\"",
	"Hanera knew that she couldn't feed herself and this family while storing crops for Ardea. Even still, she could not turn them away in their desperate state. She offered to share her home and her food for as long as the travelers needed, making sure their needs were met before saving any food for Ardea.": "汉妮拉知道她无法在为阿尔迪亚存储作物的同时养活自己和这个家庭。即便如此，她无法拒绝这些处于绝望状态的旅行者。她提出与他们分享她的家和食物，直到他们需要为止，确保他们的需求得到满足，然后才考虑为阿尔迪亚保存食物。",
	"The travelers stayed with Hanera for many nights while the mother healed. Each day, Hanera would prepare the family meals, telling the plants of their plight. The plants understood, and were honored to nourish the weary and wounded birdfolk. In return, Hanera ensured their seeds were saved and planted again, so their lives would continue indefinitely.": "旅行者们在母亲康复期间与汉妮拉(Hanera)住了很多晚。每天，汉妮拉会为这个家庭准备饭菜，并向植物们述说他们的困境。植物们理解了，并很荣幸地滋养这些疲惫和受伤的鸟人。作为回报，汉妮拉确保保存并再次种植它们的种子，让它们的生命无限延续。",
	"At night, Hanera applied medicine to the mother's wound made from the leaves of kindly herbs. By the end of the season the mother had healed, the family was in good health, and they gratefully flew away.": "夜晚，汉妮拉用善良草药的叶子为母亲的伤口涂药。到了季节末，母亲伤口愈合了，全家人身体健康，他们感激地飞走了。",
	"When the day finally came for birdfolk to present their gifts, all Hanera could offer Ardea was a few fruits and vegetables. She wove them together along with flowers she had grown, attempting to make her offering look more cheerful.": "当鸟人们最终要展示他们的礼物时，汉妮拉只能给阿尔迪亚一些水果和蔬菜。她把它们编织在一起，还加上了自己种的花，试图让她的礼物看起来更加欢快。",
	"\"I'm sorry, Mother Stork,\" Hanera said. \"I had meant to present you with a great harvest, but this is all I could provide.\"": "“对不起，(Mother Stork) 母鹳，”汉妮拉说道。“我本打算给您带来丰收，但这是我所能提供的一切。”",
	"Ardea took the wreath, and spoke gladly: \"You have given me more than enough, for you see my child, I received your compassion for an entire season.\" As Ardea spoke, celestial messengers appeared by her side, and together they transformed into the birdfolk family Hanera had so tenderly cared for.": "阿尔迪亚接过花环，喜悦地说道：\"你给了我远超我所需的，因为你看到了我的孩子，我收到了你一个整个季节的怜悯。\" 当阿尔迪亚说话时，天国使者出现在她身边，他们一起变成了鸟人家族，汉纳拉（Hanera）曾如此温柔地照顾过他们。",
	"For her charity, Hanera received the Amaranthine's boon: her feathers turned green and grew into vines and shoots, adorned with the most beautiful flowers. Other birdfolk stared in awe, and those who followed Hanera became the first gallus, blessed with her inspiring kindness, as well as her closeness with the earth and all growing things.": "为了她的慈善事业，汉妮拉（Hanera）获得了不凋花（Amaranthine）的恩惠：她的羽毛变成了绿色，生长成藤蔓和嫩芽，点缀着最美丽的花朵。其他鸟人们惊叹不已，那些跟随汉妮拉的人成为了第一批加鲁斯（gallus），得到了她鼓舞人心的善良，以及她与大地和所有生长物的亲近。",
	"The fourth to present a commendable gift was Altus, whose hunting skills were second only to Reya's, though Altus journeyed the Wood to test his limits rather than explore as Reya did. Altus felt pure joy when overcoming obstacles. He loved the cold seasons and challenged himself by hunting at night. His nocturnal existence granted Altus a perspective other birdfolk lacked.": "第四位呈现出一份值得称赞的礼物的是奥尔图斯(Altus)，他的狩猎技能仅次于蕾娅(Reya)，尽管奥尔图斯是为了测试自己的极限而穿越树林，而不像蕾娅那样探索。奥尔图斯克服障碍时感到纯粹的喜悦。他热爱寒冷的季节，并挑战自己在夜晚狩猎。他的夜间存在赋予奥尔图斯一种其他鸟人缺乏的视角。",
	"\"What if I gifted Ardea something she has never seen before?\" he thought. \"Yes! I shall hunt the moon, and present it to her, so that she may see its lovely glow.\" This would be unthinkable to any other birdfolk, but Altus was resolute, confident his gift would please Ardea.": "“如果我送(`Ardea`)一个她从未见过的东西会怎样呢？”他想。“是的！我将猎取月亮，并把它呈现给她，这样她就可以看到它美丽的光辉。” 对于其他任何鸟人来说，这是不可想象的，但(`Altus`)坚定地认为他的礼物会让(`Ardea`)高兴。",
	"However, he was neither as skilled or nimble as Reya, nor as clever or cunning as Gesme. His arrows would not scratch the moon, and despite his great strength, he could not move it. But Altus was stubborn, for many nights he tried and failed to bring down his quarry. The more he tried, the more frustrated he became. Altus even thought he could hear the moon's laughter reflected in the babbling brooks and rippling ponds, mocking his futile efforts. Still, Altus remained determined.": "然而，他既不像瑞雅那样熟练敏捷，也不像盖斯梅那样聪明狡猾。他的箭无法划破月亮，尽管他力大无穷，也无法将其移动。但阿尔图斯很固执，他连续多个晚上试图击倒猎物，却屡战屡败。他越是努力，就越是沮丧。阿尔图斯甚至觉得自己能听到月亮的笑声在潺潺溪流和涟漪池塘中回荡，嘲笑他的徒劳努力。然而，阿尔图斯仍然坚定不移。",
	"Tyton, intrigued, observed Altus as he struggled. \"Why do you persist in this task, my child?\" the Amaranthine of night asked. \"You must know you will not succeed.\"": "泰顿（Tyton）好奇地观察着奥尔图斯（Altus）挣扎着说道：“为什么你要坚持这个任务，我的孩子？”夜色中的不朽者问道：“你必须知道你不会成功的。”",
	"Altus replied, \"If I did not try, then I would never know for certain if I could. But you may be right. For all my strength, I can never best the moon, and only a fool refuses to acknowledge when he has been bested.\" Altus paused, letting out a sigh. \"Pity, it would have made a lovely gift for Ardea.\"": "阿尔图斯回答道：“如果我不尝试，那么我永远不会确定自己是否能成功。但你可能是对的。尽管我很强大，但我永远无法胜过月亮，只有愚人才会拒绝承认自己已经被打败。” 阿尔图斯停顿了一下，叹了口气。“遗憾，这本来会是送给阿尔迪亚的一份美好礼物。”",
	"Tyton was touched, not just by the sentiment but by the incredible will of this birdfolk.": "泰顿被这位鸟人的坚强意志所感动，不仅仅是因为情感。(Tyton)。",
	"\"Your resolve does you credit\" Tyton said. \"To capture the moon, you will require this.\" He said producing a lidded chalice, intricately carved from the wood of an alder tree. Tyton gave it to Altus, then the Amaranthine of night disappeared.": "\"你的决心值得称赞,\" 泰顿说道。\"要捕捉月亮，你会需要这个。\" 他说着拿出一个有盖的圣杯，由一棵赤杨树的木头精心雕刻而成。泰顿把它交给了奥尔塔斯，然后那位夜之不凋者消失了。",
	"Altus was puzzled, until the moon appeared from behind a cloud. He heard its laughter in the pond behind him. When he turned, he saw it: the moon's reflection set perfectly in the still, clear waters. Without delay, Altus filled the chalice with water. With the moon clearly reflected within the chalice, he quickly shut the lid. The moon was caught.": "阿尔图斯（Altus）感到困惑，直到月亮从云后面出现。他听到月亮在他身后的池塘里笑声。当他转过身去，他看到了：月亮的倒影完美地映在宁静、清澈的水中。阿尔图斯毫不犹豫地用水装满圣杯。月亮在圣杯中清晰地映出，他迅速地合上盖子。月亮被困住了。",
	"As dawn began to break over the horizon, Tyton appeared once again before Altus, \"Let my sister gaze upon my creation, but return it by day's end. The night has need of it,\" old Father Owl said, before departing for the lands beyond life.": "当黎明开始破晓时，泰顿再次出现在奥尔图斯面前，“让我的妹妹瞧一瞧我的创造物，但必须在天黑前归还。夜晚需要它，”老猫头鹰之父说完后，便启程前往生命之外的土地。",
	"And so it was that Altus presented Ardea with the moon. He became the first strig, and his people were gifted with his great strength and indomitable will. He kept his oath to Tyton, returning the moon that very evening. For this, Tyton gifted all strigs with the ability to see clearly under its light. Tyton welcomed Altus as a guest in his home, deep within the lands of death. Altus found the cold there bracing, and decided to share it with the people of Everden. This is why the weather is so inclement in winter; Altus returns each year, carrying storms of sleet and snow in his chalice, to test the birdfolk's endurance.": "就这样，阿尔图斯（Altus）将月亮赠予阿尔迪亚（Ardea）。他成为了第一位猫头鹰人，并且他的人民也因他的强大力量和不屈意志而受到赐予。他信守对泰顿（Tyton）的誓言，在当晚归还了月亮。为此，泰顿赐予所有猫头鹰人在月光下清晰看见的能力。泰顿欢迎阿尔图斯作为客人来到他位于死亡之地深处的家中。阿尔图斯发现那里的寒冷令人振奋，并决定与埃弗登（Everden）的人们分享这种感觉。这就是为什么冬天的天气如此恶劣；阿尔图斯每年都会回来，用他的圣杯带来冰雹和雪暴，来考验鸟人们的耐力。",
	"The last to present a worthy gift was Clhuran, who seemed an odd choice for a leader. Clhuran had no desire to lead.": "最后一个呈现出有价值礼物的是克鲁兰(Clhuran)，他似乎是一个奇怪的领导选择。克鲁兰并不渴望领导。",
	"He was whimsical and impulsive. He had wild moods, and was never able to focus on one task for too long. He also had incredible luck. Most saw him as little more than a bumbler, someone who floated their way through life. In truth, Clhuran was full of mirth and cunning. \"Where I am,\" he oft remarked, \"is simply where I am meant to be. I follow the flow of the universe.\"": "他是任性和冲动的。他情绪多变，从来不能集中精力做一件事太久。他还有惊人的运气。大多数人认为他不过是一个胡闹者，一个随波逐流的人。事实上，Clhuran充满了欢乐和狡诈。他经常说：“我在哪里，就是我应该在的地方。我顺应宇宙的流动。”",
	"For all his mirth, Clhuran was notoriously fickle; he was a trickster, who delighted in humbling birdfolk who boasted about their cleverness. This earned him many admirers, and just as many enemies.": "尽管Clhuran总是欢乐的，但他臭名昭著地善变；他是一个爱捉弄那些自吹自擂聪明的鸟人的恶作剧者。这让他赢得了许多崇拜者，也招来了同样多的敌人。",
	"Clhuran never intended to compete in the gift-giving contest.": "Clhuran从未打算参加送礼比赛。",
	"\"What should I care what others think of me,\" he harrumphed, \"So long as I am happy?\" Some birdfolk, bitter at having been fooled by him, claimed Clhuran could never hope to win such a contest. Clhuran tried to pay them no heed, in his heart he felt the barbs hit their mark.": "“我为什么要在乎别人对我的看法呢，”他哼了一声，“只要我自己开心就好了。” 一些鸟人，因为被他愚弄而心怀怨恨，声称克鲁兰永远不可能赢得这样的比赛。克鲁兰试图不去理会他们，但心里却感到那些刺痛中的真实。",
	"\"Who am I kidding,\" Clhuran sighed. \"I am not strong, nor smart, nor skilled, nor leaderly... I couldn't possibly produce a gift worthy of Ardea.\" With this last thought he sank into a bitter melancholy.": "“我在自欺欺人，”Clhuran叹了口气。“我既不强壮，也不聪明，也不熟练，也不具领导力……我不可能制作出值得Ardea欣赏的礼物。”想到这里，他陷入了一种痛苦的忧郁情绪中。",
	"It was only when a young boy approached him that he regained his confidence. \"Please Clhuran, won't you show us what you can do?\" the small birdfolk said. \"Many of us love your tricks, and your jokes. You bring joy to all birdfolk! Surely if you try you can do it!\"": "只有当一个年轻男孩走近他时，他才重拾信心。“请克鲁兰(Clhuran)，你能不能给我们展示一下你的本颺？”小鸟人说。“我们很多人都喜欢你的把戏和笑话。你给所有鸟人带来了快乐！如果你尝试一下，肯定能行！”",
	"Clhuran saw the sincerity in the boy's eyes, and suddenly he knew what to do. \"Fine, fine,\" he exclaimed in mock annoyance. \"I suppose I shall entertain you.\"": "Clhuran看到了男孩眼中的真诚，突然间他知道该怎么做了。“好吧，好吧，”他假装生气地喊道。“我想我应该来取悦你。”",
	"With newfound confidence, he approached Ardea. All of the birdfolk were gathered, and when Clhuran looked upon the crowd he saw both enemies and friends. Thoughts of those friendships allowed Clhuran to reach deep within himself, and from the depths of his soul he felt a beat, like the Great Rhythm itself. Channeling this energy, Clhuran opened his beak and brought forth a most beautiful gift: a song.": "怀着新的信心，他走向阿尔迪亚(`Ardea`)。所有的鸟人都聚集在一起，当克卢兰(`Clhuran`)看着人群时，他看到了敌人和朋友。对那些友谊的思念让克卢兰深入自己的内心，在灵魂的深处，他感受到了一种跳动，就像伟大的节奏本身。克卢兰引导着这股能量，张开嘴喋出了一份最美丽的礼物：一首歌。",
	"It was a song so perfect, so harmonious, that no birdfolk could deny its charm. Ardea beamed. \"My child, you have within you a rare gift. May all of your kin be blessed by it.\" With those words, Clhuran became the first luma, the Amaranthine of all fortune, good or ill. His peculiar connection to fate is shared by all his kin.": "这是一首如此完美、和谐的歌曲，以至于没有任何鸟人能够抗拒它的魅力。Ardea笑容满面。“我的孩子，你心中拥有一种罕见的天赋。愿你的族人都因此受到祝福。”随着这些话语，Clhuran成为了第一个luma，所有幸运或不幸的不朽者。他与命运的特殊联系被他所有的族人所分享。",
	"Ever since Clhuran's performance all birds sing, hoping that they might imitate the perfect song he sang to Ardea. While some sing pleasantly, Clhuran made it so those who mocked him can only trill, shriek, or caw artlessly. This is why it is always important to show respect for others, no matter how odd they may seem.": "自从克鲁兰(Clhuran)的表演之后，所有的鸟儿都在歌唱，希望能模仿他为阿尔迪亚(Ardea)唱的完美歌曲。虽然有些歌声悦耳动听，但克鲁兰让那些嘲笑他的人只能发出单调的啁啾、尖叫或咯咯叫声。这就是为什么无论别人看起来多么奇怪，都要尊重他们的重要性。",
	"\"O, seeing stars, hear my words and part the veil of night, Gift me thoughts of strategy, bless me with your sight. If this trial I do survive, with plans and actions shrewd, I pledge undying loyalty, for wisdom you imbued.\"": "\"哦，瞧见星星，听取我的话语，拨开夜幕的面纱，赐予我策略的思绪，用你的视力祝福我。如果我成功度过这一考验，用精明的计划和行动，我誓言永远忠诚，因为你赋予了智慧。\"",
	"Humblewood is a great and ancient land covered by a vast temperate forest. In some places, this forest is so old the trees dwarf even the tallest castles. In other places, smaller trees provide food and shelter for the fauna and folk of the Wood. Humblewood is named after the forest, but beyond the trees exist the towering range of The Crest mountains, the low-lying swamplands of the Mokk Fields, and the rocky shores of the Talongrip Coast.": "谦木（Humblewood）是一片古老而辽阔的温带森林覆盖的土地。在一些地方，这片森林非常古老，树木甚至比最高的城堡还要高大。在其他地方，较小的树木为动植物和居民提供食物和庇护。谦木之名源自这片森林，但在树木之外，还有高耸的冠山脉（The Crest mountains）、低洼的莫克原野（the Mokk Fields）和多岩的塔龙握海岸（the Talongrip Coast）。",
	"Many Humblewood locations can be encountered by playing through the Adventure in the Wood portion of this book. This section also fleshes out other locations, providing GMs and players alike with the tools to understand the places of the Wood and the people who live there.": "通过阅读本书中的“森林冒险”部分，玩家可以探索许多《谦木》中的地点。这一部分还详细介绍了其他地点，为GM和玩家提供了理解森林地区和居住在那里的人们的工具。",
	"Long ago, druids of the Wood learned how to speak with trees and use magic to shape them into shelters in which they could make their homes. This process was considered deeply respectful, as a tree could not be forced to take any shape it didn't agree to. So it was that specialist druids, known as shapers, became mediators between the will of the people and the will of the forest. Birdfolk shapers spoke to the tallest and most ancient tree in the Wood—Alderheart. The shapers obtained permission for birdfolk to build a home within Alderheart's branches. Later, the great tree again gave permission to shape its trunk into homes for an increasing population. This burgeoning city took the name of the tree who so generously provided a home for the people of the Wood, and Alderheart became Humblewood's capital. Known throughout the region as the \"Great Tree City,\" Alderheart, is a vibrant place and a cultural center, home to thousands of residents, some regional and some from the farthest corners of Everden.": "很久以前，(Wood)（森林）的德鲁伊学会了如何与树木交谈，并使用魔法将它们塑造成可以让他们居住的庇护所。这个过程被认为是非常尊重的，因为一棵树不能被迫接受任何它不同意的形状。因此，专门的德鲁伊，被称为塑形者，成为了人民意愿和森林意愿之间的调解者。鸟人塑形者与(Wood)（森林）中最高大、最古老的树木——艾尔德之心进行交谈。这些塑形者得到了鸟人在艾尔德之心的树枝上建造家园的许可。后来，这棵伟大的树再次同意将其树干塑造成越来越多人口的家园。这个蓬勃发展的城市以慷慨提供家园给(Wood)（森林）人民的树木之名命名，艾尔德之心成为了(Humblewood)（谦卑森林）的首府。艾尔德之心被称为“大树之城”，是一个充满活力的地方和文化中心，拥有数千名居民，一些是当地的，一些来自(Everden)（艾弗登）最遥远的角落。",
	"Alderheart is home to every race of birdfolk and humblefolk. The thriving community attracts people from faraway lands, like traveling merchants, explorers, and foreign dignitaries. Citizens of the Humblewood who don't live in the city routinely journey there to trade goods, stock up on supplies, engage in artistic endeavors, or simply to catch up on the latest news and gossip. Effectively everyone in Humblewood is connected to Alderheart.": "灰心镇（Alderheart）是各种鸟人和谦卑族群的家园。这个繁荣的社区吸引着来自遥远地方的人，比如旅行商人、探险家和外国贵族。在谦卑森林（Humblewood）中没有居住在城市里的居民经常前往那里交易商品、补充物资、从事艺术活动，或者简单地了解最新的消息和八卦。实际上，谦卑森林中的每个人都与灰心镇有联系。",
	"Virtually anything can be found in Alderheart, if you know where to look. The majority of the city's inhabitants are well-meaning, decent folk, but like any city there are dark alleys and back rooms. Crime here is usually kept in check by the Perch Guard, but while the city guards are vaunted as being among the best in the Wood, illicit activities continue under the cover of darkness.": "在奥尔德哈特，几乎任何东西都能找到，只要你知道在哪里寻找。这座城市的大部分居民都是好心的、正派的人，但和任何城市一样，也有黑暗的小巷和后房。这里的犯罪通常由(Perch Guard)控制，但尽管城市警卫被誉为是木之中最好的警卫之一，非法活动仍在黑暗中继续进行。",
	"As Alderheart is massive, it is often difficult for visitors to tell they are in a tree at all. The Great Tree City is divided into three main levels where people live, work, and go about their lives: the canopy, the trunk, and the roots.": "由于阿尔德哈特(Alderheart)巨大，访客往往很难分辨他们是否真的在一棵树上。这座巨树城市分为三个主要层次，人们在这里生活、工作和度过他们的生活：树冠层、树干层和树根层。",
	"The canopy contains Alderheart's most iconic structures, including the chambers of the Birdfolk Council, the headquarters of the Perch Guard, and the largest market in the Wood. This market boasts boutiques where patrons can find high-quality weapons, armor, and adventuring gear, the latest fashions, finest foods, and goods brought in from all across Everden. Outside the main market, smaller shops peddle wares off the beaten path. Some contain enchanted goods at a bargain, though any Alderheart socialite will recommend sticking to the more respectable shops.": "树冠区包含了艾尔德哈特(Alderheart)最具标志性的建筑，包括鸟人议会的议事厅、栖木卫队的总部，以及木之大市场。这个市场拥有精品店，顾客可以找到高质量的武器、盔甲和冒险装备，最新的时尚品、最美味的食物，以及从整个埃弗登(Everden)带来的商品。在主要市场之外，还有一些小店沿着不太常走的路兜售商品。有些店里出售的附魔商品价格便宜，尽管任何艾尔德哈特社交名流都会建议坚持去更受尊敬的商店购物。",
	"City gates, located at strategic points around the canopy, are the only sanctioned ways to enter the city, and are moni-tored by Perch Guard watchposts. These gates are connected to lower levels of the tree and the forest floor by large winding stairways that allow travel by foot. Vast infrastructures for transportation are common in the canopy. \"Branchroads\", specially-shaped wooden pathways, are the arteries of trade in Alderheart. Along with rope bridges, these roads allow couriers to move goods from place to place using hand carts. Pulleys connected to raisable platforms are used to lift freight from the forest floor. In the outermost branches, where such infrastructure cannot be supported, gliding platforms provide birdfolk, at least, with a means of crossing otherwise impassable gaps. Without the ability to glide, navigating this part of the capital becomes increasingly dangerous.": "城门位于树冠周围的战略点，是进入城市的唯一被批准的方式，并由(Perch Guard)守望塔监控。这些城门通过大型蜿蜒的楼梯连接到树木的下层和森林地面，以便步行旅行。在树冠中，交通基础设施非常普遍。\"枝道\"，特殊形状的木质路径，是奥尔德哈特贸易的动脉。除了绳桥，这些道路还允许信使使用手推车将货物从一个地方运送到另一个地方。连接到可升降平台的滑轮被用来从森林地面吊起货物。在最外围的树枝上，无法支撑这样的基础设施，滑翔平台为鸟人提供了跨越否则无法通过的间隙的手段。没有滑翔能力，穿越首都的这一部分变得越来越危险。",
	"Buildings in the canopy are made from a variety of materials, including stone, wood, and brick. Most are stationed atop reinforced platforms to keep them stable. The more impres-sive homes are located in the Boughs District, just above the market. Those on the outer branches tend to be made of wood and have a more modest feel to them.": "树冠中的建筑物由各种材料制成，包括石头、木头和砖头。大多数建筑物都建在加固的平台上，以保持稳定。更令人印象深刻的住宅位于（Boughs District）（树枝区），就在市场上方。外围分支上的建筑物通常由木头制成，感觉更加朴素。",
	"The largest section of the metropolis, the trunk, which acts as an intermediary zone between the prosperous canopy and the less affluent roots. Many humblefolk make their homes here, where there is stable floor beneath them.": "都市中最大的部分，树干，充当着繁荣的树冠和不那么富裕的根系之间的中间地带。许多平民在这里安家，他们脚下有稳固的地板。",
	"The trunk can be one of the most confusing and disorienting areas of Alderheart for new travelers. Pathways split and diverge, sometimes tapering off into nothing. Systems of specially-designed cold lanterns serve as signposts along the main paths. These lanterns use either captured fireflies or motes of magic to provide light, depending on the neighborhood. In either case, lamplighters are tasked with making sure they stay lit during the day to provide a day/night cycle.": "树干区可能是对新旅行者来说最令人困惑和迷失方向的地方之一。路径会分叉和分歧，有时会渐渐消失。沿着主要路径设置了一套专门设计的冷灯笼系统作为路标。这些灯笼使用捕获的萤火虫或魔法微粒来提供光线，取决于所在的街区。无论哪种情况，点灯人负责确保它们在白天保持点亮，以提供昼夜循环。",
	"In the trunk, another market thrives. Here, stalls of all kinds cluster around central support pillars shaped from Alderheart's wood. They showcase unique wares and niche humblefolk-style foods and cultural goods not found in canopy markets. There are also curiosity shops and sellers of regional wares, such as crystals harvested from the backs of young basilisks. Additionally, the trunk market is home to inns, taverns, and public houses. This is the best place in Alderheart to find serviceable goods and adventuring gear for those looking to save coin. Near the market is a druidic grove of moss and fungi supported by the Tenders, who help care for the tree and train new recruits to their order.": "在树干内部，另一个市场繁荣兴旺。这里，各种摊位围绕着由艾尔德之心木雕成的中央支柱聚集。它们展示着独特的商品和小众民间食品以及在林冠市场中找不到的文化商品。还有一些古玩店和地区商品的销售商，比如从年轻巴西利斯克背上采集的水晶。此外，树干市场还有客栈、酒馆和公共房屋。这是在艾尔德之心找到实用商品和冒险装备的最佳地点，适合那些想要省钱的人。市场附近有一个由护卫者支持的苔藓和真菌的德鲁伊林地，他们帮助照料这棵树并培训新的入门者加入他们的组织。",
	"Beyond the many shops and goods on offer in the trunk market, the central support pillars contain tenement style housing for the most cosmopolitan trunk dwellers. More affluent homes can also be found here, shaped out of the trunk, for Alderheart's traditionally minded humblefolk nobility, as well as birdfolk aristocrats whose homes have been here since Alderheart was first shaped.": "在树干市场提供的许多商店和商品之外，中央支柱包含了供最具世界性的树干居民居住的公寓式住房。在这里还可以找到更富裕的住宅，是由树干塑造而成的，供Alderheart传统谦逊的贵族居住，以及鸟人贵族，他们的住所自从Alderheart第一次塑造以来就在这里。",
	"Down past the trunk market, pathways widen and wind, illuminated by knotholes in the tree that allow sunlight to filter inside. Although some homes in these bright hollows are built near the bark, where windows can be shaped out of the wood, most homes are shaped inside the dim pathways. A select few obtain permission to shape homes on the outside surface of the trunk. These special homes are connected to interior pathways via carefully fenced roads, and are considered a luxury that many cannot afford.": "穿过树干市场，小径变宽，蜿蜒曲折，透过树洞照亮，让阳光过滤进来。尽管一些房屋建在明亮的洞穴附近，可以在木头上开窗，但大多数房屋建在昏暗的小径内部。少数人获准在树干外表面建造房屋。这些特殊的房屋通过精心围栏的道路与内部小径相连，被视为许多人无法承担的奢侈品。",
	"The farther down the trunk one travels, the more shabby and ill-kept the residences and infrastructure become. There are no officially authorized ways to leave or enter the tree by way of lower parts of the trunk, and Perch Guard are constantly on the lookout for smugglers.": "随着沿树干向下行进，住宅和基础设施变得越来越破旧和不整洁。没有官方授权的方式可以通过树干底部离开或进入，而栖木卫士(Perc Guard)则不断监视走私者。",
	"Beneath the lowest parts of the trunk, a series of tunnels have been carved into the roots of Alderheart. At first, the roots were not considered to be official parts of the city, and their development was largely overlooked by city officials in the canopy, until word arrived of the illicit activities taking place there. Many were convinced that the tunneling would simply go away if druids were to heal the tree, but Alderheart itself took pity on those living here, and decided to allow the tunnels to exist rather than force people from their homes. The root tunnels have since been strengthened by druidic shaping, lit to be on par with the inside of the trunk, and a garrison of the Perch Guard was stationed nearby. Even with these improvements, the roots remain the poorest area in Alderheart: the slums of the Great Tree City. Here, the air is always dank and humid, and wild fungi grow rampant. The buildings are mostly cobbled together from scavenged materials, and some have been converted into community gathering places. These hubs help connect communities in the roots with helpful aid from the trunk district, and allow the people here to organize and plan neighborhood events. Life in the roots isn't easy, but people are trying their best to keep their communities strong, as they petition the canopy for better living conditions. There are few shops here, and they typically traffic in smuggled and stolen goods. Crime is ever-present; many who dwell in the roots see it as necessary to survive.": "在树干最低部以下，一系列隧道已经被雕刻进了(`Alderheart`)的根部。起初，这些根部并未被视为城市的正式组成部分，它们的发展在树冠中的城市官员们大多忽视了，直到有传言称那里发生了非法活动。许多人认为，如果德鲁伊们治愈了这棵树，隧道就会消失，但(`Alderheart`)本身对居住在这里的人们怜悯起来，决定允许这些隧道存在，而不是强迫人们离开他们的家园。根部隧道后来被德鲁伊们加固，照明设施与树干内部相媲美，并在附近驻扎了一支(`Perch Guard`)的警卫队。尽管有这些改进，根部仍然是(`Alderheart`)中最贫穷的地区：大树之城的贫民窟。在这里，空气总是潮湿阴暗，野生真菌繁茂。建筑物大多是用拾来的材料拼凑而成，有些已经被改造成社区聚集地。这些中心有助于将根部社区与树干区的援助联系起来，让这里的人们能够组织和策划社区活动。根部的生活并不容易，但人们正在尽力保持他们的社区强大，同时向树冠请求改善生活条件。这里几乎没有商店，它们通常贩卖走私和偷盗的货物。犯罪永远存在；许多栖身在根部的人认为这是为了生存所必需的。",
	"This small town exists on the fringes of the Scorched Grove, where wind-blown ash causes the soil to be fertile and the land rich with game. It is dangerous living so close to the Grove, but the rewards make it worth the risk for the intrepid folk that call Ashbarrow home. The town takes its name from the small hill upon which it rests, and is inhabited by a mix of birdfolk and humblefolk who shelter within its low stone walls. A large watchtower near the town's center serves as both a means of observing when the winds will bring ash from the Scorched Grove, as well as an observatory for seers who watch the stars for signs and portents.": "这座小镇位于焦痕林的边缘，风吹灰烬使土壤肥沃，土地富饶，危险。但对于那些称Ashbarrow（灰丘）为家的勇敢人来说，风险是值得的。这座小镇以其坐落的小山而得名，居住着一群鸟人和谦卑之人，他们躲在低矮的石墙内。镇中心附近有一座高大的瞭望塔，既可用来观察风向何时会从焦痕林带来灰烬，也可作为占卜者观测星象的台。",
	"The Avium is a college of magical arts with a wide range of subjects available for study. The free transmission of knowledge is one of the Avium's core principles, but the College nonetheless maintains a certain degree of secrecy regarding some of the more dangerous magical tomes it safeguards. All races are welcome within the Avium's halls, although admittance is granted only by the will of the headmaster and a council of senior staff. Prospective students are tested for their skills, but also the motivation for their studies. The College takes great care to ensure its members will positively represent the legacy and reputation of the Avium out in the world.": "阿维姆（Avium）是一所魔法艺术学院，提供广泛的学科供学习。知识的自由传播是阿维姆的核心原则之一，但学院仍然对一些更危险的魔法典籍保持一定程度的保密。所有种族都受到阿维姆大厅的欢迎，尽管入学仅由校长和一群高级教职员会的意愿决定。潜在学生将接受技能测试，同时也会考察他们学习动机。学院非常重视确保其成员能够积极地代表阿维姆在世界上展现出的传统和声誉。",
	"The Avium was once a living tree that was home to a perch known for producing some of Humblewood's most legendary scholars. After the tree's death, a group of wizards from this perch decided to found the Avium here. They used transmutation magic to artificially petrify the tree, and then shaped it into a building capable of housing the largest mage college in Humblewood. Controlled by magical fields, the College's many structures float in circuit with one another: a collection of towers, courtyards, and observatories all hover around the huge central building, each equipped with a bridge that lines up with the main building at regular intervals. Those not gifted with the birdfolk's limited form of flight must harness their magic for transportation, or wait until the archways align to allow for foot traffic.": "Avium（阿维安）曾经是一棵活着的树，是一位知名的栖息地，孕育了一些Humblewood（谦卑森林）最传奇的学者。在这棵树死后，来自这个栖息地的一群巫师决定在此建立Avium（阿维安）。他们使用变形魔法人工使树木石化，然后将其塑造成一个能够容纳Humblewood（谦卑森林）最大法师学院的建筑物。由魔法领域控制，学院的许多建筑物在彼此之间循环漂浮：一系列塔楼、庭院和天文台都围绕着巨大的中央建筑物悬浮，每个建筑都配备了桥梁，定期与主建筑物对齐。那些没有鸟人有限飞行能力的人必须利用他们的魔法进行交通，或者等待拱门对齐以便步行通行。",
	"While the curriculum is diverse, the College does impose certain limitations, most notably regarding necromancy. As inhabitants of the Wood, the Avium's primary staff members originate from a culture with great respect for nature and the cycle of life. As such, the necromantic arts are taught mainly in a theoretical sense. Practical application of necromancy at the College is highly regulated, and available only under strict guidance.": "尽管课程内容多样化，学院确实会施加一些限制，其中最明显的是关于死灵术(necromancy)。作为森林的居民，阿维姆(Avium)的主要教职员工来自一个对自然和生命循环非常尊重的文化。因此，死灵术主要以理论方式教授。在学院内，死灵术的实际应用受到严格监管，只在严格指导下才能使用。",
	"Students are, however, encouraged to explore other schools of magic to their fullest potential. Breakthroughs in elemental theorems, teleportation methods, and advances in practical transmutation have been pioneered at the Avium. Within these classrooms you will find future Tenders, council members, and protectors of the Wood. The application process is demanding, and the curriculum rigorous. Few make it to graduation. For those who prove their grasp of the arcane, endorsement from the Avium is among the highest of honors.": "然而，鼓励学生充分发掘魔法的其他流派。在阿维姆（Avium）开创了元素定理、传送方法和实用变形术方面的突破。在这些教室里，你会找到未来的（Tenders）、理事会成员和（Wood）的守护者。申请流程要求严格，课程内容严谨。很少有人能毕业。对于那些证明了他们对奥术的掌握的人来说，阿维姆的认可是最高荣誉之一。",
	"Farming in birdfolk perches is unconventional. In the taller perches, fruiting vines and mosses are grown from the branches of the trees. The largest and most productive farming perch is Brackenmill. Considered a lesser perch due to its proximity to the ground, Brackenmill nevertheless consists of many proximate tree-farms that, after years of growth, melded into one another. It includes a central hub of shops, trade halls, and shipping platforms, all under the watchful eye of the local Perch Guard. Some of the farms have even begun to expand downward, encompassing small horticultural plots at the base of trees. The grounded farms produce luxury goods that can't be grown along the branches, and house corrals for giant insects that produce goods ranging from silk to meat.": "鸟人栖息地的农业是不寻常的。在较高的栖息地中，水果藤和苔藓从树枝上生长。最大且最具生产力的农业栖息地是(Brackenmill)。尽管由于接近地面而被认为是一个较低等的栖息地，但(Brackenmill)仍由许多相邻的树农场组成，经过多年的生长，它们融合在一起。它包括一个商店中心、贸易大厅和装运平台，所有这些都在当地栖息地卫队的监视下。一些农场甚至已经开始向下扩展，包括树木底部的小园艺区。这些地面农场生产无法在树枝上种植的奢侈品，并设有为生产从丝绸到肉类等各种商品的巨型昆虫提供住所的畜栏。",
	"Practically every store, tavern, and supplier in Alderheart gets their goods from Brackenmill. The movement of agricultural products to vendors around the Wood is overseen by a powerful trade guild made up of prominent farm-owning families. The guild is comprised of elected leaders and legacy members from the most noble of these families. Legacy members inherit their position and tend to hold lifetime appointments.": "在奥尔德哈特，几乎每家商店、酒馆和供应商都从布莱肯磨坊购买商品。农产品在伍德周围的供应商之间的流通由一个强大的贸易行会监督，该行会由杰出的农场主家族组成。该行会由选举产生的领导和来自这些家族中最高贵的传承成员组成。传承成员继承他们的职位，并倾向于终身任命。",
	"The Crest is the name given to the mountain range to the northeast of Humblewood. It stands in stark contrast to the green forest at its base with sheer rock faces and huge boulders rising into the sky.": "“山冠”是赫姆布尔森林东北部的山脉的名称。它与其基地的绿色森林形成鲜明对比，有陡峭的岩壁和巨大的巨石冲天而起。",
	"The mountain's severe environment supports a variety of goats and small mammals that feast on hearty shrubbery growing between the crags. There are also several unique creatures native to the Crest. Griffons roost in the peaks and scour a wide territory around the mountain for prey. Basilisks feast on rocks, but have a special preference for creatures they have petrified with their deadly stone gaze. Giant eagles nest atop the highest cliffs, keeping their young safe from lowland predators. Mountain lions, powerful earth-aspected hunters, prey on goats, rodents, and occasionally more monstrous creatures.": "这座山的恶劣环境支持着各种山羊和小型哺乳动物，它们以生长在悬崖间的茂盛灌木为食。山脊上还有几种独特的生物。狮鹫栖息在山峰上，周围广泛地搜寻着山脉附近的猎物。蜥蜴兽以岩石为食，但更喜欢那些被它们致命的石化凝视所石化的生物。巨鹰筑巢于最高的悬崖上，保护它们的幼崽免受低地捕食者的伤害。山狮，强大的地系猎手，捕食山羊、啮齿动物，有时甚至是更加凶恶的生物。",
	"The Crest is dotted with structures built during different points in history by both birdfolk and humblefolk. In addition to garnering interest from archeological teams, some of these mysterious ruins have become home to a handful of intrepid folk who have taken to life in this dangerous and remote place.": "山冠上点缀着不同时期由鸟人和谦卑人建造的建筑物。除了引起考古团队的兴趣外，一些神秘的废墟已经成为一些勇敢的人的家园，他们开始适应在这个危险而偏远的地方生活。",
	"An old tale relates how the Amaranthine Altus was challenged to a contest of strength by a giant made from living rock. To achieve victory, Altus is said to have lifted the earth up with his talons, proving his might and creating the mountains. In some versions, the frustrated giant challenges Altus to several rematches. They travel across the face of Everden, raising higher and higher peaks, until all the mountains in the world are created. Every adaptation agrees: Altus is always victorious, and is given dominion over the high summits of the world. The snowy, harsh environment of the mountains is said to be directly influenced by Altus, the Amaranthine of storms.": "一个古老的传说讲述了永恒之巅(Amaranthine Altus)被一个由活石头制成的巨人挑战力量比赛的故事。为了取得胜利，据说永恒之巅用他的爪子抬起大地，证明了他的力量并创造了山脉。在一些版本中，沮丧的巨人挑战永恒之巅进行了几次复赛。他们穿越埃弗登(Everden)的大地，创造越来越高的山峰，直到世界上所有的山脉都被创造出来。每个版本都一致认为：永恒之巅总是获胜，并被赋予了对世界高峰的统治权。据说，山脉的雪白、恶劣环境直接受到了风暴之永恒(Amaranthine of storms)永恒之巅的影响。",
	"It is a wonder that such a lush, expansive forest sits at the foot of these blustry peaks. Experts theorize that the formidable bulwark of rock helped the Wood thrive by shielding it from the bitter, salty winds of the ocean.": "这样一片郁郁葱葱、广袤无垠的森林竟然坐落在这些多风的山脚下，真是令人惊叹。专家们推测，这道坚固的岩石屏障帮助森林茁壮成长，使其免受海洋中刺骨咸风的侵袭。",
	"In the south of the forest is a small perch known as Marshview. One of the most unconventional perches, Marshview is extremely disconnected from the goings on of the Wood. The location has basic amenities, like shops and an inn, but it is not a prime destination for travelers. Residents eye visitors with a mix of curiosity and suspicion, but are ultimately a kind and welcoming folk.": "在森林的南部有一个被称为(`Marshview`)的小栖息地。作为最不寻常的栖息地之一，(`Marshview`)与森林中的事务极为脱节。这个地方有基本的设施，如商店和客栈，但并不是旅行者的首选目的地。居民们对访客充满了好奇和怀疑，但最终是善良而热情的人。",
	"A balanced mix of birdfolk and humblefolk inhabitants results in architecture unique to Marshview. A reflection of its population, walkways and staircases are more common here than in other birdfolk settlements. Several buildings are on the ground, and traditional farming takes advantage of the limited dry ground between the forest and the nearby swamp.": "在Marshview，鸟人和谦卑族居民的平衡混合导致了独特的建筑风格。作为人口的反映，在这里，步道和楼梯比其他鸟人定居点更常见。几座建筑物位于地面上，传统农业利用了森林和附近沼泽之间有限的干燥土地。",
	"Meadowfen is a peaceful village located between the Mokk Fields to the south and a glade of spruce copses to the north. It is a humble village, with a small number of residents. Most are farmers who work either the ash-enriched pastures to the north, or the marshlands to the south, which are ripe with sour berries and waterborne plants. Meadowfen has been quiet for as long as anyone can remember, and life here goes by slowly. Its closeness to the marsh keeps it safe from attacks by emberbats and other fire-based creatures from the Scorched Grove. Its distance from the Mokk Fields ensures deadly slimes don't stray into the village.": "莽原沼泽 (Meadowfen) 是一个宁静的村庄，位于南部的莫克田野 (Mokk Fields) 和北部的云杉林地之间。这是一个朴素的村庄，居民数量不多。大多数是农民，他们在北部富含灰分的牧场或南部的沼泽地工作，那里长满了酸浆果和水生植物。莽原沼泽在人们记忆中一直很安静，生活在这里过得很慢。它靠近沼泽，使其免受来自焦土林地 (Scorched Grove) 的火蝙蝠和其他火系生物的袭击。它远离莫克田野，确保致命的粘液不会进入村庄。",
	"The confluence of dozens of streams and runoff flows have pooled within the southwestern lowlands of Humblewood, creating a vast wetland. The water here gradually filters out to the Talongrip Coast and into the sea. Before it does, the still, muddy freshwater reservoirs allow the Mokk Fields to support a surprising array of life.": "数十条小溪和径流的汇合在(`Humblewood`)的西南低地形成了一个广阔的湿地。这里的水逐渐流向(`Talongrip Coast`)，最终进入大海。在水流入海之前，静止、混浊的淡水水库让(`Mokk Fields`)支持了各种生命的存在。",
	"The fringes of the Mokk Fields are wreathed with reeds, water lilies, and pleasant greenery. Farther into the heart of the swamp, travelers find themselves inundated by stagnant, foul-smelling waters and muddy lowlands with poor footholds. Patches of dry stable ground are scarce, meaning that the slimy, gnarled trees that grow here are rarely suitable to support a perch.": "莫克原野(Mokk Fields)的边缘被芦苇、睡莲和宜人的绿色植被环绕。走进沼泽的深处，旅行者会发现自己被停滞、恶臭的水域和泥泞的低地所淹没，脚下的支撑很差。干燥稳定的地面很少，这意味着这里生长的黏滑、扭曲的树木很少适合支撑栖息地。",
	"he Mokk Fields are not a popular travel destination, especially for birdfolk accustomed to towering trees and bustling perches. Still, some venture here seeking the area's unique resources. Plants and creatures found only in the swamp are useful for potion brewing or magical reagents, and there is good coin to be made for people willing to brave the area's many dangers. Of special note are the slimes, dangerous ooze creatures exclusive to this environment, whose residue has become a sought-after commodity for those with the skill to harvest it.": "莫克原野并不是一个受欢迎的旅游目的地，尤其对于习惯于高耸树木和繁忙栖息地的鸟人来说。然而，仍有一些人冒险前来寻找这个地区独特的资源。只有在沼泽中才能找到的植物和生物对于酿造药水或制作魔法药剂非常有用，对于愿意冒险面对这个地区众多危险的人来说，也能赚取可观的金币。特别值得一提的是，这里有一种叫做（slimes）的危险软泥生物，是这个环境独有的，其残留物已经成为那些有技能收集它的人追捧的商品。",
	"One of the more unlikely landforms of the Mokk Fields is the intricate, vast cavern system that runs beneath the swamps. Years ago, what was thought to be sinkholes were revealed to in fact be tunnel entrances to a series of caves. Scouts from Winnowing Reach have probed the depths to learn more about these caverns. The few who have returned reported a significant number of slimes. The damp, lightless caverns make a perfect home for the amorphous creatures that dwell here.": "莫克原野（Mokk Fields）中一种更不太可能的地貌是位于沼泽下方的错综复杂、广阔的洞穴系统。多年前，被认为是天坑的地方实际上被揭示为通往一系列洞穴的隧道入口。来自（Winnowing Reach）的侦察员深入探索这些洞穴的深处以了解更多信息。少数回来的人报告称发现了大量的史莱姆。潮湿、无光的洞穴为栖息在这里的无定形生物提供了完美的栖息地。",
	"History shows there was serious disagreement over the founding of Saltar's Port. For many birdfolk, the idea of building a city on the ground is laughable in itself, but to build on the rocky coastline with the express intent of sailing ships was considered a gross misuse of resources. After heated debates, a group of birdfolk broke off and founded the port city on their own. The rift between the inhabitants of the Port and the rest of the Wood took many years to mend, and the relationship is still tense at times.": "历史显示，关于建立(Saltar's Port)的争议非常严重。对于许多鸟人来说，在地面上建造一座城市本身就是可笑的想法，更别提在多岩石海岸线上建造，还要打造船只，这被认为是对资源的严重浪费。经过激烈的辩论，一群鸟人分裂出去，自行建立了这座港口城市。港口居民与木之其他居民之间的裂痕花了许多年才得以修补，而两者之间的关系有时仍然很紧张。",
	"Saltar's Port serves as the only access for ships coming to or leaving from Humblewood. It has sparked a vibrant trade business, offering the riches of the Wood to faroff cities and kingdoms. The port has also opened up Humblewood to overseas visitors and migrants, causing concern among the more consevative birdfolk.": "盐港（Saltar's Port）是进出谦林（Humblewood）的船只唯一通道。它催生了繁荣的贸易业务，向遥远的城市和王国提供了谦林的财富。这个港口也让谦林向海外游客和移民敞开了大门，引起了更保守的飞禽族群的担忧。",
	"Centuries ago, the area known as the Scorched Grove was once a lush forest of calm meadows and peaceful glades. Then, the Great Calamity came: a massive forest fire that swept through the Grove and reduced it to a smoldering, ashen plain. The Grove refused to heal. Stranger still, the soil beneath the ashen steppes still smolders with embers. The air here carries a supernatural heat which can exhaust travelers or even cause burns depending on its fierceness. This hostile landscape is home to a variety of curious fire-aspected creatures. Certain species, now considered native to Humblewood, only appeared after the Great Calamity. Most notable are the emberbats, which roost in the safety of the Grove during the day.": "数个世纪前，被称为焦林的地区曾经是一片郁郁葱葱的森林，有宁静的草地和宁静的林地。然后，大灾难来临了：一场巨大的森林大火席卷了整个林地，将其化为一片冒着烟的灰烬平原。焦林拒绝复原。更奇怪的是，灰烬平原下的土壤仍然闪烁着余烬。这里的空气带有一种超自然的热量，可以让旅行者筋疲力尽，甚至根据其炽烈程度造成灼伤。这片充满敌意的景观是各种奇特的火属性生物的家园。某些物种，现在被认为是谦林的本地物种，只在大灾难之后出现。其中最引人注目的是灰燕蝠，它们在白天栖息在焦林的安全之处。",
	"Accounts of the great blaze have been recorded in Humblewood's history books, but the exact cause of the Great Calamity remains a mystery. The soils of the Grove were tested and found to be distinctively suited to channeling evocation energy, especially when used with fire spells. It was also discovered that the fire-aspected creatures of the Grove have extra-planar origins, giving rise to the theory that the Calamity was caused by magic. A popular myth told by forest-dwellers alleges that the Calamity was caused by the appearance of a great primal being of fire and destruction, which visited its wrath upon the Wood and then vanished as mysteriously as it arrived.": "在《(Humblewood)谦林》的历史书中记录了大火灾的事迹，但“大灾变”的确切原因仍然是个谜。对林地的土壤进行了测试，发现它们非常适合引导附魔能量，尤其是在施放火系法术时。还发现了林地中火属性生物具有外域起源，从而产生了一个理论，即灾变是由魔法引起的。一个广为流传的神话故事是，森林居民声称，灾变是由一位伟大的原始火焰和毁灭之神的出现引起的，它带来了愤怒，然后神秘地消失得就像它来时一样。",
	"Whatever its origins, the fire devastated the area and displaced thousands of beasts and people from their homes. While the inhabitants of the Humblewood know that the death and rebirth is part of the natural order of the Wood, the Calamity that befell the Grove was clearly unnatural.": "无论其起源如何，这场大火摧毁了该地区，迫使成千上万的野兽和人们离开他们的家园。尽管《（Humblewood）谦卑森林》的居民知道死亡和重生是森林自然秩序的一部分，但降临在林地上的灾难显然是不自然的。",
	"Each year, the Grove pushes on the boundary of the forest, growing slightly as its edges are set ablaze by windblown embers or fire-infused creatures. The expansion of the Grove leaves the newly-burned areas similarly affected, experiencing the supernatural qualities of the Grove. This gradual spread has increased with a recent spate of forest fires, making those who study the Grove nervous.": "每年，（The Grove）（森林之地）都在森林边界上推进，边缘被风吹过的余烬或火焰生物点燃而略微扩张。（The Grove）（森林之地）的扩张使新烧毁的区域受到类似影响，经历（The Grove）（森林之地）的超自然特质。这种逐渐蔓延的现象随着最近一系列森林火灾而加剧，使研究（The Grove）（森林之地）的人感到紧张。",
	"The Scorched Grove is cared for by a conclave of mystics and druids known as the Tenders. Many Tenders are talented thinkers and practitioners of natural magic, who have dedicated their lives to understanding the nature of the Calamity's effect on the Grove and healing the damage it has caused. They believe that through study and communion with nature, the natural balance of the energy in the wood can be restored, healing the Grove back into the tranquil forest it once was.": "焦土林由一群被称为守护者(Tenders)的秘教士和德鲁伊照料。许多守护者是天赋异禀的思想家和自然魔法的实践者，他们将生命奉献给了解灾变对林地的影响以及治愈它所造成的破坏。他们相信通过研究和与自然的交流，可以恢复木材中能量的自然平衡，将林地治愈成曾经的宁静森林。",
	"There is much debate about the intent and success of the Tenders. High-society perch-dwellers are inclined to think of the Tenders as nothing more than \"odd-birds,\" embarking on a fool's errand. These detractors claim that the Scorched Grove is simply a quirk of Humblewood's natural magic. Much of the populace agrees with this point of view, despite educated claims to the contrary. Still, given the affinity between nature and the cultures of the Wood, Tenders are generally respected for the care and reverence they give to the forest.": "对于《烬木谷》(Scorched Grove)的意图和成功，存在着很多争论。高社会的栖息者倾向于将《烬木谷》(Scorched Grove)视为不过是一群“怪鸟”，在进行一场愚蠢的冒险。这些批评者声称，《烬木谷》(Scorched Grove)只不过是《谦木》(Humblewood)自然魔法的一种怪癖。尽管有教育背景的人提出相反的观点，但大部分民众仍然同意这种观点。然而，鉴于自然与《森林》(the Wood)文化之间的亲和性，人们普遍尊重《烬木谷》(Scorched Grove)使者(Tenders)对森林的关怀和崇敬。",
	"The perches of Talongrip Coast stand in stark contrast to their woodland counterparts, often rising from cliff faces, salt-blasted trees, and jagged rocks jutting from the sea. These small settlements are sparsely decorated, focusing on stability and protection from the salty winds of the ocean. Homes are chiseled out of the rock faces, with wooden platforms serving as walkways between them. On more vertical slopes, buildings are connected by a veritable forest of ropes and cables used to get from place to place.": "塔隆握海岸的栖息地与森林中的栖息地形成鲜明对比，常常从悬崖、被海水冲刷的树木和从海中突出的尖锐岩石上升起。这些小型定居点装饰简约，注重稳定性和抵御海洋盐风的保护。房屋是从岩石表面凿出来的，木制平台用作它们之间的人行道。在更陡峭的斜坡上，建筑物通过一片绳索和电缆的森林相连，用于在各处之间移动。",
	"Citizens of coastal perches and villages are primarily folk who wish to remain close to the water. Sea raptors, mapachs, and jerbeens have carved out space for themselves along the coast, sometimes literally. These seaside settlements focus on fishing and salt drying, exporting their cured fish to the rest of the Wood.": "沿海高地和村庄的居民主要是那些希望保持靠近水域的人。海鹰、地图獾和杰宾已经在沿海创造了自己的空间，有时甚至是字面上的。这些海滨定居点专注于捕鱼和晒盐，将他们腌制的鱼出口到木之地的其他地方。",
	"The weather here is volatile. It can turn from clear and sunny to black and stormy with one gust of the wind. Most of the coast's inhabitants can spot these changes easily, knowing when to retreat to shelters. Living near the shore means enduring the occasional hurricane, windstorm, and tidal wave. Those who make the coast their home are known for resilience.": "这里的天气变化无常。一阵风就能让晴朗的天空变得乌云密布、暴风骤雨。大部分沿海居民能够轻易察觉这些变化，知道何时撤退到庇护所。居住在海岸附近意味着要忍受偶尔的飓风、风暴和海啸。那些把海岸当做家园的人以坚韧著称。",
	"A number of dangers face the people who live along the coastline. Large predatory lizards hunt and scavenge the sandy shores, and giant crabs have been known to drag victims to a watery grave. Rarest of all are the dreaded wakewyrms. Most professional fishing outfits employ hunters to stand guard, and guides and mercenaries are often hired by merchants hauling goods across the treacherous coastways. Those who wish to avoid the cost of protection can attempt the journey alone, but many grim fables describe foolish travelers who were too stingy to take the proper precautions.": "沿海居民面临着许多危险。大型掠食性蜥蜴在沙滩上觅食和觅食，巨大的螃蟹也会将受害者拖入水中。最罕见的是可怕的梦醒兽。大多数专业渔业公司雇佣猎人站岗，向导和雇佣兵经常被雇佣来保护商人穿越这些充满危险的海岸线。那些希望避免保护费用的人可以尝试独自旅行，但许多可怕的寓言描述了那些太吝啬以采取适当预防措施的愚蠢旅行者。",
	"Winnowing Reach is a relatively new development in the Wood. It started as a modest outpost, a last stop for researchers and slime-wranglers bound for the Mokk Fields. When folk began disappearing in the swamp, it was decreed that a more permanent settlement be constructed to hold a small contingent of Perch Guard. To this end, the perch was hastily constructed within a small stand of willow trees. In contrast to standard perches, a decent portion of the homes and facilities here were built entirely on the ground. This closeness to the earth creates a feeling of unease and general distaste for birdfolk accustomed to the high perches, but the other races that make up the population appreciate the easier access to research stations and support buildings.": "在木（Wood）中，Winnowing Reach是一个相对较新的发展。它起初只是一个简陋的前哨站，是前往莫克（Mokk）领地的研究人员和粘液捕捉者的最后一站。当有人开始在沼泽中消失时，人们决定建造一个更为永久的定居点，以容纳一小部分Perch（(Perch Guard)栖息者）卫兵。为此，栖木（perch）被匆忙建造在一小片柳树林中。与标准栖木不同，这里的相当一部分住宅和设施完全建在地面上。这种接近大地的感觉让习惯于高栖木的鸟人们感到不安和厌恶，但组成人口的其他种族却欣赏这种更容易接近研究站和支持建筑物的便利。",
	"South-west of the Winnowing Reach are the damp slime-filled caves of the Mokkden Caverns. Initially considered a hindrance, slimes quickly became a valuable export for the Reach. Thanks to the profits from slime-wrangling, Winnowing Reach has grown to include businesses specializing in harvesting and shipping slime residue. The trade is mainly with the Avium for educational, research, and experimental purposes, but other buyers are appearing at a steady pace. Alchemists across the Wood find the substances useful in a variety of potions, and some healers are beginning to test the medicinal application of various slime-based concoctions.": "在Winnowing Reach的西南方是Mokkden Caverns（莫克登洞穴）的潮湿充满黏液的洞穴。最初被视为一种阻碍，但黏液很快成为了Reach的一种有价值的出口。由于从捕捉黏液中获得的利润，Winnowing Reach已经发展壮大，包括专门从事收割和运输黏液残留物的企业。这种贸易主要是与Avium（艾维姆）进行的，用于教育、研究和实验目的，但其他买家也在稳步增长。整个Wood（伍德）的炼金术士发现这些物质在各种药水中非常有用，一些医治者开始测试各种基于黏液的混合物的药用应用。",

Dockmasters take their marine jobs very seriously.": "在索尔塔港口看到鸟人在码头和船只上工作可能有些奇怪，但对一些人来说，海洋是一种生活方式。航海业的工作既有利可图又艰苦。对于选择在水上工作的鸟人来说，生活是关于秩序和效率的。一个未正确储存的桶或牢固系缚的绳索可能在海上引发灾难。码头管理员非常认真对待他们的海洋工作。",
	"Simple farmers can be found across the Wood, providing necessary food and supplies to the cities. There are many places in Humblewood where digging up large heaps of soil would either be impractical or damaging to the forest. While traditional farms exists in Humblewood, the majority of farms are built in the canopies in or around cities. Farming in the canopy consists of growing flowering moss gardens or fruit-bearing vines on the branches of perch trees. Canopy farms can also include the raising of large insects for food, or silkworms for clothing.": "在木林中可以找到简单的农民，他们为城市提供必要的食物和物资。在Humblewood有许多地方，挖掘大量土壤堆要么不切实际，要么会对森林造成破坏。尽管Humblewood存在传统农场，但大多数农场建在城市内或周围的树冠中。树冠中的农场包括在栖木树枝上种植开花苔藓花园或结果实藤蔓。树冠农场还可以包括饲养大型昆虫以供食用，或者养蚕虫以制作服装。",

	"Birdfolk ship design often causes confusion among other seafaring races due to the relative absence of rigging. While cordage is needed to keep sails in place and cargo stored, nets and climbing ropes prove less necessary when the crew is capable of limited flight.

The leader of the Bandit Coalition, she is an idealist who believes that Alderheart's canopy, the symbol of birdfolk power in the region, should be burned and its resources looted to help those displaced by the flames. Benna lived a tranquil village life until her mother, a respected village elder and seer, foretold that the flames would come. Word was sent to Alderheart's Council, asking for supplies and aid, both of which were denied because the Council didn't believe in the power of the seer's visions. When the flames had all but consumed the village, birdfolk support arrived, but it was too late. Benna lost her family.
