	"Theros possesses a unique metaphysical property: things believed and dreamed here eventually become real. The collective unconscious of mortal people has the literal power of creation, though the process unfolds over the course of countless centuries. Thus, the gods of Theros and their servants were believed, dreamed, and narrated into existence, materializing and becoming fully real as a result of mortal belief in their power. As stories were told, sacrifices made, and devotion given over ages, the gods formed and gained lives just as real as the mortals who dreamed them into being.": "泰罗斯拥有一个独特的形而上学属性：在这里相信和梦想的东西最终会变成现实。凡人的集体无意识具有创造的字面力量，尽管这个过程在无数个世纪中展开。因此，特洛斯的神和他们的仆人被相信、梦想和叙述，由于凡人对他们的力量的信仰，他们变成了物质并完全成为现实。随着故事的讲述、祭祀的进行和历代的奉献，诸神形成并获得了与梦想他们存在的凡人一样真实的生命。",
	"Does that mean that the gods of Theros are less powerful or less divine than the gods of other worlds? Not at all. Once a dream or belief in Theros becomes reality, it is just as real as any other thing, and the gods have been real for a very long time. The people of Theros believe them to be divine, ageless, and all-powerful, and therefore they are.": "这是否意味着特洛斯的神灵不如其他世界的神灵强大或神圣？一点也不。一旦在Theros的梦想或信仰成为现实，它就和其他事物一样真实，而众神在很长一段时间内都是真实的。特洛斯的人们相信他们是神圣的、不老的和全能的，因此他们就是如此。",
	"A single individual can't do anything to make the gods less real or change the nature of a god. Threatened with the wrath of Heliod, for example, a mortal can't simply \"disbelieve\" the god out of existence or turn his wrath to kindness. It's the collective unconscious of every sapient being on Theros that shapes reality, and changes to that reality occur on the scale of ages, not moments.": "一个人不能做任何事情来使诸神不那么真实或改变神的性质。例如，受到赫利奥德之怒的威胁，一个凡人不能简单地 \"不相信 \"神的存在或将他的愤怒转化为仁慈。塑造现实的是Theros上每一个有智慧的生命的集体无意识，而对现实的改变是以年代为单位发生的，而不是瞬间。",
	"In practical terms, then, the gods of Theros are no less real, powerful, or important to Theros than the gods of other worlds are to those worlds. Notably, though, these gods have influence only over Theros and the two planes connected to it: Nyx, the starry realm of the gods, and the Underworld, eventual home of all die.": "那么，从实际情况来看，特洛斯的诸神对特洛斯的真实性、力量或重要性并不亚于其他世界的诸神对这些世界的重要性。但值得注意的是，这些神只对特洛斯和与之相连的两个星球有影响力。Nyx，众神的星界，以及冥界，所有死亡的最终归宿。",
	"The central conflict in Theros is among gods, striving against each other over the devotion of mortals. Mortal devotion equates to divine power: when people fervently pray to a god, when they piously observe the god's rites and sacrifices, and when they devoutly trust in the god's divine might, the god becomes more powerful.": "泰罗斯的核心冲突是诸神之间的冲突，他们为了争夺凡人的奉献而互相争斗。凡人的奉献等同于神力：当人们热切地向一个神祈祷时，当他们虔诚地遵守该神的仪式和祭祀时，当他们虔诚地相信该神的神力时，该神就变得更加强大。",
	"The competition for mortal devotion isn't necessarily a zero-sum game. The people of Theros don't believe in one particular god to the exclusion of others, and the most pious people pray to all the gods with equal fervor. But a deity's goal is to increase the number of people who, when faced with peril, will call on that god for help. It's that trust, that reliance, that faith that gives the gods their power, not merely ideas and concepts.": "对凡人奉献的竞争不一定是零和游戏。塞洛斯的人们不会因为相信某个特定的神而排斥其他的神，最虔诚的人也会以同样的热情向所有的神灵祈祷。但一个神的目标是增加在面临危险时向该神求助的人的数量。正是这种信任，这种依赖，这种信仰赋予了神灵力量，而不仅仅是思想和概念。",
	"Mortal beings—heroes and monsters alike—often become unwitting pawns in the contests of the gods. Having a powerful champion is an indication of a god's power—and can potentially increase the god's own power. A champion who acts as an agent of a god among other people helps increase those people's devotion to the god. And if a hero should happen to strike down the agents of a rival god along the way, all the better.": "凡人--英雄和怪物--往往会在不知不觉中成为众神争夺的棋子。拥有一个强大的冠军是一个神的力量的体现，并有可能增加神自身的力量。冠军在其他人中充当神的代理人，有助于增加这些人对神的虔诚。如果一个英雄碰巧在途中击倒了对手的神的代理人，那就更好了。",
	"Two closely related concepts loom large in the way mortals think about their place in the world: fate and destiny.": "在凡人思考他们在这个世界上的位置的方式中，有两个密切相关的概念：命运和宿命。",
	"The idea of fate is that the course of each mortal's life is predetermined, spun out in a tapestry woven by a trio of semidivine women, the Fates. Gods aren't bound by the strands of fate, their lives and legends constantly changing and endlessly uncertain. In the case of most mortals, it's thought they plod along their predetermined path from beginning to end, carrying out the tasks appointed for them until they complete their journey to the Underworld.": "命运的概念是，每个凡人的生活轨迹都是预先确定的，由三位半神的女人--命运女神--织成的挂毯来纺出。神灵不受命运之线的约束，他们的生活和传说不断变化，无尽地不确定。就大多数凡人而言，人们认为他们自始至终沿着预定的道路艰难前行，执行指定的任务，直到完成前往冥界的旅程。",
	"This fairly bleak view of existence is undermined by the heroic ideal exemplified in myths, legends, and the lived experience of Theros's people. Heroes, by definition, are people who defy the predetermined course of fate. They take their fate into their own hands and chart their own courses, striding boldly into the unknown, striking down supposedly invincible foes, and resisting the will of gods. Their proud defiance of fate is rewarded when they at last complete their mortal journeys; worthy heroes spend their afterlives in Ilysia, the fairest realm of the Underworld, where they finally rest from the struggle of their lives. In many cases, their works also live on, both in the stories of future generations and repeating in the night sky among the stars of Nyx.": "这种相当暗淡的生存观被神话、传说和塞洛斯人的生活经验中所体现的英雄理想所破坏。根据定义，英雄是藐视命运的预定路线的人。他们把命运掌握在自己手中，规划自己的路线，大胆地走进未知的世界，击倒所谓不可战胜的敌人，并抵制神的意志。当他们最终完成凡人的旅程时，他们对命运的自豪感得到了回报；有价值的英雄在伊利亚度过他们的余生，伊利亚是冥界最美丽的地方，在那里他们终于从生命的挣扎中得到休息。在许多情况下，他们的作品也会继续存在，既存在于后代的故事中，也在尼克斯的星空中重复出现。",
	"Destiny is different. The strands of destiny are spun from the hair of the ancient god Klothys, but they don't chart a predetermined future. Destiny establishes the order of things, the hierarchy of being, the relationship between gods and mortals, the instincts and impulses that govern mortal behavior, and other aspects of the way things are. Gods and mortals alike are constrained by the threads of destiny. Mortals can do little to alter them, but more than once the arrogance and presumption of the gods have caused the strands of destiny to become tangled. The god Klothys enforces the bounds of destiny. She isn't only the spinner of destiny's strands but also an avenging fury, punishing the foolhardy gods who tangle them.": "命运是不同的。命运之丝是从古神克洛蒂斯的头发中纺出来的，但它们并没有描绘出一个预定的未来。命运确立了事物的秩序、存在的等级、神与凡人之间的关系、支配凡人行为的本能和冲动，以及事物存在方式的其他方面。神灵和凡人都受到命运之线的制约。凡人几乎无法改变它们，但诸神的傲慢和自以为是不止一次导致了命运之线的纠缠。Klothys神执行着命运的界限。她不仅是命运之线的编织者，也是复仇的怒火，惩罚那些纠缠它们的愚蠢的神。",
	"The champions of the gods number among some of the most influential and inspirational figures in Theros. These mortals have personal relationships with the gods, potentially serving as divine agents in the world or being compelled to action by immortal schemes. Still others were born with divine gazes set upon them, whether due to their remarkable abilities or the circumstances of their birth. Through their lives, champions experience the blessings and curses of their divine relationships. Some might brandish incredible powers granted to them by the gods. Others, however, discover how fickle and vindictive the gods can be. How a champion contends with the whims of a deific patron defines what makes them a hero, whether they seek incredible ways to court immortal favor or forge a path that throws off the bonds of destiny. Regardless of the course they choose, the deeds of champions influence belief in the gods, but even more so, they fill the hearts of Theros's people with hope and wonder.": "众神的拥护者是特洛斯中最有影响力和鼓舞人心的人物。这些凡人与诸神有私人关系，有可能在这个世界上充当神圣的代理人，或者被不朽的计划所蛊惑而采取行动。还有一些人一出生就被神的目光注视着，无论是由于他们杰出的能力还是他们出生的环境。通过他们的生活，冠军们经历了他们神圣关系的祝福和诅咒。有些人可能会挥舞着诸神赐予他们的不可思议的力量。然而，其他人则发现神明是多么善变和报复。冠军如何与神灵赞助人的奇思妙想相抗衡，决定了他们成为英雄的原因，无论他们是寻求不可思议的方法来争取不朽的青睐，还是开辟一条抛开命运束缚的道路。无论他们选择什么样的道路，冠军的行为都会影响对神的信仰，但更重要的是，他们让特洛斯人的心中充满了希望和好奇。",
	"The heroes illustrated throughout this introduction are examples of heroic archetypes. The General, the Protector, the Vanquisher, the Hunter, the Provider, the Warrior, the Slayer, the Philosopher, and others like them are idealized figures who appear in narrative and theatrical drama—sometimes with personal names attached, but often without. Tales describe the Slayer destroying a hydra... and a mighty cyclops, and a dragon, and a Nyxborn giant, and a lamia, and any number of other creatures. Did one Slayer do all that? No, the archetype has become the repository for legends about many different heroes, all of whom are notable primarily for slaying something.": "本导论中所描述的英雄是英雄原型的例子。将军、保护者、征服者、猎人、供应者、战士、杀手、哲学家，以及其他类似的人，都是出现在叙事和戏剧中的理想化人物--有时附带个人姓名，但往往没有。传说中，杀手摧毁了九头蛇......还有强大的独眼巨人、龙、Nyxborn巨人和拉米亚，以及任何数量的其他生物。一个杀手做到了所有这些吗？不，这个原型已经成为许多不同英雄的传说的宝库，所有这些人都主要因为杀死了什么而引人注目。",
	"The heroes of a Theros campaign might aspire to emulate one of the great heroic archetypes, or they might strive to forge an entirely new mythic identity, to be remembered by name in tales of glory forever.": "Theros战役的英雄们可能渴望效仿某个伟大的英雄原型，或者他们可能努力打造一个全新的神话身份，在荣耀的故事中永远记住名字。",
	"When storytellers relate the history of Theros, they always speak in the most general terms. An event of just ten years past happened \"many years ago,\" and the founding of Meletis in the distant past happened \"many, many years ago.\" In Theros, history transforms into myth more quickly than it does in other worlds, becoming generalized, vague, and moralistic. And because the gods are so deeply involved in mortal affairs, it's often impossible to distinguish between the myths of divine activities and the scraps of historical fact in these records.": "当讲故事的人讲述Theros的历史时，他们总是用最笼统的术语说话。一个十年前的事件发生在 \"许多年前\"，而在遥远的过去，Meletis的建立发生在 \"许多、许多年前\"。在Theros，历史比其他世界更快转化为神话，变得笼统、模糊和道德主义。而且由于诸神对凡人事务的参与如此之深，所以往往无法区分神性活动的神话和这些记录中的历史事实的碎片。",
	"Human history vaguely recalls an era just before the birth of modern human civilization, called the Age of Trax. This semi-mythical era, nestled several centuries back in the fog of historical memory, is marked by the rule of supernatural beings called archons.": "人类历史依稀记得，在现代人类文明诞生之前有一个时代，叫做特拉克斯时代。这个半神话的时代，在历史记忆的迷雾中停留了几个世纪，其特点是被称为archons的超自然生物的统治。",
	"The archons of Trax are said to have come from unknown lands to the north and established a heavy-handed rule over the humanoids of Theros. Many peoples remember this as a time of oppressive servitude, when they were forced into the armies of the tyrant Agnomakhos. The archons dubiously suggested that their rule actually protected the weaker species—centaurs, humans, leonin, minotaurs, and satyrs—from the dangers of far more powerful beings. Giants, demons, and medusas are said to have ruled kingdoms of their own in those days, and tales tell of Agnomakhos leading his leonin soldiers to repel an invading army of giants. Dragons, krakens, and hydras are also said to have grown to even greater size in those days than they do now, annihilating whole nations and carving untold catastrophes across the land.": "据说Trax的弓箭手来自北方未知的土地，并对Theros的人族建立了强硬的统治。在许多人的记忆中，这是个压迫性的奴役时期，他们被迫加入暴君阿诺玛科斯的军队。大主教们疑惑地表示，他们的统治实际上是在保护较弱的物种--半人马、人类、利安人、牛头人和萨提尔--免受更强大生命的危险。巨人、恶魔和梅杜莎人据说在那些日子里统治着自己的王国，传说阿诺玛科斯带领他的利安人士兵击退了入侵的巨人军队。龙、克拉肯和水蛇据说在那个时代甚至比现在还大，它们消灭了整个国家，并在这片土地上造成了难以形容的灾难。",
	"The end of the Age of Trax corresponds roughly with the rise of the fourth and latest generation of gods, whose interests lie in the application of more abstract principles to the realities of mortal life. Three of these gods—Ephara, Iroas, and Karametra—played significant roles in the establishment of human civilization, in opposition to the archons.": "特拉克斯时代的结束与第四代和最新一代神的崛起大致相符，他们的兴趣在于将更抽象的原则应用于凡人的现实生活中。其中三位神--埃法拉、伊罗亚斯和卡拉米拉--在建立人类文明的过程中发挥了重要作用，与大神们对立。",
	"The goddess Ephara inspired and equipped two human heroes, Kynaios and Tiro, to overthrow the archon Agnomakhos. Divergent tales describe their history following the defeat of the tyrant. Some claim that they warred with each other for control over the region and that only their eventual death paved the way for the peace that allowed the new polis of Meletis to flourish. The truth is that they ruled Meletis peacefully together, established its legal code, and defended it for decades.": "女神Ephara启发并装备了两位人类英雄，Kynaios和Tiro，推翻了大君Agnomakhos。不同的故事描述了他们打败暴君后的历史。有些人声称他们为了控制该地区而互相争斗，只有他们的最终死亡才为和平铺平了道路，使新的梅里提斯政体得以繁荣发展。事实是，他们一起和平地统治了Meletis，建立了它的法律规范，并捍卫了它几十年。",
	"After the fall of Agnomakhos and the other archons of Trax, humans and minotaurs waged a bloody war in the highlands. The poleis of Akros and Skophos were born from that bloodshed, inspired by the martial doctrines of Iroas and Mogis rather than the legal code of Ephara. Eventually the years of war settled into an uneasy peace with the badlands of Phoberos as a barrier separating the poleis from each other.": "在阿格诺玛科斯和特拉克斯的其他大主教倒台后，人类和牛头人在高地发动了一场血腥的战争。阿克罗斯（Akros）和斯科福斯（Skophos）这两个城市就是从那场流血事件中诞生的，它们受到伊罗亚斯（Iroas）和莫吉斯（Mogis）的武术学说而不是埃法拉的法律规范的启发。最终，多年的战争沉淀为一种不安的和平，菲比罗斯的坏境成为分隔各极地的屏障。",
	"Meletis, Akros, and Skophos perpetuated the stark division between civilization and nature that was inherent in the archons' rule. While most humans (and minotaurs) embraced that division, the god Karametra tried to teach people a new way of living in harmony with nature, leading to the founding of Setessa.": "Meletis、Akros和Skophos延续了弓箭手统治中固有的文明与自然之间的严酷划分。当大多数人类（和牛头人）拥护这种分裂时，卡拉米特拉神试图教导人们一种与自然和谐相处的新方式，从而导致了塞特萨的成立。",
	"The uncounted centuries since the fall of the archons have been marked by the exploits of great heroes, many of which are recorded in works of epic prose and poetry. Three major narratives remain widely retold and studied: {@i The Akroan War}, {@i The Callapheia}, and {@i The Theriad}.": "自大帝陨落以来的无数个世纪里，伟大的英雄们的功绩一直是他们的标志，其中许多被记录在史诗般的散文和诗歌作品中。三个主要的叙事仍然被广泛地复述和研究。{@i The Akroan War}, {@i The Callapheia}, 和 {@i The Theriad}。",
	"The epic tale of the Akroan War is only nominally a history of the long siege of Akros, precipitated by the queen of Olantin abandoning her husband and going to live with the Akroan king. With the war as a backdrop, a nameless poet spins tales of gods and heroes, victories and tragedies. The death of the triton queen Korinna, and the resulting birth of the Dakra Isles from Thassa's falling tears, is a tale told incidentally, by way of comparison to the grief of the Olantian king. The tale of Phenax escaping from the Underworld is told to explain the origin of a phalanx of the Returned that comes to fight alongside the Olantian forces. And when the sphinx oracle Medomai appears and foretells the fall of Olantin, the poet tells of Medomai's earlier prophecy of the destruction of Alephne—a tragedy that could have been averted had anyone believed the sphinx's dire warning.": "阿克罗斯战争的史诗故事只是名义上的阿克罗斯长期被围困的历史，其导火索是奥兰丁的女王抛弃了她的丈夫，去和阿克罗斯的国王一起生活。以战争为背景，一位无名诗人讲述了神和英雄、胜利和悲剧的故事。特里顿女王科林娜之死，以及由此产生的达克拉群岛从塔萨落下的眼泪中诞生，是一个偶然讲述的故事，与奥兰特国王的悲痛形成对比。Phenax逃出冥界的故事是为了解释与奥兰帝国军队并肩作战的回归者法阵的起源。当狮身人面像的神谕Medomai出现并预言奥兰丁的灭亡时，诗人讲述了Medomai先前对Alephne的毁灭的预言--如果有人相信狮身人面像的可怕警告，这个悲剧本可以避免的。",
	"{@i The Theriad} is a different sort of epic, closely associated with the worship of Heliod. At a glance, it appears to be about a champion of Heliod who is never named but simply called \"the Champion.\" A closer read, though, reveals that the tales take place over the span of centuries and the identity of the Champion changes from tale to tale. In fact, {@i The Theriad} is a compilation of tales describing the exploits of many different champions of the sun god. It is widely believed that some tales are actually prophecies of champions yet to come.": "{@i The Theriad}是一部不同的史诗，与对赫利奥德的崇拜密切相关。乍一看，它似乎是关于赫利奥德的一个冠军的故事，他从未被命名，而只是被称为 \"冠军\"。但仔细阅读后会发现，这些故事发生在几个世纪之前，冠军的身份在各个故事中都有变化。事实上，{@i The Theriad}是一个故事汇编，描述了太阳神的许多不同冠军的功绩。人们普遍认为，有些故事实际上是对尚未到来的冠军的预言。",
	"Like white-hot bronze on the smith's anvil, Theros is ready to be forged by the deeds of today's heroes and ushered into the next great era of its history.": "就像铁砧上的白热青铜，特洛斯已经准备好被今天的英雄们的事迹所锻造，并进入其历史的下一个伟大时代。",
	"Theros is not the most cosmopolitan of worlds, and a relatively small number of languages are used in its lands and sea. The citizens of the three human poleis (Meletis, Akros, and Setessa) speak their own dialects of the Common language, mutually intelligible but just different enough to identify the speaker's native land. Leonin and minotaurs have their own languages, and tritons speak the Aquan dialect of Primordial. Centaurs and satyrs speak distinct dialects of Sylvan, and different bands of centaurs even pronounce the same words differently. Giants and cyclopes share one language. Dragons and sphinxes have distinct languages rarely spoken among mortals of Theros, and the gods themselves speak in a unique language that few beyond mortal oracles can understand.": "泰罗斯不是最国际化的世界，在它的土地和海洋上使用的语言数量相对较少。三个人类聚居地（Meletis、Akros和Setessa）的公民讲他们自己的通用语方言，可以相互理解，但又有足够的差异，以识别说话者的故乡。莱昂宁和牛头人有他们自己的语言，三头人说阿奎安的原始方言。半人马和萨提尔说着不同的西尔凡方言，不同的半人马族群甚至对相同的单词有不同的发音。巨人和独眼巨人共用一种语言。龙和狮身人面像有独特的语言，在特洛斯的凡人中很少有人说，而诸神本身也用一种独特的语言说话，除了凡人的神谕之外，很少有人能听懂。",

Is it a matter of fate, spun out in the strands of a divine tapestry, charting the course of a hero's life from miraculous birth to glorious end?": "是什么造就了英雄？它是一种使一些凡人高于其他人的出生质量吗？它是诸神的祝福吗？它是否是一个命运问题，在神圣的挂毯上旋转出来，描绘出一个英雄从奇迹般的诞生到光荣的结束的生命历程？",
	"This chapter describes playable races of Theros, new subclass options, a new background, and their places in the world. It also includes a description of the supernatural gifts that set the heroes of Theros above the ordinary mortals of their world. But it begins with the question of what makes {@i your} character a hero.": "本章描述了特洛斯的可玩种族、新的子类选项、新的背景以及他们在世界中的位置。它还包括对超自然天赋的描述，这些天赋使塞洛斯的英雄们超越了他们世界中的普通凡人。但它是以什么使{@i your}角色成为英雄的问题开始的。",
	"The defining characteristic of a hero in Theros is their heroic drive—the force that impels them to live a life worthy of great epics. Ordinary mortals across the multiverse are driven to extraordinary deeds when they are called on to pursue their ideals, to protect their bonds, and to overcome their flaws. In Theros, heroic drive stems from the same sources, but the power of fate and myth destines every character for legend; all one must do is act and discover their own immortal tale.": "泰罗斯的英雄的决定性特征是他们的英雄驱动力--推动他们过上与伟大史诗相称的生活的力量。整个多元宇宙中的普通凡人在被要求追求他们的理想、保护他们的纽带和克服他们的缺陷时，都会被驱使做出非凡的事迹。在塞洛斯，英雄的动力来自同样的来源，但命运和神话的力量注定了每个角色都会成为传奇；人们必须做的就是采取行动，发现他们自己的不朽故事。",
	"Many characters' ideals come directly from their service to a god. Each god's description in {@book chapter 2|MOT|2} includes a table you can use to determine your hero's ideal if your character serves that god, instead of (or in addition to) an ideal derived from your background. But whether your character holds to one of those ideals, one from the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} or another source, or one of your own invention, try to state your ideal in the grandest possible terms to express your character's heroic drive.": "许多角色的理想直接来自他们对某个神的服务。{@book chapter 2|MOT|2}中每个神的描述都包括一个表格，如果你的角色为该神服务，你可以用它来确定你的英雄的理想，而不是（或除此之外）从你的背景中得出的理想。但是，无论你的角色是坚持这些理想中的一个，还是来自（%%）或其他来源的一个，或者是你自己发明的一个，都要尽量用最宏大的词语来表达你的理想，以表达你的角色的英雄气概。",
	"The connections and goals that serve as characters' bonds are powerful motivators, all the more so when they have supernatural origin or possess mythological weight. As with your character's ideal, think on a legendary scale as you define your character's bonds.": "作为人物纽带的联系和目标是强大的激励因素，如果它们有超自然的起源或具有神话般的分量，那就更有意义。就像你的角色的理想一样，在定义你的角色的纽带时要考虑到传奇的规模。",
	"What if a person mentioned in your bond is actually a god? Consider this twist on a bond from the urchin background in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}: \"I owe my survival to Phenax, god of thieves, who taught me to live on the streets while disguised as another mortal urchin.\" In this case, the secret divine identity of the person in the bond makes the bond more significant.": "如果你的债券中提到的一个人实际上是一个神呢？考虑一下这个来自{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的顽童背景的债券的转折。\"我的生存要归功于盗贼之神Phenax，他教我在伪装成另一个凡人顽童时在街上生活。\" 在这种情况下，纽带中人的秘密神性身份使纽带的意义更加重大。",
	"The heroes of Theros don't often conform to tidy definitions of heroic morality and virtue, and they are often laid low by their own flaws. The {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} encourages you to think of \"anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests.\" For a hero in Theros, a tragic flaw is something that the gods themselves might exploit or punish, with hubris being the classic example.": "塞洛斯的英雄们并不经常符合英雄道德和美德的整齐定义，他们经常被自己的缺陷所压倒。{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}鼓励你想一想 \"任何别人可以利用的东西，使你走向毁灭或使你的行为违背你的最佳利益。\" 对于特洛斯的英雄来说，悲剧性的缺陷是诸神本身可能利用或惩罚的东西，傲慢是典型的例子。",
	"The gods of Theros aren't so concerned about \"ordinary\" flaws like addiction or laziness. Rather, consider a tragic flaw involving something you don't want a god to learn or certain to provoke a god's anger.": "瑟罗的诸神并不那么关心 \"普通 \"的缺陷，如成瘾或懒惰。相反，考虑一个悲剧性的缺陷，涉及到你不想让神明知道的事情，或者肯定会激起神明的愤怒。",
	"For example, some of the flaws listed for the outlander background in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} could put a character into conflict with a god. \"I remember every insult I've received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who's ever wronged me\" could cause significant problems when the character nurses a grudge against a god.": "例如，{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中列出的外乡人背景的一些缺陷可能使角色与神发生冲突。\"我记得我受到的每一次侮辱，并对任何曾经伤害过我的人养成一种无声的怨恨\"，当这个人物对一个神灵怀恨在心时，可能会造成重大问题。",
	"A tragic flaw can also be supernatural in nature. A hermit who harbors \"dark, bloodthirsty thoughts that my isolation and meditation failed to quell\" might have a sinister connection to the vicious god Mogis.": "悲剧性的缺陷也可以是超自然的。一个隐士怀有 \"黑暗、嗜血的想法，我的隔离和冥想未能平息\"，他可能与凶恶的莫吉斯神有邪恶的联系。",
	"The birth of a hero is often accompanied by signs in Nyx and Theros alike. You can use the Omens table in {@book chapter 4|MOT|4|Omens} to randomly determine an omen that appeared when you were born. It's up to you and your DM to determine the omen's meaning.": "在Nyx和Theros都一样，英雄的诞生往往伴随着预兆。你可以使用{@book chapter 4|MOT|4|Omens}中的预兆表来随机确定你出生时出现的预兆。这取决于你和你的DM来决定这个预兆的含义。",
	"Most heroes of Theros have some kind of supernatural aid to help them achieve their goals. Often this aid comes from the gods, but some heroes might find their support from other beings, such as the sphinx Medomai, an oracle like Atris or Kydele, or a repository of mystical knowledge. Some heroes are born with supernatural power or born as a result of supernatural events.": "泰罗斯的大多数英雄都有某种超自然的援助来帮助他们实现自己的目标。这种帮助通常来自诸神，但有些英雄可能会从其他生物那里找到他们的支持，比如狮身人面像麦多麦、像阿特里斯或凯德勒这样的神谕，或者是神秘知识的宝库。有些英雄生来就有超自然的力量，或因超自然的事件而诞生。",
	"A character in Theros begins with one supernatural gift chosen from those in this section. Work with the DM to decide where your character's gift came from. Is it tied to the god you serve? Was it the result of a fateful encounter with a sphinx or an oracle? Does it indicate the nature of your birth? Each gift's description also includes a table to spark your imagination as you think about your character's gift.": "在Theros中，一个角色开始时拥有一个从本节中选择的超自然的天赋。与DM一起决定你的角色的天赋从何而来。它是否与你所服务的神有关？它是与狮身人面像或神谕的宿命相遇的结果吗？它是否表明你的出生性质？每个天赋的描述都包括一个表格，当你思考你的角色的天赋时，可以激发你的想象力。",
	"These supernatural gifts are intended for starting characters, but some might be bestowed by gods as rewards for remarkable deeds.": "这些超自然的礼物是为起始角色准备的，但有些可能是神明赐予的，作为对杰出行为的奖励。",
	"If your campaign uses the optional feat rules from {@book chapter 6|PHB|6|Feats} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, your Dungeon Master might allow you to take a feat as a variant supernatural gift. You gain one feat of your choice. This list suggests twelve feats from the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, but you can choose any feat your DM allows:": "如果你的竞选活动使用了{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}的可选特技规则，你的地下城主可能会允许你把一项特技作为一种变异的超自然天赋。你会获得一个你选择的特技。这个列表推荐了{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的12个特技，但你可以选择你的管理员所允许的任何特技。",
	"A snake emerged from my mouth before I took my first breath—an omen of my gift for deception. ({@feat Actor})": "在我第一次呼吸之前，一条蛇从我的嘴里冒了出来--预示着我有欺骗的天赋。({@feat Actor})",

	"I was bathed in the waters of a mystic river that left my skin resistant to harm—and glittering with starlight. ({@feat Tough})": "我沐浴在神秘的河水中，使我的皮肤不受伤害--而且闪烁着星光。({@feat Tough})",
	"The world of Theros is alive with myths. From stories about the deeds of gods that explain the workings of the world to inspirational (or cautionary) tales of heroes, remarkable tales spread in countless ways, be they diversions, lessons, or songs. Just as in Theros, throughout this book you'll find numerous tales of great deeds, magical origins, grim tragedies, and more. In each case, such myths appear in sidebars like \"Myth of the First Kings of Meletis.\" These cues note the legendary places these stories occupy in the minds of Theros's people and their place as tales that endlessly play out among the constellations of Nyx.": "塞洛斯的世界充满了神话。从解释世界运作的诸神事迹的故事到英雄的励志（或警世）故事，非凡的故事以无数种方式传播，无论是消遣、教训还是歌曲。就像在泰罗斯一样，在本书中，你会发现无数关于伟大的事迹、神奇的起源、残酷的悲剧等等的故事。在每一种情况下，这样的神话都会出现在侧边栏中，如 \"梅莱蒂斯的第一个国王的神话\"。这些提示指出了这些故事在塞洛斯人心中所占据的传奇地位，以及它们作为故事在尼克斯的星座中无休止地上演的地位。",
	"Myth of the First Kings of Meletis": "梅莱蒂斯第一代国王的神话",
	"In ages past, the peoples of what would one day become Meletis were ruled by the archon tyrant Agnomakhos. Unchecked for generations, the vicious overlord carved out a mighty empire. Willing to endure the immortal's cruelty no longer, the heroes Kynaios and Tiro—united by their love of freedom and one another—rose to challenge him. The people rallied to their cause, and through strength of arms, magic, and devotion, they defeated Agnomakhos. The polis of Meletis rose from the ruins of the archon's empire, established as a beacon of freedom and enlightenment, and its people chose Kynaios and Tiro to be its first kings.": "在过去的岁月里，有朝一日会成为Meletis的人民被大法官暴君阿诺玛科斯统治着。在几代人的努力下，这个邪恶的霸主建立了一个强大的帝国。由于不愿再忍受不朽者的残忍，英雄凯奈奥斯和蒂罗--他们因对自由和彼此的爱而团结起来--起来挑战他。人们团结在他们的事业上，通过武器的力量、魔法和奉献，他们打败了阿格诺玛科斯。Meletis的政体从拱门帝国的废墟中崛起，被确立为自由和启蒙的灯塔，它的人民选择Kynaios和Tiro作为它的第一个国王。",
	"A diverse assortment of peoples dwell among the lands of Theros. Aside from humans, the races in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} are unknown on Theros, unless they're visiting from other worlds.": "在塞洛斯的土地上居住着各种各样的人。除了人类之外，{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的种族在塞洛斯是未知的，除非他们是从其他世界来的。",
	"This chapter provides information about the following common playable races of Theros, as well as racial traits for all of them except humans:": "本章提供了关于以下常见的可玩种族的信息，以及除人类以外的所有种族的种族特征。",
	"{@race Human||Humans} on Theros are similar to those found on other D&D worlds: adaptable, ambitious, and wildly diverse.": "{@race Human||Humans}，与其他D&D世界中的人相似：适应性强，雄心勃勃，而且疯狂的多样化。",

	"{@race Minotaur|MOT|Minotaurs} are infamous for bloodthirstiness, a reputation even the most peaceful struggle to escape.": "{@race Minotaur|MOT|Minotaurs}因嗜血而臭名昭著，即使是最和平的人也要努力摆脱这种声誉。",
	"{@race Satyr|MOT|Satyrs} follow their passions in the pursuit of wild revels and new adventures.": "{@race Satyr|MOT|Satyrs}追随他们的激情，追求疯狂的狂欢和新的冒险。",
	"{@race Triton|MOT|Tritons} are an enigmatic, sea-dwelling people with an endless desire to explore.": "{@race Triton|MOT|Tritons}是一个神秘的、居住在海里的民族，对探索有着无尽的渴望。",
	"The most numerous of Theros's mortal races, humans embody the mortal will to carve out a place for civilization from the wilds. Although other, smaller settlements exist, the majority of humans are associated with one of Theros's three major poleis: Meletis, Akros, and Setessa.": "人类是Theros中数量最多的凡人种族，他们体现了凡人的意志，即从荒野中开辟出一片文明之地。尽管还有其他更小的定居点存在，但大多数人类都与特洛斯的三个主要聚居地之一有关。Meletis、Akros和Setessa。",
	"Human names tend to honor heroes or philosophers of old—an aspirational nudge from parent to child in the hope that their offspring might one day live up to such a storied name.": "人类的名字往往是为了纪念古代的英雄或哲学家--这是父母对孩子的一种激励，希望他们的后代有朝一日能够达到这样一个传奇的名字。",
	"Family surnames are uncommon in the human poleis, and people with the same name must find ways to distinguish themselves from one another. Some attach their place of birth or residence to their own names. A merchant from Meletis named Brigone, for example, would be Brigone of Meletis. Others link their name to their trade, like Ristos the Learned, or Alesta the Hunter.": "姓氏在人类的极乐世界中并不常见，同名同姓的人必须想办法将自己与他人区分开来。有些人把自己的出生地或居住地附在自己的名字上。例如，一个来自Meletis的商人名叫Brigone，他将成为Meletis的Brigone。其他人则将他们的名字与他们的行业联系在一起，如博学者里斯托斯，或猎人阿莱斯塔。",
	"The most prestigious names however, are those earned through deeds or temperament. These names typically mark heroes, such as Hypatia of the Winged Horse, Kalogeros Doomhammer, or Ianthe the Bold.": "然而，最著名的名字是那些通过事迹或气质赢得的名字。这些名字通常标志着英雄，如翼马的希帕蒂亚、卡洛格罗斯-毁灭之锤或勇敢的伊安特。",

	"Remarkable individuals from all walks of life seek their destinies among the lands of Theros, from devout servants of the gods, to triumph-hungry athletes.": "来自各行各业的杰出人士在特洛斯的土地上寻求他们的命运，从虔诚的神的仆人，到渴望胜利的运动员。",
	"While the heroes of Theros might come from any of the backgrounds presented in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, the gods have a way of interceding in the lives of those meant for greatness. When determining your character's backstory, consider how the gods have influenced your life. The gods are pervasive in the stories and cultures of Theros, and even their devout followers shouldn't feel bound to choose a faith-focused background like acolyte. The gods' followers come from all walks of life, and any heroic soul might find themselves thrust into the midst of divine schemes.": "虽然Theros的英雄们可能来自{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中所介绍的任何背景，但诸神有办法在那些注定伟大的人的生命中进行干预。在确定你的角色的背景故事时，考虑诸神如何影响了你的生活。众神在塞洛斯的故事和文化中无处不在，即使是他们虔诚的追随者也不应该觉得必须选择像圣职者这样以信仰为中心的背景。诸神的追随者来自各行各业，任何一个英雄的灵魂都可能发现自己被推入了神圣的计划之中。",
	"Whether or not your character is exceptionally devout, consider reviewing the deities presented in {@book chapter 2|MOT|2|Gods of Theros} and see if you gravitate toward one. Perhaps this god has a special interest in you, is the deity your family has hailed as a patron for generations, or embodies values you hold close. Based on this, consider that chapter's possibilities for how you might have earned that immortal's favor (if indeed you have) and alternate background ideals related to their worship—along with other boons that might entice you into their service.": "无论你的角色是否特别虔诚，考虑回顾一下{@book chapter 2|MOT|2|Gods of Theros}中介绍的神明，看看你是否倾向于其中一个。也许这个神灵对你有特殊的兴趣，是你的家族世代称颂的守护神，或者体现了你所坚持的价值观。在此基础上，考虑该章中关于你如何赢得该神灵青睐的可能性（如果你确实有的话），以及与他们的崇拜有关的其他背景理想--还有可能吸引你为他们服务的其他好处。",
	"Your character doesn't need to be a follower of any of the gods, but if you're not, there's likely a reason why you've avoided them.": "你的角色不需要是任何一个神的追随者，但如果你不是，你很可能有理由避开他们。",
	"In addition to the gods, the supernatural gifts presented earlier in this chapter might influence your background. Consider what story emerges from your combination of supernatural gift, background, and other choices.": "除了诸神之外，本章前面介绍的超自然天赋也可能影响你的背景。考虑一下你的超自然天赋、背景和其他选择的组合会产生什么故事。",
	"Beyond these options, the {@background athlete|MOT} background presented here provides a new way to seek glory through discipline and physical prowess.": "除了这些选择之外，这里介绍的{@background athlete|MOT}背景提供了一种通过纪律和体能寻求荣耀的新方法。",
	"Myths of the Iroan Games": "伊洛尼亚运动会的神话",
	"Competitors seeking a place among the athletes of legend endlessly push themselves to claim victory during Akros's world-renowned annual contest, the Iroan Games. The deeds of past victors set a high bar for those who follow.": "在阿克罗斯举世闻名的年度比赛--伊洛安运动会中，寻求在传奇运动员中占有一席之地的竞争者们无休止地鞭策自己以获得胜利。过去的胜利者的事迹为后来者设立了一个高标准。",

	"When the pankratiast Nymosyne had her contest interrupted by a cyclops attack, she threw her rival at the creature, then snapped the brute's neck with her bare hands.": "当潘格拉特-尼莫西恩的比赛被独眼巨人的攻击打断时，她把她的对手扔给了那个生物，然后徒手拧断了那个畜生的脖子。",
	"Perhaps most dramatically, though, was the recent victory of the Akroan hunter Arissa. While waiting to claim her second place award, Arissa witnessed a Nyxborn bat-creature snatch an infant from the crowd. The hunter threw her javelin an impossible distance, skewered the bat-thing, then caught the child as it fell. Collectively, the other assembled competitors gave Arissa their awards, and the hunter claimed her citizenship among the Akroan lektoi.": "不过，最引人注目的也许是最近阿克罗安猎人阿里萨的胜利。在等待领取第二名的奖项时，阿里萨目睹了一个Nyxborn蝙蝠生物从人群中抢走一个婴儿。猎人把她的标枪扔出了一个不可能的距离，刺穿了蝙蝠生物，然后在孩子落下时接住了他。其他参赛者集体给阿里萨颁奖，而这位猎人则声称自己是阿克罗安莱克托伊人的一员。",
	"Who knows what legends will unfold during next year's Iroan Games?": "谁知道在明年的伊罗安运动会期间会有什么传奇故事发生？",
	"A bird shrieked as it took flight from a branch above her. Through the gaps in the rustling canopy, she could see the god-forms shift in and out of focus. The night sky was known as Nyx, the realm of the gods. Every night, the heavens displayed fleeting visions of gods and celestial creatures. Some lingered for just seconds. But sometimes the pantheon enacted entire scenes for mortal eyes to witness. Lidia rarely took time to step outside her home and watch the heavens, but now there was no place else to rest her eyes. Tonight the god-forms were vivid, and her heart beat faster as she watched their battle unfold.": "一只鸟尖叫着从她上方的树枝上飞了起来。透过沙沙作响的树冠的缝隙，她可以看到神灵的身影在焦距内移动。夜空被称为Nyx，是众神的领域。每天晚上，天空中都会出现神和天体的短暂幻象。有些只停留了几秒钟。但有时万神殿也会为凡人的眼睛展示整个场景。莉迪亚很少花时间走出家门观看天象，但现在她没有别的地方可以休息了。今晚，神的形态栩栩如生，当她看着他们的战斗展开时，她的心跳加速。",
	"A pantheon of fifteen gods guides religious life on Theros. From the sun and agriculture to death and passage into the Underworld, the gods oversee the forces of nature and the most important aspects of mortal life. These gods are quite real to the people of Theros, who see them moving across the sky at night and sometimes encounter them face to face. Thus, most people perform rituals and devotions that honor various gods, hoping to win their favor and stave off their wrath. They tell and retell the stories of the gods' deeds—even as they watch those stories continue to play out in the vastness of the night sky.": "一个由15位神组成的万神殿指导着特洛斯的宗教生活。从太阳和农业到死亡和进入冥界，众神监督着自然的力量和凡人生活的最重要方面。这些神对特洛斯的人们来说是相当真实的，他们在夜晚看到他们在天空中移动，有时会与他们面对面地相遇。因此，大多数人都会举行仪式和奉献，向各种神灵致敬，希望能赢得他们的青睐，避免他们的愤怒。他们讲述和复述诸神的事迹--甚至当他们看着这些故事在浩瀚的夜空中继续上演。",
	"Not every mortal serves or acknowledges the gods, though. Some philosophers in the schools of Meletis teach that the gods of the pantheon are subordinate to a higher reality, perhaps Nyx itself. And other people, particularly leonin, believe that the gods are undeserving of mortal reverence.": "不过，并不是每个凡人都侍奉或承认诸神。梅里提斯学校的一些哲学家教导说，万神殿的诸神从属于一个更高的现实，也许是尼克斯本身。而另一些人，尤其是利安人，认为诸神不值得凡人敬仰。",
	"The gods of Theros are far more active than the deities of most D&D worlds. But that doesn't mean they are ordinary creatures—they aren't mere mortals, nor are they monsters that can be fought.": "泰罗斯的神灵比大多数D&D世界的神灵要活跃得多。但这并不意味着他们是普通生物--他们不是普通的凡人，也不是可以战斗的怪兽。",
	"Further, the gods of Theros aren't omnipotent. Although they are physically and magically powerful, ageless, and all but indestructible, their actions are bound by the decrees of Klothys. They can tangle the threads of destiny to a point, but they are forbidden from overstepping their assigned places in the pantheon. The god Kruphix is able to confine them to Nyx, preventing any direct interaction between the gods and the mortal world.": "此外，塞洛斯的诸神并不是万能的。虽然他们在身体和魔法上都很强大，不老，而且几乎是不可摧毁的，但他们的行动却受到Klothys法令的约束。他们可以在一定程度上纠缠命运之线，但他们被禁止超越他们在万神殿中的指定位置。Kruphix神能够将他们限制在Nyx，防止诸神与凡人世界之间的任何直接互动。",
	"Likewise, the gods aren't omniscient, though they see and hear everything that occurs inside their temples and before their altars. They have perfect recall of everything they experience. Certain liminal spaces—cave mouths, shorelines, crossroads, forest edges, and so on—enable mortal voices to reach the gods as well, though most gods have little reason to pay attention to what is spoken there.": "同样，众神也不是全知全能的，尽管他们能看到和听到在他们的庙宇和祭坛前发生的一切。他们对自己经历的一切都有完美的记忆。某些边缘空间--洞口、海岸线、十字路口、森林边缘等等--使凡人的声音也能传到神灵那里，尽管大多数神灵没有什么理由去注意那里所说的内容。",
	"Gods can speak directly to their oracles. They can appear in the dreams of mortals or manipulate natural phenomena to create omens. They can also create Nyxborn creatures to serve as messengers or emissaries.": "神明可以直接与他们的神谕对话。他们可以出现在凡人的梦中，或操纵自然现象以创造预兆。他们还可以创造Nyxborn生物，作为信使或使者。",
	"Gods grant their clerics the ability to cast spells, and they can effortlessly duplicate the effect of any spell they could grant (any spell on the cleric spell list, as well as any domain spell from their domains). They also have broad influence over aspects of the world associated with their portfolios, beyond what can be defined by spell effects. For example, Purphoros can make a volcano erupt, and Thassa can call up a tidal wave. Gods can bestow supernatural blessings on mortals, and they can lay terrible curses (such as when Mogis turned a herd of cattle into catoblepases).": "神赋予他们的牧师施法的能力，他们可以毫不费力地复制他们所能赋予的任何法术的效果（牧师法术列表中的任何法术，以及他们领域中的任何领域法术）。他们对与他们的组合相关的世界的各个方面也有广泛的影响，超出了法术效果所能定义的范围。例如，Purphoros可以使火山喷发，Thassa可以召唤出潮汐。神灵可以将超自然的祝福赐予凡人，他们也可以下可怕的诅咒（比如莫吉斯将一群牛变成了猫鼬）。",
	"The gods can assume any form they choose. They most commonly appear as humanoids—the form in which the people of Theros most easily imagine them—but on an enormous scale. They often seem to be walking across the dome of the sky, with their feet disappearing just below the horizon. Any part of a god's body that isn't directly lit takes on the appearance of the starry night sky of Nyx. The gods sometimes also appear as animals or magical creatures, or they manifest in insubstantial forms like sunlight or wind.": "众神可以采取他们选择的任何形式。他们最常见的是以人形出现--这是特洛斯人最容易想象的形式，但规模巨大。他们常常似乎在天空的穹顶上行走，他们的脚就在地平线下消失。神身上任何没有被直接照亮的部分都会呈现出Nyx的星空的样子。众神有时也会以动物或魔法生物的形式出现，或者以阳光或风等非实体的形式显现出来。",
	"When physically present in the mortal world, a god is capable of devastating physical attacks. Heliod's spear striking the polis of Olantin caused it to sink forever into the sea, and an errant blow from Purphoros's hammer shaped the mountains.": "当身体出现在凡人世界时，神能够进行毁灭性的物理攻击。赫利奥德的长矛击中了奥兰丁的城市，使其永远沉入大海，而普尔福罗斯的锤子的错误打击则塑造了山脉。",
	"The power of the gods exceeds that of any mortal being. Even so, a god killing another god—let alone a mortal attempting the task—is virtually inconceivable. Any kind of direct confrontation against a god by mortals would require the assistance of at least one other god, and ideally more than one, to have any hope of success. A group of adventurers might try to convince a group of gods to lend their aid against a god who has become a threat to the mortal world, hoping to get the gods to band together to restrain or punish the offender. Kruphix or Klothys might be able to force a god into a physical form that doesn't fill the sky (perhaps something similar to an {@creature empyrean} or the {@creature tarrasque}), which could enable adventurers to battle the god, especially if they have access to a divine weapon like the artifacts detailed in {@book chapter 5|MOT|5}. But defeating the god in that form would merely weaken the deity, allowing other members of the pantheon to capture, bind, or punish them.": "神的力量超过了任何凡人的力量。即便如此，一个神杀死另一个神--更不用说一个凡人试图完成这项任务--几乎是不可想象的。凡人对神的任何直接对抗都需要至少一个其他神的协助，最好是一个以上，才有成功的希望。一群冒险者可能会试图说服一群神灵对一个已经对凡人世界构成威胁的神灵伸出援手，希望让神灵们联合起来限制或惩罚犯罪者。Kruphix或Klothys也许能够迫使神变成一个不充满天空的实体形态（也许是类似于{@creature empyrean}或{@creature tarrasque}的东西），这可以使冒险者与神战斗，特别是如果他们能够获得像{@book chapter 5|MOT|5}中详述的神器那样的神器。但以这种形式击败神灵只会削弱神灵的力量，使万神殿的其他成员能够捕获、束缚或惩罚他们。",
	"The pantheon of Theros is a family—a large, often dysfunctional family riven with petty jealousies and rivalries but also held together by genuine affection, admiration, and cooperation. It is easiest, after all, for mortals to conceive of gods that are very much like themselves, and the gods of Theros are very humanlike in their foibles and their exploits.": "泰罗斯的万神殿是一个家庭--一个经常因小的嫉妒和竞争而功能失调的大家庭，但也因真正的爱戴、钦佩和合作而团结在一起。毕竟，对于凡人来说，最容易想到的是和自己非常相似的神，而特洛斯的神在他们的缺点和他们的功绩方面都非常像人类。",
	"The pantheon of Theros has expanded through four generations of divine evolution. Some tales describe these as actual generations, suggesting (for example) that the storm god, Keranos, is the literal son of Thassa, god of the sea, and Purphoros, god of the forge. Others describe the generations in metaphorical terms, suggesting that Keranos represents the combination of Purphoros's creative energy and Thassa's deep knowledge, resulting in lightning-like flashes of inspiration (as well as the fury of a physical storm). In all their various forms, though, the myths agree on the basic structure of the pantheon's development.": "泰罗斯的万神殿经过四代的神性演变而不断扩大。一些故事将这些描述为实际的世代，暗示（例如）风暴之神凯拉诺斯是海神塔萨和锻造之神珀弗洛斯的儿子。还有人以隐喻的方式描述这几代人，认为凯拉诺斯代表了普尔福罗斯的创造能量和塔萨的深刻知识的结合，从而产生了闪电般的灵感火花（以及物理风暴的愤怒）。不过，在其所有不同的形式中，这些神话在万神殿发展的基本结构上是一致的。",
	"The time of the first generation precedes the presence of what are commonly understood to be \"gods.\" Before mortals dreamed the gods into being, before they could even imagine beings as noble as the gods, the malleable dream-substance of Nyx gave shape to their fears in the form of the titans.": "第一代的时间早于通常被理解为 \"神 \"的存在。在凡人梦见诸神之前，在他们甚至可以想象像诸神一样高贵的生命之前，尼克斯的可塑性梦境物质以泰坦的形式为他们的恐惧提供了形状。",
	"The titans were beings of utter chaos, representing everything that stands against order in the mortal world, never worshiped but sometimes appeased. Myths recount how the gods battled and imprisoned the titans, sealing them in a prison beneath the Underworld. Now the titans are all but forgotten in mortal imagination. Scant mention of their names and epithets appears in the oldest tales, hinting at the nightmares that birthed them. Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger, embodied the terror of death—and its insatiable gluttony for new creatures to consume. Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, might be seen as a direct predecessor of Keranos and Thassa, but it was the incarnation of natural disaster, having none of the creativity and thoughtfulness of those gods. Phlage, Titan of Burning Wind, was an all-consuming whirlwind of fire, and Skotha, Titan of Eternal Dark, was the utter darkness of the starless night.": "泰坦是完全混乱的生物，代表了凡间一切反对秩序的东西，从不被崇拜，但有时会被安抚。神话讲述了诸神如何与泰坦作战并将其囚禁，将其封在冥界下面的监狱中。现在，在凡人的想象中，泰坦巨人几乎被遗忘。最古老的故事中很少提到他们的名字和外号，暗示着孕育他们的噩梦。Kroxa，死亡饥饿的泰坦，体现了死亡的恐怖--以及它对新生物的贪得无厌的消耗。自然之怒的泰坦乌洛可能被视为凯拉诺斯和萨萨的直接前身，但它是自然灾害的化身，没有那些神的创造力和思考力。燃烧之风的泰坦Phlage是一股无孔不入的火旋风，而永恒黑暗的泰坦Skotha则是无星之夜的彻底黑暗。",
	"The oldest of the gods, often imagined as siblings or as some kind of offshoot of the titans, are Kruphix and Klothys. The origin of this second divine generation is mysterious. Perhaps Klothys arose from a sense of inevitability, a notion that the world was unfolding as it must, and thus the actions of mortals made little difference. Kruphix might have been born from a sense of mystery, supporting the idea that the workings of the universe are simply incomprehensible to mortal minds. It's also possible that Kruphix and Klothys are a different order of beings from either the titans or the other gods, and Klothys at least has existed for unknown ages despite being all but forgotten among mortal folk.": "最古老的神灵，通常被想象成兄弟姐妹或泰坦巨人的某种分支，是克鲁普希克斯和克洛特斯。这第二代神灵的起源是神秘的。也许Klothys的出现是出于一种不可避免的感觉，一种世界正按其规律发展的观念，因此，凡人的行为没有什么区别。克鲁普希斯可能是从一种神秘感中诞生的，支持宇宙的运作对凡人的思想来说根本无法理解的观点。也有可能Kruphix和Klothys是与泰坦或其他神不同的生命，而Klothys至少已经存在了不知多少年，尽管在凡人中几乎被遗忘。",
	"Once mortals could imagine a world beyond the horizon and a course of destiny that left behind the trials of life, they could formulate the notions of principles, order, and natural law. Out of those ideas, the third generation of deities was born: sun-crowned Heliod, deep-dwelling Thassa, bleak-hearted Erebos, bronze-blooded Purphoros, and keen-eyed Nylea. These gods are known to refer to each other as \"brother\" and \"sister,\" though they never speak of parents and almost certainly don't imagine Kruphix and Klothys in that role.": "一旦凡人能够想象一个超越地平线的世界和一个抛开生活磨难的命运轨迹，他们就可以提出原则、秩序和自然法的概念。从这些观念中，第三代神灵诞生了：太阳冠的赫利奥德、深居简出的塔萨、心境黯淡的埃雷伯斯、青铜色血液的珀弗洛斯和目光敏锐的奈拉。众所周知，这些神灵相互之间以 \"兄弟 \"和 \"姐妹 \"相称，尽管他们从未谈论过父母，而且几乎可以肯定的是，他们不会把克鲁普希克斯和克洛特斯想象成这个角色。",
	"The other eight deities, the fourth generation, represent the application of abstract principles to the reality of mortal life. For example, while Heliod stands for universal moral precepts, Ephara is the god of laws, the rules and structures that govern mortal societies. Nylea is the god of wild nature, predatory animals, and the change of seasons, and at the same time Karametra is the god of nature tamed for human use—agriculture and domestication—and of the natural cycles involved in human life, especially childbirth.": "其他八位神，即第四代神，代表了抽象原则在凡人生活现实中的应用。例如，赫利奥德代表着普遍的道德戒律，而埃法拉则是法律之神，是管理凡人社会的规则和结构。Nylea是野生自然、掠夺性动物和季节变化之神，同时Karametra是为人类使用而驯服的自然之神--农业和驯化，以及人类生活中涉及的自然周期之神，特别是分娩。",
	"These gods recognize the previous generation as their elders but only occasionally as parents. Iroas and Mogis are widely considered to be brothers, but few myths describe their parentage, and those that do contradict each other—in keeping with the nature of these eternally warring gods.": "这些神承认上一代人是他们的长辈，但只是偶尔承认他们的父母。伊洛亚斯和莫吉斯被广泛认为是兄弟，但很少有神话描述他们的父母身份，而那些描述的神话则相互矛盾--这与这些永恒的战争之神的性质相一致。",
	"The people of Theros don't balk at contradictory myths. Is Keranos the literal child of Thassa and Purphoros? Did he spring unbidden from Thassa's heart when her rage grew too great for her to control? Or did he come into being when Purphoros tried to steal the secrets of Kruphix? To the people of Theros, it doesn't matter whether these tales describe historical facts, and each of them is true in its own way. Each tale about Keranos expresses a truth about the god, about inspiration and storms and secrets. Studying each one can lead Keranos's worshipers to a deeper understanding of and a closer relationship with their god.": "特洛斯的人们对矛盾的神话并不排斥。凯拉诺斯是塔萨和珀弗洛斯的真实孩子吗？他是在塔萨的愤怒变得无法控制时从她的心中不由自主地跳出来的吗？还是当珀弗洛斯试图窃取克鲁普希克斯的秘密时，他才出现的？对特洛斯的人们来说，这些故事是否描述了历史事实并不重要，每一个故事都以它自己的方式是真实的。每个关于凯拉诺斯的故事都表达了关于神的真相，关于灵感和风暴以及秘密。研究每一个故事可以引导凯拉诺斯的崇拜者更深入地了解他们的神，并与他们的神建立更密切的关系。",
	"Various writings, usually organized around a central theme, collect myths about the gods. {@i The Origin of Monsters} is one such collection, notable as an attempt to find commonality in a number of different tales about the birth of dragons. It also describes how Pharika hid secrets in the blood of basilisks, how the spirits of great warriors are reincarnated in the form of manticores, and dozens of other tales.": "各种著作，通常围绕一个中心主题组织，收集关于神的神话。{@i The Origin of Monsters}就是这样一本集子，值得注意的是，它试图从一些关于龙的诞生的不同故事中找到共同点。它还描述了法里卡如何将秘密藏在玄武岩的血液中，伟大战士的灵魂如何以尾兽的形式转世，以及其他几十个故事。",
	"{@i The Callapheia}, by contrast, is about the exploits of a single mortal hero, Callaphe the Mariner, who snuck into Mount Velus and stole Purphoros's tears, hid behind Phenax and wrote down his secrets, and raced Thassa at the edge of the world before sailing into Nyx. Tales of this sort highlight the gods' pettiness and vanity and promote the somewhat blasphemous notion that a mere mortal can outwit the divine. {@i The Callapheia} also serves as something of a gazetteer of Theros, describing its various lands and their inhabitants, at least as they existed some centuries ago.": "{@i The Callapheia}，相比之下，是关于一个凡人英雄的事迹，水手卡拉菲，他潜入维鲁斯山，偷了珀弗洛斯的眼泪，躲在菲纳克斯身后，写下了他的秘密，在世界的边缘与塔萨赛跑，然后驶入尼克斯。这类故事突出了诸神的琐碎和虚荣，并宣扬了一种有点亵渎神灵的观念，即一个普通的凡人可以智取神灵。(1%)也可以作为特洛斯的地名录，描述它的各种土地和居民，至少是几个世纪前的情况。",
	"Finally, the deeds of the gods are sung in paeans during their festivals. Naturally, these hymns portray the gods in the most favorable light, as benevolent (or at least indifferent) and all-powerful.": "最后，诸神的事迹在他们的节日里被唱成颂歌。自然，这些赞美诗以最有利的方式描绘了诸神，即仁慈的（或至少是冷漠的）和全能的。",
	"The idea of the existence of gods, as it grew in popularity among the mortals of Theros, didn't bring the gods into being by itself. Mortal reverence and worship turned universal ideas into deities. It wasn't until mortals trusted the gods to act on their behalf, in response to sacrifices and prayers, that the gods took shape from the dream-substance of Nyx. Worship remains crucial to the power of the gods, though mortals are generally not aware of their influence. Were a god to cease being worshiped, their might would dwindle.": "神灵存在的想法，随着它在特洛斯的凡人中越来越受欢迎，并没有自己带来神灵的存在。凡人的崇敬和崇拜将普遍的想法变成了神明。直到凡人信任众神代表他们行事，对祭品和祈祷做出回应，众神才从Nyx的梦境物质中成形。崇拜对于神的力量仍然至关重要，尽管凡人一般不会意识到他们的影响。如果一个神不再被崇拜，他们的力量就会减弱。",
	"The most prevalent form of expressing reverence is the practice of libation, pouring out a splash of wine or water in honor of the gods. Pious people perform a simple rite of prayer and libation every morning and evening at a household altar or hearth, while the less devoted might still pour out a splash of wine before drinking the rest.": "最普遍的表达敬意的形式是祭奠，即倒出一瓢酒或水来敬奉神灵。虔诚的人们每天早上和晚上在家庭祭坛或壁炉前进行简单的祈祷和酹酒仪式，而不太虔诚的人可能还会在喝剩下的酒之前倒出一瓢酒。",
	"The defining feature of a Theran temple is a statue of a god—which the actual god can occupy and animate at any time. Worshipers kneel before it, touch and kiss it, drape it in garlands and fine cloth, and leave offerings before it. These acts are sometimes spontaneous outpourings of love or gratitude, and sometimes petitions, imploring the god to cure an illness, send rain for crops, guarantee a safe journey, or perform any other favor related to the god's sphere of influence.": "泰兰神庙的决定性特征是一尊神像--真正的神可以在任何时候占据和激活它。崇拜者跪在它面前，触摸和亲吻它，给它戴上花环和细布，并在它面前留下祭品。这些行为有时是自发的爱或感激之情的流露，有时是请求，恳求神灵治病，为庄稼降雨，保证旅途安全，或履行与神灵影响范围有关的任何其他恩惠。",
	"Most people aren't devoted to a single god, though many prefer some gods over others. Someone might ask Pharika to spare a loved one from disease, then later offer prayers to Karametra for a bountiful harvest or to Thassa for safety on a sea journey.": "大多数人并不献身于一个单一的神，尽管许多人喜欢一些神而不是其他神。有人可能会请求法里卡使所爱的人免于疾病，然后再向卡拉米特拉祈祷丰收，或向塔萨祈祷海上航行的安全。",
	"It's far more common for a hero to be devoted to an individual god than it is for an ordinary mortal. A cleric almost always worships a single god of the pantheon and chooses a domain appropriate to that deity for their Divine Domain feature.": "对于一个英雄来说，献身于一个单独的神远比普通的凡人更常见。牧师几乎总是崇拜万神殿中的一个神，并为他们的神域特征选择一个适合该神的领域。",
	"Often, heroes choose to devote themselves to particular gods either out of piety or self-interest. Sometimes, though, the gods choose champions who might not be entirely willing. Heliod, for example, takes pride in selecting only the best mortals to be his champions. He doesn't care how the mortals feel about being chosen, and his demands won't be refused.": "通常情况下，英雄们选择献身于特定的神灵，要么是出于虔诚，要么是出于自身利益。但有时，诸神选择的冠军可能并不完全是自愿的。例如，赫利奥德以只选择最好的凡人作为他的冠军为荣。他并不关心凡人对被选中的感受，他的要求也不会被拒绝。",
	"Most heroes in a Theros campaign, and all clerics, are assumed to devote themselves to a god's cause, acting as that god's champion. All the characters in a party might serve the same god, but more likely, they represent the interests of different gods as they face the dangers of the world together.": "Theros战役中的大多数英雄，以及所有的牧师，都被认为是献身于一个神的事业，充当该神的支持者。一个队伍中的所有角色都可能服务于同一个神，但更可能的是，他们代表不同神的利益，共同面对世界的危险。",

Each god's description in this chapter paints a picture of the god's typical champion, including ideas for how a player character might end up in that position and provides ideals that represent the god's interests.": "成为一个神的拥护者本身没有任何好处。本章中每个神的描述都描绘了该神的典型拥护者的形象，包括玩家角色如何最终成为该职位的想法，并提供代表该神利益的理想。",
	"The gods do reward the devotion of their champions, though. The strength of your devotion to your god is measured by your piety score. As you increase that score, you gain blessings from your god.": "不过，诸神确实奖励他们的冠军的奉献。你对你的神的奉献的强度由你的虔诚分数来衡量。当你增加这个分数时，你就会获得你的神的祝福。",
	"Piety has nothing to do with faith or belief, except insofar as a person's thoughts and ideals drive them to action in a god's service. Your piety score reflects the actions you have taken in your god's service—actions that the god richly rewards.": "虔诚与信仰无关，除非一个人的思想和理想促使他们采取行动为神服务。你的虔诚分数反映了你在神的服务中所采取的行动--神对这些行动给予了丰富的奖励。",
	"When you choose a god to worship as a beginning character, your piety score related to that god is 1. Your piety score increases by 1 when you do something to advance the god's interests or behave in accordance with the god's ideals. The gods expect great deeds from their champions, so your piety score typically increases only when you accomplish a significant goal (such as the completion of an adventure), make a significant sacrifice of your own self-interest, or otherwise when the DM sees fit. Each god's description in this chapter includes a discussion of the god's goals and ideals, which your DM uses to judge whether you earn an increase in your piety score. As a general rule, you can expect to increase your piety by 1 during most sessions of play, assuming that you are following your god's tenets. The DM decides the amount of any increase or decrease, but a single deed typically changes your piety score by only 1 point in either direction unless your action is very significant.": "当你选择一个神作为初始角色进行崇拜时，你与该神相关的虔诚分数是1。当你做了一些促进该神利益的事情或按照该神的理想行事时，你的虔诚分数会增加1。神灵期望他们的拥护者做出伟大的事迹，所以你的虔诚分通常只有在你完成一个重要的目标（比如完成一次冒险），对你自己的利益做出重大牺牲，或在DM认为合适的时候才会增加。本章中每个神的描述都包括对该神的目标和理想的讨论，你的管理员会用它来判断你的虔诚分数是否会增加。一般来说，假设你遵循你的神的信条，你可以在大多数游戏环节中增加你的虔诚度1。DM决定任何增加或减少的数额，但是，除非你的行动非常重要，否则一个行为通常只在任何方向上改变你的虔诚分数1分。",
	"The gods bestow favors on those who prove their devotion. When your piety score crosses certain thresholds—3, 10, 25, and 50—you gain a benefit detailed in the sections describing the gods' champions throughout this chapter. If your piety score exceeds and then falls below one of those thresholds, you lose the benefit you gained at the higher tier.": "诸神会对那些证明自己虔诚的人赐予恩惠。当你的虔诚分数超过某些阈值--3、10、25和50--你就会获得一种好处，详情见本章中描述诸神冠军的章节。如果你的虔诚分数超过了这些门槛，然后又低于其中之一，你就会失去你在较高等级获得的好处。",
	"To some extent, piety is its own reward. Behaving in accordance with your god's dictates and ideals inspires you and might enable you to succeed where you might otherwise fail. At your DM's discretion, whenever you increase your piety score, you might also gain inspiration, reflecting the improvement in the harmony between you and your god.": "在某种程度上，虔诚是它自己的回报。按照你的神的指令和理想行事会激励你，并可能使你在你可能失败的地方取得成功。根据DM的决定，每当你增加你的虔诚分数时，你也可能获得灵感，反映出你和你的神之间和谐的改善。",
	"Not every hero chooses the life of a divine champion. Leonin, in particular, are known for rejecting the worship of gods. If you don't devote yourself to a god, you don't have a piety score and you gain no rewards for piety, but you don't suffer any negative consequences.": "并非每个英雄都选择了神圣的冠军生活。尤其是Leonin，以拒绝对神的崇拜而闻名。如果你不把自己献给一个神，你就没有虔诚的分数，你也不会因为虔诚而获得奖励，但你不会受到任何负面的影响。",

	"If events in your character's adventuring career warrant doing so, you can abandon the service of one god and turn to a different one. Once you abandon a god's service, you can rarely go back without performing some act of contrition.": "如果你的角色的冒险生涯中的事件需要这样做，你可以放弃对一个神的服务而转向另一个。一旦你放弃了一个神的服务，如果不进行一些忏悔的行为，你就很少能再回去。",

	"The world of Theros, as its inhabitants understand, includes three realms: the mortal world, the divine realm of Nyx, and the Underworld. They are three distinct planes of existence, tucked into their own pocket of the multiverse and shielded from the rest of the cosmos by the power of the gods. This chapter discusses each of these realms in turn, with a focus on the mortal realm where the schemes of the gods intersect with mortal lives.": "泰罗斯的世界，正如其居民所理解的那样，包括三个领域：凡人世界、Nyx的神界和冥界。它们是三个截然不同的存在平面，在多元宇宙中被塞进了自己的口袋，并被诸神的力量屏蔽在宇宙的其他部分之外。本章依次讨论了这些领域中的每一个，重点是凡人领域，在那里，诸神的计划与凡人的生活交织在一起。",
	"Compared to most worlds of the Material Plane, the mortal realm of Theros is small. The known world is barely two hundred miles across, with unexplored wilderness beyond. And some unknown distance beyond that is the edge of the world, where the sea flows off the disk of the world and into the starry void.": "与物质界的大多数世界相比，塞洛斯的凡人领域很小。已知的世界仅有两百英里宽，外面是未被开发的荒野。在那之后的一些未知距离是世界的边缘，大海从世界的圆盘上流向星空。",
	"The known world of Theros consists of a long stretch of coastline forming the eastern edge of the vast Siren Sea. Eastward from the sea, the land rises up to two ridges of mountains. The lofty peaks of the second ridge form a barrier that few mortals have passed, so only rumors of a vast forest describe the land beyond.": "塞洛斯的已知世界由一条长长的海岸线组成，形成了广阔的塞壬海的东部边缘。从海的东边开始，陆地上升到两座山脊。第二道山脊的崇高山峰形成了一道屏障，很少有凡人能够通过，所以只有关于广阔森林的传言才会描述到外面的土地。",
	"To the north, the coastal lands become a barren region of badlands crossed by a labyrinth of arid canyons, with minotaur lands beyond. The minotaurs speak of impenetrable mountains rising amid a dark forest to the north.": "在北方，沿海地区变成了一片荒芜的坏境，被干旱峡谷的迷宫所穿过，而牛头人的土地则在后面。牛头人说，在北方的黑暗森林中，有难以逾越的山脉。",
	"The Siren Sea is studded with islands large and small. The largest cluster near the mainland, called the Dakra Isles, is poorly charted, and even those sailors who attempt to explore the isles return with contradictory information. Westward from those islands, some have successfully sailed to the edge of the world, though no one can say for certain how far it is—the journey never unfolds in a straight line. In theory, it is equally possible to sail south to the edge of the world, but those waters are stormier and more forbidding.": "海妖之海布满了大大小小的岛屿。大陆附近最大的岛屿群被称为 \"达克拉群岛\"，其海图绘制得很差，即使是那些试图探索这些岛屿的水手，也会得到相互矛盾的信息。从这些岛屿向西，有些人已经成功地航行到了世界的边缘，尽管没有人能够确定它有多远--旅程从来都是直线展开的。从理论上讲，向南航行到世界的边缘也是同样可能的，但那些水域的风暴更大，也更令人望而却步。",
	"The heart of mortal civilization lies in and around three poleis—cities and their surrounding territories. Together the three poleis, Akros, Meletis, and Setessa, encompass most of the human population of Theros. Meletis covers the whole territory of the southwestern peninsula, Akros forms the northern frontier, and Setessa lies at the northern edge of the wild Nessian Wood.": "凡人文明的核心在于三个poleis--城市和它们周围的领土。Akros、Meletis和Setessa这三个poleis一起包含了Theros的大部分人类人口。Meletis覆盖了整个西南半岛的领土，Akros形成了北部的边界，而Setessa则位于野生Nessian Wood的北部边缘。",

And tritons live primarily in the coastal shallows of the Siren Sea, though some manage to make comfortable homes among the humans of Meletis.": "两支半人马队伍--Lagonna和Pheres--在三座极地之间的山丘和草原上游荡。利安人在奥雷斯科斯山谷狩猎，该山谷坐落在两座山脉之间。萨提尔（Satyrs）居住在内森森林东北部的一个较小的林间谷地。而三头龙主要生活在塞壬海的沿海浅滩，尽管有些人设法在梅里提斯的人类中找到了舒适的家。",

	"Vast and varied lands comprise the world of Theros, from the territories of the great human poleis to the dizzying peaks of the Oraniad Mountains. The line between legend and location often blurs in Theros, though. While the residents of a polis can be relatively certain their homes will remain where they left them when they venture off to work, the specific locations of legendary sites prove more nebulous. Even well-known locations are typically noted referentially, like how the city of Neolantin is often described as being along the coast, far to the southwest of Meletis.": "辽阔而多样的土地构成了塞洛斯的世界，从伟大的人类极地的领土到奥拉尼亚德山脉的令人目眩的山峰。不过，在塞洛斯，传说和地点之间的界限往往很模糊。虽然一个政区的居民可以相对确定，当他们冒险去工作时，他们的家会留在他们离开的地方，但传说中的地点的具体位置证明是比较模糊的。即使是众所周知的地点，通常也是参考性的，比如Neolantin市经常被描述为沿着海岸，远在Meletis的西南方。",
	"Some sites prove even more elusive. The Dakra Isles, for example, move at the whims of the gods and so prove impossible to map.": "有些地方甚至更加难以捉摸。例如，达克拉群岛随众神的意愿而移动，因此证明不可能绘制地图。",
	"As a result, Map 3.1 serves largely as a vaguely agreed upon arrangement of locations, fuzzy borders, and general distances. While the scale and placement of sites are true by mortal standards, details might change as the gods please. As such, journeying between places is most reliably conducted by employing guides or maps specific to a single destination.": "因此，地图3.1在很大程度上是对地点、模糊的边界和一般距离的模糊约定的安排。虽然按照凡人的标准，这些地点的规模和位置是真实的，但细节可能会随神灵的意愿而改变。因此，在不同的地方之间旅行，最可靠的方法是使用特定于一个目的地的指南或地图。",
	"If you are running a campaign in Theros, you can adjust distances between locations to suit the needs of your adventures. The distance might not be the same for two successive journeys; any trek across Theros can expand or contract to accommodate adventures and encounters as you wish.": "如果你在Theros开展活动，你可以调整地点之间的距离以适应你的冒险需要。两次连续的旅程的距离可能不一样；任何横跨特洛斯的跋涉都可以根据你的意愿扩展或收缩，以适应冒险和遭遇。",
	"Human civilization in Theros is centered in three poleis: Akros, Meletis, and Setessa. These poleis exemplify the human drive to settle the land, to shape nature according to their needs, and to organize into political structures that can withstand the changing fortunes of the passing centuries.": "泰罗斯的人类文明以三个波利斯为中心。Akros、Meletis和Setessa。这些极地体现了人类在土地上定居的动力，根据他们的需要塑造自然，并组织成能够抵御几个世纪以来不断变化的命运的政治结构。",
	"Each polis is centered in a city but includes a wide region of surrounding territory, and each one has its own distinct society and culture. To the people of Theros, \"Meletis\" is more or less synonymous with \"Meletians\"—the polis isn't just the people who live in the city of Meletis or even those who dwell in nearby villages; it is the people who follow the Meletian way of life, wherever they might be found.": "每个政区都以一个城市为中心，但也包括周围的广大地区，每个政区都有自己独特的社会和文化。对特洛斯人来说，\"Meletis \"或多或少是 \"Meletians \"的同义词--政体不仅仅是住在Meletis城的人，甚至是住在附近村庄的人；它是遵循Meletian生活方式的人，无论他们在哪里都可以找到。",
	"In every polis, civic responsibility and full protection are afforded only to citizens. Citizenship is limited to those whose parents were both citizens of the polis. Citizens of other poleis, and their children, aren't permitted to participate in the government of the polis. In Akros, citizens must meet one additional requirement: they must serve in the army.": "在每个政体中，公民责任和全面保护只提供给公民。公民身份只限于那些父母都是该政体公民的人。其他政区的公民和他们的子女不允许参与政区的管理。在阿克罗斯，公民必须满足一个额外的要求：他们必须在军队服役。",
	"The three poleis have different political structures, but each one has a council elected by popular vote of the citizenry. The Twelve, Meletis's council of philosophers, is the democratically elected ruling body of the polis. Akros is ruled by a hereditary monarch who is advised by a council of elders elected by and from among the citizenry. Similarly, Setessa's Ruling Council is formed by popular vote, and they govern the polis while its queen—the goddess Karametra—is absent.": "这三个城市有不同的政治结构，但每个城市都有一个由公民投票选出的议会。梅莱蒂斯的哲学家委员会 \"十二人 \"是政体的民主选举统治机构。阿克罗斯的统治者是一位世袭君主，他由公民中选出的长老会提供建议。同样，塞特萨的统治委员会也是由民众投票产生的，他们在女王--卡拉米特拉女神--不在的情况下管理政区。",
	"Trade between Akros and Meletis is constant and productive. Caravans make the two-day journey between the poleis at least once a week, carrying fine Akroan metalwork and pottery to Meletis, and Meletian fabric, stonework, and fish northward. Both poleis mint coins of copper, silver, and gold, with equivalent value.": "阿克罗斯和梅莱蒂斯之间的贸易是持续的、富有成效的。商队每周至少一次在两地之间进行为期两天的旅行，将精美的阿克罗斯金属制品和陶器运往梅莱蒂斯，将梅莱蒂斯的织物、石器和鱼类运往北方。两地都铸造铜、银和金的硬币，价值相当。",
	"Setessa trades with the other poleis as well, but less extensively. Its Abora Market, just inside the city gates, is open to outsiders only on certain days, and Setessan merchants prefer to barter goods rather than accept currency. Despite these restrictions, Setessan food, woodwork, and trained falcons are highly valued in the other poleis.": "塞特萨也与其他地区进行贸易，但范围较小。它的阿波拉市场就在城门内，只在特定的日子向外人开放，塞特萨的商人更愿意以物易物，而不是接受货币。尽管有这些限制，塞梯斯的食物、木制品和训练有素的猎鹰在其他地区受到高度重视。",
	"Aside from the other human poleis, Meletis and Setessa both trade with the centaurs of the Lagonna band. The centaurs don't work metal, so they trade woodwork, the produce of the plains, and woven blankets to the human poleis in exchange for weapons and armor.": "除了其他的人类Poleis，Meletis和Setessa都与Lagonna乐队的半人马进行交易。半人马不加工金属，所以他们用木制品、平原上的农产品和编织的毯子来换取人类波利斯人的武器和盔甲。",
	"The people of the poleis enjoy the opportunity for some recreation, as time and money allow.": "在时间和金钱允许的情况下，Poleis的人们享受一些娱乐的机会。",
	"Gymnasia are popular gathering places, offering athletic training as well as space for philosophical discussion and friendly socializing. A resident of the city might visit a gymnasium one day to exercise, the next to view a wrestling match between celebrated competitors, and the next to hear a renowned philosopher give a lecture on ethics.": "体育馆是受欢迎的聚会场所，既提供运动训练，也为哲学讨论和友好的社交提供空间。一个城市的居民可能今天去体育馆锻炼身体，明天去观看著名选手之间的摔跤比赛，而后又去听一位著名哲学家的伦理学讲座。",
	"The astronomers and philosophers of Meletis have established a calendar that has found some adoption in Akros and Setessa. It divides the year into twelve months of twenty-nine or thirty days, each beginning with the new moon. About every three years, an extra thirty-day month is added at the end of the calendar to keep it aligned with the solar year.": "梅莱蒂斯的天文学家和哲学家建立了一个日历，在阿克罗斯和塞特萨也找到了一些采用。它将一年分为十二个月，每月二十九天或三十天，从新月开始。大约每三年，在日历的末尾会多加一个三十天的月份，以保持它与太阳年的一致性。",
	"The beginning of the year is considered the end of winter, so the new year begins with the spring. Each month is holy to a specific god and named after a major festival celebrated in Meletis during that month. Setessa and Akros have adopted the same names even though they don't share all the same observances, with one exception: the fifth month (Thriambion in Meletis) is called Iroagonion in Akros, after the Iroan Games, which are held in that month every year.": "一年的开始被认为是冬天的结束，所以新的一年从春天开始。每个月都有一个特定的神，并以Meletis在该月庆祝的一个主要节日命名。塞特萨和阿克罗斯采用了相同的名字，尽管他们没有分享所有相同的纪念活动，但有一个例外：第五个月（Meletis的Thriambion）在阿克罗斯被称为Iroagonion，因为Iroan运动会每年都在这个月举行。",

	"The walled polis of Akros stands defiantly atop a precipitous cliff. The unforgiving mountains around it serve as a shield between its holdings and the rest of Theros. Few have ever dared to attack its famed fortress, the Kolophon, and no attack has ever breached its walls. To the residents of Theros, the Akroans hold near-mythical status: feared warriors produced by a culture that centers around perfecting the mind and body for war. Their armies have rarely tasted defeat as they expand the borders of Akros, seizing new lands and bounty.": "阿克罗斯（Akros）有围墙的政区轻蔑地矗立在悬崖峭壁之上。它周围无情的山脉是它的领地和特洛斯其他地区之间的盾牌。很少有人敢于攻击它著名的堡垒--科洛芬，也没有任何攻击能够攻破它的城墙。对于特洛斯的居民来说，阿克洛人拥有近乎神话般的地位：令人畏惧的战士是由一种以完善战争的身心为中心的文化产生的。他们的军队很少尝到失败的滋味，因为他们扩大了阿克罗斯的边界，夺取了新的土地和财物。",
	"For most of Akros's neighbors, the term \"Akroan\" evokes legendary warriors, trained from birth in every martial discipline known to humankind. It brings to mind songs of tight-knit martial bands, holding strong in the face of unbeatable odds. It sings of a great yearly competition that crowns the preeminent warrior-athlete in Akros, and—by extension—the world. The majority of Akros's inhabitants, though, aren't members of its martial elite. The famed warriors of Akros have the means to devote their lives to studying and training in the ways of war because they rest atop a rigid social structure of serfs and servants that largely dwell beyond the Kolophon's walls. Those who stand at the heights of Akroan society, or outside it, are detailed here.": "对于大多数Akros的邻居来说，\"Akroan \"这个词让人联想到传奇战士，从出生起就接受人类已知的各种武术训练。它让人想到了紧密结合的武术队的歌曲，在面对不可战胜的困难时，他们依然坚守。它唱出了一个伟大的年度竞赛，在阿克罗斯，乃至全世界，都有杰出的战士-运动员。然而，Akros的大多数居民并不是其武术精英的成员。阿克罗斯著名的战士有能力将他们的生命投入到战争方式的研究和训练中，因为他们处在一个由农奴和仆人组成的严格的社会结构之上，这些人主要居住在Kolophon的城墙之外。这里详细介绍了那些站在阿克罗斯社会高处的人，或在社会之外的人。",
	"Traditionally, Akros is ruled by a monarch drawn from the lineage of lektoi. The monarchy passes from parent to eldest child, but any sibling or first cousin of the heir can challenge this succession and claim the throne by besting the heir in single combat.": "传统上，阿克罗斯由来自莱克托伊家族的君主统治。王权由父母传给长子，但继承人的任何兄弟姐妹或嫡亲表亲都可以挑战这一继承权，并在单挑中击败继承人而获得王位。",
	"Currently, the monarchy is in a state of turmoil. King Anax has died, and his wife, Queen Cymede, has disappeared. An oracle of Keranos, the queen is said to have transformed into a pillar of fire and vanished into the wind, but until her death is certain, the lektoi are reluctant to name a new monarch. Anax and Cymede have no children, so the king's niece, Taranika, acts as regent, attempting to guide the polis through what is sure to be a difficult transition.": "目前，君主制正处于动荡状态。阿纳克斯国王已经去世，他的妻子西梅德女王也失踪了。作为Keranos的神谕，女王据说已经变成了一根火柱，消失在风中，但在她的死亡确定之前，Lektoi不愿意指定一个新的君主。Anax和Cymede没有孩子，所以国王的侄女Taranika作为摄政者，试图引导政体度过肯定是困难的过渡期。",
	"As if the situation weren't complicated enough, rumors have it that Anax isn't dead. He, or perhaps some shimmering Nyxborn simulacrum of him, has been seen at the head of squads of satyr hoplites, wielding an axe that billows with smoke and drips searing lava.": "仿佛情况还不够复杂，有传言说阿纳克斯并没有死。他，或许是某个闪闪发光的Nyxborn模拟人，已经被看到站在萨提尔跳骑兵的队首，挥舞着一把斧头，冒着烟，滴着灼热的熔岩。",
	"At the apex of Akroan society are the lektoi, the large warrior class of Akros. Members of this class claim descent from the seven warriors who first established the Kolophon after the fall of the archons. Though the families now number more than seven, each one uses an animal associated with one of the seven warriors as its symbol, either the ram, lion, horse, boar, badger, bull, or hart. The ram, associated with Akros's first king, Elektes, is commonly used as a symbol for the lektoi as a whole and for Akroan strength, determination, and resilience. It is a popular theme in clothing, jewelry, and weapon ornamentation, and some lektoi even wear their hair braided into stylized ram horns.": "处于阿克罗社会顶峰的是莱克托伊，阿克罗的大型战士阶层。这个阶级的成员声称自己是七位勇士的后裔，他们在大天使陨落后首次建立了科洛芬。虽然现在家族的人数超过了七人，但每个家族都使用与七位勇士之一相关的动物作为其象征，要么是公羊、狮子、马、野猪、獾、公牛或野猪。公羊与阿克罗斯的第一位国王埃利克泰斯有关，通常被用作整个莱克托伊的象征，也是阿克罗斯力量、决心和韧性的象征。它是服装、珠宝和武器装饰的一个流行主题，一些莱克托伊人甚至把头发编成有风格的公羊角。",
	"Although the lektoi claim descent from heroes, membership in this noble class isn't strictly hereditary. Anyone can earn a place among them by claiming a victory in the annual Iroan Games. More commonly, members of lektoi families lose their place of privilege if they fail to fulfill their obligation to serve in the Akroan military.": "虽然莱克托伊人声称自己是英雄的后裔，但这个贵族阶层的成员资格并不是严格意义上的世袭。任何人都可以通过在一年一度的伊洛安运动会上取得胜利而在他们中间获得一席之地。更常见的是，如果莱克托伊家族的成员没有履行在阿克罗安军队服役的义务，就会失去他们的特权地位。",
	"The Akroan military is formed of wandering bands of warriors (drawn from the lektoi families) known as stratians. Outside the walls of the Kolophon, the stratians camp in the forests and fields, hunt game for food, and train younger warriors as they go. Their tasks are to search for monsters that have strayed into Akroan territory and to protect travelers.": "阿克罗安的军队是由被称为stratians的流浪战士（来自lektoi家族）组成的。在科洛芬的城墙外，stratians在森林和田野里扎营，猎取食物，并在路上训练年轻的战士。他们的任务是搜寻误入阿克罗安领土的怪物并保护旅行者。",
	"Stratian forces are divided into three types of duty and armed appropriately for the task before them:": "斯特拉蒂亚部队被分为三种类型的职责，并为他们面前的任务提供适当的武装。",
	"Rugged forces of wanderers patrol Akros's borders, defending against invasion or attack by monsters that dwell in the mountains, foothills, and badlands around Akroan territory. They are armed and armored for speed and agility, allowing them to move stealthily and strike unexpectedly.": "崎岖的流浪者部队在阿克罗斯的边界巡逻，抵御居住在阿克罗斯领土周围的山脉、山麓和坏境中的怪物的入侵或攻击。他们的武器和装甲的速度和敏捷性，使他们能够隐蔽地移动，出其不意地攻击。",
	"The most elite forces among the stratians, the so-called wolves contend with threats that the Alamon can't handle alone. After the guerrilla tactics of the Alamon have softened up a target, the heavily armored Lukos march to finish the task.": "作为斯特拉提亚人中最精锐的部队，所谓的狼人要对付阿拉蒙人无法单独处理的威胁。在阿拉蒙的游击战术软化了一个目标之后，全副武装的卢科斯就开始进军，完成任务。",
	"The watchers are the guardians of the Kolophon who protect the fortress from invaders and maintain order within its walls.": "守望者是科洛芬的守护者，他们保护要塞不受入侵者的侵扰，并维持其墙内的秩序。",
	"Prominent spellcasters, the flamespeakers are reclusive priests of Purphoros who revere nature spirits and who inhabit fiery rifts in the mountains. The ancient practice is viewed as primitive but powerful, and Akroans of any background might risk making a pilgrimage into the mountains to hear a flamespeaker's prophecies.": "著名的施法者，是普尔福罗斯的隐居祭司，他们崇尚自然之灵，居住在山中的火热裂缝。这种古老的做法被认为是原始但强大的，任何背景的阿克洛人都可能冒着风险到山里朝圣，以听取火焰演讲者的预言。",
	"Lektoi who complete their military service with honor often retire to the Kolophon or their family estates and go about the leisured life of aristocrats. Their households are run by a class of servants made up of lektoi who were unable or unwilling to undertake a military career. These servants lack citizenship's full privileges but retain a position of some honor thanks to their class.": "光荣完成兵役的莱克托伊人通常会退役到科洛芬或他们的家族庄园，过着贵族般的安逸生活。他们的家庭由那些不能或不愿意从事军事事业的莱克托伊人组成的仆人阶层管理。这些仆人缺乏公民的全部特权，但由于他们的阶级而保留了一些荣誉的地位。",
	"Below these servants, at the bottom of Akros's social hierarchy, are the serfs. Comprising the vast majority of Akros's population, the serfs largely reside outside the protection of the Kolophon, laboring to grow the staple crops that support Akros's citizens and its trade. A relatively small number of serfs are skilled artisans who manage to build a more prosperous life for themselves with their crafts. But even these wealthier serfs can't own the land they live on, and they enjoy few rights or legal protections.": "在这些仆人之下，处于阿克罗斯社会等级制度的底层，是农奴。农奴占了阿克罗斯人口的绝大部分，他们主要居住在科洛芬的保护范围之外，从事种植主食作物的劳动，以支持阿克罗斯的公民和贸易。相对较少的农奴是熟练的工匠，他们设法用自己的手艺为自己建立一个更繁荣的生活。但即使是这些较富裕的农奴也不能拥有他们生活的土地，他们几乎不享有任何权利或法律保护。",
	"Akros maintains a standoffish—and often hostile—stance toward its neighbors, particularly the minotaurs of Phoberos, the leonin of Oreskos, and the centaurs of the Pheres band. Members of those peoples rarely find a warm welcome in Akroan territory. However, Akroans respect prowess, loyalty, and self-sacrifice, and might welcome any who embody such virtues. Some stratians also seek to learn the martial practices of other peoples, and might invite individuals or small communities to Akros to learn their ways.": "阿克罗斯对其邻国保持着对峙的态度，而且往往是敌对的态度，特别是菲比罗斯的牛头人、奥雷斯科的利安人和佩雷斯带的半人马。这些民族的成员在阿克罗安的领土上很少受到热烈欢迎。然而，阿克罗人尊重能力、忠诚和自我牺牲，并可能欢迎任何体现这些美德的人。一些斯特拉提亚人也寻求学习其他民族的武术，并可能邀请个人或小团体到阿克罗斯学习他们的方法。",
	"During the Iroan Games, everyone is welcome in the stadium. Satyrs flock to the city to witness the competition, and some take up permanent residence, celebrating the outcome of one year's games until it's time to start watching the next.": "在伊洛恩运动会期间，体育场内欢迎所有人。萨特人涌入城市见证比赛，有些人则长期居住，庆祝一年的比赛结果，直到开始观看下一年的比赛。",
	"At the center of the polis of Akros rises the Kolophon, a mighty fortress and the seat of Akroan power. This many-tiered structure perches upon a vast cliff, which drops into a deep canyon carved by the Deyda River. Nature and Akroan ingenuity conspire to make the Kolophon one of the most intimidating fortresses in Theros.": "在阿克罗斯政区的中心，耸立着科洛芬，一个强大的堡垒和阿克罗斯的权力所在地。这座多层建筑坐落在一个巨大的悬崖上，悬崖落入由Deyda河雕刻的深谷。大自然和阿克罗安人的聪明才智共同作用，使科洛芬成为特洛斯最令人生畏的堡垒之一。",
	"Beyond the polis stretch craggy hills and mountains broken by narrow stretches of arable plains. It is a nearly impassable landscape, save for a few roads hewn through passes. Residents claim that only a fool would attempt to invade the heartlands of Akros, yet Akroans obsessively guard against invasion nonetheless.": "政区之外，是被狭长的可耕地平原打破的峭壁山丘和山脉。这是一片几乎不可逾越的风景，除了几条凿通的道路。居民们声称，只有傻瓜才会试图入侵阿克罗斯的中心地带，但阿克罗斯人还是执着地防范着入侵。",
	"Beyond its thick walls, the streets of Akros are dotted with towering statues of heroes. Red-tiled roofs soar over square-topped sandstone columns, and holy sites dedicated to Iroas, Purphoros, and Keranos, among the other gods, are many. The architecture is formidable, spare, and militaristic, thick with sharp, angular shapes.": "在其厚实的城墙之外，阿克罗斯的街道上点缀着高耸的英雄雕像。红瓦屋顶在方顶砂岩柱上高高耸立，供奉伊鲁阿斯、普尔福罗斯和凯拉诺斯等神的圣地很多。建筑是可怕的、闲置的和军事化的，具有尖锐的、有棱角的形状。",
	"At the heart of the walled city is the huge stadium that hosts Theros's greatest sporting event, the Iroan Games. A grand temple of Iroas stands beside it, serving as the venue for award ceremonies. A wide plaza connects the stadium to the city's outer gates, offering plenty of room for celebration around the annual games.": "在这座有围墙的城市的中心，有一个巨大的体育场，它是Theros最伟大的体育赛事--Iroan运动会的举办地。一座宏伟的伊洛亚斯神庙矗立在旁边，作为颁奖仪式的场所。一个宽阔的广场连接着体育场和城市的外门，为每年的运动会提供了充足的庆祝空间。",
	"When the stadium isn't hosting the actual Iroan Games, it is still used daily for training and for lesser athletic events. Many of the buildings surrounding the stadium are dedicated to serving it: smaller training facilities, providers of athletic gear, stables, and other shops.": "当体育场没有举办真正的伊洛尼亚运动会时，它仍然每天用于训练和较小的体育赛事。体育场周围的许多建筑都是专门为其服务的：小型训练设施、运动装备供应商、马厩和其他商店。",
	"The uppermost tier of the city, perched on a rocky outcropping at the southwestern corner of the Kolophon, is the great citadel. The Oromai (the \"watchers\" who maintain order and defend the Kolophon) are quartered within the citadel's imposing walls, and the monarch's palace is built atop it. Temples of Iroas, Heliod, and Keranos also adorn the top of the citadel, the latter commissioned by the late Queen Cymede, built with an open roof to give her a clear view of stormy skies.": "城市的最上层，坐落在科洛芬西南角的岩石上，是大城堡。Oromai（维持秩序和保卫科洛芬的 \"守望者\"）被安置在城墙内，而君主的宫殿则建在城墙之上。Iroas、Heliod和Keranos的庙宇也装饰在城堡的顶部，后者是由已故的Cymede女王委托建造的，有一个开放的屋顶，使她可以清楚地看到暴风雨的天空。",
	"Arable land is scattered across small plateaus and valleys in Akros, meaning that the serf communities that farm the land are small and just as scattered. Volcanic rifts, landslides, and venomous animals make travel dangerous for anyone who doesn't know the terrain, and visitors wishing to avoid suspicion from patrolling stratians would be wise to stick to the roads.": "可耕地分散在阿克罗斯的小高原和山谷中，这意味着耕种土地的农奴社区很小，也很分散。火山裂缝、山体滑坡和有毒的动物使得不了解地形的人在旅行时很危险，希望避免被巡逻的斯特拉提人怀疑的游客最好坚持走大路。",
	"The Alamon soldiers spend most of their time patrolling Akros's outlying areas, centering their patrols around scattered outposts. These serve as staging grounds for Alamon and Lukos units to prepare as they venture out to raid or guard against monsters and invaders.": "阿拉蒙士兵大部分时间都在阿克罗斯的外围地区巡逻，以分散的哨所为中心进行巡逻。这些地方是阿拉蒙和卢克斯部队的集结地，为他们冒险突袭或防备怪物和入侵者做准备。",
	"The outpost in One-Eyed Pass serves to keep an Akroan eye on the large cyclops population of the area, but the stratians also use the cyclopes to their advantage. Any time dangerous creatures come down from the mountains and pose a potential threat to Akroan holdings, the Alamon harry the enemy and try to funnel them into the pass. The cyclopes of the pass viciously defend their territory against all intruders, weakening or even eliminating the danger before it can reach the Akroan outpost, where the Lukos finish off any stragglers.": "独眼山口的前哨站是为了监视该地区大量的独眼巨人，但斯特拉特人也利用独眼巨人为自己服务。只要有危险的生物从山上下来，对阿克罗安的财产构成潜在的威胁，阿拉蒙人就会骚扰敌人，并试图把他们引入山口。山口的独眼巨人凶狠地保卫着自己的领地，抵御所有的入侵者，在危险到达阿克罗安的前哨之前，削弱甚至消灭危险，在那里，Lukos会干掉任何落单者。",
	"On the western border of Akros gapes a massive chasm rumored to descend all the way to the underworld and belch forth foul creatures. The great stone bridge that spans it is the only way into Akros from this direction. Stratians consider it a high honor to be assigned to guard the bridge.": "在阿克罗斯的西部边界，有一条巨大的鸿沟，据传它一直延伸到冥界，并喷出恶臭的生物。横跨它的巨大石桥是从这个方向进入阿克罗斯的唯一途径。斯特拉特人认为被派去守卫这座桥是一种高度的荣誉。",
	"These stone \"stairs,\" seemingly carved into the granite cliffs that protect Akros and haunted at all times by eerie, whistling winds, provide natural access to Akros. The stratians guard it fiercely and use it as a staging ground for invading the lowlands.": "这些石头 \"阶梯\"，似乎是刻在保护阿克罗斯的花岗岩悬崖上，并随时被阴森恐怖的呼啸的风所困扰，提供了进入阿克罗斯的天然通道。斯塔提亚人对其进行了严密的保护，并将其作为入侵低地的中转站。",
	"Several semipermanent encampments dot the badlands between Akros and the wilds beyond. Fresh cadres of troops come here every month to relieve soldiers who are worn out by relentless assaults from raiders, fire-breathing dragons, and other threats.": "几个半永久性的营地点缀在阿克罗斯和荒野之间的荒地上。每个月都有新的部队骨干来到这里，接替那些被突袭者、喷火龙和其他威胁无情攻击而疲惫不堪的士兵。",
	"The Akroans believe that the gods are best worshiped at the places closest to Nyx—mountain peaks. Small temples and shrines are found throughout Akroan territory. Some are tucked in caves or nestled in crevices or canyons, while others are bare altars exposed to the elements.": "阿克罗人相信，在最接近尼克斯山峰的地方崇拜神灵是最好的。小型寺庙和神殿遍布阿克罗安地区。有些藏在山洞里，或依偎在裂缝或峡谷中，有些则是暴露在大自然中的光秃秃的祭坛。",
	"Myths of the Akroan War": "阿克罗安战争的神话",

Slighted and heartbroken, the Olantian king summoned his whole host of loyal spears and sails to wage war on the fortified mountain polis.": "在奥兰丁政体沉入海底的几个世纪前（一个在{@book chapter 4|MOT|4}中讲述的神话），它的女王为了阿克罗斯的国王离开了她的丈夫。奥兰丁的国王受到了轻视和心碎，他召集了他所有忠诚的长矛和风帆，向这个坚固的山地政体开战。",
	"What followed was a siege that stretched on for decades. Whole parts of Akros were destroyed and rebuilt in the fighting. There were heroes who knew only a life of conflict, performing feats of incredible prowess for the honor of Olantin, or who awed the gods with their sleepless commitment to defending the gates of Akros.": "随之而来的是一场持续了几十年的围攻。阿克罗斯的整个地区在战斗中被摧毁和重建。有一些英雄只知道冲突的生活，他们为了奥兰丁的荣誉做出了令人难以置信的壮举，或者用他们不眠不休的承诺来保卫阿克罗斯的大门，使诸神为之震惊。",
	"Most people today know of the event from an embellished account laid down in an epic poem, {@i The Akroan War}. Although its author has been lost to time, the poem is considered to be a definitive accounting of the greatest war in history.

Gathered in small bands of fierce raiders, the Pheres centaurs plunder whatever prey they can find: merchants and other travelers moving between Akros and Setessa, settlers trying to eke out an existence in the region, leonin tribes, Lagonna-band centaurs who range too far to the north, and any others they encounter.": "在阿克罗斯的山脉和东南面广阔的内森森林之间，Pheres-band半人马游荡在干燥的丘陵地带。Pheres半人马聚集在一小群凶猛的袭击者中，掠夺他们能找到的任何猎物：商人和其他在阿克罗斯和塞特萨之间移动的旅行者、试图在该地区勉强生存的定居者、Leonin部落、向北延伸太远的Lagonna半人马，以及他们遇到的任何其他人。",

	"The archon Agnomakhos ruled the area that is now Meletis for centuries. Impressing those he conquered into his legions, Agnomakhos aggressively expanded his empire, spreading it as far as the forests to the east and the mountains to the north. Ultimately, though, the heroes Kynaios and Tiro overthrew the archon. From the empire's ruins rose Meletis, a land that endeavors to reject cruelty and oppression throughout the world, and guards against hypocrisy within its own borders.": "大主教阿格诺玛科斯统治现在的梅莱蒂斯地区长达几个世纪。阿格诺玛科斯把他征服的人打造成他的军团，积极地扩大他的帝国，把它扩展到东部的森林和北部的山脉。但最终，英雄Kynaios和Tiro推翻了这位大君。从帝国的废墟中崛起的Meletis，一个努力拒绝全世界的残酷和压迫，并在自己的边界内防止虚伪的土地。",
	"For a time, Kynaios and Tiro ruled Meletis, striving to govern in accordance with the highest philosophical and ethical principles, which ultimately led them to relinquish their power and establish a philosopher-led republic.

	"The people of Meletis take pride in their city's grand architecture, especially the great temples to the gods.

	"Rich fields and the bounty of the sea support most people throughout Meletis. The people have reputations for being accomplished weavers, skilled sailors, and cunning merchants. Books and literacy are also common throughout the land, and the work of scribes, cartographers, musicians, and storytellers is well regarded.

Many Meletian mages are trained at the elite academy of the Dekatia, but countless smaller schools and private tutors teach the magical arts.

	"The mark of a true thaumaturge, though, is a gift or positive omen from the gods; even the most accomplished student of magic can't earn the title without such a sign of divine approval. One mage might receive the gift of a spear from Heliod, another could receive a clockwork owl from Ephara, and still another might experience a wild, creative vision from Keranos.": "不过，真正的Thaumaturge的标志是来自诸神的礼物或积极的预兆；即使是最有成就的魔法学生，如果没有这种神明的认可，也无法获得这个称号。一个法师可能会收到赫利奥德的长矛礼物，另一个法师可能会收到埃法拉的发条猫头鹰，还有一个法师可能会经历凯拉诺斯的疯狂、创造性的愿景。",

	"Of all the poleis, Meletis has the closest relationship with the tritons of the Siren Sea. Several communities of tritons consider the harbors of Meletis and secluded coastal sanctuaries their home. Many take part in work near and under the water that other peoples are ill-suited to, but increasingly tritons find work not related to the sea, with triton restaurants, chemists, and members of the Reverent Army being increasingly common.": "在所有的Poleis中，Meletis与塞壬海的三文鱼有着最密切的关系。一些三文鱼社区把梅里提斯的港口和隐蔽的海岸避难所当作自己的家。许多人参加其他民族不适合的水边和水下的工作，但越来越多的tritons找到了与海洋无关的工作，tritons餐馆、化学家和尊敬的军队成员越来越常见。",
	"Meletis maintains a fragile peace with centaurs of the Lagonna band, engaging in regular trade. It's not uncommon for small groups of centaurs to set up shop in the polis market for short periods, though few spend more than a night or two in the city, most finding it claustrophobic at best.": "梅莱蒂斯与拉贡带的半人马保持着脆弱的和平，进行着定期贸易。一小群半人马在波利斯市场上短期开店的情况并不少见，不过很少有人会在城市里呆上一两个晚上，大多数人觉得这里充其量不过是个幽静的地方。",
	"Few leonin journey to Meletis, knowing little of the land beyond what their stories remember of Agnomakhos's tyranny. Even an age after the archon's rule, most leonin view Meletis as a cursed place.

	"The architectural and academic marvels of Meletis testify to the achievements of civilized humanity. The streets are paved with bricks made in interlocking geometric shapes, meant to demonstrate principles of both mathematics and magic. Grand temples line the streets, testifying to the Meletians' devotion to the gods. These rise as both mighty bastions dedicated to individual deities and various neighborhood shrines devoted to the pantheon as a whole.": "梅莱蒂斯的建筑和学术奇迹证明了文明人类的成就。街道上的砖块被铺成交错的几何形状，旨在展示数学和魔法的原理。街道两旁的大寺庙，证明了Meletians对神明的虔诚。这些庙宇既是献给个别神灵的强大堡垒，也是献给整个万神殿的各种邻里祠堂。",
	"Inside the city, the wild lands feel like a remote threat. Perils from the sea present more obvious dangers, but a great sea wall protects the polis's port on the Bay of Meletis, while a lengthy channel cuts through the surrounding land to reach Meletis Harbor on the Siren Sea.": "在城市里，荒凉的土地让人觉得是一种遥远的威胁。来自海上的危险更明显，但一道巨大的海墙保护着波利斯在迈勒蒂斯湾的港口，而一条长长的通道穿过周围的土地，到达塞壬海的迈勒蒂斯港。",
	"Many Meletians speak of the \"edifice of knowledge,\" referring in the abstract to the sum of all learning and scholarship. Every citizen is expected to help improving this edifice for the good of the polis, whether through philosophical exploration, advancements in magical technique, investigation into the nature of the gods, or perfection of techniques in crafting and trade.": "许多Meletians谈论 \"知识的大厦\"，抽象地指的是所有学习和学术的总和。每个公民都被期望为政体的利益帮助改善这座大厦，无论是通过哲学探索、魔法技术的进步、对神灵本质的调查，还是工艺和贸易技术的完善。",
	"But the edifice of knowledge in Meletis is a literal structure as well as a metaphorical one: the Pyrgnos is a glowing stone tower standing near the coast. It is literally formed from the collected learnings of the polis, recorded on carved stone tablets and glowing letters hovering in the air. At night, the Pyrgnos shines like a lighthouse where the sea wall meets the shore, gleaming on the waters of the Siren Sea.": "但梅莱蒂斯的知识大厦是一个字面的结构，也是一个隐喻的结构：皮尔格诺斯是一座矗立在海岸边的发光石塔。它实际上是由收集到的政体的知识形成的，记录在雕刻的石板和盘旋在空中的发光字母上。到了晚上，皮尔格诺斯像灯塔一样闪耀在海墙与海岸的交接处，在塞壬海的水面上熠熠生辉。",
	"A decade ago, the Pyrgnos was partly demolished by a kraken that attacked the city, but it has been repaired and continues to grow, reflecting the continued learning of the polis's citizens.": "十年前，Pyrgnos被袭击城市的克拉肯部分拆毁，但它已被修复并继续增长，反映了波利斯市民的持续学习。",
	"Meletis boasts many centers of learning, but the preeminent academy for philosophers and mages is the Dekatia. Students who display remarkable promise over the course of their earlier education can go on to spend up to ten years in arduous training at the Dekatia, apprenticed to master priests, thaumaturges, philosophers, and military heroes. Those who manage to complete this decade of training are renowned as the wisest of the wise and the bravest of the brave, combining all the essential learning of the polis into one heroic package.": "梅里提斯拥有许多学习中心，但最杰出的哲学家和法师学院是德卡提亚。在早期教育过程中表现出色的学生可以在德卡提亚接受长达10年的艰苦训练，向祭司大师、泰玛特尔、哲学家和军事英雄学习。那些设法完成这十年训练的人被誉为最聪明的人和最勇敢的人，他们把政体的所有基本学问都融入了一个英雄的包裹。",
	"The Observatory is a tall viewing platform and a windowed structure offering a splendid view of the sky, renowned as a place to study Nyx, the home of the gods. Special crystals shaped by thaumaturges and blessed by the oracles of the gods enhance the view, making it easier for observers to see the workings of the gods among the stars and constellations. Priests, mages, and philosophers interpret what they see in the Observatory as signs and omens from the gods.": "天文台是一个高大的观景平台和一个有窗户的结构，提供了绚丽的天空景色，作为研究众神之家尼克斯的地方而闻名。由Thaumaturges塑造的特殊水晶和由众神的神谕祝福的水晶增强了视野，使观察者更容易看到众神在星星和星座中的运作。牧师、法师和哲学家将他们在天文台看到的东西解释为来自神灵的迹象和预兆。",
	"Myth of the Fall of Agnomakhos": "阿诺玛科斯的堕落神话",
	"From the back of his flying bull, the archon Agnomakhos led armies across the face of Theros, carving out an empire that stood for generations.

So, when the heroes Kynaios and Tiro sought to inspire an uprising, few flocked to their banner.": "在他的飞牛背上，大公Agnomakhos带领军队横跨特洛斯，建立了一个世代相传的帝国。虽然有无数的叛乱试图摆脱大主教的统治，但每一次都被他的巨人、利昂人和其他可怕的生物组成的军队击溃。因此，当英雄Kynaios和Tiro试图激发一场起义时，很少有人涌向他们的旗帜。",

She offered to aid Kynaios and Tiro in their battle against the tyrant, supplementing their martial skill with a new weapon: magic.": "叛军毫不畏惧，在不可能的情况下继续战斗。看到他们对自由事业的奉献，女神Ephara来到英雄们身边。她提出要帮助凯奈奥斯和蒂罗与暴君作战，用一种新的武器来补充他们的武术技能：魔法。",

	"Meletis sits on the coast of the Siren Sea, surrounded by rivers, sparse woodlands, and vast, stepped grasslands. Fields of barley provide sustenance to Meletians and their animals. Well-trod roads wind their way through the region, but most locals travel along the coast in simple boats.": "梅莱蒂斯坐落在塞壬海的海岸上，周围有河流、稀疏的林地和广阔的阶梯式草原。大麦田为梅莱蒂斯人和他们的动物提供了养料。完善的道路蜿蜒穿过该地区，但大多数当地人乘坐简单的船只沿着海岸旅行。",
	"The polis of Meletis embodies the heart and mind of what it means to be Meletian, but the polis's lands also includes numerous other settlements and wildernesses.

	"This small walled city is famous for Ephara's intervention to protect it from a kraken, her face coming to life on the marble wall and making the barrier grow so tall that the kraken couldn't get through. Altrisos now has Ephara's face on nearly every building and wall in the entire city in gratitude.": "这座有围墙的小城因埃法拉的干预而闻名，她的脸在大理石墙上栩栩如生，使屏障长得很高，以至于克拉肯无法通过。现在，阿尔特里索斯几乎在整个城市的每一座建筑和墙壁上都有艾法拉的脸，以示感谢。",

	"Though they are regarded as Meletians, the people of Neolantin view themselves as citizens of Olantin—a coastal polis that long ago vanished into the sea. According to legend, an angry Heliod smote the polis with his spear, sinking it in punishment for its people's utter hubris. The fact that the Neolantians were spared this fate, they say, is evidence of their humility, and they take special care in their sacrifices to Heliod.": "虽然他们被认为是Meletians，但Neolantin的人们认为自己是Olantin的公民--一个很久以前就消失在海里的沿海政体。根据传说，愤怒的赫利奥德用他的长矛击打了这个政体，使其沉没，以惩罚其人民的极端狂妄。他们说，新奥尔良人幸免于难的事实证明了他们的谦逊，而且他们在向赫利奥德献祭时特别小心。",

	"At the northern edge of Meletian territory, between the sea and the Nessian Wood, roam the centaurs of the Lagonna band. Unlike the ferocious Pheres band, the Lagonna-band centaurs are generally peaceful and don't engage in raids upon Meletian territory.

	"Setessa is also unique among the poleis of Theros in that few of its adult residents are men. Women comprise the bulk of the population, holding almost all of the leadership roles and carrying out most work. Men are few and far between, mostly performing roles at the polis's edge.

	"The populace of Setessa live in a beautiful paradise, and they're prepared to fight to the death to protect it. The constant training in archery, falconry, riding, and close combat can seem out of place among the idyllic forests and beautiful gardens and orchards, but that is the way of life in Setessa.": "塞特萨的民众生活在一个美丽的天堂，他们准备为保护这个天堂而战斗到死。在田园诗般的森林和美丽的花园和果园中，不断进行射箭、猎鹰、骑马和近身搏斗的训练似乎与之格格不入，但这就是塞特萨的生活方式。",

Some people move fluidly between roles, and a few choose a special role that Setessans view as standing outside the dichotomy of gender, living in Ophis Tower.": "尽管男人和女人扮演着非常不同的角色，但当涉及到任何个人在该结构中的位置时，塞特桑人是灵活的。一些男人在花了若干年的时间被认定为女性之后，开始了漫游，而一些女人在实现了漫游之后，又从漫游中返回（或从未进行漫游）。有些人在不同的角色之间流动，少数人选择了一个特殊的角色，塞特森人认为这是站在性别的二分法之外，住在奥菲斯塔。",
	"The warriors of Ophis Tower are martially trained as women are but wander the world as men do.

	"Karametra is the queen of Setessa, but of course gods have more important concerns than the day-to-day governance of a human polis. So a five-member council attends to the daily tasks of leadership on the deity's behalf. The council is made up of the commanders of the four prominent fortress-watchtowers that guard the polis. These commanders are elected by popular vote: Anthousa of Leina Tower, Phaedra of Hyrax Tower, Niketa of Bassara Tower, and Kallias of Ophis Tower. The fifth member is Silverbrow, a centaur oracle who reads the Kelema Veil at the Nexuses of the Seasons and advises action based on her visions. Anthousa is the head of the council, considered Karametra's closest advisor and the de facto ruler of the city.": "卡拉米特拉是塞特萨的女王，但当然，神有比人类政体的日常管理更重要的关切。因此，一个由五人组成的委员会代表神灵处理日常的领导工作。委员会由守卫政区的四个重要堡垒--瞭望塔的指挥官组成。这些指挥官是由民众投票选出的。Leina塔的Anthousa，Hyrax塔的Phaedra，Bassara塔的Niketa，以及Ophis塔的Kallias。第五位成员是Silverbrow，他是半人马神谕者，在四季的Nexuses阅读Kelema面纱，并根据她的预想提出行动建议。安托萨是议会的首脑，被认为是卡拉米特拉最亲密的顾问和城市的实际统治者。",
	"Karametra includes defense of the home in her domains, and the residents of Setessa follow suit. Setessan military forces are organized into four major regiments, each associated with a fortress tower.": "卡拉米特拉将保卫家园纳入她的领域，塞特萨的居民也效仿。塞特萨的军事力量分为四大团，每个团都与一个堡垒塔相关。",
	"The tower of the fox stands near the Summer Nexus and watches for interlopers who enter the Nessian Wood without permission. During their training, troops there focus on archery and guerrilla tactics. Their leader is Niketa, a woman in her fifties who spends most of her time in the tower since she parted ways with her dryad partner.": "狐狸之塔矗立在夏季纽带附近，监视那些未经许可进入内森森林的干扰者。在训练期间，那里的部队专注于箭术和游击战术。他们的领袖是尼基塔，一个五十多岁的女人，自从她与她的干尸伙伴分道扬镳后，她大部分时间都呆在塔里。",
	"The tower of the falcon lies on the ridge near the Autumn Nexus. Its regiment includes contingents of scouts and falconers. Its leader is Phaedra, a nineteen-year-old master falconer and orphan from Meletis who was rescued by the Ophis regiment.": "猎鹰之塔位于秋日奈克瑟斯附近的山脊上。它的军团包括侦察兵和猎鹰手的特遣队。它的领袖是费德拉，一个19岁的猎鹰大师和来自梅里提斯的孤儿，他被奥菲斯军团所救。",
	"The tower of the lion stands near Karametra's temple at the heart of Setessa. Its regiment, led by the hero Anthousa, is dedicated to the defense of the polis and the training of its children. The Leina warriors favor double-edged axes.": "狮子塔矗立在塞特莎中心的卡拉米特拉神庙附近。它的军团由英雄Anthousa领导，致力于保卫政体和训练其子女。莱纳战士们喜欢用双刃斧。",
	"The tower of the serpent nestles at the center of Setessa. Its wandering warriors travel the world, working on behalf of the Ruling Council. Their leader is Kallias, who was sold into slavery as a child. They lost an eye and several fingers before they were rescued and brought to Setessa, where they have devoted themselves to saving others in a similar plight.": "蛇之塔依偎在塞特萨的中心。它的游荡的战士们走遍世界，代表统治委员会工作。他们的领袖是卡利亚斯，他从小就被卖为奴隶。在获救并被带到塞特萨之前，他们失去了一只眼睛和几根手指，在那里他们致力于拯救处于类似困境的其他人。",
	"Children in Setessa are reared by the polis as a whole and treated with the highest respect; their welfare is paramount and their training is a significant part of every warrior's occupation. Orphans and abandoned children are sacred to Karametra, so they are brought into the city and tended just as Setessa's own children are.": "在塞特萨，儿童由整个政体抚养，受到最高的尊重；他们的福利是最重要的，他们的训练是每个战士职业的重要组成部分。孤儿和被遗弃的孩子对卡拉米特拉来说是神圣的，所以他们被带进城市，就像塞特萨自己的孩子一样被照顾着。",
	"Setessa doesn't welcome outsiders, as a rule, except the orphaned and abandoned children brought to live in the polis. But the polis can be more hospitable to nonhuman outsiders than to humans (especially male humans) from other poleis. A few centaurs of the Lagonna band, leonin, and satyrs have earned the right to live in Setessa. Dryads and naiads from the Nessian Wood rarely try to enter the polis, but they are often friendly with the Bassara soldiers who patrol the forest.": "通常情况下，塞特萨不欢迎外来者，除了那些被带入社区生活的孤儿和被遗弃的孩子。但是，与来自其他极地的人类（尤其是男性人类）相比，该极地对非人类的外来者可能更加热情好客。少数拉贡纳族的半人马、列宁和萨提尔已经赢得了在塞特萨生活的权利。来自内森森林的Dryads和naiads很少试图进入波利斯，但他们经常与在森林中巡逻的巴萨拉士兵友好相处。",
	"Setessa fuses nature and civilization into a single living organism. The polis extends from a huge tree at its center, like the rings of a still larger tree. A dense circle of vegetation forms the city's outer wall, with the treetops magically woven together to create a barrier against intruders. Expertly trained archers stand guard on platforms nestled among the upper branches. Inside these natural walls, patches of thick forest alternate with open spaces where the Setessans build their homes and civic buildings amid the trees. Out of deference to Nylea, the residents of Setessa never construct a building that isn't absolutely necessary, and their homes and buildings are seamlessly integrated into the environment, with magic coaxing vegetation to weave together into walls or roofs.": "塞特萨将自然和文明融合为一个单一的生物体。政区从中心的一棵大树上延伸出来，就像一棵更大的树的树环。一圈茂密的植被构成了城市的外墙，树梢神奇地交织在一起，形成了一道防止入侵者的屏障。训练有素的弓箭手站在平台上，依偎在上面的树枝之间。在这些天然的城墙内，成片的茂密森林与开放空间交替出现，塞特森人在树丛中建造他们的家园和市政建筑。出于对Nylea的尊重，塞特萨的居民从不建造非绝对必要的建筑，他们的住宅和建筑与环境完美地结合在一起，用魔法哄骗植被编织成墙壁或屋顶。",
	"In the very center of the city is the temple to Karametra, patron of Setessa. Three ancient trees grow from an earthen rise and spiral around the heart of the city. The temple, built of glittering limestone, nestles amid the massive trunks. Strong magical wards protect the temple, since Karametra herself sits here when she visits her beloved polis. All manner of civic functions are based in the temple, and most of them are carried out by Karametra's attendants. These attendants serve as healers, advisors, teachers, chroniclers, and oracles.": "在城市的最中心，有一座卡拉米特拉的寺庙，是塞特萨的守护神。三棵古树从一个土台子上长出来，围绕着城市的中心盘旋。寺庙由闪闪发光的石灰石建成，依偎在巨大的树干中。强大的魔法护卫保护着神庙，因为卡拉米特拉访问她心爱的城市时，她本人就坐在这里。所有的公民职能都在寺庙里，其中大部分是由卡拉米特拉的侍者执行的。这些侍者充当治疗师、顾问、教师、编年史和神谕。",
	"Four holy sites, corresponding to the four seasons, stand in or near the polis and serve as temples—primarily for the rites of Karametra and Nylea, but also to the other gods to an extent. These nexus points between the mortal world and Nyx—a phenomenon called the Kelema Veil—are where omens manifest amid star fields that glitter in the shadows and where oracles seek messages from the divine. The four nexuses are each distinct in their own ways.": "与四季相对应的四个圣地矗立在政区内或附近，作为寺庙--主要用于卡拉米特拉和奈拉的仪式，但在一定程度上也用于其他神灵。这些连接凡人世界和尼克斯的节点--一种被称为凯莱玛面纱的现象--是预兆在阴影中闪烁的星域中显现的地方，也是神谕者寻求神性信息的地方。这四个交汇点各具特色。",
	"Associated with Karametra, the Spring Nexus is located in a lavish garden just behind her temple in the city of Setessa. A large arch of vines and flowers leads into the nexus itself and stays fresh and green all year long. Spring is the most celebratory time for Setessans—a time for planting and hope. Worshipers leave gifts for both Karametra and Nylea here.": "与卡拉米特拉有关的 \"春之纽带 \"位于塞特萨市她的神庙后面的一个豪华花园里。一个由藤蔓和花朵组成的大拱门通向纽带本身，一年四季都保持着新鲜和绿色。春天是塞特萨人最值得庆祝的时刻--一个种植和希望的时刻。崇拜者在这里为卡拉米特拉和奈拉留下礼物。",
	"Located in an olive grove west of the city proper, the Summer Nexus is covered by a leafy green canopy. As a shelter from summer's heat, the nexus is a favorite resting spot for people and animals alike, and Nylea and Iroas are worshiped here.": "夏季纽带位于城市西部的一片橄榄树林中，被绿叶覆盖。作为一个避暑的场所，该中心是人们和动物最喜欢的休息场所，奈拉和伊洛亚斯在这里受到崇拜。",
	"Near the southern edge of Setessa, in an orchard filled with golden apples, a small cave behind a basalt arch holds a perpetually burning flame. Priests keep a strict rotation to ensure the fire never goes out, as it represents Purphoros's fire that keeps the world warm through the colder seasons and allows the autumn harvest. In addition to Purphoros, Setessans come here to worship Iroas and Mogis, when necessary.": "靠近塞特萨的南部边缘，在一个种满金苹果的果园里，一个玄武岩拱门后面的小山洞里有一团永远燃烧的火焰。祭司们严格轮流值班，以确保火焰永不熄灭，因为它代表着珀弗罗斯的火焰，使世界在寒冷的季节里保持温暖，并使秋天的收获成为可能。除了Purphoros，塞特桑人在必要时也会来这里祭拜Iroas和Mogis。",
	"At the eastern edge of Setessa hides a rocky cave that was once a lion's den. The cave contains a burial ground and is rumored to lead all the way into the underworld. Setessan children occasionally dare each other to see who can make it the farthest into the cave, but the morbid atmosphere usually sends the children scurrying back before long. Setessans come here to worship Pharika and Erebos, paying respects to the dead or hoping to fend off death for a while yet.": "在塞特萨的东部边缘，隐藏着一个岩石洞，它曾经是一个狮子的洞穴。洞穴里有一个墓地，据传可以一直通往冥界。塞特萨的孩子们偶尔会互相挑战，看谁能最远地进入洞穴，但这种病态的气氛通常会让孩子们在不久之后就跑回来。塞特桑人来到这里崇拜法里卡和埃里伯斯，向死者表示敬意，或希望能暂时抵御死亡。",
	"The Abora Market is a giant, open-air market just inside the main eastern gate of Setessa. Every day it is thronged with citizens buying and selling food, crafts, and curiosities. On the seven days surrounding the full moon, outsiders are even allowed into the market, though they are still prohibited from roaming the rest of the polis. Visitors who try to explore beyond the market are typically banned from the polis and must forfeit any goods they brought into the city.": "阿波拉市场是一个巨大的露天市场，就在塞特萨的正东门内。每天，这里都挤满了买卖食品、工艺品和奇珍异宝的市民。在月圆之夜的七天里，外人甚至被允许进入市场，尽管他们仍然被禁止在市镇的其他地方游荡。试图在市场以外探索的游客通常会被禁止进入政区，并且必须没收他们带入城市的任何货物。",
	"The most impressive part of the market is the raptor hall, where falconers show off the trained raptors available for sale. Hunters all over Theros come to buy famous Setessan falcons.": "市场中最令人印象深刻的部分是猛禽大厅，猎鹰人在那里展示训练有素的猛禽以供出售。泰罗斯各地的猎人都来购买著名的塞特桑猎鹰。",
	"Beyond the city's encircling trees, the territory of Setessa extends to cover about a third of the Nessian Wood and a wide swath of the open chaparral. In contrast to Meletis and Akros, no villages or military outposts mark Setessan territory, but a few key features in the Nessian Wood define the area under Setessan control.": "在城市周围的树木之外，塞特萨的领土延伸到了约三分之一的内森森林和大片开阔的灌木丛。与Meletis和Akros相比，塞特萨的领土上没有村庄或军事前哨，但内森森林的几个关键特征界定了塞特萨的控制区域。",
	"The Amatrophon encompasses a large forested region at the northwestern edge of Setessan territory, and it provides a safe haven and training ground for the diverse range of animals that occupy an honored place as natural protectors in Setessan society. Experts train the renowned falcons of Setessa here, along with horses for riding and for combat. More unusual animals are found here as well: trainers work with pegasi, wolves, and lions to get them ready to accompany Setessans in battle. Here men live and work alongside women, collectively training and caring for the animals that live here.": "Amatrophon包括塞特萨领土西北边缘的大片森林地区，它为各种动物提供了一个安全的避难所和训练场，这些动物在塞特萨社会中作为天然的保护者占据了光荣的地位。专家们在这里训练著名的塞特萨猎鹰，以及骑马和战斗用的马匹。这里也有更多不寻常的动物：训练师们与飞马、狼和狮子一起工作，让它们准备好在战斗中陪伴塞特萨人。在这里，男人与女人一起生活和工作，共同训练和照顾生活在这里的动物。",
	"The vast wilderness of the Nessian Wood is considered Nylea's domain. Its trees are as old as the world, twining together to form an impenetrable canopy shielding the wood from Heliod's angry glare. Their roots stretch deep into the earth, and some say they drink from the Rivers That Ring the World, the waters of the Underworld. All manner of wild and magical creatures dwell in the Nessian Wood, far from the reach of human civilization.": "内森森林的广阔荒野被认为是奈拉的领域。它的树木和世界一样古老，缠绕在一起，形成一个不可逾越的树冠，为森林遮挡住赫利奥德愤怒的光芒。它们的根系延伸到大地深处，有人说它们喝的是环抱世界的河流，是冥界的水。各种各样的野生和神奇的生物都居住在内森森林里，远离人类文明的影响。",
	"Nylea allows limited hunting in the Nessian Wood, but she has been known to kill those who poach without her permission. Setessa's Bassara regiment helps the god keep an eye out for such illicit hunters, as well as any intruders who might bring danger upon the polis.": "奈拉允许在奈森森林中进行有限的狩猎，但她也知道要杀死那些未经她允许而偷猎的人。塞特莎的巴萨拉军团帮助神留意这些非法的猎人，以及任何可能给政区带来危险的入侵者。",
	"A natural gap between two mountains on the west side of the Sperche River provides access into the Nessian Wood from the east. Ancient Setessans carved an impenetrable fortress into the mountains to guard the pass. Bassara patrols from Setessa still check in on the fortress regularly, and they occupy the fortress when there is reason to suspect danger from the east. More than once, though, patrols have reached the fort only to find something else has taken up residence, whether it be rowdy satyrs, grim Returned, or worse.": "斯佩尔什河西侧两座山之间的一个天然缺口为从东边进入内森森林提供了通道。古代的塞特萨人在山中开凿了一座坚不可摧的堡垒，以守卫这个通道。来自塞特萨的巴萨拉巡逻队仍然定期检查要塞，当有理由怀疑来自东部的危险时，他们就会占领要塞。不过，不止一次，巡逻队到达要塞时发现有别的东西住了进来，不管是吵闹的萨提亚，还是阴森的回归者，或者更糟。",
	"Setessa once extended its claim over more of the Nessian Wood, establishing military outposts like those of Akros. At the western end of the forest, along the road from Meletis known as the Guardian Way, the ruins of a round tower lie beside a rushing stream. This marks the greatest extent of ancient Setessa's reach. A site of rich natural beauty, with lilacs growing along the riverbank and silver fish darting in startlingly clear water, it is abandoned by Setessa and favored by travelers as a resting point on the road before coming under the eaves of the forest.": "塞特萨曾经把它的主张扩展到了内森森林的更多地方，建立了像阿克罗斯那样的军事哨所。在森林的西端，沿着被称为 \"守护者之路 \"的梅莱蒂斯的道路，一座圆塔的废墟坐落在一条奔腾的小溪旁。这标志着古代塞特莎的最大范围。这里有丰富的自然景观，河岸边生长着丁香花，银色的鱼儿在清澈的水中飞舞，这里被塞特萨遗弃，被旅行者们作为来到森林屋檐下之前的一个休息点而喜爱。",
	"Myth of Nikaia the First Caryatid": "第一任卡里蒂德人尼卡亚的神话",
	"A Setessan archer named Nikaia claimed that she could outshoot anyone, even Nylea. Word of this unwise boast spread, and in response Nylea appeared at the next archery contest at the Spring Nexus. She challenged Nikaia to an impossible feat of archery: to shoot an arrow into one of the twin trunks of Kruphix's great tree at the edge of the world. Nikaia immediately realized that neither refusal, failure, nor success would forestall Nylea's wrath. Nonetheless, she held her head high, she and Nylea both let fly, and both arrows hit. Impressed by the mortal, Nylea took Nikaia to her sacred grove and planted her there as a caryatid, immobile but forever occupying a place of honor.": "一个名叫尼卡亚的塞特桑弓箭手声称她能射中任何人，甚至是奈拉。这个不明智的吹嘘传开了，作为回应，奈拉出现在春季联接会的下一次射箭比赛中。她向Nikaia挑战一项不可能的射箭壮举：将箭射入Kruphix在世界边缘的大树的双干之一。尼凯亚立即意识到，无论是拒绝、失败还是成功，都无法阻止奈拉的愤怒。尽管如此，她还是昂首挺胸，她和奈拉同时放箭，两支箭都射中了。这个凡人给Nylea留下了深刻的印象，Nylea把Nikaia带到了她的圣林，并把她作为一个石像种植在那里，虽然不能移动，但永远占据着一个荣誉的位置。",
	"Since then, Nylea has honored dozens of other champions and worthy mortals, blessing them with the long lives of mighty trees. The grown seedlings of Nikaia and Nylea's other favored continue to share their wisdom and protect Setessa to this day.": "从那时起，Nylea已经表彰了几十个其他的冠军和有价值的凡人，祝福他们拥有强大的树木的长寿。尼卡亚和奈拉的其他宠儿长大的幼苗至今仍在分享他们的智慧，保护塞特莎。",
	"Our world stands on three feet: pride, dignity, and independence. When voices claim we've lost these virtues, do not listen. Those are the words of thieves, convincing you you've already lost what they aim to steal.": "我们的世界有三只脚：骄傲、尊严和独立。当有声音声称我们已经失去这些美德时，不要听。那是盗贼的话，让你相信你已经失去了他们想偷的东西。",
	"—Liala, matron of the Sun Guides": "-丽亚拉，太阳导览员的女主人",
	"A vast valley of dry grasslands nestled between the Katachthon and Oraniad Mountains, Oreskos is the home of the leonin. Here roam vast herds of knot-horned gazelle, flocks of elephant birds, prides of lean lions, and a menagerie of other beasts. Predatory griffins and manticores regularly range over the region's grassy seas, while beings like the anvilwroughts of Mount Velus or the Nyxborn from Nykthos often experience Oreskos as their first glimpse of the wider world.": "奥雷斯科斯是一个巨大的干草原山谷，坐落在卡塔赫通山和奥拉尼亚德山之间，是莱恩人的家园。这里游荡着成群的结角羚羊、成群的象鸟、成群的瘦狮和其他各种野兽。掠夺性的狮鹫和尾兽经常在该地区的草海中游荡，而像维鲁斯山的砧槽或来自奈克瑟斯的Nyxborn这样的生物，经常把奥雷斯科斯作为他们对更广阔世界的第一瞥。",
	"Close-knit prides of several dozen to a few hundred leonin make their homes throughout Oreskos. These communities treat every member as family, with all taking equal roles in hunting, cooking, family care, and other daily responsibilities. Status in the tribe typically comes with age and by forming relationships with other members of the community, whether through childrearing, friendships, romances, teaching, or otherwise. Leonin women tend to remain part of their mothers' prides, while males often leave to join new prides when they find partners. Councils of matriarchs make decisions for most prides, these leaders rising from among the oldest or best-respected women of the pride.": "由几十个到几百个利安人组成的紧密的王族在整个奥雷斯科人的家里。这些社区把每个成员都当作家人，所有人都在狩猎、烹饪、家庭护理和其他日常责任方面发挥着同等作用。在部落中的地位通常随着年龄的增长和与社区其他成员形成的关系而提高，无论是通过养育子女、友谊、恋爱、教学还是其他方式。莱昂宁妇女倾向于留在她们母亲的部落中，而男性在找到伴侣后往往会离开，加入新的部落。女族长委员会为大多数族群做出决定，这些领导人从族群中最年长或最受尊敬的妇女中产生。",
	"Generally, leonin communities avoid outsiders, particularly armed groups of soldiers and champions of the gods. Many leonin suffered under the rule of the archons and at the whim of fickle gods, a grim history that taught them well-remembered lessons about trusting strangers or relying on deities. Most leonin understand that people aren't their culture, though, and individuals who prove themselves trustworthy might find gradual acceptance among the prides. Even so, leonin prides accept centaurs, minotaurs, and satyrs more readily than unpredictable humans and alien tritons.": "一般来说，利安人社区避免外来者，特别是武装的士兵和神灵的拥护者。许多利奥宁人在弓箭手的统治下受苦受难，任由善变的神灵摆布，这段残酷的历史让他们对信任陌生人或依赖神灵有了深刻的认识。不过，大多数利奥宁人明白，人们并不是他们的文化，而那些证明自己值得信赖的人可能会在骄傲中逐渐被接受。即便如此，利安人的骄傲们还是更容易接受半人马、牛头人和萨提尔，而不是不可预知的人类和外来的三体人。",
	"Leonin prides typically occupy dens or mobile tent cities, or possibly both at different times of the year. Their dens commonly lie amid the foothills at the edge of Oreskos, particularly along the Oraniads to the east. Dens are usually comprised of small, interconnected networks of underground chambers. Large, shared spaces in these dens are typically decorated with rich woven textiles, bone crafts, and rich clay and crystal pottery. The dens are cool in the summers, but leonin are a sun-loving people and prefer to be outside—even sleeping outdoors—whenever weather permits.": "莱昂宁的傲慢者通常占据巢穴或移动帐篷城市，或者在一年中的不同时期可能同时占据这两个地方。他们的巢穴通常位于奥雷斯科斯边缘的山麓中，特别是沿奥拉尼亚德向东。巢穴通常是由小型的、相互连接的地下室网络组成的。这些巢穴中的大型共享空间通常用丰富的编织品、骨质工艺品以及丰富的粘土和水晶陶器进行装饰。洞穴在夏天很凉爽，但利安人是一个喜欢阳光的民族，只要天气允许，他们更喜欢在户外活动，甚至在户外睡觉。",
	"Numerous beasts migrate across Oreskos during the spring and fall. During this time, hunters from nearly every leonin pride participate in extended expeditions. In some cases, the entire pride takes part, emptying their dens to journey across the plains. While on the hunt, prides dwell in lavish tent-cities, largely comprised of tents capable of housing whole families. These temporary homes surround brightly colored pavilions, where craftspeople turn game into meals, clothing, and materials, honoring their animal neighbors by wasting nothing. While these encampments are obvious and well supplied, they are also heavily guarded by wary leonin. As a result, strangers who approach such camps tend to receive cold receptions.": "在春季和秋季，许多野兽在奥里斯克群岛上迁移。在这段时间里，几乎每个狮群的猎人都会参加长时间的探险活动。在某些情况下，整个狮群都会参加，清空他们的巢穴，穿越平原的旅程。在狩猎期间，狮群居住在豪华的帐篷城市，主要由能够容纳整个家庭的帐篷组成。这些临时住所围绕着色彩鲜艳的亭子，工匠们把猎物变成食物、衣服和材料，通过不浪费任何东西来纪念他们的动物邻居。虽然这些营地很明显，而且供应充足，但它们也被警惕的利尼人严密看守。因此，接近这些营地的陌生人往往会受到冷遇。",
	"As the sun rises on this festival day, the leonin gather to renew pacts of friendship. The matriarchs of all the prides hold council during this time. As dusk falls, the council announces a new speaker. A fantastic celebration ensues, involving dancing, feasting, singing, public professions of deep feelings, and trading oaths.": "当太阳在这个节日里升起的时候，列宁人聚集在一起，重新签订友谊的契约。所有王族的族长都在这个时候召开会议。当黄昏降临时，理事会宣布了新的发言人。一场奇妙的庆祝活动随之展开，包括舞蹈、盛宴、歌唱、公开表达深厚感情和交易誓言。",
	"Traditionally, the speaker reigns for a single year. As the leonin have grown less isolated, though, they have come to explore greater continuity in their leadership, and the current speaker, Brimaz, has held the office for several years. One of the few men to ever be speaker, he is broadminded, humble, and determined, with a deep connection to the land. He is quick to seek opinions from the matriarchs of the leonin prides, and often defers to their wisdom. While his focus has largely been within the grasslands' borders, he cautiously explores engaging in trade with the human poleis": "传统上，议长的任期只有一年。不过，随着列宁人越来越不与世隔绝，他们已经开始探索领导层的更大连续性，现任议长布里马兹已经担任了几年的职务。他是为数不多的曾经担任过议长的人之一，他心胸宽广，谦逊而坚定，与土地有着深厚的联系。他很快就会向利昂人的女族长们征求意见，并经常听从他们的智慧。虽然他的注意力主要集中在草原的边界上，但他谨慎地探索与人类极地的贸易。",
	"One collection of leonin prides, the Ironmanes, doesn't recognize the authority of the speaker. These fearsome warriors live in the foothills of the western Katachthon mountains, acknowledging no authority but their own. The warriors of the tribe stain their fur with rust to declare their status and ornament themselves with claws and small bones taken from defeated opponents. While intensely territorial, the Ironmanes sometimes offer their services as guards or guides, though they generally disdain working for anyone but other leonin. Numerous leonin fighters and rangers count themselves as Ironmanes.": "一个利安人的骄傲的集合，铁人，不承认说话者的权威。这些可怕的战士生活在卡塔赫松山脉西部的山脚下，除了他们自己的权威外，不承认任何权威。该部落的战士们用铁锈染上他们的皮毛，以宣布他们的地位，并用从被打败的对手身上取下的爪子和小骨头来装饰自己。虽然铁人的领地性很强，但他们有时也会提供警卫或向导的服务，不过他们一般不屑于为除其他利安人之外的任何人工作。许多利安人战士和游侠都把自己当作铁人。",
	"True children of Oreskos, the Sun Guides have lived in the grasslands for countless generations. They know the way of Oreskos's beasts and seasons better than any. Both mystical and knowledgeable, the Sun Guides read the messages in plant growth and animal migrations, and make their place in the natural cycle.": "太阳向导是奥雷斯科的真正孩子，他们在草原上生活了无数个世代。他们比任何人都更了解奥雷斯科斯的野兽和季节的方式。太阳向导既神秘又博学，他们读懂了植物生长和动物迁徙中的信息，并在自然循环中找到了自己的位置。",
	"Sun Guide prides might be found throughout Oreskos, but most orbit the lake known as Sun's Mirror. While these prides sometimes seek their dens during the harshest winters, many will spend years on the open plains. Many druids, monks, rangers, and sorcerers hail from Sun Guide prides.": "太阳引导者的骄傲可能会在整个奥雷斯科被发现，但大多数都围绕着被称为太阳之镜的湖。虽然这些傲慢者有时会在最严酷的冬天寻找他们的巢穴，但许多人会在开放的平原上度过数年。许多德鲁伊、僧侣、游侠和巫师都来自 \"太阳之镜 \"部落。",
	"Among the greatest hunters of Oreskos, the Swiftclaws are known for speed and efficiency. Their hunts are known to be among the shortest and most fruitful. While their martial prowess earns them respect, it also affords many leonin more time to share tales and study the lore of their people. As a result, some of the greatest leonin storytellers and historians number among the Swiftclaws. Fighters and rogues are also common among the Swiftclaws, and many bards and wizards come from these prides as well.": "在奥里斯科最伟大的猎手中，迅雷兽以速度和效率著称。众所周知，他们的狩猎是最短的，也是最有成果的。虽然他们的武艺高强为他们赢得了尊重，但这也让许多利安人有更多的时间来分享故事和研究他们民族的传说。因此，一些最伟大的利安人讲故事的人和历史学家都在迅猛龙人中。迅猛龙人中的战士和流氓也很常见，许多吟游诗人和巫师也来自这些骄傲。",
	"Unspoiled by roads or buildings, Oreskos is a land of striking natural beauty, where the plains and sky appear to go on forever. Craggy stone formations and ancient ruins dot windswept grasslands and plateaus, shading into scrubby badlands, rocky hills, and unwelcoming mountains. At the sun's height, the grasslands shine like beaten gold, and the sunsets are incomparable. Magnificent storms spread clouds in a rainbow of colors, creating vistas exhilarating to those brave enough to weather them. The hills yield ancient treasures and a bounty of precious metals and stones. At night, the movements of Nyx are striking, but images of the gods seem to keep their distance from this land where few pay them honor.": "在没有道路或建筑的情况下，奥雷斯科斯是一片具有惊人自然美的土地，那里的平原和天空似乎永远不会停止。陡峭的石头构造和古老的遗迹点缀着风吹草低见牛羊的草原和高原，逐渐变成灌木丛生的坏境、岩石山丘和不受欢迎的山脉。在太阳的高度，草原像被打过的金子一样闪闪发光，日落也是无可比拟的。壮观的风暴使云层呈现出彩虹般的色彩，为那些勇于承受的人创造了令人振奋的美景。山上有古老的宝藏和丰富的贵重金属和宝石。夜晚，Nyx的运动非常引人注目，但诸神的形象似乎与这片土地保持距离，很少有人向他们致敬。",
	"Yet most non-leonin will never see this beauty. The leonin prides guard their lands implacably, and without a good reason to be there—or a leonin guide to vouch for one's presence—outsiders are often chased away.": "然而，大多数非利诺人永远不会看到这种美丽。Leonin的骄傲们无情地守护着他们的土地，如果没有一个好的理由，或者没有一个Leonin的向导来证明自己的存在，外来者往往会被赶走。",
	"Tethmos serves as the default capital for Oreskos, a meeting place for the tribes, and the home of leonin leaders. Stone buildings and slender windmills jut above the plain, their pale colors and metal decorations shimmering in the light and changing color as the sun moves across the sky.

	"But to the north of Phoberos, far from the walls of Akros, stands the sprawling, labyrinthine polis of Skophos.

	"The founding of Skophos and its troubled history with Akros are the stuff of myth, and it is difficult to distinguish the mortal history of the two poleis from tales of the twin gods, Iroas and Mogis. The gods warred with each other, their followers and champions vied for control of scarce land, and two ideals—the nobility of heroic struggle and victory versus the brutality of savage slaughter in war—competed for a place in the mortal mind. Just as Mogis is the dark shadow of everything Iroas stands for, so is Skophos the reflection of Akros. And Phoberos is the bloodstained battleground where the eternal conflict between the gods and their poleis is waged.": "斯科福斯的建立及其与阿克罗斯的动荡历史是神话的内容，而且很难将这两个极地的凡人历史与双神伊罗亚斯和莫吉斯的故事区分开来。两位神互相争斗，他们的追随者和拥护者争夺稀缺土地的控制权，两种理想--英雄斗争和胜利的崇高性与战争中野蛮屠杀的残酷性--在凡人心中争夺一席之地。正如Mogis是Iroas所代表的一切的黑暗阴影，Skophos也是Akros的反映。而菲比罗斯是血迹斑斑的战场，诸神和他们的极乐世界之间的永恒冲突就在这里展开。",

Some Ragegores have been known to fall dead immediately at the cessation of battle, their life sustained only by their fury.": "拉格戈尔牛头人是他们中最凶残的一类，深深地被莫吉斯的嗜血欲望所感染。拉格戈尔牛头人在战斗中从不退缩，一看到敌人的鲜血就会进入狂暴的喜悦状态。在激烈的战斗中，拉格戈尔牛头人似乎感觉不到疼痛，几乎没有注意到会杀死人类的伤口。据了解，有些拉格戈尔牛头人在战斗结束后立即死亡，他们的生命只靠愤怒来维持。",

The fortress-palaces of tyrants, the lairs of monstrous oracles, and cavernous indoor markets also stand as destinations at the end of confounding avenues.": "斯科福斯就像一个字面上的迷宫，其扭曲的街道由坏境的红色砂岩雕刻而成。迷宫的墙壁上耸立着狭窄的建筑，作为家庭、商店和城市中以牛头人为主的可防御的堡垒。巨大的石块耸立在迷宫中，包括莫吉斯（最突出的）、埃雷波斯、凯拉诺斯和珀弗罗斯的神庙。暴君的堡垒宫殿、可怕的神谕者的巢穴和洞穴般的室内市场也都是令人困惑的大道尽头的目的地。",
	"Priests and warlord champions of Mogis rule the city, with individuals serving as tyrants over city districts.

Only the priests of Mogis can force the city's leaders to put aside their quarrels and work toward a single goal.": "莫吉斯的牧师和军阀冠军统治着这座城市，个人担任城市各区的暴君。城市的统治者们很少举行会议，即使举行了会议，那些争吵不休的暴君们也很少能找到共同的理由或达成协议的基础。只有莫吉斯的祭司能迫使城市的领导人放下他们的争吵，为一个单一的目标而努力。",
	"The minotaurs of Skophos acknowledge the entire pantheon of gods, though they are far enough inland that they have little cause to honor Thassa, and many of them view Iroas as an enemy of their people.

	"In that context, the small temple known as the Lesser Peristyle is an oddity. Dedicated to Ephara, it is a place where minotaurs debate philosophy and strive to rein in the excesses of the tyrants who govern the city. The existence of Skophos is a testimony to the benefits of an ordered society, as Ephara teaches, and that self-evident lesson is the strongest argument that Ephara's handful of priests can make to justify their presence in the city. From that starting point, they pursue their vision of a better way of life, aspiring to nobler principles than senseless slaughter and better governance than iron-fisted tyranny. Under the leadership of the temple's priests—Haraksi, an ingenious smith and mother of eight, and Olakia the Torn, an oracle who experiences visions from both Mogis and Ephara—a school of minotaur philosophers aspires to a vision of Skophos that can coexist in some measure of peace with the wider world.": "在这种情况下，被称为小礼拜堂的小庙是一个奇怪的地方。献给埃法拉，这是一个牛头人辩论哲学的地方，并努力控制统治城市的暴君的过度行为。斯科福斯的存在证明了一个有秩序的社会的好处，正如艾法拉所教导的那样，这个不言而喻的教训是艾法拉为数不多的祭司们为证明他们在这个城市的存在而提出的最有力的论据。从这个出发点出发，他们追求他们对更好的生活方式的愿景，渴望比无意义的屠杀更高尚的原则，比铁腕的暴政更好的治理。在神庙的祭司--聪明的铁匠和八个孩子的母亲Haraksi和Olakia the Torn--一个能从Mogis和Ephara那里获得幻觉的神谕--的领导下，一派牛头人哲学家渴望实现Skophos的愿景，在某种程度上与更广泛的世界和平共存。",
	"Many grand temples to Mogis stand in Skophos, presenting a stark contrast to the crude shrines that usually serve as sites of worship for the god of fury. Near the center of the polis, one temple larger and more elaborate than the rest serves as a holy site and the seat of the minotaur government, called Mogis's Chalice.": "斯科福斯有许多供奉莫吉斯的宏伟庙宇，与通常作为狂怒之神崇拜场所的简陋神龛形成了鲜明的对比。在政体中心附近，有一座比其他寺庙更大、更精致的寺庙作为圣地和牛头人政府的所在地，被称为莫吉斯的圣杯。",

	"Most tritons make their homes in the Siren Sea, either migrating with the shifting tides or raising hidden cities of outlandish beauty. The majority are devoted servants of Thassa who rigorously protect her domain, often treating surface-dwelling sailors as trespassers. Tritons make most of their goods from materials harvested from the deep, but have also developed ingenious forms of metallurgy—largely based around volcanic sea vents—and chemical etching, crafting wares that rival those made on land. The endless array of life and unpredictable changes of the sea make tritons regular witnesses to wonders. As a result, most tritons have a natural curiosity, ever seeking to see and learn more, but know they'll never fathom all the wonders of the world.": "大多数特里顿人以塞壬海为家，要么随着潮汐的变化而迁徙，要么建立起美得离谱的隐秘城市。大多数人都是塔萨的忠实仆人，他们严格保护她的领地，经常把住在海面上的水手视为入侵者。天龙人的大部分产品都是从深海中获取的材料，但他们也发展了巧妙的冶金术--主要是基于火山海口和化学蚀刻，制作的物品可以和陆地上的物品相媲美。海洋中无穷无尽的生命和不可预知的变化使三体人经常见证各种奇迹。因此，大多数三体人都有天生的好奇心，不断寻求看到和学到更多的东西，但他们知道自己永远无法理解世界上的所有奇迹。",
	"Although numerous triton cultures exist throughout the Siren Sea, many of those closest to shore are led by priests of Thassa. Triton warriors enact their leaders' will, with many specializing in doing battle against massive beasts or ships sailing the surface. The most wary communities might even employ shorethieves, tritons adept at using magical disguises to infiltrate land-bound towns to watch and steal from \"dryfolk.\"": "尽管整个塞壬海存在着众多的海神文化，但许多最靠近海岸的海神文化是由塔萨的祭司领导的。三角兽战士执行他们领袖的意志，许多人专门与巨大的野兽或在海面上航行的船只作战。最警惕的社区甚至会雇佣岸上的盗贼，他们善于使用魔法伪装，潜入陆地上的城镇，观察和偷窃 \"旱地人\"。",
	"The Dakra Isles were created when Thassa wept over the death of Korinna, a triton queen killed by a human's harpoon. Where the god's tears fell onto the sea there exploded forth an isle suffused with immortal magic and memory. Ages later, the Dakra Isles—also called the Isles of Enchantment—harbor strange sights and fierce monsters. Thassa's power makes it impossible to keep an accurate chart of the islands' positions, which roam as they please. Thus, even the most famed locations appear on no map, and sailors might spot them when or wherever Thassa wills.

	"Nestled in the highlands of the Oraniad Mountains, the Skola Vale is blessed by Nylea, covered in lush grass, and dotted with copses of trees. Satyrs roam the comfortable valley with no need for permanent settlements, all their needs provided for by the valley's magic. According to legend, Nylea was so taken with the valley's beauty that she poured the contents of her wineskin onto the vale to make it flourish forever. When wild goats drank of this wine, they became the first satyrs who made the magical land their home.": "斯科拉谷地坐落在奥拉尼亚德山脉的高地，受到奈拉的祝福，覆盖着茂盛的草地，点缀着成片的树木。萨特人在舒适的山谷中漫游，不需要永久的定居点，他们的所有需求都由山谷的魔法提供。据传说，奈拉非常喜欢这个山谷的美丽，她把她的酒壶里的东西倒在山谷里，使它永远繁荣。当野山羊喝了这杯酒后，它们就成了第一批萨提尔，把这片神奇的土地当成了自己的家。",
	"While the Skola Vale is a place of revelry, it isn't without its dangers. The satyrs themselves can become too raucous in their merrymaking, and monsters lurk in the shadows of the trees and the surrounding mountains.": "虽然斯科拉谷是一个狂欢的地方，但也不是没有危险的。萨提尔们在狂欢中可能会变得过于喧闹，而怪物则潜伏在树木和周围山脉的阴影中。",
	"The satyrs of the Skola Vale are wild and free. They have taboos, but not laws, influence fluctuates constantly, and all are free to make merry in any way they please, so long as it doesn't impede on others' ability to do the same. Disagreements are typically turned into opportunities for public competition. Irreconcilable issues are usually solved by a strict application of \"you go over there, and you go over there.\" True intentional crimes, however, are violations known deep in the satyr soul. If needs be, revelry can halt in an instant to help someone who's been hurt, and true criminals are exiled from the Skola Vale for life. Satyrs quickly bury negative thoughts, though, and the loss of one friend merely leads them to redouble efforts to make more.": "斯科拉谷地的萨提尔是狂野而自由的。他们有禁忌，但没有法律，影响力不断波动，所有人都可以自由地以任何方式进行欢乐，只要不妨碍其他人做同样的事。分歧通常被转化为公共竞争的机会。不可调和的问题通常通过严格适用 \"你去那里，你也去那里 \"来解决。然而，真正的故意犯罪，是在萨特尔灵魂深处已知的违法行为。如果需要，狂欢可以在瞬间停止，以帮助受到伤害的人，而真正的罪犯会被终身放逐出斯科拉谷地。不过，萨特人很快就会埋葬消极的想法，失去一个朋友只会让他们加倍努力去交更多的朋友。",
	"Distinctions are few among satyrs, but several notable groups are detailed here.": "萨提尔之间的区别不大，但这里详细介绍了几个值得注意的群体。",
	"Dawngreets are satyr emissaries, explorers, and storytellers sent to other communities throughout the world. They arrange satyr-style celebrations wherever they go, spreading their people's carefree philosophies, praising Nylea, sharing news, and creating friends the Skola Vale can rely on when necessary.": "Dawngreets是派往世界各地其他社区的萨提尔使者、探险家和讲故事的人。他们无论走到哪里都会安排萨提尔式的庆祝活动，传播他们民族的无忧无虑的哲学，赞美奈拉，分享新闻，并在必要时创造斯科拉谷地可以依赖的朋友。",
	"A circle of satyr druids, Nylea's Favored protect the Skola Vale, restoring nature after damage by wildfires or too rowdy satyr parties. They also defend the vale by growing dense underbrush and supporting populations of wild beasts at their territory's borders.": "奈拉的宠儿是一个萨提尔德鲁伊的圈子，他们保护斯科拉谷地，在野火或太过喧闹的萨提尔派对破坏后恢复自然。他们还通过种植茂密的树丛和在领地边界支持野兽种群来保卫谷地。",
	"The closest people satyrs have to leaders are their sibyls, who are blessed with limited ability to see into the future. Sibyls warn the community when danger threatens the valley, select dawngreets, and oversee the \"initiation rites\" of the Cult of Horns. The oldest sibyl is a gray-furred satyr named Cresa. She insists that the more she drinks, the further she can see into the future.": "萨蒂尔人最接近于领导者的人是他们的sibyls，他们被赋予了有限的预见未来的能力。当危险威胁到山谷时，sibyls会向社区发出警告，选择道格，并监督角神教的 \"入教仪式\"。最古老的sibyl是一个名叫Cresa的灰毛萨提尔。她坚持认为，她喝得越多，就越能看到未来。",
	"Some non-satyrs looking for pleasure without consequences visit the Skola Vale, encouraged by dawngreets and tales of wild revels. After spending some time with the satyrs, dark-humored sibyls might invite outsiders to join the Cult of Horns. If they agree, the non-satyr might be crowned with a circlet of horns, marking them as \"stubs\" (for their crown's stubby horns). A period of hazing follows, where the stubs are enticed to perform menial or humiliating tasks. When the satyrs grow bored—or a respected, sober satyr steps in—the hazing ends, which typically results in the stub later waking up alone in the mountains. Most satyrs who participate in such ungenerous behavior are chided and are themselves made to serve at the next revel, but the satyr memory for consequences is short and the tradition persists. As for former stubs, most never share details about their experiences, their secrecy contributing to tales of dark rites and sinister enchantments in the vale.": "一些寻找快乐而不计后果的非萨提亚人在街道和狂欢故事的鼓励下，来到斯科拉谷地。在与萨提尔相处了一段时间后，幽默的西伯利亚人可能会邀请外来者加入角之教。如果他们同意，非萨提尔可能会被戴上一个角的圆环，将他们标记为 \"存根\"（因为他们的皇冠上有短小的角）。随后会有一段时间的欺凌，诱使这些 \"残角 \"去做一些琐碎或屈辱的工作。当萨提尔们感到厌烦时，或者有一个受人尊敬的、清醒的萨提尔介入时，欺凌就结束了，这通常会导致存根后来在山上独自醒来。大多数参与这种不道德行为的萨提尔都会受到责备，并被要求在下一次狂欢中服务，但萨提尔对后果的记忆很短，这种传统一直存在。至于以前的存根，大多数人从不分享关于他们经历的细节，他们的秘密促成了山谷中黑暗仪式和邪恶魔法的传说。",
	"The Skola Vale is a wild place where majestic animals run free, trees, vines, and bushes provide fruit, and Nylea's magic enhances the land. Plants and animals grow rapidly in the valley. The chaotic satyrs may upend a copse of trees one night only to have it regrow by morning. Most of the Skola Vale consists of greenery rolling over gentle hills. During the day, the vale's residents hunt small game and gather wild fruit for wine. Other predators, such as bears, lions, and rocs, hunt the region as well. Some of these beasts, whether predator or prey, have become Nyxborn legends that appear again and again through the generations, either as threats or the stuff of incredible meals. Satyrs speak of both Kexosrexsos the Braided Lion and Hulp the Pork Bird with equal awe.": "斯科拉谷地是一个狂野的地方，雄伟的动物自由奔跑，树木、藤蔓和灌木丛提供果实，奈拉的魔法增强了土地。植物和动物在山谷中迅速生长。混乱的萨提尔们可能会在一夜之间毁掉一片树丛，到了早上就会重新生长。斯科拉谷地的大部分地区都是在平缓的山丘上滚动的绿色植物。白天，谷地的居民猎杀小动物，采集野果酿酒。其他食肉动物，如熊、狮子和大象，也在该地区狩猎。其中一些野兽，无论是捕食者还是猎物，都已经成为Nyxborn的传说，一代又一代地出现，要么是威胁，要么是不可思议的食物。萨提尔们对辫子狮子Kexosrexsos和猪肉鸟Hulp都有同样的敬畏。",
	"The Skola Vale's trees grow in twisted, climbable shapes allowing inhabitants shady places to play and sleep. Dryads protect the largest of these trees, especially from drunken satyr antics. During the day, the copses are idyllic forests, filled with the music of panpipes. At night, though, the forests grow more menacing. Nocturnal monsters roam the wood—particularly chimeras, cockatrices, and harpies—striving to pick off drunken satyrs wandering alone after a revel. Satyrs rarely travel alone at night, believing that noise and music scare away evil, but revelers aren't always as wary as they should be.": "斯科拉谷地的树木以扭曲的形状生长，可供居民在阴凉处玩耍和睡觉。干将们保护着这些最大的树木，尤其是防止喝醉酒的萨提尔的滑稽行为。白天，这些树丛是田园诗般的森林，充满了风笛的音乐。然而，到了晚上，森林变得更加危险。夜间怪物在森林中游荡，特别是奇美拉、鸡冠花和女妖，它们都想在狂欢后挑走独自徘徊的醉酒的萨提尔。萨提尔很少在夜间单独旅行，他们相信噪音和音乐可以吓走邪恶，但狂欢者并不总是像他们应该的那样警惕。",
	"While folk wisdom holds that the eastern Oraniad Mountains are blessed by the gods, dark, older magic supposedly holds sway in the Katachthons. While the Katachthons are a smaller range than the Oraniads, they are harsher and more volcanically active, with regular avalanches, storms, and unpredictable microclimates. Clouds obscure heavenly signs, guides become disoriented, and explorers wander in ever-smaller circles. And above it all, dragons rule the range—fire-belching creatures whose bellies, it is said, are filled with the flames of Purphoros's forge.": "虽然民间智慧认为东部的奥拉尼亚德山脉受到众神的祝福，但黑暗的、更古老的魔法据说在卡塔赫斯山脉占据主导地位。虽然卡塔克顿山脉比奥拉尼亚德山脉小，但它们更加严酷，火山活动更频繁，经常发生雪崩、风暴和不可预测的小气候。云层遮蔽了天象，向导变得迷失方向，探险者在越来越小的圈子里徘徊。而在这一切之上，龙统治着这片山脉--据说它们的肚子里装满了珀弗罗斯锻造的火焰，是一种燃烧着烈火的生物。",
	"Those who live in the foothills of the Katachthons are loath to acknowledge any tales of wondrous treasure or mysterious creatures to be found there, only repeating a warning to travelers: if you must cross them, keep to the passes. The two passes, One-Eyed Pass and the Cypress Gates, aren't safe, but they are generally considered less lethal than attempts to blaze one's own trail.": "那些生活在卡塔克顿山麓的人不愿意承认任何关于在那里可以找到神奇宝藏或神秘生物的故事，只是重复警告旅行者：如果你必须穿越它们，请保持在通道上。独眼山口和柏树门这两个山口并不安全，但它们通常被认为比自己开辟道路的尝试更不致命。",
	"Visible from Akros, Mount Velus is an energetically active volcano. The fiery mountain serves as nothing less than Purphoros's home in the mortal world.": "从阿克罗斯可以看到，维鲁斯山是一座精力充沛的活火山。这座火热的山峰是珀弗洛斯在凡间的家。",
	"While the volcano has only erupted a few times since Akros's founding, those minor catastrophes were enough to demonstrate that a major eruption might destroy the entire region. Akroans regularly leave offerings at the foot of the volcano, and rigorously dissuade travelers from venturing up to the sacred peak, hoping to avert the great explosion they fear is coming.": "虽然自阿克罗斯建国以来，火山只爆发过几次，但那些小灾难足以证明，一次大爆发可能会摧毁整个地区。阿克罗斯人经常在火山脚下留下祭品，并严格劝阻旅行者不要冒险登上神圣的山峰，希望能避免他们担心的大爆炸的到来。",
	"While some adventurers have climbed to the volcano's caldera, met Purphoros, and lived, the god's anger isn't the only danger. A red dragon called Thraxes makes his home in the halls of Purphoros's first residence, which the god abandoned to create a larger and more ornate home deeper in the volcano. The dragon occasionally uses the old forge to craft his own creations, melting gold from his treasure hoard. He sometimes gives these creations to Purphoros as offerings. In exchange the god allows the dragon to stay in the volcano.": "虽然一些冒险家已经爬上了火山口，见到了珀弗洛斯，并活了下来，但神的愤怒并不是唯一的危险。一条名叫瑟拉克斯（Thraxes）的红龙在珀弗洛斯的第一个住所的大厅里安家，珀弗洛斯为了在火山深处建造一个更大、更华丽的住所而放弃了这个住所。这条龙偶尔会使用古老的锻炉来制作自己的作品，熔化他的宝藏中的黄金。他有时会把这些作品作为祭品送给珀弗洛斯。作为交换，神允许龙留在火山里。",
	"Purphoros's forge lies in the deepest part of Mount Velus, near a vast lava pool. The massive iron forge is surrounded by the finest ores, metals, and gems. Some of the greatest treasures Purphoros ever crafted are contained in the god's residence, a forge-palace warded by an enormous, gilded iron door. Occasionally these doors crack open, admitting a curious anvilwrought creature into the world, or burst wide, unleashing some manifestation of Purphoros's fury.": "珀弗罗斯的锻造厂位于维鲁斯山的最深处，靠近一个巨大的熔岩池。这个巨大的铁炉周围有最好的矿石、金属和宝石。珀尔福罗斯所制作的一些最伟大的宝物都在神的居所中，这是一个由巨大的镀金铁门守护的锻造宫殿。偶尔，这些门会裂开，接纳一个好奇的铁砧锻造的生物进入这个世界，或者爆裂开来，释放出珀弗洛斯的愤怒的某些表现。",
	"Mount Vesios, also known as the Little Sister, is a smaller volcano that resembles Mount Velus and erupts concurrently with Velus. A monastery on its western slope houses scholars and spellcasters who study the volcano, believing that through it, they might be able to control the eruptions of Mount Velus.

	"The Oraniad mountains stretch along the east side of Oreskos. While they don't share the dark reputation of their western neighbor, they are the more dangerous territory. Tall, timeless mountains, the Oraniads are said to be closer to Nyx than any other point on Theros. Ancient shrines lie among the lonely peaks, their origins lost to mortal memory, and their halls haunted by mysterious supernatural phenomena. A wanderer might come upon a shrine to a forgotten god, only to find it gone upon looking back. Travelers might also catch glimpses of mysterious creatures here, beings that should have long ago passed into Nyx, or that have slipped from the divine realm before the gods intended from them to appear upon the world.": "奥拉尼亚德山脉沿奥雷斯科斯的东侧延伸。虽然它们没有西部邻居的黑暗声誉，但它们是更危险的领土。高大而永恒的山脉，据说奥拉尼亚德比塞洛斯的任何其他地方都更接近尼克斯。孤独的山峰间坐落着古老的神殿，它们的起源已被凡人的记忆所遗忘，而它们的大厅则被神秘的超自然现象所萦绕。一个流浪者可能会遇到一个被遗忘的神的神龛，但在回头看时却发现它已经消失了。旅行者也可能瞥见这里的神秘生物，这些生物应该早就进入了尼克斯，或者在诸神打算让他们出现在这个世界上之前就已经从神界溜走。",

Its position at the peak of Mount Carian affords it an unobstructed view of the horizon in all directions.

Unseen in the heavens above, these pillars connect to counterparts in an identical temple in the foyer to Nyx—the entrance, as it were, to the realm of the gods. The few brave souls that complete a pilgrimage to Nykthos and sleep on the peak experience extremely vivid dreams of divine entities, sometimes talking with the gods themselves or gaining visions of the future.": "寺庙建在高山上的广阔平原上，在一片星罗棋布的大理石地上形成一个强大的半圆形。它位于卡里安山的顶峰，使它可以毫无遮拦地看到各个方向的地平线。众神、冠军和神谕的雕像装饰着神殿，每个神都在一个独特的凹槽里有一个祭坛。高耸的光柱从每个祭坛升起，消失在繁星点点的夜空中。在天上看不见的地方，这些柱子与尼克斯门厅中相同的神庙中的对应物相连接--就像它的入口一样，通往众神的领域。少数勇敢的灵魂完成了对奈克瑟斯的朝圣，并在山顶上睡觉，经历了极其生动的神灵之梦，有时会与神灵本人交谈，或获得未来的幻觉。",

	"Among the northern Oraniads stands a blizzard-gripped mountain that resembles a volcano. What breathes forth from the crater isn't fire, though. The caldera's interior is coated with ice so cold it freezes anything it touches. Even the fumes that issue forth cause instant frostbite. At the volcano's heart stands a glass statue of a haunting, androgynous figure offering a diamond crown. None who have attempted to claim this strange gift have survived. Even the gods prove reticent to speak of the place, denying its existence or speaking of it with shame.": "在北部的Oraniads中，矗立着一座被暴风雪覆盖的山峰，类似于一座火山。不过，从火山口喷出的不是火。火山口的内部覆盖着冰层，冷得让它接触到的任何东西都冻结起来。即使是喷出的烟雾也会立即造成冻伤。在火山的中心矗立着一座玻璃雕像，雕像上有一个令人神魂颠倒的雌雄同体的人物，戴着一顶钻石皇冠。试图索取这一奇怪礼物的人都没有活下来。即使是众神也不愿意谈论这个地方，否认它的存在或羞于谈论它。",

To do so would be to lose the faith of their followers, the source of their magic and a power they will not relinquish.": "尼克斯是一个无尽的存在平面，潜能和信仰的力量在其中发挥着作用。它是众神的领域，是被赋予形式的信仰，是梦境，是崛起和消亡的哲学。在这里，泰罗斯的万神殿监视着凡人世界，并指导着生活。虽然众神生活在一个名副其实的天堂，但他们不能将自己与凡人世界割裂开来。这样做将会失去他们追随者的信仰、他们的魔法来源和他们不会放弃的力量。",

Some speculate that this orb is the source of Nyx's vibrant colors and lights, and that without it, the plane would be plunged into eternal darkness. Several gods make their homes on the mountain's slopes. Heliod maintains a sprawling palace of gold and white marble, with a rooftop throne where he receives guests. Purphoros maintains a forge beneath the mountain, where he crafts philosophies, energies, and creations that would be impossible to manifest in the mortal world.

(See {@book chapter 2|DMG|1} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} for details on planar arrangements.)": "大多数人都认为冥界的各个区是相互叠加的，但它们之间的实际关系却让凡人无法理解。虽然塔提克斯河到达每个区，但菲利亚斯通常被定义为冥界的入口，而泰泽斯离这个入口最远。其他区在两者之间拥有自己的平等位置。无论如何，注定要去每个领域的灵魂以同等的效率和持久性到达目的地。(关于平面安排的细节，请看{@book chapter 2|DMG|1}的{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}。)",
	"Although vast beyond understanding, the Underworld's most noteworthy regions are detailed here.": "虽然广阔得无法理解，但这里详细介绍了冥界最值得注意的地区。",
	"The Tartyx forms the boundary between the mortal realm and the Underworld. It is also known as the Rivers That Ring the World, as it is formed from the confluence of five tributaries, each originating in one of the Underworld's five wards. The Tartyx is vast, with one far shore impossible to see from the other. Countless drifting islands dot the river, some forested by leafless trees, others heaped with crumbling ruins. Still others are the domains of powerful demons and strange entities that death proves not quite able to claim. None of these tiny lands are hospitable to either the living or the dead. Even the waters of the Tartyx hold their own threats, both mysterious creatures that slither beneath its rippling waters, and their own infamous power to wash away memories and all sense of identity.": "塔提克斯河构成了凡人界和冥界的边界。它也被称为 \"环游世界的河流\"，因为它是由五条支流汇合而成的，每一条都发源于冥界的五个区之一。塔尔蒂克斯河很宽广，从另一个地方无法看到远处的海岸。无数漂流的岛屿点缀在河面上，有些被无叶的树木覆盖，有些则堆满了破碎的废墟。还有一些是强大的恶魔和奇怪的实体的领地，而死亡证明它们并不完全能够要求。这些狭小的土地对生者和死者都不友好。即使是塔提克斯河的水也有自己的威胁，包括在水波荡漾下的神秘生物，以及它们自己臭名昭著的力量，可以冲走记忆和所有的身份感。",
	"Agonas is the last home of warriors and soldiers who battled in life without honor, as well as the souls of cowards, mercenaries, and others who lived by the sword. Their cries of pain and triumph echo on the faintest wind, stirring bloodlust in all who hear them.": "阿戈纳斯是那些在生活中毫无荣誉地战斗的战士和士兵的最后家园，也是懦夫、雇佣兵和其他靠剑生存的人的灵魂。他们痛苦和胜利的呼喊在最微弱的风中回荡，激起了所有听到他们的人的嗜血欲望。",
	"The clash of weapons echo over every ridge and canyon of Agonas's rocky expanse. Great stadiums and platforms rise from the arid landscape, some carved from the remains of titanic ruins, others hanging from massive, rusting chains. The many theaters of battle blend with dwellings carved into natural rock towers, forming an extensive network of arenas and errant fortifications. At the ward's heart thrums the Stadium of Dishonor. Here fierce soldiers test their blades against one another and against the teeth and claws of vicious monsters.": "武器的碰撞声回荡在阿戈纳斯岩石地带的每一个山脊和峡谷。巨大的体育场和平台从干旱的地貌中升起，有些是由巨大的废墟遗迹雕刻而成，有些则悬挂在巨大的、生锈的铁链上。众多的战场与雕刻在天然岩石塔上的住宅相融合，形成了一个广泛的竞技场和错误的防御工事网络。在病房的中心地带，\"耻辱体育场 \"在颤动。在这里，凶猛的士兵们互相测试他们的武器，并与凶恶的怪物的牙齿和爪子对抗。",
	"The souls that occupy Phylias were uninspired and didn't strive for greatness in life. They plodded through existence and left no mark upon the world through their deeds or their deaths. In the afterlife they perform repetitive tasks in close quarters with others just like themselves, all in a mockery of a living community.": "占据菲利亚斯的灵魂没有灵感，没有为生活中的伟大而奋斗。他们在生存中蹒跚而行，没有通过他们的行为或他们的死亡给世界留下任何痕迹。在来世，他们与其他和他们一样的人一起在近距离内执行重复的任务，所有这些都是对生活社区的嘲弄。",
	"Artless architecture of plain, gray stone gives Phylias an outward appearance of normalcy at first glance. But the buildings are titanic, blocky masses of hodgepodge construction erected seemingly without plan. Although the structures might be impressive in size or number, they are cold and hollow, derelict monuments in an endless slum.": "朴实无华的灰色石头建筑让菲利亚斯乍一看有种正常的外在形象。但是，这些建筑是巨大的、块状的大杂烩建筑，似乎没有计划地竖立起来。虽然这些建筑在规模和数量上可能令人印象深刻，但它们是冰冷和空洞的，是无尽贫民窟中的废弃纪念碑。",
	"Those who arrive in Phylias are met by no one. They are simply left to wander away and slip into a place among the shuffling masses.": "那些到达菲利亚斯的人没有人迎接他们。他们被简单地抛在一边，溜进洗牌的人群中。",
	"In Ilysia the souls of heroic mortals and of those who died unjustly find eternal rest and comfort. Erebos's grim influence holds no sway here.": "在伊利西亚，英雄的凡人和那些不公正地死去的人的灵魂得到了永恒的休息和安慰。埃里伯斯的严峻影响在这里没有影响。",
	"Ilysia is a sanctuary of peace and tranquility. Majestic temple-palaces stand amid lush forests, the colorful vegetation draping luminous marble in living mantles of flowers and sweet fruit. At the ward's heart towers the Citadel of Destiny, where heroic souls gather to honor the gods, trade tales of glory, and feast with worthy companions. They also hold elaborate physical contests in which any Ilysian soul is welcome to participate.": "伊利西亚是一个和平与安宁的圣地。宏伟的寺庙宫殿矗立在郁郁葱葱的森林中，五颜六色的植被使发光的大理石披上了鲜花和甜美的果实的活体衣。在病房的中心，耸立着命运城堡，英雄的灵魂聚集在这里，向诸神致敬，交换荣耀的故事，并与有价值的伙伴共进晚餐。他们还举行精心设计的体能竞赛，欢迎任何伊利安的灵魂参加。",
	"When the worthy dead arrive in Ilysia, they are welcomed by dryads, majestic chimeras, or the souls of legendary heroes.": "当有价值的死者到达伊利亚时，他们会受到干尸、雄伟的奇美拉或传奇英雄的灵魂的欢迎。",
	"Nerono is the final home of souls haunted by their memories and of mariners who were lost at sea.": "尼罗诺是被记忆困扰的灵魂和在海上迷失的海员的最后家园。",
	"Vast oceans fill Nerono, a realm dotted by lonely islands and crisscrossed by aimless ships. Titanic ruins and great, algae-slick chains rise out of the sea, as do the weathered hulls of legendary shipwrecks. The sky is a misty blur of color that hangs over water as still as glass. Despite the ocean's normally placid appearance, mighty storms often arise from nowhere, casting souls into waves and whirlpools by the scores. Somewhere within the great oceans hides a twisting tangle of tides and winds called the Labyrinth of Memories. This maze of waterways confounds unwary travelers and twists their course into an inescapable path for eternity.": "辽阔的海洋充斥着奈洛诺，这个领域被孤独的岛屿所点缀，漫无目的的船只纵横交错。泰坦尼克号的废墟和巨大的、沾满海藻的链条从海中升起，传说中的沉船的风化的船体也是如此。天空是一片模糊的色彩，悬挂在像玻璃一样静止的水面上。尽管海洋通常是平静的，但强大的风暴常常不知从何而来，将灵魂抛入海浪和漩涡中，数以百计。在大洋的某处，隐藏着一个由潮汐和风组成的曲折纠结，被称为 \"记忆的迷宫\"。这个水路的迷宫迷惑着不小心的旅行者，并将他们的路线扭曲成一条无法逃脱的永恒之路。",
	"The deepest ward of the Underworld, Tizerus is the final punishment of murderers and those who committed unforgivable offenses against the gods themselves.": "泰泽鲁斯是冥界最深的病房，是对杀人犯和那些对诸神本身犯下不可饶恕的罪行的最终惩罚。",
	"The ward is a gloomy, miserable expanse where the ruins of titanic architecture loom over a wasteland of black rock. At its center looms Erebos's palace, an ominous structure of polished darkness embellished with gold ornaments and streamers of crimson silk. The god of the Underworld broods in his halls, occasionally striking out with his lash to drag wayward souls into his realm. Deep beneath the palace lies the lone glimmer of hope amid the ward's gloom: the portal called Lathos, which leads back to the world of the living. Beyond Erebos's palace sprawls a stinking swamp of rotting muck and dead vegetation known as the Mire of Punishment. Souls trapped there suffer eternal torment at the claws of demons and other monstrous creatures.": "病房是一片阴暗、悲惨的地方，泰坦建筑的废墟在黑色岩石的荒地上隐约可见。在它的中心，埃里伯斯的宫殿若隐若现，这是一个由抛光的黑暗组成的不祥的结构，上面点缀着金色的装饰品和深红色的丝绸流苏。冥界之神在他的大厅里发呆，偶尔会用他的鞭子抽打，把不听话的灵魂拖进他的领域。在宫殿的深处，在病房的阴暗中隐藏着唯一的希望之光：名为Lathos的门户，它通向活人的世界。在埃里伯斯的宫殿之外，有一片由腐烂的泥土和枯萎的植物组成的恶臭沼泽，被称为惩罚之沼。被困在那里的灵魂在恶魔和其他畸形生物的爪下遭受永恒的折磨。",
	"When souls damned to Tizerus arrive, they quickly find themselves dragged away in a whirlwind of pain and terror. Demons, Underworld harpies, lamias, and nightmares compete for the chance to haul the doomed away to their own personal punishments.": "当被诅咒到Tizerus的灵魂到达时，他们很快发现自己被拖到了痛苦和恐怖的旋风中。恶魔、冥界女妖、拉米亚人和恶梦都在争夺机会，将注定要被拖走的人带到他们自己的个人惩罚中。",
	"Can the gods determine my fate?\" Elspeth asked. \"What is truly the extent of their power? Can they make what I want happen—if only I please them enough?\"": "诸神能决定我的命运吗？\" 埃尔斯珀斯问道。\"他们的权力到底有多大？他们能使我想要的事情发生吗--只要我足够取悦他们？\"",
	"\"If you want a god to determine your fate, you must ask the god for an ordeal,\" Sarpedon said. \"They will only grant it if they think you are worthy—whatever 'worthy' means for them. If you accomplish it, you may request a hand in your own destiny.\"": "\"如果你想让一个神来决定你的命运，你必须向神请求一个磨难，\"萨尔佩顿说。\"他们只有在认为你值得时才会同意--不管'值得'对他们意味着什么。如果你完成了它，你可以要求参与你自己的命运。\"",
	"As exemplified by the labors of Anthousa, the exploits of Haktos the Unscarred, the wondrous inventions of Dalakos, and Elspeth's escape from the Underworld, the heroes of Theros chart their own fates—and so will the player characters in your campaign.": "正如安托萨的劳作、无畏者哈克托斯的探索、达拉克斯的奇妙发明以及埃尔斯珀斯从冥界的逃脱所体现的那样，特洛斯的英雄们规划着自己的命运--你的战役中的玩家角色也将如此。",
	"What adventures might Heliod's champions undertake? What villains and monsters are associated with Phenax? How might adventurers get entangled in divine schemes? This chapter explores these questions, providing abundant advice, tools, and maps for players to create their own exciting stories. The options presented here expand on the material in {@book chapter 3|DMG|2} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to help you craft adventures for your own Theros campaign. Each god of Theros's pantheon has a section here, describing how the deity interacts with the mortal world. Beyond the gods, tools for running nautical odysseys and descents into the Underworld appear in this chapter, along with an adventure that explores the machinations of immortals and the dead.": "赫利奥德的冠军们可能会进行哪些冒险？哪些恶棍和怪兽与Phenax有关？冒险者会如何被神的计划所纠缠？本章探讨了这些问题，为玩家创造自己的精彩故事提供了丰富的建议、工具和地图。这里介绍的方案是对《{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}》中的材料的扩展，以帮助你为自己的Theros活动制作冒险。特洛斯万神殿的每个神都有一个章节，描述了该神如何与凡人世界互动。除了诸神之外，本章还介绍了进行航海探险和进入冥界的工具，以及探索不朽者和死者的阴谋的冒险。",
	"Three elements combine to form the adventures recounted in the epics of Theros: heroes, gods, and monsters. Each god's section in this chapter provides the ingredients to build your own epics: champions and blessings, villains and monsters, divine schemes, and adventure locations.": "三个元素结合在一起，形成了塞洛斯史诗中所叙述的冒险：英雄、神灵和怪物。本章中每个神的部分都提供了构建你自己的史诗的要素：冠军和祝福、恶棍和怪物、神圣的计划和冒险地点。",
	"Each god's entry in this chapter begins with a discussion of the god's champions: quests for them to undertake, how you might structure a campaign around that god's champions, and blessings the god might bestow.": "本章中每个神的条目都以讨论该神的拥护者开始：他们要承担的任务，你如何围绕该神的拥护者组织一场战役，以及该神可能赋予的祝福。",
	"Often, each of the characters in an adventuring party is the champion of a different god—or no god at all. What brings the characters together? How do you motivate the whole party? Consider these options:": "通常情况下，冒险队伍中的每个角色都是一个不同的神的拥护者，或者根本没有神。是什么把这些人物聚集在一起？你如何激励整个队伍？请考虑这些选项。",
	"The characters represent a coalition of gods who have joined forces against a common foe (or cabal of enemies). For example, you might build a campaign around the idea that Erebos, Mogis, and Pharika are conspiring to unleash slaughter and plague on the mortal realm. Perhaps heroic champions of Ephara, Heliod, Karametra, Nylea, and other gods unite to protect the world from this threat.": "这些角色代表了一个神的联盟，他们联合起来对抗一个共同的敌人（或一群敌人）。例如，你可以围绕这样一个想法开展活动：埃瑞博斯、莫吉斯和法里卡正在密谋对凡人界发动屠杀和瘟疫。也许埃法拉、赫利奥德、卡拉米特拉、奈拉和其他神明的英雄冠军们会联合起来保护世界免受这一威胁。",
	"If Thassa's champion helps Heliod's champion today, perhaps Heliod's champion will help Thassa's champion tomorrow. As long as the aims of gods aren't in opposition, those gods take no issue with their champions helping each other.": "如果Thassa的冠军今天帮助Heliod的冠军，也许Heliod的冠军明天会帮助Thassa的冠军。只要诸神的目标不是对立的，这些神对他们的冠军互相帮助没有异议。",
	"A group of characters might find themselves on a galley foundering in a storm, in a polis under attack, or on the same side in a war. In such a case, when divine champions contend against a common threat, their allegiance to different gods might be less important than the urgency of their current situation, and they might forge lasting friendships that transcend their religious allegiances.": "一群角色可能会发现自己在一艘在风暴中沉没的船上，在一个受到攻击的政体中，或者在一场战争中站在同一边。在这种情况下，当神圣的冠军们对抗共同的威胁时，他们对不同神灵的忠诚可能就不那么重要了，而他们可能会建立起超越宗教忠诚的持久友谊。",
	"A mortal champion is a vessel of divine power and an agent of divine will. A champion's role is to act as the god's eyes and hands, upholding the deity's ideals and shaping the world to conform to those ideals.": "凡人的冠军是神力的容器和神意的代理人。冠军的作用是作为神的眼睛和手，维护神的理想并塑造世界以符合这些理想。",
	"In return for the gods' divine blessings, champions are expected to do the god's bidding. The quests in each god's section throughout this chapter provide examples of tasks the gods might assign to their champions. As long as at least one member of the adventuring party is a champion of the god in question, these ideas might serve as adventure seeds.": "作为对诸神的神圣祝福的回报，冠军们要听从诸神的吩咐。本章中每个神的部分的任务提供了诸神可能分配给他们的冠军的任务的例子。只要冒险队伍中至少有一名成员是有关神的冠军，这些想法就可以作为冒险的种子。",
	"When a champion undertakes a quest on a god's behalf, the champion can expect a reward for doing so. As long as the champion is actively pursuing the quest and upholding the god's ideals along the way, you can increase the character's piety score, using the general rule of raising it by 1 every session. Upon completing a quest bestowed by the god, the character might earn a blessing (such as those described in this chapter) as well as a piety score increase.": "当一个冠军代表一个神进行任务时，冠军可以期望得到奖励。只要冠军积极追求任务，并在途中坚持神的理想，你就可以增加角色的虔诚分数，使用每节课增加1分的一般规则。在完成神赐予的任务后，角色可能会获得祝福（如本章所述的那些）以及虔诚分数的增加。",
	"The cost to a champion for refusing to accept a god's quest can be steep. Sometimes, a champion can safely put the task on hold for a time, such as when helping another champion complete a quest for a different god. As long as undertaking the quest isn't a matter of urgency, gods usually don't punish champions who procrastinate. But if a champion willfully ignores a god's quest or pursues opposite aims, they might suffer any of the following consequences:": "拒绝接受一个神的任务，冠军的代价可能很高。有时，冠军可以安全地将任务搁置一段时间，例如在帮助另一个冠军完成对不同神的任务时。只要执行任务不是一件紧急的事，神灵通常不会惩罚拖延的冠军。但如果一个冠军故意无视一个神的任务或追求相反的目标，他们可能会遭受以下任何后果。",
	"The character's piety score might decrease by 1 each day, or each play session, for as long as the character continues to refuse the quest.": "只要该角色继续拒绝任务，他的虔诚分每天或每个游戏环节都可能减少1分。",
	"The god might intervene to steer the champion toward the quest: Thassa could cause a storm to blow the character's ship off course, for example, bringing the champion to where the god wants them to be.": "神可能会干预，引导冠军去完成任务。例如，塔萨可以引起一场风暴，使角色的船偏离航线，把冠军带到神希望他们去的地方。",
	"In extreme instances, the god might place a magical command on the character, similar to a {@i g}{@i eas} spell.": "在极端情况下，神可能会给角色下达一个魔法指令，类似于{@i g}{@i eas}的咒语。",
	"Each god's entry in this chapter explores the themes and events that could drive a campaign focused on the champions or agenda of that god. Typically, in a campaign centered on a god, one or more of the player characters are champions of that god, so it's natural—and perhaps even necessary—for them to become directly embroiled in how events unfold.": "本章中每个神的条目都探讨了可以推动以该神的拥护者或议程为中心的活动的主题和事件。一般来说，在以神为中心的战役中，一个或多个玩家角色是该神的拥护者，所以他们直接卷入事件的发展中是很自然的，也许甚至是必要的。",
	"You can build a campaign around the villainous plans and deeds of a god, pitting the heroic adventurers against that god's servants and emissaries throughout their careers. Each god's entry offers suggestions on how such a campaign might progress. Additionally, a table of divine schemes suggests ambitions a god might pursue, or threats they might unleash, as a campaign's primary antagonist.": "你可以围绕一个神的邪恶计划和行为建立一个战役，让英雄的冒险者在他们的职业生涯中与该神的仆人和使者对抗。每个神的条目都提供了关于这种活动如何进展的建议。此外，一个神的计划表显示了一个神可能追求的野心，或者他们可能释放的威胁，作为一个活动的主要对手。",
	"Each god's section includes a map of an iconic location often associated with a specific god. The description of each location includes tables that list possible goals for an adventure based there and villains the characters might face there.": "每个神的部分都包括一张通常与特定神有关的标志性地点的地图。每个地点的描述都包括一些表格，列出了在那里进行冒险的可能目标和人物在那里可能面对的恶棍。",
	"Storm-tossed and broken, foundering,": "风雨交加，支离破碎，摇摇欲坠。",
	"Callaphe cried out to Thassa.": "卡拉佩向塔萨喊道。",
	"Tritons came swiftly to save her,": "天龙人迅速赶来救她。",
	"bringing her north to the Lindus.": "把她带到北边的林德斯。",
	"The gods are fond of meddling in mortal affairs, and heroes sometimes call on their gods for aid in times of desperate need. Spells such as {@spell divination} and {@spell commune} give characters the opportunity to ask their gods for information, and clerics who beseech their gods for assistance sometimes receive miracles in answer. Heroes also have the opportunity to ask the gods for favors, after proving their worth by enduring a divine ordeal.": "诸神喜欢插手凡人的事务，英雄们有时会在急需的时候向他们的神灵求援。诸如{@spell divination}和{@spell commune}这样的法术让人物有机会向他们的神灵询问信息，而向他们的神灵求援的牧师有时会得到神迹的回应。英雄们也有机会向神明求助，在通过忍受神圣的折磨来证明自己的价值之后。",
	"At other times, the gods take the initiative to reach out to mortal heroes, sending them on quests or meddling in their adventures. Dreams, omens, and emissaries are the most common means by which gods might make their wishes known.": "在其他时候，诸神会主动联系凡人英雄，派他们去做任务或干涉他们的冒险。梦境、预兆和使者是最常见的手段，众神可能通过这些手段来表达他们的愿望。",
	"Two crucial principles should guide your use of divine involvement in your campaign:": "在你的运动中使用神的参与，应遵循两个关键原则。",
	"The gods can tell characters to do things, and even threaten to punish them if they don't do things, but the gods can't control mortal actions.": "诸神可以告诉人物做事情，甚至威胁说如果他们不做事情就惩罚他们，但诸神不能控制凡人的行动。",
	"The intervention of a god should never guarantee success or victory, nor should a god's interference portend immediate defeat. Gods can act to change the balance of an encounter or offer an avenue of escape, but they count on their champions to be heroes and act accordingly.": "神的干预不应保证成功或胜利，神的干预也不应预示着立即失败。神明可以采取行动改变一场遭遇战的平衡，或者提供一条逃生的途径，但他们指望他们的冠军成为英雄并采取相应的行动。",
	"Communication between the mortal world and the divine can take a variety of forms, from omens that get mortals' attention by distorting natural phenomena to face-to-face conversations between a mortal and the manifestation of a god.": "凡人世界和神灵之间的沟通可以采取各种形式，从通过扭曲自然现象引起凡人注意的预兆，到凡人和神灵化身之间面对面的对话。",
	"As explained in {@book chapter 2|MOT|2}, the gods aren't all-knowing, so theoretical limits do exist on the information a god might be able to pass on to a human champion. That said, the gods are tremendously knowledgeable, with perfect recall of their past experiences and a reliable ability to predict the short-term future. The gods don't like to reveal their ignorance of any matter, so they might give a purposefully unclear or misleading answer rather than admit they don't know the right one.": "正如{@book chapter 2|MOT|2}中所解释的，众神并不是无所不知的，所以理论上，众神能够传递给人类冠军的信息确实存在限制。也就是说，众神知识渊博，对他们过去的经历有着完美的记忆，并有可靠的能力预测短期的未来。众神不喜欢暴露他们对任何问题的无知，所以他们可能会故意给出一个不明确或误导性的答案，而不是承认他们不知道正确的答案。",
	"When the lynx-constellation paces restlessly in the night sky, it is an omen that Nylea is worried. When the tides rise high in defiance of the natural cycle, that is an omen that Thassa is distressed. When rain falls on a sunny day, Keranos and Heliod must be in conversation. Through supernatural events such as these, evidence of the gods' presence and influence is demonstrated, metaphorically manifesting their divine wishes.": "当猞猁星座在夜空中不安地踱步时，这预示着奈拉在担心。当潮汐无视自然周期而高涨时，这预示着Thassa正在苦恼。当晴天下雨时，Keranos和Heliod一定在谈话。通过诸如此类的超自然事件，证明了诸神的存在和影响，隐喻着他们的神圣愿望。",
	"The gods usually send omens as either warnings or as signs of their favor. The response to the {@spell augury} spell takes the form of an omen foretelling weal or woe, and the gods might use omens in the same way, even without being asked to provide a sign. When a divine champion sets out on a course of action, a god might express approval or disapproval, hoping to either encourage or dissuade the mortal.": "诸神通常将预兆作为警告或作为他们青睐的标志。对{@spell augury}咒语的回应采取预示着成功或不幸的预兆的形式，而诸神可能以同样的方式使用预兆，即使没有被要求提供预兆。当一个神圣的冠军开始行动时，一个神可能会表示赞同或不赞同，希望鼓励或劝阻凡人。",
	"The {@spell augury} spell requests an omen. At your option, you can simply provide the short answers offered in the spell description—weal, woe, weal and woe, or nothing—but you can also describe more elaborate omens. The form of the response might vary depending on the method of divination used, which can go beyond the inlaid sticks, dragon bones, or ornate cards mentioned in the spell description. Diviners in Theros look for signs in the stars, in the patterns of flocks of birds in flight, in the shapes of clouds, in the organs of sacrificed animals, in the sounds of thunder, in the designs left by waves on sand, and through many other means. So if an oracle stands on a beach imploring Thassa for an augury regarding a course of action you believe to be disastrous, you might describe the waves washing over the beach—and circling around the oracle's feet, leaving them completely dry. (If necessary, though, you should clarify that the oracle knows the answer to be \"woe.\")": "{@spell augury}咒语要求一个预兆。根据你的选择，你可以简单地提供咒语描述中提供的简短答案--好的、坏的、好的和坏的，或者什么都没有，但你也可以描述更详细的预兆。答复的形式可能会根据所使用的占卜方法而有所不同，它可以超越咒语描述中提到的镶嵌的木棒、龙骨或华丽的卡片。泰罗斯的占卜者从星星、飞行中的鸟群图案、云朵的形状、牺牲的动物器官、雷声、海浪在沙地上留下的图案，以及其他许多手段中寻找征兆。因此，如果一个神谕者站在海滩上，向塔萨祈求关于你认为是灾难性的行动方案的预言，你可以描述海浪冲刷着海滩--在神谕者的脚边盘旋，让他们完全干燥。(如果有必要，你应该说明神谕者知道答案是 \"悲哀\"。）",
	"An omen can also have a more direct meaning beyond simply \"weal\" or \"woe.\" You can use omens to nudge the characters to an adventure location, to lead them to an oracle who lives far from the polis, or to hint at the true identity of a villain. Nylea might cause a flock of birds to suddenly rush eastward, inviting her champion to follow in that direction, or an animal might snarl whenever the villain's name is spoken. Omens should communicate important messages from the gods, something meaningful enough that deities have deigned to interfere in mortal efforts. The gods don't provide omens to address unimportant questions (unless the characters use a spell for this purpose).": "预兆也可以有更直接的含义，而不仅仅是 \"好事 \"或 \"坏事\"。你可以用预兆来推动人物去冒险，引导他们去找一个远离政区的神谕者，或者暗示一个恶棍的真实身份。Nylea可能会让一群鸟儿突然向东飞去，邀请她的冠军向那个方向追去，或者只要一说起小人的名字，动物就会咆哮。预兆应该传达来自神灵的重要信息，一些有意义的东西足以让神灵同意干预凡人的努力。诸神不会提供预兆来解决不重要的问题（除非角色为此目的使用了咒语）。",
	"A degree of mystery surrounds every omen, but the more complex an omen is, the more confusing mortals might find it. In addition, it's sometimes not clear whether a strange occurrence in the natural world is the work of the gods or has some other origin.": "每个预兆都有一定程度的神秘感，但预兆越复杂，凡人可能会觉得越困惑。此外，有时并不清楚自然界中发生的怪事是神的杰作还是有其他原因。",
	"If a character struggles to interpret the meaning of an omen, you might allow them to make a DC 14 Intelligence or Wisdom check (perhaps modified by proficiency in {@skill Arcana}, {@skill Nature}, or {@skill Religion}) to determine the nature of simple omens, with a success indicating that the correct message has been gleaned. Alternatively, characters might need to seek out oracles to interpret complicated omens for them.": "如果一个角色很难解释一个预兆的含义，你可以让他们进行DC14智力或智慧检查（也许可以通过对{@skill Arcana}、{@skill Nature}或{@skill Religion}的熟练程度进行修改）来确定简单预兆的性质，如果成功，说明已经收集到了正确的信息。另外，人物可能需要寻找神谕来为他们解释复杂的预兆。",
	"The tables on the following pages provide examples of phenomena that could serve as omens of the various gods. Although they each have their own areas of concern, any god can manipulate the natural world as they please. You can choose a god to closely align the omen with and roll either a {@dice d6} or a {@dice d8} to get an omen associated with that god, or you can roll a {@dice d100} to get an omen from any of the god's omen tables at random.": "以下几页的表格提供了可以作为各种神灵预兆的现象的例子。虽然他们各自有自己的关注领域，但任何神都可以随心所欲地操纵自然界。你可以选择一个神来密切配合预兆，并掷出{@dice d6}或{@dice d8}来获得与该神相关的预兆，或者你可以掷出{@dice d100}来从任何一个神的预兆表中随机获得一个预兆。",
	"Faintly glowing wisps of fog or mist coalesce into shapes in the air.": "发出微弱光芒的一缕缕雾气或薄雾在空中凝聚成形状。",

	"Clerics and oracles have spells at their disposal that allow them to ask the gods for insight. The {@spell divination} and {@spell commune} spells contact a god and promise a truthful reply to the caster's questions. The reply takes the form of a simple \"yes\" or \"no,\" a cryptic rhyme, or an omen. It might be transmitted through a disembodied voice, a vision only the caster can see, or any other mystical manner. A verbal reply to a {@spell divination} or {@spell commune} spell must be truthful, but it might still be misleading. A god can't speak a deliberate lie in response to either spell, but they can be evasive while remaining within the boundaries of the truth. If a character casts one of these spells more than once in the same day, however, there is an increasing chance of receiving an unclear answer or none at all (as described in the spells' entries in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}). This might happen because another god, alerted to the connection between the caster and their god by the first casting of the spell, intercepts the second one and chooses to mislead the character. Or it could simply mean that the god is tired of the character's pestering and chooses not to answer.": "牧师和神谕者都有法术可供他们使用，使他们能够向神明寻求洞察力。{@spell divination}和{@spell commune}的法术与神灵联系，并承诺对施法者的问题做出真实的回答。回答的形式包括一个简单的 \"是 \"或 \"不是\"，一个神秘的韵律，或一个预兆。它可能是通过一个不存在的声音，一个只有施法者能看到的幻象，或任何其他神秘的方式来传递。对{@spell divination}或{@spell commune}咒语的口头回答必须是真实的，但它仍然可能是误导性的。一个神不能在回应这两个咒语时说一个故意的谎言，但他们可以在保持真实的范围内进行回避。然而，如果一个角色在同一天内不止一次地施展这些法术，那么收到不明确的答案或根本没有答案的可能性就会越来越大（如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的法术条目所述）。这可能是因为另一个神在第一次施法时就注意到了施法者和他们的神之间的联系，于是拦截了第二次施法，并选择误导角色。也可能只是意味着该神厌倦了角色的纠缠，选择不回答。",
	"As with Callaphe the Mariner's desperate cry to Thassa, heroes in dire straits sometimes implore their gods for help. Occasionally, the gods answer. Whether a response is elicited by a hero's desperate prayer, a cleric's use of the Divine Intervention class feature, or a god's decision to intervene in mortal affairs for good or ill, an answer can manifest in a variety of ways.": "就像水手卡拉普向塔萨发出的绝望的呼喊一样，处于困境中的英雄有时会向他们的神灵求救。偶尔，诸神会做出回应。无论回应是由英雄绝望的祈祷引起的，还是由牧师使用神灵干预类功能引起的，或者是由神灵决定为善或为恶干预凡人的事务，回应都可以以各种方式表现出来。",
	"As described in {@book chapter 7|DMG|7|Blessings} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, the gods sometimes use blessings to reward their faithful servants for momentous deeds. Completing a quest bestowed by the god is an accomplishment that might merit a blessing as a reward. Occasionally, a god might also offer a blessing when sending a champion on a quest, helping them to prepare for the task ahead.": "正如(1%)的{@book chapter 7|DMG|7|Blessings}所述，神明有时会用祝福来奖励他们忠实的仆人的重大行为。完成神赐予的任务是一项成就，可能值得用祝福作为奖励。偶尔，神明也会在派遣冠军出征时提供祝福，帮助他们为未来的任务做好准备。",
	"A character retains the benefit of a blessing until it is taken away by the god who granted it, which might happen if a character's piety score is reduced. Unlike a magic item, a divine blessing can't be suppressed by an antimagic field or similar effect. There is no limit on the number of blessings a character can receive, but a character can't benefit from multiple applications of a blessing at the same time.": "一个角色可以保留祝福的好处，直到它被授予它的神灵拿走，如果一个角色的虔诚分被降低，这可能会发生。与魔法物品不同，神圣的祝福不能被反魔法场或类似的效果所压制。一个角色可以接受的祝福数量没有限制，但一个角色不能同时从一个祝福的多个应用中受益。",
	"requires piety 3 or higher": "需要虔诚度3或更高",
	"requires piety 10 or higher": "要求虔诚度10或更高",

	"requires piety 50 or higher": "要求虔诚度50或更高",
	"You can use these additional blessings for your campaign, or use them to inspire more supernatural gifts.": "你可以为你的运动使用这些额外的祝福，或者用它们来激发更多的超自然的礼物。",
	"As a bonus action, you can invoke your god's protection, providing you with a +1 bonus to your AC for 1 minute. Once you use this blessing, you can't use it again until the next dawn.": "作为一个额外的行动，你可以召唤你的神的保护，为你提供一个+1的AC奖励，持续1分钟。一旦你使用了这个祝福，你就不能再使用它，直到下一个黎明。",
	"When you are about to take acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to that damage type until the end of your next turn. Once you use this blessing, you can't use it again until the next dawn.": "当你即将受到酸、冷、火、闪电或雷的伤害时，你可以使用你的反应来获得对该伤害类型的抗性，直到你下一回合结束。一旦你使用了这个祝福，你就不能再使用它，直到下一个黎明。",
	"As an action, you can imbue your eyes with enhanced vision for 10 minutes. While the blessing is active, your eyes look like the starry void of Nyx, and you can see {@condition invisible} creatures and objects within 60 feet of you that are within your line of sight. Once you use this blessing, you can't use it again until the next dusk.": "作为一个动作，你可以给你的眼睛注入增强的视觉，持续10分钟。当祝福生效时，你的眼睛看起来就像Nyx的星空，你可以看到60英尺范围内处于你视线范围内的生物和物体（％0％）。一旦你使用这个祝福，在下一个黄昏之前，你不能再次使用它。",
	"A divine emissary is a creature woven from the fabric of Nyx as a tool to carry out a god's divine will. Emissaries have no will of their own; they are extensions of their creators' divine substance, brought into the mortal world to fulfill a specific mission. When that mission is complete, they return to Nyx.": "神圣的使者是一种从Nyx的结构中编织出来的生物，作为执行神的神圣意志的工具。神使没有自己的意志；他们是其创造者的神性物质的延伸，被带到凡人世界来完成一个特定的任务。当任务完成后，他们会回到尼克斯。",
	"While certain deities are associated with sending favored animals as their emissaries—such as the stag often associated with Heliod and Nylea's lynx—any animal might be a god's emissary. In each case, divine emissaries have a few shared characteristics:": "虽然某些神灵与派遣受宠的动物作为他们的使者有关--比如经常与赫利奥德（Heliod）和奈拉（Nylea）的猞猁有关的雄鹿--但任何动物都可能成为神的使者。在每种情况下，神的使者都有一些共同的特征。",
	"They are Nyxborn and have one or two of the Nyxborn traits described in {@book chapter 6|MOT|6|Nyxborn Creatures}, commonly magic resistance and magic weapons.": "他们是Nyxborn，拥有{@book chapter 6|MOT|6|Nyxborn Creatures}中描述的一到两个Nyxborn特征，通常是魔法抵抗和魔法武器。",
	"They're of remarkable size, being at least one size category larger than normal.": "它们的尺寸非常大，至少比正常的尺寸大一个类别。",
	"As the simplest form of miracle, a god can produce the effect of any cleric spell or any spell associated with one of the god's domains, and have the spell take effect anywhere in the mortal realm. The gods' capabilities aren't limited by spell lists, though, and their miraculous intervention can have any effect you want. Direct godly intervention tends to be subtle and rare, though, as it attracts the attention of other gods and might encourage them to meddle in their own ways.": "作为最简单的奇迹形式，神可以产生任何牧师法术或与神的领域之一相关的任何法术的效果，并让法术在凡人界的任何地方生效。不过，神的能力不受法术清单的限制，他们的奇迹干预可以产生你想要的任何效果。不过，直接的神力干预往往是微妙而罕见的，因为它吸引了其他神的注意，并可能鼓励他们以自己的方式进行干预。",
	"Life as a champion of a god offers abundant opportunities to escape life's tedium, but a mortal who wants to truly take control of fate can request an ordeal from one of the gods. An ordeal, as the name indicates, is no easy task. To receive one, a candidate must accomplish at least one near-impossible feat to even make the request: finding a pathway into Nyx. But the reward for triumph is appropriate to the scale of the challenge.": "作为一个神的拥护者，生活提供了大量的机会来逃避生活的乏味，但一个想真正控制命运的凡人可以向一个神要求进行折磨。仪式，顾名思义，并不是一件容易的事。要得到一个，候选人必须至少完成一个近乎不可能的壮举，才能提出请求：找到一个进入尼克斯的通道。但胜利的奖励与挑战的规模是相称的。",
	"The first stage of a divine ordeal is entering Nyx. Callaphe the mariner is said to have sailed her ship over the waterfall at the edge of the world and right into Nyx, where she can still be seen among the constellations. Additionally, Kruphix's Temple of Mystery at the edge of the world and the shrine of Nykthos are known to hold portals that lead to the gates of Nyx.": "神圣磨难的第一阶段是进入尼克斯。据说水手卡拉佩（Callaphe）将她的船驶过世界边缘的瀑布，直接进入尼克斯，在那里仍然可以看到她在星座中。此外，位于世界边缘的克鲁普希克斯的神秘神庙和奈克索斯的神殿也被认为拥有通往尼克斯之门的门户。",
	"In theory, high-level characters can use spells such as {@spell plane shift} or {@spell gate} to move from the mortal realm to Nyx. In practice, securing the proper material component to travel to Nyx through the {@spell plane shift} spell is roughly as difficult as sailing to the edge of the world, and Kruphix can (and usually does) prevent the {@spell gate} spell from opening a portal into Nyx.": "理论上，高级角色可以使用{@spell plane shift}或{@spell gate}这样的法术从凡人界移动到Nyx。在实践中，通过{@spell plane shift}法术获得适当的物质成分以前往Nyx的难度与航行到世界的边缘差不多，而且Kruphix可以（通常也会）阻止{@spell gate}法术打开进入Nyx的门户。",
	"There might be other ways to get into Nyx, and each one is a challenge suited for the greatest heroes.": "可能还有其他进入Nyx的方法，而每一种方法都是适合最伟大的英雄的挑战。",
	"After reaching Nyx, a hero must next ask a god for an ordeal. Asking for an ordeal is as simple as calling out one's intention to the god: \"Erebos, I request an ordeal!\"": "在到达尼克斯之后，英雄必须向一个神明要求进行考验。向神明请求折磨就像向神明呼唤自己的意图一样简单：\"埃雷伯斯，我请求折磨！\"",
	"The gods grant ordeals only to those they consider worthy. The hero need not be a worshiper of the god being beseeched, or be concerned with upholding the god's ideals. As a rule, any hero capable of reaching Nyx is worthy of receiving an ordeal in most gods' eyes. Additionally, a god will typically only grant a champion one ordeal in their lifetime—allowing more only under exceptional circumstances.": "众神只对他们认为有价值的人给予折磨。英雄不需要是被祈求的神的崇拜者，也不需要关心维护神的理想。作为一项规则，在大多数神的眼中，任何能够到达尼克斯的英雄都值得接受神的折磨。此外，一个神在其一生中通常只会给予一个冠军一个折磨--只有在特殊情况下才会允许更多。",
	"A god might test multiple members of a group, confronting each with their own ordeals. Alternatively, champions devoted to different deities might all request ordeals from their own gods. Those who don't participate in an ordeal, though, still have plenty to do in Nyx and might find themselves contacted by agents of the gods or that realm's other legendary inhabitants.": "一个神可能会测试一个团体的多个成员，让他们各自面对自己的折磨。另外，献身于不同神灵的冠军可能都会向他们自己的神灵请求折磨。不过，那些不参加考验的人在尼克斯仍有很多事情要做，并可能发现自己被诸神的代理人或该领域的其他传奇居民联系。",
	"Assuming the god deems the hero worthy, the ordeal gets under way. The hero falls into a trance and steps alone into a dreamscape constructed by the god.": "假设神认为英雄是值得的，考验就开始了。英雄陷入恍惚之中，独自进入神所构建的梦境。",
	"An ordeal is a single encounter, which might involve combat, interaction, a series of ability checks, or other activities. It takes place in a dream state, so it's not essential that you give this encounter anything more than a narrative framing. The point is that the ordeal should test whether the hero's drive can counteract their other personality traits. The god who grants an ordeal shapes it. Keranos, for example, might challenge a hero with saving innocents during a dangerous storm, or Thassa might throw a mortal into a dreamscape where their ship is attacked by a kraken. Beyond the obvious challenge, the ordeal should create tension between a character's heroic drive and their other characteristics.": "一个磨难是一个单一的遭遇，可能涉及战斗、互动、一系列的能力检查或其他活动。它发生在梦境中，所以除了叙述性的框架外，你并没有必要给这个遭遇更多的东西。重点是，这个磨难应该测试英雄的驱动力是否能抵消他们的其他人格特征。赋予磨难的神灵决定了它。例如，凯拉诺斯（Keranos）可能会要求英雄在危险的风暴中拯救无辜者，或者塔萨（Thassa）可能会把一个凡人扔进他们的船被克拉肯袭击的梦境中。除了显而易见的挑战之外，磨难应该在角色的英雄主义动力和他们的其他特征之间创造紧张关系。",
	"You can use these guidelines to determine the appropriate degree of challenge for elements of an ordeal:": "你可以使用这些准则来确定一个磨难的要素的适当挑战程度。",
	"Use a monster or an NPC with a challenge rating equal to half the character's level.": "使用一个怪物或NPC，其挑战等级等于角色等级的一半。",
	"Use {@dice 2d4} creatures, each of which has a challenge rating of about one-fifth the character's level.": "使用{@dice 2d4}生物，每个生物的挑战等级约为角色等级的五分之一。",
	"Set the DC at 20 for most checks and 25 for checks that are crucial to the ordeal.": "大多数检查的DC为20，对折磨人的关键检查为25。",
	"There's typically no penalty for failing an ordeal, but the reward for success can be great. A character can request anything from a god. Consider these examples of what a god might grant to a successful hero:": "通常情况下，失败的折磨没有惩罚，但成功的奖励可能是巨大的。一个角色可以向神灵提出任何要求。考虑一下神可能给予成功的英雄的这些例子。",

As the story progresses, the Returned and eidolons might feature more prominently, along with situations that force champions to oppose those seeking the souls of loved ones or the spirits of those with work left undone. At some point, Athreos's champions might come to oppose the arrogance and treachery of Erebos, Heliod, and Phenax, or the machinations of demons or the necropoleis of the Returned.": "在战役的早期，阿瑟罗斯的冠军们可能会面对危险的或不听话的亡灵，比如食尸鬼和幽灵，或者在神圣的埋葬地点居住的怪物。随着故事的发展，回归者和Eidolons可能会更加突出，还有迫使冠军们反对那些寻求亲人灵魂或工作未完成者的精神的情况。在某些时候，Athreos的冠军们可能会反对Erebos、Heliod和Phenax的傲慢和背叛，或者反对恶魔的阴谋或回归者的亡灵。",
	"The River Guide's mortal servants will likely find their emotions tested—particularly their sense of morality and their inclination toward sympathy. Any mortal might be moved to restore a ruler whose death will ignite a war or by the plight of lovers separated by death.

As a result, Athreos's followers make grim opponents when they prioritize the needs of the dead over the living. Their mission also makes them ready foes of the Returned and their allies. Some seek to achieve greater efficiency in the transition of the doomed into death, such as by impeding medical treatment or wrecking warships destined for hopeless wars. Athreos doesn't approve of utter cruelty, but neither does he particularly care, so long as the dead meet him with coin.": "Athreos的冠军们很容易放弃他们与其他凡人的联系。在无尽的死亡和悲伤的人群中工作可以消磨人的同情心，并使任何灵魂变得坚硬。因此，当阿瑟雷斯的追随者将死者的需求置于活人之上时，他们会成为残酷的对手。他们的使命也使他们成为回归者及其盟友的敌人。有些人寻求在将注定死亡的人过渡到死亡的过程中实现更高的效率，例如通过阻碍医疗或破坏注定无望的战争的战舰。阿瑟雷斯并不赞成完全的残忍，但他也不特别在意，只要死人用硬币来迎接他。",

	"Athreos sees his responsibilities as necessary, but doesn't cherish them. Were there a more efficient way to maintain the cycle of life and death, or to create some sort of stasis, he might pursue it. Alternatively, wittingly or otherwise, Athreos might allow some less reliable being to take over his labors. Regardless of the circumstances, any change in the River Guide's role would have dramatic effects on the living and the balance of power between Theros's immortals. Adventurers caught in Athreos's machinations have the potential to influence nothing less than the underpinnings of existence.": "Athreos认为他的责任是必要的，但并不珍惜它们。如果有更有效的方法来维持生与死的循环，或者创造某种停滞，他可能会去追求。另外，不管是有意还是无意，阿瑟雷斯可能会让一些不太可靠的生命来接管他的工作。无论在什么情况下，导河者角色的任何改变都会对活着的人和Theros的不朽者之间的力量平衡产生巨大的影响。陷入阿斯琉斯的阴谋的冒险者有可能影响到存在的基础。",
	"Correcting any imbalance in the cycle of life and death likely involves the assistance of other gods. If Athreos ever truly abandons his duties, it might be necessary for another to take up his labors.

	"The Tartyx River is dotted with ruined temples of Athreos on either side of its banks that serve as crossing points between the mortal world and the Underworld.

	"Alternatively, it might be souls rather than riches that tempt adventurers to the Tartyx's banks. A spirit who died without payment for Athreos might linger at the river's edge. Perhaps adventurers seek to help such a lost soul pass on to the Underworld, or they might offer to pay for passage if a spirit shares valuable information with them. In either case, adventurers might offer the dead help in reaching their final resting place.": "另外，诱惑冒险家们来到塔提克斯河畔的可能是灵魂而不是财富。一个没有为阿瑟雷斯付出就死去的灵魂可能会在河边徘徊。也许冒险者会寻求帮助这样一个迷失的灵魂前往冥界，或者如果一个灵魂与他们分享有价值的信息，他们可能会提供通行费。无论是哪种情况，冒险者都可以为死者提供帮助，让他们到达最后的安息之地。",

	"A game focused on establishment might see the characters founding a new city, or perhaps reviving a dead one. One focused on development could go beyond the basics of what a city needs to survive and get into what a city requires to thrive—which could easily lead to campaigns less focused on combat and more on social encounters and intrigue. Lastly, a campaign focused on defending a city could present a range of threats, from external foes—like wild creatures or invading armies—to internal enemies—like corrupt leaders or dangerous criminals. In any of these cases, Ephara cares about protecting cities from the poison of corruption and tyranny as well as threats from armies or the wild.": "一个专注于建立的游戏可能会看到角色们建立一个新的城市，或者是恢复一个已经死亡的城市。侧重于发展的游戏可以超越一个城市生存所需的基本要素，而进入一个城市繁荣所需的要素--这很容易导致不注重战斗而更注重社会接触和阴谋的活动。最后，一个专注于保卫城市的战役可能会出现一系列的威胁，从外部敌人--野生生物或入侵的军队--到内部敌人--腐败的领导人或危险的罪犯。在任何情况下，埃法拉都关心保护城市免受腐败和暴政的毒害，以及来自军队或野外的威胁。",

	"Ephara isn't often associated with monsters. Even so, a few monsters common in urban settings might be involved with the deity or her worshipers. Since many of Ephara's most devout followers are scholars, they commonly use magically constructed creatures in their plans. The vast majority of villains associated with Ephara are humans: soldiers, politicians, priests, and scholars who believe that Ephara's vision of a proper city is more important than the people living in it. The Ephara's Monsters table presents just a few foes likely to serve the god's will.": "艾法拉并不经常与怪物联系在一起。即便如此，城市环境中常见的一些怪物也可能与神灵或她的崇拜者有关。由于许多埃法拉最虔诚的追随者是学者，他们通常在计划中使用魔法构造的生物。绝大多数与埃法拉有关的恶棍都是人类：士兵、政客、牧师和学者，他们认为埃法拉对一个合适的城市的看法比生活在其中的人更重要。埃法拉的怪兽表只介绍了几个可能为神的意志服务的敌人。",
	"A campaign with Ephara as the villain might be well suited to a wilderness-based campaign. Many people of the wilds see the patron of cities as inherently villainous—a colonialist monster who crushes the wilderness in the name of supposed civilization. For player characters who are affiliated with the wilderness or who worship Nylea, Ephara makes an obvious antagonist.": "以Ephara为反派的活动可能很适合以荒野为基础的活动。许多荒野的人认为城市的守护者本质上是个坏蛋--以所谓文明的名义粉碎荒野的殖民主义怪物。对于那些隶属于荒野或崇拜Nylea的玩家角色来说，Ephara是一个明显的反面人物。",
	"A likely storyline with Ephara as the main villain would involve the characters trying to stop champions of Ephara from establishing a new city or expanding an existing city into the wilderness, displacing the people and creatures that inhabit the area. This wilderness could be where the characters live, or the residents of the area might ask the characters for help. Since the followers of Ephara see cities as inherently superior to other locations, they are unmoved by simple pleas to leave the wilderness as it is, and the characters likely must stop them by force.": "一个以Ephara为主要反派的可能的故事情节将涉及到人物试图阻止Ephara的拥护者建立一个新的城市或将现有的城市扩展到荒野，取代居住在该地区的人和生物。这个荒野可能是人物居住的地方，或者该地区的居民可能向人物寻求帮助。由于Ephara的追随者认为城市天生就比其他地方优越，所以他们对离开荒野的简单请求不为所动，人物很可能必须用武力阻止他们。",

	"A campaign structured around the player characters as champions of Erebos often invites a certain amount of moral complexity. Perhaps heroes are brought together to oppose an overreach by a champion of Heliod. Or maybe they're united by some common plight such as plague or war, as Erebos grants his blessings to those who determinedly face fate. From there, they might be drawn into helping Erebos maintain the line between life and death by fighting against Returned raiders.": "围绕玩家角色作为Erebos的拥护者而展开的战役往往会带来一定程度的道德复杂性。也许英雄们被聚集在一起，反对赫利奥德冠军的过度行为。或者他们因为一些共同的困境而团结起来，比如瘟疫或战争，因为埃雷伯斯将他的祝福赐予那些坚定地面对命运的人。从那里，他们可能会被吸引到帮助Erebos维持生与死之间的界限，与回归者的袭击者战斗。",
	"Champions of Erebos who want to maintain a moral code separate from that of their god have a difficult path to walk. They might find themselves forced to choose between what they believe is right and what their god tells them to do.

The characters might then try to atone for their behavior or seek the protection of another god.": "想保持与他们的神分开的道德准则的埃雷伯斯的拥护者有一条困难的路要走。他们可能会发现自己被迫在他们认为正确的事情和他们的神告诉他们要做的事情之间做出选择。如果这导致他们违反了Erebos最神圣的规则之一--例如，允许一个迷失的灵魂逃脱--Erebos可能会转变为一个竞选中的反派。然后，人物可能会试图为他们的行为赎罪，或寻求另一个神的保护。",
	"Erebos's sphere of influence is every bit as essential to life on Theros as Heliod's, but it is easy to see why many take a dim view of him and his champions.

The campaign might begin with cultists of Erebos committing random murders, then escalate when a prominent priest or champion of Heliod is assassinated. Adventurers who have no love for the sun god might still find cause to put a stop to Erebos's terrors—particularly if he starts lashing out against followers of other gods.": "作为活动中的反派，Erebos将试图实施他最坏的计划：播种绝望，在他们的时间之前结束生命，或者取代Heliod。活动开始时，Erebos的崇拜者可能会随意杀人，然后在Heliod的著名牧师或冠军被暗杀时升级。对太阳神没有爱的冒险者可能仍然有理由阻止埃雷伯斯的恐怖--特别是如果他开始对其他神的追随者发难。",

	"Any place where the remains of the dead are interred is considered a place of worship for Erebos.

	"During the day, the priests lead funeral rites, care for the graveyard, and offer counsel to those praying for acceptance of their fates.

From there, it's a small step to suppressing the open worship of other gods, then trying to spread both policies to other cities. If the characters are champions of other gods, they might find themselves the targets of Heliod's agents, marked as a threat to order and stability in the poleis.": "作为一个战役中的反派，赫利奥德最有可能被他的欲望所驱使，他要宣称自己对万神殿其他神灵的统治权和对一切的王权：尼克斯、凡人世界和冥界。他可能会通过他的代理人开始制定法律，使一个城市的公民必须参加赫利奥德的仪式。从那里开始，压制对其他神的公开崇拜只是一小步，然后试图将这两项政策推广到其他城市。如果人物是其他神的拥护者，他们可能会发现自己成为赫利奥德的代理人的目标，被标记为对波利斯的秩序和稳定的威胁。",

	"Iroas's champions are his generals, through whom he can deliver death blows to his enemies. On a daily basis, Iroas serves the causes of justice and honor.

Iroas is a god of action, and his champions are the tip of his spear, expected to hurl themselves at danger when it presents itself. Iroas holds a bitter grudge against his brother Mogis, and Iroas's champions often counter the agents of the god of carnage.": "以伊洛亚斯的冠军为中心的战役充满了战斗，令人惊叹的英雄主义行为，以及面对巨大困难的英勇姿态。伊洛亚斯是一位行动之神，他的冠军们是他的矛尖，当危险出现时，他们会奋不顾身。伊洛亚斯对他的兄弟莫吉斯怀有深仇大恨，而伊洛亚斯的冠军们经常反击大屠杀之神的代理人。",
	"As the campaign begins, the characters could find themselves on a field of battle, either as mercenaries or sworn soldiers for a polis. Their courage at arms and the honor they demonstrate in battle impress Iroas, and he proudly bestows his blessing on them. Every subsequent engagement only enhances the characters' reputation as skilled, steadfast warriors without peer. Their actions inevitably lead to a challenge from a champion of Mogis who is intent on destroying the characters and anyone they hold dear.": "随着战役的开始，角色们可能会发现自己在战场上，要么是雇佣兵，要么是一个政体的宣誓士兵。他们在战斗中表现出的勇气和荣誉感给伊洛亚斯留下了深刻的印象，他自豪地对他们给予了祝福。随后的每一次交战都会提高这些人物的声誉，使他们成为技术精湛、坚定不移的战士。他们的行动不可避免地导致了来自莫吉斯冠军的挑战，他打算摧毁这些人物和他们所珍视的任何人。",

	"Myth of Kelephne the Victor": "胜利者凯莱夫尼的神话",

As the games commenced, the rumors continued, and athletic victories seemed hollow so long as the so-called best was not there to compete.": "它始于一个传言。聚集在阿克罗斯参加伊洛恩运动会的运动员们低声议论着荒野中的一个隐士，一个徒手打倒巨人的摔跤高手。随着比赛的开始，谣言不断，只要所谓的高手不在现场，运动的胜利就显得很空洞。",
	"When Kelephne did arrive, she was barefoot and had a fire in her eyes. The rumors of her skill were not exaggerated, and for three days, she battled a continuous stream of competitors. When no others would challenge her, she left without ceremony. She was never seen again, and some speculated she was Iroas in human form.": "当Kelephne真的到达时，她赤着脚，眼中充满了火焰。关于她的技能的传言并没有夸大，三天来，她与源源不断的竞争者交战。当没有人愿意向她挑战时，她毫不客气地离开了。她再也没有出现过，有人猜测她是人形的伊罗亚斯。",

These instructions became known as Kelephne's manual, and her technique was called pankration—now a widely studied style of weaponless fighting.": "运动员们多年来一直试图模仿Kelephne的技术。多年后，流浪者发现了一个写满文字的山洞。这些说明被称为Kelephne的手册，而她的技术被称为pankration--现在是一种被广泛研究的无武器战斗风格。",
	"Iroas, for all his love of justice and honor, is still a god of war. Anyone on the opposing side of Iroas's forces can expect to face motivated, dedicated warriors. He is also quite stubborn and takes losing a challenge personally, sometimes declaring a vendetta if he believes the challenge was won dishonorably.": "伊洛亚斯，尽管他热爱正义和荣誉，但仍然是一个战争之神。任何站在伊鲁阿斯部队对立面的人都可以期待面对积极的、专注的战士。他也相当顽固，对挑战失败耿耿于怀，如果他认为挑战是不光彩地赢得的，有时会宣布仇杀。",
	"Iroas's followers sometimes forsake mercy and compassion, as matters of honor and victory are uppermost, making them pitiless foes. Writ small, this behavior could show up in an overzealous young commander who would sacrifice his unit in a hopeless battle rather than retreat. If a great champion of Iroas loses their moral compass amid the horrors of war and commits atrocities in the name of victory, Iroas himself will send heroes to stop the fallen champion.": "伊洛亚斯的追随者有时会放弃仁慈和同情心，因为荣誉和胜利是最重要的，这使他们成为无情的敌人。从小处说，这种行为可能表现在一个过度热心的年轻指挥官身上，他宁可在一场无望的战斗中牺牲自己的部队也不愿意撤退。如果一个伟大的伊鲁亚斯冠军在战争的恐怖中失去了他们的道德指南针，并以胜利的名义犯下暴行，伊鲁亚斯本人会派英雄来阻止这个堕落的冠军。",

	"Iroas might be titled the god of victory in all respects, but he cares less about victory in competitions than he does about victory in war. In war, both mortals and gods could be blinded by the rush to victory or by cleaving to stubbornly held ideas. Although a campaign against Iroas might be straightforward in how the action plays out, the underlying causes of conflict could be quite complex, involving attacks on people who may seem unrelated to the initial conflict. As a campaign villain, Iroas is most likely driven by his desire to win in battle, to confront Mogis, or to avenge an insult to his honor.": "伊洛亚斯可能在各方面都被冠以胜利之神的称号，但他对比赛胜利的关心程度不如对战争胜利的关心程度。在战争中，凡人和众神都可能被急于求成的心态蒙蔽，或被劈头盖脸的顽固观念所迷惑。尽管针对伊洛亚斯的战役在行动方式上可能很直接，但冲突的根本原因可能相当复杂，涉及对那些看起来与最初的冲突无关的人的攻击。作为一个战役中的反派，伊洛亚斯很可能是被他在战斗中获胜的欲望所驱使，与莫吉斯对抗，或为他的荣誉受到的侮辱复仇。",

	"Iroas isn't much of a schemer. His view of the world is through the crystal-clear lens of battle—strategic and tactical plans are unambiguous and executed with precision.

She no longer demands blood sacrifices from her worshipers because they no longer believe such supplication is necessary—not because she decided to stop. In the pantheon, she personifies a truth that most gods don't fully appreciate but do fear: for all the influence they might have over mortal lives, the collective force of mortal belief can reshape the gods' very nature.": "自然界固有的野性是卡拉米特拉存在的一部分。把卡拉米特拉描绘成一个反派的活动可能会探索她内心深处的凶残，这种狂野的一面被凡人的信仰力量所抑制，而凡人的信仰则把她描绘成一个温柔的、母性的赏赐之源。她不再要求她的崇拜者提供血祭，因为他们不再相信这种祈求是必要的，而不是因为她决定停止。在万神殿中，她代表了一个大多数神灵不完全了解但却害怕的事实：尽管他们可能对凡人的生活有影响，但凡人信仰的集体力量可以重塑神灵的本质。",

She creates new plant species that feed on mortals, while her followers act oddly, running off to join bloody revels or sacrificing each other in the fields. How many must die before balance is restored?": "卡拉米特拉认为凡人已经生产过剩，于是采取行动清除人口。她创造了新的植物物种，以凡人为食，而她的追随者则表现得很奇怪，跑去参加血腥的狂欢，或者在田野里互相献祭。在恢复平衡之前，到底要死多少人？",

	"Sites that are sacred to Karametra, from her grand temple in the heart of Setessa to outposts in the wilderness, combine careful construction with natural growth.

	"It is relatively easy for a mortal to lose Keranos's favor because the god is quick to anger and doesn't suffer failure or foolishness well. Should the characters disappoint the god, they might have to assuage Keranos's wrath. They could accomplish this through a great feat of wit, by laying low a powerful foe, by embarrassing a rival god, or by discovering a great insight or secret. Until this is done, Keranos would be a potent adversary.": "对凡人来说，失去Keranos的青睐是比较容易的，因为这位神灵很快就会发怒，而且不善于忍受失败或愚蠢。如果人物让神明失望，他们可能不得不平息Keranos的怒火。他们可以通过一个伟大的智慧壮举，通过压制一个强大的敌人，通过让对手的神尴尬，或者通过发现一个伟大的洞察力或秘密来实现这一目标。在做到这一点之前，Keranos将是一个强大的对手。",
	"Inspiration, unguided by morals and ethics, is a dangerous force, but Keranos isn't usually concerned with matters of good or evil. As such, a charismatic leader, acting on Keranos's divinely inspired intuition, could find themselves succumbing to megalomania and hubris, with disastrous consequences for a polis.": "没有道德和伦理的指导，灵感是一种危险的力量，但Keranos通常不关心善恶问题。因此，一个有魅力的领袖，根据Keranos的神圣灵感直觉行事，可能会发现自己屈服于自大狂和傲慢，对政体造成灾难性的后果。",

If you want to pit the characters against a morally gray antagonist who might have some traits or qualities that they admire, Keranos and his followers would work admirably.": "凯拉诺斯的追随者可能会变得过于狭隘地专注于完成危险的预言而不顾生命的损失。如果你想让人物对抗一个道德上灰暗的对手，而这个对手可能有一些他们所欣赏的特征或品质，那么凯拉诺斯和他的追随者会令人钦佩地发挥作用。",

	"Because Keranos doesn't readily concern himself with quandaries of good versus evil, it is easy to use him as a villain. The god might be driven by frustration at mortals over their lack of vision, or by a consuming need to trigger unrestrained creative impulses that have far-reaching effects, by anger at a real or perceived slight. His will might be expressed through an oracle who foretells a great tragedy that involves the characters or someone they care about. As the campaign progresses, Keranos becomes increasingly upset at the actions the characters take to thwart his insights or their defense of the status quo and sends his agents to enlighten them.": "由于凯拉诺斯并不轻易关注善与恶的窘境，因此很容易将他作为一个反派。这位神可能是因为对凡人缺乏远见而感到沮丧，或者因为对真实或感知到的轻视感到愤怒，需要引发无限制的创造冲动，从而产生深远的影响。他的意志可能通过一个预言家来表达，这个预言家预言了一个涉及人物或他们关心的人的大悲剧。随着活动的进行，Keranos对人物阻挠他的洞察力或他们对现状的维护所采取的行动越来越不满，并派他的代理人去启迪他们。",
	"The campaign might end with the adventurers unraveling a troublesome prophecy, proving themselves of sufficient wisdom to merit respect, or when they convince the other gods (especially Klothys) to intervene and check Keranos's wrath.": "活动结束时，冒险者可能会解开一个麻烦的预言，证明自己有足够的智慧值得尊重，或者当他们说服其他神灵（尤其是克洛特斯）进行干预并阻止凯拉诺斯的愤怒。",
	"Keranos doesn't interact much with the rest of the pantheon, preferring to brood and dispense epiphanies in solitude. He is, however, easily roused to anger and goes to extremes to satisfy real or perceived slights. The Keranos's Divine Schemes table explores the sorts of plots the god might pursue.": "凯拉诺斯与万神殿的其他成员互动不多，他更喜欢在孤独中沉思和发放顿悟。然而，他很容易被激怒，为了满足真实或感知到的轻视，他会走极端。凯拉诺斯的神性计划表探讨了该神可能追求的各种阴谋。",
	"Bored with the temporary beauty of violent weather, Keranos creates a massive, self-perpetuating storm. Over time, the storm grows out of control. Keranos is delighted by his creation.": "凯拉诺斯厌倦了暴力天气的暂时性美丽，创造了一个巨大的、自我延续的风暴。随着时间的推移，风暴逐渐失去了控制。凯拉诺斯为他的创造感到高兴。",
	"Dared by Phenax to prove that he can, Keranos inspires eight mortals with eight ingenious ways to destroy the world. As a result, a genius actor, alchemist, inventor, diver, miner, sculptor, thief, and a duplicitous goat all set forth to enact their terrible brilliance.": "凯拉诺斯为了证明自己的能力，激发了八个凡人，提出了八种毁灭世界的巧妙方法。结果，一个天才演员、炼金术士、发明家、潜水员、矿工、雕塑家、小偷和一只阴险的山羊都开始发挥他们可怕的聪明才智。",
	"Keranos finds the spread of mortal knowledge inconsistent and slow. He empowers a champion to grant vast knowledge to any person or beast she touches. The advent of sagacious cattle, wolves, and children greatly disrupts (and unnerves) those who live in the areas through which Keranos's champion travels.": "凯拉诺斯发现凡人的知识传播不连贯而且缓慢。他赋予一个冠军以巨大的知识，让她接触到的任何人或动物都能获得。聪明的牛、狼和儿童的出现极大地扰乱了那些生活在凯拉诺斯的冠军所经过的地区的人们（并使之感到不安）。",

	"A few of Keranos's most isolated temples serve a purpose beyond worship, being sites for the reading of worldly signs and recording of knowledge. These oracular confluxes provide followers of Keranos the tools to glean great truths, be they natural occurrences or omens of the gods. Because of Keranos's connection to storms and the heavens, such temples often have weather vanes, telescopes, and other tools used to predict the weather and chart the course of celestial bodies.": "凯拉诺斯最偏僻的几座寺庙的作用超越了崇拜，它们是阅读世俗迹象和记录知识的场所。这些神谕汇合处为凯拉诺斯的追随者提供了收集伟大真理的工具，无论是自然事件还是诸神的预兆。由于凯拉诺斯与风暴和天体的关系，这种寺庙通常有风向标、望远镜和其他用于预测天气和绘制天体路线的工具。",
	"Each shrine has multiple methods of predicting the future that it might offer visitors—with reading the stars, the clouds, or the entrails of sacrificed animals being particularly common.

In some communities, oracles actively strive to be struck by lightning, risking their lives to receive mighty messages from their god.": "每个神社都有多种预测未来的方法，它可能会向游客提供--读星、读云或读祭祀动物的内脏是特别常见的。最受欢迎的预言是在雷雨期间进行的。人群聚集在神庙里，观看神谕者根据降雨、风、雷和其他天气测量结果进行预测。在一些社区，神谕者积极争取被雷电击中，冒着生命危险从他们的神那里得到强有力的信息。",

	"Klothys rarely reveals her plans. The characters might begin the campaign by following a prophecy to a far-off land or interpreting infrequent omens to learn of nearby threats.

	"Most mortals know little of the titans, except the comforting fact that these ancient, gigantic terrors are bound far away in the Underworld—and are therefore nothing to worry about. The fact that Klothys, god of destiny, personally and actively holds them there is unknown to most. With her spindle, Klothys endlessly knots and unravels the strands of destiny, constantly tightening the trap that keeps the titans imprisoned. Were it not for her immortal vigilance, the titans might once again claim the mortal realm as their own.": "大多数凡人对泰坦族知之甚少，除了一个令人欣慰的事实，即这些古老而巨大的恐怖力量被束缚在遥远的冥界，因此没有什么可担心的。大多数人不知道命运之神克洛蒂斯亲自积极地把它们关在那里。Klothys用她的纺锤，无休止地打结和解开命运之线，不断收紧囚禁泰坦的陷阱。如果不是她不朽的警觉，泰坦巨人可能会再次将凡人的境界视为己有。",
	"Klothys emerged from the Underworld in order to restore the natural order on Theros, creating a number of Nyxborn agents to aid her. Virtually anyone could end up a target of the god or her agents if they stand in opposition to destiny.": "Klothys为了恢复特洛斯的自然秩序而从冥界出现，创造了一些Nyxborn代理人来帮助她。几乎任何人都可能成为神或她的代理人的目标，如果他们站在命运的对立面。",
	"Various monsters rose from the Underworld when Klothys entered the mortal realm, and her most zealous followers often see them as manifestations of her will. Some might goad these terrors into attacking communities, or foster them to further spread the god's will. Klothys's most callous followers might also believe that society must crumble for the world to heal. If Klothys didn't intend this, they reason, then surely she wouldn't have brought so many monsters along in her wake.": "当克洛蒂斯进入凡间时，各种怪物从冥界升起，而她最狂热的追随者往往将它们视为她意志的体现。有些人可能会诱使这些恐怖的东西攻击社区，或培养它们来进一步传播神的意志。Klothys最冷酷无情的追随者也可能认为，社会必须崩溃，世界才能愈合。他们的理由是，如果克洛蒂斯没有这个打算，那么她肯定不会在她的身后带来这么多怪物。",
	"The Klothys's Villains table suggests just a few foes that might arise from among the god's followers.": "Klothys的恶棍表显示，在神的追随者中可能出现的敌人只有几个。",

	"An {@creature oracle|MOT} (see {@book chapter 6|MOT|6|Oracle}) knows it is a character's destiny to serve Klothys. The seer manufactures tragedy for the individual to provoke this revelation.": "一个{@creature oracle|MOT}(见{@book chapter 6|MOT|6|Oracle})知道一个角色的命运是为Klothys服务。预言家为个人制造悲剧，以激起这种启示。",
	"A {@creature cult fanatic} of Klothys believes that the characters' deeds mark them as servants of the titans, destined to free one of those ancient terrors.": "一个{@creature cult fanatic}的Klothys认为，这些人物的行为标志着他们是泰坦的仆人，注定要解放那些古老的恐怖之一。",
	"A variety of monstrous creatures might arise in an area as a result of Klothys's influence, particularly those presented on the Klothys's Monsters table.": "由于Klothys的影响，一个地区可能会出现各种各样的怪物，特别是Klothys的怪物表上的那些怪物。",
	"As a foe, Klothys might endeavor to reestablish the order of the cosmos that existed before the meddling of Xenagos and Heliod. These corrections start small, manifesting as fires, monster infestations, or a spate of accidental deaths. The more the characters intervene, the more dire these events become as the god's servants overcorrect to account for the heroes' meddling. Alternatively, averting one disaster might naturally lead to a greater one, at which point characters must contend not only with the latest catastrophe but also with the accusations and assaults of Klothys's tireless followers.": "作为一个敌人，Klothys可能会努力重建在Xenagos和Heliod插手之前存在的宇宙秩序。这些修正开始时很小，表现为火灾、怪物出没或一连串的意外死亡。角色干预得越多，这些事件就变得越可怕，因为神的仆人们为了解释英雄们的干预而进行了过度修正。另外，避免一场灾难可能会自然而然地导致一场更大的灾难，这时人物不仅要与最新的灾难抗争，还要与Klothys不知疲倦的追随者的指责和攻击抗争。",
	"Ultimately, Klothys holds grudges only rarely. The campaign might conclude when the characters identify the moment they strayed from their destined place and correct things in order to appease the god. Likewise, the heroes might invoke the other gods' support to deflect Klothys's wrath. Boldest of all, the characters might determine what device allowed the god to enter the mortal realm; its destruction could hurl Klothys back into the Underworld for untold ages to come.": "归根结底，克洛蒂斯只是很少记仇。当角色们发现他们偏离了预定的位置并纠正了事情以安抚神灵时，活动就可能结束了。同样，英雄们可能会援引其他神灵的支持来转移Klothys的怒火。最大胆的是，人物可能会确定是什么装置让神进入了凡间；它的破坏可能会把Klothys扔回冥界，让他在未来数不清的岁月里逍遥。",
	"Klothys has many designs for Theros and for the futures she has foretold that might never come to pass. The Klothys's Divine Schemes table provides several ways in which her foresight and fury might ensnare adventurers.": "Klothys对Theros和她所预言的未来有许多设计，但可能永远不会实现。Klothys的神圣计划表提供了几种她的预知和愤怒可能会诱使冒险者的方式。",
	"Convinced that Heliod's boundless ambition will destroy Theros, Klothys creates an artifact that will destroy the sun god once he claims it as his own. She needs mortal heroes who can demonstrate the artifact's power by vanquishing Erebos's servants, and in the process stoke Heliod's envy.": "Klothys确信Heliod的无尽野心将摧毁Theros，因此创造了一件神器，一旦太阳神将其据为己有，就能摧毁它。她需要一些凡人英雄，他们可以通过征服Erebos的仆人来展示神器的力量，并在这个过程中激起Heliod的嫉妒。",
	"Concerned by the spread of Meletian influence, Klothys fills the dreams of the polis's people with treachery. Neighbors attack neighbors, and attempts by Ephara's followers to intervene only redirect the violence toward the polis's patron.": "由于担心弥勒教的影响蔓延，克洛提斯在波利斯人民的梦中充满了背叛。邻居们攻击邻居，而埃法拉的追随者们试图进行干预，却只能将暴力转向政体的保护者。",
	"Klothys becomes convinced that mortals giving worship to the gods distorts their proper relationship to each other, and she sets out to abolish religion.": "Klothys确信，凡人对神灵的崇拜扭曲了他们之间应有的关系，因此她着手废除宗教。",
	"Now that she has left the Underworld, Klothys knows it's only a matter of time until the titans escape. To prepare the world for the horrors of that inevitable conflict, she unleashes Underworld beasts into the mortal realm, trusting that the mayhem will bring forth heroes who can ultimately defeat the titans.": "现在她已经离开了冥界，Klothys知道泰坦巨人逃跑只是时间问题。为了让世界对这一不可避免的冲突的恐怖做好准备，她将冥界的野兽释放到凡间，相信这种混乱会带来最终能打败泰坦的英雄。",
	"Abandoned temples can be found across Theros. Some of these places were once houses of worship of Klothys, the nearly forgotten god of destiny, but abandoned temples of many other gods also exist as the result of war, monster attacks, natural disasters, mass migration, neglect, or the wrath of deities.": "被遗弃的神庙在整个塞洛斯都可以找到。其中一些地方曾经是克洛蒂斯（Klothys）的崇拜场所，这位几乎被遗忘的命运之神，但许多其他神的废弃神庙也因战争、怪物袭击、自然灾害、大规模移民、忽视或神灵的愤怒而存在。",

You can use the Abandoned Temple Condition table to determine an abandoned temple's present state.": "每座废弃的神庙都是与众不同的，它结合了其守护神的各个方面和导致其被废弃的结果或影响。你可以使用废弃的寺庙状况表来确定一个废弃的寺庙的现状。",

To pass beyond the waterfall anywhere else is to tumble into the Underworld.": "传说中，克鲁普希克斯最神圣的神秘神庙矗立在世界的边缘。在克鲁普希克斯之树的支配下，神庙俯瞰着尼克斯本身，经过标志着凡人界边缘的巨大瀑布而突起。这个地方的确切位置在任何地图上都找不到，但传说它是特洛斯上少数几个凡人可以直接进入尼克斯的地方之一。在其他地方越过瀑布，就会跌入冥界。",
	"Kruphix doesn't often act in the world, but when he does, his agenda is often morally ambiguous, and his servants' sacred quests can look like villainous schemes from other points of view. Kruphix often leaves his instructions open to interpretation, and not all of his agents use this considerable latitude responsibly.": "Kruphix并不经常在这个世界上行动，但当他行动时，他的议程往往在道德上是模糊的，他的仆人们的神圣任务从其他角度看可能会像反派计划。克鲁普希克斯经常对他的指令进行解释，而且并非所有他的代理人都能负责任地使用这一相当大的自由度。",

	"The campaign might begin with the misbehavior of another god or gods, then escalate when Kruphix delivers a punishment that seems out of proportion to the crime. Further attempts by the other gods to circumvent or reverse the punishment could be countered by more edicts from Kruphix, perhaps even culminating in another great Silence.": "这场运动可能从另一个或多个神的不当行为开始，然后在克鲁普希克斯发出似乎与罪行不相称的惩罚时升级。其他神明试图规避或扭转惩罚的进一步努力可能会被克鲁普希斯的更多法令所反击，甚至可能在另一场大沉默中达到高潮。",
	"Just as Kruphix reins in the worst excesses of the other gods, the best chance of foiling Kruphix as a villain lies in the nature of Kruphix himself. A campaign in which Kruphix is a villain might end with the adventurers convincing him that his current actions don't serve the balance among the gods. Kruphix's mind isn't easily changed, though, and the adventurers might need to produce extraordinary testimony or evidence. Even just reaching Kruphix in order to communicate with him could easily require the patronage of other gods.": "就像克鲁普希斯控制着其他神的最恶劣的过度行为一样，挫败克鲁普希斯作为一个反派的最好机会在于克鲁普希斯本身的性质。一个以克鲁普希克斯为反派的活动可能会以冒险者说服他目前的行为不利于诸神之间的平衡而结束。不过，克鲁普希克斯的想法并不容易改变，冒险者可能需要提供非凡的证词或证据。即使只是为了与克鲁普希克斯沟通，也很容易需要其他神明的赞助。",
	"Kruphix wants to maintain the status quo rather than overturn it, so his schemes often begin as reactions to the activities of another god.

	"There are many paths to villainy in the name of Purphoros. The quest for ever finer works of craft can give rise to deadly rivalries. Resistance to lawful authority can become tyranny of another sort. And when passions become inflamed, giving in to them can lead to tragedy rather than triumph.

	"As a campaign villain, Purphoros is more likely to be driven by his impulses rather than by any coherent plan.

Assuming the player characters are champions of other gods, they might well find themselves the targets of Purphoros's rage.": "作为一个战役中的反派，珀弗洛斯更可能被他的冲动所驱使，而不是由任何连贯的计划所驱动。他可能一开始就鼓励他的拥护者创作作品并传播贬低其他神明的故事。当其他神灵对他所选择的神灵进行报复时，Purphoros会做出愤怒的反应，对整个Theros的其他神灵的庙宇和祭司进行报复。假设玩家角色是其他神灵的拥护者，他们很可能发现自己是珀弗洛斯愤怒的目标。",

	"The grandest temples of Purphoros burrow into the hearts of active volcanoes, being both places of worship and workshops. The volcanic vapors inspire artisans who worship at the top of the temple, then journey down to glowing forges where they craft armor, jewelry, weapons, and other works of art. The forges in a volcano temple get so hot they can work almost any material, mundane or extraordinary. The faithful of Purphoros often work on commission or sell their works, though some create strictly for themselves.": "珀尔福罗斯最宏伟的寺庙钻进了活火山的心脏，既是崇拜的地方，也是工场。火山蒸汽激发了工匠们的灵感，他们在寺庙的顶部进行礼拜，然后下到发光的锻造厂，在那里他们制作盔甲、珠宝、武器和其他艺术品。火山神庙中的锻造炉温度很高，几乎可以加工任何材料，无论是普通的还是特殊的。珀弗罗斯的信徒们经常受委托工作或出售他们的作品，尽管有些人严格为自己创作。",
	"Just like the treasures forged inside them, volcanic temples are works of art. The priests who maintain the structures carve intricate designs with metal filigree in the stone walls and craft ornamental decorations that make each temple look more like an art museum than a cave inside a mountain.

	"An adventure in a volcano temple incorporates the danger of fire, the power of divine magic, and the allure of art and treasure. It is easy to get lost in the temple's twisting, never-finished halls, minor eruptions pose a constant threat, and former temples ruined by eruptions now connect to dark places that monsters call home. Despite these hazards, the valuables most temples hold can be too tempting for some adventurers to pass up.

	"Sometimes the answer to a riddle is lost beyond the inky waters of the Tartyx River. When spells and sages fail to recover some crucial bit of information, how far might heroes go to recover it? One answer is to dare an expedition into the Underworld to find what was lost. Entering the Underworld is arguably one of the easiest feats imaginable—everyone ends up there when they die. Entering while still alive, and in such a way as to be able to walk out again, is another matter entirely.": "有时，谜题的答案会遗失在塔提克斯河的墨色水域之外。当法术和圣人都无法找回一些关键的信息时，英雄们会走多远来找回它呢？一个答案是敢于进入冥界寻找丢失的东西。进入冥界可以说是最容易的壮举之一--每个人死后都会到那里。在活着的时候进入，并且能够再次走出去，则完全是另一回事。",
	"Legends tell of places where the boundary between the mortal world and the Underworld is weak. These paths lie beyond lands controlled by the poleis and other civilized beings. Dark caves with tunnels leading down into darkness and rivers quietly lapping at fog-shrouded gravel shores give way to the Underworld's borders. Though Athreos ferries the dead across the Tartyx, he's not above accepting a one-way fare from those who still breathe. Even the other fearsome Underworld guardians that keep watch over the dead often allow the living to enter. Leaving the Underworld isn't so simple, and once beyond the Tartyx River the living find themselves in the same predicament as the dead. Within the Underworld, characters who entered bodily are still fully alive. They age, suffer damage, heal naturally, and require air, food, drink, and sleep as normal. The Underworld isn't conducive to mortal life, though, and between deadly creatures and dangerous otherworldly environments, the living might soon find themselves numbering among the dead.": "传说中，凡人世界和冥界之间的界限很薄弱。这些道路位于波利斯人和其他文明人控制的土地之外。黑暗的山洞里有通往黑暗的隧道，河流静静地拍打着被雾气笼罩的砾石海岸，给冥界的边界让路。虽然阿斯琉斯将死人渡过塔提克斯，但他并不排斥接受那些仍在呼吸的人的单程票。即使是其他可怕的冥界守护者，也经常允许活人进入。离开冥界并不那么简单，一旦过了塔提克斯河，活人就会发现自己处于和死人一样的困境。在冥界中，身体进入的角色仍然是完全活着的。他们会变老，遭受伤害，自然痊愈，并且像正常人一样需要空气、食物、饮料和睡眠。不过，冥界并不利于凡人的生活，在致命的生物和危险的另一个世界的环境之间，活人可能很快就会发现自己与死人一样多。",
	"Characters can pursue all manner of goals to the Underworld. Many center on finding something that was lost with no other means available to recover it. Perhaps this means rescuing a dead soul when resurrection magic isn't an option or retrieving a vital piece of information from someone who wasn't supposed to die. This might even mean pursuing the soul of a player character, particularly if they're somehow barred from being returned to life through usual magical means. In such a case, consider allowing the player to run a temporary character who assists the party in the rescue or to play their own character as a soul and let them rejoin the party to help effect their own escape.": "角色可以追求各种方式的地下世界的目标。许多人的目标是寻找丢失的东西，而没有其他方法可以恢复它。也许这意味着在复活魔法不可行的情况下拯救一个死去的灵魂，或者从一个不应该死去的人身上找回一个重要的信息。这甚至可能意味着追寻玩家角色的灵魂，特别是如果他们在某种程度上被禁止通过通常的魔法手段恢复生命。在这种情况下，可以考虑让玩家扮演一个临时角色，协助党派进行营救，或者将自己的角色作为一个灵魂，让他们重新加入党派，帮助实现自己的逃脱。",
	"Regardless of why living characters might enter the Underworld, those who attempt the undertaking might seek to learn more about the realm of the dead, its various wards (see {@book chapter 3|MOT|3|The Underworld}), and where the object of their quest ended up. Oracles of any of the gods might aid in divining these details, but those likely to be the most precise—followers of Erebos—are also the least likely to be interested in aiding an Underworld escape. How characters turn such an oracle to their side and determine the accuracy of the information they receive are all part of such a momentous quest.": "不管活着的角色为什么会进入冥界，那些试图进入冥界的人可能会寻求了解更多关于亡灵界的信息，它的各种防护措施（见{@book chapter 3|MOT|3|The Underworld}），以及他们追求的目标最终在哪里出现。任何一个神的神谕都可以帮助预知这些细节，但那些可能最精确的神--埃瑞波斯的追随者--也最不可能对帮助冥界逃脱感兴趣。角色如何将这样的神谕转到自己一边，并确定他们所得到的信息的准确性，都是这样一个重要探索的一部分。",

	"When a character dies, their adventures don't need to end. The Underworld presents an opportunity to provide a sense of closure for deceased characters—as adventurers' ends tend to be quite sudden—or to give them a way to continue engaging in the quest while their companions attempt to bring them back to life.": "当一个角色死亡时，他们的冒险并不需要结束。冥界提供了一个机会，为死去的角色提供一种结束感--因为冒险者的结局往往很突然，或者在他们的同伴试图让他们复活的时候，给他们一种继续参与探索的方式。",
	"These interludes can be played as brief scenes where the player of the dead character is in the spotlight and the rest of the group observes.

	"Most adventurers hope their lives come to an end with some worthy conclusion. Sometimes in the heat of battle, though, that end can be abrupt and without real resolution. An epilogue featuring a hero's soul descending into the Underworld, crossing the Tartyx River, and being guided—or dragged—to the ward which awaits them might create that satisfying conclusion.": "大多数冒险家都希望他们的生活能以某种有价值的结论来结束。但有时在激烈的战斗中，这种结束可能是突然的，没有真正的解决办法。一个以英雄的灵魂进入冥界、渡过塔提克斯河、被引导或被拖到等待他们的病房为特色的尾声，可能会创造出令人满意的结论。",
	"Consider memorable moments from the character's story and how they can be reflected in the events of their final descent. Maybe they see the souls of friends, allies, or loved ones who perished, whether their fates are good or ill. Perhaps a villain the hero slew now exists as a broken misera, giving mute testament to the hero's success. Characters who overcame their personal flaws might even be confronted with symbolic or direct examples of their past failings and rebuke their old vices in a final, crystallizing act of growth.": "考虑人物故事中令人难忘的时刻，以及这些时刻如何反映在他们最后下降的事件中。也许他们看到了朋友、盟友或所爱之人的灵魂，无论他们的命运是好是坏。也许英雄杀死的反派现在作为一个破碎的misera存在，为英雄的成功提供了无声的证明。克服了个人缺陷的人物甚至可能面对他们过去失败的象征性或直接的例子，在最后的成长结晶中斥责他们的旧恶习。",
	"When adventurers in higher tiers of play die, they can often expect to be resurrected. In these cases, an interlude where the hero gets a glimpse of the afterlife awaiting them can be powerful. From a personal standpoint, this sort of interlude can serve to reinforce a character's choices and actions or offer a warning of what's to come if their priorities don't change.": "当高等级游戏的冒险者死亡时，他们往往可以期待复活。在这种情况下，让英雄瞥见等待他们的来世的插曲可能会很有力。从个人的角度来看，这种插曲可以加强角色的选择和行动，或者提供一个警告，告诉他们如果不改变优先次序将会发生什么。",
	"For characters who embrace heroic virtues and live as a beneficial force in the world, they might spend a few hours or days in the idyllic embrace of Ilysia. On the other hand, those who have stained their soul with dark acts might return to life after suffering what feels like years of torture in Tizerus's Mire of Punishment.": "对于那些拥护英雄美德并作为世界的有益力量而生活的人物，他们可能会在伊利亚的田园诗般的怀抱中度过几个小时或几天。另一方面，那些用黑暗行为玷污了自己灵魂的人，可能会在泰泽鲁斯的惩罚之沼中遭受感觉像是多年的折磨后，重新回到生活中。",
	"In either case, the character might even gain some helpful insight into their current predicament or a portent of events to come. Maybe the soul of a long dead sage offers guidance or a legend the hero long idolized provides advice on how they defeated a similar threat. Silent contemplation while sailing on the Nerono oceans could give the character time to decipher part of a mystery. An Underworld demon might even say something that only one of the character's dead rivals could have known. Whatever a character learns during their temporary death, they can carry with them back into the mortal world. Such might make dying one of the most helpful things to happen in a character's greater heroic career.": "在这两种情况下，角色甚至可能获得对他们当前困境的一些有用的洞察力，或对未来事件的预示。也许一个死去多年的圣人的灵魂提供了指导，或者一个英雄长期崇拜的传说提供了关于他们如何战胜类似威胁的建议。在Nerono海洋上航行时的默默沉思可以给角色提供时间来破译部分谜团。一个地下世界的恶魔甚至可能说一些只有角色的一个死去的对手才知道的事情。无论角色在暂时死亡期间学到了什么，他们都可以带着这些东西回到凡间。这可能使死亡成为一个角色的伟大英雄生涯中最有帮助的事情之一。",
	"Those who are prepared for death, or who receive funeral rites, typically have or are given a coin (or similar token of value) interred with their corpse.

	"Those who don't have a coin with them when they die and aren't given funeral rites have no means to pay Athreos's toll and thus have no way of reaching their place of rest. These lost souls primarily collect along the Tartyx's shores where they languish or beg for coins to pay for their passage. Some wander away from the shore, though, becoming ghosts or other undead. Only if their body is granted funeral rites or if the living give them payment for Athreos can such souls find rest.": "那些死后没有带硬币的人，如果不举行葬礼仪式，就没有办法支付阿瑟罗斯的通行费，因此也就没有办法到达他们的安息之地。这些迷失的灵魂主要聚集在塔提克斯的海岸边，他们在那里苦苦挣扎或乞讨硬币来支付他们的通行费。不过，有些人离开了海岸，变成了幽灵或其他亡灵。只有当他们的身体被授予葬礼仪式，或者活人给他们支付Athreos的费用，这些灵魂才能得到安息。",
	"If a soul meets all the challenges set before it and slips from Erebos's clutches, several things likely happen:": "如果一个灵魂满足了摆在它面前的所有挑战，并从埃雷伯斯的魔掌中滑落，可能会发生几件事。",
	"The soul becomes a true, physical being. It is in a new version of its body, a physical manifestation of the soul's perception of itself (which may or may not be identical to its former body).": "灵魂成为一个真正的、有形的存在。它处在一个新版本的身体中，是灵魂对自身认知的物理表现（可能与之前的身体相同，也可能不相同）。",
	"The soul's former body has no further connection to the soul; it is an inert, empty shell. Casting spells on the body that restore it to life simply have no effect.": "灵魂以前的身体与灵魂没有进一步的联系；它是一个惰性的空壳。对身体施展恢复其生命的法术，根本没有效果。",
	"Any object carried out of the Underworld becomes a real, physical thing in the mortal world, with all the properties and features common to objects of its type.": "任何被带出冥界的物体在凡间都会成为一个真实的、有形的东西，具有同类物体所共有的所有属性和特征。",
	"When a spirit reaches the Underworld, they find that they're far from alone. The nature of the Underworld under Erebos's rule takes its toll on even the heartiest souls. As time wears on, most of the dead feel the weight of ages and misery. Souls suffer injury and pain just as living creatures do, and even the dead can perish over time or after enduring multiple deaths. The result of these forms of spiritual weathering divides the dead into the following groups:": "当一个灵魂到达冥界时，他们发现自己远非孤独。在埃瑞博斯的统治下，冥界的性质让最健全的灵魂也付出代价。随着时间的流逝，大多数死者都感受到了岁月和苦难的重量。灵魂就像生物一样遭受伤害和痛苦，即使是死者也会随着时间的推移或在经历多次死亡后灭亡。这些形式的精神风化的结果将死者分为以下几类。",
	"{@b Neoli} are newcomers to the Underworld—vibrant spirits who remember their lives and, in many cases, are coming to terms with death.": "{@b Neoli}是新加入冥界的人--充满活力的灵魂，他们记得自己的生活，在许多情况下，正在接受死亡。",
	"{@b Glazers} are vacant, misery-worn souls who have endured decades of existence in the Underworld. Most have spent far more time dead than they did alive and remember life as little more than a faded dream.": "{@b Glazers}是空虚、痛苦的灵魂，他们在冥界忍受了几十年的存在。大多数人死后的时间远远多于活着的时间，在他们的记忆中，生命不过是一场消逝的梦。",
	"{@b Misera} are souls permanently turned to stone after enduring numerous deaths in the Underworld. These corpses of the dead linger where they {@condition petrified} until they crumble to dust.": "{@b Misera}是在冥界经历了无数次死亡后永久变成石头的灵魂。这些死者的尸体在他们{@condition petrified}的地方徘徊，直到他们溃散成尘。",
	"Despite the inexorable pull of Erebos's lash, even death itself can end—or at least be forestalled. Simply walking out the way one entered isn't an option—Athreos refuses to ferry souls back across the Tartyx. Other pathways that connect the Underworld and the living world are guarded by vicious creatures. Still, there are a few means by which a dead soul can return to life.": "尽管Erebos的鞭打是不可阻挡的，但即使是死亡本身也可以结束，或者至少可以阻止。简单地从进入的方向走出去并不是一种选择--埃瑞博斯拒绝将灵魂渡过塔提克斯。其他连接冥界和活人世界的通道则由邪恶的生物把守。不过，还是有一些方法可以让死去的灵魂重获新生。",
	"Creatures that fly across the Tartyx without Erebos's permission find themselves attacked by flocks of vicious monsters. The demons of the Underworld make this flight with better success than most, though. By bargaining or force, a demon might be convinced to carry a soul on this lengthy, dangerous flight. Should a soul manage to survive the harrowing journey, it finds itself restored to life in the mortal world.": "未经埃瑞博斯允许而飞越塔提克斯的生物会发现自己被成群的恶性怪物攻击。不过，冥界的恶魔在这次飞行中比大多数人更成功。通过讨价还价或武力，恶魔可能被说服携带灵魂进行这种漫长而危险的飞行。如果一个灵魂能够在这段痛苦的旅程中幸存下来，它就会发现自己在凡间恢复了生命。",
	"To attempt this means of escape, a party must bargain with a demon or acquire another means of flight in the Underworld. Then they'd better be ready for the fight of their lives as demons, harpies, and other deadly foes pursue them.": "为了尝试这种逃跑方式，当事人必须与恶魔讨价还价，或者在冥界获得其他的飞行手段。然后，他们最好准备好在恶魔、女妖和其他致命敌人的追击下进行一场生命的战斗。",
	"Hidden in the bowels of Erebos's palace is the portal Lathos, which leads to the mortal world. Moreover, tales say that Lathos can restore a soul to life without any cost or loss of one's identity and sense of self. This isn't to say that Lathos is an easy path to walk, however. Erebos's most fearsome servants guard the portal. So far, no one has succeeded in escaping through Lathos, and the location of the portal's exit in the mortal world is unknown.": "隐藏在埃雷伯斯宫殿深处的门户Lathos，是通往凡人世界的。此外，传说Lathos可以让一个人的灵魂恢复生机，而不需要付出任何代价，也不会失去身份和自我意识。然而，这并不是说Lathos是一条容易走的路。埃里伯斯最可怕的仆人守卫着这个入口。到目前为止，还没有人成功地通过Lathos逃脱，门户在凡人世界的出口位置也是未知的。",
	"Escaping through Lathos is likely an appealing option as the portal exacts no price. The trick is reaching it. Perhaps the characters know some secret that Erebos covets and so might bargain for access. Alternatively, they might conduct an elaborate infiltration of Erebos's palace. Such would be a challenging endeavor but also a feat worthy of legend.": "通过拉托斯逃跑可能是一个很有吸引力的选择，因为这个门户不需要付出任何代价。诀窍是到达它。也许角色们知道一些埃雷伯斯觊觎的秘密，所以可以通过讨价还价来获得入口。或者，他们可以对埃里伯斯的宫殿进行一次精心的渗透。这将是一个具有挑战性的努力，但也是一个值得传说的壮举。",
	"The god Phenax, once a mortal who died and passed into the Underworld, was the first to discover a way to escape, forever known as the Path of Phenax. As part of his escape, he swam across the Tartyx, whose waters stripped away his identity. Without that vital part of his being, Phenax couldn't be detected by Athreos, and Erebos couldn't snare him with his great whip.": "神Phenax曾经是一个死后进入冥界的凡人，他是第一个发现逃生方法的人，永远被称为Phenax之路。作为逃亡的一部分，他游过塔提克斯河，河水带走了他的身份。没有了他的重要部分，Phenax就不能被Athreos发现，Erebos也不能用他的大鞭子抽打他。",
	"Since Phenax's escape, other souls have repeated his dangerous journey. When mortal souls travel the Path of Phenax, the Tartyx washes away their identities, symbolized by their faces, which become nothing more than blank flesh. Souls that successfully emerge on the mortal side of the Tartyx River become Returned, with no knowledge of their former name or past life. As this is a known consequence, most souls forge a gold mask to carry with them. This mask becomes the proxy identity worn by all Returned. Souls' lost identities continue to exist, though, becoming eidolons, which scatter throughout the mortal realm, having no connection to their Returned bodies. (See {@book chapter 6|MOT|6|Returned} for more information about eidolons and the Returned.)": "自从Phenax逃脱后，其他灵魂也重复了他的危险旅程。当凡人的灵魂走过Phenax之路，Tartyx河就会洗去他们的身份，他们的脸就象征着变成了空白的肉体。成功出现在塔提克斯河凡人一侧的灵魂成为回归者，对他们以前的名字和过去的生活一无所知。由于这是一个众所周知的后果，大多数灵魂都铸造了一个金面具，随身携带。这个面具成为所有回归者佩戴的代理身份。不过，灵魂失去的身份继续存在，成为Eidolons，散布在凡间，与回归者的身体没有任何联系。(关于Eidolons和回归者的更多信息，请参见{@book chapter 6|MOT|6|Returned}。",
	"Traveling the Path of Phenax can present an exciting but challenging option for most parties, as it results in affected characters becoming a monster of some type—either an eidolon or a Returned. If you're comfortable with characters playing as monsters or retiring their characters at the end of the quest, this can be a rewarding arc to play through. You might also introduce some means to reunite a character's eidolon with its Returned body and restore the character to at least some semblance of their former self. This should be a monumental undertaking, as it shakes the foundation of Theros's division of life and death.": "对大多数人来说，走 \"Phenax之路 \"是一个令人兴奋但又具有挑战性的选择，因为它导致受影响的角色成为某种类型的怪物--要么是Eidolon，要么是回归者。如果你能接受角色成为怪物或在任务结束后退役，这将是一个很有意义的游戏过程。你也可以引入一些方法，让角色的伊多龙与它的回归者身体重合，并使角色至少恢复到他们以前的样子。这应该是一项艰巨的任务，因为它动摇了Theros的生与死的划分基础。",
	"The exact details of Phenax's route are unclear, and aside from forging masks and a final swim, any number of challenges among islands in the Tartyx might comprise the path.": "Phenax路线的确切细节尚不清楚，除了锻造面具和最后的游泳之外，Tartyx岛屿之间的任何数量的挑战都可能构成这条路。",

	"More than just for their deeds, heroes fill an important role among the inhabitants of Theros. Legendary heroes form a vast collection of well-known archetypes whose deeds create cultural touchstones and shape modern philosophies. They also embody the potential of mortals to be more than mere drops in the raging river of fate. Tales of heroes teach that greatness is achievable and that there is more to the world than what any one individual knows. The people of Theros see the truth of this in the powers of the gods and in the immortal constellations that fill the night sky. Even as the names of individual heroes might eventually fade away, their deeds live on as heroic archetypes—such as in the case of the nameless champion in the renowned epic, {@i The Theriad}. These archetypes teach and inspire, whether they're represented in tales of journeys or creation, in sculptures rising above polis roofs, or in the temples of the gods. Throughout Theros, those who seek greatness typically begin by deciding what heroic archetype they most closely align with and letting that ideal influence their fate.": "英雄不仅仅因为他们的事迹而备受尊敬，在Theros的居民中扮演着重要角色。传奇英雄们构成了一个庞大的众所周知的原型集合，他们的事迹创造了文化的里程碑，塑造了现代哲学。他们也体现了凡人超越命运洪流中的微不足道的一滴的潜力。英雄的传说教导人们伟大是可以实现的，世界上不仅仅是任何一个个体所知道的。Theros的人们从众神的力量和星空中的不朽星座中看到了这一点的真相。即使个别英雄的名字最终可能会逐渐被遗忘，他们的事迹作为英雄原型将永存——就像在著名史诗{@i The Theriad}中那位无名的英雄一样。这些原型教导并激励着人们，无论是在旅程或创造的故事中，还是在高耸在城邦屋顶上的雕塑中，或者在众神的神庙里。在Theros，那些追求伟大的人通常会从决定他们最接近的英雄原型开始，并让这种理想影响他们的命运。",
	"The origin and generations of the gods—from the primordial titans to the modern pantheon now worshiped in Theros—are described in {@book chapter 2|MOT|2}. The world's myths also fill this book, stories that still resonate in the dreams and ambitions of Theros's people. These myths are noted in distinct sections, with the first appearing in {@book chapter 1|MOT|1}. Yet the largely agreed upon history of mortal folk on Theros occurred more recently and is thought to have unfolded as follows.": "神祇的起源和世代——从原始泰坦到现在在Theros中受到崇拜的现代全体神祇——在{@book chapter 2|MOT|2}中有所描述。这本书中还充满了世界神话，这些故事仍然在Theros人民的梦想和抱负中产生共鸣。这些神话在不同的部分中有所记载，第一部分出现在{@book chapter 1|MOT|1}中。然而，关于Theros凡间人类历史的大部分被普遍认为发生在最近，据认为发展如下。",
	"The saga of Callaphe the Mariner, told in {@i The Callapheiea}, is a more coherent narrative focused on a single hero and her exploits. Known as the greatest mariner who ever lived, Callaphe was a human trickster from Meletis who sailed a ship called {@i The} {@i Monsoon}. She was the first mortal to decipher the secret patterns of the winds (provoking Thassa's ire), and she sailed over the edge of the world and into Nyx to claim her place among the stars. The tales of her adventures are a mythic tour of the Dakra Isles and the coastlands of Theros, describing a panoply of creatures, nations, and marvelous phenomena—some of which still exist as described in its verses, though others are lost to history or myth.": "{@i The Callapheiea}中讲述的Callaphe the Mariner传奇故事更加连贯，聚焦于一个英雄及其壮举。作为有史以来最伟大的水手，Callaphe是来自Meletis的人类骗子，驾驶一艘名为{@i The} {@i Monsoon}的船。她是第一个能解读风之秘密模式（激怒了Thassa）的凡人，她航行到世界的边缘，进入Nyx，以夺取她在星星中的位置。她的冒险故事描述了Dakra群岛和Theros沿岸地区的神话之旅，描绘了各种生物、国家和奇妙现象——其中一些仍然如诗歌中描述的存在，而其他一些则已经消失在历史或神话中。",
	"The Age of Heroes has not yet come to an end, and more epics will surely be sung and written as more heroes take their destinies into their own hands and chart their paths to the stars. The heroes of recent memory—Haktos the Unscarred, Siona and her crew on the {@i Pyleas}, Kytheon Iora, Elspeth and Daxos, Anax and Cymede, Ajani Goldmane, and countless others—are no less heroic than the protagonists of age-old epics, even if their deeds aren't yet as widely known. Beyond individuals—a kraken attack on Meletis; the fall of the monstrous hydra {@creature Polukranos|MOT}; the Nyxborn assault on Akros; Erebos's titan felled by Heliod's champion; the apotheosis and destruction of the mortal-turned-god Xenagos—the epic events of the recent past are already remembered and retold as mythic deeds.

	"If you're reading this, the answer is that {@i you} make a hero, of course. In Theros, player characters and heroes are synonymous, being rare individuals whose deeds aren't bound by fate, who willfully stray from the paths laid before them and chart their own courses.": "如果你正在阅读这个，答案就是{@i you}当然会成为一个英雄。在(Theros)中，玩家角色和英雄是同义词，他们是稀有的个体，他们的事迹不受命运束缚，他们自愿偏离既定道路，开创自己的道路。",

	"Countless tales tell the history, deeds, and nature of the gods. Sometimes these stories play out among the constellations in the night sky. They are chanted in hymns during the gods' festivals, inscribed in temple walls, told around campfires and hearths, and collected on scrolls. Some are simple fables meant to illustrate a single facet of a god's character or of moral behavior. Others are monumental epics, most notably {@i The Cosmogony}, a poem by an unnamed Meletian sage that includes several (sometimes conflicting) tales of the creation of the world and beyond.": "无数传说讲述了众神的历史、事迹和本性。有时这些故事在夜空中的星座中上演。它们在众神的节日中被诵读为赞美诗，在寺庙墙壁上被刻写，围着篝火和炉边讲述，并被收集在卷轴上。有些是简单的寓言，旨在说明一个神的特质或道德行为的一个方面。另一些是巨大的史诗，尤其是{@i The Cosmogony}，一首由一位未透露姓名的梅莱提亚贤者创作的诗歌，其中包括了几个（有时相互矛盾的）关于世界创造及更远的故事。",
	"The epic poem called {@i The Theriad} is another such collection. It describes the exploits of various champions of Heliod, all of whom are simply called \"the Champion,\" as if they were a single individual. Because the identities of the heroes aren't mentioned, the tales have more to say about the character of Heliod than about any champion's mortal deeds.": "史诗诗歌名为{@i The Theriad}的作品也是这样的收集。它描述了赫利奥德的各种英雄的壮举，所有这些英雄都被简单地称为“冠军”，仿佛他们是一个人。由于英雄的身份没有被提及，这些故事更多地反映了赫利奥德的性格，而不是任何一个冠军的凡人事迹。",

	"Another important venue for recreation is the theater. The works of celebrated playwrights, past and present, are regularly produced by casts of professional actors.

Such a performance might stretch over two or three days.": "另一个重要的娱乐场所是剧院。著名剧作家的作品，无论是过去还是现在，都经常由专业演员阵容演出。偶尔，一个故事讲述者，在小型管弦乐队的伴奏下，吸引了观众前往剧院聆听伟大史诗之一的朗诵，比如{@i The} {@i Theriad}或{@i The} {@i Callapheia}。这样的表演可能会持续两三天。",
	"The hoplites of Meletis practice battlefield tactics in an environment saturated with religious devotion. The military force of the polis is called the Reverent Army, and aims as much to exalt the glory of the pantheon as to defend Meletis.

	"When young men reach the age of fourteen, their rites of passage culminate in a journey called {@i peregrination}, where they wander the world until they find a new place to call home.

Some of these men never peregrinated, but others left and then returned to Setessa.": "当年轻男子达到十四岁时，他们的成人礼达到高潮，这一过程被称为{@i peregrination}，在这个旅程中，他们漫游世界，直到找到一个新的家园。在塞特萨（Setessa）永久居住的少数男子住在阿马特罗丰（Amatrophon），在那里训练和照顾那里的动物。这些男子中有些从未进行过朝圣之旅，但也有一些离开过然后回到了塞特萨。",
	"In contrast to the discipline associated with educating children in other poleis, Setessan youngsters enjoy tremendous freedom. Called {@i arkulli}, meaning \"little bears,\" they are welcome anywhere in the city. They often wander in and out of the temple, training grounds, the hall of the Ruling Council, the market, and anywhere else their paths take them. Such freedom is meant to cultivate a curious spirit and help the children find the path they're most interested in following later in life.": "与其他城邦教育孩童的纪律相比，赛特桑的年轻人享受着巨大的自由。被称为“小熊”{@i arkulli}，他们在城市中随处可见。他们经常在神庙、训练场、执政议会大厅、市场以及任何其他地方徘徊。这种自由旨在培养好奇心，并帮助孩子们找到他们在未来生活中最感兴趣的道路。",
	"Scattered throughout the city are several groves that are sacred to Karametra and Nylea, made up of slender trees with almost humanlike forms. It is said that whoever enters one of these sacred groves in search of peace will find it—and take root, becoming part of the grove.

	"Each year, on the day of the first full moon after the autumn equinox, matriarchs from all the leonin prides gather at Tethmos to select a monarch, who acts as a representative of the prides in the wider world.

	"Most of the minotaurs that roam the badlands of Phoberos are outcasts from the society of Skophos. They are bandits and marauders, bloodthirsty killers infected by the wild rage of Mogis. These minotaurs have more in common with the monsters in the {@book Monster Manual|MM} than with the civilized people described in {@book chapter 1|MOT|1|Minotaur} of this book (including their Large size). Most of them use only the barest minimum of technology—tattered clothes, piecemeal armor, and heavy weapons, all scavenged from their fallen foes. They wander alone or gather in bands under the leadership of the strongest among them, and in either case tend to kill any human they encounter. Three distinct bands are particularly well-known by their Akroan foes.": "在福贝洛斯（Phoberos）的荒原上漫游的大角魔（minotaurs）大多是来自斯科福斯（Skophos）社会的流亡者。它们是强盗和掠夺者，被莫吉斯（Mogis）的狂暴之怒所感染的嗜血杀手。这些大角魔与本书描述的文明人（包括它们的大型体型）相比，更像是{@book Monster Manual|MM}中的怪物。它们大多只使用最基本的技术——破烂的衣服、拼凑的盔甲和沉重的武器，都是从它们倒下的敌人身上搜刮而来。它们独自漫游或聚集在最强者的领导下，无论哪种情况，都倾向于杀死任何遇到的人类。其中有三支明显的部落被它们的阿克罗斯（Akroan）敌人熟知。",
	"Walking the Path of Phenax doesn't restore a soul to its life. Those who return from the Underworld are hollow shells inhabited by grim and purposeless spirits. These Returned are separated from their memories, which become wandering eidolons (see {@book chapter 6|MOT|6|Eidolons}). They retain their personalities and skills, but each Returned tends to be a very different being from who they once were.

	"When mortals sleep and dream, they are said to \"visit Nyx.\" During this time, mortals are particularly susceptible to divine contact.

Regardless, catoblepases are widely viewed as cursed creatures, which only Mogis's faithful hold in wicked esteem.": "传说中有一个人类牧民自吹其牲畜是赛洛斯（Theros）最优秀的。当众神听闻此事，赫利奥德（Heliod）、奈莉亚（Nylea）和莫吉斯（Mogis）介入，施加了一种诅咒，使这位凡人及其牲畜受到影响，从而诞生了第一只卡托布莱帕斯。然而，众神是如何介入的，出于何种高尚或琐碎的原因，众神的信徒，特别是赫利奥德和奈莉亚的信徒，都在激烈地辩论中（见{@book chapter 2|MOT|2|Myths of Nylea}）。无论如何，卡托布莱帕斯被普遍视为受诅咒的生物，只有莫吉斯的信徒将其视为邪恶的象征。",
	"The human polis of Akros maintains an outpost in the Katachthon Mountains to keep an eye on the cyclops population around One-Eyed Pass (see {@book chapter 3|MOT|3|The Katachthon Mountains}). From the cyclopes' perspective, the Akroan soldiers provide a reliable source of food, for the soldiers herd approaching enemies into cyclops territory rather than fighting these foes themselves. Thus, the cyclopes attack the Akroans just enough to keep the humans afraid of them, but not so much that they eliminate them or drive them off.": "阿克洛斯（Akros）的人类城邦在卡塔克通山脉（Katachthon Mountains）保持了一个前哨站，以监视独眼峡口（One-Eyed Pass）周围的独眼巨人族群。从独眼巨人的角度来看，阿克洛斯士兵为他们提供了可靠的食物来源，因为这些士兵会把接近的敌人赶入独眼巨人的领地，而不是自己与这些敌人战斗。因此，独眼巨人会袭击阿克洛斯人，只是足够让人类害怕他们，但不至于消灭他们或赶走他们。",
	"Night hags on Theros appear as leathery-faced crones that hold their single eye within their withered lips as they stare with eyeless sockets. They usually build their huts in the Underworld, particularly around the towering pillars of basalt and granite within the Mire of Punishment (see {@book chapter 3|MOT|3|Tizerus}). There, amid the lamentations of those who have offended the gods, night hags inhale the smoke of toxic balefires. They follow the visions the smoke invokes to the dreams of vulnerable mortals where they sow the seeds of folly.": "在赛洛斯（Theros）上，夜行女巫（Night hags）看起来像是皱纹满面的老妇人，她们将独眼藏在干瘪的嘴唇中，用无眼的眼窝凝视着周围。她们通常在地底世界建造自己的小屋，特别是在惩罚泥沼（Mire of Punishment）中那些巨大的玄武岩和花岗岩柱子周围（见{@book chapter 3|MOT|3|Tizerus}）。在那里，在冒犯了众神的人们的哀叹声中，夜行女巫吸入有毒篝火的烟雾。她们追随烟雾唤起的幻象，进入脆弱凡人的梦境，播下愚蠢的种子。",
	"This section describes three of Theros's most infamous terrors, beings whose might and dreadful deeds set them apart as menaces of legendary proportions. While many of Theros's greatest myths arise from storied terrors—like the hydra {@creature Polukranos|MOT} or the dreaded titans—the monsters in this section have a feature that sets them apart: mythic traits.": "这一部分描述了Theros（(瑟洛斯)）三个最臭名昭著的恐怖存在，他们的力量和可怕行为使他们成为传奇般的威胁。尽管Theros（(瑟洛斯)）许多伟大神话故事源自传说的恐怖存在，比如九头蛇{@creature Polukranos|MOT}或可怕的泰坦，但本节中的怪物有一个与众不同的特点：神话特质。",
	"But those who enter her domain unbidden almost never go unnoticed, for {@creature Arasta|MOT} can sense the slightest vibration along her web hair, and her children act as spies on her behalf.": "但是那些擅自进入她领地的人几乎从不会被察觉，因为{@creature Arasta|MOT}可以感知到她网状头发上最微小的振动，而她的子女们则充当她的间谍。",
	"On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), {@creature Arasta|MOT} can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects. She can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.": "在20号先攻计数（先攻相同时，先失去先攻），{@creature Arasta|MOT}可以采取巢穴行动，产生以下效果之一。她不能连续两轮使用相同的效果。",
	"Theros's reclusive medusas often delight in collecting and expanding their galleries of {@condition petrified} victims. Unlike other medusas, {@creature Hythonia|MOT} isn't merely a collector; she's an artist.": "在瑟洛斯(Theros)偏僻的美杜莎们经常喜欢收集和扩展她们的{@condition petrified}受害者画廊。与其他美杜莎不同，{@creature Hythonia|MOT}(She)不仅仅是一个收藏家；她是一位艺术家。",
	"When {@creature Hythonia|MOT} came to the island of Skathos, the inhabitants worshiped her as an avatar of the god Pharika. The cultists eagerly offered themselves up to the {@creature medusa|MOT}'s petrifying gaze in hopes of gaining Pharika's favor. Seeing herself surrounded by willing devotees, {@creature Hythonia|MOT} formulated a cruel plan. After encouraging them to engage in wild rituals, {@creature Hythonia|MOT} began turning her followers to stone, weaving their forms to create a grisly throne made of their {@condition petrified} bodies.": "当{@creature Hythonia|MOT}来到斯卡索斯岛时，居民们将她奉为法瑞卡之神的化身。那些狂热的教徒们迫不及待地向{@creature medusa|MOT}的凝视献身，希望得到法瑞卡的青睐。看到自己被围绕着愿意献身的信徒，{@creature Hythonia|MOT}构思出了一个残忍的计划。在鼓励他们参与狂野仪式后，{@creature Hythonia|MOT}开始将她的追随者变成石头，编织他们的形体以创造一个由他们{@condition petrified}的尸体构成的可怕宝座。",
	"On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), {@creature Hythonia|MOT} can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects. She can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:": "在20号先攻（失败则先攻平局）时，{@creature Hythonia|MOT} 可以采取巢穴行动，产生以下效果之一。她不能连续两轮使用相同的效果：",
	"{@creature Hythonia|MOT} briefly animates creatures that have been {@condition petrified} by her gaze. Each statue attacks one creature within 5 feet of it, with a +11 bonus to hit and dealing 10 ({@dice 3d6}) bludgeoning damage on a hit. If a Medium or smaller creature takes this damage, it is also {@condition grappled} (escape DC 15).": "{@creature Hythonia|MOT} 通过凝视让生物短暂地复活。每座雕像攻击一个距离5英尺内的生物，命中加值+11，造成10({@dice 3d6}) 钝击伤害。如果一个中型或更小的生物受到这个伤害，它也会被{@condition grappled} (逃脱 DC 15)。",
	"Trees within 1 mile of the lair are petrified wood. Plants that stay within 500 feet of the lair for 1 day turn to stone.": "距离巢穴1英里范围内的树木会变成石化木。在巢穴周围500英尺范围内逗留1天的植物会变成石头。",
	"Small bodies of water within 1 mile of the lair become poisonous. A creature that drinks the water must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or become {@condition poisoned} for 8 hours. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each hour.": "距离巢穴1英里内的小水体会变得有毒。饮用这些水的生物必须通过一次DC 19的体质豁免才能免疫{@condition poisoned}，持续8小时。受影响的生物每小时可以再次进行豁免检定。",
	"Most krakens roam the seas, shattering hulls and scattering fleets, but the kraken {@creature Tromokratis|MOT} notoriously vents its wrath on coastal settlements. Whether it acts at the command of the god Thassa or to sate its own hunger, {@creature Tromokratis|MOT} numbers among the most feared threats in the sea, having no fixed lair and wandering where it will. In recent memory, the massive menace rose from the waves to topple the Pyrgnos, Meletis's great repository of scholarly knowledge. Since that day, the polis keeps a watch specifically for {@creature Tromokratis|MOT}.": "大多数海怪在海上漫游，摧毁船体，驱散舰队，但{@creature Tromokratis|MOT}海怪却以对沿海定居点发泄愤怒而著称。无论是受到塔莎女神的命令还是为了满足自己的饥饿，{@creature Tromokratis|MOT}是海中最令人畏惧的威胁之一，没有固定的巢穴，随心所欲地游荡。在最近的记忆中，这个巨大的威胁从海浪中升起，推翻了梅莱提斯的伟大知识库——皮格诺斯。自那一天起，城邦特别留意{@creature Tromokratis|MOT}的出现。",
	"{@creature Tromokratis|MOT} is a particularly cantankerous nadir kraken that has claimed all the sea as its territory. A tumultuous sea is often attributed to {@creature Tromokratis|MOT} battling another kraken to assert its claim. Often, before a journey, sailors blow conch-shell horns in the belief that the sound will soothe nearby krakens.": "{@creature Tromokratis|MOT} 是一只特别脾气暴躁的低谷海怪，它已经宣称整片海域为自己的领地。常常有人将汹涌的海洋归因于{@creature Tromokratis|MOT} 与另一只海怪争夺领地。在启程前，水手们常常吹响海螺壳号角，相信这种声音会安抚附近的海怪。",
	"Legend speaks of a magic horn that the hero Humenades used in ancient times to summon {@creature Tromokratis|MOT} to lay waste to a cursed city lost to evil ways. The horn was so powerful that, after the city was destroyed, Humenades took it to Tizerus and buried it under a stone near the palace of Erebos.": "传说中有一只魔法号角，英雄胡梅纳德斯在古代曾使用它召唤{@creature Tromokratis|MOT}，摧毁了一个被邪恶笼罩的诅咒之城。这只号角如此强大，以至于在城市被摧毁后，胡梅纳德斯将它带到提泽鲁斯，并将其埋在厄瑞波斯宫附近的一块石头下。",
