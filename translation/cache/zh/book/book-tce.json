{
	"{@i Tasha's Cauldron of Everything} offers a host of new options for Dungeons & Dragons, and our journey through those options is accompanied by the notes of the wizard Tasha. Creator of the spell {@spell Tasha's hideous laughter}, Tasha's life is one of the most storied in the D&D multiverse. Raised by Baba Yaga, the Mother of Witches herself, Tasha adventured across the world of Greyhawk and became the friend and sometimes enemy of other famous adventurers, like Mordenkainen. In time, she ruled as the Witch Queen and later changed her name to Iggwilv—a figure of legend who is whispered about, feared, and admired.": "{@i Tasha's Cauldron of Everything}为《龙与地下城》提供了大量的新选择，而我们在这些选择中的旅程是伴随着巫师塔莎的笔记。塔莎是咒语（%%）的创造者，她的生活是D&D多元宇宙中最有故事的一个。塔莎由女巫之母巴巴-雅加亲自抚养长大，她在灰鹰世界中冒险，并成为其他著名冒险家的朋友，有时也是敌人，比如莫丹卡宁。随着时间的推移，她作为女巫女王进行统治，后来改名为Iggwilv--一个被人低声议论、畏惧和崇拜的传奇人物。",
	" Written for players and Dungeon Masters alike, this book offers options to enhance characters and campaigns in any D&D world, whether you're adventuring in Greyhawk, another official D&D setting, or a world of your own creation.": " 本书是为玩家和地下城主编写的，它提供了在任何D&D世界中增强角色和战役的选项，无论你是在灰鹰、另一个官方D&D设定中冒险，还是在你自己创造的世界中冒险。",
	"{@book Chapter 1|TCE|1} brims with new features and subclasses for the classes in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, and it presents the artificer class, a master of magical invention. The chapter also offers feats for groups that use them.": "{@book Chapter 1|TCE|1}中的类的新特性和子类，并介绍了工匠类，一个魔法发明的大师。这一章还为使用它们的团体提供了功绩。",
	"{@book Chapter 2|TCE|2} contains patrons who can become one of the driving forces behind your group's adventures.": "{@book Chapter 2|TCE|2}包含的赞助人可以成为你的团体冒险背后的驱动力之一。",
	"{@book Chapter 3|TCE|3} sparkles with new magical options, including spells, magical spellbooks, artifacts, and magic-infused tattoos—available for both player characters and monsters to use.": "{@book Chapter 3|TCE|3}闪烁着新的魔法选项，包括法术、魔法书、神器和注入魔法的纹身，玩家角色和怪物都可以使用。",
	"{@book Chapter 4|TCE|4} holds various rules that a DM may incorporate into a campaign, including rules on sidekicks who level up with the player characters and on supernatural environments. The chapter ends with a collection of puzzles ready to be deployed in any adventure that the DM would like to spice up with some puzzling.": "{@book Chapter 4|TCE|4}有各种规则，DM可以将其纳入战役中，包括关于与玩家角色一起升级的小伙伴和超自然环境的规则。这一章的结尾是一个谜题集，准备在DM想用一些谜题来调剂的任何冒险中使用。",
	"Everything in this book is optional. Each group, guided by the DM, decides which of these options, if any, to incorporate into a campaign. You can use some, all, or none of them. We encourage you to choose the ones that fit best with your campaign's story and with your group's style of play.": "本书中的所有内容都是可选的。每个小组在管理员的指导下，决定将这些选项中的哪些（如果有的话）纳入战役中。你可以使用其中的一些，全部，或者不使用。我们鼓励你选择最适合你的活动故事和你的小组游戏风格的选项。",
	" Whatever options you choose to use, this book relies on the rules in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Monster Manual|MM}, and {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, and it can be paired with the options in {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE} and other D&D books.": " 无论你选择使用什么选项，本书都依赖于{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}、{@book Monster Manual|MM}和{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的规则，它可以与{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}和其他D&D书籍中的选项搭配使用。",
	"Much of the material in this book originally appeared in Unearthed Arcana, a series of online articles we publish to explore rules that might officially become part of the game. Some Unearthed Arcana offerings don't end up resonating with fans and are set aside. The Unearthed Arcana material that inspired the options in the following chapters was well received and, thanks to feedback from thousands of D&D fans, has been refined into the official forms presented here.": "本书中的许多材料最初都出现在《未解之谜》中，这是我们发布的一系列在线文章，旨在探索可能正式成为游戏一部分的规则。有些 \"未出之谜 \"的内容最终没有引起粉丝的共鸣而被搁置。启发以下各章选项的Unearthed Arcana材料广受好评，并且由于数千名D&D粉丝的反馈，已经被改进为这里介绍的正式形式。",
	"The rules of D&D cover many of the twists and turns that come up in play, but the possibilities are so vast that the rules can't cover everything. When you encounter something that the rules don't cover or if you're unsure how to interpret a rule, the DM decides how to proceed, aiming for a course that brings the most enjoyment to your whole group.": "D&D的规则涵盖了游戏中出现的许多曲折，但可能性如此之大，规则不可能涵盖一切。当你遇到规则没有涵盖的东西，或者你不确定如何解释一条规则时，DM会决定如何进行，目的是为整个团队带来最大的乐趣。",
	"General rules govern each part of the game. For example, the combat rules tell you that melee weapon attacks use Strength and ranged weapon attacks use Dexterity. That's a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as long as something in the game doesn't explicitly say otherwise.": "一般的规则制约着游戏的每一部分。例如，战斗规则告诉你，近战武器攻击使用力量，远程武器攻击使用灵巧。这是一条一般规则，只要游戏中没有明确的规定，一般规则就会生效。",
	" The game also includes elements—class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the like—that sometimes contradict a general rule. When an exception and a general rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a feature says you can make melee weapon attacks using your Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement disagrees with the general rule.": "  当例外情况和一般规则不一致时，例外情况获胜。例如，如果一个特征说你可以用你的魅力进行近战武器攻击，你就可以这么做，尽管这个说法与一般规则不一致。",
	"Even if more than one factor gives you advantage or disadvantage on a roll, you have it only once, and if you have advantage and disadvantage on the same roll, they cancel each other.": "即使一个以上的因素给你带来优势或劣势，你也只拥有一次，如果你在同一卷中拥有优势和劣势，它们会相互抵消。",
	"If your proficiency bonus applies to a roll, you can add the bonus only once to the roll, even if multiple things in the game say your bonus applies. Moreover, if more than one thing tells you to double or halve your bonus, you double it only once or halve it only once before applying it. Whether multiplied, divided, or left at its normal value, the bonus can be used only once per roll.": "如果你的熟练度加成适用于一个卷，你只能把加成加到该卷上一次，即使游戏中的多个东西都说你的加成适用。此外，如果有多件事情告诉你要将你的奖励加倍或减半，你在应用它之前只能将它加倍一次或减半一次。无论是乘以、除以，还是保持其正常值，奖金在每个卷中只能使用一次。",
	"If you want to cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 bonus action, remember that you can't cast any other spells before or after it on the same turn, except for cantrips with a casting time of 1 action.": "如果你想施放一个施放时间为1个额外行动的法术，请记住，在同一回合内，你不能在它之前或之后施放任何其他法术，除了施放时间为1个行动的咒语。",
	"As soon as you start casting a spell or using a special ability that requires concentration, your concentration on another effect ends instantly.": "只要你开始施法或使用需要集中注意力的特殊能力，你对另一个效果的注意力就会立即结束。",
	"Temporary hit points aren't cumulative. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you don't add them together, unless a game feature says you can. Instead, you decide which temporary hit points to keep.": "临时命中率是不能累积的。如果你有临时命中率并得到了更多的命中率，你不会把它们加在一起，除非有游戏特征说你可以。相反，你要决定保留哪些临时打击点数。",
	"Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.": "每当你在游戏中除以或乘以一个数字时，如果你最后得到的是一个分数，即使这个分数是二分之一或更大，也要向下取整。",
	"You don't need to know every rule to enjoy D&D, and each group has its own style—different ways it likes to tell stories and to use the rules. Embrace what your group enjoys most. In short, follow your bliss!": "你不需要知道每一条规则来享受D&D，每个小组都有自己的风格--喜欢用不同的方式来讲述故事和使用规则。拥抱你的团队最喜欢的东西。简而言之，跟随你的快乐!",
	"My dear, sweet, lucky reader,": "我亲爱的、可爱的、幸运的读者。",
	"You know me. You've heard of my exploits. You've spread my titles: Natasha the Dark, Hura of Ket, Baba Yaga's daughter, witch par excellence, and, if you're not trying to impress, just plain Tasha.": "你认识我。你听说过我的事迹。你已经传播了我的头衔。黑暗中的娜塔莎，凯特的胡拉，巴巴-雅加的女儿，卓越的女巫，如果你不是想给人留下深刻印象，就只是普通的塔莎。",
	"For longer than I care to confess, I've sought out mysteries and wonders that beggar description. (Well, wonders that beggar the descriptions of those not raised in an immortal's dancing hut, as I was.) Within this tome, you'll find a sampling of the curiosities I've documented during my travels, including my exploits with the infamous Company of Seven; my studies with the original Mad Archmage, Zagig Yragerne; and my correspondences with world-hopping (and sanctimonious) luminaries like Mordenkainen. Unfortunately, at Mordenkainen's request, a panel of experts from the Greyhawk Guild of Wizardry—which I'm assured is an esteemed center of learning and not at all an elaborate scam to swindle highborn rubes—has been granted editorial oversight of this work. As a result, I understand that some of my \"less traditional\" findings have been saddled with various rules, for the supposed \"safe continuance of the mystical arts and, indeed, all life in the multiverse.\"": "比我愿意承认的更久以来，我一直在寻找那些难以描述的神秘和奇迹。(好吧，对于那些不是在仙人的舞蹈屋里长大的人来说，这些奇迹更需要描述，就像我一样）。在这本小册子里，你会发现我在旅行中记录的一些奇闻异事，包括我与臭名昭著的七人帮的探险；我与最初的疯狂大法师扎吉格-伊拉格内的研究；以及我与摩登凯恩这样的世界名流（和圣洁的）的通信。不幸的是，应Mordenkainen的要求，灰鹰魔法师公会的一个专家小组--我确信该公会是一个受人尊敬的学习中心，而根本不是一个骗取贵族卢布的精心设计的骗局--被授权对这部作品进行编辑监督。因此，我知道我的一些 \"不那么传统 \"的发现已经被赋予了各种规则，为了所谓的 \"神秘艺术的安全延续，以及事实上，多元宇宙中的所有生命\"。",
	"No matter. Through a combination of irrefutable arguments and spells, I've convinced the editorial board to furnish me with this advance copy of their work. ": "没有关系。通过无可辩驳的论据和法术的结合，我已经说服了编辑部向我提供他们作品的这份预发稿。",
	"In reviewing it, I've added a variety of helpful marginalia. I expect that—with the inclusion of my insights, guidance, threats, and critiques—clever minds will have all they need to advance their accounting of the multiverse's infinite audacities. And even if not, read on and maybe you'll learn something my archmage semi-peers are terrified of you learning.": "在审查过程中，我加入了各种有用的旁注。我希望，随着我的见解、指导、威胁和批评的加入，聪明的人将获得他们所需要的一切，以促进他们对多元宇宙的无限胆量的认识。即使没有，继续读下去，也许你会学到一些我的大法师半同行们害怕你学到的东西。",
	"I'm drawing back the curtain of reality for you, reader dearest. Summon your courage, and take a peek.": "我正在为你拉开现实的帷幕，最亲爱的读者。鼓起你的勇气，看一看吧。",
	"When you make your D&D character, you have an array of options in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} to create the sort of adventurer you want. This chapter adds to those options, making it possible to realize even more character concepts. If you combine these options with those in {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}, the possibilities for your characters become vast.": "当你制作你的D&D角色时，你在{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中有一系列的选项来创造你想要的那种冒险家。本章对这些选项进行了补充，使之有可能实现更多的角色概念。如果你把这些选项和{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}中的选项结合起来，你的角色就会有很大的可能性。",

	"Sometimes you pick a skill proficiency that ends up not being very useful in the campaign or that no longer fits your character's story. In those cases, talk to your DM about replacing that skill proficiency with another skill proficiency offered by your class at 1st level. A convenient time for such a change is when you reach a level that grants you the Ability Score Increase feature, representing that your character has spent a level or two studying the new skill and letting the old one atrophy.": "有时你选择的技能熟练度最终在战役中不是很有用，或者不再适合你的角色的故事。在这种情况下，你可以和你的管理员商量，用你的等级在第一级时提供的另一个技能熟练度来替换这个技能熟练度。进行这种更换的方便时机是，当你的等级达到能使你获得能力分数增加的特征时，代表你的角色已经花了一两级来学习新的技能，并让旧的技能萎缩了。",
	"Each character class involves the choice of a subclass at 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. A subclass represents an area of specialization and offers different class features as you level up. With your DM's approval, you can change your subclass when you would normally gain a new subclass feature. If you decide to make this change, choose another subclass that belongs to your class and replace all your old subclass features with the features of the new subclass that are for your new level and lower.": "每个角色等级在一、二、三级时都可以选择一个子等级。一个子类代表一个专业领域，并在你的等级提升时提供不同的类特性。经DM批准，你可以在通常情况下获得一个新的子类特征时改变你的子类。如果你决定这样做，请选择另一个属于你的阶级的子阶级，并用新的子阶级的特征取代你所有旧的子阶级特征，这些特征是为你的新等级和更低的等级准备的。",
	"To change your subclass, your DM might require you to spend time devoted to the transition, as you study the ways of the new specialization. This transition requires a number of days equal to twice your new level in the class; a higher level represents more to learn.": "要改变你的子阶级，你的管理员可能会要求你花时间专门用于过渡，因为你要学习新的专业方法。这种过渡需要的天数相当于你在该类别的新等级的两倍；更高的等级代表了更多的学习。",
	"The DM might also require an expenditure of money to pay for training, magical reagents, or other goods needed for the transition. The cost is typically 100 gp times your new level. This cost might be accompanied by a quest of some sort. For example, a sorcerer who wants to adopt a Draconic Bloodline could be required to receive blood, a blessing, or both from an ancient dragon.": "DM可能还需要支出一笔钱来支付训练、魔法试剂或其他过渡所需的物品。这笔费用通常是你的新等级的100戈比。这笔费用可能会伴随着某种任务的进行。例如，一个想要采用龙族血统的巫师可能需要从一条古龙那里获得血液、祝福，或者两者都要。",
	"If you return to a subclass that you previously held, you forgo the gold cost, and the time required for the transition is halved.": "如果你回到你以前持有的子类，你就放弃了金币费用，而且过渡所需的时间减半。",
	"Sometimes a character undergoes a dramatic transformation in their beliefs and abilities. When a character experiences a profound self-realization or faces an entity or a place of overwhelming power, beauty, or terror, the DM might allow an immediate subclass change. Here are a few examples:": "有时，一个角色在他们的信仰和能力方面会发生戏剧性的转变。当一个角色经历了深刻的自我领悟，或者面对一个实体或一个具有压倒性力量、美丽或恐怖的地方时，DM可能会允许立即进行子类的改变。这里有几个例子。",
	"An Oath of Devotion paladin failed to stop a demonic horde from ravaging her homeland. After spending a night in sorrowful prayer, she rises the next morning with the features of the Oath of Vengeance, ready to hunt down the horde.": "一位 \"奉献之誓 \"的圣骑士没能阻止一个恶魔部落蹂躏她的家园。在悲伤的祈祷中度过了一个晚上后，她在第二天早上带着复仇之誓的特征起床，准备追捕那支部落。",
	"A wizard lies down for a nap beneath an oak tree whose roots reach into the Feywild. In his dreams, he faces visions of multiple possible futures. When he awakens, his subclass features have been replaced by those of the School of Divination.": "一个巫师躺在一棵橡树下小憩，这棵树的根伸进了精灵世界。在他的梦中，他面临着多种可能的未来的幻觉。当他醒来的时候，他的副类特征已经被占卜学校的特征所取代。",
	"A cleric of the War Domain has spent years in conflict with the enemies of her temple. But one day, she wanders into a sun-dappled glade, where her god once shed a tear of mercy over the world's suffering. Drinking from the glade's brook, the cleric is filled with such compassion for all people that she now bears the powers of the Life Domain, ready to heal rather than make war.": "一位战争领域的教士多年来一直在与她的神庙的敌人发生冲突。但有一天，她漫步到一片阳光灿烂的草地上，她的神曾经在那里为世界的苦难流下了慈悲之泪。牧师喝下沼泽地的小溪，对所有人都充满了怜悯，她现在拥有了生命领域的力量，准备治疗而不是发动战争。",
	"Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.": "工匠们使用各种工具来引导他们的奥术力量。为了施展法术，工匠可能会使用炼金术士的用品来制造强力的灵药，使用书法家的用品来刻画力量的标志，或者使用工匠的工具来制作临时的符咒。工匠的魔力与他们的工具和天赋息息相关，很少有其他角色能像工匠那样为一项工作制造出合适的工具。",
	"Throughout the D&D multiverse, artificers create inventions and magic items of peace and war. Many lives have been brightened or saved because of the work of kind artificers, but countless lives have also been lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by certain artificers' creations.": "在整个D&D多元宇宙中，工匠们创造了和平和战争的发明和魔法物品。由于善良的工匠的工作，许多人的生命得到了照亮或拯救，但也有无数人因为某些工匠的创造物所释放的大规模破坏而丧生。",
	"In the Forgotten Realms, the island of Lantan is home to many artificers, and in the world of Dragonlance, tinker gnomes are often members of this class. The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks of the world of Greyhawk have inspired some folk to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, various nations employ artificers to keep airships and other wondrous devices operational.": "在《被遗忘的领域》中，兰坦岛是许多工匠的家园，而在《龙之谷》的世界中，工匠地精往往是这个阶层的成员。灰鹰世界壁垒峰的奇特技术激发了一些人走上工匠之路，而在奥秘城，各个国家雇佣工匠来维持飞艇和其他奇妙装置的运行。",
	"Artificers in the City of Sigil share discoveries from throughout the multiverse, and from there, the gnome artificer Vi runs a cosmos-spanning business that hires adventurers to fix problems that others deem unfixable. In Vi's home world, Eberron, magic is harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society, largely as a result of the wondrous ingenuity of artificers.": "Sigil城的工匠们分享来自整个多元宇宙的发现，在那里，地精工匠Vi经营着一家横跨宇宙的企业，雇佣冒险者来解决别人认为无法解决的问题。在维的家乡艾伯伦，魔法被作为一种科学形式加以利用，并在整个社会中部署，这主要是由于工匠们的奇妙的智慧的结果。",
	"Artificers invent cutting-edge problems, then try to solve them—loudly and often with collateral damage.": "工匠们发明了最先进的问题，然后试图解决这些问题--大声地，而且经常有附带的损害。",
	"The barbarian class receives new features and subclasses in this section.": "野蛮人类别在本节中获得了新的特征和子类。",
	"Unlike the features in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description.

Your search for improvement is a consuming passion, and you draw on the expertise of the masters who've come before you as you work to perfect your form.": "你认为决斗是一个值得骄傲的传统，是对技巧和智慧的考验，为那些能够在尊重艺术的同时击败敌人的人带来荣誉。你对改进的追求是一种消耗性的激情，你在努力完善自己的形式时，借鉴了前辈们的专业知识。",

These patrons provide a strong binding element: an individual or an organization that unites a party as a team in service to a greater purpose. A group patron can help set the tone of your party's entire campaign. For example, a group whose patron is an academic institution is likely to have a very different story from a group that serves a military. A patron can influence characters' relationships, their backstories, and the types of dangers they face.": "每个冒险团都因其所进行的任务和其成员共同面对的危险而结合在一起。本章提供了另一种将你的队伍捆绑在一起的方法：一个团体赞助人。这些赞助人提供了一个强有力的约束元素：一个个人或一个组织将一个团队团结起来，为一个更大的目标服务。一个团体赞助人可以帮助确定你的政党整个运动的基调。例如，一个团体的赞助人是一个学术机构，它的故事可能与一个为军队服务的团体有很大不同。赞助人可以影响角色的关系，他们的背景故事，以及他们所面临的危险类型。",
	"The following sections present several group patron options. The description of each patron provides an overview of the types of organizations the group patron represents, perks of membership, and quests the patron encourages adventurers to undertake.": "下面的章节介绍了几个团体赞助人的选择。每个赞助人的描述都概述了该团体赞助人所代表的组织类型、会员的好处以及该赞助人鼓励冒险者进行的任务。",
	" With the input of your DM, you can customize these patrons to reflect specific establishments in your campaign world or to serve as a launchpad tailored for organizations of your design. For example, the guild group patron could represent the Harpers or the Zhentarim of the Forgotten Realms, the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild in Eberron, or a homebrew league of caravan guards. Or perhaps a criminal syndicate, military force, or other category of patron better fits the party's goals. Choose and customize the group patron that works best for your party and the types of adventures you want to explore.": " 根据你的DM的意见，你可以定制这些赞助人，以反映你的战役世界中的特定机构，或者作为为你设计的组织量身定做的启动平台。例如，公会团体赞助人可以代表被遗忘的领域中的哈珀人（Harpers）或赞塔林（Zhentarim），埃伯龙（Eberron）的崖顶冒险者公会，或自制的商队守卫联盟。也可能是犯罪集团、军事力量或其他类别的赞助人更适合聚会的目标。选择并定制最适合你的队伍和你想探索的冒险类型的团体赞助人。",

	" The DM should not feel limited to providing only the perks noted in each group patron's description. Patrons give a party access to solutions and support they wouldn't have otherwise, and a patron can use their varied resources to guide their agents or prepare them for greater adventures.": " DM不应该感到局限于只提供每个团体赞助人描述中提到的好处。赞助人可以让一方获得他们无法获得的解决方案和支持，而且赞助人可以利用他们的各种资源来指导他们的代理人，或者为他们准备更大的冒险。",
	" A more hands-off patron can still significantly motivate your group. Maybe you seek adventures based on what pleases your patron, possibly earning status and rewards within your organization. An academy, for example, might not organize particular missions, so you hunt down ancient artifacts knowing that your patron will reward you for bringing them back. You have the freedom to chart your own destiny, while letting the patron shape the nature of your group and the adventures you undertake.": " 一个更不负责任的赞助人仍然可以大大激励你的团体。也许你会根据你的赞助人的喜好来寻求冒险，可能会在你的组织中获得地位和奖励。例如，一个学院可能不会组织特定的任务，所以你会猎取古代文物，知道你的赞助人会奖励你把它们带回来。你可以自由地规划自己的命运，同时让赞助人决定你的团体和你的冒险的性质。",
	"Here are some of the most likely patrons for an adventuring group. Presented in alphabetical order, these patrons can serve as inspiration for you to create patrons of your own:": "以下是一些最可能成为冒险团赞助人的人。按字母顺序排列，这些赞助人可以作为你创建自己的赞助人的灵感。",

	"Any assemblage of scholars and truth-seekers can function as an academy. Generally, an academy unites a network of learned individuals, allowing them to share their knowledge, further their research, and support common goals. Passing on wisdom to the next generation is part of an academy's mandate, but members find opportunities to undertake far-flung research expeditions—only so much can be learned in libraries, after all. An academy's focus can be broad or singular, artistic or scientific, mundane or magical. For every topic with unexplored possibilities, an academy seeks to plumb its depths or elevate its study.": "任何学者和寻求真理者的集合体都可以作为一个学术机构发挥作用。一般来说，学院将有识之士的网络联合起来，使他们能够分享知识，推进研究，并支持共同的目标。将智慧传给下一代是学院的任务之一，但成员也有机会进行远距离的研究考察--毕竟在图书馆里可以学到很多东西。一个学院的重点可以是广泛的或单一的，艺术的或科学的，平凡的或神奇的。对于每一个具有未开发可能性的主题，学院都会寻求其深度或提升其研究水平。",

	"The academy pays for the work you do on its behalf. The nature of your employment influences your compensation. On average, the academy pays each member of your group 1 gp per day, or enough to sustain a modest lifestyle. Alternatively, you receive a bounty (at least 250 gp) for each artifact or relevant discovery you bring back from your adventures and donate to the academy.": "学院为你代表它所做的工作支付报酬。你的工作性质影响着你的报酬。平均来说，学院每天付给你们每个人1个金币，或者足够维持一个小规模的生活。另外，你从冒险中带回来的每件文物或相关发现都会得到一笔赏金（至少250戈比），并捐赠给学院。",
	"Each member of your group has identification denoting your affiliation with the academy. This association carries clout in scholarly or artistic circles. The academy also secures documentation, letters of introduction, and traveling papers if your work requires them. Such documents grant you special status, such as access to forbidden regions or neutral standing in embattled areas. Such identification isn't always a boon, though. In a land frequently plundered by foreigners, your documents could mark you as nothing more than aggrandized looters to some.": "你们小组的每个成员都有身份证明，表示你们与学术界的关系。这个协会在学术界或艺术界具有影响力。如果你的工作需要，学院还能保证文件、介绍信和旅行证件。这些文件赋予你特殊的地位，如进入禁区或在争斗地区保持中立地位。不过，这样的身份证明并不总是一个福音。在这片经常被外国人掠夺的土地上，你的证件可能会使你在某些人眼里只是一个被夸大的掠夺者。",
	"Research is part of your group's job, but your patron also has abundant resources to facilitate such efforts. You can call in a favor to delegate the work of researching lore (a downtime activity described in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} and {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}) to a colleague, contact, librarian, or research assistant. You're responsible for covering expenses incurred as part of this research, and the DM determines its success or failure.": "研究是你们小组工作的一部分，但你的赞助人也有丰富的资源来促进这种工作。你可以叫人帮忙，把研究传说的工作（{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}和{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}中描述的停工活动）委托给同事、联系人、图书管理员或研究助理。你要负责支付这项研究所产生的费用，而DM则决定其成败。",

Additionally, you can consult with the faculty of your academy as the experts in various fields.": "学院拥有图书馆、博物馆、记录库和培训设施，你可以利用它们来推进你的工作。你可以向学院成员求助，以获得公众无法获得的资源--危险的遗物或魔法物品、法术书、装备等等。此外，你可以向你的学院的教员咨询，他们是各个领域的专家。",
	"Because you're associated with the academy, you receive a discount on any education you wish to pursue. When you undergo training as a downtime activity (as described in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} or {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}), you pay half the normal cost, assuming the academy teaches that subject. Training in languages, musical instruments, and other tools is also available, at the DM's discretion. In addition, you can gain proficiency in the {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, {@skill Nature}, or {@skill Religion} skills by this method, as if you were learning a language. A character can learn only one of these skills in this way.": "因为你与学院有联系，你在任何你想接受的教育上都能得到折扣。当你作为停工活动接受训练时（如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}或{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}所述），你支付正常费用的一半，前提是学院教授该科目。语言、乐器和其他工具的训练也是可以的，由DM决定。此外，你可以通过这种方法获得{@skill Arcana}、{@skill History}、{@skill Nature}或{@skill Religion}技能的熟练度，就像你在学习语言一样。一个角色只能用这种方法学习其中一个技能。",
	"How much autonomy you have in choosing your missions and how often you're expected to perform on the academy's behalf depends largely on your place in the institution's hierarchy. As students, new professors, or support staff, you aid the work of a senior professor or entire department. If you are further along in your career, you have your own goals and assistants, but you still take on assignments to further the goals of esteemed experts, deans, or the academy as a whole. In any of these cases, a specific contact manages your relationship to the academy.": "你在选择任务方面有多大的自主权，以及你被期望代表学院执行任务的频率，很大程度上取决于你在机构的等级制度中的位置。作为学生、新教授或辅助人员，你们协助资深教授或整个部门的工作。如果你在职业生涯中走得更远，你有自己的目标和助手，但你仍然接受任务，促进受人尊敬的专家、院长或整个学术界的目标。在上述任何一种情况下，都有一个具体的联系人来管理你与学术界的关系。",

Alternatively, you might work to further the academy's efforts in another way, perhaps related to security or funding.": "如果你有一个学院作为你的赞助人，你很可能正在从事学术追求或支持正在从事学术追求的人。考虑做一个有前途的学生或教员的新成员。虽然你有一个适度的课程负担，你在幕后处理（或利用各种停工活动），但你的主要兴趣是帮助你的联系人进行研究。另外，你可能会以另一种方式努力推动学院的工作，也许与安全或资金有关。",

Rival mercenary companies, armed resistance fighters, and monsters drawn to the presence of bloodshed also present familiar threats.": "一个军事单位的广泛工作要求既要有力量又要有微妙。你的任务有可能打破最近与对手国家建立的脆弱的和平，使多个国家重新陷入战争。或者，你的团队的任务会让你在积极的交战中与对手的战斗人员对抗，因为你会影响战争的努力。敌对的雇佣兵公司、武装抵抗战士和被血腥场面吸引的怪物也会带来熟悉的威胁。",

Some religious orders also hunt and destroy fiends, undead, or other beings they consider abominations, seeking to rid the word of their influence. Others root out heretics, real or imagined, to demonstrate the primacy of their deity.": "你为你的宗教组织提供的服务取决于你所服务的神明和你的党派的能力。不管怎么说，宗教组织都会受到敌对信仰的反对，这些敌人与你的组织之间的竞争就像你们各自的神之间的冲突一样。一些宗教团体还猎杀和消灭恶魔、亡灵或其他他们认为可憎的生物，寻求摆脱他们的影响。另一些教团则根除异端，不管是真实的还是想象的，以显示其神性的首要地位。",

When choosing or creating a sovereign to serve, consider whether that leader commands a government organization or another faction. While this section assumes your patron is the head of a country or other national body, they could oversee a powerful private division, a cult of personality, or an elaborate expedition. Also, consider the scale of your patron's organization. While serving as spies engaging in international intrigues could lead to world-changing escapades, being fixers for the mayor of a struggling town offers a personal connection to a place and its people.": "从广义上讲，君主的范围从政府首脑到强大的私人机构的领导人。女王、首领、苏丹和拉贾是那些赞助冒险家队伍的强大个人的现成选择。那些有望成为这些人的人--比如狡猾的参议员、皇室继承人或有影响力的名人--也可以担任君主的角色。在选择或创建一个服务的君主时，要考虑这个领导者是指挥一个政府组织还是其他派别。虽然本节假设你的赞助人是一个国家或其他国家机构的领导人，但他们可以监督一个强大的私人部门、一个个人崇拜或一个精心策划的探险队。此外，还要考虑你的赞助人组织的规模。作为从事国际阴谋活动的间谍，可能会导致改变世界的逃亡，而为一个挣扎中的城镇的市长做修理工，则会提供与一个地方及其人民的个人联系。",

	"Each player has options when it comes to choosing a character race, class, and background, though you may restrict certain options that are deemed unsuitable for the campaign. If there are multiple players in the group, you should encourage them to choose different classes so that the adventuring party has a range of abilities. It's less important that the party include multiple backgrounds, as sometimes it's fun to play an all-soldier party or a troupe of adventuring entertainers. The backgrounds they choose define who their characters were before becoming adventurers and also include roleplaying hooks in the form of ideals, bonds, and flaws—things you ought to know. For example, if a player chooses the criminal background, one of the options for the character's bond is, \"I'm trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.\" If that's the character's bond, you should work with the player to decide who that generous benefactor is and build relevant storylines into the larger campaign.": "在选择角色的种族、等级和背景方面，每个玩家都有选择权，不过你可以限制某些被认为不适合活动的选项。如果小组中有多个玩家，你应该鼓励他们选择不同的等级，以便冒险队伍有一系列的能力。队伍中是否包括多种背景并不重要，因为有时扮演一个全战士的队伍或一个冒险艺人的剧团也很有趣。他们选择的背景定义了他们的角色在成为冒险家之前是谁，还包括以理想、纽带和缺陷为形式的角色扮演钩子--你应该知道的东西。例如，如果一个玩家选择了犯罪背景，那么角色的纽带选项之一就是：\"我正在努力偿还我欠一位慷慨的恩人的旧债。\" 如果这是角色的纽带，你应该和玩家一起决定谁是那个慷慨的恩人，并在更大的活动中建立相关的故事情节。",
	"During session zero, your role is to let the players build the characters they want and to help them come up with explanations for how their characters came together to form an adventuring party. It can be helpful to assume that the characters know each other and have some sort of history together, however brief that history might be. Here are some questions you can ask the players as they create characters to get a sense of the party's relationships:": "在第零次会议期间，你的角色是让玩家建立他们想要的角色，并帮助他们解释他们的角色是如何走到一起组成一个冒险队伍的。假设这些角色彼此认识，并且有某种共同的历史，不管这段历史有多短暂，都会有帮助。这里有一些问题，你可以在玩家创建角色时问他们，以了解队伍的关系。",

	" If the players are having trouble coming up with a story for how their characters met, they may choose an option from the Party Origin table or let a {@dice d6} roll choose it for them.

For example, if the characters came together to overcome a common foe, the identity of this enemy needs to be determined. If a funeral gathered the group, the identity of the deceased and each character's relationship to them will need to be fleshed out.": " 如果玩家在想他们的角色是如何相遇的问题上有困难，他们可以从聚会起源表中选择一个选项，或者让{@dice d6}卷来为他们选择。你应该花部分时间帮助玩家充实这些细节。例如，如果这些角色是为了战胜一个共同的敌人而走到一起的，那么这个敌人的身份就需要确定。如果一个葬礼聚集了这群人，那么就需要充实死者的身份以及每个角色与他们的关系。",

	"Once you and the players have acknowledged the terms of the game's social contract and agreed to uphold them, the conversation can segue into a discussion about soft and hard limits. There are many ways to mediate this discussion, and you might want to do some research to find an approach that might work well for your group. For purposes of this explanation, these terms are described as follows:": "一旦你和玩家都承认了游戏的社会契约条款，并同意坚持这些条款，对话就可以转入关于软限制和硬限制的讨论。有许多方法来调解这一讨论，你可能想做一些研究，找到一种可能对你的小组很有效的方法。在本解释中，这些术语描述如下。",
	"A {@b hard limit} is a threshold that should never be crossed.": "A{@b hard limit}是一个永远不应该跨越的门槛。",
	" Every member of the group has soft and hard limits, and it behooves everyone in the group to know what they are. Make sure everyone at the table is comfortable with how this discussion takes place. Players might not want to discuss their limits aloud around the table, especially if they're new to roleplaying games or haven't spent a lot of time with certain other members of the group. One way to alleviate such discomfort is to encourage the players to share their limits privately with you and allow you to present them without attribution to the whole group. For example, the players could write their limits on index cards for you to read aloud. However these limits are presented, it would be useful for you or one of the players to compile the limits into one list that can be shared with the whole group. Keep in mind that any discussion about limits should be treated with care—even sharing a person's limits can be a very painful experience, and this conversation should be handled with respect.": " 小组的每个成员都有软性和硬性的限制，小组中的每个人都应该知道它们是什么。确保桌子上的每个人都能适应这种讨论的方式。玩家可能不想在桌子周围大声讨论他们的极限，特别是如果他们是角色扮演游戏的新手，或者没有和小组的某些其他成员相处过很长时间。缓解这种不适的方法之一是鼓励玩家与你私下分享他们的极限，并允许你在不向全组人说明的情况下提出。例如，选手们可以把他们的限制写在索引卡上，让你大声朗读。不管这些限制是如何被提出来的，你或其中一个参与者将这些限制汇编成一个列表，并与整个小组分享，这将是很有用的。请记住，任何关于限制的讨论都应该被谨慎对待--即使是分享一个人的限制也可能是非常痛苦的经历，这种对话应该被尊重地处理。",
	" Common in-game limits include—but are not limited to—themes or scenes of sex, exploitation, racial profiling, slavery, violence toward children and animals, gratuitous swearing, and intra-party romance. Common out-of-game limits include unwanted physical contact, dice-sharing, dice-throwing, shouting, vulgarity, rules lawyering, distracting use of cell phones, and generally disrespectful behavior. ": " 常见的游戏内限制包括--但不限于--性、剥削、种族定性、奴役、对儿童和动物的暴力、无端的脏话和党内的恋情等主题或场景。常见的游戏外限制包括不必要的身体接触、分享骰子、扔骰子、大喊大叫、粗俗、规则律师、分散注意力的手机使用和一般不尊重的行为。",
	" The discussion of limits is important because DMs and players can have phobias or triggers that others might not be aware of. Any in-game topic or theme that makes a member of the gaming group feel unsafe or uncomfortable should be avoided. If a topic or theme makes one or more players nervous but they give you consent to include it in-game, incorporating it should be handled with care, and you must be ready to veer away from such topics and themes quickly.": " 对限制的讨论很重要，因为管理人和玩家可能有其他人可能不知道的恐惧症或触发器。任何让游戏小组成员感到不安全或不舒服的游戏中的话题或主题都应该避免。如果一个话题或主题让一个或多个玩家感到紧张，但他们同意你将其纳入游戏中，则应谨慎处理，你必须准备好迅速偏离此类话题和主题。",
	" While session zero is the perfect place to start this discussion, it might not be the only time limits are addressed. Someone might cross a line and need to be reminded of a limit, or someone might not think to include some of their limits in the initial discussion. Players can also discover new limits as the campaign unfolds. Make a plan to check in with the group to make sure the list of hard and soft limits is up to date, and remind everyone to revisit this list often in case it changes. ": " 虽然零点会议是开始这种讨论的完美场所，但它可能不是唯一涉及限制的时间。有人可能会越过一条线，需要提醒他注意某个限制，或者有人可能没有想到在最初的讨论中包括他们的一些限制。随着活动的展开，玩家们也可以发现新的限制。制定一个计划，与小组一起检查，以确保硬性和软性限制的清单是最新的，并提醒大家经常重温这个清单，以防它发生变化。",
	"In addition to shaping the game around the characters in the adventuring party, you should be prepared to customize the game to suit the players' tastes. The \"{@book Know Your Players|DMG|0|Know Your Players}\" section in the introduction of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} provides some guidance for doing so, based on known player archetypes.

	"This puzzle explores how to use groups of objects to disguise a message. So long as your groups can be arranged in a logical order (like the gems being arranged alphabetically in this puzzle), all you must do is adjust the number of items to correspond to a particular letter of the alphabet. Alternatively, perhaps another organizing principle orders your groups. For example, tombstones that feature varying numbers of skulls might be arranged by dates, while stacks of books might be ordered by shared page-counts. These details can be easy to miss, though, so make sure you present a riddle or other signpost to make sure your players notice there's a puzzle at hand.": "这道谜题探讨了如何利用物体群来伪装信息。只要你的组别能够按照逻辑顺序排列（比如这个谜题中的宝石是按照字母顺序排列的），你所要做的就是调整物品的数量来对应某个特定的字母。另外，也许另一个组织原则也能为你的组别排序。例如，以不同数量的骷髅头为特征的墓碑可以按日期排列，而一摞书可以按共同的页数排列。不过，这些细节很容易被忽略，所以要确保你提出一个谜语或其他路标，以确保你的玩家注意到有一个谜题在手。",

	"Once the goblin has the characters' attention, it provides the first riddle, then waits for the party to venture down a passage of its choice.

Alternatively, the response to the guard's number might be any word with the same number of letters as that number—for example, \"five\" has four letters, making \"duck\" or \"smog\" suitable responses. The more your puzzle plays with numbers as words rather than digits, the more challenging it's likely to be.": "这个谜题之所以具有挑战性，部分原因在于它误导了玩家，让他们以为自己听到了一个数学方程式。为了找出答案，他们必须首先克服自己的假设。这个谜题的一个简单版本可能是计算警卫提供的任何类型的单词中的字母，然后用这个数字来回答。另外，对警卫提供的数字的回答可以是任何与该数字的字母数相同的词--例如，\"5 \"有四个字母，因此 \"鸭子 \"或 \"烟雾 \"是合适的回答。你的谜题越是把数字当作单词而不是数字来玩，就越有可能具有挑战性。",

Four of these tiles have fallen off and lie strewn upon the floor, which bears the following inscription:": "当你进入这个六边形的房间时，门在你身后砰然关闭。四面墙都是马赛克，每一面都描绘了四种元素之一的破坏力。四个九英尺高的元素石雕在紧闭的门对面的墙上。雕像上方是一排方形瓷砖，上面画有三角形的符号。其中四块瓷砖已经脱落，散落在地板上，地板上有以下铭文。",
