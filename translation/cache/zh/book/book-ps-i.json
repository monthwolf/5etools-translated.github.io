	"Clouds of purple and red shroud the sky above the forbidding mountains of the Geier Reach, never allowing the sun's full light to shine on the ground below. The jagged spires of Maurer Estate jut up from the peaks, keeping silent watch over the isolated valley. Stoic and enduring, the people of Stensia huddle in their stone-crafted villages—Shadowgrange, Krezk, Lammas—built against the mountainsides. Wisps of thick fog twine amid the trunks of black pines in the Somberwald, thick bogs suck dead trees slowly down into their murky depths, and dusky pastureland provides scant sustenance to flocks of scrawny sheep.": "紫色和红色的云层笼罩着盖尔山脉的天空，从不允许太阳的全部光芒照耀到下面的地面。毛勒庄园参差不齐的尖顶从山峰上突起，默默地监视着这个与世隔绝的山谷。斯滕西亚的人民坚忍不拔，蜷缩在靠山坡建造的石制村庄里--沙多格、克雷兹克、兰玛斯。Somberwald的黑松树干中缠绕着几缕浓雾，厚厚的沼泽地将死树慢慢地吸进阴暗的深处，昏暗的牧场为成群的瘦羊提供了稀少的养料。",
	"The lord of this bleak, remote part of Stensia's outland valleys is Strefan Maurer, who drank angel's blood alongside Edgar Markov and Olivia Voldaren centuries ago. His bloodline is small and mostly irrelevant to the larger world, but in the outland valleys of Stensia, he is the ultimate master. Avacyn and Sigarda offer scant hope to his grim subjects. Abandoned by their angels and hunted by vampires, all the Stensians can do is endure the unending dusk.": "斯滕西亚外围山谷这个荒凉、偏远地区的领主是斯特雷凡-毛勒，他在几个世纪前与埃德加-马可夫和奥利维亚-沃尔达伦一起喝过天使的血。他的血统很小，而且与更大的世界无关，但在斯滕西亚的内陆谷地，他是终极主人。阿瓦辛和西加达为他严峻的臣民提供了很少的希望。被他们的天使抛弃，被吸血鬼追杀，斯滕西亚人所能做的就是忍受无尽的黄昏。",
	"By the time Plane Shift: Zendikar saw the light of day, the game and story of Magic: The Gathering had moved on from Zendikar and started the tale of Shadows over Innistrad. I had already finished writing The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Innistrad, at the same time that Curse of Strahd, a horror-themed adventure for Dungeons & Dragons, was on the shelves. All this meant that I turned my attention pretty quickly to the next installment, Plane Shift: Innistrad!": "当Plane Shift: Zendikar的时候，《魔法：集会》的游戏和故事已经从Zendikar转移到了Innistrad阴影的故事上了。我已经写完了《魔法：集会的艺术--Innistrad》，与此同时，《龙与地下城》的恐怖主题冒险《Curse of Strahd》也上架了。所有这些都意味着我很快就把注意力转向了下一部作品--《位面转移》。Innistrad!",
	"The starting point for this document was The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Innistrad. Consider that book to be a useful resource in creating your Innistrad campaign, but not strictly necessary. An abundance of lore about Innistrad can be found on the Magic website. This document is designed to help you turn the book's adventure hooks and story seeds into a resource for your campaign with a minimum of changes to the fifth edition D&D rules.": "本文件的出发点是《魔法的艺术：集会--Innistrad》。考虑到这本书是创建你的Innistrad战役的一个有用的资源，但不是严格意义上的必须。关于Innistrad的大量传说可以在魔法网站上找到。本文件旨在帮助你将书中的冒险钩子和故事种子转化为你的战役资源，并对第五版D&D规则进行最少的修改。",
	"This document also contains guidelines for adapting the Curse of Strahd adventure to set it in Innistrad. With a bit of creative improvisation, these tips should get you on your way.": "本文件也包含改編「斯特拉赫特的詛咒」冒險的指引，以便將它設定在因斯特拉德。只要有一点创造性的即兴发挥，这些提示应该可以让你上路。",
	"On the plane of Innistrad, horrors stalk the shadows and scratch at doors in the night. Humanity is beset on all sides: vampires thirst for human blood, werewolves live for the thrill of the hunt, the restless spirits of the dead haunt the living, and no corpse is safe from reanimation at the hands of cruel necromancers or cunning scientists. Only their grim determination—and their staunch faith in the protection of their patron archangel, Avacyn—has allowed humans to survive in this nightmarish realm.": "在Innistrad星球上，恐怖在阴影中徘徊，在夜里抓门。人类受到四面八方的困扰：吸血鬼渴求人血，狼人以狩猎为生，不安分的亡灵困扰着活人，没有一具尸体能在残忍的死灵法师或狡猾的科学家手中安全复活。只有他们严峻的决心，以及他们对大天使长阿瓦辛的保护的坚定信念，才使人类能够在这个噩梦般的领域生存。",
	"The people of Innistrad are surrounded by monsters. Almost without exception, anything that is not human, whether it's a rat or an angel, is a potential enemy. Even the traditional allies of humanity—from angels and gryffs to herons and hounds—are unreliable at best, as the madness that grips the angels seems to seep into every living thing. And at the same time, humanity's age-old enemies grow ever more dangerous.": "Innistrad的人们被怪兽所包围。几乎毫无例外，任何非人类的东西，无论是老鼠还是天使，都是潜在的敌人。即使是人类的传统盟友--从天使和格里夫到苍鹭和猎犬--充其量也是不可靠的，因为笼罩在天使身上的疯狂似乎已经渗入了每一种生物。而与此同时，人类的宿敌也变得越来越危险。",
	"The specific horrors that the people of Innistrad fear most are all reflections of humanity's darker nature. Werewolves are a living embodiment of the secret rage and violence that hide in the human heart. Vampires are the bodily manifestation of carnal desire, hedonistic cravings, and bloodlust. Zombies and geists—the restless spirits of the dead—paint the eventual future of all people in the starkest terms, underlining the grim truths of human mortality. Demons are the unholy inversion of humanity's spiritual longings—the shadow side of the angels' brightness.": "Innistrad的人们最害怕的具体恐怖行为都是人类黑暗本质的反映。狼人是隐藏在人类内心深处的秘密愤怒和暴力的生动体现。吸血鬼是肉欲、享乐主义的渴望和嗜血的身体表现。僵尸和地精--不安分的亡灵--以最严酷的方式描绘了所有人的最终未来，强调了人类死亡的严峻事实。恶魔是人类精神渴望的邪恶反面--天使光明的阴影面。",
	"Still, the most dreadful creatures of Innistrad lurk within human towns and cities, pursuing their twisted schemes and unholy desires in the heart of civilization. These are the humans that have been consumed by Innistrad's darkness. Sinister cultists give themselves over to demons and other dark forces. Depraved necromancers raise the dead to do their bidding. Obsessive scholars pry into secrets best left hidden. Crazed scientists toy with forces of life and death in their effort to create artificial life or harness the energy that remains in the spirits of the dead. And even among the common folk—on Innistrad as on every plane—some simply give in to selfish desires and violent rage, killing with knife and garrote rather than sorcery.": "尽管如此，因斯泰德最可怕的生物还是潜伏在人类的城镇中，在文明的中心追求他们扭曲的计划和不洁的欲望。这些是被因斯泰德的黑暗所吞噬的人类。邪恶的崇拜者将自己交给了恶魔和其他黑暗力量。堕落的死灵法师使死人复活，为他们服务。执着的学者们探究最好被隐藏的秘密。疯狂的科学家们玩弄生命和死亡的力量，努力创造人造生命或利用残留在死者灵魂中的能量。甚至在因斯特拉德的普通民众中，就像在每个星球上一样，有些人只是屈服于自私的欲望和暴力的愤怒，用刀和绞刑具而不是巫术杀人。",
	"Humanity is not without protectors in this nightmare land, and the foremost of those have always been the angels. Led by the glorious archangel Avacyn, the hosts of angels is few in number but has long stood with the people of Innistrad to face the horrors of the night.": "在这片噩梦般的土地上，人类并非没有保护者，而其中最重要的一直是天使。在光荣的大天使阿瓦辛的带领下，天使的队伍人数不多，但长期以来一直与因斯特拉德的人民站在一起，共同面对黑夜的恐怖。",
	"Except in rare cases where the angels directly involve themselves in combat with monsters, their power is mediated through the Church of Avacyn, which serves as both spiritual and temporal authority in the four provinces of Innistrad. The priests of the church perform ritual blessings on the faithful and their homes to ward off evil, and the church's soldiers and inquisitors have long hunted vampires and werewolves that prey on the people in their charge.": "除了在极少数情况下，天使会直接参与到与怪物的战斗中，他们的力量是通过阿瓦辛教会来调解的，该教会在因斯特拉德的四个省份中既是精神权威，又是世俗权威。教会的牧师对信徒和他们的家园进行仪式性的祝福，以抵御邪恶，而教会的士兵和审问者长期以来一直在猎杀那些捕食他们所负责的人的吸血鬼和狼人。",
	"But that was before Avacyn went mad. Without warning, the searing fury of the archangel—usually reserved for the greatest foes of humanity—was turned on villages full of seemingly innocent people. Angels under Avacyn's leadership impaled the innocent on their spears and scoured the earth with celestial fire. Convinced that the sins of humanity had brought down Avacyn's wrath, the church took up the archangel's cause and sought to purge all sin through inquisition and execution.": "但那是在阿瓦辛发狂之前。在没有任何警告的情况下，大天使的灼热怒火--通常留给人类最大的敌人--转向了满是看似无辜者的村庄。在阿瓦辛的领导下，天使们用他们的长矛刺死了无辜的人，用天火烧毁了大地。教会确信是人类的罪孽导致了阿瓦辛的愤怒，因此接受了大天使的事业，并试图通过宗教裁判和处决来清除所有的罪恶。",
	"With even the angels and the church turned against humanity, few were left to take up arms against Innistrad's evils. Here and there, renegade cathars disobeyed the mandate of the church and continued to hunt vampires and werewolves instead of punishing the innocent. But increasingly, the common folk—farmers with their pitchforks, smiths with their hammers, and retired soldiers taking battle-worn swords down from above the mantle—discovered new reserves of strength and resiliency to stand against the horrors of the darkness, even when those horrors were parish priests and holy knights.": "由于连天使和教会都背叛了人类，很少有人能拿起武器对抗因斯特拉德的邪恶。在这里和那里，叛逆的天主教徒不服从教会的命令，继续猎杀吸血鬼和狼人，而不是惩罚无辜的人。但是，越来越多的普通人--拿着干草叉的农民、拿着锤子的铁匠，以及从衣钵之上拿着饱经战火的剑的退役士兵--发现了新的力量和韧性储备，以对抗黑暗的恐怖，即使这些恐怖是教区牧师和神圣骑士。",
	"Innistrad's population is mostly human, and player characters in an Innistrad campaign should be human in most circumstances. However, the humans of Kessig are different in many respects from those of Gavony, and Nephalia's urban culture is very distinct from the shadow-draped land of Stensia. Diversity among player characters comes not from race, but from each character's home province.": "Innistrad的人口大部分是人类，在大多数情况下，Innistrad战役中的玩家角色应该是人类。然而，凯西格的人类在许多方面与加沃尼的人类不同，而奈法利亚的城市文化与斯滕西亚的阴影之地非常不同。玩家角色之间的多样性不是来自种族，而是来自每个角色的家乡省份。",
	"Characters of any class can be found in Innistrad, though some classes are rarer than others. The organizations and character types noted below are described in more detail on the following pages.": "任何等级的角色都可以在Innistrad中找到，尽管有些等级比其他等级更稀有。下面提到的组织和角色类型在下面几页中会有更详细的描述。",
	"{@class Barbarian||Barbarians} are not a common sight in Innistrad. Some cathars draw on the power of divine fury (see the Lightning Mauler card in Avacyn Restored). The remotest regions of the Somberwald, the Ulvenwald, and the Geier Reach might also be home to more traditional barbarians.": "{@class Barbarian||Barbarians}在因斯特拉德并不常见。有些卡瑟尔人借助于神怒的力量（见《阿瓦辛复生》中的闪电猛击者卡）。桑伯瓦尔德（Somberwald）、乌尔文瓦尔德（Ulvenwald）和盖尔河（Geier Reach）的最偏远地区也可能是更多传统野蛮人的家园。",
	"{@class Bard||Bards} are also rare on Innistrad. A springsage—an Avacynian archmage dedicated to healing and renewal—could conceivably be a bard.": "{@class Bard||Bards}在Innistrad也很罕见。可以想象，一个阿瓦西尼亚的大法师，致力于治疗和更新，可以成为一个吟游诗人。",
	"{@class Cleric||Clerics} populate the ranks of the church hierarchy and many cathar orders.": "{@class Cleric||Clerics}充斥着教会等级制度和许多加尔各答会的队伍。",
	"{@class Druid||Druids} can be found as springsages or as the \"witches\" known as forcemages, who make pacts with nature spirits.": "{@class Druid||Druids}可以作为弹簧法师或被称为 \"巫师 \"的人被发现，他们与自然界的精神签订契约。",
	"{@class Fighter||Fighters} fill all the usual roles on Innistrad, as soldiers, cathars, militia captains, town guards, and so on.": "{@class Fighter||Fighters}充当Innistrad上所有常见的角色，如士兵、Cathars、民兵队长、城镇守卫等等。",
	"{@class Monk||Monks} are rare. A monk is probably a member of the church hierarchy, and in fact is most likely to be a monk in the church's definition—a wandering priest.": "{@class Monk||Monks}是罕见的。僧侣可能是教会等级制度的成员，事实上最有可能是教会定义中的僧侣--流浪的牧师。",
	"{@class Paladin||Paladins} fill many of the cathar orders. As the angels' madness and Emrakul's rise change the face of Innistrad, the Order of Saint Traft becomes the home of many \"heretic\" cathars who choose to follow their own conscience rather than the increasingly insane dictates of the church.": "{@class Paladin||Paladins}填补了许多cathar的订单。随着天使的疯狂和艾姆拉库尔的崛起改变了因斯特拉德的面貌，圣特拉夫特骑士团成为许多 \"异端 \"卡萨的家，他们选择遵循自己的良心而不是教会越来越疯狂的指令。",
	"{@class Ranger||Rangers} are particularly common in Kessig, where they operate as hunters, trappers, or guides in the Ulvenwald, or as cathar members of the Quiver of Kessig.": "{@class Ranger||Rangers}在凯西格特别常见，在那里他们作为猎人、捕猎者或向导在乌尔文森林活动，或作为凯西格之箭的卡塔尔成员。",
	"{@class Rogue||Rogues} are most common in Thraben and the cities of Nephalia, engaging in smuggling, thievery, corpse trading, and other unsavory lines of work.": "{@class Rogue||Rogues}在Thraben和Nephalia的城市最常见，从事走私、偷盗、尸体交易和其他不光彩的工作。",
	"{@class Warlock||Warlocks} are found primarily in cults of madness (with a Great Old One as patron), demon cults such as the Skirsdag, or witches' covens. A warlock who belongs to the Skirsdag might be a respected member of the church hierarchy, feigning the blessings of Avacynian clergy.": "{@class Warlock||Warlocks}主要存在于疯狂崇拜（以伟大的老者为赞助人）、恶魔崇拜（如Skirsdag）或女巫的教团。属于斯基尔达格的术士可能是教会等级制度中受人尊敬的成员，佯装得到阿瓦西尼亚神职人员的祝福。",
	"{@class Wizard||Wizards} are often Avacynian archmages, but can also take up more sinister vocations—ghoulcallers, skaberen, necro-alchemists, mad scientists, and cultists.": "{@class Wizard||Wizards}通常是阿瓦西尼亚大法师，但也可以从事更阴险的职业--呼唤者、Skaberen、死灵炼金术士、疯狂科学家和邪教徒。",
	"Innistrad is not a world with a variety of languages, unlike most D&D settings. The people who inhabit the world all speak the same tongue, and the most common monsters—including vampires, werewolves, and geists—speak it as well, since they were once human.": "Innistrad并不是一个拥有各种语言的世界，这与大多数D&D设定不同。居住在这个世界上的人都说同一种语言，最常见的怪物--包括吸血鬼、狼人和地精--也说同一种语言，因为它们曾经是人类。",
	"Ordinarily, all humans learn an additional language, and many backgrounds give access to languages as well—so the easiest way to deal with these extra languages is to ignore them. Humans speak only Common. If a background gives access to a language, the character can choose a tool proficiency instead.": "通常情况下，所有的人类都会学习一种额外的语言，而且许多背景也能获得语言，所以处理这些额外语言的最简单方法就是忽略它们。人类只说普通话。如果一个背景提供了一种语言，该角色可以选择一种工具的熟练程度来代替。",
	"Alternatively, you can diversify the languages of Innistrad. Perhaps the Common tongue is the language of the church, used to facilitate communication among people in different provinces, even as each province has its own language or dialect. Characters might also be able to learn Demonic (spoken by demons and devils), Draconic (spoken by dragons), or Primordial (spoken by elementals).": "另外，你也可以使Innistrad的语言多样化。也许通用语是教会的语言，用于促进不同省份人们之间的交流，即使每个省份都有自己的语言或方言。角色也可以学习恶魔语（由恶魔和魔鬼说的）、德拉康语（由龙说的）或原始语（由元素说的）。",
	"The Avacynian faith is a complex system of beliefs and magical practices intended to protect the humans of Innistrad from the predations of the plane's monsters. Over the centuries, layers of belief and ritual have accreted to this basic core, but as long as Avacyn remained present and sane in the world, the wards of the church remained strong, preventing the utter extinction of the human race.": "阿瓦西尼亚信仰是一个由信仰和魔法实践组成的复杂系统，旨在保护因斯特拉德的人类免受这个星球上的怪物的掠夺。几个世纪以来，信仰和仪式的层层叠叠已经累积到了这个基本的核心，但只要阿瓦辛还在这个世界上存在并保持理智，教会的防护措施就一直很强大，防止人类的彻底灭绝。",
	"Player characters in an Innistrad campaign are likely to be associated with the Church of Avacyn in some capacity. Clerics, druids, fighters, paladins, rangers, and wizards might serve as cathars, inquisitors, or archmages within the broad organization of the church.": "在Innistrad战役中，玩家角色很可能会以某种身份与Avacyn教会有联系。牧师、德鲁伊、战士、圣骑士、游侠和魔法师可能会在教会的广泛组织中担任阴阳师、审问者或大法师。",
	"The church is headed by the Lunarch Council. Consisting of bishops and cathars of the highest ranks, the council continues to struggle to come to terms with the madness of Avacyn and her angels.": "教会由Lunarch理事会领导。理事会由最高级别的主教和阴间人组成，继续努力应对阿瓦辛和她的天使的疯狂行为。",
	"Bishops are the leaders of the spiritual and temporal affairs of the church. Elders govern the parishes that make up each province, combining the administrative responsibilities of a mayor with the religious authority of a minor bishop. Priests attend to the needs of the people at parish churches, village chapels, and crossway altars. All priests have the ability to perform magic, though some are more powerful than others. Most of them focus on the protective blessings that make up the rituals of the church.": "主教是教会精神和世俗事务的领导者。长老们管理着组成各省的教区，将市长的行政职责与小主教的宗教权威结合起来。牧师在教区教堂、乡村小教堂和十字路口的祭坛上满足人们的需求。所有牧师都有施展魔法的能力，尽管有些牧师比其他人更强大。他们中的大多数人专注于构成教堂仪式的保护性祝福。",
	"Monks are wandering priests, not connected to a specific location. Some feel called to minister to those isolated people living beyond the reach of a parish priest, but others take up the life of a monk because they disagree with their superiors in the hierarchy. Some are wild-eyed fanatics or heretical teachers, but many are quiet, peaceful souls with firm convictions that set them apart from the church.": "僧侣是流浪的牧师，不与特定的地点相连。有些人觉得自己被召唤去为那些生活在教区牧师无法触及的孤立人群提供服务，但其他人则是因为不同意他们在等级制度中的上级而选择了修士的生活。有些人是野心勃勃的狂热分子或异端教师，但许多人是安静、平和的灵魂，有坚定的信念，使他们与教会分离。",
	"A player character cleric is probably referred to as a monk in the church hierarchy, having the freedom to move around with no responsibility to any congregation. The acolyte background is ideal for such a character. A cleric's choice of domain might reflect a connection to one of the archangels subservient to Avacyn. The Knowledge domain is particularly associated with Bruna and Flight Alabaster, the Life domain is strongly connected to Sigarda and the Host of Herons, and the War domain is tied to Gisela and Flight Goldnight.": "一个玩家角色的牧师在教会的等级制度中可能被称为僧侣，可以自由活动，对任何教众都没有责任。圣职者的背景对这样的角色来说是理想的。教士对领域的选择可能反映出他与服从于阿瓦辛的某个大天使的联系。知识领域与布鲁纳和阿尔巴斯特飞行团特别相关，生命领域与西格达和苍鹭之主紧密相连，而战争领域则与吉塞拉和金夜飞行团有联系。",
	"Cathars are the soldiers of the Avacynian church, but \"soldiers\" is a broad term encompassing everything from crime-solving investigators to mounted paladins. Some cathar orders are so independent as to be virtually separate sects of the church, while others are tightly bound to the hierarchy of the faith:": "凯撒教徒是阿瓦西尼亚教会的士兵，但 \"士兵 \"是一个广泛的术语，包括从解决犯罪的调查员到骑马的圣骑士。有些凯撒教派非常独立，实际上是教会的独立教派，而其他教派则与信仰的等级制度紧密相连。",
	"The elite cavalry of Innistrad, the Gavony Riders, are extensively trained in mounted combat with swords and lances.": "Innistrad的精英骑兵，Gavony骑兵，接受过广泛的剑和长矛的骑战训练。",
	"The mausoleum guards are the rank-and-file soldiers of the cathars, wielding little magic but making up for it with their numbers.": "陵墓守卫是迦太基的普通士兵，几乎没有魔法，但以其数量来弥补。",
	"Midnight duelists patrol the streets, particularly at night, on the lookout for thieves, vampires, and corpse traders.": "午夜决斗者在街上巡逻，特别是在晚上，寻找小偷、吸血鬼和尸体商人。",
	"Moor chaplains are battlefield faithful who wield magic and weapons with equal skill. Their magic focuses on healing and protection, so they don't usually fight on the front lines.": "摩尔人的牧师是战场上的忠实信徒，他们以同样的技巧挥舞着魔法和武器。他们的魔法专注于治疗和保护，所以他们通常不在前线作战。",
	"Cathars of the parish-blades serve as escorts along the crossways and protect the cathedral in Thraben. They are an elite military force that assembles at the bishops' command.": "教区刀锋的凯撒人在十字路口担任护卫，保护特拉本的大教堂。他们是一支精锐的军队，在主教的指挥下集结。",
	"The Quiver of Kessig is an order recently split off from the parish-blades. Its members specialize in archery and long-range defense, and often guard town walls and church roofs against spirits, vampires, specters, demons, and other flying attackers.": "凯西格的戒律团是最近从教区刀兵中分离出来的一个团体。它的成员擅长射箭和远程防御，并经常守卫城镇的墙壁和教堂的屋顶，以防止鬼魂、吸血鬼、幽灵、恶魔和其他飞行攻击者。",
	"Cathar characters might be clerics (especially moor chaplains), fighters or paladins (especially Gavony Riders, mausoleum guards, midnight duelists, or parish-blades), or rangers (in the Quiver of Kessig). The soldier background works well for cathars.": "凯撒人的角色可能是牧师（尤其是摩尔牧师）、战士或圣骑士（尤其是加沃尼骑士、陵墓守卫、午夜决斗者或伞兵），或者游骑兵（在凯西格的奎尔）。士兵背景对卡瑟尔人很有效。",
	"The Avacynian archmages are gifted spellcasters with the inborn ability to channel some of the divine power of the archangels. Each lineage of the archmages practices unique techniques passed down from master to student for generations, ultimately tracing back to the archangels and Avacyn herself.": "阿瓦西尼亚大法师是有天赋的施法者，他们天生就有能力引导大天使的一些神圣力量。大法师的每一系都有独特的技术，从师傅到学生世代相传，最终追溯到大天使和阿瓦辛本人。",
	"Spearsages, the archmages of Goldnight, use powerful and aggressive spells associated with the sun, channeling blinding rays of holy light and powerful prayers to bolster their allies' speed and courage.": "长矛法师，金夜的大法师，使用与太阳有关的强大而积极的法术，引导刺眼的圣光和强大的祈祷来加强他们的盟友的速度和勇气。",
	"Moonsages, the archmages of Alabaster, are concerned with preserving the Blessed Rest, preventing humans from returning as zombies. They use preventative and warding spells, banishing the undead to the void and making sure graves remain sealed.": "阿拉巴斯特的大法师--月亮法师，关心的是保护受祝福的安息，防止人类作为僵尸返回。他们使用预防和守护法术，将亡灵驱逐到虚空中，确保坟墓保持密封。",
	"Springsages, the archmages of Herons, are healers who use their magic to aid individuals, whole villages, and even the land itself. They act much like wandering priests or monks, traveling the remote reaches to minister to the people and heal the sick.": "泉水法师，鹭岛的大法师，是用他们的魔法来帮助个人、整个村庄，甚至是土地本身的治疗者。他们的行为很像流浪的牧师或僧侣，在偏远的地方旅行，为人们提供服务并治愈疾病。",
	"Historically, {@background Inquisitor|PSI|inquisitors} were cathar detectives who investigated crimes both mundane and supernatural. They were known for traveling to remote parishes plagued by unexplained murders, and for exposing werewolves living among normal humans. During Avacyn's absence, when the archangel was trapped within the demonic prison known as the Helvault, the inquisitors led a series of brutal forays into Kessig and the Gavony Moorland. They executed suspected lycanthropes with little or no proof, and punished accused heretics in unsanctioned trials. With Avacyn's madness, this savage form of inquisition has become the norm, and inquisitors who still pry into dark mysteries have become a minority.": "在历史上，{@background Inquisitor|PSI|inquisitors}是调查世俗和超自然犯罪的卡塔尔侦探。他们因前往被不明原因的谋杀案困扰的偏远教区，以及揭露生活在正常人类中的狼人而闻名。在阿瓦辛不在的时候，当大天使被困在被称为 \"地狱之门 \"的恶魔监狱中时，审问者们在凯西格和加沃尼荒地进行了一系列残酷的袭击。他们在几乎没有证据的情况下处决了被怀疑是狼人的人，并在未经批准的审判中惩罚被指控的异教徒。随着阿瓦辛的疯狂，这种野蛮的宗教裁判所形式已经成为常态，而仍然窥探黑暗奥秘的裁判员已经成为少数。",
	"Emrakul is the largest and most fearsome of the three Eldrazi titans imprisoned on Zendikar. She causes silent horror wherever she soars, embodying desolation, emotional and physical distance, the chill of the void, and the terror of being alone. Thus, in many ways, she is perfectly at home on Innistrad.": "埃姆拉库尔是被囚禁在赞迪卡的三个埃尔德拉兹巨兽中最大、最可怕的一个。她在任何地方都会造成无声的恐怖，体现了荒凉、情感和身体的距离、虚空的寒意以及孤独的恐怖。因此，从很多方面来说，她在因斯特拉德的家是完美的。",
	"Emrakul's initial approach to Innistrad pressed on the minds of that plane's inhabitants, straining their sanity. Her full manifestation then amplified that effect. Cultists who bordered on mad obsession descended into gibbering adulation of their Eldrazi idol, and scholars who pried into dark secrets fell catatonic with the full realization of the alien horror they studied.": "埃姆拉库尔最初进入因斯特拉德时，对该位面居民的思想造成了压力，使他们的理智受到影响。她的完全显现又放大了这种影响。近乎疯狂迷恋的崇拜者们陷入了对他们的艾德拉兹偶像的胡言乱语的崇拜中，而探究黑暗秘密的学者们则因为完全意识到他们所研究的外星恐怖而陷入了紧张状态。",
	"Emrakul arrived on Innistrad without her brood of drones and other spawn, so she immediately began warping the native creatures of the plane—both natural and unnatural—in her own monstrous image. Beings transformed into Emrakul's spawn manifested fleshy lattice structures, distorted symmetry, and tentacles ending in knobby, vestigial digits. Those who had already begun their descent into corruption before the Eldrazi's arrival were warped almost beyond recognition, but even those who fought against the madness during her approach were susceptible to the life-warping affects of her presence.": "埃姆拉库尔到达因斯特拉德时并没有带着她的无人机和其他卵子，所以她立即开始以她自己的畸形形象扭曲这个星球的本地生物--包括自然和非自然的生物。被转化为埃姆拉库尔卵子的生物表现出肉质的格子结构、扭曲的对称性和以多节的残余指头为末端的触手。那些在埃尔德拉兹到来之前就已经开始堕落的人几乎被扭曲得面目全非，但即使是那些在她接近时与疯狂作斗争的人也容易受到她存在的生命扭曲的影响。",
	"Emrakul's arrival set a new series of horrific events in motion, as humans and monsters alike found their very existence threatened by this blasphemous horror.": "埃姆拉库尔的到来引发了一系列新的恐怖事件，人类和怪物都发现他们的存在受到了这个亵渎神明的恐怖的威胁。",
	"Mental corruption is not the only effect of Emrakul's presence on Innistrad, however. Particularly after the Eldrazi titan fully emerges into the plane, the madness she brings is accompanied by physical mutation as well. Rather than unleashing hordes of spawn upon the world as the Eldrazi did on Zendikar, Emrakul causes the living creatures of Innistrad to transform into her spawn, becoming warped and horrible fusions of normal and Eldrazi flesh. This physical transformation first takes hold of humans whose minds have already been touched by the Eldrazi's approach, with mental obsession often manifesting in physical expression. But Emrakul's physical presence affects every living thing nearby.": "然而，精神上的堕落并不是艾姆拉库尔出现在因斯特拉德的唯一影响。特别是在埃尔德拉兹巨人完全出现在这个位面之后，她带来的疯狂也伴随着身体的变异。艾姆拉库尔并没有像艾德拉兹在赞迪卡大陆上那样向世界释放成群的卵子，而是让因斯特拉德的生物转变为她的卵子，成为正常人和艾德拉兹肉体的扭曲和恐怖的融合体。这种身体上的转变首先会影响到那些已经被埃尔德拉兹的方法触动了思想的人类，精神上的迷恋往往表现在身体上。但埃姆拉库尔的身体存在会影响附近的每一个生物。",
	"Even before Emrakul's arrival, some cultists and those who pried too deep into dark secrets begin to change. In this early stage, physical proportions shift, with one or more of the creature's limbs or some part of the face growing larger, almost always asymmetrically. Noticeable skin blemishes can also appear, most often as boils or clumps of cauliflower-like growths (though these do not yet resemble the lattice of Emrakul's flesh). Creature statistics are unchanged.": "甚至在埃姆拉库尔到来之前，一些邪教徒和那些窥探黑暗秘密太深的人就开始发生变化。在这个早期阶段，身体比例会发生变化，一个或多个生物的四肢或脸的某些部分会变大，几乎总是不对称的。明显的皮肤瑕疵也会出现，最常见的是疖子或菜花状的生长物（尽管这些还不像埃姆拉库尔的肉格）。生物的统计数据没有变化。",
	"In the second stage, a creature can develop a dead or bulging eye, huge tumorous growths, curled hands or feet, violent palsy, oozing secretions from the skin or eyes, raw red patches on the skin, and similar deformities. Patches of lattice-like growths often appear on the skin. In some cases, particularly in Nephalia, cultists begin to manifest distinctly fishlike features—goggling eyes, scaled or slimy skin, webbing between the fingers or toes, or gill-like flaps on the face or neck. Creature statistics remain unchanged.": "在第二阶段，生物可以出现死眼或凸出的眼睛，巨大的肿瘤性生长，手或脚卷曲，剧烈麻痹，皮肤或眼睛有渗出的分泌物，皮肤上有生的红色斑块，以及类似的畸形。皮肤上经常出现成片的格子状生长。在某些情况下，特别是在尼法利亚，邪教徒开始表现出明显的鱼形特征--眼睛瞪得大大的，皮肤上有鳞片或黏糊糊的，手指或脚趾间有蹼，或者脸上或脖子上有鳃状的皮瓣。生物的统计数据保持不变。",
	"In the third stage, the lips shrink away from the teeth, which can rot and fall out. Fingers and toes sometimes fuse together or start transforming into tentacles. Bleeding sores erupt on the skin, or bulbous growths can appear under the skin. Cultists in Nephalia often grow finlike protrusions or pincerlike hands. At this stage, creatures might manifest improved natural armor or weapons, or simple benefits such as the Amphibious trait of a {@creature bullywug}, the Blind Senses of a {@creature grimlock}, Chameleon Skin like a {@creature troglodyte}, the Slippery trait of a {@creature kuo-toa}, or the Spider Climb trait of an {@creature ettercap}.": "在第三阶段，嘴唇从牙齿上缩走，牙齿会腐烂和脱落。手指和脚趾有时会融合在一起，或开始转变为触手。皮肤上会出现出血的溃疡，或者在皮肤下出现球状的生长物。尼法利亚的崇拜者经常长出鳍状突起或钳状手。在这个阶段，生物可能会表现出改进的天然盔甲或武器，或简单的好处，如{@creature bullywug}的两栖特性，{@creature grimlock}的盲目感官，{@creature troglodyte}的变色龙皮肤，{@creature kuo-toa}的滑溜特性，或{@creature ettercap}的蜘蛛攀爬特性。",
	"In the fourth stage, a creature's flesh often rots away or grows out of control, either leaving muscle and bone visible beneath or concealing features beneath masses of fleshy lattice or bulbous growths. Bone structure can alter radically, creating additional limbs or turning existing limbs into bizarrely jointed tentacles. Extra eyes can appear in unexpected places, or the head can transform into something resembling a fish or octopus.": "在第四阶段，生物的肉体通常会腐烂或失控生长，要么留下可见的肌肉和骨骼，要么将特征隐藏在大量的肉格子或球状的生长物之下。骨骼结构可以彻底改变，形成额外的肢体或将现有的肢体变成怪异的关节触手。额外的眼睛可以出现在意想不到的地方，或者头部可以转变为类似于鱼或章鱼的东西。",
	"The most warped creatures are barely even recognizable. Some become little more than a mass of writhing tentacles, or lose their physical coherence entirely. Two or more creatures can fuse together, joined by fleshy lattice. The \"lucky\" ones retain a basically humanoid shape, but otherwise appear completely monstrous, with twisted faces, extra limbs, horny growths, jointed tentacle extrusions, and so on. Such a creature might effectively become an Eldrazilike monster such as an {@creature aboleth}, a {@creature chuul}, a {@creature cloaker}, a {@creature gibbering mouther}, or a {@creature mind flayer}.": "最扭曲的生物甚至几乎无法辨认。有的变成了一团蠕动的触手，或者完全失去了身体的连贯性。两个或更多的生物可以融合在一起，由肉质晶格连接。那些 \"幸运 \"的生物基本上保留了人形，但在其他方面则显得完全畸形，有扭曲的面孔、多余的肢体、角质的生长、有关节的触手挤压，等等。这样的生物可能有效地成为Eldrazilike怪物，如{@creature aboleth}、{@creature chuul}、{@creature cloaker}、{@creature gibbering mouther}、或{@creature mind flayer}。",
	"Innistrad's ancient history speaks of a human alchemist and healer named Edgar Markov, who sought to preserve his own life and the lives of his family. As old age began to claim him, he despaired of finding an alchemical solution and turned to black magic. Not long after, the demon Shilgengar appeared to Markov and revealed a means by which he could achieve immortality: a dark ritual that involved drinking an angel's blood.": "Innistrad的古老历史讲述了一个名叫埃德加-马可夫的人类炼金术士和治疗师，他试图保护自己和家人的生命。随着年龄的增长，他对找到炼金术的解决方案感到绝望，转而求助于黑魔法。不久之后，恶魔希尔根格出现在马尔科夫面前，并向他透露了一种可以获得永生的方法：一种涉及饮用天使之血的黑暗仪式。",
	"The vampires of Innistrad are all descended from twelve ancient sires—the congregation that participated in Markov's blasphemous ritual. Of these twelve bloodlines, four constitute the vast majority of Innistrad's vampires: Markov, Voldaren, Falkenrath, and Stromkirk. Three of the others have died out completely, while five are so few in number as to be irrelevant. One of those nearly irrelevant lines is that of Strefan Maurer, who rules a remote region in Stensia's outland valleys.": "因斯泰德的吸血鬼都是十二个古老祖先的后裔--参加了马尔科夫亵渎仪式的会众。在这十二个血统中，有四个构成了因斯泰德吸血鬼的绝大部分。马尔科夫、沃尔达伦、法尔肯拉斯和斯特罗姆克。其他三个已经完全消亡，而五个的数量少到无关紧要。其中一个几乎无关紧要的血统是斯特里凡-毛勒（Strefan Maurer），他统治着斯滕西亚（Stensia）外围山谷中的一个偏远地区。",
	"This chapter offers suggestions for situating the region of Barovia, which is detailed in the Ravenloft adventure Curse of Strahd, within the plane of Innistrad. The changes range from the merely cosmetic (changing the Balinok Mountains to the Geier Reach, for example) to more thorough reimaginings of Ravenloft elements foreign to Innistrad, such as dusk elves, wereravens, and the enigmatic Vistani.": "本章提供了将巴罗维亚地区置于伊尼斯特拉平面内的建议，该地区在《拉文洛夫特》的冒险《斯特拉赫特的诅咒》中已有详细介绍。变化的范围从单纯的外观（例如，将巴里诺克山脉改为盖尔山脉）到更彻底地重塑因斯泰德所不具备的拉文洛夫特元素，例如黄昏精灵、狼人和神秘的维斯坦人。",
	"Much of the description of Barovia presented in chapter 2 of Curse of Strahd applies to Innistrad generally and to the outland valleys of Stensia in particular. Some elements do not apply, including the mists of Ravenloft. No magical barrier imprisons people in the outland valleys, or even on Innistrad as a whole. Planeswalkers, at least, can leave the plane, and high-level spellcasters native to Innistrad might be able to glimpse realms beyond the Blind Eternities through their magic.": "斯特拉赫特的诅咒》第二章中对巴罗维亚的描述，大部分都适用于因斯特拉德，特别是斯滕西亚的外域山谷。有些元素并不适用，包括拉文洛夫特的迷雾。没有魔法屏障可以禁锢外域山谷中的人，甚至整个因斯泰德的人。至少，行者们可以离开这个位面，而因斯泰德的高级施法者可能会通过他们的魔法瞥见盲目的永恒之外的领域。",
	"The description of the dour people of Barovia applies to Stensians as a rule. However, all Stensians have souls, and those souls are not trapped on Innistrad.": "对巴罗维亚人的描述通常适用于斯滕西亚人。然而，所有斯滕西亚人都有灵魂，而且这些灵魂并没有被困在因斯泰德。",
	"The history of Strefan Maurer runs parallel to that of Strahd von Zarovich. After his father's death, Strefan studied magic and forged a pact with the demon Shilgengar in return for the promise of immortality. After murdering his brother Sergei and drinking his blood, Strefan journeyed to Markov Manor and consulted with Edgar Markov. Together, they worked with Shilgengar to create the twelve bloodlines of vampires on Innistrad. Maurer Estate (Castle Ravenloft) was not spirited away to a demiplane—it was already on Innistrad, itself a place of nightmares. And Strefan is not trapped here, so he is not seeking a successor in hopes of escaping. Newcomers to his domain do attract his attention, though, as the possibility of meeting a new consort is always on Strefan's mind.": "Strefan Maurer的历史与Strahd von Zarovich的历史是平行的。父亲去世后，Strefan学习了魔法，并与恶魔Shilgengar签订了契约，以换取不朽的承诺。在谋杀了他的兄弟谢尔盖并喝了他的血之后，斯特莱凡来到马尔科夫庄园，向埃德加-马尔科夫咨询。他们一起与希尔根格合作，在因斯泰德创造了十二个吸血鬼血统。毛勒庄园（Castle Ravenloft）并没有被传送到一个半位面--它已经在因斯泰德，本身就是一个噩梦之地。而斯特凡并没有被困在这里，所以他并没有在寻找继承人，希望能够逃脱。不过，来到他的领地的新人确实吸引了他的注意，因为与新妃子见面的可能性总是在斯特莱凡的脑海中。",
	"Strefan's statistics are unchanged from the statistics of Strahd in the Curse of Strahd adventure, except that he lacks the Vampire Weaknesses feature. Instead, Strefan has the weaknesses shared by Innistrad vampires (see that earlier section).": "斯特莱凡的统计资料与《斯特拉赫特的诅咒》冒险中的斯特拉赫特的统计资料没有变化，只是他缺乏吸血鬼的弱点特征。相反，Strefan拥有Innistrad吸血鬼共有的弱点（见前面那一节）。",
	"The region shown on the map in the Curse of Strahd adventure covers most of the outland valleys, the dales of the Geier Reach that are farthest from Gavony and Kessig. Only place names within the region need updating; the rest of the region's geography is unchanged. The Balinok Mountains are the Geier Reach, the Svalich Woods are the Somberwald, Lake Zarovich is Maurer Lake, and the Old Svalich Road is Somber Road.": "斯特拉赫特的诅咒》冒险中的地图所显示的区域涵盖了大部分内陆谷地，即离加沃尼和凯西格最远的盖尔河谷地区。只有该地区的地名需要更新，该地区的其他地理环境没有变化。巴里诺克山是盖尔河，斯瓦利奇森林是桑伯瓦尔德，扎罗维奇湖是毛勒湖，老斯瓦利奇路是桑伯路。",
	"Two passes cross the Geier Reach to connect the outland valleys with the wider world. Hofsaddel is the more often used, a wide and well-trodden pass mostly ignored by the vampires. The Somber Road runs through this pass, but it is a long and circuitous route. By contrast, Needle's Eye is a narrow, treacherous, and deadly path haunted by vengeful geists. It is a more direct path, but it runs perilously close to the demonic gateway known as Ashmouth, so humans use this pass only in the most dire need.": "有两个通道穿过盖尔河，将外围的山谷与更广阔的世界连接起来。霍夫萨德尔（Hofsaddel）是一个更经常使用的通道，这是一个宽阔的、被人熟知的通道，大多被吸血鬼所忽视。忧郁之路穿过这个山口，但它是一条漫长而迂回的路线。相比之下，针眼（Needle's Eye）是一条狭窄、险恶、致命的道路，被复仇的地精困扰着。这是一条更直接的道路，但它危险地接近被称为阿什茅斯的恶魔之门，所以人类只有在最迫切的需要时才会使用这个通道。",
	"The lore known to the people of Stensia is different in detail but similar in substance to what is presented in the Curse of Strahd adventure.": "斯滕西亚人所知的传说在细节上有所不同，但实质上与《斯特拉赫特的诅咒》冒险中的内容相似。",
	"The people of Stensia and the outland valleys know the following about Strefan Maurer and vampires in general:": "斯滕西亚和外围山谷的人们对斯特凡-毛勒和一般的吸血鬼有以下了解。",
	"Strefan Maurer is a vampire, and he dwells in Maurer Estate. No one is welcome at the estate.": "Strefan Maurer是一个吸血鬼，他住在Maurer庄园。庄园里不欢迎任何人。",
	"Strefan the fiend is a curse placed on the land because of some forgotten sin committed by the ancestors of the people of Shadowgrange. (This is untrue, but the people of the outland valleys believe it.)": "Strefan这个恶魔是对这片土地的诅咒，因为Shadowgrange人民的祖先犯下了一些被遗忘的罪行。(这是不真实的，但内陆谷地的人们相信它）。",
	"Vampires have three supernatural characteristics that are shared across all bloodlines: agelessness, superhuman strength (mostly an exaggeration), and an aura of silence that emanates from them at will to a radius of two feet. Elder vampires can learn powerful magic of many different kinds, such as flight, a hypnotic gaze, or the ability to transform into other forms such as that of a bat or a mist.": "吸血鬼有三个所有血统共有的超自然特征：不老不死，超人的力量（主要是夸张），以及一种沉默的光环，可以随意从他们身上散发到两英尺的范围。老年吸血鬼可以学习许多不同种类的强大魔法，如飞行、催眠的目光，或转化为其他形式的能力，如蝙蝠或雾。",
	"Weapons cut from living wood are particularly effective against vampires, though any weapon can harm or kill them. A vampire can't cross running water that shows the reflection of the moon, and water blessed by Avacyn burns vampire flesh like acid. The holy symbols of Avacyn, blessed in the proper rituals of the church, can fill a vampire with a paralyzing fear and a desire to flee.": "从活木上切割下来的武器对吸血鬼特别有效，尽管任何武器都可以伤害或杀死他们。吸血鬼无法越过显示月亮倒影的流水，而被阿瓦辛祝福的水会像酸一样燃烧吸血鬼的肉体。阿瓦辛的神圣符号，在教会的适当仪式中得到祝福，可以使吸血鬼充满麻痹的恐惧和逃离的欲望。",

	"Never harm a raven, lest ill fortune befall you!": "千万不要伤害乌鸦，否则会有厄运降临在你身上。",
	"Little changes about this peaceful village as it is described in the Curse of Strahd adventure, except that the religious trappings found in the church use the iconography of the church of Avacyn and the archangel Sigarda. The holy symbol seen in the office is not a sunburst but Avacyn's Y-shaped collar, looking slightly distorted because of the angels' madness. The priest Donavich prays to the angels, not the gods.": "在《斯特拉赫特的诅咒》冒险中描述的这个宁静的村庄几乎没有什么变化，只是在教堂里发现的宗教装饰品使用了阿瓦辛和大天使西加达的教堂的图标。在办公室里看到的神圣符号不是太阳花，而是阿瓦辛的Y型衣领，由于天使的疯狂，看起来略微有些扭曲。牧师多纳维奇向天使祈祷，而不是向神灵祈祷。",

As creatures of pure mana, demons can never be truly destroyed. When a demon dies, its essence is scattered for a time, but that essence eventually coalesces into a new form. The power of Avacynian magic keeps the essence of slain demons from creating new demonic forms as quickly as was common in Avacyn's early days.

	"As it did during Avacyn's absence, the most prominent demon cult on Innistrad exists within the highest levels of the hierarchy of Avacyn's church. The influence of the Skirsdag Cult is strong within the Lunarch Council, and that influence has whipped the church into a murderous frenzy in response to the angels' madness.

	"With the madness of the angels, a variety of new cults sprang up across Innistrad. Some were direct continuations of the demon cults that had proliferated during Avacyn's absence, but others were entirely new—centered on madness and revering monsters that had arisen in response to the angels' madness. Many such cults can be traced to the activity of Nahiri—the stoneforging Planeswalker known as the Lithomancer.": "随着天使的疯狂，各种新的异教团在因尼斯特拉德大地上涌现。有些是直接延续了在阿瓦辛缺席期间蔓延的恶魔异教团，但还有一些是全新的——以疯狂为中心，崇拜因天使疯狂而出现的怪物。许多这样的异教团可以追溯到纳希瑞（Lithomancer）—这位以石头锻造为名的位面漫步者的活动。",
	"Many of the cults that once followed demons saw their patrons destroyed when Avacyn emerged from the Helvault. The people who belonged to those cults were not so quickly restored to church and community, and many of them remain disgruntled, rebellious, or insane. Nahiri has played on their discontent and given them new masters to serve. Some revere her, especially in Stensia, believing that she is an ancient vampire. Others offer sacrifices to the monsters of the world—including those in Nephalia who worship the monstrous kraken-like Kralmar.": "许多曾经追随恶魔的邪教在阿瓦辛（Avacyn）从地狱拱顶（Helvault）中出现时看到他们的主宰被摧毁。属于那些邪教的人并没有很快被恢复到教会和社区中，其中许多人仍然心怀不满、叛逆或疯狂。娜希莉（Nahiri）利用了他们的不满情绪，并给予他们新的主人来侍奉。一些人尤其在斯坦西亚（Stensia）尊敬她，认为她是一位古老的吸血鬼。还有一些人向世界上的怪物献祭，包括尼法利亚（Nephalia）那些崇拜类似巨型海怪克拉玛（Kralmar）的怪物的人。",
	"Many of these cults gather around spires of twisted stone (called cryptoliths) that Nahiri has raised from the ground across the provinces. The true purpose of these stones—redirecting the ley lines of mana flowing through the plane—is lost on the cultists, but the redirection of mana has caused the madness of the angels, who are formed of raw mana. Whether this was Nahiri's intent or simply a side effect of some greater plan remains a mystery. Many cultists view the angels' madness as a sign of the dawning of a new age, believing that the angels are purging those who are unworthy to be present when some unknown apocalypse occurs.": "许多这些异教团体聚集在扭曲石柱（称为 cryptoliths）周围，这些石柱是 Nahiri 从地面上升起的，遍布各省。这些石头的真正目的——重新定向穿越这片领域的法力脉络——对异教徒来说已经失去了意义，但法力的重新定向却导致了天使的疯狂，它们是由原始法力形成的。这究竟是 Nahiri 的意图还是某种更大计划的副作用仍然是个谜。许多异教徒将天使的疯狂视为新时代的曙光，相信天使正在净化那些不配在某种未知末日降临时出现的人。",
	"be present when some unknown apocalypse occurs. Followers of Nahiri's cults are physically as well as mentally warped. Their features twist into bestial or fishlike forms, as if they might be regressing through millions of years of evolution.

	"Not all the demons were killed when Avacyn escaped the Helvault, and some of their cults remain intact. The most important of these is the Skirsdag, which hides within the very hierarchy of the church in Thraben. Once dedicated to the archdemon Griselbrand, the Skirsdag is now led by Ormendahl the Reaper, a demon who survived the angelic purge by hiding in caverns deep beneath the cathedral. With the madness of Avacyn, the Skirsdag gains increasing influence over the Lunarch Council, adding violent zeal to the church's inquisition.": "当阿瓦辛逃离地狱之狱时，并非所有恶魔都被杀死，其中一些教派仍然存在。其中最重要的是斯基斯达格 (Skirsdag)，它隐藏在萨班 (Thraben) 教堂的层级之中。曾经致力于大恶魔格里斯布兰德 (Griselbrand) 的斯基斯达格现在由收割者奥门达尔 (Ormendahl) 领导，这位恶魔通过藏身在大教堂深处的洞穴中幸存了天使的清洗。随着阿瓦辛的疯狂，斯基斯达格对月神议会的影响力不断增强，为教会的审判添加了暴力狂热。",

Like geists, elementals are closely associated with specific colors of mana.": "元素生物是自然力量的体现，在伊尼斯特拉德，这通常意味着邪恶的力量。它们起源于扭曲的森林——乌尔文瓦尔德和萧姆伯瓦尔德——这些森林隐藏着伊尼斯特拉德最可怕的怪物，或者从像仇恨之锅一样沸腾的火焰裂缝中产生。像幽灵一样，元素生物与特定颜色的法力密切相关。",
	"Green-aligned elementals usually take on gnarled humanoid shapes made up of wood stalks and twisting vines, best represented as {@creature treant|MM|treants}, {@b blights}, {@creature shambling mound|MM|shambling mounds}, or {@creature awakened tree|MM|awakened trees} and {@creature awakened shrub|MM|awakened shrubs}. Others are nature spirits and spirit animals. Some of these are relatively benign, including beautiful nature spirits ({@creature dryad|MM|dryads}) wrapped in vine and thorn. Cold-burning geistflames made of unnatural fire ({@creature will-o'-wisp|MM|will-o'-wisps}) seem unconcerned with human life, but often lead travelers through the woods and bogs into danger. Malign kindercatches ({@creature green hag|MM|green hags}) steal children from the forest villages of Kessig.": "绿色元素生灵通常呈现出由木杆和缠绕藤蔓构成的扭曲人形，最好以{@creature treant|MM|treants}、{@b blights}、{@creature shambling mound|MM|shambling mounds}或{@creature awakened tree|MM|awakened trees}和{@creature awakened shrub|MM|awakened shrubs}来代表。其他的是自然灵体和灵兽。其中一些相对温和，包括被藤蔓和荆棘包裹着的美丽自然灵体({@creature dryad|MM|dryads})。由非自然之火构成的冷焰幽灵火({@creature will-o'-wisp|MM|will-o'-wisps})似乎不关心人类生命，但常常引导旅行者穿越树林和沼泽，置之于危险之中。邪恶的幼童捕捉者({@creature green hag|MM|green hags})从凯西格(Kessig)的森林村庄中绑架儿童。",
	"Red-aligned elementals are fiery beasts ({@creature hell hound|MM|hell hounds}) or spirits ({@creature fire elemental|MM|fire elementals}) that haunt places like Ashmouth or Devil's Breach.": "红色对齐元素生物是火焰野兽({@creature hell hound|MM|hell hounds})或灵体({@creature fire elemental|MM|fire elementals})，它们出没在像灰口或魔鬼裂口这样的地方。",
	"The story of Shadows over Innistrad and Eldritch Moon is shaped by Emrakul's arrival and the madness that spreads across the plane around the Eldrazi titan. A D&D campaign set on Innistrad can ignore this aspect of the story and focus instead on the themes of more traditional Gothic horror. But if you do want to add elements of Emrakul's madness to your campaign, use the {@variantrule New Ability Scores: Honor and Sanity||Sanity score} rules in chapter 9 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Allow characters to make Sanity checks to interpret the effects of Emrakul's corruption, and Sanity saving throws to resist the effects of the spreading madness.": "《暗影超越因尼斯特拉德》和《埃尔德里奇之月》的故事受到艾默库尔的到来以及围绕这位异界泰坦的疯狂蔓延而塑造。在因尼斯特拉德上设定的D&D战役可以忽略这个故事的一面，而是专注于更传统哥特式恐怖的主题。但如果你想在你的战役中添加艾默库尔疯狂的元素，可以使用《地牢主指南》第9章中的{@variantrule New Ability Scores: Honor and Sanity||Sanity score}规则。允许角色进行理智检定来解释艾默库尔的腐化效应，并进行理智豁免检定来抵抗蔓延疯狂的效应。",
	"A creature or character whose {@variantrule New Ability Scores: Honor and Sanity||Sanity score} is below 10 can begin to manifest signs of physical corruption, which progresses in stages.": "一个生物或角色，其{@variantrule New Ability Scores: Honor and Sanity||Sanity score}低于10的话，可能开始出现身体腐化的迹象，这种腐化会逐渐加重。",
	"At this stage, a corrupted creature might begin to transform into an entirely different creature. A human could effectively become any of the creatures mentioned above, or some other vaguely humanoid monster such as a {@creature kenku}, a {@creature lizardfolk}, a {@creature sahuagin}, or a {@filter yuan-ti|bestiary|search=yuan-ti}.": "在这个阶段，一个被腐化的生物可能开始转变成一个完全不同的生物。一个人类可能有效地变成上述任何一种生物，或者是一些其他模糊的类人怪物，比如一个{@creature kenku}，一个{@creature lizardfolk}，一个{@creature sahuagin}，或者一个{@filter yuan-ti|bestiary|search=yuan-ti}。",
	"This chapter offers suggestions for situating the region of Barovia, which is detailed in the Ravenloft adventure {@adventure Curse of Strahd|CoS}, within the plane of Innistrad. The changes range from the merely cosmetic (changing the Balinok Mountains to the Geier Reach, for example) to more thorough reimaginings of Ravenloft elements foreign to Innistrad, such as dusk elves, wereravens, and the enigmatic Vistani.": "这一章提供了将拉文洛夫冒险{@adventure Curse of Strahd|CoS}中详细描述的巴洛维亚地区置于因尼斯特拉德平面内的建议。这些变化范围从纯粹的表面变化（例如将巴里诺克山改为盖尔到达）到对因尼斯特拉德陌生的拉文洛夫元素的更彻底的重新想象，比如黄昏精灵、狼人乌鸦和神秘的瓦斯塔尼人。",
	"Much of the description of Barovia presented in {@adventure chapter 2 of Curse of Strahd|CoS|3} applies to Innistrad generally and to the outland valleys of Stensia in particular. Some elements do not apply, including the mists of Ravenloft. No magical barrier imprisons people in the outland valleys, or even on Innistrad as a whole. Planeswalkers, at least, can leave the plane, and high-level spellcasters native to Innistrad might be able to glimpse realms beyond the Blind Eternities through their magic.": "{@adventure chapter 2 of Curse of Strahd|CoS|3}中描述的巴洛维亚的许多情况通常适用于因尼斯特拉德，特别是斯坦西亚的外地山谷。一些元素不适用，包括雷文洛夫特的迷雾。没有魔法屏障囚禁人们在外地山谷，甚至整个因尼斯特拉德。位面漫步者至少可以离开这个位面，而因尼斯特拉德本地的高级法术施展者可能能够通过他们的魔法瞥见盲目永恒之外的境界。",
	"The lore known to the people of Stensia is different in detail but similar in substance to what is presented in the {@i Curse of Strahd} adventure.": "Stensia的居民所知的传说在细节上有所不同，但在实质上与{@i Curse of Strahd}冒险中呈现的内容相似。",
	"Little changes about this peaceful village as it is described in the {@i Curse of Strahd} adventure, except that the religious trappings found in the church use the iconography of the church of Avacyn and the archangel Sigarda. The holy symbol seen in the office is not a sunburst but Avacyn's Y-shaped collar, looking slightly distorted because of the angels' madness. The priest Donavich prays to the angels, not the gods.": "在{@i Curse of Strahd}冒险中描述的这个宁静村庄有一些小改变，除了教堂中发现的宗教装饰采用了阿瓦辛教堂和大天使希嘉达的图像。办公室里看到的圣徽不是太阳爆炸图案，而是阿瓦辛的Y形领章，因为天使的疯狂而略显扭曲。牧师多纳维奇向天使祈祷，而不是向神祈祷。",
		"Madam Eva's people are the Bitterhearts, represented on cards like {@link Bitterheart Witch|https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=222205} (from the original Innistrad set) and {@link Wakedancer|https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/details.aspx?multiverseid=262836} (from Dark Ascension). They are descended from a people whose village was swallowed up in the chasm of Ashmouth. To ensure their survival, they made a pact with a demon and took up a nomadic existence. Of course, not all Bitterhearts are witches. Some have taken up a life of banditry, some serve Strefan directly, and some remember their people's ancient devotion to the Demonlord of Ashmouth.": "伊娃夫人的族人是苦心族，如{@link Bitterheart Witch|https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=222205}（来自原始的Innistrad扩展包）和{@link Wakedancer|https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/details.aspx?multiverseid=262836}（来自黑色风暴扩展包）所示。他们是一个村庄被Ashmouth深渊吞噬的人的后代。为了确保他们的生存，他们与恶魔达成了协议，并开始了游牧生活。当然，并非所有苦心族人都是女巫。一些人从事抢劫生活，一些人直接侍奉斯特雷凡，还有一些人记得他们的祖先对Ashmouth恶魔领主的古老忠诚。",
	"As with the other people of the outland valleys, the lore known by the Bitterhearts is mostly the same as that known by the Vistani in {@i Curse of Strahd}.": "与外地山谷的其他人一样，苦心族所知道的传说大多与{@i Curse of Strahd}的维斯塔尼人所知道的相同。",
	"The Stensians are a simple, frightened people.": "斯坦尼亚人是一个简单、害怕的民族。",
	"Lammas also harbors the rebellious Blade of the Inquisitors, Rem Karolus, who is staying at the Blue Water Inn and goes by the name Rictavio. (People speaking of him do not describe pointed ears, since he is and appears fully human.) Rather than a saber-toothed tiger, he has a captive nettle swine (a {@creature giant boar}). Rictavio's journal describes \"oddities\" that can be attributed to the approach of Emrakul:": "拉玛斯还隐藏着叛逆的审判者之刃，雷姆·卡罗卢斯，他住在蓝水客栈，化名里克塔维奥。 （提到他的人并没有描述他有尖耳朵，因为他看起来完全是人类。） 他并没有一只剑齿虎，而是养了一只被俘的荨麻猪（一个{@creature giant boar}）。 里克塔维奥的日记描述了可以归因于埃姆拉库接近的“奇异现象”：",
	"The approach of Emrakul has filled the abbey to overflowing, and physical corruption commensurate with the growing madness has transformed unfortunate victims into creatures akin to the mongrelfolk of the {@i Curse of Strahd} adventure. The abbess of the madhouse is an angel who once fought alongside Saint Traft, and who has descended into utter madness since the ancient saint's death.": "埃莫库尔的出现使修道院溢出，随着疯狂的增长，与之相称的身体腐化将不幸的受害者转变为类似{@i Curse of Strahd}冒险中的杂种人的生物。疯人院的院长是一位曾与圣特拉夫一起战斗的天使，在古圣者去世后陷入彻底的疯狂。",
	"The Needle's Eye traverses the Midland Range to connect Stensia's outland valleys and inland valleys. Its proximity to Ashmouth means it is haunted by demons, including the {@creature vrock|MM|vrocks} atop the gatehouse wall. Far worse, replacing the roc of Mount Ghakis, is the {@creature Demonlord of Ashmouth|PSI}, a terrible and ancient fiend. It uses the statistics of a horned devil, except that it uses a battleaxe instead of a fork.": "针眼穿越米德兰山脉，连接斯坦西亚的外地山谷和内地山谷。由于靠近灰烬口，它被恶魔所困扰，包括在门楼墙上的{@creature vrock|MM|vrocks}。更糟糕的是，取代了加基斯山的大鹏，是{@creature Demonlord of Ashmouth|PSI}，一个可怕且古老的恶魔。它使用一只战斧，而不是叉子，除此之外，它使用一只角魔的统计数据。",
	"The dragon that appears if characters fail to correctly open the door to Karolus's tower is a balefire dragon, but with the statistics of a {@creature young blue dragon}.": "如果角色们未能正确打开Karolus塔的大门，将出现一只烈焰龙，但其统计数据与{@creature young blue dragon}相同。",
	"The {@creature druid||druids} and {@filter blights|bestiary|search=blight} here come from Yester Hill.": "这里的{@creature druid||druids}和{@filter blights|bestiary|search=blight}来自昨日山(Yester Hill)。",
	"This ancient structure predates any of the known peoples and cultures of Innistrad. The good-aligned wizards who built it anticipated the Helvault by entrapping semidivine evil forces in silver-lined prisons. Everywhere in the temple that amber is described, use silver instead. Both the {@creature arcanaloth} and the {@creature death slaad} here are various forms of Innistrad demons.": "这座古老的建筑早于Innistrad已知的任何民族和文化。建造它的正义巫师们预见到了Helvault，通过将半神邪恶力量困在镀银监狱中来阻止它。在描述琥珀的地方，请使用银代替。这里的{@creature arcanaloth}和{@creature death slaad}都是Innistrad恶魔的不同形式。",
	"You can adapt the adventure hooks found in {@i Curse of Strahd} as follows.": "您可以按照以下方式调整{@i Curse of Strahd}中找到的冒险钩。",
	"Instead of the Lords' Alliance, use the Quiver of Kessig, who are experts at hunting werewolves. Eravien (a human Kessiger, not a half-elf as in {@i Curse of Strahd}) tells the adventurers that the werewolves are a branch of the Mondronen howlpack, which practices dark forms of blood magic.": "不要使用Lords' Alliance，而是使用Quiver of Kessig，他们是狼人猎手的专家。Eravien（一个人类凯西格人，而不是像{@i Curse of Strahd}中的半精灵）告诉冒险者们，这些狼人是Mondronen嚎叫群体的一个分支，擅长黑暗形式的血魔法。",
	"Since there are no mists to transport characters to Stensia's outland valleys, this hook doesn't apply if you are running {@i Curse of Strahd} in Innistrad.": "由于没有雾气可以将角色传送到斯坦西亚的偏远山谷，如果你在伊尼斯特拉德中进行{@i Curse of Strahd}，这个钩子就不适用。",
	"The first time the player characters encounter these Somberwald trappers, the group is led by a man named Paulin (whom the players might recognize from flavor text on a handful of cards in the original Innistrad block). He leaves them with some words of wisdom: \"Bury your dead deep. The boars are hungriest while the corpse is still warm.\" (At your discretion, you can also replace {@creature berserker||berserkers} with a like number of {@creature giant boar||giant boars} in a random encounter.)": "当玩家角色第一次遇到这些Somberwald陷阱者时，这个小组由一名名叫保林(Paulin)的男子带领（玩家可能会从原始Innistrad卡牌组中的一些口味文本中认出他）。他留下了一些智慧的话：“把你们的死者埋得深一些。猪在尸体还温暖的时候最饥饿。”（根据您的判断，您也可以在一次随机遭遇中用{@creature giant boar||giant boars}替换相同数量的{@creature berserker||berserkers}。）",
	"Found on Maurer Lake, Bluto has gone mad under the influence of the approach of Emrakul. He has devoted himself to an aquatic being he believes lives in the depths of the lake—something akin to the Gitrog monster or the squidlike Kralmar worshiped by coastal cults in Nephalia. Bluto has gill-like flaps on his neck. At your discretion, you could introduce an encounter with the creature he worships, which might be something like a {@creature giant crocodile}.": "在莫瑞尔湖发现，布鲁托在艾默库尔接近的影响下变得疯狂。他将自己奉献给了一个他认为生活在湖底的水生生物——类似于吉特洛格怪兽或者被涅法利亚沿海教派崇拜的类似乌贼的克拉玛尔。布鲁托的颈部有鳃状的皱褶。由你决定，你可以介绍一次与他崇拜的生物相遇的事件，这个生物可能类似于一个{@creature giant crocodile}。",
	"You can use Mordenkainen as written in {@i Curse of Strahd}. Or, in a twisted nod to the storyline of {@i Shadows over Innistrad}, this mad planeswalking mage could be Jace Beleren.

	"Use the {@creature vampire neonate|PSI} statistics in this document whenever the adventurers encounter vampire spawn, rather than the {@creature vampire spawn} statistics in the {@i Monster Manual}.

The two enjoy pretending to be helpless young girls, lost and alone, in order to get close to their prey.": "在冒险者遭遇吸血鬼衍生物时，请使用本文件中的{@creature vampire neonate|PSI}统计数据，而不是{@i Monster Manual}中的{@creature vampire spawn}统计数据。当冒险者第一次遭遇正好两只吸血鬼衍生物时，他们会遇到莫尔庄园的臭名昭著的双胞胎，两个名叫露比（Ruby）和卡米娜（Carmine）的年轻女孩。这两个女孩喜欢假装是无助的小女孩，迷失和孤独，以接近他们的猎物。",
	"Use the {@creature Young Wereraven|CoS|wereraven} statistics in the adventure, except that the beak attack cannot transmit lycanthropy (since the witches of the Keeper of the Feather are not lycanthropes). Wereravens also have the spellcasting ability of the {@creature druid} presented in the {@i Monster Manual}.": "在冒险中使用{@creature Young Wereraven|CoS|wereraven}的统计数据，但是鸟嘴攻击不能传播狼人病（因为羽毛守护者的女巫们不是狼人）。狼乌鸦还具有{@creature druid}在{@i Monster Manual}中呈现的施法能力。"
