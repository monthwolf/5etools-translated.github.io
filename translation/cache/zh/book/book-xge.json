	"Beneath the bustling City of Waterdeep, a beholder crime lord keeps tabs on everyone and everything—or so the beholder thinks. Known as Xanathar, this bizarre being believes it can gather information on everything in the Dungeons & Dragons multiverse. The beholder desires to know it all! But no matter what the beholder learns and what treasures it acquires, its most prized possession in all the multiverse remains its goldfish, Sylgar.": "在繁华的沃特迪普城下，有一个beholder犯罪头目在监视着每一个人和每一件事--或者说beholder认为是这样。这个被称为 \"Xanathar \"的怪异生物认为它可以收集龙与地下城多元宇宙中的一切信息。观察者渴望了解这一切！但无论观察者了解到什么，他都不知道。但是，无论这个人学到了什么，获得了什么宝藏，它在整个多元宇宙中最珍贵的财产仍然是它的金鱼，希尔加。",
	"The first major rules expansion to the fifth edition of D&D, {@i Xanathar's Guide to Everything} provides a wealth of new options for the game. Xanathar might not be able to realize its dream to know everything, but this book does delve into every major part of the game: adventurers, their adventures, and the magic they wield.": "第五版D&D的第一个主要规则扩展，{@i Xanathar's Guide to Everything}为游戏提供了大量的新选择。Xanathar可能无法实现其了解一切的梦想，但这本书确实深入研究了游戏的每一个主要部分：冒险者、他们的冒险以及他们挥舞的魔法。",
	"Written for both players and Dungeon Masters, this book offers options to enhance campaigns in any world, whether you're adventuring in the Forgotten Realms, another official D&D setting, or a world of your own creation. The options here build on the official rules contained within the player's handbook, the monster manual, and the dungeon master's guide. Think of this book as the companion to those volumes. It builds on their foundation, exploring pathways first laid in those publications. Nothing herein is required for a D&D campaign—this is not a fourth core rulebook—but we hope it will provide you new ways to enjoy the game.": "本书为玩家和地下城主编写，提供了在任何世界中增强战役的选项，无论你是在被遗忘的领域、另一个官方的D&D设定中冒险，还是在你自己创造的世界。这里的选项建立在玩家手册、怪物手册和地下城主指南中的官方规则之上。把这本书看作是这些书的伴侣。它建立在它们的基础上，探索那些出版物中首次提出的途径。本书中没有任何内容是D&D活动所必需的--这不是第四本核心规则书，但我们希望它能为你提供享受游戏的新方法。",
	"Chapter 1 offers character options that expand on those offered in the player's handbook. Chapter 2 is a toolkit for the DM that provides new resources for running the game and designing adventures, all of it building on the Monster Manual and the Dungeon Master's Guide. Chapter 3 presents new spells for player characters and spellcasting monsters to unleash.": "第1章提供了在玩家手册中所提供的角色选项的扩展。第2章是DM的工具包，提供了运行游戏和设计冒险的新资源，所有这些都建立在《怪物手册》和《地牢管理员指南》的基础上。第三章为玩家角色和施法怪物提供了新的法术，供其释放。",
	"Appendix A provides guidance on running a shared campaign, similar to the activities staged by the D&D Adventurers League, and appendix B contains a host of tables that allow you to quickly generate names for the characters in your D&D stories.": "附录A提供了关于开展共享活动的指导，类似于D&D冒险者联盟举办的活动，附录B包含了大量的表格，允许你快速为D&D故事中的人物生成名字。",
	"As you peruse the many options herein, you'll come across observations from Xanathar itself. Like the beholder's roving mind, your reading will take you to places in the game familiar and new. May you enjoy the journey!": "当你浏览这里的许多选项时，你会遇到来自Xanathar本身的观察。就像观察者的漫游思维一样，你的阅读将把你带到游戏中熟悉和新的地方。愿你享受这段旅程!",
	"Much of the material in this book originally appeared in Unearthed Arcana, a series of online articles we publish to explore rules that might officially become part of the game. Some Unearthed Arcana offerings don't end up resonating with fans and are set aside for the time being. The Unearthed Arcana material that inspired the options in the following chapters was well received and, thanks to feedback from thousands of you, has been refined into the official forms presented here.": "本书中的许多材料最初出现在《未解之谜》中，这是我们为探索可能正式成为游戏一部分的规则而发布的一系列在线文章。有些 \"未出之谜 \"的内容最终没有引起粉丝的共鸣，因此暂时被搁置。激发以下各章选项的 \"未知的阿卡纳 \"材料广受好评，并且由于你们成千上万人的反馈，已经被完善为这里的正式形式。",
	"If you're a DM, you should also know where to look things up in the dungeon master's guide, especially the rules on how magic items work (see chapter 7 of that book). The introduction of the monster manual is your guide on how to use a monster's stat block.": "如果你是一个DM，你也应该知道在哪里可以查到地下城主指南中的东西，特别是关于魔法物品如何工作的规则（见该书第7章）。怪物手册的介绍是你关于如何使用怪物的状态块的指南。",
	"One rule overrides all others: the DM is the final authority on how the rules work in play.": "有一条规则凌驾于所有其他规则之上：DM是游戏中规则如何运作的最终权威。",
	"Rules are part of what makes D&D a game, rather than just improvised storytelling. The game's rules are meant to help organize, and even inspire, the action of a D&D campaign. The rules are a tool, and we want our tools to be as effective as possible. No matter how good those tools might be, they need a group of players to bring them to life and a DM to guide their use.": "规则是D&D之所以成为游戏的一部分，而不仅仅是即兴的故事。游戏规则的目的是帮助组织，甚至激发D&D活动的行动。规则是一种工具，而我们希望我们的工具尽可能地有效。无论这些工具有多好，它们都需要一群玩家将其带入生活，并需要一个DM来指导其使用。",
	"The DM is key. Many unexpected events can occur in a D&D campaign, and no set of rules could reasonably account for every contingency. If the rules tried to do so, the game would become a slog. An alternative would be for the rules to severely limit what characters can do, which would be contrary to the open-endedness of D&D. Here's the path the game takes: it lays a foundation of rules that a DM can build on, and it embraces the DM's role as the bridge between the things the rules address and the things they don't.": "管理者是关键。在D&D活动中，可能会发生许多意想不到的事件，没有一套规则能够合理地考虑到每一个突发事件。如果规则试图这样做，游戏就会变得很费劲。另一种选择是，规则严格限制角色的行为，这与D&D的开放性相悖。这就是游戏所走的道路：它奠定了规则的基础，DM可以在此基础上建立，并且它接受DM的作用，将其作为规则所涉及的事情和它们没有涉及的事情之间的桥梁。",
	"A few rules in the core rulebooks sometimes trip up a new player or DM. Here are ten of those rules. Keeping them in mind will help you interpret the options in this book.": "核心规则手册中的一些规则有时会让新玩家或管理员感到困惑。下面是其中的十条规则。牢记这些规则将有助于你解释本书中的选项。",
	"General rules govern each part of the game. For example, the combat rules tell you that melee weapon attacks use Strength and ranged weapon attacks use Dexterity. That's a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as long as something in the game doesn't explicitly say otherwise.": "一般的规则制约着游戏的每一部分。例如，战斗规则告诉你，近战武器攻击使用力量，远程武器攻击使用灵巧。这是一条一般规则，只要游戏中没有明确的规定，一般规则就会生效。",
	"The game also includes elements-class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the like-that sometimes contradict a general rule. When an exception and a general rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a feature says you can make melee weapon attacks using your Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement disagrees with the general rule.": " 当例外情况和一般规则不一致时，例外情况获胜。例如，如果一个特征说你可以用你的魅力进行近战武器攻击，你就可以这么做，尽管这个说法与一般规则不一致。",
	"Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.": "每当你在游戏中除以或乘以一个数字时，如果你最后得到的是一个分数，即使这个分数是二分之一或更大，也要向下取整。",
	"Even if more than one factor gives you advantage or disadvantage on a roll, you have it only once, and if you have advantage and disadvantage on the same roll, they cancel each other.": "即使一个以上的因素给你带来优势或劣势，你也只拥有一次，如果你在同一卷中拥有优势和劣势，它们会相互抵消。",
	"Different game effects can affect a target at the same time. For example, two different benefits can give you a bonus to your Armor Class. But when two or more effects have the same proper name, only one of them (the most powerful one if their benefits aren't identical) applies while the durations of the effects overlap. For example, if bless is cast on you when you're still under the effect of an earlier bless, you gain the benefit of only one casting. Similarly, if you're in the radius of more than one Aura of Protection, you benefit only from the one that grants the highest bonus.": "不同的游戏效果可以同时影响一个目标。例如，两个不同的好处可以给你的装甲等级带来奖励。但当两个或更多的效果有相同的专有名词时，只有其中一个（如果它们的好处不一样，则是最强大的一个）适用，而效果的持续时间是重叠的。例如，如果在你仍处于先前的祝福效果之下时对你施放了祝福，你只能获得一次施放的好处。同样地，如果你在一个以上的保护光环的半径内，你只能从给予最高奖励的那个光环中获益。",
	"Certain game features let you take a special action, called a reaction, in response to some event. Making opportunity attacks and casting the shield spell are two typical uses of reactions. If you're unsure when a reaction occurs in relation to its trigger, here's the rule: the reaction happens after its trigger completes, unless the description of the reaction explicitly says otherwise.": "某些游戏功能可以让你采取特殊的行动，称为反应，以回应某些事件。进行机会攻击和施放盾牌咒语是反应的两个典型用途。如果你不确定反应何时发生与其触发有关，那么规则是这样的：反应在其触发完成后发生，除非反应的描述中明确指出。",
	"Once you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn.": "一旦你做出反应，在你下一回合开始之前，你不能再做出另一个反应。",
	"Here's the order that you apply modifiers to damage: (1) any relevant damage immunity, (2) any addition or subtraction to the damage, (3) one relevant damage resistance, and (4) one relevant damage vulnerability.": "以下是你对伤害施加修饰的顺序。(1)任何相关的伤害免疫，(2)对伤害的任何加减，(3)一个相关的伤害抵抗，和(4)一个相关的伤害脆弱性。",
	"Even if multiple sources give you resistance to a type of damage you're taking, you can apply resistance to it only once. The same is true of vulnerability.": "即使有多个来源给你抵抗你所受的某种类型的伤害，你也只能对它施加一次抵抗。脆弱性的情况也是如此。",
	"If your proficiency bonus applies to a roll, you can add the bonus only once to the roll, even if multiple things in the game say your bonus applies. Moreover, if more than one thing tells you to double or halve your bonus, you double it only once or halve it only once before applying it. Whether multiplied, divided, or left at its normal value, the bonus can be used only once per roll.": "如果你的熟练度加成适用于一个卷，你只能把加成加到该卷上一次，即使游戏中的多个东西都说你的加成适用。此外，如果有多件事情告诉你要将你的奖励加倍或减半，你在应用它之前只能将它加倍一次或减半一次。无论是乘以、除以，还是保持其正常值，奖金在每个卷中只能使用一次。",
	"If you want to cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 bonus action, remember that you can't cast any other spells before or after it on the same turn, except for cantrips with a casting time of 1 action.": "如果你想施放一个施放时间为1个额外行动的法术，请记住，在同一回合内，你不能在它之前或之后施放任何其他法术，除了施放时间为1个行动的咒语。",
	"As soon as you start casting a spell or using a special ability that requires concentration, your concentration on another effect ends instantly.": "只要你开始施法或使用需要集中注意力的特殊能力，你对另一个效果的注意力就会立即结束。",
	"Temporary hit points aren't cumulative. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you don't add them together, unless a game feature says you can. Instead, you decide which temporary hit points to keep.": "临时命中率是不能累积的。如果你有临时命中率并得到了更多的命中率，你不会把它们加在一起，除非有游戏特征说你可以。相反，你要决定保留哪些临时打击点数。",
	"The main figures in any D&D campaign are the characters created by the players. The heroics, folly, righteousness, and potential villainy of your characters are at the heart of the story. This chapter provides a variety of new options for them, focusing on additional subclasses for each of the classes in the player's handbook.": "任何D&D活动中的主要人物都是由玩家创造的角色。你的角色的英雄主义、愚蠢、正义和潜在的恶棍是故事的核心。本章为他们提供了各种新的选择，重点是玩家手册中每个类别的额外子类。",
	"Each class offers a character-defining choice at 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level that unlocks a series of special features, not available to the class as a whole. That choice is called a subclass. Each class has a collective term that describes its subclasses; in the fighter, for instance, the subclasses are called martial archetypes, and in the paladin, they're sacred oaths. The table below identifies each of the subclasses in this book. In addition, the section for druids presents details on how the Wild Shape feature works, and the warlock receives a collection of new choices for the class's Eldritch Invocations feature.": "每个阶级在一、二、三级都有一个定义角色的选择，可以解锁一系列的特殊功能，而这些功能是整个阶级所没有的。这种选择被称为子类。每个阶级都有一个描述其子阶级的统称；例如，在战士中，子阶级被称为武术原型，而在圣骑士中，它们是神圣的誓言。下表列出了本书中的每个子类。此外，德鲁伊的部分介绍了 \"野性之形 \"特性的工作细节，术士则为该类的 \"长生召唤 \"特性提供了一系列新的选择。",
	"Each of the class presentations leads off with advice on how to add depth and detail to your character's personality. You can use the tables in these sections as a source of inspiration, or roll a die to randomly determine a result if desired.": "每一节课的介绍都以如何为你的角色的个性增加深度和细节的建议为开端。你可以使用这些部分的表格作为灵感来源，如果需要的话，也可以通过掷骰子来随机确定一个结果。",
	"Following the subclasses, the section called \"this is your life\" presents a series of tables for adding detail to your character's backstory.": "在子类之后，名为 \"这是你的生活 \"的部分提出了一系列表格，用于为你的角色的背景故事添加细节。",
	"The chapter concludes with a selection of feats for the races in the player's handbook, offering ways to delve deeper into a character's racial identity.": "本章最后介绍了玩家手册中的一些种族特技，提供了深入了解角色的种族特性的方法。",

	"The character creation rules in the player's handbook provide all the information you need to define your character in preparation for a life of adventuring. What they don't do is account for all the circumstances that shaped your character during the years between your birth and the start of your career as a member of a class.": "玩家手册中的角色创建规则提供了所有你需要的信息，以确定你的角色，为冒险生活做准备。但它们没有考虑到在你出生和开始作为一个阶级成员的职业生涯之间的所有情况，这些情况塑造了你的角色。",
	"What did your character accomplish or experience before deciding to become an adventurer? What were the circumstances of your birth? How large is your family, and what sorts of relationships do you have with your relatives? Which people were the greatest influences on you during your formative years, for better or worse?": "在决定成为一名冒险家之前，你的角色有什么成就或经历？你出生时的情况是怎样的？你的家庭有多大，你和你的亲戚有什么样的关系？在你成长的岁月里，哪些人对你的影响最大，是好是坏？",
	"To answer these questions and more, you can use the tables and the advice in this section to compose a well-developed backstory for your character-an autobiography of sorts-that you can use to inform how you roleplay the character. Your DM can draw from this material as the campaign proceeds, creating situations and scenarios that build off your previous life experiences.": "为了回答这些问题，你可以使用本节中的表格和建议，为你的角色编写一个完善的背景故事--类似于自传，你可以用它来指导你如何扮演这个角色。在活动进行过程中，你的管理员可以利用这些材料，在你以前的生活经历的基础上创造出一些情况和场景。",
	"Even though these pages are full of tables and die rolls, they don't make up a rules system-in fact, the opposite is true. You can use as much or as little of this material as you desire, and you can make decisions in any order you want.": "尽管这些页面充满了表格和掷骰子的内容，但它们并不构成一个规则体系--事实上，情况恰恰相反。你可以根据自己的意愿使用这些材料，也可以按照自己的意愿做出决定。",
	"For instance, you might not want these tables to help you decide who your parents and siblings are, because that's among the information you've already come up with. But you can still use other parts, such as the section on life events, to provide added depth and detail.": "例如，你可能不希望这些表格帮助你决定谁是你的父母和兄弟姐妹，因为这属于你已经想好的信息。但你仍然可以使用其他部分，如关于生活事件的部分，来提供更多的深度和细节。",
	"If you're comfortable with letting the dice decide a certain fact about your character, go ahead and roll. If not, you can take charge and make the decision, choosing from among the possibilities on a table. Of course, you also have the option of disregarding the result of a die roll if it conflicts with another result. Likewise, if the text instructs you to roll on a table, that's not meant to be taken literally. You can always make your own choice.": "如果你对让骰子决定你的角色的某个事实感到舒服，就去掷吧。如果不是，你可以负责并做出决定，从桌子上的可能性中选择。当然，如果一个骰子的结果与另一个结果相冲突，你也可以选择不考虑它。同样，如果文字指示你在桌子上掷骰子，那也不意味着要按字面意思理解。你可以随时做出自己的选择。",
	"Although these tables are meant to augment the step-by-step character creation process in the player's handbook, they don't occupy a specific place in that process. You can use some of them early on-for instance, it's possible to determine your parents and other family members immediately after deciding your character's race-but you could also wait until later in the process. You might prefer to establish more facts about your character's game identity-such as your class, ability scores, and alignment-before supplementing that information with what's offered here.": "尽管这些表格是为了补充玩家手册中的逐步创建角色的过程，但它们在这个过程中并不占据特定的位置。你可以在早期使用其中的一些表格--例如，在决定了你的角色的种族之后，可以立即确定你的父母和其他家庭成员，但你也可以等到这个过程的后期。在用这里提供的信息补充这些信息之前，你可能更喜欢建立更多关于你的角色的游戏身份的事实--比如你的等级、能力分数和排列组合。",

	"But what about the act of casting a spell? Is it possible for someone to perceive that a spell is being cast in their presence? To be perceptible, the casting of a spell must involve a verbal, somatic, or material component.

	"If the need for a spell's components has been removed by a special ability, such as the sorcerer's Subtle Spell feature or the Innate Spellcasting trait possessed by many creatures, the casting of the spell is imperceptible. If an imperceptible casting produces a perceptible effect, it's normally impossible to determine who cast the spell in the absence of other evidence.": "如果对咒语成分的需求已经被一种特殊的能力所消除，例如巫师的微妙咒语特性或许多生物所拥有的先天咒语特性，那么该咒语的施放是不可察觉的。如果不可察觉的施法产生了可察觉的效果，在没有其他证据的情况下，通常无法确定是谁施法。",

	"A spell specifies what a caster can target with it: any type of creature, a creature of a certain type (humanoid or beast, for instance), an object, an area, the caster, or something else. But what happens if a spell targets something that isn't a valid target? For example, someone might cast charm person on a creature believed to be a humanoid, not knowing that the target is in fact a vampire. If this issue comes up, handle it using the following rule.": "一个法术规定了施法者可以用它来攻击什么：任何类型的生物、某种类型的生物（例如人形或野兽）、一个物体、一个区域、施法者或其他东西。但是如果一个法术的目标不是一个有效的目标，会发生什么？例如，有人可能对一个被认为是人形的生物施以魅惑，而不知道目标其实是一个吸血鬼。如果这个问题出现了，请用以下规则来处理它。",
	"If you cast a spell on someone or something that can't be affected by the spell, nothing happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to cast the spell, the slot is still expended. If the spell normally has no effect on a target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even though it didn't attempt one (giving no hint that the creature is in fact an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive that the spell did nothing to the target.": "如果你对不能被法术影响的人或物施法，该目标不会发生任何事情，但如果你用法术槽施法，该法术槽仍然会被消耗掉。如果该法术通常对一个成功施展拯救术的目标没有影响，那么这个无效的目标似乎已经成功施展了拯救术，即使它没有尝试施展（没有提示该生物实际上是一个无效的目标）。否则，你会感觉到这个法术对目标没有任何作用。",
	"The Dungeon Master's Guide includes the following short rule for using areas of effect on a grid.": "地下城管理员指南》包括以下关于在网格上使用效应区的简短规则。",
	"Choose an intersection of squares as the point of origin of an area of effect, then follow the rules for that kind of area as normal (see the \"Areas of Effect\" section in chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook). If an area of effect is circular and covers at least half a square, it affects that square.": "选择一个方块的交叉点作为一个效应区域的原点，然后按照该种区域的正常规则行事（参见《玩家手册》第10章的 \"效应区域 \"部分）。如果一个效应区是圆形的，并且至少覆盖了半个方格，那么它就会影响到那个方格。",
	"That rule works, but it can require a fair amount of on-the-spot adjudication. This section offers two alternatives for determining the exact location of an area: the template method and the token method. Both of these methods assume you're using a grid and miniatures of some sort. Because these methods can yield different results for the number of squares in a given area, it's not recommended that they be combined at the table—choose whichever method you and your players find easier or more intuitive.": "这一规则是有效的，但它可能需要相当多的现场裁决。本节为确定一个区域的确切位置提供了两种选择：模板法和令牌法。这两种方法都假定你使用的是网格和某种类型的微型模型。由于这两种方法对于给定区域内的方格数会产生不同的结果，因此不建议在桌面上将它们结合起来--请选择你和你的棋手认为更容易或更直观的方法。",
	"The template method uses two-dimensional shapes that represent different areas of effect. The aim of the method is to accurately portray the length and width of each area on the grid and to leave little doubt about which creatures are affected by it. You'll need to make these templates or find premade ones.": "模板法使用二维形状，代表不同的影响区域。该方法的目的是准确描绘网格上每个区域的长度和宽度，并对哪些生物受其影响几乎没有疑问。你需要制作这些模板或找到预制的模板。",
	"Making a template is simple. Get a piece of paper or card stock, and cut it in the shape of the area of effect you're using. Every 5 feet of the area equals 1 inch of the template's size. For example, the 20-foot-radius sphere of the fireball spell, which has a 40-foot diameter, would translate into a circular template with an 8-inch diameter.": "制作一个模板很简单。找一张纸或卡纸，按照你要使用的效果区的形状剪下来。该区域每5英尺等于模板尺寸的1英寸。例如，火球术的20英尺半径的球体，其直径为40英尺，将转化为一个直径为8英寸的圆形模板。",
	"To use an area-of-effect template, apply it to the grid. If the terrain is flat, you can lay it on the surface; otherwise, hold the template above the surface and take note of which squares it covers or partially covers. If any part of a square is under the template, that square is included in the area of effect. If a creature's miniature is in an affected square, that creature is in the area. Being adjacent to the edge of the template isn't enough for a square to be included in the area of effect; the square must be entirely or partly covered by the template.": "要使用效果区域模板，将其应用于网格。如果地形是平坦的，你可以把它放在表面上；否则，把模板放在表面上，并注意它覆盖或部分覆盖哪些方格。如果一个方格的任何部分在模板之下，该方格就包括在效果区域内。如果一个生物的迷你模型在受影响的方格内，该生物就在该区域内。仅仅与模板的边缘相邻并不足以让一个方块包括在效应区域内；该方块必须完全或部分地被模板所覆盖。",
	"You can also use this method without a grid. If you do so, a creature is included in an area of effect if any part of the miniature's base is overlapped by the template.": "你也可以不使用网格来使用这种方法。如果你这样做，如果一个生物的底座的任何部分被模板所覆盖，该生物就会被包括在一个影响区域内。",
	"When you place a template, follow all the rules in the Player's Handbook for placing the associated area of effect. If an area of effect, such as a cone or a line, originates from a spellcaster, the template should extend out from the caster and be positioned however the caster likes within the bounds of the rules.": "当你放置模板时，要遵循《玩家手册》中关于放置相关效果区域的所有规则。如果一个效果区，比如一个圆锥体或一条线，源自施法者，那么模板应该从施法者那里延伸出去，并在规则的范围内以施法者喜欢的方式定位。",
	"Diagrams 2.1 and 2.2 show the template method in action.": "图2.1和2.2显示了模板方法的作用。",
	"The token method is meant to make areas of effect tactile and fun. To use this method, grab some dice or other tokens, which you're going to use to represent your areas of effect.": "代币法的目的是使效应区具有触觉和乐趣。要使用这种方法，请拿起一些骰子或其他令牌，你要用它们来代表你的效应区。",
	"Rather than faithfully representing the shapes of the different areas of effect, this method gives you a way to create square-edged versions of them on a grid easily, as described in the following subsections.": "这种方法不是忠实地表现不同效果区域的形状，而是给你提供了一种在网格上轻松创建方形边缘版本的方法，如以下各小节所述。",
	"Every 5-foot square of an area of effect becomes a die or other token that you place on the grid. Each token goes inside a square, not at an intersection of lines. If an area's token is in a square, that square is included in the area of effect. It's that simple.": "效应区域的每一个5英尺的方块都会成为你放置在网格上的一个骰子或其他令牌。每个令牌都在一个方格内，而不是在线条的交叉点。如果一个区域的令牌在一个方格内，该方格就包括在效果区域内。就是这么简单。",
	"Diagrams 2.3 through 2.6 show this method in action, using dice as the tokens.": "图2.3至2.6显示了这种方法的作用，使用骰子作为代币。",
	"This method depicts everything using squares, and a circular area of effect becomes square in it, whether the area is a sphere, cylinder, or radius. For instance, the 10-foot radius of flame strike, which has a diameter of 20 feet, is expressed as a square that is 20 feet on a side, as shown in diagram 2.3. Diagram 2.4 shows that area with total cover inside it.": "这种方法用正方形来描绘一切，一个圆形的作用区域在其中变成了正方形，不管这个区域是球体、圆柱体还是半径。例如，火焰打击的10英尺半径，其直径为20英尺，被表示为一个边长为20英尺的正方形，如图2.3所示。图2.4显示了该区域内的总覆盖物。",
	"A cone is represented by rows of tokens on the grid, extending from the cone's point of origin. In the rows, the squares are adjoining side by side or corner to corner, as shown in diagram 2.5.

For example, a 30-foot cone contains six rows.": "一个圆锥体由网格上的一排代币表示，从圆锥体的原点开始延伸。如图2.5所示，在这些行中，方块是并排或角对角相邻的。要确定一个圆锥体所包含的行数，需要用它的长度除以5，例如，一个30英尺的圆锥体包含6行。",
	"Here's how to create the rows. Starting with a square adjacent to the cone's point of origin, place one token. The square can be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to the point of origin. In every row beyond that one, place as many tokens as you placed in the previous row, plus one more token. Place this row's tokens so that their squares each share a side with a square in the previous row. If the cone is orthogonally adjacent to the point of origin, you'll have one more token to place in the row; place it on one end or the other of the row you just created (you don't have to pick the side chosen in diagram 2.5). Keep placing tokens in this way until you've created all of the cone's rows.": "下面是创建行的方法。从与圆锥体原点相邻的一个正方形开始，放置一个令牌。这个方块可以是与原点正交或斜交的。在这之后的每一行中，放置与你在前一行中放置的相同数量的令牌，再加一个令牌。放置这一行的令牌，使它们的方格与前一行的方格共享一条边。如果圆锥体与原点正交，你将会有一个更多的令牌放在这一行中；把它放在你刚刚创建的这一行的一端或另一端（你不必选择图2.5中选择的那一面）。以这种方式继续放置令牌，直到你创建了圆锥体的所有行。",

Even though character level is important, you should also take note of each character's hit point maximum and saving throw modifiers, as well as how much damage the mightiest characters can deal with a single attack. Character level and challenge rating are good for defining the difficulty of an encounter, but they don't tell the whole story. You'll make use of these additional character statistics when you select monsters for an encounter in step 4.": "要使用这个系统建立一个遭遇战，首先要对玩家角色进行评估。这个系统使用角色的等级来决定你可以让他们对抗的生物的数量和挑战等级，而不会使战斗太难或太容易。尽管角色等级很重要，你也应该注意到每个角色的最大命中率和蓄力修饰，以及最强大的角色在一次攻击中能造成多少伤害。角色等级和挑战等级对于确定遭遇战的难度很有帮助，但它们并不能说明全部问题。当你在第4步中为遭遇战选择怪物时，你将使用这些额外的角色统计数据。",
	"Determine whether you want to create a battle that pits one creature against the characters, or if you want to use multiple monsters. If the fight is against a single opponent, your best candidate for that foe is one of the game's legendary creatures, which are designed to fill this need. If the battle involves multiple monsters, decide roughly how many creatures you want to use before continuing with step 3.": "决定你是想创造一场让一个生物对抗角色的战斗，还是想使用多个怪物。如果战斗的对手是一个人，那么你的最佳人选就是游戏中的传奇生物，它们就是为了满足这种需要而设计的。如果战斗涉及多个怪物，在继续进行第3步之前，请大致决定你要使用多少个生物。",
	"The process for building fights that feature only one legendary monster is simple. The Solo Monster Challenge Rating table shows you which challenge rating (CR) to use for a legendary creature opposing a party of four to six characters, creating a satisfying but difficult battle. For example, for a party of five 9th-level characters, a CR 12 legendary creature makes an optimal encounter.": "建立只有一个传说中的怪物的战斗的过程很简单。单独的怪物挑战等级表显示了你应该用哪一个挑战等级（CR）来对付一个由四到六个角色组成的队伍的传奇生物，从而创造一个令人满意但困难的战斗。例如，对于一个由5个9级角色组成的队伍来说，一个CR为12的传奇生物是一个最佳的遭遇战。",
	"For a more perilous battle, match up the characters with a legendary creature whose challenge rating is 1 or 2 higher than optimal. For an easy fight, use a legendary creature whose challenge rating is 3 or more lower than the challenge rating for an optimal encounter.": "如果要进行更危险的战斗，请将角色与挑战等级比最佳挑战等级高1或2的传奇生物相匹配。对于轻松的战斗，使用挑战等级比最佳遭遇的挑战等级低3或以上的传奇生物。",
	"If your encounter features multiple monsters, balancing it takes a little more work. Refer to the Multiple Monsters tables, which are broken up by level ranges, providing information for how to balance encounters for characters of 1st-5th level, 6th-10th level, 11th-15th level, and 16th-20th level.": "如果你的遭遇战有多个怪物，那么平衡它就需要多做一些工作。请参考多重怪物表，该表按等级范围划分，提供了如何平衡1-5级、6-10级、11-15级和16-20级角色的遭遇的信息。",
	"First, you need to note the challenge rating for each creature the party will face. Then, to create your encounter, find the level of each character on the appropriate table. Each table shows what a single character of a given level is equivalent to in terms of challenge rating-a value represented by a ratio that compares numbers of characters to a single monster ranked by challenge rating. The first number in each expression is the number of characters of the given level. The second number tells how many monsters of the listed challenge rating those characters are equivalent to.": "首先，你需要记下队伍将要面对的每个生物的挑战等级。然后，为了创建你的遭遇战，在相应的表格中找到每个角色的等级。每张表格都显示了一个给定级别的单个角色在挑战等级方面相当于什么--一个用比率表示的数值，该比率将角色的数量与按挑战等级排列的单个怪物进行比较。每个表达式中的第一个数字是给定级别的角色数量。第二个数字告诉我们这些角色相当于多少个列出的挑战等级的怪物。",
	"For example, reading the row for 1st-level characters from the 1st-5th Level table, we see that one 1st-level character is the equivalent of two CR 1/8 monsters or one CR 1/4 monster. The ratio reverses for higher challenge ratings, where a single monster is more powerful than a single 1st-level character. One CR 1/2 creature is equivalent to three 1st-level characters, while one CR 1 opponent is equivalent to five.": "例如，从第1-5级表中阅读第1级角色的行，我们看到一个第1级角色相当于两个CR 1/8的怪物或一个CR 1/4的怪物。这一比例在更高的挑战等级中则相反，一个怪物比一个一级角色更强大。一个CR 1/2的生物相当于三个一级角色，而一个CR 1的对手则相当于五个。",
	"Let's say you have a party of four 3rd-level characters. Using the table, you can see that one CR 2 foe is a good match for the entire party, but that the characters will likely have a hard time handling a CR 3 creature.": "比方说，你有一个由四个三级角色组成的聚会。使用该表，你可以看到一个CR 2的敌人对整个队伍来说是一个很好的匹配，但这些角色可能很难处理一个CR 3的生物。",
	"Using the same guidelines, you can mix and match challenge ratings to put together a group of creatures to oppose four 3rd-level characters. For example, you could select one CR 1 creature. That's worth two 3rd-level characters, leaving you with two characters' worth of monsters to allocate. You could then add two CR 1/4 monsters to account for one other character and one CR 1/2 monster to account for the final character. In total, your encounter has one CR 1, one CR 1/2, and two CR 1/4 creatures.": "使用同样的准则，你可以混合和匹配挑战等级，组成一组生物来对抗四个三级角色。例如，你可以选择一个CR 1的生物。这相当于两个三级角色，剩下两个角色的怪兽可以分配。然后，你可以增加两个CR 1/4的怪物来对付另外一个角色，以及一个CR 1/2的怪物来对付最后一个角色。总的来说，你的遭遇有一个CR 1，一个CR 1/2，和两个CR 1/4的生物。",
	"For groups in which the characters are of different levels, you have two options. You can group all characters of the same level together, match them with monsters, and then combine all the creatures into one encounter. Alternatively, you can determine the group's average level and treat each character as being of that level for the purpose of selecting appropriate monsters.": "对于角色等级不同的小组，你有两个选择。你可以将所有相同等级的角色组合在一起，为他们匹配怪物，然后将所有的生物组合成一个遭遇战。或者，你可以确定该组的平均等级，并将每个角色视为该等级，以便选择适当的怪物。",
	"The above guidelines are designed to create a fight that will challenge a party while still being winnable. If you want to create an easier encounter that will challenge characters but not threaten to defeat them, you can treat the party as if it were roughly one-third smaller than it is. For example, to make an easy encounter for a party of five characters, put them up against monsters that would be a tough fight for three characters. Likewise, you can treat the party as up to half again larger to build a battle that is potentially deadly, though still not likely to be an automatic defeat. A party of four characters facing an encounter designed for six characters would fall into this category.": "上述准则是为了创造一个既能挑战队伍又能赢得胜利的战斗。如果你想创造一个更容易的遭遇战，既能挑战角色，又不会威胁到他们，你可以把队伍当作比它小三分之一的样子。例如，为了给一个由五个角色组成的队伍制造一个简单的遭遇战，让他们去对付那些对三个角色来说是一场硬仗的怪物。同样地，你也可以把队伍的规模再扩大一半，以建立一场可能是致命的战斗，虽然仍不可能自动失败。一支由四个角色组成的队伍面对一个为六个角色设计的遭遇战，就属于这一类。",
	"To save space on the tables and keep them simple, some of the lower challenge ratings are missing from the higher-level tables. For low challenge ratings not appearing on the table, assume a 1:12 ratio, indicating that twelve creatures of those challenge ratings are equivalent to one character of a specific level.": "为了节省表格的空间并使其简单，一些较低的挑战等级在较高等级的表格中没有出现。对于没有出现在表格上的低挑战等级，假设为1:12的比例，表示这些挑战等级的12个生物相当于一个特定等级的角色。",
	"After using the tables from the previous step to determine the challenge ratings of the monsters in your encounter, you're ready to pick individual monsters. This process is more of an art than a science.": "在使用上一步的表格来确定遭遇战中怪物的挑战等级后，你就可以准备挑选个别的怪物了。这个过程更像是一门艺术，而不是一门科学。",
	"In addition to assessing monsters by challenge rating, it's important to look at how certain monsters might stack up against your group. Hit points, attacks, and saving throws are all useful indicators. Compare the damage a monster can deal to the hit point maximum of each character. Be wary of any monster that is capable of dropping a character with a single attack, unless you are designing the fight to be especially deadly.": "除了通过挑战等级来评估怪物外，重要的是要看某些怪物对你的团队可能产生的影响。命中率、攻击和蓄力都是有用的指标。将怪物能造成的伤害与每个角色的最大命中率进行比较。对任何能够用一次攻击击倒一个角色的怪物要保持警惕，除非你把战斗设计得特别致命。",
	"In the same way, compare the monsters' hit points to the damage output of the party's strongest characters, again looking for targets that can be killed with one blow. Having a significant number of foes drop in the first rounds of combat can make an encounter too easy.": "以同样的方式，将怪物的命中率与本方最强角色的伤害输出进行比较，再次寻找可以一击必杀的目标。在第一轮战斗中让大量的敌人倒下，会使一场遭遇战变得过于简单。",
	"Likewise, look at whether a monster's deadliest abilities call for saving throws that most of the party members are weak with, and compare the characters' offensive abilities to the monsters' saving throws.": "同样地，看看一个怪物最致命的能力是否需要大多数党员都不擅长的蓄力，并将角色的攻击能力与怪物的蓄力进行比较。",
	"If the only creatures you can choose from at the desired challenge rating aren't a good match for the characters' statistics, don't be afraid to go back to step 3. By altering your challenge rating targets and adjusting the number of creatures in the encounter, you can come up with different options for building the encounter.": "如果你能选择的唯一的生物在所需的挑战等级上与角色的统计数据不匹配，不要害怕回到第三步。通过改变你的挑战等级目标和调整遭遇战中的生物数量，你可以提出不同的选择来构建遭遇战。",
	"The events that unfold during an encounter have to do with a lot more than swinging weapons and casting spells. The most interesting confrontations also take into account the personality or behavior of the monsters, perhaps determining whether they can be communicated with or whether they're all acting in concert. Other possible factors include the nature of the physical environment, such as whether it includes obstacles or other features that might come into play, and the ever-present possibility of something unexpected taking place.": "在遭遇战中展开的事件，除了挥舞武器和施展法术外，还需要考虑很多因素。最有趣的对抗还考虑到了怪物的个性或行为，也许可以确定它们是否可以被沟通，或者它们是否都在一致行动。其他可能的因素包括物理环境的性质，例如它是否包括障碍物或其他可能发挥作用的特征，以及永远存在的发生意外事件的可能性。",
	"If you already have ideas for how to flesh out your encounter in these ways, go right ahead and finish your creation. Otherwise, take a look at the following sections for some basic advice on adding flavor elements to the simple mechanics of the fight.": "如果你已经有了如何以这些方式充实你的遭遇的想法，请继续完成你的创作。否则，请看看下面的章节，了解在简单的战斗机制中加入风味元素的一些基本建议。",
	"To address the question of a monster's personality, you can use the tables in chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, use the Monster Personality table below, or simply jot down a few notes based on a creature's Monster Manual description. During the battle, you can use these ideas to inform how you portray the monsters and their actions. To keep things simple, you can assign the same personality traits to an entire group of monsters. For example, one bandit gang might be an unruly mob of braggarts, while the members of another gang are always on edge and ready to flee at the first sign of danger.": "要解决怪物的个性问题，你可以使用《地下城主指南》第四章中的表格，使用下面的怪物个性表，或者干脆根据怪物手册的描述记下一些笔记。在战斗中，你可以利用这些想法来告知你如何描绘怪物和它们的行动。为了简单起见，你可以给一整组怪物分配相同的个性特征。例如，一个强盗团伙可能是一群不守规矩的吹牛大王，而另一个团伙的成员则总是提心吊胆，一有危险就准备逃跑。",
	"Cowardly; looking to surrender": "胆小怕事；期待投降",
	"Greedy; wants treasure": "贪婪；想要宝藏",
	"Braggart; makes a show of bravery but runs from danger": "夸夸其谈；表现得很勇敢，但却逃避危险",
	"Fanatic; ready to die fighting": "狂热者；准备战斗到死",
	"Rabble; poorly trained and easily rattled": "暴徒；训练不足，容易被激怒",
	"Brave; stands its ground": "勇敢；坚持自己的立场",
	"Joker; taunts its enemies": "小丑；嘲弄它的敌人",
	"Bully; refuses to believe it can lose": "恶霸；拒绝相信自己会输",
	"Do rivalries, hatreds, or attachments exist among the monsters in an encounter? If so, you can use such relationships to inform the monsters' behavior during combat. The death of a much-revered leader might throw its followers into a frenzy. On the other hand, a monster might decide to flee if its spouse is killed, or a mistreated toady might be eager to surrender and betray its master in return for its life.": "遭遇战中的怪物之间是否存在竞争、仇恨或依恋关系？如果是这样的话，你可以利用这种关系来告知怪物们在战斗中的行为。一个受人尊敬的领袖的死亡可能会使其追随者陷入狂热。另一方面，如果一个怪物的配偶被杀，它可能会决定逃跑，或者一个被虐待的奴仆可能会急于投降并背叛它的主人以换取自己的生命。",
	"Has a rival; wants one random ally to suffer": "有一个对手；想让一个随机的盟友受苦",
	"Is abused by others; hangs back, betrays at first opportunity": "被别人虐待；退缩，一有机会就背叛。",
	"Is worshiped; allies will die for it": "被崇拜；盟友们将为它而死",
	"Is outcast by group; its allies ignore it": "被团体抛弃；其盟友不理会它",
	"Is outcast by choice; cares only for itself": "因选择而被抛弃；只关心自己",
	"Is seen as a bully; its allies want to see it defeated": "被视为恶霸；其盟友希望看到它被打败",
	"A few elements that make a battlefield something other than a large area of flat ground can go a long way toward spicing up an encounter. Consider setting your encounter in an area that would provide challenges even if a fight were not taking place there. What potential perils or other features might draw the characters' attention, either before or during the fight? Why are monsters lurking in this area to begin with-does it offer good hiding places, for instance?": "一些使战场不再是一大片平地的元素，可以在很大程度上为遭遇战增添色彩。考虑将你的遭遇战设置在一个即使不发生战斗也能提供挑战的地区。在战斗前或战斗中，哪些潜在的危险或其他特征会引起角色的注意？为什么怪物们一开始就潜伏在这个地区--比如说，它是否提供了良好的藏身之处？",
	"To add details to an encounter area at random, look to the tables in appendix A of the dungeon master's guide to determine room and area features, potential hazards, obstacles, traps, and more.": "要随机为遭遇区添加细节，可以参考地下城主指南附录A中的表格，以确定房间和区域特征、潜在危险、障碍物、陷阱等。",
	"Consider what might happen in an encounter area if the characters were to never enter it. Do the guards serve in shifts? What other characters or monsters might visit? Do creatures gather there to eat or gossip? Are there any natural phenomena-such as strong winds, earth tremors, or rain squalls-that sometimes take place in the area? Random events can add a fun element of the unexpected to an encounter. Just when you think a fight's outcome is evident, an unforeseen event can make things more compelling.": "考虑一下，如果人物永远不进入遭遇区，可能会发生什么。守卫是轮流值班的吗？还有什么其他角色或怪物可能会来？生物是否聚集在那里吃饭或闲聊？该地区是否有任何自然现象--如强风、地动或暴雨--有时会发生？随机事件可以为遭遇战增加一个有趣的意外元素。就在你认为一场战斗的结果是显而易见的时候，一个不可预见的事件可以使事情变得更加引人注目。",
	"A number of the tables in the dungeon master's guide can suggest random events. The tables used for encounter location, weird locales, and wilderness weather in chapter 5 of that book are a good starting point for outdoor encounters. The tables in appendix A can be useful for indoor and outdoor encounters-especially the tables for obstacles, traps, and tricks. Finally, consult the random encounter tables in the next section of this book for inspiration.": "地下城主指南中的一些表格可以提示随机事件。该书第五章中用于遭遇战地点、怪异地点和荒野天气的表格是户外遭遇战的良好起点。附录A中的表格对室内和室外遭遇战都很有用--特别是障碍物、陷阱和技巧的表格。最后，请参考本书下一节中的随机遭遇表以获得灵感。",
	"The guidelines above assume that you are concerned about balance in your combat encounters and have enough time to prepare them. If you don't have much time, or if you want simpler but less precise guidelines, the Quick Matchups table below offers an alternative.": "上面的指南假定你关注战斗中的平衡，并且有足够的时间来准备。如果你没有太多时间，或者你想要更简单但不太精确的准则，下面的快速对阵表提供了一个选择。",
	"This table gives you a way to match a character of a certain level with a number of monsters. The table lists the challenge ratings to use for including one, two, and four monsters per character for each level.

	"Using the monster lists in appendix B of that book as a basis, we've built a set of tables for each environment category: arctic, coastal, desert, forest, grassland, hill, mountain, swamp, Underdark, underwater, and urban. Within each category, separate tables are provided for each of the four tiers of play: levels 1-4, 5-10, 11-16, and 17-20.": "以该书附录B中的怪物名单为基础，我们为每个环境类别建立了一套表格：北极、沿海、沙漠、森林、草原、山地、沼泽、地下城、水下和城市。在每个类别中，都为四个等级的游戏提供了单独的表格：1-4级、5-10级、11-16级、17-20级。",

They might want to flee to avoid contact, or not to approach any closer after perceiving the monsters from a distance.": "如果你让骰子随心所欲，结果出现了大量的怪物，那么在目前的情况下，产生的遭遇对人物来说可能太困难或太危险。他们可能想要逃离以避免接触，或者在远距离察觉到怪物后不要再靠近了。",
	"Of course, you also have the freedom to adjust the numbers, but it's important to remember that not every encounter involving a monster needs to result in combat. An encounter might indeed be the prelude to a battle, a parley, or some other interaction. What happens next depends on what the characters try, or what you decide is bound to occur.": "当然，你也有调整数字的自由，但重要的是要记住，并不是每一次涉及怪物的遭遇都需要导致战斗。遭遇战的确可能是战斗、谈判或其他互动的前奏。接下来会发生什么，取决于角色们的尝试，或者你决定一定会发生什么。",
	"The tables also include entries for what the dungeon master's guide calls \"encounters of a less monstrous nature.\" Many of these results cry out to be customized or detailed, which offers you an opportunity to connect them to the story of your campaign.

	"Some traps are designed to slow down enemies, giving a dungeon's inhabitants time to mount a defense or flee. The hidden pit is a classic example of this kind of trap. A 10-foot-deep pit usually deals little damage and is easy to escape, but it serves its purpose by impeding intruders. Other examples of delaying traps include collapsing walls, a portcullis that drops from the ceiling, and a locking mechanism that shuts and bars a door.": "有些陷阱是为了减缓敌人的速度，让地牢里的居民有时间进行防御或逃跑。暗坑是这种陷阱的一个典型例子。一个10英尺深的坑通常不会造成什么伤害，而且很容易逃脱，但它通过阻碍入侵者来达到其目的。其他拖延性陷阱的例子包括坍塌的墙壁、从天花板上掉下来的门闩，以及关闭门闩的锁定装置。",
	"If a delaying trap has moving parts that directly threaten characters when they operate, the characters are usually required to make Dexterity saving throws to avoid harm.": "如果一个延迟陷阱有移动的部件，在操作时直接威胁到角色，通常需要角色进行灵巧反射以避免伤害。",
	"A restraining trap tries to keep its victims in place, leaving them unable to move. Such traps are often employed in conjunction with regular guard patrols, so that victims are periodically extricated and taken away to be dealt with. But in an ancient dungeon, the guards might be long gone.": "限制性陷阱试图将受害者留在原地，让他们无法移动。这种陷阱通常与定期的守卫巡逻结合使用，这样受害者就会定期被解救出来并被带走处理。但在古代地牢中，守卫可能早已不在。",
	"Restraining traps usually require a successful Strength saving throw to be avoided, but some don't allow saving throws. In addition to dealing damage, a restraining trap also renders a creature unable to move.

Examples include a bear trap, a cage that drops from a ceiling, and a device that flings a net.": "限制性陷阱通常需要成功的力量投掷才能避免，但有些不允许投掷。除了造成伤害之外，限制性陷阱还使生物无法移动。随后成功地进行力量检查（使用陷阱的蓄力DC）或对陷阱造成伤害可以打破它并释放被俘者。这方面的例子包括捕熊器、从天花板上掉下来的笼子和抛出网子的装置。",
	"Some traps are designed to eliminate intruders, plain and simple. Their effects include poisoned needles that spring out when a lock is tampered with, blasts of fire that fill a room, poison gas, and other lethal measures. Saving throws-usually Dexterity or Constitution-allow creatures to avoid or mitigate the trap's effects.": "有些陷阱是为了消灭入侵者，简单明了。它们的效果包括当锁被破坏时弹出的毒针、充满房间的火焰、毒气和其他致命的措施。拯救动作--通常是灵巧或宪法--允许生物避免或减轻陷阱的影响。",
	"Before creating a trap's effects, think about its level and its lethality.": "在创造一个陷阱的效果之前，要考虑它的级别和它的杀伤力。",
	"Traps are divided into four level ranges: 1-4, 5-10, 11-16, and 17-20. The level you choose for a trap gives you a starting point for determining its potency.": "陷阱被分为四个等级范围。1-4，5-10，11-16，和17-20。你为一个陷阱选择的等级给你一个确定其效力的起点。",
	"To further delineate the trap's strength, decide whether it is a moderate, dangerous, or deadly threat to characters in its level range. A moderate trap is unlikely to kill a character. A dangerous trap typically deals enough damage that a character hit by one is eager for healing. A deadly trap might reduce a creature to 0 hit points in one shot, and leaves most creatures hit by it in need of a short or long rest.": "为了进一步界定陷阱的强度，决定它对其等级范围内的角色是适度的、危险的、还是致命的威胁。一个中等强度的陷阱不太可能杀死一个角色。一个危险的陷阱通常会造成足够的伤害，被它击中的角色会急于得到治疗。一个致命的陷阱可能会在一次射击中把一个生物的命中率降到0，并使大多数被它击中的生物需要短期或长期的休息。",
	"Consult the following tables when determining a trap's effects. The Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table provides guidelines for a trap's saving throw DC, check DC, and attack bonus. The check DC is the default for any check used to interact with the trap.": "在确定一个陷阱的效果时，请参考以下表格。陷阱蓄力DC和攻击奖励表为陷阱的蓄力DC、检查DC和攻击奖励提供了指导。检查DC是用于与陷阱互动的任何检查的默认值。",
	"The Damage Severity by Level table lists the typical damage a trap deals at certain character levels. The damage values given assume that the trap damages one creature. Use d6s for damage in place of d10s for traps that can affect more than one creature at a time.": "伤害严重程度表列出了一个陷阱在某些角色等级下的典型伤害。所给出的伤害值是假设陷阱伤害的是一个生物。对于可以同时影响一个以上的生物的陷阱，使用d6来代替d10的伤害。",
	"The Spell Equivalent by Level table shows the spell slot level that is appropriate for a given character level and the severity of danger posed by the trap. A spell is a great foundation to use as the design of a trap, whether the trap duplicates the spell (a mirror that casts charm person on whoever looks into it) or uses its effects (an alchemical device that explodes like a fireball).": "按等级划分的法术等价表显示了适合给定角色等级的法术槽等级以及陷阱所带来的危险的严重程度。法术是设计陷阱的一个很好的基础，无论陷阱是复制法术（一面对着镜子的人施展魅力的镜子）还是使用其效果（一个像火球一样爆炸的炼金装置）。",
	"The Deadly entry for characters of 17th level or higher suggests combining a 9th-level and a 5th-level spell into one effect. In this case, pick two spells, or combine the effects of a spell cast using a 9th-level and a 5th-level slot. For instance, a fireball spell of this sort would deal {@dice 24d6} fire damage on a failed saving throw.": "17级以上的人物的致命条目建议将一个9级和一个5级的法术合并为一个效果。在这种情况下，可以选择两个法术，或者结合使用9级和5级法术槽的法术效果。例如，这种火球术会在蓄力失败时造成{@dice 24d6}的火焰伤害。",

	"Decide what causes the trap to activate and determine how the characters can find the trigger. Here are some example triggers:": "决定是什么导致了陷阱的启动，并决定角色如何找到触发器。这里有一些触发器的例子。",
	"A pressure plate that, when it is stepped on, activates the trap": "一个压力板，当它被踩到时，就会激活陷阱。",
	"A trip wire that springs a trap when it is broken, usually when someone walks through it": "绊马索，当它被破坏时，通常当有人走过它时，它就会弹出一个陷阱。",
	"A doorknob that activates a trap when it is turned the wrong way": "一个门把手，当它转错方向时，会启动一个陷阱",
	"A door or chest that triggers a trap when it is opened": "一扇门或一个箱子，当它被打开时，会触发一个陷阱。",
	"A trigger usually needs to be hidden to be effective. Otherwise, avoiding the trap is usually easy.": "触发器通常需要被隐藏起来才会有效。否则，避开陷阱通常很容易。",
	"The DC of the check, regardless of its type, depends on the skill and care taken to conceal the trap. Most traps can be detected with a successful DC 20 check, but a crudely made or hastily built trap has a DC of 15. Exceptionally devious traps might have a DC of 25.": "检查的DC，无论其类型如何，都取决于隐藏陷阱的技巧和小心程度。大多数陷阱都可以通过成功的DC20检定被发现，但是粗制滥造或仓促建造的陷阱的DC为15。特别狡猾的陷阱可能有25的DC。",
	"You must then put some thought into what the characters learn with a successful check. In most cases, the check reveals the trap. In other cases, it uncovers clues, but foiling the trap still requires some deduction. The characters might succeed on the check but still trigger the trap if they don't understand what they have learned.": "然后，你必须对人物在检查成功后学到的东西进行一些思考。在大多数情况下，检查揭示了陷阱。在其他情况下，它发现了一些线索，但是挫败陷阱仍然需要一些推理。角色可能会检查成功，但如果他们不理解他们所学到的东西，仍然会触发陷阱。",
	"Designing a trap's effects is a straightforward process. The tables for saving throw DCs, attack bonuses, damage, and the like give you a starting point for most simple traps that deal damage.": "设计一个陷阱的效果是一个简单的过程。蓄力DC、攻击加成、伤害和类似的表格给你提供了一个大多数简单陷阱的伤害起点。",
	"For traps with more complex effects, your best starting point is to use the Spell Equivalent by Level table to find the best match for your trap's intended effect. Spells are a good starting point because they are compact pieces of game design that deliver specific effects.": "对于具有更复杂效果的陷阱，你最好的出发点是使用按等级划分的法术等价表来找到与你的陷阱预期效果的最佳匹配。法术是一个很好的起点，因为它们是游戏设计中的紧凑部分，可以提供特定的效果。",
	"If you are using a spell as a starting point, check to see if you need to tweak its effects to fit the trap's nature. For instance, you can easily change the damage type a spell delivers or the saving throw it requires.": "如果你使用一个法术作为起点，检查一下你是否需要调整其效果以适应陷阱的性质。例如，你可以很容易地改变法术的伤害类型或它所要求的救赎方式。",
	"Only one successful ability check is required to disarm a simple trap. Imagine how your trap operates, and then think about how the characters could overcome it. More than one kind of ability check might be possible. Some traps are so poorly concealed that they can be discovered or circumvented without active effort. For instance, a hidden pit trap is effectively disarmed as soon as the characters notice it. After that, they can simply walk around it, or they can climb down one side, walk across the bottom of the pit, and climb up the other side.": "要解除一个简单的陷阱，只需要一次成功的能力检查。想象一下你的陷阱是如何运作的，然后想一想角色们如何才能克服它。不止一种能力检查是可能的。有些陷阱的隐蔽性很差，不需要积极努力就能发现或绕开。例如，一个隐蔽的坑道陷阱在人物注意到它的时候就会被有效解除。之后，他们可以简单地绕过它，或者他们可以从一边爬下来，走过坑的底部，然后从另一边爬上去。",
	"Once you determine how a trap can be disarmed or avoided, decide the appropriate ability and skill combinations that characters can use. A Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|phb}, a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check, and an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check are all commonly used for this purpose.": "一旦你确定了如何解除或避开一个陷阱，就要决定角色可以使用的适当的能力和技能组合。使用{@item thieves' tools|phb}的灵巧检查、力量({@skill Athletics})检查和智力({@skill Arcana})检查都是常用于此目的。",
	"A Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|phb} can apply to any trap that has a mechanical element. {@item Thieves' tools|phb} can be used to disable a trip wire or a pressure plate, disassemble a poison needle mechanism, or clog a valve that leaks poisonous gas into a room.": "使用{@item thieves' tools|phb}的灵巧检查可以适用于任何有机械元素的陷阱。(1%）可以用来解除绊线或压板，拆卸毒针装置，或堵塞向房间泄漏毒气的阀门。",
	"A Strength check is often the method for thwarting traps that can be destroyed or prevented from operating through the use of brute force. A scything blade can be broken, a sliding block can be held in place, or a net can be torn apart.": "力量检查通常是挫败陷阱的方法，这些陷阱可以通过使用蛮力来破坏或阻止其运作。镰刀可以被折断，滑块可以被固定住，或者网可以被撕开。",
	"A magic trap can be disabled by someone who can undermine the magic used to power it. Typically, a successful Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check enables a character to figure out how a magic trap functions and how to negate its effect. For instance, the character could discover that a statue that belches a jet of magical flame can be disabled by shattering one of its glass eyes.": "一个魔法陷阱可以被那些能够破坏用来驱动它的魔法的人所禁用。通常情况下，成功的智力检查可以让一个角色弄清楚魔法陷阱的功能以及如何消除它的效果。例如，这个角色可以发现，一个喷出魔法火焰的雕像可以通过打碎它的一只玻璃眼睛而失效。",
	"Once you know what kind of check is called for, you then determine what happens on a failed attempt to disable the trap. Depending on the kind of check involved and the nature of the trap, you might determine that any failed check has negative consequences-usually involving the triggering of the trap. At other times, you could assign a number that the check must exceed to prevent the trap from going off. If the total of the check is equal to or lower than that number, the trap activates.": "一旦你知道需要什么样的检查，你就可以确定在试图解除陷阱的失败后会发生什么。根据所涉及的检查种类和陷阱的性质，你可能会决定任何检查失败都会产生负面的后果--通常涉及到陷阱的触发。在其他时候，你可以指定一个数字，检查必须超过这个数字才能防止陷阱爆炸。如果检查的总数等于或低于这个数字，陷阱就会启动。",
	"Context and environment are critical when it comes to properly locating a trap. A swinging log trap that's meant to knock characters aside is a mere inconvenience on a typical forest path, where it can be easily circumvented. But it's a potentially deadly hazard on a narrow trail that hugs the side of a towering cliff face.": "当涉及到正确定位一个陷阱时，背景和环境是至关重要的。在典型的森林小径上，一个旨在将人物打到一边的摇摆的木头陷阱只是一个不便之处，在那里它可以很容易地被绕过。但是，在一条紧贴高耸的悬崖边的狭窄小路上，它却是一个潜在的致命危险。",
	"Choke points and narrow passages that lead to important places in a dungeon are good spots for traps, especially those that serve as alarms or restraints. The goal is to foil or delay intruders before they can reach a critical location, giving the dungeon's denizens a chance to mount a defense or a counterattack.": "通往地牢重要地点的咽喉和狭窄的通道是设置陷阱的好地方，特别是那些作为警报器或约束装置的陷阱。其目的是在入侵者到达关键位置之前挫败或拖延他们，让地牢的居民有机会进行防御或反击。",
	"A treasure chest, a door leading to a vault, or any other obstacle or container that bars the way to a valuable treasure is the ideal location for a slaying trap. In such instances, the trap is the last line of defense against a thief or intruder.": "一个宝箱，一扇通往金库的门，或任何其他阻碍通往珍贵宝藏的障碍物或容器，都是设置杀戮陷阱的理想地点。在这种情况下，陷阱是对付小偷或入侵者的最后一道防线。",
	"Alarm traps, since they pose no direct physical threat, are appropriate for areas that are also used by a dungeon's denizens-assuming the residents know about the trap and how to avoid setting it off. Accidents can happen, but if a goblin stumbles inside its den and activates an alarm trap, there's no real harm done. The alarm sounds, the guards arrive, they punish the clumsy goblin, and they reset the trap.": "警报陷阱，因为它们不构成直接的物理威胁，所以适合于地牢居民使用的区域--假设居民知道这个陷阱以及如何避免触发它的话。意外可能会发生，但如果一个地精在它的巢穴里跌跌撞撞地启动了警报陷阱，也不会造成真正的伤害。警报响起，守卫赶到，他们惩罚了这个笨拙的妖精，并重新设置了陷阱。",
	"A complex trap poses multiple dangers to adventurers. After a complex trap activates, it remains dangerous round after round until the characters avoid it or disable it. Some complex traps become more dangerous over time, as they accumulate power or gain speed.": "一个复杂的陷阱会给冒险者带来多种危险。在一个复杂的陷阱启动后，它仍然是一轮又一轮的危险，直到人物避开它或使它失效。一些复杂的陷阱随着时间的推移会变得更加危险，因为它们会积累力量或获得速度。",
	"Complex traps are also more difficult to disable than simple ones. A single check is not enough. Instead, a series of checks is required to slowly disengage the trap's components. The trap's effect degrades with each successful check until the characters finally deactivate it.": "复杂的陷阱也比简单的陷阱更难解除。单一的检查是不够的。相反，需要一系列的检查来慢慢解除陷阱的组件。每次检查成功后，陷阱的效果就会减弱，直到人物最终将其解除。",
	"Most complex traps are designed so that they can be disarmed only by someone who is exposed to the trap's effect. For example, the mechanism that controls a hallway filled with scything blades is on the opposite end from the entrance, or a statue that bathes an area in necrotic energy can be disabled only by someone standing in the affected area.": "大多数复杂的陷阱都被设计成只有暴露在陷阱效果下的人才能解除它们。例如，控制充满镰刀的走廊的装置在入口的另一端，或者使一个区域沐浴在坏死能量中的雕像，只有站在受影响区域的人才能解除。",

	"A complex trap uses the same level and severity designations that a simple trap does.": "复杂的陷阱使用与简单的陷阱相同的等级和严重程度指定。",
	"Just like a simple trap, a complex trap has a trigger. Some complex traps have multiple triggers.": "就像一个简单的陷阱，一个复杂的陷阱也有一个触发器。有些复杂的陷阱有多个触发器。",
	"A complex trap takes turns as a creature does, because it functions over a period of time. This part of a trap's description tells whether the trap is slow (acts on initiative count 10), fast (acts on initiative count 20), or very fast (acts on initiative count 20 and also initiative count 10). A trap always acts after creatures that have the same initiative count.": "一个复杂的陷阱会像生物一样轮流行动，因为它是在一段时期内发挥作用。陷阱描述的这一部分告诉我们，这个陷阱是缓慢的（在主动性计数为10时行动），快速的（在主动性计数为20时行动），还是非常快速的（在主动性计数为20和主动性计数为10时行动）。陷阱总是在具有相同主动性计数的生物之后行动。",
	"On a trap's turn, it produces specific effects that are detailed in this part of its description. The trap might have multiple active elements, a table you roll on to determine its effect at random, or options for you to choose from.": "在一个陷阱的回合中，它会产生特定的效果，这些效果在其描述的这一部分中有详细说明。陷阱可能有多个活动元素，你可以通过滚动表来随机决定其效果，或者供你选择的选项。",
	"A dynamic element is a threat that arises or evolves while the trap functions. Usually, changes involving dramatic elements take effect at the end of each of the trap's turns or in response to the characters' actions.": "动态元素是指在陷阱运作时出现或演变的威胁。通常，涉及戏剧性元素的变化在陷阱的每个回合结束时生效，或对人物的行动做出反应。",
	"A complex trap poses a threat even when it is not taking its turn. The constant elements describe how these parts of the trap function. Most make an attack or force a saving throw against any creature that ends its turn within a certain area.": "一个复杂的陷阱即使在不轮到它的时候也会构成威胁。恒定元素描述了陷阱的这些部分是如何运作的。大多数会对任何在某一区域内结束其回合的生物进行攻击或强迫其进行投掷。",

	"Disabling a complex trap is like disarming a simple trap, except that a complex trap requires more checks. It typically takes three successful checks to disable one of a complex trap's elements. Many of these traps have multiple elements, requiring a lot of work to shut down every part of the trap. Usually, a successful check reduces a trap element's effectiveness even if it doesn't disable the trap.": "解除一个复杂的陷阱就像解除一个简单的陷阱一样，只不过复杂的陷阱需要更多的检查。通常需要三次成功的检查才能解除一个复杂陷阱的元素。许多这样的陷阱有多个元素，需要大量的工作来关闭陷阱的每个部分。通常情况下，一个成功的检查会降低陷阱元素的有效性，即使它没有使陷阱失效。",
	"A complex trap functions in play much like a legendary monster. When it is activated, the trap's active elements act according to its initiative. On each of its initiative counts, after all creatures with that same initiative count have acted, the trap's features activate. Apply the effects detailed in the trap's description.": "一个复杂的陷阱在游戏中的功能很像一个传说中的怪物。当它被激活时，陷阱的活跃元素会根据其主动性而行动。在它的每一次主动性计数中，在所有具有相同主动性计数的生物都行动之后，陷阱的特征就会被激活。应用陷阱描述中详述的效果。",
	"After resolving the effects of the trap's active elements, check its dynamic elements to see if anything changes about the trap. Many complex traps have effects that vary during an encounter. A magical aura might do more damage the longer it is active, or a swinging blade might change which area of a chamber it attacks.": "在解决了陷阱的活动元素的效果之后，检查它的动态元素，看看这个陷阱是否有什么变化。许多复杂的陷阱在遭遇战中都有不同的效果。一个神奇的光环可能会在活动时间越长的情况下造成更多的伤害，或者一个挥舞的刀片可能会改变它所攻击的房间的哪个区域。",
	"The trap's constant elements allow it to have effects when it isn't the trap's turn. At the end of each creature's turn, look at the trap's constant elements to see if any of their effects are triggered.": "陷阱的恒定元素允许它在不是陷阱的回合时有效果。在每个生物的回合结束时，查看陷阱的常量元素，看它们的任何效应是否被触发。",
	"Overcoming a complex trap merits an experience point award, depending on the danger it poses. Judging whether a party has overcome a trap requires some amount of adjudication.

	"A complex trap has multiple parts, typically relies on the characters' positions to resolve some of its effects, and can bring several effects to bear in each round. The traps are called complex for a reason! To begin the design process, consider drawing a map of the area to be affected by the trap on graph paper, using a scale of 5 feet per square. This level of detail allows you to develop a clear idea of what the trap can do and how each of its parts interact. Your map is the starting point and context for the rest of the design process.": "一个复杂的陷阱有多个部分，通常依靠角色的位置来解决它的一些效果，并且在每一轮中可以带来几个效果。陷阱被称为复杂是有原因的! 要开始设计过程，可以考虑在图画纸上画出受陷阱影响的区域的地图，比例尺为每平方5英尺。这种程度的细节可以让你对陷阱的作用以及它的每个部分如何相互作用有一个清晰的概念。你的地图是其余设计过程的起点和背景。",
	"Don't limit yourself to one room. Look at the passages and rooms around the area of the trap and think about the role they can play. The trap might cause doors to lock and barriers to fall into place to prevent escape. It could cause darts to fire from the walls in one area, forcing characters to enter rooms where other devices trigger and threaten them.": "不要把自己局限于一个房间。看看陷阱周围的通道和房间，想想它们能起到什么作用。陷阱可能会导致门被锁住，障碍物落在原地以防止逃跑。它可以使飞镖从一个区域的墙上射出，迫使人物进入其他装置触发并威胁他们的房间。",
	"Consider how terrain and furniture can add to the trap's danger. A chasm or a pit might create a buffer that allows a trap to send bolts of magic at the characters, while making it difficult or even impossible for them to reach the runes they must deface to foil that attack.": "考虑地形和家具如何能增加陷阱的危险性。鸿沟或深坑可能会产生一个缓冲区，使陷阱能够向人物发出魔法，同时使他们难以甚至不可能接触到他们必须破坏的符文以阻止攻击。",
	"Think of your map like a script. Where do the characters want to go? What does the trap protect? How can the characters get there? What are their likely escape routes? Answering these questions tells you where the trap's various elements should be placed.": "把你的地图想象成一个剧本。人物想去哪里？陷阱保护的是什么？人物如何到达那里？他们可能的逃跑路线是什么？回答了这些问题，你就可以知道陷阱的各种元素应该放在哪里。",
	"A complex trap's active elements work the same way as a simple trap's effects, except that a complex trap activates in every round. Otherwise, the guidelines for picking saving throw DCs, attack bonuses, and damage are the same. To make your trap logically consistent, make sure the elements you design can activate each round. For instance, ordinary crossbows rigged to fire at the characters would need a mechanism for reloading them between attacks.": "一个复杂的陷阱的活性元素与简单陷阱的效果相同，只是复杂的陷阱在每一回合都会激活。除此之外，选择救赎DC、攻击奖励和伤害的准则都是一样的。为了使你的陷阱在逻辑上保持一致，要确保你设计的元素每轮都能激活。例如，普通的十字弓被安装在人物身上，就需要一个在攻击之间重新装弹的机制。",
	"In terms of lethality, it's better to have multiple dangerous effects in a trap than a single deadly one. For example, the Path of Blades trap uses two dangerous elements and one moderate element.": "就杀伤力而言，在一个陷阱里有多种危险效果比单一的致命效果要好。例如，\"刀锋之路 \"陷阱使用两个危险元素和一个适度元素。",
	"It's useful to create multiple active elements, with each affecting a different area. It's also a good idea to use a variety of effects. Some parts of the trap might deal damage, and others might immobilize characters or isolate them from the rest of the party. A bashing lever might knock characters into an area engulfed by jets of flame. Think about how the elements can work together.": "创建多个活动元素是很有用的，每个元素影响不同的区域。使用各种效果也是一个好主意。陷阱的某些部分可能会造成伤害，而其他部分可能会使角色不能动弹，或使他们与其他成员隔离。撞击杆可能会把人物撞到一个被火焰喷射物吞没的区域。想一想这些元素如何共同发挥作用。",
	"In addition to the active steps a complex trap takes, it should also present a continual hazard. Often, the active and constant effects are the same thing. Imagine a hallway filled with whirling saw blades. On the trap's turn, the blades attack anyone in the hall. In addition, anyone who lingers in the hallway takes damage at the end of each of their turns, accounting for the constant threat that the blades pose.": "除了一个复杂的陷阱所采取的主动步骤外，它还应该呈现出持续的危害。通常，主动和持续的影响是同一件事。想象一下，在一条走廊上充满了旋转的锯条。在陷阱的转弯处，刀片会攻击走廊里的任何人。此外，任何在走廊里逗留的人在每个回合结束时都会受到伤害，这就说明了刀片所带来的持续威胁。",
	"A constant element should apply its effect to any creature that ends its turn in that element's area. If an active element presents a threat when it isn't the trap's turn, define the threat it poses as a constant element. As a rule of thumb, keep the saving throw DC or attack bonus the same as for the active element but reduce the damage by half.": "一个恒定元素应该对任何在该元素区域内结束其回合的生物施加其效果。如果一个主动元素在不是陷阱的回合时产生了威胁，那么就把它所产生的威胁定义为一个恒定元素。作为一个经验法则，保持与主动元素相同的蓄力DC或攻击奖励，但减少一半的伤害。",
	"Avoid filling the entire encounter area with constant elements. Part of the challenge of a complex trap lies in figuring out which areas are safe. A moment's respite can help add an element of pacing to an encounter with a complex trap and give the characters the feeling that they aren't in constant peril. For example, walls that slam together might need to reset between slams, making them harmless when it isn't their turn to act.": "避免用不变的元素填满整个遭遇区。复杂陷阱的部分挑战在于弄清楚哪些区域是安全的。在遇到复杂的陷阱时，片刻的喘息可以帮助增加节奏的元素，让角色感觉到他们并不是一直处于危险之中。例如，撞在一起的墙可能需要在两次撞墙之间进行重置，当轮不到他们行动时，他们就不会受到伤害。",
	"Just as a battle is more interesting if the monsters change their tactics or unveil new abilities in later rounds, so too are complex traps more fun if their nature changes in some way. The whirling blades that protect a treasure chest do more damage each round as they speed up. The poison gas in a room grows thicker as more of it floods the chamber, dealing greater damage and affecting line of sight. The necrotic aura around an idol of Demogorgon produces random effects each time its active element is triggered. As water floods a chamber, the characters must swim across areas they could walk through just a round or two earlier.": "就像一场战斗如果在后面的回合中怪物改变了战术或展现了新的能力就会更有趣一样，复杂的陷阱如果在某种程度上改变了性质也会更有趣。保护宝箱的旋转刀片随着速度的加快，每回合都会造成更大的伤害。房间里的毒气随着越来越多的毒气涌入房间而变得越来越浓，造成更大的伤害并影响视线。德摩根神像周围的死灵光环在每次触发其活性元素时产生随机效果。当水淹没密室时，角色必须游过他们在一两轮前可以走过的地方。",
	"Since a complex trap remains active over the course of several rounds, it might be possible to predict its future behavior by examining how it functions. This information can give its targets a much better chance of thwarting it. To minimize this possibility, design your trap so that it presents multiple threats that can change each round. The changes can include how a trap targets creatures (different attacks or saving throws), the damage or effects it produces, the areas it covers, and so on. Some traps might have a random effect each round, while others follow a carefully programmed sequence of attacks.": "由于一个复杂的陷阱在几个回合的过程中保持活跃，通过检查它的功能，也许有可能预测它的未来行为。这些信息可以使其目标有更大的机会挫败它。为了尽量减少这种可能性，设计你的陷阱，使其呈现出多种威胁，每一轮都会发生变化。这些变化可以包括陷阱如何针对生物（不同的攻击或蓄力），它产生的伤害或效果，它覆盖的区域，等等。有些陷阱可能每轮都有随机的效果，而有些陷阱则遵循精心设计的攻击顺序。",
	"Dynamic elements usually occur according to a schedule.": "动态元素通常按照时间表发生。",
	"For a room that floods, you can plan out how the rising water level affects the area each round. The water might be ankle deep at the end of the first round, knee deep the next, and so on. Not only does the water bring a risk of drowning, it also makes it harder to move across the area. On the other hand, the rising water level might allow characters to swim to the upper reaches of the chamber that they couldn't get to from the floor.": "对于一个淹水的房间，你可以计划出每一轮水位上升对该区域的影响。第一轮结束时，水可能深至脚踝，下一轮则深至膝盖，以此类推。水不仅带来了溺水的风险，还使整个区域的移动更加困难。另一方面，水位的上升可能会让角色游到他们无法从地面到达的密室的上游。",
	"Dynamic elements can also come into play in reaction to the characters' actions. Disarming one element of the trap might make the others deadlier. Disabling a rune that triggers a fire-breathing statue might cause the statue to explode.": "动态元素也可以根据人物的行动来发挥作用。解除陷阱中的一个元素可能会使其他元素更加致命。解除触发喷火雕像的符文可能导致雕像爆炸。",
	"The advice on triggers given for simple traps also applies to complex traps, with one exception. Complex traps have multiple triggers, or are designed such that avoiding a trigger prevents intruders from reaching the area the trap guards. Other complex traps use magical triggers that activate on specific cues, such as when a door opens or someone enters an area without wearing the correct badge, amulet, or robe.": "关于简单陷阱的触发器的建议也适用于复杂陷阱，但有一个例外。复杂的陷阱有多个触发器，或者被设计成避开一个触发器就能阻止入侵者到达陷阱所守护的区域。其他复杂的陷阱使用魔法触发器，在特定的提示下启动，例如当门打开或者有人在没有佩戴正确的徽章、护身符或长袍的情况下进入某个区域。",
	"Look at your map and consider when you want the trap to spring into action. It's best to have a complex trap trigger after the characters have committed to exploring an area. A simple trap might activate when the characters open a door. A complex trap that triggers so early leaves the characters still outside the trapped room, in a place where they could decide to close the door and move on. A simple trap aims to keep intruders out. A complex trap wants to lure them in, so that when it activates, the intruders must deal with the trap before they can escape.": "看一下你的地图，考虑你希望陷阱何时开始行动。最好是让复杂的陷阱在人物致力于探索一个区域后触发。一个简单的陷阱可能在人物打开门的时候启动。一个复杂的陷阱如果这么早触发，就会使角色仍然在被困住的房间外，在一个他们可以决定关门和继续前进的地方。一个简单的陷阱旨在将入侵者拒之门外。一个复杂的陷阱想要引诱他们进来，所以当它启动时，入侵者必须在逃跑之前处理好这个陷阱。",
	"The trigger for a complex trap should be as foolproof as you can make it. A complex trap represents a serious expenditure of effort and magical power. No one builds such a trap and makes it easy to avoid. Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) and Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) checks might be unable to spot a trigger, especially a magical one, but they can still give hints about the trap before it triggers. Bloodstains, ashes, gouges in the floor, and other clues of that sort can serve as evidence of the trap's presence.": "复杂陷阱的触发器应该是你能做到的万无一失。一个复杂的陷阱代表着严重的努力和魔力的支出。没有人建立这样的陷阱并让它容易躲避。智慧（{@skill Perception}）和智力（{@skill Investigation}）检查可能无法发现一个触发器，尤其是一个魔法触发器，但是它们仍然可以在触发之前给出关于陷阱的提示。血迹、灰烬、地板上的凹痕，以及其他类似的线索都可以作为陷阱存在的证据。",
	"A complex trap acts repeatedly, but unlike characters and monsters, traps don't roll for initiative. As mechanical or magical devices, their active elements operate in a periodic manner. When designing a complex trap, you need to decide when and how often its active elements produce their effects.": "一个复杂的陷阱会重复行动，但与角色和怪物不同的是，陷阱不需要掷出主动权。作为机械或魔法装置，它们的活性元素以一种周期性的方式运作。当设计一个复杂的陷阱时，你需要决定它的活性元素何时以及多长时间产生效果。",
	"In a trap with multiple active elements that work in concert, those different elements would act on different initiative counts. For instance, on initiative count 20, blades sweep across a treasure vault, driving the characters back into the hallway. On initiative count 10, magic darts fire from statues in the hallway while a portcullis falls to confine the characters.": "在一个有多个活跃元素协同工作的陷阱中，这些不同的元素会在不同的主动权计数上发挥作用。例如，在主动权计数20的时候，刀片横扫宝库，将角色赶回走廊。在主动权计数10的时候，魔法飞镖从走廊上的雕像中发射出来，同时一个舷窗落下，限制了角色。",
	"If a trap's active element takes time to build up its effects, then it acts on initiative count 10. This option is good for a trap that functions alongside allied monsters or other guardians; the delay before it acts can give guards the chance to move out of its area or force characters into the area before the trap triggers.": "如果一个陷阱的主动元素需要时间来建立它的效果，那么它就会在主动计数10时采取行动。这个选项适合于与盟军怪物或其他守护者一起发挥作用的陷阱；在它行动之前的延迟可以让守卫有机会离开它的区域，或者在陷阱触发之前迫使角色进入该区域。",
	"If an element is designed to surprise intruders and hit them before they can react, then it acts on initiative count 20. This option is generally best for a complex trap. Think of it as the default. Such a trap acts quickly enough to take advantage of most characters, with nimble characters like rogues, rangers, and monks having the best chance to move out of the area before the element activates.": "如果一个元素被设计用来突袭入侵者，并在他们做出反应之前击中他们，那么它就按主动性计数20行事。这个选项通常是复杂陷阱的最佳选择。可以把它看作是默认的。这样的陷阱行动迅速，足以利用大多数角色，像流氓、游侠和僧侣这样灵活的角色有最好的机会在元素激活前离开这个区域。",
	"Some active elements are incredibly fast acting, laying waste to intruders in a few moments unless countered. They act on initiative count 20 and 10.": "一些活性元素的行动速度非常快，除非遭到反击，否则在片刻之间就能将入侵者消灭。他们在主动性计数20和10时采取行动。",
	"A complex trap is never defeated with a single check. Instead, each successful check foils some part of it or degrades its performance. Each element of the trap must be overcome individually to defeat the trap as a whole.": "一个复杂的陷阱永远不会被一个单一的检查所打败。相反，每一次成功的检查都会挫败它的某些部分或降低其性能。陷阱的每一个元素都必须被单独克服，才能从整体上击败这个陷阱。",
	"As part of determining how your trap can be overcome, look at your map and consider where the characters must be located to attempt an action that can foil part of the trap. As a rule, the characters should need to be near or adjacent to an element to have a chance of affecting it. An element can be designed so that it protects itself. A fighter might be able to break a whirling blade, but moving close enough to attack it requires giving the blade a chance to strike.": "作为决定如何克服陷阱的一部分，请看一下你的地图，考虑一下角色必须在什么位置才能尝试采取能挫败部分陷阱的行动。通常情况下，角色必须靠近或邻近某个元素，才有机会影响它。一个元素可以被设计成能够保护自己。一个战士也许能够打破一把旋转的刀，但要靠近它并攻击它，就需要给刀一个攻击的机会。",
	"What methods are effective against your trap? Obvious candidates are activities covered by the same sorts of checks used to defeat simple traps, but use your knowledge of the trap's design to identify other options. A valve that leaks poison gas into a room can be stopped up. A statue that emits a deadly aura can be pushed over and smashed. Attacks, spells, and special abilities can all play a role in undermining a trap.": "什么方法对你的陷阱有效？显而易见的是，用来击溃简单疏水阀的各种检查方法都会涉及到这些活动，但是利用你对疏水阀设计的了解来确定其他选择。一个向房间泄漏毒气的阀门可以被堵上。一个散发着致命光环的雕像可以被推倒并砸碎。攻击、法术和特殊能力都可以在破坏陷阱中发挥作用。",
	"Leave room for improvisation by the characters. Don't create a few predetermined solutions and wait for the players to figure out the right approach. If you understand the mechanism behind how a trap works, that makes it much easier for you to respond to the players' ideas. If a character wants to try something you haven't allowed for, pick an ability, assess the chance of success, and ask for a roll.": "为角色的即兴发挥留出空间。不要创造一些预先确定的解决方案，并等待玩家找出正确的方法。如果你了解陷阱背后的运作机制，你就会更容易对玩家的想法做出反应。如果一个角色想尝试一些你不允许的东西，那就选择一种能力，评估成功的机会，然后要求掷硬币。",
	"Shutting down one part of a complex trap usually requires multiple successes. As a default, it takes three successful checks or actions to disable an element. The first successful check might reduce the element's saving throw DC or attack bonus. The second successful check might halve the element's damage, and the final successful check shuts it down.": "关闭一个复杂陷阱的一个部分通常需要多次成功。默认情况下，需要三次成功的检查或行动才能使一个元素失效。第一次成功的检查可能会减少元素的蓄力DC或攻击奖励。第二次成功的检查可能会使元素的伤害减半，而最后一次成功的检查则是关闭它。",
	"For elements that don't attack, allow each successful check to reduce that element's effectiveness by one-third. A lock's DC is decreased, or a gate opens wide enough to allow a Small character to squeeze through it. A mechanism pumping poison gas into the room becomes defective, causing the gas's damage to increase more slowly or not at all.": "对于不攻击的元素，允许每次成功的检查使该元素的效力减少三分之一。一把锁的直流电量减少，或者一扇门开得足够大，使一个小个子的角色能够挤过去。将毒气泵入房间的装置变得有缺陷，导致毒气的伤害增加得更慢或根本没有。",
	"It takes time to disable a complex trap. Three characters can't make checks in rapid succession to disarm a complex trap in a matter of seconds. Each would get in another character's way and disrupt the effort. Once a character succeeds on a check, another character can't attempt the same check against the same trap element until the end of the successful character's next turn.": "解除一个复杂的陷阱需要时间。三个角色不可能在几秒钟内连续进行检查来解除一个复杂的陷阱。每个人都会挡住另一个角色的去路，扰乱工作。一旦一个角色检查成功，另一个角色就不能对同一个陷阱元素进行同样的检查，直到成功的角色的下一个回合结束。",
	"A complex trap is like a legendary monster in some ways. It has several tricks it can use on its turn, and it remains a threat throughout the round, not just on its turn. The trap's active elements are like a legendary creature's normal actions, and its constant elements are equivalent to legendary actions-except they are tied to specific areas in the trapped room.": "一个复杂的陷阱在某些方面就像一个传说中的怪物。它有几个技巧可以在其回合中使用，而且在整个回合中都是一个威胁，而不仅仅是在其回合中。陷阱的主动元素就像传奇生物的正常行动，而它的持续元素则相当于传奇行动--只不过它们与被困房间的特定区域相关。",
	"Although a legendary creature can move, improvise actions, and so forth, a trap is set to a specific script-an aspect that has the potential to make a complex trap stale and predictable. That's where dynamic elements come in. They keep the players on their toes and make dealing with a complex trap feel like a challenging, evolving situation.": "虽然传说中的生物可以移动，即兴行动，等等，但陷阱是按照特定的脚本设置的--这一点有可能使复杂的陷阱变得陈旧和可预测。这就是动态元素的作用。它们使玩家保持警惕，并使处理复杂的陷阱感到是一个具有挑战性的、不断发展的情况。",
	"It's possible for the characters to start a campaign at 1st level, dive into an epic story, and reach 10th level and beyond in a short amount of game time. Although that pace works fine for many campaigns, some DMs prefer a campaign story with pauses built into it—times when adventurers are not going on adventures. The downtime rules given in this section can be used as alternatives to the approach in the Player's Handbook and the Dungeon Master's Guide, or you can use the material here to inspire the creation of your own options.": "角色有可能从1级开始活动，潜入一个史诗般的故事，并在很短的游戏时间内达到10级或更高。虽然这种节奏对许多战役来说都很好，但有些DM更喜欢有停顿的战役故事--当冒险者不进行冒险的时候。本节给出的停顿时间规则可以作为《玩家手册》和《地下城管理员指南》中的方法的替代方案，或者你可以使用这里的材料来激发你创建自己的方案。",
	"By engaging the characters in downtime activities that take weeks or even months to complete, you can give your campaign a longer time line—one in which events in the world play out over years. Wars begin and end, tyrants come and go, and royal lines rise and fall over the course of the story that you and the characters tell.": "通过让人物参与需要数周甚至数月才能完成的停工活动，你可以给你的战役一个较长的时间线--世界上的事件会在数年内发展。战争开始了又结束了，暴君来了又走了，王室成员在你和人物讲述的故事过程中起起落落。",
	"Downtime rules also provide ways for characters to spend—or be relieved of—the monetary treasure they amass on their adventures.": "闲暇时间规则还为角色提供了花费或解除他们在冒险中积累的货币财富的方法。",
	"The system presented here consists of two elements. First, it introduces the concept of rivals. Second, it details a number of downtime activities that characters can undertake.": "这里提出的系统由两个要素组成。首先，它介绍了对手的概念。其次，它详细介绍了一些人物可以进行的停工活动。",
	"Rivals are NPCs who oppose the characters and make their presence felt whenever the characters are engaging in downtime. A rival might be a villain you have featured in past adventures or plan to use in the future. Rivals can also include good or neutral folk who are at odds with the characters, whether because they have opposing goals or they simply dislike one another. The cultist of Orcus whose plans the characters have foiled, the ambitious merchant prince who wants to rule the city with an iron fist, and the nosy high priest of Helm who is convinced the characters are up to no good are all examples of rivals.": "敌人是反对角色的NPC，每当角色在休息时，他们就会出现。一个对手可能是你在过去的冒险中出现过的或计划在未来使用的一个反派。竞争对手也可以包括与角色不和的好人或中立人士，无论是因为他们有相反的目标，还是仅仅因为他们彼此不喜欢对方。角色挫败了奥库斯邪教的计划，野心勃勃的商人王子想用铁拳统治城市，多管闲事的赫尔姆大祭司确信角色不怀好意，这些都是对手的例子。",
	"A rival's agenda changes over time. Though the characters engage in downtime only between adventures, their rivals rarely rest, continuing to spin plots and work against the characters even when the characters are off doing something else.": "竞争对手的议程随着时间的推移而变化。虽然人物只在冒险之间进行停顿，但他们的对手却很少休息，即使人物在做其他事情时，他们也会继续策划阴谋，与人物作对。",
	"In essence, a rival is a somewhat specialized NPC. You can use chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to build a new NPC for this purpose, or pick one from your current cast of supporting characters and embellish that NPC as described below.": "从本质上讲，对手是一个有点特殊的NPC。你可以使用《地下城管理指南》第4章来建立一个新的NPC，或者从你目前的辅助人物中挑选一个，然后按照下面的描述来美化这个NPC。",
	"It's possible for the characters to have two or three rivals at a time, each with a separate agenda. At least one should be a villain, but the others might be neutral or good; conflicts with those rivals might be social or political, rather than manifesting as direct attacks.": "人物有可能同时有两到三个对手，每个对手都有独立的议程。至少有一个是反派，但其他的可能是中立的或善良的；与这些对手的冲突可能是社会或政治的，而不是表现为直接攻击。",
	"The best rivals have a connection with their adversaries on a personal level. Find links in the characters' backstories or the events of recent adventures that explain what sparked the rival's actions. The best trouble to put the characters in is trouble they created for themselves.": "最好的对手与他们的对手在个人层面上有联系。从人物的背景故事或最近的冒险事件中找到联系，解释是什么引发了对手的行动。让人物陷入的最好的麻烦是他们为自己制造的麻烦。",
	"Tax collector who is convinced the characters are dodging fees": "确信这些人物在躲避费用的收税员",
	"Politician who is concerned that the characters are causing more trouble than they solve": "担心这些人物带来的麻烦比他们解决的问题多的政治家",
	"High priest who worries the characters are diminishing the temple's prestige": "大祭司担心这些人物会降低神庙的威信",
	"Wizard who blames the characters for some recent troubles": "将最近的一些麻烦归咎于人物的巫师",
	"Rival adventuring party": "敌对的冒险党",
	"Bard who loves a scandal enough to spark one": "喜爱丑闻而引发丑闻的巴德",
	"Childhood rival or member of a rival clan": "童年的对手或敌对部族的成员",
	"Scorned sibling or parent": "被鄙视的兄弟姐妹或父母",
	"Merchant who blames the characters for any business woes": "将任何商业困境归咎于人物的商人",
	"Newcomer out to make a mark on the world": "新来的人要在世界范围内留下痕迹",
	"Sibling or ally of defeated enemy": "被打败的敌人的兄弟姐妹或盟友",
	"Official seeking to restore a tarnished reputation": "官员寻求恢复被玷污的声誉",
	"Deadly foe disguised as a social rival": "伪装成社会对手的致命敌人",
	"Fiend seeking to tempt the characters to evil": "试图引诱人物作恶的恶魔",
	"Spurned romantic interest": "被唾弃的恋爱对象",
	"Political opportunist seeking a scapegoat": "寻找替罪羊的政治机会主义者",
	"Traitorous noble looking to foment a revolution": "想煽动革命的叛徒贵族",
	"Would-be tyrant who brooks no opposition": "不容置疑的暴君",
	"Exiled noble looking for revenge": "被流放的贵族正在寻找复仇的机会",
	"Corrupt official worried that recent misdeeds will be revealed": "腐败官员担心最近的不当行为会被揭露",
	"To add the right amount of detail to a rival you want to create, give some thought to what that NPC is trying to accomplish and what resources and methods the rival can bring to bear against the characters.": "为了给你想创建的对手增加适当的细节，要考虑一下这个NPC想要达到什么目的，以及这个对手可以用什么资源和方法来对付人物。",
	"An effective rival has a clear reason for interfering with the characters' lives. Think about what the rival wants, how and why the characters stand in the way, and how the conflict could be resolved. Ideally, a rival's goal directly involves the characters or something they care about.": "一个有效的对手有一个明确的理由来干扰人物的生活。想一想对手想要什么，人物如何以及为什么要阻挠他，以及如何解决冲突。理想的情况是，对手的目标直接涉及人物或他们所关心的事物。",
	"Think about the resources the rival can marshal. Does the character have enough money to pay bribes or to hire a small gang of mercenaries? Does the rival hold sway over any guilds, temples, or other groups? Make a list of the rival's assets, and consider how they can be used.": "想一想对手可以调动的资源。这个角色是否有足够的钱来支付贿赂或雇佣一小群雇佣兵？竞争对手是否对任何行会、寺庙或其他团体有影响力？列出对手的资产清单，并考虑如何利用它们。",
	"The foundation of a rival's presence in the campaign is the actions the rival takes or the events that occur as a result of that character's goals. Each time you resolve one or more workweeks of downtime, pick one of the ways a rival's plans might be advanced and introduce it into play.": "一个对手在战役中存在的基础是对手采取的行动或因该角色的目标而发生的事件。每次你解决了一个或多个工作周的停工期，就从对手的计划中挑选一种可能被推进的方式，将其引入游戏。",
	"Think about how a rival might operate in order to bring specific plans to fruition, and jot down three or four kinds of actions the rival might undertake. Some of these might be versions of the downtime activities described later in this section, but these are more often efforts that are specific to the rival.": "想一想对手可能如何运作以实现具体的计划，并记下对手可能采取的三或四种行动。其中一些可能是本节后面描述的停工活动的版本，但这些往往是对手的具体努力。",
	"A rival's action might be a direct attack, such as an assassination attempt, that you play out during a session. Or it might be a background activity that you describe as altering the campaign in some way. For example, a rival who wants to increase the prestige of the temple of a war god might hold a festival with drink, food, and gladiatorial games. Even if the characters aren't directly involved, the event becomes the talk of the town.": "竞争对手的行动可能是一个直接的攻击，例如暗杀企图，你在会议期间进行。它也可能是一个背景活动，你把它描述为以某种方式改变战役。例如，一个想要提高战神庙宇威望的对手可能会举办一个有饮料、食物和角斗士游戏的节日。即使人物没有直接参与，这个活动也会成为全镇的话题。",
	"Some elements of a rival's plans might involve events in the world that aren't under the rival's control. Whether such an event can be easily anticipated or not, the rival's plans might include contingencies for taking advantage of such happenings.": "竞争对手计划中的一些内容可能涉及到世界上不在竞争对手控制之下的事件。无论这样的事件是否可以轻易预见，对手的计划可能包括利用这种事件的应急措施。",
	"Downtime activities are tasks that usually take a workweek (5 days) or longer to perform. These tasks can include buying or creating magic items, pulling off crimes, and working at a job. A character selects a downtime activity from among those available and pays the cost of that activity in time and money. You, as DM, then follow the rules for the activity to resolve it, informing the player of the results and any complications that ensue.": "闲暇活动是指通常需要一个工作周（5天）或更长时间才能完成的任务。这些任务可以包括购买或创造魔法物品，实施犯罪，以及工作。一个角色从现有的活动中选择一个停工活动，并支付该活动的时间和金钱成本。你，作为管理人，然后按照该活动的规则来解决它，将结果和随之而来的任何复杂情况通知玩家。",
	"Consider handling downtime away from the game table. For example, you could have the players pick their downtime activities at the end of a session, and then communicate about them by email or text, until you next see them in person.": "考虑在远离游戏桌的地方处理停工时间。例如，你可以让玩家在会议结束时选择他们的休息时间活动，然后通过电子邮件或文本进行沟通，直到你下次见到他们本人。",
	"The description of each activity tells you how to resolve it. Many activities require an ability check, so be sure to note the character's relevant ability modifiers. Follow the steps in the activity, and determine the results.": "每项活动的描述告诉你如何解决它。许多活动需要进行能力检查，所以一定要注意角色的相关能力修正值。按照活动的步骤进行，并确定结果。",
	"Most downtime activities require a workweek (5 days) to complete. Some activities require days, weeks (7 days), or months (30 days). A character must spend at least 8 hours of each day engaged in the downtime activity for that day to count toward the activity's completion.": "大多数停机活动需要一个工作周（5天）来完成。有些活动需要几天，几周（7天），或几个月（30天）。一个角色每天必须花至少8个小时从事停工活动，才能算作活动的完成。",
	"The days of an activity don't need to be consecutive; you can spread them over a longer period of time than is required for the activity. But that period of time should be no more than twice as long as the required time; otherwise you should introduce extra complications (see below) and possibly double the activity's costs to represent the inefficiency of the character's progress.": "一项活动的天数不需要连续，你可以把它们分散在比活动所需时间更长的时间段内。但这段时间不应超过所需时间的两倍；否则你应该引入额外的复杂因素（见下文），并可能使活动的费用翻倍，以代表角色进展的低效率。",
	"The description of each activity includes a discussion of complications you can throw at the characters. The consequences of a complication might spawn entire adventures, introduce NPCs to vex the party, or give the characters headaches or advantages in any number of other ways.": "每项活动的描述都包括对你可以向角色抛出的复杂情况的讨论。复杂情况的后果可能会引发整个冒险，引入NPC来困扰当事人，或者以任何其他方式让角色感到头痛或有利。",
	"Each of these sections has a table that offers possible complications. You can roll to determine a complication randomly, pick one from the table, or devise one of your own, and then share it with the player.": "每个部分都有一个表格，提供可能的复杂情况。你可以通过掷骰子来随机决定一个复杂情况，从表中挑选一个，或者自己设计一个，然后与玩家分享。",
	"The following activities are suitable for any character who can afford to pursue them. As DM, you have the final say on which activities are available to the characters. The activities you allow might depend on the nature of the area where the characters are located. For example, you might disallow the creation of magic items or decide that the characters are in a town that is too isolated from major markets for them to buy such items.": "以下活动适合于任何有能力从事这些活动的角色。作为DM，你对角色可以参加哪些活动有最终决定权。你所允许的活动可能取决于角色所在地区的性质。例如，你可能不允许创造魔法物品，或者决定人物所在的城镇与主要市场过于隔绝，使他们无法购买此类物品。",
	"Purchasing a magic item requires time and money to seek out and contact people willing to sell items. Even then, there is no guarantee a seller will have the items a character desires.": "购买魔法物品需要时间和金钱来寻找和联系愿意出售物品的人。即使如此，也不能保证卖家会有一个角色想要的物品。",
	"Finding magic items to purchase requires at least one workweek of effort and 100 gp in expenses. Spending more time and money increases your chance of finding a high-quality item.": "寻找购买魔法物品需要至少一个工作周的努力和100金币的支出。花费更多的时间和金钱可以增加你找到高质量物品的机会。",
	"As shown on the Buying Magic Items table, the total of the check dictates which table in the Dungeon Master's Guide to roll on to determine which items are on the market. Or you can roll for items from any table associated with a lower total on the Buying Magic Items table. As a further option to reflect the availability of items in your campaign, you can apply a -10 penalty for low magic campaigns or a +10 bonus for high magic campaigns. Furthermore, you can double magic item costs in low magic campaigns.": "如购买魔法物品表所示，检查的总数决定了在《地下城主指南》中的哪张表上滚动来确定哪些物品在市场上。你也可以从任何一个与购买魔法物品表上较低的总数相关的表中滚动购买物品。作为反映你的战役中物品可用性的进一步选择，你可以对低魔法战役进行-10的惩罚，或对高魔法战役进行+10的奖励。此外，你可以在低魔力活动中把魔法物品的成本翻倍。",
	"Using the Magic Item Price table, you then assign prices to the available items, based on their rarity. Halve the price of any consumable item, such as a potion or a scroll, when using the table to determine an asking price.": "使用魔法物品价格表，你就可以根据物品的稀有程度为可用物品定价。在使用该表确定要价时，将任何消耗品的价格减半，如药水或卷轴。",
	"You have final say in determining which items are for sale and their final price, no matter what the tables say.": "你有最终决定权，决定哪些物品是要出售的，以及它们的最终价格，不管桌子上怎么说。",
	"If the characters seek a specific magic item, first decide if it's an item you want to allow in your game. If so, include the desired item among the items for sale on a check total of 10 or higher if the item is common, 15 or higher if it is uncommon, 20 or higher if it is rare, 25 or higher if it is very rare, and 30 or higher if it is legendary.": "如果角色要寻找一个特定的魔法物品，首先要决定这是否是你想在游戏中允许的物品。如果是的话，在出售的物品中包括所需的物品，如果该物品是常见的，则检查总数为10或更高，如果是不常见的，则为15或更高，如果是稀有的，则为20或更高，如果是非常稀有的，则为25或更高，如果是传奇的，则为30或更高。",

	"Contacts are NPCs who now share a bond with the character. Each one either owes the character a favor or has some reason to bear a grudge. A hostile contact works against the character, placing obstacles but stopping short of committing a crime or a violent act. Allied contacts are friends who will render aid to the character, but not at the risk of their lives.": "联系人是现在与该角色有联系的NPC。每个人要么欠角色一个人情，要么有一些理由去记恨。敌对的联系人会与角色作对，为其设置障碍，但不会实施犯罪或暴力行动。同盟的联系人是会向角色提供援助的朋友，但不会冒着生命危险。",

	"Once a contact has helped or hindered a character, the character needs to carouse again to get back into the NPC's good graces. A contact provides help once, not help for life.

	"You can assign specific NPCs as contacts. You might decide that the barkeep at the Wretched Gorgon and a guard stationed at the western gate are the character's allied contacts. Assigning specific NPCs gives the players concrete options. It brings the campaign to life and seeds the area with NPCs that the characters care about. On the other hand, it can prove difficult to track and might render a contact useless if that character doesn't come into play.": "你可以指定特定的NPC作为联系人。你可以决定让Wretched Gorgon的酒吧老板和驻扎在西门的一个警卫成为角色的盟友联系人。指定特定的NPC为玩家提供具体的选择。它为战役带来了活力，并在该地区播下了角色关心的NPC的种子。另一方面，它可能会被证明是难以追踪的，而且如果该角色不出现，可能会使联系人失去作用。",
	"Alternatively, you can allow the player to make an NPC into a contact on the spot, after carousing. When the characters are in the area in which they caroused, a player can expend an allied contact and designate an NPC they meet as a contact, assuming the NPC is of the correct social class based on how the character caroused. The player should provide a reasonable explanation for this relationship and work it into the game.": "另外，你也可以让玩家在狂欢之后，当场让一个NPC成为联系人。当角色在他们狂欢的地区时，玩家可以消耗一个盟友联系人，并指定他们遇到的一个NPC为联系人，假设这个NPC根据角色的狂欢方式属于正确的社会等级。玩家应该为这种关系提供一个合理的解释，并将其纳入游戏中。",
	"Using a mix of the two approaches is a good idea, since it gives you the added depth of specific contacts while giving players the freedom to ensure that the contacts they accumulate are useful.": "混合使用这两种方法是一个好主意，因为它给你增加了特定联系人的深度，同时给玩家自由，以确保他们积累的联系人是有用的。",
	"The same process can apply to hostile contacts. You can give the characters a specific NPC they should avoid, or you might introduce one at an inopportune or dramatic moment.": "同样的过程可以适用于敌对的接触。你可以给角色一个他们应该避免的特定NPC，或者你可以在一个不恰当的或戏剧性的时刻引入一个NPC。",
	"At any time, a character can have a maximum number of unspecified allied contacts equal to 1 + the character's Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

	"Magic items are prized by D&D adventurers of all sorts and are often the main reward in an adventure. The rules for magic items are presented, along with the Treasure Hoard tables, in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

The section ends with tables that group magic items according to rarity.": "魔法物品是D&D的各种冒险者所珍视的，而且往往是冒险中的主要奖励。魔法物品的规则和藏宝表在《地下城管理员指南》的第7章中有所介绍。本节对这些规则进行了扩展，为你提供了另一种方法来决定哪些魔法物品最终会落入角色手中，并为游戏增加了一个常见魔法物品的集合。本节最后附有根据稀有程度对魔法物品进行分组的表格。",
	"The system in the dungeon master's guide is designed so that you can generate all treasure randomly, and the tables also govern the number of magic items the characters receive. In short, the tables do the work. But a DM who's designing or modifying an adventure might prefer to choose the magic items that come into play.

	"This alternative method of treasure determination focuses on choosing magic items based on their rarity, rather than by rolling on the tables in the dungeon master's guide. This method uses two tables: Magic Items Awarded by Tier and Magic Items Awarded by Rarity.": "这种确定宝物的替代方法侧重于根据其稀有性选择魔法物品，而不是通过在地下城主指南中的表格上滚动。这种方法使用两个表格。按等级授予的魔法物品和按稀有度授予的魔法物品。",
	"Total": "共计",
	"The Magic Items Awarded by Tier table shows the number of magic items a D&D party typically gains during a campaign, culminating in the group's having accumulated one hundred magic items by 20th level. The table shows how many of those items are meant to be handed out during each of the four tiers of play. The emphasis on characters receiving more items during the second tier (levels 5-10) than in other tiers is by design. The second tier is where much of the play occurs in a typical D&D campaign, and the items gained in that tier prepare the characters for higher-level adventures.": "按层级授予的魔法物品表显示了一个D&D团队在活动期间通常获得的魔法物品数量，最终该团队在20级之前积累了100个魔法物品。该表显示了在四个等级的游戏中，每个等级要发放多少物品。强调角色在第二层（5-10级）比其他层获得更多的物品是设计的。在典型的D&D活动中，第二层是大部分游戏发生的地方，在该层获得的物品为角色进行更高级别的冒险做好了准备。",
	"The Magic Items Awarded by Rarity table takes the numbers from the Magic Items Awarded by Tier table and breaks them down to show the number of items of each rarity the characters are expected to have when they reach the end of a tier.": "按稀有度授予的魔法物品表从按等级授予的魔法物品表中提取数字，并将其细分，以显示角色在达到一个等级的终点时预计拥有的每种稀有度的物品数量。",
	"Both tables in this section make a distinction between minor magic items and major magic items. This distinction exists in the Dungeon Master's Guide, yet those terms aren't used there. In that book, the minor items are those listed on Magic Item Tables A through E, and the major items are on Magic Item Tables F through I. As you can see from the Treasure Hoard tables in that book, major magic items are meant to be handed out much less frequently than minor items, even at higher levels of play.": "本节中的两个表格都对小魔法物品和大魔法物品进行了区分。这种区别存在于《地下城管理员指南》中，但那里并没有使用这些术语。在该书中，次要物品是指魔法物品表A至E中所列的物品，主要物品是指魔法物品表F至I中所列的物品。正如你从该书中的宝藏囤积表所看到的，主要魔法物品的发放频率远远低于次要物品，即使是在较高的游戏级别。",
	"The dungeon master's guide assumes a certain amount of treasure will be found over the course of a campaign. Over twenty levels of typical play, the game expects forty-five rolls on the Treasure Hoard tables, distributed as follows:": "地牢主人指南假定在一个活动过程中会发现一定数量的财宝。在二十个典型的游戏关卡中，游戏预计会在藏宝表上进行四十五次滚动，分布如下。",

	"Eight rolls on the Challenge 17+ table": "挑战17+表上的八次滚动",
	"Because many of the table results call for more than one magic item, those forty-five rolls will result in the characters obtaining roughly one hundred items. The optional system described here yields the same number of items, distributed properly throughout the spectrum of rarity, while enabling you to control exactly which items the characters have a chance of acquiring.": "由于表格中的许多结果都需要一个以上的魔法物品，这四十五次滚动将导致角色获得大约一百个物品。这里描述的可选系统产生了相同数量的物品，在整个稀有度范围内适当分布，同时使你能够准确控制人物有机会获得哪些物品。",

	"2. Refer to the line in the Level/CR column that corresponds to one of the following values (your choice): the level of the player characters, the challenge rating of the magic item's owner, or the challenge rating of the group of creatures guarding the item. The entries in that row of the table indicate the total number of items that would be appropriate for the characters to receive by the end of the tier represented by that row.": "2. 请参考等级/CR栏中与下列数值之一相对应的一行（你自己选择）：玩家角色的等级、魔法物品主人的挑战等级，或守护物品的生物群的挑战等级。表中该行的条目表示到该行所代表的等级结束时，适合人物获得的物品的总数。",

	"In the future, if you choose an item of a rarity that's not available in the current tier but is still available in a lower tier, deduct the item from the lower tier. If all lower tiers also have no items available of a given rarity, deduct the item from a higher tier.": "在未来，如果你选择的物品的稀有度在当前层级中没有，但在较低层级中仍有，则从较低层级中扣除该物品。如果所有较低层级也没有特定稀有度的物品，则从较高层级扣除该物品。",
	"If you prefer a more free-form method of choosing magic items, simply select each magic item you want to give out; then, when the characters acquire one, deduct it from the Magic Items Awarded by Rarity table in your notes. Whenever you do so, start with the lowest tier, and deduct the item from the first number you come across in the appropriate rarity column for the item, whether its minor or major. If that tier doesn't have a number greater than 0 for that rarity, go up a tier until you find one that does, and deduct the magic item from that number. Following this process, you will zero out each row of the table in order, going from the lowest levels to the highest.": "如果你喜欢用一种更自由的方法来选择魔法物品，只需选择你想送出的每一件魔法物品；然后，当人物获得一件魔法物品时，从你笔记中的按稀有度授予的魔法物品表中扣除。每当你这样做时，就从最低的层级开始，从你遇到的该物品的相应稀有度栏中的第一个数字中扣除该物品，不管它是小的还是大的。如果该层级的稀有度没有大于0的数字，就往上走，直到你找到一个有的数字，然后从这个数字中扣除魔法物品。按照这个过程，你将按顺序将表格的每一行清零，从最低级别到最高级别。",
	"The magic item tables in this section are based on the number of items the characters are expected to receive, not the number of items that are available in an adventure. When creating or modifying an adventure, assume that the characters won't find all the items you place in it, unless most of the loot is in easy-to-find locations. Here's a good rule of thumb: an adventure can include a number of items that's 25 percent higher than the numbers in the tables (round up). For example, an adventure designed to take characters from 1st to 4th level might include fourteen items rather than eleven, in the expectation that three of those items won't be found.": "本节中的魔法物品表是基于角色预计会得到的物品数量，而不是冒险中可得到的物品数量。当创建或修改一个冒险时，要假定角色不会找到你放在里面的所有物品，除非大部分战利品都在容易找到的地方。这里有一个很好的经验法则：一个冒险可以包括的物品数量比表格中的数字高25%（四舍五入）。例如，一个旨在让角色从第一级到第四级的冒险可以包括14件物品，而不是11件，因为预计其中有三件物品不会被发现。",
	"The D&D game is built on the assumption that magic items appear sporadically and that they are always a boon, unless an item bears a curse. Characters and monsters are built to face each other without the help of magic items, which means that having a magic item always makes a character more powerful or versatile than a generic character of the same level. As DM, you never have to worry about awarding magic items just so the characters can keep up with the campaign's threats. Magic items are truly prizes. Are they useful? Absolutely. Are they necessary? No.": "D&D游戏建立在这样的假设上：魔法物品是零星出现的，它们总是一种恩惠，除非某个物品带有诅咒。角色和怪物都是在没有魔法物品帮助的情况下建立起来的，这意味着拥有魔法物品总是能使一个角色比同等级的普通角色更强大或更全面。作为DM，你永远不必担心为了让角色能够跟上战役的威胁而授予魔法物品。魔法物品是真正的奖赏。它们有用吗？当然有用。它们是必要的吗？不是。",
	"Magic items can go from nice to necessary in the rare group that has no spellcasters, no monk, and no NPCs capable of casting magic weapon. Having no magic makes it extremely difficult for a party to overcome monsters that have resistances or immunity to nonmagical damage. In such a game, you'll want to be generous with magic weapons or else avoid using such monsters.": "在没有施法者、没有僧侣、没有能够施放魔法武器的NPC的罕见团体中，魔法物品可以从好的变成必要的。没有魔法使得一个团队很难战胜那些对非魔法伤害有抵抗力或免疫力的怪物。在这样的游戏中，你要慷慨地使用魔法武器，否则就要避免使用这种怪物。",
	"The dungeon master's guide includes many magic items of every rarity. The one exception are common items; that book includes few of them. This section introduces more of them to the game. These items seldom increase a character's power, but they are likely to amuse players and provide fun roleplaying opportunities.": "地下城主指南包括许多各种稀有度的魔法物品。唯一的例外是普通物品；那本书中的普通物品很少。本节将向游戏介绍更多此类物品。这些物品很少会增加角色的力量，但它们很可能会逗乐玩家，并提供有趣的角色扮演机会。",
	"The magic items are presented in alphabetical order.": "这些魔法物品是按字母顺序排列的。",
	"Some magic items can be used a limited number of times but are recharged by the arrival of dawn. What if you're on a plane of existence that lacks anything resembling dawn? The DM should choose a time every 24 hours when such magic items recharge on that plane of existence.": "有些魔法物品可以使用的次数有限，但在黎明到来时可以重新充电。如果你所在的存在平面缺乏类似于黎明的东西，怎么办？DM应该每24小时选择一个时间，让这些魔法物品在该存在平面上充能。",
	"Even on a world that experiences dawn each day, the DM is free to choose a different time-perhaps noon, sunset, or midnight-when certain magic items recharge.": "即使在一个每天都经历黎明的世界里，DM也可以自由地选择不同的时间，也许是中午、日落或午夜，让某些魔法物品充能。",
	"Many of the character classes in the player's handbook harness magic in the form of spells. This chapter provides new spells for those classes, as well as for spellcasting monsters. The Dungeon Master decides which of these spells are available in a campaign and how they can be learned. For example, a DM might decide that some of the spells are freely available, that others are unobtainable, and that a handful can be found only after a special quest, perhaps discovered in a long-lost tome of magic. Wizard spells, in particular, can be introduced to a campaign in spellbooks found as treasure.": "玩家手册中的许多角色类别都以法术的形式驾驭着魔法。本章为这些等级提供了新的法术，也为施法的怪物提供了新的法术。地牢管理员决定这些法术中哪些可以在战役中使用，以及如何学习它们。例如，管理员可能会决定有些法术是免费提供的，有些则是无法获得的，还有一些法术只有在进行特殊的探索之后才能找到，也许是在一本失传已久的魔法书中发现的。尤其是巫师的法术，可以通过作为宝物发现的法术书引入到活动中。",
	"When a DM adds spells to a campaign, clerics, druids, and paladins require special consideration. When characters of those classes prepare their spells, they have access to the entire spell list for their class. Given that fact, the DM should be cautious about making all of these new spells available to a player who is overwhelmed when presented with many options. For such a player, consider adding only story-appropriate spells to the spell list of that player's character.": "当DM在活动中加入法术时，牧师、德鲁伊和圣骑士需要特别考虑。当这些等级的角色准备他们的法术时，他们可以使用他们等级的全部法术列表。鉴于这一事实，对于将所有这些新法术提供给一个在面对众多选择时不知所措的玩家，DM应该谨慎行事。对于这样的玩家，可以考虑只在该玩家的角色的法术列表中添加与故事相适应的法术。",

	"In a shared campaign, more than one member of the group can take on the role of DM. A shared campaign is episodic rather than continuous, with each play session comprising a complete adventure.": "在共享战役中，小组中的一个以上的成员可以承担DM的角色。共享战役是情节性的，而不是连续性的，每个游戏环节包括一个完整的冒险。",
	"The largest shared campaigns are administered by the D&D Adventurers League and overseen by Wizards of the Coast.

	"A shared campaign establishes a framework that allows a player to take a character from one DM's game to another one within the shared campaign. It creates a situation where almost nothing can prevent a scheduled session from happening. The roster of potential players can be quite large, virtually ensuring that any session has at least the minimum number of characters needed to play. If everyone shows up to play at the same time, multiple DMs ensure that everyone can take part.": "共享活动建立了一个框架，允许玩家在共享活动中把一个角色从一个DM的游戏带到另一个游戏中。它创造了一种情况，几乎没有什么可以阻止预定的会议发生。潜在玩家的名册可以相当大，几乎可以确保任何会议都至少有游戏所需的最低数量的角色。如果每个人都在同一时间出现在游戏中，多个DM就能确保每个人都能参加。",

If you're interested in learning more about how to run a shared campaign and seeing how the Adventurers League handles certain issues, then the rest of this appendix is meant for you.": "为了获得成功，共享运动需要一个冠军--一个承担组织和维护团体的责任的人。如果你有兴趣了解更多关于如何开展共享活动的信息，并看看冒险家联盟是如何处理某些问题的，那么本附录的其余部分就是为你准备的。",
	"Time and time again, the core rulebooks come back to the point that the most important goal of a D&D play session is for everyone involved to have fun. In keeping with that goal, it's a good idea for a shared campaign to have a code of conduct. Because people who don't normally play together might end up at the same table in a shared campaign, it can be helpful to establish some ground rules for behavior.": "核心规则书中一次又一次地提到，D&D游戏环节最重要的目标是让每个人都能获得乐趣。为了与这个目标保持一致，共享活动有一个行为准则是个好主意。因为通常不在一起玩的人可能会在共享活动中出现在同一张桌子上，所以制定一些基本的行为规则可能会有帮助。",
	"On the broadest level, everyone in a shared campaign is responsible for making sure that everyone else has an enjoyable time. If anyone feels offended, belittled, or bullied by the actions of another person, the entire purpose of getting together to play is defeated.": "在最广泛的层面上，共享运动中的每个人都有责任确保其他人有一个愉快的时间。如果有人感到被冒犯，被轻视，或被另一个人的行为所欺负，那么聚集在一起玩的整个目的就被打败了。",
	"The basic code of conduct for a shared campaign might be modeled on a similar document that another organization or location uses. Beyond that, some special policies might need to be added to account for what might happen at the table when players and DMs interact. As a starting point, consider the following material, which is excerpted from the Adventurers League code of conduct.": "共享活动的基本行为准则可能是以另一个组织或地点使用的类似文件为蓝本。除此之外，可能还需要增加一些特殊的政策，以考虑到当玩家和管理人互动时在桌子上可能发生的事情。作为一个起点，考虑以下材料，它摘自冒险者联盟的行为准则。",
	"During a play session, participants are expected to:": "在游戏过程中，参与者要做到以下几点。",
	"Follow the DM's lead and refrain from arguing with the DM or other players over rules.": "听从管理员的领导，不要与管理员或其他玩家争论规则。",
	"Let other players speak, and allow other players to get attention from the DM.": "让其他玩家发言，并允许其他玩家得到DM的关注。",
	"Avoid excessive conversation that is not relevant to the adventure.": "避免与冒险无关的过多谈话。",
	"Discourage others from using social media to bully, shame, or intimidate other participants.": "劝阻他人使用社交媒体来欺负、羞辱或恐吓其他参与者。",
	"Make the DM or the campaign's administrators aware of disruptive or aggressive behavior so that appropriate action can be taken.": "让DM或活动的管理员了解破坏性或攻击性的行为，以便采取适当的行动。",
	"Designing adventures for a shared campaign involves a different set of considerations than designing for a standard group of players. Most important, the adventure must be timed to conclude when the session is scheduled to end. You also need to balance combat encounters for a range of levels, since a wide range of characters might be experiencing the adventure at the same time.": "为一个共享的活动设计冒险，与为一群标准的玩家设计不同，需要考虑一系列的问题。最重要的是，冒险的时间必须安排在会话结束时结束。你还需要平衡不同等级的战斗遭遇，因为有很多角色可能会同时经历这个冒险。",
	"Every adventure in a shared campaign begins and ends in the same play session. (If a group of participants wants to take longer to finish and all are willing to do so, they can exceed the time limit.) A session or an event can't end with the adventure unfinished, since there's no way to guarantee that the same players and DM will be available for the next session.": "共享活动中的每一次冒险都在同一个游戏环节中开始和结束。(如果一组参与者想花更多的时间来完成，并且所有人都愿意这样做，他们可以超过时间限制）。一个会话或一个活动不能在冒险未完成的情况下结束，因为没有办法保证下一个会话有同样的玩家和管理员。",
	"Typically, adventures in a shared campaign are designed to take either 2 hours or 4 hours. In each hour of play, assume the characters can complete the following:": "通常情况下，共享活动中的冒险被设计为需要2小时或4小时。在每一小时的游戏中，假设角色可以完成以下内容。",
	"Three or four simple combat encounters, or one or two complex ones": "三或四次简单的战斗遭遇，或一或两次复杂的遭遇",
	"Three or four scenes involving significant exploration or social interaction": "三或四场涉及重大探索或社会互动的场景",
	"Within these constraints, it can be difficult to create open-ended adventures. A time limit assumes a specific starting point and endpoint. A good way to get around this restriction is to create an adventure with multiple possible endings.": "在这些限制下，可能很难创造出开放式的冒险。时间限制假定了一个特定的起点和终点。绕过这个限制的一个好办法是创造一个有多种可能结局的冒险。",
	"Location-based adventures also work well with this format. A dungeon presents a natural limit on character options, while still giving the players choices. The adventure could be a quest to defeat a creature or recover an item, but the path to achieving that goal can be different for each group.": "基于地点的冒险也很适合这种形式。地牢对角色的选择提出了一个自然的限制，同时仍然给玩家以选择。冒险可以是一个击败生物或恢复物品的任务，但实现这一目标的路径对每个小组来说都可以是不同的。",
	"For more narrative adventures, try to focus on simple but flexible encounters or events. For instance, an adventure requires the characters to protect a high priest of Tyr from assassins. Give the players a chance to plan out how they want to protect the temple, complete with authority over the guards. A few well-fleshed out NPCs, some of whom might be suspected of working with the temple's enemies, add a layer of tension. Consider leaving some details or plot points for the DM to decide. For example, the DM might have the option to pick which member of the temple guards is the traitor, ensuring that the scenario is different for each group.": "对于更多的叙事性冒险，试着把重点放在简单但灵活的遭遇或事件上。例如，一个冒险要求角色保护泰尔的一个大祭司不受刺杀。给玩家一个机会，让他们计划如何保护神庙，并对守卫有完整的权力。几位内容丰富的NPC，其中一些可能被怀疑与神庙的敌人合作，会增加一层紧张感。考虑将一些细节或情节点留给DM来决定。例如，DM可以选择神庙守卫中的哪位成员是叛徒，以确保每个小组的情景都不同。",
	"Design your adventure for one of the four tiers, as set forth in chapter 1 of the player's handbook: tier 1 includes levels 1-4, tier 2 is levels 5-10, tier 3 is levels 11-16, and tier 4 includes levels 17-20. Within each tier, it's a good idea to use a specific level as a starting point. Assume a party of five 3rd-level characters for tier 1, five 8th-level characters for tier 2, five 13th-level characters for tier 3, and five 18th-level characters for tier 4. Use that assumption when creating combat encounters, whether you use the encounter-building rules in the dungeon master's guide or are making an estimate.": "按照玩家手册第一章的规定，为四个等级之一设计你的冒险：第一级包括1-4级，第二级是5-10级，第三级是11-16级，第四级包括17-20级。在每个等级中，用一个特定的等级作为起点是个好主意。假设第1层有5个3级人物，第2层有5个8级人物，第3层有5个13级人物，第4层有5个18级人物。在创建战斗奇遇时，无论你是使用地下城主指南中的奇遇构建规则还是进行估计，都要使用这一假设。",
	"For each battle, provide guidelines to help DMs adjust the difficulty up or down to match stronger or weaker parties. As a rule of thumb, account for a party two levels higher and for a party two levels lower, and don't worry about balancing the adventure for parties outside the adventure's tier.": "对于每场战斗，提供指导原则，以帮助管理员提高或降低难度，以匹配更强或更弱的队伍。作为一个经验法则，要考虑到高两级的队伍和低两级的队伍，而不要担心为冒险等级以外的队伍平衡冒险的问题。",
	"Adventures in a shared campaign that uses variant rules for gaining levels and acquiring treasure (such as those described below) don't include experience point awards or specific amounts and kinds of treasure.": "在共享活动中，使用获得等级和获得宝物的变体规则的冒险（如下面所述）不包括经验值奖励或特定数量和种类的宝物。",
	"A shared campaign's guidelines for character creation might include definition of which races and classes players can choose from, how players generate ability scores, and which alignments players can choose.": "一个共享活动的角色创建指南可能包括定义玩家可以选择哪些种族和等级，玩家如何产生能力分数，以及玩家可以选择哪些结盟。",
	"You should think about which products players can use to create a character. The Adventurers League specifies that a player can use the player's handbook and one other official D&D source, such as a book or a PDF, to create a character. This restriction ensures that players don't need to own a lot of books to make a character and makes it easier for DMs to know how all the characters in the campaign work. Since a DM in a shared campaign must deal with a broad range of characters, rather than the same characters each week, it can be difficult to track all the interactions and abilities possible through mixing options freely. We strongly recommend this rule for any shared campaign.": "你应该考虑一下玩家可以使用哪些产品来创建角色。冒险者联盟规定，玩家可以使用玩家手册和其他一个官方的D&D资料，如书或PDF，来创建一个角色。这一限制确保了玩家不需要拥有大量书籍来创建角色，并使DM更容易知道活动中的所有角色如何运作。由于共享战役中的DM必须处理广泛的角色，而不是每周处理相同的角色，因此很难通过自由混合选项追踪所有可能的互动和能力。我们强烈建议任何共享活动采用这一规则。",
	"For generating ability scores, we recommend allowing players to choose between the standard array-15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8-and the option presented in \"Variant: Customizing Ability Scores\" in chapter 1 of the player's handbook.": "对于生成能力分数，我们建议让玩家在标准阵列-15、14、13、12、10、8之间进行选择，以及在玩家手册第1章的 \"变体。自定义能力分数 \"中提出的选项，该选项位于玩家手册的第一章。",
	"For the sake of simplicity and efficiency, it's a good idea to require that beginning characters must take the starting equipment specified by a character's class and background.": "为了简单和高效起见，要求开始时的角色必须采取角色的等级和背景所规定的起始装备是一个好主意。",
	"A shared campaign might use some variant rules to handle certain aspects of the game. The Adventurers League, for instance, has variant systems for gaining levels and acquiring treasure. These \"house rules,\" presented below, serve as a sort of common language, ensuring that the rewards all characters receive are equivalent no matter what kind of adventure a character experienced.": "一个共享活动可能会使用一些变体规则来处理游戏的某些方面。例如，冒险者联盟就有获得等级和获得宝藏的变体系统。下面介绍的这些 \"内部规则 \"可以作为一种共同语言，确保所有角色获得的奖励都是同等的，无论角色经历了什么样的冒险。",
	"See the {@variantrule Shared Campaign Variant Rules|XGE|variant rules} entry for more information.": "更多信息见{@variantrule Shared Campaign Variant Rules|XGE|variant rules}条目。",
	"Some players and DMs have a knack for coming up with  character names on the fly, while others find that task  more of a challenge. The tables in this appendix are  designed to make life easier for both kinds of people,  whether you're naming a player character, a nonplayer  character, a monster, or even a place.": "有些玩家和管理人有随心所欲地想出角色名称的诀窍，而另一些人则发现这项任务更具有挑战性。本附录中的表格旨在为这两种人提供便利，无论你是为玩家角色、非玩家角色、怪物，甚至是一个地方命名。",
	"Each table contains names that are associated with  a nonhuman character race in the player's handbook or a real-world ethnic or language group, with a focus  on groups from antiquity and the Middle Ages. You can select from the possibilities here, or use dice to determine a name.": "每个表格都包含了与玩家手册中的非人类角色种族或现实世界中的民族或语言群体有关的名字，重点是古代和中世纪的群体。你可以从这里的可能性中选择，或者用骰子来决定一个名字。",
	"Even though names are associated with races in this  appendix, a character might not have a name from their  own race. For instance, a half-orc might have grown up  among dwarves and have a dwarven name. Or, as DM,  you might decide that dragonborn in your campaign  have a culture reminiscent of ancient Rome and therefore use Roman names, rather than the dragonborn  names suggested here.": "尽管本附录中的名字与种族相关，但一个角色可能没有自己种族的名字。例如，一个半兽人可能是在矮人中长大的，所以有一个矮人的名字。或者，作为管理员，你可能会决定在你的战役中龙族有一种让人联想到古罗马的文化，因此使用罗马的名字，而不是这里建议的龙族名字。",
	"See the {@5etools names|names.html} page for the full collection of name tables.": "参见{@5etools names|names.html}页面，了解名称表的完整集合。",
	"A character with the noble background can mingle with the upper class, but other characters can do so only if you judge that the character has made sufficient contacts. Alternatively, a character might use a {@item disguise kit|phb} and the {@skill Deception} skill to pass as a noble visiting from a distant city.": "一个有贵族背景的角色可以和上层阶级打成一片，但其他角色只有在你判断该角色已经有足够的关系时才能这样做。或者，一个角色可以使用{@item disguise kit|phb}和{@skill Deception}的技能来冒充从远方城市来的贵族。",
	"{@note The items in the {@5etools Items|items.html} page are classified as major or minor according to tables originally found in this section.}": "{@note The items in the {@5etools Items|items.html}的页面根据本节最初的表格划分为主要或次要类别。｝",

	"This book relies on the rules in the three core rulebooks. The game especially makes frequent use of the rules in chapters 7-10 of the player's handbook: \"Using Ability Scores,\" \"Adventuring,\" \"Combat,\" and \"Spellcasting.\" That book's appendix A is also crucial; it contains definitions of conditions, like {@condition invisible} and {@condition prone}. You don't need to know the rules by heart, but it's helpful to know where to find them when you need them.": "这本书依赖于三本核心规则书中的规则。游戏特别经常使用玩家手册第7-10章的规则：\"使用能力分数\"，\"冒险\"，\"战斗\"和\"施法\"。该书的附录A也至关重要；其中包含了条件的定义，比如{@condition invisible}和{@condition prone}。你不需要死记规则，但当需要时知道在哪里找到它们会很有帮助。",
	"You were ensorcelled by a fey and enslaved for {@dice 1d6} years before you escaped.": "你被一位仙灵施下魔法，被奴役了{@dice 1d6}年才成功逃脱。",
	"A devil tempted you. Make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, your alignment shifts one step toward evil (if it's not evil already), and you start the game with an additional {@dice 1d20+50} gp.": "一个恶魔诱惑了你。进行一次DC 10的感知豁免检定。如果未通过检定，你的属性方向向邪恶方向移动一步（如果尚未是邪恶的），并且你在游戏开始时额外获得{@dice 1d20+50} gp。",
	"A romantic relationship ended. Roll a {@dice d6}. An odd number means it ended with bad feelings, while an even number means it ended amicably.": "一段浪漫的关系结束了。掷骰子{@dice d6}。如果是奇数，意味着以不愉快的感觉结束，如果是偶数，意味着和平结束。",
	"A current or prospective romantic partner of yours died. Roll on the Cause of Death supplemental table to find out how. If the result is murder, roll a {@dice d12}. On a 1, you were responsible, whether directly or indirectly.": "你的一位现任或潜在的浪漫伴侣去世了。在死因补充表上投掷骰子，以找出原因。如果结果是谋杀，投掷{@dice d12}。如果投掷到1，那么无论是直接还是间接的，你都是罪魁祸首。",
	"You were enslaved by a hag, a satyr, or some other being and lived in that creature's thrall for {@dice 1d6} years.": "你被一位女巫、半人半兽的仙灵，或其他某种生物奴役，生活在那个生物的控制下{@dice 1d6}年。",
	"Falling from a great height is a significant risk for adventurers and their foes. The rule given in the player's handbook is simple: at the end of a fall, you take {@dice 1d6} bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet you fell, to a maximum of {@dice 20d6}. You also land {@condition prone}, unless you somehow avoid taking damage from the fall. Here are two optional rules that expand on that simple rule.": "从高处坠落对冒险者和他们的敌人来说是一个重大风险。玩家手册中给出的规则很简单：在一次坠落结束时，你每跌落10英尺，就会受到{@dice 1d6} 钝击伤害，最多不超过{@dice 20d6}。你也会落地{@condition prone}，除非你以某种方式避免了坠落伤害。以下是两个扩展这一简单规则的可选规则。",
	"A flying creature in flight falls if it is knocked {@condition prone}, if its speed is reduced to 0 feet, or if it otherwise loses the ability to move, unless it can hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as the {@spell fly} spell.": "一只正在飞行的飞行生物会掉落，如果它被击倒{@condition prone}，速度降至0英尺，或者失去移动能力，除非它可以悬停，或者被魔法支撑在空中，比如{@spell fly}法术。",
	"If you'd like a flying creature to have a better chance of surviving a fall than a non-flying creature does, use this rule: subtract the creature's current flying speed from the distance it fell before calculating falling damage. This rule is helpful to a flier that is knocked {@condition prone} but is still conscious and has a current flying speed that is greater than 0 feet. The rule is designed to simulate the creature flapping its wings furiously or taking similar measures to slow the velocity of its fall.": "如果你希望飞行生物在坠落时比非飞行生物有更好的生存机会，可以使用这个规则：在计算坠落伤害之前，从生物当前的飞行速度中减去它坠落的距离。这个规则对于一个被击晕的飞行生物是有帮助的，但它仍然清醒并且当前的飞行速度大于0英尺。这个规则旨在模拟生物拼命拍打翅膀或采取类似措施来减缓坠落速度。",
	"If you use the rule for rate of falling in the previous section, a flying creature descends 500 feet on the turn when it falls, just as other creatures do. But if that creature starts any of its later turns still falling and is {@condition prone}, it can halt the fall on its turn by spending half its flying speed to counter the {@condition prone} condition (as if it were standing up in midair).": "如果你使用前一节中关于下落速率的规则，一只飞行生物在下落时会在其转弯时下降500英尺，就像其他生物一样。但如果该生物在后续转弯中仍在下落并且是{@condition prone}，它可以通过花费其飞行速度的一半来对抗{@condition prone}状态，在自己的回合中停止下落（就像它在半空中站立起来一样）。",
	"Just as in the real world, D&D characters spend many hours sleeping, most often as part of a long rest. Most monsters also need to sleep. While a creature sleeps, it is subjected to the {@condition unconscious} condition. Here are a few rules that expand on that basic fact.": "就像在现实世界中一样，D&D角色花费许多时间睡觉，通常作为长休的一部分。大多数怪物也需要睡眠。当一个生物睡觉时，它会受到{@condition unconscious}状态的影响。以下是一些扩展这一基本事实的规则。",
	"Whispers don't disturb sleep, unless a sleeper's passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score is 20 or higher and the whispers are within 10 feet of the sleeper. Speech at a normal volume awakens a sleeper if the environment is otherwise silent (no wind, birdsong, crickets, street sounds, or the like) and the sleeper has a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 15 or higher.": "悄悄话不会打扰睡眠，除非睡者的被动感知力({@skill Perception})得分达到20或更高，并且悄悄话在睡者身边10英尺内。在环境安静（没有风声、鸟鸣、蟋蟀声、街道声音等）的情况下，以正常音量说话会唤醒睡者，如果睡者的被动感知力({@skill Perception})得分达到15或更高。",
	"Whenever you end a 24-hour period without finishing a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of {@condition exhaustion}.": "每当你在24小时内没有完成一次长休时，你必须成功通过一次DC 10的体质豁免才能避免受到一级{@condition exhaustion}。",
	"It becomes harder to fight off {@condition exhaustion} if you stay awake for multiple days. After the first 24 hours, the DC increases by 5 for each consecutive 24-hour period without a long rest. The DC resets to 10 when you finish a long rest.": "如果你连续多天不休息，抵抗{@condition exhaustion}会变得更加困难。在第一天后的24小时内，每连续24小时没有进行长休的话，难度等级会增加5点。当你完成一次长休时，难度等级会重置为10。",
	"The creature who ties the knot makes an Intelligence ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check when doing so. The total of the check becomes the DC for an attempt to untie the knot with an Intelligence ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check or to slip out of it with a Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check.": "系结的生物在这样做时进行一个智力检定（{@skill Sleight of Hand}）。检定的总值成为尝试用智力检定或用敏捷检定来解开结或滑出结的DC。分别为{@skill Sleight of Hand}和{@skill Acrobatics}。",
	"This rule intentionally links {@skill Sleight of Hand} with Intelligence, rather than Dexterity. This is an example of how to apply the rule in the {@variantrule Skills with Different Abilities|phb|\"Variant: Skills with Different Abilities\"} section in chapter 7 of the player's handbook.": "这个规则故意将{@skill Sleight of Hand}与智力联系起来，而不是敏捷。这是如何在玩家手册第7章的{@variantrule Skills with Different Abilities|phb|\"Variant: Skills with Different Abilities\"}部分应用规则的一个例子。",
	"In addition, consider giving characters who have both a relevant skill and a relevant tool proficiency an added benefit on a successful check. This benefit might be in the form of more detailed information or could simulate the effect of a different sort of successful check. For example, a character proficient with {@item mason's tools|phb} makes a successful Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to find a secret door in a stone wall. Not only does the character notice the door's presence, but you decide that the tool proficiency entitles the character to an automatic success on an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to determine how to open the door.": "此外，考虑给予那些既具备相关技能又具备相关工具熟练度的角色在成功检定时额外的好处。这个好处可以是提供更详细的信息，或者模拟另一种成功检定的效果。例如，一个擅长使用{@item mason's tools|phb}的角色成功进行了一次智慧检定来找到石墙上的一个秘密门。角色不仅注意到了门的存在，而且你可以决定工具熟练度使角色在进行一次智力检定时自动成功，以确定如何打开这扇门。",
	"To prepare for using a simple trap in play, start by making note of the characters' passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) scores. Most traps allow Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks to detect their triggers or other elements that can tip off their presence. If you stop to ask players for this information, they might suspect a hidden danger.": "为了准备在游戏中使用一个简单的陷阱，首先要记下角色们的被动感知力({@skill Perception})分数。大多数陷阱允许进行感知力({@skill Perception})检定来发现它们的触发器或其他可能暴露它们存在的元素。如果你停下来询问玩家这些信息，他们可能会怀疑有隐藏的危险。",
	"A trigger requires a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check if simply spotting it reveals its nature. The characters can foil a pit trap hidden by a leaf-covered net if they spot the pit through a gap in the leaves. A trip wire is foiled if it is spotted, as is a pressure plate.": "如果仅仅发现一个触发器并揭示其本质需要进行一个智力检定({@skill Perception})。角色们可以通过叶子间的缝隙发现坑洞从而破坏被叶子覆盖的陷阱。发现绊线或者压力板也能破坏它们。",
	"Other traps require careful inspection and deduction to notice. A doorknob opens a door when turned to the left, but activates a trap when turned to the right. Such a subtle trap requires a successful Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to notice. The trigger is obvious. Understanding its nature is not.": "其他陷阱需要仔细检查和推理才能注意到。当向左转动时，门把手会打开门，但当向右转动时会触发陷阱。这样一个微妙的陷阱需要成功的智力检定({@skill Investigation})才能注意到。触发器是显而易见的。理解其本质则不是。",
	"Not all of the characters' options need to be focused on stopping a trap from operating. Think of what characters can do to mitigate or avoid a trap's effects. Making the trap vulnerable to this sort of effort is a way to engage characters who might be ill-suited to confront the trap directly. A successful Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check might provide insight into the imagery displayed by a trap in a temple or shrine, giving other characters a clue about how and where to direct their efforts. A character could stand in front of a dart trap while holding a shield that the darts can target harmlessly, while other characters trigger that element as they work to disable it.": "并非所有角色的选择都需要专注于阻止陷阱运作。考虑角色可以采取什么行动来减轻或避免陷阱的影响。使陷阱对这种努力脆弱是一种吸引那些可能不适合直接对抗陷阱的角色的方式。成功的智力检定（{@skill Religion}）可能会揭示一个寺庙或神殿中陷阱展示的意象，为其他角色提供线索，指导他们如何以及在哪里集中努力。一个角色可以站在飞镖陷阱前，同时持盾牌，让飞镖可以无害地瞄准，而其他角色则触发该元素，以便他们努力将其解除。",
	"A character seeking to buy a magic item makes a Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check to determine the quality of the seller found. The character gains a +1 bonus on the check for every workweek beyond the first that is spent seeking a seller and a +1 bonus for every additional 100 gp spent on the search, up to a maximum bonus of +10. The monetary cost includes a wealthy lifestyle, for a buyer must impress potential business partners.": "一个角色想要购买一个魔法物品，需要进行一个魅力检定({@skill Persuasion})来确定找到的卖家的质量。角色在寻找卖家的第一个工作周之后，每多花费一个工作周在寻找上就会获得+1的奖励，并且每多花费100金币在搜索上就会获得+1的奖励，最多可以获得+10的奖励。购买的金钱成本包括了富裕的生活方式，因为买家必须给潜在的商业伙伴留下深刻印象。",
