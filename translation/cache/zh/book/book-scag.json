	"Hail and well met, traveler! Welcome to a world of magic and adventure. Originally created by Ed Greenwood, the Forgotten Realms setting has been home to Dungeons & Dragons stories and games for decades. Built for tales of swords and sorcery, the Realms initially grew and flourished in Ed's D&D campaign, which featured heroes like the Knights of Myth Drannor in the Dalelands. Ed also shared glimpses of the Realms in the pages of Dragon magazine, giving D&D players their first tales from the wizard Elminster, the old sage of Shadowdale, who occasionally found his way through a portal between Faerûn and our world and into Ed's living room.": "万岁，你好，旅行者! 欢迎来到一个充满魔法和冒险的世界。被遗忘的领域最初由艾德-格林伍德创造，几十年来一直是《龙与地下城》故事和游戏的家园。为剑与魔法的故事而建，该领域最初在艾德的D&D活动中发展和繁荣，其中有像达勒兰的神话德兰诺骑士这样的英雄。埃德还在《龙》杂志的页面上分享了王国的一瞥，为D&D玩家提供了来自巫师埃尔明斯特的第一个故事，他是影子谷的老圣人，偶尔会通过法鲁恩和我们的世界之间的门户，进入埃德的客厅。",
	"When TSR, the company that owned D&D at the time, sought a new campaign world to expand the D&D multiverse, they chose the Forgotten Realms, and in 1987, the gates were flung wide for players and Dungeon Masters all over the world to come to Faerûn and create their own heroic tales. A year later, author R.A. Salvatore introduced readers to the adventures of the drow outcast Drizzt Do'Urden in his first novel, The Crystal Shard, establishing the Underdark as an essential part of the Realms.": "当当时拥有D&D的TSR公司寻求一个新的战役世界来扩展D&D的多元宇宙时，他们选择了被遗忘的领域，在1987年，大门被打开，全世界的玩家和地下城主都可以来到Faerûn，创造他们自己的英雄故事。一年后，作者R.A. Salvatore在他的第一部小说《水晶碎片》中向读者介绍了被抛弃的鸦人Drizzt Do'Urden的冒险故事，确立了暗黑世界作为王国的重要组成部分。",
	"In the years since, the Forgotten Realms have played host to a vast number of game products, novels, video games, and more, making it one of the most widely visited fantasy settings ever created. The lost portals to the Realms have returned and remained open in the depths of our imaginations and do so to this day, as more and more visitors find their way there.": "在那之后的几年里，被遗忘的王国成为了大量游戏产品、小说、视频游戏等的主人，使其成为有史以来访问量最大的奇幻背景之一。随着越来越多的游客来到这里，被遗忘的领域的门户又回来了，并在我们的想象力的深处保持开放，直到今天也是如此。",
	"It is no surprise, then, that the Forgotten Realms became the setting for the first adventures for fifth edition Dungeons & Dragons. Already, new heroes have accomplished great deeds and saved Faerûn from terrible evil and will continue to do so, as long as the flame of imagination draws them there.": "因此，被遗忘的领域成为第五版《龙与地下城》第一批冒险的背景并不奇怪。新的英雄们已经完成了伟大的事迹，将法鲁恩从可怕的邪恶中拯救出来，并将继续这样做，只要想象力的火焰将他们吸引到那里。",
	"This book is further fuel for the fire sparked by those adventures and the glimpses of the Realms you can find in the fifth edition Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual. It gives you a broad look at the continent of Faerûn and the world of Toril in general, and the regions of the Sword Coast and the North in particular.": "本书是这些冒险和第五版《玩家手册》、《地下城主指南》和《怪物手册》中对王国的一瞥所引发的火种的进一步推动。它让你对法鲁恩大陆和托里尔世界有一个大致的了解，特别是剑海岸和北方地区。",
	"In these pages, you'll learn about the history, lands, and peoples of Faerûn, of the great city-states of the Sword Coast and the North, of the world's gods, and of the factions and forces that support and threaten civilization. Chapter 1 of this book gives an overview of the Sword Coast and nearby lands, its history, the role of magic, and its religions. Chapter 2 goes into detail about the cities and other locations of the Sword Coast. Chapter 3 gives history and some game material for various races and subraces, both common and uncommon, that can be met on the Sword Coast and in the North. Chapter 4 shows how the character options in the Player's Handbook fit into this region and presents new character class options specific to the Forgotten Realms. Chapter 5 gives backgrounds designed to link your characters to the great places, people, and events of Faerûn.": "在这些页面中，你将了解到法鲁恩的历史、土地和人民，了解到剑海岸和北方的伟大城邦，了解到这个世界的神灵，以及支持和威胁文明的派别和力量。本书第1章概述了剑海岸和附近的土地、其历史、魔法的作用以及其宗教。第二章详细介绍了剑海岸的城市和其他地点。第3章给出了在剑海岸和北方可以遇到的各种种族和亚种族的历史和一些游戏材料，包括普通和不普通的种族。第4章展示了《玩家手册》中的角色选项如何适应这一地区，并介绍了被遗忘的领域特有的新角色类别选项。第五章给出了旨在将你的角色与法鲁恩的伟大地方、人物和事件联系起来的背景。",
	"While the body of Realms lore is vast, and this book is only an introduction, the Forgotten Realms setting—like D&D itself—is yours, and has been ever since Ed opened that first portal and invited us to come and visit. The Realms are a place to create and tell your stories, about your adventurers and their deeds. The lands and peoples of Faerûn welcome you, traveler, for it is a place of peril sorely in need of the heroes you will bring forth. Go now, through the portal of imagination and into vast and wonderful realms awaiting beyond.": "虽然境界的传说非常庞大，而且本书只是一个介绍，但被遗忘的境界的设定就像D&D本身一样，是属于你的，而且自从Ed打开第一个入口并邀请我们来参观时就一直如此。境界是一个创造和讲述你的故事的地方，关于你的冒险者和他们的事迹。法鲁恩的土地和人民欢迎你，旅行者，因为它是一个充满危险的地方，非常需要你带来的英雄们。现在就去吧，穿过想象力的门户，进入等待着的广阔而奇妙的领域。",
	"On the world of Toril, between the windswept Sea of Swords to the west and the mysterious lands of Kara-Tur to the east, lies the continent of Faerûn. A place of varied cultures and races, Faerûn is dominated by human lands, be they kingdoms, city-states, or carefully maintained alliances of rural communities. Interspersed among the lands of humans are old dwarven kingdoms and hidden elven enclaves, assimilated populations of gnomes and halflings, and more exotic folk.": "在托里尔世界，西边是风起云涌的剑海，东边是神秘的卡拉图尔，这就是法鲁恩大陆。法鲁恩是一个拥有不同文化和种族的地方，它以人类的土地为主，无论是王国、城邦，还是精心维护的农村社区联盟。在人类的土地上，穿插着古老的矮人王国和隐蔽的精灵飞地，被同化的地精和半身人，以及更多的异国人民。",
	"A great deal of adventure is to be had in the Realms, for those willing to seek it out. The routes between cities and nations often cross into the territory of brigands or marauding humanoids. Every forest, swamp, and mountain range has its own perils, whether lurking bandits, savage orcs and goblinoids, or mighty creatures such as giants and dragons. Ruins dot the landscape and the caverns that wind beneath the surface. In these places, treasures of every living race—and a number of dead ones—wait for adventurers intrepid enough to come and claim them.": "对于那些愿意寻求冒险的人来说，在王国中可以获得大量的冒险机会。城市和国家之间的路线经常会穿越到强盗或掠夺性人类的领地。每个森林、沼泽和山脉都有自己的危险，无论是潜伏的强盗、野蛮的兽人和哥布林诺人，还是巨人和龙等强大的生物。遗迹点缀着风景和地表下蜿蜒的岩洞。在这些地方，每一个活着的种族的宝藏--以及一些死去的种族--都在等待着足够勇敢的冒险家来认领它们。",
	"Faerûn is filled with rich history and wondrous tales of adventure and magic, but the lifeblood of its common people is agriculture and trade. Most rural folk depend on farming to eat, and Faerûnians who live in cities ply skilled trades or use brawn to earn their keep, so they can purchase the goods and food provided by others. News and gossip are carried between population centers by caravans and ships that bring in supplies for trade and by traveling bards and minstrels who recount (or invent) stories to inform and entertain people in taverns, inns, and castles. Adventurers also spread news—while also creating it!": "法鲁恩充满了丰富的历史和奇妙的冒险与魔法故事，但其普通人的命脉是农业和贸易。大多数农村居民依靠耕种来维持生计，而生活在城市的法鲁尼人则从事熟练的贸易或利用体力来赚取生活费，因此他们可以购买别人提供的商品和食物。新闻和流言蜚语通过商队和船只在人口中心之间传播，这些商队和船只为贸易带来物资，而游吟诗人和吟游诗人则在酒馆、旅馆和城堡中讲述（或编造）故事，以告知和娱乐人们。冒险家们也在传播新闻--同时也在创造新闻!",
	"The common folk of Faerûn look on adventurers with a mixture of admiration, envy, and mistrust. Folk believe that any stalwarts willing to risk their lives on behalf of complete strangers should be lauded and rewarded. But such adventurers, if they become successful, amass wealth and personal status at a rate that some people find alarming. Even people who admire these adventurers for their energy and their acts of valor might have misgivings: what horrors will be unleashed if adventurers, heedless or unknowing of the danger, unlock a ruin or a tomb and release an ancient evil into the world?": "法鲁恩的普通民众对冒险者的看法是混合着钦佩、羡慕和不信任。民众认为，任何愿意为完全陌生的人冒生命危险的中坚力量都应该得到赞扬和奖励。但是这样的冒险家，如果他们成功了，就会以一些人认为令人震惊的速度积累财富和个人地位。即使是那些因其精力和英勇行为而钦佩这些冒险家的人，也可能会有疑虑：如果冒险家不注意或不知道危险，打开一个废墟或坟墓，把一个古老的邪恶释放到这个世界上，会有什么恐怖的事情发生？",
	"Most of the people who populate the continent have little or no knowledge of lands outside Faerûn. The most educated among the populace agree that Faerûn is but one continent and that Toril is the whole of the world, but for the majority of people, who don't experience intercontinental travel or extraplanar exploration, \"Faerûn\" is more than large enough of a concept for them to comprehend.": "大多数居住在大陆上的人对Faerûn以外的土地几乎一无所知。受教育程度最高的民众同意Faerûn只是一个大陆，而Toril是世界的全部，但对于大多数人来说，他们没有经历过洲际旅行或星外探索，\"Faerûn \"对他们来说是一个足够大的概念。",
	"Except in the most remote or insular places, Faerûnians are accustomed to seeing people of different cultures, ethnicities, and races. Only in the most cosmopolitan areas does such casual acceptance extend to evil humanoid races—such as goblinoids, orcs, and drow—to say nothing of even more dangerous creatures. Adventurers tend to be more tolerant, accepting exiles, misfits, and redeemed folk from strange lands and with unusual shapes.": "除了在最偏远的地方，法鲁尼人习惯于看到不同文化、民族和种族的人。只有在最国际化的地区，这种随意的接受才会延伸到邪恶的人形种族--如哥布林人、兽人和乌鸦--更不用说更危险的生物。冒险家们倾向于更加宽容，接受流亡者、不合群者和来自陌生土地和具有不寻常形状的被救赎者。",
	"Running along the Sea of Swords from north of Amn to the Sea of Moving Ice, the Sword Coast is a narrow band of territory dominated by the city-states of the area that use the sea for trade. For most who care about such things, the area is delimited by Neverwinter in the north and Baldur's Gate in the south, but territory farther to the north and south that isn't under the sway of a more influential power is usually also included in maps of the Sword Coast.": "沿着剑海从安恩以北到移动冰海，剑海岸是一个狭窄的领土带，由该地区的城邦主导，利用海洋进行贸易。对于大多数关心这些事情的人来说，该地区以北部的永夜城和南部的博德之门为界，但在北部和南部更远的地区，如果不在一个更有影响力的大国的控制之下，通常也包括在剑海岸的地图上。",
	"More broadly, the North refers to all the territory north of Amn, split into two general regions: the Western Heartlands and the Savage Frontier. The Western Heartlands encompasses a narrow strip of civilization running from the Sunset Mountains to the Sea of Swords, and northward from the band of territory marked by the Cloud Peaks and the Troll Mountains to the Trade Way. The Savage Frontier is the name given to the rest of the unsettled or sparsely settled territory in the North, not including the major cities and towns and any settlements in their immediate spheres of influence.": "更广泛地说，北方指的是安恩以北的所有领土，分为两个大区：西部腹地和野蛮边境。西部腹地包括从落日山脉到剑海的狭窄文明地带，以及从云峰和巨魔山脉标志的领土带向北到贸易之路。野蛮边境是对北方其余未定居或定居稀少的领土的称呼，不包括主要城市和城镇以及其直接影响范围内的任何定居点。",
	"Most of the communities, nations, and governments of the North can be grouped into five categories: the cities and towns that are members of the Lords' Alliance, the dwarfholds that have been built throughout the area, the island kingdoms off the coast, the independent realms scattered up and down the coast, and the subterranean environs of the Underdark. Each category is discussed briefly here; more details can be found in chapter 2.": "北方的大多数社区、国家和政府可以归为五类：作为领主联盟成员的城市和城镇、在整个地区建立的矮人家庭、沿海的岛屿王国、散布在沿海的独立王国，以及地下世界的地下环境。这里对每个类别进行了简要的讨论；更多的细节可以在第二章找到。",
	"The Lords' Alliance is a confederation among the rulers of various northern settlements. The number of members on the Council of Lords, the group's governing body, shifts depending on the changing status of member cities and political tensions in the region. Currently, the Lords' Alliance counts these individuals as council members:": "领主联盟是北方各个定居点的统治者之间的一个联盟。领主理事会是该组织的管理机构，其成员的数量根据成员城市的地位变化和该地区的政治紧张局势而变化。目前，领主联盟将这些人算作理事会成员。",
	"Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep": "Laeral Silverhand, Waterdeep的开放领主",
	"Dagult Neverember, Lord Protector of Neverwinter": "达古特-纽文伯，永无止境的保护者大人",
	"Taern Hornblade, High Mage of Silverymoon": "Taern Hornblade，银月城的高级法师",
	"Ulder Ravengard, Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate and Marshal of the Flaming Fist": "乌尔德-拉文加德，博德之门的大公爵和烈焰之拳的元帅",
	"Morwen Daggerford, Duchess of Daggerford": "Morwen Daggerford, Daggerford公爵夫人",
	"Selin Ramur, Marchion of Mirabar": "塞林-拉穆尔，米拉巴尔的行进者",
	"Dowell Harpell of Longsaddle": "龙赛德的道尔-哈佩尔",
	"Dagnabbet Waybeard, Queen of Mithral Hall": "Dagnabbet Waybeard, Mithral Hall的女王",
	"Lord Dauner Ilzimmer of Amphail": "安培尔的道纳-伊尔齐默勋爵",
	"Nestra Ruthiol, Waterbaron of Yartar": "内斯特拉-鲁西奥尔，雅尔塔的水巴龙",
	"The Lords' Alliance includes the strongest mercantile powers of the North. In addition to providing military support and a forum for the peaceful airing of differences, the Alliance has always acted under the principle that communities with common cause that engage in trade are less likely to go to war with one another. By maintaining strong trade ties within the alliance as well as outside it, the Lords' Alliance helps to keep the peace.": "领主联盟包括北方最强大的商贾势力。除了提供军事支持和和平解决分歧的论坛外，联盟还一直遵循这样的原则：有共同事业的社区如果从事贸易，就不太可能相互开战。通过在联盟内部和外部保持强有力的贸易联系，领主联盟有助于维持和平。",
	"The various dwarven communities of the North are the heirs and survivors of Delzoun, the great Northkingdom of long ago. Despite continually warring over the centuries with the orcs and goblinoids of the region, and having to fight off assaults from below by duergar and drow, the shield dwarves have stood fast, determined to hold their halls against all threats—and, when necessary, reclaim them.": "北方的各个矮人社区是很久以前伟大的北方王国Delzoun的继承人和幸存者。尽管几个世纪以来不断与该地区的兽人和哥布林人发生战争，并不得不抵御来自地下的杜尔加人和乌鸦的攻击，但盾牌矮人一直坚守着，决心坚守他们的大厅，抵御所有的威胁，并在必要时夺回它们。",
	"Holds that survive from the days of Delzoun include Mithral Hall, Citadel Adbar, and Citadel Felbarr. The fabled city of Gauntlgrym, built by the Delzoun dwarves and recently taken back from the drow, stands as a beacon of resurgent dwarven strength in the North. Stoneshaft Hold and Ironmaster are lonely settlements continually girding themselves for threats real and imagined. Sundabar and Mirabar are also generally considered dwarfholds, despite their substantial human populations.": "从德尔祖恩时代流传下来的堡垒包括米特拉厅（Mithral Hall）、阿德巴城堡（Citadel Adbar）和费尔巴城堡（Citadel Felbarr）。传说中的Gauntlgrym城，由德尔祖恩矮人建造，最近从乌鸦手中夺回，是北方矮人力量复苏的灯塔。石头堡和铁匠铺是孤独的定居点，他们不断为现实和想象中的威胁做好准备。Sundabar和Mirabar通常也被认为是矮人区，尽管他们有大量的人类人口。",
	"Until recently, many of the dwarfholds were members of the Silver Marches (also known as Luruar), an alliance of cities that provided mutual protection across the North. Disagreements and failed obligations during a war with the orc kingdom of Many-Arrows destroyed the remaining trust between members of the Marches, and that pact is no more. The dwarfholds still ally with one another, and individually with nearby human realms, but no longer pledge to stand unified with all their neighbors.": "直到最近，许多矮人家庭都是银色山脉（也被称为Luruar）的成员，这是一个在整个北方提供相互保护的城市联盟。在与兽人王国Many-Arrows的战争中，分歧和失败的义务破坏了马尔奇成员之间剩余的信任，该协议不再存在。矮人家族仍然彼此结盟，并单独与附近的人类王国结盟，但不再保证与所有的邻居团结一致。",
	"Off the western coast of Faerûn are a number of island realms of varying size. The most distant, and yet perhaps the most symbolically important to the mainland, is Evermeet, the island paradise of the elves, reputed to be a part of the divine realm of Arvandor. Much closer to Faerûn are the Whalebones and Ruathym, ancient homes of the ancestors of the Illuskan people, and the Moonshaes, where many of those same people now share the islands with the Ffolk and an elf offshoot known as the Llewyr. The free port of Mintarn lies nearby, a neutral site for meetings between enemies and a recruitment spot that offers abundant jobs for sailors. Despite its size, the tiny island of Orlumbor, with its treacherous harbor and its skilled, in-demand shipwrights, is an independent and influential nation unto itself.": "在法鲁恩的西海岸，有许多大小不一的岛屿王国。最遥远的，但也许是对大陆最具象征意义的，是精灵的天堂--埃弗米特岛，据说是阿凡多神域的一部分。离法鲁恩更近的是 \"鲸骨\"（Whalebones）和 \"鲁阿西姆\"（Ruathym），这是伊鲁斯坎人祖先的古老家园，还有 \"月海\"（Moonshaes），现在许多同族人与弗福克人和一个被称为 \"勒维尔 \"的精灵分支共享这些岛屿。敏塔恩的自由港就在附近，是敌人之间会面的中立地点，也是为水手提供大量工作的招募点。尽管面积不大，小小的奥伦博尔岛却拥有险恶的港口和技术精湛、需求旺盛的船工，是一个独立而有影响力的国家。",
	"In the seas to the south, pirates of many races and predilections sail from the Nelanther Isles, preying on trade running north and south along the coasts. Since the beginning of the Sundering, fabled Lantan and Nimbral have returned. Both the center of invention and the isle of Leira-worshiping illusionists are even more secretive and less welcoming of strangers than before their disappearance.": "在南边的海域，许多种族和偏好的海盗从尼兰特群岛出发，掠夺沿海岸线的南北贸易。自分裂开始以来，传说中的兰坦和尼姆布拉尔已经回归。发明的中心和崇拜莱拉的幻术师的岛屿都比他们消失前更加神秘，对陌生人也不那么欢迎。",
	"Interspersed among the fortresses of the dwarves and the settlements protected by the Lords' Alliance are significant sites that have no collective character, except that they exist largely outside the protection or purview of the great powers of the region. Even the civilized locales among these places, such as Elturgard, exist, at best, in an uneasy tension with the denizens of the wilder lands within and just outside their borders, and survive only through constant vigilance and the steady recruitment of new defenders.": "在矮人的堡垒和受领主联盟保护的定居点中，有一些重要的地方没有集体特征，只是它们在很大程度上存在于该地区大国的保护或权限之外。即使是这些地方中的文明地区，如Elturgard，充其量也只是与边界内外的荒野之地的居民存在着一种不安的紧张关系，只有通过不断的警惕和不断招募新的保卫者才能生存。",
	"A great variety of independent nations and notable locations is encompassed within the wild lands of the North. Among them are the great library of Candlekeep, home of the greatest collection of written lore in Faerûn; the imposing, giant-scale castle of Darkhold; the fortified abbey of Helm's Hold; sites of great battles such as Boareskyr Bridge and the Fields of the Dead; realms of some security, such as Elturgard and Hartsvale; and the yuan-ti realm of Najara. The lands of the Uthgardt, the towns of frigid Icewind Dale, the quiet Trielta Hills, the cutthroat city of Luskan, and the legendary Warlock's Crypt, dominion of the great lich Larloch, are all independent realms, as are the High Moor, the Trollclaws, and the High Forest.": "北方的荒野之地包含了大量的独立国家和著名地点。其中有伟大的烛台图书馆，它是法鲁恩最大的文字传说收藏地；气势恢宏、规模巨大的暗黑城堡；坚固的赫尔姆港修道院；伟大的战役遗址，如博阿里斯基尔桥和死亡之域；一些安全的领域，如埃尔图加德和哈茨维尔；以及纳贾拉的元老国度。乌斯加德的土地、寒冷的冰风谷城镇、宁静的特里尔塔山、残酷的卢斯坎城，以及传说中的术士墓穴，伟大的巫师拉罗克的统治地，都是独立的领域，高沼泽、巨魔堡垒和高森林也是如此。",
	"There is much danger and adventure to be had in the free places of the North, and a great deal of wealth and treasure as well. The ruins of ancient kingdoms and countless smaller settlements litter the countryside, waiting for the right explorers to happen upon them.": "在北方的自由之地，有许多危险和冒险，也有大量的财富和宝藏。古代王国的废墟和无数的小型定居点遍布乡间，等待着合适的探险家去发现它们。",
	"Extending miles downward and outward beneath the surface of Faerûn, and reaching to other continents as well, the great network of subterranean caverns known as the Underdark is home to all manner of strange and deadly creatures. Duergar and drow—dark reflections of dwarves and elves—live in these sunless lands, as do the svirfneblin, or deep gnomes. Most surface-dwelling folk aren't threatened or even disturbed by denizens of the deep places, but the creatures occasionally emerge to raid or to seek some kind of goal in the surface world.": "在Faerûn的地表下向外延伸数英里，并延伸到其他大陆，被称为暗黑的巨大地下洞穴网络是各种奇怪和致命生物的家园。Duergar和drow--矮人和精灵的黑暗反射--生活在这些没有阳光的土地上，就像svirfneblin，或深层地精那样。大多数地表居民不会受到深渊居民的威胁，甚至不会受到干扰，但这些生物偶尔会出现在地表世界，进行袭击或寻求某种目标。",
	"Among the lands of the Underdark beneath the North are the svirfneblin city of Blingdenstone, the duergar city of Gracklstugh, and the infamous drow city of Menzoberranzan. Also prominent is Mantol-Derith, a trading post for Underdark merchants.": "在北境之下的暗黑土地上，有斯维尔芬布林城市布林登斯通（Blingdenstone）、杜尔加城市格拉克斯图（Gracklstugh）和臭名昭著的乌鸦城市门索兰赞（Menzoberranzan）。同样突出的还有曼托尔-德里斯（Mantol-Derith），一个地下城商人的贸易站。",
	"Toril is a vast and wondrous world, filled with an immense diversity of peoples and a rich, full history. For most folk of the Sword Coast, however, knowledge doesn't extend much beyond the confines of the North, and anything \"known\" outside of Faerûn proper is based more in rumor than in fact.": "托里尔是一个广阔而奇妙的世界，充满了巨大的民族多样性和丰富而完整的历史。然而，对于剑海岸的大多数人来说，他们的知识并没有延伸到北方的范围之外，法鲁恩本土之外的任何 \"已知 \"都是基于谣言而非事实的。",
	"The vast central continent of Toril, Faerûn is a land mass divided by a great sea known as the Inner Sea, or the Sea of Fallen Stars. The lands beyond the North can be roughly divided into those to the south and those to the east, becoming more foreign to the folk of the Sword Coast and the North the farther away they are.": "法鲁恩是托里尔广阔的中央大陆，被称为 \"内海 \"或 \"堕落之星之海 \"的大洋所分割。北部以外的土地可以大致分为南部和东部，对于剑海岸和北部的居民来说，越是遥远的地方越是陌生。",
	"Just as \"the North\" describes an area that includes a number of nations and governments, a number of collective terms exist for other regions across Faerûn. Not all such names are used universally, and opinions vary as to which lands qualify in which groups. Here are some currently recognized regional groupings:": "正如 \"北方 \"所描述的区域包括一些国家和政府一样，整个法鲁恩的其他地区也有一些统称。并非所有这类名称都被普遍使用，而且对于哪些土地符合哪些群体的条件也有不同意见。以下是目前公认的一些区域分组。",
	"Damara, Narfell, Sossal, and Vaasa": "达马拉、纳菲尔、索萨和瓦萨",
	"Cormyr, the Dalelands, the Moonsea, and Sembia": "科米尔、达利兰、月海和森比亚",
	"Amn, Calimshan, and Tethyr, also known as the Empires of the Sands": "阿姆、卡利姆山和泰特希尔，也被称为沙场帝国",
	"To the south of the Sword Coast lie ancient nations, a tremendous, forbidding jungle, and all manner of lands destroyed or transformed by magical cataclysms and upheavals. Amid the ruin and the distress in these realms are signs of renewal and hope, as tenacious civilizations and peoples rebuild, reclaim, and create anew.": "在剑海岸的南部，有古老的国家、巨大的、令人生畏的丛林，以及各种被魔法灾难和动荡摧毁或改变的土地。在这些领域的废墟和苦难中，有更新和希望的迹象，因为顽强的文明和人民正在重建、恢复和重新创造。",
	"A nation led by the representatives of five noble families, Amn is a place where the wealthy rule, openly and without pretense. Shrewd traders and ruthless in business, Amnians believe that the end of a successful transaction is justified by any means, ethical or otherwise. Although the nation is richer by far than even the northern metropolises of Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep, its influence is curtailed by the unwillingness of its rulers to work together in the nation's best interest. The members of the Council of Five are fairly unified and tight-fisted in their control of Amn, but their ability to affect events outside their own borders is limited because they can't agree enough on major matters of foreign policy. The oligarchs utterly control their nation, but beyond the areas that each rules, their families and businesses compete with one another and with the locals of far-flung places.": "作为一个由五个贵族家族代表领导的国家，安曼是一个富人统治的地方，公开且不加掩饰。精明的商人和无情的商人，阿姆恩人相信，成功的交易结束后，任何手段都是合理的，不管是道德的还是其他的。虽然这个国家甚至比北方的大都市博德之门和沃特德普还要富有，但由于统治者不愿意为国家的最佳利益而合作，其影响力受到了限制。五人委员会的成员在控制安恩方面相当团结，而且手腕很紧，但他们影响自己边界以外事件的能力有限，因为他们在外交政策的重大问题上无法达成足够的共识。寡头们完全控制着他们的国家，但在各自统治的地区之外，他们的家庭和企业相互竞争，并与遥远地方的当地人竞争。",
	"The use of arcane magic is illegal in Amn, meaning that the only authorized spellcasters in the nation are wielders of divine magic who enjoy the support and patronage of a temple, and users of arcane magic who have been given special dispensation by one of the oligarchs. So pervasive is the sway of Amn's oligarchy that few crimes merit physical punishment but those that involve the use of arcane magic or an offense against one of the council's merchant houses. Other infractions are forgiven after the miscreant makes payment of an appropriate fine.": "在安恩，使用奥术魔法是非法的，这意味着在这个国家，唯一被授权的施法者是享有神庙支持和赞助的神圣魔法的挥舞者，以及得到某个寡头特别豁免的奥术魔法使用者。阿姆的寡头统治是如此普遍，以至于除了那些涉及使用奥术魔法或对议会的某个商行的犯罪行为，很少有犯罪行为值得体罚。其他违法行为在犯罪者支付了适当的罚款后会被宽恕。",
	"This southern land has long been the battleground for warring genies. After years of struggling beneath their genasi masters, human slaves arose to follow a Chosen of Ilmater, at first using nonviolent resistance, and then erupting in full rebellion following his disappearance. They overthrew the genie lords of Calimport and Memnon, casting the remaining genies out of the cities and back to their elemental homes or into the depths of the deserts.": "这片南部土地长期以来一直是交战精灵的战场。经过多年在精灵主人手下的挣扎，人类奴隶起来追随伊尔马特的神选者，起初使用非暴力抵抗，然后在他失踪后爆发了全面的叛乱。他们推翻了卡里姆波特和梅姆农的精灵领主，将剩余的精灵赶出城市，回到他们的元素家园或沙漠的深处。",
	"Much of Calimshan is a chaotic place dominated by wealth, political influence, and personal power. Many pray for the return of the Chosen and the completion of his work. Others are learning to live together without genie masters, and to grudgingly accept the remaining genasi among them.": "卡里姆山的大部分地区是一个由财富、政治影响和个人权力主导的混乱之地。许多人祈祷天选之人的回归和他的工作的完成。其他人正在学习如何在没有精灵主人的情况下共同生活，并勉强接受他们中剩余的精灵。",
	"The vast, choking jungles of Chult hide what many believe to be great mineral wealth, including large gemstones and veins of ore. Poisonous flora and fauna riddle the jungles, but some still brave the dangers to seek their fortunes. Some of the exotic plants that grow only in Chult fetch high prices in mainland markets. Ruined Mezro stands across the sea from Calimshan, waiting for explorers and its displaced people to cleanse the city of its undead inhabitants and uncover the treasures that lie hidden there.": "丘尔特广阔的、令人窒息的丛林中隐藏着许多人认为是巨大的矿物财富，包括大型宝石和矿脉。丛林中遍布有毒的动植物，但有些人仍然冒着危险去寻找财富。一些只生长在楚尔特的奇特植物在大陆市场上卖出了高价。残破的梅兹罗与卡利姆山隔海相望，等待着探险家和流离失所的人们清理城市中的亡灵居民，发掘隐藏在那里的宝藏。",
	"Eastward along the Chultan peninsula lie the remains of Thindol and Samarach. Despite the apparent fall of both civilizations, Thindol remains infested with yuan-ti, while the illusions cloaking Samarach's mountain passes conceal the activities in that nation.": "沿着苏丹半岛向东，是廷多和萨马拉奇的遗迹。尽管这两个文明都已明显衰落，但廷多尔仍然有元老级人物出没，而笼罩在萨马拉奇山口的幻象则掩盖了这个国家的活动。",
	"Situated on a warm plain on the shore of the Great Sea, Dambrath is ruled by nomadic clans of human horse riders who revere Silvanus, Malar, and occasionally Selûne. Given the Dambrathans' history of domination by the Crinti, a ruling caste of half-drow, it is no surprise that they reserve their greatest hatred for the drow.": "坐落在大海之滨的温暖平原上，丹布拉特被人类骑马者的游牧部族所统治，他们崇尚希尔瓦娜斯、马拉尔，偶尔也崇尚塞鲁恩。鉴于Dambrathans被Crinti统治的历史，一个半乌鸦的统治种姓，他们对乌鸦保留最大的仇恨并不奇怪。",
	"The clans meet twice a year at a sacred site known as the Hills of the Kings, where dozens of totem sculptures are preserved. At these gatherings, each clan updates its totem with an account of its exploits over the previous seasons. Many Dambrathans seek out lycanthropy as a means of showing reverence for their favored deity and honoring their heritage.": "各部族每年在一个被称为 \"国王山 \"的圣地聚会两次，那里保存着几十个图腾雕塑。在这些聚会上，每个部族都会更新自己的图腾，讲述自己在前几个季节的经历。许多Dambrathans寻求狼人的帮助，以此来表达对他们喜爱的神灵的敬意，并尊重他们的遗产。",
	"A blasted near-desert north and east of the North Wall mountains bordering Halruaa, Elfharrow isn't a name bestowed by its residents, but rather the sobriquet that travelers use for this violent region. The tribes of xenophobic elves that claim this area don't hesitate to discourage uninvited guests by any means necessary. A simple group of pilgrims might be scared off with some arrows, while a band of hunters or explorers is likely to be killed outright.": "Elfharrow是北墙山脉以北和以东与Halruaa接壤的一片被炸毁的近乎沙漠的地方，它并不是居民赋予的名字，而是旅行者对这个暴力地区的昵称。声称拥有这一地区的排外精灵部落毫不犹豫地用任何必要的手段来阻止不速之客。一群简单的朝圣者可能会被一些箭矢吓跑，而一队猎人或探险家则可能被直接杀死。",
	"Food is sparse in this region, with the forests long since vanished, and as a result the elves of Elfharrow fiercely protect the herds of animals they have cultivated. The elves have no interest in looting the cities of fallen Lapaliiya, but neither are they willing to allow \"adventurers\" free access to those lands through their territory.": "这个地区的食物很稀少，森林早就消失了，因此精灵们激烈地保护着他们培养的动物群。精灵们对掠夺堕落的Lapaliiya的城市没有兴趣，但他们也不愿意让 \"冒险者 \"通过他们的领土自由进入这些土地。",
	"Once believed destroyed in the conflagration of the Spellplague, Halruaa has largely been restored to the insular, magic-mighty nation it once was. Because of the foresight of their divinations, Halruaan wizards were able to use the raging blue fire that followed Mystra's death to propel their nation safely into the realm of Toril's twin, Abeir (displacing part of that world into the Plane of Shadow).": "曾经被认为毁于法术瘟疫的大火，Halruaa在很大程度上已经恢复了它曾经是一个封闭的、魔法强大的国家。由于占卜的先见之明，Halruaan的巫师们能够利用Mystra死亡后的熊熊蓝火，将他们的国家安全地推进到Toril的孪生兄弟Abeir的领域（将那个世界的一部分置换到阴影界）。",

	"Far to the south and east of the Sword Coast, the Lake of Steam is more accurately an inland sea, its waters tainted by volcanism and undrinkable. Around its perimeter is a conglomeration of city-states and minor baronies typified by the shifting domains known as the Border Kingdoms. Here, along the southern shore of the lake, explorers and fortune seekers squander their amassed wealth building castles, founding communities, and drawing loyal vassals to them—only to have all those good works disappear within a generation or two. In some cases, one of these realms is fortunate to be saved from its inevitable decline by another group of successful adventurers, who inject enough wealth and wisdom to keep the enterprise going a few more decades.": "远在剑海岸的南部和东部，蒸汽湖更准确地说，是一个内陆海，它的水被火山污染，无法饮用。在它的周围是城邦和小男爵的联合体，其典型特征是被称为边境王国的变幻不定的领域。在这里，沿着湖的南岸，探险家和财富寻求者挥霍着他们积累的财富，建造城堡，建立社区，并吸引忠诚的附庸，但所有这些善举在一两代人内就消失了。在某些情况下，其中一个王国很幸运地被另一群成功的冒险家从不可避免的衰落中拯救出来，他们注入了足够的财富和智慧，使这个企业再持续数十年。",
	"Long the homeland of halflings and thought to be the place where their race had its genesis, Luiren was lost during the Spellplague to a great inundation of the sea. In the century since that great disaster, the waters receded, and now stories told by travelers from the south tell of halfling communities that survived as island redoubts.": "长期以来，卢伊伦是半身人的故乡，并被认为是他们种族的起源地，但在咒语瘟疫期间，卢伊伦被大海淹没。在那场大灾难之后的一个世纪里，海水退去了，现在来自南方的旅行者讲述的故事中，半身人社区作为岛屿的堡垒而幸存下来。",
	"Tethyr is a feudal realm ruled by Queen Anais from its capital of Darromar.

	"Tethyr has seen more than its share of noble intrigue and royal murder, and adventurers who are native to Tethyr or merely passing through that land are often drawn into such plots, either as unwitting accomplices or as easy scapegoats.": "泰特希尔见证了更多的贵族阴谋和皇室谋杀，而那些土生土长的泰特希尔人或只是路过这片土地的冒险者往往被卷入这样的阴谋，要么成为不知情的帮凶，要么成为容易的替罪羊。",
	"To the east lie many of the older nations of the Realms, including the Western Heartlands of Faerûn—those civilizations centrally located on the continent, and thereby best able to take advantage of trade routes and access to the Sea of Fallen Stars. As in the North, there are cold lands to the east, as well as more temperate regions. As one travels farther from the Sword Coast, one moves from lands not so different from one's own to places so foreign they might as well exist on other continents or worlds—which a few of them actually have done.": "东部是许多古老的王国，包括法鲁恩的西部中心地带--这些文明位于大陆的中心位置，因此最能利用贸易路线和进入堕落星海的机会。和北方一样，东部有寒冷的土地，也有比较温和的地区。当你离开剑海岸越远，你就会从与你自己的土地相差无几的地方转移到如此陌生的地方，它们可能存在于其他大陆或世界上--其中有几个地方实际上已经存在了。",
	"The great peninsula of Aglarond juts out into the Inner Sea, and that body of water and the forests of the Yuirwood define much of the nation's character. A realm of humans living in harmony with their elf and half-elf neighbors, Aglarond has been a foe of Thay for centuries, in part due to the temperament of its former ruler, the Simbul. The nation is now ruled by a Simbarch Council, which has backed away from open hostilities with Thay. With the restoration of the Weave, the ongoing changes to the political landscape, and calls for elven independence within the nation, it is unclear what sort of place Aglarond will be in a generation's time, except that its potential for great change will be realized.": "阿格拉隆的大半岛伸入内海，那片水体和Yuirwood的森林决定了这个国家的大部分特征。阿格拉隆是一个人类与他们的精灵和半精灵邻居和谐相处的王国，几个世纪以来，阿格拉隆一直是泰伊的敌人，部分原因是其前任统治者辛布的脾气。这个国家现在由一个辛巴奇委员会统治，该委员会已经从与泰伊的公开敌对行动中退缩。随着编织术的恢复，政治格局的不断变化，以及国家内部对精灵独立的呼声，目前还不清楚阿格拉隆德在一代人的时间里会是什么样的地方，只是它的巨大变化潜力将被实现。",
	"A collection of city-states bound by common culture and mutual defense, Chessenta isn't truly a nation. Each city boasts its own heroes, worships its own gladiatorial champions, and spends as much time insulting and competing with the other cities as it does on any other activity. The city of Luthcheq is dominated by worship of the bizarre deity known as Entropy, while Erebos is ruled by the latest incarnation of the red dragon known as Tchazzar the Undying. Heptios contains the largest library in Chessenta, a center of learning where all nobles aspire to send their children for tutoring. That city is looked on with disdain by the people of Akanax, whose militant contempt for the \"fat philosophers\" of Heptios is widely known. Toreus welcomes all visitors, even those from lands that are despised or mistrusted, and foreign coin can buy nearly anything there. The floating city of Airspur still flies somehow, its earthmotes unaffected by the fall of its fellows when the Sundering came to a close.": "Chessenta是一个由共同文化和共同防御所组成的城邦集合体，并不是一个真正的国家。每个城市都拥有自己的英雄，崇拜自己的角斗士冠军，花在侮辱和与其他城市竞争的时间和其他活动一样多。Luthcheq城被称为Entropy的怪异神灵的崇拜所支配，而Erebos则被称为不死的Tchazzar的红龙的最新化身所统治。Heptios有Chessenta最大的图书馆，是一个学习中心，所有贵族都渴望把他们的孩子送到这里来接受辅导。阿卡纳克斯的人对这座城市不屑一顾，他们对赫普提斯的 \"胖哲学家 \"的好战蔑视是众所周知的。托雷斯欢迎所有的游客，即使是那些来自被鄙视或不信任的国家的人，外国硬币几乎可以在那里买到任何东西。漂浮在空中的城市仍然在不知不觉中飞翔，它的地动仪并没有因其伙伴们的陨落而受到影响。",
	"For most folk in central Faerûn, the notion of a human kingdom is inextricably linked to Cormyr. A strong realm bolstered by its loyal army (the Purple Dragons), a cadre of magical defenders and investigators (the War Wizards), and numerous wealthy and influential nobles, Cormyr is recovering from its war with Sembia and Netheril—a conflict that cost the nation much, but left the kingdom standing, and which, in the end, Netheril didn't survive. The pride of that victory remains strong in Cormyr's collective consciousness, even as Queen Raedra draws back from plans to permanently welcome into the realm towns that lie beyond Cormyr's traditional borders.": "对于法鲁恩中部的大多数人来说，人类王国的概念与科米尔有着密不可分的联系。科米尔是一个强大的王国，由其忠诚的军队（紫龙）、魔法防御者和调查者（战争巫师）以及众多富有和有影响力的贵族支撑着，科米尔正在从与森比亚和尼瑟尔的战争中恢复过来--这场冲突让国家损失惨重，但却让王国屹立不倒，而且最终尼瑟尔也没能幸存。那场胜利的自豪感在Cormyr的集体意识中依然强烈，即使Raedra女王从永久欢迎Cormyr传统边界以外的城镇的计划中抽身出来。",
	"Cormyreans are justly proud of their homeland, and go to great lengths to guard it and its honor.

Cormyr is many things, but dull isn't one of them.": "科米雷人为自己的祖国感到自豪，并不遗余力地保护它和它的荣誉。尽管如此，森林王国仍然不乏危险，无论是来自阴险狡诈的贵族、来自胡拉克森林或石林的怪物，还是一些古老而隐秘的魔法。科米尔有很多东西，但沉闷并不是其中之一。",

	"In Damara, the usurper King Yarin Frostmantle sits on the throne of the Dragonbane dynasty, while his people complain about his tyranny and the growing threat from demons across the country. In Narfell, skilled riders and archers hunt, raid, and are gradually reclaiming their heritage as a great nation of mages who treated with devils. The Warlock Knights of Vaasa threaten to break the bounds of their nation and invade Damara, the Moonsea, or both, while some of its members suspiciously eye the ominously silent Castle Perilous, perhaps planning another excursion to the place.

They take great pride in their peaceful coexistence with the elves of Cormanthor, and in their ability to remain largely self-sufficient and autonomous even when their homeland was used as a battlefield by Cormyr, Netheril, Sembia, and Myth Drannor in the recent conflicts. Featherdale and Tasseldale have reasserted their independence since the end of the war, and rejoined Archendale, Battledale, Daggerdale, Deepingdale, Harrowdale, Mistledale, Scardale, and Shadowdale on the Dales Council.

Under the leadership of this reincarnated god, the people of Unther rose up as an army to face their masters. On the eve of a great battle, the people of Unther were miraculously returned to their home, and Gilgeam wasted no time in leading them against the dragonborn occupying their ancestral lands. The Untherites have retaken much of the land they formerly held, while seeking to wipe out the \"godless lizards\" they blame for their time of oppression in Abeir.": "被困于另一个世界的Unther人已经屈服于他人的统治。后来在他们中间出现了一个自称吉尔吉安的人，他让他们想起了自己以前的伟大。在这位转世之神的领导下，Unther的人们组成了一支军队，面对他们的主人。在一场大战的前夕，Unther的人民奇迹般地回到了他们的家园，Gilgeam不失时机地带领他们对抗占据他们祖先土地的龙族。乌瑟人夺回了他们以前拥有的大部分土地，同时寻求消灭他们指责的 \"无神的蜥蜴\"，因为他们在阿比尔的时候受到了压迫。",
	"Gilgeam wants nothing short of a complete return to Unther's former glory. This achievement will require utterly destroying Tymanther, of course, and eventual war with Mulhorand to reclaim lands lost centuries ago, but as every Untherite knows, the great God-King is patient, for he is eternal.": "吉尔吉安想要的是完全恢复Unther以前的荣耀。当然，这一成就需要彻底摧毁泰曼瑟，并最终与穆尔霍兰开战，以夺回几个世纪前失去的土地，但正如每个Untherite人所知，伟大的神王是有耐心的，因为他是永恒的。",
	"The dismal city of Westgate isn't a romantic place, but someone seeking employment for shady work, or looking to hire someone for the same, will find few places better suited in all of Faerûn.": "阴暗的西门城并不是一个浪漫的地方，但如果有人想找一份阴暗的工作，或者想雇人做同样的工作，那么在整个法鲁恩，很少有地方比它更适合。",
	"Westgate is considered by some Faerûnians as a harbinger of the eventual fate of places like Amn and Sembia, where coin rules over all other considerations. As in many such places, one's moral outlook is less important in Westgate than one's attitude toward bribery. The city's proximity to Cormyr makes it a breeding ground for that nation's enemies, including the Fire Knives, a guild of thieves and assassins that the naive pretend doesn't exist.": "西门町被一些法鲁尼人认为是安恩和森比亚等地最终命运的预兆，在那里，钱币统治着所有其他的考虑。和许多这样的地方一样，在西门城，一个人的道德观不如他对贿赂的态度重要。这个城市靠近科米尔，这使它成为该国敌人的滋生地，包括火刀会，一个由小偷和刺客组成的行会，天真的人假装不存在。",
	"Far to the east, past the wastes of the Hordelands, lie the empires of Shou Lung, Kozakura, Wa, and the other lands of the vast continent of Kara-Tur. To most people of Faerûn, Kara-Tur is like another world, and the tales told by travelers from its nations seem to confirm it. The gods that humans worship in Faerûn are unknown there, as are common peoples such as gnomes and orcs. Other dragons, neither chromatic nor metallic, dwell in its lands and fly its skies. And its mages practice forms of magic mysterious even to archwizards of Faerûn.": "遥远的东方，经过Hordelands的荒原，是Shou Lung、Kozakura、Wa等帝国，以及Kara-Tur广大大陆的其他土地。对大多数法鲁恩人来说，卡拉图尔就像另一个世界，来自其国家的旅行者所讲述的故事似乎也证实了这一点。人类在法鲁恩崇拜的神灵在那里是不存在的，地精和兽人等普通民族也是如此。其他的龙，既不是彩色的也不是金属的，居住在它的土地上，在它的天空中飞翔。它的法师们修炼的魔法形式甚至对法鲁恩的大魔法师来说也很神秘。",
	"Stories of Kara-Tur tell of gold and jade in great abundance, rich spices, silks, and other goods rare or unknown in western lands—alongside tales of shapechanging spirit-people, horned giants, and nightmare monsters absent in Faerûn.": "卡拉图尔的故事讲述了大量的黄金和玉石、丰富的香料、丝绸和其他在西方土地上罕见或不为人知的商品--以及法鲁恩不存在的变形灵人、有角的巨人和噩梦般的怪物的故事。",
	"Far to the south of Faerûn, beyond Calimshan and even the jungles of Chult, are the Lands of Fate. Surrounded by waters thick with pirates and corsairs, Zakhara is a place less hospitable than most, but still braved by travelers who hope to profit from its exotic goods and strange magics. Like Kara-Tur, Zakhara seems a world away to Faerûnians. It is thought of as a vast desert, sprinkled with glittering cities like scattered gems. Romantic tales abound of scimitar-wielding rogues riding flying carpets and of genies bound in service to humans. Their mages, called sha'ir, practice their magic with the aid of genies and, it is said, might carry the lineage of these elemental beings in their blood.": "在法鲁恩的南部，在卡里姆山甚至楚尔特的丛林之外，是命运之域。扎哈拉被海盗和骑兵包围着，是一个不那么好客的地方，但仍有希望从其异国货物和奇怪的魔法中获利的旅行者勇敢面对。与卡拉图尔一样，扎哈拉对法鲁尼人来说似乎是一个世界。它被认为是一个巨大的沙漠，散布着像散落的宝石一样闪亮的城市。挥舞着弯刀的流氓骑着飞毯的浪漫故事比比皆是，还有为人类服务的精灵。他们的法师被称为sha'ir，在精灵的帮助下练习他们的魔法，据说他们的血液中可能带有这些元素生物的血统。",
	"Farther to the west, past even Evermeet, are untold, unknown lands beyond the Trackless Sea. Many explorers have visited such lands, and some have even returned, bearing tales that change from generation to generation about exotic locales, from island chains that are the sites of countless shipwrecks, to fearsome feather-clad warriors, and vast continents that suddenly appeared where nothing—or something very much different—had rested only seasons prior.": "在西部更远的地方，甚至超过了Evermeet，是无轨之海以外不为人知的未知土地。许多探险家曾访问过这些土地，有些人甚至回来了，带着关于异国情调的故事，从无数沉船的岛链，到可怕的羽衣武士，以及突然出现的广阔大陆，而在此前的几个季节里，那里什么都没有，或者有非常不同的东西。",
	"Nearly every major power of Faerûn has its own currency: coins minted within its borders that represent both its influence and material wealth. Most coins of pure composition and standard weight are accepted at face value across the continent, though not every city-state or nation bothers to mint every sort of coin.": "几乎每个法鲁恩的大国都有自己的货币：在其境内铸造的钱币，代表其影响力和物质财富。大多数成分纯正、重量标准的硬币在整个大陆都被接受为面值，尽管不是每个城邦或国家都愿意铸造各种硬币。",
	"Some of the most commonly found, and widely accepted, currency in the Realms is summarized below. Each grouping is arranged in order of value: copper, silver, electrum, gold, and (when present) platinum. Most people across Faerûn refer to coins by whatever name the issuing government uses, regardless of origin, except for Zhentil Keep—for some reason, all Zhent coins have unflattering epithets associated with them.": "下面总结了一些在王国中最常见的、被广泛接受的货币。每组货币按价值顺序排列：铜、银、电子货币、金和（如果有）白金。整个法鲁恩的大多数人都以发行政府使用的任何名称来称呼硬币，而不考虑其来源，但赞特尔堡除外--出于某种原因，所有赞特的硬币都有与之相关的不光彩的外号。",
	"thumb, falcon, blue eye, golden lion, tricrown": "拇指、猎鹰、蓝眼、金狮、三叉戟",
	"steelpence (an iron coin), hawk, blue eye, noble": "钢便士（一种铁币）、鹰、蓝眼睛、贵族",
	"glint, shield, sword, dragon, unicorn": "闪光、盾牌、剑、龙、独角兽",
	"nib, shard, sambar, dragon, sun": "笔尖、碎片、桑巴、龙、太阳",
	"fang (\"dung-piece\"), talon/naal (\"flea-bit\"), tarenth (\"hardhammer\"), glory (\"weeping wolf\"), platinum glory (\"flat metal gem\")": "獠牙（\"粪块\"），爪子/纳尔（\"跳蚤位\"），塔伦特（\"硬锤\"），荣耀（\"哭泣的狼\"），白金荣耀（\"扁平金属宝石\"）。",
	"Silverymoon also mints two special coins: the moon and the eclipsed moon. The moon is a crescent-shaped, shining blue coin of electrum, valued at 2 unicorns in Silverymoon and nearby settlements, and 1 unicorn everywhere else. The eclipsed moon stamps an electrum moon with a darker silver wedge to complete a round coin. It is worth 5 unicorns within the city, but only 2 unicorns elsewhere.": "银月城还铸造了两种特殊的硬币：月亮和黯淡的月亮。月亮是一种月牙形的、闪亮的蓝色电子币，在银月城和附近的定居点价值2个独角兽，在其他地方价值1个独角兽。黯然失色的月亮盖上了一个带有暗银楔子的电子货币，以完成一个圆形的硬币。它在城市内价值5个独角兽，但在其他地方只有2个独角兽。",
	"Waterdeep has its own coins. The taol is a square piece of brass, worth 2 dragons in the city—and virtually worthless to anyone not trading with Waterdeep. Most traders exchange their taols for standard coins before traveling. The \"harbor moon\" is a palm-sized crescent of platinum inset with electrum, and is worth 50 dragons in the city, 30 dragons elsewhere. Its name comes from its common use in buying large amounts of cargo. Both taols and harbor moons are pierced to enable the bearer to string multiple coins together.": "沃特德普有自己的钱币。taol是一块方形的黄铜，在城市中价值2龙--对于不与沃特德普进行贸易的人来说几乎没有价值。大多数商人在旅行前都会把他们的taol换成标准硬币。港湾之月 \"是一个手掌大小的铂金月牙，上面镶嵌有电子，在城市里价值50龙，在其他地方价值30龙。它的名字来自于它在购买大量货物时的普遍使用。taols和海港之月都有穿孔，使持有者能够将多个硬币串在一起。",
	"Baldur's Gate sets the standard for minting trade bars—ingots of metal (usually silver) of an accepted size and weight used in lieu of great piles of coins or gems for larger transactions. The most common such trade bar is a 5-pound bar 6 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1 inch thick, valued at 25 gp.": "博德之门制定了铸造贸易条的标准--在大型交易中用来代替大堆硬币或宝石的可接受的金属（通常是银）。最常见的贸易条是一根5磅重的条子，长6英寸，宽2英寸，厚1英寸，价值25金币。",
	"Although a number of means exist for marking the days and the passage of time during a year, nearly all folk in Faerûn have adopted the Calendar of Harptos. Even the cultures and races that don't favor this method of marking time are aware of it, with the result that it is recognized across nearly all races, languages, and cultures.": "虽然有许多方法来标记一年中的日子和时间的流逝，但法鲁恩几乎所有的人都采用了《哈普托斯日历》。即使是那些不喜欢这种标记时间方法的文化和种族也知道这种方法，其结果是几乎所有的种族、语言和文化都认可它。",
	"A year on Toril consists of 365 days. In the Calendar of Harptos, the year is divided into twelve months of thirty days, loosely following the synodic cycle of Selûne, the moon. A month is made up of three tendays, also known as rides. Five annual holidays, falling between the months, complete the 365-day calendar. Once every four years, the Calendar of Harptos includes Shieldmeet as a \"leap day\" following Midsummer.": "托里尔的一年由365天组成。在哈普托斯历法中，一年被分为12个月，每30天，松散地遵循月亮塞卢恩的同步周期。一个月由三个工作日组成，也被称为骑行。在各月之间有五个年度假期，完成了365天的日历。每四年一次，《哈普托斯日历》中包括仲夏节之后的 \"闰日\"，即Shieldmeet。",
	"Individual days of a tenday have no special names. Instead, they are denoted by counting from the beginning of the period (\"first day,\" \"second day,\" and so on). Days of the month are designated by a number and the month name. For example, sages would record an event as occurring on \"1 Mirtul\" or \"27 Uktar.\" People might also refer to a given day by its relationship to the current date (\"two tendays from today\") or the nearest holiday (\"three days past Greengrass\").": "一个工作日中的各个日子没有特殊的名称。取而代之的是，它们通过从时期的开始计算来表示（\"第一天\"、\"第二天\"，等等）。每月的日子由数字和月份名称来表示。例如，圣人会记录一个事件发生在 \"1 Mirtul \"或 \"27 Uktar\"。人们也可以通过它与当前日期的关系（\"从今天起的两天\"）或最近的节日（\"格林格拉斯过去三天\"）来指代某一天。",
	"Every nation, faith, and culture across Faerûn has its own special festivals and holidays, the observances of which are governed by the cycles of the sun, the moon, the stars, or some other event. In addition, the Calendar of Harptos specifies five annual festivals keyed to the changing of the seasons and one quadrennial festival that are observed in almost every land, with particular celebrations varying based on local traditions and popular faiths.": "法鲁恩的每个国家、信仰和文化都有自己的特殊节日和假期，其庆祝活动受太阳、月亮、星星或其他事件的周期所支配。此外，《哈普托斯日历》规定了五个与季节变化相关的年度节日和一个四年一度的节日，几乎每个国家都会庆祝这些节日，具体的庆祝活动因当地的传统和流行的信仰而不同。",
	"The first festival day of the year is known generally as Midwinter, though some people name it differently. Nobles and monarchs of the Heartlands look to the High Festival of Winter as a day to commemorate or renew alliances. Commoners in the North, the Moonsea, and other, colder climes celebrate Deadwinter Day as a marking of the midpoint of the cold season, with hard times still ahead, but some of the worst days now past.": "一年中的第一个节日一般被称为中冬节，尽管有些人对它有不同的称呼。心脏地带的贵族和君主们将冬季高级节视为纪念或更新联盟的日子。北方、月海和其他更寒冷地区的平民庆祝死冬节，作为寒冷季节中点的标志，困难时期仍在前方，但一些最糟糕的日子已经过去。",
	"The traditional beginning of spring, Greengrass is celebrated by the display of freshly cut flowers (grown in special hothouses wherever the climate doesn't permit flowers so early) that are given as gifts to the gods or spread among the fields in hopes of a bountiful and speedy growing season.": "绿草是春天的传统开端，人们通过展示新鲜的切花（在气候不允许这么早开花的地方，在特殊的暖房里种植）来庆祝，这些花被作为礼物送给神灵，或在田野里散布，希望有一个丰收和快速的生长季节。",
	"The midpoint of summer is a day of feasting, carousing, betrothals, and basking in the pleasant weather. Storms on Midsummer night are seen as bad omens and signs of ill fortune, and sometimes interpreted as divine disapproval of the romances or marriages sparked by the day's events.": "夏天的中点是盛宴、狂欢、订婚和沐浴在愉快天气中的日子。仲夏夜的风暴被视为坏兆头和不吉利的征兆，有时也被解释为神对这一天的事件所引发的浪漫或婚姻的不认可。",
	"The great holiday of the Calendar of Harptos, Shieldmeet occurs once every four years immediately after Midsummer. It is a day for plain speaking and open council between rulers and their subjects, for the renewal of pacts and contracts, and for treaty making between peoples. Many tournaments and contests of skill are held on Shieldmeet, and most faiths mark the holiday by emphasizing one of their key tenets.": "Shieldmeet是哈普托斯历法中的重要节日，每四年一次，紧随仲夏节之后。在这一天，统治者和他们的臣民之间可以畅所欲言，公开讨论，续订盟约和合同，以及人民之间签订条约。在Shieldmeet上会举行许多锦标赛和技能竞赛，大多数信仰都会通过强调其关键信条之一来纪念这个节日。",
	"The next Shieldmeet will be observed in 1492 DR.": "下一次Shieldmeet将在1492年举行。",
	"A day of feasting and thanks, Highharvestide marks the fall harvest. Most humans give thanks to Chauntea on this day for a plentiful bounty before winter approaches. Many who make their living by traveling road or sea set out immediately following the holiday, before winter comes on in full force and blocks mountain passes and harbors.": "这是一个充满盛宴和感谢的日子，Highharvestide标志着秋季的收获。大多数人在这一天向Chauntea表示感谢，感谢它在冬天来临之前提供了丰厚的赏赐。许多以公路或海上旅行为生的人在节日过后立即出发，赶在冬季全面到来之前，封锁山路和港口。",
	"As nights lengthen and winter winds begin to approach, the Feast of the Moon is the time when people celebrate their ancestors and their honored dead. During festivals on this day, people gather to share stories and legends, offer prayers for the fallen, and prepare for the coming cold.": "随着夜晚的延长和冬风的来临，月亮节是人们庆祝他们的祖先和受尊敬的死者的时候。在这一天的节日里，人们聚集在一起分享故事和传说，为死去的人祈祷，并为即将到来的寒冷做准备。",
	"Most people don't keep track of the time of day beyond notions such as \"mid-morning\" or \"nigh sunset.\" If people plan to meet at a particular time, they tend to base their arrangements around such expressions.": "大多数人除了 \"上午时分 \"或 \"日落时分 \"这样的概念外，并不记录一天的时间。如果人们计划在一个特定的时间见面，他们往往会围绕这样的表达方式进行安排。",
	"The concept of hours and minutes exists mainly where wealthy people use clocks, but mechanical clocks are often unreliable, and rarely are two set to the same time. If a local temple or civic structure has a clock that tolls out the passing of the hours, people refer to hours as \"bells,\" as in \"I'll meet you at seven bells.\"": "小时和分钟的概念主要存在于有钱人使用时钟的地方，但机械钟往往不可靠，而且很少有两个钟调到同一时间。如果当地的寺庙或市政建筑有一个钟，可以报出小时的流逝，人们就把小时称为 \"钟\"，如 \"我在七点钟声中与你见面\"。",
	"The worlds of Abeir and Toril drifted apart in 1487 and 1488 DR. In some places this change was accompanied by cataclysm, while in others the shift went without notice. Astronomers and navigators who closely watched the stars couldn't fail to see that there were nights when they seemed to hang in the sky. The winter of 1487-1488 lasted longer than normal. It was then noted that the solstices and equinoxes had somehow shifted, beginning with the spring equinox falling on Greengrass of 1488 DR. The seasons followed suit, with each starting later and ending later. ": "阿拜尔和托里尔的世界在公元1487年和1488年渐行渐远。在一些地方，这种变化伴随着大灾难，而在另一些地方，这种转变没有引起注意。仔细观察星星的天文学家和航海家们不能不看到，有一些夜晚，它们似乎被悬挂在天空中。1487-1488年的冬天持续的时间比正常时间长。然后人们注意到，至点和分点不知为何发生了变化，从公元1488年的春分落在绿草地上开始。季节也紧随其后，每个季节的开始和结束都比较晚。",
	"This shift in seasons has caused some sages, and the priests of Chauntea, to consider changing the marking of some of the annual feast days, but most folk counsel patience, believing that the seasons will fall back to their previous cycle over the coming years. ": "季节的转变使一些圣人和Chauntea的祭司考虑改变一些年度节庆日的标记，但大多数人建议耐心等待，相信季节会在未来几年内恢复到以前的周期。",

	"Much of what follows in this section is known mainly by sages, some of whom have been alive for the last few centuries of Faerûn's history.

	"Tens of thousands of years ago, empires of reptilian, amphibian, and avian peoples—known in Elvish as Iqua'Tel'Quessir, the creator races—dominated the world.

Those were the Days of Thunder.": "数万年前，由爬行动物、两栖动物和鸟类组成的帝国在精灵语中被称为Iqua'Tel'Quessir，即创造者种族，统治着这个世界。他们用石头和玻璃建造伟大的城市，在荒野中开辟道路，驯服伟大的蜥蜴，施展强大的魔法，塑造他们周围的世界，并互相争斗。那是雷霆之日。",
	"The age of the creator races came to a sudden end some thirty thousand years ago. Perhaps their wars reached a terrible and inevitable crescendo, or they tampered with forbidden forces. For whatever reason, the world changed, and their vast empires vanished.

	"Thousands of years after the rise of the great elven nations, hundreds of elf high mages united to cast a spell intended to create a glorious homeland for their race. The spell succeeded, but it rippled backward and forward in time, and the land was sundered, changing the face of the world. The largest continent of this new world is now called Faerûn. Far from its western shores rose the isle of Evermeet, considered a part of Arvandor, the home of the elven gods on the plane of Arborea, and a bridge between worlds.": "在伟大的精灵国家崛起的数千年后，数百名精灵高级法师联合起来施展法术，旨在为他们的种族创造一个光荣的家园。咒语成功了，但它在时间上向后和向前荡漾，土地被分割，改变了世界的面貌。这个新世界中最大的大陆现在被称为Faerûn。在它的西海岸远处升起了Evermeet岛，它被认为是Arvandor的一部分，是Arborea平面上精灵诸神的家园，是世界之间的桥梁。",
	"Some thirteen thousand years ago, war broke out between the elven nations of Aryvandaar and Miyeritar, beginning a series of conflicts known as the Crown Wars.

The high mages of Aryvandaar are blamed for the destruction, although no proof was ever produced.": "大约一万三千年前，精灵国家Aryvandaar和Miyeritar之间爆发了战争，开始了一系列被称为王室战争的冲突。这些冲突持续了大约三千年，在黑暗灾难中达到顶峰，可怕的风暴吞噬了米耶里塔，在一个季节内把它变成了一片荒地，留下了现在被称为高沼泽的地区。Aryvandaar的高级法师被指责为破坏者，尽管没有证据。",
	"The vengeful dark elves of Ilythiir turned to corrupt and demonic powers, unleashing them against Aryvandaar. In the centuries of destruction that followed, elf priests and high mages fervently prayed to Corellon Larethian and the gods of the elven pantheon for salvation.": "伊利蒂尔的复仇的黑暗精灵转向了腐败和恶魔的力量，将它们释放出来对付阿里万达尔。在随后的几个世纪的破坏中，精灵祭司和高级法师热切地向科里隆-拉雷西安和精灵万神殿的诸神祈祷，希望得到拯救。",
	"Corellon interceded in the Crown Wars and cursed the dark elves so that they might never dwell comfortably under the sun.

Wars soon began between the drow and the underground cities of the dwarves.": "科瑞隆在王室战争中出面调停，并诅咒黑暗精灵，让他们永远无法在阳光下舒适地生活。现在发现自己被暴露在日光下的痛苦，乌鸦在短短两个月的时间里就从上面世界的阳光下撤退到了地下世界。他们放弃了对背叛和放逐他们的精灵诸神的所有忠诚，转而将蜘蛛妖后洛尔思作为他们的守护者。鸦人和矮人的地下城市之间的战争很快就开始了。",

	"More than five thousand years ago, a group of human fishing villages on the shores of the Narrow Sea joined under the rule of the shaman-king Nether, becoming known as the empire of Netheril. The Netherese learned the use of magic from the Eaerlanni elves and became renowned wizards. Centuries later, they discovered the arcane texts known as the Nether Scrolls in the ruins of Aryvandaar and subsequently abandoned the practices of the Eaerlanni in order to procure even greater magical power.": "五千多年前，狭海岸边的一群人类渔村在萨满王尼瑟的统治下联合起来，成为著名的尼瑟尔帝国。尼瑟尔人从Eaerlanni精灵那里学会了魔法的使用，并成为著名的巫师。几个世纪后，他们在Aryvandaar的废墟中发现了被称为尼瑟尔卷轴的神秘文本，随后放弃了Eaerlanni的做法，以获得更大的魔法力量。",
	"Netheril grew to become an invincible nation of magic and wonders, dominating much of the North for three thousand years. Then the power-mad Netherese arcanist Karsus attempted to usurp the role of the goddess of magic. The resulting disruption in the fabric of magic sent Netheril's floating cities crashing to the ground, destroyed a host of other wards and enchantments, and brought about the end of the great empire.": "尼瑟尔成长为一个无敌的魔法和奇迹之国，统治北方大部分地区达三千年之久。然后，狂热的尼瑟尔奥术师Karsus试图篡夺魔法女神的地位。由此产生的对魔法结构的破坏使尼瑟尔的浮空城市坠落到地面上，摧毁了大量其他的守护和魔法，并带来了这个伟大帝国的终结。",
	"In the decades and centuries following the collapse of Netheril, many cities of the Sword Coast and the North, such as Illusk and Citadel Sundbarr, took in refugees from the fallen empire, and new settlements made up entirely or primarily of human survivors from Netheril and their descendants were established throughout the North and in the Western Heartlands.": "在尼瑟尔崩溃后的几十年和几个世纪里，剑海岸和北方的许多城市，如伊鲁斯克和桑德巴尔城堡，接纳了来自堕落帝国的难民，在整个北方和西部中心地带建立了完全或主要由尼瑟尔的人类幸存者及其后代组成的新定居点。",
	"Nearly fifteen hundred years ago, the human settlers of the Dalelands and the elves of Cormanthor pledged their alliance in an agreement known as the Dales Compact.

This method of numbering the years in Toril's history has spread across Faerûn and is commonly understood (if not universally accepted).": "近一千五百年前，达利兰的人类定居者和科曼托的精灵在一份被称为 \"达利斯契约 \"的协议中宣誓结盟。一座被称为 \"站立石 \"的纪念碑被竖立起来以示纪念，达勒克宁的出现也被确定下来，从1DR年开始。这种对托里尔历史上的年份进行编号的方法已经传遍了整个法鲁恩，并且被普遍理解（即使不是普遍接受）。",
	"The city of Neverwinter—called Eigersstor when it was a mere settlement—was founded in 87 DR. On the banks of the River Raurin, the humble community of Silverymoon Ford came into being in 384 DR, and less than two centuries later it had grown to become the city of Silverymoon.": "永夜城在87年成立，当时它还只是一个定居点，被称为艾格斯托（Eigersstor）。在劳林河畔，卑微的银月福特社区于384 DR成立，不到两个世纪后，它已经发展成为银月城。",
	"In 882 DR, a village and trading post on the shore of a deep bay in the shadow of a great mountain was named Nimoar's Hold, after the Uthgardt chieftain who claimed the area and fortified it. The place became known to sea captains as \"Waterdeep,\" a name that displaced the original within a few generations. In 1032 DR, Ahghairon, heir to the arts of Netheril, saved the city from itself by unseating Waterdeep's warlord and would-be emperor, Raurlor. Ahghairon declared that wisdom, not strength of arms, would rule in the city from now on, and created the Lords of Waterdeep.": "公元882年，在一座大山阴影下的深湾岸边，有一个村庄和贸易站被命名为 \"尼莫尔之地\"，这是以声称拥有该地区并在此设防的乌斯加特酋长命名的。这个地方被船长们称为 \"沃特德普\"，这个名字在几代人的时间里就取代了原来的名字。公元1032年，Netheril艺术的继承人Ahghairon击败了Waterdeep的军阀和未来的皇帝Raurlor，从而拯救了这座城市的命运。阿格海龙宣布，从现在开始，智慧而非武力将统治这座城市，并创建了沃特德普的领主。",
	"These and other nations and great city-states rose to prominence along the Sword Coast, forming a chain along the Trade Way from Illusk in the far north to Baldur's Gate in the south, near the borders of Amn. Like their elven and dwarven predecessors, they fought off attacks by savage humanoids, including orc hordes from the Spine of the World. Waterdeep, guided by its mysterious Lords, became a rising power, while old Illusk fell to the orcs for decades, until it was eventually reclaimed and the city of Luskan built upon its ruins.": "这些国家和其他国家以及伟大的城邦沿着剑海岸崛起，沿着贸易之路形成了一条链条，从最北边的伊鲁斯克到南边的博德之门，靠近安恩的边界。像他们的精灵和矮人前辈一样，他们抵御了野蛮的人类攻击，包括来自世界之脊的兽人群。沃特迪普在其神秘领主的指引下，成为了一个崛起的大国，而古老的伊拉斯克则在数十年间沦为兽人的天下，直到它最终被收复，并在其废墟上建立了卢斯坎城。",
	"The four and a half centuries since the establishment of the Lords of Waterdeep have been tumultuous times for the Sword Coast and the world. Throughout this period, civilization struggles against the savage forces of chaos, and life attempts to persevere against the agents of death and strife, sometimes in places where even the gods themselves have not been exempt from destruction.": "自沃特德普领主建立以来的四个半世纪，对剑海岸和世界来说都是动荡不安的时代。在这一时期，文明与野蛮的混乱力量进行着斗争，生命试图在死亡和纷争的代理人面前坚持下去，有时在一些地方，甚至连神明本身都无法免于毁灭。",
	"The last one hundred fifty years have comprised one of the most cataclysmic periods in Faerûn's history. On no fewer than three occasions, Toril has been shaken to its core by forces that have repeatedly rewritten the laws of reality.": "过去的150年是法鲁恩历史上最严重的灾难性时期之一。在不少于三次的事件中，托里尔被反复改写现实法则的力量撼动了其核心。",
	"In 1358 DR, the gods were cast out of their otherworldly domain and made to wander the land incarnated as mortals. In seeking to recover their divinity, they warred among themselves. Magic became unpredictable, and the prayers of the faithful went unanswered. Some of the gods-turned-mortal were slain, while a handful of mortals ascended to godhood, assuming the responsibilities of the dead deities.": "公元1358年，众神被赶出了他们的异世界领域，并被迫化身为凡人在陆地上游荡。为了寻求恢复他们的神性，他们之间发生了战争。魔法变得不可预测，而信徒们的祈祷也得不到回应。一些变成了神的人被杀了，而少数凡人则升为神，承担起死去的神的责任。",
	"In 1374 DR, the Empire of Netheril rose again when the floating city of Thultanthar, commonly known as Shade, returned from a nearly two-thousand-year-long excursion in the Shadowfell, to hover above the Anauroch desert. The shadow-touched nobles of the city almost immediately began hunting for ancient Netherese ruins and artifacts and preparing for a restoration of their once-great empire.": "公元1374年，尼瑟尔帝国再次崛起，这时Thultanthar浮空城，俗称Shade，从长达近两千年的暗影城游历回来，盘旋在Anauroch沙漠之上。被阴影触及的城市贵族们几乎立即开始猎取古代尼瑟斯的遗迹和文物，并准备恢复他们曾经的伟大帝国。",
	"In 1385 DR, the ascended deity Cyric, aided by Shar, murdered Mystra, the goddess of magic, in her domain of Dweomerheart. This act ripped asunder the fabric of magic in the world, unleashing its raw power in a catastrophe called the Spellplague. Thousands of practitioners of the Art were driven mad or killed, while the face of Faerûn was reshaped by waves and veils of mystic blue fire. Entire nations were displaced or exchanged with realms from other worlds, and parts of the earth were torn free to float in the air.": "在公元1385年，升天的神灵西里克在沙尔的帮助下，在她的领地Dweomerheart谋杀了魔法女神Mystra。这一行为撕裂了世界上的魔法结构，在一场被称为 \"法术瘟疫 \"的灾难中释放了其原始力量。成千上万的魔法从业者被逼疯或杀死，而法鲁恩的面貌被神秘的蓝色火焰的波浪和面纱所重塑。整个国家被迁移或与其他世界的王国交换，地球的一部分被撕开，漂浮在空中。",
	"A century after the Spellplague, the lands and peoples of Faerûn had become accustomed to the state of things—just in time for everything to change again.": "咒语之灾后的一个世纪，法鲁恩的土地和人民已经习惯了事物的状态--正好赶上一切再次改变。",
	"The first indication of new turmoil came in 1482 DR, when Bhaal, the long-dead god of murder, was reborn in Baldur's Gate amid chaos and bloodshed, leaving two of the city's dukes and many of its citizens dead. The return of Bhaal and his apparent reclamation of the domain of murder from Cyric led some scholars and sages to believe that the rules by which all deities must abide were in flux.": "新的动荡的第一个迹象出现在公元1482年，当时已经死去多年的谋杀之神Bhaal在混乱和血腥中重生在Baldur's Gate，导致该城的两位公爵和许多市民死亡。Bhaal的回归以及他显然从Cyric手中夺回了谋杀领域，导致一些学者和圣人认为，所有神灵必须遵守的规则正在发生变化。",
	"In 1484, strange calamities began to occur throughout Faerûn. An earthquake struck Iriaebor. A plague of locusts afflicted Amn. Droughts gripped the southern lands as the sea steadily receded in places. Amid this tumult, conflict broke out in many regions of the continent. The orcs of Many-Arrows warred against the dwarfholds of the North and their allies. Sembia invaded the Dalelands, and Cormyr raised an army to come to the aid of the Dalesfolk. Netheril brought forces to Cormyr's border, and Cormyr was drawn into a war on both fronts.": "1484年，整个Faerûn开始发生奇怪的灾难。一场地震袭击了Iriaebor。蝗虫之灾困扰着安恩。南方的土地上出现了干旱，海水在一些地方不断地退去。在这种动荡中，大陆的许多地区都爆发了冲突。许多箭头的兽人与北方的矮人家庭及其盟友开战。森比亚（Sembia）入侵达利兰（Dalelands），科米尔（Cormyr）组建了一支军队来援助达利兰人。尼瑟尔（Netheril）将军队带到了科米尔的边境，科米尔被卷入了一场两线作战的战争。",
	"Throughout this period, tales began to spread of individuals who had been touched by the gods and granted strange powers. Some of these so-called Chosen were at the root of the conflicts that grip the land. Some seemed driven by divine purpose, while others claimed to be mystified as to why they would be singled out.": "在整个这一时期，关于被神灵触及并被赋予奇怪力量的人的故事开始传播。这些所谓的神选者中的一些人是困扰这片土地的冲突的根源。有些人似乎是被神圣的目的所驱使，而其他人则声称对他们为什么会被选中感到神秘。",
	"In 1485, in Icewind Dale, the Chosen of Auril foments war with Ten-Towns and was defeated. In Anauroch, seeing that Netherese forces were spread thin, the long-subjugated Bedine people rebelled. Having defeated or besieged the dwarfholds of the North, orcs march on Silverymoon. In Cormyr and Sembia, the Netherese and the Cormyreans traded ground, while the Dalelands became a war zone. As if to offset the drought in the south, in the autumn of 1485 the Great Rain began to fall around the Sea of Fallen Stars and continued unceasingly.": "1485年，在冰风谷，奥里尔的神选者与十方镇挑起战争并被击败。在阿诺罗奇，看到尼瑟斯的部队被分散，长期被奴役的贝丁人反叛了。在击败或围困了北方的矮人家庭后，兽人向银月城进军。在科米尔（Cormyr）和森比亚（Sembia），尼德勒人和科米勒人交换地盘，而达利兰（Dalelands）则成了一个战区。仿佛是为了抵消南方的干旱，1485年秋天，大雨开始在堕星海周围落下，并持续不断。",
	"While the waters rose to the east in early 1486, the tide turned against the orcs in the North, and by the end of the year their armies were broken and scattered. Also during that year, the elves of Myth Drannor came to the aid of the Dalelands and helped push back Sembian forces. On the Sword Coast, the Hosttower of the Arcane rose again in Luskan, along with the Arcane Brotherhood. In Waterdeep and Neverwinter, efforts were made to clear those cities of century-old rubble and neglect. Cormyr repulsed the last of the Sembian and Netherese forces from the nation, reclaiming its territory, and recalled its forces, turning inward to address issues of rebuilding.": "在1486年初水涨船高的同时，北方的兽人也转危为安，到了年底，他们的军队被击溃并分散了。也是在这一年，神话德兰诺（Myth Drannor）的精灵们来到了达利兰（Dalelands）的帮助下，帮助击退了森比亚的军队。在剑海岸，奥术师的主塔和奥术师兄弟会一起在卢斯坎再次崛起。在沃特迪普（Waterdeep）和永夜（Neverwinter），人们努力清除这些城市的百年废墟和荒废。科米尔击退了最后的森比亚和尼瑟斯部队，收回了自己的领土，并召回了自己的部队，转向内部解决重建问题。",
	"Late in 1486, the Great Rain finally abated, but this event didn't signify an end to the chaos. The Sea of Fallen Stars had grown, submerging great swaths of land beneath its waves.": "1486年晚些时候，大雨终于减弱，但这一事件并不意味着混乱的结束。堕星之海不断扩大，将大片土地淹没在其波浪之下。",
	"Early in 1487, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions abounded for months, as if the whole world was convulsing. Rumors spread of chasms caused by the Spellplague suddenly vanishing, and stories circulated of known destinations being farther away from one another, as if the world had quietly added miles of wilderness to the distance between them. Word began to spread of places and peoples not heard from since the Spellplague. It became apparent that some of the effects of that terrible time had been reversed. During the year, ships claiming to be from Evermeet, Lantan, and Nimbral—nations thought vanished or destroyed-sailed into ports on the Sword Coast and in the Shining South. Tales spread of the legendary skyships of Halruaa being spotted in southern skies. No longer engaged in Cormyr, Netheril attacked Myth Drannor by floating the City of Shade over it. In a struggle for control of Myth Drannor's mythal and the Weave itself, the flying capital of Netheril was brought crashing down on Myth Drannor, resulting in the cataclysmic destruction of both.": "1487年初，地震和火山爆发接连发生了几个月，仿佛整个世界都在抽搐。咒语瘟疫造成的裂缝突然消失的传闻也在流传，已知的目的地彼此之间的距离越来越远，仿佛世界悄悄地在它们之间增加了几英里的荒野。自法术瘟疫以来没有听说过的地方和民族的消息开始传播。很明显，那个可怕时期的一些影响已经被逆转。在这一年里，自称来自埃弗米特、兰坦和宁布拉的船只--这些被认为已经消失或被摧毁的国家--驶入了剑海岸和闪耀南方的港口。在南方的天空中发现了传说中的Halruaa天船的故事。Netheril不再参与Cormyr，而是通过在Myth Drannor上空漂浮阴影之城来攻击它。在一场争夺神话德兰诺的神话和编织本身的斗争中，尼瑟尔的飞行首都被撞到了神话德兰诺，导致两者的灾难性毁灭。",
	"As the year drew to a close, there were nights when the heavens seemed to hang motionless. Throughout much of Faerûn, the winter of 1487 and 1488 lasted longer than any on record. The solstices and equinoxes had somehow drifted. Later seasons followed suit, with each starting and ending later than expected. Prayers to the gods for knowledge and mercy seemed to go unacknowledged, apart from the presence of their Chosen.": "当这一年接近尾声时，有几个夜晚，天空似乎一动不动。在Faerûn的大部分地区，1487年和1488年的冬天比任何记录都要长。至点和分点不知不觉地漂移了。后来的季节也是如此，每个季节的开始和结束都比预期的晚。除了神选者的出现，向诸神祈求知识和仁慈的祈祷似乎没有得到承认。",
	"Although the orcs were defeated in the North, the League of Silver Marches was disbanded in 1488, as former allies blamed one another for failures in the war. Sembia divided into separate city-states only nominally allied with one another. While a handful of settlements survived, the Netherese Empire was no more. The remainder of the Netherese forces battle with the Bedine over control of the Memory Spire, thought to be a tomb of the phaerimm, Netheril's ancient enemies. The battle awakens what turns out to be a hive of the creatures, and they use the life and magic-draining power of the spire against the lands below.": "虽然兽人在北方被打败了，但银色马奇联盟在1488年解散了，因为以前的盟友为战争的失败互相指责。森比亚分裂成独立的城邦，只是在名义上相互结盟。虽然有少数定居点幸存下来，但尼德兰帝国已不复存在。剩余的尼瑟斯部队与贝丁人争夺记忆之塔的控制权，该塔被认为是尼瑟斯的古代敌人辉瑞姆的坟墓。这场战斗唤醒了那些被证明是蜂巢的生物，它们利用尖塔的生命和魔法消耗的力量来对付下面的土地。",
	"By 1489, many of the wars that began during the Sundering had ground to a close. Other conflicts arose, and mighty threats still imperiled the world, but the deities ceased interfering with the world through their Chosen. The gods were no longer silent but quiet, and in many places new priesthoods arose to interpret the gods' now subtle signs.": "到了1489年，许多在分裂时期开始的战争已经结束了。其他的冲突出现了，强大的威胁仍然威胁着这个世界，但神灵不再通过他们的神选者干预这个世界了。众神不再沉默而是安静，在许多地方出现了新的神职来解释众神现在微妙的迹象。",
	"The world today seems a place filled with new lands and opportunities, where those who dare can leave their mark. Students of history and those elves and dwarves who recall the past that short-lived humans see as distant perceive a world much like it was over a century ago. For most folk, wild tales of people empowered by the gods, and of far-off lands returned to the world, are the subjects of fireside chatter. Daily concerns and the dangers and opportunities just beyond their doors take precedence, and plenty of both remain on the Sword Coast and in the North.": "今天的世界似乎是一个充满新土地和机会的地方，在那里，那些有胆量的人可以留下他们的印记。研究历史的学生和那些回忆起被短命的人类视为遥远的过去的精灵和矮人，感知到的世界与一个多世纪前的世界很相似。对大多数人来说，被神赋予权力的人的疯狂故事，以及回归世界的遥远土地，是炉边谈话的主题。日常事务以及门外的危险和机会才是最重要的，而在剑海岸和北方，这两方面的问题都很多。",
	"From the simplest cantrip to the mightiest workings of High Magic, from the blessings of healing mercy to the raising of mighty heroes from the dead, magic permeates the Realms. Any understanding of magic begins, and ends, with an understanding of the Weave.": "从最简单的咒语到最强大的高级魔法，从治愈的仁慈的祝福到让强大的英雄起死回生，魔法渗透到了整个王国。对魔法的任何理解都以对 \"编织 \"的理解为起点和终点。",
	"The Weave is an essential element of the universe, running through everything in unseen threads. Some creatures, objects, and locations have deep, intrinsic ties to the Weave and can perform extraordinary feats that come naturally to them (a beholder's flight, a vampire's charming gaze, a dragon's breath weapon, and so forth). Creatures with the necessary talent and skill can also manipulate the Weave to perform magic by casting spells.": "编织是宇宙的一个基本元素，以看不见的线贯穿一切。一些生物、物体和地点与 \"编织 \"有着深厚的内在联系，可以自然而然地完成非凡的壮举（看客的飞行、吸血鬼的迷人目光、龙的呼吸武器，等等）。具有必要天赋和技能的生物也可以通过施法来操纵织网来施展魔法。",
	"The Weave isn't normally visible or detectable, even through the use of spells. Detect magic doesn't let you perceive the Weave, for instance. The Weave isn't magic, precisely, any more than a collection of threads is a garment; it's the raw material from which the tapestry of magic is woven.": "织网通常是不可见的，也无法探测，即使是通过使用法术。例如，探测魔法不能让你感知到 \"编织\"。准确地说，\"编织 \"不是魔法，就像一堆线头是一件衣服一样；它是编织魔法织锦的原材料。",
	"In two senses, both the metaphorical and the real, the goddess Mystra is the Weave. She is its keeper and tender, but all three times the goddess of magic has died or been separated from her divinity (twice as Mystra, and once as her predecessor, Mystryl), magic has been twisted or has failed entirely. With Mystra's last death and the coming of the Spellplague, the Weave was thought destroyed, and the term lost its significance. Since the end of the most recent Sundering, both Mystra and the Weave have returned to their roles of centuries past, and spells and magic items are more reliable than they had been while the Spellplague raged.": "在两种意义上，无论是隐喻的还是现实的，女神Mystra都是织布。她是它的守护者和温柔者，但在这位魔法女神死亡或与她的神性分离的所有三次中（两次作为Mystra，一次作为她的前任Mystryl），魔法都被扭曲或完全失败。随着神秘拉的最后一次死亡和法术瘟疫的到来，编织被认为被摧毁了，这个词也失去了它的意义。自从最近一次混乱结束后，Mystra和 \"织网 \"都回到了他们几个世纪前的角色，法术和魔法物品也比法术瘟疫肆虐时更加可靠。",
	"Certain spells allow casters to perceive or manipulate the effects of the Weave in particular ways. The Weave itself also has irregularities that affect spells.": "某些法术允许施法者以特定的方式感知或操纵织网的效果。织网本身也有影响法术的不规则性。",
	"Detect magic reveals threads of the Weave woven together through spellcasting, or the \"knots\" of the Weave in a magic item. A magic item appears enmeshed in the silvery-blue threads of the Weave, and the way the threads are arranged reveals what type of magic is used (necromancy, abjuration, and so on). Similarly, active spells and areas imbued with magic are limned in a silvery network of threads, which might twist and reknit themselves depending on the magic involved.": "侦测魔法会显示出通过施法编织起来的编织线，或者魔法物品中的编织 \"结\"。一个魔法物品出现在银蓝色的编织线中，编织线的排列方式揭示了使用的是什么类型的魔法（死灵法术、咒语等等）。同样地，活跃的法术和被施以魔法的区域也被限定在银色的线网中，这些线可能会根据所涉及的魔法而扭曲和重新编织起来。",
	"Dispel magic unwinds and prematurely ends magic, unraveling whatever construct of the Weave was put in place.": "驱散魔法会解开并过早地结束魔法，解开编织的任何结构。",
	"Antimagic effects can dispel existing spells and unravel any magic woven from the Weave. Permanent effects, such as those from magic items, are usually suppressed by antimagic: while the effect is within an area of antimagic, the construct of the Weave unravels, but the threads snap back into place once the magic is outside the area.": "反魔法效果可以驱散现有的法术，并解开任何从织网中编织出来的魔法。永久性的效果，例如来自魔法物品的效果，通常会被反魔法抑制：当效果在反魔法的区域内时，编织的结构会解开，但一旦魔法在该区域外，线就会重新回到原位。",
	"In rare areas of dead magic, the Weave is absent. Not only do spells and magic items cease to function, but even the supernatural abilities of creatures that are innately tied to the Weave might fail as the knot of the Weave they carry with them unravels.": "在罕见的死亡魔法区，织网是不存在的。不仅法术和魔法物品会停止运作，甚至那些天生与 \"编织 \"相连的生物的超自然能力也会因为他们携带的 \"编织 \"结的解开而失效。",
	"In an area of wild magic, the Weave becomes \"tangled,\" spontaneously forming its own constructs and resulting magic. It also tends to twist the constructs of the Weave created by spellcasting, causing unexpected results.": "在野生魔法区域，\"编织 \"变得 \"纠结\"，自发地形成自己的构造和产生的魔法。它还倾向于扭曲由咒语创造的编织体的构造，造成意外的结果。",
	"The inborn magical abilities of certain creatures, the acquired supernatural powers of people such as monks, and psionic abilities are similar in that their users don't manipulate the Weave in the customary way that spellcasters do. The mental state of the user is vitally important: monks and some psionics-users train long and hard to attain the right frame of mind, while creatures with supernatural powers have that mind-set in their nature. How these abilities are related to the Weave remains a matter of debate; many students of the arcane believe that the use of the so-called Unseen Art is an aspect of magical talent that can't be directly studied or taught.": "某些生物与生俱来的魔法能力、僧侣等人获得的超自然力量，以及幻术能力都是类似的，因为它们的使用者并不像施法者那样以习惯的方式来操纵编织物。使用者的精神状态是至关重要的：僧侣和一些幻术师为了达到正确的心态而进行了长期而艰苦的训练，而具有超自然力量的生物在本质上就具有这种心态。这些能力与 \"编织 \"的关系如何，仍然是一个争论不休的问题；许多研究奥术的学生认为，使用所谓的 \"看不见的艺术 \"是魔法天赋的一个方面，不能直接研究或教授。",
	"Where a spell effect is brought to life by manipulating the threads of the Weave, the creation of a magic item ties some of those threads together in a specific way, to produce the desired effect for as long as the item lasts. The Weave provides immediately available energy for spells and also enables those who know the craft to harness that energy inside an object until it is called forth by its user (who, of course, need not be a spellcaster).": "咒语效果是通过操纵 \"编织 \"的线来实现的，而魔法物品的创造则是将其中一些线以特定的方式绑在一起，在物品持续的时间内产生所需的效果。编织物为法术提供了立即可用的能量，同时也使那些懂得这门手艺的人能够在物品中利用这些能量，直到使用者（当然，使用者不一定是施法者）召唤它。",
	"In some cases, the magic of an item must be tied to its wielder, representing an entwining of the threads of the Weave between wielder and object known as attunement. As with all matters related to magic, the number of items to which a single being can be attuned is limited, but the benefits of such a relationship can be considerable.": "在某些情况下，一件物品的魔力必须与它的持有者联系在一起，这代表着持有者和物品之间的编织线的缠绕，被称为调和。与所有与魔法有关的事项一样，一个人可以与之调和的物品数量是有限的，但这种关系的好处是巨大的。",
	"mythals are some of the most powerful magic in the world of Toril, constructs that bind and shape the Weave  in a particular location, sometimes so powerfully that the rules of magic or even reality can be bent or rewritten.": "神话是托里尔世界中最强大的魔法，是在特定地点束缚和塑造编织的构造物，有时强大到魔法甚至现实的规则都可以被弯曲或改写。",
	"A mythal is a permanent field of overlapping magical wards and effects tied to a specific location. In its original usage, this term applied to the works of High Magic that protected ancient elven cities. It has since been expanded to cover all manner of similar protections, from the immense floating cities of fallen Netheril to the wards of Silverymoon to the smaller—but no less effective—workings of magic that keep safe important locations like Candlekeep. Even the many-layered wards and effects of Undermountain, beneath Waterdeep, are considered a mythal by some.": "魔法阵是一个由重叠的魔法阵和效果组成的永久性领域，与一个特定的地点相联系。在其最初的用法中，这个术语适用于保护古代精灵城市的高级魔法工程。此后，它被扩展到涵盖所有类似的保护方式，从堕落的尼瑟尔的巨大浮动城市到银月城的防护装置，再到较小但同样有效的魔法工作，以保护像烛台这样的重要地点的安全。即使是水底世界下面的地下山的多层防护和效果，也被一些人认为是一种神话。",
	"Most mythals are defensive in nature, designed to restrict the kinds of magic that can be employed in the area they govern, and the most common restrictions are concerned with teleportation and conjuration magic. Evereska's mythal influences the weather of the area and wards its inhabitants against disease, while the mythal of undersea Myth Nantar makes its waters breathable and more comfortable for creatures not suited to underwater life.": "大多数神话的性质是防御性的，旨在限制在其管辖区域内可以使用的各种魔法，最常见的限制涉及到传送和施法魔法。埃弗里斯卡的神话影响着该地区的天气，并为其居民抵御疾病，而海底神话南塔的神话则使其水域可以呼吸，让不适合水下生活的生物更加舒适。",
	"In many ways, a mythal is less like a spell or a magic item than a living creation of magic, capable of growing stronger or weaker, absorbing damage, or dying. mythals can also sometimes heal themselves, as did the mythal of Silverymoon, blossoming out of the Moonbridge following Mystra's most recent return. Each active mythal has one or more beings attuned to its effects, who can ignore any restrictions on spellcasting, can direct targetable effects of the mythal, and can teach others of appropriate skill how to access its secrets.": "在许多方面，神话并不像一个咒语或魔法物品，而是一个活生生的魔法创造物，能够变强或变弱，吸收伤害或死亡。神话有时也能自愈，就像银月的神话一样，在Mystra最近的回归之后，从月桥上绽放出来。每个活跃的神话都有一个或多个与之相适应的生命，他们可以无视对施法的任何限制，可以引导神话的目标效果，并可以教导具有适当技能的其他人如何获取其秘密。",
	"Except in cities such as Silverymoon and Evereska, adventurers are most likely to encounter damaged or failing mythals in ruined locations where magic once had great influence. Although an identify spell might reveal some of the simplest effects of a mythal, active restrictions on spellcasting can be discovered only by trying (and failing) to cast a prohibited spell. A powerful spellcaster might learn how to access or repair a mythal without assistance, but such feats are legendary, and rarely attempted by even the most renowned of mages. Any elven city with Myth in its title (Myth Drannor, Myth Glaurach, Myth Nantar, and others) has, or had, a mythal protecting it. The ruins of such places are certain to have unpredictable effects related to their damaged or destroyed mythals .": "除了在银月城和埃弗里斯卡这样的城市，冒险者们最有可能在魔法曾经具有巨大影响力的废墟中遇到受损或失效的神话。虽然识别法术可能会揭示神话的一些最简单的效果，但只有通过尝试（和失败）施放禁止的法术，才能发现对施法的主动限制。一个强大的施法者可能会学会如何在没有帮助的情况下进入或修复一个神话，但这种壮举是传奇性的，即使是最著名的法师也很少尝试。任何标题中带有神话的精灵城市（神话德兰诺、神话格劳拉赫、神话南塔等）都有或曾经有一个神话保护着它。这些地方的废墟肯定会有与它们受损或被毁的神话有关的不可预测的影响。",
	"Though wizards work wonders with their Art, and adventurers take their fates into their own hands, it is on the gods that most folk in the Forgotten Realms depend when they have need. The gods play a role in the lives of nearly everyone, from the mightiest lord to the meanest urchin.": "尽管巫师们用他们的艺术创造奇迹，冒险家们将他们的命运掌握在自己手中，但在被遗忘的王国里，大多数人在有需要时都会依赖神灵。诸神几乎在每个人的生活中都发挥着作用，从最强大的领主到最卑微的顽童。",
	"The various races of Toril worship their pantheons, which remain largely the same from region to region, with different cultures and societies emphasizing some deities over others. Although exceptions exist—the gods of Mulhorand, for example—all the gods are revered across all of Faerûn.": "托里尔的各个种族都崇拜他们的万神殿，这些万神殿在各个地区基本保持一致，不同的文化和社会强调一些神灵而不是其他。尽管存在例外--例如穆尔霍兰的神灵--但所有的神灵在整个法鲁恩都受到敬仰。",
	"The average person worships different gods in different contexts. Most vocations have a patron deity: farmers make offerings to Chauntea for the prosperity of their crops, clerks sharpen their quills with a prayer to Deneir, while pious merchants remember to set coins aside for Waukeen at the end of the day. Most people worship a deity associated with their livelihood, family, or home, while others feel called to a particular god for a variety of reasons. Individuals often carry or wear a small token of their favored deity: a pendant or a pin in the image of the god's holy symbol, or some other personal keepsake.": "普通人在不同的环境下崇拜不同的神。大多数职业都有一个守护神：农民为庄稼的繁荣向Chauntea供奉，文员在磨笔时向Deneir祈祷，而虔诚的商人在一天结束时记得为Waukeen留出硬币。大多数人崇拜与他们的生计、家庭或住宅有关的神，而其他人则因各种原因而感到被召唤到某个特定的神。个人经常携带或佩戴他们所钟爱的神灵的小信物：一个吊坠或神灵的神圣标志的徽章，或其他一些个人纪念品。",
	"In addition, people regularly venerate gods based on their needs and circumstances: a farmer whose favored deity is Chauntea would pray to Amaunator for a few clear, sunny days, and a Waterdhavian noble who habitually worships Denier would give thanks to Sune after a successful coming-out party for her son. Even priests of particular gods acknowledge the roles that other deities play in the world and in their lives.": "此外，人们经常根据自己的需要和情况来祭祀神灵：一个以Chauntea为最爱的神灵的农民会向Amaunator祈祷几个晴朗的日子，而一个习惯于崇拜Denier的Waterdhavian贵族会在她儿子的成功出柜派对后向Sune表示感谢。即使是特定神灵的祭司也承认其他神灵在世界和他们的生活中扮演的角色。",
	"In general, worshipers view their relationships with the gods as practical and reciprocal: they pray and make offerings because that is how one invites the blessings of the gods and turns away their wrath. These prayers and other acts of devotion are generally performed quietly at the shrine in one's household or community, or occasionally in a temple dedicated to one's deity, when a worshiper feels the need to \"come knocking upon a god's door\" to ask for attention.": "一般来说，崇拜者认为他们与神灵的关系是实际的和互惠的：他们祈祷和供奉，因为这就是一个人邀请神灵保佑和消除他们愤怒的方式。这些祈祷和其他奉献行为通常是在一个人的家庭或社区的神龛上悄悄进行的，或者偶尔在一个专门为自己的神灵服务的寺庙里进行，当一个崇拜者觉得有必要 \"来敲一个神的门 \"以寻求关注时。",
	"Forms of worship are often acts of veneration: giving thanks for favor shown, making requests for future blessings, and offering praise for the deity's intercessions, large and small. Because most folk in Faerûn don't want to attract the ire of the cruel or savage gods, beseeching them to keep the peace is also an act of worship. A hunter or a farmer might make offerings to Malar in hopes of keeping predators at bay, and a sailor might pray to Umberlee that she withhold her wrath for the duration of a voyage.": "崇拜的形式通常是崇敬的行为：对所表现出的恩惠表示感谢，对未来的祝福提出请求，并对神灵的大大小小的代祷表示赞美。因为法鲁恩的大多数人都不想引起残忍或野蛮的神灵的愤怒，恳求他们保持和平也是一种崇拜行为。猎人或农民可能会向马拉尔献上祭品，希望能阻止捕食者，而水手可能会向翁贝里祈祷，希望她在航行期间不要发怒。",
	"The Faerûnian pantheon isn't the only one known on Toril. Nonhuman races honor their own gods, for example, and people in faraway lands are known to worship altogether different gods. Occasionally, foreigners bring the worship of these gods to Faerûn. In addition, on rare occasions a new god comes into being, perhaps a mortal elevated to godhood or a deity whose arrival was foretold by prophets and leaders of new religions. In cosmopolitan places such as Waterdeep and Calimshan, small shrines and temples to strange gods spring up from time to time.": "法鲁尼神殿并不是托里尔岛上唯一的神殿。例如，非人类种族尊敬他们自己的神，而远方的人们则崇拜完全不同的神。偶尔，外国人会把这些神的崇拜带到法鲁恩。此外，在罕见的情况下，一个新的神灵出现了，也许是一个被提升为神的凡人，或者是一个由先知和新宗教领袖预言的神灵的到来。在沃特迪普和卡林山这样的国际大都市，时常会出现一些小型的神龛和庙宇来供奉奇怪的神灵。",
	"The burgeoning worship of a new deity is rarely a concern to the other gods of the Faerûnian pantheon, and the people who revere those deities, except when the newcomer's area of concern directly competes with that of an established deity. The methods of resolving such conflicts range from friendly dueling festivals or rites meant to emphasize the glory of one god over another, to campaigns of outright religious bloodshed.": "对一个新神的蓬勃崇拜很少会引起法尔尼安神殿中其他神灵的关注，以及对这些神灵的崇敬，除非新加入的神灵的关注领域直接与一个既定神灵的关注领域竞争。解决这种冲突的方法包括友好的决斗节或仪式，旨在强调一个神对另一个神的荣耀，以及彻底的宗教流血运动。",
	"Over generations, a new god might become a settled-in member of the pantheon. Indeed, some scholars posit that Faerûn has many \"immigrant\" gods, who joined the pantheon's ranks so long ago that their foreign origins are lost in antiquity.": "经过几代人的努力，一个新的神可能成为万神殿的固定成员。事实上，一些学者认为法鲁恩有许多 \"移民 \"神，他们很早就加入了万神殿的行列，以至于他们的外国渊源在古代就已经消失了。",
	"Over and over, mourning bells have tolled for some of the deities of the Realms. Gods were struck down during the Time of Troubles, when the Spellplague wrought its destruction, and most recently when Netheril fell. Some deities have even been slain by mortals wielding impossibly powerful magic.": "一次又一次，哀悼的钟声为王国的一些神灵敲响。在动乱时期，当咒语瘟疫造成破坏时，以及最近尼瑟尔陷落时，诸神被击倒。有些神灵甚至被挥舞着强大魔法的凡人所杀。",
	"When a god withdraws from a pantheon, divine magic stops flowing to the faithful, and miracles and omens associated with that god cease, that deity's priesthood loses faith, and holy sites are abandoned or taken over by other faiths. To the deity's worshipers in the world, it is immaterial whether the god is truly dead or merely dormant—the consequences for them are the same either way. Yet, as recent events have borne out, a god who is gone might not remain absent forever. More than a few supposedly dead gods have returned and amassed a new body of worshipers. Indeed, the legends of some gods speak of a cycle of death and resurrection.": "当一个神从万神殿中退出时，神圣的魔法不再流向信徒，与该神有关的奇迹和预兆也停止了，该神的祭司们失去了信仰，圣地被放弃或被其他信仰接管。对于世界上的神灵崇拜者来说，神灵是真的死了还是只是休眠了并不重要--对他们来说，两种情况的后果都是一样的。然而，正如最近的事件所证明的那样，一个已经消失的神可能不会永远不存在。不止几个被认为已经死亡的神灵回来了，并聚集了一批新的崇拜者。事实上，一些神的传说中提到了死亡和复活的循环。",
	"As the Sage of Shadowdale once noted, \"If the gods can grant the power to raise mortals from death, why do ye assume they should be laid low by it forever?\"": "正如影子谷的圣人曾经指出的，\"如果诸神能赋予凡人从死亡中复活的力量，为什么你们认为他们应该永远被死亡所压制？\"",
	"Most humans believe the souls of the recently deceased are spirited away to the Fugue Plane, where they wander the great City of Judgment, often unaware they are dead. The servants of the gods come to collect such souls and, if they are worthy, they are taken to their awaited afterlife in the deity's domain. Occasionally, the faithful are sent back to be reborn into the world to finish work that was left undone.": "大多数人类相信，刚刚去世的人的灵魂会被带到赋格界，在那里他们在伟大的审判之城徘徊，往往不知道自己已经死亡。神的仆人会来收集这些灵魂，如果他们有价值，他们会被带到神的领域中等待来世。偶尔，忠诚的人也会被送回，重生到这个世界，完成未完成的工作。",
	"Souls that are unclaimed by the servants of the gods are judged by Kelemvor, who decides the fate of each one. Some are charged with serving as guides for other lost souls, while others are transformed into squirming larvae and cast into the dust.": "没有被神的仆人认领的灵魂由凯雷莫尔判断，他决定每个人的命运。有些人负责为其他迷失的灵魂提供指导，而其他人则被转化为蠕动的幼虫并被抛入尘土。",
	"Those who serve as priests of a god aren't necessarily clerics. Indeed, the power invested in clerics and other divine spellcasters by the gods is given out only rarely (see \"Divine Magic\" below). The work of a priest is to serve one's deity and that deity's faithful, a task that doesn't necessarily require the use of magic.": "担任某神的祭司的人不一定是神职人员。事实上，诸神赋予牧师和其他神术师的权力只在极少数情况下才会发放（见下文 \"神术\"）。牧师的工作是为自己的神灵和该神灵的信徒服务，这项任务不一定需要使用魔法。",
	"The kind of person attracted to a deity's priesthood depends on the tenets of that god: the cunning rogues who venerate Mask have little in common with the upright law-keepers of Tyr, and the delightful revelers who revere Lliira are different from both.": "一个神的神职吸引什么样的人取决于该神的信条：崇尚马斯克的狡猾流氓与泰尔的正直守法者没有什么共同之处，而崇尚莉莉拉的愉快狂欢者则与两者都不同。",
	"The core religious institutions of Faerûn are temples and shrines. Whether a small, out-of-the-way building, or a complex made up of multiple structures and tracts of land, each temple operates according to the traditions of its faith, although powerful or charismatic figures who rise to prominence within the temple hierarchy might motivate or inspire changes to those traditions.": "法鲁恩的核心宗教机构是寺庙和神殿。无论是偏僻的小建筑，还是由多个建筑和大片土地组成的综合体，每个寺庙都按照其信仰的传统运作，尽管在寺庙等级制度中崛起的强大或有魅力的人物可能会促使或激发对这些传统的改变。",
	"Temples in Faerûn don't have regular services as such. Group observances in a temple occur only at specific festival times, and priests also go out into the community to perform rites such as marriages and funerals. Temples are places where worshipers go either to spend personal or family time in a space consecrated to a deity or to seek the aid of the priests for some reason.": "法鲁恩的寺庙没有定期的服务。寺庙里的集体仪式只在特定的节日里举行，祭司们也会到社区里去举行婚礼和葬礼等仪式。寺庙是崇拜者去的地方，他们或者在一个被献给神灵的空间里度过个人或家庭时光，或者因某种原因寻求祭司的帮助。",
	"Small shrines and private chapels, as distinct from full-fledged temples, are common throughout Faerûn, particularly in areas where a temple doesn't exist. Shrines tend to be unstaffed, kept up by the locals and visitors who use the place for prayer. A shrine might be as modest as a roadside well, where traveling merchants can drop a coin to request good fortune from Waukeen, or as grand as a statue of Amaunator surrounded by braziers in a pavilion in the middle of a village.": "与成熟的寺庙不同，小型神社和私人小教堂在整个法鲁恩很常见，尤其是在没有寺庙的地区。祠堂往往没有工作人员，由当地人和使用该地进行祈祷的游客来维护。神殿可能像路边的水井一样简陋，旅行的商人可以在那里投下一枚硬币向沃肯祈求好运，也可能像村庄中央的亭子里被火炉包围的阿玛努纳特雕像一样宏伟。",
	"Traveling priests often seek out and visit these sites, and they act as meeting places for the faithful. When word gets around that a traveling priest of Eldath has come into town, the faithful seek her out at the holy spring dedicated to the goddess at the edge of town.": "旅行的祭司们经常寻找并访问这些地方，它们是信徒们的聚会场所。当消息传来，一位艾尔达斯的旅行祭司来到了镇上，信徒们就会在镇边献给女神的圣泉中寻找她。",
	"A family or business might maintain a shrine or a chapel to its favored deity, perhaps a set of wind chimes consecrated to Akadi hung from the high branches of a tree in the garden, or a wooden symbol shaped like the hand of Azuth in miniature displayed on a prominent wall with a space nearby to burn a candle or some incense.": "一个家庭或企业可能会给自己喜欢的神灵保留一个神龛或小教堂，也许是在花园里的一棵树的高枝上挂上一套献给阿卡迪的风铃，或者在显眼的墙上挂上一个形似阿苏特之手的微型木制符号，并在附近留出空间烧上蜡烛或一些香火。",
	"Though many tales are told of times past when the gods appeared in physical form and walked the land, occasions of that sort are few and far between. For the most part, the gods communicate with their faithful through signs and omens, appreciated by those able to interpret them. Of course, some signs are more subtle—and thus more open to interpretation—than others.": "虽然有许多关于过去神灵以肉身形式出现并在土地上行走的故事，但这种情况很少，也不多。在大多数情况下，诸神通过征兆和预兆与他们的信徒交流，那些能够解释这些征兆的人对此表示赞赏。当然，有些征兆更微妙，因此更容易被解释。",
	"The most common kind of communion that worshipers and priests find with their deities is in prayer, song, or meditation. Such experiences are intensely personal, and it is common wisdom to keep them that way. After all, \"advice\" from one's god that appears during morning prayer and gives one a good turn to the day is worthwhile only for oneself. Let each worshiper commune in their own way, as the saying goes.": "崇拜者和牧师与他们的神灵最常见的交流是在祈祷、唱歌或冥想中。这种体验是非常个人化的，保持这种体验是一种普遍的智慧。毕竟，在晨祷时出现的来自神的 \"建议\"，给人带来一天的好运气，只对自己有价值。俗话说，让每个崇拜者以他们自己的方式进行交流。",
	"Divine magic also provides a means of communing with the gods and can be used to call upon their guidance. Divine pronouncements of this sort are often personal in scope and brief, and those edicts that concern broader matters tend to be open to interpretation or debate.": "神圣的魔法也提供了一种与众神交流的手段，可以用来召唤他们的指导。这类神谕往往是个人范围的，而且很简短，而那些涉及更广泛事项的法令往往是可以解释或辩论的。",
	"Priesthood is a vocation like any other, with those who undertake it often honing their abilities through a system of apprenticeship. At a small temple, a novice or an acolyte might study under the only priest available. Larger temples can accommodate groups of acolytes, each learning under the direction of one or more mentors responsible for training them in the duties and skills of the priesthood.": "牧师是一种与其他职业一样的天职，从事这一职业的人往往通过学徒制度来磨练自己的能力。在一个小庙里，新手或圣徒可能在唯一的牧师手下学习。较大的寺庙可以容纳成群的圣徒，每个人都在一位或多位导师的指导下学习，负责训练他们的神职职责和技能。",
	"Once acolytes complete their education, they are often ordained in a ritual in which a successful candidate is invested with the responsibilities of the priesthood.": "一旦圣徒完成了他们的教育，他们通常会在一个仪式中被授予圣职，在这个仪式中，成功的候选人被赋予了圣职的责任。",
	"The moral and ethical values of the deities in Faerûn run the gamut, representing all the outlooks that their mortal followers demonstrate, from the principled agents of good to the vicious proponents of evil. Most cultures and societies aren't nearly as cosmopolitan as the population of Faerûn taken as a whole; as a result, religious persecution (from the viewpoint of those who garner the attention) is practiced in places where worship of certain deities is frowned on.": "Faerûn的神灵的道德和伦理价值是不一样的，代表了他们的凡人追随者的所有观点，从有原则的善的代理人到邪恶的支持者。大多数文化和社会并不像法鲁恩的人口那样具有世界性；因此，宗教迫害（从那些获得关注的人的角度来看）是在那些对某些神灵的崇拜不受欢迎的地方实行的。",
	"Most governments that engage in persecution limit such restrictions to the establishment of formal temples, priesthoods, and organized festivals. (On a practical level, it's impossible to prevent individuals from innocuously or secretly worshiping whichever deities they choose.) For instance, although worship of Talona—like that of many evil gods—is forbidden in Waterdeep, this prohibition extends only to the creation of a temple and the presence of her priesthood within the city. Individual citizens or families who revere Talona might be viewed as misguided, but they aren't taken into custody or punished as long as they obey the laws of the city.": "大多数从事迫害的政府将这种限制限制在建立正式的寺庙、祭司职位和有组织的节日上。(在实际层面上，不可能阻止个人无害地或秘密地崇拜他们选择的任何神灵）。例如，尽管在沃特迪普禁止对塔罗娜的崇拜，就像禁止对许多邪神的崇拜一样，但这一禁令只适用于在城市中建立神庙和她的神职人员。崇拜塔罗娜的个别市民或家庭可能会被视为误导，但只要他们遵守城市的法律，就不会被拘留或惩罚。",
	"Some places take this form of persecution a step further, for a variety of reasons. A tyrant might outlaw worship of Torm, lest it inspire rebellion, and an otherwise fair-minded mayor of a river-mill community might demand that worshipers of Silvanus find elsewhere to live because of recent problems the timber-cutters have had with local druids.": "有些地方出于各种原因，将这种迫害的形式更进一步。一个暴君可能会宣布对托尔姆的崇拜为非法，以免引起叛乱，而一个河边磨坊社区的市长可能会要求希尔瓦娜斯的崇拜者到其他地方居住，因为最近伐木工人与当地德鲁伊发生了矛盾。",
	"The gods show their favor toward mortals in myriad ways. A chosen few have their minds and souls opened to the power of magic. There is no formula for who does and doesn't receive this divine insight, as the gods keep their own counsel concerning their selections. Some who are favored seek to ignore or deny their gift, while others embrace it wholeheartedly.": "诸神以无数种方式向凡人示好。被选中的少数人的思想和灵魂被打开，接受魔法的力量。对于谁能得到或不能得到这种神圣的洞察力，没有任何公式，因为众神对他们的选择有自己的看法。一些被选中的人试图忽视或否认他们的天赋，而其他人则全心全意地拥抱它。",
	"Some who display the potential for divine magic develop and practice their abilities in a temple, a sacred grove, or some other spiritual place, perhaps in the company of other students. Other practitioners of divine magic discover and nurture their gods-given power entirely on their own.": "一些显示出神圣魔法潜力的人在寺庙、神圣的小树林或其他灵性场所发展和练习他们的能力，也许还有其他学生陪伴。其他神术修行者则完全靠自己的力量发现和培养神赐的力量。",
	"The gods that make up the pantheon of Faerûn are much like the population of some of the Realms' greatest cities: an eclectic blend of individuals from a variety of sources. The makeup of the pantheon has shifted over the ages, as a result of changes in the Realms and its people (or vice versa, depending on which scholars you believe). The following pages describe the most prominent members of the pantheon.": "构成法鲁恩万神殿的诸神就像一些王国最伟大的城市的人口一样：由来自不同来源的个人组成，不拘一格。万神殿的构成随着时间的推移而变化，这是王国和人民变化的结果（或者相反，取决于你相信哪位学者）。以下几页描述了万神殿中最杰出的成员。",
	"The deities of the Faerûnian pantheon are by no means the only powers worshiped in the Realms. The nonhuman races have pantheons of their own (described in chapter 3), and scattered other cults and local divinities can be found across Faerûn.": "法鲁尼亚万神殿的神灵绝非是王国中唯一被崇拜的力量。非人类种族也有自己的万神殿（见第三章），在法鲁恩各地还可以找到零散的其他宗教和地方神灵。",

	"People of Faerûn refer to Mulhorand as one of the Old Empires, but most don't know that Mulhorand is in fact the oldest human empire still in existence on the continent. Mulhorand's pantheon of deities, sometimes called god-kings or pharaohs, can trace their lineage even farther back.": "法鲁恩的人们把穆尔霍兰德称为古老的帝国之一，但大多数人不知道穆尔霍兰德实际上是大陆上仍然存在的最古老的人类帝国。Mulhorand的万神殿，有时被称为神王或法老，他们的血统甚至可以追溯到更远。",
	"According to the demigods enthroned in Mulhorand, the ancestors of the Mulhorandi people were brought from another world and enslaved by the Imaskari in an ancient empire deep in what is now Raurin, the Dust Desert. When the gods of those ancestors heard the pleas of their distant faithful, they set out in a great celestial ark guided by the entity known as Ptah. Upon arriving in the world, two of the deities, Re and Enlil, set about empowering the slaves and fomenting rebellion.": "根据Mulhorand的半神们的说法，Mulhorandi人的祖先是从另一个世界带来的，并在一个古老的帝国中被Imaskari人奴役，该帝国位于现在的Raurin，即尘土沙漠深处。当那些祖先的神听到他们遥远的信徒的恳求时，他们在被称为普塔的实体的引导下乘坐一艘巨大的天体方舟出发了。到达这个世界后，其中两位神灵，Re和Enlil，开始赋予奴隶权力并煽动叛乱。",
	"The revolt succeeded, but Re and Enlil couldn't keep peace with one another. Each then founded a separate dynasty of divine mortals, Re in Mulhorand, and Enlil (father of Gilgeam) in Unther. Re and his related deities ruled Mulhorand through mortal incarnations for thousands of years.": "叛乱成功了，但Re和Enlil无法保持彼此的和平。于是，他们各自建立了一个独立的神性凡人王朝，Re在Mulhorand，而Enlil（Gilgeam的父亲）在Unther。Re和他的相关神灵通过凡人的化身统治了Mulhorand，长达数千年之久。",
	"Time took its toll, and the attention the deities of Mulhorand paid to their followers wavered and diminished. Each new incarnation of Isis, Osiris, and Thoth was a little more human and a little less divine. When the magically powerful Imaskari returned with a vengeance a little over a century ago, they stole the scepter of rulership from a grasp so weak it barely had any strength left.": "随着时间的推移，穆尔霍兰德的神灵们对他们的追随者的关注也在动摇和减弱。伊希斯、奥西里斯和托斯的每一个新化身都多了几分人性，少了几分神性。一个多世纪前，当魔法强大的伊马斯卡里人报复性地回来时，他们把统治权杖从一个软弱得几乎没有任何力量的手中偷走了。",
	"Although Mulhorand's conquerors outlawed slavery in the area they now called High Imaskar, the Mulhorandi people recognized the yoke they now bore. The Imaskari were the new coming of the slavemasters of old, as depicted in the carvings in the pharaohs' tombs. Many prayed that the vanished gods would return and once again free them from Imaskari rule, and during the Sundering, that is what happened. What were referred to as Chosen in other lands were recognized in Mulhorand as living gods, come to lead the Mulhorandi in an uprising.": "尽管穆尔霍兰的征服者在他们现在称为高伊马斯卡的地区取缔了奴隶制，但穆尔霍兰迪人认识到他们现在背负的枷锁。伊马斯卡利人是古老的奴隶主的新来者，正如法老墓穴中的雕刻所描绘的那样。许多人祈祷消失的神灵会回来，再次将他们从伊马斯卡利的统治中解放出来，而在分裂时期，这就是发生的事情。在其他地方被称为神选者的东西在穆尔霍兰被认为是活的神，来领导穆尔霍兰迪人的起义。",
	"Today Mulhorand is ruled by demigods that call themselves by such names as Re, Anhur, Horus, Isis, Nephthys, Set, and Thoth. They take different forms, some human and others tieflings or aasimar, but all speak and act like the gods of legend come to life, which they must be. This family of deities bears the scars of all the past loves, rivalries, and wars between them, but for now they have set their differences aside for the betterment of Mulhorand and its people, and the people of Mulhorand love them for it.": "今天，Mulhorand由半神统治，他们自称为Re、Anhur、Horus、Isis、Nephthys、Set和Thoth等名字。他们采取不同的形式，有些是人类，有些是盗贼或阿西玛人，但他们的言行举止都像传说中的神灵，他们一定是这样。这个神灵家族背负着过去所有的爱情、竞争和战争的伤痕，但现在他们为了穆尔霍兰德和它的人民更好地发展而把他们的分歧放在一边，穆尔霍兰德的人民也因此而爱他们。",
	"the keeper of the eternal sun, the light of law, the yellow god": "永恒的太阳的守护者，法律之光，黄色的上帝",
	"The rule of law and the glory of the sun are both in Amaunator's dominion. His priests help establish bureaucracies and lawful order in communities. They often witness contracts and signed agreements, stamping such documents with the sun-symbol of Amaunator to signify their validity.": "法治和太阳的光辉都在Amaunator的统治之下。他的祭司帮助建立官僚机构和社区的合法秩序。他们经常见证合同和签署的协议，在这些文件上盖上阿玛努纳特的太阳符号，以表示其有效性。",
	"His priests teach that Amaunator has died and been reborn time and again. Like the sun, he might pass into the realm of darkness, but inevitably his bright gaze will fall on the world once again. Amaunator is seen as a stern and unforgiving deity, not unlike Silvanus in comportment, but his concern isn't for the balance of life—he cares that things proceed according to the celestial order, that promises are kept, and that the rule of law persists.": "他的牧师们教导说，阿玛努纳特已经死了，并且一次又一次地重生了。就像太阳一样，他可能会进入黑暗的领域，但不可避免的是，他明亮的目光会再次落在这个世界上。阿玛努纳特被看作是一个严厉而无情的神，在行为举止上与希尔瓦努斯并无二致，但他关心的不是生命的平衡--他关心的是事情是否按照天体秩序进行，承诺是否兑现，以及法治是否持续。",
	"Farmers and travelers beseech him when they pray for rain or sun, as do any others looking for a favorable change in the weather. But the most common form of propitiation to Amaunator is the practice of swearing oaths, signing contracts, and declaring laws under the light of the sun. So ingrained in the common perception is the connection between a solemn oath and the sun that those engaged in closing deals or issuing edicts often pause and wait for a passing cloud to clear the sun before completing the transaction or pronouncement.": "农民和旅行者在祈求雨水或太阳时都会向他祈求，就像任何其他寻求有利天气变化的人一样。但最常见的祭祀阿玛努特的形式是在太阳光下宣誓、签署合同和宣布法律的做法。庄严的誓言和太阳之间的联系在普通人的观念中是如此根深蒂固，以至于那些从事交易或发布法令的人经常暂停，等待过往的云彩将太阳照亮，然后完成交易或宣布。",
	"the lord of the ninth, the cloven, old hoof and horn": "九头鸟的主人，驽马的主人，古老的蹄子和角的主人",
	"In the beliefs of the people of the North—which coincide with many tales told by dwarves, elves, and others—Asmodeus is Lord of the Ninth, the leader of all devils of the Nine Hells. People know devils to be iron-minded and silver-tongued purveyors of temptation, whose price for their boons can be as dear as one's soul. It's said that when a soul waits on the Fugue Plane for a deity to take it to its appropriate afterlife, devils approach the soul and offer it a chance at power and immortal pleasures. All a soul needs to do is take one step out of the dust and the milling crowd and put a foot on the first rung of the infernal ladder that represents the hierarchy of the Nine Hells.": "在北方人的信仰中--这与矮人、精灵和其他人讲述的许多故事相吻合--阿斯摩德是九世之主，是九层地狱所有魔鬼的领袖。人们知道魔鬼是铁石心肠和银牙利齿的诱惑传播者，他们的好处的价格可以和人的灵魂一样珍贵。据说，当一个灵魂在赋格平面上等待神灵把它带到适当的来世时，魔鬼就会接近这个灵魂，给它一个获得权力和不朽快乐的机会。灵魂所需要做的就是走出尘埃和熙熙攘攘的人群，踏上代表九层地狱等级制度的地狱阶梯的第一层。",
	"The faithful of Asmodeus acknowledge that devils offer their worshipers a path that's not for everyone—just as eternally basking in the light of Lathander or endlessly swinging a hammer in the mines of Moradin might not be for everyone. Those who serve Asmodeus in life hope to be summoned out of the moaning masses of the Fugue Plane after death. They yearn for the chance to master their own fates, with all of eternity to achieve their goals.": "阿斯莫德的信徒们承认，魔鬼为他们的崇拜者提供了一条道路，但这并不适合每一个人，就像永远沐浴在拉坦德的光芒下，或者在莫拉丁的矿场里无休止地挥舞锤子，可能并不适合每一个人。那些生前为阿斯莫德服务的人希望死后能被从赋格平面的呻吟人群中召唤出来。他们渴望有机会掌握自己的命运，用所有的永恒来实现他们的目标。",
	"To those not so dedicated, priests of Asmodeus offer the prospect of a reprieve in the afterlife. All souls wait on the Fugue Plane for a deity's pleasure, which determines where a soul will spend the rest of eternity. Those who lived their lives most in keeping with a deity's outlook are taken first. Others, who have transgressed in the eyes of their favored god or have not followed any particular ethos, might wait centuries before Kelemvor judges where they go. People who fear such a fate can pray to Asmodeus, his priests say, and in return a devil will grant a waiting soul some comfort.": "对于那些不那么虔诚的人，阿斯莫德的祭司们提供了在来世得到缓和的前景。所有的灵魂都在赋格平面上等待神灵的喜悦，这决定了一个灵魂将在哪里度过余下的永恒岁月。那些生活中最符合神灵观点的人首先被带走。其他人，如果在他们所喜爱的神的眼中犯了错，或者没有遵循任何特定的道德规范，可能会在凯勒莫尔判断他们的去向之前等待几个世纪。害怕这种命运的人可以向阿斯莫德（Asmodeus）祈祷，他的牧师说，作为回报，一个魔鬼会给等待的灵魂一些安慰。",
	"Today, shrines to Asmodeus are still rare and temples are almost unheard of, but many folk have adopted the habit of asking Asmodeus for reprieve from their sins. After transgressing against a god in some way, a person prays to Asmodeus for something to provide respite during the long wait. Asmodeus is known to grant people what they wish, and thus people pray for all the delights and distractions they desire most from life. Those who transgress in great ways often ask Asmodeus to hide their sins from the gods, and priests say that he will do so, but with a price after death.": "今天，阿斯莫德的神龛仍很罕见，寺庙也几乎闻所未闻，但许多人都养成了向阿斯莫德请求赦免罪过的习惯。在以某种方式触犯了某位神灵之后，人们会向阿斯莫德祈祷，希望在漫长的等待中得到喘息的机会。众所周知，阿斯莫德会满足人们的愿望，因此人们祈求他们在生活中最渴望的所有乐趣和分心。那些犯了大错的人经常要求阿斯莫德向诸神隐瞒他们的罪过，祭司们说他会这样做，但死后要付出代价。",
	"the frostmaiden, lady frostkiss, icedawn": "霜女, 霜吻女士, 冰晨",
	"Auril, the merciless goddess of cold and winter, is worshiped mostly in regions that are affected by deep winters. Folk propitiate Auril with offerings and prayers for mercy. Her priests warn others to prepare for winter, and to stock extra provisions in order to have some to spare as offerings to the goddess.": "寒冷和冬季的无情女神奥里尔（Auril），主要在受深冬影响的地区被崇拜。民间用祭品和祈祷来祈求奥里尔的怜悯。她的祭司们警告其他人要为冬天做好准备，并储存额外的食物，以便有一些剩余的食物作为对女神的供奉。",
	"Few favor Auril except for those who make their livelihood from winter or those who truly love the season. Her rare priests tend to be folk who would, but for their status, likely be outcasts from their communities. They practice celibacy and remain aloof from others when not serving in their official capacity.": "除了那些以冬季为生的人或真正热爱这个季节的人之外，很少有人喜欢Auril。她罕见的牧师往往是那些如果不是因为他们的身份，很可能会被社区抛弃的人。他们实行独身主义，在不以官方身份服务时，对其他人保持冷漠。",
	"Luskan has a temple dedicated to Auril, the whitespired Winter Palace. The structure is a roofless array of pillars and arches carved of white stone. The rituals of Auril's worship often seem cruel to outsiders. In Luskan, visitors gather at the temple to watch the frequent \"wet parades,\" a ritual in which supplicants don garments packed with ice. They then journey between six white pillars known as the Kisses of Auril, which are dispersed throughout the city. The worshipers move from pillar to pillar, chanting prayers to the goddess. Upon reaching a pillar, a supplicant must climb it and then \"kiss the lady,\" touching lips to a rusty iron plate at the top. In winter, these events resemble frantic footraces, with the added risk of frostbite and injuries caused by falling from the slippery pillars. The parade runners are cheered on by patrons who come out of nearby taverns to place bets on the stamina of the participants. Those who finish the race are thought to have helped make the winter easier, and they rarely have to pay for food or ale all winter long.": "卢斯坎有一座供奉奥里尔的神庙，即白描的冬宫。该结构是一个由白色石头雕刻的柱子和拱门组成的无屋顶阵列。在外人看来，奥里尔的崇拜仪式往往是残酷的。在卢斯坎，游客们聚集在寺庙，观看频繁的 \"湿身游行\"，在这种仪式中，祈求者穿上装满冰块的衣服。然后他们在被称为 \"奥里尔之吻 \"的六根白色柱子之间穿梭，这些柱子分散在整个城市。崇拜者从一个柱子到另一个柱子，向女神诵读祈祷文。到达一个柱子后，祈求者必须爬上柱子，然后 \"亲吻女士\"，将嘴唇接触到柱子顶端的一块生锈的铁板。在冬天，这些活动类似于疯狂的赛跑，同时还有冻伤和从湿滑的柱子上摔下来受伤的风险。游行者受到附近酒馆的顾客的欢呼，他们在参与者的耐力上下注。那些完成比赛的人被认为是帮助了这个冬天，他们在整个冬天很少需要支付食物或酒水。",
	"the high one, the lord of spellcraft, the first magister": "高高在上的法术之神，第一个魔法师",
	"Few pay homage to Azuth aside from wizards. For them, the High One is the ultimate embodiment of all that they hold dear.": "除了巫师之外，很少有人向阿苏特致敬。对他们来说，\"高人 \"是他们所珍视的一切的最终化身。",
	"Mystra serves as goddess of magic; Oghma is god of knowledge; and Deneir is god of writing and language. Azuth takes aspects of these general fields and applies them to the specific practices of wizards. For instance, while Mystra is the deity who represents the soul, art, and wonder of magic, Azuth is god of a wizard's long hours of study, exacting standards of movement and speech, and cramped, ink-stained fingers. Wizards invoke Azuth when they scribe scrolls, inscribe magic circles, attempt to memorize spells, and even when they cast spells. Often this acknowledgment comes in the form of silently forming Azuth's holy symbol, pointing the index finger of the left hand to the sky. For many wizards, the gesture is so commonplace in their lives that it becomes an unconscious habit.": "米斯特拉是魔法女神；奥格玛是知识之神；迪内尔是写作和语言之神。阿苏斯从这些一般领域中抽取一些方面，并将其应用于巫师的具体实践。例如，Mystra是代表魔法的灵魂、艺术和奇迹的神，而Azuth则是巫师长时间学习、严格的动作和语言标准以及抽筋、沾满墨水的手指的神。巫师们在书写卷轴、刻画魔法阵、尝试记忆法术，甚至在施展法术时都会召唤阿苏特。这种承认往往是以默默地形成阿祖思的神圣符号的形式出现，将左手的食指指向天空。对许多巫师来说，这个手势在他们的生活中是如此常见，以至于成为一种无意识的习惯。",
	"Temples dedicated to Azuth are scarce, and clerics of the deity are extremely rare. Even in magic-saturated Halruaa, only a handful of holy places are dedicated to Azuth. Sometimes a statue or a shrine dedicated to him stands in a corner of a temple to Mystra or another deity. More often, a wizard has a personal shrine at home. Azuth is represented at such sites as a hooded and bearded figure with left hand held high, finger pointed up. Sometimes he is represented by merely the hand. In either case, the finger often serves as a candleholder or as the point of origin for a light spell.": "献给阿苏特的寺庙很少，神职人员也极为罕见。即使在魔法盛行的哈尔鲁阿，也只有少数几个圣地供奉着阿苏特。有时，在供奉Mystra或其他神灵的寺庙的一个角落里，会有一个供奉他的雕像或神龛。更常见的是，巫师在家里有一个个人神龛。在这些地方，阿苏斯被表现为一个戴着头巾、留着胡子的形象，左手高举，手指向上。有时他只用手来代表。在这两种情况下，手指经常作为烛台或作为光明咒语的起源点。",
	"the black hand, the lord of darkness": "黑手，黑暗的主宰者",
	"Bane has a simple ethos: the strong have not just the right but the duty to rule over the weak. A tyrant who is able to seize power must do so, for not only does the tyrant benefit, but so do those under the tyrant's rule. When a ruler succumbs to decadence, corruption, or decrepitude, a stronger and more suitable ruler will rise.": "班恩有一个简单的道德观：强者不仅有权利而且有义务统治弱者。能够夺取权力的暴君必须这样做，因为不仅暴君受益，在暴君统治下的人也会受益。当一个统治者屈服于颓废、腐败或堕落时，一个更强大、更合适的统治者将崛起。",
	"Bane is vilified in many legends. Throughout history, those who favor him have committed dark deeds in his name, but most people don't worship Bane out of malice. Bane represents ambition and control, and those who have the former but lack the latter pray to him to give them strength. It is said that Bane favors those who exhibit drive and courage, and that he aids those who seek to become conquerors, carving kingdoms from the wilderness, and bringing order to the lawless.": "班恩在许多传说中都被诋毁。纵观历史，那些偏爱他的人以他的名义做出了黑暗的行为，但大多数人并不是出于恶意而崇拜贝恩。班恩代表着野心和控制，那些拥有前者但缺乏后者的人向他祈祷，希望他能给他们力量。据说贝恩偏爱那些表现出魄力和勇气的人，他帮助那些寻求成为征服者的人，从荒野中雕刻出王国，并为无法无天的人带来秩序。",
	"At many times and in many places in Faerûn, the faithful of Bane have been seen as saviors for their efforts in slaughtering raiders, throwing down corrupt rulers, or saving armies on the brink of defeat. But in just as many other places, the worship of Bane has created or supported cruel dictatorships, aided mercantile monopolies, or brought about the practice of slavery where before it didn't exist.": "在Faerûn的许多时候和许多地方，Bane的信徒被视为救世主，因为他们努力屠杀突袭者，推翻腐败的统治者，或拯救濒临失败的军队。但在其他许多地方，对贝恩的崇拜也创造或支持了残酷的独裁统治，帮助了商业垄断，或在以前不存在的地方带来了奴隶制的做法。",
	"the maid of misfortune, lady doom, black bess": "不幸的女仆，厄运女士，黑贝斯",
	"Beshaba is the counterpoint to Tymora and is just as frequently acknowledged in daily life as is her more benevolent \"sister.\" She is seen as a cruel and capricious goddess who must be propitiated to avoid attracting her attention and interest in a negative way.": "贝沙巴是泰莫拉的对立面，在日常生活中与她更仁慈的 \"妹妹 \"一样经常被承认。她被看作是一个残酷而任性的女神，必须对她进行祭祀，以避免以消极的方式吸引她的注意和兴趣。",
	"Beshaba's name is invoked when someone is beset by bad luck—which could be as minor as stubbing a toe or breaking a wagon wheel, or as catastrophic as slipping and accidentally falling off a cliff. It is also invoked to ward off her attentions when someone is doing something in which good luck wouldn't play a part but bad luck might. For example, someone rolling dice would invoke Tymora because they want random chance to fall in their favor, but someone about to cross a rickety bridge would ask Beshaba to keep the bridge intact.": "Beshaba的名字在某人被厄运困扰时被引用--厄运可能是小事，如戳到脚趾或弄坏马车车轮，也可能是灾难性的，如滑倒并意外地掉下悬崖。当有人在做一些好运不会影响到他，但坏运气可能会影响到他的事情时，也会引用它来抵御她的注意。例如，有人在掷骰子时会召唤泰莫拉，因为他们希望随机的机会对他们有利，但有人要过一座摇摇欲坠的桥时会请求贝沙巴保持桥的完整。",
	"Folk make the symbol of Beshaba by folding in their thumbs and extending their fingers on one or both hands (mimicking the horns of her holy symbol) to ward off misfortune. The same gesture raised to the head signifies a salute; when pointed at someone, the \"horns\" indicate ill favor directed toward that individual.": "民间用大拇指折叠，伸出一只手或两只手的手指（模仿她的神圣标志的角）来做贝沙巴的象征，以抵御不幸。同样的手势举到头上表示敬礼；当指向某人时，\"角 \"表示对该人的不友好。",
	"Many druids worship Beshaba as one of the First Circle. They propitiate her with dances while wearing fire-blackened antlers dipped in blood. According to these druids, her holy symbol is the horns of a stag because when Beshaba was first worshiped, humans were simple hunter-gatherers and she was believed to bring misfortune to hunters, such as being gored by a stag.": "许多德鲁伊将贝沙巴作为第一圈的一员加以崇拜。他们戴着蘸了血的火黑鹿角，用舞蹈来祭祀她。根据这些德鲁伊的说法，她的神圣象征是雄鹿的角，因为在贝沙巴最初被崇拜时，人类是简单的狩猎采集者，她被认为会给猎人带来不幸，比如被雄鹿咬伤。",
	"Although most people tremble in fear at the prospect of Beshaba's attendance at any event (even in spirit), Beshaba is almost always invoked and welcomed formally in the opening speeches or ceremonies of formal functions such as marriages and coronations, contests of sport or martial prowess, and at the naming ceremonies of children. If she isn't invited to such an event, she might take offense and wreak misfortune on those involved.": "尽管大多数人对Beshaba出席任何活动（即使是精神上的）的前景感到恐惧，但Beshaba几乎总是在正式活动的开幕词或仪式上被援引并受到正式欢迎，如婚姻和加冕仪式、体育或武术比赛，以及儿童的命名仪式。如果她没有被邀请参加这样的活动，她可能会生气，并对有关人员造成不幸。",
	"Temples to Beshaba are virtually unknown. It's common, however, for rural folk to erect a post and mount antlers on it at the site of some roadside accident or murder. In cities, where antlers are hard to come by and murders and accidents more prevalent, the fashion is to draw the black antlers of Beshaba with charcoal on a nearby wall, leaving the symbol on display until weather scours it away. These \"shrines,\" in either form, serve as warnings to others about places of ill fortune.": "祭祀贝沙巴的庙宇几乎不存在。然而，农村人在路边发生事故或谋杀的地方竖起一根柱子，并在上面挂上鹿角，这很常见。在城市里，鹿角很难买到，谋杀和事故也更多，时尚的做法是在附近的墙上用木炭画出贝沙巴的黑色鹿角，让这个符号一直展示着，直到天气把它刮走。这些 \"神龛\"，无论是哪种形式，都是对他人的警告，提醒他们注意不吉利的地方。",
	"More formal shrines to Beshaba exist in places where folk frequently hope to ward off misfortune. These sites tend to be posts or stones painted red with blackened antlers attached to them, or a red, triangular wallmounted plaque with attached antlers. Both types have a stone or bronze bowl where coins can be tossed or burnt offerings made. The Red Wizards of Thay commonly erect such shrines outside their ritual chambers to guard against unfortunate mistakes.": "在民间经常希望抵御不幸的地方，有更正式的贝沙巴神龛。这些地方往往是涂成红色的柱子或石头，上面挂着发黑的鹿角，或者是一个红色的、挂在墙上的三角形牌子，上面挂着鹿角。这两种类型都有一个石碗或铜碗，可以投掷硬币或进行焚烧供奉。泰伊的红袍巫师们通常在他们的仪式室外竖起这样的神龛，以防止不幸的错误。",
	"Few dare to take Beshaba as a patron. The rare clerics of the Maid of Misfortune are those who have been deeply affected by great misfortunes and who seek to warn others of the essential unfairness of life—or to inflict that unfairness upon them.": "很少有人敢把贝沙巴作为赞助人。罕见的 \"不幸女仆 \"教士是那些深受巨大不幸影响的人，他们试图警告他人生活的本质不公平--或者将这种不公平施加于他们。",
	"the lord of murder": "谋杀案的主宰者",
	"The folk of Faerûn don't normally pray to or acknowledge Bhaal. He is seen as a deeply evil and destructive deity who hungers for death—meaning the death of any sentient beings through unlawful means.": "法鲁恩的居民通常不向巴尔祈祷或承认他。他被认为是一个极其邪恶和具有破坏性的神灵，他渴望死亡--指的是通过非法手段使任何有生命的人死亡。",
	"Some people pray to Bhaal when they want to commit murder. A person might have good reason to resort to murder, such as when one is unable to redress some injustice through lawful means. But it's far more common for prayers to Bhaal to be uttered by those who seek to kill someone out of jealousy, greed, or wrath. It's rare for anyone but assassins or compulsive killers to take Bhaal as a patron, and clerics who revere Bhaal often qualify on both counts.": "有些人在想杀人的时候会向Bhaal祈祷。一个人可能有充分的理由诉诸于谋杀，比如当一个人无法通过合法手段纠正某些不公正的行为时。但那些因嫉妒、贪婪或愤怒而想杀人的人对巴哈的祈祷则更为常见。除了刺客或强迫性杀手之外，很少有人会把巴哈勒当做守护神，而崇尚巴哈勒的神职人员往往在这两方面都符合条件。",
	"Murder cults of Bhaal have arisen in the past, each led by a charismatic, self-styled priest of Bhaal, but organized worship of the Lord of Murder is extremely uncommon. Temples and shrines are similarly rare. Those who erect a shrine to Bhaal usually do so to thank him for a successful murder. Such shrines typically feature a skull or a severed head surrounded by drops of blood (often both from the murdered victim).": "过去曾出现过对巴哈的谋杀崇拜，每个人都由一个有魅力的、自称是巴哈的牧师领导，但对谋杀之主的有组织的崇拜是极其不常见的。寺庙和神龛也同样罕见。那些为巴尔建立神龛的人通常是为了感谢他的成功谋杀。这类神龛通常以头骨或断头为特色，周围有血滴（通常都是被害人的血滴）。",
	"the great mother, the grain goddess": "伟大的母亲，粮食女神",
	"Chauntea is goddess of agriculture: sowing and reaping, seeding and harvest, breeding and butchery, shearing and weaving. In this aspect she is a rural deity rarely prayed to behind the walls of a city except by kitchen gardeners. But Chauntea is also the Great Mother, a goddess of crib, hearth, and home. And as such she is welcomed into all homes at mealtimes and at the birth of children, and folk give her thanks whenever they experience the pleasure of settling by a fire and feeling safe and loved.": "Chauntea是农业女神：播种和收割，播种和收获，繁殖和屠宰，剪羊毛和织布。在这方面，她是一位农村的神，除了厨房里的园丁，很少有人在城市的围墙后面向她祈祷。但Chauntea也是伟大的母亲，是摇篮、炉灶和家庭的女神。因此，她在吃饭时和孩子出生时被欢迎到所有的家庭，而且每当人们体验到在火堆旁定居并感到安全和被爱的乐趣时，就会向她表示感谢。",
	"Chauntea's faith is one of nurturing and growth. Agricultural aphorisms and farming parables dot her teachings. Growing and reaping, the eternal cycle, is a common theme in the faith. Destruction for its own sake, or leveling without rebuilding, is anathema to her.": "Chauntea的信仰是养育和成长。农业箴言和农耕寓言点缀着她的教义。成长和收获，永恒的循环，是信仰中的一个共同主题。为破坏而破坏，或只铲除而不重建，对她来说是一种诅咒。",
	"Temples of Chauntea maintain a great body of lore about farming and cultivation. Her priests work closely with communities in rural areas, and they are willing to roll up their sleeves and dig their hands into the dirt.": "Chauntea的寺庙保留了大量关于农耕和种植的传说。她的牧师与农村地区的社区密切合作，他们愿意卷起袖子，把手伸进土里。",
	"The druids of the Moonshae Isles worship the Earthmother, she who is the generative power of the land itself. To some mainlanders, the Earthmother is an aspect or manifestation of Chauntea, but to the Ffolk, she is simply the Earthmother, and always will be. The moonwells of the isles are her sacred sites and her windows onto the world. See \"Druids\" in chapter 4 for more information.": "月海群岛的德鲁伊们崇拜地母，她是土地本身的生成力量。对一些大陆人来说，地母是Chauntea的一个方面或表现，但对Ffolk来说，她只是地母，而且永远是。岛屿上的月井是她的圣地，是她通向世界的窗口。更多信息见第4章的 \"德鲁伊\"。",
	"the prince of lies, the dark sun": "谎言的王子，黑暗的太阳",
	"The worship of Cyric derives directly from the story of his ascension to godhood. Cyric was a mortal during the Time of Troubles and the key to how that chaotic period resolved, but he was also a selfish traitor and a murderer. When he became a god, Cyric continued to work various plots of deceit and murder—the most famous of which is that, according to legend, Cyric murdered Mystra and thus caused the Spellplague over a century ago.": "对居里的崇拜直接来源于他升天成神的故事。西里克是动乱时期的一个凡人，是那个混乱时期如何解决的关键，但他也是一个自私的叛徒和杀人犯。当他成为神后，赛里克继续实施各种欺骗和谋杀的阴谋--其中最著名的是，根据传说，赛里克在一个多世纪前谋杀了Mystra，从而引发了法术之灾。",
	"Those who don't worship Cyric see him as a god of madness, strife, and deceit, although his priests consider such claims to be heresy. Their Prince of Lies isn't a twisted madman, but a god of dark majesty who proves that, ultimately, all bonds between folk corrupt and wither away.": "那些不崇拜Cyric的人认为他是一个疯狂、争斗和欺骗的神，尽管他的牧师认为这种说法是异端。他们的谎言王子并不是一个扭曲的疯子，而是一个黑暗的威严之神，他证明了，最终，民间的所有纽带都会腐烂和凋零。",
	"Cyric's church works openly in Amn, where the citizens espouse the principles of ambition, self-reliance, and \"buyer beware.\" Those who take Cyric as their patron tend to be sadists, con artists, power-mad connivers, and worse. Other folk pray to Cyric when they want to do wrong but don't want others to find out about it.": "西里奇的教会在安恩公开运作，那里的公民崇尚野心、自力更生和 \"买家要小心 \"的原则。那些以赛里克为守护神的人往往是虐待狂、骗子、权力狂的骗子，甚至更糟。另一些人在想做坏事但又不想让别人发现时，会向西里克祈祷。",
	"\"The Dark Sun,\" originally one of Cyric's epithets, has become a metaphor for strife in the Realms. \"A Dark Sun has risen o'er this court\" might be spoken as a warning that intrigues and infighting have gotten out of hand in a noble household; and married couples know to seek advice from others if \"a Dark Sun shines through the window\" in their relationship.": "\"黑暗的太阳\"，最初是西里奇的外号之一，现在已经成为王国纷争的隐喻。\"黑暗的太阳在这个宫廷里升起 \"可能被说成是一个警告，即阴谋和内讧在一个贵族家庭中已经失控；已婚夫妇知道，如果在他们的关系中出现 \"黑暗的太阳照进了窗户\"，就要向别人寻求建议。",
	"the lord of all glyphs and images, the first scribe, the scribe of oghma": "所有字形和图像的主宰，第一个抄写员，Oghma的抄写员",
	"Deneir is the god of literature and literacy, the patron of the artist and the scribe. His is the power to accurately render and describe, to write and to read, and to pass on information. In legend, Deneir is often portrayed as being a scribe in service to Oghma, and he is sometimes thought of as Oghma's right hand.": "德尼尔是文学和识字之神，是艺术家和抄写员的守护者。他有能力准确地呈现和描述、书写和阅读，并传递信息。在传说中，Deneir经常被描绘成为Oghma服务的抄写员，他有时被认为是Oghma的右手。",
	"It's common practice for someone who writes a letter or records information to say a prayer to Deneir to avoid mistakes. Similarly, artists acknowledge Deneir before beginning and upon completing paintings, particularly illuminations on manuscripts, tapestries that relate stories, and any such attempt to use art to capture the truth.": "写信或记录信息的人通常会向Deneir祈祷以避免错误。同样，艺术家们在开始和完成绘画之前，特别是在手稿上的插图、与故事有关的挂毯以及任何此类试图用艺术来捕捉真相的作品时，都会向Deneir致意。",
	"Followers of Deneir believe that information not recorded and saved for later use is information lost. They consider literacy an important gift of the gods, one that should be spread and taught. His followers are scribes and scholars devoted, like their patron, to preserving written works, and also to experiencing them, for they say that Deneir himself is hidden within the lines, shapes, and passages of all written works. Priests of Deneir take an oath of charity as well, compelling them to accept the requests of others to write letters and transcribe information.": "德涅尔的追随者认为，没有记录和保存以供日后使用的信息就是丢失的信息。他们认为识字是诸神的重要礼物，应该被传播和传授。他的追随者是文士和学者，像他们的守护者一样，致力于保存书面作品，同时也致力于体验它们，因为他们说迪内尔本人隐藏在所有书面作品的线条、形状和段落中。Deneir的祭司们也会发下慈善的誓言，迫使他们接受他人的请求，写下信件和抄写信息。",
	"The god's followers tend to be individualists, united by their shared faith but not overly concerned with religious hierarchy and protocol. This behavior is supported by the fact that Deneir's blessings of divine magic are more often bestowed on those who lose themselves in written works than on those who fancy themselves part of any temple or religious order. Contemplation of the faith's most holy book, the Tome of Universal Harmony, is the most effective way to become deserving of Deneir's blessings.": "神的追随者往往是个人主义者，他们因共同的信仰而团结在一起，但对宗教等级和礼节并不过分关注。这种行为得到了以下事实的支持：德内尔的神圣魔法祝福更多的是赐予那些在文字作品中迷失自我的人，而不是那些自诩为任何神庙或宗教秩序的人。思考信仰中最神圣的书--《宇宙和谐之书》，是成为值得Deneir祝福的最有效方式。",
	"the quiet one, the guardian of groves, the mother of the waters": "宁静者，树林的守护者，水的母亲",
	"Eldath is the goddess of waterfalls, springs, pools, stillness, peace, and quiet glades. She is thought to be present at many such places, particularly those that serve as druid groves. Eldath is a goddess of comfort, healing, and calm. Her blessed waters heal the sick, cure madness, and comfort the dying.": "埃尔达斯是瀑布、泉水、水池、静止、和平和安静的小树林的女神。她被认为存在于许多这样的地方，特别是那些作为德鲁伊丛林的地方。埃尔达斯是一位舒适、治愈和平静的女神。她的祝福之水可以治愈病人，治愈疯狂，并安慰垂死的人。",
	"Most rural places have a pond or a glade that locals ascribe to Eldath. Tradition dictates that it be a place of quiet reflection where others are left to their thoughts. A body of water such as a pond or a spring typically serves as a repository of offerings. If the holy site is a glade, a stream one crosses along the way might serve as the repository, or a prominent bush or tree in the glade might be the place where people tie offerings. Typical offerings are broken weapons or items that are remembrances of arguments, which the faithful discard while making a wish for peace in the future. Many of those who favor Eldath are pacifists or people who are troubled by violence they have witnessed or experienced.": "大多数农村地区都有一个池塘或一个小树林，当地人把它归于埃尔德斯。传统上，它是一个安静思考的地方，其他人可以在那里进行思考。池塘或泉水等水体通常作为祭品的存放地。如果圣地是一片沼泽地，人们沿途经过的一条小溪可能会成为存放地，或者沼泽地中突出的灌木或树木可能是人们系上祭品的地方。典型的祭品是破损的武器或纪念争吵的物品，信徒们将其丢弃，同时许下未来和平的愿望。许多赞成Eldath的人都是和平主义者，或被他们所目睹或经历的暴力所困扰的人。",
	"Eldath's priests don't organize into large sects. Indeed, many are itinerant, wandering between various holy sites and shrines, seeing that the locations are cared for and that they remain places of sweet serenity. The faithful of Eldath are usually close to nature, and allied to druids, who count Eldath among the First Circle. It is taboo to strike a priest of Eldath, and killing one is said to bring great misfortune. Despite the measure of protection that this belief affords them, most priests of Eldath avoid conflicts rather than attempting to quell them. Those who serve Eldath are happy to preside over peaceful negotiations and to certify treaties, but they can't force others to engage in harmony.": "艾尔达斯的祭司们并没有组织成大的教派。事实上，很多人都是流动的，在各个圣地和神殿之间游荡，确保这些地方得到照顾，并保持甜蜜的宁静。艾尔达斯的信徒通常亲近自然，并与德鲁伊结盟，他们把艾尔达斯视为第一圈。打击艾尔达斯的牧师是一种禁忌，杀死一个牧师据说会带来巨大的不幸。尽管这种信仰为他们提供了一定程度的保护，但大多数艾尔达斯的牧师会避免冲突，而不是试图平息冲突。那些为艾尔达斯服务的人很乐意主持和平谈判并证明条约，但他们不能强迫他人参与和谐。",
	"the wonderbringer, the inspiration divine, the holy maker of all things": "神奇的使者，神圣的灵感，神圣的万物缔造者",
	"Gond is the god of artifice, craft, and construction. He is revered by blacksmiths, woodworkers, engineers, and inventors. Anyone who is crafting something might say a prayer to Gond to guide the work, but folk know that Gond smiles most brightly upon new inventions that others find useful.": "贡德是工匠、工艺和建筑之神。他受到铁匠、木匠、工程师和发明家的敬仰。任何正在制作东西的人都可能向冈德祈祷，以指导工作，但人们知道，冈德对别人认为有用的新发明笑得最灿烂。",
	"Priests of Gond wander the North dressed in saffron vestments, adorned with sashes that contain within their folds gears, locks, hooks, and bits of steel, tin, and wood that might prove useful in a pinch. They also wear belts of large, linked metal medallions and enormous sun hats. A traveling priest of Gond offers services to distant villages as a tinker, a carpenter, and a civil engineer rolled into one, ready to help build a better paddock gate, dig a new well, or mend pots or furniture that might otherwise go to waste. All priests of Gond keep journals in which they record ideas, inventions, and innovations discovered in their travels, and take great delight in meeting fellow priests and sharing their finds. In large cities, the Gondar construct temples that serve as great workshops and inventors' labs. Wandering priests turn their journals over to the resident scribes at such temples, who then record the priests' observations for posterity and the benefit of all.": "贡德的祭司们穿着藏红花法衣在北方游荡，装饰着腰带，腰带的褶皱里有齿轮、锁、钩子，以及在紧要关头可能证明有用的钢、锡和木头碎片。他们还戴着由大的、连在一起的金属奖章组成的腰带和巨大的太阳帽。贡德的旅行牧师向远方的村庄提供服务，就像一个工匠、一个木匠和一个土木工程师，随时准备帮助建造一个更好的围场门，挖一口新井，或者修补可能被浪费的锅或家具。贡德的所有牧师都会写日记，记录他们在旅行中发现的想法、发明和创新，并非常乐意与其他牧师会面，分享他们的发现。在大城市里，刚德人建造的寺庙是伟大的工作室和发明家的实验室。漂泊的祭司将他们的日记交给这些寺庙的常驻抄写员，然后他们将祭司们的观察记录下来，供后人参考，使所有人受益。",
	"Most who favor Gond practice time-honored crafting professions: they are smiths and engineers, architects and weavers, leatherworkers and jewelers. Even so, this faith has a well-earned reputation as a haven for crackpot inventors and visionaries.": "大多数支持贡德的人从事历史悠久的手工艺职业：他们是铁匠和工程师、建筑师和织工、皮革工和珠宝工。即便如此，这种信仰也有一个得来不易的声誉，那就是疯狂的发明家和幻想家的天堂。",
	"The center of Gond's worship on the Sword Coast lies in Baldur's Gate, where the faithful have erected two huge structures in honor of the Wonderbringer: a temple called the High House of Wonders and a museum of craft and design called the Hall of Wonders. Lantan had been the preeminent place of Gond's worship in the world until a century ago, when the island nation disappeared, and since its return the few Lantanese merchants seen in Sword Coast ports have said little about the present state of their homeland.": "冈德崇拜在剑海岸的中心位于博德之门，信徒们在那里建立了两座巨大的建筑来纪念神奇使者：一座名为奇迹高屋的神庙和一座名为奇迹大厅的工艺和设计博物馆。兰坦岛一直是贡德在世界上最重要的崇拜场所，直到一个世纪前，这个岛国消失了，自从它回来后，在剑海岸港口看到的少数兰坦商人对他们祖国的现状几乎只字不提。",
	"the mouth of mielikki, the master tracker, the tracker never led astray": "Mielikki之口，追踪大师，从未误入歧途的追踪者",
	"Few aside from rangers of the North pray to Gwaeron Windstrom. Said to have been a mortal man elevated to godhood by Mielikki, Gwaeron serves rangers as their intercessor with Mielikki. He is seen as a master ranger, the perfect tracker, a peerless animal handler, and a dedicated foe of rapacious creatures such as trolls and orcs. He is said to look like an old man with a long white beard who is still hale and mighty, and he is believed to take rest and sleep in a stand of trees near Triboar.": "除了北方的游骑兵外，很少有人向格瓦隆-温德斯特伦祈祷。据说格瓦隆是被米利基提升为神的凡人，他作为游骑兵与米利基的中间人为他们服务。他被视为一个游侠大师，完美的追踪者，无以伦比的动物管理人，以及巨魔和兽人等贪婪生物的忠实敌人。据说他看起来像一个长着白色胡须的老人，但仍然精神矍铄，据说他在特里波尔附近的树丛中休息和睡觉。",
	"Rangers pray to Gwaeron because he represents much of the work they do, and because he can speak to Mielikki on their behalf. In the North, most rangers view Mielikki as too mysterious, holy, and wild to be addressed directly with their requests, but they consider Gwaeron Windstrom to be one of them and thus understanding of their needs.": "游骑兵们向格瓦隆祈祷，因为他代表了他们所做的大部分工作，也因为他能代表他们向米利基说话。在北方，大多数游骑兵认为Mielikki太过神秘、神圣和野性，无法直接向他们提出要求，但他们认为Gwaeron Windstrom是他们中的一员，因此理解他们的需求。",
	"Gwaeron has no temples, but shrines dedicated to him can be found in many places that serve wilderness wanderers as trail markers. Each one is denoted by a carving of Gwaeron's symbol, a paw print with a star on the palm, on a prominent tree or stone.": "格瓦隆没有寺庙，但在许多地方都能找到供奉他的神龛，作为荒野流浪者的足迹标志。每一个神龛都有一个格瓦隆的标志，即在一棵突出的树或石头上雕刻一个手掌上有一颗星的爪印，以此来表示。",
	"the watcher, he of the unsleeping eyes, the vigilant one": "观察者，不眠的眼睛，警惕的人",
	"The god of vigilance and protection, Helm is seen as the epitome of the guardian, the watcher, and the guard. He is venerated by those who need to remain watchful for enemies or danger. Helm is a favorite deity of people who make a living by protecting someone or something, such as bodyguards, members of the city watch, and the guards of a treasury vault.": "赫尔姆是警戒和保护之神，被视为守护者、观察者和卫士的缩影。他被那些需要对敌人或危险保持警惕的人所敬仰。赫尔姆是那些以保护某人或某物为生的人最喜欢的神，如保镖、城市守望者和金库的守卫。",
	"Helm embodies the spirit of watchfulness without regard to good or evil. In legends, he is honorable and keeps his word to a fault, such as when he guarded the celestial stairways during the Time of Troubles, preventing the gods from ascending them and continuing the chaos of that period, until the Tablets of Fate were found.": "赫尔姆体现了不分善恶的守望精神。在传说中，他是可敬的，并在一定程度上遵守自己的诺言，比如在动乱时期，他守护着天梯，阻止众神登上天梯，延续了那个时期的混乱局面，直到找到命运之片。",
	"Although his faith has known dark days, worship of Helm never truly faded away. Most of his followers believe that the Watcher can never be vanquished utterly, and recent events have borne out that assertion.": "虽然他的信仰经历了黑暗的日子，但对赫尔姆的崇拜从未真正消退。他的大多数追随者认为，守望者永远不可能被彻底征服，最近的事件也证明了这一说法。",
	"Helm's priests teach that one must be ever vigilant, ever aware, ever prepared for one's enemies. Patience, clear thought, and careful planning will always defeat rushed actions in the end. Those who favor Helm strive to be alert, clear-headed, and true to their word. These traits don't necessarily make them nice people, however, and as such many consider the faithful of Helm to be inflexible and merciless.": "赫尔姆的牧师们教导说，人必须时刻保持警惕，时刻注意，时刻为自己的敌人做好准备。耐心、清晰的思考和周密的计划最终总能打败仓促的行动。赞成赫尔姆的人努力做到警觉、头脑清晰、言行一致。然而，这些特征并不一定使他们成为好人，因此，许多人认为赫尔姆的信徒是不灵活的、无情的。",
	"the doombringer, poet of justice": "末日使者，正义的诗人",
	"Hoar, known in the lands along the Inner Sea as Assuran, is a god of revenge and retribution. He isn't typically worshiped habitually, but his name is invoked by those who seek vengeance. When a guilty party falls prey to fate—such as when a murderer escapes prosecution, but is then accidentally slain himself—the hand of Hoar is given credit. When one hears three rolls of thunder in succession, it is thought to be a sign from Hoar that some act of vengeance has been performed. Many human societies have the custom of ringing a bell or a gong three times when judgment of a crime is rendered or an execution takes place.": "胡尔，在内海沿岸的土地上被称为阿苏兰，是一个复仇和报应之神。他通常不会被习惯性地崇拜，但他的名字会被那些寻求复仇的人所引用。当有罪的一方成为命运的猎物时--例如，当一个杀人犯逃脱了起诉，但自己却意外地被杀死时，胡尔的手就会被归功。当人们连续听到三声雷鸣时，人们认为这是胡尔的征兆，表明某种复仇行为已经完成。许多人类社会都有这样的习俗，即在对某一罪行作出判决或执行死刑时，敲响钟或锣三次。",
	"Folk speak Hoar's name when they want revenge, particularly when they are incapable of avenging themselves. This invocation might be in response to a petty slight or a true injustice, and the acknowledgment of Hoar might be a short prayer said aloud or might be written down somewhere. It's generally believed that the more permanent the form of the prayer, the more likely it is to be fulfilled. For this reason, some etch their prayers in lead and bury it or hide their prayers inside diaries. Aside from bounty hunters and those on crusades of vengeance, few truly revere Hoar, and he is served by fewer still who would call themselves priests. Temples or shrines of Hoar are almost nonexistent except for ancient sites in Chessenta and Unther.": "当人们想要报仇的时候，特别是当他们没有能力报仇的时候，就会说出胡尔的名字。这种召唤可能是为了回应一个小的轻视或真正的不公正，对胡尔的承认可能是一个简短的祈祷，大声说出来或可能写在某个地方。人们普遍认为，祈祷的形式越是永久，就越有可能实现。出于这个原因，有些人把他们的祈祷词刻在铅上并埋起来，或者把他们的祈祷词藏在日记本里。除了赏金猎人和那些复仇的十字军，很少有人真正崇敬霍尔，而自称是牧师的人就更少。除了Chessenta和Unther的古老遗址外，霍尔的寺庙或神龛几乎不存在。",
	"Hoar became a member of the Faerûnian pantheon when his worship extended beyond the lands that originally revered him. Most consider Tyr to be the arbiter of laws, and Hoar to be the god who metes out punishment that comes as a result of breaking those codes. A judge might favor the worship of Tyr, while a jailor or a headsman is more likely to pray to Hoar.": "当胡尔成为法鲁尼亚万神殿的一员时，他的崇拜已经超出了最初敬仰他的土地。大多数人认为泰尔是法律的仲裁者，而胡尔则是对违反这些法规的人进行惩罚的神。法官可能倾向于崇拜泰尔，而狱卒或头人则更倾向于向胡尔祈祷。",
	"the crying god, the rack-broken lord, he who endures": "哭泣的神，断裂的主，忍耐的人",
	"Ilmater is the god of suffering, martyrdom, and perseverance, renowned for his compassion and endurance. It is he who offers succor and calming words to those who are in pain, victimized, or in great need. He is the willing sufferer, the one who takes the place of another to heft the other's burden, to take the other's pain. He is the god of the oppressed and the unjustly treated.": "伊尔马特是苦难、殉道和坚忍之神，因其慈悲和忍耐而闻名。他为那些处于痛苦、受害或极度需要的人提供救助和安抚的话语。他是心甘情愿的受难者，是代替他人承担他人的负担，承受他人的痛苦的人。他是被压迫者和被不公正对待者的神。",
	"It is said that if he had his way, the Crying God would take all the suffering in the world onto himself, so as to spare others. Since he can't, he blesses those who endure on others' behalf, and he alleviates suffering when he can. Martyrs who die that others may live are always blessed by Ilmater with a final rest and reward in the god's afterlife, should they so choose.": "据说，如果他有办法的话，哭神会把世界上所有的苦难都揽到自己身上，这样就可以免除别人的痛苦。既然他不能这样做，他就祝福那些为他人忍受痛苦的人，并且在他能做到的时候减轻痛苦。为他人生存而牺牲的殉道者总是受到伊尔马特的祝福，在神的来世得到最后的休息和奖赏，如果他们选择这样做的话。",
	"Ilmater's priests take in the ill, the starving, and the injured, and his temples give most of what they receive to help offset the suffering of the world. His followers provide succor when they can, but also use force to put an end to torture and suffering inflicted on others. Ilmater's priests travel to places where the worst possible conditions exist, ministering to the needs of the oppressed, the deceased, and the poor. They put others ahead of themselves, are sharing of all they have, and emphasize the spiritual nature of life over the welfare of the material body.": "伊尔马特的牧师收留病人、饥饿者和受伤者，他的寺庙将他们收到的大部分东西用于帮助抵消世界的痛苦。他的追随者在可能的情况下提供救助，但也使用武力来结束对他人的折磨和痛苦。伊尔马特的牧师们前往条件最恶劣的地方，为受压迫者、死者和穷人的需要提供服务。他们把别人放在自己前面，分享他们所拥有的一切，并强调生命的精神本质而不是物质身体的福利。",
	"Priests of Ilmater who are on a quest to aid others can be recognized by their hair shirts, vests of coarse fur worn against the bare skin. It is taboo to harm such priests as they go about their duties, such as when they administer to the wounded on a battlefield. The taboo is so strongly felt among humans that other races respect the custom. Even orcs and goblinoids will avoid directly attacking a peaceful priest of Ilmater, as long as the priest administers to their fallen warriors as well.": "伊尔马特的祭司们在执行援助他人的任务时，可以通过他们的毛衣来识别，毛衣是用粗糙的毛皮穿在裸露的皮肤上的背心。伤害这些牧师是禁忌，因为他们在履行职责时，例如在战场上对伤员进行治疗。这种禁忌在人类中是如此强烈，以至于其他种族也尊重这种习俗。即使是兽人和地精也会避免直接攻击和平的伊尔马特祭司，只要该祭司也为他们死去的战士进行治疗。",
	"Most folk deeply respect the work and the sacrifice of Ilmater's faith, and lend aid to such endeavors where they can. When a temple of Ilmater sends its faithful to help refugees of war or victims of plague, their willingness to sacrifice their own well-being always prompts ordinary people to support them, whether they are inspired or shamed into action.": "大多数人对伊尔马特信仰的工作和牺牲深表敬意，并在力所能及的范围内为这种努力提供援助。当伊尔马特的寺庙派其信徒去帮助战争难民或瘟疫受害者时，他们愿意牺牲自己的福祉，总是促使普通人支持他们，无论他们是受到鼓舞还是被羞辱而采取行动。",

	"Legend has it that Jergal is an ancient deity. The story goes that in the time of Netheril he was worshiped as the god of death, murder, and strife. Yet with the passing of time, he became bored with his position. Then one day three mortals, each a powerful adventurer, met Jergal in the lands of the dead, determined to destroy him and take his power. Instead, Jergal calmly abdicated his throne of bones and allowed each of the three mortals to take part of his divinity. Thus it was that Bane assumed the portfolio of strife, Myrkul the rulership of the dead, and Bhaal the portfolio of murder. Jergal lost his former stature and became a scribe of the dead.": "传说Jergal是一个古老的神灵。故事说，在尼瑟尔时代，他被当作死亡、谋杀和争斗之神来崇拜。然而随着时间的流逝，他对自己的地位感到厌烦。然后有一天，三个凡人，每一个都是强大的冒险家，在亡灵之地遇到了杰格尔，决心摧毁他，夺取他的权力。相反，杰格尔平静地放弃了他的白骨王座，并允许这三个凡人中的每个人都能获得他的一部分神性。就这样，贝恩承担了争斗的职责，米尔库尔承担了亡灵的统治权，而巴尔则承担了谋杀的职责。耶格尔失去了他以前的地位，成了亡灵的抄写员。",
	"Jergal is now seen as an uncaring custodian of the dead. He is thought to record the passing of the living and to aid Kelemvor in seeing that souls are properly bound to their appropriate afterlife. He is rarely acknowledged directly, except for being mentioned at funerals and among those who practice the custom of writing the name of the deceased on a sheet of parchment and placing it in the corpse's mouth. This rite is common in places where an individual's grave or tomb isn't marked with the person's name.": "Jergal现在被看作是一个无情的死者监护人。他被认为是记录生者的逝去，并帮助凯勒莫尔看到灵魂被适当地束缚在他们适当的来世。他很少被直接承认，除了在葬礼上被提及，以及在那些实行将死者的名字写在羊皮纸上并放入尸体口中的习俗的人中。这种仪式在个人的坟墓或墓穴没有标明个人姓名的地方很常见。",
	"Few people favor Jergal as a deity, and most who do are concerned with the dispensation of the dead in some way. Priests of Jergal serve communities as undertakers and caretakers of gravesites. Jergal has no temples dedicated to him aside from abandoned places devoted to his old, darker incarnation, but his priests are welcome in the temples of Kelemvor, Deneir, and Myrkul. His faithful send their annual recordings of mortality to holy sites where records of that sort are kept.": "很少有人把耶加勒当作神灵，而大多数人都以某种方式关注死者的分配问题。杰尔加的祭司们作为殡仪馆和墓地的看护人为社区服务。除了专门供奉他的古老而黑暗的化身的废弃场所外，杰加尔没有专门供奉他的庙宇，但他的祭司在凯勒莫、迪内尔和米尔库尔的庙宇中受到欢迎。他的信徒们每年都会把他们的死亡记录送到保存有此类记录的圣地。",
	"Long ago there was but one god of strife, death, and the dead, and he was known as Jergal, Lord of the End of Everything. Jergal fomented and fed on the discord among mortals and deific entities alike. When beings slew each other in their quest for power or in their hatred, he welcomed them into his shadowy kingdom of eternal gloom. As all things died, everything came to him eventually, and over time he built a kingdom unchallenged by any other god. But he grew tired of his duties, for he knew them too well, and without challenge there is nothing—and in nothingness there is only gloom. In such a state, the difference between absolute power and absolute powerlessness is undetectable.": "很久以前，只有一个掌管纷争、死亡和亡灵的神，他被称为 \"Jergal\"，万物之灵。杰格尔在凡人和神灵之间煽动和滋生不和。当众生为了追求权力或仇恨而互相残杀时，他欢迎他们进入他那阴暗的永恒的黑暗王国。随着万物的消亡，一切最终都归于他，随着时间的推移，他建立了一个没有任何其他神灵可以挑战的王国。但他逐渐厌倦了他的职责，因为他太了解这些职责了，没有挑战就没有一切--在虚无中只有阴暗。在这种状态下，绝对的权力和绝对的无权之间的区别是无法察觉的。",
	"During this dark era arose three powerful mortals—Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul—who lusted after the power Jergal possessed. The trio forged an unholy pact that they would gain such ultimate power or die in the attempt. Over the length and breadth of the world they strode, seeking powerful magic and spells and defying death at every turn. No matter what monster they confronted or what spells they braved, the three mortals emerged unscathed at every turn. Eventually, the trio journeyed into the Gray Waste and sought out the Castle of Bone. Through armies of skeletons, legions of zombies, hordes of wraiths, and a gauntlet of liches they battled. Eventually they reached the object of their lifelong quest—the Bone Throne.": "在这个黑暗的时代，出现了三个强大的凡人--贝恩（Bane）、巴尔（Bhaal）和米尔库尔（Myrkul），他们渴望获得杰格尔拥有的力量。这三个人订立了一个不神圣的协议，他们将获得这种终极力量，否则就会死在这里。他们走遍了世界的各个角落，寻求强大的魔法和法术，并处处不畏死亡。无论他们面对的是什么怪物，也无论他们面对的是什么法术，这三个凡人每次都毫发无伤。最终，三人进入灰色荒原，寻找骨之城堡。他们在骷髅大军、僵尸军团、成群结队的巫师和地衣的包围中战斗。最终，他们到达了他们毕生追求的目标--白骨王座。",
	"\"I claim this throne of evil,\" Bane the tyrant shouted to Jergal.": "\"我要求这个邪恶的宝座，\"暴君班恩对杰格尔喊道。",
	"\"I'll destroy you before you can raise a finger,\" threatened Bhaal the assassin.": "\"我会在你举起手指之前摧毁你，\"刺客巴尔威胁道。",
	"\"And I shall imprison your essence for eternity,\" promised Myrkul the necromancer.": "\"而我将永远囚禁你的精华，\"死灵法师米尔库尔承诺。",
	"Jergal arose from his throne with a weary expression and said, \"The throne is yours. I have grown weary of this empty power. Take it if you wish—l promise to serve and guide you as your seneschal until you grow comfortable with the position.\" Then, before the stunned trio could react, the Lord of the Dead asked, \"Who among you shall rule?\"": "耶哥从他的宝座上站起来，露出疲惫的表情，说：\"宝座是你的。我已经对这种空洞的权力感到厌倦了。如果你愿意，就拿去吧，我保证作为你的参谋为你服务并指导你，直到你对这个位置感到舒服为止。\" 然后，在目瞪口呆的三人做出反应之前，亡灵之主问道：\"你们中谁将统治？\"",
	"The trio immediately fell to fighting among themselves while Jergal looked on with indifference. When eventually it appeared that either they would all die of exhaustion or battle on for an eternity, the Lord of the End of Everything intervened.": "这三个人立即陷入了彼此之间的争斗，而杰格尔则冷眼旁观。当最终看来，要么他们都会因疲惫而死，要么就会永远战斗下去时，万物终结之主进行了干预。",
	"\"After all you have sacrificed, would you come away with nothing? Why don't you divide the portfolios of the office by engaging in a game of skill for them?\" asked Jergal.": "\"在你们牺牲了那么多之后，你们会一无所获吗？你为什么不通过为他们搞一场技巧游戏来划分办公室的投资组合呢？\"耶格尔问。",
	"Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul considered the god's offer and agreed to it. So Jergal took the skulls of his three most powerful liches and gave them to the trio so they could compete in skull bowling. Each mortal rolled a skull across the Gray Waste, having agreed that the winner would be he who bowled the farthest.": "班恩、巴尔和米尔库尔考虑了神的提议并同意了。于是，杰格尔把他的三个最强大的地衣的头骨给了他们三人，这样他们就可以在头骨保龄球比赛中一决高下。每个凡人都将一个头骨滚过灰色荒原，并约定谁打得最远谁就是赢家。",
	"Malar the Beastlord arrived to visit Jergal at this moment. After quickly ascertaining that the winner of the contest would receive all of Jergal's power, he chased off after the three skulls to make sure that the contest would be halted until he had a chance to participate for part of the prize. Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul again fell to fighting, as it was obvious their sport had been ruined, but again Jergal intervened. \"Why don't you allow Lady Luck to decide, so you don't have to share with the Beast?\"": "兽王马拉尔这时赶来拜访杰尔格。在迅速确定比赛的获胜者将获得杰格尔的全部力量后，他追着那三个骷髅头走了，以确保比赛停止，直到他有机会参与其中以获得部分奖励。贝恩、巴哈尔和米尔库尔再次陷入争斗，因为很明显他们的运动已经被破坏了，但杰尔格再次进行干预。\"你为什么不让幸运女神来决定，这样你就不用和野兽分享了？\"",
	"The trio agreed to this alternative, and Jergal broke off his skeletal finger bones and gave them to the contestants. When Malar returned from chasing the skulls, he found that the trio had just finished a game of knucklebones.": "三人组同意了这个备选方案，杰格尔掰下自己的骷髅指骨，送给了参赛者。当马拉尔追赶骷髅头回来时，发现三人组刚刚结束了一场指骨游戏。",
	"Bane cried out triumphantly, \"As winner, I choose to rule for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant. I can induce hatred and strife at my whim, and all will bow down before me while in my kingdom.\"": "班恩胜利地喊道：\"作为胜利者，我选择作为最终的暴君来统治所有的永恒。我可以随心所欲地诱发仇恨和纷争，在我的王国里，所有人都会在我面前俯首称臣。\"",
	"Myrkul, who had won second place, declared, \"But I choose the dead, and by doing so I truly win, because all that you are lord over, Bane, will eventually be mine. All things must die—even gods.\"": "赢得第二名的米尔库尔宣布：\"但我选择了死人，这样做我就真正赢了，因为你所主宰的一切，贝恩，最终将是我的。所有的东西都必须死，即使是神。\"",
	"Bhaal, who finished third, proclaimed, \"I choose death, and it is by my hand that all that you rule, Lord Bane, will eventually pass to Lord Myrkul. Both of you must pay honor to me and obey my wishes, since I can destroy your kingdom, Bane, by murdering your subjects, and I can starve your kingdom, Myrkul, by staying my hand.\"": "获得第三名的Bhaal宣称：\"我选择死亡，正是通过我的手，班恩大人你所统治的一切，最终将传给Myrkul大人。你们两个人都必须向我表示敬意，并服从我的意愿，因为我可以通过谋杀你的臣民来摧毁你的王国，班恩，而我可以通过留手来饿死你的王国，米尔库尔。\"",
	"Malar growled in frustration, but could do nothing, and so yet again only the beasts were left for him.": "马拉尔沮丧地咆哮着，但却无能为力，因此又一次只剩下野兽给他了。",
	"And Jergal merely smiled, for he had been delivered.": "耶格尔只是笑了笑，因为他已经得到了释放。",
	"the lord of the dead, the judge of the damned": "死者的主宰，被诅咒者的审判者",
	"Kelemvor is seen as a just, fair, and comforting god of death. Death comes to all, and when it occurs Kelemvor is there to take each soul by the hand and lead it to the proper afterlife. Kelemvor's priests teach that those who revere the gods according to the rites of their religion have done their proper service and will be offered the afterlife they seek.": "凯勒莫被视为一个公正、公平和令人欣慰的死神。死亡降临到所有人身上，而当死亡发生时，凯勒莫会在那里牵着每个灵魂的手，将其引向适当的来世。Kelemvor的祭司们教导说，那些按照他们的宗教仪式敬畏神灵的人已经做了适当的服务，并将获得他们所寻求的来世。",
	"The faithful of Kelemvor provide people with peaceful transitions into the care of the Lord of the Dead. They help the dying put their affairs in order, and they officiate at funeral rites for those who can't afford the lavish ceremonies of their faith. The tenets of Kelemvor's faithful compel them to forestall or prevent untimely deaths whenever possible. Different sects and worshipers define \"untimely\" in different ways. One group might concentrate on stopping the spread of disease, another on the prevention of murder, and yet another on eliminating the scourge of the undead. In fact, all the faithful of Kelemvor despise the undead and work to some degree to eliminate them, for undead of any sort are seen as an abomination of the natural order. This belief obviously puts Kelemvor's faithful at odds with necromancers, priests of Myrkul, and others who promote the creation of the undead, and it also causes conflict from unexpected sources. For instance, priests of Kelemvor routinely destroy any writings about the creation of the undead that they find—an act that offends those who value knowledge for its own sake, such as the faithful of Oghma and Deneir. And there also exist undead that aren't evil, such as the baelnorn, which the elves consider holy. Kelemvor's devotees seek the end of such beings regardless of that fact.": "Kelemvor的信众为人们提供和平过渡到亡灵之主的照顾。他们帮助濒临死亡的人把他们的事情安排好，并为那些负担不起他们信仰的奢华仪式的人主持葬礼仪式。凯勒莫的信徒的信条迫使他们尽可能地阻止或防止过早的死亡。不同的教派和崇拜者以不同的方式定义 \"不合时宜\"。一个团体可能专注于阻止疾病的传播，另一个专注于防止谋杀，还有一个专注于消除亡灵的祸害。事实上，所有Kelemvor的信徒都鄙视亡灵，并在某种程度上努力消除它们，因为任何形式的亡灵都被视为对自然秩序的憎恶。这种信仰显然使凯勒莫的信徒与死灵法师、米尔库尔的祭司以及其他提倡创造亡灵的人产生了矛盾，同时也造成了来自意想不到的冲突。例如，凯勒莫的牧师经常销毁他们发现的任何有关创造亡灵的著作--这种行为冒犯了那些为了知识而重视知识的人，比如奥格玛和迪尼尔的信徒。也有一些不邪恶的亡灵，比如精灵们认为神圣的baelnorn。凯勒莫的信徒们不顾这一事实，寻求这种生命的终结。",
	"the morninglord, inspiration's dawn, the rose-and-gold god": "晨曦之主，灵感的曙光，玫瑰和金色的上帝",
	"Lathander is the god of the spring, birth, and renewal, a deity of conception, vitality, youth, renewal, and self-perfection. He is god not of the sun but of the dawn, which represents the start of a new day filled with potential.": "拉桑德是春天、出生和复兴之神，是孕育、活力、年轻、更新和自我完善的神。他不是太阳之神，而是黎明之神，代表着充满潜力的新一天的开始。",
	"Lathander is a god of beginnings. People commonly offer a prayer to him before undertaking any journey or endeavor. Lathander's name is invoked to seal alliances and christen new ventures or companies. As a result, the god is very popular among the merchant classes, and the church has benefited accordingly.": "拉桑德是一个开始之神。人们在进行任何旅行或努力之前通常会向他祈祷。拉桑德的名字被用来封印联盟和为新的企业或公司洗礼。因此，该神在商人阶层中非常受欢迎，而教会也因此受益。",
	"The rising sun is his symbol, and his colors are the rose, gold, and violet of the dawn. Lathander's temples and shrines host a wide range of functions both municipal and personal. At such places folk get married in dawn ceremonies, announce the start of civic projects, and even give birth when possible, to provide the baby good fortune.": "旭日是他的象征，他的颜色是黎明的玫瑰色、金色和紫色。拉桑德的寺庙和神殿承载着广泛的功能，包括市政和个人。在这些地方，人们在黎明仪式上结婚，宣布公民项目的开始，甚至在可能的情况下分娩，以提供婴儿的好运。",
	"The faithful of Lathander embrace the founding of new communities and the growth of civilization, as long as that civilization gives everyone the potential to succeed. They despise the undead, seeing them as both a corruption of the natural order and a disavowal of new beginnings, because undead cling to their old existence rather than moving on.": "拉桑德的信徒们拥护新社区的建立和文明的发展，只要这种文明给了每个人成功的潜力。他们鄙视亡灵，认为它们既是对自然秩序的破坏，也是对新的开始的否定，因为亡灵坚持他们原来的存在而不是继续前进。",
	"the lady of the mists, mistshadow, the lady of deception": "迷雾中的女人, 迷雾中的女人, 欺骗的女人",
	"Leira has worn many masks, and more than once has been thought to be dead or to be another deity altogether. Perhaps such a reputation is only natural for the goddess of illusion and deception. Her faithful agree that whatever the \"truth\" might be, their Lady takes great delight in the confusion sown by her various incarnations. Even the faithful of Cyric once taught that their god killed Leira, but now they espouse the strange idea that somehow she is his daughter.": "莱拉戴过很多面具，而且不止一次被认为已经死亡或完全是另一个神灵。也许这样的声誉对幻觉和欺骗的女神来说是很自然的。她的信徒们同意，无论 \"真相 \"是什么，他们的夫人对她的各种化身所造成的混乱感到非常高兴。即使是西里奇的信徒也曾教导说他们的神杀死了莱拉，但现在他们支持一种奇怪的想法，即她是他的女儿。",
	"Leira isn't viewed as malicious or as a trickster but is seen as enigmatic, quiet, and retiring. She is credited with inventing Ruathlek, the language of illusionists and the spoken tongue of Nimbral.": "莱拉并不被认为是恶意的，也不被认为是诡计多端的人，而是被认为是神秘的、安静的、隐忍的。她被认为是发明了Ruathlek，即幻术师的语言和Nimbral的口头语言。",
	"The faithful of Leira seem to be scarce, although it is difficult to know this for certain, because those who favor her rarely make their inclinations known. Leira is the patron of illusionists and liars. She receives little regular worship except from illusionists, who pray to the Mistshadow for potency in their magic, and con artists, for whom she is a kind of champion. Most people pray to her when they hope to keep something secret, or placate her with a prayer before making an important decision when they fear being deceived. Some folk perform a swirling motion with a finger behind their backs when telling a lie as a way of beseeching her for aid.": "莱拉的信徒似乎很少，尽管很难确定这一点，因为那些支持她的人很少公开他们的倾向。莱拉是幻术师和说谎者的守护神。除了幻术师和骗子之外，她几乎没有收到任何常规的崇拜，幻术师向雾影祈祷，希望他们的魔法能有效力，而骗子则是她的一种支持者。大多数人在希望保守秘密时都会向她祈祷，或者在做出重要决定前担心被欺骗时用祈祷来安抚她。有些人在说谎话时用手指在背后做旋转动作，以此来祈求她的帮助。",
	"Her priests wear vestments of white and mist-gray, and their faces are covered by smooth, featureless masks. Only in Nimbral do temples to Leira exist, and shrines dedicated to her found across the continent are usually disguised as other kinds of sites, marked with signs that only the faithful would recognize.": "她的祭司穿着白色和雾灰色的法衣，他们的脸被光滑的、没有特征的面具所覆盖。只有在宁布拉尔才有雷拉的神庙，而在整个大陆上发现的供奉她的神庙通常被伪装成其他类型的场所，用只有信徒才能识别的标志来标示。",
	"our lady of joy, joybringer, the mistress of revels": "我们的欢乐女士，欢乐使者，狂欢的女主人",
	"Lliira is a beloved goddess, a deity of contentment, release, joy, happiness, dance, and freedom. As the patron of festivals, she is honored at any celebration, and dance is the primary way to worship her. The Mistress of Revels is said to abhor violence, and any fighting or drawing of weapons (except in ceremony) at a celebration will cause her to withhold her favor. Her priests and priestesses, known as joybringers, take it as their mission to make other people happy, even if just for a moment.": "莉莉拉是一位受人爱戴的女神，她是满足、释放、快乐、幸福、舞蹈和自由的神灵。作为节日的守护神，她在任何庆典上都受到尊敬，而舞蹈是崇拜她的主要方式。据说狂欢节的女主人憎恶暴力，在庆典上的任何打斗或拔出武器（仪式除外）都会引起她的不满。她的牧师和女祭司被称为 \"欢乐使者\"，他们把让别人快乐作为自己的使命，哪怕只是一瞬间。",
	"Her faithful always wear at least one clothing item of a bright, cheerful color, and her priests' vestments have more in common with festival attire than with somber ecclesial garments. Rubies and sapphires are sacred to Our Lady of Joy, and her priests bless anyone they see wearing such adornments.": "她的信徒总是至少穿一件颜色鲜艳、欢快的衣服，她的牧师的法衣与节日服装有更多的共同之处，而不是与阴沉的教会服装。红宝石和蓝宝石对欢乐圣母来说是神圣的，她的牧师们看到任何佩戴这种装饰品的人都会给予祝福。",
	"Lliira's followers aren't frivolous, however. To them, divine joy is a very real gift to the world of mortals, and one much needed. To that end, they fight those who would bring misery to others. They are fierce against their foes, and joyous revelers when their work is done.": "然而，Lliira的追随者并不轻佻。对他们来说，神圣的快乐是给凡人世界的一个非常真实的礼物，而且是非常需要的。为此，他们与那些会给他人带来痛苦的人战斗。他们猛烈地打击敌人，当他们的工作完成后，又是快乐的狂欢者。",
	"the maiden of pain, the scourge mistress, the willing whip": "痛苦的少女，祸害的女主人，自愿的鞭子",
	"Pain isn't a means to an end for Loviatar's faithful, but an end unto itself. To them, nothing is as transcendent as suffering, and all pain is holy, from the crudest barbarism, to the most sublime torture, to the emotional suffering of the heartbroken or the betrayed.": "痛苦对洛菲亚塔的信徒来说不是达到目的的手段，而是目的本身。对他们来说，没有什么比痛苦更超然的了，所有的痛苦都是神圣的，从最粗暴的野蛮，到最崇高的折磨，到伤心人或被背叛者的情感痛苦。",
	"The pain that one feels is proof of the Lady's attention, and so her faithful are notorious self-flagellants. Pain is also a path to power, in terms of both one's ability to inflict it and one's ability to endure it. A cold, cruel demeanor is considered ideal because it best emulates the Scourge Mistress, and for the same reason her faithful appreciate beauty, cultural refinement, and a certain adeptness at manipulation.": "一个人感受到的痛苦是夫人关注的证明，因此她的信徒是臭名昭著的自我鞭挞者。痛苦也是通往权力的途径，就一个人施加痛苦的能力和忍受痛苦的能力而言。冷酷无情的举止被认为是最理想的，因为它最能模仿祸害女主人，同样的原因，她的信众也欣赏美貌、文化修养和某种操纵的熟练程度。",
	"Though temples to Loviatar are rare, her faithful are more numerous than might be expected. Loviatar is the chosen deity of those who inflict pain as a matter of course, including torturers and others who need to break the will of their victims. She is favored by sadists and masochists, and some of her followers form cultish cells of secret adherents. Each of these groups is led by someone who takes pleasure in administering pain and dominating others, supported and backed up by a number of submissive sycophants.": "虽然洛菲塔尔的庙宇很少，但她的信徒却比想象中要多得多。洛菲亚塔是那些把痛苦当做理所当然的事情的人所选择的神灵，包括施虐者和其他需要摧毁受害者意志的人。她受到虐待狂和受虐狂的青睐，她的一些追随者形成了秘密信徒的邪教细胞。这些团体中的每一个都是由一个以实施痛苦和支配他人为乐的人领导，并由一些顺从的佞臣支持和支援。",
	"Worshipers of Loviatar rarely gather in numbers except in the more populous cities. When small cadres of faithful operate quietly in such places, few citizens take notice or raise a fuss if they do witness cult activity. The sufferers who endure the lash, however, aren't always willing participants, and Lovatar's cults sometimes operate secret slavery rings, which can draw the attention of the authorities. The open worship of Loviatar and temples clearly dedicated to her are rarely seen except in lands where slavery is an accepted practice.": "除了在人口较多的城市，洛维塔的崇拜者很少聚集在一起。当一小群信徒在这些地方悄悄地活动时，很少有市民注意到，或者在他们看到邪教活动时大惊小怪。然而，忍受鞭打的受难者并不总是心甘情愿地参与，洛瓦塔的邪教有时会运作秘密的奴役团伙，这可能引起当局的注意。除了在奴隶制被接受的地方，很少看到对洛瓦塔尔的公开崇拜和明显献给她的寺庙。",
	"the beastlord, the black-blooded one": "兽王，黑血的人",
	"Malar epitomizes the dark side of nature, the world that is red in tooth and claw. His faithful believe the hunt is the center point between life and death—the facing off of hunter and prey, forcing the issue of who lives and who dies. People believe that Malar can't be propitiated and knows no mercy, so he receives prayers only from those engaging in a hunt. Such supplicants pray to Malar for two reasons: to beg the aid of his peerless skill as a hunter, or to adopt his fearsome mantle and thus ward off other predators. Malar is the god of those who delight in the hunt, don't shy from bloodshed, and savor the fear of their prey.": "马拉尔是自然界黑暗面的缩影，是张牙舞爪的世界。他的信徒认为狩猎是生与死之间的中心点--猎人与猎物的对峙，迫使谁生谁死的问题。人们相信马拉尔不能被祭祀，也不知道怜悯，所以他只接受那些参与狩猎的人的祈祷。这些祈求者向马拉尔祈祷有两个原因：乞求他作为猎人的无敌技能的帮助，或者采用他可怕的衣钵，从而抵御其他掠夺者。马拉尔是那些以狩猎为乐、不避讳流血、享受猎物恐惧的人的神。",
	"Many lycanthropes consider Malar to be their divine father, as do some other intelligent predators. He has many devotees who are druids and rangers of particularly savage inclination, and many barbarians take Malar as a patron for his ferocity and cruelty. His priests use claw bracers, impressive gauntlets bedecked with stylized claws that jut out from the ends of the fists, as ceremonial weapons.": "许多狼人认为马拉尔是他们神圣的父亲，其他一些聪明的掠夺者也是如此。他有许多信徒，他们是德鲁伊和具有特别野蛮倾向的游侠，许多野蛮人把马拉尔作为他凶猛和残忍的守护者。他的祭司使用爪子手镯，令人印象深刻的铠甲，上面有从拳头末端伸出的风格化的爪子，作为仪式上的武器。",
	"the lord of shadows, the master of all thieves": "影子的主人，所有盗贼的主人",
	"Mask is a trickster god, the patron of ne'er-do-wells, spies, and thieves. All that occurs within shadow is in the purview of Mask. People whisper a prayer to Mask whenever stealth is required or intrigue is afoot. Courtiers and diplomats invoke the god's name in hopes of a smooth negotiation.": "面具是一个诡计多端的神，是不务正业者、间谍和盗贼的守护神。所有发生在阴影中的事情都在面具的管辖范围内。每当需要隐蔽或阴谋的时候，人们都会向面具低声祈祷。法院和外交官都会引用神的名字，希望谈判能顺利进行。",
	"Those who favor Mask usually pursue thievery and other forms of acquisition of what belongs to others, such as pickpocketing, burglary, mugging, and con games. Ordinary folk pray to him to avert his eyes from their valuables, but the cautious sometimes employ \"Mask's purse,\" a small, cheap cloth pouch worn in plain sight (thus easily cut or lifted) containing a small offering of coin. By convention, a pickpocket pilfers Mask's purse when encountering another person wearing one, and considers the gain a gift from the god, while the one who lost the purse is grateful to the Lord of Shadows for accepting a respectful sacrifice of a small portion of his goods. Of course, nothing prevents another pickpocket from targeting someone who has lost Mask's purse, but anyone with the ill luck to attract multiple pickpockets in a single outing has probably earned Mask's ire anyway.": "那些支持面具的人通常追求盗窃和其他形式的获取属于他人的东西，如扒窃、入室盗窃、抢劫和骗局。普通人向他祈祷，希望他能避开他们的贵重物品，但谨慎的人有时会使用 \"面具的钱包\"，这是一个廉价的小布袋，戴在明处（因此很容易被切割或提起），里面装着少量硬币。按照惯例，扒手在遇到另一个戴着面具的人时，会偷取面具的钱包，并认为这是神的礼物，而丢失钱包的人则感谢阴影之神接受了他一小部分货物的恭敬祭品。当然，没有什么能阻止另一个扒手把目标放在丢了面具钱包的人身上，但任何运气不好的人，在一次出游中吸引了多个扒手，都可能赢得了面具的愤怒。",
	"Priests of Mask are usually thieves by profession, and often serve as higher-ups in the local underworld or criminal syndicate. They go by the title of demarche or demarchess, and wear veil-masks when acting in their priestly capacity.": "面具祭司通常是以盗贼为职业，并经常在当地黑社会或犯罪集团中担任高级职务。他们的头衔是Demarche或Demarchess，以牧师身份行事时戴着面纱面具。",
	"our lady of the forest, the forest queen": "我们的森林女士，森林女王",
	"People rarely speak of Mielikki except in quiet forest spaces. Woodlands that evoke wonder are where she reigns supreme, but she is said to keep watch over good folk in any forest, not matter how dark or cruel. When children are lost in the woods, people beseech Mielikki to protect them until they are found.": "除了在安静的森林空间，人们很少谈论米利基。唤起人们好奇心的林地是她统治的地方，但据说她在任何森林里都能看护善良的人们，不管多么黑暗或残酷。当孩子们在森林里迷路时，人们会祈求米利基保护他们，直到他们被找到。",
	"Mielikki is the goddess of the forest and the creatures that live within it. She is seen as a remote and spiritual deity—less human-like than many other gods. She's not unmindful of people, but her attention and favor are difficult to attract. She is the patron of rangers in the same way that Milil is the patron of bards, but even rangers rarely pray to her directly. They instead pray to Gwaeron Windstrom, who they believe will carry their words to the goddess by tracking her to whichever forest she hides in.": "米利基是森林和生活在森林中的生物的女神。她被视为一个遥远而精神的神灵--比许多其他神灵更不像人。她并不是不关心人，但她的注意力和宠爱很难吸引。她是游侠的守护神，就像米利尔是吟游诗人的守护神一样，但即使游侠也很少直接向她祈祷。他们转而向格瓦隆-温德斯特伦（Gwaeron Windstrom）祈祷，他们相信格瓦隆-温德斯特伦会把他们的话带到女神那里，跟踪她到她所藏身的森林。",
	"Mielikki's symbol is a unicorn, which prompts some to think of her as such and conflate her with Lurue, Queen of the Unicorns and the actual goddess of their kind. But most tales depict Mielikki as a beautiful woman whom Lurue allows upon her back as a rider, and the two are thought to be boon companions. Mielikki's relationships with other deities of the natural world are more complex. Silvanus is sometimes thought of as her father and Eldath is considered her sister, but Mielikki walks her own path through the wilds.": "米利基的标志是一只独角兽，这使一些人认为她是独角兽，并将她与独角兽女王和它们的实际女神卢鲁伊混为一谈。但大多数故事将米利基描绘成一个美丽的女人，鲁鲁修允许她作为骑手骑在背上，两人被认为是好伙伴。米利基与自然界的其他神灵的关系更为复杂。希尔瓦娜斯有时被认为是她的父亲，艾尔达斯被认为是她的姐姐，但米利基在荒野中走着自己的路。",
	"She has many shrines, particularly in the Savage Frontier. Most consist of a dead tree trunk into which has been carved a likeness of her holy symbol, a unicorn's head. Alternatively, the likeness might be carved on a separate piece of wood and tacked to a living tree. These shrines typically mark the point in a forest beyond which locals know not to cut timber or hunt. Often these tributes are created by loggers at the end of a logging excursion as a mark of thanks to the goddess for providing the wood and for keeping the timber cutters safe during the work.": "她有许多神龛，特别是在野蛮人的边境地区。大多数都是由一棵枯树干组成，上面刻着她的神圣象征--独角兽的头像。或者，这个肖像可能被刻在一块单独的木头上，然后粘在一棵活树上。这些神龛通常标志着森林中的一个点，当地人知道超过这个点就不能砍伐木材或狩猎。这些神龛通常是由伐木工人在伐木结束后创建的，以感谢女神提供木材并在工作中保证伐木工人的安全。",
	"the lord of song, the one true hand of all-wise oghma": "歌声的主宰，全智的奥格玛的真正之手",
	"Milil is the god of poetry, eloquence, and song. He is a god of creativity and inspiration, of the entire song more than just the lyrics or the music. He represents the finished thought, the result of the process that takes an idea from conception to realization. Milil is most venerated by bards, troubadours, and other entertainers, but anyone preparing to entertain or speak before a crowd might offer Milil a brief prayer for a successful performance. Those who seek inspiration in a creative endeavor also pray to Milil.": "米利尔是诗歌、口才和歌曲之神。他是创意和灵感之神，是整首歌的神，而不仅仅是歌词或音乐。他代表完成的思想，是一个想法从构思到实现的过程的结果。米利尔最受吟游诗人、游吟诗人和其他艺人的敬仰，但任何准备在众人面前表演或讲话的人都可以向米利尔作简短的祈祷，以获得成功的表演。那些在创造性工作中寻求灵感的人也向米利尔祈祷。",
	"His icons depict him as a handsome male, sometimes a human, sometimes an elf, and even a half-elf in places (such as Aglarond) that have a large half-elf population. He is variously depicted as young or old, but his identity is always apparent because of his five-stringed harp made of silvery leaves, which he carries constantly. He is the ideal to which all performers aspire: poised and confident, winningly charismatic, and a source of inspiration for those who listen to him. He is said to have total recall of anything he hears or that is spoken while music plays, as well as utmost skill at improvisation.": "他的图标将他描绘成一个英俊的男性，有时是人类，有时是精灵，在有大量半精灵人口的地方（如阿格拉隆），甚至是半精灵。他被描述为年轻或年老，但他的身份总是显而易见的，因为他的五弦琴是由银色的树叶制成的，他一直带着它。他是所有表演者所向往的理想：姿态自信，魅力四射，是聆听他的人的灵感来源。据说，他能完全记住他所听到的或在音乐播放时所说的任何东西，并具有极强的即兴创作能力。",
	"Holy sites dedicated to Milil are often found in performance venues and schools of music. Whether the site is a vast concert hall or a small choral chamber, it must have excellent acoustic qualities. Milil's priests are patrons of the arts in addition to being performers themselves, and they frequently act as tutors in the arts of performance at his shrines and temples.": "献给米利尔的圣地经常出现在表演场所和音乐学校中。无论该场所是一个巨大的音乐厅还是一个小的合唱室，它都必须有良好的声学质量。米利尔的祭司除了自己是表演者外，还是艺术的赞助人，他们经常在他的神殿和庙宇里担任表演艺术的导师。",
	"Like Deneir, Milil is sometimes thought of as being in service to Oghma. In these portrayals of the deity, Milil is the god's left hand, also referred to as the One True Hand. This expression isn't meant to denigrate the right hand (Deneir); rather, it stems from the fact that left-handedness is more often associated with great artistic ability and the belief that the greatest art comes from the acceptance of truth.": "与德内尔一样，米利尔有时被认为是为奥格玛服务的。在这些对神的描绘中，米利尔是神的左手，也被称为 \"唯一的真手\"。这种说法并不是要诋毁右手（Deneir）；相反，它源于这样一个事实，即左撇子更经常与伟大的艺术能力和最伟大的艺术来自于对真理的接受这一信念相关联。",
	"the lord of bones, old lord skull, the reaper": "骨头之王，骷髅老爷，收割者",
	"Myrkul is an ancient god, one of three former mortals who were raised to deityhood when Jergal grew weary of his divine duties and distributed his influence between them. Myrkul became the god of death and the dead, and ruled over the City of the Dead for centuries until he, in turn, was slain. In time Myrkul returned, for can death itself truly ever die? Myrkul's faithful see him as the Reaper, who lays claim to souls and brings them to Kelemvor to be judged.": "米尔库是一个古老的神，是三个前凡人中的一个，当杰格尔对他的神职感到厌倦并在他们之间分配他的影响时，他们被提升到神的地位。米尔库成为死亡和亡灵之神，统治亡灵之城达数百年之久，直到他反过来被杀。随着时间的推移，Myrkul回来了，因为死亡本身真的会死吗？Myrkul的信徒将他视为收割者，他对灵魂提出要求，并将它们带到Kelemvor接受审判。",
	"Myrkul is a deity of death, decay, old age, exhaustion, dusk, and autumn. He's the god of the ending of things and hopelessness, as much as Lathander is the god of beginnings and hope. Folk don't pray to Myrkul so much as dread him and blame him for aching bones and fading vision. Myrkul is thought to be passionless and uncaring even of his most devout worshipers. Those who take Myrkul as a patron tend to be morose, taciturn, and obsessed with the dead and the undead. Like many followers of Kelemvor and Jergal, priests of Myrkul serve as undertakers and typically keep their patron's identity secret.": "密尔库尔是死亡、腐烂、年老、疲惫、黄昏和秋天的神灵。他是事物结束和无望之神，就像拉坦德是开始和希望之神一样。民间并不向米尔库尔祈祷，而是害怕他，把骨头疼痛和视力减退归咎于他。Myrkul被认为是没有激情的，甚至对他最虔诚的崇拜者也毫不关心。那些把米尔库尔当做守护神的人往往情绪低落、沉默寡言，并且对死人和亡灵着迷。像许多凯勒莫和杰格尔的追随者一样，米尔库尔的祭司担任殡仪员，通常对其守护者的身份保密。",
	"Shrines to Myrkul or engravings of his holy symbol appear in many places where humans bury their dead, but full-fledged temples are rare. The few that exist are hallowed places where the dead from hundreds of miles around are brought for internment, even if they were not of Myrkul's faith. There is little space set aside for the living in such a location, usually a single modest shrine, but its catacombs and ossuaries are vast. In the deepest chamber of each temple rests a throne, and upon that throne sits the doomwarden—the preserved corpse of the most revered saint in the history of the temple (often its founder). Initiates to the faith are brought to kneel before a temple's doomwarden, where they must spend a night and a day fasting and meditating in complete darkness.": "在人类埋葬死者的许多地方都有米尔库尔的神龛或他的神圣标志的雕刻，但正式的寺庙却很少。少数存在的寺庙是神圣的地方，周围数百英里的死者被带到这里安葬，即使他们不属于Myrkul的信仰。在这样的地方，为生者预留的空间很少，通常只有一个简陋的神龛，但它的地下墓穴和骨髓库却很庞大。在每个神庙的最深处有一个宝座，宝座上坐着末日使者--神庙历史上最受尊敬的圣人（通常是其创始人）的保存的尸体。信仰的入门者会被带到寺庙的守夜人面前跪下，他们必须在完全黑暗的环境中禁食和冥想一晚和一天。",
	"the lady of mysteries, our lady of spells, the mother of all magic": "神秘的女士，我们的法术女士，所有魔法之母",
	"Mystra is the goddess of magic, and with that the goddess of possibilities. She is venerated by mages and by those who use magic or magical objects in their daily lives. She also receives the prayers of those who find magic wondrous or encounter magic they fear. Mystra is the goddess of the essential force that makes all spellcasting possible. She provides and tends the Weave, the conduit through which mortal spellcasters and magical crafters can safely access the raw force of magic.": "密斯特拉是魔法女神，同时也是可能性的女神。她受到法师和那些在日常生活中使用魔法或魔法物品的人的敬仰。她也接受那些发现魔法神奇或遇到他们害怕的魔法的人的祈祷。米斯特拉是使所有施法成为可能的基本力量的女神。她提供并管理着 \"编织\"，是凡人施法者和魔法工匠能够安全地获得原始魔法力量的渠道。",
	"The faith of Mystra is pervasive in Faerûn, which is to be expected for a land as touched by magic as it is. Her worshipers include those who use magic or work closely with it, such as alchemists and sages. The blue-clad priests of Mystran temples count wizards and sorcerers among their numbers, as well as the occasional bard. The goal of Mystra's faithful is simple: that magic be preserved and promulgated throughout the Realms. It isn't unusual for her followers to keep an eye out for those who demonstrate high potential for using magic and help arrange for such persons to find tutelage with a suitable mentor.": "Mystra的信仰在Faerûn无处不在，这对于一个被魔法触及的土地来说是可以预期的。她的崇拜者包括那些使用魔法或与之密切合作的人，如炼金术士和圣人。神秘人寺庙的蓝衣祭司中也有魔法师和巫师，以及偶尔出现的吟游诗人。米斯特拉的信徒们的目标很简单：在整个王国中保存和推广魔法。她的追随者们通常会留意那些在使用魔法方面表现出高度潜力的人，并帮助安排这些人找到合适的导师进行指导。",
	"the binder, the lord of knowledge": "知识的主宰--装订者",
	"Oghma is the god of inspiration, invention, and knowledge. Above all else, Oghma represents knowledge in its most supreme, raw form—the idea. An aphorism cited by his faithful about this concept serves them as a prayer when it is repeated aloud: \"An idea has no heft but it can move mountains. An idea has no authority but it can dominate people. An idea has no strength but it can push aside empires. Knowledge is the greatest tool of the mortal mind, outweighing anything made by mortal hands. Before anything else can exist, the idea must exist.\"": "Oghma是灵感、发明和知识之神。最重要的是，奥格玛代表着知识的最高、最原始的形式--理念。他的信徒们引用的关于这个概念的箴言，当它被大声重复的时候，可以作为他们的祈祷词。\"一个想法没有重量，但它可以移动山脉。一个想法没有权威，但它可以主宰人。一个想法没有力量，但它可以推开帝国。知识是凡人头脑中最伟大的工具，胜过凡人手中的任何东西。在其他任何东西能够存在之前，思想必须存在\"。",
	"Oghma's faithful spread knowledge and literacy as widely as possible, believing that minds ought never to be shackled by ignorance and thus not be able to bequeath the benefit they might otherwise provide their fellows. Not surprisingly, those who follow Oghma oppose those who foster deceit, trickery, and ignorance.": "Oghma的信徒尽可能广泛地传播知识和文化，他们认为思想不应该被无知所束缚，从而不能留下他们可能提供给同伴的好处。毫不奇怪，那些追随Oghma的人反对那些助长欺骗、诡计和无知的人。",
	"Folk of many professions favor the Binder: wizards, cartographers, artists, bards, clerks, inventors, sages, scribes, and all manner of others who uncover, preserve, and create knowledge and learning. The worship of Oghma was, at one point, one of the few organized faiths in Faerûn that had an established orthodoxy and a complete network of temples that adhered to that orthodoxy. Schisms during the Time of Troubles shattered that network, and now the structures that house the faith are individual temples or small networks of allied temples, much in the manner of other faiths.": "许多职业的人都喜欢装订者：巫师、制图师、艺术家、吟游诗人、文员、发明家、圣人、抄写员，以及其他各种发掘、保存和创造知识和学问的人。对奥格玛的崇拜一度是法鲁恩为数不多的有组织的信仰之一，它有一个既定的正统观念和一个完整的寺庙网络，坚持该正统观念。动乱时期的分裂打破了这一网络，现在容纳该信仰的结构是单独的寺庙或小型的联盟寺庙网络，与其他信仰的方式很相似。",
	"the lady of strategy, the crimson general, the grandmaster of the lanceboard": "战略女士，深红将军，长枪短炮的祖师爷",
	"The Red Knight is the goddess of planning and strategy. Those who favor her call themselves the Red Fellowship. They believe wars are won by the best planning, strategy, and tactics. The worship of the Red Knight is filled with doctrine about strategy, such as: \"Every war is a series of battles. Losing one doesn't mean losing the war.\" \"In war, plan for peace. In peace, plan for war.\" \"Seek allies among your enemy's enemies.\"": "红骑士是计划和战略的女神。那些拥护她的人称自己为红色团契。他们相信战争是由最好的计划、战略和战术赢得的。对红骑士的崇拜充满了关于战略的学说，例如。\"每场战争都是一系列的战斗。输掉一场并不意味着输掉这场战争\"。\"在战争中，为和平做打算。在和平中，要为战争做打算。\" \"在敌人的敌人中寻找盟友\"。",
	"Worship of the Red Knight arose among a hero-venerating monastic order of Tempus in Tethyr shortly after the Time of Troubles. The Red Knight has since grown in popularity because of what her followers call the Great Stratagem: for decades, her priests have been traveling to places of warfare to educate generals and kings in the arts of strategy and battlefield tactics. Many of the leaders they approached turned them away at first, but it soon became apparent that those who accepted the counsel of the Crimson General's followers gained a distinct benefit. Grateful victors built temples to the Lady of Strategy, and gradually her faith spread.": "乱世之后不久，在泰特希尔的一个崇拜英雄的修道会中出现了对红骑士的崇拜。由于她的追随者称之为 \"伟大的计谋\"，红衣骑士从此变得越来越受欢迎：几十年来，她的牧师们一直前往战争之地，向将军和国王们传授战略和战场战术的艺术。起初，他们接触的许多领导人都拒绝了他们，但很快就发现，那些接受深红将军的追随者的建议的人获得了明显的好处。感激的胜利者们为战略女神建造了寺庙，她的信仰也逐渐传播开来。",
	"Today, followers of the Red Knight can be found in nearly any land that has seen warfare in the past century. Worshipers of the Red Knight are rare in the general population, but those who revere her can frequently be found among high-ranking commanders of armies, instructors in colleges of war, quartermasters, and the authors of tomes of strategy. Each temple to the Red Knight includes an altar dedicated to Tempus, and so such a place is likely to be frequented by mercenaries and soldiers. A temple is surrounded by a vast pavilion and courtyard, which can be rented by companies of soldiers and mercenaries for practice and training. Her priests believe that drilling one's troops in a temple courtyard is a form of propitiation that the Red Knight looks upon with special favor.": "今天，几乎所有在过去一个世纪里发生过战争的土地上都能找到红骑士的追随者。红骑士的崇拜者在普通人中很少见，但在军队的高级指挥官、战争学院的教官、军需官和战略书的作者中，经常可以看到崇敬她的人。每座红衣骑士的神庙都有一个供奉坦帕斯的祭坛，因此这样的地方很可能是雇佣兵和士兵经常光顾的地方。寺庙周围有一个巨大的亭子和院子，士兵和佣兵公司可以租用这些地方进行练习和训练。她的牧师们认为，在神庙的院子里操练军队是一种祭祀的形式，红衣骑士对其特别青睐。",
	"the all-seeing, the third eye, divination's lord": "第三只眼，占卜的主宰者",
	"Savras is a god of divination and fortunetelling. Few people worship him, but many pray to him when performing small rituals of foresight. For example, young men and women sometimes attempt to divine the names of their future spouses by saying a rhyming chant that calls upon Savras while gazing in a mirror.": "萨弗拉是一个占卜和算命的神。很少有人崇拜他，但许多人在举行预知的小仪式时向他祈祷。例如，年轻男子和妇女有时会在照镜子时，通过念念有词的咒语，呼唤萨瓦拉，试图占卜他们未来配偶的名字。",
	"Savras has no currently active temples in Faerûn, and his shrines are few and far between, tucked away in the corners of libraries and scriptoria. Despite this lack of prominence, certain folk pay regular homage to Savras, including investigators, diviners, judges, and others who have a need to uncover the truth. Such individuals can sometimes be identified by the elaborate staffs they carry in homage to Savras. According to legend, Savras was trapped in Azuth's staff for ages. Azuth eventually freed Savras so long as Savras swore fealty, and today the staff is a potent symbol for those who revere Savras. Devout worshipers take great pains to decorate and embellish their staffs, each hoping that Savras might find it a welcoming place to stop for a time.": "萨弗拉斯目前在法鲁恩没有活跃的寺庙，他的神龛也很少，都藏在图书馆和剧本馆的角落里。尽管他的地位并不显赫，但某些人还是经常向萨弗拉斯致敬，包括调查员、占卜师、法官和其他需要揭开真相的人。这些人有时可以通过他们携带的向萨弗拉斯致敬的精致法杖来识别。根据传说，萨弗拉被困于阿祖斯的法杖中已久。只要萨乌斯宣誓效忠，阿祖斯最终释放了萨乌斯，如今这根法杖是那些敬仰萨乌斯的人的有力象征。虔诚的崇拜者不遗余力地装饰和修饰他们的法杖，每个人都希望萨弗拉斯能发现它是一个受欢迎的地方，可以停留一段时间。",
	"our lady of silver, the moonmaiden, the night white lady": "我们的银发女郎，月亮女郎，夜白女郎",
	"Selûne is thought to be among the most ancient of Faerûn's deities. Most humans in Faerûn consider the moon in the sky to literally be the goddess gazing down on the world, and the trailing motes of light behind it her tears. She is also a goddess of stars and navigation as well as motherhood and reproductive cycles. She is seen as a calm power, frequently venerated by female humans as well as by a mix of other folk: navigators and sailors, those who work honestly at night, those seeking protection in the dark, the lost, and the questing.": "塞鲁尼被认为是法鲁恩最古老的神灵之一。法鲁恩的大多数人类认为天空中的月亮就是女神在凝视着这个世界，而月亮后面的拖曳光斑就是她的眼泪。她也是星星和导航以及母性和生殖周期的女神。她被视为一种平静的力量，经常被女性人类以及其他民间混合体所敬仰：航海家和水手，那些在夜间诚实工作的人，那些在黑暗中寻求保护的人，迷路的人，以及探索的人。",
	"There are many legends about Selûne, chief among them being the tale of the battle at the beginning of time between Selûne and her sister, Shar. The Tears of Selûne, the cluster of starry lights that follow the moon around the sky, are thought to be brought about by the goddess's joy, sorrow, or both.": "有许多关于塞卢恩的传说，其中最主要的是塞卢恩和她的妹妹沙尔在时间之初的战斗故事。塞卢恩的眼泪，是跟随月亮在天空中出现的一簇星光，被认为是由女神的快乐、悲伤或两者同时带来的。",
	"Milk, a symbol of motherhood, is used in many rites performed by the worshipers of Selûne, as are trances and meditation. Those who favor her typically set a bowl of milk outside on each night of the full moon.": "牛奶是母性的象征，在塞鲁尼的崇拜者举行的许多仪式中，都会用到牛奶，就像安眠和冥想一样。赞成她的人通常在每个月圆之夜在外面放一碗牛奶。",
	"the mistress of the night, the dark lady, our lady of loss": "夜晚的女主人，黑暗的女士，我们的损失的女士",
	"The dark twin of Selûne, Shar is the goddess of darkness, both in its physical form and as it exists in the minds and souls of mortals. People worship Shar as the goddess of night, secrets, loss, and forgetfulness. She represents pains hidden but not forgotten, and vengeances carefully nurtured away from the light. She is said to have the power to make folk forget their pain or become inured to a loss, and many people in distress pray to Shar for such a blessing.": "沙尔是塞鲁恩的黑暗双胞胎，是黑暗的女神，无论是物理形式还是存在于凡人的思想和灵魂中。人们把夏尔当作黑夜、秘密、损失和遗忘的女神来崇拜。她代表着隐藏但不被遗忘的痛苦，以及远离光明而精心培育的复仇。据说她有能力让人们忘记他们的痛苦，或对损失变得麻木不仁，许多处于困境的人向夏尔祈求这种祝福。",
	"Shar is revered by those who must venture into dark places and so pray to her for protection, such as miners, as well as by those who have fallen into melancholy and despair, who wish to forget something, or who have lost something and wish to recover it. Priests drawn to serve Shar often nurture their own deep wounds or dark secrets, which in their minds makes them best suited to console those who suffer from a similar ill. Throughout the world's history, many followers of Shar have done dark deeds in her name—most notably the shadovar of Netheril, an entire society dedicated to Shar. The tragedies and losses brought about by the fanaticism of her followers have caused many places to outlaw her worship and thus driven most of her priests into secrecy, but such prohibitions only heighten the priests' umbrage at authorities and make the faithful a focal point for rebellion and revenge against whoever rules.": "Shar受到那些必须冒险进入黑暗之地并因此向她祈求保护的人的敬重，例如矿工，以及那些陷入忧郁和绝望的人，他们希望忘记一些东西，或者失去一些东西并希望找回它。被吸引来为夏尔服务的牧师往往养育着他们自己的深层伤口或黑暗的秘密，在他们心中，这使他们最适合安慰那些遭受类似疾病的人。在整个世界的历史中，许多夏尔的追随者以她的名义做了一些黑暗的事情--最引人注目的是尼瑟尔的沙多瓦，一个致力于夏尔的整个社会。她的追随者的狂热所带来的悲剧和损失导致许多地方禁止对她的崇拜，从而使她的大多数祭司陷入隐秘之中，但这种禁令只会加剧祭司们对当局的不满，使信徒们成为叛乱和报复谁的焦点。",
	"oak father, the old oak, old father tree": "橡树父亲，老橡树，老父亲树",
	"Silvanus represents the entirety of nature, deserts as well as forests, sharks as much as deer. But folk in the North, who contend with the dangers of forests, mountains, and plains, see Silvanus more as a god of those places. Silvanus is thought of as a grim and severe father figure who metes out flood and drought, fire and ice, and life and death in the wilderness. In legends he often commands other nature deities, dealing out rewards and punishments to them as is fitting.": "希尔瓦娜斯代表整个自然界，沙漠和森林，鲨鱼和鹿一样多。但在北方，与森林、山脉和平原的危险抗争的人们，更多地将希尔瓦娜斯视为这些地方的神。希尔瓦娜斯被认为是一个严酷的父亲形象，他在荒野中施展洪水和干旱、火焰和冰块、生命和死亡。在传说中，他经常指挥其他自然神灵，对他们进行适当的奖励和惩罚。",
	"Nature and its impartial fairness is central to the dogma of Silvanus's faith. His priests seek to know the total situation, to view the macrocosm; their viewpoint isn't confined to one person's or one nation's idea of what is best. The loss of a farming community to goblin raids is a tragedy for some, but the event provides an opportunity for the wilderness to grow up and make the land fertile again, which in turn provides new challenges for those who would return to tame it.": "自然及其公正的公平性是希尔瓦娜斯信仰教条的核心。他的牧师们寻求了解整体情况，观察宏观世界；他们的观点并不局限于一个人或一个国家对什么是最好的想法。一个农业社区因地精的袭击而消失，对一些人来说是个悲剧，但这一事件为荒野提供了一个机会，使土地重新变得肥沃，这反过来又为那些将返回驯服土地的人提供了新的挑战。",
	"The creed of Silvanus dictates that nature's glory must be preserved not merely because nature is beautiful, but because wild nature is the true state of the world. Its expanses refresh and revitalize the mortal soul, and give breath to all the world. Many of his faithful oppose the expansion of settlements into wild places, and consider excessive consumption of natural resources to be not only wasteful but blasphemous.": "西尔瓦努斯的信条规定，自然界的光辉必须得到保护，不仅仅是因为自然界是美丽的，还因为野生自然界是世界的真实状态。它的广袤让凡人的灵魂焕发活力，并给所有的世界带来气息。他的许多信徒反对将定居点扩展到野外，并认为对自然资源的过度消耗不仅是浪费，而且是亵渎。",
	"Silvanus often receives veneration from travelers in wild lands, explorers, and residents of rural communities far from the protection of a local lord or a great city. The oak leaf is Silvanus's symbol, and a grove of oak trees within a village or on its outskirts is often dedicated as a shrine to him. In rural places where oak trees don't grow, an oak leaf etched into the bark of another kind of tree signifies a sacred site.": "希尔瓦娜斯经常受到野地旅行者、探险家和远离当地领主或大城市保护的农村社区居民的敬仰。橡树叶是希尔瓦娜斯的象征，村子里或郊区的橡树林常常被作为圣地献给他。在不生长橡树的农村地区，将橡树叶刻在另一种树的树皮上，象征着一个圣地。",
	"lady firehair, the lady of love, the princess of passion": "火毛女士，爱的女士，激情的公主",
	"Sune Firehair is a deity of passion and the delights of the senses. She is the goddess of beauty in all its forms—not just pleasing sights, but also enchanting sounds, luxurious tastes and scents, and the exquisite pleasures of the flesh, from a lover's caress to the brush of silk on the skin. Her worshipers seek out these pleasures in life, not out of mere decadence, but because the experience of pleasure is the touch of Sune herself.": "苏妮-弗海尔是一位激情和感官享受的神灵。她是各种形式的美的女神--不仅仅是令人愉悦的景象，还有迷人的声音、奢华的味道和气味，以及肉体的精致快乐，从情人的爱抚到皮肤上的丝绸刷。她的崇拜者在生活中寻求这些快乐，不是出于单纯的颓废，而是因为快乐的体验就是苏妮本人的触摸。",
	"The followers of Sune have a reputation as hedonists, and so they are, to a degree. More than that, her priests foster beauty in the world. They do so by creating art, by acting as patrons for promising talents, and by investing in merchants who bring luxuries to far-off places that have never seen satin or tasted a luscious wine.": "苏妮的追随者有享乐主义的名声，在某种程度上，他们也是如此。不仅如此，她的祭司们还在世界范围内培养美。他们通过创造艺术，作为有前途的人才的赞助人，以及投资于将奢侈品带到从未见过绸缎或品尝过美味葡萄酒的遥远地方的商人，来做到这一点。",
	"Her priests consider loveliness to be one of their greatest callings, and all are trained in comportment, fashion, and cosmetics. Indeed, so talented are Sune's priests in the creation of beautiful appearances that many take pride in their ability to present themselves as stunningly attractive examples of either gender.": "她的牧师们认为美丽是他们最大的使命之一，所有的人都接受过礼仪、时尚和化妆品方面的培训。事实上，苏妮的牧师们在创造美丽的外表方面是如此有天赋，以至于许多人都为自己能够作为两性中令人惊叹的例子而感到自豪。",
	"But beauty is more than skin deep, say the Sunites; it issues from the core of one's being and shows one's true face to the world, whether fair or foul. The followers of Sune are believers in romance, true love winning over all, and following one's heart to one's true destination. Fated matches, impossible loves, and ugly ducklings becoming swans are all in the purview of Sune.": "但是，苏尼人说，美不仅仅是皮肤上的，它来自一个人的核心，向世界展示一个人的真实面目，无论是公平的还是肮脏的。苏妮的追随者相信浪漫，相信真爱能战胜一切，相信跟随自己的心去寻找真正的目的地。命中注定的比赛，不可能的爱情，以及丑小鸭变成天鹅，都在苏妮的职权范围内。",
	"Temples dedicated to Sune are common in human lands, and they frequently serve as public baths and places of relaxation. A temple usually features a mirrored and well-lit salon where folks can primp, as well as see others and be seen. Where a temple doesn't exist, or in a large city where the nearest temple might be too far to walk to, a small shrine to Sune often stands near a street corner. These sites consist of a mirror hung beneath a small roof where one can say a prayer while checking one's appearance. The spot might feature a shelf or a cupboard holding various perfumes and cosmetics so that those without the funds to purchase such items can still make themselves feel beautiful.": "献给苏妮的寺庙在人类的土地上很常见，它们经常作为公共浴室和放松的地方。寺庙通常有一个有镜子的、光线充足的沙龙，人们可以在那里梳妆打扮，也可以看到别人，被别人看到。在没有寺庙的地方，或者在大城市里，最近的寺庙可能太远，无法步行前往，苏妮的小神龛往往矗立在街角附近。这些场所由悬挂在小屋顶下的镜子组成，人们可以在那里一边祈祷一边检查自己的外表。这个地方可能有一个架子或一个柜子，里面放着各种香水和化妆品，以便那些没有资金购买这些物品的人仍然可以让自己感到美丽。",

Depicted in temple iconography as a withered crone with a cup or a vase that holds all the varieties of disease and poison, Talona is a fearsome goddess, and many are the prayers that beg her for protection from illness and poison. Various rituals to placate her involve the use of three drops of blood or three tears—to be dropped into a well that has gone bad, dripped into the handkerchief of someone beset by coughing, dropped into a fire made by burning a withered crop, dripped into the mouth of a plague sufferer, and so on. It's common practice to mark a container of poison with her holy symbol, three droplets in a triangle, and during epidemics folk paint the same image on the homes of the infected.": "塔罗娜是法鲁恩最常祈求的神灵之一，她是疾病和毒药的女神，从普通疾病到庄稼歉收，再到咸水井和瘟疫，她都要负责。塔罗娜在神庙中被描绘成一个枯萎的老妪，手里拿着一个杯子或花瓶，里面装着各种疾病和毒药，塔罗娜是一个可怕的女神，很多人都在祈祷，希望她能保护自己免受疾病和毒药的伤害。安抚她的各种仪式包括使用三滴血或三滴眼泪--滴入变坏的井中，滴入被咳嗽困扰的人的手帕中，滴入燃烧枯萎作物的火中，滴入瘟疫患者的口中，等等。通常的做法是在装毒药的容器上标上她的神圣符号，即三角形中的三个水滴，而在流行病期间，民间也会在感染者的家里画上同样的图案。",
	"Though she is often the recipient of prayers, Talona has almost no temples and few cults dedicated to her. A cult or a shrine to her might arise in an area after it suffers from pestilence, when some of those who survived decide to revere her or even become priests.": "虽然她经常接受祈祷，但塔罗娜几乎没有寺庙，也很少有崇拜她的人。在一个地区遭受瘟疫后，当一些幸存的人决定敬仰她甚至成为祭司时，可能会出现对她的崇拜或神龛。",
	"stormlord, the destroyer": "毁灭者风暴领主",
	"Talos is the dark side of nature, the uncaring and destructive force that might strike at any time. He is the god of storms, forest fires, earthquakes, tornadoes, and general destruction. He counts the ravager, the raider, the looter, and the brigand among his followers. Those who favor him see life as a succession of random effects in a sea of chaos, so the devout should grab what they can, when they can—for who can say when Talos will strike and send them into the afterlife?": "塔洛斯是自然界的黑暗面，是无情的破坏性力量，随时都可能发作。他是风暴、森林火灾、地震、龙卷风和一般破坏之神。他的追随者中包括掠夺者、袭击者、掠夺者和强盗。那些支持他的人把生命看作是混乱之海中的一连串随机效应，所以虔诚的人应该在他们能做到的时候抓住他们能做到的，因为谁能说塔洛斯什么时候会袭击他们并把他们送进来世呢？",
	"Talos is portrayed as a broad-shouldered, bearded young man with a single good eye, the other covered by a dark patch. He is said to carry a collection of three staffs, made from the first tree cut down in the world, the first silver smelted, and the first iron forged. He uses these staffs to raise destructive winds, cause terrible storms, and split the land in acts of rage. The three lightning bolts of his holy symbol represent these staffs, and when he vents his wrath on the world, he is thought to hurl them down from the sky as lightning strikes.": "塔洛斯被描绘成一个宽肩的、有胡子的年轻人，只有一只好眼睛，另一只眼睛被一个黑斑覆盖。据说他手持三根法杖，这三根法杖是由世界上第一棵被砍伐的树、第一块被冶炼的银和第一块被锻造的铁制成的。他用这些法杖刮起破坏性的风，引起可怕的风暴，并在愤怒中分裂土地。他的神圣标志中的三道闪电代表这些法杖，当他向世界发泄愤怒时，人们认为他将这些法杖作为闪电从天上扔下来。",
	"Although Talos is a popular deity, his name is invoked more often out of fear than out of reverence. He does have priests, mostly traveling doomsayers, who warn of disasters to come and accept charity in exchange for blessings of protection. Many of his faithful wear a black eyepatch, even if both eyes are intact.": "虽然塔洛斯是一个受欢迎的神灵，但他的名字更多的是出于恐惧而不是崇敬而被引用。他确实有祭司，大多是旅行中的预言家，他们警告即将到来的灾难，并接受慈善以换取保护的祝福。他的许多信徒都戴着黑色的眼罩，即使两只眼睛都是完整的。",
	"the foehammer, the lord of battles": "战斗的主宰--佛哈默",
	"Tempus is a war god concerned with brave conduct during war, using force of arms over talk for settling disputes, and encouraging bloodshed. The god of war is random in his favors, meaning that his chaotic nature favors all sides equally. Lord Tempus might be an army's ally one day, and its enemy the next. He might seem to manifest before a battle, appearing to one side or the other. If he is seen riding a white mare (Veiros), then the army will succeed. If he rides a black stallion (Deiros), then defeat is certain. Most often he appears to be riding with one foot in each mount's stirrup, signifying the unpredictable nature of battle. In such visions, Tempus is always a powerfully built warrior dressed for battle in the style of those who envision him.": "坦帕斯是一位战神，关注战争期间的勇敢行为，使用武力而不是谈话来解决争端，并鼓励流血。战争之神的宠爱是随机的，这意味着他的混乱本性对所有各方的宠爱是平等的。坦普斯勋爵可能在某一天成为一支军队的盟友，而第二天又成为其敌人。他可能会在战斗前显灵，出现在一方或另一方。如果他被看到骑着一匹白色的母马（Veiros），那么军队就会成功。如果他骑着一匹黑色的骏马（Deiros），那么失败是肯定的。最常见的情况是，他在骑马时，每匹坐骑都有一只脚踩在马镫上，表示战斗的不可预测性。在这样的幻象中，坦普斯总是一个身强力壮的战士，按照设想他的人的风格为战斗而打扮。",
	"Tempus's favor might be randomly distributed, but over the centuries his priests have made an effort to spread and enforce a common code of warfare—to make war a thing of rules, respect for reputations, and professional behavior. This code, called Tempus's Honor, has the purpose of making conflicts brief, decisive, and as safe as possible for those not directly involved. The rules in the code include the following: arm anyone who has need of a weapon; disparage no foe; acquit oneself with bravery; train all for battle; and don't engage in feuds. Those who poison wells, taint fields, kill noncombatants, or engage in torture in the name of war are all considered sinners.": "Tempus的宠爱可能是随机分配的，但几个世纪以来，他的牧师们努力传播和执行共同的战争准则--使战争成为一种规则、对声誉的尊重和专业行为。这套被称为 \"坦普斯的荣誉 \"的守则，其目的是使冲突简短、果断，并且对那些没有直接参与的人来说尽可能安全。守则中的规则包括以下内容：武装任何需要武器的人；不贬低任何敌人；勇敢地证明自己；为战斗训练所有人；不参与争斗。那些在井中投毒、玷污田地、杀害非战斗人员或以战争的名义从事酷刑的人都被视为罪人。",
	"Worshipers of Tempus are legion, and his name is often on the lips of soldiers. His priests are tacticians, often skilled in the art of war. Many of his ordained don't serve in temples, but as battlefield chaplains with armies and mercenary companies, encouraging their fellow soldiers with both word and blade. Priests of Tempus teach that war conducted properly is fair in that it oppresses all sides equally, and that in any given battle, a mortal might be slain or might become a great leader among his or her companions. Mortals shouldn't fear war but should see it as a natural force, the storm that civilization brings about by its very existence.": "崇拜坦普斯的人很多，他的名字经常出现在士兵的口中。他的祭司是战术家，通常精通战争艺术。他的许多受戒者不在寺庙中服务，而是作为军队和雇佣兵公司的战场牧师，用语言和刀剑鼓励他们的士兵。坦普斯的祭司们教导说，正确进行的战争是公平的，因为它平等地压迫所有各方，而且在任何特定的战斗中，一个凡人可能被杀，也可能成为他或她的同伴中的伟大领袖。凡人不应该害怕战争，而应该把它看作是一种自然力量，是文明的存在所带来的风暴。",
	"the loyal fury, the true, the hand of righteousness": "忠诚的怒火，真实的，正义的手",
	"Torm is the god of duty and loyalty, revered by those who face danger to bring about a greater good. Those who favor Torm believe that one's salvation can be found through service, that every failure to perform one's duty diminishes Torm, and that every success adds to his luster. Those who take Torm to heart must strive to fulfill his commandment to go out into the world and be an active force for good, to right wrongs, and to help the hopeless. They must strive to maintain peace and order while opposing unjust laws. Followers of Torm stand ever alert against corruption and are expected to strike quickly and hard against any evidence of rot in the hearts of mortals. As the sword arm of justice, Torm's faithful are expected to bring quick deaths to betrayers. Considering these tenets, it should be no surprise that most human paladins have Torm as their patron.": "托尔姆是责任和忠诚之神，受到那些为实现更大利益而面临危险的人的敬重。赞成托尔姆的人相信，一个人的救赎可以通过服务找到，每一次失败都会削弱托尔姆，而每一次成功都会增加他的光辉。那些把托尔姆放在心上的人必须努力履行他的戒律，走向世界，成为一支积极的正义力量，纠正错误，帮助无望的人。他们必须努力维护和平与秩序，同时反对不公正的法律。托尔姆的追随者对腐败保持警惕，并被期望迅速而严厉地打击凡人心中的任何腐败证据。作为正义的剑臂，托尔姆的信徒被期望对背叛者进行快速的死亡。考虑到这些信条，大多数人类圣骑士将托尔姆作为他们的守护者就不足为奇了。",
	"Most temples dedicated to Torm are fortresses built on heights. These structures offer austere quarters for residents and visiting knights, drilling grounds, and stables. White granite, lion statues, and armored figures predominate in the architecture, with the coats of arms of fallen heroes decorating the walls of the great halls.": "大多数供奉托尔姆的寺庙都是建在高处的堡垒。这些建筑为居民和来访的骑士提供了简朴的住所、训练场和马厩。白色花岗岩、狮子雕像和盔甲人物在建筑中占主导地位，大殿的墙壁上还装饰着阵亡英雄的纹章。",
	"Torm is seen as the good right hand of Tyr, and a such his symbol is a white gauntlet made for the right hand. It represents Tyr's sword hand, but it is also a symbol of forbearance. Torm is frequently depicted with his right gauntlet extended palm forward, which worshipers call the Hand Resolute. It signifies the principle that the just and true must pause before acting to judge whether their intentions uphold Torm's ideals. Temples, civic structures, and the homes of the faithful are often decorated with images of the Hand Resolute as a constant reminder of this principle.": "托尔姆被看作是泰尔的好右手，因此他的象征是为右手制作的白色铠甲。它代表泰尔的剑手，但也是宽容的象征。托尔姆经常被描绘成右臂向前伸出的手掌，崇拜者称之为 \"坚定之手\"。它象征着这样一个原则：公正和真实的人在行动之前必须暂停，以判断他们的意图是否符合托尔姆的理想。寺庙、市政建筑和信徒的家中经常装饰着坚决之手的图像，以不断提醒人们注意这一原则。",
	"Worshipers of Torm come from most walks of life, for he welcomes any who seek the best in themselves and others, who uphold his tenets of loyalty, responsibility, duty, and kindness, or who are willing to sacrifice to keep evil from gaining ascendancy in the world. The faithful know that all of them will stumble from time to time while following in Torm's footsteps, but Torm's priests teach that the shame of a minor fall from grace is far less severe than declining to rise oneself up to Torm's standards.": "托尔姆的崇拜者来自各行各业，因为他欢迎任何在自己和他人身上寻求最好的人，维护他的忠诚、责任、义务和仁慈的信条，或者愿意为阻止邪恶在世界中占据优势而做出牺牲。信徒们知道，在追随托尔姆的脚步时，他们所有人都会时不时地跌倒，但托尔姆的牧师们教导说，轻微失足的耻辱远没有拒绝将自己提升到托尔姆的标准那么严重。",
	"lady luck, our smiling lady": "幸运女神，我们的笑脸",
	"Tymora is the bright-faced goddess of fortune, the one to whom gamblers and game-players pray in Faerûn. Our Smiling Lady is said to love none so much as those who gamble with the utmost skill and daring. Yet she is thought to watch over all who take risks to better their fortunes.": "泰莫拉是面容清秀的幸运女神，是法鲁恩的赌徒和游戏者所祈祷的对象。我们的微笑女神据说最爱的是那些以最大的技巧和胆量进行赌博的人。然而，人们认为她会照看所有为改善自己命运而冒险的人。",
	"The battle cry of the followers of Tymora is \"Fortune favors the bold.\" Someone might say words to Tymora before any endeavor in which a little good luck would help, but not when an incidence of bad luck might occur. (On such occasions folk pray to Beshaba to spare them from bad luck; praying to both is thought to anger both goddesses.) One common method of divining the future is to toss a coin to a stranger (typically a beggar) and ask if it's heads. If it is, the coin is left with the stranger as payment for Tymora's favor. If it's not, the stranger can choose to keep it (and the bad luck) or return it.": "泰莫拉的追随者的战斗口号是 \"命运眷顾大胆者\"。有人可能会在任何努力之前对泰莫拉说些话，因为在这些努力中，一点好运气会有所帮助，但在可能发生坏运气的时候则不会。(在这种情况下，人们会向贝沙巴祈祷，让他们免于厄运；向两位女神祈祷被认为会激怒两位女神）。一种常见的占卜方法是向陌生人（通常是乞丐）抛出一枚硬币，问其是否是正面。如果是，就把硬币留给陌生人，作为对泰莫拉的回报。如果不是，陌生人可以选择保留它（和坏运气）或归还它。",
	"Those who favor Tymora—as distinct from folk who invoke her name by mumbling over the dice—tend to be daring sorts. Adventurers and gamblers make up much of their ranks. They all have the belief that what is good about their lives is the result of having both good luck and the bravery to seek it out. Tymora has worshipers among all sorts of folk: the dashing young noble, the risk-taking merchant, the daydreaming field hand, and the scheming ne'er-do-well.": "那些喜欢泰莫拉的人--与那些通过对着骰子喃喃自语来呼唤她的名字的人不同--往往都是大胆的人。冒险家和赌徒占了他们队伍的大部分。他们都相信，他们生活中的美好事物都是拥有好运气和勇于寻找的结果。泰莫拉在各种人群中都有崇拜者：潇洒的年轻贵族、敢于冒险的商人、做白日梦的农夫，以及诡计多端的新手。",
	"Priests of Tymora and temples devoted to Lady Luck are scarce, since her faith tends not to stress a need for intermediaries: \"Let the lucky man and the Smiling Lady suss it out,\" as the old saying goes. Shrines to Tymora at gambling parlors aren't unusual, however, and sometimes such establishments attract a priest and effectively become temples.": "泰莫拉的牧师和致力于幸运女神的寺庙很少，因为她的信仰往往不强调对中介的需求。俗话说：\"让幸运的人和微笑的女士来解决这个问题\"。然而，在赌博场所中供奉泰莫拉的神龛并不罕见，有时这种场所会吸引一名牧师，并有效地成为寺庙。",
	"Before the Dawn Cataclysm, there was but one goddess of luck, Tyche. Ever flirting with fortune and disaster, Lady Luck bestowed and withdrew her favor at a whim. When her current paramour, Lathander, started a fight among the gods, Tyche kissed the Morninglord with misfortune and wandered off to explore the world.": "在黎明大灾变之前，只有一位幸运女神，泰切。幸运女神总是与财富和灾难调情，她随心所欲地赐予和收回她的恩惠。当她现在的姘头拉坦德（Lathander）在众神之间挑起争斗时，泰切以不幸的方式亲吻了晨曦之神，并漫步去探索世界。",
	"During her travels, Lady Luck discovered a budding rose of unequaled beauty. Delighted with this fortuitous happenstance, Tyche reached to pluck this delightful token, which she assumed was a peace overture from Lathander, who sought to regain her good graces. Much to her amazement, Lady Luck couldn't pluck the rose from its bush no matter how hard she tried. Frustrated, she cursed the rose with bad luck, and the flower's stem broke in her hands. Tyche put the plucked rose behind her ear and continued on her way. Unknown to Tyche, the rose was a manifestation of Moander, god of corruption and decay. The severed rose stem crept into Tyche's ear and subtly began to rot her from the inside out.": "在她的旅行中，幸运女神发现了一朵美丽无比的含苞待放的玫瑰。泰切对这一偶然事件感到高兴，伸手摘下了这朵令人愉快的信物，她认为这是拉坦德的和平姿态，他想重新获得她的好感。令她惊讶的是，无论她如何努力，幸运女神都无法将这朵玫瑰从花丛中摘下。沮丧之余，她诅咒这朵玫瑰不吉利，花茎在她手中折断。泰切把摘下的玫瑰放在耳后，继续走她的路。泰切不知道，这朵玫瑰是腐败和衰败之神莫安德的化身。被折断的玫瑰花茎悄悄地进入了泰切的耳朵，并巧妙地开始从里到外腐蚀她。",
	"When Tyche returned home, she came across her dear friend, the goddess Selûne, waiting to speak with her. Also waiting for her were Lathander, who wished to regain her affections, and Azuth, who had come to mediate the dispute between the two. Selûne wept great tears as she saw the corruption destroying her friend from within, and before Tyche could discern her intent, Selûne lashed out with a bolt of purifying light. Tyche's rotted core split down the middle and a smaller, brighter version of the goddess of luck stepped out, allowing the goddess of the moon to save that which was good and pure in her friend. However, following this first figure out of the rotten shell was another form stunning to behold, but full of dark malice and capricious ill will. As the two forms emerged, they immediately fell upon each other in hate, struggling madly, and were separated only by the combined efforts of all three visitors.": "当泰切回到家时，她遇到了她的挚友塞鲁恩女神，她在等着和她说话。等待她的还有希望重新获得她的感情的拉坦德，以及前来调解两人之间争端的阿苏特。当塞卢恩看到她的朋友被腐败从内部摧毁时，她流下了巨大的泪水，在泰切能够看出她的意图之前，塞卢恩用一道净化的光束打了出去。泰切腐烂的核心从中间裂开，一个更小、更明亮的幸运女神走了出来，让月亮女神拯救了她朋友身上的善与纯。然而，紧随这第一个人物走出腐烂的外壳的是另一个令人惊叹的形式，但充满了黑暗的恶意和反复无常的恶意。当这两个形体出现时，它们立即互相仇视，疯狂地挣扎着，只有在所有三个来访者的共同努力下才得以分开。",
	"It is said that Tymora, Tyche's Fair-Haired Daughter, embodies all the grace and kindness of her mother, while Beshaba, Tyche's Unpleasant Daughter, got only her looks. Since their birth, the twin aspects of Tyche—Tymora, Lady Luck, and Beshaba, Maid of Misfortune—have battled each other, contesting matters as great as the fate of nations and as small as the flip of a coin.": "据说泰莫拉，泰切的白发女儿，体现了她母亲所有的优雅和善良，而贝沙巴，泰切的不愉快的女儿，只得到了她的外表。自出生以来，泰切的双胞胎--幸运女神泰莫拉和不幸少女贝沙巴--一直在相互争斗，争夺大到国家命运，小到一枚硬币的翻转的问题。",
	"grimjaws, the maimed god, the evenhanded": "残缺的神灵，平凡的人",
	"Tyr Grimjaws, Tyr the Evenhanded, Wounded Tyr, the Maimed God, the Blind, Blind Tyr, the Lord of Justice—all of these names speak to the nature of the Faerûnian god of justice. Tyr appears as a noble warrior missing his right hand, which he lost to Kezef the Chaos Hound in an act of bravery and sacrifice, and with his eyes wrapped in cloth to signify his blindness, caused by a wound dealt to him by Ao when he questioned the justice of the Overgod's actions.": "Tyr Grimjaws, Tyr the Evenhanded, Wounded Tyr, the Maimed God, the Blind, Blind Tyr, the Lord of Just-all of these names speak to the nature of the Faerûnian god of justice. 泰尔作为一个高贵的战士出现，他的右手在一次勇敢和牺牲的行动中被混沌猎犬凯泽夫夺走，他的眼睛被布包裹着，象征着他的失明，这是因为他质疑超神行动的正义性时被奥打伤了。",
	"Tyr's followers devote themselves to the cause of justice, to the righting of wrongs and the deliverance of vengeance. This devotion isn't necessarily concerned with equality or fairness, but rather the discovery of truth and the punishment of the guilty. Those who favor Tyr tend to be stiff-necked about matters of theology and laws, seeing things in terms of black and white. Tyr's credo of lawfulness and honesty is a demanding one, and his priests remind the faithful not to hold in contempt others who can't live by it—it wouldn't be an honorable calling if everyone could muster the strength of will to follow it.": "泰尔的追随者致力于正义的事业，致力于纠正错误和传递复仇的力量。这种献身精神不一定与平等或公平有关，而是与发现真相和惩罚罪犯有关。那些支持泰尔的人往往对神学和法律的问题持僵硬态度，以黑白分明的方式看待问题。泰尔的合法和诚实的信条是一个苛刻的信条，他的牧师们提醒信徒们不要蔑视那些不能遵守信条的人--如果每个人都能鼓起意志力来遵守它，那就不是一个光荣的使命了。",
	"Many orders of knighthood are devoted to Tyr, including the Knights of Holy Judgment and the Knights of the Merciful Sword. Such knights-as well as judges and priests, clerics, and paladins who worship Tyr—sometimes wear thin strips of diaphanous cloth over their eyes to remind others of the blindness of justice.": "许多骑士团都献身于泰尔，包括神圣审判骑士团和仁慈之剑骑士团。这类骑士--以及法官和牧师、教士和崇拜泰尔的圣骑士--有时会在眼睛上戴上薄薄的布条，以提醒其他人注意正义的盲目性。",
	"the bitch queen, the queen of the depths, the wavemother": "贱人女王，深海女王，浪母",
	"No community that lives by the sea can ignore the influence of Umberlee, the furious goddess whose tempestuous nature reflects and is reflected by the waters of the deep. Any such community makes sure to host festivals to propitiate the Wavemother and seek her favor. Although mercurial in temperament, she can be generous to those who do her honor, as is any great queen.": "任何生活在海边的社区都不能忽视翁贝利的影响，这位愤怒的女神的暴躁天性反映了深海的水，也被深海的水所反映。任何这样的社区都一定会举办节日来祭祀波浪母亲，并寻求她的青睐。虽然性情多变，但她对那些为她服务的人却很慷慨，正如任何伟大的女王一样。",
	"The Bitch Queen is worshiped out of fear instead of adoration, and ship crews offer her gems, tossed over the side, to calm storm-tossed waters. As her most common moniker suggests, she is viewed as capricious and cruel with no firm ethical outlook; the sea is a savage place, and those who travel it had best be willing to pay the price of challenging her domain.": "人们对女巫的崇拜是出于恐惧，而不是崇拜，船员们把她的宝石扔到船舷上，以平息风暴带来的水灾。正如她最常见的名字所暗示的那样，她被视为任性和残忍，没有坚定的道德观；大海是一个野蛮的地方，那些旅行者最好愿意为挑战她的领域而付出代价。",
	"There is little in the way of an organized clergy of Umberlee. Her priests roam coastal cities, warning of doom and demanding free passage on ships in return for ensuring the goddess's pleasure. Often they wear the colors of waves and storms, and they decorate themselves with items that remind others of the sea's dangerous nature—a necklace of shark teeth, seaweed wrapped about a human bone, and so on. The preserved hand of a drowned person is thought to be a particularly holy object, and some of her few clerics use such severed hands as holy symbols. Umberlee does have a large number of shrines in the coastal cities, and sailors often leave flowers or small candies at them in hopes that she will spare them on their next voyage. Both Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate have true temples dedicated to Umberlee, staffed largely by the widows of sailors lost at sea.": "翁贝雷没有什么有组织的神职人员。她的祭司在沿海城市游荡，警告厄运，并要求船只免费通行，以确保女神的快乐。他们经常穿戴着海浪和风暴的颜色，并以提醒他人海洋危险性的物品来装饰自己--鲨鱼牙齿的项链，包裹着人骨的海草，等等。淹死的人保留下来的手被认为是特别神圣的物品，她的一些少数神职人员把这种断手作为神圣的象征。翁贝里在沿海城市确实有大量的神龛，水手们经常在神龛前留下鲜花或小糖果，希望她能在下一次航行中放过他们。沃特迪普和博德之门都有真正的神庙供奉着翁贝里，工作人员主要是在海上失踪的水手的遗孀。",
	"our lady of gold, the coinmaiden, the merchant's friend": "我们的黄金女士，硬币女郎，商人的朋友",
	"Waukeen is the goddess of wealth and trade, on both sides of the law. Her most ardent worshipers include shopkeepers, members of trading costers, wealthy merchants, caravan guides, itinerant peddlers, moneychangers, and smugglers. She is interested in anything that increases trade and the flow of money, whether new trade routes, new inventions, or the whim of changing fashion. Those who take Waukeen as a patron can be reliably thought of as greedy, but the Coinmaiden is said to frown upon misers and smile upon the industrious and the profligate, and thus priests who bear her holy symbol find themselves welcome in many towns and cities.": "沃基恩是财富和贸易的女神，在法律的两边。她最热心的崇拜者包括店主、贸易商成员、富有的商人、商队向导、流动的小贩、货币兑换商和走私者。她对任何能增加贸易和资金流动的东西都感兴趣，无论是新的贸易路线、新的发明，还是不断变化的时尚的心血来潮。那些以沃肯为赞助人的人可以被可靠地认为是贪婪的，但据说Coinmaiden对守财奴不屑一顾，对勤劳和挥霍的人微笑，因此，带有她神圣标志的牧师发现自己在许多城镇都很受欢迎。",
	"This chapter details many of the locales of the Sword Coast and the North, as seen through the eyes and recollections of a person living in Faerûn. Rather than being exhaustive descriptions, what follows are snippets of information drawn from the experience of five individuals who have traversed, lived in, and explored these areas. Like any other narrators, they have opinions and biases, and may be drawing conclusions from incomplete information. No one in the Realms knows everything about any subject, even its oldest and most learned sages, and the views formed from such incomplete information can often suggest an inaccurate conclusion. This is not to say that any of the information the narrators provide is false, only that they may not be entirely knowledgeable in their declarations.": "这一章详细介绍了剑海岸和北方的许多地方，是通过一个生活在法鲁恩的人的眼睛和回忆看到的。下面的内容不是详尽的描述，而是从五个曾经穿越、居住和探索这些地区的人的经验中提取的信息片断。与其他叙述者一样，他们也有自己的观点和偏见，并可能从不完整的信息中得出结论。在这个世界上，没有人对任何问题都了如指掌，即使是最古老和最博学的圣人，从这种不完整的信息中形成的观点往往会暗示出不准确的结论。这并不是说叙述者提供的任何信息都是错误的，只是说他们的声明可能不完全是知识性的。",
	"The details given here only begin to scratch the surface of the adventuring possibilities in the North. Although some of these locales are virtually unknown to outsiders, entire books longer than this one could be (and have been) written about others. If the descriptions leave you wanting to know more, consider them an inducement for you and your companions to visit these places and experience them firsthand.": "这里给出的细节只是开始了解北方冒险的可能性的表面。尽管其中一些地方几乎不为外人所知，但关于其他地方的书可以（而且已经）写得比这本书还长。如果这些描述让你想知道更多，那就把它们当作一种诱因，让你和你的同伴访问这些地方并亲身体验。",
	"Be aware, also, that there is a great deal more to the North than what is presented here. There are ruins without names, and settlements so small as to not even warrant mention in this tome. What lurks in the uncharted areas, waiting to tantalize or perhaps terrorize, is all the more formidable because it can't be anticipated.": "还要注意的是，北方的情况比这里所介绍的要多得多。这里有一些没有名字的废墟，还有一些小的定居点，甚至不值得在这本书中提及。潜伏在未知地区的东西，等待着挑逗或恐吓，因为无法预料，所以更加可怕。",
	"The information in this chapter is intentionally nonspecific with respect to threats, monsters, and statistics. While you can use these details to flavor your descriptions of the towns and cities your players might visit, you should in no way consider these pieces of narration definitive.

You're encouraged to take what's presented here and make it, and the Forgotten Realms, your own.": "你可能会决定改变一些细节，要么是为了让你的玩家感到惊讶，要么是为了说明在他们获得这里的信息后发生的事件。我们鼓励你把这里的内容变成你自己的，以及被遗忘的王国。",
	"For a century and a half, and more, the Lords' Alliance has stood as the most important and influential group in the north. Its power has kept towns safe from the predations of larger powers, has kept the ambitions of luskan in check, and has taught the rulers of many cities that it is better to cooperate, even for a time, then to merely shut one's doors and allow the storms to rage outside. It was this philosophy that led to the founding of Luruar, and when the lesson was lost, so too were the silver marches. But it serves no purpose to dwell on the folly of the past. Better instead to look to the future, repair the walls, and wait for word from the watching sentries.": "一个半世纪以来，领主联盟一直是北方最重要、最有影响力的团体。它的力量使城镇免受更大势力的掠夺，使卢斯坎的野心受到遏制，并使许多城市的统治者了解到，即使是在一段时间内，合作也比仅仅关起门来让外面的风暴肆虐要好。正是这种哲学导致了鲁鲁修的建立，而当这个教训消失后，银色的游行也随之消失了。但沉浸在过去的愚蠢中是没有意义的。更好的办法是着眼于未来，修复城墙，并等待监视的哨兵的消息。",
	"The Lords' Alliance isn't a nation unto itself, but a partnership of the rulers of towns and cities across the North, who have pledged peace with one another and promised to share information and effort against common threats such as orc hordes and Northlander pirates. It is a loose confederation of those settlements and their agents, all of whom owe allegiance first to their homelands, and second to the Lords' Alliance.": "领主联盟本身并不是一个国家，而是由整个北方的城镇统治者组成的伙伴关系，他们相互承诺和平，并承诺分享信息和努力，以应对共同的威胁，如兽人群和北地人的海盗。这是一个由这些定居点和他们的代理人组成的松散联盟，他们都首先效忠于自己的家乡，其次才是效忠于领主联盟。",
	"In the harsh lands of the North, where winters are cold and monsters and human barbarians regularly stream out of the mountains to pillage outlying settlements, large nations are rare indeed, particularly in the current state of the world. Instead, great city-states have emerged, enriched by trade and protected by stout walls and loyal defenders. Such cities—including Baldur's Gate, Mirabar, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, and Waterdeep—extend their influence into nearby regions, often creating or accepting vassal settlements, but in the end, these realms are cities, driven to consider their own protection and future before other concerns.": "在北方严酷的土地上，冬天很冷，怪物和人类野蛮人经常从山里出来掠夺外围的定居点，大国确实很少，特别是在目前的世界状况下。相反，伟大的城邦已经出现，它们因贸易而致富，受到坚固的城墙和忠诚的守卫者的保护。这些城市--包括博德之门（Baldur's Gate）、米拉巴尔（Mirabar）、永夜（Neverwinter）、银月（Silverymoon）和水底（Waterdeep）--将其影响力扩展到附近地区，经常创建或接受附庸定居点，但最终，这些王国都是城市，在考虑其他问题之前，都会考虑自己的保护和未来。",
	"In the years soon after its founding more than one hundred fifty years ago, there was more interest in membership, and the Alliance accepted some members from farther south. Since then, events such as the growth of Elturgard into a power in its own right, and the recent fall of the Silver Marches, have caused the group to draw in on itself, restricting its membership to powers in the North. The current members of the Alliance are Amphail, Baldur's Gate, Daggerford, Longsaddle, Mirabar, Mithral Hall, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Waterdeep, and Yartar. There is some doubt that Mithral Hall will be part of the alliance for much longer, but until rulership of the dwarven city is more firmly established, it remains a member.": "在一百五十年前成立后不久的几年里，人们对加入联盟有了更多的兴趣，联盟也接受了一些来自更南边的成员。从那时起，诸如艾尔图加德成长为一个大国，以及最近白银牧场的衰落等事件，使得该组织开始自我收缩，将其成员限制在北方的势力范围内。目前联盟的成员有：安菲儿、博德之门、达格福、长鞍、米拉巴尔、米特拉尔厅、永夜、银月、水底和雅塔尔。有些人怀疑米特拉尔厅会在更长时间内成为联盟的一部分，但在这个矮人城市的统治权更加稳固之前，它仍然是一个成员。",
	"It is impossible to ascribe an overall character to the individual members of the alliance. As a group, the agents of the members are interested in the preservation of civilization in the North, and they share what information they can—and oppose what threats they must—to further that goal. In the end, though, a merchant of Waterdeep and one of Baldur's Gate are concerned mainly for their own purses and the welfare of their home cities, and are unlikely to care what happens to the other, except inasmuch as it affects trade.": "不可能给联盟的个别成员赋予一个总体特征。作为一个团体，成员的代理人对保护北方的文明感兴趣，他们分享他们可以分享的信息，反对他们必须反对的威胁，以促进这一目标。但最终，水底城的商人和博德之门的商人主要关心的是他们自己的钱包和他们家乡城市的福利，不太可能关心对方的情况，除非它影响到贸易。",
	"The advice and insights in this section come from Andwe Cururen, a half-elf native of Silverymoon who was once a Knight in Silver (a member of the city's army), and now serves as an emissary and, when necessary, an active agent for the Lords' Alliance.

	"Named for its founder, a former warlord of Waterdeep, the small town of Amphail is home to just over seven hundred souls, yet it sought and received membership in the Lords' Alliance just under a century ago, thanks to the maneuverings of the noble families that control its lands. Where once it was simply an example of the extent of Waterdeep's reach, Amphail became the playground of that city's noble families, a place where they can scheme against their rivals and send their more rambunctious offspring to unleash some of their destructive tendencies without harming the family's reputation in proper society. As a result of being a member of the Lords' Alliance, Amphail is the equal of such great cities as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate in matters that concern the other powers of the region, despite its clear inferiority in size and strength.": "安菲勒小镇以其创始人--一位前沃特德普的军阀命名，只有七百多人，但就在不到一个世纪前，由于控制其土地的贵族家庭的操纵，它寻求并获得了领主联盟的成员资格。安菲勒曾经只是沃特德普影响力的一个例子，而现在却成了该市贵族家族的游乐场，他们可以在这里谋划对抗对手，并派他们更粗暴的后代去释放一些破坏性的倾向，而不会损害家族在正规社会的声誉。由于是领主联盟的成员，安菲勒在关系到该地区其他势力的事务上与永夜城和博德之门这样的大城市平起平坐，尽管它在规模和实力上明显逊色。",
	"Amphail's sovereignty means that, although patrols from the Waterdeep City Guard sometimes ride north to check on matters in Amphail, the only true authority in the town is the will of the noble families that control it. The primary business of Amphail is horse ranching, and the town is a fine place to find replacement mounts, and all manner of tack, bridle, feed, and other goods necessary to keep up one's horse. Most farms have farriers, or at least hands that can swiftly shoe a horse, and spare shoes all but litter the town.": "安菲勒的主权意味着，尽管沃特迪普城市卫队的巡逻队有时会骑马北上检查安菲勒的情况，但该镇唯一真正的权威是控制它的贵族家族的意愿。安普海尔的主要业务是养马，镇上是一个寻找替代坐骑的好地方，还有各种马具、辔头、饲料和其他养马所需的物品。大多数农场都有马夫，或者至少有一双能迅速给马穿鞋的手，而备用的鞋子在镇上随处可见。",
	"Visitors to Amphail often get a polite admonishment to \"mind the high born\" or \"ware silver saddles\" from the locals, but those who ignore such warnings should expect no help if they get into trouble with the nobility. Amphailans are by their nature suspicious of and quiet around folk who openly display wealth or status, having learned early in their lives that nobles are folk who like to throw their weight around, to the detriment of anyone nearby without enough coin or a grand enough title to stand up to them. I find that these common folk are ideal sources of information about the very people they distrust.": "来到安菲勒的游客经常会被当地人礼貌地告诫 \"注意那些高高在上的人 \"或 \"银色马鞍\"，但那些无视这些警告的人，如果遇到贵族的麻烦，就别指望得到帮助。安菲拉人天生就对那些公开展示财富或地位的人持怀疑态度，而且在他们的生活中很早就知道，贵族是喜欢四处张扬的人，这对附近没有足够的钱财或足够大的头衔来对抗他们的人来说是不利的。我发现这些普通人是关于他们不信任的人的理想信息来源。",
	"For their part, the young nobles that litter the town seem to make mischief mainly because they can. The feuds and rivalries that would generate only carefully worded insults in the city can escalate into brawls when these miscreants are far from the watchful eyes of their parents. Duels have long been prohibited by mutual agreement, due to the blood feuds they provoked in the past, but hands often drift to sword hilts when heated words are exchanged. Nearly every other sort of noble indiscretion is foisted on the residents of Amphail. Those who suffer property damage or worse at the nobles' hands are forced to forgive the offense in exchange for the application of coin or a promise made in the transgressor's name (suggesting that the youngster's relatives will handle any obligations). Some businesses survive entirely by bringing the comforts of Waterdeep to Amphail, creating gathering places where young nobles can feel at home.": "就他们而言，在镇上随处可见的年轻贵族们似乎主要是因为他们可以做恶作剧。在城市里只会产生小心翼翼的侮辱的仇怨和竞争，当这些捣蛋鬼远离他们父母的监视时，就会升级为斗殴。由于过去引发的血仇，决斗早已被双方协议禁止，但在激烈的言语交锋中，人们的手往往会移向剑柄。几乎所有其他类型的贵族轻率行为都被强加给了安菲勒的居民。那些在贵族手中遭受财产损失或更糟的人被迫原谅罪行，以换取使用硬币或以违法者的名义作出的承诺（暗示年轻人的亲属将处理任何义务）。一些企业完全是通过将沃特德普的舒适性带到安菲勒来生存的，创造了一些让年轻贵族感到宾至如归的聚会场所。",
	"The three greatest families with significant interests in Amphail are Houses Amcathra, Ilzimmer, and Roaringhorn; and most coin and business eventually passes through the hands one of those houses or its intermediaries. When Amphail joined the Lords' Alliance, these three houses were the loudest and most influential voices, and now control the rulership of the town, with the controlling family changing each Shieldmeet. The current Lord Warder is Dauner Ilzimmer, who speaks for the town to the Lords' Alliance. House Amcathra has yet to choose its successor for next Shieldmeet. Houses Jhansczil and Tarm have smaller breeding concerns in the area, and House Eagleshields has holdings near Amphail that it uses to continue its long tradition of caring for unhealthy animals from nearby farms, and offers fine tack and other gear for sale.": "在安菲儿有重大利益的三个最大的家族是Amcathra、Ilzimmer和Roaringhorn家族；大多数钱币和生意最终都要通过这些家族之一或其中间人的手中。当安菲儿加入领主联盟时，这三个家族是最响亮和最有影响力的声音，现在他们控制着该镇的统治权，控制的家族在每一次Shieldmeet上都会改变。目前的守卫长是道纳-伊尔齐默，他代表小镇向领主联盟发言。Amcathra家族还没有选择下一届Shieldmeet的继任者。Jhansczil和Tarm家族在这一地区有较小的育种问题，Eagleshields家族在Amphail附近有土地，用来延续其照顾附近农场的不健康动物的悠久传统，并提供精美的马具和其他装备供出售。",
	"Among the common folk, the Oglyntyr family has the largest and oldest cattle and horse farm in Amphail, and supplies some of the finest Amphail grays (loyal, intelligent steeds favored as personal mounts) to nobles and travelers in the region. A new family, not noble but possessing much wealth, has purchased the old Baldasker ranch. We suspect that the Hemzar family, who were unknown in either Amphail or Waterdeep before the purchase, like most of the mysterious matters in Amphail, may have the secret backing of one noble house or another.": "在普通民众中，奥格伦蒂尔家族拥有安菲勒最大和最古老的牛马场，并向该地区的贵族和旅行者提供一些最好的安菲勒灰马（忠诚、聪明的骏马，作为个人坐骑受到青睐）。一个不是贵族但拥有大量财富的新家庭购买了旧的Baldasker牧场。我们怀疑赫姆扎尔家族，在购买之前在安菲勒和沃特德普都不为人知，就像安菲勒的大多数神秘事件一样，可能有某个贵族家族的秘密支持。",
	"My contacts say the Oglyntyrs have petitioned the Ilzimmers to help crush this upstart business, a move that they are considering. I visited the Hemzar ranch, and I'd consider such a move inadvisable. A large family of Tashlutar descent, they seemed capable and confident of their position, despite my warning. I wasn't allowed the opportunity to explore the property fully, but I did note signs that the Hemzars are prepared to rear and train far more dangerous beasts than horses and cattle. I was then tempted to warn the Oglyntyrs, but that family can be as odious as the worst nobles. These things tend to sort themselves out.": "我的联系人说，奥格兰特人已经向伊尔兹默人请愿，要求他们帮助粉碎这个新起的企业，他们正在考虑这一行动。我访问了Hemzar牧场，我认为这样的举动是不可取的。这是一个有塔什鲁塔人血统的大家庭，尽管我提出了警告，但他们似乎很有能力，对自己的地位很有信心。我没有被允许有机会完全探索该财产，但我确实注意到一些迹象，表明赫姆扎尔人准备饲养和训练远比马和牛更危险的野兽。我当时很想警告奥甘特尔家族，但那个家族和最坏的贵族一样可恶。这些事情往往会自己解决。",
	"The noble families of Waterdeep who send their children to Amphail, or allow them to go there, hope that their sons and daughters will learn some lessons about life while away from Waterdeep. If they are going to cause damage or hurt feelings in the process, at least they will do so far away from the watchful eyes of the other nobility of the city. To the young nobles, there is no one in Amphail of any real consequence who might be permanently harmed by any improprieties. They also believe there is no one of note nearby to hear these hotheaded youngsters issue their boasts and proclaim their schemes—I have more than once learned of a threat simply by listening to children of different houses brag to one another about matters that were meant only for the family.": "沃特德普的贵族家庭把他们的孩子送到安普海尔，或者允许他们去那里，希望他们的儿子和女儿在离开沃特德普时能学到一些关于生活的教训。如果他们要在这个过程中造成损害或伤害感情，至少他们会在远离本市其他贵族的监视下这样做。对年轻的贵族们来说，在安普海尔没有任何真正有影响的人，他们可能会因为任何不当行为而受到永久性的伤害。他们还认为，附近没有人注意到这些头脑发热的年轻人发出的吹嘘和宣扬他们的计划，我曾不止一次地通过听不同家族的孩子们互相吹嘘只属于家族的事情来了解威胁。",
	"Aside from the excesses of its nobles, Amphail is a peaceful town, with the threat of full-scale retaliation from both Waterdeep and the Lords' Alliance casting a long, dark shadow over any plans to disturb matters there. The nobles of Waterdeep have heavy purses, and are willing to spend as much coin as necessary to protect their favored playground—and to punish anyone that might disrupt their control over it. The only thing the nobles don't seem to be able to spend away is the smell of manure, which in the summer months hangs thick over the town. It is that manure that helps to feed the true business of Amphail: feeding Waterdeep with the produce from the many farms that surround the town.": "除了贵族们的过度行为之外，安菲勒是一个和平的小镇，来自沃特德普和领主联盟的全面报复的威胁给任何扰乱那里的计划投下了漫长的黑暗阴影。沃特德普的贵族们有着沉重的钱包，他们愿意花费尽可能多的钱来保护他们喜爱的游乐场，并惩罚任何可能破坏他们对游乐场控制的人。贵族们唯一不能花掉的东西是粪便的味道，在夏天的几个月里，粪便的味道在小镇上空弥漫。正是这些粪便帮助养活了安菲勒的真正业务：用镇子周围许多农场的产品喂养沃特迪普。",
	"Because so many of Amphail's farms are owned by House Ammakyl, members of that noble family are by far the most enriched by the commerce there. They consider themselves good landlords to the folk that farm their lands, and are sure to bring any threats to honest, hard-working commoners to the attention of both the Lord Warder and the Lords of Waterdeep. Anything that threatens farming in Amphail threatens the City of Splendors directly, and such situations are dealt with swiftly and surely by the city's Guard. As a result, even the most rebellious nobles are careful not to tread too heavily on Ammakyl turf in Amphail, as a house that does so might swiftly find its favorite foods suddenly difficult to procure for a revel or some other event where the family's status is at risk.": "因为安菲儿的许多农场都属于阿玛基尔家族，所以到目前为止，该贵族家族的成员在那里的商业活动中是最富有的。他们认为自己是耕种土地的好地主，并且一定会将任何威胁到诚实、勤劳的平民的行为提交给看守大人和沃特德普的领主。任何威胁到安菲勒农业的行为都会直接威胁到辉煌之城，这种情况会被城市的卫队迅速而有效地处理。因此，即使是最叛逆的贵族也会小心翼翼地避免在安普海尔的安玛基尔地盘上踩上一脚，因为这样做的家族可能很快就会发现自己最喜欢的食物在狂欢或其他一些家族地位受到威胁的活动中突然难以采购了。",
	"On the Coast Way, some forty miles upstream along the River Chionthar from the Sword Coast, lies the bustling city of Baldur's Gate. Home to tens of thousands, the harbor city has poor soil, but its sheltered bay, well away from the tides that batter the coast, make it an ideal location for trading goods from locations to the west in the Sea of Swords, inland along the river, and up and down the coast. Baldur's Gate is a place of commerce, and the city enjoys great success handling the coins of other powers and making them its own.": "在海岸线上，从剑海岸沿奇安特河向上游约40英里处，坐落着繁华的博德之门城市。这座海港城市有数万居民，土壤贫瘠，但它有一个避风的海湾，远离冲击海岸的潮汐，使它成为从西边的剑海、内陆的河流和海岸的上下游进行货物交易的理想地点。博德之门是一个商业发达的地方，这个城市在处理其他国家的钱币并使之成为自己的钱币方面取得了巨大成功。",
	"Sadly, Baldur's Gate has a storied connection with the dark god, Bhaal. Just a few years ago, the city saw the terrifying return of the Lord of Murder. Following a number of deaths, one of the city's dukes, Torlin Silvershield, was revealed as the Chosen of Bhaal, and underwent a monstrous transformation, turning many citizens into bloodthirsty killers and inspiring a riot and much death before finally being put down by brave adventurers. Even now, murderous echoes ripple through the city and beyond, and reports of unexplainable, gruesome killings flow out of Baldur's Gate.": "可悲的是，博德之门与黑暗之神Bhaal有着不解之缘。就在几年前，这座城市看到了杀人魔王可怕的回归。在许多人死亡之后，该城的一位公爵，托林-西尔弗斯盾（Torlin Silvershield）被发现是巴哈尔的选民，并经历了一个可怕的转变，将许多市民变成了嗜血的杀手，激发了一场骚乱和许多死亡，最终被勇敢的冒险家们镇压。即使是现在，谋杀的回声在城市和其他地方荡漾开来，关于无法解释的、可怕的杀戮的报告从博德之门流出来。",
	"Baldur's Gate is ruled by the Council of Four, dukes who vote among themselves on matters of law and policy for the city. A single grand duke is chosen from among the four, and is empowered to break ties when the council is deadlocked. The current Grand Duke is Ulder Ravengard, who is joined by Dukes Thalamra Vanthampur, Belynne Stelmane, and Dillard Portyr, the former grand duke, who ceded the post to Ravengard after the city's recent troubles. Below the council sits the Parliament of Peers, a group of about fifty Baldurians who meet daily (though almost never in full number) to discuss the future of the city and recommend actions for the dukes to take on all matters, great and small. At any given time, roughly one-quarter of the peers are powerful members of Lower City society, with the rest drawn from the Upper City's noble families, called patriars.": "博德之门由四人议会统治，公爵们在城市的法律和政策问题上相互投票。从四人中选出一位大公，并有权在议会陷入僵局时打破僵局。现任大公是乌尔德-拉文加德，与他一起的还有塔拉姆拉-范坦普尔公爵、贝林恩-斯特尔曼恩公爵和迪拉德-波蒂尔公爵，前大公在该市最近的麻烦之后将职位让给了拉文加德。议会下面是议员会议，一个由大约50名鲍杜尔人组成的小组，他们每天开会（尽管几乎从不满员），讨论城市的未来，并就所有大小事务向公爵们建议采取的行动。在任何时候，大约有四分之一的议员是下城社会的有权势的成员，其余的来自上城的贵族家庭，称为元老。",
	"Defense of the Upper City is handled by the Watch, the official constabulary of the city's elite. Their duty is to defend the patriars and enforce their laws, and little else. For the rest of Baldur's Gate, security is enforced and order maintained by the Flaming Fist mercenary company, a supposedly neutral force which is free to fight in external conflicts, so long as it doesn't side against Baldur's Gate. By tradition, the highest officer of the Flaming Fist is one of the city's dukes, and Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard fulfills that tradition proudly. Membership in the Flaming Fist is fairly easy to achieve, and adventurers with much experience swiftly advance in rank (and, consequently, political influence) once they become permanent members. Many ranking officers are former adventurers who have \"retired\" to military life.": "上城的防御工作由守望者负责，他们是城市精英的官方警察。他们的职责是保卫元老们，执行他们的法律，除此之外没有其他任务。对于博德之门的其他地区，安全由火焰之拳雇佣兵公司执行，秩序由其维持，这是一支所谓的中立部队，只要不站在博德之门一边，就可以在外部冲突中自由作战。按照传统，火焰之拳的最高官员是该城的公爵之一，而大公Ulder Ravengard自豪地履行了这一传统。火焰之拳的成员资格相当容易获得，拥有丰富经验的冒险者一旦成为永久成员，就会迅速提升等级（以及随之而来的政治影响力）。许多高级军官都是以前的冒险家，他们已经 \"退休\"，过上了军事生活。",
	"In both the Upper and Lower Cities, the underworld is controlled by a shadowy group known merely as the Guild. The dukes don't acknowledge the power of this group in any meaningful way—at least not publicly—but try (at least nominally) to curb its influence where and how they can. I lost count of how many gangs claim territory in the Lower and Outer City, and all of them seem to owe allegiance to the Guild. Efforts to destroy the Guild have thus far failed, due in part to the inability of outsiders to identify a clear leader of the group, but in no small measure to the shameful lack of effort on the part of the rulers of the city to protect its people.": "在上城和下城，黑社会都被一个仅被称为公会的阴暗团体所控制。公爵们不以任何有意义的方式承认这个组织的力量--至少不公开承认--但他们试图（至少在名义上）在可能的地方和方式上遏制其影响。我已经数不清有多少帮派在下城和外城宣称拥有领土，而他们似乎都效忠于公会。到目前为止，摧毁公会的努力已经失败了，部分原因是外人无法确定该组织的明确领导人，但在很大程度上是由于城市的统治者没有努力保护其人民，这是令人羞愧的。",
	"The Upper City of Baldur's Gate is the enclosed haven of the city's nobility—the patriars. Sitting atop their hill, the patriars look down on the rest of Baldur's Gate in every real sense, wielding their wealth and influence to push the Council of Four to protect their lifestyle. Though at one time a wealthy merchant or powerful adventurer might hope to advance to the ranks of the patriars, there is no longer room, physically or otherwise, for the class of the Upper City to grow. Now, only those born into the patriar families inhabit the manors of this oldest part of Baldur's Gate. The poorest among these go so far as to sell furnishings and decorations from inside their homes in order to keep up appearances with their fellow patriars.": "博德之门的上城是城市贵族的封闭天堂--族长们。坐落在山顶上的族长们从各种实际意义上俯视着博德之门的其他地方，利用他们的财富和影响力来推动四人议会保护他们的生活方式。虽然曾经有一个富裕的商人或强大的冒险家可能希望晋升到族长的行列，但现在已经没有空间了，无论是身体上还是其他方面，上层城市的阶级已经不再增长。现在，只有那些出生在族长家族的人居住在博德之门这个最古老的地区的庄园里。这些人中最穷的人甚至卖掉了家里的家具和装饰品，以保持他们的同族的形象。",
	"Most would say that the lives of patriars are marked by luxury and decadence, and for a great many of them, this is likely true. However, some families do make an honest attempt at improving the city, and nearly every family has at least one member who engages in major commerce—no matter one's heritage, everyone must have coin in order to eat. There is but one nonhuman family among the patriars, the dwarven Shattershields, who have been in Baldur's Gate for long enough that they are just as accomplished as their human peers at looking down on the rest of the citizenry.": "大多数人会说，爱国者的生活以奢侈和颓废为标志，对他们中的许多人来说，这可能是事实。然而，有些家庭确实为改善城市做出了真诚的尝试，而且几乎每个家庭都至少有一个成员从事主要的商业活动--不管一个人的遗产如何，每个人都必须有硬币才能吃饭。在族长中只有一个非人类家族，即矮人Shattershields家族，他们在博德之门已经有足够长的时间，以至于他们和他们的人类同龄人一样善于看不起其他公民。",
	"A number of gates divide the Upper City from the Lower City, but the one to note is the famous Baldur's Gate, from which the city takes its name. Trade passes only through this gate, and is taxed by the city—despite the fact that it was just such taxes that led to the city's being overthrown by its first dukes and the Lower City enclosed by its ring wall. The other gates exist solely for the convenience of the patriars and their retinues. Any who aren't in the presence of a patriar, wearing a patriar's livery, or bearing a letter of proof of employment by a patriar must use Baldur's Gate to pass between the Upper and Lower Cities. Bear this in mind when trying to sneak from one part of the city to the next.": "许多门将上城和下城分开，但最值得注意的是著名的博德门，城市的名字就来源于此。贸易只通过这道门，并由城市征税--尽管正是这样的税收导致城市被第一批公爵推翻，下城被环形墙包围。其他城门的存在只是为了方便族长和他们的随从。任何没有族长在场、没有穿着族长制服、没有携带族长雇佣证明信的人，都必须使用Baldur门在上城和下城之间通行。在试图从城市的一个部分潜入到另一个部分时，请记住这一点。",
	"Hard against the harbor lies the Lower City, where stone, slate-roofed houses stand (sometimes unsteadily), and the folk who have long performed the real work of the city reside. Baldur's Gate depends on trade, and that trade flows in and out of the Gray Harbor. The hands that load and unload ships, that tally cargo and haul goods, that repair keels and mend sails, all live here. The damp clings heavily in this portion of the city—some say it's held in by the Old Wall—and lamps (lit and filled by citizens, not the city) pierce the fog. Most locals are wise enough to carry lanterns or lamps, and visitors that have not learned to do so can usually hire a young Baldurian to guide them through the streets.": "靠着港口的地方是下城，那里矗立着石头、板条屋顶的房屋（有时是不稳定的），居住着长期从事城市真正工作的人们。博德之门依赖于贸易，而贸易则是在灰色港湾里进进出出。装载和卸载船只的人，统计货物和运输货物的人，修理龙骨和修补船帆的人，都住在这里。在城市的这一部分，湿气很重--有人说它被老墙挡住了--而灯（由市民点燃和填充，而不是城市）穿透了雾气。大多数当地人都有足够的智慧来携带灯笼或灯具，而没有学会这样做的游客通常可以雇用一个年轻的Baldurian来引导他们穿过街道。",
	"The Lower City was long ago walled in to benefit from the protection of the city, but the divide between the two wards is as stark as it has ever been. The Flaming Fist is responsible for keeping order in the Lower City, and do so with brutal efficiency, deterring most from engaging in bold, public acts of theft, vandalism, or violence.": "下城在很久以前就被围起来，以便从城市的保护中获益，但两个区之间的鸿沟还是一如既往的明显。火焰之拳负责维持下城的秩序，并以残酷的效率维持秩序，阻止大多数人参与大胆的、公开的盗窃、破坏或暴力行动。",
	"Where merchants in other cities might hope to one day join the nobility, in Baldur's Gate the best one can hope for is to become an absurdly wealthy and influential merchant. Becoming a patriar is out of the question. Still, the wealthiest Baldurians live as much like the patriars as they can, buying up adjacent properties in the hopes of demolishing them in order to build large homes to echo the manors of the Upper City. The Bloomridge district has a number of such homes, and some of the patriars grumble that these merchants are growing too comfortable with their new status.": "其他城市的商人可能希望有一天能加入贵族行列，而在《博德之门》中，人们最好的希望是成为一个荒谬的富有和有影响力的商人。成为一名族长是不可能的。不过，最富有的Baldur人还是尽可能地过着和元老们一样的生活，他们买下邻近的房产，希望能把它们拆掉，以便建造大型住宅，与上城的庄园相呼应。布卢姆里奇区有许多这样的房子，一些爱国者抱怨说，这些商人对他们的新地位越来越满意了。",
	"Outside the walls, there are no laws barring construction or settlement, and so those who are too poor to reside within the city or to purchase property have slowly built up a third ward of the city, living in the shadow of its walls, paying its taxes, and covering both sides of the roads leading into Baldur's Gate. Here, the poorest of the poor live in the Outer City, but so too do those whose businesses are considered too troublesome, noisy, or foul-smelling to operate within the walls, so tanners, smiths, masons, dyers, and other tradesfolk abound. The city does woefully little to help the folk here, and charitable souls (myself included) sometimes start at one end of the road with a full purse, only to see it empty by the time they reach the other end.": "在城墙外，没有任何法律禁止建筑或定居，因此那些太过贫穷而无法在城内居住或购买房产的人慢慢地建立了城市的第三区，生活在城墙的阴影下，缴纳城墙税，并覆盖通往博德之门的道路两侧。在这里，最穷的人住在外城，但那些被认为在城墙内经营太麻烦、太吵、太臭的人也住在外城，所以制革工人、铁匠、泥瓦匠、染匠和其他商人比比皆是。城市对这里的人们的帮助少得可怜，慈善家们（包括我自己）有时会带着满满的钱包从路的一端开始，但当他们到达另一端时却发现钱包已经空了。",
	"The lack of laws in the Outer City has led to two strange phenomena, unrelated to one another. A walled Calishite district has grown up to the east of the city proper, known by Baldurians as Little Calimshan. Within the district, neighborhoods are divided by walls, but these walls have walkways atop them so that foot traffic can proceed unimpeded by the gates that slow carts and mounts. Here, refugees from Calimshan have found a home away from that southern nation, and largely depend on themselves for trade, culture, and defense.": "外城缺乏法律，导致了两个奇怪的现象，彼此之间没有关联。在城市的东部，一个有墙的卡利希特区已经发展起来，被Baldurian称为小卡利姆山。在这个地区，居民区被城墙分割开来，但这些城墙上面有人行道，因此，步行交通可以不受减缓马车和坐骑的城门的阻碍。在这里，来自卡里姆山的难民找到了一个远离南方国家的家，他们主要依靠自己的贸易、文化和防御。",
	"Buildings have also been constructed along Wyrm's Crossing over the Chionthar. Shops, taverns, and tenements choke the bridge, hanging from both spans, and even in some cases built to hang from the supports that hold it up. Folk must pay a toll to cross on foot or by cart or wagon, but many swear they would pay yet more to be able to use the bridge without having to dodge the hawkers and urchins that infest the area.": "沿着奇安特河上的维尔姆十字路口也建起了建筑物。商店、酒馆和租房扼杀在桥上，悬挂在两个跨度上，甚至在某些情况下，建在支撑它的支架上。民众必须支付通行费才能步行或乘车或马车过桥，但许多人发誓他们会支付更多的钱来使用这座桥，而不必躲避侵扰该地区的小贩和顽童。",
	"Built against the side of a low hill on the floodplains of the Delimbiyr, this small, walled town is dominated by the keep of the local duchess, Lady Morwen Daggerford. Counting the town itself and the nearby hamlets and farms that look to it for protection and guidance, some twelve hundred people call the area home. Lady Morwen is the sister of the previous duke, Maldwyn Daggerford, and she seems a capable and charismatic leader. The Daggerford family's authority over the area dates back to the ancient Kingdom of Man that succeeded Phalorm in the region. Though that realm has been dust for centuries, there are those that see Daggerford as the last bastion of a better time of peace, wealth, and influence—a time that, given the right leadership, has the smallest of chances of being restored.": "这座有围墙的小城建在德林拜尔河洪泛区的一座低矮山丘边上，由当地公爵夫人莫文-达格福特女士的城堡主导。算上小镇本身以及附近的小村庄和农场的保护和指导，大约有一千二百人把这个地区当作自己的家。莫文夫人是前任公爵马尔德温-达格福特的妹妹，她似乎是一个有能力、有魅力的领导者。Daggerford家族对该地区的权力可以追溯到在该地区接替Phalorm的古老的人类王国。虽然那个王国已经尘封了几个世纪，但有些人将Daggerford视为和平、财富和影响力的美好时代的最后堡垒--如果有正确的领导，这个时代有最小的机会被恢复。",
	"Daggerford is a pastoral haven. Wide, sprawling hills nearby offer peaceful vistas, but are sometimes overrun by raiding orcs or goblins. The frequent caravans heading north to Waterdeep or south to Baldur's Gate need escort or guarding, and can offer news of both of those cities (and the settlements between them). Several inns stand ready to accept visitors, except in the busiest of trade or festival periods, when they fill swiftly, and many locals open up their homes to lodgers. Warriors in need of coin can help their purses by offering their services as trainers for the local militia, or accompanying the town guard on its patrols.": "Daggerford是一个牧民的天堂。附近宽阔无垠的山丘提供了宁静的视野，但有时会被突袭的兽人或哥布林侵占。经常有商队向北前往沃特迪普（Waterdeep）或向南前往博德之门（Baldur's Gate），需要护送或守卫，并能提供这两个城市（以及它们之间的定居点）的消息。除了在最繁忙的贸易或节日期间，有几家旅店随时准备接受游客，这时他们会迅速坐满，许多当地人会向住宿者开放他们的家。需要钱的勇士们可以通过为当地民兵提供训练员的服务来帮助他们的钱包，或者陪同镇上的卫队进行巡逻。",
	"Daily rulership is in the hands of the Council of Guilds, composed of the heads of the town's informal trade groups. These guildmasters believe themselves more powerful and influential than they truly are, imitating the Lords of Waterdeep by going robed and masked to council meetings. This charade, in the eyes of most, borders on farce, as everyone in Daggerford knows precisely who the council members are, and no magic disguises the forms, voices, or mannerisms of the guild leaders, and a trained spy can learn which guildmaster is which after only an evening or two of proper observation.": "日常统治权掌握在行会理事会手中，该理事会由该镇的非正式贸易团体的负责人组成。这些行会会长认为自己比实际情况更强大，更有影响力，他们模仿水底世界的领主，穿着长袍，戴着面具参加理事会会议。在大多数人眼里，这种戏法近乎于闹剧，因为在达格福德的每个人都清楚地知道谁是理事会成员，没有任何魔法可以掩盖公会领导人的形态、声音或举止，一个训练有素的间谍只需经过一两个晚上的适当观察就能知道哪个公会会长是谁。",
	"The largest and oldest building in Daggerford is the ducal castle, a three-level keep enclosed by a two-story wall that contains its own smithy, a wide parade ground, and stabling for a large number of animals. The dukes of Daggerford have always kept a well-stocked larder, capable of feeding the castle's inhabitants and any citizens that might shelter inside during a siege.": "达格福最大和最古老的建筑是公爵城堡，这是一个由两层墙围起来的三层堡垒，里面有自己的铁匠铺，一个宽阔的阅兵场，以及大量动物的马厩。Daggerford的公爵们一直保持着一个充足的储藏室，能够喂饱城堡的居民和任何在围攻期间可能躲在里面的公民。",
	"Three gates lead into the town of Daggerford: River Gate, which provides access to the river, and through which shipping cargo is carted into the town proper; Caravan Gate, which handles most landgoing traffic, including land-based trade; and Farmers' Gate, which remains open at nearly all times, but is wide enough only to let one wagon or cart pass at a time.": "有三道门通往达格福特镇。河门是通往河边的通道，航运货物通过河门进入小镇；大篷车门负责处理大多数陆路交通，包括陆路贸易；农夫门几乎在任何时候都是开放的，但其宽度只够一次让一辆马车或小车通过。",
	"A militia guards Daggerford. Militia service is mandatory for all able-bodied adults, and lasts for twenty years. All citizens living within the town receive instruction from the duchess's own soldiers in the use of spears and other weapons, and must spend at least one day a month in defense of the town, standing sentry on its walls or patrolling the nearby roads. Their training means that the common citizens of Daggerford aren't easily cowed by armed folk demanding goods, coin, or passage, and are slightly more likely to take up work as mercenaries, caravan guards, or adventurers.": "一支民兵队守卫着Daggerford。所有身体健康的成年人都必须参加民兵服务，持续时间为20年。所有住在镇上的公民都要接受公爵夫人自己的士兵的指导，学习如何使用长矛和其他武器，并且每个月必须至少花一天时间来保卫城镇，在城墙上放哨或在附近的道路上巡逻。他们的训练意味着Daggerford的普通市民不会轻易被要求提供货物、硬币或通行证的武装分子吓倒，他们更有可能从事雇佣兵、商队守卫或冒险家的工作。",
	"Although she is less amiable than her brother was, Lady Morwen is acknowledged as more capable of ruling Daggerford than Duke Maldwyn had been. She is well liked by the people, who understand that she has an honorable heart, and wishes what is best for Daggerford. She regularly trains with the militia, and is seen in the town wearing armor just as often as she is adorned in the finery befitting her station. She often visits the local shrine to Tempus, which only enhances her reputation as a pious woman. Lady Morwen's features are only now starting to age, as though catching up with her white hair.": "虽然她没有她哥哥那么和蔼可亲，但莫文夫人被公认为比马尔德温公爵更有能力统治达格福。她深受人们的喜爱，人们明白她有一颗可敬的心，并希望为达格福特带来最好的东西。她经常与民兵一起训练，在镇上经常看到她穿着盔甲，就像她穿着适合她地位的衣服一样。她经常拜访当地的Tempus神庙，这只会提高她作为一个虔诚女人的声誉。莫文夫人的五官现在才开始衰老，仿佛赶上了她的白发。",
	"Most folk of Daggerford know one another, at least casually, by sight. Strangers are usually welcome, especially if they have coin to spend, unless such folk come armed and belligerent through the town. Guards stationed at each gate make note of new faces, but don't take action against those they don't recognize unless they are given reason to do so.": "Daggerford的大多数人都互相认识，至少是随便看看。陌生人通常是受欢迎的，特别是如果他们有硬币可以花，除非这些人带着武器和好战的态度穿过小镇。驻扎在各大门的卫兵会注意到新面孔，但除非有理由，否则不会对那些他们不认识的人采取行动。",
	"The largest of the town's inns, the River Shining Tavern, is the second biggest building in Daggerford, and the site of many local celebrations and gatherings. Here, the wealthy come to eat and relax. The inn is old—many locals claim it to be older even than the ducal castle—and to many, is the very soul of Daggerford. The Silver Flood Inn and Lizard's Gizzard also offer rooms, though the latter has no food to provide its guests, only beds.": "镇上最大的客栈--闪亮河酒馆，是达格福特第二大建筑，也是当地许多庆祝活动和聚会的场所。在这里，富人会来吃饭和放松。这家客栈很古老，许多当地人声称它甚至比公爵城堡还要古老，对许多人来说，它是达格福的灵魂。银色洪水旅馆和蜥蜴之胗也提供房间，尽管后者没有食物提供给客人，只有床。",
	"One of Daggerford's most unusual businesses is the Sword Coast Traders' Bank, which accepts deposits from traveling merchants and enables them to receive these funds at a similar location in either Waterdeep or Baldur's Gate. Lady Belinda Anteos (of the Waterdeep noble house) promises that her business is secure and that the bank's magical means of communicating precise amounts of currency between cities can't be tampered with.": "Daggerford最不寻常的业务之一是剑岸商人银行，它接受旅行商人的存款，并使他们能够在Waterdeep或Baldur's Gate的一个类似地点收到这些资金。贝琳达-安特欧斯女士（沃特迪普贵族家族）承诺她的生意是安全的，银行在城市间传递精确货币数量的神奇手段是无法被篡改的。",
	"Members of local guilds that do business outside the town don't entirely trust the Traders' Bank, preferring instead to borrow coin from the Hardcheese family of halflings that run the Happy Cow tavern. The Alliance officially has no preference, but I find Lady Anteos trustworthy enough to be an alternative to carrying large sums on the road. It's easier to part with a small portion of one's purse than to lose everything to a band of brigands during a journey through the wilds.": "在镇外做生意的当地行会成员并不完全信任商人银行，而是更愿意从经营快乐牛酒馆的半身人哈德奇斯家族那里借钱。联盟官方并无偏好，但我发现安特奥斯女士值得信赖，足以成为携带大笔资金上路的一个选择。与其在荒野的旅途中被一伙强盗夺走所有的东西，不如把钱包里的一小部分分出来。",
	"Visitors to Daggerford are advised both to avoid the tannery to the west and to swiftly cross Tyndal's Bridge when approaching from the south. The tannery's location, up on the hill, does little to contain the stink of the process, and the Watermen's Guild dumps the city's waste over the side of the bridge. On hot days, the scents exuded from both sites can be overwhelming, which is why I have again asked the Alliance to assign a different agent to visit on next summer's rounds.": "建议来到达格福的游客避开西边的制革厂，并在从南边来的时候迅速穿过丁达尔桥。制革厂的位置在山上，几乎无法抑制制革过程中的臭味，而水手公会则将城市的垃圾倾倒在桥的一侧。在炎热的日子里，这两个地方散发的气味会让人难以忍受，这就是为什么我再次要求联盟指派一名不同的代理人在明年夏天的巡视中访问。",
	"Tyndal's Bridge is a low stone structure over which travelers pass when approaching from the west, where a local boy named Tyndal held off a number of lizardfolk with only a dagger. He grew to manhood, married the local ruler's daughter, named himself duke, and built Daggerford atop the ruins of an older castle. This story, and most of the area's history, is happily related to any who ask by Sir Darfin Floshin, an elf older than Daggerford itself. He longs to see a rise in cooperation between humans, dwarves, and elves in the region, such as was once embodied in the realm of Phalorm. Darfin has been advisor to many dukes of Daggerford through the years. Though he was rebuffed by Duke Maldwyn during his reign, there are signs that Lady Morwen may be more receptive to the advice of a gold elf who has witnessed the fall of the human kingdom of Delimbiyran, the founding of Daggerford, and all the days since.": "丁达尔桥是一个低矮的石头结构，旅行者从西边走过来时都要经过这个桥。当地一个叫丁达尔的男孩在那里只用一把匕首就挡住了许多蜥蜴人。他长大成人，娶了当地统治者的女儿，自封为公爵，并在一座古老城堡的废墟上建造了Daggerford。这个故事，以及这个地区的大部分历史，都由达尔芬-弗洛辛爵士愉快地告诉任何询问的人，他是一个比达格福特本身更古老的精灵。他渴望看到人类、矮人和精灵之间的合作在这个地区的兴起，就像曾经体现在Phalorm王国中的那样。多年来，Darfin一直是Daggerford的许多公爵的顾问。虽然他在马尔德温公爵统治期间被他回绝了，但有迹象表明，莫文夫人可能更容易接受一个金精灵的建议，他见证了人类王国德林拜伦的衰落、达格福的建立，以及此后的所有日子。",
	"The hamlet of Longsaddle is little more than a row of buildings on either side of the Long Road, halfway along the lengthy journey from Triboar to Mirabar. A path leaves the road here and winds to the Ivy Mansion, the great house of the wizards of the Harpell family. Since the Harpells founded the town more than four centuries ago, they have brooked little nonsense and less mayhem. Their own behavior sometimes borders on the bizarre and can be disturbing—they once turned two rival sects of Malarites into rabbits for disturbing Longsaddle with their squabbles, leaving them at the mercy of the predators they had honored—but they are one of the most potent gatherings of mages anywhere in the North.": "长鞍村只不过是长路两边的一排建筑，在从特里波尔到米拉巴尔的漫长旅程的中途。一条小路在这里离开公路，蜿蜒至常春藤大厦，这是哈佩尔家族的巫师的大房子。自从哈佩尔家族在四个多世纪前建立这个小镇以来，他们几乎没有容忍过任何胡言乱语，更没有容忍过混乱。他们自己的行为有时近乎怪异，而且可能令人不安--他们曾经把两个敌对的马拉里派教徒变成了兔子，因为他们的争吵扰乱了龙鞍，使他们不得不听从他们所尊敬的掠食者的摆布--但他们是北方任何地方最有力的法师聚会之一。",
	"The Harpells are a jovial, if insular, lot. All wizards, they tend to marry wizards as well, and the elder women of the family (by blood or marriage) set the course for the house and utterly rule matters within the Ivy Mansion. The family takes on a number of apprentice wizards, using them for menial tasks and for basic defense of Longsaddle. Some apprentices are often the inadvertent test subjects for an experimental spell, but such is the danger of apprenticing to the Harpells. It is likely this spirit of experimentation that caused the Harpells to found their town so far away from other settlements. Young wizards with oddly sized or shaped limbs, strange hair color, or shifting forms are fairly common sights in Longsaddle, not surprising to locals though they might give visitors pause.": "哈珀尔家族是一个欢快的，甚至是孤僻的群体。他们都是巫师，也倾向于与巫师结婚，家族中的长者（通过血缘或婚姻）为家族设定了方向，并完全统治了常春藤大厦内的事务。该家族招收了一些巫师学徒，用他们来做一些琐碎的工作，以及对长沙的基本防御。一些学徒往往是实验性法术的无心试验对象，但这就是向哈珀尔家族学徒的危险。很可能正是这种实验精神导致哈佩尔人在远离其他定居点的地方建立了他们的城镇。肢体大小或形状奇特、头发颜色怪异或形态多变的年轻巫师在龙鞍镇相当常见，对当地人来说并不奇怪，但他们可能会让游客感到不安。",
	"Given the Harpells' reputation as powerful wizards, and the sheer number of them, there is no shortage of folk poking around Longsaddle and the nearby lands hoping to discover caches of magic, hidden like children's treasures. Of course, few, if any, such bundles exist, but the locals draw no shortage of entertainment from sending would-be thieves on grand chases for wands, rings, and other magic trinkets that any prudent person would realize simply don't exist. After all, if the average trader in Longsaddle knew where powerful magic was located, he would be more likely, down the years, to try to claim it.": "鉴于哈佩尔人作为强大的巫师的名声，以及他们的数量，不乏有民间人士在龙鞍和附近的土地上打探，希望发现像儿童宝藏一样藏匿的魔法。当然，这样的包袱即使有也是少之又少，但当地人不乏娱乐活动，让那些可能的小偷大肆追逐魔杖、戒指和其他魔法饰品，而任何谨慎的人都会意识到这些东西根本不存在。毕竟，如果Longsaddle的普通商人知道强大的魔法在哪里，他就会更有可能在这些年里试图索取它。",
	"The primary business of Longsaddle is ranching, and the lands surrounding the village are dominated by hundreds of ranches and farms of every sort and size, from tiny horse farms to great fields of cattle. During those days that livestock are brought in for trading, Longsaddle is a dusty, noise-filled place, with the sounds of the animals competing with the shouts of farmers hoping to sell their goods.": "Longsaddle的主要业务是放牧，村子周围的土地被数以百计的各种类型和规模的牧场和农场所占据，从小小的马场到大片的牛场。在牲畜被运来交易的那些日子里，Longsaddle是一个尘土飞扬、充满噪音的地方，动物的声音与希望出售货物的农民的喊叫声相互竞争。",
	"At all other times, it's a quiet, almost sleepy hamlet, except when the booming reverberation of a Harpell-crafted spell breaks the silence. The family is constantly researching magic both old and new, and twisting spells and rituals into interesting (to them) innovations. This proclivity has prompted them to surround Ivy Mansion with as many magical wards as the family can muster, in order to protect the populace from an errant explosion, terrifying illusion, or the odd, galloping horse of lightning speeding by.": "在其他时候，这里是一个安静的、几乎令人昏昏欲睡的小村庄，除非是哈珀尔制作的咒语的轰鸣回响打破了这种寂静。该家族不断研究新旧魔法，并将咒语和仪式扭曲成有趣的（对他们来说）创新。这种癖好促使他们在常春藤大厦周围设置了家族所能容纳的尽可能多的魔法屏障，以保护民众不受错误的爆炸、可怕的幻觉或奇怪的、飞驰而过的闪电之马的影响。",
	"Several businesses designed to attract travelers stand in Longsaddle, if for no other reason than travel along the well-named Long Road can be tiresome. The first is the Gilded Horseshoe, an old inn to the west of the road that serves fine food and drink, offers comfortable beds, and is close enough to the Ivy Mansion that no one would dare disturb it or its guests. The owners have access to some of the choicest cuts of meat in Longsaddle, and as a result, their roasts and stews are exquisite.": "有几家旨在吸引旅行者的企业矗立在龙鞍镇，如果没有其他原因的话，沿着名字好听的长路旅行会让人感到厌烦。首先是镀金马蹄铁，这是一家位于路西的古老旅馆，提供精美的食物和饮料，提供舒适的床铺，而且离常春藤大厦足够近，没有人敢打扰它或它的客人。店主可以获得龙须沟一些最优质的肉类，因此，他们的烤肉和炖肉都非常精致。",
	"Across the road, the Ostever family serves as the local slaughterer and butcher for folk wishing to take meat, rather than live animals, away from Longsaddle. Rumor holds that the sausages have much improved down the years but buyers are advised to \"mind the tusks\" by locals, a reference to an old joke that none remember. Folk willing to wait can have the able hands of the Ostevers perform a slaughter, hanging, dressing, and packing for them, though this process is likely to take days longer than most travelers can spare.": "在马路对面，奥斯特弗家族是当地的屠宰商和屠夫，为希望从龙须沟带走肉类而不是活体动物的人们服务。有传言说，这些年来，香肠的质量有了很大的提高，但当地人建议买主 \"注意牙齿\"，这指的是一个古老的笑话，但没有人记得。愿意等待的人可以让奥斯特夫家的能手为他们进行宰杀、悬挂、穿衣和包装，尽管这个过程可能要比大多数旅行者的时间长几天。",
	"There is entertainment to be had at the Gambling Golem, where cheaters in the card or dice games are tossed out into the street, and a local marbles game known as scattershields is popular. Dry goods, candles, lanterns, saddles, rope, and wagon wheels are available from a number of other shops.": "在赌神那里有娱乐活动，在纸牌或骰子游戏中作弊的人被扔到街上，而当地一种被称为散弹的弹珠游戏也很受欢迎。其他一些商店还提供干货、蜡烛、灯笼、马鞍、绳子和马车车轮。",
	"It can't be stressed enough that while the Harpells have little interest in the daily running of Longsaddle, it is undeniably their town. They rarely suffer insults, and never tolerate violence against themselves, their family, or the locals. A conflict involving the Harpells is likely to end swiftly and bloodily, and (unless the offender is convincingly apologetic, unconscious, dead, or forgiven of the wrongdoing) will often draw additional Harpells to support their kin. Harpell supports Harpell in all public matters, and no one bothers to record the numbers and names of those that forgot that fact.": "怎么强调都不为过的是，虽然哈珀尔家族对龙须沟的日常运作兴趣不大，但不可否认的是，这是他们的城镇。他们很少受到侮辱，也从不容忍针对他们自己、他们的家人或当地人的暴力。涉及哈佩尔人的冲突很可能迅速而血腥地结束，而且（除非犯罪者令人信服地道歉、昏迷、死亡或被原谅了错误行为）往往会吸引更多的哈佩尔人来支持他们的亲属。哈珀尔在所有公共事务中都支持哈珀尔，没有人愿意记录那些忘记这一事实的人数和名字。",
	"Aside from the Harpells, the dominant families of Longsaddle are ranchers: the Cadrasz, Emmert, Kromlor, Mammlar, Sharnshield, Suldivver, and Zelorrgosz families have ranched in or near Longsaddle for generations, and influence most of the daily life there. They set the market days, help resolve disputes among families, and broker purchases when a farmer or businessperson dies without an heir. They settle smaller matters and keep the peace as best they can, knowing full well that if the Harpells need to get involved in a dispute, there is always the possibility of an offender's being blasted into nothingness.": "除了哈佩尔家族之外，龙萨德的主要家族都是牧场主：卡德拉斯兹、埃默特、克罗姆勒、马姆拉、沙恩斯盾、苏尔迪弗和泽罗尔戈斯家族世代在龙萨德或附近从事牧场经营，并影响着那里大部分的日常生活。他们确定集市日，帮助解决家庭之间的纠纷，并在农民或商人死后没有继承人的情况下充当购买的中介。他们尽可能地解决小事并维持和平，他们清楚地知道，如果哈珀尔家族需要介入争端，总有可能将犯罪者炸成一片虚无。",
	"These families are also the ones most likely to hire outsiders to deal with matters on the ranches, whether an orc raid or the appearance of lycanthropes in the area (though it's rumored that the latter creatures may be the descendants of one of the Harpells). The major ranching interests often hire adventurers not only to further their own aims or provide for defense, but to secretly hinder or harm one another and gain an advantage in their ongoing competition. Adventurers that go too far on such a mission can be explained away as foolish outlanders, and if they offend a Harpell and get blasted in the middle of the Low Road, there will be no one left to ask about the matter. My best advice is to be mindful of the scent of magic in the air and act accordingly.": "这些家族也是最有可能雇佣外人来处理牧场事务的家族，无论是兽人的突袭还是该地区出现的狼人（尽管有传言说后一种生物可能是哈珀尔家族的后代）。主要的牧场利益集团经常雇用冒险者，不仅是为了促进他们自己的目标或提供防御，而且是为了秘密地阻碍或伤害对方，在他们正在进行的竞争中获得优势。在这种任务中走得太远的冒险者可以被解释为愚蠢的外乡人，如果他们得罪了哈佩尔，在低级道路中间被炸死，就没有人可以询问此事了。我最好的建议是注意空气中的魔法气味并采取相应的行动。",
	"Mirabar is a human city that rests atop dwarven caverns. On the surface, humans dominate the population, with some dwarves mixed in, and a handful of gnomes and halflings. The uppermost level of the undercity is mostly dwarves, with some few humans. The mixing of races is due to convenience of trade, preference, or skill; just as some few humans like to mine, to imbibe strong dwarven drink, and to work underground, so do a minority of dwarves take to the open sky, doing dock work, or even manning and building ships. The lower levels beneath Mirabar are all dwarven, as even the most dwarf-like human can live so deep below ground for only so long. Almost all of its citizens, regardless of race, honor Moradin and the dwarven gods, making Mirabar a dwarven city in spirit and ethics, if not entirely by population, much in the way my own Silverymoon speaks to elven ideals of natural beauty.": "米拉巴尔是一座人类城市，坐落在矮人的洞穴之上。在表面上，人类占主导地位，一些矮人混杂其中，还有少数地精和半身人。城下的最上层主要是矮人，还有一些少数人类。种族的混合是由于贸易的便利、偏好或技能；就像一些少数人类喜欢采矿、喝浓烈的矮人饮料和在地下工作一样，少数矮人也喜欢在空旷的天空下，从事码头工作，甚至是操纵和建造船只。米拉巴尔地下的低层都是矮人，因为即使是最像矮人的人类也只能在地下深处生活这么久。几乎所有的市民，不论种族，都尊敬莫拉丁和矮人之神，使米拉巴尔在精神和道德上成为一个矮人城市，如果不完全是人口的话，就像我自己的银月城对自然美景的理想一样。",
	"Long ago, the great dwarven kingdom of Gharraghaur stood to the west of Delzoun, delving mines near the River Mirar and finding great, near-endless veins of gems. Like many of the dwarven realms, Gharraghaur fell to marauding orcs, which destroyed the kingdom and its capital city but couldn't take advantage of the wealth therein. For millennia the lower city lay empty, until some eight hundred years ago, when Prince Ereskas of Amn settled the same spot, creating the city of Mirabar (coincidentally echoing the dwarven \"-bar\" naming convention used for citadels throughout the North). It was only when dwarves returned to work the mines below that Mirabar began to see its fortunes increase.": "很久以前，伟大的矮人王国Gharraghaur矗立在Delzoun的西部，在Mirar河附近挖掘矿藏，发现了巨大的、近乎无尽的宝石矿脉。就像许多矮人王国一样，加拉豪尔落入了掠夺性的兽人手中，他们摧毁了王国和首都，却无法利用其中的财富。几千年来，下层城市一直空荡荡的，直到大约八百年前，安恩的王子埃瑞斯卡斯在同一地点定居，建立了米拉巴尔城（巧合的是，这与整个北方的矮人\"-巴 \"的命名惯例相呼应）。只有当矮人回到下面的矿场工作时，米拉巴尔才开始看到它的财富增长。",
	"Mirabar is ruled by its hereditary marchion, Selin Raurym, who issues edicts fed to him by the Council of Sparkling Stones. The council is a group of dwarves and some few humans elected to make policy for the city, who determine where the output of Mirabar's mines will be sold. Although the council has long kept Mirabar associated with the Lords' Alliance, it is the marchion who negotiates with his fellow lords. Thus far, Selin Raurym has proved far more capable than his predecessors at making beneficial decisions for the city, and the council has given him great leeway to speak for Mirabar outside the walls. His threat to pull out of the Alliance following its failure to aid the northern cities against the most recent orc hordes, though considered by some an empty gesture, has brought Mirabar more advantageous relationships with Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate, something which has not gone unappreciated by the council.": "米拉巴尔由其世袭酋长塞林-劳瑞姆（Selin Raurym）统治，他发布由闪光石议会提供给他的法令。议会是由矮人和少数人类组成的团体，他们被选举出来为城市制定政策，决定米拉巴尔的矿场的产出将被卖到哪里。虽然理事会长期以来一直让米拉巴尔与领主联盟保持联系，但与领主同伴谈判的是马奇恩。到目前为止，塞林-劳瑞姆已经证明在为城市做出有益的决定方面比他的前任要强得多，议会也给了他很大的余地在城墙外为米拉巴尔说话。在联盟未能帮助北方城市对抗最近的兽人群之后，他威胁要退出联盟，虽然有些人认为这是一个空洞的姿态，但却为米拉巴尔带来了与水底城和博德之门更有利的关系，这一点并没有得到议会的赞赏。",
	"The city's guard, the Axe of Mirabar, exists primarily to deter and prevent sabotage of the mines, without which Mirabar would collapse. The guard also provides swift and capable defense and law enforcement within the city. The wealth of Mirabar is so great that it maintains docks, ships, and fortified harbors on many of the islands in the Sea of Swords, and as such the city is always seeking magical and military support for these defenses. Where other cities might use such vast mountains of coin as Mirabar possesses on shows of prosperity, Mirabarrens use it for more functional goals, making sure that the city's defenses are new, that its gates close securely when they are moved, that its buildings and walls are strong and secure. Given the recent destruction of Sundabar's surface city at the hand of orc armies, such expenditures are well justified, since no one in Mirabar wishes to see the surface city wiped out. It would simply be bad for business. Mirabar spares no expense in defending its wealth, and hires as many mages and adventurers as necessary to clear threats away from roads, investigate sabotage, and otherwise protect its vital trade.": "城市的卫队，米拉巴尔之斧，主要是为了阻止和防止对矿场的破坏，没有它，米拉巴尔将崩溃。警卫队还在城市内提供迅速而有力的防御和执法。米拉巴尔的财富是如此之大，以至于它在剑海的许多岛屿上都有码头、船只和坚固的港口，因此，该城市一直在为这些防御措施寻求魔法和军事支持。其他城市可能会将米拉巴尔拥有的如此庞大的硬币山用于显示繁荣，而米拉巴尔人则将其用于更多的功能目标，确保城市的防御系统是新的，其大门在移动时能安全地关闭，其建筑和墙壁是坚固和安全的。鉴于桑达巴尔的地面城市最近被兽人军队摧毁，这种支出是合理的，因为米拉巴尔没有人希望看到地面城市被消灭。这对商业来说是很不利的。米拉巴尔不遗余力地捍卫自己的财富，并在必要时雇佣尽可能多的法师和冒险家来清除道路上的威胁，调查破坏行为，并以其他方式保护其重要贸易。",
	"With the rise of Mithral Hall in the last century, and now Gauntlgrym, Mirabar fears its place as the armory of the North is at risk. The miners, smelters, and smiths of Mirabar work ever harder to increase their output and improve their craft, while the jewelers and enamelers study ways to incorporate ancient techniques of melding dwarven, human, and elven designs together in their work, in the manner of old Phalorm.": "随着Mithral Hall在上个世纪的崛起，以及现在Gauntlgrym的出现，Mirabar担心它作为北方军械库的地位会受到威胁。米拉巴尔的矿工、冶炼师和铁匠们更加努力地工作，以提高他们的产量和改进他们的工艺，而珠宝商和珐琅师则研究如何在他们的作品中融入古老的技术，将矮人、人类和精灵的设计融合在一起，就像古老的法隆一样。",
	"Mirabarren (or to some, just Mierren) dwarves like to cultivate long, wide (as opposed to tapered or pointed) beards and tight braids of hair growing elsewhere than on the chin, a fashion copied by some local humans. They love polished, everbright-treated sheets of metal, particularly copper, used as doors or mirrorlike wallpanel inlays. They often set gems into the pommels and nonworking ends of tools and weapons. Mierren dwarves tend to be wealthy, to have personal collections of unusual and rare gems, to use seals made of gems carved into signet rings, and to be investors in ventures (rather than property) up and down the Sword Coast. They are sophisticated and worldly, and they decry the isolationist and xenophobic attitudes of some dwarves. Mierren dwarves demonstrate their own broader attitudes by being the diplomatic traders and power brokers in trademoots and agreements in Fireshear and Neverwinter and everywhere else they can worm their way into, among dwarves and between dwarves and non-dwarves.": "米拉巴伦（或对一些人来说，只是米尔伦）矮人喜欢培养长而宽（而不是锥形或尖形）的胡须，以及在下巴以外的其他地方生长的紧身辫子，这种时尚被一些当地人类所模仿。他们喜欢抛光的、经过常亮处理的金属片，特别是铜片，用作门或镜子般的墙板镶嵌。他们经常在工具和武器的鞍座和非工作端镶嵌宝石。米尔伦矮人往往很富有，拥有不寻常的稀有宝石的个人收藏，使用宝石雕刻成的印记，并且是剑海岸上下的企业（而不是财产）的投资者。他们成熟而世故，他们谴责某些矮人的孤立主义和排外主义态度。米尔伦矮人通过在火星和永夜以及其他任何他们能够以蠕虫方式进入的地方，在矮人之间以及矮人和非矮人之间成为商标和协议的外交商人和权力经纪人，来证明他们自己更广泛的态度。",
	"To other dwarves, Mierren are translators and local guides and \"the people who know the right people\" in human-dominated cities everywhere along the Sword Coast and in much of the Heartlands. Most adult Mierren have dealings with a variety of human costers and merchants, taking care to avoid exclusivity or cultivate too narrow a range of business partners and contacts, so they control their own destinies and fortunes. They abhor the thought of humans having the slightest chance of dominating them.": "对于其他矮人来说，米伦是翻译和当地向导，以及在剑海岸和心脏地带大部分地区的人类主导的城市中 \"认识正确的人 \"的人。大多数成年的米伦人都与各种人类造价师和商人打交道，注意避免排他性或培养范围过窄的商业伙伴和联系人，因此他们控制着自己的命运和财富。他们憎恨人类有丝毫支配他们的机会的想法。",
	"The wealth that flows through Mirabar has not only extended the reach and worldly knowledge of all Mierren, it has enabled them to indulge all sorts of personal hobbies, such as art collections (statuettes and paintings in particular). The private living quarters of most Mierren feature comfortable furniture, painted artwork large and small, statuary, and hanging chimes—often metallic, but always soft and pleasant, never loud or strident. Gems are plentiful in Mierren families and are used as currency and in all manner of personal adornment, rather than being hidden away. Semiprecious stones line many of the streets in Mirabar, and gorgeous inlays mark important corners and intersections, some so new that one can still smell the jeweler's dust.": "流经米拉巴尔的财富不仅扩大了所有米勒人的影响力和世俗知识，还使他们能够沉迷于各种个人爱好，如艺术收藏（尤其是雕像和绘画）。大多数米伦人的私人生活区都有舒适的家具、大大小小的绘画艺术品、雕像和悬挂的风铃--通常是金属的，但总是柔和宜人，从不喧哗或刺耳。宝石在米尔伦家庭中非常多，被用作货币和各种个人装饰品，而不是被藏起来。米拉巴尔的许多街道上都有半宝石，华丽的镶嵌物标志着重要的角落和交叉口，有些是如此新，以至于人们还能闻到珠宝商的灰尘。",
	"Still, despite the city's overall wealth, there are rich and (relatively) poor Mirabarrans. Not everyone shares in the coin the city's sales bring in, and wage workers whose income is determined by a day's labor or a month's output can't hope to expect that a well-worded contract by an employer will enrich them in the least. Wealthy merchants and business owners are careful not to show their success ostentatiously; their clothing might be of richer fabrics, but still in the same styles and colors as the garb of poorer folks. Waiting rooms and front halls in the fortified homes of the rich are just as sparsely furnished as those in poorer homes. Keeping up the appearance of relative equality in fortunes is vital, for if anyone in a position to commit a violent act—say, a weaponsmith with access to great stores of swords and axes—knew just how wealthy the wealthiest Mirabarrans were, there would very likely be bloodshed before the offended parties were satisfied.": "然而，尽管这个城市总体上很富裕，但还是有富裕的和（相对）贫穷的米拉巴兰人。不是每个人都能分享城市销售带来的钱财，那些收入由一天的劳动或一个月的产出决定的工薪族，不能指望雇主的一份措辞得当的合同能使他们获得丝毫的财富。富裕的商人和企业主都小心翼翼地避免炫耀他们的成功；他们的衣服可能是更丰富的面料，但仍然是与穷人的服装一样的款式和颜色。富人家的候车室和前厅与穷人家的候车室和前厅一样，都是家具稀少的。保持财富相对平等的外观是至关重要的，因为如果任何有能力实施暴力行为的人--例如，能够获得大量剑和斧头的武器制造商--知道最富有的米拉巴兰人是多么富有，在被冒犯的各方得到满足之前，很可能会发生流血事件。",
	"The dwarves were the first to discover the secret of treating their metal with everbright. The technique has been imitated by other races, to varying degrees of success. Armor, weapons, and other metal objects to which everbright is applied maintain their luster without needing to be polished, and are resistant to natural (and, in some cases, magical) pitting, rusting, and tarnishing.": "矮人是第一个发现用常光处理金属的秘密的人。这种技术已经被其他种族所模仿，并取得了不同程度的成功。盔甲、武器和其他金属物品在使用常亮剂后，无需抛光就能保持光泽，并能抵抗自然（以及在某些情况下，魔法）的点蚀、生锈和褪色。",
	"A short while ago, Neverwinter was beset by all manner of damage, danger, and gloom. Now, the orcs that once menaced the city have moved east to join their brethren in being crushed by the dwarves. The Chasm that rent the land has been sealed by powerful magic. The High Road has been cleared and rebuilt, and trade has resumed with Waterdeep and realms to the south. What was the blasted, wounded city of Neverwinter just a decade ago is now an exciting, humming place, where folk seem eager to throw off the hardships from which they have emerged and create a new, brighter future for their city.": "不久前，永夜城还被各种破坏、危险和阴霾所困扰。现在，曾经威胁着这座城市的兽人已经向东移动，与他们的兄弟们一起被矮人击溃。撕裂土地的鸿沟已被强大的魔法封住。高路已经被清理和重建，与水底世界和南方王国的贸易已经恢复。十年前的永夜城是一个被炸毁的、受伤的城市，现在则是一个令人兴奋的、嗡嗡作响的地方，那里的人们似乎渴望摆脱困境，为他们的城市创造一个新的、更光明的未来。",
	"Nearly half a century ago, Mount Hotenow (the nearby volcano that perpetually heats the river flowing through the city) violently erupted, destroying much of Neverwinter, killing thousands, and leaving in its wake a great, gaping chasm that split the city. Neverwinter was in ruins, and external influences—from Netheril to Thay to Lord Dagult Neverember of Waterdeep to the agents of the Hells themselves—sought to exert control over the city. Many folk fought to stem all these dangers, and eventually, a measure of peace fell over Neverwinter.": "近半个世纪前，霍特诺山（附近的火山，永远加热着流经城市的河流）猛烈爆发，摧毁了永夜城的大部分地区，杀死了数千人，并在其身后留下了一条巨大的、分裂城市的鸿沟。永夜城成了一片废墟，外来的影响--从尼瑟尔到泰伊，到水底城的达古特-永夜城主，再到地狱的代理人，都想对这座城市施加控制。许多人为了阻止这些危险而战斗，最终，永夜城获得了一定程度的和平。",
	"Since Dagult Neverember was deposed as the Open Lord of Waterdeep, he has thrown his full attention and effort into the rebuilding of the city from which he claims descent. Whatever people's opinions are of his claim to Neverwinter's throne, he has proven a capable, inspiring leader over these last few years, and the population has embraced him as Lord Protector. He engineered the sealing of the Chasm and the restoration of the High Road, and is seeking other ways to repair and improve the city. Even if he can never prove his descent from Lord Nasher Alagondar, the people of Neverwinter have accepted his leadership. (My rumored personal dislike of Lord Neverember has nothing to do with my assessment of his leadership; I merely find him an intolerable flirt.)": "自从达古特-纽伦堡被废黜为沃特德普的公开领主后，他就把全部的注意力和精力都放在了重建这个他自称有血统的城市。无论人们对他在永夜的王位有什么看法，在过去的几年里，他已经被证明是一个有能力的、鼓舞人心的领导者，人们也拥护他成为保护者。他设计了鸿沟的封印和大道的恢复，并正在寻求其他方法来修复和改善城市。即使他无法证明自己是纳舍-阿拉贡达大人的后裔，永夜城的人们也接受了他的领导。(传闻中我对永夜城主的个人厌恶与我对他的领导力的评价无关，我只是觉得他是个令人无法容忍的花花公子。)",
	"Neverember's influence radiates outward from the Protector's Enclave, centered at the Hall of Justice. With Tyr restored to life and his worship returning to prominence, the Lord Protector has moved into a modest, private villa. This sacrifice—and the renewal of Tyr's faith in the previous center of his operations—is only further proof, to some, that Neverember deserves to rule Neverwinter. As yet, Castle Never remains a dangerous ruin, but Neverember has plans to reclaim and rebuild it as a symbol of the city's rejuvenation.": "Neverember的影响力从以正义殿堂为中心的保护者飞地向外辐射。随着泰尔恢复了生命，他的崇拜也恢复了显著的地位，保护者大人已经搬进了一个简陋的私人别墅。这一牺牲--以及泰尔对他以前的行动中心的重新信任--在一些人看来，这只是进一步证明了永夜城值得统治永夜城。到目前为止，永无堡仍然是一个危险的废墟，但永无堡已经计划将其收回并重建，作为城市复兴的象征。",
	"The faithful of Oghma have arrived in Neverwinter to restore the House of Knowledge to its former glory, but beyond that, shrines to all manner of gods have been cobbled together in every corner of the city.": "奥格玛的信徒们来到永夜城，将知识之家恢复到昔日的辉煌，但除此之外，在城市的每个角落都有各种神灵的神龛被拼凑起来。",
	"As the city restores itself, there are likely to be requests for ennoblement and the privileges that provides, and certainly, trading interests will emerge. But Lord Protector Neverember is sure to point out that he is merely a protector, not a king, and so can't invest or recognize anyone. Guilds may form, but it is sure to be years, if not decades, before any prove strong enough to persevere over their rivals.": "随着城市的自我恢复，很可能会有人要求封爵和提供特权，当然，贸易利益也会出现。但保护者Neverember大人肯定会指出，他只是一个保护者，而不是国王，所以不能投资或承认任何人。行会可能会形成，但肯定要经过几年，甚至几十年的时间，才能证明有足够强大的力量来战胜他们的对手。",
	"Increasingly, calls come from the citizenry for the enforcers out of Mintarn to be replaced by respectable, local guards who have a personal interest in the defense of Neverwinter. This public sentiment has led to some neighborhoods organizing their own makeshift militias, and the Lord Protector wants to avoid conflict between them and the mercenaries he has hired. As a result, Neverember has slowly been drawing down the number of soldiers from Mintarn, as the citizens that grew up defending the makeshift Wall from threats out of the Chasm prove themselves capable of becoming a proper military force. Both Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep have offered to help train the new guards of Neverwinter, but Lord Neverember prefers the assistance of seasoned adventurers to the ignominy of seeking help from his former city.": "越来越多的市民要求将执法者从敏塔恩（Mintarn）调走，由值得尊敬的、对保卫永冬有个人兴趣的当地卫兵取代。这种公众情绪导致一些社区组织了自己的临时民兵，而保护者大人希望避免他们与他所雇佣的雇佣兵之间发生冲突。因此，纽伦堡一直在慢慢减少来自敏塔恩的士兵数量，因为那些在保护临时长城免受鸿沟威胁中长大的公民证明自己有能力成为一支合适的军事力量。博德之门（Baldur's Gate）和沃特德普（Waterdeep）都表示愿意帮助训练永夜城的新守卫，但永夜城主更喜欢经验丰富的冒险家的帮助，而不是向他以前的城市寻求帮助的耻辱。",
	"With the restoration of nearby Gauntlgrym, Neverwinter hopes to have a close ally that can provide it with stout armor and strong weapons. Although the city presently has little to offer, trade activity is rapidly growing in Neverwinter, as word of its rebirth opens it up to shipping from the Sea of Swords, goods from the north, and coin from the south. Adventurers come to Neverwinter seeking work and following rumors of nearby treasures, and often find additional employment clearing out dangerous corners of the city and escorting the ever more numerous caravans up and down the High Road. It is the Lord Protector's hope that, with commerce and income both on the rise, and talented craftfolk returning to ply their trades, that Neverwinter will someday again be worthy of its former epithet: the City of Skilled Hands.": "随着附近Gauntlgrym的恢复，Neverwinter希望能有一个亲密的盟友，为它提供坚固的盔甲和强大的武器。虽然这个城市目前没有什么可提供的东西，但贸易活动在永夜迅速增长，因为它的重生让它向来自剑海的航运、北方的货物和南方的硬币开放。冒险家们来到永夜城寻找工作，并听从附近宝藏的传言，他们经常找到额外的工作来清理城市的危险角落，并护送越来越多的商队在公路上来回穿梭。守护者大人希望，随着商业和收入的增加，以及有天赋的手工艺人回到他们的行业，永温特有一天会再次配得上它以前的称号：巧手之城。",
	"Opposition to Neverember's authority still exists, but with no unified leadership and no other power in the city to which to appeal, the rebels are slowly turning away from their resistance and toward helping the city rebuild. Many of the Sons of Alagondar, a rebel group that initially opposed Lord Neverember, have begun to volunteer as replacements for the Mintarn mercenaries currently patrolling the city. If the Sons of Alagondar can be brought into line with his goals, Neverember hopes to use that achievement as a draw for wealthy Waterdhavian nobles—who have been reluctant to link their fortunes to a failed Open Lord who was effectively exiled from Waterdeep—to invest in the city and perhaps rebuild some of the noble villas in that district as places for them to stay when they do business.": "对Neverember的权威的反对仍然存在，但由于没有统一的领导，在城市中也没有其他的力量可以呼吁，叛军正在慢慢地从他们的抵抗中转向帮助城市的重建。许多阿拉贡达之子（Sons of Alagondar），一个最初反对纽伦堡勋爵的反叛组织，已经开始自愿替代目前在城市里巡逻的明塔恩雇佣兵。如果阿拉贡达之子能够与他的目标保持一致，纽文伯希望利用这一成就来吸引富裕的沃特达威贵族--他们不愿意将自己的财富与一个实际上被流放出沃特德普的失败的开放领主联系在一起--来投资这座城市，也许可以重建该地区的一些贵族别墅，作为他们做生意时的住处。",
	"With the Chasm closed, and the wall that separated the rest of the city from its horrors now torn down, a great swath of Neverwinter lies empty, with no inhabitants and plentiful chunks of stone plundered from ruins all across the city. Anyone who is willing to do so can come to this area, claim a portion of land, and build a structure in which to live or work. There aren't yet any guilds to restrict trade or construction, and no nobles to be petitioned or placated. Those seeking to create a home or start a business can simply do so, and even those without skills or money can use their hands and backs to provide until they can set up a place for themselves.": "随着鸿沟的关闭，将城市其他地方与恐怖之地隔开的墙现在被拆毁了，永夜城的大片土地空空如也，没有居民，有的是从整个城市的废墟中掠夺来的大块石头。任何愿意这样做的人都可以来到这个地区，拥有一部分土地，并建造一个可以居住或工作的建筑。这里还没有任何行会来限制贸易或建筑，也没有任何贵族需要被请愿或安抚。那些想要建立一个家或开始一个生意的人可以简单地这样做，甚至那些没有技能或金钱的人可以用他们的手和背来提供，直到他们能够为自己建立一个地方。",
	"Along the river, many of the merchant villas are being claimed and restored by folk who have heard rumors of what Neverwinter once was, and might be again. Some have no skills to speak of, and many have no wealth, but all come with the desire to work and to enrich themselves in the process. New stores and workshops open by the tenday, and workers without training offer their services as laborers or apprentices; those that fail move on to other employment, taking advantage of the multitude of opportunities the city now offers. Those with no other options can get work dredging or mapping the city's sewers for the Lord Protector, a task made necessary by the cataclysm that created the Chasm.": "沿着河边，许多商人的别墅都被那些听说过永夜曾经是什么，并可能再次成为什么的传闻的人认领和修复。有些人没有任何技能可言，许多人也没有财富，但他们都有工作的愿望，并希望在这个过程中充实自己。新的商店和工场按天开张，没有受过训练的工人提供他们的服务，成为工人或学徒；那些失败的人利用这个城市现在提供的大量机会，转而从事其他工作。那些没有其他选择的人可以为保护者大人疏浚或绘制城市的下水道，这项任务是由造成鸿沟的大灾难所引起的。",
	"Like any city, Neverwinter isn't without its drawbacks. Though most folk are willing to work, some steal as a means of making their living, and prey upon those who have little to be taken. Food is sometimes scarce, as inns and taverns underestimate the number of guests they will receive, or merchants simply run out of goods to sell. It's likely to be a few years before the city entirely shakes itself of these ills, but for some, the uncertainties of life in Neverwinter are what make the place exciting. For many traders, in particular those who produce or vend the grains and vegetables needed in the city, it is a vast opportunity to both aid a fledgling power and get quite rich in doing so.": "和其他城市一样，永夜城也不是没有缺点的。虽然大多数人都愿意工作，但有些人以偷窃为生，并掠夺那些没有什么可拿的东西。由于旅馆和酒馆低估了他们将接待的客人的数量，或者商人根本没有货物可卖，所以食物有时会很稀缺。在这个城市完全摆脱这些弊病之前，可能还需要几年的时间，但对一些人来说，永夜城生活的不确定性使这个地方变得令人兴奋。对于许多商人来说，特别是那些生产或销售城市所需的谷物和蔬菜的人来说，这是一个巨大的机会，既可以帮助一个新生的势力，又可以在此过程中获得相当的财富。",
	"Long a powerful and influential member of the Lords' Alliance—and, for its entire existence, the Silver Marches of Luruar—Silverymoon is what many cities aspire to be: a quiet, peaceful realm, where many races live together for common knowledge, celebration, and defense. The city is peopled primarily by the \"goodly\" races (humans, dwarves, gnomes, elves, halflings, and half-elves), but no being is turned away from Silverymoon because of its race—though a drow or an orc proving true to one's blood is sure to be punished in full for transgressing against the peace of the city. I will make no secret of my love for my home in the following summary, but I will endeavor to be as evenhanded as I can in describing it.": "长期以来，银月城是领主联盟的一个强大而有影响力的成员，而且，在其存在的整个过程中，银月城是许多城市所向往的：一个安静、和平的王国，许多种族为了共同的知识、庆祝和防御而生活在一起。这个城市的居民主要是 \"善良 \"的种族（人类、矮人、地精、精灵、半身人和半精灵），但没有人因为自己的种族而被银月城拒之门外--尽管证明自己血统的鸦人或兽人肯定会因为侵犯城市的和平而受到全面的惩罚。在下面的总结中，我将毫不掩饰我对我的家园的热爱，但我将努力在描述它时尽可能地公平。",
	"The Gem of the North is a stunning place of sweeping curves, soaring towers, and structures built into the living trees. To many elves, the city is a reminder of the ancient elven cities of old; some call it the Myth Drannor of the North, even nowadays after the restoration and subsequent fall of that fabled city. Even where stone is employed in construction, ivy and other living plants grow through, over, or around most structural elements, giving most of the city a green cast.": "北方的宝石是一个令人惊叹的地方，它有一望无际的曲线，高耸的塔楼，以及建在活树上的结构。对许多精灵来说，这座城市让人想起古老的精灵城市；有些人称它为北方的神话Drannor，即使是在那个传说中的城市恢复和随后衰落的今天。即使在建筑中使用了石头，常春藤和其他活的植物也会穿过、越过或围绕着大多数结构元素生长，使城市的大部分地方都呈现出绿色。",
	"Despite its arboreal architecture, Silverymoon is very much civilized, boasting schools of music and magic, a great library, bardic instruction, and temples or shrines to Mielikki, Oghma, Silvanus, Sune, Tymora, and Mystra. Knowledge, both the acquisition of it and the wisdom that comes from diligent study, is the real treasure of Silverymoon, as much as magic or wealth could ever be.": "尽管银月岛的建筑是树状的，但它是非常文明的，拥有音乐和魔法学校，一个伟大的图书馆，吟游诗人的指导，以及米利基、奥格玛、希尔瓦娜斯、苏妮、泰莫拉和神秘拉的寺庙或神龛。知识，包括知识的获取和勤奋学习带来的智慧，是银月城真正的财富，就像魔法或财富一样多。",
	"While it is easy and pleasing enough to get lost among the trees of the city, anyone who comes close enough to the River Raurin is awed by the vision of the Moonbridge: the great arch of silvery force that spans the water. Even for those native to the city, it is a powerful, moving sight, and some claim to see the goddess Lurue (for whom the city is named) dancing above the motes of the bridge when no one else is watching.": "虽然在城市的树木中迷路很容易，也很讨人喜欢，但任何靠近劳林河的人都会被月亮桥的景象所震撼：那座横跨水面的银色大拱门。即使对那些土生土长的人来说，这也是一个强大的、令人感动的景象，有些人声称在没有人注意到的时候，看到女神露露（该城市就是以她命名的）在桥的微尘上跳舞。",
	"Given its beauty, a visit to Silverymoon is among the most memorable experiences most non-Silvaeren might have. Even among those that regularly fight monsters or handle magic, Silverymoon is a place of quiet, contemplative beauty, splendid opportunities for learning, and respite from the harsher realities of the North.": "鉴于它的美丽，访问Silverymoon是大多数非Silvaeren可能拥有的最难忘的经历之一。即使在那些经常与怪物战斗或处理魔法的人中，银月岛也是一个具有安静、沉思之美的地方，是学习的绝好机会，也是对北方残酷现实的喘息。",
	"Folk seeking knowledge that has been lost or hidden often come to Silverymoon seeking a means to find it, whether by studying in the Vault of the Sages or perusing the Map House for the location of a lost city or grove. These are but two of the many buildings and houses of learning in the Conclave of Silverymoon, the great center of knowledge and wisdom that forms much of the city's southern part. If a map, a book, or a spell exists anywhere in Faerûn, knowledge of it likely exists here, even if only a mere mention in a tome or a recollection of one of the city's great sages. Candlekeep might be the greatest assembly of written knowledge anywhere in the world, but in the end, that place represents accumulation for its own sake. Silverymoon is where study and wisdom are honored. If your charge is to translate an ancient tome in a lost language, to learn the proper intonation of a complex song, or to better understand the cryptic writings of a long-dead sage, there is no better place to seek aid than Silverymoon.": "寻求失落或隐藏的知识的人们经常来到银月城，寻求找到它的方法，无论是在贤者之库中学习，还是在地图馆中寻找失落的城市或丛林的位置。这些只是银月会所中众多建筑和学习场所中的两处，银月会所是知识和智慧的伟大中心，构成了城市南部的大部分地区。如果一张地图、一本书或一个咒语存在于法鲁恩的任何地方，那么它的知识很可能存在于这里，即使只是在一本巨著中提到，或者是城市中的一位伟大的圣人的回忆。烛台可能是世界上最伟大的书面知识集结地，但最终，这个地方代表着为自己而积累的东西。银月城是学习和智慧受到尊重的地方。如果你的任务是翻译一本失传语言的古籍，学习一首复杂歌曲的正确音调，或者更好地理解一位早已去世的圣人的隐秘著作，没有比银月城更好的地方可以寻求帮助了。",
	"It is an easy thing to come to Silverymoon seeking knowledge of one subject, and find oneself so enraptured by the study that it takes a lifetime to accomplish—or to realize that it was the study, rather than the sought-after fact, that one truly desired. Although tutors and sages in every field can be found In Silverymoon, rarely is interaction with one so simple as to ask a question and be provided an answer. Learning to cast a particular spell, to find an ancient ruin, or understand a specific secret might involve undergoing months of instruction to prove to a teacher that the knowledge imparted is being entrusted to a deserving person.": "来银月岛寻求某一学科的知识是件很容易的事，但却发现自己被这一研究深深吸引，以至于用一生的时间来完成，或者意识到自己真正渴望的是研究，而不是所追求的事实。尽管在银月城可以找到各个领域的导师和圣人，但很少有与他们的互动是如此简单的，即问一个问题并得到一个答案。学习施展一个特定的法术，找到一个古老的遗迹，或者了解一个特定的秘密，可能需要经历几个月的指导，以向老师证明所传授的知识是委托给一个值得信赖的人。",
	"In the east of the city is the High Palace, capital of the city and of the fallen state of Luruar. Lord Methrammar Aerasumé lives in this high, slender-spired structure. The merlons of its battlements are carved to resemble unicorn heads. The soldiers of the High Guard, clad in shining silver plate, protect the residence and seat of power, and keep those out that don't have business within.": "在城市的东部是高级宫殿，它是城市和堕落的鲁鲁尔国的首都。梅特拉姆-艾拉苏梅勋爵住在这座高大、细长的建筑里。它的垛口的梅龙雕刻得很像独角兽的头。穿着闪亮的银色盔甲的高级卫队士兵，保护着这座住宅和权力的所在地，并将那些没有业务的人挡在外面。",
	"Silverymoon has long been led by a high mage. One of the longest ruling, and certainly the most influential of these, Alustriel Silverhand, stepped down more than a hundred years ago to become the High Lady of Luruar, and was succeeded by Taern Hornblade. Though he ruled wisely over the last century, Taern recently relinquished the city's leadership to High Marshal Methrammar Aerasumé, Alustriel's half-elf son and the leader of Silverymoon's armed forces. Taern still speaks for the city on Methrammar's behalf at meetings of the Lords' Alliance, as the new ruler is far too blunt and impatient to suit the other lords of the compact.": "银月城长期以来一直由一位高级法师领导。其中执政时间最长的，当然也是最有影响力的，Alustriel Silverhand，一百多年前卸任，成为鲁鲁尔的高级夫人，由Taern Hornblade接任。虽然他在过去的一个世纪里进行了明智的统治，但Taern最近将城市的领导权交给了高级元帅Methrammar Aerasumé，Alustriel的半精灵儿子和Silverymoon武装力量的领导者。泰恩仍然在领主联盟的会议上代表梅特拉姆为城市说话，因为这位新统治者太过直率和急躁，不适合契约的其他领主。",
	"Silverymoon is defended by several forces. First are the Knights in Silver, the shining-armored warriors that patrol the city and the nearby lands. Officers of the Knights are well trained in tactics and military history, and have high opinions of their own abilities and those of their comrades—opinions that are very often borne out. They are bolstered by the Spellguard, a cadre of powerful wizards and sorcerers that train in battle magic. Last is the city's own mythal, the great field of magical force that prevents the inhabitants of the city from engaging in all manner of spellcasting. In particular, spells that summon flame, conjure creatures, or permit teleportation fail when their target is within the bounds of the mythal. Should a foe try to traverse the Moonbridge, the span can be willed (by the city's rulers, and certain others specially attuned to the mythal) out of existence, dropping attackers into the river.": "银月城由几支部队保卫。首先是银色骑士团，他们是在城市和附近土地上巡逻的闪亮的盔甲战士。骑士团的军官们在战术和军事历史方面训练有素，对自己和战友的能力有很高的评价--这些评价往往被证实了。他们得到法术护卫队的支持，这是一支由强大的魔法师和巫师组成的队伍，他们在战斗中接受魔法训练。最后是这个城市自己的神话，巨大的魔法力量领域阻止了城市居民从事各种形式的法术表演。特别是，召唤火焰、召唤生物或允许传送的法术在其目标处于神域范围内时都会失败。如果有敌人试图穿越月桥，这个跨度可以被（由城市的统治者，以及其他一些特别适应神话的人）控制住，把攻击者丢进河里。",
	"No city's prestige was harmed more than Silverymoon's by the recent war and the subsequent dismantling of the Silver Marches. Though they tried to bolster the nearby cities, the Silvaeren were accused of providing insufficient and incompetent support to Sundabar, the surface population of which was entirely wiped out. In the end, all of the dwarven states stepped away from Luruar, and without the support of those kingdoms or the leadership that Alustriel provided at its founding, the confederacy collapsed. Taern Hornblade isn't as powerful a voice in the Lords' Alliance as Alustriel was, either, in part because his affection and respect for the former High Lady has been extended, in large part, to her sister Laeral, now the Open Lord of Waterdeep.": "没有哪个城市的威望比银月城的威望在最近的战争和随后银色地带的瓦解中受到的伤害更大。尽管Silvaeren试图支持附近的城市，但他们被指责为对Sundabar提供了不充分和无能的支持，其地表人口被完全消灭了。最后，所有的矮人国家都退出了鲁鲁修，没有这些王国的支持，也没有阿鲁斯特里尔在成立时提供的领导，联盟崩溃了。泰恩-霍恩布雷德在领主联盟中的话语权也不像阿鲁斯特里尔那样强大，部分原因是他对前大夫人的感情和尊重在很大程度上已经延伸到她的妹妹拉伊尔，现在是水底世界的公开领主。",
	"Despite reports of her death decades ago, rumors have recently reached the city that High Lady Alustriel is in fact alive and active in southern lands. Seemingly, she has contacted neither her son nor her former comrade, Taern Hornblade—though given how widely known Taern's hopeless love for the High Lady was, and the long years he took to overcome his grief, it's not certain how he would react upon receiving proof of her survival.": "尽管有报道说她几十年前就死了，但最近有传言说，Alustriel大夫人实际上还活着，并在南方的土地上活动。看起来，她既没有联系过她的儿子，也没有联系过她以前的战友泰恩-霍恩布拉德--尽管考虑到泰恩对大夫人无望的爱是多么广为人知，而且他花了很长时间来克服他的悲痛，不确定他在收到她生存的证据后会有什么反应。",
	"Silverymoon has nonetheless long been known as a safe haven for Harpers in the North, because the city doesn't see the aims of the Alliance as conflicting with Those Who Harp. Where other cities' rulers might see the presence of the Harpers as a threat to their authority, Silverymoon desires an end to tyranny as fervently as the Harpers do, and thus the greater good is served. At the same time, some Silvaeren believe that the city's tolerance of certain other members of the Alliance (some mention Mirabar, others Baldur's Gate) is somewhat naive.": "尽管如此，银月城长期以来一直被称为北方哈珀人的安全避难所，因为该城不认为联盟的目标与哈珀人有冲突。其他城市的统治者可能会把哈珀人的存在视为对他们权威的威胁，而银月城则像哈珀人一样热切地渴望结束暴政，因此更多的利益得到了满足。同时，一些Silvaeren认为，该城市对联盟中某些其他成员（有人提到米拉巴尔，有人提到博德之门）的宽容有些天真。",
	"Rising from the shores of its deep harbor to ring the great mountain standing tall out of the Sea of Swords is Waterdeep, the City of Splendors and the Crown of the North. To all of Faerûn, this great metropolis stands as the pinnacle of what a great city might be, in wealth, influence, and stability. Here, the citizens work, the nobles sneer, and the great masked lords plot and scheme, all while merchants dance between them to collect their coins and continue profiting as best they can. Waterdeep's shops and merchants offer goods of every sort from every corner of Toril, and even the rarest of items can be procured, given sufficient coin and patience. Adventurers lacking one or the other can very easily find all manner of employment, from simple escorting of caravans, to guarding nobility, to investigating a ruin or rumor of monsters anywhere in the North.": "沃特迪普（Waterdeep）从其深邃的港口岸边升起，环绕着剑海中高高耸立的大山，它是辉煌之城和北方的王冠。对于整个法鲁恩来说，这座伟大的都市在财富、影响力和稳定性方面都是一个伟大城市的顶峰。在这里，市民们在工作，贵族们在冷嘲热讽，伟大的蒙面领主们在密谋和策划，而商人们则在他们之间跳舞，收集他们的硬币，并继续尽其所能地获取利益。沃特德普的商店和商人提供来自托里尔每个角落的各种商品，只要有足够的硬币和耐心，甚至最稀有的物品也能买到。缺乏这两样东西的冒险者可以很容易地找到各种工作，从简单的护送商队，到守卫贵族，再到调查遗迹或北方任何地方的怪物传闻。",
	"Though it has stood for hundreds of years, Waterdeep is only now returning to its status of a century and a half ago. The recent disruptions began when the gods walked the Realms and slew each other before the eyes of mortals, until they walked back to their divine domains through the very streets of Waterdeep itself. Decades later, more deities began dying off, magic failed, and all manner of catastrophes started altering the very nature of the city. Lord Neverember wasted the city's navy and then, instead of rebuilding it, hired sailors out of Mintarn (and profited from the endeavor).": "虽然它已经屹立了几百年，但沃特德普现在才恢复到一个半世纪前的状态。最近的混乱开始于诸神行走在王国中，在凡人的眼前互相残杀，直到他们通过水底世界的街道走回他们的神域。几十年后，更多的神祗开始死去，魔法失效，各种灾难开始改变城市的本质。永恒之主浪费了城市的海军，然后，他没有重建它，而是从明坦恩雇佣了水手（并从中获利）。",
	"Now, the City of Splendors is on the mend. The harbor has been cleared of the broken ships that made up the former district of Mistshore, and Waterdeep again has its own navy. The city's Guard (its army), Watch (police force), Navy, and it famous Griffon Cavalry are all being reformed, but all of that might be a matter of years in the settling. A plague chased most residents out of the Warrens and Downshadow, and living or digging below the city's surface has been deemed illegal except by those authorized by the lords to do so. Somehow, even the air seems fresher. In the words of one wise moon elf matron (whose status as my aunt has positively no bearing on her wisdom), \"Waterdeep is back to where it was when I was a lass.\"": "现在，辉煌之城正在恢复中。港口已经清除了组成前Mistshore区的破船，沃特德普又有了自己的海军。城市的卫队（军队）、守望（警察部队）、海军和著名的狮鹫骑兵都在进行改革，但所有这些都可能是几年后的事。一场瘟疫将大多数居民赶出了沃伦和唐沙德，除了那些被领主授权的人，在城市表面以下生活或挖掘被视为非法。不知何故，连空气都显得更加清新。用一位睿智的月精灵族长的话说（她作为我姑姑的身份与她的智慧毫无关系），\"沃特德普又回到了我还是小姑娘时的样子。\"",
	"Perhaps most surprising of the newest developments is the return of Laeral Silverhand to Waterdeep. Long thought dead, she reemerged only recently, and swiftly rallied the masked lords to support her supplanting of Dagult Neverember as Open Lord of Waterdeep. Very few remember Lady Laeral from her previous time in the city, but those elves who have been living in there for the last century claim she is more reserved than she once was. The new Open Lord doesn't speak of her family—any mention of her children, her late husband (the fabled Blackstaff, Khelben Arunsun), or any of her famed sisters is cause for her to cut short whatever conversation may be in progress at the time. Her relationship with the current Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr, is cordial, but the two are seldom seen in one-on-one conversation, and most think that Lady Laeral has little to learn from a mage who isn't nearly her equal.": "在最新的发展中，也许最令人惊讶的是拉伊尔-银手（Laeral Silverhand）回到了水底世界。长期以来，人们一直认为她已经死了，直到最近她才重新出现，并迅速召集了蒙面领主支持她取代达古特-纽伦堡成为水底城的公开领主。很少有人记得莱拉尔女士以前在这个城市的时候，但那些在过去一个世纪里一直生活在那里的精灵们声称她比以前更保守了。这位新的开放领主不谈论她的家庭--只要提到她的孩子、她已故的丈夫（传说中的黑杖，Khelben Arunsun），或者她任何一位著名的姐妹，她就会打断当时可能正在进行的任何谈话。她与现任黑袍人瓦杰拉-萨法尔的关系很融洽，但两人很少在一对一的谈话中出现，大多数人认为拉伊尔夫人没有什么可以从一个几乎与她不相上下的法师那里学到。",
	"As always, the Open Lord is selected and supported by several masked lords, who bear masks, robes, and amulets to disguise themselves when publicly sitting in judgment or council, and who make policies for Waterdeep. Every Waterdhavian has suspicions as to whether this or that influential citizen is or isn't a lord of the city, and some are willing to make their beliefs public, but few who are confronted in such a way have ever claimed to be a lord, and none of those have also produced proof of that assertion.": "像往常一样，公开的领主是由几个戴面具的领主挑选和支持的，他们带着面具、长袍和护身符，在公开坐镇审判或议会时伪装自己，并为水底城制定政策。每个沃特德人都会怀疑这个或那个有影响力的公民是否是城市的领主，有些人愿意将他们的信念公之于众，但以这种方式面对的人，很少有人声称自己是领主，那些人也没有拿出证据来证明这种说法。",
	"Not hidden at all are the other lords of the city—the nobles of Waterdeep, whose high-nosed behavior and heavy-handed spending establish fashion in the city, which in turn creates trends all across the North for clothing, weaponry, favored trinkets, music, and any other preference that can be changed at a whim by those with enough coin to afford the expense. More than seventy-five noble families call Waterdeep home, representing between them all manner of business interests, rivalries, and internal strife.": "毫不掩饰的是城市的其他领主--沃特迪普的贵族们，他们的高调行为和大手笔的消费在城市中建立了时尚，这反过来又为整个北方的服装、武器、受宠的饰品、音乐以及其他任何可以被那些有足够的钱财来支付费用的人随意改变的偏好创造了潮流。超过75个贵族家庭以沃特德为家，他们之间代表着各种商业利益、竞争和内部纷争。",
	"Being a noble carries with it a great deal of advantage. Operating from one's place at the head of the economic and social hierarchy, a noble can easily lift a mediocre craftperson out of obscurity, dash the hopes of a wealthy merchant of ever securing another contract within the city, or provide the backing an ambitious adventuring band needs to find fame and great wealth. The only true competition nobles face is from one another. Such rivalries are the source of much gossip and intrigue as the nobles of Waterdeep always try to maintain at least a veneer of civility in their squabbles.": "作为一个贵族，有很大的优势。在经济和社会等级制度的领导下，贵族可以轻易地把一个平庸的手艺人从默默无闻中拉出来，使一个富有的商人在城市中获得另一份合同的希望破灭，或者为一个雄心勃勃的冒险团提供寻找名声和巨大财富所需的支持。贵族们面临的唯一真正的竞争是来自彼此。这种竞争是许多流言蜚语和阴谋的来源，因为沃特德普的贵族们总是试图在他们的争吵中至少保持一种文明的表面形象。",
	"Although they seldom agree on much, one matter that all the noble houses see the same way is that their status should not be tainted by newcomers, and certainly not by anyone so brightcoin as to purchase one's way to a noble title. When during Lord Neverember's tenure it became legal for impoverished houses to sell their titles, and thus allow others to become noble, many leaders of the old-blood houses were apoplectic, particularly after some purchasers lost all their coin and sold their titles again within a season or two. Open Lord Laeral Silverhand has, to the relief of those leaders, seen the folly of this decision, and gathered enough support among the Lords of Waterdeep to not only reverse it, but to restore titles and lands to noble families who lost them through folly. The change has won her much support among the nobles. Now Zhents and Thayans and Baldurian merchants have coin enough to buy property within the city, if they choose, but that is no reason to award them noble titles and legal rights, instead of merely a mansion, for doing so.": "虽然他们很少达成一致意见，但所有贵族家族都有一个共同点，那就是他们的地位不应受到新人的玷污，当然也不能被任何如此光明正大的人以购买方式获得贵族头衔。在Neverember勋爵的任期内，当贫穷的家族可以出售他们的头衔，从而允许其他人成为贵族时，许多旧血统家族的领导人感到震惊，特别是在一些购买者失去了他们所有的硬币并在一两个赛季内再次出售他们的头衔之后。令这些领导人欣慰的是，开放领主拉拉尔-银手（Laeral Silverhand）看到了这一决定的愚蠢之处，并在水底城的领主中聚集了足够的支持，不仅推翻了这一决定，还将头衔和土地恢复给那些因愚蠢而失去它们的贵族家庭。这一改变为她在贵族中赢得了很多支持。现在，Zhents和Thayans以及Baldurian商人有足够的硬币在城市内购买房产，如果他们选择的话，但这并不是授予他们贵族头衔和合法权利的理由，而不仅仅是一座豪宅。",
	"Waterdeep has long been divided into several large regions called wards. To locals these are essential to Waterdeep, but outsiders often lose track of which ward they're in or what a ward's name signifies. The names of the wards suggest the contents of the buildings and the character of the activity in each one, but no laws exist that restrict a given activity or class of people to any specific ward.": "长期以来，沃特德普一直被划分为几个大的区域，称为病房。对当地人来说，这些区域是沃特德的重要组成部分，但外来者往往不知道他们在哪个区，也不知道一个区的名字意味着什么。病区的名字暗示着每个病区的建筑内容和活动特点，但没有任何法律限制某个特定的活动或某类人在任何特定的病区。",
	"As the name indicates, Castle Ward contains Castle Waterdeep, Piergeiron's Palace, and many other public buildings of the city. This ward is home to mainly the wealthy or influential who can't count themselves among the nobility. Other structures are taken up by educational or religious concerns that primarily serve the city at large, not the residents of the ward.": "顾名思义，城堡区包含了沃特德普城堡、皮尔吉隆的宫殿，以及城市的许多其他公共建筑。这个区主要是那些不能算作贵族的富人或有影响力的人的家。其他建筑则由教育或宗教机构占据，主要服务于整个城市，而不是本区的居民。",
	"Most of the city's harbor area is located in Dock Ward, as are the businesses and warehouses that depend on the city's newly restored harbor. It's a crowded neighborhood of many winding streets, where folk are comfortable making deals that might in other places provoke the displeasure of the law.": "该市的大部分港口地区都位于码头区，依赖该市新修复的港口的企业和仓库也在这里。这是一个由许多蜿蜒的街道组成的拥挤街区，在这里，人们可以自如地进行交易，而在其他地方可能会引起法律的不满。",
	"Of relatively recent vintage, the Field Ward stands between the inner and outer north walls of the city (an area formerly used as a caravan grounds). This ward grew up in a messy, unregulated fashion and is home to many of the poorest residents of the city.": "相对来说，田野区是最近才出现的，它矗立在城市的内墙和外墙的北墙之间（这个地区以前被用作大篷车的场地）。这个区在混乱的、不受管制的情况下成长起来，是城市中许多最贫穷的居民的家。",
	"Home to many noble villas, townhouses, and a great many inns, North Ward is the neighborhood of the respectably wealthy.": "北区是许多贵族别墅、联排别墅和大量旅馆的所在地，是受人尊敬的富人的社区。",
	"Those whose fortunes are on the rise build their homes in Sea Ward, and they join many long-established noble families in residence. This area in the northwest of the city is home to much of the city's wealth, the location of the grandest villas of the city's noble families (except for those in North Ward).": "那些财富正在上升的人在海区建造他们的家园，他们与许多历史悠久的贵族家庭一起居住。这个位于城市西北部的地区是城市大部分财富的所在地，是城市贵族家庭最宏伟的别墅所在地（除了北区的别墅）。",
	"Stables, warehouses, and shops related to overland trade dominate Southern Ward. Most residents are hardworking folk that load and unload caravan carts, and otherwise perform low-paying work.": "马厩、仓库和与陆路贸易有关的商店在南区占主导地位。大多数居民都是勤劳的人，他们装载和卸载商队的马车，以及从事其他低报酬的工作。",
	"A narrow slice of land between the Castle Ward and the City of the Dead, Trades Ward is the center of commerce for the city, with most of the smaller transactions and respectable trade taking place here.": "贸易区是城堡区和死亡之城之间的一片狭长的土地，是城市的商业中心，大多数小型交易和值得尊敬的贸易都在这里进行。",
	"The city's walled cemetery, the City of the Dead is the only place in Waterdeep where it is legal to bury the deceased. It is used by many citizens as a public park during the day, a lovely green space of pretty mausoleums and grand statues in which to escape the city's hustle and bustle.": "亡灵之城是城市的围墙墓地，是沃特迪普唯一合法埋葬死者的地方。它在白天被许多市民用作公共公园，一个由漂亮的陵墓和宏伟的雕像组成的可爱的绿色空间，在这里可以逃避城市的喧嚣和骚动。",
	"While not considered by many to be a ward of the city, the little villages and many farms that sprawl across the land east of the city were lawfully incorporated into Waterdeep when it moved a barracks and training facility to the area.": "虽然很多人不认为它是城市的一个区，但当沃特德普将一个军营和训练设施搬到该地区时，遍布城市东部土地的小村庄和许多农场被合法地纳入了沃特德普。",
	"Situated in the fork where the Rivers Surbrin and Dessarin join near the Evermoor Way, Yartar is a fortified town that, were it not for its own petty, internal squabbles, might wield more influence among its fellows in the North. Currently, it is most remarkable for its barge-building operation (and that industry's importance to the commerce of other settlements) and its annual fairs.": "亚尔塔位于苏尔布林河和德萨林河的分叉处，靠近埃弗莫尔路，是一个设防的城镇，如果不是因为其内部的小争吵，它可能会在北方的伙伴中产生更大的影响。目前，它最引人注目的是它的驳船制造业务（以及该行业对其他定居点商业的重要性）和它的年度博览会。",
	"Each summer, except in years when Shieldmeet occurs, a vast Hiring Fair is held in Yartar, during which all sorts of undesirable folk gather north of the town looking for work as guards, miners, farmhands, guides, or other unskilled laborers. For the most part, those who attend this fair are brutes, bandits, freeholders whose lands can no longer sustain them, or Uthgardt who wish to be among \"civilized\" folk for a short time—but occasionally, a strong hand or a skilled warrior can be culled from the bunch. While this event is going on, Yartar is overrun with visitors it would rather not welcome, who steal goods, sell wares in the street (sometimes those they have just stolen), meet unscrupulous contacts to hand off coin, information, or purloined items, and engage in the occasional spell duel. It's quite common for a new adventuring company to come into being at one of these fairs, when those who stand out from the crowd because they have legitimate skills to sell gravitate toward one another and decide to form a group.": "每年夏天，除了在Shieldmeet发生的年份，亚尔塔都会举行一个大型的雇佣交易会，期间，各种不良的民俗都会聚集在镇子的北部，寻找警卫、矿工、农场工人、导游或其他非技术工人的工作。在大多数情况下，参加这个集市的人都是野蛮人、强盗、土地无法继续维持的自由人，或者希望在 \"文明 \"人中待上一段时间的乌斯加德人，但偶尔也能从这群人中挖出一个强壮的人或一个熟练的战士。当这种情况发生时，雅尔塔就会有很多它不欢迎的访客，他们偷东西，在街上卖东西（有时是他们刚偷来的东西），遇到不择手段的人交出钱币、信息或偷来的物品，并偶尔进行法术决斗。在这些集市上，当那些因为有合法技能可以出售而从人群中脱颖而出的人相互吸引并决定组成一个团体时，新的冒险公司就会出现，这很常见。",
	"In those years when Shieldmeet falls, the town is instead treated to a great festival on that day, sponsored mainly by the local temple to Tymora, the Happy Hall of Fortuitous Happenstance. The Shieldmeet festival features a number of games of chance, skill, and bravery, from dice and darts, to drunken running, to wrestling and other physical contests. Occasionally, the Tymoran priests use this festival to identify adventurers whom the goddess has called to a particular task, selected for a blessing, or otherwise marked for some undetermined destiny.": "在Shieldmeet落下的那些年里，小镇在这一天反而会迎来一个盛大的节日，主要是由当地的Tymora神庙--幸运的幸福殿堂赞助。Shieldmeet节的特点是有许多机会、技巧和勇敢的游戏，从骰子和飞镖，到醉酒跑步，到摔跤和其他身体竞赛。偶尔，泰莫拉的祭司们会利用这个节日来确认那些被女神召唤去完成特定任务的冒险者，被选中接受祝福的冒险者，或者以其他方式为某些未确定的命运做标记。",
	"Whether during the Hiring Fair or the Shieldmeet festival, each summer at least one adventuring band seems to get its start in Yartar. Most fall into obscurity, but the Smiling Company—the still-active portion of a larger band of warriors who gathered in Yartar nearly a decade ago—still enjoys moderate success, and makes annual contributions to the Happy Hall.": "无论是在招聘会还是在Shieldmeet节期间，每年夏天似乎都有至少一支冒险乐队在雅尔塔起步。大多数人都默默无闻，但 \"微笑团\"--近十年前聚集在雅尔塔的一支更大的勇士队伍中仍然活跃的部分--仍然享有适度的成功，并且每年为快乐大厅做出贡献。",
	"Yartar is ruled by a Waterbaron who is elected for life. The current Waterbaron is Nestra Ruthiol, a hot-tempered woman who is wickedly calculating; though she is free with her words and her insults, she seldom takes action against rivals unless she is sure such can be done to the most efficiently painful effect. During my last visit to Yartar, accusations arose against the Waterbaron that she had murdered a man, Kaidrod Palyr, who was later revealed to have been her lover. His body was found in the river, with the soaked remnant of what appeared to be Nestra Ruthiol's favorite cloak. That she loudly and publicly argued with Palyr's wife, Tiarshe, shortly before the accusations came to light did little to help her reputation, or the impression of her innocence. When she was finally cleared of the charges, Waterbaron Ruthiol made it clear that she didn't wish to speak of the matter again, and she would ensure that anyone who brought it up in official dealings would be quite unhappy with the results. Though there are whispers, it has not been mentioned in her presence since. Some blame the murder on the Hand of Yartar, the local thieves' guild, but I believe that Kaidrod was killed, and the Waterbaron was implicated, in order to free up the post for one of her rivals within the city.": "雅尔塔的统治者是一位终身当选的水霸。现任水龙是内斯特拉-鲁西奥（Nestra Ruthiol），一个脾气暴躁、诡计多端的女人；虽然她说话和侮辱都很随意，但她很少对对手采取行动，除非她确信这样做可以达到最有效的痛苦效果。在我上次访问雅尔塔期间，有人指责水巴伦谋杀了一个男人，凯德-帕里尔，后来发现他是她的情人。他的尸体在河里被发现，还有被浸湿的似乎是内斯特拉-鲁特希尔最喜欢的斗篷的残余物。在指控曝光前不久，她与帕里尔的妻子蒂亚什大声公开争吵，这对她的声誉或她的清白印象没有什么帮助。当她最终被洗清罪名时，水巴伦-鲁特希尔明确表示，她不想再提这件事，而且她会确保任何在官方交易中提起此事的人都会对结果感到相当不满。虽然有窃窃私语，但此后在她面前再也没有人提及此事。有些人把谋杀归咎于当地的盗贼行会Yartar之手，但我相信凯德洛德被杀，而水霸被牵连进来，是为了给她在城内的一个对手腾出职位。",
	"It is conflicts and schemes such as this that keep Yartar from gaining prominence in the North. If the town can overcome its internal problems, take advantage of what its fellows in the Lords' Alliance can offer, and find a way to reap greater profit from its position along major trade routes—where it stands as the gateway to all the settlements of the northeast—Yartar might soon grow in size, wealth, and influence. Physical growth would require clearing terrain for further settlement and building another encircling wall to protect settlers—and additional guards hired to protect those who do the work.": "正是这样的冲突和计划使雅尔塔无法在北方获得显赫地位。如果该镇能够克服内部问题，利用领主联盟的伙伴们所能提供的优势，并找到一种方法，从其主要贸易路线的位置上获得更大的利润--它是通往东北所有定居点的门户--雅尔塔可能很快就会在规模、财富和影响力上有所增长。实际的增长需要为进一步的定居开辟地形，并建立另一个包围墙来保护定居者--以及雇用更多的卫兵来保护那些工作的人。",
	"With its location near two great rivers and its proximity to a third (the Laughingflow, forming a trio the locals creatively call the Three Rivers), Yartar is a fishing town, and its tables have fish as fare at every meal. Fresh crabs, eels, and other river life are available both to eat and to purchase, and serve as a primary means of income for the fisherfolk of the town.": "雅尔塔是一个渔业镇，它的位置靠近两条大河，并且靠近第三条大河（笑流河，形成一个三人组，当地人创造性地称之为三河），每餐都有鱼作为食物。新鲜的螃蟹、鳗鱼和其他河流生物既可以吃也可以买，是该镇渔民的主要收入来源。",
	"The other major industry of Yartar is barge building. Most of the region's river barges are built, or at least begin their service, in Yartar, and the works of the town's bargewrights are famous all up and down the Dessarin and its tributaries. It is the importance of Yartar's barges to the commerce of the North that earned the town a place in the Lords' Alliance, to ensure that Yartar doesn't fall to enemies and cause upheaval in the trade network along the rivers.": "雅尔塔的另一个主要产业是驳船制造。该地区的大部分河道驳船都是在雅尔塔建造的，或者至少是在雅尔塔开始使用的，该镇的驳船工匠的作品在德萨林河及其支流上都很有名。正是由于雅尔塔的驳船对北方商业的重要性，使该镇在领主联盟中获得了一席之地，以确保雅尔塔不会落入敌人手中，造成沿河贸易网络的动荡。",
	"What can't be transported to or from Yartar by barge comes and goes by caravan instead, and the town's location makes it a key stop for most caravans passing between Waterdeep and Silverymoon. In Yartar, a caravan can arrange for swift repairs, replacements of wagon wheels, carts, or full wagons, or the replenishment of tack and other accessories.": "不能用驳船运进或运出亚尔塔的东西就用商队来代替，这个镇子的位置使它成为大多数商队在水底城和银月城之间的关键一站。在雅尔塔，商队可以安排快速维修，更换马车车轮、马车或整个马车，或补充马具和其他配件。",
	"Because Yartar has so few industries, and fewer close neighbors, its merchants are often in direct competition with one another, and have neither the resources to seek new customers, nor the space or funds to explore new trades. As a result, a good deal of the gossip, thievery, and assault in Yartar has at its roots one merchant trying to get the upper hand on a rival, either through damage of goods, intimidation of workers, or theft of patrons and customers.": "由于雅尔塔的产业太少，近邻也少，所以它的商人们经常彼此直接竞争，既没有资源去寻找新客户，也没有空间或资金去探索新的行业。因此，雅尔塔的很多流言蜚语、小偷小摸和袭击事件的根源是一个商人试图在对手面前占上风，要么通过损坏货物、恐吓工人，要么偷窃顾客和客户。",
	"To curb and control rowdiness, the Waterbaron employs the Shields of Yartar, a mounted force of guards who police the town, keep order, and chase off the Uthgardt raids that occasionally menace the lands nearby. The Shields are housed in the Shield Tower, a fortified structure on the west bank of the Surbrin (the town sits primarily on the east), whose outer wall has frequently been torn down and rebuilt. It's rumored that guardian skeletons rise when unauthorized folk tread the ground between the walls, but no one has tested the area to see if its magic still functions; even if it doesn't, more than a hundred angry warriors charging out of the tower at trespassers is enough danger to scare people out of pursuing the idea. A fortified bridge connects the banks between the tower and the town proper.": "为了抑制和控制喧嚣，水巴伦雇佣了雅尔塔的盾牌，这是一支骑兵部队，负责镇上的治安，维持秩序，并驱赶偶尔威胁附近土地的乌斯加德人的袭击。盾牌被安置在盾牌塔中，这是一个位于苏尔布林河西岸的防御性建筑（该镇主要位于东部），其外墙经常被拆毁和重建。有传言说，当未经授权的人踏上城墙之间的土地时，守护者的骷髅就会升起，但没有人测试过该地区的魔法是否仍在发挥作用；即使没有，一百多个愤怒的战士从塔中冲出，向闯入者冲去，也足以将人们吓得不敢再追问。一座坚固的桥连接着塔和城镇之间的河岸。",
	"More impressive than either the Shields or the Shield Tower is the Waterbaron's Barge. This massive vessel can carry two hundred soldiers or seventy-five Shields of Yartar with their horses. Its sides above the waterline are armored with iron. Behind its walls stand multiple crossbow contraptions, each able to fire a dozen bolts at once. When brought to bear against a force on the riverbank, the Shields loose two volleys against their enemies, then bring the Barge ashore and charge. No raiders have stood firm against such an assault.": "比盾牌或盾牌塔更令人印象深刻的是水霸的驳船。这艘巨大的船只可以装载两百名士兵或七十五名雅尔塔的盾牌和他们的马匹。它在水线以上的两侧都装上了铁甲。船壁后面有多个弩炮装置，每个都能同时发射一打弩箭。当与河岸上的部队对峙时，盾牌兵会对他们的敌人进行两轮射击，然后把驳船带上岸，进行冲锋。没有一个突击队员能在这样的攻击下站稳脚跟。",
	"In the center of town is the Waterbaron' Hall, a grand structure that is both the ruler's home and the location where she hears audiences. Feasts are often held here, though more often, the hall sees activity in its side rooms, where merchants dealing in large quantities of goods, or making deals and proposals that affect the entire community, can meet in comfort.": "在城镇的中心是水巴伦的大厅，这是一个宏伟的建筑，既是统治者的家，也是她听取意见的地方。宴会经常在这里举行，但更多时候，大厅的活动是在它的侧室进行的，在那里，交易大量货物的商人，或进行影响整个社区的交易和建议的商人，可以舒适地会面。",
	"Many folk consider the start of civilization in the North to be marked by the founding of Waterdeep. More learned folk are aware of the deeper history of the region, and know of at least some of the kingdoms that have been built by the residents of the North down the centuries.": "许多人认为北方文明的开始是以沃特德普的建立为标志。更有学识的人知道这个地区更深层次的历史，至少知道几个世纪以来北方居民建立的一些王国。",
	"Ruins of these kingdoms are scattered throughout the North, and many present-day cities and towns are built atop their remains, sometimes with their residents ignorant of what lies just beneath their boots.": "这些王国的废墟散布在整个北方，许多现今的城市和城镇都建在它们的遗迹之上，有时居民对他们靴子下的东西一无所知。",
	"The elven kingdom of Eaerlann, a survivor of the ancient Crown Wars, stretched from the High Forest to the Delimbiyr Vale. Weakened by the retreat of much of its populace to Evermeet and by orc attacks, Eaerlann finally fell six hundred years ago to the demons that burst forth from Ascalhorn (once known as Hellgate Keep and now as Hellgate Dell).": "Eaerlann的精灵王国是古代王室战争的幸存者，从高级森林延伸到Delimbiyr谷地。Eaerlann因大部分人口撤退到Evermeet以及兽人的攻击而被削弱，最终在六百年前被从Ascalhorn（曾被称为地狱之门堡垒，现在是地狱之门戴尔）迸发出来的恶魔们攻陷。",
	"Ten thousand years ago, the capital city of Illefarn occupied the site where Waterdeep stands today. A kingdom of elves that accepted both humans and dwarves in its lands, Illefarn stood intact for seven millennia. It was eventually fragmented by increasing human settlement of the area, and repeated orc attacks spelled its doom.": "一万年前，伊勒法恩的首都占据了今天水底世界的位置。作为一个同时接受人类和矮人的精灵王国，伊勒法恩完整地存在了七千年之久。它最终被越来越多的人类定居在该地区而支离破碎，而兽人的反复攻击则意味着它的末日。",
	"The short-lived human kingdom of Athalantar lay south of the High Forest in territory claimed by its self-styled Stag King thirteen centuries ago. Its rulers were briefly supplanted by magelords, but then reclaimed the throne, only to be wiped out by orcs within a few generations.": "昙花一现的人类王国Athalantar位于高级森林的南部，其领土在13个世纪前由其自封的雄鹿国王声称。它的统治者曾短暂地被魔法师取代，但后来又夺回了王位，只是在几代人的时间里被兽人消灭了。",
	"Dwarf, elf, and human monarchs all shared the rule of Phalorm, also known as the Realm of Three Crowns, which was founded nearly a thousand years ago in the High Moor. Phalorm lasted barely a century before repeated orc and goblin attacks overcame it.": "矮人、精灵和人类的君主都共同统治着Phalorm，也被称为三冠之境，它于近千年前在高沼泽地建立。在兽人和地精的反复攻击下，法洛姆只持续了一个世纪就被攻破了。",
	"When Phalorm fell, the surviving humans of the kingdom established the Kingdom of Man, formally known as Delimbiyran, which lasted only two generations. Its dissolution left behind a number of petty \"kingdoms\" that welcomed new human settlers in several locations, leading to the founding of new cities and towns on the Sword Coast and in its environs.": "当Phalorm陷落时，该王国幸存的人类建立了人的王国，正式称为Delimbiyran，它只持续了两代。它的解体留下了一些小的 \"王国\"，它们在一些地方欢迎新的人类定居者，导致在剑海岸及其周边地区建立了新的城市和城镇。",
	"For centuries, the legend of Netheril served as a lesson of human hubris and a lure for treasure hunters too prideful to learn from its story. Long before the Dales Compact and the advent of Dalereckoning, Netheril arose as a human empire founded on the might of magic learned from the golden Nether Scrolls, artifacts at least as old as the creator races. Flying Netherese cities drifted through the skies all over the North, but primarily they hung high over a verdant land that is now the desert of Anauroch.": "几个世纪以来，Netheril的传说一直是人类傲慢的教训，也是对太过骄傲而无法从其故事中学习的寻宝者的诱惑。早在Dales契约和Dalereckoning出现之前，Netheril就作为一个人类帝国出现了，它建立在从金色的Nether Scrolls学到的强大魔法上，这些神器至少和创造者的种族一样古老。飞行的尼瑟尔城市在北方各地的天空中飘荡，但主要是它们高悬在一片青翠的土地上，也就是现在的阿瑙罗赫沙漠。",
	"Then Karsus, one of the mighty mages of Netheril, dared to believe that he could wrest control of the Weave and become a god himself.

From the moments after the crash when the spilt blood was still fresh to the present day's moss-covered or dune-buried stones, the ruins of Netheril and its arcane secrets have drawn many to their doom.": "然后，尼瑟尔强大的法师之一卡萨斯，敢于相信他能夺取对 \"编织 \"的控制权并自己成为一个神。他几乎成功了，但在他的失败中，卡萨斯杀死了魔法女神，撕碎了织网，并将那些无法逃到其他星球的漂浮飞地送入地面坠落。从坠毁后血迹未干的那一刻起，到今天被苔藓覆盖或被沙丘掩埋的石头，尼瑟尔的废墟和它的奥秘吸引了许多人走向灭亡。",
	"Who am I? Son, I've got hairs on my back longer than that little beard o' yours. I fought with emerus to retake Felbarr, and marched with every dwarf king of the north to win back Gauntlgrym. Lost half my foot to an orc's blade, and slew every damned one that got in my way marching home. If I want to sit and enjoy my old age now that we finally drove the orcs back, I'll do just that, and courtesy be damned. I've earned my rest.

	"The history of the dwarves in the North is a long and violent one, dating back more than six millennia. Before there was a Standing Stone in the Dalelands, or a Waterdeep, or a Myth Drannor, there was the brief (in dwarven terms) glory of Besilmer, and the realms of Haunghdannar and Gharraghaur. Ruins now, to be sure, but these kingdoms lasted longer than almost any living realm of humans, even if their works have been forgotten by humans and dwarves alike.": "矮人在北方的历史是一段漫长而激烈的历史，可以追溯到六千多年前。在达利兰的立石、水底世界或神话德兰诺出现之前，曾有过贝西尔默的短暂（以矮人的说法）辉煌，以及豪格丹纳和加拉格豪尔的王国。可以肯定的是，现在是一片废墟，但这些王国几乎比任何活着的人类王国都要长久，即使他们的作品已经被人类和矮人遗忘。",
	"The greatest and most recent of these dwarven realms was Delzoun, also called the Northkingdom. It stretched from the western edge of what was then the Narrow Sea (later, the Great Desert of Anauroch) west almost to present-day Silverymoon, and from the Ice Mountains to the Nether Mountains. Citadels Adbar and Felbarr were fortresses of Delzoun, and Mirabar, Mithral Hall, and Sundabar all owe their existence to that ancient kingdom or its descendants. Fabled Gauntlgrym, said to be touched by the presence of Moradin himself, was built by Delzoun's dwarves—first as a mine, and then as a city. It was the dwarves of Delzoun who built Ironmaster, too, and all the great mines and renowned forges of the North reside in the halls of the dwarves.": "这些矮人王国中最伟大和最新的是德尔祖恩，也被称为北境王国。它从当时的狭海（后来的阿瑙罗赫大沙漠）的西部边缘向西延伸到今天的银月，从冰山到尼瑟山。Adbar和Felbarr城是德尔祖恩的要塞，Mirabar、Mithral Hall和Sundabar的存在都归功于那个古老的王国或其后代。传说中的Gauntlgrym，据说被Moradin本人的存在所触动，是由德尔祖恩的矮人建造的--首先是一个矿场，然后是一座城市。也是德尔祖恩的矮人建造了铁匠，北方所有伟大的矿场和著名的锻造厂都在矮人的大厅里。",
	"Now, when shield dwarves invoke the name of Delzoun, they are calling upon the glory of all their past accomplishments: every feat of architectural mastery, every fine blade or crushing warhammer forged, every kingdom and battle—won or lost—in defense of their people and the folk around them. The name is as much a battle cry and a badge of honor as it is a call into history, for although every dwarven settlement now has its own masters, kings, and queens, they all respect the memory of the great hammer of Delzoun and the glorious kingdom it represented.": "现在，当盾牌矮人呼唤德尔祖恩的名字时，他们是在呼唤他们过去所有成就的荣耀：每一个建筑大师的壮举，每一把精美的刀剑或铸造的粉碎性战锤，每一个王国和战斗的胜利或失败，以保卫他们的人民和他们周围的人民。这个名字既是战斗的呐喊，也是荣誉的徽章，因为尽管现在每个矮人定居点都有自己的主人、国王和女王，但他们都尊重德尔祖恩的大锤子和它所代表的光荣王国的记忆。",
	"The details in this section are drawn from the extensive teachings of Drorn Waranvil, a longbeard (dwarf elder) who is a retired veteran of the Iron Guard of Citadel Adbar and the Citadel Guards of Felbarr. Drorn fought in the orc wars of both this and the last century, and helped free Citadel Felbarr (twice) and Gauntlgrym before he put down his warhammer a few years ago and began to chronicle his experiences for the benefit of younger dwarves seeking to know more about their heritage and about the world of today from the proper perspective.": "本节中的细节来自于德洛恩-瓦兰维尔的大量教诲，他是一位长胡子（矮人长老），是阿德巴城铁卫和费尔巴尔城卫队的退役老兵。德洛恩参加了本世纪和上个世纪的兽人战争，并帮助解放了费尔巴尔城堡（两次）和冈特格雷姆，几年前他放下了他的战锤，开始记录他的经历，以帮助年轻的矮人从正确的角度了解他们的遗产和当今的世界。",
	"The North is littered with the remnants of many dwarven realms. Although much of the wealth at these sites has been plundered by monsters and adventurers over the centuries, evidence of the settlements and their borders remains graven on cavern walls, trail markings, and scattered coins. Some of these realms, and the marks that bear testimony to their presence, are detailed below.": "北方到处都是许多矮人王国的遗迹。虽然这些地方的大部分财富在几个世纪以来被怪物和冒险者掠夺，但这些定居点及其边界的证据仍然刻在洞壁、足迹标记和散落的硬币上。下面将详细介绍其中的一些领域，以及证明其存在的标记。",
	"The oldest evidence of dwarven settlement in the North comes from the former site of Haunghdannar. This small coastal realm arose nearly sixty-five centuries ago in the northern Sword Mountains and along the Sword Coast, then fell quickly and mysteriously some fifteen hundred years later. Some records suggest that many of the citizens, driven mad by the sea, sailed westward and never returned. Mark: A mountain, with a left-facing fish, surmounted by a seven-pointed star.": "矮人在北方定居的最古老的证据来自Haunghdannar的旧址。这个沿海小国在近65个世纪前出现在北部的剑山和剑海岸，然后在大约1500年后迅速而神秘地衰落。一些记录表明，许多公民被大海逼疯了，向西航行，再也没有回来。标记：一座山，有一条朝左的鱼，上面有一颗七角星。",
	"The dwarves of Gharraghaur were the original delvers beneath the earth at the site of present-day Mirabar. The kingdom was founded soon after Haunghdannar but didn't last as long; twelve hundred years later it succumbed to a horde of ravaging orcs. Mark: Four vertical, diamond-shaped gems, three set in a triangle, with the largest in the center.": "加拉格豪尔的矮人是今天米拉巴尔遗址地底的最初探索者。这个王国在豪格丹纳之后不久建立，但并没有持续那么久；一千两百年后，它屈服于肆虐的兽人部落。标志：四颗垂直的菱形宝石，三颗镶嵌在一个三角形中，最大的一颗在中间。",
	"Nearly six thousand years ago, shield dwarves established an aboveground realm in the Dessarin valley that they named Besilmer. They were the builders of two noted landmarks on the Sword Coast: the Stone Bridge and the Halls of the Hunting Axe. Less than three hundred years after it came into being, Besilmer was overrun and destroyed by a horde of humanoids and giants. Mark: a wheel over a plow.": "近六千年前，盾牌矮人在德萨林山谷建立了一个地面王国，他们将其命名为贝西尔默。他们是剑海岸上两个著名地标的建造者：石桥和猎斧大厅。在它出现后不到三百年，贝西尔默就被人形生物和巨人的部落占领并摧毁。标记：犁上的轮子。",
	"The great Northkingdom of the dwarves, Delzoun was carved out of the rock beneath the area known until recently as the Silver Marches. Founded soon after the fall of Besilmer, Delzoun remained a great power for nearly four thousand years, until orc hordes and subterranean monsters did it in. Many of Delzoun's greatest works, citadels such as Sundbarr and Adbar, survive and thrive yet today. Mark: a horizontal, double-headed hammer in a triangle of three sparkling gems. {@b The Dirge of Delzoun}": "作为矮人的伟大的北方王国，德尔祖恩是在最近被称为银色牧场的地区下面的岩石上雕刻出来的。在贝西尔默灭亡后不久建立的德尔祖恩，在近四千年的时间里一直是一个伟大的国家，直到兽人群和地下怪物将其消灭。许多德尔祖恩最伟大的作品，如Sundbarr和Adbar等城池，至今仍在生存和发展。标识：一个横向的双头锤子，在一个由三颗闪亮的宝石组成的三角形中。{@b The Dirge of Delzoun}",
	"The tale of the great Northkingdom of the shield dwarves, the Dirge of Delzoun takes more than a day to sing in its entirety. The song recounts the history of Delzoun, from its founding millennia ago to the dispersal of its cities and the settlement of the successor realms of dwarves in the North. It is performed only in Dwarvish, and no known written copies have ever been reported. Only a privileged few non-dwarves have ever heard the Dirge in its entirety, and dwarf bards who want to perform this epic must demonstrate great skill in both singing and history.": "盾牌矮人的伟大北方王国的故事，《德尔祖恩的哀歌》需要一天以上的时间来完整地演唱。这首歌讲述了德尔祖恩的历史，从几千年前的建国到城市的分散以及北方矮人后继王国的定居。它只用矮人语表演，而且没有已知的书面副本被报道过。只有少数非矮人有幸听过《哀歌》的全部内容，而想要表演这部史诗的矮人吟游诗人必须在歌唱和历史方面表现出高超的技巧。",
	"The current dirgekeeper is Ollyn Grimtongue of Citadel Felbarr, who was appointed by King Emerus Warcrown a century ago, and is the only dwarf permitted to add new lines to the ballad. It is believed that, now that Emerus has gone to the Halls of Moradin, Grimtongue is preparing a stanza honoring his former liege as a hero who rivals the champions of Old Delzoun.": "目前的守灵人是费尔巴城的奥林-格里姆通，他在一个世纪前被埃默斯-沃克伦国王任命，是唯一被允许在民谣中加入新句子的矮人。人们相信，现在埃默鲁斯已经去了莫拉丁大厅，Grimtongue正在准备一首诗，以纪念他的前领主，因为他是一个可以与旧戴尔松的冠军相媲美的英雄。",
	"In the extreme north of Faerûn, near the Cold Wood, lie the Ice Mountains. There, in the bitter cold, stands the eternal fortress of Citadel Adbar, the last great remnant of the Northkingdom, and glory of fallen Delzoun. For nearly eighteen centuries, Adbar has stood strong against every threat from every foe, and stood fast, to the great pride of its residents and our people throughout the region.": "在法鲁恩的最北端，靠近寒冰森林的地方，是冰山。在那里，在严寒中，矗立着永恒的堡垒--阿德巴城堡，这是北境的最后一个伟大的遗迹，也是堕落的德尔祖恩的荣耀。近十八个世纪以来，阿德巴一直坚强地抵御着来自每一个敌人的威胁，并坚守着，令其居民和整个地区的人民感到非常自豪。",
	"From the surface, Citadel Adbar looks less like a castle or a human city than a mountain carved to suit the purposes of the dwarves who live there. The two great towers that stand uppermost are ringed with vicious dragonspikes to keep large creatures from landing to attack the structures directly. The great chimney of the city's central foundry stands between them, belching smoke like a volcano about to erupt. Ringing the citadel is a host of platforms, battlements, and arrow slits from where defenders can fire crossbows at anyone foolish enough to attack the city.": "从表面上看，阿德巴城堡不像是一座城堡或人类城市，而像是一座为满足居住在那里的矮人的目的而雕刻的山。矗立在最上面的两座大塔被凶恶的龙刺环抱着，以防止大型生物登陆后直接攻击这些建筑。城市中央铸造厂的大烟囱矗立在它们之间，喷出的烟雾就像一座即将喷发的火山。环绕着城堡的是大量的平台、垛口和箭缝，防御者可以从那里向任何愚蠢到攻击城市的人发射弩箭。",
	"For centuries, Adbar has stood as the living monument of the Northkingdom. Already the main fortress of Delzoun when that empire fell, it only grew in importance to the dwarves of the region as other settlements were overrun by orcs, assailed by goblins, or simply disappeared. An orc horde hoping to take Citadel Adbar might rage against its walls, but to little effect, until the great, unyielding granite became the anvil against which they were smashed. The great drawbridge allowed none to pass except welcomed guests, and such guests were few indeed. Standing unconquered, it was the bastion of dwarven hope, glory, and trade.": "几个世纪以来，阿德巴一直是北方王国的活招牌。当德尔祖恩帝国灭亡时，它已经是德尔祖恩的主要堡垒，随着其他定居点被兽人占领、被地精袭击，或者干脆消失，它对该地区的矮人的重要性才逐渐增加。希望攻占阿德巴城堡的兽人部落可能会对它的城墙大发雷霆，但收效甚微，直到巨大的、不屈不挠的花岗岩成为他们被砸碎的砧板。巨大的吊桥允许任何人通过，除了受欢迎的客人，而这样的客人确实很少。它屹立不倒，是矮人希望、荣耀和贸易的堡垒。",
	"But now, for the first time in memory, my fellow Adbarran seem truly frightened at the prospect of opening the citadel to any outsiders. Perhaps they are reacting to the recent losses of the war, or the lack of leadership shown by our new king, or mere war-weariness, but for whatever reason Adbar's gates are even harder to move with soft words than they have been in the past, and there are fewer traders coming out of the city nowadays.": "但现在，在记忆中第一次，我的阿德巴兰同胞们似乎真的对向任何外人开放城堡的前景感到害怕。也许他们是对最近的战争损失的反应，或者是我们的新国王表现出的缺乏领导力，或者仅仅是对战争的厌倦，但不管是什么原因，阿德巴的大门比过去更难用柔和的语言来移动，而且现在从城里出来的商人也越来越少。",
	"The recent orc wars have cost the kingdom dearly, both in warriors and in leadership. In a short time, our long-ruling king, Harbromm, died. His unprepared twin sons shared the rule until the elder, Bromm, was himself killed by a dragon, leaving young King Harnoth with the rule of the ancient citadel.": "最近的兽人战争让王国损失惨重，无论是战士还是领导层。在很短的时间内，我们长期执政的国王哈布罗姆就死了。他毫无准备的双胞胎儿子分享了统治权，直到大儿子布罗姆自己被龙杀死，留下年轻的国王哈诺特统治这座古老的城堡。",
	"What followed was a great bleeding of the realm. Much was required to break the North out of the great siege the Many-Arrows orcs held it under. There are also whispers that King Harnoth led his Knights of the Mithral Shield out into the field to vent his rage and grief on the orcs in ill-advised assaults, winnowing down the once great Knights to fewer than two dozen. The Iron Guard, Adbar's army, appears as strong as ever it did, but given the extent of the losses against the orcs, it would be little surprise if their newer recruits were more smiths than warriors, serving their realm out of a sense of duty rather than a desire for battle. I served in the Guard for a century, but I've yet to test the newcomers to see just what they're made of.": "接下来是王国的一次大出血。要想让北境摆脱多箭兽人的巨大围困，需要很多东西。也有传言说，哈诺斯国王率领他的米特拉之盾骑士出征，在不明智的攻击中向兽人发泄他的愤怒和悲痛，将曾经伟大的骑士们削弱到不足二十人。铁卫军，阿德巴的军队，看起来和以前一样强大，但考虑到对兽人的损失程度，如果他们的新兵更多的是铁匠而不是战士，出于责任感而不是对战斗的渴望为他们的王国服务，那就没什么好奇怪的了。我在近卫军中服役了一个世纪，但我还没有测试过新人，看看他们到底是什么做的。",
	"If you are fortunate enough to be granted entry to Adbar, be wary of walking around on your own. Within the citadel are traps, deadfalls, and other hazards in various places waiting for someone to approach a protected location incorrectly. A guide, if you can find one, is necessary for newcomers to get around safely.": "如果你有幸获准进入阿德巴，要警惕自己四处走动。在堡垒内的各个地方都有陷阱、死亡陷阱和其他危险，等待着有人错误地接近受保护的地点。如果你能找到一个向导，对于新来的人来说，要想安全地走动，就必须有一个向导。",
	"Beneath the citadel proper, miles of dwarf-sized caverns form a confusing maze that frustrates most non-dwarf visitors. These tunnels are what remain of the early mining efforts inside the mountain. Below them lie the great ore mines of today, constantly being worked by crews of engineers and laborers.": "在城堡的正下方，数英里长的矮人大小的洞穴形成了一个混乱的迷宫，让大多数非矮人游客感到沮丧。这些隧道是山中早期采矿工作的遗迹。在它们下面是今天的大矿场，不断有工程师和工人在那里工作。",
	"By law, the mines are forbidden to visitors—even non-Adbarran dwarves—except in times of great emergency. So, given the impregnable nature of the fortress, no one not of Adbar has yet been privileged enough to witness what occurs down below. The citadel's Great Wheel, a most impressive sight even to a dwarf, is an ever-turning water wheel that provides power to keep Adbar's foundries, mines, and other operations working at all times. Near the wheel is the Hall of Moradin's Forge, a place of worship that reminds every dwarf of the Soul Forger's strength and enduring protection. One can't help but feel safe in its presence, and a true dwarf is home in the warmth of Moradin's shadow.": "根据法律规定，矿场禁止访客--甚至是非阿德巴兰矮人--除非在非常紧急的时候。因此，鉴于要塞坚不可摧的性质，非阿德巴的人还没有特权目睹下面发生的事情。城堡的大转轮，即使对矮人来说也是一个最令人印象深刻的景象，它是一个不断转动的水轮，为阿德巴的铸造厂、矿场和其他作业提供动力，使其随时都能运转。轮子附近是莫拉丁的锻造大厅，这是一个崇拜的地方，提醒每个矮人灵魂锻造师的力量和持久的保护。在它面前，人们不禁感到安全，一个真正的矮人在莫拉丁的温暖阴影下就是家。",
	"Given the current state of the surface lands around the citadel, it is no surprise that Adbarran are even more suspicious than usual of caravans and visitors that approach the city by means of an underground route. One such road arrives from the west, connecting Adbar to Mithral Hall and Mirabar through the ancient tunnels of Old Delzoun. Another tunnel leads south from Adbar to meet the Lowroad, which connects the ruins of Ascore in the east to Citadel Felbarr in the west.": "鉴于城堡周围地表土地的现状，阿德巴兰对通过地下通道进入城市的商队和游客比平时更加怀疑，这并不奇怪。有一条这样的道路从西边抵达，通过老德尔祖恩的古老隧道将阿德巴与米特拉尔厅和米拉巴尔连接起来。另一条隧道从阿德巴向南通向低路，低路连接着东部的阿斯科雷废墟和西部的费尔巴尔城堡。",
	"No matter where they come from, all roads leading to Adbar converge so that all travelers must confront the great pair of iron doors known as the Caravan Door. Like the rest of Citadel Adbar, this gate has never been breached. Mention the idea of that happening to an Adbarran dwarf, if you're looking to get a laugh.": "无论他们来自哪里，所有通往阿德巴的道路都会汇聚在一起，所以所有的旅行者都必须面对被称为商队之门的那对巨大的铁门。和阿德巴城的其他地方一样，这扇门从未被攻破过。如果你想找点乐子的话，可以向阿德巴兰的矮人提起这种想法。",
	"Among the eldest and grandest of the Delzoun holds, Citadel Felbarr was built more than three thousand years ago—a span of time beyond the ability of younger races to comprehend. With great wealth, obtained through profitable trade with Netheril and some of the older human settlements of the North, the dwarves forged themselves a mighty fortress.": "作为德尔祖恩最古老和最宏伟的领地之一，费尔巴尔城堡建于三千多年前--一个年轻种族无法理解的时间跨度。通过与尼瑟尔（Netheril）和北方一些古老的人类定居点进行有利可图的贸易，矮人获得了巨大的财富，为自己打造了一座强大的堡垒。",
	"Like most dwarven settlements, Felbarr was built around mining. With the fall of Netheril, the reduction of trade along the Lowroad, and signs that the mines beneath the city were reaching the end of their usefulness, the Felbarran abandoned the citadel after nearly two millennia, whereupon a force out of Silverymoon occupied the fortress shortly thereafter. Within half a century, the orcs had come to realize the weakness of the much smaller garrison, and Felbarr was taken by the savages following a four-month siege. The orcs gave the place their tribal name, and the Citadel of Many Arrows stood as a fortress for orcs for more than three hundred years.": "像大多数矮人定居点一样，费尔巴兰是围绕着采矿而建立的。随着尼瑟尔的沦陷，低路贸易的减少，以及有迹象表明城市下面的矿场已经达到了它们的使用年限，费尔巴兰人在近两千年后放弃了这座城堡，此后不久银月城的一支部队占领了这座堡垒。在半个世纪内，兽人已经意识到了这个小得多的守卫部队的弱点，费尔巴兰在四个月的围攻后被野蛮人占领。兽人给这个地方起了他们的部落名称，而 \"多箭堡垒 \"作为兽人的堡垒存在了三百多年。",
	"The recent story of Citadel Felbarr is the story of my fallen friend, King Emerus Warcrown. In 1367 DR, Emerus led a force of dwarves to seize on the advantage when, to our surprise and delight, another orc horde assaulted the orcs inside the Citadel of Many Arrows. Biding his time until the invaders broke down the gates, Emerus vanquished both tribes of orcs and reclaimed the citadel for the dwarves. After a first, brutal winter, Citadel Felbarr was restored: its forges were relit, and the sound of dwarven hammers began ringing through its halls once again. It was a proud time when we welcomed the following summer with Felbarr back in dwarf hands.": "费尔巴尔城堡最近的故事是我死去的朋友埃默勒斯-沃克伦国王的故事。在公元1367年，埃默鲁斯带领一支矮人部队抓住了优势，这时，令我们惊讶和高兴的是，另一个兽人部落袭击了多箭堡垒内的兽人。韬光养晦，直到入侵者攻破城门，埃默鲁斯征服了两个兽人部落，为矮人夺回了城堡。在经历了第一个残酷的冬天后，费尔巴尔城堡得以恢复：它的锻造厂重新点燃，矮人的锤子声再次开始响彻大厅。这是一个值得骄傲的时刻，我们迎来了下一个夏天，费尔巴尔重新回到了矮人手中。",
	"In the most recent war, the orcs again took Citadel Felbarr, but with the help of King Bruenor Battlehammer and an alliance of dwarves from across the North, King Emerus again retook Felbarr, slaying every orc that managed to enter the city and the tunnels below. The grateful king and his loyal warriors then agreed to accompany Bruenor to Gauntlgrym, and there aided him in reclaiming that ancient city as well, but Emerus was mortally wounded in the effort. Bruenor honored King Emerus by naming him the second king of restored Gauntlgrym (after King Connerad was granted the honor of first kingship posthumously), but for most Felbarran dwarves, this honor is an empty comfort, because their beloved hero-king has been taken from them.": "在最近的战争中，兽人再次占领了费尔巴尔城，但在布鲁诺-战锤国王和整个北方的矮人联盟的帮助下，埃默鲁斯国王再次夺回了费尔巴尔，杀死了所有设法进入城市和下面隧道的兽人。感激不尽的国王和他忠诚的战士们随后同意陪同布鲁诺去Gauntlgrym，并在那里协助他夺回那座古城，但埃默勒斯在这次行动中受了致命伤。布鲁诺为了纪念埃默鲁斯国王，任命他为恢复后的Gauntlgrym的第二任国王（在康纳德国王被追授第一任国王的荣誉之后），但对于大多数费尔巴兰矮人来说，这种荣誉是一种空洞的安慰，因为他们心爱的英雄国王已经被夺走了。",
	"Now ruling Citadel Felbarr are King Emerus's distant kin, King Morinn and Queen Tithmel, who were recently married in a union designed to join separate claims to the throne into one family. Tithmel's claim to the throne is the stronger by a small degree of kinship, but Morinn is a quieter, more thoughtful ruler. Queen Tithmel has ever been a warrior, and some Felbarran are afraid she may run headlong into the wrong battle before the couple can provide the realm with an heir, and so they hope that King Morinn's softer influence will help to temper her impetuous nature and keep the city strong through the trying times following the recent conflicts. Although the two monarchs share the rule of the city, and speak with absolute authority, their citizens are wise to listen to what both have to say before deciding how to act on royal edicts.": "现在统治Felbarr城堡的是Emerus国王的远房亲戚，Morinn国王和Tithmel王后，他们最近结婚，旨在将对王位的不同要求合并为一个家庭。Tithmel对王位的要求因一小部分亲属关系而更强烈，但Morinn是一个更安静、更有思想的统治者。蒂瑟尔女王一直是个战士，一些费尔巴兰人担心她会在这对夫妇为王国提供继承人之前一头撞上错误的战斗，因此他们希望莫林国王的柔和影响能帮助收敛她急躁的天性，使城市在最近的冲突之后的艰难时期保持强大。虽然两位君主共同统治着这座城市，并以绝对的权威说话，但他们的公民在决定如何对皇家法令采取行动之前，明智地听取了两人的意见。",
	"Most humans know Citadel Felbarr from a distance. They see only a great raised road winding through a vale of broken rock, brooded over by two barbicans known as the Hammer and the Anvil. Two other fortifications loom higher still over the road, embedded in the nearby cliffs and built atop them. These are the North Vigil and the South Vigil. Far beyond them, the massive Rune Gate stands at the end of the road to give entrance into Felbarr, but visitors rarely pass through it.": "大多数人类从远处了解费尔巴尔城堡。他们只看到一条巨大的高架路，蜿蜒穿过破碎的岩石谷地，被两座被称为 \"锤子 \"和 \"铁砧 \"的防御工事守护着。另有两座工事在道路上方隐约可见，它们嵌在附近的悬崖上，建在悬崖之上。这两座防御工事是北面的守夜人和南面的守夜人。在它们的远处，巨大的符文门矗立在道路的尽头，是进入费尔巴的入口，但游客很少通过它。",
	"Like most dwarven cities, Felbarr exists almost entirely underground. However, since it has been invaded by orcs more than once, no accurate maps of the city's full interior are known to exist, preventing would-be attackers from gaining their information. Dwarves, even those visiting from other realms through the connections with the Lowroad, have little trouble finding their way around, but humans, especially those who can't read Dwarvish or the shorthand runes carved throughout the city, have a far more difficult time.": "和大多数矮人城市一样，菲尔巴尔几乎完全存在于地下。然而，由于它曾不止一次地被兽人入侵，目前还没有关于城市内部全貌的准确地图，这使得潜在的攻击者无法获得他们的信息。矮人，即使是那些通过与低地的联系从其他王国来的矮人，在寻找他们的道路上也没有什么困难，但人类，特别是那些不能读懂矮人语或刻在整个城市的速记符文的人，则要困难得多。",
	"Following the war, most Felbarran applauded the dissolution of the Silver Marches. In its time of greatest need, no races other than dwarves moved even the slightest to aid Citadel Felbarr, when more assistance and better coordination might have prevented not only that citadel's fall, but Sundabar's as well. Felbarran merchants remain willing to trade with the cities of the North, and will aid the other dwarven kingdoms when necessary, but it is doubtful that Queen Tithmel will ever consider an alliance with humans like the one that created Luruar, even if King Morinn might.": "战争结束后，大多数费尔巴兰人对银色牧场的解体表示赞赏。在其最需要的时候，除了矮人之外，没有其他种族采取哪怕是最轻微的行动来援助费尔巴尔城，而更多的援助和更好的协调可能不仅会阻止该城池的陷落，也会阻止桑达巴尔的陷落。费尔巴兰的商人仍然愿意与北方的城市进行贸易，并在必要时援助其他矮人王国，但蒂瑟尔女王是否会考虑与人类结盟，就像创建鲁鲁尔的那个联盟一样，这是值得怀疑的，即使莫林国王可能会。",
	"The tale of the great North kingdom of the shield dwarves, the Dirge of Delzoun takes more than a day to sing in its entirety.

	"Gauntlgrym has a complex and contradictory history, the gist of it depending on who's doing the telling. Humans have one story, of what they know from recent years, but for us dwarves, Gauntlgrym is an ancient place, first delved as a mine in the earliest days of Old Delzoun. All sorts of myths persist about the great mithral doors of the city, but at its start, Gauntlgrym was simply a mine. When they delved too deeply, the dwarves there discovered the presence of a great being of flame, sealed the mines, and left. Only later, when the humans begged the Delzoun dwarves to build one, was there ever a city in Gauntlgrym. It arose because, this time, the dwarves succeeded in harnessing the primal power of fire in the depths, thus creating the Great Forge that made the city possible. Or so the stories go.": "Gauntlgrym有一段复杂而矛盾的历史，其主要内容取决于谁在讲述。人类有一个故事，是他们近年来所知道的，但对我们矮人来说，Gauntlgrym是一个古老的地方，在旧德尔祖恩最早的时候就作为一个矿场被挖掘。关于这座城市巨大的米塔尔门的各种神话一直存在，但在开始时，Gauntlgrym只是一个矿场。当他们钻得太深时，那里的矮人发现了一个伟大的火焰生物的存在，封住了矿井，然后离开了。后来，当人类乞求德尔祖恩矮人建造一个城市时，Gauntlgrym才出现了一个城市。它的出现是因为，这一次，矮人成功地驾驭了深处的原始火力，从而创造了大锻造炉，使城市成为可能。或者说，故事是这样的。",
	"Despite all the quests undertaken by adventurers down the centuries, none ever truly found the ancient city until the ghosts of Gauntlgrym's former denizens began calling to living dwarves to seek out the city. And some did—or tried to, anyway. Shortly thereafter, the orc wars began anew, and nearly every dwarf's attention turned back to the existing dwarfholds and the dangers those places now faced. Gradually, as the orcs were pushed back and the dwarven cities secured anew, those delvers began to recall their promises to their ancestors. Further, when the war ended, King Bruenor Battlehammer of Mithral Hall promised to lead the dwarves to Gauntlgrym and reclaim it for the dwarves of the North.": "尽管几个世纪以来，冒险家们进行了各种探索，但没有人真正找到这座古城，直到冈特格莱姆以前的居民的鬼魂开始召唤活着的矮人去寻找这座城市。有些人找到了，或者说试图找到。此后不久，兽人战争又开始了，几乎每个矮人的注意力都转向了现有的矮人家庭和这些地方现在面临的危险。渐渐地，随着兽人被击退，矮人城市重新得到保障，那些钻研者开始回忆起他们对祖先的承诺。此外，当战争结束时，米特拉尔厅的国王布鲁诺-战锤（Bruenor Battlehammer）承诺将带领矮人前往冈特格莱姆，为北方的矮人夺回它。",
	"It took fierce fighting to drive out the creatures that had claimed the city from below, and no one is quite sure who or what—aside from the drow—had tried to occupy Gauntlgrym, but in the end, the dwarven armies prevailed, and Bruenor claimed the victory. King Emerus Warcrown of Citadel Felbarr was gravely wounded, and Bruenor proclaimed him the second king of Gauntlgrym before his death. When dear Emerus passed on, Bruenor assumed the rule of Gauntlgrym, once again abdicating the leadership in Mithral Hall.": "经过激烈的战斗，才赶走了从下面夺取城市的生物，没有人很清楚，除了鸦人之外，还有谁或谁试图占领Gauntlgrym，但最终，矮人军队取得了胜利，Bruenor取得了胜利。费尔巴尔城堡的埃默鲁斯-华冠国王受了重伤，布鲁诺在他死前宣布他为Gauntlgrym的第二个国王。当亲爱的埃默鲁斯去世后，布鲁诺接管了Gauntlgrym的统治，再次放弃了Mithral Hall的领导权。",
	"There are some who think that King Bruenor has designs on a great, restored empire of Delzoun, with the dwarves of all the North—from Ironmaster to Adbar and Sundabar—swearing him fealty. Others fear that he will punish those settlements that didn't contribute warriors to the cause to retake Gauntlgrym, but those folk don't know the returned king very well. If he wants a reborn Delzoun, may Moradin and his children grant him the wisdom to do it right, and the fortitude to see it through. It's a throne I wouldn't wish on anyone.": "有些人认为布鲁诺国王有意建立一个伟大的、恢复的德尔祖恩帝国，让整个北方的矮人--从铁匠铺到阿德巴和桑达巴--向他宣誓效忠。还有人担心他会惩罚那些没有为夺回冈特格莱姆的事业贡献战士的定居点，但这些人并不了解这位回归的国王。如果他想要一个重生的德尔祖恩，愿莫拉丁和他的孩子们赐予他正确的智慧和坚韧的意志。这是一个我不希望别人得到的王位。",
	"The rise of a dwarven city so close to the coastal powers of Neverwinter and Waterdeep brings about its own special opportunities and concerns. Surely, once they get their forges going properly, the dwarves will sell armor and weapons similar to the excellent pieces they forged in the eastern cities of Old Delzoun, and this merchandise may lessen the demand for goods from more distant dwarven settlements. In particular, Sundabar is worried that its weapons will no longer be sought after along the Sword Coast, and is looking southward for new markets in Elturgard and elsewhere.": "一个离永夜城和水底城等沿海强国如此之近的矮人城市的崛起，带来了它自己的特殊机会和担忧。当然，一旦他们的锻造厂正常运转，矮人就会出售类似于他们在旧戴尔松东部城市锻造的优秀作品的盔甲和武器，而这些商品可能会减少对更远的矮人定居点的商品需求。特别是，桑达巴尔担心它的武器在剑海岸一带将不再受到追捧，并正在向南寻找埃尔图加德和其他地方的新市场。",
	"Beyond the great mithral doors of the city lies the great Iron Tabernacle, the holy center of Gauntlgrym, which the priests of all the Morndinsamman are meticulously restoring to honor the gods. Every portion of the city has a road or passageway that eventually leads back to this site, a vast cavern of crisscrossing walkways and great stairs. In its lowest levels, the Tabernacle holds the resting places of countless of Gauntlgrym's dead. Scholars have set about cataloging the lineages recorded here, to give King Bruenor a more complete picture of the bloodlines of the city, and to determine whether any of the living clans have relations or honored dead among those interred.": "在城市巨大的米塔尔门外，有一个巨大的铁幕，这是Gauntlgrym的神圣中心，所有Morndinsamman的祭司都在精心地修复它，以纪念诸神。城市的每一部分都有一条道路或通道，最终都会回到这个地方，这是一个由纵横交错的走道和巨大的楼梯组成的巨大洞穴。在它的最底层，会堂里安放着无数冈特格雷姆死者的安息之地。学者们已经开始对这里记录的血统进行编目，以使布鲁诺国王对该城市的血统有一个更完整的了解，并确定任何活着的部族在被埋葬的人中是否有亲属或尊敬的死者。",
	"Deeper still is the Great Forge of Gauntlgrym, where in times past hammers rang off adamantine anvils to forge wonders from every conceivable type of metal. Now the forge might be brought back to life again, and soon—the priests and spellcasters of the city are working on a means of containing the great heat emanating from the Fiery Pit where the being of pure flame is contained, to harness the unquenchable fire as the dwarves of old did.": "更深的地方是Gauntlgrym的大锻造厂，在过去，锤子在金刚砧上敲击，用各种可以想象的金属锻造出奇迹。现在，这个锻造厂可能会再次恢复活力，而且很快，这个城市的牧师和法术师们正在研究一种方法，以控制从装着纯正火焰的火坑中发出的巨大热量，像古老的矮人那样驾驭不可熄灭的火焰。",
	"Passed down by dwarves throughout the North for centuries, the Canticle of Gauntlgrym is now something of an anthem for the reclaimed city. It is often sung on the road by dwarven travelers on their way to make a life in Bruenor's halls.": "整个北方的矮人流传了几个世纪，《Gauntlgrym之歌》现在成了这座被开垦城市的颂歌。矮人旅行者在前往布鲁诺大厅谋生的路上经常唱起这首歌。",
	"Silver halls and mithral doors": "银色的大厅和米塔尔门",
	"Stone walls to seal the cavern": "封闭洞穴的石墙",
	"Grander sights than e'er before": "比以往任何时候都更宏伟的景象",
	"In smithy, mine, and tavern": "在铁匠铺、矿场和酒馆里",
	"Toil hard in endless night": "在无尽的黑夜中辛勤劳作",
	"In toast, oh, lift yer flagon!": "敬酒时，哦，举起你的酒壶！\"。",
	"Ye'll need the drink to keep ye right": "你需要喝酒来保持你的权利",
	"At forge that bakes the dragon.": "在烘烤龙的锻造厂。",
	"Come Delzoun, come one and all!": "来吧，德尔祖恩，来吧，所有的人。",
	"Rush to grab yer kin": "急忙抓住你的亲属",
	"And tell 'em that their home awaits": "并告诉他们，他们的家正在等待",
	"In grandest Gauntlgrym!": "在最盛大的Gauntlgrym!",
	"I've never set foot in Ironmaster myself, but I fought beside Storn Skulldark, a young warrior-priest of Clangeddin who was taking a sort of \"vacation\" from it in order to help reclaim Gauntlgrym. His descriptions of life in Ironmaster confirm much of what I've heard of the place, and so what I relate to you now is truth as solid as Moradin's anvil.": "我自己从未踏足过铁匠铺，但我曾在斯托恩-斯库尔达克身边战斗过，他是克兰格丁的一位年轻的勇士牧师，为了帮助收复Gauntlgrym而在那里 \"度假\"。他对铁匠铺生活的描述证实了我对这个地方的大部分听说，所以我现在向你讲述的是像莫拉丁的铁砧一样坚实的事实。",
	"The dwarves of Ironmaster don't want you there, and they want little from the wider world that their traders can't bring back for them. Approaches to the vale in which their city lies are clearly marked with the symbol of Ironmaster: an anvil on a diamond. Such a mark is your only warning, and those ignorant of its meaning court death at the hands of dwarf patrols that will attack any interlopers. Some innocents have been spared and turned back, but no one should rely on the mercy of a dwarf of Ironmaster.": "铁匠城的矮人不希望你去那里，他们也不希望从更广阔的世界中得到他们的商人不能为他们带回来的东西。通往他们城市所在的谷地的道路上，都有铁匠的标志：钻石上的铁砧。这样的标记是对你的唯一警告，那些不了解其含义的人将在矮人巡逻队的手中死去，他们将攻击任何闯入者。一些无辜的人被放过了，并被带回了家，但没有人应该依靠铁匠的矮人的怜悯。",
	"If you were to pass beyond the borders and into Ironmaster itself, you would behold one of the wonders of the world. The great Shaengarne river rushes through a deep canyon of rock and ice in a series of cascades and waterfalls, throwing up freezing froth as it bashes against massive spires of rock that rise from the riverbed. Ironmaster is built in these spires and into the walls of the canyon, the tunnels and towers strung together by high bridges and cliff-side walkways. To hear Storn talk of the place, you would think that dwarves scrabbling about at such heights through the open air was as normal as badgers in a burrow, but I don't mind saying I set aside my ale after he spoke of it.": "如果你越过边界，进入铁匠铺本身，你会看到世界上的一个奇迹。伟大的Shaengarne河在一连串的梯级和瀑布中冲过岩石和冰的深谷，当它撞上从河床中升起的巨大岩石尖顶时，抛出了冰冷的泡沫。铁匠铺就在这些尖顶和峡谷的墙壁上，隧道和塔楼由高桥和悬崖边的人行道串联起来。听斯托恩谈起这个地方，你会认为矮人在这样的高度上通过露天的方式乱窜，就像獾在洞穴里一样正常，但我不介意说，在他谈到这个地方之后，我把我的麦酒放在一边。",
	"Ironmaster owes its existence to the restlessness of Ilgostrogue Sstar, who left Citadel Adbar long ago with nearly a quarter of the population of the Northkingdom, headed for what is now Mirabar. By all accounts he was mad, and hoped to extend a dwarven empire to the sea. Once there, and settled, he grew restless again, and headed farther west with his troop, finally settling his nerves in sight of the sea over the Shaengarne River. There the dwarf leader died, and his heir demanded that the folk that followed him build a settlement in tribute to Clanmaster Sstar's grand vision of a dwarven empire. The dwarves found extensive deposits of iron in the hills surrounding their valley, and so named their city Ironmaster.": "Ironmaster的存在要归功于Ilgostrogue Sstar的不安分，他在很久以前带着北国近四分之一的人口离开了Adbar城堡，前往现在的Mirabar。从各方面来看，他都很疯狂，希望将矮人帝国扩展到海上。一旦在那里定居下来，他又开始不安起来，带着他的部队向西走得更远，最后在Shaengarne河上看到大海的时候，他的神经才安定下来。在那里，矮人领袖去世了，他的继承人要求跟随他的人们建立一个定居点，向族长Sstar关于矮人帝国的宏伟愿景致敬。矮人在山谷周围的山丘上发现了大量的铁矿，因此将他们的城市命名为铁匠。",
	"Ironmaster proved true to its name, and the dwarves have been tunneling out under to tundra for centuries, following the veins of metal. This brought them into contact with duergar of the Deepkingdom a generation back, and Ironmaster has been at war with them ever since. Storn was himself a veteran of many battles for tunnel territory, and despite being so young that not a hair of his beard was white, his knowledge of tunnel-fighting tactics rivaled my own.": "事实证明，Ironmaster名副其实，几个世纪以来，矮人一直在苔原下开凿隧道，沿着金属矿脉前进。这使他们在一代人之前就与深海王国的duergar取得了联系，从那时起，铁匠就一直在与他们交战。斯托恩自己也是为争夺地道领地而进行多次战斗的老兵，尽管他是如此年轻，以至于他的胡须没有一根是白色的，但他对地道战斗战术的了解可以与我相媲美。",
	"Their war with the duergar isn't Ironmaster's only secret, however. My friend Storn wielded two silvered axes, as befits any devote follower of Clangeddin Silverbeard, but when I returned to him an axe he had thrown in the heat of battle, I noted its remarkable weight, and Storn told me that the blade was not steel beneath, but adamantine. I questioned him more about this, and his readiness to tell me of its origin speaks to both the abundance of adamantine among the Ironmaster dwarves and of my friend's innocence about the wider world. Apparently, the dragon-worshiping humans of the distant island of Tuern have long given raw adamantite mined from their island to the smiths of Ironmaster, and they render finished works of adamantine back to the Northlanders in return. Of course, not all the adamantine makes it back to the Northlanders, but since the humans are ignorant of the means of forging adamantine, they are likely none the wiser. What a trove of arms and armor must lie hidden beyond Ironmaster's borders! Ah well, surely they put it to good use against the duergar.": "然而，他们与duergar的战争并不是铁匠的唯一秘密。我的朋友斯托恩挥舞着两把银色的斧头，这与任何虔诚的克兰格丁-银胡子的追随者一样，但当我把他在激烈战斗中扔出的斧头还给他时，我注意到它的显著重量，斯托恩告诉我，斧头下面不是钢，而是金刚砂。我向他询问了更多关于这个问题的情况，他愿意告诉我它的来源，这既说明了铁匠铺矮人中有大量的金刚砂，也说明了我的朋友对更广阔的世界的纯真。显然，遥远的图恩岛崇拜龙的人类长期以来一直将从他们岛上开采的金刚砂原料提供给铁匠铺的铁匠，而他们则将金刚砂的成品回馈给北地人。当然，并非所有的金刚砂都能回到北地人手中，但由于人类对锻造金刚砂的方法一无所知，他们很可能一无所知。在铁匠铺的边界之外，一定隐藏着一个多么大的武器和盔甲的宝库啊! 啊，好吧，他们肯定会好好利用它来对付杜尔加人。",
	"I don't think Storn will mind my sharing his city's secrets. You can go and ask him if you like. He'll no doubt enjoy another little \"vacation\" from the war in the tunnels.": "我想斯托恩不会介意我分享他城市的秘密。如果你愿意，你可以去问他。他无疑会享受到从隧道战争中获得的另一个小 \"假期\"。",
	"The ancestral home of Clan Battlehammer, Mithral Hall was a place of great potential wealth when it was founded in the days of Old Delzoun. Dwarves of Clan Battlehammer left Citadel Adbar, heading west in the hope of finding mithral deposits hidden in the southern spurs of the Spine of the World. These they found, and so began the delving of Mithral Hall, with Clan Ironshield founding Settlestone nearby as a means of buffering the market for the products of the hall's ore.": "作为战锤氏族的祖居地，米特拉尔厅在旧德尔祖恩时代建立时是一个具有巨大潜在财富的地方。战锤氏族的矮人离开了阿德巴城堡，向西走去，希望能找到隐藏在世界之脊南部支脉中的米塔尔矿藏。他们找到了这些矿藏，于是开始了对米特拉尔大厅的挖掘，伊伦斯盾部族在附近建立了塞特尔斯通，作为缓冲大厅矿石产品市场的一种手段。",
	"Mithral Hall enjoyed centuries of profit before its delving permitted the shadow dragon, Shimmergloom, to break through into the world. A settlement of thousands was reduced to fewer than three hundred—all of them too young, too old, too weak, or too ill to fight—who fled to Settlestone. There, they waited for months for word from King Garumn that their lands were again safe. When messengers to the city didn't return, it was clear that Mithral Hall had been lost, and its dwarves headed north, first to Ironmaster, where they were treated with such distrust that they couldn't remain, and then to Icewind Dale.": "在米特拉尔厅的研究允许影子龙--Shimmergloom--闯入世界之前，它享受了几个世纪的利润。一个数千人的定居点被减少到不足三百人--他们都太年轻、太老、太弱，或者病得太重，无法战斗--他们逃到塞特尔斯通。在那里，他们等了几个月，等待加伦国王的消息，他们的土地又安全了。当前往城市的信使没有回来时，很明显，米特拉尔厅已经丢失了，它的矮人向北走去，先是去了铁匠铺，在那里他们受到了不信任的对待，以至于他们无法留下，然后又去了冰风谷。",
	"When Garumn's grandson, Bruenor, was old enough, and sure of his path, he gathered allies to retake his former homeland, and went on a great many adventures with the group later known as the Companions of the Hall. At the end, Bruenor slew the dragon Shimmergloom and reclaimed Mithral Hall for Clan Battlehammer after almost two centuries.": "当加伦的孙子布鲁诺长大了，并且确定了自己的道路，他召集了盟友来夺回他以前的家园，并与后来被称为大厅同伴的团体进行了大量的冒险。最后，布鲁诺杀死了巨龙微光，在近两个世纪后为战锤氏族夺回了米特拉厅。",
	"After Bruenor regained the throne, his personal friends attracted some powerful enemies to Mithral Hall, including the drow of Menzoberranzan. This is one reason, his supporters claim, that the king abdicated in favor of his ancestor Gandalug Battlehammer: to protect the people from his personal enemies. Some of Bruenor's detractors claim it was wanderlust that made him leave, but none will bother (or dare) to ask him. In any case, when Gandalug died, Bruenor did his duty and resumed the throne.": "布鲁诺重获王位后，他的私人朋友为米特拉尔厅吸引了一些强大的敌人，包括门索布兰赞的乌鸦。他的支持者声称，这是国王让位给他的祖先甘达鲁格-战锤的原因之一：保护人民不受个人敌人的伤害。布鲁诺的一些诋毁者声称，是流浪的欲望让他离开，但没有人愿意（或敢）去问他。在任何情况下，当甘达鲁格死后，布鲁诺履行了他的职责，恢复了王位。",
	"Before Bruenor died, he was instrumental in gaining dwarven support for the Treaty of Garumn's Gorge, which brought peace between the dwarves and the orc Kingdom of Many-Arrows. When the orcs, in time, broke their treaty and made war on the North, he returned from the dead almost as though he had been summoned to rally the dwarves to defend themselves and punish their enemies. Some say he delayed receiving the rewards of Moradin's own Dwarfhome to return and aid his fellows and kinsfolk. Such sacrifice, such loyalty, makes a dwarf king worthy of the crown.": "在布鲁诺死前，他在获得矮人对《加伦峡谷条约》的支持方面发挥了作用，该条约为矮人和兽人王国 \"多箭 \"带来了和平。当兽人及时破坏了条约并向北方开战时，他几乎是死而复生，仿佛被召唤来召集矮人保卫自己并惩罚敌人。有人说，他推迟了接受莫拉丁自己的矮人之家奖励的时间，回来援助他的伙伴和亲属。这样的牺牲，这样的忠诚，使一个矮人国王配得上王冠。",
	"Bruenor Battlehammer, the Eighth and Tenth and Thirteen King of Mithral Hall, no longer leads Mithral Hall or the Battlehammer dwarves that live there. Since his return to life, he has refocused his attention on Gauntlgrym, and doesn't claim the kingship of his former home. Instead, the crown has been offered to General Dagnabbet Waybeard, granddaughter of Bruenor's ally, the great general Dagna.": "布鲁诺-战锤，米特拉尔厅的第八、第十和第十三位国王，不再领导米特拉尔厅和住在那里的战锤矮人。自从他复生以来，他把注意力重新集中在Gauntlgrym，并没有要求获得他以前的家园的王权。相反，王位被献给了达格纳贝特-韦伯德将军，布鲁诺的盟友、大将军达格纳的孙女。",
	"When last I visited Mithral Hall a few years ago, I passed through the rebuilt ruin of Settlestone, where a garrison of two hundred stands to protect the approach to the Mithral Hall. Once I reached the gates, the massive granite doors proved to be heavily guarded, and nearly impossible to open from the outside. Mithral Hall's defenders call themselves the Host of the Hall, a disciplined, well-armored cohort that is willing to defend the city to the last dwarf. The famed Gutbuster Brigade is part of the Host, battleragers who strike fear into any enemy intelligent enough to realize whom it is they face.": "几年前，当我最后一次访问米特拉尔厅时，我通过了重建的塞特尔斯通废墟，那里有两百名驻军，保护着通往米特拉尔厅的通道。当我到达大门时，事实证明，巨大的花岗岩大门戒备森严，几乎不可能从外面打开。米特拉尔大厅的守卫者自称是大厅的主人，这是一支纪律严明、装备精良的队伍，愿意保卫这座城市到最后一个矮人。闻名遐迩的Gutbuster旅是Host的一部分，他们的战斗力足以让任何有智慧的敌人感到恐惧，意识到他们面对的是谁。",
	"Travelers allowed inside the city are housed in upperlevel guest chambers just inside the labyrinth of caverns known as the Maze. From there, paths lead down into the middle levels of the city, past its various furnaces, and onward to either the lower levels and deeper mines (where guests aren't permitted) or the undercity (where non-dwarf visitors are prohibited).": "被允许进入城市的旅行者被安置在上层的客房，就在被称为 \"迷宫 \"的洞穴迷宫内。从那里，小路通向城市的中层，经过各种熔炉，然后前往低层和更深的矿井（客人不允许进入）或城市地下（禁止非矮人游客进入）。",
	"Despite its recent reputation and the growing legend surrounding its most famous king, Mithral Hall is much more a mine than it is a city. Like most dwarven realms, it lost significant numbers to the orcs, and saw its population further depleted by Bruenor's quest for Gauntlgrym and the resulting permanent relocation of some of his people. As a result, Mithral Hall's numbers are sorely diminished at present, and it remains to be seen whether its fortunes will follow suit.": "尽管它最近声名鹊起，围绕其最著名的国王的传说也越来越多，但米特拉尔厅与其说是一座城市，不如说是一座矿场。像大多数矮人王国一样，它在兽人手中失去了大量的人口，并且由于布鲁诺对冈特格莱姆的追求以及由此导致的一些人的永久迁移，其人口进一步减少。因此，米特拉尔厅的人数目前严重减少，它的命运是否会随之改变还有待观察。",
	"Like Mirabar, Sundabar was a dwarven settlement atop which a human city was built. Sundabar's recent fall should serve as an example to my fellow dwarves of what can happen when the balance of power shifts toward the surface and into human hands.": "和米拉巴尔一样，桑达巴尔也是一个矮人定居点，人类城市就建在它的上面。Sundabar最近的衰落应该成为我的矮人同胞们的榜样，告诉他们当权力的天平转向地面并落入人类手中时会发生什么。",
	"The city is descended from the citadel of Sundbarr, a stronghold of Delzoun constructed two thousand years ago around a strange volcanic rift that would come to be known as the Everfire—a mystical source of endless heat for the city's smithies and foundries that allowed Sundabar to produce works of great wonder. Sundbarr was led by a Forgemaster, the smith most skilled at working with the Everfire. When one Forgemeaster died or another surpassed his or her ability, leadership of Sundbarr changed hands.": "这座城市是桑德巴尔城堡的后代。桑德巴尔城堡是德尔祖恩的一个据点，两千年前围绕着一个奇怪的火山裂缝建造，后来被称为 \"永恒之火\"--为城市的铁匠铺和铸造厂提供无尽的热源，使桑德巴尔能够生产出巨大的奇迹作品。Sundbarr由一位锻造师领导，他是最擅长使用恒火的铁匠。当一位锻造师死亡或另一位锻造师的能力超过他或她时，桑德巴尔的领导权就会易手。",
	"So it was until the fleeing remnants of Ascalhorn were pursued to the citadel's doorstep some time later. Then the Forgemaster of Sundbarr aided the humans in fighting off the demons and other monsters that chased them. In recognition of a human saving his life during the fight, the Forgemaster permitted the refugees to settle on the surface, rather than forcing them to depart once the battle was done. The partnership that grew between dwarves and humans became renowned throughout the North, and the surface city of Sundabar was built up into a mighty fortress of commerce.": "就这样，直到一段时间后，阿斯卡霍恩的逃亡残余分子被追到了城堡的门口。然后桑德巴尔的锻造师帮助人类击退了追赶他们的恶魔和其他怪物。为了表彰人类在战斗中的救命之恩，锻造师允许难民们在地面上定居，而不是在战斗结束后强迫他们离开。矮人和人类之间的合作关系在整个北方都很有名，地面上的圣达巴城被建设成一个强大的商业堡垒。",
	"However, as the humans flourished above, the dwarf population dwindled, and eventually the Forgemaster was overtaken in prestige and influence by the Ruling Master of Sundabar, who came to speak for the human guilds and merchants of the surface city. One such ruling master, Helm Dwarf-Friend, was so beloved and respected that his descendants were able to crown themselves kings, something no dwarf before or since has dared to do in Sundabar.": "然而，随着人类在上面的繁荣，矮人的人口在减少，最终锻造师的声望和影响力被圣达巴的统治者所超越，他们来为地面城市的人类行会和商人说话。有一个这样的统治者，赫尔姆-矮人-朋友，是如此受人爱戴和尊重，以至于他的后代能够加冕为国王，这是之前和之后的矮人都不敢在桑达巴尔做的事情。",
	"King Firehelm, Helm's grandson, was the king in Sundabar when the city fell to the orc horde. He did not survive. Beyond that tragedy, the recent war did horrific damage to Sundabar and the humans on the surface. A dragon dropped great stones on many of the buildings above, and a good portion of the city's outer wall was destroyed. Most of Sundabar's military leadership was wiped out when the building they were meeting in was crushed. Despite the best efforts of Aleina Brightlance of Silverymoon's Knights in Silver to organize a defense, and the valiant efforts of the Sundabar garrison, orcs streamed into the city, slaughtering the human population on the surface and driving what few defenders remained into the caverns below, and from them many fled through the Underdark. The dwarves of the undercity barricaded themselves in the Everfire caverns, and waited. When the orc warlord Hartusk left only a token garrison behind in the city to slow pursuers, the dwarves emerged from below and set about slaughtering every orc and goblin in Sundabar.": "弗雷姆国王是赫尔姆的孙子，当桑达巴尔城被兽人部落攻陷时，他是该城的国王。他没能活下来。除了这场悲剧，最近的战争对桑达巴尔和地面上的人类造成了可怕的破坏。一条龙在上面的许多建筑物上投下了巨大的石头，城市外墙的很大一部分被摧毁。Sundabar的大部分军事领导人在他们开会的建筑被压碎时被消灭了。尽管银月骑士团的阿莱娜-布莱特兰斯（Aleina Brightlance）竭尽全力组织防御，而且桑达巴尔守军也做出了英勇的努力，但兽人还是涌入了城市，屠杀了地面上的人类，并将为数不多的守军赶进了下面的洞穴，许多人从那里逃到了地下世界。城下的矮人把自己关在长火洞里，等待着。当兽人军阀哈图斯克只在城中留下象征性的驻军以减缓追兵的速度时，矮人从下面走出来，开始屠杀桑达巴尔的所有兽人和地精。",
	"Sundabar is now a dwarven city in its entirety; the human population is gone. Efforts to clear away rubble and debris from the attacks are slow, as most dwarves remain in the sheltered undercity, and those few who have duties on the surface have taken over the buildings with the least damage, scavenging stones from ruined structures to reinforce those that can be salvaged.": "Sundabar现在是一个完整的矮人城市；人类人口已经消失。清理袭击造成的瓦砾和碎片的工作进展缓慢，因为大多数矮人仍然留在庇护的城市地下，而那些在地面上履行职责的少数人已经接管了损坏程度最小的建筑，从被毁坏的建筑中搜刮石头来加固那些可以被挽救的建筑。",
	"Before the war, Sundabar's surface streets were cobbled smooth, but many of those roads have been destroyed by falling stones, torn up for ammunition or to repair walls, or simply neglected. Now, the surface city is a hollowed-out ruin. Some believe that the city above will be allowed to wither into oblivion, with the exception of the sturdy double wall that surrounds it (and which the dwarves have already repaired). The temples of human deities stand abandoned. The walls are patrolled by a few sharp-eyed sentries, whose duty is to report what they see and to turn away unwanted visitors.": "战前，桑达巴尔的地面街道是用鹅卵石铺成的光滑路面，但其中许多道路已被掉落的石块毁坏，被拆成弹药或修理墙壁，或者干脆被忽视了。现在，地面上的城市是一个被掏空的废墟。有些人认为，除了环绕城市的坚固的双层城墙（矮人已经修复了）之外，上面的城市将被允许枯萎而被遗忘。人类神祗的庙宇被遗弃。城墙上有几个眼尖的哨兵在巡逻，他们的职责是报告他们所看到的情况，并将不受欢迎的访客拒之门外。",
	"In the center of the upper city, the Circle still stands around the ruin of the Master's Hall, ready to receive visiting caravans, livestock, and merchants. However, few such visitors arrive, and fewer still are welcomed, as Sundabar prefers to engage in trade nowadays only with other dwarven cities through the Underdark. Were it within the Forgemaster's power, he would see to it that all commerce entering and leaving the city do so by means of underground traffic, so that most surface trade routes could be abandoned entirely.": "在上层城市的中心，圆环仍然矗立在主人大厅的废墟周围，准备迎接来访的商队、牲畜和商人。然而，很少有这样的游客到来，更少有人欢迎他们，因为桑达巴尔如今只喜欢通过地下城与其他矮人城市进行贸易。如果在锻造师的能力范围内，他将确保所有进出城市的商业活动都通过地下交通的方式进行，这样就可以完全放弃大多数地面贸易路线了。",
	"Sundarren trust of outsiders is low, and their assessment of humans lower still. During the war, of all the human cities, only Silverymoon made any attempt to aid Sundabar, and that aid was (to dwarven minds) far too little and too late. As a result, with the Silver Marches dissolving, Sundabar wasted no time withdrawing from the Lords' Alliance as well, officially severing formal ties with the human realms of the North except for those necessary for trade. Given that such trade is now a rare occurrence, most of the human realms see Sundabar as jealously guarding its wealth and cravenly hiding beneath the surface, while the rest of the region does what it can to recover from the recent conflicts. Sundabar's losses in buildings and in population have done nothing to diminish the contents of its overflowing coffers, and despite its current state, the city remains one of the wealthiest in the North, though most of that coin rarely leaves the city now.": "Sundarren对外人的信任度很低，他们对人类的评价更低。在战争期间，在所有的人类城市中，只有银色之月（Silverymoon）试图援助桑达巴尔，而这种援助（在矮人看来）太少，也太晚。结果，随着银色牧场的解体，桑达巴尔也毫不犹豫地退出了领主联盟，正式切断了与北方人类王国的正式联系，除了那些必要的贸易。鉴于这种贸易现在很少发生，大多数人类王国都认为孙达巴嫉妒地守护着它的财富，疯狂地躲在表面之下，而该地区的其他地方则尽力从最近的冲突中恢复。Sundabar在建筑和人口方面的损失并没有减少其溢出的国库的内容，尽管它目前的状态，这个城市仍然是北方最富有的城市之一，尽管这些钱币现在很少离开这个城市。",
	"The notion of kingship has come up among the dwarves in the undercity, but the Forgemaster has rejected the idea. Let the dwarves tend to themselves, surely, but there should be no king in Sundabar. I don't know whether Flamestoker's reticence is false modesty or true wisdom, or if he is waiting for a warrior-king to claim Sundabar as part of a larger realm.": "城下的矮人中出现了王权的概念，但锻造师拒绝了这个想法。当然，让矮人自己照顾自己，但在桑达巴尔不应该有国王。我不知道Flamestoker的沉默是虚伪的谦虚还是真正的智慧，或者他是否在等待一个勇士之王将Sundabar作为更大领域的一部分。",
	"West of the High Road and hard to the coast near the Mere of Dead Men lies what humans refer to as Thornhold. Once the keep of a petty warlord of the Margaster family of Waterdeep, it was captured and claimed by a paladin as part of the Second Troll War. For many years the Knights of Samular, an order of Tyrran paladins founded by one Samular Caradoon, used Thornhold as its base, though the hold remained the personal property of the Margaster family.": "高路以西，靠近死人谷的海岸边，是人类所说的索恩霍德。它曾经是沃特迪普的马加斯特家族的一个小军阀的领地，在第二次巨魔战争中被一个圣骑士俘虏并夺取。多年来，萨穆勒骑士团，一个由萨穆勒-卡拉顿建立的泰兰德圣骑士团，将索恩霍德作为其基地，尽管这个地方仍然是马加斯特家族的个人财产。",
	"For a brief time a little more than a century ago, Thornhold fell into Zhentarim hands. When the Zhentarim marched through the Underdark to claim Thornhold, they passed through the caverns of Clan Stoneshaft, which had lived below since before the time the surface city was erected by humans. Though the Zhentarim killed or enslaved many of the dwarves there, they failed to destroy the clan. The survivors soon escaped, regrouped, and retook Thornhold by force under their leader, Ebenezer Stoneshaft, with the aid of Samular's descendant, the Harper Bronywn Caradoon. After the fortress was reclaimed, in a gesture of respect and gratitude, Caradoon bequeathed its custody to Clan Stoneshaft.": "在一个多世纪前的一段短暂时间里，Thornhold落入了Zhentarim手中。当Zhentarim穿过暗黑世界来夺取Thornhold时，他们经过了Stoneshaft氏族的洞穴，该氏族在人类建立地面城市之前就一直生活在下面。虽然赞塔林人杀死或奴役了那里的许多矮人，但他们没能摧毁这个部族。幸存者很快就逃了出来，重新集结，并在他们的领袖埃比尼泽-斯通沙夫特（Ebenezer Stoneshaft）的帮助下，用武力重新占领了索恩霍德，而萨穆拉的后裔，哈珀-布罗尼恩-卡拉顿（Harper Bronywn Caradoon）也在其中。堡垒被夺回后，为了表示尊重和感谢，卡拉顿将其遗赠给斯通沙夫特家族保管。",
	"The dwarves of Thornhold are all of the Stoneshaft clan, and because tunnels from their home connect to the castle, they refer to the place as Stoneshaft Hold; they use \"Thornhold\" only when a non-dwarf in a conversation is confused and an explanation must be made. By habit and nature, Stoneshaft dwarves are secretive (even for dwarves), but nonetheless always eager to hear what's afoot in Waterdeep, particularly any doings involving the Margaster family, whom they see as foes who will one day attack their home to regain it or destroy it if they can't take it back.": "索恩霍尔德的矮人都是斯通斯哈夫特家族的人，因为他们家的隧道连接到城堡，所以他们把这个地方称为斯通斯哈夫特城；只有在对话中的非矮人感到困惑，必须做出解释时，他们才会使用 \"索恩霍尔德\"。根据习惯和天性，石河子矮人很神秘（即使对矮人来说也是如此），但他们总是很想知道水底世界的情况，尤其是涉及玛格丽特家族的任何行为，他们认为玛格丽特家族是敌人，有一天会攻击他们的家园，以夺回它，如果他们不能夺回它，就会摧毁它。",
	"To most humans, Thornhold is merely the fortress above the surface, a castle of gray stone with a thick, curving wall and a two-towered central keep. They don't know of the caverns below that lead to the Stoneshaft clanhold. The cliff facing the sea is so sheer that no wall need be built to protect that side of the hill on which Thornhold sits. The castle is utterly without adornment or ornamentation, and only crenellations and arrow slits break the solid face of stone. Within the castle, surrounding the bailey, are small buildings of wood and plaster that hold animals and are used for smithwork, candlemaking, laundry, wood repairs (including wagons and the like), and brewing beer.": "对大多数人类来说，Thornhold只是地表上的堡垒，一座灰色石头的城堡，有厚实的、弯曲的墙和一个双塔的中央堡垒。他们不知道下面的洞穴是通向斯通斯哈夫特族人的。面向大海的悬崖是如此的陡峭，以至于不需要建墙来保护索恩霍尔德所在的那一面山。城堡完全没有任何装饰，只有石榴裙和箭缝打破了坚实的石面。在城堡内，围绕着堡垒的是一些木制和石膏制的小建筑，这些建筑饲养着动物，用于铁匠、制烛、洗衣、木材修理（包括马车等）和酿造啤酒。",
	"Long ago, Thornhold was a profitable stopover for caravanners, adventurers, and other travelers journeying north along the High Road past or through the Mere of Dead Men. For decades, the expansion of the Mere in the calamities of the Spellplague cut off most travel along the High Road. During that time, the Stoneshafts lived in relative isolation, stockpiling their ore, refined metal, and crafts. Stoneshafts are known for the fine metal- and gemwork they craft, considered by most to be works of art worn as personal adornment.": "很久以前，索恩霍尔德是一个有利可图的中转站，商队、冒险家和其他旅行者沿着高速路北上，经过或穿过死人谷。几十年来，在法术瘟疫的灾难中，死人谷的扩张切断了大部分沿高路的旅行。在那段时间里，石匠们生活在相对孤立的环境中，囤积他们的矿石、精炼金属和工艺品。石头人以他们制作的精美金属和宝石制品而闻名，被大多数人认为是作为个人装饰品的艺术品。",
	"The Margasters of Waterdeep believe that they still have a right to Thornhold. The fortress sits on the reestablished High Road leading to Neverwinter, so it is no wonder that the nobles wish to profit from the fortress's location along that route. The Knights of Samular also show interest in restoring their outpost at Thornhold as a prelude to sorties into the Mere, and there is talk that these desires may lead to a curious alliance between the grasping human nobles and the high-minded paladins.": "沃特德普的马格斯塔斯认为他们仍然有权利拥有索恩霍德。该要塞位于重建的通往永冬的大道上，因此难怪贵族们希望从该要塞的位置上获利。萨穆拉骑士也对恢复他们在索恩霍尔德的前哨站表现出兴趣，作为进入梅尔的前奏，有传言说这些愿望可能会导致贪婪的人类贵族和高尚的圣骑士之间的奇特联盟。",
	"Stoneshafts fear the politics of powerful Waterdeep will lead to an assault on Thornhold. They have thus been preparing for siege by gathering supplies and reinforcing Thornhold's defenses.": "石头人担心强大的水底世界的政治会导致对Thornhold的攻击。因此，他们一直在为围攻做准备，收集物资并加强索恩霍德的防御。",
	"Stoneshaft dwarves can taste the wealth, bustling energy, and constant excitement of nearby Waterdeep, and want to share in it. They don't want to be forced into isolationism, and kept away from Waterdhavian society and the riches of trade. The Stoneshafts aren't blind to House Margaster's ambitions, and they know that they must bring in profits if they hope to weather the challenges to their home. They're very careful to avoid being caught alone, fearing kidnap or torture at the hands of hired agents of the Margasters eager to learn the secrets of their defenses. For the same reason, only the Stoneshaft elders know and plan all the details of those defenses, so any single dwarf doesn't know everything and can't reveal it.": "石河子矮人可以品尝到附近水底世界的财富、繁华的能量和持续的兴奋，并想分享它。他们不希望被迫陷入孤立主义，远离沃特德社会和贸易的财富。石头人对马加斯特家族的野心并不盲目，他们知道，如果他们希望经受住家园的挑战，就必须带来利润。他们非常小心地避免单独被抓，因为他们害怕被急于了解其防御秘密的马格斯特家族雇佣的代理人绑架或折磨。出于同样的原因，只有石柱的长老们知道并计划这些防御的所有细节，所以任何一个矮人都不知道所有的事情，也不能透露。",
	"Stoneshafts like and are interested in the full variety of clothing and fashions, music, jokes and current news and rumors, and household goods and tools that Waterdeep offers. They tend to favor maces and morningstars and other bludgeoning weapons, plain armor with fullface helms that conceal a wearer's identity and that have plates to protect the vital areas of a knocked-down dwarf, and spicy foods.": "石头人喜欢并对水底世界提供的各种服装和时尚、音乐、笑话、时事新闻和传闻、以及家庭用品和工具感兴趣。他们倾向于喜欢长矛、晨星和其他打击性武器、带有全脸头盔的普通盔甲，这些盔甲可以掩盖穿戴者的身份，并有护板保护被击倒的矮人的重要部位，以及辛辣食物。",
	"What makes me such an expert on sailing off the sword coast? Well, experience, for one. survival, for another. I've been doing this longer than most of my readers have been alive, and this is the third version of this book I'm offering. I write one of these only every half-century, and if you think the purchase price isn't worth the heaps of coin you'll make by selling my work to your customers, you're a fool. Don't want it? Don't buy it.": "是什么让我成为在剑海岸航行的专家？好吧，经验是其一，生存是其二。我从事这项工作的时间比我的大多数读者都要长，这是我提供的这本书的第三个版本。我每半个世纪才写一本这样的书，如果你认为购买价格不值得你把我的作品卖给你的客户而赚取大量的钱，你就是个傻瓜。不想要它？那就别买。",
	"West of the Sword Coast lies the Sea of Swords, and beyond that the Trackless Sea, a vast expanse separating Faerûn from whatever lies to the far west. Between the shore and the unknown are a number of islands, some large and others so small they lack names of their own. These island nations trade—and war—with Faerûn and one another, just like any mainland nation.": "剑海岸以西是剑海，而剑海之外则是无轨之海，这是一片广阔的海域，将法鲁恩与遥远的西方隔开。在海岸和未知世界之间有许多岛屿，有些很大，有些很小，没有自己的名字。这些岛屿国家与法鲁恩和彼此之间进行贸易和战争，就像任何大陆国家一样。",
	"The information below is drawn from fifty years at sea, volume the third, by Gardorra Burr, a gnome sailor who has spent most of her two hundred years traversing the Sea of Swords.": "下面的信息来自于五十年的海上生涯，第三卷，作者是加多拉-伯尔，一个地精水手，她花了两百多年的时间穿越剑海。",
	"I don't know what the people of Mintarn did to attract Beshaba's ire, but they surely have her attention. For as long as I can remember, Mintarn has lived in the shadow of the dragon Hoondarrh—called the Red Rage of Mintarn since he dwells on an island close by—but for just as long, the people of Mintarn have been able to purchase the dragon's mercy. Now a series of events conspire to threaten their power to pay the dragon, as well as their other aspirations on the Sword Coast.": "我不知道敏塔恩的人做了什么来吸引贝沙巴的怒火，但他们肯定引起了她的注意。从我记事起，敏塔恩就生活在龙Hoondarrh的阴影下，他被称为敏塔恩的红色怒火，因为他住在附近的一个岛上，但同样长的时间，敏塔恩的人民能够买到龙的怜悯。现在，一连串的事件阴谋威胁着他们支付龙的权力，以及他们在剑海岸的其他愿望。",
	"Mintarn has long been a neutral ground for various forces—a place aloof from the conflicts between the citystates of the coast and the rivalries of the Northlander isles. Any ship—be it pirate, privateer, or merchant vessel—could dock at Mintarn and find a warm welcome. Many treaties were struck on its shores, and when peace couldn't be achieved, soldiers and ships of Mintarn hired themselves out to various power groups, with no fear of retribution on Mintarn.": "长期以来，明塔恩一直是各种势力的中立地--一个远离沿海城邦之间的冲突和北地岛国的竞争的地方。任何船只，无论是海盗、私掠者还是商船，都可以在明塔恩停靠，并受到热烈欢迎。许多条约都是在这里签订的，当和平无法实现时，明塔恩的士兵和船只就会被雇佣给各种势力集团，而不用担心在明塔恩遭到报复。",
	"Not long ago, Mintarn was awash with coin. Dagult Neverember invested heavily in the island, creating a ship-building company, combat-training facilities, and even lending his coin to the yearly tribute to Hoondarrh when other means fell short. The White Sails company in which he invested grew to become Mintarn's preminent supplier of mercenary ships and soldiers.": "不久前，明塔恩还充满了钱财。Dagult Neverember在岛上进行了大量的投资，建立了一个造船公司和战斗训练设施，甚至在其他手段不足的情况下，把他的硬币借给每年向Hoondarrh进贡。他投资的 \"白帆 \"公司逐渐成为明塔恩最主要的雇佣军船只和士兵供应商。",
	"Things only improved when Waterdeep wasted its navy chasing Northlander pirates. Then Neverember, acting as Open Lord of Waterdeep, relied on his connections to Mintarn to draft a new mercenary navy for the city. What's more, Neverember took it on himself to raise Neverwinter from the ashes, hiring more mercenaries of Mintarn to serve his needs as that city's Lord Protector.": "当沃特德普浪费了它的海军去追捕北地人的海盗时，情况才有所好转。然后，Neverember作为Waterdeep的公开领主，依靠他与Mintarn的关系，为该城市招募了一支新的雇佣兵海军。更重要的是，Neverember自告奋勇地将永夜城从灰烬中唤醒，雇佣了更多Mintarn的雇佣兵来满足他作为该城保护者的需要。",
	"With funds from two of the greatest cities of the Sword Coast filling its coffers, Mintarn knew a prosperity of which its people had never dreamed. It's true that the same tide that had coin flowing into Mintarn drew much of its young and vibrant people outward, but those they left behind were comforted by the knowledge that their family and friends didn't leave for war, but for much safer duties.": "随着来自剑海岸两个最伟大的城市的资金填满国库，明塔恩知道它的人民从未梦想过的繁荣。诚然，流向明塔恩的钱币的潮水将其大部分年轻而有活力的人们吸引到了外面，但他们留下的人得到了安慰，因为他们的家人和朋友并不是为了战争而离开，而是为了更安全的任务。",
	"The trouble started, not surprisingly, with Hoondarrh. Though Mintarn made yearly tributes to the great wyrm and was always careful to neglect not a copper, old Hoondarrh was known to sleep for decades at a time, and the folk of Mintarn took their agreement with the dragon for granted. But something awoke him early a few years ago, and it was as if the red bastard could smell the gold coming into the island. Although Mintarn had made proper tribute, Hoondarrh landed atop Castle Mintarn, toppling two of its towers with his weight, and roared a demand for more treasure, right then, and in future tributes.": "不出所料，麻烦是从霍恩达尔开始的。尽管明塔恩每年都向伟大的巫妖进贡，并且总是小心翼翼地不遗漏一个铜板，但众所周知，老霍恩达赫会一次睡上几十年，明塔恩的居民认为他们与龙的协议是理所当然的。但几年前，有什么东西提前唤醒了他，这个红色的混蛋仿佛闻到了黄金进入岛屿的味道。尽管明塔恩已经做出了适当的贡品，但霍恩达尔还是登陆了明塔恩城堡，用他的体重掀翻了城堡的两座塔，并咆哮着要求获得更多的财宝，就在那时，以及在未来的贡品中。",
	"Of course, the folk of Mintarn scrambled to meet the impatient wyrm's demands. Even if they had all the soldiers shipped away to Neverwinter and Waterdeep, what could they hope to do to mighty Hoondarrh?": "当然，敏塔恩的人民争先恐后地满足急躁的巫妖的要求。即使他们把所有的士兵都运到了永夜和水底，他们又能对强大的霍恩达尔做什么呢？",
	"Things got worse recently when Neverember was deposed as Open Lord of Waterdeep. The Lords of Waterdeep have decided to reestablish their own navy, and they've told the soldiers of Mintarn to leave the city or take a commission among the navy or the city's other armed forces. Now in Neverwinter, Lord Neverember has decided to do away with a mercenary force as well. He says he wants to instill a sense of civic pride among the folk of Neverwitner, but many in Mintarn see it as a betrayal. Neverember is a cunning man. I think with Hoondarrh active, the Lord Protector is simply cutting his losses. He didn't get the nickname Dagger just because his first name is Dagult.": "最近，当诺文伯被废黜为沃特德普的公开领主时，情况变得更糟。沃特德普的领主们决定重新建立他们自己的海军，他们让明塔恩的士兵们离开这个城市，或者在海军或城市的其他武装力量中接受委任。现在在Neverwinter，Lord Neverember也决定取消雇佣兵部队。他说他想在永夜城的居民中灌输一种公民的自豪感，但在Mintarn的许多人看来，这是对他们的背叛。Neverember是个狡猾的人。我认为随着霍恩达赫的活跃，保护者大人只是在减少损失。他得到小刀这个绰号并不是因为他的名字是Dagult。",
	"Mintarn had been playing the game well, but now it finds itself backed into a corner with few moves left to make. The coin is no longer flowing into its harbors, and many of its best and brightest have decided not to return. There's talk of hiring adventurers to slay Hoondarrh, but Hoondarrh's hoard must be massive. If that's not enough of a draw to dragon slayers, then there's no amount of money Mintarn could offer that would sweeten the deal.": "Mintarn一直玩得很好，但现在它发现自己被逼到了墙角，没有什么动作可做。金币不再流入它的港口，许多最好的和最聪明的人已经决定不再回来。有人说要雇用冒险家去杀胡安德，但胡安德的囤积物一定是巨大的。如果这对屠龙者来说还不够吸引的话，那么敏塔恩提供再多的钱也无法使交易变得更有意义。",
	"I like Mintarn. It has cozy inns, and they make a brilliant green wine unique to their island. But, there are safer harbors during the current storm. Maybe in another decade or two I'll try Mintarn again. In the case that you visit, here are a few other things you should know of Mintarn.": "我喜欢明塔恩。那里有舒适的旅馆，他们还酿制了岛上特有的灿烂的绿色葡萄酒。但是，在当前的风暴中，有更安全的港湾。也许再过一二十年，我还会再去试试敏塔恩。在你访问的情况下，这里有一些你应该知道的关于Mintarn的其他事情。",
	"Every five or six years, a new tyrant—yes, that's what they call themselves—emerges on Mintarn, ruling the island kingdom in the name of preserving its status as a neutral ground and a free port. A few years ago, Her Tyrancy was Bloeth Embuirhan, the supposed great-granddaughter of a tyrant from a century ago. She ruled the island through its most prosperous days, but odds are that the folk of Mintarn (and maybe herself as well, if she has her wits bout her) wants someone else on the throne now.": "每隔五六年，就会有一个新的暴君--是的，他们就是这么称呼自己的--出现在明塔恩，以维护其作为中立地和自由港的地位为名，统治这个岛屿王国。几年前，她的暴君是Bloeth Embuirhan，据说是一个世纪前的暴君的曾孙女。她统治着这个岛屿，度过了它最繁荣的日子，但明塔恩的人民（也许还有她自己，如果她有头脑的话）希望现在有其他人登上王位。",
	"Despite its open harbors and many fine establishments, Mintarn remains a loosely settled island. There are farms and homesteads, to be sure, but also wide, open spaces between them, and enough land that anyone could make a small living if so inclined.": "尽管有开放的港口和许多精美的设施，明塔恩仍然是一个松散的定居岛屿。可以肯定的是，这里有农场和家园，但它们之间也有宽阔的空地，有足够的土地，如果愿意的话，任何人都可以谋求小康。",
	"The Red Rage of Mintarn dwells in this mountain that rises from the sea north of Mintarn. I've never heard of any treasure hunters making it out alive, but those who give tribute to Hoondarrh say they sail into a sea cave and leave it on a sandy beach within. More caves are said to lead out from that bay, one even going straight up into the ceiling. Sometimes the tribute carriers can hear Hoondarrh's breathing from one of the caves: great inhalations, exhalations, and deep rumbles of slumber. When they can't hear such noises, you might think folk of Mintarn would be inclined to explore Skadaurak, but as it was explained to me, the lack of the dragon snoring might mean he is away hunting somewhere, but it could just as easily mean he is present, watching, and holding his breath.": "敏塔恩的红色怒火居住在这座从敏塔恩北部的海中升起的山中。我从来没有听说过任何寻宝者能活着出来，但那些向霍恩达尔进贡的人说，他们驶入一个海洞，把它留在里面的沙滩上。据说有更多的洞穴从那个海湾出来，其中一个甚至直接进入了天花板。有时贡品携带者能从其中一个洞穴中听到胡恩达的呼吸声：巨大的吸气、呼气和沉睡的深沉隆隆声。当他们听不到这样的声音时，你可能会认为敏塔恩的人们会倾向于探索斯卡达拉克，但正如有人向我解释的那样，没有龙的鼾声可能意味着他在某个地方打猎去了，但这也很容易意味着他在这里，在观察，并屏住呼吸。",
	"Cloaked in mists, the rocky cliffs of the Moonshae Isles rise high above the surf of the Sea of Swords, their tops clothed in ancient forests. The Moonshaes lie due west from Mintarn—and Baldur's Gate, and Candlekeep, and even Amn, for that matter: this great stretch of islands is nearly half as long as the Sword Coast, enclosing the Sea of Moonshae.": "在迷雾的笼罩下，月海群岛的岩石悬崖高高地耸立在剑海的海浪之上，其顶部被古老的森林所覆盖。摩恩沙群岛位于明塔恩的正西方向，还有博德之门、烛台镇，甚至安姆，都是如此：这一大段岛屿几乎有剑海岸的一半长，将摩恩沙海包围起来。",
	"On the southern isles live the Ffolk, humans ruled by their High King, Derid Kendrick, from the fortress of Caer Callidyr on Alaron. The Ffolk worship a goddess they call the Earthmother; her druids gather in sacred groves on the islands. Some of these groves hold moonwells, magical pools that the druids say the goddess uses as her windows onto the world.": "在南部的岛屿上生活着弗福克人，他们的大王德里德-肯德里克在阿拉龙的卡勒-卡利迪尔堡垒里统治着人类。弗福克人崇拜一位他们称之为大地之母的女神；她的德鲁伊们聚集在岛上的神圣丛林中。其中一些小树林里有月亮井，德鲁伊们说，女神把这些神奇的池子当作她观察世界的窗口。",
	"The northern isles are the territory of the Northlanders, who spread south from Ruathym to settle here, and have fought occasional wars with the Ffolk in the centuries that the two groups have uneasily shared the islands.": "北部岛屿是北地人的领地，他们从鲁亚西姆南下定居于此，在这两个群体不安地分享岛屿的几个世纪里，他们偶尔会与弗福克人发生战争。",
	"The largest and most populous isle of the Moonshaes is Alaron. The Ffolk stronghold of Caer Callidyr overlooks a bay south of the Fairheight Mountains, at the northern edge of Dornall Forest. The forest is a perilous place, filled with goblins, worgs, and their ilk. The deeper one goes, the more otherworldly the woods become, with fey creatures leading travelers astray—or to their doom. Even the High King's rangers walk the forest with care.": "阿拉龙是月岛中最大、人口最多的岛屿。卡勒迪尔（Caer Callidyr）是弗洛克人的据点，它俯瞰着费尔海特山脉南部的一个海湾，位于多纳尔森林的北部边缘。森林是个危险的地方，到处都是妖精、虫子和它们的同类。走得越深，森林就变得越古怪，精灵生物把旅行者引向歧途，或者引向他们的厄运。即使是大王的护林员也要小心翼翼地在森林里行走。",
	"Rumor has it the Rookoath dwarves of the Fairheight range—bolstered by Clan Rustfire of the isle of Gwynneth, and adventurers out of Callidyr—have won victories against the local orcs and their shadow dragon master. High King Derid hopes to forge an alliance with the dwarves, but thus far they have spurned the aid of the crown.": "有传言说，费尔海特山脉的鲁考特矮人在格温纳斯岛的锈火氏族和来自卡利迪尔的冒险者的支持下，赢得了对当地兽人及其影子龙主人的胜利。高等国王德里德希望与矮人结成联盟，但到目前为止，他们还拒绝接受王室的援助。",
	"Meanwhile, Kythyss, a port town on the Great South Head of Alaron, has been hiring mercenaries to guard caravans running north to Callidyr. Caravan masters there are always looking for help, if you're willing to brave the road for a while.": "同时，阿拉龙南面的港口城镇凯西斯（Kythyss）一直在雇佣雇佣兵来保卫向北前往卡利迪尔的商队。那里的商队主人一直在寻找帮助，如果你愿意冒着危险走一段路的话。",
	"Over my lifetime, the isle of Gwynneth has become ever more fey and mysterious, home to the elven realm of Sarifal, under the rule of High Lady Ordalf.": "在我的一生中，格温妮丝岛变得越来越有魅力和神秘感，它是萨里法尔精灵王国的家园，由大夫人奥达夫统治。",
	"Sarifal shares the island with the reclusive mountain kingdom of Synnoria, the home of the Llewyr elves, plus a few small shield dwarf settlements, and the ruins of Caer Corwell, the former Ffolk settlement on Gwynneth. High King Derid wants to reclaim the old citadel and rebuild it as an embassy, but has yet to secure Lady Ordalf's consent to do so.": "萨里法尔与隐居的山地王国辛诺利亚（Synnoria）共享该岛，辛诺利亚是勒维尔精灵的故乡，另外还有一些小的盾牌矮人定居点，以及格温纳斯上的前弗福克人定居点卡尔-科威尔的废墟。高等国王德里德想要收回旧城堡，并将其重建为大使馆，但还没有得到奥达夫夫人的同意，所以才会这样做。",
	"Gwynneth is also home to Myrloch Vale, a lush valley nestled in the mountains with the shimmering waters of the Myrloch to the south.

	"In the north of the island, High Lady Ordalf's son, Prince Araithe, leads the struggle against the darker fey of the forest of Winterglen.

	"The Korinn Archipelago is dozens of rocky, rainy, and windswept islands populated mostly by Northlanders, who herd sheep, fish the nearby waters, and occasionally go raiding or pirating.

	"There's no safe harbor for outsiders; you just have no idea what you are dealing with.

	"In recent years, a Northlander woman calling herself the Storm Maiden arose as a battle leader among them, which was unusual because Northlanders don't allow women to raid or fish. Said to blessed by both Valkur and Umberlee at her birth, the Storm Maiden gathered great numbers of Norls to her banner, and it seemed she might contest the king for control of Norland. However, a decade ago, she seemed to be consumed by the power of Umberlee, and she drove her followers on a mad quest to control the Sea of Swords. When at last she was defeated at sea, she and her ship vanished into the waves. She is known to be unable to drown, and many people fear her return.": "近年来，一个自称 \"风暴少女 \"的北地人妇女作为战斗领袖出现在他们中间，这很不寻常，因为北地人不允许妇女进行袭击或捕鱼。据说风暴少女在出生时受到瓦尔库尔和翁贝里的祝福，她将大量的诺尔人聚集到她的旗帜下，似乎她可能会与国王争夺诺兰德的控制权。然而，十年前，她似乎被Umberlee的力量所吞噬，她驱使她的追随者疯狂地追求控制剑海。当她最后在海上被打败时，她和她的船消失在海浪中。众所周知，她无法淹死，许多人害怕她回来。",
	"Rault the Wise, king of the Norls, lost both his elderly son Olfgaut and grandson in battles against the Storm Maiden, leaving succession in question. He has a granddaughter of great spirit and wisdom, but in the male-dominated Northlander society—and so soon after the disastrous rise to power of the Storm Maiden—it is unthinkable that rule should fall to her.": "诺尔人的国王罗尔特（Rault the Wise）在与风暴少女的战斗中失去了他的老儿子奥夫加特（Olfgaut）和孙子，使继承权成为问题。他有一个精神和智慧俱佳的孙女，但在男性主导的北地人社会中，而且在风暴少女灾难性地上台后不久，统治权就落到了她的手中，这是不可想象的。",
	"The last time I set foot on Oman's Isle was just after the Moonshaes had unified, and it was a peaceful, lovely place. It had sheep, farms, and fishing boats, and plenty of folk willing to trade the gold from their mines for goods from the mainland or other islands. Now, Oman's Isle is a blasted place is controlled by giants, especially fomorians, that hurl huge stones at any ship that comes too near the coast. If you do make it to shore, bring friends, and plenty of weapons—it's a dangerous place, but might be worth the risk. I can scarcely imagine the reward Jarl Rault or High King Derid would offer to the adventurers who reclaimed the ruins of Iron Keep, once home to the isle's rulers.": "我最后一次踏上阿曼岛是在摩恩赛人刚刚统一之后，那是一个和平、可爱的地方。它有羊群、农场和渔船，有很多人愿意用他们矿场的黄金换取大陆或其他岛屿的货物。现在，阿曼岛是一个爆炸性的地方，被巨人控制着，特别是福摩瑞人，他们向任何太接近海岸的船只投掷巨大的石头。如果你能上岸，请带上朋友和大量的武器--那是个危险的地方，但可能值得冒险。我几乎无法想象罗尔特伯爵或德里德大王会给开垦铁堡废墟的冒险者提供怎样的奖励，铁堡曾经是该岛统治者的家。",
	"The little isle of Snowdown, south of Alaron, is a possession of Amn, where Lady Erliza rules from Caer Westphal. She is the second of her name, noted for her striking resemblance to her great-grandmother, the first Amnian ruler of the isle.": "阿拉龙以南的雪绒花小岛是阿姆的属地，艾莉莎女士在卡儿-韦斯特法尔统治着这个小岛。她是她名字中的第二位，因为她与她的曾祖母--该岛的第一位阿姆尼安人统治者--有着惊人的相似之处而受到关注。",
	"Since taking possession of the place, Snowdown's occupiers have cut down its woods, stripped its mines, and choked its waterways with the refuse of the overworked Ffolk under their rule. Lady Erliza and her soldiers have ruthlessly put down several rebellions, and the Ffolk here refer to her as \"Bloody Erliza.\" Some Amnians believe the isle is becoming more trouble to hold on to than its diminishing exports are worth, and further uprisings are almost certainly brewing amongst the Ffolk, quietly supported by Alaron.": "自从占领了这个地方后，雪绒花的占领者砍伐了它的森林，剥夺了它的矿藏，用他们统治下的过度劳累的福尔克人的垃圾堵塞了它的水道。艾莉莎女士和她的士兵无情地镇压了几次叛乱，这里的福尔克人称她为 \"血腥的艾莉莎\"。一些安尼人认为，这个岛屿变得越来越麻烦，比其不断减少的出口更有价值，而进一步的起义几乎肯定是在Ffolk中酝酿的，并得到Alaron的悄悄支持。",
	"Well to the north of the Moonshaes and west of Faerûn are the home islands of the Northlanders, which exist as they have for centuries. The greatest of these islands, Ruathym, holds the oldest settlements the Northlanders claim, and from there, all manner of northern kingdoms and legends have sprung.": "在月海的北面和法鲁恩的西面，是北地人的家园，他们几个世纪以来一直存在。其中最大的岛屿--鲁亚西姆（Ruathym），拥有北地人声称的最古老的定居点，所有形式的北方王国和传说都是从那里产生的。",
	"The Northlander Isles are scoured by strong winds and powerful waves, and also suffer biting, bone-chilling cold for most of the year. In deepest winter, the inlets are choked with ice, and fog lingers late into the day, if it breaks at all. Most wear furs to keep out the cold, and those going to war supplement their protection with thicker hides, and helms lined with wool or fur. They disdain magic and glorify battle, to the point that most communities grow restless when they don't have an enemy to fight.": "诺斯兰群岛受到强风和巨浪的侵袭，一年中的大部分时间还遭受着刺骨的寒冷。在最深的冬天，海湾被冰封住了，雾气一直持续到深夜，如果它真的破了的话。大多数人穿着毛皮来御寒，而那些参加战争的人则用更厚的皮毛和衬有羊毛或毛皮的头盔来补充他们的保护。他们不屑于使用魔法，并以战斗为荣，以至于当他们没有敌人可打的时候，大多数社区都会感到不安。",
	"Because the Northlanders are good at fighting and sailing, and perfectly willing to attack ships close to their shores, best to be cautious around any Northlander Isles, especially if you haven't been assured of safe passage, and often even then.": "因为北地人善于战斗和航行，而且完全愿意攻击靠近他们海岸的船只，所以在任何北地人的岛屿附近最好都要小心谨慎，特别是在你没有得到安全通行保证的情况下，即使是这样，也经常如此。",
	"Northlanders pay homage to several deities, but they most honor Valkur, a hero-god of their own who exemplifies the qualities their warriors hold most dear. Take care not to question or insult this veneration in their presence.": "北地人向几个神灵致敬，但他们最尊敬瓦尔库尔，这是他们自己的英雄神，体现了他们的战士们最珍视的品质。在他们面前，请注意不要质疑或侮辱这种崇敬。",
	"While Northlanders revere many other gods—Auril, Umberlee, Talos, and Tempus, in particular—they see mighty Valkur as the most important. This hero-god is unique to the Northlanders and embodies the qualities that Northlanders most admire: fierceness, cunning, courage, strength, and sailing skill.": "虽然北地人崇尚许多其他的神--尤里尔、翁贝里、塔洛斯和坦普斯，但他们认为强大的瓦尔库尔是最重要的。这位英雄之神对北地人来说是独一无二的，他体现了北地人最崇拜的品质：凶猛、狡猾、勇气、力量和航海技术。",
	"The fisherfolk and merchants of Gundarlun are more like their mainland cousins than most island folk. Unlike other Northlanders, they are less apt to start a fight with folk they don't recognize. Because of their more peaceful bent, you're more likely to be able to safely get fresh water and supplies in Gundarlun, though you should be prepared to trade generously during your stop.": "贡达伦的渔民和商人比大多数岛民更像他们的大陆表亲。与其他北地人不同，他们不太会与不认识的人打架。由于他们更倾向于和平，你更有可能在贡达伦安全地获得淡水和物资，尽管你应该准备好在停留期间进行慷慨的交易。",
	"More than a dozen settlements pay homage to the king in Gundbarg. They profit from the island's reputation as a safe stopover. Though Gundarlun might not provide the best seaworthy warriors, nevertheless ship s that are looking to make repairs, take on sailors or sail-menders, or store large cargoes are likely to find their needs met here.": "在贡德巴格，有十多个定居点向国王致敬。他们从该岛作为安全中转站的声誉中获益。虽然贡达伦可能不会提供最好的适航战士，但那些想要进行维修、招募水手或补水员、或储存大宗货物的船只都有可能在这里找到他们的需求。",
	"If you seek shelter during a storm, you might find it in the many islands of the Purple Rocks. It was once my great fortune to find safe harbor at the port village known as Ulf of Thuger. The welcome I received was nearly as warm as I might have found among the Gunds, and I found the Rocklanders to be a fine audience for my tales of travel and adventure. However, something makes me think I shouldn't return.": "如果你在风暴中寻求庇护，你可能会在紫岩的许多岛屿上找到它。我曾经很幸运地在被称为图格的乌尔夫的港口村找到了安全港湾。我受到的欢迎几乎和我在冈德人中发现的一样热烈，而且我发现洛克兰人是我旅行和冒险故事的好听众。然而，有些事情让我觉得我不应该回来。",
	"On the day that the storm broke, I emerged from the longhouse in which I had been hosted and beheld a well-tended and organized settlement with green pastures and full fishing nets. The ship's crew and I were dealt with cordially by everyone, and the ship was already repaired and prepared for our leaving, the Rocklanders having apparently worked through the night to make it ready.": "在风暴爆发的那一天，我从接待我的长屋里走出来，看到的是一个精心打理的、有组织的定居点，有绿色的牧场和满满的渔网。船上的船员和我受到了大家的热情款待，船已经修好了，并为我们的离开做好了准备，洛克兰人显然已经通宵达旦地工作，使它准备就绪。",
	"We left on good terms, and it wasn't until we were well away that we realized we all shared a strange apprehension. We had not seen much of women while we were on the island, which was to be expected since Northlanders typically house guests well away from the homes, farms, and forges that are the Northlander women's domain. But we also neither saw nor heard any children or young men, and never once did we see any old men or women. Indeed, I hesitate to say that any man among the Northlanders we met had a single gray hair on his head or in his beard. This strange fact, and the Rocklanders' weird custom of giving any human figure in their art the arms of their totem—a many-tentacled squid—makes me leery of a return.": "我们在良好的条件下离开，直到我们走远了，我们才意识到我们都有一种奇怪的忧虑。我们在岛上的时候没有看到什么女人，这是可以预料的，因为北地人通常把客人安置在远离家庭、农场和锻造厂的地方，而这些地方是北地妇女的领地。但我们也没有看到或听到任何儿童或年轻人，也没有一次看到任何老人或妇女。事实上，我不敢说我们遇到的北地人中有哪个男人头上或胡须里有一根白发。这一奇怪的事实，以及洛克兰特人在其艺术中给任何人类形象配上他们的图腾--一只多触角的乌贼--的奇怪习俗，使我对返回感到恐惧。",
	"The island of Ruathym is the ancestral homeland of all the Northlanders who live on the islands of the Sea of Swords and the humans who would go on to found old Illusk, now Luskan, and spread out as the Illuskan people. The warlike folk of Ruathym know they have this legacy, and they consider rule over other Northlanders and the cities of the coast to be their birthright.": "Ruathym岛是所有生活在剑海岛屿上的北地人的祖先故乡，也是后来创建旧伊鲁斯克（现在的卢斯坎）并作为伊鲁斯坎人传播出去的人类的祖先。好战的鲁阿西姆人知道他们拥有这种遗产，他们认为统治其他北地人和沿海城市是他们与生俱来的权利。",
	"Merchants can occasionally trade with Rauthym at its capital city, also called Ruathym, but I don't risk such a stopover if I can help it. One never knows when Ruathym is going to be at war, and any ship within sight of the island when it is will be fair prey.": "商人偶尔可以在Rauthym的首都，也叫Ruathym，与Rauthym进行贸易，但如果可以的话，我不会冒险进行这种停留。谁也不知道Ruathym什么时候会开战，当它开战时，任何在该岛视线范围内的船只都会成为公平的猎物。",
	"Well to the west of its nearest neighbor, the remote island of Tuern is host to violent folk who raid and pillage at will and seek to enslave any outlanders they capture on or near their island. They trust no magic of any kind, and offer tribute to the red dragons and giants that dwell in the high mountain caves of this place. They have five kings, with a High King supposedly enthroned in their capital of Uttersea, but like any sailor with sense, I've avoided the island by a great distance, so I can't tell you which bloodthirsty knave currently rules the roost.": "遥远的图恩岛在其最近的邻居的西边，是暴力民族的宿主，他们随意袭击和掠夺，并试图奴役他们在岛上或附近捕获的任何外乡人。他们不相信任何形式的魔法，并向居住在这个地方的高山洞穴中的红龙和巨人进贡。他们有五个国王，据说有一个大王在他们的首都乌特海登基，但像任何有理智的水手一样，我已经远远地避开了这个岛，所以我不能告诉你目前是哪个嗜血的恶棍在统治。",
	"The tiny outcrops that make up the Whalebones are so numerous it's impossible to accurately chart them all. Each has its own legends and its own (often self-proclaimed) king, and they battle one another incessantly in skirmishes where the casualties number in the dozens, at most.": "构成鲸骨山脉的小山丘数量众多，不可能把它们都准确地画出来。每一个都有自己的传说和自己的国王（通常是自封的），他们在小规模的冲突中不断地相互争斗，伤亡人数最多也就几十人。",
	"The Whalebones are so called because of the scattered skeletons of those great sea creatures that litter the beaches of most of the islands. These bones are the only real commodity of worth these isles have—which means that anyone thinking to simply sail up and pluck ivory from the shores of the Whalebones is sorely underestimating how furiously its inhabitants defend their property.": "鲸骨岛之所以被称为鲸骨岛，是因为大多数岛屿的海滩上散落着那些伟大的海洋生物的骨架。这些骨头是这些岛屿上唯一真正有价值的商品--这意味着任何想简单地航行并从鲸骨岛的海岸上摘取象牙的人都严重低估了岛上居民对其财产的愤怒程度。",
	"If you're looking to purchase or repair a ship, there is no better place to do it along the Sword Coast than in Orlumbor. The finest shipwrights in the world live here, and their joining work is among the reasons Waterdeep remained so strong for so many years. Even when much of the city's navy lay disabled in its harbor, the strong ships of Orlumbor proved sturdy enough that folk could live on and in them while the city recovered.": "如果你想购买或修理一艘船，在剑海岸没有比Orlumbor更好的地方了。世界上最好的造船师都住在这里，他们的加入是沃特德普多年来保持如此强大的原因之一。即使当城市的大部分海军都瘫痪在港口时，Orlumbor强大的船只也被证明是足够坚固的，以至于在城市恢复的时候，人们可以在其中生活。",
	"Orlumbor was once a simple shipwright island, supplying the city-states of the Sword Coast with vessels for their navies. Waterdeep in particular relied on Orlumbor to supply ships for its defense, making the island a wealthy and well-protected place in return. When Lord Neverember sank Waterdeep's navy in his fight against pirates, he arranged to hire mercenary ships to replace the force, funneling ill-gotten proceeds into his own pockets, and leaving both the coffers and the shipyards of Orlumbor high and dry. After Neverember's ouster, Waterdeep's business returned, and with it much of the isle's prosperity.": "奥伦堡曾经是一个简单的船工岛，为剑海岸的城邦提供海军船只。沃特德普尤其依赖奥伦堡为其防御提供船只，使该岛成为一个富裕和受到良好保护的地方作为回报。当诺文柏领主在打击海盗的过程中击沉了沃特迪普的海军，他安排雇用雇佣兵船只来取代这支部队，将不义之财放入自己的口袋，而让奥伦堡的国库和船厂都变得高枕无忧。在纽伦堡下台后，沃特迪普的生意恢复了，岛内的繁荣也随之而来。",
	"Reaching Orlumbor by ship is tricky because of the rocky, cavernous approach to the harbor. Once a ship navigates the route properly, it can find a wider berth, and any minor damage to the new visitor is happily (and cheaply) repaired by the Orlumbor dockworkers. These are folk born and bred to work on ships. The homes on Orlumbor are built into the caverns of the island, and just as well defended as the docks that are its life's blood.": "乘船到达Orlumbor是很棘手的，因为通往港口的道路上有很多岩石和洞窟。一旦船只正确地航行，它就能找到一个更宽阔的泊位，任何对新来者的小损伤都会被Orlumbor的码头工人愉快地（和廉价地）修复好。这些人都是在船上出生和长大的。奥伦堡的住宅建在岛上的岩洞里，和作为其生命之源的码头一样得到了很好的保护。",
	"More than once down the years, Waterdeep's protection has kept Orlumbor from falling to Mintarn, Luskan, Amn, or Baldur's Gate, all of which have sought to claim the islands and its shipyards for their own. None of these other places ever considered that Orlumbor might simply choose not to build ships for them, but thankfully, it's never come to that. Now, Orlumbor once again serves Waterdeep, in exchange for coin, foodstuffs, and other goods from Faerûn.": "多年来，沃特德普的保护使Orlumbor没有落入Mintarn、Luskan、Amn或Baldur's Gate之手，这些地方都曾试图将岛屿及其造船厂据为己有。这些地方都没有考虑过奥伦堡可能只是选择不为他们造船，但幸运的是，这一切都没有发生。现在，Orlumbor再次为Waterdeep服务，以换取Faerûn的硬币、食品和其他物品。",
	"Off the coast of the southern realms of Faerûn, even south of the Moonshae Isles, are some smaller, less influential island nations. The Nelanther, just across Asavir's Channel from Tethyr, is a land of raiding pirates. Farther south, some three hundred miles from the Moonshaes, is the fabled island of Lantan, birthplace of many odd inventions. Well south of there, beyond the jungles of Chult, is the mysterious island of Nimbral.": "在法鲁恩南部王国的海岸边，甚至在月牙岛以南，有一些规模较小、影响力较小的岛国。内兰瑟（Nelanther）与泰特希尔（Tethyr）隔着阿萨维尔（Asavir）海峡相望，是一片海盗袭击的土地。在更远的南方，距离月海岛约300英里处，是传说中的兰坦岛，是许多奇特发明的诞生地。再往南，在楚尔特的丛林之外，是神秘的宁布拉尔岛。",
	"I had not visited Lantan for over a year when it happened, but the way most tell it, when magic failed utterly in this place, all the stored smokepowder and magical gewgaws in Lantan exploded, one by one, just as great waves washed over the island. Within a terrifyingly short time, Lantan was no more.": "事情发生时，我已经有一年多没去兰坦岛了，但根据大多数人的说法，当魔法在这个地方彻底失效时，兰坦岛所有储存的烟火药和魔法道具都爆炸了，一个接一个，就像大浪冲到了岛上。在一个可怕的短时间内，兰坦岛不复存在。",
	"Or so the stories of survivors went. It appears now that Lantan was transferred to another world, much like Halruaa. Halruua, though, had foreseen the calamity and taken time to prepare. Lantan was not so lucky.": "或者说，幸存者的故事是这样的。现在看来，兰坦被转移到了另一个世界，和哈尔鲁阿很像。不过，哈尔鲁阿已经预见到了这场灾难，并花时间做了准备。兰坦就没那么幸运了。",
	"The Lantanese were fascinated—some say obsessed—with building mechanical wonders. Though they employed magic from time to time, the whole island smelled like sawdust, grease, and freshly scraped metal, as shop after shop worked on refining its latest and greatest invention. The new creation might have been little metal knights that walk and fight and knock each other over, elaborate coffers with locks that latch themselves, or mechanical arms that copy what a scribe is writing onto a second sheet of parchment. During my past visits there, I'd seen all of those and more with my own eyes.": "兰特人对制造机械奇迹非常着迷，有人说是痴迷。虽然他们时常使用魔法，但整个岛屿都散发着锯末、油脂和刚刮过的金属的味道，因为一个又一个的商店都在努力完善其最新和最伟大的发明。新发明可能是会走路、会打架、会互相碰撞的小金属骑士，精心制作的带有锁的库房，或者将抄写员正在写的东西复制到第二张羊皮纸上的机械手臂。在我过去的访问中，我亲眼看到了所有这些和更多。",
	"Were these gewgaws and trifles of help to the Lantanese when the whole world was ripped from under them? To whom did they turn when in that other world their prayers to their favored god, Gond, went unanswered? What happened in their century away, and now that they are returned, are they happy to be here, or does it seem like their world has once more been ripped away?": "当整个世界从他们脚下被撕碎时，这些小玩意和琐事对兰特人有帮助吗？当他们在另一个世界向他们所喜爱的神--冈德--的祈祷没有得到回应时，他们向谁求助？在他们离开的一个世纪里发生了什么，现在他们回来了，他们是高兴地来到这里，还是觉得他们的世界又一次被撕裂了？",
	"Some ships claiming to be from returned Lantan have appeared in ports along the Sword Coast, but from what I hear, the Lantanese who emerge from them are guarded and say little about their homeland. These traders seek to attain large quantities of raw materials such as various types of woods and metals, trading unusual gems and strange gold coins in return. Of their inventions, folks have seen little, but the few glimpses attained have fueled much speculation about Lantan's development of smokepowder weapons and greater willingness to blend magic with machinery. Indeed, Lantanese traders have reportedly offered many shield guardians in private auctions up and down the Sword Coast, and such golem-like constructs are usually the province of wizards, not tinkerers.": "一些自称来自回国的兰坦的船只出现在剑海岸的港口，但据我所知，从这些船上出来的兰坦人都很警惕，对自己的家乡几乎不说。这些商人寻求获得大量的原材料，如各种类型的木材和金属，用不寻常的宝石和奇怪的金币作为回报。对于他们的发明，人们所见甚少，但仅有的几处瞥见，却让人们对兰坦发展烟火药武器和更愿意将魔法与机械结合的做法产生了许多猜测。事实上，据说兰坦商人在剑海岸上下的私人拍卖会上提供了许多盾牌守护者，而这种类似魔像的建筑通常是巫师的专利，而不是工匠的专利。",
	"Take an old salt's advice and beware the Pirate Isles of the Sea of Swords, the Nelanther. Here, all manner of seafaring or sea-dwelling creatures live, from lizardfolk and minotaurs to orcs and ogres, with a smattering of humans and others thrown in for variety. Where some pirates hold to their own code of conduct, the folk of Nelanther care nothing for rules, honor, or even good, neighborly sense: they attack each another as often and as viciously as they do any passing ship or convoy. Simply put, the Nelanther Isles are a chain of reavers and raiders, who eke out a living fighting whomever they can find.": "听从一位老者的建议，小心剑海的海盗岛，即尼兰特。在这里，生活着各种类型的航海或海居生物，从蜥蜴人和牛头人到兽人和食人魔，还有零星的人类和其他生物。有些海盗坚持他们自己的行为准则，而内兰瑟的居民则不在乎规则、荣誉，甚至是良好的邻里关系：他们互相攻击，就像他们攻击任何过往的船只或船队一样频繁和凶狠。简而言之，尼兰特群岛是一个由掠夺者和袭击者组成的链条，他们靠与任何他们能找到的人战斗来谋生。",
	"No one's ever bothered to count or name all the tribes of these islands, and I doubt anyone's going to start now. For one thing, it's a fool's errand: tribes split up or are destroyed at such a rapid pace that by the time you finished counting, you'd have to start over anyway. For another, it's dirty, dangerous work, and dealing with pirates is a task best left to swift ships, well-armed navies, and the kinds of fools that would want to count them in the first place.": "从来没有人费心去统计或命名这些岛屿的所有部落，我怀疑现在也不会有人开始。首先，这是一个愚蠢的任务：部落分裂或被摧毁的速度如此之快，以至于当你完成统计时，你不得不重新开始。另外，这是一项肮脏、危险的工作，对付海盗的任务最好留给快速的船只、装备精良的海军，以及那些一开始就想计算他们的傻瓜。",
	"If you do find out the name of a tribe in the Nelanther, be careful about mentioning it to another Nelanther ship unless you can confirm that the ship belongs to a friendly tribe. Even so, be advised that alliances are short as summer storms in these isles, and it's not likely you'll be around long enough to witness a new one being forged. Proclaiming your allegiance to a certain tribe might anger the one you're talking to.": "如果你在尼兰特发现了一个部落的名字，要小心向另一艘尼兰特船提到它，除非你能确认该船属于一个友好部落。即便如此，请注意，在这些岛屿上，联盟就像夏天的暴风雨一样短暂，你不可能在这里待足够长的时间来见证一个新的联盟的形成。宣称你效忠于某个部落可能会激怒与你交谈的人。",
	"Still, if you're looking for cheap, strong hands, Nelanther may be the place for you, but don't expect much in the way of loyalty or cleverness out of them. Hiring too many Nelanther sailors on a ship is just asking for your ship to be taken from you, sailed back to the islands, and given new life as a pirate vessel.": "不过，如果你正在寻找廉价的、强壮的手，尼兰特可能是你的地方，但不要指望他们有多大的忠诚度或聪明才智。在一艘船上雇佣太多尼兰特水手，只会让你的船被夺走，驶回岛屿，并作为海盗船获得新的生命。",
	"Ever seen an island simply disappear? That is, supposedly, what happened to Nimbral at about the time Lantan drowned, or so they say. Four ship captains of my acquaintance claim to have seen it one moment, and then not seen it the next, and sailed straight through its former location as though it was never there.": "见过一个岛屿简单地消失吗？据称，这就是尼姆布拉尔在兰坦溺水时发生的事情，或者说是他们所说的。我认识的四位船长声称，他们一会儿看到它，一会儿又看不到它，并直接驶过它以前的位置，好像它从来没有出现过。",
	"Some claim that powerful magic moved or hid the island in a vast illusion. That I find believable, because the Lords of Nimbral have long been known for illusion and trickery. If any isle were to vanish into thin air, it would be theirs. Likewise, Nimbral's return is certainly within their capabilities, and perhaps this event is the climax of a trick so long and complex that even a gnome can envy its scope.": "有些人声称，强大的魔法移动了岛屿，或将其隐藏在一个巨大的幻觉中。我认为这是可信的，因为尼姆布拉尔的领主长期以来一直以幻觉和诡计闻名。如果有任何岛屿消失在空气中，那将是他们的岛屿。同样，尼姆布拉尔的回归肯定也在他们的能力范围之内，也许这个事件是一个漫长而复杂的诡计的高潮，甚至连地精都会羡慕它的范围。",
	"Nimbral today is much as it has always been: far-flung and secretive. Where the island went, what it did while gone, and why it came back all seem to be facts the Lords of Nimbral prefer to keep to themselves.": "今天的Nimbral和往常一样：遥远而神秘。岛屿去了哪里，它在离开时做了什么，以及它为什么回来，似乎都是宁布拉尔的领主们宁愿自己保留的事实。",
	"Nimbral is still ruled by its mysterious lords, a closely related family of archmages, master illusionists all. They in turn appoint the heralds, who proclaim the laws, and the Knights of Nimbral, fabled hippogriff riders clad in armor clear as glass but strong as steel. Don't let the fact that they are called knights fool you. The Knights of Nimbral have always acted as pirates when out on patrol over the seas, preying on ships that strayed close to their island.": "Nimbral仍然由其神秘的领主统治着，他们是一个关系密切的大法师家族，都是幻术大师。他们反过来任命传令官，宣布法律，并任命尼姆布拉尔的骑士，传说中的河马骑士，穿着像玻璃一样透明但像钢铁一样坚固的铠甲。不要让他们被称为骑士的事实欺骗了你。尼姆布拉尔骑士在出海巡逻时一直扮演着海盗的角色，掠夺那些靠近他们岛屿的船只。",
	"What my captain friends were doing in waters so close to Nimbral they did not disclose. \"Business\" was all they'd say, but no one has business so far south as Nimbral, unless they expect to dock at the island. Alas, in the time since we last spoke, all those captains have died, and I can't question them further about what they know of the place.": "我的船长朋友们在离宁布拉尔这么近的水域里做什么，他们没有透露。他们只说 \"做生意\"，但没有人的生意能做到离宁布拉尔这么远，除非他们想在岛上停靠。唉，自从我们上次谈话以来，所有这些船长都死了，我无法进一步询问他们对这个地方的了解。",
	"If you have cause to sail south by Chult, keep a wary eye on the skies. It might not help, since the Knight of Nimbral have been known to appear out of nowhere, apparently invisible before they attacked, but it pays to be cautious when you're doing something foolish.": "如果你有理由从楚尔特向南航行，请警惕地注视着天空。这可能没有帮助，因为宁布拉尔骑士已经知道会突然出现，在他们攻击之前显然是看不见的，但当你做一些愚蠢的事情时，要小心谨慎。",
	"What I tell you now is truth as pure as Garl's nugget, and the only reason I've written it in a book for all to see is that no one else shall ever achieve the feat: I stowed away on a ship bound for Evermeet, and my feet touched its blessed ground!": "我现在告诉你的是像加尔的金块一样纯粹的事实，我把它写在书里让大家看到的唯一原因是，没有人能够实现这一壮举：我在一艘开往Evermeet的船上偷渡，我的脚触到了它的福地！\"。",
	"Any who're knowledgeable about the place might scoff at my claim, and those ignorant of it like as not think the deed not the feat of legend it was, so let me explain to those doubters among you what Evermeet is and why, by the end of my tale, you'll envy my boots.": "对这个地方有了解的人可能会嘲笑我的说法，那些对它一无所知的人也不会认为这个事迹不是传说中的壮举，所以让我向你们中那些怀疑者解释什么是Evermeet，以及为什么在我的故事结束时，你们会羡慕我的靴子。",
	"Legend has it—and so believes every elf I've ever met—that the island of Evermeet is not of this world, and that it never was. In ancient days, so long ago that even elves think of it as their mythic past, the elves of many nations sought a perfect homeland for their people. (That was the problem there, of course. You'll miss out on a wealth of beauty it you're always looking for the perfect gem.) Not finding it in the world, some elves (sun elves, I'd wager) looked beyond the world to create one. These High Mages gathered together to perform a mighty work of magic that would bring Toril into contact with Arvandor—that's right, the mad fools actually wanted to bring into our world some of the lands in which their gods dwelt!": "传说--我见过的每个精灵都这么认为--永恒之岛不属于这个世界，而且它从来都不是。在远古时代，如此之久，以至于连精灵都认为这是他们神话般的过去，许多国家的精灵为他们的人民寻求一个完美的家园。(当然，那是那里的问题）。如果你一直在寻找完美的宝石，你会错过丰富的美景）。在这个世界上找不到它，一些精灵（太阳精灵，我敢打赌）把目光投向了世界之外，以创造一个。这些高级法师们聚集在一起，执行一项强大的魔法工作，将使托里尔与阿凡多接触--没错，这些疯狂的傻瓜居然想把他们的神灵所居住的一些土地带到我们的世界中来！这就是他们的目的。",
	"Tales differ on whether Corellon allowed this or was powerless to prevent it, but it happened, and calamity gripped Toril as a result. This was the first Sundering, and elves have always said it echoed through time. Recent calamities would seem to prove them right.": "关于科瑞隆是允许这样做还是无力阻止这样做的说法不一，但它发生了，灾难因此笼罩了托里尔。这是第一次毁灭，精灵们总是说它在时间中回响。最近的灾难似乎证明他们是对的。",
	"When things settled down, the elves realized their folly. For thousands of years, no elf dared set foot on Evermeet. But eventually Corellon must have forgiven his wayward children, for the oldest elves began to feel the call to the west.": "当事情稳定下来后，精灵们意识到他们的愚蠢。几千年来，没有精灵敢于踏上Evermeet。但最终科雷隆一定是原谅了他那不听话的孩子们，因为最古老的精灵开始感受到对西部的召唤。",
	"Perhaps you've seen a moonbow hang over Selûne and heard the idea that it means an elf is being called to Evermeet. Well, that is no children's story. Ever met an elderly elf? How would you know, right? Well if you're ever honored to meet an elderly elf at such a time, you'll see a similar arc in each of the elf's eyes above the pupil. This is Sehanine Moonbow's way of guiding the elf to the afterlife. The arcs can blind the elf to this world, but they vanish when the elf enters the next, allowing sight of the elven heaven. Well that's exactly what happens in Evermeet, and the elf need not be dead to achieve it. Don't believe me? Well, I saw what I saw.": "也许你已经看到了悬挂在塞卢恩上空的月弓，并听到了这样的说法：这意味着一个精灵正被召唤到Evermeet。好吧，这可不是小孩子的故事。你见过一个年老的精灵吗？你怎么会知道，对吗？好吧，如果你有幸在这种时候遇到一个年长的精灵，你会看到每个精灵的瞳孔上方都有一个类似的弧度。这是Sehanine Moonbow引导精灵来世的方式。这些弧线可以使精灵在这个世界上失明，但当精灵进入下一个世界时，它们就会消失，让人看到精灵的天堂。这正是在Evermeet发生的事情，而且精灵不需要死就能实现。不相信我？好吧，我看到了我所看到的。",
	"Some elves followed their aged kin to Evermeet, and soon a kingdom of elves dwelt in a heaven on Toril. For ages Evermeet was protected by mighty beasts, mighty magic, and the might of the Seldarine themselves. Elves of all types from all over the world journeyed to Evermeet seeking solace. And when the elves declared their Retreat from the world, where do you think they went?": "一些精灵跟随他们年迈的亲属来到了Evermeet，很快一个精灵王国就在Toril的天堂里居住了下来。长久以来，Evermeet受到强大的野兽、强大的魔法和Seldarine本身的力量的保护。来自世界各地的各种类型的精灵都到Evermeet寻求慰藉。当精灵们宣布从世界上撤退时，你认为他们会去哪里？",
	"Then the Spellplague struck, and some of that old elven High Magic must have unraveled. Evermeet became unmoored from the world and found itself instead in a sea of the Feywild, that strange realm of faerie that touches the world in mystical places. For a century, it seemed Evermeet was lost to the world. Venerable elves tried to hold on, hoping that this echo of the first Sundering might echo Evermeet's connection to the world once the period of calamity ended.": "然后，法术瘟疫来袭，一些古老的精灵高级魔法肯定已经解体了。埃弗米特变得与世界脱节，并发现自己处于精灵世界的海洋中，那是一个奇怪的精灵领域，在神秘的地方与世界接触。一个世纪以来，Evermeet似乎已经迷失在这个世界上。可敬的精灵们试图坚持下去，希望在灾难期结束后，第一次毁灭的这个回声可以呼应埃弗米特与世界的联系。",
	"Their patience (who but an elf could have such patience?) was at last rewarded, when ships from Evermeet docked once more in Sword Coast ports.": "他们的耐心（除了精灵谁能有这样的耐心？）终于得到了回报，来自Evermeet的船只再次停靠在剑岸港口。",
	"Knowing all this and having just met a venerable elf who was preparing for the journey, how could I not take the opportunity to tag along? I felt a little bad about taking advantage of the elf's blindness and forcing him to leave behind some of his baggage, but it was the opportunity of a lifetime!": "知道了这一切，并且刚刚遇到了一个正在准备旅行的可敬的精灵，我怎么能不抓住机会跟上去呢？我觉得利用精灵的盲目性并强迫他留下一些行李有点不好，但这是一生中最重要的机会!",
	"I overheard it said by the captain of the ship that Evermeet now somehow straddles all three planes: our world, the Feywild, and Arvandor. It touches them all, but exists fully in none of them. To find it, you must follow a pattern of stars until the stars change and then follow new stars. (I swear by Garl's nugget that's what he said!) Those who stray from the path are lost. How I wish I could have asked the captain where the lost ships went! But I couldn't give myself away.": "我无意中听到船长说，Evermeet现在以某种方式跨越了所有三个平面：我们的世界、Feywild和Arvandor。它触及它们，但不完全存在于其中。要找到它，你必须遵循星星的模式，直到星星改变，然后再遵循新的星星。(我以加尔的金块发誓，他就是这么说的！）那些偏离道路的人就会迷失。我多么希望能问一下船长，那些迷失的船只去了哪里！但我不能把自己暴露出来。但我不能把自己暴露出来。",
	"I had brought some food with me, since I didn't know how long I'd have to remain hidden aboard the ship. At the start of the journey, I pricked my ears up at every creak of the boards and at each elven voice, but after a time, lulled by the rocking of the sea, I fell asleep. The journey after that has a dreamlike quality. I know I must have awoken, eaten, slept, and taken care of other necessities—at least my food was all eaten by journey's end—but I don't recall the specifics. I only know that at some point the ship stopped, and someone took the basket in which I was hidden and placed it on a sandy beach.": "我带了一些食物，因为我不知道我得在船上藏多久。旅程开始时，我对木板的每一声吱嘎和每个精灵的声音都竖起耳朵，但过了一段时间，在大海的摇晃下，我睡着了。此后的旅程有一种梦幻般的感觉。我知道我一定是醒了，吃了，睡了，并处理了其他必需品--至少我的食物在旅程结束时都吃完了，但我不记得具体细节。我只知道在某个时刻，船停了下来，有人把我藏在其中的篮子拿出来，放在一个沙滩上。",
	"I felt it before I saw it. With the barest glimmer of golden light through the basket weave all that I could see, Evermeet took my breath way. Coiled in the basket like a snake, with cramps in every limb, I was desperate not to give myself away, yet I could feel the magic of Evermeet seep through my body, soothing aching limbs and easing guilty conscience. When I could breathe again, I gasped. And that was how the elf discovered me.": "在我看到它之前，我已经感觉到了。在我所看到的篮子编织的最微弱的金光下，Evermeet让我喘不过气来。我像蛇一样盘在篮子里，四肢抽筋，我急切地不想暴露自己，但我能感觉到Evermeet的魔力渗入我的身体，舒缓了疼痛的四肢，缓解了内疚。当我能够再次呼吸时，我喘了口气。这就是精灵发现我的过程。",
	"The blind elf, whose beloved treasures I'd displaced to take my journey, pulled me from his basket, and when he did so, his eyes were clear as diamonds and just as hard. I thought for sure that I was dead, and on seeing my surroundings, I can say with all my heart that I didn't care. Had the elf killed me on the spot, my soul would have gone to Garl and demanded a ship so that I could sail right back to Evermeet. My dumb wonderment caused the elf to turn and look, and he too was enraptured.": "盲目的精灵，我流离失所的心爱宝物，把我从他的篮子里拉出来，当他这样做时，他的眼睛像钻石一样清晰，也一样坚硬。我肯定地认为我已经死了，在看到我周围的环境时，我可以由衷地说，我并不在乎。如果这个精灵当场杀了我，我的灵魂就会去找加尔，要求一艘船，这样我就可以直接驶回埃弗米特。我愚蠢的疑惑引起了精灵的注意，他也被迷住了。",
	"As to what we beheld, well, imagine a place of staggering natural beauty and impossible elven artifice, an alien realm as distant and beautiful as the stars, but as much a part of you as your own dreams—part heaven, part home.": "至于我们所看到的，好吧，想象一下一个有着惊人的自然美景和不可能的精灵技艺的地方，一个像星星一样遥远而美丽的异域，但又像你自己的梦想一样成为你的一部分--一部分是天堂，一部分是家园。",
	"I'd like to say we shared a moment there, the elf and I. Perhaps in recognition of that, he didn't kill me.": "我想说我们在那里共享了一个时刻，那个精灵和我。也许是为了承认这一点，他没有杀我。",
	"It was over all too soon. I was put back on the boat, returned to the world, and warned never to try anything so foolish again—on pain of death. And I don't think I will—at least not until I'm getting up there in years. Then I'll keep my eyes peeled for elves with cloudy eyes looking west!": "这一切都结束得太快了。我被送回了船上，回到了这个世界，并被警告永远不要再尝试如此愚蠢的事情，否则就会被杀死。我不认为我会这样做--至少在我年事渐高之前不会。然后，我将保持我的眼睛，看是否有精灵带着浑浊的眼睛向西看！\"。",
	"Now, see? Wouldn't you have liked to have been a gnome's boots and touched Evermeet, even for just a few beats of the heart?": "现在，看到了吗？难道你不希望成为地精的靴子，触摸到Evermeet，哪怕只是心脏的几下？",
	"I have wandered these lands for longer than you've been alive, caravan master. I say this not to somehow lord these years over you, but so that you understand that when I say your proposed \"short cut\" leads only to the bloody demise of yourself and your work hands, you will believe me, because I have seen others make the same assumption, and die the same deaths.": "我在这些土地上游荡的时间比你活着的时候还要长，商队主人。我这么说并不是要把这些年的经验凌驾于你之上，而是要让你明白，当我说你提议的 \"捷径 \"只会导致你自己和你的工人的血腥死亡时，你会相信我，因为我已经看到其他人做出同样的假设，并死于同样的死亡。",
	"Though there are myriad nations, kingdoms, and city-states scattered across the length and breadth of Faerûn, it would be a dangerous mistake to assume that all of the lands in and between those places are tamed. Travel a short way beyond most civilized places, and one finds oneself in the midst of wilderness haunted by creatures deadly and foul.": "虽然有无数的国家、王国和城邦散布在法鲁恩的广袤土地上，但如果认为这些地方的所有土地都被驯服，那将是一个危险的错误。在大多数文明地区之外的不远处，人们会发现自己身处被致命和肮脏的生物困扰的荒野之中。",
	"The information below is excerpted from Far from the Misty Hills, a treatise on far-flung places in the North, composed by one Aedyn Graymantle, a moon elf ranger who hails from Evereska. In her years of braving the wilds, Aedyn has acted as guide, caravan guard, bodyguard, and trailblazer.": "以下信息节选自《远离迷雾山庄》，这是一本关于北方遥远地方的论文，由一位来自Evereska的月精灵游侠Aedyn Graymantle撰写。在她多年的野外探险生涯中，艾丁担任过向导、商队护卫、保镖和开拓者的角色。",
	"Boareskyr Bridge stands on the Trade Way and is the only consistently safe crossing over the Winding Water for more than a hundred miles in either direction. This alone makes it remarkable, but there, in the midst of a wilderness with nothing to set it apart for greatness, a mortal man murdered Bhaal, the god of murder. This is no tall tale. Even a century after Bhaal's blood was shed there, the river's waters run black and foul for miles west of the bridge.": "Boareskyr桥矗立在贸易之路上，是蜿蜒的水面上唯一持续安全的渡口，其方向超过100英里。这本身就很了不起，但在那里，在没有任何东西可以让它与众不同的荒野中，一个凡人谋杀了谋杀之神巴哈。这并不是什么高大上的故事。即使在Bhaal的血在那里流了一个世纪之后，河水在桥西数英里的地方流淌着黑色和污浊。",
	"Adding to the location's sacred nature, Cyric, the man who killed Bhaal, was himself elevated to godhood. Although he proved to be a malign power, statues of both Cyric and Bhaal were erected on the ends of the bridge, the two gods facing each other (though it is said Cyric stabbed Bhaal in the back). About a century ago, fanatics of Mystra tore down the statues and flung their stones in the river, but fearing retribution for such sacrilege, the merchants who use the bridge pooled funds to have them rebuilt in grander style than before. Now each god stands atop his own decorated archway that serves as entrance to the bridge.": "杀死巴尔的人西里克自己也被提升为神，这更增加了该地点的神圣性。虽然他被证明是一种邪恶的力量，但Cyric和Bhaal的雕像都被竖立在桥的两端，两个神面对面（尽管据说Cyric在背后捅了Bhaal一刀）。大约一个世纪前，Mystra的狂热分子拆掉了这些雕像，并把石头扔进了河里，但由于担心这种亵渎行为会遭到报复，使用这座桥的商人们集资把它们重建得比以前更宏伟。现在，每个神都站在他自己装饰的拱门上，作为桥的入口。",
	"Boareskyr Bridge is named for a long-ago adventurer who built the original bridge and used it as the center of a small kingdom, which also bore his name, north and east of the Trade Way, though it lasted only a few decades before falling to threats from the Fields of the Dead. The bridge serves as a connection between the lands of the North and the Western Heartlands.": "Boareskyr桥是以一个很久以前的冒险家命名的，他建造了最初的桥，并把它作为一个小王国的中心，这个王国也以他的名字命名，在贸易之路北部和东部，虽然它只持续了几十年，但在死亡之域的威胁下倒下了。这座桥是北方土地和西部中心地带之间的连接。",
	"The enormous black granite bridge is wide enough that two wagons can pass one another going opposite directions, and its waist-high ramparts are thicker than some castle walls. On most days of the summer and even during seasons less suitable for travel, merchant caravans cross the bridge and pilgrims come to pay homage, all beneath the protective gaze of the paladins of Elturgard stationed at nearby Fort Tamal.": "这座巨大的黑色花岗岩桥足够宽，两辆马车可以相向而行，其齐腰高的城墙比一些城堡的城墙还要厚。在夏季的大多数日子里，甚至在不太适合旅行的季节里，商队都会穿过这座桥，朝圣者也会前来朝拜，所有这些都在驻扎在附近塔玛尔堡的埃尔图加德圣骑士们的保护下进行。",
	"For many years, a ruined keep on the southern bank dubbed Bridgefort served as the campground for caravans passing over the bridge. Whether going north or south, caravan masters could anticipate a safe rest within the grassy space enclosed by the ruined walls, sharing the duties of keeping watch with other travelers.": "多年来，南岸一个被称为 \"桥堡 \"的废墟堡垒，一直是经过大桥的商队的营地。无论是向北还是向南，商队的主人都可以在废墟围墙围成的草丛中安全地休息，并与其他旅行者分担守卫的职责。",
	"Then in the midst of a crisis of leadership in distant Elturel, one of the heirs apparent for the post of High Observer, a paladin named Tamal Thent, went missing with her entire retinue near the bridge. Although an investigation was undertaken, no sign of Tamal or any of the others was discovered. Thavus Kreeg, Tamal's rival for the post, was elevated to the post of High Observer soon after, and one of his first declarations was that Bridgefort be rebuilt and given a new name in honor of lost Tamal.": "然后，在遥远的Elturel的领导危机中，高级观察员职位的继承人之一，一位名叫Tamal Thent的圣骑士，和她的全部随从在桥附近失踪。虽然进行了调查，但没有发现塔玛尔或其他任何人的踪迹。塔玛尔的竞争对手塔沃斯-克雷格（Thavus Kreeg）在不久后被提升为高级观察员，他的第一份声明是重建桥堡，并给它一个新名字以纪念失踪的塔玛尔。",
	"A flurry of activity occurred around Boareskyr Bridge at that time, with the soldiers of Elturgard making frequent patrols of the road and surrounding lands while Fort Tamal was being constructed. Today things are fairly quiet at the bridge. The tradition of caravans camping at the bridge and pilgrims visiting it continues, but now people stay in a caravan ground around a small village that has grown up outside the fort.": "当时在博阿雷斯基尔桥周围发生了一系列的活动，在塔玛尔堡建造的时候，埃尔图加德的士兵频繁地在道路和周围的土地上进行巡逻。今天，桥上的情况相当平静。大篷车在桥上扎营和朝圣者参观的传统仍在继续，但现在人们住在堡垒外的一个小村庄周围的大篷车地里。",
	"Activity around the area is overseen by a curious mix of Companions of Elturgard. The Companions—all paladins of gods such as Tyr, Torm, Helm, and Amaunator—tend to be either young firebrands or grizzled veterans content to sit by a fire. Many of the veterans have been stationed at Fort Tamal since it was constructed, and they have families that live in the village outside its walls. Their more youthful counterparts come from all over Elturgard, but all seem to have been assigned to Fort Tamal after some act of insubordination. Perhaps it is hoped that time out on the frontier with their more experienced counterparts will cool some of the young Companions' zeal.": "该地区的活动是由艾尔图加德的同伴们奇怪的组合监督的。伙伴们--都是Tyr、Torm、Helm和Amaunator等神的圣骑士--要么是年轻的消防员，要么是满足于坐在火堆旁的灰白老兵。许多老兵在塔玛尔堡建成后就一直驻扎在这里，他们的家人都住在堡垒外的村庄里。他们中更年轻的人来自埃尔图加德各地，但似乎都是在某种不服从命令的行为后被分配到塔玛尔堡。也许人们希望与他们更有经验的同伴一起在边疆的时间能冷却一些年轻同伴的热情。",
	"Certainly some of the young Companions I've spoken with see their post as a punishment. Boareskyr Bridge is far from the rest of Elturgard, and the caravans that camp at Fort Tamal never seemed to need such a robust guard before. Even the relative nearness of Najara seems to provide little reason for so many of Elturgard's mightiest defenders to be squandered on such a trivial task. For their part, the elder Companions talk of fulfilling duties and following orders, but to me they seemed too content.": "当然，与我交谈过的一些年轻同伴把他们的岗位看作是一种惩罚。Boareskyr桥离Elturgard的其他地方很远，而在Tamal堡扎营的商队以前似乎从来不需要如此强大的守卫。即使是相对较近的纳贾拉，似乎也没有什么理由让这么多埃尔图加德最强大的守卫者浪费在这种琐碎的任务上。就他们而言，年长的同伴们谈论着履行职责和服从命令，但对我来说，他们似乎太满足了。",
	"A paladin should have drive. They have been granted the power of the gods for a reason, and surely that reason can't be to stand guard while merchants sleep. Then again, the High Observer is, by all reports, a wise and effective ruler. Perhaps he perceives threats at Boareskyr Bridge that I can't. Najara has been more active of late, despite its quiet exterior, I assure you. Dragonspear Castle to the north was once again the source of an infernal incursion. And maybe there is something sinister about this place where a god of murder died and a god of lies is honored.": "一个圣骑士应该有动力。他们被赋予诸神的力量是有原因的，而这个原因肯定不能是在商人们睡觉时站岗。话说回来，从所有的报告来看，高级观察员是一个明智而有效的统治者。也许他察觉到了我所不能察觉的博阿雷斯基尔桥的威胁。纳贾拉最近比较活跃，尽管它的外表很安静，我向你保证。北边的龙矛城堡再次成为了地狱入侵的源头。而在这个谋杀之神死去、谎言之神受到尊敬的地方，也许有一些阴险的东西。",
	"For my part, I sympathize with the young firebrands, and I counseled those to whom I spoke to look to the skies. In the time of Cyric's legendary battle with Bhaal, pegasi dwelt nearby. The magical creatures are said to favor those of pure heart and even allow themselves to be ridden by such folk when the cause is just. That favor might never be bestowed on the young paladins, but I'm sure the thought will provide them with some pleasant daydreams.": "就我而言，我同情这些年轻的火种，我劝告那些与我交谈的人要仰望天空。在赛里克与巴哈的传奇之战时，附近就住着佩加西。据说这种神奇的生物喜欢那些心地纯洁的人，甚至允许自己在正义的情况下被这种人骑着。这种恩惠可能永远不会赐予年轻的圣骑士，但我相信这种想法会给他们带来一些愉快的白日梦。",
	"The great keep never fails to take my breath away: it stands on a volcanic crag a hundred or so feet from the coastline, a flat-topped spur of rough stone out in the midst of the surging sea. Imagine, if you can, the top of this crag hemmed in entirely by a tall wall. This wall is interrupted by several towers all the way around, and it encloses a large space from which even more of these same towers rise. Those who have seen this vista from above have said that it looks like nothing so much as a cake decorated with too many candles. The mist of sea-spray fills the air nearest the western walls, and in winter, this moisture can cause treacherous build-ups of ice. Sometimes entire towers along the western edge of the keep have to be abandoned for the season, they become so overtaken by frost.": "这座大堡垒从来没有让我失望过：它矗立在离海岸线一百多英尺的火山峭壁上，是汹涌澎湃的大海中的一块平顶的粗糙石头。如果你能想象，这个峭壁的顶部完全被一堵高墙围住了。这堵墙被周围的几座塔打断了，它包围了一个很大的空间，甚至还有更多同样的塔从这里升起。那些从高处看到这个景象的人说，它看起来就像一个装饰了太多蜡烛的蛋糕。海水喷出的雾气弥漫在离西墙最近的空气中，在冬天，这种湿气会导致冰层的险峻堆积。有时，沿着堡垒西部边缘的整个塔楼不得不在这个季节被放弃，因为它们被霜冻所笼罩。",
	"From the center rises the largest and thickest tower of Candlekeep. If the other towers are well-wrought branches and blossoms, then this surely is the bole of the tree: strong, massive, and rising well above the perimeter structures. About the central keep a garden spirals in rising steps, and those lucky enough to enter the library proper do so by passing around and up through this green space to the keep's main door. However, most folk who visit Candlekeep see this structure only from the courtyard east of it, where the facilities for arriving scholars lie.": "从中央升起的是烛台镇最大、最厚的塔。如果说其他塔楼是精心雕琢的树枝和花朵，那么这肯定是树的主干：坚固、巨大，并且远远高于周边的结构。在中央守卫的周围，一个花园呈螺旋状上升，那些有幸进入图书馆的人，可以通过这个绿色的空间，绕道而上，到达守卫的正门。然而，大多数访问Candlekeep的人只是从它东边的院子里看到这个结构，那里是为到来的学者提供的设施。",
	"The only gate into Candlekeep stands at the end of the Way of the Lion, which is the only road that provides access to and from the outside world. The route extends from Beregost, leagues away, and winds a lonely path out on the peninsula where Candlekeep stands.": "进入烛台镇的唯一大门矗立在 \"狮子之路 \"的尽头，这是唯一一条可以进出外部世界的道路。这条路从贝雷戈斯特延伸到数里之外，在烛台镇所在的半岛上蜿蜒出一条孤独的道路。",
	"Candlekeep is the largest repository of lore and writings in all the Realms (although my scholarly kin in Evereska don't like being reminded of that). It was once the home of the great prophet Alaundo the Seer, and within its walls were written the Prophecies of Alaundo. Its vaults, it is said, contain hidden knowledge enough to make any person with the ability to discover and absorb it all powerful beyond compare. The problem with doing that, of course, is the same as with secrets in any other location: one must know that a secret exists before its details can be sussed out.": "烛台是所有王国中最大的传说和著作库（尽管我在埃弗里斯卡的学者亲属不喜欢被提醒这一点）。它曾经是伟大的预言家阿伦多的家，在它的墙壁上写着阿伦多的预言。据说，它的金库包含了隐藏的知识，足以使任何有能力发现和吸收这些知识的人变得强大无比。当然，这样做的问题与其他地方的秘密是一样的：人们必须知道一个秘密的存在，然后才能探知其细节。",
	"To that end, Candlekeep's vast library is something of a defense in and of itself: for every bit of hidden lore of potentially great power that lies within, there are thousands of inconsequential recipes, old songs, bits of history, journals of long-dead folk, and myriad other pieces of writing of no lasting importance save to the monks of this place, and the sages who come seeking such trifles.": "为此，烛台镇庞大的图书馆本身就是一种防御：每一个隐藏的具有潜在巨大力量的传说，都有成千上万的无关紧要的食谱、老歌、历史片段、早已死去的人的日记，以及无数其他的文字，除了对这里的僧侣和前来寻求这些琐事的圣人，没有持久的重要性。",
	"Of course, before this treasure trove can be plumbed, one must gain entry to its hallowed halls. The cloistered scholar-monks of Candlekeep, who are called the Avowed, guard this place and work tirelessly to ensure the library's protection and preservation. Though they are friendly enough in a workaday fashion, they are also suspicious of all visitors to the library.": "当然，在这个宝库被挖掘之前，人们必须进入其神圣的殿堂。烛台镇的隐修士，被称为 \"圣徒\"（Avowed），守护着这个地方，不知疲倦地工作以确保图书馆的保护和保存。虽然他们在工作上足够友好，但他们也对所有来图书馆的人充满了怀疑。",
	"I have assisted more than one visitor with entry into the library, so I know the process well. The price of admission is the donation of a work of writing not already in the possession of Candlekeep. Though the monks refer to this offering as the \"entrance-gift,\" it is a toll to be paid, and often a quite high one.": "我已经协助过不止一位访客进入图书馆，所以我很清楚这个过程。入馆的代价是捐献一本尚未被Candlekeep拥有的写作作品。虽然僧侣们把这种捐赠称为 \"入场礼物\"，但它是一种需要支付的费用，而且往往是相当高的费用。",
	"To most, this requirement might seem difficult or even impossible to fulfill. After all, how is the would-be visitor to know exactly what Candlekeep does and does not have in its labyrinthine stacks? To this end, most visitors come to Candlekeep with multiple books they suspect might meet with approval.": "对大多数人来说，这个要求似乎很难甚至不可能实现。毕竟，潜在的访客如何确切地知道Candlekeep在其迷宫般的书堆里有什么和没有什么？为此，大多数游客来到Candlekeep，带着他们怀疑可能会得到批准的多本书籍。",
	"Fortunately for some, the donation need not be utterly unique. Some tome or treatise the library doesn't have in its archives is preferable, but the monks are open to a few other possibilities: rare editions, books with a great deal of history tied to them, even tomes with insightful (or just interesting) notes scribbled in the margins have all been accepted, as have the journals of folk who are well traveled or highly learned.": "幸运的是，对一些人来说，捐赠不需要完全是独一无二的。一些图书馆档案中没有的小册子或论文是最好的，但僧侣们对其他一些可能性也持开放态度：稀有版本、与大量历史相关的书籍，甚至是在空白处潦草地写着深刻见解（或只是有趣）的书籍都被接受，还有那些旅行经验丰富或学识渊博的人的日记也是如此。",
	"Most of those who come as petitioners to the gates of Candlekeep already know the cost of entry; those who don't are told of it at the gates, and turned away kindly if they have no such gift. Heralds; priests of the gods Oghma, Gond, Deneir, and Milil; certain archmages; and others acknowledged as \"friends of Candlekeep\" are permitted to enter without making such a donation (though such folk often contribute to the library's vaults as a matter of course anyway).": "大多数作为请愿者来到烛龙镇大门的人已经知道进入的费用；那些不知道的人在门口被告知，如果他们没有这样的礼物，就会被亲切地拒绝。预言家；奥格玛、冈德、迪尼尔和米利尔诸神的牧师；某些大法师；以及其他被认为是 \"烛台之城的朋友 \"的人，可以在不进行此类捐赠的情况下进入图书馆（尽管这些人通常会理所当然地对图书馆的金库做出贡献）。",
	"The great double gates of Candlekeep are as three times the height of a human, and wrought of strange black metal that seems to repel lightning and to be immune to magical divinations, according to at least one wizard I've accompanied here. Both of these panels are emblazoned with the castle-and-flame sigil of Candlekeep in their upper reaches. One of the two gates stands open far enough to admit visitors during the day, with the other kept shut.": "烛台镇的巨大双门是人类身高的三倍，由奇怪的黑色金属锻造而成，据我在这里陪同过的至少一位巫师说，这种金属似乎能驱除闪电，对魔法占卜免疫。这两块板子的上部都印有烛台镇的城堡和火焰标志。两扇门中的一扇在白天开放，足以接纳游客，另一扇则保持关闭。",
	"Five purple-vestmented monks tend this entrance. One of them steps forward to greet those seeking admission, discussing with new arrivals their intentions and examining what gifts they have brought. As the first monk examines an offered gift, determining its title and provenance, a second gate guard performs a casting of the message spell. The Waterdhavian sage Waldrop tells me that the recipient of this spell is an Avowed in a room nearby with a massive tome that notes the books in Candlekeep's vaults. Apparently aided by magic of some kind, that tome-keeper determines if the library has the book being offered, and responds concerning whether the gift is accepted or not.": "五位身穿紫色袈裟的僧侣负责这个入口。其中一人上前迎接那些寻求进入的人，与新来的人讨论他们的意图并检查他们带来的礼物。当第一个僧侣检查所提供的礼物，确定其名称和出处时，第二个守门人执行了一个信息咒语。水行法师瓦尔德洛普告诉我，这个咒语的接收者是附近房间里的一位阿维德，他有一本巨大的巨著，记录了烛台镇金库中的书籍。显然，在某种魔法的帮助下，那个守墓人确定图书馆是否有所提供的书，并就礼物是否被接受作出回应。",
	"One of the priests of Deneir whom I regularly accompany to Candlekeep has mentioned truth-seeking magics being at work on this threshold. The doorguard's fellows watch closely for any trouble, and other monks peer from the high towers that flank the gates, ready to summon help or lend magical support in case of attack.": "我经常陪着去烛台镇的一位德内尔牧师曾提到，在这个门槛上有寻求真相的魔法在发挥作用。门卫的伙伴们密切注视着任何麻烦，其他僧侣则从大门两侧的高塔上窥视，准备在受到攻击时召唤帮助或提供魔法支持。",
	"Those who are admitted are referred to as \"seeker,\" but also addressed by name if the monk knows it, or by \"goodsir\" or \"goodlady\" otherwise. Once a visitor is admitted, the monks at the gate part ranks to allow the seeker inside to the Court of Air. Visitors are instructed to cross that area and stand before the Emerald Door, where another monk receives them, offers them food, bath, and sleeping quarters, and arranges for each to meet a monk who will help to plan and then supervise the seeker's visit to the library.": "被接纳的人被称为 \"寻求者\"，但如果僧侣知道名字，也会被称呼为 \"goodir \"或 \"goodlady\"。一旦来访者被接纳，门口的僧侣就会分开队伍，让来访者进入 \"空气之庭\"。来访者被要求穿过该区域并站在翡翠门前，另一名僧人在那里接待他们，为他们提供食物、洗澡和睡觉的地方，并安排他们与一名僧人见面，后者将帮助计划并监督来访者对图书馆的访问。",
	"The Court of Air is aptly named. This cobbled courtyard is empty, containing neither tree nor well. Its southern wall is the southern wall of Candlekeep itself, with a number of fieldstone-wrought buildings intended for visitors' use built along it. Nearest the western wall of the courtyard stand two buildings: the House of the Binder, a large temple of Oghma with plenty of space to allow his faithful to camp and socialize, and the Baths, a public facility that draws water from the natural spring beneath the keep.": "空气之庭的名字很恰当。这个用鹅卵石铺成的院子是空的，既没有树也没有井。它的南墙是烛台镇本身的南墙，沿墙建有一些供游客使用的田园石锻造的建筑。离院子西墙最近的地方矗立着两座建筑：捆扎者之家，这是奥格玛的一座大庙，有足够的空间让他的信徒们露营和社交；还有浴场，这是一个公共设施，从守卫下面的天然泉水中汲取水。",
	"On the other side of the baths is the Hearth, a great eating-place and social hall for seekers, which has shrines to Deneir, Gond, and Milil built into it. The Hearth connects to the House of Rest, a structure with four-bunk rooms where seekers are assigned quarters upon their acceptance. Finally, next to the House of Rest, and built up against the eastern wall of the courtyard, are the stables, where mounts are housed and provisioned for the length of a seeker's stay, and the granary.": "浴场的另一边是壁炉，这是一个为寻求者提供的伟大的饮食场所和社交大厅，里面建有迪尼尔、贡德和米利尔的神龛。炉灶连接到安息之家，这是一个有四个双层房间的结构，寻求者在被接受后会被分配到这里的宿舍。最后，在 \"休息之家 \"旁边，靠着院子的东墙，是马厩和粮仓，马厩里存放着坐骑，并为寻求者的逗留时间提供补给。",
	"The northern edge of the Court of Air is made up of a wall into which are set twelve towers. These are the towers within which visitors are allowed to study. The famous Emerald Door stands in the western wall.": "空中法庭的北边是由一堵墙组成的，墙上有12座塔。这些塔楼是允许游客在其中进行研究的。著名的翡翠门矗立在西墙。",
	"Here a Keeper of the Emerald Door stands at all times, assisted by a small group of under-monks who act as messengers and runners. It is the Keeper who officially welcomes newly arrived seekers, and makes arrangements for their stay. Only this door leads deeper into the inner ward; the other towers have entrances onto the Court of Air, but don't have points of egress into the inner ward and thus the rest of the library.": "翡翠门的守门人一直站在这里，由一小群作为信使和跑腿的下层僧侣协助。守门人正式欢迎新来的寻求者，并为他们的逗留作出安排。只有这扇门通往内院的深处；其他塔楼都有通往空气法庭的入口，但没有进入内院的出口，因此也没有进入图书馆的其他地方。",
	"These court-facing towers in the north wall, called the \"necessariums\" by the monks, are the main places in which visitors interact with the treasures of Candlekeep. They are honeycombed with reading rooms and small gathering chambers, where monks may bring individual tomes to seekers to be read, and where seekers may consult with monks on further materials to enable their research. Despite being adjacent to other towers and having bridges to more distant ones, the chambers that guests can reach in the necessariums don't allow access to the rest of the keep.": "这些面向法院的北墙塔楼，被僧侣们称为 \"必需品\"，是游客与烛台镇的宝藏互动的主要场所。它们由阅读室和小型集会室组成，僧侣们可以在这里将个别书籍带给寻访者阅读，寻访者也可以在这里向僧侣们咨询更多的材料，以便进行研究。尽管与其他塔楼相邻，并有桥梁通往更远的塔楼，但客人可以在必需品室中到达的房间并不允许进入城堡的其他区域。",
	"Unfortunately, the foregoing is the extent of the information I have about the interior of Candlekeep. My personal experience is limited (as is the case with most visitors) to the Court of Air. Though the stories fly fast and thick in the Hearth about what lies beyond the necessariums, it is almost all conjecture and hearsay, with a heavy dose of fable, you can wager safely.": "不幸的是，上述内容是我所掌握的关于烛台内部的信息。我的个人经验仅限于（和大多数游客一样）空气法庭。虽然炉膛里关于必需品之外的故事传得又快又密，但几乎都是猜测和道听途说，还有大量的寓言，你可以放心地打赌。",
	"From the Court of Air, one can see that the tall towers that rise up above the northern court wall are interconnected by covered walkways. Many of these are roofed, but not walled, and monks—some of them under quite prodigious burdens of books—scramble to and fro along them. The passages are sometimes interrupted by small spiral staircases that provide access to higher and lower levels, and some of the larger walkways slope gently from one floor in a given tower to the different level in another.": "从空中法庭可以看到，高大的塔楼耸立在北面的宫墙之上，由有顶的走道相互连接。其中许多都有屋顶，但没有围墙，僧侣们--其中有些人背着相当沉重的书本--在上面来回走动。这些通道有时会被小型的螺旋楼梯打断，这些楼梯可以通往更高和更低的楼层，一些较大的走道从某一塔楼的一个楼层缓缓地倾斜到另一个楼层。",
	"The only other fact I know about Candlekeep's interior is that it extends even beneath the level of the courtyards, with staircases in the cellars of certain of the towers that lead down into the very bedrock of the pillar upon which the keep is built. A monk once confided to me that these caverns store emergency supplies and provide access to great wells, all of which would enable the great fortification to survive entire seasons—if not years—of siege.": "我所知道的关于Candlekeep内部的唯一事实是，它甚至延伸到了庭院的水平之下，在某些塔楼的地窖里有楼梯，一直延伸到建造城堡的支柱的基岩中。一位僧侣曾向我透露，这些洞穴储存了紧急物资，并提供了通往大水井的通道，所有这些都能使这座伟大的防御工事在整个季节--如果不是几年--的围困中幸存下来。",
	"The monks of Candlekeep are all cloistered scholars. Most of them have no magical power to speak of (though many of them are trained to know about such things); a notable handful, though, are spellcasters—either clerics of gods that represent the pursuit of knowledge or wizards. Even warrior-monks and paladins have been known among the Avowed, though never many at once.": "烛台镇的僧侣们都是隐居的学者。他们中的大多数人都没有魔法力量可言（尽管他们中的许多人都接受过了解此类事物的训练）；不过，有少数人是施法者--要么是代表追求知识的神职人员，要么是巫师。在 \"神赐者 \"中甚至还出现了武僧和圣骑士，尽管他们从未同时出现过很多。",
	"The Avowed are the sworn servants of the great keep, each rigorously tested to weed out any deceit before being permitted to take the oaths of the order. The monks' first priority is the defense of the library's knowledge against those who would steal or destroy it, but also against natural effects that might do likewise, such as mold, wet, and decay. Many of the monks wield various kinds of magic items to aid in these endeavors, and Candlekeep's facilities include more than a few scriptoria to facilitate the copying of books becoming worn, binderies to repair the same, and even magical storage that preserve rare books from any further decay or damage.": "誓约者是大守卫的宣誓仆人，每个人都经过严格的测试，以剔除任何欺骗行为，然后才被允许宣誓。僧侣们的首要任务是保护图书馆的知识，防止那些偷窃或破坏它的人，同时也要防止可能发生的自然影响，如霉菌、潮湿和腐烂。许多僧侣挥舞着各种魔法物品来帮助这些努力，而烛台的设施包括一些方便复制磨损书籍的文稿室，修复书籍的装订室，甚至还有保存稀有书籍的魔法仓库，以防止进一步的腐烂或损坏。",
	"I've never made a detailed study of the Avowed, as it's never been terribly needful for me to do so, but from my time spent in Candlekeep's Court of Air, as well as my conversations with Waldrop, I've picked up a few things.": "我从来没有详细研究过 \"誓约者\"，因为我从来没有必要这样做，但从我在烛台镇空气法庭度过的时间，以及我与瓦尔德罗普的谈话中，我学到了一些东西。",
	"The rank-and-file of the Avowed are divided into acolytes, who are newcomers to the order, and scribes, who tend to the majority of the work in the keep. Acolytes provide labor, doing the cleaning, lifting, and general sweating that a place of such size requires, and work at their studies, hoping to prove themselves and be accepted into the ranks of the scribes. The scribes do most of the archival labor required of the Avowed, and often pitch in with hands-on efforts when a particularly large chore needs doing.": "阿维德教团的基层人员分为圣徒和文士，前者是新加入教团的人，后者则负责教团中的大部分工作。圣徒们提供劳动，做清洁、搬运和一般的汗水，这样的地方需要这样的规模，并努力学习，希望能证明自己，被文士的行列所接受。文士们做了大部分 \"神赐者 \"所需的档案工作，当有特别大的杂事需要做时，他们往往会亲力亲为。",
	"The master readers are the sages and elder monks who oversee the scribes and teach the acolytes. All are possessed of significant experience and dedicated to the great library, and it is from this group that individuals are chosen to fill in the upper ranks when positions open up.": "读书大师是监督抄写员和教导信徒的圣人和长老僧侣。所有这些人都拥有丰富的经验，并致力于伟大的图书馆，当职位空缺时，正是从这一群体中选择个人来填补上层职位。",
	"Above the master readers are other high-ranking posts, each with specialized duty, from the Gatewarden who tends to the security of the keep to the Guide who instructs and educates the Avowed. Of particular note is the Chanter, who is responsible for continuing the ongoing recitation of the prophecies of the great seer Alaundo, who once made his home here.": "在主读者之上还有其他高级职位，每个职位都有专门的职责，从负责守卫安全的门卫到指导和教育圣徒的向导。特别值得注意的是诵经者，他负责继续诵读伟大预言家阿伦多的预言，他曾经在这里安家。",
	"I remember the first time I came upon the Endless Chant. It starts at the edge of one's hearing (I was one of the first in the courtyard to sense it), and slowly grows closer and louder. As it does so, everything else falls silent around you. In short order, a procession of Avowed arrive on the scene, and the only sound anyone can perceive is their echoing, sonorous chant. The Chanter or one of his subordinates (called \"voices\") leads this procession, and each of the Avowed is expected to lend his voice to the procession occasionally.": "我记得我第一次遇到无尽的圣歌时。它从人的听觉边缘开始（我是院子里最早感觉到它的人之一），慢慢地越来越近，越来越响。当它这样做的时候，你周围的一切都变得安静了。不久之后，一队 \"阿维德 \"抵达现场，任何人都能感觉到的唯一声音是他们回荡的、铿锵有力的颂歌。诵经者或他的一个下属（称为 \"声音\"）领导这支队伍，每个 \"阿维德 \"都要偶尔为这支队伍献上自己的声音。",
	"It was through my friendship with Waldrop that I met one of the eight Great Readers, the council of elder Avowed who oversee the operation of Candlekeep. She was tall, and I remember thinking that she was one of the most erudite folk I'd ever spoken with. Each of the Great Readers is given an arena of responsibility within the Avowed, usually a topic of scholarly importance, and acknowledged and treated as the foremost expert in that field.": "正是通过与瓦尔德罗普的友谊，我认识了八位大阅读者中的一位，他们是负责监督烛台镇运作的长老阿维德人理事会。她很高大，我记得我认为她是我所接触过的最博学的人之一。每位大阅读者都在阿维德内部被赋予一个责任领域，通常是一个具有学术重要性的主题，并被承认为该领域最重要的专家。",
	"Finally, above them all are two others: the Keeper of Tomes and the First Reader. Where the First Reader's focus is maintaining the integrity of Candlekeep's scholarship, and ever expanding its literary resources and base of knowledge, the Keeper governs the great library. The Keeper's word is law, quite literally—each Keeper's edicts are recorded for the edification of future Keepers, and all are maintained as ongoing traditions until changed by the word of a future Keeper. Waldrop tells me that traditionally the Keeper and the First Reader are supposed to have an antagonistic relationship, one focused on the cloistered monks and the enlightened goals of the library and the other on the mundane aspects of scholarship and Candlekeep's interactions with the outside world.": "最后，在他们之上还有两个人：通书保管员和第一读者。第一读者的工作重点是维护烛龙镇学术的完整性，并不断扩大其文学资源和知识基础，而守护者则负责管理这个大图书馆。守护者的话就是法律，从字面上讲--每个守护者的命令都被记录下来，供未来的守护者参考，而且所有这些都作为持续的传统被保留下来，直到被未来的守护者的命令改变。沃德洛普告诉我，传统上，守护者和第一读者应该是一种对立的关系，一个专注于隐居的僧侣和图书馆的启蒙目标，另一个专注于学术的世俗方面以及烛台镇与外部世界的互动。",
	"Although these high-ranking monks keep most visitors at arm's length, it isn't unknown for them to deal with adventurers directly when they need such services. While these scholars rarely have much coin to pay for the services of a company of venturers, they do possess the precious currency of Candlekeep: knowledge. I know of many companies who have been shown lore concerning lost ruins, then asked to brave some dangerous place and return with prizes that can be found only in that location. If the treasure that might be found in such places isn't enough of a reward, some Avowed are empowered to offer inducements such as procedures for creating magic items and written copies of rare spells to sweeten the deal.": "虽然这些高级僧侣对大多数来访者保持距离，但当冒险者需要这种服务时，他们直接与冒险者打交道也不是没有。虽然这些学者很少有很多钱来支付冒险者公司的服务，但他们确实拥有烛台镇的珍贵货币：知识。我知道有许多公司被告知有关失落遗迹的传说，然后被要求去一些危险的地方冒险，并带着只有在那个地方才能找到的奖品回来。如果在这些地方可能发现的宝藏还不够奖励的话，一些神通者有能力提供诱因，比如制造魔法物品的程序和稀有法术的书面副本，以增加交易的甜头。",
	"Those who come to Candlekeep are permitted to remain for one tenday before departing, and must remain away for at least a full month before returning. During this tenday, they may ask to read specific tomes known to be in the possession of the library, or they may ask the monks to find them tomes concerning certain topics. These works are brought to the reading rooms in the towers that face the Court of Air. Guests are permitted to ascend into those towers and read (but not copy) the tomes there, always in the company of one of the monks.": "那些来到Candlekeep的人被允许在离开前停留一个工作日，并且必须在离开前至少停留一整个月。在这段时间里，他们可以要求阅读图书馆中已知的特定书籍，或者要求修士们为他们寻找有关某些主题的书籍。这些作品会被带到面向空气法庭的塔楼上的阅览室。客人们被允许进入这些塔楼，阅读（但不能复制）那里的书籍，并且总是在一位僧侣的陪同下。",
	"One of Candlekeep's main sources of income is the sale of books. Three kinds of such books exist: copies of tomes of nonmagical lore, copies of spellbooks and other magical formulae, and works of the Avowed.": "烛台镇的主要收入来源之一是出售书籍。这类书籍有三种：非魔法传说的副本，法术书和其他魔法公式的副本，以及神通者的作品。",
	"The copying and binding of a work of nonmagical lore in Candlekeep's library is generally performed at a cost of 100 gp or so (though quite large books are always more). This manufacture may take several weeks, particularly for large tomes, so it isn't uncommon for those who desire such a work to commission it in writing, along with advance payment, and then come to the gate to pick up the book, or pay an additional price to have it delivered.": "在Candlekeep的图书馆里，复制和装订一本非魔法传说的作品，一般要花费100gp左右（不过相当大的书总是要更多）。这项工作可能需要数周时间，尤其是大型书籍，所以那些希望得到这种作品的人以书面形式委托，并预付款项，然后到门口来取书，或支付额外的费用将其送到。",
	"In contrast, magical books of spells and formulae cost much, much more—a spellbook might be priced at thousands or even tens of thousands of gold pieces. Each simple spell or cantrip in such a tome costs 25 gp or so, with the more complex and powerful spells fetching 150 gp or more each.": "相比之下，魔法书中的咒语和公式的价格要高得多，一本咒语书的价格可能是几千甚至几万个金币。在这样一本巨著中，每个简单的咒语或咒文都要25金币左右，而更复杂和强大的咒语则要150金币或更多。",
	"Each year, the monks of Candlekeep release a small book stamped with the sigil of the keep, and credited to \"The Avowed of Candlekeep.\" These books are always focused on singular topics, and contain short essays, excerpts, and other writings germane to the topic. They are sold at Candlekeep and by representatives in large cities for between 50 gp and 100 gp per book, though some are often resold for a great deal more.": "每年，烛台寺的僧侣们都会发行一本小书，上面印有寺院的标志，并归属于 \"烛台寺的信徒\"。这些书总是专注于单一的主题，并包含短文、摘录和其他与主题相关的文章。这些书在Candlekeep和大城市的代表处出售，每本售价在50到100金币之间，不过有些书的转售价格往往更高。",
	"Candlekeep also buys books and even sponsors adventurers on expeditions to seek out lost sources of lore across the Realms. The exchange of coin in such undertakings is, of course, open to the usual sort of negotiation.": "烛龙镇也购买书籍，甚至赞助冒险者在整个王国寻找失落的传说来源。当然，在这些活动中，钱币的交换是可以通过一般的谈判进行的。",
	"I don't suppose you've heard of Darkhold. It's been many years since folk whispered the name of the place in fear. After all, the Zhentarim, the organization that gave Darkhold its evil reputation, are by all accounts no longer the cadre of thieves, assassins, and evil wizards they once were. And strangely enough, according to my source among the Zhentarim, that change in character can be traced right back to Darkhold. As it was told to me, it came about like this...": "我想你没有听说过Darkhold。民间已经有很多年没有在恐惧中低声谈论这个地方的名字了。毕竟，Zhentarim，这个给Darkhold带来邪恶声誉的组织，从各方面来看，已经不再是他们曾经的小偷、刺客和邪恶的巫师的队伍了。而奇怪的是，根据我在Zhentarim中的消息来源，这种性格的改变可以直接追溯到Darkhold。有人告诉我，它是这样来的......",
	"Zhentil Keep was burning. The Citadel of the Ravens lay in ruins. The leadership of the Zhentarim died, were captured by the Shadovar of returned Netheril, or were in flight. The vaunted Black Network was shredded. Cells of Zhentarim agents were cut loose, and without connections or direction, they dissolved or were crushed by rivals. The Zhentarim was no more.": "赞提尔堡正在燃烧。乌鸦堡垒成了一片废墟。真塔里姆的领导层死了，被返回尼瑟尔的沙多瓦俘虏了，或者在逃。夸耀的黑色网络被撕碎了。根塔林的特工小组被解散了，没有了联系和方向，他们要么解散，要么被对手击溃。镇塔林不再存在。",
	"Or so it seemed. There was one stronghold of the Zhents that had not fallen and whose leader never wavered in his dedication to the organization. Darkhold stands deep in the mountains of the Western Heartlands, and there the remnants of the Zhentarim quietly gathered. There they swore allegiance anew to the leader who promised to reforge the organization into something stronger than before.": "或者说，看起来是这样。有一个振特人的据点没有倒下，其领导人对组织的奉献从未动摇过。黑暗之城（Darkhold）矗立在西部中心地带的山脉深处，在那里，镇特人的残余势力悄然聚集。在那里，他们重新向领袖宣誓效忠，后者承诺将把组织重新锻造成比以前更强大的东西。",
	"The man to whom this new Zhentarim owed fealty was a dark knight known only as the Pereghost. The Pereghost had long led the armed forces of the Zhentarim at Darkhold, and his vision for the revival of the organization was along military lines. After a time of recruitment and training, the Zhentarim emerged from Darkhold not as conquerers or as bullying capitalists but as mercenaries willing to serve others instead of forcing them to serve.": "这个新的Zhentarim效忠的人是一个只被称为Pereghost的黑暗骑士。Pereghost长期以来一直领导着根塔林在Darkhold的武装力量，他对该组织的复兴的设想是沿着军事路线。经过一段时间的招募和训练，根塔林从Darkhold出现，不是作为征服者或欺负人的资本家，而是作为愿意为他人服务而不是强迫他们服务的雇佣兵。",
	"In the years that followed, the transformation served the Zhentarim well. They earned a reputation for sterling service, and their ranks swelled. Those who knew of Darkhold thought of it as the headquarters of this new version of the Zhentarim.": "在随后的岁月里，这种转变对Zhentarim起到了很好的作用。他们以出色的服务赢得了声誉，他们的队伍也在不断扩大。那些知道Darkhold的人认为它是这个新版Zhentarim的总部。",
	"Membership in the Zhentarim is difficult to assess, but my source told me they might have greater numbers now than before their organization's fall. New leadership for this larger group has led to a shift in focus. While still a source of capable mercenaries, the Zhentarim have diversified into mercantile pursuits. Zhent guards now ride alongside caravans of their own. And whereas a military organization served it well in the chaotic period after its fall, my source frequently described the Zhentarim as a \"family\" and leaders as \"my good friend.\"": "根塔林的成员很难评估，但我的消息来源告诉我，他们现在的人数可能比他们的组织倒台前更多。这个大型组织的新领导层已经导致了重点的转移。虽然仍然是有能力的雇佣兵的来源，但Zhentarim已经多元化地从事商业活动。赞特卫队现在与他们自己的商队并驾齐驱。虽然军事组织在其倒台后的混乱时期发挥了很好的作用，但我的消息来源经常将Zhentarim描述为一个 \"家庭\"，领导人是 \"我的好朋友\"。",
	"My source also spoke in awed tones of the Pereghost, as though that figure were still alive and a leader of Darkhold. The Pereghost is never seen without his full armor and a face-covering helm. If it isn't an elf behind the mask, then I suspect a series of humans might have masqueraded as the Pereghost during the past century.": "我的消息来源还以敬畏的语气谈到了Pereghost，仿佛这个人物还活着，是Darkhold的领袖。人们从来没有看到Pereghost不穿全副盔甲和戴着遮脸的头盔。如果面具后面不是精灵，那么我怀疑在过去的一个世纪里，可能有一系列的人类伪装成Pereghost。",
	"I was curious about my source's tale, and so when I had cause to be in the region, I made my way toward Darkhold. An enormous mountain peak called the Gray Watcher of the Morning looms behind Darkhold to the east, casting a great shadow over the keep from sunrise until nearly midday. Darkhold sits in a cleft in the side of the Gray Watcher, the highest point of permanent occupation in a relatively flat and defensible valley called Darkhold Vale.": "我对我的来源的故事很好奇，所以当我有理由来到这个地区时，我就向Darkhold走去。在Darkhold的东面，有一座被称为 \"灰色守望者 \"的巨大山峰，从日出到接近正午时分，都会给这座城堡带来巨大的阴影。达克霍德坐落在灰色守望者一侧的裂缝中，是一个相对平坦且可防御的山谷中永久占据的最高点，称为达克霍德谷。",
	"Darkhold Vale contains a small settlement of the same name, consisting mostly of shepherds who tend their flocks in the high meadows of the Sunset Mountains, and a few farmers who coax fine crops from the soils that cling to the vale's fields. The settlement's main source of prosperity is the black stone quarry at the southeastern edge of the vale; the heavy carts groaning with slabs of stone for sale and the large, muscled workhorses that pull them are common sights here. The common folk of Darkhold Vale tend to be surly and suspicious of outsiders, though they are careful to avoid offense.": "黑暗谷有一个同名的小定居点，主要由牧羊人组成，他们在落日山脉的高草甸上照料羊群，还有一些农民从谷地的土壤中哄骗优质作物。这个定居点的主要繁荣来源是谷地东南边缘的黑石采石场；沉重的马车载着待售的石板和拉车的大块肌肉发达的工作马，是这里常见的风景。黑暗谷的普通民众往往对外来者感到愤怒和怀疑，尽管他们很小心地避免冒犯。",
	"This settlement of about a hundred or so is utterly under the dominion of Darkhold and has seen some benefit from the situation: the vale folk see a great deal more traffic and trade than the little hamlet would ever expect otherwise. Until recently, all the caravans bound for Darkhold could seek sanctuary only in the shadow of the keep itself. Now the people of the vale have recently built both an inn, called the Wyvern's Rest, and a separate tavern, called the Rookery.": "这个约有一百人的定居点完全在Darkhold的统治之下，并从这种情况中看到了一些好处：谷地居民看到了大量的交通和贸易，这比小村庄所期望的还要多。直到最近，所有前往Darkhold的商队都只能在堡垒本身的阴影下寻求庇护。现在，谷地的人们最近建起了一家名为 \"Wyvern's Rest \"的旅店，以及一家名为 \"Rookery \"的独立酒馆。",
	"Some of the locals send to market bales of the thick, rich wool they shear from their sheep. Others make a living hawking the dandelion wine that Darkhold Vale has always produced, but only recently begun to sell abroad. The vale has a small militia, technically under the command of the Pereghost, but which answers to a local captain named Sulvarn.": "一些当地人将他们从羊身上剪下的厚厚的、丰富的羊毛一捆捆地送到市场。其他人则以兜售蒲公英酒为生，Darkhold谷地一直生产蒲公英酒，但最近才开始向国外销售。谷地有一支小规模的民兵，技术上由Pereghost指挥，但他们听命于当地一位名叫Sulvarn的队长。",
	"To those who've come into conflict with the Zhentarim, living in a place so firmly in their power seems unthinkable, but the reality is that life is sedate here. Certainly, the soldiers in the castle aren't to be trifled with, but they hardly ever engage in the acts of petty cruelty that one expects from warriors serving a local lord. Those who misunderstand the Zhentarim often do so because they imagine them to be cackling villains in the vein of the Zhents of yore. In reality, they are pragmatic, willing to do whatever necessary to achieve their ends. But they have no need to terrorize the folk of Darkhold Vale, for one simple reason: they already control them.": "对于那些与Zhentarim发生冲突的人来说，生活在一个如此牢固地掌握着他们的权力的地方似乎是不可想象的，但现实是，这里的生活是平静的。当然，城堡里的士兵也不是好惹的，但他们几乎没有像人们期望的那样，对服务于当地领主的战士采取小规模的残忍行为。那些误解Zhentarim的人往往是因为他们把他们想象成与过去的Zhents一样的咯咯笑的恶棍。实际上，他们很务实，愿意做任何必要的事情来达到他们的目的。但他们没有必要恐吓黑暗谷的居民，原因很简单：他们已经控制了他们。",
	"In years past, these folk lived in fear and suspicion, with a hearty helping of racial prejudice; my first visit to Darkhold nearly a century ago was occasion for me to hear some of the vilest epithets attached to my kind that I've ever heard—even worse than those that fall from the foul lips of orc raiders in the North. The attitudes of the vale folk have changed over the years, however, no doubt due in part to the orders of the Pereghost when he reengaged the Zhentarim with the wider world.": "在过去的岁月里，这些人生活在恐惧和怀疑之中，还有大量的种族偏见；近一个世纪前，我第一次来到Darkhold，就听到了一些我所听到的对我的同类的最卑鄙的辱骂--甚至比那些从北方兽人袭击者的肮脏的嘴里说出来的还要糟糕。然而，多年来谷地居民的态度已经发生了变化，这无疑部分归功于佩雷戈斯的命令，当时他让赞塔林人与更广阔的世界重新接触。",
	"When I first beheld the great black walls of Darkhold, I thought all the legends about it must be true. On my second visit, I thought I'd try to confirm my suspicions.": "当我第一次看到Darkhold的巨大黑墙时，我认为关于它的所有传说一定是真的。在我第二次访问时，我想我应该尝试证实我的猜想。",
	"According to legend, Darkhold's story began more then a millennium ago, when it was known as the Keep of the Far Hills. It was built as a summer capitol for the so-called \"giant empires.\" Situated in the Far Hills, the castle was in a position to dominate trade routes north out of the Iriaebor Valley. It could also dominate river trade down the Yellow Snake Gorge.": "根据传说，Darkhold的故事始于一千年前，当时它被称为 \"远山堡\"。它是作为所谓的 \"巨人帝国 \"的夏季首都而建造的。坐落在远山，城堡处于主导地位，向北离开伊里亚博尔山谷的贸易路线。它还可以主导黄蛇峡谷下游的河流贸易。",
	"The role of the so-called Giant Emperors is still a matter of conjecture and discussion today. However, there are some, scattered among the giant tribes of the North, who claim to be heirs to the ancient thrones. Whatever the truth of the empires might be, the castle itself was definitely built for giants. Its size and construction support no other explanation.": "所谓的巨人皇帝的作用，今天仍然是一个猜测和讨论的问题。然而，有一些人，散落在北方的巨人部落中，声称是古代王位的继承人。不管帝国的真相是什么，城堡本身肯定是为巨人而建的。它的规模和结构支持没有其他解释。",
	"Legend has it that Darkhold was lost to the giants due to internal strife—a pair of brothers quarreling over their inheritance. Through poison, magic, and mercenaries, the brothers thinned the castle's population until only the brothers themselves were left. The two fought and mortally wounded each other, and each dragged himself off to die alone. The brothers' spirits are still said to stalk the castle, each still seeking his brother's destruction.": "传说中，Darkhold是由于内部纷争而被巨人夺走的--一对兄弟为他们的继承权争吵不休。通过毒药、魔法和雇佣兵，这对兄弟减少了城堡里的人口，直到只剩下兄弟俩自己。两人互相争斗并造成了致命的伤害，各自拖着疲惫的身躯独自死去。据说兄弟俩的灵魂仍然在城堡里徘徊，每个人都在寻求他兄弟的毁灭。",
	"The keep was then occupied by a succession of owners, including a dragon of some repute, but it was not until a lich claimed it that the castle came to be known as Darkhold. The lich was called Varalla, and supposedly she conjured all manner of evil creatures to serve her, sending them out to dominate the lands beyond and establish an empire of evil. Varalla ruled Darkhold until the infamous leaders of the old Zhentarim—Manshoon and Fzoul—heard tales of her wealth in magic and gold. Lured by the promise of such rich rewards, the pair defeated her and claimed the castle for themselves.": "之后，这座城堡被一连串的主人占据，其中包括一条名声显赫的龙，但直到一个巫师宣称拥有它，这座城堡才被称为Darkhold。这个巫师叫瓦拉拉，据说她召唤了各种邪恶的生物来为她服务，派他们去统治外面的土地，建立一个邪恶的帝国。瓦拉拉统治着Darkhold，直到旧Zhentarim的臭名昭著的领导人--Manshoon和Fzoul--听到关于她的魔法和黄金财富的故事。在如此丰厚的回报的诱惑下，两人打败了她，将城堡据为己有。",
	"Upon my arrival at the great gates to the fortress, I found that I was expected, as I must have been watched since entering Darkhold Vale—perhaps even before then. After a short wait, I was met by a seneschal, a forthright woman with a strong handshake, who warmly referred to the person who secretly supplied me with the history of the Zhentarim. I found myself taken aback by this because I had thought my source and I had spoken in confidence. As you no doubt have noticed, I've avoided mentioning the name, gender, or physical description of my source, for I swore an oath of secrecy. Besides my initial shock, my exchange with the seneschal was pleasant, and I was given a tour of some of the mighty castle.": "当我到达要塞的大门前时，我发现有人在等我，因为我一定是在进入黑暗谷后就被盯上了--也许甚至是在那之前。在短暂的等待之后，一位元老接见了我，她是个直率的女人，握手有力，她热情地提到了那个秘密向我提供Zhentarim的历史的人。我发现自己对此大吃一惊，因为我原以为我的消息来源和我是秘密交谈的。毫无疑问，你已经注意到了，我一直避免提及我的消息来源的姓名、性别或身体描述，因为我发过誓要保密。除了最初的震惊之外，我和参谋长的交流很愉快，我被带着参观了一些强大的城堡。",
	"When I asked about the legends of Darkhold's creation and occupation, she told much the same story as I have told, adding a few characters from its history that I hadn't heard of before. When asked about castle hauntings, the seneschal only smiled in reply. Although it seemed a genuine smile, I could wring no truth from it.": "当我问起黑暗之城的创建和占领的传说时，她讲的故事和我讲的差不多，还补充了一些我以前没有听说过的历史人物。当被问及城堡闹鬼的问题时，参谋长只是微笑着回答。虽然那似乎是一个真诚的微笑，但我无法从中看出任何真相。",
	"Of the castle's defenses, I can say little. My tour was limited. But I did note that, while some things on the giants' scale have been modified to suit humans (such as stairs and most doors), other things remain titanic. For instance, I have no idea how they managed to open the gates for my entrance without the use of magic.": "关于城堡的防卫，我可以说得很少。我的参观是有限的。但我确实注意到，虽然巨人的一些东西已经被修改以适应人类（如楼梯和大多数门），但其他东西仍然是巨人的。例如，我不知道他们是如何在不使用魔法的情况下设法打开大门让我进入的。",
	"I didn't see the Pereghost during my visit, so I can't confirm anything about the man. But the seneschal and everyone else with whom I conversed spoke of the Pereghost in awed tones. Whatever the truth of this savior of the Zhentarim, he is apparently too busy to entertain curious visitors. While at Darkhold, I heard the name of another leader of some importance, Manxam, but my queries about this figure were redirected to other topics, and I didn't feel comfortable pressing the seneschal on the matter.": "在我访问期间，我没有看到Pereghost，所以我无法确认关于这个人的任何事情。但参议员和其他与我交谈的人都以敬畏的语气谈到了佩雷格斯特。不管这位赞塔林的救世主的真相如何，他显然太忙了，没有时间招待好奇的访客。在Darkhold的时候，我听到了另一个重要的领袖的名字，Manxam，但我对这个人物的询问被转到了其他话题上，我觉得不应该在这个问题上向参谋长发难。",
	"Of the rest of Darkhold I can relate only a little more. The Zhentarim maintain two war units within Darkhold: the Storm Watch, a cadre of veteran Zhentarim soldiers who act as heavy infantry, and the Gray Feathers, archers primarily responsible for the defense of the fortress.": "关于Darkhold的其他部分，我只能说得更多一点。镇塔林在Darkhold内有两支战争部队：风暴守卫，由镇塔林的老兵组成，充当重装步兵；灰羽，主要负责要塞的防御的弓箭手。",
	"These aren't the only forces Darkhold can bring to bear, however. The years when a contingent of giants lived in Darkhold are long gone, but in their place is an aerie of wyverns, bred and trained to defend Darkhold and to obey the Pereghost. Their trainer is a ranger named Grigarr, whose body is pocked with myriad scars from wyvern stings. The man is a greedy wretch who claims he is now immune to the wyverns' venom, after having been stung so many times. He loves telling stories in the Rookery about how he got his many stings, and thinks himself an entertaining storyteller because people listen and applaud. The truth is that the locals are terrified of him, so they humor him while he is in his cups.": "然而，这些并不是Darkhold能带来的唯一力量。当年住在Darkhold的巨人队伍早已不复存在，但取而代之的是一个由狼獾组成的小房间，它们被饲养和训练来保卫Darkhold和服从Pereghost。他们的训练师是一个叫Grigarr的游侠，他的身上有无数被狼獾刺伤的疤痕。这个人是个贪婪的小人，他声称自己在被蛰了很多次之后，现在对狼牙棒的毒液已经免疫了。他喜欢在Rookery讲他是如何被蜇的故事，并认为自己是一个有趣的说书人，因为人们会听并鼓掌。事实上，当地人都很害怕他，所以当他在杯子里的时候，他们都在幽默他。",
	"Ah Elturgard! If any place in the world exemplifies humanity's potential for greatness, it is this nascent nation. Who could forget the shining sight of a host of its Companions, paladins all, riding out on the field, banners taught and snapping, breastplates and shields agleam with the symbol of Elturgard, and each bearing a holy symbol of his or her god—armor for the soul. We have no shortage of the good and the just among my people, but the sheer zeal and genuine bravado the Companions have in pursuit of righteousness seems to me something uniquely human. And it's not just those few touched by the gods who seek these high ideals; Elturgard's armed forces swell with men and women who aspire to join the Companions. They are the Hellriders, so named because long ago warriors of Elturel literally rode through a gate into the Nine Hells to pursue and destroy devils that had been plaguing their people. With these bright examples to look up to, is it any wonder that the common people of Elturgard also tend to be devout in their pursuit of justice and worship of the gods?": "啊，埃尔图加德！如果说世界上有哪个地方体现了人类的伟大潜力，那就是这个新生的国家。如果说世界上有哪个地方体现了人类的伟大潜力，那就是这个新生的国家。谁能忘记一众同伴的光辉景象，他们都是圣骑士，在战场上驰骋，旗帜教人折服，胸甲和盾牌上闪烁着埃尔图加德的标志，每个人都带着他或她的神的神圣标志--灵魂的盔甲。我们的人民中不乏善良和正义的人，但同伴们对追求正义的纯粹热情和真正的勇敢在我看来是人类独有的东西。不仅仅是那些被众神感动的人在追求这些崇高的理想；艾尔图加德的军队中涌现出渴望加入同伴的男人和女人。他们是 \"地狱骑士\"，之所以被称为 \"地狱骑士\"，是因为很久以前，埃尔图尔的战士们真的骑着马进入九层地狱，追捕并消灭困扰他们的恶魔。有了这些光辉的榜样，埃尔图尔加德的普通人也倾向于虔诚地追求正义和崇拜诸神，这有什么奇怪的呢？",
	"Oh how bright Elturgard's light burns! If only it could last. Humans are, after all, short-lived creatures, and fickle in their faith and attentions. Elturgard is the product of just a generation or two of humans, and it seems implausible that it will last many more. Sadly, I think I shall witness Elturgard diminish. But it was a miracle that brought about the nation of Elturgard, and perhaps that divine provenance will preserve it.": "哦，埃尔图加德的光芒多么耀眼！只要它能持续下去。如果它能持续就好了。人类毕竟是短命的动物，在他们的信仰和注意力中是善变的。埃尔图加德只是人类一两代人的产物，它能持续很多年似乎是不可能的。可悲的是，我想我将见证Elturgard的消亡。但这是一个奇迹，它带来了艾尔图加德的国家，也许这种神圣的出处会保护它。",
	"It began, as all the great stories do, in darkness. Half a century ago, the city of Elturel was a petty power. It had claimed its neighbors' territory under various excuses, putting them under \"Elturel's Guard.\" Then, the city's leader, its High Rider, was revealed to be a vampire. The extent of the vampire's network of charmed servants, undead allies, and willing sycophants took the Hellriders by surprise. An undead plague swamped Elturel, and although its Hellriders made some gains by day, in darkness the vampire and its minions inflicted cruel losses. Each night the good people of Elturel prayed to the gods that dawn might come more swiftly.": "就像所有伟大的故事一样，它开始于黑暗之中。半个世纪前，Elturel城还是一个小国。它以各种借口要求得到邻国的领土，将它们置于 \"Elturel的守卫 \"之下。然后，这个城市的领袖，它的高级骑士，被发现是一个吸血鬼。吸血鬼的魅力仆人、亡灵盟友和心甘情愿的佞臣网络的程度让地狱骑士们大吃一惊。一场亡灵瘟疫席卷了Elturel，虽然地狱骑士们在白天取得了一些成果，但在黑暗中，吸血鬼和它的爪牙造成了残酷的损失。每晚，Elturel的好人们都向诸神祈祷，希望黎明能更快地到来。",
	"Then, on a particularly disastrous night when all seemed lost, dawn did come. A warm golden light suffused the city and surrounding lands, cast down from a golden orb that hung unwavering in the sky, so bright that it seemed a new day had dawned. Caught outside when this miracle appeared, the High Rider and his {@creature vampire spawn} burned away to dust, and the other undead quailed in its illumination. In short order, Elturel was free.": "然后，在一个特别灾难性的夜晚，当一切似乎都消失的时候，黎明真的来了。一道温暖的金光充斥着整个城市和周围的土地，它从一个金色的球体上投下，坚定不移地悬挂在天空中，如此明亮，似乎新的一天已经来临。当这一奇迹出现时，高阶骑士和他的{@creature vampire spawn}被抓在外面，烧成了灰烬，其他的亡灵也在它的照耀下颤抖。在很短的时间内，Elturel获得了自由。",
	"When the true dawn came, the new sun remained. And it stayed in the sky through the next night, and the night after, and each night from then until now. While some called it Amaunator's Gift, none could say what god granted them this boon. Most saw it as a companion to the sun and to themselves, and so it is known as the Companion. This holy wonder brought pilgrims of all kinds to Elturel. The devout, the curious, the afflicted—all came to bathe in its warmth and see its blessed light by night. Paladins had always been small in number among the Hellriders, but the Companion drew many to Elturgard, and the best among them was named High Observer to rule in the High Rider's place.": "当真正的黎明到来时，新的太阳仍然存在。它停留在天空中，直到第二天晚上，后天晚上，以及从那时到现在的每个晚上。虽然有些人称它为Amaunator的礼物，但没有人能够说清楚是哪位神明给予他们这种恩赐。大多数人认为它是太阳和他们自己的伴侣，所以它被称为伴侣。这个神圣的奇迹将各种朝圣者带到Elturel。虔诚的人、好奇的人、受苦的人--都来沐浴它的温暖，在夜晚看到它受祝福的光芒。在地狱骑士中，圣骑士的人数一直不多，但伴侣号吸引了许多人来到艾尔图尔加德，他们中最优秀的人被任命为高级观察员，代替高级骑士进行统治。",
	"To maintain order among the many faiths of the paladins, a special knighthood was created, named after the Companion sun. These paladins swore to uphold the Creed Resolute, an oath of service to Elturgard and all good people. And thus Elturgard now has both the Companions and the Hellriders.": "为了在众多信仰的圣骑士中维持秩序，创建了一个特殊的骑士团，以同伴的太阳命名。这些圣骑士宣誓维护坚决的信条，宣誓为埃尔图加德和所有善良的人服务。因此，埃尔图加德现在同时拥有同伴和地狱骑士。",
	"The post of High Observer is no longer occupied by a paladin, but by a priest of Torm named Thavus Kreeg, and this to me seems fitting. Paladins should be out in the world, using their divine gifts for the good of all, not signing documents behind some desk or dithering with dignitaries. High Observer Kreeg has ruled wisely and well these past forty years or so, but as a shortlived human, he is nearing the end of his years. When he passes or can no longer cope with the demands of his office, I hope that Elturgard can make a smooth transition to equally strong leadership. It is during such change and the struggles for power that result that humans often stray from the righteous path. Perhaps the light of the Companion will show them the way.": "高级观察员的职位不再由圣骑士担任，而是由一位名叫塔沃斯-克雷格的托尔姆牧师担任，对我来说这似乎很合适。圣骑士应该到外面的世界去，用他们的神圣天赋为所有人造福，而不是在某个桌子后面签署文件或与政要们犹豫不决。在过去的四十多年里，高级观察员克雷格的统治明智而出色，但作为一个短命的人类，他已经接近了生命的终点。当他去世或不能再应付他的职务要求时，我希望埃尔图加德能顺利过渡到同样强有力的领导。正是在这样的变化和由此产生的权力斗争中，人类常常偏离正义的道路。也许同伴的光芒会给他们指明方向。",
	"Sometimes called the Kingdom of Two Suns, Elturgard encompasses Elturel, Triel, Scornubel, Soubar, and Berdusk. It also claims and protects many small villages and farms strung along the roads and rivers in the Western Heartlands.": "埃尔图加德有时也被称为双太阳王国，它包括埃尔图勒、特里尔、斯科努贝尔、苏巴尔和伯杜斯克。它还宣称并保护着许多小村庄和农场，这些村庄和农场沿着西部中心地带的道路和河流串联。",
	"The heraldry of Elturgard—the sun and a smaller companion sun surrounded in a blaze—is familiar to many of us along the roads that lead to and through Elturgard, for it also blazons the armor and flags of its two groups of guardians, the Hellriders and the Companions.": "埃尔图加德的纹章--太阳和一个较小的伴生太阳被包围在一个旗帜中--是我们许多人在通往和通过埃尔图加德的道路上所熟悉的，因为它也标明了两组守护者--地狱骑士和同伴的盔甲和旗帜。",
	"It might be fairly said that the only reason Elturgard can exist as a nation is because of these knights, for it faces threats from all around. The wilderness to the south is home to ravenous monsters, and the serpent kingdom of Najara to the north routinely sends agents—both raiders and spies—to test the strength of Elturgard. The knights can't afford to be anything but vigilant, and fortunately for the folk of Elturgard, they are just that.": "可以说，埃尔图加德能够作为一个国家存在的唯一原因就是这些骑士，因为它面临着来自四周的威胁。南方的荒野是贪婪的怪物的家园，北方的纳贾拉蛇国经常派遣特工--包括袭击者和间谍--来测试Elturgard的实力。骑士们不能不保持警惕，幸运的是，对于Elturgard的居民来说，他们就是这样。",
	"I regard crossing the border into Elturgard as a relief, for it usually means the beginning of a safe haven, with a need to set fewer guards at night. Many adventurers find good cause to visit Elturgard, whether pursuing personal goals or seeking sanctuary from the dangers that surround the small nation. Additionally, the High Observer is known to employ groups of adventurers in matters of importance to the nation. Though it has many paladins and clerics in its ranks, outside assistance is essential to the continued defense of the realm.": "我把越过边界进入埃尔图加德视为一种解脱，因为这通常意味着安全避难所的开始，晚上需要设置更少的守卫。许多冒险家找到了访问Elturgard的好理由，无论是追求个人目标，还是寻求庇护，以避免小国周围的危险。此外，众所周知，高级观察员会在对国家有重要意义的事情上雇佣冒险者团体。虽然它的队伍中有许多圣骑士和牧师，但外部援助对于王国的持续防御是必不可少的。",
	"Several years ago, the entire complement of paladins at Fort Morninglord simply disappeared. The High Observer at the time ordered the fort, a day's ride west of Elturel, to be bricked up, and the curious forbidden entrance, for fear of what evil they might release into the world. The fort remains sealed today, and guards occupy a fortified encampment nearby. The camp serves as a base from which the paladins of Elturgard can patrol this area of the nation, and also as a deterrent to adventurers and other ne'er-dowells who might otherwise try to find whatever is trapped in the fort's depths.": "几年前，Morninglord堡垒的所有圣职者都消失了。当时的高级观察家下令将艾尔图勒以西一天路程的要塞用砖头封起来，禁止好奇的人进入，因为担心他们会向世界释放什么邪恶。堡垒至今仍被封存，守卫们在附近占据了一个坚固的营地。这个营地是艾尔图加德的圣骑士们在这个地区巡逻的基地，同时也是对冒险家和其他可能试图找到被困在堡垒深处的新人类的一种威慑。",
	"The second sun that sits directly above Elturel burns night and day. This orb is commonly called the Companion, but some ascribe it to one deity or another. Where the natural sun journeys across the sky and disappears at night, the Companion is steady and loyal, ever preventing creatures of darkness from assaulting the city.": "坐落在Elturel正上方的第二个太阳昼夜不停地燃烧。这个球体通常被称为 \"伴侣\"，但也有人将其归属于某个神灵。自然界的太阳在天空中游走，并在夜晚消失，而伴星则稳定而忠诚，不断阻止黑暗生物袭击城市。",
	"This second sun provides daytime illumination to the people of Elturel at all hours, and its illumination is as harmful to creatures vulnerable to sunlight as the sun is. This constant daylight lessens the farther one travels from Elturel, casting a sort of wan dawn light for fifty or so miles around the city. Beyond that, the orb is visible as a bright beacon in the sky. It can be seen clearly at night from as far away as Boareskyr Bridge and Berdusk, looking like an unmoving star low on the horizon. It might be fairly said that every land touched by its light is now under \"Elturel's Shield,\" but such claims raise hackles among Elturgard's neighbors.": "这第二个太阳在任何时候都为Elturel的人们提供白天的照明，它的照明对容易受到阳光照射的生物来说，就像太阳一样有害。这种持续的日光在离开Elturel越远的地方就越少，在城市周围五十多英里的范围内投下一种恹恹的黎明之光。除此之外，这个球体就像天空中的一个明亮的灯塔。在晚上，从遥远的Boareskyr桥和Berdusk都可以清楚地看到它，看起来就像地平线上一颗不动的星星。可以公平地说，被它的光芒触及的每块土地现在都在 \"Elturel的盾牌 \"之下，但这种说法在Elturgard的邻居中引起了不满。",
	"With no clear sign of the source of the Companion and so many faithful arriving in Elturgard each day, the first High Observer brought together a cadre of paladins and devised the Creed Resolute. This series of oaths and maxims outlines, among other things, that those who swear by it will not ascribe the Companion to any one god, nor allow religious differences to come between themselves and others. Those who swear the Creed Resolute also promise to serve the High Observer and uphold the laws of Elturgard, and always be in service to the greater good. While originally the Creed Resolute was intended to forge the fractious paladins of Elturgard into the Companions, the oath has since been taken by all among the Hellriders as well. If a Hellrider or Companion oversteps the bounds of the law or good conduct, often a fellow will say \"recall the Creed,\" and soon things are set right.": "由于没有同伴来源的明确迹象，而且每天都有这么多的信徒来到埃尔图加德，第一位高级观察员召集了一批圣骑士，制定了《坚定信条》。这一系列的誓言和格言概述了，除其他事项外，那些宣誓的人不会把同伴归于任何一个神，也不允许宗教差异出现在自己和他人之间。发誓坚决信条的人还承诺为高级观察家服务，维护埃尔图加德的法律，并始终为更大的利益服务。虽然最初坚决信条的目的是为了将埃尔图加德那些争吵不休的圣骑士们锻造成同伴，但后来地狱骑士中的所有人也都发了誓。如果一个地狱骑士或同伴超越了法律或良好行为的界限，往往会有同伴说 \"回顾信条\"，很快事情就会得到纠正。",
	"Though some of the Creed's agents seem unnecessarily stern, the people of Elturgard hold the Hellriders and Companions in the highest esteem. The Companions are without a doubt the champions of the people first and foremost, and the folk of Elturgard love them for it. Though it might be hard to get the Companions to crack a smile, I've found even the lowliest of the guards here willing, without a second thought, to lay down their lives in defense of their people, and the folk of Elturgard know it. Disrespect the Creed, and it isn't the Creed's wrath you face, but that of the local citizenry.": "虽然信条的一些代理人看起来不必要地严厉，但埃尔图加德的人们对地狱骑士和同伴们给予了最高的敬意。毫无疑问，同伴们首先是人民的拥护者，而艾尔图加德的人民也因此而爱戴他们。虽然要让同伴们笑一笑可能很困难，但我发现即使是这里最低级的守卫，也愿意毫不犹豫地牺牲自己的生命来保卫他们的人民，而埃尔图加德的人们也知道这一点。不尊重信条，你面对的不是信条的愤怒，而是当地公民的愤怒。",
	"Elturel is a city on a hill. It stands overlooking the River Chionthar, constantly illuminated by the Companion. A major location along the trade route through the Western Heartlands, Elturel and its environs for many miles around are a safe haven for visitors and citizens alike. Much of this safety comes from the efforts of the Hellriders, whose cavalry patrol the roads that lead into Elturgard, as well as the paths along the river.": "Elturel是一座山上的城市。它俯瞰着奇昂塔尔河，不断被同伴们照亮。作为贯穿西部心脏地带的贸易路线上的一个主要地点，Elturel及其周围数英里的范围内都是游客和市民的安全港。这种安全在很大程度上来自于地狱骑士的努力，他们的骑兵在通往埃尔图尔加德的道路上以及沿河的道路上巡逻。",
	"In the city's center, directly beneath the Companion, is a cliff-sided tor that holds aloft the High Hall. This castle, whose walls surround the summit of the mount, is home to the High Observer, and to a great deal of the bureaucracy of Elturgard. A stream runs out of the center of the castle, spawned by the powerful springs in its cellars. It flows north across the tor's top and then down one of its cliffs in a series of waterfalls called the Maidens' Leap. By canal it forms a moat for the eastern Dock District, before it joins the Chionthar. Along the stream across the tor lies the long, narrow garden, an open place of flowers, wooded paths, and arched bridges. The garden is a favorite meeting place for citizens of Elturel and retains a wild beauty in winter. The rich folk of the city dwell nearest the garden atop the tor, while folk in the town below live mostly in tall, narrow homes that are rich in balconies and windows.": "在城市的中心，在同伴的正下方，有一个悬崖边的托尔，它高举着高级大厅。这座城堡的城墙环绕着山顶，是高级观察员的家，也是埃尔图加德大量官僚机构的家。一条溪流从城堡的中心流出，由地窖里的强大泉水催生而成。它向北流过山顶，然后从悬崖上流下，形成一系列的瀑布，称为 \"少女之跃\"。通过运河，它形成了东部码头区的护城河，然后汇入基昂萨尔河。沿着穿越托尔的溪流，是一个狭长的花园，一个由鲜花、林间小路和拱桥组成的开放场所。这个花园是埃尔图勒市民最喜欢的聚会场所，在冬天还保持着一种野性的美。城里的富人住在离托尔顶上的花园最近的地方，而城下的居民大多住在高大狭窄的房子里，这些房子里有丰富的阳台和窗户。",
	"Its benefits notwithstanding, the constant illumination that bathes Elturel can be difficult for newcomers to adjust to. Inns and boarding halls usually swathe the windows of their guest rooms in thick cloth to block out the light so that visitors can get some sleep. Without the onset of dawn or dusk to frame the day's labors, citizens rely on the tolling of the bells from the High Hall to denote the start and end of the workday. The lack of natural darkness means the city sees less of the sorts of activities that city folk in other places often undertake at night. Elturel has a low incidence of brawling and ambushes in the alleys around its inns and taverns, and those who would engage in thievery must be especially careful and shrewd to succeed.": "尽管有这样的好处，但Elturel的持续照明对新来的人来说是难以适应的。旅店和旅馆通常会在客房的窗户上铺上厚厚的布，以遮挡光线，让游客能睡个好觉。由于没有黎明或黄昏的来临来框定一天的劳作，市民们只能依靠高堂的钟声来表示工作日的开始和结束。由于缺乏自然界的黑暗，这个城市较少出现其他地方的城市居民经常在夜间进行的各种活动。Elturel的旅馆和酒馆周围的小巷里很少发生斗殴和伏击事件，而那些从事偷窃的人必须特别小心和精明才能成功。",
	"A few other major settlements of note are located within the borders of Elturgard. I describe three of them briefly here.": "埃尔图加德的边界内还有几个值得注意的主要定居点。我在这里简单介绍一下其中的三个。",
	"A large population of artisans drives the activity in the city of Berdusk. Its native nobility, the so-called \"First Folk of Berdusk,\" have made a great show of their piety since the founding of Elturgard, and a great many of the high-ranking priests hail from their families. Over the years a few bad apples in their midst have given Berduskans a reputation for the sin of \"false piety\"—pretending to a stronger faith than one actually possesses. Though this attitude is disapproved of by the Creed, it has given rise in other parts of Elturgard to the expression \"as holy as a Berduskan priest\"—which is to say, not very.": "大量的工匠人口推动了贝尔杜斯克市的活动。它的本地贵族，即所谓的 \"伯杜斯克的第一民族\"，自埃尔图加德建立以来，一直在大肆展示他们的虔诚，许多高级牧师都来自他们的家族。多年来，他们中间的几个坏家伙让伯杜斯克人因 \"虚假的虔诚\"--假装比自己实际拥有的更强大的信仰--而声名狼藉。虽然这种态度不被信条所认可，但在埃尔图加德的其他地方，却出现了 \"像伯杜斯坎牧师一样神圣 \"的说法--也就是说，不是很神圣。",
	"Known far and wide as the City of Caravans, Scornubel is the great trading nexus of the Kingdom of Two Suns, and the Elturgard city I am most familiar with. Though responsible for a great deal of the nation's prosperity, it is also the source of plenty of its trouble; Scornubel is a haven for outlanders, many of whom are either troublemakers or folk whom trouble is pursuing. Add to this the machinations of Scornubel's native merchant-princes and the rumors of a thieves' guild somewhere in its walls, and it can be understood why the saying \"The High Observer's headache is named Scornubel\" has some merit.": "斯科努贝尔以商队之城而闻名于世，是双日王国的重要贸易枢纽，也是我最熟悉的埃尔图加德城市。虽然它对国家的繁荣负有很大的责任，但它也是大量麻烦的来源；斯科努贝尔是外乡人的天堂，其中许多人要么是麻烦制造者，要么是被麻烦追赶的人。再加上斯科努贝尔本地商贾的阴谋诡计，以及关于其城墙内某处的盗贼公会的传言，就可以理解为什么 \"高级观察家的头疼被命名为斯科努贝尔 \"的说法有一定的道理。",
	"Soubar is a small walled town with supporting farmsteads strung along the road to the north and south. It is a waypoint settlement much like any other except for the existence of the Black Abbey. This dark stone structure once served as a monastery to Bane and lay in ruins for many years. Now priests of Bane have begun rebuilding it, bringing an influx of wealth and trade, along with the many skilled masons and laborers necessary for such a project. Some people question the desirability of a temple to Bane in Elturgard, but those who do are encouraged to recall the Creed. For their part, the priests of Bane have pledged to aid in Soubar's defense against raiding goblinoids and other threats, a promise that gives some solace to the suspicious.": "苏巴尔是一个有围墙的小城镇，沿公路向南和向北都有配套的农庄。除了黑修道院的存在之外，它是一个与其他地方很相似的路标定居点。这座黑石结构曾经是贝恩的修道院，并在废墟上躺了很多年。现在，贝恩的牧师们已经开始重建它，带来了大量的财富和贸易，以及这种工程所需的许多熟练的石匠和工人。有些人质疑在埃尔图加德建立贝恩神庙的可取性，但那些质疑的人被鼓励回顾信条。就其本身而言，贝恩的祭司们已承诺协助苏巴尔防御突袭的哥布林诺人和其他威胁，这一承诺给可疑的人带来一些安慰。",
	"I would be remiss if I didn't mention Evereska, but I will be brief for I have no desire to publish all its secrets. I shall endeavor to describe my own homeland in as unbiased a way as I might, but I must warn: I am a daughter of the Greycloak Hills, and its mists yet roil through my soul as surely as elven blood does through my veins. Ere I make mention of my home, though, I will discuss the meeting-ground that is the closest most outsiders will ever get to fair Evereska: the Halfway Inn.": "如果我不提及埃弗里斯卡，那就是我的失职，但我将会很简短，因为我不想公布它的所有秘密。我将努力以尽可能不偏不倚的方式描述我自己的家乡，但我必须警告。我是灰袍山的女儿，它的迷雾还在我的灵魂中徘徊，就像精灵的血液在我的血管中流动一样肯定。不过，在我提到我的家之前，我将讨论一下大多数外人最接近公平的埃弗里斯卡的聚会场所：中途旅馆。",
	"Evereska lies hidden in the Greycloaks. Our paths to it are secret, cloaked by natural features and magical guise. No significant human settlement stands within a hundred miles west of it, and to the east lies the hungry desert sands of Anauroch.": "埃弗里斯卡隐藏在灰袍人中。我们通往它的道路是秘密的，被自然特征和魔法的伪装所掩盖。在它以西100英里内没有重要的人类定居点，东边是阿瑙罗克的饥饿沙漠沙地。",
	"Strange, then, that the Halfway Inn should stand where it does. Perhaps it is there because, as humans put it, \"It is halfway to everywhere.\" A small village surrounds the titular inn, which is itself not a single building, but a small compound that includes stables and other outbuildings. The folk who live here yearround are hunters, trappers, gold prospectors, gem seekers, smallholders and their families, and it is they who staff the inn when traders come to see what goods can be reaped from the region.": "那么，奇怪的是，半路客栈应该站在那里。也许它在那里是因为，正如人类所说的，\"它是通往各处的半路\"。一个小村庄围绕着这个有名的旅馆，它本身不是一个单独的建筑，而是一个包括马厩和其他附属建筑的小院。常年生活在这里的人是猎人、捕猎者、淘金者、宝石寻求者、小农和他们的家人，当商人们来看看这个地区可以收获什么货物时，他们就是旅馆的工作人员。",
	"Evereska is self-sufficient, but its citizens in their travels sometimes stop at the Halfway Inn and, if traders are present, exchange goods with them. Whenever I return home, I make it a point to spend at least a night at the inn to see old friends (often much older since last I saw them) and learn what has passed since my last visit.": "埃弗里斯卡是自给自足的，但其公民在旅行中有时会在半路客栈停留，如果有商人在，就会与他们交换货物。每当我回家时，我都会特意在客栈至少待上一晚，看看老朋友（往往比上次见面时老了很多），并了解自我上次访问以来的情况。",
	"Elf artisans sometimes come out of the Greycloak Hills to sell their goods here, and some of the bestknown can sometimes spark impromptu bidding wars over the right to purchase their wares. My kin don't do anything so pedestrian as set up booths or tables for themselves, but instead deal with a few traders who might be at the inn at the time. These agents then travel out and sell the elven crafts to others, which has given the Halfway Inn an undeserved reputation as Evereska's trading post.": "精灵工匠有时会从灰袍山出来，在这里出售他们的商品，而一些最有名的工匠有时会为了购买他们的商品而引发即兴的竞价大战。我的亲戚们不会为自己摆设摊位或桌子这样的小事，而是与当时可能在旅馆的几个商人打交道。这些代理人然后外出旅行，把精灵的工艺品卖给其他人，这使半路客栈获得了一个不应有的声誉，即Evereska的贸易站。",
	"Permit me to state this in as clear a fashion as writing allows: don't venture into the mountains seeking Evereska unless you are in the company of a citizen of Evereska. You will not find such accompaniment easily, for we are determined over the whole of our lives that no outsiders may gaze upon our homes without invitation from the eldest among us. If strangers need to meet with any of us, that is the purpose the Halfway Inn fulfills.": "请允许我以书面形式明确指出：除非你有埃弗里斯卡的公民陪伴，否则不要冒险进入山区寻找埃弗里斯卡。你不会轻易找到这样的同伴，因为我们一生都决定，没有我们中最年长者的邀请，外人不得窥视我们的家园。如果陌生人需要与我们中的任何一个人见面，这就是半路旅店所要达到的目的。",
	"When I rest at the end of the day and retreat into reverie, I do not revisit the wonders of ancient ruins and majestic creatures I have seen on my wanderings. At those times, I recall the Evereska I wandered as a youth, when I followed a haunting song or a wisp of light among the roiling fogs of the Greycloaks, picked sweet berries in the hollows of the hills, and swam in the cold streams that flowed out of their heights.": "当我在一天结束时休息，退回到遐想中时，我不会重温我在漫游中看到的古代遗迹和雄伟生物的奇迹。在那些时候，我回忆起我年轻时游荡的埃弗里斯卡，那时我在灰袍人的滚滚浓雾中追随一首萦绕的歌曲或一缕光亮，在山丘的空地上采摘甜美的浆果，在从山丘高处流出的寒冷溪流中游泳。",
	"Evereska nestles in a sunny canyon, high in the": "埃弗里斯卡依偎在一个阳光充足的峡谷中，高高在上。",
	"mountains. The surrounding peaks hide it from all but the most powerful fliers who can stand the chill and high winds of their towering heights. Yet should such approach Evereska, its guardians mounted on giant eagles would ensure no ill befell the vale.": "山脉。周围的山峰将它隐藏起来，除了最强大的飞行者，他们可以忍受其高耸的寒气和大风。然而，如果这样的人接近埃弗里斯卡，它的守护者骑着巨鹰将确保谷地不会受到任何伤害。",
	"Unlike cramped and crowded human cities, Evereska is composed of clusters of buildings throughout the many levels of the great valley, with many a footpath between them. These clusters are separated by clearings, meadows, and small woodland groves—natural spaces just as much a part of the city as the buildings are, their presence essential to our way of life.": "与狭窄和拥挤的人类城市不同，Evereska由建筑群组成，分布在大山谷的许多层面，在它们之间有许多人行道。这些建筑群被空地、草地和小树林隔开--自然空间和建筑一样是城市的一部分，它们的存在对我们的生活方式至关重要。",
	"With the recent tragedy of Myth Drannor's second fall, Evereska has seen the largest influx of new citizens in many centuries, in the form of our Cormanthan brethren. They have been warmly welcomed into Evereska, but some of our people are concerned that so many new residents will disrupt the peace and balance we've thus far been able to maintain. At the same time, some of the newcomers have reacted unpleasantly to Evereska's reclusiveness, which they see as a form of prejudice or cowardice, and a few of their younger folk have taken it upon themselves to speak on such topics rather heatedly. I'm hopeful that the coming decades will smooth over these differences and sooth the contentions. Evereska is a beautiful place, and I see no reason to mar that beauty with an argument among friends.": "随着最近神话Drannor第二次沦陷的悲剧，Evereska看到了许多世纪以来最大的新公民涌入，他们是我们的Cormanthan兄弟。他们受到了Evereska的热烈欢迎，但我们的一些人担心这么多新居民会破坏我们迄今为止所能维持的和平与平衡。同时，一些新来者对Evereska的隐蔽性做出了不愉快的反应，他们认为这是一种偏见或怯懦，有几个年轻的民工主动就这种话题发表了相当激烈的看法。我希望未来的几十年能抚平这些分歧，抚平争论。Evereska是一个美丽的地方，我认为没有理由用朋友之间的争论来破坏这种美丽。",
	"The expanse known as the Fields of the Dead has been the battleground for myriad wars and skirmishes over the centuries. It is said that the hills that dot the countryside here all hold the dead, and there is some measure of truth to that—many of the hillocks are indeed barrows, raised to house the fallen dead of one faction or nation on either side of a war. I have seen more than one such barrow, either broken open from the outside by those seeking lost treasures, or somehow broken from within.": "几个世纪以来，这片被称为 \"死亡之域 \"的广阔区域一直是无数战争和小规模冲突的战场。据说点缀在这里的乡村的山丘上都有死者，这话有一定的道理--许多山丘确实是荒冢，是为了安置战争中某一派别或国家的阵亡者而建造的。我见过不止一个这样的荒冢，要么是被那些寻找丢失的宝物的人从外面砸开，要么是不知何故从里面砸开。",
	"The Fields of the Dead is a vast, rolling plain of windswept grasses that seems to go on to the horizon in every direction. Regular travelers through the area speak of the \"whispers of the dead,\" the popular term for the sound that results when a breeze rustles the grass. The wind almost always blows here, and it isn't uncommon to smell salt in the air even dozens of leagues inland.": "亡灵之野是一片广阔的、由风吹草低见牛羊的平原，似乎一直延伸到地平线的各个方向。经常经过该地区的旅行者都会提到 \"死者的耳语\"，这是一个流行的术语，指的是微风吹动草地时产生的声音。这里的风几乎总是在吹，即使在内陆几十里格的地方也能闻到空气中的盐味，这并不罕见。",
	"Though this land is uncivilized, it isn't barren. Even if many monsters hide in the tall grass or build burrows in the sides of the hills, the fields represent an opportunity for shepherds and free folk to claim a plot that no one else has yet occupied. Small, stout farmhouses and even a few walled enclosures that contain several such dwellings can occasionally be found a short distance away from the roads and rivers that run through or near the Fields.": "虽然这片土地未被开化，但它并不荒芜。即使许多怪物躲在高高的草丛中，或在山丘的两侧筑起洞穴，田地也代表着牧羊人和自由民的机会，他们可以拥有一块别人尚未占领的土地。在穿过田野或靠近田野的道路和河流的不远处，偶尔可以发现小型的、坚固的农舍，甚至是一些包含几个这样的住所的围墙。",
	"The folk of this land are kind but wary, usually willing to share their wells or cisterns, and part with the goods they store away in return for goods in trade. I have met a few who show greater hospitality, letting strangers make camp within the shelter of the low stone walls that surround their steadings. They are a good and honest people, by and large.": "这片土地上的人们很善良，但也很警惕，通常愿意分享他们的水井或蓄水池，并拿出他们储存的货物来换取交易的货物。我见过一些人表现出更大的好客，让陌生人在环绕他们住所的低矮石墙的庇护下扎营。总的来说，他们是一个善良、诚实的民族。",
	"Away from the vicinity of these settlements, there are threats aplenty. Small bands of nomadic humanoids traverse these grasslands, as do monsters from out of the Wood of Sharp Teeth to the south, the Trollclaws to the north, or the serpent kingdom of Najara to the east. Occasionally, one of the barrows bulges and vomits forth undead, wakened by some instinct known only to them, or a patch of terrain buckles and collapses in on itself, revealing a sinkhole to warrens beneath.": "在这些定居点附近，有大量的威胁。一小群游牧的人类穿越这些草原，还有来自南边的尖牙之林、北边的巨魔之爪或东边的纳贾拉蛇国的怪物们。偶尔，其中一个荒冢会鼓起并吐出亡灵，被一些只有他们自己知道的本能所唤醒，或者是一块地形倒塌，露出一个天坑，通往下面的墓穴。",
	"Though the structure is crumbled and perpetually shrouded in mist, more than one of the caravans I've guided through these lands have seen Dragonspear Castle from afar and expressed a desire to seek shelter there. As I tell them at such times, it is better to seek shelter inside an opened tomb in these lands, and crawl in to huddle among the warrior dead within, than to seek anything like sanctuary from Dragonspear.": "虽然这座建筑已经坍塌，并永远笼罩在迷雾中，但我引导的商队中不止一个人从远处看到了龙矛城堡，并表示希望在那里寻求庇护。正如我在这种时候告诉他们的那样，在这些土地上，最好是在一个被打开的坟墓里寻求庇护，爬进去蜷缩在里面的战士的尸体中，而不是在龙矛城堡里寻求任何类似的庇护。",
	"Built by an adventurer named Daeros after he found a wealth of gems in a sunken dwarven settlement, Dragonspear Castle was erected above the very caverns where that settlement—fallen Kanaglym—was interred. Two hundred years ago, sorcerous machinations brought about the fall of Daeros and the opening of an infernal portal in the depths of the castle.": "一个名叫Daeros的冒险家在一个沉没的矮人定居点发现了大量的宝石后建造了龙矛城堡，它就建在那个定居点--堕落的Kanaglym--被埋葬的岩洞之上。两百年前，巫师的阴谋导致了达罗斯的陨落，并在城堡的深处打开了一个地狱之门。",
	"After that event, Dragonspear's ruins were occupied by hobgoblins and myriad bands of bandits, until Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate sent troops to root them out. Discovering that the portal yet existed, but unable to destroy it, they established the Hold of Battle Lions, a fortified temple of Tempus, in an attempt to prevent anything from coming through. In time, though, devils broke through new portals inside the castle's walls and overran the defenders.": "那次事件之后，龙矛的废墟被霍布林和无数的强盗团伙占领，直到沃特迪普和博德之门派兵把他们赶走。他们发现传送门仍然存在，但无法摧毁它，于是建立了战狮之城，一个坚固的Tempus神庙，试图阻止任何东西通过。不过，随着时间的推移，魔鬼们突破了城堡城墙内的新门户，并占领了守军。",
	"Then came the Second Dragonspear War, more than a century ago, during which a strange cloak of mist settled over the castle, and the forces of Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate once more attacked. This time, they defeated the devils, leaving the castle ruined and still cloaked in mists. At least one other time since then, the devils have punched back through, amassing other fell creatures to attack the nearby settlements (notably Daggerford), but they have been fought off by adventurers each time. The most recent stories tell of heroes confronting Red Wizards of Thay and other devilry. I pray that this will be the last time such efforts are necessary, but somehow, I think not.": "然后，在一个多世纪前的第二次龙矛战争中，城堡上空笼罩着一层奇怪的迷雾，沃特德普和博德之门的军队再次发动进攻。这一次，他们打败了恶魔，留下了城堡的废墟，并且仍然笼罩在迷雾中。从那时起，至少还有一次，魔鬼们又打了回来，聚集了其他堕落的生物来攻击附近的定居点（特别是达格福德），但每次都被冒险家们击退了。最近的故事讲述了英雄们与泰伊的红袍巫师和其他魔鬼的对抗。我祈祷这将是最后一次需要这样的努力，但不知为何，我想不会。",
	"Today, Dragonspear remains crumbled and mistshrouded. Rumors say that the castle—seemingly quiescent—has become home to undead horrors of some sort, but no one seems terribly inclined to investigate such claims, so long as they don't threaten the folk who live nearby. Some interested parties out of Baldur's Gate offered me more than a fair amount of coin to investigate the truth of these rumors, though I demurred. I don't fancy myself an investigator or a spy, and I know better than to seek out whatever foulness might have taken hold in this place.": "今天，Dragonspear仍然摇摇欲坠，被迷雾笼罩。有传言说，这座看似平静的城堡已经成为某种亡灵恐怖的家园，但似乎没有人愿意去调查这种说法，只要他们不威胁到住在附近的人。博德之门的一些感兴趣的人给我提供了超过相当数量的硬币，让我调查这些传言的真相，尽管我不同意。我不认为自己是调查员或间谍，而且我知道最好不要去寻找这个地方可能存在的污秽。",
	"A tangled landscape of rough hills along the northern edge of the Fields of the Dead, the Trollclaws are home to a great many of the regenerating, bloodthirsty beasts. Exactly what makes these hills such prime ground for trolls is unknown (and a favorite topic of conversation around many of the campfires I've sat at while passing through or near this place), but there's no doubt that they dwell here in great numbers.": "沿着死亡之域的北部边缘，巨魔之爪是一片由粗糙山丘组成的纠结景观，是许多再生的、嗜血的野兽的家园。究竟是什么让这些山丘成为巨魔的首选之地，我们不得而知（这也是我在经过这里或在这里附近时，坐在许多篝火旁最喜欢谈论的话题），但毫无疑问，它们在这里居住的数量很多。",
	"Those traveling south to Baldur's Gate or north out of the Fields of the Dead typically travel through the Trollclaws. The Trollclaw Ford, so named for obvious reasons, is the only place for leagues that wagons can safely cross the Winding Water. Important as it is, the site has been occupied by several forces over the years, as evidenced by the ruined remnants of forts and similar buildings nearby. But those claimants have always fallen eventually to prolonged assaults by trolls. My advice is to avoid the region entirely, but if you can't, keep a lit torch handy at all times.": "那些南下前往博德之门或北上离开死亡之域的人通常都要经过巨魔之爪。巨魔堡垒（Trollclaw Ford）因明显的原因而得名，是联盟中唯一可以让马车安全穿越蜿蜒水域的地方。这个地方虽然重要，但多年来一直被几股势力占领，附近的堡垒和类似建筑的废墟就是证明。但这些要求者最终总是倒在巨魔的长期攻击之下。我的建议是完全避开这个地区，但如果你不能这样做，请随时保持一个点燃的火把。",
	"I have been to Hartsvale only once, and found it surpassingly beautiful each time. Its wonders are wild and untamed, with even the so-called civilization of the place exuding a kind of primal beauty that is found nowhere else that I know of.": "我只去过一次哈茨维尔，每次都觉得它美得令人惊讶。它的奇观是野性的、桀骜不驯的，即使是所谓的文明之地，也散发着一种原始的美，据我所知，在其他地方是找不到的。",
	"Hartsvale is far in the windswept north, a fertile mountain valley where the Ice Spire Mountains abut the High Ice. The Clear Whirl River, easily the cleanest and coldest I have ever bathed in, flows south into the valley out of the lands of the Endless Blizzard, feeding the rich soil tucked between the northern and southern arms of the Ice Spires. The river splits as it runs through the hilly lands, eventually draining into a series of lakes along the southern edge of the vale. Two small woods also grow in the vale, one along its northern edge, between the vale proper and the northern Ice Spires, and another fed by the lakes on its southern edge.": "哈兹韦尔远在风雪交加的北方，是一个肥沃的山间谷地，冰尖山与高冰层相邻。清澈的旋涡河，是我所沐浴过的最干净、最寒冷的河水，从无尽暴风雪的土地上向南流入山谷，为夹在冰尖山南北两臂之间的肥沃土壤提供水源。河流在穿过丘陵地带时分叉，最终流入谷地南部边缘的一系列湖泊中。谷地里还生长着两片小树林，一片沿着谷地的北部边缘，在谷地本身和北部冰峰之间，另一片由谷地南部边缘的湖泊提供水源。",
	"Originally the home of giant clans and ragtag barbarian tribespeople related to the Uthgardt, Hartsvale was conquered by the hero Hartkiller. He was a giant who had ventured into the lands to the south and learned of their ways. When he came to Hartsvale, he rallied the human tribes, uniting them into a fighting force capable of defeating the giants who tyrannized them, and they threw the giants down, claiming the vale between the mountains for their descendants.": "Hartsvale最初是巨人部落和与Uthgardt有关的破烂野蛮人部落的家园，被英雄Hartkiller征服了。他是一个巨人，曾冒险进入南方的土地，并了解了他们的方式。当他来到哈茨谷时，他召集了人类部落，将他们团结成一支能够打败暴虐他们的巨人的战斗力量，他们将巨人扔了下去，为他们的后裔夺取了山间的谷地。",
	"Giants aplenty still dwell in Hartsvale's mountains and forested hills, but they've reached an accord with the humans of the vale. So far as I know, they live peaceably distant from the human lands, and taboos exist among both humans and giants that keep them separate. In my time in Hartsvale, I saw no giants, but surely I saw their works. At the boundaries of lands where humans (and other folk smaller than giants) may not go stand titanic menhirs, likely erected by stone giants.": "大量的巨人仍然居住在哈兹维尔的山脉和森林山丘中，但他们已经与谷地的人类达成了协议。据我所知，他们和平地生活在远离人类土地的地方，而且人类和巨人之间都有禁忌，使他们保持分离。我在哈茨谷的时候，没有看到巨人，但我肯定看到了他们的作品。在人类（和其他比巨人小的人）不能去的地方的边界，矗立着巨大的石碑，可能是由石巨人竖立起来的。",
	"The folk of Hartsvale are ruled by House Hartwick, a line of royals supposedly descended from Hartkiller. Though human, House Hartwick's scions are all very tall and strong, most standing seven feet in height. The king of Hartsvale sits on the Alabaster Throne in Castle Hartwick, and the many earls of the vale's duchies owe their fealty to him.": "哈兹维尔的居民由哈特威克家族统治，这是一个据说是哈特基勒的后裔的王族。虽然是人类，但哈特威克家族的子孙都非常高大强壮，大多数人身高都在7英尺以上。哈兹维尔的国王坐在哈特威克城堡的白玉石王座上，谷地的许多公国的伯爵们都向他效忠。",
	"Peace has reigned for many years in Hartsvale. Grauman, called the Good King by his people, sits the Alabaster Throne, though his years are advanced. His eldest son and heir, Taumarik, is a young ranger who has recently returned from a three-year journey to explore the North. He came back with a wife, the sorceress Ylienna of Silverymoon, and has begun to take on more of his father's onerous responsibilities. There is some strife in the court, however, for the earls don't seem to trust his \"out-vale witch-bride\" (a phrase that infuriates Taumarik, but seems to gently amuse Ylienna). For myself, I found the lady Ylienna a delight on the one occasion when I was in her company.": "哈茨维尔的和平已经统治了很多年。格鲁曼，被他的人民称为好国王，坐在青石板王座上，尽管他年事已高。他的长子和继承人陶马利克是一个年轻的游侠，最近刚从探索北方的三年旅程中回来。他带着妻子--银月城的女巫伊莲娜回来，并开始承担他父亲的更多繁重的责任。然而，宫廷里有一些纷争，因为伯爵们似乎并不信任他的 \"出谷女巫-新娘\"（这句话激怒了陶玛里克，但似乎轻轻地逗笑了伊莲娜）。就我自己而言，我发现伊莲娜女士在我和她在一起的时候是很愉快的。",
	"The vale is well guarded, as all jewels should be—in this case by the perils of the mountains and giantsteads that surround it. Nonetheless, a certain strong breed of merchant travels the narrow mountain passes leading into Hartsvale. The dwarves of Citadel Adbar jestingly refer to these people as \"goats of coin,\" for they will cling like such animals to the most precarious of mountain ridges while seeking the opportunities that wait beyond. My own journeys with the goats of coin have impressed upon me the skill of these folk, who brave crumbling paths, avalanche-ridden passes, terrible howling blizzards, and monsters of all sorts to reach Hartsvale and get safely out of the vale again.": "谷地得到了很好的保护，就像所有的珠宝一样--在这种情况下，它被周围的山脉和巨石的危险所保护。尽管如此，还是有一些强壮的商人在通往哈茨谷的狭窄山路上穿行。阿德巴城堡的矮人开玩笑地把这些人称为 \"钱币的山羊\"，因为他们会像这样的动物一样依附在最危险的山脊上，同时寻找山脊外的机会。我和硬币山羊的旅行让我对这些人的技能印象深刻，他们冒着摇摇欲坠的道路、雪崩横行的通道、可怕的暴风雪和各种怪物，到达哈茨谷并再次安全离开山谷。",
	"It isn't merely the high mountains around the vale that hold dangers. Though the valley has scattered settlements, all of Hartsvale can hardly be considered civilized. In my time traveling these lands (with one of the few goats of coin that refused to be daunted by the fens around Castle Hartwick), I've found these lands to be still frontier-like, similar to some of the wilder portions of the North, particularly in the days before the founding of Luruar and the resettlement of Mithral Hall. Fell beasts aplenty make their lairs in out-of-theway places across the valley, and raiding bands of ogres often come down out of the mountains.": "不仅仅是谷地周围的高山有危险。虽然山谷里有零星的定居点，但整个哈兹维尔很难说是文明的。在我旅行这些土地的过程中（带着少数拒绝被哈特威克城堡周围的沼泽吓倒的钱币山羊之一），我发现这些土地仍然像边疆一样，类似于北方的一些野生部分，特别是在卢鲁尔建立和米特拉尔厅重新安置之前的日子。大量坠落的野兽在山谷中偏僻的地方筑起巢穴，食人魔的突击队经常从山上下来。",
	"Between two branches of the Clear Whirl River lies a great island on which Hartkiller built his castle. Stagwick, on the east bank of the river, is a small community of folk who work as farmers, fishers, herders, and artisans. These folk do a brisk business, as most outland merchants choose not to journey beyond Stagwick and instead sell their wares to the Hartsvale merchants. Perhaps a third of the merchants who journey to Hartsvale choose to undertake the trip out to the fiefdoms of the earls, who pay more to encourage this behavior.": "在清漩河的两个分支之间有一个巨大的岛屿，哈特基勒在上面建造了他的城堡。在河的东岸，斯塔克维克是一个由农民、渔民、牧民和工匠组成的小社区。这些人的生意很红火，因为大多数外地商人选择不离开斯塔威克，而是把他们的商品卖给哈茨维尔的商人。也许有三分之一前往哈兹维尔的商人会选择前往伯爵的领地，他们会支付更多的费用来鼓励这种行为。",
	"For reasons I can't fathom, Harstvale and its surrounding mountain ranges host many tribes of ogres—indeed, not mere family groups, but whole tribes of them! Whereas elsewhere ogres seem to live like bears, near Hartsvale they act more like orcs. Thankfully the brutes are still too stupid for such complex tasks as working metal, but from what I heard in my time in the vale their culture is surprisingly sophisticated. Different tribes worship different gods, Vaprak being the one I heard most about, and these differences in religion apparently set the tribes against each other. From what I heard, both the giants and the people of Hartsvale hate the ogres, a fact for which I'm sure many are grateful. If one or more giants decided to organize the ogres, I don't know if any in Hartsvale could stand against them.": "由于我无法理解的原因，哈斯韦尔和它周围的山脉接纳了许多食人魔部落--事实上，不是单纯的家庭团体，而是整个部落的食人魔! 在其他地方，食人魔似乎像熊一样生活，而在哈茨谷附近，他们的行为更像兽人。值得庆幸的是，这些野蛮人对于加工金属这种复杂的工作来说还是太愚蠢了，但从我在谷地的时候听到的情况来看，他们的文化出奇地复杂。不同的部落崇拜不同的神，瓦普拉克是我听到最多的一个，而这些宗教上的差异显然使各部落之间相互对立。据我所知，巨人和哈茨谷的人都讨厌食人魔，我相信很多人都很感激这个事实。如果一个或更多的巨人决定组织食人魔，我不知道在哈兹维尔是否有人能对抗他们。",
	"Helm's Hold has stood as a place of watchfulness and protection for generations. Ever since its foundation by the Company of Crazed Venturers, travelers have used it as a safe place to rest and recuperate on their journeys. Even during the dark times when Helm ceased showing signs to his faithful, the priests and people at Helm's Hold kept their doors open and their eyes on the road, providing refuge to any who came in peace. This outlook was recently sorely tested, and I'm uncertain if Helm's Hold passed or failed the test.": "舵手之家作为一个守望和保护的地方已经存在了好几代。自从疯狂冒险者公司成立以来，旅行者们一直把它作为旅途中休息和修养的安全场所。即使在黑暗时期，赫尔姆不再向他的信徒们展示他的迹象，赫尔姆之所的牧师和人们仍然敞开大门，注视着道路，为任何和平到来的人提供庇护。这种观念最近受到了严峻的考验，我不确定赫尔姆之家是通过了考验还是失败了。",
	"Even though the Watcher was destroyed just prior to the Spellplague, the faithful toiled on through terrible times to complete a grand central temple for the good of the community and the glory of their god. The kindly clergy of this temple, dubbed the Cathedral of Helm, took in those who had been touched by the plague or rendered insane by the destruction of Mystra's Weave. Sadly, as all too often occurs, corruption crept into the settlement, in the form of predatory creatures and malefactors who sought to experiment on the unfortunates in the care of the temple.": "尽管 \"守望者 \"在法术瘟疫之前就被摧毁了，但为了社区的利益和他们的神的荣耀，信徒们在可怕的年代里努力工作，完成了一座宏伟的中央神庙。这座被称为 \"赫尔姆大教堂 \"的仁慈的神职人员接纳了那些被瘟疫触动的人或因神秘之网的毁灭而变得疯狂的人。可悲的是，就像经常发生的那样，腐败悄悄地进入了这个定居点，其形式是掠夺性的生物和恶意的人，他们试图在神庙照顾的不幸者身上进行实验。",
	"In time the leadership of Helm's Hold was itself corrupted, falling into the hands of a shapeshifting succubus, who turned many monks into willing servitors. When her machinations were at last revealed and the battle for Helm's Hold began, other otherworldly forces came to the fore: summoned devils, undead raised from the very crypts of the temple, and tentacled, jelly-skinned things whose origin I dare not consider. With the aid of adventurers from nearby Neverwinter, all were defeated and Helm's Hold at last cleansed.": "随着时间的推移，赫尔姆庄园的领导层也被腐蚀了，落入了一个变形的魅魔手中，她把许多僧侣变成了自愿的仆人。当她的阴谋最终被揭穿，争夺赫尔姆堡垒的战斗开始时，其他异世界的力量出现了：被召唤的魔鬼、从神庙的地窖中复活的亡灵，以及我不敢考虑其来源的触手状、果冻状的东西。在附近的永夜城的冒险者的帮助下，所有的人都被打败了，赫尔姆港终于得到了净化。",
	"Among those stalwarts who saved Helm's Hold was a member of the Order of the Gauntlet. This man was Javen Tarmikos, and seeing the horrors unleashed on the world in Helm's Hold, he found his own order at fault. The Order of the Gauntlet doesn't punish the criminal before the crime is committed. When evil arises, members of the order strike and strike hard, but they leave the orcs alone in their mountains and don't disturb dragons in their slumber. After Helm's Hold, Javen found this philosophy flawed. Evils unlooked for can breed in the shadows, growing stronger until they attack. This seemed particularly true of otherworldly threats, such as portals to fiendish realms, evil spirits that seek to possess the living, and the corrupting influences of alien planes.": "在那些拯救赫尔姆港的中坚力量中，有一位高塔骑士团的成员。这个人就是贾文-塔米科斯，看到在赫尔姆港释放给世界的恐怖，他发现自己的骑士团有错。高塔骑士团并不在犯罪之前惩罚罪犯。当邪恶出现时，骑士团的成员会进行打击，而且打击力度很大，但他们让兽人独自呆在山里，不打扰龙的沉睡。在赫尔姆港之后，贾文发现这种哲学有缺陷。未被关注的邪恶可以在阴影中滋生，越来越强大，直到它们发动攻击。这似乎对其他世界的威胁来说尤其如此，比如通往魔界的门户、试图占有活人的恶灵，以及异界的腐蚀影响。",
	"Javen says he was ruminating on this when he received a sign of Helm's return. In the main chapel, the faithful had erected a new symbol of Helm after the last had been desecrated. Javen says he was gazing at this symbol and meditating on his order's failure when Helm's unblinking eye wept tears of gold. Soon after, uncorrupted priests of Helm's Hold, men and women who had remained ever watchful for Helm's return, experienced their own divine signs. In response to prayers, some were even rewarded with spells. Javen took those priests and followers from the Order of the Gauntlet loyal to him and formed a new order, swearing them in under the watchful gaze of Helm's still-weeping eye.": "贾文说，他正在思考这个问题时，收到了赫尔姆回归的迹象。在主礼拜堂里，信徒们在最后一个被亵渎后竖起了一个新的赫尔姆的标志。贾文说他正凝视着这个标志，沉思着他的教团的失败，这时赫尔姆那只不眨眼的眼睛流下了金色的眼泪。不久之后，赫尔姆之家未受腐蚀的祭司们，那些一直守候着赫尔姆归来的男人和女人，都经历了自己的神迹。作为对祈祷的回应，有些人甚至得到了法术的奖励。杰文从高塔骑士团带走了那些忠于他的牧师和追随者，并组建了一个新的骑士团，在赫尔姆那双仍在哭泣的眼睛的注视下，让他们宣誓就职。",
	"The Order of the Gilded Eye is dedicated to protecting the world and good people by rooting out hidden evils and severing connections with other planes. According to their members, it's not enough to fight threats that arise. Many lives can be saved if the signs of evil and those who dabble in darkness are actively sought out and destroyed before they open the gateways to larger threats. Since its founding, the Order of the Gilded Eye has grown in number and its capacity to deal with threats, welcoming exorcists, abjurers, and spies, as well as paladins and clerics of Helm. I've even heard that assassins bear the order's symbol—Helm's eye upon a golden gauntlet curled into a fist—and it is a claim I can't disregard. The Order of the Gilded Eye can be brutal in their pursuit of evil.": "镀金之眼骑士团致力于通过根除隐藏的邪恶和切断与其他星球的联系来保护世界和善良的人们。据他们的成员说，光是对抗出现的威胁是不够的。如果积极寻找邪恶的迹象和那些涉足黑暗的人，并在他们为更大的威胁打开大门之前将其消灭，就可以拯救许多人的生命。自成立以来，镀金之眼骑士团的人数和应对威胁的能力都在增长，欢迎驱魔人、驱魔人和间谍，以及圣骑士和赫尔姆的牧师。我甚至听说刺客们带着该组织的标志--在一个蜷缩成拳头的金色铠甲上的赫尔姆之眼--这是我不能不考虑的说法。镀金之眼骑士团在追捕邪恶时可以很残忍。",
	"Did Helm's symbol weep as Javen Tarmikos and others have said? If it did, was Javen's creation of this order Helm's intention? Is the Helm that has returned from death different from the god whose worship was familiar to me in my youth? How can we mortals know? Helm was ever a god of watchfulness and protection, but that didn't make him a just god, nor a kindly one.": "赫尔姆的符号是否如贾文-塔米科斯和其他人所说的那样哭泣了？如果是这样，贾文创造这个秩序是赫尔姆的意图吗？死而复生的赫尔姆与我年轻时熟悉的那个崇拜的神是否不同？我们凡人怎么能知道呢？赫尔姆曾经是一个守望和保护的神，但这并不意味着他是一个公正的神，也不是一个善良的神。",
	"Whatever the truth may be, know this: The Order of the Gilded Eye controls Helm's Hold now. If you hide evil in your heart, or if there is the whiff of something otherworldly about you, ride on. You'll find no sanctuary there.": "无论真相如何，请知道这一点。镀金之眼骑士团现在控制着赫尔姆港。如果你心中隐藏着邪恶，或者如果你身上有一丝异世界的气息，请继续前进。你在那里找不到避难所。",
	"Helm's Hold is still a relatively small settlement: a handful of streets that encircle a central marketplace, with sturdy stone-and-timber embankment walls all the way around. In the center of town sits the Heartward, a large marketplace with several rows of stalls radiating out from its central feature, an old gallows that doesn't see much use these days. The market is so named for the shrine to Sune that once stood along its edge. That shrine has since been replaced by a recently constructed temple to Lady Firehair, called the Heartward Hall.": "赫尔姆港仍然是一个相对较小的定居点：少数几条街道环绕着一个中央集市，周围都是坚固的石头和木头堤坝。镇中心是 \"向心\"（Heartward），这是一个大型集市，有几排摊位从中心位置向外辐射，这是一个古老的绞刑架，如今已不怎么使用。市场因其边缘曾经矗立的苏内神龛而得名。那座神龛后来被最近建造的火海夫人神庙所取代，称为向心厅。",
	"Not far from Heartward lies the town hall, a former inn that has been turned into the council building where the Speakers of Helm's Hold meet. The Speakers are the duly elected representatives of the hold, numbering eight in all, plus the Chief Speaker. The current Chief Speaker is Amarandine Wanderfoot, an older halfling matron who was an adventurer in her day. The Speakers work closely with the Holy Watcher to see to the proper governance of the hold.": "离 \"向心 \"不远的地方有一个市政厅，这个曾经的旅店已经变成了议会大楼，赫尔姆堡的议长们在这里开会。议长们是该地区正式选出的代表，总共有八名，加上首席议长。目前的首席议长是阿玛兰丁-万德福（Amarandine Wanderfoot），她是一位年长的半身人女性，在她的时代是一位冒险家。议长们与神圣守望者紧密合作，以确保对教区的适当管理。",
	"A short distance from the town hall lies the Venturer's Rest, a favorite stopping-off point of adventurers in the area, and of the locals who like to sit at the bar and listen to the tales such folk bring with them. The Rest was until recently called the Old Dirty Dwarf, but was rechristened by its new owner, a winsome Chauntean paladin by the name of Kharissa Anuvien. Dame Kharissa claims that one of her ancestors was in the Company of Crazed Venturers, associated with the founding of Helm's Hold, and her quick-rising popularity among the people has won her a seat as a Speaker.": "离市政厅不远的地方是 \"冒险者之家\"，它是该地区冒险者最喜欢的停靠点，也是当地人喜欢坐在酒吧里听这些人带来的故事的地方。直到最近，\"休息处 \"还被称为 \"肮脏的矮人\"，但被它的新主人重新命名，他是一位漂亮的Chauntean圣骑士，名字叫Kharissa Anuvien。卡里萨女士声称她的一个祖先曾是疯狂冒险者公司的成员，与赫尔姆港的建立有关，而她在人们中迅速上升的人气为她赢得了一个议长席位。",
	"Dominating the skyline of the hold is the great edifice: the Cathedral of Helm. As much a fortification as it is a temple, the cathedral has a small building on its grounds that serves as an orphanage, wards for caring for the sick and injured, as well as a newer addition that houses the mad and deformed who have been brought up from the catacombs.": "主宰该岛天际线的是一座伟大的建筑：赫尔姆大教堂。大教堂既是一个防御工事，也是一座神庙，它的地面上有一个小建筑，作为孤儿院，照顾病人和伤员的病房，以及一个较新的补充，容纳从地下墓穴中被带出来的疯子和畸形者。",
	"The settlement enjoys prosperity today, but such benefit was hard-won and requires vigilance to retain. Helm's Hold is vulnerable on many fronts, in large part because of its proximity to Neverwinter Wood—which, if anything, has become more dangerous in recent times. Rumors of maddened treants abound, as well as stories of Uthgardt barbarians once again raiding the trails that lead to the hold.": "今天，这个定居点享有繁荣，但这种好处来之不易，需要保持警惕。赫尔姆港在许多方面都很脆弱，这在很大程度上是因为它靠近永夜森林--如果说有什么变化的话，那就是近来变得更加危险。关于疯狂的树人的传言比比皆是，还有乌斯加德的野蛮人再次袭击通往该地的小路的故事。",
	"Worse still, the Holy Watcher has seen premonitions of something unspeakable rising from the depths beneath the hold, bringing down the lowest vaults of the cathedral in its bloody ascension. As a result, the temple has dramatically increased guard patrols in the tunnels, perhaps as a prelude to hiring adventurers to explore the tunnels deep under Helm's Hold for some clue of what those visions might portend.": "更糟糕的是，神圣守望者看到了一些不可告人的东西从船坞下面的深处升起的预感，它在血腥的上升过程中把大教堂最底层的拱顶都掀翻了。因此，神殿大幅增加了隧道里的守卫巡逻，也许这是雇冒险家探索赫尔姆堡垒下的隧道的前奏，以寻找那些预示着什么的线索。",
	"Anyone with even a hint of elven blood can't help but feel it stir upon setting foot in the High Forest. The sheer age and the power of the trees, the depth of their roots, and the wind whispering through their leaves—all these things call to us.": "任何拥有哪怕是一丝精灵血统的人在踏入高等森林时都会情不自禁地感受到它的激荡。树木纯粹的年龄和力量，它们根系的深度，以及穿过树叶的风声--所有这些都在召唤着我们。",
	"A vast green cloak in the midst of the North, the High Forest is a reminder of ages past, when thick woods blanketed much of Faerûn, and sylvan creatures of all types lived among the trees. Even today the High Forest has barely known the tread and touch of humans, and old growth dominates its flora.": "高山森林是北方的一个巨大的绿色斗篷，它让人想起过去的时代，那时茂密的树林覆盖了法鲁恩的大部分地区，各种类型的森林生物生活在树丛中。即使在今天，高级森林也几乎不知道人类的脚步和触摸，古老的植物群落在这里占主导地位。",
	"Elven communities in the forest are typically small and often nomadic. In part, this is a reflection of the desire to keep the woods untouched, but there are ruins here, such as those of Ascalhorn—now called Hellgate Dell—that remind us of the fallen cities and empires of the past.": "森林中的精灵社区通常很小，而且经常是游牧民族。在某种程度上，这反映了人们希望保持森林不被破坏的愿望，但这里也有一些废墟，比如阿斯卡霍恩的废墟--现在叫地狱之门--提醒我们过去的城市和帝国的衰落。",
	"The High Forest once sheltered three great elven realms beneath its boughs, and the bones of those empires still lie tangled in its roots. Many tribes of wood elves—and a few moon elf tribes—still roam the wood protecting these ruins, the monuments to their golden age. Few beyond the borders of the High Forest know much about these elves, who have no single leader and make little contact with the outside world. Travelers in the High Forest must always be wary of elves they meet for they can never be sure of their welcome, and any promises of safe passage might not be honored by the next band of elves.": "高等森林曾经在它的枝桠下庇护过三个伟大的精灵王国，那些帝国的骨头仍然在它的根部纠缠着。许多木精灵部落和一些月精灵部落仍然在森林中游荡，保护着这些废墟，这些黄金时代的纪念碑。在高级森林的边界之外，很少有人知道这些精灵的情况，他们没有单一的领袖，也很少与外界接触。在高级森林的旅行者必须始终对他们遇到的精灵保持警惕，因为他们永远无法确定自己是否受到欢迎，而且任何安全通行的承诺都可能不会被下一队精灵所兑现。",
	"One elf is leading the effort to change this situation. Known as the Red Lady, or simply the Lady of the Wood, Morgwais is a wood elf who seeks to unite the disparate tribes. She leads the Caerilcarn, the \"Council of the Wood,\" which periodically gathers many tribal leaders together to share information, consult, and deliberate. Her stated aim is to resurrect the kingdom of Eaerlann, and she has made bold steps in that direction by allying the settlements of Nordahaeril, Reitheillaethor, and Teuveamanthaar (which most know as Tall Trees). As yet though, the elves who believe in this vision are small in number and spread far apart over the eastern reaches of the High Forest.": "一个精灵正在领导改变这种状况的努力。莫格怀斯被称为 \"红夫人\"，或者干脆说是 \"森林夫人\"，她是一名森林精灵，试图将不同的部落团结起来。她领导着 \"森林议会\"（Caerilcarn），定期将许多部落领导人聚集在一起，分享信息，协商和审议。她宣称的目标是复活Eaerlann王国，她已经在这个方向上迈出了大胆的步伐，将Nordahaeril、Reitheillaethor和Teuveamanthaar（大多数人都知道是高树）的定居点联合起来。然而，相信这个愿景的精灵们数量不多，而且分散在高等森林的东部地区。",
	"Fey and sylvan creatures of all sorts—including satyrs, dryads, and treants—inhabit the High Forest. Small wonder that one almost immediately feels the presence of unseen watchers upon entering the woods.": "各种各样的精灵和森林生物--包括萨提尔、干尸和树人--都居住在高等森林中。难怪人们一进入森林就会立刻感觉到看不见的监视者的存在。",
	"Nowhere in the forest is this feeling more palpable than near the Grandfather Tree, an oak larger than you might imagine possible, which serves as a holy site for the Treeghost tribe of the Uthgardt. Four smaller oaks—enormous indeed, though still smaller than the Grandfather—mark the boundaries of the site, protecting the tree and aiding those whom its spirits determine are worthy, speeding their natural healing. Teleportation magic often goes awry here, and the caverns deep beneath the site are rumored to contain all manner of magical portals.": "在森林中，这种感觉最明显的地方莫过于祖父树附近，这棵橡树比你想象的要大，它是乌斯加德树鬼部落的一个圣地。四棵较小的橡树--虽然仍比祖父树小，但确实很巨大--标志着这个地方的边界，保护着这棵树，并帮助那些它的精神认为值得帮助的人，加速他们的自然愈合。传送魔法在这里经常出错，而且据传该地下面的洞穴深处有各种形式的魔法传送门。",
	"If it isn't the elves, the fey, or the trees themselves watching visitors, it might be the centaurs who make the High Forest their home, claiming the plateaus near the head of the Unicorn Run. For decades, the centaurs have been growing in number, enough so that they may soon divide their tribes and claim additional lands as their territory. Pegasi and unicorns can be found here, and even some of the fabled aarakocra, the winged birdfolk, live among the peaks at the heart of the wood.": "如果不是精灵、费伊或树木本身在监视游客，那可能是半人马，他们把高级森林作为自己的家，要求独角兽之路附近的高原。几十年来，半人马的数量一直在增长，足以让他们很快就会分出部落，并要求获得更多的土地作为他们的领土。这里可以找到飞马和独角兽，甚至还有一些传说中的阿拉科克拉，有翅膀的鸟人，生活在森林中心的山峰之间。",
	"Within the depths of the forest is an entire mountain range known as the Star Mounts. Constant strong winds keep weaker flying creatures from approaching the peaks of the mountains, with the strange exception of the aarakocra, who had an ancestral homeland there before being chased out by a dragon. Most the peaks may be viewed only from afar, and at a distance they seem to glitter from the strange, massive crystals dotting their slopes. They are also known to hold rich deposits of iron and nickel, but no one has mined these mountains in hundreds of years.": "在森林的深处有一整条山脉，被称为 \"星辰山\"。持续不断的强风使弱小的飞行生物无法接近山峰，只有阿拉科克拉是个奇怪的例外，在被龙赶走之前，他们在那里有一个祖传的家园。大多数山峰只能从远处观看，从远处看，它们似乎在山坡上点缀着奇怪的、巨大的水晶，闪闪发光。众所周知，它们还蕴藏着丰富的铁和镍的矿藏，但几百年来没有人在这些山上开采过。",
	"The Star Mounts are the source of the waters of the Unicorn Run, which cuts through the rocks of the lower range to form a series of gorges and cliffs known as the Sisters. The sight of the tiered waterfalls is positively breathtaking, well worth the challenge of reaching them. Mist shrouds the Sisters, and feeds the vegetation on the small plateaus of the area. To the north, the headwaters of the Dessarin River flow down from a smaller pair of mountains called the Lost Peaks.": "星形山是独角兽河水的源头，河水穿过下部山脉的岩石，形成一系列被称为姐妹的峡谷和悬崖。层层叠叠的瀑布让人叹为观止，值得我们去挑战。雾气笼罩着姐妹花，滋养着该地区小高原上的植被。在北部，德萨林河的上游从一对较小的山峰流下，称为失落的山峰。",
	"Far less idyllic are the cursed ruins of Karse. Here are the remains of the great heresy of the Netherese wizard Karsus, who sought to claim godhood, slew the goddess of magic, and brought about the end of an age and untold destruction across the entire world.": "被诅咒的卡尔斯废墟就不那么田园了。这里是尼瑟斯巫师卡尔萨斯的伟大异端的遗迹，他试图声称自己是神，杀死了魔法女神，并带来了一个时代的结束和整个世界的无尽破坏。",
	"The High Moor was once a place much like the High Forest or the nearby Misty Forest, but during the Crown Wars, thousands of years ago, powerful magic burned the land such that all that remained was a blasted moor. It is a rocky wilderness infested with trolls and goblinoids and all manner of other dangers for anyone who treks across it instead of going around.": "高荒原曾经是一个很像高森林或附近的迷雾森林的地方，但在几千年前的王室战争中，强大的魔法烧毁了这片土地，以至于只剩下一个被炸毁的荒原。它是一个多石的荒野，有巨魔和哥布林诺人出没，对于任何徒步穿越而不是绕道而行的人来说都有各种危险。",
	"As the name suggests, the High Moor is a raised area extending for many miles of heath, lichen-covered outcroppings, and hidden gullies. Herd animals wander the land, from sheep to rock ponies to the occasional rothé. These beasts graze without great risk, because wolves and other predators that would thin the herds are themselves the prey of the trolls and goblinoids that otherwise rule the moor. These two-legged threats sometimes seed the High Moor with traps, but are normally occupied with fighting and killing their prey and each other. There is something of a cycle to the hunts of the High Moor: wolves are killed off by the hobgoblins one year, leading to more sheep grazing, which brings the trolls out (the local trolls enjoy mutton, it seems), which brings intrepid adventurers to deal with the growing menace, enabling just enough of the wolves to survive that they aren't wiped out completely.": "顾名思义，高沼泽地是一个延伸数英里的高地，由荒草、地衣覆盖的突出部分和隐藏的沟壑组成。成群结队的动物在这片土地上游荡，从绵羊到岩石小马，再到偶尔出现的罗特犬。这些动物在吃草时没有很大的风险，因为狼和其他捕食者会削弱畜群，而他们本身就是巨魔和妖精的猎物，否则就会统治荒野。这些两条腿的威胁有时会在高沼泽地种下陷阱，但通常都忙于战斗，杀死它们的猎物和彼此。高原荒原的狩猎有一定的周期性：有一年狼群被妖精杀死，导致更多的羊群吃草，这让巨魔出来（当地的巨魔似乎喜欢吃羊肉），这让无畏的冒险家来处理日益增长的威胁，使狼群有足够的生存能力，不至于完全被消灭。",
	"Human barbarians also inhabit the High Moor, living mostly on its western fringes with large herds of sheep and goats, the soil being too thin and too poor for farming. They aren't Uthgardt or related to them, but they might have some distant ties to the Northlanders, as they seem to be of Illuskan stock. They speak a dialect of Illuskan I'd not heard before, and my first meetings with them were quite tense and filled with misapprehension. However, I came to know people from both the Girondi and Belcondi tribes, all of whom acted with bravery, honor, and good humor in my presence. Travelers in this region should note that the human tribes share the suspicion of magic common among many Northlanders, but thankfully it isn't the fanatic hatred shown by the Uthgardt.": "人类野蛮人也居住在高沼泽地，他们主要生活在西部边缘，有大量的绵羊和山羊，土壤太薄，太贫瘠，不适合耕作。他们不是乌斯加德人，也与他们没有关系，但他们可能与北地人有一些遥远的联系，因为他们似乎是伊鲁斯坎人的后代。他们说的是我以前没有听过的伊鲁斯坎方言，我和他们的第一次见面相当紧张，充满了误解。不过，我后来认识了吉隆迪和贝尔康迪部落的人，他们在我面前都表现得很勇敢，很有荣誉感，而且很幽默。在这个地区的旅行者应该注意到，人类部落与许多北地人一样对魔法抱有怀疑，但值得庆幸的是，这并不是乌斯加特人所表现出来的狂热仇恨。",
	"There are also some small orc tribes, Redclaw and Blue Feather, among them. The humans and goblinoids both despise the orcs, and my hosts said they allied with one another in the past when the orcs grew great in number.": "还有一些小兽人部落，红爪和蓝羽就是其中之一。人类和地精都鄙视兽人，我的主人说他们在过去兽人数量大增的时候就互相结盟。",
	"For such a large expanse, the High Moor contains few known ruins. One such is Orogoth, the former villa of a noble family of old Netheril. Local legends say the family dabbled in dragon magic, attempting to capture those powerful wyrms and acquire their powers. The tales differ as to what folly led to the family becoming immolated in its home, but most agree the culprit was a dracolich, of all things, residing in the ruin and defending the family's wealth. The gods only know what led to the creation of such a creature or what binds it to this place. The answers—if any there be—lie within its lair.": "在如此广阔的土地上，高沼泽地所包含的已知遗迹很少。Orogoth就是其中之一，它曾是旧尼瑟尔的一个贵族家庭的别墅。当地传说，这个家族涉足龙的魔法，试图捕捉那些强大的巫妖并获得他们的力量。至于是什么愚蠢的行为导致这个家族在家中被烧死，传说不尽相同，但大多数人都认为罪魁祸首是居住在废墟中并保卫家族财富的龙人。诸神只知道是什么导致了这种生物的产生，或者是什么将它束缚在这个地方。答案--如果有的话--就在它的巢穴里。",
	"West of the High Moor but heavily influenced by it, the Misty Forest draws its name from the fog that rolls off the heights of the moor to shroud its trees. Melandrach, King of the Woods, rules here and holds the forest as the exclusive domain of the elves. Though game animals roam in plenty, the local humans know well that the elves protect them and punish trespassers who poach in the forest. Even barbarians know better than to hunt here, as they don't wish to draw Melandrach's attention or ire.": "迷雾森林位于高沼泽的西部，但深受其影响，它的名字来自于从高沼泽的高处滚落的雾气，笼罩着它的树木。森林之王梅兰德斯（Melandrach）统治着这里，将森林作为精灵的专属领地。虽然野味很多，但当地的人类清楚地知道，精灵会保护他们，并惩罚那些在森林里偷猎的入侵者。即使是野蛮人也知道最好不要在这里打猎，因为他们不希望引起梅兰德斯的注意或愤怒。",
	"Travelers who leave the inhabitants of the Misty Forest alone, and who build their campfires small and solely of fallen branches, are usually permitted to pass, so long as the folk of the forest aren't in a foul mood or stirred up against outsiders for some other reason.": "旅行者如果不打扰迷雾森林的居民，并且只用掉落的树枝搭建小规模的篝火，通常会被允许通过，只要森林里的居民没有闹情绪或者因为其他原因而对外来者产生不满。",
	"Just off the High Moor, on the north bank of the Delimbiyr near the Unicorn Run, is the small town of Secomber, on the border between the North and the settlements of the Western Heartlands. Built over the ruins of Hastarl, capital of the ancient kingdom of Athalantar, Secomber is a quiet place where fishers and farmers go about their work, and local folk hire out to hunt or fish, or guide travelers through the area. Skilled guides who know the High Moor well, and can navigate its many dangers and its local tribes, are common—or appear to be, given how often their services are offered. Local stonecutters, primarily from a small clan of dwarves, excavate pink granite from the rock walls on northern edge of the moor.": "就在高沼泽边上，在独角兽之路附近的德林拜尔河北岸，是塞孔伯小镇，位于北方和西部心脏地带的定居点之间。塞孔伯建在古代阿塔兰塔王国的首都哈斯塔尔的废墟上，是一个安静的地方，渔民和农民在这里工作，当地人雇人打猎或捕鱼，或为旅行者做向导。熟练的向导对高沼泽地非常熟悉，能够驾驭它的许多危险和当地部落，他们很常见--或者说看起来很常见，因为他们的服务经常被提供。当地的石匠，主要来自矮人的一个小部族，在荒原北部边缘的岩壁上挖掘粉红色的花岗岩。",
	"Stories persist that Faer'tel'miir, an ancient city of Miyeritar, was restored by High Magic sometime in the last century—perhaps even before the Spellplague—up on the High Moor. The restored city of dark, smooth stone, called Rhymanthiin, or \"The Hidden City of Hope,\" appears on no maps, and is reputedly concealed by magic or some other artifice. Supposedly only those who are worthy, without malice in their hearts, may reach it, while others (as the tales have it) \"shall not find their way there.\" Such tale-tellers must be few and far between, as I know of no one who can rightly claim to have seen it, but still the stories seem to have a life of their own.": "故事持续不断，Faer'tel'miir，Miyeritar的一座古城，在上个世纪的某个时候被高级魔法修复了--也许甚至在法术瘟疫之前，在高荒原上。这座被修复的城市由黑暗、光滑的石头构成，被称为Rhymanthiin，或 \"隐藏的希望之城\"，没有出现在地图上，据说是被魔法或其他一些装置所掩盖。据称，只有那些有资格、心中没有恶意的人可以到达那里，而其他人（正如传说中的那样）\"将无法找到他们的路\"。这样的说书人肯定很少，因为我知道没有人可以正确地声称自己看到了它，但这些故事似乎仍然有自己的生命力。",
	"Gone are the days when the tales of a kingdom of serpents were rumor and hearsay, stories concocted by adventurers and travelers who strayed far off the path and somehow managed to escape. It was once easy to doubt their veracity, for what nation didn't patrol its borders or establish communication (amicable or otherwise) with other nations? The stories of naga and yuan-ti were easy enough to believe, for this area had always hosted such things. But a nation of such creatures?": "关于大蛇王国的传说已经一去不复返了，这只是谣言和道听途说，是冒险家和旅行者编造出来的故事，他们偏离了道路，却以某种方式成功逃脱。曾经很容易怀疑它们的真实性，因为哪个国家不在其边界巡逻或与其他国家建立沟通（友好或其他）？纳迦和元天的故事很容易相信，因为这个地区一直都有这样的东西。但一个拥有这种生物的国家？",
	"As we now know, the kingdom of Najara, as proclaimed by the serpents that live within, lies along the northern edge of the Trade Way, northeast of Boareskyr Bridge and southeast of the High Moor. The Winding Water flows through these lands, and its other main geographical features are the Serpent Hills, the Marsh of Chelimber, and the Forest of Wyrms.": "正如我们现在所知，纳贾拉王国，正如生活在其中的大蛇所宣称的那样，位于贸易之路北部边缘，博阿雷斯基尔桥的东北部和高沼泽的东南部。缠绕之水流经这些土地，它的其他主要地理特征是蛇山、Chelimber沼泽和Wyrms森林。",
	"I discovered for myself the truth of Najara, the Kingdom of Serpents, when a sage in Baldur's Gate hired me to guide him, his apprentices, and a handful of adventurers to some ruins in the eastern edges of the High Moor. I will forever regret accepting that commission, for not only did half the adventurers turn out to be greedy swine intent on plundering the ruins rather than allowing the sage his study, but their idiocy awoke an ancient spirit that caused most of the group to drop off into a deathly sleep while it consumed their souls. Since I am unaffected by magics that force slumber, I escaped, along with a half-elf among the apprentices to the sage. The spirit chased us across the moors relentlessly, forcing us into the tunnels beneath the Serpent Hills, where we were taken prisoner by yuan-ti patrolling the borders of their domain. The half-elf was hauled away in slaver's chains, but for some reason I was taken to the court of Jarant, the Serpent King. A brief account of that experience follows.": "我自己发现了蛇之国纳贾拉的真相，当时博德之门的一位圣人雇佣我引导他、他的学徒和少数冒险者去高沼泽东部的一些遗迹。我将永远后悔接受这个委托，因为不仅一半的冒险者变成了贪婪的猪，打算掠夺废墟而不是让圣人研究，而且他们的愚蠢唤醒了一个古老的灵魂，导致大多数人陷入了死亡的睡眠，同时它吞噬了他们的灵魂。由于我不受强迫沉睡的魔法影响，我和圣人的学徒中的一个半精灵一起逃了出来。灵魂在荒野上无情地追赶我们，迫使我们进入蛇山下的隧道，在那里我们被在他们领域边界巡逻的元老们俘虏了。那个半精灵被奴隶主的锁链拖走了，但由于某种原因，我被带到了蛇王贾兰特的宫廷。下面是对这段经历的简要叙述。",
	"Ancient and evil, the spirit naga Jarant rules the kingdom by virtue of his personal power and thanks to the aid of the marlspire of najara, a thin silver crown that has protective and other magical abilities. Though he still preferred to remain utterly isolated from the outside world at the time when I met him, ten years ago the Dark Serpent began sending ambassadors to neighboring kingdoms to warn them about the consequences of interfering in Najaran matters. Though I saw the king for but a moment, Jarant's influence in his realm is undeniable, for his name is spoken reverently by all his subjects. A guard might swear \"by Jarant's crown\" to emphasize an edict, and the yuan-ti who owned the keys to my shackles referred to Najara's laws as \"Jarant's will.\"": "古老而邪恶的精神纳迦-贾兰特凭借他个人的力量，并感谢纳迦拉的马尔斯皮尔的帮助来统治这个王国，这个薄薄的银冠具有保护和其他魔法能力。虽然在我见到他的时候，他仍然喜欢与外界完全隔绝，但十年前，黑暗之蛇开始向邻近的王国派遣大使，警告他们干涉纳贾兰事务的后果。虽然我见到国王的时间不长，但贾兰特在他的王国里的影响力是不可否认的，因为他的名字被所有的臣民恭敬地提起。一个卫兵可能会以 \"贾兰特的王冠 \"起誓来强调一项法令，而拥有我的镣铐钥匙的元老们则把纳贾拉的法律称为 \"贾兰特的意志\"。",
	"No one knows why Jarant chose the time he did to make public his kingdom's sovereignty, or what he hoped to gain by such an act. The yuan-ti ambassadors he sent forth made their king's wishes clear to the nations they visited: leave Najaran prosperity alone, and discourage intruders (such as adventuring types) from violating Najaran borders to steal the fortunes of the serpentfolk. In return, the serpents promised that any caravans and other legitimate travelers passing through Najara's dominion would be unharmed and unhindered—as long as they don't stray from the main route.": "没有人知道为什么贾兰特要选择这个时候公开他的王国的主权，也没有人知道他希望通过这种行为获得什么。他派出的元老级使者向他们所访问的国家明确表达了他们的愿望：不要打扰纳贾兰的繁荣，并阻止入侵者（如冒险者）侵犯纳贾兰的边界，窃取蛇人的财富。作为回报，大蛇们承诺，任何经过纳贾兰统治区的商队和其他合法旅行者都不会受到伤害和阻碍--只要他们不偏离主要路线。",
	"Reaction among the places approached raged from one extreme to the other. Darkhold reportedly feted the ambassadors well, and the serpentfolk left with not only an agreement from the Zhentish lords, but also an offer of a possible future military alliance. Not surprisingly, Elturgard refused the edict outright—and in the process of expressing that refusal, bloodshed erupted. The paladins slew all but one of the ambassadors, and sent the survivor back to Jarant's court to communicate their answer.": "接近的地方的反应从一个极端激荡到另一个极端。据报道，Darkhold很好地招待了这些大使，蛇人离开时不仅得到了Zhentish领主的同意，而且还提出了未来可能的军事联盟。毫不奇怪，艾尔图加德断然拒绝了这项诏书--在表示拒绝的过程中，爆发了流血事件。圣骑士们杀死了所有的大使，只有一个例外，并将幸存者送回贾兰特的宫廷，传达他们的答案。",
	"The other responses to the Najaran ambassadors fell somewhere in between. Acceptances and refusals to cooperate, usually polite, trickled in, but regardless of their substance, Jarant's goal had been accomplished: Najara's neighbors now saw the realm as a nation, no matter whether they viewed it as a potential ally or foe.": "对纳贾兰大使的其他回应则介于两者之间。接受和拒绝合作，通常都是礼貌性的，涓涓细流，但无论其内容如何，贾兰特的目标已经完成了。纳贾拉的邻国现在把这个王国看作是一个国家，无论他们把它看作是一个潜在的盟友还是敌人。",
	"The economy of Najara, such as it is, depends on slaves to exist. Slavery is arguably the only actual trade conducted in Najara, with the ruins of Thlohtzin in the Forest of Wyrms serving as a gathering place for those who would stoop so low as to sell slaves to the yuan-ti. Different factions among the Najarans have agents waiting near Thlohtzin, each hoping to strike a bargain with slavers before others arrive. Slaves with unusual abilities or specialized knowledge sometimes set off bidding wars among the yuan-ti. I fear that such was the fate of that apprentice who accompanied me out of the High Moor.": "纳贾拉的经济，比如说，是依靠奴隶而存在的。奴隶制可以说是纳贾拉唯一进行的实际贸易，巫师森林中的Thlohtzin废墟是那些愿意屈尊将奴隶卖给元帝的人的聚集地。纳贾兰人中的不同派别都有代理人在Thlohtzin附近等候，每个人都希望在其他人到来之前与奴隶主达成交易。具有特殊能力或专业知识的奴隶有时会在元老院中引发竞价大战。我担心那个陪我离开高摩尔的学徒的命运就是如此。",
	"To everyone of any influence who might read this, heed my words: do not be misled. The serpents do not intend to coexist peacefully—they merely wish to use their strange diplomacy as a cloak and a shield, to protect them against the vigilance of others until they are ready to put their plans, whatever they may be, into fruition.": "对每一个可能读到这篇文章的有影响力的人，请注意我的话：不要被误导。大蛇并不打算和平共处--它们只是希望用它们奇怪的外交手段作为斗篷和盾牌，保护它们不受其他人的警惕，直到它们准备好将它们的计划，无论它们是什么，付诸实施。",
	"I was imprisoned in Ss'khanaja, a mostly subterranean city on the Winding Water, where gathers the court of King Jarant.": "我被囚禁在Ss'khanaja，这是一个位于Winding Water的大部分地下城市，那里聚集了Jarant国王的宫廷。",
	"During my time in the custody of the Najarans, I learned much about—and from—Dhosun Silverscale. A yuan-ti pureblood in Najara, Dhosun acts as a councilor to the king and often seeks to mitigate Jarant's excesses. I believe that the sending out of the ambassadors was Dhosun's idea, for while I was imprisoned, he visited me several times, asking what I knew of the arts of embassy and ambassadorship. From the talk at court, Dhosun makes no secret of his desire to help his king build a nation whose status equals or outmatches other realms across the face of Faerûn. Jarant keeps him near, it is said, because of all the king's courtiers, Dhosun is the likeliest to attempt to steal away the Marlspire. Whether or not he is capable of such an act, I found the yuan-ti naga to be honorable—it was he who secretly arranged the opportunity I needed to escape, and I know he has done likewise for others in the past. I owe him a debt I intend to repay one day.": "在我被纳贾拉人看管的这段时间里，我从多森-银鳞那里学到了很多东西。多森是纳贾拉的一个元老级纯种人，他是国王的顾问，经常试图减轻贾兰特的过激行为。我相信派出大使是多逊的主意，因为在我被囚禁期间，他曾多次探望我，问我对使团和大使的艺术有何了解。从宫廷里的谈话来看，多森毫不掩饰他希望帮助他的国王建立一个地位等同于或超过法鲁恩其他王国的国家的愿望。据说，贾兰特把他留在身边，因为在国王的所有朝臣中，多森是最有可能试图偷走马尔斯皮尔的人。不管他是否有能力做出这样的行为，我发现这个元老级的纳迦人是可敬的--是他秘密安排了我需要的逃跑机会，而且我知道他在过去也为其他人做过同样的事。我欠他一个人情，我打算有一天要偿还。",
	"Another figure of note in the court is the cunning green dragon Emikaiwufeg, often called the Emerald Daughter. She is young for a dragon and still small enough to fit in tunnels leading down to Jarant's audience chamber. Jarant is said to appreciate the twists and turns of her wit. Some courtiers believe that she is frequently kept to hand as a foil to Dhosun, as her slickly vicious nature offsets the Dhosun's more honorable tendencies. For my part, I believe she's biding her time. A great many metallic dragons dwell in the Serpent Hills, and a clear rival for mates, wealth, and power—the green dragon known as Ralionate—lives in the nearby forest of Wyrms.": "宫廷中另一个值得注意的人物是狡猾的绿龙埃米凯乌费格，通常被称为翡翠之女。作为一条龙，她还很年轻，而且还小到足以适应通往贾兰特的觐见厅的隧道。据说贾兰特很欣赏她那曲折的智慧。一些朝臣认为，她经常被保留在手边，作为多森的陪衬，因为她狡猾凶恶的天性抵消了多森的更多荣誉倾向。就我而言，我相信她在等待时机。许多金属龙居住在蛇山，而一个明显的竞争对手，即被称为 \"拉里奥纳特 \"的绿龙，居住在附近的维尔姆森林。",
	"A variety of advisors and hangers-on can be found within Jarant's court, which is a dangerous place. A trio of yuan-ti warlocks, who claim to have tapped into the vestiges of the ancient serpent deity once worshiped at Ss'thar'tiss'ssun, leads the yuan-ti of Najara, though at court they frequently lurk in the background, simply watching.": "在贾兰特的宫廷里可以找到各种顾问和挂名者，这是个危险的地方。三位元老级术士，声称已经挖掘出曾经在Ss'thar'tiss'sun崇拜的古代蛇神的残余，领导着纳贾拉的元老级，尽管在宫廷中他们经常潜伏在后台，只是在观察。",
	"The Serpent Hills is a desolate region of red clay hills and deep, treacherous ravines, featuring stretches of rough, ridged land surrounding tall mesas. Only scrub can manage to grow here, tenaciously clinging to the dry clay. Beneath this perilous territory—filled with serpents and poisonous creatures of all manner—lie the Serpent Ways, a series of intricate, well-guarded tunnels interspersed with caverns and chambers. The passages serve as the main pathways for the folk of Najara through these lands; indeed, it was while resting within such a cavern that the half-elf apprentice and I were captured by yuan-ti. I have since learned that in general, the serpents don't care who tromps over the hills, so long as they stay out of the places under them. The Najaran capital city, Ss'khanaja, is found in the northwest of the Serpent Hills, but an even larger population of snakefolk live beneath the surface. It is common to find settlements inside the large underground chambers connected by the tunnels, excavations many centuries in age.": "蛇山是一个由红色粘土山丘和深邃险恶的峡谷组成的荒凉地区，以高大的中轴线周围绵延不绝的粗糙山脊土地为特色。只有灌木能在这里生长，顽强地依附在干燥的粘土上。在这片充满危险的土地下，充满了各种形式的蛇和有毒的生物，这就是蛇道，一系列错综复杂、守卫森严的隧道，其中穿插着洞穴和房间。这些通道是纳贾拉人穿越这些土地的主要通道；事实上，我和半精灵学徒就是在这样的洞穴中休息时被元老们抓走的。我后来了解到，一般来说，大蛇并不在意谁在山上乱闯，只要他们不在山下的地方。纳贾兰人的首都，斯卡纳贾，位于蛇山的西北部，但在地表下生活着更多的蛇人。在由隧道连接的大型地下室中发现定居点是很常见的，这些挖掘物已有好几个世纪的历史。",
	"I didn't have occasion to travel to Chelimber before my \"sojourn\" with the Narajan court, but I did ask Dhosun about the place. It was through those questions that he divined my intention to escape, in fact, and offered his aid. A vast marshland pocked with sulfurous pools that often gout their steaming contents high into the air, the marsh is inhospitable even to most serpents; the majority of the denizens in these lands are lizardfolk. Once a Netherese principality, ruled by vampires, and then a holding of the Zhentarim, the Marsh of Chelimber is solidly within the grasp of Najara today. Though each tribe of lizardfolk is dominated by a chieftain from among their kind, each of those leaders has sworn fealty to the King of Najara.": "在我 \"寄居 \"在纳拉扬宫廷之前，我没有机会到Chelimber去，但我确实向Dhosun询问了那个地方。事实上，正是通过这些问题，他看出了我的逃跑意图，并提供了帮助。这是一片广阔的沼泽地，到处都是硫磺池，它们经常把冒着热气的东西喷到空中，沼泽地甚至对大多数蛇类都是不友好的；这些土地上的大多数居民是蜥蜴人。曾经是尼瑟斯公国，由吸血鬼统治，后来成为镇塔林的控股区，今天，Chelimber沼泽已被Najara牢牢地控制住。尽管每一个蜥蜴人部落都由他们的一个首领主宰，但每一个首领都对纳贾拉国王宣誓效忠。",
	"In the end, it was through the Forest of Wyrms that I fled Najara, though Dhosun advised me against doing so. Ultimately, I chose it for the same reason he tried to discourage me: because only a fool would enter this wood intentionally. The forest is infested with a great many serpents of both normal and monstrous varieties.": "最后，我是通过巫师森林逃离纳贾拉的，尽管多森建议我不要这样做。最终，我选择了它，原因与他试图劝阻我的理由相同：因为只有傻瓜才会故意进入这片森林。这片森林里有许多正常和畸形的蛇类出没。",
	"Sages who have studied the serpent-life of the forest claim that some force seems to draw ophidian creatures here and then changes them—varieties of snake that ought not be poisonous bite with envenomed fang in this forest, and most breeds of snake grow to nearly double their size here. Ralionate, an ancient green dragon apparently not aligned with the yuan-ti, makes this forest her lair. It is good terrain for her; tall redwoods and coarse pines create a dense, dark canopy.": "研究过森林中蛇类生物的圣人声称，某种力量似乎将蛇类生物吸引到这里，然后改变它们--在这片森林中，各种不应该有毒的蛇用带毒的獠牙咬人，大多数品种的蛇在这里生长到几乎两倍大小。拉里昂纳特（Ralionate）是一条古老的绿龙，显然不与元帝结盟，她把这片森林当作自己的巢穴。这对她来说是很好的地形；高大的红木和粗大的松树形成了一个密集的、黑暗的树冠。",
	"Dhosun warned me that the ruins of Ss'thar'tiss'ssun, an ancient temple-city, lie in the northern fringes of the forest. At some point in the distant past, humans built a small settlement, once called Serpent's Cowl, above these ruins, but it now stands empty, likely due to the depredations of yuan-ti. Though discernible as little more than low hills in the forest today, Dhosun told me that deep inside the ruins lies the Shrine of the Cowled Serpents, a site of pilgrimage for the serpent-folk.": "Dhosun警告我，Ss'thar'tiss'ssun的废墟，一个古老的寺庙城市，位于森林的北部边缘。在遥远的过去的某个时刻，人类在这些废墟上建造了一个小的定居点，曾被称为 \"蛇之冠\"，但现在已经空无一人，可能是因为元帝的掠夺。虽然今天在森林中只能看到一些低矮的山丘，但多森告诉我，在废墟的深处有一个 \"蛇头 \"神殿，是蛇人的朝圣地。",
	"A place of great danger within the forest is Thlohtzin, once the citadel of a lich and now an important site in Najara's slave trade. Slavers from around the region know that the serpent-folk pay good coin for slaves brought here. They are then usually transported to other places in Najara for service.": "森林中一个非常危险的地方是Thlohtzin，它曾经是一个巫师的堡垒，现在是纳贾拉奴隶贸易的重要地点。来自该地区的奴隶主们知道，蛇人族为带到这里的奴隶支付了大量的钱财。然后他们通常会被运到纳贾拉的其他地方服务。",
	"I chose to make my escape from Najara through the Forest of Wyrms because, though serpent-infested, it is a woodland yet, and I am at home in such places. I moved through its shadows, remaining deep enough within the forest to avoid notice but not so far as to come near its heart, and then skirted its edges until I could see the hills of Trielta in the distance.": "我选择通过巫师森林逃离纳贾拉，因为虽然有蛇出没，但它是一片林地，而我在这种地方很自在。我穿过它的阴影，在森林里保持足够的深度以避免被注意到，但又不至于接近它的中心，然后绕过它的边缘，直到我可以看到远处特里尔塔的山丘。",
	"In the rolling terrain of the Trielta Hills, scattered with small settlements of gnomes and halflings, life seems pastoral and idyllic. Halfling farmers tend to their plots, and gnome miners scrape out the interior of the hills seeking the bits of gold and silver they may find waiting there. No warlords threaten this land, no liches or dragons plot to seize it for themselves. There are no great castles to covet here, nor ruins to pillage. All told, the place seems dull and unremarkable.": "在特里尔塔山连绵起伏的地形上，散布着地精和半身人的小定居点，生活似乎是田园牧歌式的。半身人农民照料他们的土地，而地精矿工则在山丘内部寻找他们可能在那里发现的金银碎片。没有军阀威胁这片土地，也没有地精或龙谋划为自己夺取它。这里没有伟大的城堡可以觊觎，也没有废墟可以掠夺。总的来说，这个地方似乎很沉闷，不值得一提。",
	"That, of course, is just the way its residents like it. They enjoy their solitude, which is broken only rarely. The hills of Trielta do occasionally offer up some impressive bounty, in the form of heretofore-undiscovered gold and silver. While such finds are usually small lodes that are played out almost before others become aware of them, Trielta has played host to full-on gold rushes from time to time. Someone stumbles on a particularly large vein of ore, and prospectors and fortune-seekers come pouring in by the dozens. Trieltan folk tend to see these occasional influxes of gold-hungry seekers the way other settlements look upon periodic plagues of locusts: aggravating, inevitable, and thoroughly disruptive, but also part of the natural order, and so nothing to get bothered about.": "当然，这正是其居民喜欢的方式。他们享受自己的孤独，这种孤独很少被打破。特里尔塔的山丘偶尔会提供一些令人印象深刻的赏金，形式是以前未被发现的金和银。虽然这种发现通常是小矿井，几乎在别人意识到它们之前就已经被玩完了，但特里尔塔也不时出现过全面的淘金热潮。有人偶然发现了一个特别大的矿脉，探矿者和寻宝者就会成群结队地涌入。特里尔塔人倾向于像其他定居点看待周期性蝗虫灾害那样看待这些偶尔涌入的淘金者：令人不快、不可避免、彻底破坏，但也是自然秩序的一部分，所以没有什么可烦恼的。",
	"Indeed, even the largest of these discoveries isn't so lucrative as to be worth the construction of the full-scale mining operations that can be found in other lands. No large nations or trading consortiums are waiting in the wings to invade and take over the mines of Trielta. They are what a dwarf acquaintance of mine once referred to as \"scratch mines\"—close-to-the-surface operations, with decent yield for a small amount of digging, but not worth the construction of \"proper\" (by which he of course meant dwarven) mines.": "事实上，即使是最大的发现也不是那么有利可图，以至于不值得在其他土地上建造大规模的采矿作业。没有大国或贸易财团在等待入侵并接管特里尔塔的矿场。它们就是我的一个矮人熟人曾经提到的 \"零星矿场\"--接近地表的作业，对于少量的挖掘来说产量还不错，但不值得建造 \"正规\"（当然他指的是矮人）的矿场。",
	"I was in Trielta resting after my escape from Najara when just such an outbreak of \"gold on the brain\" (as the locals term it) occurred. Though most of those who come at such times are honest prospectors seeking to make their fortunes, the sudden opportunity for wealth does attract less scrupulous sorts, including all manner of thieves, swindlers, and claims-jumpers—not to mention monsters that prey on unlucky or ill-prepared miners who unknowingly invade their territory.": "我从纳贾拉逃出来后在特里尔塔休息时，就发生了这种 \"脑子里有黄金\"（当地人称之为 \"黄金\"）的情况。虽然在这种时候来的大多数人都是诚实的探矿者，想要发财，但突然出现的发财机会确实吸引了一些不那么严谨的人，包括各种类型的小偷、骗子和跳楼者，更不用说那些捕食不走运或准备不足的矿工的怪物，他们在不知不觉中侵入了他们的领地。",
	"The most intense traveling I've done through these hills was in pursuit of a band of marauding lizardfolk. The head of the kindly gnome family I was staying with was taken prisoner, along with his oldest son. I helped the local halfling sheriff and the small band of militia he put together to track the band, and to do so quickly, rescuing the captives. I've been welcomed in this area ever since, and have gotten to know the goodly folk here well.": "我在这些山上做的最紧张的旅行是为了追捕一伙掠夺性的蜥蜴人。我所住的那个善良的地精家族的族长和他的大儿子都被俘虏了。我帮助当地的半身人警长和他组建的一小队民兵追踪这支队伍，并迅速完成了任务，救出了被俘者。从那以后，我在这个地区受到了欢迎，并与这里的好心人混得很熟。",
	"At the southern edge of the hills lies the walled settlement of Hardbuckler. It is a town of mostly gnomes, with the occasional human, halfling, or half-elf among their number. It is one of the best-defended towns I've visited, with a several batteries of ballistae on impressive cog-run cranking mounts that allow for a nearly constant cycle of firing and reloading from any of the wall emplacements. Though the folk of Hardbuckler don't have cause to use them very often, these weapons usually discourage the bandits, raiders, and occasional orc bands that would lay claim to Hardbuckler's wealth.": "在山丘的南部边缘，是有墙的哈德巴克勒定居点。这是一个主要由地精组成的城镇，偶尔也有人类、半身人或半精灵。这是我访问过的防御最严密的城镇之一，在令人印象深刻的齿轮式曲柄支架上有几组弹炮，可以从任何一个城墙炮台上进行近乎持续的循环射击和重新装弹。虽然哈德巴克勒的居民并不经常使用这些武器，但这些武器通常能阻止强盗、袭击者和偶尔出现的兽人团伙对哈德巴克勒的财富提出要求。",
	"The town eschews the sort of street network that tends to delineate most large settlements; instead it has a single street running inside the circular town wall, and another pair of straight roads crossing the town north-to-south and east-to-west that meet in the center of town in a crossroads marketplace. Many buildings structured for larger folk line these streets, for taller folk tend to prefer the comfortable familiarity they provide, but the rest of the town is made up of a series of narrow paths between the smaller-proportioned buildings that are the homes of the city's gnomes.": "该镇避开了大多数大型定居点的街道网络；相反，它有一条在环形城墙内运行的街道，还有一对从北到南和从东到西穿过小镇的直路，在镇中心的十字路口集市上相遇。这些街道上有许多为大块头建造的建筑，因为高个子的人往往更喜欢它们提供的舒适的熟悉感，但城镇的其余部分是由一系列狭窄的路径组成的，这些小比例的建筑是城市侏儒的家。",
	"The first time I walked along these tight lanes, I felt as though I was only seeing a small portion of the actual settlement, and I was right. Later I discovered that beneath the slate-roofed houses, with their modest little adjoining gardens behind plank fences or fieldstone walls are the tunnels that constitute the true thoroughfares of Hardbuckler.": "我第一次沿着这些狭长的小道行走时，觉得自己好像只看到了实际居住区的一小部分，我是对的。后来我发现，在这些板屋顶的房子下面，在木板围栏或田园石墙后面，是构成哈德巴克勒真正的大道的隧道，它们都有不大的相邻的小园子。",
	"Beneath each small dwelling is an extensive cellar, often three or more levels in depth. These spaces are where the industrious folk of Hardbuckler engage in their livelihoods. Some of the cellar spaces are shops or workspaces for artisans who sleep in the house above. Other of these croftholds rent out their extra space to travelers, setting aside a few rooms for rent, and using a single large space as an open taproom, serving the sort of fare one might find in an inn. The food in such an establishment is odd—a great deal of mushrooms, potatoes, turnips, dense lichens, and stews made of shrews and voles—but filling and tasty in its own way.": "在每个小住宅的下面都有一个广泛的地窖，通常有三层或更多的深度。这些空间是哈德巴克勒勤劳的人们从事其生计的地方。有些地窖空间是商店或工匠的工作场所，他们在上面的房子里睡觉。还有一些酒庄将多余的空间出租给旅行者，留出几个房间出租，并将一个大空间作为开放的酒窖，提供客栈中可能出现的那种酒水。这种场所的食物很奇怪--大量的蘑菇、土豆、萝卜、密集的地衣，以及用鼩鼱和田鼠做的炖菜--但以其特有的方式充实和美味。",
	"The chambers in these underground inns are well heated by generous hearths, and thus provide for very comfortable accommodations. More than a few merchants arrange their travels so as to be in Hardbuckler ere winter arrives, so that they can spend the cold months beside a hearth, with a slice of fried pie in one hand, and a tankard of bitter gnomish stout in the other.": "这些地下旅馆的房间都有宽敞的壁炉供暖，因此提供了非常舒适的住宿条件。许多商人安排他们的旅行，以便在冬天到来之前到达哈德巴克勒，这样他们就可以在壁炉旁度过寒冷的几个月，一手拿一块油炸馅饼，一手拿一罐苦涩的地精啤酒。",
	"Any cellar space not devoted to another purpose is used for storage rather than being left vacant. Almost every family in the town has some space that it uses for its own needs or rents out for use by others. Those who buy storage from a Hardbuckler must purchase their storage crates and other necessary goods from local artisans, who also make locks, latches, waxy sealants for waterproofing crates and boxes, and the like. The crates are all built to specific sizes, with shelving and space in the cellars measured so that each container fits snugly and exactly.": "任何没有用于其他目的的地窖空间都被用于储存，而不是空置。镇上几乎每个家庭都有一些空间，用于自己的需要或出租给他人使用。那些从哈德巴克尔购买存储空间的人必须从当地工匠那里购买存储箱和其他必要的物品，他们还制造锁、门闩、用于防水箱和盒子的蜡质密封剂等等。箱子都是按照特定的尺寸制造的，地窖里的架子和空间都是经过测量的，以便每个容器都能紧紧地、准确地贴在一起。",
	"Hardbuckler has a well-paid wizard who provides magical security for stored items, for those who wish it. Outlander wizards aren't permitted to lay wards or protections on goods destined for the cellars—such must be applied by Daelia Inchtarwurn, the latest wizard in a long line of folk who have worked in Hardbuckler over the generations. She wears a set of magical bracers passed to her by her father.": "哈德巴克勒有一位报酬丰厚的巫师，为那些希望得到的储存物品提供魔法保障。外地人的巫师不允许在运往地窖的货物上设置防护装置或保护措施--这必须由戴丽亚-英希塔伍恩（Daelia Inchtarwurn）来实施，她是在哈德巴克勒工作的一长串人中最新的巫师。她戴着一套由她父亲传给她的魔法手镯。",
	"Most of the outlying settlements in the Trielta Hills consist of a dozen or two dozen halfling or gnome families, living in homes molded gently into rolling hills. Relatively shallow valleys serve as agricultural land, while the slopes are used for growing vine crops (such as pumpkins and strawberries) or grazing small herds of the large-horned sheep many of the halfling families keep, or the ornery braid-bearded goats favored by gnome goatherds.": "特里尔塔山的大多数外围定居点由十几个或二十几个半身人或地精家庭组成，住在平缓地塑造在起伏的山丘上的房子里。相对较浅的山谷作为农业用地，而山坡则用于种植藤蔓作物（如南瓜和草莓），或放牧许多半身人家庭饲养的小群大角羊，或地精牧羊人喜爱的辫子胡须山羊。",
	"Most of these small communities aren't exclusively populated by halflings or gnomes, since such groups seem to prosper better when members of both races are in residence. Halfling families often focus on agricultural endeavors (aside from the small fungi gardens many gnomish households maintain in their cellars), while the area's miners are almost exclusively gnomes. Both folk work as herders, with halflings favoring sheep, and gnomes goats, as well as artisans of all sorts. Each community has a sheriff who maintains peace and leads defense—a role most often fulfilled by a halfling, I've found, though gnomes will certainly rise up in defense of their homes and neighbors when called upon.": "这些小社区中的大多数并不完全由半身人或地精居住，因为当两个种族的成员都在这里居住时，这样的群体似乎更繁荣。半身人家庭通常专注于农业工作（除了许多地精家庭在地窖里保留的小型真菌花园），而该地区的矿工几乎全是地精。这两种人都是牧民，半身人喜欢羊，而地精喜欢山羊，同时也是各种工匠。每个社区都有一个维持和平和领导防御的警长--我发现这个角色最常由半身人完成，尽管地精在被召唤时肯定会站出来保卫他们的家园和邻居。",
	"Some of the rural settlements mark the former locations of mines that have been played out. It isn't uncommon for halflings to move in where a gnomish mine have been abandoned, fixing up the surface entrances into acceptable, comfortable homes, with built-in tunnels that worm through the settlement. These passages might be helpful for defense or escape, but they are most often used when it's raining out to reach a neighbor's door and borrow a cup of honey, so as not to get oneself wet or track mud everywhere.": "一些农村居民点标志着已被开采的矿场的旧址。半身人搬到地精矿场被遗弃的地方并不罕见，他们把地表的入口修理成可以接受的、舒适的家，内置的隧道蜿蜒穿过定居点。这些通道可能对防御或逃跑有帮助，但它们最常被用来在下雨天到达邻居家门口借一杯蜂蜜，这样就不会把自己弄湿或把泥巴弄得到处都是。",
	"On occasion, a community that sports large dwelling-tunnels, with ample space for larger folk (or \"big'uns,\" as the local gnomes say), turns its settlement into an establishment that caters to such clientele. The inns I know of are the Merry Mine-Lass, the Pipe and Hearthstone, and the Giants' Respite, my favorite.": "偶尔，一个社区有大型的住宅--隧道，有足够的空间给大块头（或当地地精说的 \"大块头\"），就会把它的定居点变成一个迎合这种顾客的场所。我知道的旅馆有 \"快乐的矿工\"、\"烟斗和炉石\"，以及我最喜欢的 \"巨人的休息\"。",
	"Each of these settlements is impressively self-sustaining. When official leadership is needed, the eldest halflings and gnomes are called upon to act in that capacity, but amity is the heart of community life in these hills. It is a shameful act among the Trieltans to refuse to reach a peaceable accord with one's fellows over some dispute. The folk here enjoy their simple lives, although I've come across a half-dozen or so young adventurers who hail from here, seeking out the newness of the world as a contrast to the familiarity of their homeland.": "这些定居点中的每一个都是令人印象深刻的自给自足。当需要官方领导时，最年长的半身人和地精会被要求以这种身份行事，但友好是这些山丘社区生活的核心。在特里尔坦人中，拒绝与自己的伙伴就某些争端达成和平协议是一种可耻的行为。这里的人们享受他们简单的生活，尽管我遇到过半打左右来自这里的年轻冒险家，他们寻求世界的新鲜感，与他们熟悉的故乡形成对比。",
	"Few dangerous creatures lurk in the hills—they are so densely settled (on and beneath the surface) that there is little space for monsters to lair. Cruel or ravenous creatures do occasionally creep into Trielta, mainly from the Forest of Wyrms, but such incursions don't last long—after a few sheep (and possibly a shepherd or two) are eaten, the sheriffs waste no time in forming a posse to hunt down or chase off the predators before they can do more harm.": "很少有危险的生物潜伏在山上--它们是如此密集地定居（在地表上和地表下），以至于没有什么空间可供怪物栖息。残忍或贪婪的生物偶尔会潜入特里尔塔，主要来自巫妖森林，但这种入侵不会持续很久--在几只羊（可能还有一两个牧羊人）被吃掉后，警长们会毫不犹豫地组成一个小队，在捕食者造成更大伤害之前将其赶走。",
	"Now, sad to say, this situation might be changing for the worse. According to recent letters I have received from friends in these hills, parties of Najaran raiders have become more common and numerous. My friends fear that the threat from the Serpent Kingdom to the north will force Trieltans to seriously consider putting up an active defense of their lands for the first time in generations.": "现在，不幸的是，这种情况可能正在发生变化，变得更糟。根据我最近从这些山上的朋友那里收到的信件，纳贾兰人的突击队已经变得更加普遍和众多。我的朋友们担心，来自北方大蛇王国的威胁将迫使特里尔特人认真考虑积极防御他们的土地，这是几代人以来的第一次。",
	"When I was newly departed from my homeland and first found my way to the North, I encountered a band of Uthgardt nomads on the trail—a part of the Elk tribe, led by a warrior named Gyrt. It was a tense meeting.": "当我刚离开家乡，第一次找到去北方的路时，我在路上遇到了一队乌斯加德游牧民族--麋鹿部落的一部分，由一个叫Gyrt的勇士领导。那是一次紧张的会面。",
	"I think the only reason I was not killed on sight is that I was an elf traveling alone. I think they feared I was a wizard. Uthgardt hate all magic but that of their shamans and any enchanted weapons and armor they find, but a wizard willing to walk the wilds alone could be a powerful one. Traveling as we were on a grassy plain, we could see one another for some distance. Since I didn't strike them down with lightning from afar, they were willing to approach peaceably.": "我想我没有被当场杀死的唯一原因是，我是一个独自旅行的精灵。我想他们担心我是个巫师。除了他们的巫师和他们发现的任何被施了魔法的武器和盔甲之外，乌斯加德特人讨厌所有的魔法，但一个愿意独自行走在荒野上的巫师可能是一个强大的人。我们在一个长满草的平原上行走，我们可以看到彼此的一段距离。由于我没有从远处用闪电击倒他们，他们愿意和平地接近。",
	"Still, they stopped when they were within bowshot and seemed to be arguing about whether to shoot me. I waited as patiently as I could until one who seemed to be their leader addressed me in heavily accented Common. I replied a greeting in Bothii, their own ancient language, which again set the group to argument. At last, the leader dismounted and approached me, giving her name as Gyrt. Glad was I then that I took the time to learn the language from a learned friend in Evereska!": "不过，当他们进入弓箭射程时，他们还是停了下来，似乎在争论是否要向我开枪。我尽可能耐心地等待，直到其中一个似乎是他们的领袖的人用口音很重的普通话对我说话。我用他们自己的古老语言Bothii回答了一句问候，这又让这群人争论起来。最后，领头的人下了马，走到我面前，说她的名字叫Gyrt。我很庆幸自己花时间向埃弗里斯卡的一位学识渊博的朋友学习这种语言。",
	"In anticipation of any demand, I offered Gyrt a fine dagger from Evereska, as well as a necklace I wore. For her band I offered a bag of baubles I'd brought for such an occasion. Pleased with my gifts and assured that I was no wizard, Gyrt and I sat down to talk. I asked to share her campfire for the night, and Gyrt made space for me. That was my first meeting with Gyrt, but it wouldn't be my last, nor my last encounter with Uthgardt. I'm grateful to my friend Gyrt for teaching me so much about her people, for it has allowed me and many fellow travelers to see Uthgardt and live to tell the tale.": "考虑到任何需求，我向盖特提供了一把来自埃弗里斯卡的精美匕首，以及我佩戴的一条项链。对于她的乐队，我提供了一袋我为这种场合带来的小饰品。我对我的礼物很满意，并保证我不是巫师，盖特和我坐下来交谈。我要求在她的篝火旁过夜，盖特为我留出了空间。这是我与盖特的第一次见面，但这不会是我的最后一次，也不会是我与乌斯加德的最后一次相遇。我很感谢我的朋友Gyrt教给我这么多关于她的人民的知识，因为这让我和许多同行看到了乌斯加德特，并活到了现在。",
	"Over the years, as I earned Gyrt's respect and she mine, we became friends, and I came to know her three sons as well. Though Gyrt died some decades ago, I still visit her children, whom I played with when they were young. They now have children of their own, and all call me auntie.": "多年来，由于我赢得了吉尔特的尊重，她也赢得了我的尊重，我们成了朋友，我也认识了她的三个儿子。虽然Gyrt在几十年前就去世了，但我仍然去看望她的孩子们，我在他们小的时候和他们一起玩。他们现在都有自己的孩子，都叫我阿姨。",
	"During my time with Gyrt and her kin, the people of the Elk explained much to me about the workings of their tribe—their view of the world and their place in it, their traditions and the laws they live by. I came to realize, as I came across other Uthgardt tribes in my travels, that much of what is true for the Elk tribe is true for other Uthgardt. Though they comport themselves in seemingly disparate groups honoring different totems, Uthgardt have much in common. What follows is what I have learned of the people who call themselves \"children of Uthgar.\"": "在我与Gyrt和她的亲属相处的过程中，麋鹿人向我解释了很多关于他们部落的运作情况--他们对世界的看法和他们在其中的位置，他们的传统和他们生活的法律。当我在旅行中遇到其他乌斯加德人部落时，我逐渐意识到，对麋鹿部落来说，很多事情对其他乌斯加德人来说也是如此。尽管他们以貌似不同的群体来尊重不同的图腾，但乌斯加德人有许多共同之处。以下是我对那些自称为 \"乌斯加尔的孩子 \"的人的了解。",
	"Though the Uthgardt each belong to a given tribe, these are markers of identity, rather than coherent populations. In my experience, it is rare outside of occasional large events (such as the ascension of a new chieftain, or certain religious gatherings) for all members of a single tribe to come together in one place. Instead, the Uthgardt tend to travel in bands, groups of tribesfolk that number between a dozen and a hundred, usually twenty to fifty. These bands generally consist of several family groups, each led by a matriarch or patriarch. In many ways, these folk are similar to nomadic Tel'Quessir, in that they make their decisions by consensus among the heads of the families, and disagreements are handled efficiently: those who don't like the decision of the majority go their own way, forming a new band or joining a different one.": "虽然乌斯加德人各自属于一个特定的部落，但这些都是身份的标志，而不是连贯的人口。根据我的经验，除了偶尔的大型活动（如新酋长的登基，或某些宗教集会）之外，很少有一个部落的所有成员聚集在一个地方。相反，乌斯加德人倾向于成群结队地旅行，这些部落成员的数量在十几到一百之间，通常是二十到五十人。这些队伍通常由几个家庭组组成，每个家庭组由一个族长或族长领导。在许多方面，这些人与游牧民族的泰尔奎西尔（Tel'Quessir）相似，他们通过家族首领之间的共识做出决定，并且有效地处理分歧：那些不喜欢大多数人决定的人走自己的路，组成一个新的乐队或加入一个不同的乐队。",
	"The Uthgardt are spread across the North, rarely found farther south than the High Forest. There is no nation of Uthgardt to which they belong; instead, each tribe has a central ancestral mound, regarded as a holy site. Gyrt told me that the holy site of the Elk tribe is at a place called Flint Rock, somewhere in the Evermoors. She, understandably, never offered to take me there, and I was never foolish enough to ask.": "乌斯加德人分布在北方，很少在比高森林更远的南方被发现。他们没有属于哪个国家的Uthgardt；相反，每个部落都有一个中央的祖先土丘，被视为圣地。吉尔特告诉我，麋鹿部落的圣地在一个叫燧石岩的地方，在Evermoors的某个地方。可以理解的是，她从未提出要带我去那里，而我也从未傻到去问。",
	"By and large, the Uthgardt are a hunting people who rely on game for much of their sustenance, favoring large herd animals such as elk, rothe, and deer. Young men and women looking to make a name for themselves sometimes build their reputations by hunting dangerous predators and great beasts: bears, great cats, large boar, and even monsters such as wyverns, owlbears, and displacer beasts.": "总的来说，乌斯加德人是一个狩猎民族，他们主要依靠野味来维持生计，偏爱大型的群居动物，如麋鹿、洛特和鹿。想要扬名立万的年轻男女有时会通过猎杀危险的掠食者和大型野兽来建立自己的名声：熊、大猫、大野猪，甚至还有狼獾、猫头鹰和流离兽等怪兽。",
	"Some tribes put the prowess they demonstrate in hunting to good use in another endeavor, for which the Uthgardt are well known: raiding. As a rule, the Uthgardt engage in raiding only in remote areas—meaning that the closer a potential target is to civilization, the less likely it will be set upon. The raiders prefer to strike against wealthy merchant caravans and nobles' baggage trains, which offer the likelihood of fine foods, alcohol, and jewelry that Uthgardt wear as trophies and trade among themselves. For the most part, Uthgardt have little use for coin, so travelers hoping to buy their way out of a confrontation are advised to offer something else.": "一些部落将他们在狩猎中表现出来的能力很好地运用到另一项工作中，乌斯加德人在这方面是很有名的：突袭。通常，乌斯加德人只在偏远地区进行突袭--这意味着潜在的目标离文明越近，被袭击的可能性就越小。袭击者更喜欢袭击富裕的商队和贵族的行李列车，因为它们有可能提供精美的食物、酒和珠宝，Uthgardt将其作为战利品佩戴并在他们之间进行交易。在大多数情况下，乌斯加德人对硬币没有什么用处，所以希望通过买东西来摆脱对抗的旅行者最好提供其他东西。",
	"Uthgardt don't see national boundaries or the bonds of civilization that tie a merchant to a farmer whose house the merchant passes on the road. To them each interaction with us—meaning we who aren't Uthgart—is different. Thus, an Uthgardt band that raids in one season might come to trade during the next. They do understand the concept of belonging to a larger group, and that those groups might be in conflict. After all, each tribe of Uthgardt has its ancestral enemies among the other Uthgardt tribes. Yet when I attempted to explain how I, and elf from Evereska, was connected to folk in Waterdeep or Silverymoon, Gyrt just laughed. She had not seen these cities, so I might as well have said I knew folk who lived on the moon. When I mentioned Yartar and Red Larch, places that I knew Gyrt's band had passed near, she laughed still harder. To her I was too great, too \"strong\" as she put it, to have any connection to places she saw as providing prey for her tribe.": "Uthgardt看不到国界，也看不到文明的纽带，这些纽带将一个商人和一个农民联系在一起，而商人在路上经过这个农民的房子。对他们来说，与我们--指的是我们这些非乌斯加特人--的每一次互动都是不同的。因此，一个在某个季节突袭的乌斯加特人队伍可能会在下一个季节来进行贸易。他们确实理解属于一个更大群体的概念，而且这些群体可能会发生冲突。毕竟，每个乌斯加德部落在其他乌斯加德部落中都有其祖先的敌人。然而，当我试图解释我这个来自Evereska的精灵是如何与Waterdeep或Silverymoon的民风联系起来的时候，Gyrt只是笑了笑。她没有见过这些城市，所以我还不如说我认识住在月亮上的人。当我提到雅尔塔和红落叶松，我知道盖特的乐队曾在附近经过，她笑得更厉害了。对她来说，我太伟大了，用她的话说，太 \"强大 \"了，与她认为为她的部落提供猎物的地方没有任何联系。",
	"If a band of Uthgardt come upon your campsite, my advice is this. First, do what you can to hide all signs of magic or spellcasting. Then show them hospitality and invite them to warm themselves. If you have jewelry or a fine weapon, offer these gifts to the one who seems like the leader. Ask how their hunting goes, and give them a chance to brag. Be appreciative, but not obsequious. Tell them you have heard of the prowess of the Uthgardt people—their hunting skills and strength first and foremost—but attribute these claims to a tribe other than their own. The strongest among the band will insist on the chance to prove him- or herself better than the stories you've heard, and will want you to bear away tales of about his or her tribe instead.": "如果一队乌斯加德人来到你的营地，我的建议是这样的。首先，尽你所能隐藏所有魔法或咒语的痕迹。然后向他们表示好客，邀请他们来取暖。如果你有珠宝或精美的武器，把这些礼物献给看起来像领袖的那个人。询问他们的狩猎情况，并给他们一个吹嘘的机会。要赞赏，但不要谄媚。告诉他们你听说过乌斯加特人的威力--他们的狩猎技巧和力量是最重要的--但要把这些说法归于他们自己以外的一个部落。队伍中最强壮的人将坚持要求有机会证明他或她比你听到的故事更好，并希望你带走关于他或她的部落的故事。",
	"You or one of your companions might need to agree to a challenge of some kind, a feat of strength or a bout of fisticuffs, by which the band may measure your prowess. It doesn't greatly matter if you win or lose, though. Simply express a desire or a willingness to compete, and you will earn some measure of respect. If you win the challenge, be gracious, and express gratitude that you finally found someone of great status to test yourself against. If you lose, be self-effacing and rueful, and give the victor the best part of the meal at hand.": "你或你的一个同伴可能需要同意接受某种挑战，一个力量的壮举或一场拳脚的较量，乐队可以以此来衡量你的能力。不过，赢或输并不重要。只要表达出竞争的愿望或意愿，你就会赢得某种程度的尊重。如果你赢得了挑战，要有风度，并表示感谢，因为你终于找到了一个地位很高的人来测试自己。如果你输了，要自我谦虚，毁誉参半，并把手头最好的那份饭菜给胜利者。",
	"This advice will not always work, of course. Some bands aren't so easily assuaged, particularly if they are out deliberately hunting you or folk like you. At all times, remember that these are a proud and strong people with a fierce love of life and its simple pleasures. Demonstrate an outlook complementary to theirs, and they might make of you a comrade. Show fear or contempt, and they will respond with quick violence.": "当然，这个建议并不总是有效。有些乐队不是那么容易被安抚的，特别是如果他们是在故意猎杀你或像你这样的人。在任何时候，都要记住，这些人是一个骄傲而强大的民族，对生活和简单的快乐有着强烈的热爱。表现出与他们互补的观点，他们可能会把你当做战友。如果表现出恐惧或蔑视，他们就会迅速做出暴力反应。",
	"The Uthgardt trace their origins back to the mighty hero Uthgar, a warrior without compare. During my time with his tribe, Gyrt spoke freely of the tales of Uthgar that have been passed down among his people. The saga begins in the distant past when the humans of the North lived in fear and isolation. Great spirits roamed the forests of the North, preventing humans from banding together to rise up against them. Into this turmoil came Uthgar, who challenged each of the great spirits, one at a time, besting them and subjugating them to his rule. Each of the defeated spirits became embodied in the totem of one of the groups of humans who followed and revered Uthgar. Thus were born the tribes of the Uthgardt, each taking the name of their totem spirit.": "乌斯加特人的起源可以追溯到强大的英雄乌斯加，一个无与伦比的战士。在我与他的部落相处期间，盖特畅谈了在他的族人中流传的厄斯加的故事。这个传奇故事开始于遥远的过去，当时北方的人类生活在恐惧和孤立之中。伟大的神灵在北方的森林中游荡，阻止人类联合起来反抗他们。在这场动乱中，乌斯加出现了，他一次一次地挑战每一个伟大的神灵，打败了他们，使他们屈服于自己的统治。每个被打败的精灵都体现在追随和敬仰厄斯加的人类群体的图腾中。因此，乌斯加的部落诞生了，每个部落都以其图腾精神为名。",
	"The sites of Uthgar's victories are marked even today with the great ancestor-mounds of the Uthgardt. Each is said to have been built over the remains of a tribe's totem spirit, along with the tribesfolk who died while helping Uthgar to fight the creature.": "即使在今天，乌斯加尔的胜利之地也被标记为乌斯加尔特的伟大祖先冢。据说每一个都是建立在一个部落的图腾精神的遗迹之上，还有那些在帮助厄斯加尔对抗生物时死去的部落成员。",
	"A tribe lays claim to the territory around its ancestral mound for many leagues, declaring it as the grounds in which the tribe hunts and sets up camps. Generally speaking, Uthgardt bands of a given tribe will range as far as two to three weeks' travel away from the tribe's ancestral mound, with raiding parties going much farther afield. These holy sites are scattered through the North; in almost all cases, the exact location of one is known to few people other than members of that tribe.": "一个部落对其祖先的土丘周围的领土提出要求，并将其宣布为部落狩猎和建立营地的地方。一般来说，某个部落的Uthgardt队伍会在离部落祖冢两到三周的范围内活动，突击队会去更远的地方。这些圣地散布在北方；几乎在所有情况下，除了该部落的成员外，很少有人知道其中一个圣地的确切位置。",
	"Almost all of the original tribes of the Uthgardt are active in the North today. Even a tribe thought to be lost or destroyed might be represented somewhere by a small number of humans who claim to be descended from the one of the tribes of old, but such people, where they exist, aren't numerous by any means, and their claims are often spurious.": "几乎所有乌斯加德人的原始部落今天都在北方活动。即使是一个被认为已经消失或毁灭的部落，也可能在某个地方由少数人类代表，他们声称是古老部落之一的后裔，但这样的人，在他们存在的地方，无论如何也不会很多，而且他们的主张往往是虚假的。",
	"The Uthgardt take their ritual practices and taboos very seriously. Most taboos and traditions vary from tribe to tribe, but at least one stricture is universal among the Uthgardt: magic other than that of the shamans or the magic of weapons and armor is forbidden.": "Uthgardt人非常重视他们的仪式惯例和禁忌。大多数禁忌和传统因部落而异，但至少有一个严格的规定在乌斯加德人中是通用的：除了巫师的魔法或武器和盔甲的魔法外，禁止其他魔法。",
	"The priests of the Uthgardt revere their ancestor-god and also invoke the names of their totems as intercessors with the Father of the Tribes. Their ethos is simple: strength is rewarded with more strength, and when strength fails, it is because a person is not worthy.": "Uthgardt的祭司们崇敬他们的祖先神，同时也援引他们图腾的名字作为与部落之父的交涉对象。他们的道德观很简单：力量会得到更多的回报，当力量失效时，那是因为一个人不配。",
	"For most Uthgardt tribes, the only stability in their history is the site of their ancestral mound. Most of the Uthgardt holy sites have existed since antiquity, but the fortunes of the tribes that revere them have hardly been static. Following are brief descriptions of the Uthgardt tribes today.": "对于大多数乌斯加德部落来说，他们历史上唯一稳定的地方就是他们祖先的土丘所在地。大多数乌斯加德人的圣地自古以来就存在，但崇尚这些圣地的部落的命运却几乎没有任何变化。以下是对当今乌斯加尔特部落的简要描述。",
	"The easternmost of the Uthgardt are the Blue Bear-thought destroyed more than a century ago-who have recently emerged from inside the High Forest and reclaimed their ancestral mound at Stone Stand, just south of the Moon Pass and north of the forest. The Blue Bears have reoccupied much of their old territory in the time since they returned to prominence, though they don't venture near Hellgate Keep, considering it a taboo place.": "乌斯加特人中最东边的是蓝熊人--人们认为他们在一个多世纪前就被消灭了--他们最近从高级森林里出来，在月亮山口以南、森林以北的石滩上收回了他们的祖先冢。蓝熊人在他们重获新生后，重新占领了大部分的旧领地，不过他们并没有冒险靠近地狱之门，认为那是一个禁忌之地。",
	"North of Blue Bear territory, in the Glimmering Wood, is Beorunna's Well, a settlement of some size that near the ancient ancestral mound of the Red Tiger tribe. The settlement was founded some time ago by members of the Black Lion tribe, who put down roots here rather than continuing to live as nomads.": "在蓝熊领地的北面，在闪光森林里，有一个Beorunna's Well，这是一个有一定规模的定居点，靠近红虎部落的古老祖先的土丘。这个定居点是由黑狮部落的成员在一段时间前建立的，他们在这里扎根，而不是继续作为游牧民生活。",
	"Though the Red Tigers are less than comfortable with the present situation, they consider Beorunna's Well their holy site, so they make the best of things. Bands of Red Tiger tribespeople often winter in Beorunna's Well, and many of its hunters and trappers use the settlement as a place to sell the leather and furs they acquire in nearby forests.": "虽然红虎人对目前的情况不太满意，但他们认为贝鲁纳之井是他们的圣地，所以他们把事情做到最好。成群结队的红虎部落居民经常在博伦纳之井过冬，许多猎人和捕猎者把这个定居点作为出售他们在附近森林中获得的皮革和毛皮的地方。",
	"In a part of the Glimmerwood called the Moonwood stands the One Stone, the ancestral mound of the Sky Pony tribe. These are a people divided; half of the tribe has settled and built a sizable steading around the One Stone, similar to what Black Lion has done at Beorunna's Well. The other half of the tribe considers this act an insult to their totem, so they launch raids on the settlement, burning as much of it as they can and then escaping, often on pegasus-back.": "在月光森林的一个地方，矗立着一块石头，那是天马部落的祖先冢。他们是一个分裂的民族；一半的部落已经定居下来，并在独石周围建造了一个相当大的堡垒，类似于黑狮在博伦纳之井的做法。另一半部落认为这种行为是对他们图腾的侮辱，所以他们对定居点发动袭击，尽可能多地烧毁定居点，然后逃跑，通常是骑着木马逃跑。",
	"In the depths of the High Forest stands the Grandfather Tree, the ancestral mound of the Tree Ghost tribe. The Tree Ghosts split off from the Blue Bears long ago and all but disappeared into the forest, although occasional reports reach civilization that they are still alive and can sometimes be seen clustered around the Grandfather Tree. Some sages postulate that the newly reborn Blue Bear tribe might well be Tree Ghost Uthgardt who are following a call from a revived Blue Bear totem.": "在高级森林的深处，矗立着一棵祖父树，这是树鬼部落的祖先冢。很久以前，树鬼从蓝熊部落中分裂出来，几乎消失在森林中，尽管偶尔有报告说他们仍然活着，有时可以看到他们聚集在祖父树周围。一些圣人推测，新近重生的蓝熊部落很可能是树鬼乌斯加德，他们在听从一个复兴的蓝熊图腾的召唤。",
	"The Frost Hills, a small southern spike of the Spine of the World Mountains just north of the Evermoors, is the site of Great Worm Cavern, the ancestral mound of the Great Worm tribe. These Uthgardt are notoriously reclusive; it has been twenty years since the tribe has sent raiding parties out anywhere but against the orcs of the Spine Mountains.": "冰霜丘陵是世界之脊山脉南部的一个小山峰，就在永恒荒野的北面，是大虫洞的所在地，是大虫部落的祖先冢。这些乌斯加德人是出了名的孤僻；除了对刺骨山脉的兽人之外，该部落已经有二十年没有派出过突击队了。",
	"As forbidding as the Spine of the World Mountains they roam, the Black Ravens are fanatical in their adherence to the old Uthgardt ways. Ranging out from Raven Rock, their ancestral mound deep inside the mountains, they have been known to send raiding parties as far south as Silverymoon, but their most frequent targets are the caravans that come in and out of Mithral Hall.": "就像他们所游荡的世界之脊山脉一样令人生畏，黑鸦人狂热地坚持着古老的乌斯加德特方式。他们从乌鸦岩（Raven Rock）--他们的祖先在山脉深处的土丘--出发，据说他们曾派出突击队远至银月（Silverymoon）南部，但他们最经常的目标是进出米特拉尔大厅的商队。",
	"Flint Rock in the midst of the Evermoors is the ancestral mound of the Elk tribe. The Elk were once prolific raiders, extending their reach even into Nesmé and Mithral Hall, but the tribe was shattered a handful of decades past by the forces of those cities. Though their numbers have replenished, the Elk remain mostly hunters and foragers. They are masters at avoiding or repulsing the threats of the Evermoors, and often hire themselves out as guides for outsiders.": "位于常春之地的燧石岩是麋鹿部落的祖坟。麋鹿族曾经是多产的掠夺者，他们的触角甚至延伸到了奈斯迈和米特拉尔厅，但在过去的几十年里，该部落被这些城市的力量击垮了。虽然他们的数量有所补充，但麋鹿族仍然主要是猎人和觅食者。他们是躲避或击退恒河沙数威胁的高手，并经常雇用自己作为外来者的向导。",
	"Given the rebirth of the Blue Bear tribe in recent years, it might be incorrect to assume that any Uthgardt tribe is truly extinct. Nevertheless, several tribes are known today only by prior reputation, not present accomplishments.": "鉴于近年来蓝熊部落的重生，认为任何乌斯加德特部落真的灭绝了可能是不正确的。然而，有几个部落今天只是靠以前的名声而不是现在的成就而为人所知。",
	"The {@b Thunderbeast} tribe has not been heard from in several years. When the Thunderbeasts made their annual pilgrimage to Morgur's Mound in Neverwinter Wood, they found their holy site desecrated. Soon thereafter, their chieftain took them back into the depths of the High Forest, and they have not emerged since.": "这个{@b Thunderbeast}部落已经好几年没有消息了。当雷兽每年到永夜森林的莫格尔之丘朝圣时，他们发现自己的圣地被亵渎了。此后不久，他们的首领将他们带回了高级森林的深处，此后他们就再也没有出现过。",
	"The {@b Gray Wolf} tribe, made up of lycanthropes, was destroyed by a Selûnite crusade because of the tribe's curse. Some of the surviving Gray Wolves took shelter among other Uthgardt tribes.": "由狼人组成的{@b Gray Wolf}部落，由于部落的诅咒，被塞鲁尼特人的讨伐行动所摧毁。一些幸存的灰狼人在其他乌斯加特部落中避难。",
	"The {@b Griffon} tribe came to an untimely end when it rose against the forces of Luruar allied with giants and orcs.": "当这个{@b Griffon}部落奋起反抗与巨人和兽人结盟的卢鲁尔的军队时，它的结局是不幸的。",
	"The {@b Red Pony} and {@b Golden Eagle} tribes vanished centuries ago. They were last seen in the vicinity of the One Stone, the ancestral mound those tribes shared with Sky Pony.": "{@b Red Pony}和{@b Golden Eagle}部落几个世纪前就消失了。他们最后一次出现是在 \"一石 \"附近，那是这些部落与 \"天马 \"共享的祖先冢。",
	"On the western edge of the Troll Hills lies an area of bizarre terrain: shattered rubble is strewn across the landscape, between and among mounds of upturned earth and deep furrows of the sort one commonly sees in the wake of trebuchet blows that miss their mark. Farther in from the perimeter of this blasted land lies a scattered mess of buildings, some relatively intact, others half-collapsed and leaning on their neighbors.": "在巨魔山庄的西部边缘，有一片地形怪异的区域：破碎的瓦砾散落在地表上，在翻起的土堆和深沟之间，这就是人们经常看到的那种被投石机击中后的失误。在这片被炸毁的土地的周边，散落着一些乱七八糟的建筑，有些相对完整，有些则是半倒塌，靠在邻居的身上。",
	"In the center, rising above it all, is a handful of twisted towers looking for all the world like talons clawing at the sky. These towers can be seen from a good distance, seemingly unharmed by the cataclysm that produced the damage around them. Indeed, because of their pristine condition, some folk conjecture that these towers must have been built after that event.": "在中心，在这一切之上，是少数几座扭曲的塔，看起来就像爪子在抓着天空。这些塔楼可以在很远的地方看到，似乎没有受到产生周围破坏的大灾变的影响。事实上，由于它们的原始状态，一些人猜测这些塔楼一定是在那次事件之后建成的。",
	"The truth of the place now called Warlock's Crypt is something different altogether. All of the structures visible here, from the now-shattered outbuildings to the central towers, comprised a city that floated atop a disc of stone during the time of ancient Netheril. When the ancient and wicked magics of the Netherese failed, this city plummeted from the sky; the chunks and slabs of stone scattered about the site are not natural terrain, but are the shards of that disc.": "现在被称为术士墓穴的地方的真相是完全不同的东西。这里所有可见的建筑，从现在破碎的建筑到中央的塔楼，都是由古代尼瑟尔时期漂浮在石盘上的城市组成的。当尼瑟尔古老而邪恶的魔法失效时，这座城市从空中坠落；散落在这里的大块和大块的石头并不是自然地形，而是那个圆盘的碎片。",
	"I have been to the Warlock's Crypt but once, in the days of my youth before I knew better. I was hired by Daerismun Aerath, one of the Avowed—the esteemed scholar-monks of Candlekeep—to guide him there. He was writing a treatise on the place and desired firsthand experience of the locale. Fresh as I was from Evereska, I'd never heard the warnings of the wise regarding this site. I am either extraordinarily beloved of Solonor, or stupidly lucky, to have made it back out alive. Tragically, Daerismun was not so fortunate.": "我只去过一次术士墓穴，那是在我年轻的时候，在我还不懂的时候。我受雇于达里斯蒙-艾拉斯，他是阿维德人之一--烛台镇受人尊敬的学者僧侣--引导他去那里。他正在写一篇关于这个地方的论文，并希望获得关于这个地方的第一手经验。由于我刚从埃弗里斯卡来，我从来没有听说过关于这个地方的智者的警告。我要么是特别喜爱索洛诺，要么是愚蠢地幸运，能活着回来。可悲的是，戴里斯曼就没有这么幸运了。",
	"As we approached, this ruined cityscape seemed uninhabited. Its expanse is fairly limited, and consists almost entirely of a mess of destroyed buildings and massive boulders.": "当我们走近时，这个破败的城市景观似乎无人居住。它的范围相当有限，几乎完全由被摧毁的建筑物和巨大的巨石组成。",
	"The central towers were apparently preserved by some aspect of their magical construction—which isn't to say that they were entirely unaffected by the crash. Upon closer inspection, one of the central towers has a great crack running along its western edge, and several of the others display a degree of damage.": "中央塔楼显然因其魔法结构的某些方面而得以保存--这并不是说它们完全没有受到撞击的影响。经过仔细检查，其中一座中央塔楼的西边有一条巨大的裂缝，其他几座塔楼也有一定程度的损坏。",
	"As we came even closer to the towers, they appeared to be anything but abandoned. In their windows flickered occasional eldritch lights, and on their sides we could see indistinct shapes scampering across the surface. These buildings were crafted to appear as though clad in black mail, made of overlapping plates and slightly discordant, off-center architecture creating the impression of joints that might bend at any moment.": "当我们更接近这些塔楼时，它们似乎并没有被遗弃。在它们的窗户上，偶尔闪烁着长生不老的光芒，在它们的侧面，我们可以看到模糊的形状在表面上窜动。这些建筑被精心打造，仿佛披上了黑色的外衣，由重叠的板块和略微不和谐的、偏离中心的建筑构成，给人以随时可能弯曲的印象。",
	"The towers, joined in a rough circle by walls of smooth black stone, form a perimeter around the heart of the Crypt—which can be seen only from a terrifyingly close vantage. Obscured and protected by the towers are several strange plots of land: some barren, others overrun with twisted, thorny flora not found in nature. Rail-less bridges connect these towers at various points, and all of them spiral around the heart: that which is reputedly the demesne of the lich-king Larloch himself, who has also been called the Shadow King.": "这些塔楼由光滑的黑石墙围成一个粗略的圆圈，围绕着地窖的中心形成了一个周长，只有从一个可怕的近处才能看到它。被塔楼遮蔽和保护的是几块奇怪的土地：有些是荒芜的，有些则是自然界中没有的扭曲、多刺的植物群。无轨桥在不同的地方连接着这些塔楼，所有的塔楼都围绕着中心地带盘旋：据说那是蜥蜴王拉洛克本人的领地，他也被称为影子国王。",
	"I warn you: do not come to this place. And if you must, do not tarry, for its defenders are brutal and bloodthirsty, as inimical to life as any plague or poison, and they take delight in the suffering of those who come into their reach.": "我警告你：不要到这个地方来。如果你一定要来，也不要耽搁，因为它的守卫者残忍而嗜血，像任何瘟疫或毒药一样对生命充满敌意，他们以那些进入他们视野的人的痛苦为乐。",
	"This place is rife with undead, of all varieties. In addition to the Shadow King, the Crypt houses several other liches, undead sorcerous vassals to Larloch. He calls upon their power when he has need, but otherwise leaves them alone to conduct the experiments and plots he demands of them. Though he once bound their influence tightly, reports suggest he has begun giving them a greater lead on their leashes, for magical horrors that could well be the result of their experiments have been seen unleashed in the Troll Hills and Troll Forest around the ruins.": "这个地方充斥着各种各样的亡灵。除了影子国王之外，地窖里还有其他几个地衣，是拉洛克的不死巫师附庸。他在有需要的时候会调用他们的力量，但除此之外，他让他们独自进行他所要求的实验和阴谋。虽然他曾经把他们的影响束缚得很紧，但报告显示他已经开始给他们更多的约束，因为在废墟周围的巨魔山和巨魔森林中，已经看到了很可能是他们实验结果的魔法恐怖。",
	"Such monstrosities are also common prowling the ruins of the Crypt itself. During my brief sojourn into this place, I identified several creatures that likely began their lives as griffons, owlbears, trolls, and even a beholder, but they had become twisted and nearly unrecognizable. What it is these liches do to these creatures is a question for minds far more wise than mine—I know only that the first such abomination I fought nearly killed me, and I barely escaped from the others we sighted.": "这样的怪物在地窖本身的废墟中游荡也很常见。在我进入这个地方的短暂逗留期间，我发现了几个生物，它们开始时可能是狮鹫、猫头鹰熊、巨魔，甚至还有一个看门人，但它们已经变得扭曲，几乎无法辨认。这些地衣对这些生物做了什么，是一个比我聪明得多的问题--我只知道，我与之战斗的第一个这样的憎恶几乎杀死了我，而我勉强从我们看到的其他憎恶中逃脱了。",
	"The Crypt has defenses other than monsters, as well. My companion Daerismun asserted that it was protected with layers of \"spell webs,\" constructions of magical energy waiting to unleash spells against those who stumbled into them. I had the terrible opportunity to see one of them in action, when the Avowed scholar unknowingly breached one of those so-called webs and set off a ball of fire, which ignited with himself at its center.": "地窖除了怪物之外，也有其他防御措施。我的同伴达里斯蒙断言，它被一层层的 \"法术网 \"所保护，这些由魔法能量构成的建筑等待着对那些误入其中的人释放出法术。我曾有过一次可怕的机会看到其中的一个行动，当时阿维德学者在不知情的情况下突破了其中一个所谓的网，引爆了一个火球，火球以他自己为中心点燃了。",
	"As one might imagine, this blast drew the attention of all manner of twisted predators and hungry undead, which came forth to investigate. I don't know how these creatures kept from being caught in these traps, or if they had simply dwelt here long enough to know how to avoid them. Before I could give the matter any thought, I was forced to flee, and I don't intend to ever return.": "可以想象，这次爆炸引起了各种扭曲的掠食者和饥饿的亡灵的注意，它们纷纷出来调查。我不知道这些生物是如何避免陷入这些陷阱的，或者它们是否只是在这里居住了足够长的时间，知道如何避免它们。在我考虑这个问题之前，我被迫逃离，而且我不打算再回来。",
	"Anyone who goes to Luskan should know about its ruling Ships and the Arcane Brotherhood. The Ships of Luskan have been described as bands of pirates, but that characterization misses how deeply ingrained the Ships are to the society of Luskan and the mentality of its citizens. Attack a Ship member and you might incur not just the wrath of the Ship, but of much of the city as well. As for the Arcane Brotherhood, one member of it may or may not come to another's aid, but know that each of these egotistical mages is eager to prove his or her magical prowess, and none can afford to show weakness before the folk of Luskan.": "任何去卢斯坎的人都应该知道它的统治者 \"船 \"和奥术兄弟会。卢斯坎的船队被描述为海盗团伙，但这种描述忽略了船队在卢斯坎社会和市民心态中的根深蒂固。攻击飞船成员，你可能不仅会招致飞船的愤怒，还会招致城市大部分人的愤怒。至于奥术兄弟会，它的一个成员可能会也可能不会来帮助另一个成员，但要知道，这些自负的法师们都渴望证明自己的魔法能力，没有人能够在卢斯坎的民众面前示弱。",
	"Luskan, the City of Sails, spans the icy River Mirar, which tumbles from the Spine of the World, races past Mirabar, and then plunges toward the sea. The swift river has cut deep here, and Luskan rests atop two escarpments on either side, with sheer, forty-foot bluffs of gray stone rising above the water. Around the city's perimeter, thick stone walls with squat towers provide defense. The southern gate, called the Twin Teeth, boasts the most impressive towers, standing twice as tall as the city walls, and bedecked with crenellations and arrow slits enough for numerous defenders, in a show of strength toward the southern approach.": "卢斯坎，风帆之城，横跨冰冷的米拉河，它从世界的脊梁上翻滚而下，经过米拉巴尔，然后向大海急速坠落。湍急的河流在这里留下了深深的痕迹，卢斯坎位于两边的峭壁之上，灰色石头的峭壁高出水面40英尺。在城市的周边，厚厚的石墙和蹲式塔楼提供了防御。南门被称为 \"双牙\"，拥有最令人印象深刻的塔楼，其高度是城墙的两倍，上面布满了石榴裙和箭缝，足以容纳众多的守卫者，以示对南方的实力。",
	"Within the city walls and on the nearby waters, Luskan is ruled by its Ships and their five High Captains:": "在城墙内和附近的水域，卢斯坎由其船舶和五位高级船长统治。",
	"First High Captain Beniago Kurth": "第一高级上尉贝尼亚戈-库尔特",
	"Second High Captain Barri Baram": "二等队长巴里-巴拉姆",
	"Third High Captain Dagmaer Suljack": "第三任高级上尉达格马尔-苏尔杰克",
	"Fifth High Captain Hartouchen Rethnor": "第五任高级上尉哈图森-雷思诺",
	"The five High Captains take the names of their Ships when they ascend to leadership. The captains are the highest authorities in Luskan; they and the members of their Ships conduct themselves as a sort of nobility, albeit one that isn't hereditary.": "五位高级船长在升任领导职务时使用他们的船的名字。船长是卢斯坎的最高权威；他们和他们船上的成员把自己当作一种贵族，尽管不是世袭的。",
	"Despite the name, each Ship is not a single vessel, but an organization of stalwarts owing allegiance to one another and to their captain, whom they elect for life. To be a member of a Ship is a select privilege, one that only one in ten of Luskan's residents can claim.": "尽管有这个名字，但每艘船都不是单一的船只，而是一个中坚力量的组织，他们相互效忠，并对他们的船长终身效忠。成为一艘船的成员是一种特殊的特权，只有十分之一的卢斯坎居民可以拥有这种特权。",
	"The five Ships of Luskan are more than gangs of pirates. They are fellowships of people who live, train, work, make love, and go to war with each other. To join one is a mark of honor and continues a grand tradition that Luskar associate with democracy, self-determination, and individuality.": "卢斯坎的五艘船不仅仅是海盗帮派。它们是由生活、训练、工作、做爱和相互交战的人们组成的团体。加入其中是一种荣誉的标志，并延续了卢斯卡人与民主、自决和个性相关的宏伟传统。",
	"Each Ship has its own symbol and colors. Members of a Ship often wear their colors, decorate their round shields with the symbol and colors, and tattoo themselves with the symbol. Like their Northlander relations, Luskar Ship members regularly tattoo their faces, but instead of representing their island, the tattoos are either personal marks or tattoos of their allegiance to their Ship.": "每艘船都有自己的标志和颜色。一艘船的成员经常穿上他们的颜色，用符号和颜色装饰他们的圆盾，并在自己身上刺上符号。与他们的北地人关系一样，卢斯卡船的成员也经常在脸上纹身，但这些纹身不是代表他们的岛屿，而是个人的标记或对他们船的忠诚的纹身。",
	"Membership in a Ship is voluntary, but once undertaken it is until death. To join a Ship, a Luskar must be of fighting age (fourteen or so, for humans), and possess at least one sword or axe, one spear, and three of the sturdy, bossed shields the Northlanders prefer. Each Ship accepts new candidates from time to time to fill vacancies caused by death, but as a rule, the Ships don't expand their ranks by taking on a large number of new members at one time.": "船只的成员资格是自愿的，但一旦加入就会一直到死。要加入一艘船，卢斯卡人必须达到战斗年龄（对人类来说是14岁左右），并且至少拥有一把剑或斧头、一把长矛和三面北地人喜欢的坚固的带凸缘的盾牌。每艘船不时地接受新的候选人，以填补因死亡造成的空缺，但作为一项规则，船队不会通过一次接受大量的新成员来扩大其队伍。",
	"Each Ship has some number of sailing vessels, the size, crew, and type of which help to determine the influence of the Ship's High Captain and its rank within the city. The current First Ship, Kurth, has so many vessels that it nearly outnumbers the next two Ships combined, and its membership is so numerous that Ships Suljack, Taerl, and Rethnor could merge and still not equal it.": "每艘船都有一定数量的帆船，它们的大小、船员和类型有助于决定该船的高级船长的影响力和它在城市中的地位。目前的第一艘船Kurth拥有如此多的船只，几乎超过了后面两艘船的总和，其成员数量之多，以至于Suljack号、Taerl号和Rethnor号可以合并，但仍然无法与之相比。",
	"The laws of the city govern the behavior of the Ships and their captains, decreeing the Ships responsible for the city's defense, its administration, and the management of its resources. Beyond these universal tasks, each captain takes on other duties as desired in order of that Ship's standing in the hierarchy, leaving less glamorous and less lucrative tasks to the captains and Ships of lower rank.": "城市的法律规定了船舶及其船长的行为，命令船舶负责城市的防御、行政和资源的管理。除了这些普遍的任务外，每个船长根据该船在等级制度中的地位，按需要承担其他职责，把不太光彩和不太有利可图的任务留给低级别的船长和船舶。",
	"Since each of the Ships has the ability to take what it likes and leave what it doesn't want to the lesser Ships, a strict division of duties has arisen among them.": "由于每艘船都有能力拿走它喜欢的东西，而把它不想要的东西留给较小的船，所以它们之间产生了严格的职责分工。",
	"Ship Kurth controls the city's docks and activity occurring thereupon. Among the most profitable of the merchandise that passes through the port are weapons and tools from Ironmaster, and ambergris for the perfume trade.": "库尔特船控制着城市的码头和码头上发生的活动。在通过港口的商品中，最赚钱的是来自铁匠的武器和工具，以及用于香水贸易的龙涎香。",
	"Ship Baram operates Luskan's fishing industry. The food it provides is so vital to the city's welfare nowadays that Baram has risen to Second Ship on the strength of its successful forays out to sea.": "巴拉姆号经营卢斯坎的捕鱼业。它所提供的食物对城市的福利是如此重要，以至于巴拉姆凭借其成功出海的优势上升为第二艘船。",
	"Ship Suljack holds sway over, and conducts most of, the piracy and raiding that originates out of Luskan. It occasionally passes the more meager opportunities down to Taerl.": "Suljack号船掌握着来自卢斯坎的大部分海盗和袭击活动，并进行这些活动。它偶尔会把更少的机会传给泰尔。",
	"Ship Taerl, recently elevated from Fifth Ship, had been accustomed to taking the hindmost. Now its workers and sailors happily accept chances for profit handed down from above, and just as happily delegate the most menial and undesirable chores to Rethnor.": "最近从五号船升上来的泰尔号，已经习惯了吃大亏。现在，它的工人和水手们高兴地接受从上面传下来的获利机会，也同样高兴地把最琐碎和不受欢迎的杂务委托给雷思诺。",
	"Ship Rethnor engages in few worthwhile activities aside from guard duty, which is a poor source of income. Rethnor toughs sometimes roam the streets of Luskan, looking for a quick and perhaps violent way to grab some coin.": "Rethnor船除了警卫任务外，很少从事有价值的活动，这是一个可怜的收入来源。雷斯诺的硬汉们有时会在卢斯坎的街道上游荡，寻找一种快速、也许是暴力的方式来攫取一些钱财。",
	"Without question, the people of Luskan show their Northlander heritage. They raid ships and coastal settlements, engage in interdiction and piracy, and value strength of arms above most other qualities. During Luskan's long history on the Sword Coast, however, the city has adopted many of the attitudes of mainland folk. Luskar don't kidnap people from other settlements or tribes, and they hold that women have social standing equal to men (two of the High Captains, Suljack and Taerl, are women). They don't distrust magic, as their island brethren do. Slavery is, at least nominally, illegal in Luskan, though a slave taken and sold at sea is usually overlooked by authorities.": "毫无疑问，卢斯坎人显示了他们的北地人遗产。他们袭击船只和沿海定居点，从事拦截和海盗活动，并把武器的力量看得高于其他大多数品质。然而，在卢斯坎在剑海岸的漫长历史中，这个城市已经采用了许多大陆人民的态度。卢斯坎人不绑架其他定居点或部落的人，他们认为女性的社会地位与男性相同（两位高级船长，苏杰克和泰尔是女性）。他们并不像他们岛上的兄弟那样不信任魔法。至少在名义上，奴隶制在卢斯坎是非法的，尽管在海上被抓走和出售的奴隶通常会被当局忽视。",
	"The law in Luskan is supposed to be upheld by soldiers of the Ships, who are empowered to arrest criminals and bring them before the Magistrates of the city. In practice, arrests are as often made by mobs, but the result is the same: an appearance before the Magistrates. Each of the five Magistrates is chosen by a High Captain, but need not be a member of that captain's Ship. The Magistrates are, at least officially, neutral. Most citizens have their cases decided by a single one of these judges, but a dispute involving a Ship member is heard by all five.": "卢斯坎的法律应该由军舰士兵来维护，他们有权逮捕罪犯并将他们带到城市的地方法官面前。在实践中，逮捕往往是由暴民进行的，但结果是一样的：在治安法官面前出庭。五个地方法官中的每一个都是由一个高级船长选择的，但不一定是该船长的船的成员。至少在官方看来，裁判官是中立的。大多数公民的案件由这些法官中的一个来决定，但涉及到一个舰艇成员的争端则由所有五个法官审理。",
	"Luskan doesn't officially tax its citizens; the city makes its money through trade, fishing, piracy, and raiding. The defense of the city comes at the expense of the Ships, paid for by the profits of those activities as well as the protection money the Ships extort from businesses and homes to keep the thieves and gangs at bay. Bribery is a common practice, a seemingly accepted means of gaining the favor of one of the High Captains to obtain fishing rights, earning an advantageous decision from the Magistrates, or having a business rival or undesired suitor arrested, accosted, or roughed up.": "卢斯坎没有正式向其公民征税；城市通过贸易、捕鱼、海盗和袭击来赚钱。城市的防御是由船队来承担的，费用来自这些活动的利润以及船队从企业和家庭中勒索的保护费，以防止盗贼和帮派的侵扰。贿赂是一种常见的做法，是一种似乎被接受的手段，可以获得某个高级船长的青睐以获得捕鱼权，从地方官那里获得有利的决定，或者让商业对手或不受欢迎的求婚者被逮捕、被搭讪或被粗暴对待。",
	"Given its status as the harbor that feeds the goods of Mirabar to the Sword Coast, bridging the coast with the utter north, and offers the only convenient crossing of the River Mirar for many miles, Luskan makes considerable coin as a crossroads. Merchants wishing to avoid Luskan can choose to use the Blackford Crossing, some thirty miles upstream, eventually connecting with the Blackford Road on the northern bank, but the savvy know that Luskan's Ships control the cable-guided ferries at the crossing, and demand tolls based on the size and contents of the goods being ferried across. The Blackford Road still bears the ancient marks of the dwarven realm of Gharraghaur, reminding travelers of whose wealth sustains the region.": "鉴于其作为将米拉巴尔的货物输送到剑海岸的港口，连接海岸和北方，并提供米拉河数英里内唯一方便的渡口的地位，卢斯坎作为一个十字路口赚了不少钱。希望避开卢斯坎的商人可以选择使用上游约30英里处的布莱克福德渡口，最终与北岸的布莱克福德路相连，但精明的人知道，卢斯坎的船队控制着渡口的缆绳引导的渡船，并根据渡口货物的大小和内容要求收费。布莱克福德路仍然保留着加拉格豪尔矮人王国的古老标记，提醒旅行者谁的财富支撑着这个地区。",
	"North of the city, the Northern Means heads up toward Icewind Dale. Not many take this route without purpose, but scrimshaw from the dale finds its way into Luskan, where those who would purchase it can do so without going any farther into the frozen terrain.": "在城市的北面，北面的通道向冰风谷进发。没有多少人毫无目的地走这条路，但谷地里的克里姆肖会进入卢斯坎，那些想购买它的人可以在那里购买，而不必再深入冰雪地带。",
	"The north side of the city, known as North Bank, is devoted almost entirely to warehouses, caravan yards, and workspace. It includes the Mirabar Shield, the fortified compound that represents Mirabar's trading interest in Luskan. Mirabar uses it as a base to trade with the Sword Coast and the islands of the Trackless Sea.": "城市的北面，被称为北岸，几乎完全是仓库、商队院子和工作区。它包括米拉巴尔之盾，这个坚固的大院代表了米拉巴尔在卢斯坎的贸易利益。米拉巴尔以它为基地与剑海岸和无轨海的岛屿进行贸易。",
	"The main city stands on the southern side of the River": "主城区矗立在河的南侧。",
	"Mirar. North of Reaver's Run is the Reach, where most of the homes and smaller businesses are located. South of the Run are the slums, the \"bad\" area of town. Near the slums is the Captain's Close, where the residences of High Captains Taerl and Suljack stand, but the area is otherwise quite poor.": "米拉尔。逃亡者之路 \"的北边是 \"边缘地带\"，大多数家庭和小型企业都在这里。跑道以南是贫民窟，是城市的 \"坏 \"区域。靠近贫民窟的地方是 \"船长之家\"，那里有高级船长泰尔（Taerl）和苏杰克（Suljack）的住所，但除此之外，该地区相当贫穷。",
	"Five islands stand in the bay formed by the River Mirar and are claimed by Luskan:": "五个岛屿矗立在米拉河形成的海湾中，由卢斯坎声称拥有。",
	"Blood Island is filled with Ships' soldiers tasked with guarding the city; it holds a guard tower, barracks, an armory, and little else of interest.": "血岛上到处都是负责守卫城市的船队士兵；这里有一座警卫塔、兵营、一个军械库，以及其他一些有趣的东西。",
	"Closeguard Island is the home of High Captain Kurth.": "近卫岛是大队长库尔特的家。",
	"Cutlass Island has two rocky heights split by a pebble-strewn beach. The southern peak is surmounted by the Sea Tower, where Luskan's first pirates built their stronghold, while the northern one is home to the Hosttower of the Arcane and the stables it shares with Ship Kurth.": "弯刀岛有两座岩石高地，被一片铺满卵石的海滩分割开来。南边的山峰上有海塔，卢斯坎的第一批海盗在这里建立了他们的据点，而北边的山峰则是奥术师的主塔和它与库尔兹船共享的马厩的所在地。",
	"Fang Island has no inhabitants, and is named for its propensity for destroying vessels swept down the River Mirar.": "方岛没有居民，因其倾向于摧毁被冲下米拉河的船只而被命名。",
	"Harbor Arm Island is a tall spire sheltering Whitesails Harbor from the worst of the storms and waves that wash in from the south.": "港臂岛是一个高大的尖塔，为白帆港提供庇护，使其免受最严重的风暴和从南方冲来的海浪的影响。",
	"The North and South Banks are spanned by three bridges: the Upstream Span, from the South Bank straight to the North Gate; Dalath's Span, the middle bridge with a name none can place in legend, and Harbor Cross, split between the Short Span that runs from the South Bank to Blood Island, and the Long Span that continues on to North Bank. Only Ship members and those authorized by a High Captain may traverse Harbor Cross.": "南北岸由三座桥横跨：上游桥，从南岸直达北门；达拉斯桥，中间的桥，没有人可以用传说中的名字来命名，而港口十字桥，分为从南岸到血岛的短跨，和继续到北岸的长跨。只有船舶成员和高级船长授权的人可以穿越十字港湾。",
	"Dark Arch connects South Bank with Closeguard Island, and only members of Ship Kurth and the Arcane Brotherhood may cross that span unchallenged. The same is true of Sword Bridge, which crosses from Closeguard Island to Cutlass Island. Although Closeguard Island is officially unguarded, it's still true that only members of the Arcane Brotherhood or Ship Kurth are expected to be there, so anyone out of place is aggressively questioned about their presence.": "黑暗拱门连接着南岸和Closeguard岛，只有库尔兹船和奥术兄弟会的成员可以不受挑战地穿过这个跨度。剑桥也是如此，它从近卫岛横跨到刀剑岛。虽然Closeguard岛在官方上是无人看守的，但仍然是只有奥术兄弟会或库尔特船的成员才会在那里，所以任何不在状态的人都会被积极地询问他们的存在。",
	"In the last decade or so, two great changes have come over Luskan. The first was the plague that crippled the gangs that had controlled the city, allowing the High Captains to reclaim the power they had long held in Luskan. The other, far more sudden, was the return of the Arcane Brotherhood and its five-spired tower. A few years ago, the ruined Hosttower of the Arcane began regenerating its damaged stone, climbing into the sky once more. Shortly thereafter, mages of the Arcane Brotherhood emerged, almost immediately began cleansing the Luskar ruins of undead, and fought off a dragon menacing the city. Cheered by the citizens, they swore to keep themselves out of the politics of the High Captains and the city at large, but the notion that powerful wizards closely aligned with one another can truly remain neutral is laughable to anyone familiar with such things.": "在过去十年左右的时间里，卢斯坎发生了两次巨大的变化。第一场是瘟疫，它削弱了控制城市的帮派，使高级队长们重新获得了他们在卢斯坎长期拥有的权力。另一个更突然，是奥术兄弟会及其五线塔的回归。几年前，废墟上的奥术师主持塔开始再生其损坏的石头，再次爬上天空。此后不久，奥术兄弟会的法师们出现了，几乎立即开始清理卢斯卡废墟上的亡灵，并击退了一条威胁城市的龙。在市民们的欢呼声中，他们发誓不参与大队长和整个城市的政治，但对于熟悉这种事情的人来说，强大的巫师们彼此紧密联系在一起，能够真正保持中立的说法是可笑的。",
	"Now, the Arcane Brotherhood again walks the streets of Luskan, marked by the distinctive colors and patterns of their cloaks. From a distance, these cloaks all bear the same cut and silhouette, but each wizard of the Hosttower chooses a color or a design, and a moniker to match it. The leadership of the Arcane Brotherhood is the archmage and the four overwizards of the other spires of the Hosttower:": "现在，奥术兄弟会再次行走在卢斯坎的街道上，以他们斗篷的独特颜色和图案为标志。从远处看，这些斗篷的剪裁和轮廓都是一样的，但每个主塔的巫师都会选择一种颜色或设计，以及一个与之匹配的名称。奥术兄弟会的领导层是大法师和Hosttower其他尖塔的四位高级巫师。",
	"Cashaan the Red, Archmage Arcane": "红色的卡尚，奥术大法师",
	"Zelenn the White, Overwizard of the West": "泽伦-白，西方的高级魔法师",
	"Jendrick the Blue, Overwizard of the South": "蓝色的詹德利克，南方的超能力者",
	"Teyva the Gray, Overwizard of the East": "灰色的Teyva，东方的高级魔法师",
	"Druette the Raven, Overwizard of the North": "乌鸦德鲁伊特, 北方大巫师",
	"Other notable members of the Brotherhood include Vaelish the Brown and Maccath the Crimson.": "其他著名的兄弟会成员包括棕色的瓦利什和深红色的马卡思。",
	"Go far enough north, and you will come to the mountains rightly called the Spine of the World. Turn west and go toward the Sea of Moving Ice, and you might eventually come upon one of the scattered communities of Icewind Dale. You can also travel up the ever-narrowing road from Luskan called the Northern Means, and eventually come upon the frozen tundra beyond.": "向北走很远，你就会来到被正确称为世界之脊的山脉。向西走，走向移动的冰海，你可能最终会遇到冰风谷的一个分散的社区。你也可以从卢斯坎出发，沿着被称为 \"北方之路 \"的越来越窄的道路前行，最终来到冰冻的苔原上。",
	"Why travel so far? Well, if you're like many who've drifted up there from the south, it is because an easier life doesn't suit you, you're running from something, or you just don't fit in anywhere else.": "为什么要走这么远？好吧，如果你像许多从南方漂流到那里的人一样，那是因为简单的生活不适合你，你在逃避什么，或者你只是不适合其他地方。",
	"Coming up the hard road from the south, the first thing you'll see is Kelvin's Cairn, a great mountain scarred by a crack down its southwestern face. Even in high summer, its peak is capped in snow and ice. In the mountain's southern shadow is Bryn Shander, the largest, most populous, and most fortified of the Ten-Towns of Icewind Dale. Ten-Towns is a grouping of communities clustered around the three lakes of the area: Maer Dualdon, from which the Shaengarne River flows down toward Ironmaster; Lac Dinneshere to the east, whose waters are nearly always cold enough to kill; and Redwaters, named for an old battle between rival fisherfolk that left the waters bloody.": "从南边的硬路走过来，你首先会看到凯尔文山，一座被西南面的裂缝所伤的大山。即使在盛夏，它的山峰也被冰雪所覆盖。在山的南部阴影中是布林-尚德，它是冰风谷十镇中最大、人口最多、最坚固的城镇。十镇是围绕该地区的三个湖泊的社区组合。Maer Dualdon，Shaengarne河从这里流向Ironmaster；东边的Lac Dinneshere，它的水几乎总是冷到可以杀人；Redwaters，因敌对的渔民之间的旧战而得名，使水面上一片血腥。",
	"Ten-Towns thrives on fishing and trade, both endeavors reliant on the knucklehead trout of Icewind Dale's lakes. Without these fish, the people of Ten-Towns would starve, but there would also be little for them to barter or sell. The ivory-like bones of these fish are the basis of the famous scrimshaw that is sold as far south as Calimshan and farther east than I care to consider. The bones are also used to make all manner of small, sturdy tools: fish hooks, arrowheads, sewing needles, buttons, and more. Each town on the lakes has its own fleet of fishing boats, and the towns carefully divide the lakes to protect the population and the delicate balance between the communities.": "十镇以捕鱼和贸易为生，这两项工作都依赖于冰风谷的湖泊中的节节高的鳟鱼。如果没有这些鱼，十镇的人们就会挨饿，但他们也没有什么东西可供交换或出售。这些鱼的象牙一样的骨头是著名的鱼骨制品的基础，这些鱼骨制品被卖到南边的卡里姆山和东边更远的地方，我不愿意考虑。这些骨头还被用来制作各种坚固的小工具：鱼钩、箭头、缝衣针、纽扣等等。湖边的每个城镇都有自己的渔船队，各城镇小心翼翼地划分湖区，以保护人口和社区之间的微妙平衡。",
	"Independent-minded folk who come to Ten-Towns are discouraged from striking out on their own, and when they do, they often fail, either due to the dangers of the waters, being blocked out of the best fishing areas, or simply being refused trade by the scrimshanders, whose wares are expensive. Icewind Dale is a place where cooperation is essential for survival, and ignoring that fact can leave one quite alone in a time of need.": "来到Ten-Towns的有独立思想的人不被鼓励独立行动，当他们这样做的时候，他们往往会失败，要么是由于水域的危险，要么是被阻挡在最好的捕鱼区之外，要么就是被scrimshanders拒绝交易，因为他们的产品很昂贵。冰风谷是一个合作对生存至关重要的地方，忽视这一事实会让人在需要的时候非常孤独。",
	"Where nine of the Ten-Towns survive primarily on fishing, Bryn Shander lives on trade, making it the place to visit when you come here. The walls keep the town safe from barbarians who raid the area and the beasts of the tundra, and the packing in of its people means Bryn Shander is also warmer than the other towns, both literally and in terms of the welcome you receive.": "十大镇中有九个主要靠捕鱼为生，而布林山德则靠贸易为生，因此，当你来到这里时，它是一个值得访问的地方。城墙保证了小镇的安全，使其免受野蛮人和苔原野兽的袭击，而人们的聚集意味着布林山德也比其他小镇更温暖，无论是从字面上还是从你受到的欢迎来看。",
	"I have visited only a few of the other towns, and while they have their quirks and charms, they are mostly what you might expect: fishing villages at the edge of frigid waters in a frozen waste. Certainly, there is trade to be done, coin to be made, and intrigue to be investigated in even in the smallest of these communities (which can number as few as a hundred souls). The only other point of interest is the town of Targos, on Maer Dualdon, which has grown rapidly and is threatening to burst the bounds of its protective wall, and thus has a hum of opportunity about it.": "我只访问了其他几个城镇，虽然它们有其怪癖和魅力，但它们大多是你可能期望的：在冰冻的废物中位于寒冷水域边缘的渔村。当然，即使在这些最小的社区（可能只有一百个人），也有贸易可做，有硬币可赚，有阴谋可查。唯一值得关注的地方是位于Maer Dualdon的Targos镇，该镇发展迅速，有可能冲破其保护墙的界限，因此，它有一种机会。",
	"Ten-Towns isn't the only community in Icewind Dale. Tribes of human barbarians called Reghed also operate in the area. Hunters and raiders who value strength and devotion to their ancestral heroes, they claim a great many heroes among their honored dead, including some who were responsible for the safety of Ten-Towns, Icewind Dale, and beyond. A Reghed camp is made up of a large ring of hide tents, able to be broken down and transported as the Reghed move to keep up with the herds of reindeer they depend on for food and clothing.": "Ten-Towns并不是冰风谷的唯一社区。被称为Reghed的人类野蛮人部落也在这个地区活动。他们是重视力量和对祖先英雄的奉献的猎人和袭击者，他们声称在他们光荣的死者中有许多英雄，包括一些对十镇、冰风谷和其他地方的安全负责的人。瑞格德人的营地是由一大圈兽皮帐篷组成的，能够随着瑞格德人的移动而分解和运输，以跟上他们赖以获得食物和衣服的驯鹿群。",
	"Dwarves still live in the mines of Kelvin's Cairn, but in fewer numbers than they once did, and with less influence than they had on the rest of Icewind Dale a century or two ago. The dwarves here claim their continued allegiance to Clan Battlehammer of Mithral Hall, even though they returned to the colder north when they discovered their ancient home no longer suited them. Bryn Shander serves them as a trading post, allowing them to keep humans and other strangers away from their mines, which are some distance away in the shadow of the Cairn. The dwarves send a representative to the council of speakers that governs Ten-Towns, but have no say in their proceedings except to declare acceptance or refusal of the decisions of the human gathering.": "矮人仍然生活在凯尔文巢穴的矿区，但数量比以前少了，对冰风谷其他地区的影响也比一两个世纪前小了。这里的矮人声称他们继续效忠于米特拉尔厅的战锤氏族，尽管当他们发现他们古老的家园不再适合他们时，他们回到了更寒冷的北方。布林山德是他们的贸易站，使他们能够让人类和其他陌生人远离他们的矿场，这些矿场在凯恩的阴影下有一段距离。矮人派出一名代表参加管理十镇的议事会，但除了宣布接受或拒绝人类集会的决定外，在议事会上没有发言权。",
	"Do you know what it is to be a slave? To feel the crack of a whip, the venom of a drow priestess's snake-headed lash, the weight of a burden you can't possibly lift after so much toil? No, you don't. So close your mouth and open your eyes and ears, and dip your quill.": "你知道做奴隶是什么感觉吗？感受到鞭子的啪啪声，感受到乌鸦女祭司的蛇头鞭子的毒液，感受到在如此劳累之后你不可能提起的重担？不，你不会的。所以，闭上你的嘴，睁开你的眼睛和耳朵，蘸上你的羽毛笔。",
	"Known by many as the Realms Below, the vast, milesdeep network of caverns, caves, and underground waterways called the Underdark is home to many strange creatures and even stranger societies. No one is quite sure the extent of this massive ecosystem, except to say that it reaches at least the breadth of the continent, and that most creatures are fully capable of surviving their entire lives within it, provided they can find enough food and safety to do so. Breathable air is plentiful, and clean water can be found. Beyond that, most surface folk only have the tales of adventurers, the survivors of attacks, and the occasional escaped captive to describe the horrors lurking below the surface.": "被许多人称为 \"地下世界 \"的巨大的、深达数英里的洞穴和地下水道网络被称为 \"地下世界\"，它是许多奇怪的生物和更奇怪的社会的家园。没有人很清楚这个庞大的生态系统的范围，只能说它至少达到了大陆的宽度，而且大多数生物完全有能力在其中生存一辈子，只要它们能找到足够的食物和安全。可呼吸的空气很充足，而且可以找到干净的水。除此之外，大多数地表居民只有冒险家、袭击事件的幸存者和偶尔逃脱的俘虏的故事来描述潜伏在地表之下的恐怖。",
	"What follows are portions of the tale told by Oshgir, a half-orc warrior who was captured by a duergar raiding party, sold to a Zhentarim agent, captured by drow, and then escaped his captivity by killing an overseer and fleeing to Blingdenstone. This account was recorded by a traveling scribe of Deneir named Kimitar Thaeless and submitted to the library at Candlekeep. Most don't believe that a half-orc was quite so eloquent in his telling, and thus contend that the scribe embellished the tale somewhat.": "以下是奥什吉尔讲述的部分故事，他是一名半兽人战士，被杜尔加人的突击队俘虏，卖给了赞塔林人的代理人，被乌鸦俘虏，然后通过杀死一名监工逃到布林登石逃出了囚禁。这段记载是由一位名叫基米塔-塔赫雷斯的德尼尔旅行抄写员记录的，并提交给烛台的图书馆。大多数人都不相信一个半兽人会有这么好的口才，因此认为这个文士在某种程度上美化了这个故事。",
	"It's impossible to describe the shame of a hardened warrior driven to his knees by a half-dozen duergar that have just slain his fellows. Never mind that we were asleep and unarmored at the time, or that I was able to take four of them down before an axe cut the strength from my leg. I was shackled and gagged, my wound wrapped in a bandage tight enough to stop the bleeding and numb my leg, as the gray pests laughed and spouted jokes at me, and then forced me to walk until I lost consciousness. When next I awoke, there was no longer a sky overhead.": "一个坚忍不拔的战士被半打刚刚杀死他的同伴的杜尔加人逼得跪在地上，这种耻辱是无法形容的。别的不说，我们当时正在睡觉，没有盔甲，也别提我在一斧头砍掉我的腿的力量之前，还能把他们中的四个人打倒。我被戴上镣铐，堵上嘴，伤口被绷带紧紧地包住，足以止血，使我的腿麻木，那些灰色的害虫对我大笑，吐出笑话，然后强迫我走路，直到我失去知觉。当我下次醒来时，头顶上已经没有了天空。",
	"After days of walking in the deep, dark places beneath the surface, I was led, in heavy chains, to Gracklstugh, on the shores of the Darklake. I was set to work almost immediately at a forge, to pump bellows, heft ingots, and carry barrels of quenching oil. The place is called the City of Blades, for good reason: the fine steel of the duergar is impressive, considering the quality of the iron they were starting with. Hammering, refining, and careful polishing gave the metal the strength and sleekness necessary, and diligent sharpening added wicked edges to many of the blades I handled.": "在地表下深不见底的地方走了好几天后，我被带着沉重的锁链，来到了黑湖岸边的格拉克尔斯特。我几乎立刻被安排在一个锻造厂工作，负责抽风箱、搬运钢锭，以及运送一桶桶淬火油。这个地方被称为 \"刀锋之城\"，是有原因的：考虑到他们开始使用的铁的质量，duergar的精钢令人印象深刻。锤击、精炼和仔细的抛光使金属具有必要的强度和光滑度，勤奋的磨砺使我处理过的许多刀片都具有邪恶的边缘。",
	"The duergar make their homes mainly beyond a great wall, which I never passed through. To the north, the floor of the cavern that contains the Darklake hovers dangerously low, such that in some places it is barely ten feet above the water's surface. The whole of the great cavern glows, and the continuous flow of hot iron through the city gives the illumination a yellow cast at all times. It is frightening, if you forget where you are. More than that, it is hot.": "杜尔加人主要在一堵大墙之外安家，我从未穿过这堵墙。在北边，包含黑暗湖的洞穴的地面盘旋在危险的低处，在某些地方，它几乎不超过水面的十英尺。整个大洞穴都在发光，热铁在城市中不断流动，使照明始终呈现黄色。如果你忘了你在哪里，那是很可怕的。不仅如此，它还很热。",
	"After a month or so of working under a minor smith, I quarreled with the apprentice set to supervise me, and he dared me to test the strength of his new blade. It broke, as I expected, but did the job well enough. The duergar didn't seem to be angry that the apprentice lay dead at my feet, but it was only a short time thereafter that I was dragged off to the market to be sold. As it happened, a human was in the city on some diplomatic mission. I caught his eye, and he purchased me.": "在一个小铁匠手下工作了一个多月后，我和被安排监督我的学徒吵了起来，他敢于让我测试他的新刀的强度。如我所料，它断了，但工作做得足够好。学徒死在我脚下，杜尔加似乎并不生气，但此后不久，我就被拖到市场上卖掉了。碰巧的是，一个人类在城里执行某种外交任务。我引起了他的注意，他买下了我。",
	"I soon learned that I was not bought entirely for my brute strength, but also for what knowledge I had of the duergar. My new owner was a member of some group he called the Zhentarim, and when I told him all I knew, he offered me my freedom and a place among his agents. Together we would journey to a place called Mantol-Derith, where I would serve as his bodyguard. From there we would go to the surface, and I could remain in his employ if I wished. Freedom and a job? How could I refuse?": "我很快就知道，我被收买并不完全是为了我的蛮力，也是为了我对杜尔加人的了解。我的新主人是一个被称为Zhentarim的组织的成员，当我告诉他我所知道的一切时，他给了我自由，并在他的代理人中给了我一个位置。我们将一起前往一个叫Mantol-Derith的地方，在那里我将担任他的保镖。从那里我们将去到地面，如果我愿意，我可以继续受雇于他。自由和工作？我怎么能拒绝呢？",
	"Mantol-Derith is a hidden place accessed by secret ways. Slaves, such as I had been, are typically not permitted to go there. Once in the cavern, I had to remain near my employer, but by keeping my eyes and ears open, I learned a lot about this place.": "Mantol-Derith是一个通过秘密途径进入的隐秘地方。像我这样的奴隶，通常不被允许去那里。进入洞穴后，我不得不留在雇主身边，但通过睁大眼睛和耳朵，我对这个地方了解了很多。",
	"Mantol-Derith is where duergar, drow, and svirfneblin come to trade with each other and with surface-dwellers interested in conducting business with the deep places. Its location is kept secret—I only know that it is fairly close to the Darklake. The drow sell weapons, armor, magic scrolls and potions, and fine works of art. The duergar trade mainly in fine steel, and demand high prices to do so. Deep gnomes come to market with gems, certain fungi only they are capable of growing, and salt, which much of the Underdark has little ready supply of. The surface folk bring wines, ales, and spirits, cloth, wood, paper, and a great many other goods.": "曼托尔-德里斯是杜尔加人、乌鸦和斯维尔芬布林互相交易的地方，也是有兴趣与深层地方做生意的地表人的地方。它的位置是保密的，我只知道它离黑暗之湖相当近。乌鸦出售武器、盔甲、魔法卷轴和药水，以及精美的艺术品。杜尔加人主要交易精钢，并为此要求高价。深海地精带着宝石、只有他们能够种植的某些真菌和盐来到市场，暗黑世界的大部分地区几乎没有现成的供应。地面人带来了葡萄酒、啤酒和烈酒、布匹、木材、纸张和许多其他商品。",
	"The laws of Mantol-Derith don't seem to care about anything other than commerce. There must be no prohibition on what sorts of creatures can visit here—among other things, I saw a pair of mind flayer envoys doing business in the market. The most serious of crimes are theft, the use of magic to influence negotiations, and the counterfeiting of goods by mundane or magical means. Anyone discovered to be in violation is sentenced on the spot, wrapped in heavy chains, and carted off to be tossed to the bottom of the Darklake.": "曼托尔-德里斯的法律似乎并不关心商业以外的事情。肯定没有禁止什么样的生物可以来这里--除此之外，我还看到了一对在市场上做生意的心魔使节。最严重的罪行是偷窃、使用魔法影响谈判，以及用世俗或魔法手段伪造商品。任何被发现违规的人都会被当场判刑，裹上沉重的锁链，被推到黑暗湖底扔掉。",
	"When my employer's business was concluded, he was true to his word, and we left for the surface. If only the drow with whom he did business were so trustworthy. We were ambushed, he was killed, and I was again put in chains.": "当我的雇主的生意结束后，他忠实于他的承诺，我们离开了地面。如果和他做生意的乌鸦都这么可靠就好了。我们遭到伏击，他被杀，我又被戴上了枷锁。",
	"I eventually got away from the place, but not before I had learned more about Menzoberranzan than any sane person would care to know. Although the life of a slave can be brutally short in the City of Spiders, the drow aren't so extravagant that they do away with every captive they take. At the same time, they are masters of punishment—it is fear of pain, not fear of death, that motivates the slaves of drow. If you're lucky, you'll only feel normal shackles and the occasional whip or light spell-blast. A bit less luck or more malice, and the serpent-headed whips of the priestesses come out.": "我最终离开了那个地方，但在此之前，我对门索伯兰赞的了解比任何正常人都想知道的要多。虽然在蜘蛛之城，奴隶的生命可能会很短暂，但鸦人并没有奢侈到把他们抓到的每个俘虏都杀掉。同时，他们也是惩罚的主人--是对痛苦的恐惧，而不是对死亡的恐惧，激励着乌鸦的奴隶们。如果你幸运的话，你只会感觉到普通的镣铐和偶尔的鞭子或轻度的法术爆炸。运气差一点或恶意多一点，女祭司的蛇头鞭子就会出来。",
	"If you aren't a drow in the City of Spiders, you aren't worth a name. All manner of surface-dwellers—orcs and elves, humans and halflings—are brought here to serve as slaves to the drow in their refuge. The constant fear of punishment, from one's mistress or another, more powerful drow, keeps most slaves obedient, even when they aren't directly supervised.": "如果你不是蜘蛛之城的乌鸦，你就不配拥有一个名字。所有形式的地表居民--兽人和精灵，人类和半身人--都被带到这里，在他们的庇护所里充当鸦人的奴隶。对惩罚的持续恐惧，来自一个人的女主人或另一个更强大的乌鸦，使大多数奴隶保持顺从，即使他们没有被直接监督。",
	"The great cavern of the city is filled with tall spires, and homes both great and small are carved into the stalagmites and stalactites that pierce the darkness. Gentle illumination from magic or glowing fungus decorates some homes and businesses, as well as the mansions of the high houses of the city, eight of which have positioned themselves above all others. While the lesser houses dance and fight and scheme for advantages over each other, they all live under the heel of House Baenre and the Matron Mother, who rules the city in Lolth's name.": "城市的大洞穴里布满了高大的尖顶，大大小小的房屋都被雕刻在刺穿黑暗的石笋和钟乳石上。来自魔法或发光真菌的柔和照明装饰着一些家庭和企业，以及城市中高尚家族的豪宅，其中八个家族将自己定位在所有其他人之上。当那些较小的家族为争夺彼此的优势而跳舞、战斗和策划时，他们都生活在Baenre家族和以Lolth的名义统治城市的母亲大人的控制之下。",
	"On a large plateau high above the cavern floor is Tier Breche, also called the Academy, where the city trains its priestesses, mages, and noble warriors. The city's market is centrally located, and rothé are raised on an isle toward the eastern edge of the city.": "在洞底高处的一个大平台上是Tier Breche，也叫学院，城市在这里训练女祭司、法师和高贵的战士。城市的市场位于中心位置，在城市东部边缘的一个小岛上养着罗瑟。",
	"If you are ever so unfortunate as to be enslaved by the drow of Menzoberranzan, my advice to you is simple and stern: do as you are commanded, avoid insulting their goddess (which means don't even brush off a spider crawling on you), and attempt escape only if you are desperate or sure of your survival. If you are given the proper opportunity, as I was, you might discover that the neck of a drow snaps with surprising ease.": "如果你不幸被孟苏伯兰山的乌鸦奴役，我给你的建议是简单而严厉的：听从命令，避免侮辱他们的女神（这意味着甚至不要刷掉爬在你身上的蜘蛛），只有在你绝望或确信自己能活下来的时候才会尝试逃跑。如果你有适当的机会，就像我一样，你可能会发现，乌鸦的脖子会出乎意料地轻松折断。",
	"Menzoberranzan fills a large vault that was formerly a lair of giant spiders and beholders. The vault is known by its dwarven name, Araurilcaurak (\"Great Pillar Cavern\"), because of Narbondel, the giant rock pillar at the vault's center that joins floor and ceiling. The cavern is roughly shaped like an arrowhead, with the pool of Donigarten at its tip, and stretching two miles across at its widest point. The ceiling rises a thousand feet high, and the floor is studded with stalagmites.": "门索伯兰山（Menzoberranzan）填满了一个大金库，这个金库以前是巨型蜘蛛和观音的巢穴。这个金库被矮人称为Araurilcaurak（\"大柱洞\"），因为金库中心的巨大石柱Narbondel连接着地板和天花板。洞穴的形状大致像一个箭头，顶端是多尼加顿池，最宽的地方有两英里宽。天花板高达一千英尺，地板上布满了石笋。",
	"Two areas rise above the rest of the city: Tier Breche, the side cavern occupied by the Academy where most drow citizens are trained for adulthood; and the larger Qu'ellarz'orl (or House-Loft), a plateau that is home to many of the city's mightiest noble houses, separated from the lower city by a forest of giant mushrooms. From either of these heights, a surveyor can view the city. The view shows rows of spired stone castles, their sculpted highlights lit by the soft, tinted flows of permanent faerie fire lights.": "有两个地区高于城市的其他部分。Tier Breche是学院占据的侧洞，大多数乌鸦公民在这里接受成年训练；以及更大的Qu'ellarz'orl（或称House-Loft），这是一个高原，是城市中许多最强大的贵族家族的所在地，与下层城市被一片巨大的蘑菇森林隔开。从这两个高度中的任何一个，测量员都可以看到这个城市。景观显示了一排排尖顶的石头城堡，它们的雕刻亮点被柔和的、有色的永久性法力火灯流照亮。",
	"One day, well after I had lost count of how many days I'd been a captive, I was in a small outlying cavern with a few other slaves harvesting a mushroom patch. I was given leave to answer nature's call away from the mushrooms, and I lingered long enough in a side tunnel to force my watcher to come and find me. I took the first lash he offered me with his whip, then grabbed the weapon and pulled the skinny fool toward me before he could sound an alarm or get his blade out. It took me but a second to get both hands around his throat. When he lay dead at my feet, I took his sword and ran as fast and far as I could. I knew the gnomish city of Blingdenstone was nearby, and I came upon it eventually, but the journey took days as I wound through convoluted passageways and tried to avoid notice.": "有一天，在我已经记不清楚当了多少天的俘虏之后，我和其他几个奴隶在一个小的外围洞穴里收获了一片蘑菇。我被允许离开蘑菇地去响应大自然的召唤，我在一个侧边的隧道里逗留了很久，迫使我的监视者来找我。我接受了他用鞭子抽打我的第一下，然后抓住武器，在他发出警报或拔出刀子之前，把这个瘦小的傻瓜拉向我。我只花了一秒钟就用双手掐住了他的喉咙。当他死在我的脚下时，我拿着他的剑，尽可能快地跑得更远。我知道地精的城市布林登斯通就在附近，我最终还是找到了它，但由于我绕过了错综复杂的通道，并试图避免被注意到，这段旅程花了好几天。",
	"My initial joy at reaching Blingdenstone was quickly tempered. The deep gnomes don't seem to like visitors they can't recognize or identify, and being a half-orc didn't help matters in the least for me. After dodging arrows loosed from the high walls of the city, I gave up on going through the gate and snuck in through a small cart tunnel, emptying out part of a load of ore to make room for myself.": "我最初到达布林登石的喜悦很快就被抑制住了。深山地精似乎不喜欢他们无法辨认或识别的访客，而作为一个半兽人，对我来说也没有任何帮助。在躲避了从高高的城墙上射出的箭之后，我放弃了穿过城门的念头，从一个小推车通道溜了进去，把一车矿石的一部分倒出来，为自己腾出空间。",
	"I managed to avoid conflict with the guards that discovered me in the cart. When they ordered me to stand, I did so with my weapon held at my side, and I turned to display my back to them. When they saw that it was covered in lashes and the scars of the priestesses' fanged whips, and they realized that my blade was of drow manufacture (though I clearly was not), they were willing to believe my story.": "我设法避免了与发现我在车内的卫兵发生冲突。当他们命令我站起来时，我照做了，我的武器在我身边，我转身向他们展示我的背部。当他们看到我的背上布满了鞭子和女祭司的獠牙鞭子留下的伤痕，并意识到我的刀是鸦人制造的（尽管我显然不是），他们就愿意相信我的故事。",
	"Though the gnomes kept me under watch, I was allowed to regain my strength for a few days, and I saw a bit of their community in the meantime. Once I was inside the city, I could tell that it's not much of a city at all. The svirfneblin all live in close contact with one another, and this togetherness can be disconcerting, especially for someone accustomed to small luxuries like shutters on windows and doors on privies. The homes are all smoothed-over natural stone, with little evidence of hard corners.": "虽然地精们一直在监视我，但我被允许在几天内恢复体力，在此期间我看到了他们社区的一些情况。一旦我进了城，我就知道这根本算不上是一个城市。svirfneblin人都彼此紧密联系，这种团结会让人感到不安，特别是对于一个习惯于窗户上的百叶窗和特权上的门等小奢侈品的人来说。这些房屋都是光滑的天然石材，几乎没有硬角的迹象。",
	"Each industry has a portion of the city to itself: trading, smithing, mining, and the growing of a special fungus crop. Still many of the old tunnels and caverns remain unclaimed and sealed off, whether to guard against invasion or perhaps because of what now dwells there, I don't know.": "每个行业都有属于自己的一部分城市：贸易、铁匠、采矿，以及种植一种特殊的真菌作物。仍然有许多古老的隧道和洞穴无人认领并被封锁，无论是为了防止入侵，还是因为现在居住在那里的东西，我都不知道。",
	"If you're welcomed long enough to the city, you can trade for fine goods and armor here; the gnomes' chain mail and mining picks seem most worth acquiring. Before sending me on my way, the gnomes were kind enough to give me a pick, a dagger, and some of their trillimac, an odd fungus that can be made into something like bread. It's a bit spongy, but it doesn't spoil quickly, and it got me to the surface before I starved to death.": "如果你在这个城市受到足够长的欢迎，你可以在这里换取精美的商品和盔甲；地精的链式邮件和采矿镐似乎最值得购买。在送我上路之前，地精们很友好地给了我一把镐、一把匕首和一些他们的trillimac，一种奇怪的真菌，可以做成类似面包的东西。它有点松软，但不会很快变质，它让我在饿死之前到达地面。",
	"Faerûn is home to many races, some of them immigrants from other worlds who found their way here in ancient times when gates and portals were more plentiful, and easier to traverse. Others are relative newcomers to the world, still finding a place for themselves among the longestablished races. The civilizations of the elder races have declined, while those of the younger races are flourishing and spreading ever outward.": "法鲁恩是许多种族的家园，其中一些是来自其他世界的移民，他们在古代找到了自己的方式，当时大门和传送门更多，也更容易穿越。其他人则是这个世界的相对新成员，仍在历史悠久的种族中寻找自己的位置。老年种族的文明已经衰落，而年轻种族的文明正在蓬勃发展并不断向外扩展。",
	"The character races described in the Player's Handbook are all found in the Realms, along with some subraces unique to Faerûn. Each character race has all the traits of the primary race, as given in the Player's Handbook, plus traits for each subrace that are unique to those individuals. This chapter provides racial traits for a subrace only when they differ from or replace those given in the Player's Handbook. The information in this chapter is specific to the Realms, so if something stated here differs from what's presented in the Player's Handbook, this material takes precedence.": "玩家手册中描述的角色种族都是在王国中发现的，还有一些Faerûn特有的亚种族。每个角色种族都有《玩家手册》中给出的主要种族的所有特征，加上每个亚种族的特征，这些特征是这些人独有的。本章只在亚种族的种族特征不同于或取代《玩家手册》中的特征时提供。本章中的信息是针对王国的，所以如果这里所说的东西与《玩家手册》中的内容不同，则以该材料为准。",
	"The Stout Folk are deliberate and steadfast, with a proud history as great artisans, builders, and warriors. Although the glory of their empires faded long ago, the dwarves still hold to their ancient ways and traditions. They stubbornly defend what remains of their old domains beneath hill and mountain, and some seek to reclaim what they have lost to the depredations of orcs, goblins, and the inexorable march of time.": "坚固的民族是深思熟虑和坚定不移的，有着作为伟大的工匠、建筑家和战士的骄傲历史。虽然他们帝国的荣耀早已消逝，但矮人仍然坚持他们古老的方式和传统。他们顽强地捍卫着山丘和山脉下的旧领地的遗迹，有些人还试图夺回他们在兽人、地精和不可阻挡的时间进程中失去的东西。",
	"According to their own legends, dwarves were formed from iron, mithral, earth, and stone on the Soulforge of Moradin. After the All-Father breathed life into them in the heart of the world, dwarves found their way to the surface and, from there, spread across each continent.": "根据他们自己的传说，矮人是在莫拉丁的灵魂之门上由铁、米塔尔、土和石头形成的。在全能之父在世界的中心为他们注入生命后，矮人找到了他们的方式，并从那里扩散到各个大陆。",
	"Thousands of years of settlement and separation divided the dwarves into distinct subraces: the shield dwarves, most common in the North and the Sword Coast; the gold dwarves of the southern lands; and the gray dwarves, or duergar, of the Underdark.": "几千年的定居和分离将矮人分为不同的亚族：盾牌矮人，在北方和剑海岸最常见；南部土地的黄金矮人；以及地下城的灰色矮人，即duergar，。",
	"The Dwarvish language of Faerûn uses a runic alphabet called Dethek, whose characters are easy to etch into stone and metal, as evidenced by the runestones and way-markers found in ancient dwarven tunnels and mines.": "法鲁恩的矮人语言使用一种名为Dethek的符文字母，其字符很容易刻在石头和金属上，这一点从古代矮人隧道和矿井中发现的符石和路标中可以看出。",
	"All dwarves count their clan heritage as an important part of their lineage and identity. While in some cities a single clan dominates (or is the only one in residence), in other dwarven communities there is a complex relationship between family, clan, and the larger society.": "所有的矮人都把他们的氏族遗产作为他们血统和身份的重要组成部分。虽然在一些城市中，单一氏族占主导地位（或者是唯一的居住地），但在其他矮人社区中，家庭、氏族和更大的社会之间存在着复杂的关系。",
	"Some of the dwarf clans in the North are Arnskull, Battlehammer, Blackbanner, Blackhammer, Bucklebar, Darkfell, Deepaxe, Deepdelve, Eaglecleft, Foehammer, Gallowglar, Hillsafar, Horn, Ironshield, Jundeth, Narlagh, Orothiar, Quarrymaster, Rockfist, Sstar, Stoneshaft, Stoneshield, Stoneshoulder, Trueforger, Watchever, Worldthrone, Wyrmslayer, and Yund.": "北方的一些矮人部族有：安斯库尔（Arnskull）、战锤（Battlehammer）、黑旗（Blackbanner）、黑锤（Blackhammer）、巴克尔巴（Bucklebar）、暗夜（Darkfell）、深海（Deepaxe）、深海（Deepdelve）、鹰爪（Eaglecleft）、佛锤（Foehammer）、加洛格拉（Gallowglar）、希尔斯法（Hillsafar）、角（Horn）、伊伦斯德（Ironshield）、琼德（Jundeth）、那拉格、奥罗蒂亚尔、采石者、岩石之父、星星、石盾、石肩、特罗弗尔、沃切沃、世隆、威尔姆斯勒和尤德。",
	"Some dwarves hail from the family that founded or rules a given clan, and so they use the clan name as their family name. Others are simply \"of\" the clan, but bear the clan name with as much pride as their own surnames.": "有些矮人来自建立或统治某个部族的家族，因此他们将部族的名字作为自己的姓氏。其他矮人只是 \"属于 \"这个部族，但他们对这个部族的名字和自己的姓氏一样感到自豪。",
	"The ancestral home of the shield dwarves is in northern Faerûn, where ancient dwarfholds exist in the North, Damara, Impiltur, Vaasa, the Vast, and the Western Heartlands. The most famous of the old shield dwarf cities is Citadel Adbar, north and east of Silverymoon. Many of these dwarfholds have changed hands over the centuries in a cycle of invasion by enemies, followed by reconquest by the dwarves.": "盾牌矮人的祖籍在法鲁恩北部，那里有古老的矮人家族，分布在北部、达玛拉、英皮尔图尔、瓦萨、广大地区和西部中心地带。古老的盾牌矮人城市中最著名的是银月城的北部和东部的阿德巴城。几个世纪以来，在敌人的入侵和矮人的重新征服的循环中，这些矮人家族中的许多人已经易手。",
	"Living in a near-constant state of war for generations, shield dwarves are a hardy people, slow to trust, with long memories and often an equally long list of grievances against their ancient enemies. The more conservative among them want to maintain the traditions and remaining holdings of their people, isolated from the influence of outsiders and safe from invaders behind thick walls of stone. Shield dwarves of a more adventurous bent are interested in exploring the world and seeing what lies beyond the bounds of their ancient dwarfholds.": "盾牌矮人世代生活在近乎持续的战争状态中，他们是一个坚韧的民族，对信任很迟钝，有很长的记忆，对他们古老的敌人往往有同样长的怨恨。他们中比较保守的人希望保持自己民族的传统和剩余的财产，不受外来者的影响，在厚厚的石墙后面安全地躲避入侵者。具有更多冒险精神的盾牌矮人对探索世界和看到他们古老的矮人家庭边界之外的东西感兴趣。",

	"Shield dwarves are renowned artisans, particularly in metal and stone. They tend to focus more on sturdiness in their craft than on the artistic flourishes and gilding favored by their gold dwarf cousins. Shield dwarf crafters build to last, and each one's signature mark placed upon an enduring masterpiece serves as a way of gaining immortality.": "盾牌矮人是著名的工匠，特别是在金属和石头方面。他们的手艺往往更注重坚固性，而不是金矮人的表亲们所喜欢的艺术装饰和镀金。盾牌矮人的工匠们经久不衰，每个人在持久的杰作上的签名标记都是获得不朽的一种方式。",

	"Significant settlements of gold dwarves exist in the Great Rift, the area surrounding the Dragon Coast, as well as in the Old Empires of eastern Faerûn. Smaller communities are found in the Smoking Mountains, in the Giant's Run Mountains, and the Western Heartlands.": "在大裂谷、巨龙海岸周围地区以及法鲁恩东部的旧帝国都有重要的金矮人定居点。较小的社区存在于烟熏山脉、巨人之路山脉和西部中心地带。",
	"Because they have not endured the same cycle of invasion and displacement, gold dwarves tend to be more optimistic than their shield dwarf cousins, but they're still standoffish and prideful as only a dwarf can be. They believe their race's stable history is the result of their attentiveness to tradition, and have little doubt that the future of the gold dwarves will be just as peaceful, if they remain true to their customs and principles.": "因为没有经历过同样的入侵和流离失所的循环，金矮人往往比他们的盾牌矮人表亲更乐观，但他们仍然像矮人那样冷漠和骄傲。他们相信他们的种族的稳定历史是他们对传统的关注的结果，并且几乎不怀疑金矮人的未来将是一样的和平，如果他们保持他们的习俗和原则。",
	"Gold dwarves have the racial traits of hill dwarves in the Player's Handbook. They are stocky and muscular, averaging about 4 feet tall, with brown skin, black or brown hair, and brown or hazel eyes, with green eyes rare (and considered lucky). Males grow full beards that they keep oiled and well groomed, and both genders wear their hair long and often elaborately braided.": "金色矮人具有《玩家手册》中山地矮人的种族特征。他们身材魁梧，肌肉发达，平均身高约4英尺，棕色皮肤，黑色或棕色头发，棕色或淡褐色眼睛，绿色眼睛很少见（被认为是幸运的）。男性长着满脸的胡须，他们保持着油性和良好的修饰，两种性别都留着长发，并经常精心编织。",
	"Gold dwarves are best known for crafting beautiful objects. According to them, all the natural resources of the world exist for mortals to turn them into objects of great beauty. Gold dwarves don't want the most of everything; they want the best. Their artisans toil over items for years, getting their etchings and fine details just right before being satisfied with their efforts.": "黄金矮人以制作美丽的物品而闻名。根据他们的说法，世界上所有的自然资源都是为了让凡人把它们变成美丽的物品而存在的。黄金矮人并不希望得到最多的东西；他们希望得到最好的。他们的工匠在物品上辛勤劳作数年，使他们的蚀刻和精细的细节恰到好处，然后对他们的努力感到满意。",
	"That deliberate, perfectionist approach is a reflection of gold dwarf culture, in which there is a right and proper way to do everything. Tradition dictates every aspect of a gold dwarf's life, from one's place in society, to prospects for marriage, to what careers are acceptable. Gold dwarves who take up a life of adventuring, away from the clan, rarely forsake their traditions when doing so. Even though they might have to live as outsiders for a time, they hope to ultimately improve their standing in their society.": "这种深思熟虑的完美主义做法是金矮人文化的反映，在这种文化中，做任何事情都有正确和适当的方法。传统决定了金矮人生活的方方面面，从一个人在社会中的地位，到婚姻的前景，再到什么职业可以接受。远离部族，开始冒险生活的金矮人，在这样做的时候很少放弃他们的传统。尽管他们可能不得不在一段时间内作为外人生活，但他们希望最终能提高自己在社会中的地位。",
	"The gray dwarves, or duergar, live deep in the Underdark. After delving deeper than any other dwarves, they were enslaved by mind flayers for eons.

	"Duergar value toil above all else. Showing emotions other than grim determination or wrath is frowned on in their culture, but they can sometimes seem joyful when at work. They have the typical dwarven appreciation for order, tradition, and impeccable craftsmanship, but their goods are purely utilitarian, disdaining aesthetic or artistic value.": "杜尔加人把劳作看得高于一切。在他们的文化中，除了严峻的决心或愤怒之外，表现出其他情绪是不受欢迎的，但他们在工作时有时会显得很快乐。他们有典型的矮人对秩序、传统和无懈可击的工艺的欣赏，但他们的产品是纯粹的功利主义，不屑于审美或艺术价值。",

	"Unlike dwarves, who developed subraces in the world, elves brought their divisions with them, settling into separate kingdoms by type. Beings of immense power, the first elves explored and settled the world, bringing about a golden age of art, magic, and civilization. At the height of their power, the elves performed a High Magic ritual intended to create the ideal homeland. They succeeded, but the spell sundered the land in a terrible cataclysm at the same time that it caused the distant isle of Evermeet to rise from beneath the sea.": "与矮人不同的是，矮人在这个世界上发展了子种族，而精灵则带来了他们的分裂，按类型定居到独立的王国。作为拥有巨大力量的生物，第一批精灵探索并定居在这个世界上，带来了一个艺术、魔法和文明的黄金时代。在他们力量的巅峰时期，精灵们举行了一个高级魔法仪式，旨在创造理想的家园。他们成功了，但这个咒语在一场可怕的大灾难中毁灭了这片土地，同时也导致遥远的埃弗米特岛从海下升起。",

	"Also called silver elves, or Teu'Tel'Quessir, moon elves are more tolerant and adventurous than elves of other sorts. In ancient times, the dissolution of their empires dispersed moon elves among other races, and since then they have traditionally gotten along well with their non-elf neighbors. They mingle with other people while their kin remain in hidden settlements and secluded strongholds.": "月亮精灵也被称为银色精灵，或Teu'Tel'Quessir，与其他种类的精灵相比，月亮精灵更加宽容和富有冒险精神。在古代，他们帝国的解体使月精灵分散在其他种族中，从那时起，他们传统上与非精灵的邻居相处得很好。他们与其他人打成一片，而他们的亲属则留在隐蔽的定居点和僻静的堡垒中。",
	"Moon elves are sometimes seen as frivolous, especially by other elves. But it is the easygoing, fluid nature of their culture, philosophy, and personality that has enabled them to survive and flourish during and after tragic times in elven history. While communities of moon elves can be found in mainland Faerûn, many moon elves live in the settlements of other races, staying for a few seasons or several decades before moving on.": "月亮精灵有时被视为轻浮，尤其是被其他精灵视为轻浮。但正是由于他们的文化、哲学和个性的随和、多变，才使他们在精灵历史上的悲惨时期和之后得以生存和发展。虽然在法鲁恩大陆可以找到月球精灵的社区，但许多月球精灵居住在其他种族的定居点，在迁移前会待上几个季节或几十年。",
	"To a moon elf, home can be among the members of one's family, clan, or other friends and loved ones. Moon elves who temporarily take up residence in or near sun elf communities aren't shy about expressing the opinion that their kin need to be less serious. In turn, the sun elves pretend to be more annoyed by their moon elf neighbors than they truly are, provided that the moon elves' whims and adventuresome urges don't cause serious disruption. Given that the moon elves usually move on before wearing out their welcome, such unrest rarely occurs.": "对月精灵来说，家可以是一个人的家庭成员、部族或其他朋友和亲人之间。暂时居住在太阳精灵社区或附近的月亮精灵并不羞于表达他们的亲属需要不那么严肃的观点。反过来，只要月亮精灵的奇思妙想和冒险的冲动不造成严重的破坏，太阳精灵就会假装对他们的月亮精灵邻居比他们真实的情况更恼火。鉴于月球精灵通常会在耗尽他们的热情之前离开，这种动荡很少发生。",
	"Moon elves have the racial traits of high elves in the Player's Handbook. They have pale skin with a bluish tint. Their hair runs the gamut of human colors, and some moon elves have hair of silvery white or various shades of blue. Their eyes are blue or green and have gold flecks.": "月亮精灵拥有《玩家手册》中高级精灵的种族特征。他们有苍白的皮肤，带有蓝色的色调。他们的头发有人类的各种颜色，有些月精灵的头发是银白色或各种深浅的蓝色。他们的眼睛是蓝色或绿色的，有金色的斑点。",

	"Sun elves, also known as gold elves, or Ar'Tel'Quessir, have a reputation for being arrogant and self-important. Many of them believe they are Corellon's chosen people and that other races—even other elves—are subordinate to them in skill, significance, and sophistication. They claim the title of \"high elves\" with pride, and indeed their race is responsible for great, and sometimes terrible, achievements.": "太阳精灵，也被称为金精灵，或Ar'Tel'Quessir，以傲慢和自视甚高而闻名。他们中的许多人认为自己是科里隆的选民，其他种族--甚至是其他精灵--在技能、意义和成熟度方面都从属于他们。他们自豪地宣称 \"高等精灵 \"的称号，而且他们的种族确实对伟大的，有时是可怕的成就负有责任。",
	"Recalling and emphasizing the glorious aspects of their history, sun elves subscribe to the principle of \"elven excellence\"—no matter how interesting, exceptional, heroic, or noteworthy other races' accomplishments might be, there is an inherent superiority to all things elven. This attitude colors sun elves' relations with other elves, whom they see as diluted or diminished representatives of elven culture. Some sun elves reject this way of thinking, but it is common enough that when most folk of Faerûn see a sun elf, they see arrogance personified. Their haughty attitude can overshadow the fact that most sun elves are also tirelessly compassionate and thoughtful champions of good.": "回顾并强调他们历史上的辉煌，太阳精灵认同 \"精灵卓越 \"的原则--无论其他种族的成就多么有趣、特殊、英勇或值得注意，精灵的一切都有其固有的优越性。这种态度使太阳精灵与其他精灵的关系变得丰富多彩，他们认为其他精灵是被稀释或削弱的精灵文化的代表。有些太阳精灵拒绝这种思维方式，但这很常见，当大多数法鲁恩人看到太阳精灵时，他们看到的是傲慢的化身。他们傲慢的态度会掩盖这样一个事实，即大多数太阳精灵也是不知疲倦地富有同情心和善意的拥护者。",
	"Sun elves have the racial traits of high elves in the Player's Handbook. Sun elves have bronze skin. Their eyes are black, metallic gold, or metallic silver, and their hair is black, metallic copper, or golden blond.": "太阳精灵拥有《玩家手册》中高级精灵的种族特征。太阳精灵拥有青铜色的皮肤。他们的眼睛是黑色、金属金或金属银，头发是黑色、金属铜或金黄色。",
	"Sun elf culture and civilization is highly magical in nature, thanks to the race's many accomplished wizards, sages, and crafters. Not every sun elf is a skilled practitioner of the Art, but each one has at least a bit of inherent magic. Many sun elves mix magic with other art forms, which produces the complex dance of the bladesingers as well as the enchanting music of their bards and the meticulous craftwork of their artisans. Sun elf adventurers often bring a feeling of noblesse oblige to their profession: they venture out into the world to challenge its dangers because someone must, and who could be better suited?": "太阳精灵的文化和文明在本质上是高度神奇的，这要归功于该种族的许多有成就的巫师、贤者和手工艺人。不是每个太阳精灵都是熟练的艺术实践者，但每个人至少都有一点固有的魔法。许多太阳精灵将魔法与其他艺术形式混合在一起，这就产生了刀锋战士的复杂舞蹈，以及他们吟游诗人的迷人音乐和工匠的细致工艺。太阳精灵的冒险者往往给他们的职业带来一种高贵的感觉：他们冒险到世界上挑战它的危险，因为有人必须这样做，而谁能更适合呢？",
	"Also called copper elves, or Sy'Tel'Quessir, wood elves are the most common elves remaining in Faerûn. Their ancestors left behind the strife of the Crown Wars millennia ago to found strongholds and settlements deep in the forests. Today, most wood elves stand guard over the ruins of the past, believing it their duty to preserve their fallen glory as an object lesson of the dangers of hubris.": "木精灵也被称为铜精灵，或Sy'Tel'Quessir，是留在法鲁恩的最常见的精灵。他们的祖先在几千年前留下了王室战争的纷争，在森林深处建立了据点和定居点。今天，大多数木精灵都在过去的废墟上站岗，认为他们有责任保护他们堕落的荣耀，作为傲慢的危险的实物教训。",
	"Wood elves tend to be hardier than other elves, more solid and grounded than their cousins. This attitude is reflected in their culture and traditions; wood elves tend more toward physical pursuits than do other elves, and they view ancient elven history with a more critical eye. To the wood elves, the \"great\" elven kingdoms were responsible for many equally great mistakes. They look upon the Sundering, the Crown Wars, the descent of the drow, and other calamities as the result of acts of arrogance on the part of their ancestors. Living around and amid the reminders of this arrogance, and standing witness to the rise and fall of many elven empires, wood elves see the place of elves in the world differently than moon or sun elves do. Wood elves seek a quiet harmony, not domination, with the wider world.": "木精灵往往比其他精灵更坚韧，比他们的表亲更坚实、更接地气。这种态度反映在他们的文化和传统中；与其他精灵相比，木精灵更倾向于身体上的追求，而且他们用更挑剔的眼光看待古代精灵的历史。对木精灵来说，\"伟大的 \"精灵王国对许多同样伟大的错误负有责任。他们认为分裂、王室战争、乌鸦的降临以及其他灾难都是他们祖先傲慢行为的结果。生活在这种傲慢行为的周围和提醒之中，并见证了许多精灵帝国的兴衰，木精灵看待精灵在世界中的地位与月精灵或日精灵不同。木精灵寻求一种安静的和谐，而不是支配，与更广阔的世界。",
	"Sylvan counterparts of the sun elves and moon elves, wood elves eschew the cities and strongholds of their kin in favor of living close to nature. Wood elves have not claimed a large realm of their own since the kingdom of Eaerlann was destroyed millennia ago. Instead they maintain a number of smaller settlements, the better to keep those communities hidden or protected. Wood elves claim territory in the High Forest, the Great Dale, the Western Heartlands, and beyond. Some wood elves live in other elven communities and territories, where they serve as scouts, rangers, and hunters.": "木精灵是太阳精灵和月亮精灵的对应物，他们避开了城市和亲属的据点，而选择接近自然的生活。自从千年前Eaerlann王国被摧毁后，木精灵就没有拥有过自己的大王国。相反，他们保持着一些较小的定居点，更好地隐藏或保护这些社区。木精灵在高级森林、大峡谷、西部心脏地带和其他地方都有自己的领地。一些木精灵生活在其他精灵社区和领地，他们在那里充当侦察员、护林员和猎人。",
	"Despite seeing themselves as part of the world, wood elves don't commonly emerge from their homes to encounter non-elves. Likewise, in the deep woods and forests of the world, most wood elves don't come across members of other races. Adventurers, diplomats, couriers, and those who pursue similar professions are the exceptions, traveling far outside their sylvan domains and meeting a wide variety of folk.": "尽管将自己视为世界的一部分，木精灵们通常不会从他们的家中出来遇到非精灵。同样地，在世界的深林和森林中，大多数木精灵不会遇到其他种族的成员。冒险家、外交官、信使和那些从事类似职业的人是例外，他们会在他们的森林领域之外旅行，并遇到各种各样的人。",

They have tan or coppery skin, with hair of wood brown, golden blond, black, or a shining metallic copper, and eyes of green, brown, or hazel.": "法鲁恩的木精灵具有《玩家手册》中木精灵的种族特征。他们拥有棕褐色或铜色的皮肤，头发为木棕色、金黄色、黑色或闪亮的金属铜色，眼睛为绿色、棕色或淡褐色。",
	"Skilled naturalists, wood elves often take up professions that allow them to remain close to the wild or to make use of their knowledge of woodcraft, wildlife, and forestry. Wood elves are more than capable in warfare, particularly archery. They are less magically inclined than their cousins, but have their fair share of practitioners of the Art, as well as clerics and many druids.": "熟练的自然主义者，木精灵经常从事一些职业，使他们能够接近野生环境，或者利用他们在木器、野生动物和林业方面的知识。木精灵在战争中更有能力，尤其是射箭。他们的魔法倾向不如他们的表亲，但也有相当份额的魔法从业者，以及牧师和许多德鲁伊。",
	"The drow are descended from the dark elves who retreated into the Underdark after the Crown Wars. They are infamous for their cruelty, evilness, and drive to dominate.": "鸦人是黑暗精灵的后裔，他们在王室战争后退缩到暗黑世界。他们因其残忍、邪恶和统治欲而臭名昭著。",
	"For much of history, many believed that all drow were beings of inherent and irredeemable evil. In truth, most drow do align with evil, engaging in torture, slavery, murder, and other nefarious activities in the name of their demon-goddess. Almost always, dark elves who reject the ways of their people are exiled, or executed for being rebels, heretics, and insurrectionists who have turned against drow culture and the will of Lolth. But the existence of noble and self-sacrificing drow such as Liriel Baenre and Drizzt Do'Urden suggests that the evil of the drow isn't innate and can be overcome. The actions of these few heroic drow have tempered some people's opinions toward the race, although the appearance of a dark elf on the surface remains a rare event and a cause for alarm.": "在历史的大部分时间里，许多人认为所有的乌鸦都是与生俱来的、不可救药的邪恶生物。事实上，大多数乌鸦确实与邪恶结盟，以他们的恶魔女神的名义从事酷刑、奴役、谋杀和其他邪恶的活动。几乎总是这样，拒绝他们民族的方式的黑暗精灵会被流放，或者被处决，因为他们是反叛者、异端和叛乱者，他们反对鸦人文化和洛尔思的意志。但是，高尚的、自我牺牲的乌鸦的存在，如Liriel Baenre和Drizzt Do'Urden，表明乌鸦的邪恶并非与生俱来，可以被克服。这几个英雄般的乌鸦的行动缓和了一些人对这个种族的看法，尽管黑暗精灵出现在地面上仍然是一个罕见的事件，也是一个值得警惕的原因。",
	"Many drow in Faerûn hail from Menzoberranzan, the infamous City of Spiders, or one of the other drow citystates in the Underdark, such as Jhachalkhyn or Ched Nasad. Dark elves encountered on the surface are usually found near entrances to the Underdark, because they are harmed by the light of day, which weakens them and their magic. Drow who become adventurers often do so after fleeing the oppressive, cruel theocracy of the city-states. Most of these individuals live as outcasts and wanderers, though a rare few find new homes with another race or culture.": "法鲁恩的许多乌鸦都来自孟苏伯兰山，臭名昭著的蜘蛛之城，或者暗黑世界的其他乌鸦城邦之一，例如贾查克辛或切德纳萨德。在地面上遇到的黑暗精灵通常是在地下城的入口附近被发现的，因为他们会被白天的光线所伤害，从而削弱了他们和他们的魔法。成为冒险家的乌鸦通常是在逃离了城邦的压迫和残酷的神权之后。这些人中的大多数都以被遗弃者和流浪者的身份生活，不过也有少数人在另一个种族或文化中找到了新家。",

	"Inherent magical abilities and a preference for dark places make drow naturally adept as assassins, thieves, and spies.

Drow exiles tend to follow their own path regardless of gender.": "与生俱来的魔法能力和对黑暗场所的偏爱，使乌鸦天生擅长做刺客、小偷和间谍。传统上，男性鸦人是战士和巫师，而女性鸦人作为战士或洛尔思的女祭司占据领导地位。流亡的鸦人倾向于遵循他们自己的道路，不分性别。",

Ancient conflicts with dragons nearly wiped them out, and today they are rarely, if ever, seen.": "Aril'Tel'Quessir，或称有翼精灵，是最早在法鲁恩定居的人之一。他们因长有羽毛的翅膀和飞行能力而闻名。古代与龙的冲突几乎消灭了他们，如今他们已经很少，甚至从未见过。",
	"The Ly'Tel'Quessir have the ability to polymorph into wolves. Unlike werewolves, lythari don't have a hybrid form and aren't afflicted by a curse.

	"Deep Sashelas is a sea god, lord of the sea elves and of dolphins. Labelas Enoreth is the philosopher god, deity of time and history, whose gift of trance is crucial to elven identity and survival. Rillifane Rallathil is god of the woodlands and the wild places, the father of wood elves and protector of druids. Closely allied with him is Solonor Thelandira, the god of hunting, archery, and woodcraft.": "深海萨谢拉斯是一位海神，是海精灵和海豚的领主。拉巴斯-伊诺雷斯（Labelas Enoreth）是哲学家之神，是时间和历史之神，他的精神恍惚的天赋对精灵的身份和生存至关重要。瑞利凡-拉拉提尔（Rillifane Rallathil）是林地和荒野之神，是木精灵之父和德鲁伊的保护者。与他密切相关的是索洛诺-特兰迪拉，狩猎、射箭和木匠之神。",
	"Of somewhat darker bent, Erevan Ilesere is a deity of mischief, a trickster-god; and Fenmarel Mestarine is the moody and sullen god of outcasts and solitude, who has little to do with the rest of the Seldarine (except for Erevan, who uses Fenmarel as a scapegoat in his plots and pranks). And then there is Shevarash, a god thought of as embittered and obsessive, to whom elves turn when they seek vengeance.": "Erevan Ilesere是一个恶作剧之神，是一个诡计多端的神；Fenmarel Mestarine是一个喜怒无常的被遗弃者和孤独之神，他与Seldarine的其他人没有什么关系（除了Erevan，他把Fenmarel作为他阴谋和恶作剧中的替罪羊）。然后是谢瓦拉什（Shevarash），一个被认为是愤世嫉俗和强迫症的神，当精灵们寻求复仇时就会向他求助。",
	"Many elves worship deities in the Faerûnian pantheon, including Mielikki (and the unicorn goddess Lurue), Silvanus, and Sune. In recent years, some elves have found delight in the worship of Lathander, as well.": "许多精灵崇拜法鲁尼亚万神殿中的神灵，包括米利基（和独角兽女神鲁鲁）、希尔瓦纳斯和苏妮。近年来，一些精灵在对拉坦德的崇拜中也找到了乐趣。",
	"The gods of the drow are fractious and treacherous as their worshipers.": "鸦人的神灵和他们的崇拜者一样，都是多疑和奸诈的。",
	"Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders, reigns supreme as goddess of the drow, ruthlessly eliminating all who would threaten her position. Her priestesses do likewise with the cults of rival gods among their people.": "洛尔思，蜘蛛的恶魔女王，作为乌鸦的女神统治着整个世界，无情地消灭了所有威胁到她地位的人。她的女祭司们也同样对待他们民族中敌对的神的崇拜。",
	"Selvetarm is god of warriors, and therefore patron of male drow, although perhaps not so much as Vhaeraun, the rogue god of thievery and of drow males who rebel against the matriarchy. Kiaransalee, drow goddess of the undead, is served by secretive cults of necromancers. Ghaunadaur, known as That Which Lurks, is a subversive power, the mad god of oozes, rebels, and outcasts, occasionally revered by drow.": "塞尔维塔姆是战士之神，因此也是男性鸦人的守护神，不过也许不如瓦伊伦（Vhaeraun）那么多，瓦伊伦是盗贼之神，也是反叛母权制的男性鸦人的流氓神。Kiaransalee是鸦人的不死之神，由秘密的死灵法师崇拜者服务。Ghaunadaur，被称为 \"潜伏之物\"，是一种颠覆性的力量，是乌鸦、反叛者和被遗弃者的疯狂之神，偶尔也被乌鸦所敬仰。",
	"Some drow exiles have heard the song of Eilistraee, urging them out onto the surface to behold the moon as it rises. The drow goddess of song, beauty, swordwork, hunting, and moonlight, she is the patron of drow who reject the evils of their society, offering them light and hope.": "一些流亡的乌鸦听到了艾利斯特莱的歌声，催促他们到地面上看月亮升起的时候。她是歌声、美貌、剑术、狩猎和月光的乌鸦女神，是拒绝社会罪恶的乌鸦的守护神，为他们提供光明和希望。",
	"Folk think of elves as aloof and graceful, dwarves as fierce and hardy, and of gnomes—if they think of them at all—as clever and shy. Halflings, in contrast, have the reputation of being deft and plucky.": "民间认为精灵是冷漠而优雅的，矮人是凶猛而坚韧的，而地精--如果他们认为它们是聪明而害羞的话。相比之下，半身人有灵巧和勇敢的声誉。",
	"Halflings, or hin as they call themselves, exhibit a natural adroitness that often surprises larger folk. This nimbleness regularly comes in handy when their courage outruns their common sense, and tales about halflings abound with lucky breaks and narrow escapes.": "半身人，或者他们自称的 \"hin\"，表现出一种天生的敏捷性，常常让大人们感到惊讶。当他们的勇气超过他们的常识时，这种敏捷性经常派上用场，关于半身人的故事中充斥着幸运的突破和狭隘的逃亡。",
	"Beyond these typical elements of the halfling character, halflings can be divided into two major subraces. Many aspects of the two groups' cultures make them distinct, but even without such trappings they are distinct due to a divergence in what seems to be a primal drive: to go or to stay. Lightfoot halflings are travelers as a rule, with tongues and hearts as nimble as their feet. Whereas if strongheart halflings are on the move, it always seems driven by a desire to return to home or find and settle in a new one. As the saying goes, \"Lightfoot, light hearted. Strongheart, strong footing.\"": "除了这些半身人性格的典型元素外，半身人还可以分为两个主要的亚族。这两个群体的文化的许多方面使他们截然不同，但即使没有这些特征，他们也是截然不同的，因为他们有一个似乎是原始的驱动力的分歧：去或留。光脚半身人通常是旅行者，他们的舌头和心和他们的脚一样灵活。而如果强心的半身人在移动，似乎总是被返回家园或寻找和定居在一个新的家园的愿望所驱动。俗话说：\"光脚的，心轻的。强心人，脚踏实地。\"",
	"Although there are many halfling communities, particularly in the lands in and around Luiren, halflings frequently fit themselves into dwarven, gnomish, elven, and human societies. Lightfoots breeze into communities as they travel, make friends easily, and then move on as the wind or whimsy takes them. Stronghearts settle in, make themselves at home, and weave themselves so deftly into the fabric of a community that it becomes hard for folk to think of a time without them.": "虽然有许多半身人社区，特别是在Luiren及其周围的土地上，但半身人经常把自己融入矮人、地精、精灵和人类社会。半身人在旅行中轻而易举地进入社区，很容易就能交到朋友，然后随着风或奇思妙想而继续前进。坚强的人定居下来，把自己当做自己的家，并巧妙地把自己编织进社区的结构中，以至于人们很难想到没有他们的日子。",
	"For lightfoot halflings, neither the journey nor the destination matters more; the important thing is to keep moving. The life of a lightfoot is one long exploration with each new horizon, new town, or new face a chance to find something delightful.": "对于轻足半身人来说，旅程和目的地都不重要；重要的是继续前进。光脚族的生活是一次漫长的探索，每一个新的地平线、新的城镇或新的面孔都是发现令人愉快的东西的机会。",
	"Lightfoot halflings typically travel in small bands, using whatever conveyance is convenient but just as easily striking out on foot. Bands consist of loosely related individuals, and when bands meet, membership frequently shifts. Lightfoot halflings typically excel at tasks related to travel—be it navigation, handling pack animals, foraging, sailing, and cartwright work—having tried their hand at all such things before or learned from other lightfoots met during their journeys.": "光脚半身人通常以小队形式旅行，使用任何方便的交通工具，但也很容易步行出去。队伍由关系松散的个人组成，当队伍相遇时，成员经常发生变化。光脚半身人通常擅长与旅行有关的工作--无论是导航、处理驮运的动物、觅食、航行和车夫的工作--他们以前曾尝试过所有这些事情，或者从旅行中遇到的其他光脚人那里学到过。",
	"Lightfoot halflings are highly social, often as curious about other people as they are about what might lie around the next bend. They characteristically possess an easygoing and open attitude, curious about others and willing to share of themselves, which enables them to make friends easily. Their facile friendships and ease with partings can make lightfoot halflings seem disingenuous to others. Lightfoot halflings get stereotyped as flighty, easily distracted, fickle, and unreliable. But their friendships and courtships, if brief, tend to be genuine. The staid and stable life that most other people desire just isn't part of their character.": "光脚半身人有很强的社交能力，他们往往对其他人充满好奇，就像他们对下一个转弯处可能出现的东西一样。他们的特点是拥有一种随和和开放的态度，对他人充满好奇，愿意分享自己，这使他们能够轻易地交到朋友。他们简单的友谊和轻松的离别会使光脚半身人在别人眼里显得不真诚。光脚半身人被刻板地认为是善变的，容易分心的，善变的，不可靠的。但他们的友谊和求爱，即使是短暂的，也往往是真诚的。其他大多数人所向往的呆板和稳定的生活并不是他们性格的一部分。",
	"Lightfoot halflings have all the racial traits of lightfoot halflings in the Player's Handbook. They share the skin, hair, and eye tones of humans, but most lightfoot halflings have hazel or brown eyes and brown hair. Lightfoot halflings don't grow facial hair except that males and females typically grow short sideburns.": "光脚半身人拥有《玩家手册》中光脚半身人的所有种族特征。他们的皮肤、头发和眼睛的色调与人类相同，但大多数轻足半身人有淡褐色或棕色的眼睛和棕色的头发。光脚半身人不长脸部毛发，除了男性和女性通常会长出短鬓角。",
	"Creatures of the earth who love a warm hearth and pleasant company, strongheart halflings are folks of few enemies and many friends. Stronghearts are sometimes referred to fondly by members of other races as \"the good folk,\" for little upsets stronghearts or corrupts their spirit. To many of them, the greatest fear is to live in a world of poor company and mean intent, where one lacks freedom and the comfort of friendship.": "强心半身人是大地的生物，他们喜欢温暖的炉灶和愉快的伙伴，他们的敌人很少，朋友很多。强心人有时会被其他种族的成员亲切地称为 \"善良的人\"，因为没有什么东西能让强心人不高兴或败坏他们的精神。对他们中的许多人来说，最大的恐惧是生活在一个同伴不多、意图卑劣的世界里，在那里缺乏自由和友谊的安慰。",
	"When strongheart halflings settle into a place, they intend to stay. It's not unusual for a dynasty of stronghearts to live in the same place for a few centuries. Strongheart halflings don't develop these homes in seclusion. On the contrary, they do their best to fit into the local community and become an essential part of it. Their viewpoint stresses cooperation above all other traits, and the ability to work well with others is the most valued behavior in their lands.": "当强心半身人定居在一个地方时，他们打算留下来。一个王朝的强心人在同一个地方生活几个世纪是很正常的。强心半身人并不在隐居中发展这些家园。相反，他们竭尽全力融入当地社区，成为社区的重要组成部分。他们的观点强调合作高于所有其他特征，与他人合作的能力是他们土地上最值得重视的行为。",
	"Pushed from their nests, strongheart halflings typically try to have as many comforts of home with them as possible. Non-stronghearts with a more practical bent can find strongheart travel habits maddening, but their lightfoot cousins typically enjoy the novelty of it—so long as the lightfoots don't have to carry any of the baggage.": "强心半身人被从他们的巢穴中推了出来，他们通常会尽可能多地带着家里的舒适物品。非强心者有更多实用的倾向，他们会发现强心者的旅行习惯让人抓狂，但他们的轻足表亲通常喜欢这种新鲜感--只要轻足者不需要携带任何行李。",
	"While often stereotyped as fat and lazy due to their homebound mindset and obsession with fine food, strongheart halfings are typically quite industrious. Nimble hands, their patient mindset, and their emphasis on quality makes them excellent weavers, potters, wood carvers, basket makers, painters, and farmers.": "虽然由于他们居家的心态和对美食的痴迷，常常被定型为肥胖和懒惰，但强心半人通常相当勤奋。敏捷的双手、耐心的心态和对质量的重视使他们成为优秀的织工、陶工、木雕师、篮子制造商、画家和农民。",
	"Strongheart halflings have all the racial traits of stouts in the Player's Handbook. Strongheart halflings are shorter on average than their lightfoot kin, and tend to have rounder faces. They have the skin tones and hair colors of humans, with most having brown hair. Unlike their lightfoot cousins, strongheart halflings often have blond or black hair and blue or green eyes. Males don't grow beards or mustaches, but both males and females can grow sideburns down to mid-cheek, and both genders plait them into long braids.": "强心半身人拥有《玩家手册》中所有的矮人种族特征。强心半身人平均比他们的轻足族矮小，并倾向于有更圆的脸。他们有人类的肤色和头发颜色，大多数人有棕色头发。与他们的轻足族表亲不同，强心半身人通常有金色或黑色的头发和蓝色或绿色的眼睛。男性不留胡须，但男性和女性都可以将鬓角长到脸颊中部，而且男女都可以将其编成长辫子。",
	"Ghostwise halflings trace their ancestry back to a war among halfling tribes that sent their ancestors into flight from Luiren. Ghostwise halflings are the rarest of the hin, found only in the Chondalwood and a few other isolated forests, clustered in tight-knit clans.": "幽灵半身人的祖先可以追溯到半身人部落之间的一场战争，这场战争使他们的祖先逃离了Luiren。鬼智半身人是最稀有的半身人，只在崇道林和其他一些孤立的森林中发现，并聚集在紧密的部族中。",
	"Many ghostwise clans select a natural landmark as the center of their territory, and members carry a piece of that landmark with them at all times. Clan warriors known as nightgliders bond with and ride giant owls as mounts.": "许多鬼智者部族选择一个自然地标作为其领地的中心，其成员在任何时候都带着这个地标的碎片。被称为 \"夜行者 \"的部族战士与巨型猫头鹰结合，并将其作为坐骑骑乘。",
	"Because these folk are clannish and mistrustful of outsiders, ghostwise halfling adventurers are rare. Ask your DM if you can play a member of this subrace, which has the halfling traits in the Player's Handbook, plus the subrace traits below.": "因为这些人是宗族式的，不信任外人，所以有鬼魂的半身人冒险家是很罕见的。问问你的管理员，你是否可以扮演这个亚种的成员，这个亚种具有《玩家手册》中的半身人特征，加上下面的亚种特征。",
	"The hin have a small but intimate pantheon of deities, which are honored primarily at household altars, roadside shrines, and wooded groves.": "印第安人有一个小而亲密的神殿，主要在家庭祭坛、路边的神龛和树林中敬奉。",
	"The hin mother-goddess and the head of the pantheon is Yondalla, the Blessed One, goddess of bounty and fertility, protector of hearth, home, and family. Sheela Peryroyl is the Green Sister of Yondalla. She is a nature goddess, the lady of fields, streams, and the wilds found in shire and glen, and the weather in such places. She is also a goddess of love, song, and dance.": "阴族的母神和万神殿的首领是Yondalla，她是受祝福的人，丰收和生育的女神，炉灶、家和家庭的保护者。希拉-佩雷罗伊尔是永达拉的绿妹妹。她是一位自然女神，是田野、溪流、郡和峡谷中的荒野以及这些地方的天气的女士。她也是爱情、歌曲和舞蹈的女神。",
	"Cyrrollalee is goddess of the hearth and hospitality, as well as of trust and handicrafts. Arvoreen is a defender-god, a watchful protector who sacrifices personal comfort for the safety of others.": "西罗拉里是炉灶和好客的女神，也是信任和手工艺的女神。阿尔沃雷恩是一位捍卫者--神，是一位为了他人的安全而牺牲个人舒适的守望者。",
	"Brandobaris is the trickster-god of thievery and stealth, patron of many halfling adventurers. Urogalan is the silent, melancholy god of the earth and death. Accompanied everywhere by a great dark hound, he is saddened by his duties, and vigilant in ensuring that the dead are respected and protected.": "布兰多巴里斯（Brandobaris）是盗贼和隐形的诡计之神，是许多半身人冒险者的守护者。乌罗格兰是沉默的、忧郁的大地和死亡之神。他由一只巨大的黑暗猎犬陪伴，他对自己的职责感到悲伤，并警惕地确保死者得到尊重和保护。",
	"Many halflings have taken to regular worship of Tymora, seeing her as a helping hand in their fortunes and a patron of the luckiness associated with the hin.": "许多半身人已经开始定期崇拜泰莫拉，把她看作是他们财富的帮手，以及与黑奴有关的幸运的守护者。",
	"Humans dwell in every corner of Toril and encompass a full range of cultures and ethnicities. Along the Sword Coast and across the North, humans are the most pervasive of the races and in many places the most dominant. Their cultural and societal makeup runs the gamut, from the cosmopolitan folk who reside in great cities such as Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep to the barbarians who rage throughout the Savage Frontier.": "人类居住在托里尔的每一个角落，包含了一系列的文化和种族。沿着剑海岸和整个北方，人类是最普遍的种族，在许多地方也是最主要的。他们的文化和社会构成各不相同，从居住在博德之门（Baldur's Gate）和沃特德普（Waterdeep）等大城市的国际大都市居民到在整个野蛮边境肆虐的蛮族。",
	"Humans are famous for their adaptability. No other race lives in so many diverse lands or environments, from lush jungles to burning deserts, from the eternal cold of the Great Glacier to the fertile shores along rivers and seas. Humans find ways to survive and to thrive almost anywhere. In locations where elves and dwarves have withdrawn, humans often move in and build anew alongside or on top of an earlier community.": "人类以其适应性而闻名。没有其他种族能生活在这么多不同的土地或环境中，从郁郁葱葱的丛林到灼热的沙漠，从大冰川的永恒的寒冷到河流和海洋沿岸的肥沃海岸。人类几乎在任何地方都能找到生存和发展的方法。在精灵和矮人已经撤退的地方，人类经常搬进去，在以前的社区旁边或上面重新建造。",
	"It follows, then, that the most common feature of humans is their lack of commonality. This diversity has enabled human civilizations to grow faster than those of other races, making humans one of the dominant races in much of the world today. It has also led to conflicts between communities of humans because of their cultural and political differences. If not for their penchant for infighting, humans would be even more populous and predominant than they already are.": "因此，人类最常见的特征是缺乏共性。这种多样性使人类文明比其他种族的文明发展得更快，使人类成为当今世界大部分地区的主导种族之一。它也导致了人类社区之间的冲突，因为他们的文化和政治差异。如果不是因为他们喜欢内讧，人类会比现在的人口更多，更有优势。",

	"Short in stature with tan skin and dark hair, the Arkaiuns dwell primarily in Dambrath as well as Halruaa and the Shar.

	"Dark-skinned and dark-haired, the Bedine were warriors and nomads in southern Anauroch. Once divided into over a hundred tribes, the clannish Bedine mostly kept to their desert lands and interacted little with outsiders, except for trading. Over the generations, more Bedine have become city dwellers, leaving behind their nomadic ways, and reducing the number of tribes that still espouse their traditional way of life.": "贝迪恩人皮肤黝黑，头发乌黑，是阿瑙罗克南部的战士和游牧民族。氏族式的贝迪恩人曾经分为一百多个部落，除了贸易之外，他们大多保持在自己的沙漠土地上，与外人的交往很少。经过几代人的努力，越来越多的贝迪恩人成为城市居民，抛弃了他们的游牧方式，并减少了仍然拥护其传统生活方式的部落数量。",

This ethnic language is treated as a free additional language for such individuals.": "如果你的地下城管理员允许这个选项，那么任何来自有自己语言的族群的人类都会被假定为知道该语言以及普通话。对于这些人来说，这种民族语言被视为一种免费的附加语言。",
	"The breadth and variety of the human race in Faerûn is never more evident than in the diverse collection of deities that humans worship. The Faerûnian pantheon (detailed in chapter 1) includes gods of every stripe, and a number of deities whose spheres of influence overlap and compete, which seems to be just how humans like it.": "在法鲁恩，人类的广泛性和多样性在人类所崇拜的各种神灵中表现得淋漓尽致。法鲁尼的万神殿（详见第一章）包括各种类型的神，以及一些影响范围重叠和竞争的神，这似乎正是人类喜欢的方式。",
	"Along the Sword Coast, most human communities have temples and shrines tended by priests who are devoted to various Faerûnian gods. In some of these places, the faithful of deities revered by rulers and other powerful individuals play a greater role in local politics than those not so favored. In the extreme, worship that is deemed heretical or dangerous is outlawed—for example, in a region where followers of Shar hold authority and power, the worship of her good twin and nemesis Selûne might be against the law.": "沿着剑海岸，大多数人类社区都有寺庙和神龛，由献给各种法鲁尼神的祭司打理。在一些地方，统治者和其他有权势的人所崇敬的神灵的信徒在当地政治中发挥的作用比那些不受宠的神灵更大。在极端情况下，被认为是异端或危险的崇拜是被禁止的--例如，在一个夏尔的信徒拥有权威和权力的地区，对她的好姐妹和克星塞鲁恩的崇拜可能是违反法律的。",
	"Draconic humanoids from another world, the dragonborn of Faerûn are proud, honorable, and relatively rare. Slaves to dragons on their world of origin, they are now a free people looking for a place and purpose in their new world.": "来自另一个世界的龙人，法鲁恩的龙裔是骄傲的、可敬的、相对罕见的。在他们的原生世界中，他们是龙的奴隶，现在他们是一个自由的民族，在新的世界中寻找自己的位置和目标。",
	"As with all stories of the ancient past, tales of the origins of the dragonborn are hazy and sometimes contradictory. Each reveals something about the dragonborn in its telling, however.": "与所有古老的故事一样，关于龙族起源的故事也是模糊不清的，有时还相互矛盾。然而，每个故事都揭示了一些关于龙族的信息。",
	"One story relates that the dragonborn were shaped by the ancient dragon-god Io at the same time that Io created the dragons. In the beginning of days, Io fused brilliant astral spirits with the unchecked fury of the elements. The greater spirits became dragons—creatures so powerful, proud, and willful that they were lords of the newborn world. The lesser spirits became the dragonborn. Although smaller in stature, they were no less draconic in nature. This tale stresses the close kinship between dragons and dragonborn, while reinforcing the natural order of things—dragons rule and dragonborn serve, at least according to the dragonborn's former masters.": "有一个故事说，龙族是由古代龙神伊欧塑造的，同时伊欧也创造了龙。在开天辟地之初，艾欧将灿烂的星空之灵与不受控制的元素之怒融合在一起。伟大的精神变成了龙--如此强大、骄傲和任性的生物，它们是新生世界的主宰。较小的精神成为龙族。虽然身材较小，但他们在本质上并不逊于龙族。这个故事强调了龙和龙裔之间的密切亲属关系，同时强化了事物的自然秩序--龙的统治和龙裔的服务，至少按照龙裔以前的主人的说法。",
	"Another legend asserts that Io created the dragons at the birth of the world, but dragonborn did not yet exist. Then, during the Dawn War, Io was killed by the primordial known as Erek-Hus, the King of Terror. With a rough-hewn axe of adamantine, the behemoth split Io from head to tail, cleaving the dragon-god into two equal halves, which rose up as new gods—Bahamut and Tiamat. Droplets of Io's blood, spattered across the world, became the first dragonborn. For some who believe it, this origin story supports the view that dragonborn are clearly inferior to the dragons that were made by Io's loving hand, while others emphasize that the dragonborn arose from Io's own blood—just as two draconic deities arose from the god's severed body. So are the dragonborn not, therefore, like the gods themselves?": "另一个传说断言，伊欧在世界诞生时创造了龙，但龙族还不存在。然后，在黎明战争期间，伊欧被称为恐怖之王埃里克-胡斯的原始人所杀。用一把粗糙的金刚斧，这个巨兽将伊欧从头到尾劈开，将龙神劈成两半，这两半作为新的神灵--巴哈姆特和提亚马特而崛起。伊欧的血滴，散落在世界各地，成为第一个龙裔。对于一些相信它的人来说，这个起源故事支持了这样的观点：龙族显然不如伊娥的慈爱之手所制造的龙，而另一些人则强调，龙族产生于伊娥自己的血液--就像两个龙族神灵产生于神的断体一样。那么，龙族是不是因此就像诸神本身一样？",
	"A third origin story posits that dragonborn were the firstborn of the world, created by Io before the existence of other humanoid races, which were pale imitations of dragonborn perfection. Io shaped the dragonborn and fired them with his breath, then spilled his own blood to give them life. The first dragonborn served Io as companions and allies, filling his astral court and singing his praises. The dragons he made only later, at the start of the Dawn War, to serve as engines of destruction. This view of dragonborn history is shared by those who believe that dragonborn are superior to other races and thus should be the masters of dragons and not the other way around.": "第三个起源故事认为，龙裔是世界的长子，在其他人形种族存在之前由伊欧创造，而其他人形种族是龙裔完美的苍白模仿。伊奥塑造了龙裔，用他的呼吸发射了他们，然后洒下自己的血，赋予他们生命。第一批龙族作为同伴和盟友为艾欧服务，充斥着他的星际法庭并为他唱赞歌。他制造的龙只是在后来，即黎明战争开始时，作为毁灭的引擎。这种对龙族历史的看法得到了一些人的认同，他们认为龙族比其他种族优越，因此应该成为龙的主人，而不是相反。",
	"Despite their differing conclusions, a common theme binds all these legends together: the dragonborn owe their existence to Io, the great dragon-god who created all of dragonkind. The dragonborn, all legends agree, are not the creations of Bahamut or Tiamat—and so they have no predetermined side in the conflict between those gods. Every individual dragonborn, regardless of one's particular draconic ancestry, makes a personal choice in matters of ethics and morality.": "尽管结论不同，但一个共同的主题将所有这些传说联系在一起：龙族的存在归功于创造了所有龙族的伟大龙神艾欧。所有的传说都认为，龙族不是巴哈姆特或提亚马特的创造物，因此他们在这些神灵之间的冲突中没有预定的立场。每个龙族人，无论他的龙族祖先如何，都会在伦理和道德问题上做出个人选择。",
	"Dragonborn hail from Abeir, the primordial twin of Toril. On that world most of the dragonborn are slaves to their dragon masters, though many won their freedom and formed nations of free dragonborn. During the Spellplague, the two worlds intersected and one of those free dragonborn nations, Tymanchebar, was transported to Faerûn. It displaced the nation of Unther, and out of the ashes of these two kingdoms, the surviving dragonborn formed Tymanther, a new dragonborn nation in Faerûn.": "龙裔来自托里尔的原始孪生兄弟亚伯尔。在那个世界上，大多数龙族都是他们的龙主的奴隶，尽管许多人赢得了自由，并形成了自由龙族的国家。在法术瘟疫期间，两个世界发生了交集，其中一个自由龙裔国家泰曼彻巴被运到了法鲁恩。它取代了乌瑟国，而从这两个王国的灰烬中，幸存的龙裔形成了泰曼瑟，一个新的龙裔国家在法鲁恩。",
	"For a time, the dragonborn of Tymanther sought to integrate with their new world while maintaining their own traditions and culture. These efforts gave the nation and its people a reputation for being honorable and worthy of respect. Only a few generations later, however, the events of the Sundering returned Unther to Faerûn, and the formerly displaced land sought to reclaim all it had lost to Tymanther. Reeling from this disaster, the remaining dragonborn in Faerûn now find they must work even harder and with fewer resources to find their place among the people the world.": "一段时间以来，泰曼瑟的龙裔在保持自己的传统和文化的同时，也在寻求与他们的新世界融合。这些努力使这个国家和它的人民获得了可敬和值得尊重的声誉。然而，仅仅几代人之后，\"毁灭 \"的事件就将Unther送回了Faerûn，这片曾经流离失所的土地试图夺回它在Tymanther失去的一切。在这场灾难中，法鲁恩残存的龙裔发现他们必须更加努力地工作，用更少的资源在世界人民中找到自己的位置。",
	"Every aspect of dragonborn life is dictated by the race's code of honor and strict adherence to tradition. Dragonborn society is highly ordered, with each member expected to do one's utmost for family and clan. This loyalty and sense of duty sustained the dragonborn during their long history of enslavement and also enabled them to form communities and nations of free dragonborn.": "龙族生活的每一个方面都是由该种族的荣誉准则和对传统的严格遵守所决定的。龙裔社会是高度有序的，每个成员都要为家庭和宗族尽心尽力。这种忠诚和责任感使龙族在长期的奴役历史中得以维持，也使他们能够形成自由龙族的社区和国家。",
	"In dragonborn culture, the family is made up of one's direct relations, while a clan is a collection of families brought together by alliance, intermarriage, or shared history. Although they are rarely forced to choose one over the other, the clan's welfare is more important to most dragonborn than the family's. The promise of honor within the clan drives them to acts of heroism, daring, or excellence, all meant to bring glory to the clan first and the individual second.": "在龙族文化中，家庭是由一个人的直接关系组成的，而宗族则是由联盟、通婚或共同的历史而组成的家庭的集合。虽然他们很少被迫选择一个，但对大多数龙裔来说，家族的福利比家庭的福利更重要。氏族内的荣誉承诺促使他们做出英雄主义、大胆或卓越的行为，所有这些都是为了首先为氏族带来荣耀，其次才是个人。",
	"The aftermath of the Sundering has tested these principles, leaving some clans fractured and decentralized. Some dragonborn in Faerûn seek to recapture the sort of connection they had with a now-lost clan or family by forging new relationships among their non-dragonborn allies and companions.": "毁灭的后果考验了这些原则，使一些部族四分五裂，分化不堪。法鲁恩的一些龙裔试图通过在非龙裔的盟友和同伴之间建立新的关系，来重新找回他们与已经消失的部族或家族的那种联系。",
	"Dragonborn in Faerûn have the racial traits of dragonborn in the Player's Handbook.": "法鲁恩的龙族拥有《玩家手册》中龙族的种族特征。",
	"Their code of honorable behavior and unswerving loyalty serves the dragonborn as a kind of faith, and, according to the traditionalists among them, that outlook is all the religion they need. Because they were forced to worship their draconic masters in times past, dragonborn are generally skeptical about religion, seeing it as a form of servitude. The skeptics believe that no matter how their original god, Io, brought them into being, that ancient deity is either long dead or uncaring about their fate, and the dragon gods that supplanted Io seem primarily interested in amassing soldiers for their ages-old conflict.": "他们光荣的行为准则和坚定不移的忠诚为龙族提供了一种信仰，而且，根据他们中的传统主义者，这种观念就是他们所需要的全部宗教。因为他们在过去的时代被迫崇拜他们的龙人主人，所以龙人一般对宗教持怀疑态度，将其视为一种奴役形式。怀疑论者认为，无论他们最初的神，伊欧，是如何将他们带到世上的，那个古老的神灵要么早已死去，要么对他们的命运毫不关心，而取代伊欧的龙神似乎主要对为他们古老的冲突集结士兵感兴趣。",
	"Still, some dragonborn do hear the call of the gods of Faerûn and choose to serve them, and are as loyal in this faith as they are to any other cause. Bahamut and Tiamat have dragonborn worshipers, and both Torm and Tyr appeal to the dragonborn sense of honor and order. Similarly, Tempus and the Red Knight appeal to the warrior spirit in some dragonborn, and Kelemvor speaks to some of the inevitability of death and the need to live well in one's allotted time. Religious belief is an intensely personal thing the dragonborn who espouse it, some of whom are as devoted to their faith as they are to their family and clan.": "不过，有些龙族确实听到了法鲁恩诸神的召唤，并选择为他们服务，他们对这种信仰的忠诚程度不亚于其他事业。巴哈姆特和提亚马特都有龙裔崇拜者，托尔姆和提尔都吸引着龙裔的荣誉感和秩序感。同样地，坦普斯和红骑士吸引了一些龙裔的战士精神，而凯勒莫则向一些人讲述了死亡的不可避免性以及在规定时间内好好生活的必要性。对于信奉宗教的龙族来说，宗教信仰是一件非常个人化的事情，其中一些人对他们的信仰就像对他们的家庭和家族一样忠诚。",
	"Small of stature and dwelling in the corners of Faerûn away from prying eyes, gnomes are one of the least populous and influential races in the world, called the \"Forgotten Folk\" by some. This appellation doesn't bother the gnomes; they generally prefer their anonymity and the protection it affords them.": "侏儒身材矮小，居住在法鲁恩的角落里，远离窥探的目光，是世界上人口最少、影响最小的种族之一，被一些人称为 \"被遗忘的民族\"。这个称呼并没有困扰地精；他们通常更喜欢自己的匿名性以及这种匿名性给他们带来的保护。",
	"According to legend, the first gnomes in Faerûn sprang from mystic gems buried deep in the earth—an event that accounts for both the gnomes' love of gems and the cozy embrace of their underground warrens. It is said that mystic diamonds became the rock gnomes, emeralds birthed the forest gnomes, and rubies turned into the deep gnomes. Since the time of their creation, gnomes have settled in hidden places away from other races, concerned that their way of life couldn't survive wider exposure.": "根据传说，法鲁恩的第一批地精是从埋藏在地底深处的神秘宝石中诞生的--这一事件说明了地精对宝石的喜爱和他们地下巢穴的舒适拥抱。据说神秘的钻石成为了岩石地精，绿宝石孕育了森林地精，而红宝石则变成了深海地精。自从他们被创造出来后，地精就定居在远离其他种族的隐蔽地方，担心他们的生活方式无法在更大范围内曝光。",
	"Gnomes gladly socialize and work with humans, elves, and dwarves, but they always keep in mind that, as a small and relatively insignificant race, their interests can become secondary even among their allies. Indeed, members of other races sometimes thoughtlessly treat gnomes as second-class citizens, perhaps thinking highly of their gnome friends but rarely giving credit to gnomes as a people. Gnomes are regularly underestimated, and they use that lack of esteem as both a defense and an offense, when need be.": "地精很乐意与人类、精灵和矮人交往和合作，但他们始终牢记，作为一个小而相对微不足道的种族，他们的利益甚至在他们的盟友中也可能成为次要的。事实上，其他种族的成员有时会不假思索地把地精当作二等公民，也许他们对地精的朋友评价很高，但很少对地精这个民族给予肯定。地精经常被低估，在需要的时候，他们把这种不被尊重的态度既作为一种防御，也作为一种攻势。",
	"Like dwarves, gnomes have long battled for territory with kobolds, goblinoids, and orcs, but gnomes and kobolds share a special hatred for each other. Both races believe in a legend that, long ago, the deity Garl Glittergold tricked the kobold god Kurtulmak, collapsing the earth and trapping him in an endless underground maze and earning his everlasting enmity.": "与矮人一样，地精长期以来一直与哥布林、哥布林和兽人争夺领地，但地精和哥布林对彼此有着特殊的憎恨。两个种族都相信一个传说：很久以前，神灵加尔-格莱特金（Garl Glittergold）欺骗了哥布林神库图尔马克（Kurtulmak），使大地崩塌，将他困在一个无尽的地下迷宫中，并赢得了他永远的敌意。",
	"A curious bit of gnomish lore is that the pantheon counts not a single female within its ranks. Legend has it that the mysterious Ladies of the Golden Hills went away together on some task in the most ancient days, and have not yet returned. The stories differ as to the Ladies' task, from seeking to gather examples of all of the beauty and riches of Toril, to a secret plan to thwart the evils of the world using their anonymity as a shield, causing the world to forget even their names and identities for a time. Gnomes who wander far from home are said to have \"gone looking for the Ladies.\"": "地精的一个奇怪的传说是，万神殿的队伍中没有一个女性。传说中，神秘的金山女士们在最古老的日子里一起去执行某种任务，至今还没有回来。关于女士们的任务，故事各不相同，有的寻求收集托里尔所有美丽和财富的例子，有的则是一个秘密计划，利用她们的匿名性作为盾牌挫败世界的邪恶，使世界在一段时间内甚至忘记她们的名字和身份。离家远行的地精据说是 \"去寻找女士\"。",
	"The reclusive forest gnomes live simply in hillside dwellings deep in the woods. A neighbor could live only a few miles from a forest gnome settlement for a lifetime and never know it. In these communities, anonymity and stealth help to ensure protection, peace, and survival. If they are discovered and treated well, forest gnomes make fine neighbors, but they usually avoid contact even with civilizations that seem friendly.": "隐居的森林地精简单地生活在森林深处的山坡上的住宅里。一个邻居可能一辈子都住在离森林地精居住地只有几英里的地方，却从不知道。在这些社区中，匿名和隐蔽性有助于确保保护、和平和生存。如果他们被发现并被善待，森林地精会成为很好的邻居，但他们通常会避免接触，即使是那些看起来很友好的文明。",
	"Forest gnomes use their affinity with small animals and their knack for illusions to help them remain hidden. When necessary, a forest gnome community defends itself with all the resources at its disposal. Many settlements, however, simply vanish if they are discovered, retreating to some uncharted corner of the forest to begin anew.": "森林地精利用他们对小动物的亲和力和他们对幻觉的诀窍来帮助他们保持隐蔽。必要时，森林地精社区会利用其掌握的所有资源进行自卫。然而，许多定居点一旦被发现就会消失，撤退到森林中某个未知的角落，重新开始。",
	"The rare forest gnomes who leave their people to become adventurers often draw upon their closeness to nature and their magical gifts to serve as guides, scouts, or mystics. Living close to nature also makes forest gnomes likely to take up roles as druids, who serve various forest spirits and deities.": "罕见的森林地精离开他们的民族而成为冒险家，往往利用他们对自然的亲近和他们的魔法天赋来担任向导、侦察员或神秘主义者。贴近自然的生活也使森林地精有可能担任德鲁伊的角色，为各种森林精灵和神灵服务。",

	"When most folk on the Sword Coast and in the North talk about gnomes, they mean rock gnomes. Unlike their shy forest cousins, the inquisitive and irrepressible rock gnomes interact regularly with individuals of other races, especially if those individuals have something to teach them. Rock gnomes prefer to live on the edges of other settlements in their own enclaves, though the occasional adventuresome rock gnome takes up residence in a human or dwarven city.": "当剑海岸和北方的大多数人谈起地精时，他们指的是岩石地精。与他们害羞的森林表亲不同，好奇和不可抗拒的岩石地精经常与其他种族的人互动，尤其是当这些人有东西要教他们时。岩石地精更喜欢生活在其他定居点的边缘，在他们自己的飞地里，尽管偶尔会有冒险的岩石地精在人类或矮人的城市中居住。",
	"Rock gnome communities are most common in the Western Heartlands and along the coast of the Shining Sea, but gnome wanderers travel between communities across Faerûn in order to trade with or learn from outsiders, including members of other races.": "岩石地精社区在西部中心地带和光辉之海沿岸最为常见，但地精流浪者在整个Faerûn的社区之间旅行，以便与外来者（包括其他种族的成员）进行交易或向其学习。",
	"Rock gnomes who leave their communities often find work by using their racial aptitudes to their advantage. Their heritage and their interest in precious stones leads many rock gnomes to become skilled gemcutters and jewelers. Rock gnomes also use their affinity with machines to work as tinkers, alchemists, and engineers. In human communities, gnome tutors and sages are popular, since their comparatively long life spans enable them to acquire and pass on knowledge for generations.": "离开自己社区的岩石地精常常通过利用自己的种族能力来找到工作。他们的遗产和对宝石的兴趣使许多岩石地精成为熟练的宝石切割师和珠宝商。岩石地精还利用他们对机器的亲和力，成为工匠、炼金术士和工程师。在人类社区，地精的导师和圣人很受欢迎，因为他们相对较长的寿命使他们能够获得知识并世代相传。",

	"To elves who have an extreme viewpoint on the matter, half-elves are emblematic of the decline of elven civilization, a dilution of the race's heritage and culture that will lead to its eventual dissolution.

	"In the distant past, half-elves were scarce because humans and elves came into contact only infrequently. The ancient elven kingdoms of Cormanthyr and Myth Drannor had significant populations of half-elves. It is only in the past thousand years or so, as the races have intermingled more and more, that the number of halfelves has increased so that they are now found throughout Faerûn.": "在遥远的过去，半精灵是很稀少的，因为人类和精灵的接触并不频繁。古代精灵王国科曼提尔（Cormanthyr）和神话德兰诺（Myth Drannor）有大量的半精灵人口。只是在过去的一千年左右，随着种族之间的交融越来越多，半身人的数量才有所增加，以至于现在整个法鲁恩都能找到他们。",
	"Not surprisingly, half-elves enjoy the company of others of their kind, such that where half-elves congregate, they are likely to be joined by others. Most of the half-elves in the North and along the Sword Coast are of moon elf heritage mixed with Illuskan or Tethyrian blood. In other parts of Faerûn, half-elves have significant communities in the Yuirwood and throughout Aglarond. Aquatic half-elves are found along the coasts, including near Aglarond, the Dragon Coast, Impiltur, Sembia, and the Vilhon Reach. Drow half-elves are most numerous in the nation of Dambrath, which was conquered by the dark elves years ago, and in the Underdark, where House Ousstyl of Menzoberranzan is particularly infamous for having mated with humans.": "毫不奇怪，半精灵喜欢与其他同类相伴，因此在半精灵聚集的地方，他们很可能会有其他人加入。北方和剑海岸一带的大多数半精灵都是月精灵的后代，其中混有伊鲁斯坎（Illuskan）或泰特里亚（Tethyrian）的血统。在法鲁恩的其他地区，半精灵在尤尔林和整个阿格拉隆都有重要的社区。水生半精灵在沿海地区，包括阿格拉隆德附近、龙海岸、因皮尔图尔、森比亚和维尔洪河岸都有发现。鸦人半精灵在多年前被黑暗精灵征服的丹布拉斯（Dambrath）国家和暗黑世界中数量最多，其中孟索伯兰赞（Menzoberranzan）的欧斯提尔家族因与人类交配而特别臭名昭著。",
	"Half-elves are a diverse lot, given the number of combinations of elf subraces and human ethnicities in their ranks. Most of them consider their dual nature a blessing more than a disadvantage, because it gives them a set of capabilities and a perspective on the world that full-blooded humans and elves can't hope to match.": "半精灵是一个多样化的群体，因为他们的队伍中有很多精灵亚族和人类种族的组合。他们中的大多数人认为他们的双重性是一种祝福，而不是缺点，因为这给了他们一系列的能力和对世界的看法，是全血统的人类和精灵所不能比拟的。",
	"At the same time, the mixed heritage of half-elves dictates that they make an effort to fit in with humans or elves when possible. For instance, half-elves born and raised in human settlements tend to have human names, while half-elves in elven communities generally have elven names. In some places half-elf children are named according to the \"other\" parent, or with a mix of human and elven names, as a way of setting half-elves apart from the rest of their community.": "同时，半精灵的混合遗产决定了他们在可能的情况下要努力融入人类或精灵。例如，在人类居住区出生和长大的半精灵往往有人类的名字，而在精灵社区的半精灵一般有精灵的名字。在一些地方，半精灵的孩子根据父母的 \"另一方 \"来命名，或者混合使用人类和精灵的名字，以此来将半精灵与社区的其他成员区分开。",
	"Half-elves speak both Common and Elvish. In addition, half-elves from the Yuirwood commonly speak Aglarondan.": "半精灵会说普通话和精灵语。此外，来自Yuirwood的半精灵通常说Aglarondan语。",
	"Half-elves in Faerûn have the racial traits of half-elves in the Player's Handbook, although some variations are possible; see the \"Half-Elf Variants\" sidebar.": "法鲁恩的半精灵具有《玩家手册》中半精灵的种族特征，但也有可能出现一些变化；见 \"半精灵变体 \"侧边栏。",
	"There are no half-elven gods, so half-elves follow elven or human deities of their choosing—although just as many religious half-elves believe that their gods choose them. Half-elves often revere the gods of the culture in which they were raised, although some rebel against their upbringing, seeking out the gods of the other aspect of their heritage, or feeling a calling or need to do so.": "没有半精灵之神，所以半精灵遵循他们选择的精灵或人类神灵--尽管同样有许多虔诚的半精灵相信是他们的神灵选择了他们。半精灵通常崇尚他们成长的文化中的神灵，尽管有些人反抗他们的教养，寻求他们遗产的另一面的神灵，或者感到有一种召唤或需要这样做。",
	"As with any people, half-elves often choose a favored deity based on their calling or profession: Corellon Larethian, Azuth, or Mystra for wizards, Solonor Thelandira or Mielikki for rangers, Milil or Corellon for poets and bards, and so forth.": "与其他民族一样，半精灵经常根据他们的使命或职业选择一个受宠的神灵。Corellon Larethian、Azuth或Mystra代表巫师，Solonor Thelandira或Mielikki代表游侠，Milil或Corellon代表诗人和吟游诗人，等等。",
	"Many half-elves worship Sune or Hanali Celanil in appreciation for the love their parents felt for one another, and the two goddesses are seen as boon companions. Some half-elves are drawn to outsiders such as Auril, Eldath, Erevan Ilesere, and Ilmater, or to nature gods like Mielikki, Rillifane Rallathil, and Silvanus. Halfelves from Aglarond often choose Chauntea, Selûne, or one of the Seldarine as their patron.": "许多半精灵崇拜苏妮或哈纳利-塞拉尼尔，以感谢他们的父母对彼此的爱，这两位女神被看作是恩赐的伴侣。一些半身人被外来者吸引，如奥里尔、艾尔达斯、埃里温-伊莱塞勒和伊尔马特，或自然神，如米利克基、里利凡-拉拉蒂尔和希尔瓦努斯。来自阿格拉隆的半身人通常选择Chauntea、Selûne或Seldarine之一作为他们的守护神。",
	"Some half-elves in Faerûn have a racial trait in place of the Skill Versatility trait. If your DM allows it, your half-elf character can forgo Skill Versatility and instead take a trait based on your elf parentage:": "法鲁恩的一些半精灵有一个种族特质来代替技能通用性特质。如果你的管理员允许，你的半精灵角色可以放弃技能多面性，而根据你的精灵血统采取一种特性。",
	"Half-orcs have existed in the world since before the dawn of recorded history, when orcs and humans first came into contact. Yet, in all that time, they have found few places for themselves in Faerûnian civilization—or, perhaps more accurately, civilization has never made room for them.": "半兽人在有历史记载的黎明之前就已经存在于这个世界上，当时兽人和人类第一次接触。然而，在所有这些时间里，他们在法鲁尼亚文明中几乎没有找到自己的位置，或者，也许更准确地说，文明从来没有为他们留出空间。",
	"Most of the common folk have an aversion to half-orcs based largely on their appearance: anyone who looks that much like an orc, they reason, must be like an orc and should be kept at a distance. Because half-orcs are typically stronger and hardier than their human peers, they can find employment in towns and cities, but their appearance marks them as outsiders . In response to being ostracized, half-orcs either embrace their otherness and take pride in their physical superiority, pull back and try not to draw too much attention to themselves, or give up trying to fit in anywhere and adopt a nomadic lifestyle.": "大多数普通人对半兽人的厌恶主要是基于他们的外表：他们的理由是，任何看起来那么像兽人的人，一定是像兽人，应该保持距离。由于半兽人通常比他们的人类同龄人更强壮、更耐劳，他们可以在城镇中找到工作，但他们的外表使他们成为外来者。作为对被排斥的回应，半兽人要么拥抱他们的异类，为他们的身体优势感到自豪；要么退缩，尽量不引起别人的注意；要么放弃尝试融入任何地方，采取游牧的生活方式。",
	"Half-orcs in Faerûn have the racial traits of half-orcs in the Player's Handbook. They speak both Common and Orc. The rare written examples of the Orc language use the Dethek alphabet.": "法鲁恩的半兽人拥有《玩家手册》中半兽人的种族特征。他们说普通话和兽人语。罕见的半兽人语言的书面例子使用Dethek字母。",
	"Half-orcs ultimately owe their plight to the deity Gruumsh, the creator of the orcs. Legend has it that when Gruumsh discovered all the territories of the world had been claimed by other races, he swore the orcs would avenge themselves by taking what they wanted by force. The great orc hordes continue to do just that today, appearing periodically from out of the wilderness to raid and scavenge.": "半兽人的困境最终归功于兽人的创造者格鲁姆什神。传说中，当格鲁姆什发现世界上所有的领土都被其他种族占有时，他发誓兽人将通过武力夺取他们想要的东西来为自己复仇。伟大的兽人群至今仍在这样做，定期从荒野中出现，进行突袭和搜刮。",
	"As a result, the word \"orc\" has no pleasant connotation in the minds of other Faerûnians. At the same time, the word \"half\" is a mark of derision among orcs. Some half-orcs raised among orcs react to this stigma by being more brutal than others of their tribe, which can put them in roles of leadership, but outsider half-orcs aren't welcomed into orc society because they aren't of pure orc blood. And they aren't accepted into other societies because of their orc heritage.": "因此，\"兽人 \"这个词在其他法鲁尼人的心目中没有令人愉快的内涵。同时，\"半兽人 \"这个词在兽人中也是一种嘲笑的标志。一些在兽人中长大的半兽人对这种耻辱的反应是比他们部落的其他人更残忍，这可以让他们担任领导角色，但外来的半兽人不被兽人社会欢迎，因为他们不是纯正的兽人血统。而他们也因为自己的兽人血统而不被其他社会所接受。",
	"Half-orcs are seen as off-putting and intimidating by other people, which is both a blessing and a curse, because while they are often left alone by those who fear them, they also become targets of discrimination, or outright attacks, from those who feel threatened by them. This prejudice against the race makes half-orcs slow to trust even those who show them courtesy—because they all have stories of when they were tricked by such behavior. Their orc blood—the Mark of Gruumsh—makes them quick to anger and inclined to lash out at those who treat them unfairly.": "半兽人被其他人视为令人反感和畏惧，这既是一种祝福，也是一种诅咒，因为虽然他们经常被那些害怕他们的人抛弃，但他们也成为那些感到受到威胁的人的歧视或直接攻击的目标。这种对种族的偏见使得半兽人即使对那些对他们表示礼貌的人也不信任，因为他们都有被这种行为欺骗的故事。他们的兽人血统--格鲁姆什的印记--使他们很快就会发怒，并倾向于对那些不公平对待他们的人发火。",
	"Having grown up among orcs or under the shadow of their heritage, half-orcs rarely have experience with pleasant society, and they often come off as coarse, blunt, or rude in dealings with other people. With the directness of an orc, they speak their minds with no apparent concern for how their opinions are received. No matter where they live, half-orcs usually find themselves defined by others in terms of their usefulness as heavy laborers and soldiers. It is the rare and fortunate few who are judged by their character and their deeds rather than their ancestry.": "半兽人在兽人中或在其遗产的阴影下长大，很少有愉快的社会经验，他们在与其他人打交道时常常表现得粗鲁、直率或粗暴。他们以兽人的直率，说出自己的想法，并不关心自己的意见如何被接受。无论他们住在哪里，半兽人通常会发现自己被别人定义为重体力劳动者和士兵的有用性。只有极少数幸运的人是以他们的性格和行为而不是他们的祖先来判断的。",
	"In lands far from the Sword Coast, such as Thesk and Chessenta, there are large communities of half-orcs, where generations of them have lived as a people in their own right. Yet there are few such places in the North. A small community was growing near the Kingdom of Many Arrows, but the recent war with the orcs of that realm caused this burgeoning population to disperse.": "在远离剑海岸的地方，例如塞斯克和切森塔，有大型的半兽人社区，他们几代人都以自己的身份生活在那里。然而在北方，这样的地方很少。在多箭王国附近有一个小社区正在成长，但最近与该王国的兽人发生的战争导致这个蓬勃发展的人口散去了。",
	"Today no civilized place in the North has a significant population of half-orcs, although at least a few of them reside in or on the outskirts of any stable community. Ironically, it is among the largest and most civilized of these places that half-orcs are likely to find acceptance—in the great cities where people are often more cosmopolitan in their outlook.": "今天，北方没有一个文明的地方有大量的半兽人人口，尽管至少有几个半兽人居住在任何稳定的社区内或郊区。具有讽刺意味的是，在这些地方中最大和最文明的地方，半兽人有可能找到被接受的机会--在大城市里，人们的观念往往更加国际化。",
	"In Waterdeep, for instance, half-orcs make up a tiny percentage of the population, yet even at that they still number in the hundreds. Half-orcs who call Waterdeep home appreciate the acceptance, or at least tolerance, they receive in the city, whether they were born there, arrived overland from elsewhere on the continent, or entered the city by way of ships bringing trade.": "例如，在沃特德普，半兽人只占人口的一小部分，但即使如此，他们仍然有数百人。以沃特德普为家的半兽人很欣赏他们在这个城市里得到的接纳，或者至少是宽容，不管他们是在那里出生的，还是从大陆其他地方从陆路来的，或者是通过贸易的船只进入这个城市。",
	"As befits their dual nature, many half-orcs revere deities from both the human and the orc pantheons. Alone or among themselves, half-orcs offer prayers to orc deities, particularly Ilneval, who is thought of as a patron of half-orcs and other orc crossbreeds.": "与他们的双重性质相称，许多半兽人同时崇敬人类和兽人神殿的神灵。半兽人独自或在他们之间向兽人神灵祈祷，特别是伊尔内瓦尔，他被认为是半兽人和其他兽人杂交品种的守护神。",
	"Half-orcs trying to fit in with human society often adopt a human deity out of expediency (though rarely just for the sake of appearances). They favor Faerûnian deities of war and trickery, such as Bane, Mask, and Tempus.": "试图融入人类社会的半兽人常常出于权宜之计而采用人类的神灵（尽管很少只是为了表现自己）。他们偏爱法鲁尼的战争和诡计之神，如班恩（Bane）、面具（Mask）和天普（Tempus）。",
	"The orc pantheon, known as the Tribe of He Who Watches, is a group of brutal and cruel gods, dominated by their father and chieftain, Gruumsh One-Eye. This god of conquest, strength, and survival is the hated rival of the elven deity Corellon Larethian. It is said that Gruumsh owes the loss of his eye to Corellon's aim with an arrow.": "兽人万神殿，被称为 \"观察者部落\"，是一群残忍的神，由他们的父亲和酋长格鲁姆什-独眼主宰。这位征服、力量和生存之神是精灵族神祗科雷隆-拉雷西安的憎恨对手。据说格鲁姆什的眼睛是由于科里隆用箭瞄准而失去的。",
	"The mother-deity of the orcs is Luthic, mate of Gruumsh, and the goddess of fecundity, caverns, and witchery.": "兽人的母神是卢斯克，是格鲁姆什的配偶，也是生育、洞穴和巫术的女神。",
	"Bahgtru, the son of Gruumsh, is the god of pure, brute strength, renowned for his power but disdained by some for his oafishness.": "Bahgtru是格鲁姆什的儿子，是纯粹的蛮力之神，因其力量而闻名，但因其笨拙而被一些人所不屑。",
	"The patron deity of half-orcs is the war god Ilneval. He has the title of War Master in the pantheon, revered by those who believe in the wisdom of attacking with overwhelming numbers.": "半兽人的守护神是战神伊尔内瓦尔。他在万神殿中拥有战争大师的称号，受到那些相信以压倒性的数量进行攻击的智慧的人的敬仰。",
	"The two most sinister members of the orc pantheon lie at opposite ends of the visual spectrum. One is Shargaas, the Night Lord, god of darkness, night, and stealth. The other is Yurtrus the White-Handed, Lord of Maggots, the fearsome deity of plagues and death.": "兽人神殿中最邪恶的两个成员位于视觉光谱的两端。一个是夜神沙迦斯（Shargaas），他是黑暗、黑夜和隐秘之神。另一个是白手尤特鲁斯（Yurtrus the White-Handed），蛆虫之神，可怕的瘟疫和死亡之神。",
	"Humans with the blood of fiends, most tieflings in Faerûn share a common connection due to the machinations of the archdevil Asmodeus a century ago.": "拥有恶魔之血的人类，由于一个世纪前大恶魔阿斯莫德的阴谋，法鲁恩的大多数铁弗林都有一个共同的联系。",
	"During the Spellplague, Asmodeus consumed the divine spark of Azuth and thereby achieved godhood. Subsequently, Asmodeus and a coven of warlocks, the Toril Thirteen, performed a rite wherein the archdevil claimed all tieflings in the world as his own, cursing them to bear \"the blood of Asmodeus.\" This act marked all tieflings as \"descendants\" of the Lord of the Nine Hells, regardless of their true heritage, and changed them into creatures that resembled their supposed progenitor. The other folk of Faerûn, unnerved by the appearance of these devil-beings, became suspicious of all tieflings and occasionally hostile to them.": "在法术瘟疫期间，阿斯莫德吞噬了阿苏斯的神性火花，从而获得了神性。随后，阿斯莫德和一个术士团--托里尔十三人--举行了一个仪式，大恶魔将世界上所有的盗贼视为己有，诅咒他们流着 \"阿斯莫德的血\"。这一行为将所有盗贼标记为九层地狱之主的 \"后裔\"，而不管他们的真实遗产如何，并将他们改变为与他们所谓的祖先相似的生物。法鲁恩的其他居民因这些恶魔的出现而感到不安，开始怀疑所有的铁皮人，偶尔也会对他们产生敌意。",
	"In spite of what some people believe, however, Asmodeus exerts no power over his \"children,\" and tieflings today are as free-willed—and willful—as they ever have been. Some do choose to serve the Lord of the Nine Hells and his schemes, while others align themselves with different fiendish factions, or none at all, doing their best to stay out of infernal politics.": "尽管有些人认为，阿斯莫德对他的 \"孩子们 \"没有任何权力，今天的铁皮人就像他们以前一样，意志自由而又任性。有些人选择为九层地狱之主和他的计划服务，而其他人则与不同的恶魔派别结盟，或者根本不结盟，尽最大努力不参与地狱政治。",
	"Since the ritual that spread the curse of Asmodeus a century ago, tieflings have been born on Faerûn that belong to other infernal bloodlines, but those that bear the mark of the archdevil (and their descendants) remain the most numerous examples of their kind by far.": "自从一个世纪前传播阿斯莫德的诅咒的仪式之后，法鲁恩上已经诞生了属于其他地狱血统的铁皮人，但那些带有大恶魔印记的铁皮人（以及他们的后代）仍然是迄今为止他们这种人中最多的例子。",
	"Tieflings in Faerûn generally have the racial traits of tieflings in the Player's Handbook, except that those not descended from Asmodeus might exhibit different qualities; see the \"Tiefling Variants\" sidebar.": "法鲁恩的盗贼通常具有《玩家手册》中盗贼的种族特征，只是那些不是阿斯莫德的后裔可能会表现出不同的特质；见 \"盗贼变种 \"侧边栏。",
	"As offspring of the infernal, tieflings call no place in Faerûn their own, although some places and nations are more tolerant of them than most.": "作为地狱的后代，铁弗林在法鲁恩没有一个地方是自己的，尽管有些地方和国家对他们比大多数人更宽容。",
	"In the North, the largest population of tieflings is found in Neverwinter. Since the Ashmadai, a violent cult dedicated to Asmodeus, is also active in the city, mistrust of tieflings isn't unusual even here, since folk never know if a tiefling is a member of the Ashmadai or was drawn to Neverwinter by the opportunity to blend in that a metropolis provides.": "在北方，最大的铁弗林人口是在永夜城。由于Ashmadai，一个献给Asmodeus的暴力邪教，也活跃在这个城市，即使在这里，对铁皮人的不信任也并不罕见，因为人们永远不知道一个铁皮人是Ashmadai的成员，还是被大都市提供的混入机会吸引到永夜城。",
	"Small and scattered groups of tieflings are found elsewhere across Faerûn, particularly in cosmopolitan cities (where they can be anonymous to some degree) and in rough and poor settlements that welcome anyone who can help them survive and prosper.": "在整个法鲁恩的其他地方，特别是在国际大都市（在那里他们可以在某种程度上匿名）和欢迎任何能够帮助他们生存和繁荣的人的粗糙和贫穷的定居点，都能发现小而分散的铁弗林群体。",
	"Tieflings are common in Calimshan, to the south, where many of them fought for the djinn as mercenaries and now serve other masters with the coin to pay them. In the east, many tieflings dwell in Aglarond—escaped slaves from Thay or their descendants—and in Mulhorand, where tieflings are believed to carry the blood of the ancient Mulhorandi gods themselves.": "盗贼在南部的卡里姆山很常见，他们中的许多人作为雇佣兵为精灵作战，现在则为其他拥有钱币的主人服务。在东部，许多Tieflings居住在Aglarond--从Thay逃出来的奴隶或他们的后代--以及Mulhorand，在那里Tieflings被认为带有古代Mulhorandi神本身的血液。",
	"Although many Faerûnian folk believe that all tieflings worship Asmodeus and the Lords of the Nine Hells, the truth is that only a fraction of them do so, but enough are devil- or demon-worshipers to lend the weight of truth to all the rumors and suspicion.": "尽管许多法鲁尼亚人认为所有的铁弗林都崇拜阿斯莫德和九层地狱的领主，但事实是他们中只有一小部分人这样做，但有足够多的魔鬼或恶魔崇拜者为所有的谣言和怀疑提供了真理的力量。",
	"Tieflings who revere a god other than Asmodeus often worship deities who watch over and care for outsiders, including Ilmater, Mask, Selûne, Shar, and Tymora. Gods of knowledge, survival, cunning, and warfare are also common attractions for tieflings who value those qualities. Beshaba has tiefling worshipers who consider the accident of their birth as a kind of cruel joke they have chosen to embrace.": "崇尚阿斯莫德以外的神灵的铁皮人通常崇拜那些看护和照顾外来者的神灵，包括伊尔马特、面具、塞鲁恩、沙尔和泰莫拉。知识之神、生存之神、狡猾之神和战争之神也是对重视这些品质的铁皮人的常见吸引力。贝沙巴有一些铁皮人崇拜者，他们认为自己出生的意外是他们选择接受的一种残酷的玩笑。",
	"Equally intriguing and disturbing to followers of some faiths in Faerûn are stories spread by tieflings who claim to have visions in which the gods of Faerûn appear to them modeled in the tieflings' own image. One such is the entity they call the \"pale horned goddess of the moon\" (Selûne); another is the \"dark, devilish lady of fortune\" (Tymora)—an indication, tieflings say, that one's outward appearance and bloodline are less important to the gods than the heart and soul within.": "对法鲁恩的一些信仰的追随者来说，同样令人好奇和不安的是铁皮人传播的故事，他们声称有幻觉，法鲁恩的众神以铁皮人自己的形象出现在他们面前。他们称之为 \"苍白的月角女神\"（Selûne）的实体就是其中之一；另一个是 \"黑暗的、魔鬼般的财富女士\"（Tymora）--铁皮人说，这表明一个人的外貌和血统对诸神来说不如内心和灵魂来得重要。",
	"A great many tiefling parents follow the naming conventions of the culture in which their offspring are born, such as using human names if they live in a human settlement (the better to seem like \"normal\" citizens). Others take names derived from the Infernal language that have been passed down since ancient times.": "很多铁皮人的父母都遵循其后代出生地文化的命名惯例，比如如果他们生活在人类居住区，就使用人类的名字（这样看起来更像 \"正常 \"公民）。还有一些人的名字来自于自古流传下来的炎黄语言。",
	"In addition, some Faerûnian tieflings have names drawn from the language of cultures where they are relatively common and generally accepted, such as Calishite and Mulhorandi, which are foreign-sounding to folk in the North and along the Sword Coast.": "此外，一些法鲁尼亚盗贼的名字来自于他们相对常见并被普遍接受的文化的语言，比如卡利希特和穆尔霍兰迪，这对北方和剑海岸一带的人们来说听起来很陌生。",
	"Al-Khem and Beni-Asmodai are two common Calishite tiefling surnames that proclaim the race's heritage, along with first names such as Haroun, Ishaq, and Nizam (male) or Hania, Rashaa, and Zaar (female).": "Al-Khem和Beni-Asmodai是两个常见的Calishite tiefling姓氏，宣称该种族的遗产，同时还有Haroun、Ishaq和Nizam（男性）或Hania、Rashaa和Zaar（女性）等名字。",
	"Mulhorandi surnames that begin with \"Sia\" or \"Zia\" followed by a god's name indicate a bearer of that god's bloodline, such as Zianhur and Siasobek. First names commonly seen among Mulhorandi tieflings include Aybtep (\"horned\"), Bahati (\"wise soul\"), Het (\"smoke\"), Kamen (\"dark\"), Katsu (\"star born\"), and Kohl (\"dark eyed\").": "以 \"Sia \"或 \"Zia \"开头的Mulhorandi姓氏，后面跟着一个神的名字，表示该神的血统，如Zianhur和Siasobek。在穆尔霍兰迪盗贼中常见的名字包括Aybtep（\"有角\"）、Bahati（\"智慧的灵魂\"）、Het（\"烟雾\"）、Kamen（\"黑暗\"）、Katsu（\"星生\"）和Kohl（\"黑眼睛\"）。",
	"Since not all tieflings are of the blood of Asmodeus, some have traits that differ from those in the Player's Handbook. The Dungeon Master may permit the following variants for your tiefling character, although Devil's Tongue, Hellfire, and Winged are mutually exclusive.": "由于并非所有的铁皮人都是阿斯莫德的血统，所以有些铁皮人的特征与《玩家手册》中的不同。地下城管理员可以允许你的铁皮人角色有以下的变体，尽管恶魔之舌、地狱之火和有翼之人是相互排斥的。",
	"The celestial opposites of the tieflings, aasimar are descended from humans of celestial heritage. Aasimar aren't as prevalent in the Realms as tieflings, but common enough that some become adventurers. Dungeon Masters who want to allow their players to create aasimar characters can find rules for doing so in the Dungeon Master's Guide.": "Aasimar是铁弗林的天体对立面，是天体遗产的人类的后代。阿西玛人在王国中并不像铁皮人那样普遍，但也足够常见，有些人成为了冒险家。如果地下城主想让他们的玩家创建阿西玛人角色，可以在《地下城主指南》中找到相关的规则。",
	"The twelve classes presented in the Player's Handbook are all found in the Forgotten Realms.

	"Closest to the dark elves, pwent lowered his head, with its long helmet spike, and impaled one elf through the chest, blasting through the fine mesh of drow armor easily and brutally. The second drow managed to deflect the next battlerager's charge, turning the helmet spike aside with both his swords. But a mailed fist, the knuckles devilishly spiked with barbed points, caught the drow under the chin and tore a gaping hole in his throat. Fighting for breath, the drow managed to score two nasty hits on his opponent's back, but those two strikes did little in the face of the flurry launched by the wild-eyed dwarf.": "离黑暗精灵最近的普文特低下头，带着长长的头盔尖刺，刺穿了一个精灵的胸膛，轻松而残酷地炸开了乌鸦盔甲的细网。第二个鸦人成功地抵挡了下一个战斗者的冲锋，用他的两把剑把头盔的尖刺转到一边。但是，一只指节上带着魔鬼般的倒刺的拳头抓住了乌鸦的下巴，在他的喉咙上撕开了一个大洞。为了呼吸，乌鸦设法在他的对手的背上打了两下，但这两下在野眼矮人发起的攻击面前没有什么作用。",
	"Many of the lands of the Sword Coast and the North are savage, where day-to-day survival is a struggle. Such lands breed hardy tribes and fierce warriors, such as the Reghed and Uthgardt barbarians of the North and the seafaring Northlanders of the Moonshae Isles and the northernmost reaches of the Sword Coast.": "剑海岸和北方的许多土地是野蛮的，在那里，每天的生存都是一场斗争。这样的土地孕育了坚韧的部落和凶猛的战士，比如北方的雷格德和乌斯加特野蛮人，以及月牙岛和剑海岸最北端的航海的北地人。",
	"Barbarians of these lands are most often humans or half-orcs, occasionally half-elves born of contact between savage human tribes and the elves of the North or Western Heartlands, or tieflings from tribes known to consort with fiends. Dwarf barbarians are famed and feared warriors among the fiercely proud clans that have reclaimed territories like Mithril Hall and Gautlgrym. Barbarians of most other races hail from warmer southern lands, rather than the Savage North, although southern foundlings are sometimes adopted in the North and raised by tribes there.": "这些土地上的野蛮人通常是人类或半兽人，偶尔也有因野蛮的人类部落与北部或西部中心地带的精灵接触而产生的半精灵，或者来自已知与恶魔交配的部落的铁弗林。矮人野蛮人是著名的、令人畏惧的战士，他们在激烈而骄傲的部族中开垦了像米特尔霍尔和高特格林姆这样的领土。大多数其他种族的野蛮人都来自南方温暖的土地，而不是野蛮的北方，尽管南方的弃儿有时会被北方的部落收养并抚养。",

Bards know a great deal, and they tend to be willing to share what they know, or at least barter for it.": "吟游诗人在被遗忘的国度里有着特殊的责任和尊重。他们是新闻、八卦和信息的携带者，在他们的旅行中，除了是历史和民间传说的活仓库外。游吟诗人知道很多东西，他们往往愿意分享他们所知道的东西，或者至少是以物易物。",
	"The arrival of a renowned bard is a special occasion, akin to the visit of a dignitary. A bard can reasonably expect at least a hot supper and a clean place to sleep from a local landlord or inn in exchange for a few songs or stories. A noble might host a bard in fine style—while also being careful to guard any secrets the noble's household doesn't want retold or sung across Faerûn.": "著名吟游诗人的到来是一个特殊的场合，类似于政要的来访。吟游诗人有理由期待当地的房东或旅馆至少提供一顿热腾腾的晚餐和一个干净的地方睡觉，以换取一些歌曲或故事。一个贵族可能会以良好的方式接待吟游诗人--同时也会小心翼翼地保护贵族家庭不希望复述或在法鲁恩传唱的任何秘密。",
	"Not all wandering performers are true bards, nor are all bards inclined to sing for their supper, although most will, given the need. Bards literally have magic to them, and the powers they command through their performance and lore earns them additional respect.": "并非所有的流浪表演者都是真正的吟游诗人，也不是所有的吟游诗人都倾向于为他们的晚餐唱歌，尽管大多数人在有需要的情况下会这样做。吟游诗人在字面上具有魔力，他们通过自己的表演和传说所获得的力量为他们赢得了额外的尊重。",
	"In the Savage North, singers and storytellers called skalds are keepers of the history and great legends of the Northlanders and the Reghed. These warrior-poets are the singers of the songs and sagas that fire the blood of warriors in battle, and composers of the new songs and sagas relating the mighty deeds of heroes and villains. However, spellcasting is taboo among Reghed and Norhtlanders unless it is considered a gift of their gods. Characters with the bard class who rise to prominence among these folk must align themselves with their clan's priests and shamans or risk being outcast. Most skalds are members of the College of Valor, as described in the Bard College class feature in the Player's Handbook.": "在野蛮的北方，被称为skalds的歌手和讲故事的人是北地人和Reghed的历史和伟大传说的守护者。这些战士诗人是歌曲和传奇的演唱者，他们在战斗中燃烧着战士的血液，也是与英雄和恶棍的强大事迹有关的新歌曲和传奇的作曲者。然而，除非被认为是他们的神的礼物，否则法术在瑞格德和诺赫兰人中是禁忌。拥有吟游诗人等级的角色如果在这些民族中崭露头角，就必须与他们部落的祭司和巫师结盟，否则就有可能被抛弃。大多数吟游诗人都是英勇学院的成员，正如《玩家手册》中吟游诗人学院类别特征中所描述的那样。",
	"Bards in the North and the Dalelands benefit from the existence of the Harpers, that legendary society recruiting bards and other independent agents to struggle against the forces of evil. Even though most bards in the region aren't Harpers (and many who are don't advertise that fact), common folk in the North often behave as if all bards are legendary wandering heroes, and are as likely to ask a bard for the solution to a problem troubling their community as they are a wandering fighter or wizard. This reputation cuts both ways, however, as some enemies of the Harpers suspiciously assume any humble minstrel might secretly be a Harper agent.": "北方和达利兰地区的吟游诗人得益于哈珀斯的存在，这个传说中的社团招募吟游诗人和其他独立代理人，与邪恶势力作斗争。尽管该地区的大多数吟游诗人都不是哈珀斯人（而且许多是哈珀斯人的人也不宣传这一事实），但北方的普通民众往往表现得好像所有吟游诗人都是传奇的流浪英雄，他们有可能向吟游诗人询问困扰他们社区的问题的解决方案，就像他们向流浪的战士或巫师询问一样。然而，这种声誉是双向的，因为哈珀人的一些敌人怀疑任何卑微的吟游诗人可能秘密地是哈珀人的代理人。",
	"Over a century ago, the Harpers endured a schism. Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun was denounced by other Harper leaders for empowering Fzoul Chembryl, then the evil leader of the Zhentarim, with a powerful artifact. That Khelben did so in order that Fzoul destroy a dangerous lich mattered little. Khelben and Laeral Silverhand, his wife, left the Harpers then, taking with them certain agents and folding them into to a different organization, which Khelben had been secretly working to create for some time due to an old prophecy of the elves of Cormanthor. This group was the Moonstars, called Tel'Teukiira in Elvish. Although the Moonstars worked in concert at times with the Harpers, they also worked at cross purposes, and the Moonstars membership included many whom the Harpers considered too evil, such as a vampire. The Moonstars performed many good deeds, but their methods were often more brutal and pragmatic than the Harpers' lofty ideals allowed. When Khelben died, the Moonstars seemed to collapse, and for many years the organization was assumed defunct. Yet during the Sundering, Moonstar sleeper agents reactivated the organization on a surprisingly massive scale, with members active in Candlekeep, Waterdeep, and Myth Drannor. The organization has since gone underground again. Their relationship to the present-day Harpers, Laeral Silverhand, and the current Blackstaff of Waterdeep, Vajra, remains unclear.": "一个多世纪前，哈珀人经历了一次分裂。Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun被哈珀人的其他领导人谴责，因为他用一件强大的神器授权给Fzoul Chembryl，当时是Zhentarim的邪恶领袖。Khelben这样做是为了让Fzoul摧毁一个危险的巫师，这一点并不重要。Khelben和他的妻子Laeral Silverhand离开了Harpers，带走了一些特工，并将他们编入一个不同的组织，由于Cormanthor精灵的一个古老预言，Khelben已经秘密工作了一段时间来创建这个组织。这个组织就是 \"月星\"，在精灵语中称为 \"Tel'Teukiira\"。虽然Moonstars有时会与哈珀人合作，但他们也有交叉工作，Moonstars的成员包括许多哈珀人认为过于邪恶的人，比如一个吸血鬼。月星人做了很多善事，但他们的方法往往比哈珀人的崇高理想更残酷和务实。当Khelben死后，月星组织似乎崩溃了，许多年来该组织被认为已经不存在了。然而，在毁灭期间，月星的潜伏人员以惊人的规模重新激活了该组织，其成员活跃在烛台镇、沃特迪普和神话德兰诺。此后，该组织再次转入地下。他们与现今的哈珀斯、银手（Laeral Silverhand）以及目前水底世界的黑杖（Vajra）的关系仍不清楚。",
	"In addition to the tradition of apprenticing with a master bard, the Sword Coast has some bardic colleges where masters teach students the bardic arts. They hark back to the great bardic colleges of the distant past, particularly the seven elder colleges: Fochlucan, Mac-Fuirmidh, Doss, Canaith, Cli, Anstruth, and Ollamh. These seven are said to be the origin of the instrument of the bards, each of which is named after one of the colleges. See chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for the game statistics of these magic instruments.": "除了跟随吟游诗人大师学徒的传统外，剑海岸还有一些吟游诗人学院，大师们在那里教授学生吟游艺术。它们可以追溯到遥远的过去的伟大吟游诗人学院，特别是七所长老学院。福克兰（Fochlucan）、麦克-福尔米德（Mac-Fuirmidh）、多斯（Doss）、卡奈斯（Canaith）、克莱（Cli）、安斯特鲁斯（Anstruth）和奥兰姆（Ollamh）。据说这七个学院是吟游诗人乐器的起源，每个学院都是以其中一个学院命名的。关于这些魔法乐器的游戏统计，请参见《地下城管理员指南》第七章。",
	"Long ago, bards who sought the rank of master bard attended each of the elder colleges, seeking to learn its musical and magical secrets. Traditionally, the colleges were attended in the order given above, starting with Fochlucan. That tradition fell when the colleges went into decline, but some bards dream of restoring it.": "很久以前，追求吟游诗人大师级别的吟游诗人参加了每所长老学院，寻求学习其音乐和魔法的秘密。传统上，这些学院是按照上述顺序就读的，从福克卢坎开始。这一传统随着学院的衰落而衰落，但一些吟游诗人梦想恢复这一传统。",
	"The original College of Fochlucan once stood on the northeastern edge of Silverymoon. Many years after it closed its doors, the site was reopened as Ultrumm's Music Conservatory. The conservatory later moved to Southbank, and the House of the Harp occupied the college's original location under the guidance of Master Bard Forell \"Flamebeard\" Luekuan, who sought to revive the ancient traditions and teachings of Fochlucan. Years of cultivation and support from Silverymoon, as well as the Harpers, yielded a faculty able to revive the college, and the House of the Harp adopted the Fochlucan name once again. Most of its bards study and practice the methods of the College of Lore, as described in the Bard College class feature in the Player's Handbook.": "最初的福克卢肯学院曾经矗立在银月岛的东北部边缘。关门多年后，这里作为奥特姆的音乐学院重新开放。音乐学院后来搬到了南岸，而竖琴之家则在吟游诗人福瑞尔-\"火焰熊\"-吕宽大师的指导下占据了学院的原址，他试图恢复福克卢肯的古老传统和教义。多年的培养和来自银月的支持，以及哈珀人的支持，产生了一个能够恢复学院的师资队伍，竖琴之家再次采用了佛克卢坎的名字。它的大多数吟游诗人都在学习和实践传说学院的方法，正如《玩家手册》中的吟游诗人学院类别特征中所描述的那样。",
	"The College of Fochlucan is naturally allied with the Harpers, although its master bards are careful to stress that its mission is separate from that of the Harpers.": "福克卢坎学院自然与哈珀斯结盟，尽管它的吟游诗人大师小心翼翼地强调它的任务与哈珀斯的任务是分开的。",
	"Housed in two Cliffride villas overlooking the sea near Waterdeep, the College of New Olamn is a prestigious bardic college established in the Year of the Staff (1366 DR) by wealthy Waterdhavian patrons and named for the old College of Ollamh.

	"The Cliffride, a gravel path up Mount Waterdeep's northern spur, is used to bring goods to the college, but most visitors and students use the Mount Melody Walk—a tunnel through the mountain itself—to reach it. The tunnel regularly resounds with music, thanks to the Neverending String of Pearls, an ongoing concert where bardic students perform in a small alcove in the tunnel, which carries and echoes their music.": "克莱夫里德（Cliffride）山是沃特德普山北侧支脉的一条碎石路，用于向学院运送货物，但大多数游客和学生都使用美乐山步道--一条穿过山体本身的隧道来到达学院。隧道里经常响起音乐，这要归功于 \"无尽的珍珠之弦\"，这是一场持续的音乐会，吟游诗人的学生在隧道里的一个小凹槽里表演，隧道里传出并回荡着他们的音乐。",
	"Based at the great lore-house of Herald's Holdfast, northwest of Silverymoon, the College of the Herald is dedicated to the preservation of ancient history and legends. The Heralds are charged with collecting and organizing bodies of lore, which they make available to all of good and peaceful intent.

	"The College of the Herald is less concerned with musical performance (although it contains a considerable library of songs) and more with history, heraldry, and folklore, making it a key center of learning for bards of the College of Lore, as described in the Bard College class feature in the Player's Handbook.": "牧羊人学院不太关注音乐表演（尽管它包含一个相当大的歌曲库），而更关注历史、纹章学和民间传说，这使得它成为洛尔学院吟游诗人的重要学习中心，正如《玩家手册》中的巴德学院类别特征中所描述的那样。",
	"In addition to the common musical instruments listed in chapter 5, \"Equipment,\" of the Player's Handbook, bards in the Realms play the following instruments:": "除了《玩家手册》第5章 \"装备 \"中列出的常见乐器外，王国的吟游诗人还会演奏以下乐器。",

	"Also known as a whistlecane, a simple and easy-to-make wind instrument cut from a reed. They are so simple, in fact, that skilled bards frequently make and give them away to children—to the parents' delight or regret.": "又称哨子，是一种用芦苇剪成的简单而容易制作的管乐器。事实上，它们是如此简单，以至于熟练的吟游诗人经常制作并把它们送给孩子们，让父母高兴或遗憾。",
	"A hanging set of carved oval bells, usually played with a pair of light wooden hammers (or open handed). They are most common in underground cultures, where the resonant tones can carry.": "一套悬挂的雕花椭圆钟，通常用一对轻巧的木锤（或张开手）演奏。它们在地下文化中最为常见，因为那里的共鸣音可以传播。",
	"A metal gong, traditionally made from a shield, particularly the shield of an enemy. Both goblins and dwarves make and play wargongs, their sound echoing through tunnels in the Underdark.": "一种金属锣，传统上是用盾牌制作的，特别是敌人的盾牌。地精和矮人都会制作和演奏战鼓，它们的声音在地下世界的隧道中回荡。",
	"A southern instrument from Amn and Calimshan that is a Faerûnian analog to the guitar. Numerous variations have spread across the continent.": "一种来自安恩和卡里姆山的南方乐器，是法鲁尼亚的类似吉他的乐器。众多的变体已经遍布整个大陆。",

	"The gods are most active through their chosen clerics, who carry out the gods' work on the Material Plane. A typical cleric in Faerûn serves a single divine patron, but some individuals feel called to serve a group, such as the elemental gods Akadi, Grumbar, Kossuth, and Istishia, while others serve deities that are intertwined gods, such as the elves' Angharradh.": "诸神通过他们选择的神职人员最活跃，他们在物质世界执行诸神的工作。在法鲁恩，一个典型的神职人员服务于一个神的守护者，但有些人觉得被召唤去服务一个群体，比如元素神阿卡迪、格伦巴、科苏斯和伊斯特希亚，而其他人服务的神是交织在一起的神，比如精灵族的安格拉德。",
	"Some clerics in Faerûn belong to an established religious hierarchy, but many do not. The gods choose whomever they will, and sometimes a devoted worshiper is blessed with all the abilities of a cleric, despite not being a priest of any kind. That cleric might be a contemplative hermit, a wandering prophet, or simply a devout peasant. Religious orders often try to recruit such clerics and bring them into the fold, but not all of those clerics wish to be bound to a hierarchy.": "法鲁恩的一些神职人员属于既定的宗教等级，但许多人不属于。诸神随心所欲地选择谁，有时一个虔诚的崇拜者尽管不是任何种类的牧师，却被赋予了牧师的所有能力。这个教士可能是一个沉思的隐士，一个流浪的先知，或者只是一个虔诚的农民。宗教组织经常试图招募这样的教士，并将他们带入教团，但并不是所有的教士都希望被束缚在一个等级制度中。",
	"Conversely, not everyone who pursues a religious vocation is a true cleric. Some acolytes discover a different path for their lives than the path of the cleric. They serve their faiths in other roles, such as priests, scholars, or artisans, while some go on to vocations that have nothing to do with religion. A few souls who are denied the path of the cleric become embittered and seek favor with sinister or forbidden gods or forge pacts with other powerful entities. Religious scholars in the Realms debate whether divine rejection led such a person to embrace a dark path or whether the person was rejected because the gods foresaw the potential for darkness in the person's future. The gods remain silent on the matter.": "相反，并非每个追求宗教使命的人都是真正的教士。有些圣徒发现自己的生活道路与教士的道路不同。他们以其他角色为自己的信仰服务，如牧师、学者或工匠，而有些人则继续从事与宗教无关的职业。少数被剥夺了教士之路的灵魂变得愤世嫉俗，向邪恶的或被禁止的神灵寻求恩惠，或与其他强大的实体缔结契约。各个王国的宗教学者争论不休，究竟是神的拒绝导致这样的人走上了黑暗的道路，还是因为神预见到这个人的未来可能会出现黑暗，所以才被拒绝。诸神对这个问题保持沉默。",
	"Some clerics are homebodies who serve a particular community of the faithful, but adventuring clerics tend to have a certain crusading zeal to do their deity's work in the wider world. This work may include ministering to far-flung communities, as well as seeking out and defeating threats to the civilized world.": "有些神职人员在家里为某个特定的信徒群体服务，但冒险的神职人员往往有某种讨伐的热情，在更广阔的世界里做他们神的工作。这项工作可能包括为遥远的社区提供服务，以及寻找并击败对文明世界的威胁。",
	"Clerics in the Forgotten Realms have the following Divine Domain option, in addition to those in the Player's Handbook.": "除了《玩家手册》中的选项外，《被遗忘的国度》中的牧师还拥有以下神域选项。",
	"The druids of the Realms venerate nature in all its forms, as well as the gods of the First Circle, those deities closest to the power and majesty of the natural world. That group of gods includes Chauntea, Eldath, Mielikki, Silvanus, as well as Auril, Malar, Talos, and Umberlee, for nature is many-sided and not always kind.": "领域的德鲁伊们崇尚所有形式的自然，以及第一圈的神灵，那些最接近自然界力量和威严的神灵。这群神包括Chauntea、Eldath、Mielikki、Silvanus，以及Auril、Malar、Talos和Umberlee，因为大自然是多面的，并不总是仁慈。",
	"Unlike clerics, who typically serve a single deity, druids revere all the gods of the First Circle in their turn, and see them as embodiments of the natural world, which moves in cycles: creation and destruction, waxing and withering, life and death. Thus, Grumbar isn't just god of the earth to a druid; he is the fertile soil and the rolling hills themselves. Malar isn't just the Beastlord, but the hunger and the hunting instinct of a predatory beast.": "德鲁伊不像牧师那样通常只侍奉一个神灵，他们依次崇敬第一圈的所有神灵，并将他们视为自然界的化身，自然界在循环中运动：创造与毁灭，枯萎与凋零，生命与死亡。因此，对德鲁伊来说，格伦巴不仅仅是大地之神；他是肥沃的土壤和起伏的山丘本身。马拉尔不仅是兽神，而且是饥饿和掠夺性野兽的狩猎本能。",
	"Although they are most strongly associated with sylvan forests, druids care for all aspects of the land, including frozen mountains, burning deserts, rolling hills, and rough coasts.": "虽然他们与森林有最紧密的联系，但德鲁伊关心土地的所有方面，包括冰冻的山脉、燃烧的沙漠、起伏的山丘和粗糙的海岸。",
	"Druidic ways are ancient and largely practiced in secret, away from the eyes of the uninitiated. In many lands, the Old Ways of the First Circle have given way to new churches and temples, but druids and their followers still gather to honor the cycles of nature and to ensure the natural balance isn't threatened. People who dwell in or near wild lands do well to learn if a druid circle operates nearby, seeking the circle's blessing before hunting or farming on the lands they protect.": "德鲁伊的方式很古老，而且大部分是秘密进行的，远离不熟悉的人的眼睛。在许多地方，第一圈的古老方式已经让位于新的教堂和寺庙，但德鲁伊和他们的追随者仍然聚集在一起，尊重大自然的循环，确保自然平衡不受威胁。居住在野地或附近的人最好了解附近是否有德鲁伊圈，在他们保护的土地上打猎或耕种之前寻求圈的祝福。",
	"The druid habit of gathering in clearings, wooded groves, or around sacred pools gave rise to the tradition of circles. In a circle, all are equal, and while respect is given to age and accomplishment, the circle reaches decisions as a whole. Those who disagree are free to argue their point, or even to leave the circle, if they wish, but the circle acts as one for the good of all. Druid circles often include non-druid allies, such as rangers, wood elves, and the fey creatures of the land where the circle meets, all given equal voice.": "德鲁伊人在空地、树林或圣池周围聚会的习惯产生了圈子的传统。在一个圈子里，所有人都是平等的，虽然尊重年龄和成就，但圈子作为一个整体达成决定。那些不同意的人可以自由地争论他们的观点，甚至离开圈子，如果他们愿意的话，但圈子作为一个整体为所有人的利益行事。德鲁伊圈子通常包括非德鲁伊盟友，如游侠、木精灵和圈子所在土地上的精灵生物，他们都有平等的发言权。",
	"Numerous circles are found across Faerûn, usually made up of no more than a dozen or so druids, plus their allies. They include the High Dance, guarding the Dancing Place in the high valleys of the Thunder Peaks, alongside their fey allies. The Watchers of Sevreld meet in Old Mushroom Grove in the High Forest, northeast of Secomber, and the Starwater Circle gathers around their namesake pool in the northern forest of Mir.": "在整个法鲁恩有许多圈子，通常由不超过十几个德鲁伊，加上他们的盟友组成。他们包括高级舞蹈团，与他们的费伊盟友一起守护着雷峰高谷中的舞蹈之地。塞弗瑞德的守望者在塞康伯东北部高森林的老蘑菇林聚会，而星水圈则聚集在米尔北部森林的同名水池周围。",
	"Protectors of the Neverwinter Wood, the Circle of Swords drives destructive humanoids like hobgoblins, bugbears, and their kin from the wood, while also safeguarding it against exploitation at the hands of civilized folk and protecting the wood's ancient ruins and sacred sites from looters.": "剑之环是永夜森林的保护者，他们将霍布林、虫人和他们的亲属等破坏性的人类赶出森林，同时也保护森林不受文明人的剥削，并保护森林的古老遗迹和圣地不被劫掠。",
	"In the Druid Circle class feature in the Player's Handbook, the Circle of the Moon is common for Circle of Swords druids, although some belong to the Circle of the Land (Forest).": "在《玩家手册》中的德鲁伊圆环等级特征中，月之圆环是剑之圆环德鲁伊常见的，尽管有些人属于地之圆环（森林）。",
	"Less a druid circle and more a loose confederation of circles and their allies, the Emerald Enclave is devoted to protecting the redoubt of civilization in the North from destruction. Elsewhere in the world, the Emerald Enclave must pursue a more balanced path, but the vast wilderness of the North holds far more danger to people than they pose to it.": "与其说是德鲁伊圈子，不如说是圈子及其盟友的松散联盟，绿宝石飞地致力于保护北方的文明堡垒不受破坏。在世界的其他地方，翡翠飞地必须追求一条更平衡的道路，但北方广阔的荒野对人们的危险远远大于他们对它的危险。",
	"Founded in the Vilhon Reach over a thousand years ago, the Emerald Enclave has spread across much of Faerûn. Its members include druids, rangers, barbarians, and others who live in the wilderness and know and respect its ways. They wear an article of emerald green clothing as a symbol of their membership, often bearing the emblem of a stag's head.": "一千多年前，翡翠飞地在维尔洪河畔成立，现在已经遍布法鲁恩的大部分地区。其成员包括德鲁伊、游侠、野蛮人和其他生活在荒野中并了解和尊重荒野的人。他们穿着一件翠绿色的衣服作为他们成员的象征，上面通常有一个鹿头的标志。",
	"In the Druid Circle class feature in the Player's Handbook, Emerald Enclave druids belong to the Circle of the Land and Circle of the Moon in equal measure.": "在《玩家手册》中的德鲁伊圆环类特征中，翡翠飞地的德鲁伊属于土地圆环和月亮圆环，两者的地位相当。",
	"The folk of the Moonshea Isles venerate the land as the great goddess they call the Earthmother. Their circles gather around sacred pools known as moonwells, their link between the natural world and the goddess, ringed by standing stone circles, raised by their ancient ancestors.": "月神岛的居民将这片土地尊为他们称之为大地母亲的伟大女神。他们的圈子聚集在被称为月亮井的圣池周围，这是他们连接自然界和女神的纽带，周围是他们古老的祖先竖起的石圈。",

	"The water of a moonwell, drunk directly from cupped hands, restores 1d8 hit points, plus the drinker's Wisdom bonus, if any. If the drinker has threatened the balance of nature since the last full moon, the water instead deals 1d8 poison damage to the drinker. This damage is also dealt by a corrupted moonwell. Either effect occurs once only per day per drinker. On the nights of the full moon, drinking the water of a moonwell can, at the DM's discretion, have additional effects, such as conferring the benefits of a lesser restoration spell.": "直接从双手捧起的月井水喝下，可以恢复1d8的命中率，加上饮用者的智慧值，如果有的话。如果饮用者在上一次满月后威胁到了自然界的平衡，水会对饮用者造成1d8的毒伤害。这种伤害也会由腐败的月井造成。每位饮酒者每天只发生一次这两种效果。在月圆之夜，根据DM的决定，饮用月井的水可以有额外的效果，例如赋予一个较小的恢复法术的好处。",
	"Moonwell water placed in a container or taken more than 30 feet away from the well no longer has any of these properties; it is simply water.": "放在容器中的月井水或在离井30英尺以上的地方抽取的月井水不再具有任何这些特性；它只是水。",
	"On the three nights of the full moon, three or more druids gathered around a moonwell can cast commune and scrying once each without expending spell slots and without material components, provided that one of the druids is at least 9th level and the rest are at least 4th level. At the DM's option, the druids can use a moonwell on such nights to cast different spells.": "在月圆之夜的三个晚上，三个或更多的德鲁伊聚集在月井周围，可以在不消耗法术槽和材料组件的情况下各施展一次交际和窥探术，条件是其中一个德鲁伊至少是9级，其余的至少是4级。在DM的选择下，德鲁伊们可以在这样的夜晚使用月井来施展不同的法术。",
	"Druid circles in the North are often allied with the Harpers, as they have common purpose, with bards and rangers serving as go-betweens. Individual Harpers can usually expect a circle to at least grant them food and shelter, and an opportunity to attend a gathering and speak, if they wish.": "北方的德鲁伊圈子经常与哈珀人结盟，因为他们有共同的目的，吟游诗人和游侠充当中间人。个别哈珀人通常可以期待一个圈子至少给予他们食物和住所，如果他们愿意，还可以有机会参加聚会并发言。",
	"Still, the Harpers aren't a druidic organization and, despite what some common folk might believe, not every druid or druid circle is allied with, or even friendly toward, the Harpers and their cause. Indeed, some druids consider the Harpers busybodies who threaten the natural balance almost as much as the evils that they fight against.": "尽管如此，哈珀人并不是一个德鲁伊组织，而且，尽管一些普通人可能相信，并不是每个德鲁伊或德鲁伊圈子都与哈珀人和他们的事业结盟，甚至是友好的。事实上，一些德鲁伊认为哈珀人是个忙人，他们对自然平衡的威胁几乎与他们所对抗的邪恶一样大。",

The dictate to seek physical perfection and recognize hidden virtue has similarity to Sune's teachings about physical and spiritual beauty. Followers of Selûne recognize their goddess's exhortation to battle darkness and seek virtue. And of course, Lathander's association with the sun links to the Sun Soul philosophy, but more critically for worshipers of Lathander, they see the idea of granting and taking new chances as similar to Lathander's emphasis on new beginnings.": "由于戒律与一些信仰的教义相似，太阳魂教团长期以来与寺庙和三个特殊神灵的信徒有联系。Sune、Selûne和Lathander。追求身体的完美和认识隐藏的美德的口令与苏内关于身体和精神之美的教义有相似之处。塞卢恩的追随者认识到他们的女神劝告他们与黑暗作斗争并寻求美德。当然，拉桑德与太阳的联系与太阳灵魂哲学有关，但对拉桑德的崇拜者来说更关键的是，他们认为授予和把握新机会的理念与拉桑德强调新的开始相似。",
	"Followers of the Way of the Long Death worship the principle of death more so than any deity of death. These monks seek the secrets of life by studying death itself. It is the condition of being dead that concerns them most, and not what lies beyond; the afterlife holds little interest for them. Their monasteries are full of decaying, dying, and dead animal and plant specimens, which they study with detached interest. They frequently purchase rare specimens from adventurers and merchants that they can't obtain easily themselves. But such studies are only part of the monks' daily life: They seek to understand death as it pertains especially to intelligent living beings, and to this end they eagerly welcome the diseased and the dying so that they might watch and record their deaths. If such unfortunates seek release from pain through death, the monks provide it. They view death as a gift that they bestow on those who are ready for it. Their means of determining readiness vary from one sect (or even one monk) to another.": "长期死亡之道的追随者对死亡原则的崇拜超过了对任何死亡神灵的崇拜。这些僧侣通过研究死亡本身来寻求生命的奥秘。他们最关心的是死亡的状况，而不是后面的东西；来世对他们来说兴趣不大。他们的寺院里充满了腐烂、垂死和死亡的动物和植物标本，他们以超然的兴趣研究这些标本。他们经常从冒险家和商人那里购买他们自己无法轻易得到的稀有标本。但这种研究只是僧侣们日常生活的一部分。他们寻求了解死亡，因为它特别与智慧生物有关，为此他们热切地欢迎病人和垂死的人，以便他们可以观察和记录他们的死亡。如果这些不幸的人通过死亡寻求痛苦的释放，僧侣们会提供这种释放。他们视死亡为一种礼物，并将其赐予那些准备好的人。他们确定准备好的方法因教派（甚至一个僧侣）而异。",
	"The monks suffer no moral qualms about these deeds, for death is the most natural thing in the world, from their perspective, and to expire in service to its principle is one of the most profoundly holy experiences a living being can hope to enjoy. It is for this reason that the monks themselves do not fear death.": "僧侣们对这些行为没有任何道德上的顾虑，因为从他们的角度来看，死亡是世界上最自然的事情，而为其原则服务而死亡是一个生命体所希望享有的最深刻的神圣体验之一。正是由于这个原因，僧侣们自己并不害怕死亡。",
	"Most of the order's members are either scholars who share mutual fascination with death and dying or clergy who worship one of the deities concerned with death.

When death is truly understood, it can be harnessed and used as a tool for the betterment of all, or so they rationalize to themselves.": "该组织的大多数成员要么是对死亡和濒临死亡共同着迷的学者，要么是崇拜与死亡有关的神灵之一的神职人员。一些僧侣认为自己是有远见的人，他们的工作将为所有Faerûn的美好未来铺平道路。当死亡被真正理解时，它可以被驾驭，并被用作改善所有人的工具，或者说，他们对自己的看法是合理的。",

The owl responded with a whoo, then went off into a complicated series of chattering hoots and whoos. Montolio took it all in, weighing every detail. With the help of his friends, particularly this rather talkative owl, the ranger had monitored the drow for several days, curious as to why a dark elf had wandered into the valley. At first, Montolio had assumed that the drow was somehow connected to Graul, the chief orc of the region, but as time went on, the ranger began to suspect differently.": "蒙托利奥伸出手臂，大猫头鹰迅速跳上手臂，小心翼翼地在男人厚重的皮袖子上找到自己的立足点。\"你见过那个乌鸦吗？\" 蒙托利奥问道。猫头鹰回应了一声，然后就进入了一连串复杂的叫声和呼噜声中。蒙托利奥把这一切都看在眼里，权衡着每一个细节。在他的朋友们的帮助下，特别是这只相当健谈的猫头鹰，护林员已经监视了乌鸦好几天了，他很好奇为什么一个黑暗精灵会游荡到山谷里。起初，蒙托利奥认为这个乌鸦与这个地区的兽人首领格劳尔有某种联系，但随着时间的推移，护林员开始怀疑这一点。",
	"Long have rangers walked the wilds of the Sword Coast and the Savage Frontier. Like druids, their practices date back to the earliest days of humanity. And long before humans set foot in the North, elf rangers strode through its forests and climbed its mountains. The traditions and outlook of these people are now shared by members of many races. In particular, lightfoot halflings frequently hear the call of the wild and become rangers, often acting as guides and protectors of roving halfling bands, and shield dwarves forced to wander far from old clanholds sometimes follow the ranger's path.": "长久以来，游侠们在剑海岸和野蛮边境的荒野上行走。像德鲁伊一样，他们的做法可以追溯到人类最早的时代。而早在人类踏足北方之前，精灵游侠就已经在北方的森林中漫步，并攀登其山脉。这些人的传统和观念现在被许多种族的成员所共享。特别是，轻足半身人经常听到野外的呼唤而成为游侠，经常充当游荡的半身人队伍的向导和保护者，而被迫远离旧部族的盾牌矮人有时会走上游侠的道路。",
	"Not every prospector wandering far hills or trapper hunting through uninhabited lands becomes a ranger. True rangers go out into nature and find it holy, and like paladins, they are touched by something divine.

While by no means always aligned with one another, rangers are bound into a loose community of sorts—one that often connects with circles of druids.": "不是每一个在远山徘徊的探矿者或在无人居住的土地上狩猎的捕猎者都会成为游侠。真正的游骑兵走入自然，发现它是神圣的，就像圣骑士一样，他们被某种神圣的东西所触动。他们的神和信条可能不同，但游侠们对自然的神圣性有着相似的价值观。虽然游侠们并不总是彼此结盟，但他们被束缚在一个松散的团体中--这个团体通常与德鲁伊的圈子联系在一起。",
	"In the North and throughout much of the Heartlands, rangers use special marks to indicate campsites, dangerous areas, evil creatures, foul magic, goblinoid activity, hidden caches of supplies, safe passage, shelter, and graves or tombs. Many of these symbols were derived from elven lore or borrowed from groups like the Harpers. While by no means a secret language, these trail marks are often obtuse to non-rangers, and even druids might not understand them.": "在北方和整个心脏地带的大部分地区，护林员使用特殊的标记来表示营地、危险区域、邪恶的生物、邪恶的魔法、妖精的活动、隐藏的物资库、安全通道、庇护所、以及坟墓或墓葬。这些符号中有许多来自精灵的传说，或者是从哈珀人等团体那里借来的。虽然这绝不是一种秘密语言，但这些痕迹对非游侠来说往往是晦涩难懂的，甚至德鲁伊也可能不理解它们。",
	"As a whole, rangers serve to help societies survive and thrive in the wilderness. Much of the Sword Coast and the North are unsettled. Rangers are driven to explore these lands, searching for fertile soil in which the seeds of civilization might grow, seeking resources (such as metals) that will benefit settled lands, or rooting out evil before it can spread. Other rangers spy on enemy troops or hunt down dangerous beasts or criminals. Given that so much of the North is frontier, rangers play a critical role in keeping communities safe and are often admired within them.": "作为一个整体，护林员的作用是帮助社会在荒野中生存和发展。剑海岸和北方的大部分地区都未被开发。游骑兵被驱使去探索这些土地，寻找文明种子可能生长的肥沃土壤，寻找有利于定居地的资源（如金属），或者在邪恶蔓延之前将其根除。其他游骑兵则负责监视敌军或追捕危险的野兽或罪犯。鉴于北方的大部分地区都是边疆，护林员在保持社区安全方面发挥着关键作用，并经常在社区内受到敬仰。",
	"Human rangers of the Moonshaes are devoted to the Earthmother, and those that work closely with druid circles on the mainland often honor the gods of the First Circle, but most rangers among humans favor the goddess Mielikki. However, they consider the goddess too wild and primal for them to pray to directly. Instead, they pray to Gwaeron Windstrom to bring their words to the goddess. Gwaeron is said to sleep in a grove of trees west of the town of Triboar, and most of his followers travel to that place at least once in their lives as a holy pilgrimage. Evil human rangers usually honor Malar for his ferocity and hunting skill.": "月海的人类游侠对大地之母很虔诚，那些与大陆上的德鲁伊圈子紧密合作的游侠通常敬重第一圈的神灵，但人类中的大多数游侠都喜欢米利基女神。然而，他们认为这位女神太过野性和原始，他们不能直接向其祈祷。相反，他们向格瓦隆-温德斯特伦（Gwaeron Windstrom）祈祷，让他把他们的话带给女神。据说格瓦隆睡在特里波尔镇西边的一片树林里，他的大多数追随者一生中至少要去一次那个地方，作为神圣的朝圣之旅。邪恶的人类游侠们通常因马拉尔的凶猛和狩猎技巧而对他表示敬意。",
	"Elf rangers are usually associated with a particular community such as Evereska or the tribes in the Misty Forest. Rather than being wandering explorers, elf rangers typically act as scouts and guardians of elven realms. Such elves usually devote themselves to Rillifane Rallathil or Solonor Thelandria. Elf rangers driven to roam might instead favor Fenmarel Mestarine, god of lone wanderers, or Shevarash, elven god of vengeance.": "精灵游侠通常与一个特定的社区有关，如埃弗里斯卡或迷雾森林的部落。与其说精灵游侠是流浪的探险家，不如说他们通常充当精灵王国的侦察兵和守护者。这样的精灵通常献身于瑞利凡-拉拉蒂尔或索洛诺-塞兰德里亚。被驱使漫游的精灵游侠可能会转而偏爱孤独的流浪者之神芬玛勒-梅斯塔林，或者精灵的复仇之神谢瓦拉什。",
	"Most halflings who revere nature and its raw beauty come from lightfoot stock. Their bands spend at least as much time on the road and river as in village and town, and the role of a ranger is a natural fit with the lifestyle of most lightfoots. Lightfoot rangers tend to favor the god Brandobaris in his aspect as patron of exploration. Halflings more inclined toward nature itself typically prefer Sheela Peryroyl. Those who devote themselves more to the protection of settlements or travelers honor Arvoreen. The few strongheart halflings who become rangers tend to favor those latter two deities.": "大多数崇尚自然和原始之美的半身人都来自光脚族。他们的队伍在道路和河流上花费的时间至少与在村庄和城镇中花费的时间一样多，而护林员的角色与大多数光脚族的生活方式自然地契合。光脚族的护林员倾向于支持布兰多巴利斯神，因为他是探险的守护神。更倾向于自然本身的半身人通常喜欢Sheela Peryroyl。那些更多致力于保护定居点或旅行者的半身人则尊崇Arvoreen。少数成为游骑兵的强心半身人倾向于支持后两个神。",
	"Most dwarves prefer to hunker down under a mountain, rather than roam the wilderness of the surface or the Underdark. Most often, a dwarf ranger is either a shield dwarf cast out of a clanhold or a clanless dwarf seeking a place in the world. Sometimes dwarf rangers are prospectors who explore the world seeking new veins of ore. In any case, there are two deities who appeal to such dwarves: Marthammor Duin and Dumathoin.": "大多数矮人喜欢蜷缩在山下，而不是在地表或地下世界的荒野中游荡。最常见的情况是，矮人游侠要么是被赶出氏族的盾牌矮人，要么是在这个世界上寻求一席之地的无氏族矮人。有时，矮人游侠是探索世界寻找新矿脉的勘探者。在任何情况下，有两个神灵吸引着这类矮人。马尔萨莫-杜因和杜马托因。",
	"There are those whose abilities lie not with sword or the Art, but with quiet motion, dexterous action, and stealth. Such talents often lead to illegal endeavors, which plague most major cities, but can be placed to good use in dealing with dangerous monsters and lost treasure.": "有些人的能力不在于剑或艺术，而在于安静的运动、灵巧的行动和隐蔽。这样的才能往往导致非法的努力，这困扰着大多数大城市，但在处理危险的怪物和丢失的宝藏时可以得到很好的利用。",
	"Most large cities in the Realms have a number of thieves' dens that compete with one another. A few places, such as Baldur's Gate, have an organized group of rogues that controls all such activity. Most thieves' dens are secret gathering spots, often beneath the city, and move after they're discovered.": "大多数王国的大城市都有一些相互竞争的盗贼窝点。少数地方，例如博德之门，有一个有组织的流氓团体控制着所有此类活动。大多数盗贼窝点都是秘密的聚集点，通常在城市的地下，被发现后就会转移。",
	"The city of Waterdeep had once been home to the most powerful guild of thieves in the North: the Shadow Thieves. The Lords of Waterdeep smashed that guild, forcing its leaders to flee the city (the group still operates out of Amn). There are still thieves and even assassins in Waterdeep, but they are broken into innumerable small groups or operate alone.": "水底城曾经是北方最强大的盗贼公会的所在地：暗影盗贼。沃特德普的领主们粉碎了这个公会，迫使其领导人逃离城市（该组织仍然在安恩开展活动）。在沃特德普仍然有盗贼甚至刺客，但是他们被分成无数的小团体或者单独行动。",
	"The most common respite for such robbers is what they call the Honest Trade—adventuring, where roguish abilities may be used without censure and are later lionized in song and legend. Many thieves take to this life, adhering to a code that keeps them out of trouble in civilized areas but still keeps them rich; they vow to burglarize ancient tombs and monstrous lairs instead of the homes and businesses of the wealthy in civilized lands.": "这种强盗最常见的喘息机会是他们所谓的诚实贸易--冒险，在那里可以不受谴责地使用流氓的能力，并在后来的歌曲和传说中得到颂扬。许多盗贼过着这样的生活，他们遵守一种准则，使他们在文明地区不惹麻烦，但仍能保持富有；他们发誓要盗窃古墓和怪物的巢穴，而不是文明地区富人的家和企业。",
	"Some rogues have learned it is easier to pick someone's pocket when you have a royal writ, which is to say many rogues are diplomats, courtiers, influence-peddlers, and information-brokers, in addition to the better-known thieves and assassins. Such rogues blend more easily into civilized society, more often acting as grease in the wheels than a wrench in the works.": "一些流氓已经知道，当你有皇室令状的时候，扒别人的口袋更容易，也就是说，许多流氓是外交官、朝臣、影响力贩子和信息经纪人，除了更知名的盗贼和刺客之外。这样的流氓更容易融入文明社会，更经常作为车轮上的油脂而不是工作中的扳手。",

	"The Weave of magic infuses every part of the Realms, and some people have the natural ability to perceive, touch, and shape the Weave. Some inherit this ability from a magical ancestor such as a dragon or an angel, others gain it by accident from exposure to wild magical power, and others manifest this power by chance or the hand of fate, perhaps portended by events at their conception or birth.": "魔法之网充斥着王国的每一部分，有些人天生就有能力感知、触摸和塑造魔法之网。有些人从龙或天使等魔法祖先那里继承了这种能力，有些人因接触到野生魔法力量而意外获得这种能力，有些人则因偶然或命运之手表现出这种能力，也许是在他们受孕或出生时的事件预示的。",
	"Due to their varied origins and delayed manifestation of powers, sorcerers can be found almost anywhere and among almost any people. Larger cities on the Sword Coast—including Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter, and Waterdeep—all have a few sorcerers, since people with magic gravitate to places where their abilities are valued. Sorcerers are slightly more common among cultures steeped in magic, such as among the elves of Evermeet and the humans of Halruua. The witches of Rashemen are sorcerers who lead that country's society, but their Thayan neighbors often persecute the sorcerers who appear in Thay, seeing sorcery as a threat to the nation's power structure, which is based on the study of wizardry. Magic-hating cultures, such as the Northlanders and Uthgardt, exile or kill the sorcerers who manifest among them.": "由于他们不同的起源和延迟的力量表现，巫师几乎可以在任何地方和任何人群中找到。剑海岸的大型城市--包括博德之门（Baldur's Gate）、永夜（Neverwinter）和水底（Waterdeep）--都有一些巫师，因为拥有魔法的人都倾向于去那些重视他们能力的地方。巫师在深受魔法影响的文化中稍显普遍，例如在埃弗梅特的精灵和哈尔鲁亚的人类中。拉西门的巫师是领导该国社会的巫师，但他们的泰安邻居经常迫害出现在泰伊的巫师，认为巫术是对国家权力结构的威胁，而国家的权力结构是建立在对巫术的研究之上的。憎恨魔法的文化，如Northlanders和Uthgardt，流放或杀害在他们中间显现的巫师。",
	"The Forgotten Realms has a long history of magical disasters and uncontrolled surges of power that alter creatures or the land itself. Whether caused by a Netherese wizard trying to become god of magic, deities being forced to walk the earth during the Time of Troubles, or the chaos of the Spellplague, the magical chaos unleashed by such events has created a legacy of wild magic sorcerers. This legacy often lies dormant for generations, then suddenly manifests under the right (or wrong) circumstances. These wild mages are more common recently in lands directly affected by the Spellplague, including Halruaa, Mulhorand, and pockets of Cormyr and the Sword Coast.": "被遗忘的王国有着悠久的历史，魔法灾难和不受控制的力量涌动改变了生物或土地本身。无论是尼瑟斯巫师试图成为魔法之神，还是在动乱时期神灵被迫在地球上行走，或者是法术瘟疫的混乱，这些事件所释放的魔法混乱都造就了野生魔法师的遗产。这种遗产往往沉睡了几代人，然后在正确（或错误）的情况下突然表现出来。这些野性法师最近在直接受到法术瘟疫影响的土地上比较常见，包括哈尔鲁阿、穆尔霍兰，以及科米尔和剑海岸的部分地区。",
	"Dragons are known to take humanoid form and live among lesser creatures for decades. Some of these dragons have liaisons with humanoids, or invest their allies or minions with dragon magic. These invested creatures might become draconic bloodline sorcerers, or pass their abilities on to their descendants. Draconic bloodline sorcerers have appeared in most parts of the world due to the actions of individual dragons or experimentation by dragon cults, but they are significantly more common around Chessenta, which was once ruled by a dragon, and the land of Murghôm near Thay, where dragon princes have ruled for the last eighty years.": "众所周知，龙会变成人形，并在较小的生物中生活几十年。其中一些龙与人形生物有联系，或者给他们的盟友或奴仆注入龙的魔法。这些被投资的生物可能会成为龙族血统的巫师，或者将他们的能力传给他们的后代。由于个别龙的行为或龙教的实验，龙族血脉巫师已经出现在世界大部分地区，但他们在曾经被龙统治的Chessenta和Thay附近的Murghôm土地上明显更常见，在过去的80年里，龙族王子一直统治着这里。",
	"During the Sundering, a constant storm called the Great Rain covered the Sea of Fallen Stars, darkening the skies and causing massive floods. Thousands of people died from drowning, lightning strikes, or bursts of wind that hit like fists and capsized ships. A few survivors of these events found themselves blessed or cursed with innate magic—storm sorcerers able to bend lightning, thunder, and wind to their will. Most of these new mages appeared near the Inner Sea, but clouds from the Great Rain sometimes traveled much farther away. Although not all storm sorcerers gained their powers from the Great Rain, most common folk associate them with its destructive weather and treat them with caution.": "在毁灭期间，一场名为大雨的持续风暴覆盖了堕落星海，使天空变暗，并导致大规模的洪水。数以千计的人死于溺水、雷击，或像拳头一样击中船只的突发风。这些事件中的少数幸存者发现自己被祝福或被诅咒，拥有与生俱来的魔力--风暴巫师，能够按照自己的意愿弯曲闪电、雷霆和风。这些新法师大多出现在内海附近，但来自大雨的云彩有时会飞到更远的地方。虽然不是所有的风暴巫师都从大雨中获得了他们的力量，但大多数普通人都将他们与大雨的破坏性天气联系在一起，并谨慎对待他们。",
	"The common folk of Faerûn often make little distinction between sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards. Most mages see little point in kindling rivalries with other types of arcane spellcasters—magic is magic, regardless of the means—and for the most part, sorcerers, wizards, and warlocks respect each other as fellow practitioners of the Art, understanding the power it represents.": "法鲁恩的普通民众通常对巫师、术士和魔法师没有什么区别。大多数法师认为与其他类型的奥术施法者之间的竞争没有什么意义--魔法就是魔法，不管是什么手段--在大多数情况下，巫师、魔法师和术士互相尊重，把对方当作艺术的同道中人，理解其代表的力量。",

	"Given their dealings with often sinister otherworldly patrons in exchange for power, warlocks don't have a sterling reputation in the Realms. Even well-meaning warlocks are viewed with suspicion and justifiable caution. Some wizards feel the very existence of warlocks taints the view of their noble Art and causes the common folk to view all practitioners of magic with doubt.": "鉴于他们与往往是险恶的另一个世界的赞助人打交道以换取权力，术士们在王国中并没有一个良好的声誉。即使是善意的术士也会被怀疑和有理由的谨慎对待。一些巫师认为术士的存在玷污了他们高尚的艺术观，并导致普通人对所有魔法从业者产生怀疑。",
	"Some warlocks, particularly those of fey or fiendish bloodlines, are born with a propensity for their power, drawing the attention of potential patrons even from childhood. Others seek out a pact, sometimes because they can't find the power they desire elsewhere. Some warlocks forge multiple pacts, although they must eventually come to favor one over the others, as their patrons are jealous and possessive beings.": "有些术士，特别是那些拥有精灵或魔鬼血统的术士，天生就有一种对其力量的倾向，甚至从童年就吸引了潜在赞助人的注意。其他人则寻求契约，有时是因为他们无法在其他地方找到他们渴望的力量。有些术士缔结了多个契约，尽管他们最终必须偏向于其中一个，因为他们的赞助人是嫉妒和占有欲很强的人。",
	"The gods are far from the only forces at work in the Realms, and ambitious warlocks have many potential patrons able to offer them arcane power.": "诸神远不是在王国中工作的唯一力量，雄心勃勃的术士有许多潜在的赞助人能够为他们提供神秘的力量。",
	"In the vast wilderness of the Realms one can still find connections to the Feywild. These are fey crossings, places of mysterious natural beauty in the world that have a near-perfect mirror in the Feywild. You can pass through a fey crossing by entering a clearing, passing through the surface of a pool, stepping into a circle of mushrooms, or crawling under the trunk of a tree. A few warlocks seek out such places to bargain with the Archfey of that realm for power. Noteworthy Archfey patrons include the following: {@b Titania,} the Summer Queen, is perhaps the mightiest of the archfey. With a smile, she can ripen a crop, and with a frown, summon wildfires. She rules the seelie of the Summer Court. {@b Oberon,} the Green Lord, an unrivaled hunter and woodland warrior, is Titania's lover and frequently her foe. Oberon is attuned to every bough of each tree and each branch of every stream in the forests of the Feywild. If Oberon has a weakness, it is the wild nature of his heart. His mood swings like a weather vane in a wind storm. {@b Hyrsam,} the Prince of Fools, is thought to be the first satyr. He can sing the shine off gold, and his jokes and antics can cause stones to cry with laughter. Yet Hyrsam is also the soul of savagery and the wild. Hyrsam the Fool is a prankster and prone to mischief, but when such jokes turn vicious and deadly, Hyrsam the Savage is at play. {@b The Queen of Air and Darkness} rules the unseelie of the Gloaming Court from an onyx throne that sits empty except for the hovering Night Diamond, a black gem the size of a human head that dully glimmers with captured stars. The Queen of Air and Darkness is an invisible presence around it, her voice thundering from the Night Diamond or whispering secrets directly in the ears of her courtiers, and sometimes both at once. {@b The Prince of Frost} was once known as the Sun Prince, but his heart grew cold when his betrothed betrayed him and escaped, her soul becoming one of the stars. Ever since, the wrathful prince has sought to reunite with his betrothed whenever she is reincarnated in mortal form.": "在王国的广阔荒野中，人们仍然可以找到与Feywild的联系。这些都是精灵的交叉点，是世界上具有神秘自然之美的地方，在精灵世界里有一个近乎完美的镜像。你可以通过进入一片空地，穿过水池的表面，踏入一圈蘑菇，或者爬到树干下，来通过一个妖怪通道。少数术士会寻找这样的地方，与该领域的大法师讨价还价，以获取权力。值得注意的大法师赞助人包括以下几位。{@b Titania,}夏日女王，可能是最强大的大法师。她只要一笑，就能使庄稼成熟，只要一皱眉，就能召唤野火。她统治着夏日宫廷的海族人。(绿主，一个无与伦比的猎人和林地战士，是泰坦尼亚的情人，也经常是她的敌人。奥伯伦对仙境森林中的每棵树的每根枝桠和每条溪流的每根树枝都很熟悉。如果说奥伯伦有什么弱点，那就是他内心的野性。他的情绪波动就像暴风中的风向标。愚人王子{@b Hyrsam,}，被认为是第一个萨提尔。他能唱出黄金的光泽，他的笑话和滑稽动作能使石头笑得流泪。然而，Hyrsam也是野蛮人和野性的灵魂。傻瓜Hyrsam是一个恶作剧者，容易搞恶作剧，但当这种玩笑变成恶毒和致命的时候，野蛮人Hyrsam就会发挥作用。{@b The Queen of Air and Darkness}在一个玛瑙宝座上统治着阴暗宫廷的非精灵，宝座上除了盘旋的夜之钻石外空无一物，那是一颗人头大小的黑色宝石，闪烁着捕捉到的星星的光芒。空气和黑暗的女王在它周围是一个无形的存在，她的声音从夜之钻石中发出雷鸣般的声音，或者直接在她的朝臣耳边低语秘密，有时两者同时出现。{@b The Prince of Frost}曾经被称为太阳王子，但当他的未婚妻背叛了他并逃跑，她的灵魂成为星星之一时，他的心变得很冷。从那时起，每当他的未婚妻以凡人的形式转世时，这位愤怒的王子就会寻求与她重聚。",

	"The first hilt parried a clumsy axe swing and caught the rhythm of the wizard's spell. It was one with which he was well familiar. Using his free hand, the bladesinger mirrored his opponent's casting then sent his considerable power out to surround the overmatched wizard, binding it to himself. Argent energy flew from the human's outstretched hand only to fizzle into nothingness as the bladesinger quenched the spell.": "第一个刀柄抵挡住了一个笨拙的斧头挥舞，抓住了巫师的咒语节奏。这是他非常熟悉的一个。用他的空闲的手，刀锋战士反映了他的对手的施法，然后把他的相当大的力量发出来，包围了这个过于强大的巫师，把它绑在自己身上。阿根廷的能量从人类伸出的手中飞出，但在刀锋战士熄灭咒语的时候，却消失得无影无踪了。",
	"Scholars and practitioners of what they call \"the Art\" (see chapter 1 for details), wizards are the most disciplined spellcasters in the Forgotten Realms. They need to be, as their powers come from years of careful study and practice. Some wizards apprentice and study with an experienced master, while others attend formal academies or universities of wizardry, such as those in Evermeet or Halruaa, or in the great cities of the North like Waterdeep or Silverymoon.": "巫师是所谓 \"艺术 \"的学者和实践者（详见第一章），他们是被遗忘的王国中最有纪律的施法者。他们需要如此，因为他们的力量来自于多年的仔细研究和实践。有些巫师是学徒，跟着有经验的大师学习，有些则是在正规的巫师学院或大学学习，比如在Evermeet或Halruaa，或者在北方的大城市，如Waterdeep或Silverymoon。",
	"With the intensity of their study and practice, wizards tend to become increasingly solitary as they advance in their Art, having fewer peers with whom they can share their insights, if they choose to share them with anyone at all. Thus great wizards often take up residence in isolated towers or strongholds, exhibiting ever more eccentric behavior as time goes on. Some say this is a mark of madness brought on by delving too deeply into arcane lore, but they never say it too loudly anywhere a wizard might overhear.": "由于学习和实践的强度，巫师们在艺术上的进步往往会变得越来越孤独，如果他们选择与任何人分享他们的见解，他们可以与之分享的同行也越来越少。因此，伟大的巫师经常居住在与世隔绝的塔楼或据点，随着时间的推移，表现出越来越古怪的行为。有人说这是对奥秘传说钻研太深所带来的疯狂的标志，但他们从不在可能被巫师听到的地方太大声地说出来。",
	"The greatest wizards of the Realms find means of extending their lives far beyond the span of any race except the elves. Archwizards may be centuries old, having seen civilizations rise and fall across Faerûn. Other wizards seeking this longevity turn to lichdom, dwelling in isolated tombs and strongholds as they withdraw from the world in body as well as mind.": "王国中最伟大的巫师找到了延长自己生命的方法，远远超过了除精灵以外的任何种族的寿命。大巫师们可能已经有几个世纪的历史了，他们见证了整个法鲁恩文明的兴衰。其他寻求这种长寿的巫师则转而从事巫术，居住在与世隔绝的墓穴和据点中，在身体和精神上都远离世界。",
	"Many wizardly groups exist in the Forgotten Realms, but two, in particular, stand out.": "在被遗忘的领域存在许多巫师团体，但有两个团体特别突出。",
	"The most infamous group of wizards in the Realms are the Red Wizards of Thay. Garbed in their distinctive red robes, the Red Wizards have sought to expand their power and to extend Thay's influence across the Realms, particularly in lands in the East. They shave their heads and wear complex tattoos reflecting their ambitions and achievements and their favored school of magic.": "王国中最臭名昭著的巫师团体是泰伊的红袍巫师。身着独特的红袍，红袍巫师们试图扩大他们的权力，并将泰伊的影响扩大到整个王国，特别是在东方的土地。他们剃光头，身上有复杂的纹身，反映出他们的野心和成就以及他们所喜爱的魔法流派。",
	"In Thay, the Red Wizards have ultimate power, although they give governance of day-to-day affairs to those without skill in the Art. Every Red Wizard devotes study to one of the eight schools of magic and serves that school's zulkir, the leader and ultimate master of that style of magic. The zulkirs and their underlings constantly vie with one another for power and influence, and this competition frequently sends Red Wizards far from Thay to seek new spells, recover lost artifacts, and create wealth that can flow back to Thay. The power the Red Wizards hold in Thay gives them a measure of diplomatic legitimacy in the lands of the Sword Coast and the North, but their presence is rarely welcome and is universally viewed with suspicion.": "在泰伊，红袍巫师拥有最终的权力，尽管他们把日常事务交给那些不懂艺术的人管理。每个红袍巫师都致力于研究八大魔法流派之一，并为该流派的祖尔基尔服务，祖尔基尔是该魔法风格的领导者和终极大师。祖尔基尔和他们的下属不断地相互争夺权力和影响力，这种竞争经常把红袍巫师送到远离泰伊的地方去寻找新的法术，找回丢失的神器，并创造财富，使之流回泰伊。红袍巫师在泰伊拥有的权力使他们在剑海岸和北方的土地上具有一定的外交合法性，但他们的存在很少受到欢迎，而且普遍受到怀疑。",
	"The potential for wizards to influence the outcome of battle is something no ruler in Faerûn can afford to ignore, and most great armies seek to recruit and include wizards among their ranks.

Still, all schools of magic find their applications in warfare.": "法鲁恩的任何统治者都不能忽视巫师影响战斗结果的潜力，大多数伟大的军队都试图招募巫师并将其纳入队伍。唤醒者是最常见的，仅仅是因为他们的法术有可能对最多的敌人造成最大的伤害。不过，所有的魔法流派都能在战争中找到自己的应用。",
	"The War Wizards of Cormyr are perhaps the best known application of the Art to the field of battle. As much soldiers as they are scholars, many of them were members of the Purple Dragons before they began their training in the Art. In addition to field duty in times of war, the War Wizards also protect the royalty of Cormyr, and each one swears a magic oath of service to the Crown. In this role, War Wizards serve as bodyguards, advisors, and even spies. Members of the royal family, Purple Dragon Knights, and officers of the Purple Dragons frequently wear magic rings that allow a War Wizards to know where they've gone and to scry upon them. Removing such a ring, even for innocent reasons, can call a cadre of battle-ready War Wizards to teleport nearby with attack spells already in the midst of being cast.": "科米尔的战争巫师也许是最著名的艺术在战场上的应用。他们既是士兵又是学者，其中许多人在开始接受艺术训练之前就是紫龙会的成员。除了在战争时期的战场职责外，战争巫师还保护科米尔的皇室，每个人都宣誓为皇室服务的魔法誓言。在这个角色中，战争巫师充当保镖、顾问，甚至是间谍。王室成员、紫龙骑士和紫龙军官经常戴着魔法戒指，让战争巫师知道他们去了哪里并对他们进行侦查。摘下这样的戒指，即使是出于无辜的原因，也可以召唤一队准备好的战地魔法师传送到附近，并且已经开始施展攻击法术了。",
	"Wizards and many other arcane spellcasters develop a signature rune, which they use to identify their belongings, sign as their name, and warn others. As a mage gains in power, more individuals recognize the sigil and connect it with a mighty spellcaster, not to be trifled with. Some mage sigils are used in conjunction with spells such as glyph of warding, which enforces the tendency of ordinary people to shy away from items marked by such sigils. There are folktales, in fact, about the gods themselves punishing a person who misuse's a wizard's sigil—preposterous tales that were most likely started by wizards themselves. There is no set penalty for violating another mage's signature sigil or using it without permission. Powerful mages tend to punish such activity themselves to discourage further use.": "巫师和许多其他奥术施法者都会开发一个签名符文，他们用它来识别自己的物品，作为自己的名字签名，并警告他人。随着法师力量的增强，更多的人认识到这一符文，并将其与一个强大的施法者联系在一起，不可轻视。一些法师的符号与护身符等法术结合使用，这使得普通人倾向于避开带有此类符号的物品。事实上，有一些民间故事是关于神明亲自惩罚滥用巫师符号的人的--这些荒谬的故事很可能是由巫师自己发起的。侵犯其他法师的签名符号或未经许可使用它并没有固定的惩罚。强大的法师往往会自己惩罚这种活动，以阻止进一步使用。",
	"Apprentice wizards in Faerûn are reminded of the dangers of misusing another spellcaster's sigil by a rhyme: \"Whenever magic one doth weave / 'Tis never, ever, wise to deceive.\"": "法鲁恩的巫师学徒们通过一首儿歌提醒误用另一个施法者的标志的危险。\"无论何时施展魔法/欺骗永远是不明智的\"。",

	"From its inception as a martial and magical art, Bladesinging has been tied to the sword, more specifically the longsword. Yet many generations of study gave rise to various styles of Bladesinging based on the melee weapon employed. The techniques of these styles are passed from master to students in small schools, some of which have a building dedicated to instruction. Even the newest styles are hundreds of years old, but are still taught by their original creators due to the long lives of elves. Most schools of Bladesinging are in Evermeet or Evereska. One was started in Myth Drannor, but the city's destruction has scattered those students who survived.": "从一开始作为一种武术和魔法艺术，刀术就与剑联系在一起，更确切地说，是长剑。然而，经过几代人的研究，根据所使用的近战武器，产生了各种风格的Bladesing。这些风格的技术在小学校里从师傅传给学生，其中一些学校有专门的教学楼。即使是最新的风格也有几百年的历史，但由于精灵的长寿，他们仍然由最初的创造者教授。大多数刀术学校都在Evermeet或Evereska。有一所是在神话Drannor开始的，但城市的毁灭使那些幸存的学生分散了。",
	"Styles of Bladesinging are broadly categorized based on the type of weapon employed, and each is associated with a category of animal. Within that style are specializations named after specific animal types, based on the types of spells employed, the techniques of the master, and the particular weapon used. Bladesingers who apprentice to a master typically get a tattoo of their chosen style's animal. Some bladesingers learn multiple styles and bear many tattoos, wearing a warning on their skin of their deadly skills.": "刀术的风格根据所使用的武器类型进行了广泛的分类，每种风格都与一类动物有关。在这种风格中，根据所使用的法术类型、大师的技术和所使用的特定武器，有以特定动物类型命名的专业。拜师学艺的刀客通常会得到一个他们所选风格的动物纹身。有些刀客学习多种风格，并拥有许多纹身，在他们的皮肤上佩戴着他们致命技能的警告。",
	"Styles that employ a sword belong to this family. The lion style, the eldest, trains practitioners in the use of the longsword and doesn't favor any particular type of spells. Leopard style focuses on the shortsword and spells of illusion and stealth. Red tiger, a style just three centuries old, has its bladesingers using the scimitar in a whirling dance of defense from which they launch into sudden leaps and attacks.": "使用剑的风格属于这个家族。狮子式，是最古老的，训练练习者使用长剑，不偏爱任何特定类型的法术。豹式专注于短剑以及幻术和隐身术的法术。红虎式是一个只有三个世纪历史的流派，它的刀手使用弯刀进行旋转式防御，并从中发起突然的跳跃和攻击。",
	"Styles that focus on the use of a hafted weapon, such as an axe or hammer, have been grouped together as bird styles, yet they vary wildly. All relatively new styles, they use weapons not typically favored by elves. Eagle-style bladesingers use small handaxes, and many maneuvers in the style focus on fluid ways to throw the weapon and draw a new one. Raven style uses a pick, and spells associated with it grant the bladesinger more agility in combat.": "注重使用斧头武器的风格，如斧头或锤子，被归为鸟类风格，但它们的差异很大。所有相对较新的风格，它们使用的武器通常不受精灵的青睐。鹰式刀客使用小手斧，该风格中的许多演习都集中在扔出武器和抽出新武器的流畅方式上。乌鸦式使用镐，与之相关的法术赋予刀锋战士在战斗中更多的敏捷性。",
	"Practitioners of these styles use a flail, chain, or whip. Viper style uses a whip, despite its inelegance as a weapon, and has almost as long a history as the lion style. Its masters punctuate their bladesong with a stunningly rapid rhythm of whip cracks, which can keep many foes at bay and allow the bladesinger space to cast the cruel spells of poison and disease favored by the style.": "这些风格的练习者使用连枷、链条或鞭子。蝰蛇式使用鞭子，尽管它作为一种武器并不优雅，而且几乎和狮子式一样有着悠久的历史。它的主人用令人惊叹的快速的鞭子抽打节奏来点缀他们的剑鸣，这可以让许多敌人不敢轻举妄动，让剑客有空间施展该风格所喜爱的残酷的毒药和疾病法术。",
	"Practitioners of the Art have developed the following cantrips for those who favor casting spells in melee. War Wizards of Cormyr, bladesingers, and warlocks of the Pact of the Blade are especially fond of these spells.": "艺术的实践者们为那些喜欢在近战中施法的人开发了以下咒语。科米尔的战争巫师、刀锋战士和刀锋契约的术士尤其喜欢这些法术。",
	"These cantrips are on the sorcerer, warlock, and wizard spell lists.": "这些咒语都在巫师、术士和魔法师的法术列表中。",
	"The backgrounds described in the Player's Handbook are all found in Faerûn's various societies, in some form or another. This chapter offers additional backgrounds for characters in a Forgotten Realms campaign, many of them specific to Faerûn or to the Sword Coast and the North in particular.": "玩家手册中描述的背景都以某种形式出现在Faerûn的各种社会中。本章为被遗忘的王国战役中的角色提供了额外的背景，其中许多是法鲁恩或剑海岸和北方的特有背景。",
	"As in the Player's Handbook, each of the backgrounds presented here provides proficiencies, languages, and equipment, as well as a background feature and sometimes a variant form. For personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws, most of the backgrounds in this chapter use a thematically similar background in the Player's Handbook as their foundation.": "和《玩家手册》一样，这里介绍的每个背景都提供了熟练度、语言和装备，以及一个背景特征，有时还提供了一个变体形式。对于个性特征、理想、纽带和缺陷，本章中的大多数背景都以《玩家手册》中主题类似的背景为基础。",
	"Torm is seen as the good right hand of Tyr, and as such his symbol is a white gauntlet made for the right hand. It represents Tyr's sword hand, but it is also a symbol of forbearance. Torm is frequently depicted with his right gauntlet extended palm forward, which worshipers call the Hand Resolute. It signifies the principle that the just and true must pause before acting to judge whether their intentions uphold Torm's ideals. Temples, civic structures, and the homes of the faithful are often decorated with images of the Hand Resolute as a constant reminder of this principle.": "托尔姆被看作是泰尔的好右手，因此他的象征是为右手制作的白色铠甲。它代表泰尔的剑手，但也是宽容的象征。托尔姆经常被描绘成右臂向前伸出的手掌，崇拜者称之为 \"坚定之手\"。它象征着这样一个原则：公正和真实的人在行动之前必须暂停，以判断他们的意图是否符合托尔姆的理想。寺庙、市政建筑和信徒的家中经常装饰着坚决之手的图像，以不断提醒人们注意这一原则。",
	"Numerous fiends forge pacts with mortal warlocks in the Realms—so many that warlocks are almost synonymous with infernal power in Faerûn. These fiends include the Archdevils of the Nine Hells and their most powerful dukes, the Demon Lords of the Abyss, and the ultroloths who rule over yugoloth armies. Such deals need not be struck directly with the power in question, however. Often a weaker fiend serves as an intermediary, and the warlock might not know whom he or she serves. Notable fiendish patrons peculiar to the Forgotten Realms include the following: {@b Baazka} is the pit fiend behind the most recent incursion of infernal forces from Dragonspear Castle. Its plans for the Sword Coast were thwarted along with those of allied Red Wizards, but its ambitions in the region remain. {@b Belaphoss} is a demon that serves Demogorgon. It considers itself the greatest servitor of the Prince of Demons and thus a rival for Demogorgon's power. {@b Eltab} was once bound beneath the city of Eltabbar in Thay, caged even by the layout of the city's streets and canals, which formed a glyph of imprisonment. The demon is now loose in the world, seeking revenge. {@b Errtu} the balor has plagued Drizzt Do'Urden for more than a century, largely over possession of an artifact called the Crenshinibon. Having lost the last battle and been banished from the world, the balor now seeks indirect means of revenge. {@b Gargauth} is a mysterious infernal power who seeks godhood while trapped in the world within a magical shield. {@b Lorcan} is a {@creature cambion} who collects warlocks like one might collect butterflies. His favorite collection, the Troil Thirteen, includes warlocks of blood descent from the thirteen who first made a pact with Asmodeus. {@b Malkizid} is a solar who fell from grace when he betrayed the Seldarine. Ever since then, Malkizid has delighted in every wrong he can do to elves, but he gains the greatest pleasure when he manipulates the elves into harming each other. {@b Wendonai} is the balor lord who first tempted the dark elves to summon demons in the ancient wars between the elf peoples. It also turned them to the worship of Lolth and continued to advise and tutor them for long after the Descent.": "众多恶魔与王国中的凡人术士签订了契约，以至于术士在法鲁恩几乎成了地狱力量的代名词。这些恶魔包括九层地狱的大恶魔和他们最强大的公爵，深渊的恶魔领主，以及统治yugoloth军队的ultroloths。然而，这种交易不需要直接与有关的势力达成。通常情况下，一个较弱的恶魔作为中间人，而术士可能不知道他或她为谁服务。在被遗忘的王国中，著名的恶魔赞助人包括以下几种。{@b Baazka}是最近从龙矛城堡入侵的地狱力量背后的坑道恶魔。它在剑海岸的计划与红袍巫师联盟的计划一起被挫败了，但它在该地区的野心依然存在。{@b Belaphoss}是一个为德摩根服务的恶魔。它认为自己是恶魔王子最伟大的仆人，因此是德摩根权力的对手。{@b Eltab}曾经被束缚在泰伊的艾尔塔巴城下，甚至被城市的街道和运河的布局所笼罩，形成了一个囚禁的字形。这个恶魔现在在这个世界上被释放，寻求复仇。{@b Errtu}巴洛尔困扰了德里兹-多乌尔登一个多世纪，主要是为了争夺一件名为克伦希尼邦的神器。在输掉最后一场战斗并被放逐出世界后，巴洛尔现在寻求间接的复仇手段。{@b Gargauth}是一个神秘的地狱力量，他寻求成神，同时被困在世界的一个魔法盾牌中。{@b Lorcan}是一个收集术士的{@creature cambion}，就像收集蝴蝶一样。他最喜欢的收藏品--特罗尔十三人组，包括与阿斯莫德第一次达成协议的十三人组的血统术士。{@b Malkizid}是一个在背叛塞尔达林时落马的太阳。从那时起，马尔基兹德就以他能对精灵做的每一件错事为乐，但当他操纵精灵们互相伤害时，他获得了最大的快乐。{@b Wendonai}是巴洛尔领主，在古代精灵民族之间的战争中，他第一次引诱黑暗精灵召唤恶魔。它还使他们转向对洛尔思的崇拜，并在降世之后的很长一段时间里继续为他们提供建议和指导。",
	"More than a dozen settlements pay homage to the king in Gundbarg. They profit from the island's reputation as a safe stopover. Though Gundarlun might not provide the best seaworthy warriors, nevertheless ships that are looking to make repairs, take on sailors or sail-menders, or store large cargoes are likely to find their needs met here.": "在贡德巴格有十多个定居点向国王致敬。他们从该岛作为安全中转站的声誉中获益。虽然贡达伦可能不会提供最好的适航战士，但那些想要进行维修、招募水手或补水员、或储存大量货物的船只很可能会在这里找到他们的需求。"
