{
	"This is a pretty special installment of the Plane Shift series for me, because I was the creative lead for Ixalan world building. Perhaps betraying my fourteen-year history working on Dungeons & Dragons, Ixalan is a world of exploration and treasure, marked by ancient sites waiting to be explored by intrepid heroes. One of those sites, shown on a card in the Ixalan set, is obviously inspired by a classic D&D adventure, The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan. This plane lacks only dragons to be a fully realized D&D milieu—there's even a world map! Ultimately, that means that writing Plane Shift: Ixalan was both a ton of fun and relatively easy. The people who populate Ixalan have a lot in common with D&D characters already, and mapping them to existing classes and backgrounds was a pretty straightforward task. Similarly, the creatures of the plane—especially the dinosaurs—had a lot of analogues in the game already. And still, this is the longest installment of Plane Shift yet! That's partly because I had the freedom to really cut loose on ideas and inspiration to help you play a character in this exciting world. You'll find more tables in here than ever before—tables of personality traits and ideals to flesh out your character, of treasures to flavor your hoards, and inspiration to bring your party together. This sort of thing is both really enjoyable and really challenging to write—a lot like the flavor text on Magic cards, actually, because each one is a self-contained nugget, a complete idea in a single sentence. I hope that all this stuff enriches your game. The appendix in this document is an extended musing on the colors of Magic and their relationship to D&D characters and spells. This is the sort of thing that dominates a lot of lunchtime conversations with members of the Magic creative team who are also avid D&D fans, and also the sort of thing I get a lot of questions about on Twitter. As with much of the rest of this document, the focus is more on roleplaying and character building than on rules. It's a first stab, though, toward a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the worlds of both games. As always, The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Ixalan is the definitive resource for information about the plane. With this document, you can use that information to build a campaign with a minimum of changes to the fifth edition D&D rules, which you can find here. And even without the book, you can find lore about Ixalan on the Magic web site. There's a lot of open space on that map. I hope you have fun exploring the world of Ixalan!": "对我来说，这是一个相当特别的 \"位面转移 \"系列，因为我是伊克萨兰世界建设的创意负责人。也许是背叛了我在《龙与地下城》工作的14年历史，艾克萨兰是一个探索和宝藏的世界，有许多古老的遗址等待着无畏的英雄们去探索。其中一个地点，显示在艾克萨兰套装的卡片上，显然是受到D&D经典冒险的启发，塔莫阿坎的隐秘神殿。这个位面只需要龙就可以成为一个完整的D&D环境--甚至还有一个世界地图 归根结底，这意味着编写《星球转移》。伊萨兰》既充满乐趣，又相对容易。Ixalan的居民与D&D的角色有很多共同点，将他们与现有的类别和背景进行映射是一项非常简单的任务。同样地，飞机上的生物--尤其是恐龙--在游戏中已经有很多类似的东西了。尽管如此，这仍然是《飞机转移》中最长的一期！这部分是因为我有一个很好的机会，让我能够在游戏中找到类似的东西。部分原因是我可以自由地发挥创意和灵感，帮助你在这个令人兴奋的世界中扮演一个角色。你会发现这里有比以往更多的表格--用来充实你的角色的个性特征和理想的表格，用来充实你的囤积物的宝物表格，以及用来将你的队伍团结起来的灵感表格。这种东西写起来既有趣又有挑战性--实际上，这很像魔术卡上的风味文字，因为每张卡都是一个自成一体的小块，一个完整的想法在一句话里。我希望所有这些东西都能丰富你的游戏。本文件的附录是对魔法的颜色及其与D&D角色和法术的关系的延伸思考。这是在午餐时间与同时也是狂热的D&D粉丝的《魔法》创作团队成员的谈话中占主导地位的那种东西，也是我在Twitter上收到的很多问题的那种东西。就像本文件的大部分内容一样，重点在于角色扮演和角色塑造，而不是规则。但这是对这两个游戏的世界之间的关系的更全面的理解的第一次尝试。一如既往，《魔法：集会-艾克萨兰的艺术》是关于这个平面的权威信息资源。有了这份文件，你就可以利用这些信息来建立一个对第五版D&D规则进行最少改动的战役，你可以在这里找到这些规则。即使没有这本书，你也可以在魔法网站上找到关于伊萨兰的传说。那张地图上有很多开放的空间。我希望你在探索伊克萨兰世界的过程中能获得乐趣!",
	"The Sun Empire is a powerful civilization that dominates the eastern coast of Ixalan. The empire's fierce warriors are supported by priests who wield the power of the sun and command the mighty dinosaurs that inhabit the continent. A new ruler has brought the empire into an era of expansion, seeking to reclaim the lands in the continent's interior that it once held. At the same time, a foreign incursion into those same lands sparks a search for the artifact known as the Immortal Sun, which the people of the empire view as a potent symbol of their identity.": "太阳帝国是一个强大的文明，统治着伊萨兰的东海岸。帝国凶猛的战士们得到了祭司的支持，他们挥舞着太阳的力量，指挥着居住在大陆上的强大的恐龙。一位新的统治者将帝国带入了一个扩张的时代，试图夺回它曾经拥有的大陆内部的土地。与此同时，外国对这些土地的入侵引发了对被称为不朽太阳的文物的搜寻，帝国的人民将其视为他们身份的有力象征。",
	"Consider the following class options for your Sun Empire character.": "考虑为你的太阳帝国角色提供以下等级选择。",
	"Certain warriors devoted to Tilonalli (the destructive aspect of the Threefold Sun—the deity worshiped by the folk of the empire) enter a berserk rage in combat. The Path of the Berserker is appropriate for these characters, or the Path of the Totem Warrior (replacing bear, eagle, and wolf totem spirits with ceratops, aerosaur, and raptor spirits, respectively).": "某些献身于蒂罗纳利（Threefold Sun的破坏性方面--帝国人民崇拜的神灵）的战士在战斗中进入狂暴状态。狂暴者之路适合这些角色，或者图腾战士之路（分别用角龙、气龙和猛禽的精神取代熊、鹰和狼的图腾精神）。",
	"Poetry is a respected art among the warriors of the Sun Empire, so bards of the College of Valor might be found within their ranks.": "诗歌在太阳帝国的战士中是一种受人尊敬的艺术，所以在他们的队伍中可能会发现英勇学院的吟游诗人。",
	"Certain shamans of the Sun Empire are closely attuned to the forces of nature, and use wild shape to take on dinosaur forms. These druids typically follow the Circle of the Moon.": "太阳帝国的某些巫师与自然界的力量密切相关，并利用野生形状化身为恐龙形态。这些德鲁伊通常遵循 \"月之环\"。",
	"Highly trained soldiers and warriors are the backbone of the Sun Empire. They are typically Battle Masters or Champions.": "训练有素的士兵和战士是太阳帝国的骨干力量。他们通常是战斗大师或冠军。",
	"Scouts of the Sun Empire are often rangers, including both Beast Masters and Hunters. The pteranodon, dimetrodon, and velociraptor are all appropriate ranger's companions.": "太阳帝国的侦察兵通常是游侠，包括野兽大师和猎人。翼龙、迪米特龙和迅猛龙都是合适的游骑兵的伙伴。",
	"The trickiest thing about playing D&D in a highly factionalized setting like Ixalan is bringing player characters together who belong to different groups and would have no obvious reason to want to cooperate—let alone trust each other with their lives. One possibility, of course, is for all the characters to belong to the same faction. An all-vampire party bent on conquest or an all-pirate party set to explore the Stormwreck Sea can find plenty of adventure in Ixalan. But if one player is intent on playing a merfolk and one is determined to be an orc, some extra effort is required to bring them together.": "在Ixalan这样一个高度派系化的环境中玩D&D，最棘手的事情是把属于不同团体的玩家角色聚集在一起，他们没有明显的理由想要合作--更不用说把生命交给对方了。当然，一种可能性是所有角色都属于同一派别。一个一心想要征服的全吸血鬼队伍或一个准备探索风暴残骸海的全海盗队伍可以在伊萨兰找到大量的冒险。但是，如果一个玩家打算扮演人鱼族，而另一个则决心成为兽人，那么就需要付出一些额外的努力来将他们聚在一起。",
	"The most straightforward approach is to put the characters into a situation where they need to work together to survive or to achieve some goal they all share. Necessity makes strange bedfellows, as the saying goes, and characters who find themselves in a bad situation have a strong incentive to put aside their differences and work together, at least until they get out of that situation. They might all be trapped in the same place, or each character could have something that the whole group needs.": "最直接的方法是将人物置于需要合作生存或实现某些共同目标的情况下。俗话说 \"物以类聚，人以群分\"，发现自己处于不利境地的角色有强烈的动机去抛开他们的分歧，一起工作，至少在他们摆脱这种情况之前。他们可能都被困在同一个地方，或者每个角色都可能有整个团体需要的东西。",
	"You can roll on the following table to generate ideas for bringing characters together at the start of the campaign. Ideally, by the time they have overcome whatever circumstance has thrown them together, they will have learned to trust each other and perhaps even become friends.": "你可以在下面的表格中滚动，以产生在活动开始时将角色聚集在一起的想法。理想的情况是，当他们克服了将他们扔在一起的任何情况时，他们已经学会了相互信任，甚至可能成为朋友。",
	"The characters begin the campaign captured, whether as prisoners of the Legion of Dusk, captives in a pirate ship's brig, or trapped in jungle snares.": "活动开始时，角色们都被俘虏了，无论是黄昏军团的囚犯、海盗船上的俘虏，还是被困在丛林的陷阱里。",
	"The characters are fighting each other when a dinosaur attacks.": "角色们正在相互争斗，这时一只恐龙袭击了他们。",
	"The characters are trapped together by a cave-in, a sinkhole opening, or some similar disaster.": "角色们因塌陷、天坑开启或一些类似的灾难而被困在一起。",
	"Each character has one piece of a treasure map, or one key of several required to open a treasure vault.": "每个角色都有一张藏宝图，或者是打开宝库所需的几把钥匙中的一把。",
	"A strange dream leads each of the characters to the same destination.": "一个奇怪的梦将每个人物引向同一个目的地。",
	"The characters are all hopelessly lost in the jungle.": "这些人物都在丛林中无望地迷失了方向。",
	"Leaders of the characters' factions have ordered them to cooperate on a secret mission.": "人物所在派别的领导人命令他们合作完成一项秘密任务。",
	"A pirate captain or other villain is a common enemy to all the characters.": "海盗船长或其他恶棍是所有人物的共同敌人。",
	"A magical or natural phenomenon threatens all folk of Ixalan.": "一个神奇的或自然的现象威胁着伊萨兰的所有居民。",
	"The characters are all trying to avert the catastrophe of a fullscale war among their peoples.": "这些人物都在努力避免他们的民族之间发生全面战争的灾难。",
	"{@b Nation.} The invaders must be driven out and the ancient capital of Orazca reclaimed.": "{@b Nation.}必须赶走入侵者，夺回奥拉兹卡的古都。",
	"{@b Glory.} I wish to earn great glory in battle—ideally, by making my foes surrender.": "{@b Glory.} 我希望在战斗中获得巨大的荣耀--最好是让我的敌人投降。",
	"{@b Poetry.} Beauty is to be found in all things, from creation to destruction, and it should all be recorded in words.": "{@b Poetry.}美可以在所有的事物中找到，从创造到毁灭，都应该用文字来记录。",
	"{@b Zeal.} I am devoted to the Threefold Sun and the commands of the priests.": "{@b Zeal.}我献身于三倍太阳和祭司的命令。",
	"{@b History.} I seek to understand the empire's history so I can better chart a course for its future.": "{@b History.}我寻求了解帝国的历史，以便我可以更好地规划它的未来。",
	"{@b Peace.} I would like to believe that peace can be forged among the peoples of this land.": "{@b Peace.}我愿意相信，这片土地上的人民之间可以形成和平。",
	"I left behind a family (living or dead) when I set out on my journey of exploration.": "当我踏上探索的旅程时，我留下了一个家庭（活着的或死去的）。",
	"I have ties to the imperial line.": "我与帝王线有联系。",
	"I come from a noble family, and have kin who live as hostages in the imperial capital.": "我来自一个贵族家庭，有亲属作为人质生活在帝都。",
	"I have fallen in love with a member of a pirate crew.": "我已经爱上了一个海盗团的成员。",
	"I discovered an ancient ruin in the jungle, but I keep it a secret.": "我在丛林中发现了一个古老的遗迹，但我把它作为一个秘密。",
	"I will one day find the Immortal Sun and restore the empire's ancient glory": "有一天我会找到不朽的太阳，恢复帝国的古老荣耀",
	"Generally, in a D&D campaign, it's a good idea to ensure that all the player characters can understand each other. That's why the game maintains the convenient fiction of a Common tongue. But Ixalan is about the clash of four cultures, so you might want to emphasize the differences among those cultures by making the folk of each speak entirely different languages.": "一般来说，在D&D活动中，确保所有玩家角色都能相互理解是一个好主意。这就是为什么游戏保留了通用语言这一便利的虚构。但伊萨兰是关于四种文化的冲突，所以你可能想通过让每种文化的人民说完全不同的语言来强调这些文化之间的差异。",
	"If you go this route, Merfolk is the language of the River Heralds and Vampire is the language of the Legion of Dusk. The humans of the Sun Empire speak their own language, Itzocan, and the humans of the Brazen Coalition speak a different language—a pidgin of Orc, Siren, and a native human language that is similar to Vampire (about as closely related as Italian is to Spanish). Orcs, sirens, and goblins also speak this Brazen Coalition pidgin.": "如果你走这条路，\"人鱼 \"是 \"河之先驱 \"的语言，吸血鬼是 \"黄昏军团 \"的语言。太阳帝国的人类说他们自己的语言--伊佐坎语（Itzocan），而勇敢联盟的人类则说一种不同的语言--半兽人、海妖和一种类似于吸血鬼的人类母语的混合语言（就像意大利语和西班牙语一样密切相关）。半兽人、海妖和地精也说这种勇敢联盟的混合语言。",
	"You might still wish to admit the existence of a sort of Common—a trade pidgin used in circumstances where members of different peoples do interact with each other. But such a language is almost impossible to use for discussions of matters of any depth.": "你可能仍然希望承认存在一种普通话--一种在不同民族的成员确实相互交流的情况下使用的贸易平语。但这种语言几乎不可能用于讨论任何深度的问题。",
	"The River Heralds are a collection of small, nomadic bands of merfolk who were the dominant inhabitants of Ixalan before the rise of the Sun Empire. They live in harmony with the land, and their shamans wield powerful nature magic to control the elements of wind and water. They believe that the power of the Immortal Sun is too dangerous for anyone to wield—including themselves. And so they seek to protect the golden city of Orazca and steer all intruders away from it.": "河流牧羊人是一个小型的、游牧的人鱼部落的集合体，在太阳帝国崛起之前，他们是伊萨兰的主要居民。他们与土地和谐相处，他们的巫师挥舞着强大的自然魔法来控制风和水的元素。他们相信不朽的太阳的力量对任何人来说都是非常危险的，包括他们自己。因此，他们试图保护金色的奥拉兹卡城，并引导所有入侵者远离它。",
	"Consider the following class options for your River Herald character.": "考虑为你的《河流先驱》角色提供以下等级选择。",
	"Many River Herald shamans are druids of the Circle of the Land.": "许多先驱河的萨满是土地圈的德鲁伊。",
	"The warriors among the River Heralds include cunning strategists (often Battle Masters), bold Champions, and Eldritch Knights who fuse arcane magic with their use of weapons.": "河流预言家中的战士包括狡猾的战略家（通常是战斗大师）、大胆的冠军和将奥术魔法与武器的使用相融合的长老骑士。",
	"Other River Herald warriors wield the druidic magic of the forest in the defense of their lands. Wizard. The magic of wind, mist, illusion, and misdirection is the province of River Herald wizards.": "其他河流先驱者的战士在保卫他们的土地时挥舞着森林的德鲁伊魔法。巫师。风、雾、幻觉和误导的魔法是先驱河巫师的专长。",

	"I will one day find the Immortal Sun and use its power to drive the invaders from our land.": "有一天，我会找到不朽的太阳，用它的力量把侵略者赶出我们的土地。",
	"The society of the Legion of Dusk is built around the rites and devotion of a powerful church, led by undead paladins who sustain themselves on the blood of their enemies. After seven hundred years of war that saw them march across the entirety of their home continent, the vampires of the Legion have come to add Ixalan to their territory. Certain leaders among them also seek the Immortal Sun, which is dimly remembered in their own legends as a source of true immortality—eternal life, in contrast to the endless undeath they now endure.": "黄昏军团的社会是围绕着一个强大的教会的仪式和奉献而建立的，由不死的圣骑士领导，他们靠敌人的血来维持自己的生命。经过七百年的战争，他们的足迹遍布整个家乡大陆，军团的吸血鬼们来到了伊克萨兰的领土。他们中的某些领导人也在寻找不朽的太阳，在他们自己的传说中，不朽的太阳被模糊地记得是真正的不朽之源--永恒的生命，与他们现在忍受的无尽的不死形成对比。",

	"Azcanta, now called the Sunken Ruin, was a thriving population center until a prolonged conflict with the River Heralds caused it to sink into the waters of the Inner Sea. Its buildings are still largely intact far beneath the waves, and some pirates now seek the city's treasures.": "阿兹坎塔，现在被称为沉没的废墟，曾经是一个繁荣的人口中心，直到与河之先驱的长期冲突导致它沉入内海的水域。它的建筑在远处的海面下仍然基本完好无损，一些海盗现在正在寻找这座城市的宝藏。",
	"A few lone shrines and temples dot the jungle as well, the last remnants of cities whose wooden buildings have long since rotted away. These include Tonalixco, the temple of the eastern sun, which marked the western edge of the empire in the fortress-city of Tanaztac. Icalaquiampa, the temple of sunset, was the focus of a religious sect that tried to replace the emperor with a high priest and establish theocratic rule.": "丛林中还点缀着一些孤独的神殿和庙宇，它们是木制建筑早已腐烂的城市的最后遗迹。其中包括东方太阳神庙Tonalixco，它标志着帝国在塔纳兹塔克要塞城市的西部边缘。日落神庙Icalaquiampa是一个试图用大祭司取代皇帝并建立神权统治的宗教教派的焦点。",
	"Aclazotz was a temple dedicated to a bat god of the night, opposed to the Threefold Sun and the empire devoted to the sun. The temple makes an appearance in \"X Marks the Spot,\" a special D&D Ixalan adventure created for Extra Life 2017, but there's much more to this legendary site. Aclazotz was partially inspired by the classic D&D adventure The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan, which appears in updated form in Tales from the Yawning Portal. If you want to more fully explore the ruins, you might use that adventure as a starting point. Perhaps this is where Elenda, the knight who brought the rites of vampirism to the Legion of Dusk, underwent her own transformation.": "Aclazotz是一座供奉蝙蝠夜神的神庙，与三倍太阳和致力于太阳的帝国相对立。这座神庙在 \"X标记点 \"中出现，这是一个为2017年额外生活而创建的特殊D&D伊萨兰冒险，但这个传奇的地方还有很多。Aclazotz的部分灵感来自于经典的D&D冒险《塔莫阿昌的隐秘神殿》，它以更新的形式出现在《打哈欠的门的故事》中。如果你想更全面地探索这个遗迹，你可以把那个冒险作为一个起点。也许这里就是将吸血鬼仪式带给黄昏军团的骑士伊伦达，经历了她自己的转变。",
	"Of course, the grandest ruin of the ancient Sun Empire is Orazca, the glorious golden city where the Immortal Sun still lies hidden. It was the empire's capital for many centuries, and tribute from across the breadth of Ixalan was brought to adorn its palaces and temples. Gold covers nearly every building in the city, and jade inlays reflect the influence of the ancient merfolk who shared Orazca with the humans of the empire. But the world has since closed up over the golden city, hiding its secrets and its treasures from all who seek it. Three golden spires are now the only visible signs of Orazca where they rise above the forest floor.": "当然，古代太阳帝国最宏伟的遗迹是奥拉兹卡，那座辉煌的金色城市，不朽的太阳仍然隐藏在那里。它曾是帝国的首都，历经数个世纪，来自伊萨兰各地的贡品被拿来装饰它的宫殿和寺庙。黄金几乎覆盖了城市中的每一座建筑，玉石镶嵌反映了古代人鱼族的影响，他们与帝国的人类共享奥拉兹卡。但是，世界从此在这座黄金之城上空关闭，将它的秘密和宝藏从所有寻求它的人面前隐藏起来。现在，三个金色的尖顶是奥拉兹卡唯一可见的标志，它们耸立在森林地面上。",
	"Treasure is an important part of adventuring in any Dungeons & Dragons campaign, and that is perhaps more true on Ixalan than on most planes in Magic's Multiverse. You can use cards (including Treasure tokens) as inspiration for the kinds of treasures that adventurers might find. When a treasure hoard includes art objects, you can use these tables to provide a distinctive flavor to Ixalan's treasures. (If you look closely, you'll see many of these objects in the art on Treasure token cards, reproduced on these pages.)": "在任何龙与地下城活动中，宝藏都是冒险的重要组成部分，而在伊萨兰上，这一点也许比魔法多元宇宙中的大多数位面更真实。你可以使用卡牌（包括宝藏令牌）作为冒险者可能找到的各种宝藏的灵感。当宝藏包括艺术品时，你可以使用这些表格来为伊萨兰的宝藏提供独特的风味。(如果你仔细观察，你会在宝藏令牌上的艺术中看到许多这样的物品，在这些页面上都有转载）。",
	"All the planes of Magic's Multiverse are suffused with mana—the energy that fuels magic in all its forms. Mana is intricately linked with the physical world, and different types of terrain produce different \"colors\" of mana. Most mages specialize in the use of one or perhaps two colors of mana, and in the particular types of magical effects that mana can create.": "魔法多元宇宙的所有平面都充斥着法力--为各种形式的魔法提供动力的能量。法力与物理世界有着错综复杂的联系，不同类型的地形产生不同 \"颜色 \"的法力。大多数法师擅长使用一种或两种颜色的法力，以及法力所能产生的特殊类型的魔法效果。",
	"Color is a fundamental organizing principle of the Multiverse, closely linked with everything from physical geography to human personality. The following are just some of the correlations between color and other aspects of existence:": "颜色是多元宇宙的一个基本组织原则，与从自然地理到人类个性的一切都密切相关。以下只是颜色与存在的其他方面之间的一些关联。",
	"Different types of terrain generate mana of different colors. For example, mountains produce red mana,while plains produce white mana.": "不同类型的地形产生不同颜色的法力。例如，山脉产生红色法力，而平原产生白色法力。",
	"Each color is associated with a set of ideals, values, and principles. White is connected with protection and order, and green with life and nature.": "每种颜色都与一系列的理想、价值观和原则有关。白色与保护和秩序有关，绿色与生命和自然有关。",
	"Different colors of mana are used to power different kinds of spells. Spells of fire, lightning, and speed draw on red mana, while spells of water, ice, and the mind use blue mana.": "不同颜色的法力被用来驱动不同种类的法术。火、闪电和速度的法术使用红色法力，而水、冰和心灵的法术使用蓝色法力。",
	"Humans are exceptional, in that they don't have a particular aptitude or affinity for one color of mana. For other races, and even for nonsentient creatures, the connection is much stronger. Elves, for example, are typically green aligned. They use nature magic, and they value things like balance, stability, and interdependence. Hydras are also green aligned, though they don't use magic and they don't have values—even as they can be seen to embody those values. So if you wanted to summon a hydra, you'd use a green spell to do it.": "人类是个例外，因为他们对一种颜色的法力没有特别的天赋或亲和力。对于其他种族，甚至对于无知觉的生物，这种联系要强得多。例如，精灵是典型的绿色结盟者。他们使用自然魔法，重视平衡、稳定和相互依存等事物。水蛇也是绿色结盟的，尽管它们不使用魔法，也没有价值观--即使它们可以被视为体现了这些价值观。因此，如果你想召唤九头蛇，你会用绿色咒语来做。",
	"Sometimes magic or even powerful emotions can change the basic nature of people or creatures in a way that alters their color alignment. A vile curse might change someone from green aligned to black aligned (or both green and black aligned). A terrible loss that spurs someone to vengeance might add red to the person's color alignment—temporarily or even permanently.": "有时，魔法甚至是强大的情感可以改变人或生物的基本性质，从而改变他们的颜色排列。一个卑鄙的诅咒可能会把一个人从绿色排列变成黑色排列（或者同时是绿色和黑色排列）。一个可怕的损失刺激某人去复仇，可能会使这个人的颜色排列暂时甚至永久地变成红色。",
	"Different colors of mana are associated with different qualities of personality. It might be that a person who is emotionally driven, creative, and energetic is naturally drawn to the use of red mana; or perhaps using red mana brings out those qualities in a person. Most likely, the effect runs both ways.": "不同颜色的法力与不同的个性品质有关。可能是一个感情丰富、有创造力、精力充沛的人自然会被红色法力的使用所吸引；也可能是使用红色法力能激发一个人的这些品质。最有可能的是，这种影响是双向的。",
	"A character's or creature's \"color alignment\" is a sort of shorthand that sketches out its personality, alignment, and power suite—the kinds of effects that it creates with its magic or through its behavior. This section goes over the traits of each of the five colors, and offers suggestions for ways they might influence a D&D character.": "一个角色或生物的 \"颜色排列 \"是一种速记法，它勾勒出其个性、排列和力量组合--即它用魔法或通过其行为创造的各种效果。本节介绍了五种颜色的特征，并就它们可能影响D&D角色的方式提供了建议。",
	"Many mages, especially Planeswalkers, routinely draw on two or more colors of mana. In some worlds, color pairs or triads have such a strong identity that they are manifested in the world. The guilds of Ravnica, for example, are each aligned to a specific pair of mana colors, and each of the clans of Tarkir used three colors. And some lands produce mana of more than one color, so that a highland lake might produce both red and blue mana. Mana pairs similarly suggest certain principles, create certain magical effects, and favor certain personality traits.": "许多法师，尤其是行者，经常会利用两种或多种颜色的法力。在某些世界中，颜色对或三合一具有如此强烈的特性，以至于它们在世界中得到了体现。例如，拉夫尼卡的行会各自与一对特定的法力颜色相一致，而塔克尔的每个氏族都使用三种颜色。而有些土地会产生不止一种颜色的法力，所以一个高原湖泊可能会同时产生红色和蓝色的法力。法力对同样暗示了某些原则，创造了某些魔法效果，并有利于某些个性特征。",
	"Based on the color wheel, it's possible to speak of two colors of mana as either \"allied\" (adjacent to each other on the wheel) or \"enemy\" (separated by another color). White's allied colors are green and blue; its enemy colors are red and black. That doesn't mean that creatures associated with allied colors are necessarily on the same side of any conflict, or that creatures associated with enemy colors are actually enemies. But if conflict does arise—for example, in a party of adventurers—it's more likely to arise between a whitealigned and a red-aligned character than between a white-aligned and a blue-aligned one. That's the natural result of the different personalities and principles associated with each color. A white character might put a lot of stress on the value of law and order, and of working together toward a common goal. A red-aligned character values freedom and individuality.": "根据色轮，可以把两种颜色的法力说成是 \"盟友\"（在色轮上彼此相邻）或 \"敌人\"（被另一种颜色分开）。白色的盟友色是绿色和蓝色；其敌人色是红色和黑色。这并不意味着与盟友色相关的生物一定是在任何冲突中的同一方，或者与敌人色相关的生物实际上是敌人。但是，如果冲突真的发生了--例如，在一个冒险者队伍中--它更有可能发生在与白色结盟的角色和与红色结盟的角色之间，而不是与白色结盟的角色和与蓝色结盟的角色之间。这是与每种颜色相关的不同个性和原则的自然结果。一个白色的角色可能非常强调法律和秩序的价值，以及为一个共同的目标一起工作。一个红色结盟的角色重视自由和个性。",
	"In the language of the D&D game, the colors of mana are a means of categorizing the types of magic that suffuse all existence. When a spellcaster draws upon or manipulates the Weave (see chapter 10 in the Player's Handbook), part of that process involves tugging on a strand that connects to a land that produces mana of the desired color. Whether consciously or unconsciously, a druid casting barkskin tugs on a strand of the Weave connected to a forest in the world, drawing out the green mana needed to cast the spell.": "在D&D游戏的语言中，法力的颜色是对充斥于所有存在的魔法类型进行分类的一种手段。当施法者利用或操纵 \"编织\"（见《玩家手册》第10章）时，该过程的一部分涉及到拉扯一根连接到产生所需颜色法力的土地的线。不管是有意识还是无意识，施放巴克斯坦的德鲁伊都会拉动与世界上的森林相连的那根编织线，以汲取施法所需的绿色法力。",
	"There's no rules weight to this material; it's simply about roleplaying your character. If you're playing a cleric, you might find it helpful to imagine your character drawing on white mana, and you'll find that a lot of your spells could indeed be white spells in Magic. You might also find inspiration in the personality traits and ideals described in the white mana entry. But there's no rule preventing your character from using spells like divination (a blue spell), stone shape (a red spell), create undead (a black spell), or insect plague (a green spell). On the other hand, you might find that thinking about your cleric as a white-aligned caster shapes your choice of spells as well as your personality.": "这个材料没有规则的重量，它只是关于角色扮演你的角色。如果你扮演的是一个牧师，你可能会发现想象你的角色使用白法力是有帮助的，你会发现你的很多法术确实可以成为魔法中的白法术。你也可能从白法力条目中描述的人格特征和理想中找到灵感。但没有任何规则阻止你的角色使用占卜（蓝色法术）、石头形状（红色法术）、创造亡灵（黑色法术）或昆虫瘟疫（绿色法术）等法术。另一方面，你可能会发现，把你的牧师想成是一个白化的施法者会影响你对法术的选择以及你的个性。",
