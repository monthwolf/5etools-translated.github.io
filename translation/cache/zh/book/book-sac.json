	"The fifth edition of D&D has three official rulebooks, each of which was first published in 2014:": "第五版D&D有三本官方规则书，每本都是在2014年首次出版。",

	"The public statements of the D&D team, or anyone else at {@link Wizards of the Coast|https://dnd.wizards.com}, are not official rulings; they are advice. Jeremy Crawford's tweets are often a preview of rulings that will appear here.": "D&D团队或{@link Wizards of the Coast|https://dnd.wizards.com}的任何其他人的公开声明不是官方裁决；而是建议。杰里米-克劳福德（Jeremy Crawford）的推文通常是对将出现在这里的裁决的预览。",
	"A Dungeon Master adjudicates the game and determines whether to use an official ruling in play. The DM always has the final say on rules questions.": "地牢管理员对游戏进行裁决，并决定是否在游戏中使用官方的裁决。在规则问题上，管理员总是有最终决定权。",
	"Sage Advice answers that are relevant to the current state of the rules are compiled here.": "这里汇编了与规则的现状相关的Sage Advice答案。",
	"Rules are a big part of what makes D&D a game, rather than simply improvised storytelling.": "规则是使D&D成为游戏的重要部分，而不是简单的即兴故事。",
	"The game's rules are meant to help organize, and even inspire, the action of a D&D campaign. The rules are a tool, and we want our tools to be as effective as possible. No matter how good those tools might be, they need a group of players to bring them to life and a DM to guide their use.": "游戏规则的目的是帮助组织，甚至是激发D&D活动的行动。规则是一种工具，而我们希望我们的工具尽可能地有效。无论这些工具有多好，它们都需要一群玩家将其带入生活，并需要一个DM来指导其使用。",
	"The DM is key. Many unexpected things can happen in a D&D campaign, and no set of rules could reasonably account for every contingency. If the rules tried to do so, the game would become unplayable. An alternative would be for the rules to severely limit what characters can do, which would be counter to the open-endedness of D&D. The direction we chose for the current edition was to lay a foundation of rules that a DM could build on, and we embraced the DM's role as the bridge between the things the rules address and the things they don't.": "管理者是关键。在D&D活动中可能会发生许多意想不到的事情，没有一套规则能够合理地考虑到每一个意外情况。如果规则试图这样做，游戏就会变得不可玩。另一个选择是，规则要严格限制角色能做的事情，这与D&D的开放性是相悖的。我们为当前版本选择的方向是为规则打下基础，让管理员可以在此基础上发展，并且我们接受了管理员作为规则所涉及的事情和没有涉及的事情之间的桥梁作用。",
	"In a typical D&D session, a DM makes numerous rules decisions—some barely noticeable and others quite obvious. Players also interpret the rules, and the whole group keeps the game running. There are times, though, when the design intent of a rule isn't clear or when one rule seems to contradict another.": "在一个典型的D&D会议中，DM会做出许多规则决定--有些几乎看不出来，有些则相当明显。玩家也会对规则进行解释，而整个小组也会保持游戏的运行。不过，有时候，规则的设计意图并不明确，或者一条规则似乎与另一条规则相矛盾。",
	"When I answer rules questions, I often come at them from one to three different perspectives.": "当我回答规则问题时，我经常从一到三个不同的角度来看待它们。",
	"\"Rules as written\"—that's what RAW stands for. When I dwell on the RAW interpretation of a rule, I'm studying what the text says in context, without regard to the designers' intent. The text is forced to stand on its own.": "\"书面规则\"--这就是RAW的含义。当我纠结于规则的RAW解释时，我正在研究文本在上下文中的含义，而不考虑设计者的意图。文本被迫站在它自己的立场上。",
	"Whenever I consider a rule, I start with this perspective; it's important for me to see what you see, not what I wished we'd published or thought we'd published.": "每当我考虑一项规则时，我都从这个角度出发；对我来说，重要的是看到你所看到的东西，而不是我希望我们发表的或认为我们发表的东西。",
	"Some of you are especially interested in knowing the intent behind a rule. That's where RAI comes in: \"rules as intended.\" This approach is all about what the designers meant when they wrote something. In a perfect world, RAW and RAI align perfectly, but sometimes the words on the page don't succeed at communicating the designers' intent. Or perhaps the words succeed with one group of players but not with another.": "你们中的一些人对了解一项规则背后的意图特别感兴趣。这就是RAI的作用。\"规则的意图\"。这种方法是关于设计者写东西时的意思。在一个完美的世界里，RAW和RAI完全一致，但有时页面上的文字并不能成功传达设计者的意图。或者说，这些文字在一群玩家中成功了，但在另一群玩家中却没有。",
	"When I write about the RAI interpretation of a rule, I'll be pulling back the curtain and letting you know what the D&D team meant when we wrote a certain rule.": "当我写到RAI对一条规则的解释时，我将拉开帷幕，让你知道D&D团队在编写某条规则时是什么意思。",
	"Regardless of what's on the page or what the designers intended, D&D is meant to be fun, and the DM is the ringmaster at each game table. The best DMs shape the game on the fly to bring the most delight to their players. Such DMs aim for RAF, \"rules as fun.\" We expect DMs to depart from the rules when running a particular campaign or when seeking the greatest happiness for a certain group of players. Sometimes my rules answers will include advice on achieving the RAF interpretation of a rule for your group.": "无论页面上的内容或设计者的意图是什么，D&D都是为了好玩，而DM是每个游戏桌上的指挥者。最好的管理人在飞行中塑造游戏，给他们的玩家带来最大的快乐。这种DM的目标是RAF，即 \"作为乐趣的规则\"。我们希望DM在运行一个特定的活动时，或者在为某一群玩家寻求最大的快乐时，能够偏离规则。有时，我的规则答案会包括关于为你的团体实现规则的RAF解释的建议。",
	"I recommend a healthy mix of RAW, RAI, and RAF!": "我建议将RAW、RAI和RAF健康地混合在一起!",
	"{@book Chapter 1|PHB|1|Armor Class} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} describes how to determine AC, yet AC calculations generate questions frequently. That fact isn't too surprising, given the number of ways the game gives you to change your AC! Here are some ways to calculate your base AC:": "{@book Chapter 1|PHB|1|Armor Class}中描述了如何确定AC，然而AC的计算却经常产生问题。这一事实并不太令人惊讶，因为游戏给你提供了很多改变AC的方法！你可以通过以下方法来改变你的AC。这里有一些计算你的基本AC的方法。",
	"10 + your Dexterity modifier.": "10+你的灵巧修改器。",
	"10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier.": "10+你的灵巧修改器+你的宪法修改器。",
	"10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.": "10+你的灵巧修改器+你的智慧修改器。",
	"13 + your Dexterity modifier.": "13+你的灵巧修改器。",
	"10 + your Dexterity modifier + your natural armor bonus. This is a calculation method typically used only by monsters and NPCs, although it is also relevant to a druid or another character who assumes a form that has natural armor.": "10+你的灵巧修正值+你的自然护甲奖励。这是一种通常只由怪物和NPC使用的计算方法，尽管它也与德鲁伊或其他拥有自然护甲的角色有关。",
	"These methods—along with any others that give you a formula for calculating your AC—are mutually exclusive; you can benefit from only one at a time. If you have access to more than one, you pick which one to use. For example, if you're a sorcerer/monk, you can use either Unarmored Defense or Draconic Resilience, not both. Similarly, a druid/ barbarian who transforms into a beast form that has natural armor can use either the beast's natural armor or Unarmored Defense (you aren't considered to be wearing armor when you use natural armor).": "这些方法--以及任何其他给你计算AC的公式--是相互排斥的；你一次只能从一个方法中受益。如果你有机会使用多个方法，你可以选择使用哪一个。例如，如果你是一个巫师/僧侣，你可以使用 \"无甲防御 \"或 \"龙族恢复力\"，而不能同时使用。同样地，德鲁伊/野蛮人如果变身为有天然护甲的野兽形态，可以使用野兽的天然护甲或无护甲防御（当你使用天然护甲时，你不被认为是在穿护甲）。",
	"What about a shield? A shield increases your AC by 2 while you use it. For example, if you're unarmored and use a shield, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. Keep in mind that some AC calculations, such as a monk's Unarmored Defense, prohibit the use of a shield.": "盾牌呢？盾牌在你使用它的时候会增加你的AC值2。例如，如果你没有盔甲并使用盾牌，你的攻击力是12+你的灵巧修正值。请记住，有些AC计算方法，例如僧侣的无甲防御，禁止使用盾牌。",
	"Once you have your base AC, it can be temporarily modified by situational bonuses and penalties. For instance, having half cover gives you a +2 bonus to your AC, and three-quarters cover gives a +5 bonus. Spells sometimes modify AC as well. {@spell Shield of faith}, for example, grants a target a +2 bonus to AC until the spell ends.": "一旦你有了你的基本攻击力，它就可以被情况下的奖励和惩罚暂时修改。例如，有一半的遮蔽物会给你的AC值带来+2的奖励，而四分之三的遮蔽物会带来+5的奖励。法术有时也会修改AC。例如，{@spell Shield of faith}，给予目标一个+2的AC奖励，直到咒语结束。",
	"Magic items can also enhance your AC. Here are a few examples: {@item +1 chain mail} gives you an AC of 17, a {@item ring of protection} gives you a +1 bonus to AC no matter what you're wearing, and {@item bracers of defense} grant you a +2 bonus to AC if you're not wearing armor or using a shield.": "魔法物品也可以加强你的交流。这里有几个例子。{@item +1 chain mail}给你一个17的AC，一个{@item ring of protection}给你一个+1的AC奖励，无论你穿什么，{@item bracers of defense}给你一个+2的AC奖励，如果你不穿盔甲或使用盾牌。",
	"If an elf meditates during a long rest (as described in the Trance trait), the elf finishes the rest after only 4 hours. A meditating elf otherwise follows all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is changed.": "如果一个精灵在长时间的休息中进行冥想（如恍惚特性所描述的），那么这个精灵在4小时后就完成了休息。冥想中的精灵在其他方面遵循所有长期休息的规则；只有持续时间被改变。",
	"The lightfoot halfling and wood elf traits—Naturally Stealthy and Mask of the Wild—do allow members of those subraces to try to hide in their special circumstances even when observers are nearby. Normally, you can't hide from someone if you're in full view. A lightfoot halfling, though, can try to vanish behind a creature that is at least one size larger, and a wood elf can try to hide simply by being in heavy rain, mist, falling snow, foliage, or similar natural phenomena. It's as if nature itself cloaks a wood elf from prying eyes—even eyes staring right at the elf! Both subraces are capable of hiding in situations when most other creatures can't, but neither subrace's hiding attempt is assured of success; a Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check is required as normal, and an observant foe might later spot a hidden halfling or elf: \"I see you behind that guard, you tricksy halfling!\"": "光脚半身人和木精灵的特性--自然隐身和野性面具--允许这些子种族的成员在他们的特殊情况下尝试隐藏，即使观察者在附近。通常情况下，如果你在众目睽睽之下，你是无法躲避别人的。不过，一个轻足半身人可以尝试消失在一个至少大一号的生物后面，而一个木精灵可以通过在大雨、薄雾、落雪、树叶或类似的自然现象中尝试隐藏。就好像自然界本身为木精灵披上了隐身衣，使其免受窥视--甚至是盯着精灵的眼睛！这就是木精灵的魅力所在。这两个亚族都能在大多数其他生物无法躲藏的情况下躲藏起来，但是这两个亚族的躲藏尝试都不能保证成功；需要像平常一样进行灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查，观察力强的敌人后来可能会发现一个隐藏的半身人或精灵。\"我看到你在那个警卫后面了，你这个狡猾的半身人！\"",
	"A dragonborn sorcerer can choose a different ancestor for the racial trait and for the Dragon Ancestor feature. Your choice for the racial trait is your actual ancestor, while the choice for the class feature could be your ancestor figuratively—the type of dragon that bestowed magic upon you or your family or the kind of draconic artifact or location that filled you with magical energy.": "龙裔巫师可以为种族特征和龙族祖先特征选择一个不同的祖先。你对种族特征的选择是你真正的祖先，而对类别特征的选择则可以是你的祖先，即赋予你或你的家族以魔法的龙的类型，或使你充满魔法能量的龙族神器或地点。",
	"Unless a feature says otherwise, temporary hit points last until you finish a long rest (PH, 198).": "除非特征另有规定，临时命中率会持续到你完成一次长时休息（PH，198）。",
	"Extra Attack imposes no limitation on what you use for the attacks. You can use regular weapons, improvised weapons, unarmed strikes, or a combination of these options for the attacks.": "额外攻击对你使用的攻击方式没有限制。你可以使用普通武器、简易武器、徒手攻击或这些选项的组合进行攻击。",
	"You use Flash of Genius immediately after the triggering {@dice d20} is rolled and before any of the effects of the roll are applied. Unless a rule tells you otherwise, a reaction occurs immediately after its trigger.": "你在触发{@dice d20}的卷轴之后，在卷轴的任何效果被应用之前，立即使用 \"天才之光\"。除非有规则告诉你，一个反应在其触发后立即发生。",
	"Activating a Spell-Storing Item uses the Use an Object action.": "激活一个储存法术的物品需要使用 \"使用物品 \"动作。",
	"No. An infusion lasts until one of the circumstances described in the \"Infusing an Item\" section of the Infuse Item feature.": "输液持续到输液功能的 \"输液 \"部分所描述的情况之一。",
	"A barbarian's Danger Sense benefits the Dexterity saving throw against any effect that the barbarian can see.": "野蛮人的危险感应有利于对野蛮人所能看到的任何效果进行灵巧救赎。",
	"If you use the barbarian's Reckless Attack, all attack rolls have advantage against you until the start of your next turn.": "如果你使用野蛮人的鲁莽攻击，所有的攻击卷都对你有利，直到你下一回合开始。",
	"Yes, different effects stack if they don't have the same name. If a creature makes an ability check while it is under the effect of a {@spell guidance} spell and also has a Bardic Inspiration die, it can roll both a {@dice d4} and a {@dice d6} if it so chooses.": "是的，不同的效果如果不具有相同的名称，则可以叠加。如果一个生物在受到{@spell guidance}法术的影响时进行能力检定，并且也有一个吟游诗人的灵感模子，如果它选择的话，它可以同时掷出{@dice d4}和{@dice d6}。",
	"When you gain a level in the bard class, the class's Spellcasting feature lets you replace one bard spell you know with another bard spell of an appropriate level. A spell learned through your Magical Secrets feature counts as a bard spell for you, so it can be replaced upon gaining a bard level later. But it must be replaced by a bard spell, according to the rule in the Spellcasting feature.": "当你在吟游诗人等级中获得一个等级时，该等级的咒语功能可以让你用另一个相应等级的吟游诗人法术来替换你所知道的一个吟游诗人法术。通过你的魔法秘密功能学到的咒语对你来说算作一个吟游诗人的咒语，所以它可以在以后获得吟游诗人等级时被替换。但根据咒语功能的规则，它必须被一个吟游诗人的法术所取代。",
	"{@class Cleric||Destructive Wrath|Tempest} is meant to maximize lightning and thunder damage only.": "{@class Cleric||Destructive Wrath|Tempest}是为了最大限度地提高闪电和雷电伤害。",
	"No. Only a creature with 0 hit points benefits from the hit-point-restoration portion of the Circle of Mortality feature.": "不，只有命中率为0的生物才能从死亡之环的命中率恢复部分中获益。",
	"The druid explodes.": "德鲁伊爆炸了。",
	"Well, not actually. Druids have a taboo against wearing metal armor and wielding a metal shield. The taboo has been part of the class's story since the class first appeared in {@i Eldritch Wizardry} (1976) and the original {@i Player's Handbook} (1978). The idea is that druids prefer to be protected by animal skins, wood, and other natural materials that aren't the worked metal that is associated with civilization. Druids don't lack the ability to wear metal armor. They choose not to wear it. This choice is part of their identity as a mystical order. Think of it in these terms: a vegetarian can eat meat, but chooses not to.": "嗯，实际上不是。德鲁伊有一个禁忌，就是不能穿金属盔甲和挥舞金属盾牌。自从德鲁伊首次出现在{@i Eldritch Wizardry}(1976)和原始的{@i Player's Handbook}(1978)中，这个禁忌就一直是这个等级故事的一部分。这个想法是，德鲁伊更喜欢用兽皮、木材和其他自然材料来保护自己，而不是与文明相关的加工金属。德鲁伊并不缺乏穿金属盔甲的能力。他们选择不穿它。这种选择是他们作为一个神秘教团身份的一部分。可以这样想：一个素食者可以吃肉，但选择不吃。",
	"Transforming into a different size can be an effective way of escaping, depending on the nature of the bonds or confinement. All things considered, someone trying to keep a druid captive might be wise to stash the prisoner in a room with an opening only large enough for air to enter.": "根据束缚或禁锢的性质，变身为不同的体型可以是一种有效的逃跑方式。综上所述，试图囚禁德鲁伊的人可能会明智地将囚犯藏在一个开口只够空气进入的房间里。",
	"The creatures listed in Elemental Wild Shape—{@creature Air Elemental||air}, {@creature Earth Elemental||earth}, {@creature Fire Elemental||fire}, and {@creature Water Elemental||water} elementals—are specific creatures in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, not creature types or subtypes. Elemental Wild Shape allows you to transform into one of those creatures.": "元素狂野之形中列出的生物--{@creature Air Elemental||air}、{@creature Earth Elemental||earth}、{@creature Fire Elemental||fire}和{@creature Water Elemental||water}元素--是{@book Monster Manual|MM}中的特定生物，而不是生物类型或次类型。元素野性之形允许你转化为这些生物中的一种。",
	"Yes, since the elementals listed in Elemental Wild Shape can speak.": "是的，因为《元素野性之形》中列出的元素可以说话。",
	"A literal interpretation (RAW) of Wild Shape could reasonably lead you to think that transformed druids can speak only languages that appear in an elemental's stat block, but the intent (RAI) is that druids retain their knowledge, including of languages, when they transform and can speak the languages they know if an adopted form can speak.": "对 \"野性之形 \"的字面解释（RAW）可以合理地让你认为，变身后的德鲁伊只能说元素属性块中出现的语言，但本意（RAI）是德鲁伊在变身时保留他们的知识，包括语言，并且如果采用的形态可以说话，他们就可以说他们知道的语言。",
	"A druid can cast spells in a Wild Shape form only upon gaining the Beast Spells feature at 18th level.": "德鲁伊只有在18级获得野兽法术特性时才能以野性形态施展法术。",
	"A druid's Ritual Casting requires a ritual to be prepared. The spell from Magic Initiate is known but not prepared.": "德鲁伊的 \"仪式施法 \"需要准备一个仪式。魔法入门中的咒语是已知的，但没有准备好。",
	"Dueling and Defense, for example. You can benefit from more than one Fighting Style option at a time, as long as they don't have conflicting requirements, as Dueling and Great Weapon Fighting do.": "例如，决斗和防御。你可以同时从一个以上的战斗风格选项中受益，只要它们没有冲突的要求，就像决斗和大武器战斗那样。",
	"No, the Archery feature benefits ranged weapons. A melee weapon, such as a {@item dagger|PHB} or {@item handaxe|PHB}, is still a melee weapon when you make a {@book ranged attack|PHB|9|Ranged Attacks} with it.": "不，射箭功能有利于远程武器。一个近战武器，例如{@item dagger|PHB}或{@item handaxe|PHB}，当你用它做一个{@book ranged attack|PHB|9|Ranged Attacks}时，仍然是一个近战武器。",
	"The Great Weapon Fighting feature—which is shared by fighters and paladins—is meant to benefit only the damage roll of the weapon used with the feature. For example, if you use a {@item greatsword|PHB} with the feature, you can reroll any 1 or 2 you roll on the weapon's {@dice 2d6}. If you're a paladin and use Divine Smite with the greatsword, Great Weapon Fighting doesn't let you reroll a 1 or 2 that you roll for the damage of Divine Smite.": "伟大的武器战斗特性--由战士和圣骑士共享--是为了只让与该特性一起使用的武器的伤害卷受益。例如，如果你使用{@item greatsword|PHB}的功能，你可以在武器的{@dice 2d6}上重掷任何1或2。如果你是一个圣骑士并使用大剑的 \"神圣打击\"，\"伟大的武器战斗 \"不会让你为 \"神圣打击 \"的伤害重选1或2。",
	"Yes, you can use the {@class Fighter||Riposte|Battle Master} maneuver in response to an {@book opportunity attack|PHB|9|Opportunity Attacks} that misses you, assuming your {@book reaction|PHB|9|Reactions} is available.": "是的，你可以使用{@class Fighter||Riposte|Battle Master}机动性来应对错过你的{@book opportunity attack|PHB|9|Opportunity Attacks}，前提是你的{@book reaction|PHB|9|Reactions}可用。",
	"The bonus action comes after the cantrip, since using your action to cast a cantrip is what gives you the ability to make the weapon attack as a bonus action. That said, a DM would break nothing in the system by allowing an Eldritch Knight to reverse the order of the cantrip and the weapon attack.": "奖励动作在咒语之后，因为使用你的动作来施放咒语才使你有能力作为奖励动作进行武器攻击。也就是说，如果管理员允许长老骑士颠倒施放咒语和武器攻击的顺序，就不会破坏系统中的任何规定。",
	"No. Disarming {@action Attack} forces a creature to drop an object it is holding. Donned shields aren't merely held.": "不，解除武装{@action Attack}迫使一个生物放弃它所持有的物体。戴上的盾牌并不只是持有。",
	"Yes. A monk weapon must lack the two-handed property, but nothing prevents a monk from wielding such a weapon with two hands. Fundamentally, a monk weapon counts as such no matter how a monk uses it.": "是的。僧侣武器必须缺乏双手属性，但没有什么能阻止僧侣用双手挥舞这种武器。从根本上说，无论僧侣如何使用，僧侣武器都是如此。",
	"No. The feature grants a benefit that is similar to the finesse property, but the feature doesn't confer that property.": "不，该特征赋予了一个类似于精巧属性的好处，但该特征并不赋予该属性。",
	"A missile counts as a monk weapon if it is thrown using Deflect Missiles; it deals its damage or Martial Arts damage (the monk's choice).": "如果使用 \"偏转导弹 \"投掷导弹，则该导弹算作僧侣武器；它造成其伤害或武术伤害（由僧侣选择）。",
	"Yes. Stunning Strike works with melee weapon attacks, and an unarmed strike is a special type of melee weapon attack.": "是的，眩晕攻击适用于近战武器攻击，而徒手攻击是一种特殊类型的近战武器攻击。",
	"The game often makes exceptions to general rules, and this is an important exception: that unarmed strikes count as melee weapon attacks despite not being weapons.": "游戏经常对一般规则做出例外，这是一个重要的例外：尽管不是武器，但徒手打击也算作近战武器攻击。",
	"That feature grants immunity to both. As a result, a monk with Purity of Body can, for example, inhale a {@creature Young Green Dragon||green dragon's} poison breath unharmed. Similarly, the monk is unaffected by {@spell ray of sickness}, which both deals poison damage and imposes the {@condition poisoned} condition.": "该功能对两者都有免疫力。因此，一个拥有 \"身体纯净 \"的僧侣可以，例如，吸入{@creature Young Green Dragon||green dragon's}的毒气而不受伤害。同样地，僧侣不受{@spell ray of sickness}的影响，而{@spell ray of sickness}会造成毒药伤害并施加{@condition poisoned}条件。",
	"The Open Hand Technique intentionally ignores creature size. A monk's ki fuels many extraordinary effects! If a feature is limited by creature size, the feature tells you so.": "张开手的技巧有意忽略了生物的大小。僧侣的气力为许多非凡的效果提供动力。如果一项功能受到生物体型的限制，该功能会告诉你。",
	"No. The ki point cost in the feature applies only to the other spells in it.": "不，特征中的基点成本只适用于其中的其他法术。",
	"Yes. Even though you know Elemental Attunement automatically, without having to choose it, you can exchange it for a different discipline at 6th, 11th, or 17th level.": "是的。即使你自动知道元素调和术，而不需要选择它，你也可以在6、11或17级时将它换成一个不同的修行。",
	"A {@race tiefling} is a humanoid, not a fiend, and therefore escapes the notice of Divine Sense. The feature detects creatures that have the celestial, fiend, or undead creature type.": "A {@race tiefling}是一个人形生物，而不是一个魔族，因此能逃过神识的注意。该功能可以探测到具有天体、魔族或不死生物类型的生物。",
	"No. Divine Smite requires a melee attack using a weapon. The rules don't consider unarmed strikes to be weapons.": "不，\"神圣打击 \"需要使用武器进行近战攻击。规则不认为徒手攻击是武器。",
	"Divine Smite does work with a melee weapon attack, and an unarmed strike can be used to make such an attack. But the text of Divine Smite also refers to the \"weapon's damage,\" and an unarmed strike isn't a weapon.": "神圣打击确实对近战武器攻击有效，而且徒手打击可以用来进行这样的攻击。但 \"神圣打击 \"的文字也提到了 \"武器的伤害\"，而徒手打击并不是武器。",
	"If a DM decides to override this rule, no imbalance is created. Tying Divine Smite to weapons was a thematic choice on our part—paladins being traditionally associated with weapons. It was not a game balance choice.": "如果管理员决定推翻这一规则，就不会产生不平衡。将 \"神圣打击 \"与武器联系起来是我们的一个主题选择--传统上，圣骑士与武器有关。这不是一个游戏平衡的选择。",
	"Like other spellcasters, the ranger follows the rule on {@book components|PHB|10|Components} in chapter 10 of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}. A ranger typically uses a component pouch for the material components of spells, but doesn't start with one because rangers don't have spells at 1st level.": "和其他法术师一样，游侠也遵循《{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}》第十章中关于{@book components|PHB|10|Components}的规则。游侠通常使用组件袋来存放法术的材料成分，但由于游侠在1级时没有法术，所以没有开始使用组件袋。",
	"No. Whirlwind Attack is unusual, in that it's a single attack with multiple attack rolls. In most other instances, an attack has one attack roll. The rule on moving between attacks ({@i PHB}, \"{@book Moving Between Attacks|PHB|9|Moving between Attacks}\") lets you move between weapon attacks, not between the attack rolls of an exceptional feature like Whirlwind Attack.": "不，旋风攻击是不寻常的，因为它是一个有多个攻击卷的单一攻击。在大多数其他情况下，一次攻击有一个攻击卷。在攻击之间移动的规则（{@i PHB}, \"{@book Moving Between Attacks|PHB|9|Moving between Attacks}\"）让你在武器攻击之间移动，而不是在像旋风攻击这种特殊功能的攻击卷之间移动。",
	"The Sneak Attack description specifies that you can use the feature once per turn, but it's not limited to your turn. The feature also doesn't limit the number of times you can use it in a round.": "偷袭的描述说明你每回合可以使用该功能一次，但它并不限于你的回合。该特征也不限制你在一个回合内使用它的次数。",
	"The 5-foot limitation in Sneak Attack is unaffected by the reach of a weapon. That other enemy of the target is creating a close-up distraction, regardless of the weapon in hand.": "偷袭中的5英尺限制不受武器范围的影响。目标的那个其他敌人正在创造一个近距离的分心，不管手中的武器是什么。",
	"The rule states that if you are surprised, you can't move or take an action. A surprised rogue can use Evasion, since that feature doesn't require the rogue to take an action or move.": "规则规定，如果你被惊动，你就不能移动或采取行动。一个被惊吓的流氓可以使用闪避，因为该特性不需要流氓采取行动或移动。",
	"No. Each of these features has a precondition for its use; Reliable Talent activates when you make an ability check that uses your proficiency bonus, whereas the other two features activate when you make an ability check that doesn't use your proficiency bonus. In other words, a check that qualifies for Reliable Talent doesn't qualify for Remarkable Athlete or Jack of All Trades. And Remarkable Athlete and Jack of All Trades don't work with each other, since you can add your proficiency bonus, or any portion thereof, only once to a roll.": "这些特征中的每一个都有一个使用的前提条件；当你做一个使用你的熟练度加成的能力检查时，\"可靠的天赋 \"会被激活，而其他两个特征则在你做一个不使用熟练度加成的能力检查时被激活。换句话说，符合 \"可靠天赋 \"的检查并不符合 \"杰出运动员 \"或 \"万事通 \"的资格。杰出运动员和万事通也不能相互配合，因为你只能在一次检查中加入你的熟练度奖励，或其中的任何部分。",
	"A surprised creature stops being surprised at the end of its first turn in combat.": "一个被惊吓的生物在其战斗中的第一个回合结束时停止被惊吓。",
	"Yes. The intent is that a Thief can use spell scrolls with Use Magic Device.": "是的，本意是盗贼可以通过使用魔法装置来使用法术卷轴。",
	"Yes. Administering poison uses the {@action Use an Object} action.": "是的。施放毒药使用{@action Use an Object}行动。",
	"A sorcerer can use one Metamagic option once in the casting of a spell, not the same option more than once. For instance, a sorcerer can't quadruple the duration of a spell by spending 2 sorcery points on Extended Spell.": "巫师在施法过程中可以使用一个魔法选项一次，而不是同一选项多次。例如，一个巫师不能通过花费2个巫术点在扩展法术上来使法术的持续时间翻两番。",
	"That's correct. Elemental Affinity benefits one damage roll per casting of a spell, even if the spell allows more than one roll. So, for example, the feature improves one of the rays of a {@spell scorching ray} spell or one of the beams of an {@spell eldritch blast} spell.": "那是正确的。元素亲和力对每次施法的一个伤害卷有利，即使该法术允许多于一个卷。因此，举例来说，该功能可以提高{@spell scorching ray}法术的一个射线或{@spell eldritch blast}法术的一个光束。",
	"No, the sorcerer must follow the rule for casting a spell as a bonus action and casting another spell on the same turn; the other spell must be a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.": "不，巫师必须遵循作为额外行动施放一个法术并在同一回合施放另一个法术的规则；另一个法术必须是施放时间为1个行动的咒语。",
	"Yes, you can. It costs the number of sorcery points appropriate for the level of the spell you're duplicating.": "是的，你可以。它要花费与你所复制的咒语等级相适应的巫术点数。",
	"The spells granted by that feature aren't automatically known by a warlock. Those spells are added to the warlock spell list for the character, who can choose them when learning a new warlock spell of the appropriate level. Once learned, such a spell does count against the number of spells the warlock knows.": "该特征所赋予的法术并不自动被术士所知。这些法术被添加到角色的术士法术列表中，他可以在学习相应等级的新术士法术时选择这些法术。一旦学会，这种法术就会被计入术士所知道的法术数量。",
	"Eyes of the Rune Keeper lets you read any form of writing, including the linguistic meaning of a rune, if any.": "符文守护者之眼让你可以阅读任何形式的文字，包括符文的语言含义，如果有的话。",
	"The warlock's Pact of the Blade feature lets you create a melee weapon out of nothing. Whenever you do so, you determine the weapon's form, choosing from the melee weapon options in the {@book Weapons table|PHB|5|Weapons} in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}. For example, you can create a {@item greataxe|PHB}, and then use the feature again to create a {@item javelin|PHB}, which causes the greataxe to disappear.": "术士的 \"刀之契约 \"功能让你无中生有地创造出一件近战武器。每当你这样做的时候，你会决定武器的形态，从{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的{@book Weapons table|PHB|5|Weapons}近战武器选项中选择。例如，你可以创造一个{@item greataxe|PHB}，然后再次使用该功能来创造一个{@item javelin|PHB}，这将使大斧消失。",
	"The feature allows the conjuring forth of a melee weapon, yet we allow more versatility when it comes to magic weapons. We didn't want a narrow focus in this feature to make a warlock unhappy when a variety of magic weapons appear in a campaign. Does this versatility extend outside the melee theme of the feature? It sure does, but we're willing to occasionally bend a design concept if doing so is likely to increase a player's happiness.": "该功能允许召唤出近战武器，但当涉及到魔法武器时，我们允许更多的多样性。我们不希望在这个功能中出现一个狭窄的焦点，使术士在战役中出现各种魔法武器时不高兴。这种多功能性是否延伸到该功能的近战主题之外？当然是的，但是如果这样做有可能增加玩家的快乐，我们愿意偶尔弯曲一个设计概念。",
	"Yes. Someone other than the warlock can use a pact weapon before the weapon disappears.": "是的，术士以外的人可以在武器消失之前使用契约武器。",
	"The feature is intended to provide one-way communication. The warlock can use the feature to speak telepathically to a creature, but the feature doesn't give that creature the ability to telepathically reply. In contrast, the telepathy ability that some monsters have ({@i MM}, \"{@book Telepathy|MM|0|Telepathy}\") does make two-way communication possible.": "该功能旨在提供单向的交流。术士可以使用该功能与一个生物进行心灵感应，但该功能并不赋予该生物以心灵感应的能力。相比之下，一些怪物所具有的心灵感应能力（{@i MM}, \"{@book Telepathy|MM|0|Telepathy}\"）确实使双向交流成为可能。",
	"The ward regains hit points whenever the abjurer casts an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, not just when the ward has 0 hit points. As is normal for healing, the ward can't regain more hit points than its hit point maximum: twice the wizard's level + the wizard's Intelligence modifier.": "每当施法者施放一个1级或以上的施法咒语时，被监护人就会恢复命中率，而不仅仅是当被监护人的命中率为0时。就像正常的治疗一样，被害人恢复的命中率不能超过其最大命中率：巫师等级的两倍+巫师的智力修正值。",
	"Any abjuration spell of 1st level or higher cast by an abjurer, including a ritual, can restore hit points to the abjurer's Arcane Ward.": "任何由堕落者施放的1级或以上的堕落法术，包括仪式，都可以为堕落者的奥术护盾恢复命中率。",
	"An Arcane Ward is not an extension of the wizard who creates it. It is a magical effect with its own hit points. Any temporary hit points, immunities, or resistances that the wizard has don't apply to the ward.": "奥术护盾不是创造它的巫师的延伸。它是一个具有自身命中率的魔法效果。巫师所拥有的任何临时命中率、免疫力或抵抗力都不适用于这个防护罩。",
	"The ward takes damage first. Any leftover damage is taken by the wizard and goes through the following game elements in order: (1) any relevant damage immunity, (2) any relevant damage resistance, (3) any temporary hit points, and (4) real hit points.": "被害人首先受到伤害。任何剩余的伤害都由巫师承担，并依次通过以下游戏元素。(1)任何相关的伤害免疫，(2)任何相关的伤害抵抗，(3)任何临时命中率，以及(4)真实命中率。",

	"A transmuter must have {@spell polymorph} prepared, as normal, to cast it with the Shapechanger feature.": "转化者必须有{@spell polymorph}的准备，像平常一样，才能用变形者的特性来施展。",
	"No. In the case of a multipart object, the intent is that you must have seen all parts of the object to duplicate those parts. In the case of a book, if you have seen only the cover, then the duplicate created will be a copy of the cover, and the pages will be blank.": "在多部分对象的情况下，其目的是你必须看到对象的所有部分才能复制这些部分。在一本书的情况下，如果你只看到了封面，那么创建的副本将是封面的副本，而页面将是空白的。",
	"Yes. Portent requires you to be able to see the creature, but it has no range restriction.": "是的。暗示要求你能看到该生物，但它没有范围限制。",
	"No. As written, the rule doesn't require you to read from the book. The narrative intent, however, is that the wizard is reading from their book, but the only mechanical requirement is that the wizard has the spell in their spellbook.": "不，按照规定，该规则并不要求你从书中读出。然而，叙事的意图是巫师在读他们的书，但唯一的机械要求是巫师在他们的法术书中有这个法术。",
	"No. You can have only one background. It establishes key aspects of your life before you embarked on a life of adventure. If none of the backgrounds available matches your character concept, talk with your DM and use the {@book guidelines|PHB|4|Backgrounds} in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} to customize your own background.": "不，你只能有一个背景。它确定了你在开始冒险生活之前的生活的关键方面。如果没有一个可用的背景符合你的角色概念，请与你的管理员讨论，使用{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的{@book guidelines|PHB|4|Backgrounds}来定制你自己的背景。",
	"If you have proficiency with it, {@book heavy armor|PHB|5|Heavy Armor} doesn't affect Dexterity saving throws or ability checks, other than {@skill Stealth}.": "如果你精通它，除了{@skill Stealth}之外，{@book heavy armor|PHB|5|Heavy Armor}并不影响灵巧救赎或能力检查。",
	"Attacking with a shield doesn't deprive you of the shield's bonus to AC.": "用盾牌攻击并不会使你失去盾牌对AC的奖励。",
	"Ability score improvements are based on your level in a particular class, not your total character level if you multiclass. For instance, if you're a 4th-level multiclass character, you haven't yet received the Ability Score Improvement feature because you haven't attained 4th level in one of your classes.": "能力得分的提高是基于你在某一特定类别中的等级，而不是基于你的总角色等级（如果你是多类）。例如，如果你是一个四级多类的角色，你还没有得到能力得分的提高，因为你在其中一个类别中没有达到四级。",
	"Your base score, not a temporary score, has to meet a multiclassing prerequisite.": "你的基本分数，而不是临时分数，必须满足多类的先决条件。",
	"If any of your classes grants you cantrips, you get all of them.": "如果你的任何一个班级授予你咒语，你就能得到所有的咒语。",
	"A class offers various starting proficiencies that you get if it is your first class.

	"Regardless of whether a class is your first, you do gain any proficiencies that the class grants through its features. For instance, if you gain a level in cleric and choose the War Domain, you do benefit from the Bonus Proficiencies feature, even if cleric isn't your first class.": "无论一个等级是否是你的第一个等级，你都会获得该等级通过其特征赋予的任何能力。例如，如果你在牧师中获得一个等级并选择了战争领域，你就会从额外能力特征中获益，即使牧师不是你的第一个等级。",
	"A barbarian's Rage feature makes {@book concentration|PHB|10|Concentration} impossible but has no effect on spells, like {@spell spiritual weapon}, that don't require concentration.": "野蛮人的愤怒特征使{@book concentration|PHB|10|Concentration}成为不可能，但对不需要集中注意力的法术，如{@spell spiritual weapon}，则没有影响。",
	"Nothing in the barbarian's Rage feature precludes the use of maneuvers.": "野蛮人的狂暴特征中没有任何内容排除了机动的使用。",
	"The Sneak Attack feature works with a weapon that has the finesse or ranged property. An unarmed strike isn't a weapon, so it doesn't qualify. In contrast, a rogue/ monk can use Sneak Attack with a monk weapon, such as a {@item shortsword|PHB} or a {@item dagger|PHB}, that has one of the required properties.": "偷袭功能适用于具有精巧或范围属性的武器。徒手攻击不是武器，所以它不符合条件。相比之下，流氓/僧侣可以用僧侣武器，如{@item shortsword|PHB}或{@item dagger|PHB}来使用偷袭，该武器有一个必要的属性。",
	"The {@feat Charger} feat relies on you, not your mount, taking the {@action Dash} action.": "该{@feat Charger}特技依赖于你，而不是你的坐骑，采取{@action Dash}行动。",
	"When designing a feat with a narrow use, we consider adding at least one element that can benefit a character more broadly—a bit of mastery that your character brings from one situation to another. The second benefit of {@feat Crossbow Expert} is such an element, as is the first benefit of {@feat Great Weapon Master}. That element in Crossbow Expert shows that some of the character's expertise with one type of thing—crossbows, in this case—transfers to other things.": "在设计一个用途狭窄的特技时，我们至少要考虑增加一个能使角色更广泛受益的元素--你的角色从一种情况带到另一种情况的一点掌握。{@feat Crossbow Expert}的第二个好处就是这样一个元素，{@feat Great Weapon Master}的第一个好处也是如此。十字弓专家中的这个元素表明，这个人物对一种事物--这里是指十字弓--的一些专长可以转移到其他事物上。",
	"The short answer is no.": "简短的回答是没有。",
	"To dig deeper into this point, take a look at the following sentence in the definition of the ammunition property: \"Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack.\" The sentence tells us two important things. First, you're assumed to be drawing—that is, extracting with your hand—the ammunition from a container. Second, the act of drawing the ammunition is included in the attack and therefore doesn't require its own action and doesn't use up your free interaction with an object on your turn.": "为了更深入地挖掘这一点，请看一下弹药属性定义中的以下句子。\"从箭筒、箱子或其他容器中提取弹药是攻击的一部分。\" 这句话告诉我们两件重要的事情。首先，你被认为是在抽取--即用你的手将弹药从容器中取出。第二，拔出弹药的行为包括在攻击中，因此不需要自己的行动，也不会占用你在回合中与一个物体的自由互动。",
	"What does that all mean for a {@item hand crossbow|PHB}? It means {@feat Crossbow Expert} makes it possible to fire a hand crossbow more than once with a feature like Extra Attack, provided that you have enough ammunition and you have a hand free to load it for each shot.": "这一切对{@item hand crossbow|PHB}来说意味着什么？它意味着{@feat Crossbow Expert}使你有可能用额外攻击这样的功能多次发射手弩，前提是你有足够的弹药，并且你有一只手可以为每次射击装弹。",
	"It does! Take a look at the feat's third benefit. It says you can attack with a hand crossbow as a bonus action when you use the {@action Attack} action to attack with a one-handed weapon. A {@item hand crossbow|PHB} is a one-handed weapon, so it can, indeed, be used for both attacks, assuming you have a hand free to load the hand crossbow between the two attacks.": "它是这样的! 看一下该特技的第三个好处。它说当你使用{@action Attack}动作用单手武器攻击时，你可以用手弩作为额外动作。{@item hand crossbow|PHB}是一种单手武器，所以它确实可以用于两次攻击，前提是在两次攻击之间你有一只手可以给手弩装子弹。",
	"No. The {@feat Dual Wielder} feat lets you wield two one-handed weapons. Every heavy weapon in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} also has the two-handed property.": "不，{@feat Dual Wielder}的特技可以让你挥舞两把单手武器。{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的每一个重型武器也都有双手的属性。",
	"{@feat Elemental Adept} is the only feat in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} that you can take more than once.": "{@feat Elemental Adept}是{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中唯一可以多拿一次的壮举。",
	"You take the bonus action on your turn, anytime after you hit with the attack that grants the bonus action. So yes, you can move before taking the bonus action (if you have movement remaining).": "你在你的回合中采取额外的行动，在你用给予额外行动的攻击命中后的任何时候。所以是的，你可以在采取奖励行动之前移动（如果你有剩余的移动能力）。",
	"The {@feat Lucky} feat is a great example of an exception to a general rule. The general rule in this case is the one that tells us how advantage and disadvantage work. The specific rule is the Lucky feat, and we know that a specific rule trumps a general rule if they conflict with each other.": "{@feat Lucky}的壮举是一个很好的例子，说明一般规则的例外。本例中的一般规则是告诉我们优势和劣势是如何发挥作用的。具体的规则是 \"幸运 \"特技，我们知道，如果具体规则与一般规则相冲突，那么具体规则将战胜一般规则。",
	"If a DM wants advantage and disadvantage to play their normal roles even when the {@feat Lucky} feat is used, here's a way to do so: roll two d20s for advantage/disadvantage, roll a third {@dice d20} for Lucky, eliminate one of the three dice, and then use the higher (for advantage) or lower (for disadvantage) of the two dice that remain.": "如果DM想让优势和劣势在使用{@feat Lucky}特技时也能发挥正常的作用，这里有一个方法：掷两个D20表示优势/劣势，掷第三个{@dice d20}表示幸运，消除三个骰子中的一个，然后用剩下的两个骰子中较高的（表示优势）或较低的（表示劣势）。",
	"In short, you must follow your character's normal spellcasting rules, which determine whether you can expend spell slots on the 1st-level spell you learn from Magic Initiate.": "简而言之，你必须遵循你的角色的正常施法规则，这决定了你是否可以将法术槽消耗在你从魔法入门学习的一级法术上。",
	"A specific rule, such as the rule for {@book two-weapon fighting|PHB|9|Two-Weapon Fighting}, might break the general rule by telling you not to add your ability modifier to the damage. {@feat Polearm Master} doesn't have such a rule.": "一个特定的规则，例如{@book two-weapon fighting|PHB|9|Two-Weapon Fighting}的规则，可能会打破一般的规则，告诉你不要把你的能力修正值加到伤害上。{@feat Polearm Master}没有这样的规则。",
	"No. {@feat Savage Attacker} relies on a weapon's damage dice, and an unarmed strike isn't a weapon (a point that was clarified in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} errata).": "不，{@feat Savage Attacker}依赖于武器的伤害骰子，而徒手攻击并不是武器（这一点在{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}勘误表中得到了澄清）。",
	"No. The benefit of {@feat Savage Attacker} applies only to rolls of the weapon's damage dice, not to any extra damage that a feature or other ability might grant.": "不，{@feat Savage Attacker}的好处只适用于武器的伤害骰子的滚动，而不是任何特征或其他能力可能给予的额外伤害。",
	"The bonus attack takes place after the triggering attack. Here's why: the feat doesn't specify the bonus attack's timing, and when a {@book reaction|PHB|9|Reactions} has no timing specified, the reaction occurs after its trigger finishes ({@i DMG}, \"{@book Adjudicating Reaction Timing|DMG|8|Adjudicating Reaction Timing}\"). In contrast, an {@book opportunity attack|PHB|9|Opportunity Attacks} specifically takes place before its trigger finishes—that is, right before the target creature leaves your reach.": "奖励攻击发生在触发的攻击之后。这就是原因：该特技没有指定奖励攻击的时间，当{@book reaction|PHB|9|Reactions}没有指定时间时，反应会在其触发结束后发生（{@i DMG}, \"{@book Adjudicating Reaction Timing|DMG|8|Adjudicating Reaction Timing}\"）。相比之下，{@book opportunity attack|PHB|9|Opportunity Attacks}则是在其触发结束之前发生的，也就是说，在目标生物离开你的范围之前。",
	"Does the character with the {@feat Sentinel} feat still get the opportunity attack? The second benefit of the Sentinel feat is intended to counteract the {@action Disengage} action only. An enemy with the Fancy Footwork feature ({@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|SCAG}) or one that has the {@feat Mobile} feat can avoid provoking opportunity attacks from someone who has the Sentinel feat, as long as that enemy doesn't take the {@action Disengage} action.": "拥有{@feat Sentinel}特技的角色是否还能得到机会攻击？哨兵特技的第二个好处只是为了对抗{@action Disengage}的行动。一个拥有花式步法（{@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|SCAG}）或拥有{@feat Mobile}特技的敌人可以避免从拥有哨兵特技的人那里挑起机会攻击，只要该敌人不采取{@action Disengage}行动。",
	"No. The bonus action provided by the {@feat Shield Master} feat has a precondition: that you take the {@action Attack} action on your turn. Intending to take that action isn't sufficient; you must actually take it before you can take the bonus action. During your turn, you do get to decide when to take the bonus action after you've taken the Attack action.": "{@feat Shield Master} 特技所提供的额外行动有一个前提条件：你在你的回合中采取{@action Attack}的行动。仅仅打算采取该行动是不够的，你必须在采取奖励行动之前实际采取该行动。在你的回合中，你确实可以决定在你采取攻击行动后何时采取奖励行动。",
	"This sort of if-then setup appears in many of the game's rules. The \"if\" must be satisfied before the \"then\" comes into play.": "这种 \"如果-然后 \"的设置出现在许多游戏规则中。在 \"然后 \"发挥作用之前，\"如果 \"必须得到满足。",
	"The intent is no. The {@feat Tough} feat affects a druid's hit points, which are replaced by the beast's hit points while using Wild Shape.": "意图是否定的。{@feat Tough}的特技会影响德鲁伊的命中率，在使用野性塑形时，这些命中率会被野兽的命中率所取代。",
	"They aren't. It's easy to mistake the three rolls as three faces of the same thing, because they each involve rolling a {@dice d20}, adding any modifiers, and comparing the total to a {@book Difficulty Class|PHB|7|Ability Checks}, and they're all subject to advantage and disadvantage. In short, they share the same procedure for determining success or failure.": "它们并不是。我们很容易误认为这三种掷法是同一件事的三个方面，因为它们都涉及到掷一个{@dice d20}，加上任何修饰物，然后将总数与一个{@book Difficulty Class|PHB|7|Ability Checks}相比较，而且它们都受到优势和劣势的影响。简而言之，它们有相同的程序来决定成功或失败。",
	"Despite this common procedure, the three rolls are separate from each other. If something in the game, like the {@spell guidance} spell, affects one of them, the other two aren't affected unless the rules specifically say so. The next few questions touch on this point again.": "尽管有这种常见的程序，但这三个卷轴是相互独立的。如果游戏中的某些东西，比如{@spell guidance}的咒语，影响了其中一个，其他两个就不会受到影响，除非规则中特别说明。接下来的几个问题再次触及这一点。",
	"Ability checks don't score critical hits. Attack rolls do.": "能力检查并不能获得关键命中。攻击卷可以。",
	"Rolling a 1 on an ability check or a saving throw is not an automatic failure. A 1 is an automatic miss for an attack roll.": "在能力检查或蓄力投掷中掷出1并不意味着自动失败。1是攻击卷的自动失败。",
	"Curious about the spell's intent? The spell is meant to be a classic jinx—the sort seen in folklore—that is useful in and out of combat. In combat, the spell provides some extra necrotic damage. Outside combat, you could foil a cunning diplomat, for example, by casting the spell and imposing disadvantage on his or her Charisma checks.": "对该咒语的意图感到好奇？这个咒语是一个经典的扫把星--在民间传说中看到的那种--在战斗中和战斗外都很有用。在战斗中，该咒语提供一些额外的坏死伤害。在战斗之外，你可以挫败一个狡猾的外交官，比如说，通过施展这个咒语并对他或她的魅力检查施加不利因素。",
	"No. The feature benefits only ability checks. Don't forget that initiative rolls are Dexterity checks, so Jack of All Trades can benefit a bard's initiative, assuming the bard isn't already adding his or her proficiency bonus to it.": "不，该功能只对能力检查有利。不要忘了，主动性卷轴是灵巧检查，所以 \"万事通 \"可以使吟游诗人的主动性受益，前提是吟游诗人还没有把他或她的熟练度奖励加进去。",
	"No. That check is an ability check, so game effects tied to attack rolls don't apply to it. Going back to an earlier question, the {@spell hex} spell could be used to diminish a grappler's effectiveness. And if the grappler's target is under the effect of the {@action Dodge} action, that action doesn't inhibit the {@book grapple|PHB|9|Grappling}, since Dodge doesn't affect ability checks.": "不，那个检查是一个能力检查，所以与攻击卷相联系的游戏效果不适用于它。回到先前的问题，{@spell hex}咒语可以用来削弱抓捕者的效力。如果抓捕者的目标处于{@action Dodge}行动的影响下，该行动不会抑制{@book grapple|PHB|9|Grappling}，因为闪避不会影响能力检查。",
	"An extradimensional space (aka an extraplanar space) is outside other planes. Therefore, if you're on the Material Plane and your foe is in an extradimensional space, the two of you aren't on the same plane of existence.": "一个超维空间（又称平面外空间）是在其他平面之外。因此，如果你在物质位面，而你的敌人在一个超维空间，你们两个人就不在同一个存在位面。",

	"No. If you can't see something, it's not within your line of sight. Speaking of \"line of sight,\" the game uses the English meaning of the term, which has no special meaning in the rules.": "如果你看不到某个东西，它就不在你的视线范围内。说到 \"视线\"，游戏中使用的是这个术语的英文含义，在规则中没有特殊含义。",
	"Yes. Spellcasting is more strenuous than the activities listed on page 186 of the Player's Handbook: \"eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.\"": "是的，施法比《玩家手册》第186页所列的活动更费力气。\"吃、喝、阅读和处理伤口\"。",
	"No, here's how surprise works.": "不，这里是惊喜的作用。",
	"To be surprised, you must be caught off guard, usually because you failed to notice foes being stealthy or you were startled by an enemy with a special ability, such as the {@creature Gelatinous Cube||gelatinous cube's} Transparent trait, that makes it exceptionally surprising. You can be surprised even if your companions aren't, and you aren't surprised if even one of your foes fails to catch you unawares.": "要出其不意，你必须猝不及防，通常是因为你没有注意到敌人的隐身，或者你被一个具有特殊能力的敌人吓了一跳，比如{@creature Gelatinous Cube||gelatinous cube's}透明特性，使其异常惊讶。即使你的同伴不惊讶，你也能感到惊讶，即使你的一个敌人未能让你措手不及，你也不会感到惊讶。",
	"In short, activity in a combat is always ordered by initiative, whether or not someone is surprised, and after the first round of combat has passed, surprise is no longer a factor. You can still try to hide from your foes and gain the benefits conferred by being hidden, but you don't deprive your foes of their turns when you do so.": "简而言之，战斗中的活动总是由主动权决定的，无论某人是否感到惊讶，而在第一轮战斗结束后，惊讶不再是一个因素。你仍然可以试图躲避你的敌人，并获得被隐藏所赋予的好处，但你这样做时并不剥夺你的敌人的回合。",
	"No. When it's your turn, either you do something or you don't. If you don't want to do anything, consider taking the {@action Dodge} action so that you'll, at least, have some extra protection. If you want to wait to act in response to something, take the {@action Ready} action, which lets you take part of your turn later.": "不，当轮到你时，你要么做什么，要么不做。如果你不想做任何事，可以考虑采取{@action Dodge}行动，这样你至少会有一些额外的保护。如果你想等着对某件事情做出反应，就采取{@action Ready}行动，这可以让你在以后的回合中采取部分行动。",
	"For a variety of reasons, we didn't include the option to delay your turn:": "由于各种原因，我们没有包括延迟转身的选项。",
	"Your turn involves several decisions, including where to move and what action to take. If you could delay your turn, your decision-making would possibly become slower, since you would have to consider whether you wanted to take your turn at all. Multiply that extra analysis by the number of characters and monsters in a combat, and you have the potential for many slowdowns in play.": "你的回合涉及几个决定，包括在哪里移动和采取什么行动。如果你能推迟你的回合，你的决策可能会变得更慢，因为你将不得不考虑你是否要采取你的回合。将这种额外的分析乘以战斗中的角色和怪物的数量，你就有可能在游戏中出现许多迟缓的情况。",
	"The ability to delay your turn can make initiative meaningless, as characters and monsters bounce around in the initiative order. If combatants can change their place in the initiative order at will, why use initiative at all? On top of that, changing initiative can easily turn into an unwelcome chore, especially for the DM, who might have to change the initiative list over and over during a fight.": "延迟回合的能力会使主动权变得毫无意义，因为角色和怪物在主动权的顺序中跳来跳去。如果战斗人员可以随意改变他们在主动权顺序中的位置，那么为什么还要使用主动权？此外，改变主动权很容易变成一个不受欢迎的苦差事，特别是对管理员来说，他可能不得不在战斗中一次又一次地改变主动权列表。",
	"Being able to delay your turn can let you wreak havoc on the durations of spells and other effects, particularly any of them that last until your next turn. Simply by changing when your turn happens, you could change the length of certain spells. The way to guard against such abuse would be to create a set of additional rules that would limit your ability to change durations. The net effect? More complexity would be added to the game, and with more complexity, there is greater potential for slower play.": "能够推迟你的回合可以让你对法术和其他效果的持续时间进行破坏，特别是任何持续到你下一回合的效果。仅仅通过改变你的回合发生时间，你就可以改变某些法术的长度。防止这种滥用的方法是建立一套额外的规则，以限制你改变持续时间的能力。净效果是什么？更多的复杂性将被添加到游戏中，而随着更多的复杂性，有更大的可能性会出现更慢的游戏。",
	"Two of our goals for combat were for it to be speedy and for initiative to matter. We didn't want to start every combat by rolling initiative and then undermine turn order with a delay option. Moreover, we felt that toying with initiative wasn't where the focus should be in battle. Instead, the dramatic actions of the combatants should be the focus, with turns that happen as quickly as possible.": "我们对战斗的两个目标是使其快速和主动性重要。我们不希望每次战斗都以滚动主动权开始，然后用延迟选项破坏回合秩序。此外，我们觉得玩弄主动权并不是战斗中的重点所在。相反，战斗人员的戏剧性行动应该是重点，回合应该尽可能快地发生。",

	"If you can take the {@action Dash} action as a bonus action, nothing in the rules prevents you from taking the {@action Dash} action with your regular action too. The same principle holds when you use a feature like Action Surge; you could use both of your actions to take the {@action Dash} action.": "如果你可以把{@action Dash}的行动作为一个额外的行动，那么规则中没有任何东西可以阻止你用你的常规行动来进行{@action Dash}的行动。当你使用像行动突进这样的功能时，同样的原则也适用；你可以用你的两个行动来进行（％2）的行动。",

	"Dealing damage to a moving target doesn't halt its movement, unless the damage is accompanied by an ability that stops movement. Things like the {@feat Sentinel} feat give you such an ability. Reducing a moving creature to 0 hit points is also usually an effective way to stop it!": "对一个移动的目标造成伤害并不会停止其运动，除非伤害伴随着停止运动的能力。像{@feat Sentinel}特技就能给你这种能力。将一个移动中的生物降低到0命中率通常也是阻止它的一个有效方法。",
	"No, since you can't take a bonus action on someone else's turn.": "不，因为你不能在别人的回合中采取奖励行动。",

	"For example, if you make a melee weapon attack with a longsword, you add your Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls of the attack. In contrast, if you make the spell attack of the {@spell fire bolt} cantrip, you add your spellcasting ability modifier to the attack roll. If you're a wizard, Intelligence is your spellcasting ability, so add your Intelligence modifier. {@spell Fire bolt} doesn't tell you to add your modifier to its damage roll, though, so you don't.": "例如，如果你用长剑进行近战武器攻击，你在攻击和伤害卷上加上你的力量修饰。相比之下，如果你进行{@spell fire bolt}cantrip的法术攻击，你在攻击卷上加上你的法术能力修饰。如果你是一个巫师，智力是你的法术能力，所以要加上你的智力修饰值。(1%)并没有告诉你要在它的伤害卷上加上你的修正值，所以你不会这样做。",
	"Various features in the game make explicit exceptions to the rule. For example, a weapon that has the finesse property lets you choose whether to use your Strength or Dexterity modifier with it. Another example: when you use the two-weapon fighting option in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} ({@i PHB} \"{@book Two-Weapon Fighting|PHB|9|Two-Weapon Fighting}\"), you don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.

	"It means a melee attack with a weapon. Similarly, \"ranged weapon attack\" means a ranged attack with a weapon.

	"The {@book grappling|PHB|9|Grappling} rule was written for a grappler with at least one hand, but a DM can easily adapt the rule for a handless creature that has a bite or an appendage, such as a tentacle, that could reasonably seize someone.

	"Keep in mind that the grappling rule in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} requires the {@action Attack} action, so a creature must take that action—rather than Multiattack or another action in the creature's stat block—when it uses that rule. A monster, such as a {@creature roper}, that has a special grappling attack doesn't follow that rule when using its special attack.": "请记住，{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的抓捕规则需要{@action Attack}的行动，所以当一个生物使用该规则时，必须采取该行动--而不是多重攻击或该生物状态块中的其他行动。一个怪物，例如（％2％），有一个特殊的抓取攻击，在使用它的特殊攻击时并不遵循该规则。",

	"You're aware that a spell is affecting you if it has a perceptible effect or if its text says you're aware of it (see {@i PHB}, under \"{@book Targets|PHB|10|Targets}\"). Most spells are obvious. For example, {@spell fireball} burns you, {@spell cure wounds} heals you, and {@spell command} forces you to suddenly do something you didn't intend.

	"In summary, to make a spell attack, you have to first cast a spell or use a feature that creates the spell's effect. A game feature, such as Extra Attack, that lets you make an attack doesn't let you cast a spell unless it says it does.": "总之，要进行法术攻击，你必须先施展法术或使用产生法术效果的功能。一个让你进行攻击的游戏功能，如额外攻击，不会让你施放法术，除非它说它会。",
	"Each spell has a casting time. A game feature, such as an opportunity attack, doesn't let you bypass that casting time, unless the feature says otherwise.

	"Such a spell is cast at its lowest possible level, which is the level that appears near the top of its description. Unless you have a special ability that says otherwise, the only way to increase the level of a spell is to expend a higher-level spell slot when you cast it.": "这样的咒语是以其可能的最低等级施放的，也就是其描述中靠近顶部的等级。除非你有一个特殊的能力，否则提高法术等级的唯一方法是在施放法术时消耗一个更高级别的法术槽。",
	"Here are some examples:": "这里有一些例子。",

	"There's no rule that says you can cast only X number of spells on your turn, but there are some practical limits. The main limiting factor is your action.

	"You sure can! Here's a common way for it to happen: Cornelius the wizard is casting {@spell fireball} on his turn, and his foe casts {@spell counterspell} on him.

	"A spell doesn't consume its material components unless its description says it does. For example, the pearl required by the {@spell identify} spell isn't consumed, whereas the diamond required by {@spell raise dead} is used up when you cast the spell.": "一个法术不会消耗它的物质成分，除非它的描述说它会消耗。例如，{@spell identify}法术所需的珍珠不会被消耗，而{@spell raise dead}法术所需的钻石会在你施法时被消耗掉。",
	"No. A spellcasting focus can be used in place of a material component only if that component has no cost noted in the spell's description and if that component isn't consumed.": "只有当某一部件在法术描述中没有注明成本，并且该部件没有被消耗时，才可以使用法术焦点来代替物质部件。",
	"The DC is 15 in that case. When temporary hit points absorb damage for you, you're still taking damage, just not to your real hit points.": "在这种情况下，DC是15。当临时命中率为你吸收伤害时，你仍然在承受伤害，只是不影响你的真实命中率。",
	"In contrast, a feature like the wizard's Arcane Ward can take damage for you, potentially eliminating the need to make a Constitution saving throw or, at least, lowering the DC of that save.": "相比之下，像巫师的奥术护盾这样的功能可以为你承受伤害，有可能不需要进行宪法规定的救赎，或者至少降低救赎的DC。",
	"When {@spell animate dead} targets a corpse, the body must have belonged to a creature of the humanoid creature type. If the spell targets a pile of bones, there is no creature type restriction; the bones become a skeleton.": "当{@spell animate dead}的目标是一具尸体时，该尸体必须属于人形生物类型的生物。如果法术的目标是一堆骨头，则没有生物类型的限制；骨头会变成一个骨架。",
	"No. Commanding the newly created creatures with your bonus action does end time stop, however.": "然而，用你的额外行动指挥新创造的生物会结束时间停止。",

	"{@spell Barkskin} specifies that your AC can't be lower than 16 while you are affected by the spell. This means you effectively ignore any modifiers to your AC—including your Dexterity modifier, your armor, a shield, and cover—unless your AC is higher than 16. For example, if your AC is normally 14, it's 16 while {@spell barkskin} is on you. If your AC is normally 15 and you have half cover, your AC is 17; {@spell barkskin} isn't relevant in this case.": "{@spell Barkskin}规定，当你受到法术影响时，你的AC不能低于16。这意味着你有效地忽略了对你AC的任何修饰--包括你的灵巧修饰、你的盔甲、盾牌和掩护--除非你的AC高于16。例如，如果你的AC值通常是14，当(1%)在你身上时，它就是16。如果你的AC通常是15，而你有一半的掩护，你的AC是17；{@spell barkskin}在这种情况下并不相关。",
	"\"The next time\" in the spell description indicates that the extra damage applies only once, the first time you hit a creature after you finish casting the spell.": "法术描述中的 \"下一次 \"表示额外伤害只适用一次，就是你完成施法后第一次击中生物的时候。",

This is true even if the target takes none of the necrotic damage, whether because of immunity or some other reason.": "{@spell Chill touch}确实能阻止它所击中的目标恢复命中率，直到法术结束。即使目标没有受到坏死伤害，无论是因为免疫还是其他原因，这也是真的。",
	"{@spell Cloud of daggers} (5 ft. cube) can affect more than one square on a grid, unless the DM says effects snap to the grid. There are many ways to position that cube.": "{@spell Cloud of daggers}(5英尺的立方体)可以影响网格上的一个以上的方块，除非DM说效果是固定在网格上的。有许多方法可以定位这个立方体。",

	"Some spells of this sort specify that the spellcaster chooses the creature conjured. For example, {@spell find familiar} gives the caster a list of animals to choose from.": "有些这类法术规定施法者要选择所变出的生物。例如，{@spell find familiar}给施法者提供了一个可供选择的动物名单。",
	"Other spells of this sort let the spellcaster choose from among several broad options. For example, {@spell conjure minor elementals} offers four options. Here are the first two:": "其他这类法术让施法者从几个广泛的选项中选择。例如，{@spell conjure minor elementals}提供四个选项。这里是前两个。",
	"One elemental of challenge rating 2 or lower": "一个挑战等级为2级或以下的元素",
	"Two elementals of challenge rating 1 or lower": "两个挑战等级为1或更低的元素",
	"The design intent for options like these is that the spellcaster chooses one of them, and then the DM decides what creatures appear that fit the chosen option. For example, if you pick the second option, the DM chooses the two elementals that have a challenge rating of 1 or lower.": "像这样的选项的设计意图是，施法者选择其中之一，然后由DM决定出现哪些符合所选选项的生物。例如，如果你选择第二个选项，DM就会选择两个挑战等级为1或更低的元素。",
	"A spellcaster can certainly express a preference for what creatures shows up, but it's up to the DM to determine if they do. The DM will often choose creatures that are appropriate for the campaign and that will be fun to introduce in a scene.": "施法者当然可以表达对出现的生物的偏好，但要由DM来决定他们是否这样做。DM通常会选择适合活动的生物，而且在场景中介绍这些生物会很有趣。",
	"Counterspell targets the other spellcaster.": "反咒的目标是另一个施法者。",
	"Spending the Hit Dice affects the homunculus as described in the spell, but the wizard's hit point maximum isn't decreased.": "花费命中率会影响到同形体，正如法术中所描述的那样，但巫师的最大命中率并没有减少。",
	"No. The {@spell darkness} spell can dispel only a light-creating spell of 2nd level or lower, no matter what spell slot is used for {@spell darkness}. Similarly, the {@spell daylight} spell can dispel only a darkness-creating spell of 3rd level or lower, regardless of the spell slot used.": "不，{@spell darkness}的咒语只能驱散二级或更低级的创造光明的咒语，无论{@spell darkness}使用的是什么咒语槽。同样地，{@spell daylight}的咒语只能驱散一个3级或更低级的创造黑暗的咒语，无论使用的是什么咒语槽。",
	"Yes. The {@spell disintegrate} spell turns you into dust only if the spell's damage leaves you with 0 hit points. If you're a half-orc, Relentless Endurance can turn the 0 into a 1 before the spell can disintegrate you.": "是的，{@spell disintegrate}咒语只有在咒语的伤害使你的生命值为0时才会将你变成尘埃。如果你是半兽人，无情的耐力可以在法术将你瓦解之前将0变成1。",
	"{@spell Dispel magic} has a particular purpose: to break other spells. It has no effect on a vampire's Charm ability or any other magical effect that isn't a spell. It also does nothing to the properties of a magic item. It can, however, end a spell cast from a magic item or from another source. Spells—they're what {@spell dispel magic} is about. For example, if you cast {@spell dispel magic} on a {@item staff of power}, the spell fails to disrupt the staff's magical properties, but if the staff's wielder casts {@spell hold monster} from the staff, {@spell dispel magic} can end that spell if cast on the target of {@spell hold monster}.": "{@spell Dispel magic}有一个特殊的目的：破解其他法术。它对吸血鬼的魅惑能力或任何其他不是咒语的魔法效果没有影响。它对魔法物品的属性也没有任何作用。然而，它可以结束一个从魔法物品或其他来源施放的咒语。法术--它们是{@spell dispel magic}的内容。例如，如果你在一个{@spell dispel magic}的法杖上施放{@item staff of power}，这个法术不能破坏法杖的魔法属性，但是如果法杖的持有者从法杖上施放{@spell hold monster}，如果对{@spell hold monster}的目标施放，{@spell dispel magic}可以结束这个法术。",

	"Another example: {@spell cure wounds} instantaneously restores hit points to a creature. Because the spell's duration is instantaneous, the restoration can't be later dispelled. And you don't suddenly lose hit points if you step into an {@spell antimagic field} !": "另一个例子。{@spell cure wounds} 瞬间恢复一个生物的命中率。因为该法术的持续时间是瞬时的，所以该恢复不能在之后被驱散。而且，如果你踏入一个{@spell antimagic field}！你也不会突然失去命中率。",
	"In contrast, a spell like {@spell conjure woodland beings} has a non-instantaneous duration, which means its creations can be ended by {@spell dispel magic} and they temporarily disappear within an {@spell antimagic field}.": "相比之下，像{@spell conjure woodland beings}这样的法术有一个非瞬时的持续时间，这意味着它的创造可以被{@spell dispel magic}结束，它们在{@spell antimagic field}内暂时消失。",
	"Yes, {@spell dispel magic} can dispel the barrier created by {@spell globe of invulnerability}, but not any magical effects that are active inside the barrier.": "是的，{@spell dispel magic}可以驱除{@spell globe of invulnerability}所创造的屏障，但不能驱除任何在屏障内活动的魔法效果。",

	"A {@spell Find Familiar||familiar} is an allied creature. Its proximity to a target can allow you to use the Sneak Attack feature or any other feature that requires the presence of an ally.": "一个{@spell Find Familiar||familiar}是一个盟友生物。它接近目标可以让你使用偷袭功能或任何其他需要盟友在场的功能。",
	"No, the intent of find familiar is that any objects are left behind when the familiar vanishes. This intent will be reflected in future printings of the Player's Handbook.": "不，寻找熟悉物的意图是，当熟悉物消失时，任何物体都会被留下。这一意图将反映在未来出版的《玩家手册》中。",
	"The fire of the {@spell fireball} spell can spread around corners, but it's limited by the spell's 20-foot radius. It doesn't extend farther than 20 feet from the point of origin no matter where it is cast.": "{@spell fireball}法术的火焰可以在角落里蔓延，但它受到法术的20英尺半径的限制。无论在哪里施法，它都不会从起源点延伸到20英尺以外的地方。",
	"Introduced in the {@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|SCAG}, the {@spell green-flame blade|TCE} and {@spell booming blade|TCE} spells pose a number of questions, because they each do something unusual: require you to make a melee attack with a weapon as part of the spell's casting.": "在{@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|SCAG}中引入的{@spell green-flame blade|TCE}和{@spell booming blade|TCE}法术提出了一些问题，因为它们都做了一些不寻常的事情：要求你用武器进行近战攻击，作为施法的一部分。",
	"First, each of these spells involves a normal melee weapon attack, not a spell attack, so you use whatever ability modifier you normally use with the weapon. (A spell tells you if it includes a spell attack, and neither of these spells do.) For example, if you use a {@item longsword|PHB} with {@spell green-flame blade|TCE}, you use your Strength modifier for the weapon's attack and damage rolls.": "首先，这些法术中的每一个都涉及到普通的近战武器攻击，而不是法术攻击，所以你使用你通常对武器使用的任何能力修改器。(一个法术会告诉你它是否包括法术攻击，而这些法术都没有）。例如，如果你用{@item longsword|PHB}和{@spell green-flame blade|TCE}，你用你的力量修正器来进行武器的攻击和伤害卷。",
	"Second, neither {@spell green-flame blade|TCE} nor {@spell booming blade|TCE} works with Extra Attack or any other feature that requires the {@action Attack} action. Like other spells, these cantrips require the {@action Cast a Spell} action, not the Attack action, and they can't be used to make an opportunity attack, unless a special feature allows you to do so.": "其次，{@spell green-flame blade|TCE}和{@spell booming blade|TCE}都不能与额外攻击或任何其他需要{@action Attack}动作的功能一起使用。和其他法术一样，这些咒语需要{@action Cast a Spell}动作，而不是攻击动作，而且它们不能被用来进行机会攻击，除非有特殊功能允许你这样做。",
	"Is it 20 because that's how much it dealt or 10 because that's how much the target took? It dealt 10 damage to the creature, so 10 is subtracted from the total.": "是20，因为它造成了多少伤害，还是10，因为目标承受了多少伤害？它对生物造成的伤害是10，所以从总数中减去了10。",
	"{@spell Hail of thorns} lasts until you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack or your {@book concentration|PHB|10|Concentration} ends, whichever comes first.": "{@spell Hail of thorns}持续到你用远程武器攻击击中一个生物或你的{@book concentration|PHB|10|Concentration}结束，以先到者为准。",
	"No. Activating a magic item isn't a function of the {@action Use an Object} action ({@i DMG}, \"{@book Activating an Item|DMG|7|Activating an Item}\").": "不，激活一个魔法物品并不是{@action Use an Object}动作的功能（{@i DMG}, \"{@book Activating an Item|DMG|7|Activating an Item}\"）。",
	"The {@spell heroes' feast} spell grants immunity to poison in any form—damage and the {@condition poisoned|phb|condition}.": "{@spell heroes' feast}的法术给予对任何形式的毒药-伤害和{@condition poisoned|phb|condition}的豁免权。",
	"Temporary hit points aren't cumulative. The spell would tell you if you were meant to add together the temporary hit points it provides. At the start of each of your turns, the spell, effectively, refreshes the number of temporary hit points you have from it; if you lost some or all of the temporary hit points, the spell gives them back to you.": "临时命中率是不能累积的。咒语会告诉你，如果你是要把它提供的临时命中率加在一起的话。在你每个回合开始时，该咒语，有效地，从它那里刷新了你的临时命中点数；如果你失去了部分或全部临时命中点数，该咒语会把它们还给你。",
	"The {@spell heroism} spell would suppress a frightening effect that was already on its target. When the spell ends, the target's immunity goes away and the frightening effect resumes if it has not expired or been removed.": "{@spell heroism}的法术会抑制已经在目标身上的惊吓效果。当咒语结束时，目标的免疫力会消失，如果惊吓效果没有过期或被移除，则会重新开始。",
	"The extra damage in the {@spell hex} spell requires an attack that hits.": "{@spell hex}的法术中的额外伤害需要有一次击中的攻击。",
	"Your jump is limited by how far you can move; each foot jumped uses a foot of movement. You can take the {@action Dash} action if you want to extend how far you can move on your turn.": "你的跳跃受到你能移动的距离的限制；每跳一英尺就会使用一英尺的移动。如果你想在你的回合中延长你能移动的距离，你可以采取{@action Dash}行动。",
	"For example, if you have a Strength score of 15, you can normally leap 15 feet when you make a long jump if you move at least 10 feet immediately beforehand. If the {@spell jump} spell is cast on you, that potential jump distance is tripled. That's a jump of 45 feet! If your speed is 30 feet, you can use only 30 feet of that jump distance on your turn, unless you take the {@action Dash} action, which allows you to leap the full 45 feet.": "例如，如果你的力量得分是15分，当你进行远跳时，如果你在紧接之前移动了至少10英尺，你通常可以跃过15英尺。如果{@spell jump}的法术被施加在你身上，这个潜在的跳跃距离会增加三倍。这就是45英尺的跳跃! 如果你的速度是30英尺，你在你的回合中只能使用30英尺的跳跃距离，除非你采取{@action Dash}的行动，这样你可以跳满45英尺。",
	"{@spell Mage armor} works with a {@item shield|PHB}. Shields are grouped with armor in the equipment rules in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, but various game features distinguish between the armor you wear and a shield you wield. Take a look at the monk's Unarmored Defense feature and compare it to the barbarian's version. In the monk's version, you must both forgo wearing armor and forgo wielding a shield if you want to benefit from the feature, whereas a barbarian must only forgo wearing armor.": "{@spell Mage armor}与{@item shield|PHB}一起工作。盾牌在装备规则中与盔甲归为{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}，但各种游戏特性区分了你穿的盔甲和你挥舞的盾牌。看看僧侣的无甲防御功能，并将其与野蛮人的版本进行比较。在僧侣的版本中，如果你想从该功能中获益，你必须同时放弃穿戴盔甲和放弃挥舞盾牌，而野蛮人则必须只放弃穿戴盔甲。",
	"Some spells and class features have figurative, not literal, names. The text of the spell or class feature explains what it does. In this case, {@spell mage armor} surrounds the target with \"protective magical force\"; the spell doesn't provide armor.": "有些法术和类特性的名称是比喻性的，而不是字面的。咒语或类特性的文字解释了它的作用。在这个例子中，{@spell mage armor}用 \"保护性的魔法力量 \"包围目标；该法术不提供护甲。",
	"An illusory object made by {@spell minor illusion} is meant to be like a stool or a rock, not an atmospheric effect.": "由{@spell minor illusion}制造的虚幻物体是为了像凳子或石头一样，而不是一种大气效果。",
	"No, the caster's worn and carried equipment are intended to go with them.": "不，施法者的穿戴和携带的装备都是为了配合他们。",
	"Some teleportation effects do specify that you teleport with your gear; such specification is an example of a rule being needlessly fastidious, since no teleportation effect in the game assumes that you teleport without your clothes, just as the general movement rules don't assume that you drop everything when you walk.": "有些传送效果确实规定你要带着装备传送；这种规定是一个规则不必要地急功近利的例子，因为游戏中没有任何传送效果是假定你不穿衣服就传送的，就像一般的移动规则不假定你走路时放下所有东西一样。",
	"The answer to both questions is no. Here's some elaboration on that answer.": "这两个问题的答案都是否定的。下面是对这个答案的一些阐述。",
	"Some spells and other game features create an area of effect that does something when a creature enters that area for the first time on a turn or when a creature starts its turn in that area. On the turn when you cast such a spell, you're primarily setting up hurt for your foes on later turns. {@spell Moonbeam}, for example, creates a beam of light that can damage a creature who enters the beam or who starts its turn in the beam.": "有些法术和其他游戏功能创造了一个效应区域，当一个生物在某一回合第一次进入该区域时，或当一个生物在该区域开始其回合时，该效应区域就会发生作用。在你施放这种法术的那一回合，你主要是为你的敌人在以后的回合中设置伤害。例如，{@spell Moonbeam}创造了一道光束，可以伤害进入该光束的生物或在该光束中开始其回合的生物。",
	"Reading the description of any of those spells, you might wonder whether a creature is considered to be entering the spell's area of effect if the area is created on the creature's space. And if the area of effect can be moved—as the beam of {@spell moonbeam} can—does moving it into a creature's space count as the creature entering the area? Our design intent for such spells is this: a creature enters the area of effect when the creature passes into it. Creating the area of effect on the creature or moving it onto the creature doesn't count. If the creature is still in the area at the start of its turn, it is subjected to the area's effect.": "在阅读这些法术的描述时，你可能会想，如果该区域是在生物的空间上建立的，那么生物是否会被视为进入法术的效果区域。如果效果区域可以被移动--就像{@spell moonbeam}的光束一样--那么将它移动到生物的空间中是否算作生物进入该区域？我们对这类法术的设计意图是这样的：当生物进入效果区域时，该生物就进入了该区域。在生物上创造效果区或将其移到生物上并不算数。如果该生物在其回合开始时仍在该区域内，它就会受到该区域的效果影响。",
	"The intent is that the objects are ejected from the mansion when the spell ends and appear in unoccupied spaces closest to where the door was. This intent will be reflected in future printings of the Player's Handbook.": "这样做的目的是，当咒语结束时，这些物品会被弹出宅邸，并出现在最靠近门的地方的无人空间。这一意图将反映在未来出版的《玩家手册》中。",
	"{@spell Planar binding} doesn't summon a creature. It attempts to bind a creature that is within the spell's range.": "{@spell Planar binding}不会召唤一个生物。它试图束缚一个在法术范围内的生物。",
	"Yes. Unless a spell tells you otherwise, its effect is no different for a willing creature than it is for an unwilling one.": "是的。除非某个法术告诉你，它对自愿的生物的效果与对不自愿的生物没有区别。",
	"When the creature reverts to its true form, any leftover damage is subject to that form's damage resistances, if any.": "当该生物恢复到它的真实形态时，任何剩余的伤害都会受到该形态的伤害抵抗力的影响，如果有的话。",
	"Polymorph replaces only the target's character sheet or stat block with the stat block of the chosen form. Other effects, such as other spells, still exist.": "多形性只将目标的角色表或状态块替换为所选形态的状态块。其他效果，如其他法术，仍然存在。",
	"You die.": "你死了。",
	"{@spell Prestidigitation} can create a little bauble, the nature of which is up to the spellcaster and the DM. See the {@book Trinkets table|PHB|5|Trinkets} in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} for examples.": "{@spell Prestidigitation}可以创造一个小玩意，其性质由施法者和DM决定。例子见{@book Trinkets table|PHB|5|Trinkets}中的{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}。",
	"If you use the {@book grapple|PHB|9|Grappling} or {@book shove|PHB|9|Shoving a Creature} option in the combat rules, the {@spell sanctuary} spell does end on you, since you have made an attack.": "如果你在战斗规则中使用{@book grapple|PHB|9|Grappling}或{@book shove|PHB|9|Shoving a Creature}选项，{@spell sanctuary}法术确实在你身上结束，因为你已经进行了一次攻击。",
	"It only says the blade dissipates as I throw or drop it. No. The intent is the blade vanishes when you let go of it (that's one of the meanings of the word \"drop\").": "它只是说，当我扔掉或丢掉它时，刀刃会消散。不，它的意图是，当你放开它的时候，刀就会消失（这就是 \"放下 \"这个词的含义之一）。",
	"The benefit from {@feat Polearm Master} applies to the opposite end of the weapon and always uses a {@dice d4} for damage rather than the weapon's normal damage die. This is true for a {@item quarterstaff|PHB} enhanced with {@spell shillelagh} just as it is for a normal one.": "来自{@feat Polearm Master}的好处适用于武器的另一端，并且总是使用{@dice d4}的伤害，而不是武器的正常伤害值。这对于用{@item quarterstaff|PHB}增强的{@spell shillelagh}武器来说是正确的，就像对普通武器一样。",
	"You choose the targets of a spell when you complete casting a spell, not when you start.": "你在完成施法时选择法术的目标，而不是在开始施法时。",
	"Correct. The gas doesn't immobilize a creature or prevent it from acting altogether, but the effect of the spell does limit what it can accomplish while the cloud lingers.": "正确。气体并不能使生物不能动弹，也不能完全阻止它的行动，但咒语的效果确实限制了它在云雾缭绕时能完成的事情。",
	"{@book Verbal components|PHB|10|Verbal (V)} are mystic words, not normal speech. The spell's suggestion is an intelligible utterance that is separate from the verbal component. The {@spell command} spell is the simplest example of this principle. The utterance of the verbal component is separate from, and precedes, any verbal utterance that would bring about the spell's effect.": "{@book Verbal components|PHB|10|Verbal (V)}是神秘的话语，不是正常的语言。咒语的暗示是一种可理解的话语，与言语成分分开。{@spell command}咒语是这一原则的最简单的例子。言语成分的表述与任何会带来咒语效果的言语表述是分开的，并在其之前。",
	"Failing a save against {@spell Tasha's hideous laughter} means you're {@condition incapacitated} even if you can't fall {@condition prone}.": "对{@spell Tasha's hideous laughter}的救赎失败意味着你是{@condition incapacitated}，即使你不能倒下{@condition prone}。",
	"You can maintain your telekinetic grip on a target you were already affecting, but you can't affect a new target. The sphere provides total cover that stops you from targeting anything outside it.": "你可以在你已经影响的目标上保持你的心灵感应，但你不能影响一个新的目标。球体提供了全面的掩护，使你无法瞄准球体外的任何东西。",
	"{@spell Unseen servant} creates \"an {@condition invisible}, mindless, shapeless force\". In combat, it doesn't act as a creature, an enemy, or an ally.": "{@spell Unseen servant}创造了 \"一种{@condition invisible}、无意识、无形状的力量\"。在战斗中，它不像生物、敌人或盟友那样行动。",
	"No. Natural armor doesn't fit into the categories of light, medium, and heavy armor, and when you have it, it isn't considered to be an armor you're wearing.": "不，天然盔甲不符合轻、中、重盔甲的类别，当你拥有它时，它并不被认为是你所穿的盔甲。",
	"Natural armor doesn't limit a creature's Dexterity bonus.": "自然盔甲不会限制生物的灵巧加成。",
	"Yes, that monster is still going to feel the hurt of a fall, because a fall is not a weapon.": "是的，那个怪物仍然会感受到坠落的伤害，因为坠落不是一种武器。",
	"Intentional; it's a {@creature ghoul}/{@creature ghast} thing. They're exceptionally bad at biting, compared to their claw attacks. Monsters sometimes have stat quirks like that.": "故意的；这是一个{@creature ghoul}/{@creature ghast}的事情。与它们的爪子攻击相比，它们特别不擅长咬人。怪兽有时会有这样的状态怪癖。",
	"The {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} language tables don't list every language in the D&D multiverse. The {@book Monster Manual|MM} mentions other languages, including Gnoll, Modron, Sahuagin, and Slaad.": "{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}的语言表并没有列出D&D多元宇宙中的每一种语言。{@book Monster Manual|MM}提到了其他语言，包括Gnoll, Modron, Sahuagin和Slaad。",
	"If a monster has the ability to cast a spell at will, that spell is cast using its normal casting time.": "如果一个怪物具有随意施法的能力，那么该法术的施法时间为其正常施法时间。",
	"A weapon doesn't have the finesse property unless its description says so, and using Dexterity for an attack doesn't confer the finesse property. If a weapon does have that property, you can use Strength or Dexterity with it.": "除非武器的描述有说明，否则它不具备精巧的属性，而且使用灵巧进行攻击也不会赋予精巧的属性。如果一件武器确实有这种属性，你可以用力量或灵巧来使用它。",
	"You might be thinking, \"Dragons seem pretty magical to me.\" And yes, they are extraordinary! Their description even says they're magical. But our game makes a distinction between two types of magic:": "你可能在想，\"龙对我来说似乎很神奇\"。是的，他们是不平凡的！他们的描述甚至说他们是神奇的。他们的描述甚至说他们是有魔法的。但我们的游戏对两种类型的魔法进行了区分。",
	"the background magic that is part of the D&D multiverse's physics and the physiology of many D&D creatures": "作为D&D多元宇宙的物理学和许多D&D生物的生理学的一部分的背景魔法",

	"In D&D, the first type of magic is part of nature. It is no more dispellable than the wind. A monster like a dragon exists because of that magic-enhanced nature. The second type of magic is what the rules are concerned about. When a rule refers to something being magical, it's referring to that second type. Determining whether a game feature is magical is straightforward. Ask yourself these questions about the feature:": "在D&D中，第一类魔法是自然的一部分。它不比风更容易被驱散。像龙这样的怪物之所以存在，是因为这种魔法强化了自然。第二种类型的魔法是规则所关注的。当一条规则提到某样东西有魔力时，它指的是第二种类型。判断一个游戏特征是否具有魔力是很简单的。问问自己关于该特征的这些问题。",
	"Is it a magic item?": "它是一个魔法物品吗？",
	"Is it a spell? Or does it let you create the effects of a spell that's mentioned in its description?": "它是一个法术吗？还是说它让你创造出描述中提到的法术的效果？",

	"Let's look at a {@creature Adult White Dragon||white dragon's} Cold Breath and ask ourselves those questions. First, Cold Breath isn't a magic item. Second, its description mentions no spell.

Our conclusion: Cold Breath is not considered a magical game effect, even though we know that dragons are amazing, supernatural beings.": "让我们看一下{@creature Adult White Dragon||white dragon's}冷气，并问自己这些问题。首先，\"冷气 \"不是一个魔法物品。第二，它的描述中没有提到法术。第三，它不是一个法术攻击。第四，\"魔法 \"一词在其描述中没有出现。我们的结论是。冷气不被认为是一种神奇的游戏效果，尽管我们知道龙是神奇的、超自然的生物。",

The {@creature Shadow||shadow's} Strength reduction isn't damage, because it has no effect on the target's hit points.": "不，关键一击让你掷出两次伤害骰子。一个造成伤害的效果是一个减少目标命中率的效果。{@creature Shadow||shadow's} 力量减少不是伤害，因为它对目标的命中率没有影响。",
	"The intended function of Strength Drain is that it stacks with itself, as signaled by the fact that you die if your Strength is reduced to 0 by it.": "力量耗尽的预期功能是它会与自己叠加，正如你的力量被它降低到0时就会死亡这一事实所表明的。",

	"They're both correct. The rule for scrolls ({@i DMG} \"{@book Scrolls|DMG|7|Scrolls}\") is for scrolls in general, including a {@item scroll of protection}, and it allows you to try to activate a spell if you're literate.

	"Yes. In general, bonuses stack, unless they're from the same spell (see \"{@book Combining Magical Effects|PHB|10|Combining Magical Effects}\" in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}).

	"A magic weapon gives you a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls only if its description says it does. Every magic weapon can bypass resistances and immunities to damage from nonmagical attacks, but only certain magic weapons are more accurate and damaging than their nonmagical counterparts. For example, a {@item +1 longsword} and a {@item giant slayer} both give you a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls, whereas neither a {@item flame tongue} nor a {@item frost brand} provides such a bonus.

	"A {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised} creature stops being {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised} at the end of its first turn in combat.": "一个{@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised}的生物在其战斗的第一个回合结束时停止成为{@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised}。",
	"The first step of any combat is this: the DM determines whether anyone in the combat is {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised} (reread \"{@book Combat Step by Step|PHB|9|Combat Step by Step}\" in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}). This determination happens only once during a fight and only at the beginning. In other words, once a fight starts, you can't be {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised} again, although a hidden foe can still gain the normal benefits from being unseen (see \"{@book Unseen Attackers and Targets|PHB|9|Unseen Attackers and Targets}\" in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}).": "任何战斗的第一步是这样的：DM确定战斗中是否有人是{@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised}（重读{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的\"{@book Combat Step by Step|PHB|9|Combat Step by Step}\"）。这种判断在一场战斗中只发生一次，而且只在开始时发生。换句话说，一旦战斗开始，你就不能再成为{@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised}，尽管一个隐藏的敌人仍然可以从不被看见中获得正常的好处（见{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的\"{@book Unseen Attackers and Targets|PHB|9|Unseen Attackers and Targets}\"）。",
	"To be {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised}, you must be caught off guard, usually because you failed to notice foes being stealthy or you were startled by an enemy with a special ability, such as the {@creature Gelatinous Cube||gelatinous cube's} Transparent trait, that makes it exceptionally surprising. You can be {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised} even if your companions aren't, and you aren't {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised} if even one of your foes fails to catch you unawares.": "要成为{@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised}，你必须措手不及，通常是因为你没有注意到敌人的隐身，或者你被一个具有特殊能力的敌人吓了一跳，比如{@creature Gelatinous Cube||gelatinous cube's}透明特性，使其异常惊讶。即使你的同伴没有，你也可以是{@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised}，即使你的一个敌人未能让你措手不及，你也不是{@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised}。"
