	"From the back of her soaring roc, a sky knight surveys the spire-studded cityscape below. As the morning fog dissipates under the chill autumn sun, the city spreads out as far as she can see: lofty cathedrals, squat courthouses, towering apartments, sprawling tenements, cobblestone plazas, and broken ruins where once-majestic buildings have crumbled to rubble. She imagines the teeming masses below her: humans, elves, vedalken, minotaurs, goblins, loxodons, and other peoples, as some of them rise to greet the morning and others retire after a hard night of work or play. They are the reason she is here: sworn to protect them, she leads a flight of roc riders toward the fires raging in Precinct Three. Soldiers on the ground will put out the flames, while it's her job to deal with their source: the dragon she can just make out, clinging to the spire of a distant tower. Standing in her stirrups and raising her sword, she turns her mount toward the dragon, ready to battle once again for the sake of Ravnica.": "一位天空骑士从她翱翔的大鹏背上，俯瞰下面尖顶林立的城市景观。晨雾在秋日的寒风中消散，城市在她的视线范围内蔓延开来：高大的大教堂、狭小的法院、高耸的公寓、无垠的唐人街、鹅卵石广场，以及曾经雄伟的建筑坍塌成废墟的残垣断壁。她想象着她脚下熙熙攘攘的人群：人类、精灵、维达肯人、牛头人、地精、loxodons和其他民族，他们中的一些人起来迎接早晨，另一些人在经过一夜的辛勤工作或玩耍后退休。他们是她在这里的原因：她发誓要保护他们，她带领一队大鹏鸟骑手向第三区的大火冲去。地面上的士兵将扑灭火焰，而她的工作则是处理火焰的源头：她可以看到那条龙，紧贴着远处塔的尖顶。她站在马镫上，举起她的剑，把她的坐骑转向那条龙，准备为拉夫尼卡的利益再次战斗。",
	"Ravnica is a whole new world for your Dungeons & Dragons campaign to explore. A vast, sprawling city that covers the whole of the known world, Ravnica teems with intrigue and adventure, driven by the conflicts among the ten powerful guilds that rule the city.": "拉夫尼卡是一个全新的世界，供你的龙与地下城活动探索。作为一个覆盖整个已知世界的庞大城市，拉夫尼卡充满了阴谋和冒险，由统治这个城市的十个强大的行会之间的冲突所驱动。",
	"Ravnica originally appeared as a setting for the Magic: The Gathering trading card game. It has been the subject of eight card sets: 2005–6's {@i Ravnica: City of Guilds}, {@i Guildpact}, and {@i Dissension}; 2012–13's {@i Return to Ravnica}, {@i Gatecrash}, and {@i Dragon's Maze}; and 2018–19's {@i Guilds of Ravnica} and {@i Ravnica Allegiance}. Among fans of Magic, Ravnica is one of the most popular settings, in part because the world's ten guilds strongly support the way players build Magic decks.": "拉夫尼卡最初是作为《魔法：集结号》交易卡游戏的一个场景出现。它已经成为八个卡组的主题：2005-6年的{@i Ravnica: City of Guilds}、{@i Guildpact}和{@i Dissension}；2012-13年的{@i Return to Ravnica}、{@i Gatecrash}和{@i Dragon's Maze}；以及2018-19年的{@i Guilds of Ravnica}和{@i Ravnica Allegiance}。在魔术迷中，拉夫尼卡是最受欢迎的设定之一，部分原因是世界上的十个公会强烈支持玩家构建魔术卡组的方式。",
	"As it turns out, Ravnica's ten guilds also provide a great framework for a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. They offer character archetypes, competing factions that player characters can join, and abundant opportunities to develop and drive a campaign driven by the guilds' schemes and interactions.": "事实证明，拉夫尼卡的十个公会也为龙与地下城的活动提供了一个很好的框架。它们提供了角色原型，玩家角色可以加入的竞争性派别，以及丰富的机会来发展和推动由公会的计划和互动驱动的活动。",
	"This book, then, is your point of entry into Ravnica as a setting for your D&D campaign. It guides you through the process of creating characters and adventures set here.": "那么，这本书是你进入拉夫尼卡作为D&D活动背景的起点。它指导你创建角色和冒险的过程。",
	"Chapter 1 is all about building characters. It offers new race and class options, reflecting the unique character of Ravnica as a Magic setting, and the creatures and characters seen on Magic cards. You can also use this material in any other D&D setting.": "第一章是关于建立角色的。它提供了新的种族和阶级选择，反映了拉夫尼卡作为一个魔法环境的独特特征，以及在魔法卡上看到的生物和角色。你也可以在任何其他D&D设定中使用这些材料。",
	"Race and class are only the skeleton of a character, though, and chapter 2 is aimed at helping you add flesh to those bones in order to make a character who is an integrated part of Ravnica's tapestry of guilds. The ten guilds are detailed in chapter 2, and each section includes a background that reflects a character's membership in the guild. This chapter also describes opportunities for characters to advance in rank and position within their guilds by acquiring renown.": "不过，种族和阶级只是角色的骨架，第二章的目的是帮助你在这些骨架上添加肉，以便使角色成为拉夫尼卡的行会织锦中的一个组成部分。第二章详细介绍了十个公会，每个部分都包括反映角色在公会中的成员身份的背景。这一章还描述了角色通过获得声望在其公会中提升等级和地位的机会。",
	"The focus of chapter 3 is on the city itself—and particularly on the Tenth District, which is the heart of Ravnica. The important precincts and neighborhoods of the district are described in broad overview, allowing you, as DM, plenty of leeway for developing the specifics of places and NPCs.": "第三章的重点是城市本身--特别是第十区，它是拉夫尼卡的中心。对该区的重要辖区和街区进行了广泛的描述，使你作为管理人有足够的余地来发展地方和NPC的具体情况。",
	"Chapter 4 is all about adventures in Ravnica, expanding on the material in the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} with hundreds of seeds that can grow into full-fledged adventures in the fertile ground of a DM's imagination. This chapter also includes a short starting adventure you can use to launch a Ravnica campaign.": "第四章是关于拉夫尼卡的冒险，在{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}的基础上扩展了数百个种子，这些种子可以在DM的想象力的沃土上成长为成熟的冒险。本章还包括一个简短的起始冒险，你可以用来启动拉夫尼卡的活动。",
	"Chapter 5 includes magic items and other treasures for use as rewards in a Ravnica campaign. Many of these magic items are D&D interpretations of specific Magic artifact cards—not literal translations of their mechanics from one rules system to the other, but game elements inspired by the flavor and abilities of the cards.": "第5章包括在拉夫尼卡战役中作为奖励使用的魔法物品和其他宝物。这些魔法物品中有许多是对特定魔法神器卡片的D&D解释--不是将其机制从一个规则系统翻译成另一个规则系统，而是从卡片的味道和能力中获得灵感的游戏元素。",
	"Chapter 6 presents new monsters and NPCs, again reflecting the creatures seen on Magic cards as well as the nature of each guild. The guildmaster of each guild is detailed in this chapter, as are a variety of guild members.": "第6章介绍了新的怪物和NPC，再次反映了在魔法卡上看到的生物，以及每个公会的性质。本章详细介绍了每个行会的行会会长，以及各种行会成员。",
	"In all their fantastic diversity, the cosmopolitan citizens of Ravnica go about their daily business in bustling markets and shadowy back alleys. Shambling pack animals (mammals, reptiles, insects, and bizarre hybrids alike) carry their loads through the streets, while untamed wild things lurk in verdant greenbelts, rubble-strewn ruins, and sewers. And interwoven throughout it all, ten guilds vie for power, wealth, and influence:": "在所有奇妙的多样性中，拉夫尼卡的世界公民在繁华的市场和阴暗的小巷中进行他们的日常工作。摇摇晃晃的驮运动物（哺乳动物、爬行动物、昆虫和奇怪的混血儿）带着它们的货物穿过街道，而桀骜不驯的野生动物则潜伏在青翠的绿化带、碎石遍布的废墟和下水道中。在这一切的交织中，十个行会争夺权力、财富和影响力。",
	"{@b Boros Legion}. Led by the angel {@creature Aurelia|GGR}, the Boros Legion pursues the cause of justice, not merely law enforcement. Boros serves as Ravnica's standing army.": "{@b Boros Legion}. 在天使{@creature Aurelia|GGR}的带领下，博罗军团追求的是正义，而不仅仅是执法。波罗斯作为拉夫尼卡的常备军。",

	"These ten guilds stand as the foundation of power on Ravnica. Each maintains a distinctive identity and civic function, a diverse collection of creatures, and a subculture of its own. The guilds' history is a web of wars, intrigue, and political machinations stretching over the millennia during which they have vied for control of the world. Their roles were established thousands of years ago in a magical treaty called the Guildpact, which not only assigned each guild a function, but also enforced an uneasy peace among them.": "这十个行会是拉夫尼卡的权力基础。每个公会都保持着独特的身份和公民职能，拥有不同的生物，并拥有自己的亚文化。这些公会的历史是一张由战争、阴谋和政治阴谋组成的网络，绵延数千年，期间他们争夺对世界的控制权。他们的角色是在几千年前被称为 \"行会契约 \"的魔法条约中确立的，该条约不仅为每个行会分配了职能，而且还在他们之间实施了不稳定的和平。",
	"Sometimes you might want to choose a guild at random. Here's a table you can use in those situations.": "有时你可能想随机选择一个行会。这里有一个表格，你可以在这些情况下使用。",

	"More than ten thousand years ago, a war tore across the world of Ravnica. Ten armies battled for control of the world in a conflict that ended with the creation of a magical contract of immense power known as the Guildpact. The leaders of each of the ten armies—ancient beings known as paruns—were the signatories to the Guildpact, and they became the first guildmasters of Ravnica.": "一万多年前，一场战争撕裂了拉夫尼卡世界。在这场冲突中，十支军队为争夺世界的控制权而战，最终形成了一份具有巨大力量的魔法契约，即《公会契约》。这十支军队的领导人--被称为 \"parun \"的古代生物--是《公会契约》的签署者，他们成为拉夫尼卡的第一批公会会长。",
	"The text of the Guildpact spelled out specific roles for each guild within the infrastructure of Ravnica, allowing the city to grow while the guilds coexisted in relative peace. But the true power of the Guildpact was the strength of its magically binding force, which absolutely prevented large-scale violence among the guilds.": "行会契约的文本为每个行会在拉夫尼卡的基础设施中规定了具体的角色，使城市得以发展，而各行会则相对和平地共存。但《行会契约》的真正力量在于其神奇的约束力，它绝对能阻止各行会之间的大规模暴力。",
	"For ten millennia, the city grew and flourished under this structure as the guilds evolved into unique and powerful forces, often venturing far from their original purpose.": "一万年来，城市在这种结构下成长和繁荣，因为行会演变为独特而强大的力量，经常远离其最初的目的而冒险。",
	"The signing of the Guildpact marked the beginning of the modern Ravnican calendar. Years prior to that pivotal event are denoted as \"Al Concordant,\" or AC, and counted backward from 1 AC. Years after the signing are \"Zal Concordant,\" ZC. The current date is 10,076 ZC, usually referred to as '76.": "行会契约》的签署标志着现代拉夫尼卡历法的开始。在这一关键事件之前的年份被称为 \"Al Concordant\"，即AC，并从AC1开始向后计算。签署后的年份为 \"Zal Concordant\"，即ZC。目前的日期是10,076 ZC，通常被称为76年。",
	"During the Decamillennial Celebration of 10,000 ZC, commemorating a monumental anniversary of the Guildpact's signing, the pact was broken, the ancient balance was shattered, and Ravnica was thrown into chaos. It didn't take long for wealthy power-mongers to begin seizing control of elements in the city, turning the guilds to their service instead of the other way around. Eventually, the ten-thousand-year-old guild culture and division of duties reasserted itself. The ten guilds regained their dominant positions, but without the magically binding force of the Guildpact to maintain the balance among them.": "在10,000 ZC的十年庆典中，为了纪念公会契约签署的纪念日，契约被打破了，古老的平衡被打破了，拉夫尼卡被扔进了一片混乱之中。没过多久，富有的权贵们就开始控制城市中的各种元素，让公会为他们服务，而不是反过来。最终，有着一万年历史的行会文化和职责分工重新得到了体现。十个行会重新获得了他们的主导地位，但没有了行会契约的神奇约束力来维持他们之间的平衡。",
	"Years later, in 10,075 ZC, the Izzet guildmaster discovered that Azor, founder of the Azorius Senate, had created a contingency plan that would take effect if the magic of the Guildpact were ever broken. An intricate network of ley lines sprawling across the districts of Ravnica, called the Implicit Maze, offered a test to the guilds: if they could cooperate to solve the maze, they would secure the power of a new Guildpact. That power was eventually bestowed—incarnated, actually—in the person of Jace Beleren, who became the Living Guildpact. His word became the binding law of Ravnica. Any law he verbally confirmed became magically unbreakable, and the responsibility of keeping the guilds in balance fell to him.": "多年后，在10,075 ZC，伊泽特公会的会长发现，阿索里乌斯元老院的创始人阿索尔创造了一个应急计划，如果公会契约的魔法被打破，这个计划就会生效。一个错综复杂的雷系网络遍布拉夫尼卡的各个地区，被称为 \"隐秘迷宫\"，为各公会提供了一个考验：如果他们能合作解决这个迷宫，他们就能获得新的公会契约的力量。这种力量最终被赋予了--实际上是化身为杰斯-贝勒伦，他成为了活着的公会契约。他的话成为了拉夫尼卡的约束性法律。他口头确认的任何法律在魔法上都是牢不可破的，而保持公会平衡的责任也落在了他身上。",
	"Jace is a Planeswalker, with the ability to travel from world to world, and his attention never remains focused on Ravnica for long. Thanks to his involvement with other Planeswalkers, he spends extended periods of time away from Ravnica. During his absences, Ravnica has to fend for itself, and that means that the guilds return to their old habits of fighting with each other over the smallest scraps of influence that could tilt the balance of power in their favor.": "杰斯是一个星球行者，有能力从一个世界到另一个世界，而他的注意力从来没有长时间集中在拉夫尼卡。由于他与其他行星行者的关系，他有很长一段时间不在拉夫尼卡。在他不在的时候，拉夫尼卡不得不自求多福，这意味着各行会又回到了他们的老习惯，为争夺最小的影响力碎片而相互争斗，而这些碎片可能会使权力的天平向他们倾斜。",
	"These conflicts erupt in a variety of forms. Sometimes guilds clash violently in the streets: Boros forces try to quell Gruul riots, Azorius arresters raid a {@creature Rakdos|GGR} murder show, or Selesnya forces come together to repel a Golgari incursion. More often, sinister plots unfold in secret, through infiltration, sabotage, theft, and deception. Schemes are hidden beneath layers of other schemes, making the intention behind them nearly impossible to discover. The guildmasters are often the source of these plots, but sometimes subordinates attack other guilds to gain more influence within their own. In the absence of the Guildpact, some people believe that it's only a matter of time until these schemes and skirmishes escalate into all-out war on a scale that Ravnica hasn't known for ten millennia.": "这些冲突以各种形式爆发出来。有时，行会在街上发生激烈的冲突。Boros的部队试图平息格鲁尔的暴乱，Azorius的逮捕者突袭了一场{@creature Rakdos|GGR}谋杀秀，或者Selesnya的部队一起击退了Golgari的入侵。更多的时候，险恶的阴谋是通过渗透、破坏、偷窃和欺骗的方式秘密展开的。阴谋被隐藏在其他阴谋的层层叠叠之下，使其背后的意图几乎无法被发现。行会会长通常是这些阴谋的源头，但有时下属也会攻击其他行会，以获得自己行会内更大的影响力。在没有公会契约的情况下，有些人认为，这些阴谋和小规模冲突升级为全面战争只是时间问题，拉夫尼卡已经有一万年没有这样的规模了。",
	"With the precarious peace always hanging in the balance, opportunities abound for adventurers to serve their guilds or advance their own agendas. Whether delving into the dungeons of the undercity, pursuing assassins through the bustling streets, negotiating accords among the rich and powerful, or sniffing out corruption in the halls of law, the characters in a Ravnica campaign have a world of adventure to explore.": "由于不稳定的和平总是悬而未决，冒险者们有很多机会为他们的公会服务或推进自己的议程。无论是深入地下城的地牢，在繁华的街道上追捕刺客，在富人和权贵之间谈判协议，还是在法律的殿堂里嗅出腐败，拉夫尼卡战役中的人物都有一个冒险的世界可以探索。",

	"Ravnica is a vast city, covering the entirety of the world in many layers of construction, from deep sewers and catacombs to sky-raking spires. No single map can encompass the tremendous scope of its sprawl, and its borders (if it has any) are unknown, except possibly to those who live near the edges.": "拉夫尼卡是一座巨大的城市，从深邃的下水道和地下墓穴到高耸入云的尖塔，许多建筑覆盖了整个世界。没有一张地图能涵盖它的巨大范围，它的边界（如果它有的话）也是未知的，除了那些住在边缘的人可能知道。",
	"The story of Ravnica focuses on its core. Sometimes called the city proper, this core is divided into ten districts, each of which is a huge urban environment in its own right. The districts are named in simple numerical order from the First to the Tenth. No correlation exists between the ten guilds and the ten districts; all ten guilds are active in all ten districts. The Tenth District, in particular, is a hotbed of activity where all the guilds maintain their primary headquarters. It is the focus of chapter 3.": "拉夫尼卡的故事集中在它的核心。这个核心有时被称为城市本身，它被分为十个区，每个区都是一个巨大的城市环境。这些地区以简单的数字顺序命名，从第一区到第十区。十个行会和十个区之间不存在任何关联；所有十个行会都在所有十个区活动。特别是第十区，它是一个活动的温床，所有的行会都在这里设有主要的总部。它是第三章的重点。",
	"A huge avenue called the Transguild Promenade runs through all ten districts, making it the most notable landmark for navigation through the city's heart. Lined with markets, small parks, and colonnades, the Promenade is a commercial thoroughfare used to transport loads of cargo. On celebration days, it becomes the city's most popular parade route. Even when guild conflicts run hot, Ravnicans respect the sanctity of the Promenade as neutral ground.": "一条名为 \"跨行会长廊 \"的巨大大道贯穿所有十个区，使其成为穿越城市中心的最显著的导航地标。长廊两旁有市场、小公园和柱廊，是一条用于运输货物的商业大道。在庆典日，它成为城市最受欢迎的游行路线。即使在公会冲突激烈的时候，拉夫尼科人也会尊重长廊作为中立地的神圣性。",
	"Beyond the core are an uncounted number of other districts, which originated as outlying cities that gradually melded into the expanding metropolis. Well-known districts outside the core include the Smelting District, Irbitov (the mausoleum district), and Jezeru (the lake district).": "在核心区之外，还有不计其数的其他地区，这些地区起源于外围城市，逐渐融入不断扩张的大都市。核心区以外的著名地区包括冶炼区、伊尔比托夫（陵墓区）和杰泽鲁（湖区）。",
	"Districts, whether in the city proper or beyond it, are the fundamental configurations that define Ravnica. They are informally divided into various quarters, neighborhoods, and the like. Some of these areas extend across district boundaries. Deadbridge, for example, existed as a well-defined neighborhood before Ravnica City was formally divided into ten districts, and that division was made without consideration of Deadbridge's informally acknowledged boundaries. Part of Deadbridge, known as Deadbridge Chasm, occupies much of the Tenth District's Precinct Six, but it extends out into the neighboring area. Similar neighborhoods, both within and outside the city proper, include the Steambath Quarter, the Wrights' Quarter, and Mahovna, the Haven of Moss.": "地区，无论是在城市本身还是在城市之外，都是定义拉夫尼卡的基本配置。它们被非正式地划分为各种区、街区等。其中一些区域跨越了区界。例如，在拉夫尼卡城被正式划分为十个区之前，死桥（Deadbridge）就作为一个明确的街区存在，而这种划分没有考虑到死桥非正式承认的边界。死桥的一部分被称为 \"死桥鸿沟\"，占据了第十区第六区的大部分区域，但它也延伸到了邻近地区。类似的街区，无论是在城市内部还是外部，都包括Steambath Quarter、Wright'Quarter和Mahovna，Moss的避难所。",

The nicer neighborhoods of the city enjoy central heating and plumbing (thanks to the work of the Izzet League), elevators, and spacious apartments. Even poorer neighborhoods boast clean and smooth roads and sturdy construction. No one needs to go hungry in Ravnica, because the Golgari Swarm provides a bare minimum of sustenance to anyone who can't afford better food, though it is best not to think too much about where the thick gruel comes from. (In practical terms, even a character who can't afford more than a wretched lifestyle doesn't need to go hungry.)": "科技的进步和复杂的魔法为拉夫尼卡的人们提供了便利，这些便利对于大多数D&D世界的人们来说都是非同寻常的，除了像Eberron这样的世界。城市中较好的社区享有中央供暖和管道（感谢伊泽特联盟的工作）、电梯和宽敞的公寓。即使是较贫穷的社区也拥有干净平整的道路和坚固的建筑。在拉夫尼卡，没有人需要挨饿，因为戈尔加里蜂群为那些买不起更好食物的人提供了最低限度的食物，尽管最好不要过多地考虑这些浓稠的粥是怎么来的。(从实际情况来看，即使是一个负担不起更多可怜的生活方式的角色也不需要挨饿）。",
	"The citizens of Ravnica enjoy plenty of leisure time, and the city offers an abundance of ways to fill it. Ravnica features restaurants with extensive collections of fine wines, cafés serving coffee and tea, street vendors offering portable meals, and bakeries that sell a wide variety of breads and pastries.

Even though some guild leaders (especially the villainous ones) might talk about exterminating or dominating other guilds, many guild members have family, lovers, friends, and acquaintances among other guilds. Those positive associations can bind an adventuring party together.": "虽然行会之间的冲突推动了拉夫尼卡战役中的大部分行动，但重要的是不要让这种紧张关系在冒险者队伍中造成过多的摩擦。D&D游戏依赖于玩家之间的合作，因此，尽管玩家角色在公会归属、理想和议程方面存在差异，但找到将他们团结起来的共同点是很有帮助的。尽管一些公会的领导者（尤其是反派）可能会谈论消灭或支配其他公会，但许多公会成员在其他公会中都有家人、爱人、朋友和熟人。这些积极的关联可以将一个冒险队伍捆绑在一起。",

	"Not one of the paruns of the ten guilds was human, although the Ghost Council of the Orzhov Syndicate is of human origin. Likewise, no current guildmaster is human.

	"As stated in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, bonds represent your connections to people, places, and events in the world. Contacts are people you have a connection to, but they're not necessarily bonds. People can be bonds if they inspire you, motivate you, or make you act against your best interests. (They can represent flaws if their existence amounts to a weakness for you.) Contacts, in comparison, are simply people you know. They might be friends, rivals, or even family members, but their relationship with you is rarely as strong as with a bond.": "如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}所述，债券代表你与世界上的人、地方和事件的联系。联系人是与你有联系的人，但他们不一定是纽带。如果人们激励你、鼓舞你，或使你的行为违背你的最佳利益，他们就可以成为纽带。(如果他们的存在相当于你的弱点，他们就可以代表缺陷。）相比之下，联系人只是你认识的人。他们可能是朋友、对手，甚至是家庭成员，但他们与你的关系很少像纽带那样牢固。",
	"Although the tables of contacts in this chapter describe nonplayer characters who are members of guilds (your own and others), you are likely to acquire guildless contacts as well.

Then you'll roll once on the table of contacts from other guilds. That contact could be either an ally or a rival, or you might instead gain a third contact from your own guild.": "你将在联系人表中为你的公会掷两次骰子，除非你是在迪米尔家族（在该公会的章节中解释）。你的第一次滚动会给你一个盟友。你的第二次滚动会给你一个对手，他可能是友好的、嫉妒的或敌对的。(这些人有可能是同一个人；例如，一个人可能对你很友好，但同时又嫉妒你的成功）。然后，你将在其他公会的联系人表上滚动一次。这个联系人可能是盟友或对手，或者你可能从你自己的公会获得第三个联系人。",
	"The guilds might be considered the heart and soul of Ravnica, but they aren't all that makes up the city. Many citizens choose not to join a guild—some because they can't be bothered, and others because they have philosophical objections to the very idea of guilds. The so-called guildless are especially common in areas that might be considered rural: places farther from the heart of the city and the larger exurban districts. But even in the city's heart, some guildless citizens actively oppose the influence of the guilds, blaming the world's strife and suffering on an elite hierarchy that seeks to take control, consolidate wealth, and fragment a populace against itself. The numbers of the guildless include people engaged in a wide variety of trades and services that aren't managed and regulated by the guilds, from baking to cartography. University professors, guides, traders, and bartenders might be guildless. Criminal gangs set themselves up as rivals to the Orzhov, and even military forces operate independent of guild control, serving as neighborhood police forces or mercenaries for hire. About half of Ravnica's population is guildless. That proportion is higher for some races than others: nearly all elves, for example, belong to the Golgari, Selesnya, or Simic guilds, but a majority of goblins are guildless. Loxodons tend to have a strong sense of community, so they readily join guilds. And when they don't, they join groups of another sort, such as mercenary companies or cults. Simic hybrids are all created within the Simic Combine, so it's rare for them not to be part of it.": "公会可能被认为是拉夫尼卡的核心和灵魂，但它们并不是构成这个城市的全部。许多市民选择不加入公会--有些是因为他们不愿意，有些是因为他们在哲学上反对公会的想法。所谓的无公会者在可能被认为是农村的地区特别常见：远离城市中心的地方和较大的郊区。但即使在城市中心，一些无公会的市民也积极反对公会的影响，将世界上的纷争和苦难归咎于精英阶层，他们试图控制、巩固财富，并使民众自相残杀。无公会的人数包括从事各种不受公会管理和规范的贸易和服务的人，从烘烤到制图。大学教授、导游、商人和酒保都可能是无公会者。犯罪团伙将自己设定为Orzhov的对手，甚至军事力量也独立于公会控制之外，充当附近的警察部队或受雇的雇佣兵。拉夫尼卡大约一半的人口是无公会的。一些种族的这一比例高于其他种族：例如，几乎所有的精灵都属于戈尔加里、塞勒斯尼亚或西米克公会，但大多数地精都没有公会。Loxodons倾向于有强烈的社区意识，所以他们很容易加入公会。如果他们不这样做，他们就会加入另一种团体，如雇佣兵公司或邪教。西米克混血儿都是在西米克联合体内创造的，所以他们很少不成为联合体的一部分。",

	"The various ranks within the guilds describe the range of tasks you might perform, from testing experimental Izzet weaponry to leading a squad of Boros soldiers into battle.

Chapter 4 includes information for the DM about missions appropriate for your guild.": "行会中的各种等级描述了你可能执行的任务范围，从测试实验性的伊泽特武器到带领一队波洛斯士兵上战场。当你被分配到一个涉及冒险的任务时--抛开你的公会财产并将自己置于危险之中--你完成了这个任务，你在该公会的声望值就会增加2。",
	"Other tasks that don't involve adventuring can also improve your renown score. You can use the time between adventures to improve your renown within your guild by performing these tasks, as well as by socializing with prominent people in the guild.

	"At your DM's discretion, you might also have a renown score in a guild you don't belong to. You can't ever formally advance in rank within another guild, but a high renown score can earn you additional contacts, favors, and other benefits. This option can be useful in an intrigue-heavy campaign where the adventurers spend a lot of time trying to influence the leaders of various guilds.": "根据DM的决定，你也可能在一个你不属于的公会里有一个声望值。你不能在另一个行会中正式提升等级，但高的声望分可以为你赢得额外的联系、恩惠和其他好处。这个选项在阴谋重重的战役中很有用，因为冒险者要花很多时间去影响各个行会的领袖。",

They provide you with lodging and food in dire circumstances and pay for your funeral if needed. If you are accused of a crime, your guild offers legal support, as long as a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime was justifiable.": "{@b Renown 3 or Higher}. 当你在自己的公会中的声望分数至少达到3分时，你就是公会中成熟的、受尊敬的成员。公会的其他成员默认对你有友好的态度。(尽管你的声望很高，但公会的个别成员可能有理由不喜欢你）。他们在恶劣的情况下为你提供住宿和食物，如果需要的话，还会为你的葬礼买单。如果你被指控犯罪，你的公会会提供法律支持，只要能很好地证明你是无辜的或犯罪是合理的。",

	"Other guilds have positions of honor that characters can apply for if their renown score is high enough.

Ultimately, the DM decides whether a character qualifies for such a role, with a certain renown score as a minimum requirement.": "其他行会有一些荣誉职位，如果他们的声望值足够高，就可以申请。并非每个塞勒斯尼亚公会的成员都渴望成为sagittar（被派去守卫公会重要地点的弓箭手），但任何符合前提条件的角色都可以申请这个职位。最终，DM决定一个角色是否有资格担任这样的角色，一定的声望值是最低要求。",
	"Several guilds provide a salary among the benefits of renown within the guild. The salary is described as sufficient to maintain a lifestyle of a certain level. If you earn a salary, you can live at the specified lifestyle without paying the normal daily expenditure. See {@book chapter 5|PHB|5|Expenses} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} for more information on lifestyle expenses.": "一些行会在行会内的声誉福利中提供工资。工资被描述为足以维持一定水平的生活方式。如果你赚取了工资，你就可以在指定的生活方式下生活，而无需支付正常的日常开支。关于生活方式支出的更多信息，请参见{@book chapter 5|PHB|5|Expenses}的{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}。",
	"A prominent position in a guild often allows you to call on the services of lower-ranking members to assist you in your work. When you do, they are assumed to be loyal followers who help you to the best of their ability. Some of them are assigned to help you for the duration of a single task or mission, while others are under your permanent command, staffing a laboratory, workshop, or garrison where you are in charge. Depending on their role, they might help you in dangerous situations (like combat) or flee from them. You might assign them to perform tasks in your absence, which could include undertaking research, looking for witnesses to a crime, or carrying out a small-scale raid, for example, depending on their role and capabilities. You carry the responsibility for their lives and welfare, ultimately, and if the guild decides that you are abusing your authority and mistreating the members beneath you, you might lose renown, lose your rank or status in the guild, or even be cast out of the guild.": "在行会中的重要地位往往允许你调用低级成员的服务来协助你的工作。当你这样做时，他们被认为是忠诚的追随者，会尽其所能地帮助你。他们中的一些人被指派在单一任务或使命期间帮助你，而另一些人则在你的长期指挥下，为你负责的实验室、车间或驻军配备人员。根据他们的角色，他们可能在危险的情况下帮助你（如战斗），也可能从危险中逃离。你可能会指派他们在你不在的时候执行任务，这可能包括进行研究，寻找犯罪的证人，或者进行一次小规模的突袭，例如，根据他们的角色和能力。你最终要对他们的生活和福利负责，如果公会决定你滥用权力，虐待你下面的成员，你可能会失去声望，失去你在公会的等级或地位，甚至被赶出公会。",
	"If you commit a serious offense against your guild or its members, you might lose renown within the guild. The extent of the loss depends on the infraction and is left to the DM's discretion. A character's renown score with a guild can never drop below 0. If your renown score drops below the threshold for a rank or privilege you have attained, you lose that benefit. Even if you regain the lost renown, you might find it more difficult to again secure a position or rank you have previously lost.": "如果你对你的公会或其成员犯下严重的违法行为，你可能会在公会中失去声望。损失的程度取决于违规行为，由管理员决定。如果你的声望值低于你已经获得的等级或特权的阈值，你就会失去该利益。即使你重新获得了失去的声望，你可能会发现再次获得你以前失去的职位或等级更加困难。",
	"As you're playing a character associated with one of the guilds, think about your character's relationship with the guild. Guild members can be grouped into four categories, depending on their motivations and priorities: loyalists, opportunists, rebels, and anomalies. Which one of these descriptions best fits your character?": "当你在扮演一个与某个行会有关的角色时，要考虑你的角色与行会的关系。行会成员可以根据他们的动机和优先次序分为四类：忠诚者、机会主义者、反叛者和异常者。这些描述中的哪一个最适合你的角色？",
	"{@b Loyalists} join a guild because they firmly believe in the guild's ideals and want to advance its goals. Their membership in the guild is a badge of identity for them. They're typically of the races and classes most strongly associated with the guild, and their personality traits and ideals fall in line with the suggestions in this chapter. An idealistic human or a minotaur paladin in the Boros Legion is an example of a loyalist.": "{@b Loyalists}加入行会是因为他们坚信行会的理想，并希望推动行会的目标。他们在行会中的成员身份是他们的一个徽章。他们通常属于与公会联系最紧密的种族和阶级，他们的个性特征和理想与本章的建议相一致。一个理想主义的人类或博罗军团中的牛头人圣骑士就是一个忠诚者的例子。",
	"{@b Opportunists} join a guild based on what they can gain from becoming members. Every guild offers its members something—whether concrete benefits such as opportunities for wealth or more subtle, intangible rewards such as social status—and getting that something is the primary motivation for this type of character. Opportunists often pay lip service to the ideals and goals of the guild, looking out for themselves first and the guild second (at best). A selfish human fighter who uses membership in the Boros Legion as an excuse to bully and steal from others would be an opportunist.": "{@b Opportunists}加入一个公会是基于他们能从成为会员中获得什么。每个公会都会为其成员提供一些东西--无论是具体的利益，如获得财富的机会，还是更微妙的、无形的奖励，如社会地位，而获得这些东西是这类人物的主要动机。机会主义者往往对公会的理想和目标口惠而实不至，首先为自己着想，其次才是为公会着想（最好是）。一个自私的人类战士，把加入波罗斯军团作为欺负和偷窃他人的借口，这就是机会主义者。",
	"{@b Rebels} love the guilds they're in but don't conform to guild expectations. They might be good-hearted idealists trying to bend a shady guild toward nobler pursuits, or they might be selfish egotists hoping to direct the guild's actions toward promoting their own interests. Most rebels are typical members of the guild in terms of race and class, but they vary from type when it comes to personalities and ideals. A Boros legionnaire with tyrannical tendencies who thinks the Boros should enforce justice with an iron fist would be a rebel.": "{@b Rebels}热爱他们所在的行会，但不符合行会的期望。他们可能是心地善良的理想主义者，试图让一个阴暗的公会屈服于更高尚的追求，也可能是自私的利己主义者，希望将公会的行动导向促进自己的利益。大多数反叛者在种族和阶级方面都是典型的公会成员，但当涉及到个性和理想时，他们的类型就不同了。一个有暴虐倾向的博罗军团成员，认为博罗军团应该用铁拳来执行正义，这就是叛军。",
	"{@b Anomalies} are individuals who join guilds contrary to all expectations. Their race or class (or both) is outside the norm for their guild, but their personalities and ideals fall perfectly in line; that's why they joined. A vedalken paladin in the Boros Legion, or an Ordruun minotaur in the Orzhov Syndicate, would fall into this category.": "{@b Anomalies}是加入公会的个人，与所有的期望相反。他们的种族或阶级（或两者）超出了他们公会的标准，但他们的个性和理想却完全符合；这就是他们加入的原因。Boros军团中的维达肯圣骑士，或者Orzhov辛迪加中的奥德鲁恩牛头人，都属于这种类型。",
	"Some adventurers do exactly what they're told, spending their careers doing the bidding of their guild superiors. Most adventuring characters, though, prefer more independence.

You also gain access to your new guild spells.": "你获得了新行会成员的特权。这些包括你的新公会授予的背景功能，尽管你的DM可能会决定你需要一段时间才能获得全部好处。例如，一个离开另一个公会加入格鲁尔家族的角色不会立即知道瓦砾地带的方式，而是要随着时间的推移获得这种熟悉感。你还可以获得新公会的法术。",

	"Officer Lavinia stood before the enormous double doors that led into the highest spire of New Prahv, the lair of the guildmaster. To look at her, nothing would seem out of place: her cape spilled elegantly from her officer's armor, her sword shone like a decorative piece one would hang above a mantel, and her three-sided medals displayed her district-spanning rank.": "拉维尼娅警官站在巨大的双扇门前，这扇门通向新普拉赫夫的最高尖顶，即公会会长的巢穴。看着她，没有什么会显得不合适：她的披风优雅地从她的军官盔甲上溢出来，她的剑像挂在壁炉上的装饰品一样闪闪发光，她的三面奖章显示了她跨越地区的等级。",
	"The first guildmaster of the Azorius Senate was a sphinx named Azor. He was the author of the original Guildpact, as well as the creator of the elaborate contingency plan that resulted in the creation of the Living Guildpact. The Azorius Senate was meant to carry on his legacy by serving as the legislative body of Ravnica.": "阿索瑞斯元老院的第一任会长是一位名叫阿索尔的斯芬克斯。他是最初《公会契约》的作者，也是精心设计的应急计划的创造者，该计划导致了《生活公会契约》的诞生。阿索里乌斯参议院是为了继承他的遗产，作为拉夫尼卡的立法机构。",

	"The {@b Lyev Column} enforces the law as Ravnica's police force. The many-leveled hierarchy of the Lyev Column includes arresters, investigators, officers, and lawmages.

	"The Azorius Senate's ultimate goal is the perfection of society. They want to protect the people of Ravnica and foster a community of peace and harmony. A society's values, they contend, are reflected in the laws it creates. Something is good if it is lawful. To the Azorius, the highest virtue is a society built on stability and order, and the guild's elaborate system of laws is structured to prevent wrongdoing first and foremost, even at the expense of certain liberties. The Azorius can act as a benevolent proactive force that keeps evildoers in check, but it can also act as an oppressive bureaucratic force that stifles freedom and expression.": "阿佐里乌斯参议院的最终目标是社会的完善。他们希望保护拉夫尼卡的人民，培养一个和平与和谐的社区。他们认为，一个社会的价值观反映在其制定的法律中。只要是合法的东西就是好东西。对Azorius来说，最高的美德是一个建立在稳定和秩序之上的社会，公会精心设计的法律体系首先是为了防止错误行为，甚至以牺牲某些自由为代价。阿佐里乌斯可以作为一种仁慈的主动力量，使坏人受到制约，但它也可以作为一种压迫性的官僚力量，扼杀自由和表达。",
	"In the absence of the Living Guildpact, the Azorius are uncertain who is supposed to maintain balance among the guilds. As a group, they are convinced that the system can't be disrupted, but they are challenged by the reality that the one person who is meant to hold their world together never seems to be around. The Azorius Senate is invoking emergency powers with increasing frequency, and the Lyev Column's enforcers are wielding an ever-growing amount of influence.": "在没有活着的行会契约的情况下，Azorius人不确定谁应该维持各行会之间的平衡。作为一个团体，他们相信这个系统是不会被破坏的，但是他们受到了现实的挑战，那就是那个要维持他们世界的人似乎从来没有出现过。Azorius参议院越来越频繁地引用紧急权力，而Lyev Column的执行者们正在发挥着越来越大的影响力。",
	"The Azorius guild embraces the belief that Ravnican society has come too far to succumb to chaos. Civilization can be saved only through the guidance of a strong, safety-focused government. In the mind of the Azorius, the threat of chaos is imminent. They believe it is time to face facts and do whatever is necessary to protect the people and preserve the force of law.": "阿佐里乌斯公会相信，拉夫尼卡社会已经走到了尽头，不能再向混乱屈服。只有通过一个强大的、以安全为中心的政府的指导，才能拯救文明。在Azorius的心目中，混乱的威胁迫在眉睫。他们认为现在是时候面对现实，采取一切必要的措施来保护人民，维护法律的力量。",
	"The Azorius, as always, see agents of disorder as their greatest enemies. They have cracked down on the Gruul Clans and imposed a variety of creatively written laws outlawing that guild's presence in as many public places as possible. The Azorius also abhor the satirical shows of the {@creature Rakdos|GGR} (in part because the Azorius are frequently ridiculed by {@creature Rakdos|GGR} performers) and attempt to curb them with new decrees about public performances. In response to attempts by other guilds to edge their way around the system, the Azorius routinely create new laws to support or countermand old ones.": "像往常一样，阿佐里乌斯将混乱的代理人视为他们最大的敌人。他们对格鲁尔家族进行了打击，并实施了各种创造性的法律，在尽可能多的公共场所宣布该公会为非法。阿佐里乌斯也憎恨{@creature Rakdos|GGR}的讽刺表演（部分原因是阿佐里乌斯经常被{@creature Rakdos|GGR}的表演者嘲笑），并试图用有关公共表演的新法令来遏制它们。为了应对其他行会试图绕过该系统的做法，Azorius经常制定新的法律来支持或抵制旧的法律。",
	"You might enjoy playing a character who belongs to the Azorius Senate if one or more of the following statements are true:": "如果以下一个或多个说法是真的，你可能会喜欢扮演一个属于阿佐里乌斯参议院的角色。",
	"You're drawn to the idea of a hard-bitten police officer trying to impose order on a chaotic world.": "你被一个强硬的警察试图在一个混乱的世界上施加秩序的想法所吸引。",
	"You like the idea of using magic to control enemies.": "你喜欢用魔法来控制敌人的想法。",
	"You like playing enchanter wizards, clerics of law, or unbending paladins.": "你喜欢玩魔法师、法律牧师或不屈的圣骑士。",
	"As a recruit to the Azorius Senate, you were quickly immersed in the law. You might have clerked for a judge or a legislator, been an apprentice to a practitioner of law magic, studied rhetoric with diplomats, or trained to patrol the streets and enforce the law. As your training comes to an end and your adventuring career begins, you must decide whether to focus on law enforcement or to operate primarily within the bureaucracy of the senate.": "作为Azorius元老院的新人，你很快就沉浸在法律之中。你可能是法官或立法者的书记员，是法律魔法从业者的学徒，与外交官一起学习修辞，或者接受训练在街上巡逻和执法。当你的训练结束，你的冒险生涯开始时，你必须决定是专注于执法还是主要在参议院的官僚体系中运作。",
	"Most Azorius adventurers belong to the guild's police force. They are soldiers or spellcasters who patrol the city in teams or singly, preventing crimes or stopping them in progress. If you want to pursue a career in law enforcement, choose the path of the lawmage, the precognitive mage, or the arrester.": "大多数Azorius冒险者属于公会的警察部队。他们是士兵或施法者，以团队或单人形式在城市中巡逻，防止犯罪或阻止犯罪的发生。如果你想从事执法工作，请选择法师、预知法师或逮捕者的道路。",
	"As a spellcaster in the Azorius Senate, you use your magic to compel or restrain malefactors and scofflaws (perhaps as a wizard specialized in the School of Enchantment). You might also use your magic to protect Azorius soldiers and innocent bystanders from harm (perhaps as a wizard specialized in the School of Abjuration or as a cleric of the Order Domain, which is described in {@book chapter 1|GGR|1}). In any case, you're called a lawmage, and you can aspire to the title of justiciar and then deputy as your standing within the guild increases.": "作为阿索里乌斯元老院的施法者，你用你的魔法来蛊惑或约束坏人和恶棍（也许是作为魔法学院的专业巫师）。你也可以用你的魔法来保护Azorius的士兵和无辜的旁观者免受伤害（也许是作为一个专攻咒语学校的巫师，或者是作为一个秩序领域的牧师，这在{@book chapter 1|GGR|1}中有所描述）。在任何情况下，你都被称为法师，随着你在行会中地位的提高，你可以渴望获得justiciar的头衔，然后是副手。",
	"If you are a spellcaster with some ability to glimpse the future (perhaps a wizard specialized in the School of Divination or a cleric of the Knowledge Domain), you can use this ability to try to prevent crime before it occurs, serving as a precognitive mage. These mages occupy a small niche on the periphery of the guild, and the guild hasn't developed a bureaucratic structure to accommodate them, so they advance through the same ranks as lawmages.": "如果你是一个具有某种窥视未来能力的施法者（也许是一个专攻占卜学派的巫师或知识领域的牧师），你可以利用这种能力来试图在犯罪发生之前进行预防，作为一个预知法师。这些法师占据了公会外围的一个小角落，而且公会还没有发展出一个官僚结构来容纳他们，所以他们和法师一样通过等级晋升。",
	"As a martial character, you can serve as an arrester in the Azorius Senate. You might be a fighter (of any martial archetype) or a paladin who has sworn the Oath of Vengeance, for example. Arresters maintain the peace by removing threats—both actual and potential—identified through regular patrols, citizen reports, and occasionally alerts from the precognitive mages. As you gain the respect of your superiors, you can be promoted to the rank of officer or imperator.": "作为一个武将角色，你可以在阿索里乌斯元老院担任逮捕者。例如，你可以是一个战士（任何武术原型）或一个发誓要复仇的圣骑士。逮捕者通过定期巡逻、市民报告以及偶尔来自预知法师的警报来消除实际和潜在的威胁，从而维护和平。当你获得上级的尊重时，你可以被提升为军官或御林军的级别。",
	"Bureaucracy might seem like the opposite of adventure, but it is possible to immerse yourself in the life of a civil servant in the Azorius Senate and still live an adventurous life. You might be a mild-mannered judge's clerk or scribe who got caught up in a whirlwind chain of events beyond your control, or you might moonlight as a vigilante in defiance of the law you are supposed to uphold. Or you could serve a diplomatic function as an elocutor.": "官僚主义似乎是冒险的反面，但有可能让你沉浸在阿索里乌斯参议院的公务员生活中，仍然过着冒险的生活。你可能是一个温和的法官文员或抄写员，被卷入了一连串超出你控制的事件中，或者你可能兼职做一个义务兵，无视你应该维护的法律。或者，你可以作为一名口才师履行外交职能。",
	"As a skilled orator and diplomat (perhaps a bard of the College of Lore), you can put your talents to use in the guild as an elocutor. The Azorius are known for their measured, patient speech, and the elocutors are the primary voice through which the senate communicates with the other guilds and the people of Ravnica. Thus, you might serve as an emissary from the Azorius to another guild, working to settle trade or territorial agreements, temporary alliances, and the like. You might have the task of securing the support of key senators for a particular piece of legislation or treaty. Well-established elocutors can be rewarded with the rank of scribe or emissary.": "作为一个熟练的演说家和外交家（也许是洛尔学院的吟游诗人），你可以在公会中发挥你的才能，成为一名口才师。阿索里乌斯人以其有分寸、有耐心的演讲而闻名，而口才师是元老院与其他公会和拉夫尼卡人民交流的主要渠道。因此，你可能会作为阿佐里乌斯的使者前往其他公会，致力于解决贸易或领土协议、临时联盟等问题。你的任务可能是确保关键参议员对某项立法或条约的支持。成熟的口才者可以得到文士或使者的奖励。",

An elocutor (bard) could round out the party, serving as the group's negotiator and spokesperson.": "一个完全由Azorius成员组成的冒险队伍可以是一个专门用于执法的团队。一名士兵（战士或圣骑士）和一名法师（巫师）将构成这个队伍的核心，由一名帮助指导他们任务的预知法师（牧师）支持。一个吟游诗人可以充实这个队伍，作为这个队伍的谈判者和发言人。",
	"The heads of the three columns of the Azorius Senate are called arbiters or capitals. The arbiter of the Sova Column (the judiciary) is Leonos II, a wise and kind human judge and lawmage who takes pains to consider all perspectives before issuing a judgment—even the perspectives of the spirits of the dead, with whom he can communicate. He is patient and utterly loyal to the guild. The Jelenn Column (the legislature) is led by a vedalken lawmage named Uzana, renowned for a nearly perfect memory. She has memorized every statute of Azorius law, and much of her speech is quotations from those statutes. The hussar commander Agmand Sarv is the arbiter of the Lyev Column, the senate's law enforcement branch. Despite the fact that he has never been in combat, he has earned a reputation as a brilliant military strategist. His tactical genius is unquestioned, but his lack of battle experience did cause some controversy among the soldiers and lawmages of the Lyev Column when he was appointed to be its head.": "阿索里乌斯元老院的三个柱子的负责人被称为仲裁者或首领。索瓦柱（司法机构）的仲裁者是莱昂诺斯二世，他是一位睿智而善良的人类法官和法师，在作出判决前会不厌其烦地考虑所有的观点--甚至包括死灵的观点，他可以与死灵沟通。他很有耐心，对公会完全忠诚。杰伦纵队（立法机构）由一位名叫乌扎娜的维达肯法师领导，她以几乎完美的记忆力而闻名。她已经记住了阿索里乌斯的每一条法规，她的大部分讲话都是引用这些法规的内容。轻骑兵指挥官阿格曼德-萨夫（Agmand Sarv）是元老院执法部门利耶夫纵队的仲裁者。尽管他从未参加过战斗，但他已经赢得了杰出的军事战略家的声誉。他的战术天才是毋庸置疑的，但当他被任命为里耶夫纵队的负责人时，他缺乏战斗经验确实在士兵和法师中引起了一些争议。",
	"By gaining renown as a member of the Azorius Senate, you can advance within the guild. Promotion through the ranks requires the approval of a superior officer. Advancement is a reward for services rendered to the guild, rather than an automatic consequence of increased renown.": "作为阿索里乌斯元老院的成员，通过获得声誉，你可以在行会内晋升。级别的提升需要上级官员的批准。晋升是对为公会提供服务的奖励，而不是名望增加后的自动结果。",

	"Of course, whenever the members of another guild decide to operate within the law, they are potential allies for the Azorius.

Generations of minotaurs of the Ordruun family line have served with honor and distinction, claiming more than fifteen generals to their lineage.": "牛头人以其凶猛的战士和聪明的战略家而闻名。他们肌肉粗壮，心智坚韧，对正义和战场有着强烈的热爱，已经成为波罗斯军团的钢铁脊梁。奥德鲁恩家族的几代牛头人都以荣誉和出色的表现服役，他们的血统里有超过15位将军。",
	"From the perspective of the average Boros soldier, the angels embody the ideals the Boros hold dear. Few mortal soldiers gain admission into the presence of the warleaders and other powerful angels, but battleforce angels fight at the forefront of the legion's ranks, and they form strong friendships with mortals under such life-and-death circumstances. Boros paladins are the members most likely to converse with the angels and be charged with implementing their plans.": "从普通的波罗斯士兵的角度来看，天使体现了波罗斯人所珍视的理想。很少有凡人士兵能够进入战争领袖和其他强大的天使的视线，但战斗部队的天使在军团的最前线作战，他们在这种生死攸关的情况下与凡人结下了深厚的友谊。波洛圣骑士是最有可能与天使交谈并负责执行他们的计划的成员。",
	"The garrison commanders who convey the angels' commands are accessible to the ordinary soldier. In addition to Sunhome, the Boros maintain smaller garrisons throughout the Tenth District, at least one in each of the six precincts.": "传达天使命令的驻军指挥官是普通士兵可以接触到的。除了Sunhome，Boros在整个第十区都有较小的驻军，在六个辖区中至少有一个。",
	"Wherever criminals exploit others, petty tyrants make grabs for power, or violence erupts and leaves devastation in its wake, Boros soldiers are there fighting to make things right.": "无论在哪里，只要有罪犯剥削他人，小暴君争夺权力，或者暴力爆发并留下破坏性的后果，Boros士兵就会在那里战斗，使事情恢复正常。",
	"The Boros Legion is defined by the tension between its goal of establishing order and harmony and the fiery zeal that drives many of its members. The guild stands for peace and justice, which can be established only through the rule of law. Its moral stance is fundamentally good, as it strives to protect the innocent and powerless from oppression and exploitation. At the same time, members of the legion are passionate about their pursuit of justice, spurred by their righteous wrath into action against evil and injustice. Ironically, this means that individual members sometimes break the rules they are charged with enforcing, cleaving to the spirit of the law when the letter no longer serves justice.": "波洛军团是由其建立秩序与和谐的目标与驱动其许多成员的火热热情之间的紧张关系所定义的。该公会代表着和平与正义，只有通过法治才能建立。它的道德立场从根本上说是好的，因为它努力保护无辜和无权的人不受压迫和剥削。同时，军团成员对追求正义充满热情，在他们的正义之怒的刺激下，对邪恶和不公正采取行动。具有讽刺意味的是，这意味着个别成员有时会违反他们负责执行的规则，当法律条文不再有利于正义时，他们会坚持法律的精神。",
	"Because the Guildpact—the one force on Ravnica that can keep the guilds from destroying each other—is now embodied in a single, unreliable person who vanishes for weeks or months at a time, the legion is in a heightened state of vigilance. In this time of uncertainty, the Boros are on constant alert for military threats. They work to maintain their fortifications to ensure that they aren't overrun by Gruul marauders. Construction proceeds on new strongholds near Gruul territories, but in general the Boros prepare for a military threat the same way they always have—by fielding the stronger army.": "因为公会契约--拉夫尼卡上唯一能让公会不互相毁灭的力量--现在体现在一个不可靠的人身上，他每次都会消失几个星期或几个月，所以军团处于高度警惕的状态。在这个不确定的时期，博罗人对军事威胁时刻保持警惕。他们努力维护他们的防御工事，以确保他们不会被格鲁尔掠夺者攻陷。在格鲁尔领地附近的新据点的建设工作也在进行，但总的来说，波罗人准备应对军事威胁的方式与以往一样--派出更强大的军队。",
	"The angels are also bracing for a subtler threat: the danger of infiltration by House Dimir. The Boros are becoming increasingly aware of the possibility that their guild could be undermined from within. Security at garrison buildings is vigilant, with angels watching the entrances at all times for spies.": "天使们也在为一个更微妙的威胁做准备：迪米尔家族的渗透危险。波罗人越来越意识到他们的公会有可能受到内部的破坏。驻军建筑的安保工作非常警觉，天使们随时注意入口处的间谍。",
	"Consider the Boros Legion for your character if one or more of the following sentences ring true:": "如果以下一句或多句话属实，请考虑为你的角色选择波洛军团。",

	"You want to protect the innocent and fight for justice.": "你想保护无辜者，为正义而战。",
	"As a new recruit to the Boros Legion, you were sent to the prestigious Horizon Military Academy for training. Your life there was tempered in the forge of Boros discipline, devotion, and zeal. Your training regimen was deliberately harsh, to weed out the uncommitted. You lasted to the end, and now you begin your adventuring career ready to put everything you have learned to use in the legion's service. Depending on whether you focused on martial training, studied magic, or pursued both courses, your path will look somewhat different.": "作为波罗斯军团的新兵，你被送到著名的地平线军事学院接受训练。你在那里的生活是在博罗军团的纪律、奉献和热情的锻造中得到锤炼的。你的训练计划是刻意严苛的，以淘汰那些不坚定的人。你坚持到了最后，现在你开始了你的冒险生涯，准备将你所学到的一切用于军团的服务中。根据你是专注于武术训练，还是学习魔法，或者同时追求两种课程，你的道路会有些不同。",
	"The bulk of the Boros Legion consists of human, minotaur, and goblin soldiers. If you are a fighter, ranger, or even a barbarian, you'll fit right in among the ranks, with a promising career path ahead of you—promotion through the ranks, with opportunities for special assignments.": "Boros军团的大部分成员由人类、牛头人和地精士兵组成。如果你是一个战士、游侠，甚至是一个野蛮人，你将会很好地融入这个队伍，在你面前有一条很有前途的职业道路--通过等级晋升，有机会获得特殊任务。",
	"Another option is to join the swiftblades, the vanguard of the Boros Legion. They specialize in assault and occupation, and their squads often function as commandos or guerrillas. They pick off enemy archers and mages, softening the enemy's front lines before the rest of the legion marches in.": "另一个选择是加入波洛军团的先锋队--迅捷之刃。他们擅长突击和占领，他们的小队经常扮演突击队或游击队的角色。他们击退敌人的弓箭手和法师，在军团其他成员开进前软化敌人的前线。",
	"If you are spellcaster (perhaps a wizard specialized in the School of Evocation or a cleric of the Light Domain), you can find a place as a combat mage in the Boros Legion, called an embermage. These mages use spells of fire and light to clear the way for the legion's combat troops.": "如果你是施法者（也许是专攻唤灵学派的巫师或光明领域的牧师），你可以在博洛斯军团中找到一个战斗法师的位置，称为栓塞法师。这些法师使用火和光的法术来为军团的战斗部队开路。",
	"If you prefer healing magic over the explosive magic of the embermages (perhaps as a cleric of the Life or the Light Domain), you can become a medic. These combat healers are an essential part of Boros operations, using a combination of magic and mundane medicine to close wounds and restore strength.": "如果你喜欢治疗魔法而不是栓塞法师的爆炸性魔法（也许是作为生命或光明领域的牧师），你可以成为一名医生。这些战斗治疗师是波罗斯行动的重要组成部分，他们使用魔法和世俗药物的组合来关闭伤口和恢复力量。",
	"If you are a paladin who swears the Oath of Devotion, a fighter of the Eldritch Knight archetype, or a cleric of the War Domain, you can combine the martial training of a soldier with magic and call yourself a firefist. Fueled by a healthy dose of righteous zeal, firefists command a great deal of respect in the Boros Legion.": "如果你是一个宣誓献身誓言的圣骑士，一个长生骑士原型的战士，或者一个战争领域的牧师，你可以把士兵的武术训练和魔法结合起来，称自己为火拳。在健康的正义热情的推动下，火拳手在波洛军团中得到了很大的尊重。",
	"The {@background Boros Legionnaire|ggr} background is available for characters who are part of the Boros guild.": "{@background Boros Legionnaire|ggr}的背景对属于波罗斯公会的角色可用。",
	"An adventuring party drawn entirely from the ranks of the Boros Legion would be a small military strike force, probably focused on combat but also strong on social interaction. One or two soldiers (fighters), a medic (cleric), and an embermage (wizard) would form the core of that strike force. A firefist (paladin) would be a strong addition, or might replace a fighter or a cleric. A lightly armored swiftblade (ranger) could help the group in situations involving stealth or exploration.": "一个完全由波罗斯军团成员组成的冒险队伍将是一支小型的军事打击力量，可能侧重于战斗，但也很注重社会互动。一个或两个士兵（战士）、一个医生（牧师）和一个法师（巫师）将构成该突击队的核心。一个火拳手（圣骑士）将是一个强有力的补充，或者可能取代一个战士或一个牧师。一个轻装的快刀手（游侠）可以在涉及隐身或探索的情况下帮助这个团体。",
	"By gaining renown as a member of the Boros Legion, you can ascend through an ordered series of ranks within the guild. Promotion always requires the approval of a superior officer. It is a reward for services rendered to the guild, rather than an automatic consequence of increased renown.": "作为博罗军团的成员，通过获得声誉，你可以在公会内通过一系列有序的等级提升。晋升总是需要得到上级官员的批准。这是对为公会提供的服务的奖励，而不是声望提高后的自动结果。",
	"In addition, certain positions become available to you when both your renown and your character level reach certain thresholds.": "此外，当你的声望和你的角色等级达到一定的阈值时，某些职位就可以为你所用。",
	"At this rank, you gain some authority over lower-ranking soldiers. When you undertake a mission on the guild's behalf that requires military strength, a squad of {@dice 1d4} {@creature Soldier|GGR|soldiers} accompanies and assists you for the duration of the mission.": "在这个等级，你获得了对低级士兵的一些权力。当你代表公会承担一项需要军事力量的任务时，一个由{@dice 1d4}{@creature Soldier|GGR|soldiers}组成的小队会在任务期间陪伴和协助你。",
	"Your salary at this rank is enough to maintain a modest lifestyle, including private quarters in the garrison.": "你在这个级别的工资足以维持一个适度的生活方式，包括在驻军中的私人宿舍。",
	"If you meet the prerequisites, you can apply to join the elite soldiers of the Wojek League. This special order serves as a combination of military police and military intelligence, giving it a fair degree of independence within the guild. Its members scout the activities of other guilds to assess their military strength and predict potential threats, and they sometimes activate squads to defuse threats before they grow more serious. The Wojeks also help the angels root out spies and leaks within the legion. Secondarily, the Wojek League is responsible for policing the ranks of the legion. When members get carried away by their zeal and break the law or abuse their authority, the Wojeks take on the tasks of investigating, apprehending, and punishing the malefactors. Similarly, if members of the legion disappear (involuntarily or otherwise), Wojek agents are typically the ones called to investigate.": "如果你符合先决条件，你可以申请加入沃杰克联盟的精英士兵。这个特殊的命令作为军事警察和军事情报的组合，使其在公会内部具有相当程度的独立性。它的成员侦察其他公会的活动，以评估他们的军事力量并预测潜在的威胁，他们有时会启动小队，在威胁变得更严重之前化解它们。Wojeks还帮助天使们铲除军团内部的间谍和泄密者。其次，Wojek联盟负责监督军团的队伍。当成员被他们的热情冲昏头脑，违反法律或滥用他们的权力时，Wojeks就会承担起调查、逮捕和惩罚犯罪者的任务。同样地，如果军团成员失踪（非自愿或其他原因），Wojek探员通常会被要求进行调查。",
	"You can be both a skyknight and a member of the Wojek League, gaining the title of Skyjek.": "你可以既是天衣无缝的人，又是沃杰克联盟的成员，获得天衣无缝的称号。",
	"As a brigadier, you are responsible for missions and strategies that you can't execute entirely on your own or with the aid of a handful of soldiers. After receiving goals handed down from the captain above you, it's your job to figure out the tactics needed to accomplish those goals.": "作为一名旅长，你负责的任务和战略不能完全由你自己或在少数士兵的帮助下执行。在收到你上面的队长下达的目标后，你的工作是找出完成这些目标所需的战术。",
	"At this rank, you gain a {@reward Boros charm|ggr} (described in {@book chapter 5|GGR|5}) at the start of each mission you undertake on the guild's behalf. You continue to receive a salary sufficient to maintain a modest lifestyle, but your quarters in the garrison are more spacious.": "在这个等级，你在代表公会承担的每项任务开始时都会获得{@reward Boros charm|ggr}（在{@book chapter 5|GGR|5}中描述）。你继续获得足以维持适度生活的薪水，但你在驻军中的宿舍更加宽敞。",
	"Members of the Sunhome Guard are responsible for the defense of Sunhome, the Boros guildhall in the Tenth District. Only those who have proven themselves in combat are selected to join this force. If you are accepted into the Sunhome Guard, your missions will be primarily defensive in nature. You might receive orders to find new ways to fortify the guildhall or to detect Dimir agents and other spies who try to gain access. Of course, given these chaotic times, you could end up defending Sunhome from an all-out attack by the Gruul or some other enemy force.": "太阳之家守卫队的成员负责保卫太阳之家，即第十区的Boros公会大厦。只有那些在战斗中证明自己的人被选入这支部队。如果你被接受加入太阳城卫队，你的任务将主要是防御性的。你可能会收到命令，寻找新的方法来加固公会大厦，或检测迪米尔特工和其他试图进入的间谍。当然，考虑到这个混乱的时代，你最终可能会在格鲁尔或其他敌人的全面进攻中保卫太阳城。",
	"As a captain in the Boros Legion, you gain command of a small garrison and the responsibility for maintaining order and protecting people in part of a city district. You have four brigades under your command. As described for rank 3, each brigade has six squads of five soldiers (including a sergeant) reporting to them. One additional squad of {@dice 2d4} soldiers is your personal retinue.": "作为波罗斯军团的队长，你获得了一个小型驻军的指挥权，并负责维持秩序和保护部分城市地区的人民。你有四个大队在你的指挥下。如同3级的描述，每个大队有6个5人的小队（包括一个中士）向他们报告。另有一个由{@dice 2d4}士兵组成的小队是你的私人随从。",
	"You regularly receive communications from warleader angels who coordinate the efforts of the smaller garrisons.

	"You continue to draw a salary sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.": "你继续领取足以维持舒适生活的工资。",
	"In general, the Boros find some common ground with other guilds that value order and structure: Azorius, Selensya, and (to a lesser extent) Orzhov. The {@creature Rakdos|GGR}, Gruul, and Izzet might share the zeal and energy of the Boros, but they represent the more chaotic aspect of those qualities, which threatens the stability of all Ravnica.": "一般来说，博罗人与其他重视秩序和结构的公会有一些共同点。阿佐里乌斯（Azorius）、塞伦西亚（Selensya）和（在较小程度上）奥尔佐夫。{@creature Rakdos|GGR}、格鲁尔和伊泽特可能会分享博罗的热情和能量，但他们代表了这些品质中更混乱的一面，这威胁着整个拉夫尼卡的稳定。",
	"The legion is dedicated to combating the influence of Dimir spies and infiltrators, containing the brutal chaos of the {@creature Rakdos|GGR}, and halting the schemes of the Golgari. But any guild can become an enemy of Boros if its aims and activities lead to crime, chaos, injustice, or harm to the innocent citizens of Ravnica. Even the Azorius can become so obsessive in creating and enforcing laws that they overreach the bounds of justice.": "该军团致力于打击迪米尔间谍和渗透者的影响，遏制{@creature Rakdos|GGR}的残酷混乱，并阻止戈尔加里的计划。但是，如果任何公会的目标和活动导致犯罪、混乱、不公正或对拉夫尼卡的无辜公民造成伤害，那么它就会成为博洛斯的敌人。即使是阿佐里乌斯（Azorius）也会在制定和执行法律时变得如此执着，以至于超越了正义的界限。",
	"Conversely, any guild can offer you allies in your quest for justice. Distasteful as they might be, even the Gruul and the {@creature Rakdos|GGR} can play a part in curtailing threats to the city that also impede their own interests.": "反过来说，任何公会都可以在你寻求正义的过程中为你提供盟友。尽管他们可能令人厌恶，但即使是格鲁尔和{@creature Rakdos|GGR}也能在减少对城市的威胁方面发挥一定的作用，这些威胁也阻碍了他们自己的利益。",
	"The Boros are committed to justice and order, and they are convinced that virtually every other guild is just as committed to undermining both. Therefore, the Boros rely only on their comrades for support and view everyone else with suspicion or disdain.": "波罗人致力于正义和秩序，他们相信几乎所有其他公会都同样致力于破坏这两者。因此，博罗人只依靠他们的战友来支持，对其他所有人都持怀疑或不屑的态度。",

Secrecy is both House Dimir's best weapon and its best defense, and much of the guild's work is hidden even from other members. Dimir agents leave no trace of their covert activities, warping the memories of witnesses to their crimes and even wiping their own minds to remove any evidence of their completed assignments.": "迪米尔家族是拉夫尼卡的黑暗秘密：在受人尊敬的信使和记者的外表下，潜藏着一个由间谍和刺客组成的协会，其存在几乎不被广大民众所怀疑。秘密既是迪米尔家族最好的武器，也是最好的防御，公会的许多工作甚至对其他成员都是隐藏的。迪米尔的特工们不留下任何秘密活动的痕迹，他们扭曲目击者的记忆，甚至抹去自己的思想，以消除任何有关他们完成任务的证据。",
	"The first guildmaster of House Dimir was a vampire named Szadek, whose organization agreed to serve as Ravnica's couriers, information brokers, and librarians. But Szadek also used his guild's expertise at gathering information to build a vast spy network, and before long, the secret operations of the guild vastly outweighed its overt ones. Eventually the guild disappeared into the shadows, and most Ravnicans came to doubt its existence.

One agent knows another only by a code name, or receives communications only at a particular meeting spot at a specific place and time. Every self-proclaimed expert with an opinion on the matter has a theory about the guild's intentions, and all those guesses about Dimir's motivations and pursuits contradict each other, frustrating any attempt to get to the truth of things.

	"To House Dimir, knowledge is power. The guild hungers to learn everything it doesn't already know, especially the weaknesses of its adversaries, and to exploit those weaknesses for its own gain.

	"House Dimir's progress toward its goals depends on a web woven from meticulously gathered intelligence. Unpredictable behavior by other guilds can destabilize that web. When the Boros take sudden, forceful action inspired by an unexpected burst of zeal, the Dimir can be caught off guard. The Selesnya behave predictably on the whole, but the members of the conclave are so numerous that it can be hard for the Dimir to keep track of their activities. Of all the other guilds, the Izzet and the Gruul concern the Dimir the most; their erratic methods of decision-making, combined with their unflinching approach to danger, can quickly undermine any Dimir strategy designed to contain them.": "迪米尔家族实现其目标的进展取决于一个由精心收集的情报编织而成的网络。其他行会不可预测的行为会破坏这个网络的稳定。当博罗人在突如其来的热情激励下采取突然、有力的行动时，迪米尔人可能会措手不及。塞勒斯尼亚人的行为总体上可以预测，但其成员人数众多，迪米尔人很难跟踪他们的活动。在所有其他行会中，伊泽特人和格鲁尔人最让迪米尔人担心；他们反复无常的决策方法，再加上他们对危险毫不留情的态度，可以迅速破坏任何旨在遏制他们的迪米尔战略。",

Perhaps most important, according to the philosophy of House Dimir, higher standing brings greater knowledge of the inner workings of Ravnica and the guild.": "当你在迪米尔家族中获得声望时，你会得到越来越重要的任务奖励。没有正式的等级供你晋升，但某些声望的门槛表明你在公会中的地位有所提高。也许最重要的是，根据迪米尔家族的理念，更高的地位会带来更多关于拉夫尼卡和公会内部运作的知识。",

	"As an independent agent, you have considerable latitude in the way you choose to implement your mission goals.": "作为一个独立的代理商，你在选择执行任务目标的方式上有很大的自由度。",
	"You acquire a {@item Spies' Murmur|GGR|spies' murmur} (described in {@book chapter 5|GGR|5})—a magic device that allows you to communicate telepathically with other Dimir agents who wear similar items. If this item is lost or destroyed, it's up to you to secure a replacement.": "你获得了一个{@item Spies' Murmur|GGR|spies' murmur}（在{@book chapter 5|GGR|5}中描述）--一个魔法装置，可以让你与其他佩戴类似物品的迪米尔特工进行心灵感应。如果这个物品丢失或被毁，你要自己去找一个替代品。",
	"By the time you reach this level of renown in House Dimir, you are amassing a significant collection of secrets about the people and places around you. You know the location of a hidden safe house where you can take shelter in case of dire need. At the DM's discretion, you might also know (or be able to find out) a secret about a person or group who lives or operates in a neighborhood you're familiar with. The secret is typically a person's flaw or details about a dark episode in a group's past. Whatever it is, the secret is a weakness that can be used to manipulate the person or group to assist you or your associates.": "当你在迪米尔家族的名声达到这个水平时，你已经积累了大量关于你周围的人和地方的秘密。你知道一个隐蔽的安全屋的位置，在有迫切需要的情况下你可以在那里避难。根据DM的判断，你也可能知道（或能够发现）一个关于在你熟悉的街区居住或活动的人或团体的秘密。这个秘密通常是一个人的缺陷或一个团体过去的黑暗事件的细节。不管是什么，这个秘密是一个弱点，可以用来操纵这个人或团体来帮助你或你的同伙。",
	"At this level of renown, you are responsible for coordinating the activities of several other Dimir agents. You still receive orders from the usual source, but you're given broad goals and wide latitude in how to carry them out, including delegating specific tasks to other Dimir agents of lesser renown. You are also increasingly trusted with important secrets.": "在这个级别的名声，你负责协调其他几个迪米尔特工的活动。你仍然从通常的来源接受命令，但你被赋予广泛的目标和如何执行的广泛自由度，包括将具体任务委托给其他名气较小的迪米尔特工。你也越来越被信任为重要的秘密。",
	"It's hard for a guild built on stealth and secrecy to maintain a positive relationship with any other guild. All guilds are monitored with suspicion, and they assessed for their current and prospective levels of threat, as well as for their usefulness to House Dimir's schemes. Each cell may foster its own relationships with the other guilds, but it ultimately defers to Dimir's enigmatic leaders to steer overarching strategy.": "一个建立在隐秘和保密基础上的行会很难与其他行会保持积极的关系。所有的行会都被怀疑地监视着，他们被评估为当前和未来的威胁程度，以及对迪米尔家族的计划是否有用。每个小组都可以与其他公会建立自己的关系，但最终还是要听从迪米尔的神秘领导人来指导总体战略。",
	"Your missions might put you at odds with any other guild by calling on you to infiltrate that guild and gain insight into its plans, steal proprietary information from its guildhall, or subvert its leadership. For instance, you could be tasked to steal the transcript of an Azorius interrogation, the memories of Golgari spy, or the contents of an Orzhov ledger.": "你的任务可能会让你与其他公会产生矛盾，要求你潜入该公会并深入了解其计划，从其公会大厅偷取专有信息，或颠覆其领导层。例如，你的任务可能是偷取阿佐里乌斯的审讯记录，戈尔加里间谍的记忆，或者奥卓夫账簿的内容。",
	"You might cooperate with members of other guilds, openly or in disguise, insofar as their goals don't conflict with yours.

	"A small crowd of pale elves and humans stepped into the light. Bits of bone and detritus woven into their matted hair clicked lightly. Their chitinous armor swarmed with tiny, riotous insects that moved in and out of the sheen of moss growing on their shoulders—a bed for sprouting fungi. Whether it was the Golgari themselves who had made the chittering sound or their bugs, Ral could not be sure.": "一小群脸色苍白的精灵和人类步入了光明。骨头和碎屑的碎片交织在他们枯黄的头发上，发出轻轻的咔嚓声。他们的壳质盔甲上涌动着细小而骚动的昆虫，这些昆虫在他们肩上生长的苔藓的光泽中进进出出--那是发芽的真菌的床。到底是戈尔加里人自己发出了颤抖的声音，还是他们的虫子，拉尔无法确定。",
	"The teeming masses that compose the Golgari Swarm see themselves as pragmatic above all else, uncowed by the simple fact that death is part of the cycle of life. They believe the idea of life and death as opposing forces to be nothing more than naive sentimentality. They know everything crumbles and rots in the end, and then new life springs from that rot. Time inevitably passes, bringing both destruction and new creation to all things.": "组成Golgari Swarm的芸芸众生认为自己是最务实的，不畏惧死亡是生命循环的一部分这一简单事实。他们认为生与死对立的想法不过是天真的感伤。他们知道所有的东西最后都会崩溃和腐烂，然后新的生命从这种腐烂中涌现。时间不可避免地流逝，给万物带来毁灭和新的创造。",
	"The original mandate of the Golgari Swarm under the leadership of Svogthir, its Devkarin founder, was to maintain Ravnica's agriculture and manage its waste. But Svogthir's interest in necromancy, and his eventual transformation into a lich, shaped the course of the guild's activities and gave birth to its philosophy of embracing death as part of nature's cycle.": "Golgari Swarm在其Devkarin创始人Svogthir的领导下，最初的任务是维护Ravnica的农业和管理其废物。但斯沃格蒂尔对死灵法术的兴趣，以及他最终变成了一个巫妖，决定了公会的活动方向，并诞生了其拥抱死亡作为自然循环的一部分的哲学。",
	"The three most important power groups within the Golgari are the Devkarin elves, the medusas (also called gorgons in Ravnica), and the insectile kraul. Jarad is an undead representative of the Devkarin, so the elves claim a privileged position within the guild for the moment.": "戈尔加里内部最重要的三个势力集团是德夫卡林精灵、梅杜萨人（在拉夫尼卡也叫戈尔贡）和昆虫人克劳尔。贾拉德是德夫卡林的亡灵代表，所以精灵们暂时在行会中拥有特权地位。",
	"Members of the Golgari Swarm live in the shadow of Jarad and the leaders of the individual factions. The machinations among elves, medusas, kraul, and other creatures rarely bring any significant improvement to the lives of the swarm's countless members, but often cause disruption and occasionally disaster. Most guild members believe it's best to keep their heads down and stay out of the political conflict and to avoid attracting the disfavor of the Ochran, the guild's order of assassins. More adventurous members might enjoy intrigue and politics, or might unwittingly become tangled up in the schemes of the guild's leaders.": "Golgari蜂群的成员生活在Jarad和各个派别的领导者的阴影下。精灵、梅杜莎、克劳尔和其他生物之间的阴谋诡计很少给蜂群无数成员的生活带来任何显著的改善，但经常会造成混乱，偶尔会造成灾难。大多数行会成员认为最好是低调行事，不参与政治冲突，避免引起行会的刺客组织Ochran的不满。更有冒险精神的成员可能喜欢阴谋和政治，或者可能在不知不觉中被公会领导人的阴谋所纠缠。",
	"Jarad maintains a council of shamans and rogues to serve as a combination of advisory parliament and spy agency. These high chancellors rarely convene publicly, preferring to disperse themselves throughout the swarm to keep information flowing from the nucleus to every part of the organism.": "贾拉德维持着一个由巫师和流氓组成的理事会，作为咨询议会和间谍机构的组合。这些大法官们很少公开召开会议，他们更愿意将自己分散在整个蜂群中，以保持信息从核心到有机体的每个部分的流动。",
	"The Golgari Swarm celebrates the growth and vibrancy of the natural world, but gives equal attention to nature's facets of destruction, decay, and death. It finds allies and agents in the form of fungi, oozes, insects, diseases, and other unsavory aspects of nature, and it uses the power of nature actively toward the goal of advancing its own place in the world. But the Golgari have also learned patience from nature; they are content to work from the shadows, harnessing the energy that comes from decay while the civilization of Ravnica slowly erodes and destroys itself.": "Golgari Swarm赞美自然界的成长和活力，但对自然界的破坏、衰败和死亡方面也给予同样的关注。它以真菌、渗出物、昆虫、疾病以及自然界其他不愉快的方面的形式找到盟友和代理人，并积极利用自然界的力量，以推进自己在世界中的地位。但戈尔加里人也从自然中学到了耐心；他们满足于从阴影中工作，在拉夫尼卡的文明慢慢侵蚀和毁灭自己时，利用来自腐烂的能量。",
	"The teeming hordes of the Golgari Swarm believe it is finally their time to shine. They have dwelled under the streets and under the sway of the other guilds for too long. They are convinced that Ravnica's institutions are now on the verge of collapse and that the absence of the Living Guildpact proves it. However, the Golgari are neither surprised nor panicked by this, for they believe that all things eventually rot and die, and from this decay, new life blooms. As such, the Golgari see the looming interguild conflict as a necessary final push to bring about a new era—their era.": "Golgari Swarm的成群结队的人相信，现在终于是他们大显身手的时候了。他们已经在街头巷尾和其他公会的摇摆下生活了太久。他们确信拉夫尼卡的机构现在正处于崩溃的边缘，而活人公会的缺席证明了这一点。然而，戈尔加里人对此既不惊讶也不惊慌，因为他们相信所有的东西最终都会腐烂和死亡，而从这种腐烂中，新的生命会绽放。因此，戈尔加里人将迫在眉睫的公会间冲突视为带来新时代的必要的最后推动力--他们的时代。",
	"The Golgari are preparing for upheaval. They have sealed many of the passages leading into the undercity, making their territory seem like an impregnable subterranean fortress. Within it, the Golgari domain retains its grandeur, a mysterious and wondrous kingdom. The rare visitors who stumble into it are awed by its beauty and its aura of ancient power. Palatial architecture fills cavernous sewer chambers, and luminescent spores float through the air to shed an otherworldly light on the moss-covered masonry. Entering Golgari territory feels like stepping into a secret world of dangerous beauty.": "戈尔加里人正在为动乱做准备。他们已经封住了许多通往地下城市的通道，使他们的领地看起来像一个坚不可摧的地下堡垒。在这里面，戈尔加里人的领地保持着它的宏伟，是一个神秘而奇妙的王国。偶然进入这里的稀少访客被它的美丽和古老力量的光环所震撼。宫殿式的建筑充斥着空旷的下水道室，发光的孢子漂浮在空气中，在覆盖着青苔的砖石上洒下异样的光芒。进入戈尔加里的领地感觉就像踏入了一个危险的美丽的秘密世界。",
	"Also called the elves of shadow, the Devkarin are one of the three branches of Ravnica's elf race. Like other elves, the Devkarin are adept spellcasters, counting most of the Golgari's shamans among their number.": "Devkarin也被称为阴影精灵，是拉夫尼卡精灵种族的三个分支之一。和其他精灵一样，德夫卡林也是善于施法的人，他们中的大多数是戈尔加里的巫师。",
	"After being cast out of the nascent Selesnya Conclave millennia ago, the Devkarin found a home amid the corrupted and overgrown places of Ravnica, and the Devkarin necromancer Svogthir became the founder of the Golgari Swarm. Since then, the Devkarin have been a major influence in the guild, even during the times when they didn't hold absolute power. Regardless of who rules the guild, the Devkarin follow the guidance of a high priest, called the matka. The matka's spiritual leadership usually aligns with the guildmaster's temporal commands, but during times when the guild is ruled by a non-elf faction, the matka can be a significant dissenting voice.": "在千年前被赶出新生的塞勒斯尼亚协约国后，德夫卡林在拉夫尼卡的腐败和杂草丛生的地方找到了一个家，德夫卡林的死灵法师斯沃格蒂尔成为了戈尔加里群的创始人。从那时起，德夫卡林一直是公会的主要影响者，即使在他们没有掌握绝对权力的时候。无论谁统治公会，Devkarin都会遵循一个被称为matka的大祭司的指导。Matka的精神领导通常与公会会长的时间命令相一致，但在公会被非精灵派系统治的时候，Matka可以成为一个重要的反对声音。",

	"You like elves and druids but want to explore an unusual direction.": "你喜欢精灵和德鲁伊，但想探索一个不寻常的方向。",
	"If you aren't adept at magic, the swarm still needs you. Golgari warriors both defend the guild's territory and, when necessary, take offensive action. If you are a fighter (typically of the Champion archetype), you can serve as a shock trooper, perhaps fighting alongside kraul and trolls on behalf of the swarm. If you are a ranger (likely of the Beast Master archetype) or a rogue (of the Thief or Assassin archetype), you are more of a skirmisher. Golgari rangers favor insects and reptiles as companions.": "如果你不擅长魔法，虫群仍然需要你。戈尔加里战士既要保卫公会的领地，必要时又要采取进攻行动。如果你是一个战士（通常是冠军原型），你可以作为一个突击队员，也许会代表虫群与克劳尔和巨魔并肩作战。如果你是游侠（可能是野兽大师原型）或流氓（盗贼或刺客原型），你更像是一个小兵。戈尔加里游侠喜欢昆虫和爬行动物作为同伴。",

	"Every member of the Golgari Swarm has its place, and every role is important to the proper functioning of the guild. Aside from a few leadership positions, the swarm doesn't consider different functions to be more or less important than others. The idea of progressing up the ranks is foreign to the Golgari way of thinking. That said, your renown within the Golgari is a direct measure of the guildmaster's knowledge of you, his confidence in your abilities, and his interest in your activities.": "Golgari Swarm的每个成员都有自己的位置，每个角色对公会的正常运作都很重要。除了一些领导职位外，蜂群并不认为不同的职能比其他职能更重要或更不重要。向上爬的想法对戈尔加里人的思维方式是陌生的。也就是说，你在戈尔加里内部的声望是衡量会长对你的了解、对你能力的信心以及对你活动的兴趣的直接标准。",
	"You have distinguished yourself from the mass of your peers.

	"The Golgari prefer to erode their enemies' strength through a process of attrition rather than by launching frontal attacks. If you are called on to take direct action against another guild, it is probably a matter of self-preservation against a guild that is threatening the life and livelihood of the Golgari.

Occasionally, you might be assigned to assault the enemies of the Golgari more directly, especially if you are a member of the Ochran. If the death of a particular person or the theft of a key treasure will contribute to the decline and downfall of an enemy guild, even the typically patient Golgari will try to seize that opportunity.": "戈尔加里人更喜欢通过消耗的过程来削弱敌人的实力，而不是通过发动正面攻击。如果你被要求对另一个公会采取直接行动，那可能是为了自我保护，对抗一个威胁到戈尔加里人的生命和生计的公会。你可能会反对阿佐里乌斯（Azorius）试图将他们的管辖范围扩大到城下，或者反击波洛（Boros），以劝阻他们向戈尔加里的领土发动更多的攻击。偶尔，你可能会被指派去更直接地攻击戈尔加里人的敌人，特别是如果你是奥克兰的成员。如果某个人的死亡或某个关键宝物的失窃将有助于敌方公会的衰落和垮台，即使是典型的有耐心的戈尔加里人也会努力抓住这个机会。",
	"You might ally with members of another guild if they are working—even unwittingly—toward goals you share. The Gruul, for example, are adept at hastening the decay of both humanoid populations and physical structures, even if they remain unaware of their full role in the natural cycle. If some event threatens to upset the balance of nature, such as a necromantic blight that kills all growth or a magical wildfire rampaging through the city, you might join other nature-oriented guilds in an attempt to curtail it and preserve the balance.": "如果另一个行会的成员正在为你们共同的目标而努力--即使是在不知情的情况下--你们可能会与之结盟。例如，格鲁尔（Gruul）善于加速人形生物和物理结构的腐烂，即使他们仍然没有意识到自己在自然循环中的全部作用。如果某些事件有可能破坏自然界的平衡，例如杀死所有生长的死灵病，或者在城市中肆虐的魔法野火，你可能会加入其他以自然为导向的行会，试图遏制它并保持平衡。",

Their skin was alive with tattoos, etched with a combination of magic, ink, and, Jace supposed, a considerable amount of pain. Each of them was a hulk of muscle, and Ruric Thar was the largest and mightiest of them all.": "杰斯从来没有见过，也没有闻过，格鲁尔战队的味道。他们的盔甲是用兽皮和骨头制成的，他们的武器是捡来的城市垃圾的重物。他们的皮肤上有很多纹身，是由魔法、墨水和杰斯认为的相当多的痛苦组合而成的。他们每个人都是肌肉发达的大块头，而鲁里克-塔尔是他们中最大、最强壮的一个。",
	"The Gruul Clans are a wild people in a civilized land, a loose affiliation of bands that squat on the fringes of Ravnican society. They shun the centers of civilization, which they see as a source of oppression and weakness, and instead haunt Ravnica's alleyways, abandoned zones, and ruins. They want to see the edifice of civilization torn down so the world can revert to the pure wilderness that thrived before the city grew to cover everything. Then the true order of nature can be restored—an unbridled and brutal state in which only the strong survive and the strongest rule.": "格鲁尔氏族是文明土地上的野蛮人，他们是蹲在拉夫尼卡社会边缘的一个松散联盟。他们避开文明中心，认为那是压迫和软弱的源头，而在拉夫尼卡的小巷、废弃区和废墟中出没。他们希望看到文明的大厦被拆毁，这样世界就能恢复到城市发展到覆盖一切之前的纯洁的荒野，从而繁荣起来。然后自然界的真正秩序可以被恢复--一个不受约束的、残酷的状态，其中只有强者生存，最强者统治。",
	"In a world covered with city streets and towering buildings, the Gruul are the most out of place, the most ill at ease, and the most eager to topple it all and start fresh. Constant ritualistic warfare reverberates among the clans, every skirmish reinforcing their doctrine of the survival of the fittest. They frequently send sorties into civilized areas to secure goods—and to wreak havoc.": "在一个布满城市街道和高楼大厦的世界里，格鲁尔人是最不合群的，最不自在的，也是最渴望推翻这一切，重新开始的。不断的仪式性战争在部族中回荡，每一次小规模的战争都会加强他们适者生存的理论。他们经常派遣突击队进入文明地区，以确保货物和破坏。",
	"The first leader of the Gruul was Cisarzim, a cyclops who was purportedly the ancestor of {@creature Borborygmos|GGR}, the current guildmaster. Cisarzim was called the Lord of Chaos, and his guild's original function as maintainers of Ravnica's natural places meant keeping his faction as remote as possible from the civilized parts of the world. The gradual expansion of the city, however, has driven the Gruul into smaller and smaller refuges.": "格鲁尔的第一任领导人是Cisarzim，一个独眼巨人，据说是现任公会会长{@creature Borborygmos|GGR}的祖先。Cisarzim被称为混沌之主，他的公会最初的职能是维护拉夫尼卡的自然场所，这意味着让他的派别尽可能远离世界的文明部分。然而，城市的逐渐扩张将格鲁尔人赶到越来越小的避难所。",
	"Gruul goblins live in colonies scattered at the edges of Gruul territory and civilized neighborhoods. They fight fiercely when threatened, punctuating their attacks with hisses and growls. When battle fury takes hold of a Gruul raiding group, it typically starts with the goblins, and after the battle, the surviving goblins are still frothing at the mouth and looking for someone to hit.": "格鲁尔妖精生活在散落在格鲁尔领土和文明社区边缘的殖民地。当受到威胁时，它们会激烈地战斗，用嘶嘶声和咆哮声来标明它们的攻击。当战火烧到格鲁尔人的突击队时，通常是从地精开始的，战斗结束后，幸存的地精仍然口吐白沫，寻找可以攻击的对象。",
	"{@b Burning Tree Clan}. The Burning Tree clan is the most fearsome of the Gruul Clans, as well as the largest and most diverse, with branches in several districts of Ravnica. The fear and awe inspired by {@creature Borborygmos|GGR} unifies its diverse membership. The Ravnican populace regards the symbol of the Burning Tree clan as the symbol for the entire Gruul guild.": "{@b Burning Tree Clan}. 燃烧之树部族是格鲁尔部族中最可怕的，也是最大和最多样化的，在拉夫尼卡的几个地区都有分支。由(1%)激发的恐惧和敬畏将其不同的成员团结起来。拉夫尼卡的民众将燃烧之树部族的象征视为整个格鲁尔公会的象征。",
	"{@b Ghor Clan}. The Ghor clan is led by an ettin named Ruric Thar (or, perhaps more properly, Ruric and Thar, since the heads claim separate names). Of all the clans, the Ghor carry out the most frequent and savage assaults on Ravnica's citizenry. The clan is known for its audacity in forging encampments close to heavily populated districts.": "{@b Ghor Clan}. 戈尔部族由一个名叫鲁里克-塔尔（Ruric Thar）的人领导（或者，也许更正确的说法是鲁里克和塔尔，因为他们的首领都声称有独立的名字）。在所有的部族中，戈尔部族对拉夫尼卡的公民进行了最频繁和野蛮的攻击。该部族因其在人口稠密地区附近建立营地的大胆行为而闻名。",
	"{@b Scab Clan}. Members of the Scab clan display scars and body modifications, which they view as expressions of the powerful rage they harbor within themselves. The clan has grown in influence by engulfing or destroying several smaller clans in recent years, but the leader of the Scabs, a corpulent giant known as Narbulg Nine Fingers, has not gone so far as to challenge the Burning Tree clan.": "{@b Scab Clan}. 斯卡布氏族的成员显示出疤痕和身体的修饰，他们认为这是他们内心强大的愤怒的表现。近年来，该部族通过吞并或摧毁几个较小的部族，其影响力不断扩大，但疥疮部族的领袖，一个被称为Narbulg Nine Fingers的肥胖巨人，还没有走到挑战燃烧之树部族的地步。",
	"{@b Slizt Clan}. The Slizt clan is a clutch of sly, skittish warriors, consisting largely of reptilian humanoids called viashino (use the {@creature lizardfolk} stat block in the {@book Monster Manual|MM} to represent them), along with a few wily humans. This clan survives in the rubblebelts by taking up hiding places in high ground and ambushing its enemies with ranged attacks from above. Other Gruul regard the Slizt as skulkers and cowards, but nonetheless all are cautious when entering areas with elevated ruins. The home ground of the Slizt clan is the Husk, an area at the center of a vast rubblebelt featuring many large, ancient structures that have remained standing for generations.": "{@b Slizt Clan}. 斯里兹特氏族是一群狡猾、胆小的战士，主要由被称为viashino的爬行动物组成（使用{@creature lizardfolk}状态块中的{@book Monster Manual|MM}来代表他们），同时还有一些狡猾的人类。这个部族在瓦砾地带的生存方式是躲藏在高处，从高处伏击敌人，进行远程攻击。其他格鲁尔人认为斯里兹特人是躲藏者和懦夫，但尽管如此，当进入有高处废墟的地区时，所有人都会小心翼翼。斯里兹特氏族的主场是哈斯克（Husk），这是一个位于巨大的废墟地带中心的区域，有许多大型的、古老的建筑，已经保持了好几代。",
	"{@b Gravel Hide Clan}. The Gravel Hide clan believes that resilience is the truest measure of strength. Though a relatively new group, its members have already earned a reputation (almost certainly exaggerated) for shrugging off devastating attacks. The clan's leader, a hot-tempered goblin named Skorik Boulder Tooth, adorns himself with the shattered remnants of weapons that he has rent to bits with his own jaws.": "{@b Gravel Hide Clan}. 砾石隐蔽部族相信，复原力是衡量实力的最真实标准。虽然是一个相对较新的团体，但其成员已经赢得了甩掉毁灭性攻击的声誉（几乎肯定是夸张的）。该部族的首领是一个脾气暴躁的地精，名叫斯科里克-大石牙，他用自己的下颚将武器撕成碎片的残骸来装饰自己。",
	"{@b Zhur-Taa Clan}. The Zhur-Taa clan advocates an extreme interpretation of the Old Ways. Central to this view is its belief in the imminent awakening of an ancient boar god—Ilharg, the Raze-Boar—who will lay waste to the overcivilized world. Led by a centaur druid called Nikya of the Old Ways, the Zhur-Taa pile up skulls as offerings to this god, and their druids perform guttural chants before and during battle that are said to be in the language of the old gods.": "{@b Zhur-Taa Clan}. Zhur-Taa氏族主张对古老的方法进行极端的解释。这种观点的核心是相信一个古老的野猪神--伊尔哈格（Ilharg）--雷泽-野猪--即将苏醒，他将毁灭这个过度文明的世界。在一个被称为 \"古老方式 \"的半人马德鲁伊的领导下，Zhur-Taa将头骨堆积起来作为对该神的祭品，他们的德鲁伊在战斗前和战斗中都会吟唱一些据说是古老神灵的语言。",
	"Zhur-Taa druids are adept at summoning and training beasts as war-companions and mounts, and the clan's warriors wade into battle alongside giant boars, other beasts, and even wurms or hydras.": "Zhur-Taa德鲁伊善于召唤和训练野兽作为战友和坐骑，该部族的战士们与巨野猪、其他野兽、甚至狼人或水蛇一起涉足战斗。",
	"{@b Bolrac Clan}. The most selective of all the Gruul Clans, the Bolrac clan denies membership to the smaller races. Its members are all enormous, lumbering brutes, primarily cyclopes, ogres, and giants. The clan's leadership changes frequently—sometimes daily, since battles for supremacy are as common as meals. The Bolrac clan specializes in bringing down massive structures using mauls and battering rams. The only thing the Bolrac love more than destroying something smaller than them is toppling, overrunning, and destroying something larger than them.": "{@b Bolrac Clan}. 在所有格鲁尔部族中，博拉克部族是最有选择性的，它拒绝小种族加入。它的成员都是巨大的、笨重的野蛮人，主要是独眼巨人、食人魔和巨人。该部族的领导层经常更换，有时是每天更换，因为争夺最高地位的战斗就像吃饭一样常见。博拉克氏族擅长使用大锤和撞锤推倒大型建筑。比起摧毁比他们小的东西，博拉克人唯一喜欢的是推翻、碾压和摧毁比他们大的东西。",
	"{@b Trogs}. Some wandering hermits, known as trogs, find even the company of a clan to be too suffocating, so they spend their days alone in the wild places of Ravnica. These individuals are fierce, independent warriors who traverse the rubblebelts as apex predators. Trogs are notoriously short-tempered and impatient around others. Occasionally, they heed the call of the guildmaster to join in riots or festivals, but more often they conduct their own ceremonies and celebrations in private.": "{@b Trogs}. 一些流浪的隐士，被称为 \"trogs\"，他们发现即使有氏族的陪伴也太令人窒息了，所以他们在拉夫尼卡的野外独自度过了他们的日子。这些人是凶猛的、独立的战士，他们作为顶级掠夺者在瓦砾带中穿行。特罗格人是出了名的脾气暴躁，在别人面前不耐烦。偶尔，他们会听从公会会长的号召，参加暴乱或节日活动，但更多的时候，他们会在私下进行自己的仪式和庆祝活动。",
	"So far as any philosophy can be said to underlie the Gruul way of life, it is about living in the now, with little concern for forethought, planning, or speculation. Impulse drives the actions of the Gruul Clans. They want to live their lives unimpeded, and they lash out when something tries to stand in their way. Emotion and impulsiveness drive them as they seek to do what they want, take what they want, and smash what they want.": "就格鲁尔人的生活方式所依据的任何哲学而言，它是关于活在当下，很少考虑到预想、计划或猜测。冲动是格鲁尔部族行动的动力。他们希望自己的生活不受阻碍，当有东西试图阻挡他们时，他们就会大发雷霆。情感和冲动驱使他们去做他们想做的事，拿他们想拿的东西，砸他们想砸的东西。",
	"You might enjoy playing a character who belongs to the Gruul Clans if one or more of the following sentences are true:": "如果以下一个或多个句子是真的，你可能会喜欢扮演一个属于格鲁尔部族的角色。",

	"The Gruul \"guild\" is actually a collection of different, independent clans loosely united under one powerful leader. When you decide to join the Gruul, you join a specific clan, not the guild as a whole. You can roll a {@dice d8} or choose from the options in the Gruul Clan Options table to determine your character's clan allegiance.": "格鲁尔 \"公会 \"实际上是由不同的、独立的部族组成的集合体，松散地团结在一个强大的领袖之下。当你决定加入格鲁尔时，你会加入一个特定的部族，而不是整个行会。你可以掷出{@dice d8}或从格鲁尔部族选项表中选择，以确定你的角色对部族的忠诚度。",

	"The rites of becoming Gruul, whether you have come from outside the guild or are marking your entrance into adulthood, center around being buried alive. When you enter the shallow grave, the person you were before is dead. Your past wrongs and errors are forgotten, but so are your past accomplishments.

The clan leaders recognize you only when you earn glory in battle as a Gruul.": "成为格鲁尔的仪式，无论你是来自行会外，还是标志着你进入成年，都是以被活埋为中心。当你进入浅浅的坟墓时，你之前的那个人已经死了。你过去的错误和失误被遗忘，但你过去的成就也被遗忘。无论你以前在战斗中证明自己有多好，当你从土里爬出来时，你是未经考验的。只有当你作为格鲁尔人在战斗中赢得荣耀时，氏族领袖才会认可你。",
	"Most of the Gruul find their place among the fierce warriors of their clans. If you are a fighter, ranger, or barbarian, this is your natural role. Gruul fighters tend to adopt the Champion archetype, Gruul rangers usually adopt the Hunter or the Beast Master archetype, and Gruul barbarians follow either the Path of the Totem Warrior or the Path of the Berserker. Whatever your class, as a Gruul warrior you are devoted to tearing down the edifices of civilization, both physical and institutional. You lash out at a system that you believe is the root of corruption and weakness.": "大多数格鲁尔人在他们的部族中找到了自己的位置，那就是凶猛的战士。如果你是一个战士、游侠或野蛮人，这就是你的自然角色。格鲁尔战士倾向于采用冠军原型，格鲁尔游侠通常采用猎人或野兽大师原型，而格鲁尔野蛮人则遵循图腾战士之路或者狂战士之路。无论你是哪种类型，作为格鲁尔战士，你都致力于拆毁文明的建筑，包括物质和制度。你对你认为是腐败和软弱的根源的制度进行抨击。",
	"If you are spellcaster, such as a druid (usually of the Circle of the Moon) or a cleric of the Tempest Domain, you might adopt a more spiritual role in your clan. You practice what the Gruul call the Old Ways, a discipline that predates the foundation of civilization on Ravnica, to channel the primal energy that still pulses through the wild places of the world.": "如果你是施法者，比如德鲁伊（通常是月之环）或暴风域的牧师，你可能会在你的部族中扮演更多的精神角色。你修炼格鲁尔人所谓的 \"古老的方法\"，这是一门早于拉夫尼卡文明基础的学科，以引导仍然在世界的荒野中跳动的原始能量。",
	"The {@background Gruul Anarch|ggr} background is available for characters who are part of the Gruul guild.": "{@background Gruul Anarch|ggr}的背景对属于格鲁尔行会的角色可用。",
	"A group of Gruul adventurers can serve as a raiding party to pursue the goals of one clan or the guild as a whole. The combination of anarchs and berserkers (fighters, rangers, and barbarians) with druids of the Old Ways (druids or clerics) creates a powerful mix of muscle and magic. Such a party lacks the capacity for subtlety or stealth, but Gruul missions rarely require such abilities. (A ranger can provide them, in the rare case where they are necessary.)": "一群格鲁尔冒险者可以作为一个突击队，追求一个部族或整个公会的目标。无政府主义者和狂暴者（战士、游侠和野蛮人）与古老的德鲁伊（德鲁伊或牧师）的组合创造了一个强大的肌肉和魔法组合。这样的队伍缺乏微妙或隐蔽的能力，但格鲁尔任务很少需要这种能力。(游侠可以提供这些能力，在罕见的情况下，他们是必要的。)",
	"Renown among the Gruul could also be called glory—when you prove yourself in battle, you earn the respect of your fellows. With glory comes acceptance of your leadership and warriors willing to follow you into battle. The Gruul have no formal holders of titles aside from the chieftains of clans and the guildmaster, but relative status within one's clan is still important.": "在格鲁尔人中的声望也可以称为荣耀--当你在战斗中证明自己时，你就会赢得伙伴们的尊重。随着荣耀的到来，人们接受你的领导，战士们也愿意跟随你去战斗。除了部族首领和公会会长之外，格鲁尔人没有正式的头衔持有者，但在部族中的相对地位仍然很重要。",
	"With several battles under your belt, you have demonstrated service to your clan and earned the recognition of your peers. You have the right to tattoo your body to commemorate your triumphs in battle and demonstrate your loyalty to the Gruul. You don't yet have authority over others, but when you go into battle with your clan, your fellow warriors fight near you, acknowledging your prowess. Your clan chieftain knows your name and might decide to single you out, offering you an opportunity to prove yourself by performing a special task. Depending on the nature of the task, the chieftain might send {@dice 1d4} {@creature Anarch|GGR|anarchs} along to help you.": "随着几场战斗的进行，你已经展示了对你的部族的服务，并赢得了同行的认可。你有权在身上纹身，以纪念你在战斗中的胜利，展示你对格鲁尔的忠诚。你还没有权力支配别人，但当你和你的部族一起战斗时，你的同伴会在你身边战斗，承认你的能力。你的族长知道你的名字，并可能决定把你挑出来，为你提供一个机会，通过执行一项特殊任务来证明自己。根据任务的性质，首领可能会派{@dice 1d4}{@creature Anarch|GGR|anarchs}的人去帮助你。",
	"When you reach this level of renown, you develop a rapport with the beasts that haunt the rubblebelts. When you are in a rubblebelt area, you can summon one beast to be your mount: a batterboar (a {@creature giant boar} as described in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}), a ceratok (using the stat block of a {@creature rhinoceros}), or a raktusk (equivalent to a {@creature giant elk}). It doesn't fight for you unless you have magic or another ability that can control a beast.": "当你达到这个声望水平时，你就会与在废墟地带出没的野兽建立起一种默契。当你在瓦砾带地区时，你可以召唤一只野兽作为你的坐骑：一只巴特波尔（{@book Monster Manual|MM}中描述的{@creature giant boar}），一只瑟拉托克（使用{@creature rhinoceros}的状态块），或一只拉克塔斯克（相当于{@creature giant elk}）。除非你有魔法或其他可以控制野兽的能力，否则它不会为你战斗。",

	"You can now rightfully challenge your chieftain in single combat for leadership of the clan or take the warriors loyal to you and form a new clan.": "你现在可以理直气壮地在单挑中挑战你的酋长，争夺部族的领导权，或者带着忠于你的战士组成一个新的部族。",
	"By standing in opposition to the civilized ways of the other guilds, the Gruul Clans have made it practically impossible to establish alliances with those guilds.": "由于站在其他公会的文明方式的对立面，格鲁尔氏族实际上已经不可能与这些公会建立联盟。",
	"Similar to the Golgari, Selesnya, and Simic, the Gruul respect nature and maintain a close relationship with animals—in the Gruul's case, the monstrous beasts that stalk the rubble and ruins. But the Gruul would just as soon smash the sewers, gardens, and laboratories of those other guilds than cooperate with them in an effort to establish nature as a larger presence within the city.": "与Golgari、Selesnya和Simic类似，格鲁尔人尊重自然，并与动物保持密切的关系--在格鲁尔人看来，就是那些在瓦砾和废墟中游荡的怪兽。但格鲁尔人很快就会捣毁那些其他行会的下水道、花园和实验室，而不是与他们合作，努力在城市中建立自然界的更大存在。",
	"Because they see all of the remaining guilds as cogs in the vast machine of civilization, the Gruul tailor their tactics toward breaking the machine, rather than directing their attacks at any particular guild. Any guild can be the target of Gruul aggression, as the opportunity arises. The fiercest assaults often come against the guilds that take it upon themselves to combat the Gruul, primarily the Boros and Azorius.": "因为他们把所有剩余的公会看作是文明的巨大机器中的齿轮，格鲁尔人把他们的战术定位于打破这个机器，而不是把他们的攻击指向任何特定的公会。只要有机会，任何公会都可能成为格鲁尔的攻击目标。最猛烈的攻击往往是针对那些自己动手打击格鲁尔的行会，主要是波洛和阿佐里斯。",
	"In certain circumstances, such as when some nightmarish horror rears its head in the heart of a rubblebelt, you and your clan could accept the help of members of another guild in putting an end to the danger. Or, when the schemes of other guilds pit one clan against another, there might be some benefit to you and your clan in cooperating with those efforts. But your truest allies are other members of your clan.": "在某些情况下，比如当一些噩梦般的恐怖在瓦砾地带的中心出现时，你和你的部族可以接受另一个公会成员的帮助来结束危险。或者，当其他公会的计划使一个部族与另一个部族对抗时，你和你的部族与这些努力合作，可能会有一些好处。但你最真实的盟友是你的家族的其他成员。",
	"Since every other guild participates to some extent in the establishment and sustenance of the civilization that the Gruul despise, the Gruul look down on all other guilds as soft, corrupt, or downright abhorrent.": "由于其他每个公会都在某种程度上参与了格鲁尔人所鄙视的文明的建立和维持，所以格鲁尔人看不起其他所有的公会，认为它们软弱、腐败，或者完全令人憎恶。",

	"The Izzet mages weren't hard to find. After a couple of days of observation, Jace heard an explosion and saw a startled flight of birds from across the district. The plume of blue smoke was a telltale sign of one of the Izzet's pyrotechnic experiments. Jace tracked the source of the blast and spied two mages, a human and a goblin, outfitted with alchemical gadgetry and mizzium gauntlets. They emerged from a disused tunnel, leaving behind charred bricks and a haze of smoke, and their instruments crackled with energy. From what Jace had gathered, this was the Izzet style of research: keep adding energy until something blows up, then observe the results.": "伊泽特法师并不难找。经过几天的观察，杰斯听到了爆炸声，看到了来自整个地区的惊飞的鸟。那股蓝烟是伊扎特人的一个烟火实验的标志。杰斯跟踪了爆炸的源头，发现了两个法师，一个是人类，一个是地精，装备着炼金术的小工具和米兹恩护手。他们从一条废弃的隧道中走出来，留下了烧焦的砖块和一片烟霾，他们的仪器发出了能量的噼啪声。从杰斯收集到的信息来看，这是伊泽特人的研究风格：不断增加能量，直到某物爆炸，然后观察结果。",
	"The Izzet are obsessive experimenters, combining a keen creative intellect with a short attention span.

Then, after a few goblin volunteers vanish inside it, the apparatus gains the designation of \"universal refuse disintegrator\"—until the goblin volunteers are discovered alive, having been teleported far from the workshop. This sort of adjustment is par for the course in Izzet experiments; the \"fiddle and find out\" method is favored over any process of systematic scientific research.": "联盟最宏大的实验通常涉及公共工程项目和元素实验。这些努力使用一种依赖于意外结果的方法：所有的结果都是有信息的，即使它们完全违背了预期。例如，一个以创造 \"超马纳聚焦透镜 \"开始的实验，一旦研究人员发现他们所制造的东西的更多特性，可能会被重新命名为 \"scram-range teleportal\"。然后，在几个地精志愿者在里面消失后，这个设备就会被命名为 \"通用垃圾分解器\"--直到这些地精志愿者被发现还活着，被传送到远离车间的地方。这种调整在伊泽特的实验中是很正常的；\"摆弄和发现 \"的方法比任何系统的科学研究过程都更受欢迎。",

Some grand-scale experiments draw on the resources of an entire laboratory, while others are a lone visionary's labor of love.": "Izzet实验室在一种持续的高能量状态下运作，推动研究人员从一个实验到下一个实验。一些大规模的实验利用了整个实验室的资源，而另一些实验则是一个人的爱心之作。",

	"{@b Goblins} embody the Izzet's unrestrained enthusiasm for their endeavors. They epitomize the recklessness of Izzet mages, and some participate as subjects in hazardous experiments—even ones of their own devising.

This attitude can irritate and alienate their guild mates—and put the vedalken in harm's way when an experiment goes awry.": "{@b Vedalken}与他们的Izzet同胞相比，往往更专注、更有组织、更精明，因此他们经常在公会的实验室中担任项目的领导者。一些维达尔肯人对工作非常执着，他们喜欢亲自查看每一个细节，而不是将任何任务委托给下属或助手。这种态度可能会激怒和疏远他们的公会成员--当实验出现问题时，会使vedalken处于危险境地。",
	"The Izzet League thirsts for knowledge, cherishes intellect, and speculates about the secrets of the multiverse. It brings to its scientific pursuits a flaming passion that turns its search for knowledge into an insatiable hunger, makes its cold intellect brilliantly fruitful, and widens its speculation into a search for connections between wildly disparate objects or concepts. It is manic in its expressions of creative energy, shifting from careful analysis to intuitive leap seemingly for no reason, always thinking outside the proverbial box. As the Izzet see it, unpredictable action, far from being antithetical to methodical research, has experimental value. In the words of one researcher, \"The only action worth taking is one with an unknown outcome.\"": "伊泽特联盟渴求知识，珍视智力，并猜测多元宇宙的秘密。它为其科学追求带来了燃烧的激情，将其对知识的探索变成了一种永不满足的饥渴，使其冰冷的智力取得了辉煌的成果，并将其推测扩大到寻找天壤之别的物体或概念之间的联系。它在表达创造性的能量时是狂躁的，从仔细的分析转变为直觉的跳跃，似乎没有任何理由，总是在众所周知的盒子之外思考。在伊扎特人看来，不可预测的行动远不是与有条不紊的研究对立，而是具有实验价值。用一位研究人员的话说，\"唯一值得采取的行动是具有未知结果的行动\"。",
	"For the rest of the guild members, the search for bigger and better weapons is mainly an opportunity to engage in all sorts of wild research while abandoning all outward pretense of safety or reason.

Goblins relish this sort of work, while other folk seek promotion into a new position as quickly as possible.": "大多数伊泽特新兵开始他们的职业生涯是作为随从。在为更强大的法师服务的过程中，一个由多达40名随从组成的团队从事记录和整理信息（有时在危险的情况下）、获取稀有物品或元素（通常在危险的情况下），或完成实验（总是在危险的情况下）等工作。地精喜欢这种工作，而其他民工则寻求尽快晋升到一个新的职位。",
	"If you are a spellcaster, such as a sorcerer or a wizard, the easiest way up and out of your position is by proving your skill with magic. Most Izzet sorcerers get their magic from the Wild Magic origin, but a few claim a Draconic Bloodline. Izzet wizards tend to specialize in the School of Conjuration, Evocation, or Transmutation. As an Izzet spellcaster, you are probably connected to a particular laboratory, either one described in the \"Inside the Izzet\" section or a less prominent one focused on a narrower topic.

This party lacks healing ability, but alchemist-crafted healing potions can help sustain the party in the absence of a dedicated healer.": "一个完全由Izzet成员组成的队伍可能是一个法师（魔法师或巫师），由卫兵（战士）和随从（任何等级）陪同。公会的结构通常假定法师负责引导整个团队，但其他任何角色都有可能成为行动的真正首脑。这支队伍缺乏治疗能力，但炼金术士制作的治疗药水可以在没有专门治疗师的情况下帮助维持队伍。",
	"Renown within the Izzet League brings with it more responsibility in your chosen field of study, as well as an increasing ability to choose the activities that interest you.

	"The Orzhov's original function was both religious and financial, with the two functions closely related. As Ravnica's dominant church, the Orzhov continues to preach an oppressive message that equates sin with debt and promises forgiveness to those who make tithes and donations. As Ravnica's principal bank, it stores and secures the riches of the city, collecting interest at high rates to expand its own wealth.

	"Orzhov churches and basilicas are scattered across the city, each one led by a ministrant with a staff of knights and syndics.

	"To boost their declining profits in a vacillating economy, the Orzhov have begun offering protection services, promising to shield their \"customers\" from both physical harm and fiscal disaster.

In times past, the Orzhov danced along the edges of the law and presented an appearance of legality, but the combination of an ever-expanding legal code and the guild's move into racketeering and other explicitly illegal activities has made it vulnerable to Azorius enforcement. So far, the Azorius have demonstrated more interest in cracking down on the chaotic activity of the Gruul and the {@creature Rakdos|GGR}, but Azorius arresters also routinely shut down Orzhov protection rackets and take enforcers into custody. To make matters worse, the Azorius Senate's increasing use of precognitive magic is proving difficult for the Orzhov to work around.": "Azorius是Orzhov运营的最大威胁。在过去，Orzhov在法律的边缘跳舞，呈现出合法的外观，但不断扩大的法律规范和公会进入敲诈勒索和其他明显的非法活动的结合，使其容易受到Azorius的执法。到目前为止，Azorius对打击Gruul和{@creature Rakdos|GGR}的混乱活动表现出更大的兴趣，但Azorius的逮捕者也经常关闭Orzhov的保护网，并将执法者拘留。更糟糕的是，阿索里乌斯元老院越来越多地使用预知魔法，这证明Orzhov人很难应付。",
	"So far, the syndicate's most effective tactic has been to increase the layers of separation between the day-to-day criminal operations of the guild and the leadership, ensuring that no matter how many street-level thugs and syndics are apprehended to fill the Azorius prisons, the guild's leadership remains intact. Contact between the oligarchs and lower-ranking members of the guild is increasingly rare in this situation, and even the pontiffs find it ever more difficult to arrange a hearing with their superiors.": "到目前为止，该集团最有效的策略是增加公会的日常犯罪活动与领导层之间的隔离层，确保无论抓到多少街头混混和集团成员来充实阿佐里乌斯的监狱，公会的领导层都不会受到影响。在这种情况下，寡头和公会的低级成员之间的接触越来越少，甚至连教皇都发现越来越难安排与他们的上级会面了。",

	"At the beginning of your association with the Orzhov, you are regarded as a borrower. Whether you are the wealthy scion of an oligarch family or a penniless citizen deep in debt to the guild, your status is functionally equivalent: you owe everything you have, even your life, to the Orzhov. Your only hope of improving your status is through your service to the guild. As you acquire renown, you can rise above this debased position in the guild hierarchy. Choose one of three parallel tracks of advancement, depending on your capabilities: advokist, enforcer, or priest.": "在你与Orzhov的关系开始时，你被视为一个借贷者。无论你是寡头家族的富家子弟，还是身无分文的市民，你的地位在功能上是等同的：你的一切，甚至你的生命，都欠着Orzhov的。你改善自己地位的唯一希望是通过为公会服务。当你获得声望时，你可以在公会的等级制度中超越这个被贬低的地位。根据你的能力，在三个平行的晋升轨道中选择一个：建议者，执行者，或牧师。",
	"If you are a spellcaster (perhaps a wizard specialized in the School of Abjuration, Divination, or Enchantment), you can aspire to be an advokist—one of the syndicate's lawyers, with duties that include overseeing contracts, representing clients in Azorius courts, and prosecuting those who fail to pay their debts. Some clerics of the Order Domain also choose to pursue this path.": "如果你是一个施法者（也许是一个专攻咒语、占卜或魔法学校的巫师），你可以渴望成为一名顾问--集团的律师，其职责包括监督合同、在阿索瑞斯法庭上代表客户，以及起诉那些未能偿还债务的人。一些教团领域的神职人员也选择了这条道路。",
	"Many advokists draw on the power of law magic to enforce regulations and contracts to the advantage of the guild. They use their magic to draw out the truth from debtors and those who dare to break their contracts with the guild, to ensure that petitioners approach with the proper humility, and to punish those who offend them or violate their contracts. Some advokists (particularly specialists in the School of Abjuration) also deal in encrypting texts, warding vaults and secret meeting rooms, fortifying structures, and cloaking important personages in magical protections.": "许多建议者利用法律魔法的力量来执行法规和合同，以利于公会的发展。他们用自己的魔法从债务人和那些敢于违背与公会签订的合同的人那里找出真相，确保请愿者以适当的谦逊态度接近，并惩罚那些冒犯他们或违反合同的人。一些咨询师（尤其是咒语学校的专家）还从事文本加密、守护金库和秘密会议室、加固结构以及为重要人物披上魔法保护的工作。",
	"Enforcers guard Orzhov property and protect the guild's bureaucrats, administrators, and aristocrats. You might be the muscle who collects protection money and debt payments from the syndicate's clients, or an assassin (euphemistically called a euthanist) who brings speedy ends to lives deemed to have gone on too long. Most Orzhov enforcers are fighters. Rogue enforcers typically emulate the Thief or Assassin archetype.": "执法者守护Orzhov的财产，保护公会的官僚、行政人员和贵族。你可能是向集团的客户收取保护费和债务的人，或者是一个刺客（委婉地称为安乐死），为被认为已经持续太久的生命带来快速的结束。大多数Orzhov执法者都是战士。流氓执法者通常效仿盗贼或刺客的原型。",
	"If you are cleric (most likely of the Order Domain), you can aspire to serve an important function in the Orzhov Syndicate, which continues to maintain the outward appearance of a religious institution. Once you earn a position of respect in the syndicate, you will hear confessions and dole out penance (which is always of a financial nature). Your \"calling\" centers on collecting monetary tithes and offerings in a wide range of forms. Your spellcasting ability comes from the collective power of the spirits that rule the guild, not from a god.": "如果你是教士（很可能是教团领域的），你可以渴望在奥尔佐夫集团中担任重要的职务，该集团继续保持着宗教机构的外表。一旦你在集团中赢得了一个受人尊敬的位置，你就会听取忏悔并进行忏悔（这总是财务性质的）。你的 \"使命 \"集中在收集各种形式的货币什一税和献金上。你的法术能力来自统治公会的灵魂的集体力量，而不是来自一个神。",
	"You might even be a most unusual priest for the syndicate—one who thinks the guild's wealth should be used to ease the suffering of the downtrodden. You might also believe in the inspiration and delight that beautiful pageantry can offer to the world. If you seek to distribute wealth and share beauty, rather than hoard them, you must do so discreetly to avoid the ire of the Obzedat.": "你甚至可能是一个对集团来说最不寻常的牧师--一个认为公会的财富应该被用来减轻受压迫者的痛苦的人。你也可能相信美丽的庆典活动能给世界带来灵感和快乐。如果你寻求分配财富和分享美丽，而不是囤积它们，你必须谨慎地这样做，以避免引起奥贝扎特的愤怒。",

	"An Orzhov adventuring party might be assembled in one of two ways. If its primary purpose is the application of brute force, some number of hulking enforcers (fighters) form the core of the ground, perhaps supported by a stealthy \"euthanist\" (rogue) and a knight (paladin). A priest (cleric) could provide additional magical support.": "一个Orzhov冒险团可能以两种方式之一组建。如果它的主要目的是运用蛮力，那么一些大块头的执行者（战士）就构成了地面的核心，也许由一个隐蔽的 \"安乐死\"（流氓）和一个骑士（圣骑士）支持。一个牧师（教士）可以提供额外的魔法支持。",
	"If the group is more focused on the political scheming of the Orzhov, involving the use of persuasion and coercion rather than outright force, a priest (cleric) and an advokist (wizard) will probably lead the group, accompanied by more sophisticated bodyguards (fighters or rogues).": "如果这个团体更专注于奥哲夫的政治阴谋，涉及到使用说服和胁迫而不是直接的武力，那么一个牧师（教士）和一个advokist（巫师）可能会领导这个团体，由更复杂的保镖（战士或流氓）陪同。",

With increasing rank comes a greater degree of leverage over those who occupy the ranks below you.": "Orzhov坚持非常严格的权力结构。只有在组织的最底层才会有职位空缺，而在等级上的提升需要最大的奉献精神。随着级别的提高，对那些占据你下面级别的人有更大程度的影响力。",
	"Syndics are low-ranking functionaries. At this level of the hierarchy, you can expect deference from borrowers, who will perform small favors that require no significant risk, effort, or cost. The bulk of your work for the guild, in turn, involves doing favors for those above you.": "辛迪加是低级别的职能部门。在这个层次上，你可以期望从借款人那里得到尊重，他们会做一些不需要重大风险、努力或成本的小恩惠。而你为公会所做的大部分工作，则是为你上面的人提供帮助。",
	"As a priest of this rank, you can perform minor tasks in an Orzhov church: collecting tithes at the door, scheduling appointments for the senior priests, keeping ledgers, and the like. As an advokist, you copy documents, research legal precedent, depose witnesses, and otherwise assist more senior guild members. As an enforcer, you flex your muscle to collect minor debts that are of little importance to the guild as a whole.": "作为这个等级的牧师，你可以在奥尔乔夫教堂里执行一些小任务：在门口收取什一税，为高级牧师安排约会，保存账簿，等等。作为一名顾问，你可以复制文件，研究法律先例，传唤证人，以及以其他方式协助更高级的公会成员。作为一名执法者，你要施展你的力量，收取对整个行会来说并不重要的小债务。",
	"Each knight carries a title that expresses a quality of character, such as Knight of Penance or Knight of Despair. As a knight, you have authority over syndics, and you are trusted—so far as anyone in the Orzhov Syndicate trusts anyone else—to transport large sums of money. You also have access to sufficient funds to maintain a comfortable lifestyle between adventures.": "每个骑士都有一个表达性格品质的头衔，如忏悔骑士或绝望骑士。作为一名骑士，你有管理集团的权力，而且你被信任--就像奥尔乔夫集团中的任何人信任其他人一样--可以运送大笔资金。你还可以获得足够的资金来维持冒险之间的舒适生活。",
	"As a priest of this rank, you hear confessions and collect penance, lead rites (and take offerings), perform ceremonies, and offer counsel to your superiors when asked.

	"Sometimes adherence to order can get in the way of an efficient crime operation, though, and that's when the Orzhov part ways with the other law-and-order guilds—especially the Azorius.

Alternatively, you might team up with members of a chaotic guild to bring down an opponent that is causing too much trouble for Orzhov operations.": "从其他行会获得个人盟友的最好方法是让他们欠你什么。借款人很少成为友好或特别忠诚的盟友，但他们可以成为有用的棋子。如果你们有共同的敌人，你可能会与其他公会的成员结成真正的联盟：过度的阿索瑞斯或波洛斯，迪米尔的间谍或戈尔加里的刺客，或者格鲁尔和{@creature Rakdos|GGR}的横行霸道和过度行为。另外，你可能会与一个混乱公会的成员合作，扳倒一个给奥卓夫行动带来太多麻烦的对手。",

	"Jace walked into the {@creature Rakdos|GGR} club, pushing into a wall of scents and sounds. The ceilings were surprisingly high inside, draped with banners and spiked chains. An impish creature hooted as it dangled from a high wire while a man in leather chaps swallowed orbs of fire and breathed them back out through his snaggly teeth. Scarred, black-scaled drakes fought viciously in cages that swung from the ceiling, and the stink of sweat and singed flesh wafted from adjoining alcoves. Against the wall stood an enormous sentry, somewhere along the spectrum between rotund man and compact giant, dressed in what looked like the motley of a harlequin jester crossed with barbed wire.": "杰斯走进{@creature Rakdos|GGR}俱乐部，挤进一堵气味和声音的墙。里面的天花板出乎意料地高，挂着横幅和带刺的链子。一个不怀好意的生物在高高的钢丝上晃来晃去，而一个穿着皮靴的人吞下了火球，并通过他那粗糙的牙齿把火球吐了出来。伤痕累累的黑鳞龙在天花板上悬挂的笼子里恶斗，汗水和烧焦的肉体的臭味从相邻的小房间飘出。靠墙站着一个巨大的哨兵，介于粗壮的男人和紧凑的巨人之间，穿着像小丑的杂色衣服，身上还缠着铁丝网。",
	"The Cult of {@creature Rakdos|GGR} bears the name of the demon lord who founded it. As laid out in the Guildpact, the guild was intended to fill roles concerning entertainment, mining, and manual labor. Some argue that any effort to give a demonic cult a respectable role in society was doomed to failure, but the cult remains part of Ravnica's social fabric nevertheless. The Guildpact prohibits the cult's extermination, and its entertainments—even as dark and destructive as they are—hold broad appeal. From rowdy mobs who love to see the {@creature Rakdos|GGR} skewer the powerful elites to decadent socialites who come to the {@creature Rakdos|GGR} for illicit amusements, most of Ravnica's people don't really want the {@creature Rakdos|GGR} to go away, as much as they might publicly protest otherwise.": "崇拜{@creature Rakdos|GGR}的名字来自于创建它的恶魔领主。正如《行会契约》中所规定的，该行会旨在填补有关娱乐、采矿和体力劳动的角色。有些人认为，让恶魔教派在社会中扮演一个受人尊敬的角色的任何努力都是注定要失败的，但该教派仍然是拉夫尼卡社会结构的一部分。行会契约》禁止消灭该邪教，而它的娱乐活动--即使是黑暗和破坏性的--也有广泛的吸引力。从喜欢看{@creature Rakdos|GGR}的暴徒到到{@creature Rakdos|GGR}的颓废的社会名流，大多数拉夫尼卡人并不希望{@creature Rakdos|GGR}消失，尽管他们可能公开抗议。",
	"As one of Ravnica's original guild founders, the demon {@creature Rakdos|GGR} has been part of Ravnica for millennia. Members of other guilds know {@creature Rakdos|GGR} through his reputation for capricious cruelty and megalomania, but those who join the guild idolize him for his magnetic presence, which inspires art and encourages utter wantonness. Because {@creature Rakdos|GGR} finds destruction entertaining, his cultists incorporate deadly acts into their performances in hopes of catching his eye and earning his favor.": "作为拉夫尼卡最初的公会创始人之一，恶魔{@creature Rakdos|GGR}已经成为拉夫尼卡千年的一部分。其他公会的成员通过他任性残忍和自大狂的名声了解{@creature Rakdos|GGR}，但那些加入公会的人则因为他的磁性存在而崇拜他，这激发了艺术，鼓励了完全的恣意妄为。因为{@creature Rakdos|GGR}觉得破坏很有趣，他的崇拜者将致命的行为纳入他们的表演中，希望能吸引他的注意并赢得他的青睐。",
	"Stages for {@creature Rakdos|GGR} performances appear on streets and plazas throughout Ravnica every night, and they're gone by morning—carried to and from on the backs of giants.

	"The Cult of {@creature Rakdos|GGR} is centered on a demon lord who exemplifies the concepts of chaos and evil. At its worst, the cult is driven by a lust for power, extreme selfishness, and a lack of compassion. Cultists take delight in causing pain to others to make sure they know their place, which is subservient to the powerful adherents of this self-centered philosophy.": "{@creature Rakdos|GGR}邪教的中心是一个恶魔领主，他体现了混乱和邪恶的概念。在最糟糕的情况下，该邪教是由权力欲、极端自私和缺乏同情心所驱动。邪教分子以给别人带来痛苦为乐，以确保他们知道自己的位置，也就是服从于这种以自我为中心的哲学的强大信徒。",
	"The cult's chaotic nature fuels its passion, impulsiveness, and obsession with freedom. A guild of unbridled hedonism, it does what it wants, driven by base desires and a strong streak of cruelty.": "邪教的混乱性质助长了其激情、冲动和对自由的痴迷。作为一个不受约束的享乐主义行会，它为所欲为，由基本的欲望和强烈的残忍倾向所驱动。",

	"The anarchic nature of the Cult of {@creature Rakdos|GGR}—aside from the absolute rulership of {@creature Rakdos|GGR} himself—makes rank a meaningless concept to the members of the guild. Nevertheless, renown matters: performers who are well known within the guild also tend to be well known outside the guild, which means larger audiences. Renown in the Cult of {@creature Rakdos|GGR} is the difference between being a bit player in someone else's performance and being the ringmaster of your own show.": "除了{@creature Rakdos|GGR}本人的绝对统治外，{@creature Rakdos|GGR}邪教的无政府性质使得等级对公会成员来说是一个毫无意义的概念。尽管如此，名声还是很重要的：在行会内知名度高的表演者在行会外也很有名，这意味着更多的观众。在{@creature Rakdos|GGR}邪教中的名声是在别人的表演中担任小角色和在自己的表演中担任主演的区别。",

	"When you become a blood witch, you are assigned to torment a particular enemy of the guild. This enemy can be an individual, a family, an organization, or even an abstract concept.

	"A cult of demon worshipers doesn't make a lot of friends. Ideologically, the {@creature Rakdos|GGR} have the most in common with the Gruul and the Golgari; all three guilds have a desire to topple the structures of power in Ravnica. Of course, the guilds disagree about what (or who) should replace the existing structures.": "一个恶魔崇拜者的邪教是不会有很多朋友的。在意识形态上，{@creature Rakdos|GGR}与格鲁尔(Gruul)和戈尔加里(Golgari)的共同点最多；这三个公会都有推翻拉夫尼卡权力结构的愿望。当然，对于什么（或谁）应该取代现有的结构，各公会有不同意见。",
	"Making the powerful look ridiculous lies at the heart of the {@creature Rakdos|GGR} performance philosophy.

	"Making the ridiculous powerful is the flip side of the {@creature Rakdos|GGR} philosophy. Usually, this means elevating the status of the {@creature Rakdos|GGR}—and yourself—at the expense of others, but circumstances might lead you to cooperate with members of other guilds in pursuit of a common goal. For example, a power struggle in another guild can be an opportunity for you to install a sympathetic (or ineffectual) leader in that guild. Beyond that, other chaotic guilds have grudges against the law-enforcing guilds and would be happy to join your efforts to strike a blow against them.": "让可笑的人变得强大是{@creature Rakdos|GGR}理念的反面。通常，这意味着提升{@creature Rakdos|GGR}--和你自己--的地位，而牺牲其他人的利益，但情况可能会导致你与其他公会的成员合作，追求共同的目标。例如，另一个行会的权力斗争可以成为你在该行会中安插一个有同情心的（或无效的）领导人的机会。除此之外，其他混乱的行会对执法的行会有怨恨，会很乐意加入你的努力，对他们进行打击。",

	"Selesnya troops poured into the streets, emptying the nature temples, wildlife preserves, and other green spaces controlled by the conclave. The centaurs' hooves clattered on the cobblestones and the wolf-riders bounded over stone bridges. Human and elf infantry flooded through the arteries of the district, streaming past intersections and flowing around buildings. Griffons and their riders swooped down out of a blanket of low clouds, strafing past the spires. Emmara rode on the shoulder of a massive creature made of a snarl of marble, wood, and vines, her hand resting on its great head. Two more of the nature behemoths strode ahead of her, swinging their limbs in slow motion, indenting the streets with their footfalls as the other Selesnya troops ran between their legs. Below her, Captain Calomir led the Selesnya army. He rode his white war rhino, driving the Selesnya ranks forward, guiding them through the streets toward the {@creature Rakdos|GGR} horde.": "塞勒斯尼亚军队涌入街道，清空了自然庙宇、野生动物保护区和其他由协约国控制的绿色空间。半人马的马蹄在鹅卵石上哒哒作响，狼骑兵在石桥上飞奔。人类和精灵的步兵涌入该区的动脉，流过十字路口，在建筑物周围流动。狮鹫和它们的骑手从一片低矮的云层中俯冲下来，从尖顶上扫过。艾玛拉骑在一个由大理石、木头和藤蔓组成的巨大生物的肩膀上，她的手放在它巨大的头上。还有两只自然界的巨兽在她前面漫步，慢悠悠地摆动着四肢，当其他塞勒斯尼亚部队在它们的腿间奔跑时，它们的脚步声在街道上留下了痕迹。在她下面，卡洛米尔上尉领导着塞勒斯尼亚军队。他骑着他的白色战犀牛，驱使塞勒斯尼亚的队伍前进，引导他们穿过街道，走向{@creature Rakdos|GGR}部落。",
	"Like a thriving garden, carefully tended and abundantly fertile, the communities of the Selesnya Conclave are a harmonious union of nature and civilization. The members of the conclave dream of embracing all of Ravnica in their peaceful union. In the meantime, they are growing an army, preparing to resist the ambition and destructive impulses of the other guilds and fight to defend their way of life.": "就像一个欣欣向荣的花园，精心打理，丰饶肥沃，塞勒斯尼亚协约国的社区是自然与文明的和谐结合。协约国的成员们梦想在他们的和平联盟中拥抱整个拉夫尼卡。同时，他们正在壮大军队，准备抵抗其他公会的野心和破坏性冲动，为捍卫自己的生活方式而战。",
	"At the heart of the Selesnya faith and philosophy is the Worldsoul, called Mat'Selesnya, which its devotees believe to be a manifestation of nature itself. At the signing of the original Guildpact, Mat'Selesnya was embodied in an elemental form and acted as the guild's first guildmaster. The current guildmaster, {@creature Trostani|GGR}—three dryads fused together with Mat'Selesnya into a single being—is said to embody the will of the Worldsoul in a similar way. The original mission of the conclave involved conservation and charity, but its focus has long been on expanding its community, in which all members are cared for and nature is preserved in harmony with civilization.": "塞勒斯尼亚信仰和哲学的核心是世界之魂，称为马特塞勒斯尼亚，其信徒认为它是自然本身的一种表现。在签署最初的公会契约时，马特-塞勒斯尼亚以一种元素的形式体现出来，并担任公会的第一任公会会长。目前的公会会长，{@creature Trostani|GGR}--三个干尸与马特-塞勒斯尼亚融合成一个整体--据说以类似的方式体现了世界之魂的意志。协约国最初的使命是保护和慈善，但它的重点长期以来一直是扩大其社区，在其中所有成员都得到照顾，自然与文明和谐共存。",
	"The Selesnya Conclave is organized into enclaves called vernadi, which are communes built around central trees. The vernadi are smaller versions of the guildhall, the great city-tree Vitu-Ghazi. A dryad, called a voda, is called forth from that central tree to be the leader of the community, connecting the vernadi and its devotees to the Worldsoul and uniting them with the will of the entire conclave.": "塞勒斯尼亚协约国被组织成称为 \"维尔纳迪 \"的飞地，这些飞地是围绕中心树而建的公社。vernadi是市政厅的缩小版，即伟大的城市之树Vitu-Ghazi。一个被称为 \"沃达 \"的干尸被从中心树上召唤出来，成为社区的领袖，将弗纳迪及其信徒与世界之魂联系起来，并将他们与整个协约国的意志结合起来。",
	"A voda is accessible to all the guild members in her care. You have regular contact with your voda, who knows your name and has a good idea of your interests, goals, and strengths. And since your voda is mystically linked to the guildmaster, {@creature Trostani|GGR}, through communion with the Worldsoul, it's safe to assume that {@creature Trostani|GGR} knows who you are as well.": "一个voda可以接触到她所照顾的所有行会成员。你可以定期与你的沃达联系，他知道你的名字，并对你的兴趣、目标和力量有很好的了解。由于你的沃达通过与世界之魂的交流，与公会会长{@creature Trostani|GGR}有着神秘的联系，因此可以认为{@creature Trostani|GGR}也知道你是谁。",
	"In addition to the voda, military and religious leaders in each vernadi regularly communicate with its members. Ordinary members of the conclave spend a few hours every day training with a military instructor and studying with a religious teacher.": "除了沃达，每个维尔纳迪的军事和宗教领袖也定期与成员进行交流。协进会的普通成员每天花几个小时与军事教官一起训练，与宗教教师一起学习。",
	"Despite the growing tensions that now grip the world, in the long view of the Selesnya Conclave, not much has changed. Ravnica is troubled, but Ravnica has always been troubled. The Living Guildpact is absent, but the Guildpact comes and goes. The Worldsoul has not changed, nor has the will of Mat'Selesnya: the conclave's main goal is to grow, as it has always been. Its strength lies in its numbers.": "尽管现在世界上的紧张局势日益严重，但从塞勒斯尼亚会议的长远来看，并没有什么变化。拉夫尼卡有麻烦，但拉夫尼卡一直都有麻烦。活着的行会契约不存在，但行会契约来了又走。世界之魂没有改变，马特-塞勒斯尼亚的意志也没有改变：协约国的主要目标是增长，就像它一直以来一样。它的力量在于它的数量。",
	"The conclave clings to the ideal of a peaceful collective in which individual desires are subordinate to the good of the whole group. The guild wants to see this beloved community grow, flourish, and thrive in peace. But as much as it values peace within the community, it displays incredible ferocity when that harmony is threatened.": "协进会坚持和平集体的理想，其中个人的欲望服从于整个团体的利益。公会希望看到这个心爱的社区在和平中成长、繁荣和兴旺。但是，尽管它非常重视社区内的和平，但当这种和谐受到威胁时，它却表现出惊人的凶残。",
	"Selesnya's vision is centered on the idea of harmony between civilization and nature. To advance the cause of civilized society, the conclave believes in the need for an ordered structure that orients the group toward the pursuit of the common good. At the same time, the guild's connection with the natural world gives the conclave a fervent appreciation for the interconnectedness of all things. Selesnya doesn't tolerate selfishness or ambition, instead urging its members to put the needs of others ahead of their own desires and to use the power of nature—including nature's wrath—to drive away those whose selfishness threatens the coherence of the group.": "Selesnya的愿景以文明与自然的和谐理念为中心。为了推进文明社会的事业，协约国相信需要一个有序的结构，使群体朝着追求共同利益的方向发展。同时，公会与自然界的联系让协进会对万物的相互联系有了热切的体会。Selesnya不容忍自私或野心，而是敦促其成员将他人的需求置于自己的欲望之上，并利用自然的力量--包括自然的愤怒--赶走那些自私自利威胁到团体一致性的人。",
	"The greatest danger that Selesnya faces lies in the ambitions of other guilds, which are flourishing in the absence of the Guildpact. Selesnya's way of curbing this grasping selfishness has always been to outnumber the other guilds. Its members aren't naive; they fully realize that the ambitions of other guilds will lead to violence. And they aim to be prepared for that violence when it erupts.": "塞勒斯尼亚面临的最大危险在于其他公会的野心，这些公会在没有公会契约的情况下蓬勃发展。塞勒斯尼亚遏制这种攫取性的自私行为的方法一直是在数量上超过其他公会。它的成员并不天真；他们完全意识到其他公会的野心会导致暴力。而且他们的目标是在暴力爆发时做好准备。",
	"\"For my seedlings to survive,\" Mat'Selesnya says, \"we must grow an army capable of overwhelming such ambitions.\" Some of that army is literally grown, in the case of plant creatures and elementals. A great many members grow up in the guild from childhood and learn their martial skills at the guild's training grounds. And still more join the guild through recruitment—especially in these troubling times, when rumors of war and a sense of imminent doom make Selesnya's message of harmonious community sound ever more appealing.": "\"为了让我的幼苗生存下去，\"马特-塞勒斯尼亚说，\"我们必须培养一支能够压倒这种野心的军队。\" 在植物生物和元素的情况下，这支军队中的一些人是真正成长起来的。许多成员从小就在行会里长大，在行会的训练场上学习他们的武术技能。还有更多的人通过招募加入公会--特别是在这个动荡的时代，当战争的谣言和迫在眉睫的厄运感使塞勒斯尼亚的和谐社区的信息听起来更加吸引人。",

	"New initiates come to the Selesnya Conclave as children, to be brought up by the guild's members, or as recruits drawn from the guildless or the membership of other guilds. Regardless of the path you took to get here, you start out in the role of initiate. As an initiate, you must subsume your desires to the needs of the guild while finding a way (under the guidance of your enclave's leader) to put your talents to use in service to Mat'Selesnya. This effort isn't so much a process of carrying out orders, but of gradually discerning the will of the Worldsoul and finding your place in it.": "新的入会者作为孩子来到塞勒斯尼亚协约，由公会成员抚养长大，或者作为从无公会成员或其他公会成员中招募的新成员。不管你是通过什么途径来到这里的，你都是以入门者的身份开始的。作为入门者，你必须将自己的欲望服从于公会的需要，同时找到一种方法（在你的飞地领导者的指导下），将你的才能用于为马特塞勒斯尼亚服务。这种努力与其说是执行命令的过程，不如说是逐渐分辨出世界之魂的意志并在其中找到自己的位置。",
	"In your search for communion with the Worldsoul, you are part of a worldwide community, but you are also part of a smaller local community—an enclave called a vernadi, which is led by a dryad called a voda. Your role in the conclave is specifically oriented toward your vernadi, at least at the start of your career. Your voda helps you in your process of discerning the will of Mat'Selesnya and your place in relation to it.": "在你寻求与世界灵魂的共融的过程中，你是全球社区的一部分，但你也是一个较小的地方社区的一部分--一个被称为vernadi的飞地，它由一个称为voda的干尸领导。你在 \"协约 \"中的角色是专门面向你的 \"vernadi \"的，至少在你职业生涯的开始阶段是这样。你的voda帮助你辨别Mat'Selesnya的意志以及你在其中的位置。",
	"The Selesnya Conclave is both a community of worshipers and a militia, and thus its leadership includes both military and religious figures.": "塞勒斯尼亚协约组织既是一个崇拜者社区，也是一个民兵组织，因此其领导层包括军事和宗教人物。",
	"Selesnya looks from the outside like a peaceful community, but it is also an army. If you are a fighter, a ranger, or a paladin (usually having sworn the Oath of the Ancients), your place in the guild is a military one. Unlike in the Boros Legion, though, the conclave's military ranks aren't highly structured; each enclave has its own forces, with a single commander and one other layer of command (at most) above the troops. A variety of special military roles become available to you as you prove yourself useful to your vernadi and the conclave. You might aspire to be a votary standing watch over the temple gardens, a sagittar archer, a pegasus-riding equenaut, or a wolf-riding Ledev guardian.": "塞勒斯尼亚从外面看是一个和平的社区，但它也是一支军队。如果你是一名战士、游侠或圣骑士（通常已经宣誓过古人的誓言），你在公会中的地位就是一个军人。但与博罗军团不同的是，协约国的军衔并不是高度结构化的；每个飞地都有自己的部队，在部队之上有一个单一的指挥官和一个其他的指挥层（最多是）。当你证明自己对你的维尔纳迪和协约国有用时，你就可以获得各种特殊的军事角色。你可能渴望成为一名守卫神庙花园的选民、一名萨吉塔弓箭手、一名骑着马的马格纳特人，或者一名骑着狼的莱德夫守护者。",
	"If you are a druid (perhaps of the Circle of the Land), a cleric (of the Life or the Nature Domain), a warlock with the Archfey (Mat'Selesnya) as a patron, or a devout monk (who might follow the Way of the Open Hand), you might be drawn to a role of religious leadership. These leaders mediate the relationship between the members of the conclave and the voice of Mat'Selesnya. A number of special roles will be available to you as you establish your place. You might hope to carry the message of the conclave out into the world as an evangel, and great religious leaders are honored with the title of hierarch.": "如果你是德鲁伊（也许是土地之环）、牧师（生命或自然领域）、以大帝（Mat'Selesnya）为靠山的术士，或者是虔诚的僧侣（可能遵循开放之手之道），你可能会被吸引到一个宗教领袖的角色。这些领导人会调停协进会成员与马特塞勒斯尼亚的声音之间的关系。在你建立自己的位置时，会有一些特殊的角色供你选择。你可能希望以传教士的身份将协进会的信息带向世界，而伟大的宗教领袖会被授予等级制度的称号。",

	"An adventuring party is a community in itself, a symbiotic group in which each individual contributes to the success of the whole. A fighter, a ranger, or a paladin provides a starting point of martial might. A druid or a cleric offers support and healing. A bard or a warlock gives additional spell support. A monk, a bard, or a ranger can add some measure of stealth and skill specialties. Such a group is well equipped to help Selesnya grow—and to smite the guild's enemies.": "一个冒险队伍本身就是一个群体，一个共生的团体，其中每个人都为整体的成功做出贡献。一个战士、一个游侠或一个圣骑士提供了一个武术力量的起点。德鲁伊或牧师提供支持和治疗。吟游诗人或术士提供额外的法术支持。僧侣、吟游诗人或游侠可以增加某种程度的隐身术和技能专长。这样一个团体有很好的装备来帮助塞勒斯尼亚的发展--并击溃公会的敌人。",
	"The Selesnya Conclave doesn't classify its members in a rigid hierarchy, because doing that would encourage individuals to seek to rise above the rest of the community and put their desires above the good of the whole. Thus, aside from the leadership of {@creature Trostani|GGR} over the whole guild, and each voda over her vernadi, the members of the conclave are distinguished mainly by the diverse roles they fill instead of by rank or status.": "塞勒斯尼亚协约国并没有将其成员划分为严格的等级制度，因为这样做会鼓励个人寻求凌驾于社区其他成员之上，将自己的欲望置于整体利益之上。因此，除了{@creature Trostani|GGR}对整个公会的领导，以及每个沃达对她的沃纳迪的领导之外，协约国成员的区别主要在于他们担任的不同角色，而不是等级或地位。",
	"Indeed, many Selesnya initiates never leave that basic role. They have discerned their purpose, and it is to live a proper life in support of the conclave, without pursuing any kind of prestigious role. But if you achieve greater renown in the guild, a variety of special roles become available to you.": "事实上，许多Selesnya入门者从未离开过这个基本角色。他们已经认清了自己的目的，那就是在支持协约国的情况下过上适当的生活，而不追求任何种类的著名角色。但如果你在行会中取得了更大的名声，就会有各种特殊的角色供你选择。",

	"When you become an evangel, you gain one additional contact from a guild other than the Selesnya Conclave, which can be someone you have met in your adventures or chosen from the Non-Selesnya Contacts table earlier in this section. In your new role, you belong to a vernadi and can expect help and support from that community, but you spend your time away from it, operating with a great deal of independence. When you return to your vernadi, you teach and train new initiates.": "当你成为一名传教士时，你会获得一个来自塞勒斯尼亚公会以外的公会的额外联系人，这个人可以是你在冒险中遇到的，或者从本节前面的非塞勒斯尼亚联系人表中选择。在你的新角色中，你属于一个弗纳迪，可以期待来自该社区的帮助和支持，但你在离开弗纳迪的时候，会有很大的独立性。当你回到你的维尔纳迪时，你要教导和训练新的入门者。",

	"Sagittars are archers who defend key guild locations, including the guildhall at Vitu-Ghazi.

	"Historically, the guild's approach to its mission has been one of incremental progress toward a utopian ideal of thriving biology, and it remains more aloof from politics than other guilds. Its fundamental mission remains unchanged by the current political instability, and the isolation of its laboratories protects most Simic guild members from immediate harm.": "从历史上看，该行会对其任务的态度是朝着繁荣的生物学的乌托邦理想逐步推进，而且与其他行会相比，该行会仍然对政治更加冷淡。它的基本使命在当前的政治不稳定中保持不变，而且其实验室的隔离保护了大多数西米克公会成员免受直接伤害。",

	"Vast sinkholes called zonots are the primary geographic divisions among the Simic. Each zonot pierces layer upon layer of crumbled city as it descends deep below the surface and connects to ancient, long-forgotten ocean waters. A zonot is a distinct Simic habitat with its own culture and ecosystem, as well as a leader called a Speaker. The Speakers of all nine zonots form the Speakers' Chamber, and they elect a Prime Speaker from among them to serve as the Simic guildmaster. {@creature Zegana|GGR}, the current Prime Speaker, is the Speaker of Zonot One, which is located in a remote, sparsely inhabited part of Ravnica far from the political activity of the Tenth District.": "被称为 \"分区 \"的巨大天坑是西米克人的主要地理划分。每个天坑都能穿透一层又一层的破碎的城市，因为它深入地表之下，并与古老的、早已被遗忘的海洋水域相连。一个区是一个独特的西米克栖息地，有自己的文化和生态系统，以及一个被称为议长的领导者。所有九个分区的议长组成了议长会议，他们从议长中选出一位首席议长，作为西米克公会的会长。现任首席议长{@creature Zegana|GGR}是一号区的议长，该区位于拉夫尼卡的一个偏远地区，人烟稀少，远离第十区的政治活动。",

In traditional Simic thought, these principles are called the Holdfast and the Upwelling.": "两条相互矛盾的哲学原则结合在一起，使西米克组合对科学和自然采取了独特的方法。在传统的西米克思想中，这些原则被称为 \"坚守 \"和 \"涌流\"。",
	"The Holdfast principle, named for the biological mechanism that keeps kelp and sponges anchored to the sea floor, advises members of the Simic Combine never to stray so far from nature that they become \"adrift.\" It espouses the idea that nature left undisturbed will evolve toward adaptive traits and increased strength.

	"The Upwelling principle, named for the phenomenon of nutrient-rich water rising to the ocean surface, advocates that the new and enlivened should replace the old and depleted in an unending cycle, bringing constant refreshment and renewal.

The Upwelling encourages every creature to discover its full potential.": "上涌原则因营养丰富的水上升到海洋表面的现象而得名，它主张新的和有活力的东西应该在无休止的循环中取代旧的和枯竭的东西，带来持续的清新和更新。这一原则说明了联合体的分析倾向和对知识作为改造手段的强调。学习宇宙的秘密可以让你按照自己的愿望塑造世界。上流社会鼓励每个生物发现其全部潜力。",
	"The Holdfast encourages the Simic to promote nature; the Upwelling urges them to perfect nature.

	"At the same time, a growing faction within the Simic believes that an all-out war among the guilds is inevitable, given the growing unrest in the city. These members, the Adaptationists, believe that the guilds exist in a fragile ecosystem in which the slightest imbalance can have cascading effects. With an absent Living Guildpact failing to maintain the balance, only catastrophe can result. The Simic must change in order to survive, and slow, small steps in pursuit of an ideal vision aren't enough. The future of the guild is in imminent danger, and the Simic need to focus on survival. Adaptationists tend to interpret the Holdfast as being about defense and security, and the Upwelling as a call for sudden, disruptive growth.": "同时，西米克内部有一个越来越大的派别认为，鉴于城市中日益增长的动荡，行会之间的全面战争是不可避免的。这些成员，即适应派，认为公会存在于一个脆弱的生态系统中，其中最轻微的不平衡都会产生连带影响。如果一个缺席的活人行会不能维持平衡，就只能造成灾难。为了生存，西米克必须改变，而为了追求一个理想的愿景而采取缓慢的小步骤是不够的。公会的未来正处于迫在眉睫的危险之中，西米克人需要专注于生存。适应论者倾向于将 \"坚守 \"解释为关于防御和安全，而将 \"上涌 \"解释为对突然的、破坏性增长的呼吁。",
	"As befits members of a guild of scientists, the Adaptationists' preparations for war include the creation of soldiers that are magically and biologically adapted.

Most Simic wizards specialize in the School of Transmutation, using their magic to alter living creatures or alter the natural environment. Simic druids often choose the Circle of the Land, putting similar magic to the guild's service. Those who focus on manipulating life forms are known as biomancers, while those who focus on water, weather, and atmospheric conditions are called terraformers, but you can choose your own path of research.": "如果你是一个施法者，如巫师或德鲁伊，你可以在西米克人中找到一个自然的家，作为一个科学家，用魔法操纵生命和自然的力量，将世界转向公会的乌托邦理想。大多数西米克巫师专攻转化学派，用他们的魔法来改变生物或改变自然环境。西米克德鲁伊通常选择土地之环，将类似的魔法用于公会的服务。那些专注于操纵生命形式的人被称为生物学家，而那些专注于水、天气和大气条件的人被称为土地改造者，但你可以选择自己的研究方向。",
	"If you are playing a Simic hybrid, you initially became involved in Simic research as a test subject in the Guardian Project.

	"You might instead choose an ascetic, contemplative life as a deepsage (perhaps as a wizard or monk). You would devote yourself to meditating on the philosophical principles of the Holdfast and the Upwelling, a pair of complementary ideas that describe the Simic approach to nature and the city. Deepsages inscribe short philosophical riddles, bordering on paradoxes, into shells, exoskeletons, and stones, and Simic guild members reflect on these sayings to advance their understanding of the combine's role in the world. Deepsage wizards typically specialize in the School of Conjuration, and deepsage monks follow the Way of the Four Elements (focusing on air and water over the other two elements).": "你可能会选择一种苦行僧的沉思生活（也许是巫师或僧侣）。你将致力于冥想 \"固定 \"和 \"上升 \"的哲学原则，这是一对互补的想法，描述了西米克人对自然和城市的态度。深海法师在贝壳、外骨骼和石头上刻下简短的哲学谜语，近乎于悖论，而西米克公会成员则反思这些说法，以促进他们对联合体在世界中的作用的理解。西米克巫师通常专攻法术学派，而西米克僧侣则遵循四元素之道（专注于空气和水而非其他两种元素）。",

	"Hosting the work of a successful and important project reflects well on the Speaker of a zonot, so your Speaker keeps a close eye on your work.

	"A vast, winding sewer network runs under the Tenth District, lit by {@spell continual flame} spells. Some of the tunnels are simply storm sewers, meant to carry rainwater (and the debris it washes from the streets) into great cisterns, where it is purified and sent into the pipes in the plumbing system that serves Ravnica's nicer neighborhoods. Others carry waste and refuse out of those neighborhoods, depositing it in different cisterns or dumping it into the subterranean oceans of the undercity.": "一个巨大的、蜿蜒的下水道网络在第十区地下运行，由{@spell continual flame}法术照明。有些隧道仅仅是暴雨下水道，目的是将雨水（以及雨水从街道上冲刷下来的碎片）输送到巨大的蓄水池中，在那里经过净化后被送入水管系统的管道中，为拉夫尼卡较好的社区服务。另一些则是将垃圾和废物运出这些社区，将其存放在不同的蓄水池中，或将其倾倒在城市地下的海洋中。",

	"Known as the Dungeon Palace, this is the guildhall of the Cult of {@creature Rakdos|GGR}, and the lava-filled lair of the demon himself. An immense, crumbling, red stone staircase called the Demon's Vestibule begins the journey from the Smelting District down into the depths, treating travelers to terrifying images depicted on banners as they descend.

Immaculately maintained avenues and manicured gardens create an impression of order, civility, and high culture.

Kept perpetually clean through magic and constantly patrolled by Azorius arresters, the plaza is considered neutral ground for every guild, gang, and faction in the city.

Skarrg is the closest thing the Gruul have to a guildhall—a place where their clans can come together, roast giant boars, boast of their exploits, and form something akin to camaraderie before they go their separate, violent ways. It's not neutral ground, though—old grudges frequently boil over into combat. Outsiders are never welcome.": "格鲁尔部族定期聚集在红色荒原上一座巨大宫殿的残垣断壁上，那里永远燃烧着巨大的篝火。斯卡格是格鲁尔人最接近公会的地方--他们的部族可以聚集在一起，烤大野猪，夸耀他们的功绩，并在他们各奔东西、充满暴力之前形成类似于友情的东西。不过，这里并不是中立的地方，长期以来的怨恨经常会激化成战斗。外来者从不受欢迎。",

	"Much of Precinct Four is a war zone, and mundane methods of law enforcement aren't always effective in such an environment. No one takes the constant patrolling of the Boros Legion as a guarantee of their safety, and almost all folk know how to fight to some degree. Typical threats include giant monsters, unstable elementals, and Gruul raiding parties, and a curfew system is often instituted when a neighborhood is beset by one of these dangers. The only area that is usually safe from external threats is Tin Street. Petty crimes aren't given much attention, since the soldiers are primarily concerned with curbing violence and mayhem.

People of all ages flock to this precinct to spend time learning, whether by poring over texts and scrolls or finding a mentor who will guide a student. It's also the place to find information brokers, who sell specialized or secret knowledge available nowhere else. Multilevel buildings set next to each other with little regard for planning give way to an occasional square or open campus where socially minded residents congregate during daytime hours. At night, many continue their studies while others tinker with their latest creations or intellectual endeavors. Taverns and pubs tend to be more urbane than in other parts of the district and often feature poetry readings, storytelling, and musical performances.": "作为著名大学、古老图书馆和隐藏实验室的所在地，第五区是第十区的信息和学习中心。各个年龄段的人都涌向这个辖区，花时间学习，无论是翻阅文本和卷轴，还是寻找指导学生的导师。这里也是寻找信息经纪人的地方，他们出售其他地方没有的专业或秘密知识。多层建筑彼此相邻，很少考虑规划，偶尔会有一个广场或开放的校园，白天有社会意识的居民在这里聚集。到了晚上，许多人继续学习，而其他人则捣鼓他们最新的创作或智力成果。酒馆和酒吧往往比该区的其他地方更城市化，经常有诗歌朗诵、讲故事和音乐表演。",
	"People who live in Precinct Five have a zeal for learning and tend to be inquisitive. Getting into a heated debate or touting a recent success to your neighbors is part of showing your worth. Good neighbors keep their projects and research hidden until a result can be displayed; it is considered uncouth to allow others to view a work in progress.": "住在第五区的人有学习的热情，并倾向于好奇心。陷入激烈的辩论或向邻居吹嘘最近的成功，是展示自己价值的一部分。好的邻居会把他们的项目和研究隐藏起来，直到可以展示出结果；让别人看到正在进行的工作被认为是不礼貌的。",

	"A crystal-paned center of learning that concentrates on magical theory and application, Prism University draws potential wizards and other would-be mages who want to learn about all forms of magic, in contrast to the specialized and practical applications of magic espoused by the guilds. Even though the school maintains a formal state of neutrality, it's an open secret that many guilds have infiltrated the university and planted agents to woo prospective members. Partly as a result of this influence, many graduates of the university do go on to join a guild, finding a way to apply their broad experience to support the narrower focus of the guild. (A player character spellcaster might well be a graduate of the university, which could explain the character's ability to use magic that wouldn't normally be taught within their guild.)": "棱镜大学是一个专注于魔法理论和应用的学习中心，它吸引了潜在的巫师和其他想要学习各种形式的魔法的法师，这与行会所推崇的专门和实用的魔法应用形成鲜明对比。尽管学校保持着正式的中立状态，但许多公会已经渗透到大学里，并安插了代理人来招揽潜在的成员，这是一个公开的秘密。部分由于这种影响，许多大学的毕业生确实加入了一个公会，找到了一种方法来应用他们广泛的经验来支持公会的狭隘焦点。(一个玩家角色的施法者很可能是大学的毕业生，这可以解释这个角色有能力使用通常不会在他们公会中传授的魔法）。",
	"One of the greatest libraries on all Ravnica, the Ismeri Library is open to all citizens at all hours. Hundreds of thousands of books covering every conceivable subject are found here. The place is also one of the centers of Dimir communication. Secret messages are hidden within its books by a variety of methods both magical and mundane. Dimir agents might have to gather message fragments hidden within several different documents, for example, to find their next assignments or targets. Intricate codes and magical wards protect other secrets.": "作为整个拉夫尼卡最伟大的图书馆之一，伊斯梅里图书馆在任何时候都对所有公民开放。这里有几十万本涵盖所有可以想象的主题的书籍。这个地方也是迪米尔人的交流中心之一。秘密信息通过各种魔法和世俗的方法被隐藏在书中。例如，迪米尔特工可能不得不收集隐藏在几个不同文件中的信息碎片，以找到他们的下一个任务或目标。复杂的代码和魔法防护装置保护着其他秘密。",
	"Specialty items that are commonly used by scribes, researchers, and inventors can be found in many small shops in the precinct, usually run by a tinker or academic. Precinct Five also has the best apothecaries, alchemists, and magic-mongers in the Tenth District. On the other hand, mundane adventuring gear, weapons, and armor are harder to find.": "文士、研究人员和发明家常用的特殊物品可以在辖区内的许多小商店找到，这些商店通常由工匠或学者经营。第五区还拥有第十区最好的药剂师、炼金术师和魔法师。另一方面，普通的冒险装备、武器和盔甲比较难找。",

	"Much of the crime in Precinct Five is of a sort that is hard to detect: blackmail, espionage, identity theft (of the literal kind, perpetrated by shapechangers), and the like. Most of the precinct's residents spend their time absorbed in study, unaware that such activities might be happening under their noses. Only rarely does violence break out, and Azorius arresters try hard to keep the incident quiet and maintain public calm.": "第五区的大部分犯罪都是难以察觉的：勒索、间谍活动、身份盗窃（字面意思是由变形金刚实施的）等等。辖区内的大多数居民把时间花在学习上，没有意识到这种活动可能发生在他们的眼皮底下。只有在极少数情况下才会发生暴力事件，阿佐里乌斯的逮捕人员会努力保持事件的安静，并保持公众的冷静。",

	"Large warehouses, major thoroughfares, and nondescript worker tenements make the utilitarian Precinct Six a hub of activity for shipping, storage, and other mercantile concerns in the Tenth District. Wide cobblestone streets allow for the passage of beasts and constructs that transport raw goods from points beyond the Tenth and for the shipping of manufactured materials back to those locations. The demands of commerce keep the area constantly active, and the inconspicuous nature of the warehouses makes them popular as rendezvous points for all sorts of transactions, legal and illicit. At night, lurking undead and the horrors of the undercity, coming up from Deadbridge Chasm, keep wary citizens indoors, while a few people who deal in sinister magic seek the monsters out for nefarious purposes.": "大型仓库、主要干道和不显眼的工人公寓，使功利的第六区成为第十区航运、仓储和其他商业活动的中心。宽阔的鹅卵石街道允许野兽和建筑通过，从第十区以外的地方运输原材料，并将制成品运回这些地方。商业需求使该地区持续活跃，而仓库的不显眼性质使其成为各种合法和非法交易的集合点，很受欢迎。到了晚上，潜伏的亡灵和来自死桥鸿沟的城市地下的恐怖，让警惕的市民们呆在室内，而一些从事邪恶魔法交易的人则为了邪恶的目的寻找这些怪物。",

	"The western part of the precinct, Medori Park, is named after an Orzhov pontiff who converted a city park into a warehouse lot many years ago. This neighborhood is particularly rife with undead at night, both corporeal and incorporeal. Some serve dark masters and often guard valuables, while others pursue their own evil urges. The Orzhov Syndicate owns many large warehouses here, and the Boros Legion maintains facilities to store a variety of equipment used by their soldiers, including valuable weapons and armor. The most important facilities are heavily guarded—often by angels, whether Boros or Orzhov.": "辖区西部的梅多里公园，是以多年前一位将城市公园改造成仓库的奥尔乔夫教皇命名的。这一带在夜间尤其充斥着亡灵，包括有形的和无形的。有些人服务于黑暗的主人，经常看守贵重物品，而其他人则追求自己的邪恶冲动。奥尔佐夫集团在这里拥有许多大型仓库，波罗斯军团也有一些设施来储存他们的士兵使用的各种设备，包括宝贵的武器和盔甲。最重要的设施都有重兵把守--通常是由天使把守，无论是Boros还是Orzhov。",
	"A gaping opening in the ground dominates the precinct and is lined with mossy stairs and fungal blooms. Deadbridge Chasm serves as an entrance to the Golgari's undercity realm and their guildhall, Korozda. The area smells of decomposition, an odor that grows particularly intense on hot days. Many kraul make their homes in the walls that line the cavernous descent, and Devkarin elves come up to the surface through this passage to trade on Tin Street.": "地面上的一个缺口主宰着这个区域，两边是长满苔藓的楼梯和真菌的花朵。死桥鸿沟是通往戈尔加里人的城下之境和他们的行宫科罗兹达的入口。这个区域有腐烂的气味，这种气味在炎热的日子里会变得特别强烈。许多克劳尔人在洞穴下行的墙壁上安家，德夫卡林的精灵们通过这条通道来到地面，在铁皮街进行交易。",
	"The neighborhood of Wayport rises like a pillar from the midst of Deadbridge Chasm, and a number of bridges, large and small, connect it to the surrounding city of multiple vertical levels. Many goods traded with other districts are funneled along Tin Street, often pausing in Wayport's warehouses along the way. But only the wealthiest merchants can afford storage space here.": "Wayport社区像一根柱子一样从死桥鸿沟的中间升起，一些大大小小的桥梁将它与周围的多个垂直层面的城市连接起来。许多与其他地区交易的货物都是沿着铁皮街输送的，沿途经常在Wayport的仓库中停顿。但只有最富有的商人才能负担得起这里的存储空间。",
	"This wide bridge is a main thoroughfare for cargo traveling to and from districts beyond the Tenth. A small market is located here, complete with shops and restaurants, all of which close after dark. Secret pain clubs, hidden below the market in dark rooms inside the bridge itself, come alive after sunset.": "这座宽阔的桥是进出第十区的货物的主要通道。这里有一个小市场，里面有商店和餐馆，所有这些都在天黑后关闭。秘密的疼痛俱乐部，隐藏在市场下面桥内的黑暗房间里，日落之后就会活跃起来。",
	"Trade goods can easily be acquired in Precinct Six, along with manufactured items such as artisan's tools. Weapons, armor, and mounts are rarely on sale here.

	"The folk of Precinct Six are pragmatic, not overly concerned with the welfare of others, and thus often willing to disregard minor crimes.

The typical response time to a reported crime in these areas is {@dice 2d10} minutes, and the squad consists of two Boros {@creature soldier|GGR|soldiers}.

	"Precinct Six is a hotbed for illicit activity, particularly organized crime. Goblin gangs haunt the Smelting Quarter, most notably a large gang that claims Foundry Street, led by a goblin named Krenko. Vicious turf wars sometimes erupt in that area.

Night-lurking monsters are a particular problem in the precinct as well, often attacking and disappearing before help can arrive.": "第六区是非法活动的温床，尤其是有组织犯罪。妖精帮派在冶炼区出没，其中最引人注目的是由一个名叫克伦科的妖精领导的铸造街的大帮派。恶性的地盘争夺战有时会在该地区爆发。暴力犯罪在整个辖区内经常发生，大部分的尸体最后都被扔进了死桥鸿沟。夜间潜伏的怪物也是该地区的一个特殊问题，它们经常在救援人员到达之前袭击并消失。",

	"When the innocent are victimized by the powerful, heroes step in. Criminal shakedowns, military raids, endless riots, and more are chances for characters to prove their mettle and earn the adulation of the populace.": "当无辜者被强者所害时，英雄们就会挺身而出。犯罪分子的洗劫、军事突袭、无休止的骚乱等等，都是人物证明自己能力的机会，并赢得民众的拥护。",
	"Interguild conflict is such a fundamental aspect of life on Ravnica that the player characters' guild membership is an easy starting point for choosing an adventure villain. If you choose a villain from a guild that's already in conflict with one or more guilds that the characters belong to, it's easy to craft villainous goals that are at odds with the characters' goals.": "公会间的冲突是拉夫尼卡生活的一个基本方面，所以玩家角色的公会成员身份是选择冒险反派的一个简单起点。如果你从一个已经与角色所属的一个或多个公会发生冲突的公会中选择一个反派，就很容易制定出与角色目标相悖的反派目标。",
	"If all the player characters belong to a single guild, choosing almost any other guild will provide opportunities for conflict. The natural state of the relationship between any two guilds is tension at best, and open warfare at worst. All it takes is a villain willing to upset the balance of power, and the characters' guild or their own motivations should easily bring them into conflict with the villain. A party's own guild could even provide a villain, given the amount of scheming and intrigue that exists even within the guilds. A guild official gone rogue, members of the same guild at odds with one another, or even a corrupt guildmaster can put characters in conflict with their own guild.": "如果所有的玩家角色都属于一个单一的公会，选择几乎任何其他的公会都会提供冲突的机会。任何两个行会之间关系的自然状态最好是紧张，最坏是公开战争。只需要一个愿意打破权力平衡的反派，人物的公会或他们自己的动机就会很容易使他们与反派发生冲突。考虑到即使在行会内部也存在大量的阴谋诡计，一方自己的行会甚至可以提供一个反派。叛变的行会官员、同一行会的成员彼此不和，甚至是腐败的行会会长，都可以使角色与自己的行会发生冲突。",
	"If the characters come from different guilds, a common enemy provides a good reason for them to work together. Any guild that isn't represented by one of the characters is a fine choice for a villain.": "如果角色来自不同的公会，共同的敌人为他们提供了一个很好的理由来合作。任何不是由其中一个角色代表的行会都是一个很好的反派选择。",
	"Once you've chosen an adventure seed—a villain, a mission, or a general hook—you need to figure out what gets the player characters involved in the adventure. The answer could be as simple as a guildmaster or other authority sending them on a mission, but it's generally good to hook the characters in personally. What motivation do they have to thwart the villain?": "一旦你选择了一个冒险的种子--一个反派，一个任务，或者一个一般的钩子--你就需要想出是什么让玩家角色参与到这个冒险中来。答案可能很简单，就是一个公会会长或其他权威人士派他们去执行任务，但一般来说，让角色亲自参与进来是很好的。他们有什么动机来挫败坏蛋？",
	"The best answers to this question stem either from the adventurers' personalities, ideals, and histories, or from their guild affiliations. The characters might have a common reason to fight the villain (especially if they all belong to the same guild or have been adventuring together for a while), or they might all oppose the villain for different reasons.": "这个问题的最佳答案要么来自冒险者的个性、理想和历史，要么来自他们的公会关系。这些角色可能有一个共同的理由来对抗恶棍（特别是如果他们都属于同一个公会或者已经一起冒险了一段时间），或者他们都可能因为不同的原因而反对恶棍。",
	"For example, say your villain is a group of Gruul anarchs raiding in a densely populated area. A Boros character might be assigned to protect innocent bystanders, or might just happen to be in the area and leap to the defense of the innocents. An Izzet character might be trying to make sure that an Izzet laboratory in the area isn't damaged or its secrets looted. A Dimir spy might leap at the opportunity to steal some Izzet secrets when the laboratory comes under attack.": "例如，假设你的反派是一群格鲁尔无政府主义者，他们在人口稠密的地区进行袭击。一个Boros角色可能被指派去保护无辜的旁观者，或者刚好在该地区，并跃跃欲试地去保护无辜者。一个Izzet角色可能会试图确保该地区的Izzet实验室不被破坏或其秘密被掠夺。当实验室受到攻击时，一个迪米尔间谍可能会抓住机会偷取一些伊泽特人的秘密。",
	"The Cross Purposes table can help you involve the characters in an adventure by suggesting ways that a villain's activities might directly conflict with the player characters' goals or interests.": "交叉目的表可以帮助你让角色参与到冒险中来，它可以建议一个反派的活动可能与玩家角色的目标或利益直接冲突。",
	"... directly target one or more characters. The adventure begins when characters are attacked by the villain's agents.": "...直接针对一个或多个角色。当人物被反派的代理人攻击时，冒险就开始了。",
	"... threaten a character's contact or bond.": "......威胁到一个角色的联系或纽带。",

	"An adventure that pits player characters against a single guild is relatively straightforward, but adding another guild can make an adventure even more interesting.": "让玩家角色与单一行会对抗的冒险相对简单，但加入另一个行会可以使冒险更加有趣。",
	"The involvement of a second guild can be as simple as the appearance of a bumbling innocent who needs the characters' protection, or as complex as a second villain who pursues an entirely separate scheme. The Secondary Guild Role table presents a range of options.": "第二行会的参与可以简单到出现一个需要人物保护的笨拙的无辜者，也可以复杂到出现一个追求完全独立的计划的第二个反派。第二行会角色表提供了一系列的选择。",
	"A rival pursues the same goal as the adventurers, but is doing it \"wrong.\"": "一个对手追求与冒险家相同的目标，但却做得 \"不对\"。",
	"One or more members of another guild are caught between the villain and the adventurers.": "另一个行会的一个或多个成员被夹在恶棍和冒险者之间。",
	"A group of NPC adventurers from another guild confront the same villain for different reasons.": "一群来自另一个行会的NPC冒险家因不同的原因对抗同一个恶棍。",
	"Someone is manipulating the villain for their own purposes.": "有人为了自己的目的操纵小人。",

	"A known rival or enemy can provide essential help in stopping the villain.": "一个已知的对手或敌人可以为阻止恶棍提供必要的帮助。",
	"A second villain's plot is unfolding at the same time but is otherwise unrelated.": "第二个反派的阴谋也在同时展开，但在其他方面没有关系。",
	"A second villain is in competition with the first one.": "第二个恶棍与第一个恶棍竞争。",
	"Intrigue in Ravnica most often involves interaction between two guilds, so you can use the Guild Intrigue table to find the nugget of a plot. The villain tables in the guild entries can help you determine the nature and motivations of the individuals involved.": "拉夫尼卡的阴谋活动最常涉及两个公会之间的互动，因此你可以使用公会阴谋表来找到阴谋的小块。公会条目中的反派表可以帮助你确定相关人员的性质和动机。",

	"Splinter factions from two guilds are trying to form a new guild.": "两个行会的分裂派别正试图组建一个新的行会。",
	"A friendly contact can act as a patron, sending a character on a mission or a side quest either as a formal assignment or as a favor. Friendly contacts also have a knack for getting into perilous situations from which they need to be rescued, which can sometimes force characters into making difficult choices between saving friendly nonplayer characters and capturing villainous ones. In extraordinary circumstances, a friendly contact might even join the adventuring party for a short time.": "友好的联络人可以作为赞助人，将一个角色送去执行任务或副线任务，作为一项正式的任务或一个人情。友好的联络人也有陷入危险境地的诀窍，他们需要被救出来，这有时会迫使角色在拯救友好的非玩家角色和抓捕反派角色之间做出艰难的选择。在特殊情况下，友好的联络人甚至可能短时间内加入冒险党。",
	"Contacts who have a more antagonistic relationship with a character can hinder the adventuring party's efforts in a variety of ways. They might appear at inconvenient times to delay the party, or catch the group in the midst of some illegal activity. They might leak information to the adventure's villain, subtly aid the villain's efforts, or even become villains themselves.": "与角色有更多敌对关系的联系人可以以各种方式阻碍冒险党的努力。他们可能会在不方便的时候出现，拖延队伍，或者在一些非法活动中抓住队伍。他们可能会向冒险的恶棍泄露信息，巧妙地帮助恶棍的工作，甚至自己成为恶棍。",
	"Contacts can complicate things even more when they interact with multiple player characters or with each other. Consider what might happen when two people who are friendly contacts for two different characters are bitter enemies of each other, or when a single NPC is a good friend of one character and a rival of another. The characters might have to navigate those complex relationships in order to achieve their goals.": "当联系人与多个玩家角色或相互之间发生互动时，事情会变得更加复杂。考虑一下当两个不同角色的友好联系人是彼此的死敌，或者当一个NPC是一个角色的好朋友和另一个角色的对手时，可能会发生什么。为了实现他们的目标，角色们可能不得不驾驭这些复杂的关系。",
	"Any time you need an NPC for an adventure—for example, if the player characters are sent on a mission to rescue a member of their guild—you can use the contacts tables in {@book chapter 2|GGR|2} to help flesh out the NPC. If you don't know the NPC's guild affiliation, you can roll on the Random Guilds table in this book's introduction to determine the guild. Then you can choose an appropriate stat block to represent the NPC's game statistics.": "任何时候你都需要一个NPC来进行冒险--例如，如果玩家角色被派去执行拯救他们公会成员的任务--你可以使用{@book chapter 2|GGR|2}中的联系表来帮助充实NPC。如果你不知道NPC的公会归属，你可以在本书介绍中的随机公会表上进行滚动，以确定该公会。然后，你可以选择一个适当的数据块来代表NPC的游戏统计数据。",
	"Adventures involving the Azorius Senate naturally revolve around law enforcement.

	"The Golgari possess a combination of ambition and ruthlessness that makes them extremely dangerous adversaries. The tension among the various factions of the swarm (the elves, the medusas, the kraul, and the rising erstwhile) adds an element of instability to the mix. But perhaps the Golgari Swarm's most dangerous quality is the widespread confidence among its members that it will survive any catastrophe that might befall the surface world. This certainty means Golgari villains will stop at nothing in an attempt to provoke such an event—triggering a virulent plague, causing explosive plant growth, or inciting the other guilds into open war, for example. Over the course of a campaign, a group of adventurers might foil Golgari plans to accomplish all these things, or the characters might be constantly struggling against one ongoing disaster.": "戈尔加里人拥有一种野心和无情的结合，这使他们成为极其危险的对手。虫群中各派系（精灵族、梅杜莎族、克劳尔族和正在崛起的厄斯泰尔族）之间的紧张关系为这个组合增添了不稳定因素。但戈尔加里虫群最危险的品质也许是其成员中普遍存在的信心，即它将在任何可能降临到地表世界的灾难中幸存下来。这种确定性意味着戈尔加里的恶棍们会不惜一切代价来挑起这样的事件--例如，引发一场剧烈的瘟疫，导致植物爆炸性生长，或者煽动其他公会进行公开战争。在一场战役的过程中，一群冒险者可能会挫败戈尔加里的计划，完成所有这些事情，或者角色们可能会不断地与一场正在进行的灾难作斗争。",
	"For example, the characters might spend the early part of the campaign resolving disputes between guilds, unaware that the Golgari are actually the instigators of those conflicts. Perhaps incidental to these missions, they also face a spore druid who is in the early stages of testing a terrible plague. Then, as the campaign reaches higher levels, the plague breaks out again, this time spreading rapidly. The crisis heightens tensions among the other guilds, especially when food sources are threatened. At the climax of the campaign, the heroes must defuse conflict among the guilds while finding a way to get at the druid at the cause of it all, who is locked in an undercity mansion waiting out the catastrophe.": "例如，角色们可能会在战役的早期阶段解决行会之间的争端，却不知道戈尔加里人实际上是这些冲突的煽动者。也许在这些任务中，他们还面临着一个孢子德鲁伊，他正处于试验一种可怕瘟疫的早期阶段。然后，随着战役达到更高的水平，瘟疫再次爆发，这一次迅速蔓延。这场危机加剧了其他公会之间的紧张关系，特别是当食物来源受到威胁时。在战役的高潮部分，英雄们必须化解公会之间的冲突，同时找到一种方法来对付造成这一切的德鲁伊，他被锁在城市地下的豪宅中等待灾难的到来。",
	"Characters who are members of the Golgari Swarm might be sent on missions into the undercity, particularly jobs that involve retrieval or salvage. The secretive agents of the Ochran are more likely to pursue goals that call for theft or even assassination, while shamans could participate in the swarm's work of \"reclamation\" in surface neighborhoods. The Golgari Assignments table reflects this range of possibilities. An assignment can also serve as a side quest for Golgari adventurers to undertake while pursuing a larger goal with a mixed-guild party.": "作为戈尔加里蜂群的成员，他们可能会被派往城市地下执行任务，特别是涉及回收或打捞的工作。奥克兰的秘密特工更有可能追求偷窃甚至暗杀的目标，而巫师们则可以参与虫群在地面社区的 \"开垦 \"工作。戈尔加里任务表反映了这一系列的可能性。一个任务也可以作为戈尔加里冒险家的副业，在与混合公会一起追求一个更大的目标时进行。",

Eventually, their strategy evolves toward extortion and conquest, as they unleash wurms and similar powerful beasts to threaten those who refuse to convert, and they use the might of their armies to eliminate other guilds and bring whole precincts under their control.
