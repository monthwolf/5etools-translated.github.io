Though he began his career determined to use magic to dominate and control others, he eventually changed his ways and has worked hard to make amends for his past villainy. One factor that influenced his change of heart was Bigby's recurring encounters with Diancastra, a demigod revered by many giants.

	"Dear reader,": "亲爱的读者，",
	"This book represents a journey for me, and I am excited to take your hand and lead you along the same path. I never had much interest in giants, though I certainly respected their strength. My various encounters with Diancastra—who is no less than a daughter of Annam, the All-Father of the giants!—opened my eyes to the glories, the deep magic, and the wisdom of these ancient people.": "这本书对我来说代表着一次旅程，我很兴奋地牵着你的手，带你沿着同样的道路前行。我从未对巨人产生过太大兴趣，尽管我当然尊重他们的力量。我与(Diancastra)的各种相遇——她不仅是巨人之父安南(Annam)的女儿！——让我看到了这些古老民族的荣耀、深奥的魔法和智慧。",
	"I've asked Diancastra to review this text, and her notes appear throughout the book where her perspective can enlarge upon my own. I trust that her insight and my erudition will expand your horizons as she has broadened mine.": "我已请(Diancastra)审阅此文，她的评论会在整本书中出现，从她的角度来看会对我的观点进行扩展。我相信她的洞察力和我的博学将会拓展你的视野，就像她拓宽了我的视野一样。",
	"The saga of the demigod Diancastra is an epic poem treasured by skalds and storytellers among all kinds of giants. The portion of the saga excerpted at the start of this book is among its most popular scenes, describing how Diancastra convinced her father to imbue her with divinity even though her mother was a mortal giant.": "半神戴安卡斯特拉(Diancastra)的传奇故事是一首史诗诗歌，受到各种巨人中的诗人和讲故事者的珍视。本书开头摘录的故事片段是其中最受欢迎的场景之一，描述了戴安卡斯特拉是如何说服她的父亲赋予她神力的，尽管她的母亲是一个凡人巨人。",
	"The story is unusual among the sagas of the giants in its description of Annam's deeds \"in time's dawning.\" It boldly claims Annam collected the fragments of the First World—the original world of the Material Plane, created by the primordial dragons Bahamut and Tiamat—and contributed in some way to their transformation into the Material Plane as it exists today with its myriad worlds. Other sagas claim Annam was similarly instrumental in the creation of the Inner Planes, slowly sorting the tumult of the Elemental Chaos until the four Elemental Planes took shape. These sagas explain the giants' close ties to the elemental forces of air, earth, fire, and water by pointing to Annam's early efforts in the Elemental Planes.": "这个故事在巨人传说中是独特的，因为它描述了安南在“时光初现”时的事迹。它大胆地声称安南收集了第一个世界的碎片——原初物质位面的原始世界，由原始龙巴哈姆特和提阿玛特创造——并以某种方式促成了它们转变为如今存在的物质位面，拥有无数世界。其他传说声称安南在内部位面的创造中也发挥了类似的作用，他慢慢地整理元素混沌，直到四大元素位面形成。这些传说解释了巨人与空气、土地、火焰和水的元素力量之间的密切联系，指出安南在元素位面的早期努力。",
	"{@i Diancastra's Saga} also summarizes the central tragedy of giantkind's long history: Annam intended the giants to rule over all the worlds of the Material Plane, but his six sons—the gods Stronmaus, Memnor, Surtur, Thrym, Skoraeus, and Grolantor—failed to live up to their father's expectations for them. (Diancastra calls her brothers \"boorish and bumbling.\" Notably, Annam does not refute her on that point.) Annam's disappointment in his sons caused him to retreat to a hidden realm within the Outlands, far removed from the Material Plane and the domains of other gods.": "{@i Diancastra's Saga} 也总结了巨人种族漫长历史中的核心悲剧：安南（Annam）本意是让巨人统治物质位面的所有世界，但他的六个儿子——诸神斯特隆莫斯（Stronmaus）、梅姆诺（Memnor）、苏尔图尔（Surtur）、瑟林姆（Thrym）、斯科雷乌斯（Skoraeus）和格罗兰托（Grolantor）——未能达到他们父亲对他们的期望。（迪安卡斯特拉（Diancastra）称她的兄弟们为“粗鲁而笨拙”。值得注意的是，安南并没有反驳她的说法。）安南对儿子们的失望导致他撤退到了外域中的一个隐秘领域，远离了物质位面和其他神祇的领域。",
	"A key moment in {@i Diancastra's Saga} is Annam's challenge to his daughter. He dismisses her deeds as \"pranks and rebellion\" and defies Diancastra to bring him \"pure perfection,\" some item that for all his craft and skill he is unable to improve. He clearly intends this to be an impossible task.": "{@i Diancastra's Saga}中的关键时刻是Annam向他的女儿发出挑战。他将她的行为称为\"恶作剧和叛逆\"，并挑战Diancastra给他带来\"纯粹的完美\"，这是他无论如何都无法改进的物品。他显然打算让这成为一个不可能完成的任务。",
	"But Diancastra surprises him. Journeying to the outermost reaches of the Elemental Chaos, where unshaped elements form a tumult of matter and energy, she claims a mote of raw chaos and brings it to her father. Annam quickly shapes it, but he is unsatisfied with the result; he shapes it again and again, but—as Diancastra points out—each of his efforts to craft something from the chaos ends up reducing its raw potential into mere actuality.": "但是迪安卡斯特拉(Diancastra)让他大吃一惊。前往元素混沌的最外围，那里未成形的元素形成了一团物质和能量的骚动，她取得了一点原始混沌并带给了她的父亲。安南(Annam)迅速塑造了它，但他对结果不满意；他一次又一次地塑造它，但正如迪安卡斯特拉指出的那样，他每次努力从混沌中塑造出某物，最终都会将其原始潜力降低为单纯的现实。",
	"The saga makes a point that concerns more than Diancastra's cleverness. In granting his daughter's request for divinity, Annam acknowledges that the same chaotic, changeable potential exists within his sons and their descendants. Ultimately, this acknowledgment holds out the possibility that Annam's faith in his descendants might be restored and the All-Father might one day be drawn from his self-imposed exile. That glimmer of hope, faint as it might be, is a significant motivation for those giants who hope to reclaim their people's ancient glory, and it might account for the saga's popularity among giants of all kinds.": "这个传说强调的不仅仅是迪安卡斯特拉的聪明才智。在答应女儿成为神灵的请求时，安南承认他的儿子及后代们也存在着同样混乱、多变的潜力。最终，这种承认为安南对后代的信任可能会恢复以及全能之父有朝一日可能会摆脱自我放逐提供了可能性。即使这一丝希望微弱，但对那些希望重振他们民族古老荣耀的巨人来说，这是一个重要的动力，也许这也解释了为什么这个传说在各种巨人中如此受欢迎。",
	"A good saga, well-told, reveals a great deal about the teller. If you're lucky and self-aware, it can also show you something about yourself. Only rarely does it tell you much worth knowing about its subject among its alliteration and kennings and such. That said, Bigby presented me with several versions of my saga, and I insisted he use this one. The interpretation he presents here is a reasonable one.": "一个好的传奇故事，讲述得当，能够揭示讲述者的很多信息。如果你幸运且自知之明，它也能让你了解自己的一些东西。在所有的头韵和隐喻中，很少有传说能告诉你关于它的主题值得知道的东西。话虽如此，Bigby给我展示了几个版本的我的传奇故事，我坚持让他使用这个版本。他在这里呈现的解释是合理的。",
	"The descendants of Annam are the various creatures of the Giant creature type. The precise details of genealogy linking Annam to these Giants are a matter of mythology, and myths vary from world to world and from one teller to another. Most tellings make a distinction between the main families of giants who are descended from the sons of Annam and the various other creatures whose origins are murkier.": "安南的后代是各种巨人生物。关于安南与这些巨人之间的家族谱系细节，是神话传说的内容，神话在世界之间、讲述者之间都有所不同。大多数传说都区分了那些是从安南的儿子后代而来的主要巨人家族，以及那些起源更加模糊的其他各种生物。",
	"As described in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, the ordning ranks the six main families of giants. Each family's place in the ordning corresponds to the birth order of the associated son of Annam: Stronmaus, Annam's firstborn, is regarded as the progenitor of storm giants, and Grolantor, progenitor of hill giants, is Annam's youngest son. Thus, the ordning neatly encompasses and arranges {@creature Storm Giant||storm giants}, {@creature Cloud Giant||cloud giants}, {@creature Fire Giant||fire giants}, {@creature Frost Giant||frost giants}, {@creature Stone Giant||stone giants}, and {@creature Hill Giant||hill giants} by connecting them to Stronmaus, Memnor, Surtur, Thrym, Skoraeus, and Grolantor, respectively.": "正如{@book Monster Manual|MM}中所描述的那样，奥德宁将巨人的六大主要家族进行了排名。每个家族在奥德宁中的位置与与安南之子的出生顺序相对应：作为风巨人的始祖，安南的长子Stronmaus被认为是风暴巨人的始祖，而山岳巨人的始祖Grolantor则是安南的幼子。因此，奥德宁通过将它们与Stronmaus、Memnor、Surtur、Thrym、Skoraeus和Grolantor连接起来，整齐地包含和排列了{@creature Storm Giant||storm giants}、{@creature Cloud Giant||cloud giants}、{@creature Fire Giant||fire giants}、{@creature Frost Giant||frost giants}、{@creature Stone Giant||stone giants}和{@creature Hill Giant||hill giants}。",
	"That neat structure overlooks the daughters of Annam: Hiatea, Iallanis, and Diancastra. Indeed, these goddesses and their worshipers often push against the boundaries of the ordning, both within each kind of giant and in the overall rankings of the giant families. No giants count the goddesses as ancestors, but that helps ensure their popularity extends across giantkind.": "那座整洁的建筑物俯瞰着(`Annam`)安南的女儿们：海亚提亚(Hiatea)、伊阿拉尼斯(Iallanis)和迪安卡斯特拉(Diancastra)。事实上，这些女神及其信徒经常挑战(`ordning`)的界限，无论是在各类巨人内部还是在整个巨人家族的排名中。没有巨人将这些女神视为祖先，但这有助于确保她们的受欢迎程度跨越了整个巨人族群。",
	"The structure of the ordning also overlooks the {@creature Fomorian||fomorians} and their progenitor, Karontor, who is usually described as Grolantor's older twin. Just as Annam banished Karontor from the family of the gods for his part in inciting the fomorians to assault the Feywild, the All-Father also excluded the fomorians from the ordning.": "{@creature Fomorian||fomorians}的结构也忽略了他们的祖先卡隆托（Karontor），他通常被描述为格罗兰托（Grolantor）的长兄。正如安南（Annam）因为他煽动弗莫里安（fomorians）进攻精灵界而将卡隆托放逐出神族家族一样，全能之父也将弗莫里安排除在等级制度之外。",
	"Once cloud giants, death giants (introduced in {@book chapter 6|BGG|6|Death Giants} of this book) technically have the same rank in the ordning as the other descendants of Memnor. However, by turning away from the gods of their ancestors to serve the Raven Queen, they have abdicated their place in the ordning.": "曾经是云巨人，死亡巨人（在本书的{@book chapter 6|BGG|6|Death Giants}中介绍）在奥德宁中技术上与梅姆诺的其他后裔拥有相同的地位。然而，通过背弃祖先的神灵而侍奉乌鸦女王，他们已经放弃了在奥德宁中的地位。",
	"The Many Meanings of \"Giant\"": "“巨人”这个词的多重含义",
	"The word \"giant\" has multiple meanings in English and in the rules of D&D, opening the possibility of some confusion.": "在英语中，“giant”一词有多重含义，在D&D（龙与地下城）规则中也是如此，这可能会导致一些混淆。",
	"As a rule, when this book talks about \"giants,\" it refers to the various creatures that include \"giant\" in their name—specifically, the giants found in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}—{@creature Cloud Giant||cloud giants}, {@creature Fire Giant||fire giants}, {@creature Frost Giant||frost giants}, {@creature Hill Giant||hill giants}, {@creature Stone Giant||stone giants}, and {@creature Storm Giant||storm giants}—as well as the death giants that appear in {@book chapter 6|BGG|6|Death Giants} of this book. These giants are the focus of this book, so it's safe to assume that's what is meant when you see the word \"giant\" and it's not capitalized or otherwise qualified.": "作为一个规则，当这本书谈到“巨人”时，它指的是各种生物，包括名字中带有“巨人”的生物，具体来说，是在{@book Monster Manual|MM}—{@creature Cloud Giant||cloud giants}、{@creature Fire Giant||fire giants}、{@creature Frost Giant||frost giants}、{@creature Hill Giant||hill giants}、{@creature Stone Giant||stone giants}和{@creature Storm Giant||storm giants}中发现的巨人，以及在本书的{@book chapter 6|BGG|6|Death Giants}中出现的死亡巨人。这些巨人是本书的重点，所以当你看到“巨人”这个词时，如果没有大写或其他修饰，可以安全地假设它指的就是这些巨人。",
	"\"Giant\" is also a creature type in the D&D rules, and as such, it's capitalized whenever it's used. This book usually refers to \"creatures of the Giant type\" to make sure it's very clear what is being talked about. All the giants are creatures of the Giant type, as are {@creature Cyclops||cyclopes}, {@creature Ettin||ettins}, {@creature Fomorian||fomorians}, {@creature Ogre||ogres}, and {@creature Troll||trolls}. But that latter group of creatures is not the focus of this book.": "“巨人”也是D&D规则中的一种生物类型，因此每次使用时都要大写。本书通常会提到“巨人类型的生物”，以确保清楚指出正在讨论的内容。所有的巨人都是巨人类型的生物，包括{@creature Cyclops||cyclopes}、{@creature Ettin||ettins}、{@creature Fomorian||fomorians}、{@creature Ogre||ogres}和{@creature Troll||trolls}。但这组后者并不是本书的重点。",
	"\"Giant\" (capitalized) is also the name of the language spoken by most creatures of the Giant type (as well as a few other creatures, such as hags). References to the language throughout this book typically refer to \"the Giant language\" or \"Giant runes,\" so there should be no confusion between the language and the creature type.": "“巨人”（大写）也是大多数巨人类型生物（以及一些其他生物，如女巫）所说的语言的名称。本书中对这种语言的引用通常指的是“巨人语”或“巨人符文”，因此不应混淆语言和生物类型。",
	"The other creatures of the Giant type, who are not included in the category of \"giants,\" are connected to Annam but not descended from him.": "巨人类型的其他生物，不属于“巨人”类别，与安南有关但并非他的后裔。",
	"The monstrous god Vaprak is connected to Annam in some myths, though he is never regarded as a proper son of Annam. The Dwarvish Saga of Gnarldan Steelshield describes how Vaprak arose from Annam's blood when it was spilled on one of the worlds he tended, and the {@creature Troll||trolls} in turn arose from Vaprak's blood shed in a similar manner. The fensirs introduced in {@book chapter 6|BGG|6|Fensirs} of this book are descended from trolls. {@creature Ogre||Ogres} are sometimes described as descendants of Vaprak, giving them a distant and distorted connection to Annam. {@creature Oni} are often said to be distantly related to ogres, but at this point they are more fiendish than Giant.": "庞大的神祇瓦普拉克与安南在一些神话中有联系，尽管他从未被视为安南的合法儿子。矮人传奇《纳尔丹·钢盾之歌》描述了瓦普拉克是如何从安南的血液中诞生的，当安南的血液洒落在他照料的世界之一时，瓦普拉克便诞生了，而{@creature Troll||trolls}则是从瓦普拉克以类似方式流出的血液中诞生的。本书中介绍的芬西尔族源自巨魔。{@book chapter 6|BGG|6|Fensirs}有时被描述为瓦普拉克的后裔，使他们与安南有着遥远而扭曲的联系。{@creature Ogre||Ogres}经常被说成是远房与食人魔有关，但在这一点上，他们更像是邪恶生物而非巨人。",
	"Contradictory legends explain the origin of {@creature Cyclops||cyclopes}, and none of those legends are told by cyclopes themselves (who generally display little interest in the question of their origins and their connection to the gods). Some myths lump them in with ogres as descendants of Vaprak, while others claim they were once ogres who joined the ancient fomorians' invasion of the Feywild and thus shared in fomorians' banishment to the Underdark and the resulting corruption of their physical forms. One myth suggests cyclopes are descendants of Karontor like the fomorians, but stemming from a line that began after Karontor's banishment rather than before it.": "矛盾的传说解释了{@creature Cyclops||cyclopes}的起源，而这些传说中没有一种是由独眼巨人自己讲述的（他们通常对自己的起源以及与众神的联系不太感兴趣）。一些神话将他们与食人魔一起归为瓦普拉克的后代，而另一些声称他们曾经是食人魔，加入了古代福摩尔人入侵仙境的行列，因此分享了福摩尔人被放逐到地底世界以及由此导致他们身体形态腐化的命运。一个神话暗示独眼巨人是卡隆托的后代，就像福摩尔人一样，但是源自于卡隆托被放逐之后的一支，而不是之前。",
	"A widespread folktale suggests {@creature Ettin||ettins} were once orcs who were transformed into their giant-like form by a blessing of the demon lord Demogorgon. If that were true, though, ettins would have no connection to Annam and couldn't be considered kin of the giants. Most giants acknowledge ettins as distant relatives and consider them descendants of Grolantor (and thus distant cousins of hill giants) or of hill giants who were transformed by Demogorgon.": "一则广为流传的民间传说暗示{@creature Ettin||ettins}曾经是兽人，通过恶魔领主德莫戈根的祝福转变成了他们巨人般的形态。然而，如果这是真的，那么双头巨人就与安南没有任何联系，也不能被视为巨人的亲属。大多数巨人承认双头巨人是远房亲戚，认为他们是格罗兰托（因此是山岭巨人的远房表亲）的后代，或者是被德莫戈根转变的山岭巨人的后代。",
	"In addition to all these creatures classed as Giants, two Humanoid kinds also claim distant kinship to Annam's heirs. {@book Goliaths|BGG|6|Goliath Giant-Kin} and {@book firbolgs|BGG|6|Firbolgs} appear in {@book chapter 6|BGG|6} of this book and also appear as character races in {@book Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}. Their connection to Annam is undoubtedly distant, but some individuals among both peoples hold giants in high regard and even worship the divine children of Annam—especially his daughters.": "除了所有这些被归类为巨人的生物外，还有两种人形种族声称与安南的后裔有着遥远的亲缘关系。{@book Goliaths|BGG|6|Goliath Giant-Kin} 和 {@book firbolgs|BGG|6|Firbolgs} 出现在本书的 {@book chapter 6|BGG|6} 部分，并且作为角色种族出现在 {@book Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM} 中。他们与安南的联系无疑是遥远的，但在这两个种族中，一些个体对巨人持有崇高的看法，甚至崇拜安南的神圣子女，尤其是他的女儿。",
	"The saga of Diancastra hints that giants' presence throughout myriad worlds of the Material Plane might be attributable to Annam's role in the shaping of those worlds. Giants believe they were meant to rule the worlds of the Material Plane, and on many worlds, historical records show they once did. But their glory days are in the inconceivably ancient past, long before any smaller folk ever dreamed of writing histories.": "《迪安卡斯特拉(Diancastra)传说》暗示，物质位面无数世界中巨人的存在可能要归因于安南(Annam)在塑造这些世界中的角色。巨人相信他们注定要统治物质位面的世界，在许多世界上，历史记录显示他们曾经这样做过。但他们的辉煌日子已经是在无法想象的遥远过去，早在任何较小的种族梦想写历史之前。",
	"The origins of the giants on the world of Toril lie far in the past, long before any Humanoid peoples proliferated. According to the giants' sagas, Annam fathered the first giants and guided his sons in establishing an empire called Ostoria. In the sagas, this age is called the Time of Giants.": "在托瑞尔世界上，巨人的起源可以追溯到很久以前，早在任何类人种族繁衍之前。根据巨人的传说，安南（Annam）是第一批巨人的父亲，并指导他的儿子建立了一个名为奥斯托利亚（Ostoria）的帝国。在传说中，这个时代被称为巨人时代。",
	"The age is also called the Time of Dragons, because dragons arose and flourished in the same period. Some say the giants were able to build Ostoria only because conflict among the dragons left power vacuums the giants filled.": "这个时代也被称为龙之时代，因为龙在同一时期出现并繁荣起来。有人说巨人之所以能够建造奥斯托利亚，是因为龙之间的冲突造成了权力真空，而巨人填补了这个空缺。",
	"After four millennia of coexistence and intermittent conflict, a mighty red dragon named Garyx—sometimes seen as a god among dragons—goaded the dragons into war with the giants of Ostoria. The conflict is remembered as the Thousand-Year War, though it almost certainly involved long periods of quiet interrupted by battles of intense savagery and widespread destruction. By the end of this conflict, Ostoria was reduced to a shadow of its former glory—and Annam turned his back on his descendants in disappointment.": "经过四千年的共存和间歇性冲突，一只名为Garyx的强大红龙——有时被视为龙中之神——煽动龙族与Ostoria的巨人开战。这场冲突被称为千年战争，尽管几乎肯定包括了长时间的宁静时期，被激烈野蛮和广泛破坏的战斗所打断。在这场冲突结束时，Ostoria已经沦为其昔日辉煌的一影子，Annam失望地背弃了他的后代。",
	"For nearly thirty thousand years since the fall of Ostoria, giants have largely lived in seclusion, keeping as far as possible from the spread of smaller peoples' settlements. From time to time, giants lent their strength to conflicts among other folk. Charismatic giants occasionally forged short-lived kingdoms in ultimately futile efforts to restore the glory of Ostoria, but giants have never again been a driving force in the history of the world as they were during the Dawn Ages.": "自奥斯托利亚（Ostoria）陨落近三万年来，巨人们大多隐居起来，尽可能远离较小种族聚居的蔓延。偶尔，巨人们会借力于其他种族之间的冲突。有魅力的巨人偶尔会建立短暂的王国，试图恢复奥斯托利亚的荣耀，但巨人再也没有像黎明时代那样成为世界历史上的主导力量。",
	"If the giants of Oerth had a mighty empire founded by Annam in the distant past, that fact is not recorded in any of the extant histories of the world. Even so, many giants of Greyhawk revere the sons of Annam, though others have been lured into the service of demon lords or various elder evils.": "如果奥斯（Oerth）的巨人在遥远的过去由安南（Annam）建立了一个强大的帝国，那个事实并没有记录在世界上任何现存的历史中。即便如此，许多格雷鹰（Greyhawk）的巨人尊敬安南的儿子，尽管也有一些被诱入恶魔领主或各种上古邪恶势力的服务中。",
	"During the Age of Dreams, the newly created peoples of Krynn awoke to the first dawn of the world. The first to awaken were a Giant folk known as irda, whose myths claimed they were shaped by the hands of the gods. (Some interpreters of these myths identify the dragon queen Takhisis as their creator, while giant scholars on other worlds believe Annam must have had a part in their creation.) The irda quickly established the first mighty nation of the young world, subjugating humans as their empire grew. The irda ruled for thousands of years, but they fell into decadent cruelty and their empire gradually declined until their human servitors overthrew them.": "在梦境时代期间，克瑞恩(Krynn)新创造的种族在世界的第一个黎明中苏醒。首先苏醒的是被称为伊尔达(irda)的巨人族，他们的神话声称他们是由众神之手塑造而成的。(一些对这些神话的解释者将龙女王塔基西斯(Takhisis)认定为他们的创造者，而其他世界的巨人学者则认为安南(Annam)必定参与了他们的创造。) 伊尔达很快建立了这个年轻世界上第一个强大的国家，随着他们帝国的扩张，他们征服了人类。伊尔达统治了数千年，但他们陷入了颓废的残暴之中，他们的帝国逐渐衰落，直到他们的人类仆从推翻了他们。",
	"From the ashes of a mythic war between angelic and demonic forces that left the primeval world in ruins, an empire of giants was born on the mysterious continent of Xen'drik. The giants dominated Xen'drik for millennia, ruling over many smaller peoples—including elves who chafed under their rule. When the might of the giants began to wane, the elves rebelled. As the giants prepared to use world-shattering magic to smite the elves, the dragons of far-off Argonnessen attacked Xen'drik and brought about the fall of the giants' civilization.": "在天使和恶魔力量之间的神话战争的余烬中，原始世界陷入废墟，一支巨人帝国诞生在神秘大陆Xen'drik上。巨人统治了Xen'drik数千年，统治着许多较小的民族，包括那些不满他们统治的精灵。当巨人的力量开始衰退时，精灵们发动了叛乱。当巨人准备使用毁灭世界的魔法来打击精灵时，远在Argonnessen的龙袭击了Xen'drik，导致了巨人文明的崩溃。",
	"Some giants still live among the ruins of their ancient civilization, though both their numbers and their sophistication are greatly diminished since the fall of their empire. Other giants left Xen'drik and now live alongside smaller peoples. Giants have been known to study in the universities of the Five Nations, to lead bands of marauders in Droaam, and to trade with dwarf miners far beneath the surface of the Mror Holds.": "一些巨人仍然生活在他们古老文明的废墟中，尽管自从他们帝国的崩溃以来，他们的数量和文明程度都大大减少。其他巨人离开了Xen'drik，现在与较小的种族一起生活。巨人已知在五国的大学中学习，在Droaam领导掠夺者团伙，并与Mror Holds地下深处的矮人矿工进行贸易。",
	"The giants of Eberron do not tell legends of Annam the All-Father, nor do they adhere to the rigid structure of the ordning. This might be another example of the effects of Eberron's isolation from the rest of the multiverse, but it is also possible that Annam abandoned his children at the fall of their ancient empire, just as he did on other worlds, and they have since forgotten him entirely.": "Eberron的巨人并不讲述Annam the All-Father的传说，也不遵循ordning的严格结构。这可能是Eberron与多元宇宙其他地方隔绝的影响的另一个例子，但也有可能是Annam在他们古代帝国的覆灭时抛弃了他的子民，就像他在其他世界上所做的那样，而他们已经完全忘记了他。",
	"Giant Runes and Dwarvish Script": "巨型符文和矮人文字 (Giant Runes) (Dwarvish Script)",
	"When Annam created the giants, he also taught them language and gave them runes of power. These symbols are pictographs: each symbol represents a whole word or concept rather than a single letter or sound. Each rune holds latent magical power, much like the glyphs inscribed in magic circles of protection, teleportation circles, and magical traps like the {@spell glyph of warding} spell. Thus, the first giants treated these runes as a sacred secret and rarely wrote them.": "当安南创造了巨人时，他也教会了他们语言，并赐予了他们能量符文。这些符号是象形文字：每个符号代表一个整个单词或概念，而不是单个字母或声音。每个符文都蕴含着潜在的魔法力量，就像刻在保护魔法阵、传送魔法阵和魔法陷阱中的符文一样，比如{@spell glyph of warding}法术。因此，最初的巨人将这些符文视为神圣的秘密，很少书写它们。",
	"It wasn't until long after the first flourishing of the giants' culture that the introduction of the Dwarvish script—an alphabetic set of symbols, where each glyph represents a single sound—made transcribing the Giant language an easier task. To this day, most written forms of the Giant language use the {@book Dwarvish script|PHB|4|Languages} (as described in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}), and the knowledge of Giant runes is rare except among those who study magical writing.": "直到巨人文化第一次蓬勃发展之后，矮人文字的引入——一套字母符号，其中每个字形代表一个单独的音素——使得转录巨人语变得更加容易。直到今天，大多数巨人语的书面形式使用{@book Dwarvish script|PHB|4|Languages}（如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中所述），而巨人符文的知识在除了那些研究魔法文字的人之外是罕见的。",
	"One of my first encounters with giants was also the last thing I did at my old friend (and former foe) Mordenkainen's side. He claims to this day that no cleric was available to restore me to life, only a druid, but he can't hide his smirk when he says it.": "我与巨人的第一次相遇也是我与老朋友（前敌人）莫登凯尼的最后一次相处。他至今声称没有牧师可以让我复活，只有一个德鲁伊，但每次说起这件事时，他都掩饰不住笑意。",
	"Most adventurers have heard tales of giants and their ilk. But for some adventurers, their connection to giants runs deeper than fanciful stories.": "许多冒险者都听说过巨人及其同类的传说。但对于一些冒险者来说，他们与巨人的联系远不止是一些幻想故事。",
	"This chapter is for any D&D character who aspires to forge a link to the mighty giants. From sources of havoc-wreaking power to the artful study of rune magic, from boons that imbue an individual with giant-like might to fantastic tales that can shape an adventurer's entire life—giants can make both big and small impacts on a character's story.": "这一章适用于任何D&D角色，他们渴望与强大的巨人建立联系。从造成混乱破坏的力量源泉到符文魔法的巧妙研究，从赋予个体类似巨人力量的恩赐到能够塑造冒险者整个人生的奇幻故事，巨人可以在角色故事中产生大小不同的影响。",

The {@background rune carver|BGG} background reflects a history of studying the ancient traditions of giants' runecraft.": "本节介绍了两个背景，为角色提供了将其与巨人的古代魔法联系起来的选项。{@background giant foundling|BGG} 背景代表了与巨大生物及其超自然力量共度的生活。{@background rune carver|BGG} 背景反映了研究巨人古代传统符文工艺的历史。",
	"If the DM decides to allow the giant foundling and rune carver backgrounds, all characters in the campaign gain access to a bonus feat.

	"If your spells or class features draw on elemental forces or the magic of the land, you might use a connection to giants to tap into that power. A druid belonging to the {@class Druid||Circle of the Land|Land} might feel a connection to the giants who inhabit that land. A monk who follows the {@class Monk||Way of the Four Elements|Four Elements} might seek to emulate Annam, the All-Father, to shape and channel the forces of the Elemental Chaos.": "如果你的法术或职业特性依赖元素力量或土地魔法，你可以利用与巨人的联系来获取这种力量。属于{@class Druid||Circle of the Land|Land}的德鲁伊可能会感受到与栖息在那片土地上的巨人的联系。一个追随{@class Monk||Way of the Four Elements|Four Elements}的僧侣可能会试图效仿安南，全父，来塑造和引导元素混沌的力量。",
	"You might be distantly descended from giants and manifest the power of your ancestors in your class features or magic, which might explain your Rage as a barbarian or your spellcasting as a sorcerer.": "你可能是巨人的后裔，通过你的职业特性或魔法展现出祖先的力量，这也许可以解释你作为一个野蛮人的愤怒或作为一个巫师的咒术。",
	"Your character's relationship to giants might be defined by animosity. You could choose class features specifically to target giants or all creatures with the Giant type, or you could write enmity toward giants into the tenets of your paladin's Sacred Oath.": "你的角色可能与巨人有敌意的关系。你可以选择特定于攻击巨人或所有巨人类型生物的职业特性，或者你可以将对巨人的敌意写入你圣骑士神圣誓言的准则中。",
	"You might have learned magic, martial techniques, or other secrets from studying giants, either ancient or living. Your character might strive to unearth and record more of the ancient history of giants or to learn more of their present ways. This could be a matter of personal motivation, but it also might explain some of your class features or magic. A bard of the {@class Bard||College of Lore|Lore} might focus on the study of giants, a {@class Fighter||Rune Knight|Rune Knight|TCE} fighter (from {@book Tasha's Cauldron of Everything|TCE}) might use the magic of Giant runes, or a paladin's Sacred Oath could involve allegiance to the tenets of a philosophy or organization of giants (such as those described in {@book chapter 2|BGG|2}).": "你可能通过研究巨人学到了魔法、武术技巧或其他秘密，无论是来自古代还是现代的巨人。你的角色可能努力挖掘并记录更多关于巨人古代历史的信息，或者了解他们现在的生活方式。这可能是出于个人动机，但也可能解释你的一些职业特征或魔法。{@class Bard||College of Lore|Lore}的吟游诗人可能专注于研究巨人，{@book Tasha's Cauldron of Everything|TCE}的{@class Fighter||Rune Knight|Rune Knight|TCE}战士（来自{@book Tasha's Cauldron of Everything|TCE}）可能使用巨人符文的魔法，或者圣武士的神圣誓言可能涉及对巨人哲学或组织的忠诚（比如在{@book chapter 2|BGG|2}中描述的那些）。",
	"You might use a giant-crafted item—probably something inscribed with one or more Giant runes—as a spellcasting focus. For example, the staff you wield as an arcane focus might have been a giant's wand. Your wizard's spellbook might be a relic from an ancient realm of giants, perhaps a large and heavy tome mostly written in the Giant language. Or you might wield a weapon that a giant intended for a different use, such as a giant's letter opener that works as a sword or a giant's hatchet that serves you as a greataxe. Perhaps you have learned to play a giant's violin as if it were a cello or use a musical instrument made for a giant child.": "你可以使用一个巨人制作的物品——可能是一个镌刻有一个或多个巨人符文的东西——作为施法焦点。例如，你作为一个奥术焦点使用的法杖可能是一个巨人的魔杖。你的巫师法术书可能是来自巨人古代领域的遗物，也许是一本大而沉重的书，大部分用巨人语言书写。或者你可能挥舞着一把巨人本来用于其他用途的武器，比如一把巨人的开信刀，可以作为一把剑，或者一把巨人的斧头，对你来说就像一把巨斧。也许你已经学会了演奏一把巨人的小提琴，就好像它是一个大提琴，或者使用一个为巨人孩子制作的乐器。",
	"Your character might worship one of the gods described in {@book chapter 2|BGG|2|Gods and Religion}. If you were reared by giants, they might have taught you their faith. Perhaps one of those gods called you to fulfill a specific purpose. Alternatively, you could worship one of the so-called \"interloper gods\" (also described in {@book chapter 2|BGG|2|Interloper Gods}) who often take an interest in giants, or one of those entities might be your warlock's Otherworldly Patron.": "你的角色可能崇拜{@book chapter 2|BGG|2|Gods and Religion}中描述的某位神祇。如果你是由巨人抚养长大，他们可能教导了你他们的信仰。也许其中一位神祇召唤你来实现特定目的。另外，你也可以崇拜所谓的“干涉者神祇”（也在{@book chapter 2|BGG|2|Interloper Gods}中描述），他们经常对巨人感兴趣，或者其中一位实体可能是你作为术士的异界守护者。",
	"Perhaps you had a giant as a mentor or a financial benefactor who taught you your profession or your class or provided you with your starting equipment. If you have a continuing obligation to this giant, see \"{@book Giant Patrons|BGG|3|Giant Patrons}\" in {@book chapter 3|BGG|3} for additional inspiration.": "也许你有一位巨人作为导师或财务资助者，教导你的职业或职业阶级，或者提供你的起步装备。如果你对这位巨人有持续的义务，请参见{@book chapter 3|BGG|3}中的“{@book Giant Patrons|BGG|3|Giant Patrons}”以获得额外灵感。",
	"You could have a connection with giant-sized or prehistoric animals. You might call on the spirits of cave bears, dire wolves, or eagle-eyed pteranodons, or you might use your magic to take the shapes of such creatures. Or you could have a dinosaur companion.": "你可能与巨大或史前动物有联系。你可以召唤洞穴熊、恐狼或鹰眼翼龙的灵魂，也可以利用魔法变身成这些生物。或者你可以拥有一只恐龙伙伴。",

	"\"{@book The Ordning|BGG|2|The Ordning}\" explores the relationships among and within different giant kinds, with a focus on the ordning's role in driving adventures.": "\"{@book The Ordning|BGG|2|The Ordning}\" 探讨不同巨人种族之间和内部的关系，重点关注着`ordning`在推动冒险中的作用。",
	"\"{@book Gods and Religion|BGG|2|Gods and Religion}\" describes a pantheon of gods consisting of Annam the All-Father and his children. It also discusses various \"interlopers\" that vie for the worship of giants in Annam's absence.": "\"{@book Gods and Religion|BGG|2|Gods and Religion}\" 描述了一个包括安南（Annam）全能之父和他的子女的诸神体系。它还讨论了在安南缺席时争夺巨人崇拜的各种“闯入者”。",
	"\"{@book Social Structures|BGG|2|Social Structures}\" explores various models of giant societies and the relationships between giants and other kinds of creatures.": "\"{@book Social Structures|BGG|2|Social Structures}\" 探讨了巨人社会的各种模型以及巨人与其他种类生物之间的关系。",
	"\"{@book Organizations|BGG|2|Organizations}\" details organizations that unite giants across the lines of the ordning, bringing them together around common goals and beliefs.": "\"{@book Organizations|BGG|2|Organizations}\" 详细介绍了跨越等级制度界限的巨人组织，将它们团结在共同的目标和信仰周围。",
	"As with the rest of this book, this chapter focuses on the main families of giants described in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, but much of this advice can also be applied to other creatures of the Giant type.": "与本书的其余部分一样，本章重点介绍了{@book Monster Manual|MM}中描述的巨人主要家族，但这些建议也可以适用于其他巨人类型的生物。",
	"Apart from their size, giants are much like humans—which is to say that they're tremendously diverse and hard to generalize about. When creating a giant for your campaign, you can use the tables for {@book designing NPCs|DMG|4|Designing NPCs} in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to help you make the giant a distinctive character. Just like a Humanoid NPC, a giant with an unusual tattoo, a propensity for punning, or a knack for juggling becomes more vivid in your players' imaginations.": "除了体型外，巨人与人类非常相似——也就是说，它们在多样性方面非常丰富，很难做出概括。在为你的战役创建巨人时，你可以使用{@book designing NPCs|DMG|4|Designing NPCs}中的表格来帮助你塑造一个独特的角色。就像一个有着不寻常纹身、喜欢说绕口令或擅长玩杂耍的人形NPC一样，一个巨人在玩家的想象中会变得更加生动。",
	"When creating giant characters or roleplaying giants, remember these key elements: size, age, volume, and pride. This section describes traits and behaviors you can incorporate into your portrayal of giants to emphasize each of these elements, and offers example names for each kind of giant.": "在创建巨人角色或扮演巨人时，记住这些关键要素：体型、年龄、体积和自豪。本节描述了您可以融入到巨人表现中以强调这些要素的特征和行为，并为每种巨人提供了示例名称。",
	"The giants of the ordning are enormous, ranging from 16 to 26 feet tall. The size relationship between a giant and a human is roughly comparable to that between an adult human and a newborn human baby. A giant might think of Humanoids as akin to helpless babies, adorable pets (like small dogs), disgusting vermin (like large rats), or toy soldiers.": "(奥德宁)的巨人非常庞大，高度从16到26英尺不等。巨人和人类之间的尺寸关系大致相当于成年人类和新生婴儿之间的关系。巨人可能会把类人生物看作是无助的婴儿、可爱的宠物（如小狗）、令人厌恶的害虫（如大老鼠）或者玩具士兵。",
	"Consider how you can convey a sense of a giant's size as you play the giant. You might stand above seated players to loom over them or describe behaviors that emphasize the giant's size. The Huge Behaviors table gives examples of habits and events that can communicate a giant's enormous scale.": "在扮演巨人时，考虑如何让人感受到巨人的大小。你可以站在坐着的玩家上方，让自己高高在上，或者描述强调巨人体型的行为。《巨大行为表》提供了一些习惯和事件的例子，可以传达巨人庞大的规模。",
	"The giant has a pet (a {@creature panther}, a {@creature wolf}, or a {@creature giant weasel}) that sits on the giant's lap or shoulder.": "巨人有一只宠物（一只{@creature panther}，一只{@creature wolf}，或一只{@creature giant weasel}），它坐在巨人的膝盖或肩膀上。",
	"The giant swats at a murmuration of starlings as if it were a cloud of gnats.": "巨人像对待一群小虫一样，朝着一群星雀挥舞。",
	"The giant uses a {@item dagger|PHB} as a toothpick, a {@item greatsword|PHB} as a letter opener, or a pair of {@item Javelin|PHB|javelins} as knitting needles.": "巨人用{@item dagger|PHB}当牙签，用{@item greatsword|PHB}当开信刀，或者用一对{@item Javelin|PHB|javelins}当编织针。",
	"The giant carefully lifts Humanoids (cradling their heads to avoid injury) to see and hear them better.": "巨人小心地把人形生物（托着他们的头以避免受伤）抬起来，以便更好地看到和听到他们。",
	"The giant exclaims with admiration at the fine detail and exquisite articulation of the characters' armor.": "巨人对角色盔甲的精细细节和精湛表现赞叹不已。",
	"The giant fidgets with the skulls of Humanoids.": "巨人玩弄着人形生物的头骨。",
	"The giant drinks from a barrel as a human would from a waterskin.": "巨人像人类从水囊中喝水一样，从一个大桶中喝水。",
	"The giant takes a messy bite from a large melon held in one hand.": "巨人用一只手拿着一个大西瓜，大口地咬了一口。",
	"Giants are long-lived compared to humans, though not as much as their semidivine ancestors. Their life spans generally correspond with their place in the ordning, with hill giants living about two centuries and storm giants as many as six. Stone giants are the exception, sometimes reaching over eight hundred years of age, as enduring as the stone for which they're named. The Life Spans table shows the average life span of each kind of giant within the ordning. (Other creatures of the Giant type live about as long as humans, on average.)": "巨人与人类相比寿命更长，尽管不及他们的半神祖先。他们的寿命通常与他们在等级中的地位相对应，山岭巨人大约活两个世纪，风暴巨人长达六个世纪。石巨人是个例外，有时能活过八百多岁，和他们所命名的石头一样持久。生命跨度表显示了等级内每种巨人的平均寿命。 (其他巨人类型的生物平均寿命与人类相当。)",
	"In keeping with their long life spans, giants tend to live their lives at a slower pace than smaller folk. They often speak slowly and avoid rushing into decisions. Adding potential confusion to their interactions with smaller races, giants are often comically out of touch with happenings in the wider world, keeping a store of knowledge about Humanoid realms and peoples that was already outdated when they learned it as children. The Ancient Behaviors table suggests some ways you can communicate a giant's age in an encounter.": "与他们长寿的特点相一致，巨人倾向于以比较缓慢的节奏生活，与较小的种族相比。他们经常说话缓慢，避免匆忙做决定。与较小种族互动时可能会造成混淆，巨人通常对更广阔世界中的事物感到幽默，保留着关于人形领域和人民的知识库，这些知识在他们小时候学到时就已经过时了。《古老行为表》提供了一些方式，可以在与巨人的相遇中传达巨人的年龄。",
	"200 years": "200年",
	"Frost": "霜 (Frost)",
	"250 years": "250年",
	"350 years": "350年",

	"Storm": "风暴 (Storm)",
	"600 years": "600年",
	"Stone": "石头",
	"800 years": "800年",
	"The giant addresses Humanoids as citizens of a fallen realm (equivalent to calling people in the real world \"Babylonians\").": "巨人将人形生物称为一个沦陷领域的公民（相当于在现实世界中称呼人们为“（Babylonians）”。",
	"The giant burdens conversation with irrelevant historical context.": "巨人们在对话中提及了无关历史背景。(The giant burdens)",
	"The giant is curious about minute details of fashion, slang, and popular culture among Humanoids.": "这位巨人对人形生物的时尚细节、俚语和流行文化非常感兴趣。",
	"The giant is a hopeless procrastinator, always convinced there will be time later for any task.": "这个巨人是一个无望的拖延症患者，总是坚信会有时间来完成任何任务。",
	"The giant is prone to reminiscing about friends and family members who have died.": "这位巨人倾向于怀念已经去世的朋友和家人。",
	"The giant is unwilling to accept any problems as truly urgent.": "这位巨人不愿意将任何问题视为真正紧急。",
	"The giant is determined to wring every possible ounce of enjoyment from each day.": "这位巨人决心从每一天中尽可能地获得乐趣。",
	"The giant is convinced that giants were meant to use their long lives to make a mark on the world.": "这位巨人坚信，巨人们注定要利用他们漫长的生命在世界上留下自己的印记。",
	"Giants are loud. From the earth-shaking rumble of several-ton footsteps to ear-splitting roars supported by lungs the size of barrels, giants can make a lot of noise. Don't yell at your players, but consider raising your voice a little, and perhaps gently shaking the table to demonstrate how the earth trembles at the giant's footsteps. Finding ways to emphasize a giant's volume can help everyone at the table appreciate the scale of the encounter. The Loud Behaviors table offers more suggestions.": "巨人们很吵闹。从几吨重脚步的震地轰鸣到靠着桶大小肺腑发出的震耳欲聋的咆哮声，巨人们可以制造很大的噪音。不要对玩家大喊大叫，但考虑稍微提高你的声音，也许轻轻摇晃桌子，来展示巨人脚步所引发的地面震颤。找到强调巨人音量的方法可以帮助桌上每个人都意识到遭遇的规模。《吵闹行为表》提供了更多建议。",
	"The giant constantly (and loudly) encourages smaller creatures to speak up.": "巨人不断（大声地）鼓励较小的生物大声说话。",
	"The giant's thoughtful \"hmm\" causes a rumbling vibration in the ground and the pit of listeners' stomachs.": "巨人深思的“嗯”声引起了地面和听众胃部的隆隆震动。",
	"The giant's exclamation of surprise or anger briefly sets listeners' ears ringing.": "巨人惊讶或愤怒的呼喊让听众的耳朵短暂地嗡嗡作响。",
	"The giant's sneeze, snore, or sigh rattles windows or blows leaves off trees.": "巨人的打喷嚏、打呼噜或叹息会震动窗户或吹落树叶。",
	"The giant's laughter feels like a small earthquake.": "巨人的笑声感觉像是一场小地震。",
	"The giant's armor or weapons clang thunderously.": "巨人的盔甲或武器发出震耳欲聋的撞击声。",
	"Many giants are taught that Annam begot the giants and intended them to rule the worlds of the Material Plane. Though giants have learned many hard lessons in the millennia since their origin, a sense of self-importance still pervades their stories and inflates their vanity. It can be hard for a 16- to 26-foot-tall giant to take 3- to 7-foot-tall Humanoids and their concerns seriously. Use the Proud Behaviors table to inspire your portrayal of giants' pride and vanity.": "许多巨人被教导，安南（Annam）生下了巨人，并打算让他们统治物质位面的世界。尽管自己的起源以来，巨人们学到了许多艰难的教训，但自我重要感仍然弥漫在他们的故事中，膨胀了他们的虚荣心。对于一个身高16到26英尺的巨人来说，很难认真对待那些身高3到7英尺的人形生物及其关切。使用“自豪行为表”来激发你对巨人骄傲和虚荣的描绘。",
	"The giant ignores smaller creatures unless they offer the giant obeisance and flattery.": "巨人会无视较小的生物，除非它们向巨人表示尊敬和奉承。",
	"The giant refuses to bend over, sit, or kneel in the presence of smaller creatures.": "巨人拒绝在小型生物面前弯腰、坐下或跪下。",
	"The giant ignores the names of smaller creatures, referring to them with generic labels (such as \"human\" or \"armor shaker\").": "巨人忽略较小生物的名字，用通用标签（如“人类”或“护甲摇晃者”）来称呼它们。",
	"The giant's first reaction to smaller creatures—even when threatened or presented with a terrible problem—is laughter.": "巨人对较小生物的第一反应——即使受到威胁或面临严重问题——都是笑声。",
	"The giant constantly demeans or patronizes smaller creatures, calling them \"tiny,\" \"insignificant,\" \"babies,\" \"pests,\" \"vermin,\" or similar terms.": "这只巨人经常贬低或者居高临下地对待较小的生物，称呼它们为“微不足道”，“渺小”，“宝宝”，“害虫”，“害兽”或类似的词语。",
	"The giant won't speak any language but Giant.": "这位巨人只会说巨人语，不会说其他语言。",
	"The giant erupts in rage at the slightest sign of insult or disrespect from a smaller creature.": "巨人一旦感受到来自较小生物的侮辱或不敬，就会勃然大怒。",
	"The giant addresses smaller creatures in a tone that drips with condescension and refuses to take them seriously.": "巨人以充满轻蔑的语气对待较小的生物，并拒绝认真对待他们。",
	"If you need a name for a giant, use the Giants' Names table and freely combine or change names as you wish. You can also use a name that doesn't match the giant's kind, which might reflect, for example, a hill giant with lofty aspirations or a stone giant raised among frost giants.": "如果你需要一个巨人的名字，可以使用巨人的名字表，并随意组合或更改名字。你也可以使用一个与巨人种类不匹配的名字，比如一个有远大抱负的丘陵巨人，或者一个在冰霜巨人中长大的石巨人。",

	"As described in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, the giants of many worlds organize themselves in a complex social ranking called the ordning. At the largest scale, the ordning establishes the relative positions of the six main kinds of giants, with {@creature Storm Giant||storm giants} at the top, followed (in order) by {@creature Cloud Giant||cloud giants}, {@creature Fire Giant||fire giants}, {@creature Frost Giant||frost giants}, and {@creature Stone Giant||stone giants}, with {@creature Hill Giant||hill giants} at the bottom. Other creatures of the Giant type—such as {@creature Ettin||ettins}, {@creature Fomorian||fomorians}, and {@creature Troll||trolls}—are not counted as part of the ordning, placing them functionally below the hill giants.": "正如{@book Monster Manual|MM}所描述的那样，许多世界的巨人们按照一种复杂的社会等级制度——ordning（奥德宁）组织起来。在最大的层面上，ordning确定了六种主要巨人的相对位置，{@creature Storm Giant||storm giants}位于最顶端，其次依次是{@creature Cloud Giant||cloud giants}、{@creature Fire Giant||fire giants}、{@creature Frost Giant||frost giants}和{@creature Stone Giant||stone giants}，{@creature Hill Giant||hill giants}位于最底层。其他巨人种类的生物——比如{@creature Ettin||ettins}、{@creature Fomorian||fomorians}和{@creature Troll||trolls}——不被视为ordning的一部分，因此在功能上它们位于山岭巨人之下。",
	"At a smaller scale, every giant has a precise place within the larger framework of the ordning, and each kind of giant has a different way of assigning that place. Cloud giants rank themselves based on wealth, fire giants based on crafting skill, frost giants based on physical strength, and stone giants based on a combination of artistry and rock throwing. Hill giants give their respect to larger and stronger giants without putting much thought into hierarchical ranks. Only storm giants, largely solitary and imagining themselves above such petty concerns, have no interest in ranking themselves. Regardless of a giant's ranking within its kind, no giant can transcend the ordning of the six giant kinds; the most accomplished fire giant artisan ranks below the poorest cloud giant, for example.": "在较小的尺度上，每个巨人在整个ordning框架中都有一个精确的位置，每种巨人都有不同的方式来确定这个位置。云巨人根据财富排名，火巨人根据制造技能排名，霜巨人根据体力排名，石巨人根据艺术和投掷岩石的结合排名。丘陵巨人尊重比自己更大更强的巨人，但并不太考虑等级排名。唯有风暴巨人，通常独来独往，自认高于这些琐碎的事务，对自己排名并不感兴趣。无论巨人在其种类中的排名如何，没有一个巨人可以超越六种巨人种类的ordning；例如，最有成就的火巨人工匠排在最贫穷的云巨人之下。",
	"For any given giant (except a storm giant), you can use the Giants and the Ordning table to determine the giant's place within the ranking of that particular giant kind, and the giant's attitude toward that place. Four more tables provide suggestions for how a cloud, fire, frost, or stone giant's efforts to retain or achieve a high status within the ordning might drive adventures. (Hill and storm giants aren't included here because of their limited participation in the ordning.)": "对于任何一个巨人（除了风暴巨人），你可以使用巨人和等级表来确定该巨人在特定巨人种类中的排名，以及该巨人对该排名的态度。另外四个表格提供了关于云巨人、火巨人、霜巨人或石巨人努力保持或达到高等级地位如何推动冒险的建议。（由于山巨人和风暴巨人在等级制度中的参与有限，因此它们没有包含在这里。）",
	"The ordning strikes me as something between a god-ordained hierarchy and a true meritocracy.": "我觉得奥德宁制度介于上帝授权的等级制度和真正的精英管理制度之间。",
	"Very protective of that high status and angling to get even higher": "非常保护自己的高地位，并且力图获得更高的地位 (D&D)。",
	"Hoping to improve but not doing much to pursue an increase in status": "希望有所改善，但并没有采取太多行动来追求提升状态（D&D）。",
	"Unconcerned with maintaining that status": "不关心维持那种地位 (Unconcerned with maintaining that status)",
	"Medium": "中等 (Medium)",
	"On the rise": "蓬勃发展 (On the rise)",
	"Contented": "满足的",
	"In a state of decline": "衰落中",
	"Despairing after years of steady decline": "多年来稳定下降，感到绝望。",
	"Desperate to improve": "渴望改进 (Desperate to improve)",
	"Resigned to that status": "接受了那种状态 (Resigned to that status)",
	"Outcast": "局外人 (Outcast)",
	"Shunned by giant society": "被巨人社会所遗弃",
	"A cloud giant seeks to gain wealth by investing in an adventuring party (perhaps giving the characters magic items or other valuables) in exchange for a share of the party's rewards.": "一位云巨人希望通过投资于一个冒险队伍（也许提供角色魔法物品或其他贵重物品）来获取财富，作为交换，他会获得一部分冒险队伍的奖励。",
	"A cloud giant hosts an art gala in a cloud castle to display their wealth, providing an opportunity for the characters to retrieve an important magic item from the giant's collection.": "一位云巨人在云城堡举办艺术盛会，展示他们的财富，为角色提供了一个机会从巨人的收藏中取回一件重要的魔法物品。",

	"With two nations on the brink of war, the characters discover cloud giants are betting on the outcome—and at least one giant is meddling behind the scenes to increase the likelihood of one side winning.": "当两个国家濒临战争时，角色们发现云巨人正在赌注战争的结果——至少有一位巨人正在幕后操纵，以增加其中一方获胜的可能性。",
	"A cloud giant who recently lost a large amount of money on bad bets tries to recoup those losses by plundering a royal treasury or the adventurers' stronghold.": "一个最近在糟糕的赌博中输掉大量财富的云巨人，试图通过掠夺皇家金库或冒险者的要塞来弥补这些损失。",

	"The characters acquire a broken magic weapon that only a renowned fire giant smith can repair.": "角色们获得了一把破损的魔法武器，只有一位著名的火巨人铁匠才能修复。",
	"The characters find a giant-crafted sword—a magical masterpiece; when word of their find gets out, the artisan's descendants come looking for the sword.": "角色们发现了一把巨大的铸造剑——一件魔法杰作；当他们的发现传开后，工匠的后代们前来寻找这把剑。",
	"When the characters' enemies take refuge in a giant-built ruin, an ambitious fire giant offers to help the characters get inside in return for a share of the treasure.": "当角色的敌人躲进一个巨大的废墟时，一个雄心勃勃的火巨人提出帮助角色进入，作为回报，他要求分一部分宝藏。",

	"Planning to claim all the credit, a frost giant seeks the help of powerful adventurers to defeat a foe the giant could never handle alone.": "一个霜巨人计划要夺取所有的功劳，他寻求强大的冒险者们的帮助，来击败一个他一个人无法对付的敌人。",
	"A frost giant wants help obtaining a {@item manual of gainful exercise} believed to be in a dragon's hoard.": "一个冰巨人想要帮助获取一个{@item manual of gainful exercise}，据信它在一条龙的藏宝穴中。",

	"A frost giant keeps a defeated foe's head as a trophy; the foe's family wants justice—and the head back—and asks adventurers for help.": "一个冰霜巨人将被打败的敌人的头颅作为战利品；敌人的家人想要正义——并要求拿回头颅——他们请求冒险者的帮助。",
	"Two groups of frost giants meet near a mountain pass. When their wrestling matches cause avalanches, travelers who rely on the pass ask for help.": "两组霜巨人在一座山口附近相遇。当他们的摔跤比赛引发雪崩时，依赖这条山口的旅行者请求帮助。",

	"Don't forget simple family dynamics—or as simple as a family with ten children can be.": "不要忘记简单的家庭动态——或者说，一个有十个孩子的家庭可以有多简单。",
	"A stone giant has been throwing stones near a city in the mountains. The mayor seeks help to protect the city from the destructive effects of the boulders.": "一位石巨人在山中的一座城市附近投掷石块。市长寻求帮助，保护城市免受巨石的破坏影响。",
	"A famous Humanoid sculptor attracts stone giants to the sculptor's town. The struggling town seeks protection from the rowdy giants, who thoughtlessly cause great damage because they believe they're in the dream world.": "一位著名的人形雕塑家吸引了石巨人来到雕塑家的城镇。这个陷入困境的城镇寻求保护免受这些粗鲁的巨人的侵害，他们因为认为自己处于梦境中而毫无顾忌地造成了巨大的破坏。",
	"The characters' discovery of a huge, raw onyx attracts the attention of a stone giant who wants to carve the stone.": "角色们发现了一个巨大的未经加工的黑玛瑙，引起了一位石巨人的注意，他想要雕刻这块石头。",

	"A stone giant tries to manipulate characters into killing a fierce rival.": "一个石巨人试图操纵角色们去杀死一个凶猛的对手。",
	"Some giants reject the ordning, in part or entirely. This rejection most commonly takes one of three forms.": "一些巨人拒绝遵守（the ordning），部分或完全。这种拒绝通常采取以下三种形式之一。",
	"First are giants who hold themselves to a different standard than the one their kind traditionally values. These are often giants whose ranking within their kind is low. For example, a contemplative cloud giant might pursue knowledge rather than wealth, or a weak frost giant might trade in secrets and blackmail to hold onto some measure of power. These giants might avoid the company of their own kind to escape the expectations and customs attached to the ordning. In addition, devotees of Annam's daughters—Hiatea, Iallanis, and Diancastra—tend to push against the strict definitions of the ordning as a matter of principle.": "首先是那些将自己置于与其种族传统价值观不同标准下的巨人。这些通常是在其种族中排名较低的巨人。例如，一个沉思的云巨人可能追求知识而非财富，或者一个弱小的霜巨人可能通过交换秘密和勒索来保持一定程度的权力。这些巨人可能会避开与自己种族的交往，以摆脱与等级制度相关的期望和习俗。此外，阿南的女儿——希亚蒂亚（Hiatea）、伊阿拉尼斯（Iallanis）和迪安卡斯特拉（Diancastra）的信徒往往基于原则而反对等级制度的严格定义。",
	"Second, a few giants take a revolutionary stance meant to upset the ordning. A mighty frost giant warrior, not content to rule only frost giants and lesser creatures, could attempt to subjugate fire or cloud giants. Such revolutionaries often aim to impose their own kind's understanding of the ordning on all kinds of giants, so a master artisan among the fire giants might attempt to claim a higher place than storm giants who lack the same crafting skill. These efforts rarely have any lasting impact, but some have managed to upset the ordning at a local level for a few centuries. Because their sense of the ordning relies on physical power and military strength, frost giants are the most likely to impose their standards on other giants. Along similar lines, sometimes giants measure themselves by the standards of a different kind of giant and try to break from the ordning by exceeding those standards. A strong stone giant, for example, might try to claim a place within the frost giants' ordning.": "其次，一些巨人采取了革命立场，意在颠覆（the ordning）（巨人等级制度）。一位强大的霜巨人战士，不满足于仅统治霜巨人和次要生物，可能会试图征服火巨人或云巨人。这些革命者通常旨在将他们自己种族对（the ordning）的理解强加于所有种类的巨人之上，因此，火巨人中的一位大师工匠可能会试图比缺乏同样工艺技能的风暴巨人争夺更高的地位。这些努力很少会产生持久影响，但有些人设法在当地级别上颠覆（the ordning）长达几个世纪。由于他们对（the ordning）的理解依赖于体力和军事实力，霜巨人最有可能将自己的标准强加于其他巨人身上。同样地，有时巨人会用不同种类巨人的标准来衡量自己，并试图通过超越这些标准来打破（the ordning）。例如，一位强壮的石巨人可能会试图在霜巨人的（the ordning）中占据一席之地。",
	"Third, giants who turn from the worship of Annam's children to other powers (as described under \"{@book Gods and Religion|BGG|2|Gods and Religion}\" later in this chapter) also reject the ordning. In some cases, as in the hierarchical cults of Elemental Evil, the new religion replaces the giants' ordning with a different structure that offers the same sense of order, purpose, and meaning. Such cults place giants at a higher position than the giants would otherwise enjoy in the ordning.": "第三，背弃安南之子的崇拜，转向其他力量的巨人（如本章后面描述的“{@book Gods and Religion|BGG|2|Gods and Religion}”）也拒绝了等级制度。在某些情况下，比如元素邪恶的等级教派，新宗教会用不同的结构取代巨人的等级制度，但仍提供相同的秩序、目的和意义。这样的教派将巨人置于比等级制度中更高的位置。",
	"When giants join the cults of demon lords, they reject the entire concept of the ordning—the idea that there is any kind of order to the multiverse at all, which is the literal meaning of the word {@i ordning} in the Giant tongue. These giants reject meaning, status, and hierarchy in favor of chaos and destruction.": "当巨人加入恶魔领主的教派时，他们拒绝整个{@i ordning}的概念——这个概念是指整个多元宇宙中存在任何秩序的想法，这在巨人语中的字面意思。这些巨人拒绝意义、地位和等级制度，而选择混乱和毁灭。",
	"The Rejecting the Ordning table offers adventure hooks inspired by these ideas, illustrating how giants' attitudes toward the ordning can impact characters and the lives of Humanoids who live near them.": "拒绝守序表提供了受这些想法启发的冒险钩子，展示了巨人对守序的态度如何影响角色以及生活在他们附近的人形生物的生活。",
	"A giant wanders into a settlement of Humanoids looking for an opportunity to use talents the giant's kin do not value, but the giant is greeted with suspicion and hostility. The giant seeks adventurers to help negotiate peace with the settlement.": "一位巨人闯入一个人形生物的聚居地，寻找机会展现自己的才能，但是巨人被怀疑和敌意所对待。巨人寻求冒险者的帮助，希望能够与这个聚居地和平协商。",
	"Characters must find a wise giant who has pursued specialized knowledge instead of excellence within the ordning.": "角色们必须找到一位智慧的巨人，他追求的是专业知识，而不是在（the ordning）中的卓越。",
	"A giant tries to use the characters as pawns in a scheme to subvert the ordning and increase the giant's status.": "一个巨人试图利用角色作为棋子，以颠覆（the ordning）并提高巨人的地位。",
	"A charismatic leader gathers giants of different kinds into a mighty war band, intending to conquer and settle lands inhabited by Humanoids who seek adventurers' protection.": "一个有魅力的领袖将不同种类的巨人聚集到一支强大的战队中，意图征服并定居在由寻求冒险者保护的人形生物居住的土地上。",
	"A {@creature storm giant} asks adventurers to kill a revolutionary before the ordning is irrevocably disrupted.": "一个{@creature storm giant}请求冒险者在次序被不可逆转地打乱之前杀死一个革命者。",
	"A family of giants joined a cult of Elemental Evil and quickly took over the leadership, sorting its membership into a new hierarchy and creating dissension within the ranks—which the adventurers can use as they try to foil the cult's evil schemes.": "一家巨人加入了元素邪恶教派，并迅速掌握了领导权，将其成员分为新的等级制度，并在团体内部制造了分歧—冒险者可以利用这一点来阻止教派的邪恶阴谋。",
	"A giant serving a demon lord attacks a town. The town's leaders ask the characters to retaliate against the giant's kin—which is exactly what the demon cultist was hoping for.": "一个为恶魔领主效劳的巨人袭击了一个小镇。镇上的领导请求角色们报复这个巨人的同类——这正是那个恶魔教徒所期望的。",
	"A group of giants seeks adventurers to deal with a surge of demon cult activity within the giants' community.": "一群巨人正在寻找冒险者来应对巨人社区内恶魔邪教活动的激增。",
	"Most giants believe Annam established the ordning at the very beginning and that it reflects the birth order of his sons. One myth likens the ordning to the structure of the mountains: from lowly foothills ({@creature Hill Giant||hill giants}), up to the stone of the mountain ({@creature Stone Giant||stone giants}), the snow on the peaks ({@creature Frost Giant||frost giants}), the lava spewing from the peak of a volcano ({@creature Fire Giant||fire giants}), and then above the peak to the clouds ({@creature Cloud Giant||cloud giants}) and the storm ({@creature Storm Giant||storm giants}). These myths depict the ordning as an inherent part of what it means to be a giant, as natural as the geography of the land.": "大多数巨人相信安南（Annam）在最开始建立了等级制度，并且认为它反映了他儿子们的出生顺序。一个神话将等级制度比作山脉的结构：从卑微的山麓（{@creature Hill Giant||hill giants}）开始，到山脉的石头（{@creature Stone Giant||stone giants}），再到山峰上的积雪（{@creature Frost Giant||frost giants}），火山喷发的岩浆（{@creature Fire Giant||fire giants}），然后超越山峰到云层（{@creature Cloud Giant||cloud giants}）和风暴（{@creature Storm Giant||storm giants}）。这些神话将等级制度描绘为作为巨人的一部分的固有特征，就像大地的地理一样自然。",
	"Sagas told among giants on some worlds suggest other explanations for the ordning, linking it to the giants' fall from Annam's good graces. In some of these stories, the ordning isn't natural at all; it's part of the giants' fall—an invention of Annam's sons and a distortion of Annam's will for them. In other stories, it is a consequence of their fall—a punishment Annam inflicted on the giants after they proved themselves incapable of governing the world. The ordning might be necessary, or a burden giants are expected to bear, but giants who hold these views often look forward to Annam abolishing the ordning in some mythic future.": "在一些世界上，巨人们讲述的传说提出了关于等级制度的其他解释，将其与巨人们从安南（Annam）的恩宠中坠落联系起来。在这些故事中，等级制度并不是自然而然的；它是巨人们坠落的一部分——是安南的儿子们的发明，是对安南为他们制定的意志的扭曲。在其他故事中，这是他们坠落的后果——是安南对巨人们施加的惩罚，因为他们证明自己无法管理这个世界。等级制度可能是必要的，或者是巨人们被期望承担的负担，但持有这些观点的巨人们通常期待着安南在某个神话般的未来废除等级制度。",
	"Giants on some worlds (including Eberron) have no concept of the ordning at all. Such giants might think of themselves as a single species, with the differences among giant kinds reflecting a cultural or geographical distinction rather than an inherent one. They might live in bands composed of multiple giant kinds or family groups of a single kind. Or giants of different kinds might not recognize each other as kindred at all. All these giants build a range of social structures in the same manifold ways other peoples do, without regard to an overarching ordning.": "一些世界（包括(Eberron)）上的巨人根本没有(ordning)的概念。这样的巨人可能认为自己是同一物种，巨人种类之间的差异反映了文化或地理上的区别，而不是固有的区别。他们可能生活在由多种巨人种类组成的团体中，或者是单一种类的家庭群体。或者不同种类的巨人可能根本不认为彼此是同类。所有这些巨人以与其他民族相同的多种方式构建各种社会结构，而不考虑一个总体(ordning)。",
	"The myths of giants across the Material Plane differ in many details, but most of them portray giants as descendants of a progenitor god, typically Annam, the All-Father. Giants believe they are nearly divine, and they are inclined to view their existence as part of a mythic story that is still unfolding. Unlike some other powerful, ancient creatures (such as dragons), giants don't typically exalt themselves and demand worship from lesser beings. Rather, they are often drawn to follow gods—and sometimes other powerful beings—who help them live out their part in that epic saga.": "在物质位面上，关于巨人的神话在许多细节上有所不同，但大多数都将巨人描绘为某位始祖神的后裔，通常是全父安南姆。巨人相信自己几乎是神圣的，他们倾向于将自己的存在视为一个仍在不断展开的神话故事的一部分。与一些其他强大的、古老的生物（比如龙）不同，巨人通常不会高举自己，也不会要求次等生物崇拜他们。相反，他们经常被吸引去追随那些帮助他们在那个史诗传奇中扮演角色的神祗——有时还有其他强大的存在。",

	"Most giants revere a pantheon of gods comprising Annam and his divine children—a pantheon they call \"the Ordning\" because it is the archetype of the ordning that structures giant society. The head of the pantheon is the All-Father, but most giants view him as a remote, disinterested, or deeply disappointed father who has little role to play in giant life any more. The other ten gods, generally recognized as his children, are more important in most giants' view. The Gods of the Ordning table summarizes key information about these gods.": "大多数巨人崇拜一个由安南和他的神圣子女组成的众神体系，他们称之为“等级制”（the Ordning），因为这是构建巨人社会结构的原型。这个众神体系的头目是全能之父（the All-Father），但大多数巨人认为他是一个遥远、不感兴趣或深感失望的父亲，在巨人的生活中几乎没有什么作用。其他十位神祇通常被认为是他的子女，在大多数巨人看来更为重要。《等级制之神》表总结了关于这些神祇的关键信息。",
	"Annam is a complicated figure, depicted in a variety of ways in myths told across countless worlds of the Material Plane. These stories have been altered in the telling over the course of thousands of years. In some myths, he is the creator of worlds, and other gods merely populated the worlds Annam made with peoples of their own creation. Such myths often describe an ancient era when giants were the only people inhabiting the worlds, or giants shared the worlds with dragons. In other myths, Annam worked with other gods to create worlds together. {@i Diancastra's Saga}, told in part in the {@book introduction|BGG|0|Diancastra's Saga} to this book, describes Annam gathering the shattered fragments of the First World (the original creation of Bahamut and Tiamat) and spreading them across the Material Plane to create countless worlds. Still other myths describe Annam as a sleeping god whose dreams formed the substance of reality and allowed other gods to create within it.": "安南（Annam）是一个复杂的人物，在物质位面无数世界的神话中以各种方式被描绘。这些故事在数千年的传承中发生了改变。在一些神话中，他是世界的创造者，其他神仅仅是在安南创造的世界中填充了他们自己创造的人类。这样的神话经常描述了一个古老时代，巨人是唯一居住在世界中的人类，或者巨人与龙共享世界。在其他神话中，安南与其他神一起创造世界。《{@i Diancastra's Saga}》，部分内容收录在本书的{@book introduction|BGG|0|Diancastra's Saga}中，描述了安南聚集第一世界的破碎碎片（巴哈姆特和提阿玛特的原始创造物）并将它们散布在物质位面上创造了无数世界。还有其他神话将安南描述为一个沉睡的神，他的梦想形成了现实的物质，并让其他神在其中创造。",
	"Annam is often described as an all-knowing god whose deep learning, profound meditations, and expansive philosophy offer endless wisdom for his descendants to study. Occasionally, he's more of a trickster figure whose escapades across the worlds are greeted with uproarious laughter and serve as cautionary tales.": "安南（Annam）经常被描述为一个无所不知的神，他深邃的学识、深刻的冥想和广博的哲学为他的后裔提供了无尽的智慧供他们研究。偶尔，他更像是一个诡计多端的人物，他在世界各地的冒险引起了哄堂大笑，并作为警示故事。",
	"Giants on most worlds agree that Annam is no longer active in the affairs of giants in the Material Plane. Some say he despaired over his quarreling children. Others believe he lost hope in his descendants when their ancient empires fell into ruin. Some claim he was weakened after a long battle against his brother, Memnor (who is more commonly described as one of Annam's sons), and was forced to withdraw from the world until he regained his strength. Other dubious tales suggest he fled the Material Plane to escape the consequences of some misadventure.": "大多数世界的巨人都认为安南(`Annam`)在物质位面的巨人事务中不再活跃。有人说他对自己争吵不休的子孙感到绝望。还有人认为当他们古老的帝国陷入废墟时，他对后代失去了希望。有些人声称他在与他的兄弟梅姆诺(`Memnor`)进行长时间战斗后变得虚弱（梅姆诺更常被描述为安南的儿子之一），被迫撤离世界直到恢复实力。其他一些可疑的传说暗示他逃离物质位面以逃避某次不幸事件的后果。",
	"Thanks to his prolonged absence from mortal giants' affairs, Annam has few priests. On some worlds, he has no priests and his name is all but forgotten. On other worlds, a priest of Annam serves as an adviser and mediator to scattered groups of giants, traveling extensively to visit far-flung communities. In some places, priests of Annam are great kings who rule over realms comprising different giant kinds. Even on worlds where Annam's priests are important, many giants (sometimes including his priests) are convinced Annam no longer hears the prayers of his people.": "由于长期不参与凡人巨人事务，安南（Annam）几乎没有祭司。在一些世界上，他没有祭司，他的名字几乎被遗忘。在其他世界上，安南的祭司充当巨人散居群体的顾问和调停人，广泛旅行访问遥远的社区。在一些地方，安南的祭司是统治着不同种类巨人领域的伟大国王。即使在安南的祭司很重要的世界上，许多巨人（有时包括他的祭司）也相信安南不再听到他人民的祈祷。",
	"Diancastra is the youngest child of Annam, born of a mortal giant mother shortly before Annam retreated from the Material Plane. The saga of her effort to claim her full divine inheritance is a popular tale among giants who value guile and trickery over brute strength or magical might. The tale is also beloved because it offers hope that Annam might emerge from his self-imposed exile if his descendants can restore his faith in them.": "Diancastra (Diancastra) 是 Annam 的最小孩子，出生于一个凡人巨人母亲之前不久，就在 Annam 从物质位面撤退之前。她努力争取完整神圣遗产的传奇故事在重视狡诈和诡计胜过蛮力或魔法力量的巨人中很受欢迎。这个故事也备受喜爱，因为它给人们带来希望，如果他的后代能恢复他们对他的信仰，Annam 可能会从自我放逐中走出来。",
	"{@i Diancastra's Saga} tells of the demigod boasting to her father of her clever deeds rather than her feats of strength: she solved a sphinx's riddles, plumbed the secrets of the ocean, and stole a string of pearls from a god of the kuo-toa. Through these and many other exploits, she demonstrated not just her giant-sized might but also her bravery (bordering on foolhardiness), her talent for trickery (often aided by magical illusions), and her cleverness. Giants who value or seek to emulate these qualities pray and sacrifice to her, asking her blessing. Those who hold out hope for the restoration of giants' ancient glory worship her as well, imploring her to find her way once more to Annam's secret sanctum and persuade him to end his seclusion.": "{@i Diancastra's Saga}讲述了这位半神向她的父亲吹嘘她聪明的事迹，而不是她的力量壮举：她解开了一只狮身人面兽的谜题，探索了海洋的秘密，并从一位鱼人之神那里偷走了一串珍珠。通过这些以及许多其他冒险，她展示了不仅是她巨大的力量，还有她的勇气（接近鲁莽），她的欺诈才能（通常借助魔法幻象），以及她的聪明才智。那些重视或试图效仿这些品质的巨人向她祈祷和献祭，请求她的祝福。那些对巨人古老荣耀的恢复抱有希望的人也崇拜她，恳求她再次找到通往安南秘密圣所的道路，并说服他结束隐居。",
	"Annam's youngest son and Karontor's younger twin is Grolantor, a brash braggart who takes enormous pride in his great strength (which some would say is his only redeeming quality). Tales of Grolantor's exploits highlight his strength and his insatiable hunger, and most of them end with him in conflict with one of his siblings. To hill giants, these stories make Grolantor a figure to be admired. Among the other giants, Grolantor is the butt of every joke, always coming out poorly in comparison to his siblings. Those giants think he is a selfish boor who has no respect for the ordning, as Grolantor refuses to see why his status should not be equal to that of Stronmaus and his other brothers.": "安南的小儿子，卡隆托的年幼孪生兄弟是格罗兰托(Grolantor)，一个自负的吹牛大王，对自己的强大力量感到非常自豪（有人会说这是他唯一值得称道的品质）。关于格罗兰托的传说突显了他的力量和贪婪无厌，大多数故事都以他与其中一个兄弟发生冲突而结束。对丘陵巨人来说，这些故事让格罗兰托成为一个值得钦佩的人物。在其他巨人中，格罗兰托是每一个笑话的对象，总是与他的兄弟相比处于下风。那些巨人认为他是一个自私的粗鲁之人，对“秩序”毫无尊重，因为格罗兰托拒绝看到为什么他的地位不应该与斯特隆莫斯(Stronmaus)和其他兄弟相等。",
	"In addition to hill giants, some frost giants admire Grolantor's physical might, and many ogres and ettins revere him as well. Grolantor exemplifies the principle that the strong should take what they want, without regard for the needs of weaker creatures. The ordning holds no meaning for hill giants—who are on the bottom rung—or ogres and ettins, who are even lower. The only social order they recognize is \"might makes right.\"": "除了山岭巨人外，一些霜巨人也钦佩格罗兰托的强壮身体，许多食人魔和双头巨人也尊敬他。格罗兰托体现了强者应该随心所欲地取得他们想要的东西，而不顾及较弱生物的需求的原则。对于山岭巨人（处于底层）、食人魔和双头巨人（甚至更低）来说，等级制度没有任何意义。他们唯一承认的社会秩序就是“强者为尊”。",
	"Grolantor's priests often boast of having experienced a personal interaction with their god—a dream, waking vision, or even an encounter with a manifestation of Grolantor. These encounters typically involve the god demanding something he wants from the priests, such as a fresh kill or a precious trinket. His priests then demand (and often take by force) sacrifices for Grolantor from their kin, with a minimum of ritual or prayer involved.": "格罗兰托(Grolantor)的祭司经常夸耀曾经与他们的神有过亲密互动——梦境、清醒幻象，甚至是与格罗兰托的显现相遇。这些互动通常涉及神向祭司要求他想要的东西，比如新鲜的猎物或珍贵的小玩意。然后他的祭司从他们的亲属那里要求（并经常使用武力夺取）为格罗兰托献祭，往往只需最少的仪式或祈祷。",
	"Hiatea is Annam's second child, after Stronmaus, and the companionship and friendly rivalry between these two oldest children are the focus of many myths. In these stories, Hiatea is both a protective figure who keeps watch over the hearths and fields of giants, blessing their agriculture and their family lives, and a wild huntress who wields the power of nature as a weapon of destruction as well as a source of bounty. Some myths suggest her mother hid her among firbolgs after her birth, where Hiatea focused on strengthening communities. Then, when she learned of her true parentage, she pursued arduous quests as a hunter and monster slayer to prove her worth to her father. (It's possible that {@i Diancastra's Saga}, excerpted in the {@book introduction|BGG|0|Diancastra's Saga} to this book, alludes to this story when Annam compares Diancastra's deeds to Hiatea's.) Another myth suggests Stronmaus taunted Hiatea for remaining aloof from a bitter war against dragons, spurring her to prove herself a valiant warrior as well as a champion of peaceful giants.": "海亚提亚（Hiatea）是安南（Annam）的第二个孩子，在斯特隆莫斯（Stronmaus）之后，这两个最年长的孩子之间的伴侣关系和友好竞争是许多神话的焦点。在这些故事中，海亚提亚既是一个保护者，守护着巨人们的炉灶和田地，祝福他们的农业和家庭生活，又是一个野性女猎手，挥舞着自然的力量作为毁灭的武器，同时也是丰盛的来源。一些神话暗示她的母亲在她出生后将她藏在费尔博格（firbolgs）之中，海亚提亚专注于加强社区。然后，当她得知自己的真正身世时，她开始进行艰难的探险，成为一名猎人和怪物杀手，以证明自己对父亲的价值。（可能是《{@i Diancastra's Saga}》，这本书的{@book introduction|BGG|0|Diancastra's Saga}中摘录的，当安南将迪安卡斯特拉的行为与海亚提亚相比时，暗示了这个故事。）另一个神话暗示斯特隆莫斯嘲讽海亚提亚对抗龙的激烈战争保持冷漠，激励她证明自己是一名勇敢的战士，同时也是和平巨人的冠军。",
	"Giants of all kinds offer prayers to Hiatea, ranging from simple blessings at the kindling of a hearth fire to thanksgivings at the conclusion of a successful hunt or harvest. She is the most popular god of the Ordning among goliaths and firbolgs, who claim a distant kinship with giants.": "各种巨人都向海雅提供祈祷，从点燃炉火时的简单祝福到成功狩猎或丰收结束时的感恩祷告不等。她是巨人中最受石巨人和森林巨人欢迎的神，他们声称与巨人有着遥远的亲属关系。",
	"Hiatea's priests adopt one of two roles, reflecting the god's dual areas of concern. Some live within the giants' enclaves and focus their efforts on maintaining the community, tending to agriculture, and educating children. Others patrol the wilderness surrounding the enclave, guarding against threats to the community.": "海亚提亚的祭司们扮演着两种角色中的一种，反映了这位神关注的双重领域。有些居住在巨人的飞地内，专注于维护社区、耕种农田和教育儿童。另一些则在飞地周围巡逻，防范对社区的威胁。",
	"Born about the same time as Grolantor, Iallanis is everything her boorish brother is not: kind, loving, merciful, joyful, and thoughtful. She loves every part of the worlds her father made, and she constantly strives to bring not only her divine family but also mortal giants together in harmony. Iallanis envisions a restored giant empire as a realm of benevolence, learning, and innovation where giants lead but do not rule like tyrants.": "与格罗兰托(Grolantor)几乎同时诞生的伊拉尼斯(Iallanis)，是她粗鲁兄弟的完全对立面：善良、慈爱、仁慈、快乐和深思熟虑。她热爱她父亲创造的世界的每一个部分，她不断努力，不仅要让她的神圣家族团结一致，还要让凡人巨人和谐共处。伊拉尼斯设想一个恢复的巨人帝国，作为一个仁慈、学习和创新的领域，在这里巨人们领导，但不像暴君一样统治。",
	"Good-aligned giants who appreciate her ideals pray to Iallanis for peace, unity, and mercy. Her priests often officiate weddings among giants, even evil ones. Stone giants frequently appeal to her as an artistic muse, trusting that her love of beauty will inspire their work.": "那些遵循正义的巨人们欣赏她的理念，向伊拉尼斯祈求和平、团结和仁慈。她的祭司经常主持巨人们的婚礼，甚至是那些邪恶的巨人。石巨人经常将她视为艺术灵感的源泉，相信她对美的热爱会激发他们的创作。",
	"Karontor is the elder twin of Grolantor. In a handful of myths, Karontor appears as a wicked schemer whose hatred of his brothers knows no bounds. The fomorians once occupied a place in the ordning corresponding to Karontor's place, but then Karontor incited the fomorians to assault the Feywild. Just as the fomorians were banished into the Underdark, so too did Annam banish Karontor to a subterranean prison.": "卡隆托尔(Karontor)是格罗兰托(Grolantor)的长兄。在一些神话中，卡隆托尔被描绘为一个邪恶的阴谋家，对他的兄弟充满仇恨。巨人族曾经在等级制度中占据了卡隆托尔的位置，但后来卡隆托尔煽动巨人族进攻了精灵界。正如巨人族被放逐到地底世界一样，安南(Annam)也将卡隆托尔放逐到了一个地下监狱。",
	"Few dare to worship Karontor, even in secret. Superstitious giants believe if his name is spoken, Karontor might burrow up from the Underdark to drag the hapless speaker underground to an eternity of torture. To avoid uttering his name, giants sometimes refer to him as \"the banished son,\" \"the forgotten one,\" or \"the king that crawls.\" A few cults revere him, beseeching him for sinister magical secrets or to consume their enemies.": "很少有人敢崇拜卡隆托(Karontor)，即使是秘密地。迷信的巨人相信，如果说出他的名字，卡隆托可能会从地底深处钻出来，把不幸的说话者拖入地下，受尽永恒的折磨。为了避免说出他的名字，巨人们有时会称呼他为“被放逐的儿子”，“被遗忘者”，或者“爬行之王”。少数邪教崇拜他，请求他赐予邪恶的魔法秘密或吞噬他们的敌人。",
	"When it comes to Memnor, the wisest policy is the simplest: don't believe a single thing you read.": "当涉及到Memnor时，最明智的策略就是最简单的：不要相信你所读到的任何一件事情。",
	"Memnor is an ambiguous figure in the mythology of giants, and the tales concerning him are so disparate that it's possible two gods exist with the same name. More likely, the confusion surrounding his nature and identity is a result of his own duplicity. In most myths, Memnor is constantly tricking and infuriating his father, drawing Annam's wrath down on himself and (more often) his brothers. In one myth, Memnor is Annam's sinister twin, constantly challenging his brother for control of the worlds. In this tale, Annam defeated Memnor but was left so weakened by the contest that Annam fled to his private sanctum, leaving his children to govern the affairs of the giants.": "梅姆诺（Memnor）是巨人神话中一个模糊的人物，关于他的故事如此不一，以至于可能存在两个同名的神。更有可能的是，围绕他的本质和身份的混乱是他自己复杂性的结果。在大多数神话中，梅姆诺不断欺骗和激怒他的父亲，招致安南（Annam）的愤怒，常常也波及到他的兄弟们。在一个神话中，梅姆诺是安南的邪恶孪生兄弟，不断挑战他的兄弟控制世界。在这个故事中，安南击败了梅姆诺，但由于比赛而变得虚弱，安南逃到了他的私人圣所，将巨人事务交给了他的孩子们管理。",
	"Memnor is typically described as clever and persuasive on the one hand, and as sly and manipulative on the other. His brothers often suspect him of trying to usurp Annam's place at the head of the Ordning to rule all the affairs of giantkind. Among mortal giants, the same accusation is often leveled against his priests. But giants who revere him for his charisma and intellect insist he has the welfare of all giants at heart, seeking to restore them to their proper place at the head of all creation.": "Memnor（梅姆诺）通常被描述为聪明和有说服力，另一方面又被认为狡猾和善于操纵。他的兄弟们经常怀疑他试图篡夺安南（Annam）在巨人界的领导地位，统治所有巨人的事务。在凡人巨人中，同样的指控经常被用来指责他的祭司。但那些崇敬他的巨人因他的魅力和智慧而坚称他心怀所有巨人的福祉，寻求将他们恢复到创世界的领导地位。",
	"Memnor has wicked priests within his fold who emulate his duplicity, his self-interest, and his manipulative ability to make others do exactly what he wants—usually to their own detriment. These priests often undermine or exploit the ordning to their own benefit. Without careful investigation, it's impossible to separate these villains from the ranks of those priests of Memnor who faithfully serve the ordning, acting as advisers and advocates at every rank of giants' society.": "梅姆诺（Memnor）麾下有邪恶的祭司，他们效仿他的狡诈、自私和操纵能力，使他人按他的意愿行事——通常是对他们自己不利。这些祭司经常破坏或利用等级制度以谋取自己的利益。如果不经过仔细调查，就无法将这些恶棍与那些忠实服侍等级制度的梅姆诺祭司区分开来，后者在巨人社会的每个等级中充当顾问和倡导者。",
	"Despite being the fifth of Annam's sons, Skoraeus (called \"Stonebones\" by his stone giant followers) is depicted as the wisest among them, particularly knowledgeable about magic, wards, hidden treasures, and the secrets of the earth. It is said he gave Surtur the secret of smelting, showed Thrym how to carve magic runes on weapons, and crafted spears for Hiatea so she could complete her tasks of valor. A dour loner, Skoraeus often sits on the sidelines during the schemes and battles of his siblings. He appears in one myth after other as an observer, a confidant to the other gods, and a keeper of secrets.": "尽管是Annam的第五个儿子，Skoraeus（被他的石巨人追随者称为“石骨”）被描绘为他们中最睿智的，特别是对魔法、结界、隐藏宝藏和地球的秘密有着丰富的知识。据说他向Surtur透露了冶炼的秘密，向Thrym展示了如何在武器上刻上魔法符文，并为Hiatea制作了长矛，以便她能完成她的英勇任务。Skoraeus是一个阴郁的独行者，经常在他的兄弟姐妹的阴谋和战斗中坐在一旁。他在一个又一个神话中出现，作为一个观察者，其他神的知己，以及秘密的守护者。",
	"Giants invoke Skoraeus's name when they begin any work of art or craft, particularly stonework, and they often dedicate the final product to his glory. Stone giants pray to Stonebones, the Great Creator, in a much broader range of circumstances, eager for divine insight as they carry out their daily lives. His priests undertake frequent pilgrimages into the Underdark, seeking revelation from Skoraeus in the depths of the earth.": "巨人们在开始任何艺术或工艺品的创作时会祈求斯科雷乌斯(Skoraeus)的名字，尤其是石工作品，他们经常将最终成品奉献给他的荣耀。石巨人们在更广泛的情况下向石骨(Stonebones)，伟大的创造者，祈祷，渴望在日常生活中得到神圣的启示。他的祭司经常前往地底世界进行朝圣，寻求来自斯科雷乌斯在地底深处的启示。",
	"Annam's eldest child is jovial Stronmaus, whose greatest failing in myth is his inability to see the foolishness, jealousy, and outright evil that festers in the souls of his brothers. His boundless energy, sunny optimism, and zest for life pervade the legends that tell of his many mighty deeds. A few tales, though, describe a dramatic change in Stronmaus after his father's withdrawal from the Ordning, which left Stronmaus effectively in charge of the pantheon. Since then, Stronmaus has become brooding, aloof, and melancholy, deeply frustrated with his inability to unite the gods of the Ordning—and hurt by his father's abandonment.": "安娜姆的长子是开朗的斯特隆莫斯(%Stronmaus%)，在神话中他最大的缺点是无法看到他的兄弟们心灵中滋生的愚蠢、嫉妒和彻头彻尾的邪恶。他无穷无尽的活力、阳光般的乐观和对生活的热情贯穿于讲述他众多伟大事迹的传说中。然而，一些故事描述了在他父亲退出等级制度(%Ordning%)后，斯特隆莫斯发生的戏剧性变化，这使得他事实上成为了诸神团体的负责人。从那时起，斯特隆莫斯变得忧郁、孤僻和忧郁，对于无法团结等级制度中的众神深感沮丧，并因为父亲的抛弃而受伤。",
	"All giants acknowledge Stronmaus's place on the throne of the gods in Annam's absence, but to most of them, he is but a steward, an inadequate substitute for the All-Father. They offer the required prayers and sacrifices (a scattering of fragrant herbs and incense on the wind each morning), but their prayers often sound more like a list of grievances than honest worship. His priests are drawn from giants who occupy high positions within the ordning of their kind, including wealthy cloud giants, strong frost giants, and accomplished stone giants. Being a priest of Stronmaus has no effect on a giant's rank in the ordning; instead, it often makes the giant a target of resentment and complaints from other giants.": "所有巨人都承认在(`Annam`)缺席时(`Stronmaus`)在众神宝座上的地位，但对于他们大多数人来说，他只是一个管家，一个不足以取代全能之父的替代品。他们提供所需的祈祷和祭品（每天早晨在风中撒下一些芬香草药和香），但他们的祈祷常常听起来更像是一份怨言清单，而不是真诚的崇拜。他的祭司来自于在他们种族的等级制度中占据高位的巨人，包括富有的云巨人、强壮的霜巨人和有成就的石巨人。成为(`Stronmaus`)的祭司对巨人在等级制度中的地位没有影响；相反，它经常使巨人成为其他巨人抱怨和怨恨的目标。",
	"Surtur is the elder twin of Thrym, and rivalry has driven the two gods from the moment of their birth. Surtur is generally depicted as the cleverer of the two, often outwitting his brother in contests where Thrym's greater strength might otherwise let him prevail. Their history of competition ranges from striving to outdo each other in childhood accomplishments to bloody battles that ended only when their father or one of their siblings intervened. Other myths describe cunning Surtur leading his brother on dangerous adventures, typically leaving mayhem and destruction in their wake. Aside from his escapades involving Thrym, Surtur is known for his unsurpassed skill at metalwork, especially forging weapons and armor.": "Surtur（苏尔图尔）是Thrym（瑟林）的长兄，两位神祇自出生之时便展开了竞争。Surtur通常被描绘为两者中更聪明的一个，经常在比赛中智胜他的兄弟，即使Thrym的更大力量本应让他取胜。他们之间的竞争历史从竭力超越对方的童年成就到血腥的战斗，只有在他们的父亲或兄弟介入时才结束。其他神话描述了狡猾的Surtur领导他的兄弟进行危险的冒险，通常在他们离开后留下混乱和破坏。除了与Thrym有关的冒险之外，Surtur以其无与伦比的金属工艺技能而闻名，尤其擅长锻造武器和盔甲。",
	"Giants pray to Surtur in search of creative inspiration and ask his blessing on their smithies. They invoke his name when they light forges, kilns, and ovens. Among fire giants, the worship of Surtur is often tinged with the expectation of a coming battle that will destroy worlds, slay many gods, and upend the ordning, leaving fire giants as the undisputed masters of all creation. Surtur's fire giant priests stoke the flames of this expectation when they address Surtur as \"the All-Consuming Flame\" or \"the Cleansing Fire.\" Some priests stockpile weapons—ranging from ordinary swords and axes to magical devices of devastating potential—in preparation for this great battle.": "巨人们祈祷索尔图尔（Surtur）以寻求创意灵感，并请求他祝福他们的铁匠铺。他们在点燃锻炉、窑炉和烤炉时祈求他的名字。在火巨人中，对索尔图尔的崇拜常常伴随着对即将到来的一场毁灭世界、杀死许多神灵、颠覆秩序的战斗的期待，使火巨人成为所有创造物的无可争议的主宰。索尔图尔的火巨人祭司们在称呼索尔图尔为“吞噬一切的火焰”或“净化之火”时，煽动着这种期待的火焰。一些祭司为了这场伟大的战斗而囤积武器，从普通的剑和斧头到具有毁灭性潜力的魔法装置不一而足。",
	"As Surtur's younger twin, Thrym is described in myths as his brother's rival and coconspirator. He is depicted as the stronger and braver of the two, and he often comes out on top in contests and conflicts where those qualities outweigh Surtur's cleverness. Thrym is often described as a bully, frustrated that Annam seemed to favor Surtur; he vents that frustration by harassing his younger brother Skoraeus. Thrym appears in myth as the greatest warrior of the Ordning. He leads bands of mortal giants in raids and skirmishes, bringing glory to giantkind and striking terror into the enemies of Annam's children.": "作为苏尔特的年幼孪生兄弟，索尔姆在神话中被描述为他兄弟的对手和同谋。他被描绘为两者中更强壮和更勇敢的那个，并且在那些品质超过苏尔特的聪明的竞赛和冲突中经常取得胜利。索尔姆经常被描述为一个恶霸，因为安南似乎更喜欢苏尔特而感到沮丧；他通过骚扰他的年幼弟弟斯科雷乌斯来宣泄这种沮丧。索尔姆在神话中被描述为奥德宁中最伟大的战士。他领导着一群凡人巨人进行袭击和小规模战斗，为巨人族带来荣耀，并给安南的子民的敌人带来恐惧。",
	"Giants sometimes ask Thrym for his blessing before hunting or going to war, and they pour out blood from their kills to thank Thrym for their success. Thrym's priests are war leaders who offer military counsel to the leaders of giant communities.": "有时巨人在狩猎或参加战争前会请求弗瑞姆的祝福，他们会倒出猎物的鲜血以感谢弗瑞姆给予他们成功。弗瑞姆的祭司是战争领袖，为巨人社区的领袖提供军事建议。",
	"Annam's withdrawal has caused ongoing upheaval in the religious lives of giants across the Material Plane. Most believe Annam turned from his descendants in anger or disappointment, and many hope he can be convinced to return to his divine throne if the giants restore their ancient glory. But some giants believe that Annam is dead, that he is petulant and unworthy of worship, or that he will never reclaim his throne. Some of these giants look for purpose in the service of other gods or powers. Giants who remain faithful to the gods of the Ordning call these other powers \"interloper gods,\" believing they are trespassing on the territory of Annam's children and intruding into the affairs of giants. A giant who worships these gods violates the ordning; giants' proper place in the multiverse is above such monstrous beings as demon lords, elemental evils, and gods who are not Annam's children, so it is upside-down for a giant to serve these entities. Giants who follow interloper gods are cast out of society if they are discovered, but they believe the benefits of serving those powers outweigh the risk of exile.": "安南的撤退在物质位面的巨人们的宗教生活中引起了持续的动荡。大多数人相信安南因愤怒或失望而背弃了他的后裔，许多人希望如果巨人们恢复古老的荣耀，他就能被说服重返神位。但一些巨人认为安南已经死了，认为他任性且不值得崇拜，或者认为他永远不会重新夺回他的王座。这些巨人中有些人在其他神祇或力量的服务中寻找目的。仍然忠于《等级制度》中的神祇的巨人称这些其他力量为“闯入者神”，认为它们侵犯了安南的子民的领土，干涉了巨人的事务。崇拜这些神的巨人违反了《等级制度》；巨人在多元宇宙中的适当位置应该高于那些如恶魔领主、元素邪恶和非安南子民的神那样的怪物。因此，巨人为这些实体服务是颠倒的。如果发现崇拜闯入者神的巨人，他们会被社会驱逐，但他们相信为这些力量服务的好处大于被流放的风险。",
	"Some myths suggest Vaprak is a child of Annam and thus properly belongs to the Ordning, but others say he formed from Annam's spilled blood. For a variety of reasons, he is never accorded equal status to the All-Father's other children. Known as the Destroyer, Vaprak is prone to mindless, destructive rampages. The god is described as a greenish creature strongly resembling a troll. Indeed, legend suggests {@creature Troll||trolls} formed from Vaprak's blood in the same way he came from Annam's, and many trolls venerate him. Some ogres and giants also worship Vaprak, particularly giants who despair of ever rising in the ordning.": "一些神话传说暗示瓦普拉克是阿南姆的孩子，因此应该属于（Ordning），但也有人说他是由阿南姆流出的血液形成的。由于各种原因，他从未被视为与全能之父的其他孩子地位相等。瓦普拉克被称为“毁灭者”，容易陷入无意识的破坏性暴行。这位神被描述为一种绿色生物，强烈地类似巨魔。事实上，传说表明{@creature Troll||trolls}以与他与阿南姆的关系相同的方式形成于瓦普拉克的血液中，许多巨魔崇拜他。一些食人魔和巨人也崇拜瓦普拉克，特别是那些绝望于在（Ordning）中崛起的巨人。",
	"Service to a demon lord is tempting to many giants, particularly those frost and hill giants who value size and strength above all. For these giants, demon worship paradoxically offers both freedom from the strictures of the ordning (and from the notion of a cosmic order more generally), and exactly the kind of power their ordning rewards. Of the countless rulers of the infinite Abyss, four have particular influence among giantkind.": "对许多巨人来说，侍奉恶魔领主是非常诱人的，特别是那些重视体型和力量胜过一切的霜巨人和丘陵巨人。对于这些巨人来说，恶魔崇拜矛盾地提供了摆脱(及更普遍地摆脱宇宙秩序观念)的自由，同时也提供了他们的秩序所奖励的那种力量。在无尽深渊的无数统治者中，有四位对巨人族群有特殊影响。",
	"As described in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, Baphomet the Horned King encourages his followers to embrace their fundamentally bestial nature. Giants who delight in the frenzy of battle and bloodshed are easily lured to the demon lord's service. Stone giants who feel stifled and repressed by their society sometimes break free in dramatic fashion by embracing Baphomet's creed (see the {@creature stalker of Baphomet|BGG} in {@book chapter 6|BGG|6|Stalker of Baphomet}).": "正如在{@book Monster Manual|MM}中描述的那样，角王巴尔弗梅特鼓励他的追随者拥抱他们根本的野兽本性。喜欢战斗和流血的巨人很容易被引诱加入这位恶魔领主的服务。有时候，感到被社会压抑和束缚的石巨人会通过拥抱巴尔弗梅特的信条（见{@book chapter 6|BGG|6|Stalker of Baphomet}中的{@creature stalker of Baphomet|BGG}）以戏剧性的方式挣脱束缚。",
	"Demogorgon has few followers among the giants of the ordning, but ettins often recognize a kindred spirit in the two-headed demon lord. The {@creature echo of Demogorgon|BGG} in {@book chapter 6|BGG|6|Echo of Demogorgon} is an ettin cultist who has received Demogorgon's hideous gifts.": "德莫戈根在奥汀的巨人中拥有少数追随者，但双头恶魔领主常常会在双头巨人身上认出一个同类精神。{@creature echo of Demogorgon|BGG}在{@book chapter 6|BGG|6|Echo of Demogorgon}中是一个双头巨人邪教徒，已经得到了德莫戈根可怕的馈赠。",
	"Though he is not terribly important in the Abyss, the demon lord Kostchtchie is revered by many giants, particularly frost giants. Part of his appeal is his willingness (when bribed with bloody offerings) to inspire his worshipers with ferocity and bloodlust. More than any other demon lord, what he offers his followers—raw strength and fury in battle—appeals directly to the values shared by many frost giants, making him appear as an exemplar of the giants' ideals. The {@creature fury of Kostchtchie|BGG} in {@book chapter 6|BGG|6|Fury of Kostchtchie} is an example of a frost giant whose devotion to the demon lord has brought great and terrible rewards. ({@creature Kostchtchie|BGDIA} is described in {@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA}.)": "尽管在深渊中并不十分重要，恶魔领主科斯特奇（Kostchtchie）受到许多巨人的崇敬，尤其是霜巨人。他的吸引力之一是他愿意（在被血腥祭品贿赂时）激发他的信徒们的凶猛和嗜血。与其他任何恶魔领主不同的是，他所提供给他的追随者——战斗中的原始力量和狂怒——直接吸引了许多霜巨人所共享的价值观，使他看起来像是巨人理想的典范。{@creature fury of Kostchtchie|BGG} 在 {@book chapter 6|BGG|6|Fury of Kostchtchie} 是一个例子，他对这位恶魔领主的忠诚带来了巨大而可怕的回报。({@creature Kostchtchie|BGDIA} 在 {@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA} 中被描述。)",
	"Gnolls, ghouls, and some hill giants share two strange commonalities: insatiable hunger and a tendency to serve the demon lord Yeenoghu. Sometimes a hill giant who delights in senseless slaughter turns to the Beast of Butchery for help in achieving more senseless slaughter. Occasionally, an indiscriminately hungry hill giant consumes some item of unspeakable corruption and takes on a fiendish nature, falling under Yeenoghu's sway. In either case, the result is a horrible monster with a gullet akin to the bottomless Abyss itself (see the {@creature maw of Yeenoghu|BGG} in {@book chapter 6|BGG|6|Maw of Yeenoghu}).": "豺狼人、食尸鬼和一些丘陵巨人有两个奇怪的共同点：无尽的饥饿和倾向于侍奉恶魔领主伊诺古。有时，一个喜欢无意义屠杀的丘陵巨人会寻求屠戮兽的帮助，以实现更多无意义的屠杀。偶尔，一个贪婪无度的丘陵巨人会食用某种不可言说的腐化物品，并具有邪恶的本性，沦为伊诺古的控制之下。无论哪种情况，结果都是一个可怕的怪物，其食喉类似于无底深渊本身（见{@creature maw of Yeenoghu|BGG}中的{@book chapter 6|BGG|6|Maw of Yeenoghu}）。",
	"Another popular avenue for giants who turn from the gods of the Ordning derives from giants' close ties to the Elemental Planes. The nameless horror called the Elder Elemental Eye perverts natural elements, limiting them to their most destructive aspects in a way that appeals to giants who are disposed toward evil. More than most members of individual Elemental Evil cults, giants see the big picture of the four cults working toward the common goal of elemental cataclysm. Some giants even worship the Elder Elemental Eye directly rather than serving one of the subordinate cults.": "另一个受到巨人欢迎的转向离开Ordning诸神的途径源自巨人与元素位面的密切联系。被称为“上古元素之眼”的无名恐怖扭曲了自然元素，将它们限制在最具破坏性的方面，这种方式吸引了那些有邪恶倾向的巨人。与大多数个别元素邪恶教派的成员不同，巨人看到了四个教派共同致力于元素灾变这一共同目标的全局。一些巨人甚至直接崇拜“上古元素之眼”，而不是侍奉其中一个从属教派。",
	"As described earlier in this chapter (see \"{@book Rejecting the Ordning|BGG|2|Rejecting the Ordning}\"), membership in the cults of Elemental Evil replaces the ordning with a different hierarchy—one in which giants gravitate toward the top. Giants who worship Elemental Evil alongside smaller peoples offer welcome physical (and sometimes magical) power to these cults, making them an even more significant force in the world. Intelligent and charismatic giants might enter positions of leadership in an elemental cult, while less cunning giants might become lieutenants or personal bodyguards of cult leaders.": "正如本章前面所描述的（见“{@book Rejecting the Ordning|BGG|2|Rejecting the Ordning}”），邪恶元素教派的成员取代了巨人的等级制度，建立了一个不同的等级制度——在这个制度中，巨人们倾向于处于顶层。和其他种族一起崇拜邪恶元素的巨人为这些教派提供了强大的肉体（有时还有魔法）力量，使它们在世界中变得更加强大。聪明和有魅力的巨人可能会在元素教派中担任领导职务，而不那么狡猾的巨人可能会成为教派领袖的副手或个人保镖。",
	"Examples of giants serving each of the Elemental Evil cults appear in {@book chapter 6|BGG|6}.": "在{@book chapter 6|BGG|6}中出现了为每个元素邪恶教派效劳的巨人的例子。",
	"Giants who devote themselves to Ogrémoch and his earth cult—mostly hill and stone giants—seek the power to destroy the works of civilization with landslides, sinkholes, or mighty earthquakes.

	"Giant cultists of Olhydra are mostly frost giants who see ice and cold as ultimate expressions of water's destructive power. They believe the seas and deep waters are eager to reclaim the water trapped in the bodies of living creatures and feel duty-bound to return others to the primal waters by drowning them, shedding their blood, or freezing them in ice.": "奥海德拉(Olhydra)的巨人教徒主要是霜巨人，他们认为冰雪和寒冷是水的毁灭力量的最终表现。他们相信海洋和深水渴望夺回生物体内被困的水，因此觉得有责任通过淹死、流血或冰冻来将他人归还原始水域。",
	"Fire giants who join Imix's cult yearn to burn away the impurities of the world in volcanic eruptions and uncontrolled fires, creating a wasteland of ash ruled by fiery Imix alone. They believe the world and all its peoples are wicked and degenerate and seek to purify the world by reducing it to smoking cinders.": "加入伊米克斯（Imix）教派的火巨人渴望在火山喷发和失控的火灾中燃烧世界的杂质，创造一个被火热伊米克斯（Imix）统治的灰烬荒原。他们相信世界和所有的人都是邪恶和堕落的，希望通过将世界化为冒着烟的余烬来净化世界。",
	"Giants who follow Yan-C-Bin and his air cult, mostly cloud and a few storm giants, worship the devastating power of wind and storms. They aren't generally interested in destruction for its own sake, but they delight in the power to punish those who have wronged them and to express personal freedom through mayhem.": "追随(Yan-C-Bin)和他的风之教的巨人，主要是云巨人和一些风暴巨人，崇拜风和暴风雨的毁灭力量。他们通常不是为了毁灭而感兴趣，但他们喜欢惩罚那些冤枉他们的人，并通过混乱来表达个人自由的力量。",
	"Some giants devote themselves to other powerful primordial creatures of the Elemental Planes, such as Maegera the Inferno, Mual-Tar the Thunder Serpent, and Draunn the Stonemaw. In practice, cults devoted to these primordials have similar aims and methods to cults of Elemental Evil.": "一些巨人致力于其他元素位面强大的原始生物，比如烈焰之主梅格拉(Maegera)、雷霆巨蛇穆阿尔-塔(Mual-Tar)和石颚德劳恩(Draunn)。实际上，致力于这些原始生物的教派与元素邪恶教派有着类似的目标和方法。",
	"Like other peoples, giants may choose to give their service and devotion to many different gods, not just the children of Annam or particular cults. On some worlds, the gods of the Ordning are unknown (perhaps forgotten) or known by different names. There, giants might have their own gods or worship the same gods other peoples do.": "与其他种族一样，巨人可能选择将他们的服务和忠诚奉献给许多不同的神，而不仅仅是Annam的子女或特定的教派。在一些世界上，巨人可能不了解（或许已经被遗忘）或以不同的名字认识到Ordning的神。在那些世界上，巨人可能拥有自己的神或崇拜其他种族所崇拜的神。",
	"Giants might also turn from their traditional gods to serve devils, {@creature Kraken||krakens}, Great Old Ones, archfey, or other powerful ancient beings. {@book Chapter 6|BGG|6} includes examples of several such giants: the {@creature fire hellion|BGG}, the {@creature storm herald|BGG}, and the {@creature fomorian warlock of the dark|BGG}.": "巨人们也可能放弃他们传统的神灵，而侍奉恶魔，{@creature Kraken||krakens}，古老的伟大存在，大妖精，或其他强大的古代存在。{@book Chapter 6|BGG|6}包括几个这样的巨人的例子：{@creature fire hellion|BGG}，{@creature storm herald|BGG}，和{@creature fomorian warlock of the dark|BGG}。",

At minimum, make sure all your players are comfortable with that kind of quandary before presenting it in your game.": "一般来说，最好避免将巨大的孩子当作怪物对待。即使是巨大的幼儿也可能危险，但他们无法与能够对付巨人父母的冒险者相提并论。年幼的巨人并不比其他有自由意志的生物更邪恶，因此与他们战斗并杀死他们可能会给正义取向的角色带来许多道德问题。至少，在将这种困境呈现在游戏中之前，请确保所有玩家都对这种情况感到舒适。",

	"For a giant teenager, use the {@creature ogre} stat block. Increase the Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores to 10 or match the parents' scores, whichever is lower.

Remove {@sense darkvision} (unless the teenager is a stone giant) and adjust the teenager's weapons and armor as you see fit.": "对于一个巨人青少年，使用{@creature ogre}的属性块。将智力、感知和魅力分数增加到10，或与父母的分数相匹配，以较低者为准。 （这也将使青少年的被动感知分数提高到10。）移除{@sense darkvision}（除非青少年是石巨人），并根据需要调整青少年的武器和盔甲。",
	"For a young adult giant, use the stat block of a giant lower in the ordning. For example, {@adventure Storm King's Thunder|SKT} includes {@creature Young Cloud Giant|SKT|young cloud giants} that use the {@creature hill giant} stat block with several adjustments. You can craft the stat block as you see fit to match the challenge rating you're aiming for.": "对于年轻成年的巨人，使用(ordning)中较低的巨人的属性块。例如，{@adventure Storm King's Thunder|SKT}包括使用{@creature hill giant}属性块的{@creature Young Cloud Giant|SKT|young cloud giants}，并进行一些调整。您可以根据需要调整属性块，以匹配您所追求的挑战等级。",
	"For a giant child of any age, you can further modify one of these stat blocks by adding the parents' damage immunities and resistances (if any) and any inherent traits.": "对于任何年龄的巨人孩子，你可以通过添加父母的伤害免疫和抗性（如果有的话）以及任何固有特性来进一步修改这些属性块。",
	"Though most giants are social creatures, some live alone by choice or circumstance. They establish lairs in remote places, or they tend ancient ruins or enclaves that were more recently abandoned. Some wander the world, hoping to learn as much of its ways as they can; others are hermits who seek spiritual enlightenment in solitude. Some reclusive giants enjoy their solitude, while others are desperately lonely or eager to find a settlement where they can live among their own kind.": "尽管大多数巨人是社交性生物，但有些出于选择或环境的原因而选择独居。它们在偏远地区建立巢穴，或者照料古老的废墟或最近被遗弃的地方。有些漫游世界，希望尽可能多地了解世界的方式；另一些是寻求灵性启蒙的隐士。一些隐居的巨人享受他们的独处，而另一些则非常孤独，渴望找到一个可以与自己种族一起生活的定居点。",

	"An approaching giant alarms the people of a small town, who ask the adventurers to protect them.

The giant agrees to leave the town in peace if the adventurers will help find a new home for the giant.": "一位正在接近的巨人引起了一个小镇的居民们的恐慌，他们请求冒险者们保护他们。但这位和平的巨人只是在寻找一个新的巨人社区加入，因为他逃离了一场内部冲突肆虐的社区。如果冒险者们愿意帮助找到一个新家园给这位巨人，那么这位巨人就同意和平地离开这个小镇。",

	"When giants are separated from or shunned by their own kind, they often end up living as exiles among other peoples. Giants who are very low in the ordning might leave their own kind to lord over lesser creatures. Giants who turn to the worship of interloper gods and are cast out of giants' society might live among other worshipers of the same gods. Occasionally, giants take up residence in bustling cities full of Humanoid peoples where they might attract attention but not necessarily open hostility.": "当巨人与自己的同类分离或被排斥时，他们通常会成为其他种族中的流亡者。在等级制度中排名很低的巨人可能会离开自己的种族，去统治较低等级的生物。而转向崇拜入侵者神灵并被巨人社会驱逐的巨人，可能会与其他崇拜同一神灵的信徒一起生活。偶尔，巨人会在充满类人种族的繁华城市中定居，他们可能会吸引注意，但不一定会遭受开放的敌意。",
	"Giants who live among smaller folk tend to gravitate to positions of importance. They might take on the role of crime lords or business owners. They often surround themselves with luxury as if they were aristocrats among their smaller neighbors. They sometimes take on the role of patrons for artists or adventurers, or take it upon themselves to teach smaller folk. The Exiles table offers ideas for adventures featuring exiled giants in a variety of such roles.": "生活在较小种族中的巨人往往倾向于担任重要职位。他们可能会扮演犯罪首领或企业主的角色。他们常常将自己包围在奢华之中，仿佛是在他们较小的邻居中的贵族。他们有时会担任艺术家或冒险家的赞助人，或者自愿教导较小种族。《放逐者表》提供了关于流亡巨人扮演各种角色的冒险想法。",

	"The giants most commonly encountered in the world are bands of two to four who are united by a common purpose. These are often warriors engaged in raiding, hunting, or a mission on behalf of the leader of their home community. Sometimes these bands are religious in nature—a small community dedicated to the service of a god (whether a member of the Ordning or an interloper god) and pursuing that god's interests in the world. A band could also be a group of young giants who want to experience the world before they get tied down with the responsibilities of adult life. A giant band might be accompanied by pets or by other creatures that share the giants' purpose or do the giants' bidding.": "在世界上最常见的巨人是由两到四个人组成的团队，他们因共同目的而团结在一起。这些团队通常是参与抢劫、狩猎或代表他们家园社区的领袖执行任务的战士。有时这些团队具有宗教性质——一个致力于为某位神（无论是巨人等级制度的成员还是一个闯入者神）服务并在世界中追随该神利益的小社区。一个团队也可能是一群年轻的巨人，他们想在被成年生活的责任束缚之前体验世界。一个巨人团队可能会有宠物或其他与巨人目的相同或为巨人服务的生物陪伴。",

Each chapter is independent from all others, and the chief stewards of different chapters rarely meet and coordinate their efforts, except in cases where evils arise that threaten an entire world or multiple worlds.": "永恒王座的管理者组织成一个骑士团，拥有许多分部。每个分部包括居住在广阔地理区域内的所有管理者，也许是一个大陆或者物质位面整个世界，由一位首席管理者领导。每个分部独立于其他所有分部，不同分部的首席管理者很少会见面并协调他们的努力，除非出现威胁整个世界或多个世界的邪恶。",
	"Members of the Stewards of the Eternal Throne swear an oath of service to the order's mission. The specifics of the oath vary from chapter to chapter, but the fundamental tenets are the same in every chapter:": "永恒王座的管理者们发誓要为该组织的使命服务。誓言的具体内容因章节而异，但每个章节的基本原则都是相同的：",
	"We are custodians of the worlds, not rulers, and we work to preserve what has been entrusted to our care.": "我们是世界的守护者，而非统治者，我们努力保护被托付给我们的事物。",
	"Smaller and weaker peoples deserve our protection, not subjugation. We are strong and shelter the smaller folk behind our strength.": "较小和较弱的人民应该得到我们的保护，而不是被征服。我们强大并在我们的力量背后庇护较小的人。",
	"Though we have forgotten much of the wisdom of our ancestors, we strive to ensure all peoples can pursue wisdom, learning, and enlightenment.": "尽管我们已经遗忘了许多祖先的智慧，我们仍努力确保所有人民都能追求智慧、学习和启迪。",
	"We foster peace among all peoples. All who desire to live peaceably together are welcome among us.": "我们促进所有人民之间的和平。所有希望和平共处的人都在我们之中受到欢迎。",
	"Knights of the Stewards of the Eternal Throne are mostly giants (predominantly cloud and storm giants), but some orders have been known to accept goliaths, firbolgs, and members of other peoples into their ranks. ({@race Goliath|MPMM|Goliaths} and {@race Firbolg|MPMM|firbolgs} appear as character races in {@book Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}, and examples of these peoples appear in {@book chapter 6|BGG|6} of this book.)": "永恒王座的执事骑士大多是巨人（主要是云巨人和风暴巨人），但也有一些团体接受巨灵、冰巨人和其他种族的成员加入他们的行列。({@race Goliath|MPMM|Goliaths}和{@race Firbolg|MPMM|firbolgs}是{@book Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}中的角色种族，这本书的{@book chapter 6|BGG|6}中也有这些种族的例子。)",
	"The principle of peace leads the knights to cooperate with other peoples, especially with beings they regard as near equals in age and importance, including dwarves, elves, and dragons. If a fundamental sin of the ancient giants was warring with these folk in the early years of the world, then cooperation with them is essential to undoing that sin and charting a new course for giantkind and other peoples. As part of this commitment, the stewards honor not just the gods of the giants, but also the gods revered by these other folk.": "和平的原则使骑士们与其他民族合作，尤其是那些他们视为同龄人和同等重要的存在，包括矮人、精灵和龙。如果古代巨人的一个根本罪过是在世界初期与这些族群交战，那么与他们合作对于消除那个罪过并为巨人族和其他民族开辟新道路至关重要。作为这一承诺的一部分，守护者不仅尊敬巨人的神明，还尊敬其他族群所崇敬的神灵。",
	"Each chapter of the Stewards of the Eternal Throne has a stronghold that is intended as a living embodiment of its central principles. These strongholds are mighty fortresses meant to withstand whatever evils might besiege them. They are bastions of peace and equality where diverse peoples can live together under the leadership, protection, and tutelage of giants—as Annam intended.": "《永恒王座的守护者》(Stewards of the Eternal Throne) 的每一章都有一个据点，旨在作为其核心原则的生动体现。这些据点是强大的堡垒，旨在抵御可能围攻它们的任何邪恶。它们是和平与平等的堡垒，在巨人的领导、保护和指导下，各种不同的人民可以共同生活—正如安南(Annam) 所期望的那样。",
	"The Eternal Throne Adventures table offers hooks you can use to involve characters in the business of these giant knights.": "永恒王座冒险表提供了一些线索，可以让角色参与这些巨骑士的事务。",
	"Many people know of giants only as raiding bands. Such folks often greet well-meaning knights of the Stewards of the Eternal Throne with fear, to their detriment.": "许多人只知道巨人是掠夺性的团伙。这样的人经常因为恐惧而对永恒王座守护者的善意骑士表示怀疑，这对他们是不利的。",
	"Characters arriving in a remote village are greeted by a stern giant who urges them to move along quickly, as the town is under the giant's protection.": "一群角色抵达一个偏远村庄，被一个严厉的巨人所迎接，他催促他们迅速离开，因为这个村庄正受到巨人的保护。",
	"A wandering knight of the stewards asks adventurers for help closing a planar portal that is allowing demons to spill across the countryside.": "一位流浪的守护骑士请求冒险者帮助关闭一个次元门，这个门正在让恶魔涌入乡间。",

	"A saga chanted among the giants of the Worldroot Circle describes a great tree that grew on the First World at the dawn of time. Planted and tended by the god Corellon, this tree was a seedling of the mighty Yggdrasil, the World Tree that connects all the Outer Planes. When the First World was destroyed, seeds from this great tree scattered into the void of the Material Plane. Myths say Annam nurtured each of these seeds until they sprouted and formed worlds of their own—all the myriad worlds that now constitute the Material Plane.": "在世界根源圈的巨人中传颂的传说描述了一个伟大的树，在时间的黎明时期生长在第一世界上。这棵树是由神柯瑞隆种植和照料的，它是强大的世界树——世界之树——尤格德拉希尔的幼苗，连接着所有外部位面。当第一世界被摧毁时，这棵伟大树的种子散落到物质位面的虚空中。神话说安南（Annam）照料着这些种子，直到它们发芽并形成了自己的世界——现在构成物质位面的无数世界。",
	"Giants of the Worldroot Circle tell this story as a way to remember their purpose. They imagine themselves to be Annam's gardeners, tasked with tending the roots of all the worlds he made. On some worlds, they literally tend a great world tree they believe to be a seedling of the tree on the First World. On other worlds, they believe some other geographical feature is the \"root of the world,\" such as a towering mountain or mesa, a yawning cavern deep under the mountains, or a meteorite in an enormous crater. Whatever forms these roots take, the giants believe they are nexus points linking the worlds to each other and to the Outer Planes.": "世界根圈的巨人们讲述这个故事是为了铭记他们的使命。他们想象自己是安南的园丁，负责照料他所创造的所有世界的根基。在一些世界上，他们确实照料着一棵他们认为是第一世界上那棵树的幼苗的巨大世界树。在其他世界上，他们认为其他一些地理特征是“世界之根”，比如一座高耸的山峰或台地、深入山脉下方的巨大洞穴、或者一个巨大陨石坑中的陨石。无论这些根基采取什么形式，巨人们相信它们是将世界与彼此以及外部位面连接起来的关键节点。",
	"When giants of the Worldroot Circle gather at the roots of their worlds, they perform rites meant to preserve the roots, nurture the health of the world, and enable a mystical communion among members of the order—both the ones present and those on other worlds. Much like Humanoid druids, these giants strive to maintain the forces of nature in their delicate balance and oppose any forces—even the forces of gods such as Surtur and Thrym—that threaten to elevate one element over the others or to distort the elements beyond their natural proportions.": "当世界根源圈的巨人们聚集在他们世界的根部时，他们进行的仪式旨在保护根源，培育世界的健康，并促进该秩序成员之间的神秘交流-无论是在场的人还是其他世界上的人。与类人德鲁伊一样，这些巨人努力维持自然力量的微妙平衡，并反对任何力量-甚至是苏尔特和瑟姆等神灵的力量-威胁要提升一个元素超过其他元素，或者扭曲元素超出其自然比例。",
	"Though the giants of the Worldroot Circle tend to live in remote wildernesses, they protect their worlds and are often concerned with global or even planar threats. They fiercely oppose the cults of Elemental Evil and remain constantly vigilant against unnatural corruption, including Undead and Aberrations. They guard against forces that threaten to undo the work of creation or corrupt the roots of the worlds, including destructive demons. The Worldroot Circle Adventures table provides examples of how these druidic giants might become involved in adventures in your campaign.": "尽管世界根源圈的巨人们往往生活在偏远的荒野中，他们保护自己的世界，并经常关注全球甚至是位面的威胁。他们激烈反对元素邪恶的教派，并始终警惕不自然的腐化，包括不死生物和畸变体。他们防范那些威胁破坏创世之工或腐蚀世界根源的力量，包括毁灭性的恶魔。《世界根源圈冒险表》提供了这些德鲁伊巨人如何参与你们冒险的例子。",
	"Giants of the Worldroot Circle need smaller adventurers to brave the caves beneath their world tree to stop whatever is gnawing or corrupting its roots.": "世界树圈的巨人需要更小的冒险者勇敢地探索他们世界树下面的洞穴，阻止任何在啃食或腐蚀它根部的东西。",

	"Long ago, the Worldroot Circle helped seal portals where invaders from another plane broke through. Now one of those portals has reopened, and the characters must find giants to reseal it.": "很久以前，世界根源圈帮助封印了入侵者从另一个位面闯入的传送门。现在其中一个传送门重新打开了，角色们必须找到巨人来重新封印它。",
	"Multiple oracles see visions of a great evil entering the world through a portal at its root, so adventurers are sent to find the place and ensure the portal doesn't open. They arrive to find giants of the Worldroot Circle locked in a losing battle to hold back the evil.": "多位神谕者看到一个巨大的邪恶通过根源之地的传送门进入世界，因此冒险者被派遣前去找到这个地方，并确保传送门不会打开。他们到达后发现世界之根圈的巨人们正在进行一场苦战，试图阻止邪恶的入侵。",

	"Diancastra's divine nature was not revealed to me until our second meeting, when she helped me put an end to a cult dedicated to Elemental Evil and its leader, a truly vicious cloud giant. I think she appreciated what our fists together could do!": "直到我们第二次见面时，Diancastra的神性才向我显露出来。在那次见面中，她帮助我终结了一个致力于元素邪恶的邪教，以及其领袖，一个真正邪恶的云巨人。我想她欣赏我们共同的拳头所能做到的事情！",

	"\"{@book Campaigns|BGG|3|Campaigns}\" helps you establish the role of giants in your game world and place these mighty peoples—past or present—in the forefront of your campaign.": "\"{@book Campaigns|BGG|3|Campaigns}\" 帮助你在游戏世界中确立巨人的角色，并将这些强大的种族——无论是过去还是现在——置于你的冒险活动的前沿。",
	"Giants are social creatures, often living together in families or bands, or accompanied by smaller followers. Even when they live in isolation, they often keep pets or servants. While an encounter might consist of a single giant, more typical encounters include a mix of one or more giants with other creatures.": "巨人是社交性动物，通常生活在家庭或团体中，或者有较小的追随者陪伴。即使他们独自生活，他们也经常养宠物或仆人。在一次遭遇中可能只有一个巨人，更典型的遭遇包括一个或多个巨人与其他生物的混合。",
	"This section is loaded with inspiration to help you create such encounters, whether you're planning a single encounter or populating a giant-filled enclave. The tables are broken into two categories: \"{@book Giantkind Encounters|BGG|3|Giantkind Encounters}\" and \"{@book Connected Creatures|BGG|3|Connected Creatures}.\" The first includes tables for each of the six main families of giants, plus death giants and fomorians. The second covers a variety of other creatures often found alongside giants, including other creatures of the Giant type.": "这一部分充满了灵感，可以帮助你创建这样的遭遇，无论你是在计划一个单独的遭遇还是在填充一个巨人聚集的飞地。这些表格分为两类：\"(0)\" 和 \"(1)\"。第一类包括了六大巨人家族的表格，还有死亡巨人和巨人族。第二类涵盖了各种经常与巨人一起发现的其他生物，包括巨人类型的其他生物。",
	"When a creature's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block. Creatures marked with an asterisk (*) appear in this book. Those marked with a dagger (†) appear in {@book Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}.

	"Giants are dangerous foes. The encounter tables in this section are most suitable for use with characters in the third tier of play (levels 11–16). If you're creating giant-themed encounters for lower-level characters, you might use more dangerous creatures in the background to establish the setting of the adventure, or use them in a nonhostile capacity. For example, if you're creating encounters for a 6th-level party, a fight against two storm giants would make for a dreadfully one-sided battle. Instead, the characters could witness the giants in an altercation from a distance, foreshadowing a conflict that will threaten all the smaller folk in the region. Or you could decide the giants are indifferent or friendly toward the characters, leading to a dramatic interaction that might offer hooks to adventures more appropriate to your party's level. See the \"Giants and Tiers of Play\" sidebar for more advice.": "巨人是危险的敌人。本节中的遭遇表最适合用于第三级别游戏（11-16级）的角色。如果你要为低级别角色创建以巨人为主题的遭遇，你可以在背景中使用更危险的生物来建立冒险的背景，或者以非敌对的方式使用它们。例如，如果你要为一个6级队伍创建遭遇，与两个风暴巨人的战斗将会是一场极不公平的战斗。相反，角色可以从远处目睹巨人之间的争执，预示着一场将威胁到该地区所有较小民族的冲突。或者你可以决定巨人对角色们漠不关心或友好，导致戏剧性互动，可能提供适合你队伍级别的更合适的冒险线索。查看“巨人和游戏级别”旁注以获取更多建议。",

When you plan giant encounters, pay attention to how much damage the giants can deal in a single attack. Many giants can kill lower-level characters with a single hit.": "(等级秩序)的巨人对有丰富经验的角色来说是合适的威胁。在计划与巨人的遭遇时，要注意巨人在单次攻击中能造成多少伤害。许多巨人可以用一击杀死低等级的角色。",
	"Use the guidelines in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} or {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE} to build appropriately challenging encounters for your party. The guidelines here can help you plan adventures featuring giants for each tier of play:": "根据{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}或{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}中的指导方针，为你的队伍构建适当具有挑战性的遭遇。这里的指导方针可以帮助你计划每个游戏阶段都有巨人的冒险。",
	"{@creature Ogre||Ogres} are the most suitable Giant opponents for characters in the first tier of play, and characters at level 4 might face a single {@creature hill giant}. A lone hill giant can feel confident bullying (or eating) the inhabitants of a village, but more powerful giants (and larger groups) set their sights higher.": "在游戏的第一层级中，{@creature Ogre||Ogres} 是角色们最适合对抗的巨人对手，而4级的角色可能会面对一个单独的{@creature hill giant}。一个孤独的丘陵巨人可以自信地欺负（或吃掉）一个村庄的居民，但更强大的巨人（和更大的团队）会把目光投向更高处。",
	"A single {@creature Stone Giant||stone}, {@creature Frost Giant||frost}, {@creature Fire Giant||fire}, or {@creature cloud giant} is an appropriate challenge for characters in this tier. Near the top of this tier, characters might challenge two {@creature Hill Giant||hill giants} or possibly a {@creature storm giant}. The intrusion of these giants into settled lands is a threat that a whole kingdom or region notices.": "在这个层次中，一个单独的{@creature Stone Giant||stone}，{@creature Frost Giant||frost}，{@creature Fire Giant||fire}或{@creature cloud giant}对角色来说是一个适当的挑战。在这个层次的顶部附近，角色可能挑战两个{@creature Hill Giant||hill giants}或者可能是一个{@creature storm giant}。这些巨人闯入定居区域是整个王国或地区都会注意到的威胁。",
	"Three to five {@creature Hill Giant||hill giants} are an appropriate challenge for characters at this level, as are two to three {@creature Stone Giant||stone} or {@creature Frost Giant||frost giants}, two {@creature Fire Giant||fire} or {@creature Cloud Giant||cloud giants}, or a single {@creature storm giant}. Large groups of giants, when they are organized toward a single purpose, can determine the fate of nations.": "在这个级别，三到五个{@creature Hill Giant||hill giants}对角色来说是一个合适的挑战，两到三个{@creature Stone Giant||stone}或{@creature Frost Giant||frost giants}，两个{@creature Fire Giant||fire}或{@creature Cloud Giant||cloud giants}，或一个单独的{@creature storm giant}也是如此。当巨人们团结一致追求一个共同目标时，他们可以左右国家的命运。",
	"Mighty characters in the fourth tier can challenge as many as eight {@creature Hill Giant||hill giants}, four to five {@creature Stone Giant||stone} or {@creature Frost Giant||frost giants}, three to five {@creature Fire Giant||fire} or {@creature Cloud Giant||cloud giants}, or two to three {@creature Storm Giant||storm giants}.

	"Each table entry presents a short description of the creatures in an encounter and what they're doing. Use these ideas as inspiration to fit the encounter into the location you're populating. If that context doesn't make sense for the situation you're building, consider using the context to inspire the creature's general motivation. For example, if you roll a 12 on the {@book Cloud Giant Encounters table|BGG|3|Cloud Giant Encounters}, it might not make sense for a cloud giant to be searching for the {@book Misty Vale|BGG|4|Misty Vale} (an enclave described in {@book chapter 4|BGG|4}) in that particular location. You might decide there is a clue to the vale's location in this place, or you can simply treat the giant's search for the Misty Vale as an overarching goal, regardless of what the giant is doing when the encounter occurs. That choice can influence how you roleplay the giant if the characters engage in conversation.": "每个表格条目都提供了遭遇中生物的简短描述以及它们正在做的事情。利用这些想法来激发你将遭遇融入所要填充的场景中。如果这个背景对你正在构建的情况没有意义，考虑利用这个背景来激发生物的一般动机。例如，如果你在{@book Cloud Giant Encounters table|BGG|3|Cloud Giant Encounters}上掷出了一个12，那么一位云巨人在这个特定位置搜寻{@book Misty Vale|BGG|4|Misty Vale}（在{@book chapter 4|BGG|4}中描述的一个飞地）可能就没有意义。你可以决定在这个地方有关于谷地位置的线索，或者你可以简单地将巨人对雾谷的搜索视为一个全局目标，无论巨人在遭遇发生时正在做什么。这个选择会影响你在角色扮演中如何扮演巨人，如果角色们进行对话的话。",
	"Each creature on these tables includes a suggested attitude roll in parentheses after its name. To randomly determine the initial attitude of creatures in an encounter, roll the dice specified in the parentheses, then refer to the appropriate line of the Initial Attitudes table.": "在这些表格中，每个生物的名称后面都包括一个建议的态度骰（%num%）。要随机确定遭遇中生物的初始态度，请掷骰子指定的次数，然后参考初始态度表的适当行。",
	"4 or lower": "4或更低 (4 or lower)",
	"Hostile": "敌对的 (Hostile)",
	"Indifferent": "冷漠 (Indifferent)",
	"9 or higher": "9或更高 (9 or higher)",
	"Friendly": "友好",
	"If an attitude doesn't fit what the creature is doing, you can either ignore the attitude or shape the encounter to match it. For example, if you roll an indifferent or friendly attitude for a creature that is hunting prey, you might decide the hunter simply doesn't find the characters to be a tasty treat. If the creature is sapient, it could ask the characters if they've seen which way its quarry has gone.": "如果一个生物的态度与其所做的事情不符，你可以选择忽略这个态度，或者调整遭遇内容以适应它。例如，如果你为一只正在猎物的生物掷骰得到了中立或友好的态度，你可以决定这只猎人只是觉得角色们不是它喜欢的美食。如果这个生物是有智慧的，它可能会询问角色们是否看到了它的猎物逃向了哪个方向。",
	"This section includes encounter tables themed around each of the six kinds of giants in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, plus {@book death giants|BGG|6|Death Giants} (found in {@book chapter 6|BGG|6}) and {@book fomorians|BGG|6|Fomorians}.

	"The Death Giant Encounters table is appropriate for places steeped in gloom, whether within the Shadowfell or touched by that plane's sorrowful influence. The creatures on this table might populate places where giants fell into despair, sites where giants delved too deeply into necromantic magic, or areas where the Negative Plane's life-consuming influence seeps into the world.": "死亡巨人遭遇表适用于充满阴暗气氛的地方，无论是在暗影界内还是受到那个位面悲伤影响的地方。这张表上的生物可能会出现在巨人们陷入绝望的地方，巨人深陷于死灵魔法的地方，或者负面位面的吞噬生命影响渗入世界的地方。",

	"Use the four Elemental Encounters tables to populate areas suffused with the elemental and magical nature of giants or places where the Elemental Planes break into the Material Plane. The creatures on these tables might be connected to the cults of Elemental Evil (described in {@book chapter 2|BGG|2|Elemental Evil}). Magical conduits might draw creatures from the Elemental Planes and disgorge them within powerful storms, deep chasms, tumultuous wildfires, or ocean maelstroms. Elemental forces might also come to the world to oppose their elemental rivals from opposite planes: air versus earth or fire versus water.": "使用四个元素遭遇表来填充被巨人的元素和魔法本质浸透的区域，或者是元素位面侵入物质位面的地方。这些表中的生物可能与元素邪恶的教派有关（在{@book chapter 2|BGG|2|Elemental Evil}中描述）。魔法导管可能会吸引元素位面的生物，并将它们排放到强大的风暴、深邃的峡谷、汹涌的野火或海洋漩涡中。元素力量也可能来到这个世界，与来自相反位面的元素对手作对：空气对抗土地，火对抗水。",

	"The Elemental Water Encounters table can be useful in any aquatic environment, not just one where the Plane of Water extends its reach. An ancient giant enclave sunken in some great catastrophe or a storm giant retreat beneath the sea is an appropriate locale for these encounters.": "元素水遭遇表格可以在任何水域环境中发挥作用，不仅仅是在水之位面延伸其影响的地方。一个在某场大灾难中沉没的古老巨人聚居地，或者一个风暴巨人在海底的撤退地都是这些遭遇的合适场所。",
	"Use the Fiendish Incursion Encounters table for situations where giants have turned from the gods of the Ordning to serve fiends (as described in {@book chapter 2|BGG|2|Interloper Gods}), where the ancient magic of long-fallen realms of giants opened portals to the Lower Planes (either intentionally or by accident), where magic runes have gone horribly awry and unleashed fiendish corruption into the world, or where fiends seek powerful allies to aid their schemes among mortals.": "使用《邪恶入侵遭遇表》来描述一些情况，比如巨人们背弃了{@book chapter 2|BGG|2|Interloper Gods}的奥德宁之神而侍奉恶魔，古老巨人王国的魔法打开了通往下层位面的传送门（无论是有意还是意外），魔法符文出现了严重失误，释放出恶魔腐化到世界中，或者恶魔寻求强大的盟友来帮助他们在凡间的阴谋中。",

	"Use the Giant Construct Encounters table to populate ancient giants' ruins that have been sealed from the outside world for millennia or hostile environments without breathable air. The creatures in these encounters might also act as servitors to magically powerful giants or serve as a reminder of the forgotten magic of ancient giants.": "使用巨型构造体遭遇表来填充已经被封闭数千年或没有可呼吸空气的敌对环境中的古代巨人遗迹。这些遭遇中的生物可能会充当魔法强大巨人的仆人，或者作为古代巨人已被遗忘的魔法的提醒。",
	"You can alter the appearance of any Construct on this table to reflect the nature of its creators. An iron golem built by fire giants might spew embers and sooty smoke between its iron plates, while one built by cloud giants might leak wisps of mist and raindrops. Any of these Constructs might have Giant runes engraved somewhere on them as part of the magic that animates them. You can alter any Construct's size without changing any of the creature's other statistics.": "你可以改变这张表上任何构装的外观，以反映其创造者的本质。由火巨人制造的铁魔像可能会在铁板之间喷出余烬和烟尘，而由云巨人制造的铁魔像可能会散发薄雾和雨滴。这些构装中的任何一个可能在某处刻有巨人符文，作为赋予它们生命的魔法的一部分。你可以改变任何构装的大小，而不改变其它任何统计数据。",

	"My brothers will scoff and tell you that these giant kin don't matter, that they don't count in the ranking of the ordning, that they're irrelevant to the world. But they DO matter, and you overlook them at your peril—not just the danger they pose as foes, but the value they can bring as allies.": "我的兄弟们会嗤之以鼻地告诉你，这些巨人族并不重要，它们在等级制度中并不算数，它们对世界毫无意义。但它们确实重要，你忽视它们是危险的，不仅是它们作为敌人所带来的危险，还有它们作为盟友所能带来的价值。",
	"Use the Giant Necropolis Encounters table to populate places where giants once thrived that have been destroyed, fallen into decline, or succumbed to necromantic magic.

	"The Megafauna World Encounters table suggests encounters with gigantic animals that might appear in a \"lost world\" where long-forgotten versions of modern animals still thrive.

	"Three of D&D's earliest published adventures featured giants as the primary opponents: {@i Steading of the Hill Giant Chief}, {@i The Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl}, and {@i Hall of the Fire Giant King}. (They were originally published in 1978, compiled together as {@i Against the Giants} in 1981, and reprinted multiple times in the decades since, most recently in 2017's {@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP-ATG}.) The premise of these adventures is simple: \"giants have been raiding civilized lands,\" so adventurers are assembled \"to punish the miscreant giants.\" The adventurers fight their way up the ordning until their final confrontation with the fire giant king—and the revelation that the giants are merely pawns in the schemes of some sinister drow.": "D&D最早出版的三个冒险故事中，巨人是主要对手：{@i Steading of the Hill Giant Chief}，{@i The Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl}，和{@i Hall of the Fire Giant King}。 (它们最初是在1978年出版的，1981年合并编译成{@i Against the Giants}，并在之后的几十年中多次重印，最近一次是在2017年的{@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP-ATG}。) 这些冒险故事的设定很简单：“巨人一直在袭击文明土地”，因此冒险者们被召集起来“惩罚这些恶棍巨人”。冒险者们一路战斗直至他们最终与火巨人国王对决，发现这些巨人只是某些邪恶黑暗精灵阴谋中的棋子。",
	"An adventure focused on giants as adversaries could involve a sustained battle against giants of a single kind (as each of the individual adventures in {@adventure Against the Giants|TftYP-ATG} did), or it could involve progression through groups of different kinds of giants (as {@i Against the Giants} pitted characters against hill, frost, and fire giants in sequence). Alternatively, an adventure could involve giants of different kinds working together, perhaps united as members of a religious order or some other kind of organization that crosses the divide of giant kinds (see \"{@book Gods and Religion|BGG|2|Gods and Religion}\" and \"{@book Organizations|BGG|2|Organizations},\" both in {@book chapter 2|BGG|2}).": "一个以巨人为对手的冒险可能涉及对单一种类巨人的持续战斗（就像{@adventure Against the Giants|TftYP-ATG}中的每个独立冒险那样），或者可能涉及穿越不同种类巨人群体的进展（就像{@i Against the Giants}中将角色置于山岭、霜和火巨人的顺序中）。另外，一个冒险也可以涉及不同种类巨人共同合作，也许作为一个宗教团体的成员或者其他跨越巨人种类分歧的组织（参见“{@book Gods and Religion|BGG|2|Gods and Religion}”和“{@book Organizations|BGG|2|Organizations}”，都在{@book chapter 2|BGG|2}中）。",

	"Sometimes giants are background elements to an adventure that has more to do with the impact of the giants' actions on the world than it does with the giants themselves.

An adventure might also challenge characters to drive the giants (and other forces of destruction) away from settled lands.": "有时候，巨人只是冒险中的背景元素，与巨人本身无关，而更多地与巨人的行动对世界的影响有关。这些冒险可能是灾难故事，角色可能会帮助旁观者逃生。灾难的源头可能是两个巨人（或两组巨人）之间的冲突，巨人与另一个强大怪物（如龙、恐龙、{@creature purple worm}或{@creature tarrasque}）之间的冲突，或者是一个真正巨大的巨人（如{@book chapter 6|BGG|6}中描述的{@book scions of giants' gods|BGG|6|Scions of Giants' Gods}）的苏醒。冒险也可能挑战角色将巨人（和其他破坏力量）驱离有人居住的土地。",
	"The giant in a scenario like this need not be the villain.

	"Surtland is an example of a realm of giants inspired by Norse myth. This realm is one of ten worlds that make up the Magic: The Gathering setting of Kaldheim, all moving among the branches of a vast World Tree. Wintry Surtland is a realm of constant turmoil. Volcanoes burst through snow and ice to form new mountains as the bitter cold freezes steaming geysers into sprays of ice shards. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions reshape the landscape almost daily. Avalanches of snow and broken rock tumble down mountainsides and change the course of half-frozen rivers.": "Surtland（苏特兰）是受北欧神话启发的巨人领域的一个例子。这个领域是《魔法：聚会游戏》卡尔德海姆（Kaldheim）设定中的十个世界之一，它们都位于一棵巨大世界树的枝干之间。冬季的Surtland是一个不断动荡的领域。火山突破积雪和冰层，形成新的山脉，严寒冻结着冒着蒸汽的间歇泉成为冰片的喷射。地震和火山喷发几乎每天都在重塑着景观。雪崩和破碎的岩石从山坡上滚落下来，改变着半冻结河流的流向。",
	"The frost and fire giants of Surtland are locked in constant conflict. The frost giants prefer to be left alone, but they also claim the best, safest territories in the realm, building gleaming ice palaces on high mountain peaks and glacier fields. In addition, they hoard treasures and arcane secrets for themselves. The fire giants build shelters in the lowlands, where lava fissures carve paths through wide fields of snow, and the fire giants gather in bands to attack the frost giants.": "苏特兰（Surtland）的冰霜巨人和火焰巨人一直处于不断的冲突之中。冰霜巨人更喜欢独自生活，但他们也声称领域中最好、最安全的地盘，建造闪闪发光的冰宫，坐落在高山峰和冰川地带。此外，他们还为自己囤积财宝和神秘秘密。火焰巨人则在低地建造避难所，熔岩裂缝穿过广阔的雪原，火焰巨人聚集成群，袭击冰霜巨人。",
	"At times, the worlds of Kaldheim overlap as they move around the World Tree. Such an overlap—called a Doomskar—is an explosive event marked by world-altering earthquakes and geological destabilization.

This world could be the ancient past of a setting such as the Forgotten Realms or Eberron, where empires of giants thrived thousands of years ago.

As you build such a world, consider these four key questions:": "你可以将你的冒险设定在一个世界中，巨人仍然统治着较小种族——正如巨人们可能会说的那样，这是安南（Annam）的意愿。这个世界可以是《被遗忘的国度（Forgotten Realms）》或《艾伯隆（Eberron）》等背景的古代，数千年前巨人帝国繁荣昌盛的时代。或者这可以是你自己创造的世界，也许是一个巨人们已经维持统治数代的世界。在构建这样一个世界时，考虑以下四个关键问题：",
	"{@b How do different kinds of giants live together?} The world might have a single empire of giants where giants hold ranks based on their position in the ordning.

Or there might be different realms that all include multiple kinds of giants.": "{@b How do different kinds of giants live together?} 世界可能存在一个由巨人组成的单一帝国，巨人根据在（Ordning）中的地位来排名。或者可能存在几个较小的领域，彼此之间存在不同程度的敌意。也许风暴巨人有自己的领域，云巨人有他们的领地，火巨人有他们的，依此类推。或者可能存在不同的领域，所有这些领域都包括多种类型的巨人。",
	"{@b What's the place of Humanoids?} Perhaps the giants view themselves as stewards of the world, whose divinely appointed role is to protect and uplift the smaller peoples, and Humanoids live in the realms of giants as valued citizens. Or maybe Humanoids are new arrivals on the world, and the first intrepid adventurers are trying to carve out a place for their peoples in a hostile world. Humanoids might enjoy comfortable positions in some realms (particularly those ruled by cloud or storm giants) and be subjugated or hunted in other realms. Humanoids might align themselves (voluntarily or otherwise) with different giant kinds, allowing the giants of the ordning to serve as patrons or adversaries.": "{@b What's the place of Humanoids?} 或许巨人们视自己为世界的守护者，其神圣使命是保护和提升较小种族，而人形生物则作为受尊敬的公民生活在巨人的领域中。或者人形生物是世界上的新来者，而第一批勇敢的冒险者正在试图在这个充满敌意的世界中为自己的种族开辟一片地盘。在一些领域中（尤其是由云巨人或风暴巨人统治的领域），人形生物可能会享有舒适的地位，而在其他领域中可能会被征服或猎杀。人形生物可能会（自愿或被迫）与不同种类的巨人结盟，使得等级制度中的巨人可以成为赞助人或对手。",
	"{@b What's the role of dragons?} In the Forgotten Realms and Eberron, ancient giants warred with dragons for control over the young world. Maybe in your setting, giants won a similar war, driving dragons into obscurity or even extinction. Perhaps such a war is still raging. Dragons might have their own realms alongside the nations of giants, coexisting in peace or in rising tension punctuated by occasional skirmishes. Alternatively, giants and dragons might have worked together to quash any opposition to their dominance over the world.": "在被遗忘的国度和艾伯隆(`Eberron`)中，古代巨人与龙为了控制这个年轻的世界而进行了战争。也许在你的设定中，巨人赢得了类似的战争，将龙族逐渐推向了黯然失色甚至灭绝的境地。也许这样的战争仍在继续。龙可能拥有自己的领域，与巨人国家并存，和平共处或者在偶尔的小规模冲突中紧张地相处。另一种可能是，巨人和龙可能合作，消灭任何反对他们对世界统治的势力。",
	"{@b What's the role of the giants' gods?} With the giants ruling the world as Annam intended, perhaps the All-Father hasn't turned his back on his children. He might be a much more active deity here, and giants might be more engaged in his worship and service. Or perhaps the giants rebuilt their ancient empire with the help of other powers, such as Elemental Evils, demon lords, or the dragon gods.": "{@b What's the role of the giants' gods?} 随着巨人们按照安南的意愿统治世界，也许全父并没有背弃他的子民。在这里，他可能是一个更加活跃的神明，而巨人们可能更积极地参与他的崇拜和服务。或者巨人们在其他力量的帮助下重建了他们的古代帝国，比如元素邪恶、恶魔领主或者龙神。",
	"You can also build a campaign that puts the focus on the world inhabited by the giants of old, which might or might not include a significant number of living giants. The core idea of such a campaign might be that giants dominate the history of the world, so they are responsible for all the ancient sites, magic, and treasures that populate your adventures.": "你也可以打造一个以古代巨人居住的世界为重点的冒险。这个世界可能会有大量现存的巨人，也可能没有。这样一个冒险的核心理念可能是巨人主宰了世界的历史，因此他们负责创造了你冒险中所遇到的所有古代遗迹、魔法和宝藏。",
	"A campaign built on this idea might have a post-apocalyptic feel, as Humanoids spread and begin to explore the ruins of a world destroyed by giants. Or the giants' empires might be an ancient mystery, totally forgotten in the modern world until an ancient site and its treasures are discovered and history is rewritten.": "建立在这个想法基础上的活动可能具有一种末日后的感觉，因为人形生物开始蔓延并开始探索被巨人摧毁的世界的废墟。或者巨人的帝国可能是一个古老的谜团，在现代世界完全被遗忘，直到一个古代遗址及其宝藏被发现，历史被重新书写。",
	"The dungeons and ruins adventurers explore might all be places built by giants. Some might instead be strongholds built by giants' enemies, such as underground fortresses where dwarves sheltered against giants' attacks. If exploring giant-sized dungeons is the norm, characters are likely prepared for climbing huge stairs and navigating other challenges of giant-sized locations (see {@book chapter 4|BGG|4}).": "冒险者探索的地牢和废墟可能都是由巨人建造的地方。有些地方可能是由巨人的敌人建造的据点，比如矮人在地下堡垒中躲避巨人的攻击。如果探索巨人大小的地牢是常态，角色可能已经准备好爬上巨大的楼梯和应对其他巨人大小地点的挑战（见{@book chapter 4|BGG|4}）。",
	"D&D worlds often assume some magic items (especially artifacts) were created in ancient times using long-forgotten techniques. You might decide such items in your campaign were made either by giants or by those who warred against giants. Magic items made by giants might magically adjust to fit smaller peoples, or skilled artisans might have learned techniques to alter these items. {@book Chapter 5|BGG|5} offers more information and suggestions concerning magic items and other treasures crafted by giants.": "D&D世界通常假设一些魔法物品（尤其是神器）是在古代使用被遗忘的技术制造的。你可以决定你的冒险中这些物品是由巨人制造的，或者是由与巨人对抗的人制造的。由巨人制造的魔法物品可能会在魔法上自动调整以适应较小的种族，或者熟练的工匠可能已经学会了改变这些物品的技术。{@book Chapter 5|BGG|5}提供了关于由巨人制作的魔法物品和其他宝藏的更多信息和建议。",
	"If you don't want to build a world that focuses on the presence or absence of giants, you can instead build a campaign around world-shaking events that are instigated by giants. {@adventure Storm King's Thunder|SKT} is an example: the events of this campaign-length adventure are set in motion by Annam's suspension of the ordning and by the scheming among the daughters of a storm giant king. Similar events might mark the start, middle, or end of a campaign as the actions of giants shake the world.": "如果你不想建立一个以巨人的存在或缺失为重点的世界，你可以选择围绕着由巨人引发的世界动荡事件来构建一个冒险活动。{@adventure Storm King's Thunder|SKT} 是一个例子：这个冒险活动的事件是由安南暂停秩序和风暴巨人国王的女儿们之间的阴谋所引发的。类似的事件可能标志着冒险活动的开始、中间或结束，因为巨人的行动会撼动世界。",

	"In the mythic history of most D&D worlds, giants occupy a privileged place—alongside dragons—among the first sapient creatures to walk the earth. Elves and dwarves arose or arrived on most worlds later, and other peoples are generally considered by these ancient folk to be younger in terms of the history of these worlds. Considering the relationships among these ancients—both in history and in their current form—can be an interesting way to develop a campaign that prominently features giants.": "在大多数D&D世界的神话历史中，巨人（(Giants)）与龙一样，在第一批走上这片土地的有智慧生物中占据着特殊的地位。精灵和矮人通常在之后的时间里出现或抵达大多数世界，而其他种族在这些古老种族看来，从历史角度来看都算是年轻的。考虑这些古老种族之间的关系——无论是在历史上还是在他们当前的形态中——可以是一个有趣的方式来开展一个以巨人为主题的冒险活动。",
	"The history of the giants and these other ancient peoples doesn't need to be important in your world, but it might have long-lasting implications. In the Forgotten Realms, giants and dragons sometimes nurse grudges against each other stemming from the Thousand-Year War that devastated their ancient empires millennia ago. Even for such long-lived creatures, twenty-five thousand years is a long time to hold a grudge. In your world, there might never have been conflict between giants and dragons, or they might have long ago set aside any lingering resentment. Perhaps giants and dragons banded together in ages past in a desperate effort to survive the rise of younger peoples. Or evil giants might have sided with chromatic dragons while good giants took up arms alongside metallic dragons in the long-running conflict between the children of Bahamut and the children of Tiamat.": "巨人和其他古代种族的历史在你的世界中可能并不重要，但它可能会产生长远的影响。在被遗忘的国度中，巨人和龙有时会彼此怀恨在心，源自数千年前摧毁了它们古代帝国的千年战争。即使对于这些长寿的生物来说，25000年也是一个漫长的怨恨时间。在你的世界中，巨人和龙之间可能从未发生过冲突，或者他们可能早已放下了任何残留的怨恨。也许巨人和龙在过去的时代曾联合起来，拼命抵抗年轻种族的崛起。或者邪恶的巨人可能会与彩色龙结盟，而善良的巨人则会与金属龙并肩作战，在巴哈姆特之子和提阿玛特之子之间长期的冲突中。",
	"Similarly, many D&D worlds feature an ancient history of conflict between dwarves and giants. This enmity is visible most clearly in certain magic items originally made by dwarves to be highly effective against giants (and other creatures of the Giant type): the {@item dwarven thrower}, {@item Whelm}, and the {@item Axe of the Dwarvish Lords}. Often this history of conflict is assumed to be simply a matter of fighting over territory, since both dwarves and giants often prefer to live in mountainous regions. But the myths told by both giants and dwarves on some worlds describe the conflict extending into the divine realms as well. The god Moradin, who is revered by many dwarves, is said to loathe the evil giant gods. But you might decide the dwarves and giants of your world have a long history of friendly relations, or that dwarves often side with good giants in opposition to the schemes and depredations of evil giants. Perhaps dwarves are frequently the subjects of giant-ruled realms in the mountains, living peaceful and prosperous lives under beneficent storm giant rulers or toiling in poverty under fire giant tyrants.": "同样地，许多D&D世界都展示了矮人和巨人之间古老的冲突历史。这种敌意最清晰地体现在某些魔法物品上，这些物品最初是由矮人制造的，对抗巨人（以及其他巨人类型的生物）非常有效：{@item dwarven thrower}，{@item Whelm}和{@item Axe of the Dwarvish Lords}。通常，这种冲突历史被认为仅仅是为了争夺领土，因为矮人和巨人通常更喜欢生活在山区。但在一些世界上，巨人和矮人讲述的神话描述了冲突延伸到神圣领域。被许多矮人崇敬的神明莫拉丁据说憎恶邪恶的巨人神。但你可以决定你的世界中矮人和巨人有着悠久的友好关系，或者矮人经常与善良的巨人一起对抗邪恶巨人的阴谋和掠夺。也许在山区，矮人经常是由风巨人统治的领域的居民，生活在仁慈的风巨人统治者下过着和平繁荣的生活，或者在火巨人暴君统治下贫困地劳作。",
	"Most D&D worlds' histories don't include any particular animosity between elves and giants. Perhaps in your world, elves and giants have coexisted peacefully in separate regions of the world. Or maybe they warred fiercely: an {@item elven thrower|BGG} (a spear that is otherwise identical to a {@item dwarven thrower} warhammer) might be a magic relic of those ancient battles. Perhaps elves and giants worked together to bring an end to evil dragons' dominion over the young world, and the two peoples maintain a sense of mutual respect.": "在大多数D&D世界的历史中，并没有特别强调精灵和巨人之间的敌意。也许在你的世界里，精灵和巨人在世界的不同地区和平共存。或者也可能它们曾激烈交战：一个{@item elven thrower|BGG}（一把在其他方面与{@item dwarven thrower}战锤相同的长矛）可能是那些古老战斗的魔法遗物。也许精灵和巨人曾共同努力结束邪恶龙对年轻世界的统治，这两个种族保持着相互尊重的感觉。",
	"You might also decide to create a campaign where the conflicts among the ancients, like the Thousand-Year War between giants and dragons in the Forgotten Realms, are not a matter of ancient history but a present reality. You could build an entire campaign in the shadow of such a conflict, which is basically taking the ideas described under \"{@book Clash of Titans|BGG|3|Clash of Titans}\" earlier in this chapter and extending them through many adventures.": "你也可以决定创建一个冒险活动，其中古代的冲突，比如《被遗忘的国度》中巨人和龙之间的千年战争，并不是古代历史的问题，而是当下的现实。你可以在这样的冲突阴影下构建整个冒险活动，基本上是通过许多冒险来延伸本章前面描述的在“{@book Clash of Titans|BGG|3|Clash of Titans}”下的想法。",
	"The war might not be a simple two-sided conflict between giants and dragons. Perhaps elves, dwarves, good giants, and metallic dragons joined forces against a two-pronged assault from evil giants and chromatic dragons. Or war might be raging between dragons and elves while giants strive to protect smaller peoples from the fallout.": "战争可能不仅仅是巨人和龙之间简单的双方冲突。也许精灵、矮人、善良的巨人和金属龙联合起来对抗邪恶巨人和彩虹龙的双面进攻。或者战争可能是在龙和精灵之间肆虐，而巨人努力保护较小种族免受后果的影响。",
	"Other peoples and monsters might be involved. The war might be a largely subterranean clash between stone giants and mind flayers while dwarves and drow seek to escape the earth-shaking and cavern-collapsing aftershocks of battles. Or storm giants might combat krakens and other nightmares of the deep while coastal cities and merchant ships struggle to endure devastating storms and tidal waves.": "其他人类和怪物可能会参与其中。这场战争可能是石巨人和（Mind Flayers）之间的地下冲突，而矮人和（Drow）则试图逃离战斗后的震撼和洞穴坍塌。或者风暴巨人可能会与（Krakens）和其他深海噩梦作战，而沿海城市和商船则努力忍受毁灭性的风暴和海啸。",
	"The Thousand-Year War in the Forgotten Realms lasted a thousand years for good reason: neither giants nor dragons were ever particularly numerous, and actual skirmishes between giants and dragons were rare. For this reason, you could run a campaign where battles between the warring parties are isolated events along the lines of the world-shaking events described in \"{@book Campaign Events|BGG|3|Campaign Events}.\" You might begin the campaign with one such battle, have the adventurers spend months or even years dealing with the aftereffects of the cataclysmic battle, then send your campaign in a new direction with a second battle. Maybe a third, truly cataclysmic battle—in which the adventurers are now high enough level to participate in the combat and turn it in favor of one side or the other—brings the campaign to a close.": "在被遗忘的国度中，千年战争持续了一千年并非没有原因：巨人和龙都从未特别众多，巨人和龙之间的实际冲突也很少见。因此，你可以运行一场战役，其中交战双方之间的战斗是类似于\"(魔戒)\"中描述的世界动荡事件的孤立事件。你可以开始战役时设定一场这样的战斗，让冒险者花费数月甚至数年来处理灾难性战斗的后果，然后通过第二场战斗将你的战役引向新的方向。也许第三场，真正灾难性的战斗——在这场战斗中，冒险者们已经升到足够高的等级参与战斗，并将其转变为对其中一方有利的结果——将战役画上句号。",
	"Another approach to making giants a significant part of your campaign is to feature them in the mythology of your world. {@book Scions of giants' gods|BGG|6|Scions of Giants' Gods} (see {@book chapter 6|BGG|6}) might feature prominently in these myths, as these examples illustrate.": "让巨人成为你战役中重要角色的另一种方法是将它们融入到你世界的神话中。{@book Scions of giants' gods|BGG|6|Scions of Giants' Gods} (见{@book chapter 6|BGG|6}) 可能在这些神话中占据重要地位，正如这些例子所说明的那样。",
	"Giants stole secrets of knowledge and magic from the gods and shared them with Humanoids, thus helping the smaller folk build their first civilizations. For that crime, the giants have endured millennia of punishment at the hands of petty and vengeful gods. Some giants blame Humanoids for causing this punishment, but others still view helping and teaching smaller peoples as their responsibility. (Alternatively, maybe the giants were responsible for teaching Humanoids the evil use of magic and were justly punished for that sin.)": "巨人从众神那里窃取了知识和魔法的秘密，并与人形生物分享，帮助这些较小的民族建立了他们的第一个文明。因此，巨人遭受了千年的惩罚，这是由小心眼和复仇心切的神灵所加诸的。一些巨人责怪人形生物导致了这种惩罚，但另一些仍然认为帮助和教导较小的族群是他们的责任。 (或者，也许巨人负责教导人形生物邪恶地使用魔法，并因此而受到了应有的惩罚。)",
	"Whether it's recorded in revered myth, passed on as casual folklore, or simply fact, giants shaped the landscape in the earliest days of the world. Gigantic boulders scattered across a rolling moor weren't deposited by receding glaciers—they were dropped (or intentionally placed) by giants. A great canyon wasn't worn away by eons of erosion; it was formed when a tired giant dragged her axe behind her after a long day of hewing trees (or dragons). The basalt columns visible at low tide connecting an island to the mainland aren't the result of volcanic activity but rather the craft of ancient giants. A crater or lake might be the place where an ancient giant stepped, slept, or fell after trying to climb the stars to reach Annam's palace. Elemental magic might linger in these places, making them likely locations for dungeons or monster lairs. Carefully sifting through these tales and plotting the locations on a map might reveal the path some ancient giant walked across the land, pointing to the location of a great mystery at the beginning or end of that journey.": "无论是被记录在受尊崇的神话中，作为随意传说流传，还是事实，巨人在世界的最早时期塑造了景观。散布在起伏的沼泽地上的巨大巨石并非是由消退的冰川沉积而成——它们是巨人丢弃（或故意放置）的。一条巨大的峡谷并非是经过亿万年的侵蚀而被磨损的；而是当一位疲惫的巨人在砍伐树木（或龙）的漫长一天后，拖着她的斧头在身后拖出的。在退潮时可见的玄武岩柱并非是火山活动的结果，而是古代巨人的手艺。一个火山口或湖泊可能是一位古代巨人踏过、睡过，或者在试图攀登星星到达安南宫殿后跌倒的地方。元素魔法可能会在这些地方停留，使它们成为地牢或怪物巢穴的可能位置。仔细筛选这些传说并在地图上标出这些位置，可能会揭示一些古代巨人穿过大地的路径，指向这段旅程的开始或结束处的一个伟大谜团的位置。",
	"In a world that is fundamentally inhospitable to life, giants are responsible for maintaining small areas where Humanoids can flourish. Perhaps storm and cloud giants control the weather to maintain small gardens of comfortable temperatures amid a world-spanning desert or frozen wasteland. The campaign might explore what happens to the inhabitants of one of these gardens when its giant caretaker falls ill or dies. Or the gardens might be the stuff of legend in a harsh world where the bravest explorers dare to search for them.": "在一个基本上对生命不友好的世界中，巨人们负责维护一些小区域，让人形生物可以茁壮成长。也许风暴巨人和云巨人控制天气，维持着世界范围的沙漠或冰冻荒野中温暖舒适的小花园。这个冒险故事可能探讨当这些花园中的巨人看护者生病或去世时，花园里的居民会发生什么。或者这些花园可能是严酷世界中传说的一部分，只有最勇敢的探险家才敢去寻找它们。",
	"Six scions of giants' gods literally hold the world together. Perhaps they're responsible for holding the continents above the ocean surface or supporting the dome of the sky, or they might keep the world together through magical means. In any case, if these titans were killed, the world would dissolve into the Elemental Chaos. ({@book Giants of the Worldroot Circle|BGG|2|Worldroot Circle}, described in {@book chapter 2|BGG|2}, might be responsible for protecting these scions.)": "六位巨神之神的后裔实际上维系着世界的稳定。也许他们负责将大陆悬浮在海洋表面上或支撑着天穹，或者通过魔法手段将世界维持在一起。无论如何，如果这些泰坦被杀死，世界将会溶解于元素混沌之中。({@book chapter 2|BGG|2})中描述的{@book Giants of the Worldroot Circle|BGG|2|Worldroot Circle}可能负责保护这些后裔。",
	"Though Annam granted her wish for divinity, Diancastra still roams the worlds of the Material Plane, continuing the whimsical adventures told in numerous sagas. She is a trickster figure whose curiosity, acquisitiveness, and wanderlust constantly get her into sticky situations—and whose cleverness and occasional exertion of giant strength always get her out of those situations. Though she often appears disguised as a young storm giant, she can just as easily appear as a human, elf, or gnome, making her true identity almost impossible to discern. She enjoys a variety of worldly pleasures and delights in the company of mortal creatures of all kinds. She loves to learn more spells, preferring spells of the enchantment and illusion schools.": "尽管安南（Annam）赋予了她成为神灵的愿望，迪安卡斯特拉（Diancastra）仍然漫游在物质位面的世界中，继续在众多传说中讲述的奇幻冒险。她是一个诡计多端的人物，好奇心、贪婪和旅行的欲望经常让她陷入困境，而她的聪明和偶尔展现的巨人力量总是让她摆脱困境。尽管她经常伪装成年轻的风暴巨人，但她同样可以变成人类、精灵或侏儒，使她的真实身份几乎不可能被识破。她喜欢各种世俗的快乐，并喜欢与各种凡间生物为伍。她喜欢学习更多的法术，更偏爱附魔和幻术学派的法术。",
	"Though her exploits seem to serve only her own desires, Diancastra does have a greater agenda: to convince Annam to emerge from his seclusion and restore the giants to their rightful place at the pinnacle of the created order. Adventurers who get caught up in her schemes might eventually have a hand in bringing about Annam's return—or preventing it!": "尽管她的冒险似乎只为了满足自己的欲望，(Diancastra) 的确有一个更大的目标：说服(Annam)走出隐居，将巨人们恢复到被创造秩序的巅峰位置。卷入她阴谋的冒险者最终可能会在(Annam)的回归或阻止回归中发挥作用！",
	"The world has six scions of giants' gods, near-divine titans who are sleeping until Annam awakens them. Their slumbering forms define the terrain features of a certain region of the world (or perhaps up to six regions if they are dispersed around the world). A prophecy suggests a means by which they might be awakened early, leading to the destruction of the world.": "世界上有六位巨人之神的传人，这些近乎神圣的泰坦正在沉睡，直到安南唤醒他们。他们沉睡的形态定义了世界某个地区（或者如果他们分散在世界各地，可能是多达六个地区）的地形特征。一项预言暗示了一种可能提前唤醒他们的方式，从而导致世界的毁灭。",
	"At the center of the world is an enormous mountain that is the ancestral home of this world's giants. The mountain vertically embodies the ordning, from the foothills to the churning storm that perpetually roils above its sky-high peak. The giants were banished from this mountain in ancient times, and scions of giants' gods, angels, devils, or some other supernatural guardians watch over the place to make sure the giants don't return before Annam gives them leave. What secrets of the world's creation and ancient history are hidden in this mythic place?": "世界中心是一座巨大的山，是这个世界巨人的祖先之家。这座山从山麓到永远翻腾在高耸的山峰上方的风暴中，垂直地体现了等级制度。古代时期，巨人被驱逐出这座山，而巨人之神的后裔、天使、恶魔或其他一些超自然守护者守护着这个地方，以确保在安纳姆允许之前巨人不会返回。这个神秘之地隐藏着世界创世和古代历史的哪些秘密？",
	"When I set my mind on creating a lasting legacy, I asked Diancastra to help me find a place where I could craft an item with the power I had in mind. She brought me to the Star Forge.": "当我下定决心创造一个永恒的遗产时，我请求(Diancastra)帮助我找到一个地方，在那里我可以打造一个符合我设想力量的物品。她带我来到了(Star Forge)。",
	"This chapter, intended for the Dungeon Master, presents giant enclaves—locations created by giants, controlled by them, or otherwise stemming from giants and their magic. Each section contains a map of the giant enclave, a description of the enclave's features and wondrous properties, and adventure ideas.": "这一章节是为地下城主（(Dungeon Master)）准备的，介绍了巨人聚居地——这些地点是由巨人创造、控制或以其他方式与巨人及其魔法有关。每个部分都包括一个巨人聚居地的地图、对该聚居地特征和奇妙属性的描述，以及冒险点子。",
	"The chapter includes the following giant enclaves:": "本章包括以下巨型飞地：",
	"Each of the locations in this chapter is a blank slate; you can decide who lives there, what they want, and how they interact with visitors. Each location includes a selection of adventure hooks that might attract characters to the enclave or give them a reason to draw on its magic. The adventure hooks also suggest specific creatures or encounter tables appearing in the \"{@book Encounters|BGG|3|Encounters}\" section in {@book chapter 3|BGG|3}. And several of these hooks point to other enclaves, creating paths to string locations together into larger adventures.": "本章中的每个地点都是一块空白的板；你可以决定谁住在那里，他们想要什么，以及他们如何与访客互动。每个地点都包括一些冒险钩子的选择，这些钩子可能会吸引角色前往飞地，或者给他们一个理由利用其魔法。冒险钩子还建议在{@book chapter 3|BGG|3}中出现的特定生物或遭遇表，以及在{@book Encounters|BGG|3|Encounters}部分中出现的特定生物或遭遇表。而其中几个钩子指向其他飞地，创造了将各个地点串联成更大冒险的路径。",
	"When developing these enclaves into adventure sites, let your imagination run wild. Mix and match different encounter tables to see what can arise. Consider how randomly determining the attitude of the creatures generated can shift the tone of a story. If a hostile giant is the driving force behind an adventure seed, how does the adventure change if that giant is indifferent or even friendly to the characters?": "在将这些飞地发展成冒险场所时，让你的想象力奔放。混合和匹配不同的遭遇表，看看会发生什么。考虑随机确定生成生物的态度如何可以改变故事的基调。如果一个敌对的巨人是冒险种子背后的推动力，那么如果那个巨人对角色们漠不关心甚至友好，冒险会发生什么变化？",
	"Locations built, repurposed, or furnished by giants have a grand scale. A giant's castle contains massive thrones, dining tables that could serve as the foundation for a human's home, and cutlery a human army could use as weapons. As a general rule, multiply each dimension of a space or object by three to estimate its giant-sized version, or by four if it's made by cloud or storm giants. Giant-sized locations have the following features:": "由巨人建造、改建或装饰的地点规模宏大。巨人的城堡内有巨大的宝座，餐桌可以作为人类家庭的基础，餐具则可以被人类军队用作武器。一般规则是，将空间或物体的每个尺寸乘以三来估算其巨人大小版本，如果是由云巨人或风暴巨人制造的，则乘以四。巨人大小的地点具有以下特点：",
	"Comfortable ceilings for giants must exceed 20 feet at minimum. Most ceilings are 30 feet high, with luxurious or impressive construction pushing their height to 60 feet or more.": "巨人舒适的天花板高度最低必须超过20英尺。大多数天花板高度为30英尺，豪华或令人印象深刻的建筑将其高度推至60英尺甚至更高。",
	"Door handles are typically 10 to 12 feet off the floor (or half the height of the giants who built them). Large or smaller creatures must reach the handle to unlatch it. Opening a door typically requires one character to operate the latch and another to wrestle the door open. While the handle is unlatched, a creature must use an action to push or pull on the heavy door, opening it with a successful DC 12 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. (Alternatively, you can set the DC to 6 + the Strength modifier of the giants who built the door.) On a failed check, the door doesn't open.": "门把手通常位于离地面10到12英尺的位置（或者是建造它们的巨人身高的一半）。较大或较小的生物必须到达门把手才能打开门。打开一扇门通常需要一个角色操作把手，另一个角色拉开门。当门把手被解锁时，生物必须使用一个动作来推或拉这扇沉重的门，通过成功的DC 12力量检定（{@skill Athletics}）来打开它。（或者，你可以将DC设置为6 +建造门的巨人的力量修正值。）如果检定失败，门就不会打开。",
	"Furnishings and other items in a location made for Huge giants are typically three times the size of human-sized equivalents and roughly twenty-seven times the weight. Medium and smaller creatures can clamber over or scuttle under giant-sized furniture, treating it as {@book difficult terrain|PHB|8|Difficult Terrain}. Such creatures can move normally beneath particularly hefty pieces of giant furniture, such as a 12-foot-tall dining table.": "为巨人制造的家具和其他物品通常比人类尺寸的相当三倍大，重量大约是人类尺寸的27倍。中等和较小的生物可以爬上或在巨人尺寸的家具下躲藏，将其视为{@book difficult terrain|PHB|8|Difficult Terrain}。这些生物可以在特别沉重的巨人家具下正常移动，比如一个12英尺高的餐桌。",

Ladders made for giants, with rungs spaced 3 feet apart, can also be treated as difficult terrain for creatures smaller than Huge.": "巨人制作的台阶高度在1½到3英尺之间。大型和较小生物将这样的楼梯视为艰难地形。为巨人制作的梯子，横梁间距为3英尺，对于小于巨型的生物也可以视为艰难地形。",
	"Giants from an ancient empire created an empowered form of the life rune that channeled Annam the All-Father's raw creative might. The giants sought to create their own world as he once did, and invoked the rune in an immense cavern deep underground, which they named Annam's Cradle.

Also, a magic item might absorb some of the latent elemental power of its giant users or creators.
