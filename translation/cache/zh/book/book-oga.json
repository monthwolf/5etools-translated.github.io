	"Ever since I joined the D&D team in 2010, I've thought about a future where the grung were \"a thing\" again. These long-forgotten amphibians from the 2nd Edition Greyhawk setting had captured my heart and imagination long ago. So, it was with some amount of grit that I entered them into the fray of creatures to be selected as part of Volo's Guide to Monsters. They certainly weren't the favored choice, but in the end when we each received a \"golden ticket\" to give to one creature. Despite jeers from my coworkers, it was clear to me what my choice would be. Grung for life!!!": "自从我在2010年加入D&D团队以来，我一直在想，在未来，grung会再次成为一种 \"东西\"。这些在第二版灰鹰设定中被遗忘已久的两栖动物很久以前就俘获了我的心和想象力。因此，我带着一定的勇气将它们纳入了作为《沃罗怪物指南》一部分的生物阵营。它们当然不是最受欢迎的选择，但最后我们每个人都收到了一张 \"金票\"，可以送给一个生物。尽管同事们嘲笑我，但我很清楚我的选择是什么。",
	"Since then, I was given the opportunity to reimagine them, rewrite them, and include them among creatures that can potentially exist in any D&D campaign setting... and then it happened. Someone asked me to DM a table of players during the Stream of Annihilation. With the ALL-STAR cast of celebrities that would be attending, plus superstar DMs like Chris Perkins and Mike Mearls to follow, I had to find something that would set me apart from the rest... or at least confirm to the world that I'm simply an eccentric goofball... either way sounded great to me. At this point I mused out loud... \"What if my players were ALL grung?\" The rest is history... and the future. You can even watch it on YouTube.": "从那时起，我就有机会重新想象它们，重写它们，并将它们纳入可能存在于任何D&D战役背景中的生物中......然后它就发生了。有人让我在 \"毁灭之流 \"中管理一桌玩家。由于参加会议的名人都是全明星阵容，再加上像克里斯-帕金斯和迈克-梅尔斯这样的超级明星DM，我必须找到一些能让我与其他人不同的东西......或者至少向世界证实我只是一个古怪的傻瓜......无论哪种方式对我来说都很好。在这一点上，我大声地想...... \"如果我的球员都是格格呢？\" 剩下的就是历史......和未来。你甚至可以在YouTube上观看它。",
	"I want to thank these individuals... all fantastic DMs as well, that brought the grung in the Stream of Annihilation game to life.

	"You've all made me a VERY HOPPY DM!": "你们都让我成为一个非常高兴的DM!",
	"As an orange grung, d'Ahten'khan is the highest caste member of the group, and its strategic leader. Not the most studied grung, d'Ahten'khan relied heavily on c'Ahbülos for relevant information and lore, prior to the red grung's untimely demise at the hands of the batiri.": "作为一个橙色的格陵人，德-阿赫坦汗是这个团体的最高种姓成员，也是它的战略领袖。德-阿赫坦汗并不是最善于研究的格伦人，在红色格伦人不幸死于巴蒂里人之手之前，德-阿赫坦汗在很大程度上依赖于克-阿布洛斯的相关信息和传说。",
	"d'Ahten'khan now relies on b'Ang'r'Ang, whom she trusts implicitly with communicating her commands to b'Leep, a green grung scout, and last remaining member of her squad. As b'Leep is well beneath her station d'Ahten'khan will not ever communicate directly with this lower caste grung.": "阿丹汗现在依靠b'Ang'r'Ang，她信任b'Ang'r'Ang将她的命令传达给b'Leep，b'Leep是一个绿色的格陵人侦察员，也是她小队中最后的成员。由于B'Leep的地位远远低于她的地位，所以Ahten'khan不会直接与这个低种姓的grung沟通。",
	"As the leader of a previously successful band of grung, d'Ahten'khan developed aspirations of nobility, and finds it difficult to not overly communicate these to any worthy grung who will listen.": "作为以前成功的格陵兰乐队的首领，达赫坦汗产生了对贵族的渴望，并发现很难不向任何愿意倾听的有价值的格陵兰人过度传达这些。",
	"As a higher caste hunter and purple grung, b'Ang'r'Ang is the tactical, courageous leader and devoted mentor of b'Lip, b'Loop, b'Leep, and b'Lahp. The most conscientious of the group, she bears the burden of responsibility for her green cousins, which previously led to conflict with b'Lip, who prefers to act before thinking.": "作为一个较高种姓的猎人和紫袍人，安格是一个有策略的、勇敢的领导者，也是安格、罗普、利普和拉普的忠实导师。她是这个群体中最认真的人，承担着对她的绿色表兄弟的责任，这以前导致了与b'Lip的冲突，因为他喜欢在思考之前采取行动。",
	"Recognizing her place in the grung hierarchy, b'Ang'r'Ang is responsible for working with the brothers to execute on \"plans\" developed by d'Ahten'khan, who relies upon b'Ang'r'Ang to communicate instructions to the much-lower caste green grung. After a recent batiri goblin ambush where the band of grung scattered to the four winds, the whereabouts of b'Lip, b'Loop, and b'Lahp remain unknown.": "认识到自己在grung等级制度中的地位，b'Ang'r'Ang负责与兄弟们一起执行d'Ahten'khan制定的 \"计划\"，d'Ahten'khan依靠b'Ang'r'Ang向地位更低的绿色grung传达指令。在最近的一次巴蒂里妖精的伏击战中，格伦族人四散奔逃，b'Lip、b'Loop和b'Lahp的下落仍然不明。",
	"One of four nearly identical green grung, b'Leep was raised from an egg alongside his siblings. The grung were trained from hatchlings to be the ultimate band of hunters.": "B'Leep是四个几乎相同的绿色grung中的一个，他和他的兄弟姐妹们一起从蛋中长大。格陵花从孵化开始就被训练成最终的猎手队伍。",
	"Quiet and methodical, b'Leep experiences a greater than average level of anxiety... EVERYWHERE. Constantly on the lookout for the tricks and traps of others, b'Leep has an almost intuitive sense for dealing with strange locks and mechanisms, and is quite knowledgeable about the jungle and its dangers. He is extremely loyal to his siblings and b'Ang'r'Ang.": "安静和有条不紊，B'Leep经历了比平均水平更高的焦虑......。在任何地方都是如此。b'leep一直在注意别人的诡计和陷阱，他对处理奇怪的锁和机制有一种近乎直觉的感觉，而且对丛林和它的危险相当了解。他对他的兄弟姐妹和b'Ang'r'Ang极为忠诚。",
	"A devoted member of the Ytepka Society, Mee'YahGhee spends most of his time occupying various taverns in the Merchant's Ward of Port Nyanzaru, drinking, and generally keeping tabs on goings on in the city in that regard. All manner of folks are willing to talk freely around a drunk albino dwarf that can barely seem to recall his own name.": "作为Ytepka协会的忠实成员，Mee'YahGhee大部分时间都在尼安萨鲁港商区的各种酒馆里喝酒，一般来说，他都会关注这个城市在这方面的情况。各种各样的人都愿意在一个醉醺醺的白化侏儒身边畅所欲言，他似乎几乎记不起自己的名字。",
	"Years ago, during his hermitage, Mee'Yah-Ghee trained the young grung d'Ahtenkhan. As he's heard of the shake up in the hierarchy within her army, Mee'Yah-Ghee has ventured into the jungle to find his student and help her in any way he can.": "多年前，在他的隐居期间，Mee'Yah-Ghee训练了年轻的grung d'Ahtenkhan。由于听说她的军队内部的等级制度发生了动荡，米亚吉冒险进入丛林，寻找他的学生并以任何方式帮助她。",
	"The grung of ONE GRUNG ABOVE are trained to use this new musical instrument. This is a hollow tube with holes cut throughout, much like a flute. You can play music with it for entertainment, but the grung also swing it about by a sturdy cord (attached) to create a sound recognizable by other grung, so they know each other's approximate location. Additionally, grung that know Thieves' Cant can use a whistle stick in this manner to communicate over distance.": "ONE GRUNG ABOVE的grung接受了使用这种新乐器的训练。这是一个空心管，上面有很多孔，很像笛子。你可以用它来演奏音乐，作为娱乐，但格伦人也可以用一根结实的绳子（连着）来摆动它，以创造出其他格伦人可以识别的声音，这样他们就能知道对方的大概位置。此外，懂得 \"盗贼之声 \"的格伦人可以通过这种方式使用哨棒来进行远距离交流。",
	"Your {@race grung|OGA} character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of grung nature.": "你的{@race grung|OGA}角色有各种与生俱来的能力，是grung天性的一部分。",
