	"\"Elegy for the First World\" is an ancient Draconic poem of unknown origin, found with minor variations in the collections and traditions of dragons across many worlds of the Material Plane. Various creation myths told on different worlds echo some of the themes and notions of this poem, particularly when they describe dragons or draconic gods being involved in creating the world. But the heart of the poem is a profound assertion not found in any of those individual myths.": "\"第一世界的挽歌 \"是一首起源不明的古老龙语诗，在物质世界的许多世界的龙的收藏和传统中发现了一些小的变化。不同世界的各种创世神话都呼应了这首诗的一些主题和概念，特别是当它们描述龙或龙神参与创造世界时。但这首诗的核心是一个深刻的论断，在任何一个单独的神话中都找不到。",
	"The elegy suggests that before the myriad worlds of the Material Plane came into being, before Oerth and Toril and Eberron and Krynn existed, the primordial dragons—Bahamut and Tiamat—worked together to create the Material Plane in the form of a single First World. All the worlds that now constitute the plane are, in the words of the poem, \"seedling realities\" formed when the First World was sundered in some unexplained catastrophe.": "这首挽歌表明，在物质世界的无数个世界出现之前，在Oerth和Toril、Eberron和Krynn存在之前，原始龙--Bahamut和Tiamat--一起工作，以单一的第一世界的形式创造了物质世界。用这首诗的话说，现在构成这个平面的所有世界都是第一世界在某种无法解释的灾难中被拆散后形成的 \"幼苗现实\"。",
	"The story told in \"Elegy for the First World\" suggests a number of truths regarding the nature of dragons. First, it portrays the ten varieties of metallic and chromatic dragons as the first inhabitants of the Material Plane. Dragons were made to populate the First World before any other worlds came into being, but they were supplanted by the teeming peoples that the gods of the Outer Planes brought to inhabit that world. The elegy likewise suggests that dragons are living embodiments of the primordial energy of the First World, which now flows throughout the Material Plane, and that they are thus inextricably linked to the magic of that plane. The religions of numerous worlds teach that Humanoids are creatures of a dual nature—part material and part spiritual, made of the essence of both the Material Plane and the otherworldly Outer Planes. But dragons, at least in the view of \"Elegy for the First World,\" are wholly material, dwelling in the Material Plane and embodying its essential nature.": "第一世界的挽歌》中讲述的故事暗示了一些关于龙的本质的真相。首先，它把十种金属龙和彩色龙描绘成物质世界的第一批居民。在其他世界出现之前，龙被制造出来居住在第一世界，但它们被外域诸神带来居住在该世界的众多民族所取代。这首挽歌同样表明，龙是第一世界原始能量的活体化身，这些能量现在流向整个物质界，因此它们与该界的魔法有着不可分割的联系。许多世界的宗教都教导说，人类是具有双重性质的生物--一部分是物质的，一部分是精神的，由物质界和其他世界的外星球的精华组成。但龙，至少在《第一世界的挽歌》看来，完全是物质的，居住在物质界，体现了物质界的基本性质。",
	"Many worlds have myths and legends about Bahamut and Tiamat, though these primordial dragons are sometimes known by other names. But \"Elegy for the First World\" differs from nearly all those legends in its mention of Sardior, \"first-born of dragonkind.\" The poem suggests that Bahamut and Tiamat created Sardior together, and that \"ruby-red\" Sardior then joined with Bahamut to craft the metallic dragons and with Tiamat to craft the chromatic dragons. Some dragons who have studied the poem believe that Sardior was destroyed and shattered along with the First World and that the Ruby Dragon's splintered consciousness became the gem dragons on the new worlds of the Material Plane.": "许多世界都有关于巴哈姆特和提亚马特的神话和传说，尽管这些原始龙有时被称为其他名字。但《第一世界的挽歌》与几乎所有这些传说不同，它提到了 \"龙族的第一个孩子 \"Sardior。这首诗表明，巴哈姆特和提亚马特一起创造了萨尔迪奥，然后 \"红宝石色 \"的萨尔迪奥与巴哈姆特一起制作金属龙，与提亚马特一起制作彩色龙。一些研究过这首诗的龙认为，萨尔迪奥与第一世界一起被摧毁和破碎，红宝石龙分裂的意识成为物质界新世界的宝石龙。",
	"Whether it is regarded as interpretive myth or historical record, \"Elegy for the First World\" offers an explanation for the common elements that appear in the legends and mythology of so many worlds across the Material Plane. Dragons populated the First World from the time of its creation, and a variety of peoples came to live in the First World after their gods made war on the dragons. As such, the similar natures of the creatures now inhabiting the many different worlds of the Material Plane can be seen as a product of the First World's sundering. And because dragons are so tightly linked to the essence of the Material Plane, they are thought to be the only creatures that appear on every world formed from the shattering of the First World, even when they take on different forms.": "无论是被视为解释性的神话还是历史记录，\"第一世界的挽歌 \"都对出现在物质界众多世界的传说和神话中的共同要素做出了解释。龙在第一世界创建之时就已经存在，在他们的神向龙开战之后，各种民族都来到了第一世界生活。因此，现在居住在物质界许多不同世界中的生物的相似性质可以被视为第一世界分裂的产物。由于龙与物质界的本质紧密相连，它们被认为是唯一出现在第一世界破碎后形成的每个世界上的生物，即使它们具有不同的形式。",
	"Legends say the world of Krynn (home to the Dragonlance setting) was created in the interplay between the High God and Chaos. Its most important cosmic powers have always been the three children of the High God—Paladine, Gilean, and Takhisis, with Paladine and Takhisis easily identifiable as Bahamut and Tiamat. According to the creation myths of Krynn, Paladine and Takhisis worked together to create five dragons to rule the world, but Takhisis secretly corrupted them, creating the first five chromatic dragons. Mourning the corruption of his children, Paladine worked with the forge-god Reorx to create the metallic dragons. Much of the history of Krynn involves the strife between Takhisis and Paladine and the ongoing effort to maintain balance between good and evil. Chromatic dragons have long been Takhisis's favored agents as she strives to dominate the world, while metallic dragons have helped the peoples of Krynn to foil her schemes. Meanwhile, Paladine, in the guise of a doddering old wizard named Fizban, walked among the peoples of Krynn to aid them—just as Bahamut has done on many worlds throughout their long histories.": "传说中，克莱恩世界（《龙之谷》背景的所在地）是在高级神和混沌的相互作用下创造的。它最重要的宇宙力量一直是高级神的三个孩子--帕拉丁、吉利安和塔克西丝，其中帕拉丁和塔克西丝很容易被识别为巴哈姆特和提亚马特。根据克莱恩的创世神话，帕拉丁和塔克西丝共同创造了五条龙来统治世界，但塔克西丝暗中腐蚀了它们，创造了第一批五条色龙。帕拉丁为他的孩子们的堕落感到悲哀，他与锻造之神雷奥克斯合作，创造了金属龙。克莱恩的大部分历史都涉及到塔克西丝和帕拉丁之间的纷争，以及为维持善恶平衡所做的持续努力。长期以来，在塔克西丝努力主宰世界的过程中，有色龙一直是她青睐的代理人，而金属龙则帮助克莱恩的人民挫败了她的计划。同时，帕拉丁化身为一个名叫菲兹班的老巫师，在克莱恩的人民中行走，帮助他们--就像巴哈姆特在他们漫长的历史中在许多世界所做的那样。",
	"The myths of Eberron describe the involvement of the three Progenitor Dragons in that world's creation: Siberys, the Dragon Above; Khyber, the Dragon Below; and Eberron, the Dragon Between. These godlike beings are said to have created a microcosm of the multiverse in the depths of the Ethereal Plane, sequestered away from the Outer Planes and all the influence of the gods and other cosmic powers. Viewed through the lens of \"Elegy for the First World,\" Eberron is thus not actually a fragment of the First World, but a second-generation derivative of that original realm—yet even Eberron is profoundly shaped by dragons.": "Eberron的神话描述了三位祖龙在该世界的创造中的参与。Siberys，上面的龙；Khyber，下面的龙；和Eberron，中间的龙。这些神一样的存在据说在虚空界的深处创造了一个多元宇宙的缩影，被封存在远离外部世界和所有诸神和其他宇宙力量的影响之外。从 \"第一世界的哀歌 \"的角度来看，Eberron实际上并不是第一世界的一个片段，而是那个原始领域的第二代衍生物--然而即使Eberron也被龙深深地塑造了。",
	"A little-known phenomenon supports the central ideas expressed in \"Elegy for the First World.\" Occasionally, dragons develop a sense known as dragonsight—an awareness of multiple incarnations of themselves across different worlds of the Material Plane. Dragonsight is most common in ancient dragons, especially when their enormous hoards include items from other worlds or powerful artifacts whose histories span multiple worlds. Gem dragons, perhaps because of their connection to Sardior, are most likely to develop dragonsight.": "一个鲜为人知的现象支持了《第一世界的挽歌》所表达的中心思想。偶尔，龙会发展出一种被称为 \"龙视 \"的意识--对自己在物质世界不同世界中的多种化身的意识。龙眼在古龙中最为常见，尤其是当他们巨大的囤积物包括来自其他世界的物品或历史跨越多个世界的强大文物时。宝石龙，也许是因为它们与萨尔迪奥的关系，最有可能形成龙视。",
	"Dragons who develop dragonsight amass knowledge that spans the Material Plane, making them among the foremost experts on worlds beyond their own. With time, dragonsight can expand beyond passive awareness to allow active communication between a dragon's incarnations. Some ancient dragons with well-developed dragonsight begin to weave grand plans that involve coordinating activities across multiple worlds, culminating in cosmos-shaking events.": "形成龙视的龙积累了跨越物质界的知识，使他们成为超越自身世界的最重要专家之一。随着时间的推移，龙眼可以超越被动的意识，允许龙的化身之间进行主动的交流。一些拥有发达的龙视力的古龙开始制定宏伟的计划，包括协调多个世界的活动，最终导致震惊世界的事件。",
	"Given most people's limited understanding of dragons' beliefs and philosophies, let alone dragonsight, many mortals are quick to describe dragons with heightened dragonsight as \"dragon gods\"—which they are not. Still, some powerful dragons have so successfully extended their consciousness across multiple incarnations, and so expertly coordinated their activities across multiple worlds, that they can seem godlike even to younger dragons. The {@creature black greatwyrm|FTD} Chronepsis once accomplished a feat similar to Ashardalon's, with one version of the dragon devouring multiple echoes before leaving the Material Plane and establishing a lair in the Outer Planes.": "鉴于大多数人对龙的信仰和哲学了解有限，更不用说龙眼了，许多凡人很快就把拥有高度龙眼的龙描述为 \"龙神\"--其实他们并不是。然而，一些强大的龙已经成功地将他们的意识扩展到多个化身，并如此熟练地协调他们在多个世界的活动，以至于他们甚至在年轻的龙看来都像神一样。{@creature black greatwyrm|FTD}Chronepsis曾经完成了与Ashardalon类似的壮举，其中一个版本的龙在离开物质世界并在外部世界建立一个巢穴之前吞噬了多个回声。",
	"Just as individual dragons have echoes across multiple worlds of the Material Plane, some places of tremendous power that have a connection to dragons resonate across the plane. Dungeons such as the Sunless Citadel (buried by Ashardalon in his wrath), Dragon Mountain (the lair of the red dragon Infyrana), and the ruined city of Xak Tsaroth (home to the black dragon Khisanth) manifest in various ways across multiple worlds. Similarly, the power of mighty dragonslayers often resonates around sites they build or inhabit. The Tomb of Horrors is one such site, crafted by the lich Acererak, whose uncountable evils included slaughtering metallic dragons for the magic of their blood.": "就像个别龙在物质界的多个世界中都有回声一样，一些与龙有关的具有巨大力量的地方也会在整个物质界产生共鸣。诸如无日城堡（Ashardalon在愤怒中被埋葬）、龙山（红龙Infyrana的巢穴）和废墟城市Xak Tsaroth（黑龙Khisanth的家）等地下城以不同的方式在多个世界显现。同样地，强大的屠龙者的力量经常在他们建造或居住的场所周围产生共鸣。恐怖之墓就是这样一个地方，它是由巫师阿克雷拉克（Acerererak）建造的，他数不清的恶行包括屠杀金属龙以获取其血液的魔法。",
	"From the folk hero dreaming of liberating their people from a tyrannical blue dragon's reign to the idealistic acolyte who imagines purging the world of Tiamat's corruption, many adventurers aspire to be dragonslayers. In time, some have their dreams realized—or shattered in spectacular fashion, as they discover they are woefully unprepared for the threat a dragon poses.": "从梦想将自己的人民从暴虐的蓝龙统治下解放出来的民间英雄，到幻想将世界从提亚马特的腐败中清除的理想主义信徒，许多冒险家都渴望成为屠龙者。随着时间的推移，一些人实现了他们的梦想，或者以壮观的方式粉碎了他们的梦想，因为他们发现自己对龙的威胁完全没有准备。",
	"This chapter is for any D&D character who hopes or fears that they might one day face a dragon. But this chapter is also for the bard who has made a lifelong study of dragonsong, the cleric devoted to Bahamut, and the warlock who made an eldritch pact with a moonstone dragon. For dragons are not always adversaries. They can be patrons, allies, and benefactors; they can scheme in the shadows; and they can dramatically shape adventurers' lives.": "本章适用于任何希望或担心有一天会面对龙的D&D角色。但本章也适用于终生研究龙歌的吟游诗人、献身于巴哈姆特的牧师以及与月石龙达成长生契约的术士。因为龙并不总是对手。它们可以是赞助人、盟友和恩人；它们可以在阴影中策划；它们可以极大地塑造冒险者的生活。",

A hoard item in its Slumbering state has certain base properties, and it gains additional properties when it enters the Stirring, Wakened, or Ascendant state.": "某些魔法物品可以吸收龙的囤积物的环境魔法。龙越强大，当它浸泡在龙的囤积物中时，物品就越强大。这些物品被称为 \"囤积物品\"，它们有四种状态，在 \"囤积物品状态 \"表中有所总结。处于沉睡状态的囤积物有一定的基本属性，当它进入搅动、唤醒或上升状态时，它将获得额外的属性。",

	"Ordinarily, a hoard item must steep in a dragon's hoard for 1 year to reach the maximum possible state allowed by the age of the hoard's dragon, as shown on the Hoard Item States table. For example, a hoard item that steeps in a young dragon's hoard for 1 year enters its Stirring state, while one that steeps in an ancient dragon's hoard for 1 year reaches the pinnacle of its power and enters its Ascendant state. If there are one or more hoard items steeping in a dragon's hoard, the dragon is aware of them. The dragon also knows what these hoard items are and what state (Slumbering, Stirring, Wakened, or Ascendant) each of them is in.": "通常情况下，一个囤积物必须在龙的囤积物中浸泡1年才能达到囤积物的龙的年龄所允许的最大状态，如囤积物状态表所示。例如，一个囤积物在年轻的龙的囤积物中浸泡1年就会进入搅拌状态，而在古老的龙的囤积物中浸泡1年就会达到其力量的顶峰，进入上升状态。如果有一个或多个囤积物浸泡在龙的囤积物中，龙就会知道它们。龙也知道这些囤积物是什么，以及它们各自所处的状态（沉睡、搅动、觉醒或上升）。",
	"When a dragon is slain, the magic surrounding its hoard becomes volatile. This allows a hoard item to steep more quickly in the hoard. A hoard item steeped in a dragon's hoard for 8 hours rises one state (from Slumbering to Stirring, Stirring to Wakened, or Wakened to Ascendant), as long as the steeping begins within 1 hour of the dragon's death and occurs within the dragon's lair. Steeping in this way can't raise the state of the item beyond the state associated with the dragon's age—putting a Wakened item in a slain adult dragon's hoard does not make it Ascendant, for example.": "当龙被杀时，围绕其囤积物的魔法变得不稳定。这允许一个囤积物在囤积物中更快地浸泡。在龙的囤积物中浸泡8小时后，只要在龙死后1小时内开始浸泡并发生在龙的巢穴中，囤积物就会上升一个状态（从沉睡到搅拌，搅拌到唤醒，或唤醒到上升）。以这种方式浸泡不能使物品的状态超过与龙的年龄相关的状态--例如，将已觉醒的物品放入被杀的成年龙的囤积物中并不能使其升天。",
	"Just as hoard items can grow in power by absorbing the ambient magic of a dragon's hoard, so too can these treasures fall back into slumber. If no creature is attuned to a hoard item and that item isn't in a dragon's hoard, the item decreases in power by one state every 30 days until it is Slumbering.": "就像囤积物品可以通过吸收龙的囤积物的环境魔法来增长力量一样，这些宝物也可以重新陷入沉睡。如果没有生物与囤积物品相适应，并且该物品不在龙的囤积物中，那么该物品的力量每30天减少一个状态，直到它陷入沉睡。",

	"As described in {@book chapter 3|FTD|3|Death of a Dragon}, the death of a dragon can result in its power taking root in a character, whether that person is the dragon's chosen heir or the dragon's killer.

	"Sometimes, a draconic gift has an obvious visual manifestation, such as when a character is transformed into a dragonborn. Other gifts are invisible, but no less potent. But on some worlds, the investiture of draconic power is accompanied by some kind of physical manifestation, especially if it's derived from slaying a dragon. It might be small and easily hidden, but those who know to look can usually identify a dragonslayer (or another character who carries a draconic gift) by a telltale sign. The Draconic Marks table suggests some possibilities of what these marks might look like.": "有时，龙族的天赋会有明显的视觉表现，例如当一个角色变成龙族时。其他的天赋是看不见的，但其威力也不小。但在一些世界上，龙族力量的注入会伴随着某种物理表现，尤其是当它来自于屠龙。它可能很小，也很容易隐藏，但那些知道要看的人通常可以通过一个明显的标志来识别一个屠龙者（或其他携带龙族天赋的角色）。屠龙记号表显示了这些记号可能出现的一些可能性。",

Ingeloakastimizilian is Icingdeath, Imvaernarhro is Inferno, and K'rshinthintl and Claugiyliamatar are called Cyan Bloodbane and Old Gnawbones, respectively.": "许多龙的绰号和外号更出名。Klauth通常被称为Old Snarl，而Khellendros则被记为Skie和Krynn上空的风暴。英格罗阿卡斯蒂米兹利安是冰冻死神，伊姆瓦纳赫罗是地狱之神，而克尔辛特尔和克劳吉利阿玛塔尔则分别被称为青色血刃和老啃骨者。",
	"When naming a dragon, take whatever approach appeals to you. But bear in mind that dragons need memorable names, and if you or your players have trouble pronouncing a name, it's likely to be quickly forgotten—or jokingly abbreviated.": "给龙起名时，采取任何吸引你的方法。但请记住，龙需要令人难忘的名字，如果你或你的玩家在发音上有困难，它很可能很快就会被遗忘，或者被开玩笑地缩写。",
	"The Dragon Name Elements table provides Draconic morphemes that appear in dragon names. You can combine these elements to form a dragon name. For each element, roll a {@dice d20}, then choose one of the four possible results from the table, or roll a {@dice d4} to determine which column to choose from. If you like, you can rearrange these elements and add or drop letters to create a smoother flow or a more dramatic sound. For nicknames, look for inspiration in the dragon's abilities, mannerisms, or most famous acts.": "龙名元素表提供了龙名中出现的Draconic语素。你可以将这些元素组合起来，形成一个龙的名字。对于每个元素，先掷一个{@dice d20}，然后从表中的四个可能结果中选择一个，或者掷一个{@dice d4}来决定从哪一栏中选择。如果你喜欢，你可以重新排列这些元素，并增加或减少字母，以创造一个更流畅的流程或更戏剧性的声音。对于绰号，可以从龙的能力、举止或最著名的行为中寻找灵感。",

A dragon who innately casts druid spells feels different from one who casts warlock spells.

If adult dragons are rearing a clutch of wyrmlings, the younger dragons often divide the adults' territory among them. A single wyrmling might thus hunt an area covering only a few square miles, but the presence of one wyrmling indicates that more might be nearby. On the other hand, wyrmlings without adult dragons in their lives might become allies or as captives of other kinds of creatures. Such wyrmlings are more likely to be scattered from their nest mates.": "食人龙最常考虑的是地方规模--不超过几个农庄或村庄可能覆盖的区域。如果成年龙正在养育一窝小龙，年轻的龙通常会把成年龙的领地分给它们。因此，一只小龙可能只猎杀几平方英里的区域，但一只小龙的存在表明附近可能有更多的小龙。另一方面，没有成年龙的wyrmlings可能会成为盟友或作为其他种类生物的俘虏。这样的巫妖更有可能从它们的巢穴伴侣中分散出去。",

	"This stage is when most dragons first establish their own territory and lair. A young dragon's territory covers an area about 50 miles across. This is also when dragons start to form the magical ties that bind them to both their hoards and the regions around their lairs.": "这个阶段是大多数龙首次建立自己的领土和巢穴的时候。一条年轻的龙的领地覆盖大约50英里的范围。这也是龙开始形成魔法纽带的时候，这些纽带将它们与它们的族群和它们巢穴周围的地区联系在一起。",
	"Hunting dragons typically fly on a more-or-less circular path out to one edge of their territory and back in a day, traveling about 75 miles in total. Young dragons also use their hunting flights to keep tabs on happenings within their territory and are keenly aware of other creatures whose territory neighbors or overlaps their own. A young dragon can become a significant threat to a city or kingdom, either through overt violence or subtle manipulation.": "猎龙通常在一天内沿着或多或少的环形路线飞到其领地的一个边缘，然后再回来，总行程约75英里。年轻的龙还利用它们的狩猎飞行来监视其领地内发生的事情，并敏锐地注意到与它们的领地相邻或重叠的其他生物。年轻的龙可以通过公开的暴力或微妙的操纵，成为一个城市或王国的重大威胁。",

	"Most adult dragons establish additional lairs to expand their territory. These lairs are usually set 50 to 75 miles apart, so the dragon can fly from one to the next in a single day's travel. An adult dragon typically hunts the area around one lair for a month or more, then moves on to another lair. The dragon's magical connection to a lair can transform the surrounding region, as represented by regional effects.": "大多数成年龙会建立额外的巢穴来扩大它们的领地。这些巢穴通常相隔50至75英里，所以龙可以在一天的行程中从一个巢穴飞到另一个巢穴。成年龙通常会在一个巢穴周围狩猎一个月或更长时间，然后再转移到另一个巢穴。龙与巢穴的魔法联系可以改变周围的区域，这一点由区域效应来体现。",

	"Develop dragonsight to pursue goals across multiple worlds": "开发龙眼，在多个世界追求目标",
	"As dragons age, their sense of territory expands, and many establish multiple lairs across the region they call home. The larger a dragon's territory is, the more likely it is to edge up against or overlap the territory of another dragon. The territory of an adult or ancient dragon often encompasses the territories of younger dragons, as long as the older dragon doesn't feel threatened by the younger ones.": "随着龙的年龄增长，它们的领地意识也在扩大，许多龙在它们称之为家的地区建立了多个巢穴。一条龙的领地越大，它就越有可能与另一条龙的领地相邻或重叠。成年龙或古龙的领地通常包括年轻龙的领地，只要老龙不觉得受到年轻龙的威胁。",

	"An area about 300 miles across—a kingdom or a large geographical region—can contain the territories of two to three dozen dragons, as long as most of them are young. Only three or four adult or ancient dragons are likely to occupy such a region.

	"Dragons are considered ancient once they reach eight hundred years of life, and many live for centuries more. Ancient dragons are among the mightiest creatures in the multiverse, and like characters in the fourth tier of play (levels 17 to 20), they are powerful enough to alter the fate of the world and upset the balance of power across the planes of existence.": "龙一旦达到八百年的寿命就被认为是远古龙，许多龙还能活上几个世纪。古龙是多元宇宙中最强大的生物之一，就像第四层游戏中的角色（17至20级）一样，它们的力量足以改变世界的命运，并打破整个存在平面的力量平衡。",
	"An ancient dragon typically has several lairs, each one suffused with powerful magic.

Most greatwyrms are at least twelve centuries old and have hoards worth millions of gold pieces, but they are otherwise similar to other ancient dragons in their goals and perspectives.": "最古老的古龙有时会转变为具有神一般力量的神话生物。这些伟大的巫师，如{@book chapter 6|FTD|6}所述，是龙族天性的近乎完美的化身，并且充满了物质世界的魔力，它们几乎是不朽的。许多人是由古龙将自己的多个回声结合成一个肉体的形式而产生的，据说Ashardalon和Chronepsis就曾这样做过。大多数大巫师至少有12个世纪的历史，拥有价值数百万金币的囤积物，但在其他方面，他们的目标和观点与其他古龙相似。",

	"Dragon reproduction varies from world to world in the Material Plane and can vary further depending on the family, kind, or individual nature of the dragons involved. Humanoids observing dragons have long assumed that their reproductive cycle resembles that of mundane reptiles—that two dragons of different sexes mate and produce a clutch of eggs. Sometimes, on some worlds, this is true, but dragon reproduction covers a wide range of other possibilities. You can use the Origin of Dragon Eggs table to choose a method of reproduction that holds true for all dragons on your world, to determine the origin of a specific clutch of eggs, or for anything in between.": "在物质世界中，龙的繁殖因世界而异，而且会因龙的家族、种类或个体性质的不同而进一步变化。长期以来，观察龙的人类一直认为它们的繁殖周期与世俗的爬行动物相似--两条不同性别的龙交配并产生一窝蛋。有时，在某些世界上，这是真的，但龙的繁殖涵盖了其他广泛的可能性。你可以使用 \"龙蛋的起源 \"表来选择一种适用于你的世界上所有龙的繁殖方法，来确定某一窝龙蛋的起源，或者用于两者之间的任何事情。",
	"{@b Spontaneous Reincarnation}. When an adult or older dragon dies, one or more eggs form in the dragon's decomposing body.

	"{@b Seedlings of the First World}. At the heart of the world (underground, or in a remote area of pristine wilderness) stands a tree on which dragon eggs grow like fruit. Once in a lifetime, each dragon feels an overwhelming urge to seek out this tree. After finding it, the dragon must persuade its guardian to relinquish one or more eggs.": "{@b Seedlings of the First World}. 在世界的中心（地下，或原始荒野的偏远地区）矗立着一棵树，龙蛋在上面像水果一样生长。每条龙一生中都会有一次压倒性的冲动，去寻找这棵树。找到它后，龙必须说服它的监护人放弃一个或多个蛋。",

	"{@b Draconic Transformation}. Enlightened non-dragons (most often Humanoids) are transformed into dragon eggs when they die, when they experience profound enlightenment, or when they undergo a ritual that might involve bathing in dragon blood or being devoured by a dragon. Humanoids and dragons alike understand the transformation to be a transition into a higher state of existence.": "{@b Draconic Transformation}. 开明的非龙（最常见的是人形生物）在死亡时、在经历了深刻的开悟时，或者在经历了可能涉及沐浴龙血或被龙吞噬的仪式时，会被转化为龙蛋。人形生物和龙都明白，这种转变是向更高的生存状态的过渡。",

	"{@b Spontaneous Formation}. Dragon eggs arise naturally in certain regions, often in underground veins of metal ore or gems for metallic and gem dragons, respectively, or in extreme environments (volcanoes, arctic wastes, deadly swamps, and so forth) for chromatic dragons. The eggs might hatch on their own, or they might have to be unearthed first by another creature, whether that's an adult or older dragon or a hapless miner.": "{@b Spontaneous Formation}. 龙蛋在某些地区自然产生，对于金属龙和宝石龙来说，通常是在金属矿石或宝石的地下矿脉中，对于色龙来说，则是在极端环境中（火山、北极荒原、致命的沼泽等）。龙蛋可能会自行孵化，也可能必须先由其他生物挖掘出来，无论是成年龙、老龙还是无能的矿工。",

	"Once an egg comes into being, it must mature before it is ready to hatch into a wyrmling. Typically, an egg thrives only in an environment appropriate for a dragon of its kind—nestled in a pool of lava for a red or gold dragon, in ice for a white or silver dragon, in rotting vegetation for a black or green dragon, in sun-heated sand for a brass or blue dragon, or in a storm-wracked sea cave or inhospitable moorland for a bronze or copper dragon. Gem dragon eggs generally incubate encased in rock or in small caves. The incubation period for any egg might range from 6 months to several decades or longer.": "一旦一个蛋出现，它必须在准备好孵化成一个wyrmling之前成熟。通常情况下，龙蛋只能在适合龙的环境中生长--红龙或金龙在熔岩池中，白龙或银龙在冰中，黑龙或绿龙在腐烂的植物中，铜龙或蓝龙在阳光下加热的沙子中，或者铜龙或铜龙在风暴中的海洞或荒凉的荒地上。宝石龙蛋一般是在岩石中或小洞穴中孵化。任何龙蛋的孵化期可能从6个月到数十年或更长。",

	"Dragons create half-dragon progeny for a wide range of reasons. Some dragons create half-dragons to secure reliable minions. Others seed half-dragons around their lairs to make the area more dangerous to interlopers. And on many occasions, half-dragons simply appear spontaneously or are an accidental consequence of a dragon's magical power and influence.": "龙出于各种原因创造了半龙人的后代。有些龙创造半龙以确保可靠的爪牙。其他人则在他们的巢穴周围播种半龙，使该地区对入侵者更加危险。在许多情况下，半龙只是自发地出现，或者是龙的魔力和影响力的意外结果。",

	"{@b Blood Transformation}. A creature that bathes in or drinks the blood of a dragon can sometimes be transformed into a half-dragon. A dragon might voluntarily offer some blood to bring this about, or it could happen accidentally when a would-be dragonslayer is splashed with dragon blood.": "{@b Blood Transformation}. 沐浴或饮用龙血的生物有时会被转化为半龙人。龙可能会自愿提供一些血来实现这一点，或者当一个潜在的屠龙者被龙血溅到时，它可能会意外地发生。",
	"{@b Cradle Favor}. A dragon might bestow the gift of draconic power on a newborn baby or an unborn child—as either a blessing or a curse.": "{@b Cradle Favor}. 龙可能会将龙力的天赋赐予新生儿或未出生的孩子--作为一种祝福或诅咒。",
	"{@b Hoard Thieves}. The hoard of an older dragon is imbued with that dragon's power. Those who steal from such a hoard might transform into half-dragons as that power leaches into them.": "{@b Hoard Thieves}. 老龙的囤积物被灌注了该龙的力量。那些从这样的囤积物中偷窃的人可能会变成半龙人，因为这种力量会渗入他们体内。",

	"Dragons are intimately bound up with the fabric of magic that undergirds the Material Plane. As a result, the death of any dragon is an event of tremendous significance—and those who bring about a dragon's death are often changed forever.": "龙与支撑物质世界的魔法结构紧密相连。因此，任何龙的死亡都是一个具有巨大意义的事件--那些导致龙死亡的人往往会被永远改变。",
	"Some sages describe dragons as being akin to knots in the fabric of magic—concentrations of power in material form. When a dragon dies, that knot is undone, sometimes resulting in a surge of magical energy. You can use the Dragon Death Throes table to help you decide what happens when a dragon dies. Characters who slay a dragon are often on their last legs when the dragon finally succumbs, so if an effect is likely to kill a character, roll again or choose a less dangerous result.": "一些圣人将龙描述为类似于魔法结构中的结--物质形式的力量集中。当龙死亡时，这个结会被解开，有时会导致魔法能量的激增。你可以使用 \"龙的死亡 \"表来帮助你决定龙死后会发生什么。当龙最终屈服时，杀死龙的角色往往已经奄奄一息了，所以如果一个效果可能会杀死一个角色，请再次掷骰子或选择一个不那么危险的结果。",
	"The dragon immediately uses one of its lair actions, centering the effect on itself. For example, a fallen black dragon and any characters around it might be pulled into a nearby pool of water, and a copper dragon's body might be swallowed suddenly in mud.": "龙会立即使用它的一个巢穴行动，将效果集中在自己身上。例如，一条倒下的黑龙和它周围的任何角色都可能被拉到附近的水塘里，而一条铜龙的身体可能突然被泥土吞噬。",
	"The dragon uses its breath weapon one last time.": "龙最后一次使用它的呼吸武器。",
	"The dragon's body transforms into stone, metal, lava, ice, or mist. Or the body dissipates, leaving behind only a transformed heart or other organ.": "龙的身体会转化为石头、金属、熔岩、冰或雾。或者身体消散，只留下一个转化的心脏或其他器官。",

	"The body is drawn through a portal to the lair of one of the dragon's echoes on another world, increasing that echo's power.": "尸体通过传送门被吸引到另一个世界的龙的一个回声的巢穴，增加该回声的力量。",
	"As described in the {@book Monster Manual|MM} and discussed in more detail in {@book chapter 4|FTD|4|Regional Effects}, a dragon's presence alters the region around the dragon's lair. When the dragon dies, those effects typically end immediately or fade away over the course of several days. But a traumatic death sometimes extends negative effects throughout the region. These can include instantaneous effects as well as lingering magic that persists for {@dice 1d10} days, as in the following examples:": "正如{@book Monster Manual|MM}中所描述的，以及{@book chapter 4|FTD|4|Regional Effects}中更详细的讨论，龙的存在会改变龙的巢穴周围的区域。当龙死亡时，这些影响通常会立即结束或在数天内逐渐消失。但是创伤性的死亡有时会将负面效应延伸到整个地区。这些影响可以包括瞬时效应以及持续{@dice 1d10}天的挥之不去的魔法，如下面的例子。",

	"Ordinary vegetation within 1 mile of the dragon's lair blackens and shrivels.": "龙的巢穴1英里内的普通植被会变黑和枯萎。",
	"When a dragon dies, the power enfleshed in the dragon doesn't just disappear from the world. Over time, it disperses, but in the moments immediately surrounding the dragon's death, it can be passed on to others—or claimed. Sometimes (as discussed in \"{@book Reproduction|FTD|3|Reproduction}\" above) a dragon's death gives rise to an egg, transferring the dragon's power directly to a new generation. In other cases, a dragon at the brink of death invests power into another creature—usually a dragon, but sometimes a sovereign, a sage, or an adventurer. Moreover, those who slay a dragon could seize the dragon's power.": "当龙死后，龙身上的力量并不只是从世界上消失。随着时间的推移，它被分散了，但在龙死前的那段时间里，它可以被传递给其他人，或者被索取。有时（如上文\"{@book Reproduction|FTD|3|Reproduction} \"所述）龙的死亡会产生一个蛋，将龙的力量直接传给新的一代。在其他情况下，处于死亡边缘的龙将力量注入另一种生物--通常是龙，但有时是君主、圣人或冒险家。此外，那些杀死龙的人可以夺取龙的力量。",
	"A dying dragon might willingly pass on power in different ways. The most common process is for the recipient to inhale the dragon's dying breath—which often involves being subjected to at least a diminished form of the dragon's breath weapon. A gem dragon might psionically implant a gemstone in the recipient's body that carries the dragon's power. A dragon might instead lay a claw on the recipient or bequeath a piece of treasure as an embodiment of the transferred power.": "垂死的龙可能愿意以不同的方式传授力量。最常见的过程是让接受者吸入龙的临终气息--这通常涉及到至少受到龙的气息武器的削弱形式。宝石龙可能会在受术者的身体里植入一颗携带龙的力量的宝石。相反，龙可能会在接受者身上放置一只爪子，或者遗赠一件宝物作为转移力量的体现。",
	"When a dragon dies a violent death, the dragon's power might linger in the corpse for a short time. Drinking or bathing in the dragon's blood; sleeping entombed in the carcass; or consuming the dragon's heart, brain, eyes, breath-producing organ, or muscle can be an effective way of claiming the fallen creature's magical might. Using a dragon's corpse this way might be a trial in itself, as the lingering energies in the body can cause serious injury even after the dragon's death.": "当龙暴毙时，龙的力量可能会在尸体上停留很短的时间。饮用或沐浴龙的血液；睡在龙的尸体里；或食用龙的心脏、大脑、眼睛、呼吸器官或肌肉，都可以有效地获取堕落生物的魔法力量。以这种方式使用龙的尸体本身就可能是一种考验，因为即使在龙死后，龙体内残留的能量也会造成严重伤害。",
	"It's also possible for a dragon's power to transfer immediately and automatically to creatures that participate in the dragon's death or that are present when the dragon dies. A burst of power might emanate from the dragon at the moment of death, affecting each creature within 300 feet of the body. Or a fragment of power might enter every creature that has dealt damage to the dragon over the course of the dragon's life.": "龙的力量也有可能立即自动转移到参与龙的死亡或龙死亡时在场的生物身上。在龙死亡的那一刻，可能会有一股力量从龙身上散发出来，影响到身体周围300英尺内的每个生物。或者一股力量的碎片可能进入每一个在龙的生命过程中对其造成伤害的生物。",
	"I've never met a creature I didn't love. But I have met a few I didn't want alive.": "我从来没有见过一个我不爱的生物。但我遇到过一些我不希望活着的生物。",
	"Despite their incredible life spans, some dragons pursue undeath to extend their existences. Others stumble into undeath unwillingly or unwittingly. Either way, an Undead dragon is a force to be reckoned with.": "尽管龙的寿命惊人，但有些龙追求不死以延长它们的生命。其他人则在不情愿或不知情的情况下跌入不死之境。无论怎样，不死龙都是一股不可忽视的力量。",
	"Dracoliches are created by cultists or necromancers who either persuade or trick a dragon into undergoing a foul ritual. In the world of the Forgotten Realms, this ritual originated with the Cult of the Dragon, whose teachings (based on a mistranslated fragment of ancient prophecy) maintain that \"dead dragons will rule the world entire.\" The cult thus creates dracoliches as a step toward achieving that particular vision of a future paradise. Similar rites exist on other worlds, whether spread by cultists from Faerûn, invented independently, or discovered by dragons who have dracolich echoes on Faerûn.": "Dracoliches是由崇拜者或亡灵巫师创造的，他们劝说或欺骗龙接受一种肮脏的仪式。在《被遗忘的世界》中，这种仪式起源于 \"龙的崇拜\"，其教义（基于一个被误译的古代预言片段）认为 \"死龙将统治整个世界\"。因此，该邪教创造了龙族，作为实现未来天堂这一特定愿景的一个步骤。类似的仪式也存在于其他世界，无论是由法鲁恩的邪教徒传播的，还是独立发明的，或者是由法鲁恩的龙发现的，都有dracolich的影子。",
	"Whatever form an Undead dragon takes, the creature's transformation ripples throughout the Material Plane. Every dragon has echoes on other worlds, and when one dragon violates the natural cycle of life and death, that dragon's echoes are often affected—particularly in the case of dracoliches. A dracolich's echoes suffer a wasting affliction that spreads out from the dracolich like a contagion. Afflicted dragons grow increasingly violent and cruel, and the physical deterioration they experience from aging accelerates. This wasting can even drive an affected dragon to seek out undeath.": "无论不死龙采取什么形式，该生物的转变都会在整个物质世界产生涟漪。每条龙在其他世界都有回声，当一条龙违反了生与死的自然循环时，那条龙的回声往往会受到影响--尤其是在龙人的情况下。德拉科里奇的回声会遭受一种消耗性的折磨，像传染病一样从德拉科里奇身上蔓延开来。受影响的龙会变得越来越暴力和残忍，他们因衰老而经历的身体退化也会加速。这种消瘦甚至会驱使受影响的龙去寻找死亡。",

Some of those echoes are very similar to each other, but others are more radically different.": "龙与物质界的魔法和第一世界的历史有着独特的联系，这使它们与跨越物质界无数世界的其他龙有着神秘的联系。理论上说，每一条活过的色龙、金属龙和宝石龙在物质界的每个世界都有一个独特的回声。其中一些回声彼此非常相似，但其他回声则有更大的差异。",

	"Bahamut and Tiamat, the primordial dragons and the purported creators of the First World, are the closest things to gods among dragonkind. Since they share the same fundamental connection to the Material Plane as their dragon offspring, Bahamut and Tiamat are ontologically distinct from the gods that hail from the Outer Planes. But for practical purposes, they are divine—worshiped by mortal creatures, able to grant cleric spells to their followers, and both ageless and immortal. Since the destruction of the First World, both primordial dragons now dwell in the Outer Planes—Bahamut on Mount Celestia and Tiamat in the Nine Hells.": "巴哈姆特和提亚马特是原始龙，据说是第一世界的创造者，是龙族中最接近于神的东西。由于他们和他们的龙的后代一样与物质界有着相同的基本联系，巴哈姆特和提亚马特在本体论上与来自外部星球的神灵不同。但就实际情况而言，他们是受到凡人生物崇拜的神，能够向他们的追随者授予牧师法术，而且是不老不死的。自从第一世界毁灭后，两条原始龙现在都居住在外星--天山的巴哈姆特和九幽地狱的提亚马特。",
	"On many worlds, Humanoids worship Bahamut and Tiamat as gods. On Krynn, they are the greatest among the gods, though they are known there as Paladine and Takhisis and are not always pictured as dragons. In the {@table A Sample Pantheon; Dawn War Deities|DMG|Dawn War pantheon} described in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, Bahamut is revered as a god of justice and nobility, favored by paladins, while Tiamat is known as a god of greed, wealth, and vengeance.": "在许多世界上，人形生物把巴哈姆特和提亚马特当作神来崇拜。在克莱恩，他们是最伟大的神，尽管他们在那里被称为帕拉丁和塔克西丝，并不总是被描绘成龙的样子。在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}描述的{@table A Sample Pantheon; Dawn War Deities|DMG|Dawn War pantheon}中，巴哈姆特被尊为正义和高贵之神，受到圣骑士的青睐，而提亚马特则被称为贪婪、财富和复仇之神。",
	"Dragons view the primordial dragons differently. To metallic dragons, Bahamut is more like a king than a god. Individual dragons might owe Bahamut allegiance, respect him, pay tribute to him, and strive to emulate him. Similarly, chromatic dragons might fear, respect, envy, and appease Tiamat as a sovereign. But none of those attitudes and behaviors bear any resemblance in a dragon's mind to the worship that mortals offer to their gods.": "龙族对原始龙的看法不同。对于金属龙来说，巴哈姆特更像是一个国王而不是一个神。个别龙可能会对巴哈姆特效忠，尊重他，向他致敬，并努力模仿他。同样，色龙可能会害怕、尊重、羡慕并安抚作为君主的提亚马特。但在龙的心目中，这些态度和行为都与凡人对其神灵的崇拜没有任何相似之处。",
	"A few other dragons also command reverence from their kin. These are often greatwyrms who have undergone a sort of apotheosis, joining multiple echoes of themselves into a single powerful form. A few are ancient dragons who have cultivated their dragonsight to such a degree that they can coordinate the actions of their echoes across the Material Plane, influencing events on multiple worlds at once. Humanoids might consider these dragons gods, but as with Bahamut and Tiamat, dragons respect these figures for their wisdom, their might, their magic, and their wealth; they don't worship them. Such enlightened dragons include Aasterinian (a brass dragon who serves as a messenger for Bahamut and is sometimes identified as a god of invention), Chronepsis (a black dragon who now resides in the Outlands, sometimes imagined as a god of fate), and Tamara (a silver dragon of transcendent beneficence, described as a god of life). A number of such dragons of legend are discussed in more detail in sidebars in {@book chapters 5|FTD|5} and {@book 6|FTD|6}.": "其他一些龙也得到了他们亲属的敬重。这些龙通常是经历了某种神化的大巫师，他们将自己的多个回声结合成一个强大的形式。少数古龙将他们的龙视力修炼到如此程度，以至于他们可以协调他们的回声在整个物质世界的行动，同时影响到多个世界的事件。人类可能会认为这些龙是神，但就像巴哈姆特和提亚马特一样，龙尊重这些人物的智慧、力量、魔法和财富，他们并不崇拜他们。这种开明的龙包括Aasterinian（一条铜龙，担任巴哈姆特的信使，有时被认定为发明之神）、Chronepsis（一条黑龙，现在居住在外域，有时被想象为命运之神）和Tamara（一条银龙，具有超凡的善心，被描述为生命之神）。在{@book chapters 5|FTD|5}和{@book 6|FTD|6}的侧边栏中，对一些此类传说中的龙有更详细的讨论。",
	"Dragons are not religious by nature. They can grow to become some of the most formidable creatures in the multiverse without relying on any external power, and they learn self-sufficiency and self-interest from the moment of their hatching. They do not appeal to divine powers for aid, nor do they beseech them for mercy. That said, some dragons could be described as spiritual. A dragon might cultivate an awareness of the interconnectedness of all that exists and strive to nurture the health of the whole or to exploit that connection. But even the most spiritual dragons have a keen sense of their own importance.": "龙的本质不是宗教。它们可以成长为多元宇宙中最强大的生物，而不需要依赖任何外部力量，它们从孵化的那一刻起就学会了自给自足和自利。它们不会向神力求援，也不会向神力求饶。也就是说，有些龙可以被描述为有灵性。龙可能会培养一种对所有存在的事物相互联系的意识，并努力培养整体的健康，或利用这种联系。但即使是最有灵性的龙，也对自己的重要性有敏锐的感觉。",
	"The time a dragon spends in a humanoid form is not directly related to our opinion of said form. In fact, dragons generally disagree with mortals about visual taste.": "龙花在人形上的时间与我们对该形态的看法没有直接关系。事实上，龙一般不同意凡人的视觉品味。",
	"Most of you are extremely misguided. Looking glasses have not helped.": "你们中的大多数人都被极度误导。望文生义没有帮助。",
	"Most metallic and gem dragons can change shape to take on a Humanoid or Beast form by the time they reach adulthood or ancient age. A few other Dragon varieties possess similar abilities (including deep dragons, described in {@book chapter 6|FTD|6|Deep Dragons}), and you can give any dragon the Change Shape action of an adult or ancient dragon without affecting the dragon's challenge rating (as noted under \"{@book Customizing Dragons|FTD|3|Customizing Dragons}\" earlier in this chapter). Likewise, if you use the {@book Monster Manual|MM} variant rule to make dragons innate spellcasters, you could give any adult or older dragon the {@spell polymorph} spell to take on an alternate form.": "大多数金属龙和宝石龙在达到成年或远古时代时可以改变形状，变成人形或兽形。其他一些龙类也拥有类似的能力（包括深渊龙，在{@book chapter 6|FTD|6|Deep Dragons}中有所描述），你可以给任何龙以成年龙或古龙的变身动作而不影响龙的挑战等级（如本章前面的\"{@book Customizing Dragons|FTD|3|Customizing Dragons} \"中所述）。同样地，如果你使用{@book Monster Manual|MM}的变异规则使龙成为天生的法术师，你可以给任何成年龙或古龙施展{@spell polymorph}的法术，使其变成另一种形态。",
	"Dragons typically use their shape-shifting ability to move about in the world without drawing attention to themselves. Dragons like to know as much as they can about the lands around their lairs and the inhabitants of those lands, and posing as a more innocuous creature is an easy way to gather such information. Many metallic dragons also believe they are following the example of Bahamut, who is known to wander the worlds of the Material Plane in Humanoid guise, appearing sometimes as an elderly sage or wizard, other times as a young fisher or monk. In any of these forms, he is often accompanied by seven gold dragons in the form of brilliant yellow songbirds.": "龙通常利用它们的变形能力在这个世界上活动而不引起人们的注意。龙喜欢尽可能多地了解它们巢穴周围的土地和这些土地上的居民，而冒充更无害的生物是收集这些信息的一个简单方法。许多金属龙还认为它们是在效仿巴哈姆特，众所周知，巴哈姆特以人形的姿态在物质界的各个世界游荡，有时以年老的圣人或巫师出现，有时则以年轻的渔夫或僧侣出现。在任何一种形态下，他都经常有七条金龙陪伴，形态为灿烂的黄色鸣禽。",
	"Famously, Bahamut traveled the world of Krynn in the guise of a human wizard named Fizban, guiding the peoples of that world as they prepared for war against the evil forces of Tiamat. In the same way, some metallic dragons use their Humanoid forms to influence people. Since they can remain in Humanoid form indefinitely, metallic dragons often create false identities and mundane lives for themselves. Thanks to their keen intellects and strong personalities, shape-shifted dragons can easily end up in positions of leadership—either overtly as mayors, high priests, the heads of knightly orders, or crime bosses or behind the scenes as advisors, activists, or the spouses of rulers.": "著名的是，巴哈姆特以一个名叫菲兹班的人类巫师的身份在克莱恩世界旅行，指导该世界的人民准备与提亚马特的邪恶力量开战。以同样的方式，一些金属龙利用他们的人形形态来影响人们。由于他们可以无限期地保持人形，金属龙经常为自己创造虚假的身份和世俗的生活。由于他们敏锐的智力和强烈的个性，变形龙可以很容易地走上领导岗位--要么公开地成为市长、大祭司、骑士团团长或犯罪头目，要么在幕后成为顾问、活动家或统治者的配偶。",
	"The propensity of some metallic dragons to spend long periods of time in Humanoid form has led to numerous bits of folklore, including tales in which these shape-shifters are sometimes erroneously identified as unique varieties of metallic dragons.": "一些金属龙喜欢长时间以类人形态存在，这导致了许多民间传说，包括这些变身者有时被错误地认定为金属龙的独特品种的故事。",
	"In the world of the Forgotten Realms, stories speak of \"weredragons\" or \"song dragons,\" which are variously described as \"beautiful humans transformed into dragons\" or as a distinct variety of metallic dragon. The world of Greyhawk has legends of similar dragons, called either Greyhawk dragons or steel dragons, which are said to favor life among Humanoids in the hustle and bustle of great cities.": "在《被遗忘的领域》的世界里，故事中提到了 \"狼龙 \"或 \"歌龙\"，它们被不同程度地描述为 \"美丽的人类变成了龙 \"或者是一种独特的金属龙。灰鹰世界有类似龙的传说，被称为灰鹰龙或钢龙，据说它们喜欢在大城市的喧嚣中生活在人族中。",
	"The creatures featured in these legends are almost certainly copper, silver, or other metallic dragons who simply favored that particular form. Some dragons even seem to prefer Humanoid form to their own and delight in surrounding themselves with companions who can answer their endless questions about Humanoid art, culture, history, and politics.": "这些传说中的生物几乎可以肯定是铜龙、银龙或其他金属龙，它们只是喜欢这种特殊的形式。有些龙甚至似乎更喜欢人形，并乐于和那些能回答他们关于人形艺术、文化、历史和政治的无尽问题的伙伴们在一起。",
	"Of course, years of careful scheming can be quickly unraveled if a shape-shifted dragon's true nature is discovered. As a result, such dragons are careful to avoid being seen in their true forms. They show great caution in dealing with adventurers or anyone else who might have the magical ability to expose their nature. And dragons who need to revert to their true form are careful to do so out of sight—or to leave no surviving witnesses.": "当然，如果变形龙的真实本性被发现，多年的精心谋划也会很快被揭穿。因此，这种龙会小心翼翼地避免被人看到它们的真实形态。他们在与冒险者或其他可能拥有暴露其本性的魔法能力的人打交道时表现得非常谨慎。需要恢复真身的龙会小心翼翼地在视线之外进行，或者不留下任何幸存的证人。",
	"Some metallic dragons believe that if they remain in a shape-shifted form for too long, they'll lose the ability to revert to their true form. This is probably just superstition, but many dragons claim to know of others of their kind condemned to spend the rest of a very long life trapped in Humanoid or Beast form. Because of this belief, dragons who spend prolonged periods in the guise of other creatures often find periodic excuses to venture into the wilderness, letting them stretch their wings away from prying eyes.": "一些金属龙认为，如果他们保持变形的形态太久，他们就会失去恢复到他们真实形态的能力。这可能只是迷信，但许多龙声称知道他们的同类被判处以人形或兽形度过漫长的余生。由于这种信念，那些长期以其他生物为伪装的龙经常会找到定期的借口去野外冒险，让他们在远离窥视的地方伸展翅膀。",
	"The only thing better than getting a dragon involved...is getting five dragons involved!": "唯一比让一条龙参与进来更好的事情......是让五条龙参与进来!",
	"Most dragons are solitary, living alone or keeping company with only a single dragon companion or a tight family group. Occasionally, though, dragons form associations with other dragons in pursuit of a common purpose. These associations are more common among lawful dragons and center around goals broader than a single dragon's territory or concerns. This section discusses several organizations whose plots can unfold across small regions, whole worlds, or even multiple worlds.": "大多数龙都是独居的，独自生活或只与一个龙伙伴或一个紧密的家庭团体为伴。但偶尔，龙会与其他龙结成联盟，追求共同的目标。这些协会在合法的龙中更为常见，并且围绕着比单个龙的领地或关切更广泛的目标。本节讨论了几个组织，它们的情节可以在小区域、整个世界甚至多个世界中展开。",
	"Founded in Faerûn, the Cult of the Dragon was based on a mistranslated prophecy that \"dead dragons shall rule the world entire.\" For most of its history, the cult has focused on creating dracoliches to fulfill this prophecy. Its members have been responsible for creating more dracoliches than any other force on the Material Plane. And thanks to the corruption that spreads between worlds whenever a dragon embraces undeath (see \"{@book Undeath|FTD|3|Undeath}\" earlier in this chapter), the cult's influence has been tremendous.": "龙的崇拜成立于法鲁恩，它基于一个错误的预言：\"死龙将统治整个世界\"。在其大部分历史中，该教派一直专注于创造龙人以实现这一预言。其成员创造的龙人比物质世界的任何其他力量都要多。由于每当龙拥抱死亡时，腐败就会在世界之间蔓延（见本章前面的\"{@book Undeath|FTD|3|Undeath}\"），该邪教的影响力是巨大的。",
	"In recent years, Tiamat has worked through a young member of the Cult of the Dragon to alter the cult's foundational beliefs. The Dragon Queen steered this prophet, named Severin, to the correct translation of the cult's foundational prophecy: \"...naught will be left save shattered thrones, with no rulers but the dead. Dragons shall rule the world entire...\" Guided by this new vision, Severin has worked tirelessly to bring about the ascendance to power of living dragons, even attempting to bring an avatar of Tiamat into the world to wreak havoc (and nearly succeeding).": "近年来，提亚马特通过龙神教的一名年轻成员来改变该教派的基本信仰。龙后引导这位名叫塞弗林的先知正确翻译了该教派的基本预言。\"......除了破碎的王座之外，什么都不会留下，除了死人之外没有统治者。龙将统治整个世界......\" 在这个新愿景的指导下，塞弗林不知疲倦地工作，以实现活龙的升华，甚至试图将提亚马特的化身带到这个世界上进行破坏（并几乎成功）。",
	"Since the failure of Severin's effort to bring Tiamat into the world, the Cult of the Dragon has been sharply divided. Some of its members pursue Severin's new vision for the cult, keeping their focus on his reinterpretation of the prophecy. Others still support the prophecy's old interpretation, continuing their efforts to create dracoliches.": "自从塞弗林将提亚马特带入世界的努力失败后，神龙教就出现了剧烈的分裂。一些成员追求塞弗林对邪教的新愿景，将注意力放在他对预言的重新解释上。其他人仍然支持预言的旧解释，继续努力创造龙人。",
	"The Tyranny of Dragons adventure details the cult's efforts to bring Tiamat's avatar into the world. Beyond that plot, the Cult of the Dragon Adventure Hooks table offers suggestions for how adventurers might encounter this sinister cult.": "龙的暴政 \"冒险详述了该邪教为将提亚马特的化身带入世界而做出的努力。除了这个情节之外，《龙的崇拜》冒险钩表提供了冒险者如何遇到这个邪恶的邪教的建议。",

	"A group of cultists is trying to access a magic portal linking the Material Plane to Tiamat's domain, hoping to break the seal that has kept the portal closed for centuries.": "一群邪教徒正试图进入一个连接物质世界和提亚马特领域的魔法门户，希望能打破使门户关闭了几个世纪的封印。",
	"A dragon and a dracolich, representing the opposing factions of the Cult of the Dragon, war against each other. Their battle is devastating the region between their lairs and endangers countless innocents.": "一条龙和一只龙人，代表着龙之崇拜的对立派别，彼此交战。他们的战斗对他们的巢穴之间的地区造成了破坏，并危及无数的无辜者。",
	"A fringe group of cultists decides to focus on the \"shattered thrones\" part of the ancient prophecy and attempts to assassinate rulers and destroy their seats of power.": "一个边缘的邪教组织决定专注于古代预言中 \"破碎的王座 \"部分，并试图暗杀统治者，摧毁他们的权力席位。",
	"A cabal of dragons called the Chamber keeps tabs on events unfolding across the world of Eberron, monitoring and manipulating the fulfillment of the ancient Draconic Prophecy. Most other creatures are merely pawns in the dragons' centuries-long schemes, their needs and lives relevant only insofar as they intersect with the Prophecy.": "一个名为 \"商会 \"的龙族集团一直关注着Eberron世界中发生的事件，监视并操纵着古老的Draconic预言的实现。大多数其他生物只是龙族长达几个世纪的计划中的棋子，他们的需求和生活只有在与预言相交的情况下才有意义。",
	"The Draconic Prophecy is not a single collection of oracular sayings, nor is it any kind of organized prediction of future events. Rather, the Prophecy is a map of possible futures—an outline of the complex relationships of cause and effect. Dragons of the Chamber study it not to know what the future holds, but so they can comprehend the possible consequences of any action they or others might take—consequences that might unfold over the course of centuries. From the perspective of the dragons of the Chamber, the tumultuous events of national histories are but tiny waves in a vast ocean, but those waves are often warnings of the mightier forces of the tides.": "Draconic预言不是一个单一的神谕集合，也不是对未来事件的任何一种有组织的预测。相反，预言是一张可能的未来的地图--一个复杂的因果关系的轮廓。密室的龙研究它并不是为了知道未来会发生什么，而是为了理解他们或其他人可能采取的任何行动的可能后果--这些后果可能会在几个世纪内展开。从商会龙的角度来看，国家历史上的动荡事件不过是浩瀚海洋中的小浪花，但这些浪花往往是对更强大的潮汐力量的警告。",
	"As described in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}, the dragons of the Chamber primarily act as observers, gathering information about new aspects of the Prophecy. They are also charged with stopping any creatures attempting to use the Prophecy for their own ends, including agents of the ancient Fiends known as the Lords of Dust. That said, some members of the Chamber try to take the fulfillment of the Prophecy into their own talons, directing the future toward outcomes they desire.": "如{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}所述，议事厅的龙主要充当观察者，收集有关预言的新方面的信息。他们还负责阻止任何试图利用预言来达到自己目的的生物，包括被称为尘埃领主的古老恶魔的代理人。也就是说，商会的一些成员试图将预言的实现纳入他们自己的爪子，将未来导向他们所希望的结果。",
	"The dragons of the Chamber recognize the dragonmarks that appear on the skin of certain Humanoids on Eberron as manifestations of the Prophecy. These marks reveal nuances of the Prophecy to those who can understand them and lend symbolic weight to the actions of those who bear them—for example, a person with the Mark of Storm might fulfill the role of \"a mighty storm\" in the Prophecy. For this reason, agents of the Chamber are interested in the activities of dragonmarked families and heirs.": "密室的龙认识到，出现在艾伯伦某些人类皮肤上的龙印是预言的表现形式。这些印记向那些能够理解它们的人揭示了预言的细微差别，并为拥有这些印记的人的行为赋予了象征意义--例如，拥有风暴印记的人可能会履行预言中 \"强大的风暴 \"的角色。出于这个原因，商会的代理人对有龙纹的家庭和继承人的活动很感兴趣。",
	"Most agents of the Chamber assume the Draconic Prophecy is concerned only with the unfolding of possible futures on Eberron. A few of the organization's most ancient members, though, have developed their dragonsight enough to explore the ramifications of the Prophecy across other worlds of the Material Plane. Dragons on multiple worlds might thus act as agents of the Chamber, manipulating history on their own worlds to see whether that affects the unfolding of the Prophecy on Eberron. These elders reason that if dragons can connect their echoes across worlds, then all worlds must exist in a sort of entanglement of causality. This makes the map of possible futures infinitely more complex and tantalizing—and subject to careful manipulation.": "大多数商会的代理人都认为龙族的预言只涉及到Eberron上可能的未来的展开。不过，该组织中少数最古老的成员已经发展出了他们的龙视力，足以探索预言在物质界其他世界的影响。因此，多个世界的龙可以作为商会的代理人，操纵他们自己世界的历史，看看这是否会影响预言在艾伯伦的展开。这些长老的理由是，如果龙可以在不同的世界中连接它们的回声，那么所有的世界都必须存在于某种因果关系的纠缠之中。这使得可能的未来地图变得无限复杂和诱人--并且可以被小心地操纵。",
	"{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} contains abundant ideas for adventures related to the Chamber's activities on Eberron. The Chamber Adventure Hooks table here suggests additional ways characters on other worlds might become entangled in the schemes and experiments of the Chamber, by way of agents whose awareness extends beyond Eberron.": "{@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}包含了大量与商会在Eberron的活动有关的冒险想法。这里的商会冒险钩子表提出了其他世界的角色可能会通过意识延伸到Eberron之外的代理人的方式，与商会的计划和实验纠缠在一起。",

	"A Fiend tries to trick the characters into slaying a dragon belonging to the Chamber.": "一个恶魔试图欺骗人物杀死一条属于商会的龙。",
	"On worlds across the Material Plane, dragons gather in small communities of three to five called lauths. These dragons share a common territory and hoard, live under a strict code of discipline, and devote themselves to a common goal.

Likewise, a lauth's dragons cover a range of ages, ensuring that the lauth's traditions outlive its oldest members.": "一个团体中的藏龙有一个共同的目标，但往往没有什么其他共同之处。根据设计，每个成员通常都是不同类型的龙，为团体的目标带来特殊的能力和观点。同样地，一个联盟的龙涵盖了不同的年龄段，以确保联盟的传统比其最年长的成员更长久。",
	"The arcane markings carved into hidecarved dragons' scales are magical protections, intended to make the dragons more resilient against the threats they might face in carrying out the lauth's purpose. The longer dragons stay with a lauth, the more wards they receive. Most hidecarved dragons have one of these wards plus an additional ward for each age category above wyrmling. You can roll for these effects on the Hidecarved Wards table or choose effects as you wish.": "刻在密雕龙鳞片上的奥术标记是魔法保护，目的是让龙在执行lauth的任务时更能抵御他们可能面临的威胁。龙在lauth的时间越长，它们得到的保护就越多。大多数隐藏的龙都有一个这样的防护措施，再加上一个额外的防护措施，超过巫妖的年龄类别。你可以在密室守护表上为这些效果打滚，或者按照你的意愿选择效果。",

	"\"Breathe, dragons: you are inheritors, / ruling the wreck of the First World's destruction.\" To some dragons, this closing couplet of \"Elegy for the First World\" is not merely an exhortation to dominate the Material Plane, but a call to recreate the original world of the dragon gods. The draconic members of an apocalyptic sect called the Inheritors of the First World believe the cataclysm that destroyed the original creation and brought the myriad worlds of the Material Plane into being can be undone. In fact, they teach that the Material Plane's worlds must be destroyed and recombined so the creation can be brought to its final, glorious purpose.": "\"呼吸吧，龙：你们是继承者，/统治着第一世界毁灭的残骸。\" 对一些龙来说，\"第一世界的挽歌 \"的这副结尾对联不仅是对统治物质世界的劝告，而且是对重建龙神的原始世界的呼吁。一个名为 \"第一世界的继承者 \"的世界末日教派的龙人成员相信，摧毁原始创造并带来物质界无数个世界的大灾难是可以消除的。事实上，他们教导说，物质界的世界必须被摧毁并重新组合，这样才能使创造物达到其最终的、光荣的目的。",
	"The goal of the Inheritors of the First World might seem unattainable; at the very least, achieving it would almost certainly require the intervention of both Bahamut and Tiamat. But they would be opposed by the countless gods who are deeply invested in the Material Plane as it is, and the two primordial dragons have not coordinated their efforts toward a common purpose since before the destruction of the First World. Still, the Inheritors of the First World are extremely knowledgeable about the multiple worlds of the Material Plane, the connections between them, and means of traveling from one world to another.": "第一世界的继承者的目标似乎无法实现；至少，实现它几乎肯定需要巴哈姆特和提亚马特的干预。但他们会遭到无数深陷物质世界的神的反对，而且自从第一世界毁灭之前，这两条原始龙就没有为共同的目的协调过他们的努力。尽管如此，第一世界的继承者们对物质界的多个世界、它们之间的联系以及从一个世界到另一个世界的旅行方式都非常了解。",
	"The work of the Inheritors of the First World consists largely of developing dragonsight, which is latent in all dragons. Leaders within the group have perfected multiple techniques—from alchemical brews to elaborate rites—to help spark the first flickering awareness of a dragon's echoes on other worlds. They freely perform these techniques on any dragons who yearn for this birthright, believing that empowering dragonsight even in dragons with no intention of joining the order ultimately helps advance their cause. A dragon who decides to be initiated into the sect develops a basic awareness of multiple echoes and begins to communicate directly with them in a process akin to lucid dreaming by the time they undergo initiation.": "第一世界的继承者们的工作主要包括发展龙的视力，这是所有龙的潜意识。该组织的领导人已经完善了多种技术--从炼金术酿造到精心设计的仪式，以帮助激发龙对其他世界的回声的第一次闪烁的意识。他们自由地对任何渴望这种天生权利的龙实施这些技术，相信即使是无意加入该组织的龙也能增强龙的视觉，最终有助于推动他们的事业。决定加入该教派的龙对多个回声有了基本的认识，并在接受灌顶时开始与它们直接交流，其过程类似于清醒的梦境。",

	"A central tenet of the Inheritors of the First World is that a reborn Sardior will ultimately inspire Bahamut and Tiamat to join forces once again and return to the task of creation. Many members of the sect are gem dragons, who believe Sardior's fractured consciousness is embedded in their own minds, and who work to cultivate dragonsight in other gem dragons. However, even chromatic and metallic members of the group revere the long-dead Ruby Dragon. Sardior is their once and future sovereign—a leader who has departed for a time, but who will return to bring enlightenment, comfort, and salvation to dragonkind.": "第一世界的继承者们的核心信条是，重生的萨尔迪奥最终将激励巴哈姆特和提亚马特再次联手，重新开始创造的任务。该教派的许多成员都是宝石龙，他们相信萨尔迪奥的断裂意识已经嵌入到他们自己的头脑中，并努力培养其他宝石龙的龙眼。然而，即使是色系和金属系的成员也崇尚早已死去的红宝石龙。萨尔迪奥是他们曾经和未来的君主--一个已经离开了一段时间的领袖，但他会回来为龙族带来启迪、安慰和拯救。",

	"Dragons often take on followers to help them acquire treasure and protect their hoards and lairs. Assigning such subordinates to a dragon is a matter of encounter and adventure design. As you craft an encounter, an adventure, or an entire campaign around a dragon, you can decide how many creatures are in the dragon's service.": "龙经常会带着追随者来帮助他们获取宝藏，保护他们的囤积物和巢穴。为龙指定这样的下属是一个遭遇战和冒险设计的问题。当你围绕龙设计一个遭遇、一个冒险或整个战役时，你可以决定有多少生物为龙服务。",

The dragon's followers are employees, who might be exploited because of their weakness relative to the dragon or treated fairly because of the dragon's kindness. Employees who don't perform up to the dragon's standards are released from service—whether that means being sent off to find other jobs or becoming the dragon's next meal.

These subordinates might be related to the dragon (younger dragons or perhaps half-dragons), or simply employees who have proven trustworthy and resourceful.": "龙可能会将财富投入到企业中，使投资成倍增长。龙的追随者是雇员，他们可能因为相对于龙的弱点而被剥削，也可能因为龙的仁慈而被公平对待。表现不符合龙的标准的员工会被释放--不管是被送去找其他工作还是成为龙的下一顿饭。根据商业企业的规模，龙可能有下属，负责企业的某些方面。这些下属可能与龙有关系（年轻的龙或可能是半龙），或者仅仅是那些被证明值得信赖和足智多谋的雇员。",
	"Dragons sometimes interact with mortal folk as if they were equals—particularly dragons who enjoy taking on Humanoid form. They might create a fellowship or collegial society and treat their companions with kindness and respect. These allies are often unaware that their activities are oriented around the dragon's purposes, becoming unwitting pawns in the dragon's plans. Deep attachments might form between the dragon and these companions, who can become disillusioned when the dragon's true nature is revealed.": "龙有时会与凡人互动，就像他们是平等的一样--尤其是那些喜欢化身为人形的龙。他们可能会建立一个团契或合议庭，以仁慈和尊重的态度对待他们的同伴。这些盟友往往不知道他们的活动是围绕龙的目的进行的，成为龙的计划中不知情的棋子。龙和这些伙伴之间可能会形成深厚的感情，当龙的真实本性被揭露时，这些伙伴可能会感到幻灭。",
	"A dragon takes charge of a criminal enterprise, accumulating wealth through illegal activities that might range from theft and racketeering to smuggling and illegal gambling.

	"Rather than existing on the shadowy fringes of society, a dragon might rule a nation as an absolute monarch. The dragon's word is law—but depending on the dragon, this might be the law of a benevolent autocrat with a cadre of wise advisors or of a dictatorial tyrant who governs based on whim. Taxes might be funneled into the dragon's hoard, but some dragons in this position regard the collective wealth of their empire as part of their hoard and feel no need to consolidate it in specific locations.": "与其说龙存在于社会的阴暗边缘，不如说是以绝对君主的身份统治一个国家。龙的话语就是法律--但根据龙的情况，这可能是一个拥有一批明智顾问的仁慈的专制者的法律，也可能是一个凭一时兴起进行治理的独裁暴君的法律。税收可能被输送到龙的囤积物中，但有些处于这种地位的龙将其帝国的集体财富视为其囤积物的一部分，并认为没有必要将其整合到特定地点。",
	"A dragon emperor might accept fealty from lesser sovereigns and nobles who govern parts of the realm in the dragon's name, or the dragon might install dragon or half-dragon offspring in the highest echelons of government.

	"An emperor might rule openly in dragon form, which discourages aggressive neighbors from provoking the dragon's wrath. Often, though, dragons adopt a Humanoid guise to rule, constructing elaborate ruses (posing as their own children and grandchildren, for example) that allow them to reign across multiple generations.": "一个皇帝可能会以龙的形态公开统治，这样可以阻止咄咄逼人的邻居挑起龙的怒火。但通常情况下，龙会采用人形伪装来进行统治，构建复杂的诡计（例如，冒充自己的子孙），使他们能够跨越多个世代进行统治。",
	"The size of a dragon's territory is irrelevant to the \"emperor\" role. A dragon who acts as a mayor for a small frontier town has the same kind of relationship with the populace as one who rules a continent-spanning nation.": "龙的领土大小与 \"皇帝 \"角色无关。作为边疆小镇市长的龙与民众的关系与统治一个跨越大陆的国家的龙是一样的。",
	"Some dragons demand not just service but worship from their minions. Among Humanoid creatures, kobolds are most likely to treat their dragon patrons as deities, since they typically see dragons as idealized versions of themselves. They bring sacrifices of food and treasure to their dragon gods, indulge in various forms of worship (including groveling when evil dragons are involved), and create tales and hymns to stoke their deities' egos. But other Humanoids might also feel (or at least feign) religious devotion to a dragon, sometimes even manifesting magical power as a result of their piety. (The {@creature dragon blessed|FTD} follower, described in {@book chapter 6|FTD|6|Dragon Blessed}, is an example of a Humanoid manifesting such power.)": "有些龙不仅需要服务，还需要崇拜它们的奴仆。在人形生物中，哥布林最有可能将他们的龙主视为神灵，因为他们通常将龙视为自己的理想化版本。他们向龙神献上食物和财宝，沉溺于各种形式的崇拜（包括在涉及恶龙时卑躬屈膝），并创作故事和赞美诗来激起他们神灵的自负。但其他人形生物也可能对龙感到（或至少假装）虔诚，有时甚至会因为他们的虔诚而表现出神奇的力量。({@book chapter 6|FTD|6|Dragon Blessed}中描述的{@creature dragon blessed|FTD}追随者，就是一个人形生物表现出这种力量的例子。)",
	"Dragons can be benevolent patrons who genuinely care for those who worship them, scheming manipulators who view devotion as a means of domination and control, or something in between. All dragon gods, however, have devoted minions who are difficult to sway from their service. One key to this devotion is the fact that a dragon's power is more concrete than the power of most gods; the supernatural fear inspired by a dragon's presence readily translates into reverence among the followers.": "龙可以是真正关心崇拜他们的人的仁慈的守护者，也可以是将奉献视为统治和控制手段的阴险的操纵者，或者介于两者之间。然而，所有的龙神都有忠实的奴仆，他们很难从他们的服务中动摇。这种奉献的一个关键是，龙的力量比大多数神的力量更具体；龙的存在所激发的超自然的恐惧很容易转化为信徒们的崇敬。",
	"Some dragons aspire to a life of luxury, surrounded by minions whose primary purpose is to ensure their every need is met immediately. A dragon living in Humanoid form might actually claim a noble title and hobnob with other members of the aristocracy. However, dragons in this category often prefer to avoid the hassles of secrets and disguises, focusing instead on extravagance—and demanding treasure as tribute from nearby settlements. Their minions are menial servants, responsible for bringing them food, keeping them comfortable, tending to their lairs, and warding off intruders. One or more of these servitors might have the responsibility of managing the rest of a dragon noble's staff on the dragon's behalf, but even such a steward has little autonomy and must cater to the dragon's every whim.": "有些龙渴望过上奢华的生活，身边的奴仆主要是为了确保他们的每一个需求都能立即得到满足。以类人形态生活的龙可能真的会宣称自己有一个贵族头衔，并与其他贵族成员一起玩耍。然而，这种类型的龙往往喜欢避免秘密和伪装的麻烦，而是专注于奢侈--要求附近的定居点提供宝物作为贡品。他们的奴仆是琐碎的仆人，负责给他们送食物，让他们保持舒适，照看他们的巢穴，并抵御入侵者。这些仆人中的一个或多个可能有责任代表龙管理龙族贵族的其他工作人员，但即使这样的管家也没有什么自主权，必须迎合龙的每一个奇思妙想。",
	"Some dragons treat their followers and minions like their children. These followers might be a dragon's devoted dragon or half-dragon offspring, but it's more likely that these minions are a family the dragon has adopted out of generosity, compassion, or manipulation.": "有些龙对待他们的追随者和奴才就像他们的孩子一样。这些追随者可能是龙的忠实龙或半龙的后代，但更有可能的是，这些爪牙是龙出于慷慨、怜悯或操纵而收养的家庭。",
	"Unlike most other relationships between dragons and followers, this one is primarily about the well-being and advancement of the followers, not the dragon. Dragons are notoriously egotistical even when they're benevolent, but some make sacrifices for weaker creatures they see as family, regardless of their exact relationship to the creatures.": "与其他大多数龙和追随者之间的关系不同，这种关系主要是为了追随者的福祉和进步，而不是龙。龙是出了名的自负，即使它们是仁慈的，但有些龙会为它们视为家人的弱小生物做出牺牲，不管它们与这些生物的确切关系如何。",
	"To outsiders, dragons in this sort of relationship might be mistaken for pets or servitors. But dragons never forget their own power and importance, even when helping other creatures, and dragons' \"children\" might face serious consequences if they forget who's in charge.": "对外人来说，处于这种关系的龙可能会被误认为是宠物或仆人。但龙永远不会忘记自己的力量和重要性，即使在帮助其他生物时也是如此，如果龙的 \"孩子 \"忘记了谁是负责人，他们可能会面临严重的后果。",
	"Dragons might take on the role of patron, using a fraction of their tremendous wealth to support the arts, groups of freelance adventurers, or important causes. Such dragons' minions might include artists painting frescoes in their lairs, musicians composing chorales for the dragons to enjoy, poets writing odes in praise of their draconic lieges, and adventurers seeking priceless treasures to add to the dragons' hoards. Dragons who spend a lot of time in Humanoid form are often drawn to this role, and their minions might have no idea that their generous patrons are actually dragons.": "龙可能会扮演赞助人的角色，用他们巨大财富的一小部分来支持艺术、自由冒险者团体或重要的事业。这些龙的爪牙可能包括在他们的巢穴里画壁画的艺术家、为龙创作合唱曲的音乐家、为赞美他们的龙族统治者而写的诗人，以及寻找无价之宝以增加龙的囤积物的冒险者。经常以类人形态出现的龙经常被吸引到这个角色，他们的奴仆可能不知道他们慷慨的赞助人其实是龙。",
	"If you want to have a dragon act as a patron for a group of adventurers, look to the \"{@book Group Patrons|TCE|16}\" chapter of {@book Tasha's Cauldron of Everything|TCE}. You can use the information there to create a dragon filling this role in your campaign. Dragons naturally fall into the category of \"{@book ancient being|TCE|2|Ancient Being},\" as described in that chapter, but depending on their roles and personalities, they might act more like another kind of patron.": "如果你想让一条龙作为一群冒险者的守护者，请参考(%%)的\"{@book Group Patrons|TCE|16} \"章节。你可以使用那里的信息来创建一条龙，在你的活动中扮演这个角色。龙自然属于\"{@book ancient being|TCE|2|Ancient Being} \"类别，如该章所述，但根据它们的角色和个性，它们可能更像另一种赞助人。",
	"The oldest dragons are deep wellsprings of knowledge, drawing on vast experience that might extend beyond a single world of the Material Plane to encompass multiple realities. Though some dragons hoard their knowledge like treasure, others enjoy passing their knowledge on to other creatures. Such dragons might establish schools or monasteries, take on individual students or groups of disciples, or pose as Humanoid scholars to teach in universities. These dragons might believe that educating lesser creatures is the responsibility of the great. Others want a higher class of minion and believe education is the best way to achieve that. Still others simply enjoy teaching or believe the world is improved by having an educated populace.": "最古老的龙是知识的源泉，它们汲取了大量的经验，这些经验可能超越了物质界的单一世界，涵盖了多个现实世界。虽然有些龙像藏宝一样囤积他们的知识，但其他龙则喜欢把他们的知识传给其他生物。这些龙可能会建立学校或寺院，招收个别学生或弟子团体，或冒充类人学者在大学里授课。这些龙可能认为，教育低等生物是伟大的责任。还有人想要更高等级的奴仆，并相信教育是实现这一目标的最佳途径。还有一些人只是喜欢教学，或者相信世界会因为有一个受过教育的民众而得到改善。",
	"The combination of ego and intellect can lead a dragon to become a military leader. Minions help keep the dragon's territory in an iron grip, bringing the spoils of conquest and the tribute of conquered peoples to swell the dragon's hoard. Those minions might be Humanoids, violent monsters, or a mix of both, forming an alliance under the dragon's rule.": "自负和智慧的结合可以使龙成为一个军事领袖。仆人们帮助龙的领土保持在一个铁的控制之下，带来征服的战利品和被征服的人民的贡品，以扩大龙的囤积物。这些爪牙可能是人形生物，也可能是暴力的怪物，或者两者的混合体，在龙的统治下形成一个联盟。",
	"Depending on the dragon's age and the power and number of minions involved, a dragon warlord might be a local menace or an imperial conqueror.": "根据龙的年龄以及所涉及的权力和爪牙的数量，龙王可能是一个地方性的威胁，也可能是一个帝国的征服者。",

	"Dragons (particularly adult and older dragons) are well suited to being the climactic encounter in an adventure, and slaying evil dragons is a well-established quest in literature and legend. But you can also use a dragon as just one of many encounters to overcome in an adventure.": "龙（尤其是成年龙和老龙）很适合作为冒险中的高潮遭遇，而且杀死恶龙是文学和传说中的一个既定任务。但你也可以把龙作为冒险中要克服的众多遭遇中的一个。",
	"Not every encounter with a dragon needs to involve combat, let alone an all-out fight to the death. Maybe the characters are trying to help a kobold Keeper of Dragons retrieve a wyrmling kidnapped by a gang of goblins (as in \"{@adventure The Sunless Citadel|TftYP|0},\" an adventure found in {@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP}). In this case, fighting the dragon might be necessary if the dragon doesn't want to return, but killing the creature is undesirable. Or perhaps the characters are seriously outmatched by the dragon, and their only reasonable goal is to escape the encounter alive.": "并非每一次与龙的相遇都需要涉及战斗，更不用说全面的生死之战了。也许角色们正试图帮助一个哥布林龙守护者找回被一帮地精绑架的巫妖（如\"{@adventure The Sunless Citadel|TftYP|0}\"，一个在{@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP}中发现的冒险）。在这种情况下，如果龙不愿意回来，与龙战斗可能是必要的，但杀死这个生物是不可取的。也可能是人物严重不敌巨龙，他们唯一合理的目标是活着逃离这场遭遇战。",
	"Fighting in a dragon's lair is more likely to mean a fight to the death, since the dragon will be less keen on fleeing an encounter that goes badly and more determined to hunt down adventurers who flee after seeing the inside of the dragon's home. This scenario also means an adult or older dragon has access to lair actions. In contrast, a dragon fighting outdoors can more easily fly out of reach of opponents on the ground. {@book Chapters 4|FTD|4} and {@book 5|FTD|5} feature information and maps to help you build encounters in and around a dragon's lair.": "在龙的巢穴中战斗更有可能意味着一场生死之战，因为龙不太愿意在遭遇不测时逃跑，而是更坚决地追杀那些在看到龙的家的内部后逃跑的冒险者。这种情况也意味着成年或年长的龙有机会进行巢穴行动。相比之下，在户外作战的龙可以更容易地飞出地面上对手的范围。{@book Chapters 4|FTD|4}和{@book 5|FTD|5}的信息和地图可以帮助你在龙的巢穴内和周围建立遭遇战。",
	"With their legendary actions, adult and ancient dragons are designed to be challenging encounters all on their own, but even a younger dragon can be a handful as a solo enemy. On the other hand, adding minions to a dragon encounter can divert the characters' attention away from the dragon and make a combat encounter more interesting—as well as more dangerous. See \"{@book Followers|FTD|3|Followers}\" earlier in this chapter for ideas about how the relationship between dragon and minions can impact an encounter.": "成年龙和古龙具有传奇性的行动，它们被设计为单独的挑战性遭遇，但即使是年轻的龙，作为一个单独的敌人也是很棘手的。另一方面，在龙的遭遇战中加入小兵，可以将角色的注意力从龙身上转移开，使战斗的遭遇战更加有趣--也更加危险。参见本章前面的\"{@book Followers|FTD|3|Followers}\"，了解龙和小兵之间的关系如何影响一场遭遇战。",
	"With these four questions in mind, you can look to the Dragon Encounter Complications table for suggestions of quirks, special effects, and unusual situations that can make any dragon encounter more interesting and exciting.": "考虑到这四个问题，你可以从 \"遭遇龙 \"的复杂情况表中获得关于怪异、特殊效果和不寻常情况的建议，这些建议可以使任何遭遇龙的情况更加有趣和刺激。",
	"The dragon has no interest in fighting and tries to avoid the characters, until they anger the dragon through significantly injury or insult.": "龙对战斗没有兴趣，并试图避开这些人物，直到他们通过明显的伤害或侮辱激怒了龙。",

	"The dragon tries to drive the characters off by emotionally hurting or humiliating them—threatening something they obviously care about, damaging their equipment, insulting them, or showing how ineffectual their attacks are.": "龙试图通过情感上的伤害或羞辱来赶走人物--威胁他们明显关心的东西，破坏他们的设备，侮辱他们，或显示他们的攻击是多么的无效。",
	"The dragon has a way to call for help hidden deep inside the lair, such as a magic horn that summons minions, an {@item iron flask} with a powerful Fiend inside, or a magic portal to an echo's lair. The characters must prevent the dragon from summoning aid or face a new threat.": "龙的巢穴深处有一种呼救的方式，比如一个能召唤爪牙的魔角，一个里面有强大魔物的{@item iron flask}，或者一个通往回声巢穴的魔法门。人物必须阻止龙召唤援助，否则将面临新的威胁。",
	"The dragon is desperately trying to protect a particular treasure, one or more eggs, or perhaps a minion, bargaining to protect this treasure and flying into a rage if it is harmed.": "这条龙正拼命地保护某件宝物，一个或多个蛋，也可能是一个奴仆，为保护这件宝物而讨价还价，如果它受到伤害就会飞快地发怒。",
	"The previous occupant of the dragon's lair left behind a curse, a trap, or a lingering spirit that clever characters can turn against the dragon.": "龙的巢穴的前主人留下了一个诅咒、一个陷阱或一个挥之不去的灵魂，聪明的人物可以将其用于对付龙。",
	"The dragon's lair is almost impossible to navigate without access to one or more of the dragon's special movement modes (typically flight, but possibly burrowing, swimming, or climbing).": "如果不能使用龙的一种或多种特殊运动模式（通常是飞行，但也可能是钻洞、游泳或攀爬），龙的巢穴几乎不可能航行。",
	"It's been so long since anyone has dared to intrude on the dragon's lair that the dragon is more interested in showing off the lair—and impressive lair actions—than in doing serious harm to the characters. If the characters escape and spread stories of the dragon's grandeur, so much the better.": "已经很久没有人敢闯入龙的巢穴了，以至于龙对炫耀巢穴和令人印象深刻的巢穴行动更感兴趣，而不是对人物造成严重伤害。如果这些人物逃脱了，并传播了关于龙的伟大的故事，那就更好了。",
	"When the dragon is agitated, the regional effects that alter the terrain around the lair create visible changes around the dragon each round.": "当龙被激怒时，改变巢穴周围地形的区域效应每轮都会在龙的周围产生明显的变化。",
	"Factions and grudges within the ranks of the dragon's minions erupt when the characters challenge the dragon, resulting in infighting that might tip the odds in the main battle in either direction.": "当人物向龙挑战时，龙的爪牙队伍中的派别和怨恨就会爆发，导致内讧，可能会使主战的胜算向任何方向倾斜。",
	"A feature in the dragon's lair has an unpredictable magical effect, perhaps similar to a {@item wand of wonder}, a sorcerer's {@table Wild Magic Surge|PHB}, or a {@book dungeon trick|DMG|10|Random Tricks} as described in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. The dragon avoids the feature unless the encounter is going badly, then either activates the feature or tries to goad the characters into doing so.": "龙的巢穴中的一个特征具有不可预测的魔法效果，也许类似于{@item wand of wonder}、巫师的{@table Wild Magic Surge|PHB}或{@book dungeon trick|DMG|10|Random Tricks}，如{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中所述。除非遭遇战进展不顺利，否则龙会避开该功能，然后要么启动该功能，要么试图诱导角色这样做。",
	"Spell effects and breath weapons used inside the dragon's lair cause dramatic destruction, including chasms opening up, ceilings collapsing, pillars toppling, and other effects that can damage or hinder the characters and the dragon equally.": "在龙的巢穴内使用的法术效果和呼吸武器会造成戏剧性的破坏，包括裂缝打开、天花板坍塌、柱子倒塌，以及其他能对人物和龙造成同样伤害或阻碍的效果。",
	"The dragon has a rival who notices the characters approaching the dragon's lair and keeps tabs on the fight. This rival might step in to help the characters or the dragon, depending on the circumstances, or might ambush the characters when they leave the dragon's lair.": "龙有一个对手，他注意到人物接近龙的巢穴，并监视着这场战斗。根据情况，这个对手可能会出面帮助角色或龙，也可能在角色离开龙的巢穴时伏击他们。",
	"The dragon takes tremendous pleasure in adopting Humanoid form and pretending to be a minion, groveling and sniveling when intruders enter the lair and claiming that the dragon is away.": "这条龙非常喜欢采用人形，并假装是一个奴仆，当入侵者进入巢穴时，它卑躬屈膝，声称龙不在。",
	"The dragon's only goal is to learn a key piece of information about the characters' larger goals and then escape.": "龙的唯一目标是了解有关人物更大目标的一个关键信息，然后逃跑。",
	"The dragon enjoys combat, roaring in appreciation each time the characters pull off effective attacks or flashy spells. But if seriously hurt, the dragon quickly calls for a truce.": "龙喜欢战斗，每当角色完成有效的攻击或华丽的法术时，它就会发出赞赏的吼声。但如果受到严重伤害，龙会迅速要求停战。",
	"Each round of combat with the dragon, the characters catch an eerie glimpse of another world where one of the dragon's echoes is active.": "在与龙的每一轮战斗中，角色们都能瞥见另一个世界的阴森景象，那里有龙的一个回声在活动。",
	"The dragon has a plan to feign death in case of attack—apparently being buried in a cave-in, tumbling into a deep chasm, drowning in lava, or some similarly dramatic exit. After escaping, the dragon plots revenge.": "龙有一个计划，在受到攻击时假装死亡--显然是被埋在山洞里，翻入深渊，淹没在岩浆中，或一些类似的戏剧性的出口。逃出后，龙计划进行报复。",

	"When you want a dragon encounter to be the goal or focal point of an entire adventure, how do you craft that adventure to highlight the dragon's importance, grandeur, and terrifying power?

Think about those categories as you consider the role you want a dragon to play in your adventure.": "当你想让龙的遭遇成为整个冒险的目标或焦点时，你如何精心设计这个冒险来突出龙的重要性、宏伟性和可怕的力量？当你使用本书中的冒险钩子时，龙将大致分为三种角色：怪物、阴谋家或权力。当你考虑要让龙在你的冒险中扮演什么角色时，请考虑这些类别。",
	"For all their vast power, great intellect, and range of possible motivations, dragons are often simple creatures at heart. They want food, a secure lair, and treasure. Many tropes of the fantasy genre revolve around dealing with a dragon who has become too monstrous and putting an end to the danger the dragon poses to peoples and civilizations.": "尽管龙拥有巨大的力量、强大的智力和一系列可能的动机，但它们的内心往往是简单的生物。它们想要食物、安全的巢穴和财宝。奇幻小说的许多套路都是围绕着处理已经变得过于畸形的龙，以及结束龙对人民和文明构成的危险而展开的。",

	"A dragon has displaced an entire population to make a lair in the ruins of what was once a great city or stronghold. The people displaced want their home back, so the dragon must be removed. Killing the dragon is not necessarily the goal, but it's certainly one way to solve the problem.": "一条龙把所有的人都赶走了，在曾经的大城市或据点的废墟上做了一个巢穴。流离失所的人们想要回他们的家园，所以必须将龙赶走。杀死龙不一定是目的，但这肯定是解决问题的方法之一。",
	"The dragon's hoard contains unimaginable wealth—or perhaps one powerful artifact the characters desperately need to achieve some other goal. Slaying the dragon might be one option, but sneaking into the lair and stealing what the characters seek is another. The characters could even bargain with the dragon to acquire the needed item. Alternatively, a dragon might seek adventurers to recover items stolen from the dragon's hoard—with a threat that local folk will suffer if the characters fail.": "龙的囤积物中包含着难以想象的财富，或者是角色们为实现其他目标而迫切需要的一件强大的神器。杀死龙可能是一种选择，但潜入龙的巢穴，偷取人物所寻求的东西是另一种选择。人物甚至可以与龙讨价还价，以获得所需的物品。另外，龙可能会寻找冒险者来找回从龙的仓库里偷来的物品--并威胁说如果角色失败，当地人就会遭殃。",
	"Most of the adventure hooks in this book involve the schemes a dragon might put into motion over the course of a long life, potentially using followers as agents in the world. In practice, many of a schemer dragon's goals might be the same as a monstrous dragon's: acquiring food, securing a lair, and adding to a hoard. But other plots might revolve around acquiring minions, advancing the cause of a draconic faction, building the dragon's prestige, working for the well-being of dragonkind as a whole, or altering the nature of the world and its magic.": "本书中的大多数冒险钩子涉及龙在漫长的一生中可能实施的计划，可能利用追随者作为世界的代理人。在实践中，谋士龙的许多目标可能与畸形龙的目标相同：获取食物、确保巢穴、增加囤积物。但其他阴谋可能是围绕着获取爪牙、推进龙族派系的事业、建立龙的威望、为整个龙族的福祉而努力，或者改变世界的性质和魔法。",
	"A dragon's schemes become the basis for an adventure when they intersect with the characters' lives. Most directly, the characters might be asked to aid the dragon's schemes or to oppose them. The Cross Purposes table provides inspiration to help you turn dragon-related adventure hooks into adventures that impact the characters in your game.": "当龙的计划与人物的生活发生交集时，它们就成为冒险的基础。最直接的是，角色可能被要求帮助龙的计划或反对它们。交叉目的表提供了灵感，帮助你把与龙有关的冒险钩子变成影响游戏中人物的冒险。",

A powerful dragon's schemes impact the characters because those schemes impact the world as a whole, not because the dragon is interested in the characters individually—at least not initially. As the characters become powers in their own right, dragons are more likely to take personal notice of them.": "在某些地方，龙不仅仅是怪物或策划者。他们是推动者和摇摆者，他们的欲望塑造了历史的进程。强大的龙的计划会影响人物，因为这些计划会影响整个世界，而不是因为龙对人物个人感兴趣--至少最初不是。当人物成为他们自己的力量时，龙就更有可能对他们进行个人关注。",
	"The \"{@book Dragon Campaigns|FTD|3|Dragon Campaigns}\" section that follows discusses the world-ranging implications of putting dragons in positions of power and central story importance in your game. When crafting individual adventures in the context of such a campaign, take standard adventure hooks (in this book or elsewhere) and dial them up—amplifying the scale and significance of a dragon's schemes to make those plots fit the dragon's stature in the world. Imagine the dragon's hoard on the scale of a national treasury. Think of the dragon's minions as the entire nation or religion that owes the dragon allegiance.": "接下来的\"{@book Dragon Campaigns|FTD|3|Dragon Campaigns} \"部分讨论了在你的游戏中把龙放在权力位置和故事中心的重要性所带来的世界范围的影响。在这样的战役背景下制作个人冒险时，采用标准的冒险钩子（在本书或其他地方）并将其放大--放大龙的计划的规模和意义，使这些情节符合龙在世界中的地位。想象一下，龙的囤积物有如国库一般规模。把龙的爪牙想象成向龙效忠的整个国家或宗教。",
	"Adventures at this scale might involve dragons as villains or as patrons, and they might well involve multiple dragons in conflict with each other. The characters might loyally serve one dragon in opposition to another, or they might attempt to play multiple dragons against one another—perhaps earning the ire of them all.": "在这种规模的冒险中，龙可能是反派，也可能是赞助人，它们很可能涉及到多条龙之间的冲突。角色们可能会忠心耿耿地为一条龙服务，与另一条龙作对，或者他们可能试图让多条龙互相对抗--也许会招致它们的愤怒。",
	"Dragons occupy a prominent place in most D&D worlds, but in some realms, they are central to a world's story. Consider these three examples.": "龙在大多数D&D世界中都占据着重要位置，但在某些领域，龙是世界故事的核心。请看这三个例子。",
	"The Io's Blood isles are a vast domain governed by an assembly of ancient wyrms representing eighty-eight clans of chromatic, metallic, and gem dragons. The council's subjects include dozens of Humanoid peoples, some of whom serve as closely bonded aides to dragon masters.": "艾欧血岛是一个巨大的领域，由代表八十八个色龙、金属龙和宝石龙氏族的古巫师议会管理。议会的臣民包括几十个类人族，其中一些人作为龙主的亲密助手。",
	"In the multiverse of the Magic: The Gathering trading card game, five dragonlords rule supreme over the world of Tarkir. After centuries of battle between Humanoid clans and the ancient dragonlords and their broods, the dragons triumphed and claimed dominion over the clans, which now bear the dragons' names.": "在《魔法：集会》交易卡游戏的多元宇宙中，五位龙王统治着塔克尔世界的最高权力。在人形氏族和古代龙王及其子嗣之间经过几个世纪的战斗后，龙取得了胜利，并声称对各氏族拥有统治权，这些氏族现在都有龙的名字。",
	"If you want to build a campaign that puts dragons in a similarly prominent role, consider any of the following options.": "如果你想建立一个将龙放在类似的突出位置的活动，可以考虑以下任何一个选项。",
	"The {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} includes a discussion of {@book world-shaking events|DMG|1|World-Shaking Events} that might define turning points at the start, middle, or end of a campaign. One way to give dragons a prominent role in your campaign is to apply a draconic twist to any of these events.": "{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}包括对{@book world-shaking events|DMG|1|World-Shaking Events}的讨论，这些讨论可能会在战役的开始、中间或结束时确定转折点。让龙在你的战役中发挥突出作用的一个方法是对这些事件中的任何一个应用龙族的扭曲。",
	"A powerful dragon establishing a new lair in a region can be a singularly impactful event. Likewise, the death of an ancient dragon can cause dramatic changes in the world. The balance of power shifts. Established territories are suddenly contested or might be undefended against other perils. The dragon's hoard represents tremendous wealth flowing through a single region. Entire populations of Humanoids or monsters might move in or out of the dragon's territory.": "一条强大的龙在一个地区建立了新的巢穴，这可能是一个具有独特影响的事件。同样地，一条古龙的死亡也会引起世界的巨大变化。权力的平衡发生了变化。已有的领土突然被争夺，或可能无法抵御其他危险。龙的囤积物代表着巨大的财富在一个地区流动。整个人形生物或怪物的人口可能会迁入或迁出龙的领土。",
	"A dragon rampaging through inhabited lands can be worse than any natural disaster. What has stirred the dragon's wrath? Will these rampages continue? What might appease the creature?": "一条龙在有人居住的土地上横冲直撞，可能比任何自然灾害更可怕。是什么激起了龙的怒火？这些横冲直撞的行为会继续下去吗？什么可以安抚这个生物？",
	"A dragon might attack a stronghold of civilization, or an army marching under Tiamat's banner with dragon riders wheeling overhead could begin the conquest of a neighboring realm. Or a dragon's minions might launch an attack in preparation for the dragon establishing a new lair.": "一条龙可能会攻击一个文明的据点，或者一支军队在蒂亚马特的旗帜下行军，头顶上有龙骑士在飞驰，可能会开始征服一个邻近的王国。或者，龙的爪牙可能会发动攻击，为龙建立新的巢穴做准备。",
	"A dragon who is a political or religious leader might face a rebellion. Another dragon might even rise up to lead the freedom fighters.": "作为政治或宗教领袖的龙可能会面临叛乱。另一条龙甚至可能崛起，领导自由战士。",
	"If dragons are on the verge of extinction, the last survivors might become extremely important to your campaign. Alternatively, people might have long believed dragons to be extinct, only to be shocked when one or more of these mythical creatures emerge from hiding or a long hibernation. What drove them away, and what is bringing them back? Another possibility is that dragons are responsible for the near-extinction of some other kind of creature or the depletion of a resource. What if gold or magic items are scarce because dragons have collected almost all such wealth in their hoards?": "如果龙濒临灭绝，最后的幸存者可能会对你的竞选活动变得极为重要。另外，人们可能长期以来一直认为龙已经灭绝了，但当这些神话中的一个或多个生物从隐蔽处或长期的冬眠中出现时，人们才感到震惊。是什么驱使它们离开，又是什么让它们回来？另一种可能性是，龙要对其他种类的生物濒临灭绝或资源枯竭负责。如果黄金或魔法物品稀缺，因为龙在它们的囤积中几乎收集了所有这些财富呢？",
	"The new organization might be one of the dragon organizations described earlier in this chapter or a dragon faction similar to those discussed in the next section. Alternatively, any apparently ordinary organization might have a dragon at its head—a shape-shifter dragon leading a thieves' guild, perhaps, or a devout dragon stirring up zealots in Bahamut's name.": "新组织可能是本章前面描述的龙族组织之一，或者是类似于下一节讨论的龙族派别。另外，任何表面上普通的组织都有可能以龙为首--也许是领导盗贼公会的变形龙，或者是以巴哈姆特的名义煽动狂热分子的虔诚龙。",
	"The discovery in question might involve dragons directly. People might have only just learned that dragons exist, discovered the enormous wealth stored in their hoards, or learned of a magical reaction that can be sparked by the use of dragon blood or scales. Alternatively, dragons might be among the creatures competing to possess or control a new discovery.": "有关的发现可能直接涉及龙。人们可能刚刚才知道龙的存在，发现龙的囤积物中储存着巨大的财富，或者了解到使用龙的血液或鳞片可以引发神奇的反应。另外，龙也可能是争相占有或控制一项新发现的生物之一。",
	"A prophecy might deal with any of the other kinds of events described here, with dragons as its focus. Alternatively, the prophecy might be uttered by a dragon or read and interpreted primarily by dragons (like the Draconic Prophecy in the world of Eberron).": "一个预言可能涉及这里描述的任何其他类型的事件，并以龙作为其焦点。另外，预言可能是由龙说出来的，或者主要由龙来阅读和解释（如Eberron世界中的Draconic预言）。",
	"Draconic factions and the conflicts between them can provide a useful framework to organize your entire campaign around. Characters might swear their allegiance to a dragon or trade their services to dragons in exchange for membership in a draconic faction. By joining one dragon's faction, characters might end up locked in bitter strife with a different faction—and characters who join different dragon factions might have to carefully balance the needs of those factions against the goals of their party.": "龙族派别和它们之间的冲突可以提供一个有用的框架来组织你的整个战役。角色可能会宣誓效忠于某条龙，或者用他们对龙的服务来换取龙族派别的成员资格。通过加入一个龙的派别，角色可能最终被锁定在与另一个派别的激烈争斗中--而加入不同龙派别的角色可能不得不小心翼翼地平衡这些派别的需求与他们党派的目标。",
	"The different ways dragons can be categorized suggest numerous approaches to organizing dragon factions in your world.": "龙的不同分类方式表明，在你的世界中组织龙的派系有许多方法。",
	"Perhaps the chromatic dragons in your world are a force of chaos, with five factions of metallic dragons shouldering the responsibility for organizing Humanoid forces to battle their chromatic kin. These factions are devoted to common goals—constraining the rampages of the chromatic dragons and limiting Tiamat's influence in the world—but they have different methods, adhere to different ideals, and attract different kinds of members. The Silver Order might be a chivalric order that attracts paladins and fighters, holds its members to the highest standards of behavior, and wields cold magic. The Brass Order could be a loose affiliation of good-hearted scoundrels, including rogues and bards, who favor fire magic and trickery.": "也许在你的世界里，铬化龙是一股混乱的力量，有五个金属龙派系肩负着组织人形力量与铬化龙的亲属作战的责任。这些派别都致力于共同的目标--约束色龙的横行，限制提亚马特在这个世界上的影响--但他们有不同的方法，坚持不同的理想，并吸引不同类型的成员。白银骑士团可能是一个吸引圣骑士和战士的骑士团，要求其成员遵守最高的行为标准，并施展冷酷的魔法。黄铜骑士团可能是一个由心地善良的恶棍组成的松散联盟，包括流氓和吟游诗人，他们喜欢火魔法和诡计。",
	"An adventuring party might include members of any or all of the five Metallic Orders, each concerned with advancing the cause of their own order while cooperating in pursuit of common goals.": "一个冒险团可能包括五个金属教团中的任何一个或所有成员，每个人都关心推进自己教团的事业，同时为追求共同的目标而合作。",
	"Alternatively, each family of dragons—chromatic, metallic, and gem—could be represented by a single faction. Each draconic faction has a particular set of goals that doesn't necessarily put it in direct conflict with the other two factions, but that doesn't always inspire cooperation. For example, the Chromatic Circle might focus on self-aggrandizement, as each member of the faction tries to amass as much wealth and power as possible. The Gem Circle, by contrast, might be dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge, while the Metallic Circle is more altruistic, working to further the advancement of entire societies and civilizations.": "另外，每个龙族--有色、金属和宝石--都可以由一个派别代表。每个龙族派别都有一套特定的目标，不一定与其他两个派别有直接冲突，但也不一定能激发合作。例如，铬圈可能专注于自我膨胀，因为该派系的每个成员都试图尽可能多地积累财富和权力。相比之下，宝石圈可能致力于追求知识，而金属圈则更加利他，致力于推动整个社会和文明的发展。",
	"Some groups of characters might all affiliate with a single circle, while others might include members of different circles. Different affiliations don't necessarily create conflict within a party, though. Rather, those affiliations create a potentially interesting tension between individual goals and the goals of the party as a whole.": "有些团体的人物可能都隶属于一个圈子，而其他团体可能包括不同圈子的成员。不过，不同的隶属关系并不一定会在党内产生冲突。相反，这些附属关系在个人目标和整个政党的目标之间创造了一种潜在的有趣的紧张关系。",
	"Your world might have numerous dragon overlords—one for each kind of metallic, chromatic, and gem dragon, and possibly for deep dragons, dragon turtles, faerie dragons, moonstone dragons, and shadow dragons. These overlords are the oldest and most powerful of their kinds, and all other dragons of the same kind owe allegiance to them. In addition, Humanoids who know what's good for them give their allegiance to a dragon overlord in exchange for the dragon's protection. The result might be a feudal society, where dragons fill the highest ranks of the aristocracy.": "你的世界可能有许多龙的霸主--每一种金属龙、染色龙和宝石龙，可能还有深海龙、龙龟、精灵龙、月石龙和影子龙。这些霸主是他们种类中最古老和最强大的，所有其他同类的龙都要向他们效忠。此外，知道什么对自己有利的人族会向龙的霸主效忠，以换取龙的保护。其结果可能是一个封建社会，龙充斥着最高等级的贵族。",
	"In such a setting, characters need to decide how they fit into this system of fealty. Some characters might swear allegiance to a dragon overlord and end up as important agents enforcing that dragon's will in the world—perhaps even to the point of joining a war against a different overlord. Or they could remain independent, traveling from one dragon's domain to another and dealing with the complex and sometimes violent political conflicts among overlords. If different characters owe allegiance to different dragons, they might cooperate smoothly for a while but then find themselves in conflict when tensions erupt between the overlords. Such characters might then be put in the position of trying to make peace between the dragons—before they're commanded to go to war against each other!": "在这样的背景下，角色需要决定他们如何融入这种效忠体系。有些角色可能会宣誓效忠于某个龙族霸主，并最终成为在这个世界上执行该龙族意志的重要代理人--也许甚至会加入到对抗不同霸主的战争中。或者他们可以保持独立，从一个龙的领地到另一个龙的领地，处理复杂的、有时是暴力的霸主之间的政治冲突。如果不同的角色效忠于不同的龙，他们可能会顺利合作一段时间，但当霸主之间爆发紧张局势时，他们会发现自己处于冲突之中。这样的角色可能会被置于试图在龙之间实现和平的位置--在他们被命令互相开战之前！这时，他们可能会被要求在龙之间进行和平。",
	"Dragon factions can be based on many other aspects of dragon identity in addition to those above. The five dragon-ruled clans of Tarkir, for example, each identify with one aspect of draconic nature—the scale, the fang, the claw, the wing, and the eye, representing endurance, ruthlessness, savagery, speed, and cunning, respectively. You could also create factions based around the damage types dealt by different dragons' breath weapons, so a fire-based faction would include red, gold, and brass dragons, while green dragons would have a poison-based faction all to themselves. The gem dragons would also be unique in this system.": "除上述内容外，龙族的派别还可以基于龙族身份的许多其他方面。例如，塔克尔的五个龙族，每个都认同龙族本性的一个方面--鳞片、獠牙、爪子、翅膀和眼睛，分别代表耐力、无情、野蛮、速度和狡猾。你还可以根据不同龙的呼吸武器所造成的伤害类型来创建派别，因此以火为基础的派别将包括红龙、金龙和铜龙，而绿龙将有一个自己的以毒为基础的派别。在这个系统中，宝石龙也将是独一无二的。",
	"Alternatively, you could build draconic factions around ideals and goals that aren't specifically draconic, perhaps applying a dragon overlay to the ten guilds of Ravnica or Humanoid factions active in Faerûn—such the Harpers, the Order of the Gauntlet, the Emerald Enclave, the Lords' Alliance, and the Zhentarim, all of which have appeared in a number of D&D adventures.": "另外，你也可以围绕并非专门针对龙族的理想和目标建立龙族派别，也许可以将龙族的元素叠加到拉夫尼卡的十大行会或活跃在法鲁恩的人形派别中--比如哈珀人、高塔骑士团、翡翠飞地、领主联盟和赞塔林，这些都曾出现在许多D&D冒险中。",
	"Moving from the realm of temporal power to the spiritual domain, dragons can also fill the role of gods in a campaign world, elevated to a central role in the beliefs and myths of your setting. The two most important gods in the Dragonlance setting—Paladine and Takhisis—are identified with Bahamut and Tiamat, though they are not always worshiped in dragon form. Similarly, the gods of the Sovereign Host and the Dark Six in Eberron are sometimes described as dragons and might be dragons who ascended to godhood.": "从世俗的力量领域转移到精神领域，龙也可以在战役世界中扮演神的角色，在你设定的信仰和神话中被提升到核心地位。在《龙之谷》的设定中，两个最重要的神--帕拉丁和塔克西丝--被认为是巴哈姆特和提亚马特，尽管他们并不总是以龙的形态被崇拜。同样地，埃伯龙的主神和黑暗六神有时也被描述为龙，而且可能是升为神的龙。",
	"On the other hand, the dragon gods of your campaign might be ever present in the world and fully involved in the lives of their worshipers. You could reimagine the gods of Theros (detailed in {@book Mythic Odysseys of Theros|MOT}) as dragons, so shining Heliod becomes a gold dragon, Erebos becomes a black dracolich, Thassa is a dragon turtle, and so on. These dragon gods might grant supernatural gifts to their followers in exchange for devotion, potentially even transforming their favored ones into dragonborn. You could draw on the supernatural gifts described in {@book chapter 2|FTD|2|Draconic Gifts} as well as the {@book piety benefits|MOT|2|Benefits of Piety} detailed in {@book Mythic Odysseys of Theros|MOT} for inspiration.": "另一方面，你的战役中的龙神可能永远存在于这个世界上，并完全参与到他们崇拜者的生活中。你可以把泰罗斯的诸神（详见{@book Mythic Odysseys of Theros|MOT}）重新想象成龙，于是闪亮的赫利奥德变成了一条金龙，埃雷波斯变成了一只黑色的龙王，塔萨是一只龙龟，等等。这些龙神可能会授予他们的追随者超自然的礼物，以换取他们的虔诚，甚至有可能将他们所喜爱的人变成龙族。你可以从{@book chapter 2|FTD|2|Draconic Gifts}中描述的超自然天赋以及{@book piety benefits|MOT|2|Benefits of Piety}中详述的{@book Mythic Odysseys of Theros|MOT}中获取灵感。",
	"Even if you don't elevate dragons to the status of gods in your campaign, these creatures might still have a mythic role to play in the world, granting them a supernatural significance. Consider these examples:": "即使你不把龙提升到你的活动中的神的地位，这些生物仍然可能在这个世界上扮演一个神话般的角色，赋予它们超自然的意义。考虑一下这些例子。",
	"When an artifact called the Rod of Law was shattered into seven parts during the Battle of Pesh, seven ancient metallic dragons were assigned to be the guardians of its fragments. Even sundered, this mighty artifact was so powerful that great cities sprang up near the dragon lairs that house the fragments, forming the centers of civilization. The dragons are patrons of the seven cities, and their roles as guardians of the artifact are all but forgotten.": "在佩什战役中，一件名为 \"法律之杖 \"的神器被打碎成七部分，七条古老的金属龙被指派为其碎片的守护者。即使被拆散，这件强大的神器也是如此强大，以至于在存放碎片的龙巢附近出现了巨大的城市，形成了文明的中心。龙是这七个城市的守护者，而它们作为神器守护者的角色却被遗忘了。",
	"At the dawn of creation, the gods of this world slew another divine being—perhaps their tyrannical parent or one of their kin who betrayed them. They cut this being's body into five pieces, each of which was fed to a different chromatic dragon who gained immortality as a result. Now a cult is plotting to kill these five dragons, cut them open to retrieve the pieces of the devoured god's body, and return the god to life.": "在创世之初，这个世界的诸神杀死了另一个神圣的生命--也许是他们暴虐的父母或背叛他们的一个亲属。他们把这个人的身体切成五块，每一块都被喂给了不同的色龙，色龙因此获得了不朽的生命。现在，一个邪教组织正在密谋杀死这五条龙，把它们切开，取回被吞噬的神的身体碎片，并让神恢复生命。",
	"In the earliest days of creation, fifteen dragons burrowed deep into the earth and went to sleep. Over the eons, elaborate underground dungeons have formed above and around them, becoming habitats for a wide variety of different monsters and repositories for vast treasures. Adventurers on this world are defined by their willingness to brave at least the upper levels of these dungeons, but no one has ever penetrated all the way to the depths where the sleeping dragons still lie.": "在创世之初，十五条龙钻入大地深处，进入了梦乡。经过漫长的岁月，在它们的上方和周围形成了精心设计的地下城，成为各种不同怪物的栖息地和巨大宝藏的储藏室。这个世界上的冒险家们被定义为至少愿意勇敢地进入这些地牢的上层，但从来没有人一直深入到睡龙仍然躺着的深处。",
	"Five ancient metallic dragons (one of each kind) make their lairs in the Pillars of Creation. If all these dragons are killed, the world will literally collapse into chaos.": "五条古老的金属龙（每一种都有）在创世之柱中筑巢。如果这些龙都被杀死，世界将真正地崩溃，陷入混乱。",
	"When the greatest spiritual leaders of the world reach the end of their lives, each is laid to rest on a funeral pyre and reborn out of the ashes as a dragon egg. Temples and monasteries across the world house collections of eggs representing all their past leaders, though most people doubt they will ever hatch. So what happens when cracks begin to appear in the oldest eggs?": "当世界上最伟大的精神领袖走到他们生命的尽头时，每个人都被安放在葬礼的火堆上，并从灰烬中重生为一颗龙蛋。世界各地的寺庙和修道院都收藏着代表他们所有过去领导人的龙蛋，尽管大多数人怀疑它们会孵化。那么，当最古老的龙蛋开始出现裂缝时会发生什么呢？",
	"Dragons are deeply connected to the worlds in which they dwell. The magic of the Material Plane flows through them. It empowers their breath weapons and their tremendous might; it pools in their lairs and tangles in the treasures of their hoards. This chapter, intended for the Dungeon Master, explores the connection between dragons and the world they inhabit and how that connection manifests in each dragon's lair and hoard.": "龙与它们所居住的世界有着深厚的联系。物质世界的魔法在他们身上流动。它赋予了它们的呼吸武器和巨大的力量；它在它们的巢穴中汇集，在它们的宝藏中纠缠。这一章是为地下城管理员准备的，探讨了龙与它们所居住的世界之间的联系，以及这种联系在每个龙的巢穴和囤积物中的表现。",
	"{@book \"Dragon Lairs\"|FTD|4|Dragon Lairs} discusses how the magic that suffuses dragons spills out into the world around the locations these creatures call home. This section includes suggestions for the kinds of locales where dragons like to build their lairs, as well as additional regional effects that might manifest around a lair. Additional lair actions round out this section.": "{@book \"Dragon Lairs\"|FTD|4|Dragon Lairs}讨论了充斥在龙身上的魔法是如何扩散到这些生物称之为家的地方周围的世界中的。这一部分包括对龙喜欢建造巢穴的地点的建议，以及巢穴周围可能出现的额外区域效应。其他的巢穴行动使本节更完善。",
	"{@book \"Dragon Hoards\"|FTD|4|Dragon Hoards} explores the relationship between the size of a dragon's hoard and the dragon's magical might. This section discusses dragons' practice of dividing their hoards into multiple caches that extend their magical reach, and the items that can link those caches together. It also explores the magical quirks—including hauntings and curses—that can arise as enormous amounts of magical power are pooled in one place.": "{@book \"Dragon Hoards\"|FTD|4|Dragon Hoards}探讨了龙的囤积物的大小与龙的魔力之间的关系。本节讨论了龙将其囤积物分为多个藏匿处以扩大其魔法范围的做法，以及可以将这些藏匿处连接在一起的物品。它还探讨了魔法的怪异之处--包括闹鬼和诅咒--当大量的魔法力量集中在一个地方时可能会出现。",
	"{@book \"What's in a Hoard?\"|FTD|4|What's in a Hoard?} provides tables to determine the contents of a dragon's hoard, expanding on the treasure tables in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}.": "{@book \"What's in a Hoard?\"|FTD|4|What's in a Hoard?}提供了确定龙的囤积物的表格，对{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的宝藏表格进行了扩展。",
	"Home is where the hoard is.": "家是囤积物的地方。",
	"A lair is not merely a den where a dragon happens to sleep. It's a nexus for all the magical energy bound up in a dragon. A dragon's lair is a {@i home} and carries all the emotional and magical resonance of that word. It's a sanctum and the repository of the dragon's hoard. It's a place of power, with echoes of its own across multiple worlds.": "巢穴不仅仅是龙睡觉的地方。它是所有束缚在龙身上的魔法能量的纽带。龙的巢穴是一个{@i home}，带有这个词的所有情感和魔法共鸣。它是一个圣地，是龙的囤积物的存放处。它是一个充满力量的地方，在多个世界都有自己的回声。",
	"Consciously or not, young dragons establishing lairs for the first time often seek to establish them in sites of magical resonance. A dragon might look for a place where multiple ley lines of flowing magical energy intersect, a site where a meteorite crashed to earth or a strange mystical crystal lies buried underground, or a place where long-forgotten wizards of an ancient magocratic empire saturated the land with their powerful spells. As a result, a dragon's lair is typically not the only unusual and magically powerful feature in its region. You can use the Lair Location table for inspiration when placing a dragon's lair in or near such a feature.": "不管有没有意识到，年轻的龙在第一次建立巢穴时，往往会寻求在有魔法共鸣的地方建立巢穴。龙可能会寻找一个有多条流动魔法能量的雷电线相交的地方，一个陨石坠落在地球上的地方，或者一个埋藏在地下的奇怪的神秘水晶，或者一个被遗忘已久的古代魔法帝国的巫师用他们强大的法术使土地饱和的地方。因此，龙的巢穴通常不是其所在地区唯一不寻常的、具有强大魔法的特征。在将龙的巢穴放置在这样的地方或附近时，你可以使用巢穴位置表来获得灵感。",
	"The area is a climate anomaly—a cool and lush oasis in a hot desert, a balmy spring within a frozen tundra, a drifting iceberg in a warm sea, a barren waste in the midst of a verdant forest, or the like.": "该地区气候反常--炎热沙漠中的凉爽绿洲，冰冻苔原中的温暖泉水，温暖海洋中的漂流冰山，葱郁森林中的不毛之地，或类似的情况。",
	"Natural rock formations align with celestial phenomena at particular times of the year. Stars and planets might line up with rock spires and windows on solstices and equinoxes, for example.": "在一年中的特定时间，天然岩石构造与天体现象相一致。例如，星星和行星可能会在至点和分点与岩石尖顶和窗户排列在一起。",

	"Ordinarily, a dragon gains access to lair actions and manifests regional effects around a lair only upon reaching adulthood and the legendary status that comes with that age. The close connections between a dragon and the fabric of the Material Plane take time to develop, so the dragon's power doesn't manifest in the world until the dragon has spent nearly a century in a lair. That said, if you want to give lair actions and regional effects to a young dragon or even a wyrmling, you can.": "通常情况下，龙只有在达到成年并具有传奇地位时，才会获得巢穴行动的权限，并在巢穴周围表现出区域效应。龙和物质世界的结构之间的密切联系需要时间来发展，所以龙的力量要到龙在巢穴中度过近一个世纪后才会在世界中显现出来。也就是说，如果你想给年轻的龙甚至是巫妖的巢穴行动和区域效果，你可以。",
	"Lair actions can have a more significant effect on a younger dragon's challenge rating. For adult or ancient dragons, who already benefit from legendary actions, lair actions don't significantly impact their power or how they function in play, but if you add lair actions to a dragon who doesn't already have legendary actions, those actions significantly change the way the dragon plays and probably adjust their challenge rating upward by 1 or more. Use the guidelines on {@book creating monsters|DMG|9|Creating a Monster} in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to determine whether you're making the dragon too much of a threat to a party.": "巢穴行动会对年轻龙的挑战等级产生更重要的影响。对于已经受益于传奇行动的成年龙或远古龙来说，巢穴行动不会对它们的力量或它们在游戏中的作用产生重大影响，但如果你为还没有传奇行动的龙增加巢穴行动，这些行动会大大改变龙的游戏方式，并可能将其挑战等级向上调整1或更多。使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中关于{@book creating monsters|DMG|9|Creating a Monster}的准则来确定你是否使龙对一方的威胁太大。",
	"What is a dragon without a hoard? The answer, it turns out, is \"significantly diminished.\"": "没有囤积物的龙是什么？答案是，\"大大减少\"。",
	"Hoarding treasure is an essential part of draconic nature. It's not that dragons are overwhelmingly greedy, as other peoples understand the term—though some dragons definitely are. Nor are they simply attracted to shiny objects in the manner of magpies. Rather, hoards are extensions of dragons' inherently magical nature—resonators that focus their magic and link them to the magic of the Material Plane.": "囤积财宝是龙族天性中的一个重要部分。这并不是说龙就像其他民族所理解的那样贪得无厌--尽管有些龙肯定是这样。它们也不像喜鹊那样被闪亮的物体所吸引。相反，囤积物是龙固有的魔法性质的延伸--集中它们的魔法并将它们与物质世界的魔法联系起来的谐振器。",
	"Dragons thrum with the magical energy that suffuses the Material Plane, and this energy is amplified by their possession of material things. In practical terms, this means dragons' power is related to both age and the size of their hoards in ways that clever dragons—and would-be dragonslayers—can exploit.": "龙的魔法能量充斥着物质世界，而这种能量会因为它们对物质的占有而放大。在实践中，这意味着龙的力量与年龄和它们的囤积物的大小有关，聪明的龙和可能的屠龙者可以利用这一点。",
	"Wyrmling dragons begin acquiring hoards as soon as they can fly, but their small scope of operations makes them unlikely to amass more than a few hundred gold pieces worth of treasure and perhaps a handful of magic items. If sharing a lair with other wyrmlings or adult dragons, the wyrmlings stash their hoards in their own distinct portions of the lair. Otherwise, they keep their treasure in secret caches near where they sleep.": "巫妖龙一会飞就开始获得囤积物，但它们的活动范围小，不可能积累超过价值几百金币的宝物，也许还有少量的魔法物品。如果与其他巫妖或成年龙共用一个巢穴，巫妖会将他们的囤积物藏在巢穴中各自不同的部分。否则，他们会把财宝放在他们睡觉的地方附近的秘密储藏室里。",
	"As dragons transition from wyrmling to young age, at around five years, they also begin to look for their first permanent lairs and amass more substantial hoards, which grow in value to many thousands of gold pieces. Young dragons keep their hoards safe in the same central location where they sleep. Such dragons typically do not yet impose regional effects, but these effects might begin to manifest as the dragons' connections to their lairs develop. You can add regional effects and even lair actions to young dragons, particularly for dragons who have acquired an unusually large hoard. These dragons might not be old enough to fully step into the power of an adult, but gathering such a hoard makes them more powerful than other dragons of a similar age.": "当龙从巫妖过渡到年轻时，大约五岁时，它们也开始寻找它们的第一个永久巢穴，并积累更多的囤积物，其价值增长到数千枚金币。年轻的龙将它们的囤积物安全地保存在它们睡觉的同一中心位置。这样的龙通常还不会施加区域效应，但随着龙与巢穴的联系发展，这些效应可能会开始显现出来。你可以为年轻的龙添加区域效应，甚至是巢穴行动，尤其是对于那些获得了异常庞大囤积物的龙。这些龙可能还没有老到可以完全步入成人的力量，但收集这样的囤积物使它们比其他类似年龄的龙更强大。",
	"A dragon's transition to adulthood is measured by two milestones: a century of life and a hoard worth around 15,000 gp or more. A hoard of that size binds dragon, lair, and territory together in a tangle of magical energy that makes the dragon truly legendary, empowering the dragon's legendary actions and lair actions and spreading draconic influence throughout the area as regional effects.": "一条龙向成年的过渡是由两个里程碑来衡量的：一个世纪的生命和一个价值约15,000金币或更多的囤积物。如此规模的囤积物将龙、巢穴和领地捆绑在一起，使龙成为真正的传奇，赋予龙的传奇行动和巢穴行动以力量，并将龙族的影响作为区域效应扩散到整个地区。",
	"As dragons age and amass larger hoards, they tend to establish multiple lairs. This serves partly to mitigate risk—there's less chance of a dragon losing an entire hoard in a single burglary if that hoard is spread across multiple locations—and partly to extend the dragon's magical influence across a growing territory. The treasure cache stored in each lair anchors the dragon's power there even when the dragon isn't present, extending the reach of regional effects.": "随着龙的年龄增长，积累了更多的囤积物，它们往往会建立多个巢穴。这一方面是为了降低风险--如果龙的囤积物分散在多个地点，那么它在一次盗窃中丢失整个囤积物的可能性就会降低，另一方面是为了将龙的魔法影响力扩展到不断扩大的领土上。储存在每个巢穴中的宝藏将龙的力量固定在那里，即使龙不在那里，也能扩大区域效应的范围。",
	"Dragons typically establish new caches as their hoard reaches multiples of 15,000 gp. Throughout their adult years, dragons can each assemble six to eight caches in multiple lairs spread across the greater part of a continent.": "当龙的囤积物达到15,000金币的倍数时，它们通常会建立新的藏匿处。在整个成年时期，龙可以在分布在一个大陆大部分地区的多个巢穴中收集六到八个藏匿点。",
	"Around the age of eight hundred years, dragons take on ancient status, by which time they have typically amassed eight to ten caches whose total value is at least 200,000 gp. Ancient dragons continue expanding their hoards as the centuries wear on, increasing both the number of caches and the value of each cache, until their total wealth can exceed a million gold pieces.": "大约在八百岁左右，龙就具有了古代人的身份，这时他们通常已经积累了八到十个藏品，其总价值至少为200,000金币。随着时间的推移，古龙继续扩大他们的藏品，增加藏品的数量和每个藏品的价值，直到他们的总财富可以超过一百万金币。",
	"A dragon dividing a hoard often apportions one or more pieces from a linked set of objects to each treasure cache. This practice strengthens the mystical link among the portions of the divided hoard, helping to maintain the dragon's claim of ownership over the parts of the hoard far from the dragon's current location and unifying scattered caches into what is effectively a single hoard.": "分割宝藏的龙通常会从一组有联系的物品中分配出一件或多件到每个藏宝处。这种做法加强了被分割的宝藏中各部分之间的神秘联系，有助于维持龙对远离龙当前位置的宝藏部分的所有权要求，并将分散的宝藏统一为一个有效的宝藏。",
	"This linking can add the fun goal of having the characters collect a complete set of divided treasure as they try to find all the caches of a dragon's hoard. The Hoard Linking Items table offers suggestions for item sets that a dragon might use in this way. Ideally, players should be able to deduce the total number of items in the set after they've found one or two caches, so they know how many more pieces need to be collected. Sometimes the correct number is obvious (the number of pieces in a chess set or cards in a deck, for example), but consider having an item found early on be stored in a decorative box whose empty spaces indicate the number of pieces missing.": "这种链接可以增加一个有趣的目标，即让角色在试图找到龙的囤积物的所有藏匿处时，收集一套完整的分割的宝物。囤积物链接表为龙可能以这种方式使用的物品集提供了建议。理想情况下，玩家在找到一个或两个藏宝处后，应该能够推断出这套物品的总数，这样他们就知道还有多少件需要收集。有时，正确的数字是显而易见的（例如，国际象棋中的棋子数或一副牌中的牌数），但可以考虑将早期发现的物品存放在一个装饰盒中，盒中的空位表示所缺的棋子数。",

	"Because dragons' power is linked to treasure, it's possible to weaken a dragon by plundering the dragon's lair. By gaining access to a hoard and making off with a significant portion of that wealth, characters can diminish the dragon's connection to both that lair and its associated territory.": "因为龙的力量与财宝有关，所以有可能通过掠夺龙的巢穴来削弱龙的力量。通过获得囤积的财物并带走其中的大部分，角色可以削弱龙与巢穴及其相关领土的联系。",
	"As a rule of thumb, if a dragon's lair no longer holds at least 10,000 gp worth of treasure, the site is no longer considered a lair. The dragon can't use lair actions there, and the regional effects surrounding the lair end or fade as if the dragon had died.": "根据经验，如果龙的巢穴不再拥有价值至少10,000金币的宝物，那么这个地方就不再被视为巢穴。龙不能在那里使用巢穴行动，巢穴周围的区域效应也会结束或消退，就像龙已经死亡一样。",
	"This suggests an effective strategy that characters might hit on for confronting a dragon: find one of the dragon's smaller lairs and plunder the treasure there, removing it quickly. Disturbing a hoard inevitably attracts the dragon's attention, because either minions or the dragon's magical connection to the hoard alerts the dragon to intruders. A dragon coming to investigate the disturbed lair has a strong incentive to fight in reaction to the theft—and to prevent the loss of more treasure. The realization might come too late that the loss of treasure has left the dragon vulnerable.": "这表明人物在面对龙时可能会采取有效的策略：找到龙的一个小巢穴，掠夺那里的财宝，并迅速将其取出。扰乱宝藏不可避免地会引起龙的注意，因为无论是爪牙还是龙与宝藏的魔法联系都会提醒龙注意入侵者。前来调查被扰乱的巢穴的龙有强烈的动机对盗窃行为作出反应，并防止损失更多的财宝。意识到这一点可能为时已晚，因为财宝的损失已经使龙变得脆弱。",
	"Theoretically, it's possible to strip an adult or ancient dragon of legendary status by plundering the dragon's entire hoard across all its locations. For this to work, the dragon would have to be magically bound or otherwise prevented from interfering with the looting—but that sort of binding might be easier than killing a powerful legendary dragon.": "理论上说，通过掠夺一条成年龙或古龙在其所有地点的全部囤积物，有可能剥夺其传奇地位。要做到这一点，必须用魔法束缚住龙，或以其他方式阻止它干扰掠夺，但这种束缚可能比杀死一只强大的传奇龙更容易。",
	"A dragon's hoard has features similar to those of a powerful magic object, and plundering a hoard can have lingering effects long after the death of its draconic owner. Any number of supernatural effects can linger in and around the hoard of a legendary dragon, often concentrated in a few valuable pieces of treasure—the most precious gems or art objects, or the rarest magic items, for example.": "龙的囤积物有类似于强大的魔法物品的特征，掠夺一个囤积物可以在其龙族主人死后很长时间内产生挥之不去的影响。任何数量的超自然效果都可以在传奇龙的囤积物中和周围徘徊，通常集中在几件有价值的宝物上--例如最珍贵的宝石或艺术品，或最稀有的魔法物品等。",
	"The regional effects associated with legendary dragons' lairs are channeled into the environment from the dragons through their hoards. These effects can linger to varying degrees when a hoard's treasure is moved somewhere else, as in any of the following examples:": "与传说中的龙穴相关的区域效应是通过龙的囤积物从龙那里传入环境的。当囤积的财宝被转移到其他地方时，这些影响会在不同程度上徘徊，如以下任何一个例子。",

This property of the lair vanishes after {@dice 1d10} days if the dragon dies.": "两个烟囱将主洞与上面的三个房间连接起来。每个烟囱看起来都是通过上层的天花板继续向上，通过下层的地板向下，但龙的魔法使巢穴内的空间扭曲。从上层往上走会使生物再次进入下层，而从下层往下走会使生物进入上层。一个生物或物体从其中一个烟囱掉下来，就会无休止地坠落，除非它或某种外部力量有办法减缓或阻止它。如果龙死了，巢穴的这个属性会在{@dice 1d10}天后消失。",
	"The dragon most often sleeps in the largest upper chamber of the lair. The dragon's hoard is divided between that area and the chamber at the opposite end of the upper level.

	"Amethyst dragons favor treasures with particular scholarly or philosophical value as a part of their hoard, including fine books, scrolls, or carved tablets; tapestries or woven \"tomes\" of embroidered cloth; complex scientific instruments; and religious icons or objects. They are fond of unique and unusual art objects, especially those connected to far-off or long-lost cultures, other planes of existence, or other worlds—and of magic items that allow movement between those planes or worlds. The odd spatial nature of an amethyst dragon's lair can sometimes cause items to transpose between one dragon's hoard and the hoards of the dragon's echoes, allowing for treasures with a surprising range of origins.": "紫晶龙喜欢具有特殊学术或哲学价值的宝物作为他们囤积的一部分，包括精美的书籍、卷轴或雕刻的石板；挂毯或绣花布编织的 \"书册\"；复杂的科学仪器；以及宗教图标或物品。他们喜欢独特和不寻常的艺术品，特别是那些与遥远或久违的文化、其他生存空间或其他世界有关的艺术品，以及允许在这些空间或世界之间移动的魔法物品。紫晶龙巢穴的奇特空间性质有时会导致物品在一条龙的囤积物和龙的回声的囤积物之间转换，从而使宝物的来源有了惊人的变化。",

The sand covering the floor of the chamber sometimes ripples or swirls ominously, perhaps in response to unpredictable desert winds, the dragon's magic, or some creature lurking beneath the sand.": "一个开放的中央洞窟是巢穴的主要入口。玻璃墙升至30英尺高，与雕刻的石柱和古城的部分墙壁相融合。一块狭窄的、锯齿状的花岗岩从室顶附近的墙上水平伸出，提供了一个栖息地，龙可以从那里观察洞穴。覆盖在密室地板上的沙子有时会泛起涟漪或不祥的漩涡，这也许是对不可预测的沙漠风、龙的魔法或潜伏在沙子下面的某些生物的反应。",

It features a bejeweled and cushioned dais on which the dragon often reclines.": "龙睡在地图右下方的一个大房间里。这个巢穴是古城中保存完好的遗迹；这个优雅的空间挂着蓝色和紫色的丝绸窗帘，其加工过的石头地板上铺着互补色调的毛绒花纹地毯。它有一个镶有宝石和垫子的台子，龙经常躺在上面。",

	"The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A 5-foot-radius, 20-foot-deep pit forms centered on that point.

	"Blue dragons have strict standards for what treasures they allow into their hoards and reject valuable objects that don't meet those standards.

At the same time, bronze dragons understand that they are their own best defense in a siege, so they are careful to maximize their mobility with multiple ways in and out of their lairs.": "当谈到巢穴时，青铜龙重视功能而非形式，他们以军事指挥官的眼光研究潜在的防御地点。他们欣赏悬崖边的洞穴或石头堡垒的坚固性，经常用巧妙的陷阱和壁垒加强现有的防御。同时，青铜龙明白，在围攻中他们是自己最好的防御，所以他们小心翼翼地通过多种方式进出巢穴，最大限度地提高自己的流动性。",

During the Vingaard Campaign, Fireflash teamed up with a dwarf named Flint Fireforge and a kender named Tasslehoff Burrfoot to capture Highmaster Bakaris. Later, in the Blue Lady's War, Tasslehoff foresaw Fireflash's demise at the hands of the death knight Lord Soth—and was thus able to avert the dragon's grim fate.": "火焰也被称为Khirsah，是一只热情好客、好奇心强的青铜龙，对其他物种有着浓厚的兴趣，尤其是矮人和精灵。在长枪战争期间，他是最早响应希尔瓦拉的号召的人之一--银龙德安特的精灵身份，要求金属龙加入冲突。在文加德战役中，火焰与一个叫弗林特-火炉的矮人和一个叫塔斯勒霍夫-伯尔福特的坎德人合作，抓获了巴卡利斯高级主管。后来，在蓝女士战争中，塔斯勒霍夫预见到了火焰在死亡骑士索斯勋爵手中的灭亡--因此能够避免龙的悲惨命运。",

	"A bronze dragon's hoard is a history of the dragon's deeds, with trophies from fallen foes and payment from grateful petitioners resting alongside more mundane spoils of war and loot salvaged from shipwrecks and the seabed.

Their hoards teem with weapons, armor, and magic items built for the battlefield—the more unique, the better.

They love collecting and studying histories that can give them tactical insight or inspiration, as well as safeguarding artifacts they deem too dangerous to entrust to anyone else.": "青铜龙对他们作为正义守护者的角色有一种浪漫的看法，他们更喜欢与他们的英雄叙事相关的宝物。他们的囤积物中充满了武器、盔甲和为战场准备的魔法物品--越独特越好。对青铜龙来说，故事很重要，他们宁愿拥有击倒暴君的简陋长矛，也不愿拥有从未参加过战斗的宝石刀。他们喜欢收集和研究能够给他们带来战术洞察力或灵感的历史，以及保护他们认为太危险而不能委托给其他人的文物。",

Others are built upon the ruins of ancient cities or carved into caves near underground lakes.": "深海巨龙在暗黑世界的隐蔽处建造巢穴，通常靠近与它们有联盟或敌意的人的定居点。它们的巢穴是高度个性化的。有些是由活的真菌网络织成的。另一些则建在古城的废墟上，或者刻在地下湖附近的洞穴里。",
	"Deep dragons' lairs serve as bases for the dragons' explorations, as well as providing safe storage for their hoards. When these curious creatures are away from home searching out new environments and seeing new vistas, they usually leave their lairs protected by servitors, allies, magic, traps, or some combination of these protections.": "深海巨龙的巢穴是巨龙探索的基地，同时也为它们的囤积物提供安全的储存。当这些好奇的生物离开家去寻找新的环境和看到新的景象时，他们通常会离开他们的巢穴，由仆人、盟友、魔法、陷阱或这些保护措施的一些组合来保护。",
	"A deep dragon lair might share the same basic structure as the sapphire dragon lair shown on {@book map 5.12|FTD|5|Map 5.12: sapphire dragon lair}, but instead of being formed from stone, it might consist of chambers hollowed out within a fungus network growing near an underground river. Whatever the setup, a deep dragon festoons the narrow, twisting passages between the lair's fungal walls with magical and mundane traps. A typical lair has the following features:": "一个深海龙巢穴可能与{@book map 5.12|FTD|5|Map 5.12: sapphire dragon lair}所示的蓝宝石龙巢穴有相同的基本结构，但它可能不是由石头形成的，而是由生长在地下河附近的真菌网络中挖出的腔室组成。不管是什么设置，深海龙都会在巢穴的真菌墙之间的狭窄、扭曲的通道上布置魔法和世俗的陷阱。一个典型的巢穴有以下特点。",
	"Because a deep dragon lacks a sapphire dragon's ability to shape stone, add a few connecting passages or secret doors to otherwise inaccessible chambers, possibly including connections to the adjacent underground stream as entrances to the lair.": "因为深海龙缺乏蓝宝石龙塑造石头的能力，所以要在其他无法进入的房间里添加一些连接通道或秘密门，可能包括与邻近的地下流的连接，作为巢穴的入口。",

	"Deep dragons adore goods from distant lands, especially if those goods are unique. They hoard mementos of memorable hunts or exploring expeditions.

	"It is rare to find a deep dragon hoard that is simply a pile of gems and treasures, for these creatures take great pride in organizing and displaying their possessions. They can easily spend multiple days guiding visitors from prize to prize, telling stories about favorite keepsakes—and when deep dragons visit each other, these tours can stretch out for days.": "很少发现深海龙的囤积物只是一堆宝石和珍宝，因为这些生物对整理和展示他们的财产感到非常自豪。它们可以轻松地花上好几天时间，引导游客从一个奖品到另一个奖品，讲述关于最喜欢的纪念品的故事--当深海龙互相拜访时，这些旅行可以延长好几天。",

	"Raulothim is an {@creature ancient emerald dragon|FTD} who dwells in an extinct volcano known as the Pit of Stars, on the northernmost isle of Ruathym off the Sword Coast of Faerûn. Though most emerald dragons are paranoid by nature, Raulothim became especially so after having witnessed the arrival of planar travelers in Faerûn. Fearing that an invasion of his world by interplanar armies was inevitable, he has spent the past century collecting magic items that he hopes will enable him to survive the coming conflict.": "Raulothim是一个{@creature ancient emerald dragon|FTD}，居住在法鲁恩剑海岸外Ruathym最北边的一座死火山中，被称为星之坑。虽然大多数绿宝石龙生性多疑，但在目睹了平面旅行者来到法鲁恩之后，劳尔西姆变得特别多疑。由于担心他的世界不可避免地会受到星际军队的入侵，他在过去的一个世纪里一直在收集魔法物品，希望能让他在即将到来的冲突中生存下来。",
	"Raulothim's drive to amass magic and his innate mistrust of anyone powerful enough to potentially threaten him make the dragon a dangerous adversary. However, he knows the surest way of safeguarding Faerûn against planar invaders is to keep a careful watch on all planar portals—and that to do so, he must rely on allies. Raulothim is therefore open to negotiating with adventurers willing to aid in that task—but only those he is sure he can trust. On more than one occasion, doubt has gnawed at Raulothim's mind, prompting him to preemptively strike against a previously trusted ally.": "Raulothim积累魔法的动力，以及他对任何强大到足以威胁到他的人天生的不信任，使这条龙成为一个危险的对手。然而，他知道保护法鲁恩免受星球入侵的最可靠方法是仔细观察所有的星球门户--要做到这一点，他必须依靠盟友。因此，Raulothim愿意与愿意协助完成这项任务的冒险者进行谈判，但只有那些他确信可以信任的人。不止一次，疑虑在Raulothim的脑海中徘徊，促使他先发制人地打击一个先前信任的盟友。",
	"Emerald dragons make their lairs in caves and subterranean ruins, favoring locations that have been abandoned—and ideally forgotten—by other creatures. They are most comfortable in extreme heat, so they frequently choose lair sites in the sides of volcanoes or near geothermal vents.": "翡翠龙在洞穴和地下废墟中筑巢，喜欢那些被其他生物遗弃的地方，最好是被遗忘的地方。它们在极端炎热的环境中最为舒适，因此它们经常选择在火山侧面或地热喷口附近筑巢。",
	"An emerald dragon's lair is a maze of twisting tunnels, interconnected caverns, or crumbling ruins designed to disorient intruders. Circuitous routes within the lair provide the dragon with numerous ways to evade pursuit, while strategically designed choke points allow them to harry enemies with repeated ambushes. Emerald dragons frequently lay traps and alarms at the entrance points to their lairs, with older (and more paranoid) dragons employing several layers of such defenses.": "绿宝石龙的巢穴是一个由扭曲的隧道、相互连接的洞穴或摇摇欲坠的废墟组成的迷宫，旨在迷惑入侵者。巢穴内的迂回路线为龙提供了许多躲避追击的方法，而战略性地设计的阻塞点则使它们可以通过反复的伏击来骚扰敌人。翡翠龙经常在其巢穴的入口处设置陷阱和警报器，年长的（和更多的偏执狂）龙会采用几层这样的防御措施。",
	"The emerald dragon lair shown in map 5.8 is a series of ancient vaults situated beneath a city built in the caldera of a dormant volcano. The vaults fell into disuse over a century ago when an upwelling from the lake at the caldera's center collapsed a portion of the vaults and flooded their halls with boiling water and noxious fumes. The stairwell leading up to the city was sealed to prevent the fumes from spilling into the streets above. Decades later, once the volcano's activity had subsided, the dragon moved in.": "地图5.8中显示的翡翠龙巢穴是一系列古老的地窖，位于一座建在休眠火山口中的城市下面。一个多世纪前，破火山口中心的湖水上涌，使部分拱顶坍塌，沸水和毒气淹没了拱顶大厅，拱顶就被废弃了。通往城市的楼梯被密封，以防止烟雾溢出到上面的街道。几十年后，一旦火山的活动减弱，龙就搬了进来。",
	"When the volcano is quiet, the dragon uses the lava tubes to come and go from the lair.": "当火山安静的时候，龙利用熔岩管道从巢穴中来回穿梭。",
	"The emerald dragon resides in a grand rectangular hall near the center of the vaults, keeping one eye on the hallway leading to the flooded stairwell, never quite trusting that some covetous intruder won't find a way through.": "翡翠龙居住在靠近金库中心的一个巨大的长方形大厅里，一只眼睛盯着通向水浸楼梯间的走廊，从不相信一些觊觎的入侵者不会找到通过的方法。",
	"The dragon stores the finest treasures in a smaller chamber just above the great hall on the map.": "龙把最好的宝物存放在地图上大殿上方的一个小房间里。",
	"Near the bottom portion of the map, the vaults give way to natural stone caves; these caves slope down to a subterranean pool that connects to the caldera lake via an underwater channel. When the volcano is active, the waters here bubble up into the caves before draining down nearby lava tubes. During especially active periods, the waters surge up into the nearest halls and corridors before draining away.": "靠近地图的底部部分，拱顶让位于天然石洞；这些石洞斜向地下水池，通过水下通道与破火山口湖相连。当火山活跃时，这里的水会涌入洞穴，然后顺着附近的熔岩管道流走。在特别活跃的时期，水涌上最近的大厅和走廊，然后再排走。",
	"The dragon stashes gold and gems in an underwater cave (at the bottom of the map), the entrance to which lies 40 feet below the surface of the subterranean pool.": "这条龙把黄金和宝石藏在一个水下洞穴里（在地图的底部），洞穴的入口位于地下水池表面以下40英尺。",
	"The dragon has left most of the remaining areas of the vaults as they were when their creators abandoned them, taking great interest in the artifacts and architecture they left behind. Visitors who manage to convince the dragon they are not a threat are treated to a tour of the vaults, with the dragon acting like the curator of a museum.": "这条龙将金库的大部分剩余区域都保留了它们的创造者抛弃它们时的样子，对它们留下的文物和建筑产生了极大的兴趣。凡是能够说服龙的游客，他们不会受到威胁，就可以在龙的带领下参观地窖，龙就像博物馆的馆长一样。",
	"Emerald dragons are unusual among gem dragons in their preference for coinage over gemstones when amassing treasure. They are fascinated by the various designs of coinage and often strive to collect rare mintages. Most emerald dragons can precisely enumerate the names, amounts, and denominations of every bit of currency in their hoards.": "翡翠龙在宝石龙中是不寻常的，因为他们在积累宝藏时更喜欢钱币而不是宝石。他们对钱币的各种设计非常着迷，并经常努力收集稀有的铸币。大多数绿宝石龙可以精确地列举出他们囤积的每一种货币的名称、数量和面值。",
	"Emerald dragons also prize cultural artifacts, especially relics with historical significance. They place great importance on an item's provenance, which can make it difficult to gauge how they might value any particular object. Despite remaining unmoved by the loss of a gold scepter deemed to be a replica, an emerald dragon might become enraged at the theft of a clay mug known to have been used by a legendary dwarf warlord while on campaign.": "翡翠龙也珍视文化艺术品，特别是具有历史意义的遗物。他们非常重视一件物品的出处，这可能会使人难以衡量他们对任何特定物品的重视程度。尽管对被认为是复制品的黄金权杖的丢失无动于衷，但翡翠龙可能会对一个已知由传奇矮人军阀在战役中使用过的粘土杯被盗感到愤怒。",

	"Faerie dragons go where the fun is. For many, this means dwelling near portals to the Feywild, enjoying that realm's unpredictable magic and boisterous revels. Yet it can just as easily mean residing among other peoples—stealing baubles from shrines, nesting in cluttered attics, or following explorers and other intriguing individuals on their travels. For as much as they love their homes and hoards, faerie dragons abandon both without a second thought if adventure beckons.": "精灵龙到哪里去找乐子。对许多人来说，这意味着居住在通往精灵世界的门户附近，享受那个领域不可预知的魔法和喧闹的狂欢。然而，这也很容易意味着居住在其他人中间--从神龛上偷取小饰品，在杂乱的阁楼上筑巢，或者跟随探险家和其他有趣的人旅行。就像他们喜欢自己的家和囤积物一样，如果有冒险的召唤，精灵龙会毫不犹豫地放弃这两样东西。",
	"Faerie dragon lairs are as varied and eccentric as their owners. Some resemble simple animal nests, hidden away in secret crevices or woven of twigs and trash in the forks of ancient trees. Faerie dragons may also draw on the trappings of civilization, perhaps stealing a child's dollhouse for use as a manor or convincing pixies to construct them a silken bower. The most elaborate faerie dragon lairs are modeled off those of larger dragons, featuring multiple chambers and cunning traps.": "精灵龙的巢穴和它们的主人一样多变而古怪。有些类似于简单的动物巢穴，藏在秘密的缝隙里，或者用树枝和垃圾在古树的分叉处编织。精灵龙也可能利用文明的外衣，也许是偷了一个孩子的娃娃屋作为庄园，或者说服小精灵为他们建造一个丝质花房。最精致的精灵龙巢穴是仿照大型龙的巢穴建造的，有多个房间和狡猾的陷阱。",

	"Sometimes incorrectly assumed to be a god by non-dragons, Nathair Sgiathach (pronounced \"nah-HAIR skee-HOKH\") is the most famous of faerie dragon folk heroes. Like other faerie dragons, Nathair adores jokes—even those made at the dragon's expense—which makes Nathair particularly popular among their pixie, sprite, and other Fey associates. Though Nathair's magical powers are far greater than those of most faerie dragons (thanks in part to highly developed dragonsight), Nathair still prefers to resolve conflict with harmless pranks and absurdities, such as making an enemy's buttocks glow red and appear to sing folk tunes. When necessary, however, Nathair doesn't shy away from fighting to defend their beloved faerie folk. As such, some Fey teach their children to call Nathair Sgiathach's name in times of trouble, on the chance that the faerie dragon might be lurking invisibly nearby, as well as to put out ceremonial offerings of the faerie dragon's favorite food: apple pie.": "有时非龙族会错误地认为他是神，纳泰尔-斯吉塔赫（Nathair Sgiathach）（发音为 \"nah-HAIR skee-HOKH\"）是最著名的法力龙民间英雄。像其他精灵龙一样，纳泰尔喜欢开玩笑--即使是那些以龙为代价的玩笑--这使得纳泰尔在他们的小精灵、精灵和其他费伊族的伙伴中特别受欢迎。虽然纳泰尔的魔力远远超过大多数精灵龙（部分归功于高度发达的龙眼），但纳泰尔仍然喜欢用无害的恶作剧和荒诞的方式来解决冲突，比如让敌人的臀部发红光，出现唱民谣的情况。然而，在必要的时候，Nathair并不回避为捍卫他们心爱的精灵民俗而战斗。因此，一些费伊人教他们的孩子在遇到麻烦的时候呼唤纳泰尔-斯吉塔赫的名字，因为这条精灵龙可能就潜伏在附近，同时也要拿出精灵龙最喜欢的食物来祭祀：苹果馅饼。",

The banyan continues to grow and to swallow up other nearby trees.": "地图5.10中显示的绿龙巢穴是一棵巨大的榕树，曾经是居住在周围的木精灵的圣物。榕树周围原来的宿主树现在已经死了，而且已经腐烂了，在榕树的树干内留下了一个大的柱状轴，龙把它扩展成一个地下巢穴。榕树继续生长，并吞噬附近的其他树木。",
	"The green dragon has teased the banyan's sprawling canopy into a bowl-like shape within which the dragon can comfortably lounge. Threaded through the branches are bones from the dragon's meals—some messily clustered among the leaves, and others deliberately arranged to create macabre dioramas for the dragon's amusement. Such grisly scenes can also be seen scattered throughout the lair as reminders of the dragon's power, and as distractions and warnings for would-be interlopers.": "这条绿龙把榕树的树冠挑逗成一个碗状，让龙可以舒适地在里面休息。树枝上穿插着龙的食物的骨头--有些乱七八糟地集中在树叶中，有些则故意排列成可怕的西洋镜，供龙取乐。这种可怕的场景也可以在整个巢穴中看到，作为对龙的力量的提醒，以及对可能的入侵者的分散注意力和警告。",
	"The hollow center of the tree gives access to the dragon's lair below, nestled among the banyan's sprawling roots. Three tunnels branch off from the vertical shaft at different levels—none of them at the very bottom. This means a creature that falls to the bottom must find a way to ascend at least as far as the lowest tunnel.": "树的中心是空心的，可以通往下面的龙穴，它依偎在榕树蔓延的根部。三条隧道在不同的层面上从竖井中分支出来--其中没有一条在最底层。这意味着落到底部的生物必须找到一种方法，至少要上升到最低的隧道。",

	"The dragon can cause any Tiny Beast within 1 mile of its lair to act as its mouthpiece. The effect is horrendous, as the creature's throat and mouth temporarily warp into a twisted version of the dragon's own in order to allow the dragon's voice to issue forth.": "龙可以使其巢穴周围1英里内的任何小兽充当它的喉舌。其效果是可怕的，因为该生物的喉咙和嘴巴会暂时扭曲成龙的扭曲版本，以便让龙的声音发出来。",
	"Green dragons relish gems and jewelry whose palettes reflect their chosen forest environments, favoring viridescent colors and bursts of floral brilliance. Many develop vast collections of emeralds and beryls as a result, punctuated by amber, red rubies, tiger's eyes, bismuth, and the like. They likewise covet finely crafted items and works of art depicting unspoiled nature.": "绿龙喜欢宝石和珠宝，它们的调色板反映了它们所选择的森林环境，偏向于病毒性的颜色和花色的光彩的爆发。许多人因此而发展出大量的祖母绿和绿宝石收藏，并以琥珀、红宝石、虎眼石、铋等作为点缀。他们也同样垂涎于描绘未受破坏的大自然的精巧物品和艺术作品。",
	"Unlike many of their kin, green dragons use the transformative power of nature to turn those valuables into truly unique treasures. By wrapping and threading treasures with rare vegetation and carefully applying their own skill as gardeners, green dragons meld nature and artifice into new masterpieces. This can lead to complications for would-be treasure hunters, as green dragons take enormous pride in their handiwork—so much so that intruders damaging the delicate arrangements of flower and vine that surround a treasure cache might come under attack before even touching any of the hoard's contents.": "与许多同类不同的是，绿龙利用大自然的转化能力，将这些贵重物品变成真正独特的宝物。通过用稀有植被包裹和穿插宝物，并小心翼翼地运用他们自己作为园丁的技能，绿龙将自然和人工融合成新的杰作。这可能会给潜在的寻宝者带来麻烦，因为绿龙对自己的手艺感到非常自豪--以至于入侵者破坏了围绕藏宝处的精致的花和藤蔓安排，可能在接触到任何囤积的东西之前就会受到攻击。",

	"Often, a moonstone dragon's lair is not a single location, but rather a collection of personally significant places spread out across multiple planes of existence and connected through portals under the dragon's control. A lair might include a secluded grove on the Material Plane, a well-protected tower in the Feywild, and even a hidden corner of the Ethereal Plane. Moonstone dragons often use locations in the Feywild as their primary residences, locations on the Material Plane for entertaining guests, and locations on the Ethereal Plane for storage.

	"When dragons become aware of the Shadowfell's malign influence seeping into their territories, most scoop up their hoards and abandon any compromised lairs. But some are stubborn, prideful, or bitter enough to stay, even in the face of inevitable corruption. More often, a dragon is unknowingly swept up by the Shadowfell while asleep, awakening after a years-long rest to find that both dragon and lair have changed. In these cases, a shadow dragon's lair undergoes the same transformation as the dragon, becoming a shadowy, melancholic version of the original site.": "当龙意识到影子城的恶性影响渗入他们的领地时，大多数龙会把它们的囤积物舀出来，放弃任何妥协的巢穴。但是有些龙很顽固，很骄傲，或者很痛苦，甚至在面对不可避免的腐败时也要留下来。更常见的情况是，一条龙在沉睡中不知不觉地被影子城卷走，在长达数年的休息后醒来，发现龙和巢穴都已改变。在这种情况下，影子龙的巢穴会经历与龙相同的转变，成为原址的阴暗、忧郁的版本。",
	"Shadow dragons that are born on the Shadowfell or seek out new lairs after their transformations establish lairs according to the preferences of their kind, though they find comfort only in the most gloomy and cheerless of places. Reconciling these sometimes-contrasting urges can lead to some very unusual lair choices.": "在暗影城出生的影龙或在变身后寻找新的巢穴的影龙会根据它们的喜好建立巢穴，尽管它们只在最阴暗和不愉快的地方找到安慰。调和这些有时截然不同的冲动会导致一些非常不寻常的巢穴选择。",
	"As an example, consider the red dragon lair in {@book map 5.11|FTD|5|Map 5.11: red dragon lair} as the lair of a red shadow dragon. In this case, the once-active volcano has now lapsed into dormancy. Its lava flows have cooled into a blackened, alien landscape. Ash coats the slopes of the caldera, picked up by the weird swirling winds common to this region and drawn into the atmosphere. Clouds of ash periodically cast the surrounding lands into deep shadow, before the fine grit once again falls to the ground in a hazy gray blizzard. The shadow dragon prowls the region during these hazes, rendered all but invisible by the eddies of ash.": "举个例子，把{@book map 5.11|FTD|5|Map 5.11: red dragon lair}的红龙巢穴视为红影龙的巢穴。在这种情况下，曾经活跃的火山现在已经陷入了休眠状态。它的熔岩流已经冷却，变成了黑色的异样景观。灰烬覆盖在火山口的斜坡上，被这个地区常见的奇怪的漩涡风吹起，并被卷入大气层。灰云周期性地将周围的土地笼罩在深深的阴影中，然后细小的砂砾再次落在地面上，形成朦胧的灰色暴风雪。影子龙在这些雾霾中游荡，被灰烬的漩涡弄得几乎看不见了。",
	"In the heart of the lair, even the brightest light is muted, and creatures find their eyes playing tricks on them as details and distance are distorted. The shadow dragon rarely leaves this place except to hunt and is attended by dozens of shadows.": "在巢穴的中心，即使是最明亮的光线也被削弱了，生物发现他们的眼睛在玩弄他们，因为细节和距离被扭曲了。除了打猎，影龙很少离开这个地方，而且有几十个影子跟随。",
	"Shadow dragons have access to the lair actions usable by untransformed dragons of the same kind. The effects of these actions might be cosmetically altered, seeming darker, gloomier, and more subdued. They might also deal necrotic damage instead of other damage types. At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) shadow dragon can use the following additional lair action while in its lair:": "影子龙可以使用未转化的同类龙所能使用的巢穴行动。这些行动的效果可能在外观上有所改变，看起来更黑暗、更阴郁、更低调。它们也可能造成坏死的伤害，而不是其他类型的伤害。根据你的判断，传奇（成年或古代）影龙在其巢穴中可以使用以下额外的巢穴行动。",
	"Any nonmagical source of illumination within a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon is snuffed out, and any spell that creates light within that same area is dispelled.": "在以龙为中心的60英尺半径范围内的任何非魔法照明源都会被扼杀，而在同一区域内任何创造光的法术都会被驱散。",
	"When a shadow dragon establishes a lair on the Material Plane, the region around the lair takes on some of the characteristics of the Shadowfell, creating one or more of the following effects:": "当影龙在物质界建立巢穴时，巢穴周围的区域会呈现出影子城的某些特性，产生以下一种或多种效果。",

	"Shadow dragons retain the preferences of their original form when it comes to treasure. With each passing year, though, the more lustrous objects in their hoards begin to instill a sort of revulsion in the shadow dragons, much as sunlight does. Gleaming coins and shiny baubles sicken and anger them, and they blunt and tarnish these items to make them easier to look on. Ebony, onyx, and similar dark-hued valuables bring shadow dragons no particular joy, but they aren't as inherently repellent as silver, platinum, and diamonds.": "当涉及到财宝时，影子龙保留了其原始形态的偏好。不过，随着时间的推移，他们的囤积物中更有光泽的物品开始让影龙产生一种反感，就像阳光一样。金光闪闪的硬币和闪亮的小玩意让他们感到恶心和愤怒，他们把这些东西弄得很钝，使它们更容易被人看到。黑檀木、玛瑙和类似的深色贵重物品并没有给影龙带来特别的快乐，但它们并不像银、铂金和钻石那样具有内在的排斥性。",
	"Beauty fills shadow dragons with contempt, and that is true of the treasures they collect as well. Though they cannot abandon their hoards, shadow dragons hide them away even from their own sight. The most resplendent items are always the best hidden, and a shadow dragon's lair contains a great many secret caches. An ancient shadow dragon might have a hundred or more such repositories secreted about their territory, making stealing from a shadow dragon both difficult and dangerous.": "美貌让影龙充满了蔑视，他们收集的宝物也是如此。虽然他们不能放弃他们的囤积物，但影龙甚至在他们自己的视线范围内将它们隐藏起来。最耀眼的物品总是隐藏得最好的，而影龙的巢穴里有许多秘密的藏品。一条古老的影龙可能有一百个或更多这样的储藏室，隐藏在他们的领土上，使得从影龙那里偷窃既困难又危险。",

	"More than anything else, silver dragons covet mementos from the people they interact with. Whether these are sentimental gifts worthless to anyone except their recipient or medals from a grateful monarch, silver dragons want them all.

Failing that, her plan is to continue to amass treasure during her winter raids until she is powerful enough to break her bonds completely.": "瑞梅过去的经历使她对所有的人形生物产生了怀疑，她经常在没有挑衅的情况下向他们发泄怒火。然而，她忍受着那些在她的巢穴里居住的邪教徒的存在，因为他们在她无法狩猎的漫长月份里给她带来了食物。瑞梅也在寻找一种方法来摆脱她的米特拉尔枷锁，并会谨慎地与可能帮助她的施法者进行交谈。如果失败了，她的计划是在冬季的突袭中继续积累财宝，直到她强大到可以完全打破她的束缚。",
	"The greater part of a white dragon's hoard consists of trophies taken from defeated foes.

	"The most comprehensive histories suggest Toril (the world of the Forgotten Realms setting) has not always known dragons, at least not in their current forms.

Certainly, the dragons of Toril cleave closely to the draconic archetypes described in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, and although Bahamut and Tiamat have sometimes been known by other names on that world (such as Xymor and Tchazzar), they have always had a part to play in the world's divine drama.": "最全面的历史记录表明托瑞尔（被遗忘国度设定的世界）并非总是有龙存在，至少不是以它们当前的形态。许多学者推测托瑞尔的龙是从某种爬行动物的祖先进化而来的。尽管有可能将这些理论解读为与“为第一世界哀歌”故事相矛盾，但也有可能想象，新形成的托瑞尔，从第一世界分裂而来，保留了对龙族完整理想的模糊记忆，然后经过数千年才得以显现。当然，托瑞尔的龙与{@book Monster Manual|MM}中描述的龙族原型非常接近，尽管巴哈摩特和提阿玛特有时在那个世界上以其他名字（如兹莫尔和特查扎）而闻名，但它们始终在世界神圣戏剧中扮演着重要角色。",

	"As one example, tales are told on multiple worlds of the Material Plane regarding the red dragon Ashardalon.

	"A dragon is causing problems, and the only solution is to get rid of the dragon. The dragon might be terrorizing the area near the lair, perhaps burning farmland and devouring livestock, demanding tribute from a village, or holding captives for ransom. Alternatively, a dragon might have established a new lair in the remote wilderness, driving other monsters out of the region and straight into inhabited lands. Or a dragon could be a pawn in a greater villain's schemes, perhaps a warlord who has acquired one of the {@item Orb of Dragonkind||Orbs of Dragonkind}. It might be possible to drive the dragon off or somehow change the dragon's behavior, but sometimes killing the dragon is the only option.": "一条龙正在制造麻烦，唯一的解决办法是消灭这条龙。这条龙可能正在靠近巢穴的地区制造恐慌，可能在烧毁农田和吞噬牲畜，向村庄要求贡品，或者绑架人质勒索赎金。另外，一条龙可能已经在偏远的荒野建立了新的巢穴，将其他怪物赶出该地区，直接进入有人居住的土地。或者一条龙可能是更大反派计划中的一个棋子，也许是一个获得了{@item Orb of Dragonkind||Orbs of Dragonkind}之一的军阀。也许可以赶走这条龙或者以某种方式改变这条龙的行为，但有时消灭这条龙是唯一的选择。",
	"An adventure featuring a dragon in a monster's role lends itself to a location-based structure. That location is likely the dragon's lair, since it's difficult to pin a dragon down for an all-out fight in most other sites.

	"If the gods are distant from their mortal worshipers in your campaign, making those gods dragons is largely an aesthetic choice that reinforces the importance of dragons. Perhaps the high priests of the gods are also dragons, or they could be draconians (described in {@book chapter 6|FTD|6|Draconians}), dragonborn, or half-dragons. Anyone with draconic ancestry or magic might be viewed as carrying a divine blessing in such a setting, and actual dragons would be regarded with reverential awe.": "如果在你的战役中，神祗与他们的凡间信徒相距甚远，那么将这些神祗塑造成龙，主要是一种美学选择，强调了龙的重要性。也许神的高阶祭司也是龙，或者他们可能是龙人（在{@book chapter 6|FTD|6|Draconians}中描述），龙裔，或者半龙人。在这样的背景下，任何具有龙族血统或魔法的人可能被视为携带着神圣的祝福，而实际的龙将被视为值得敬畏的存在。",

	"Regional effects sometimes give dragons unusual magical capabilities. For example, gold dragons can appear in the dreams of creatures that sleep near their lairs, green dragons can't be tracked near their lairs, brass dragons are aware of creatures that come near water in their territory, and gem dragons can use {@spell clairvoyance} to observe particular features near their lairs. Similar effects include the following examples:": "地域效应有时会赋予龙类异常的魔法能力。例如，金龙可以出现在靠近它们巢穴睡觉的生物的梦境中，绿龙在巢穴附近无法被追踪，黄铜龙能察觉到进入其领地附近水域的生物，而宝石龙可以使用{@spell clairvoyance}来观察其巢穴附近的特定特征。类似的效应包括以下示例：",
	"Like regional effects, a dragon's lair actions reflect an intimate connection to the magical energy that flows through and around the lair.
