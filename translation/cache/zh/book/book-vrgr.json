	"A scream shatters the still gloom. Inhuman shapes slip between crumbling tombs. The shadows reach forth. Do instincts and imagination conspire against you? Or have otherworldly evils claimed you, drawing you into the mists of Ravenloft?": "一声尖叫打破了寂静的阴霾。非人的身影在坍塌的墓穴间滑过。阴影伸向前方。本能和想象力在密谋对付你吗？或者是其他世界的邪恶占据了你，把你拉进拉文洛夫特的迷雾中？",
	"In hidden corners of the Shadowfell are nightmare domains that hunger for the brave and the innocent, the ambitious and the wicked. Some call this collection of eerie realms the Land of the Mists, but monster hunters know it as Ravenloft. Terror, magic, mystery, and suspense fill these fractured domains, an infinite gallery of unfolding evils, age-old plots, cursed bloodlines, legendary monsters, and immortal villains. Evildoers from countless worlds regard Ravenloft as their prison—infamous figures such as the lich-king Azalin Rex, the unscrupulous scientist Viktra Mordenheim, and the diabolical first vampire Strahd von Zarovich. These Darklords wield incredible power within their isolated domains, yet they're held captive in eternal torment as victims of malign forces known as the Dark Powers.": "在阴影之城的隐秘角落里，有一些噩梦般的领域，它们渴求着勇敢者和无辜者、野心家和邪恶者。有些人把这个阴森恐怖的国度称为 \"迷雾之地\"，但怪物猎人却把它称为 \"雷文洛夫特\"。恐怖、魔法、神秘和悬念充斥着这些支离破碎的领域，这是一个无限的画廊，里面有正在展开的邪恶、古老的阴谋、受诅咒的血统、传奇的怪物和不朽的恶棍。来自无数世界的邪恶之徒将雷文洛夫特视为他们的监狱，著名的人物包括巫妖王阿萨林-雷克斯（Azalin Rex）、不择手段的科学家维克特拉-莫登海姆（Viktra Mordenheim）和邪恶的第一吸血鬼斯特拉赫-冯-扎罗维奇（Strahd von Zarovich）。这些黑暗领主在其孤立的领域内拥有令人难以置信的力量，但他们作为被称为黑暗势力的邪恶力量的受害者，被关押在永恒的折磨中。",
	"Ravenloft is a fundamentally magical realm, one that takes its name from its most infamous haunted location, the dreaded Castle Ravenloft in Barovia—home of the notorious Strahd von Zarovich. In this mysterious setting, the land, the passage of time, the tides, and every other reliable truth can shift unpredictably. Rather than being bound by proximity or politics, the lands of Ravenloft—also known as the Domains of Dread—are mist-bound islands drifting through the boundless gloom of the Shadowfell. Innumerable domains lie hidden within these supernatural mists, and of these secret realms, the most terrifying are those born of your nightmares and given grim life through your adventures.": "拉文洛夫特是一个基本的魔幻王国，它的名字来自于其最臭名昭著的闹鬼地点--位于巴罗维亚的可怕的拉文洛夫特城堡--臭名昭著的斯特拉赫-冯-扎罗维奇。在这个神秘的环境中，土地、时间的流逝、潮汐和其他所有可靠的事实都会发生不可预知的变化。拉文洛夫特（Ravenloft）的土地--也被称为恐惧之域--不是被距离或政治所束缚，而是被雾气所束缚的岛屿，在阴影之城的无边阴暗中漂流。在这些超自然的迷雾中隐藏着无数的领域，而在这些秘密的领域中，最可怕的是那些从你的噩梦中诞生的，并通过你的冒险赋予其严峻的生命。",
	"Although Ravenloft is a setting of storied evils, the domains aren't without heroes. Brave souls such as the investigator Ez d'Avenir, the monster-hunting Weathermay-Foxgrove sisters, and the scholar Rudolph van Richten explore the domains' secrets. Though few in number, such adventurers represent defiant lights that shine like beacons through the darkness, and characters from all lands and worlds may be eager—or compelled—to challenge the sinister forces lurking in the shadows.": "虽然Ravenloft是一个充满邪恶传说的环境，但该领域并不是没有英雄。勇敢的灵魂，如调查员Ez d'Avenir、猎杀怪物的Weathermay-Foxgrove姐妹，以及学者Rudolph van Richten，都在探索这片领域的秘密。虽然数量不多，但这样的冒险家代表着像灯塔一样照亮黑暗的反抗之光，来自所有土地和世界的角色都可能渴望或被迫挑战潜伏在阴影中的邪恶力量。",

	"We continue our pursuit of that were-wretch, Natalia Vhorishkova. Before she fled our last confrontation, she shed a cord threaded through a wolf's tooth. Laurie used the talisman as you and Uncle George taught us, and it guided us through the Mists to Skald, a quaint, music-loving place in a land called Kartakass. The folk here are hospitable. Fawning actually. They hang on our every word. I've escaped their attentions by sequestering myself in our room at a local taverna while Laurie overindulges in attention for both of us. We've found no trace of Vhorishkova since arriving, but I feel her watching. It's like she's everywhere.": "我们继续追捕那个卑鄙小人，纳塔利娅-弗里什科娃。在她逃离我们的最后一次对抗之前，她流下了一根穿在狼牙上的绳子。劳里按照你和乔治叔叔教给我们的方法使用了这个护身符，它引导我们穿过迷雾，来到斯卡尔德，一个古色古香、热爱音乐的地方，叫做卡塔卡斯。这里的人很好客。实际上是献媚。他们对我们的每句话都很关注。我把自己关在当地一家小酒馆的房间里，躲避他们的关注，而劳里则为我们两个人过度关注。自从到达后，我们没有发现霍里什科娃的踪迹，但我感觉到她在监视。好像她无处不在。",
	"It's bad here, Uncle. Not snake-headed hogs bad. Like, full Delmunster plant-peasants bad. I've enclosed the tooth we followed here. If this message finds you free and well, your presence and perspective would be an enormous comfort.": "这里很糟糕，叔叔。不是蛇头猪的问题。是完全的德尔蒙斯特植物--豌豆的坏。我在这里附上了我们跟踪的牙齿。如果这条消息能让你获得自由和健康，你的存在和观点将是一个巨大的安慰。",
	"Countless mysteries pervade the Domains of Dread, but these strange truths underpin the setting:": "无数的谜团充斥着恐惧之域，但这些奇怪的真相支撑着这个环境。",
	"The lands and characters of Ravenloft don't share a planet. Rather, the Domains of Dread consist of innumerable demiplanes hidden amid the Plane of Shadow. Mysterious Mists surround each of these island-realms. The bravest souls might creep from one domain to another, but doing so involves considerable danger, and many who enter the Mists are never seen again.": "拉文洛夫特的土地和人物并不共享一个星球。相反，恐惧之域由隐藏在阴影地带的无数个半位面组成。神秘的迷雾围绕着每一个岛国。最勇敢的灵魂可能会从一个领域爬到另一个领域，但这样做涉及到相当大的危险，许多进入迷雾的人再也没有见过。",
	"Sinister entities known as the Dark Powers manipulate the Domains of Dread and all who dwell within. Immortal, unknowable, and omnipotent, the Dark Powers revel in sowing terror and subtly manipulating their captives over the course of generations.": "被称为黑暗势力的邪恶实体操纵着恐惧之域和所有居住在其中的人。黑暗势力是不朽的、不可知的、无所不能的，他们陶醉于播种恐怖，并在几代人的时间里巧妙地操纵着他们的俘虏。",
	"Ravenloft's demiplanes range in size from solitary structures to vast regions. These domains serve as the prisons of Darklords, villainous beings trapped and tormented by the Dark Powers. The specifics of each domain exist to ironically twist its Darklord's desires, capturing them and their lands' residents in cycles of dread and despair.": "拉文洛夫特的半位面大小不一，从孤独的建筑到广阔的区域。这些领域是黑暗领主的监狱，是被黑暗力量困住并折磨的恶棍。每个领域的具体情况都是为了讽刺地扭曲黑暗领主的欲望，在恐惧和绝望的循环中俘虏他们和他们土地上的居民。",
	"Supernatural haze suffuses the Domains of Dread. These are the Mists of Ravenloft, ominous fogs that gird each domain, rising and falling as the Dark Powers desire. Tales attribute ominous powers to the Mists, from cloaking monsters to causing entire villages to vanish. The Mists are not bound to Ravenloft and slip across the planes, potentially dragging anyone into the Domains of Dread.": "超自然的阴霾笼罩着恐惧之域。这就是拉文洛夫特的迷雾，不祥的雾气笼罩着每个领域，随着黑暗势力的发展而起伏。传说将不祥的力量归于迷雾，从隐身怪物到导致整个村庄消失。迷雾并不拘泥于拉文洛夫特，它在各个星球间游走，可能会把任何人拖入恐惧之域。",
	"The Mists of Ravenloft are notorious for kidnapping innocent souls and trapping them within the Domains of Dread, but they also collect characters to participate in specific terrifying adventures. Ravenloft can claim a soul for one night of terror or for an inescapable nightmare, whichever suits the needs of your adventures.": "拉文洛夫特的迷雾因绑架无辜的灵魂并将他们困在恐惧之域中而臭名昭著，但他们也会收集角色来参与特定的恐怖冒险。拉文洛夫特可以在一个恐怖的夜晚或一个无法逃脱的噩梦中索要一个灵魂，以适合你的冒险的需要为准。",
	"Ravenloft is not a land of heroes. Few seek out danger in the Mists or challenge Darklords. Fear and forces within characters themselves—potentially in the form of rare lineages or Dark Gifts—threaten personal dooms. Yet those who face these terrors shine as lights amid the Mists, beacons to attract other heroes but also greater threats.": "拉文洛夫特并不是一片英雄的土地。很少有人在迷雾中寻找危险或挑战黑暗领主。恐惧和人物自身的力量--可能以稀有血统或黑暗天赋的形式--威胁着个人的末日。然而，那些面对这些恐怖的人在迷雾中闪耀着光芒，是吸引其他英雄的灯塔，也是更大的威胁。",
	"The Domains of Dread provide malleable settings for any kind of horror adventure. As domains are unmoored from conventional reality, anything can happen within their borders. Normal people undergo terrifying transformations, whole villages disappear unnoticed, and the Mists bar every method of escaping a threat. Any surreal development you desire is also the will of the Dark Powers, assuring that the most terrifying possibilities come to pass. As a result, even the most familiar races, magic items, and monsters in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, and {@book Monster Manual|MM} have places in Ravenloft, but with twists that make them creepy or mysterious.": "恐惧之域为任何类型的恐怖冒险提供了可塑的环境。由于领域与传统的现实脱节，任何事情都可能在其边界内发生。正常人会发生可怕的转变，整个村庄会在不知不觉中消失，而迷雾会阻止每一种逃离威胁的方法。你想要的任何超现实的发展也是黑暗势力的意志，确保最可怕的可能性成为现实。因此，即使是{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}、{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}和{@book Monster Manual|MM}中最熟悉的种族、魔法物品和怪物，在《雷文洛夫特》中也有一席之地，但会有一些转折，使它们变得令人毛骨悚然或神秘。",
	"Although the Domains of Dread are dramatically different, certain realities underpin their terrors. The nature of domains, the influence of Darklords, the mysteries of the Mists, and the machinations of the Dark Powers present a wealth of ominous possibilities. All these elements share a shadowy uncertainty and the potential for terror to take on unpredictable forms.": "虽然恐惧之域有很大的不同，但某些现实是其恐怖的基础。领域的性质、黑暗领主的影响、迷雾的奥秘以及黑暗势力的阴谋诡计呈现出大量不祥的可能性。所有这些因素都有一个朦胧的不确定性，以及恐怖的潜在的不可预知的形式。",
	"The following sections are written for you, the DM, to consider and incorporate into your adventures as you see fit. If you wish to reveal the core mysteries of Ravenloft to your players and explore the Land of the Mists with shared knowledge, by all means do so. Alternatively, you can cultivate dread by leaving the fundamental truths of the world vague or defined by your group's theories. Deep shadows immerse the Domains of Dread. Whether you cast light on them or leave them an inky mystery, their potential for terror remains endless.": "以下章节是为你--DM--而写的，你可以根据自己的需要考虑并纳入你的冒险。如果你想向你的玩家揭示雷文洛夫特的核心奥秘，并在共享知识的情况下探索迷雾之地，尽可以这样做。另外，你也可以通过让世界的基本真理模糊不清或由你的团体的理论定义来培养恐惧感。深邃的阴影浸透了恐惧之域。无论你是给它们投以光明，还是给它们留下一个墨色的谜团，它们的恐怖潜力都是无穷的。",
	"By the standards of what other worlds' inhabitants consider true and sane, the Domains of Dread don't make sense. The setting's domains don't neatly flow into one another, histories don't record a collectively remembered past, fictions spawn terrible facts, and sheltered villagers remain stubbornly ignorant about the world beyond. Ravenloft is a setting designed to cultivate uncertainty, mystery, paranoia, and dread in defiance of logic or common sense.": "以其他世界的居民认为真实和理智的标准来看，恐惧之域是没有意义的。设定中的领域并不整齐地相互连接，历史并不记录集体记忆中的过去，虚构的东西会产生可怕的事实，而受庇护的村民对外面的世界仍然固执地一无所知。拉文洛夫特是一个旨在培养不确定性、神秘感、偏执狂和无视逻辑或常识的恐惧的设定。",
	"The characters in your Ravenloft adventures might be the first to inquire after obvious inconsistencies or to notice plain impossibilities. But why has no one before them sought answers to such unignorable questions? The Dark Powers, the Mists, and the nature of domains and Darklords all claim part of the answer, but ultimately they reflect aspects of the same cause: nightmare logic.": "你的Ravenloft冒险中的人物可能是第一个询问明显的不一致或注意到明显的不可能的人。但是，为什么在他们之前没有人去寻找这些不可忽视的问题的答案？黑暗势力、迷雾、领域和黑暗领主的性质都要求得到部分答案，但最终它们反映了同一个原因的各个方面：噩梦般的逻辑。",
	"Ravenloft is inherently a vast nightmare. Most of those who experience its terrors never suspect its surreal nature; only a few gradually realize that things don't add up. Whether they do or don't, the setting's supernatural features and malicious masterminds exist to foster terror. The details described in this section are true, but truth is malleable in Ravenloft. The exact limits of the Dark Powers' influence, the Mists' reach, and the Darklords' control over their domains are purposefully vague.": "拉文洛夫特本来就是一个巨大的噩梦。大多数经历过它的恐怖的人从未怀疑它的超现实性质；只有少数人逐渐意识到事情不对劲。无论他们是否有，这个设定的超自然特征和恶意的主谋都是为了制造恐怖。本节描述的细节是真实的，但在雷文洛夫特，真相是可塑的。黑暗势力的影响、迷雾的范围以及黑暗领主对其领域的控制的确切界限是有意模糊的。",
	"As with any nightmare, the Domains of Dread aren't shackled to the laws of reality. Domains exist not to simulate a believable world, but to terrify. This flexibility provides a powerful tool to upend assumptions of safety and tailor your characters' struggles. It also encourages layers of mysteries about the nature of the setting. Is each domain unique or just one in a series of recurring nightmares? How many forms of Castle Ravenloft exist, have existed, and will yet reveal themselves in the Mists? What is truth among the Domains of Dread, and how long will that remain certain? The answers are for you to decide.": "与任何恶梦一样，\"恐惧之域 \"并不受现实法则的束缚。领域的存在不是为了模拟一个可信的世界，而是为了吓唬人。这种灵活性提供了一个强大的工具，可以颠覆安全的假设，并为你的角色定制斗争。它还鼓励对环境的性质进行层层揭秘。每个领域都是独一无二的，还是只是一系列反复出现的噩梦中的一个？拉文洛夫特城堡有多少种形式存在，曾经存在，并将在迷雾中显现出来？恐惧之域中的真相是什么，这一点还能保持多久？答案将由你来决定。",
	"With this in mind, be aware that this book contains suggestions for adventures meant to be horrifying. While these plots are no more explicit than those you might find in any other Dungeons & Dragons product, the horror genre in all its myriad forms is explored—from moody gothic horror and ghost stories to visceral body horror and mind-bending cosmic horror. {@book Chapter 2|VRGR|2} explores how to choose the horror themes that are right for your game, but read on at your discretion.": "考虑到这一点，请注意这本书包含了一些旨在制造恐怖的冒险的建议。虽然这些情节并不比你在其他龙与地下城产品中找到的情节更明确，但我们探讨了各种形式的恐怖类型--从情绪化的哥特式恐怖和鬼故事到内脏的身体恐怖和令人心惊肉跳的宇宙恐怖。{@book Chapter 2|VRGR|2}探讨了如何选择适合你的游戏的恐怖主题，但继续阅读请自行决定。",

To what end, no one knows.": "深不可测的隐秘力量操纵着拉文洛夫特中的生命、死亡和现实。这些神秘的、没有死亡的生命是 \"恐惧之域 \"的设计者，他们将这些恐怖的区域隐藏在阴影之界的深处。黑暗势力监视并影响他们统治范围内的事件。当他们的视线偏离时，他们就会将手伸向其他星球，收集英雄和恶棍来增加他们可怕的动物。为了什么目的，没有人知道。",
	"The Dark Powers don't move in the shadows of Ravenloft; they are the shadows. They're the Mists and the darkness. They're the reason water manifests as rivers and stars appear in skies divorced from universes. They are the wardens that hold the Darklords prisoner. Ever-present and inscrutable, the Dark Powers are akin to gods in Ravenloft, but they are unknown to mortals and desire no worship.": "黑暗势力并不在雷文洛夫特的阴影中活动，他们就是阴影。他们是迷雾和黑暗。他们是水表现为河流和星星出现在脱离宇宙的天空中的原因。他们是囚禁黑暗领主的看守者。黑暗势力无处不在，高深莫测，在雷文洛夫特类似于神明，但他们不为凡人所知，也不希望受到崇拜。",
	"Despite the control the Dark Powers exert, these beings remain distant from the domains they manipulate. Although some of their names whisper through sinister lore—names like Osybus, Shami-Amourae, and Tenebrous—domain inhabitants know almost nothing of the Dark Powers. While some Darklords realize they're imprisoned by antagonistic entities, discourse regarding the Dark Powers remains the province of soothsayers, obsessed scholars, and otherworldly beings. Anyone who spreads tales of sinister forces manipulating reality is ignored or worse. For residents of Ravenloft, ignorance provides a well-defended shelter against unfathomable truths.": "尽管黑暗势力施加了控制，但这些生命仍然远离他们所操纵的领域。虽然他们的一些名字在险恶的传说中低语--如奥西伯斯（Osybus）、沙米-阿莫拉（Shami-Amourae）和特尼布拉斯（Tenebrous）--但领域内的居民几乎对黑暗力量一无所知。虽然有些黑暗领主意识到他们被敌对的实体所囚禁，但关于黑暗力量的讨论仍然是占卜师、痴迷的学者和其他世界的人的事情。任何传播操纵现实的邪恶力量的故事的人都会被忽视，甚至更糟。对于拉文洛夫特的居民来说，无知为他们提供了一个抵御深不可测的真相的良好庇护。",
	"The true nature of the Dark Powers is for you to decide. How you perceive these forces can influence your view of their actions and agendas, who they abduct into Ravenloft and why. Through your adventures, you might reveal these mysteries and use them to hint at ways to escape the Domains of Dread. Consider the following possibilities when developing your perspective on the Dark Powers:": "黑暗势力的真正性质由你来决定。你如何看待这些力量，可以影响你对他们的行动和议程的看法，他们把谁绑架到拉文洛夫特，以及为什么。通过你的冒险，你可能会揭开这些谜团，并利用它们来暗示逃离恐惧之域的方法。在发展你对黑暗势力的看法时，请考虑以下可能性。",
	"The Dark Powers are a group of powerful beings who believe they're beyond morality. They identify dangerous individuals and imprison them within the Domains of Dread, where they ostensibly do less harm than they would if they were free. Those trapped along with the Darklords are acceptable sacrifices.": "黑暗势力是一群强大的生物，他们相信自己是超越道德的。他们识别危险人物并将他们囚禁在恐惧之域中，表面上看，他们在那里的伤害比他们自由时要小。那些与黑暗势力一起被困的人是可以接受的牺牲品。",
	"The Dark Powers are embodiments of evil, mysterious entities of the Plane of Shadow, or a conspiracy of wicked gods. They treat the denizens of the Domains of Dread as their playthings, sowing fears and fomenting despair. This pleases or sustains them, or perhaps they're searching for individuals worthy of joining their ranks.": "黑暗势力是邪恶的化身，是阴影世界的神秘实体，或者是邪恶的神的阴谋。他们把恐惧之域的居民当作他们的玩物，播种恐惧，煽动绝望。这使他们高兴或维持，或者他们正在寻找值得加入他们行列的人。",
	"The Dark Powers are all that remain of a multitude of vanquished evil deities and demigods. Traces of their power linger in amber sarcophagi scattered throughout the Domains of Dread. These diminished vestiges manipulate their realm to create negative forces that sustain their essence and build toward renewed apotheosis.": "黑暗势力是众多被征服的邪恶神灵和半神所留下的一切。他们力量的痕迹在散落在恐惧之域的琥珀石棺中徘徊。这些被削弱的残余操纵着他们的领域，创造出负面的力量来维持他们的本质，并朝着重新神化的方向发展。",

The Mists confound travel between domains, whether one wishes to leave a place to reach another land or to escape the realm they're in.": "恐惧之域的居民知道迷雾，并赋予它们险恶的故事，但他们接受迷雾是他们家园的一个自然组成部分。许多在各域之间旅行的人甚至把他们的世界称为迷雾之国。任何超自然的事件、莫名其妙的消失或恶意的力量都可以归咎于迷雾，而那些与迷雾互动或来自迷雾之外的人都会受到怀疑。迷雾混淆了领域之间的旅行，无论一个人是想离开一个地方到达另一个地方还是想逃离他们所在的领域。",
	"Beyond these truths, the Mists are your tool to establish the boundaries of your horror stories. See the \"{@book Nature of Ravenloft|VRGR|3|Nature of Ravenloft}\" section in {@book chapter 3|VRGR|3} for details on employing the Mists to focus your horror adventures, leading characters to engage with certain elements while cloaking others in mystery.": "除了这些真相，迷雾是你建立恐怖故事边界的工具。请参阅{@book chapter 3|VRGR|3}中的\"{@book Nature of Ravenloft|VRGR|3|Nature of Ravenloft} \"部分，了解关于使用迷雾来聚焦你的恐怖冒险的细节，引导角色参与某些元素，同时为其他元素披上神秘的面纱。",

	"The domains vary in size from countries or geographic regions to a single city, structure, mobile conveyance, or specific location.": "域的大小不一，从国家或地理区域到单个城市、结构、移动运输工具或特定地点。",
	"Each domain is surrounded by the Mists, its boundaries fading away into haze. Domains share neither borders nor common geography, and you can't peer from one domain into another. The environments, cultures, and residents of one domain don't influence those of other domains.": "每个领域都被迷雾所包围，其边界渐渐消失在雾气中。各个领域既没有共同的边界，也没有共同的地理环境，你无法从一个领域窥视到另一个领域。一个域的环境、文化和居民不会影响其他域的环境、文化和居民。",
	"Domains exist to contain and torment a villain. Though Darklords exert control over their domains, they are each tormented by a personal terror playing out in their realm.": "领域的存在是为了遏制和折磨一个恶棍。尽管黑暗君主对他们的领域进行了控制，但他们每个人都被他们领域中的个人恐怖所折磨着。",
	"Those who run afoul of a Darklord might find that the Mists prevent them from leaving the villain's domain. Like a haunted house that conveniently seals its doors or summons a deadly storm, so do domains create inescapable spaces where horror adventures unfold.": "那些触犯黑暗领主的人可能会发现，迷雾使他们无法离开恶棍的领地。就像鬼屋方便地封住门或召唤出致命的风暴一样，领域也创造了无法逃避的空间，恐怖的冒险在这里展开。",
	"Each domain reflects its Darklord and facilitates horror tales related to that villain. Just as creepy manors suit ghostly inhabitants, so does each domain inspire and encourage a distinct type of terror.": "每个领域都反映了它的黑暗领主，并促进了与该反派有关的恐怖故事。就像令人毛骨悚然的庄园适合幽灵般的居民一样，每个领域都会激发和鼓励一种独特的恐怖类型。",

	"The nature of Ravenloft provides powerful tools to craft tales of terror. Shifting reality, inescapable danger, and foes with shocking powers are useful for creating horror adventures (a topic further discussed in {@book chapter 4|VRGR|4}). As a balancing factor, use these tools judiciously and occasionally, in the characters' favor. The Dark Powers delight in tormenting villains as much as they do innocents, the Mists equally confound both predators and prey, and Darklords frequently exhibit hubris or other exploitable flaws. Use Ravenloft's nature to sow dread but also to inspire hope. Relentless despair gradually beats characters down and takes the fun out of adventures. Punctuate your horror tales with moments of relief, comedy, and fortuitous coincidences. These moments of hope help characters push through the dark to the thrill of dawn.": "拉文洛夫特的性质为制作恐怖故事提供了强有力的工具。变化的现实、无法逃避的危险和拥有令人震惊的力量的敌人对于创造恐怖的冒险是非常有用的（这个话题在{@book chapter 4|VRGR|4}中进一步讨论）。作为一个平衡因素，明智地、偶尔地使用这些工具，对人物有利。黑暗势力喜欢折磨恶棍，就像他们折磨无辜者一样，迷雾同样让捕食者和猎物感到困惑，而黑暗领主经常表现出傲慢或其他可利用的缺陷。利用拉文洛夫特的性质来播种恐惧，同时也激发希望。无情的绝望会逐渐击垮角色，并使冒险的乐趣消失。用解脱、喜剧和偶然的巧合的时刻来补充你的恐怖故事。这些希望的时刻可以帮助人物冲破黑暗，迎接黎明的到来。",
	"Central to each domain is a Darklord, the seed from which a thorny thicket blooms. The villain might be a nation's leader, a prominent citizen, a notorious monster, a mysterious recluse, or a seemingly innocuous character. Regardless of the Darklord's current role, their wickedness led to the creation of their domain and their imprisonment in Ravenloft.": "每个领域的核心是一个黑暗领主，它是荆棘丛生的种子。这个恶棍可能是一个国家的领导人，一个著名的公民，一个臭名昭著的怪物，一个神秘的隐士，或者一个看起来无害的人物。无论黑暗领主目前的角色是什么，他们的邪恶导致了他们的领域的建立和他们在雷文洛夫特的监禁。",

	"Each Darklord is the ultimate villain of a domain and the root of the suffering and terror that unfold there.": "每个黑暗领主都是一个领域的终极恶棍，也是在那里展开的痛苦和恐怖的根源。",
	"Darklords cannot leave their domains. If a Darklord enters the Mists or uses another method to attempt an escape, the Dark Powers return them to their domain. Even death rarely allows a Darklord to escape their prison for long.": "黑暗领主不能离开他们的领地。如果一个黑暗领主进入迷雾或使用其他方法试图逃跑，黑暗势力会将他们送回他们的领域。即使是死亡也很少能让黑暗领主长久地逃离他们的监狱。",

	"Although Darklords hate their domains, they exert considerable control over them. This might be the influence of a governmental leader, the magic of a supernatural overlord, or a more fundamental connection.

	"Darklords range from monstrous tyrants to depraved individuals who otherwise appear as ordinary people. A Darklord's position and powers stem from their deeds, not their game statistics. While some Darklords are deadly or possess foul gifts from the Dark Powers, many pose little threat in battle. Their menace is the result of capabilities beyond physical prowess.": "黑暗领主的范围从畸形的暴君到堕落的个人，否则就像普通人一样。黑暗领主的地位和权力来自他们的行为，而不是他们的游戏数据。虽然有些黑暗领主是致命的，或者拥有来自黑暗力量的肮脏的礼物，但许多人在战斗中并不构成威胁。他们的威胁来自于超越身体力量的能力。",
	"Darklords might brood over their failures, but nevertheless they relentlessly strive to achieve their ambitions. Their desperate struggles fuel their conflicts with characters. Liberally use Darklords in your adventures rather than saving them for distant climactic plots.": "黑暗统治者可能会对他们的失败耿耿于怀，但尽管如此，他们还是不懈地努力实现他们的野心。他们绝望的挣扎助长了他们与角色的冲突。在你的冒险中自由地使用黑暗君主，而不是把他们留到遥远的高潮情节中。",
	"With a few exceptions, Darklords don't realize they occupy a special place in the world. Their agendas, obsessions, and egotism distract them from focusing on the strangeness of the world and petty concerns such as eerie fog.": "除了少数例外，黑暗君主并没有意识到他们在这个世界上占据了一个特殊的位置。他们的议程、痴迷和自负分散了他们的注意力，使他们无法专注于这个世界的奇怪之处，以及诸如阴森的雾气等琐碎的问题。",
	"Darklords are casually immortal, many having no concept of how long they've lived, how many times they've died, or why they returned to life. Should a Darklord fall, the temporary defeat lasts until they're restored by the Dark Powers. In their absence, those who sought to escape or supplant them seize their chance.": "黑暗领主是随意不死的，许多人对自己活了多久，死了多少次，或者为什么复活都没有概念。如果一个黑暗领主倒下了，暂时的失败会持续到他们被黑暗势力恢复。在他们不在的时候，那些试图逃离或取代他们的人抓住了机会。",
	"The Domains of Dread don't typically breed heroes. For the inhabitants of most domains, simply surviving the night is an act of courage. Those willing to confront the terrors of the Mists are rare, but when they do, they have one of the following origins:": "恐惧之域通常不孕育英雄。对于大多数领域的居民来说，仅仅是在黑夜中生存就是一种勇气的表现。那些愿意与迷雾的恐怖对抗的人很少，但当他们这样做时，他们有以下的起源之一。",
	"The Mists reached into these characters' worlds and dragged them into the Domains of Dread. Whether these adventurers are trapped in Ravenloft for a night or an eternity, their spirits mark them as outsiders but also as rare beacons in the endless darkness.": "迷雾伸进了这些人物的世界，把他们拖进了恐惧之域。无论这些冒险者是被困在雷文洛夫特一晚还是一世，他们的精神都标志着他们是外来者，但也是无尽黑暗中难得的灯塔。",

While {@book chapter 4|VRGR|4} guides DMs in how to craft atmospheric adventures, the spookiest scenarios will fall flat if you and the other players aren't prepared to engage with some degree of suspense. By the same token, the DM can't craft an enjoyably spooky experience if they're not aware of your interests in and thresholds for participating in fear-focused adventures. This section highlights elements common to frightening D&D games, features that you should be mindful of as a player and that will help you create a character prepared to participate in suspenseful adventures.": "拉文洛夫特鼓励你和你的团队安全地探索各种形式的鬼故事、神秘事件和其他恐怖故事的刺激。虽然{@book chapter 4|VRGR|4}指导DM如何制作大气的冒险，但如果你和其他玩家没有准备好参与某种程度的悬念，那么最诡异的场景也会变得平淡。同样，如果DM不了解你对恐惧冒险的兴趣和参与的门槛，就无法制作出令人愉快的幽灵体验。本节强调了可怕的D&D游戏中常见的元素，这些元素是你作为玩家应该注意的，它们将帮助你创造一个准备好参与悬念冒险的角色。",

	"These are all legitimate questions and ones you should have answers to before participating in a fear-focused D&D adventure. Horror, as a genre, covers broad swaths of material. What you shrug off other players might find personally unsettling—everyone's experiences and tolerances are distinct and real, even if they differ from your own. Before creating a character, ask your DM and the rest of the group the aforementioned questions, along with any others that come to mind. {@book Chapter 4|VRGR|4|Preparing for Horror} encourages DMs to facilitate pregame discussions to make sure the entire group agrees on content, boundaries, and tools to keep the terror fun. Think of this as establishing a film-like rating and content warning for the story you'll all be creating. If you're uncertain about aspects of the game, ask about them—before the game, during play, or whenever a concern arises. Everyone's comfort and enjoyment of spooky adventures are what matter most!": "这些都是合理的问题，在参加以恐惧为重点的D&D冒险之前，你应该有答案。恐怖，作为一种类型，涵盖了广泛的材料。你甩掉的东西，其他玩家可能会发现个人的不安--每个人的经历和容忍度都是独特和真实的，即使它们与你自己的不同。在创建角色之前，请向你的管理员和小组其他成员询问上述问题，以及任何其他想到的问题。{@book Chapter 4|VRGR|4|Preparing for Horror}鼓励管理员促进游戏前的讨论，以确保整个小组在内容、界限和工具上达成一致，以保持恐怖活动的乐趣。把这看作是为你们将要创作的故事建立一个类似电影的等级和内容警告。如果你对游戏的某些方面不确定，就问这些问题--在游戏前，在游戏过程中，或者在出现问题的时候。每个人对幽灵冒险的舒适和享受是最重要的。",
	"When planning to play a scary adventure, create a character prepared to be scared. Consider how your character reacts to being frightened and how that affects the creepy atmosphere of the adventure. Don't consider fear a tactical disadvantage or something to be avoided. As part of playing a frightening game, you're a participant in building and reinforcing a sense of dread for everyone at the table. If your character laughs in the face of every danger, they undermine the adventure's threats and its broader atmosphere.": "当计划玩一个可怕的冒险时，创造一个准备被吓到的角色。考虑你的角色在受到惊吓时的反应，以及这对冒险的惊悚气氛的影响。不要认为恐惧是一种战术上的劣势或需要回避的东西。作为玩一个可怕的游戏的一部分，你是一个参与者，为桌子上的每个人建立和加强恐惧感。如果你的角色面对每一个危险都笑，他们就会破坏冒险的威胁和更广泛的气氛。",
	"When creating and playing your character, consider courage not as the absence of fear but as the process of overcoming it. How might your character react in surprise before they rally to overcome the terror they face? Do they scream, flee, or freeze? Or might they throw themself into battle, perhaps recklessly or for too long? Record a default reaction on your character sheet so you can respond consistently when shocking events occur.": "在创造和扮演你的角色时，不要把勇气看作是没有恐惧，而要看作是克服恐惧的过程。在你的角色团结起来克服他们所面临的恐怖之前，他们可能会有怎样的惊讶反应？他们会尖叫、逃亡、还是僵住？或者他们可能会不顾一切地投入战斗，或者时间过长？在你的角色表上记录一个默认的反应，这样你就可以在震惊的事件发生时做出一致的反应。",
	"Beyond this, discuss with your group how much fear ties into the game's rules. Would you prefer to keep frightful reactions narrative, or would you like to use game rules that present additional challenges and benefits? Ask your DM about the possibility of using the rules for inspiration to motivate fearful character reactions, as detailed in the \"{@variantrule Fear and Stress|VRGR}\" section of {@book chapter 4|VRGR|4}. Using this system, a character who possesses particular fears and uses them to guide their responses to horrific scenes might earn inspiration for reinforcing the adventure's frightful atmosphere. The DM might not employ these rules every time something frightening occurs, but your group might use them as a way to highlight individual fears and build an adventure's overarching sense of dread.": "除此之外，与你的小组讨论恐惧与游戏规则的关系有多大。你是愿意保持恐惧反应的叙述性，还是愿意使用提出额外挑战和好处的游戏规则？问问你的DM，是否有可能使用规则来激发角色的恐惧反应，正如(%%)的\"{@variantrule Fear and Stress|VRGR} \"部分所详述的。使用这个系统，一个拥有特殊恐惧并利用它们来指导自己对恐怖场景的反应的角色可能会获得灵感，以加强冒险的恐怖气氛。管理员可能不会在每次发生可怕的事情时都使用这些规则，但你的小组可以用它们来突出个人的恐惧，并建立冒险的总体恐惧感。",
	"Not everyone exploring the Domains of Dread comes from those grim lands. Work with the DM to determine your character's origins. Has your character lived their entire life among the Mists?

	"Knowing what frightens your character provides insight into their past and can motivate their behavior. A character's fear of cats might stem from a terrible sight they witnessed at their grandmother's home, while a fear of earthquakes might hearken back to the experience of being trapped after a tremor. Consider two or three things that unsettle your character, what they tell you about their past, and if those fears shape who they are now.": "知道是什么让你的角色感到害怕，就能了解他们的过去，并能激发他们的行为。一个角色对猫的恐惧可能源于他们在祖母家看到的可怕景象，而对地震的恐惧可能源于地震后被困住的经历。考虑两三件让你的角色不安的事情，他们告诉你他们的过去，以及这些恐惧是否塑造了他们现在的形象。",
	"This book assumes you're playing a character who pits themself against fearful foes.

They claim rivers of blood are crimson due to natural clay deposits, the devilish lights in the swamp are nothing but swamp gas, and the current reclusive count is the descendant of the region's original reclusive count. Many of the domain's inhabitants are likely creations of the Dark Powers and the domain is the only reality they know, but what logical and psychological leaps might an outsider need to make to sleep at night?": "概述居民们用来假装没事的理由。什么可以合理地解释他们的超现实经历？他们声称血河是由于天然的粘土沉积物造成的深红色，沼泽中的恶魔之光不过是沼泽气体，而目前的隐居伯爵是该地区最初隐居伯爵的后代。该地区的许多居民可能是黑暗势力的创造物，该地区是他们所知道的唯一现实，但一个局外人可能需要做哪些逻辑和心理上的跳跃才能在晚上睡觉？",
	"As you develop your domain, consider the culture and how it emerges from this tragic setting. What might be most unsettling for the Darklord: if the culture is one with familiar strictures, one they opposed or were an outsider in, or something completely unknown or alien to them? While a domain's culture might take inspirations from fantastical or historical examples, remember that a domain isn't a functional or even logical construction. Domains are glimpses into the Darklord's static and often exaggerated or flawed perception of a time, place, or situation. A domain's inhabitants never develop, and they never reach their goals. A domain's oppressive inquisition is no closer to rooting out evil today than it was a thousand years ago. This isn't remarkable; it merely is as it has always been, and forces within a domain contort to maintain this status quo.": "当你发展你的领域时，考虑文化以及它是如何从这个悲惨的环境中出现的。对黑暗领主来说，什么可能是最令人不安的：如果这个文化是一个他们熟悉的限制，一个他们反对的或作为局外人的文化，还是一个对他们来说完全未知或陌生的东西？虽然一个领域的文化可能从幻想的或历史的例子中获得灵感，但请记住，一个领域并不是一个功能性的甚至是逻辑性的结构。领域是黑暗领主对某个时间、地点或情况的静态的、经常是夸张的或有缺陷的看法的一瞥。一个领域的居民从未发展，他们也从未达到他们的目标。一个领域的压迫性宗教裁判所今天并不比一千年前更接近于根除邪恶。这并不显著；它只是一直以来都是如此，而一个领域内的力量也在扭曲以维持这种现状。",

	"Body horror as a genre examines a universal fear: our own failing anatomies. We rarely think about what goes on beneath our skin. We understand that the organs operate in harmony: the heart beats, the lungs pump air, and the gastrointestinal system labors to supply us with nutrients. But we don't ponder the minutiae. Like whether embryonic parasites encyst in our brains, or what stage of cirrhosis we might be facing, or if tumors bloom deep in parts of ourselves we hope never to see.": "身体恐怖作为一种类型，审视了一种普遍的恐惧：我们自己失败的解剖学。我们很少考虑我们的皮肤下面发生了什么。我们知道各个器官在和谐地运作：心脏跳动，肺部泵送空气，胃肠系统努力为我们提供营养物质。但我们不会去思考那些细枝末节。例如，胚胎寄生虫是否在我们的大脑中寄生，或者我们可能面临肝硬化的哪个阶段，或者肿瘤是否在我们希望永远看不到的部位深处绽放。",

	"Gothic horror is about the terror within, not without. It shatters the illusion of humanity in a poignant way by holding a mirror up to us and saying: look at what we truly are, and look at what we pretend to be. Under that mask of civility, there is depravity. Under that thin veneer of society, there is wickedness. Under all the trappings of sophistication, are we not all predators or prey? Gothic horror shatters the lies we trick ourselves into believing and shows that we, not some distant entity, are and ever shall be the architects of our doom. The quest for perfection leads us to discover our own imperfection. Our quest for the divine leads us to believe we, ourselves, are gods. These are the themes that haunt stories of Gothic horror.": "哥特式恐怖是关于内部的恐怖，而不是外部的。它以一种凄美的方式打破了人类的幻觉，对我们举起一面镜子，说：看看我们真正是什么，看看我们假装是什么。在文明的面具下，存在着堕落。在社会的那层薄薄的外衣下，是邪恶的。在所有复杂的外衣下，我们不都是掠夺者或猎物吗？哥特式的恐怖打破了我们欺骗自己相信的谎言，并表明我们，而不是某个遥远的实体，是而且永远是我们厄运的设计者。对完美的追求使我们发现自己的不完美。我们对神性的追求使我们相信我们自己是神。这些都是萦绕在哥特式恐怖故事中的主题。",

	"In disaster horror adventures, the world has fallen to ruin—or it's getting there fast. The unthinkable has happened and, as a result, society is collapsing. In these tales, a monster or villain might be replaced by cascading catastrophes like those brought about by a meteor strike or volcanic eruption. Regardless of a hero's power, the best-timed critical hit or the most powerful spell might not fix a city ruined by an earthquake or a world ravaged by plagues.": "在灾难性的恐怖冒险中，世界已经沦为一片废墟--或者说它正在迅速沦陷。不可思议的事情发生了，结果是，社会正在崩溃。在这些故事中，怪物或恶棍可能会被像流星雨或火山爆发所带来的连环灾难所取代。无论英雄的力量如何，最适时的关键一击或最强大的法术都可能无法修复一个被地震毁坏的城市或被瘟疫蹂躏的世界。",

	"In all these cases, society breaks down. There are no inns to sleep in, healers are few or overtaxed, and anarchy rises as governments crumble. Environmental hazards, such as those in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, might be extreme and lead to scarcity of food or other resources. Scared innocents, opportunistic scavengers, and leaderless military forces all seek to survive. The hopeless acts of others might even prove more horrifying than the provoking disaster.": "在所有这些情况下，社会崩溃了。没有旅店可以睡觉，医护人员很少或被过度征用，无政府状态随着政府的崩溃而兴起。环境危害，如{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}，可能是极端的，导致食物或其他资源的匮乏。被吓坏的无辜者、投机取巧的拾荒者和没有领导的军队都在寻求生存。其他人无望的行为甚至可能被证明比挑起的灾难更令人恐惧。",
	"When creating adventures inspired by disaster horror, ask yourself the following questions:": "在创造由灾难恐怖启发的冒险时，要问自己以下问题。",

	"Adventures rooted in the occult detective genre straddle the line between fantasy, mystery, and horror. For the occult detective, solving paranormal mysteries is all part of the job. In these adventures, villains employ supernatural powers toward nefarious ends while characters act as detectives, interpreting events, learning patterns, deducing goals, and ultimately putting an end to the threat. investigation and cleverness take center stage in these adventures, though as in the noir stories that inspire the genre, there's plenty of room for action.": "植根于神秘学侦探流派的冒险活动跨越了幻想、神秘和恐怖之间的界限。对于神秘学侦探来说，解决超自然的谜团是工作的一部分。在这些冒险中，恶棍利用超自然的力量达到邪恶的目的，而人物则扮演侦探的角色，解释事件，学习模式，推断目标，并最终结束威胁。调查和聪明在这些冒险中占据中心位置，尽管在激发这一类型的黑色故事中，有大量的行动空间。",
	"Occult detective adventures can be just as terrifying as any other horror adventures, but also might be lighter in tone. Adventurers might experience terrors only after they've happened and face a foe only once they're prepared to end its threat. Of course, there are ways to create threats distinct to this genre, such as when villains view detectives as rivals or targets.": "神秘的侦探冒险可以像其他恐怖冒险一样令人恐惧，但也可能在语气上更轻松。冒险者可能会在恐怖发生后才经历恐怖，并且只有在他们准备结束威胁时才面对敌人。当然，也有一些方法可以创造出与这一类型不同的威胁，例如当反派将侦探视为对手或目标时。",
	"When creating an occult detective adventure, consider what monster, magic, or other supernatural force might lend a thrilling twist to some criminal enterprise. How will the characters catch an invisible assassin or a thief that pilfers extradimensional spaces? Once you know the villain's mode of operation, consider how it might give itself away. Even if you're not sure, listen to the characters' plans and give them opportunities to feel brilliant in the course of running your adventures.": "在创作神秘的侦探冒险故事时，要考虑什么怪物、魔法或其他超自然力量会给某些犯罪行为带来惊心动魄的变化。角色们将如何抓住一个无形的刺客或一个偷窃次元空间的小偷？一旦你知道了反派的行动方式，就要考虑它可能如何暴露自己。即使你不确定，也要听从人物的计划，在运行冒险的过程中，给他们机会感受到辉煌。",

	"When creating adventures rooted in psychological horror, consider common fears and anxieties. These readily become metaphors for villains and monsters. Fear of being judged by one's peers might manifest as a jury of nothics, while fear of change could be represented by a medusa that petrifies those who threaten her community's status quo.": "在创作植根于心理恐怖的冒险时，要考虑常见的恐惧和焦虑。这些很容易成为恶棍和怪物的隐喻。对被同龄人评判的恐惧可能表现为一个无名小卒的陪审团，而对变化的恐惧则可以由一个使那些威胁到她的社区现状的人石化的美杜莎来代表。",
	"Uncertainty, paranoia, and blurred lines between reality and fiction also shape psychological horror stories. In your adventures, this might take the form of unreliable information. Characters might experience a deadly encounter only to wake up at the end, not having previously realized they were asleep. Before undermining characters' senses, though, make sure you know what's driving these skewed perceptions and how characters might overcome them. The \"{@variantrule Fear and Stress|VRGR}\" section of {@book chapter 4|VRGR|4} provides options for dealing with the stress of adventuring. If some force is actively trying to cause stress for characters, this might lead to its own psychological horror adventure.": "不确定性、偏执狂和现实与虚构之间的模糊界限也塑造了心理恐怖故事。在你的冒险中，这可能采取不可靠的信息的形式。角色可能会经历一次致命的遭遇，但在最后醒来时却没有意识到自己在睡觉。不过，在破坏角色的感官之前，要确保你知道是什么在驱动这些歪曲的感知，以及角色如何克服这些感知。{@book chapter 4|VRGR|4}的\"{@variantrule Fear and Stress|VRGR} \"部分提供了处理冒险压力的选项。如果某种力量正积极地试图给角色造成压力，这可能会导致其自身的心理恐怖冒险。",

	"Every monster is a story, and many of those stories are horror stories. This brand of horror contends with relentless killers, which might be people or monsters.

	"Adventures of this genre typically include one major antagonist that threatens a group. This might be a particularly large or cunning beast, a murderer who terrorizes a neighborhood, a monster stalking a town, or a supernatural menace who spreads a signature sort of death. When creating your own monster or slasher horror adventures, choose a creature with a challenge rating high enough that your party won't defeat it with a few lucky hits. Also consider foes with details you're eager to explore in various terrifying scenes. A medusa, for example, becomes all the more terrifying when it murders with petrified body parts or forces victims into unsettling poses before petrifying them. Also, consider who the villain's targets are and why the villain has chosen to prey upon that group. Is it out of hunger or for revenge, or does the creature have a more deep seated need to kill?": "这种类型的冒险通常包括一个威胁到一个团体的主要对手。这可能是一个特别大的或狡猾的野兽，一个恐吓邻里的杀人犯，一个跟踪城镇的怪物，或者一个传播一种标志性死亡的超自然威胁。在创造你自己的怪物或屠杀者恐怖冒险时，要选择一个挑战等级足够高的生物，使你的队伍不会因为几次幸运的打击而打败它。还要考虑具有你急于在各种恐怖场景中探索的细节的敌人。例如，当冥王星用石化的身体部位进行谋杀或在石化受害者之前强迫他们摆出令人不安的姿势时，就会变得更加可怕。此外，还要考虑反派的目标是谁，以及反派为什么选择捕食这个群体。是出于饥饿或报复，还是该生物有更深层次的杀戮需求？",

	"Most Darklords can keep their domains' borders closed indefinitely and can reopen them at will. For some Darklords, slightly varied effects manifest when they close their domains. Others are limited in their ability to affect their borders. For each domain, specifics appear in the \"Closing the Borders\" portion of the section on that domain's Darklord.": "大多数黑暗领主可以无限期地关闭他们的领地边界，并可以随意地重新打开它们。对于一些黑暗领主来说，当他们关闭他们的领地时，会有稍微不同的效果表现出来。其他人影响其边界的能力是有限的。对于每一个领域，具体细节出现在关于该领域黑暗君主的 \"关闭边界 \"部分。",

	"Characters emerge from the Mists inside a structure somewhere within the domain they tried to leave, perhaps a cave, crypt, shed, or closet.": "角色从迷雾中出现在他们试图离开的领域内的某个结构中，也许是一个山洞、地窖、棚子或壁橱。",
	"Characters emerge from the Mists where they entered to find the domain changed. Perhaps someone the characters knew is gone, and no one has any knowledge of them ever existing.": "角色从他们进入的迷雾中走出来，发现这个领域已经改变。也许角色认识的人已经离开了，没有人知道他们曾经存在过。",
	"Characters emerge from the Mists on a world on the Material Plane. After {@dice 1d6} hours, the Mists rise around them once more. Roll again on this table.": "角色从迷雾中出现在物质界的一个世界上。在{@dice 1d6}小时后，他们周围的迷雾再次上升。在这张表格上再次滚动。",
	"A Mist talisman is a nonmagical object, akin to a dowsing rod or a lodestone, that resonates with the unique nature of the domain where it originates, allowing the creature holding it to find a path through the Mists to that domain. By holding the talisman and focusing on its domain of origin, a creature in the Mists can reach that domain after {@dice 2d6} hours of travel. Any creatures that willingly follow the creature with the Mist talisman also reach the same destination. A Mist talisman is no help to a creature imprisoned within a domain's closed borders. If the borders of the destination domain are closed, roll on the Wandering the Mists table to determine what happens.": "迷雾护符是一种非魔法物品，类似于测水棒或石块，能与它所在领域的独特性质产生共鸣，使持有它的生物能够找到一条穿过迷雾前往该领域的道路。通过持有护身符并专注于它的起源领域，迷雾中的生物可以在{@dice 2d6}小时的旅行后到达该领域。任何愿意跟随持有迷雾护符的生物的生物也会到达相同的目的地。迷雾护符对被囚禁在一个领域的封闭边界内的生物没有帮助。如果目的地领域的边界被关闭，请在 \"迷雾漫游 \"表上滚动以确定会发生什么。",
	"The domains detailed in this chapter suggest Mist talismans that can be used to reach them, but these aren't exhaustive lists. Use them as inspiration for Mist talismans of your own design.": "本章详述的领域提出了可用于达到这些领域的迷雾护符，但这些并不是详尽的清单。你可以把它们作为你自己设计的迷雾护符的灵感来源。",
	"The Dark Powers manipulate the domains and creatures within their grasp in the most fundamental ways, controlling magic, the nature of life and death, and the means of escaping from their nightmare realms.": "黑暗势力以最基本的方式操纵着他们掌握的领域和生物，控制着魔法、生与死的本质，以及逃离他们噩梦般境界的手段。",
	"In some domains, magic is an everyday part of life, while in others, insular communities fear it as the province of monsters. Few domains deny magic entirely or outlaw its use, but magic might be rare beyond the spellcasting of local healers or the power of the occasional family heirloom. It's up to you to decide how pervasive magic is in a domain, choosing whether a dearth or an excess of magic is more terrifying.": "在某些领域，魔法是生活的一部分，而在另一些领域，孤立无援的社区则担心魔法是怪物的专利。很少有领地完全否认魔法或禁止使用魔法，但除了当地治疗师的咒语或偶尔的传家宝的力量之外，魔法可能是罕见的。由你来决定魔法在一个领域中的普及程度，选择魔法的匮乏还是过剩更令人恐惧。",
	"In domains where inhabitants regard simple magic as remarkable, those inhabitants' lack of engagement with the supernatural doesn't mean you should limit magic for adventurers. Rather, use this as an opportunity to feature magic-using characters as figures of awe or terror, or to assign storied origins to common magic items.": "在那些居民认为简单的魔法是了不起的领域，这些居民缺乏与超自然现象的接触并不意味着你应该限制冒险者的魔法。相反，你可以利用这个机会将使用魔法的角色作为敬畏或恐怖的人物，或者为普通的魔法物品赋予故事性的起源。",
	"The Dark Powers influence magical effects, imparting them with sinister qualities. How these changes manifest are for you to decide and can shift from domain to domain. Do summoned creatures appear undead in one domain or violently mutated in another? Do divination spells rasp in the voices of otherworldly ancients? Do the effects of drinking a {@item potion of healing} feel like grubs weaving wounds shut from within? Magic looks menacing in the Domains of Dread, but descriptive embellishments shouldn't change the actual effects of spells or magic items.": "黑暗力量影响着魔法效果，使它们具有邪恶的品质。这些变化是由你来决定的，并且可以在不同的领域中变化。召唤的生物在一个领域里是不死的，在另一个领域里是暴力变异的？占卜的咒语是否会发出其他世界的古人的声音？饮用{@item potion of healing}的效果是否感觉像蛴螬从内部编织出的伤口？在恐惧之域中，魔法看起来很可怕，但描述性的修饰不应该改变法术或魔法物品的实际效果。",
	"Everyone among the Domains of Dread is a prisoner. The Darklords number among the most prominent captives, but every creature claimed by the Mists dwells outside the natural order of the multiverse. Even death doesn't afford an escape from the Dark Powers, which hoard every soul that falls into their clutches. In the Land of the Mists, death isn't an escape, but the beginning of a new terror.": "恐惧之域中的每个人都是囚犯。黑暗领主是最突出的俘虏之一，但每一个被迷雾领走的生物都生活在多元宇宙的自然秩序之外。即使是死亡也无法从黑暗势力手中逃脱，他们囤积了每一个落入他们魔掌的灵魂。在迷雾之地，死亡并不是一种逃避，而是一种新的恐怖的开始。",
	"Not every being among the Domains of Dread has a soul. Many inhabitants of each domain are creations of the Dark Powers, whose bodies have been formed from the land and the Mists. For all intents and purposes, and even under magical detection, these beings are what they appear to be. The Dark Powers fashion them as living puppets—individuals who live unremarkable lives that reinforce the status quo, culture, and frustration that torment a domain's Darklord.": "在恐惧之域中，并非每个生命都有灵魂。每个领域的许多居民都是黑暗势力的创造物，他们的身体由土地和迷雾形成。就所有的意图和目的而言，甚至在魔法检测下，这些生命都是他们的表象。黑暗势力将他们塑造成活生生的傀儡--他们过着不起眼的生活，强化了现状、文化和折磨一个领域的黑暗势力的挫折感。",
	"Individuals born in the Land of the Mists who have souls tend to be vibrant, imaginative, and ambitious. But they find these virtues stifled by the dour, soulless individuals who outnumber them, leading many to seek better lives and answers to the mysteries of their home domain. Every player's character who was born in a domain is one of these vibrant souls.": "出生在迷雾之地的有灵魂的人往往充满活力、富有想象力和野心。但他们发现这些美德被那些数量多于他们的沉闷、没有灵魂的人扼杀了，导致许多人寻求更好的生活和对他们家乡领域的神秘的答案。每个出生在某个领域的玩家的角色都是这些充满活力的灵魂之一。",
	"When a creature with a soul dies among the Domains of Dread, its spirit becomes caught in the Mists and can't travel to the afterlife. If a creature who has been dead for at least 24 hours returns to life by way of a spell or other supernatural means, it realizes that its spirit is trapped within the Mists, likely forever. Using the rules for \"{@variantrule Fear and Stress|VRGR}\" from {@book chapter 4|VRGR|4}, the creature gains a new Seed of Fear.": "当一个有灵魂的生物在恐惧之域中死亡时，它的灵魂会陷入迷雾之中，无法前往来世。如果一个已经死了至少24小时的生物通过法术或其他超自然的方式恢复了生命，它就会意识到它的灵魂被困于迷雾之中，很可能永远地被困住。使用{@book chapter 4|VRGR|4}中\"{@variantrule Fear and Stress|VRGR} \"的规则，该生物获得一个新的恐惧之种。",
	"If a being with a soul dies and is not returned to life, that soul remains trapped within the Domains of Dread until it is reincarnated, a process that can take decades. Individuals who inherit the same soul over generations often look alike and might recall memories of their past lives.": "如果一个有灵魂的人死后没有复活，这个灵魂就会一直被困在恐惧之域中，直到转世，这个过程可能需要几十年。几代人继承同一个灵魂的人往往看起来很像，并可能回忆起他们过去生活的记忆。",
	"The state of souls in the Domains of Dread provides a dose of existential terror to those hoping to manipulate life and death to escape these realms. Beyond that, who does and doesn't have a soul among the domains rarely matters unless an adventure explores themes of life, death, and reincarnation. Players might create ties with long-dead individuals using the {@book Dark Gifts|VRGR|1} and {@book backgrounds|VRGR|1} presented in {@book chapter 1|VRGR|1}. But overall, spiritual stagnation in the Land of the Mists is meant to provide the opportunity for grim revelations, not existential bookkeeping.": "恐惧之域中的灵魂状态为那些希望操纵生死以逃离这些领域的人提供了一剂生存的恐怖。除此之外，在这些领域中谁有灵魂和谁没有灵魂很少有关系，除非冒险探索了生命、死亡和转世的主题。玩家可能会利用{@book chapter 1|VRGR|1}中提出的{@book Dark Gifts|VRGR|1}和{@book backgrounds|VRGR|1}与死去已久的人建立联系。但总的来说，迷雾之地的精神停滞是为了提供严峻的启示的机会，而不是存在主义的簿记。",
	"While in the Domains of Dread, characters who receive spells from deities or otherworldly patrons continue to do so. In addition, spells that allow contact with beings from other planes function normally, with one proviso: the domain's Darklord senses when someone in their domain casts such a spell and can choose to make themself the spell's target, so that they become the one who is contacted.": "在恐惧之域中，从神灵或其他世界的赞助者那里接受法术的角色继续这样做。此外，允许与其他位面的生命接触的法术也能正常运作，但有一个条件：当他们领域的人施展这样的法术时，领域的黑暗领主会察觉，并可以选择让自己成为法术的目标，这样他们就会成为被联系到的人。",
	"The realities of the Domains of Dread seem strange or impossible to individuals from other worlds, but for those who live among the Mists, they're facts of life. With no basis for comparison, domain inhabitants call those who speak of other worlds liars. For them, the following topics are standard aspects of life in their home domain or in a broader collection of domains they call the Land of the Mists.": "对于来自其他世界的人来说，恐惧之域的现实似乎很奇怪或不可能，但对于生活在迷雾中的人来说，它们是生活的事实。由于没有比较的基础，领域内的居民称那些谈论其他世界的人为骗子。对他们来说，以下话题是他们家乡领域或被称为 \"迷雾之地 \"的更广泛领域中的标准生活内容。",
	"Many domains mint their own gold, silver, and copper coins. Though these currencies bear different markings, merchants aren't particular about the designs stamped on coinage. A gold piece from Barovia spends as well in Borca as it does in Har'Akir, as long as it weighs true. Platinum and electrum coins rarely circulate through the domains, but they appear often enough—originating from hidden troves or ancient vaults—that no trader questions their value.": "许多领域都铸造了自己的金币、银币和铜币。虽然这些货币有不同的标记，但商人们对印在钱币上的设计并不挑剔。一块来自巴罗维亚的金币在博尔卡和在哈克尔的消费一样好，只要它的重量是真实的。铂金和银币很少在各地区流通，但它们经常出现--或来自隐藏的宝库或古老的金库--所以没有商人质疑它们的价值。",
	"By impossible coincidence, all domains share a language despite their profoundly different origins: Common, which functions as a shared tongue throughout the Land of the Mists. Beyond this, all the other languages noted in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} and {@book Monster Manual|MM} are spoken among the Domains of Dread, some more pervasively than others. The same language spoken in multiple domains might bear subtle differences or unique words. Speakers from different domains might also have distinct accents, but their words are understandable.": "由于不可能的巧合，所有的领域都有一种语言，尽管它们的起源截然不同。通用语，它作为整个迷雾之地的共同语言发挥作用。除此之外，{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}和{@book Monster Manual|MM}中提到的所有其他语言都在恐惧之域中使用，有些比其他语言更普遍。在多个领域使用的同一种语言可能会有细微的差异或独特的词汇。来自不同领域的说话者也可能有明显的口音，但他们的话是可以理解的。",
	"In many domains, locals maintain chilly relationships with aloof deities, knowing \"the gods\" only through hollow rituals and clergy with scant supernatural powers. Conversely, some people privately worship ancestral gods—deities of their family's tradition with whom they form deep, personal connections. Divergent faiths abound, and some that begin as charlatanry inexplicably gain the power of true faith. Ultimately, any deity from the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} or any other setting might find followers among the Domains of Dread. By the same token, the Dark Powers breathe life into the beliefs of cruel practices and the faiths of false zealots.": "在许多地区，当地人与冷漠的神灵保持着冷淡的关系，只通过空洞的仪式和没有超自然能力的神职人员了解 \"神\"。相反，有些人私下里崇拜祖先的神灵--他们家族传统中的神灵，与他们形成深刻的个人联系。不同的信仰比比皆是，有些开始时是骗人的，后来却莫名其妙地获得了真正信仰的力量。最终，任何来自{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}或任何其他背景的神灵都可能在恐惧之域中找到追随者。同样地，黑暗势力也为残忍的做法和虚假的狂热者的信仰注入了活力。",
	"One noteworthy exception to this is the worship of the god Ezra, which has its origins in the Mists (see the \"Ezra, God of the Mists\" sidebar). For your adventures, you define what deities are worshiped in a domain and whether those deities are actual gods, manifestations of the Dark Powers, or one masquerading as the other.": "一个值得注意的例外是对以斯拉神的崇拜，它起源于迷雾（见 \"以斯拉，迷雾之神 \"侧边栏）。在你的冒险中，你要定义一个领域中所崇拜的神灵，以及这些神灵是真正的神灵，还是黑暗势力的表现，或者是伪装成其他神灵。",
	"The denizens of several domains worship an aloof god known as Ezra. Depicted as a vague, vaporous figure, the god is known for her dark, billowing hair and for her ability to manipulate the Mists. Her holy symbol is a sprig of belladonna atop a silver kite shield. Beyond that, her disparate sects of worshipers view her differently—and contradictorily. For some, Ezra is a goodly guardian, while others perceive her as a soul-stealing embodiment of the Mists. Ultimately, though, her true nature is a mystery. Whether she's a manifestation of the Dark Powers, an aspect of the Plane of Shadow's mysterious Raven Queen, or something else entirely is for you to decide. Whatever the case, Ezra's followers, traditions, alignment, and the domains she grants her clerics vary widely. Collaborate with players who want to create characters devoted to Ezra to define the god's role in their domain of origin.": "几个领域的居民都崇拜一个冷漠的神，称为 \"埃兹拉\"。该神被描绘成一个模糊的、虚无缥缈的形象，以她那乌黑、飘逸的头发和操纵迷雾的能力而闻名。她的神圣标志是银色风筝盾牌上的一枝颠茄。除此之外，她的不同教派的崇拜者对她的看法各不相同，而且相互矛盾。对一些人来说，以斯拉是一个善良的守护者，而其他人则认为她是一个偷窃灵魂的迷雾化身。但最终，她的真实性质是一个谜。她是黑暗力量的表现，还是阴影世界神秘的乌鸦女王的一个方面，或者完全是其他什么东西，由你来决定。无论怎样，以斯拉的追随者、传统、结盟以及她授予她的牧师的领域都有很大不同。与那些想要创建献身于艾兹拉的角色的玩家合作，以确定该神在其起源领域的作用。",
	"The Domains of Dread don't share a unified calendar. However, in most domains, locals measure time by \"moons\" rather than months. As a measurement of time, each moon begins on the first night of a full moon and lasts a full lunar cycle. A year consists of twelve moons, or twelve lunar cycles. While domains don't ascribe to a shared history, the populace of all domains inexplicably accept the current year as 735. Some local histories cleave to anomalous dates and methods of tracking years, but these are considered obsolete. No such irregularities exist in Barovia, though, where year 1 corresponds with the founding of Barovia by the von Zarovich family.": "恐惧之域不共享统一的日历。然而，在大多数地区，当地人用 \"月亮 \"而不是月来衡量时间。作为对时间的衡量，每个月亮从满月的第一个晚上开始，持续一个完整的月球周期。一年由12个月亮组成，或12个月球周期。虽然各领域没有共同的历史，但所有领域的民众都莫名其妙地接受目前的年份为735。有些地方的历史会采用反常的日期和追踪年份的方法，但这些被认为是过时的。但在巴罗维亚不存在这种不正常的情况，第一年与冯-扎罗维奇家族建立巴罗维亚的时间相一致。",
	"In some domains, the residents are aware that realms exist beyond the Mists, but most have little interest in lands beyond their own. The Darklords' obsessions distract them from concerns about the nature of their domains or what lies beyond the Mists. This preoccupation, along with the lack of shared borders or reliable travel, means that mercantile ventures and military conquests between domains are essentially impossible.": "在一些领域，居民们意识到迷雾之外的领域存在，但大多数人对自己领域之外的土地没有兴趣。黑暗领主们的痴迷让他们无暇顾及自己领地的性质或迷雾之外的东西。这种专注，加上缺乏共同的边界或可靠的旅行，意味着域与域之间的商业冒险和军事征服基本上是不可能的。",
	"Due to the danger and unreliability of traveling the Mists, those few with interests beyond their home domains make letter writing their preferred method of communication. A group called the {@book Keepers of the Feather|VRGR|3|Keepers of the Feather} (detailed in the \"{@book Travelers in the Mists|VRGR|3}\" section later in this chapter) oversees a private network of carrier ravens that possesses the uncanny ability to navigate the Mists. These ravens deliver envelopes and tiny parcels between private rookeries maintained by the Keepers. Individuals and businesses friendly with the Keepers—such as a village notary or inn—might surreptitiously contract their services, allowing customers to send a letter for 1 gp. These letters must include a destination where another Keeper can receive them, then either hold or deliver the correspondence—with delivery costs an additional 1 gp. Letters take at least one day to deliver. The Keepers of the Feather make no assurances about the safe delivery of letters in their charge, but their services prove relatively reliable. Rumors speak of more expensive services the Keepers provide to select clients, such as delivery to individuals whose whereabouts are unknown or verbal messages relayed by talking ravens.": "由于在迷雾中旅行的危险和不可靠，那些对家乡领域之外感兴趣的少数人将写信作为他们的首选沟通方式。一个名为{@book Keepers of the Feather|VRGR|3|Keepers of the Feather}的团体（详见本章后面的\"{@book Travelers in the Mists|VRGR|3} \"部分）监管着一个由信鸽组成的私人网络，它拥有在迷雾中航行的不可思议的能力。这些乌鸦在守护者们维护的私人鸟巢之间运送信封和小包裹。与守护者友好的个人和企业--比如村里的公证人或旅馆--可能会偷偷地承包它们的服务，允许顾客以1戈比寄信。这些信件必须包括一个其他守护者可以接收它们的目的地，然后持有或递送信件--递送费用为额外的1戈比。信件至少需要一天时间才能送达。羽毛守护者对他们负责的信件的安全递送没有保证，但他们的服务被证明是相对可靠的。有传言说，守卫者为特定的客户提供更昂贵的服务，例如为下落不明的人送信或由会说话的乌鸦转达口头信息。",

The burgomaster, Baron Vargas Vallakovich, is convinced happiness holds the key to Vallaki's salvation, and so he convenes festival after bizarre festival with titles such as the Festival of the Blazing Sun, the Promenade of Coffins, and the Wolf's Head Jamboree. Additionally, numerous factions are active within the town, including the Keepers of the Feather and the priests of Osybus (see \"{@book Travelers in the Mists|VRGR|3|Keepers of the Feather}\" and \"{@book Other Groups|VRGR|3|Priests of Osybus},\" respectively, later in this chapter).": "与巴罗维亚的其他地方隔绝，瓦拉基起初看起来是一个奇怪的快乐的地方，但这种看似快乐的感觉是一种错觉。市长巴尔加斯-瓦拉科维奇男爵坚信幸福是瓦拉基的救命稻草，因此他召集了一个又一个怪异的节日，如烈日节、棺材长廊和狼头节等。此外，镇上还活跃着许多派别，包括 \"羽毛守护者\"（Keepers of the Feather）和 \"奥西布斯\"（Osybus）的牧师（见本章后面的\"{@book Travelers in the Mists|VRGR|3|Keepers of the Feather} \"和\"{@book Other Groups|VRGR|3|Priests of Osybus}\"）。",
	"Lying in the shadow of Castle Ravenloft, the village of Barovia is oppressed by fear. The villagers rarely venture from their homes, suspecting their neighbors of wickedness and fearing evils are taking root in the shadows. Their fears are largely justified, as ghosts and vampire spawn haunt the town, and many locals have been consumed by their own callousness or wicked temptations. A rare exception to the village's cold desperation can be found at the local tavern called the Blood of the Vine. Those few who would oppose Strahd's evil congregate here—and are in turn spied upon by the count's agents.": "躺在Ravenloft城堡的阴影下，Barovia村被恐惧所压制。村民们很少冒险离开他们的家，怀疑他们的邻居是邪恶的，担心邪恶在阴影中生根。他们的恐惧在很大程度上是合理的，因为鬼魂和吸血鬼的后代在镇上出没，许多当地人都被自己的冷酷无情或邪恶的诱惑所吞噬。在当地一家名为 \"藤之血 \"的酒馆里，可以看到村子里冷漠绝望的一个罕见例外。少数反对斯特拉赫特邪恶的人聚集在这里，反过来又被伯爵的代理人监视。",
	"Once a haven of virtuous wizards, the Amber Temple was long ago corrupted by evil. It was here that Strahd made his pact with the Dark Powers to become a vampire, with the blessing of the lich Exethanter. While the lich remains, albeit as a mere shadow of its former self, the true evil within the Amber Temple lies within its collection of amber sarcophagi. These monoliths hold vestiges of dead, hateful gods—beings that aspire to re-create past depravities and manipulate mortals to fulfill unspeakable agendas. Various evil forces set their intentions upon the Amber Temple, viewing it as a nexus of secrets underpinning the nature of the Domains of Dread. The {@book priests of Osybus|VRGR|3|Priests of Osybus} (detailed in the \"{@book Other Groups|VRGR|3|Other Groups}\" section later in this chapter) have particular interest in this site.": "琥珀圣殿曾经是善良的巫师们的天堂，但很久以前就被邪恶所侵蚀。正是在这里，斯特拉赫特与黑暗势力签订了契约，在巫师埃克塞坦特的祝福下成为了吸血鬼。虽然巫师还在，但它只是以前的一个影子，琥珀寺的真正邪恶在于它的琥珀石棺收藏。这些石碑保存着死去的、可恨的神灵的遗迹，他们渴望重新创造过去的罪恶，并操纵凡人来实现不可告人的议程。各种邪恶势力把他们的意图放在琥珀神庙上，把它看作是支撑恐惧之域本质的秘密的纽带。{@book priests of Osybus|VRGR|3|Priests of Osybus}（详见本章后面的\"{@book Other Groups|VRGR|3|Other Groups} \"部分）对这个地方特别感兴趣。",
	"In life, Count Strahd von Zarovich was a ruthlessly effective conqueror. Over decades of brutal military campaigning, he defeated his rivals and forged a nation. Retiring from war, Strahd settled in the beautiful valley where he'd won his greatest victory. There, in the way of his ancestors, he spilled his blood into the earth, sealing a pact between himself and the land. In honor of his parents, King Barov and Queen Ravenovia, he named the valley Barovia and constructed his fortress-home, Castle Ravenloft.": "在生活中，斯特拉赫特-冯-扎罗维奇伯爵是一个无情的有效征服者。在数十年的残酷军事行动中，他击败了对手，建立了一个国家。从战争中退役后，斯特拉赫特在他取得最大胜利的美丽山谷中定居。在那里，他按照祖先的方式，将自己的鲜血洒向大地，在自己和这片土地之间签订了契约。为了纪念他的父母Barov国王和Ravenovia女王，他将山谷命名为Barovia，并建造了他的堡垒--Ravenloft城堡。",
	"Strahd had spent his youth at war fighting alongside Ulmed, the founder of the Ulmist Inquisition, but as he reached his middle years he sought the comforts of family. He invited his kin to live with him at Castle Ravenloft, and was eventually joined by his younger brother, Sergei.": "斯特拉特年轻时曾在战争中与乌尔姆斯特宗教裁判所的创始人乌尔姆特并肩作战，但当他步入中年后，便开始寻求家庭的慰藉。他邀请自己的亲属与他一起住在雷文洛夫特城堡，最终他的弟弟谢尔盖也加入其中。",
	"Sergei was everything Strahd wasn't—youthful, empathic, and warm. Soon after he arrived in Barovia, the younger von Zarovich and a local villager named Tatyana fell in love. Strahd resented his brother, even more so after meeting Tatyana and experiencing her pure kindness. Obsessing over her, Strahd sought to woo Tatyana but was soundly rebuffed. Unwilling to accept her wishes or Sergei as his better, Strahd delved into the sinister secrets of his land and came to learn of the Amber Temple. There, amid hidden lore and the imprisoned vestiges of ancient evil, Strahd first encountered the Dark Powers—and made a bargain with them to regain his vitality and ensnare Tatyana's heart.": "谢尔盖拥有斯特拉赫特所没有的一切--年轻、富于同情心和热情。在他到达巴罗维亚后不久，年轻的冯-扎罗维奇和一位名叫塔季扬娜的当地村民相爱了。斯特拉特对他的兄弟心怀怨恨，在见到塔季扬娜并感受到她的纯真善良后，更是如此。由于迷恋她，斯特拉赫特试图向塔季扬娜求爱，但遭到了她的强烈反对。由于不愿意接受她的愿望，也不愿意接受谢尔盖成为他的好朋友，斯特拉赫特深入研究了他的土地上的险恶秘密，并了解到了琥珀寺。在那里，在隐藏的传说和古代邪恶的遗迹中，斯特拉赫特第一次遇到了黑暗势力，并与他们进行了交易，以恢复他的生命力并俘获塔季扬娜的心。",
	"The day of Sergei and Tatyana's wedding, Strahd murdered Sergei and, to seal his pact with the Dark Powers, drank his brother's blood. He revealed his new might to Tatyana, expecting to enthrall her. Instead, horrified by Sergei's murder, Tatyana fled Strahd, ultimately leaping from the height of Castle Ravenloft to escape him and vanishing into the Mists. At the same time, traitors from among the castle's guards and wedding's guests rose up to assassinate Strahd. Despite suffering countless wounds, Strahd did not die. The nature of his bargain with the Dark Powers was revealed, and Strahd became the multiverse's first vampire. A night of bloody rage followed, and when dawn touched the parapets of Castle Ravenloft, no living soul survived within. But Strahd remained.": "在谢尔盖和塔季扬娜的婚礼上，斯特拉赫特谋杀了谢尔盖，并喝下了他兄弟的血，以确定他与黑暗势力的契约。他向塔蒂亚娜展示了他的新力量，希望能让她着迷。相反，由于对谢尔盖的谋杀感到恐惧，塔季扬娜逃离了斯特拉赫特，最终从雷文洛夫特城堡的高处跳下，逃离了他，并消失在迷雾中。与此同时，城堡的守卫和婚礼的宾客中的叛徒也起来刺杀斯特拉赫特。尽管受了无数的伤，但斯特拉赫特并没有死。他与黑暗势力的交易性质被揭露，斯特拉赫特成为多元宇宙的第一个吸血鬼。一夜的血腥愤怒之后，当黎明触及雷文洛夫特城堡的护栏时，里面已经没有活人了。但斯特拉赫特仍然存在。",
	"Little is known of the origins of the Domains of Dread, but what's certain is that they began here. Strahd's villainy, his connection to his land, and his entanglement with the sinister {@creature Priest of Osybus|VRGR|priests of Osybus} (detailed in {@book chapter 5|VRGR|5|Priests of Osybus}) drew all of Barovia into the Shadowfell. This began a succession of torments that haunt the Count still and spill forth to drag others into the Land of the Mists.": "人们对恐惧之域的起源知之甚少，但可以肯定的是，它们始于此。斯特拉特的恶行，他与他的土地的联系，以及他与阴险的{@creature Priest of Osybus|VRGR|priests of Osybus}(详见{@book chapter 5|VRGR|5|Priests of Osybus})的纠葛，把整个巴罗维亚都卷入了阴影之城。这开始了一连串的折磨，这些折磨仍然困扰着伯爵，并将其他人拖入迷雾之地。",
	"Strahd is a patient and dramatic mastermind. His statistics are similar to those of a {@creature vampire} and his spellcasting prowess is formidable, enabling him to face most threats directly. Strahd ever seeks to escape his boredom and draws challenges out for as long as it entertains him. However, if insulted, the Darklord can turn all of Barovia against his foes.": "斯特拉特是一个有耐心和戏剧性的策划者。他的统计数据与{@creature vampire}相似，他的法术能力非常强大，使他能够直接面对大多数威胁。斯特拉特一直在寻求摆脱无聊的生活，只要能让他高兴，他就会把挑战引向深入。然而，如果受到侮辱，黑魔王可以让整个巴罗维亚的人都来对付他的敌人。",
	"Strahd is bound to Barovia and it to him in a way few rulers or Darklords understand. As part of this relationship, Strahd knows when any creature enters or dies violently within Barovia—and takes personal offense when his agents or the domain's wolves are slain. Strahd can also manifest a variety of dramatic effects, such as causing his voice to be heard on the wind, making his visage appear in the clouds, changing the weather, and so forth. He can't use these effects to aid him in combat, but they can make his presence known throughout the land.": "斯特拉特与巴罗维亚的关系，以及巴罗维亚与他的关系，很少有统治者或黑暗领主能理解。作为这种关系的一部分，斯特拉赫特知道任何生物进入巴罗维亚或在巴罗维亚内暴毙--当他的代理人或该地区的狼被杀时，他就会感到愤怒。斯特拉特还能表现出各种戏剧性的效果，比如让他的声音在风中传出，让他的面孔出现在云中，改变天气等等。他不能用这些效果来帮助他作战，但它们可以让他的存在在整个土地上被人所知。",
	"Strahd eagerly plays the parts of nobleman and gracious host, but drops these pretenses when they no longer serve him, revealing his megalomania and monstrous nature. Strahd believes he has no peers and eagerly cultivates servants, particularly vampire spawn. He hasn't survived for ages by being reckless, though, and he retreats or sacrifices even his favorite agents when necessary.": "斯特拉特热衷于扮演贵族和亲切的主人的角色，但当这些角色不再为他服务时，他就会放弃这些伪装，暴露出他的自大狂和怪异的本性。斯特拉特认为自己没有同龄人，热衷于培养仆人，尤其是吸血鬼的后代。不过，他并不是靠鲁莽行事就能活到现在的，必要时他甚至会撤退或牺牲他最喜欢的特工。",
	"The ancient Vistani fortune-teller Madame Eva makes her home in Barovia.

Ultimately, only the bravest lay siege to the castle or accept the count's invitations to visit him there. But Castle Ravenloft needn't be challenged in a single assault, and defeating Strahd might not be the only goal of those who enter. The library, chapel, and catacombs of Castle Ravenloft all hold tempting secrets that might be vital to countering the count's plots or undoing other evils.

Ultimately, though, the weight of the elder brain's deeds caused its own physicality to rebel, giving rise to an alien disease that began devouring its fleshy form. Horrified by an affliction that infected only them, the other elder brains united and psionically expelled the diseased brain from existence.": "总结一个时代的暴行，一个长老大脑的现实弯曲研究有一个意想不到的结果，向它揭示了一个恶性的真相，而这个真相的存在是没有准备的。在这一新兴启示的引导下，长老的大脑转向并捕食它的同龄人，吞噬他们的发现和他们的身体形式，为不可能的神化提供动力。但最终，长老大脑的行为的重量导致了它自己的身体的反叛，产生了一种开始吞噬它的肉体形式的外来疾病。其他长老的大脑被一种只感染他们的疾病吓坏了，他们联合起来，用幻术将患病的大脑驱逐出世。",

Mobility between country and town is a luxury of the wealthy, making horses and coaches symbols of prestige.": "大多数博尔卡人生活在贵族地主统治下的小型农业社区，或生活在莱希贝格、列夫卡雷斯特或斯图本等较大的定居点的贫困之中。贵族们在国家的森林或起伏的山丘中保留着乡村住宅，与普通的乌合之众相距甚远。在乡村和城市之间的流动是富人的奢侈品，使马匹和马车成为威望的象征。",
	"Borca's capital stands at the pinnacle of culture and power. Unpopular members of the noble families squabble in the halls of the People's Parliament, the land's ineffective seat of government. The true rulers of the nation conduct business in the offices of faceless mercantile ventures and the back rooms of avant-garde clubs. The commoners of Levkarest glimpse this world of toxic glamor only from afar, or when nobles exploit street-level fads.": "博尔卡的首都站在文化和权力的顶峰。不受欢迎的贵族家族成员在人民议会的大厅里争吵不休，这是这片土地上无效的政府所在地。国家的真正统治者在不露面的商业企业的办公室和前卫俱乐部的密室中进行交易。Levkarest的平民只有从远处才能瞥见这个有毒的魅力世界，或者当贵族们利用街头的时尚时。",
	"Remarkably, when the town of Ilvin burned, no lives were lost. Rather than rebuilding, the seven hundred survivors moved their homes a few miles east and founded New Ilvin. This sleepy community seems ordinary in every way, but residents avoid speaking of Old Ilvin and never return, going so far as to pave a new road to avoid the burned-out ruins.": "值得注意的是，当伊尔文镇被烧毁时，没有人丧生。七百名幸存者没有进行重建，而是将他们的家向东移了几英里，建立了新伊尔文。这个沉睡的社区似乎在各方面都很普通，但居民们避免谈论旧伊尔文镇，而且再也不回来了，甚至还铺设了一条新路以避开被烧毁的废墟。",
	"Long considered Levkarest's unfashionable shadow, the city of Sturben has become a haven for those seeking distance from the domain's elite. To counter the half-hearted justice doled out by local nobles, the city council of Sturben reinstituted a severe court system from Borca's past, where anyone can bring and argue cases before five masked judges. The judges who hear cases at the Faceless Court change, but their masks remain the same: grimly ornate visages inspired by Borca's mysterious first inhabitants. The court sends iron-masked circuit judges into the surrounding lands to execute justice. For especially contentious cases, judges imprison all involved and drag them to Sturben to face trial.": "长期以来，斯特本市被认为是Levkarest的不时髦的影子，已经成为那些寻求与该领域的精英保持距离的人的天堂。为了对抗当地贵族的半心半意的正义，斯特本市议会恢复了博尔卡过去的严厉法庭制度，任何人都可以在五个戴面具的法官面前提起诉讼并进行辩论。在无脸法院审理案件的法官会发生变化，但他们的面具却保持不变：严峻华丽的面孔，灵感来自博尔卡的神秘的第一批居民。法院派戴着铁面具的巡回法官到周围的土地上执行正义。对于特别有争议的案件，法官会监禁所有涉案人员，并将他们拖到斯图本接受审判。",
	"Each of the domain's prominent families maintains an opulent and extravagantly named manor, as noted on the Noble Families and Estates table. Following the custom of Borcan high society, each family is expected to host at least two formal balls, banquets, or other extravagances annually. These events provide the setting for intrigues, politics, business arrangements, seductions, embarrassments, and social warfare. (See the \"{@book Nobles of Borca|VRGR|3|Nobles of Borca}\" section for more on these families.)": "正如贵族家庭和庄园表上所指出的那样，该领地的每一个著名家族都拥有一座富丽堂皇、名目繁多的庄园。按照博尔坎上流社会的惯例，每个家族每年至少要举办两次正式的舞会、宴会或其他奢侈活动。这些活动为阴谋、政治、商业安排、引诱、尴尬和社会战争提供了环境。(关于这些家庭的更多信息，请参见\"{@book Nobles of Borca|VRGR|3|Nobles of Borca} \"部分）。",
	"Among the most decadent noble holdings is Misericordia, the Boritsi estate. Situated amid miles of fields, greenhouses, and alchemy labs used to create exceptional Boritsi-branded perfumes and tinctures, the manor features multiple widow's walks and more than three hundred rooms. An awe-inspiring array of unique plants grows within the estate's private conservatory wings. The distillates from these plants furnish the lady of the house, Ivana Boritsi, with a room-sized perfume organ—along with a hidden, parallel collection of remarkable poisons.": "在最颓废的贵族财产中，Misericordia是Boritsi的庄园。该庄园位于数英里长的田地、温室和炼金实验室之中，用于制造特殊的Boritsi品牌的香水和酊剂，该庄园有多条寡妇通道和三百多个房间。在庄园的私人温室里，生长着一系列令人敬畏的独特植物。这些植物的蒸馏物为女主人Ivana Boritsi提供了一个房间大小的香水器官--以及一个隐藏的、平行的非凡毒药收藏。",

Their homes occupy opposite ends of the domain, and their interests rarely overlap—that is, until suitably intriguing characters arrive.": "伊万娜-鲍里西和伊万-迪利斯尼亚是鲍尔卡的共同统治者。由于他们同时在同一片土地上犯下了堕落的罪行，黑暗势力将他们两人都集中到了恐惧之域。不过，一般来说，伊万娜和伊万彼此之间没有什么关系。他们的家占据了领域的两端，他们的兴趣也很少重叠--也就是说，直到有适当的有趣的人物到来。",
	"Ivana and Ivan are opposite sides of the same tarnished coin. Ivana fought for all she has and now loathes it; Ivan was given everything and believes he was denied what he deserves. Ivana is forced into society; Ivan thirsts for attention.

	"Although your adventures might focus on either Darklord, Borca presents the opportunity to explore multiple facets of arrogance, selfishness, and obsession. The characters might become the objects of both Darklords' interests. This could put them at the center of a rivalry between the two or provide them with the unique opportunity to leverage one Darklord's power against another. An adventure in Borca doesn't have to involve a conflict between its two Darklords, but if it does, consider putting the party at the center of it.": "虽然你的冒险可能集中在任何一个黑暗领主身上，但博尔卡提供了探索傲慢、自私和痴迷等多个方面的机会。人物可能会成为两个黑暗领主的兴趣对象。这可能使他们处于两个人之间竞争的中心，或者为他们提供独特的机会，利用一个黑暗领主的力量来对付另一个。在博尔卡的冒险不一定要涉及两个黑暗领主之间的冲突，但如果有的话，可以考虑让当事人处于冲突的中心。",
	"The firstborn of the fantastically wealthy Boritsi aristocrats, Ivana was clever, poised, and—in her father Klaus's eyes—utterly unfit to lead their family. Unwilling to accept her father's view, Ivana spent her youth eschewing the dalliances of her kin, instead learning every aspect of her family's business in perfumes and medicinal herbs. Her mother, Camille, encouraged her daughter and tried to ensure that Ivana would one day lead the family.": "伊万娜是富可敌国的Boritsi贵族的长子，她聪明、有风度，在她父亲克劳斯眼中，完全不适合领导他们的家庭。由于不愿意接受她父亲的观点，伊万娜在年轻时就避开了她的亲属的暧昧关系，而是学习她家族的香水和药草业务的各个方面。她的母亲卡米尔鼓励她的女儿，并试图确保伊万娜有一天会领导这个家庭。",
	"Ivana's focus on her goals faltered when she met Pieter, a skilled chemist in the family's service. From him, Ivana learned alchemy and the perfumer's art, and the two grew close. Camille recognized Ivana's budding romance and saw the lowborn Pieter as a threat to Ivana's prospects. Camille thus seduced the young man and arranged for Ivana to discover them, intent on convincing her daughter to forsake this and all future romances.": "当她遇到为家族服务的熟练化学家彼得（Pieter）时，她对自己目标的关注有所动摇。从他那里，伊凡娜学会了炼金术和调香师的艺术，两人的关系也越来越好。卡米尔认识到伊凡娜正在萌芽的爱情，并将出身低微的皮特视为对伊凡娜前景的威胁。因此，卡米尔勾引了这个年轻人，并安排伊凡娜发现他们，打算说服她的女儿放弃这个和所有未来的浪漫。",
	"Ivana took a different lesson from the experience. Realizing the depths of her family's corruption, she poisoned her mother and her callous brothers, with the goal of forcing Klaus to name her his heir. Creating and employing a series of aromatic toxins, she watched her siblings and treacherous mother sicken and die. None suspected her involvement.": "伊凡娜从这次经历中得到了不同的教训。意识到她的家庭腐败的深度，她毒死了她的母亲和她冷酷无情的兄弟，目的是迫使克劳斯指定她为继承人。她创造并使用了一系列芳香的毒素，看着她的兄弟姐妹和奸诈的母亲生病和死亡。没有人怀疑她的参与。",
	"On Ivana's eighteenth birthday, the aged and ailing Klaus summoned her to his office to share a momentous decision. Having lost his sons, Klaus named Ivana's cousin, Ivan Dilisnya, his heir. He had already announced his decision to the estate staff and sent a messenger to inform the Dilisnyas.": "在伊万娜的18岁生日那天，年老体衰的克劳斯把她叫到办公室，分享一个重要的决定。由于失去了儿子，克劳斯指定伊万娜的表弟伊万-迪利斯尼亚为他的继承人。他已经向庄园的工作人员宣布了他的决定，并派出一名信使通知迪利斯尼亚家族。",
	"Ivana only laughed as a toxic mist poured across the Boritsi estate. Having expected her father's pettiness, she had manufactured a disaster that turned all the estate's perfume into poison. Drinking the antidote, Ivana watched as Klaus and all the manor's workers and inhabitants died choking amid a violet fog. By the time the poison cleared, the land of Borca had become surrounded by the Mists.": "伊万娜只是笑了笑，因为一团有毒的雾气涌遍了鲍里西庄园。由于预料到她父亲的小气，她制造了一场灾难，把庄园里所有的香水都变成了毒药。喝下解毒剂后，伊凡娜看着克劳斯和庄园里所有的工人和居民在紫色的雾气中窒息死亡。当毒药清除的时候，博尔卡的土地已经被迷雾包围。",
	"By spending one uninterrupted hour within her laboratory at the Boritsi Estate, Ivana can create ten doses of any poison or re-create the effect of one wizard spell of 7th level or lower.

See \"{@book Intrigue in Borca|VRGR|3|Intrigue in Borca}\" later in this section for details on how Ivana uses alchemy in her manipulations.": "只要在她位于Boritsi庄园的实验室里不间断地待上一个小时，Ivana就可以制造出10个剂量的任何毒药，或者重新创造出一个7级或更低级的巫师法术的效果。她随时都有各种毒药在手。参见本节后面的\"{@book Intrigue in Borca|VRGR|3|Intrigue in Borca}\"，以了解伊凡娜如何使用炼金术进行操纵的细节。",
	"Ivana's genius and cynicism, in combination with the Dark Powers' aid, grant her insight into the nature of Borca's people that borders on precognition. She's always one step ahead of her rivals and has prepared the perfect situation, stand-in, or poison accordingly. However, Ivana has a facile understanding of true love and companionship, so those who behave in an unexpectedly selfless manner might undermine her elaborate contingencies.": "伊凡娜的天才和愤世嫉俗，再加上黑暗势力的帮助，使她对博尔卡人的本质有了近乎预知的洞察力。她总是比她的对手领先一步，并相应地准备了完美的情况、替身或毒药。然而，伊凡娜对真爱和伴侣关系的理解很肤浅，所以那些表现得出乎意料的无私的人可能会破坏她精心设计的应急措施。",
	"Ivana delights in her gardens, both the exotic conservatories within the Boritsi Estate and the flower fields surrounding her manor. She has created innumerable unique plants, as well as plant creatures with strange abilities and unflagging loyalty to her.": "伊凡娜以她的花园为乐，包括波里茨庄园内的异国情调的温室和她庄园周围的花田。她创造了无数独特的植物，以及具有奇怪能力的植物生物，并对她忠心不二。",

	"Ivana conquered her rivals, yet still suffers. The following circumstances endlessly torment the Darklord:": "伊凡娜征服了她的对手，但仍在遭受痛苦。以下情况无休止地折磨着黑暗君主。",
	"Ivana has not aged since the Mists claimed Borca, and her youthful appearance leads many to underestimate her.": "伊凡娜自迷雾中宣称的博尔卡以来一直没有变老，她年轻的外表导致许多人低估了她。",
	"Ivana rules her family's business and political empire brilliantly. Despite this, she is endlessly doubted and second guessed. Many believe she is a typical, vacant noble youth or the puppet of her elder cousin, Ivan Dilisnya.": "伊万娜出色地统治着她家族的商业和政治帝国。尽管如此，她还是受到无尽的怀疑和猜测。许多人认为她是一个典型的、空虚的贵族青年，或者是她的大表哥伊万-迪利斯尼亚的傀儡。",
	"Ivana's genius and refinement lead her to grow swiftly bored of most potential allies and rivals. She ever seeks her equal in intellect and ambition, and she is ever disappointed. Maintaining her family's vast array of social expectations is especially tedious.": "伊凡娜的天才和精致使她对大多数潜在的盟友和对手迅速感到厌烦。她一直在寻求在智力和野心方面与她相当的人，但她总是感到失望。维持她的家庭的大量社会期望是特别乏味的。",
	"Ivana never found her father's will and knows that should it fall into the wrong hands, her depraved cousin Ivan could claim all she's earned. She'll do anything to prevent this.": "伊凡娜从未找到她父亲的遗嘱，她知道如果遗嘱落入坏人之手，她堕落的表弟伊凡可能会索取她所赚取的一切。她将不惜一切代价来阻止这一切。",
	"Ivana Boritsi's exceptional mind and remarkable senses of hearing, taste, and smell inform her elevated fancies and expansive knowledge of art, food, fashion, social protocols, alchemy, and perfume. Few people can hold her attention, and none can redeem themselves in her eyes from even a moment's boorishness.": "Ivana Boritsi的非凡头脑和非凡的听觉、味觉和嗅觉，使她对艺术、食物、时尚、社会礼仪、炼金术和香水有了更高的幻想和广博的知识。很少有人能吸引她的注意力，在她眼里，没有人能够从哪怕是片刻的粗野中赎回自己。",

	"Ages later, the siblings Boris and Camille Dilisnya each plotted to steal the prestige of their cousins, the Boritsis. Camille manipulated her way into the Boritsi family while Boris prepared his son Ivan to be the new head of a united Boritsi–Dilisnya line. Despite abundant opportunities to excel, Ivan grew to embody childish vice and impulsiveness, with his family's wealth and doting servants exacerbating these whims. Frequent \"accidents\" transpired around Ivan, forcing his family to cover up the maimings and deaths of numerous pets and servants. Only Ivan's sister, Kristina, was exempt from his bullying and wicked tricks.": "几百年后，鲍里斯和卡米尔-迪利斯尼亚兄妹各自谋划着窃取他们的表兄弟鲍里西家族的声望。卡米尔操纵她的方式进入鲍里奇家族，而鲍里奇则准备让他的儿子伊万成为统一的鲍里奇-迪利斯尼亚家族的新首脑。尽管有很多机会出人头地，但伊万却逐渐体现出幼稚的恶习和冲动，而他家的财富和宠爱的仆人又加剧了这些奇思妙想。伊万身边经常发生 \"事故\"，迫使他的家人掩盖了许多宠物和仆人的伤残和死亡。只有伊万的妹妹克里斯蒂娜可以免受他的欺凌和恶作剧的影响。",
	"Over time, Kristina proved precocious and eager to learn. Ivan, however, became stubbornly obsessed with childish toys and behaviors. He encouraged his sister to indulge his idealized visions of their childhood, going so far as to affect childlike behaviors and ways of speaking. Although his family members grew increasingly unsettled, they sheltered the future head of their house, reshaping their estate and investing in whimsical diversions for him.": "随着时间的推移，克里斯蒂娜证明了她的早熟和对学习的渴望。然而，伊万却顽固地迷恋上了幼稚的玩具和行为。他鼓励妹妹沉迷于他对他们童年的理想化想象，甚至影响到孩子的行为和说话方式。尽管他的家人越来越不放心，但他们还是庇护了这个未来的一家之主，为他重塑了他们的财产，并投资于异想天开的娱乐活动。",
	"On the night Ivana Boritsi poisoned her family, Ivan learned of his parents' intention to send Kristina to a prestigious boarding school. Screams, cruel cackling, and clockwork screeching filled the Dilisnya estate that night. When it ended, Ivan was the last living member of the Dilisnya family, and the Mists closed in around Borca.": "在伊万娜-鲍里西毒死家人的那个晚上，伊万得知他的父母打算把克里斯蒂娜送到一所著名的寄宿学校。那天晚上，尖叫声、残忍的咯咯声和钟表的刺耳声充满了迪利斯尼亚庄园。当它结束时，伊万是迪利斯尼亚家族最后一个活着的成员，而迷雾则在博尔卡周围合拢。",
	"One of Ivan's favorite manipulations is using his letters and his high-pitched voice to pretend to be a lonely youngster. Ivan keeps out of sight from those he targets for deception so they don't realize the discordance between his childlike affectations and his appearance. If forced to reveal his aged form, he pretends to be confused and employs elaborate clockwork toys, disguises, and conveyances that further mask his true ability.": "伊万最喜欢的手法之一是利用他的信件和他高亢的声音来假装成一个孤独的年轻人。伊万一直躲在他的欺骗对象的视线之外，这样他们就不会意识到他的孩子气和他的外表之间的不协调。如果被迫暴露出他年老的形态，他就会假装糊涂，并采用精心制作的发条玩具、伪装和运输工具，进一步掩盖他的真实能力。",
	"The Dark Powers provide Ivan with any toy he desires. Creatures of many sorts serve Ivan, and any of them, from maids to monstrous guardians, could be clockwork devices or stuffed toys.

	"The Dilisnya estate, Degravo, is a confusing tangle of topiary gardens, hedge mazes, and neglected petting zoos that abut sheer cliffs. The mansion lies at the heart of the estate, and is divided into multiple structures, including the Laughing House, a playhouse where life-sized toys enact brutal operas, and Ivan's Playroom, a wing dedicated to the master of the estate's clockwork tinkering and private decadences.

Additionally, the fog is filled with Ivan's taunting voice and patrolled by grim clockwork toys.": "伊万每天可以关闭或打开博尔卡的边界一次。他关闭边界是为了防止他所迷恋的人逃跑。当他关闭博尔卡的边界时，迷雾就会上升，详见本章开头的\"{@book The Mists|VRGR|3|The Mists} \"部分。此外，雾中充满了伊万嘲弄的声音，并有狰狞的发条玩具在巡逻。",

	"Ivan demands to be the center of attention while remaining deeply suspicious of the world beyond Degravo.

Ivan delights in his guests' discomfort and in forcing them to entertain him.": "伊万要求成为关注的焦点，同时对德格拉沃以外的世界保持着深深的怀疑。他的家人都不在了，他哄骗客人到他家，让他们沉浸在美妙的颓废和他令人讨厌的、幼稚的奇思妙想的不正常混合体中。伊万以客人的不适为乐，强迫他们为他服务。",

	"The Carnival deals in fabricated spectacles and cheap surprises, but it disguises actual marvels of a far deadlier sort. Even as the Carnival's troupers astonish their visitors with amazing performances, a surreal world of outlandish beings, dangerous bargains, and deadly tricks encroaches on the festivities, threatening performers and audiences alike. The Carnival provides a safe place for a time, but the longer it lingers, the greater the danger grows—whether from intolerant common folk, jaded troupers, dangerous fey, or {@creature Isolde|VRGR}'s tireless quest.": "嘉年华会上演的是虚假的表演和廉价的惊喜，但它掩盖了更致命的实际奇迹。即使狂欢节的演员们用惊人的表演让游客们大吃一惊，一个由怪异的生物、危险的交易和致命的技巧组成的超现实世界也在侵袭着节日，威胁着表演者和观众们。狂欢节为人们提供了一个安全的场所，但时间越长，危险就越大--无论是来自不宽容的普通人、厌倦的剧团、危险的精灵，还是{@creature Isolde|VRGR}的不懈追求。",

	"Once the prison of the lich Azalin Rex, Darkon stretched between two oceans, its lands filled with gothic cities and the monuments of forgotten wizard-tyrants. Largely ignoring his role as ruler, Azalin dwelled in seclusion while manufacturing magical atrocities and manipulating prophecies to free himself from the Dark Powers' grip.

	"In the minds of Darkon's people, Castle Avernus was the sanctuary of their aloof king and the citadel from which he watched over his people.

	"Despite the devastation, Castle Avernus isn't empty.

Cut off from ports elsewhere in the domain, Il Aluk's nobles cling to lies of prosperity while their fortunes dwindle. They have passed their suffering on to their servants, forcing the populace into poverty and inciting a swell of a violence ranging from riots to assassinations.

	"The foggy port of Martira Bay is no stranger to mystery. A center of trade, the city receives regular visits from eerie vessels from mysterious lands. The oddities these ships bring make Martirans indifferent to miraculous sights.

At night, though, the Mists surrounding the domain turn deadly and encroach on the land—sometimes by infinitesimal degrees, other times in unstoppable floods. The fates of those claimed by these surges is a mystery. If a character experiments with the Shroud, a taste of this threat can take the form of damage, stress (see \"{@variantrule Fear and Stress|VRGR}\" in {@book chapter 4|VRGR|4}), or a glimpse of the deadly forces lurking beyond. Don't outright slay characters who encounter the Shroud, but make sure the experience reinforces the threat to all of Darkon.": "白天，黑暗之城周围的迷雾可以正常穿越，允许生物在黑暗之城本身的领域或区域之间旅行。但到了晚上，领域周围的迷雾就会变成致命的，并侵占土地--有时是无限小的程度，有时则是不可阻挡的洪水。那些被这些浪潮夺去生命的人的命运是个谜。如果一个角色用裹尸布做实验，他就会尝到这种威胁的滋味，包括伤害、压力（见{@book chapter 4|VRGR|4}中的\"{@variantrule Fear and Stress|VRGR}\"），或者瞥见潜伏在外面的致命的力量。不要直接杀死遇到裹尸布的角色，但要确保这种经历能加强对整个黑暗城的威胁。",

Everything appears more valuable, more solid, and more wholesome than the actuality, and everyone behaves as if the illusion of grandeur and prosperity were real.": "Dementlieu的领地由Port-a-Lucine市组成，它包括Pernault湾和Lucine湾的阴暗水域，以及城市周围雾气笼罩的郊区的变幻无常的碎片。卢西恩港是一个腐败和衰败的溃烂泥潭，隐藏在颓废财富的闪亮外表之下。一切都显得比实际情况更有价值、更坚实、更健康，每个人的行为都好像宏伟和繁荣的假象是真的一样。",

The poorest citizens struggle to maintain a middle-class appearance, scrounging through garbage heaps at night to find wares to sell in their shops in the morning. The members of the true middle class pretend to be titled aristocracy, but they wear much-patched and mended clothes, and starve for a week to host a ball that barely passes as lavish—by recycling table scraps into mysterious pâtés and cleverly disguised dumplings. The real aristocracy of the domain exists solely in its Darklord, Duchess d'Honaire.": "在Dementlieu，每个人都在为生活而流汗，但承认现实意味着社会的毁灭。最贫穷的市民努力维持中产阶级的外表，晚上在垃圾堆里翻找东西，以便早上在商店里出售。真正的中产阶级成员假装是有头有脸的贵族，但他们穿着打了很多补丁的衣服，饿了一个星期，通过把餐桌上的残羹剩饭变成神秘的肉酱和巧妙伪装的饺子，来举办一个勉强算得上是奢华的舞会。这个领地真正的贵族只存在于它的黑暗领主D'Honaire公爵夫人。",

	"The Mother of Tears Cathedral is the most honest place in Dementlieu. Dedicated to the god Ezra, the cathedral's teachings put greater emphasis on weeping for the horrors of the world than on taking any action to cure or combat them. The clergy resists acknowledging any kind of distinction of class or rank among the worshipers, despite the stark stratification of society outside the cathedral's walls. All people are desperate wretches in the merciful hands of Ezra, who mourns for and with them all. A magnificent alabaster statue of Ezra, her sword and shield set aside as she weeps into her hands, adorns the sanctuary.": "眼泪之母大教堂是Dementlieu最诚实的地方。大教堂供奉以斯拉神，它的教义更强调为世界的恐怖而哭泣，而不是采取任何行动来治愈或打击它们。神职人员拒绝承认崇拜者之间有任何形式的阶级或等级区别，尽管大教堂墙外的社会分层很明显。在以斯拉的仁慈之手，所有人都是绝望的可怜虫，他为他们所有人感到悲哀。一座宏伟的雪花石膏雕像装饰着圣殿，她的剑和盾牌被放在一边，她对着自己的手哭泣。",

	"A harder blow descended when Saidra's stepmother casually mentioned the death of a duke who ruled nearby. Saidra asked if this duke was her father's wicked brother, and if his demise meant her father could reclaim his title. Her stepmother and stepsisters laughed at her, and her father admitted the truth. He had been only a servant in the duke's household and fled when he was caught trying to steal silver from the kitchen.": "当Saidra的继母随口提到一个在附近统治的公爵的死亡时，一个更严重的打击降临了。赛义德拉问这个公爵是否是她父亲的邪恶兄弟，以及他的死亡是否意味着她父亲可以重新获得他的头衔。她的继母和继姐妹嘲笑她，而她的父亲则承认了事实。他只是公爵家里的一个仆人，当他试图从厨房里偷银子时被抓到了，他就逃走了。",
	"Saidra refused to accept this bitter truth. Fleeing the house, she went to her mother's grave and begged the departed spirit to aid her. A kind, grandmotherly figure appeared and granted Saidra's wish, bestowing on her a magnificent gown and fine jewels to attend the masquerade ball that celebrated the coronation of the new duke. Saidra rode to the ball in a stately conjured carriage, determined to kill the duke and claim his title.": "Saidra拒绝接受这个痛苦的事实。逃出家门后，她来到母亲的墓前，乞求逝去的灵魂帮助她。一个慈祥的祖母般的人物出现了，并满足了Saidra的愿望，赐予她一件华丽的礼服和精美的珠宝，让她参加庆祝新公爵加冕的化妆舞会。Saidra坐着一辆庄严的魔法马车去参加舞会，决心杀死公爵并夺取他的头衔。",

Saidra began to contemplate an alternative to murdering the duke: she could marry the poor fool and become the duchess she'd always believed herself to be.": "在舞会上，Saidra周围的魅力使她对公爵无法抗拒，他们一起跳了几个小时的舞。Saidra开始考虑谋杀公爵的替代方案：她可以嫁给这个可怜的傻瓜，成为她一直认为自己是的公爵夫人。",
	"But as the clock struck midnight, terror stalked the ball as guests started rapidly sickening and dying. The plague afflicted the duke and Saidra as well. As they lay dying in each other's arms, the duke gasped a fateful confession: he was not the son of the late duke, but of a servant in the duke's household. The duke, unable to have children of his own, claimed the servant's infant son and raised him. Later, that servant was caught stealing from the kitchen and fled the house with his young daughter.": "但当午夜钟声敲响时，恐怖笼罩了整个舞会，因为客人开始迅速生病和死亡。瘟疫也折磨着公爵和Saidra。当他们躺在对方的怀里奄奄一息时，公爵喘着粗气说出了一个决定性的事实：他不是已故公爵的儿子，而是公爵家的一个仆人的儿子。公爵无法拥有自己的孩子，就认领了这个仆人的幼子并将其抚养长大。后来，那个仆人在厨房偷东西时被抓，带着他的小女儿逃离了房子。",
	"Enraged to discover this \"duke\" was no more a real duke than her father—and worse, that he was her brother, Saidra drew her blade and drove it into the pretender's heart.

	"Saidra's form is a vaporous as her claims to nobility. She's a crimson spirit with statistics similar to a {@creature wraith}.

Called \"sentries of death,\" these trees inspire grim stories suggesting that their wood is haunted or their roots reach into the realm of the dead. In contrast, a ring of pale sentry trees stands in the depths of the Vigila Forest. Tales tell that none who enter the ring survive. The zombie plague seems to offer proof of their truth: few undead emerge from the forest, and those that do are entirely skeletonized.": "高耸的黑色落叶树刺穿了法尔科夫尼亚茂密而低语的森林的树冠。这些树被称为 \"死亡的哨兵\"，它们激发了严峻的故事，表明它们的木头是闹鬼的，或者它们的根伸向了死神的领域。与此相反，在维吉拉森林的深处有一圈苍白的哨兵树。传说中，进入这个环的人无一幸存。僵尸瘟疫似乎证明了它们的真实性：很少有亡灵从森林中走出来，而那些走出来的亡灵则完全是骷髅头。",
	"In the world of her birth, Vladeska Drakov was known as the Crimson Falcon, leader of a peerless mercenary army called the Falcon's Talons. She and her troops executed a thousand ancient grudges and petty atrocities in a land of bitterly feuding royal families. Infamous but respected, Drakov amassed a fortune and planned to retire young, buying a title and a realm to rule.": "在她出生的世界里，弗拉德斯卡-德拉科夫被称为深红猎鹰，是一支名为猎鹰之爪的无敌雇佣军的领袖。她和她的部队在这片充满怨恨的王室土地上执行了无数古老的怨恨和琐碎的暴行。德拉科夫声名狼藉但受人尊敬，他积累了一笔财富，并计划在年轻时退休，购买一个头衔和一个王国来统治。",
	"The sacking of Yeivere changed her plans. During that city's razing, Drakov's mercenaries went a step too far. The Falcon's Talons killed a unique soul during their slaughter. None can say who the soul was—a prince, a saint, a witch, an angel—but with its death, the world turned against them.": "对耶维尔的洗劫改变了她的计划。在那座城市被夷为平地的过程中，德拉科夫的雇佣兵们走得太远了。猎鹰之爪在他们的屠杀中杀死了一个独特的灵魂。没有人能够说清楚这个灵魂是谁--一个王子、一个圣人、一个女巫、一个天使--但是随着它的死亡，这个世界开始反对他们。",
	"The ruling families united to hunt the Talons. Thanks to her tactical genius, Drakov repelled her pursuers and went on the offensive. One by one she attacked her former benefactors, burning villages, pressing citizens into service, and impaling anyone with a drop of noble blood. Though it took years, Drakov forged a bloody empire. But while sacking the burning city of her last remaining foe, Drakov and her troops were engulfed by strange smoke. When it cleared, everything they knew was gone.": "统治家族联合起来追捕塔龙人。多亏了她的战术天才，德拉科夫击退了她的追兵，并展开了攻势。她一个接一个地攻击她以前的恩人，烧毁村庄，强迫公民服役，并将任何有一滴贵族血的人刺死。虽然花了很多年，德拉科夫还是建立了一个血腥的帝国。但是，当德拉科夫和她的部队在洗劫她最后一个敌人的燃烧中的城市时，被奇怪的烟雾吞噬了。当烟雾散去时，他们所知道的一切都消失了。",
	"Transported to an unfamiliar land, Drakov and her troops wasted little time subjugating it. The realm fell quickly, even easily, and upon taking the city of Lekar, Drakov prepared to name herself ruler of her new empire: Falkovnia.": "德拉科夫和她的部队被运送到一个陌生的土地上，没有浪费多少时间就征服了它。这个王国很快就沦陷了，甚至很容易，在占领莱卡城后，德拉科夫准备将自己命名为她的新帝国的统治者。法尔科夫尼亚。",
	"Then, under a moonless sky, the dead rose against the land's invaders. The surrounding villages fell to the zombies with hardly a sound, and undead claws scraped Lekar's walls before the first alarms were raised. The First Siege of Lekar raged for four days. Drakov's strategies, both brilliant and desperate, eventually turned back the zombie horde, but at the cost of most of her veteran troops.": "然后，在一个没有月亮的天空下，死者起来反抗土地的入侵者。周围的村庄几乎无声无息地倒在了僵尸手里，在第一次警报响起之前，亡灵的爪子就已经刮过了莱卡的墙壁。对莱卡的第一次围攻持续了四天。德拉科夫的策略，既聪明又绝望，最终逆转了僵尸群，但却牺牲了她大部分的老兵。",
	"Since then, Drakov has lost nearly her entire nation. Every month a new desperate battle unfolds. She prepares ceaselessly for each, certain of her plans and ultimate victory, but doubting the mettle of her troops. With threats and public, impalings she tries to keep her people more terrified of her than of the undead. And with every new moon she faces an unconquerable foe, never revealing to anyone that each zombie bears the familiar, rotting face of an innocent her soldiers once put to the sword.": "从那时起，德拉科夫几乎失去了整个国家。每个月都有一场新的绝望的战斗展开。她不停地为每一场战斗做准备，确信她的计划和最终的胜利，但怀疑她的部队的能力。她通过威胁和公开刺杀，试图让她的人民对她的恐惧超过对亡灵的恐惧。每一个新月，她都要面对一个不可战胜的敌人，她从不向任何人透露，每一个僵尸都有一张熟悉的、腐烂的脸，是她的士兵们曾经用剑刺死的无辜者。",
	"Vladeska's military forces are both completely overwhelming and entirely outnumbered. As an occupying force, the Talons are terrifying. Their numbers are relatively few, but they're organized enough to oppress Lekar's ragged survivors and enforce Drakov's totalitarian laws. In the face of zombie hordes, though, they're fighting a losing battle against foes whose numbers only grow. And every time a Talon falls, Lekar's final defeat grows closer. Talon soldiers use the {@creature guard} stat block, while commanders are {@creature Veteran||veterans}.": "弗拉德斯卡的军事力量既是完全压倒性的，又是完全寡不敌众的。作为一支占领军，塔隆人是可怕的。他们的人数相对较少，但他们有足够的组织性来压迫莱卡的衣衫褴褛的幸存者，并执行德拉科夫的极权主义法律。然而，面对僵尸群，他们正在与数量只增不减的敌人进行一场失败的战斗。每当一个塔伦人倒下，莱卡的最终失败就越来越近。塔伦士兵使用{@creature guard}状态块，而指挥官是{@creature Veteran||veterans}。",
	"Lekar—and, to an extent, all of Falkovnia—is a martial dictatorship. Drakov's troops carry out example-setting impalings as punishment for even the slightest crimes.

	"Unlike most Darklords, Vladeska Drakov can't open her domain's borders, so Falkovnia's borders are usually closed. Anyone who enters the Mists surrounding Falkovnia encounters an endless number of zombies. Even if travelers somehow avoid these shambling corpses, they emerge from the Mists back in Falkovnia, pursued by an undead mob. For one week every month, though, following the night of the new moon, the Mists surrounding Falkovnia are empty of zombies and the borders open. During this time, Drakov sends patrols of Talons to sweep the edges of the Mists for deserters. These patrols are difficult to avoid and battles with them often attract zombies.": "与大多数黑暗领主不同，弗拉德斯卡-德拉科夫不能打开她领地的边界，所以法尔科夫尼亚的边界通常是封闭的。任何进入法尔科夫尼亚周围的迷雾的人都会遇到无尽的僵尸。即使旅行者以某种方式避开这些摇摇欲坠的尸体，他们也会从迷雾中走出来，回到法尔科夫尼亚，被亡灵暴徒追赶。不过，每个月有一个星期，在新月之夜之后，法尔科夫尼亚周围的迷雾中没有僵尸，边界开放。在这段时间里，德拉科夫派出 \"爪牙 \"巡逻队，在迷雾的边缘扫荡逃兵。这些巡逻队很难避开，与他们的战斗往往会吸引僵尸。",

She believes a foe from her past is responsible for the endless zombie attacks and quietly looks for trustworthy agents to find the zombies' source.": "弗拉德斯卡-德拉科夫坚毅而凶狠，她把软弱视为软弱，不喜欢被浪费时间。她重视冷酷的能力，毫不留情地做出生死攸关的决定。她的孤立和统治的压力对她来说是沉重的，但每天的灾难使她专注于国家的需要而不是她的失败。她相信她过去的一个敌人要对无休止的僵尸攻击负责，并悄悄地寻找值得信赖的特工来找到僵尸的来源。",

	"On the day of the ritual that would consecrate the pharaoh's connection with the gods, Ankhtepot rallied his loyal priests and murdered their liege. He had misjudged the peoples' loyalty, though, and they rose up and executed the traitorous priests.": "在为法老与诸神的联系举行仪式的那一天，安克特波特召集了他忠诚的祭司，谋杀了他们的主子。但他错误地估计了人民的忠诚度，他们起义并处决了叛徒祭司。",
	"Moreover, Ankhtepot had misjudged the will of his gods. As he stood before them in death, the immortals forsook him, cursing him and denying him entry to the afterlife. Instead, they returned him to the world, but stripped away a piece of his soul, his ka—the vital essence that inspires all living beings.": "此外，安克特波特误判了他的神的意志。当他死后站在他们面前时，神仙们抛弃了他，诅咒他并拒绝他进入来世。相反，他们把他送回了世界，但剥夺了他的一部分灵魂，他的ka--激励所有生物的重要本质。",
	"Ankhtepot reawakened, trapped and paralyzed within his corpse as he was mummified along with his treacherous followers.

Granted new freedom by the Dark Powers, Ankhtepot emerged from his crypt into the domain of Har'Akir.": "无数年过去了，但在安克特波特的名字从他的家乡消失的最后一天，一个声音闯入了牧师的监狱，问他是否仍然觉得自己有资格统治。历经沧桑，安克特波特的傲慢并没有减弱，他肯定地回答。黑暗势力给予了他新的自由，安克特波特从他的墓穴中走出来，进入了哈克尔的领域。",
	"In this new land, Ankhtepot found a pious people devoted to the same gods he once served. Immediately he set to wiping out that religion, replacing it with new gods of his own imagining, false divinities for whom he alone spoke. Using blasphemous rites, Ankhtepot resurrected the priests once buried alongside him as powerful mummies, replacing their heads with those of beasts holy to his new faith. These Children of Ankhtepot served him as they did in life, and together the dead conquered the souls of Har'Akir.": "在这块新的土地上，安赫特波特发现有一群虔诚的人，致力于他曾经服务的那些神灵。他立即着手消灭这种宗教，用他自己想象的新神取代它，这些假神只有他自己能说话。安赫特波特利用亵渎神明的仪式，将曾经与他并肩埋葬的祭司复活为强大的木乃伊，用那些对他的新信仰来说是神圣的野兽的头取代他们的头。这些安克特波特的孩子们像他们生前一样为他服务，死者一起征服了哈克尔的灵魂。",
	"The ages have marched ever on. Ankhtepot has known treachery and conquest. He has known divinity and rule. But now he knows only boredom and despair. His sole remaining desire is to recover his lost ka, which he knows remains somewhere in Har'Akir. With it, he hopes to become mortal again, die, and face his original gods' judgment once more. Whether this means peace or oblivion is meaningless to him.

	"Although Ankhtepot cares nothing for fragile, short-lived mortals, he has a tyrant's obsession with order and knows the living might be useful in finding his lost ka. To that end, he relies on his priests to maintain peace in Har'Akir and provide for the people. Should the populace grow discontent, Ankhtepot expects the priests to deal with discord swiftly. If they can't, he sends his mummy servants to indiscriminately quell any uprising. Examples of such massacres fill Har'Akir's history, but they are known only to the domain's priests.": "虽然Ankhtepot对脆弱、短命的凡人不屑一顾，但他对秩序有一种暴君式的迷恋，知道活着的人可能对寻找他丢失的卡有用。为此，他依靠他的牧师来维持Har'Akir的和平并为人民提供服务。如果民众越来越不满，安克特波特希望祭司们能迅速处理好不和。如果他们做不到，他就派他的木乃伊仆人不分青红皂白地镇压任何起义。这种屠杀的例子充斥着Har'Akir的历史，但只有该地区的祭司们知道。",
	"The priests of Har'Akir's gods work Ankhtepot's will. Most priests believe themselves to be devout servants of the gods, having no idea that their deities are false. They keep alert for strangers and omens, reporting them to their superiors and, ultimately, High Priestess Isu Rehkotep. The high priestess dutifully watches for signs of a mysterious treasure her pharaoh seeks and orders any strangers in Har'Akir brought to her at the Temple of Ese, but she also relishes her influence and decadent lifestyle. She dreads the day Ankhtepot blames her for not finding what he desires, though she has no idea she's searching for the Darklord's ka.": "Har'Akir诸神的祭司执行安克特波特的意志。大多数祭司认为自己是诸神的虔诚仆人，不知道他们的神灵是假的。他们对陌生人和预兆保持警惕，向他们的上级报告，最终向大祭司Isu Rehkotep报告。大祭司尽职尽责地观察她的法老所寻求的神秘宝藏的迹象，并命令将任何在哈克尔的陌生人带到她的埃塞神庙，但她也享受她的影响力和颓废的生活方式。她害怕有一天Ankhtepot会因为没有找到他想要的东西而责怪她，尽管她不知道她在寻找黑暗领主的卡。",
	"When Ankhtepot wishes to close the borders of Har'Akir, mighty sandstorms rise at the edges of the domain.

	"The Dark Powers torment Ankhtepot in one simple, all-encompassing way: they won't let him die. Existence is pain for the pharaoh. He vividly remembers every one of his crimes and understands that his ambitions have sustained his corporeal form for untold lifetimes. He seeks his ka and rebirth as a mortal not to prolong his existence, but so his life might finally end.": "黑暗势力以一种简单的、包罗万象的方式折磨着安克特波特：他们不让他死。对法老来说，存在就是痛苦。他清楚地记得自己的每一项罪行，并明白他的野心使他的肉体形态维持了无数个生命。他寻求他的死亡和重生成为一个凡人，不是为了延长他的存在，而是为了让他的生命最终结束。",
	"Ankhtepot is seen only a few times a year, when his priests bring offerings to Pharaoh's Rest and beseech him for the gods' empty blessings. Those who glimpse the pharaoh describe a withered corpse clad in black linen wrappings and gold adornments, with a voice like sand ground between clashing mountains. The only time he bothers with either the living or the dead is when they actively offend him (such as by trespassing upon his solitude at Pharaoh's Rest), when they bring him hope of finding his ever-elusive ka, or when disappointment kindles his rage.": "安赫特波特每年只出现几次，当他的祭司把祭品带到法老的休息处，恳求他的神灵空降保佑。那些瞥见法老的人描述说，他是一具身着黑色亚麻布包裹和金色装饰的枯萎的尸体，声音就像山峰间的沙地。他唯一与活人或死人打交道的时候，是他们主动冒犯他的时候（比如闯入他在法老之所的独处），是他们给他带来找到他永远无法找到的卡的希望的时候，或者是失望点燃他愤怒的时候。",

This domain is less a nation than a vast magical laboratory, whose wizard overlord Hazlik views every being as either an apprentice or a test subject. He conscripts those he acknowledges as lesser wizards into performing elaborate magical experiments, twisting the fabric of magic and reality until it frays. These experiments endlessly scar a domain drained of vitality, tortured by magical disasters, and overrun with abominations. The greatest wounds affect the invisible flows of magic underpinning the land, turning it erratic and dangerous.": "在哈兹兰，魔法是权威，是任何过度行为的理由，而对于那些没有魔法的人来说，则是不可避免的厄运的阴影。这个领域与其说是一个国家，不如说是一个巨大的魔法实验室，其巫师霸主哈兹利克将每个人都视为学徒或试验品。他征召那些他认为是小巫师的人进行精心设计的魔法实验，扭曲魔法和现实的结构，直到它崩溃。这些实验无休止地伤害着一个被耗尽生命力的领域，被魔法灾难折磨，被可憎的东西所淹没。最大的创伤影响了支撑这片土地的无形的魔法流，使其变得不稳定和危险。",

He watches as common folk cower at the passage of his ostentatious apprentices. He watches as monstrosities birthed from strange experiments prowl openly.

And he watches every new magical innovation, eager to claim it and add the discovery to his list of glorious achievements.": "尽管这个领域存在着魔法危险，但法术精英们的野心却与日俱增，胆子越来越大。哈兹利克既偏执又有控制欲，他通过 \"哈兹利克之眼 \"观察着他的下属们的计划。这个无处不在的眼形符号标志着建筑、装饰品、服装和个人，通过这双眼睛，黑暗君主看到了一切。他看着普通人在他那浮夸的学徒面前畏缩不前。他看着从奇怪的实验中孕育出来的怪物公开地游荡。他看着毒地深处贪婪的虫子爬到地表寻找食物。他注视着每一个新的魔法创新，急切地想要得到它，并将这一发现添加到他的光荣成就列表中。",

	"Thick, sparkling smog chokes the village of Ramulai. The nearby mines yield a host of rare elements useful in magical experimentation, and Hazlik's apprentices have constructed numerous alchemical refineries and dangerous laboratories in Ramulai to take advantage of this resource. The waste from these industries fills the Burning River, named for the regularity with which the pollutants within it ignite, causing the waters to burn with colored flames. These toxins sicken the people of Ramulai, cause transformations among the regional wildlife, and created the swampland known as the Brew.": "浓厚的、闪闪发光的烟雾扼住了拉穆莱村的喉咙。附近的矿场出产大量对魔法实验有用的稀有元素，哈兹利克的学徒们在拉穆莱建造了许多炼金厂和危险的实验室来利用这一资源。这些工业产生的废物填满了燃烧河，因为河中的污染物经常被点燃，导致河水被彩色的火焰燃烧而得名。这些毒素使拉穆莱的人们生病，导致该地区的野生动物发生变化，并创造了被称为 \"Brew \"的沼泽地。",
	"Hazlik's apprentices live in Sly-Var, a settlement composed of a collection of laboratories. Spellcasters obsessed with earning the Darklord's favor raise architecturally discordant towers that defy physical laws by floating, being accessible only by magic, or being larger on the inside than the outside. The town's residents magically create whatever they need, resulting in little need for trade. This leaves the labyrinthine streets and knotted bridges between intertwined compounds eerily empty. Common folk often disappear among these streets, the victims of magical guardians, escaped test subjects, or wizards who see the magically deficient as stock for their experiments.": "哈兹利克的学徒们住在斯利瓦尔（Sly-Var），这是一个由一系列实验室组成的定居点。痴迷于赢得黑暗领主青睐的施法者们建造了建筑风格不和谐的塔楼，这些塔楼违反了物理法则，可以漂浮，只能通过魔法进入，或者内部比外部更大。镇上的居民用魔法创造他们需要的东西，因此几乎不需要贸易。这使得迷宫般的街道和交织在一起的大院之间的结成的桥梁变得异常空旷。普通人经常在这些街道上消失，他们是魔法守护者的受害者，逃跑的试验品，或者将魔法缺陷者视为实验品的巫师。",
	"The largest town in Hazlan spreads along the canyon floor where the slow, iridescent waters of the Alterity River and the Strangers' Tears meet. Toyalis boasts a population of poor but hardworking common folk united by their shared pursuit of prosperity and terror of the domain's magic-using elite.

	"Several times each season, one of Hazlik's apprentices leads a procession of attendants and magical wonders to Toyalis in search of replacement servants, new apprentices, or stock for magical experiments. A carnival atmosphere ensues, with this apprentice displaying their magical accomplishments and setting up competitions to assess the locals. These contests involve tests of magical ingenuity, strangely themed talent shows, and open brawls. When the mage's procession leaves, it takes townsfolk deemed valuable with it.": "每个季节都会有几次，哈兹利克的一个学徒带领着一队随从和魔法奇迹来到托亚利斯，寻找替代的仆人、新学徒或用于魔法实验的储备。随之而来的是狂欢的气氛，这个学徒展示他们的魔法成就，并设立比赛来评估当地人。这些比赛涉及魔法智慧的测试，主题奇怪的才艺表演，以及公开的争吵。当法师的队伍离开时，它带走了被认为有价值的镇民。",

The fog has since spread, extending in tendrils toward sources of powerful magic throughout the domain. Originally, the Lacuna reached exclusively toward Veneficus and the Mound of the Worm. Since then, Hazlik's apprentices have placed sprawling magical sigils upon the land, runes that slowed the Lacuna's growth but split its development in multiple directions.": "拉库纳的蒸气与该地区边界的迷雾相同。哈兹兰的人们知道Lacuna曾经比较小，它是由一场魔法灾难造成的。此后，雾气蔓延开来，向整个领域的强大魔法来源延伸。最初，雾气只向维尼菲克斯（Veneficus）和 \"虫冢 \"延伸。从那时起，哈兹利克的学徒们在这片土地上放置了大量的魔法符文，这些符文减缓了拉库纳的成长，但却将它的发展分成了多个方向。",

Although the palace features impressive audience chambers and decadent pleasure gardens, Hazlik rarely welcomes guests. Only his most accomplished apprentices attend him with any regularity. Apprentices who displease him never return from the Darklord's palace. Left to his solitude, Hazlik spends days at a time within his personal meditation chambers, avoiding sleep and using the Eyes of Hazlik throughout the domain to search for useful magic—and to identify any who might be acting against him.": "哈兹利克的红塔宫殿矗立在名为 \"红山 \"的锯齿状山丘之上。黑暗领主独自居住在这里，由一群奴役性的建筑和魔法造物组成的工作人员负责照料。虽然宫殿里有令人印象深刻的觐见室和颓废的娱乐花园，但哈兹利克很少欢迎客人。只有他最有成就的学徒才会定期来拜访他。那些让他不高兴的学徒们永远不会从黑暗领主的宫殿里回来。哈兹利克独来独往，在他的个人冥想室里一待就是好几天，他避免睡觉，用哈兹利克之眼在整个领域内搜寻有用的魔法，并识别任何可能与他作对的人。",

	"As Hazlik advanced in power, he developed rivalries with his fellow Red Wizards. Through petty contests, victories, and embarrassments, he grew increasingly arrogant, orchestrating events that left his rivals scarred by his spells or their own backfiring magic. During these feuds, there was one competitor Hazlik was unable to defeat: the Red Wizard Indreficus. Hazlik gradually came to fixate on Indreficus as his true rival. Indreficus shared Hazlik's genius and arrogance, and they spent many seasons as vicious adversaries and passionate lovers. They drove one another to feats of magical brilliance both revolutionary and unspeakable. For a time, the two ambitious wizards knew a wicked peace.": "随着哈兹利克实力的提升，他与其他红袍巫师产生了竞争关系。通过琐碎的竞赛、胜利和尴尬，他变得越来越傲慢，策划的事件让他的对手因他的法术或他们自己的魔法而留下伤痕。在这些争斗中，有一个竞争者哈兹利克无法战胜：红袍巫师因德雷菲克斯。哈兹利克逐渐把印德雷菲克斯当作自己真正的对手。英德雷菲克斯与哈兹利克有着同样的天才和傲慢，他们在许多季节里既是凶恶的对手又是热情的恋人。他们互相驱使，创造了革命性的、难以言喻的魔法辉煌。有一段时间，这两个雄心勃勃的巫师知道了一种邪恶的和平。",
	"That ended when Hazlik discovered that Indreficus had gained the attention of the land's ruling zulkirs and planned to betray Hazlik to garner their favor.

	"Instead, the zulkirs revealed that Indreficus had not betrayed him. Rather, the zulkirs had watched the pair's ascent and, wary of their potential, sought to undermine them before they became threats. Moreover, they deemed Hazlik's transformation of Indreficus an abomination. As punishment, they ruled that every rival Hazlik had defeated could exact a penance of their choosing upon him. But even as the first brand-wielding member of the mob of Hazlik's scarred rivals approached to take their revenge, Hazlik fled through the groaning portal that had been Indreficus.": "相反，Zulkirs透露，Indreficus并没有背叛他。相反，祖尔基尔人目睹了这对夫妇的崛起，并对他们的潜力保持警惕，试图在他们成为威胁之前破坏他们。此外，他们认为哈兹利克对英德雷菲克斯的改造是一种可憎的行为。作为惩罚，他们规定，每一个被哈兹利克打败的对手都可以对他进行他们所选择的忏悔。但是，就在哈兹利克那群伤痕累累的对手中第一个挥舞着烙印的人走过来报仇的时候，哈兹利克却从曾经的印德雷菲克斯的呻吟声中逃了出来。",
	"To his surprise, Hazlik emerged in a grim netherworld of fog and hateful visions where Indreficus's condemning voice hounded him mercilessly. Eventually, he escaped those nightmare lands into a realm that knew nothing of magic. He had changed, becoming covered in golden tattoos evocative of symbols that meant \"traitor\" in his homeland. Undaunted, Hazlik claimed the title of zulkir and dubbed his new world Hazlan.": "令他惊讶的是，哈兹利克出现在一个充满浓雾和可憎幻象的阴间，在那里，英德雷菲克斯谴责的声音无情地纠缠着他。最终，他逃出了那些噩梦般的国度，进入了一个对魔法一无所知的领域。他变了，身上布满了金色的纹身，这在他的家乡意味着 \"叛徒 \"的符号。哈兹利克毫不畏惧，声称自己是祖尔基尔（zulkir），并将他的新世界命名为哈兹兰。",
	"At any given time, Hazlik permits dozens of apprentices to study at his feet. His lessons are infrequent, demanding, and filled with mocking examples. Those who don't impress him don't survive long. He encourages rivalries among his students and drives them to push the boundaries of magical possibilities. His goading results in magical wonders, failed experiments, and the magical disasters that plague the land. Hazlik claims his apprentices' successes as his own, both to hide his lack of innovation and to further his reputation as Hazlan's greatest wizard.

The result is a realm where supernatural disasters wrack the land and magic turns against the characters, forcing them to doubt abilities they previously took for granted.

	"Eventually, Chiang could deny her revenge no longer. Among her mentor's records, she had learned of a bell that could make its ringer's dreams come true—but creating the bell required the scale of a gold dragon. Knowing her mentor would never provide a scale, Chiang drugged the dragon with a rare herb, planning to steal a small scale while he slept. But in her haste, she mixed the herbal concoction poorly. The dragon's body and everything nearby rapidly aged and decayed, killing her benefactor and destroying a hoard filled with ages of treasures and wisdom. Chiang's home had been destroyed again, but a single golden scale remained. Using the scale, Chiang constructed the Nightingale Bell and dragged it into her occupied city. Tolling it, she wished for a city devoid of invaders—and instantly they vanished.": "最终，蒋介石再也无法否认她的复仇。在她导师的记录中，她了解到有一个钟可以让敲钟的人梦想成真--但制造这个钟需要金龙的鳞片。蒋介石知道她的导师不会提供龙鳞，就用一种罕见的草药给龙下了药，打算趁他睡觉时偷出一小块龙鳞。但在匆忙中，她将草药混合得很差。龙的身体和附近的一切都迅速老化和腐烂，杀死了她的恩人，并摧毁了一个充满古老的宝藏和智慧的囤积物。蒋介石的家又被毁了，但仍有一片金鳞。蒋介石用这块鳞片建造了夜莺钟，并把它拖到她占领的城市。敲响它，她希望一个没有入侵者的城市--而入侵者立刻就消失了。",
	"Awed and delighted, the nation executed the few invaders lingering outside the city and made Tsien Chiang their queen. Chiang ruled for years, enacting vast reforms and strict but sensible laws in pursuit of creating the perfect empire. She had a family, taking particular pride in her four beloved daughters.": "全国人民感到震惊和高兴，处决了在城外徘徊的少数入侵者，并让蒋介石成为他们的女王。蒋介石执政多年，颁布了大量的改革措施和严格但合理的法律，以追求建立一个完美的帝国。她有一个家庭，对她的四个心爱的女儿感到特别自豪。",
	"As the memory of Chiang's past victories faded, her people grew frustrated with the queen's stern laws and demanding orders. Though her capital had become a radiant center of learning and art, the citizens revolted. Chiang acted swiftly to quell the uprising with numerous executions, yet the revolution grew. Everything she had wished for fell into flames. She showed no mercy to the rebels, ordering her armies to kill the families of all insurrectionists. In response, assassins struck Tsien Chiang's palace. Although she survived, her family did not.": "随着对蒋介石过去胜利的记忆逐渐消失，她的人民对女王严厉的法律和苛刻的命令越来越感到失望。尽管她的首都已经成为一个光芒四射的学习和艺术中心，但市民们还是起义了。蒋介石迅速采取行动，以大量处决来平息起义，但革命仍在发展。她所希望的一切都落入了火坑。她对叛军毫不留情，命令她的军队杀死所有叛乱分子的家人。作为回应，刺客们袭击了蒋介石的宫殿。虽然她活了下来，但她的家人却没有。",
	"Distraught, Chiang climbed to the highest tower of her palace, looked out over her burning dreams, and struck the Nightingale Bell. Rather than granting her vengeful wish, the bell cracked and spilled a golden mist across the land. When the mist cleared, Tsien Chiang's perfect city was gone, replaced by the unreal prison-city of I'Cath.": "蒋介石心烦意乱，爬上她宫殿的最高塔，看着她燃烧的梦想，敲响了夜莺钟。钟声并没有实现她的复仇愿望，而是裂开了，一股金色的雾气洒满了整个大地。当迷雾散去时，慈禧的完美城市消失了，取而代之的是虚幻的监狱城市I'Cath。",
	"Tsien Chiang's statistics are similar to those of a {@creature mage} with access to a variety of magic items—her favorite being an ornate robe that functions similarly to a {@item Heward's handy haversack} and {@item wings of flying}.

As her city moves with brilliant efficiency, Chiang luxuriates with perfect dream versions of her lost daughters.": "蒋锡培的神奇创造--夜莺钟，和她一起来到了I'Cath。在城市重生后不久，蒋介石用这口破钟为她的完美城市许愿。相反，她的愿望创造了一个持久的梦境，占据了所有在I'Cath睡觉的人的梦。在这个梦中，蒋子贤的每个计划都被完美地执行。当她的城市以辉煌的效率前进时，蒋子欣与她失去的女儿们的完美梦境一起享受。",

	"Ramya refused to yield. Moving swiftly, she organized her allies, met her brother in battle, and captured him. She intended to execute Arijani, but her sister Reeva counseled her to be merciful. Ultimately, Ramya forgave the rebel faction, Arijani was imprisoned, and Ramya ascended as Kalakeri's maharani, Queen of Kings.": "拉米亚拒绝屈服。她迅速行动，组织了她的盟友，在战斗中与她的兄弟相遇，并抓住了他。她打算处决阿里贾尼，但她的妹妹里瓦劝她手下留情。最终，拉米亚原谅了反叛派，阿里贾尼被监禁，拉米亚登上了卡拉凯里的马哈拉尼，即国王的女王。",
	"A golden period in Kalakeri's history followed as Ramya promoted learning and upheld justice. Meanwhile, Reeva secretly coordinated with Ramya's foes. After years of resentment and plotting, the rebels freed Arijani and spurred nobles across the nation into open revolt.": "随着拉姆亚促进学习和维护正义，卡拉凯里的历史进入了一个黄金时期。与此同时，里瓦与拉米亚的敌人秘密协调。经过多年的怨恨和谋划，叛军释放了阿里贾尼，并刺激全国的贵族们公开造反。",
	"The resulting conflict swiftly turned vicious. Regretting her past mercy, Ramya captured enemy ranas and executed them using flame and ravenous tigers, while her loyalists put anyone suspected of treason to the sword. The maharani's brutality increased distrust in her rule, and the fighting spread.": "由此引发的冲突迅速变成了恶性事件。拉米亚对自己过去的仁慈感到后悔，她抓住了敌人的拉纳人，用火焰和贪婪的老虎处决了他们，而她的忠诚者则把任何被怀疑叛国的人送上了剑。玛哈拉尼的残暴行为增加了人们对她的统治的不信任，战斗也随之蔓延。",
	"After numerous battles, Reeva begged her sister to meet her brother and negotiate an end to the war. Ramya, who remained ignorant of Reeva's part in freeing Arijani, trusted her sister—and walked straight into their trap.": "经过无数次的战斗，丽娃恳求她的妹妹去见她的哥哥，并就结束战争进行谈判。拉米亚对里瓦在释放阿里贾尼方面的作用一无所知，她相信了她的姐姐，并直接走进了他们的陷阱。",
	"Ambushers slaughtered Ramya's royal guards and captured the maharani. In the central courtyard of the Cerulean Citadel, Arijani sentenced his sister to death. As the court strangler's garrote crushed her windpipe, Ramya cursed her brother and sister, calling them bloodthirsty beasts. Arijani and Reeva denied their sister the honors befitting a maharani, dumping Ramya's corpse into the sea. As they did, a terrible monsoon struck the Harvest Peninsula, bringing with it walls of supernatural mist that closed around Kalakeri.": "伏击者屠杀了拉米亚的皇家卫队，并抓住了玛哈拉尼。在塞鲁利亚城堡的中央庭院里，阿里贾尼宣判了他妹妹的死刑。当宫廷扼杀者的绞索压碎她的气管时，拉姆亚诅咒她的哥哥和姐姐，称他们是嗜血的野兽。Arijani和Reeva拒绝给予他们的妹妹与玛哈拉尼相称的荣誉，把Ramya的尸体扔进了大海。就在他们这样做的时候，一场可怕的季风袭击了丰收半岛，带来了超自然的雾墙，包围了卡拉凯里。",
	"The storm lashed Kalakeri for weeks, and when it reached its height, Ramya emerged from her watery grave. Reborn with terrifying power, she called upon those who had been slaughtered in her service. Loyal in death, a corpse legion joined the revitalized maharani. They stalked the streets of Jadurai, tore down the gates of the Cerulean Citadel, and slaughtered those who had betrayed Ramya. They dragged Arijani and Reeva into the courtyard where their sister died, and there Ramya declared them traitors. The treacherous pair clawed and howled like beasts as undead elephants crushed them to death. Their wails of terror left Ramya unmoved.": "风暴袭击了卡拉凯里数周，当它达到顶峰时，拉米亚从她的水牢里走了出来。她以可怕的力量重生，号召那些为她服务而被屠杀的人。在死亡中的忠诚，一个尸体军团加入了复兴的玛哈拉尼。他们漫步在贾杜里的街道上，拆毁了塞鲁利亚城堡的大门，并屠杀了那些背叛拉米亚的人。他们把阿里贾尼和里瓦拖进了他们姐姐死去的院子里，在那里拉米亚宣布他们为叛徒。这对背叛者像野兽一样张牙舞爪地嚎叫着，不死的大象把他们压死了。他们恐怖的哀嚎让拉姆亚无动于衷。",
	"Arijani and Reeva's plots didn't end with their lives, however. They too were reborn, transformed into fiends with animalistic features by their souls' ravenous desires. And so the conflict gripping Kalakeri continues, trapping the nation in an endless war and forcing its people to swear loyalty to monsters.": "然而，阿里贾尼和里瓦的阴谋并没有随着他们的生命结束。他们也得到了重生，被他们灵魂的贪婪欲望转化为具有动物特征的恶魔。就这样，笼罩着卡拉凯里的冲突仍在继续，将这个国家困在无休止的战争中，迫使它的人民向怪物宣誓效忠。",
	"Reborn as a {@creature death knight}, Ramya desperately tries to hold on to or retake the Sapphire Throne in a cycle of victory and loss with her equally uncompromising siblings. Although an illusion disguises her deathless state, Ramya constantly feels the chill in her bones and her own crumbling flesh. Her existence has becomes one of constant struggle, doubt, and defeat as her obsessions shape all of Kalakeri.": "重生为{@creature death knight}，拉米亚拼命地试图守住或夺回蓝宝石王座，与她同样不妥协的兄弟姐妹们进行胜利和失败的循环。虽然幻觉掩盖了她的死亡状态，但拉米亚不断地感受到她骨子里的寒意和她自己崩溃的肉体。她的存在已经成为一个不断挣扎、怀疑和失败的过程，因为她的执着塑造了整个卡拉凯里。",
	"Ramya eagerly leads her troops in battle. She rides into combat upon a war {@creature elephant} or {@creature wyvern} and carries the legendary talwar (longsword) and longbow of the Vasavadan dynasty's founder. The Vasavadan coat of arms, a golden wyvern clutching a white lotus in its talons, emblazons her armor and that of her soldiers.": "拉米亚热切地带领她的部队作战。她骑着战马{@creature elephant}或{@creature wyvern}投入战斗，并携带瓦萨瓦丹王朝创始人的传奇长剑(talwar)和长弓。瓦萨瓦丹的纹章是一只金色的狼牙棒，爪子里抓着一朵白莲花，印在她和她的士兵们的盔甲上。",
	"Ramya demands loyalty from her subjects. She and her soldiers kill anyone who she considers a traitor, a status extended not only to those who back Arijani and Reeva, but even to those who don't support her vociferously enough. Her paranoia makes her ruthless, leading her to slaughter countless innocents.": "拉姆亚要求她的臣民效忠。她和她的士兵杀死任何她认为是叛徒的人，这种地位不仅延伸到那些支持阿里扎尼和里瓦的人，而且甚至延伸到那些没有足够大声支持她的人。她的偏执使她变得冷酷无情，导致她屠杀了无数的无辜者。",
	"Kalakeri's armies and the guards of the Cerulean Citadel obey Ramya without question, despite thousands of them having died in her service. These soldiers' loyalty follows them into death. Any living soldier who dies in Ramya's service returns to life as an Undead warrior—a {@creature skeleton} or {@creature wight}—on the night of the next new moon and rejoins the maharani's army. Ramya's living followers consider this deathless state an honor and the ultimate mark of loyalty.": "Kalakeri的军队和Cerulean城堡的守卫毫不犹豫地服从Ramya，尽管他们中的数千人已经为她服务而死。这些士兵的忠诚度跟随他们进入死亡。任何为拉姆雅服务而死的活人士兵都会在下一个新月的夜晚以亡灵战士的身份复活--{@creature skeleton}或{@creature wight}--并重新加入玛哈拉尼的军队。拉姆亚的生前追随者认为这种不死状态是一种荣誉，是忠诚的最终标志。",
	"Ramya never compromises with her siblings Arijani and Reeva. She constantly struggles to quell the rebellion they lead, as detailed in \"{@book Treachery in Kalakeri|VRGR|3|Treachery in Kalakeri}\" later in this domain.": "拉米亚从不向她的兄弟姐妹阿里贾尼和里瓦妥协。她不断努力平息他们所领导的叛乱，正如本领域后面的\"{@book Treachery in Kalakeri|VRGR|3|Treachery in Kalakeri} \"中所详述的那样。",
	"Ramya can close or open Kalakeri's borders as detailed in \"{@book The Mists|VRGR|3|The Mists}\" at the start of this chapter, but she can do so only while she controls the Sapphire Throne.

	"The Dark Powers endlessly conspire to confound Ramya, most persistently in the following ways:": "黑暗势力无休止地密谋迷惑拉米亚，最持久的方式是以下几点。",
	"Ramya's treacherous siblings, Arijani and Reeva, endlessly contest her reign and sow discord across Kalakeri. Ramya both loathes and loves her siblings, so despite their perpetual deceptions, she remains vulnerable to their promises and lies.": "拉米亚背信弃义的兄弟姐妹，阿里贾尼和里瓦，无休止地争夺她的统治权，并在整个卡拉凯里播下不和谐的种子。拉米亚既厌恶又爱她的兄弟姐妹，所以尽管他们一直在欺骗，她仍然容易受到他们的承诺和谎言的影响。",
	"Ramya can manipulate her domain and control its borders only while she controls the Sapphire Throne. If she is ousted and one of her siblings controls the Cerulean Citadel, doubt and despair weaken her influence over her domain until she retakes her seat of power.": "拉米亚只有在控制蓝宝石王座时才能操纵她的领域并控制其边界。如果她被赶走了，而她的一个兄弟姐妹控制了塞鲁利亚城堡，怀疑和绝望就会削弱她对她的领域的影响，直到她重新夺回她的权力席位。",
	"An illusion masks Ramya's Undead state. Her true nature is revealed only by the chill of her skin and in her withered reflection. Ramya permits no mirrors in her presence, lest her curse be revealed.": "一个幻觉掩盖了拉姆亚的不死状态。她的真实本性只能通过她皮肤的寒气和她枯萎的倒影来显示。拉米亚不允许镜子出现在她面前，以免她的诅咒被暴露。",
	"Ramya is distant and aloof, though she craves connection. Those who speak with her find her measured in conversation, and capable of kindness and humor. However, a vein of paranoia runs through all her actions, and she reacts to any hint of suspicious words or deeds with creative and potentially lethal tests and punishments.": "拉米亚是个遥远而冷漠的人，尽管她渴望联系。那些与她交谈的人发现她在谈话中很有分寸，而且能够表现出仁慈和幽默感。然而，她的所有行为都贯穿着一种偏执的脉络，她对任何可疑的言行都会做出创造性的、可能是致命的测试和惩罚。",

	"Arijani is the charming face of resistance for all who oppose Ramya's control of the Sapphire Throne. Like Ramya and Reeva, Arijani was given a second life by the Dark Powers. Now a {@creature rakshasa}, Arijani uses his mastery of illusions and Reeva's insights to manipulate Ramya and his other foes. He's gregarious and enjoys the finer things in life, traits that ingratiate him with the wealthy and influential supporters he seeks to attract to his cause. These traits also allow him to cultivate a persona of vacant decadence, which he uses as a mask so his foes will underestimate him and reveal themselves. Arijani has faked his and Reeva's deaths on multiple occasions, after which they always return \"resurrected,\" leading Ramya to believe they can never be truly defeated.": "对于所有反对拉米亚控制蓝宝石王座的人来说，阿里贾尼是迷人的反抗者。像拉米亚和里瓦一样，阿里贾尼被黑暗势力赋予了第二次生命。现在，阿里贾尼是一个{@creature rakshasa}，他利用他对幻觉的掌握和里瓦的洞察力来操纵拉姆亚和他的其他敌人。他性格开朗，喜欢享受生活中的美好事物，这些特点使他与他试图吸引的富有和有影响力的支持者打成一片。这些特征也使他能够培养出一种空虚颓废的人格，他把这种人格当作面具，这样他的敌人就会低估他并暴露自己。阿里贾尼多次伪造他和里瓦的死亡，之后他们总是 \"复活\"，使拉姆亚相信他们永远无法被真正打败。",
	"Reeva remembers a time when she loved Ramya, before her sister eclipsed her in their family's esteem. Unable to overtake Ramya in leadership skills, she sought more subtle methods. Her interests in intrigue and magic intensified when she discovered a hidden library beneath the Cerulean Citadel—a repository of insidious magic hearkening back to the rule of certain tyrannical Vasavadan ancestors. Reeva uses what she discovered there to further Arijani's ambitions and yearns to gain control over the citadel so she can unearth its deepest, most insidious secrets.": "瑞瓦记得她曾爱过拉米亚，在她姐姐在他们家族的尊重中使她黯然失色之前。由于无法在领导能力上超越拉姆亚，她寻求更微妙的方法。她对阴谋和魔法的兴趣增强了，因为她发现了一个隐藏在塞鲁利亚城堡下面的图书馆--一个可以追溯到某些暴虐的瓦萨瓦丹祖先统治时期的阴险魔法的宝库。丽娃利用她在那里发现的东西来推进阿里贾尼的野心，并渴望获得对城堡的控制权，这样她就可以挖掘出城堡最深、最阴险的秘密。",
	"After her murder, Reeva was reborn as an {@creature arcanaloth}, a state that horrifies her. When frustrated, she vents her rage by instructing her servants to abduct someone she considers beautiful and then overseeing that beauty's destruction. Reeva is a cunning plotter, strategist, and manipulator. She applies these talents to her magic, entreating fiends for aid and using them to hasten the day when no one will underestimate her again. Many of Arijani's allies don't trust Reeva. Behind her back, they mockingly call her charismatic Arijani's opposite, or \"Inajira.\"": "在她被谋杀后，丽娃重生为{@creature arcanaloth}，这种状态让她感到恐惧。当她感到沮丧时，她会指示她的仆人绑架一个她认为美丽的人，然后监督这个美女的毁灭，以此来发泄她的怒火。瑞瓦是一个狡猾的阴谋家、战略家和操纵者。她将这些才能运用到她的魔法中，恳求恶魔们的帮助，并利用它们来加速实现没有人再低估她的一天。阿里贾尼的许多盟友都不信任里瓦。在她背后，他们嘲弄地称她为富有魅力的阿里贾尼的反面人物，或 \"伊纳吉拉\"。",
	"The struggle between the heirs to the Sapphire Throne drives the conflict in Kalakeri. Both Ramya's loyalists and Arijani and Reeva's rebels are fanatics, eager to report or act against those they consider traitors to the nation's rightful ruler or rulers. Meanwhile, the common folk in areas under a faction's clear control extol their loyalty to the local power loudly; in less stable areas, most keep their allegiance secret. While exploring the domain, characters regularly face questions about their loyalty—and in this conflict, neutrality is tantamount to betraying both sides. The characters' answers eventually earn them the attention of one side or the other, with members of that faction trying to dragoon them into the conflict.": "蓝宝石王座的继承人之间的斗争推动了卡拉凯里的冲突。拉米亚的忠诚者和阿里贾尼与里瓦的叛军都是狂热分子，急于举报或采取行动反对他们认为是国家合法统治者或统治者的叛徒。同时，在一个派别明确控制的地区，普通民众大声地颂扬他们对当地政权的忠诚；在不太稳定的地区，大多数人对他们的忠诚保持秘密。在探索这个领域的过程中，人物经常面临关于他们忠诚度的问题--在这场冲突中，中立就等于背叛了双方。人物的回答最终使他们受到一方或另一方的关注，该派别的成员试图将他们拖入冲突中。",
	"Judgment follows everything the characters do in Kalakeri. Those who support either of the domain's factions earn enemies and allies. Those who don't support a faction draw suspicion. Those who play the factions against one another might earn the favor of both—but for how long?": "审判伴随着人物在卡拉凯里的一切行为。那些支持该领域任何一个派别的人都会赢得敌人和盟友。那些不支持某个派别的人则被怀疑。那些在派别之间相互博弈的人可能会赢得两个派别的青睐，但能持续多久？",

As they do so, their standing with the factions changes, granting them access to favors or provoking reprisals. Characters adjust their renown score once per adventure, and rarely by more than 5 points. The Renown in Kalakeri table notes activities that increase or decrease a character's renown score.": "使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的{@book renown|DMG|1|Renown}系统，追踪人物在卡拉凯里的两个派别中的地位。每个角色在每个派别中的声望值都是0。角色在与任何一个派别作对或为其服务时都会获得或失去积分。当他们这样做的时候，他们在这两个派别中的地位就会发生变化，从而使他们获得好处或引起报复。角色在每次冒险中都会调整他们的声望值，而且很少超过5点。卡拉凯里的声望表指出了增加或减少角色声望分数的活动。",
	"When dealing with Kalakeri's factions, every option or choice has ramifications. Give the characters opportunities to meet, interact with, and rise in the esteem of Ramya, Arijani, and Reeva. As they do, highlight the monstrous nature of the three villains and that dealing with them involves hard choices. The renown system requires the characters to become active participants in the horrors of Kalakeri, encouraging them to ally with evil beings or make uncomfortable concessions to win greater victories later. Perhaps the characters betray Ramya in a way that evicts her from Jadurai for years, or cause one of Arijani and Reeva's political alliances to crumble. How far will they go for such opportunities?": "在处理卡拉凯里的派别时，每个选项或选择都会产生影响。让人物有机会认识拉姆亚、阿里贾尼和里瓦，并与他们互动，提高他们的威望。当他们这样做的时候，要强调这三个反派的可怕性质，以及与他们打交道需要做出艰难的选择。声望系统要求角色成为卡拉凯里恐怖事件的积极参与者，鼓励他们与邪恶的生命结盟，或做出不舒服的让步，以便日后赢得更大的胜利。也许人物背叛了拉米亚，使她被驱逐出贾杜里多年，或者导致阿里贾尼和里瓦的政治联盟之一崩溃。为了这样的机会，他们会走多远？",
	"Whether the characters back Ramya or Arijani and Reeva, or seek to play both sides, those who advance in their standing with a faction advance in that side's esteem, gaining favor with that faction's leader or leaders and influence over their plots. Use the examples of these benefits in the following sections to guide you in creating further rewards and concessions appropriate to the characters' standing.": "无论角色是支持拉米亚，还是支持阿里贾尼和里瓦，或者试图同时扮演两边的角色，那些在某一派别中地位提高的人都会得到该派别的尊重，获得该派别领导人的青睐，并对其情节产生影响。利用以下章节中这些好处的例子来指导你进一步创造适合于角色地位的奖励和让步。",

As a result, the characters might walk the razor's edge of loyalty and betrayal in hopes of furthering their own goals.": "角色有可能在某一派别中获得声誉，也有可能背叛该派别，但仍能在该团体中保持一定程度的尊重。因此，角色可能会在为两个团体服务中穿针引线。在卡拉凯里，关系不断变化，怨恨很少持续很久。因此，人物可能会在忠诚和背叛的边缘徘徊，希望能进一步实现自己的目标。",
	"Kalakeri's factions are locked in a stalemate, their victories and losses forgotten within days or weeks. Characters who interact with the factions might change this balance.

Such actions put the characters at risk, but if they don't intercede, who will?": "卡拉凯里的各派别陷入了僵局，他们的胜利和失败在几天或几周内就会被遗忘。与各派别互动的角色可能会改变这种平衡。但是，如果任何一个派别牢牢地控制了卡拉凯里，他们的领导人就会在这片土地上实施他们可怕的计划，这只会导致持续的痛苦。黑暗势力确保被击败的派别不会被长期镇压下去。角色们可能会试图获得对拉米亚或阿里贾尼和里瓦的影响，以遏制恶棍的暴行，减轻卡拉凯里的邪恶行为。这样的行动使人物处于危险之中，但如果他们不干预，谁来干预？",

Within a week, the nation's government had crumbled, its defenders fleeing before an army that bore the red-stained coffin of Harkon Lukas at its head.

To this end, he often exploits ambitious and naive new talent. He collects promising up-and-coming performers, becomes their mentor, traps them within the bond of lycanthropy, and then uses them as tools (see the \"{@book Insatiable Hungers|VRGR|3|Insatiable Hungers}\" section later in this domain for details).

Some days, the sun rises over Pont-a-Museau as if it were an ordinary city, and not one in which many of the buildings stand empty and abandoned. On those days, people move freely through the open gates, and the silent, heavily armored guards of the Casques Silencieux watch over calm promenades and markets. But a day or a week or a month later, the first telltale cough cracks amid the crowd. As people evacuate the streets and lock their doors, rats crawl from the sewers in tremendous numbers. Shortly thereafter, the gates slam shut.

The city's abundant space could easily house twenty thousand souls, but although it's Richemulot's most populous city, fewer than half that number live here. Still, Pont-a-Museau's casual sophistication hints at a cosmopolitan past.

	"The citizens of Pont-a-Museau share their city with rats. These vermin are a ubiquitous presence, and visitors become accustomed to the flash of sudden movement at the periphery of their vision.

	"Unknown to all but the Renier family and their staunchest allies, Chateau Delanuit stands above the inscrutable Inverted Court, a downward-spilling palace that connects to the vast sewer system of Pont-a-Museau and beyond.

	"Though Saint Ronges shares the same mysterious origin as the rest of Richemulot's cities, the cause of its depopulation is well known: the Plague strikes harder here, and for longer, than anywhere else in the domain.": "尽管圣荣格与里希姆洛特的其他城市有着相同的神秘起源，但其人口减少的原因是众所周知的：瘟疫在这里发作得更厉害，时间也更长，比该地区的其他地方都要长。",
	"This was not always so. When Jacqueline Renier first ascended to the throne and imposed her law upon the land, the people of Saint Ronges resisted her rule. Renier granted the city its freedom, absent the support and infrastructure of the state.

For now, she is still considering.": "这并不总是如此。当杰奎琳-雷尼尔第一次登上王位并将她的法律强加于这片土地时，圣荣格的人民抵制了她的统治。雷尼尔在没有国家支持和基础设施的情况下，给予了城市自由。时至今日，情况依然如此，尽管日益减少的圣荣格人民议会早已吸取了教训。议会多次向雷尼尔小姐请求宽恕。目前，她还在考虑。",
	"Mortigny is both the smallest of Richemulot's three cities and the most overcrowded; its streets are congested and its buildings strained to capacity. The town resembles an extended tenement, with new construction built atop old and hastily thrown together shanties lining the inside of its walls.": "莫蒂尼既是里希姆洛特三个城市中最小的一个，也是最拥挤的一个；它的街道拥挤不堪，它的建筑也紧张得难以负荷。这座城市就像一个扩大的公寓，新的建筑建在旧的和匆忙拼凑的棚屋上，在城墙内侧排列。",
	"Mortigny is quickly quarantined during surges of plague, but anyone is allowed to enter the city so long as they do so with the understanding that they can't leave. Small communities across the domain send their sick to Mortigny, both to be rid of them and because the city has Richemulot's largest concentration of medical practitioners. The best of these healers work at Mortigny West Clinic under Doctor Simone Temator. Doctors across the city fight tirelessly to aid the sick and research new treatments for the Gnaws, but ultimately their work does little to curb the disease. Many desperate practitioners have turned to unconventional methods to halt the plague's spread.": "瘟疫爆发时，莫蒂尼会被迅速隔离，但任何人都可以进入该市，只要他们明白自己不能离开。整个地区的小社区都把他们的病人送到莫蒂尼，一方面是为了摆脱他们，另一方面是因为这个城市拥有里希姆洛特最集中的医疗人员。这些医者中最优秀的人在莫蒂尼西部诊所工作，由西蒙娜-特马托医生负责。全市的医生都在不知疲倦地帮助病人，并研究治疗啃食者的新方法，但最终他们的工作对遏制这种疾病没有什么作用。许多绝望的医生已经转向非常规的方法来阻止瘟疫的蔓延。",
	"A century ago, Richemulot was a lively place. In those days, not a building stood vacant as merchants from both ends of the Musarde set up shop along the broad boulevards of Pont-a-Museau. As wealth trickled into the merchants' coffers, those of low birth began to taste the benefits of nobility.": "一个世纪前，里希穆洛是一个热闹的地方。当时，穆萨德两端的商人在穆索桥（Pont-a-Museau）宽阔的林荫道上开店，没有一栋建筑是空置的。随着财富源源不断地进入商人的库房，那些出身低微的人开始品尝到贵族的好处。",
	"Renier saw how the city was changing and tried to convince her family of the danger it posed. The burgeoning middle class sapped her family's authority, transforming them from lords over the commoners into mere landlords. But Renier's family surrendered to the times. Her grandfather grew infirm over the years and less able to look out for the family's interests, and the others—even her twin sister, Louise—seemed oblivious to the threat. It fell to Jacqueline to correct their failings.": "雷尼尔看到了城市的变化，并试图说服她的家人相信它带来的危险。蓬勃发展的中产阶级削弱了她家的权威，使他们从平民的领主变成了单纯的地主。但雷尼尔的家人向时代投降了。她的祖父多年来变得体弱多病，没有能力照顾家族的利益，而其他人--甚至她的双胞胎妹妹路易斯--似乎对这种威胁视而不见。纠正他们的错误的任务落在了杰奎琳身上。",
	"Finding like-minded souls took Renier years, but she finally became aware of the mysterious Trueblood Council, a secret society of Richemulot's eldest and most esteemed families. Expending a fortune, Renier aggressively pursued membership. Finally she was granted an invitation to join the society's members at their meeting place hidden among the sewers of Pont-a-Museau. But when Renier arrived, she found a throng of filthy commoners, not the dramatic masterminds she'd expected. As she cursed them and set off to fetch the guards, the council members revealed their true {@creature wererat} forms. That night, she was inducted into their ranks.": "寻找志同道合的灵魂花了Renier很多年，但她终于知道了神秘的真血理事会，一个由Richemulot最古老和最受尊敬的家族组成的秘密社团。雷尼尔花了一大笔钱，积极争取加入。最后，她被邀请到隐藏在Pont-a-Museau下水道中的会议地点加入该协会的成员。但当雷尼尔到达时，她发现一群肮脏的平民，而不是她所期望的戏剧性的主谋。当她诅咒他们并出发去找卫兵时，议会成员暴露了他们的真实{@creature wererat}形态。那天晚上，她被纳入了他们的行列。",
	"Renier swiftly accepted her new life as a wererat and her status as a member of Richemulot's first inhabitants. Her spite toward the lowborn turned instead toward non-wererats. Her first major act consisted of conferring the gift of lycanthropy upon her family. Only her twin, Louise, resisted, for which Jacqueline disfigured her and cast her out.": "雷尼尔很快就接受了她作为狼人的新生活，以及她作为Richemulot第一批居民的身份。她对低等民族的怨恨转而针对非狼人。她的第一个主要行为是将狼人的天赋赋予她的家人。只有她的双胞胎路易丝反抗，为此杰奎琳毁了她的容并把她赶了出去。",
	"Next, she bent her wererat allies to her vicious pursuit of control, unifying the country's verminous hordes. Within the sewers of Pont-a-Museau, the wererats concocted a roiling pestilence incubated in the filth of the bourgeoisie. Disease was not unknown in Richemulot, but the virulence of this new Gnawing Plague sent panic through the populace. The disease killed indiscriminately, wiping out the nation's royal dynasty and leaving power vacuums filled and then quickly emptied by ailing nobles. Only the Reniers proved immune, and eventually Jacqueline stood as the highest-born noble in the land, and the nation's de facto leader.": "接下来，她让她的狼人盟友屈服于她对控制的恶性追求，统一了全国的害群之马。在蒙特-阿-穆索的下水道里，狼人在资产阶级的污垢中酝酿了一场沸腾的瘟疫。疾病在里希穆洛并非不存在，但这种新的啃食性瘟疫的毒性使民众感到恐慌。这种疾病不分青红皂白地杀人，消灭了国家的皇室王朝，留下了权力真空，然后迅速被生病的贵族们清空。只有雷尼尔家族被证明是免疫的，最终杰奎琳成为这片土地上出生率最高的贵族，也是国家的实际领导人。",
	"The people begged Renier for help. Disgusted by the masses, she deemed them unworthy merely for the circumstance of their birth and the scarcity of coins in their pockets, Renier let them die.

	"The Inverted Court beneath Chateau Delanuit holds hidden sewer laboratories where wererat alchemists endlessly brew ever-more-virulent strains of the Gnawing Plague and even worse maladies. Rats are then infected with these diseases to spread them across the domain. As each strain is subtly different, creatures might fall victim to the Gnawing Plague again and again.": "德拉努特城堡下面的反转法庭有隐藏的下水道实验室，在那里，狼人的炼金术士们无休止地酿造出越来越多的恶毒的啃食性瘟疫和更糟糕的疾病。然后，老鼠被感染了这些疾病，在整个领域内传播。由于每一种菌株都有微妙的不同，生物可能一次又一次地成为啃食性瘟疫的受害者。",
	"Jacqueline Renier can understand and magically command any rat within 120 feet of her using limited telepathy. All rats in Richemulot are especially intelligent and eagerly obey Renier's will.

	"As Darklord and de facto steward of Richemulot, Jacqueline Renier stands at the height of society. However, when Richemulot was claimed by the Mists, its populace consisted mostly of commoners once more. Rather than ruling a land dominated by her wererat peers, Renier now endures various torments:": "作为黑暗领主和Richemulot的事实上的管家，杰奎琳-雷尼尔站在社会的顶峰。然而，当Richemulot被迷雾夺走时，它的人口再次由大部分平民组成。雷尼尔现在不是在统治一块由她的狼人同僚主导的土地，而是在忍受各种折磨。",

Their brutish father and brothers resented the girls, whose sufferings grew worse after their mother died. Desiring a better life, the sisters began preying upon travelers who passed by their secluded home. They murdered wealthy strangers, stole their valuables, and disposed of the bodies in their family's stewpot. The sisters' wickedness was revealed and when they squabbled over a stranger they all fancied and ultimately murdered the traveler. When the rest of the family discovered their terrible deeds, the sisters killed their father and brothers. As their murder spree unfolded, the Mists rose. When they cleared, unfamiliar mountains in a land called Tepest surrounded the sisters' simple valley home, and their true nature as vicious hags manifested.": "洛琳达、拉维达和莱蒂西亚是明德菲斯克姐妹，是小精灵送给她们孤独的母亲的礼物，她是一个善良、诚实的女人，希望有女儿可以珍惜。她们粗暴的父亲和兄弟们憎恨这些女孩，在母亲去世后，她们的痛苦越来越严重。为了追求更好的生活，姐妹俩开始掠夺路过她们隐居地的旅行者。她们谋杀了富有的陌生人，偷走了他们的贵重物品，并将尸体丢在家里的炖锅里。姐妹们的邪恶被揭露了，当她们为一个她们都喜欢的陌生人争吵时，最终谋杀了这个旅行者。当家庭的其他成员发现她们的可怕行为时，姐妹俩杀死了她们的父亲和兄弟。随着他们的谋杀行为的展开，迷雾也随之升起。当迷雾散去时，在一个叫Tepest的地方，陌生的山脉包围了姐妹俩简单的山谷家园，她们作为恶毒女巫的真实本性显现出来。",
	"From the strange fey of Tepest, the three hags learned magic that they used to prey upon the humans of the nearby valleys. Over generations, they became known as fickle sages and weavers of dooms and miracles. Strangers sought them out, begging for bountiful crops, potent medicines, or the children that fate denied them. The hags sowed blessings and despair in equal measure. Numerous hexblood children originated from the hags' cauldron. In time, the hag Lorinda asked her sisters to help create a child of their own. But Laveeda and Leticia refused, loathing the idea of sharing their magic and secrets.": "三位女巫从特佩斯特的怪人那里学会了魔法，用来捕食附近山谷中的人类。经过几代人的努力，她们被称为善变的圣人和厄运与奇迹的编织者。陌生的人寻找她们，乞求丰收的庄稼、有效的药物，或者命运拒绝给他们的孩子。女巫们在同等程度上播下了祝福和绝望的种子。无数的六合血统的孩子都来自女巫的大锅。到后来，女巫洛琳达要求她的姐妹们帮助创造一个属于她们自己的孩子。但拉维达和莱蒂西亚拒绝了，她们厌恶分享她们的魔法和秘密的想法。",

Once adopted into the village, individuals must prove themselves by undertaking initiation ceremonies focused around surviving in the forest for a week with no tools.": "奥塞洛人偶尔会收养不听话的外来者，给予他们保护，使其免受心之审判。一旦被收养到村子里，个人必须通过参加入会仪式来证明自己，仪式的重点是在没有工具的情况下在森林里生存一个星期。",
	"The seat of power in Valachan, Pantara Lodge is a series of thatch buildings strung together high in the forest canopy, suspended above the overgrown ruins of a castle reclaimed by the jungle.

Chakuna's displacer beast hunting partner, Yana, remains by her side here.": "潘塔拉山庄是瓦拉昌的权力中心，它是一系列串联在森林树冠上的茅草建筑，悬挂在被丛林开垦的杂草丛生的城堡废墟上。查库纳的家只拥有最基本的必需品：一个军械库、一个医务室和一个流离失所者兽厩。查库纳的流离兽狩猎伙伴亚娜一直在她身边。",

Opposed to the rule of Chakuna, the Shuaran fear her deeply and might aid those who resist her, defining their relationships with strangers through a prickly, easily offended sense of honor. The Shuaran constantly guard against a local shrewdness of howling apes to the south near Yakum Beach. A soft and menacing whooping in the distance can be heard in the village at all times.": "舒阿兰村的熟练战士不像奥赛罗人那样会变身，尽管这里可以找到认为查库纳的统治受到诅咒并回避她的保护的奥赛罗难民。舒阿兰人反对查库纳的统治，他们深深地惧怕她，并可能帮助那些反抗她的人，通过一种带刺的、容易被冒犯的荣誉感来界定他们与陌生人的关系。舒阿兰人不断地防范着南方靠近雅库姆海滩的当地精明的嚎叫猿。在村子里随时都能听到远处轻柔而汹涌的呼啸声。",
	"The most secret of secret places in Valachan, Yaguara's Heart lies at the center of a maze of mountains southwest of Pantara Lodge. Within this canyon lies a small, crumbling temple nestled among treacherous cliffs and grasping forest. In the blood-painted caverns hidden beneath the temple lies a stone altar bearing the still-beating heart of Darklord Chakuna. Here, an aspiring Darklord can perform a ritual to consume Chakuna's heart and take her place as ruler of Valachan, or destroy it and loose the sapient rage of the rain forest on anyone trapped within the domain's borders. Only Chakuna, the displacer beast Yana, and von Kharkov's remains know the location of Chakuna's heart and how to claim her power.": "亚瓜拉之心是瓦拉钱最隐秘的地方，位于潘塔拉山庄西南方向的迷宫山的中心。在这个峡谷中，有一座摇摇欲坠的小庙，依偎在险峻的悬崖和抓人的森林之间。在寺庙下面隐藏的血色洞穴中，有一个石质祭坛，上面有黑暗领主查库纳仍在跳动的心脏。在这里，一个有抱负的黑暗领主可以举行仪式来吞噬查库纳的心脏，并取代她作为瓦拉昌的统治者，或者摧毁它，将雨林的智慧怒火释放到任何被困在领域边界的人身上。只有查库纳、流离兽亚娜和冯-哈尔科夫的遗体知道查库纳心脏的位置以及如何获得她的力量。",

Chakuna's people, the Oselo, became his favorite targets.": "黑暗领主乌里克-冯-哈尔科夫（Urik von Kharkov）在现已毁坏的潘塔拉城堡（Castle Pantara）进行统治，这是一座充满暴政和折磨的堡垒，他在那里猎杀瓦拉昌的人民作为娱乐。在数不清的岁月里，狩猎活动越来越复杂，冯-哈尔科夫寻找着最稀有、最危险的猎物。查库纳的人民，奥塞洛人，成为他最喜欢的目标。",
	"The Oselo are hunters and people of the jungle. But by the light of the moon, many grow fur, claws, and fangs, revealing their true nature as watchful and dangerous lycanthropes. By the time Chakuna was a teenager, von Kharkov had fine-tuned the horror of his hunts into a regulated tournament. He hunted her people to the brink of extinction, preventing their escape by closing the domain's borders and trapping them within the Mists.": "奥赛罗人是猎人和丛林中的人。但在月光下，许多人长出了毛发、爪子和獠牙，暴露了他们作为警惕和危险的狼人的真实本性。在查库纳十几岁的时候，冯-哈尔科夫已经将他的恐怖狩猎活动调整为一场规范的比赛。他把她的族人猎杀到灭绝的边缘，通过关闭领地的边界并把他们困在迷雾中来防止他们逃跑。",
	"Chakuna swore to save her people. She entered the tournament freely, determined to turn the tables on von Kharkov or die. She vowed to sacrifice whatever it took to defeat the Darklord—but learned quickly that it takes monstrosity to beat a monster. Chakuna found von Kharkov's weakness, burned Castle Pantara to the ground, and kept the former Darklord's head.": "查库纳发誓要拯救她的人民。她自由地参加了比赛，决心扭转冯-哈尔科夫的局面，否则就得死。她发誓要不惜一切代价打败黑暗君主--但她很快就知道，要打败一个怪物，就必须要有怪兽。查库纳找到了冯-哈尔科夫的弱点，将潘塔拉城堡烧为平地，并保留了这位前黑暗君主的头颅。",
	"Chakuna gained her status as a Darklord when she defeated Urik von Kharkov.

	"Chakuna has no heart—literally. At the height of her contest with von Kharkov, she ripped it out of her chest with her fingers and placed it at the center of the Yaguara Mountain maze, then replaced it by taking and eating von Kharkov's heart. Doing so, she co-opted von Kharkov's powers and accursed immortality and claimed Valachan as her own. Within Yaguara's Heart, the sacred nexus of the maze, Chakuna's heart still beats as one with the land, infinitely connected and as robust as the rain forest. But like anything that lives, her tie with the domain she's claimed must be maintained. Life eats life. And so Chakuna sacrifices the blood of the hunted to the land to maintain her grip on power. If she doesn't, the plants and animals of the domain grow hostile, threatening to wipe out all who dwell there.": "查库纳没有心--字面上的意思。在她与冯-哈尔科夫较量的高峰期，她用手指把心脏从胸口扯了出来，放在亚瓜拉山迷宫的中心，然后把冯-哈尔科夫的心脏拿去吃了，以此来代替它。这样做，她就把冯-哈尔科夫的力量和被诅咒的不朽性合而为一，并把瓦拉钱据为己有。在亚瓜拉之心（Yaguara's Heart）--迷宫的圣地，查库纳的心脏仍在跳动，与土地融为一体，与热带雨林无限连接，并像雨林一样强壮。但就像任何有生命的东西一样，她与她所声称的领域的联系必须得到维护。生命吞噬生命。因此，查库纳将被猎杀者的血献给土地，以维持她对权力的控制。如果她不这样做，该地区的植物和动物就会产生敌意，威胁要消灭所有居住在那里的人。",
	"When Chakuna chooses to close the borders of her domain, the seas grow rough and the Mists rise. In addition to their normal effects (see \"{@book Influence of the Mists|VRGR|3|The Mists}\" at the start of this chapter), the Mists of Valachan are home to {@creature Displacer Beast||displacer beasts} and other deadly predators that attack all creatures they meet.": "当查库纳选择关闭她的领地边界时，大海变得波涛汹涌，迷雾上升。除了正常的影响（见本章开头的\"{@book Influence of the Mists|VRGR|3|The Mists}\"），瓦拉昌的迷雾是{@creature Displacer Beast||displacer beasts}和其他致命的掠食者的家，它们会攻击所有它们遇到的生物。",

She shields her people from the slaughter, but the rest of Valachan is fair game.": "查库纳与瓦拉昌的联系不同于其他大多数黑暗领主的领域联系，因为她的联系是自愿的。她必须无休止地将土地浸泡在血液中，以确保她的生存，并保护她的人民不受恶毒土地的影响，因此她发誓要阻止的狩猎现在以她的名义继续进行。她为她的人民挡住了屠杀，但瓦拉昌的其他地方是公平的游戏。",

	"However, the Mists find a way to twist even the best of intentions.

Fascinated, these socialites became obsessed with the occult, seeking out esoteric works, hiring doubtful fortune-tellers, and hosting parlor séances. In most cases, the results were passing fads. In some, they were catastrophic—the unprepared successfully summoned fiends and angry spirits into their salons. But a few earnest amateur spiritualists genuinely sought to learn more about the secrets beyond their homes, their lives, and the Mists. In these would-be occultists, the wereravens saw potential.": "然而，即使是最好的意图，迷雾也会找到一种扭曲的方式。在{@book Borca|VRGR|3}、{@book Darkon|VRGR|3}和{@book Dementlieu|VRGR|3}这样的城市里，狼人从{@book Barovia|VRGR|3}携带的神秘著作和护身符引起了无聊的精英们的注意。这些社会名流被迷住了，他们迷恋上了神秘学，寻找深奥的作品，雇用可疑的算命师，并举办客厅降神会。在大多数情况下，其结果只是一时的流行。在某些情况下，它们是灾难性的--没有准备的人成功地将恶魔和愤怒的灵魂召唤到他们的沙龙里。但也有少数认真的业余灵媒人真正想了解他们的家、他们的生活和迷雾之外的更多秘密。在这些可能的神秘主义者身上，狼人看到了潜力。",

	"Beyond Barovia, where the eldest wereraven members of the Keepers of the Feather keep a low profile, Keepers organize into small social clubs with shared interests in occultism. Some members are actual invested scholars, while others are simply bored rich folk. But all have a strong interest in séances, fortune-telling, secrets of the afterlife, sightings of mysterious creatures, metaphysical theories, and tales of the macabre. Among their misinterpretations and outright flimflam—like round planet theory and dikesha dice—Keepers also possess hints of truth and the tools wereravens have long used to combat evil. Among these are {@book spirit boards|VRGR|4|Spirit Board} (detailed in {@book chapter 4|VRGR|4}), tarokka decks, Mist talismans, and piecemeal occult writings from various domains.

	"Knowing the threats that Darklords and other evils pose, wereravens of the Keepers typically don't reveal themselves to those not of their kind. Rather, they infiltrate Keeper societies as reclusive members, traveling experts, or foreign scholars. Some Keepers also tell of sightings or visitations involving giant raven-like beings that appear, speak some prophecy or deliver some message, then vanish, often presaging either wonder or disaster. The wereravens take little issue with these exaggerated tales from those who've witnessed their hybrid forms, and they willingly play into the tales of the Keepers if it means spurring them to action.": "由于知道黑暗领主和其他邪恶势力所带来的威胁，守护者的狼人通常不会向非其同类的人暴露自己。相反，他们以隐居成员、旅行专家或外国学者的身份渗透到守护者社会中。一些守护者还讲述了目击或拜访的情况，其中涉及到巨大的乌鸦状生命，它们出现，说一些预言或传递一些信息，然后消失，往往预示着奇迹或灾难。狼人对那些目睹其混血形式的人的这些夸张的故事没有什么异议，而且如果这意味着刺激他们采取行动的话，他们愿意听从守护者的故事。",
	"Keeper cells strive to correspond and share discoveries between communities and domains. To facilitate this, the wereravens have taught some Keepers how to raise messenger ravens capable of delivering letters through the Mists. Most non-Keepers who learn of this consider it a trick, or fear what it means to receive messages from beyond the Mists, encouraging the Keepers to offer this rare service only to group members and their allies.

Rather, set expectations with your players about what a horror-focused game means, and determine what topics and themes will encourage or discourage players' participation.": "在你开展恐怖游戏之前，请考虑以下步骤，以确保玩家的意愿和充分参与。如果一群人聚集在一起玩一个有趣的、低风险的冒险游戏，但马上就被推入了意想不到的恐怖之中，那么这个游戏就会让人觉得是一个陷阱。你应该避免这种情况。相反，与你的玩家一起设定期望，了解以恐怖为重点的游戏意味着什么，并确定哪些话题和主题会鼓励或阻止玩家的参与。",
	"Your primary goal as a DM running a horror adventure is to facilitate a fun D&D experience. This book assumes you and your players enjoy the thrill and suspense of scary stories. The audience of a horror movie can enjoy the menace on screen because they know it can't harm them (and they have an idea of what to expect from the film's trailer). In the same way, your players count on you to make sure an adventure's terror doesn't target them personally or otherwise step beyond the game. Your goal is never to make players feel uncomfortable or threatened. As D&D adventures aren't scripted, unexpected elements can arise during play. If your whole group can agree to the terms outlined in this section, everyone should have an exciting, enjoyable experience.": "作为经营恐怖冒险的管理人，你的首要目标是促成一次有趣的D&D体验。本书假设你和你的玩家喜欢恐怖故事的刺激和悬念。恐怖电影的观众可以享受屏幕上的威胁，因为他们知道它不会伤害他们（而且他们从电影的预告片中了解到会发生什么）。以同样的方式，你的玩家指望你确保冒险中的恐怖不会针对他们个人或超出游戏的范围。你的目标是不要让玩家感到不舒服或受到威胁。由于D&D冒险并没有剧本，所以在游戏过程中可能会出现意想不到的因素。如果你的整个团队都能同意本节中列出的条款，那么每个人都应该有一个令人兴奋的、愉快的经历。",
	"Take advantage of the time before your first game session to learn about your players' thoughts related to horror adventures. To do this, create a brief list of questions focused on the following topics. After preparing this survey, distribute it to your players as an e-mail, physical handout, or otherwise before gathering to play. Keep the survey's results anonymous, but use them to guide what sort of adventures you'll create.": "利用第一次游戏会议之前的时间，了解你的玩家对恐怖冒险的相关想法。要做到这一点，请创建一个简短的问题清单，重点放在以下主题上。准备好这个调查表后，在游戏前以电子邮件、实物发放或其他方式分发给你的玩家。调查的结果是匿名的，但要用它来指导你创造什么样的冒险。",
	"Start your survey by listing common story and horror elements to determine your players' comfort with them. The following list is not exhaustive; customize your list to include elements you imagine could arise during adventures. End the list with a space where players can add other topics to avoid or that they're interested in. For each of these topics, ask whether it should be included or avoided:": "在调查开始时，列出常见的故事和恐怖元素，以确定你的玩家对它们的舒适度。下面的清单并不详尽，你可以根据自己的想象，将冒险过程中可能出现的元素自定义为清单。在列表的最后，玩家可以在空白处添加其他要避免的或他们感兴趣的话题。对于每一个话题，都要询问是否应该包括或避免。",
	"General phobias and common fears, such as clowns, needles, or spiders": "一般恐惧症和常见的恐惧，如小丑、针头或蜘蛛。",

	"If you're not comfortable adding any of these topics to your game, don't include them as options, and use them as the starting point for a list of elements that your adventures won't include.": "如果你不愿意在你的游戏中加入这些主题，就不要把它们作为选项，把它们作为你的冒险不包括的元素清单的起点。",
	"Many horror D&D games are spooky romps not too different from typical D&D adventures. Others venture into more unsettling territory. You and the players should decide what level of intensity is right for your horror adventures. This section provides guidance that applies whether your adventures are morbid comedies or explorations of mature themes. The advice here emphasizes structures that work for all players, including those with different tolerances for being scared or who have certain topics that are off-limits for them. Always consider what you can do to make players feel comfortable with your game, even if no one entirely knows how the horror might unfold. Never assume you know your players' deepest fears—no matter how long you've been roleplaying with them.": "许多恐怖的D&D游戏是幽灵般的漫游，与典型的D&D冒险没有太大区别。还有一些游戏则进入了更令人不安的领域。你和玩家应该决定什么程度的强度适合于你的恐怖冒险。本节提供的指导意见适用于你的冒险是丧心病狂的喜剧还是对成熟主题的探索。这里的建议强调了适用于所有玩家的结构，包括那些对惊吓有不同容忍度的玩家，或者对他们来说有某些禁忌的话题的玩家。始终考虑你能做些什么来使玩家对你的游戏感到舒适，即使没有人完全知道恐怖会如何展开。不要假设你知道你的玩家最深的恐惧--不管你和他们一起玩了多久的角色扮演。",
	"After your list of topics, use the following questions to query players about gameplay considerations:": "在你的主题清单之后，用以下问题询问玩家关于游戏的考虑。",
	"How scary do you want the game to be? Do you enjoy being creeped out as a player, or should the characters alone experience fear?": "你希望游戏有多可怕？作为玩家，你喜欢被吓到，还是应该让角色单独体验恐惧？",
	"How difficult do you want the game to be? Should there be a high, average, or low threat of death?": "你希望游戏的难度如何？应该有高的、一般的、还是低的死亡威胁？",
	"How do you feel about effects that take away your ability to control what your character does?": "你对那些剥夺了你控制你的角色的能力的效果有什么看法？",
	"Do you want to allow phones or other distractions at the game table, or should they be set aside?": "你想在游戏桌上允许手机或其他分心的东西，还是应该把它们放在一边？",
	"Are there any specific stories or rules you'd like to see highlighted during the game?": "有什么具体的故事或规则，你想在游戏中看到突出强调吗？",
	"Are there general events or experiences you don't want to see during the game?": "在游戏过程中，是否有你不希望看到的一般事件或经历？",
	"Do you have any accessibility needs that would make the game more enjoyable, such as captions for video calls or a specific kind of seating?": "你是否有任何无障碍需求，以使游戏更加愉快，如视频通话的字幕或特定类型的座位？",
	"Do you have any other notes or concerns?": "你是否有任何其他的注意事项或关切？",
	"Once you've completed this survey, distribute it to your players, give them a window of time to respond, then collect the results.

	"Make it clear that D&D is a group storytelling game. As the DM, you have a role in crafting adventures and arbitrating rules, but you aren't solely responsible for how much fun the group has. Everyone is responsible for the group's enjoyment of the game. By the same token, the whole group has a role in determining how scary the game is and how far that frightful content goes. {@book Chapter 1|VRGR|1} provides guidance for players participating in horror adventures. Make sure you and the players are aware of this and use it to inform character creation and play.": "清楚地表明，D&D是一个集体讲故事的游戏。作为DM，你在制定冒险和仲裁规则方面有一定的作用，但你并不完全对小组的乐趣负责。每个人都要对小组的游戏乐趣负责。同样的道理，整个小组在决定游戏的可怕程度以及可怕内容的范围方面也有作用。{@book Chapter 1|VRGR|1}为参与恐怖冒险的玩家提供指导。要确保你和玩家都知道这一点，并利用它来指导角色的创造和游戏。",
	"Review your takeaways from the content surveys. Then, informed by players' survey responses, present your list of content the game will not feature. These are your game's boundaries and will not be included. Emphasize that boundaries aren't negotiable, and neither you nor any of the players should bring them into the game.": "回顾你从内容调查中得到的收获。然后，根据玩家的调查回答，提出游戏不会出现的内容清单。这些是你的游戏的边界，不会被包括在内。强调界限是不能商量的，你和任何玩家都不应该把它们带入游戏。",
	"Note that boundaries may change during play. Encourage players to bring any additions to you, privately or in the moment, so you can add them to the list. When this happens, don't refer to past survey data, defend past choices, or ask players to explain their boundaries. Trust that players know their needs best, and update the game accordingly.": "注意，在游戏过程中，界限可能会改变。鼓励玩家私下或当场向你提出任何补充内容，这样你就可以把它们添加到列表中。当这种情况发生时，不要参考过去的调查数据，为过去的选择辩护，或要求玩家解释他们的界限。相信玩家最了解他们的需求，并相应地更新游戏。",
	"Let players know that this list of boundaries will be accessible during every session and that by playing, they agree to respect these boundaries. Make it clear that players who don't respect these boundaries will have to leave the game.": "让玩家知道，这份界限清单在每一节课上都可以查阅，通过游戏，他们同意尊重这些界限。明确指出，不尊重这些界限的玩家将不得不离开游戏。",
	"During session zero, the group can discuss ways to customize the game in the following ways:": "在第零次会议上，小组可以讨论以下列方式定制游戏的方法。",
	"If there are horror genres that players gravitated toward in the survey, see if there are elements players would like to use to inspire their characters.": "如果在调查中，有玩家倾向于的恐怖类型，看看是否有玩家想用来启发他们的角色的元素。",
	"If you already have ideas for the sorts of adventures you plan to run or your own Darklord and domain, share the general concepts you're interested in and see what players get excited about.": "如果你已经有了你打算运行的各种冒险的想法，或者你自己的黑暗领主和领域，那就分享你感兴趣的一般概念，看看玩家会对什么感到兴奋。",
	"If players want to discuss their characters or create them collaboratively, now is a great time to do so.": "如果玩家想讨论他们的角色或合作创造他们，现在是一个很好的时机。",
	"If there are optional rules—like those presented later in this chapter—that you're amenable to using, determine which ones work best for the group.": "如果有一些可选的规则--如本章后面介绍的那些--你可以使用，请确定哪些规则最适合小组。",
	"While preparing and running frightening adventures, keep in mind the ebb and flow of suspense. Atmosphere, pacing, description, and player involvement all influence a game's tension and directly contribute to how scary your adventures feel.": "在准备和进行可怕的冒险时，要记住悬念的起伏。气氛、节奏、描述和玩家的参与都会影响游戏的紧张感，并直接影响到你的冒险的恐怖程度。",
	"Atmosphere is the overall mood of your game. It's the sense of levity, excitement, or dread that stems from a story's content and players' perception of it. Atmosphere can be challenging to build and easy to disrupt, but any D&D game—particularly scary games—benefit from your work to cultivate an atmosphere consistent with the experience you're trying to create. Consider the following elements to influence your game's atmosphere and create moody trappings for your horror adventures. Customize what you can and don't fret about what you can't.": "气氛是你游戏的整体情绪。它是源于故事内容和玩家对它的感知的轻松、兴奋或恐惧的感觉。气氛的建立具有挑战性，也很容易被破坏，但任何D&D游戏--尤其是恐怖游戏--都会从你培养与你试图创造的经验相一致的气氛的工作中受益。考虑以下元素来影响你的游戏氛围，并为你的恐怖冒险创造情绪化的衬托。定制你能做的，不要为你不能做的而烦恼。",
	"When choosing the space you'll be playing in, review any accessibility needs communicated in the content survey. Accommodate what you can; communicate what you can't as early as possible. Enlist players for help. Players may have difficulty with low light, loud background music, small printed text, strong odors, cramped spaces, specific allergens, or challenges with programs (if playing online). If any player identified these as an issue, don't use them to create an unnerving atmosphere. Recognize the difference between creating a moody atmosphere and making it difficult for players to participate.": "当选择你要玩的空间时，审查任何在内容调查中沟通的无障碍需求。能适应的就适应，不能适应的就尽早沟通。争取玩家的帮助。玩家可能对光线不足、嘈杂的背景音乐、小的印刷品、强烈的气味、狭窄的空间、特定的过敏原或程序的挑战（如果在线游戏）有困难。如果有玩家发现这些是一个问题，不要用它们来创造一个令人不安的气氛。认识到创造一个令人不安的气氛和让玩家难以参与之间的区别。",
	"If possible, play in an area with minimal visual or auditory distractions. Favor surroundings that appropriately reinforce your desired atmosphere and have little non-player traffic. If space is shared, negotiate with non-players to reserve the space in advance. You can also reduce distracting stimuli by turning screens off, covering decorations, and moving unnecessary objects away.": "如果可能的话，在一个视觉或听觉干扰最小的地方进行游戏。倾向于选择能适当加强你所期望的气氛的环境，并且没有什么非玩家的交通。如果空间是共享的，与非游戏者协商，提前保留空间。你也可以通过关闭屏幕、遮盖装饰物和移开不必要的物品来减少分心的刺激。",
	"Consider what fills the pauses in the game's action or other quiet moments. Lulls breed distractions. Subtle music, though, can fill such instances while reinforcing the game's atmosphere. Search for ambient, atmospheric, or instrumental music. Choose options without lyrics and that aren't recognizably tied to popular media. Create playlists in advance. If you can subtly control volume, slowly raise it when you want attention, and lower it when players are talking. Experiment with how volume and tempo influence whether a scene feels subdued or energetic.": "考虑用什么来填补游戏行动中的停顿或其他安静时刻。停顿会使人分心。不过，微妙的音乐可以填补这种情况，同时加强游戏的气氛。搜索环境、大气或器乐的音乐。选择没有歌词的、与流行媒体没有明显联系的选项。提前创建播放列表。如果你能巧妙地控制音量，在你希望得到关注时慢慢提高音量，在玩家交谈时降低音量。实验一下音量和节奏如何影响一个场景的感觉是低调还是有活力。",
	"Dimming the lights can transform your game space, causing distractions to fade and making it look unfamiliar. If the lighting's easy to control, you might adjust it to suggest a setting's light level. More elaborate techniques might involve using colored lights or using patterned cut-outs to cast eerie shadows. Whenever manipulating lighting, though, always ensure players have enough light to read by.": "调暗灯光可以改变你的游戏空间，使分散的注意力消退，使它看起来不熟悉。如果灯光容易控制，你可以调整它来暗示一个场景的光照程度。更复杂的技术可能涉及到使用彩色灯光或使用有图案的切口来投射阴森的阴影。不过，无论何时操纵灯光，都要确保玩家有足够的光线来阅读。",
	"A distraction for one player may be a necessity for another. Discuss compromises that benefit everyone. Maybe food and non-game items are kept away from the play space. Perhaps phones and tablets are permitted as long as they are silenced and used away from the table. Additionally, not everyone is comfortable being photographed or identified in public discussions of a game, whether in real-time or after a session, so ask about the place of social media in the game before making assumptions.": "对一个玩家来说，分散注意力可能是另一个玩家的需要。讨论对每个人都有利的折衷方案。也许食物和非游戏物品要远离游戏空间。也许允许使用手机和平板电脑，只要它们是静音的，并在远离桌子的地方使用。此外，不是每个人都愿意在公开讨论游戏时被拍照或识别，无论是实时的还是会后的，所以在做出假设之前要询问社交媒体在游戏中的位置。",
	"You have incredible control over your game's tone and atmosphere. Model the behaviors you want players to emulate by staying focused on the game, letting others speak in turn, heading off encroachment on boundaries, and complimenting exciting choices. Stand or pace during intense moments. Speak faster or sound anxious when something scary is happening. Raise the volume of your voice during pitched battles and whisper during tense or conspiratorial moments. Allow yourself to sound uncertain, correct yourself, or pause as if you heard something outside. Ask players, \"Are you sure?\" Engaging with the suspenseful atmosphere you want to create helps bring it into being around you.": "你对你的游戏的语气和气氛有难以置信的控制。通过保持对游戏的关注，让其他人轮流发言，阻止对边界的侵犯，以及赞扬令人兴奋的选择，来塑造你希望玩家效仿的行为。在紧张的时刻站起来或踱步。当有可怕的事情发生时，说得更快或听起来很焦虑。在激烈的战斗中提高你的音量，在紧张或阴谋的时刻小声说话。允许自己发出不确定的声音，纠正自己，或暂停一下，就像你听到了外面的声音一样。问玩家：\"你确定吗？\" 与你想创造的悬疑气氛打交道，有助于把它带到你身边。",
	"Pacing is the speed and energy with which your story unfolds. This relates to the amount of action in your game and, in a horror adventure, the tension or frequency of suspenseful moments. Everything can't be scary, and continuous terror is unsustainable. Before players grow numb to endless tension, create opportunities for them to catch their breath and regain a temporary feeling of calm. The best horror adventures are like roller coasters, ratcheting up suspense and releasing it before building toward the next harrowing moment. Also, mix up social interaction, exploration, combat, and other types of encounters to create interesting and engaging pacing. Ensure that scenes are always somehow relevant to your story and move characters toward their goals.": "节奏是你的故事展开的速度和能量。这与游戏中的动作量有关，而在恐怖冒险中，则与悬念的紧张程度或频率有关。不可能每件事都是可怕的，连续的恐怖是不可持续的。在玩家对无休止的紧张感感到麻木之前，创造机会让他们喘口气，恢复暂时的平静感。最好的恐怖冒险就像过山车一样，在建立下一个令人痛心的时刻之前，逐步增加悬念并释放它。另外，将社会互动、探索、战斗和其他类型的遭遇混合起来，以创造有趣的、有吸引力的节奏。确保场景总是与你的故事有某种程度的关联，并使人物朝着他们的目标前进。",
	"You often have less time to play than you think once late starts, food breaks, and other interruptions are all taken into account. When planning your adventures, account for less time than your full game session.": "一旦考虑到延迟开始、吃饭休息和其他干扰因素，你的游戏时间往往比你想象的要少。在计划你的冒险时，要考虑到比你整个游戏时间更少的时间。",
	"Dread and uncertainty are keys to engaging horror adventures. Horrific experiences or supernatural settings undermine assumptions about what can or can't happen. Have a character wake from a prophetic nightmare with a fresh scar. Have a threat characters are fleeing appear ahead of them. Make candles gutter, paintings cry, animals whisper curses, or gigantic eyes peer through windows. Did these things actually happen, or are characters' senses turning against them? The answers often don't matter, particularly when the Mists provide explanations for all manner of casually dreadful impossibilities.": "恐惧和不确定性是吸引人的恐怖冒险的关键。可怕的经历或超自然的环境破坏了关于什么可以或不可以发生的假设。让角色从一个预言性的噩梦中醒来，身上有一个新的伤疤。让人物逃离的威胁出现在他们面前。让烛光闪闪，让画作哭泣，让动物低声咒骂，或者让巨大的眼睛透过窗户窥视。这些事情是真的发生了，还是人物的感觉与他们作对？答案往往并不重要，特别是当迷雾为各种随意的可怕的不可能提供解释的时候。",
	"Occasionally slow your adventure's pace to draw out the tension you've established. Linger on describing sensory details. Ask players to describe what their characters are thinking, feeling, or fixating on. Detail the ways objects could be used violently, words could be lies, and shadows could hide monsters. Ask players what they think is the worst possible thing that could happen right now. Describe feelings of being watched. Hint that the characters are being hunted. Let characters respond to these stray thoughts. Sometimes these impressions should just be their nervousness getting to them. But sometimes it's the calm before a threat strikes.": "偶尔放慢你的冒险步伐，以引出你所建立的紧张关系。逗留在描述感官细节上。要求玩家描述他们的角色在想什么，感觉什么，或者固定在哪里。详细描述物体可能被暴力使用、话语可能是谎言、阴影可能隐藏怪物的方式。问玩家他们认为现在可能发生的最糟糕的事情是什么。描述被监视的感觉。暗示角色正在被追捕。让角色对这些游离的想法做出反应。有时候，这些印象应该只是他们的紧张情绪在作祟。但有时它是威胁发生前的平静。",
	"When the time for action comes, make your narration feel urgent. Speak quickly and in short bursts. Focus less on senses and more on descriptions of impact—a splash of crimson, who knows where it came from? Split the characters' attention. Roleplay other creatures begging, panicking, and trying to escape. Politely demand players react quickly: \"There's no time to debate—what do you do?\"": "当行动的时候，要让你的叙述有紧迫感。说话要快，要有短促的节奏。少关注感官，多关注影响的描述--一抹深红色，谁知道它从哪里来？分散人物的注意力。扮演其他生物乞求、惊慌和试图逃跑的角色。礼貌地要求玩家迅速做出反应。\"没有时间争论了，你怎么做？\"",
	"Occasionally encourage players to split the party. When characters are separated, cut back and forth between them. Encourage everyone to watch even scenes their characters aren't in. Keep these split scenes short, and when an exciting event occurs, cut away and make the players wait for resolution. Give characters things to tell one another when they meet again. Players can then decide whether or not their characters trust such reports.": "偶尔鼓励玩家分开聚会。当角色被分开时，在他们之间来回切换。鼓励每个人观看他们的角色不在其中的场景。保持这些分割场景的简短，当一个激动人心的事件发生时，切开并让玩家等待解决。当他们再次见面时，给角色们一些要告诉对方的东西。然后，玩家可以决定他们的角色是否相信这些报告。",
	"Reliability and trust are just as important to your horror adventures as lurid shocks. Frequent betrayals encourage paranoia that can paralyze players. Emphasize that certain people and locations will never turn on the characters through repeated positive encounters. The players can trust these allies, but can they keep them safe?": "可靠性和信任对于你的恐怖冒险来说，和令人毛骨悚然的震撼一样重要。频繁的背叛会助长玩家的偏执狂，从而使他们瘫痪。通过反复的正面接触，强调某些人和地点永远不会背叛角色。玩家可以信任这些盟友，但他们能保证他们的安全吗？",
	"Fear without hope tempts paralysis and apathy, which can ruin the game. Reward characters who behave dramatically, heroically, or in ways that increase the game's frightful atmosphere. Rewards might include brief scenes focused on a character's actions, opportunities to regroup and rest, clues to adversaries' weaknesses, and discoveries of actual treasure. To maintain character agency, avoid having strangers or allies of the group rescue characters from problems they got themselves into. By the same token, don't throw characters into impossible situations. Never let hope die.": "没有希望的恐惧会诱发麻痹和冷漠，这可能会毁掉游戏。奖励那些有戏剧性的、英勇的、或能增加游戏恐怖气氛的角色。奖励可以包括专注于角色行动的简短场景、重组和休息的机会、对手弱点的线索，以及发现实际的宝藏。为了保持角色的自主性，避免让陌生人或团体的盟友把角色从他们自己陷入的问题中拯救出来。同样，也不要把人物扔到不可能的情况下。不要让希望破灭。",
	"Leave players excited to play again. When ending a session, implement one of the following to conclude on a cliffhanger: hint at a new threat, impose a complication on existing plans, increase the stakes, introduce a new mystery, have a foe appear, have the world change, or otherwise shock the characters, then call for a break before players can react.": "让玩家对再次游戏感到兴奋。在结束一个环节时，实施以下措施以悬崖勒马：暗示一个新的威胁，使现有的计划变得复杂，增加赌注，引入一个新的谜团，让一个敌人出现，让世界发生变化，或以其他方式震撼角色，然后在玩家能够做出反应之前要求休息。",
	"The horrors populating your adventures can take endless forms, whether they be foes, impending events, or magical forces.

Also consider the following elements when describing terrors:": "充斥在你的冒险中的恐怖可以有无尽的形式，无论是敌人、即将发生的事件，还是魔法力量。与其仅仅说出可怕的东西是什么，不如通过分阶段间接地描述一个恐怖事件来激发你的玩家的想象力。{@book Chapter 5|VRGR|5}特征的建议，或使熟悉的怪物更加可怕。在描述恐怖时还要考虑以下要素。",

	"What does it smell like? How does it breathe? Does it cool the air around it or bring heat wherever it goes? How does it stand? When it reaches out to grab a character, what does it feel like?": "它闻起来像什么？它是如何呼吸的？它是冷却周围的空气还是把热量带到它所到之处？它是如何站立的？当它伸出手去抓一个人物时，它的感觉是什么？",
	"How does it attack? Does it have weapons, or does it use its body to fight? Does it have sharp claws that rake across flesh, or is it a supernatural force that warps what it comes in contact with?": "它是如何攻击的？它是有武器，还是用它的身体来战斗？它是有锋利的爪子划过肉体，还是有一种超自然的力量让它接触到的东西变形？",
	"When it's wounded, how does it react? What does its blood look like? What is inside it instead of flesh and blood? When it becomes desperate, how does it react?": "当它受伤的时候，它有什么反应？它的血是什么样子的？它体内有什么，而不是血肉之躯？当它变得绝望时，它有什么反应？",
	"Invite players to turn their imaginations against themselves. Leave details intentionally blank, describing just enough to reveal gaps that inspire horrific implications. Fixate on a specific trait, like only describing a vampire's eyes as it attacks.": "邀请玩家将他们的想象力与自己作对。故意留出细节空白，描述的内容只够揭示差距，激发出可怕的影响。固定在一个特定的特征上，比如只描述一个吸血鬼攻击时的眼睛。",
	"Alternatively, directly ask players to fill in details. Ask questions like these: What does the way it moves remind you of? It emits the worst smell—what is it? Something falls free and, for an instant, what are you certain it is? Players' responses don't need to control the narrative; it's up to you whether they're true or just one perception.": "或者，直接要求玩家填写细节。提出类似这样的问题。它的运动方式让你想起了什么？它散发出最难闻的气味--那是什么？有东西自由落体，在一瞬间，你确定它是什么？玩家的回答不需要控制叙事；它们是真实的还是只是一种看法，取决于你。",
	"Just as you consider how you'll tell your tales of terror, keep in mind what you can do to make the experience of playing the game more suspenseful.": "就在你考虑如何讲述你的恐怖故事时，请记住你可以做什么来使玩游戏的体验更有悬念。",
	"While horror traditionally nullifies heroes' strengths, doing so can remove the players' agency and undercut their enjoyment. Beyond the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} advice for creating dangerous encounters, consider the following techniques to make combat feel more menacing:": "虽然传统意义上的恐怖会使英雄的力量失效，但这样做会使玩家的代理权消失，削弱他们的乐趣。除了{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}关于创造危险遭遇的建议外，还可以考虑以下技巧，使战斗感觉更有威胁性。",

	"Have foes spend combat actions doing things that are fundamentally creepy, like chanting to sinister gods or regurgitating their last meal.": "让敌人用战斗行动来做一些根本上令人毛骨悚然的事情，比如对阴险的神灵吟唱或反刍他们的最后一餐。",
	"Use another creature as the opening act for the true threat. A notorious monster is all the scarier when it emerges and rips apart something the characters assumed was their true antagonist.": "用另一种生物作为真正威胁的开场白。当一个臭名昭著的怪物出现并撕碎了角色们认为是他们真正对手的东西时，它就更可怕了。",
	"Have foes play dead, only to \"return to life\" after characters think things are safe.": "让敌人装死，只有在人物认为事情安全后才会 \"复活\"。",

	"Matter-of-factly provide opportunities for everyone to be exceptional. Magical settings bear no resemblance to real-world history, and character creation rules presuppose no standard bar for heroics.": "实事求是地为每个人提供出人头地的机会。魔法设定与现实世界的历史没有任何相似之处，而且角色创建规则也没有预设英雄的标准标准。",
	"A typical D&D session is longer than a typical horror movie, and it can be hard to sustain the atmosphere for hours on end. Plan to take breaks during your game session, and encourage players to step away from the table if they need to. If you feel like the game has gotten intense or taken a turn someone's not enjoying, ask, \"Is everyone comfortable with continuing?\" before proceeding. If anyone's not, thank the players for their honesty and hasten the game to a cliffhanger. Before the next game session, talk with the group about the best way to move forward in a way everyone can enjoy. Work to create a supportive environment where players can admit to being uncomfortable without fearing that they're going to ruin everyone's fun. As DM, you can model this behavior by noting when you're shying away from a creepy idea that comes to you or thanking players who uphold the game's boundaries.": "一个典型的D&D会议比一部典型的恐怖电影要长，而且很难连续几个小时都保持这种气氛。计划在游戏过程中进行休息，并鼓励玩家在需要时离开桌子。如果你觉得游戏变得很激烈，或者出现了某人不喜欢的转折，在继续之前问一下，\"大家对继续游戏感到满意吗？\"。如果有人不同意，就感谢玩家的诚实，并加快游戏的进程，使之成为悬念。在下一个游戏环节之前，与小组讨论以每个人都能享受的方式前进的最佳方式。努力创造一个支持性的环境，让玩家可以承认自己的不舒服，而不用担心他们会破坏大家的乐趣。作为管理人，你可以通过注意到你何时对出现在你面前的令人毛骨悚然的想法退避三舍，或者感谢那些坚持游戏界限的玩家来示范这种行为。",
	"Beyond impromptu checks, once during a session, after a scheduled break, check in with the group and consider asking the following questions:": "除了即兴检查外，在会议期间，在预定的休息时间后，有一次与小组进行检查，并考虑提出以下问题。",
	"What do your characters hope will happen?": "你的角色希望会发生什么？",
	"What do your characters worry might happen?": "你的角色担心会发生什么？",
	"Do you want to update any content boundaries?": "你想更新任何内容的界限吗？",
	"Is there anything that would make the game more enjoyable for you?": "有什么东西可以让你的游戏更愉快吗？",
	"Beyond rules considerations, some actions also require special consideration before they occur in game, such as these examples: romance between characters, violence between characters, one player's character influencing or controlling another player's character, and yelling. All players (including the DM) must ask and gain permission from everyone playing—not just the affected players—before introducing this content. Without any explanation or debate, if a single person gives a thumbs down or doesn't respond, this action shouldn't be performed. Players may change their minds at any time. If a topic was listed as a boundary, it is off the table entirely.": "除了规则方面的考虑，有些行为在游戏中发生之前也需要特别考虑，比如这些例子：角色之间的恋爱，角色之间的暴力，一个玩家的角色影响或控制另一个玩家的角色，以及吼叫。所有玩家（包括DM）在引入这些内容之前，必须询问并获得所有游戏者的许可--不仅仅是受影响的玩家。在没有任何解释或辩论的情况下，如果有一个人竖起了大拇指，或者没有回应，这个动作就不应该执行。玩家可以在任何时候改变他们的想法。如果一个话题被列为边界，那么它就完全不在桌面上。",
	"Content tools enable you and your players to adjust the game's content as you play. Since D&D is improvisational, the game can go in unexpected directions. If a direction makes the game a worse experience for anyone, use these tools to correct course.": "内容工具使您和您的玩家能够在游戏过程中调整游戏的内容。由于D&D是即兴的，所以游戏可以向意想不到的方向发展。如果某个方向使游戏对任何人来说都是一种更糟糕的体验，请使用这些工具来纠正方向。",
	"Many content tools exist, but a popular one involves passing a blank note card to each participant, (including the DM) and instructing everyone to draw an X on their card. One uses their X-Card to signal to everyone else in the game that a boundary has been crossed. If you are playing remotely, players can lift the X to the camera, type X in a chat window, or cross their arms to form an X. In any case, this is a sign that something that just happened is off limits. The person touching the card can comment on what they want adjusted, or whoever's narrating the scene can walk back what just happened, try something else, or leave the scene with a vague ending (like in a film where things fade to black). The person using the content tool doesn't have to explain why the content is objectionable, nor should anyone question it. Instead of a debate, thank the person for being honest about their needs and move on.": "有许多内容的工具，但一个流行的工具是把一张空白的便条卡传给每个参与者，（包括管理员）并指示每个人在他们的卡片上画一个X。一个人用他们的X卡向游戏中的其他人发出信号，表示已经越过了一个界限。如果你是远程游戏，玩家可以对着摄像头举起X，在聊天窗口中输入X，或者交叉双臂形成一个X。触摸卡片的人可以评论他们想要调整的内容，或者不管是谁在叙述场景，都可以把刚刚发生的事情带回去，尝试其他的东西，或者给场景留下一个模糊的结局（就像电影中的事情渐渐变黑）。使用内容工具的人不必解释为什么内容令人反感，也不应该有人质疑它。与其进行辩论，不如感谢对方诚实地说明自己的需求，然后继续前进。",
	"Make it clear to players that if a person doesn't feel comfortable using a content tool, they can wait for a break to check in or talk to you privately. Players may also give a friend permission to use the card on their behalf. As the DM, lead by example. Treat content tools seriously and use them to adjust how your shared story plays out.": "向玩家明确表示，如果一个人对使用内容工具感到不舒服，可以等待休息时间来检查，或与你私下交谈。玩家也可以允许朋友代表他们使用该卡。作为管理员，以身作则。认真对待内容工具，并利用它们来调整你的共享故事的发展。",
	"If players seem disengaged, check in with them. Ask them what they would like to see happen next. If they don't know, write two or three options down, hand them the options privately, and ask them to choose one. If issues remain, call for a break, and privately ask what you can do to make the game more engaging.": "如果玩家看起来不感兴趣，就向他们了解情况。问他们接下来想看到什么。如果他们不知道，就写下两到三个选项，私下里把这些选项交给他们，让他们选择一个。如果问题仍然存在，就要求休息，并私下询问你能做些什么来使游戏更有吸引力。",
	"It's always a good idea to check in with players at the end of a session, but this rings especially true for adventures where tensions run high and the stories can elicit strong emotional responses. At the end of a horror game session, leave time to check in with players and ask them how the game went, how they're feeling, and what they liked about the session. You might ask the following questions:": "在会议结束时向玩家汇报情况总是一个好主意，但这对那些紧张的、故事会引起强烈情绪反应的冒险来说尤其如此。在恐怖游戏环节结束时，留出时间与玩家进行沟通，问他们游戏进行得如何，他们的感觉如何，以及他们喜欢这个环节的什么。你可以问以下问题。",
	"What unsolved mysteries do you want answers to?": "你想知道哪些未解之谜的答案？",
	"Did you find anything confusing or off-putting?": "你有没有发现任何令人困惑或反感的地方？",
	"What are you looking forward to in the next session?": "你对下一届会议有什么期待？",
	"These answers can help you craft the next session to create a game your players enjoy.": "这些答案可以帮助你精心设计下一个环节，创造一个你的玩家喜欢的游戏。",
	"If players give short or vague answers or you suspect that trust at the table has been broken, try creating an anonymous space to receive feedback. It's important to hear honest feedback from players so you can ensure everyone is fully immersed in the story and you can address any issues that might prevent them from enjoying the next game session.": "如果玩家给出了简短或模糊的答案，或者你怀疑桌子上的信任被破坏了，可以尝试创建一个匿名空间来接受反馈。听取玩家的诚实反馈很重要，这样你可以确保每个人都完全沉浸在故事中，你可以解决任何可能妨碍他们享受下一次游戏环节的问题。",
	"Ravenloft has a tradition of adventures featuring setting-specific props and memorable, set-piece encounters.

	"In both 1983's adventure {@i Ravenloft} and 2016's adventure {@adventure Curse of Strahd|CoS}, the plot changes in accordance with cards drawn from a tarokka deck.

	"The ten cards of this suit symbolize aggression and violence.": "这套牌的十张牌象征着侵略性和暴力。",
	"Tarokka decks allow you run encounters where fortune-tellers predict characters' fates. Once you're familiar with the cards and their meanings, you can interpret them in ways that tie in to the characters' pasts or events in your adventures. You can also use the results of tarokka readings to guide your campaign and make sure predictions come to pass.": "Tarokka牌允许你在算命先生预测人物命运的情况下进行遭遇战。一旦你熟悉了这些牌和它们的含义，你就可以用与人物的过去或冒险中的事件相联系的方式来解释它们。你也可以用塔罗卡的读数结果来指导你的活动，并确保预言成真。",
	"Spirit boards are tools to contact and divine the will of spirits or other mysterious forces. Upon placing their fingertips on a planchette set atop the board, assembled users feel forces move the planchette toward letters and symbols, gradually revealing a cryptic message. The spirits boards common in the Land of the Mists were first created by members of the {@book Keepers of the Feather|VRGR|3|Keepers of the Feather} (see {@book chapter 3|VRGR|3}), and feature half-understood images from their occult studies and Barovian lore. These markings include symbols from the tarokka deck, which carry the same meanings as they do upon those cards. All manner of mysterious beings consider a spirit board's use an invitation to communicate with the living, resulting in messages shared from beyond the grave and frightful revelations.": "灵板是接触和占卜神灵或其他神秘力量的意志的工具。将指尖放在板子上的刨花上，集合在一起的使用者会感觉到有一种力量将刨花向字母和符号移动，逐渐显示出一个神秘的信息。迷雾之地常见的精神板最早是由{@book Keepers of the Feather|VRGR|3|Keepers of the Feather}(见{@book chapter 3|VRGR|3})的成员创造的，并以他们的神秘学研究和巴罗维亚传说中的半懂不懂的图像为特色。这些标记包括来自塔罗卡牌的符号，这些符号的含义与这些牌上的符号相同。各种各样的神秘生物都认为灵牌的使用是一种与活人交流的邀请，导致从坟墓之外分享信息和可怕的启示。",

These curses provide ominously poetic responses to fateful choices and afflictions that last until they're alleviated by specific remedies. Spells at the characters' disposal might relieve these curses' effects temporarily but can't lift them completely. The price must be paid.": "本节为创造戏剧性的诅咒提供指导，这些诅咒既可以与魔法、怪物的行为或其他效果产生的诅咒相区别，也可以作为其一部分。这些诅咒对宿命的选择和痛苦提供了不祥的诗意回应，并持续到它们被特定的补救措施所缓解。人物所掌握的法术可能会暂时缓解这些诅咒的影响，但不能完全解除它们。必须付出代价。",
	"Curses aren't something to throw around lightly. They should be dramatically appropriate responses to meaningful choices characters make. If every goblin or bandit coughs out a dying curse, the narrative impact fades. There should always be a way to avoid a curse, and a curse's effects should clearly arise from wrongdoing. Here are some examples of actions that warrant a curse:": "诅咒不是可以随便乱扔的东西。它们应该是对角色所做的有意义的选择的戏剧性的适当反应。如果每个地精或强盗都咳出一个垂死的诅咒，那么叙述的影响就会消失。应该总是有办法避免诅咒，而且诅咒的影响应该明显地来自于错误的行为。下面是一些需要诅咒的行为的例子。",

	"Stealing a treasure that is meaningful to an entire culture": "窃取对整个文化有意义的宝藏",
	"Most curses have three distinct components: pronouncement, burden, and resolution. Whatever form these take, at least one of them, especially the burden or resolution, should have an ironic connection to the action that triggered the curse.": "大多数诅咒有三个不同的组成部分：宣告、负担和解决。无论采取什么形式，其中至少有一个，特别是负担或决议，应该与触发诅咒的行为有讽刺性的联系。",
	"The first component of a curse is the pronouncement, which amounts to a threat. It promises suffering to those who dare to perform or have already performed a specific offensive act. The pronouncement can be a standing warning against taking some action, or it could be a declaration in the moment. The following examples suggest just a few possible pronouncements:": "诅咒的第一个组成部分是宣告，这相当于一种威胁。它承诺给那些敢于或已经实施特定攻击性行为的人带来痛苦。宣告可以是对采取某种行动的长期警告，也可以是当下的声明。下面的例子只是提出了几种可能的宣告。",
	"A widely spread story explaining that a particular action tempts terrible punishment": "一个广为流传的故事，解释说某一特定行为会诱发可怕的惩罚",

	"Swearing a vow to refrain from or undertake some action on pain of great suffering": "发誓不采取或采取某种行动，以免遭受巨大的痛苦",
	"A curse's burden is the effect that causes hardship and suffering to the curse's victim. A burden is often reflective of what caused the curse in the first place, twisting the transgressor's action against them. The burden takes effect immediately, along with a vague sense of foreboding—such as a chill down the spine or a wave of nausea. The victim might not notice the curse's effect until a situation arises to make it obvious. For example, a character cursed with clumsiness that manifests as disadvantage on Dexterity checks might not notice anything until they make such a check. Burdens can take many forms, such as the following:": "诅咒的负担是给诅咒的受害者造成困难和痛苦的影响。负担往往反映了最初导致诅咒的原因，扭曲了违反者对他们的行动。负担立即生效，伴随着一种模糊的预感--例如脊柱发凉或一阵恶心。受害者可能不会注意到诅咒的效果，直到出现了一个明显的情况。例如，一个被诅咒为笨拙的角色，表现为在灵巧检查中处于劣势，在他们进行这种检查之前，可能不会注意到什么。负担可以有很多形式，比如说以下几种。",
	"The victim has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, or some combination of the three. This can be tied to a single ability score or applied generally.": "受害者在攻击卷轴、能力检查、蓄力投掷或三者的某种组合中处于不利地位。这可以与单一的能力得分联系起来，也可以普遍适用。",

	"The victim's Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score is reduced to 3, and the victim can't be raised from the dead while the curse lasts.": "受害者的力量、灵巧或体质得分减少到3分，并且在诅咒持续期间，受害者不能起死回生。",
	"A monster hunts the victim relentlessly. Even if the monster dies, it rises again or a new one takes its place 24 hours later.": "一个怪物无情地追杀受害者。即使怪物死了，它也会再次复活，或者24小时后有新的怪物取代它的位置。",
	"Sometimes a curse can be ended by making restitution to a wronged party (or their closest kin in the case of a death) or reparation if something was stolen or destroyed. The resolution might be declared as part of the pronouncement, or it may be left to those who suffer the curse to make amends on their own. Research and divination can offer clues or even reveal the exact steps needed to resolve the curse.": "有时，诅咒可以通过向受伤害的一方（如果是死亡，则为其最亲近的亲属）进行赔偿来结束，如果有东西被盗或被毁，则进行补偿。该决议可能被宣布为宣判的一部分，也可能留给遭受诅咒的人自己去弥补。研究和占卜可以提供线索，甚至揭示解决诅咒所需的确切步骤。",
	"While more general curses can lifted by a {@spell remove curse} spell, more specific or dramatic curses can't be permanently lifted through spells. Magic can offer temporary respite, though. A {@spell remove curse} spell cast on the victim of such a curse suppresses the burden for 1 hour. A {@spell greater restoration} spell suppresses the burden until the victim finishes a long rest. Death usually ends a curse, but the curse returns in full force if the cursed character returns to life without resolving the curse.": "虽然更一般的诅咒可以通过{@spell remove curse}的法术来解除，但更具体或戏剧性的诅咒不能通过法术来永久解除。不过，魔法可以提供暂时的喘息机会。对这种诅咒的受害者施以{@spell remove curse}的法术，可以抑制1小时的负担。一个{@spell greater restoration}的咒语可以抑制负担，直到受害者完成一个长时间的休息。死亡通常会结束诅咒，但是如果被诅咒的人物在没有解除诅咒的情况下恢复了生命，那么诅咒就会完全恢复效力。",
	"When a curse is resolved, its effects usually end immediately. Some more insidious curses might linger beyond the resolution but can then be removed by a {@spell remove curse} spell or similar magic if the victim succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw when the spell is cast. If the save fails, it can be repeated after a specific interval passes, usually 1 month, with the curse ending on a successful save. Adjust the DC of a particularly weak curse to 10 or that of a stronger one to 20.": "当一个诅咒被解决时，它的影响通常会立即结束。一些更阴险的诅咒可能会在解决之后继续存在，但是如果受害者在施法时成功地进行了DC15魅力救赎，那么就可以通过{@spell remove curse}法术或类似的魔法来消除。如果救赎失败，可以在一个特定的时间间隔后重复，通常是1个月，救赎成功后诅咒就会结束。将一个特别弱的诅咒的DC调整为10，或者将一个更强的诅咒的DC调整为20。",

You can scale this curse for lower- and higher-level characters by choosing another kind of creature.": "每个获得诅咒的角色都会被一个{@creature wraith}追杀，它在日落时出现，在黎明时消失，一心一意地追求杀死被诅咒者的目标。缠绕者会出现在离受害者30英尺内的一个无人空间。摧毁缠身者可以获得暂时的缓和；它在10天内不会再出现。你可以为低级和高级的角色选择另一种生物来扩展这个诅咒。",

	"A monster is more frightening when its reputation precedes it.": "当一个怪物的名声在外时，它就更令人恐惧了。",
	"Give yourself permission to dwell on a monster's description.": "允许自己纠缠在怪物的描述上。",
	"Monsters that fight dirty—or in a particularly fearsome way—have more impact.": "那些打得很脏的怪物--或者以特别可怕的方式--有更大的影响。",
	"Simple tweaks to a monster's stat block can enhance its horror.": "对怪物的状态块进行简单的调整可以增强其恐怖性。",
	"Simple traits can reflect a monster's relationship to the evil master it serves.": "简单的特征可以反映出一个怪物与它所服务的邪恶主人的关系。",
	"For significant adversaries, use the tables in the \"{@book Genres of Horror|VRGR|2}\" section of {@book chapter 2|VRGR|2} to inspire you as you craft a monster's unique details. When it comes time for the final confrontation, it might not matter whether the bridge-haunting merrow was the product of an amoral experiment to infuse piscine traits into a soldier or the result of someone drinking from a spring tainted by demon's blood; the merrow's stat block remains the same. But those different origin stories suggest completely different paths for adventurers to follow when investigating the creature and ensuring nothing like it ever returns to be a menace again.": "对于重要的对手，在你制作怪物的独特细节时，可以使用{@book chapter 2|VRGR|2}的\"{@book Genres of Horror|VRGR|2} \"部分中的表格来启发你。当到了最后对抗的时候，不管这个在桥上徘徊的乌鸦是一个不道德的实验的产物，把鱼的特性注入到一个士兵身上，还是有人喝了被恶魔之血污染的泉水；乌鸦的状态块都是一样的，这可能并不重要。但这些不同的起源故事为冒险者在调查该生物时提供了完全不同的路径，以确保没有类似的东西再回来成为威胁。",
	"Every monster tells a story. The more you treat monsters as unique individuals and foreshadow their threat, the larger they'll loom in characters' minds. Build dread by giving monsters reputations that suggests their form, deeds, or peculiarities while letting players' imaginations embellish details.": "每个怪物都在讲述一个故事。你越是把怪物当作独特的个体，并预示它们的威胁，它们就会在角色的脑海中占据更大的位置。通过赋予怪物声誉，暗示它们的形态、行为或特殊性，同时让玩家的想象力来美化细节，从而建立恐惧感。",
	"For example, tales describe a horrifying skeletal figure that corrupts the land wherever it walks. Its habit of whistling cheerfully while committing brutal acts is the source of its epithet: the Whistling Fiend. Characters might hear rumors of its merry tunes becoming fearful earworms for those who survive its passing. A party seeking the monster might also hear the whistling long before they confront the fiend. All that time, they can at guess at their enemy's nature, but ultimately the Whistling Fiend might be any demon or other threat you choose.": "例如，传说中描述了一个可怕的骷髅头，无论它走到哪里都会腐蚀土地。它的习惯是一边吹着欢快的口哨，一边实施残暴的行为，这就是它的绰号：吹口哨的恶魔。角色们可能会听到关于它欢快的曲调成为那些从它身边经过的人的恐惧的耳虫的传闻。寻找这个怪物的队伍在面对这个怪物之前很久，也可能听到口哨声。在这段时间里，他们可以猜测敌人的本性，但最终口哨魔可能是你选择的任何恶魔或其他威胁。",
	"The Whistling Fiend's notoriety has little to do with its stat block. It's famous because of its habit of whistling amid acts of terrible carnage. Use the tables in {@book chapter 4|DMG|4|Detailed NPCs} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to help inspire similar characteristics to color a monster's notorious reputation.": "哨子魔的恶名与它的属性块没有什么关系。它之所以出名，是因为它有在可怕的屠杀行为中吹口哨的习惯。使用{@book chapter 4|DMG|4|Detailed NPCs}中的表格来帮助激发类似的特征，为怪物的恶名着色。",
	"Focus on the features that make the creature alien, inhuman, and out of place. The Whistling Fiend looks like a humanoid skeleton dripping its own gelatinous musculature. Its skull curves to a point suggestive of a sickle.": "重点放在使生物变得异乎寻常、非人类和不合群的特征上。呼啸的恶魔看起来像一个人形的骨架，滴着自己的胶状肌肉组织。它的头骨弯成一个点，让人联想到一把镰刀。",
	"Describe elements of the creature that are likely to provoke a visceral response, such as the smell of rot that its oily flesh exudes, the whistled tune of a well-known nursery rhyme issuing from its lipless mouth, and the unnatural heat that forms ripples in the air around it. These details don't need to rely on grotesque descriptions. Sometimes it's a contrast between mundane and terrifying details that stands out, like a monster's soulful eyes or pearly teeth set amid vicious features.": "描述该生物可能引起内脏反应的元素，如其油腻的肉体所散发的腐烂气味，从其无唇的嘴里发出的知名童谣的口哨声，以及在其周围空气中形成涟漪的非自然的热量。这些细节不需要依靠怪诞的描述。有时，世俗和恐怖的细节之间的对比才是最突出的，比如一个怪物深情的眼睛或镶嵌在凶恶特征中的珍珠般的牙齿。",
	"There's a fine line here: Don't dictate a character's actions in response to what they see. But you can touch on the feelings that the creature provokes, leaving it up to the players to describe how they respond to those feelings. Your gut twists in revulsion. The acrid air stings your nostrils. You're suddenly aware of how small and hollow your dreams are in a world that can spawn beings of pure evil.": "这里有一条细线。不要指使角色对他们所看到的东西做出反应的行动。但是你可以触及这个生物所引起的感觉，让玩家来描述他们如何应对这些感觉。你的内脏在反感中扭曲。刺鼻的空气刺痛你的鼻孔。你突然意识到，在一个可以产生纯粹邪恶的生物的世界里，你的梦想是多么渺小和空洞。",
	"Monsters, just like player characters, can try anything you can imagine in combat, including the full range of combat options described in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}. Monsters can use the {@action Help} action to aid each other, they can grapple or shove their enemies, and so on. Some monsters use these options to maximize their advantages in battle; others use them to sow fear among their enemies, even if they're not strategically optimal choices.": "怪物，就像玩家角色一样，可以在战斗中尝试任何你能想到的东西，包括{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中描述的全部战斗选项。怪物可以使用{@action Help}动作来互相帮助，它们可以抓取或推搡它们的敌人，诸如此类。一些怪物使用这些选项来最大化它们在战斗中的优势；另一些怪物则使用它们来在敌人中散播恐惧，即使它们在战略上不是最佳选择。",
	"For example, creatures known as \"goblyns\" in {@book Kartakass|VRGR|3} and other domains are ordinary {@creature Hobgoblin||hobgoblins} in terms of their game statistics, but they're known for a tactic they call \"feasting\": they grapple their enemies and then make unarmed attacks to bite their faces. These attacks aren't terribly dangerous (a hobgoblin's unarmed strike deals only 2 damage, compared to the average of 5 it deals with a longsword), but the face-biting is much more shocking to the victim and onlookers.": "例如，在{@book Kartakass|VRGR|3}和其他领域中被称为 \"妖精 \"的生物，就其游戏统计数据而言是普通的{@creature Hobgoblin||hobgoblins}，但它们以一种被称为 \"盛宴 \"的战术而闻名：它们抓住敌人，然后进行徒手攻击，咬住敌人的脸。这些攻击并不十分危险（一个妖精的徒手攻击只造成2点伤害，而长剑的平均伤害为5点），但咬脸对受害者和旁观者来说要震撼得多。",
	"Consider undermining players' expectations about what a creature is or can do by making tweaks to the traits in its stat block. Adding a {@creature Sahuagin||sahuagin's} Blood Frenzy trait to a different monster can help it feel like a bloodthirsty horror, for example. Traits such as a {@creature Troglodyte||troglodyte's} Chameleon Skin or a {@creature Doppelganger||doppelganger's} Ambusher can help make a monster feel more sinister as it lurks in hiding and ambushes its foes. Some traits, such as a {@creature Night Hag||night hag's} Etherealness or an {@creature Imp||imp's} Invisibility, can help a monster escape from an encounter so it can return to haunt the adventurers another day. Traits such as a {@creature Banshee||banshee's} Horrifying Visage or a black dragon's Frightful Presence can heighten the inherent fearsomeness of truly terrifying creatures.": "考虑削弱玩家对生物是什么或能做什么的期望，对其状态块中的特性进行调整。例如，给一个不同的怪物添加一个{@creature Sahuagin||sahuagin's}血腥狂热的特性，可以帮助它感觉像一个嗜血的恐怖。诸如{@creature Troglodyte||troglodyte's}变色龙皮肤或{@creature Doppelganger||doppelganger's}伏击者的特性可以帮助使怪物在潜伏和伏击敌人时感觉更阴险。有些特性，例如{@creature Night Hag||night hag's}虚无缥缈或{@creature Imp||imp's}隐身，可以帮助怪物从遭遇战中逃脱，这样它就可以在另一天回到冒险者的身边。诸如{@creature Banshee||banshee's}恐怖的面容或黑龙的可怕存在等特性，可以提高真正可怕的生物的内在恐惧性。",
	"Of course, you're not limited to the traits that appear in existing monster stat blocks, but those are a good starting point. Feel free to invent your own.": "当然，你并不局限于出现在现有怪物状态块中的特征，但这些特征是一个很好的起点。请自由地发明你自己的特性。",
	"In the Land of the Mists, many monsters serve as minions or manifestations of more powerful villains. To reflect a minion's relationship to its Darklord master or other sinister forces, add one or more of these traits to a monster's stat block.": "在迷雾之地，许多怪物都是更强大的恶棍的爪牙或表现形式。为了反映一个爪牙与它的黑暗领主主人或其他邪恶势力的关系，可以在怪物的状态块中添加一个或多个这样的特征。",
	"The minion can't be compelled to act in a way contrary to its master's instructions.": "奴才不能被强迫以违背主人指示的方式行事。",
	"When the minion dies, its master regains hit points equal to four times the minion's challenge rating, as long as the master is within 100 feet of it.": "当爪牙死亡时，只要主人在它的100英尺范围内，它的主人就会重新获得相当于爪牙挑战等级4倍的打击点数。",
	"When an attack hits its master and the minion is within 5 feet of its master, the minion can use its reaction to make the attack hit itself instead.": "当一次攻击击中它的主人，而奴才在它主人的5英尺范围内，奴才可以用它的反应来使攻击击中自己。",
	"The minion and its master can communicate telepathically with each other, as long as they are on the same plane of existence.": "奴才和它的主人可以用心灵感应互相交流，只要他们在同一个存在平面。",
	"Once you've considered the techniques in this section, put them all together to create your own unique terror. If you have ideas about what you want your monster to do, write them down. Then think of what stories connect the pieces you want to use or fill in gaps you don't know about yet.": "一旦你考虑了本节中的技巧，就把它们放在一起，创造你自己独特的恐怖。如果你有关于你想让你的怪物做什么的想法，就把它们写下来。然后想一想，用什么故事来连接你想用的片段，或者填补你还不知道的空白。",
	"{@creature The Bagman|VRGR} is an urban legend about an adventurer who sought to escape doom by abandoning his party and hiding inside a {@item bag of holding}. When he tried to leave, though, he became lost amid a constantly increasing number of extradimensional storage spaces. Over time, the strange forces of this magical in-between place transformed the adventurer into a monstrous creature. Now, every night, {@creature the Bagman|VRGR} slips out from a random {@item bag of holding}. If he doesn't find his home, he drags someone back into the bag with him and leaves behind some trinket from his hidden kingdom of lost junk. Some say that if you speak too loudly over an open {@item bag of holding} or whisper \"follow my voice\" into a magical storage space three times, {@creature the Bagman|VRGR} will come for you.": "{@creature The Bagman|VRGR}是一个都市传说，说的是一个冒险家为了逃避厄运，抛弃了他的队伍，躲进了一个{@item bag of holding}。然而，当他试图离开时，他在不断增加的次元存储空间中迷路了。随着时间的推移，这个神奇的中间地带的奇怪力量把这个冒险家变成了一个畸形的生物。现在，每天晚上，{@creature the Bagman|VRGR}从一个随机的{@item bag of holding}中溜出来。如果他没有找到自己的家，他就会把某人拖回包里，并从他隐藏的失落的垃圾王国里留下一些小玩意。有人说，如果你在一个开放的{@item bag of holding}空间里说话太大声，或者在一个神奇的储存空间里小声说 \"跟着我的声音走 \"三次，{@creature the Bagman|VRGR}就会来找你。",
	"Any character might know the story of {@creature the Bagman|VRGR}. What {@creature the Bagman|VRGR} is and how you use this urban legend is up to you.

Is {@creature the Bagman|VRGR} just a monster that preys on adventurers, or is he the Darklord of his own hidden domain? The possibilities for horror adventures are endless, and nowhere—especially not adventurers' gear—is safe.": "任何角色都可能知道{@creature the Bagman|VRGR}的故事。{@creature the Bagman|VRGR}是什么，以及你如何使用这个城市传说，取决于你。是否真的有一个袋鼠，或者他只是一个故事？如果一件物品在一夜之间消失了，或者有人在{@item bag of holding}中发现了不属于他们的东西，{@creature the Bagman|VRGR}是否应该受到责备？{@creature the Bagman|VRGR}只是一个捕食冒险者的怪物，还是他是他自己隐藏领域的黑暗主宰？恐怖冒险的可能性是无穷无尽的，没有任何地方--特别是冒险者的装备--是安全的。",
	"Many terrors lurk in the shadows—some in the corner of perception, and others beyond the Material Plane. This chapter presents stat blocks for a host of threats that can play a role in horror-based campaigns.": "许多恐怖的东西潜伏在阴影中--有些在感知的角落里，有些则在物质世界之外。本章介绍了在基于恐怖的战役中可以发挥作用的大量威胁的状态块。",
