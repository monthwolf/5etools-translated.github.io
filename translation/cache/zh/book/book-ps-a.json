	"This whole Plane Shift thing started because of Zendikar. It's hard to imagine a Magic plane better suited for D&D adventuring than the one that was conceived, from start to finish, as \"adventure world.\" Making the transition from The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Zendikar to Plane Shift: Zendikar was thus perfectly natural. Innistrad came next, bolstered by the happy coincidence of the Curse of Strahd adventure coming out close to the same time. Then with Plane Shift: Kaladesh, I got to stray a little further from the core D&D experience, presenting a fairly fast and loose take on reskinning D&D magic items into the aether-powered inventions of Kaladesh. And now we come to Amonkhet—a desert plane inspired by ancient Egypt, ruled by an evil dragon Planeswalker, and which features one small safe haven from an undead infestation. It is not a traditional D&D setting. The trials of the five gods provide the most obvious structure for a campaign set on Amonkhet. A group of initiates from the same crop might go through the trials together, and those trials alone could form the entirety of a short campaign. To flesh out the experience, characters could also undertake missions on the behalf of gods or viziers: defending the Hekma, joining the gods on a hunting expedition in the desert, and so on. The campaign could get complicated with the addition of viziers, who normally do not go through the trials (unless they choose to), or if any or all of the characters become dissenters. Perhaps the best way to think of an Amonkhet campaign is that it takes place against the backdrop of the five trials, rather than being all about the trials. The trials provide a structure and a sense of drama, but relationships among characters—and between characters and the rest of the world—are where the meat of the story unfolds. You could set your campaign in the period leading up to when initiate player characters undergo one of the trials, with the trial as a climax to the whole story. You could use the Trial of Solidarity and the Trial of Ambition as a framing device for the campaign, to explore issues of collective unity versus personal achievement. (Initiate characters would undergo the Trials of Knowledge and Strength on their own terms.) Or you could ignore the trials entirely and focus on dissenter characters trying to upset the social order of Naktamun. As always, The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Amonkhet is the definitive resource for information about the plane. With this document, you can use that information to build a campaign with a minimum of changes to the fifth edition D&D rules, which you can find here. And even without the book, you can find lore about Amonkhet on the Magic web site. Good luck in the trials!": "整个位面转换的事情是因赞迪卡而起的。很难想象有哪个魔法位面比这个从头到尾都被设想为 \"冒险世界 \"的位面更适合D&D的冒险活动。从《魔法的艺术：集会-赞迪卡》过渡到《空间转移》。因此，从《魔法：集会-赞迪卡》过渡到《空间转换：赞迪卡》是非常自然的。接下来是Innistrad，这是因为Strahd的诅咒冒险在同一时间推出，这是个很好的巧合。然后是 \"空间转移\"。Kaladesh时，我又偏离了D&D的核心经验，将D&D的魔法物品改头换面成了Kaladesh的乙太动力发明，呈现出一种相当快速和松散的方式。现在我们来到了阿蒙凯特--一个受古埃及启发的沙漠平面，由一个邪恶的龙行者统治，它的特点是有一个小的安全避难所，不受亡灵侵扰。这不是一个传统的D&D背景。五神的考验为阿蒙凯特的活动提供了最明显的结构。一群来自同一作物的新成员可能会一起经历试炼，而这些试炼本身就可以构成一个短期活动的全部内容。为了充实经验，人物还可以代表神或大臣执行任务：保卫赫克马，加入神在沙漠中的狩猎探险，等等。如果增加了宰相，活动就会变得复杂起来，因为宰相通常不经历试炼（除非他们选择），或者如果任何或所有角色都成为异议者。也许对阿蒙凯特战役最好的看法是，它发生在五个审判的背景下，而不是全部关于审判。审判提供了一个结构和一种戏剧感，但是人物之间的关系--以及人物与世界其他地方的关系--才是故事展开的关键所在。你可以把你的战役设置在启动玩家角色接受其中一个试验之前的阶段，把试验作为整个故事的高潮。你可以用 \"团结的考验 \"和 \"野心的考验 \"作为活动的框架装置，来探讨集体团结与个人成就的问题。(初始角色将根据自己的条件接受知识和力量的考验）。你也可以完全不考虑试炼，而把重点放在试图破坏纳克塔蒙社会秩序的异议人物上。一如既往，《魔法：集会的艺术--阿蒙凯特》是关于这个平面的权威信息资源。有了这份文件，你就可以利用这些信息来建立一个活动，只需对第五版D&D规则进行最少的修改，你可以在这里找到这些规则。即使没有这本书，你也可以在魔法网站上找到关于阿蒙凯特的传说。祝你在试验中好运!",
	"Towering, gold-encrusted monuments break the unending monotony of a horizon formed of sun-blasted sand. Awe-inspiring, animal-headed gods walk among the people, offering them care and protection from the horrors of the desert. A wide, life-giving river offers its abundant bounty, providing for every physical need. Happy, hopeful people offer sacrifices in grand temples dedicated to their benevolent gods, addressing their spiritual needs. For they know that this life, as wonderful as it might be, is just the beginning—a prelude to the perfection that awaits them in the afterlife, promised to them by their God-Pharaoh.": "高耸的镶金纪念碑打破了由阳光照射的沙子形成的地平线的无休止的单调。令人敬畏的兽头神走在人们中间，为他们提供照顾和保护，使他们免受沙漠的恐怖之苦。一条宽阔的、赋予生命的河流提供了它丰富的赏赐，满足了每一个人的生理需求。幸福而充满希望的人们在宏伟的寺庙中为他们仁慈的神灵献上祭品，满足他们的精神需求。因为他们知道，这种生活，尽管可能是美好的，但只是一个开始--在来世等待他们的完美的前奏，这是由他们的神--法老承诺的。",
	"Amonkhet is a plane of dichotomy. Beyond the lush river valley spreads endless scorching desert. Accursed, desiccated mummies roam that desert, while carefully embalmed mummies attend to the needs of the living in the glorious city-state. The people have everything they need. They are protected from the desert heat and wandering mummies by the magical barrier called the Hekma, and they spend their lives in focused training, honing body and mind to perfection. Yet they eagerly anticipate the time when they will be permitted to die in combat and leave this world behind.": "阿蒙凯特是一个二分法的平面。在郁郁葱葱的河谷之外，蔓延着无尽的炙热沙漠。被诅咒的、干枯的木乃伊在沙漠中游荡，而精心防腐的木乃伊则在这个光荣的城邦中满足生活的需要。人们拥有他们需要的一切。他们被称为 \"海克玛 \"的神奇屏障保护着，不受沙漠高温和游荡木乃伊的影响，他们一生都在集中训练，将身体和心灵磨练得完美无缺。然而，他们急切地期待着他们被允许在战斗中死亡并离开这个世界的时候。",
	"On the surface, Amonkhet seems like a marvelous place to live. But something unsettling and nefarious lurks behind the grand facade. The wise and benevolent God-Pharaoh, said to be busy preparing the wondrous afterlife for the worthy, is actually Nicol Bolas—the malevolent dragon Planeswalker whose schemes reach far beyond this plane. And all the preparation and training, all the trials and contests, all the effort to be made worthy—all of this is meant to prepare the people of Amonkhet for transformation into an undead army under Bolas's command.": "从表面上看，阿蒙凯特似乎是一个令人惊叹的生活场所。但在这个宏伟的外表下，却潜伏着一些令人不安和邪恶的东西。智慧和仁慈的神-法老，据说正忙着为有价值的人准备奇妙的来世，实际上是尼科尔-博拉斯--邪恶的龙行者，他的计划远远超出了这个平面。所有的准备和训练，所有的考验和竞赛，所有的努力都是为了让自己变得有价值--所有这些都是为了让阿蒙凯特的人们准备好在博拉斯的指挥下转变为一支亡灵军队。",
	"Unknown to any of the plane's inhabitants, the entire society of Amonkhet has been manipulated by Nicol Bolas, who has seized control of the world, the gods, and the magic of the plane. Bolas chose this plane for his schemes because of the presence of a magical substance called lazotep, which interacts with the magic of necromancy in strange and powerful ways. Conveniently, he also found here a pious, structured civilization that he could easily subvert to his own purposes. Making himself the God-Pharaoh, he brought the gods themselves under his control, and eliminated anyone who tried to stand against him. Then he transformed the world into a factory designed to produce a huge army of perfect undead soldiers—mummies embalmed in lazotep.": "这个星球上的任何居民都不知道，阿蒙凯特的整个社会已经被尼科尔-博拉斯操纵了，他已经控制了这个世界、诸神和这个星球的魔法。博拉斯为他的计划选择了这个平面，因为这里有一种叫做拉索特普的魔法物质，它能以奇怪而强大的方式与死灵魔法发生作用。方便的是，他还在这里发现了一个虔诚的、结构化的文明，他可以很容易地将其颠覆为自己的目的。他把自己变成了神-法老，把众神都置于他的控制之下，并消灭了任何试图反对他的人。然后他把世界变成了一个工厂，旨在生产一支巨大的完美的不死士兵军队--用拉索特普防腐的木乃伊。",
	"Adapting the peculiar magic of the plane, Bolas found a means to preserve the combat skills of the living after death. He has selected five aspects of character that he desires most in his undead soldiers, and has built the society of Amonkhet around a series of trials designed to hone and perfect those aspects of body and mind. Throughout their lives, the people of the plane believe they are drawing nearer to the promised afterlife—and at last they die in the final trial, a mass battle with no survivors. But rather than earning a place in the afterlife, they are instead embalmed in lazotep and stored in Bolas's great necropolis, adding to the ranks of his undead army.": "博拉斯利用这个星球上的特殊魔法，找到了一种在死后保留活人战斗技能的方法。他选择了他最渴望的亡灵士兵的五个方面的性格，并围绕一系列旨在磨练和完善这些方面的身体和心灵的试验建立了阿蒙凯特的社会。在他们的一生中，这个星球上的人们相信他们正在接近承诺的来世--最后他们在最后的试验中死去，这是一场没有幸存者的大规模战斗。但他们并没有在来世赢得一席之地，而是被埋在拉索特普中，存放在博拉斯的大墓园中，增加了他的亡灵大军的队伍。",
	"Part of the magic of Amonkhet that Bolas has been able to exploit is a necromantic phenomenon called the Curse of Wandering. This naturally occurring magic causes any being who dies on the plane to rise again after a short time, cursed with insatiable hunger and an irresistible drive to attack the living. Desiccated mummies created by the Curse of Wandering fill the desert wasteland that dominates the plane, constantly threatening what little life remains. But the people of Amonkhet do not fear the threat of attack as much as they dread the knowledge that all who live will one day die and fall under the same curse. Death under the effect of the Curse of Wandering is a terrifying afterlife filled with endless suffering.": "博拉斯能够利用的阿蒙凯特的部分魔力是一种叫做 \"流浪的诅咒 \"的亡灵现象。这种自然发生的魔法使任何死在这个星球上的人在短时间内复活，并被诅咒为贪得无厌的饥饿和不可抗拒的攻击生者的动力。由 \"流浪的诅咒 \"创造的干枯木乃伊充斥着主宰这个星球的沙漠荒地，不断威胁着仅存的生命。但阿蒙凯特的人们并不害怕攻击的威胁，他们更害怕知道所有活着的人有一天都会死去，并受到同样的诅咒。在 \"流浪的诅咒 \"作用下的死亡是一个可怕的来世，充满了无尽的痛苦。",
	"What God-Pharaoh Nicol Bolas offers to the people of Amonkhet is an alternative to an eternity of wandering: an afterlife of glorious delights. And all they need to do to attain this eternal bliss is prove that they are worthy. As such, the threat of the Curse of Wandering is a strong motivation for people to undergo the trials of devotion that the God-Pharaoh demands.": "神-法老尼科尔-博拉斯为阿蒙凯特的人们提供了一个替代永恒流浪的选择：一个充满光荣乐趣的来世。而他们需要做的就是证明他们是有价值的，才能获得这种永恒的幸福。因此，\"流浪的诅咒 \"的威胁是促使人们接受神-法老所要求的虔诚考验的强大动力。",
	"The inhabitants of Amonkhet, mortal and divine alike, believe that the God-Pharaoh left the five gods as stewards of the populace when he departed to prepare the afterlife. While he is gone, the God-Pharaoh expects the people to devote their lives to proving they are worthy of this great reward. Since the afterlife will be perfect, the people who enter it must also be perfect.": "阿蒙凯特的居民，无论是凡人还是神人，都相信神-法老在离开准备来世的时候，留下了五位神人作为民众的管家。在他离开的时候，神-法老希望人们能用自己的生命来证明他们配得上这个伟大的奖赏。由于来世将是完美的，进入来世的人也必须是完美的。",
	"The gods are custodians of the path to the afterlife, established by the God-Pharaoh to purify and perfect the people who follow that path and undergo its trials. Each god oversees one of five trials, instructing the initiates who prepare to face that trial by helping them cultivate one of the five aspects of mortal perfection.": "众神是通往来世之路的监护人，由神-法老建立，以净化和完善遵循这条道路并接受其考验的人。每位神监督五个试验中的一个，指导准备面对该试验的入门者，帮助他们培养凡人完美的五个方面中的一个。",
	"Oketra the True, the cat-headed god of solidarity, teaches that the worthy shall know and respect all others whom the God-Pharaoh deems as worthy. For in the afterlife, all will be together in purpose and in action.": "团结的猫头神奥克特拉教导说，有价值的人应了解并尊重所有被神-法老认为有价值的其他人。因为在来世，所有人都将在目标和行动上聚在一起。",
	"Kefnet the Mindful, the ibis-headed god of knowledge, teaches that the worthy shall cultivate a nimble mind—one capable of perceiving the wonders beyond imagining that await in the afterlife": "知识之神凯菲特（Kefnet the Mindful），朱鹭头的知识之神，教导有价值的人应培养一个灵活的头脑--能够感知来世等待的超乎想象的奇迹。",
	"Strength. Rhonas the Indomitable, the cobra-headed god of strength, teaches that the worthy shall hone a strong body that can endure throughout an endless life.": "力量。不屈不挠的罗纳斯，眼镜蛇头的力量之神，教导有价值的人应磨练出强壮的身体，使之能承受无尽的生命。",
	"Bontu the Glorified, the crocodile-headed god of ambition, teaches that the worthy shall strive for greatness, as supremacy will be rewarded in the afterlife.": "鳄鱼头的野心之神邦图（Bontu the Glorified）教导说，有价值的人应努力追求伟大，因为至高无上的地位将在来世得到回报。",
	"Hazoret the Fervent, the jackal-headed god of zeal, teaches that the worthy shall rush toward the afterlife with unhesitating fervor. Relentlessly, they will rise to overcome any obstacle in the way of earning a place at the God-Pharaoh's side.": "热情的哈佐雷特，豺狼头的热情之神，教导有价值的人应以毫不犹豫的热情冲向来世。他们将不遗余力地克服任何障碍，争取在神-法老身边获得一席之地。",
	"Initiates who pass one of the trials are awarded a cartouche—a magical emblem they will take with them to the afterlife. The trials culminate in the Trial of Zeal, which is a combat to the death. Dying in this final battle is proof of worthiness, with a glorified death earning the initiate a place in the afterlife. The bodies of the slain are loaded onto funerary barges and sent through the Gate to the Afterlife. But this is not an end. Rather, it marks the beginning of the most wondrous part of an initiate's existence. Each looks forward to death in the final trial, hoping to find a glorious end at the hand of a close friend, so that together, they can live as Eternals in the afterlife with the God-Pharaoh. Forever.": "通过其中一项试验的入门者会获得一个卡图什--一个他们将带着来世的魔法徽章。试验的高潮是狂热试验，这是一场生死搏斗。在这场最后的战斗中死亡是价值的证明，光荣的死亡将为入门者在来世赢得一席之地。被杀者的尸体被装入殡仪馆的驳船，并被送入来世之门。但这并不是一个结束。相反，它标志着入门者存在中最奇妙的部分的开始。每个人都期待着在最后的审判中死亡，希望在一个亲密的朋友手中找到一个光荣的结局，这样他们就可以一起作为永恒的人在来世与神-法老一起生活。永远。",
	"The citizens of Amonkhet begin training for the trials of the five gods at a very young age. Children as young as five years old are invited to become acolytes—the first stage of their spiritual development. An annual ceremony serves as a rite of passage for these youths, marking the beginning of their journey toward the afterlife.": "阿蒙凯特的公民在很小的时候就开始为五神的考验进行训练。年仅5岁的孩子就被邀请成为圣徒--他们精神发展的第一个阶段。一年一度的仪式是这些年轻人的成人仪式，标志着他们走向来世的旅程的开始。",
	"After completing their training and the construction of the obelisk that will be defended during the Trial of Solidarity, a crop of acolytes is finally prepared to stand before the five gods in the Ceremony of Measurement. Those who are judged worthy are asked to continue their journey toward the afterlife as the God-Pharaoh's initiates. Others are selected by individual gods to take an alternative route to the afterlife, becoming viziers in service to the gods. But some stand in the light of the two suns and are deemed unworthy of either course, lacking in the virtues necessary to secure entry into the afterlife. In particular, acolytes who doubt the God-Pharaoh's teachings or the way of life in Naktamun are culled from the crop and exiled from the city-state.": "在完成他们的训练和建造方尖碑，并在团结审判期间进行防御之后，一批圣徒终于准备好在测量仪式上站在五位神的面前。那些被评定为合格的人被要求作为神-法老的入门者继续他们的来世之旅。其他人则被个别神灵选中，走另一条通往来世的道路，成为为神灵服务的大臣。但有些人站在两个太阳的光芒下，被认为不配走这两条路，他们缺乏进入来世的必要美德。特别是，那些怀疑神-法老的教义或纳克塔蒙的生活方式的信徒被从作物中剔除，并被放逐出城邦。",
	"Your character's background can reflect the results of the Ceremony of Measurement.": "你的角色的背景可以反映测量仪式的结果。",
	"The five gods are the effective rulers of Amonkhet. They are not the creators of the plane, but they are its stewards while the people of Naktamun await the return of the God-Pharaoh. The five gods believe they were created by the God-Pharaoh, who charged them with teaching the people the ways of the God-Pharaoh, and with protecting them until he comes.": "五位神是阿蒙凯特的有效统治者。他们不是飞机的创造者，但他们是飞机的管家，而纳克塔蒙的人民正在等待神-法老的回归。五位神认为他们是由神-法老创造的，神-法老责成他们向人民传授神-法老的方法，并在他到来之前保护他们。",
	"The five gods embody the five virtues the God-Pharaoh wishes to cultivate in those who will become his Eternals in the afterlife. Each god is responsible for modeling and teaching one of those virtues to the acolytes and initiates of Naktamun, and then testing those initiates to ensure that they have mastered their teachings. Thus, they are present during the acolytes' first lessons, during the Ceremony of Measuring, during the initiates' intense training, and at each of the trials that are part of an initiate's journey.": "这五位神体现了神-法老希望在那些将在来世成为他的永恒的人身上培养的五种美德。每位神明都负责向纳克塔门的圣徒和入门者示范和传授其中一种美德，然后测试这些入门者，以确保他们掌握了他们的教义。因此，他们出现在圣徒的第一节课上，出现在测量仪式上，出现在入会者的紧张训练中，也出现在入会者旅程中的每一次考验中。",
	"In the absence of the God-Pharaoh, only the gods can determine whether initiates have proven themselves worthy of the glory of the afterlife. The gods in turn prove their own worthiness by executing their duties infallibly. They make the trials as challenging as possible to ensure that only the most worthy are selected.": "在没有神-法老的情况下，只有诸神才能确定入会者是否证明自己配得上来世的荣耀。反过来，诸神通过无误地执行他们的职责来证明自己的价值。他们使试验尽可能具有挑战性，以确保只有最有价值的人被选中。",
	"Clerics of the five gods, who are typically viziers of the gods, can choose the domains associated with their gods: Solidarity, Knowledge, Strength, Ambition, or Zeal.": "五神的神职人员，通常是诸神的宰相，可以选择与他们的神相关的领域。团结、知识、力量、野心或热情。",
	"The Multiverse is a boundless expanse of worlds. These worlds, called planes, are as different from each other as one living being is from another, varying in size and shape, inhabitants and environments, and even the laws of physics and magic. The existence of magic, though, is a common factor that unites all the known planes.": "多元宇宙是一个无边无际的广袤世界。这些世界被称为 \"平面\"，它们之间的差异就像一个生命体与另一个生命体之间的差异一样，在大小和形状、居民和环境，甚至物理和魔法的规律方面都有不同。不过，魔法的存在是一个共同的因素，它将所有已知的星球结合在一起。",
	"For most inhabitants of a given plane, that plane is the full extent of existence. Esoteric speculation might posit the existence of other worlds, but such concepts are only theoretical. Only a handful of people on any given world know the reality: that all the planes are suspended together in a void called the Aether—or, more poetically, the Blind Eternities. Only one person in a million is born with the potential to travel from one plane to another, and only a fraction of those with the potential actually manage to ignite their sparks and become Planeswalkers.": "对于一个特定平面的大多数居民来说，该平面是存在的全部范围。神秘的猜测可能会假设其他世界的存在，但这种概念只是理论上的。在任何特定的世界上，只有少数人知道现实：所有的平面都悬浮在一个被称为 \"太虚 \"的虚空中，或者更诗意地称为 \"盲目的永恒\"。一百万人中只有一个人天生具有从一个位面到另一个位面的潜力，而那些具有潜力的人中，只有一小部分能够点燃他们的火花，成为行星行者。",
	"Often, this happens as a result of a great crisis or trauma. A near-death experience could ignite the spark, as could a life-changing epiphany or even a revelatory trance. But once their sparks are ignited, all Planeswalkers gain the rare ability to open a pathway through the Blind Eternities and pass from one plane to another.": "通常情况下，这发生在一个巨大的危机或创伤的结果。濒临死亡的经历可以点燃火花，改变生活的顿悟甚至是启示性的恍惚也可以。但是一旦他们的火花被点燃，所有的行者都会获得罕见的能力，打开一条穿越盲目永恒的通道，从一个位面穿越到另一个位面。",
	"The life of a Planeswalker is a life of choice and self-determination, unrestricted by the boundaries of world or fate. Most Planeswalkers dedicate themselves to some personal mission as they explore the secrets of the Multiverse. Often, they discover the depths of their own souls in the process.": "行者的生活是一种选择和自我决定的生活，不受世界或命运的限制。大多数行星行者在探索多元宇宙的秘密时，都会把自己献给一些个人的任务。通常，他们会在这个过程中发现自己灵魂的深处。",
	"This is the fourth Plane Shift article (corresponding to the release of the fourth volume of The Art of Magic: The Gathering), which means that at this point, you could put together a four-person party of Planeswalkers and have each one of them come from a different plane.": "这是第四篇 \"位面转换 \"的文章（对应于《魔法：集会的艺术》第四卷的发行），这意味着在这一点上，你可以组建一个四人的行者队伍，并且让他们每个人都来自不同的位面。",
	"Fundamentally, no game rules are attached to being a Planeswalker. Traveling from plane to plane in this sort of campaign is a lot like overland travel in a normal campaign: it's about getting to where the adventure is. It's a story function, not a rules one. If planeswalking is part of the campaign, then everyone in the party has to be able to do it, so they can travel together. (In modern Magic, there's no way to bring another living person along with you when you planeswalk.) That means there's not really any question of game balance where planeswalking is concerned—it doesn't make one character more powerful than another, and it doesn't make characters any stronger against the enemies they're fighting. So it's something that can be added on to any other character, without changing the character's class, race, or background.": "从根本上说，作为一个行者，没有任何游戏规则可言。在这种战役中，从一个平面到另一个平面的旅行很像普通战役中的陆路旅行：它是为了到达冒险的地方。这是一个故事功能，而不是一个规则功能。如果飞机行走是活动的一部分，那么聚会中的每个人都必须能够做到这一点，所以他们可以一起旅行。(在现代魔法中，当你进行飞机旅行时，没有办法把另一个活人带在身边）。这意味着在飞机旅行方面并不存在任何游戏平衡的问题--它不会使一个角色比另一个角色更强大，也不会使角色对他们正在战斗的敌人更强大。因此，它可以被添加到任何其他角色上，而不改变该角色的等级、种族或背景。",
	"How does planeswalking work? Well, despite the name of this article series, it actually doesn't bear much resemblance to the {@spell plane shift} spell. When characters planeswalk, it usually takes prolonged focus to bring two worlds together and create the bridge to cross between them. This process takes about a minute and is similar to casting a ritual, so it's not generally something that Planeswalkers can do to escape combat. It also doesn't allow for much precision. As a rule, the point on a plane where a Planeswalker arrives is up to the DM, and it's usually the same location for each visit a character makes to a plane.": "飞机行走是如何工作的？好吧，尽管这个系列文章的名字是这样的，但实际上它和{@spell plane shift}法术并没有什么相似之处。当人物进行飞机行走时，通常需要长时间的专注，将两个世界结合在一起，并创造出跨越它们的桥梁。这个过程大约需要一分钟，类似于施放仪式，所以一般来说，这不是行者可以用来逃避战斗的。它也不允许有太多的精确性。作为一项规则，行星行者到达一个平面上的哪一点由DM决定，而且通常一个角色每次访问一个平面都是在同一个位置。",
	"Occasionally in Magic fiction, characters do planeswalk in the middle of combat, usually when something dire is about to happen. (That includes the circumstances when a character's Planeswalker spark first ignites.) To model that, at the DM's discretion, a Planeswalker who is about to drop to 0 hit points can make a Charisma saving throw with a DC equal to the damage taken. On a successful save, the character instead takes no damage and planeswalks away. It's up to the DM what plane the character ends up on, because this isn't usually an intentional process.": "在魔法小说中，偶尔会有角色在战斗中进行飞机行走，通常是在可怕的事情即将发生时。(这包括一个角色的行者火花首次点燃时的情况）。为了模拟这一点，在DM的决定下，一个即将下降到0命中率的行者可以做一个魅力拯救动作，其DC等于所受的伤害。如果救赎成功，这个角色就不会受到任何伤害，并在飞机上行走。这取决于DM，因为这通常不是一个故意的过程。",
	"You could do a lot of adventuring on just the four planes detailed in the art books and Plane Shift articles so far. But if you want to take your Planeswalker characters to Theros, Tarkir, Ravnica, Dominaria, Mirrodin, Alara, Fiora, Lorwyn, Kamigawa, or any other plane in the Magic Multiverse, you can follow the example of what I've been doing in these articles. Reskin and tweak existing monsters, and inject a healthy dose of creativity and improvisation as you go. Some of those worlds are full of creatures that could have stepped right out of the Monster Manual, while others will present a greater challenge.": "到目前为止，你可以仅在艺术书籍和位面转换文章中详述的四个位面进行大量的冒险。但是如果你想把你的行者角色带到塞洛斯、塔克尔、拉夫尼卡、多米尼亚、米尔罗丁、阿拉拉、菲奥拉、洛温、卡米加瓦，或者魔法多元宇宙中的任何其他位面，你可以效仿我在这些文章中的做法。重塑和调整现有的怪物，并在你的过程中注入健康的创造力和即兴发挥。其中一些世界充满了可以直接从《怪物手册》中走出来的生物，而另一些则会带来更大的挑战。",
	"The most important thing is that a campaign involving Planeswalkers requires an agreement between the players and the DM. Even more than usual, if the players decide to ignore the plot hooks set before them and go off anywhere in the Multiverse just because they can, they can make the DM's job more taxing than fun. It's one thing to have a Planeswalker pop off to Ravnica for an hour to buy a cup of coffee, but it's quite another for the players to decide that they want to take on the corruption of New Phyrexia today, instead of following clues that lead clearly to an Innistrad campaign.": "最重要的是，涉及行者的活动需要玩家和DM之间达成协议。甚至比平时更甚，如果玩家决定无视摆在他们面前的情节钩子，只是因为他们可以去多元宇宙的任何地方，他们就会使DM的工作变得更加费力而不是有趣。让一个行者到拉夫尼卡去买杯咖啡一小时是一回事，但玩家决定今天要去对付新菲莱克斯的腐败，而不是根据线索明确地去参加因斯特拉的活动，那就完全是另一回事。",
	"Speaking of New Phyrexia, a campaign with Planeswalkers is generally more fun with higher-level characters. The Planeswalkers who feature in the stories of Magic are powerful mages of various kinds, and their actions can sometimes decide the fate of whole planes. It doesn't always need to be like that, of course, but it can be hard to motivate characters with the ability to travel literally anywhere to stick around and root out a nest of giant rats.": "说到新菲莱克斯，有行者的战役一般都是由高等级的角色来进行的，会更有趣。魔法故事中的行者是各种强大的法师，他们的行动有时会决定整个星球的命运。当然，这并不总是需要的，但是要激励那些有能力去任何地方旅行的角色坚持下去并铲除一窝大老鼠是很难的。",
	"So can Planeswalker characters travel from Amonkhet to whatever plane the Forgotten Realms lies on? That's up to you. The Plane Shift series more or less assumes a certain continuity from one Multiverse to the next, even as (for example) it makes no attempt to model Magic's five colors of mana in the D&D magic system. So there's no real reason an elf from Evereska couldn't \"spark out\" and find herself on Kaladesh, as long as it works for your players and your campaign.": "那么，行者角色可以从阿蒙凯特（Amonkhet）旅行到被遗忘的领域所在的任何平面吗？这由你决定。Plane Shift系列或多或少地假定了一个多元宇宙与另一个多元宇宙之间的某种连续性，甚至（例如）它没有试图在D&D魔法系统中模拟魔法的五种颜色的法力。因此，只要对你的玩家和你的活动有效，没有真正的理由让一个来自埃弗里斯卡的精灵不能 \"闪现 \"并在卡拉德什找到自己。",
	"Five deadly trials await the people of this plane as they hope for a glorious death—and eternal glory in the afterlife. But their true fate lies in the hands of the sinister Nicol Bolas.": "五个致命的考验在等待着这个星球上的人们，他们希望获得光荣的死亡--在来世获得永恒的荣耀。但他们的真正命运却掌握在阴险的尼科尔-博拉斯手中。",
	"Home to the volcanic continent of Shiv, the time-shattered isle of Tolaria, and the cold mountains of Keld, Dominaria is the setting for brutal conflicts and home to powerful mages.": "多米尼亚是希夫火山大陆、托拉利亚时空岛和凯尔德寒冷山脉的所在地，是残酷冲突的背景，也是强大法师的家。",
