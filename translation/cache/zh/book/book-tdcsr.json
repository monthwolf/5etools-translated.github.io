	"Inspiration can come from anywhere: a musician's song, the advice of a close friend, or just the trust that another being places in you. In my experience, few things can compare to the surge of joy and motivation that being inspired gives.": "灵感可能来自任何地方：音乐家的歌曲，亲密朋友的建议，或者只是另一个生物对你的信任。根据我的经验，很少有事情能比得上被启发时带来的喜悦和动力。",
	"I have often found inspiration in fantasy worlds and books of adventure, mystery, and magic. I grew up devouring every novel I was handed, seeking to lose myself in the words of another mind, channeling the images they evoked in my mind into my sketchbook. But it wasn't until I discovered tabletop roleplaying games that I felt truly empowered to create my own worlds, places like the ones that I so often found myself lost in. Even better, it let me share all the ideas in my head with my friends, and they could do the same with me. I was spellbound.": "我经常在奇幻世界和冒险、神秘、魔法书籍中找到灵感。我从小就痴迷于阅读每一本小说，试图沉浸在另一个思想的文字中，将它们在我的脑海中唤起的画面转化到我的素描本上。但直到我发现桌面角色扮演游戏，我才真正感到有能力创造自己的世界，像那些我经常迷失其中的地方一样。更棒的是，它让我与朋友分享我脑海中的所有想法，他们也可以和我一样。我被这一切深深吸引。",
	"It's been about twenty-five years since my first game. Since then, I've drawn endless inspiration from the imaginations of my friends and loved ones as we tell heroic stories around a table with dice and paper. I've found a circle of friends who share my love of dramatic storytelling, my belief that failure in games is just as exciting as success (maybe even more so), and my delight in being inspired by moments of improvisational brilliance. It's still surreal that we found a way to share that with the world; {@i Critical Role} has become a phenomenon that's surpassed my wildest dreams. Over the past few years, we've built the magical world of Exandria together, warts and all, and somehow it's become a world that millions of others have engaged with and invested their imaginations in. I hope it's inspired you to create your own adventures, stories, and joyful memories. Through Vox Machina's epic tale, the land of Tal'Dorei became a landscape rife with intrigue, conflict, and endless possibility... and we wanted to share it with you.": "距离我第一次游戏已经大约二十五年了。从那时起，我从朋友和亲人的想象中汲取了无尽的灵感，我们围坐在桌旁，用骰子和纸张讲述英雄故事。我找到了一群和我一样热爱戏剧性叙事、相信游戏中的失败和成功同样令人兴奋（甚至更甚），并且乐于从即兴表现中获得灵感的朋友。我们竟然找到了一种方式与世界分享这一切，{@i Critical Role} 已经成为了超乎我最狂野梦想的现象。在过去的几年里，我们共同打造了魔幻世界 Exandria，无论是好是坏，不知何故它已经成为了数百万人投入想象力的世界。我希望它激励了你创造属于自己的冒险、故事和快乐记忆。通过 Vox Machina 的史诗故事，Tal'Dorei 大地变成了一个充满阴谋、冲突和无尽可能性的景观……我们希望与你分享。",
	"Years ago, I had an opportunity to bring Tal'Dorei to the page and invite the world to tell their own stories in Exandria. The thrill of the opportunity was incredible, but the immense pressure and fear of failure (given my absolute lack of experience doing something like this) made it a strenuous journey on an incredibly short timeline. I was incredibly blessed to have become friends with the immeasurably brilliant James Haeck around that time, and I asked him to join me in this task. My good fortune found him agreeing, and with his help and inspiration, it somehow came together. With that, a limited run of the {@i Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting} went into the world.": "多年前，我有机会将塔尔多雷(Tal'Dorei)带到纸面上，并邀请世界在艾克桑德里亚(Exandria)中讲述他们自己的故事。这个机会的刺激是难以置信的，但由于我完全没有做过这样的事情的经验，巨大的压力和失败的恐惧使这成为了一段非常艰难的旅程，而且时间非常紧迫。那时我非常幸运能够结识了无比聪明的詹姆斯·海克(James Haeck)，我请他加入这个任务。我的好运让他同意了，有了他的帮助和启发，一切不可思议地凑在了一起。于是，一次限量发行的{@i Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting}进入了世界。",
	"Time has passed, both in our world and within the world of Exandria. Vox Machina's greatest adventures came to a close. Looking two decades later (within Exandria), we embarked on a new adventure with the Mighty Nein in the land of Wildemount...but Vox Machina and Tal'Dorei remained deeply dear to my heart. The question arose: what would Tal'Dorei look like these two decades later? What changes would have taken place in the recovery following the Chroma Conclave and the ascension of the Whispered One? How would the legendary heroes of Vox Machina have adjusted to life after the end of their story? What dangers and threats, both old and new, would the next generation of heroes need to rise up against?": "时间已经过去，无论是在我们的世界还是在Exandria的世界中。Vox Machina最伟大的冒险已经落幕。回顾两个十年后（在Exandria内部），我们在Wildemount大陆上与Mighty Nein展开了一场新的冒险...但Vox Machina和Tal'Dorei仍然深深地印在我的心中。一个问题浮现：这两个十年后的Tal'Dorei会是什么样子？在克罗玛龙族的袭击和Whispered One的崛起后，会发生什么变化？Vox Machina的传奇英雄们在他们故事结束后会如何调整生活？下一代英雄们将面临哪些新旧危险和威胁，需要奋起抵抗？",
	"Inspiration struck once more, and now that {@i Critical Role} had the means to do so...we needed to answer these questions for both ourselves and the numerous Critters who often conjectured as we did. \"{@book Who is on the Tal'Dorei Council?|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council}\" Well, we can finally answer that! I immediately called James Haeck back to the fray, and we were joined this time by the extraordinary mind and talents of Hannah Rose to elevate these ideas into something better than I could have hoped. Between us, Tal'Dorei was Reborn. We invite you to get lost in this world, learn of its intricacies and secrets, and, I hope, be inspired to make this world yours as well.": "灵感再次降临，现在{@i Critical Role}有了这样的能力……我们需要为自己和那些常常像我们一样推测的众多Critters回答这些问题。\"{@book Who is on the Tal'Dorei Council?|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council}\" 好了，我们终于可以回答了！我立刻召回了詹姆斯·海克，这一次我们还有汉娜·罗斯这位非凡的头脑和才华加入，将这些想法提升到我之前所期望不到的更高水平。在我们之间，塔尔多雷得以重生。我们邀请你迷失在这个世界中，了解它的复杂和秘密，希望你也能被激发，让这个世界成为你的世界。",

It is said those who fall afoul of Ruidus failed to give it the deference it is due—and so superstitious folk rarely dare to make plans while the full light of Ruidus shines above, let alone enact them.": "另一方面，瑞德斯（Ruidus）被令人不安的谣言和民间传说所包围，以至于有人相信另一个未知的神灵或力量统治着这颗小小的红褐色卫星。世界各地的文化都讲述着无数传说，讲述了那些在月圆之时——当它闪耀出明亮的朱红色而非通常的赤红色时——在月光下制定宏伟计划或尝试行动的骄傲统治者，他们被迫目睹自己的努力遭遇了无法预料的不幸。据说那些得罪了瑞德斯的人未能给予它应有的尊重，因此迷信的人们很少敢在瑞德斯的满月之光照耀下制定计划，更不用说实施它们了。",
	"Worse yet, some tales forebode dark fortunes for those born under the light of a full Ruidus, a curse of ill luck that will follow them throughout their lives. Though the cruel practice of moon-sacrifice is no longer permitted in any of Tal'Dorei's cities, some far-flung settlements still secretly sacrifice children born under a full Ruidus to \"save\" them from a cursed life, and to appease the dark and unknowable appetites of the red moon.": "更糟糕的是，一些传说预示着在满月Ruidus下出生的人将遭受黑暗的厄运，这是一种不幸的诅咒，将伴随他们一生。尽管在塔尔多瑞（Tal'Dorei）的任何城市中都不再允许残酷的月神祭祀，但一些偏远的定居点仍在秘密地牺牲在满月Ruidus下出生的儿童，以“拯救”他们免受诅咒的生活，并安抚红月的黑暗和无法预测的欲望。",
	"Fortunately for the superstitious, Ruidus is rarely full. While its cousin, Catha, completes a full cycle approximately once a month, Ruidus's haunting, half-year orbit, combined with its eerie and unexplainable tendency to simply not appear in the sky on certain nights or glow with unknown light, creating an unexpected full moon, has only added to its mythic reputation as an omen of ill fortune.": "幸运的是，对于迷信者来说，(Ruidus)很少是满月。虽然它的表兄弟(Catha)大约每个月完成一次完整的循环，但(Ruidus)那令人毛骨悚然的半年轨道，再加上它神秘而无法解释的倾向，有时在某些夜晚不会出现在天空中，或发出未知的光芒，造成意外的满月，这些都增添了它作为不祥之兆的神话声誉。",
	"O Ruidus, grant humble chorus leave": "噢，瑞德斯(O Ruidus)，赐予谦卑合唱团离开的许可。",

	"The planes surrounding Exandria are similar to the planes presented in fifth edition lore. Below are brief descriptions of some of the planes that a party of powerful adventurers may travel to. These planes go by many poetic and fanciful names.": "围绕着艾克桑德里亚的位面与第五版设定中的位面相似。以下是一些强大冒险者队伍可能前往的位面的简要描述。这些位面有许多诗意和幻想的名字。",
	"The Material Plane is a land where natural laws work as we expect. It is a place of all four elements, and of plants, animals, and minerals.

	"When the Protean Gods discovered Exandria, it was like a barren ship adrift in a sea of churning, chaotic elements. As a part of their creation, the elements were thrust away from the world. Some theorize that the Elemental Planes were created from this banished chaos, while others believe the elemental chaos seeped into the Material Plane from tears in the fabric of the planes.": "当变形神发现艾克桑德里亚((Exandria))时，它就像是一艘漂泊在搅动混沌元素之海中的贫瘠之船。作为他们创造的一部分，元素被推离了这个世界。有人推测元素位面是从这被放逐的混沌中创造出来的，而另一些人则认为元素混沌从位面之间的裂缝渗入了物质位面。",
	"The latter may be more likely, as rifts between the Elemental Planes can be found across Exandria. The largest of these rifts are tended to by the four Ashari civilizations, and any who gaze within find wild wastelands of pure elemental power: roiling seas of fire, towering mountains of gnashing stone, infinite skies filled with cloud-top settlements, and endless, stormy oceans of water.": "后者可能更有可能发生，因为元素位面之间的裂缝可以在艾克桑德里亚（Exandria）各地找到。 这些裂缝中最大的由四个阿沙瑞（Ashari）文明来管理，任何凝视其中的人都会发现纯粹元素力量的荒凉荒野：翻滚的火海、咬牙切齿的巨大石山、充满云端定居点的无尽天空，以及无尽、多风暴的水海。",
	"Parallel to Exandria are odd reflections of its reality. The Fey Realm is a plane of natural beauty and ferocity, inhabited by fey folk. The Plane of Shadow is a dour, sinister mirror of the world that is. And the Ethereal Plane is a hazy film across the material world, as if it were viewed through an old, cloudy mirror, inhabited not only by restless spirits, but also by predators that target those who cling to the world of the living.": "在艾克桑德里亚（Exandria）平行的是其现实的奇特倒影。仙境（Fey Realm）是一个自然美丽而凶猛的位面，居住着仙族。暗影位面（Plane of Shadow）是世界的一面阴郁、邪恶的镜子。以太位面（Ethereal Plane）则是一层朦胧的薄膜，横跨在物质世界之上，仿佛透过一面古老、模糊的镜子看世界，这里不仅居住着不安的幽灵，还有那些猎食那些执着于活着世界的生灵的掠食者。",
	"All the prior planes exist directly adjacent to the Material Plane, buttressing and occasionally co-mingling with its inhabitants. All the planes that follow are separated from the material world by a vast sea of starlight, barren asteroids, and misty nebulae of unpredictable magic. In the ancient past, arcanists had to craft vessels to sail the treacherous sea of stars to travel between their home plane and the mysterious Outer Planes.": "所有之前的位面都直接毗邻物质位面，支撑并偶尔与其居民混合在一起。接下来的所有位面都被一片星光、贫瘠的小行星和充满不可预测魔法的雾状星云所分隔，与物质世界隔绝。在古老的过去，奥术师们不得不制造船只穿越危险的星海，在家乡位面和神秘的外部位面之间旅行。",

	"All of these planes are strongly aligned to one or more cosmic principles of good, evil, law, and chaos, based on the divine powers that reside there. Because of the Divine Gate established after the {@book Divergence|TDCSR|1|The Divergence}, no divine powers can depart these planes, for the sake of all Creation. The gods' supernatural creations can pass through the Divine Gate, though the more powerful they grow—and thus, the closer they come to divinity—the harder it is for them to pass through. However, mortals and lesser supernatural beings who possess magic to travel between the planes can travel to and from Outer Planes like the Hells, the Abyss, Elysium, and Pandemonium unhindered by the Divine Gate.": "所有这些位面都与一个或多个宇宙原则——善、恶、秩序和混沌——强烈契合，这取决于驻留在那里的神圣力量。由于在{@book Divergence|TDCSR|1|The Divergence}之后建立了神圣之门，为了整个创世，没有神圣力量可以离开这些位面。尽管神灵们的超自然创造物可以穿过神圣之门，但随着它们变得更加强大——因此，接近神性——它们通过的难度也越大。然而，拥有魔法穿梭于位面之间的凡人和次级超自然生物可以自由地往来于地狱、深渊、极乐之地和混沌地等外部位面，不受神圣之门的阻碍。",
	"Far beyond even the divine Outer Planes is a realm where all laws of nature break down completely. Mortal senses have no way of properly perceiving the nature of these far-distant realms, and most minds that try to comprehend them snap under the strain of so much unfamiliar stimulus. These maddening realities and the alien horrors that live within them are mercifully kept away from the known multiverse by the unimaginable distance of space.": "远超神圣外域，有一个领域，那里自然法则完全崩溃。凡人的感官无法正确感知这些遥远领域的本质，大多数试图理解它们的思维在如此多的陌生刺激下崩溃。这些令人发狂的现实和其中生活的外星恐怖生物被太空无法想象的距离幸运地远离已知多元宇宙。",
	"Some creatures of the beyond have lurked on the Material Plane since ancient times, perhaps at the invitation of the {@deity The Chained Oblivion|Exandria|TDCSR|Chained Oblivion} itself, or because the divine powers unleashed in the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity} punched holes in time and space that allowed such aberrations to slither into Exandria unimpeded.": "一些来自异界的生物自古以来就潜伏在物质位面上，也许是受到了{@deity The Chained Oblivion|Exandria|TDCSR|Chained Oblivion}的邀请，或者是因为在{@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}中释放的神圣力量打开了时空裂缝，使得这些畸变生物得以毫无阻碍地滑入埃克桑德里亚。",

	"Where did Tal'Dorei come from? The origin of this land is a time-shrouded question that everyone has pondered in some way, from the most exalted, world-traveling hero to the common farmer who has never traveled three miles beyond their village. Everyone has their own ideas on where Tal'Dorei, and all of the wide world of Exandria, came from. These varied thoughts all have some things in common, since they are all born of jumbled misunderstandings of ancient myths told orally from bard to bard, then passed from father to daughter, and eventually codified into religious re-writings of history that favor the teachings of a given deity.": "Tal'Dorei（塔尔多雷）的起源是一个笼罩在时间中的问题，每个人都以某种方式思考过，无论是最崇高的世界旅行英雄还是从未离开过村庄三英里的普通农夫。每个人对塔尔多雷和整个埃克桑德利亚世界的起源都有自己的想法。这些不同的想法都有一些共同之处，因为它们都源于古代神话的混乱误解，口口相传，从吟游诗人传给吟游诗人，然后传给父亲的女儿，最终被编纂成偏向某个神明教义的宗教史的历史。",

These two organizations have assembled this history by digging beneath the layers of dust and decay that hide battles long past, unearthing texts long thought burned and censored, and exhuming historical treasures from tombs of heroes long forgotten. The details are often debated, for the question of the land's origin remains—consuming the curious, calling those hungry for purpose, and fueling the business of adventuring to delve into the tantalizing unknown places of the world.": "要讲述关于塔尔多瑞的完整和准确的真相是一项不可能的任务，然而，塔尔多瑞以创造那些经常做出不可能之事的人而闻名。接下来是《艾克桑德里亚神话》，这是根据塔尔多瑞最杰出的学者——本土组织{@book Alabaster Lyceum|TDCSR|3|5. Alabaster Lyceum}和国际知识追求者以及反宣传主义者{@book Cobalt Soul|TDCSR|2|Library of the Cobalt Soul}的调查和最大努力编写的记载。这两个组织通过挖掘隐藏着久远战役的尘埃和腐朽、发掘长期被认为已经被焚烧和审查的文本、以及从被遗忘已久的英雄之墓中挖掘历史宝藏，编纂了这段历史。这些细节经常被争论，因为这片土地的起源问题仍然存在——这吸引了那些好奇的人，呼唤着那些渴望目的的人，并推动着冒险事业，去探索世界中那些诱人的未知之地。",
	"Before the history of the lands of Tal'Dorei can be explored, its context in the history of Exandria itself must be thoroughly established. The world of Exandria is home to four major continents, dozens of nations, and untold tiny pockets of civilization amid a wondrous, dangerous wilderness. Every civilization, from the largest empire to the tiniest nomadic clan, has its own interpretation of where its story began. Even within the world of Exandria, different cultures have creation myths that eventually converge with history, but there is no known definitive story.": "在探索塔尔多雷大陆的历史之前，必须充分了解其在艾克桑德里亚历史中的背景。 艾克桑德里亚世界拥有四个主要大陆，数十个国家，以及在神奇而危险的荒野中无数微小的文明聚落。 每个文明，无论是最大的帝国还是最小的游牧部落，都有自己关于故事起源的解释。 即使在艾克桑德里亚世界中，不同的文化也有创世神话，最终与历史融合，但没有已知的明确故事。",

Alabaster Lyceum} can say, with only the most trivial of doubts, that the city of Vasselheim in {@book Othanzia|TDCSR|3|Issylra} truly deserves its title of the \"Dawn City.\" It is here, to our researchers' best understanding, where the stories of all mortal peoples begin. Vasselheim became Exandria's oldest surviving city by virtue of not just being built long ago, but by enduring the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity} (which shall be elucidated presently), a miraculous feat that few other charted settlements can claim to have accomplished.": "即便如此，生命始终追求理解其起源。在这份报告中，{@book Cobalt Soul|TDCSR|2|Library of the Cobalt Soul}和{@book Emon's|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship} {@book Alabaster Lyceum|TDCSR|3|5. Alabaster Lyceum} 的集思广益可以肯定地说，瓦瑟海姆城在{@book Othanzia|TDCSR|3|Issylra} 确实当之无愧地享有“黎明之城”的称号。据我们研究人员最好的理解，这里是所有凡人故事的开端。瓦瑟海姆城之所以成为艾克桑德里亚最古老的幸存城市，不仅仅是因为它建立在很久以前，更是因为经历了{@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}（即将阐明），这是少数其他已知定居点所能宣称完成的奇迹。",
	"In short, Vasselheim houses the earliest known temples to the gods, and the earliest known records of history that survived this catastrophe. It is these sources that this joint research initiative treats as its primary documents, though great effort has been made to corroborate their claims through later sources. It is in the chronicles of Vasselheim that the earliest account of the myth of the {@book Founding|TDCSR|1|The Founding} is recorded—and indeed, this history is the most commonly accepted origin of the world in the Republic of Tal'Dorei. Though countless regional variations muddy the historical record, the broad strokes of this mythic history are undeniable.": "简而言之，瓦瑟海姆（Vasselheim）拥有已知最早的神庙，以及幸存于这场灾难中的最早的历史记录。正是这些来源被这项联合研究计划视为其主要文件，尽管已经付出了巨大努力通过后来的来源来证实它们的主张。正是在瓦瑟海姆的编年史中，{@book Founding|TDCSR|1|The Founding}神话的最早记载被记录下来—事实上，这段历史是塔尔多雷共和国（Tal'Dorei）世界最常被接受的起源。尽管无数地区变体使历史记录变得模糊不清，但这个神话历史的大致轮廓是不可否认的。",
	"Long ago, this world was one of tumultuous and chaotic forces, naught but unbridled fire, seething oceans, and churning, gnashing rock. Through the ashen skies of Primordial Creation, the gods arrived from an unknown realm located beyond the ether. These ambitious divinities—young and still formless—looked down upon this roiling realm and saw potential for great strength and outstanding beauty, and the chance to learn their own place in creation.": "很久以前，这个世界是一个充满动荡和混沌力量的地方，只有无法控制的火焰、翻腾的海洋和咆哮的岩石。在原始创世的灰烬天空中，众神从一个位于以太之外的未知领域到来。这些雄心勃勃的神灵——年轻而形态尚未定型——俯视着这个翻腾的领域，看到了巨大力量和卓越美丽的潜力，以及学习他们在创世中的位置的机会。",
	"From the divine hands of the {@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart} sprung forth the First Children, the {@book elves|TDCSR|4|elves}. It is thought that they were made in their creator's image, yet it is just as likely that the {@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart}, and all the gods who shared their ideas with them, actually adopted forms inspired by the image of their creations. The First Children walked the lush Green and gazed upon the heavenly Blue as the gods tamed Primordial Creation around them.": "从{@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart}的神圣之手中诞生了第一代子民，{@book elves|TDCSR|4|elves}。人们认为他们是按照他们的创造者的形象制造的，然而同样有可能是{@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart}，以及所有与他们分享思想的众神，实际上是受到他们所创造的形象的启发而采取了形态。第一代子民走在郁郁葱葱的绿色中，凝视着天空的蔚蓝，而众神在他们周围驯服着原始创造物。",
	"Not long after, in the scale of the cosmos, a second mortal creation was wrought by the divine {@deity The All-Hammer|Exandria|TDCSR|All-Hammer}: the {@book dwarves|TDCSR|4|dwarves}, a hearty people imbued with the desire to continue the gods' work—taming a primordial world filled with the craft and invention of the divinity that lay beyond the ashen void. In their turn, a third people were given life by the passionate lovers of Order and Chaos, the {@deity The Lawbearer|Exandria|TDCSR|Lawbearer} and the {@deity The Wildmother|Exandria|TDCSR|Wildmother}. Their children were the {@book humans|TDCSR|4|humans}, endowed with hearts of passion to bring meaning to the world as it assumed an orderly form.

	"As a note from the High Curator of {@book Emon's|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship} Cobalt Reserve, the chronicle of Vasselheim states that the gods were given form and name only when the peoples of Exandria began to worship them—yet many of the various races of the world ascribe their creation to a single god or group of gods. It would be remiss to not at least conjecture that while the Protean Gods lacked distinct form, they still had unique thoughts, emotions, and motivations that were later codified through the worship of the people.": "作为{@book Emon's|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}钴蓝储备的高级馆长的一则说明，瓦瑟海姆编年史记载，只有当艾克桑德里亚的人民开始崇拜他们时，众神才被赋予形态和名字——然而世界上许多不同种族都将他们的创造归因于一个单一的神或一组神。我们不应忽视这样的猜测：虽然多变神们缺乏明确的形态，但他们仍然拥有独特的思想、情感和动机，这些后来通过人们的崇拜被编纂成了神话。",
	"As inspiration flowed from the Protean Gods, other creations followed, giving life to Exandria's many peoples. Here the mythic record of Vasselheim grows unclear, for while the {@book elves|TDCSR|4|elves}, {@book dwarves|TDCSR|4|dwarves}, and {@book humans|TDCSR|4|humans} were undeniably Exandria's first races, the identities of the many Children of Creation that followed were left unrecorded by the Dawn City's chroniclers.": "当灵感从多变的神灵中涌现时，其他创造物相继而来，赋予了艾克桑德里亚众多民族生命。在这里，瓦瑟海姆的神话记录变得模糊不清，因为虽然{@book elves|TDCSR|4|elves}、{@book dwarves|TDCSR|4|dwarves}和{@book humans|TDCSR|4|humans}无疑是艾克桑德里亚的第一族群，但随后出现的许多创世之子的身份却未被黎明之城的编年史学家记录。",
	"These myriad young races explored their freshly founded world. As their knowledge grew, they attempted to build. But the land was fierce and treacherous, and the lives of the children were extinguished mercilessly by the still-chaotic world. Sorrow is said to have filled the hearts of the gods as they watched their children struggle against a land that rebuked them. The gods ultimately lent their children tiny fragments of their own power, gifts with which they might shape the world around them.": "这些无数的年轻种族探索着他们新建立的世界。随着他们的知识增长，他们尝试着建设。但大地是凶猛而狡诈的，孩子们的生命被这个仍然混乱的世界无情地扼杀。据说悲伤充满了众神的心灵，因为他们看着自己的孩子们努力对抗一个拒绝他们的土地。最终，众神借给他们的孩子们自己微小力量的碎片，这些礼物让他们能够塑造周围的世界。",
	"This small mercy of the gods was the birth of magic, and with it the people of Exandria learned to bend the angry earth to their will, to temper the wrath of its explosive mountains, to tame its unyielding floods, and to make the hard earth soft and bountiful. Wandering peoples settled, language became commonplace, survival gave way to art, and governance replaced anarchy. The Protean Creators, the divinity beyond the ashen skies, saw progress and saw that it was good—but fragile, and in need of guardians.": "这是众神的一点小恩惠，诞生了魔法，随之而来的是艾克桑德里亚的居民学会驾驭愤怒的大地，调和其喷发的火山之怒，驯服其顽强的洪水，并使坚硬的土地变得柔软且丰盛。游牧民族定居，语言变得普遍，生存让位于艺术，治理取代了无政府状态。多变的造物主，那灰烬天空之上的神性，看到了进步，看到了它的美好—但脆弱，需要守护者。",
	"Thus were born the First Protectors: the Dragons Metallic of Tal'Dorei. These Protectors pledged themselves to defend the weak against tyrants. It is here that the mythic tales connect to the oldest, most fragmented passages of recorded history as civilization's reach stretched across the world. The people praised the gods for their newfound safety, and their prayers gave them forms, names, and purpose.": "因此，第一批守护者诞生了：塔尔多瑞的金属龙((Tal'Dorei))。这些守护者誓言保卫弱者免受暴君的侵害。就在这里，神话故事与最古老、最分散的历史记录相连，随着文明的延伸遍布全球。人们为他们新获得的安全感谢神灵，他们的祈祷赋予了神明形态、名字和目的。",
	"Yet the realm refused to be tamed. Quaking cliffs roared in defiance of mortalkind's magical gifts. Seas swelled and seethed. Flames erupted from below with greater intensity than any had seen before. Beneath the elements, unknown to the Creators beyond the ashen skies, lived ancient beings who were born in the primeval chaos of the world the gods had found: the Primordials. These elemental titans that once dwelt deep within the land now rose from their unseen domain to sunder it once more. The gods watched as their children were crushed between gnashing rocks and fed to formless terrors unleashed in the wake of the destruction. Thus were the seeds of Exandria's greatest cataclysm set into motion.": "然而，这片领域拒绝被驯服。颤动的悬崖对凡人的魔法礼物表示抗拒。海洋汹涌澎湃。火焰从地底喷发，比任何人以前见过的更加猛烈。在元素之下，超越灰烬天空的造物者所知的，生活着在世界的原始混沌中诞生的古老存在：原初者。这些曾深居土地深处的元素巨人现在从看不见的领域中升起，再次将其分裂。众神看着他们的孩子被咬碎在摩擦的岩石之间，并被喂给在毁灭之后释放的无形恐怖。这就是埃克桑德里亚最大灾变的种子被激发的方式。",
	"Some gods were so full of grief and anger that they wished to abandon this world for another. They tried to convince their divine kindred to join the Primordials in reclaiming the realm for chaos, so that they could move on to start anew. Others wished to prove they could tame the world for their beloved children. This caused a divide among the gods. The schismatic deities, known today as the {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|2|Betrayer Gods}, joined their songs and swords to those of chaos and destruction, taking and twisting their children into the image of their intent.": "一些神灵充满悲伤和愤怒，他们希望放弃这个世界，前往另一个世界。他们试图说服他们的神族加入原初者，重新夺回混沌的领域，以便他们可以开始新的生活。其他神灵希望证明他们可以驯服这个世界，为他们心爱的子民。这导致了神灵之间的分歧。今天被称为{@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|2|Betrayer Gods}的分裂神明，加入了混沌和毁灭的歌声和剑，将他们的子民带入他们意图的形象中。",
	"The cosmos itself seemed to recognize the magnitude of the battle on Exandria, and beings of Order and Chaos spilled forth from the still-young multiverse. Creatures of chaos emerged from a formless void that Exandria's peoples came to call the Abyss.": "宇宙本身似乎意识到在埃克桑德里亚的战斗的重要性，秩序与混沌的存在从尚年轻的多元宇宙中涌现。混沌之物从一个无形虚空中出现，埃克桑德里亚的人们称之为深渊。",
	"These demons fed upon the suffering of the wounded and the dying, and grew cruel. Sentinels of order emerged from a distant realm of celestial harmony. The {@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|2|Prime Deities} beseeched these celestials to aid them. In turn, the {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|2|Betrayer Gods} forced order upon the demons and made them devils, perfectly lawful soldiers who lived only to cause harm.": "这些恶魔以伤者和垂死者的痛苦为食，变得残忍。来自遥远的天界和谐领域的秩序哨兵出现了。{@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|2|Prime Deities}恳求这些天界生灵帮助他们。反过来，{@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|2|Betrayer Gods}强加秩序于恶魔，使它们成为恶魔，完全遵循法则的士兵，只为造成伤害而活。",
	"As the clash of gods and Primordials spiraled out of control, the desperate mortal races sought their own way to defend themselves from the rebellious elements. Seeing that their creations still suffered, the {@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart} taught them the secrets of making magic themselves. The most intelligent and inquisitive mortal minds followed the path the gods had revealed to them, and created incantations and formulae to create new spells on their own terms, without the aid of divine power. These people called themselves arcanists, for they were masters of the arcane secrets of magic.": "随着诸神和原初之神的冲突失控，绝望的凡间种族寻找自己的方法来抵御叛逆元素。看到他们的创造物仍然受苦，{@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart}教导他们制造魔法的秘密。最聪明、最好奇的凡间思想追随神明向他们展示的道路，创造了咒语和配方，以自己的方式创造新的法术，不依赖神力。这些人自称为奥术师，因为他们是魔法奥秘的大师。",
	"With their potent new magics, these resourceful mortals subdued the Primordials long enough for the {@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|2|Prime Deities} to banish their traitorous kin to secluded prison planes. With the {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|2|Betrayer Gods} locked away, the gods were overjoyed to see the resourcefulness of their children. The defeated Primordials were destroyed, and from their ever-enduring essences, the gods channeled their wild and destructive powers into the Elemental Planes that surround the material world of Exandria.": "凭借他们强大的新魔法，这些足智多谋的凡人成功地制服了原始者们，足以让{@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|2|Prime Deities}将他们背叛的同类放逐到了隐秘的监禁位面。随着{@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|2|Betrayer Gods}被锁定，众神为看到他们子民的足智多谋而欢欣鼓舞。被打败的原始者们被摧毁，而众神从他们永恒的本质中汲取了他们狂野而具有毁灭性的力量，注入到环绕着Exandria物质世界的元素位面中。",

From this peace was born the first enduring mortal civilization, the heart of which was a grand city called Vasselheim, the Cradle of Creation and the Dawn City.": "自创世以来，艾克桑德利亚（Exandria）终于安定下来，进入了一段宁静祥和的时期。在这段和平中诞生了第一个持久的人类文明，其核心是一个名为瓦瑟海姆（Vasselheim）的宏伟城市，也被称为创世之床和黎明之城。",
	"Culture developed anew, the races ventured beyond to explore and discover their own lands, and great music filled the air to give name to this world once and for all: Exandria.": "文化得以重新发展，各个种族开始冒险探索和发现自己的土地，美妙的音乐充斥着空气，为这个世界正式命名：艾克桑德利亚(Exandria)。",
	"The foremost scholars of our day would make it seem an indisputable fact that the gods created Exandria. That they blessed us with the bounty that all peoples of the world now make use of. So too, they say, was magic their gift to us. But such zealots ignore the fact that there is another likelihood: that the gods did not create mortals, and their world—but the opposite. That the dreams of mortals mingled in the wild magic of the young world, and gave that magic form and order: divinity. Of course, the dogmatic zealots of our day will dismiss such ideas as heresy—but not you, reader! The avid mind feeds not on dogma, but on new ideas!": "当今最杰出的学者们似乎将神创造了艾克桑德里亚这一事实视为不容置疑。他们认为神赐予我们丰富的恩惠，现在世界上所有民族都在利用。同样，他们说，魔法也是他们赐予我们的礼物。但这些狂热者忽略了另一种可能性：神并没有创造凡人和他们的世界，而是相反。凡人的梦想与年轻世界的狂野魔法交融，赋予那种魔法形式和秩序：神性。当然，当今的教条狂热者会将这样的想法视为异端，但你，读者，不会！渴望知识的头脑不是靠教条，而是靠新思想！",
	"Ages passed, and society flourished. Great kingdoms sprung up. Castles were built in a day, accelerated by the arcanists' newfound power.

	"Yet, with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the very magic which allowed mortalkind to prosper also instilled a deep rot within their civilizations. The arcanists of the world grew arrogant. They came to see their arcane gifts as proof that the gods held no sway over their fate, and that with a sophisticated enough command of magic, they could become as powerful as the gods themselves. Though this hurt and surprised the {@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|2|Prime Deities} who had imprisoned their kin for the sake of their children, they sought to sympathize with the willfulness of their creations, remaining out of love and hoping that the mortals would learn the error of their ways.": "然而，事后看来，很明显，让凡人繁荣的魔法也在他们的文明中埋下了深深的腐烂。世界上的奥术师变得傲慢自大。他们开始将自己的奥术天赋视为证明神灵对他们命运没有影响力的证据，并认为只要掌握足够复杂的魔法，他们就能变得和神灵一样强大。尽管这伤害了并让{@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|2|Prime Deities}感到惊讶，他们曾为了子孙将自己的同类囚禁，但他们试图体谅自己创造物的固执，出于爱仍保持距离，希望凡人能认识到自己错误的道路。",
	"The advent of the arcane seemed to be the key to a bountiful age of plenty, but also proved to threaten it, as prosperity soon gave way to greed. Rather than universal goodwill and comfort for all, the {@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|1|Age of Arcanum} came to be defined by endless petty squabbles over wealth and power among the elite, while those without magic hunted for their scraps. Tantalizing rumors of a path to immortality slithered through the most decadent circles of magi and nobility. One mortal mage, her name lost and presumed to be struck from history, crafted now-forbidden rites to challenge the God of Death, felling him and taking his place among the pantheon, making of her the first and only living mortal to ascend. The name of this original death god was likewise lost to history. Only the title of his now-godly successor, the {@deity The Matron of Ravens|Exandria|TDCSR|Matron of Ravens}, survives.": "奥术的出现似乎是通往丰饶时代的关键，但也证明了对其构成威胁，因为繁荣很快被贪婪所取代。与其说是普遍的善意和所有人的舒适，{@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|1|Age of Arcanum} 更多地被定义为精英阶层之间无休止的财富和权力争斗，而那些没有魔法的人则在争夺他们的残羹剩饭。令人心动的传言关于一条通往永生之路在最颓废的法师和贵族圈中流传。一位凡人法师，她的名字已经失传，被认为被从历史中抹去，创造了现在被禁止的仪式来挑战死神，将其击败并取而代之，成为首位也是唯一一位升格为神明的凡人。这位原始死神的名字同样在历史中失传。只有他现在神圣的继任者的头衔，{@deity The Matron of Ravens|Exandria|TDCSR|Matron of Ravens}，幸存下来。",
	"Her victory over divinity was a catalyst for many of the horrors of the {@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|1|Age of Arcanum}.

He sought the guidance and power of the banished gods, rending open the gates of their prisons and releasing the Betrayers into the mortal world.": "她对神灵的胜利成为{@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|1|Age of Arcanum}许多恐怖事件的催化剂。一位名为维斯平·克洛拉斯(Vespin Chloras)的大法师，因其财富、技艺和残忍而闻名于古老的瓦瑟海姆(Vasselheim)，受到这一事件的启发。他寻求被放逐的神灵的指引和力量，撕开他们监狱的大门，释放出背叛者进入凡间。",
	"In their imprisonment, these Gods of Hatred and Despair had warped their prisons into reflections of their depravity. The Abyss, once a formless place of chaos, a byproduct of the gods' Creation, was twisted into a place of evil. Countless other planes of cruelty were born from the {@book Betrayer Gods'|TDCSR|2|Betrayer Gods} hatred, and those realms' evil depths endlessly churned forth horrors that lived only to transform peace into suffering, and righteousness into arrogance and greed.": "在他们的囚禁中，这些仇恨与绝望之神已经扭曲了他们的监狱，使之成为其堕落的反映。深渊，曾经是一个无形的混沌之地，是神创造的副产品，被扭曲成了邪恶之地。无数其他的残忍位面从{@book Betrayer Gods'|TDCSR|2|Betrayer Gods}的仇恨中诞生，那些领域的邪恶深处不断涌出只为将和平转变为苦难，将正义转变为傲慢和贪婪的恐怖。",

	"In this land, where the twisted power of the {@book Betrayer Gods'|TDCSR|2|Betrayer Gods} corrupted planes seeped into the world, the lords of evil welcomed mortals whose heartlessness and lust for power made them susceptible to the gods' grand promises.

	"Though much of the city was reduced to rubble, Vasselheim weathered the initial assault, saved by the intervention of their protectors, the metallic dragons, and even a number of the {@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|2|Prime Deities} themselves.

The battle, which pitted gods against mortals and heroes against demons, raged ceaselessly for twenty days and nights, until the dark forces were forced to retreat, their surprise attack thwarted.": "尽管城市的大部分被夷为平地，瓦瑟海姆（Vasselheim）在最初的攻击中幸存下来，得益于他们的守护者，金属龙，甚至还有一些{@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|2|Prime Deities}自己。创造者们降临下来与他们昔日的同胞交战。这场战斗将神祗对抗凡人，英雄对抗恶魔，持续了二十天二十夜，直到黑暗势力被迫撤退，他们的突袭被挫败。",
	"Yet this victory was a tainted one. Evil had been repulsed momentarily, but the revelation of such a terrible foe incited an arcane arms race. Trust was shattered indefinitely: if mortals could fall under the sway of the {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|2|Betrayer Gods}, who could be true allies? If ruin like this could be unleashed under the watchful eyes of divinity, what value did mortal lives hold? Fearing all powers but their own, the most self-interested and singular human arcanists warped their greatest creations, magical instruments of prosperity and joy, into arms and armor of horrific power. The {@book dwarves'|TDCSR|4|dwarves} fascination with rock and earth turned toward isolation as they burrowed further into the mountains, using their divine gifts to animate legions of autonomous golems to protect their ancestral halls. {@book Elves|TDCSR|4|elves} used their understanding of creation's beauty and intricacies to weave spells of unimaginable destructive force, the likes of which Exandria had never before seen.": "然而，这场胜利却带着污点。邪恶暂时被击退，但揭示出如此可怕的敌人引发了一场奥术军备竞赛。信任被永久地粉碎：如果凡人能受到{@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|2|Betrayer Gods}的影响，谁才能成为真正的盟友呢？如果像这样的毁灭可以在神明的眼皮底下被释放，那么凡人的生命又有什么价值呢？最自私、最独断的人类奥术师害怕除了他们自己以外的所有力量，他们将自己最伟大的创造物，原本是繁荣和快乐的魔法器具，扭曲成了具有可怕力量的武器和盔甲。{@book dwarves'|TDCSR|4|dwarves}对岩石和大地的着迷转向了孤立，当他们深入山脉时，利用他们的神圣礼物激活了无数自主傀儡来保护他们的祖先大厅。{@book Elves|TDCSR|4|elves}利用他们对创造之美和复杂性的理解编织了无法想象的毁灭性力量的咒语，这种力量是艾克桑德里亚以前从未见过的。",
	"For the first time since the awakening of the Primordials, the focus of magic was warfare. The gods themselves agreed to join their children on the field of battle, descending from the heavens to take up arms once more for the war now referred to as the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}.": "自原初神灵苏醒以来，魔法的焦点首次转向了战争。众神们同意与他们的子民一起参加战斗，从天堂降临，再次拿起武器，参加如今被称为{@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}的战争。",
	"The sheer magnitude of the energies unleashed in the ensuing battles of gods and mortals frayed the boundaries holding back the elemental chaos, spilling unbridled destruction into the world and bringing utter annihilation. Even the ley lines that direct the flow of magic across Exandria like veins direct blood through the body show signs of being warped by the raw power that the Calamity unleashed. Some well-preserved ruins of the ancient civilizations remain, such as the Drowned City of Cael Morrow in the lands of {@book Marquet|TDCSR|3|Marquet}, but for the most part, all traces of the old world were erased from the face of Exandria.": "在接下来的诸神与凡人之间的战斗中释放出的能量之巨大，使得阻挡元素混沌的边界变得支离破碎，无法无天的毁灭涌入世界，带来了彻底的毁灭。甚至贯穿整个艾克桑德里亚的魔法传输线，就像血管引导血液流动一样，也显示出被灾厄释放的原始力量扭曲的迹象。一些古代文明的遗迹得以保存完好，比如{@book Marquet|TDCSR|3|Marquet}的凯尔莫罗溺城，但大部分时候，旧世界的痕迹都被从艾克桑德里亚的面庞上抹去了。",
	"So great was the loss of life during the war that even liberal estimates suggest no more than a third of Exandria's population survived it.

This proclamation shocked the other {@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|2|Prime Deities} and the beleaguered survivors of the war in equal measure, but while mortals railed against this announcement, the other gods quickly realized that the decision of the two most dutiful and self-sacrificing of their number was unimpeachable and just.": "衡量者的记录声称，{@deity The Platinum Dragon|Exandria|TDCSR|Platinum Dragon}和{@deity The Lawbearer|Exandria|TDCSR|Lawbearer}降临瓦瑟海姆，并做出了一个决定：{@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|2|Prime Deities}将离开这个世界，建立一个神圣之门，永远阻止任何神再次直接影响埃克桑德里亚。这一宣言震惊了其他{@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|2|Prime Deities}和战争中饱受折磨的幸存者，但在凡人们对这一宣布愤怒之际，其他神祇很快意识到，这两位最尽职尽责、最牺牲奉献的神祇的决定是无可置疑的和公正的。",
	"Thus, in hopes of ensuring such ruin would not befall Exandria again, they left their children to rebuild civilization anew within the walls of Vasselheim and beyond.

It appeared in a mystical forest of eternal winter known today as the {@book Frostweald|TDCSR|3|The Frostweald}. From its hibernal abode, this elemental spirit spied upon the untested realm of Tal'Dorei and saw an opportunity.

Their relentless advance covered all they touched in snow and death.": "在接下来的冬至日，艾瑞文(Errevon)撕开了{@book Frostweald|TDCSR|3|The Frostweald}裂隙，并命令他的家园位面无尽的暴风雪肆虐周围繁荣的土地。塔尔多瑞(Tal'Dorei)的南部地区因此削弱，成为冰川军团(Algid Legion)的易宰之物，这支由霜巨人和活着的暴风雪组成的强大军队由冰霜领主(Rimelord)亲自领导。他们无情的前进覆盖了一切，让他们触及的一切都被冰雪和死亡所笼罩。",

	"Yet despite these threats, the legendary heroes of Vox Machina have largely set down their blades, guns, and spells and taken up the mantle of leadership. More than twenty years have passed since their greatest adventures, and though the surviving members of Vox Machina are still canny rulers and cunning warriors, the {@book Tal'Dorei Council|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council} can no longer rely upon their skills as readily as they once did.

	"However, there are a number of cults who yearn to circumvent this barrier and summon their dark patron onto the Material Plane. Others still seek to unravel the forgotten rites of ascension, just as the {@deity The Matron of Ravens|Exandria|TDCSR|Matron of Ravens} did in ancient times—just as {@deity The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR} did in living memory. What would happen if an omnipotent deity somehow managed to arise on the mortal side of the Divine Gate? Or even simply managed to fool the gods into thinking they had done so? Would the gods of good be forced to unleash their powers as one to break the Gate, unleashing another {@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity} upon the world?": "然而，有许多异教团体渴望绕过这个屏障，将他们的黑暗主人召唤到物质位面上。还有一些人试图解开被遗忘的升天仪式，就像古代的{@deity The Matron of Ravens|Exandria|TDCSR|Matron of Ravens}一样——就像近年来的{@deity The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR}一样。如果一位全能的神灵设法在神圣之门的凡间一侧出现，会发生什么？甚至只是成功愚弄众神让他们认为自己已经这样做了？善神们会被迫释放他们的力量来打破这扇门，释放另一个{@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}到世界上吗？",

Players looking for fantasy intrigue can meddle in the internal politics of the city of {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship} and root out corruption within the council, which may have been planted by any number of this land's power-hungry factions, from the invasive crime syndicate known as the {@book Myriad|TDCSR|2|The Myriad} to the shadowy mages within the {@book Arcana Pansophical|TDCSR|2|Arcana Pansophical} who splintered off into a new schismatic faction, the {@book League of Miracles|TDCSR|2|League of Miracles}.": "虽然幻想政治并非每位玩家的菜，但初生共和国的挣扎可以起到几个作用。寻求幻想阴谋的玩家可以干预{@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}城市的内部政治，并清除议会内部的腐败，这些腐败可能是由这片土地上众多渴望权力的派系之一植入的，从侵略性犯罪集团{@book Myriad|TDCSR|2|The Myriad}到{@book Arcana Pansophical|TDCSR|2|Arcana Pansophical}内的神秘法师，他们分裂出一个新的教派，{@book League of Miracles|TDCSR|2|League of Miracles}。",
	"Game Masters can also use political elements to flavor or provide a backdrop for their otherwise action-focused games. On a smaller scale, corrupt margraves may hire bandits to pillage their own villages, requiring heroes to step in. On a broader scale, a threat to the stability of the Republic of Tal'Dorei itself may force the characters to stop a megalomaniac bent on conquering the republic from within.": "游戏主持人也可以利用政治元素来为他们本来以行动为重点的游戏增添趣味或提供背景。在较小的范围内，腐败的边境守护者可能会雇佣土匪来掠夺自己的村庄，需要英雄们介入。在更广泛的范围内，对塔尔多瑞共和国稳定的威胁可能会迫使角色们阻止一个企图从内部征服共和国的狂热分子。",
	"A criminal syndicate known as the {@book Clasp|TDCSR|2|The Clasp} has lurked in Tal'Dorei's underworld since the foundation of the old Tal'Dorei Empire.

	"Long before the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}, a great civilization called the Qoniira made {@book Rifenmist|TDCSR|3|Rifenmist Peninsula} their home. During the {@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|1|Age of Arcanum}, the Qoniira Tetrarchy grew from a loose coalition of towns led by arcanists, clerics of the {@deity The Wildmother|Exandria|TDCSR|Wildmother}, and druids who spoke with the jungle around them. These towns were inhabited by {@book humans|TDCSR|4|humans} and the animal-bodied humanoids of the jungle. The first stones of the Qoniiran heart-city Niirdal-Poc were laid by the broad, towering {@race Loxodon|GGR|elephantine people}, and places for new settlements were scouted out by {@book Catfolk|TDCSR|6|Catfolk} seers whose eyes glistened with starlight.": "在{@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}之前，一个名为库尼拉(Qoniira)的伟大文明将{@book Rifenmist|TDCSR|3|Rifenmist Peninsula}视为他们的家园。在{@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|1|Age of Arcanum}期间，库尼拉四治联盟从一群由秘术师、{@deity The Wildmother|Exandria|TDCSR|Wildmother}的神职人员和与周围丛林交谈的德鲁伊领导的城镇松散联盟中崛起。这些城镇居住着{@book humans|TDCSR|4|humans}和丛林中身体呈动物形态的人类。库尼拉心脏城市尼尔达尔-波克(Niirdal-Poc)的第一块石头是由宽广高大的{@race Loxodon|GGR|elephantine people}铺设的，而新定居点则由眼睛闪烁着星光的{@book Catfolk|TDCSR|6|Catfolk}先知们勘察确定。",
	"In time, the Qoniira civilization grew into a Tetrarchy, with four great satellite cities and the central heart-city of {@book Niirdal-Poc|TDCSR|3|Niirdal-Poc}. The tetrarchs established their cities with mathematical precision. A constellation of the night sky guided them—Surrac's Shield, a four-starred diamond with a fifth star in its center.

	"This outer city, east of {@book Niirdal-Poc|TDCSR|3|Niirdal-Poc}, was an academic center of the Qoniiran civilization.

It is adorned with statues of the {@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|2|Prime Deities} and the {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|2|Betrayer Gods} alike, and none living know what is inside its unbreachable walls. Even today, modern Qoniiran priests teach that balance is the true way of the world, telling their people to invoke the names of the {@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|2|Prime Deities} for blessings, and of the {@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|2|Betrayer Gods} for curses.": "位于{@book Niirdal-Poc|TDCSR|3|Niirdal-Poc}以南，这座外城曾是Qoniirans信仰的中心。神圣城市的遗迹仅剩下一个巨大的漂浮立方体，名为Sarqet的六面体。它装饰着{@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|2|Prime Deities}和{@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|2|Betrayer Gods}的雕像，活着的人都不知道其坚不可摧的墙壁内部是什么。即使在今天，现代Qoniiran祭司也教导人们平衡是世界的真正之道，告诉他们祈求{@book Prime Deities|TDCSR|2|Prime Deities}的名号会得到祝福，而{@book Betrayer Gods|TDCSR|2|Betrayer Gods}的名号会带来诅咒。",

Some statues have been known to move under the light of the stars, illuminating hidden runes upon their bodies as they patrol like sentinels of antiquity.": "所有这些废墟都充满了来自Qoniiran四治时期鼎盛时期的雕像。一些雕像据说会在星光下移动，照亮他们身上隐藏的符文，宛如古代的哨兵巡逻一般。",

	"The relative autonomy of the four outer cities and the looseness of the coalition that bound them seems at odds with the perfect precision with which the cities were built, so precisely matching the stars in the sky. The Qoniirans have always been an easygoing people who typically follow the flow of fate, rather than fight against it.": "四个外城市的相对自治和将它们联系在一起的联盟的松散似乎与这些城市建造时的完美精度不符，它们与天空中的星星如此精确地匹配。库尼尔人一直是一个随遇而安的民族，通常顺应命运的潮流，而不是与之抗争。",
	"Today, the tetrarchy survives, even though the four outer cities are in ruins. They gather daily in the Hakredic Dome, an architecturally magnificent granite rotunda adorned with an outer layer of grayish-purple porphyry stone and lifelike, reddish porphyry statues. There, the tetrarchs and their advisors work to keep life simple and content for their people.": "今天，四分统治体（the tetrarchy）仍然存在，尽管四个外围城市已经荒废。他们每天聚集在哈克雷迪克圆顶（Hakredic Dome），这是一座建筑壮丽的花岗岩圆形建筑，外层覆盖着灰紫色斑岩石，还有栩栩如生的红色斑岩雕像。在那里，四分统治者和他们的顾问们努力工作，为人民保持简单而幸福的生活。",
	"The tetrarchy is a hereditary office, but citywide elections are held between eligible heirs to determine which heir should take up their parent's mantle. Elections are also held when a tetrarch's line ends without heirs—often giving advisors a chance to gain power by virtue of their service to the city.": "四治制是一个世袭职位，但在符合条件的继承人之间举行全市选举，以确定哪位继承人应该接替其父母的职位。当一个四治制的血脉在没有继承人的情况下终结时，也会举行选举——这往往给了顾问们通过他们对城市的服务获得权力的机会。",

	"To come into prominence within the tribe, or request admittance into the tribes as an ally or member, a hopeful entrant must complete a series of ceremonial trials. These trials change from dura to dura, but are designed to test strength of body and mind. It is not uncommon for those who attempt these trials to return maimed, or to not return at all, and many elders bear the marks and scars of their trials long past. Few outlanders from the north, known as orfindes to the Orroyen, have been allowed into any of the dozens of Orroyen tribes, and the elders have little intention of changing this, for they have heard distant tales of the ancient tyranny of {@book Drassig|TDCSR|1|The Iron Rule of Drassig} and the supernatural horrors the people of northern {@book Gwessar|TDCSR|1|Gwessar} invite upon themselves.": "为了在部落中崭露头角，或请求作为盟友或成员加入部落，一个有希望的候选人必须完成一系列的仪式试炼。这些试炼因部落而异，但旨在测试身体和心灵的力量。那些尝试这些试炼的人常常会返回时受伤，或者干脆不再返回，许多长者身上仍留有他们早年试炼的痕迹和伤疤。来自北方的少数外来者，被奥罗伊人称为{@book Drassig|TDCSR|1|The Iron Rule of Drassig}，被允许加入奥罗伊部落中的情况并不多见，长者们也没有打算改变这一点，因为他们听说过远古{@book Drassig|TDCSR|1|The Iron Rule of Drassig}的暴政以及北方{@book Gwessar|TDCSR|1|Gwessar}人民招致的超自然恐怖。",
	"Nevertheless, the Orroyen are practical, not prideful. They trade often with the Free Folk of Mornset, and sometimes even travel as far north as {@book Byroden|TDCSR|3|Byroden} to trade rare goods.

	"Though their conditions were still meager when the magnanimous {@book Zan Tal'Dorei|TDCSR|1|Tal'Dorei Ascendant} ended {@book Drassig's|TDCSR|1|The Iron Rule of Drassig} iron rule, the city's denizens chose to remain, having created a community with its own culture of inexpensive living and brotherhood in poverty, away from the bustle of the city's inner streets. A microcosm of {@book Emonian|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship} society now exists within the city of Outwall, including its own trade square, shrines for worship, and makeshift farms on the outskirts. As early as two decades ago, Outwall was called the Upper Slums—a derogatory name given to it by {@book Emon's|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship} Cloudtop elite. People within Outwall tried to transform the term \"Upper Slums\" into a symbol of civic pride, but it never stuck. The name Outwall eventually emerged after community leaders demanded an audience with the {@book Tal'Dorei Council|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council} in an event that came to be called the Outer Wall Debates—for they demanded the council convene in the slums' own town square.": "尽管在宽宏大量的{@book Zan Tal'Dorei|TDCSR|1|Tal'Dorei Ascendant}结束{@book Drassig's|TDCSR|1|The Iron Rule of Drassig}铁腕统治时，城市居民的生活条件仍十分艰难，但他们选择留下来，创造了一个具有自己文化特色的社区，以廉价生活和贫困中的兄弟情谊为特点，远离城市内街道的喧嚣。现在，在Outwall城中存在着{@book Emonian|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}社会的一个缩影，包括自己的贸易广场、供奉的神龛和郊区的临时农场。早在二十年前，Outwall被称为上层贫民窟——这是{@book Emon's|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship} Cloudtop 精英给予的贬义称呼。Outwall内的人们试图将“上层贫民窟”这个词转变为市民自豪的象征，但并没有成功。最终，Outwall这个名字是在社区领袖要求与{@book Tal'Dorei Council|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council}进行会谈时出现的，这次事件被称为外墙辩论—因为他们要求议会在贫民窟自己的市政广场上开会。",
	"These days, Outwall is becoming a trendy place to live, thanks to its vibrant culture and relatively inexpensive housing. Its locals are fighting hard to keep young people with money to burn from the {@book Central District|TDCSR|3|Central District} from gentrifying their home.

It first formed when a large refugee band from {@book Othanzia|TDCSR|3|Issylra} was barred entry into the city in the midst of the {@book Scattered War|TDCSR|1|The Scattered War}. Instead of dispersing, they decided to lay down roots while {@book Drassig's|TDCSR|1|The Iron Rule of Drassig} armies were out fighting a losing battle against {@book Zan Tal'Dorei|TDCSR|1|Tal'Dorei Ascendant}.

Likewise, the natural defenses of the surrounding mountains make their lands easily defensible. For centuries, the idea that the empire is invincible has fueled recruitment propaganda for its military, the sanctimoniously titled Righteous Brand.

Those who are reincarnated seek to broaden the knowledge of the {@deity The Lost Beacon of Unknown Light|Exandria|TDCSR|Luxon} by living bold lives and gaining new experiences.

And if you like, you can take this even further in your games and say that any fantasy creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher is capable of free thought, and should have just as wide a range of alignments as other sapient beings.": "Tal'Dorei的人形生物并非如此设定。任何具有人形类型的生物都是有思想、有感情的个体。具有龙类、巨人类或仙灵类类型的生物也明确具有智慧，因此可以有任何属性。一个人类是中立邪恶{@creature bandit} 的可能性与一只兽人是混乱善良{@creature swashbuckler|VGM} 的可能性一样大，或者一个{@creature hobgoblin} 是守序善良{@creature knight} 的可能性一样大。如果你愿意，在游戏中甚至可以进一步说，任何智力分数达到6或更高的幻想生物都有自由思考的能力，并且应该有与其他有智慧的生物一样广泛的属性范围。",
	"The stories in {@i Critical Role} are filled with shades of moral gray, but Tal'Dorei still has plenty of unambiguously evil creatures. Most demons, devils, and undead are suffused with cosmic evil, and always try to subvert righteousness. Likewise, unthinking creatures such as oozes and constructs, and creatures of instinctual intelligence such as beasts, many monstrosities, and plant creatures, all make morally unambiguous foes.": "{@i Critical Role}中的故事充满了道德上的灰色地带，但塔尔多蕾（Tal'Dorei）仍然有许多明显邪恶的生物。大多数恶魔、恶魔和不死生物都充满了宇宙邪恶，总是试图颠覆正义。同样，像软泥怪和构造物这样的无思维生物，以及像野兽、许多畸变生物和植物生物这样具有本能智慧的生物，都是明显邪恶的敌人。",
	"Likewise, there are plenty of evil humanoids in the world. Cultists of evil gods, including the {@book Remnants|TDCSR|2|The Remnants} who worship {@deity The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR}, and merciless, blood-soaked bandits such as the {@book Ravagers|TDCSR|4|Ravagers} are clear and immediate threats to both the safety of the player characters and all free peoples of Tal'Dorei. Depending on the tone of your story, the characters might cut such foes down without mercy—or they might try to rehabilitate them. The difference is that these villains' choices, not their ancestries, determine whether or not they are evil.": "同样，世界上有许多邪恶的人类。邪恶神的信徒，包括崇拜{@deity The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR}的{@book Remnants|TDCSR|2|The Remnants}，以及无情、血腥的强盗，比如{@book Ravagers|TDCSR|4|Ravagers}，都是对玩家角色的安全以及塔尔多瑞所有自由人民的明显和直接威胁。根据你故事的基调，角色们可能会毫不留情地剿灭这些敌人，或者他们可能会试图改造他们。不同之处在于这些恶棍的选择，而不是他们的血统，决定了他们是否是邪恶的。",
	"The various peoples of Tal'Dorei don't have racial cultures. Rather, someone's culture is based on the cities and regions in which they spend their formative years. For most of Tal'Dorei's history, members of the different fantasy races lived in largely monolithic enclaves. However, the more recent past has instilled in people the need to break down old barriers, work together, and live together.": "Tal'Dorei（塔尔多雷）的各个种族并没有种族文化。相反，一个人的文化是基于他们在成长时期所度过的城市和地区。在大部分塔尔多雷的历史中，不同幻想种族的成员生活在基本上是单一的飞地中。然而，最近的过去已经灌输给人们打破旧障碍、共同努力、共同生活的需要。",
	"All cities and large towns have a majority population of certain races, typically based on the peoples who founded those settlements. This includes such notable sites as the elf-majority city-state of {@book Syngorn|TDCSR|3|Syngorn} and the dwarf-majority city-state of {@book Kraghammer|TDCSR|3|Kraghammer}. Some people in Tal'Dorei might assume that certain races have common cultural traits that unite them, but many others know that this isn't the whole truth. A dwarf raised in {@book Kraghammer|TDCSR|3|Kraghammer} and a dwarf raised in {@book Stilben|TDCSR|3|Stilben} are likely to have very different attitudes about family, food, faith, and all the other factors that make up a culture.": "所有的城市和大城镇都有特定种族的多数人口，通常是基于建立这些定居点的人民。这包括一些著名地点，如以精灵为主体的城邦 {@book Syngorn|TDCSR|3|Syngorn} 和以矮人为主体的城邦 {@book Kraghammer|TDCSR|3|Kraghammer}。在塔尔多瑞，一些人可能会假设某些种族有共同的文化特征将他们团结在一起，但许多其他人知道这并不完全属实。一个在 {@book Kraghammer|TDCSR|3|Kraghammer} 长大的矮人和一个在 {@book Stilben|TDCSR|3|Stilben} 长大的矮人可能在家庭、食物、信仰等方面有非常不同的态度，这些因素构成了文化。",
	"Even when people of the same race gather in neighborhoods within a city, those people don't necessarily share the common culture of their best-known homelands. In many neighborhoods in the great city of {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}, for example, {@book elves|TDCSR|4|elves} and half-elves are a majority.

	"That said, beings with distinctly magical traits often form cultures that include their unique abilities. This includes folk such as {@book dragonblood|TDCSR|4|dragonblood}, with their ability to channel elemental power.

	"The dragonblood of Exandria are a people of unknown origin, and countless myths surround their ancestral creation. One particularly pervasive tale states that dragonblood were created by the {@deity The Scaled Tyrant|Exandria|TDCSR|Scaled Tyrant} and the {@deity The Platinum Dragon|Exandria|TDCSR|Platinum Dragon} during the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}, serving as loyal soldiers who eventually earned their freedom.

	"Today, dragonblood live all over Exandria, though they remain a scarcer sight in Tal'Dorei than in {@book Wildemount|TDCSR|3|Wildemount}. Their spread across the world was hastened by the assault against the free peoples of Exandria by the {@book Chroma Conclave|TDCSR|1|The Chroma Conclave}. During that conflict, the ancient white dragon known as Vorugal the Frigid Doom destroyed the magical city-state of Draconia, the ancestral homeland of most dragonblood.": "如今，龙血族遍布整个艾克桑德利亚（Exandria），尽管在塔尔多雷（Tal'Dorei）地区的出现比{@book Wildemount|TDCSR|3|Wildemount}要少见。他们在世界各地的传播受到了{@book Chroma Conclave|TDCSR|1|The Chroma Conclave}对艾克桑德利亚自由民族的攻击的推动。在那场冲突中，被称为“冰霜厄运”的古老白龙沃鲁加尔（Vorugal）摧毁了魔法城邦德拉科尼亚（Draconia），这是大多数龙血族的祖先故土。",
	"The destruction of Draconia and the loss of many of its people was a tragedy. But to roughly half the dragonblood of Exandria, it also marked the end of an oppressive regime. Dragonblood of Exandria can either be born with a tail or without. In Draconia, those with tails were called draconians or draconbloods, for they were seen as closer in form and power to true dragons. Those without tails were given the name of ravenites and enslaved. Their blood and toil built the mighty towers of Draconia, yet the ravenites enjoyed none of their city's splendor.": "德拉科尼亚的毁灭和许多人的丧生是一场悲剧。但对于艾克桑德里亚的龙血族约一半的人来说，这也标志着一个压迫政权的终结。艾克桑德里亚的龙血族可能出生时带有尾巴，也可能没有。在德拉科尼亚，那些有尾巴的人被称为龙人或龙血族，因为他们被视为形态和力量更接近真龙。没有尾巴的人被称为渡鸦人并被奴役。他们的血汗建造了德拉科尼亚的强大塔楼，然而渡鸦人却没有享受到城市的辉煌。",
	"The ruin of Draconia thus marked the start of an era of freedom and self-determination for the ravenites. In Tal'Dorei, it's apparent that any differences between the ravenites and the draconians have nothing to do with bloodline or draconic power. Those differences are cultural, and rooted in a past whose conflicts still haven't been resolved. The oppression that existed in Draconia remains largely unknown within Tal'Dorei to this day, and outside of major cities such as {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}, dragonblood can go for months, even years, without seeing another of their kind.": "因此，龙之废墟标志着乌鸦人开始了一个自由和自决的时代。在塔尔多瑞（Tal'Dorei），很明显，乌鸦人和龙人之间的任何差异都与血统或龙之力量无关。这些差异是文化上的，并根植于一个过去，其冲突仍未得到解决。在塔尔多瑞，龙之废墟中存在的压迫直到今天仍然大多未知，在像{@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}这样的大城市之外，龙血族可能会数月甚至数年不见自己族人。",
	"The tail-bearing draconians who survived the destruction of Draconia have been scattered across the world. In the time that's passed since the fall of the {@book dragonblood|TDCSR|4|dragonblood} city-state, a generation of draconbloods have grown up in Tal'Dorei's towns and cities, disconnected from their parents' privileged upbringing. Only a scant few draconians—typically ones able to teleport away from Vorugal's attack—escaped with any sort of wealth. Most other refugees were lucky simply to escape with their lives.": "在龙巢的毁灭中幸存下来的尾巴龙人已经散落在世界各地。自从{@book dragonblood|TDCSR|4|dragonblood}城邦的陨落以来，一代龙血族在塔尔多瑞的城镇中长大，与父母的特权成长背景脱节。只有极少数的龙人——通常是能够从沃鲁加尔的袭击中传送离开的人——带着某种财富逃脱。大多数其他难民幸运地只是带着性命逃出。",
	"A social divide continues to grow between draconians who have wealth and those who don't. Many of those with wealth greedily cling to the shadows of their former tyrannical glory, but other draconians seek instead to bury the past and create their own destiny, on their own merits.": "在龙裔中，财富悬殊不断加剧，一部分拥有财富的龙裔贪婪地依附于他们昔日暴虐的荣耀阴影之下，而另一部分龙裔则选择埋葬过去，凭借自己的努力创造属于自己的命运。",
	"Following the end of the Draconian order, the ravenites ventured into the world eager to make the most of their newfound freedom. In the generation since, many have formed a new homeland in Xhorhas known as Xarzith Kitril, content to reclaim the lands of their birth. Those ravenites who departed {@book Wildemount|TDCSR|3|Wildemount} have found a new home in the cities and the icy north of Tal'Dorei, where they enjoy the freedom and privileges of equality that this land provides.": "在龙族秩序结束后，渴望充分享受新获自由的渡鸦人踏上了探索世界的旅程。自那时起的这一代人中，许多人在以萨西斯·基特里尔(Xhorhas)为知名的新家园中定居，满心欢喜地重新夺回了他们的故土。那些离开{@book Wildemount|TDCSR|3|Wildemount}的渡鸦人则在塔尔多瑞(Tal'Dorei)的城市和冰冷的北部找到了新家园，在那里他们享受着这片土地提供的自由和平等的特权。",
	"Most ravenite children grew up poor, either in slum towns at the edges of cities like {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship} and {@book Westruun|TDCSR|3|Westruun}, or helping their parents laboriously carve out rural lives in the {@book Dividing Plains|TDCSR|3|Dividing Plains} or {@book Cliffkeep Mountains|TDCSR|3|Cliffkeep Mountains}.": "大多数乌鸦族的孩子在贫困中长大，要么生活在像{@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}和{@book Westruun|TDCSR|3|Westruun}这样的城市边缘的贫民镇，要么帮助父母在{@book Dividing Plains|TDCSR|3|Dividing Plains}或{@book Cliffkeep Mountains|TDCSR|3|Cliffkeep Mountains}艰苦地开拓农村生活。",
	"When the world was nearly rent asunder by the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}, the {@book dwarves|TDCSR|4|dwarves} of Tal'Dorei disappeared underground to wait out the worst of the conflict.

In the centuries following the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}, these dwarf clans, isolated beneath the surface of Exandria, gathered into a single, steadfast redoubt: {@book Kraghammer|TDCSR|3|Kraghammer}.

	"Another clan, the Lightfoots, asserted that all {@book humans|TDCSR|4|humans} couldn't be condemned for the evil actions of one king, and pointed to the thousands of halflings and other non-humans who had allied themselves with {@book Drassig's|TDCSR|1|The Iron Rule of Drassig} evil regime as proof. The Lightfoots advocated protecting as many people as possible while waiting the war out. In the end, it became clear to both halfling clans that in a conflict against a tyrant such as {@book Drassig|TDCSR|1|The Iron Rule of Drassig}, neutrality was not an option. They banded together behind {@book Zan Tal'Dorei's|TDCSR|1|Tal'Dorei Ascendant} banner of rebellion.": "另一个家族，轻足氏族(Lightfoots)，坚称不能因为一个国王的邪恶行为就谴责所有{@book humans|TDCSR|4|humans}，并指出成千上万的半身人和其他非人类与{@book Drassig's|TDCSR|1|The Iron Rule of Drassig}邪恶政权结盟，作为证据。轻足氏族主张在等待战争结束时保护尽可能多的人。最终，两个半身人家族都清楚地意识到，在与暴君如{@book Drassig|TDCSR|1|The Iron Rule of Drassig}的冲突中，中立不是一个选择。他们团结在{@book Zan Tal'Dorei's|TDCSR|1|Tal'Dorei Ascendant}反抗旗帜下。",
	"These two clans dissolved after the {@book Scattered War|TDCSR|1|The Scattered War}, but many contemporary halfling families can trace their genealogies back to one or the other, and proudly proclaim that their great-grandparents were there when history was being made.

	"The Lightfoot Clan dissolved into its many component families after the war, but the spirit that created the clan still survives. Those {@book halflings|TDCSR|4|halflings} who strongly identify with their Lightfoot identity look out for number one first, and are more likely to try to evade conflict than to meet an oncoming storm head-on. Yet a contradiction lingers within the Lightfoot spirit, for despite all their love of the comforts of home, many Lightfoot {@book halflings|TDCSR|4|halflings} feel a certain unquenchable hunger to explore. Many adventuring {@book halflings|TDCSR|4|halflings} are Lightfoots who have given in to this compulsion.": "在战争之后，光足氏族解散为许多分支家族，但创立氏族的精神仍然存在。那些强烈认同自己光足身份的{@book halflings|TDCSR|4|halflings}人首先关心自己，并更倾向于回避冲突而不是迎头面对即将到来的风暴。然而，光足精神中存在着矛盾，尽管他们热爱家庭的舒适，许多光足{@book halflings|TDCSR|4|halflings}却感到一种无法抑制的探索渴望。许多冒险{@book halflings|TDCSR|4|halflings}者都是屈服于这种冲动的光足人。",
	"The Stoutheart Clan also dissolved in the wake of the {@book Scattered War|TDCSR|1|The Scattered War}, but its ideals and identity still endure. Brashness and courage even in the face of absurd odds embodies the Stoutheart spirit. Recalling the guerilla army that stood against the legions of {@book Drassig|TDCSR|1|The Iron Rule of Drassig}, any halfling with the fortitude to stand up to a warrior three times their size has more than earned the honor of calling themself a Stoutheart—even if their family tree doesn't have true roots in that historic clan.": "在{@book Scattered War|TDCSR|1|The Scattered War}的余波中，坚韧之心族也解散了，但其理念和身份仍然存在。即使面对荒谬的机会，勇敢和勇气体现了坚韧之心的精神。回想起那支抵抗{@book Drassig|TDCSR|1|The Iron Rule of Drassig}军团的游击军，任何一个有勇气面对比自己大三倍的战士的半身人都已经赢得了称呼自己为坚韧之心的荣誉，即使他们的家族谱系并没有真正的根源于那个历史悠久的家族。",
	"Stouthearts often surprise other people who know of {@book halflings|TDCSR|4|halflings} only from experiences with more laidback Lightfoot folk—and many use this surprise to their advantage to become truly cunning diplomats. The proud Stoutheart named Assum Emring, a former member of the {@book Tal'Dorei Council|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council}, once boisterously claimed that he was so rude, so brash and so defiant in his first meeting with the late Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei II, that he was very nearly arrested—before being offered a position on the sovereign's staff the very next day!": "坚毅之心的人经常会让其他只了解{@book halflings|TDCSR|4|halflings}来自更悠闲的莱特富特族群的人感到惊讶——许多人会利用这种惊讶来成为真正狡猾的外交家。自豪的坚毅之心人艾瑟姆·埃姆林，曾是{@book Tal'Dorei Council|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council}的成员，曾经大声宣称他在与已故国王乌里尔·塔尔多雷二世的第一次会面中表现得如此粗鲁、咄咄逼人和目中无人，以至于几乎被逮捕——但在第二天就被提供了加入国王团队的职位！",

Most cultures of Exandria have legends of those marked by ill fate simply by being born under the full light of Ruidus, the vermilion moon around which countless fell legends swirl.": "少数命运之子意识到自己的卓越本质。没有神明本身的确认，很少有人能确定自己拥有这份祝福。这正是应该的，因为名声显赫、权势滔天的人很容易嫉妒那些天赋超越自己的人。{@book Age of Arcanum|TDCSR|1|Age of Arcanum}的幸存编年史中充满了关于魔法统治者的故事，他们奴役那些被视为命运之子的人，甚至更糟的是，试图以最可怕的手段从他们身上提取命运的本质。被命运触摸可以是一种祝福，也可以是一种诅咒。通常那些拥有幸运祝福的人最终会被历史记住，而那些被命运诅咒的人则会被遗忘。艾克桑德里亚的大多数文化都有传说，讲述了那些因在绯红月魄鲁伊德斯的明亮下出生而被不幸命运标记的人。",
	"Player characters and NPCs gain this blessing by having the GM grant it to them, gaining the {@reward Fortune's Grace|TDCSR} feature as a result. A character might receive the blessing as a gift from the gods, or as a temporary and surprising phenomenon when the campaign shifts into a story arc focused on that character. An NPC ally might bear this blessing to help them survive as the characters protect them from a terrible threat. A previously benign NPC might even become a power-hungry villain as they test the limits of their fate-touched gift.": "玩家角色和NPC通过GM授予他们这个祝福来获得，结果获得{@reward Fortune's Grace|TDCSR}特性。角色可能会作为神的礼物获得这个祝福，或者在战役转向以该角色为焦点的故事情节时，会出现这种临时而令人惊讶的现象。NPC盟友可能会拥有这个祝福，以帮助他们在角色保护他们免受可怕威胁时生存下来。甚至以前善良的NPC可能会因测试他们命运之触礼物的极限而变成贪求权力的恶棍。",
	"The following feats are appropriate for a Tal'Dorei campaign.": "以下的特长适用于塔尔多雷(Tal'Dorei)战役。",
	"Game Masters can make use of many different tools to run enjoyable games. A GM is the starting point of the storytelling process, coming up with narratively compelling adventure frameworks that they and the players then turn into a campaign. To do so, a GM works up locations and scenarios that their players will have fun with. They stock adventures with loot and magic items to reward daring characters, villains and monsters to defend those valuable treasures, and NPCs of all kinds who can give clues, help as allies, or oppose the characters in their goals.": "游戏主持人可以利用许多不同的工具来运行愉快的游戏。GM(游戏主持人)是叙事过程的起点，构思具有叙事吸引力的冒险框架，然后与玩家们一起将其转化为一个战役。为此，GM(游戏主持人)设计地点和情景，让玩家们能够享受其中。他们为冒险提供战利品和魔法物品，以奖励勇敢的角色，提供守卫这些宝贵宝藏的反派和怪物，以及各种NPC，他们可以提供线索，作为盟友帮助，或者反对角色们的目标。",
	"This chapter contains storytelling advice for GMs running campaigns in Tal'Dorei. It also contains a number of new magic items, including the legendary {@book Vestiges of Divergence|TDCSR|5|Vestiges of Divergence}, plus {@filter optional rules|variantrules|Source=TDCSR} that GMs can use to fine-tune the tone of a Tal'Dorei campaign.

	"Before reading this section, you should familiarize yourself with \"{@book Running a Tal'Dorei Campaign|TDCSR|1|Running a Tal'Dorei Campaign}\" in {@book chapter 1|TDCSR|1}, which provides information about Tal'Dorei's lore and conflicts that are for the Game Master's eyes only. {@book Chapter 3|TDCSR|3} of this book also contains dozens of specific story hooks, many of which tie into the big-picture secrets introduced in {@book chapter 1|TDCSR|1}. Some hooks are simple, giving you just enough to inspire your next game session. Some are more complex, and can cascade into an entire campaign's worth of story.": "在阅读本节之前，您应该熟悉{@book Running a Tal'Dorei Campaign|TDCSR|1|Running a Tal'Dorei Campaign}在{@book chapter 1|TDCSR|1}中的用法，该用法提供了关于塔尔多瑞（Tal'Dorei）的传说和冲突信息，仅供主持人查看。本书的{@book Chapter 3|TDCSR|3}部分还包含了数十个具体的故事引子，其中许多与{@book chapter 1|TDCSR|1}中引入的大局秘密相关。一些引子很简单，仅提供足够的灵感来启发您下一场游戏会话。有些则更复杂，可以延伸成整个活动的价值故事。",
	"You'll notice that these story hooks present a beginning, and sometimes a hint of a middle, but never a conclusion. That's because they're designed to spark your imagination, but in a way that still leaves you to fill out the rest of the story framework in your own way. The goal of this book is to provide the building blocks with which you can create your own Tal'Dorei, and these open-ended plot seeds will help you set up adventures that feel right at home in the world of {@i Critical Role}—whether you're a longtime fan of the show or are brand-new to Tal'Dorei.": "您会注意到这些故事引子呈现了一个开端，有时还会暗示一些中间情节，但从不给出结局。这是因为它们旨在激发您的想象力，但又以一种方式留给您自己填补故事框架的其余部分。这本书的目标是为您提供构建元素，让您可以创作自己的塔尔多瑞，而这些开放式情节种子将帮助您设置在{@i Critical Role}世界中感觉自然的冒险——无论您是这个节目的忠实粉丝还是全新接触塔尔多瑞的人。",
	"If you're an experienced GM, you might already have your own approach to creating adventures from story hooks. But especially if you're a beginning GM, this section presents a straightforward approach you can try out for expanding hooks into full adventures. And even as an experienced GM, if you ever feel stuck while planning an adventure, it can help to create a \"fill-in-the-blanks\" outline of your narrative. Start by dividing a page of your GM journal (whether it's a physical page or a digital one) into three sections labeled \"Beginning,\" \"Middle,\" and \"End.\" Then think about what happens in each of those parts of your adventure as a means of opening up your creative process.": "如果你是一位经验丰富的(`GM`)，你可能已经有自己的方式来从故事线索中创作冒险。但特别是作为一名初学者(`GM`)，本节提供了一个简单的方法，供你尝试将线索扩展为完整的冒险。即使作为一名经验丰富的(`GM`)，如果在计划冒险时感到困惑，创建一个\"填空\"大纲来概述你的叙事可能会有所帮助。首先，将你的(`GM`)日志的一页（无论是实体页面还是数字页面）分成三个部分，标记为\"开始\"，\"中间\"和\"结尾\"。然后考虑在冒险的每个部分中发生了什么，作为打开你的创造过程的手段。",
	"The beginning of most adventures comes when the characters receive a quest or are plunged headfirst into an unexpected scenario. In the Beginning section of your GM journal, write one sentence about how you want the characters to learn of the adventure. For example: \"A member of the {@book Tal'Dorei Council|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council} posts an urgent notice about a dangerous creature in every tavern in {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}, promising a 1,000 gp reward.\" Then write down little notes about other things you want in the beginning scene. Where is this opening scene set? What other NPCs are there? Are there environmental notes or clues you want to communicate to the players?": "大多数冒险的开始都是角色接到任务或突然陷入意想不到的情境。在你的GM日志的“开始”部分，写下一句关于你希望角色如何得知冒险的句子。例如：“{@book Tal'Dorei Council|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council}的一名成员在{@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}的每家酒馆发布了一份关于危险生物的紧急通告，承诺奖励1,000金币。”然后写下关于开始场景中其他想要的事情的小笔记。这个开场场景设置在哪里？还有哪些其他NPC在那里？有环境笔记或线索你想传达给玩家吗？",
	"The middle of an adventure is filled with conflict, whether episodic events during travel, a dungeon exploration filled with deadly traps and territorial monsters, or intense diplomatic negotiations. In the Middle section, write down notes about what sort of conflict you want your adventure to have. Most story hooks in this book contain a clear antagonist or threat—so start by writing down that antagonist and then brainstorming secondary threats that will challenge the characters on their way to facing their main foe. In addition to the monsters in {@book chapter 6|TDCSR|6} of this book, the fifth edition rules are filled with useful monsters that are perfectly at home in Exandria.": "在冒险的中段充满了冲突，无论是旅途中的分散事件、充满致命陷阱和领地怪物的地牢探险，还是紧张的外交谈判。在中间部分，记下你希望冒险中出现的冲突类型。本书中的大多数故事引子都包含一个明确的反派或威胁，所以首先写下那个反派，然后进行头脑风暴，想出会在角色面对主要敌人之前挑战他们的次要威胁。除了本书中的怪物外，第五版规则中还有许多有用的怪物，它们在{@book chapter 6|TDCSR|6}中完全适合在Exandria中使用。",
	"The end of an adventure is where the characters gain their reward and return to safety. In the Ending section of your journal, write down ideas for treasure or other rewards that you want to give the characters. You can make use of the new treasures featured in this book, as well as the {@5etools varied rewards described in the fifth edition rules|lootgen.html}.": "冒险的结束是角色获得奖励并返回安全的地方。在你的日志的结束部分，写下你想要给角色的宝藏或其他奖励的想法。你可以利用本书中提供的新宝藏，以及{@5etools varied rewards described in the fifth edition rules|lootgen.html}。",
	"Remember that treasure doesn't have to be gold or magic items, and it doesn't have to be found in a dungeon. When the characters return to town carrying the head of the monster they've slain, their quest-giver might grant them an audience with the {@book Tal'Dorei Council|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council}, give them special use of the {@book Traverse Junction|TDCSR|3|4. Traverse Junction} or some other magical marvel of the {@book Alabaster Lyceum|TDCSR|3|5. Alabaster Lyceum}, or bestow any number of other immaterial rewards.": "记住，宝藏不一定是黄金或魔法物品，也不一定要在地牢中找到。当角色们带着他们杀死的怪物的头颅回到城镇时，他们的任务给予者可能会让他们与{@book Tal'Dorei Council|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council}见面，赐予他们对{@book Traverse Junction|TDCSR|3|4. Traverse Junction}的特殊使用权，或者赐予其他魔法奇迹，或者给予其他任何一种无形的奖励。",
	"Don't worry if your plans go awry—they will. No RPG session ever goes totally as planned. The most important skill for any GM is the ability to improvise, because you can never predict everything your players will do. Make your plans loose and variable, and be willing to have fun and change course. Your players are surprised by every challenge you throw at them—so give yourself a chance for the same experience! It can be fun to be surprised, especially when you're the GM who supposedly holds all the important story cards.": "不要担心如果你的计划出了差错—它们总会出错。没有一场RPG游戏会完全按计划进行。对于任何GM来说，最重要的技能是即兴表演，因为你永远无法预测玩家们会做什么。让你的计划灵活多变，愿意享受并改变方向。你的玩家们会对你提出的每一个挑战感到惊讶—所以给自己一个同样的体验机会！被惊讶是很有趣的，尤其是当你是那个据说掌握所有重要故事牌的GM时。",
	"This section presents magic items for use in your Tal'Dorei campaign, including specific items used by {@book the Ashari|TDCSR|2|The Ashari} people of Exandria, and the legendary {@book Vestiges of Divergence|TDCSR|5|Vestiges of Divergence}.": "这一部分介绍了在你的塔尔多瑞（Tal'Dorei）战役中使用的魔法物品，包括艾克桑德里亚（Exandria）人民使用的特定物品，以及传奇{@book Vestiges of Divergence|TDCSR|5|Vestiges of Divergence}。",
	"Tal'Dorei is a land awash with magic. Numerous magical organizations, both stately and shadowy, create enchanted items to aid their members in mysterious quests.

Gilmore's Glorious Goods}在{@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}，公开出售魔法物品，只要有足够的金币支付他们奢侈（有些人可能会说是过高）的费用。",
	"GMs can use the magic items in this section—some of which have appeared in {@i Critical Role} before; some of which are all new—as treasure to reward the characters during their adventures. Unless otherwise stated, these items abide by the magic item rules laid down in the fifth edition core rules.": "GM们可以在本节中使用魔法物品——其中一些在{@i Critical Role}中出现过；一些是全新的——作为奖励角色在冒险中获得的宝藏。除非另有说明，这些物品遵循第五版核心规则中制定的魔法物品规则。",
	"{@book The Ashari|TDCSR|2|The Ashari} people have long used their connection and attunement to elemental power to create unique magic items, helping them in their quest to further understand and control the elements. These items are kept secret by their creators and are rarely given to people not of {@book the Ashari|TDCSR|2|The Ashari}. As such, they can be acquired only as a gift from an Ashari for rendering their people a great service, from the body of a dead Ashari explorer, or for an exorbitant price from someone who has acquired the item through dubious means.": "{@book The Ashari|TDCSR|2|The Ashari} 人长期以来利用他们与元素力量的联系和调谐，创造出独特的魔法物品，帮助他们在探索和控制元素方面更进一步。这些物品被它们的创造者保密，很少赠送给非{@book the Ashari|TDCSR|2|The Ashari}的人。因此，它们只能通过三种方式获得：作为阿夏瑞人为其族人提供巨大服务的回报、从一名已故的阿夏瑞探险者的遗体中获得，或者以极高的价格从通过可疑手段获得该物品的人那里购买。",
	"At the GM's discretion, the unique nature of these items might mean that a character not of {@book the Ashari|TDCSR|2|The Ashari} and unfamiliar with elemental magic can't automatically attune to them. Such characters can attune to one of the tools of {@book the Ashari|TDCSR|2|The Ashari} with 24 hours worth of special training from an Ashari familiar with the item's use.": "在{@book the Ashari|TDCSR|2|The Ashari}的GM酌情下，这些物品的独特属性可能意味着不懂元素魔法的角色不能自动调谐它们。这样的角色可以在24小时内接受{@book the Ashari|TDCSR|2|The Ashari}的工具中一种的特殊训练，由一位熟悉该物品使用方法的阿夏里人进行指导。",
	"During the wars of the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}, destruction rained across the world. Fragmented chronicles of this time recount battles between gods that leveled mountains and sank whole civilizations beneath the waves. Chosen heroes rose up to accept weapons, armor, and other magic items blessed by their patron gods to staunch the inexorable tide of death. Powerful archmages wove the overflowing arcane powers of the war into legendary magic items that could both thwart death and mete it out in equal measure.": "在{@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}战争期间，毁灭席卷全球。这段时间的碎片化编年史记载了神祗之间的战斗，这些战斗摧毁了山脉，将整个文明淹没在海浪之下。被选中的英雄们崛起，接受了由他们的主保神祗祝福的武器、盔甲和其他魔法物品，以阻止不可避免的死亡潮流。强大的大法师们将战争中涌动的奥术力量编织成传奇魔法物品，既能抵御死亡，又能同等程度地施加死亡。",
	"The Vestiges of Divergence are unique even among legendary magic items, for each one touches the defiant soul of its wielder and grows in power alongside them. The base state of a Vestige of Divergence is its dormant state, which the item returns to if sealed away or otherwise kept from being attuned by a worthy individual for a long period of time. A dormant state still imbues a modicum of power to an attuned wielder. But with time, perseverance, and personal growth, the Vestige of Divergence can regain access to some of its lost power in its awakened state. Eventually, if its bearer overcomes personal hardship and transforms their own soul, a Vestige of Divergence reaches its full potential in its exalted state. This shows the true power of the item, as it was when first utilized in the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity} against gods armed for war.": "分歧遗迹在传奇魔法物品中独树一帜，每一件都触及持有者的反抗灵魂，并随着他们的成长而增长力量。分歧遗迹的基本状态是它的休眠状态，如果被封印或者长时间未被配戴者调谐，物品将返回这个状态。即便处于休眠状态，分歧遗迹仍会赋予配戴者一些微弱的力量。但随着时间、毅力和个人成长，分歧遗迹可以在觉醒状态下重新获得部分失去的力量。最终，如果持有者克服个人困难并改变自己的灵魂，分歧遗迹将在其显赫状态下达到完全潜力。这展示了物品的真正力量，就像它在{@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}中首次被用于对抗准备战争的神明时一样。",
	"The point at which a character finds a Vestige of Divergence, as well as the point at which that item starts to unlock its full power, is entirely in the hands of the Game Master—though it is a topic that players and GMs can discuss and mutually scheme over between game sessions. The acquisition of such an item—or the discovery of its true identity—has the potential to be a scene of momentous narrative weight. Those who bear a Vestige of Divergence are respected and feared by those who understand these items' true power. But such an honor can also paint a target on the bearer's back, for many covet such power, and would do anything to obtain it.": "角色发现分歧遗迹(Vestige of Divergence)的时机，以及该物品开始解锁其全部力量的时机，完全掌握在主持人手中——尽管这是玩家和主持人可以在游戏间讨论和共同策划的话题。获得这样一件物品，或者发现其真正身份，都有可能成为一个具有重大叙事意义的场景。拥有分歧遗迹的人受到那些了解这些物品真正力量的人的尊敬和恐惧。但这样的荣誉也可能给持有者带来麻烦，因为许多人渴望这种力量，愿意不择手段地获取它。",
	"Many of the Vestiges of Divergence detailed in this section can currently be found in Tal'Dorei, while others are scattered elsewhere throughout Exandria. Some of these relics remain lost to time, waiting for someone to find them among the dust and rubble. Others might be in use by powerful heroes ready to pass the item's power onto a worthy successor who fights for the proper cause. Still others might be in the hands of twisted souls using them to terrorize the weak and defenseless. The Vestiges of Divergence are both magic items and narrative devices, and it's the GM's choice as to where any one of them might be found or earned.": "这一部分详细介绍了分歧遗物，许多分歧遗物目前可以在塔尔多瑞（Tal'Dorei）找到，而其他一些则散落在整个艾克桑德里亚（Exandria）其他地方。一些遗物仍然隐匿在时光之中，等待有人在尘土和瓦砾中找到它们。另一些可能正在被强大的英雄使用，准备将物品的力量传递给一个为正义事业而战的配得上的继承者。还有一些可能被扭曲的灵魂所掌控，利用它们来恐吓弱者和无助者。分歧遗物既是魔法物品，也是叙事工具，GM可以自行决定它们中的任何一个可能被发现或获得的地点。",
	"The conditions by which a {@book Vestige of Divergence|TDCSR|5|Vestiges of Divergence} progresses to its next level of power can vary, and often revolve around the nature of the specific item and its magic. An attuned bearer of a {@book Vestige of Divergence|TDCSR|5|Vestiges of Divergence} must often symbolically progress to a new state of self-discovery or accomplishment. Alternatively, a {@book Vestige of Divergence|TDCSR|5|Vestiges of Divergence} might bequeath new power to a character in a state of extreme personal duress or desperation.": "一个{@book Vestige of Divergence|TDCSR|5|Vestiges of Divergence}进阶到下一个强大等级的条件可能各不相同，通常围绕着特定物品及其魔法的本质。一个{@book Vestige of Divergence|TDCSR|5|Vestiges of Divergence}的被灵感的持有者通常必须象征性地进入一个新的自我发现或成就状态。另外，一个{@book Vestige of Divergence|TDCSR|5|Vestiges of Divergence}可能会在个人极度困厄或绝望状态下赋予角色新的力量。",
	"Such triggering moments are entirely up to the Game Master to identify and unveil, and as such, will likely manifest in unexpected ways.

	"A character is mercilessly defeated by a long-hated foe, and in the face of such defeat, they feel a deep, dormant strength grow from within.": "一个角色被长期仇恨的敌人无情地打败，面对这样的失败，他们感到内心涌起了一股深沉而沉睡已久的力量。",
	"A character loses a close ally in battle, and the anguish and fury stirs the power within their {@book Vestige of Divergence|TDCSR|5|Vestiges of Divergence}.": "一个角色在战斗中失去了一位亲密盟友，内心的痛苦和愤怒激发了他们{@book Vestige of Divergence|TDCSR|5|Vestiges of Divergence}内的力量。",
	"A character discovers a facet of their destiny that calls their actions toward a dangerous cause—and against their own fear, they accept their fate and responsibility.": "一个角色发现了自己命运的一个方面，这驱使他们行动起来支持一个危险的事业——尽管他们内心充满恐惧，但他们还是接受了自己的命运和责任。",

	"A character known for restraint gives in to the amoral violence that the relic they bear was dedicated to.": "一个以克制著称的角色屈服于其所携带的遗物所奉献的不道德暴力。",
	"If you want to keep the Vestiges \"balanced,\" in addition to being narratively significant, then characters may find a dormant Vestige before 11th level—perhaps unaware that it's even a Vestige! That dormant Vestige is awakened somewhere between 11th and 17th level, and is exalted at any time after that. Even using these level ranges as a rule of thumb, you shouldn't rely too heavily on those mechanical benchmarks. A {@book Vestige of Divergence's|TDCSR|5|Vestiges of Divergence} advancement is triggered by character development, not simply by leveling up.": "如果你想保持遗物（Vestiges）的“平衡”，除了在叙事上具有重要意义之外，角色可能会在11级之前发现一个休眠的遗物——也许甚至不知道它是一个遗物！这个休眠的遗物会在11级至17级之间被唤醒，并且在此之后的任何时间都可以被提升。即使使用这些级别范围作为经验法则，你也不应该过分依赖这些机械标准。一个{@book Vestige of Divergence's|TDCSR|5|Vestiges of Divergence}的进展是由角色发展而触发的，而不仅仅是通过升级来实现。",
	"The {@book Vestiges of Divergence|TDCSR|5|Vestiges of Divergence} were all created by humanoids or gifted by the gods to their humanoid champions. As such, all of these legendary magic items are sized to suit Medium creatures. However, the mighty magic that thrums within each item allows it to grow or shrink in size to suit the creature attuned to it.": "这些{@book Vestiges of Divergence|TDCSR|5|Vestiges of Divergence}都是由人形生物创造的，或者是神明赐予他们的人形冠军。因此，所有这些传奇魔法物品的尺寸都适合中等生物。然而，每件物品内蕴藏的强大魔法能量使其能够根据与其相连的生物的尺寸而增长或缩小。",
	"The game statistics of a {@book Vestige of Divergence|TDCSR|5|Vestiges of Divergence} don't change when it resizes unless the item is a weapon. When a Large or larger creature makes an attack with such a weapon, the weapon deals one additional damage die for each size category its wielder is larger than Medium. For example, if {@item Fenthras|TDCSR} is used by a Large fey, attacks made using the longbow deal {@damage 2d8} piercing damage. If {@item Pyremaul|TDCSR} is used by a Huge giant, attacks made using the maul deal {@damage 4d6} bludgeoning damage.": "当一个{@book Vestige of Divergence|TDCSR|5|Vestiges of Divergence}改变大小时，其游戏属性不会改变，除非该物品是武器。当一个大型或更大的生物使用这样的武器进行攻击时，武器会额外造成一个伤害骰，每个大小类别比中型更大的武器使用者增加一个伤害骰。例如，如果{@item Fenthras|TDCSR}被一个大型精灵使用，使用长弓进行攻击造成{@damage 2d8}穿刺伤害。如果{@item Pyremaul|TDCSR}被一个巨大的巨人使用，使用大槌进行攻击造成{@damage 4d6}的砸伤伤害。",
	"When the god-war spread across Exandria, no creature was safe, no matter how small and insignificant, no matter how mighty and powerful.

	"The answer—perhaps ironically, given how the arcane arts and a hunger for godhood brought about the Calamity—lay in magic of both arcane and divine provenance. Not paltry charms or trinkets, but the kind of magic that suffuses the ley lines of this world and plucks at the very fabric of reality. True, a mortal army may be naught but a cloud of gnats to the gods, but a singular hero—or villain—wielding an artifact imbued with magic beyond reckoning...such a champion could bring their strength and cunning to bear amidst the devastation of the god-war.": "答案——或许具有讽刺意味的是，考虑到奥术和对神力的渴望如何引发了灾难——在奥术和神圣起源的魔法中。不是微不足道的魔法符咒或小玩意，而是那种充斥着这个世界的地脉并拨动着现实本质的魔法。没错，一个凡人军队对神明来说或许只是一群蚊子，但一个拥有超乎计量的魔法的神器的英雄——或恶棍——...这样的英雄可以在神战的毁灭中发挥他们的力量和智慧。",

Moreover, the full potential of these items could only used by those with souls worthy of wielding such legendary power....": "因此，诸神甚至最伟大的凡人法师铸造了前所未见的力量遗物，我认为自那时以来也从未见过。此外，这些物品的全部潜力只能被那些拥有配得上运用如此传奇力量的灵魂的人使用...",

Highborn giants in their isolated and idyllic cities usually live full lives and die of old age more than any other cause—though highborn politics can be cutthroat, and assassination has ended the long life of many a giant over the centuries.": "巨人的自然寿命大约为300年，尽管艰苦劳作的生活意味着低贱的巨人很少活过200年。在他们与世隔绝、宁静祥和的城市中，高贵的巨人通常能活满一生，而死于老年的原因要比其他任何原因多——尽管高贵的政治斗争可能异常激烈，暗杀在几个世纪里结束了许多巨人的长寿生命。",
	"{@creature ogre|MM|Ogres}, {@creature cyclops|MM|cyclopes}, and {@creature hill giant|MM|hill giants} occupy the lowest rungs of giant society. The highborn keep them at arm's length, using them as a sort of barrier between humanoid and giant civilizations. The lowborn band together, forming tight-knit social groups that must fight and forage to survive. {@creature cyclops|MM|Cyclopes} typically rule lowborn settlements, and some {@creature hill giant} warriors ritualistically tear out one eye to emulate their rulers. Zealous {@creature hill giant} worshipers of the {@deity The Ruiner|Exandria|TDCSR|Ruiner} sometimes do the same, with that god granting them power to survive in exchange for ever-increasing sacrifices.": "{@creature ogre|MM|Ogres}, {@creature cyclops|MM|cyclopes}, and {@creature hill giant|MM|hill giants}占据了巨人社会的最底层。贵族们保持着与他们的距离，将他们作为一种隔离人类和巨人文明的屏障。贱民们团结在一起，形成紧密的社会团体，必须战斗和觅食才能生存。{@creature cyclops|MM|Cyclopes}通常统治着贱民定居点，而一些{@creature hill giant}战士会仪式性地剜出一只眼睛来效仿他们的统治者。狂热的{@creature hill giant}信徒有时也会这样做，这位神灵会赐予他们力量以换取越来越多的牺牲。",
	"{@creature cyclops|MM|Cyclopes}, ogres, and {@creature hill giant|MM|hill giants} who turn to corrupting magic to help them survive lives of hunger and exile sometimes tumble into a cycle of cruelty and devotion to evil powers from which there is no escape.

Such corrupted giants typically live selfishly, and try to transform lowborn enclaves into their own personal armies of conquest.": "{@creature cyclops|MM|Cyclopes}、食人魔和{@creature hill giant|MM|hill giants}为了在饥饿和流放的生活中求生，有时会陷入一种残酷和对邪恶力量的奉献的循环，无法摆脱。他们的心智和身体被扭曲得无法辨认，变成{@creature troll|MM|trolls}或{@creature oni}。这些巨人获得了巨大的力量，但失去了任何同情心。这些被腐化的巨人通常过着自私的生活，并试图将平民聚居区变成他们自己的征服军。",

These giants are considered one people divided into different cultures, having adopted different magics, fighting styles, and codes of ethics and law.

The cloud giants are ruled by two wedded monarchs, currently a City-King in charge of domestic affairs, and a War-King tasked with the defense of Jovatthon against dragons and other highborn giants.

	"These subterranean giants dwell in the same tunnels as {@creature drow} and {@creature duergar}, typically beneath volcanically active mountain ranges whose natural magma fuels their forges.

	"The {@creature frost giant|MM|frost giants} of Jotunborg are renowned for their ability to tame the fearsome beasts of the {@book Neverfields|TDCSR|3|The Neverfields}—including the white dragons that haunt the skies of that land. This skill and their knack for surviving in an inhospitable realm has made the giants of Jotunborg a pious people, and most pray to the {@deity The Wildmother|Exandria|TDCSR|Wildmother} for safety before crossing the ice fields.

Some mountain climbers fortunate enough to see such a sight become convinced that they have gazed upon the {@deity The Dawnfather|Exandria|TDCSR|Dawnfather} himself. {@creature stone giant|MM|Stone giants} are happy to encourage such rumors, for it makes their existence seem more like myth than fact. These reclusive highborn giantkin live in fortresses carved from the peaks of mountains.

But unlike the lowborn giantkin who have grown strong and resilient out of struggle, {@creature stone giant|MM|stone giants} see physical power as an abstract virtue, best used in sporting events. A quadrennial tournament of prowess called the Sky Queen's Favor is held in coliseums atop Skyanchor, and highborn giants from across Tal'Dorei gather there to compete in tests of strength, agility, and endurance. Even the {@creature stone giant|MM|stone giants'} humanoid kin, the half-giant {@book goliaths|TDCSR|4|Half-Giants}, are occasionally present at the Sky Queen's Favor.": "{@creature Stone giant}文化将完美的外貌视为所有美德中最伟大的，{@creature stone giant|MM|stone giants}痴迷于外貌和力量壮举。但与那些通过挣扎变得强壮和坚韧的平民巨人不同，{@creature stone giant|MM|stone giants}将体力视为一种抽象美德，最好在体育赛事中展现。每四年举行一次名为“天后之宠”的实力比拼锦标赛在天锚之巅的角斗场举行，来自整个塔尔多雷的高贵巨人聚集在那里，参加力量、敏捷和耐力测试。甚至那些{@creature stone giant|MM|stone giants'}人形近亲，半巨人{@book goliaths|TDCSR|4|Half-Giants}，有时也会出现在“天后之宠”比赛中。",
	"The most mysterious of all the highborn, the {@creature storm giant|MM|storm giants} are rarely seen even by other giantkin.

	"Two of the seven thrones of the council have remained empty for generations.

		"In a time long past, an archmage of unparalleled power known as {@deity The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR} attempted to ascend to godhood by conducting the Ritual of Seeding from high atop the citadel of Thar Ampala within the Plane of Shadow. {@deity The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR} surrounded himself with a cult of fanatical mages and empowered murderers to protect him during his apotheosis. Despite these protections, he failed. His cult, however, survived, and helped him return to power centuries later, after the defeat of the {@book Chroma Conclave|TDCSR|1|The Chroma Conclave}. He succeeded in his bid for godhood, but was kept from utterly dominating the Material Plane at the last second by Vox Machina, who banished him beyond the Divine Gate, where he was shackled by all the same limitations as the other gods.": "在很久以前，一位无与伦比的大法师，被称为{@deity The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR}，试图通过在暗影位面的萨尔安帕拉城堡顶上进行种子仪式来晋升为神。{@deity The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR}自己周围聚集了一群狂热的法师和强大的杀手来保护他在神格化过程中。尽管有这些保护，他最终失败了。然而，他的教派幸存下来，并在几个世纪后，帮助他重返权力，击败{@book Chroma Conclave|TDCSR|1|The Chroma Conclave}后，他成功地成为了神。但就在最后一刻，他被“(%Vox Machina)”阻止了完全统治物质位面，他被放逐到神圣之门之外，并受到了与其他神一样的限制。",
	"The artistic and spiritual center of {@book Syngorn|TDCSR|3|Syngorn} is a winding labyrinth of living trees and stones. {@book Elves|TDCSR|4|elves} who seek a day-long (or days-long) journey of meditation may wander the Reverie Walks, entering a trance-like state as they do so. Those who seek true enlightenment may dedicate years of their near-immortal lives to wandering the ever-shifting labyrinth, finding peace in isolation or in search of the Stone of the {@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart} in the labyrinth's center. An elven monk named Lyssev Sorveline has walked the labyrinth for five hundred years, seeking answers to questions even the gods do not know. Some {@book elves|TDCSR|4|elves} leave gifts of food for the Wanderer within the labyrinth, allowing them to continue their eternal meditation in peace.": "{@book Syngorn|TDCSR|3|Syngorn}的艺术和精神中心是一片蜿蜒的活树和石头迷宫。寻求进行一整天（或数天）冥想之旅的人可以漫步在幻境漫步中，进入类似出神的状态。那些寻求真正启迪的人可能会将他们接近不朽的生命奉献给漫步在不断变化的迷宫中，他们在孤独中找到平静，或者寻找迷宫中心的{@deity The Arch Heart|Exandria|TDCSR|Arch Heart}之石。一位名为莱瑟夫·索维林（Lyssev Sorveline）的精灵僧侣已经在迷宫中行走了五百年，寻找连神明也不知道的问题的答案。一些{@book elves|TDCSR|4|elves}会在迷宫内留下食物作为对漫步者的礼物，让他们能够在平静中继续他们永恒的冥想。",
	"The Hands of Ord, the city's guards, also protect nearby villages and townships within the desert, but they can only reach so far. Further south, beyond the reach of {@book Ank'Harel|TDCSR|3|Marquet} and the Hands of Ord, the sands give way to scrubland and marshes tangled with the volatile mountains surrounding the smoking Suuthan Volcano and the dangerous clans that worship it. Westward, beyond the arid desert, lies a vibrant landscape of verdant jungles, craggy mountains, and magical mysteries that the people of {@book Marquet|TDCSR|3|Marquet} have spent eons unraveling. Within the jungles of {@book Marquet|TDCSR|3|Marquet} are dozens of cultures, some nomadic, some seafaring, and some with great cities of their own. One such city, founded by orcish survivors of the {@deity The Ruiner|Exandria|TDCSR|Ruiner's} wrath during the {@book Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}, is known across Exandria for its mathematically immaculate architecture.
