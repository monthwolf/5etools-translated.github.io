	"Activating some magic items requires a user to do something in particular, such as holding the item and uttering a command word, reading the item if it is a scroll, or drinking it if it is a potion. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use one or more of the following rules related to their activation.": "激活一些魔法物品需要使用者做一些特别的事情，比如拿着物品并说出一个命令词，如果是卷轴，则阅读该物品，如果是药水，则饮用该物品。每个物品类别或单个物品的描述都详细说明了物品如何被激活。某些物品使用了一个或多个与它们的激活有关的规则。",
	"A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken audibly for the item to operate. A magic item that requires the user to speak a command word can't be activated in the area of any effect that prevents sound, such as the area created by the silence spell.": "命令词是一个必须以声音说出的单词或短语，以便物品能够运作。一个需要使用者说出命令词的魔法物品不能在任何阻止声音的效果区域内被激活，比如沉默咒语所创造的区域。",
	"Some items are used up when they are activated. A potion or elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic and no longer functions.": "有些物品在被激活后会被用掉。药水或灵药必须吞下，或将油涂在身上。卷轴上的文字在被阅读后会消失。消耗品一旦使用，就会失去其魔力，不再起作用。",
	"Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item, often by expending charges from it. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell and caster level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and requires no components unless the item's description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.": "一些魔法物品允许使用者从该物品中施放法术，通常是通过消耗它的费用。该法术以最低的法术和施法者等级施放，不消耗使用者的任何法术槽，并且不需要任何组件，除非该物品的描述另有说明。该法术使用其正常的施法时间、范围和持续时间，如果该法术需要集中注意力，则该物品的使用者必须集中注意力。某些物品对这些规则做了例外处理，改变了施法时间、持续时间或法术的其他部分。",
	"Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of the spell and confer the spell's effects. Such an item still uses the spell's duration unless the item's description says otherwise.": "许多物品，例如药水，绕过了施法，并赋予了法术的效果。这样的物品仍然使用法术的持续时间，除非该物品的描述另有说明。",
	"A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability—perhaps you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature—your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply.": "一个魔法物品，比如某些法杖，可能需要你在用该物品施法时使用你自己的施法能力。如果你有一个以上的法术能力，你可以选择哪一个来使用该物品。如果你没有法术能力--也许你是一个拥有使用魔法装置功能的流氓--你的法术能力修改器对该物品来说是+0，而你的熟练度加成则适用。",
	"Some magic items have charges that you expend to activate its properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on the item, or when a creature attunes to the item. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to that item learns how many charges it regained.": "有些魔法物品有费用，你需要花费费用来激活它的属性。当对物品施展识别法术时，或者当一个生物与物品相适应时，物品剩余的电荷数会被显示。此外，当一个物品重新获得电荷时，与该物品相适应的生物会了解它重新获得了多少电荷。",
	"The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.": "战斗中最常见的动作是攻击动作，无论你是挥舞着剑，用弓射箭，还是用拳头斗殴。",
	"Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.": "某些功能，如战士的额外攻击功能，允许你用这个动作进行一次以上的攻击。",
	"When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.": "当你采取冲刺行动时，你在当前回合获得额外的移动。增加的幅度等于你的速度，在应用了任何修饰因素之后。例如，如果你的速度是30英尺，你可以在你的回合中移动到60英尺。",
	"Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.": "对你的速度的任何增加或减少都会以相同的数量改变这种额外的移动。例如，如果你的速度从30英尺降低到15英尺，那么如果你冲刺的话，本回合你最多可以移动30英尺。",
	"The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.": "如果目标用两只或更多的手拿着该物品，则攻击者在其攻击卷中处于劣势。如果目标比攻击者大，它的能力检查就有优势，如果它小，就有劣势。",
	"If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.": "如果你采取脱离行动，你的行动在回合的剩余时间内不会引起机会攻击。",
	"When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in the appendix) or if your speed drops to 0.": "当你采取躲避动作时，你完全专注于躲避攻击。在你下一回合开始之前，如果你能看到攻击者，任何针对你的攻击卷都是不利的，而你做灵巧救赎则是有利的。如果你丧失了能力（如附录中所解释的）或者你的速度下降到0，你就会失去这个好处。",
	"If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).": "如果一个法术必须用集中力来维持，这个事实就会出现在它的持续时间条目中，并且法术规定了你可以集中精力在它身上多长时间。你可以在任何时候结束专注（不需要行动）。",
	"As an action, a character can use a healing surge and spend up to half his or her Hit Dice. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.": "作为一个行动，一个角色可以使用一个治疗突增，并花费他或她的一半命中率。以这种方式花掉的每一个命中率骰子，玩家都会掷骰子并加上角色的体质修正值。该角色恢复的命中率与总数相等。玩家可以决定在每次掷骰子后再花一个额外的命中率。",
	"A character who uses a healing surge can't do so again until he or she finishes a short or long rest. Under this optional rule, a character regains all spent Hit Dice at the end of a long rest. With a short rest, a character regains Hit Dice equal to his or her level divided by four (minimum of one dice).": "一个使用了治疗激增的角色在完成短期或长期休息之前不能再这样做。在这个可选的规则下，一个角色在长时间休息结束后会恢复所有已消耗的生命值。短暂休息时，角色恢复的命中率等于他或她的等级除以四（最少一个骰子）。",
	"You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.": "你可以在完成一项任务时向另一个生物提供帮助。当你采取帮助行动时，你所帮助的生物在它为执行你所帮助的任务而进行的下一次能力检查中获得优势，只要它在你下一回合开始前进行检查。",
	"Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.": "或者，你可以帮助一个友好的生物攻击你周围5英尺内的生物。你进行佯攻，分散目标的注意力，或者以其他方式组队，使你的盟友的攻击更加有效。如果你的盟友在你的下一个回合之前攻击目标，那么第一次攻击卷轴是以优势进行的。",
	"Sometimes a character wants to identify a spell that someone else is casting or that was already cast. To do so, a character can use their reaction to identify a spell as it's being cast, or they can use an action on their turn to identify a spell by its effect after it is cast.": "有时，一个角色想识别别人正在施放的或已经施放的法术。要做到这一点，角色可以使用他们的反应来识别正在施放的咒语，或者他们可以在他们的回合中使用行动来识别施放后的咒语效果。",
	"This option makes it easier for melee combatants to harry each other with opportunity attacks.": "这个选项使近战战斗人员更容易用机会攻击来骚扰对方。",
	"In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so provokes an opportunity attack.": "在战斗中，每个人都在不断观察敌人是否会放松警惕。你很少能漫不经心地从你的敌人身边走过而不使自己处于危险之中；这样做会引起机会攻击。",
	"You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack interrupts the provoking creature's movement, occurring right before the creature leaves your reach.": "当一个你能看到的敌对生物移动到你的范围之外时，你可以进行一次机会攻击。为了进行机会攻击，你用你的反应对挑衅的生物进行一次近战攻击。攻击会打断挑衅生物的移动，在该生物离开你的范围之前发生。",
	"Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.": "你的回合可以包括各种既不需要你的行动也不需要你的移动的装饰。",
	"You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.": "在轮到你的时候，你可以通过简短的话语和手势，以你能做到的方式进行交流。",
	"You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.": "你也可以在你的动作或行动中与环境中的一个物体或特征自由互动。例如，你可以在你的行动中打开一扇门，因为你正大步走向一个敌人，或者你可以拔出你的武器，作为你用来攻击的同一行动的一部分。",
	"If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.": "如果你想与第二个物体互动，你需要使用你的行动。一些魔法物品和其他特殊物品总是需要行动才能使用，这在它们的描述中有所说明。",

	"Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.": "有时你想在敌人面前抢占先机，或者在你行动之前等待一个特殊情况。要做到这一点，你可以在你的回合中采取准备行动，这可以让你在下一回合开始前用你的反应行动。",
	"First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include \"If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it,\" and \"If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.\"": "首先，你决定什么可感知的情况会触发你的反应。然后，你选择你将采取的行动来回应这个触发，或者你选择以你的速度来回应它。例子包括 \"如果邪教徒踩到活板门，我就拉动打开活板的杠杆\"，以及 \"如果小妖精走到我旁边，我就走开\"。",
	"When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.": "当触发发生时，你可以在触发结束后立即做出反应，或者忽略触发。记住，你每轮只能做出一个反应。",
	"You have until the start of your next turn to use a readied action.": "你可以在下一回合开始前使用一个准备好的行动。",

	"You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.": "你通常在做其他事情的时候与一个物体互动，例如当你拔出一把剑作为攻击的一部分。当一个物体的使用需要你的行动时，你就采取使用一个物体的行动。当你想在你的回合中与一个以上的物体互动时，这个动作也很有用。",
	"A creature that is naturally sleeping, as opposed to being in a magically or chemically induced sleep, wakes up if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake. A sudden loud noise—such as yelling, thunder, or a ringing bell—also awakens someone that is sleeping naturally.": "一个自然睡眠的生物，而不是处于魔法或化学诱导的睡眠中，如果它受到任何伤害，或者如果其他人使用动作摇晃或拍打该生物，就会醒来。突如其来的巨响--比如大喊大叫、打雷或响铃--也会唤醒自然睡眠的人。",
	"If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn't a function of the {@action Use an Object} action, so a feature such as the rogue's {@subclassFeature Fast Hands|Rogue||Thief||3} can't be used to activate the item.": "如果一个物品需要一个动作来激活，那个动作不是{@action Use an Object}动作的一部分，因此像流氓的{@subclassFeature Fast Hands|Rogue||Thief||3}这样的特性不能用来激活该物品。",

	"Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. See {@book chapter 10|phb|10|casting a spell} for the rules on spellcasting.": "像巫师和牧师这样的施法者，以及许多怪物，都可以使用法术，并在战斗中将其发挥到极致。每个法术都有施法时间，指定了施法者是否必须使用一个动作、一个反应、几分钟，甚至几个小时来施放法术。因此，施放法术并不一定是一个动作。大多数法术的施法时间为1个动作，因此施法者通常会在战斗中使用他或她的动作来施放这样的法术。请参阅{@book chapter 10|phb|10|casting a spell}了解有关施法的规则。",
	"If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it can do so by {@action grapple||grappling}. A small or Medium creature has little chance of making a successful grapple against a Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic has granted the grappler supernatural might.": "如果一个生物想要跳到另一个生物身上，它可以通过{@action grapple||grappling}这样做。然而，一个小型或中型生物几乎没有机会成功地对抗巨大或庞大生物的擒抱，除非魔法赋予擒抱者超自然的力量。",
	"As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check contested by the target's Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check.

	"The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. The larger creature's ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's location, and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action—knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it—by making a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check contested by the smaller creature's Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.": "较小的生物可以在较大生物的空间内移动，将空间视为{@quickref difficult terrain||3}。较大生物攻击较小生物的能力取决于较小生物的位置，由你自行决定。较大生物可以作为一个动作将较小生物移开——撞击它、将它刮到墙上，或者抓住并扔掉它——通过进行一次由较大生物的力量({@skill Athletics})检定对抗较小生物的力量({@skill Athletics})或敏捷({@skill Acrobatics})检定。较小生物选择使用哪种属性。",

	"If the character perceived the casting, the spell's effect, or both, the character can make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check with the reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level. If the spell is cast as a class spell and the character is a member of that class, the check is made with advantage. For example, if the spellcaster casts a spell as a cleric, another cleric has advantage on the check to identify the spell. Some spells aren't associated with any class when they're cast, such as when a monster uses its Innate Spellcasting trait.": "如果角色察觉到了施法过程、法术效果，或两者皆有，角色可以使用一次反应或行动进行一个智力检定（{@skill Arcana}）。检定 DC 为 15 加上法术等级。如果法术是作为职业法术施放的，而角色也是该职业的成员，则可以获得优势进行检定。例如，如果施法者以牧师的身份施放法术，另一位牧师在辨识该法术时可以获得优势。有些法术在施放时不与任何职业相关，比如怪物使用其固有施法特性时。",
	"Your character can do things not covered by the actions in this chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating enemies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or calling for a parley with a foe.

	"When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also mark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn, any opportunity attack it makes against the marked target has advantage.

	"When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature's space, the mover can try to force its way through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check contested by the hostile creature's Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check.

	"When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires {@status concentration} (explained in {@book chapter 10|phb|10|concentration}). If your {@status concentration} is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are {@status concentration||concentrating} on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release magic missile with your reaction, your {@status concentration} might be broken.": "当你准备一个法术时，你会像平常一样施放它，但保留它的能量，直到触发条件发生时才释放。要准备一个法术，它的施法时间必须是1个行动，并且保持法术的魔法需要{@status concentration}（在{@book chapter 10|phb|10|concentration}中解释）。如果你的{@status concentration}被打断，法术会消散而不会生效。例如，如果你正在施放网法术并准备魔法飞弹，你的网法术会结束，如果在你用反应释放魔法飞弹之前受到伤害，你的{@status concentration}可能会被打断。",

	"The target of your shove must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. You make a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check contested by the target's Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is {@condition incapacitated}. If you succeed, you either knock the target {@condition prone} or push it 5 feet away from you.": "你推挤的目标必须比你大不超过一个体型，并且必须在你的攻击范围内。你进行一次力量检定，对抗目标的力量{@skill Athletics}或敏捷{@skill Acrobatics}检定（目标选择使用哪项属性）。如果目标是{@condition incapacitated}，你自动成功。如果你成功，你可以选择把目标{@condition prone}或者将其推开5英尺。",
	"With this option, a creature uses the special {@action shove} attack from the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB|9|Shoving a Creature} to force a target to the side, rather than away. The attacker has disadvantage on its Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check when it does so. If that check is successful, the attacker moves the target 5 feet to a different space within its reach.": "使用这个选项，生物使用来自{@book Player's Handbook|PHB|9|Shoving a Creature}的特殊{@action shove}攻击，将目标推到一侧，而不是远离。当这样做时，攻击者在进行力量检定时有劣势({@skill Athletics})。如果检定成功，攻击者将目标移动5英尺到其射程内的另一个空间。",
	"A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's space, ducking and weaving past the opponent.

If the tumbler wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.": "一只生物可以尝试在敌对生物的空间中翻滚，躲闪过对手。作为一个动作或者奖励动作，翻滚者进行一个由敏捷属性({@skill Acrobatics})检定，与敌对生物的敏捷属性({@skill Acrobatics})检定进行对抗。如果翻滚者赢得比赛，它可以在这个回合中穿过敌对生物的空间移动一次。",
	"When you take the {@action Attack} action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.": "当你执行{@action Attack}动作并用一只手持轻型近战武器进行攻击时，你可以使用一个额外动作来用另一只手持的轻型近战武器进行攻击。除非该修正值为负数，否则你不会在额外攻击的伤害中加上你的能力修正值。",
