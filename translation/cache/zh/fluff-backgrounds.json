{
	"You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.": "你一生都在为一个特定的神或万神殿服务。你充当神圣领域和凡人世界之间的中间人，执行神圣的仪式并提供祭品，以引导崇拜者进入神圣的世界。你不一定是教士--举行神圣仪式与引导神力是两回事。",
	"Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. The Gods of the Multiverse section contains a sample pantheon, from the Forgotten Realms setting. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.": "选择一个神、一个万神殿或其他准神的存在，并与你的管理员合作，详细说明你的宗教仪式的性质。多元宇宙的诸神部分包含了一个万神殿的样本，来自《被遗忘的领域》的设定。你是神庙里的一个小职员，从小就被培养来协助祭司进行神圣的仪式？或者你是一个大祭司，突然经历了一个以不同方式为你的神服务的召唤？也许你是任何既定神庙结构之外的一个小邪教的领袖，或者甚至是一个服务于你现在否认的邪恶主人的神秘团体。",
	"You have always been fascinated by other cultures, from the most ancient and primeval lost lands to the most modern civilizations. By studying other cultures' customs, philosophies, laws, rituals, religious beliefs, languages, and art, you have learned how tribes, empires, and all forms of society in between craft their own destinies and doom. This knowledge came to you not only through books and scrolls, but also through firsthand observation—by visiting far-flung settlements and exploring local histories and customs.": "你一直对其他文化很着迷，从最古老的原始失落之地到最现代的文明。通过研究其他文化的习俗、哲学、法律、仪式、宗教信仰、语言和艺术，你了解到部落、帝国和介于两者之间的所有社会形式是如何打造自己的命运和末日的。这些知识不仅是通过书本和卷轴获得的，也是通过第一手的观察--访问遥远的定居点，探索当地的历史和习俗。",
	"An archaeologist learns about the long-lost and fallen cultures of the past by studying their remains-their bones, their ruins, their surviving masterworks, and their tombs. Those who practice archaeology travel to the far corners of the world to root through crumbled cities and lost dungeons, digging in search of artifacts that might tell the stories of monarchs and high priests, wars and cataclysms.": "考古学家通过研究他们的遗骸--他们的骨头、他们的废墟、他们幸存的杰作和他们的坟墓，来了解过去久违的和没落的文化。那些从事考古工作的人前往世界的各个角落，在破碎的城市和失落的地牢中挖掘，寻找可能讲述君主和大祭司、战争和大灾难故事的文物。",
	"You strive to perfect yourself physically and in execution of everything you do. The thrill of competition lights fire in your blood, and the roar of the crowd drives you forward. Tales of your exploits precede you and might open doors or loosen tongues.": "你努力完善自己的身体和执行你所做的一切。竞争的快感在你的血液中点燃，人群的轰鸣声驱使你前进。你的事迹在你面前流传，可能会打开大门或让人松口气。",
	"Whether in one of the poleis, between them, or among the nonhuman peoples of Theros, physical contests and those who pursue them command respect bordering on reverence. Athletes arise from all walks of life and all cultures and quite often cross paths with one another.": "无论是在某个极地，还是在极地之间，或者在特洛斯的非人类民族中，体育竞赛和那些追求体育竞赛的人都得到了近乎崇敬的尊重。运动员们来自各行各业和各种文化，并且经常相互交错。",
	"Little is known about the Augen Trust, even within the court of the Dwendalian Empire. Only one person knows all the members of this elite network of imperial spies: its leader, Oliver Schreiber, a noble gnome with the ear of King Dwendal.": "人们对奥根信托基金知之甚少，即使在德文达尔帝国的宫廷内也是如此。只有一个人知道这个帝国间谍精英网络的所有成员：它的领导人奥利弗-施莱伯，一个拥有德文达尔国王耳朵的高贵的地精。",
	"If you were favored with membership in the Augen Trust, your entire life was laid bare before the secret spymaster at one point, and you were found to be a loyal servant of the empire with a particular set of skills. Betraying the Trust is high treason against the crown, and defectors are hunted down and quickly slain.": "如果你被青睐为奥根信托的成员，那么你的整个生活一度在秘密间谍大师面前暴露无遗，而且你被发现是帝国的忠实仆人，有一套特殊的技能。背叛信托是对王室的高度叛逆，叛逃者会被追捕并迅速被杀。",
	"Most defectors from the Augen Trust flee to the Biting North, beyond the reach of the empire. The Clovis Concord would extradite traitors in a heartbeat to maintain diplomatic relations with the empire, and fleeing to Xhorhas is tantamount to suicide in the present political climate.": "大多数奥根信托的叛逃者都逃到了帝国鞭长莫及的北方。克洛维斯协约会为了保持与帝国的外交关系，会立即引渡叛徒，而在目前的政治气候下，逃到Xhorhas无异于自杀。",
	"If you are a member of the Trust going on adventures, you are either a traitor who has somehow managed to keep your true identity secret from the greatest spies in the empire—or you are still on active duty. In the latter case, you can work with your DM to figure out why you are traveling with outside adventurers.": "如果你是正在进行冒险的托拉斯成员，那么你要么是一个叛徒，以某种方式对帝国最伟大的间谍保守了你的真实身份，要么你仍然在服役。在后一种情况下，你可以和你的DM一起工作，弄清楚为什么你要和外面的冒险者一起旅行。",
	"The brutes are at the gate, chaos is looming, and the only thing standing in the way of disaster is the foundation of law and order—as embodied in the Azorius Senate. You're a proud member of the Azorius guild, which both enacts and enforces the laws that make Ravnican society function smoothly and safely.": "畜生们在门口，混乱迫在眉睫，而唯一挡在灾难面前的是法律和秩序的基础--体现在Azorius元老院中。你是Azorius公会的骄傲成员，它制定和执行法律，使Ravnican社会顺利和安全地运作。",
	"It's said that every faith in the world has a believer in Baldur's Gate. Not only are most established faiths tolerated—even if some of them, including most of the openly evil faiths, are relegated to the Outer City's Twin Songs neighborhood—but new ones arrive constantly, carried by travelers and proselytizers from far-flung lands. A character with this background might aspire to greater things, not for themselves, but for their faith.": "据说世界上的每一种信仰在博德之门都有一个信徒。不仅大多数成熟的信仰被容忍--即使其中一些，包括大多数公开的邪恶信仰，被归入外城的双子星社区--而且新的信仰不断到来，由来自远方的旅行者和传教士携带。有这种背景的人物可能会渴望做更大的事情，不是为了自己，而是为了他们的信仰。",
	"Everybody's always trying to get a leg up on somebody in Baldur's Gate. One group's con artist might be another's revolutionary. Or maybe you're just in it for yourself. In any case, characters with this background have a plan to hit the big time; all they need is audacity and a little time.": "在《博德之门》中，每个人都想在别人身上抢占先机。一个团体的骗子可能是另一个团体的革命者。也可能你只是为了自己。在任何情况下，具有这种背景的人物都有一个计划，可以大展拳脚；他们所需要的只是胆量和一点时间。",
	"No career criminal in Baldur's Gate operates without being aware of the Guild. Some studiously keep a low profile, carrying just the occasional smuggled load in with legitimate merchandise, or only breaking knees when it can plausibly be claimed as an act of personal revenge. Others join up with crews for protection, or with the Guild itself. A few former Guild members have been cast out of the organization due to incompetence or after offending a more powerful member, and now shuffle for scraps to survive.": "在博德之门，没有哪个职业罪犯是不知道行会的存在的。有些人刻意保持低调，只是偶尔带着合法的货物偷渡，或者只有在可以合理地声称是个人报复行为时才会毁掉膝盖。另一些人为了保护自己，加入了一些团队，或者加入了公会本身。一些前公会成员由于无能或得罪了更有权势的成员而被赶出了组织，现在为了生存而混迹于废墟。",
	"From the Oasis Theater's spectacular singers and acrobats to the pantomimes and shadow puppeteers of the Wide, Baldur's Gate hosts a colorful array of performers. Good acts can always find ready audiences, and the constant flow of travelers means that both new spectators and new spectacles are always passing through.": "从绿洲剧院壮观的歌手和杂技演员到广域的哑剧和皮影戏演员，博德之门拥有丰富多彩的表演者队伍。好的表演总是能找到现成的观众，而不断涌入的旅行者意味着新的观众和新的景象总是会经过这里。",
	"Baldur's Gate is a city badly in need of heroes, and every so often, one rises from among its own. Ordinary people who rise to greatness are beloved in local history, but the popular imagination can turn on such champions almost as quickly as it anoints them.": "博德之门是一个非常需要英雄的城市，而每隔一段时间，就会有一个人从自己的城市中崛起。在当地的历史上，那些崛起的普通人是受人爱戴的，但大众的想象力几乎可以在给他们涂脂抹粉的同时就把这些冠军反过来。",
	"Numerous guilds and professional associations exist in Baldur's Gate, covering every imaginable trade and discipline from gravediggers to moneylenders.": "博德之门》中存在众多的行会和职业协会，涵盖了从掘墓人到放债人等各种可以想象的行业和学科。",
	"While some might think it strange to find hermits in a bustling city, others know that sometimes the most profound solitude exists in the midst of a crowd. Baldur's Gate holds a handful of souls who manage to find isolation amid its tumult.": "虽然有些人可能认为在繁华的城市中找到隐士是很奇怪的，但其他人知道，有时最深刻的孤独存在于人群之中。博德之门有少数灵魂，他们设法在喧嚣中找到孤独。",
	"The patriars of Baldur's Gate live in the Upper City, where they host grand galas and flaunt cosmopolitan fashions, but are walled off from the poverty and squalor of the less fortunate districts and their neighborhoods. Although they might visit prosperous Bloomridge to try a fashionable restaurant or boutique, or watch a spectacle at the Oasis Theater, the patriars have little reason to venture into the dirtier, more dangerous parts of the city. If they do, it is generally as thrill-seeking tourists or enclosed by a retinue of armed guards, not as friends or neighbors. As a result, many patriars are at once acutely attuned to the nuances of royal courts half a continent away and shockingly ignorant of what life is like for the poor outside their own doorsteps.": "博德之门的元老们住在上城，他们在那里举办盛大的晚会，炫耀国际大都市的时尚，但却与不太幸运的地区及其附近的贫穷和肮脏隔绝。虽然他们可能会去繁华的布卢姆里奇（Bloomridge），尝试一下时尚的餐厅或精品店，或在绿洲剧院观看一场表演，但爱国者们几乎没有理由冒险进入城市中更肮脏、更危险的地方。如果他们这样做，通常是作为寻求刺激的游客，或被武装警卫的随从包围，而不是作为朋友或邻居。因此，许多家长既对半个大陆以外的皇室法庭的细微差别非常敏感，又对自己家门口的穷人的生活状况一无所知，令人震惊。",
	"This combination of worldly savvy and local blindness characterizes almost all the nobility of Baldur's Gate. As a result, for those who wish to play patriars, the Patriar feature below replaces the Position and Privilege feature of the noble background. Those who wish to use the background's standard feature might have gained their standing in Baldur's Gate from business rather than inheritance.": "这种世俗的精明和地方的盲目性的结合，几乎是《博德之门》中所有贵族的特点。因此，对于那些希望扮演族长的人来说，下面的族长特征取代了贵族背景的职位和特权特征。那些希望使用背景的标准特征的人可能是通过商业而不是继承获得他们在博德之门的地位。",
	"Coming to Baldur's Gate might seem like a good idea for a spectrum of reasons. Profit, excitement, and cosmopolitan opportunities all present tempting prospects, but rarely does one start on the path to Baldur's Gate fully understanding the complex social morass that awaits. You enter the city an outsider, and it's likely that—no matter how long you spend in the city—you'll leave an outsider, if you leave at all.": "出于各种原因，来到博德之门似乎是一个好主意。利润、兴奋和世界性的机会都呈现出诱人的前景，但很少有人在开始前往博德之门的道路上充分了解等待他们的复杂社会困境。你进入这个城市时是个局外人，而且很可能--无论你在这个城市呆多久--你都会以局外人的身份离开，如果你真的离开的话。",
	"Baldur's Gate has a modest academic community centered around the libraries of the High Hall and the various temples dedicated to gods of learning and innovation. Lecturers, researchers, and historians all participate with passing scholars from Candlekeep in a lively exchange of ideas, debating and collaborating in book-filled halls across the Upper and Lower City. The city is also rife with opportunities for arcane study, although its masters are dispersed across individual wizards' abodes and lack concentrated communities.": "博德之门有一个适度的学术社区，其中心是高阶大厅的图书馆和各种供奉学习和创新之神的神庙。讲师、研究人员和历史学家都与来自烛台镇的过往学者一起参与了活跃的思想交流，在上下城充满书香的大厅里进行辩论和合作。这个城市也充满了研究奥术的机会，尽管它的大师们分散在各个巫师的住处，缺乏集中的社区。",
	"Baldur's Gate was founded by sailors, and its harbor is still the city's beating heart. Several patriars are descended from captains of yore, the commerce of the Lower City is built on the port, and even the Outer City's rhythms are dominated by the ebb and flow of river trade. Because sailors are as fundamental and ubiquitous to Baldur's Gate as the cobbles on its streets, characters with this background are common.": "博德之门是由水手建立的，它的港口仍然是这个城市的心脏。有几位元老是过去的船长的后代，下城的商业是建立在港口之上的，甚至外城的节奏也是由河流贸易的起伏所主导的。由于水手是博德之门的基础，就像街道上的鹅卵石一样无处不在，因此具有这种背景的人物很常见。",
	"Mercenaries, private guards, Watch soldiers, and members of the Flaming Fist number among just a few of the many soldiers on the streets of Baldur's Gate.": "雇佣兵、私人卫兵、守望先锋士兵和火焰之拳的成员只是博德之门街道上众多士兵中的少数。",
	"Bands of orphans and runaways band together in the Outer City, running after passersby in ragged throngs to plead for scraps. In the Lower City, urchins are often recruited into the lowest echelons of the Guild or pressed into dirty and dangerous work by unscrupulous masters.": "成群结队的孤儿和离家出走的人在外城结伴而行，衣衫褴褛地跟在路人身后，恳求得到一点食物。在下城，顽童经常被招募到公会的最底层，或者被无良的主人逼迫从事肮脏和危险的工作。",
	"You are an informant for the Tears of Virulence who now lord over Phlan, but are also a double agent for original town guard of Phlan, the Black Fists. For the Tears you've been tasked with ferreting out the secrets of Phlan's criminal underworld, insurgency, and the common peoples of Phlan. In exchange for reporting on the activities of dissenters, criminals, and other rebel elements, the Tears of Virulence leave you alone to conduct your affairs in peace.": "你是 \"邪恶之泪 \"的线人，他们现在统治着普兰市，但同时也是普兰市原镇守部队 \"黑拳 \"的双重间谍。你的任务是为 \"恶灵之泪 \"探寻普兰的地下犯罪组织、叛乱组织和普兰的普通民众的秘密。作为对异见者、罪犯和其他叛乱分子活动的报告的交换，\"毒泪 \"让你独自在和平中处理你的事务。",
	"In reality you work for the deposed Black Fists, sharing misinformation with the Tears of Virulence that often helps the Black Fists and other Phlan insurgents. Since the evacuation of Phlan, you are even busier today than you ever were previously, as the number of dissenters among the refugees grows daily, while you are afforded many opportunities to spy on the peoples of Mulmaster and Elventree, to the pleasure of your contact(s) within the Tears of Virulence.": "实际上，你为被废黜的黑拳组织工作，与 \"邪恶之泪 \"分享错误信息，这些信息经常帮助黑拳组织和其他普兰叛乱分子。自从普兰岛被疏散后，你现在比以前更忙了，因为难民中持不同意见的人每天都在增加，同时你有很多机会监视穆尔马斯特和艾尔文特里的人民，让你在 \"病毒之泪 \"的联系人感到高兴。",
	"As a member of the Boros Legion, your life is devoted to the service of angels and consecrated to the work of establishing justice and peace on the streets of Ravnica. You might be a true believer, inspired by the example of the angels, moved by the plight of the downtrodden, and devoted to the cause of justice. Or you could be a cynic in the ranks, perhaps because you reluctantly followed in the footsteps of a Boros parent, succumbed to the persuasion of a charismatic recruiter's lofty promises, or were drawn in by the prospect of a life of action.": "作为波洛军团的一员，你的生命致力于为天使服务，并将其奉献给在拉夫尼卡的街道上建立正义与和平的工作。你可能是一个真正的信徒，被天使的榜样所鼓舞，被受压迫者的困境所感动，并致力于正义的事业。或者你可能是队伍中的一个愤青，也许是因为你不情愿地追随了一个博罗家长的脚步，屈服于一个有魅力的招募者的崇高承诺的劝说，或者被行动的生活的前景所吸引。",
	"You are used to life on the road. You pride yourself at having traveled every major trade way in the Moonsea region, including the best backroads and shortcuts. When traveling these roads, you know where the best inns, campsites, and water sources are located, as well as potential locations of danger such as ambush. Having worked the roads as long as you have, you have made many acquaintances and find it easy to pick up information and rumors floating from town to town. You are skilled with beasts of burden and handling and repairing wagons of all kinds.": "你已经习惯了在路上的生活。你为自己走遍了月海地区的每一条主要贸易道路而自豪，包括最好的小路和捷径。当你在这些道路上旅行时，你知道哪里有最好的旅店、露营地和水源，以及潜在的危险地点，例如埋伏。像你一样长期在路上工作，你已经结识了许多人，并发现很容易收集到信息和从城镇到城镇的传言。你能熟练地驾驭牲畜，处理和修理各种马车。",
	"Your family name strikes fear and admiration in the hearts of the common folk—but that's got nothing to do with you. Songs and stories celebrating the adventuring exploits of your famous parent are widely known. Kids across the land grew up wishing they were you. But being the child of a famous adventurer wasn't all hugs and kisses.": "你的姓氏在普通人心中引起了恐惧和钦佩，但这与你无关。歌颂你著名的父母的冒险经历的歌曲和故事广为人知。全国各地的孩子们长大后都希望自己是你。但作为一个著名冒险家的孩子，并不是只有拥抱和亲吻。",
	"You seldom saw your celebrity-adventurer parent, and when they were around, it was all about them and tales of slaying this demon or vanquishing that dragon. All too often, you'd be woken out of a sound sleep by someone standing outside your home screaming about the latest threat to the town, the region, or the world.": "你很少看到你的名人冒险家父母，当他们在你身边时，都是关于他们和杀死这个恶魔或征服那个龙的故事。很多时候，你会从酣睡中被站在你家门口的人叫醒，大喊着对这个镇、这个地区或这个世界的最新威胁。",
	"In the end, all you have to show for your lineage is your name. Most of the family's money went for consumables, from potions of healing and spell scrolls to copious amounts of dwarven ale. And everyone expects you to swing a sword or sling spells like your famous forebear, making it doubly hard for you to prove yourself.": "到头来，你的血统所能展示的只是你的名字。家族的大部分钱都用于购买消耗品，从治疗药水和法术卷轴到大量的矮人麦酒。而且每个人都希望你能像你著名的先辈一样挥舞剑或投掷法术，这使你加倍难以证明自己。",
	"You have always had a way with people. You know what makes them tick, you can tease out their hearts' desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read like they were children's books. It's a useful talent, and one that you're perfectly willing to use for your advantage": "你对人总是很有办法。你知道是什么让他们心动，你可以在几分钟的谈话后挑出他们内心的渴望，并且通过一些引导性的问题，你可以像阅读儿童读物一样阅读他们。这是一种有用的天赋，你完全愿意为自己的利益而使用。",
	"You know what people want and you deliver, or rather, you promise to deliver. Common sense should steer people away from things that sound too good to be true, but common sense seems to be in short supply when you're around. The bottle of pink-colored liquid will surely cure that unseemly rash, this ointment–nothing more than a bit of fat with a sprinkle of silver dust–can restore youth and vigor, and there's a bridge in the city that just happens to be for sale. These marvels sound implausible, but you can make them sound like the real deal.": "你知道人们想要什么，你就提供什么，或者说，你承诺会提供。常识应该引导人们远离那些听起来好得不像真的东西，但当你在身边时，常识似乎很缺乏。这瓶粉红色的液体肯定能治愈那不体面的皮疹，这种药膏--只不过是一点脂肪加一点银粉--能恢复青春和活力，而且城里有一座桥，正好可以出售。这些奇迹听起来难以置信，但你可以让它们听起来像真实的交易。",
	"You have served the community where you grew up, standing as its first line of defense against crime. You aren't a soldier, directing your gaze outward at possible enemies. Instead, your service to your hometown was to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe.": "你为你成长的社区服务，站在社区的第一道防线上打击犯罪。你不是一个士兵，把你的目光投向外面可能的敌人。相反，你对家乡的服务是帮助维持民众的治安，保护公民免受各种违法者和恶棍的侵害。",
	"You might have been part of the City Watch of Waterdeep, the baton-wielding police force of the City of Splendors, protecting the common folk from thieves and rowdy nobility alike. Or you might have been one of the valiant defenders of Silverymoon, a member of the Silverwatch or even one of the magic-wielding Spellguard.": "你可能是沃特迪普（Waterdeep）城市守望的一员，辉煌之城挥舞着警棍的警察部队，保护普通人免受盗贼和暴躁的贵族的侵害。或者你可能是银月城英勇的保卫者之一，银色守望的成员，甚至是挥舞着魔法的咒语卫士之一。",
	"Perhaps you hail from Neverwinter and have served as one of its Wintershield watchmen, the newly founded branch of guards who vow to keep safe the City of Skilled Hands.": "也许你来自永夜城，并曾担任过它的温特斯盾守卫者，这是一个新成立的守卫分支，他们发誓要维护熟练之手城的安全。",
	"Even if you're not city-born or city-bred, this background can describe your early years as a member of law enforcement. Most settlements of any size have their own constables and police forces, and even smaller communities have sheriffs and bailiffs who stand ready to protect their community.": "即使你不是在城市出生或在城市长大，这种背景也可以描述你作为执法部门成员的早年经历。大多数任何规模的定居点都有自己的警员和警察部队，甚至较小的社区也有随时准备保护社区的警长和法警。",
	"The Stout Folk are well known for their artisanship and the worth of their handiworks, and you have been trained in that ancient tradition. For years you labored under a dwarf master of the craft, enduring long hours and dismissive, sour-tempered treatment in order to gain the fine skills you possess today.": "坚固民族以其工匠精神和手工制品的价值而闻名，而你在这一古老的传统中得到了训练。多年来，你在一位矮人工艺大师手下工作，忍受着漫长的时间和不屑一顾、脾气暴躁的待遇，以获得你今天拥有的精湛技艺。",
	"You are most likely a dwarf, but not necessarily—particularly in the North, the shield dwarf clans learned long ago that only proud fools who are more concerned for their egos than their craft turn away promising apprentices, even those of other races. If you aren't a dwarf, however, you have taken a solemn oath never to take on an apprentice in the craft: it is not for nondwarves to pass on the skills of Moradin's favored children. You would have no difficulty, however, finding a dwarf master who was willing to receive potential apprentices who came with your recommendation.": "你很可能是个矮人，但也不一定--特别是在北方，盾牌矮人氏族很久以前就知道，只有那些更关心自我而不是手艺的骄傲的傻瓜才会拒绝有前途的学徒，甚至是其他种族的学徒。然而，如果你不是矮人，你已经发过庄严的誓言，永远不收手艺学徒：非矮人是不能传授莫拉丁宠儿的技艺的。不过，你不难找到一个愿意接收由你推荐的潜在学徒的矮人师傅。",
	"As a child, you were inquisitive when your playmates were possessive or raucous. In your formative years, you found your way to one of Faerûn's great institutes of learning, where you were apprenticed and taught that knowledge is a more valuable treasure than gold or gems. Now you are ready to leave your home—not to abandon it, but to quest for new lore to add to its storehouse of knowledge.": "小时候，当你的玩伴占有欲强或喧闹的时候，你就会感到好奇。在你成长的岁月里，你找到了去法鲁恩的一所伟大的学习机构的途径，在那里你被收为学徒，并被告知知识是比黄金或宝石更宝贵的财富。现在你准备离开你的家园--不是为了抛弃它，而是为了寻求新的传说，为它的知识宝库增添新的内容。",
	"The most well known of Faerûn's fonts of knowledge is Candlekeep. The great library is always in need of workers and attendants, some of whom rise through the ranks to assume roles of greater responsibility and prominence. You might be one of Candlekeep's own, dedicated to the curatorship of what is likely the most complete body of lore and history in all the world.": "法鲁恩的知识宝库中最著名的是烛台。这个伟大的图书馆总是需要工人和服务员，其中一些人通过等级晋升，承担更大的责任和地位。你可能是烛龙镇的一员，专门负责管理这个可能是世界上最完整的传说和历史。",
	"Perhaps instead you were taken in by the scholars of the Vault of the Sages or the Map House in Silverymoon, and now you have struck out to increase your knowledge and to make yourself available to help those in other places who seek your expertise. You might be one of the few who aid Herald's Holdfast, helping to catalogue and maintain records of the information that arrives daily from across Faerûn.": "也许你被贤者之库的学者或银月城的地图馆收留，而现在你已经出走，以增加你的知识，并使自己能够帮助那些在其他地方寻求你的专长的人。你可能是协助先驱者之城的少数人之一，帮助对每天从法鲁恩各地送来的信息进行编目和保存记录。",
	"The Cobalt Soul is an organization of monastic scholars dedicated to preserving knowledge and recorded history, not just across Wildemount but all of Exandria. Its operations are primarily based out of the cities of Zadash and Rexxentrum in the Dwendalian Empire, and you likely studied at one of those sites.": "钴之魂是一个由僧侣学者组成的组织，致力于保护知识和历史记录，不仅仅是在威尔德蒙，而是在整个艾克桑德里亚。它的业务主要是在德文达里亚帝国的扎达什和雷克森特鲁姆两座城市，而你很可能在其中一个地方学习。",
	"As a rank-and-file pupil of the Cobalt Soul, you adventure to help expand your mind. Alternatively (and with the DM's permission), you might also take on a more specific role within the organization. Expositors are secret agents who gather information in the field, while archivists are the curators who ensure the well-being of the Cobalt Soul's many Archives. Monks of the Cobalt Soul are enlightened scholars who lead expeditions into ancient and forgotten places, hoping to reclaim their lost knowledge and history.": "作为钴魂的一名普通学生，你的冒险有助于拓展你的思维。或者（在DM的允许下），你也可以在组织内担任一个更具体的角色。阐释者是在野外收集信息的秘密特工，而档案管理员则是确保钴之魂众多档案馆福祉的馆员。钴之魂的僧侣是开明的学者，他们带领探险队进入古老和被遗忘的地方，希望能找回他们失去的知识和历史。",
	"You are one of hundreds of refugees that were driven from Hillsfar or that fled the destruction of Myth Drannor and who now shelter in hidden camps under the northern eaves of the Cormanthor Forest. If you up grew in the camps, you have never been to a settlement other than the village of Elventree. As a guest of the elves, you have learned their ways and the ways of the forest. You are also a traumatized, as residual wild magic, energies released by the fall of Thultanar upon Myth Drannor, and the constant fear of raids hunting for nonhumans to fight in Hillsfar's Arena have taken their toll on you, as they have on everyone in the camps.": "你是数以百计的难民之一，他们被赶出希尔斯法尔，或逃离神话德兰诺的毁灭，现在躲在科曼托森林北部屋檐下的隐藏营地。如果你是在营地里长大的，那么你就从来没有去过精灵之树村以外的定居点。作为精灵的客人，你已经学会了他们的方式和森林的方式。你也是一个受创伤的人，因为残留的野性魔法、图尔坦纳在神话德兰诺沦陷时释放的能量，以及对在希尔斯法尔竞技场猎杀非人类的突击队的持续恐惧，都对你产生了影响，就像对营地里的每个人一样。",
	"In your earlier days, you were a personage of some significance in a noble court or a bureaucratic organization. You might or might not come from an upper-class family; your talents, rather than the circumstances of your birth, could have secured you this position.": "在你早期，你是一个贵族宫廷或官僚组织中的重要人物。你可能来自上流社会的家庭，也可能不是；你的才能，而不是你的出生环境，可能为你争取到这个位置。",
	"You might have been one of the many functionaries, attendants, and other hangers-on in the Court of Silverymoon, or perhaps you traveled in Waterdeep's baroque and sometimes cutthroat conglomeration of guilds, nobles, adventurers, and secret societies. You might have been one of the behind-the-scenes law-keepers or functionaries in Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter, or you might have grown up in and around the castle of Daggerford.": "你可能是银月宫廷中的众多官员、侍从和其他挂名者之一，或者你可能在沃特德普的巴洛克式的、有时是残酷的公会、贵族、冒险者和秘密社团的联合体中旅行。你可能是博德之门（Baldur's Gate）或永夜（Neverwinter）的幕后守法者或职能人员之一，或者你可能在达格福德（Daggerford）城堡里和周围长大。",
	"Even if you are no longer a full-fledged member of the group that gave you your start in life, your relationships with your former fellows can be an advantage for you and your adventuring comrades. You might undertake missions with your new companions that further the interest of the organization that gave you your start in life. In any event, the abilities that you honed while serving as a courtier will stand you in good stead as an adventurer.": "即使你不再是让你开始生活的组织的正式成员，你与以前的伙伴们的关系也可以成为你和你的冒险伙伴们的优势。你可以和你的新伙伴们一起执行任务，以促进让你开始生活的组织的利益。在任何情况下，你在当朝廷大臣时磨练出来的能力都会让你在冒险者中站稳脚跟。",
	"You are an experienced criminal with a history of breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among other criminals and still have contacts within the criminal underworld. You're far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of society.": "你是一个有经验的罪犯，有犯法的历史。你在其他罪犯中度过了很多时间，在犯罪的黑社会中仍有联系。你比大多数人更接近弥漫在文明底层的谋杀、盗窃和暴力的世界，你通过藐视社会的规则和条例而生存到现在。",
	"You're a spy. Secrets and misinformation are your stock in trade. You skulk in the shadows, infiltrate other guilds, and steal the most precious secrets, whether they're written in locked journals or hidden away in someone's mind. Even you might not be aware of all the reasons behind the missions you carry out. Sometimes a mission's sole purpose is to conceal the motivation behind another strike performed in a different part of the city, or simply to spread fear.": "你是一个间谍。秘密和错误信息是你的本行。你躲在暗处，潜入其他公会，窃取最珍贵的秘密，无论它们是写在上锁的日记里还是藏在某人的脑海里。甚至你可能不知道你执行的任务背后的所有原因。有时，一项任务的唯一目的是为了掩盖在城市不同地区进行的另一次打击背后的动机，或者仅仅是为了散布恐惧。",
	"As part of your covert work for House Dimir, you maintain a false identity as a member of another guild. You can choose your secondary guild or roll to determine it randomly. This secondary guild membership determines a portion of your starting equipment and is also where most of your contacts come from. You infiltrate your secondary guild to learn its secrets, keep tabs on its activities, or perhaps undermine it from within.": "作为你为迪米尔家族秘密工作的一部分，你保持一个假的身份，作为另一个公会的成员。你可以选择你的次级公会，也可以通过掷骰子来随机决定。这个次级公会的成员资格决定了你的部分起始装备，也是你的大部分联系人的来源。你潜入你的二级公会，了解它的秘密，监视它的活动，或者也许从内部破坏它。",
	"Even in the carefully constructed and curated city-state of Naktamun, and in the presence of the five gods, some people rebel against the doctrines of the God-Pharaoh. They don't challenge the existence of the gods, of course, for those gods are visible nearly every day in the streets of the city. Nor do they question the fact of life after death, which is plain to see in the anointed mummies that surround them, as well as the marauding mummies outside the Hekma. Rather, these dissenters simply refuse to follow the ordained course of life that leads to the glorious afterlife.": "即使在精心建造和策划的纳克塔蒙城邦中，在五位神的面前，一些人也对神-法老的教义产生了反抗。当然，他们并不质疑诸神的存在，因为这些神灵几乎每天都能在城市的街道上看到。他们也不质疑死后生命的事实，这在他们周围的受膏木乃伊以及赫克马外面的掠夺性木乃伊中是显而易见的。相反，这些持不同意见的人只是拒绝遵循通往辉煌来世的既定生活路线。",
	"Some dissenters are spurred by fear, not wanting to subject themselves to a violent death in the trials (or in training for the trials). Some are moved by conscience, unwilling to kill their crop-mates in the trials. For while they cannot deny that the gods exist, they can deny that the gods are just—and can fight to prove that the dictates of an unjust god need not be obeyed. Some believe that one god (probably Bontu) has corrupted the process of the trials and the path to the afterlife. Others correctly intuit that the God-Pharaoh did not actually have the people's best interests in mind when he ordered their society.": "一些异议者受到恐惧的刺激，不想让自己在试验中（或为试验进行训练）遭受暴力死亡。有些人受良心的驱使，不愿意在审判中杀死他们的庄稼人。因为虽然他们不能否认神的存在，但他们可以否认神是公正的--并且可以通过斗争来证明不公正的神的命令不需要被服从。一些人认为，一个神（可能是邦图）破坏了试炼的过程和通往来世的道路。其他人正确地直觉到，神-法老在命令他们的社会时，实际上并没有考虑到人民的最大利益。",
	"A character who is identified as a dissenter loses the benefit of the initiate's or vizier's background feature. In its place, the character gains the Shelter of Dissenters feature.": "被认定为异见者的角色会失去初始者或宰相的背景特征的好处。取而代之的是，该角色获得异见者的庇护功能。",
	"When the Maimed Virulence descended upon Phlan, you were one of the unfortunate casualties of war. Captured during the initial assault, you have spent the last year of your life as a plaything of a capricious and malevolent overlord. While many of your fellow prisoners fell to the dragon's insatiable fury over the coming months, you and your fellow \"survivors\" were spared only for a worse fate as one of the dragon's magical experiments, leaving you and those who survived the torture scarred and disfigured.": "当Maimed Virulence降临Phlan时，你是战争中不幸的牺牲品之一。在最初的攻击中被俘，你在过去的一年里一直是一个任性和恶毒的霸主的玩物。在接下来的几个月里，你的许多同伴都倒在了巨龙贪得无厌的怒火之下，而你和你的同伴 \"幸存者 \"却因为巨龙的魔法实验之一而幸免于难，使你和那些在折磨中幸存下来的人留下了伤痕和毁容。",
	"What reasons the dragon had for releasing you few survivors, nobody knows. You only fear that those who died under his terrible claw were the lucky ones, and you and your fellow Dragonscarred are doomed for a fate worse than death.": "那条龙释放你们这几个幸存者的原因是什么，没人知道。你只担心那些死在他可怕的爪子下的人是幸运者，而你和你的龙族同胞注定要面临比死亡更糟糕的命运。",
	"You are a down-on your luck miner from the Earthspur Mountains who is no stranger to hardship. You have spent a great deal of time living among the dwarves, goliaths, and denizens of the Underdark that also work mines in the area. At this point, you're just as comfortable working underground as above. You know how to read a seam, dicker for supplies with the deep gnomes, party with dwarves, and find your way back to the surface afterwards. Unfortunately, you haven't struck it rich...yet. Although you've come to Mulmaster looking for work, the tall peaks and deep mines of the Earthspurs still call to you.": "你是一个来自地刺山脉的倒霉矿工，对困难并不陌生。你已经在矮人、巨人和地下世界的居民中生活了很长时间，他们也在这个地区的矿场工作。在这一点上，你在地下和地上工作一样自如。你知道如何读懂地缝，与深层地精争夺物资，与矮人聚会，并在事后找到回到地面的方法。不幸的是，你还没有发财......还没有。虽然你来到穆尔玛斯特寻找工作，但地刺的高大山峰和深层矿井仍在召唤着你。",
	"You thrive in front of an audience. You know how to entrance them, entertain them, and even inspire them. Your poetics can stir the hearts of those who hear you, awakening grief or joy, laughter or anger. Your music raises their spirits or captures their sorrow. Your dance steps captivate, your humor cuts to the quick. Whatever techniques you use, your art is your life.": "你在观众面前茁壮成长。你知道如何吸引他们，取悦他们，甚至激励他们。你的诗学可以搅动那些听到你的人的心，唤醒悲伤或快乐，笑声或愤怒。你的音乐能提高他们的精神，或抓住他们的悲伤。你的舞步让人着迷，你的幽默让人茅塞顿开。无论你使用什么技巧，你的艺术就是你的生命。",
	"Being who you are, you could never be a hero. Whether due to your class, your people, your family, or your sins, something about you prevents you from effectively pursuing the path you've chosen. Even so, that doesn't stop you. You've left your old face behind, taking on a new persona, becoming something more.": "作为你的身份，你永远不可能成为一个英雄。无论是由于你的阶级、你的人民、你的家庭，还是你的罪过，你的某些方面使你无法有效地追求你所选择的道路。即便如此，这也不能阻止你。你已经把你的旧面孔抛在脑后，以新的身份，成为更多的人。",
	"Characters with the faceless background don a disguise—literally or otherwise—as they adventure. This persona might be dramatic or subtle. In a way, though, many characters have such larger than life personalities. Therefore, this background largely focuses on detailing the hero behind the mask.": "具有不露面背景的人物在冒险过程中会进行伪装，不管是口头上的还是其他方面的伪装。这种角色可能是戏剧性的，也可能是微妙的。不过，从某种程度上说，许多人物都有这种比生命更重要的个性。因此，这种背景在很大程度上侧重于详细描述面具背后的英雄。",
	"Many organizations active in the North and across the face of Faerûn aren't bound by strictures of geography. These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction's operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don't merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart.": "许多活跃在北方和整个法鲁恩的组织并不受地理环境的约束。这些派别追求他们的议程，不考虑政治边界，他们的成员在组织认为必要的任何地方活动。这些组织雇佣了听众、造谣者、走私者、售货员、藏匿者（保护财富或魔法的藏匿者，供该派系的特工使用）、避难所看守者和信息传递者，仅举几例。每个派别的核心是那些不仅仅是为该组织履行一个小职能的人，而是作为该组织的手、头和心脏。",
	"As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction in Faerûn. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own. Becoming an adventurer doesn't necessarily require you to relinquish membership in your faction (though you can choose to do so), and it might enhance your status in the faction.": "作为你冒险生涯的前奏（以及为其做准备），你曾在法鲁恩的某个特定派别担任代理人。你可能公开或秘密行动，这取决于该派别和它的目标，以及这些目标与你自己的目标是如何结合的。成为一名冒险家并不一定要求你放弃你的派别成员资格（尽管你可以选择这样做），而且这可能会提高你在派别中的地位。",
	"The lack of large, centralized governments in the North and along the Sword Coast is likely directly responsible for the proliferation of secret societies and conspiracies in those lands. If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some possibilities.": "北方和剑海岸一带缺乏大型的中央集权政府，这可能直接导致了这些土地上秘密社团和阴谋的扩散。如果你的背景是北方和剑岸的主要派别之一的特工，这里有一些可能性。",
	"On one level, the agents of the Lords' Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in {@skill History}, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance's ideals.": "在某种程度上，领主联盟的代理人是构成联盟的城市和其他政府的代表。但是，作为一个有着超越地方政治和地理的利益和关注的派别，联盟有自己的骨干，代表组织、更广泛的议程工作。联盟的代理人被要求具备{@skill History}的知识，并且可以一直依靠作为联盟一部分的政府的援助，加上其他坚持联盟理想的领导人和团体。",
	"Maybe you come from a long line of merchants. Perhaps you were an entrepreneur. Regardless, your ventures ended poorly. Whether it was because of outside influences, bad luck, or simply because your business acumen was weak, you lost everything.": "也许你来自一个长长的商人家族。也许你是一个企业家。无论怎样，你的创业都以失败告终。无论是因为外界的影响，运气不好，还是仅仅因为你的商业头脑薄弱，你都失去了一切。",
	"With failure, however, comes experience. You're free of that old life, having made some connections and learned your lessons. Prepared to pursue the life of an adventurer, your insight into the world of commerce brought you into the sphere of Acquisitions Incorporated—and a franchise just might be in your future.": "然而，有了失败，就有了经验。你已经摆脱了过去的生活，建立了一些联系并吸取了教训。你准备追求冒险家的生活，你对商业世界的洞察力把你带到了收购公司的领域--特许经营权可能就在你的未来。",
	"Almost all of the common people and other folk that one might encounter along the Sword Coast or in the North have one thing in common: they live out their lives without ever traveling more than a few miles from where they were born.": "在剑海岸或北方可能遇到的几乎所有普通人和其他民工都有一个共同点：他们在生活中从未离开过他们的出生地超过几英里。",
	"You aren't one of those folk.": "你不是这些人中的一员。",
	"You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to this part of Faerûn for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share.": "你来自一个遥远的地方，一个如此遥远的地方，以至于北方的普通人很少意识到它的存在，而且很有可能即使你遇到的一些人听说过你的祖国，他们也只是知道这个名字，也许还有一些离谱的故事。你来到法鲁恩的这个地方是有自己的原因的，你可以选择分享，也可以不分享。",
	"Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land's ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new wonders that you've never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you're a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go.": "尽管你无疑会发现这片土地上的一些方式是奇怪和令人不快的，但你也可以肯定，它的人们认为理所当然的一些东西对你来说是你以前从未见过的新奇事物。同样的道理，无论好坏，你几乎在任何地方都会成为你周围人感兴趣的人。",
	"The most important decision in creating a far traveler background is determining your homeland. The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this background.": "创建远行者背景的最重要决定是确定你的故乡。这里讨论的地方都离北方和剑海岸足够远，足以证明使用这种背景的合理性。",
	"The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faerûn. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your homeland.": "遥远的西方传说中的精灵岛是那些从未去过法鲁恩的精灵的家。当他们来到这里的时候，往往会发现这里比他们想象的要严酷。如果你是一个精灵，埃弗梅特是你故乡的合理选择（尽管不是必须的）。",
	"Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerûn for a purpose that benefits elven culture or society.": "大多数从Evermeet移民的人要么是流亡者，因为犯了一些违反精灵法律的罪行而被迫离开，要么是为了有利于精灵文化或社会的目的而来到Faerûn的使者。",
	"Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faerûn who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can work magic.": "哈尔鲁阿的魔法国度位于光辉南方的南部边缘，四周被山脉包围着，对于法鲁恩的大多数人来说，这是一片奇怪的土地。许多人听说过Halrua人驾驶的奇怪的天空之船，还有一些人知道即使他们中最普通的人也能施展魔法的传说。",
	"Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerûn for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa's many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods of magic.": "哈尔鲁亚人通常因个人原因进入法鲁恩，因为他们的政府对未经授权参与其他国家和组织有严格的立场。你可能因为违反了Halruaa的许多繁琐法律而被流放，或者你可能是一个寻求魔法之神的圣地的朝圣者。",
	"The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faerûn, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faerûn likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn't your true ethnicity, because that's the blanket term they use for everyone who shares your origin.": "远在法鲁恩东部的卡拉图尔（Kara-Tur）大陆，是剑海岸人民不熟悉的习俗的家园。如果你来自卡拉图尔，Faerûn的人们可能会称你为Shou，即使那不是你真正的种族，因为那是他们对与你有相同血统的人的总称。",
	"The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faerûn as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission was over.": "卡拉图尔的人们偶尔会以外交官的身份前往法鲁恩，或者与繁荣的商团建立贸易关系。你可能是作为这种代表团的一员来到这里，然后在任务结束后决定留下来。",
	"From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faerûn. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts of Faerûn.": "从地形到建筑再到统治这些土地的神王，穆尔霍兰德的一切对于来自剑海岸的人来说几乎都是陌生的。当你离开你的沙漠家园，来到法鲁恩北部陌生的气候时，你可能也经历了同样的文化冲击。你的家乡最近发生的事件导致了奴隶制的废除，以及穆尔霍兰德和法鲁恩遥远地区之间交通的相应增加。",
	"Those who leave behind Mulhorand's sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of your home.": "那些离开穆尔霍兰的炎热沙漠和古老的金字塔，去看一看不同的生活的人，有很多原因。你可能只是为了看看这片湿地所能提供的奇怪事物，或者是因为你在家乡的沙漠社区中树敌太多。",
	"Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed in white.": "很少有人听说过你的故乡，但很多人在看到你时都会对它产生疑问。来自索萨的人类似乎是由雪制成的，有着雪花般的皮肤和白色的头发，通常穿着白色的衣服。",
	"Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly important.": "索萨远在东北方，与北方的无尽冰川硬碰硬，另一边被数百英里的大冰川和大冰海所包围。如果没有令人信服的理由，你们国家的任何人都不会努力跨越这样巨大的障碍。你必须害怕一些真正可怕的东西，或者寻求一些难以置信的重要东西。",
	"As the saying goes among those in Faerûn who know of the place, \"To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.\" Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn't unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faerûn for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as you have.": "在法鲁恩知道这个地方的人中有这样的说法：\"要去扎哈拉，就往南走。然后再往南走一些。\" 当然，当你从你的出生地向北走的时候，你也走了同样长的路线。虽然扎哈拉人出于贸易目的访问法鲁恩的南部极端地区并不罕见，但很少有人像你这样离家这么远。",
	"You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your own deities.": "你可能是在旅行，以发现在你家乡的沙漠和剑一样的山脉之外还有什么奇迹，或者你是在朝圣，以了解别人所崇拜的神，以便你能更好地欣赏自己的神。",
	"Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place - but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you were a child.": "虽然你的家在物理上比这里讨论的其他地方更接近剑海岸，但它却更不自然。你来自地下城的某个定居点，每个定居点都有自己的奇怪习俗和法律。如果你是某个伟大的地下城市或定居点的本地人，你很可能是占据这个地方的种族成员--但你也可能是在小时候被俘虏并带到下面后在那里长大的。",
	"If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren't a native, your reason for leaving \"home\" probably has something to do with getting away from a bad situation.": "如果你是一个真正的地下城土著，你可能是作为你的人民的使者来到地面，或者也许是为了逃避对犯罪行为的指控（无论是否有理由）。如果你不是本地人，你离开 \"家 \"的原因可能是为了摆脱糟糕的处境。",
	"Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.": "你的口音、举止、说话方式，甚至可能是你的外表，都标志着你是外国人。无论你走到哪里，都会有人向你投来好奇的目光，这可能是一种困扰，但你也获得了学者和其他对遥远土地感兴趣的人的友好兴趣，更不用说那些渴望听到你家乡故事的普通人。",
	"You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.": "你可以将这种关注转化为你和你的旅伴接触到你可能没有的人和地方。高贵的领主、学者和商人王子，仅举几例，他们可能有兴趣了解你遥远的祖国和人民。",
	"You grew up in the Feywild after disappearing from your home plane as a child. Perhaps you were spirited away by kindly Fey who thought you were destined for great things. Perhaps you stumbled through a fey crossing by chance during a twilight stroll in the woods. Perhaps you were kidnapped by evil Fey but escaped from their clutches. Whatever the manner of your disappearance, you gradually fell under the Feywild's spell and learned a little about the nature of the mercurial tricksters that dwell there.": "你在童年时从你的母星上消失后，在精灵世界长大。也许你是被好心的费伊人带走的，他们认为你注定会有大作为。也许你在森林的黄昏漫步时，偶然穿过了一个费伊通道。也许你被邪恶的费伊绑架了，但从他们的魔掌中逃脱了。无论你是以何种方式失踪的，你都逐渐陷入了精灵世界的魔咒中，并对居住在那里的多变的骗子的本质有了一些了解。",
	"When you finally returned to your home plane, you did not come back unchanged. You are haunted by the fact that the Feywild—a mirror world hidden behind a mere twist of perception—is only a hair's breadth away. Although your memories of the Feywild grow fainter with each passing day, your heart swells with a mixture of fear and joy at the prospect of one day venturing back to the Plane of Faerie—your home away from home.": "当你最终回到你的母体世界时，你并没有原封不动地回来。你被这样一个事实所困扰：Feywild--一个隐藏在单纯的感知扭曲背后的镜像世界--离你只有一线之隔。虽然你对仙境的记忆与日俱减，但对于有朝一日能回到精灵界--你远离家乡的家--的前景，你的心涌动着恐惧和喜悦的混合物。",
	"You have spent your life aboard fishing vessels or combing the shallows for the bounty of the ocean. Perhaps you were born into a family of fisher folk, working with your kin to feed your village. Maybe the job was a means to an end—a way out of an undesirable circumstance that forced you to take up life aboard a ship. Regardless of how you began, you soon fell in love with the sea, the art of fishing, and the promise of the eternal horizon.": "你一生都在渔船上，或在浅滩上寻找海洋的丰收。也许你出生在一个渔民家庭，与你的亲戚一起工作，养活你的村庄。也许这份工作是一种手段，一种摆脱不良环境的方式，迫使你在船上生活。不管你是如何开始的，你很快就爱上了大海，爱上了捕鱼的艺术，爱上了永恒的地平线的承诺。",
	"You come from a humble social rank, but you are destined for so much more. Already the people of your home village regard you as their champion, and your destiny calls you to stand against the tyrants and monsters that threaten the common folk everywhere.": "你来自一个卑微的社会等级，但你注定要做得更多。你家乡的人们已经把你当作他们的冠军，你的命运召唤你去对抗威胁各地平民的暴君和怪物。",
	"All you need to make a lot of gold is a little gold. Except at those times when all you need to have no gold at all is a little gold. Whether you're a good gambler or a bad one rarely matters, because no one can divine the whims of Lady Luck. Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down. But the thing about gambling is that someone is always willing to take a bet.": "赚取大量黄金所需的是一点黄金。除非在那些时候，你需要的是一点黄金，而不是没有黄金。你是一个好的赌徒还是一个坏的赌徒并不重要，因为没有人能够预测幸运女神的旨意。有时你赢了，有时你输了。但关于赌博的事情是，总有人愿意下注。",
	"All traffic into and out of the City of Trade passes through the Hillsfar Gate, making it the ideal place for the destitute to gather to panhandle, busk, gossip, and pick pockets. You grew up on the streets in the shadow of that great steel edifice, which houses both Red Plumes and Guild Mages. Though you may have moved on, you still have friends among them, and that life has had a lasting impact on you.": "进出贸易城的所有交通都要经过希尔斯法尔门，这使它成为穷人聚集在一起摆摊、卖艺、闲聊和扒窃的理想场所。你是在那座伟大的钢铁大厦的阴影下长大的，那里有红羽和公会法师。虽然你可能已经搬走了，但你在他们中间仍有朋友，这种生活对你产生了持久的影响。",
	"You are a member of a teeming horde—one small part of a sprawling organism. Just as you are part of the swarm, the swarm is part of a larger ecosystem, a never-ending cycle of life, death, rot, and rebirth. You have spent your life in the slow churn of that ecosystem, in the dark places of the city where the messy parts of existence are on display. There is little squeamishness among the Golgari, no fear of death or taboo about the dead, just a fierce affirmation of the cycle.": "你是一群人中的一员，是一个庞大的有机体中的一个小部分。就像你是蜂群的一部分，蜂群也是一个更大的生态系统的一部分，是一个生命、死亡、腐烂和重生的永无止境的循环。你已经在这个生态系统的缓慢搅动中度过了你的一生，在城市的黑暗地方，生存的混乱部分被展示出来。戈尔加里人中没有什么胆怯，没有对死亡的恐惧或对死者的禁忌，只是对循环的激烈肯定。",
	"The Golden Grin began in the far-off land of Tal'Dorei, trading secret messages through a network of bards and minstrels to undermine an iron-fisted king's authoritarian rule. Today, Tal'Dorei is a relatively peaceful republic, and some Grinners have grown restless while waiting for tyranny to raise its ugly head again. A contingent of such Grinners traveled to the Menagerie Coast and set up a network of secret bases in the cities of the Clovis Concord, from which they are presently working their way into the highest echelons of the Dwendalian Empire.": "金色格林始于遥远的塔尔多雷（Tal'Dorei），通过吟游诗人和吟游诗人的网络交易秘密信息，以破坏铁腕国王的独裁统治。今天，Tal'Dorei是一个相对和平的共和国，一些格林人在等待暴政再次抬头的同时也变得焦躁不安。一支这样的格林纳人队伍来到曼纳吉海岸，在克洛维斯协约的城市中建立了一个秘密基地网络，目前他们正从那里进入德文达里帝国的最高层工作。",
	"You are a Grinner. Your goals are to spread freedom and inspire hope—or, in time, revolution—in the hearts of the oppressed.": "你是一名磨练者。你的目标是传播自由，在被压迫者的心中激发希望--或者说，及时激发革命。",
	"All members of the Golden Grin have learned a handful of folk songs in their travels, and use those songs to send secret codes and alert fellow Grinners to danger. Choose a favorite song or roll on the Favorite Code-Songs table.": "Golden Grin的所有成员在旅行中都学会了一些民谣，并利用这些歌曲来发送秘密代码，提醒Grinners同伴注意危险。选择一首最喜欢的歌曲或在最喜欢的密码歌曲表上滚动。",
	"Zan's Comin' Back. This hopeful Tal'Dorei folk song declares the inevitable return of a just ruler. Use it to seek out potential allies.": "瓒回来了。这首充满希望的塔尔多雷民歌宣称一个正义的统治者将不可避免地回归。用它来寻找潜在的盟友。",
	"Blow Fire Down the Coast. A rowdy fighting song from the Clovis Concord, this ditty talks of blasting up pirate ships. Use it to encourage battle.": "把火烧到海岸。这是一首来自克洛维斯康科德的吵闹的战斗歌曲，这首小曲谈到了炸毁海盗船的问题。用它来鼓励战斗。",
	"Hush! Onward Come the Dragons. This Tal'Dorei folk song recounts the terror in the days after the invasion of the red dragon called the Cinder King. Use it to encourage caution in speech and deed.": "嘘! 巨龙来了。这首Tal'Dorei民歌讲述了被称为煤渣王的红龙入侵后几天的恐怖。用它来鼓励人们在言行上保持谨慎。",
	"Let the Sword Grow Rust. An antiwar anthem from Marquet, this song has uncertain origins. Use it to help quell violent encounters.": "让剑生锈。这是一首来自马奎特的反战歌，这首歌的起源不确定。用它来帮助平息暴力冲突。",
	"Drink Deep, Li'l Hummingbird. A drinking rondo from the Menagerie Coast, this song tells the tale of a young person who drinks so heavily that they awaken to find they've stowed away on a ship.

They were known for traveling to remote parishes plagued by unexplained murders, and for exposing werewolves living among normal humans. During Avacyn's absence, when the archangel was trapped within the demonic prison known as the Helvault, the inquisitors led a series of brutal forays into Kessig and the Gavony Moorland.

A noble title doesn't stand on its own—it's connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children.

Are you in your family's good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?": "你在家族中的地位是什么？你是一家之主的继承人吗？你已经继承了这个头衔吗？你对这个责任有什么感觉？还是说你的继承权太低，只要你不给家族丢脸，没人在乎你做什么？你的一家之主对你的冒险生涯有何看法？你是得到了家族的好感，还是被家族其他成员回避了？",

Even in places where you don't know the specific features of the terrain, you know the ways of the wild.": "你在荒野中长大，远离文明，远离城镇和技术的舒适性。你见证了比森林还大的兽群的迁徙，经历了比任何城市居民所能理解的更极端的天气，并享受了作为任何方向数英里内唯一有思想的生物的孤独感。荒野是你的血液，无论你是游牧者、探险家、隐居者、狩猎采集者，甚至是掠夺者。即使在你不知道地形的具体特征的地方，你也知道野外的方式。",
	"The taking of Phlan by Vorgansharax is a clear memory in your mind. You were going about your everyday business when the green dragon's forces spilled out of the sewers and assailed your home.

	"Rather than flee the region, you've chosen to stay and fight. Finding refuge outside the town and the deadly thicket surrounding it, you strike out against the Tears of the Virulence and their monstrous allies.

You've grown accustomed to acting under the cover of night, dealing what blows you can to avenge the friends and family you lost within the currently occupied Phlan. You will drive Vorgansharax out, or you die trying.": "你没有逃离这个地区，而是选择留下来战斗。在镇子和周围的致命灌木丛外找到避难所，你对 \"邪恶之泪 \"和他们可怕的盟友发动了攻击。你已经学会了在恶劣和绝望的环境中生存，补给不足，援军的到来也不确定。你已经习惯了在夜色的掩护下行动，尽你所能为你在目前被占领的普兰地区失去的朋友和家人报仇。你要把沃甘沙拉克斯赶出去，否则你就得死。",
	"Gone are the happier days of walking into the Laughing Goblin Inn after a hard day's labor. Everything has changed, and you are lucky to be alive. Back in Phlan you could count yourself among those street-wise folks who knew when to pay a bribe and who to work with to make a living.

	"Sure, accidents happen. But they seem to happen an awful lot when Acquisitions Incorporated operatives are on the scene. Naturally, nothing ever happens when there are no witnesses left behind.

If you're a half-elf, half-orc, or genasi, you disguise your non-human features. Other races use a combination of disguise and concealing clothing to hide. Your reasons for doing so are your own.

You recall sitting cross-legged hearing the stories of the glorious Thultanthar, also called the Shade Enclave and the City of Shade, and aspired to study there and maybe even did, for a time. Your dreams came crashing down a few years ago when Thultanthar fell from the sky upon Myth Drannor.

	"Food became scarcer for those without connections. You became a beggar and to stay alive you bartered information to any interested party with food or gold to spare. You were good at what you did, and thought you were invincible. That changed when you were captured by the Tears of Virulence, the soldiers of Vorgansharax, the Maimed Virulence, for selling secrets to those bent on overthrowing the dragon. They locked you in the cells of Stojanow Gate. The first weeks you hoped to stay alive. As the weeks turned into months, and the interrogations continued you began to pray for death.": "没有关系的人，食物变得越来越少。你成了一个乞丐，为了活命，你向任何有食物或黄金的感兴趣的人交换信息。你很擅长你的工作，并认为你是不可战胜的。当你被 \"病毒之泪\"（Tears of Virulence）俘虏时，情况发生了变化。\"病毒之泪 \"是Vorgansharax的士兵，也就是被打倒的 \"病毒\"，因为你向那些一心想推翻龙的人出售秘密。他们把你关在斯托扬诺门的牢房里。最初的几个星期，你希望能活下来。当几周变成几个月，审讯继续进行时，你开始祈求死亡。",
	"You were born into a nomadic tribe that called the Ticklebelly Hills home. You migrated from location to location, living off the land with your tribe.

	"In your migrations, your people have come to know the stone giant tribes that populate the Giant's Cairn. The dragon cultists came to the hills one day—magic-users wearing purple and riding horrid beasts, black-clad warriors wearing wicked masks, and even soldiers from the nearby town of Phlan. Then the dragon called Vorgansharax arrived and laired in the hills, causing horrid thickets to grow and animals to act unusually. The cultists began raiding nomad camps for victims to offer to the wyrm. Eventually, the dragon moved on to attack Phlan, but life was never again the same for the nomads of the Ticklebelly Hills.": "在你们的迁徙中，你们的人民已经认识了居住在巨人之穴的石巨人部落。有一天，龙的崇拜者来到了山上--穿着紫色衣服、骑着可怕的野兽的魔法使用者，戴着邪恶面具的黑衣战士，甚至还有来自附近的普兰镇的士兵。然后，被称为Vorgansharax的龙来到这里，并在山丘上筑巢，导致可怕的灌木丛生长和动物的异常行为。崇拜者们开始袭击游牧民族的营地，寻找受害者以献给巨龙。最终，巨龙转而攻击弗兰，但蒂克尔贝利山的游牧民的生活再也不一样了。",

	"You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor. You had no one to watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other desperate souls who might steal from you.

But for the last few generations, some bands among the tribes were tempted to settle, make peace, trade, and even to build towns. Perhaps this is why Uthgar chose to raise up the totems among the people as living embodiments of his power. Perhaps they needed a reminder of who they were and from whence they came. The Chosen of Uthgar led bands back to the old ways, and most of your people abandoned the soft ways of civilization.": "你的人民一直试图坚持旧的方式。传统和禁忌使乌斯加德人保持强大，而其他人的王国已经崩溃成混乱和毁灭。但在过去的几代人中，部落中的一些族群被诱惑着去定居、媾和、贸易，甚至去建立城镇。也许这就是为什么乌斯加选择在人们中间竖起图腾，作为他权力的活的体现。也许他们需要一个提醒，提醒他们是谁，他们从哪里来。乌斯加的神选者带领队伍回到了旧的方式，而你们大多数人都放弃了文明的软方式。",
	"You might have grown up in one of the tribes that had decided to settle down, and now that they have abandoned that path, you find yourself adrift. Or you might come from a segment of the Uthgardt that adheres to tradition, but you seek to bring glory to your tribe by achieving great things as a formidable adventurer.": "你可能在某个决定定居的部落中长大，而现在他们放弃了这条道路，你发现自己在漂泊。或者你可能来自乌斯加德的一个部分，坚持传统，但你寻求通过作为一个强大的冒险家取得伟大的成就来为你的部落带来荣耀。",
	"See the \"Uthgardt Lands\" section of chapter 2 for details on each tribe's territory and its activities that will help you choose your affiliation.": "关于每个部落的领地及其活动的详情，请参见第二章的 \"乌斯加特土地 \"部分，这将有助于你选择你的归属。",
	"Though this section details the Uthgardt specifically, either it or the outlander background from the Player's Handbook can be used for a character whose origin lies with one of the other barbarian tribes in Faerûn.": "虽然这一节专门介绍了乌斯加德，但无论是它还是《玩家手册》中的外乡人背景，都可以用于一个起源于法鲁恩其他野蛮人部落的角色。",
	"You might be a fair-haired barbarian of the Reghed, dwelling in the shadow of the Reghed Glacier in the far North near Icewind Dale. You might also be of the nomadic Rashemi, noted for their savage berserkers and their masked witches. Perhaps you hail from one of the wood elf tribes in the Chondalwood, or the magic-hating human tribes of the sweltering jungles of Chult.": "你可能是雷格德的一个白发野蛮人，居住在冰风谷附近遥远的北方雷格德冰川的阴影下。你也可能是游牧民族拉希米的人，他们以野蛮的狂暴者和戴面具的女巫而闻名。也许你来自琼达林的某个木精灵部落，或者来自楚尔特炎热的丛林中憎恨魔法的人类部落。",
	"Although your capabilities are not much different from those of a burglar or smuggler, you learned and practiced them in a very different context: as an espionage agent. You might have been an officially sanctioned agent of the crown, or perhaps you sold the secrets you uncovered to the highest bidder.": "虽然你的能力与窃贼或走私者没有什么不同，但你是在一个非常不同的背景下学习和实践的：作为一个间谍特工。你可能是官方认可的王室特工，也可能是把你发现的秘密卖给出价最高的人。",
	"A gladiator is as much an entertainer as any minstrel or circus performer, trained to make the arts of combat into a spectacle the crowd can enjoy. This kind of flashy combat is your entertainer routine, though you might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor. Using your By Popular Demand feature, you can find a place to perform in any place that features combat for entertainment–perhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret pit fighting club. You can replace the musical instrument in your equipment package with an inexpensive but unusual weapon, such as a trident or net.": "角斗士和任何吟游诗人或马戏团演员一样是个艺人，他们接受训练，将战斗的艺术变成观众可以欣赏的奇观。这种华丽的格斗是你的艺人常规，尽管你可能也有一些翻滚者或演员的技能。利用你的 \"大众需求 \"功能，你可以在任何以格斗为特色的娱乐场所--也许是角斗场或秘密坑道格斗俱乐部--找到一个表演场所。你可以用一种廉价但不寻常的武器来代替你装备包中的乐器，如三叉戟或网。",
	"Instead of an artisans' guild, you might belong to a guild of traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers. You don't craft items yourself but earn a living by buying and selling the works of others (or the raw materials artisans need to practice their craft). Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the region. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop. In some ways, the traveling merchant's life lends itself to adventure far more than the life of an artisan.": "你可能不属于工匠公会，而是属于商人、商队队长或店主的公会。你不自己制作物品，而是通过买卖他人的作品（或工匠们练习技艺所需的原材料）来谋生。你的行会可能是一个大型的商人财团（或家族），利益遍及整个地区。也许你用船、马车或商队把货物从一个地方运到另一个地方，或者从旅行商人那里购买货物，然后在自己的小店里出售。在某些方面，旅行商人的生活远比工匠的生活更适合冒险。",
	"A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps you put it on).": "在大多数社会中，骑士是最低的贵族头衔之一，但它可以是通往更高地位的途径。如果你想成为一名骑士，请选择留守者功能，而不是特权地位功能。你的一个平民家臣被一个贵族取代，他担任你的侍从，协助你，以换取他或她自己在骑士之路上的训练。你剩下的两个家臣可能包括一个照顾你的马的马夫和一个为你擦拭盔甲的仆人（甚至帮你穿上）。",
	"As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart–in a chaste sort of devotion. (This person could be your bond.)": "作为骑士精神和宫廷爱情理想的象征，你可以在你的装备中加入一面旗帜或其他来自贵族老爷或夫人的信物，你已经把你的心献给了他们--一种贞洁的奉献。(这个人可以作为你的纽带。）",
	"You spent your youth under the sway of a dread pirate, a ruthless cutthroat who taught you how to survive in a world of sharks and savages. You've indulged in larceny on the high seas and sent more than one deserving soul to a briny grave. Fear and bloodshed are no strangers to you, and you've garnered a somewhat unsavory reputation in many a port town.": "你在一个可怕的海盗手下度过了你的青春，一个无情的杀手，他教你如何在一个充满鲨鱼和野蛮人的世界里生存。你在公海上沉溺于偷窃，并将不止一个应得的灵魂送入盐水的坟墓。恐惧和流血对你来说并不陌生，你在许多港口城市获得了有点不光彩的声誉。",
	"If you decide that your sailing career involved piracy, you can choose the Bad Reputation feature instead of the Ship's Passage feature.": "如果你决定你的航海生涯涉及海盗行为，你可以选择 \"坏名声 \"功能，而不是 \"船舶通道 \"功能。",
	"You are a vizier, a servant of your god. You perform tasks that are essential to facilitating the initiates' journey, so the gods reward you with entry into the afterlife with the God-Pharaoh's blessing. You hope to achieve the most honored status in the afterlife by being the best possible servant to your god.": "你是一个宰相，是你的神的仆人。你执行的任务对促进入门者的旅程至关重要，因此神明奖励你在神-法老的祝福下进入来世。你希望通过成为你的神的最佳仆人，在来世获得最尊贵的地位。",
	"As a vizier, you can have any class, but you are especially likely to be a cleric, a druid (particularly if you serve Rhonas), or a paladin.": "作为宰相，你可以有任何等级，但你特别可能是牧师、德鲁伊（特别是如果你为罗纳斯服务的话）或帕拉丁。",
	"The Volstrucker are a clandestine organization of arcane assassins and enforcers in the service of the Cerberus Assembly. Their operatives bear no official title, but are referred to in hushed tones as \"scourgers\" by residents of large Dwendalian cities such as Zadash and Rexxentrum.": "Volstrucker是一个秘密组织，是为Cerberus大会服务的神秘刺客和执法者。他们的特工没有正式的头衔，但被德文达尔大城的居民，如扎达什和雷克森特鲁姆，以低调的语气称为 \"祸害\"。",
	"You are a Volstrucker agent. Your duty is to silence dissidents who would undermine the will of King Dwendal—and more importantly, the will of the Assembly.": "你是一名沃尔斯特鲁克的特工。你的职责是压制那些会破坏德文达尔国王意志的持不同政见者，更重要的是，压制大会的意志。",
	"Happy people aren't selected to join the Volstrucker. The Cerberus Assembly preys upon talented individuals who have been broken by tragedy—in some cases, tragedy that the Volstrucker has arranged for. A slightly broken mind is more easily reshaped and reeducated. Choose the tragedy that set you on this path, or roll on the Tragedies table.": "幸福的人不会被选中加入追风者。地狱犬大会的目标是那些被悲剧击垮的人才--在某些情况下，是追风者安排的悲剧。一个略微破碎的心灵更容易被重塑和再教育。选择让你走上这条道路的悲剧，或者在悲剧表上滚动。",
	"Familicide. Through deceit or manipulation, the Volstrucker convinced you to slaughter your own family.": "杀害家人。通过欺骗或操纵，Volstrucker说服你去屠杀自己的家人。",
	"Amnesia. You were forced to study magic so potent that it strained your mind beyond mortal limits, stealing away the memories of your past.": "失忆症。你被迫学习如此强大的魔法，以至于它使你的头脑紧张到超出凡人的极限，偷走了你过去的记忆。",
	"Capture. You were captured and tortured by agents of the Kryn Dynasty, and barely escaped.": "捕获。你被克莱恩王朝的特工俘虏并受到折磨，勉强逃脱。",
	"Starvation. A terrible blight afflicted your rural village, and many of your friends and family members starved to death. You survived, but only barely.": "饿死了。一场可怕的瘟疫折磨着你的农村，你的许多朋友和家人都饿死了。你活了下来，但只是勉强。",
	"Disfigurement. One of your arcane experiments went wrong and scarred or dismembered you so gravely that others now shun you. Only the Volstrucker showed you kindness after that day.": "毁容。你的一个奥术实验出了问题，使你留下了严重的疤痕或肢解，以至于其他人现在都躲着你。那天之后，只有Volstrucker对你表示善意。",
	"Vicissitude. You were once the scion of a wealthy family who lost their entire fortune in the blink of an eye.": "悲惨遭遇。你曾经是一个富裕家庭的后代，一眨眼就失去了所有的财富。",
	"You are a scion of one of the great noble families of Waterdeep. Human families who jealously guard their privilege and place in the City of Splendors, Waterdhavian nobles have a reputation across Faerûn for being eccentric, spoiled, venal, and, above all else, rich.": "你是沃特德普伟大的贵族家族之一的后代。沃特德的贵族们嫉妒地守护着他们在辉煌之城的特权和地位，他们在整个法鲁恩以古怪、被宠坏、贪婪，以及最重要的，富有而闻名。",
	"Whether you are a shining example of the reason for this reputation or one who proves the rule by being an exception, people expect things of you when they know your surname and what it means. Your reasons for taking up adventuring likely involve your family in some way: Are you the family rebel, who prefers delving in filthy dungeons to sipping zzar at a ball? Or have you taken up sword or spell on your family's behalf, ensuring that they have someone of renown to see to their legacy?": "无论你是这种声誉的光辉典范，还是以例外证明规则的人，当人们知道你的姓氏和它的含义时，都会对你有所期待。你从事冒险的原因很可能在某种程度上涉及到你的家庭。你是家族的叛逆者，宁愿在肮脏的地牢里钻来钻去，也不愿意在舞会上喝扎啤？或者你代表你的家族拿起了剑或咒语，确保他们有名望的人看到他们的遗产？",
	"Work with your DM to come up with the family you are part of—there are around seventy-five lineages in Waterdeep, each with its own financial interests, specialties, and schemes. You might be part of the main line of your family, possibly in line to become its leader one day. Or you might be one of any number of cousins, with less prestige but also less responsibility.": "和你的DM一起想出你所属的家族--在沃特德普大约有75个家族，每个家族都有自己的经济利益、专长和计划。你可能是你的家族主系的一部分，可能有一天会成为家族的领袖。或者你可能是任何数量的表亲之一，他们的声望较低，但责任也较小。",
	"You crept into the Witchlight Carnival as a child or youth and never looked back, earning a place among those who work behind the scenes to keep the carnival in business. As a hand, you work hard and party hard. The carnival has borne you to many fantastic worlds, circling back around to your home world once every eight years, but you know almost nothing about these worlds because you spend all your time in the carnival. You know the other hands well, but the carnival's owners—Mister Witch and Mister Light—remain mysterious to you even after all these years.": "你在儿童或青年时期就悄悄进入了巫师之光狂欢节，并且从未回头，在那些在幕后工作以维持狂欢节业务的人中赢得了一席之地。作为一名助手，你努力工作，努力聚会。嘉年华会带你到许多奇妙的世界，每八年绕回你的家乡一次，但你对这些世界几乎一无所知，因为你把所有时间都花在嘉年华会上。你很了解其他人，但嘉年华会的主人--女巫先生和光先生--即使过了这么多年，对你来说仍然是神秘的。",
	"Maybe you joined the carnival to escape a dismal life at home, or maybe you were enchanted by the idea of visiting new places or the dream of becoming one of the carnival's star attractions. Now that you're older, carnival life has lost some of its appeal. The daily routine has grown tedious, the cyclical nature of the carnival's journey monotonous. The carnival no longer fills your heart with a sense of wonder. Perhaps greater adventures await you beyond the carnival's gates.": "也许你加入狂欢节是为了逃避家里的凄凉生活，也许你被参观新地方的想法所迷惑，或者梦想成为狂欢节的明星景点之一。现在你长大了，狂欢节生活已经失去了一些吸引力。每天的例行公事已经变得乏味，狂欢节旅程的循环性质也变得单调。狂欢节不再让你的心充满惊奇感。也许在嘉年华会的大门之外有更大的冒险在等着你。",
	"You filled your childhood with rudimentary alchemical experiments, all in the hope of becoming a student of Witherbloom College. The life sciences are the focus of your reading, which include biology and necromancy. Brewing strange concoctions with medicinal properties, exploring the anatomies of monsters, and cataloging swamp flora are the kinds of studies you might pursue at Witherbloom College.": "你的童年充满了简陋的炼金术实验，都是希望成为威瑟布洛姆学院的学生。生命科学是你阅读的重点，其中包括生物学和死灵法术。酿造具有药用价值的奇怪药剂，探索怪物的解剖结构，以及对沼泽植物进行编目，都是你在威瑟布洛姆学院可能从事的研究。",
	"You have trained to be a valorous warrior known as a Knight of Solamnia. Strict rules guide your every action, and you work to uphold them as you strive to defend the weak and oppose evil. Your honor is as important to you as your life.": "你已经被训练成一名勇敢的战士，被称为索兰尼亚的骑士。严格的规则指导着你的每一个行动，你努力维护这些规则，努力捍卫弱者，反对邪恶。你的荣誉对你来说和你的生命一样重要。",
	"In the world of Krynn, many refer to the Mages of High Sorcery as the Wizards of High Sorcery. The organization accepts more than wizards, though, with sorcerers, warlocks, and other spellcasters included among their ranks.": "在克莱恩的世界里，许多人把高阶巫术法师称为高阶巫师。不过这个组织接受的不仅仅是巫师，还有巫师、术士和其他施法者，都在他们的行列中。",
	"You spent a significant amount of time somewhere influenced by a portal to another plane of existence or by intense planar forces. You're accustomed to experiences that would leave others reeling in terror or enraptured by otherworldly beauty, and you're as comfortable dealing with fiends and celestials as you are with vendors in town.": "你在某个被通往另一个存在平面的入口影响的地方或被强烈的平面力量影响的地方度过了大量的时间。你已经习惯了那些会让其他人惊恐万分或被另一个世界的美丽所迷惑的经历，你和恶魔和天体打交道就像和城里的小贩打交道一样自如。",
	"Though you aren't a Giant, you grew up among giants. Maybe you were an orphan taken in by a sympathetic family of stone giants who raised you as one of their own. Or perhaps you lived in a lost prehistoric pocket of the world, surrounded by giants and fearsome behemoths or hulking dinosaurs.": "虽然你不是巨人，但你是在巨人中长大的。也许你是一个孤儿，被一个富有同情心的石巨人家庭收留，他们把你当作自己人抚养。或者你生活在一个失落的史前世界，周围都是巨人和可怕的巨兽或笨重的恐龙。",
	"Something about your environment—perhaps the food or water that sustained you through childhood, elemental magic inherent in the site of your home, or some verdant blessing of growth placed on you—ensured that you grew to a remarkable size. With the aid of this magic, you have learned how to embody the titanic might of giants. You are used to moving through a world much bigger than you, and that is reflected in your skills, attitude, and perspective on life.": "你所处环境的某些因素--也许是支撑你度过童年的食物或水，你家园所在地所固有的元素魔法，或者是对你成长的某些青翠祝福--确保你成长为一个非凡的体型。在这种魔法的帮助下，你已经学会了如何体现巨人的力量。你已经习惯于在一个比你大得多的世界里活动，这反映在你的技能、态度和对生活的看法上。",
	"You subscribe to a distinct philosophy that seeks to understand the nature of the planes or some hidden truth of the multiverse. You draw strength from your conviction and, perhaps, a network of like-minded believers. In your travels, you seek to deepen the depths of your understanding and spread your philosophy.": "你认同一种独特的哲学，试图理解各平面的性质或多元宇宙的一些隐藏的真理。你从你的信念中汲取力量，也许还有一个志同道合的信徒网络。在你的旅行中，你寻求加深你的理解深度并传播你的哲学。",

Whether you were personally taught by a master rune carver or learned by poring over engravings in ancient ruins, you understand how to tap into the supernatural power held within runes.": "你一生都在研究符文术的实践。无论你是由符文雕刻大师亲自教导，还是通过翻阅古代遗迹中的雕刻来学习，你都明白如何利用符文中的超自然力量。",
	"The art of runecraft was initially created by the giants of yore, but over time, the practice has been adopted by individuals of all races and backgrounds. As such, though Giant runes are the most common, many rune carvers incorporate symbols from their native languages into the craft.": "符文艺术最初是由过去的巨人创造的，但随着时间的推移，这种做法已被所有种族和背景的人所采用。因此，尽管巨人符文是最常见的，但许多符文雕刻家也将其母语的符号融入到工艺中。",
	"For longer than you can remember, you have traversed the Astral Sea. There, you experienced firsthand the wonders of the Silver Void: you stopped aging and no longer felt hunger or thirst. Driven by wanderlust, you drifted from one part of the Astral Sea to another, like a mote of dust on the wind. You have lost count of the decades that have passed since you arrived here.": "在你记不清楚的时候，你已经穿越了星海。在那里，你亲身经历了银色虚空的奇迹：你不再衰老，不再感到饥渴。在游荡欲望的驱使下，你从星海的一个地方漂流到另一个地方，就像风中的一粒尘埃。自从你来到这里，你已经记不清楚已经过去了多少年。",
	"In your travels, you have camped on the petrified hulks of dead gods and narrowly escaped the psychic winds that sweep across the Astral Sea while also avoiding prolonged contact with the plane's most dangerous denizens.": "在你的旅行中，你曾在死去的神的残骸上安营扎寨，险些躲过席卷星海的精神之风，同时也避免了与这个星球上最危险的居民的长期接触。",
	"You were raised in the void of Wildspace—home to asteroid miners, moon farmers, and other hardy folk. Perhaps you grew up in a far-flung settlement such as the Rock of Bral (described in {@book chapter 3|AAG|3}), or you spent your early years on the crew of a spelljamming ship, performing helpful chores such as swabbing the deck, loading and offloading cargo, and scraping barnacles off the hull.": "你在荒野空间的虚空中长大--小行星矿工、月球农民和其他坚韧不拔的人的家。也许你是在一个遥远的定居点长大的，比如布拉尔岩石（在{@book chapter 3|AAG|3}中描述），或者你早年是在一艘法术干扰船的船员中度过的，从事一些有用的杂务，比如擦拭甲板、装卸货物，以及刮掉船体上的藤壶。",
	"Whatever your history, life in Wildspace has toughened you so well that you are as brave as a {@creature Space Hamster|BAM|miniature giant space hamster} when it comes to facing the terrors and other challenges of the airless night.": "无论你的历史如何，荒野空间的生活已经使你变得非常坚韧，当你面对无空气的夜晚的恐怖和其他挑战时，你就像一个{@creature Space Hamster|BAM|miniature giant space hamster}一样勇敢。",
	"Your talent for magic came to the attention of the Mages of High Sorcery, an organization of spellcasters that studies magic and prevents its misuse. You've trained among the Mages, but whether you'll face the dangerous test required to become a full member of the group remains to be determined. Your passion for studying magic has likely already predisposed you toward one of the organization's three orders: the benevolent Order of the White Robes, the balance-pursuing Order of the Red Robes, or the ruthless Order of the Black Robes.": "你的魔法天赋引起了高阶巫术法师的注意，这是一个研究魔法并防止其滥用的施法者组织。你已经在法师中接受了训练，但你是否会面临成为该组织正式成员所需的危险测试，还有待确定。你对研究魔法的热情很可能已经使你倾向于该组织的三个教团之一：仁慈的白袍教团，追求平衡的红袍教团，或无情的黑袍教团。"
