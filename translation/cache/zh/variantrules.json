	"The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's location, and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action—knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it—by making a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check contested by the smaller creature's Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.": "较小的生物可以在较大的生物的空间内移动，将该空间视为困难地形。大型生物攻击小型生物的能力取决于小型生物的位置，并由你决定。较大的生物可以通过对较小的生物的力量（{@skill Athletics}）进行检查，并通过对较小的生物的力量（{@skill Athletics}）或灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）进行检查，将较小的生物赶走作为一个动作--将它推开，将它刮到墙上，或抓住并扔出去。较小的生物可以选择使用哪种能力。",
	"The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.": "如果目标用两只或更多的手拿着该物品，则攻击者在其攻击卷中处于劣势。如果目标比攻击者大，它的能力检查就有优势，如果它小，就有劣势。",
	"This option makes it easier for melee combatants to harry each other with opportunity attacks.": "这个选项使近战战斗人员更容易用机会攻击来骚扰对方。",
	"When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also mark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn, any opportunity attack it makes against the marked target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn't expend the attacker's reaction, but the attacker can't make the attack if anything, such as the {@condition incapacitated} condition or the {@spell shocking grasp} spell, is preventing it from taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one opportunity attack per turn.": "当一个生物进行近战攻击时，它也可以标记其目标。直到攻击者的下一回合结束，它对被标记的目标所做的任何机会攻击都有优势。机会攻击不会消耗攻击者的反应，但是如果有什么东西，例如{@condition incapacitated}条件或{@spell shocking grasp}咒语，阻止它做出反应的话，攻击者就不能做出攻击。攻击者每回合只能进行一次机会攻击。",
	"A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check contested by the hostile creature's Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. If the tumbler wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.": "一个生物可以尝试翻滚通过一个敌对生物的空间，躲避和穿梭过对手。作为一个行动或额外行动，翻滚者做一个灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）检查，与敌对生物的灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）检查竞争。如果翻滚者赢得比赛，它可以在本回合内通过敌对生物的空间移动一次。",

	"You can spend an action point whenever you roll a {@dice d20} to make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw. You don't have to decide until after you make the roll and learn if it succeeded or failed. If you spend an action point, roll a {@dice d6} and add it to your {@dice d20} result, possibly changing a failure into a success. You can spend only 1 action point per roll.": "每当你掷出{@dice d20}来进行攻击卷、能力检查或蓄力时，你可以花费一个行动点。你不需要决定，直到你做完卷子，知道它是成功还是失败。如果你花了一个行动点，就可以掷出一个{@dice d6}并把它加到你的{@dice d20}结果中，可能会把失败变成成功。你每次滚动只能花费1个行动点。",

Whenever an {@item adamantine weapon|xge} or piece of {@item adamantine ammunition|xge|ammunition} hits an object, the hit is a critical hit.": "由金刚砂制成或涂有金刚砂的近战武器和弹药在用于击碎物体时异常有效。每当{@item adamantine weapon|xge}或{@item adamantine ammunition|xge|ammunition}的碎片击中一个物体时，该命中是一个关键命中。",
	"The adamantine version of a melee weapon or of ten pieces of ammunition costs 500 gp more than the normal version, whether the weapon or ammunition is made of the metal or coated with it.": "一件近战武器或十件弹药的金刚砂版本比普通版本多花费500金币，无论武器或弹药是由金属制成还是涂有金属。",
	"When adventurers find a piece of technology that isn't from their world or time period, the players might understand what the object is, but the characters rarely will. To simulate a character's ignorance about the technology, have the character make a series of Intelligence checks to figure it out.": "当冒险者发现一件不是他们的世界或时间段的技术时，玩家可能会明白这个东西是什么，但角色很少会明白。为了模拟角色对技术的无知，可以让角色进行一系列的智力检查来弄清它。",
	"To determine how the technology works, a character must succeed on a number of Intelligence checks based on the complexity of the item: two successes for a simple item (such as a cigarette lighter, calculator, or revolver) and four successes for a complex item (such as a computer, chainsaw, or hovercraft). Then consult the Figuring Out Alien Technology table. Consider making the item break if a character fails four or more times before taking a long rest.": "为了确定技术是如何运作的，角色必须根据物品的复杂程度进行智力检查：简单的物品（如打火机、计算器或左轮手枪）需要2次成功，复杂的物品（如电脑、电锯或气垫船）需要4次成功。然后参考《弄清外星人技术》表。如果一个角色在长时间休息之前失败了四次或更多次，可以考虑使该物品失效。",
	"A character who has seen an item used or has operated a similar item has advantage on Intelligence checks made to figure out its use.": "见过某项物品的使用或操作过类似物品的人物在智力检查上有优势，可以弄清其用途。",

	"The character can increase one ability score by 2 or increase two ability scores by 1 each. The ability score can now be increased above 20, up to a maximum of 30.": "角色可以将一个能力分值增加2，或将两个能力分值各增加1。现在，能力得分可以增加到20分以上，最高可增加到30分。",
	"The character gains a new feat chosen by the player, but subject to your approval.": "角色获得一个新的特技，由玩家选择，但须经你批准。",
	"Sometimes the randomness of a {@dice d20} roll leads to ludicrous results. Let's say a door requires a DC 15 Strength check to batter down. A fighter with Strength 20 might helplessly flail against the door due to bad die rolls. Meanwhile, the rogue with a 10 Strength rolls a natural 20 on her first check and knocks the door from its hinges.": "有时，{@dice d20}卷的随机性导致了可笑的结果。比方说，一扇门需要用DC15的力量检查来击倒。一个力量为20的战士可能会因为糟糕的掷骰子而无助地拍打着门。同时，力量为10的无赖在她的第一次检定中掷出自然的20，将门从铰链上敲下来。",
	"If such results bother you, allow automatic success on checks for characters with high ability scores. Under this optional rule, a character automatically succeeds on any ability check with a DC less than or equal to the relevant ability score minus 5. So in the above example, the fighter would automatically kick in the door. This rule doesn't apply to contests, saving throws, or attack rolls.": "如果这样的结果让你感到困扰，那就允许能力分数高的角色在检查中自动成功。在这个可选的规则下，一个角色在任何能力检查中都会自动成功，其DC值小于或等于相关能力得分减去5。所以在上面的例子中，战士会自动踢门。这条规则并不适用于竞赛、蓄力或攻击卷。",
	"The downside of this approach is its predictability. Once a character's ability score reaches 20, checks of DC 15 and lower using that ability become automatic successes. Smart players will then always try to match the character with the highest ability score against any given check. If you want some risk of failure, you need to set higher DCs. Doing this, though, can merely aggravate the problem you're trying to solve: higher DCs require higher die rolls, and thus rely even more on luck.": "这种方法的缺点是其可预测性。一旦一个角色的能力得分达到20，使用该能力的DC15及以下的检查就会自动成功。聪明的玩家将总是试图让能力得分最高的角色来对付任何特定的检查。如果你想要一些失败的风险，你需要设置更高的DC。不过，这样做只会加剧你想解决的问题：更高的DC需要更高的掷骰子，因此更依赖运气。",
	"You can modify this rule to account for proficiencies using an additional option. If a character can apply a proficiency bonus to the check, he or she automatically succeeds if its DC is less than or equal to the relevant ability score. If you don't mind predictability, and you can resist the temptation to increase DCs, you might find that this variant speeds up play and focuses attention on truly difficult, tense situations.": "你可以用一个额外的选项来修改这个规则，以考虑到熟练程度。如果一个角色可以在检定中应用熟练度奖励，那么如果检定的DC小于或等于相关的能力分数，他或她就自动成功。如果你不介意可预测性，而且你能抵制增加DC的诱惑，你可能会发现这种变体能加快游戏速度，并将注意力集中在真正困难、紧张的情况上。",
	"If your player characters regularly fight hordes of lower-level monsters, consider using this optional rule to help speed up such fights.": "如果你的玩家角色经常与成群结队的低级怪物战斗，可以考虑使用这个可选规则来帮助加快这种战斗。",
	"When a melee attack reduces an undamaged creature to 0 hit points, any excess damage from that attack might carry over to another creature nearby. The attacker targets another creature within reach and, if the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining damage to it. If that creature was undamaged and is likewise reduced to 0 hit points, repeat this process, carrying over the remaining damage until there are no valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to reduce an undamaged creature to 0 hit points.": "当一次近战攻击将一个未受伤害的生物减少到0点命中率时，该攻击的任何多余伤害可能会转移到附近的另一个生物。攻击者的目标是触手可及的另一个生物，如果原来的攻击卷能够击中它，则将任何剩余的伤害施加于它。如果该生物没有受到伤害，并且同样被降低到0点命中率，则重复这个过程，将剩余的伤害转嫁到它身上，直到没有有效的目标，或者直到转嫁的伤害不能将一个没有受到伤害的生物降低到0点命中率。",
	"Common is the language of the Five Nations. The Mror dwarves speak Dwarvish and the Aereni elves speak Elvish, but they know Common as the language of trade. In Eberron, there are a number of other languages that serve this role in different regions or cultures. The DM may change the languages assigned to a monster or NPC to reflect this.": "通用语是五国的语言。摩尔矮人说矮人语，艾瑞尼精灵说精灵语，但他们知道通用语是贸易语言。在Eberron，还有一些其他的语言在不同的地区或文化中起着这种作用。DM可以改变分配给怪物或NPC的语言来反映这一点。",
	"Giant is the common tongue of Xen'drik. It is rarely encountered on Khorvaire. Monsters in Khorvaire usually speak Goblin.": "巨人是Xen'drik的通用语言。在Khorvaire很少遇到。Khorvaire的怪物通常说哥布林语。",
	"Goblin is the common tongue of Darguun, Droaam, and the Shadow Marches, along with most \"monstrous\" creatures in Khorvaire. It was the language of the goblin empire that dominated the continent before humanity arrived. Orcish is a dead language; it may be encountered in ancient inscriptions, but modern orcs speak Goblin.": "妖精是达尔古恩（Darguun）、德拉姆（Droaam）和影子牧场（Shadow Marches）的通用语言，以及霍尔韦尔的大多数 \"畸形 \"生物。在人类到来之前，它是统治该大陆的地精帝国的语言。兽人语是一种死亡的语言；它可能在古代的铭文中遇到，但现代兽人说的是哥布林语。",
	"Infernal is spoken by spirits that embody evil. This incorporates Abyssal; all fiends speak a common language. Infernal is sometimes called \"Khyber's speech,\" while Celestial is \"the tongue of Siberys.\"": "无间道是由体现邪恶的精神所讲的。这包含了深渊语；所有的恶魔都说一种共同的语言。无间道有时被称为 \"开伯尔的语言\"，而天道则是 \"西伯利亚人的语言\"。",

	"If a ship moves into the space occupied by a creature or object, it might crash. A ship avoids crashing if the creature or object is at least two sizes smaller than it.": "如果一艘船移动到一个生物或物体所占据的空间，它可能会坠毁。如果生物或物体至少比它小两个尺寸，飞船就能避免坠毁。",
	"When a ship crashes, it must immediately make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage to its hull based on the size of the creature or object it crashed into, as shown on the Crash Damage table. It also stops moving if the object or creature is bigger than it or one size smaller. Otherwise the ship continues moving and the creature or object moves to the nearest unoccupied space that is not in the ship's path. At the DM's discretion, an object that is forced to move but is fixed in place is instead destroyed": "当一艘船坠毁时，它必须立即进行DC 10宪法救赎。如果救赎失败，它的船体就会受到基于它所撞上的生物或物体大小的伤害，如碰撞伤害表所示。如果物体或生物比它大或小一号，它也会停止移动。否则，飞船会继续移动，而生物或物体则会移动到最近的、不在飞船路径上的未被占据的空间。根据DM的决定，一个被迫移动但固定在原地的物体反而会被摧毁。",
	"A creature struck must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + the ship's Strength modifier, taking damage based on the ship's size (as shown on the Crash Damage table) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "被击中的生物必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作，DC等于10+飞船的力量修饰，蓄力失败时受到基于飞船尺寸的伤害（如碰撞伤害表所示），蓄力成功时受到一半的伤害。",

	"House Cannith has an enclave devoted solely to wand production. This facility is equipped with tools that amplify the Mark of Making and channel planar energies; the artisans also have access to a vast array of exotic woods and materials. You can also create a wand, but you're starting from scratch and creating the tools you need. Essentially, when House Cannith creates magic items, it's using factories; while your artificer is the equivalent of the tinkerer working in the garage.

Here's an overview of the process.": "坎尼斯家族有一块专门用于制作魔杖的飞地。这个设施配备了可以放大 \"制造标记 \"和引导平面能量的工具；工匠们还可以获得大量的奇异木材和材料。你也可以创造一根魔杖，但你要从头开始，创造你需要的工具。从本质上说，当坎尼斯家族创造魔法物品时，它是在使用工厂；而你的工匠则相当于在车库里工作的修理工。你可以创造魔法物品，你也有可能创造坎尼斯家族无法制造的物品......但你需要花费比他们更多的时间和金币。下面是这个过程的概述。",

	"This ability to develop a schema represents remarkable talent. It could take House Cannith years or decades to develop a particular schema; the fact that you can accomplish this in weeks reflects the idea that player characters are innovators. However, it is always up to the DM to decide if you can create a particular schema. The DM can always choose to exclude a particular magic item from a campaign.": "这种开发模式的能力代表了非凡的才能。坎尼斯家族可能需要花费数年或数十年的时间来开发一个特定的模式；你可以在数周内完成这一任务，这反映了玩家角色是创新者的想法。然而，你是否能够创造一个特定的模式，总是由DM来决定的。DM总是可以选择将某个特定的魔法物品排除在活动之外。",
	"Any magic item requires specialized materials—Eberron dragonshards, rare woods or metals, exotic herbs or other substances. While exotic, these things can be purchased or obtained in any major city. But creating a magic item from scratch often requires rarer components that can't simply be purchased. You might need a flower from Thelanis, a feather from a couatl, or the scale of a dragon. More often than not, such this will require an adventure. You may not have to kill something to obtain what you need, but you'll surely have to overcome a challenge. The Magic Item Ingredients table suggests how difficult that challenge could be.": "任何魔法物品都需要专门的材料--艾伯伦龙石、稀有木材或金属、异国草药或其他物质。虽然很奇特，但这些东西可以在任何大城市购买或获得。但是从头开始创造一个魔法物品往往需要更稀有的部件，而这些部件是无法简单购买的。你可能需要一朵来自Thelanis的花，一根来自couatl的羽毛，或者一个龙的鳞片。更多时候，这样的事情需要冒险。你可能不需要杀死什么东西来获得你需要的东西，但你肯定要克服一个挑战。魔法物品成分表显示了这种挑战的难度。",
	"Once you have your schema and any rare components, you're ready to begin. The DM can assign skills or tools that are required for this act of creation, so that it requires both proficiency and access to these tools.

It works as a sorting mechanism, providing a big-picture assessment of which creatures, factions, and NPCs make natural allies or enemies.": "结盟是对角色和怪物的一般态度的一个方便的标签。它是一种分类机制，为哪些生物、派别和NPC是天然的盟友或敌人提供了一种大局观的评估。",
	"The standard alignment system embraces the fundamental points of tension in D&D: the struggle between good and evil on the one hand, and the conflict between law and chaos on the other. The nice thing about this arrangement is that it allows for tension even within a good-aligned party. The law—chaos divide means that characters can still disagree on how to promote good in the world.": "标准排列系统包含了D&D中的基本紧张点：一方面是善与恶的斗争，另一方面是法律与混乱的冲突。这种安排的好处是，它甚至允许在善的一方内部出现紧张。法律与混乱的分界线意味着角色们仍然可以在如何促进世界上的善上产生分歧。",
	"Alignment is meant to serve only as a quick summary of a character, not a rigid definition. It's a starting point, but elements such as flaws and bonds paint a much more detailed picture of a character's identity.": "结盟的目的只是作为一个角色的快速总结，而不是一个僵硬的定义。它是一个起点，但诸如缺陷和纽带等元素会对一个角色的身份进行更详细的描述。",
	"You might find that the alignment choices of good and evil, law and chaos are too abstract for your campaign. You might prefer attitudes that are more nuanced, without the implicit demarcation of heroes as good-aligned creatures and villains as evil-aligned ones. A simple solution is to discard alignment in favor of an alternative system that brings the key conflicts in your campaign to the forefront.": "你可能会发现，善与恶、法律与混乱的结盟选择对你的活动来说太抽象了。你可能更喜欢更细微的态度，没有隐含的英雄是善的，反派是恶的的划分。一个简单的解决方案是放弃结盟，而采用另一种系统，将你的战役中的关键冲突带到最前面。",

What are the key conflicts, and how do all the separate conflicts interact?": "通过提出以下问题，思考你的运动中的重要对立力量。你能把它们放在一个连续体的两端吗？是否存在多种冲突？关键的冲突是什么，所有独立的冲突是如何相互作用的？",
	"For your own alignment system, try to create at least two paths, one of which allows a range of options for the player characters. The other paths can divide the world between the characters (including their allies) and their enemies.": "对于你自己的排列组合系统，试着创建至少两条路径，其中一条允许玩家角色有一系列的选择。另一条道路可以将世界划分为角色（包括他们的盟友）和敌人。",
	"For example, imagine a campaign setting where an ecological crisis engineered by a cabal of necromancers threatens to transform the world into a dead wasteland. Forming one alignment path are the opposing forces of life and death. Like the choice of good or evil, this conflict defines the setting, and you would expect most player characters to be aligned to life or at least neutral with respect to their support for the necromancers' plans.": "例如，想象一下这样一个战役背景：一个死灵法师集团设计的生态危机威胁到将世界变成一片死亡的荒地。形成一个排列组合的路径是生命和死亡的对立力量。就像善或恶的选择一样，这种冲突定义了这个环境，你会期望大多数玩家角色与生命结盟，或者至少在支持死灵法师的计划方面保持中立。",
	"The second conflict path might be preservation versus destruction. People who have gathered to protect the land might disagree on whether to attack and destroy the necromancers, or to work instead at strengthening the natural order so that not even the necromancers' power can overwhelm it.": "第二条冲突路径可能是保护与破坏。聚集在一起保护土地的人们可能会在是否攻击和摧毁死灵法师上产生分歧，或者转而努力加强自然秩序，以便连死灵法师的力量都无法压倒它。",
	"For grittier games that avoid obvious classifications of good versus bad, you might create alignment paths with more than two choices. In a game that focuses on intrigue and power struggles, for example, alignment might be a quick reference for which factions a character supports. One element of a character's alignment might indicate his or her affiliation with a noble house or guild. A second element could call out which deity or pantheon the character is tied to.": "对于那些避免明显的好与坏分类的比较狡猾的游戏，你可以创建有两个以上选择的结盟路径。例如，在一个专注于阴谋和权力斗争的游戏中，结盟可能是一个角色支持哪个派系的快速参考。一个角色的排列组合的一个元素可能表明他或她与某个贵族家族或公会的关系。第二个元素可以指出该角色与哪个神灵或万神殿有联系。",
	"When creating your alignment system, think about the role of neutrality, and decide whether there's a midpoint for any alignment path. Neutral creatures might choose to sit out a struggle (as is often the case in good versus evil) or see strengths in both approaches (as in law versus chaos). The role of this choice in your campaign should make sense in terms of your central conflict.": "在创建你的对准系统时，考虑中立的作用，并决定是否有一个任何对准路径的中点。中立的生物可能会选择置身于一场斗争之外（正如善与恶的斗争中经常出现的情况），或者看到两种方法的优势（如法律与混乱）。这种选择在你的活动中的作用应该在你的中心冲突方面有意义。",
	"At your Dungeon Master's option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores. The method described here allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.": "在你的地下城主的选择下，你可以使用这个变体来决定你的能力分数。这里描述的方法允许你用一套你单独选择的能力分数来建立一个角色。",
	"You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying racial increases. You can't have a score lower than 8.": "你有27点可以花在你的能力分数上。每个分数的花费都显示在能力得分点花费表中。例如，一个14分的分数需要7分。使用这种方法，15分是你在应用种族增加之前可以得到的最高能力分数。你不能有一个低于8分的分数。",
	"This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers between those extremes.": "这种确定能力分数的方法使你能够创建一组三个高的数字和三个低的数字（15，15，15，8，8，8），一组高于平均水平且几乎相等的数字（13，13，13，12，12，12），或者在这些极端之间的任何一组数字。",
	"Alternatively, see the ": "另外，请看",
	"At 1st level, you choose various aspects of your character, including ability scores, race, class, and background. Together these elements help paint a picture of your character's origin and give you the ability to create many different types of characters. Despite that versatility, a D&D race that has the Ability Score Increase trait includes little or no choice—a lack that can make it difficult to realize certain character concepts. The following subsections address that lack by adding choice to your character's race if it includes the Ability Score Increase trait, allowing you to customize your ability scores, languages, and certain proficiencies to fit the origin you have in mind for your character. Character race in the game represents your character's fantasy species, combined with certain cultural assumptions. The following options step outside those assumptions to pave the way for truly unique characters.": "在1级时，你可以选择你的角色的各个方面，包括能力分数、种族、等级和背景。这些元素共同帮助描绘了你的角色的起源，并使你有能力创造许多不同类型的角色。尽管有这种多功能性，但具有能力分数增加特性的D&D种族几乎没有任何选择--这种缺乏会使你难以实现某些角色概念。下面的小节解决了这一问题，如果你的种族包括能力分值增加的特性，你就可以在你的种族中增加选择，允许你定制你的能力分值、语言和某些能力，以适应你对角色的想法。游戏中的角色种族代表你的角色的幻想物种，与某些文化假设相结合。以下选项跳出了这些假设，为真正独特的角色铺平了道路。",
	"The Ability Score Increase trait in a race reflects an archetypal bit of excellence in the adventurers of this kind in D&D's past. For example, if you're a dwarf, your Constitution increases by 2, because dwarf heroes in D&D are often exceptionally tough. This increase doesn't apply to every dwarf, just to dwarf adventurers, and it exists to reinforce an archetype. That reinforcement is appropriate if you want to lean into the archetype, but it's unhelpful if your character doesn't conform to the archetype.": "一个种族的能力值增加特质反映了D&D过去这类冒险家的一个典型的优秀点。例如，如果你是一个矮人，你的体质会增加2，因为D&D中的矮人英雄往往是非常强悍的。这种增加并不适用于每个矮人，只适用于矮人冒险者，它的存在是为了加强一种原型。如果你想向原型靠拢，这种强化是合适的，但如果你的角色不符合原型，它就没有帮助了。",
	"If you'd like your character to follow their own path, you may ignore your Ability Score Increase trait and assign ability score increases tailored to your character. Here's how to do it: take any ability score increase you gain in your race or subrace and apply it to an ability score of your choice. If you gain more than one increase, you can't apply those increases to the same ability score, and you can't increase a score above 20.": "如果你想让你的角色走自己的路，你可以忽略你的能力分值增加特性，为你的角色量身定做能力分值增加。具体做法是：将你在你的种族或次种族中获得的任何能力分值增加，应用于你选择的能力分值。如果你获得了一个以上的提高，你不能将这些提高应用于同一个能力分数上，而且你不能将一个分数提高到20以上。",
	"For example, if the Ability Score Increase trait of your race or subrace increases your Constitution by 2 and your Wisdom by 1, you could instead increase your Intelligence by 2 and your Charisma by 1.": "例如，如果你的种族或亚种的能力得分增加特性使你的体质增加2，智慧增加1，你可以改为使你的智力增加2，魅力增加1。",

	"A rival's action might be a direct attack, such as an assassination attempt, that you play out during a session. Or it might be a background activity that you describe as altering the campaign in some way. For example, a rival who wants to increase the prestige of the temple of a war god might hold a festival with drink, food, and gladiatorial games. Even if the characters aren't directly involved, the event becomes the talk of the town.": "竞争对手的行动可能是一个直接的攻击，例如暗杀企图，你在会议期间进行。它也可能是一个背景活动，你把它描述为以某种方式改变战役。例如，一个想要提高战神庙宇威望的对手可能会举办一个有饮料、食物和角斗士游戏的节日。即使人物没有直接参与，这个活动也会成为全镇的话题。",

	"Downtime activities are tasks that usually take a workweek (5 days) or longer to perform. These tasks can include buying or creating magic items, pulling off crimes, and working at a job.

	"The days of an activity don't need to be consecutive; you can spread them over a longer period of time than is required for the activity.

The consequences of a complication might spawn entire adventures, introduce NPCs to vex the party, or give the characters headaches or advantages in any number of other ways.": "每项活动的描述都包括对你可以向角色抛出的复杂情况的讨论。复杂情况的后果可能会引发整个冒险，引入NPC来困扰当事人，或者以任何其他方式让角色感到头痛或有利。",

	"Even before Emrakul's arrival, some cultists and those who pried too deep into dark secrets begin to change. In this early stage, physical proportions shift, with one or more of the creature's limbs or some part of the face growing larger, almost always asymmetrically. Noticeable skin blemishes can also appear, most often as boils or clumps of cauliflower-like growths (though these do not yet resemble the lattice of Emrakul's flesh). Creature statistics are unchanged.": "甚至在埃姆拉库尔到来之前，一些邪教徒和那些窥探黑暗秘密太深的人就开始发生变化。在这个早期阶段，身体比例发生了变化，一个或多个生物的四肢或脸部的某些部分变大，几乎总是不对称的。明显的皮肤瑕疵也会出现，最常见的是疖子或菜花状的生长物（尽管这些还不像埃姆拉库尔的肉格）。生物的统计数据没有变化。",
	"In the second stage, a creature can develop a dead or bulging eye, huge tumorous growths, curled hands or feet, violent palsy, oozing secretions from the skin or eyes, raw red patches on the skin, and similar deformities. Patches of lattice-like growths often appear on the skin. In some cases, particularly in Nephalia, cultists begin to manifest distinctly fishlike features—goggling eyes, scaled or slimy skin, webbing between the fingers or toes, or gill-like flaps on the face or neck. Creature statistics remain unchanged.": "在第二阶段，生物可以出现死眼或凸出的眼睛，巨大的肿瘤性生长，手或脚卷曲，剧烈麻痹，皮肤或眼睛有渗出的分泌物，皮肤上有生的红色斑块，以及类似的畸形。皮肤上经常出现成片的格子状生长。在某些情况下，特别是在尼法利亚，邪教徒开始表现出明显的鱼形特征--眼睛瞪得大大的，皮肤上有鳞片或黏糊糊的，手指或脚趾间有蹼，或脸上或脖子上有鳃状的皮瓣。生物的统计数据保持不变。",
	"In the third stage, the lips shrink away from the teeth, which can rot and fall out. Fingers and toes sometimes fuse together or start transforming into tentacles. Bleeding sores erupt on the skin, or bulbous growths can appear under the skin. Cultists in Nephalia often grow finlike protrusions or pincerlike hands. At this stage, creatures might manifest improved natural armor or weapons, or simple benefits such as the Amphibious trait of a {@creature bullywug}, the Blind Senses of a {@creature grimlock}, Chameleon Skin like a {@creature troglodyte}, the Slippery trait of a {@creature kuo-toa}, or the Spider Climb trait of an {@creature ettercap}.": "在第三阶段，嘴唇从牙齿上缩走，牙齿会腐烂和脱落。手指和脚趾有时会融合在一起，或开始转变为触角。皮肤上会出现出血的溃疡，或者在皮肤下出现球状的生长物。尼法利亚的崇拜者经常长出鳍状突起或钳状手。在这个阶段，生物可能会表现出改进的天然盔甲或武器，或简单的好处，如{@creature bullywug}的两栖特性，{@creature grimlock}的盲觉，{@creature troglodyte}的变色龙皮肤，{@creature kuo-toa}的滑溜特性，或{@creature ettercap}的蜘蛛攀爬特性。",
	"The most warped creatures are barely even recognizable. Some become little more than a mass of writhing tentacles, or lose their physical coherence entirely. Two or more creatures can fuse together, joined by fleshy lattice. The \"lucky\" ones retain a basically humanoid shape, but otherwise appear completely monstrous, with twisted faces, extra limbs, horny growths, jointed tentacle extrusions, and so on. Such a creature might effectively become an Eldrazilike monster such as an {@creature aboleth}, a {@creature chuul}, a {@creature cloaker}, a {@creature gibbering mouther}, or a {@creature mind flayer}.": "最扭曲的生物甚至几乎无法辨认。有的变成了一团蠕动的触手，或者完全失去了身体的连贯性。两个或更多的生物可以融合在一起，由肉质晶格连接。那些 \"幸运 \"的生物基本上保留了人形，但在其他方面则显得完全畸形，有扭曲的面孔、多余的肢体、角质的生长、有关节的触手挤压，等等。这样的生物可能有效地成为Eldrazilike怪物，如{@creature aboleth}、{@creature chuul}、{@creature cloaker}、{@creature gibbering mouther}、或{@creature mind flayer}。",

	"If you want the precision of knowing which way a creature is facing, consider using this optional rule. Whenever a creature ends its move, it can change its facing. Each creature has a front arc (the direction it faces), left and right side arcs, and a rear arc. A creature can also change its facing as a reaction when any other creature moves.": "如果你想要精确地知道一个生物所面对的方向，可以考虑使用这个可选规则。每当一个生物结束其移动时，它都可以改变其朝向。每个生物都有一个前弧（它所面对的方向）、左和右的侧弧以及一个后弧。当任何其他生物移动时，一个生物也可以作为反应而改变其方向。",
	"A creature can normally target only creatures in its front or side arcs. It can't see into its rear arc. This means an attacker in the creature's rear arc makes attack rolls against it with advantage.": "一个生物通常只能针对其前弧或侧弧的生物。它不能看到它的后弧。这意味着在该生物的后弧中的攻击者对它的攻击卷轴具有优势。",

	"Feel free to determine that not all creatures have every type of arc. For example, an amorphous ochre jelly could treat all of its arcs as front ones, while a hydra might have three front arcs and one rear one. On squares, you pick one side of a creature's space as the direction it is facing. Draw a diagonal line outward from each corner of this side to determine the squares in its front arc. The opposite side of the space determines its rear arc in the same way. The remaining spaces to either side of the creature form its side arcs.": "请自由决定，不是所有的生物都有每种类型的弧。例如，一个无定形的赭石果冻可以把它所有的弧线都当作正面的，而九头蛇可能有三个正面的弧线和一个背面的弧线。在方格上，你选择一个生物空间的一侧作为它的方向。从这一侧的每个角落向外画一条对角线以确定其前弧的方格。空间的另一侧以同样的方式决定其后弧。该生物两侧的其余空间构成其侧弧。",
	"On hexes, determining the front, rear, and side arcs requires more judgment. Pick one side of the creature's space and create a wedge shape expanding out from there for the front arc, and another on the opposite side of the creature for the rear arc. The remaining spaces to either side of the creature are its side arcs.": "在六角星上，确定前面、后面和侧面的弧线需要更多的判断。挑选生物空间的一侧，创造一个楔形，从那里向外扩展，作为前弧，并在生物的另一侧创造一个楔形作为后弧。生物两侧的剩余空间是它的侧弧。",
	"A square or hex might be in more than one arc, depending on how you draw the lines from a creature's space. If more than half of a square or hex lies in one arc, it is in that arc. If it is split exactly down the middle, use this rule: if half of it lies in the front arc, it's in that arc. If half of it is in a side arc and the rear arc, it's in the side arc.": "一个正方形或六边形可能在一个以上的弧中，这取决于你如何从生物的空间中画线。如果一个正方形或六边形的一半以上位于一个弧线内，它就在那个弧线内。如果它被正好从中间分割开来，则使用这个规则：如果它的一半位于前面的弧线上，它就在那个弧线上。如果它的一半在侧弧和后弧中，它就在侧弧中。",
	"Falling from a great height is a significant risk for adventurers and their foes. The rule given in the Player's Handbook is simple: at the end of a fall, you take {@dice 1d6} bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet you fell, to a maximum of {@dice 20d6}. You also land {@condition prone}, unless you somehow avoid taking damage from the fall. Here are two optional rules that expand on that simple rule.": "从高处坠落对于冒险者和他们的敌人来说都是一个重大的风险。玩家手册中给出的规则很简单：在坠落结束时，你每下降10英尺就会受到{@dice 1d6}的重击伤害，最大为{@dice 20d6}。你也会落地（％2％），除非你以某种方式避免受到坠落的伤害。这里有两条可选的规则，对这一简单规则进行了扩展。",
	"The rule for falling assumes that a creature immediately drops the entire distance when it falls. But what if a creature is at a high altitude when it falls, perhaps on the back of a {@creature griffon} or on board an {@item airship}? Realistically, a fall from such a height can take more than a few seconds, extending past the end of the turn when the fall occurred. If you'd like high-altitude falls to be properly time-consuming, use the following optional rule.": "坠落的规则假定一个生物在坠落时立即掉下整个距离。但是，如果一个生物在坠落时处于高空，也许是在{@creature griffon}的背上或在{@item airship}的飞机上呢？现实地讲，从这样的高度坠落可能需要几秒钟以上的时间，延长到坠落发生时的回合结束。如果你想让高空坠落适当地耗费时间，可以使用下面的可选规则。",
	"When you fall from a great height, you instantly descend up to 500 feet. If you're still falling on your next turn, you descend up to 500 feet at the end of that turn. This process continues until the fall ends, either because you hit the ground or the fall is otherwise halted.": "当你从高处坠落时，你会立即下降到500英尺。如果你在下一回合仍在下降，你在该回合结束时最多下降500英尺。这个过程一直持续到坠落结束，要么是因为你落地了，要么是因为坠落被停止了。",

	"Terror takes a toll. The ramifications of frightful experiences might be an instant of instinct-triggering shock or a lasting, traumatic echo. The {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} presents options for {@book fear and horror|DMG|9|Fear and Horror} to help reinforce terrifying themes in play. This section presents an alternative system, exploring reactions personalized to individual characters and offering incentive for players to embrace roleplaying moments of fear. Options exploring fear provide guidance to create frightening moments for a character outside of spells or monster abilities, while rules for stress model the lingering toll such events can take. None of these options are required to create an enjoyable horror roleplaying experience, but they provide ways to measure the effects of characters facing and overcoming their fears.": "恐怖需要付出代价。恐怖经历的后果可能是瞬间的本能触发的震惊，也可能是持久的、创伤性的回响。{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}提出了{@book fear and horror|DMG|9|Fear and Horror}的选项，以帮助在游戏中强化恐怖的主题。本节提出了一个替代系统，探索针对个别角色的个性化反应，并为玩家接受恐惧时刻的角色扮演提供激励。探讨恐惧的选项为在法术或怪物能力之外为角色创造可怕的时刻提供了指导，而关于压力的规则则为此类事件可能带来的挥之不去的伤害提供了模型。这些选项都不是创造愉快的恐怖角色扮演体验的必要条件，但它们提供了衡量角色面对和克服恐惧的效果的方法。",
	"Aside from supernatural sources of dread and monsters who strike terror in their victims, fear is subjective and often quite personal. A battle-hardened warrior and a reclusive scholar might not deal with frightful circumstances in the same way. During character creation, a player can choose up to two Seeds of Fear to represent things their character finds truly frightening. The Seeds of Fear table offers some examples. These can change over time as characters grow, overcome old fears, and discover new uncertainties. Work with players to determine when their Seeds of Fear might change.": "除了超自然的恐惧源和让受害者感到恐惧的怪物之外，恐惧是主观的，而且往往是相当个人的。一个身经百战的战士和一个隐居的学者可能不会以同样的方式处理可怕的环境。在创建角色的过程中，玩家可以选择最多两个 \"恐惧种子 \"来代表他们的角色认为真正可怕的事情。恐惧的种子 \"表提供了一些例子。随着角色的成长，克服旧的恐惧，发现新的不确定因素，这些东西可以随着时间而改变。与玩家一起确定他们的 \"恐惧的种子 \"何时会改变。",

	"The table is only a starting point. You can refer to it when adjudicating any actions a character takes that you think should be faster or slower. Quick, easy actions should grant a bonus, while slow, difficult ones should incur a penalty. As a rule of thumb, apply a bonus or penalty of 2 or 5 for an action.": "该表只是一个起点。你可以在裁决一个角色所采取的任何你认为应该更快或者更慢的行动时参考它。快速、简单的行动应该给予奖励，而缓慢、困难的行动应该招致惩罚。作为一个经验法则，对一个行动适用2或5的奖励或惩罚。",
	"For example, a fighter wants to turn a winch to raise a portcullis. This is a complex, difficult action. You could rule that it incurs a -5 initiative penalty.": "例如，一名战士想转动绞盘来提升舷梯。这是一个复杂、困难的动作。你可以规定它产生一个-5的主动性惩罚。",
	"After deciding on an action, everyone rolls initiative and applies modifiers, keeping the result secret. You then announce an initiative number, starting with 30 and working down (it helps to call out ranges of numbers at the start). Break any ties by having the combatant with the highest Dexterity act first. Otherwise, roll to determine who goes first.": "在决定了一个行动之后，每个人都要掷出主动权，并应用修改器，对结果保密。然后你宣布一个主动权数字，从30开始往下算（一开始就喊出数字范围会有帮助）。打破任何平局，让灵巧度最高的战斗人员先行动。否则，就掷骰子来决定谁先行动。",
	"On its turn, a creature moves as normal but must take the action it selected or take no action at all.": "在它的回合中，生物如常移动，但必须采取它所选择的行动或根本不采取任何行动。",
	"Once everyone has acted, the process repeats. Everyone in the battle selects an action, rolls initiative, and takes turns in order.": "一旦每个人都采取了行动，这个过程就会重复进行。战斗中的每个人都选择一个行动，掷出主动权，并按顺序轮流。",
	"Damage normally leaves no lingering effects. This option introduces the potential for long-term injuries.": "损伤通常不会留下任何后遗症。这个选项引入了长期伤害的可能性。",
	"It's up to you to decide when to check for a lingering injury. A creature might sustain a lingering injury under the following circumstances:": "由你来决定何时检查是否有残余的伤害。在下列情况下，一个生物可能会受到持续的伤害。",
	"When it takes a critical hit": "当它受到严重打击时",
	"When it drops to 0 hit points but isn't killed outright": "当它的命中率下降到0但没有被彻底杀死时",
	"When it fails a death saving throw by 5 or more": "当它的死亡拯救动作失败5次或以上时",
	"To determine the nature of the injury, roll on the Lingering Injuries table. This table assumes a typical humanoid physiology, but you can adapt the results for creatures with different body types.": "要确定伤势的性质，请在 \"伤痕累累 \"表上滚动。这张表假设了一个典型的人形生物的生理结构，但你可以为不同体型的生物调整结果。",
	"{@bold Lose an Arm or a Hand.} You can no longer hold anything with two hands, and you can hold only a single object at a time. Magic such as the {@spell regenerate} spell can restore the lost appendage.": "{@bold Lose an Arm or a Hand.}你不能再用两只手握住任何东西，而且你一次只能握住一个物体。诸如{@spell regenerate}法术等魔法可以恢复失去的附属物。",
	"{@bold Internal Injury.} Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you lose your action and can't use reactions until the start of your next turn. The injury heals if you receive magical healing or if you spend ten days doing nothing but resting.": "{@bold Internal Injury.} 每当你试图在战斗中采取行动时，你必须做一个DC15的体质救赎动作。如果救赎失败，你将失去你的行动，并且在你下一回合开始前不能使用反应。如果你接受了魔法治疗，或者你花了十天时间除了休息什么都不做，那么你的伤就会痊愈。",
	"{@bold Broken Ribs.} This has the same effect as Internal Injury above, except that the save DC is 10.": "{@bold Broken Ribs.}这和上面的内伤有相同的效果，只是救治DC是10。",
	"{@bold Minor Scar.} The scar doesn't have any adverse effect. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as {@spell heal} and {@spell regenerate}, removes the scar.": "{@bold Minor Scar.} 疤痕没有任何不良影响。六级以上的魔法治疗，如{@spell heal}和{@spell regenerate}，可以去除疤痕。",
	"Instead of using the effect described in the table, you can put the responsibility of representing a character's lingering injury in the hands of the player. Roll on the Lingering Injuries table as usual, but instead of suffering the effect described for that result, that character gains a new flaw with the same name. It's up to the player to express the lingering injury during play, just like any other flaw, with the potential to gain inspiration when the injury affects the character in a meaningful way.": "你可以不使用表中描述的效果，而是把表现一个角色的挥之不去的伤害的责任放在玩家的手中。像往常一样在缠绵伤害表上掷骰子，但该角色不是遭受该结果所描述的效果，而是获得一个具有相同名称的新缺陷。在游戏过程中，由玩家来表达挥之不去的伤痛，就像其他缺陷一样，当伤痛以一种有意义的方式影响到角色时，有可能获得灵感。",
	"Awarding inspiration is an effective way to encourage roleplaying and risk-taking. As explained in the Player's Handbook, having inspiration gives a character an obvious benefit: being able to gain advantage on one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Remember that a character can have no more than one inspiration at a time.": "奖励灵感是鼓励角色扮演和冒险的一种有效方式。正如《玩家手册》中所解释的，拥有灵感会给角色带来一个明显的好处：能够在一个能力检查、攻击卷或救赎动作上获得优势。请记住，一个角色在同一时间不能有超过一个灵感。",
	"Think of inspiration as a spice that you can use to enhance your campaign. Some DMs forgo using inspiration, while others embrace it as a key part of the game. If you take away anything from this section, remember this golden rule: inspiration should make the game more enjoyable for everyone. Award inspiration when players take actions that make the game more exciting, amusing, or memorable.": "将灵感视为一种香料，你可以用它来加强你的活动。有些DM放弃了使用灵感，而另一些DM则把它作为游戏的一个关键部分。如果你从本节中得到了什么，请记住这条黄金法则：灵感应该使游戏对每个人来说都更加愉快。当玩家采取的行动使游戏更刺激、更有趣或更令人难忘时，就奖励灵感。",
	"As a rule of thumb, aim to award inspiration to each character about once per session of play. Over time, you might want to award inspiration more or less often, at a rate that works best for your table. You might use the same rate for your entire DMing career, or you might change it with each campaign.": "作为一个经验法则，目标是在每节游戏中向每个角色授予灵感一次。随着时间的推移，你可能想或多或少地给予灵感，以最适合你的桌子的速度。你可以在你的整个管理生涯中使用相同的比率，或者你可以在每次活动中改变它。",
	"Offering inspiration as a reward encourages certain types of behavior in your players. Think of your style as a DM and your group's preferences. What helps make the game more fun for your group? What type of action fit in with your campaign's style or genre? Your answer to those questions help determine when you award inspiration.": "提供灵感作为奖励会鼓励你的玩家的某些类型的行为。想想你作为DM的风格和你的小组的喜好。什么有助于使游戏对你的小组更有趣？什么类型的行动符合你的活动风格或流派？你对这些问题的回答有助于决定你何时授予灵感。",
	"Using inspiration to reward roleplaying is a good place to start for most groups. Reward a player with inspiration when that player causes his or her character to do something that is consistent with the character's personality trait, flaw, or bond. The character's action should be notable in some way. It might drive the story forward, push the adventurers into danger, or make everyone at the table laugh. In essence. you reward the player for roleplaying in a way that makes the game more enjoyable for everyone else.": "对于大多数团体来说，使用灵感来奖励角色扮演是一个好的开始。当一个玩家使他或她的角色做了与该角色的个性特征、缺陷或纽带相一致的事情时，就用灵感来奖励该玩家。角色的行动应该在某些方面值得注意。它可能会推动故事的发展，把冒险者推入危险之中，或者让桌子上的每个人都笑起来。从本质上讲，你奖励玩家的角色扮演，使游戏对其他人来说更加愉快。",
	"Take into account each player's roleplaying style, and try not to favor one style over another. For example, Allison might be comfortable speaking in an accent and adopting her character's mannerisms, but Paul feels self-conscious when trying to act and prefers to describe his character's attitude and actions. Neither style is better than the other. Inspiration encourages players to take part and make a good effort, and awarding it fairly makes the game better for everyone.": "考虑到每个玩家的角色扮演风格，尽量不要偏向于一种风格。例如，Allison可能很喜欢用口音说话，并采用她的角色的举止，但Paul在尝试表演时感到很自觉，更喜欢描述他的角色的态度和行动。两种风格都不比对方好。灵感鼓励玩家参与并做出良好的努力，公平地授予它使游戏对每个人都更好。",
	"You can use inspiration to encourage player characters to take risks. A fighter might not normally hurl himself over a balcony to land in the mid of a pack of hungry ghouls, but you can reward the character's daring maneuver with inspiration. Such a reward tells the players that you want them to embrace swashbuckling action.": "你可以用灵感来鼓励玩家角色去冒险。一个战士通常不会把自己扔到阳台上，落在一群饥饿的食尸鬼中间，但你可以用灵感来奖励这个角色的大胆举动。这样的奖励告诉玩家，你想让他们去接受挥霍的行动。",
	"This approach is great for campaigns that emphasize action-packed heroics. For such campaigns, consider allowing inspiration to be spent after a {@dice d20} roll, rather than before. This approach turns inspiration into a cushion against failure—and a guarantee that it comes into play only when a player is faced directly by failure. Such an assurance makes risky tactics less daunting.": "这种方法很适合强调行动英雄主义的活动。对于这样的战役，可以考虑让灵感在掷出{@dice d20}之后，而不是之前花费。这种方法将灵感变成对失败的缓冲--保证它只在玩家直接面临失败时才发挥作用。这样的保证使冒险的战术不那么令人生畏。",
	"Some DMs prefer to play an impartial role in their campaigns. Inspiration normally requires a DM's judgment to award, which might run against your style if you like a campaign where you let dice determine most outcomes. If that's your style, consider using inspiration as a reward when the characters achieve an important goal or victory, representing a surge of confidence and energy.": "有些DM喜欢在他们的活动中扮演公正的角色。灵感通常需要DM的判断来授予，如果你喜欢让骰子决定大多数结果的战役，这可能会违背你的风格。如果这是你的风格，可以考虑在角色实现重要目标或取得胜利时使用灵感作为奖励，代表一种信心和能量的激增。",
	"Under this model, give everyone in the party inspiration if the characters manage to defeat a powerful foe, execute a cunning plan to achieve a goal, or otherwise overcome a daunting obstacle in the campaign.": "在这种模式下，如果人物成功地击败了一个强大的敌人，执行了一个狡猾的计划来实现一个目标，或以其他方式克服了运动中的一个艰巨的障碍，就给党内的每个人以灵感。",
	"Inspiration is a handy tool for reinforcing the conventions of a particular genre. Under this approach, think of the motifs of a genre as personality traits, flaws, and bonds that can apply to any of the adventurers. For example, in a campaign inspired by film noir, characters could have an additional flaw: \"I can 't resist helping a person I find alluring despite warnings that he or she is nothing but trouble.\" If the characters agree to help a suspicious but seductive noble and thereby become entangled in a web of intrigue and betrayal, reward them with inspiration.": "灵感是一个方便的工具，可以强化某一特定流派的惯例。在这种方法下，把一个流派的主题看作是可以适用于任何冒险者的个性特征、缺陷和纽带。例如，在一个以黑色电影为灵感的活动中，人物可以有一个额外的缺陷：\"我无法抗拒帮助一个我觉得很诱人的人，尽管有警告说他或她只是个麻烦。\" 如果人物同意帮助一个可疑但有诱惑力的贵族，并因此卷入了一个阴谋和背叛的网络，就用灵感来奖励他们。",
	"Similarly, characters in a horror story typically can't help but spend a night in a haunted house to learn its secrets. They probably also go off alone when they shouldn't. If the party splits up, consider giving each character inspiration.": "同样，恐怖故事中的人物通常会情不自禁地在闹鬼的房子里过夜，了解它的秘密。他们可能也会在不应该去的时候独自离开。如果聚会分头进行，考虑给每个角色以灵感。",
	"A sensible person would avoid the noble's intrigues and the haunted house, but in film noir or horror, we're not dealing with sensible people; we're dealing with protagonists in a particular type of story. For this approach to work, create a list of your genre's main conventions and share it with your players. Before the campaign begins, talk about the list to make sure your group is on board for embracing those conventions.": "一个明智的人会避开贵族的阴谋和鬼屋，但在黑色电影或恐怖片中，我们面对的不是明智的人；我们面对的是一个特殊类型故事中的主角。为了使这种方法奏效，请创建一个你的流派的主要惯例的清单，并与你的玩家分享它。在活动开始前，讨论这个清单，以确保你的小组同意接受这些惯例。",
	"Remember that a player with inspiration can award it to another player. Some groups even like to treat inspiration as a group resource, deciding collectively when to spend it on a roll. It's best to let players award their inspiration as they see fit, but feel free to talk to them about following certain guidelines, particularly if you're trying to reinforce conventions of a certain genre.": "记住，拥有灵感的玩家可以把它授予另一个玩家。有些团体甚至喜欢把灵感当作一种团体资源，集体决定什么时候把它用在卷轴上。最好的办法是让玩家按照他们认为合适的方式授予他们的灵感，但可以随时与他们讨论如何遵循某些准则，特别是如果你试图加强某种类型的惯例。",
	"Consider the timing of your inspiration rewards. Some DMs like to award inspiration in response to an action. Other DMs like to encourage specific actions by offering inspiration while a player is considering options. Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses.": "考虑你的灵感奖励的时机。有些管理人喜欢在行动后奖励灵感。其他管理员则喜欢在玩家考虑选项时提供灵感，以鼓励特定的行动。这两种方法都有其优势和劣势。",
	"Waiting until after an action preserves the flow of play, but it also means players don't know whether their decisions will earn them inspiration. It also means the player can't spend the inspiration on the act that earned it, unless you allow a player to retroactively spend it or are quick enough to award it before any rolls. This approach works best for groups that want to focus on immersion and player agency, where the DM steps back and gives the players more freedom to do what they want.": "等到行动之后再进行，可以保留游戏的流程，但这也意味着玩家不知道他们的决定是否会给他们带来灵感。这也意味着玩家不能在赢得灵感的行为上花费灵感，除非你允许玩家追溯花费灵感，或者在任何掷骰子之前迅速授予灵感。这种方法最适合那些想要关注沉浸感和玩家代理权的团体，在这种情况下，管理员退后一步，给玩家更多的自由来做他们想做的事。",
	"Telling a player that an action will earn inspiration provides clarity, but it can make it feel like you are manipulating the players or making choices for them. Offering inspiration before an action works great with groups that are comfortable with an emphasis on genre emulation and group storytelling, where character freedom isn't as important as weaving a compelling tale together.": "告诉玩家某项行动会获得灵感，可以让玩家明白，但也会让人觉得你在操纵玩家或为他们做选择。在行动之前提供灵感，对于那些喜欢强调流派模仿和集体讲故事的团体来说是很好的，在这些团体中，角色自由并不像编织一个引人注目的故事那样重要。",
	"Start with awarding inspiration after an action, especially for your first campaign or when playing with a new group. That approach is the least disruptive to the flow of play and avoids making the players feel as if you are being manipulative.": "开始时，在一次行动后授予灵感，特别是对于你的第一次战役或与一个新团体一起玩时。这种方法对游戏流程的干扰最小，而且可以避免让玩家觉得你在操纵他们。",
	"Inspiration might not work for your campaign. Some DMs feel it adds a layer of metagame thinking, and others feel that heroism, roleplaying, and other parts of the game are their own rewards that don't need incentives like inspiration.": "灵感可能对你的活动不起作用。有些管理员觉得它增加了一层元游戏的思维，而另一些人则觉得英雄主义、角色扮演和游戏的其他部分是他们自己的奖励，不需要灵感这样的激励。",
	"If you choose to ignore inspiration, you're telling the players that your campaign is one where you let the dice fall where they may. It's a good option for gritty campaigns or ones where the DM focuses on playing an impartial role as a rules arbiter.": "如果你选择忽略灵感，你就是在告诉玩家，你的战役是一个让骰子落在哪里都可以的地方。这是一个很好的选择，适用于粗暴的战役，或者DM专注于扮演一个公正的规则仲裁者的角色。",
	"As a DM, you have a lot to track during the game. Sometimes you can lose track of inspiration and forget to award it. As a variant rule, you can allow the players to handle awarding inspiration entirely. During every session, each player can award inspiration to another player. A player follows whatever guidelines the group has agreed on for awarding inspiration.": "作为一个管理人，你在游戏过程中有很多事情要跟踪。有时你会失去对灵感的追踪，而忘记授予它。作为一个变通规则，你可以让玩家完全处理授予灵感的问题。在每个环节中，每个玩家都可以向另一个玩家授予灵感。玩家遵循小组商定的授予灵感的任何准则。",
	"This approach makes your life easier and also gives players the chance to recognize each other for good play. You still need to make sure that inspiration is being awarded fairly.": "这种方法使你的生活更轻松，也让玩家有机会互相认可对方的良好发挥。你仍然需要确保公平地授予灵感。",
	"This approach works best with groups that are focused on the story. It falls flat if the players merely manipulate it to gain advantage in key situations, without earning inspiration by way of good roleplaying or whatever other criteria the group has established.": "这种方法在专注于故事的小组中效果最好。如果玩家只是在关键情况下操纵它来获得优势，而没有通过良好的角色扮演或小组制定的其他标准来赢得灵感，那么这种方法就会落空。",
	"In this variant, you can allow each player to award inspiration more than once per session. If you do so, the first time that a player awards inspiration in a session is free. Whenever that player awards it later in the same session, you gain inspiration that you can spend to give advantage to any foe of the player characters. There's no limit to the number of inspirations you can gain in this way, and unspent inspiration carries over from one session to the next.": "在这个变体中，你可以允许每个棋手在每一节中授予灵感一次以上。如果你这样做，一个玩家在一个会话中第一次授予灵感是免费的。每当该玩家在同一会话中授予灵感时，你就会获得灵感，你可以用它来给玩家角色的任何敌人带来好处。你可以通过这种方式获得的灵感数量没有限制，而且未使用的灵感可以从一个会话延续到下一个会话。",
	"Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that's true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.": "灵感是地下城管理员可以用来奖励你以真实的方式来扮演你的角色，这符合他或她的个性特征、理想、纽带和缺陷的规则。通过使用灵感，你可以利用你对被压迫者的同情心这一个性特征，使你在与乞丐王子的谈判中取得优势。或者，灵感可以让你调用你的纽带来保卫你的家乡，以突破对你施加的法术的影响。",
	"Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your DM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.": "你的管理员可以选择以各种理由给你灵感。通常情况下，当你发挥你的个性特征，屈服于缺陷或束缚所带来的缺点，以及以其他令人信服的方式描绘你的角色时，DM会授予你灵感。你的管理员会告诉你如何在游戏中获得灵感。",
	"You either have inspiration or you don't—you can't stockpile multiple \"inspirations\" for later use.": "你要么有灵感，要么没有，你不能储存多个 \"灵感 \"供以后使用。",
	"If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.": "如果你有灵感，你可以在做攻击卷、自救动作或能力检查时消耗它。花费你的灵感会使你在该次翻滚中获得优势。",
	"Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.": "此外，如果你有灵感，你可以奖励另一个玩家良好的角色扮演，聪明的思维，或只是在游戏中做了一些令人兴奋的事情。当另一个玩家角色做了一些真正对故事有贡献的有趣的事情时，你可以放弃你的灵感，给那个角色以灵感。",
	"You can do away with experience points entirely and control the rate of character advancement. Advance characters based on how many sessions they play, or when they accomplish significant story goals in the campaign. In either case, you tell the players when their characters gain a level.": "你可以完全摒弃经验值，控制角色的升级速度。根据他们玩了多少次游戏，或者当他们在战役中完成了重要的故事目标时，来提升角色。无论哪种情况，你都要告诉玩家他们的角色什么时候获得一个等级。",
	"This method of level advancement can be particularly helpful if your campaign doesn't include much combat, or includes so much combat that tracking XP becomes tiresome.": "如果你的活动不包括很多战斗，或者包括很多战斗，以至于追踪XP变得令人厌烦，那么这种等级提升的方法就会特别有帮助。",
	"A good rate of session-based advancement is to have characters reach 2nd level after the first session of play, 3rd level after another session, and 4th level after two more sessions. Then spend two or three sessions for each subsequent level. This rate mirrors the standard rate of advancement, assuming sessions are about four hours long.": "一个好的基于会话的升级速度是让角色在第一个会话后达到2级，在另一个会话后达到3级，再过两个会话后达到4级。然后再花两到三节课的时间来提升后续等级。这个速度反映了标准的升级速度，假设游戏时间约为四个小时。",
	"When you let the story of the campaign drive advancement, you award levels when adventurers accomplish significant goals in the campaign.": "当你让战役的故事推动进展时，当冒险者在战役中完成重要的目标时，你就会授予等级。",
	"Loyalty is an optional rule you can use to determine how far an NPC party member will go to protect or assist the other members of the party (even those she doesn't particularly like). An NPC party member who is abused or ignored is likely to abandon the party, whereas an NPC who owes a life characters or shares their goals might fight to the death for them. Loyalty can be roleplayed or represented by this rule.": "忠诚是一个可选的规则，你可以用它来决定一个NPC党员会在多大程度上保护或协助党内的其他成员（甚至是那些她并不特别喜欢的人）。一个被虐待或被忽视的NPC党员很可能会放弃党，而一个欠了一个生命人物或与他们有共同目标的NPC可能会为他们战斗到死。忠诚可以通过这个规则进行角色扮演或代表。",
	"An NPC's loyalty is measured on a numerical scale from 0 to 20. The NPC's maximum loyalty score is equal to the highest Charisma score among all adventurers in the party, and its starting loyalty score is half that number. If the highest Charisma score changes—perhaps a character dies or leaves the group-adjust the NPC's loyalty score accordingly.": "一个NPC的忠诚度是以0到20的数值来衡量的。NPC的最大忠诚度得分等于聚会中所有冒险者的最高魅力得分，而它的起始忠诚度得分是这个数字的一半。如果最高的魅力值发生了变化--也许是一个角色死亡或离开了团队--那么就相应地调整NPC的忠诚度得分。",
	"Keep track of an NPC's loyalty score in secret so that the players won't know for sure whether an NPC party member is loyal or disloyal (even if the NPC is currently under a player's control).": "秘密跟踪NPC的忠诚度分数，这样玩家就不会确定某个NPC党员是忠诚还是不忠诚（即使该NPC目前在玩家的控制之下）。",
	"An NPC whose loyalty score drops to 0 is no longer loyal to the party and might part ways with them. A loyalty score can never drop below 0.": "忠诚度分数下降到0的NPC不再对党忠诚，并可能与他们分道扬镳。忠诚度的分数永远不能低于0。",
	"An NPC with a loyalty score of 10 or higher risks life and limb to help fellow party members. If the NPC's loyalty score is between 1 and 10, its loyalty is tenuous. An NPC whose loyalty drops to 0 no longer acts in the party's best interests. The disloyal NPC either leaves the party (attacking characters who attempt to intervene) or works in secret to bring about the party's downfall.": "忠诚度为10分或更高的NPC会冒着生命危险来帮助党内成员。如果NPC的忠诚度分数在1到10之间，它的忠诚度是脆弱的。一个忠诚度下降到0的NPC不再为党的最佳利益而行动。不忠诚的NPC要么离开党派（攻击试图干预的角色），要么秘密地工作，使党派垮台。",
	"In a typical campaign, characters aren't driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.": "在一个典型的战役中，角色不会被他们所面对的恐怖和日复一日的屠杀所逼疯，但有时作为一个冒险家的压力会让人难以承受。如果你的活动有一个强烈的恐怖主题，你可能想用疯狂来强化这个主题，强调冒险者所面临的威胁的异常恐怖的性质。",
	"Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact other plane and symbol, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects in the Player's Handbook. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.": "各种魔法效果可以对原本稳定的心智造成疯狂。某些法术，比如接触其他位面和符号，可以导致疯狂，你可以在这里使用疯狂规则，而不是《玩家手册》中的法术效果。疾病、毒药和平面效应，如精神之风或大闹天宫的呼啸之风，都可以造成疯狂。一些神器也可以破坏使用或适应它们的角色的心理。",
	"Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. If your game includes the Sanity score (see chapter 9, \"Dungeon Master's Workshop\"), a creature makes a Sanity saving throw instead.": "抵抗一个诱发疯狂的效果通常需要一个智慧或魅力的自救动作。如果你的游戏包含理智分数（见第9章，\"地下城主的工作室\"），那么生物就会进行理智自救。",
	"Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness.": "疯狂可以是短期的，长期的，或不确定的。大多数相对平凡的影响会造成短期疯狂，只持续几分钟。更加恐怖的影响或累积的影响会导致长期或无限期的疯狂。",

On a success, the character regains control until he or she rolls another 1.": "{@bold Demonic Possession.}角色被一个恶魔实体附身，直到被{@spell dispel evil and good}或类似的魔法释放。每当被附身的角色在攻击卷、能力检查或自救动作上掷出1时，恶魔就会控制该角色并决定该角色的行为。在被附身的角色的每个回合结束时，他或她可以做一个DC15的魅力拯救动作。如果成功，该角色将重新获得控制权，直到他或她再次掷出1。",

	"A larva is a miserable fiend that retains the facial features of its previous form but has the body of a fat worm.

	"The plane's cruel nature makes it difficult for visitors to help one another.

	"The players roll their characters' attacks as normal, but you don't roll for their opponents. Instead, when a character is targeted by an attack, the player makes a defense roll.": "玩家如常滚动他们角色的攻击，但你不为他们的对手滚动。相反，当一个角色被攻击的时候，玩家要做一个防御卷。",
	"A defense roll has a bonus equal to the character's AC - 10. The DC for the roll equals the attacker's attack bonus + 11.": "防御卷的奖励等于人物的AC-10。卷轴的DC等于攻击者的攻击奖励+11。",
	"On a successful defense roll, the attack misses because it was dodged, absorbed by the character's armor, and so on. If a character fails a defense roll, the attack hits.": "在成功的防御卷中，攻击没有击中，因为它被躲避了，被角色的盔甲吸收了，等等。如果一个角色在防御卷中失败，攻击就会击中。",
	"If the attacker would normally have advantage on the attack roll, you instead apply disadvantage to the defense roll, and vice versa if the attacker would have disadvantage.": "如果攻击者通常在攻击卷上有优势，你反而对防御卷适用劣势，如果攻击者有劣势，反之亦然。",
	"If the defense roll comes up as a 1 on the {@dice d20}, then the attack is a critical hit.

	"Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.": "网格上的每个方格代表5英尺。",
	"Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.": "与其一脚一脚地移动，不如在网格上一格一格地移动。这意味着你以5英尺为单位使用你的速度。如果你把你的速度除以5，转化为方格，这就特别容易。例如，30英尺的速度转化为6个方格的速度。",
	"If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in squares on your character sheet.": "如果你经常使用格子，可以考虑在你的人物表上用方格写上你的速度。",
	"To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left, even if the square is diagonally adjacent to the square you're in. (The rule for diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of smooth play. The Dungeon Master's Guide provides guidance on using a more realistic approach.)": "要进入一个方格，你必须至少有1个方格的移动空间，即使这个方格与你所在的方格是对角线相邻的。(对角线移动的规则为了流畅的游戏而牺牲了现实主义。地下城管理员指南》提供了关于使用更真实的方法的指导。）",
	"If a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.": "如果一个方块需要额外的移动量，就像困难地形方块那样，你必须有足够的移动量来支付进入它的费用。例如，你必须至少有2个方格的移动量才能进入一个困难地形的方格。",
	"Diagonal movement can't cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.": "对角线运动不能越过墙角、大树或其他填补其空间的地形特征。",

	"Plot points allow players to change the course of the campaign, introduce plot complications, alter the world, and even assume the role of the DM. If your first reaction to reading this optional rule is to worry that your players might abuse it, it's probably not for you.": "情节点允许玩家改变战役的进程，引入复杂的情节，改变世界，甚至承担DM的角色。如果你看到这条可选规则的第一反应是担心你的玩家会滥用它，那它可能不适合你。",
	"Each player starts with 1 plot point. During a session, a player can spend that point for one effect. The effect depends on your group's approach to this optional rule. Three options are presented below.": "每个玩家开始时有1个情节点。在一次会议中，玩家可以用这个点来获得一个效果。这个效果取决于你的小组对这个可选规则的处理。下面介绍三种选择。",
	"A player can spend no more than 1 plot point per session. You can increase this limit if you like, especially if you want the players to drive more of the story. Once every player at the table has spent a plot point, they each gain 1 plot point.": "一个玩家每节课可以花费不超过1个情节点。如果你愿意，你可以增加这个限制，特别是如果你想让玩家来推动更多的故事。一旦桌子上的每个玩家都花费了一个情节点，他们就各自获得一个情节点。",
	"A player who spends a plot point gets to add some element to the setting or situation that the group (including you) must accept as true. For example, a player can spend a plot point and state that his or her character has found a secret door, an NPC appears, or a monster turns out to be a long-lost ally polymorphed into a horrid beast.": "花费剧情点的玩家可以在设定或情况中加入一些元素，而团体（包括你）必须接受这些元素为真实。例如，玩家可以花费一个情节点，并说明他或她的角色发现了一个秘密的门，一个NPC出现了，或者一个怪物变成了一个久违的盟友，变成了一个可怕的野兽。",
	"A player who wants to spend a plot point in this way should take a minute to discuss his or her idea with everyone else at the table and get feedback before settling on a plot development.": "想以这种方式花费一个情节点的玩家应该花一分钟时间与桌子上的其他人讨论他或她的想法，并在确定情节发展之前获得反馈。",
	"Whenever a player spends a plot point, the player to his or her right must add a complication to the scene. For example, if the player who spends the plot point decides that her character has found a secret door, the player to the right might state that opening the door triggers a magical trap that teleports the party to another part of the dungeon.": "每当一个玩家花费了一个情节点，他或她右边的玩家就必须为场景增加一个复杂因素。例如，如果花费情节点的玩家决定她的角色发现了一扇秘密的门，那么右边的玩家可能会说，打开这扇门会触发一个神奇的陷阱，将聚会传送到地牢的另一个地方。",
	"With this approach, there is no permanent DM. Everyone makes a character, and one person starts as the DM and runs the game as normal. That person's character becomes an NPC who can tag along with the group or remain on the sidelines, as the group wishes.": "采用这种方法，没有永久性的DM。每个人都做一个角色，然后一个人开始做DM，像平常一样运行游戏。这个人的角色会成为一个NPC，他可以根据小组的意愿，跟随小组一起行动，也可以保持旁观状态。",
	"At any time, a player can spend a plot point to become the DM. That player's character becomes an NPC, and play continues. It's probably not a good idea to swap roles in the middle of combat, but it can happen if your group allows time for the new DM to settle into his or her role and pick up where the previous DM left off.": "在任何时候，一个玩家都可以花费一个情节点来成为DM。该玩家的角色成为NPC，游戏继续。在战斗中交换角色可能不是一个好主意，但如果你的小组允许新的管理员有时间进入他或她的角色，并在前一个管理员离开的地方继续工作，这也是可以发生的。",
	"Using plot points in this way can make for an exciting campaign as each new DM steers the game in unexpected directions. This approach is also a great way for would-be DMs to try running a game in small, controlled doses.": "以这种方式使用情节点，可以使游戏活动更加精彩，因为每个新的管理人都会把游戏引向意想不到的方向。这种方法也是一种很好的方式，可以让未来的DM尝试以小规模、可控的剂量运行游戏。",
	"In a campaign that uses plot points this way, everyone should come to the table with a bit of material prepared or specific encounters in mind. A player who isn't prepared or who doesn't feel like DMing can choose to not spend a plot point that session.": "在以这种方式使用情节点的活动中，每个人都应该带着一点准备好的材料或特定的遭遇来参加会议。没有准备好的玩家或不喜欢做管理的玩家可以选择不在那一节课上花费一个情节点。",
	"For this approach to work, it's a good idea to establish some shared assumptions about the campaign so that DMs aren't duplicating efforts or trampling on each other's plans.": "为了使这种方法奏效，最好是建立一些关于活动的共同假设，这样DM就不会重复工作或践踏对方的计划。",
	"Many of the character concepts that were once prestige classes or paragon paths in earlier editions of D&D are now options available to 1st-level characters. In general, the game's design aims for maximum flexibility, making options available to all characters. As such, prestige classes build on the game's broad range of basic options to represent specialized options and unique training.": "许多曾经是D&D早期版本中的威望等级或准绳路径的角色概念，现在都是一级角色可以选择的。总的来说，游戏的设计旨在实现最大的灵活性，使所有角色都可以选择。因此，威望等级建立在游戏中广泛的基本选项之上，代表了专门的选项和独特的训练。",
	"A prestige class requires a high level of skill before a character can master even its basic elements. Prestige classes might confer lost lore, allow access to an inscrutable form of magic, grant mastery of an exotic fighting style, or be built around the knowledge harbored by a secret society.": "一个声望等级在角色掌握其基本要素之前需要有高水平的技能。声望等级可能会赋予失落的传说，允许使用一种难以捉摸的魔法形式，授予掌握一种异国的战斗风格，或者围绕一个秘密社会所蕴藏的知识而建立。",
	"Mechanically, a prestige class is a character class that requires the same training and focus as any other class. You enter a prestige class by way of the normal multiclassing rules. However, you cannot enter a prestige class until you are at least 3rd level—and many prestige classes have even higher level requirements.": "从机制上讲，威望类是一个角色类别，需要和其他类别一样的训练和关注。你可以通过正常的多类规则进入一个声望类。然而，你至少要在3级时才能进入一个声望等级--许多声望等级甚至有更高的等级要求。",
	"Most prestige classes require characters to complete specific deeds in order to gain access to the class. You cannot advance in a prestige class until its gatekeepers—typically those who harbor the class's lore—agree to accept you.": "大多数声望等级要求角色完成特定的事迹，以获得进入该等级的机会。在一个声望阶级的守门人--通常是那些掌握该阶级传说的人--同意接受你之前，你不能在该阶级中晋升。",
	"A prestige class typically offers access to unique game mechanics available only to members of that class. Such mechanics reflect specific lore, secrets, or techniques impossible to master without earning the respect and trust of those who already possess that knowledge.": "一个声望等级通常提供只有该等级的成员才能使用的独特游戏机制。这种机制反映了特定的传说、秘密或技术，如果不赢得那些已经拥有这些知识的人的尊重和信任，就不可能掌握。",
	"In order to join a prestige class, you must first check with your Dungeon Master. A DM can opt to include or disallow prestige classes in the game. Typically, a prestige class requires you to undertake specific actions in the game so that your character can begin pursuing that class. If those actions aren't already possible in your campaign, talk to your DM about integrating the prestige class that interests you.": "为了加入一个声望等级，你必须先向你的地下城管理员确认。管理员可以选择在游戏中加入或不加入声望等级。通常情况下，一个声望等级要求你在游戏中采取特定的行动，以便你的角色可以开始追求这个等级。如果这些行动在你的活动中还不可能实现，请与你的管理员讨论整合你感兴趣的威望等级。",
	"A prestige class uses the normal D&D multiclassing rules (see chapter 6, \"Customization Options,\" in the Player's Handbook). When your character is ready to advance a level, you can choose to gain a level in a prestige class. Your levels in all your classes, including prestige classes, are added together to determine your character level.": "声望级使用正常的D&D多类规则（见《玩家手册》第6章，\"自定义选项\"）。当你的角色准备提高一个等级时，你可以选择在威望类中获得一个等级。你在所有等级中的等级，包括声望等级，会加在一起决定你的角色等级。",
	"Taking up a prestige class through multiclassing involves meeting certain prerequisites, just as with multiclassing into a standard class. You must meet the ability score prerequisites for your current class and for the prestige class in order to qualify for it.": "通过多类来获得一个声望等级，需要满足一定的先决条件，就像多类进入一个标准等级一样。你必须满足你当前等级和声望等级的能力得分先决条件，才能获得该等级的资格。",
	"A prestige class requires a minimum character level and a minimum score in at least one ability, as well as requiring that you complete a specific deed—finding a magic item, defeating a monster, surviving a particular challenge, and so on—before being able to take up that class.": "一个声望等级需要最低的角色等级和至少一种能力的最低得分，还需要你完成一个特定的行为--找到一个魔法物品、击败一个怪物、在一个特定的挑战中生存下来，等等--然后才能够接受该等级。",
	"Just as with the standard rules for multiclassing, the experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class.": "就像多类的标准规则一样，获得一个等级的经验值成本总是基于你的总角色等级，而不是你在某个特定等级中的等级。",
	"Each prestige class specifies the hit points you gain from it. You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes and prestige classes to determine your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you simply pool them together.": "每个声望等级都规定了你从中获得的打击点数。你将你所有的等级和声望等级所赋予的命中率加在一起，以确定你的命中率。如果这些命中率是同一类型的，你可以简单地把它们集中起来。",
	"Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. A prestige class specifies whether it grants proficiencies when you enter it.": "你的熟练度奖励总是基于你的角色总等级，而不是你在某个特定等级中的等级。一个声望等级在你进入该等级时，会指定它是否授予熟练度。",
	"You gain prestige class features just like normal class features. Sometimes, a prestige class can improve features you have gained from other classes. If a prestige class grants Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, or Unarmored Defense, that feature is treated the same way as if you had gained it from multiple standard classes.": "你获得声望等级的特征就像普通等级的特征一样。有时，一个声望等级可以改善你从其他等级获得的特征。如果一个声望阶级授予了 \"神性通道\"、\"额外攻击 \"或 \"无装甲防御\"，那么该特征的处理方式与你从多个标准阶级获得该特征相同。",
	"Some prestige classes grant spellcasting. Each prestige class provides details on how to determine your overall spellcasting ability, using the rules for spellcasting and multiclass characters.": "有些声望等级会授予法术攻击。每个声望等级都提供了如何确定你的整体法术能力的细节，使用法术和多类角色的规则。",
	"This optional rule replaces a character's proficiency bonus with a proficiency die, adding more randomness to the game and making proficiency a less reliable indicator of mastery. Instead of adding a proficiency bonus to an ability check, an attack roll, or saving throw, the character's player rolls a die. The Proficiency Die table shows which die or dice to roll, as determined by the character's level.": "这条可选的规则用熟练度骰子代替了角色的熟练度奖励，给游戏增加了更多的随机性，使熟练度成为一个不那么可靠的掌握指标。角色的玩家不是在能力检查、攻击卷或蓄力投掷中加入熟练度奖励，而是掷骰子。熟练度骰子表显示了要掷的骰子，这由角色的等级决定。",
	"Whenever a feature, such as the rogue's Expertise, lets a character double his or her proficiency bonus, the player rolls the character's proficiency die twice instead of once.": "每当一个特征，例如流氓的专长，让一个角色的熟练度奖励翻倍时，玩家就会把角色的熟练度模子掷两次而不是一次。",
	"This option is intended for player characters and nonplayer characters who have levels, as opposed to monsters who don't.": "这个选项是为有等级的玩家角色和非玩家角色准备的，而不是为没有等级的怪物。",

For example, members of the Emerald Enclave—a faction dedicated to preserving the natural order—might be less friendly toward characters who have not cultivated at least 3 renown within that organization, becoming friendly by default only when a character has gained 10 renown within the Emerald Enclave.

Consider allowing spellcasters to restore expended spell slots equal to only half their maximum spell slots (rounded down) at the end of a long rest, and to limit spell slots restored to 5th level or lower. Only a full 8-hour rest will allow a spellcaster to restore all spell slots and to regain spell slots of 6th level or higher.": "使用这个系统的施法者可以承受快速消耗法术槽的代价，尤其是在较高的等级。考虑允许施法者在长时间休息结束时恢复已消耗的法术槽，其数量仅相当于其最大法术槽的一半（四舍五入），并将恢复的法术槽限制在5级或以下。只有完整的8小时休息才能让施法者恢复所有的法术槽，并重新获得6级或以上的法术槽。",

It's a good option for campaigns that emphasize intrigue, politics, and interactions among other PCs, and in which combat is rare or something to be avoided rather than rushed into.": "这种方法鼓励角色在地牢之外花时间。对于那些强调阴谋、政治和其他NPC之间互动的活动来说，这是一个很好的选择，在这些活动中，战斗是很少见的，或者是需要避免而不是急于进入的。",

	"A rune found as treasure is a master rune, carefully scribed into a rare object and available for use as a training tool to allow would-be rune scribes to unlock its power. Each rune discussed below is detailed as part of a master rune.": "作为宝物发现的符文是一个主符文，被精心刻画在一个罕见的物体上，可作为训练工具，让未来的符文刻写者解锁其力量。下面讨论的每个符文都作为主符文的一部分进行了详细说明。",
	"Master runes and the runes they contain are treated much like magic items. They are categorized in rarity from rare to legendary, and can be placed in a campaign whenever the DM opts to place treasure. There are no common or uncommon runes.": "主符文和它们所包含的符文被视为与魔法物品一样。它们的稀有程度从稀有到传奇都有分类，而且只要DM选择放置宝物，就可以在活动中放置。没有普通或不普通的符文。",
	"Treat a master rune as a magic item of its equivalent rarity for the purpose of buying and selling in the campaign. Just as with other magic items, the DM will determine whether such items are available to purchase in the campaign and under what conditions.": "为了在活动中购买和出售，将主符文视为同等稀有度的魔法物品。就像其他魔法物品一样，DM将决定这种物品是否可以在活动中购买以及在什么条件下购买。",
	"Runes are identified in a manner similar to magic items. Simply handling a master rune causes a strong sense of its rune's identity to echo in a character's mind. For example, touching a master rune item containing the kalt rune (the rune of cold) might cause you to experience a sudden chill as visions of snow and ice flash through your mind.": "符文的识别方式与魔法物品类似。只要处理一个主符文，就会在人物的脑海中产生对其符文身份的强烈感觉。例如，触摸一个包含卡尔特符文（寒冷的符文）的主符文物品，可能会使你体验到突然的寒意，因为冰雪的景象在你脑海中闪现。",
	"The {@spell identify} spell immediately reveals a master rune's simple properties. You can also learn its simple properties over the course of a short rest while maintaining physical contact with the rune.": "{@spell identify}法术能立即显示出一个主符文的简单属性。在与符文保持物理接触的情况下，你也可以在短暂的休息过程中学习其简单属性。",
	"A rune always requires attunement to use its simple properties. Attuning to a master rune requires you to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it. This can't be the same short rest used to learn the rune's properties. This focus takes the form of carefully and repeatedly copying the rune, whether with ink and parchment or simply scribing it into the dirt. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, you gain an intuitive understanding of how to activate the rune's magical properties.": "一个符文总是需要调和才能使用它的简单属性。适应一个主符文需要你花一个短暂的休息时间，只专注于该物品，同时与它保持身体接触。这不可能是用来学习符文属性的短暂休息。这种专注的形式是仔细和反复地复制符文，无论是用墨水和羊皮纸还是简单地把它刻在土里。如果短暂的休息时间被打断，调和尝试就会失败。否则，在短暂休息结束后，你会对如何激活符文的魔法属性有一个直观的认识。",
	"A master rune can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and all runes count toward your limit of magic items you can attune to. Any attempt to attune to a fourth magic item or rune fails (though a rune scribe's Rune Mastery feature allows attunement to one additional rune). You cannot attune to more than one copy of a rune.": "一个主符文一次只能与一个生物相适应，所有的符文都计入你可以适应的魔法物品的上限。任何试图调整第四个魔法物品或符文的行为都会失败（尽管符文师的符文精通功能允许调整一个额外的符文）。你不能与一个以上的符文副本相适应。",

	"The spell affects a random location within the spell's range.": "该法术影响到法术范围内的一个随机位置。",
	"The spell's effect is contrary to its normal one, but neither harmful nor beneficial. For instance, a fireball might produce an area of harmless cold.": "咒语的效果与它的正常效果相反，但既无害也无益。例如，一个火球可能产生一个无害的寒冷区域。",

	"A shared campaign might use some variant rules to handle certain aspects of the game. The Adventurers League, for instance, has variant systems for gaining levels and acquiring treasure. These \"house rules,\" presented below, serve as a sort of common language, ensuring that the rewards all characters receive are equivalent no matter what kind of adventure a character experienced.": "一个共享活动可能会使用一些变体规则来处理游戏的某些方面。例如，冒险者联盟就有获得等级和获得宝藏的变体系统。下面介绍的这些 \"内部规则 \"可以作为一种共同语言，确保所有角色获得的奖励都是同等的，无论角色经历了什么样的冒险。",
	"In a shared campaign, characters gain levels not by accumulating experience points but by reaching experience checkpoints. This system rewards every character (and player) for taking part in a play session.": "在一个共享的活动中，角色不是通过积累经验值而是通过达到经验检查点来获得等级。这个系统奖励每个参加游戏环节的角色（和玩家）。",
	"A character reaches 1 checkpoint for each hour an adventure is designed to last. Note that the award is based on the adventure's projected playing time, rather than the actual time spent at the table. The reward for completing an adventure designed for 2 hours of play is 2 checkpoints, even if a group spends more than 2 hours playing through it.": "一个冒险每持续一个小时，角色就达到一个检查点。请注意，这个奖励是基于冒险的预计游戏时间，而不是在桌子上花费的实际时间。完成一个设计为2小时游戏的冒险的奖励是2个检查点，即使一个小组花了超过2小时玩完它。",
	"If a character completes an adventure designed for a tier higher than the character's current tier, the character is awarded 1 additional checkpoint. For example, if a 2nd-level character completes a 6th-level adventure designed to take 2 hours, the character reaches 3 checkpoints.": "如果一个角色完成了为高于该角色当前等级设计的冒险，该角色将获得1个额外的检查点。例如，如果一个2级的角色完成了一个设计为2小时的6级冒险，该角色就会达到3个检查点。",
	"Playing time might seem like an odd way to measure experience awards, but the concept is in keeping with how a shared campaign is meant to work. A character played for 10 hours reaches the same number of checkpoints, whether the character went up against a dragon or spent all that time lurking in a pub. This approach ensures that a player's preferred style is neither penalized nor rewarded. Whether someone focuses on roleplaying and social interaction, defeating monsters in combat, or finding clever ways to avoid battles, this system gives credit where credit is due.": "游戏时间可能看起来是衡量经验值的一种奇怪的方式，但这个概念与共享战役的运作方式是一致的。一个角色玩了10个小时，就会达到相同数量的检查点，无论这个角色是去对付一条龙，还是花了所有时间潜伏在酒馆里。这种方法确保玩家的首选风格既不会受到惩罚也不会得到奖励。无论某人专注于角色扮演和社会互动，还是在战斗中击败怪物，或者找到避免战斗的巧妙方法，这个系统都会给予应有的奖励。",
	"The number of checkpoints needed to gain the next level depends on a character's level:": "获得下一等级所需的检查点数量取决于角色的等级。",
	"At levels 1—4, reaching 4 checkpoints is sufficient to advance to the next level.": "在第1-4关，达到4个检查点就可以进入下一关。",
	"At level 5 or higher, reaching 8 checkpoints is needed to advance to the next level.": "在第5级或以上，达到8个检查点才能进入下一级别。",
	"At the end of a play session, characters must level up if they have reached enough checkpoints to do so. The required number of checkpoints is expended, and any remaining checkpoints are applied toward the next opportunity for advancement.": "在一个游戏环节结束时，如果角色已经达到足够的检查点，他们就必须提升等级。所需的检查点数量被消耗掉了，任何剩余的检查点都被用于下一次升级的机会。",
	"In a shared campaign, each character receives a fixed number of gold pieces upon gaining a new level. (This gain represents the treasure a character might find in a standard adventure.)": "在一个共享的活动中，每个角色在获得一个新的等级时都会得到固定数量的金币。(这个收益代表了一个角色在标准冒险中可能找到的宝藏）。",
	"As an additional benefit, characters are not required to put out gold to maintain a lifestyle. Instead, each character begins with a modest lifestyle, which improves as the character attains higher levels.": "作为一个额外的好处，角色不需要拿出黄金来维持生活方式。相反，每个角色开始时都有一个适度的生活方式，随着角色等级的提高而得到改善。",

	"The DMs of the shared campaign should work together to compile a list of magic items that players can purchase. The magic item tables in chapter 2 of this book and in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide are the obvious starting point. Choosing which items to allow or ban is a matter of personal preference, just as it is for the DM in a standard campaign. Involving all the DMs helps to ensure that the list meets everyone's expectations. When in doubt, disallow an item; it's easier to add it to the available items at a later time than it would be to remove it from the game once it has been handed out.": "共享活动的管理人应该共同编制一份玩家可以购买的魔法物品清单。本书第2章和《地下城管理员指南》第7章中的魔法物品表是明显的起点。选择允许或禁止哪些物品是个人偏好的问题，就像标准战役中DM的选择一样。让所有DM参与进来，有助于确保清单满足每个人的期望。如果有疑问，就不允许某种物品；以后再把它添加到可用物品中去，比一旦发放就把它从游戏中删除要容易。",
	"Naturally, the list of available items is longer for adventures in the higher tiers, and the point cost of those higher-tier items likewise increases. The Magic Items by Tier table provides the details.": "当然，对于更高等级的冒险来说，可用物品的清单更长，而这些高等级物品的点数成本也同样增加。按等级划分的魔法物品表提供了详细情况。",
	"For instance, treasure points from a tier 1 adventure can be spent on items from tables A, B, C, and F. Any item on the first three tables costs 4 points, and an item from table F costs 8 points.": "例如，来自一级冒险的宝藏点数可以用于购买A、B、C和F表中的物品，前三个表中的任何物品都需要4点，F表中的物品需要8点。",
	"Players must spend treasure points at the end of a play session, immediately after determining whether their characters have gained a level. The order of these steps is important, since a character might enter a new tier because of the level gain.": "玩家必须在一个游戏环节结束时，在确定他们的角色是否获得了等级后立即花费宝藏点。这些步骤的顺序很重要，因为一个角色可能因为等级的提高而进入一个新的等级。",

	"Many items cost more treasure points than a character can earn in a 2- or 4-hour adventure. To buy such an item, a character can make a deposit, spending treasure points on the item until it's paid off, at which time the character gains the item.": "许多物品的价格比一个角色在2或4小时的冒险中所赚取的宝藏点还要多。为了购买这样的物品，角色可以进行存款，在物品上花费宝藏点数，直到付清为止，这时角色就会获得该物品。",
	"Characters can use their monetary treasure to purchase anything from the equipment lists in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook.

	"A ship requires a number of able-bodied sailors to crew it, as specified in its stat block. A crew's skill, experience, morale, and health are defined by its quality score. A crew starts with a quality score of +4, and that score varies over time, going as low as -10 and as high as +10. It decreases as a crew takes casualties, suffers hardship, or endures poor health. It increases if the crew enjoys high morale, has good health care, and receives clear, fair leadership.": "一艘船需要一定数量的健壮的水手来当船员，这在它的状态块中有规定。船员的技能、经验、士气和健康状况由其质量得分来定义。一个船员开始时的质量得分是+4，这个分数会随着时间的推移而变化，低至-10，高至+10。它随着船员的伤亡、困难或健康状况的恶化而减少。如果船员的士气高涨，有良好的医疗保健，并得到清晰、公平的领导，那么它就会增加。",

	"If you'd like to explore running a ship, it needs officers to oversee its operations—officers who fill six different roles. A person can fill only one role at a time, though multiple people can be assigned to a single role. Some roles aboard a ship reflect the need for trained experts to direct a crew's efforts. Others focus on keeping the crew's health and morale in order.": "如果你想探索经营一艘船，它需要军官来监督它的运作--那些担任六个不同角色的军官。一个人在同一时间只能扮演一个角色，不过一个人可以被分配到一个角色。船上的一些角色反映了对训练有素的专家的需求，以指导船员的工作。其他角色则侧重于保持船员的健康和士气。",

	"The Expertise feature works differently than normal under this rule. At 1st level, instead of choosing two skill proficiencies, a character with the Expertise class feature chooses one of the abilities in which he or she has proficiency. Selecting an ability counts as two of the character's Expertise choices. If the character would gain an additional skill proficiency, that character instead selects another ability check in which to gain proficiency.": "在这个规则下，\"专长 \"的作用与正常情况不同。在1级的时候，拥有 \"专长 \"类特征的角色不是选择两个技能的熟练度，而是选择他或她所熟练的能力中的一个。选择一种能力算作角色的两个专长选择。如果该角色可以获得一个额外的技能熟练度，该角色可以选择另一个能力检查来获得熟练度。",
	"This option removes skills from the game and doesn't allow for much distinction among characters. For example, a character can't choose to emphasize persuasion or intimidation; he or she is equally adept at both.": "这个选项将技能从游戏中移除，并且不允许角色之间有太多的区别。例如，一个角色不能选择强调说服或恐吓；他或她同样擅长这两种。",
	"With this variant rule, characters don't have skill or tool proficiencies. Anything that would grant the character a skill or tool proficiency provides no benefit. Instead, a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check to which the character's prior training and experience (reflected in the character's background) reasonably applies. The DM is the ultimate judge of whether the character's background applies.": "在这个变体规则下，角色没有技能或工具的熟练程度。任何可以赋予角色技能或工具熟练度的东西都不会带来好处。相反，一个角色可以把他或她的熟练度加到任何能力检查上，而该角色先前的训练和经验（反映在该角色的背景中）是合理适用的。DM是判断该角色的背景是否适用的最终法官。",
	"For example, the player of a character with the noble background could reasonably argue that the proficiency bonus should apply to a Charisma check the character makes to secure an audience with the king. The player should be encouraged to explain in specific terms how the character's background applies. Not simply \"I'm a noble,\" but \"I spent three years before starting my adventuring career serving as my family's ambassador to the court, and this sort of thing is second nature to me now.\"": "例如，一个具有贵族背景的角色的玩家可以合理地争辩说，熟练度加分应该适用于该角色为确保与国王会面而进行的魅力检查。应该鼓励玩家用具体的术语来解释该角色的背景是如何应用的。不是简单的 \"我是一个贵族\"，而是 \"在开始我的冒险生涯之前，我花了三年时间担任我的家族在宫廷的大使，这种事情现在对我来说是第二天性了。\"",
	"This simple system relies heavily on players developing their characters' histories. Don't let it result in endless debates about whether a character's proficiency bonus applies in a given situation. Unless a player's attempt to explain the relevance of the character's background makes everyone else at the table roll their eyes at its absurdity, go ahead and reward the player for making the effort.": "这个简单的系统在很大程度上依赖于玩家对其角色历史的发展。不要让它导致无休止地争论一个角色的熟练度奖励是否适用于某个特定的情况。除非玩家试图解释角色背景的相关性，使桌子上的其他人都为其荒谬性而翻白眼，否则就去吧，奖励玩家的努力。",
	"If a character has the Expertise feature, instead of choosing skills and tools to gain the benefit of that feature, the player defines aspects of his or her background to which the benefit applies. Continuing the noble example, the player might decide to apply Expertise to \"situations where courtly manners and etiquette are paramount\" and \"figuring out the secret plots that court members hatch against one another.\"": "如果一个角色有 \"专长 \"的特征，玩家不是选择技能和工具来获得该特征的好处，而是定义他或她的背景中适用该好处的方面。延续贵族的例子，玩家可能决定将专长应用于 \"宫廷礼仪最重要的情况 \"和 \"弄清宫廷成员相互间的秘密阴谋\"。",
	"With this variant rule, characters don't have skill proficiencies. Instead, a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check directly related to the character's positive personality traits. For example, a character with a positive personality trait of \"I never have a plan, but I'm great at making things up as I go along\" might apply the bonus when engaging in some off-the-cuff deception to get out of a tight spot. A player should come up with at least four positive personality traits when creating a character.": "在这个变体规则下，角色没有技能熟练度。相反，一个角色可以把他或她的熟练度加到任何与该角色的积极个性特征直接相关的能力检查上。例如，一个具有 \"我从来没有计划，但我很擅长随心所欲地做事情 \"的积极个性特征的角色，可以在从事一些不经意的欺骗行为以摆脱困境时应用这个奖励。玩家在创造一个角色时，至少要想出四个积极的人格特征。",
	"When a character's negative personality trait directly impacts an ability check, the character has disadvantage on the check. For example, a hermit whose negative trait is \"I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, oblivious to my surroundings\" might have disadvantage on an ability check made to notice creatures sneaking up.": "当一个角色的负面性格特征直接影响到能力检查时，该角色在检查中处于不利地位。例如，如果一个隐士的负面性格是 \"我经常迷失在自己的思想和沉思中，对周围的环境视而不见\"，那么他在察觉生物潜行的能力检查中就会处于不利地位。",
	"If a character has the Expertise feature, the player can apply its benefit to personality traits related to ability checks, instead of to skills or tools. If a character would gain a new skill or tool proficiency, the character instead gains a new positive personality trait.": "如果一个角色有专长特征，玩家可以把它的好处应用到与能力检查相关的人格特征上，而不是技能或工具上。如果一个角色会获得一个新的技能或工具的熟练度，那么这个角色会获得一个新的积极的个性特征。",
	"This system relies heavily on players developing their characters' personalities. Make sure that different characters' traits—positive and negative—come into play with about the same frequency. Don't let a player get away with a positive trait that always seems to apply and a negative trait that never does.": "这个系统在很大程度上依赖于玩家对其角色个性的发展。要确保不同角色的特征--积极的和消极的--发挥作用的频率大致相同。不要让玩家以一种似乎总是适用的积极特征和一种从未适用的消极特征来逃脱。",
	"At your discretion, you can also tie a character's ideals, bonds, and flaws to this system.": "根据你的判断，你也可以把一个角色的理想、纽带和缺陷与这个系统联系起来。",
	"A creature that is naturally sleeping, as opposed to being in a magically or chemically induced sleep, wakes up if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake. A sudden loud noise—such as yelling, thunder, or a ringing bell—also awakens someone that is sleeping naturally.": "一个自然睡眠的生物，而不是处于魔法或化学诱导的睡眠中，如果它受到任何伤害，或者如果其他人使用动作摇晃或拍打该生物，就会醒来。突如其来的巨响--比如大喊大叫、打雷或响铃--也会唤醒自然睡眠的人。",
	"Sleeping in light armor has no adverse effect on the wearer, but sleeping in medium or heavy armor makes it difficult to recover fully during a long rest.": "穿着轻质盔甲睡觉对穿戴者没有不利影响，但穿着中等或重质盔甲睡觉会使人在长时间休息时难以完全恢复。",
	"When you finish a long rest during which you slept in medium or heavy armor, you regain only one quarter of your spent Hit Dice (minimum of one die). If you have any levels of {@condition exhaustion}, the rest doesn't reduce your {@condition exhaustion} level.": "当你完成一个长时间的休息，期间你穿着中型或重型盔甲睡觉，你只恢复四分之一的已用命中率（最小为一个骰子）。如果你有任何{@condition exhaustion}的等级，休息并不会降低你的{@condition exhaustion}等级。",
	"A long rest is never mandatory, but going without sleep does have its consequences. If you want to account for the effects of sleep deprivation on characters and creatures, use these rules.": "长时间的休息从来不是强制性的，但不睡觉确实有其后果。如果你想说明睡眠不足对人物和生物的影响，请使用这些规则。",
	"One way to modify how a class feels is to change how it uses its spells. With this variant system, a character who has the Spellcasting feature uses spell points instead spell slots to fuel spells. Spell points give a caster more flexibility, at the cost of greater complexity.": "修改一个类别的感觉的一种方法是改变它使用法术的方式。在这个变体系统中，拥有咒语功能的角色使用咒语点而不是咒语槽来激发咒语。法术点给施法者带来了更多的灵活性，但代价是更大的复杂性。",
	"In this variant, each spell has a point cost based on its level. The Spell Point Cost table summarizes the cost in spell points of slots from 1st to 9th level. Cantrips don't require slots and therefore don't require spell points.": "在这个变体中，每个法术都有一个基于其等级的点数成本。法术点成本表总结了从1级到9级的插槽的法术点成本。咒语不需要插槽，因此不需要法术点数。",
	"Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast your spells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool of spell points instead. You expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell points total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.": "你不是从 \"施法 \"功能中获得一定数量的法术槽来施展你的法术，而是获得一个法术点的集合。你消耗一定数量的法术点数来创造一个给定等级的法术槽，然后使用该法术槽来施展一个法术。你不能将你的法术点数总数减少到小于0，而且当你完成一次长时休息时，你会重新获得所有消耗的法术点数。",
	"Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. You can use spell points to create one slot of each level of 6th or higher. You can't create another slot of the same level until you finish a long rest.": "6级及以上的法术在施放时特别费力。你可以使用法术点数来创造一个6级或更高等级的槽。在你完成长时间的休息之前，你不能再创造一个相同等级的槽。",
	"The number of spell points you have to spend is based on your level as a spellcaster, as shown in the Spell Points by Level table. Your level also determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so.": "你需要花费的法术点数是基于你作为施法者的等级，如按等级计算的法术点数表所示。你的等级也决定了你可以创建的最大级别的法术槽。即使你可能有足够的点数来创造一个高于这个最大值的槽，你也不能这样做。",
	"This system can be applied to monsters that cast spells using spell slots, but it isn't recommended that you do so. Tracking spell point expenditures for a monster can be a hassle.": "这个系统可以应用于使用法术槽施法的怪物，但不建议你这样做。跟踪怪物的法术点支出会很麻烦。",
	"This section expands on the spellcasting rules presented in the Player's Handbook and the Dungeon Master's Guide, providing clarifications and new options.": "本节对《玩家手册》和《地下城主指南》中的法术规则进行了扩展，提供了澄清和新的选项。",
	"Many spells create obvious effects: explosions of fire, walls of ice, teleportation, and the like. Other spells, such as charm person, display no visible, audible, or otherwise perceptible sign of their effects, and could easily go unnoticed by someone unaffected by them. As noted in the Player's Handbook, you normally don't know that a spell has been cast unless the spell produces a noticeable effect.": "许多法术产生明显的效果：火的爆炸、冰墙、传送等等。其他的法术，比如 \"魅惑\"，没有显示任何可见的、可听的或其他可感知的效果迹象，而且很容易被未受其影响的人注意到。正如《玩家手册》中所指出的，除非法术产生明显的效果，否则你通常不会知道一个法术已经被施放。",
	"But what about the act of casting a spell? Is it possible for someone to perceive that a spell is being cast in their presence? To be perceptible, the casting of a spell must involve a verbal, somatic, or material component. The form of a material component doesn't matter for the purposes of perception, whether it's an object specified in the spell's description, a component pouch, or a spellcasting focus.": "但施法的行为呢？是否有可能让人察觉到有人在他们面前施法？为了能够被感知，施法必须涉及语言、身体或物质的成分。就感知而言，物质成分的形式并不重要，无论它是咒语描述中指定的物体、成分袋，还是施法焦点。",
	"If the need for a spell's components has been removed by a special ability, such as the sorcerer's Subtle Spell feature or the Innate Spellcasting trait possessed by many creatures, the casting of the spell is imperceptible. If an imperceptible casting produces a perceptible effect, it's normally impossible to determine who cast the spell in the absence of other evidence.": "如果对咒语成分的需求已经被一种特殊的能力所消除，例如巫师的微妙咒语特性或许多生物所拥有的先天咒语特性，那么该咒语的施放是不可察觉的。如果不可察觉的施法产生了可察觉的效果，在没有其他证据的情况下，通常无法确定是谁施法。",
	"Sometimes a character wants to identify a spell that someone else is casting or that was already cast. To do so, a character can use their reaction to identify a spell as it's being cast, or they can use an action on their turn to identify a spell by its effect after it is cast.": "有时，一个角色想识别别人正在施放的或已经施放的法术。要做到这一点，角色可以使用他们的反应来识别正在施放的咒语，或者他们可以在他们的回合中使用行动来识别施放后的咒语效果。",
	"If you cast a spell on someone or something that can't be affected by the spell, nothing happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to cast the spell, the slot is still expended. If the spell normally has no effect on a target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even though it didn't attempt one (giving no hint that the creature is in fact an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive that the spell did nothing to the target.": "如果你对不能被法术影响的人或物施法，该目标不会发生任何事情，但如果你用法术槽施法，该法术槽仍然会被消耗掉。如果该法术通常对一个成功施展拯救术的目标没有影响，那么这个无效的目标似乎已经成功施展了拯救术，即使它没有尝试施展（没有提示该生物实际上是一个无效的目标）。否则，你会感觉到这个法术对目标没有任何作用。",
	"The Dungeon Master's Guide includes the following short rule for using areas of effect on a grid.": "地下城管理员指南》包括以下关于在网格上使用效应区的简短规则。",
	"Choose an intersection of squares as the point of origin of an area of effect, then follow the rules for that kind of area as normal (see the \"Areas of Effect\" section in chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook). If an area of effect is circular and covers at least half a square, it affects that square.": "选择一个方块的交叉点作为一个效应区域的原点，然后按照该种区域的正常规则行事（参见《玩家手册》第10章的 \"效应区域 \"部分）。如果一个效应区是圆形的，并且至少覆盖了半个方格，那么它就会影响到那个方格。",
	"That rule works, but it can require a fair amount of on-the-spot adjudication. This section offers two alternatives for determining the exact location of an area: the template method and the token method. Both of these methods assume you're using a grid and miniatures of some sort. Because these methods can yield different results for the number of squares in a given area, it's not recommended that they be combined at the table—choose whichever method you and your players find easier or more intuitive.": "这一规则是有效的，但它可能需要相当多的现场裁决。本节为确定一个区域的确切位置提供了两种选择：模板法和令牌法。这两种方法都假定你使用的是网格和某种类型的微型模型。由于这两种方法对于给定区域内的方格数会产生不同的结果，因此不建议在桌面上将它们结合起来--请选择你和你的棋手认为更容易或更直观的方法。",
	"The template method uses two-dimensional shapes that represent different areas of effect. The aim of the method is to accurately portray the length and width of each area on the grid and to leave little doubt about which creatures are affected by it. You'll need to make these templates or find premade ones.": "模板法使用二维形状，代表不同的影响区域。该方法的目的是准确描绘网格上每个区域的长度和宽度，并对哪些生物受到影响没有什么疑问。你需要制作这些模板或找到预制的模板。",
	"Making a template is simple. Get a piece of paper or card stock, and cut it in the shape of the area of effect you're using. Every 5 feet of the area equals 1 inch of the template's size. For example, the 20-foot-radius sphere of the {@spell fireball} spell, which has a 40-foot diameter, would translate into a circular template with an 8-inch diameter.": "制作一个模板很简单。找一张纸或卡纸，按照你要使用的效果区域的形状剪下来。该区域每5英尺等于模板尺寸的1英寸。例如，{@spell fireball}法术的20英尺半径的球体，其直径为40英尺，将转化为一个8英寸直径的圆形模板。",
	"To use an area-of-effect template, apply it to the grid. If the terrain is flat, you can lay it on the surface; otherwise, hold the template above the surface and take note of which squares it covers or partially covers. If any part of a square is under the template, that square is included in the area of effect. If a creature's miniature is in an affected square, that creature is in the area. Being adjacent to the edge of the template isn't enough for a square to be included in the area of effect; the square must be entirely or partly covered by the template.": "要使用效果区域模板，将其应用于网格。如果地形是平坦的，你可以把它放在表面上；否则，把模板放在表面上，并注意它覆盖或部分覆盖哪些方格。如果一个方格的任何部分在模板之下，该方格就包括在效果区域内。如果一个生物的迷你模型在受影响的方格内，该生物就在该区域内。仅仅与模板的边缘相邻并不足以让一个方块包括在效应区域内；该方块必须完全或部分地被模板所覆盖。",
	"You can also use this method without a grid. If you do so, a creature is included in an area of effect if any part of the miniature's base is overlapped by the template.": "你也可以不使用网格来使用这种方法。如果你这样做，如果一个生物的底座的任何部分被模板所覆盖，该生物就会被包括在一个影响区域内。",
	"When you place a template, follow all the rules in the Player's Handbook for placing the associated area of effect. If an area of effect, such as a cone or a line, originates from a spellcaster, the template should extend out from the caster and be positioned however the caster likes within the bounds of the rules.": "当你放置模板时，要遵循《玩家手册》中关于放置相关效果区域的所有规则。如果一个效果区，比如一个圆锥体或一条线，源自施法者，那么模板应该从施法者那里延伸出去，并在规则的范围内以施法者喜欢的方式定位。",
	"Diagrams 2.1 and 2.2 show the template method in action.": "图2.1和2.2显示了模板方法的作用。",
	"The token method is meant to make areas of effect tactile and fun. To use this method, grab some dice or other tokens, which you're going to use to represent your areas of effect.": "代币法的目的是使效应区具有触觉和乐趣。要使用这种方法，请拿起一些骰子或其他令牌，你要用它们来代表你的效应区。",
	"Rather than faithfully representing the shapes of the different areas of effect, this method gives you a way to create square-edged versions of them on a grid easily, as described in the following subsections.": "这种方法不是忠实地表现不同效果区域的形状，而是给你提供了一种在网格上轻松创建方形边缘版本的方法，如以下各小节所述。",
	"Every 5-foot square of an area of effect becomes a die or other token that you place on the grid. Each token goes inside a square, not at an intersection of lines. If an area's token is in a square, that square is included in the area of effect. It's that simple.": "效应区域的每一个5英尺的方块都会成为你放置在网格上的一个骰子或其他令牌。每个令牌都在一个方格内，而不是在线条的交叉点。如果一个区域的令牌在一个方格内，该方格就包括在效果区域内。就是这么简单。",
	"Diagrams 2.3 through 2.6 show this method in action, using dice as the tokens.": "图2.3至2.6显示了这种方法的作用，使用骰子作为代币。",
	"This method depicts everything using squares, and a circular area of effect becomes square in it, whether the area is a sphere, cylinder, or radius. For instance, the 10-foot radius of flame strike, which has a diameter of 20 feet, is expressed as a square that is 20 feet on a side, as shown in diagram 2.3. Diagram 2.4 shows that area with total cover inside it.": "这种方法用正方形来描绘一切，一个圆形的作用区域在其中变成了正方形，不管这个区域是球体、圆柱体还是半径。例如，火焰打击的10英尺半径，其直径为20英尺，被表示为一个边长为20英尺的正方形，如图2.3所示。图2.4显示了该区域内的总覆盖物。",
	"A cone is represented by rows of tokens on the grid, extending from the cone's point of origin. In the rows, the squares are adjoining side by side or corner to corner, as shown in diagram 2.5. To determine the number of rows a cone contains, divide its length by 5. For example, a 30-foot cone contains six rows.": "一个圆锥体由网格上的一排代币表示，从圆锥体的原点开始延伸。如图2.5所示，在这些行中，方块是并排或角对角相邻的。要确定一个圆锥体所包含的行数，需要用它的长度除以5，例如，一个30英尺的圆锥体包含6行。",
	"Here's how to create the rows. Starting with a square adjacent to the cone's point of origin, place one token. The square can be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to the point of origin. In every row beyond that one, place as many tokens as you placed in the previous row, plus one more token. Place this row's tokens so that their squares each share a side with a square in the previous row. If the cone is orthogonally adjacent to the point of origin, you'll have one more token to place in the row; place it on one end or the other of the row you just created (you don't have to pick the side chosen in diagram 2.5). Keep placing tokens in this way until you've created all of the cone's rows.": "下面是创建行的方法。从与圆锥体原点相邻的一个正方形开始，放置一个令牌。这个方块可以是与原点正交或斜交的。在这之后的每一行中，放置与你在前一行中放置的相同数量的令牌，再加一个令牌。放置这一行的令牌，使它们的方格与前一行的方格共享一条边。如果圆锥体与原点正交，你将会有一个更多的令牌放在这一行中；把它放在你刚刚创建的这一行的一端或另一端（你不必选择图2.5中选择的那一面）。以这种方式继续放置令牌，直到你创建了圆锥体的所有行。",
	"A line can extend from its source orthogonally or diagonally, as shown in diagram 2.6.": "如图2.6所示，一条线可以从其源头正向或斜向延伸。",
	"Some vessels possess extraordinary abilities, whether due to magic or superior artisanship. The upgrades below can replace a ship's existing components or provide a new element to augment a ship's abilities.": "一些船只拥有非凡的能力，无论是由于魔法还是卓越的工匠精神。下面的升级可以取代船只的现有部件，或提供新的元素来增强船只的能力。",
	"Adding an upgrade costs 15,000 gp and requires {@dice 1d4} weeks of work. During that time, the ship must remain in port. If the ship leaves, the work must start over, but you don't need to pay the gold piece cost a second time.": "增加一个升级需要花费15,000金币，需要{@dice 1d4}周的工作。在这段时间内，船必须留在港口。如果船离开了，工作必须重新开始，但你不需要第二次支付金块费用。",
	"Any ship with a hull can gain one of the following upgrades. In some cases, an upgrade also provides a benefit to the ship's other components.": "任何有船体的舰艇都可以获得以下的升级项目之一。在某些情况下，升级也会为飞船的其他部件提供好处。",
	"Each movement upgrade applies to a specific movement type. A component can gain the benefits of one upgrade.": "每个运动升级适用于一个特定的运动类型。一个组件可以获得一个升级的好处。",
	"The following upgrades can apply to any weapon mounted aboard a ship. A component can gain the benefits of one upgrade, or two upgrades if one of the upgrades is {@vehupgrade Arcane Artillery|GoS}.": "以下的升级可以适用于安装在船上的任何武器。一个部件可以获得一个升级的好处，如果其中一个升级是{@vehupgrade Arcane Artillery|GoS}，则可以获得两个升级的好处。",
	"While figureheads are usually purely decorative, they might be magically treated to produce extraordinary effects. A ship can receive one figurehead upgrade.": "虽然人物头像通常是纯粹的装饰品，但它们可能会被神奇地处理以产生非凡的效果。一艘船可以得到一个头像的升级。",
	"The following upgrades don't apply to a specific element of the ship. A ship can use any number of them, but it can gain a specific upgrade only once.": "以下的升级并不适用于飞船的特定元素。一艘船可以使用它们中的任何数量，但它只能获得一次特定的升级。",
	"Terror doesn't come just for the brave and prepared—often quite the opposite. Some of the most harrowing horror stories involve the least likely heroes, individuals who find their simple lives transformed into waking nightmares.": "恐怖并不只降临在勇敢和有准备的人身上--通常情况下恰恰相反。一些最令人痛心的恐怖故事涉及最不可能成为英雄的人，他们发现自己简单的生活变成了清醒的噩梦。",
	"In most horror adventures, your players will employ familiar, adventure-ready characters. That doesn't need to be the case, though. Instead, for short, low-power adventures, immersive retellings of tragic events, out-of-body experiences, or other unique tales, consider providing players with temporary, stand-in characters called survivors.": "在大多数恐怖冒险中，你的玩家将采用熟悉的、可供冒险的角色。不过，情况并不一定是这样。相反，对于短小精悍的冒险、身临其境地重述悲剧事件、灵魂出窍或其他独特的故事，可以考虑为玩家提供临时的、被称为幸存者的替身角色。",
	"This section provides guidance for using survivors, characters designed for one- to three-session adventures focused on survival rather than saving the day. Using survivors helps create horror experiences focused on the dread inherent to having limited resources and facing impending doom without forcing players to risk their favorite characters.": "本节提供了使用幸存者的指导，这些角色是为一到三节的冒险而设计的，重点是生存而不是拯救世界。使用幸存者有助于创造恐怖体验，重点是资源有限和面临迫在眉睫的厄运时固有的恐惧，而不强迫玩家让他们最喜欢的角色冒险。",
	"Survivors are premade characters that are simple and easy for players to master, while being customizable enough to fill broad roles in your adventures—whether they be farmers or bored nobles, constables or babysitters. Adventures employing survivors are meant to be asides within broader campaigns or otherwise short experiences.": "幸存者是预制的角色，对玩家来说简单而容易掌握，同时可以定制，足以在你的冒险中扮演广泛的角色--无论他们是农民还是无聊的贵族，警员还是保姆。采用幸存者的冒险是为了在更广泛的战役中作为旁观者，或者作为短暂的经历。",
	"Use survivors to provide information to players in the form of a self-contained adventure. Even if it doesn't make sense for a campaign's characters to be present for an event, survivors can provide players with perspectives they wouldn't otherwise have. For example, you might use survivors in the following ways:": "利用幸存者以自成一体的冒险形式向玩家提供信息。即使活动中的人物出现在某一事件中没有意义，幸存者也可以为玩家提供他们无法获得的观点。例如，你可以通过以下方式使用幸存者。",
	"Survivors serve as the first constables on the scene during a serial killer's crime. Afterward, when the players' other characters get involved in the investigations, the players know the details.": "在连环杀手的犯罪过程中，幸存者作为第一个到达现场的警员。之后，当玩家的其他角色参与调查时，玩家就会知道详细情况。",
	"Survivors provide players front row seats to important historic events. It's one thing to hear about the massacre at Castle Ravenloft following Strahd von Zarovich's transformation into a vampire, but it's another to play it.": "幸存者》为玩家提供了重要历史事件的前排座位。听说斯特拉赫特-冯-扎罗维奇变成吸血鬼后在雷文洛夫特城堡发生的大屠杀是一回事，但扮演它是另一回事。",
	"The Mists frequently kidnap characters from across the multiverse, dragging them into the Domains of Dread. They don't always claim their victims bodily, though. Rather, the Mists might steal characters' minds, placing them into survivors involved in specific terrifying scenarios. Perhaps characters suddenly find themselves mentally recast into someone defending against a zombie siege in Falkovnia, attending a ball in Dementlieu, or exploring the tombs of Har'Akir (see {@book chapter 3|VRGR|3} for details on such adventures). Whether the characters survive or meet spectacular ends doesn't matter, as death might mean a return to the character's original body, a second chance to try again, or a stranger fate.": "迷雾经常从整个多元宇宙绑架人物，把他们拖入恐惧之域。不过，他们并不总是要求受害者的身体。相反，迷雾可能会窃取人物的思想，将他们置于参与特定恐怖场景的幸存者中。也许人物突然发现自己在精神上变成了在法尔科夫尼亚抵御僵尸围攻的人，参加Dementlieu的舞会，或者探索Har'Akir的墓穴（关于此类冒险的详情，请参见{@book chapter 3|VRGR|3}）。角色是否存活或遭遇壮观的结局并不重要，因为死亡可能意味着回到角色原来的身体，有再次尝试的机会，或者有更奇怪的命运。",
	"Make sure your players know how long you plan to use survivors and that they'll be playing their usual characters again soon. Also let them know that survivors are designed to engage with terrifying circumstances, but their triumph over such threats is not assured. Players' decisions will certainly impact the survivors' fates, but if it seems like doom is in store, encourage the players to embrace it and make sure their survivors meet unforgettable ends.": "要确保你的玩家知道你计划使用幸存者多久，而且他们很快就会再次扮演他们的常用角色。还要让他们知道，幸存者的设计是为了应对可怕的环境，但他们对这种威胁的胜利并不确定。玩家的决定肯定会影响到幸存者的命运，但如果看起来厄运将至，鼓励玩家接受它，并确保他们的幸存者遇到难忘的结局。",
	"Dwindling resources contribute to terrifying situations. When a group runs out of hit points, spells, food, or other vital reserves, tension and dread increase. High-level characters, though, have such resources in spades.

For example, you must have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.": "如果一个方块需要额外的移动量，就像{@quickref difficult terrain||3}的方块那样，你必须有足够的移动量来支付进入它的费用。例如，你必须有至少两格的移动量才能进入{@quickref difficult terrain||3}的方格。",
	"If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.": "如果你从一个以上的等级获得额外攻击的等级特征，这些特征不会加在一起。你不能用这个特性进行两次以上的攻击，除非它说你可以（就像战士版本的额外攻击一样）。同样地，如果你也有额外攻击，那么术士的长生召唤 \"饥渴之刃 \"也不会给你带来额外的攻击。",
	"Unlike other abilities, Honor can't be raised with normal ability score increases. Instead, you can award increases to Honor—or impose reductions—based on a character's actions. At the end of an adventure, if you think a character's actions in the adventure reflected well or poorly on his or her understanding of the code, you can increase or decrease the character's Honor by 1. As with other ability scores, a character's Honor can't exceed 20 or fall below 1.": "与其他能力不同，\"荣誉 \"不能通过正常的能力分数增加来提高。相反，你可以根据角色的行为给予荣誉的增加，或者施加减少。在冒险结束时，如果你认为一个角色在冒险中的行为很好或很差地反映了他或她对法典的理解，你可以将该角色的荣誉增加或减少1。",
	"For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.": "你每花一天的停工时间，就可以制作一件或多件总市场价值不超过5戈比的物品，你必须消耗价值为总市场价值一半的原材料。如果你想制作的东西的市场价值大于5GP，你每天都会以5GP为单位取得进展，直到你达到该物品的市场价值。例如，一套板甲（市场价值1,500金币）需要300天才能完成。",
	"Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.": "多个角色可以共同制作一件物品，前提是这些角色都能熟练使用必要的工具，并且在同一个地方工作。每个角色在帮助制作物品的过程中，每花一天时间就贡献5戈比的努力。例如，三个具有必要的工具熟练度和适当设施的人物可以在100天内制作一套板甲，总成本为750GP。",
	"While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses).": "在制作过程中，你可以维持适度的生活方式，而不需要每天支付1个金币，或者以正常费用的一半维持舒适的生活方式（关于生活方式费用的更多信息，见第5章）。",
	"You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses). This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.": "你可以在两次冒险之间工作，使你能够维持适度的生活方式，而不必每天支付1个金币（关于生活方式支出的更多信息见第五章）。只要你继续从事你的职业，这个好处就会一直持续下去。",
	"If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves' guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.": "如果你是一个能够提供有报酬的工作的组织的成员，如寺庙或盗贼公会，你的收入反而足以支持一个舒适的生活。",

	"You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.": "你可以利用冒险之间的停工期，从衰弱的伤害、疾病或毒药中恢复。",
	"After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:": "在休养三天后，你可以做一个DC15的宪法救赎动作。拯救成功后，你可以选择以下结果之一。",
	"End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.": "结束你身上一个使你无法恢复命中率的效果。",

	"The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.": "冒险之间的时间是进行研究的好机会，可以深入了解活动过程中出现的神秘事件。研究可以包括在图书馆里翻阅尘封的书本和摇摇欲坠的卷轴，或者请当地人喝酒，从他们嘴里撬出谣言和八卦。",
	"For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses (as discussed in chapter 5).": "每进行一天的研究，你必须花费1戈比以支付你的费用。这笔费用是在你正常的生活方式支出之外的（如第五章所述）。",

	"When a spelljamming ship crashes into something that could reasonably damage it, both the ship and the creature or object it struck take bludgeoning damage based on the size of the struck object, as shown in the Crash Damage table. If the ship runs into something that doesn't have hit points (such as a planet or a moon), apply the damage only to the ship. The ship stops after crashing into a Gargantuan or immovable creature or object; otherwise, the ship can continue moving if it has any movement left, and whatever it struck moves to the nearest unoccupied space that isn't in the ship's path.": "当法术干扰船撞上可以合理伤害它的东西时，船和被撞的生物或物体都会受到基于被撞物体大小的打击伤害，如碰撞伤害表中所示。如果飞船撞上了没有命中点的东西（比如行星或月球），则只对飞船造成伤害。在撞上巨大的或不可移动的生物或物体后，飞船会停下来；否则，如果飞船有剩余的移动力，它可以继续移动，而它所撞到的东西会移动到最近的、不在飞船路径上的无人空间。",
	"The standard crew complement for a spelljamming ship includes one captain to give orders, one spelljammer to pilot the ship, and one or more crew members to operate its weapons. Some ships carry extra crew (such as troops and back-up spelljammers) or passengers. A ship that has more than a standard crew complement will degrade the quality of its air supply more quickly.": "咒语干扰船的标准船员编制包括一名船长负责发号施令，一名咒语干扰者负责驾驶船只，以及一名或多名船员负责操作其武器。有些船会携带额外的船员（如部队和后备咒语干扰者）或乘客。一艘有超过标准船员编制的船会更快地降低其空气供应的质量。",
	"Nonmagical repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 hit point of damage to a berthed ship takes 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials and labor. Damage to shipboard weapons can be repaired just as quickly (1 hit point per day), but at half the cost (10 gp per hit point).": "当船只停泊时，可以对受损船只进行非魔法修复。对停泊的船只进行1点损伤的修复需要1天时间，材料和人工费用为20GP。船上武器的损坏可以同样快地被修复（每天1个命中点），但费用只有一半（每个命中点10金币）。",
	"The {@spell mending} spell is a cheaper, less time-consuming way to make repairs. Casting {@spell mending} on a damaged ship or shipboard weapon restores a number of hit points to the target equal to {@dice 1d8} plus the spellcaster's spellcasting ability modifier. The target can regain hit points from that spell no more than once per hour.": "{@spell mending}法术是一种更便宜、更省时的维修方式。对受损的船只或船上的武器施展{@spell mending}，可以为目标恢复相当于{@dice 1d8}加施法者的法术能力修饰的命中率。目标可以从该法术中恢复击中点，每小时不超过一次。",
	"The following rules are designed to make ship-to-ship combat simple yet exciting.": "下面的规则旨在使船与船之间的战斗变得简单而刺激。",

The shorter the distance, the less time crews have to load weapons and make other preparations.": "在交战开始时，DM决定一艘船离它的敌人有多远。开始交战距离表中提供了三种可能性。距离越短，船员们就越没有时间来装载武器和做其他准备。",

	"Beyond the range of most ranged weapons": "超过大多数远程武器的射程",
	"The {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} presents a variant rule called {@variantrule Initiative Variants||Side Initiative}, which is ideal for ship-to-ship engagements, since it saves you the trouble of tracking initiative for individual creatures aboard each ship.": "{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}提出了一个叫做{@variantrule Initiative Variants||Side Initiative}的变体规则，它是船与船之间交战的理想选择，因为它省去了你追踪每艘船上的各个生物的主动权的麻烦。",
	"A spelljamming ship typically has one or more shipboard weapons, ballistae and mangonels being the most common. Such weapons are slow to load and fire. Player characters are almost always better off using their own weapons and spells in ship-to-ship combat, reserving shipboard weapons for targets that are too far away to be damaged by other means.": "一艘法术干扰船通常有一个或多个舰载武器，其中最常见的是弹道导弹和芒果导弹。这种武器的装填和发射速度都很慢。在船对船的战斗中，玩家角色几乎总是最好使用他们自己的武器和法术，而将船载武器保留给距离太远而无法用其他方式破坏的目标。",
	"On its turn, a ship can be turned and reoriented so that all its weapons can aim and fire at any target within range, regardless of where they're situated on the deck.": "在它的回合中，一艘船可以转向和调整方向，以便它的所有武器可以瞄准和射击范围内的任何目标，无论它们位于甲板上的什么位置。",
	"When one ship moves to within 5 feet of another ship, the spelljammer or pilot of the moving ship can maneuver it alongside the other ship, enabling creatures to move safely from one ship's deck to the other ship's deck until one of the ships pulls away from the other.": "当一艘船移动到另一艘船的5英尺范围内时，移动的船的咒语师或驾驶员可以操纵它与另一艘船并排，使生物能够安全地从一艘船的甲板移动到另一艘船的甲板，直到其中一艘船与另一艘船拉开距离。",
	"A ship that has enough movement can pull alongside another vessel, deploy a boarding party, and then move away, provided the members of the boarding party took the {@action ready||Ready} action to position themselves so they can move onto the other vessel when it's close enough.": "一艘有足够移动能力的船可以停在另一艘船的旁边，部署一支登船队，然后离开，前提是登船队的成员采取了{@action ready||Ready}的行动来定位自己，以便在另一艘船足够近的时候可以移动到它上面。",
	"The {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} presents a simple method for counting movement and measuring range on a grid: count every square as 5 feet, even if you're moving diagonally. Though this is fast in play, it breaks the laws of geometry and is inaccurate over long distances. This optional rule provides more realism, but it requires more effort during combat.": "{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}提出了一个简单的方法来计算移动量和测量网格上的范围：把每一格算作5英尺，即使你是斜向移动。虽然这在游戏中很快速，但它打破了几何定律，而且在长距离上是不准确的。这个可选的规则提供了更多的真实性，但它在战斗中需要更多的努力。",
	"A character who spends at least 10 days performing sacred rites gains {@book inspiration|PHB|4|Inspiration} (described in chapter 4 of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}) at the start of each day for the next {@dice 2d6} days.": "一个花了至少10天时间进行神圣仪式的角色，在接下来的{@dice 2d6}天里，每天开始都会获得{@book inspiration|PHB|4|Inspiration}（在{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}的第四章中描述）。",
	"It's possible for the characters to start a campaign at 1st level, dive into an epic story, and reach 10th level and beyond in a short amount of game time. Although that pace works fine for many campaigns, some DMs prefer a campaign story with pauses built into it—times when adventurers are not going on adventures. The downtime rules given in this section can be used as alternatives to the approach in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB|8|Downtime Activities} and the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|6|Downtime Activities}, or you can use the material here to inspire the creation of your own options.": "角色有可能从1级开始活动，潜入一个史诗般的故事，并在很短的游戏时间内达到10级甚至更高。虽然这种节奏对许多战役来说都很好，但有些管理员更喜欢有停顿的战役故事--冒险者不进行冒险的时候。本节给出的停顿时间规则可以作为{@book Player's Handbook|PHB|8|Downtime Activities}和{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|6|Downtime Activities}中的方法的替代方案，或者你可以使用这里的材料来启发创造你自己的方案。",
	"It's up to you to decide whether a character has proficiency with a firearm. Characters in most D&D worlds wouldn't have such proficiency.

	"When determining initiative, a creature attacking with a weapon rolls initiative dice equal to the damage dice rolled for the weapon. Use the base damage listed in the {@table Weapons|PHB} table in chapter 5 of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, ignoring additional damage granted by spells, magical effects, feats, and so on.": "当决定主动权时，用武器攻击的生物所掷的主动权骰子等于为该武器所掷的伤害骰子。使用{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}第五章的{@table Weapons|PHB}表中所列的基本伤害，忽略法术、魔法效果、功法等赋予的额外伤害。",
	"Awarding inspiration is an effective way to encourage roleplaying and risk-taking. As explained in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, having inspiration gives a character an obvious benefit: being able to gain advantage on one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Remember that a character can have no more than one inspiration at a time.": "奖励灵感是鼓励角色扮演和冒险的一种有效方式。正如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中所解释的，拥有灵感会给角色带来一个明显的好处：能够在一个能力检查、攻击卷或拯救动作上获得优势。请记住，一个角色在同一时间不能有超过一个灵感。",
	"Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as {@spell contact other plane} and {@spell symbol}, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}.

	"A prestige class uses the normal D&D multiclassing rules (see chapter 6, \"{@book Customization Options|PHB|6|Multiclassing},\" in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}).

	"Many spells create obvious effects: explosions of fire, walls of ice, teleportation, and the like. Other spells, such as charm person, display no visible, audible, or otherwise perceptible sign of their effects, and could easily go unnoticed by someone unaffected by them. As noted in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, you normally don't know that a spell has been cast unless the spell produces a noticeable effect.": "许多法术产生明显的效果：火的爆炸、冰墙、传送等等。其他的法术，如魅惑人，没有显示任何可见的、可听的或其他可感知的效果迹象，而且很容易被未受其影响的人所忽视。正如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中所指出的，你通常不知道一个法术已经被施放，除非该法术产生明显的效果。",

	"As a member of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, you scoff at those who limit their intelligence-gathering activities to mere research or sagery.

But it can also expand across a much broader range of activities.

	"The character or staff member overseeing the activity makes an Intelligence check, and can make use of a skill appropriate to the scrutineering activity at the DM's discretion.

	"Certain adventures thrive on the adrenaline of the chase or the ever-present fear of ambush. As it stands, the need to take a {@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short rest} can prove difficult during long dungeon crawls, and this lends itself to a nice tone of personal stress and risk versus reward. However, sometimes a rest is necessary for the party to continue, even if the current rush of the story's clock won't allow for the hour that a {@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short rest} requires.": "在某些冒险中，追逐的肾上腺素飙升或始终存在的伏击恐惧是不可或缺的。就目前情况而言，在长时间的地牢探险中需要休息可能会变得困难，这会给个人压力和风险与回报之间的平衡带来一种不错的氛围。然而，有时团队继续前进需要休息，即使当前故事中的紧迫感不允许进行{@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short rest}所需的一个小时。",
	"One way to make {@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short rests} less intrusive is to let characters take one in a reduced amount of time.

If they have half an hour to spare, let them take a {@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short rest} in 30 minutes.

	"If fudging game mechanics to support the campaign's narrative doesn't feel right for your group, the characters can potentially make use of the option to take an arduous rally instead of a {@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short rest}. This involves one or more characters spending 5 minutes to rally their resolve in the face of coming peril, letting their adrenaline fuel the need to push on. A character who undertakes an arduous rally gains the benefit of a {@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short rest}, but any hit points restored by spending Hit Dice are halved. Moreover, the character gains one level of {@condition exhaustion}.": "如果擅自篡改游戏机制来支持战役叙事对你的团队不合适，角色们可以选择进行艰苦集结而不是{@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short rest}。这包括一个或多个角色花费5分钟来鼓舞他们的决心，面对即将到来的危险，让肾上腺素推动他们继续前进。进行艰苦集结的角色将获得{@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short rest}的好处，但通过消耗生命骰来恢复生命值的量会减半。此外，该角色会获得一个等级的{@condition exhaustion}。",

	"Character death often becomes no more than a minor inconvenience in some campaigns. Once an adventuring party reaches a certain level, the spells available to return fallen comrades from the afterlife—including {@spell revivify}, {@spell raise dead}, and {@spell resurrection}—make death no more than a temporary setback, potentially undermining one of the most significant elements of danger and threat in the campaign story. For players and GMs who wish to elevate the gravity of character death, the optional rules in this section offer three different approaches.": "在一些游戏中，角色死亡往往只是一个小小的不便。一旦冒险队伍达到一定级别，可用于让阵亡同伴重返人间的法术——包括{@spell revivify}、{@spell raise dead}和{@spell resurrection}——使得死亡不过是一个暂时的挫折，潜在地削弱了战役故事中最重要的危险和威胁元素之一。对于希望提升角色死亡严肃性的玩家和GM，本节中的可选规则提供了三种不同的方法。",
	"Like all of the great rites of passage in life, death changes us. Simply returning to the world of the living does not undo that change, nor is it at all simple. Those who have passed beyond the veil are marked by it, even if they manage to find their way back.": "就像生命中所有伟大的成人礼一样，死亡改变了我们。简单地回到活着的世界并不能消除这种改变，也一点都不简单。那些已经超越面纱的人被它标记了，即使他们设法找到回来的路。",
	"This house rule is used in the {@i Critical Role} livestream to increase the emotional stakes of bringing a beloved friend back from the dead. It also adds the ever-increasing threat of losing a friend permanently to the game, even with the aid of miraculous magic.": "这个房规在{@i Critical Role}直播中使用，目的是增加将心爱的朋友从死亡中带回的情感赌注。它还增加了一个不断增长的威胁，即即使借助神奇的魔法，也有可能永久失去一个朋友。",
	"If magic is used to bring a character back from the dead (except for the {@spell revivify} spell; see below), everyone present becomes part of a resurrection ritual. Up to three characters present for the ritual—typically members of the deceased's adventuring party—can contribute to the ritual by attempting to call their ally's spirit back. This could involve delivering a stirring speech, playing a song from their shared childhood, goading a rival back with a display of sword skills, confessing undying love for them, or anything else that the players or the GM consider emotionally stirring.": "如果使用魔法让一个角色从死亡中复活（除了{@spell revivify}法术；见下文），所有在场的人都会成为复活仪式的一部分。最多三名在仪式中的角色——通常是已故冒险者的队友——可以尝试召唤他们盟友的灵魂回归。这可能涉及发表激动人心的演讲、演奏一首童年时共享的歌曲、通过展示剑术技能来激励对手回来、向他们表白永恒的爱，或者任何其他玩家或GM认为感情激动的事情。",
	"Each of the participating characters makes an ability check. A player can tell the GM what kind of check they want to make, but ultimately the GM decides what check is appropriate based on the character's contribution to the ritual. The baseline DC of this check is 15, but the GM can raise or lower the DC (typically anywhere between 10 and 20) if the contribution seems particularly appropriate or particularly insincere.": "每个参与角色都进行一次能力检定。玩家可以告诉(`GM`)他们想要进行何种检定，但最终(`GM`)根据角色对仪式的贡献决定适合的检定。这次检定的基础难度(`DC`)为15，但(`GM`)可以根据贡献的恰当程度或特别虚伪性质将(`DC`)提高或降低（通常在10到20之间）。",
	"For example, praying to a fallen paladin's god for mercy might require a participant to make a {@dc 10} Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check, whereas shouting at a dead friend's corpse to get back up and stop lazing around might require a {@dc 20} Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) check. If the contribution is roleplayed in a particularly touching way, the GM can grant {@quickref Advantage and Disadvantage|PHB|2|0|advantage} on the check—even if the check's DC remains high.": "例如，向一个陨落的圣武士的神祈求怜悯可能需要参与者进行一次 {@dc 10} 智力 ({@skill Religion}) 检定，而对着一个已故朋友的尸体大喊让他起来不要再懒散可能需要进行一次 {@dc 20} 魅力 ({@skill Intimidation}) 检定。如果贡献以一种特别动人的方式进行角色扮演，GM 可以在检定中授予 {@quickref Advantage and Disadvantage|PHB|2|0|advantage} — 即使检定的 DC 保持较高。",
	"After all the characters' contributions are completed, the GM rolls a single, final resurrection check with no modifier. The base DC of this check is 10, but it is modified in three ways:": "在所有角色的贡献完成后，GM进行一次单独的最终复活检定，没有任何调整值。此检定的基础DC为10，但会以三种方式进行调整：",
	"The DC is increased by 1 for every time the character has returned to life before, as the soul's connection to this world is slowly eroded by repeatedly dying and returning.": "每次角色在(())之前复活，DC值就会增加1，因为灵魂与这个世界的联系会因为反复死亡和复活而逐渐消失。",
	"The DC is reduced by 3 for each successful contribution from the other participants in this ritual.": "每位其他参与者成功贡献后，DC值会减少3点。",
	"The DC is increased by 1 for each failed contribution to the ritual.": "每次对仪式的贡献失败，DC就会增加1。",
	"If the resurrection check is successful, the character's soul is returned to their body (if the soul is willing, as usual). If the check fails, the soul does not return—and the character is permanently unable to be raised from the dead.": "如果复活检定成功，角色的灵魂将回到他们的身体中（只要灵魂愿意，如常）。如果检定失败，灵魂不会返回—角色将永久无法复活。",
	"If a character is brought back from the dead by the {@spell true resurrection} or the {@spell wish} spell, or by a god, they instantly return to life without the need for a resurrection ritual. Additionally, if a character has been permanently lost due to a failed resurrection ritual, the GM can allow a casting of {@spell true resurrection} or {@spell wish} to begin a last-chance resurrection ritual—one that can't be repeated if failed.": "如果一个角色被{@spell true resurrection}或{@spell wish}法术或神明复活，他们会立刻回到生命中，无需进行复活仪式。此外，如果一个角色因为复活仪式失败而永久丧失，GM可以允许使用{@spell true resurrection}或{@spell wish}进行最后一次复活仪式—如果失败则不能重复。",
	"If a spell with a casting time of 1 action is used to restore life to a creature (including the {@spell revivify} spell), no one but the caster can participate in the resurrection ritual. The caster makes a quick resurrection check by rolling a {@dice d20} and adding their spellcasting ability modifier, against a DC equal to 10 + 1 for every time the character has returned to life before. On a failure, the character's soul is not lost, but the resurrection fails and increases the DC of any future resurrection checks by 1. Further attempts to bring the character back to life must involve a spell with a casting time longer than 1 action (including {@spell raise dead} or {@spell resurrection}).": "如果一个施法时间为1个行动的法术被用来让一个生物复活（包括{@spell revivify}法术），除了施法者之外，没有人可以参与复活仪式。施法者通过投掷一个{@dice d20}并加上他们的法术属性调整来进行快速复活检定，检定DC为10加上角色之前复活次数的总和。如果失败，角色的灵魂不会丢失，但复活失败并且会增加任何未来复活检定的DC值1点。进一步尝试让角色复活必须涉及施法时间长于1个行动的法术（包括{@spell raise dead}或{@spell resurrection}）。",
	"In games that use this house rule, the process of a character dying and being pulled back into their body becomes a traumatic experience. The magic that pulls the spirit from beyond the dark veil of death takes a toll on that spirit each time, changing a person in unexpected and profound ways.": "在使用这个家规的游戏中，角色死亡并被拉回自己的身体的过程变成了一次创伤性经历。将灵魂从死亡的黑暗面纱之外拉回的魔法每次都会对灵魂产生影响，以意想不到和深远的方式改变一个人。",
	"This rule is best for campaigns with dark and horrific themes. It adds a dose of grim bleakness that might not feel at home in epic and heroic stories. Players and GMs who want to make use of this rule {@book should talk about it beforehand|TDCSR|4|Session Zero}, and if any player says no or doesn't offer enthusiastic support, it's best to not use it. It's also important for GMs to check in with the players whenever this rule comes into play, just to make sure everyone is still having fun with the darker themes.": "这条规则最适合那些具有黑暗和恐怖主题的战役。它增加了一丝阴郁的荒凉感，这种感觉可能在史诗和英雄故事中并不合适。想要使用这条规则的玩家和主持人{@book should talk about it beforehand|TDCSR|4|Session Zero}，如果有任何玩家表示不同意或者没有热情支持，最好不要使用它。当这条规则生效时，主持人也很重要要与玩家们核实一下，以确保每个人在这些更黑暗的主题下仍然能够享受游戏。",
	"When a character is brought back to life by any spell other than {@spell true resurrection}, that character must make a Wisdom {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw} with a DC equal to 22 − the level of the spell used to return the character to life. On a failure, the character's experience of death and the afterlife exacts a heavy toll, determined by rolling on the {@table Harrowing Return|TDCSR} table. The consequence lasts until the GM rules that the character has resolved it. Consequences with no clear resolution last for {@dice 1d10 × 10} days, after which the player decides how their character overcame it. Or, to make a campaign even darker, the players and the GM can agree that these consequences last indefinitely.": "当一个角色被除{@spell true resurrection}之外的任何法术复活时，该角色必须进行一次智力检定{@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw}，DC为22减去用于复活角色的法术等级。如果检定失败，角色对死亡和来世的经历会造成沉重的代价，通过在{@table Harrowing Return|TDCSR}表上进行投掷来确定。这个后果会持续，直到GM裁定角色已经解决了它。没有明确解决方案的后果会持续{@dice 1d10 × 10}天，之后玩家决定他们的角色如何克服它。或者，为了让战役变得更加黑暗，玩家和GM可以同意这些后果会无限期持续。",
	"Alternatively, rather than rolling on the table, a player and a GM can work together to choose a consequence that creates an interesting story for the character. Such a consequence might tie to the character's backstory, the themes of the campaign, or the circumstances under which the character died.": "相反地，与其在表格上掷骰子，玩家和主持人可以共同合作选择一个后果，为角色创造一个有趣的故事。这样的后果可能与角色的背景故事、战役的主题或角色死亡的情况有关。",
	"A {@spell remove curse} spell temporarily suppresses a consequence of being brought back from the dead, but the consequence returns each time the character drops to 0 hit points or finishes a {@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|long rest}, until the consequence is resolved.": "一个{@spell remove curse}法术暂时抑制了死而复生的后果，但每当角色的生命值降至0或完成一个{@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|long rest}时，后果就会重新出现，直到后果被解决。",

	"In a campaign that uses this house rule, whenever a character is restored to life, the process corrodes a fraction of their vitality, slowly consuming the body until it can no longer sustain life. Each time a character is brought back to life by a spell other than {@spell true resurrection}, that character's Constitution score is permanently reduced by 1. This loss can't be restored except by use of a {@spell wish} spell.

	"Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in {@skill Athletics}, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in {@skill Athletics} and ask for a Constitution ({@skill Athletics}) check. So if you're proficient in {@skill Athletics}, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength ({@skill Intimidation}) check, even though {@skill Intimidation} is normally associated with Charisma.": "通常，你在某项技能上的熟练度只适用于特定类型的能力检定。例如，对于{@skill Athletics}的熟练度通常适用于力量检定。然而，在某些情况下，你的熟练度可能合理地适用于不同类型的检定。在这种情况下，DM可能会要求进行一种不寻常的能力和技能组合的检定，或者你可以询问DM是否可以将熟练度应用于不同的检定。例如，如果你需要从近海岛游泳到大陆，你的DM可能会要求进行一次体质检定，以查看你是否有足够的耐力到达那里。在这种情况下，你的DM可能允许你应用你在{@skill Athletics}上的熟练度，并要求进行一次体质({@skill Athletics})检定。因此，如果你在{@skill Athletics}上有熟练度，你会像在力量({@skill Athletics})检定中那样，将你的熟练加值应用于体质检定。同样地，当你的半兽人野蛮人展示原始力量来恐吓敌人时，你的DM可能会要求进行一次力量({@skill Intimidation})检定，即使{@skill Intimidation}通常与魅力相关联。",
