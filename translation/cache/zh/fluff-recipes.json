	"No, it isn't made from orcs—but for orcs. Half-orcs find this delectable snack quite to their taste, as do the goliaths of Eberron and a few game humans and halflings. It is said that a half-orc named Mazmorras was the first to discover this pungent recipe for cured pork strips, which you can practically taste from twenty yards away. Sometimes called \"the Pork of Gruumsh,\" orcs flavor it with black pepper and garlic; a halfling might instead smooth off the edge with some maple syrup. Experienced adventuring parties venturing into orc lands know that dropping a bundle of bacon can throw pursuers off their trail, and orcs have even been known to barter with humans who carry it. For best results, try using Thayan Doomvault Swine Run pork—it has the right potency.": "不，它不是由兽人制作的，而是为兽人制作的。半兽人发现这种美味的小吃很合他们的口味，Eberron的巨人和一些游戏中的人类和半兽人也是如此。据说，一个名叫马兹莫拉斯（Mazmorras）的半兽人是第一个发现这种腌制猪肉条的辛辣配方的人，你几乎可以在20码之外品尝到它。有时被称为 \"格鲁姆什的猪肉\"，兽人用黑胡椒和大蒜调味；而半兽人可能会用一些枫糖浆来抹去边缘。有经验的冒险者在兽人的土地上冒险时知道，扔下一捆培根可以让追兵失去踪迹，而兽人甚至还知道与携带培根的人类进行交换。为了获得最佳效果，请尝试使用塔扬-杜姆瓦特（Tayan Doomvault）的猪跑肉--它有适当的效力。",
	"The Dessarin Valley region of Faerûn offers far more than fertile land and majestic sunsets (and wandering monsters). It's also home to some of the finest cattle farming in all Toril. This succulent, slow-cooked beef chuck roast, inspired by a popular regional recipe that originated with the Oglyntyr family in the village of Amphail, is prepared with cider, pear, and ginger—all of which help to activate the full flavor of the meat. The ginger offers the dish a pleasing warmth and an unexpected nuance, more than an overt gingery flavor, while the fermented hard pear cider provides a touch of residual sweetness, albeit dry and earthy. Don't fret, if you can't track down hard pear cider (sometimes called \"perry\"), then apple will do just fine! Roasted sweet potatoes or winter squash make a savory accompaniment and taste wonderful with a ladle or two of sweet au jus.": "法鲁恩的德萨林山谷地区提供的远不止是肥沃的土地和雄伟的日落（以及游荡的怪物）。它也是整个托里尔最好的养牛场的所在地。这道肉质鲜美的慢火烤牛肉，灵感来自于安普海尔村奥甘特尔家族的一个流行的地区食谱，用苹果酒、梨和生姜烹制，所有这些都有助于激活肉的全部味道。姜为这道菜提供了令人愉悦的温暖和意想不到的细微差别，而不是公开的姜味，而发酵的硬梨苹果酒提供了一丝残留的甜味，尽管是干的和土的。不要着急，如果你找不到硬梨苹果酒（有时称为 \"佩里\"），那么苹果也可以。烤红薯或冬瓜是一种美味的佐料，配上一两勺甜味汁，味道非常好。",

However, this recipe is rumored to be the personal one of Arkhan the Cruel, notorious disciple of the five-headed dragon goddess, Tiamat, and thus worthy of inclusion. You won't catch this ferocious and cunning Oathbreaker Paladin eating anything less than the finest halfling flesh in his chili, but the spices work wonderfully with any meat substitute you choose—in this instance, spicy ground turkey, or abyssal chicken, which is simmered for hours with kidney beans, allspice, cloves, cayenne, and a Vecna's handful of cocoa powder.

These traditional sausages are sheet pan–baked with succulent tomatoes that soak up the juices and practically polymorph into a meat themselves.

They are known for extreme proficiency in combat, but mediocrity (or less) in just about everything else. Although several orc elders live among Minmax people serving as healers, shamans, and storytellers, the clan, led by the fearsome and wise Kalatuur Minmax, has embraced an atypical approach to food and politics. Similarly, their palate ranges greatly, from subtler human fare such as fish, cheese, and bread to the orcish desire for big-game meat.

But even aasimar are half-human, and their need for mortal sustenance is why many believe the bread recipe common in the Twin Paradises is ultimately aasimar in origin. This spiced bread, served in thick slices, is made from grains imbued with grated carrots and rich chunks of almond.

	"Crafted from a secret Evermeet recipe and aged for hundreds of years, a sip of this splendid elven concoction is \"a taste of the higher planes themselves.\" Superlatives aside, in the culinary realm, it is undeniably the beverage by which all others are measured. Smooth and aromatic, this extraordinary elixir blankets the palate with powerful notes of clover honey and a mélange of elven fruits and grains that are so rare they don't even have a name in the common language. Rumored to use ingredients and techniques similar to feywine, this pricey draught is only available on the Isle of Evermeet in the Trackless Sea west of Faerûn or in Aurora's Catalogue by hand keg or bottle.

	"There is a parallel plane to the \"Prime\" (the one that contains all known worlds of the multiverse) known as the Feywild, or the Plane of Faerie, from which sylvan creatures such as pixies, satyrs, unicorns, dryads, and the like originated. It was in this mirror realm, bathed in eternal twilight and ethereal luminescence, that all elven-kind was birthed from swirling, limitless magic, including the eladrin—elves with an unfathomably deep connection to the seasons. These elves, who still call the fey dimension home, boast a highly intuitive link with nature and are able to craft incredible meals with near-perfect combinations of ingredients. One dish, known as Feywild eggs, is a delightful presentation of creamed, herbed, and fluffed eggs, completed over even heat for a golden crisp finish. Some have claimed this simple recipe descended from the leShay, an immortal breed of fey \"elves\" with incredible, godlike powers. Thankfully, you don't need to visit the Feywild to try these eggs.

Some reject their unholy origins outright, but many proudly live in harmony with it, open to exploring all aspects of their unique traits. This open-minded approach has yielded a bold, unfettered diet that is often unapproachable and sometimes dangerous to the uninitiated. One dish they have a knack for is fire-spiced abyssal chicken (a bird-like fiend native to the Abyss and Avernus with a taste similar to fatty chicken), or fire-spiced anything for that matter since their natural resistance to heat has granted them an enhanced ability to handle spice as well.

The arms and legs of the gingerbread man are ringed with icing, but the body is covered in a protective armor of chopped nuts and raisins.

While quaint country cottages connected by narrow footpaths crowd the surface, the true action is in their generous cellars, which can extend as many as three stories below the ground. Linked by tunnels that serve as underground thoroughfares, gnome residents run shoppes, inns, and taprooms out of these cozy, hearth-lit subterranean spaces. It's here you'll find the town's culinary specialty: Hardbuckler stew.

A thick handmade crust and a flaky, buttery top blanket a tart and tasty rose apple (nearly any apple suffices, season pending, of course) and blackberry filling with spiced ground accents.

Diminutive, smoked pork-and-beef bangers are snugly rolled up into salty dough \"bedrolls\" until only their \"heads\" are poking out. The expert maneuver is to brush these little snacks with a thin egg wash before popping them in the oven, ensuring a glossy shine and a boost of color.

Bread, buttered on the outside, is layered with strips of cheese, sprinkled with seasoning, and pan-fried, before being sliced into strips, or \"dippers,\" for soup dunking. The recipe itself is quite simple (and really just an excuse to eat more cheese)! Sometimes served spicy, these sandwiches are often dashed with dill, nutmeg, basil, or the like, depending on the mood of the chef. The same goes for the accompanying soup, commonly a chunky tomato but occasionally a smooth red pepper puree. It's always served warm, more as a sort of dipping sauce that can be guzzled once the cheeses have disappeared. One of the simplest midday recipes in the halfling repertoire, melted cheeses have also been heavily adopted by humans across the land, with the dish adorning countless tavern menus.": "半身人不仅了解他们的奶酪，他们还拥有无数种准备奶酪的方法。面包外面涂上黄油，上面铺上奶酪条，撒上调料，然后煎一下，再切成条状，或者叫 \"蘸酱\"，用来灌汤。食谱本身很简单（实际上只是一个吃更多奶酪的借口）! 这些三明治有时会有辣味，通常会加入莳萝、肉豆蔻、罗勒或类似的东西，这取决于厨师的心情。配套的汤也是如此，通常是大块的西红柿，但偶尔也有光滑的红辣椒泥。它总是热着喝，更多的是作为一种蘸酱，一旦奶酪消失，就可以大口大口地喝。作为半身人食谱中最简单的午间食谱之一，融化的奶酪也被各地的人类大量采用，这道菜成为无数酒馆菜单的装饰。",
	"The Miner's Pie, sometimes referred to as a \"shepherd's pie\" by humans and halflings, is a truly hearty one-stop meal for the tireless dwarf in all of us. Ground beef (or lamb or venison), sweet corn, peas, onions, and leeks are crusted by a potato mash topped with cheese. This is one of the few dwarven dishes readily served at inns across Faerûn, particularly those of the North and Heartlands, likely because the human variant borrows much from this dwarven classic.": "矿工馅饼，有时被人类和半身人称为 \"牧羊人馅饼\"，对于我们所有人中不知疲倦的侏儒来说，这是真正丰盛的一站式膳食。碎牛肉（或羊肉或鹿肉）、甜玉米、豌豆、洋葱和韭菜被土豆泥包裹着，上面还有奶酪。这是整个法鲁恩的旅馆中为数不多的矮人菜肴之一，特别是那些北方和心脏地带的旅馆，可能是因为人类的变体在很大程度上借鉴了这个矮人的经典。",
	"Originated in the mythical elven isle of Evermeet but popularized by adventurous expatriates along the Sword Coast and its scattered archipelago, this creamy fish rice dish requires a patient chef...but it's well worth the wait! Short-grain rice (which yields a stickier, compact texture), along with a medley of ocean \"fruits,\" including shrimp and scallops, is slow cooked in a rich seafood broth until it reaches a smooth, velvety consistency. Butter, onion, saffron, elven dry white wine, and olive oil all intermingle and do their part in activating the dreamy maritime flavors. Some elven chefs of old would finish the dish with a swirl of mascarpone.": "这道奶油鱼饭起源于神话中的精灵岛Evermeet，但在剑海岸及其分散的群岛上被富有冒险精神的侨民所推广，这道菜需要一个有耐心的厨师......但它非常值得等待 短粒米（产生更粘稠、更紧凑的质地），以及各种海洋 \"水果\"，包括虾和扇贝，在丰富的海鲜汤中慢煮，直到达到光滑、天鹅绒般的稠度。黄油、洋葱、藏红花、精灵族的干白葡萄酒和橄榄油都交织在一起，为激活梦幻般的海洋风味尽一份力量。一些古老的精灵厨师会在这道菜的最后加上一圈马斯卡彭奶酪。",
	"When the hearth fire dims in the Underdark, the drow are known to reach for their kettles—not to make any herbal tea, but instead an after-dinner broth of simmering mushrooms. If they can find them, the drow prefer matsutake, though shiitake or maitake will do in a pinch. They place the sliced mushrooms into a clear broth seasoned with dried kelp, sometimes with a splash of fish stock or soy sauce and alcohol, and heat it in a teakettle. From this, they pour small cups of the fragrant tea to imbibe slowly until the mushrooms cook to perfection, at which point they are eaten with a fine skewer.": "当暗黑世界的炉火变暗时，众所周知，乌鸦会伸手去拿水壶--不是为了做任何草药茶，而是为了做饭后的煨蘑菇汤。如果他们能找到，乌鸦更喜欢松茸，尽管香菇或平菇在紧要关头也能做到。他们把切好的蘑菇放入用干海带调味的清汤中，有时加入鱼汤或酱油和酒精，并在茶壶中加热。他们从中倒出一小杯芳香的茶，慢慢地喝，直到蘑菇煮得很熟，这时就用一根细串来吃。",
	"Dwarves are widely renowned for their \"unsweet tooth,\" but that doesn't deny them good taste, as evidenced by the southern Faerûnian gold dwarves' affinity for orange and persimmon mountain duck. The uniquely hot-and-tart sauce brightens the succulent gamey meat and yields a divine duck-skin treat. Perhaps years of living near humans wore them down or broadened their palate, but it is said modern dwarves have actually come to blows over the coveted crispy skin alone!

	"This famous side dish, comprising chopped potatoes, served spiced and fried, is derived from the personal recipe of Otik Sandath, proprietor and chef of the Inn of the Last Home, located in a remote Krynn city called Solace in Ansalon. Otik's personal blend of garlic, paprika, pepper, cayenne, and a sizeable scoop of local salted butter is often emulated but tough to beat; however, the recipe featured below is widely thought to be the closest that one can come to the feeling of sitting atop the famed vallenwood tree tavern with one of his homebrewed dark ales in hand. These potatoes pair well with any braised meats on the menu or with eggs as a day starter.": "这道著名的配菜由切碎的土豆组成，以香料和油炸的方式食用，源自奥蒂克-桑达斯的个人食谱，他是位于安萨隆一个叫索拉斯的偏远克莱恩城市的老板和厨师。欧提克个人对大蒜、辣椒、胡椒、卡宴和一大勺当地咸黄油的混合配料经常被模仿，但很难被打败；然而，人们普遍认为下面的食谱最接近于坐在著名的瓦伦林树酒馆顶上，手捧他自酿的黑啤酒的感觉。这些土豆可以与菜单上的任何红烧肉搭配，也可以与鸡蛋搭配，作为一天的开胃菜。",
	"There isn't much to see and even less to eat in the frozen tundra that is Icewind Dale...unless you know where to look. North of the Spine of the World and hidden in the windswept shadow of Kelvin's Cairn, stand three freshwater lakes that support the ten villages that dot their shores—a region aptly known as Ten Towns. The lakes of Ten Towns are unremarkable, except for one feature: they are the only known location of the storied knucklehead trout. Named for their thick, knuckle-shaped skulls, these fish have become the region's most lucrative export, not for their culinary value but rather for the finely crafted scrimshaw that local artisans make with the ivory-like headbones. Merchants from Luskan and beyond pay top dollar for these curios, which have become all the rage throughout the cities of Faerûn. As a result, lakes of Ten Towns often run red with the blood of local fisherman competing for the day's catch. However, what's less known outside of the region is that these rare fish are as delicious as they are valuable, especially when pan-fried with shallots, lemon, salt, pepper, and paprika. If you can't source fresh knucklehead trout from the lakes of Ten Towns, don't dismay. Trout from Nyr Dyv near the City of Greyhawk or Crystalmir Lake close to Solace will suffice as substitutes.": "在冰风谷这个冰冻的苔原上，没有什么可看的，更没有什么可吃的......除非你知道去哪里找。在世界之脊的北面，隐藏在凯尔文之巢的风影中，有三个淡水湖，支撑着湖岸边的十个村庄--这个地区被称为十镇。十镇的湖泊并不起眼，只有一个特点：它们是唯一已知的传说中的节头鳟鱼的所在地。这些鱼因其厚厚的、指节状的头骨而得名，已成为该地区最有利可图的出口产品，不是因为它们的烹饪价值，而是因为当地工匠用象牙般的头骨制作的精巧的装饰品。来自卢斯坎和其他地方的商人为这些古玩支付了高价，这些古玩已经成为整个法鲁恩城市的热门。因此，十镇的湖泊经常被当地渔民为争夺当天的渔获而流下的鲜血染红。然而，在该地区以外鲜为人知的是，这些罕见的鱼和它们的价值一样美味，尤其是在用香葱、柠檬、盐、胡椒和辣椒粉煎制时。如果你不能从Ten Towns的湖泊中找到新鲜的节节鱼，不要沮丧。灰鹰城附近的Nyr Dyv或靠近索拉斯的Crystalmir湖的鳟鱼就可以作为替代品。",
	"Whether you're a warrior doffing your plate mail after an arduous adventure or a wizard relaxing after a studious session in the stacks, each day demands time for repose. From an obscure oolong to a common chamomile, teas are imbued with incredible calming and restorative effects for the body and soul. The powerful white-robed Highmage Par-Salian was renowned for his arcane prowess, but those close to him warmly recounted his potent tea leaf homebrew as well. A single saucer full of this extraordinary blend, which was known to include a fresh ginger infusion with honey, chamomile, dried lemon, orange peel, and a dash of slippery elm bark (granting it a smooth, oily aftertaste) among its components, was said to soothe even the most dogged cold—an effect that ensured the survival of one of Par-Salian's most famous students, Raistlin Majere.

	"In the world of Krynn, shortly after the ancient Kinslayer Wars, Prince Kith-Kanan appealed to his brother King Sithas for western sovereignty. His brother peacefully granted the western elves independence from the nation of Silvanesti. However, Kith-Kanan, the new king of the western elves, was met with decades of hardships resulting from the diaspora. Until their capital Qualinost was founded, his elven people struggled to find new ways of living off the land. Several simple and humble meals entered the repertoire of the elven diet, including \"Harvest Prize,\" an artfully prepared baked vegetable casserole. Sourceable produce such as eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, and tomato were thinly sliced then stacked in fanned layers upon fresh basil and tomato (crushed into a sauce), then drizzled with fresh and fragrant oils before roasting. This humble yet abundant dish could feed an entire elven village at little cost. Although the elves of Krynn now prepare variations of this dish year-round with inspired substitutions to harness the seasons, the combination below is the most classic and recommended.": "在克莱恩的世界里，在古代弑君者战争之后不久，王子基斯-卡南向他的兄弟西塔斯国王呼吁获得西部的主权。他的哥哥和平地授予西部精灵从希尔瓦内斯蒂国家独立出来。然而，西部精灵的新国王基斯-卡南却遭遇了数十年的散居生活带来的艰难困苦。在他们的首都奎里诺斯特建立之前，他的精灵族人一直在努力寻找新的生活方式，靠土地生存。几种简单而简陋的饭菜进入了精灵族的饮食食谱，包括 \"丰收奖\"，一种精心准备的烘烤蔬菜砂锅。茄子、西葫芦、黄瓜和西红柿等可获得的农产品被切成薄片，然后在新鲜的罗勒和西红柿（压成酱）上叠成扇形，然后在烤之前淋上新鲜和芳香的油。这道简陋而丰富的菜肴可以用很少的成本养活整个精灵村。虽然克莱恩的精灵们现在一年四季都在准备这道菜的变体，并通过灵感的替换来驾驭季节，但下面的组合是最经典的，也是最值得推荐的。",

To endure the arduous cold of Icewind Dale, the Reghed and other similar groups, such as the Uthgardt of Northern Faerûn, must maximize time and energy to thrive. Communal meals at winter camps (constructed seasonally to survive the exceptionally long winter) are as central to their dignified warrior culture as their deep religious traditions. Venison (the meat of antelope, deer, or elk) is the most readily available, and thus coveted, finding various uses for these resourceful nomads, but beef or rothé is completely acceptable in other realms. One ceremonial dish (to which the Reghed stake proud claim) that marks the beginning of the long winter is pot roast.

	"Popularized in Khorvaire's frigid northeastern nation of Karrnath, this savory dinner bread has staved off numerous famines and sometimes served as an all-in-one ration for the country's living soldiers (don't ask what the non-living soldiers eat).

Unsurprisingly, this tasty staple has migrated to many different worlds, each adding its own local flourish and embracing it as their own. This particular recipe comes from Lorren's Bakery in Faerûn's Village of Red Larch, and features mushrooms and cheese from local, outlying farms.

Some barkeeps substitute amaretto for a liqueur that mimics the taste of almond but forgoes nuts entirely in favor of herbs and spice, while others add their own twists to the tried-and-true recipe.

And few dishes stood out more than Beluir's famous poached salmon. Available at virtually any eating house in town, the most traditional preparation came from the Friendly Burrow tavern, which created a mouthwatering spread, comprising both fresh and smoked salmon, herbs, cream cheese, and a touch of cayenne, served atop a baguette with a sprinkle of capers. If you couldn't get into the Friendly Burrow (it was always packed), the Cold Duck Inn made a worthy representation, and they even had rooms for rent that could accommodate \"tall folk\" guests who needed a rest after all that dining.

But in times of plenty, you can still find soups filled with generous chunks of boar and without any bones to speak of.

A spritz of lemon and a dash of salt help to not only preserve the mash for canning but brighten the overall experience on the palette. Brackleberry Jam is as common as butter in the forest-heavy country of Cormyr, where its topography and climate yield an abundance of seasonal berries so plentiful they colorfully adorn the region's roads and trails.

But one thing you will know is she makes them hot: with the sort of spices mortals should avoid unless in ethereal form. The chickpeas offer a starchy and earthy sanctuary from the oily, spicy sausage and red pepper flakes, all of it swimming in a garlicky chicken broth, flavored with tomato.

Sometimes served pan-griddled, other times fried, this bread can be eaten plain, topped with cheese or {@recipe Underdark Lotus with Fire Lichen Spread||duergar fire lichen spread}, or used to soak up all of those savory juices and sauces from what dwarven diners showed up for in the first place—meat!": "数代矮人铁匠都依赖这种美味的小吃面包来度过漫长而艰苦的工作日，并等到下一顿饭。根据传说，这些美味的扁平面包并非是在厨房里创造的，而是在锻造场中，勤劳而饥饿的矮人工匠利用他们唯一可获得的材料：面粉、油、水、盐、炉火和锤子。结果呢？扁平面包。有时候是煎锅烤的，有时候是油炸的，这种面包可以单独食用，撒上奶酪或{@recipe Underdark Lotus with Fire Lichen Spread||duergar fire lichen spread}，或者用来吸收那些美味汁液和酱料，这些才是矮人食客首先前来的原因——肉！",
	"Despite its promise of a \"banquet,\" the dish known as Eldeen Banquet is actually a hearty, one-dish meal sure to satisfy omnivores as much as vegetarians. Consisting of lightly breaded and fried eggplant topped with a warm, seasoned tomato sauce, this delight hails from the Eldeen Reaches, in the Khorvaire region of Eberron, which is noted for its robust forests and agriculture, and where the dish has occasionally migrated to the Feywild via a secret Fey Crossing. But while Eldeen Banquet is considered a regional delicacy, interpretations of the crispy, yet spongy, eggplant patty are common in esteemed eateries throughout the city of Sharn. High-end restaurants such as the Azure Gateway and the Celestial Vista, in the Skyway district, offer plates of Eldeen Banquet as delightful as their views. However, perhaps the best preparation is found in the unassuming Olladra's Arms, in the Hope's Peak district. Here, the portions are as generous as they are flavorful, ensuring the dish truly lives up to its moniker.": "尽管被称为“宴会”，Eldeen Banquet 这道菜实际上是一道丰盛的一餐菜肴，能够满足肉食者和素食者。这道美食由轻微裹面炸茄子，再浇上温暖、调味的番茄酱组成，源自于埃伯隆大陆的科瓦尔地区的 Eldeen Reaches，以其茂密的森林和农业而闻名。这道菜有时会通过一处秘密的精灵十字路口迁移到精灵界。虽然 Eldeen Banquet 被视为地方美食，但在沙恩市的知名餐馆中，对这款酥脆却又有弹性的茄子饼的诠释是常见的。位于天空区的 Azure Gateway 和 Celestial Vista 等高档餐厅供应的 Eldeen Banquet 菜肴美味可口，且景色宜人。然而，也许最好的准备方法是在 Hope's Peak 区不起眼的 Olladra's Arms 餐厅中找到。在这里，份量丰盛且美味可口，确保这道菜真正名副其实。",
	"Centuries of deforestation has caused the elves of Elfharrow to get more creative with their diets than those of their forest-based counterparts. Raising livestock has become a way of life for these elves, making dairy a central staple of their foodways. This traditional Elfharrow dish features medallions of goat cheese crusted in breadcrumbs and baked. The key ingredient, though, is a tangy mustard, said to originate in the Feywild, and the dish goes best with a green salad on the side. A word of caution: Don't try to source your ingredients in Elfharrow—these elves are quite a bit more territorial and protective than their northern cousins and a visit there could be your last.": "几个世纪的砍伐导致Elfharrow的精灵在饮食方面比他们生活在森林中的同类更有创意。养殖家畜已经成为这些精灵的生活方式，使乳制品成为他们饮食中的中心食物。这道传统Elfharrow菜肴以面包屑裹着的山羊奶酪肉饼为特色，然后烘烤。然而，关键的成分是一种来自Feywild的浓郁芥末，这道菜最适合搭配一份绿色沙拉。一句警告：不要试图在Elfharrow采购食材——这些精灵比他们北方的表亲更有地盘意识和保护意识，前往那里可能会是你的最后一次。",
	"Elven Flatbread is much more of a delight than its unassuming name suggests. A mosaic of colors and flavors, the thinly sliced vegetables, edible flora, and wild herbs are so elegantly placed atop this chewy focaccia that you almost want to admire it more than eat it. A cornucopia of garden-fresh components frequently make starring appearances—from onions, bell peppers, chives, and cherry tomatoes to sunflowers, elderflowers, squash blossoms, and sprigs of basil. Almost nothing is off-limits when it comes to topping; the only (unspoken) rule is to keep it vibrant and arrange them artfully. Despite elven flatbread being a \"simple\" bread recipe, Feywild eladrin pride themselves on flare and personal presentation. During harvest holidays, each flatbread is presented as a long and ornate loaf that serves as both a centerpiece and a meal starter for dipping in sharp, fragrant olive oils.": "精灵薄饼比其朴素的名字所暗示的要美味得多。一片色彩和味道的马赛克，薄切的蔬菜、可食用植物和野生草药如此优雅地摆放在这块有嚼劲的佛卡夏面包上，以至于你几乎更想欣赏它而不是吃掉它。从洋葱、甜椒、细香葱和樱桃番茄到向日葵、接骨木花、南瓜花和新鲜罗勒叶，花园里新鲜的成分经常扮演主角。在添加配料方面几乎没有限制；唯一的（未明说的）规则是保持色彩鲜艳并巧妙地摆放它们。尽管精灵薄饼是一个“简单”的面包食谱，精灵界的艾拉德林们以其独特风格和个人呈现而自豪。在丰收节日期间，每个薄饼被呈现为一条又长又华丽的面包，既是中心装饰又是浸入浓烈芬芳橄榄油的开胃菜。",
	"This autumnal aperitif of rare quality and divine taste is customarily served in conjunction with an elven high ceremony. Traditional Elverquisst vintages are distilled from orosks and resmers (rare summer fruits indigenous to Evereska) and sunshine, and it sips as smoothly as a cool mountain stream. Elves store their Elverquisst in crystal decanters capable of absorbing light and showcasing the tantalizing specks of gold dancing about in the rich claret mixture. According to legend, upon whispering a secret Elvish phrase, the sunlight streaming through the bottle will gather into thirteen points, resembling the constellation Correlian. Regardless, Elverquisst is highly prized by the elves and is a uniquely enchanting sip for curious imbibers who can get their hands on a bottle of this rare beverage.": "这款稀有品质和神圣口味的秋季开胃酒通常与精灵的高级仪式一起享用。传统的艾尔维奎斯（Elverquisst）酿酒品种是由奥洛斯克（orosks）和雷斯默（resmers）（两种生长在埃维瑟卡（Evereska）的稀有夏季水果）以及阳光蒸馏而成，口感如同凉爽的山泉水。精灵们将他们的艾尔维奎斯存放在能吸收光线并展示富含深红色混合物中闪烁金色点点的水晶酒器中。根据传说，当低声念出一句秘密的精灵短语时，透过瓶子的阳光会聚集成十三个点，形成类似于康瑞利安星座的图案。无论如何，艾尔维奎斯深受精灵们的珍爱，对于那些能得到这种稀有饮料的好奇饮者来说，它是一种独特迷人的饮品。",
	"It is fact that the only way in or out of Sigil is through one of the city's innumerable portals. It is also fact that while in Sigil, one must try the famous Emerald Chicken. Gifted its name from the splash of chopped greens, intermingled with chunks of fowl, chicken livers, onions, and a strong dash of incendiary spices, Emerald Chicken demands an adventurous palate—it was originally made for tieflings with fiendspices—and a cool glass of ale to quench the burn. A milder version became famous in far-off Purskul, on Toril, in eateries such as the Owlroost Head.": "事实上，进出锡基尔（Sigil）的唯一方式是通过城市无数的传送门之一。同样事实是，在锡基尔，人们必须尝试一下著名的翡翠鸡（Emerald Chicken）。这道菜得名于切碎的青菜、混合着鸡块、鸡肝、洋葱和大量辛辣香料的炫目风味，翡翠鸡需要一个富有冒险精神的味蕾——最初是为了那些有恶魔香料的鬼族人而制作的——以及一杯凉爽的啤酒来平息火辣的口感。在遥远的托瑞尔（Toril）上的普斯库尔（Purskul）等餐馆，如猫头鹰巢头（Owlroost Head），也出名了一种更温和的版本。",

The nuanced yet indulgent combination of fresh sweet peas, shallots, and feta cheese is a match made in Arvandor, especially once handfuls of the bite-size bounty are dipped in batter and fried to perfection. From Prismeer to Evermeet, elves and those with whom they hold court relish these comforting table treats. Fey Fritters come with a warning: Once you try one, you'll want to spend all day eating these scrumptious snacks...and often, in the Feywild, you just do! It is believed that the recipe originated a millennium ago in the elven enclave of Evermeet, far before it was transported to the Plane of Faerie following the Spellplague.

	"Fig cakes are an easily preserved pouch snack for explorers with a sweet tooth. A perfect fig cake is as much about the fig as it is about the lightly toasted and ground almonds that form this fruity confection's chewy base. While honeyed fig tarts were extremely popular in Calimshan on the planet Toril, it is believed that this unique dessert originally hailed from the desolate wastes of the Shadowfell. Developed by the elves native to the Plane of Shadow called the Shadar-Kai, these treats are sweet enough to be at home even in the dreamy Feywild. In addition to the sesame seeds and anise seeds, a strong brandy is often infused into the mix, to both sweeten and fortify these small pressed cakes. While fig cakes do not come cheap, they are, nonetheless, a proud (and delicious) reminder of the resourcefulness of the Shadar-Kai.": "无花果饼是一种易保存的袋装零食，非常适合对甜食感兴趣的探险家。一个完美的无花果饼不仅关乎无花果本身，还与轻轻烤过和磨碎的杏仁一起构成了这款果味糖果的有嚼劲的基底。虽然在托瑞尔星球的卡利姆沙特区非常流行蜜糖无花果馅饼，但据信这种独特的甜点最初起源于暗影界的荒凉荒野。由暗影界本地的精灵夏达凯（Shadar-Kai）研发，这些美食甜蜜到足以适应梦幻般的精灵界。除了芝麻籽和茴香籽外，通常还会加入浓郁的白兰地，既甜美又增强这些小蛋糕的口感。虽然无花果饼并不便宜，但它们无疑是夏达凯聪明机智（而美味）的骄傲象征。",

As quick to fry as it is to consume, this chili-and-cayenne-tinged, batter-fried white fish is a feast for the taste buds. Best served sizzling-hot, straight from the pan, wrapped in locally cultivated lettuce or a flatbread for easy ingestion en route to the next plane.": "在西格尔（Sigil）的大市集也许是已知多元宇宙中最著名的市场——一个充满文化和美食的繁华交汇点——这座自封为“多元宇宙中心的城市”也拥有无数的商铺和街头市场，提供同样稀有和令人兴奋的美食。火焰裹金鱼（Fire-Wrapped Golden Fish）就是其中一种廉价的美味，可以在下层区（Lower Ward）或更为贫困的蜂巢区（Hive Ward）轻松获得。这种辣椒和红辣椒调味的面糊炸白鱼不仅炸制迅速，而且食用起来也很快乐。最好趁热上桌，直接从锅中取出，用当地培育的生菜或扁饼包裹，方便在前往下一个位面的途中轻松食用。",

	"This soy-based protein dish originated from a gnome recipe, but it is equally popular with those who shy away from animal meat, including some communities of elves. It is also ideal in environments where livestock is harder to keep, such as the Underdark and the Rock of Bral. The original gnome version uses chicken broth as a base, but vegetable broths work just as well. While the tofu is the star, the mélange of scallions, bok choy, bell pepper, and carrots imparts a variety of textures and flavors. Rice-based cooking wine and soy sauce make it a lustrous and savory meal.": "这道以大豆为基础的蛋白菜肴源自一份侏儒食谱，但同样受到那些避开动物肉类的人的喜爱，包括一些精灵社区。在牲畜难以饲养的环境中，比如地底世界和布拉尔岩石上，这道菜也很受欢迎。原始的侏儒版本以鸡肉汤为基础，但蔬菜汤同样适用。虽然豆腐是主角，但葱、青菜、甜椒和胡萝卜的混合为菜肴增添了多样的口感和风味。米酒和酱油使其成为一道光泽且美味的餐点。",

You aren't doing it right unless a sizable slab of salted yak butter or the like is slathered on top to melt into its deep, dark nooks.

Regardless of which varietal you choose, kaeth, in its endless forms, serves as a caffeine-infused pick-me-up, whether on the trail or in the safe confines of one's homestead.": "卡斯(Kaeth)，或咖啡，是一种由研磨烘焙豆制成的芳香饮料，以其提神作用而闻名于多元宇宙的世界中，成为了普遍的一日开始者。在门之城锡基尔(Sigil)，来自无数星球的平面观光者可以品尝各种各样的咖啡豆和饮料。卡斯，在托瑞尔(Toril)行星上通常被称为，已经发展成了剑海岸(Sword Coast)地区的一种美味佳肴，如今大量进口。在森比亚(Sembia)国家，一种流行的制备方法包括融化巧克力和酒的混合。在一些地区，卡斯如此受欢迎，以至于比茶叶贸易更具盈利性。克瑞恩(Krynn)行星的人们喝焦豆茶(tarbean tea)和凯弗(kefre)，两者都是由充满活力的深烘焙豆制成，经常是纯黑色的。相比之下，外部位面的居民饮用许多香料和奶油变种的卡斯，包括值得注意的天界之山(Mountain Majesty)。在欧斯(Oerth)行星上，咖啡的趋势更酸，经常混合进奶油酒精饮料中以增添额外的力量。但也许最引人注目的是kav'la，在这种饮料中，奶油椰奶被搅拌进一种麦芽、深色、坚果味的烘焙豆中，装在高大、华丽的陶瓷器皿中，在锡基尔的文化集市中很容易找到。无论你选择哪种品种，卡斯，在其无尽的形式中，都是一种含咖啡因的提神饮料，无论是在旅途中还是在自己的家园中，都能让人精神焕发。",
	"Kender loaf, or raston pastry as it has been called, is a filling, raisin-specked dessert to round out a hearty meal. However, in its earlier incarnations, raston pastry dated back to the first Dragon War, when not even scraps of stale bread could be discarded. Crusts of stale bread were habitually tossed into a basin and later mashed to create livestock feed, but the kender saw an opportunity. Stale bread was separated from other half-finished morsels; soaked in water; sugared, spiced, and dried; then served up as what was known as kender loaf, the pre-owned bread. So popular was kender loaf that the process was refined with eggs, cream, and spices, evolving into the bread puddings we know today.": "肯德面包，或者被称为拉斯顿糕点，是一种填饱肚子的、点缀着葡萄干的甜点，用来收尾一顿丰盛的饭菜。然而，在早期版本中，拉斯顿糕点可以追溯到第一次龙战，那时甚至连一丝陈旧面包屑都不能被丢弃。陈旧面包的外壳通常被扔进一个容器中，后来被捣碎制成牲畜饲料，但肯德族人看到了机会。陈旧面包被分开放置，与其他未吃完的食物分开；浸泡在水中；加糖、加香料、晾干；然后被端上桌，成为所谓的肯德面包，这种二手面包。肯德面包如此受欢迎，以至于这个过程被改进，加入了鸡蛋、奶油和香料，演变成了我们今天所知道的面包布丁。",
	"Kender legends have a way of shifting and swaying merrily with the tides of the Blood Sea of Istar. An early tale held that kender stumblenoodles were born of a collision between two frantic kender cooks—when their pots mixed, it resulted in an unexpected alliance of flavors and ingredients. However, ask a kender adventurer, and you may as likely hear a yarn concerning a well-placed insult aimed toward a draconian corporal and his squad. As the bold kender scoundrel made haste to flee, he frantically threw about any valuables behind him to dissuade his pursuers. In his desperation, he ejected a small sack of mixed spices, hardened cheese, a jar of mustard, and several handfuls of uncooked spiral pasta shells that, as kender luck would have it, served as a meal of caltrops for draconian toes and sent the kender's pursuers stumbling into the mud. In honor of this brave kender's sacrifice (the loss of a perfectly good sack of pasta), kender across Krynn have memorialized the occasion in classic, good-humored kender fashion.": "肯德传说总是随着伊斯塔尔之血海的潮汐轻快地摇摆变幻。一个早期传说称，肯德炊面条是由两位狂乱的肯德厨师相撞而生——当他们的锅混合时，结果是意想不到的风味和成分联盟。然而，询问一位肯德冒险者，你可能同样听到一个关于对一位龙人下士及其小队发出的恰到好处的侮辱的故事。当大胆的肯德恶棍匆匆逃离时，他拼命地向身后抛掷任何贵重物品以阻止追击者。在绝望中，他抛出了一小袋混合香料、硬奶酪、一罐芥末和几把未煮熟的螺旋意大利面贝壳，正如肯德的幸运所带来的，这些食材成了龙人脚趾的铁蒺藜，使追击者们跌跌撞撞地落入泥潭。为了纪念这位勇敢的肯德的牺牲（失去了一袋完好无损的意大利面），克瑞恩各地的肯德们以经典、幽默的肯德风格纪念这一事件。",
	"Nothing warms the soul quite like the scent of a freshly baked kender cobbler. The flavor of this effervescent blend of peaches, dark berries, vanilla, cloves, and liquor (for the brave, a sizable enough dash to make your toes tingle) is as fascinating as the diminutive folk who invented it. Kender—said to be birthed of magic and chaos—approach food in much the same manner as they traverse the worlds of the multiverse: adventurously. The buttery, flaky topping oozing with soft, chopped peaches should be enough, but when combined with blueberries, the cobbler filling brightens in a curiously kender way. This dessert is especially popular on Mid-year Day in Sixthmonth, which also happens to be Peach Month in Ansalon, but it remains the dessert of choice for the kender of Krynn regardless of holiday or season. Often served as a cobbler, sometimes as a crumble, but never to be skipped, especially when offered warm with a hefty dollop of fresh whipped cream.": "没有什么能像新鲜烤制的肯德饼干那样温暖人心。这种充满活力的桃子、深色浆果、香草、丁香和酒精（对于勇敢的人来说，加入足够多的量会让你的脚趾发麻）的味道，就像发明它的矮人一样迷人。肯德——据说是由魔法和混乱诞生的——在处理食物时与他们穿越多元宇宙的方式非常相似：充满冒险精神。黄油味浓郁、酥脆的馅料中混合着软软的切碎桃子应该已经足够了，但当与蓝莓结合时，饼干的馅料以一种奇特的肯德方式变得更加明亮。这道甜点在第六个月的中年日特别受欢迎，这也恰好是安萨隆的桃子月，但无论是假日还是季节，它仍然是克瑞恩的肯德人的首选甜点。通常作为水果馅饼，有时作为一种松脆的甜点，但永远不要错过，尤其是当它温热地搭配一大勺新鲜打发的奶油时。",
	"The Yawning Portal of Waterdeep serves a new pie every week, based on the seasonal ingredients available. You're really in luck when laumberries from the frosty Frozenfar are in season. Their tartness is softened by the sweetness of the dough, making it the perfect blend of flavors. The famous tavern likely pilfered the idea from the hardy bakers of Bryn Shander. Pies in this style are made off-season with blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries, which together give you something of the flavor of the original. They're best served a bit chilled, and when done right have been known to resurrect the spirits of weary adventurers emerging from the Undermountain.": "在瓦特德普的打哈欠传送门(The Yawning Portal)每周供应一种新派，基于当季的食材。当来自冰冻远野(Frozenfar)的酸浆果正当季时，你真的很幸运。它们的酸味被面团的甜味所软化，使得口味完美融合。这家著名的酒馆很可能是从布林尚德(Bryn Shander)那些坚韧的面包师那里窃取了这个主意。这种风格的派在淡季时用蓝莓、黑莓和覆盆子制作，这些一起给你带来了原始口味的一些味道。它们最好稍微冷藏一下，如果做得恰到好处，还能让从地下山(Undermountain)出来的疲惫冒险者们重振精神。",
	"The Elfsong Tavern of Baldur's Gate is known for many things: the disembodied singing voice of an elven maiden for which the tavern is named; the stuffed baby beholder over the mantle; and the driftglobe-lit taproom. But there is no better reason to visit this famous haven for adventurers than its delectable Loaf Pudding. A specialty of halfling head-chef Chenna Fatrabbit and her human pastry sidekick, Klav Martilmur, this moist, yogurt-infused loaf is soaked in a delicious vanilla-almond syrup and topped with a sprinkle of salted almonds to add just the right amount of crunch. The dessert is so coveted that even Spelljammer pirates have occasionally dropped into port to bring a loaf or two back to Realmspace.": "博德尔之门（Baldur's Gate）的《精灵之歌酒馆》以许多事物而闻名：酒馆以一位精灵少女的无主歌声命名；壁炉上方的装饰着的幼年凝视者；以及被漂浮灯球照亮的酒吧。然而，造访这家著名的冒险者避风港的最好理由莫过于它的美味面包布丁。这是半身人主厨切娜·法特兔（Chenna Fatrabbit）和她的人类糕点助手克拉夫·马蒂尔默（Klav Martilmur）的特色菜，这款湿润、加入酸奶的面包浸泡在美味的香草杏仁糖浆中，再撒上一层盐腌杏仁碎，增添恰到好处的脆脆口感。这道甜点如此令人垂涎，甚至星际飞船海盗偶尔也会飞到港口，将一两块面包带回到位面空间（Realmspace）。",
	"While conventionally prepared with a base of {@creature owlbear|MM} milk, other types of milk such as yak milk, buttermilk, rice milk, and even nut milk are all suitable substitutes in this creamy, cozy concoction. But no matter which milk you choose, there is no alternative for Mingari spice, culled from the inner bark of Mingari trees. Likened in both flavor and scent to cinnamon, Mingari spice is a rare but highly sought-after seasoning indigenous to southeast Faerûn. Although rare, this strong, aromatic spice is incredibly versatile, at home in both sweet and savory dishes, and thus it has spread throughout the Realms and beyond. However, satisfying Mingari-Spiced Owlbear Milk requires merely a dash of this scarce but potent accent. Travelers in search of a day starter, an alcohol-infused night capper, or even a medicinal stomach soother, invariably relish a tall mug of this nourishing milk.": "传统上，这种奶制品是以{@creature owlbear|MM}牛奶为基础制备的，但是其他类型的奶，比如牦牛奶、酪乳、米奶，甚至坚果奶都是这种奶油舒适饮品的合适替代品。但无论你选择哪种奶，明加里香料都是不可替代的，它是从明加里树的内皮中提取的。明加里香料在口味和气味上都被比作肉桂，是一种罕见但备受追捧的调味料，原产于塞尔东部地区。尽管罕见，这种浓烈的芳香香料非常多才多艺，在甜食和咸食中都能发挥作用，因此它已经传遍了诸多领域。然而，制作明加里香料猫头鹰奶只需要加入一点点这种稀有但强烈的调味品。在寻找一天的开始、一天结束的酒精饮料，甚至是一种药用舒胃剂的旅行者们，总是喜欢一大杯这种滋养奶饮。",
	"Neverwinter nectar is an expensive but tasty spirit-based drink, known for its sweet fruit-infused flavor, buttery base, and citrus-tinged aftertaste. Perennially popular in Neverwinter, this \"nectar\" has gradually appeared on the drink lists of many of the finer eateries among the well-traveled cities of the Sword Coast. The surprisingly crisp and refreshing cocktail is so rich in flavor, it is often consumed in lieu of dessert or as an accompaniment to lighter fare. Veteran barkeeps unlock the full spectrum of flavors when they combine the unique mixture of juices, brandy, and white wine with a touch of sparkling water and ice. Felzoun's Folly, in Waterdeep, serves one of the more notable iterations of this syrupy and perfectly divine concoction.": "冬夜花蜜是一种昂贵但美味的基于烈酒的饮料，以其甜美的水果风味、奶油基调和柑橘味的余味而闻名。在冬夜广受欢迎，这种“花蜜”逐渐出现在剑海岸众多知名城市的精致餐厅的酒单上。这款令人惊喜的清爽鸡尾酒口味浓郁，常常代替甜点或作为搭配清淡食物的佐餐饮用。资深酒保们在将独特的果汁、白兰地和白葡萄酒混合物与一丝气泡水和冰块相结合时，释放出了完整的风味。在瓦特德普，费尔宗的愚行（Felzoun's Folly）供应了这种糖浆状、完美神圣的调制品中更为显著的版本之一。",
	"The onion loaf on the menu at the Yawning Portal is done in the Cormyr style: big, dark loaves, as dense as the King's Forest. While the onion may be the headliner, the real stars of the show are the leeks, scallions, and fresh buttermilk, which help round out the flavors of this rich, crusty loaf—perfect for morningfeast or eveningfeast. When it's time to break bread with adventuring companions, old and new, an onion loaf is an inexpensive and delicious option that's practically a meal in itself.": "在酒馆（(Yawning Portal)）的菜单上，洋葱面包是按科尔米尔（(Cormyr)）风格制作的：大块、深色的面包，像国王森林一样浓郁。虽然洋葱可能是主角，但真正的明星是韭葱、青葱和新鲜的酪乳，它们帮助调和了这款浓厚、有酥脆外皮的面包的味道——早餐或晚餐的完美选择。当与新旧冒险同伴共进晚餐时，洋葱面包是一个经济实惠且美味的选择，几乎可以算是一顿完整的餐点。",
	"Ornabra is a hearty meal and something of a badge of honor for those who have eaten it. This dish has been served for many generations by the hard-working denizens of Purskul (the \"Granary City\"), a bustling and notable caravan stop inland from Athkatla, between Amn's Cloud Peak and the Small Teeth mountains in West Faerûn. Lamb and potato stew is simmered for hours, then drained before being wrapped in thick and chewy flatbread the size of a small shield. As popular with Purskul's human constituents as with its sizable half-orc population, this street food is enough to fill a humanoid belly for two meals and is commonly scooped up by on-the-go, coin-conscious caravanners along the Southern Trade Way.": "奥纳布拉（Ornabra）是一道丰盛的美食，对于那些吃过它的人来说，也是一种荣誉徽章。这道菜由普斯库尔（Purskul，即“粮仓之城”）勤劳的居民代代相传，这座城市位于阿斯卡特拉（Athkatla）内陆，位于阿姆（Amn）的云峰和西法伦（West Faerûn）的小牙山之间，是一个繁忙且著名的商队中转站。羊肉土豆炖菜经过数小时的炖煮，然后沥干，再包裹在厚实而有嚼劲的扁平面包中，大小如小盾牌。这种街头食物不仅受到普斯库尔的人类居民欢迎，也深受其庞大的半兽人族群喜爱，足以填饱一个人类的肚子两顿饭，常常被匆忙赶路、注重节约的商队人员沿着南方贸易之路抢购。",
	"Par-Salian opened his mouth to speak, then realized Highmage Astathan was studying him very intently. He closed his mouth again. The tea lingered with a slightly oily aftertaste on his tongue, and Par-Salian finally recognized it. It was bekial seed from the thorn bushes of Estwilde; it acted to open one's consciousness without the deleterious effects of most other opiates. A little was enough to put its user in a trance. Too much was toxic. And the fine line between the two was only drawn by master herbologists.": "帕-萨利安张开嘴想说话，然后意识到高法师阿斯塔森正在非常专注地观察着他。他又闭上了嘴。茶在他的舌头上留下了一丝微油的余味，帕-萨利安终于认出了它。这是来自埃斯特怀尔德荆棘丛的贝基亚种子；它能够打开一个人的意识，而不会像大多数其他鸦片那样产生有害作用。少量就足以让使用者进入恍惚状态。太多则有毒。两者之间的微妙界限只有植物学大师才能划定。",
	"In the Faerûnian land of Amn, there is a charming, well-appointed inn called Stargath House, which is known for a signature baked-potato-and-anchovy dish called the Plate of Silver.

The treasured gold is said to rattle inside the chest plates of {@creature helmed horror|MM|helmed horrors} that seek to claim the lives of trespassers. Many a guest has disobeyed the firm guidance of the courteous waitstaff and gone missing. It is tradition that when the unique delicacy is served, the staff and regulars of Stargath House rattle their gold coins inside tumblers as a way of presenting the recipient of Stargath hospitality with a choice: \"Would you risk a cold and bitter death for the promise of haunted gold?

	"Barovia is known for many things, its wine among them. The Wizard of Wines Vineyard is legendary for producing some of the finest wines throughout the planes and multiverse, such as the full-bodied Red Dragon Crush and the crisp Champagne du le Stomp.

Priced at only three copper pieces per pint at most local taverns and other Domains of Dread, this table wine is known to be spectacularly unremarkable.

Named after an orc henchman of Lord Robilar, who inventively cooked this sausage meal for his adventuring party, using his shield for a skillet, Quij's Plate would eventually earn its place on the menu of the famed Green Dragon Inn, nestled in the Free City of Greyhawk's bustling River Quarter.

	"Let it be known, silverfruit, also known as lychee or soapberry, makes for a truly heavenly pie. This medium-size, pink-skinned berry is known for being especially crisp and juicy, with hints of citrus and a floral aroma. But as a pie filling it's surprisingly creamy and custard-like, and it pairs wonderfully with a toasted, flaky crust. The Golden Bariaur Inn (in Sigil's Lady's Ward), which caters to highfalutin clientele from the Upper Planes, serves an astoundingly good slice of this silky dessert. Since Sigil has no natural resources, silverfruit is one of the many uniquely curated imports from the vast array of worlds to which the greater metropolis provides access.": "让人们知晓，银果，也被称为荔枝或肥皂浆果，在制作馅饼时表现得非常美味。这种中等大小、粉红色外皮的浆果以其特别爽脆多汁、带有柑橘和花香味而闻名。但作为馅料，它出奇地奶油且像奶油般，与烤过的、酥脆的馅皮搭配得非常美味。《金色巴瑞尔客栈》（在西格尔的贵妇区），迎合来自上位位面的高贵客户，供应着这款丝滑甜点的一道惊人美味。由于西格尔没有自然资源，银果是从众多世界中精心挑选的进口商品之一，这些商品可以通过这座大都市提供的通道进入。",
	"Popular at holiday gatherings of humans and elves alike, sornstag is a simmered venison dish that can be seasoned and prepared in a variety of ways. Traditional elven sornstag is slow smoldered with ground coriander, cumin, and hotspice or curry in a thick broth and is a popular plate among wood elves during the Highharvestide Festival. Humans have also adopted their own stewed preparation techniques for this gamey, yet succulent, main course. Throughout the wooded regions of Faerûn, stags are hunted by humans for both sport and meal, resulting in the proliferation of venison-based cuisine. In the bucolic forests and fields of the Dalelands, the most popular regional recipe for sornstag demands a full day's preparation. The traditional recipe calls for powdered almonds simmered with red wine to form the emulsified base of a piquant sauce, in which the meat soaks overnight before it is slow-cooked on an open flame from dawn for an early evening feast. But to get it to the table faster, you can skip the overnight marinade and cook it in an oven for just a few hours. Notably, the Silver Taproom, in Essembra, sees travelers from far and wide eager to sample its famous pied sornstag, which consists of a heaping ladle of this venison stew baked inside a buttery crust. You'll know the sornstag pies are ready when the scent of the aromatic pastry wafts down bustling Rauthauvyr's Road.": "在人类和精灵的节日聚会中很受欢迎，索恩斯塔格（Sornstag）是一道炖鹿肉菜肴，可以用各种方式调味和准备。传统的精灵索恩斯塔格是用研磨过的芫荽、孜然和热香料或咖喱在浓郁的高汤中慢炖，是木精灵在高收获节庆典期间的一道受欢迎的菜肴。人类也采用了他们自己的炖制技巧来制作这道肉味浓郁、多汁的主菜。在费伦的林地地区，鹿被人类猎杀用于运动和食物，导致了以鹿肉为基础的美食的普及。在戴尔兰的田园风光中，索恩斯塔格最受欢迎的地区食谱需要整整一天的准备。传统食谱要求用红酒煮粉杏仁形成辛辣酱的乳化基础，肉在慢煮之前要在这种酱汁中浸泡过夜，然后从黎明开始在明火上慢煮，直到早晚的盛宴。但为了更快地上桌，你可以跳过隔夜腌制，用烤箱烹饪几个小时。值得一提的是，在埃森布拉（Essembra）的银色酒馆（Silver Taproom）吸引了来自四面八方渴望品尝其著名的派德索恩斯塔格（pied sornstag）的游客，这是一碗这道鹿肉炖菜烤在黄油酥皮内。当芳香的糕点气味飘过繁忙的劳索维尔之路（Rauthauvyr's Road）时，你就知道索恩斯塔格派已经准备好了。",
	"It's rare to see this halfling specialty on the table, usually because it's gone before you ever catch a glimpse of it. Perfect for morningfeast, or teatime, the much-celebrated sour cream-walnut cake includes a delicious crumble of cinnamon, brown sugar, and walnuts, but it's the cake itself that takes the cake. A recipe passed down orally by generations of halflings, it is said to be made with the finest Luiren grain flour, fresh sour cream, and finely ground kaeth or coffee. The only known issue with the pastry is that there never seems to be enough of it.": "很少能在餐桌上看到这种半身人特色，通常因为它会在你看到之前就消失了。非常适合早餐或下午茶时间的备受赞誉的酸奶核桃蛋糕包括美味的肉桂、红糖和核桃碎屑，但最吸引人的是蛋糕本身。这个食谱是半身人代代相传的口头传统，据说是用最好的卢伦谷物面粉、新鲜的酸奶和精细研磨的卡斯或咖啡制成的。这种糕点唯一已知的问题是似乎永远不够吃。",
	"It is said, \"When in space, do as spacefarers do,\" and this can prove useful advice when talking about food. One will never know how, or why, pork became such a readily available source of protein on the Rock of Bral, but that mystery is beside the point when a steaming bowl of spiced pork and orange peppers is on offer. In truth, the underside of the one-mile-long ovaloid asteroid, founded by humanoid Captain Bral, serves as a sustainable and farmable ecosystem capable of oxygen production. It even contains a freshwater lake (Lake Bral), frequently refilled by water harvested from ice asteroids, and, yes, livestock in the form of swine. Spiced Pork and Orange Peppers was a favorite of the famed Captain Bral and has remained a signature dish on the menu of the Laughing Beholder, run by gregarious beholder Large Luigi, and other notably unsavory eateries that dot the avenues of this lawless asteroid outpost. When ordered \"the Captain's way,\" the explosion of spices (paprika, coriander, cayenne, garlic, fennel, cumin, and some mystery space seed grown onsite) combined with the zest of the orange peppers is like a peg-legged dohwar kick straight to the taste buds.": "据说，“在太空中，要像太空航行者一样行事”，这在谈论食物时可以证明是有用的建议。人们永远不会知道为什么猪肉会成为布拉尔岩石上一种如此readily可获得的蛋白质来源，但当一碗热气腾腾的香料猪肉和橙色辣椒摆在面前时，这个谜团就无关紧要了。事实上，这颗一英里长的椭圆形小行星的底部，由类人船长布拉尔创建，作为一个可持续的、可耕种的生态系统，能够产生氧气。甚至还有一个淡水湖（布拉尔湖），经常由从冰小行星上收集的水重新注入，还有猪等牲畜。香料猪肉和橙色辣椒是著名船长布拉尔的最爱，并一直是“笑眼酒馆”的菜单上的招牌菜，由健谈的眼魔大卢伊吉经营，以及其他一些在这个无法无天的小行星前哨站的街道上点缀的著名的不怀好意的餐馆。当点“船长的方式”时，香料（辣椒粉、芫荽、红辣椒粉、大蒜、茴香、孜然和一些在现场种植的神秘太空种子）与橙色辣椒的清新结合，就像一记直接踢向味蕾的短腿多瓦尔踢。",
	"A refreshing nonalcoholic aperitif, the drink known as Sprucebark Quaff is famous throughout the multiverse for not only preparing the palate for flavor but also freshening the breath after meals. A simple concoction of clean, fresh water; mint; and sweet cucumber, it is served at upscale taverns, inns, and temples across the Prime Material Plane but is especially popular in the Feywild and upper planes, where a similar mixture forms naturally in many ponds, lakes, and streams. It's believed to have been invented by Faerûnian elves as a method of purifying water, using plants to remove toxins. Whatever its origin, it is sure to recharge trail-weary adventurers no matter what planet or plane they roam.": "一种清爽的无酒精开胃饮料，被称为云杉树皮饮料（Sprucebark Quaff）在整个多元宇宙中都很有名，不仅可以为口腔准备味蕾，还能在饭后清新口气。这种简单的混合饮料由清洁的淡水、薄荷和甜黄瓜制成，在主物质位面的高档酒馆、客栈和寺庙中供应，但在费伊界和上位位面特别受欢迎，在那里类似的混合物在许多池塘、湖泊和溪流中自然形成。据信这种饮料是由法罗尼亚精灵发明的，作为一种用植物去除毒素的净化水的方法。无论它的起源如何，它肯定会让疲惫的冒险者在漫游的任何星球或位面上恢复活力。",
	"According to legend, this hearty seafood steak was first prepared by homesick triton folk living among surface dwellers and eager for a nostalgic taste of their undersea home. Guardians of the deep, commonly clustered around ocean trenches and far from the eyes and reach of humankind, triton have increasingly emerged from self-imposed isolation to cohabit with the other peoples of the multiverse. A satisfying synthesis of tastes that borrows more from the surface world than from the seafloor, steak of the deep features a thick slab of braised swordfish, topped with a simmered tomato-based blend of onion, garlic, paprika, and a crisp dry sherry, yielding a fragrant and filling main course. While you won't find this in many triton settlements proper, it is a mainstay meal for well-traveled triton and is increasingly available at larger coastal taverns and, occasionally, the more far-flung spaceports of Realmspace.": "根据传说，这道丰盛的海鲜牛排首次是由怀念家乡的海底人类（triton）在地表居民中间准备的，他们渴望怀念他们在海底的家园的味道。作为深海守护者，triton通常聚集在海沟附近，远离人类的眼睛和触及范围，他们越来越多地走出自我隔离，与多元宇宙的其他种族共同生活。深海牛排是一种令人满足的口味综合，更多地借鉴了地表世界而不是海底的味道，它包括一块厚厚的烩剑鱼肉，上面覆盖着炖番茄为基础的洋葱、大蒜、辣椒粉和干雪利酒混合物，散发出芳香并且饱腹的主菜。虽然你在许多triton定居点找不到这道菜，但对于旅行经验丰富的triton来说，这是一道主食，而且在更大型的沿海酒馆和偶尔在雷尔姆空间（Realmspace）更偏远的太空港口也能找到。",
	"Those who happen upon the Solamnian city of Palanthus would be fools not to drop by the A Taste of Silvanost restaurant and try its famous Stuffed Trout. Of course, what the trout is stuffed with is anyone's guess. According to the menu (which is written in Silvanesti), you'll find \"specially prepared mixtures\" inside.

	"The palm-size sandwich known as talyth is a beloved appetizer on many a menu, from Waterdeep and the rustic watering holes of Luskan to the cloistered refectories of Candlekeep and eateries as far east as the Sea of Fallen Stars where, it is said, the dish originated. Although countless variations exist, talyth commonly comprises meats (typically sliced sausage), cheese, spices, and herbs nestled between two large crackers, all lightly baked to adhere the layers. While the baking process seals in flavor, it also ensures its portability, making talyth a common travel snack along the major Faerûnian trade routes. Although frozen talyth can easily be reheated on an open campfire, freshly made talyth affords a more eclectic and adventurous array of savory ingredients, including diced egg, oysters, snails, and even spiced worms.": "被称为塔利斯（Talyth）的手掌大小三明治是许多菜单上备受喜爱的开胃菜，从沃特德普（Waterdeep）和卢斯坎（Luskan）的乡村酒馆，到坎德尔堡（Candlekeep）的僧院餐厅，再到东至堕星之海（Sea of Fallen Stars）的餐馆，据说这道菜起源于那里。尽管有无数变种，塔利斯通常包括肉类（通常是切片香肠）、奶酪、香料和草药，夹在两片大饼干之间，轻轻烘烤以粘合层次。烘烤过程不仅封住了味道，也确保了它的便携性，使得塔利斯成为沿着法罗尼亚（Faerûn）主要贸易路线的常见旅行零食。尽管冷冻的塔利斯可以轻松在明火上重新加热，但新鲜制作的塔利斯提供了更多多样化和富有冒险精神的风味成分，包括切碎的鸡蛋、牡蛎、蜗牛，甚至是调味的虫子。",

Some of the finest examples exist a few miles to the south of Trademeet in Mosstone, at the venerable Drover's Last Drink, where they add a bit of vanilla and large-crystal sugar to the mix.

In this delectable maritime offering, poached shrimp are combined with a fresh yogurt-dill sauce, which can be delightful when dolloped atop long, homemade noodles. In a popular iteration of this dish, detailed in the culinary notes of Tika Waylan, former barmaid at the inn, \"pulled turkey breast is substituted for the shrimp and enlivened with a dash of dry white wine.\" The sauce itself is so flavorful, it can perk up even the most mundane meats, something resourceful locals were forced to do post-Cataclysm, which left the Tarsis seaport landlocked.

For those lucky travelers fortunate enough to escape the fog-shrouded confines of Barovia to Toril, a variation of this hearty and succulent feast is a specialty of the Boar with Black Tusks in Noanar's Hold, which sometimes uses pork when a boar cannot be procured and is often served with a dry ruby wine from Cormyr.": "在恐惧领域(Domains of Dread)中，吸血鬼主人的宴会上，整只烤野猪，或其部分，是一道受欢迎的菜肴。传言说主人们会等到他们的客人\"眼神迷离，下巴油腻，一种昏昏欲睡的愉悦感降临\"时，才会向每位客人的颈部插入一只尖牙，将他们吸干至满足。正确的准备要求厨师对果酱、波特酒和红糖有无所顾忌的热爱，大量地添加以调味肉类，确保您和您的客人将盘子上的一切都吃个干净。对于那些幸运地逃离了巴罗维亚的雾蒙蒙的范围前往托瑞尔的旅行者，这种丰盛多汁的宴会的变种是诺纳尔要塞(Noanar's Hold)的黑牙野猪的特色菜，有时会使用猪肉代替野猪，通常搭配科尔米尔(Cormyr)的干红葡萄酒。",
	"When they ate breakfast, though, Regis hoped that more information would be forthcoming, for the biscuits that this traveler had given to Drizzt were truly delicious and incredibly refreshing. After only a few bites, the halfling felt as if he had spent a week at rest.": "然而，当他们吃早餐的时候，瑞吉希望会有更多信息的传来，因为这位旅行者给狄智特的饼干真的非常美味，令人耳目一新。只吃了几口后，这位半身人感觉自己就像休息了一个星期一样。"
