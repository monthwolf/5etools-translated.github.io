	"A ballista is a massive crossbow that fires heavy bolts. Before it can be fired, it must be loaded and aimed. It takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it.": "弩炮是一种巨大的十字弓，可以发射沉重的箭矢。在发射之前，必须先装填和瞄准。装填武器需要一个动作，瞄准它需要一个动作，发射它需要一个动作。",
	"A cannon uses gunpowder to propel heavy balls of cast iron through the air at destructive speeds. In a campaign without gunpowder, a cannon might be an arcane device built by clever gnomes or wizardly engineers.": "大炮使用火药将沉重的铸铁球以破坏性的速度在空中推进。在没有火药的战役中，大炮可能是由聪明的地精或巫师工程师建造的一种神秘的装置。",
	"A cannon is usually supported in a wooden frame with wheels. Before it can be fired, the cannon must be loaded and aimed. It takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it.": "大炮通常被支撑在一个带轮子的木质框架中。在发射之前，大炮必须装填和瞄准。装填武器需要一个动作，瞄准武器需要一个动作，发射武器需要一个动作。",
	"When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire's coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character's success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.": "当角色需要锯断绳索、打碎窗户或砸碎吸血鬼的棺材时，唯一的硬性规定是：只要有足够的时间和正确的工具，角色就可以破坏任何可破坏的物体。在决定一个角色是否能成功破坏一个物体时，请使用常识。一个战士能用剑切开一段石墙吗？不能，剑很可能会在墙之前就断裂。",
	"For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.": "在这些规则中，物体是指一个离散的、无生命的物品，如窗户、门、剑、书、桌子、椅子或石头，而不是由许多其他物体组成的建筑物或车辆。",
	"When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.": "当时间是一个因素时，你可以给一个可破坏的物体分配一个装甲等级和命中率。你还可以赋予它免疫力、抵抗力和对特定类型伤害的脆弱性。",
	" An object's Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.": " 一个物体的护甲等级是衡量对该物体造成伤害的难度（因为该物体没有机会躲避）。物体护甲等级表提供了各种物质的建议AC值。",
	"Cloth, paper, rope": "布、纸、绳",
	"Crystal, glass, ice": "水晶、玻璃、冰块",

	"Stone": "石头",
	"Iron, steel": "铁、钢",
	"Mithral": "米特拉",
	"Adamantine": "金刚石",
	" An object's hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.": " 一个物体的命中率衡量它在失去其结构完整性之前能承受多少伤害。有弹性的物体比脆弱的物体有更多的击中点。大型物体也往往比小型物体有更多的命中率，除非打破物体的一小部分和打破整个物体一样有效。物体命中率表提供了对大型或小型的脆弱和有弹性物体的建议命中率。",

	"Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section's hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.": "普通的武器对许多巨大的物体没有什么用处，例如巨大的雕像、高耸的石柱或巨大的巨石。也就是说，一个火把就可以烧掉一个巨大的挂毯，一个地震法术就可以把一个巨像变成废墟。如果你愿意，你可以追踪一个巨大或巨型物体的命中率，或者你可以简单地决定这个物体能够承受多久的武器或力量。如果你追踪物体的命中率，可以把它分成大型或小型部分，分别追踪每一部分的命中率。摧毁其中一个部分可能会毁掉整个物体。例如，一个巨大的人类雕像，当它的一条大腿被降低到0命中率时，可能会翻倒。",
	"Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can't effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.": "物体对毒药和精神伤害是免疫的。你可能会决定某些伤害类型对某个特定的物体或物质比其他的更有效。例如，重击伤害对砸碎东西很有效，但对切割绳子或皮革则无效。纸质或布质物体可能容易受到火和雷电的伤害。镐头可以削掉石头，但不能有效地砍掉一棵树。一如既往，使用你的最佳判断。",
	"Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object's damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the object's hit points.": "像城堡墙壁这样的大型物体通常有额外的弹性，由伤害阈值表示。一个有伤害阈值的物体对所有的伤害都有免疫力，除非它从一次攻击或效果中受到的伤害量等于或大于它的伤害阈值，在这种情况下，它就会像平常一样受到伤害。任何未能达到或超过物体的伤害阈值的伤害都被认为是表面的，不会减少物体的命中率。",
	"Two magical fruits (evocation school) ripen on the tree each year. Each fruit resembles an apple, but it slowly extrudes from the tree like a cyst.": "每年有两个神奇的果实（唤醒派）在树上成熟。每个果实都像一个苹果，但它像囊肿一样从树上慢慢挤出。",
	"Up to a week before the winter solstice, a sickly white fruit grows. Someone who eats a quarter or more of it takes 70 necrotic damage. Each fruit has {@dice 1d4} seeds that, if planted, grow leafless woody shrubs that animate as twig blights after one year.": "在冬至前一周，会长出一种病态的白色水果。吃了四分之一或更多的人，会受到70的坏死伤害。每个果实都有{@dice 1d4}种子，如果种植的话，会长出无叶的木质灌木，一年后会以树枝枯萎的形式复活。",
	"If a humanoid is bound to the bole of the Gulthias Tree, over the next 24 hours the victim is sucked completely into the tree. Once the victim is completely absorbed into the tree, it becomes the tree's thrall, and is expelled over the course of 1 hour. The Gulthias Tree can have only four thralls at any one time. A victim's skin is rough, gray, and bark-like. A thrall is totally corrupted, becoming neutral evil. Such a creature exists only to serve the Gulthias Tree and those who tend it (such as Belak). It possesses all of its former abilities and gains the following traits:": "如果一个人形生物被捆绑在Gulthias树的树干上，在接下来的24小时内，受害者会被完全吸进树里。一旦受害者被完全吸进树里，他就会成为树的御灵，并在1小时内被驱逐出去。古尔蒂亚斯树在任何时候都只能有四个王牌。受害者的皮肤是粗糙、灰色和树皮状的。傀儡会被完全腐蚀，变成中性的邪恶。这样的生物只为服务于古尔泰亚斯之树和那些照顾它的人（如贝拉克）而存在。它拥有以前所有的能力，并获得以下特征。",

	"If the Gulthias Tree dies, the thrall dies 24 hours later.": "如果古尔蒂亚斯之树死了，王妃24小时后就会死亡。",
	"An ice troll's heart remains cold even after the troll's destruction. As long as the troll can't regenerate, its heart can be safely removed from its remains, handled, and kept. An ice troll's heart, once removed, becomes a harmless Tiny object. For the next 24 hours, the heart has the following magical properties:": "冰巨魔的心脏即使在巨魔被摧毁后仍然是冷的。只要巨魔不能再生，它的心脏就可以安全地从它的遗体中取出，处理并保存。冰巨魔的心脏一旦被取出，就会变成一个无害的Tiny物体。在接下来的24小时内，心脏有以下神奇的特性。",
	"A creature that eats the heart gains the ability to regenerate for the next 24 hours, regaining 5 hit points at the start of each of its turns. If the creature takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn. The creature dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.": "吃了心脏的生物在接下来的24小时内获得再生的能力，在每个回合开始时恢复5点生命值。如果该生物受到酸或火的伤害，这一特性在其下一回合开始时将不起作用。该生物只有在其回合开始时命中率为0并且没有再生时才会死亡。",
	"If buried in the ground under a foot or more of earth, the heart melts away and summons a blizzard like that created by the {@spell control weather} spell. It takes 10 minutes for the heart to melt and the blizzard to form. The blizzard lasts for 8 hours.": "如果埋在地下一英尺或更多的土下，心脏会融化，并召唤出像{@spell control weather}法术所产生的暴风雪。心脏融化和暴风雪的形成需要10分钟。暴风雪会持续8小时。",

	"It takes a minimum of four Medium creatures to operate a ram. Because of the gallery roof, these operators have total cover against attacks from above.": "至少需要四个中型生物来操作一个公羊。由于长廊的屋顶，这些操作者有完全的掩护，可以抵御来自上方的攻击。",
	"A siege tower is a mobile wooden structure with a beam frame and slats in its walls. Large wooden wheels or rollers allow the tower to be pushed or pulled by soldiers or beasts of burden. Medium or smaller creatures can use the siege tower to reach the top of walls up to 40 feet high. A creature in the tower has total cover from attacks outside the tower.": "攻城塔是一种可移动的木制结构，有一个梁架，墙内有板条。大的木轮或滚轮使塔可以被士兵或野兽推或拉。中等或较小的生物可以利用攻城塔到达40英尺高的墙顶。塔内的生物可以完全躲避塔外的攻击。",
	"A cauldron is an iron pot suspended so that it can be tipped easily, spilling its contents. Once emptied, a cauldron must be refilled-and its contents must usually be reheated-before it can be used again. It takes three actions to fill a cauldron and one action to tip it.": "大锅是一个悬空的铁锅，这样它就可以很容易地被翻倒，使里面的东西溢出。大锅一旦被清空，就必须重新填满，而且其内容物通常必须重新加热，才能再次使用。填充大锅需要三个动作，倾倒大锅需要一个动作。",
