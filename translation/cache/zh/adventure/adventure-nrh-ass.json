	"Restoring Harmony is a campaign that's divided into six 1st-level mini adventures for a solo player and one longer adventure for multiple players. Each mini adventure takes approximately 45 minutes to play and the final adventure takes approximately 60–90 minutes to play.": "恢复和谐》是一个活动，分为6个适合单人游戏的一级迷你冒险和一个适合多人游戏的较长的冒险。每个迷你冒险大约需要45分钟，最后的冒险大约需要60-90分钟。",

	"Ever jealous of the cheery dispositions and colorful deliciousness of the NERDS, Emo the beholder and his hired muscle, Mr. Greystone, have struck a blow against the NERDS' beloved city of Harmony. After years of searching, the nefarious duo have found the sacred Prismatic Well that gives Harmony its vibrant and fabulous colors. Now, with access to the Prismatic Well, Emo and Mr. Greystone have begun to leech the color from the city of Harmony. If they aren't stopped, the city will gradually turn gray, with everything eventually becoming black and white.": "Emo和他的雇佣兵Greystone先生一直嫉妒NERDS的快乐性格和多彩的美味，他们对NERDS所热爱的城市Harmony进行了打击。经过多年的搜寻，这对邪恶的二人组已经找到了神圣的棱镜井，它赋予了和谐城鲜艳而美妙的色彩。现在，有了进入棱镜井的机会，埃莫和格雷斯通先生开始从和谐城中吸取颜色。如果不阻止他们，这个城市将逐渐变成灰色，所有东西最终都会变成黑色和白色。",
	"To the NERDS, the colors beginning to flicker and drain out of Harmony is an unsettling mystery. What brings the colors to Harmony is an enigma to them. All they can do is hope the power comes back on and restores the vibrancy of Harmony's colors once more.": "对于NERDS来说，颜色开始闪烁并从Harmony中流失是一个令人不安的谜。是什么给和谐号带来了色彩，对他们来说是个谜。他们所能做的就是希望电力恢复，再次恢复和谐号的色彩活力。",
	"But one group knows what's up, and that group is the Lorekeeper Society—a secret society sworn to protect Harmony. The Lorekeepers know about the power of the Prismatic Well, but its true location is lost even to themselves. However, they have a way to find the well using an ancient artifact known as the Amulet of Harmony, but to activate it they need to find the six Gems of Power. Once activated, the amulet guides whoever controls it to the secret location of the Prismatic Well. But once activated, the amulet also has the power to turn off the well.": "但有一个团体知道这是怎么回事，这个团体就是传说守护者协会--一个发誓要保护和谐的秘密团体。守望者协会知道棱镜井的力量，但它的真实位置连他们自己都不知道。然而，他们有办法通过一个被称为 \"和谐护身符 \"的古老神器来找到这口井，但要激活它，他们需要找到六颗力量宝石。一旦激活，护身符会引导控制它的人到达棱镜井的秘密地点。但一旦激活，护身符也有能力关闭水井。",
	"The Gems of Power were long ago hidden away for safekeeping in dungeons, forests, and towers. No one in the Lorekeeper Society knows the details of the magical beasts and traps guarding the gems, but our heroic NERDS are more than up to the challenge of restoring Harmony!": "力量宝石很久以前就被藏在地牢、森林和塔楼里保管起来了。守望者协会中没有人知道守护宝石的魔兽和陷阱的细节，但我们英勇的NERDS足以应对恢复和谐的挑战!",
	"Due to the solo player nature of the adventures (with the exception of Adventure 7 Adventure Together), the power level of some monsters may be difficult with respect to the level of the character. You may want to present a roleplaying solution (such as making friends with the monster or tricking them) to players who are eager to rush into combat. With any encounter in this or subsequent adventures, feel free to present opportunities for unconventional solutions and alternatives to combat.": "由于冒险的单人性质（《冒险7》《一起冒险》除外），一些怪物的力量等级可能与角色的等级有一定的差距。你可能想向那些急于投入战斗的玩家提出一个角色扮演的解决方案（如与怪物交朋友或欺骗它们）。在这次或以后的冒险中遇到的任何情况，都可以自由地提出非常规的解决方案和战斗的替代方案的机会。",
	"You can also adjust the story to be more benevolent in nature, allowing automatic successes on rolls, having monsters become instant friends, or giving your player advantage on all their rolls.": "你也可以把故事调整得更仁慈一些，允许卷轴自动成功，让怪物立即成为朋友，或者让你的玩家在所有的卷轴上获得优势。",
	"In the case of an untimely death, you can have a helpful NPC (like Mr. Honeycutt) save the day and revive them, or you can have them forego death saving throws and wake up as they're being dragged someplace unpleasant.": "在意外死亡的情况下，你可以让一个有帮助的NPC（如Honeycutt先生）拯救他们并使他们复活，或者你可以让他们放弃死亡储蓄，在他们被拖到某个不愉快的地方时醒过来。",

	"All creatures or NPCs that are bolded have stat blocks, which are included at the end of the adventure along with any magic items the characters can earn.": "所有被加粗的生物或NPC都有状态块，这些状态块和角色可以获得的任何魔法物品一起被包含在冒险结束时。",
	"Whenever you're both ready, you can start the session.": "每当你们都准备好了，你们就可以开始治疗了。",
	"When everyone's ready, read the following:": "当每个人都准备好后，请阅读以下内容。",
	"You're at the gym early in the morning before the students arrive, getting in an hour of training when two tough-looking goons swagger into the room. One locks the door behind them as the other sneers at you. They have swords, and you can tell instantly that they aren't blunted for training.": "清晨，在学生们到来之前，你正在健身房里进行一个小时的训练，这时两个看起来很强硬的家伙大摇大摆地走进房间。一个人把门锁在身后，另一个人讥笑着看着你。他们有剑，你可以立即看出他们不是为了训练而变钝的。",
	"\"Time for a little candy-coated nap!\" one goon says with a gap-toothed grin.": "\"是时候睡个小觉了！\"一个歹徒笑着说。",
	"Orange can try intimidating the two toughs, but it'll be difficult as they're fairly determined to carry out their grim task. To intimidate them, Orange must make a successful DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) check followed by a successful DC 15 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to show just how powerful they are. If both checks succeed, the goons run off, leaving their swords behind.": "奥兰治可以尝试恐吓这两个强壮的人，但这将是困难的，因为他们相当坚决地要执行他们的严峻任务。为了恐吓他们，奥兰治必须成功地进行DC15魅力（{@skill Intimidation}）检查，然后再成功地进行DC15力量（{@skill Athletics}）检查，以显示他们是多么强大。如果两个检查都成功了，这些歹徒就会跑掉，把他们的剑留在后面。",
	"If Orange takes the goons alive, they won't talk or reveal who sent them unless Orange makes a successful DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) check. If Orange gets them to talk, they explain they were hired to kill Orange by a huge, shadowy man who wore a gray overcoat and spoke in an icy whisper.": "如果奥兰治活捉这些歹徒，他们不会说话，也不会透露是谁派他们来的，除非奥兰治成功地进行了DC15魅力（{@skill Intimidation}）检查。如果奥兰治让他们开口，他们会解释说他们是被一个巨大的、阴暗的人雇佣来杀奥兰治的，这个人穿着灰色的大衣，用冰冷的低语说话。",
	"If Orange gets knocked out by dropping to 0 hit points, they wake up to find Mr. Honeycutt looking over them.": "如果奥兰治被击倒，命中率降至0，他们醒来后会发现霍尼卡特先生在看他们。",
	"If Orange defeats the goons, {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} arrives just after, hoping to warn Orange of the impending fight.": "如果Orange打败了歹徒，{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}就会随后赶到，希望警告Orange即将发生的战斗。",
	"If the goons defeat Orange, Mr. Honeycutt arrives just in time to drive them off and resuscitate Orange. Either way, Mr. Honeycutt introduces himself as the leader of the secret Lorekeeper Society—the ancestral guardians of Harmony. He believes nefarious forces are at work, attempting to steal the color from Harmony and use it for their own gain, robbing the color from the world as they do so. To save Harmony, Mr. Honeycutt first needs to collect six Gems of Power, and he hopes Orange can help him get the Peach Gem.": "如果暴徒们打败了Orange，Honeycutt先生就会及时赶到，赶走他们并救活Orange。不管怎么说，霍尼卡特先生介绍说他是秘密的 \"传说守护者协会 \"的领导人--和谐的祖先守护者。他认为邪恶的力量在作祟，试图从和谐号上偷取颜色，并将其用于自己的利益，在这样做的同时从世界上掠夺颜色。为了拯救和谐，霍尼卡特先生首先需要收集六颗力量宝石，他希望橙子能帮助他得到桃子宝石。",
	"After much research, Mr. Honeycutt says he's finally ascertained where the Peach Gem is: it's hidden in a ruined mausoleum notorious for monster activity. He needs a fighter like Orange to go into the mausoleum, return the gem to the Lorekeeper Society, and help him solve the mystery of the color outages.": "经过大量的研究，Honeycutt先生说他终于确定了桃子宝石的位置：它藏在一个因怪物活动而臭名昭著的破败陵墓中。他需要一个像奥兰治一样的战士进入陵墓，把宝石还给传说中的守护者协会，并帮助他解开颜色中断之谜。",
	"If Orange agrees to help, Mr. Honeycutt offers a reward of 20 gp for the return of the gem. He also gives Orange a {@item necklace of fireballs} with one bead remaining. As he gives the item to Orange, Mr. Honeycutt says, \"I hope you never have to use this.\"": "如果Orange同意帮忙，Honeycutt先生就会为归还宝石提供20gp的奖励。他也给了Orange一个{@item necklace of fireballs}，还剩一颗珠子。当他把物品交给Orange时，Honeycutt先生说：\"我希望你永远不会用到这个。\"",
	"Deep in the forest outside of Harmony lie the ruins of a mausoleum. When Orange arrives read the following:": "在和谐城外的森林深处，有一座陵墓的废墟。当奥兰治来到这里时，请阅读以下内容。",

	"Oddly, the birds don't sing here which makes the area unnaturally quiet.": "奇怪的是，这里的鸟儿不唱歌，这让这里变得异常安静。",
	"The entrance (area M1) can be found with a quick search inside the collapsed walls of the mausoleum. Sweeping aside a thick covering of vines, Orange finds an iron-barred gate with an old, rusted padlock. Breaking the padlock requires a successful DC 12 Strength check. If Orange has a tool, like a crowbar, or uses a creative way to open the padlock, they have advantage on the check.": "在陵墓倒塌的墙壁内快速搜索，可以找到入口（M1区）。扫开厚厚的藤蔓，奥兰治发现了一扇有铁栅栏的大门，上面有一把生锈的旧挂锁。打破挂锁需要成功地进行DC12力量检查。如果奥兰治有工具，比如撬棍，或者用创造性的方法来打开挂锁，他们在检查中就有优势。",
	"All the doors in the mausoleum are made of rotting wood. They have AC 10, 8 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.": "陵墓中所有的门都是由腐烂的木头制成。他们有10点攻击力，8点命中率，对毒药和精神伤害有免疫力。",
	"The following locations are keyed to the Ruined Mausoleum map:": "以下地点是以废墟陵墓地图为关键。",
	"When Orange opens the gate, read the following.": "当奥兰治打开大门时，阅读以下内容。",
	"You see a stone staircase descending down into darkness. Thin root tendrils hang from the ceiling and the moss-covered walls glisten and drip.": "你看到一个石阶向黑暗中下降。薄薄的根卷从天花板上垂下，覆盖着苔藓的墙壁闪闪发光，滴水不漏。",
	"The gray ooze uses its False Appearance trait to blend in with the tunnel's wet stone walls. When a creature approaches within 60 feet of the gray ooze, it senses its next snack and either waits for its target to come within reach of a pseudopod or begins a slow pursuit.": "灰色渗水体使用它的假相特性，与隧道的湿石壁融为一体。当一个生物接近灰泥的60英尺范围内时，它就会感觉到下一个零食，并且要么等待目标进入假肢的范围内，要么开始缓慢地追赶。",
	"Defeating the gray ooze isn't essential to move on, but its ability to corrode metal provides a taste of what's to come deeper in the mausoleum. This encounter is an opportunity for Orange to learn about Oozes firsthand and to devise tactics against them.": "打败灰色渗出物并不是继续前进的必要条件，但它腐蚀金属的能力让人了解到陵墓深处的情况。这次遭遇对奥兰治来说是一个机会，可以让他亲身体会到Oozes，并制定出对付它们的战术。",
	"When Orange steps into this area, read the following:": "当Orange步入这个领域时，请阅读以下内容。",
	"The walls are covered with trails of slime, some of which drips on the floor and forms slick pools. Four alcoves, each with a rotted wood door, line the corridor.": "墙壁上布满了粘液的痕迹，有些粘液滴在地板上，形成滑腻的水池。走廊上有四个凹室，每个凹室都有一扇腐烂的木门。",
	"If Orange's weapons have rusted due to the encounter with the gray ooze, the fighter can loot the skeletons' shortswords.": "如果奥兰治的武器因为遇到灰色渗出物而生锈了，战士可以掠夺骷髅的短剑。",
	"The inscription reads: \"Two warriors, so great was their love, they were buried together.\"": "铭文中写道。\"两位勇士，他们的爱是如此伟大，他们被埋葬在一起\"。",
	"If Orange opens this tomb, they find a skeleton surrounded by hard candies in wax paper wrappers. The skeleton has a parchment closed with a wax seal clutched in its hand. On the parchment is the long-lost recipe for Professor Fizzwidget's famous tart and tangy candies.": "如果奥兰治打开这个坟墓，他们会发现一具骷髅被蜡纸包装的硬糖所包围。这具骷髅的手里攥着一张封着蜡封的羊皮纸。羊皮纸上是失传已久的菲兹维吉教授著名的酸甜可口的糖果的配方。",
	"The inscription reads: \"Here lies Professor Fizzwidget, inventor of sweet candy treats for all of Harmony.\"": "铭文写道： \"这里躺着的是菲兹维吉教授，他是整个和谐社会的甜蜜糖果的发明者。",
	"When Orange opens the door to this tomb, read:": "当奥兰治打开这个坟墓的门时，请阅读。",
	"Hovering in the middle of the tunnel is an assortment of trinkets, equipment, and bones. An odd, shimmering surface reveals a gelatinous form filling the passageway wall-to-wall.": "徘徊在通道中间的是各种各样的饰品、设备和骨头。一个奇怪的、闪闪发光的表面显示出一个胶状的形式，充斥着通道的墙壁。",
	"Orange has discovered a {@creature gelatinous cube} that's behaving oddly!": "橙色发现了一个行为古怪的{@creature gelatinous cube}!",
	"Even in its weakened stat, a gelatinous cube is no easy task. Hopefully, Orange uses the last bead of the necklace of fireballs to finish off the cube. If that doesn't work, have {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} arrive with four {@creature guard||guards} to help Orange defeat the cube. Have the cube attack the guards first before attacking Mr. Honeycutt or Orange.": "即使在它被削弱的状态下，一个胶状的立方体也不是一件容易的事。希望奥兰治用火球项链的最后一颗珠子来解决这个立方体。如果这不起作用，让{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}带着四个{@creature guard||guards}到达，帮助奥兰治打败立方体。在攻击霍尼科特先生或奥兰治之前，让立方体先攻击守卫。",
	"The gelatinous cube is a floor-toceiling blob. Due to its digestive issues, this one is a sickly green. Regardless, its pseudopods sweep out in search of more things to digest, slow-moving like a street sweeper. If it senses a living creature, it moves toward them at full speed and uses its Engulf action as soon as it can.": "这个胶状的立方体是一个从地板到天花板的圆球。由于它的消化系统问题，这个是一个病态的绿色。尽管如此，它的假肢还是会扫出去寻找更多的东西来消化，像扫大街一样缓慢移动。如果它感觉到了一个生物，它会全速向它们移动，并尽快使用它的吞噬行动。",
	"If Orange is engulfed, the fighter can attempt to grab items from within the gelatinous cube. Roll a {@dice d6} (rerolling duplicates) to determine what Orange retrieves from the table below:": "如果奥兰治被吞噬了，战士可以尝试从胶状的立方体中抓取物品。掷出{@dice d6}(重复掷出)来决定Orange从下面的表格中取回什么。",
	"Two metal gambling dice": "两个金属赌博骰子",
	"The Peach Gem": "桃子宝石",
	"Brass bell": "铜钟",

	"The sarcophagus and its inscriptions have been scratched off.": "石棺和其上的铭文已被刮掉。",
	"Inside the sarcophagus, the robed skeleton of the librarian lies in repose, holding a parchment across their chest. The parchment is a scroll of protection (aberrations).": "在石棺里，图书管理员的长袍骷髅静静地躺着，胸前横着一张羊皮纸。这张羊皮纸是一张保护卷轴（反常）。",
	"\"Here lies the First Librarian of the Great Library of Harmony.\"": "\"这里躺着和谐大图书馆的第一任图书管理员。\"",
	"Arriving back in Harmony, Orange is invited to meet with Mr. Honeycutt at the local tavern. On return of the Peach Gem, Mr. Honeycutt is visibly relieved. He offers Orange membership in the Lorekeeper Society and asks if Orange will help him put an end to those who'd steal the color from Harmony. He's close to figuring out who's behind the color outages and feels as if he's going to need the help of heroes to stop them.": "回到哈默尼后，奥兰治被邀请在当地酒馆与霍尼科特先生见面。在归还桃子宝石后，Honeycutt先生明显松了一口气。他向奥兰治提供了罗瑞金协会的会员资格，并询问奥兰治是否愿意帮助他结束那些从和谐城偷走颜色的人。他已接近弄清谁是颜色中断的幕后黑手，并认为他将需要英雄们的帮助来阻止他们。",
	"The following magic items appear in this adventure.": "下列魔法物品出现在这次冒险中。",
	"In solo play, there's always a chance the character can die. In the case of a single adventurer, this death results in the end of play; which isn't optimal for an afternoon of fun! One way to avoid death is to have healing readily available to the adventurer. If they're without healing, have the character find the odd {@item potion of healing} lying in a dusty crate or have them discover a special healing plant on their journey that, if eaten, puts them back to full hit points.": "在独自冒险中，角色总是有可能会死亡。对于单个冒险者，死亡会导致游戏结束；这对于一个下午的娱乐来说并不理想！避免死亡的一种方法是让冒险者随时可以获得治疗。如果他们没有治疗，可以让角色在一只灰尘飘扬的箱子中找到一个奇怪的{@item potion of healing}，或者让他们在旅途中发现一种特殊的治疗植物，如果食用，可以让他们恢复满血。",
	"Begin play in the sparring room of the Critical Strike Combat School where Orange is exercising and practicing various skills with the sword. In the training room, Orange has access to one energy drink which acts as a {@item potion of healing}.": "在关键一击格斗学校的练习室里开始游戏，橙色正在练习并用剑练习各种技能。在训练室里，橙色可以获得一种能量饮料，它的作用就像是一个{@item potion of healing}。",
	"The two {@creature goon|NRH-ASS|goons} begin swaggering up to Orange, ready for a fight. They've been sent by Mr. Graystone to capture or kill Orange.

	"If Orange gets into trouble during the fight with the goons, have a warrior from the Lorekeeper Society (a {@creature guard}) who's a former student of Orange's kick down the door and come to the rescue.": "如果橙色在与暴徒战斗时遇到麻烦，让来自传说守护者协会的一名战士（一名{@creature guard}）——橙色的前学生，踢开门来解救。",

	"Each tomb (A–D) is a 10-foot-wide, 15-foot-long room with a stone sarcophagus at the far end. Due to the slippery nature of the slime, the floors are considered {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.": "每个坟墓（A–D）是一个宽10英尺，长15英尺的房间，远端有一个石棺。由于粘液的滑腻特性，地板被认为是{@quickref difficult terrain||3}。",
