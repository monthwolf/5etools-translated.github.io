	"In the heart of the Ethereal Plane lies an ancient and mysterious city called the Radiant Citadel.

	"The adventures in {@i Journeys through the Radiant Citadel} were created by members of the Dungeons & Dragons community with connections to various real-world cultures and mythologies. Embarking on the adventures of the Radiant Citadel will expand your gaming horizons, can give your characters new perspectives, and might change the way you look at fantasy tropes and traditions. As adventures are the lens through which we explore fantastic worlds, they shape who our characters are and what they believe in. The greater the variety adventures offer, the richer our characters and, by extension, our gaming experiences.": "{@i Journeys through the Radiant Citadel}中的冒险是由龙与地下城社区的成员创造的，与各种现实世界的文化和神话有关。踏上《辐射堡垒》的冒险之旅，将拓展你的游戏视野，可以给你的角色带来新的视角，并可能改变你对奇幻故事和传统的看法。由于冒险是我们探索奇幻世界的透镜，它们塑造了我们的角色是谁以及他们相信什么。冒险提供的种类越多，我们的角色就越丰富，进而我们的游戏体验也就越丰富。",
	"From glittering night markets to undersea cities, from curse-afflicted villages to angel-ruled city-states, these adventures provide a pathway to never-before-seen lands and stories. The gates of the Radiant Citadel stand open, and a rich tapestry of stories is yours to explore.": "从闪亮的夜市到海底城市，从受诅咒影响的村庄到天使统治的城邦，这些冒险提供了一条通往从未见过的土地和故事的途径。辐射城堡的大门敞开着，丰富的故事织锦等着你去探索。",
	"The Journeys through the Radiant Citadel table summarizes the adventures in this anthology. Each adventure is designed for four to six characters of a particular level, but you can adjust it for larger or smaller groups as well as for characters of higher or lower level by making a few changes, like swapping one monster or trap for another, changing the number of foes in an encounter, or adjusting DCs to make important tasks easier or harder for the characters to accomplish.": "辐射堡垒之旅表总结了本文集中的冒险。每个冒险都是为四到六个特定级别的角色设计的，但你可以通过一些改变来调整它，以适应更大或更小的群体，以及更高或更低的角色，比如用一个怪物或陷阱换另一个，改变遭遇战中的敌人数量，或调整DC，使角色更容易或更难完成重要任务。",
	"Each adventure in this anthology is versatile, and characters might become involved in any of the following ways:": "本选集中的每一次冒险都是多变的，人物可能以下列任何一种方式参与进来。",
	"The characters have ties to the plot as detailed in the \"Character Hooks\" section in each adventure.": "这些人物与剧情有联系，详见每个冒险中的 \"人物钩子 \"部分。",

	"The {@book Monster Manual|MM} contains stat blocks for most of the creatures encountered in these adventures. When a creature's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block as a way of saying, \"Hey, DM, get this creature's stat block ready. You'll need it.\" If a stat block is new, the adventure's text tells you where to find it.": "{@book Monster Manual|MM}包含这些冒险中遇到的大多数生物的状态块。当一个生物的名字以{@b bold}类型出现时，那是一个视觉提示，指向你的状态块，是在说：\"嘿，管理员，把这个生物的状态块准备好。你会需要它的。\" 如果一个状态块是新的，冒险的文本会告诉你在哪里找到它。",
	"Each adventure in this book introduces a new location—be it a city, a nation, a region, or otherwise. Before running an adventure, review the gazetteer presented at the adventure's end. Aside from providing an overview of the people and plots in that land, each gazetteer provides cultural details useful in describing the setting and making it feel vibrant.": "本书中的每一次冒险都介绍了一个新的地点--无论是城市、国家、地区，还是其他。在进行冒险之前，请查看冒险结束时提供的地名索引。除了提供该地人民和地块的概况外，每个地名词典都提供了文化细节，有助于描述环境并使其感到充满活力。",

	"Describe everyone's features, not just those whose features are different from your own.": "描述每个人的特征，而不是只描述那些与你的特征不同的人。",
	"When describing a character's appearance, strive to detail more than just one thing and avoid descriptions based on stereotypes. The more you can say about body type, hair style and texture, skin tone, clothes, accessories, and the like, the more dimension a character has. As some societies strongly associate ethnicity with skin color, take extra care when describing characters' skin colors. Consider a range of literal descriptions, such as copper, umber, onyx, or ebony, with modifiers such as rich, lustrous, warm, or cool.": "在描述人物的外貌时，要努力详细描述，而不是只描述一件事，避免基于刻板印象的描述。你对体型、发型和质地、肤色、衣服、配饰等的描述越多，人物的形象就越立体。由于一些社会将种族与肤色紧密联系在一起，在描述人物的肤色时要格外小心。可以考虑一系列的字面描述，如铜色、乌木色、玛瑙色或乌木色，以及丰富、有光泽、温暖或凉爽等修饰语。",
	"You don't have to reveal a setting's entire culture at once. Skip details that aren't immediately relevant to characters, and reveal details as they arise. A scene in a tavern presents opportunities to introduce distinct foods, while a market trip is a great time to note varieties of dress.": "你不必一下子揭示一个环境的全部文化。跳过那些与人物没有直接关系的细节，在他们出现时揭示细节。酒馆里的场景为介绍独特的食物提供了机会，而市场旅行则是注意服装品种的好时机。",
	"Highlight what's familiar in a culture and how it's like other locations. This can help characters ground their experiences and better understand where they're visiting.": "突出一个文化中熟悉的东西，以及它与其他地方的区别。这可以帮助人物建立起他们的经验，更好地理解他们所访问的地方。",
	"Just as you don't have to breathe fire in real life to play a dragonborn in D&D, you don't need to be from the cultures that inspired the adventures in this book to play characters from them. However, take care to portray characters as three-dimensional people with relatable desires and fears.": "正如你不需要在现实生活中喷火来扮演D&D中的龙裔一样，你也不需要来自启发本书中冒险的文化来扮演其中的角色。但是，要注意把人物描绘成具有亲和力的欲望和恐惧的三维人。",
	"One person's culture isn't another's costume. If you dress up, simple outfits are best. Avoid leaning into stereotypes or clothing with real-world religious significance. Instead, focus on \"everyday wear\" from the cultures you're exploring. Don't change your skin color, alter your features, or emulate hair styles you wouldn't normally have to appear like a different real-world ethnicity. Similarly, avoid mocking real-world accents in your roleplay.": "一个人的文化并不是另一个人的服装。如果你穿上衣服，最好是简单的服装。避免倾向于刻板印象或具有现实世界宗教意义的服装。相反，专注于你正在探索的文化中的 \"日常服装\"。不要改变你的肤色，改变你的特征，或模仿你通常不会有的发型，以显得像一个不同的现实世界的民族。同样，在你的角色扮演中，避免嘲弄现实世界的口音。",
	"Against the unending mist and unseen terrors of the Ethereal Plane, the Radiant Citadel stands bright as a bastion of hope. It's a living relic of the ingenuity and collaboration of twenty-seven great civilizations. Abandoned and lost for ages, the Citadel was resurrected from its slumber and reclaimed by descendants of those societies, though some peoples remain missing. The city serves as a nexus of diplomacy and trade, a repository of histories and secrets, and a thriving sanctuary for those seeking safety or a better life.": "在虚空界无尽的迷雾和看不见的恐怖中，辐射城堡作为希望的堡垒而屹立不倒。它是27个伟大文明的聪明才智和合作的活的遗迹。被遗弃和迷失了很久的城堡从沉睡中复活，并被这些社会的后裔所夺回，尽管有些人仍然失踪。这座城市是外交和贸易的枢纽，是历史和秘密的宝库，也是那些寻求安全或更好生活的人的繁荣的避难所。",
	"The Radiant Citadel is a miracle of architecture, a floating city carved out of a single, massive fossil that snakes around a colossal gemstone shard known as the Auroral Diamond. The luminescence of the Auroral Diamond is mirrored in the constellation of fifteen structure-sized gemstones, the Concord Jewels, which orbit the city and provide transportation to the far-flung homes of the Citadel's founding civilizations. In the haze of the Ethereal Plane, the Auroral Diamond is a scintillating beacon visible from leagues away. The diamond itself seems to have moods, changing colors unpredictably, but it is always visible for wanderers lost and in need. Just beyond the city whirls a massive, ever-threatening, ethereal cyclone known as the Keening Gloom—a looming threat that's a grim reminder of the Citadel's precarious position.": "辐射堡垒是一个建筑奇迹，是一个由一块巨大的化石雕刻而成的浮动城市，该化石围绕着一个被称为极光之钻的巨大宝石碎片蜿蜒而行。极光之钻的光芒反映在由15个结构大小的宝石组成的星座上，即协和宝石，它们围绕着城市运行，为城堡的创始文明提供通往遥远家园的交通。在空灵界的阴霾中，极光钻石是一座闪烁的灯塔，从数里之外都能看到。这颗钻石本身似乎也有情绪，颜色变化无常，但对于迷路和需要帮助的流浪者来说，它总是可见的。就在城市之外，有一个巨大的、不断威胁的、被称为 \"振奋的阴霾 \"的空灵气旋在旋转，这是一个迫在眉睫的威胁，提醒着学城不稳定的地位。",
	"Heroes and paupers meet on equal footing in the Radiant Citadel. By common agreement, power and resources are equitably shared. Dignity is afforded to all, and great need is met with great aid.": "英雄和贫民在辐射堡垒中平等相遇。通过共同的协议，权力和资源被公平地分享。所有的人都享有尊严，巨大的需求得到了巨大的援助。",
	"Those familiar with the Radiant Citadel know the following details:": "熟悉辐射堡垒的人知道以下细节。",
	"The Radiant Citadel is an extraplanar refuge known for its collaborative society and ecological beauty. Local traditions of oral storytelling preserve ancestral wisdom from many worlds.": "辐射城堡是一个星外避难所，以其合作社会和生态之美而闻名。当地口述故事的传统保存了来自许多世界的祖先智慧。",
	"The majority of the Radiant Citadel's populace comes from the civilizations that govern the city. This makes the population an ethnically diverse mix of humans, dragonborn, dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings, along with a variety of other races.": "辐射堡垒的大部分人口来自管辖该城市的文明。这使得人口在种族上具有多样性，包括人类、龙裔、矮人、精灵、地精和半身人，以及其他各种种族。",
	"Common is widely known, along with dozens of other languages.": "普通话是广为人知的，还有其他几十种语言。",
	"The Radiant Citadel is a testament to a lost age of extraordinary magic and mythical beasts. The city rises from a gargantuan fossil, and every road and building has been carved from it. The Citadel is a place of beauty and wonder, with a vast array of vegetation and a multitude of sites and inhabitants.": "辐射堡垒是一个失落的时代的证明，它拥有非凡的魔法和神话般的野兽。这座城市从一块巨大的化石中升起，每条道路和建筑都是由它雕刻而成。城堡是一个美丽而神奇的地方，有大量的植被和众多的遗址和居民。",
	"The Auroral Diamond is the heart of the Radiant Citadel. A massive gemstone of unfathomable power, its life-giving magic runs through the entire city; the city's vegetation, water, light, and unique artifices depend on the Diamond.": "极光钻石是辐射城的心脏。一块巨大的宝石具有深不可测的力量，它赋予生命的魔力贯穿整个城市；城市的植被、水、光和独特的人工制品都依赖于这颗钻石。",
	"The Auroral Diamond changes color for unknown reasons. Sometimes it holds a color for an entire year, while other times it shifts twice in a single week. Rarely does it ever repeat a color. Some scholars believe each color represents the birth of a new civilization somewhere in the multiverse, and repetition of a color means the death of that civilization. Other scholars hypothesize the changing colors are a countdown to some unknown event.": "极光钻石的颜色变化原因不明。有时，它的颜色会保持一整年，而其他时候，它在一个星期内会有两次变化。它很少重复一种颜色。一些学者认为，每种颜色都代表着多元宇宙中某处新文明的诞生，而重复一种颜色则意味着该文明的死亡。其他学者则假设，颜色的变化是对某些未知事件的倒计时。",
	"The Auroral Diamond is indestructible. Whatever magic hollowed out the gemstone's center and created the {@area Preserve of the Ancestors|015|x} (described later) is unknown.": "极光钻石是不可摧毁的。不管是什么魔法掏空了宝石的中心，并创造了{@area Preserve of the Ancestors|015|x}（后面描述），都是未知的。",
	"The denizens of the Court of Whispers barter for current knowledge. Heralds, criers, bards, and griots buy and sell information from the fifteen founding civilizations active in the Citadel, as well as other lands. Skilled scouts and spies can also be hired for short-term reconnaissance or long-term infiltration. The Court is a mixed outdoor-indoor space with quiet alcoves and open plazas, and plentiful work is available here for talented adventurers.": "低语法庭的居民以物易物，换取当前的知识。传令官、传令员、吟游诗人和格里特人从活跃在城堡的15个创始文明以及其他土地上买卖信息。熟练的侦察员和间谍也可以受雇进行短期侦察或长期渗透。宫廷是一个室外和室内混合的空间，有安静的凹槽和开放的广场，有才华的冒险家可以在这里找到大量的工作。",
	"The Speakers for the Ancestors—the leaders of the Radiant Citadel—employ freelancers from the Court of Whispers to keep track of major concerns in their people's homelands, as well as potential threats to the Citadel, while the Shieldbearers of the Citadel (see the \"{@area Palace of Exile|014|x}\" section) seek information so they can identify crisis points where their operatives are needed. Even common citizens might hire folk from the Court to find missing loved ones, locate lost family treasures, or gather information on rivals.": "祖先的代言人--辐射城堡的领导人--从低语法庭雇佣自由职业者来跟踪他们人民的家乡的主要问题，以及对城堡的潜在威胁，而城堡的盾牌手（见\"{@area Palace of Exile|014|x} \"部分）则寻求信息，以便他们能够确定需要他们行动的危机点。即使是普通公民也可能雇用宫廷的人去寻找失踪的亲人，找到丢失的家庭财物，或者收集对手的信息。",
	"Powerful organizations and individuals from across the planes send agents to the Court of Whispers to collect information and do business on their behalf. Noteworthy examples include the Harpers of Abeir-Toril, Sigil's Fraternity of Order, and agents of the planes-traveling gnome fixer Vi.": "各个星球上有实力的组织和个人都会派特工到私语法庭收集信息并代表他们做生意。值得一提的例子包括Abeir-Toril的哈珀斯，Sigil的秩序兄弟会，以及各星球旅行的地精修理工维的代理人。",
	"The House of Convalescence focuses the life-giving energies of the Auroral Diamond, allowing for incredible feats of healing magic. This makes the House of Convalescence an oasis for the sick, the injured, and the desperate. It also draws clerics and healers of many traditions. Most come to serve those in need, but some seek to understand the magical properties of the place itself.": "康复之家集中了极光之钻的生命能量，使其能够发挥不可思议的治疗魔法。这使得疗养院成为病人、伤员和绝望者的绿洲。它也吸引了许多传统的神职人员和治疗师。大多数人是来为有需要的人服务的，但也有一些人寻求了解这个地方本身的魔法特性。",
	"Magic is affected in the following ways in the House of Convalescence:": "魔法在疗养院中会受到以下影响。",
	"When the spells {@spell raise dead}, {@spell resurrection}, {@spell revivify}, or {@spell true resurrection} are cast in the House of Convalescence, a diamond material component is never required.": "当在疗养院中施展{@spell raise dead}、{@spell resurrection}、{@spell revivify}或{@spell true resurrection}的法术时，从不需要钻石材料成分。",
	"When creatures would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, they instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring {@dice 2d6} hit points to a creature, a spellcaster restores 12.": "当生物通常会掷出一个或多个骰子来用法术恢复命中率时，他们反而会使用每个骰子可能的最高数字。例如，施法者不是给生物恢复{@dice 2d6}的命中率，而是恢复12。",
	"Just beyond the light of the Radiant Citadel rages the Keening Gloom, a massive ethereal cyclone. Nothing that enters the cyclone is seen again.": "就在辐射堡垒的光芒之外，Keening Gloom肆虐，这是一个巨大的空灵旋风。进入旋风的东西都不会再被看到。",
	"When explorers rediscovered the Citadel, the Keening Gloom hungrily circled the city. Its endless howl struck terror in their hearts and engulfed several adventurers. After the heroes entered the Citadel and reawakened its power, the cyclone was driven back. But in times of turmoil within the Citadel, the cyclone ominously draws closer.": "当探险家们重新发现学城的时候，震怒的阴霾贪婪地绕着城市。它无休止的嚎叫在他们心中造成了恐怖，并吞噬了几个冒险者。在英雄们进入城堡并重新唤醒它的力量后，旋风被赶了回来。但在城堡内部发生动荡的时候，旋风不祥地靠近。",
	"Scholars have studied the Keening Gloom for decades but have only theories about its nature, its connection to the Radiant Citadel, and what befalls those caught in its terrible throes. Many fear the cyclone cannot be held at bay forever.": "学者们研究Keening Gloom已经有几十年了，但对它的性质、它与辐射堡垒的联系以及那些陷入其可怕阵痛的人的遭遇只有理论。许多人担心旋风不可能永远被抑制住。",
	"The adventurers who discovered and reoccupied the Radiant Citadel were from the civilizations that founded the city long ago. Among them, several had been set on the path of adventure after conflict or disaster drove them from their homes, and the Citadel provided solace. In turn, they established the Palace of Exile to help others in need.": "发现并重新占领辐射堡垒的冒险家们来自很久以前建立这个城市的文明。在他们当中，有几个人是在冲突或灾难将他们赶出家园后走上冒险之路的，而城堡提供了慰藉。反过来，他们建立了流亡宫来帮助其他有需要的人。",
	"The palace was named in honor of Socorro the Exile, its founding leader. He was a refugee of war in the land of San Citlán, and he selected one of the most beautiful complexes in the Citadel to house the needy as they arrived. He swore that while his homeland was occupied, he would be an exile and would make his home in the Palace, alongside any others with nowhere else to go.": "这座宫殿是为了纪念流亡者索科罗而命名的，他是宫殿的创始者。他是圣西特兰土地上的战争难民，他选择了城堡中最漂亮的建筑群之一，以安置抵达的贫困者。他发誓，当他的祖国被占领时，他将成为一名流亡者，并将在皇宫里安家，与其他无处可去的人一起。",
	"The Palace of Exile has spacious living quarters with adjoining gardens and recovery centers, where refugees are cared for physically, mentally, and emotionally as they make the transition to either living in the Radiant Citadel permanently or relocating to a new land. The Palace's staff coordinate with the House of Convalescence to provide the best possible aid to the sick and wounded.": "流亡宫有宽敞的生活区，并有相邻的花园和康复中心，难民在这里得到身体、精神和情感上的照顾，因为他们要过渡到永久居住在辐射堡垒或搬迁到新的土地。宫殿的工作人员与疗养院协调，为病人和伤员提供尽可能好的援助。",
	"The Shieldbearers, the Radiant Citadel's dedicated search-and-rescue force, are headquartered at the Palace of Exile. Where there is a need, the Shieldbearers help.": "盾牌手是辐射城的专门搜救部队，总部设在流放宫。只要有需要，盾牌手就会帮忙。",
	"The Preserve of the Ancestors is a sprawling, domed wilderness cut into the heart of the Auroral Diamond. Lush vegetation grows directly out of the diamond, and the expanse is dotted with jackalberry trees, whistling thorn, and zebrawood. Insects, small birds, and the occasional hare make their home here. In the center of the Preserve is a circular, in-ground amphitheater that serves as the meeting place of the Citadel's ruling council, the Speakers for the Ancestors.": "祖先保护区是一片广阔的、圆顶的荒野，被切割在极光钻石的中心。郁郁葱葱的植被直接从钻石中生长出来，广袤的土地上点缀着越橘树、哨子刺和斑马木。昆虫、小鸟和偶尔出现的野兔在这里安家。保护区的中心是一个圆形的地下圆形剧场，它是城主统治委员会的会议场所，即祖先的发言人。",
	"While the Preserve has little indigenous wildlife—mostly birds and small mammals—a sect of druids frequently brings injured animals here to be healed and rehabilitated. The Preserve is where the druids keep animals that can no longer survive in their native habitats, creating a menagerie of rare creatures from across many worlds.": "虽然保护区没有什么本土野生动物--主要是鸟类和小型哺乳动物--但一个德鲁伊教派经常把受伤的动物带到这里来治疗和康复。保护区是德鲁伊们饲养那些不能再在其原生地生存的动物的地方，创造了一个由来自许多世界的稀有生物组成的马戏团。",
	"Encircling the Auroral Diamond, the Trade Discal is a massive marketplace designed so that the founding civilizations could trade on equitable terms. It serves the needs of cities and nations or major trading companies, rather than individual sellers or producers, which is enforced by its high taxes and fees. Large quantities of goods, such as entire herds of animals or tons of metal ore, can be transported via the Concord Jewels (described below) to the Trade Discal quickly and safely.": "围绕着极光钻石，贸易盘是一个巨大的市场，旨在使创始文明能够在公平的条件下进行贸易。它为城市和国家或主要贸易公司的需求服务，而不是为个人卖家或生产者服务，这一点通过其高额的税收和费用得以实施。大量的货物，如整群的动物或成吨的金属矿石，可以通过协和宝石（如下所述）快速而安全地运到贸易盘区。",
	"The Trade Discal is a vital outlet; if something were to happen to it, the impact would be severe for both the Radiant Citadel and the civilizations that depend on it. Adventurers are sometimes hired to oversee the transport of commodities to and from the Citadel or to negotiate on behalf of a major trading company or government. Normally this is a smooth process, but when large amounts of gold are involved, trade is never risk free.": "贸易盘是一个重要的出口；如果它出了问题，对辐射城和依赖它的文明都会产生严重影响。冒险家们有时会被雇来监督商品进出城堡的运输，或者代表主要的贸易公司或政府进行谈判。通常这是一个顺利的过程，但是当涉及到大量的黄金时，贸易从来都是没有风险的。",
	"Beyond the Radiant Citadel drift the Concord Jewels, which connect the city to its founding civilizations. Each Jewel is a building-sized vessel capable of holding hundreds of people and tons of goods. Though the Jewels take a variety of shapes, their interiors are similar. A cylindrical core holds containers for goods, including livestock. Surrounding the core is seating for passengers. The Citadel employs official operators called Clavigers to pilot the Jewels.": "在光芒四射的城堡之外，漂浮着协和宝石，它们将城市与它的创始文明联系起来。每个宝石都是一个建筑物大小的船只，能够容纳数百人和数吨货物。虽然宝石有各种不同的形状，但它们的内部结构是相似的。圆柱形的核心部分放置货物的容器，包括牲畜。环绕核心的是乘客的座位。城堡雇佣了名为Clavigers的官方操作员来驾驶宝石号。",
	"Each Concord Jewel is linked to one of the civilizations that founded the Radiant Citadel. A Jewel unerringly travels between the Radiant Citadel and the homeland of the Jewel's linked people. Even if the Jewel's people have migrated to another world on the Material Plane, the Jewel finds its way to their current home. While not in use, the Concord Jewels orbit the Radiant Citadel in an incandescent constellation. Each Jewel corresponds to one of the founding civilizations and resembles a giant gemstone of the type noted for that civilization on the Concord Jewels table. Missing civilizations and their Jewels are not listed and can be detailed as you please.": "每颗协和宝石都与创建辐射城堡的其中一个文明有关。宝石会准确无误地在辐射城堡和宝石所属民族的故乡之间旅行。即使宝石的人民已经迁移到物质世界的另一个世界，宝石也能找到他们现在的家。在不使用时，协和宝石会以白炽灯星座的形式绕着辐射堡垒运行。每颗宝石都对应着一个创始文明，并类似于Concord Jewels表上注明的该文明类型的巨大宝石。缺少的文明和它们的宝石没有被列出，可以按照你的要求进行详细说明。",

Otherwise, it rises 600 feet off the ground and hovers. A Jewel flies at a rate of 50 feet per round.": "着陆后的宝石会远离某个地点。如果宝石在辐射城堡附近，它就会移动到开放的虚无空间，并围绕城市运行。否则，它就会升到离地600英尺的地方盘旋。宝石的飞行速度为每回合50英尺。",
	"The Jewel and everything on it shifts between planes. When it does so, it teleports either to the Deep Ethereal several thousand feet away from the Radiant Citadel or to a specific site on the Material Plane in the land the Jewel is linked to. When a Jewel teleports to its linked land, it appears 600 feet above a site where it can land and hovers there. The location where a Jewel arrives is noted in the \"Setting the Adventure\" section of each of this book's adventures.": "宝石和它上面的所有东西都会在不同的位面之间转移。当它这样做时，它要么传送到离辐射城堡几千英尺远的深空，要么传送到物质世界中宝石所链接的土地上的一个特定地点。当宝石传送到它所链接的土地上时，它会出现在一个它可以降落的地方上方600英尺处，并在那里盘旋。宝石到达的地点在本书每个冒险的 \"设置冒险 \"部分都有说明。",
	"Clavigers oversee the Concord Jewels. Each Speaker for the Ancestors chooses the Clavigers for the Jewel linked to that Speaker's civilization. A dozen Clavigers are assigned to each Concord Jewel, and at least two keep watch from each Jewel as it orbits the Radiant Citadel and guide it during its travels. Clavigers not only maintain transit and trade to and from the Radiant Citadel but also serve as ambassadors from the city to the founding civilizations. Many Clavigers go on to become Speakers for the Ancestors.": "克拉维格人负责监督协和宝石。每位祖先的发言人都会为与该发言人的文明相关的宝石选择Clavigers。每颗协和宝石都有一打Clavigers，至少有两名Clavigers在每颗宝石绕着辐射城堡运行时进行监视，并在其旅行中进行指导。Clavigers不仅维护辐射城的交通和贸易，而且还充当城市与创始文明的大使。许多克拉维格人后来都成为了祖先的发言人。",
	"The Radiant Citadel is a city of immigrants. Several of the explorers who reclaimed the Citadel were refugees who escaped hardships that plagued their lands. They chose the Citadel as their home, despite its strangeness and the surreal surroundings of the Deep Ethereal, as it presented an opportunity to start anew. Most of the city's current inhabitants are descendants of the fifteen founding civilizations active in the Citadel, but all are welcome.": "辐射堡垒是一座移民城市。开垦学城的几位探险家都是难民，他们逃离了困扰他们土地的苦难。他们选择学城作为他们的家园，尽管学城很陌生，而且深空的环境也很不真实，因为它提供了一个重新开始的机会。城市目前的大部分居民是活跃在城堡的15个创始文明的后裔，但我们欢迎所有的人。",
	"Some find living in the Deep Ethereal too disquieting to stay or chafe at the confines of the Citadel. Others depart out of fear that the Keening Gloom will destroy the Citadel. Their numbers are replenished by new arrivals who seek a different life, want to study the city's lore, or find solace in the city's peace and safety. The Citadel's society is shaped by this ebb and flow. Traditions, customs, and values are a mix of old and new; while some adhere to rituals no longer followed in their homeland, others create their own novel practices.": "有些人觉得生活在虚无深渊中太令人不安了，不愿意留下来，或者对城堡的束缚感到厌烦。另一些人则是由于担心 \"振奋的阴霾 \"会摧毁城堡而离开的。他们的人数由新来的人补充，他们寻求不同的生活，想要研究城市的传说，或者在城市的和平和安全中找到慰藉。学城的社会就是在这种起伏中形成的。传统、习俗和价值观是新旧的混合体；有些人坚持他们家乡不再遵循的仪式，有些人则创造了他们自己的新做法。",
	"The Radiant Citadel's diaspora communities constantly learn and borrow from one another, creating a culture unique to the city. This evolution is displayed in the art, the clothing, the music, and—perhaps mostly vividly—the food of the city. While cantinas, tea houses, and eateries serve food and drink from specific communities, the most popular cuisines are fusion dishes like couscous infused with habanero and saffron, panela-coated fried yams, and kimchi tacos.": "辐射城的散居社区不断地相互学习和借鉴，创造了这个城市的独特文化。这种演变表现在艺术、服装、音乐和--也许最生动的是--城市的食物。虽然坎蒂纳斯（cantinas）、茶馆和餐馆提供来自特定社区的食物和饮料，但最受欢迎的美食是融合菜肴，如用哈瓦那和藏红花浸泡的库斯库斯，涂有面板的炸山药和泡菜玉米饼。",
	"Relationships between the Radiant Citadel and the founding civilizations are often shifting. The Citadel sends diplomats abroad and houses embassies from foreign governments, but this goodwill is not always reciprocated. The Citadel's uniqueness makes it a target of foreign actors who seek to exert subtle or overt control over it. At the same time, political activists, dissidents, and revolutionaries seek to exploit the city's neutrality to their advantage, even staging incursions against their home governments from the relative safety of the Citadel.": "辐射堡垒和创始文明之间的关系往往是变化不定的。城堡向国外派遣外交官，并为外国政府的大使馆提供住所，但这种善意并不总是得到回报。城堡的独特性使它成为外国行动者的目标，他们试图对它进行微妙或公开的控制。同时，政治活动家、持不同政见者和革命者试图利用这座城市的中立性为自己谋利，甚至从相对安全的城堡中发动对其本国政府的入侵。",
	"The Radiant Citadel is governed by a council known as the Speakers for the Ancestors. Each Speaker is a descendant of one of the founding civilizations currently known to the Citadel. They are chosen by their community and affirmed into office by the wise and ancient Dawn Incarnates. The Speakers for the Ancestors meet openly in the amphitheater in the center of the Preserve, and Citadel residents often watch their debates. All laws and major decisions of the city are decided by majority vote of the Speakers. Debates can become heated; because each Speaker represents very different constituents, consensus and compromises might take days or even months to reach. Those citizens of mixed ancestry or unconnected to the founding civilizations can choose a Speaker for the Ancestors to represent them. They register with the Speaker's office, and from then on, participate in future elections for that Speaker.": "辐射堡垒由一个被称为 \"祖先发言人 \"的理事会管理。每个议长都是城堡目前已知的创始文明之一的后裔。他们由他们的社区选择，并由智慧而古老的黎明化身确认上任。祖先的发言人在保护区中心的圆形剧场公开开会，城主府居民经常观看他们的辩论。城市的所有法律和重大决定都由议长们的多数票来决定。辩论可能会变得激烈；因为每个议长代表着非常不同的选民，共识和妥协可能需要几天甚至几个月的时间才能达成。那些混合血统或与创始文明无关的公民可以选择一位祖先的议长来代表他们。他们在议长办公室登记，并从那时起，参与该议长的未来选举。",
	"Governance is public, transparent, and participatory. Laws are not static but evolve to meet new challenges and needs. Subcouncils and committees manage the city under the guidance of the Speakers. Complexities persist in governing a highly diverse city with varied customs, beliefs, and social norms, but robust civic engagement helps the city overcome adversity.": "治理是公开、透明和参与性的。法律不是一成不变的，而是不断发展以满足新的挑战和需求。小组委员会和委员会在议长的指导下管理城市。治理一个具有不同习俗、信仰和社会规范的高度多元化的城市仍然存在复杂的问题，但强有力的公民参与有助于城市克服逆境。",
	"Public safety and peacekeeping are administered through a variety of councils and organizations designed to address specific issues. The House of Convalescence helps those living with mental illness, while inspectors investigate nonviolent crimes and use nonlethal methods of detainment. Theft is uncommon in the city, and rehabilitation and restorative justice are preferred methods of addressing wrongs. Highly trained local guards mobilize to handle the rare incidents of violence, and citizens are expected to proactively intervene if needed. The worst offenders are sentenced to a controversial Djaynaian punishment wherein the criminal is subjected to a ritual that prevents them from repeating their crime and then is banished from the city.": "公共安全和维持和平是通过各种旨在解决具体问题的理事会和组织来管理的。疗养院帮助那些患有精神疾病的人，而检查员则调查非暴力犯罪并使用非致命的拘留方法。盗窃行为在该市并不常见，康复和恢复性司法是处理错误的首选方法。训练有素的当地卫兵动员起来处理罕见的暴力事件，而公民则被期望在必要时主动干预。最严重的罪犯会被判处有争议的Djaynaian刑罚，在这种刑罚下，罪犯会接受一种仪式，防止他们再次犯罪，然后被驱逐出城市。",
	"Denizens of the Radiant Citadel strive to sustain an egalitarian society. Every citizen is entitled to a basic income that affords them the necessities of living and dignity in lifestyle. Food, water, and green spaces are equally accessible throughout the city. The House of Convalescence turns no one away; healing is priced according to one's means, and the poorest are served without charge. All housing is public, distributed, and administered through the city's councils.": "辐射堡垒的居民努力维持一个平等的社会。每个公民都有权获得基本的收入，使他们获得生活的必需品和生活方式的尊严。食物、水和绿地在整个城市都可以平等地获得。疗养院不拒人于千里之外；治疗是根据个人的能力来定价的，最贫穷的人可以免费获得服务。所有的住房都是公共的，分配的，并通过城市的理事会进行管理。",
	"Since the city's resources are limited due to the Citadel's relatively small area and its strange nature, foodstuffs and other materials are carefully conserved, and goods are reused or recycled when possible. Similarly, most food is vegetarian and is grown in green spaces throughout the city. Whether served in a home or an eatery, most animal products must be imported and so are subject to high tariffs.": "由于城堡的面积相对较小，加上其奇怪的性质，城市的资源是有限的，因此食品和其他材料都被小心翼翼地保存起来，货物尽可能地被重新使用或回收。同样，大多数食物都是素食，并在整个城市的绿地上种植。无论是在家里还是在餐馆里，大多数动物产品都必须进口，因此要缴纳高额关税。",
	"Taxes are progressive to help reduce the gap between the most affluent and the poorest. High tariffs on imports keep the public coffers full, but the Speakers lower or remove tariffs for civilizations in trouble. Similarly, visitors to the Radiant Citadel pay a toll to enter. Those who come with nothing except good will pay no fee. Those with big pockets and big hearts give more according to their conscience rather than risk the rebuke of the city's guards. Rich and poor alike can instead offer something unique that might be to the liking of the Incarnates, such as a lost song, a secret tale, or a rare piece of art. Those who choose this option may present their gift to the Dawn Incarnate of their choice. If their toll is accepted, the visitor is allowed to stay in the Citadel.": "税收是累进的，以帮助减少最富裕的人和最贫穷的人之间的差距。对进口商品征收的高额关税使国库充盈，但议长们对有困难的文明降低或取消关税。同样地，进入辐射城堡的游客也要支付通行费。那些除了好东西之外什么都没带的人则不需要支付任何费用。那些腰缠万贯、心胸宽广的人根据自己的良心付出更多，而不是冒着被城市守卫斥责的风险。富人和穷人都可以提供一些独特的东西，可能是化身喜欢的，如一首失落的歌曲，一个秘密的故事，或一件罕见的艺术品。选择这种方式的人可以将他们的礼物送给他们选择的黎明化身。如果他们的通行费被接受，访客就被允许留在城堡里。",
	"Several groups hold influence within the Radiant Citadel, guiding and protecting the city's peoples.": "有几个团体在辐射堡垒内拥有影响力，指导和保护该城市的人民。",
	"The keepers of vast wisdom from distant lands, the Incarnates are collections of spirits bound within gemstones. Each of an Incarnate's component gemstones holds a spirit from the same land on the Material Plane. These might be nature spirits from a particular place or the spirits of individuals who once dwelled there. Upon forming, an Incarnate manifests a unique personality and identity, a gestalt of its constituents and their shared background. The greater the number of spirits that make up an Incarnate, the broader and deeper both its personality and its knowledge are.": "化身是来自遥远国度的巨大智慧的守护者，是绑定在宝石中的精神集合。每个化身的组成宝石都有一个来自物质世界同一片土地上的精神。这些可能是某个地方的自然之灵，或者是曾经居住在那里的个人之灵。形成后，一个化身会表现出独特的个性和身份，是其组成成分及其共同背景的集合体。组成化身的灵体数量越多，其个性和知识就越广泛和深入。",
	"Most Incarnates are small, no more than a handful of gems in the shape of a plant or animal. The least of them originate from spirits lost on the Ethereal Plane and are tiny collections of wayward spirits of similar origins with nowhere else to go. The largest and most influential are those of the fifteen founding civilizations collectively known as the Dawn Incarnates. Spanning more than a dozen feet in height, these Incarnates are composed of thousands of smaller gems of the same type. Each holds court in a portion of the Preserve, such as the Amethyst Tiger's knoll or the Obsidian Eagle's aerie.": "大多数化身都很小，不超过一小撮植物或动物形状的宝石。其中最小的化身来自于迷失在虚空界的灵魂，是起源相似、无处可去的落魄灵魂的微小集合。最大和最有影响力的是那些被统称为黎明化身的15个创始文明。这些化身的高度超过十几英尺，由成千上万的同类型的小宝石组成。每个人都在保护地的某一区域开庭，如紫晶虎的小山丘或黑曜石鹰的小房间。",
	"The Dawn Incarnates have existed since the creation of the Radiant Citadel. While the Citadel's creators left behind no texts, it's believed that their collective wisdom is held by the Dawn Incarnates.": "黎明化身自辐射堡垒创建以来就一直存在。虽然学城的创造者没有留下任何文字，但人们相信他们的集体智慧由黎明化身掌握。",
	"The Dawn Incarnates know everything that transpires in the Preserve of the Ancestors, which is why they require the Speakers for the Ancestors to meet there. While they do not interfere in the day-to-day administration of the city, they hold the Speakers responsible to the duties of their office. While a Dawn Incarnate has never removed a Speaker for the Ancestors (see \"{@area Speakers for the Ancestors|026|x}\" below), it is believed they could do so if displeased.": "黎明化身知道祖先保护区内发生的一切，这就是为什么他们要求祖先的发言人在那里开会。虽然他们不干涉城市的日常管理，但他们要求议长们对其办公室的职责负责。虽然黎明化身从未撤换过祖先发言人（见下面的\"{@area Speakers for the Ancestors|026|x}\"），但人们相信，如果他们不高兴，可以这样做。",
	"Each Incarnate has a unique, amalgamated personality. Most who interact with an Incarnate interact with this primary identity. However, an Incarnate's primary personality is not a repository of its constituent spirits' knowledge; these spirits have their own thoughts and personalities. While an Incarnate broadly knows what its spirits know, a wealth of information is locked inside them. A constituent spirit within an Incarnate might be awakened by evoking the spirit's name or presenting something of significance to that spirit. Once a spirit is awakened, it takes over as the dominant personality of the Incarnate for a matter of minutes and might share its specific memories.": "每个化身都有一个独特的、混合的个性。大多数与化身互动的人都与这个主要身份互动。然而，一个化身的主要人格并不是其组成灵体的知识库；这些灵体有自己的思想和个性。虽然一个化身广泛地知道它的精神所知道的东西，但大量的信息被锁在它们里面。一个化身中的组成灵体可能会被唤醒，唤起该灵体的名字，或者向该灵体展示一些重要的东西。一旦一个精神被唤醒，它就会在几分钟内成为化身的主导人格，并可能分享其特定的记忆。",
	"A spirit knows only what it has observed. A nature spirit that inhabited a small pond might know a great deal about the fisher who visited its banks every week for fifty years, but might not know that person's name or where they lived. An ancestor spirit might know the intimate details of their family and town, but nothing about their neighbor's great-grandchildren. Each spirit is a single window into the civilization; together, an Incarnate's spirits have a wide but not infallible perspective on the history of their people.": "一个精神只知道它所观察到的东西。一个居住在小池塘里的自然之灵可能知道很多关于50年来每星期到池塘边的渔夫的事情，但可能不知道那个人的名字或他们住在哪里。一个祖先的灵魂可能知道他们的家庭和城镇的亲密细节，但对他们邻居的曾孙子却一无所知。每个精神都是了解文明的一个窗口；一个化身的精神在一起，对他们民族的历史有一个广泛但并非无懈可击的视角。",
	"An Incarnate and its constituent spirits are not malicious or duplicitous, but they do not necessarily answer questions easily or without a price. Some require the completion of a quest, while others might give a puzzle to solve. Some speak plainly; others respond in poem or parable. And some refuse to speak at all.": "一个化身及其组成的精神不是恶意的或两面派的，但他们不一定轻易回答问题或不付出代价。有的需要完成任务，有的则可能提供一个谜题来解决。有的直言不讳；有的则以诗或寓言的方式回应。而有些则根本拒绝说话。",
	"Each Dawn Incarnate that inhabits the Preserve of the Ancestors is related to a founding civilization active in the Citadel, as detailed on the Dawn Incarnates table.": "每个居住在祖先保护区的黎明化身都与活跃在城堡中的一个创始文明有关，详情见黎明化身表。",

Scholars believe it was the Dawn Incarnate of one of the Radiant Citadel's twelve lost civilizations, but all efforts to awaken it have failed. What happened to it and the eleven absent Dawn Incarnates of the other founding civilizations, none know.": "一个严峻的反常现象，一个被称为蓝宝石怀佛的死亡黎明化身，扰乱了祖先保护区的宁静。它静静地躺在那里，它的宝石已经变黑和破裂。学者们相信它是辐射城十二个失落文明之一的黎明化身，但所有唤醒它的努力都失败了。它和其他创始文明的11个缺席的黎明化身发生了什么，没有人知道。",
	"The Speakers for the Ancestors are the ruling body of the Radiant Citadel. Candidates are chosen through an election among the diaspora of the people they represent. Once a candidate has been elected, they must face the fifteen founding Dawn Incarnates and pass their tests. Some Dawn Incarnates question the candidate until they are satisfied, while others send the candidate on a quest. These trials ensure Speakers understand each of the founding civilizations of the Radiant Citadel.": "祖先的议长是辐射城堡的统治机构。候选人是通过他们所代表的侨民中的选举产生的。一旦候选人当选，他们必须面对15个创始的黎明化身，并通过他们的测试。一些黎明化身会对候选人进行提问，直到他们满意为止，而另一些人则会将候选人送去执行任务。这些测试确保演讲者了解辐射堡垒的每个创始文明。",
	"Once a Speaker for the Ancestors is chosen, they hold office for ten years. At the end of their tenure, they can step down; if they don't, they must face the same selection process again. There is no assurance a Speaker will be reelected, or if they are, that the Dawn Incarnates will approve them again.": "一旦祖先发言人被选中，他们的任期为十年。任期结束后，他们可以卸任；如果他们不卸任，他们必须再次面对同样的选拔过程。不能保证议长会再次当选，或者如果他们当选，黎明化身会再次批准他们。",
	"As founding civilizations are rediscovered and rejoin the Radiant Citadel, the council is expanded, and the new Speakers gain power equal to that of their peers.": "随着创始文明被重新发现并重新加入辐射堡垒，议会被扩大，新的议长获得了与他们的同龄人同等的权力。",
	"The Speakers for the Ancestors face incredible challenges in their role. They must maintain the internal stability of a large and diverse city and ensure its people are treated equally and fairly under the law. Simultaneously, they manage a complex relationship with the founding civilizations. The Speakers' first duty is to the Radiant Citadel, which sometimes puts them at odds with the governments of the founding civilizations, particularly in tariff disputes or major crises. Thus far, the Radiant Citadel's policy is to resolutely remain neutral in all conflicts—whether they involve the founding civilizations or otherwise. However, the Citadel seeks to rescue refugees and send humanitarian aid to the limits of its resources.": "祖先的发言人在他们的角色中面临着难以置信的挑战。他们必须维持一个大型多元化城市的内部稳定，并确保其人民在法律下得到平等和公正的对待。同时，他们还要处理与创始文明的复杂关系。议长们的首要职责是对辐射城堡负责，这有时会使他们与创始文明的政府发生冲突，特别是在关税争端或重大危机中。到目前为止，辐射城的政策是在所有的冲突中坚决保持中立--无论它们是否涉及创始文明。然而，城堡在其资源有限的情况下，寻求救援难民和发送人道主义援助。",
	"While decisions by the Speakers are made by simple majority, each Speaker has a very powerful veto that prevents them from being marginalized by political alliances.": "虽然议长的决定是由简单多数做出的，但每个议长都有非常强大的否决权，以防止他们被政治联盟边缘化。",
	"While in the Radiant Citadel, each Speaker rightfully chosen by the Radiant Citadel's people and the Dawn Incarnates can take an action to exert control over the Concord Jewels in the following ways:": "在辐射城中，每个被辐射城的人民和黎明化身正确选择的议长都可以采取行动，以下列方式对协和宝石施加控制。",
	"They can deactivate all Concord Jewels that are in orbit around the Radiant Citadel, preventing the Jewels' controls from functioning and rendering the vessels stranded.": "他们可以停用所有在辐射城堡周围轨道上的协和宝石，使宝石的控制装置无法运作，并使船只陷入困境。",
	"The Speaker who deactivated the Concord Jewels can reactivate the Jewels. (The rightful successor of a Speaker who deactivated the Concord Jewels can also take this action.)": "停用协和宝石的议长可以重新激活宝石（停用协和宝石的议长的合法继承人也可以采取这一行动）。",
	"Since every Speaker has the ability to paralyze trade and major transit to the city, they are forced to find diplomatic resolutions to disagreements. Though the use or threat of a veto might prompt furious debates and intense rivalries, eventually the Speakers for the Ancestors find solutions.": "由于每个议长都有能力瘫痪贸易和城市的主要交通，他们被迫为分歧找到外交解决方案。尽管使用或威胁使用否决权可能会引发激烈的辩论和激烈的竞争，但最终祖先的议长们还是找到了解决方案。",
	"Once a Speaker no longer holds office, they lose the powers related to their position. If a Speaker steps down before the end of their term or dies while in office, all basic necessities in the Radiant Citadel gradually cease to function. Unless a suitable replacement for that Speaker is elected and approved by the Dawn Incarnates within thirty days, plants in the Radiant Citadel stop growing, wells run dry, and lighting ceases to function. Similarly, a Speaker cannot leave the Radiant Citadel for more than thirty days before the city's basic utilities begin to fail.": "一旦议长不再任职，他们就会失去与其职位相关的权力。如果一个议长在任期结束前下台，或者在任期内死亡，辐射城堡的所有基本必需品都会逐渐停止运作。除非在三十天内选出合适的议长替代者并得到黎明化身的批准，否则辐射城堡的植物就会停止生长，水井就会干涸，照明也会停止运作。同样地，在城市的基本设施开始失效之前，议长不能离开辐射城超过三十天。",

	"Since their founding, the Shieldbearers have led the Radiant Citadel's rescue and relocation missions. Typically organized in cohorts of four to six members, they are deployed to lands in crisis. Strict rules of engagement prevent them from impacting local conditions or taking sides in a conflict; their mandate allows them only to extract those in danger and defend themselves if attacked. They are among the bravest of the Citadel, and heroes who die in service to the Shieldbearers receive the city's highest honors.": "自成立以来，盾牌手们一直领导着辐射城的救援和搬迁任务。他们通常以四到六人的队列组织，被部署到危机中的土地上。严格的交战规则使他们无法影响当地的状况或在冲突中站队；他们的任务只允许他们救出那些处于危险中的人，并在受到攻击时保护自己。他们是城堡中最勇敢的人之一，为盾牌手服务而牺牲的英雄会得到城市的最高荣誉。",
	"Shieldbearers stand ready to make the ultimate sacrifice to save the vulnerable and the defenseless. Many members adhere to a tradition of getting a ritual scar or tattoo after each successful deployment, designed to represent a pivotal moment in that quest.

The following are examples of common given names in Godsbreath:": "在Godsbreath，大多数人都只用一个名字--通常是年轻时取的绰号，而不是他们的名字--前面有一个反映他们年龄、职业或在社区中地位的尊称。那些太年轻的人可以不使用敬语，但对陌生人来说，使用礼貌性的敬语--小姐、先生、表哥--以示尊重，往往是明智的。以下是在Godsbreath常见的名字的例子。",

Starting a new life, Rosa married a man named Evaristo who helped raise Serapio. Evaristo died three months ago from a sudden illness. In truth, Evaristo was the first victim of sereno.

	"The stone-and-iron city of San Citlán stands at a confluence of ley lines, where the veil between the worlds of the living and the dead is thin. It's a place suffused with magic, where citizens commune with the dead in joyful festivals, and industrious minds create wonders of magic and technology. Despite San Citlán's rich culture and magical marvels, economic inequality is stark between the majority of its inhabitants and the wealthy landowners and technocrats who control the land's resources. These elite reap the rewards of progress with little regard for those left behind. As harsh as life can be for those in the city, the borderlands are harsher still. There, every day is a struggle to survive in the face of poverty, banditry, and drought.": "圣西特兰的铁石城市矗立在雷线的交汇处，这里的生者和死者的世界之间的面纱很薄。这是一个充满魔力的地方，市民们在欢乐的节日里与死者交流，勤劳的人们创造着魔法和技术的奇迹。尽管圣西特兰有丰富的文化和神奇的奇迹，但在大多数居民和控制土地资源的富有的地主和技术官僚之间，经济不平等是很明显的。这些精英们获得了进步的回报，却很少考虑到那些被抛弃的人。对于城市里的人来说，生活可能是残酷的，而边境地区则更加严酷。在那里，每天都要面对贫困、盗贼和干旱，为生存而挣扎。",
	"A cosmopolitan trade hub, San Citlán is home to grand plazas, vibrant markets, and countless neighborhoods competing for space against towering industrial facilities. Smokestacks rise over cobbled streets. Silence is a commodity, as hammers ring out and forge fires roar in the city's ironworks at all hours.": "作为一个世界性的贸易中心，圣西特兰拥有宏伟的广场、充满活力的市场和无数的街区，与高耸的工业设施争夺空间。烟囱耸立在鹅卵石铺成的街道上。沉默是一种商品，因为锤子在城市的钢铁厂里不分昼夜地响着，锻火在咆哮。",
	"Discontent among the common people has given rise to revolutionaries in the borderlands who are determined to fight the Trecena—the city's ruling council—to bring an end to corruption. Outrage recently reached a fever pitch as the city reels from political instability wrought by the death of a high-profile politician, Doña Estela. She was the longest-serving member of the Trecena, and rumors that magical resurrection will restore her to rule indefinitely have shattered the government's democratic facade. Discord brews among members of the Trecena, some of whom support Doña Estela's return while others vie for her coveted station.": "老百姓的不满情绪在边境地区催生了革命者，他们决心与特雷塞纳--该市的执政委员会--进行斗争，以结束腐败。最近，由于高调的政治家多纳-埃斯特拉（Doña Estela）的死亡造成的政治不稳定，该市的愤怒达到了一个热潮。她是在特雷塞纳任职时间最长的成员，而关于魔法复活将使她无限期地恢复统治的传言打破了政府的民主面子。特雷塞纳的成员之间产生了分歧，其中一些人支持多纳-埃斯特拉的回归，而另一些人则争夺她梦寐以求的职位。",

Massive industrial complexes loom over colorful homes in quaint streets and alleys.": "圣西特兰是一个充满对比的地方。奢华的豪宅让富人安居乐业，而穷人则为生存而挣扎。钱包在热闹的市场上被填满，在小酒馆和摔跤场上被掏空。在古朴的街道和小巷中，巨大的工业综合体在五颜六色的房屋上隐约可见。",
	"This verdant hill at the heart of the city is the center of power and wealth. Councilors of the Trecena try to maintain order from the towers of the Crucible Court, the city's seat of government. Within the enchanted halls of the Argent Congregation, the minds behind San Citlán's progress prepare future generations of spellcasting adepts. The base of the hill teems with monuments, temples, and extravagant estates. These wealthy neighborhoods and aristocratic circles provide the backdrop for political and social intrigue.": "这座位于城市中心的青翠小山是权力和财富的中心。特雷塞纳的议员们在城市政府所在地坩埚法庭的塔楼上努力维持秩序。在阿根特教会的魔法大厅里，圣西特兰进步背后的思想家们为未来的施法者们做准备。山脚下充斥着纪念碑、寺庙和奢华的庄园。这些富人区和贵族圈为政治和社会阴谋提供了背景。",

These are combined with many imported goods to create dishes from painstakingly prepared stews such as hominy-and-meat pozole to ubiquitous snacks like tacos.": "食物是圣西特兰的一个特别值得骄傲的地方，其人民用食物来表达他们的遗产。当地食材包括龙舌兰、豆子、仙人掌、辣椒、玉米和番茄。这些材料与许多进口商品结合在一起，创造出各种菜肴，从精心准备的炖菜，如家庭和肉的波索尔，到无处不在的小吃，如玉米饼。",
	"For city folk, many recreations relieve the pressures of daily life. Along with music and dance, ball games are a common pastime, ranging from ancient variations played with the hip to more contemporary kicking games. Wrestling evolved into its own form of theatrical entertainment: La Lucha, where luchadores don colorful masks, adopt epic personas, and battle using acrobatic maneuvers.": "对于城市人来说，许多娱乐活动可以缓解日常生活的压力。与音乐和舞蹈一起，球类游戏是一种常见的消遣方式，从古代用臀部玩的变化到更现代的踢球游戏。摔跤演变成了它自己的戏剧娱乐形式。摔跤手戴着五颜六色的面具，采用史诗般的人物形象，用杂技手法进行战斗。",
	"Worship is ingrained in city culture, and major religions have temples ranging from grandiose to quaint. \"Don't piss outside the cantina lest you soil a temple\" is a local saying that both offers etiquette advice and references the city's many centers of worship. La Catrina—believed to be death herself—is the patron spirit of the city. She is a capricious figure who wishes to be celebrated rather than feared.": "崇拜在城市文化中根深蒂固，主要宗教的寺庙从宏伟到古朴都有。\"不要在酒馆外小便，以免弄脏寺庙 \"是当地的一句谚语，它既提供了礼仪建议，又提到了城市的许多崇拜中心。La Catrina--被认为是死亡本身--是这个城市的守护神。她是一个反复无常的人物，希望被赞美而不是被恐惧。",
	"While numerous festivals are held throughout the year, the most splendid and anticipated is the Night of the Remembered, a celebration that evolved from ancient funerary rites and draws on the magic of the city. During this night, people can be visited by deceased loved ones if they honor them with an ofrenda: food and drink enjoyed in life, among other traditional offerings, presented on elaborate altars that guide souls back to the world. The days leading up to this event are marked by colorful citywide parades that display San Citlán's diverse culture.": "虽然全年都有许多节日，但最辉煌和最令人期待的是 \"追忆之夜\"，这是一个从古代丧葬仪式演变而来的庆祝活动，并借鉴了这座城市的魔力。在这个夜晚，如果人们用阿伦达（ofrenda）来纪念已故的亲人，他们就会来拜访他们：在生前享用的食物和饮料，以及其他传统的祭品，被摆在精心制作的祭坛上，引导灵魂回到这个世界。在这一活动之前的几天里，全市范围内都有丰富多彩的游行活动，展示圣西特兰的多元文化。",
	"San Citlán is governed by the Trecena, a council consisting of thirteen elected representatives.

	"In recent decades, the city has undergone significant transformations marked by great discoveries attributed to the Argent Congregation. Doña Estela, a dwarf landowner who held a seat in the Trecena for more than fifty years, was the congregation's founder and is credited with San Citlán's economic rise. However, her focus on progress and city aesthetics has drawn heavy criticism, as the majority of the populace lives in poverty. The seat of Councilor of the Foundry remains vacant following Doña Estela's recent death, as it has become clear that the oligarch intended to be resurrected to continue her rule indefinitely.": "近几十年来，这座城市经历了重大的转变，其标志是归功于阿根特教会的伟大发现。多娜-埃斯特拉（Doña Estela）是一个矮小的地主，在特雷塞纳（Trecena）担任了50多年的职务，她是该教会的创始人，被认为是圣西特兰经济崛起的功臣。然而，她对进步和城市美学的关注招致了严厉的批评，因为大多数民众生活在贫困之中。在多娜-埃斯特拉最近去世后，铸造厂理事的席位仍然空缺，因为很明显，这位寡头打算复活后无限期地继续她的统治。",

	"According to the tale of San Citlán's founding, an explorer named Citlali became lost in the valley of the Calaveras River. After wandering for days, Citlali saw an elegantly dressed skeletal figure trailing behind her, never moving too close or straying too far. She tried to flee, but the figure always caught up. When she turned and followed her pursuer instead, the skeleton led Citlali to a hidden cenote. Citlali dove in to assuage her thirst, and when she resurfaced, the skeletal figure was gone.": "根据圣西特兰的建国传说，一位名叫西特莱利的探险家在卡拉维拉斯河的山谷中迷路了。在徘徊了数日之后，西特莱利看到一个衣着优雅的骷髅头在她身后跟踪，从未走得太近或走得太远。她试图逃跑，但那个身影总是追上来。当她转身跟着追兵的时候，那个骷髅把Citlali带到了一个隐藏的岩洞。希特拉里潜入水中解渴，当她重新浮出水面时，那个骷髅头已经不见了。",
	"Observing that the area was rich in precious minerals, Citlali returned home and convinced others to join her to settle the valley north of the cenote and the mountains now known as Citlali's Rest. Citlali grew old, and the skeletal figure returned to take her, but the settlement remained. It was named in her honor, with Citlán roughly translating to \"the place near Citlali.\" People began calling the skeletal figure La Catrina for her elegant clothing.": "观察到该地区有丰富的贵重矿物，西特拉里回到家中，并说服其他人与她一起定居在仙人洞以北的山谷和现在被称为西特拉里之息的山区。希特拉里渐渐老去，骷髅头回来带走了她，但这个定居点仍然存在。人们以她的名字命名，Citlán大致翻译为 \"Citlali附近的地方\"。人们开始称这个骷髅头为La Catrina，因为她的衣服很优雅。",
	"San Citlán's history is rife with conflict. After years of failed invasions over its first century of existence, the city was overcome and occupied by a colonizing force. Colonial rule lasted for two hundred years and ended in a bloody series of conflicts called the Wars of Separation. In the aftermath, the folk of San Citlán held their first elections, finally looking forward to a time of peace. The wars have left scars, turning previously fertile lands barren and driving away the fey that once inhabited the region—some say forever.": "圣西特兰的历史充满了冲突。在其存在的第一个世纪里，经过多年失败的入侵，该城市被一支殖民势力征服并占领。殖民统治持续了两百年，并在一系列血腥的冲突中结束，这些冲突被称为 \"分离之战\"。之后，圣西特兰的民众举行了他们的第一次选举，终于盼来了一个和平的时代。战争留下了伤痕，使以前肥沃的土地变得贫瘠，并赶走了曾经居住在这个地区的精灵--有人说是永远。",

Zindanese citizens garb themselves in brightly colored costumes and feathered headdresses and indulge in feasting, song, and dance.": "津达是一座由螺旋状的大理石塔和塔楼、大学和市政厅、以及铺设在街道两旁的专业商店组成的城市。在阳台下的远处，花苑和码头上响起了劳动者的欢快笑声和歌声。一年四季，津达的广场和会客厅都充满了学者、商人和朝圣者。但在夏天的十天里，\"副业游行 \"吸引了更多的人群，因为这个城市在庆祝当地的葡萄酒贸易--特别是使津达成为最富有的城市的杰利酒。津达市民穿着色彩鲜艳的服装，戴着羽毛头饰，沉浸在盛宴、歌曲和舞蹈中。",
	"After its recent years of prosperity, a cloud has settled over the city. Political dissidents are rumored to disappear from their beds as the Silent Verse, the enforcers of the ruling Kings of Coin, stalk the streets. The newest member of the Kings of Coin, Madame Samira Arah, grows restless with ambition and regularly hires mercenaries and spies to investigate her rivals' secrets. The Bloodletters laborers' union opposes the leadership of the aristocracy at every turn. And beneath it all, the dire secret on which Zinda's prosperity was built waits to be exposed.": "在最近几年的繁荣之后，城市上空出现了一片阴云。据传，政治异见者从他们的床上消失了，因为沉默者（Silent Verse）--执政的金币国王的执法者--在街上徘徊。金币之王的最新成员，萨米拉-阿拉夫人，因野心勃勃而变得不安分，经常雇佣雇佣兵和间谍来调查她的对手的秘密。血族劳动者工会处处反对贵族的领导。而在这一切之下，津达的繁荣所依赖的可怕的秘密正等待着被揭露。",
	"Those familiar with Zinda know the following facts:": "熟悉津达的人知道以下事实。",
	"Zinda's people are known for cultivating the jeli flower, which features prominently in the annual March of Vice celebration.": "津达人以种植杰利花而闻名，杰利花在每年的 \"副业游行 \"庆祝活动中占有突出的地位。",
	"Humans make up the majority of Zinda's population and have skin tones ranging from light brown to black. Their hair grows in spiral curls; most grow it long and wear it tucked beneath a headscarf topped by a wide-brimmed hat (if married) or set in scalp-hugging braids (if unmarried). Elves and halflings are also frequently seen in Zinda, along with other nonhumans.": "人类占津达人口的大多数，其肤色从浅棕色到黑色不等。他们的头发呈螺旋状卷曲；大多数人把头发留得很长，并把它塞在头巾下面，上面戴着宽边帽（如果已婚），或扎成紧贴头皮的辫子（如果未婚）。精灵和半身人也经常出现在津达，还有其他非人类。",
	"All Zindanese citizens speak Common and N'warian. Many Zindanese also speak Draconic, since the power and wealth typically attributed to dragons are considered virtuous to the Kings of Coin.": "所有津巴布韦公民都说普通话和N'warian语。许多津巴布韦人也说龙语，因为通常归属于龙的权力和财富被认为是硬币国王的美德。",
	"In addition to its robust agricultural holdings, Zinda is home to magical universities, conservatories, museums, and other centers of the arts.": "除了其强大的农业资产，津达还拥有神奇的大学、音乐学院、博物馆和其他艺术中心。",
	"The Court of Flowers is the vibrant heart of commerce and art in Zinda. The district hosts streets lined with multiple palatial homes, towers with overflowing gardens, and museums. Performers gather here throughout the day, and merchants keep their shops open day and night. Most of the city's guilds—known in the city as trades—keep their headquarters among the district's towers. Artisans are expected to register with the headquarters of the appropriate trade and support the furthering of their craft.": "花之庭是津达市充满活力的商业和艺术中心。该区的街道两旁有多座宫殿式住宅，有花园洋溢的塔楼，还有博物馆。表演者整天聚集在这里，商人们日夜开着他们的商店。该市的大多数行会在该市被称为行业，它们的总部设在该区的塔楼中。工匠们被要求在相应的行业总部注册，并支持他们的工艺的发展。",
	"Hunched over brass cauldrons in their manor-like headquarters, members of the Covenant of Magic—an exclusive circle of traditionalist mages—preside over festivals, weddings, funerals, and similar events. Most covenant members are elderly; several have great-great-grandchildren who lead their own trades or are Kings of Coin. Their power stems less from magic and more from their far-reaching connections.": "在他们庄园式的总部里，魔法盟约的成员蜷缩在铜制的大锅前，他们是传统法师的专属圈子，主持节日、婚礼、葬礼和类似活动。大多数盟约成员都是老年人；有几个人的曾曾孙辈领导着他们自己的行业或成为钱币之王。他们的权力与其说来自于魔法，不如说来自于他们深远的关系。",
	"The bardic college of Zinda, the Elucidarium, is the extravagant home of the famous divas of Zinda. Draped in bright silk and exuberant florals, the building is made of sculpted glass set with sparkling gemstones. Inside, musicians, dancers, orators, and thespians hone their talents. In addition to these public skills, students can also study spy-craft and information brokering. Those who visit looking for training in the arts might find themselves embroiled in the machinations of ruthless social climbers.": "津达的吟游诗人学院，Elucidarium，是津达著名女歌手的奢侈之家。建筑物披着鲜艳的丝绸和旺盛的花朵，由雕刻的玻璃制成，上面镶嵌着闪亮的宝石。在里面，音乐家、舞蹈家、演说家和戏剧家都在磨练他们的才能。除了这些公共技能外，学生还可以学习间谍技术和信息中介。那些来寻找艺术培训的人可能会发现自己被卷入了无情的社会攀比者的阴谋之中。",
	"The great gardens that spread to the west of the city are the source of Zinda's wealth. Many Zindanese laborers tend the jeli flowers that grow there, living in wood-and-stone huts in the heart of the gardens. These velvety flowers were discovered several years ago and can't be successfully cultivated elsewhere. Why Zinda is the only place where jeli flowers can grow is a mystery, but this single crop now supplies the city with raw materials for wine, dye, fabric, and paper. Gardeners occasionally fall prey to wicked spirits, zombies, and green hags that lurk in the jungle beyond the city, as Zinda has no standing army to protect these outlying regions.": "蔓延到城市西部的大花园是津达的财富来源。许多津达的劳动者照料生长在那里的杰利花，住在花园中心的木石小屋中。这些天鹅绒般的花朵是几年前发现的，其他地方无法成功种植。为什么津达是唯一可以种植洁丽花的地方，这是一个谜，但这种单一的作物现在为城市提供了酒、染料、织物和纸张的原材料。园丁们偶尔会成为潜伏在城外丛林中的恶灵、僵尸和绿女巫的猎物，因为津达没有常备军来保护这些外围地区。",
	"Art, commerce, and magic fill the lives of Zinda's people and touch on every aspect of society.": "艺术、商业和魔法充满了津达人的生活，并触及社会的各个方面。",
	"Clad in aprons stained with jeli dye, Bloodletters proselytize a life free from oppression by the elite. The group's name originates from its members' desire to drain the greed from Zinda like blood from a wound. Under the leadership of Captain Adann, the group works in open defiance of the Kings of Coin. The Bloodletters' attacks upon the Court of Flowers and sabotage of the jeli gardens make the group a frequent target of the Silent Verse.": "穿着沾有杰里染料的围裙，\"血手 \"宣扬一种不受精英阶层压迫的生活。该组织的名字源于其成员希望从津达榨取贪婪，就像榨取伤口的血液一样。在队长阿丹的领导下，该组织公开蔑视币王。血手党对百花宫的攻击和对杰里花园的破坏，使该组织经常成为无声诗篇的目标。",
	"Zinda has a stark class divide. The city's wealthy citizens live in large homes and revere academia, a strong work ethic, and wealth. Members of less affluent families sleep together in cramped quarters and often hold multiple jobs to survive. The rich feast on goat, fish, and mutton; wear gold and silk; and drink from spotless glass flutes while boasting of their academic achievements and frivolously displaying magic. The poor eat grains and roots served on palm leaves spread upon straw floors.": "津达有一个鲜明的阶级分化。这个城市的富人住在大房子里，崇尚学术、强烈的职业道德和财富。不太富裕的家庭成员睡在一起，住在狭窄的房间里，为了生存，他们往往从事多种工作。富人以山羊、鱼和羊肉为食；穿金戴银；用一尘不染的玻璃笛子喝酒，同时夸耀他们的学术成就并轻率地展示魔法。穷人吃的是铺在稻草地上的棕榈叶上的谷物和草根。",
	"Though Zinda welcomes the practices of all citizens, the city's one common faith involves the daturas, also known as spirit shepherds. Daturas speak for and protect the spirits of the jungle. A datura might go years without meeting another member of the order, spending their life escorting caravans, performing exorcisms, and guarding sacred reaches of the forest. Others are hired to escort mourners to the sites of rare silk cotton trees, where the bereaved hang tokens for their recently departed ancestors. In some homes, particularly among the wealthy, whole rooms might be given over to altars intricately decorated to honor a family's ancestors.": "虽然津达欢迎所有公民的做法，但这个城市的一个共同信仰涉及达图拉，也被称为精神牧羊人。达图拉为丛林中的灵魂说话并保护这些灵魂。一个达图拉人可能几年都不会遇到其他成员，他们一生都在护送商队，执行驱魔任务，并守护森林的神圣地带。还有一些人被雇来护送送葬者到稀有的丝棉树所在地，在那里，丧亲者为他们最近离世的祖先挂上信物。在一些家庭中，特别是在富人中，整个房间都可能被布置成祭坛，以纪念一个家庭的祖先，装饰得很复杂。",
	"During the height of summer, the people of Zinda celebrate the cultivation of the jeli flower with a multiday carnival. Built on traditions celebrating the city's wine trade, the March of Vice is overseen by the Prince of Vice—an organizer and theatrical figure. Chosen by the Kings of Coin, the masked Prince of Vice marches in the parade every evening. The parade is followed by the Covenant of Magic, magic-using elders who wave fans and brooms, symbolically sweeping Zinda's sin into the sea. On the tenth night, the Prince of Vice steps into the sea and sheds their mask, bringing the festivities to a close.": "在盛夏时节，津达人用为期数天的狂欢节来庆祝杰利花的种植。在庆祝城市葡萄酒贸易的传统基础上，\"罪恶游行 \"由 \"罪恶王子 \"监督，他是一个组织者和戏剧性人物。由金币国王选出的戴着面具的罪恶王子每天晚上在游行中行进。游行之后是 \"魔法之约\"，这些使用魔法的长者挥舞着扇子和扫帚，象征性地将津达的罪恶扫入大海。第十天晚上，邪恶王子踏入大海，摘下他们的面具，为庆典画上句号。",

	"For decades, Dae Won-Ha dedicated her life to Yeonido, serving as a magistrate and protector as the city-state developed into a hub for trade. As Yeonido's population exploded after years of prosperity, Won-Ha ensured that the city was expanded with care for the wilderness, and the lower-class laborers and artisans of Yeonido reaped the benefits of the city-state's success. The common people cherished her, but the attitude of others was not so kind.": "几十年来，Dae Won-Ha将她的生命奉献给了Yeonido，在这个城邦发展成为贸易中心的过程中，她担任了行政官和保护者。经过多年的繁荣，延安岛的人口急剧增加，元夏确保城市的扩张和对荒野的照顾，延安岛的下层劳动者和工匠也从城邦的成功中获得了好处。老百姓很珍惜她，但其他人的态度就不那么友好了。",
	"In time, merchants seeking to line their pockets began to embezzle government funds. City planners accelerated expansion into the forest without care for sustainability, and the local nobility began to monopolize the benefits of the booming economy. Whenever Won-Ha protested, royal advisor Young-Gi—the brother of Queen Young-Soo—dismissed her concerns and undermined her authority. Eventually, political tensions turned the folk hero into a figure of infamy. Meanwhile, Young-Gi publicly gave Queen Young-Soo credit for all of Won-Ha's achievements, ensuring that the queen's legend would never fade, while Won-Ha was forgotten. Unable to bear the lie swallowed by her beloved people, Won-Ha grew ill and died. She passed on with no money, no clan, and no deeds credited to her name.": "随着时间的推移，寻求中饱私囊的商人开始侵吞政府资金。城市规划者加速了对森林的扩张，而没有考虑到可持续性，当地的贵族开始垄断繁荣的经济利益。每当Won-Ha提出抗议时，皇家顾问Young-Gi--Young-Soo王后的兄弟--就会驳回她的关切并破坏她的权威。最终，政治紧张局势使这位民间英雄变成了一个臭名昭著的人物。同时，英吉公开将元哈的所有成就归功于英秀王后，确保王后的传奇永不褪色，而元哈则被遗忘。由于无法忍受被她所爱的人吞下的谎言，元夏病倒了，死了。她去世时，没有钱，没有宗族，也没有事迹记在她的名下。",
	"When Queen Young-Soo died ten years ago, a monument to her was unveiled in the city's Park of the Elders. The next night, Won-Ha rose as a type of ancestral spirit called a gwishin and began haunting the monument. When no family claimed the spirit as their descendant, the city's spirit arbiters—magistrates responsible for rogue gwishin—tried to quell the angry spirit. As a former magistrate herself, though, Won-Ha's spirit managed to avoid the spirit arbiters and is growing in power.": "十年前英秀女王去世时，她的纪念碑在该市的长者公园揭幕。第二天晚上，Won-Ha作为一种被称为gwishin的祖先精神升起，开始在纪念碑上出没。当没有一个家庭声称这个灵魂是他们的后代时，城市的灵魂仲裁者--负责无赖鬼神的地方官员--试图平息愤怒的灵魂。不过，作为一名前行政官，Won-Ha的灵魂设法避开了精神仲裁者，并在不断增强力量。",

	"The curving walls of the city of Yeonido come into view. Atop the walls, tall, colorful flags and ribbons flutter from poles. Traders, guards, and workers come and go through a grand gate, passing from the surrounding farmlands into the maze of graceful structures beyond. As you watch, a pale mist rises from within the city. It drifts through the gates and breaks over the walls as if the entire city were exhaling one great breath.": "延安岛市弯曲的城墙映入眼帘。在城墙上，高大的彩色旗帜和彩带从杆子上飘扬。商人、卫兵和工人们来来往往，穿过一个宏伟的大门，从周围的农田进入迷宫般的优美建筑。当你观看时，一股淡淡的雾气从城市内部升起。它飘过城门，越过城墙，仿佛整个城市都在呼出一口大气。",
	"As the characters near the city gate, they notice the guards and other travelers are bewildered by the strange weather but do their best to ignore it or joke to hide their insecurity. If asked about the fog, locals say they've never seen anything like this.": "当人物接近城门时，他们注意到守卫和其他旅行者对奇怪的天气感到困惑，但他们尽力忽视它，或开玩笑来掩饰他们的不安全感。如果被问及大雾，当地人说他们从未见过这样的事情。",
	"The fog covering the area vanishes 1 minute after the gargoyles appear. If the gargoyles are still alive, they vanish along with the fog.": "覆盖该地区的雾在石像鬼出现后1分钟就会消失。如果石像鬼还活着，它们会和雾一起消失。",
	"As the fog fades, the guards and other locals menaced by the gargoyles look momentarily perplexed by where they are and any damage that's been done around them, but then stoically go about their business again as if nothing had happened. If asked about the fog, the monsters, or other occurrences within the fog, they react with bewilderment. Locals have had their memories altered as detailed in the \"{@area Gwishin of Dae Wong-Ha|1b1|x}\" section—but the characters aren't affected. Locals don't fixate on the characters' confusing questions or any strangeness affecting anyone nearby, as is local custom (see the \"{@area Yeonido Customs|1b4|x}\" section). The {@spell detect magic} spell reveals that locals—in fact, almost all the creatures in Yeonido—radiate an aura of enchantment magic, an effect of the curse affecting their memories. There is one exception to this.": "随着雾气的消散，受到石像鬼威胁的守卫和其他当地人对他们所处的位置和他们周围所造成的任何破坏都显得有些困惑，但随后又若无其事地继续做他们的事情。如果被问及雾、怪物或雾中的其他事件，他们的反应是迷惑不解。当地人的记忆被改变了，详见\"{@area Gwishin of Dae Wong-Ha|1b1|x} \"部分--但人物并没有受到影响。当地人不会像当地人的习惯那样，专注于人物的困惑问题或任何影响附近人的奇怪现象（见\"{@area Yeonido Customs|1b4|x} \"部分）。{@spell detect magic}法术显示，当地人--事实上，几乎所有延安岛的生物--都散发着一种魔法的光环，这是影响他们记忆的诅咒的效果。这方面有一个例外。",
	"As the characters question the locals or otherwise demonstrate that they've experienced a strange event, a local magistrate notices them. The magistrate approaches if the characters react to this scrutiny or as the characters prepare to leave the gate.": "当人物询问当地人或以其他方式表明他们经历了一个奇怪的事件时，当地的一个法官注意到了他们。如果人物对这种检查有反应，或者当人物准备离开大门时，地方官就会靠近。",
	"An official wearing a red and blue outfit embroidered with phoenix designs approaches. \"I apologize for my impertinence,\" they say, \"but I have an odd question I have to ask. Have you just suffered an unusual experience?\"": "一个穿着绣有凤凰图案的红蓝衣服的官员走过来。\"我为我的无礼道歉，\"他们说，\"但我有一个奇怪的问题要问。你是否刚刚遭受了一次不寻常的经历？\"",
	"The magistrate is Kun Ahn-Jun, the only person in Yeonido who isn't affected by Wong-Ha's curse.": "县长是Kun Ahn-Jun，是延岛唯一不受Wong-Ha诅咒影响的人。",
	"\"Please let me know how I can help. I'll do my best!\"": "\"请让我知道我可以如何帮助。我将尽力而为！\"",

	"\"I have to check to reassure myself that my work has been done right, even if I just checked.\"": "\"我必须检查，让自己放心，我的工作已经做得很好，即使我只是检查。\"",
	"Ahn-Jun is quietly distraught about the events affecting Yeonido. They can't make sense of what's happening and fear they're suffering visions or worse. If the characters claim to have seen the fog and creatures within it as well, Ahn-Jun is relieved and shares the following details with the party:": "Ahn-Jun对影响Yeonido的事件悄悄地感到不安。他们无法理解所发生的事情，担心自己遭受幻觉或更糟。如果这些人物声称他们也看到了雾和雾中的生物，安俊就会松一口气，并与大家分享以下细节。",
	"No one else in the city has seen the fog, but it's been rising and falling multiple times every day for weeks.": "城市里没有其他人看到过雾，但几周来它每天都会多次升起和降落。",

	"Ahn-Jun has tried to tell people about it but is always ignored.": "安俊曾试图告诉人们这件事，但总是被忽视。",
	"Strange monsters have slain people in the fog. Those who've witnessed the tragedies are shocked anew by the sight of bodies when the fog dissipates. The deaths are always considered accidents or bizarre but isolated incidents.": "奇怪的怪物在雾中杀了人。那些见证了这些悲剧的人在雾气消散时被尸体的景象再次震惊了。这些死亡总是被认为是意外或离奇但孤立的事件。",
	"If the characters don't already know about the city's customs, Ahn-Jun shares the details in the \"{@area Yeonido Customs|1b4|x}\" section and notes that these mores contribute to locals' willingness to overlook the strangeness afflicting the city.": "如果人物还不了解这个城市的习俗，安俊会在\"{@area Yeonido Customs|1b4|x} \"部分分享细节，并指出这些习俗有助于当地人愿意忽视困扰这个城市的怪异现象。",

	"Ahn-Jun can offer directions to all of these locations. While Ahn-Jun's job prevents them from traveling with the characters, the characters can contact the magistrate by speaking with the guards at the Seat of Dragons, the city's center of government.": "Ahn-Jun可以提供前往所有这些地点的路线。虽然Ahn-Jun的工作使他们无法与角色一起旅行，但角色可以通过与城市政府中心--龙之座的卫兵交谈来联系行政长官。",
	"The characters can explore Yeonido and visit the locations Ahn-Jun directed them to in any order.

	"The Tiger District is a relatively new part of the city and is still undergoing construction, particularly along the forested stretch being cleared to the northwest. Even though the locals don't recollect the fog and beast attacks that Wan-Ha's gwishin uses to impede their work, they're aware that accidents, vandalism, and missing workers delay construction.": "老虎区是城市中相对较新的部分，仍在进行建设，特别是沿着正在清理的西北方向的森林地带。尽管当地人不记得Wan-Ha的gwishin用来阻碍他们工作的大雾和野兽攻击，但他们知道事故、破坏行为和失踪的工人会拖延施工。",

	"The tigers discorporate into fog if defeated. They also vanish, along with the fog, 5 minutes after the fog appears. Before the last tiger vanishes, it retreats, heading toward the forest north of the construction site and a path hidden there (see the following section).": "如果被打败，老虎就会变成雾。雾出现5分钟后，它们也会和雾一起消失。在最后一只老虎消失之前，它撤退了，朝建筑工地北面的森林和一条隐藏在那里的小路走去（见下一节）。",

A faint blue flame glows within the lantern.": "这条路是由磨损的泥泞的石头铺成的，它通向森林的400英尺。它的尽头是一个岩石基座，上面有一块覆盖着苔藓的大理石板和一个简单的石灯笼。一个微弱的蓝色火焰在灯笼内闪耀。",
	"The moss on the slab can be cleared to reveal an inscription that reads \"Dae Won-Ha, Warrior for the People\" in both Common and Halri (the local language of Yeonido). Characters who succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ({@skill History}) check recognize the name as an obscure magistrate from Yeonido's past. Few others recognize the name, but Ahn-Jun does if asked (see the \"{@area Lingering Memories|1dd|x}\" section). Anyone who recognizes the name also knows it's odd that such a figure would have a shrine dedicated to them—an honor usually awarded only to heroes.": "清除石板上的青苔，可以看到一个铭文，上面用普通话和Halri（延安岛的当地语言）写着 \"Dae Won-Ha, Warrior for the People\"。成功通过DC18智力测试的人物可以认出这个名字是延安岛过去的一个不知名的地方官。很少有人能认出这个名字，但如果有人问起，安俊会认出（见\"{@area Lingering Memories|1dd|x} \"部分）。任何认识这个名字的人都知道，这样一个人物会有一个供奉他们的祠堂，这很奇怪--这种荣誉通常只颁给英雄。",
	"The lantern bears a magical flame that emits dim light for 10 feet and no heat. The {@spell detect magic} spell reveals that the candle has an aura of evocation magic. If the name Dae Won-Ha is spoken within 10 feet of the candle, it momentarily flares in intensity. The lantern also flickers if brought within 10 feet of the teacup from the Phoenix District or the amulet Young-Gi carries (see the \"Phoenix District\" and \"{@area Estate Gardens|1d2|x}\" sections). The lantern can be moved and weighs 3 pounds. If the lantern is brought before the gwishin of Dae Won-Ha in the Park of the Elders, the spirit might be convinced the people of Yeonido still remember her.": "灯笼上有一个神奇的火焰，在10英尺范围内发出昏暗的光，没有热量。{@spell detect magic}法术显示，蜡烛有一个唤起魔法的光环。如果在蜡烛的10英尺范围内说出大元帅的名字，它就会瞬间爆发出强烈的光芒。如果将灯笼带入凤凰区的茶杯或英姬携带的护身符（见 \"凤凰区 \"和\"{@area Estate Gardens|1d2|x} \"部分）的10英尺范围内，它也会闪烁。灯笼可以移动，重达3磅。如果把灯笼带到长老公园里的大元帅面前，鬼魂可能会相信延岛的人们仍然记得她。",
	"The oldest area in the city, the Phoenix District is adjacent to the royal palace known as the Seat of Dragons, and it is populated exclusively by nobles and the wealthy elite.

Chin-Hae grows taciturn if asked about the recent attack near his shop or the troubles in the city, speaking about these events only in vague terms—he doesn't want the area around his shop to be considered dangerous. A character who purchases a pot of tea for 2 sp or who succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check can convince Chin-Hae to mention that the two nobles attacked near his shop were named Nah Dae-Shim and Da Ju-Won and that they often play the game of baduk at the nearby baduk hall, a raised courtyard that's the social center of the Phoenix District.": "店主是个健谈的中性人（%0），名叫毕振海，他招呼每个进来的人，为他们准备一壶荞麦或红枣茶。如果被问及最近在他的商店附近发生的袭击事件或城市中的麻烦，Chin-Hae就会变得沉默寡言，他只用模糊的语言谈论这些事件，他不希望他的商店周围地区被认为是危险的。如果一个人物花了2英镑买了一壶茶，或者成功通过DC12魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查，就可以说服秦海提到在他的商店附近被袭击的两个贵族叫纳大沈和大朱元，他们经常在附近的巴杜厅玩巴杜游戏，巴杜厅是凤凰区的社交中心，是一个高架庭院。",

	"Neither of the nobles knows who the woman was, and they have no memory of the fog. However, if a character succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, one of the nobles reluctantly reveals they think she was a gwishin.

Her initial communication is limited to mournful statements like \"They've all forgotten me\" and \"I was nothing, I am nothing—soon they'll be nothing.\" To engage with Dae Won-Ha meaningfully, the characters must present evidence that people still remember her—particularly by showing her mementos from her life: the lantern from the Tiger District, the teacup from the Phoenix District, and the amulet Young-Gi kept safe.": "尽管被悲伤和愤怒所驱使，大元帅的桂欣还是愿意与人物交谈。她最初的交流仅限于哀伤的陈述，如 \"他们都忘了我 \"和 \"我过去什么都不是，我现在什么都不是--他们很快就会变成什么都不是\"。为了与大元帅进行有意义的交流，人物必须提出证据，证明人们仍然记得她--特别是通过向她展示她生前的纪念品：老虎区的灯笼、凤凰区的茶杯和英姬保管的护身符。",

	"If the characters speak with Dae Won-Ha's gwishin, she can tell them the information in the \"{@area Background|1ab|x}\" section.

	"Once Dae Won-Ha's gwishin is reassured that she hasn't been forgotten, the memory-affecting fog ceases to appear and the curse afflicting the people of Yeonido ends, restoring their memories. The characters might have more work to do to finally lay the gwishin to rest, such as reminding the city of Dae Won-Ha's historic role in the city's ascent to prosperity. Kun Ahn-Jun can help the characters with this and suggests restoring the magistrate's shrine outside the city and circulating records of Won-Ha's works. Ahn-Jun might also arrange a meeting with Queen Jin-Mi, who supports restoring knowledge of Dae Won-Ha's deeds.": "一旦大元帅确信她没有被遗忘，影响记忆的雾气就会停止出现，折磨延岛人民的诅咒也会结束，恢复他们的记忆。这些人物可能还有更多的工作要做，以最终让鬼神安息，比如提醒城市的大元帅在城市的繁荣中扮演的历史角色。安俊（Kun Ahn-Jun）可以在这方面帮助人物，并建议在城外修复县长的祠堂，传播元哈的作品记录。Ahn-Jun还可以安排与支持恢复大元帅事迹的Jin-Mi女王会面。",
	"If the characters don't follow through with their promise to the gwishin, the fog and mysterious attacks continue across the city.": "如果人物不履行对格瓦辛的承诺，雾和神秘的攻击就会在整个城市继续。",
	"Once the gwishin is put to rest, Ahn-Jun makes Queen Jin-Mi aware of the characters' role in saving the city. The Queen meets the characters, hailing them and Ahn-Jun as heroes and rewarding each party member with 500 gp rather than the 250 gp Ahn-Jun originally offered.": "一旦鬼神被平息，安俊就会让真美女王知道这些人物在拯救城市中的作用。女王接见了这些人物，称赞他们和安俊是英雄，并奖励每个党员500金币，而不是安俊最初提出的250金币。",
	"The people of Yeonido, the City of Judgment, pride themselves on upholding tradition. Thousands of years ago, the great dragon Mireu entrusted the founders of the city-state with a mandate to forge and lead a great civilization. Yeonido's people took the dragon's words to heart, establishing a reverence for fealty and order that has remained steadfast through the centuries. Two main beliefs form the foundation of Yeonido society: that structure is key to all things, and that adherence to familial duty trumps all but one's devotion to the royal family.": "审判之城Yeonido的人们以维护传统为荣。几千年前，伟大的龙Mireu委托这个城邦的创建者铸造和领导一个伟大的文明。延安岛的人民将龙的话语铭记于心，建立了对忠诚和秩序的敬畏，这种敬畏在几个世纪以来一直坚定不移。两个主要的信念构成了延安岛社会的基础：结构是所有事情的关键，以及对家庭责任的坚持胜过一切，但对王室的奉献除外。",
	"But those noble traditions have a troubling side: the disquieting ancestral spirits called gwishin that refuse to leave the world behind. When a citizen of Yeonido dies feeling wronged or knowing that they've harmed others, they return as one of these spirits. It's up to the spirit's family to resolve the injustice and bring peace to the gwishin, allowing it to move onward. If a gwishin is allowed to endure, it grows ever more dangerous.": "但这些高尚的传统也有令人不安的一面：被称为 \"鬼神 \"的令人不安的祖先灵魂拒绝离开这个世界。当一个延安岛的公民死后，觉得自己受了委屈，或者知道自己伤害了别人，他们就会作为这些灵魂之一回来。灵魂的家人有责任解决不公正的问题，给鬼神带来和平，让它继续前进。如果允许鬼神继续存在，它就会变得越来越危险。",
	"In recent years, some in Yeonido have begun to challenge the cultural reverence for ancient traditions, creating unease and discord. It may be no coincidence that gwishin are appearing more frequently than ever before, but it's unclear if more citizens are dying with unfinished business or if something more sinister is at work. Some even believe that the royal family has lost the trust of the great dragon Mireu. Everyone has an opinion, but no one knows how to restore harmony in Yeonido.": "近年来，延岛的一些人开始挑战对古老传统的文化敬畏，造成不安和不和谐。鬼神出现的频率比以往任何时候都高，这可能不是巧合，但目前还不清楚是否有更多的公民因未完成的事业而死亡，或者是否有更邪恶的东西在发挥作用。有些人甚至认为，皇室已经失去了大龙米雷的信任。每个人都有自己的看法，但没有人知道如何恢复延安岛的和谐。",
	"Those familiar with Yeonido typically know the following details:": "熟悉Yeonido的人通常知道以下细节。",
	"Yeonido is known for its citizens' familial loyalty and reverence for tradition, as well as for ancestral spirits called gwishin.": "延安岛以其公民的家庭忠诚和对传统的崇敬以及被称为 \"鬼神 \"的祖先精神而闻名。",
	"Humans and dragonborn are the most populous folk in Yeonido. Humans from Yeonido are primarily dark-haired and dark-eyed, and dragonborn have colorings based on their bloodlines, most commonly red or blue-green scales.": "人类和龙裔是延安岛人口最多的民族。延安岛的人类主要是黑发黑眼，而龙族则根据他们的血统拥有颜色，最常见的是红色或蓝绿色的鳞片。",
	"The city's official language is Halri, a language related to Draconic, though all citizens are also fluent in Common.": "这个城市的官方语言是Halri，一种与Draconic有关的语言，尽管所有的市民也能流利地使用普通话。",
	"The city-state of Yeonido is nestled among fertile hills and deep forests. Though many dangerous beasts dwell in those lands, farming villages surround the walled city of Yeonido itself, supporting the city and benefiting from its protection.": "延安岛城邦坐落在肥沃的山丘和深邃的森林之间。虽然在这些土地上居住着许多危险的野兽，但农业村落围绕着有围墙的延安岛城本身，支持着城市并从其保护中受益。",
	"In the center of Yeonido stands the Seat of Dragons, the palace that houses the royal family and government. The outer palace walls are a brilliant red, and the drawbridge over the moat is always open to allow citizens to enter. Important ceremonies take place in the castle courtyard, where Queen Jin-Mi can often be seen greeting her people.": "在延安岛的中心，矗立着龙之座，那是容纳王室和政府的宫殿。宫殿的外墙是鲜艳的红色，护城河上的吊桥始终开放，允许市民进入。重要的仪式在城堡的院子里举行，在那里经常可以看到Jin-Mi女王向她的人民打招呼。",
	"Though the Seat of Dragons has no magical wards protecting it, gwishin never enter the palace grounds. Some speculate that this is because the Pearl of Mireu—a legendary gift the draconic founder of Yeonido granted to its people—is hidden somewhere in the palace.": "虽然龙之座没有魔法防护装置的保护，但鬼神从不进入宫殿的场地。有些人猜测这是因为米勒之珠--传说中延安岛的龙族创始人授予其人民的礼物--被藏在宫殿的某个地方。",
	"The Yu-Ik River flows just outside Yeonido's walls and is an essential part of the city. The riverbank holds a bright community of market stalls, colorful art, traders, peddlers, tinkers, and vendors of food and drink. On official holidays, people gather along the riverbank to tie ribbons on tree branches, play games along the shore, and celebrate with good food. However, these gatherings sometimes turn ugly, with fights breaking out due to muggings and territorial disputes arising among merchants. Cautious vendors often hire guards to protect them from trouble.": "裕益河就在延岛的城墙外流淌，是这座城市的重要组成部分。河岸上有一个明亮的社区，有市场摊位、多彩的艺术、商人、小贩、工匠以及食品和饮料的小贩。在正式的节日里，人们聚集在河岸边，在树枝上系上丝带，在岸边做游戏，并以美食来庆祝。然而，这些聚会有时会变得很难看，由于抢劫和商人之间产生的领土争端而发生争吵。谨慎的小贩们常常雇用警卫来保护他们免受麻烦。",
	"Not far from the city, this cursed temple sits on a cliff above a majestic waterfall. Foolhardy children dare each other to spend the night within the forbidding temple—a challenge that has sometimes proven fatal. The temple is brilliantly painted with a thousand colors and marked with hundreds of spiritual seals. Although the site is rumored to be filled with treasures, only the most reckless thieves consider breaking in, for countless gwishin rage there each night, their screams echoing for miles.": "在离城市不远的地方，这座被诅咒的寺庙坐落在一个雄伟的瀑布上方的悬崖上。胆大的孩子们敢于在这个禁忌的寺庙里过夜，这个挑战有时被证明是致命的。这座寺庙被涂上了一千种颜色，并有数百个精神印记。虽然传闻这里充满了宝藏，但只有最鲁莽的小偷才会考虑闯入，因为每晚都有无数的鬼神在这里发怒，他们的尖叫声回荡在数英里之外。",
	"The people of Yeonido are proud of their traditions and welcoming to those who respect their ways.": "延安岛人对自己的传统感到自豪，并欢迎那些尊重他们方式的人。",
	"Yeonido's residents believe in sacrifice for the good of the community. One must work selflessly, listen to one's elders, and act according to one's status for Yeonido to prosper. Structure is the central pillar of society. Class structure and family structure are key components of life within the city. Change is possible, but usually only when it's driven by members of the royal family or the noble clans. Queen Jin-Mi sits at the apex of the social order, followed by the noble elite, the various ranks of government magistrates, and the heads of each familial clan.": "延安岛的居民相信要为社区的利益做出牺牲。一个人必须无私地工作，听从长辈的意见，并根据自己的身份行事，才能使延安岛繁荣。结构是社会的核心支柱。阶级结构和家庭结构是城市中生活的关键组成部分。改变是可能的，但通常只有在皇室成员或贵族宗族的推动下才会发生。仁美王后坐在社会秩序的顶点，其次是贵族精英、各级政府官员和各家族宗族的首领。",
	"Clans live in compounds that often hold every member of the family, organized with its own hierarchy and led by a designated elder. But clans extend beyond families, often adopting outsiders who take up permanent residence in the city-state. When people meet, they exchange clan information before personal details, and the few folk in the city who have no clan—whether they were ejected from a clan or never adopted into one—are viewed with sympathy.": "氏族居住在通常容纳家庭每个成员的院落中，有自己的等级制度，并由指定的长老领导。但宗族的范围超出了家庭，经常收养在城邦中长期居住的外来者。当人们相遇时，他们会先交换宗族信息，然后再交换个人细节，而城市中少数没有宗族的人--无论他们是被宗族驱逐还是从未被收养，都会被同情地看待。",
	"When people marry—whether for love or for social or political reasons, both of which are considered equally valid—they must choose which partner's clan they will belong to after the union. In rare cases, a new couple decides to establish their own clan, though they often face judgment from their birth clans.": "当人们结婚时--无论是出于爱情还是社会或政治原因，这两种原因都被认为是同样有效的--他们必须选择在结合后属于哪个伴侣的氏族。在极少数情况下，一对新人决定建立自己的部族，尽管他们经常面临来自其出生部族的审判。",
	"The city-state of Yeonido is ruled by the beloved Queen Jin-Mi, a dragonborn said to be descended from the city's founder and first ruler, the dragon Mireu. The bureaucracy surrounding her consists of officials known as magistrates, who govern the city-state and enforce its laws. Those who aspire to become magistrates must undergo the exams—known collectively as the Test of Ascension—that take place each spring. These tests are notoriously difficult, and typically only those wealthy enough to afford time to study and special tutoring pass. Still, many less affluent but dedicated students have used this path to change their social status. Even non-citizens are allowed to take the test if they show proper respect for the process.": "延安岛城邦由受人爱戴的Jin-Mi女王统治，她是龙裔，据说是城市的创始人和第一任统治者--龙Mireu的后代。她身边的官僚机构由被称为地方官的官员组成，他们管理着这个城市国家并执行其法律。那些有志于成为治安官的人必须接受每年春天举行的统称为升天测试的考试。这些考试是出了名的难，通常只有那些足够富裕的人能够负担得起学习和特别辅导的时间，才能通过。然而，许多不那么富裕但有奉献精神的学生已经利用这一途径改变了他们的社会地位。甚至非公民也被允许参加考试，只要他们对考试过程表现出适当的尊重。",
	"Magistrates called spirit arbiters specialize in bringing an end—peaceful or otherwise—to rogue gwishin. They investigate the appearance of these spirits, soothe them, and then attempt to right the wrongs that hold them in the world. If left with no recourse, spirit arbiters destroy gwishin, but they seek to avoid doing so. These somber magistrates are known for the traditional, broad-brimmed black hat, called a gat, that they each wear as part of their uniform.": "被称为精神仲裁者的司法官专门为流氓鬼神带来一个结局--和平的或其他方面的。他们调查这些灵魂的外观，安抚它们，然后试图纠正让它们在世界中的错误。如果无计可施，精神仲裁者会摧毁鬼神，但他们力求避免这样做。这些阴沉的法官以传统的宽边黑帽而闻名，这种帽子被称为gat，他们每个人都把它作为制服的一部分。",
	"Family comes first in Yeonido, and thus an individual's clan name is spoken before their given name. The royal family is an exception—they have no clan name, since it is expected that everyone should know them at first glance.": "在Yeonido，家庭是第一位的，因此一个人的氏族名称会在他们的名字之前被提及。王室是个例外--他们没有族名，因为大家都希望第一眼就能认识他们。",
	"Given names in Yeonido typically have two syllables. Within each clan, siblings and cousins of the same generation often share one syllable of their name. For example, a couple might have a son named Ji-Min and a daughter named Ji-Yun. The head of the clan chooses each new child's name. The following are examples of common Yeonido names:": "延安岛的名字通常有两个音节。在每个宗族中，同辈的兄弟姐妹和堂兄弟姐妹往往共用一个音节的名字。例如，一对夫妇可能有一个儿子叫智敏，一个女儿叫智云。氏族首领选择每个新孩子的名字。以下是常见的延安道名字的例子。",

	"Three great dragon siblings saw the penumbral world and descended from the heavens. The dragon Mireu gave the mortals at the Dokkaebi Mountains a divine gift—a pearl infused with the dragon's own heavenly power, which drove back the mist. Mireu's people formed the city of Yeonido, while the other two dragons established the lands of Xing and Umizu. Tales say that the Seat of Dragons in Yeonido is still home to Mireu's pearl, proof of the city's divine origins. However, if the pearl exists, its location is a secret fiercely guarded by the royal family.": "三条伟大的龙兄妹看到了这个半球形的世界，从天而降。龙Mireu给了Dokkaebi山的凡人一份神圣的礼物--一颗注入了龙自身天力的珍珠，它驱走了迷雾。Mireu的子民形成了Yeonido城，而另外两条龙则建立了Xing和Umizu的土地。传说延安岛的龙座上仍有米勒的珍珠，证明了这座城市的神圣渊源。然而，如果珍珠真的存在，它的位置是一个被皇室严密保护的秘密。",
	"The story of Yeonido's origins is often accompanied by the cautionary tale of the first gwishin. Her name has since been stricken from all records, but she was the sister of a king. Jealousy grew in her heart, and she raised her hand against her sibling. For this crime, she was struck down by Mireu, and a sickly monster appeared in her place.": "延安岛的起源故事往往伴随着第一位格维辛的警世故事。她的名字已经从所有记录中删除了，但她是一位国王的妹妹。嫉妒之心在她心中滋长，她举手反对她的兄弟姐妹。由于这一罪行，她被米勒击倒，一个病态的怪物出现在她的位置上。",

Uzoma ignores the chaos and, when the characters are ready, guides them to a young human at the crowd's edge whom she introduces as Awa—a young miner who escaped the Goldwarren. At Uzoma's prompting, Awa shares the following story:": "巨大的蝎子被打败后不久，人群就围住了辛本王子和基里纳王子，称赞他们的英雄事迹，并询问他们接下来会做什么。乌索玛没有理会这些混乱，而是在人物准备好后，引导他们到人群边缘的一个年轻人类那里，她介绍说这是阿瓦，一个从金矿区逃出来的年轻矿工。在乌索玛的提示下，阿瓦讲述了以下故事。",

	"If pressed, Awa can detail the creature that attacked him further (see the \"{@area Aurumvoraxes|245|x}\" section at the end of this adventure).

	"After Awa shares his experience, Uzoma tells the characters how King Diara has been pushing to increase output at the mine to please Empress Inaya, excavating newer tunnels so quickly there's not time to fully reinforce them. The Aurum Guild has been warning of the potential for collapses within the mine, but has been ignored.": "在阿瓦分享了他的经验之后，乌索玛告诉大家，迪亚拉国王为了取悦伊娜雅皇后，一直在推动提高矿场的产量，开凿新的隧道的速度非常快，没有时间去完全加固它们。曙光公会一直在警告矿区内有可能发生坍塌，但却被忽略了。",

	"Uzoma tasks Simbon and the characters with seeking out Kedjou, a high priest visiting Anisa Academy.

Behind a screen in the corner stands a bed, suggesting the room doubles as Kedjou's quarters.": "当辛本和这些人物到达图书馆时，一位图书管理员将他们引到图书馆顶层的凯卓的私人房间。在外面，有两个{@creature Guard||guards}人站在那里警戒。在里面，打开的书本和卷轴分布在几张桌子上，Kedjou没有努力隐藏他的任何笔记，傲慢地认为没有冒险家的流氓会理解它。角落里的屏风后面放着一张床，表明这个房间是凯卓的住所。",
	"Kedjou Kamal (neutral evil, human {@creature priest}) was raised in an orphanage run by the Acolytes of the Faceless Prophet (detailed in the \"{@area Sensa Empire Gazetteer|235|x}\" section) and has long coveted power. As high priest, Kedjou does little to combat allegations of the Acolytes' corruption—and in fact, he's behind much of that corruption. He is single-mindedly focused on securing an advisory position to Empress Inaya's heir. This mission has brought him into a pact with Kirina, Prince of Niba. The prince has offered Kedjou the position the priest seeks if he helps Kirina take the throne.": "Kedjou Kamal（中立邪恶，人类{@creature priest}）在无面先知的信徒（详见\"{@area Sensa Empire Gazetteer|235|x} \"部分）开办的孤儿院长大，长期以来一直觊觎着权力。作为大祭司，凯卓在打击圣徒的腐败指控方面做得很少--事实上，他是这些腐败的幕后推手。他一心一意地专注于为伊纳亚皇后的继承人争取一个顾问职位。这项任务使他与尼巴王子的基里纳达成了协议。王子向Kedjou提供了牧师寻求的职位，如果他帮助Kirina夺取王位的话。",
	"Kedjou expresses delight at seeing Prince Simbon and respectfully greets the characters. Characters who succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check sense animosity toward Prince Simbon.

He opposes any talk of breaking into Kedjou's quarters or harming the high priest, both of which would be scandals for Simbon's family.": "除非这些人物在城里有其他紧迫的事情，否则辛本会叫一辆马车把他们送过去。他反对任何关于闯入凯卓的住所或伤害大祭司的言论，这两件事对辛邦的家庭来说都是丑闻。",

	"The Sensa Empire runs on gold. Its three principal city-states—Anisa, Niba, and Tarikh—were each built around gold mines, and as their wealth has grown, so has their population, influence, and foreign trade. Most of the empire is arid and difficult to cultivate, so the regions between the city-states are sparsely inhabited and often lack the resources available in cosmopolitan areas. Still, the city-states and the outlands are tied together by Empress Inaya's rule, with each city governed autonomously by a hereditary monarch subject to the empress's ultimate authority.": "森萨帝国以黄金为生。它的三个主要城邦--阿尼萨（Anisa）、尼巴（Niba）和塔里克（Tarikh）--都是围绕金矿建立的，随着他们财富的增长，他们的人口、影响力和对外贸易也随之增长。帝国的大部分地区都很干旱，难以耕种，所以城邦之间的地区人烟稀少，往往缺乏国际大都市的资源。不过，城邦和外域还是被伊纳亚皇后的统治联系在一起，每个城市都由一个世袭的君主自主管理，并服从皇后的最终权威。",

Politically, the city has enjoyed years of peace under King Diara's rule, but many dread his inevitable retirement.

	"The Gate of Illumination is a centuries-old shrine consecrated to the gods of nature, fire, and renewal. It's cut into the slope of the Jademount volcano and tunnels to the lake of magma within the caldera. The slopes of Jademount are steep and treacherous to climb, making passage through the shrine the most direct route to the volcano's interior. Traditionally, offerings of flowers, fruits, and crafts are brought here and to similar shrines to thank the gods for their bounty, as the volcanic pools are viewed as passages to the gods' realm.": "光明之门是一个有数百年历史的圣地，被献给自然、火和新生之神。它被开凿在杰德蒙火山的山坡上，通过隧道通往火山口内的岩浆湖。杰德蒙的山坡很陡峭，难以攀登，因此通过神殿是通往火山内部的最直接路线。传统上，人们将鲜花、水果和工艺品等祭品带到这里和类似的神社，以感谢神灵的恩赐，因为火山池被视为通往神灵领域的通道。",

	"Through convincing roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 20 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, a character can talk Izel out of his plans and persuade him to send his salamander allies away.

Therefore, Tletepecs make great efforts to sustain the common culture and values that unite them, embodying that culture in their food and festivals. Spicy dishes are a specialty; the hotter the feeling on the tongue, the more delicious the food is considered. Peppers appear in every meal in a variety of forms. Festivals often feature turkey covered in molli, a thick, sweet-spicy sauce made from a mix of peppers, seeds, and cacao. Most Tletepecs have a sweet tooth, especially if it involves cacao. Regional candy combines the sweet and spicy flavors of local fruits, and Tletepecs enjoy watching foreigners react to these unique tastes.": "特莱特佩克人在这片土地上的许多火山附近建起了村庄，但村庄之间的旅行可能具有挑战性，因为连接这些村庄的土路经常移动或被阻断。因此，Tletepec人努力维持将他们团结在一起的共同文化和价值观，在他们的食物和节日中体现这种文化。辣味菜肴是一种特色；舌头上的感觉越辣，就认为食物越美味。辣椒以各种形式出现在每一餐中。节日里，火鸡经常被覆盖在Molli上，这是一种由辣椒、种子和可可混合制成的浓稠、甜辣的酱。大多数特莱佩克人都喜欢吃甜食，尤其是涉及可可的时候。地区性的糖果结合了当地水果的甜和辣的味道，特雷特佩克人喜欢看外国人对这些独特口味的反应。",
	"Each Tletepec village is ruled by a rotating assembly, a group of five rulers led by an assembly chief. The chief is chosen through a series of trials that vary from village to village, ranging from tests of knowledge to trials of physical prowess.

	"Offerings are an integral part of life and religious celebrations in Tletepec. Twice a year, every village assembles a communal offering to the gods to request blessings, chief among them protection from disaster. The gathered offerings are carried by a caravan of walkers and wagons to a shrine at the nearest volcano, accompanied by a priest to perform the offering. Villagers with individual requests might follow the caravan to make their own offerings. These offerings—typically consisting of foodstuffs and colorful crafts—are dropped into the volcano, where it's believed they're conveyed to the realms of the gods.": "祭品是特莱佩克生活和宗教庆祝活动的一个组成部分。每年两次，每个村子都会集合起来向神灵献祭，请求保佑，其中最主要的是保护他们免遭灾难。集合的祭品由一队步行者和马车运到最近的火山神庙，由牧师陪同进行祭祀。有个人要求的村民可能会跟随大篷车去做自己的祭品。这些祭品--通常包括食品和五颜六色的工艺品--被扔进火山，人们相信它们会被送到神的领域里。",

Tippuri citizens—a majority of them dwarves and halflings—are adept at climbing steep paths, traversing unstable rope bridges, fishing in mountain rapids, and exploring the inaccessible caves of the mountains. The city is known for its hill crops—particularly tea and timber. Locals take pride in their staunch courage and infuriating stubbornness in equal measure.": "蒂普瑞卡市矗立在乔尔塔拉河从阿达默鲁山流向深谷的地方，河水泛着白水激流的泡沫。蒂普瑞的市民--其中大部分是矮人和半身人--善于攀登陡峭的小路，穿越不稳定的绳桥，在山间激流中捕鱼，并探索山中难以到达的洞穴。这座城市以其山地作物而闻名，特别是茶叶和木材。当地人以他们坚定的勇气和令人气愤的固执为荣。",

On the last day of that year's Shankha Trials, the city simply vanished, along with everyone there. A few survivors who were just outside the city at the time told of a towering wave along the Adirohit River that marked its demise; subsequent attempts to reach its former location found nothing but endless swamps. Citizens who were away from home were left stranded. Those survivors and their descendants assimilated into the other cities, bringing Manivarsha's traditions of gem-cutting and jewel-setting to their new homes. This jewelry is now common throughout the land, and many pieces are fantastically valuable.": "五百年前，马尼瓦尔沙城邦被摧毁了，当时的情况从未被完全解释。在那年Shankha审判的最后一天，这座城市和那里的所有人都消失了。当时在城外的几个幸存者告诉我们，沿着阿迪罗希特河出现的高耸的波浪标志着它的消亡；随后试图到达它以前的位置时，除了无尽的沼泽，什么都没有发现。离家在外的公民被搁浅了。那些幸存者和他们的后代被其他城市同化，把马尼瓦沙的宝石切割和珠宝镶嵌的传统带到了他们的新家。这种珠宝现在在整个土地上都很常见，而且许多作品都非常有价值。",

	"The shell of the conch mollusk, known locally as a shankha, is the eponymous icon of Shankhabhumi. The sizable Riverine's Shankha is the legendary shell trophy that circulates among the cities via the Shankha Trials, kept at the riverine temple in the current champion's city until that city hosts the next trials.

	"The ancestors of the people of Shankhabhumi migrated here from other lands about a thousand years ago. They arrived to find swamp forests infested with monsters and other dangers—a land shaped by hundreds of riverines who were indifferent to the newcomers and their fates. Then the elven leader Kubjhatika killed a giant mollusk that attacked her people. After the battle, she carved the tale of her victory and her people's journey on a beautiful, red-ridged shell. This shell became the Riverine's Shankha. Kubjhatika offered it as tribute to the riverines, appealing to them for refuge amid the unforgiving land.": "大约一千年前，Shankhabhumi人的祖先从其他地方迁移到这里。他们来到这里，发现沼泽森林中充斥着怪物和其他危险--这块土地由数百名对新来者和他们的命运漠不关心的河流人塑造而成。然后，精灵领袖库比哈提卡杀死了一只攻击她的人民的巨大软体动物。战斗结束后，她把她的胜利和她的人民的旅程的故事刻在一个美丽的、有红脊的贝壳上。这个贝壳成了河湾人的Shankha。库比哈提卡把它作为贡品献给了河流人，呼吁他们在无情的土地上寻求庇护。",
	"The four greatest riverines—Adirohit, Iravati, Mehul, and Joltara—each wished to claim the Riverine's Shankha as their own. Kubjhatika proposed the Shankha Trials to ensure it would circulate fairly. But since people who could barely survive in this unstable land couldn't put on such a spectacular event, Kubjhatika persuaded the riverines to each create a site for a great city. Thus, the riverines created the stable islands on which Manivarsha, Sagorpur, Ashwadhatu, and Tippurika would be built, and the histories of those great cities began.": "四个最伟大的河间人--阿迪罗希特、伊拉瓦蒂、梅胡尔和乔塔拉--都希望将河间的香卡据为己有。库比哈提卡提议进行Shankha审判，以确保它能公平流通。但由于在这片不稳定的土地上勉强生存的人们无法举办如此壮观的活动，库比哈提卡说服河间人各自创建一个伟大城市的地点。因此，河民们创造了稳定的岛屿，马尼瓦尔沙、萨戈普尔、阿什瓦达图和蒂普里卡将在这些岛屿上建造，而这些伟大城市的历史也开始了。",

The skybridges are the safest way to travel between many islands, high above the whirlpools that churn in the sea below.

Powerful clans and the mercantile ventures regularly hire adventurers for trade excursions and exploration—such as journeys to the island of Lambakluha.": "卡拉邦是马拉布拉克岛上最大的社区，矗立在青翠的田野中。这个城市是一个新旧交融的地方，古老的宗教场所和外国统治的遗迹与寻求安全的商人和移民所建造的较新的建筑并存。卡拉邦对外国人持欢迎态度，并鼓励游客。有权势的部族和商业企业经常雇用冒险家进行贸易考察和探索--例如前往兰巴克鲁哈岛的旅行。",
	"The island of Lambakluha is known as the \"Vale of Tears\" in Snakesong. It was once the holiest place in Dayawlongon, home to Bathalang Puno, a temple city nestled within the roots of a colossal banyan tree that shared the city's name. That great tree was said to be where islanders' souls went after death. Some of these souls transcended into ninunos—dryad-like spirits of the land who serve as stewards to the gods and resided in the surrounding lands. Colonizing invaders burned the great tree and razed Bathalang Puno, killing untold people and spirits alike. In the aftermath, Lambakluha became a cursed place, where spirits seethe in the land, spreading corruption across the island.": "兰巴克鲁哈岛在蛇城被称为 \"泪谷\"。它曾经是达亚瓦隆最神圣的地方，是巴塔朗普诺的故乡，是一座坐落在与该城市同名的巨大榕树根部的寺庙城市。据说，这棵大树是岛民死后灵魂的归宿。这些灵魂中的一些人超越了ninunos--类似于土地上的干尸的灵魂，作为神的管家，居住在周围的土地上。殖民侵略者烧毁了大树，夷平了巴萨朗普诺，杀死了无数的人和灵魂。事后，兰巴克鲁哈成了一个被诅咒的地方，神灵们在这片土地上沸腾，将腐败蔓延到整个岛屿。",

Travelers are common, and the most traveled skybridges hold small communities where they can rest and resupply.

In the ancient past, bonesingers oversaw the final rites when great bakunawa died, then infused the creatures' bones into the magical bridges that unite Dayawlongon as one land. During the days of the first colonial incursions, bonesingers became Dayawlongon's earliest freedom fighters, but their victories came at a great cost.

The death of a binukot can result in the loss of generations of history, as Dayawlongo tradition eschews writing stories or songs down. Bonesingers maintain that bakunawa are among the greatest binukots, their vast memories making them bearers of ancient truths.": "古老的信仰指出，达亚夫隆贡的所有生命都是由一位被称为Kamatayang-Langit的诗人女神的话语所产生的，而人们对诗歌和歌曲的深深敬意也来自于此。这就是为什么每个社区都有一个或多个binukots，即作为艺术、文化、习俗和法律的活宝的吟游诗人。binukot的死亡会导致几代人的历史流失，因为达亚瓦隆戈的传统是不把故事或歌曲写下来。骨头歌手认为巴库纳瓦是最伟大的binukots之一，他们庞大的记忆使他们成为古代真理的传承者。",

The angel then provides directions to the nearby Ruz Bazaar.": "如果角色们同意Artavazda的任务，天使会解释说光明卫士在早上的袭击后检查了集市，但没有学到什么。阿尔塔瓦兹达要求角色们进一步调查，以确定灰烬继承者们在寻求什么魔法，了解他们打算如何使用它，并结束他们的威胁--最好是将他们的神秘领袖绳之以法。然后，天使提供了去附近的鲁兹集市的方向。",
	"The Ruz Bazaar is a sprawling market as old as the city. The Ashen Heirs have been searching the bazaar recently, seeking a magic samovar.

	"If the characters ask Artavazda for more information, the pari admits to working with vague information about the Silent Roar but insists the Brightguard is dedicated to keeping the people of Akharin Sangar safe from reckless revolutionaries, especially during Shabe Taabaan.

	"If, during this conversation, the characters sever ties with the Brightguard in favor of helping the Silent Roar, Artavazda is clearly wounded and flies away rather than immediately acting against the characters; Laleh contacts the characters with an invitation to the Twilight Rose soon after.

A character without an invitation can persuade the guards to let the party pass by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Deception} or {@skill Persuasion}) check. Mentioning Laleh or showing goods from the Ghorbani Bakery grants a character advantage on this check.

She's recently learned that Afsoun is still in Brightguard custody, being kept at a magical holding facility known as the Pedestal of Judgment, several miles outside the city. Laleh is eager to enlist the characters in a plan to save Afsoun.": "不管这些人物来剧院的原因是什么，拉莱称赞这些人物找到了她，说他们的勤奋让人明白，他们是最适合帮助她的。她最近了解到，阿夫松仍然被光明卫队关押着，被关在城外几英里的一个被称为 \"审判台 \"的魔法拘留所里。拉莱急切地想让这些人物参与到拯救阿夫松的计划中来。",
	"If the characters agree to help Laleh, she goes on to explain that the Silent Roar has arranged a diversion in the city the following evening. Laleh expects this diversion will lead members of the Brightguard in the city to call upon those at the Pedestal of Judgment for support. This will leave the site where Afsoun is being held only lightly guarded. There's time before the plan is to commence, but when the characters are ready, she leads them to meet with a group of Silent Roar agents—see the \"{@area Pedestal of Judgment|394|x}\" section.": "如果角色们同意帮助拉莱，她会继续解释，沉默的咆哮已经在第二天晚上在城市里安排了一次转移。拉莱希望这次转移会导致城里的光明卫队成员向审判台的人寻求支持。这将使关押阿夫松的地方只有轻微的守卫。离计划开始还有一段时间，但当人物准备好后，她会带领他们去见一群沉默咆哮的特工--见\"{@area Pedestal of Judgment|394|x} \"部分。",

	"If the characters don't reveal the imminent attempt to free Afsoun, the insightful Artavazda shares a concern about the likelihood of such a breakout. The pari asks the characters to go the Pedestal of Judgment and support the Brightguard members there in capturing alive any who attack the prison.

	"The Pedestal of Judgment is a stone disc whose ancient magic keeps it hovering high above the arid landscape approximately 5 miles outside Akharin Sangar. Atash built this site for use as a holding prison to ensure Brightguard headquarters would be seen as a place of justice, not punishment. The Brightguard brings detainees to this platform for questioning and temporary incarceration, suspending them in magical crystals that only Celestials can use the Pedestal to create. Prisoners remain here until they are freed or are sentenced and transferred to Zendaane Sabz, Atash's impenetrable Sky Prison.": "审判之座是一个石盘，其古老的魔力使它高高地盘旋在阿克哈林桑加尔城外约5英里的干旱地区。阿塔什建造这个地方是为了作为拘留所使用，以确保光明卫队总部被视为一个正义的地方，而不是惩罚。光明卫队将被拘留者带到这个平台进行审问和临时监禁，将他们悬挂在只有天人可以使用基座制造的神奇水晶中。囚犯们一直呆在这里，直到他们被释放或被判刑并转移到阿塔什坚不可摧的天空监狱Zendaane Sabz。",

	"Depending on how the characters choose to operate, you might end up combining aspects of both Artavazda and Laleh's missions to the Pedestal of Judgment. Characters working with Laleh Ghorbani might pretend to serve Artavazda, hoping to lull the pari into a false sense of security that makes the rescue of Afsoun Ghorbani easier. Or the characters might pretend to aid Laleh, but then report the Silent Roar agents when they reach the Pedestal of Judgment. Just as the politics of Akharin Sangar aren't cut and dry, so might the characters' plans get complicated. Work with the characters to come up with a plan and be flexible with how the adventure's factions respond. Keep in mind, though, that it's unlikely the characters can please both the Brightguard and the Silent Roar with their deeds.": "根据角色选择的操作方式，你最终可能会将阿尔塔瓦兹达和拉莱赫在审判台的任务的各个方面结合起来。与Laleh Ghorbani合作的角色可能会假装为Artavazda服务，希望能让pari陷入一种虚假的安全感，从而使营救Afsoun Ghorbani更加容易。或者人物可能假装援助拉莱，但当他们到达审判台时，会报告沉默咆哮的特工。正如Akharin Sangar的政治不是一成不变的，角色的计划也可能变得复杂。与角色一起想出一个计划，并灵活处理冒险中各派别的反应。不过，请记住，角色们不可能用他们的行为同时取悦光明卫士和沉默的咆哮。",

The Silent Roar members are loyal to Afsoun and are unlikely to be talked out of abandoning their leader—particularly after enacting a plan to liberate her.": "如果人物为光明卫士保卫审判台，他们会遇到三个沉默咆哮的特工：两个{@creature Veteran||veterans}骑兵{@creature Manticore||manticores}，以及叛军的盟友和阿夫松的朋友马齐耶{@creature gynosphinx}。沉默咆哮的成员对阿夫松很忠诚，不太可能被说服放弃他们的领袖--特别是在制定了解放她的计划之后。",

	"Regardless of the characters' allegiance, their actions and the fallout of Afsoun's detainment or escape have broad implications for Akharin Sangar. The Silent Roar's resistance efforts increase in either case, causing the organization to become the Brightguard's greatest rival. If the characters remain in Akharin Sangar, Artavazda or the Ghorbani sisters seek to enlist them in the factions' conflict. As either the Brightguard continues to crack down on rebels or the Silent Roar encourages wider resistance, the characters are likely to be drawn into increasingly desperate conflicts, eventually coming to the attention of the land's ruler, Atash himself.": "无论人物的忠诚度如何，他们的行为以及阿夫松被拘留或逃跑的后果都对阿卡林-桑格有着广泛的影响。无论哪种情况，沉默的咆哮都会加大抵抗力度，导致该组织成为光明卫士的最大对手。如果人物留在阿卡林-桑加尔，阿尔塔瓦兹达或戈尔巴尼姐妹会设法让他们加入到派别冲突中。随着光明卫队继续镇压反叛者，或者沉默的咆哮鼓励更广泛的抵抗，人物很可能被卷入越来越多的绝望的冲突，最终引起土地统治者阿塔什本人的注意。",
	"From the turquoise spires of this holy city-state's oldest temple, a radiant angel watches over Akharin Sangar. His name is Atash. For many, his presence is a source of comfort: a promise of protection and guidance. But a growing proportion of Sangarians find his rule suffocating. The angel's word is law, his doctrine rigid, and his enforcement absolute.": "在这个神圣的城邦最古老的寺庙的绿松石尖顶上，一位光芒四射的天使在守护着阿卡林-桑格。他的名字叫阿塔什。对许多人来说，他的存在是一个安慰的来源：一个保护和指导的承诺。但越来越多的桑加人发现他的统治令人窒息。天使的话就是法律，他的教义是严格的，他的执行也是绝对的。",
	"Akharin Sangar is a vibrant city-state with a deep appreciation for art and tradition. It rests on a plateau beneath the Heavenly Peaks, a bulwark of rugged, snow-capped mountains that have protected their lands for centuries.

	"Akharin Sangar has all but closed its gates to the rest of the world. Outsiders often surmise the city-state is full of zealots as severe as the city's angel ruler. In truth, Sangarians are a friendly, hospitable people, eager to share their traditions with visitors and unhappy with Atash's embargoes and nightly curfew.

Meanwhile, pernicious anarchists called the Ashen Heirs foment unrest, striving for change at any cost.": "阿克哈林-桑加已经完全关闭了它对世界其他地方的大门。外人常常猜测这个城邦充满了像城市的天使统治者一样严厉的狂热者。事实上，桑加里人是一个友好、好客的民族，渴望与游客分享他们的传统，并对阿塔什的禁运和夜间宵禁感到不满。一个由工匠、哲学家和商人组成的团体已经形成了一个被称为 \"沉默的咆哮 \"的秘密联盟，试图通过建立人民的统治来推翻阿塔什并恢复城市的活力。同时，名为 \"灰烬继承人 \"的邪恶无政府主义者煽动动乱，不惜一切代价争取变革。",

Celestial is also commonly spoken among Atash's followers and theologians.": "主要语言是Zabaani。虽然所有的公民也说普通话，但由于阿克哈林桑加的游客不多，他们很少有机会练习普通话。在阿塔什的追随者和神学家中也普遍使用天语。",

Occasionally, Atash appears on the palace's garden terrace to issue a proclamation, much like the rulers who preceded him.": "光明卫的成员，一个由保护者和执行者组成的神圣组织，把高贵的宝石--曾经的王宫--称为他们的总部。偶尔，阿塔什会出现在宫殿的花园露台上发布公告，就像他之前的那些统治者一样。",

	"The hills beneath the Heavenly Peaks are fertile, blessing farmers with bountiful harvests of juicy pomegranates, buttery pistachios, and crimson strands of saffron. Rebellion also flourishes, as the Brightguard has a smaller presence here, and the nation's curfew is not enforced. Free thinkers gather at aged teahouses, discussing philosophy as they sip from steaming cups, and acting as secret missionaries who dare to defy angelic law.": "天堂之峰下的山丘十分肥沃，为农民提供了丰收的多汁石榴、奶油开心果和深红色的藏红花。叛乱也很猖獗，因为光明卫队在这里的存在较少，而且国家的宵禁也没有强制执行。自由思想家们聚集在古老的茶馆里，一边喝着热气腾腾的茶杯，一边讨论哲学，并作为秘密传教士，敢于藐视天使的法律。",
	"Despite the rumors outside its borders, Akharin Sangar is markedly hospitable. By long-standing custom, every Sangarian is a potential host and must be prepared to entertain guests on short notice. Visitors are invited to relax on luxurious carpets adorned with colorful pillows while their host prepares them hot beverages—if not an entire meal.": "尽管在其边界外有很多传言，但阿卡林-桑加尔明显地好客。根据长期以来的习俗，每个桑加人都是潜在的主人，必须准备在短时间内招待客人。游客被邀请在装饰有彩色枕头的豪华地毯上休息，而他们的主人则为他们准备热饮--如果不是整顿饭。",
	"A thirst for knowledge permeates Akharin Sangar. Its many independent schools are free to teach broad curricula that beget a well-read populace, although the long list of censored works constrains opportunities for higher education, especially in philosophy and literature. The city-state cautiously embraces progress, adopting developments in magic and science as long as they don't contradict religious principles.": "对知识的渴求弥漫在阿克哈林-桑加尔。它的许多独立的学校可以自由地教授广泛的课程，从而培养出一个饱学之士，尽管一长串的审查作品限制了接受高等教育的机会，特别是在哲学和文学方面。这个城邦谨慎地拥抱进步，只要不违背宗教原则，就会采用魔法和科学的发展。",
	"Akharin Sangar has a rich artistic heritage. Architecture is thoughtful and symbolic, and instruments like the barbat and kamancheh sweeten poetic lyrics with their unmistakable tones. Sangarian carpets exemplify the city-state's long history of vibrant textiles: painstakingly woven rugs are highly sought works of art. Some are even rumored to fly.": "阿克哈林-桑加尔有丰富的艺术遗产。建筑是深思熟虑的，具有象征意义的，像巴尔巴特和卡曼切这样的乐器以其明确无误的音调使诗意的歌词变得甜美。桑加里安的地毯体现了这个城邦悠久的充满活力的纺织品的历史：精心编织的地毯是非常受欢迎的艺术品。有些甚至被传为会飞。",
	"Sangarian cuisine emphasizes savory, sweet, and sour flavors. When households entertain guests and during festivals, kabobs and hearty stews infused with saffron grace dinner plates alongside beds of rice. Bakers stay busy, filling bellies with chewy flatbreads and scrumptious pastries tinged with rosewater. But Sangarians know how to stretch small pots of a soup called aash to feed an entire family.": "桑干菜强调咸味、甜味和酸味。当家庭招待客人和节日时，烤肉和浸泡在藏红花中的丰盛的炖菜会与米饭一起摆在餐盘上。面包师们一直在忙碌着，用有嚼劲的扁平面包和带着玫瑰水的美味糕点填饱肚子。但是，桑加人知道如何将一小锅被称为 \"阿什 \"的汤扩展到养活整个家庭。",
	"Clothing is generally modest, and Sangarians value fashionable dress. Men's attire consists of baggy trousers, handwoven shoes, and robes or tunics secured with wide cloth belts.

Common headwear includes scarves, caps, and headbands with veiled hats.": "服装一般都很朴素，桑干人重视时尚的服饰。男子的服装包括宽大的裤子、手织鞋和用宽布带固定的长袍或外衣。女性通常穿得很有层次，穿着优雅的长裙和带有厚重刺绣的上衣。花卉图案是常见的，不分性别，颜色从鲜艳到柔和不等，这取决于人们的喜好。常见的头饰包括围巾、帽子和带有面纱的头巾。",
	"Unprepared visitors might find some aspects of Sangarian society unusually austere. Intoxicants are prohibited within the city, there's a strict curfew after sundown, and everyday interactions are tinged with restraint to steer clear of Atash's forbiddances. Sangarians reserve intimacy for family and close friends, lowering their social guard only in the comfort of their homes.": "没有准备的游客可能会发现桑加里亚社会的某些方面异常简朴。城市内禁止使用有毒物质，日落后有严格的宵禁，日常交往中也有克制，以避开阿塔什的禁止规定。桑加里人将亲密关系留给家人和亲密的朋友，只有在舒适的家中才会降低他们的社会警惕。",
	"Most Sangarians revere the Sunweaver—or pretend to. Locally, the Sunweaver's faith uses an upright torch topped with a blazing sun as its symbol. Activities halt during daily prayers, which take place at dawn, noon, and sundown. Though other faiths are tolerated, those faiths are sequestered in shrines on the city's outskirts. Public preaching is considered taboo, and unauthorized missionary work earns the ire of the Brightguard. The nature of the Sunweaver and whether they're a unique god or a regional name for another deity—like Dol Arrah or Pholtus ({@book detailed|PHB|12} in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB})—is up to you.": "大多数桑加里人敬仰织日者，或者假装敬仰。在当地，织女的信仰使用一个直立的火炬，上面有一个炽热的太阳作为其象征。活动在每天的祈祷中停止，祈祷在黎明、中午和日落时分进行。虽然其他信仰也被容忍，但这些信仰都被封存在城市郊区的神社里。公开布道被视为禁忌，未经授权的传教工作会招致光明卫士的愤怒。太阳神的性质，以及他们是一个独特的神，还是另一个神的地区名称，如多尔-阿拉赫或波尔图斯（{@book detailed|PHB|12}在{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}）--由你决定。",
	"The Sunweaver holds ultimate authority in Akharin Sangar, which is a theocracy ruled by the god's self-proclaimed messenger.

In addition to priestly duties, they act as government officials and judges, employing divination magic in audits and trials.": "织日者在阿克哈林桑加拥有最终的权威，这是一个由神的自称的信使统治的神权。阿塔什解释了织日神的教义，并鼓励所有公民培养光明和温暖。织日神的神职人员拥有重要的权力。除了牧师的职责外，他们还充当政府官员和法官，在审计和审判中运用占卜魔法。",

The religious order enforces the law without prejudice, though its ranks contain both tender-hearted civil servants and disciplinarians who relish chastising citizens for misdemeanors.": "违反法律的人要向光明卫士负责。这个宗教团体毫无偏见地执行法律，尽管它的队伍中既有心地善良的公务员，也有乐于责罚公民不端行为的惩戒者。",

When Piruzan's people were tormented by the horned demon Zolmate Shab, she led them up the Heavenly Peaks in search of a land free from tyranny and darkness. The demon intercepted them at the summit, appearing in a pillar of smoke. Emboldened by the coming dawn, the first Sangarians prepared to make a last stand. With the power of the Sunweaver, Piruzan banished the relentless demon. She became queen of this new land and ruled for over three hundred years, never forgetting the Sunweaver's warmth.": "Akharin Sangar最著名的历史故事是一首关于其英雄创始人Piruzan的史诗。当Piruzan的人民被有角的恶魔Zolmate Shab折磨的时候，她带领他们登上天峰，寻找一个没有暴政和黑暗的土地。恶魔在山顶拦截了他们，出现在一道烟柱中。在即将到来的黎明的鼓舞下，第一批桑格人准备做最后的抵抗。皮鲁赞用太阳神的力量，驱逐了无情的恶魔。她成为这片新土地的女王，统治了三百多年，从未忘记织日者的温暖。",
	"Akharin Sangar flourished during the dynasties that followed but eventually succumbed to excess, corruption, and complacency. Darkness fell upon the city-state, and Zolmate Shab returned.

	"Afterward, Atash prophesied the return of Zolmate Shab, even stronger than before, if the people of Akharin Sangar fell from grace again.

	"Atash possesses an ageless and inflexible perspective. Everlasting and seemingly emotionless, the angel answers complex problems with direct solutions. He believes that only by following his decrees can Sangarians prevent another demonic incursion. He deems those who oppose him outlaws.": "阿塔什拥有一个不老的和不灵活的观点。永恒的，似乎没有感情的，这位天使用直接的解决方案回答复杂的问题。他认为，只有遵循他的法令，桑格利亚人才能防止另一次恶魔入侵。他认为那些反对他的人都是亡命之徒。",

Some believe these mystical practices and defensive martial strategies should be restored to reestablish the power Djaynai held in the past. Others believe they should only be used as the basis for new arts and then retired. Still others want the lost lore destroyed so Djaynai and Janya can break from the past that binds them.

	"A figure with kelp-colored hair and stingray-colored skin approaches the characters, introducing himself as Xoese-Addae, an emissary of the High Court of Janya.

	"Modern Djaynai is a coastal realm descended from a grand civilization. Though the nation has never been defeated by external forces, its fortunes were greatly diminished hundreds of years ago after raiders perpetrated atrocities upon the land and its people in a series of attacks known as the Passage of Vultures. Djaynai's defenders drove the raiders off, albeit at a high cost. Even in its diminished state, the nation serves as an exemplar of self-sovereignty and dignity, defended by scouts known as the Lightsea Lancers, who watch for bandit groups and marauders aiming to raid Djaynai and its neighbors.": "现代贾伊奈是一个沿海王国，是一个伟大文明的后代。虽然这个国家从来没有被外部力量打败过，但在几百年前，在一系列被称为 \"秃鹰之路 \"的袭击中，突袭者对这片土地和人民犯下了暴行，它的财富因此而大打折扣。贾伊奈的守卫者赶走了袭击者，尽管付出了高昂的代价。即使在其衰弱的状态下，这个国家仍然是自我主权和尊严的典范，由被称为Lightsea Lancers的侦察兵保卫，他们监视着旨在袭击贾伊奈及其邻国的强盗团伙和掠夺者。",
	"Modern Janya is a majestic, deep-sea city protected by magical wards that resemble an opalescent aurora with the sheen of a blue-black pearl. Its buildings are castle-like structures resembling those of Djaynai above, but made from magically hardened, obsidian-hued silt and studded by crystalline support beams jutting from the smooth walls.": "现代的詹亚是一座雄伟的深海城市，受到魔法防护罩的保护，像一道乳白色的极光，有着蓝黑色珍珠的光泽。它的建筑是城堡式的结构，类似于上面的贾伊奈，但由魔法硬化的黑曜石色的淤泥制成，并在光滑的墙壁上突起了结晶状的支撑梁。",

	"Djaynai is a peaceful land dominated by mangrove forests along the southern coast and jagged cliffs to the north. Its calm coastal waters are known as the Lightsea, but beyond a continental shelf the waters grow suddenly deeper.

	"Home to the spiritual faction known as the Night Revelers, the Ancestors' Danse House in Djaynai is a mausoleum with smooth, chalky-white, mud-brick walls.

	"This great undersea trench near Janya resonates with mystery and foreboding. It is named in memory of the countless Djaynaians who vanished into its depths during the earliest days of the Passage of Vultures, before the first {@creature Nightsea chil-liren|JttRC} came to be. The trench is defined by the pale-pink meadows of feathery creatures known as sea lilies that grow along its edges. Scouts of Janya's Billowing Patrol have explored only a small fraction of the trench, which contains the wrecks of numerous ships and mysterious sites.": "詹亚附近的这条巨大的海底海沟充满了神秘和不祥的预感。它的名字是为了纪念在 \"秃鹰之路 \"最早的日子里，在第一个{@creature Nightsea chil-liren|JttRC}出现之前消失在其深处的无数贾伊奈人。海沟的定义是沿其边缘生长的被称为海百合的淡粉色羽毛状生物的草地。扬雅的 \"飞鸟巡逻队 \"的侦察员只探索了海沟的一小部分，里面有许多船只的残骸和神秘的遗址。",
	"A center of culture in Janya, the Cerulean Lyceum is a great bardic college with a connected series of vaulted halls set around a broad quadrangle.

	"Both realms' culture is tightly tied to Djaynai's historical roots as an advanced, influential civilization. Education and creativity are the foundations of the culture, and its people embrace philosophy, magic, mathematics, and the study of underwater societies.

As such, most people are open to the spiritual views of others, as long as those views don't embrace evil.": "两个王国的文化都与贾伊奈的历史根源紧密相连，是一个先进的、有影响力的文明。教育和创造力是文化的基础，它的人民拥护哲学、魔法、数学和对水下社会的研究。为了与这些传统保持一致，精神信仰并不注重神灵，而是崇尚和模仿解放、流动和变化等力量。因此，大多数人对其他人的精神观点持开放态度，只要这些观点不拥护邪恶。",
	"Meals are considered sacred in Djaynai, and wasting food is a major breach of etiquette. Key ingredients of Djaynai's cuisine include banana, groundnut, milk from several types of animals, red and black beans, and chili peppers. In Janya, edible undersea plants form the bulk of people's diet, supplemented by ingredients imported from Djaynai. As a rule, both peoples eschew eating meat.": "在贾伊奈，吃饭被认为是神圣的，浪费食物是严重违反礼节的行为。贾伊奈美食的主要成分包括香蕉、花生、几种动物的牛奶、红豆和黑豆，以及辣椒。在詹亚，可食用的海底植物构成了人们饮食的主要部分，并辅以从贾伊奈进口的食材。通常情况下，这两个民族都避免吃肉。",
	"Djaynaian clothing combines rough-spun and delicate materials, and it is common to see linen with lace or damask with crocheted fabrics in the same outfit. Most Djaynaians wear a form of shawl or cloak at all times, and their fashion favors muted colors. Headwear is typically worn in public, most commonly cowls with pointed caps, wide-brimmed hats, or tagelmusts and tasuwarts that can function as headgear and veil. Clothing in Janya parallels Djaynaian style but features materials like eel skin and elegantly woven sea grasses.": "贾伊纳人的服装结合了粗纺和精致的材料，在同一件衣服中，经常可以看到亚麻布与花边或大马士革与钩编织物。大多数贾伊奈人在任何时候都会穿上一种披肩或斗篷，他们的时尚倾向于柔和的颜色。头饰通常在公共场合佩戴，最常见的是带尖帽的罩子，宽边帽，或者可以作为头饰和面纱的tagelmusts和tasuwarts。詹亚的服装与贾伊奈的风格相似，但以鳗鱼皮和优雅的海草编织品等材料为特色。",
	"The government of Djaynai is called the People's Stewards, whose leadership ranks change whenever a significant number of citizens publicly call for new elections. All citizens of Djaynai are simultaneously seen as nobles, workers, and potential Stewards. The anarchic spiritual group called the Night Revelers poses a challenge to the Stewards' authority, arguing that Djaynai must abandon all government to truly be free.": "贾伊奈的政府被称为 \"人民管家\"，每当有大量的公民公开要求进行新的选举时，其领导层就会发生变化。贾伊奈的所有公民都同时被视为贵族、工人和潜在的管理人。无政府主义的精神团体 \"夜间启示者 \"对管理人的权威提出了挑战，认为贾伊奈必须放弃所有政府才能真正获得自由。",
	"The security forces that protect Djaynai—including the scouts known as Lightsea Lancers—are highly effective in their roles, but Djaynaian law emphasizes redemption over punishment. In the direst criminal cases, controversial rituals are performed to prevent the offender from acting on their wicked impulses. The offender is then banished for life.": "保护Djaynai的安全部队--包括被称为Lightsea Lancers的侦察兵--在他们的角色中非常有效，但Djaynai的法律强调救赎而不是惩罚。在最严重的犯罪案件中，会举行有争议的仪式，以防止罪犯的邪恶冲动。然后，犯罪者将被终身放逐。",
	"Janya is an oligarchy ruled by a group called the High Court, some members of which are able to contact key leaders in Djaynai on rare occasions through magical means. Members of the High Court—and the many agents and liaisons who serve it—work in the city's magnificent Council Chamber, which is housed within the shell of a gigantic whelk. However, friction between the Djaynaist and New Janyan factions of the High Court can turn meetings into fraught debates.": "詹亚是一个由称为高级法院的团体统治的寡头政权，其中一些成员能够在罕见的情况下通过魔法手段与贾伊奈的主要领导人联系。高级法院的成员--以及为其服务的许多代理人和联络人--在城市宏伟的议事厅工作，该议事厅被安置在一个巨大的海螺壳内。然而，高级法院的贾伊纳派和新詹尼派之间的摩擦会使会议变成充满争议的辩论。",

	"Djaynai has been a beacon of independence and knowledge for millennia. Indeed, Djaynai has ultimately prevailed over all invaders, with a key role played by the mystical practices known as the Blackmist Way and Blackthrone Arts. Unfortunately, Djaynai's friendly neighboring realms are more often threatened. For instance, inscrutable lizardfolk in the wetlands periodically congregate and cause havoc in the nearby ocean. The Lightsea Lancers—who take their name from the shallow coastal waters Djaynaians call the Lightsea—was formed to monitor such threats before they impact Djaynai. Travelers occasionally come to Djaynai to learn the Lightsea Lancers' ways, as their heroics, dance-like martial arts, and knowledge of transmutation magic are renowned throughout Djaynai and beyond.": "几千年来，贾伊奈一直是独立和知识的灯塔。事实上，贾伊奈最终战胜了所有的入侵者，其中一个关键的作用是被称为黑雾之路和黑石之术的神秘实践。不幸的是，Djaynai的友好邻邦更经常受到威胁。例如，湿地中高深莫测的蜥蜴人定期聚集在一起，在附近的海洋中造成破坏。光之海长矛队--他们的名字来自于贾伊奈人称之为光之海的浅海水域--是为了在这些威胁影响到贾伊奈之前监测它们。旅行者们偶尔会来贾伊奈学习Lightsea Lancers的方法，因为他们的英雄气概、舞蹈般的武术以及转化魔法的知识在贾伊奈和其他地方都很有名。",
	"Beneath the Nightsea, the realm of Janya has its own tales. Many tell of how early Janyans were focused not only on rebuilding their lives but on preserving what they treasured from the land above. To keep such lore safe, ancestral Janyans built structures in hidden reaches, like the Trench of Love Lost, to archive sacred wisdom before it was lost. Eventually, though, such archives faded from memory. Profound Djaynaian secrets remain hidden in the deep, awaiting rekindling.": "在夜海之下，詹亚王国有它自己的故事。许多人讲述了早期的詹尼亚人如何不仅专注于重建他们的生活，而且专注于保护他们从上面的土地上珍惜的东西。为了保护这些传说的安全，祖先们在隐蔽的地方建造了一些建筑，如失恋之沟，在神圣的智慧消失之前将其存档。但最终，这种档案还是从记忆中消失了。深奥的贾伊奈人的秘密仍然隐藏在深处，等待着重新点燃。",

On a failed check, the character investigates a few statues and doesn't see anything remarkable.

Most days, wealthy petitioners are turned away and must seek other means to solve their problems.": "每天早上，升天之门被打开，寻求皇帝垂青的请愿者挤到被称为神智殿的宫殿前的广场上。大臣们与每个请愿者面谈--并迅速拒绝太过琐碎的请求，以保证皇帝的参与。广场也是扒手和间谍的主要地点。大多数时候，富有的请愿者被拒之门外，必须寻求其他途径来解决他们的问题。",

	"Over the centuries, the rulers of Yongjing have expanded and updated the city, building on top of existing architecture.

	"The importance of a long life is drilled into children from an early age.

	"In the imperial court, tradition dictates that the social standing of each member of the emperor's family is determined by the preferences of the emperor.

	"At no time is an emperor's favor in greater question than when they die. Rarely do Yongjing's long-lived rulers have to consider the prospect of death, and they put even less consideration into designating a particular heir from among their shorter-lived family members. When an emperor dies unexpectedly, a period of squabbling follows, as imperial family members, secret offspring, and pretenders produce evidence of being the past emperor's favorite. These squabbles ultimately devolve into secret wars, as the Inner Butterfly Court becomes beset by intrigue, assassinations, and disappearances until a single heir claims and holds the throne for a year's time. Only then is that individual universally accepted as the new emperor.": "在任何时候，帝王的宠爱都不会比他们死亡时更有问题。雍京的长寿统治者很少需要考虑死亡的前景，而他们更少考虑从寿命较短的家庭成员中指定一个特定的继承人。当一个皇帝意外去世时，随之而来的是一段时间的争吵，因为皇室成员、秘密后代和冒名顶替者都会拿出证据证明自己是前任皇帝的最爱。这些争吵最终演变为秘密战争，因为内蝶宫被阴谋、暗杀和失踪所困扰，直到有一个继承人声称并保持一年的王位。只有在那时，这个人被普遍接受为新皇帝。",
	"A typical meal in Yongjing might include sweet or savory buns, salty pork, and stir-fried dandelion leaves.

	"Clothing in Yongjing favors loose and flowing styles—and the wealthier the wearer, the more elaborate the embroidery. Ministers are identifiable by their black winged caps, while members of the royal family wear elaborate headdresses.": "雍京的服装偏向于宽松飘逸的风格--穿戴者越是富有，刺绣就越精致。大臣们戴着黑色的翼帽，而皇室成员则戴着精致的头饰。",
	"The households of city residents are built around the clan, made up of several generations of family members and multiple spouses of any gender, typically joined through arranged marriages. A clear hierarchy within each of these complex familial structures helps to facilitate social harmony. Members of a clan keep close eyes on one another, because the deeds of an individual affect the social standing of the clan as a whole.": "城市居民的家庭是围绕着宗族建立的，由几代家庭成员和多对男女配偶组成，通常通过包办婚姻加入。在这些复杂的家庭结构中，每个家庭都有明确的等级制度，有助于促进社会和谐。氏族成员相互之间保持密切关注，因为个人的行为会影响整个氏族的社会地位。",

The area in which the city of Yongjing would one day rise was originally populated by nomadic dwarf shepherds. As humans immigrated to the region, conflict between the races broke out. Legends say that the violence persisted for a century, until the Dragon of Heavenly Blessings who had founded Great Xing returned.

That realm's serpentine protector, the spirit Chimagua, was fond of mortals and would bestow visions upon the folk of Atagua. However, when Atagua fell to invaders from a distant land, visions from Chimagua ended. The sages known as the Green Doctors sought to reconnect the land to the Feywild, but their attempts failed and weakened the planar fabric around Atagua.

Any time Yarana takes damage, she can make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw to escape the aboleths' control. If freed, Yarana points to the water and warns that the true threat is there, prompting the {@creature aboleth} Glol to emerge and attack if the characters haven't already encountered that aboleth.

She doesn't know how to combat it, but she suggests the characters takes the {@item White Ghost Orchid Seed|JttRC|white seed} pod from the Ghost Orchid in {@area area C5|4de|x}.

	"A sphere the size of a human head and composed of oversized centipede limbs encompasses a foul light. This sphere is a fraction of the Drought Elder's alien consciousness. It uses the {@creature demilich} stat block but is an Aberration rather than Undead. It ignores the characters unless they try to harm it or try to enter area {@dice D5}—either through this area or via another route.

	"Much of Atagua consists of grasslands, wetlands, and narrow stretches of tropical forests bordering the Holroro River. Two extreme seasons each year of intense rain and dusty drought have shaped this land and blessed its people with resilience.

	"For nearly two hundred years, the people of Atagua have thrived, peacefully trading among diverse outposts connected by the Grassroads—a system of walkways elevated to protect from floods, fires, and other threats and engineered by the ancient Flood People who first settled these lands. Yet danger remains.

Spread across the basin of the twisting Holroro River, the peoples of this land dwell in scattered outposts connected by walkways called the Grassroads.": "阿塔瓜是一个由热带草原平原和长廊森林组成的崎岖国家--一个被当地人称为拉诺斯的大草原。这片土地上的人们分布在曲折的霍尔罗罗河流域，他们居住在分散的前哨，由被称为 \"草路 \"的步行道连接。",
	"The Grassroads are a system of elevated, 15-foot-wide roads ranging from 5 to 20 feet in height and punctuated by lean-to shelters; the roads and shelters alike are constructed from wood, reeds, and stone. The folk of Atagua use these roads to ensure safe passage above the many hazards of the Llanos. Traders and farmers walk the roads day and night, protected by the elite fighter-scouts known as Cababa warriors, who patrol constantly for poachers and bandits. Thri-kreen can often be found scavenging the ground beneath the pathways for items dropped from above. They then trade these items for panela—cones of brown sugar cooked in mills across Atagua.": "草路是一个由高架、15英尺宽的道路组成的系统，高度从5英尺到20英尺不等，并以简易棚为点缀；道路和棚子都是由木材、芦苇和石头建成的。阿塔瓜的居民使用这些道路，以确保在拉诺斯的许多危险中安全通行。商人和农民日夜行走在这些道路上，受到被称为卡巴战士的精锐战士的保护，他们不断地巡逻，寻找偷猎者和强盗。经常可以发现特里-格林在道路下面的地面上捡拾从上面掉下来的物品。然后，他们用这些物品换取阿塔瓜各地磨坊里烹制的红糖的panera-cones。",
	"Hundreds of farming villages dot the Llanos, bordered by sugarcane fields and orchards of cacao trees. El Caparazón (\"The Shell\") is the largest of these settlements and the capital of Atagua. It was named for a latticework partial dome built by the Flood People hundreds of years ago. The dome provides precious shade to the central square known as the Mercado Sucre and to a grand hacienda roofed with amber-hued tiles. Called the Sugar Alcázar, this hacienda is home to Alfonz Rubinaz-Zumdi, the powerful landowner known as the Sugar Man.": "数以百计的农业村落点缀在拉诺斯地区，与甘蔗田和可可树果园为邻。El Caparazón（\"贝壳\"）是这些定居点中最大的一个，也是阿塔瓜的首都。它因数百年前洪荒人建造的一个格子状的部分圆顶而得名。穹顶为被称为苏克雷市场的中央广场和一个用琥珀色瓦片盖顶的大庄园提供了珍贵的遮阳。这座庄园被称为 \"糖城\"（Sugar Alcázar），是被称为 \"糖人 \"的强大地主阿方索-鲁比纳斯-祖姆迪（Alfonz Rubinaz-Zumdi）的家。",
	"About 5 miles outside the city, Port Panela serves as Atagua's port. It boasts dozens of wooden docks as well as thatched huts on stilted platforms, and the harbor teems with sleek trade boats returning or departing with sugar, cacao, goods, and travelers.": "在城外约5英里处，帕拉纳港是阿塔瓜的港口。它拥有几十个木制码头以及高台上的茅草屋，港口里充斥着带着糖、可可、货物和旅行者返回或离开的光滑贸易船。",
	"Three remote settlements, collectively known as \"the outposts,\" are home to the most notable factions of Atagua. One is a busy encampment that serves as a base for the Tribe of Builders, the engineers and workers who repair and extend the Grassroads. Every six years they rebuild this encampment, which they affectionately call the Devil's Hammock. The second outpost was once the El Chapán rum distillery; after it closed down long ago, it became a trading post for the thri-kreen of the Llanos. The third outpost is the Silver Tapir Monastery, which serves as the sanctuary and school of the Green Doctors.": "三个偏远的定居点，统称为 \"前哨\"，是阿塔瓜最著名的派别的所在地。一个是繁忙的营地，作为建设者部落的基地，这些工程师和工人负责修理和扩展草路。每隔六年，他们就会重建这个营地，他们亲切地称之为 \"恶魔之丘\"。第二个前哨曾经是埃尔查潘朗姆酒厂；在它很久以前关闭后，它成为拉诺斯的特里-格林的贸易站。第三个前哨是银貘修道院，它是绿医生的避难所和学校。",
	"Those who live in Atagua or travel through the Llanos are shaped by the following truths.": "那些生活在阿塔瓜的人或在拉诺斯旅行的人都被以下真理所塑造。",
	"Nearly five hundred years ago, an invading force rolled across the Llanos of Atagua, thereafter invading the neighboring region of San Citlán. But after three centuries of occupation, the mixed descendants of the Flood People who first settled Atagua and former invaders who made peace with them decisively expelled their would-be rulers after a thirteen-year war of independence. Atagua's people are the result of the multigenerational intermingling between the native Flood People, the descendants of invaders who rebelled against their leaders and settled here, and a steady stream of new immigrants and adventurers drawn to the freedom and challenges of life on the Llanos.": "近五百年前，一支入侵部队辗转于阿塔瓜的拉诺斯，此后又入侵了邻近的圣西特兰地区。但经过三个世纪的占领后，最初在阿塔瓜定居的洪荒人和与他们讲和的前侵略者的混合后裔，经过13年的独立战争，果断地驱逐了他们的潜在统治者。阿塔瓜的人民是本土洪荒人、反抗其领袖并在此定居的入侵者的后代以及被自由和挑战的拉诺斯生活所吸引的新移民和冒险家之间多代交融的结果。",
	"The aftermath of war was marked by a vibrant rebuilding period. Large settlements such as El Caparazón retained some of the cultural aspects of the long colonial occupation, while rural villages primarily drew on the legacy of the Flood People.": "战争结束后，出现了一个充满活力的重建期。像卡帕拉松（El Caparazón）这样的大型定居点保留了长期殖民占领的一些文化内容，而农村则主要借鉴了洪水人的遗产。",
	"Even after two centuries of peace, tensions sometimes arise between clans and factions due to feuds and the revival of ancient grudges. These conflicts flare but are resolved through hard work, patient negotiations, and compromises by all sides. Overall, the people of Atagua embrace the idea that they form a complicated, diverse culture—and that together, they will shape a hopeful future.": "即使在两个世纪的和平之后，由于仇杀和古老怨恨的复苏，部族和派别之间有时会出现紧张局势。这些冲突会爆发，但通过努力工作、耐心谈判和各方的妥协得到解决。总的来说，阿塔瓜人民接受了这样的想法：他们形成了一种复杂、多样的文化--他们将共同塑造一个充满希望的未来。",
	"Sugar and chocolate are abundant in the cuisine of Atagua, especially in the favored beverages: drinking chocolate, strong coffee, and even stronger rum sweetened with panela—the cooked-down juice of sugarcane. Corn, black beans, and plantains are the cornerstones of every meal, and arepas—grilled buns made from ground corn—are eaten by the wealthy and the poor alike.": "糖和巧克力在阿塔瓜的美食中非常丰富，特别是在受欢迎的饮料中：饮用巧克力、浓咖啡和更浓的朗姆酒，朗姆酒的甜味是用甘蔗的熟汁制成的。玉米、黑豆和大蕉是每顿饭的基石，而且富人和穷人都吃玉米饼--用玉米磨成的烤馒头。",
	"The folk of this land work hard by day, but they mark each noon as the start of the siesta, which offers a much-needed respite from the midday heat. People retire to the shade of haciendas or huts, to rest or quietly gather with their closest kin, for it is said that only the untrustworthy conduct their affairs under the blistering midday sun. And when work is done, evenings explode with social activity and music.": "这片土地上的人们白天辛勤工作，但他们把每个中午作为午睡的开始，这为他们提供了一个急需的休息时间，以抵御中午的炎热。人们退到庄园或小屋的阴凉处休息，或与他们最亲近的人安静地聚在一起，因为据说只有不可靠的人才会在正午的烈日下处理他们的事务。而当工作完成后，晚上就会爆发出社会活动和音乐。",
	"Cropped cotton trousers, long-sleeve tunics, long and loose sleeveless jackets known as gilets, full skirts, and straw hats are everyday dress for people of all genders in Atagua. Geometric tattoos or angular designs painted with butterfly-based pigments are commonplace on faces and hands. And the Cababa warriors and the workers of the Tribe of Builders bear accessories made from feathers and flowers, paired with snakeskin kilts.": "棉质长裤、长袖外衣、被称为长衫的宽松无袖夹克、全裙和草帽是阿塔瓜所有性别的人的日常服饰。脸上和手上的几何纹身或用蝴蝶类颜料绘制的角形图案很常见。卡巴巴战士和建设者部落的工人带着用羽毛和鲜花制成的饰物，与蛇皮 kilts搭配。",
	"Religion in Atagua revolves around the Suwa, a shifting pantheon of hundreds of folk heroes. Small, colorful statues of Suwa heroes are found everywhere in Atagua and are honored with offerings of rum or sweets. Ataguans are tolerant of different beliefs and often adopt legendary figures from other cultures into the Suwa.": "阿塔瓜的宗教围绕着苏瓦，这是一个由数百名民间英雄组成的不断变化的万神殿。在阿塔瓜，随处可见苏瓦英雄的小型彩色雕像，人们用朗姆酒或糖果作为祭品来纪念。阿塔瓜人对不同的信仰持宽容态度，并经常将其他文化中的传奇人物纳入苏瓦族。",
	"The collective of mystics known as the Green Doctors weaves together knowledge of magic and herbal medicine to heal the people and creatures of Atagua. The leader of their order is an elf named Melecio. Green Doctors are recognized by the green sash they wear around their waists, but any healer, mage, or storyteller can study medicine at the order's home, the Silver Tapir Monastery.": "被称为 \"绿色医生 \"的神秘主义者集体将魔法和草药知识编织在一起，为阿塔瓜的人们和生物提供治疗。他们的领袖是一位名叫梅利西奥的精灵。绿医生通过他们腰间的绿色腰带来识别，但任何治疗师、法师或说书人都可以在该组织的总部--银貘修道院学习医学。",
	"Some Ataguan names honor the ancestral heroes of the Flood People, while others are derived by mixing those names with ones from the colonial past. In addition to given names, insightful nicknames from a person's childhood often linger into adulthood. The following are examples of such names:": "一些阿塔贡人的名字是为了纪念洪灾人的祖先英雄，而另一些则是将这些名字与过去殖民时期的名字混合在一起而产生的。除了名字之外，一个人在童年时的有见地的绰号往往会延续到成年后。以下是这类名字的例子。",
	"Estwaldo, Jecson, Oru, Payaro": "埃斯特瓦尔多、杰克森、奥鲁、帕亚罗",
	"Arrow, Little Toucan, Orchid, Quipper": "箭、小鸟、兰花、奎伯",
	"Periro, Secuentes, Táreru, Zárates": "佩里罗，塞昆特斯，塔雷鲁，扎拉特斯",
	"Ataguans dream vividly of a great tepui—a tabletop mountain surrounded by jungle. Though the site is unseen and unreachable, many claim the shared experience of having explored the mesa in their dreams, seeing others like themselves in passing, and meeting otherworldly beings.": "阿塔古人生动地梦见了一座伟大的特佩伊--一座被丛林包围的桌面山。虽然这个地方看不见，也够不着，但许多人声称他们有共同的经历，即在梦中探索过这个山丘，顺便看到和自己一样的人，并遇到其他世界的人。",
	"The secret behind these dreams is found in the oldest legends, which speak of the Ghost Orchid Tepui existing simultaneously in the Llanos and in the Feywild, parallel to Atagua. The source of the dreams is a powerful crystal called the Sleeping Stone, which many who dream have seen, alongside magical white orchids growing in the crystalline caverns below the tepui's summit.": "这些梦境背后的秘密可以在最古老的传说中找到，传说中的幽灵兰花特佩伊同时存在于拉诺斯（Llanos）和与阿塔瓜（Atagua）平行的精灵世界（Feywild）。梦境的来源是一种被称为 \"沉睡之石 \"的强大水晶，许多做梦的人都看到了它，还有神奇的白兰花生长在特佩伊山顶下的水晶洞里。",
	"As counterpoint to these bright dreams, sinister creatures haunt the history of Atagua. During the war of independence, rattling whistles rose from the Llanos at night. As the fighting increased, the whistling manifested near villages and haciendas, inspiring nightmares or incurable despair for those who survived hearing it. Some reported seeing hunched giants from the corner of the eye—a new threat to terrorize a war-weary people.": "与这些光明的梦想相对应的是，阿塔瓜的历史中出现了邪恶的生物。在独立战争期间，夜间从拉诺斯山脉传来嘎嘎作响的口哨声。随着战斗的加剧，哨声在村庄和庄园附近出现，给那些听到哨声幸存下来的人带来了噩梦或无法治愈的绝望。一些人报告说，他们从眼角看到了驼背的巨人--这是恐吓厌战人民的一个新威胁。",
	"When the fighting ended and Atagua was free once more, the nightmares ended. The menacing whistlers were largely forgotten as the peoples of Atagua embraced peace and reconstruction. But even today, whistlers occasionally appear in the Llanos, evidence that the Far Realm still influences the land. And some among the Green Doctors whisper that Atagua might yet face an invasion by those terrors.": "当战斗结束，阿塔瓜再次获得自由时，恶梦也随之结束。随着阿塔瓜的人民拥抱和平和重建，来势汹汹的吹口哨者基本上被遗忘了。但即使在今天，吹口哨的人偶尔也会出现在拉诺斯，证明远方世界仍然影响着这片土地。绿医生中的一些人低声说，阿塔瓜可能还会面临那些恐怖的入侵。",

	"Whistlers are inscrutable stalkers hailing from airy, screeching reaches of the Far Realm. They are difficult to see as they're not tethered to one point in space, blurring in a state of perpetual physical uncertainty. A dead whistler appears as a gray, featureless, humanlike biped with long limbs and thin fingers. Those stalked by a whistler can't shut out its soundless, seven-note tune, an otherworldly melody that invades and scourges the mind. Few creatures that encounter a whistler escape; those that do are forever haunted by the stalker's frightful tune.": "呼啸者是难以捉摸的潜行者，他们来自远界的空中，尖锐的边缘。它们很难被看到，因为它们没有被拴在空间的某一点上，在一种永久的物理不确定状态下模糊不清。死去的哨兵看起来是一个灰色的、没有特征的、类似人类的双足动物，有着长长的四肢和细长的手指。那些被哨兵盯上的人无法将其无声的七音调拒之门外，那是一种侵入和祸害心灵的异世界的旋律。遇到哨兵的生物很少能逃脱；那些逃脱的生物则永远被跟踪者可怕的曲调所困扰。",
	"When the Radiant Citadel was rediscovered, the Dawn Incarnates lay dormant in the Preserve of the Ancestors. Thirteen were reawakened, but no one could revive the Pearl Carp, Sard Elephant, or the Dawn Avatars associated with the Radiant Citadel's other missing founding civilizations. Recently, agents of the Court of Whispers rediscovered paths to the lands known as the Tayyib Empire and Umizu. When peoples from those realms arrived at the Radiant Citadel, the Pearl Carp and the Sard Elephant awakened, and representatives have since joined the Speakers for the Ancestors. This gives the people of the Radiant Citadel hope that other lost civilizations might also be found.": "当辐射城堡被重新发现的时候，黎明化身就沉睡在祖先的保护区里。十三个人被唤醒了，但没有人能够唤醒珍珠鲤鱼、萨德大象，或与辐射城堡其他失踪的创始文明有关的黎明神通。最近，私语法庭的代理人重新发现了通往塔伊布帝国和倭国的道路。当这些国家的人民来到辐射城堡时，珍珠鲤鱼和萨德大象觉醒了，他们的代表从此加入了祖先的扬声器。这给辐射城堡的人们带来了希望，其他失落的文明也可能被发现。",

Or the characters might pretend to aid Laleh, but then report the Silent Roar agents when they reach the Pedestal of Judgment. Just as the politics of Akharin Sangar aren't cut and dry, so might the characters' plans get complicated. Work with the characters to come up with a plan and be flexible with how the adventure's factions respond. Keep in mind, though, that it's unlikely the characters can please both the Brightguard and the Silent Roar with their deeds.": "根据角色选择的操作方式，你最终可能会把阿尔塔瓦兹达和拉莱在审判台的任务的各个方面结合起来。与{@creature Laleh Ghorbani|JttRC}合作的角色可能会假装为Artavazda服务，希望让帕里陷入一种虚假的安全感，从而使{@creature Afsoun Ghorbani|JttRC}的营救更容易。或者这些人物可能假装援助拉莱，但当他们到达审判台时，会报告沉默咆哮的特工。正如Akharin Sangar的政治不是一成不变的，角色的计划也可能变得复杂。与角色一起想出一个计划，并灵活处理冒险中各派别的反应。不过，请记住，角色们不可能用他们的行为同时取悦光明卫士和沉默的咆哮。",
	"If the characters are working for the Brightguard, Artavazda waits for them in a garden terrace atop the Noble Jewel. The pari is eager to hear how the characters' mission went and thanks them profusely for keeping Akharin Sangar safe. Artavazda promises that any foes the characters killed will be returned to life so they can face justice. The pari gives each character a sapphire worth 500 gp before producing a cloak made of flawless white feathers with a single golden feather that would sit high on the wearer's back. The cloak has the properties of {@item wings of flying}, and Artavazda explains that the golden feather is from the wing of {@creature Atash|JttRC} himself. Any Brightguard member will recognize the cloak's wearer as a friend of the Sunweaver and Akharin Sangar.": "如果人物是为光明卫队工作，阿尔塔瓦兹达会在贵族宝石顶上的花园露台上等着他们。帕里很想知道人物的任务进展如何，并对他们保护阿克哈林-桑加的安全深表感谢。阿尔塔瓦兹达承诺，任何被人物杀死的敌人都会被复活，这样他们就可以面对正义。帕里给了每个角色一颗价值500gp的蓝宝石，然后制作了一件由无暇的白色羽毛制成的斗篷，其中有一根金色的羽毛，会高高地挂在穿戴者的背上。斗篷具有{@item wings of flying}的属性，Artavazda解释说，金色的羽毛来自{@creature Atash|JttRC}本人的翅膀。任何光明卫士成员都会认出穿斗篷的人是织日者和阿克哈林-桑格的朋友。",
	"Regardless of the characters' allegiance, their actions and the fallout of Afsoun's detainment or escape have broad implications for Akharin Sangar. The Silent Roar's resistance efforts increase in either case, causing the organization to become the Brightguard's greatest rival. If the characters remain in Akharin Sangar, Artavazda or the Ghorbani sisters seek to enlist them in the factions' conflict. As either the Brightguard continues to crack down on rebels or the Silent Roar encourages wider resistance, the characters are likely to be drawn into increasingly desperate conflicts, eventually coming to the attention of the land's ruler, {@creature Atash|JttRC} himself.": "无论人物的忠诚度如何，他们的行为以及阿夫松被拘留或逃跑的后果都对阿卡林-桑加尔产生了广泛的影响。无论哪种情况，沉默的咆哮都会增加抵抗力度，导致该组织成为光明卫士的最大对手。如果人物留在阿卡林-桑加尔，阿尔塔瓦兹达或戈尔巴尼姐妹就会设法让他们加入到派别的冲突中。随着光明卫队继续镇压叛军，或者沉默的咆哮鼓励更广泛的抵抗，人物很可能被卷入越来越多的绝望的冲突中，最终引起土地统治者的注意，{@creature Atash|JttRC}自己。",
	"Akharin Sangar has all but closed its gates to the rest of the world. Outsiders often surmise the city-state is full of zealots as severe as the city's angel ruler. In truth, Sangarians are a friendly, hospitable people, eager to share their traditions with visitors and unhappy with {@creature Atash|JttRC}'s embargoes and nightly curfew. A fellowship of artisans, philosophers, and merchants has formed a secret coalition known as the Silent Roar that seeks to oust {@creature Atash|JttRC} and revive the city by instituting rule by the people. Meanwhile, pernicious anarchists called the Ashen Heirs foment unrest, striving for change at any cost.": "阿克哈林-桑加已经完全关闭了它对世界其他地方的大门。外人常常猜测这个城邦充满了像城市的天使统治者一样严厉的狂热者。事实上，桑加里人是一个友好、好客的民族，渴望与游客分享他们的传统，并对{@creature Atash|JttRC}的禁运和夜间宵禁感到不满。一个由工匠、哲学家和商人组成的团体已经形成了一个秘密联盟，被称为 \"无声的咆哮\"，试图通过建立人民的统治来推翻{@creature Atash|JttRC}并复兴这个城市。同时，名为 \"灰烬继承人 \"的邪恶无政府主义者煽动动乱，不惜一切代价争取变革。",

Given {@creature Atash|JttRC}'s intolerance for misconduct, the prison's population continues to grow, but now it fills with more ordinary folk guilty of lesser crimes.": "在Akharin Sangar东部雄伟的沙漠深处，Zendaane Sabz的浮动建筑，通常被称为天空监狱，悬挂在一个破碎的玻璃湖上。这座监狱是一个晶莹剔透的蜂巢，上面布满了神圣审判的半平面。里面潜伏着被{@creature Atash|JttRC}放逐的强大邪恶，例如{@creature adult blue dracolich}的腐烂者法萨迪(Faasadi the Rotten)，以及不老的切斯玛尔{@creature beholder}，她只能在中和她力量的镜面牢房中欣赏自己的倒影。鉴于{@creature Atash|JttRC}对不当行为的不容忍，监狱里的人口继续增长，但现在监狱里充斥着更多犯有较轻罪行的普通人。",
	"Unprepared visitors might find some aspects of Sangarian society unusually austere. Intoxicants are prohibited within the city, there's a strict curfew after sundown, and everyday interactions are tinged with restraint to steer clear of {@creature Atash|JttRC}'s forbiddances. Sangarians reserve intimacy for family and close friends, lowering their social guard only in the comfort of their homes.": "没有准备的游客可能会发现桑加里亚社会的某些方面异常严苛。城市里禁止使用有毒物质，日落后有严格的宵禁，日常的交往都带着克制的色彩，以避免{@creature Atash|JttRC}的禁令。桑加人将亲密关系保留给家人和亲密的朋友，只有在舒适的家中才会降低他们的社会警惕。",
	"The Sunweaver holds ultimate authority in Akharin Sangar, which is a theocracy ruled by the god's self-proclaimed messenger. {@creature Atash|JttRC} interprets the Sunweaver's doctrine and encourages all citizens to cultivate light and warmth.

In addition to priestly duties, they act as government officials and judges, employing divination magic in audits and trials.": "太阳神在阿卡林桑加拥有最终的权威，这是一个由神的自称的信使统治的神权。{@creature Atash|JttRC}解释Sunweaver的教义，鼓励所有公民培养光明和温暖。织日者的神职人员拥有重要的权力。除了牧师的职责外，他们还担任政府官员和法官，在审计和审判中运用占卜魔法。",
	"Akharin Sangar flourished during the dynasties that followed but eventually succumbed to excess, corruption, and complacency. Darkness fell upon the city-state, and Zolmate Shab returned.

Once a pile of beans is reduced to 0 hit points, the sous-chefs add the prepared beans to the woks.": "大捆绿色树豆覆盖着两张准备桌。参与者必须用桌上的各种烹饪刀（将其视为{@item Dagger|PHB|daggers}）或他们自己的工具或其他方法切碎或捣碎豆子。每捆豆子都是一个单独的小物体，具有AC 10；hp 15；并且免疫寒冷、毒素和精神伤害。如果一捆豆子受到任何酸性、火焰、闪电、死灵或辐射伤害，它将变得无法使用。一旦一捆豆子的生命值降至0，副厨们就会把准备好的豆子加入炒锅中。",
	"The large tank contains four 8-foot-long jagged koi prawns (use the {@creature giant sea horse} stat block). Participants must slay one of the prawns. Waiting sous-chefs then fish the prawn out and drag it to a wok. The prawns are not initially hostile but defend themselves if they take damage. They have {@quickref cover|PHB|3|0|half cover} from any creature attacking from outside the water.": "这个大水槽里有四只长达8英尺的锯齿锦鲤虾（使用{@creature giant sea horse}的属性块）。参与者必须杀死其中一只虾。等待的厨师助手们会钓起虾并拖到炒锅里。这些虾最初并不敌对，但如果受到伤害会进行自卫。它们对于任何从水外攻击的生物有{@quickref cover|PHB|3|0|half cover}的防御。",
	"The challenge area is depicted on {@adventure map 2.2|JttRC|2|Map 2.2: market challenges} and includes seven rooms. Unlocked doors connect the spaces, all of which are filled with colorful but worthless clutter. The doors are rickety and fit loosely in their frames, allowing tut-krogh caterpillars to move between the rooms unimpeded. Area H1 is lit by a lantern shedding {@quickref Vision and Light|PHB|2||dim light}; the other areas are dark.": "挑战区域显示在{@adventure map 2.2|JttRC|2|Map 2.2: market challenges}上，包括七个房间。未锁的门连接着这些空间，所有房间里都堆满了五颜六色但毫无价值的杂乱物品。门板摇摇欲坠，松松地安在门框里，让图特-克罗格毛毛虫可以自由地在房间之间移动。H1区域由一盏灯笼照亮，照射出{@quickref Vision and Light|PHB|2||dim light}；其他区域都很昏暗。",
	"Once a character finds a tut-krogh, they can convince the caterpillar to come with them by succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Animal Handling}) check. Alternatively, a character can grab a caterpillar by succeeding on a DC 12 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check. A caterpillar flees to an adjoining room if attacked or if a character tries to grab it and misses.": "一旦角色找到了一只图特-克罗格((tut-krogh))，他们可以通过成功进行一次DC 10的感知({@skill Animal Handling})检定来说服这只毛虫跟随他们。另外，角色也可以通过成功进行一次DC 12的敏捷({@skill Sleight of Hand})检定来抓住这只毛虫。如果被攻击或者角色试图抓住它但未成功，毛虫会逃到相邻的房间。",
	"The characters might suspect Kasem is using a creature to harass the Tyenmo and Xungoon market stands—either due to stories from vendors or from what they've witnessed themselves. If a character casts {@spell detect evil and good} near one of the sabotaged stalls, it reveals the presence of a Fey creature nearby, a {@creature wynling|JttRC} drowsing on a nearby stall roof. If approached, the wynling turns {@condition invisible} and flees.": "人物可能会怀疑卡森（Kasem）正在利用一只生物来骚扰泰恩莫（Tyenmo）和逊古恩（Xungoon）的市场摊位——这可能是因为摊贩的故事，或者是他们亲眼目睹的情况。如果一个角色在被破坏的摊位附近施放{@spell detect evil and good}，它会揭示附近有一只精灵生物，一只{@creature wynling|JttRC}正躺在附近的摊位屋顶上。如果接近，这只温灵（wynling）会转{@condition invisible}并逃走。",
	"If characters challenge Kasem with details they learned about him from local vendors, he laughs them off, explaining the market is full of gossip. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check realizes Kasem is hiding something. If the characters confront Kasem with multiple accounts or pieces of evidence, they can coax a confession from him (see the following section). If characters take a more hostile approach, Kasem defends himself. Kasem has the statistics of a {@creature noble} and calls out to three {@creature Wynling|JttRC|wynlings} (presented at the {@area end of this adventure|08e|x}), who appear and aid him.": "如果角色用从当地小贩那里了解到的细节挑战卡森(Kasem)，他会一笑了之，解释市场充满了流言蜚语。一个成功通过DC 10的感知检定({@skill Insight})的角色会意识到卡森在隐瞒什么。如果角色用多个账目或证据质问卡森，他们可以逼出他的供词(见下一节)。如果角色采取更敌对的方式，卡森会为自己辩护。卡森拥有{@creature noble}的统计数据，并呼叫三个{@creature Wynling|JttRC|wynlings}(在{@area end of this adventure|08e|x}呈现)，他们出现并帮助他。",
	"Siabsungkoh is a collectivist society centered on family and deep group loyalties. Families are often blended and can grow through marriage, through adoption, or by simply choosing to accept someone as a family member. Found families are equal to traditional families and often adopt a family name or symbol. The first families that settled Siabsungkoh are said to have been of different blood but the same spirit. Those who operate alone through choice or act in self-serving ways are often called {@i tuah}, which means \"of lonely heart.\"": "Siabsungkoh是一个以家庭和深厚团体忠诚为中心的集体主义社会。家庭经常是混合的，可以通过婚姻、领养或者简单地选择接纳某人作为家庭成员来壮大。被发现的家庭与传统家庭平等，并经常采用一个家族姓氏或符号。据说最早定居Siabsungkoh的家庭是不同血统但有着相同精神的。那些自愿独自行动或以自私方式行事的人通常被称为{@i tuah}，意思是“孤独的心”。",
	"Every year, the Awakening Festival draws folk from across the rich expanse known as Godsbreath, uniting celebrants as they tell their history in song and set the course for the upcoming year. But the mood turns grim when a group of farmers suddenly turns violent, manipulated by an unknown magical malady. In the aftermath, well-known trader {@creature Aunt Dellie|JttRC} fears for her goddaughter {@creature Kianna|JttRC}—a worker at the farm the attackers came from, deep within the outlying farmlands known as the Rattle. When the characters investigate, they are pitted against a lurking evil that uses a young woman's grief and loneliness to lure new victims.": "每年，觉醒节吸引了来自被称为神息之地的广阔地区的人们，团结庆祝者们通过歌曲讲述他们的历史，并为即将到来的一年制定方向。但当一群农民突然变得暴力，被某种未知的魔法疾病操纵时，气氛变得沉重。在事件过后，著名商人{@creature Aunt Dellie|JttRC}担心她的教女{@creature Kianna|JttRC}——一个在袭击者来自的农场工作的女孩，深处被称为响尾蛇的外围农田。当角色们展开调查时，他们将面对一个潜伏的邪恶，利用一位年轻女子的悲伤和孤独来诱使新的受害者。",
	"In the years that followed, more tragedies befell those who came near Cradlelace Lake, as if the buried dead sought to add to their number. Among those lost was a young man named Culley, who vanished into the water in front of his friend {@creature Kianna|JttRC}.": "在接下来的几年里，更多的悲剧降临在那些靠近摇篮蕾丝湖的人身上，仿佛被埋葬的死者想要增加他们的人数一样。在那些失踪的人中，有一个叫 Culley 的年轻人，在他的朋友{@creature Kianna|JttRC}面前消失在水中。",
	"Unlike most lost to the lake, Culley eventually emerged—at least, part of him did. A single Undead hand escaped the lake, and it eventually found others of its kind known as crawling claws. Gradually, these unthinking Undead combined into a soul shaker. Although the mind of this new horror was a fractured amalgam of thoughts, it remembered the lost soul named Culley, whose memories were the seed of its being. It also remembered the last living person Culley ever saw, his dear friend {@creature Kianna|JttRC}.": "与大多数人失踪于湖中不同，卡利最终脱困了——至少，他的一部分脱困了。一只不死之手逃离了湖泊，最终找到了其他同类，被称为爬行之爪。逐渐地，这些无思维的不死生物结合在一起，形成了一个灵魂摇动者。尽管这个新恐怖的思维是一团碎片化的思想，它记得一个叫做卡利的失落灵魂，他的记忆是它存在的种子。它也记得卡利曾经看到的最后一个活着的人，他亲爱的朋友{@creature Kianna|JttRC}。",
