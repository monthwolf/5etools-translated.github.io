	"Trouble darkens the shores of the Vezdali Peninsula when an earthquake hits, sending part of the village of Palma Flora down into the sea. \"Tide of Retribution\" is an adventure that takes characters from 1st to 3rd level. It introduces them to the Menagerie Coast—a tropical region filled with monstrous abominations, mysterious curses, and ancient temples. This setting is ideal for nautical and jungle-exploring adventures.": "一场地震使维兹达利半岛的海岸蒙上了一层阴影，帕尔马-弗洛拉村的一部分被打入了大海。\"报应之潮 \"是一次冒险，需要1到3级的角色。它向他们介绍了Menagerie海岸--一个充满了可怕的憎恶、神秘的诅咒和古老的寺庙的热带地区。这个环境是航海和丛林探险的理想选择。",
	"If your players use the heroic chronicle to create their characters (see {@book chapter 4|EGW|5|Heroic Chronicle}), talk to them about creating characters who grew up on the Menagerie Coast to give them a closer connection to this region. For characters not from the Menagerie Coast, the players should think about why those characters were drawn from across the continent to an idyllic village by the sea.": "如果你的玩家使用英雄编年史来创建他们的角色（见{@book chapter 4|EGW|5|Heroic Chronicle}），就和他们谈谈创建在Menagerie海岸长大的角色，使他们与这个地区有更紧密的联系。对于不是来自Menagerie海岸的角色，玩家应该思考为什么这些角色会被从整个大陆吸引到海边的田园村庄。",
	"The village of Palma Flora is known for its vibrant green foliage, its competitive shark-hunting tournaments, and a sweet cocktail that shares the village's name. Lurking in the Sharkfeather Abyss, an ocean trench just west of the village, is a small clan of some dozen sahuagin that has grown weary of the shark hunters of Palma Flora. Year after year, the sea devils have attacked the shark hunters in an effort to spoil the tournaments, but their small numbers have seen them consistently defeated by the hunters and the village's hired mercenaries. However, things have recently changed.": "帕尔马-弗洛拉村以其充满活力的绿叶、竞争激烈的猎鲨比赛以及与该村同名的甜蜜鸡尾酒而闻名。潜伏在村子西边的鲨鱼羽毛深渊（Sharkfeather Abyss）中的一个由十几个萨瓦金人组成的小部族，已经对帕尔马弗洛拉的猎鲨人感到厌倦。年复一年，海魔袭击了猎鲨人，试图破坏比赛，但他们人数少，一直被猎鲨人和村里雇佣的雇佣兵打败了。然而，事情最近发生了变化。",
	"When a young sahuagin named Selachai lost her parents in a raid against the shark hunters during last year's tournament, her distraught prayers for vengeance touched the fathomless consciousness of Uk'otoa, an ancient leviathan trapped beneath the ocean. Selachai beseeched her new patron for the power to destroy the shark hunters and all who exploit the sea. She received that power in the form of a magic scepter tipped with a crystalline amber eye. Transformed by the scepter into a conduit for Uk'otoa's might, Selachai now leads the Sharkfeather clan on a path of dark retribution, and it's up to the adventurers to stop it.": "当一个名叫塞拉柴的年轻萨瓦金人在去年的比赛中对猎鲨者的突袭中失去了她的父母时，她心急如焚的复仇祈祷触动了Uk'otoa深不可测的意识，它是一只被困在海洋下的古老的利维坦。塞拉柴恳求她的新赞助人给予她力量，以摧毁猎鲨者和所有剥削海洋的人。她得到了这种力量，那是一根带有琥珀色结晶眼睛的魔法权杖的形式。塞拉柴被权杖转化为乌克奥托亚的力量的通道，现在她带领鲨羽族走上了一条黑暗的复仇之路，而冒险家们要做的就是阻止它。",
	"In the first part of the adventure, the characters are enjoying a day of relaxation or invigorating shark hunting on the sunny shores of Palma Flora when a ground-quaking tremor rocks the coast. Before their eyes, the island-based portion of the village begins to sink into the depths. Sahuagin prowl the waters, eviscerating those who try to swim to safety. The characters must fight to survive and have a chance to save as many villagers as they can before Palma Flora is overrun.": "在冒险的第一部分，主人公们正在帕尔马弗洛拉阳光明媚的海岸上享受一天的放松或振奋人心的猎鲨活动，这时，一场地动山摇的震荡震撼了海岸。在他们眼前，村子里以岛为单位的部分开始沉入深海。萨瓦金人在水中游荡，将那些试图游到安全地带的人斩尽杀绝。这些人物必须为生存而战，并有机会在帕尔马弗洛拉被淹没之前尽可能多地拯救村民。",
	"In the end, the characters must leap aboard a ship fleeing the sinking village before they are overwhelmed. If they survive this attack and make it to the open water, they reach 2nd level. While aboard the ship, the characters interact with the crew and their mysterious tabaxi captain as they plan their next moves.": "最后，人物必须在被淹没之前跳上一艘逃离沉没村庄的船。如果他们在这次攻击中幸存下来，并成功到达开放水域，他们就会达到第二级。在船上，人物在计划下一步行动时与船员和神秘的Tabaxi船长互动。",
	"Returning to the watery ruins of Palma Flora, the characters face off against their sahuagin foes. The battle is vicious, as many of Palma Flora's shark hunters have been twisted by eldritch power into half-humanoid, half-shark abominations. No matter the outcome of the final battle, the adventurers are set up to continue their nautical adventures along the Menagerie Coast.": "回到帕尔马-弗洛拉（Palma Flora）的水中废墟，角色们与他们的萨瓦金敌人对峙。这场战斗非常凶险，因为帕尔马弗洛拉的许多猎鲨人已经被长生的力量扭曲成半人半鲨的怪物。无论最后的战斗结果如何，冒险者们都被安排继续他们在Menagerie海岸的航海冒险。",
	"Before beginning the adventure, work with your players as they talk about why their characters are in Palma Flora. You can provide players with some details regarding the village as it's described in {@book chapter 3|EGW|4|Palma Flora}. This can help the players get into character and help you establish why the party has come to this remote coastal village.": "在开始冒险之前，当你的玩家谈论他们的角色为什么在帕尔马弗洛拉时，与他们一起工作。你可以向玩家提供一些关于这个村庄的细节，就像{@book chapter 3|EGW|4|Palma Flora}中描述的那样。这可以帮助玩家进入角色，并帮助你确定为什么队伍会来到这个偏远的沿海村庄。",
	"This is also a good time to figure out if the characters already know each other or if this adventure is the first time they've met.": "这也是一个很好的时机，可以弄清楚这些人物是否已经认识对方，或者这次冒险是他们第一次见面。",
	"Once the players are ready to begin, read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:": "一旦玩家准备好开始，就读或转述以下内容来设定场景。",

A half-dozen nearly naked shark hunters preparing to compete in the annual tournament stand in the shallows on the south shore, armed with harpoons and their wits.": "凉爽的微风飘过弗洛拉岛，将鲜花的甜美气息与卢西德海洋的咸味混合在一起。皮肤黝黑的当地人在海滩上玩耍，而被晒伤的游客则坐在柳条椅上，喝着冷饮。半打几乎全裸的猎鲨者准备参加年度比赛，他们站在南岸的浅滩上，拿着鱼叉和他们的智慧。",
	"The players now have the chance to describe what their characters are doing in the scene you've established. Your group can play out these scenes as short vignettes, with each player establishing what a normal day is like for the characters before the action begins.": "玩家现在有机会描述他们的角色在你建立的场景中正在做什么。你的小组可以把这些场景作为简短的小插曲，在行动开始之前，每个玩家都要确定角色的正常一天是什么样的。",

	"The ground beneath your feet trembles and cracks. Waves a dozen feet high crash into the shore, and the sound of screaming fills the air as a stampede of beachgoers flees the sands. A chorus of shrieks add to the cacophony as shark hunters run from the water, pursued by humanoid creatures with fish-like heads and slick, rubbery skin.": "你脚下的地面在颤抖，出现裂缝。十几英尺高的海浪冲击着海岸，尖叫声充斥着空气，海滩上的人们纷纷逃离沙滩。鲨鱼猎人从水里跑出来，被长着鱼一样的头和滑溜溜的橡胶皮肤的人形生物追赶，一阵阵的尖叫声让这一片喧嚣变得更加热闹。",
	"Ask each player how their character reacts. If any of the characters want to fight the sahuagin, tell the players to roll initiative. The action of this adventure begins in the south part of the village (area P1, described below).": "问每个玩家他们的角色是如何反应的。如果有哪个角色想和萨瓦金人战斗，就告诉玩家要掷出主动权。这次冒险的行动开始于村庄的南部（P1区，如下所述）。",
	"The characters might not be interested in saving the shark hunters, perhaps feeling that people not afraid to hunt sharks can fend for themselves. In that case, let them ask you questions about what else is happening in the village. The players might decide that their characters want to focus on saving villagers, raiding houses, or performing any other noble or selfish deeds as the village falls into chaos. In this event, refer to the map of Palma Flora and the following general features to answer their questions.": "人物可能对拯救捕鲨者不感兴趣，也许觉得不怕捕鲨的人可以自食其力。在这种情况下，让他们问你关于村子里还发生了什么的问题。玩家们可能会决定，他们的角色想在村子陷入混乱时集中精力拯救村民，袭击房屋，或做任何其他高尚或自私的事。在这种情况下，参考帕尔马弗洛拉的地图和以下一般特征来回答他们的问题。",

	"The two shark hunters are reckless human teenagers—a female half-elf named Elanza and a male tiefling named Joao. Elanza fears that the entire village will sink into the sea, and she urges the characters to accompany her to the ships on the eastern shore and escape. Joao is obsessed with glory. If he survives this encounter, he heads for the north shore to keep fighting unless a character can convince him to flee to safety with a successful DC 10 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check.": "这两个捕鲨者是鲁莽的人类少年--一个叫埃兰萨的女性半精灵和一个叫若昂的男性铁皮人。伊兰莎担心整个村子会沉入大海，她敦促人物陪她到东岸的船上去，然后逃跑。乔奥对荣誉很着迷。如果他在这次遭遇中幸存下来，他就会前往北岸继续战斗，除非有角色能成功地用DC10魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查说服他逃到安全地带。",

	"Three {@creature Reef Shark||reef sharks}—all telepathically commanded by a {@creature sahuagin} lurking underwater—attack the six {@creature Commoner||commoners} swimming through the channel. One commoner is 35 feet across the channel and can reach the other side on their next turn. The other five villagers are only 25 feet across and are unsure whether to turn back or keep swimming.

	"Any villagers who are saved promise the characters that they'll remember their bravery.

(The rod is a new magic item detailed in {@book chapter 6|EGW|7|Rod of Retribution}.)": "一个名叫塞拉柴的年轻女性萨瓦金人最近掌管了鲨鱼鳍部族，并拥有不寻常的力量。她带着一根被公认为{@item rod of retribution|EGW}的魔法权杖，这根权杖已经成为了超凡脱俗的魔法力量的通道。(棍子是一种新的魔法物品，在{@book chapter 6|EGW|7|Rod of Retribution}中作了详细说明）。",
	"No one knows exactly how this young sahuagin managed to cause an earthquake powerful enough to drag Flora Isle under the waves, but that isn't important. What is important is finding a way to delve beneath those waves and take the scepter from Selachai. Doing so would stop her from causing any more chaos, and the relic would doubtlessly sell for a pretty penny on the black market.": "没有人知道这个年轻的萨瓦金人究竟是如何设法引起一场足以将弗洛拉岛拖入海浪之下的地震的，但这并不重要。重要的是找到一种方法，深入到那些海浪之下，从塞拉柴手中夺取权杖。这样做可以阻止她造成更多的混乱，而且这个遗物无疑会在黑市上卖得很便宜。",
	"{@creature Three Earrings|EGW} wants to sell the treasure and split it three ways—a third to her and the ship's upkeep, a third to the crew, and a third to the adventurers. She offers them a total of 500 gp as their one-third share if they help her retrieve the rod.": "{@creature Three Earrings|EGW}想把宝藏卖掉，然后分成三份--三分之一给她和船的维修费，三分之一给船员，三分之一给冒险者。如果他们帮助她找回鱼竿，她会给他们总共500金币作为他们的三分之一份额。",
	"A number of nearby ports or islands are good sites for {@i Wavechaser} to dock, unload its refugees, and find gear that could help a group of brave adventurers take on the sahuagin in their underwater lair.": "附近的一些港口或岛屿是{@i Wavechaser}停靠的好地方，可以卸下难民，并找到可以帮助一群勇敢的冒险者在水下巢穴中对付萨瓦金的装备。",
	"If the characters tell {@creature Three Earrings|EGW} that they want to challenge Selachai, she lays out several of the ports of call they could visit before turning about and sailing for the Sharkfeather Abyss. If the adventurers would rather leave this mess behind them, she scowls and scoffs, but eventually acquiesces. The captain agrees to drop the party off in Port Damali, where she hopes to find \"a few sellswords with real courage.\"": "如果人物告诉{@creature Three Earrings|EGW}他们想挑战塞拉柴，她会列出几个他们可以访问的港口，然后转身驶向鲨羽深渊。如果冒险家们宁愿把这个烂摊子留在身后，她会皱着眉头嘲笑，但最终还是默许了。船长同意让他们在达玛利港下车，她希望能在那里找到 \"几个真正有勇气的卖家\"。",
	"For characters set on returning to Flora Isle and facing down the sahuagin threat, three viable ports are close by, any of which would take in the refugees and let the characters seek supplies for their mission. {@book Chapter 3|EGW|4|Menagerie Coast} has more information about all the following locations:": "对于准备返回弗洛拉岛并面对萨瓦金人的威胁的角色来说，有三个可行的港口在附近，其中任何一个都可以接收难民，让角色为他们的任务寻找补给。{@book Chapter 3|EGW|4|Menagerie Coast}有关于以下所有地点的更多信息。",
	"This tiny island has a small port. A shaman living in the hills beyond the port might be able to provide the characters with a charm of water breathing (see \"{@book Charms|DMG|7|Charms}\" in chapter 7 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}). The charm allows the character to cast the {@spell water breathing} spell, after which its magic fades.": "这个小岛上有一个小港口。住在港口外山上的萨满可能会给人物提供一个水呼吸的符咒（见《{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}》第七章的\"{@book Charms|DMG|7|Charms}\"）。这个符咒可以让人物施展{@spell water breathing}的法术，之后其魔力就会消失。",
	"This village is the smallest settlement recognized by the Clovis Concord but is nonetheless filled with foreign ships. An apothecary here might be able to provide potions that would grant the ability to breathe underwater.": "这个村子是克洛维协约承认的最小的定居点，但还是有很多外国船只。这里的药剂师也许能提供能赋予水下呼吸能力的药水。",
	"This city is too large for the characters to fully explore in this adventure. {@creature Three Earrings|EGW} knows a smith with black-market connections, and who can help the characters obtain a number of experimental diving helmets that would allow them to breathe beneath the waves.": "这个城市太大，人物无法在这次冒险中完全探索。{@creature Three Earrings|EGW}认识一个与黑市有联系的铁匠，他可以帮助人物获得一些实验性的潜水头盔，让他们可以在海里呼吸。",
	"As thanks for their bravery, the characters are offered the use of a cramped but comfortable spare cabin as sleeping quarters. Unless {@creature Three Earrings|EGW} visits one of the characters (see \"{@adventure Three Earrings's Plan|ToR|0|Three Earrings's Plan}\" earlier in this adventure), the night passes uneventfully. Read:": "为了感谢他们的勇敢，他们被提供了一个狭窄但舒适的备用舱作为睡觉的地方。除非{@creature Three Earrings|EGW}来拜访其中一个角色（见本冒险故事前面的\"{@adventure Three Earrings's Plan|ToR|0|Three Earrings's Plan}\"），否则这一夜都是平淡无奇的。阅读。",
	"Seagulls squawk and chase behind you as {@i Wavechaser} sails on to your next port of call. Night settles around you, the crew guided only by the light of the stars.": "海鸥在你身后鸣叫和追逐，(%)驶向你的下一个停靠港。夜晚在你周围沉淀下来，船员们只靠星星的光亮来指引。",
	"The characters' decision on where to travel next might be the point that marks the end of the first session of this adventure. If you ended the first session before completing this section, this is still a good place to take a short break before continuing into the next part of the adventure. Remember that the characters should now be 2nd level.": "角色们对下一步去哪里旅行的决定可能是标志着这次冒险的第一个环节结束的点。如果你在完成这一部分之前就结束了第一节，那么在继续进入冒险的下一部分之前，这里仍然是一个短暂休息的好地方。记住，现在的角色应该是2级。",
	"Once the players are ready to begin this last section of the adventure, read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:": "一旦玩家准备好开始冒险的最后一节，就读出或转述以下内容来设置场景。",
	"\"Wake up, travelers!\" The voice of Boerth, one of {@i Wavechaser}'s crew members, rouses you from slumber. The sun is barely above the horizon, but you can just make out the docks of a port through the porthole window of your cabin. \"It's past dawn and time to get moving.\"": "\"醒醒吧，旅行者！\" 波尔士的声音，一个{@i Wavechaser}的船员，把你从睡梦中唤醒。太阳几乎没有超过地平线，但你可以通过船舱的舷窗看到一个港口的码头。\"天亮了，该动身了。\"",
	"When the adventurers emerge from their cabin, they find that the refugees from Palma Flora are packing up the few possessions they were able to save. They thank the characters again for their rescue before going ashore. One of the refugees has business contacts in the port, and can arrange to help the other refugees find shelter and plan their next moves. He is also able to draw on funds as a final reward for the characters' assistance—5 gp per refugee brought on board.": "当冒险家们从船舱里出来时，他们发现来自帕尔马-弗洛拉的难民们正在收拾他们得以保存的少数财产。他们在上岸前再次感谢这些人物对他们的救援。其中一个难民在港口有业务联系，可以安排帮助其他难民找到住所并计划他们的下一步行动。他还可以提取资金作为对人物援助的最后奖励--每个被带上船的难民5戈比。",
	"If the characters made friends with any of these NPCs and want them to stay, they can encourage them to hang around the ship and continue traveling with them. Otherwise, all the refugees leave the adventure here. You can reintroduce these NPCs when the characters return to any port in the Clovis Concord, if either you or the players want to see them again.": "如果人物与这些NPC中的任何一个交了朋友，并希望他们留下来，他们可以鼓励他们在船上闲逛，并继续与他们一起旅行。否则，所有的难民都会在这里离开冒险。当人物回到Clovis Concord的任何港口时，如果你或玩家想再见到他们，你可以重新介绍这些NPC。",
	"An important part of being a Dungeon Master is knowing how to present the players with choices while also not forcing yourself to do more work than you have to. Allowing players the option of visiting three different ports is potentially a huge amount of work, even with the help of a book such as this one. To minimize the amount of preparation you have to do, a generic settlement with several shops and locations is presented here. Short descriptions then talk about how to make each possible settlement unique.": "作为地下城管理员的一个重要部分是知道如何向玩家提供选择，同时也不强迫自己做更多的工作。允许玩家选择访问三个不同的港口可能是一个巨大的工作量，即使有像这本书这样的帮助。为了尽量减少你要做的准备工作，这里介绍了一个有几个商店和地点的通用定居点。然后，简短的描述谈到了如何使每个可能的定居点变得独特。",
	"{@creature Three Earrings|EGW} is in something of a rush and suggests that the characters not spend too much time on shore—or she'll leave without them. This makes exploring the larger cities of Port Damali and Port Zoon less appealing, at least for now.": "{@creature Three Earrings|EGW}很着急，建议人物不要在岸上花太多时间，否则她会丢下他们离开。这使得探索达马利港和祖恩港这些较大的城市变得不那么有吸引力，至少目前是这样。",
	"All the ports that the characters can visit in this section have the following general features. The specific information on the three ports, below, tells you how these general features and their NPCs are modified for each port.": "本节中人物可以访问的所有港口都有以下一般特征。下面关于三个港口的具体信息，告诉你这些一般特征和它们的NPC是如何为每个港口修改的。",
	"The port has a general goods store, which sells items in the \"{@book Adventuring Gear|PHB|5|Adventuring Gear}\" section in chapter 5 of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} worth 50 gp or less. The store's clerk (use the {@creature commoner} stat block) has four of each item in stock. Characters can also sell items to the general goods store for half their price in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}.": "港口有一家杂货店，出售{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}第五章中\"{@book Adventuring Gear|PHB|5|Adventuring Gear} \"部分的物品，价值50GP或以下。商店的店员（使用{@creature commoner}状态块）每种物品都有四个库存。角色也可以在{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中以一半的价格向杂货店出售物品。",
	"The port has a shop that sells magic scrolls. The scribe here (use the {@creature mage} stat block) has four spell scrolls for sale at a cost of 50 gp each: one {@item spell scroll} of {@spell magic missile}, one of {@spell shield}, one of {@spell guiding bolt}, and one of {@spell thunderwave}.": "这个港口有一家卖魔法卷轴的商店。这里的抄写员（使用{@creature mage}状态块）有四张法术卷轴出售，每张花费50金币：一张{@item spell scroll}的{@spell magic missile}，一张{@spell shield}，一张{@spell guiding bolt}，还有一张{@spell thunderwave}的。",
	"In addition to the general features noted above, the port of Bisaft Isle has the following features.": "除了上述的一般特征外，比萨夫特岛的港口还有以下特征。",
	"Bisaft Isle is warm and balmy, particularly in the early morning. The whole port smells of fresh rain. Its people are wary of {@creature Three Earrings|EGW}, but are kind to visitors and refugees.": "比萨夫特岛温暖和煦，尤其是在清晨。整个港口都有新雨的味道。它的人们对{@creature Three Earrings|EGW}很警惕，但对游客和难民很友好。",
	"The scrollery is a mile from the harbor and is run by an old female tortle shaman named Grimalda (use the {@creature mage} stat block). She owes Three Earrings a favor and grants one party member a {@i charm of water breathing }(see \"{@book Charms|DMG|7|Charms}\" in chapter 7 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}). The charm allows the character to cast the {@spell water breathing} spell, after which its magic fades.": "这个卷轴厂离港口有一英里远，由一个名叫格里马达的老女托尔萨满（使用{@creature mage}状态块）经营。她欠三只耳环一个人情，并授予一名党员一个{@i charm of water breathing }(见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}第七章中的\"{@book Charms|DMG|7|Charms}\")。该符咒允许该人物施展{@spell water breathing}的法术，之后其魔力就会消失。",
	"In addition to the general features noted above, Brokenbank has the following features.": "除了上面提到的一般特征外，Brokenbank还有以下特征。",
	"Brokenbank is a muddy, rain-slick village crammed full of travelers. It can feel claustrophobic, and it seems as though a leering Zhelezo guard stands on every street corner.": "Brokenbank是一个泥泞的、被雨淋湿的村庄，挤满了旅行者。它可以让人感到幽闭恐惧，而且似乎每个街角都站着一个猥琐的哲勒索警卫。",
	"Brokenbank features a thriving pawn shop that doubles as its general store. Items sold here fetch 75 percent of their value rather than 50 percent.": "Brokenbank有一个繁荣的当铺，同时也是其综合商店。这里出售的物品可以获得其价值的75%，而不是50%。",
	"In addition to the general features noted above, Port Damali has the following features.": "除了上述的一般特征外，达马里港还有以下特征。",
	"Port Damali is a beautiful and lively city, but its docks are smelly, weather-beaten, and dangerous.": "达马利港是一个美丽而活泼的城市，但它的码头却臭气熏天，饱经风霜，而且很危险。",
	"The local smithy has received several experimental breathing helmets from inventors in Port Zoon. {@creature Three Earrings|EGW} gives a letter to the adventurers and asks that they deliver it to the smith without opening it. (The letter reads: \"The Revelry is requisitioning your supply of diving helmets. Ask no questions, and your next shipment will arrive unharried.\")": "当地的铁匠铺从祖恩港的发明家那里得到了几个实验性的呼吸头盔。{@creature Three Earrings|EGW}给了冒险者一封信，要求他们把信交给铁匠，不要打开。(信中写道。\"狂欢号正在征用你的潜水头盔的供应。不要问问题，你的下一批货物会顺利到达。\")",
	"Once the characters have concluded their business in port, {@creature Three Earrings|EGW} looks sternly at them and asks, \"Are you prepared? You're about to risk life and limb for naught but treasure and a sense of vengeance. The only folk who would do such a thing are the greedy, the foolish, and those with nothing left to lose.\"": "一旦这些人物结束了他们在港口的业务，{@creature Three Earrings|EGW}严厉地看着他们并问道：\"你们准备好了吗？你们要冒着生命和肢体的危险，只为了财宝和复仇的感觉。只有贪婪的人、愚蠢的人和一无所有的人才会做这样的事。",
	"Against her own nature, {@creature Three Earrings|EGW} has taken a liking to these adventurers (unless they have done something to annoy her) and is having second thoughts about using them as disposable tools in her attempt to gain the {@item rod of retribution|EGW}.": "与她自己的本性相反，{@creature Three Earrings|EGW}对这些冒险者产生了好感（除非他们做了什么让她恼火的事），并且在试图获得{@item rod of retribution|EGW}的过程中，对把他们作为一次性的工具有了新的想法。",
	"In the middle of the night, one day after {@i Wavechaser} leaves port, the ship's navigator, Kijori, shouts out a warning. Another ship has emerged from behind a tall rock formation and is moving to intercept!": "在半夜，在{@i Wavechaser}离港后的一天，船上的导航员Kijori喊出了一个警告。另一艘船从一个高大的岩层后面出现，正在移动，准备拦截!",
	"This encounter provides a means of breaking up travel and for deepening the intrigue surrounding Three Earrings. If your group wants to finish the rest of this adventure in a single game session and is pressed for time, consider skipping this encounter.": "这场遭遇战提供了一种打破旅行的手段，并加深了围绕三只耳环的阴谋。如果你的团队想在一个游戏环节中完成这个冒险的其余部分，并且时间紧迫，可以考虑跳过这个遭遇战。",
	"The intercepting ship, named {@i Moonbeam}, is a caravel flying the colors of the Clovis Concord, the government of the Menagerie Coast. The craft is slightly smaller than {@i Wavechaser} and is gaining on her rapidly.": "拦截的船只名为{@i Moonbeam}，是一艘悬挂Clovis Concord颜色的船，是Menagerie海岸的政府。这艘船比{@i Wavechaser}略小，正在迅速地追赶她。",
	"{@i Moonbeam} is on the hunt for {@creature Three Earrings|EGW} and is captained by Lieutenant Commander Voskiir Larth, a princely and flamboyant pale-skinned, male half-elf {@creature bandit captain}. {@i Wavechaser}'s druid crew member Dajarkal, a spy for the Clovis Concord, has reported the ship's movements by way of her animal messengers, and {@i Moonbeam} has been sent to intercept the secret pirate vessel.": "{@i Moonbeam}正在追捕{@creature Three Earrings|EGW}，船长是少校Voskiir Larth，一个白皮肤的男性半精灵{@creature bandit captain}，很有王子风范。{@i Wavechaser}的德鲁伊船员Dajarkal是Clovis Concord的间谍，通过她的动物信使报告了这艘船的动向，{@i Moonbeam}被派去拦截这艘秘密海盗船。",
	"It takes {@i Moonbeam} 10 minutes to intercept {@i Wavechaser}, giving the characters and the crew time to wake up and don their armor (see \"{@book Getting Into and Out of Armor|PHB|5|Getting Into and Out of Armor}\" in chapter 5 of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}). Combat begins when Voskiir and his boarding party of two {@creature Thug||thugs}, two {@creature Scout||scouts}, and four {@creature Bandit||bandits} swing aboard the vessel. He shouts out, \"In the name of the laws of the Clovis Concord, surrender your vessel peacefully, or we shall take her!\"": "拦截{@i Wavechaser}需要{@i Moonbeam}10分钟，让角色和船员有时间醒来并穿上盔甲（见{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}第五章的\"{@book Getting Into and Out of Armor|PHB|5|Getting Into and Out of Armor}\"）。战斗开始时，沃斯基尔和他的2人（4%）、2人（5%）、4人（6%）的登船队大摇大摆地登上了船只。他大声喊道：\"以克洛维康科德的法律之名，和平地交出你的船只，否则我们将夺取她！\"",
	"{@creature Three Earrings|EGW} keeps a low profile at the start of the fight, skulking in the shadows and hoping that the crew and the characters can convince Voskiir he's grabbed up the wrong ship. However, the commander responds to the slightest provocation with overzealous force. If the characters or crew react with confusion or try to talk things out with him, he refuses to listen and attacks outright. Use the map of {@i Wavechaser} to judge the positions of the characters, their allies, and their enemies in this combat.": "{@creature Three Earrings|EGW}在战斗开始时保持低调，潜伏在暗处，希望船员和人物能说服沃斯基尔他抓错了船。然而，指挥官对最轻微的挑衅都会做出过度热情的反应。如果角色或船员的反应是困惑，或试图与他谈一谈，他就拒绝听，并直接攻击。使用{@i Wavechaser}的地图来判断这场战斗中人物、他们的盟友和敌人的位置。",
	"Running a combat with several allied NPCs can be complicated. To simplify this situation, have the four bandits on Voskiir's crew engage Boerth, Dajarkal, Dillyu, and Kijori, while {@creature Three Earrings|EGW} fights from the shadows and Heidi stays at the helm to steer the vessel. This leaves the characters to take on Voskiir at the center of the fight. You can resolve these one-on-one duels using dice as normal if you wish, or you can declare that one side defeats the other depending on how the characters conclude their battle with Voskiir.": "与几个盟友的NPC进行战斗会很复杂。为了简化这种情况，让Voskiir船员中的四个强盗与Boerth、Dajarkal、Dillyu和Kijori交战，而{@creature Three Earrings|EGW}则在暗处作战，Heidi则留在舵手处驾驶船只。这就使人物在战斗的中心对上了沃斯基尔。如果你愿意，你可以用骰子来解决这些一对一的决斗，或者你可以宣布一方击败另一方，这取决于人物如何结束与沃斯基尔的战斗。",
	"Dajarkal and Dillyu are wild cards in the battle, and can be used as you see fit. Dajarkal is a mercenary with no real alliance to the Clovis Concord, so she might hang back at first to see which side gains the upper hand. Dillyu might need to have a character convince him to fight on their side before he joins the fray.": "达贾卡尔和迪利乌是这场战斗中的外卡，可以根据你的需要使用。达贾卡尔是一个雇佣兵，与克洛维协约没有真正的联盟关系，所以她一开始可能会挂在后面，看哪一方占了上风。Dillyu可能需要有一个角色说服他在加入战斗之前站在他们一边。",
	"Combat ends when Voskiir and his boarding party are defeated. {@i Moonbeam} sails away with all haste once the battle is lost, but {@i Wavechaser} doesn't follow. If the boarding party is killed, that's the end of that. If the adventurers capture Voskiir, however, they have the chance to interrogate him. (You can also have Dajarkal or one of Voskiir's crew know what he knows if the captain didn't survive.)": "战斗在沃斯基尔和他的登船队被击败后结束。一旦战斗失败，{@i Moonbeam}就会急速驶离，但{@i Wavechaser}不会跟随。如果登船队被杀，那就结束了。不过，如果冒险者们抓住了沃斯基尔，他们就有机会审问他了。(如果船长没有活下来，你也可以让达加尔或沃斯基尔的一个船员知道他所知道的事情)。",
	"Voskiir offers up willingly that {@creature Three Earrings|EGW} is a Revelry pirate and that he is an officer of the Zhelezo sent to apprehend her. If the characters try to get more out of him, you can cut things short by having Three Earrings appear and order one of her crew to \"Throw this wretched do-gooder in the brig.\"": "沃斯基尔心甘情愿地提供了{@creature Three Earrings|EGW}是一个瑞弗里海盗，他是哲勒索号派来逮捕她的官员。如果人物试图从他那里得到更多信息，你可以让三只耳环出现并命令她的一个船员 \"把这个可恶的好人扔进船舱\"，以此来缩短事情的发展。",
	"The winds favor the characters on their return journey, and they arrive at the sunken ruins of Flora Isle at dawn on the third day of travel. When the characters arrive at Palma Flora and the Sharkfeather Abyss, read:": "风向有利于人物的回程，他们在旅行的第三天黎明时分到达了弗洛拉岛的沉没废墟。当人物到达帕尔马-弗洛拉和鲨羽深渊时，阅读。",

	"The crew moves to the starboard side of the ship to look across the waves as the first light of dawn creeps over the horizon. Along the distant coast, you can make out the mainland section of Palma Flora, which is intact but appears deserted, its residents presumably having fled in case of another sahuagin attack. The waters around the ship are murky and marked by only a few stray scraps of driftwood bobbing lazily on the surface.": "当黎明的第一道曙光爬上地平线时，船员们移到船的右舷，向对面的海浪望去。沿着遥远的海岸线，你可以看到帕尔马-弗洛拉的大陆部分，它完好无损，但似乎被遗弃了，它的居民可能已经逃离，以防再次受到萨瓦金人的攻击。船只周围的水域很浑浊，只有一些零星的浮木碎片在水面上懒洋洋地晃动。",
	"You spot movement out of the corner of your eye. Something is climbing aboard the ship from the port side—a small party of sahuagin! Close behind them are two hulking, shark-headed humanoids.": "你从眼角的余光中发现了动静。有东西正从左舷爬上船来--一小队萨瓦金人！在他们身后是两个巨大的鲨鱼头人形生物。他们身后是两个巨大的鲨鱼头的人形生物。",
	"These monsters attack at once. If no one notices the eight {@creature sahuagin} and two {@creature Sharkbody Abomination|EGW|sharkbody abominations} (see the \"Sharkbody Abominations\" sidebar) as they clamber aboard {@i Wavechaser}, they surprise the characters and the crew. As with the previous encounter, you can streamline this encounter by having some of the sahuagin engage the crew of {@i Wavechaser} one-on-one.": "这些怪物会立即发动攻击。如果没有人注意到这八只{@creature sahuagin}和两只{@creature Sharkbody Abomination|EGW|sharkbody abominations}（见 \"鲨鱼体憎恶 \"侧边栏）爬上{@i Wavechaser}时，它们会给角色和船员带来惊喜。和之前的遭遇一样，你可以通过让一些萨瓦金人与{@i Wavechaser}的船员进行一对一的交流来简化这次遭遇。",
	"The sahuagin leap overboard and flee into the sea when the first of the abominations is killed. As they flee, {@creature Three Earrings|EGW} emerges from below decks and shouts, \"Adventurers! Use the supplies we've acquired and follow them into the trench!

	"The sahuagin shaman Selachai tapped into Uk'otoa's magic to wreak vengeance on the shark hunters of Palma Flora.

Selachai orders the sharkbody abominations to put the characters out of commission.": "战斗一开始，塞拉柴就命令她的萨瓦金祈求者保护她。然而，他们没有一个人动身去攻击。相反，他们站在离她20英尺远的地方，仍然跪着，打算放弃自己的生命来保护她。塞拉柴命令鲨鱼体的憎恶者让这些人物失去作用。",
	"Selachai is a young adult sahuagin who commands the respect of her clan. She came into a position of leadership by defeating the clan's previous priestess in ritual combat, using the powers granted to her by Uk'otoa. Everything she has in life, she has had to fight for, but this hasn't hardened her heart. Rather, she wishes to create a better life for her people.": "塞拉柴是一个年轻的成年萨瓦金人，她得到了族人的尊重。她利用乌克托亚赋予她的力量，在仪式战斗中击败了该族的前任女祭司，从而走上了领导岗位。她在生活中所拥有的一切，都是她不得不为之奋斗的，但这并没有使她的心变硬。相反，她希望为她的人民创造一个更好的生活。",

	"If the characters were defeated by Selachai and her sahuagin, all is not lost. The warlock is no stranger to killing, but she recognizes an opportunity when it appears before her. She commands her minions to bind the characters, stabilize them, and carry their {@condition unconscious} forms to the surface.": "如果这些人物被塞拉柴和她的萨瓦金打败了，那么一切都没有失去。术士对杀戮并不陌生，但当机会出现在她面前时，她会意识到它的存在。她命令她的爪牙捆绑住这些人物，稳定他们，并把他们的{@condition unconscious}形态带到地面。",

	"The sahuagin priestess emerges from the water to face you, her mouth spreading into a huge grin that reveals her needle-like teeth. In fractured Common, she says, \"I could use the help of land walkers like you. The surface dwellers and boat riders hunt us with their hooks and harpoons, but they trust you. Take my hand. We don't need to fight. I can tell you so many tales of the land walkers' evil.\"": "萨瓦金女祭司从水中走出来，面对你，她的嘴张开成一个巨大的笑脸，露出针状的牙齿。她用断断续续的普通话说：\"我可以利用像你这样的陆地行者的帮助。水面上的居民和乘船者用他们的钩子和鱼叉猎杀我们，但他们信任你。抓住我的手。我们不需要战斗。我可以告诉你许多关于陆地行者的邪恶故事。\"",
	"This ending sets up future adventures along the Menagerie Coast. As a DM, you can have fun with the elusive morality of Selachai and the sahuagin, and of the Clovis Concord. Who are the real villains. Are either of these factions truly good or evil? What of {@creature Three Earrings|EGW} and the Revelry pirates? All these dangling plot threads offer hints of new stories that you can guide your players toward, or which they can seek out of their own volition.": "这个结局为今后沿着Menagerie海岸的冒险做了铺垫。作为DM，你可以对Selachai和sahuagin以及Clovis Concord的难以捉摸的道德感感到有趣。谁才是真正的恶棍。这些派别中的任何一个是真正的善还是恶？{@creature Three Earrings|EGW}和Revelry海盗的情况如何？所有这些悬而未决的情节线索提供了新故事的暗示，你可以引导你的玩家走向这些故事，或者他们可以自己主动去寻找。",
	"If any of the characters convinced {@creature Three Earrings|EGW} not to think of them as pawns earlier in the adventure, she resolves to treat all the characters as friends now. She welcomes them back onto {@i Wavechaser} with a huge smile, then asks the adventurers to come with her to the pirate haven of Darktow. \"There's no use in being subtle about it,\" she says with a shrug. \"I need to fence this thing in order to get you your gold.

	"If the characters go with Three Earrings, she is true to her word. She even invites the party to join her as pirates on {@i Wavechaser}—and hints that they could earn the command of their own ship if they stick with her. From this point, your campaign can continue with the characters as pirates along the Menagerie Coast, or they could mutiny and try to take {@i Wavechaser} for themselves.": "如果角色们跟着 \"三只耳环 \"走，她就会信守诺言。她甚至邀请大家加入她的行列，成为{@i Wavechaser}的海盗--并暗示说如果他们坚持和她在一起，就能获得自己的船的指挥权。从这一点上看，你的战役可以继续进行，人物可以沿着Menagerie海岸当海盗，或者他们可以叛变并试图为自己夺取{@i Wavechaser}。",
	"If {@creature Three Earrings|EGW} wasn't convinced to value the adventurers as her friends, she demands that they give her the rod. If they don't hand it over, she threatens to take it by force.

	"If the adventure ends this way, the characters are in a rough spot. Their next destination is a prison—and possibly an execution—in Darktow.

The choice is yours!": "如果冒险以这种方式结束，人物就会陷入困境。他们的下一个目的地是监狱，也可能是在Darktow被处决。他们可能不得不加入Revelry，或者试图逃离监狱，偷渡到一艘海盗船上。或者，也许{@i Moonbeam}会返回并在返回Darktow时拦截{@i Wavechaser}。选择权在你手中!",
