	"More than one thousand years ago, the wizard {@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} (see {@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}) journeyed from a distant land to the base of Mount Waterdeep, perhaps acceding to the whispered summons of providence. Some believe he hailed from the nearly forgotten empire known as the Cradlelands. In ages past, humanity spread from the Cradlelands across Faerûn, originating from what is now the Plains of Purple Dust, a wasteland birthed out of a conflict with the gods. Others give Halaster less ancient origins, placing him among the early wizards of Netheril, or asserting that he came from a southern nation long since buried by sand and time. Whatever his origin, scholars have recorded that Halaster brought with him seven apprentices to Mount Waterdeep.": "一千多年前，巫师{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM}（见{@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}）从遥远的地方来到沃特德普山脚下，也许是接受了天意的低声召唤。有人认为他来自几乎被遗忘的帝国，即摇篮地带。在过去的岁月里，人类从摇篮地蔓延到法鲁恩，起源于现在的紫尘平原，那是一片因与诸神冲突而产生的荒地。也有人认为哈拉斯特的起源不那么古老，将他置于尼瑟尔的早期巫师之中，或者断言他来自一个早已被沙子和时间掩埋的南方国家。无论他的出身如何，学者们都记录了哈拉斯特带着他的七个学徒来到沃特德普山。",
	"With the Seven guarding his back, Halaster tapped into his immense power to summon beings from other planes of existence to help him build a wizard's tower to dwarf all other wizard's towers. But as the seasons wore on, the Seven saw less and less of their enigmatic master. Halaster continued to use fell creatures from distant planes for tunneling and other construction beneath his tower, and the wizard kept the nature of most of his underground dealings a secret from the Seven. Eventually, Halaster's exploration broke into the Underhalls, a complex of tunnels and rooms built by the dwarves around a mithral mine beneath Mount Waterdeep. The architects of the Underhalls, the Melairkyn clan, had long ago been killed or dispersed, and warring duergar and drow had settled in the ruins. Halaster began a crusade against both the drow and the duergar, participating in wild hunts with extraplanar allies through the tunnels. The stubborn duergar dug in until the mithral was largely mined out; then they abandoned the Underhalls, leaving the drow to fight Halaster and his minions alone. The Mad Mage rounded up the remaining dark elves, trapping some of their souls for use in his dark magic, while twisting the bodies and enslaving the minds of others. Once he had wrung the drow of their usefulness, {@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} tunneled on, ever downward, indulging his inexplicable compulsion for delving deeper and deeper into the mountain.": "在七人组的保护下，哈拉斯特利用他巨大的力量，从其他存在的星球上召唤生命，帮助他建造一座巫师塔，使所有其他巫师塔相形见绌。但随着季节的推移，七人组越来越少地看到他们神秘的主人。哈拉斯特继续利用来自遥远星球的堕落生物在他的塔下开凿隧道和进行其他建设，而且这位巫师对他的大部分地下交易的性质都对七人保密。最终，哈拉斯特的探索闯入了地下大厅，这是一个由矮人在沃特迪普山下的密特拉矿周围建造的隧道和房间群。地下城的设计者--梅莱尔金（Melairkyn）氏族，很早以前就被杀死或驱散了，交战的杜尔加人和乌鸦在废墟中定居。哈拉斯特开始了对乌鸦和duergar的讨伐，与星外盟友一起参与了穿越隧道的疯狂狩猎。顽固的杜尔加人一直挖到米塔尔石被基本开采出来；然后他们放弃了地下大厅，留下乌鸦独自与哈拉斯特和他的爪牙战斗。疯法师围捕了剩余的黑暗精灵，将他们中的一些灵魂困在他的黑暗魔法中，同时扭曲了其他人的身体，奴役了他们的思想。一旦他榨干了乌鸦的用处，{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM}就继续挖隧道，一直往下挖，沉浸在他那莫名其妙的强迫症中，越挖越深的山。",
	"Using his underground complex as a base of operations, Halaster traveled to other planes and distant lands, collecting strange and dangerous creatures to live as prisoners, servants, or guardians in Undermountain. Populating and defending the dungeon became an obsession. Over time, the mage's preoccupation with Undermountain electrified his eccentricities and infused him with an air of unconcealable madness.": "哈拉斯特利用他的地下建筑群作为行动基地，前往其他星球和遥远的地方，收集奇怪和危险的生物，作为囚犯、仆人或地下山的守护者生活。填充和保卫地牢成为一种痴迷。随着时间的推移，法师对地下山的专注使他的怪癖变得更加强烈，并给他注入了一种难以掩饰的疯狂气息。",
	"Halaster's apprentices came and went. Some left only to return—inexplicably drawn down into Undermountain's depths. Others remained by his side. As they began dedicating more attention to their private obsessions, madness settled into their souls as well.": "哈拉斯特的学徒们来了又走。有些人离开后又回来了--莫名其妙地被卷入地下山的深处。其他人则留在了他身边。当他们开始将更多的注意力投入到他们的私人痴迷中时，疯狂也进入了他们的灵魂。",
	"During the years Halaster quested on other planes and sequestered himself in his tunnels, his magnificent tower and its surrounding walls fell into ruin. In time, the city now known as Waterdeep developed in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep and spread down to the harbor. As the city sprawled outward over the years, it came to surround the ruins of Halaster's home. Undermountain was known to those early settlers, and they often sent criminals into its endless depths as punishment. So it was for many years, until an intrepid adventurer named Durnan delved into the labyrinth beneath the tower and returned alive, laden with riches and countless harrowing tales. Durnan used his new fortune to demolish the remnants of Halaster's tower and built an inn over the well he had used to descend into Undermountain, and call it the Yawning Portal. Durnan owns and operates the inn and tavern to this day, serving patrons and inviting the brave and foolish alike to test their mettle in the Dungeon of the Mad Mage.": "在哈拉斯特在其他星球上探险和把自己关在隧道里的这些年里，他那座宏伟的塔和周围的墙壁都变成了废墟。随着时间的推移，现在被称为沃特德普的城市在沃特德普山的阴影下发展起来，并延伸到港口。随着城市多年来向外扩张，它开始围绕着哈拉斯特的家园废墟。早期的定居者们都知道山下，他们经常把罪犯送入无尽的深渊作为惩罚。就这样过了很多年，直到一个叫杜南的无畏的冒险家深入塔下的迷宫，并活着回来，带着财富和无数令人痛苦的故事。杜南用他的新财富拆除了哈拉斯特塔的残骸，并在他下到地下山的那口井上建造了一家旅馆，并将其称为 \"打哈欠的门户\"。杜南至今拥有并经营着这家客栈和酒馆，为顾客提供服务，并邀请勇敢的人和愚蠢的人在疯狂法师的地下城中测试他们的能力。",
	"Where Waterdeep stands today, there once stood Aelinthaldaar, the capital city of the ancient elven kingdom of Illefarn. When the elves left, they used a powerful spell to erase all traces of their capital. This spell had the unintended side effect of creating a permanent knot in the Weave, the fabric through which all magic is channeled. This knot lies deep underground and isn't something that can be seen, felt, or undone, but it can cause madness to bloom in the minds of mortal beings who dwell near it for too long. The knot permeates Undermountain, and the madness it causes typically manifests as an obsession with the dungeon itself. Those affected by the knot in the Weave exhibit a subconscious desire to remain in or near the dungeon. Halaster and several of his apprentices fell prey to this obsession, as did many Melairkyn dwarves and Durnan, the proprietor of the Yawning Portal. Not all creatures that dwell in Undermountain succumb to its madness, and those who do aren't even aware that the dungeon has them in its clutches.": "在Waterdeep今天矗立的地方，曾经有Aelinthaldaar，古代精灵王国Illefarn的首都。当精灵们离开时，他们用一个强大的咒语抹去了他们首都的所有痕迹。这个咒语有一个意外的副作用，那就是在 \"编织 \"中创造了一个永久的结，所有的魔法都是通过这个结传导的。这个结位于地下深处，不是可以看到、感觉到或解开的东西，但它会导致在它附近居住太久的凡人的头脑中绽放出疯狂。这个结渗透到地下山，它所导致的疯狂通常表现为对地牢本身的迷恋。那些受编织之结影响的人，会在潜意识中表现出对留在地牢或靠近地牢的渴望。哈拉斯特和他的几个学徒都是这种痴迷的牺牲品，许多梅莱尔金矮人和打哈欠门户的主人杜南也是如此。并非所有居住在阴山的生物都会屈服于它的疯狂，而那些屈服于它的生物甚至不知道地牢已经把他们抓在手里。",
	"The Yawning Portal, a famous inn and tavern located near the eastern slope of Mount Waterdeep, derives its name from a 40-foot-diameter well that descends into the first level of Undermountain. Located in the center of the taproom, the well was once the outer shell of Halaster's mighty tower, which was demolished long ago. Its sheer walls are made of old mortared stones. Next to this gaping orifice hangs a winch with a simple rope-and-pulley mechanism that Durnan, the proprietor, uses to lower adventurers down the shaft and (sometimes) pull them up again. Durnan controls the winch himself and will transport only one adventurer at a time. The trip takes 10 rounds, down and up. The rope is stained with old blood and long enough to reach all the way to the floor of the dark room at the bottom of the 140-foot shaft ({@area level 1, area 1|035|x}).": "打哈欠的门，是位于沃特德普山东坡附近的一家著名的客栈和酒馆，其名字来自于一口直径40英尺的井，这口井下到了地下山的第一层。这口井位于酒馆的中央，曾经是哈拉斯特强大的塔楼的外壳，很久以前就被拆除了。它的峭壁是由古老的石块砌成的。在这个缺口的旁边，挂着一个绞盘，上面有一个简单的绳索和滑轮装置，老板杜南用它把冒险者从井里放下去，（有时）再把他们拉上来。杜南亲自控制绞盘，每次只运送一个冒险者。这趟旅程需要10个回合，向下和向上。绳子沾满了旧血，足够长，可以一直伸到140英尺井底的黑暗房间的地板上（{@area level 1, area 1|035|x}）。",
	"Durnan charges adventurers 1 gp each to descend into the well, whether they opt to use the rope or not. The return trip also costs a piece of gold, sent up in a bucket in advance. He also readily accepts coin from patrons who want to place grisly bets on adventurers who dare explore Undermountain, and their odds of returning alive. \"Five gold dragons says they're back before a tenday, minus the fighter, the wizard, and the cleric!\" is the flavor of commentary often heard amid gales of drunken laughter.": "无论冒险者是否选择使用绳索，杜南都会收取每人1金币的下井费。回程的费用也是一块金子，事先放在桶里送上去。他也很乐意接受那些想在敢于探索地下山的冒险者身上下赌注的顾客的钱币，以及他们活着回来的几率。\"五条金龙说他们会在一个工作日之前回来，其中不包括战士、巫师和牧师！\"这是在醉醺醺的笑声中经常听到的评论的味道。",
	"The walls of the well are crumbly but have abundant handholds and footholds. They can be scaled without climbing gear with a successful DC 15 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. No check is needed to enter Undermountain by using the rope-and-pulley system.": "井壁很脆弱，但有丰富的手掌和脚掌。只要成功地进行DC15力量({@skill Athletics})检查，就可以在没有攀登装备的情况下攀登。使用绳索和滑轮系统进入山下时不需要检查。",
	"Adventurers who hang around the Yawning Portal often find work delving into Undermountain on the errands of others. The characters might have their own reasons for venturing into the Mad Mage's dungeon, but the adventure hooks described in this section can be used as further motivation. These hooks are divided into two categories: starting quests and future quests. Adventurers are under no obligation to accept or complete any of these quests, though the promised rewards are often substantial enough to be tempting.": "在打哈欠门附近游荡的冒险者经常会因为别人的差事而找到深入山下的工作。角色们可能有自己的理由进入疯狂法师的地牢，但本节所述的冒险钩子可以作为进一步的动机。这些钩子分为两类：起始任务和未来任务。冒险者没有义务接受或完成任何这些任务，尽管承诺的奖励往往足够诱人。",
	"Starting quests are available to characters from the outset of their experience with Undermountain.

Joroth believes Falkir is dead (divination spells have confirmed as much) but would like to see the gemstone returned to its proper owners to strengthen political ties between Waterdeep and Mirabar.": "乔罗斯穿着便装走近人物，要求他们留意法尔基尔之拳，这是一个由四个矮人冒险者组成的队伍，一年多前在地下山失踪了。这支队伍的首领法尔基尔-格雷夫里斯特（Falkir Gravelfist）被认为在失踪前几周从水底世界的米拉巴兰大使馆偷了一块著名的绿宝石--蜘蛛之眼。乔罗斯相信法尔基尔已经死了（占卜法术已经证实了这一点），但他希望看到宝石物归原主，以加强沃特德普和米拉巴的政治联系。",
	"Characters who belong to the Lords' Alliance gain 3 renown (see \"{@book Renown|DMG|1|Renown}\" in chapter 1 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}) for returning the Eye of the Spider to Joroth.

	"Unbeknownst to anyone but her closest confidants, Laeral's magic has begun to wane. She has researched a way to halt the decline, at least temporarily, but she needs a fragment of a magic crystal called the Runestone. The crystal was created by {@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} and secreted away in the depths of Undermountain. Laeral has sent Jalester to hire a band of adventurers to retrieve a pebble-sized fragment of the Runestone, which he can then deliver to Laeral in utmost secrecy.": "除了她最亲密的知己之外，任何人都不知道，Laeral的魔法已经开始减弱。她已经研究出一种方法来阻止这种衰退，至少是暂时的，但她需要一块叫做 \"符文石 \"的魔法水晶碎片。这块水晶是由{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM}创造的，并被秘密藏在地下山的深处。拉拉尔已经派杰莱斯特雇佣了一队冒险者去取回一块鹅卵石大小的符文石碎片，然后他可以极其隐秘地将其交给拉拉尔。",
	"Jalester tells the characters that he wants the fragment for himself and won't disclose its purpose, except to say that its recovery will help to ensure Waterdeep's security (a true statement). He describes the Runestone as a large, glowing, disk-shaped gem with Halaster's rune floating in it.": "杰雷斯特告诉角色们，他想把碎片据为己有，而且不会透露它的用途，只是说它的恢复将有助于确保水底世界的安全（这是一个真实的说法）。他将符文石描述为一个巨大的、发光的、盘状的宝石，里面漂浮着哈拉斯特的符文。",

Helion is Wylynd's heir apparent, and this mission is as much a test for him as it is for the adventurers.": "水底城月星贵族家族的族长怀恩德-月星女士得到消息，说有一队冒险者最近在暗山取得了一些成功。她尽可能地了解了这些冒险者的情况，然后派她的外甥，一个叫赫利昂-月星的有礼貌的半乌鸦去见他们。海利安是怀恩德的继承人，这次任务对他和冒险者来说都是一个考验。",
	"Lady Wylynd believes it's her family's responsibility to free the dragon from Shar's evil grasp one way or another. She asks Helion to meet with the adventurers and convince them to find the shadow dragon in Vanrakdoom, one of the deeper levels of Undermountain, and break Shar's hold over him. Failing that, they should put the dragon out of his misery. In exchange for their help, Helion promises the friendship of House Moonstar, which comes with tangible benefits:": "怀林德夫人认为，她的家族有责任以某种方式将龙从夏尔的邪恶控制中解救出来。她要求赫利安与冒险者们见面，说服他们在地下山的一个更深的层次--凡拉克多姆（Vanrakdoom）找到影龙，并打破沙尔对它的控制。如果做不到这一点，他们应该让这只龙脱离苦海。作为对他们帮助的交换，赫利昂承诺给予月星家族的友谊，这将带来切实的好处。",

	"An ulitharid (see {@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}) has been using telepathy to contact random people in the city and learn all it can about Waterdeep. Those the creature has contacted know nothing of the ulitharid's true nature, only that an alien intellect has reached out to them for information. Word of these telepathic intrusions has begun to spread throughout the city, gaining traction as more than just a mad rumor. Several of Durnan's regular patrons have spoken at length about it, and Durnan believes the source might be somewhere in Undermountain. In fact, he thinks a horrific, psionic monster called an elder brain might be lurking in the dungeon. Not wanting to alarm anyone with rumors of mind flayers, he keeps this conjecture to himself for now.": "一个Ulitharid（见{@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}）一直在使用心灵感应来联系城市中的随机人群，并了解关于Waterdeep的一切。那些被联系到的人对乌利塔里德的真面目一无所知，只知道有一个外星智囊在向他们寻求信息。这些心灵感应入侵的消息已经开始在整个城市传播，不仅仅是一个疯狂的谣言，而是越来越多。杜南的几位老主顾已经详细谈论了这个问题，杜南认为源头可能在暗山的某个地方。事实上，他认为地下城中可能潜伏着一种叫做 \"长者之脑 \"的可怕的幻觉怪物。他不想用关于心灵絮乱者的传言来惊动任何人，所以暂时把这个猜想留给自己。",

	"Among the greatest of Undermountain's secrets is the story of Jhesiyra Kestellharp, who was one of Halaster's most gifted apprentices until it became clear to her that Halaster was irrevocably insane. She fled, but Halaster dragged her back to Undermountain and trapped her in the Citadel of the Bloody Hand, a dungeon complex under Mount Waterdeep connected to Undermountain. Jhesiyra escaped her prison when its wards failed during the Spellplague. To hide from Halaster, she magically confined herself in the stones of Undermountain. She now exists in a bodiless state, inhabiting the very dungeon itself. Halaster is unaware of Jhesiyra's presence but also wonders over her disappearance following the Spellplague.": "地下城最伟大的秘密之一是杰西拉-凯斯泰尔哈普（Jhesiyra Kestellharp）的故事。她是哈拉斯特最有天赋的学徒之一，直到她清楚地知道哈拉斯特已经不可逆转地疯了。她逃走了，但哈拉斯特把她拖回了地下山，并把她困在了血手堡垒，这是水底山下与地下山相连的一个地牢建筑。在法术瘟疫期间，当监狱的防护装置失效时，杰西拉逃出了监狱。为了躲避哈拉斯特，她用魔法将自己限制在地下山的石头里。她现在以无躯体的状态存在，居住在地牢本身。哈拉斯特不知道杰西拉的存在，但也对她在法术之灾后的失踪感到疑惑。",
	"Jhesiyra's plan is to use adventurers to defeat Halaster so that she can seize control of Undermountain. To that end, she does everything in her power to keep adventurers in Undermountain alive. Her abilities are, however, limited in her current, bodiless form.": "杰西拉的计划是利用冒险者来打败哈拉斯特，这样她就可以夺取地下山的控制权。为了达到这个目的，她不惜一切代价让地下城的冒险者活着。然而，她的能力在她目前的无躯体状态下是有限的。",
	"Jhesiyra can exert control over Halaster's magic gates, keeping adventurers from passing through them if she thinks they lack the might needed to defeat the perils beyond. In terms of game rules, characters are prevented from passing through a gate when their experience level fails to meet a prerequisite (the recommended character level for which the dungeon level is designed). Any character who doesn't qualify is pushed back without being harmed when trying to step through the open gate. Only a {@spell wish} spell can allow a character to pass through. As the Dungeon Master, you can suspend this restriction and allow characters who don't meet the level prerequisite to pass through a gate, particularly if you think they have the resources to survive and overcome that dangers that await them.": "Jhesiyra可以对Halaster的魔法门进行控制，如果她认为冒险者缺乏击败门外危险所需的力量，就不让他们通过。就游戏规则而言，当角色的经验值不符合先决条件（地牢等级设计时推荐的角色等级）时，他们就无法通过大门。任何不符合条件的角色在试图跨过打开的大门时都会被推后而不受到伤害。只有{@spell wish}的法术才能让角色通过。作为地下城主，你可以暂停这一限制，允许不符合等级先决条件的角色通过大门，特别是如果你认为他们有足够的资源来生存并克服等待他们的危险。",
	"Jhesiyra can't stop characters from moving between dungeon levels by more conventional means. Whenever they enter a dungeon level designed for characters of a higher experience level, Jhesiyra sends them the following telepathic warning in Common: \"Turn back! You're not prepared for the danger that lies ahead!\" Characters are free to ignore her warning. She can't and won't elaborate on the nature of the danger that awaits the adventurers or communicate with them in any other way, for fear of being detected by Halaster.": "Jhesiyra无法阻止角色通过更常规的方式在地牢关卡之间移动。每当他们进入一个为更高经验等级的角色设计的地牢关卡时，Jhesiyra就会用普通话向他们发出以下心灵感应的警告：\"回头！你还没有准备好应对前面的危险！你还没有准备好应对前方的危险！\" 角色可以自由地忽略她的警告。她不能也不会详细说明等待冒险者的危险的性质，也不会以任何其他方式与他们交流，因为害怕被哈拉斯特发现。",
	"Powerful divination magic can reveal Jhesiyra's disembodied presence throughout Undermountain. But not even a {@spell wish} spell or divine intervention will allow direct, two-way communication with Halaster's former apprentice.": "强大的占卜魔法可以显示出杰西拉在整个地下山的失魂状态。但即使是{@spell wish}的法术或神的干预，也无法与哈拉斯特的前学徒进行直接、双向的交流。",
	"For the sake of avoiding repetitive descriptions, common features of Undermountain are summarized here.": "为了避免重复描述，这里总结了Undermountain的共同特征。",
	"Halaster doesn't make it easy for creatures to enter or leave his dungeon. No spell other than {@spell wish} can be used to enter Undermountain, leave it, or transport oneself from one level to another. {@spell Astral projection}, {@spell teleport}, {@spell plane shift}, {@spell word of recall}, and similar spells cast for these reasons simply fail, as do effects that banish a creature to another plane of existence. These restrictions apply to magic items and artifacts that have properties that transport or banish creatures to other planes as well. Magic that allows transit to the Border Ethereal, such as the {@spell etherealness} spell, is the exception to this rule. A creature that enters the Border Ethereal from Undermountain is pulled back into the dungeon upon leaving that plane.": "哈拉斯特并没有让生物轻易进入或离开他的地牢。除了{@spell wish}以外，其他的法术都不能用来进入地下城，离开它，或者把自己从一层传送到另一层。{@spell Astral projection}, {@spell teleport}, {@spell plane shift}, {@spell word of recall}, 和类似的法术，因为这些原因而施放的法术都会失败，就像把生物放逐到另一个存在平面的效果一样。这些限制也适用于具有传送或放逐生物到其他位面的属性的魔法物品和神器。允许传送到边界虚空的魔法，例如{@spell etherealness}咒语，是这个规则的例外。从山下进入边境虚空的生物在离开该位面时将被拉回地牢。",
	"Magic that summons creatures or objects from other planes functions normally in Undermountain, as does magic that involves an extradimensional space. Any spells cast within such an extradimensional space (such as that created by a {@spell Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion} spell) are subject to the same restrictions as magic cast in Undermountain.": "召唤其他位面的生物或物体的魔法在冥界正常运作，涉及到超维空间的魔法也一样。任何在这样的次元空间内施展的魔法（例如由{@spell Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion}法术创造的空间），都会受到与在冥界施展的魔法相同的限制。",
	"Spells can't destroy or alter the shape of Undermountain's magically protected ceilings, pillars, columns, walls, or floors. For example, an {@spell earthquake} spell would not trigger a ceiling collapse or create fissures in Undermountain. Doors and furnishings, however, are not protected in this way.": "法术不能破坏或改变Undermountain的受魔法保护的天花板、支柱、柱子、墙壁或地板的形状。例如，一个{@spell earthquake}的法术不会引发天花板坍塌，也不会在Undermountain产生裂缝。然而，门和家具则不会受到这种保护。",
	"While they are in Undermountain, characters who receive spells from deities or otherworldly patrons continue to do so. In addition, spells that allow contact with beings from other planes function normally.": "当他们在冥山时，从神灵或其他世界的赞助人那里接受法术的角色继续这样做。此外，允许与其他位面的生命接触的法术也正常运作。",
	"Inside Undermountain, Halaster can't be contacted by means of {@spell sending} spells. Any creature that tries to contact him with a {@spell sending} spell is magically redirected to the Mad Mage's nothic secretary (see {@area level 9, area 31|51d|x}). Each time it is contacted in this manner, the nothic replies with a string of expletives in Undercommon. Other things the nothic might say (in Undercommon) include the following:": "在山下，Halaster不能通过{@spell sending}的法术来联系。任何试图用{@spell sending}法术联系他的生物都会被神奇地转到疯狂法师的nothic秘书那里（见{@area level 9, area 31|51d|x}）。每次以这种方式联系他时，nothic都会用一连串的暗语来回答。Nothic可能会说的其他事情（用Undercommon语）包括如下。",

	"\"Halaster's not home right now.\"": "\"哈拉斯特现在不在家。\"",
	"Halaster wants adventurers to clear out parts of his dungeon so that he can restock the tunnels with new threats from across the planes. He's unhappy about the amount of space the drow take up on levels 3, 10, and 12. He's also concerned that the conflict between the githyanki on level 16 and the mind flayers on level 17 could spiral out of control; consequently, he wants one side or the other (or both) eliminated.": "哈拉斯特希望冒险者清理他的地牢的部分区域，这样他就可以用来自各星球的新威胁来重新填充隧道。他对乌鸦在3、10和12层所占的空间感到不满。他还担心第16层的吉特安基人和第17层的心灵传播者之间的冲突会失去控制；因此，他希望一方或另一方（或两者）被消灭。",
	"An irksome lich named {@creature Ezzat|WDMM} has taken refuge on level 20, and Halaster wants adventurers to destroy the lich and its phylactery. Halaster has bound two genies (a dao and a marid) to level 19 and uses them to help adventurers accomplish this goal.": "一个名叫{@creature Ezzat|WDMM}的令人讨厌的巫师在第20层避难，Halaster希望冒险者们能消灭这个巫师和它的法器。哈拉斯特将两个精灵（一个道和一个马利德）绑定到19级，用它们来帮助冒险者完成这个目标。",
	"Halaster wants fewer adventurers coming down the well to pester him and steal his valuable belongings. To that end, his goal is to terrify adventurers and send them screaming back to Waterdeep with horror stories that discourage others from descending into Undermountain.": "哈拉斯特希望能有更多的冒险者下到井里来纠缠他，偷取他宝贵的物品。为此，他的目标是吓唬冒险者，让他们带着恐怖的故事尖叫着回到水底世界，从而阻止其他人进入地下山。",
	"The Shadowdusks were Waterdavian nobles who descended into madness, taking refuge in Undermountain. Halaster wants to return them to power in the city above and use them as puppets to rule Waterdeep from below as its Shadow Lord. Adventurers can thwart Halaster's scheme by destroying the leaders of the Shadowdusk family and laying waste to their stronghold on level 22.": "Shadowdusks是Waterdavian的贵族，他们陷入疯狂，在Undermountain避难。哈拉斯特想让他们回到上面的城市中掌权，并把他们当作傀儡，作为影子领主从下面统治水底世界。冒险家们可以通过摧毁影子黄昏家族的首领，破坏他们在第22层的据点来挫败哈拉斯特的计划。",
	"Halaster is searching for one or more new apprentices worthy of his time and tutelage. He is cultivating talent on level 9, but he's also paying close attention to other arcane spellcasters who enter Undermountain. Of course, once the novelty of new apprentices wears off, Halaster will likely do the same thing he's done with all his previous apprentices: teach them ways to mutilate and destroy themselves.": "哈拉斯特正在寻找一个或多个值得他花时间辅导的新学徒。他正在培养第9级的人才，但他也在密切关注其他进入地下山的奥术施法者。当然，一旦新学徒的新鲜感消失，哈拉斯特很可能会像对待他以前所有的学徒一样：教他们如何残害和毁灭自己。",
	"Somewhere in the back of his twisted, paranoid mind, Halaster believes that Jhesiyra Kestellharp is still alive and plotting to destroy him. He has no clue where Jhesiyra might be, but he can't rest until the mystery of her disappearance is solved and she's his prisoner once again. Halaster thinks he can use the adventurers to lure Jhesiyra out of hiding, but they turn out to be the same adventurers she's using to find and destroy him.": "在他扭曲、偏执的脑海中，哈拉斯特认为杰西拉-凯斯泰尔哈普仍然活着，并且在策划着要摧毁他。他不知道杰西拉可能在哪里，但他不能休息，直到她失踪的谜团被解开，她再次成为他的俘虏。哈拉斯特认为他可以利用冒险者来引诱杰西拉出来，但他们原来也是她用来寻找和摧毁他的冒险者。",
	"Undermountain is made up of a mixture of smooth, worked stone and rough-hewn stone, with the occasional intruding natural tunnel or cavern. A few levels have exceptional architectural features; for example, level 16, the Crystal Labyrinth, has walls, floors, and ceilings made of crystal.": "山下由光滑的加工过的石头和粗凿的石头混合而成，偶尔会有天然隧道或洞穴侵入。有几层具有特殊的建筑特征；例如，第16层，水晶迷宫，其墙壁、地板和天花板都是由水晶制成的。",

	"Elder runes are ancient symbols imbued with magical power. With years of study, any creature that can cast the {@spell symbol} spell can learn an elder rune and add it to the selection of symbols that can be created with the spell.

	"An elder rune has two possible effects: one beneficial (called the boon effect) and the other harmful (called the bane effect). The elder rune's creator chooses which effect occurs or can randomize it so that a die is rolled to determine whether the bane effect (odd die roll) or the boon effect (even die roll) is triggered.": "一个长老符文有两种可能的效果：一种是有益的（称为繁荣效应），另一种是有害的（称为祸害效应）。长老符文的创造者可以选择发生哪种效果，也可以将其随机化，这样就可以通过掷骰子来决定触发的是祸害效果（奇数骰子）还是福佑效果（偶数骰子）。",

	"Halaster creates magic gates that allow instant travel between levels of the dungeon. He can also create gates that lead into and out of Undermountain, which he uses primarily to restock the dungeon with monsters.

These gates are not subject to the restrictions outlined in the \"Alterations to Magic\" section.": "哈拉斯特创造了魔法门，可以在地牢各层之间即时旅行。他还可以创造出通往地下山的大门，他主要用这些大门来补充地牢里的怪物。他的旧门被法术瘟疫摧毁了，但哈拉斯特用新的门取代了它们，其中大部分的目的地都被限制在地牢里。这些门不受 \"魔法的改变 \"一节中的限制。",

All the gates leading to and from level 10 are mirror gates.": "{@b Mirror Gate}. 此门由一面壁挂式镜子组成，卵形或长方形，包裹在雕刻的石框中。镜子有10英尺高，5英尺宽，除非另有说明。所有进出10层的门都是镜子门。",
	"{@b Standing Gate}. This gate forms between two standing stones or pillars. Unless otherwise noted, these columns are 15 feet tall and spaced 10 feet apart, with a stone lintel resting horizontally atop them to form a rectangular opening. Because the gate is freestanding, one can pass through it from either direction.": "{@b Standing Gate}. 这个门在两块立石或柱子之间形成。除非另有说明，这些柱子有15英尺高，间隔10英尺，上面有一个石质门楣水平放置，形成一个矩形的开口。由于大门是独立的，人们可以从任何方向通过。",
	"When a gate opens, a random elder rune appears within its vertical plane. Draw a card from the Elder Runes Deck to determine which rune appears. Halaster usually has the rune target the first creature that passes through the open gate. Every so often, to keep the players guessing, you can have the rune trigger when the second or third creature passes through. Once an elder rune is triggered, it vanishes until Halaster recasts the {@spell symbol} spell on the gate.": "当一扇门打开时，一个随机的长老符文会出现在其垂直面内。从长老符文牌中抽一张牌来决定哪个符文出现。哈拉斯特通常会让符文针对第一个通过开放大门的生物。每隔一段时间，为了让玩家猜测，你可以让符文在第二个或第三个生物通过时触发。一旦长老符文被触发，它就会消失，直到Halaster在门上重新施放{@spell symbol}的咒语。",
	"Since the creatures that originally carved out Undermountain had {@sense darkvision} and Halaster lights his way by using magic, areas of the dungeon are unlit unless otherwise noted.": "由于最初雕刻出地下山的生物有{@sense darkvision}，而且哈拉斯特通过使用魔法来照亮他的路，除非另有说明，否则地下城的区域是没有灯光的。",
	"If your party of adventurers is {@condition incapacitated} or killed in Undermountain, you have an unusual option for keeping both them and the campaign alive: the characters could awaken in an alternate version of the Yawning Portal that is part of a psionically generated simulation of Waterdeep called Alterdeep, created by the ulitharid on level 17. If you choose this option, the characters are stabilized, brought to level 17 of the dungeon by mind flayers or their thralls, and placed in capsules called psipods. While {@condition unconscious} and trapped in these psipods, the characters are immersed in the ulitharid's realistic simulation of Waterdeep. Over time, they'll notice inconsistencies that suggest they're not where they appear to be, and they'll have chances to converse with the ulitharid in its many guises and convince it to set them free. For more information on Alterdeep and its ulitharid creator, see {@adventure level 17|WDMM|17}.": "如果你的冒险者队伍在山下被{@condition incapacitated}或被杀，你有一个不寻常的选择来保持他们和活动的生命力：角色可以在另一个版本的打哈欠传送门中醒来，这个传送门是由Ulitharid在第17层创造的Waterdeep的幻觉模拟的一部分，叫做Alterdeep。如果你选择了这个选项，角色就会被稳定下来，被思想絮乱者或他们的侍从带到地下城的第17层，并被置于称为psipods的胶囊中。当{@condition unconscious}和被困在这些psipods中时，人物会沉浸在ulitharid对Waterdeep的逼真模拟中。随着时间的推移，他们会注意到一些不一致的地方，这些不一致的地方表明他们并不在他们所出现的地方，他们会有机会与ulitharid的各种身份进行交流，并说服它让他们获得自由。关于Alterdeep和它的ulitharid创造者的更多信息，见{@adventure level 17|WDMM|17}。",

	"The Undertakers are aware that bugbears and goblins are spying on them (see \"Xanathar Guild\" below).

The other two are fighting over a rusty shield embossed with a symbol resembling a stylized goblin skull.": "其中一个虫人正在翻找收集的矮人晨星，并将不受欢迎的晨星扔到地上。另外两个正在争夺一面生锈的盾牌，上面压印着一个类似于地精头骨的符号。",
	"The room contains dozens of suits of plate armor, scale armor, and chain mail, as well as scores of shields, battleaxes, morningstars, warhammers, war picks, and javelins. Most of these items have deteriorated to the point of being useless and irreparable. Rust has eaten away the metal, and dampness has rotted the leather straps and bindings on the shields and armor.": "房间里有几十套板甲、鳞甲和链甲，以及几十个盾牌、战斧、晨星、战锤、战镐和标枪。这些物品中的大多数都已经退化到了无用和不可修复的地步。锈蚀了金属，潮湿使盾牌和盔甲上的皮革带子和捆绑物腐烂了。",

	"The ballistae can't perceive (and thus they ignore) creatures that keep to the easternmost 60-foot section of the hallway. Once they detect intruders, however, the ballistae amble forward on hinged legs to close the distance. If a ballista has nothing to attack on its turn, it returns to its starting position.": "抛石机无法感知（因此它们忽略了）那些保持在走廊最东边60英尺部分的生物。然而，一旦探测到入侵者，弹弓手就会用铰链腿向前移动，拉近距离。如果一个弹弓手在它的回合中没有什么可攻击的，它就会返回到它的起始位置。",

A copper spigot is embedded in the vats on the side facing the nearest wall, at a height of 3 feet. A narrow stone staircase curls up the exterior of each vat to the top, which is fitted with a hinged copper lid.

	"When a creature weighing 50 pounds or more steps on a pit's cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the creature to spill into the pit below and take {@dice 2d6} bludgeoning damage from the fall. The lid is spring-loaded and snaps closed after the creature falls through. A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the lid open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see in the dark.": "当体重在50磅以上的生物踩到坑的盖子时，它就会像陷阱门一样旋转打开，导致生物溢出到下面的坑中，并受到{@dice 2d6}坠落的打击伤害。盖子是弹簧式的，在生物落下后会扣上。撬开盖子需要成功的DC20力量检查。在坑中的人物也可以尝试从内部禁用弹簧装置，只要能接触到装置并且在黑暗中能看到，就可以使用盗贼的工具，成功地进行DC15灵巧检查。",
	"Wedging at least two iron spikes between the pit's lid and the surrounding floor prevents the lid from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The lid can also be magically held shut with an {@spell arcane lock} spell or similar magic. The dwarves constructed the pit covers so that they won't open if an object is rolled over them. A character can circumvent the traps by climbing into an empty barrel and rolling down the hall or climbing onto a barrel and balancing atop it as it rolls down the hall. Balancing atop a barrel as it careens down the hall requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check.": "在坑的盖子和周围的地板之间楔入至少两根铁钉，可以防止盖子打开，从而使其可以安全穿越。坑盖也可以用{@spell arcane lock}的咒语或类似的魔法神奇地关闭。矮人建造的坑盖，如果有物体滚过它们，它们就不会打开。一个角色可以通过爬进一个空的木桶并滚下大厅，或者爬上木桶并在它滚下大厅时在上面保持平衡来绕过这些陷阱。当木桶滚下大厅时，在木桶上保持平衡需要成功地进行DC20的灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）检查。",

	"The room's walls climb 10 feet, then angle inward to form a pyramidal cap with a 30-foot-high apex. Stacked in the middle of the room are one hundred forty zurkhwood barrels banded in iron. The barrels form a 21-foot-high pyramid with a base measuring seven barrels on a side. Engraved on the lid of each barrel is a magical glyph that radiates an aura of abjuration magic under the scrutiny of a {@spell detect magic} spell.": "房间的墙壁爬升了10英尺，然后向内倾斜，形成一个金字塔形的帽子，顶点有30英尺高。房间中间堆放着一百四十个用铁条捆绑的祖尔哈木桶。这些木桶形成了一个21英尺高的金字塔，底面有7个木桶的边。每个桶的盖子上都刻着一个神奇的石刻，在{@spell detect magic}法术的监视下，它能放射出一种禁忌魔法的光环。",
	"Each barrel contains 40 gallons of dwarven ale that has been magically preserved for centuries. Removing a barrel's lid or breaking the barrel causes its glyph to fade away, ending the preservation spell on that barrel. If the ale is marketed as \"Melairkyn Ale,\" \"Undermountain Ale,\" or something similar, characters can sell a barrel of it for 40 gp in Waterdeep. A full barrel of ale weighs approximately 400 pounds.": "每个桶里有40加仑的矮人麦酒，已经被神奇地保存了几个世纪。揭开桶盖或打碎桶身会使它的字迹消失，从而结束对该桶的保存咒语。如果这种麦酒在市场上被称为 \"Melairkyn Ale\"、\"Undermountain Ale \"或类似的名字，角色可以在Waterdeep以40gp的价格出售一桶。一桶完整的麦酒大约有400磅重。",
	"This room is identical to {@area area 22e|16c|x}, except the pyramid of barrels has collapsed. Most of the barrels lie smashed on the floor. Fifty-nine of them remain intact, their ale preserved. Another three appear to be intact but are, in fact, three {@creature Mimic||mimics} placed here by Halaster. The three hide within 10 feet of one another and fight together.": "这个房间与{@area area 22e|16c|x}相同，只是桶的金字塔已经倒塌了。大部分的木桶都被砸在地上。其中59个仍然完好无损，它们的麦芽酒被保存下来。另外三个看起来完好无损，但实际上是哈拉斯特放在这里的三个（1%）。这三个人躲在彼此的10英尺之内，一起战斗。",
	"These rooms once formed a temple dedicated to the dwarven god Dumathoin, the Keeper of Secrets under the Mountain, but Halaster has destroyed and replaced most of their original contents.": "这些房间曾经构成了一座供奉矮人之神杜马托因的神庙，他是山下的秘密守护者，但哈拉斯特已经破坏并取代了它们的大部分原始内容。",
	"{@b Light}. The walls climb 15 feet, then angle inward to create a peaked, 30-foot-high ceiling. The sloped upper walls have red glowing crystals set into them. These crystals fill the hall with dim light. (Crystals pried out of their fixtures go dark.)": "{@b Light}. 墙壁爬升15英尺，然后向内倾斜，形成一个尖顶，30英尺高的天花板。倾斜的上墙有红色发光的水晶镶嵌其中。这些水晶让大厅充满了昏暗的光线。(被撬开的水晶会变暗。)",

The lower walls were once lined with carvings depicting dwarves pushing mine carts toward the west, but these works have been defaced and, in some cases, replaced with stony tentacles that protrude from the walls.": "{@b Carvings}. 下部的墙壁上曾经有雕刻，描绘了矮人将矿车推向西方，但这些作品已经被污损，在某些情况下，被从墙壁上伸出的石质触角所取代。",

Carved into the walls flanking the double door stand armored dwarves, their stony beards flowing out of great helms that conceal their facial features.": "{@b Dwarf-Guarded Doors}. 一扇20英尺高的双门关在大厅的西端。双层门两侧的墙壁上雕刻着装甲矮人，他们的石质胡须从巨大的头盔中流出，掩盖了他们的面部特征。",
	"Halaster used magic to distort the wall carvings almost beyond recognition and to create tentacle-like protrusions that weren't part of the original design. These tentacles writhe as creatures pass by them—a harmless effect created by the Mad Mage.": "哈拉斯特用魔法将墙上的雕刻扭曲得几乎无法辨认，并创造出触手状的突起，而这并不是原始设计的一部分。这些触手在生物经过时蠕动，这是疯狂法师创造的无害效果。",
	"{@b Ceiling}. The 30-foot-high vaulted ceiling of this room is supported every 20 feet or so by thick stone arches.": "{@b Ceiling}. 这个房间30英尺高的拱形天花板，每隔20英尺左右就有一个厚厚的石拱门支撑。",
	"{@b Skeletal Displays}. Standing in the hall are the skeletons of four Huge dragons, their bones held together by wire and cement. A few pieces of each dragon have broken off and fallen to the floor. A fifth dragon skeleton in a similar state of disrepair fills an alcove to the south.": "{@b Skeletal Displays}. 站在大厅里的是四条巨龙的骨架，它们的骨头被铁丝和水泥固定在一起。每条龙都有几块碎片断裂，掉落在地上。第五具龙的骨架也处于类似的失修状态，填满了南边的一个凹槽。",

The gold dragon skeleton occupies the southern alcove, while the others are lined up in the main hall.

	"Casting a {@spell speak with dead} spell on the skeleton reveals that the tiefling, Savir, was a monk who fell prey to a cloaker. Savir's spirit doesn't know what became of his adventuring companions or the cloaker. If questioned about Undermountain, Savir's spirit reveals that there's an elven tomb nearby with a secret door in the north wall that neither he nor his companions could open.

	"A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the pillars. Touching a pillar while speaking the proper command phrase (\"Elf magic!\") causes a pale light to fill the area between the four pillars, ending the following conditions on a creature in that area: {@condition blinded}, {@condition deafened}, {@condition petrified}, {@condition poisoned}, and {@condition stunned}. This magical effect can be activated four times, once for each pillar touched. The pillars regain their magic at the next dawn.": "一个{@spell detect magic}的咒语揭示了柱子周围的禁咒魔法的光环。触摸一个柱子，同时说出适当的命令短语（\"精灵魔法！\"），会使四根柱子之间的区域充满淡淡的光，结束该区域内生物的下列状况。{@condition blinded}, {@condition deafened}, {@condition petrified}, {@condition poisoned}, 和{@condition stunned}。这个魔法效果可以被激活四次，每触及一根柱子就激活一次。柱子在下一个黎明时分重新获得魔力。",

	"The quadrone speaks and understands the Modron language only. It knows that the caryatids can restore {@condition petrified} creatures to flesh, having seen them in action, and it has heard Halaster speak the command phrase to activate the caryatids.

It knows almost nothing about Undermountain and disintegrates if reduced to 0 hit points.": "四角龙只说并能听懂莫德隆语。它知道，在看到它们的行动后，阴阳师可以将生物恢复成肉体，而且它还听到哈拉斯特说出了激活阴阳师的命令句子。它的指令并不妨碍它与陌生人交流或与他们分享信息。它对暗山几乎一无所知，如果降低到0命中率就会瓦解。",
	"Stored here are creatures that have been turned to stone by Halaster, as summarized in the Petrified Creatures table. Each can be restored to flesh with a {@spell greater restoration} spell or similar magic. A restored creature acts in accordance with its nature.

The lid of the sarcophagus is carved in the likeness of a regal elf of indeterminate age and gender, with a yawning cat stretching on the elf's chest. The cat is part of the lid's carving, not a separate sculpture.": "在这个尘土飞扬的坟墓中间，有一个重达7500磅的雪花石膏石棺，放在一块1英尺高的花岗岩上。石棺的盖子上雕刻着一个年龄和性别不确定的高贵精灵的形象，一只打着哈欠的猫在精灵的胸前伸展。这只猫是棺盖雕刻的一部分，而不是一个单独的雕塑。",

	"A creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down by using an action to make a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere's speed is reduced by 15 feet. In the sloped hallway, this reduction lasts only until the end of the sphere's next turn. If the sphere's speed drops to 0 on a flat surface, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.": "在球体5英尺范围内的生物可以通过使用行动进行DC20力量检查来试图减缓它的速度。如果检定成功，球体的速度会降低15英尺。在倾斜的走廊里，这种减速只持续到球体的下一回合结束。如果球体的速度在平坦的表面下降到0，它就会停止移动，不再是一个威胁。",

	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} has conflicted feelings about Halaster. She is grateful to him for providing her a home and keeping Wyllowwood alive with his magic, but she blames him for Yinark's death. She also pities him, for the Mad Mage too appears to be trapped in a prison of his own making. {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} believes he is no longer human, but an immortal entity composed of pure magic. Thus, she has given up any hope of being rid of him.": "{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}对哈拉斯特的感情很矛盾。她很感激他为她提供了一个家，并以他的魔法使怀洛伍德得以生存，但她又为尹纳克的死责怪他。她也很同情他，因为这个疯狂的法师似乎也被困在了他自己制造的监狱里。{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}认为他不再是人类，而是一个由纯魔法组成的不朽实体。因此，她已经放弃了摆脱他的任何希望。",

It sleeps atop a platform overlooking the River of the Depths, guarding its treasure.": "这条年轻的绿龙曾经是一个合法的邪恶生物，当一个冒险者用一把有生命的、名为{@item sword of sharpness}的绿宝石刃的长剑刺穿它的头骨时，它的排列和性格发生了变化。这条龙现在称自己为 \"Tearulai\"，并拥有长剑的中性良好排列。它睡在俯瞰深渊之河的平台上，守护着它的宝藏。",
	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} once set adventurers against Valdemar, hoping to destroy the evil dragon, but the dragon's change of alignment caused {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} to reconsider their relationship.

They wisely acknowledge the archdruid as master of the forest and leave her animals and her dragon ally alone.": "村庄及其周围地区空旷了多年，直到一群妖精狼蝠在建筑物周围的洞穴中居住。与建筑相比，狼蝠更喜欢潮湿的山洞，而建筑大部分都已被遗弃。{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}允许狼蝠以流浪的害虫和冒险者为食。他们明智地承认大德鲁伊是森林的主人，并让她的动物和她的龙盟友独处。",

	"The castle looks small enough to fit in a 20-foot-cube, and it floats at the center of an {@condition invisible} 40-foot-radius sphere of transmutation magic that shrinks all creatures and objects in its area to one-twelfth their normal size.

Characters who enter the sphere can tell something has happened when Maddgoth's castle suddenly looms twelve times larger in their vision.": "城堡看起来小到可以装进一个20英尺的立方体，它漂浮在一个{@condition invisible}半径为40英尺的转化魔法球的中心，这个魔法球将其范围内的所有生物和物体缩小到正常尺寸的十二分之一。例如，一个6英尺高的人变成一个6英寸高的人。当进入球体的角色在他们的视野中突然出现十二倍大的马德戈斯的城堡时，就可以知道发生了什么事。",
	"A shrunken creature or object reverts to its normal size once it leaves the sphere, which is generated by the mithral spindle. No saving throw is allowed to resist the shrinking effect, and nothing short of divine intervention can suppress the spindle's magic. The spindle is impervious to damage, and it generates a magical repulsion field that prevents creatures from approaching any closer to it than 5 feet.": "被缩小的生物或物体一旦离开由密特拉尔纺锤产生的球体，就会恢复到正常大小。没有人可以抵御缩小的效果，而且没有任何东西可以抑制纺锤的魔力，只有神圣的干预。纺锤不受伤害，并产生一个魔法排斥场，防止生物接近它超过5英尺。",

	"Every time Qurrok loses his memory, he forgets about his previous excursions to the bottom of this cavern. He lowers himself to the floor, discovers the mithral spindle, and tries to climb it to see what's at the top. Rebuffed and discouraged by the repulsion field that surrounds the spindle, he starts combing the cavern floor for treasure.": "每次Qurrok失忆时，他都会忘记自己以前在这个洞穴底部的游览经历。他把自己降到地板上，发现了米塔尔纺锤，并试图爬上它，看看上面有什么。纺锤周围的排斥力场使他感到沮丧，他开始在洞穴地板上寻找宝藏。",

	"If a creature that is reduced to one-twelfth its normal size falls from the castle, it will travel over 600 relative feet before hitting the cavern floor due to the reducing effect around the castle, which turns every foot of actual distance into 12 feet of relative distance. From its perspective, the creature would seem to fall several hundred feet before suddenly growing twelve times bigger in the final 40 feet before impact. Because the reducing effect creates more relative distance between the creature and the cavern floor, a fall from anywhere on the castle deals {@dice 20d6} bludgeoning damage on impact.": "如果一个被缩小到正常大小的十二分之一的生物从城堡上掉下来，由于城堡周围的缩小效应，它在落到洞穴地面之前会走过600多英尺的相对距离，这使得每英尺的实际距离变成12英尺的相对距离。从它的角度来看，这个生物似乎要坠落几百英尺，然后在撞击前的最后40英尺内突然变大12倍。由于缩小效应在生物和洞穴地板之间创造了更多的相对距离，从城堡的任何地方坠落都会造成{@dice 20d6}撞击伤害。",
	"Halaster constructed this castle to serve as a temporary residence for guests, then abandoned it when he decided he didn't really want the company.

	"{@creature Otto|WDMM}'s favorite prank is to sneak up on a guest, engulf it in a cloud of euphoria gas, and sneak away while remaining {@condition invisible} the whole time.

	"Casting a spell that requires concentration causes the faerie dragon to become visible—after which it can move, cast a spell that doesn't require concentration (such as color spray or hallucinatory terrain), and use its bonus action to turn {@condition invisible} again. {@creature Otto|WDMM} is careful about casting spells that require concentration, because it can't concentrate on the spell and stay {@condition invisible} at the same time. It normally casts mirror image before casting a spell that requires concentration, trusting that its images will protect it while it maintains concentration on the spell. If {@creature Otto|WDMM} succeeds in incapacitating a guest, it tries to remove the guest's weapons and gear, then spends the next hour hiding these items throughout the castle.": "施放一个需要集中注意力的法术会使法龙变得可见-之后它可以移动，施放一个不需要集中注意力的法术（比如颜色喷射或幻觉地形），并使用它的额外行动再次转向（％0％）。{@creature Otto|WDMM}在施放需要集中注意力的法术时很小心，因为它不能同时集中注意力于法术和保持{@condition invisible}。它通常会在施展需要集中注意力的法术前施放镜像，相信它的图像会在它保持对法术的注意力时保护它。如果{@creature Otto|WDMM}成功地使一个客人失去能力，它就会试图拿走客人的武器和装备，然后在接下来的一个小时里把这些物品藏在城堡的各个角落。",

These lead sheets are designed to prevent magical senses from piercing the vault.": "这个金库很久以前就被掠夺了。10英尺高的墙壁上镶有金黄色的石砖。有几块砖已经松动，露出后面的薄铅片。这些铅片是为了防止魔法感应穿透金库而设计的。",
	"The lead door that once secured this room is bent inward at the bottom, creating a 3-foot-high triangular hole through which Medium and smaller creatures can fit.": "曾经固定这个房间的铅门在底部向内弯曲，形成一个3英尺高的三角洞，中型和小型生物可以通过。",

They include several humans and dwarves, as well as a few elves, drow, tieflings, quaggoths, duergar, hobgoblins, troglodytes, and githyanki. Until Netherskull summons them, the zombies remain here and attack intruders on sight. You can expedite combat by dividing the zombies into mobs of ten or fewer and using the mob rules in {@book chapter 8|DMG|8|Handling Mobs} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}.": "这些僵尸是被尼瑟斯库尔（Netherskull）杀死并被其负能量锥体激活的人类遗体。他们包括一些人类和矮人，以及一些精灵、乌鸦、铁弗林、夸哥特人、杜尔加人、霍布林人、troglodytes和githyanki。在尼瑟斯库尔召唤他们之前，这些僵尸一直呆在这里，一看到入侵者就会攻击他们。你可以通过将僵尸分成10个或更少的暴民，并使用{@book chapter 8|DMG|8|Handling Mobs}中的暴民规则来加速战斗。",

	"Hanging from the 30-foot-high, domed ceiling by three iron chains is a 6-foot-diameter carved stone beholder. Netherskull carved the statue using its carefully manipulated Disintegration Ray, but the rough sculpture is clearly the work of a talentless amateur. Each chain has AC 19, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Breaking all three chains causes the statue to fall and shatter on the floor.": "用三条铁链吊在30英尺高的圆顶上的是一个直径6英尺的石雕beholder。尼瑟斯库尔用它精心操纵的分解射线雕刻了这个雕像，但这个粗糙的雕塑显然是一个没有天赋的业余者的作品。每条链子都有AC19，25点命中率，并对毒药和精神伤害免疫。打断所有三条链子会导致雕像倒下并在地上碎裂。",
	"This dusty passage circumvents the adamantine doors to Netherskull's lair (see {@area area 39c|816|x}) and is hidden behind two secret doors.

	"All doors leading to this area are 1-foot-thick, 7-foot-diameter adamantine disks molded to look like concentric rings of bones with a leering human skull at the center. The skull's nose cavity contains an adamantine keyhole. When one of Halaster's bone keys (see {@area areas 19|7ca|x} and {@area 30b|7f8}) is inserted into the lock and turned 90 degrees clockwise, four bolt locks slide back from the surrounding walls, and the door swings inward on adamantine hinges. The door remains open until it is closed, and the key can be removed at any time. Without the proper key, it takes four separate {@spell knock} spells to open one of these doors, each spell causing one bolt to slide back. The doors are otherwise impregnable.": "通往这个区域的所有门都是1英尺厚、7英尺直径的金刚砂盘，其模子看起来像同心圆的骨头，中心是一个淫荡的人类头骨。头骨的鼻腔里有一个金刚砂钥匙孔。当哈拉斯特的一把骨钥匙（见{@area areas 19|7ca|x}和{@area 30b|7f8}）插入锁中并顺时针旋转90度时，四个螺栓锁就会从周围的墙壁上滑下来，门就会在金刚砂铰链上向内摆动。门一直开着，直到关闭，钥匙可以随时取出。如果没有合适的钥匙，需要四个独立的（2%）法术才能打开其中的一扇门，每个法术都会导致一个门栓滑回。除此之外，这些门是坚不可摧的。",
	"There is no keyhole on the inside of the doors. Instead, each door has an adamantine wheel in the middle of it that must be turned counterclockwise to slide back the bolts. This wheel can also be used as a handle to pull the heavy door open. When Netherskull wants to leave the room through a door, it uses its Telekinetic Ray to turn the wheel and leaves the door open until it returns.": "门的内部没有钥匙孔。相反，每扇门的中间都有一个金刚轮，必须逆时针转动才能将螺栓滑回。这个轮子也可以作为一个把手，将沉重的门拉开。当尼瑟斯库尔想通过一扇门离开房间时，它就用它的心灵感应射线来转动轮子，让门开着直到它回来。",
	"If the characters haven't silenced the level's play-by-play announcer (see \"{@area Halaster's Play-by-Play|78d|x}\"), it becomes increasingly excited as the battle with the death tyrant unfolds. If they defeat Netherskull, the announcer screams, \"How could this happen?! This is unbelievable! This might be the greatest upset in the history of Undermountain!\" It then falls silent for the rest of the time the characters spend on this level.": "如果角色们没有让关卡的播音员安静下来（见\"{@area Halaster's Play-by-Play|78d|x}\"），随着与死亡暴君战斗的展开，播音员会变得越来越兴奋。如果他们打败了尼瑟斯库尔，播音员会尖叫：\"这怎么可能发生？这真是难以置信! 这可能是冥山历史上最伟大的一次失意！\" 然后，在人物在这一关度过的剩余时间里，它就会陷入沉默。",
	"The death tyrant carved out this immense chasm using its Disintegration Ray, and Halaster added his own touches by flooding it with lava and confounding magical flight within the chasm.": "死亡暴君用它的瓦解射线凿出了这个巨大的鸿沟，而哈拉斯特则通过用熔岩淹没它和在鸿沟内迷惑魔法飞行来增加自己的润色。",
	"Spells and magic items that allow creatures to fly are suppressed within the chasm. Any character who enters the chasm under the effect of a {@spell fly} spell or similar magic goes hurtling down into the lava. Spells that slow one's fall (such as {@spell feather fall}) function normally.": "允许生物飞行的法术和魔法物品在鸿沟内会受到抑制。任何在{@spell fly}法术或类似魔法作用下进入鸿沟的角色都会急速坠入岩浆。减缓坠落速度的法术（例如（1%））可以正常使用。",

	"Netherskull's regional effects end with the death tyrant's destruction, and Halaster takes his time replacing the creature. Eventually he settles on abducting several beholders, releasing them in the Obstacle Course, and letting them vie for control of the level until only one remains. Halaster plans to help the winner transform itself into a new death tyrant.": "尼瑟斯库尔的区域效应随着死亡暴君的毁灭而结束，哈拉斯特慢慢地取代了这个生物。最终，他决定绑架几个持有者，把他们放进障碍赛场，让他们争夺关卡的控制权，直到只剩下一个。哈拉斯特计划帮助获胜者将自己变成一个新的死亡暴君。",

	"Githyanki recently turned the Crystal Labyrinth into an outpost of their interplanar empire.

Uncertainty about its own future has forced Extremiton to hold off on transforming into an elder brain. Instead, it is focused on defending the colony and destroying its githyanki neighbors. With only a dozen mind flayers remaining under its rule, Extremiton has resorted to breeding a neothelid (see {@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}) and plans to set it loose in the Crystal Labyrinth to finally wipe out the githyanki force. Extremiton is also gathering thralls of every race to help defend the colony if the neothelid is destroyed or fails in its task.": "通过illithids不知道的方法，githyanki的先锋部队追踪他们攻击殖民地的幸存者到了Undermountain。在最近获得了附近的水晶迷宫({@adventure level 16|WDMM|16})之后，githyanki现在开始对Seadeeps的思想传播者发动战争。对自己未来的不确定感迫使艾斯米顿暂缓转变为长老级的大脑。相反，它专注于保卫殖民地和摧毁它的邻居吉特汉基。在它的统治下，只剩下十几个心灵传播者，Extremiton已经求助于繁殖一个neothelid（见{@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}），并计划把它放进水晶迷宫，最终消灭githyanki的力量。埃斯特里米顿还在收集各个种族的傀儡，以便在新海怪被摧毁或任务失败时帮助保卫殖民地。",
	"Extremiton can sense intelligent creatures within 2 miles of it and is able to communicate with them telepathically. Using this ability judiciously, the ulitharid has learned a great deal about the city above and its inhabitants. Waterdeep has, in a way, captured the ulitharid's imagination.": "Extremiton可以感知周围2英里内的智能生物，并能与它们进行心灵感应。谨慎地使用这种能力，乌利塔里德已经对上面的城市和它的居民了解了很多。在某种程度上，沃特迪普已经俘获了乌利塔里德的想象力。",
	"Extremiton intends to enslave the population of Waterdeep, but not before it fully understands this strange city and its people. The telepathic communications the ulitharid has initiated with random Waterdavians has provided it with plenty of information, but no firsthand knowledge of how city dwellers behave and react on a daily basis.": "Extremiton打算奴役水底世界的居民，但在它完全了解这个陌生的城市和它的人民之前。Ulitharid与随机的Waterdavians进行的心灵感应为它提供了大量的信息，但对城市居民的日常行为和反应没有第一手的了解。",
	"In the heart of Seadeeps, the ulitharid has built an enormous dynamo that channels the energy of an underground river to power a series of interconnected metal capsules called psipods. The illithids under Extremiton's command have kidnapped humanoids from Waterdeep and Undermountain and put them to sleep in these capsules, which link their dreaming minds to the ulitharid's dizzying intellect. These captives believe they're in Waterdeep, but the city they see and experience around them is a fabrication created wholly by the ulitharid. Within this alternate reality Waterdeep, or \"Alterdeep,\" Extremiton appears as any character it wants. Its favorite role to play is that of Durnan, the gruff, tight-lipped proprietor of the Yawning Portal.": "在Seadeeps的中心地带，乌利塔里德（ulitharid）建造了一个巨大的发电机，引导地下河的能量为一系列相互连接的金属舱提供动力，称为psipods。在Extremiton的指挥下，illithids绑架了来自Waterdeep和Undermountain的人类，让他们在这些胶囊里睡觉，这些胶囊将他们的梦境与ulitharid令人眩晕的智力联系起来。这些俘虏相信他们是在沃特德普，但他们所看到和体验到的城市是完全由ulitharid制造的。在这个交替现实的沃特德普（Waterdeep），或称 \"Alterdeep\"，Extremiton以它想要的任何角色出现。它最喜欢扮演的角色是杜南（Durnan），一个粗暴的、沉默寡言的 \"打哈欠门户 \"的经营者。",
	"Extremiton can make any environmental changes to Alterdeep and observe how its captive audience reacts. Meanwhile, it continues to use its telepathy to reach out to the Waterdavians in the city above, gathering more information to better realize its version of the city.": "Extremiton可以对Alterdeep进行任何环境改变，并观察其俘虏的观众的反应。同时，它继续使用心灵感应与上面的城市中的Waterdavians联系，收集更多的信息以更好地实现它的城市版本。",

	"Mounted on both sides of every door in the mind flayer colony ({@area areas 9|8c4|x} through {@area 20|8f0}) is a burnished plate of dark, alien metal embossed with a braille-like form of tactile writing known as Qualith. Mind flayers use their tentacles to read Qualith, which is composed in four-line stanzas indecipherable to other creatures. A creature that touches a Qualith inscription, however, can receive fragmentary insight into the multilayered thoughts contained in it. A non-illithid that wants to understand a Qualith inscription in Seadeeps can make a DC 18 Intelligence check to interpret the inscription. A failed attempt results in a crushing headache and requires the creature to succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or develop a random form of short-term madness (see \"{@book Madness|DMG|8|Madness}\" in chapter 8 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}). A comprehend languages spell provides understanding of the inscription roughly equivalent to what a mind flayer would get from it.": "安装在掠夺者殖民地的每扇门的两侧（{@area areas 9|8c4|x}到{@area 20|8f0}）的是一块漆黑的外星金属板，上面压印着一种类似盲文的触觉文字，称为Qualith。噬心者用他们的触角来阅读Qualith，它是由四行诗句组成的，其他生物无法破译。然而，触摸到Qualith铭文的生物可以获得对其中所包含的多层次思想的零星洞察力。一个非illithid想要理解Seadeeps中的Qualith铭文，可以进行DC18智力测验来解释铭文。失败的结果是头痛欲裂，并要求该生物在DC11的智慧救赎中获得成功，或者发展出一种随机形式的短期疯狂（见《{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}》第8章中的\"{@book Madness|DMG|8|Madness}\"）。一个理解语言的法术提供了对铭文的理解，大致上相当于一个思想骗子会从铭文中得到的东西。",

	"A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the pit. Each time part of the statue is disturbed, the pit magically snaps shut like a giant mouth and then slowly opens again. Creatures in the pit when it closes are crushed between its rocky walls and must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 88 ({@dice 16d10}) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

	"Alterdeep looks, sounds, smells, and feels like Waterdeep. Prolonged exposure to this alternate world, however, increases the possibility of detecting a flaw that betrays its true nature. Although Extremiton has created an impressive facsimile, characters who are drawn into the environment notice slight discrepancies in the way familiar NPCs act, or pick up on minor details that the ulitharid has gotten wrong or can't reasonably duplicate: slight changes in decor, books that are blank between the covers, foul-tasting elven wine, dwarves unable to speak Dwarvish, and so on.": "阿尔特迪普的外观、声音、气味和感觉都与沃特迪普一样。然而，长期暴露在这个另类世界中，会增加发现暴露其真实性质的缺陷的可能性。尽管埃斯特里米顿创造了一个令人印象深刻的复制品，但被吸引到这个环境中的人物会注意到熟悉的NPC的行为方式有细微的差异，或者发现一些小细节，而这些小细节是乌利塔里德人弄错了或者无法合理复制的：装饰的轻微变化、封面之间空白的书、味道难闻的精灵酒、不能说矮人语的矮人，等等。",
	"As soon as a character encounters such a discrepancy, the ulitharid also becomes aware of it, since their minds are linked. When confronted with an error, Extremiton either takes steps to correct it or tries to draw attention away from it. For example, it doesn't know Dwarvish well enough to cause the residents of Alterdeep to speak it fluently, so it might subtly remove all known Dwarvish-speaking characters from the simulation until its familiarity with that language improves significantly.": "只要一个角色遇到这种差异，乌利塔里德也会意识到它，因为他们的思想是相通的。当面对一个错误时，Extremiton要么采取措施来纠正它，要么试图将注意力从它身上转移开。例如，它对矮人语的了解还不足以让阿尔特迪普的居民说流利的矮人语，所以它可能会巧妙地将所有已知的说矮人语的角色从模拟中移除，直到它对这种语言的熟悉程度明显提高。",
	"The most accurate and fleshed-out location in Alterdeep is the Yawning Portal. Extremiton is particularly fascinated with the establishment, its owner, and its clientele. Most newcomers to the simulation awaken here, and Extremiton tries to create enough situations of interest in the tavern to keep its captive audience engaged. Extremiton appears in the Yawning Portal as its gruff proprietor, Durnan, though it can inhabit other fake NPCs as well. The ulitharid has focused most of its attention on the Yawning Portal because that location sits atop the entrance to Undermountain and is a hotbed of humanoid interaction.": "在Alterdeep，最准确、最丰满的地点是 \"打哈欠的门\"。Extremiton对这个场所、它的主人和它的顾客特别着迷。大多数新来的人都是在这里觉醒的，Extremiton试图在酒馆中创造足够多的有趣的情况，以保持其俘虏的观众。灭绝师太在 \"打哈欠的门 \"中以粗鲁的老板杜南的身份出现，不过它也可以在其他假的NPC身上出现。这只乌利塔利德把大部分注意力集中在打哈欠的门上，因为这个地方位于地下山的入口处，是一个人形互动的温床。",
	"Creatures can be hurt, healed, and killed in the simulation just as they can be in the real world, and a character reduced to 0 hit points makes death saving throws as normal.

Creatures immune to psychic damage can't be killed by this kind of system shock and stabilize automatically inside the simulation.": "生物在模拟中可以被伤害、治疗和杀死，就像它们在现实世界中一样，而且一个角色的命中率降至0，可以像普通人一样进行死亡储蓄。任何通过进入psipod加入模拟的生物，如果在模拟中死亡，也会在真实世界中因震荡而死亡，就像它受到足够的精神伤害而立即死亡一样。对精神伤害免疫的生物不会被这种系统冲击杀死，并在模拟中自动稳定下来。",
	"If characters in the simulation try to escape Alterdeep's city limits, Extremiton creates situations to dissuade them: bad weather, a city-wide lockdown, a festival—whatever it takes. The ulitharid hasn't researched areas outlying the city. Consequently, nothing but thick fog lies beyond the city gates. The same is true for Alterdeep's version of Undermountain; characters who descend the well in the Yawning Portal taproom find themselves enshrouded in fog with nowhere to go but back up. Extremiton, in the guise of Durnan, discourages exploration of Undermountain by claiming that the Mad Mage has magically sealed it off. Characters who are brought into the simulation can escape only if Extremiton allows it or if their psipods are shut down. The ulitharid might remove one or more characters from the simulation if it finds them too disruptive, in which case they're taken out of their psipods and confined to area 10 until they can be fed to the neothelid in area 8. The characters can also try to form an alliance with the ulitharid. Extremiton might release them if, in exchange, they promise to destroy the githyanki that are threatening the mind flayer colony. You can roleplay these interactions or have the characters make ability checks to convince Extremiton to let them back into the real world.": "如果模拟中的人物试图逃离Alterdeep的城市范围，Extremiton会创造一些情况来劝阻他们：恶劣的天气、全城封锁、节日--不管是什么情况。ulitharid还没有研究过城市外围的地区。因此，城门外除了浓雾，什么都没有。阿尔特迪普的地下山也是如此；从 \"打哈欠的门 \"自来水房的井里下来的人物发现自己被雾气笼罩，除了往上走之外无处可去。杜南（Durnan）假扮的艾斯米顿（Extremiton）声称疯狂法师已经用魔法封住了地下山，因此不鼓励人们探索地下山。被带入模拟的角色只有在Extremiton允许或他们的psipods被关闭的情况下才能逃脱。如果Ulitharid发现一个或多个角色太具破坏性，它可能会将他们从模拟中移除，在这种情况下，他们会被从psipods中取出，并被限制在10区，直到他们可以被喂给8区的neothelid。这些角色也可以尝试与乌利塔里德人结成联盟。如果作为交换，Extremiton可能会释放他们，他们会承诺摧毁威胁到心灵火器殖民地的Githyanki。你可以在这些互动中扮演角色，或者让角色进行能力检查，以说服Extremiton让他们回到现实世界中。",

	"Confronted by failure, Vanrak came to believe that Shar had deceived him and had orchestrated his downfall solely to spite her nemesis, Selûne. Vanrak had lost his family, his title, and most of his army, and he was in danger of losing hold over his domain.

Portia thinks {@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}'s curse can be undone by ridding the dragon of its despair, but she has no idea how to accomplish this. She and her companions were captured less than a month ago, but Portia has lost track of time and believes she has been imprisoned in Vanrakdoom for much longer. The{@creature vampire spawn} feed on Portia whenever blood is in short supply, and she has the bite marks to prove it. After each feeding, Keresta charms Portia to keep her calm and under control.": "{@creature Portia Dzuth|WDMM}来自Rashemen。她是水底世界的怀恩德-月星女士雇佣的冒险队伍中唯一的幸存者，她要找到{@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}影子龙，并将它变回{@creature Glyster|WDMM}青铜龙，月星家族的朋友。波西亚认为{@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}的诅咒可以通过让龙摆脱绝望来解除，但她不知道如何完成这个任务。她和她的同伴们在不到一个月前被俘，但波西亚已经忘记了时间，她相信自己被囚禁在凡拉克多姆的时间更长。每当血液短缺时，{@creature vampire spawn}就以波西亚为食，她身上的咬痕可以证明这一点。每次进食后，凯斯塔都会对波西亚施以魅力，使她保持平静并受到控制。",
	"Portia sank into madness and despair after she was forced to watch {@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM} devour the corpses of her slain companions one by one. She stays close to her rescuers, serving as a loyal follower until she is safely out of Undermountain or until Keresta asks her to betray them. While fighting on the party's side, Portia claims an equal share of all XP gained. She is a {@creature champion|VGM} (see {@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}), with these changes:": "波西亚在被迫看着{@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}被杀的同伴们的尸体一个个被吞噬后，陷入了疯狂和绝望。她一直紧跟在救她的人身边，作为一个忠诚的追随者，直到她安全地离开了地下山，或者直到凯斯塔要求她背叛他们。在为党派战斗的时候，波西亚要求平等分享所有获得的XP。她是一个{@creature champion|VGM}（见{@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}），有这些变化。",

	"{@b Double Door}. The doors in the east wall stand 18 feet high, a carving of a mighty waterfall spanning their surfaces. Mithral inlays make the carved falls look like they are running with molten metal.": "{@b Double Door}. 东墙的门有18英尺高，雕刻着一个强大的瀑布，横跨其表面。密特拉尔的镶嵌物使雕刻的瀑布看起来像是在流淌着熔融的金属。",
	"{@b Curtain}. A 40-foot-long, 20-foot-high curtain of black dragon scales hangs from an iron rod bolted to the west wall. (The scales have become brittle with age and are not valuable.)": "{@b Curtain}. 一道40英尺长、20英尺高的黑色龙鳞帘子挂在栓在西墙上的铁杆上。(这些鳞片随着时间的推移已经变的很脆了，没有价值了。)",

	"The giant horn weighs 2 tons. It dangles 20 feet above the floor on three thick, 5-foot-long iron chains. The Melairkyn dwarves forged the horn and placed it here to guard the treasure in this hall (see \"Treasure\" below). A {@spell detect magic} spell or similar magic reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the horn. A character who understands Dwarvish can translate the horn's runes, not all of which are visible from the floor. The runes visible from the floor read, \"If you blind us.\" A character must fly up to the horn or climb above it to read the message in its entirety, which is \"If you blind us, shall we not revenge?\"": "巨型号角重达2吨。它悬挂在离地面20英尺高的地方，有三条5英尺长的粗铁链子。Melairkyn矮人铸造了这个号角，并把它放在这里，以守护这个大厅里的宝藏（见下面的 \"宝藏\"）。一个{@spell detect magic}的咒语或类似的魔法在号角周围显示出一个魔法的光环。一个懂矮人语的人可以翻译号角上的符文，但并不是所有的符文都能从地面上看到。从地面上可以看到的符文是：\"如果你弄瞎了我们\"。一个角色必须飞到号角上，或者爬到它上面，才能读到完整的信息，那就是 \"如果你弄瞎了我们的眼睛，我们不应该报复吗？\"",
	"Removing one or more gemstones from the pillars causes the horn to magically emit a somber tone. As the horn sounds, the spirits of thirteen dwarf warriors appear in unoccupied spaces throughout the hall and attack all other creatures in the area. These unaligned spirits use the {@creature champion|VGM} statistics (see {@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}), except that they wield greataxes instead of greatswords. They understand Dwarvish but can't speak, and they can't leave the hall. They disappear after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once the horn has sounded, it can't sound again until 7 days have passed. If no gemstones remain in the pillars when this time elapses, the horn becomes nonmagical and can no longer summon dwarven spirits. Removing the instrument from the hall also renders it nonmagical.": "从柱子上取下一颗或多颗宝石会使号角神奇地发出阴郁的音调。随着号角的响起，十三个矮人战士的灵魂会出现在整个大厅无人的地方，并攻击该地区的所有其他生物。这些不结盟的灵魂使用{@creature champion|VGM}的统计数据（见{@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}），只是他们挥舞大斧而不是大剑。他们能听懂矮人语，但不能说话，也不能离开大厅。他们在1小时后或当他们的生命值下降到0时就会消失。一旦号角响起，它就不会再响起，直到7天过去。如果在这段时间过后，柱子里没有宝石，那么号角就会变得没有魔力，不再能召唤矮人的灵魂。将乐器从大厅中移出也会使其失去魔力。",
	"Eight blue star sapphires (1,000 gp each) are embedded in the eyes of the dwarf carvings—two gemstones per pillar. Each gem is set 18 feet above the floor and can be pried out with a dagger or similar tool.": "八颗蓝色的星形蓝宝石（每颗1,000金币）嵌在矮人雕刻的眼睛里--每根柱子两颗宝石。每颗宝石都镶嵌在离地面18英尺的地方，可以用匕首或类似工具撬出来。",
	"The room has a flat, 10-foot-high ceiling.

	"To prepare for their roles, the arcanaloths learned everything they could about Laduguer's principles of conduct. To their surprise, Aximus and Exekarus found these principles compelling.

The arcanaloths' attitude changes to friendly if the characters appeal to their love of magic by giving them a single very rare magic item, multiple rare magic items, or a spellbook containing at least one spell of 6th level or higher. Aximus and Exekarus make their love of all things magical known to anyone that seeks their assistance. If their attitude toward the characters is changed in this way, the arcanaloths repay the party's kindness any way they can—short of placing themselves in harm's way. Their helpfulness doesn't last long, however. After 24 hours, the arcanaloths' attitude toward the party becomes indifferent once more, and further bribes are needed to regain their assistance.": "弓箭手一开始对角色的态度是冷漠的，但如果受到攻击，他们很快就会变成敌对的。如果角色给他们一件非常稀有的魔法物品、多件稀有的魔法物品，或者一本至少包含一个6级以上的法术的魔法书，那么阿卡纳罗斯的态度就会转变为友好。Aximus和Exekarus向任何寻求他们帮助的人表明了他们对所有魔法事物的热爱。如果他们对角色的态度以这种方式改变了，阿卡纳罗斯就会以任何方式来回报他们的善意，而不会把自己置于危险之中。然而，他们的帮助并没有持续很久。24小时后，阿卡纳罗特人的态度会再次变得冷漠，需要进一步的贿赂来重新获得他们的帮助。",

Their brother, Xerrion, came to possess the tablet and used it to contact otherworldly beings in an attempt to destroy his family's business rivals and political enemies. This contact drove Xerrion mad, and it didn't take long for the madness to spread to other members of the Shadowdusk family and come into public view. As the family's behavior grew more bizarre, local broadsheets circulated rumors that the Shadowdusks had been replaced by aberrant horrors in human guise. Their ancestral villa, Shadowdusk Hold, was burned to the ground in the Year of the Harp (1355 DR).

He might suggest that those characters prove their worth by surviving the Mad Wizard's Lair and \"freeing up\" an apprenticeship by eliminating {@creature Arcturia|WDMM} or {@creature Trobriand|WDMM}.

A creature that gazes into the mirror sees its reflection take the form of a female gnome in leather armor. She speaks Common and Gnomish, and is surprised to see the characters.

Her hunger for magic set her on an evil path as she hunted down and killed other wizards to acquire their spellbooks. Before old age could claim her, Branta transformed herself into a lich. In this form, she came to Undermountain to plunder its magic. Halaster captured and enslaved her, promising to free her if she helped him brew potions. Tragically, that promise went unfulfilled.": "这个demilich是Branta Myntion的全部遗物，他是一个落入坏人堆里的巫师。她对魔法的渴望使她走上了一条邪恶的道路，她追杀其他巫师以获得他们的法术书。在她年老之前，布兰塔把自己变成了一个巫师。在这种形态下，她来到冥山掠夺其魔法。哈拉斯特抓住并奴役了她，并承诺如果她帮助他制作魔药就会释放她。可悲的是，这个承诺没有兑现。",
	"Deprived of the ability to feed souls into her phylactery, which lies hidden in a dungeon far from Waterdeep, Branta's skeletal form deteriorated. Now, over a century later, only her skull remains.

	"Although powerful wards prevent the demilich from leaving Halaster's tower, the tower is not considered its lair. Consequently, the demilich doesn't gain lair actions, nor does the tower exhibit the demilich's lair traits.": "尽管强大的防御措施阻止了恶魔离开哈拉斯特的塔，但塔并不被认为是它的巢穴。因此，妖怪不会获得巢穴行动，塔也不会表现出妖怪的巢穴特征。",

	"A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around one of the bottles. Uncorking this bottle causes an elder rune to appear in the air above it (see \"{@area Elder Runes|027|x}\"). The rune targets the creature that opened the bottle. If the bottle was opened with a {@spell mage hand} spell or similar magic, the rune targets the caster of the spell, provided the caster is within 60 feet of the opened bottle. Determine the rune randomly by drawing a card from the Elder Runes Deck (see {@adventure appendix B|WDMM|26}).": "一个{@spell detect magic}的咒语揭示了其中一个瓶子周围的堕落魔法的光环。打开这个瓶子会导致一个长老符文出现在瓶子上方的空气中（见\"{@area Elder Runes|027|x}\"）。这个符文的目标是打开瓶子的生物。如果瓶子是用{@spell mage hand}法术或类似的魔法打开的，那么符文的目标是施法者，只要施法者在开瓶的60英尺内。通过从上古符文牌中抽出一张牌来随机确定符文（见{@adventure appendix B|WDMM|26}）。",

Whether Jhesiyra remains disembodied or assumes a corporeal form when she usurps Halaster's control over Undermountain is also for you to decide, but one thing she won't do is reactivate Halaster's gates. She doesn't trust them and would prefer to create her own gates in due time.

	"If Jhesiyra is unable to seize control of Undermountain, she continues to lurk in the dungeon as a disembodied entity, waiting for another opportunity to emerge. Unaware of Jhesiyra's attempt to dethrone him, Halaster re-forms in Undermountain as he has done many times before. He doesn't take being killed personally, but it inspires him to toughen Undermountain's defenses so that the next group of adventurers can't thwart him so easily. Much of his time in the coming months is spent creating a new demiplane and a new tower to replace the ones that were destroyed after he died.": "如果杰西拉无法夺取冥山的控制权，她就会继续以失魂落魄的姿态潜伏在地牢中，等待另一个出现的机会。由于不知道杰西拉试图推翻他的统治，哈拉斯特像以前多次那样在地下山重新形成。他对自己被杀并不以为然，但这也激励着他加强地下山的防御，使下一批冒险者不能轻易挫败他。在接下来的几个月里，他的大部分时间都花在创建一个新的半位面和一个新的塔，以取代他死后被摧毁的那些。",
	"Skullport is a grim, cutthroat outpost of civilization where adventurers can resupply and take refuge.

Where the locks end is a vast cavern containing a smooth stone retaining wall that rises 10 feet above the water's surface. The partially collapsed remnants of a ten-story-tall hoist loom above the retaining wall. This contraption was designed to lift a vessel of almost any size, swing it over the wall, and lower it down the other side to the River Sargauth 100 feet below. Skullport lies just a few hundred yards farther along the underground river. Time and neglect have rendered the hoist nonfunctional, thus preventing large ships from reaching the Port of Shadow. Many denizens of Skullport would like to fix it, but they lack the mutual trust and cooperation required for such a project to succeed. The absence of the hoist hasn't stopped all manner of nefarious sorts from using their own ropes to haul rowboats and other small craft over the barrier wall.": "随着人们向山的深处行进，水变得越来越平静，那里有一系列的魔法锁控制着水位。船只在它们之间经过时，会下降数百英尺。锁的尽头是一个巨大的洞穴，里面有一堵光滑的石头挡墙，高出水面10英尺。一座十层楼高的升降机的部分坍塌的残余物在挡土墙上晃动。这个装置被设计用来举起几乎任何大小的船只，将其摆过墙面，并将其从另一侧降到100英尺以下的萨尔高斯河。斯库尔波特就在沿地下河的几百码远处。随着时间的推移和疏忽，这个升降机已经无法使用了，因此大型船只无法到达阴影港。斯库尔波特的许多居民都想修复它，但他们缺乏这样一个项目成功所需的相互信任和合作。起重机的缺失并没有阻止各种邪恶的人用他们自己的绳索将划艇和其他小型船只拖过隔离墙。",

Casting {@spell dispel magic} on the figurehead renders it nonmagical. Unless its magic is dispelled, the banshee figurehead lets out a tremendous wail if any creature other than a sea hag approaches within 10 feet of the {@creature crow|WDMM}'s nest. The banshee's wail echoes throughout the cavern and can be heard as far away as {@area area 10c|1c0|x}.
