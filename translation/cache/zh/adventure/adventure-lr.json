	"The Sea of Fallen Stars connects the eastern and western sides of Faerûn. Many nations that border shorelines along its vast expanse also maintain major navies and trade fleets. A plethora of creatures and humanoid races typically found in the ocean depths live there, including sahuagin, sea elves, merfolk, and locathah.": "堕落之星之海连接着法鲁恩的东部和西部。许多沿其广阔的海岸线的国家也保持着主要的海军和贸易舰队。那里生活着大量通常在海洋深处发现的生物和类人种族，包括萨瓦金人、海精灵、人鱼族和洛萨塔。",
	"This is a story about what happens when a normally peaceful species is pushed to the point of open conflict. As elemental forces threaten the safety of the nearby locathah communities, heroes rise from among their number to strike back and defend their homes and families. {@i Locathah Rising} is a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure designed for 9th-level characters. You can run this adventure for as few as three or as many as six players. Depending on your play style, this adventure may take several game sessions to complete, but by its conclusion the characters should advance to 10th level.": "这是一个关于当一个通常和平的物种被推到公开冲突的地步时会发生什么的故事。当元素的力量威胁到附近locathah社区的安全时，英雄们从他们中间崛起，进行反击，保卫他们的家园和家人。{@i Locathah Rising}是一个为9级人物设计的DUNGEONS & DRAGONS冒险。你可以为少至3名或多至6名玩家运行这个冒险。根据你的游戏风格，这个冒险可能需要几个游戏环节来完成，但在结束时，人物应该会提升到10级。",
	"To run this adventure, you need the D&D fifth edition core rulebooks: the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, and {@book Monster Manual|MM}. The {@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|SCAG} is helpful but not necessary. The {@book Monster Manual|MM} contains stat blocks for most of the creatures found in this adventure. All the necessary stat blocks are included there or in appendix A. When a creature's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue for you to look up the creature's stat block in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, unless the adventure's text instead refers you to the monster appendix in this adventure.": "要运行这个冒险，你需要D&D第五版核心规则书：{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}、{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}和{@book Monster Manual|MM}。{@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|SCAG}是有帮助的，但不是必须的。{@book Monster Manual|MM}包含了本冒险中发现的大多数生物的状态块。所有必要的状态块都包括在这里或附录A中。当一个生物的名字以{@b bold}的字体出现时，那是一个视觉提示，让你在{@book Monster Manual|MM}中查找该生物的状态块，除非冒险的文字让你去看本冒险中的怪物附录。",
	"At various places, the adventure presents descriptive text that's meant to be read or paraphrased aloud to the players. This read-aloud text is offset in boxes like this one. Boxed text is most commonly used to describe locations or present bits of scripted dialogue.": "在不同的地方，冒险中出现了描述性的文字，这些文字是为了让玩家朗读或转述的。这种朗读的文字在像这样的方框中被抵消。盒子里的文字最常用于描述地点或呈现剧本中的对话片段。",
	"This adventure contains advice for adjusting encounters based on the number of characters in the party. You are empowered to modify the number of enemies in an encounter and their hit point totals as you see fit. If you need to adjust the difficulty of an encounter during combat, you can alter hit point totals without the player characters ever knowing and have enemies retreat or reinforcements arrive as needed.": "这个冒险包含了根据聚会中的人物数量调整遭遇战的建议。你有权在你认为合适的时候修改遭遇战中的敌人数量和他们的命中率总数。如果你需要在战斗中调整遭遇战的难度，你可以在玩家角色不知道的情况下改变打击点总数，并根据需要让敌人撤退或增援部队到来。",
	"The adventure begins as the characters, a stalwart band of locathah, seek answers to the disturbance of wind and wave so close to their homes.": "冒险开始了，主人公们是一伙坚韧不拔的当地人，他们在离家这么近的地方寻找风和浪的干扰的答案。",
	"What they discover is a new risen node of elemental evil, pulsing with a power harvested by {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}, an interloping surface-dweller who has become a prophet of Umberlee, the Queen of the Depths herself.": "他们所发现的是一个新崛起的元素邪恶节点，它被{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}收获的力量所推动，{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}是一个混迹于地表的人，已经成为Umberlee的先知，深渊女王本人。",
	"It's up to these normally quiet fish-folk to seal a rift Gar opened to draw power directly from the Elemental Plane of Water and put an end to his machinations.": "这就需要这些平时沉默寡言的鱼民来封住加尔打开的裂缝，直接从水元素界汲取力量，结束他的阴谋。",
	"A few years ago, four elemental prophets led their respective cults in a quasi-unified effort to rain unprecedented destruction down upon the Sword Coast.": "几年前，四位元素预言家带领他们各自的邪教组织进行了一次准统一的努力，将前所未有的破坏降临到剑海岸。",
	"{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR} was one of these prophets. Dour and morose, Gar became the prophet of Olhydra, the elemental Princess of Evil Water, and the leader of the Crushing Wave cult. He was embittered by a life of suffering at the hands of others: pirates killed his family when he was young, he was forced into servitude aboard a merchant ship, and then another band of pirates left him to die on the open sea, where he lost his arm to a shark. Gar saw the elemental power of water as the only thing of value in his life and gathered others who felt similarly.": "{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}就是这些预言家之一。沉默寡言的加尔成为了邪恶水元素公主奥海德拉的先知，也是碎浪邪教的领袖。他因一生都在遭受他人的折磨而感到痛苦：海盗在他年幼时杀害了他的家人，他被迫在一艘商船上服役，然后另一伙海盗把他丢在公海上死去，在那里他被鲨鱼咬断了手臂。加尔将水的元素力量视为他生命中唯一有价值的东西，并聚集了有类似感觉的其他人。",
	"Gar wielded the elemental weapon Drown, a magical trident of great power, and his missing arm was replaced by an artificial limb in the shape of a crab's claw. As the leader of Olhydra's cult, he could channel her innate magic, which inspired awe and fear in the other Crushing Wave cultists.": "加尔挥舞着元素武器 \"淹没\"，这是一把具有巨大力量的神奇三叉戟，他缺失的手臂被一个螃蟹爪子形状的假肢所取代。作为奥海德拉邪教的领袖，他可以引导她与生俱来的魔力，这激发了其他碎浪派邪教徒的敬畏和恐惧。",
	"Fortunately for the denizens of the Sword Coast, heroes discovered the collective plots of the elemental prophets and put an end to their machinations, defeating each of them in turn, and sending each prophet back to the evil elemental being they revered and served.": "对剑海岸的居民来说，幸运的是，英雄们发现了元素先知的集体阴谋，并结束了他们的阴谋，依次打败了他们每个人，并把每个先知送回了他们所崇敬和服务的邪恶元素存在。",
	"On the Elemental Plane of Water, Gar raged in protest. Drown had been broken, and the Crushing Wave cult sundered. He faced Olhydra's displeasure, expecting to be destroyed by her wrath, and was astonished to awaken several years later, floating off the coast of Turmish in the Sea of Fallen Stars. He gripped a trident in one hand, though it was not Drown.": "在水元素位面，加尔愤怒地抗议着。淹没被打破了，破碎的波浪教派也被拆散了。他面对着奥海德拉的不满，期待着被她的愤怒所摧毁，并惊讶地在几年后醒来，漂浮在堕落星海中的图尔米什海岸边。他的一只手握着一把三叉戟，虽然那不是溺水。",
	"Gar discovered that the ancient weapon had been gifted to him by the sea goddess Umberlee who, in conjunction with Olhydra, managed to reinstate the prophet with power even more formidable than he previously enjoyed. The seas and the storms that raged above now heeded his commands, and—free of the original compact made with the other prophets—Gar could seek success unburdened by any past commitments.": "加尔发现，这把古老的武器是海神翁贝里赠送给他的，翁贝里与奥海德拉一起，设法让先知恢复了比他以前享有的更强大的力量。海洋和上面肆虐的风暴现在都听从他的命令，并且摆脱了与其他先知签订的原始契约，加尔可以不受过去任何承诺的影响而寻求成功。",
	"Gazing upon the trident, Gar looked for signs of the power that he felt surging within and was shocked when the trident spoke to him, \"I am WAVE, and we are ONE!\"": "凝视着三叉戟，加尔寻找着他感到内心涌动的力量的迹象，当三叉戟对他说话时，他感到很震惊：\"我是波浪，我们是一体的！\"",
	"With Wave in his possession, {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR} discovered and unlocked a node of elemental power deep beneath the waves, directly under the shipping lanes of those who transport themselves and other valuables across the Sea of Fallen Stars. There he opened a rift, drew on its power, and created a place where ships would be destroyed and dragged beneath the waves.": "有了 \"海浪\"，{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}发现并解锁了海浪深处的一个元素力量节点，该节点直接位于那些将自己和其他贵重物品运过堕落星海的人的航道之下。在那里，他打开了一个裂缝，汲取了它的力量，并创造了一个地方，船只将被摧毁并被拖到海浪之下。",
	"As ship after ship has been destroyed by wind and wave, they have come to rest in close proximity to where Gar has encouraged the preternatural growth of the coral and other such sea life to create his new lair. From his aquatic home, {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR} foments his plans to seek out and destroy all who dare to cross these waters without paying the proper tribute to Umberlee and Olhydra.": "随着一艘又一艘的船被风和浪摧毁，它们在加尔鼓励珊瑚和其他此类海洋生物超自然生长以创造他的新巢穴的地方附近休息。在他的水生家园里，{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}酝酿着他的计划，寻找并摧毁所有敢于穿越这些水域而不向Umberlee和Olhydra支付适当贡品的人。",
	"Unfortunately for Gar, his newfound power has drawn the attention of wizards of both Turmish and Thay. More fortunately for Gar, these two great nations are so embroiled in their own conflict with one another that neither has the resources to devote to exploring this newly charted area of danger. Instead, their ships choose to chart a course around the area, avoiding it altogether for the time being.": "对加尔来说，不幸的是，他新发现的力量已经引起了图尔米什和泰伊两国巫师的注意。对加尔来说更幸运的是，这两个伟大的国家都深陷于他们自己的冲突之中，以至于他们都没有资源来探索这个新绘制的危险区域。相反，他们的船只选择绕过该地区的航线，暂时完全避开它。",
	"Who might stand against the might of the elemental prophet? Perhaps new heroes will come to surface and seek out the source of these calamities. Coming from a quiet race of fish-folk, the locathah are indeed alarmed at the violent turn the waves have taken so near their home. Even now, champions rise from their ranks to seek answers and make the Sea of Fallen Stars safe once more for their people. This adventure includes the use of locathah as a playable character race, presented here for your enjoyment.": "谁可能对抗元素先知的力量？也许新的英雄们会浮出水面，寻找这些灾难的源头。来自于一个安静的鱼民种族，Locathah人确实对海浪在他们的家园附近发生的剧烈变化感到震惊。即使是现在，他们中的冠军们也在寻找答案，并使堕落之星之海对他们的人民再次安全。这场冒险包括使用locathah作为可玩的角色种族，在这里为你提供享受。",
	"Gar is most definitely evil, and his plans target other creatures and NPCs as victims in this scenario, despite the fact that they're also evil. Because of this, the NPCs who come to understand the threat that Gar poses to them and their interests see the characters as an opportunity to strike back at their diabolical host, and will cooperate to the best of their ability.": "加尔无疑是邪恶的，他的计划将其他生物和NPC作为这个场景的受害者，尽管他们也是邪恶的。正因为如此，那些了解到加尔对他们和他们的利益构成威胁的NPC将这些角色视为对他们邪恶的主人进行反击的机会，并会尽其所能进行合作。",
	"At the beginning of the adventure, set the scene by reading following boxed text aloud:": "在冒险开始时，通过大声朗读以下方框内的文字来设置场景。",
	"For the last few moon cycles, a war has waged among those who dwell above the waves. The lands called Turmish and Thay are at war. This conflict has become so violent and strange that it's even spread beneath the waves. Those from Thay summon foul undead beings to do their bidding, and even launched an assault on the sea elf city of Myth Nantar! Outrageous!": "在过去的几个月亮周期里，一场战争在那些居住在海浪之上的人之间展开了。被称为Turmish和Thay的土地正在交战。这场冲突已经变得如此暴力和奇怪，甚至蔓延到了海浪之下。那些来自泰伊的人召唤肮脏的不死生物来为他们服务，甚至对海精灵城市神话南塔发起了攻击！这让人难以置信。太离谱了!",
	"During these conflicts, each of you have assisted the Turmish in driving these foul undead creatures away, and in this endeavor you have experienced both glorious successes and dismal failures.": "在这些冲突中，你们每个人都协助图尔米什人赶走了这些肮脏的不死生物，在这一努力中，你们既经历了光荣的成功，也经历了惨痛的失败。",
	"Recently, the waters in a nearby area have grown swift and angry, and the skies above show no blue or beautiful bright light. Many ships from the surface have sunk in this 'darkening' and the coral has quickly grown to envelope the remains, so quickly as to no doubt be unnatural.": "最近，附近地区的水域变得湍急而愤怒，上方的天空没有显示出蓝色或美丽的亮光。许多来自海面的船只在这种 \"黑暗化 \"中沉没，珊瑚迅速生长，将遗体包裹起来，其速度之快，无疑是不自然的。",
	"The elders are worried, as the source of this strangeness remains unknown. The Turmish and Thayans are too busy with their conflicts to notice, and so it is up to you brave heroes to travel into the darkening and discover what evil has come to reside so near your shoals.": "长老们很担心，因为这种奇怪的东西的来源仍然不明。Turmish和Thayans正忙于他们的冲突而无暇顾及，因此，这就需要你们这些勇敢的英雄们前往黑暗中，发现什么邪恶的东西会在你们的海岸附近出现。",
	"Whether you're playing with the pregenerated characters or your players have created locathah heroes of their own (see \"{@adventure Appendix B: Locathah Characters|LR|3}\"), this is a great time for the players to introduce their characters and describe them to the group. Once they have completed their introductions, read or paraphrase the following boxed text:": "无论你是用预先生成的角色进行游戏，还是你的玩家自己创造了locathah英雄（见\"{@adventure Appendix B: Locathah Characters|LR|3}\"），这都是让玩家介绍他们的角色并向大家描述他们的好时机。一旦他们完成了介绍，请阅读或转述以下方框内的文字。",
	"After swimming for half the day, you see the \"darkening\" up ahead. It's difficult to see anything clearly within its borders, though you can vaguely make out the outline of a mountain of sunken ships resting on the sea floor, grown over with coral. No other creatures can be seen within the darkness, and the silence here is broken only by the turbulence of the water around you.": "在游了半天之后，你看到了前面的 \"黑化\"。在它的边界内很难看清楚任何东西，尽管你可以隐约看出一座沉船山的轮廓，它停在海底，上面长满了珊瑚。黑暗中看不到其他生物，只有你周围的水的动荡打破了这里的寂静。",
	"If the characters manage to somehow spot the sahuagin party, who do their best to remain at least one hundred feet away from them, the sahuagin immediately attack. Otherwise, they follow and watch from a distance, allowing the characters to spring any potential traps or hazards.": "如果角色们设法发现了萨瓦金人的队伍，而萨瓦金人尽力与他们保持至少100英尺的距离，那么萨瓦金人就会立即发动攻击。否则，他们就会跟在后面，在远处观察，让角色们跳出任何潜在的陷阱或危险。",
	"The presence of {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR} and the rift he opened (Umberlee's Maw) have created an area in the ocean that acts like a beacon for strong, irregular currents and bad weather. Underwater, the effect manifests as a general darkness in an oddly specific area, surrounding the coral mountain that encases the many sunken ships that recently met an untimely demise.": "{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}的存在和他打开的裂缝(Umberlee's Maw)在海洋中形成了一个区域，就像强烈的、不规则的海流和恶劣天气的灯塔。在水下，这种影响表现为一个奇怪的特定区域的普遍黑暗，围绕着珊瑚山，包裹着许多最近遭遇不幸的沉没的船只。",
	"The coral mountain, comprised of recently sunken ships covered by a crunchy coral shell, is referred to as Umberlee's Maw by {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}. Normally this would include his followers as well, but at the moment they consist of a pair of sea lions that are drawn to the divine power he possesses and the undead remains of those who lost their lives when their ships sunk.": "珊瑚山由最近沉没的船只组成，上面覆盖着松脆的珊瑚壳，被{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}称为Umberlee的巨口。通常这也包括他的追随者，但目前他们由一对被他所拥有的神力吸引的海狮和那些在船只沉没时失去生命的不死之身组成。",
	"When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.": "当进行近战武器攻击时，没有游泳速度的生物（无论是天生的还是魔法赋予的）在攻击卷上有劣势，除非武器是匕首、标枪、短剑、长矛或三叉戟。",
	"A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).": "远程武器的攻击会自动错过武器正常范围以外的目标。即使对正常范围内的目标，攻击卷也有劣势，除非该武器是弩、网或像标枪一样的武器（包括矛、三叉戟或飞镖）。",
	"Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.": "完全浸泡在水中的生物和物体对火灾伤害有抵抗力。",
	"This ship was the last one to sink before Gar caused the coral to grow up around the entire mass. As such, the forecastle protrudes from the coral, creating a passage in and out of Umberlee's Maw.": "这艘船是最后一艘沉没的船，之前加尔导致珊瑚在整个船体周围生长起来。因此，前甲板从珊瑚中伸出来，形成了一条进出昂布利大口的通道。",
	"The top deck of this protruding ship is completely exposed to the ravages of the open sea, though it tilts at a precarious forty-five degrees, with the aft end sunk deep into the surrounding coral. The masts have been completely torn off the ship.": "这艘突出的船的顶层甲板完全暴露在公海的蹂躏之下，尽管它以不稳定的四十五度倾斜，船尾深深沉入周围的珊瑚中。桅杆已经完全从船上扯了下来。",
	"There are three different ways to descend into the coral structure from this point. There is a gaping hole in the hull of the caravel at the fore that leads directly into the lower deck, and from there into Umberlee's Maw.": "从这里可以有三种不同的方式下到珊瑚结构中。在前部的船体上有一个缺口，可以直接进入下层甲板，并从那里进入翁贝里的大嘴。",
	"The characters can pass through the doors that would normally lead to the captain's cabin aft, to discover that the floor has collapsed there leaving a crude set of stairs as well as a gaping hole to swim through, also to the lower deck.": "人物可以通过通常通往船尾船长室的门，发现那里的地板已经坍塌，留下一套简陋的楼梯以及一个可以游泳的缺口，也是通往下层甲板。",
	"Lastly, the characters can attempt to smash their way through the metal grate affixed to the floor of the upper deck (AC 19, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage) that also leads directly to the lower deck. It hasn't been here long, so it has only just begun to corrode.": "最后，角色们可以尝试砸开贴在上层甲板地板上的金属栅栏（AC19，27点命中率，对毒药和精神伤害免疫），它也直接通向下层甲板。它在这里的时间并不长，所以它才刚刚开始腐蚀。",
	"Lastly, a character with a crowbar can attempt to pry the grate open with a successful DC 20 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. If multiple characters have crowbars, and want to work together, then one of them can make a single check at advantage, representing their combined efforts.": "最后，一个拥有撬棍的角色可以通过成功的DC20力量（{@skill Athletics}）检查来尝试撬开栅栏。如果多个角色都有撬棍，并且想一起工作，那么他们中的一个人可以以优势进行一次检定，代表他们的联合努力。",
	"As the characters descend into the lower decks of this ship, read or paraphrase the following boxed text:": "当人物下到这艘船的下层甲板时，阅读或转述以下方框内的文字。",
	"As you proceed belowdecks, it becomes much easier to swim as the hull protects you from the the strong currents outside. Many boxes and barrels are present here, somewhat waterlogged but largely intact.": "当你走到甲板下时，由于船体可以保护你不受外面强大水流的影响，游泳就变得容易多了。这里有许多箱子和木桶，虽然有些积水，但基本完好。",
	"This ship served as a tender vessel, bringing supplies to repair other warships as well as food, ale, medical supplies, and ammunition.": "这艘船作为一艘补给船，为维修其他战舰带来补给，以及食品、麦芽酒、医疗用品和弹药。",
	"The fresh foodstuffs, including fruits, vegetables, breads, and hardtack, have been destroyed by sea water. Heavily salted meats that have been cured are salvageable, as is the ale, whose barrels are coated in a thick layer of tar to keep water out. Additionally, there are twenty {@item Healer's Kit|PHB|healer's kits}, closed in small iron boxes sealed with wax, 200 ballista bolts, 1000 yards of sailcloth, 500 feet of uncut silk rope, and four kegs of resin.": "新鲜食品，包括水果、蔬菜、面包和硬面包，已经被海水破坏。经过腌制的重度盐渍肉是可以挽救的，麦芽酒也是如此，其酒桶上涂有一层厚厚的焦油，以防止水分进入。此外，还有20个{@item Healer's Kit|PHB|healer's kits}，封闭在用蜡密封的小铁盒里，200个弹弓螺栓，1000码的帆布，500英尺的未切割的丝绳，以及4桶树脂。",
	"If the characters haven't encountered the sahuagin lurking outside the coral mountain, these creatures take this opportunity, joining the battle at the end of the the second round in the hopes of overwhelming the party. The giant shark is too big to get into the lower decks, and so may be excluded from this combat if the entire party is below.": "如果角色们还没有遇到潜伏在珊瑚山外的萨瓦金，这些生物就会抓住这个机会，在第二轮结束时加入战斗，希望能压倒对方。巨鲨太大，无法进入下层甲板，因此如果整个队伍都在下面，可以排除在这场战斗之外。",
	"This area has the following features.": "这个地区有以下特点。",
	"The water here is still, though it slowly filters through the coral that encompasses this area.": "这里的水是静止的，尽管它慢慢地过滤了包括这个地区在内的珊瑚。",
	"There is no light here; the area that is heavily obscured. Characters without some kind of magical light or darkvision are considered blind. The encounter distance is reduced to 10 feet in these instances (see \"{@book Unusual Environments|DMG|5|Unusual Environments}\" in chapter 5 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}). For characters with a magical light source or darkvision, the water is considered to be clear.": "这里没有光线；被严重遮蔽的区域。没有某种神奇的光或暗视的角色被认为是盲人。在这些情况下，遭遇的距离会减少到10英尺（见《{@book Unusual Environments|DMG|5|Unusual Environments}》第五章的\"{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}\"）。对于有魔法光源或暗视的角色，水被认为是透明的。",

Thousands of humanoid corpses (humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, gnomes, and the odd half-orc) are neatly arranged in lines along the sea floor beneath the ceiling of the coral mountain, in some kind of macabre underwater morgue. Most of them are dressed in uniforms common among surface-dwellers traveling at sea.": "这个区域远远超出了你能看到的地方，延伸到黑暗中。数以千计的人形尸体（人类、精灵、矮人、半身人、地精，以及奇怪的半兽人）沿着珊瑚山天花板下的海底整齐地排列着，就像某种可怕的水下停尸房。他们中的大多数人都穿着在海上旅行的海面居民中常见的制服。",
	"When he arrived, {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR} arranged the corpses into orderly lines, so that he might prepare them for transition into one of the living dead. He completed a ritual using a small amount of blood he had obtained from a kraken, animating a handful of these creatures.": "当他到达时，{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}将尸体排列成有序的队伍，这样他就可以为他们过渡到活死人之一做准备。他用从克拉肯身上获得的少量血液完成了一个仪式，使这些生物中的一小部分变得生动起来。",
	"Since then, he's managed to dupe a pair of kraken priests into bringing a young kraken into the coral mountain, where they might \"nurture it into maturity in relative seclusion.\" Gar's intent, of course, is to use the blood from the young creature in a much larger ritual, to animate what will certainly be a terrifying army of undead to assault the coastline of the Sea of Fallen Stars.": "从那时起，他设法欺骗了一对海怪祭司，让他们把一只年轻的海怪带进了珊瑚山，在那里他们可以 \"在相对隐蔽的地方把它培育成成熟的海怪\"。当然，加尔的意图是在一个更大的仪式中使用这个年轻生物的血液，以激活肯定会是一支可怕的亡灵军队来攻击堕落星海的海岸线。",
	"If all of the corpses are thoroughly searched, they have a combined stash of 250 gp and 500 sp. Additionally, there are {@dice 1d10} pearls (worth 25 gp each) that adorn various earrings, necklaces, and the odd bellybutton piercing.": "此外，还有{@dice 1d10}珍珠(每颗价值25gp)，用来装饰各种耳环、项链和奇怪的肚脐穿孔。",

	"The coral creates a passageway here that leads directly to another sunken ship which is nearly enveloped by the surrounding coral. About five feet from the sandy ocean floor there's a sizeable hole, about fifteen feet in diameter, in its hull. A faint green light emanates from somewhere inside the lower decks of the ship.": "珊瑚在这里形成了一条通道，直接通向另一艘沉船，这艘船几乎被周围的珊瑚笼罩着。在距离沙质海底约五英尺的地方，船体上有一个相当大的洞，直径约15英尺。一道微弱的绿光从船的下层甲板的某个地方射出。",

Tiny fish that flash silver and green swim in schools, and algae, seaweed and other underwater plants grow in abundance, all lit by the soft green glow.": "在有灯光的地方，有大量的生命。各种颜色的海星在珊瑚上、在开口处、在船体内部生长。闪烁着银色和绿色的小鱼成群结队地游来游去，藻类、海草和其他水下植物大量生长，都被柔和的绿色光芒照亮。",
	"If any character peers directly into the hole, read or paraphrase the following boxed text:": "如果有任何人物直接向洞中窥视，请阅读或转述以下方框内的文字。",

The green light emanates directly from the creature's shell.": "绿光的来源很快变得明显。在离下层甲板尾部约10英尺处，一只大海龟，它的头和四肢被拉住，漂浮在后舱中间。绿光直接从该生物的壳中发出。",
	"This is {@creature Amble|LR}, a tortle druid who sought passage on this ship, and was on board when it sank. {@creature Amble|LR} was traveling to Turmish on the Sea of Fallen Stars, as they had heard of the war with Thay.

	" Accompanied by two {@creature Sea Lion|TftYP|sea lions} that he keeps as pets, {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR} resides in this underwater cave while he contemplates his next move and communes with Umberlee.": " 在两个作为宠物的{@creature Sea Lion|TftYP|sea lions}陪伴下，{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}居住在这个水下洞穴里，同时他在考虑他的下一步行动并与Umberlee交流。",
	"When the characters enter the chamber, read or paraphrase the following boxed text:": "当人物进入密室时，阅读或转述以下方框内的文字。",
	"Seated on a rough throne made of an odd arrangement of coral, bones, and barnacles, is a man whose right arm has been replaced entirely with a large metal claw, much like a crab's.": "坐在一个由珊瑚、骨头和藤壶的古怪排列组成的粗糙宝座上的是一个人，他的右臂已经完全被一个大的金属爪子取代，很像螃蟹的。",
	"His body is covered with clusters of barnacles, and in his left hand he idly grasps the haft of an exquisite trident, engraved with images of waves, shells, and sea creatures. On either side of the throne sit two massive creatures that are a strange hybrid of both fish and lion. They snarl in unison.": "他的身体上布满了成群的藤壶，他的左手闲闲地抓着一把精致的三叉戟的柄，上面刻着海浪、贝壳和海洋生物的图像。在宝座的两侧坐着两个巨大的生物，它们是鱼和狮子的奇怪混合体。它们齐声咆哮。",
	"Gar's power has grown by no small measure since he last encountered adventurers. Though he remains sullen and morose, he simultaneously projects an air of strength and confidence.": "自从上次遇到冒险家以来，加尔的力量有了不小的增长。虽然他仍然闷闷不乐，但他同时表现出一种力量和自信的气息。",
	"With the exception of anyone under the effect of a {@spell nondetection} spell, Gar is aware of every inhabitant within the coral mountain and has been tracking the characters' progress through his domain. While he doesn't know precisely what they've accomplished, outside of any creatures they might have killed or destroyed, he is ready for their arrival.": "除了受到{@spell nondetection}法术影响的人之外，加尔知道珊瑚山中的每一个居民，并且一直在跟踪这些人物在他的领域中的进展。虽然他不知道他们到底完成了什么，除了他们可能杀死或摧毁的任何生物之外，他已经准备好迎接他们的到来。",
	"After everyone has entered the chamber, Gar surreptitiously (but rapidly) grows the coral over the entrance, blocking them in. If anyone is hesitant to enter, he'll beckon for them to come forward, asking them to converse with him. In this regard, his demeanor is regal, but gracious and non-hostile.": "在所有人都进入密室后，加尔偷偷地（但迅速地）在入口处长出珊瑚，把他们挡在里面。如果有人对进入犹豫不决，他会招手让他们上前，要求他们与他交谈。在这方面，他的举止是威严的，但又是亲切的，没有敌意的。",
	"\"Please. Come forward that we might speak in a more companionable manner.\"": "\"请。请到前面来，我们可以用一种更友好的方式说话。\"",
	"With that, the man gestures with his left hand and the coral in the chamber grows a seat for each of you to perch upon, should you so desire.": "就这样，这个人用他的左手做了个手势，房间里的珊瑚长出了一个座位，供你们每个人栖息，如果你们愿意的话。",
	"\"It has been too long since I've had a good conversation. Though your arrival is unexpected, your presence is much desired nonetheless. How can I help you?\"": "\"我已经很久没有好好聊过天了。虽然你的到来是出乎意料的，但你的出现还是让人很期待。有什么可以帮助你的吗？\"",
	"If the characters are peaceful and speak with Gar, he's happy to hear them out, listening intently, with no show of defensiveness or remorse for any accusations they might direct his way. Nor does he offer an apology or reparations for damages they might describe.": "如果人物是和平的，并与加尔交谈，他很乐意听他们说，认真倾听，对他们可能指向他的任何指责没有任何防卫或悔恨的表现。他也不会为他们可能描述的损失提供道歉或赔偿。",
	"When they're done speaking, Gar will explain his newly found devotion to Umberlee, including his \"resurrection\" and newly discovered purpose. He'll even tell the characters what he plans to do, and how he plans to do it. While Gar doesn't gloat, he will speak of his intentions as though his success is inevitable.": "当他们讲完后，加尔会解释他新发现的对Umberlee的奉献，包括他的 \"复活 \"和新发现的目的。他甚至会告诉人物他打算做什么，以及他打算怎么做。虽然加尔并不幸灾乐祸，但他在谈到他的意图时，会认为他的成功是不可避免的。",
	"Once Gar has completely described his plans, he thanks the characters for listening to him, and disappears from the chamber.": "一旦加尔完全描述了他的计划，他就感谢这些人物听了他的话，然后从房间里消失了。",
	"If at any point the characters act in a manner unbecoming to a peaceful conversation (cast a spell, move to attack, attempt to circle to his flank or behind him, etc.) Gar sighs, and disappears from the chamber.": "如果在任何时候，人物的行为与和平对话不相称（施法、移动攻击、试图绕到他的侧翼或身后，等等），加尔就会叹气，并从会议室消失。",
	"At this point it is extremely important that you keep track of how many rounds it takes the characters to complete this combat, and exit the chamber. While they're in combat here, Gar has proceeded to the final encounter that begins with his assault on the kraken priests. See below for more details.": "在这一点上，极为重要的是，你要记下这些角色需要多少个回合才能完成这次战斗，并离开密室。当他们在这里战斗的时候，加尔已经进入了最后的遭遇战，开始了他对克拉肯祭司的攻击。更多细节见下文。",
	"When Gar leaves this area, the {@creature Sea Lion|TftYP|sea lions} attack the characters, and the entire room is flooded with magic that acts like an {@spell entangle} spell of massive proportions.": "当加尔离开这个区域时，{@creature Sea Lion|TftYP|sea lions}攻击人物，整个房间被魔法淹没，就像一个{@spell entangle}巨大的咒语。",
	"A character who successfully casts {@spell dispel magic} against a 6th level spell suppresses this effect for 1 minute.": "一个成功对六级法术施放{@spell dispel magic}的角色会在1分钟内抑制这个效果。",
	"To leave this chamber, the characters will have to cut their way out or move through the coral blocking the entrance. The coral covering the entrance has has AC 15, 40 hit points, immunity to psychic and poison damage, and resistance to piercing and slashing damage.": "要离开这个密室，角色们必须凿开他们的出路，或者穿过堵住入口的珊瑚。覆盖在入口处的珊瑚有15点攻击力，40点命中率，对精神和毒药伤害免疫，对穿刺和砍击伤害有抵抗力。",
	"It's possible to push through the coral, but doing so requires a successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. A creature who fails this saving throw takes {@dice 7d8} slashing damage, or half as much on a success. The wall is 5 feet thick and every 1 foot costs 5 feet of movement. Characters stuck in the wall are considered restrained until they push through, and are required to make the above Dexterity saving throw on their turn each round.": "有可能推开珊瑚，但这样做需要成功地进行DC18灵巧的蓄力。未能成功的生物会受到{@dice 7d8}的砍伤，如果成功则会受到一半的伤害。这堵墙有5英尺厚，每1英尺需要5英尺的移动距离。卡在墙里的角色被认为是被限制的，直到他们推开，并且需要在他们每回合的回合中进行上述灵巧的救赎。",
	"Now is the time for the characters, and any allies they've managed to acquire, to face off against {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR} and his drowned minions. Time is of the essence and events progress while the characters are attempting to free themselves from area 13, so it's best to keep track of the number of rounds it takes for the characters to break through the coral and find their way back to area 5 to confront Gar. It might take them a few rounds to find out where he is, as he gave no indication as to where he was going when he disappeared.": "现在是人物和他们设法获得的任何盟友与{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}和他的溺水的爪牙对峙的时候了。时间是最重要的，在人物试图从13区解救出来的时候，事件也在进展，所以最好是记录下人物突破珊瑚并找到回到5区与加尔对峙所需的回合数。他们可能要花几轮时间才能找到他的下落，因为他失踪时没有说明他要去哪里。",
	"If {@creature Amble|LR} has joined the characters, the tortle remains a steadfast ally in the fight to come. {@creature Amble|LR} will focus any attacks on the drowned, leaving Gar to the characters. If things get tough, {@creature Amble|LR} can also act as a backup healer for the party. Note that dealing damage to Gar does not break {@creature Amble|LR}'s rule, as the tortle believes that Gar is some kind of aberrant being. Because of this, {@creature Amble|LR} will not intercede when the characters attack Gar.": "如果{@creature Amble|LR}已经加入了角色，那么在接下来的战斗中，托尔仍然是坚定的盟友。{@creature Amble|LR}会集中攻击被淹死的人，把加尔留给角色。如果事情变得棘手，{@creature Amble|LR}也可以作为队伍的后备治疗者。注意，对加尔造成伤害并不违反{@creature Amble|LR}的规则，因为托尔认为加尔是某种反常的存在。正因为如此，当人物攻击加尔时，{@creature Amble|LR}不会进行干预。",
	"While they've been voted \"most likely to die before the characters even show up,\" the manner of their demise may depend on whether the characters managed to befriend them. Below are a number of possibilities.": "虽然他们被评为 \"最可能在人物出现之前死亡\"，但他们死亡的方式可能取决于人物是否设法与他们交好。以下是一些可能性。",
	"Perhaps the characters killed {@creature Fhenimore|LR} and {@creature Whymsee|LR} without being consumed by the {@creature young kraken|LR}, or the characters failed to negotiate with them and were driven from the area, or the characters simply never visited this area of the coral mountain.": "也许人物杀死了{@creature Fhenimore|LR}和{@creature Whymsee|LR}而没有被{@creature young kraken|LR}所吞噬，或者人物未能与它们谈判而被赶出该地区，或者人物根本没有到过珊瑚山的这个地区。",
	"This scenario also works even if the characters did befriend the kraken priests, but never learned of Gar's plan to use the kraken's blood—or if they did learn his plan, but never told {@creature Fhenimore|LR} and {@creature Whymsee|LR} about it.": "即使人物确实与海怪祭司交好，但从未得知加尔使用海怪之血的计划，或者他们确实得知了加尔的计划，但从未告诉{@creature Fhenimore|LR}和{@creature Whymsee|LR}这件事，这种情况也适用。",
	"Regardless of the reason, the kraken priests are not alarmed or on guard when {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR} arrives. In this instance, Gar's plans unfold as shown in the \"Killing {@creature Fhenimore|LR} and {@creature Whymsee|LR}\" sidebar.": "不管是什么原因，当{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}到达时，克拉肯祭司们并没有被惊动或戒备。在这种情况下，加尔的计划如 \"杀死{@creature Fhenimore|LR}和{@creature Whymsee|LR} \"侧边栏所示展开。",
	"Not suspecting treachery, the kraken priests aren't prepared when Gar casts {@spell charm person} as a 2nd level spell, charming them both.": "由于没有怀疑背叛，当加尔施展{@spell charm person}的二阶法术，迷住他们两个时，克拉肯祭司没有准备。",
	"Gar and the two priests swim to {@area area 6|024|x}, outside the range of the young kraken's telepathy.": "加尔和两个牧师游到{@area area 6|024|x}，在年轻克拉肯的心灵感应范围之外。",
	"Gar swims back.": "加尔游了回来。",
	"Gar surprises the {@creature Young Kraken|LR|kraken}, hitting it twice with {@item Wave} before the creature can react, and achieving a critical hit both times. The kraken is slain, and Gar begins the process of drawing blood from the creature, storing it in massive five-gallon bladders he brought along for this purpose.": "加尔让{@creature Young Kraken|LR|kraken}大吃一惊，在它反应过来之前，用{@item Wave}击中了它两次，而且两次都是关键一击。海怪被杀死了，加尔开始从这个生物身上抽血，并将其储存在他为此带来的巨大的五加仑水囊中。",
	"In this scenario, the characters have befriended the kraken priests, learned of Gar's plans from either the map in {@area area 7|026|x} or from {@creature Shoalar Quanderil|LR}, and have convinced the kraken priests that Gar means to kill their charge. {@creature Fhenimore|LR} and {@creature Whymsee|LR} are on alert when Gar arrives, and things play out very differently. In this instance, Gar's plans unfold as shown in the \"Fighting {@creature Fhenimore|LR} and {@creature Whymsee|LR}\" sidebar.": "在这个场景中，人物已经与海怪祭司交好，从{@area area 7|026|x}的地图或{@creature Shoalar Quanderil|LR}的地图上了解到加尔的计划，并使海怪祭司相信加尔是要杀死他们的负责人。当加尔到达时，{@creature Fhenimore|LR}和{@creature Whymsee|LR}正处于警戒状态，而事情的发展却非常不同。在这种情况下，加尔的计划如 \"与{@creature Fhenimore|LR}和{@creature Whymsee|LR}战斗 \"侧边栏所示展开。",
	"Gar activates the {@item cube of force} function on {@item Wave}, so that living creatures may not harm approach him. {@creature Fhenimore|LR} and {@creature Whymsee|LR} will both cast lightning bolt on Gar, who will succeed at on only one saving throw only, but then use his Legendary Resistance feature to save on the other. Gar takes 28 hit points lightning damage.": "加尔在{@item Wave}上启动{@item cube of force}功能，使生物不能伤害他。{@creature Fhenimore|LR}和{@creature Whymsee|LR}都会对加尔施放闪电，加尔只有一次救赎成功，但另一次会使用他的传奇抵抗功能进行救赎。加尔受到28点闪电伤害。",
	"Gar casts {@spell conjure animals} as a 7th level spell, summoning six {@creature Swarm of Quippers||swarms of quippers} and directing them to slay and consume the kraken priests.": "加尔施展{@spell conjure animals}作为七级法术，召唤出六个{@creature Swarm of Quippers||swarms of quippers}并指挥它们杀死和吞噬克拉肯祭司。",
	"Gar casts {@spell freedom of movement}, escaping the grapple, and then uses a legendary action to attack the creature. He will score a critical hit, slaying the kraken.": "加尔施展{@spell freedom of movement}，逃脱了抓捕，然后使用一个传奇动作来攻击这个生物。他将取得关键一击，杀死卡拉基。",
	"If the characters met Shoalar and allied with the devotee of Olhydra, Shoalar accompanies them from his lair to {@area area 13|041|x}, bringing the two {@creature Water Elemental Myrmidon|MTF|water elemental myrmidons} with him. This makes the fight in that area easier and may allow the characters to interrupt Gar in the actions described above.": "如果角色遇到肖拉并与奥海德拉的信徒结盟，肖拉就会从他的巢穴陪同他们到{@area area 13|041|x}，把两个{@creature Water Elemental Myrmidon|MTF|water elemental myrmidons}的人带上。这使得该地区的战斗更加容易，并可能让人物在上述行动中打断加尔。",
	"Otherwise, if Shoalar is dead or simply hasn't encountered the characters, neither he nor his elementals will be present at this fight.": "否则，如果肖拉已经死了或者根本没有遇到这些人物，那么他和他的元素都不会出现在这场战斗中。",
	"Each round after the young kraken is slain, Gar can harvest five gallons of blood from the creature. It takes another two rounds for him to switch from a full bladder to an empty one, so for twenty bladders it will take Gar a total of 60 rounds (6 minutes) to complete his work with the kraken's corpse. He'll only need ten bladders of blood to animate the corpses present in the coral mountain, but he hopes to perform the ritual again at a later date.": "在年轻的克拉肯被杀后的每一回合，加尔都可以从这个生物身上收获五加仑的血。他还需要两轮时间才能从一个满的膀胱切换到一个空的膀胱，因此对于20个膀胱来说，加尔总共需要60轮（6分钟）才能完成他对克拉肯尸体的工作。他只需要10个血囊就能使珊瑚山中存在的尸体复活，但他希望在以后的日子里再次进行这个仪式。",
	"The state they find Gar in, as well as what resources he has to fight them with, depends largely on when the characters arrive and who their allies are (or were). In any case, it's safe to say that Gar will open combat with his Umberlee's Wake ability, catching as many characters and allies in its massive area as he can. In addition to the impressive assortment of powers and abilities listed in his stat block, Gar can employ lair actions (see the \"Lair Actions\" sidebar) while he's within the coral mountain.": "他们发现加尔处于什么状态，以及他有什么资源来对付他们，很大程度上取决于这些人物何时到达，以及他们的盟友是谁（或曾经是谁）。在任何情况下，可以肯定地说，加尔会以他的Umberlee's Wake能力开启战斗，在其巨大的区域内尽可能多地抓捕角色和盟友。除了他的状态块中列出的各种令人印象深刻的力量和能力外，加尔在珊瑚山中时还可以使用巢穴行动（见 \"巢穴行动 \"侧边栏）。",
	"Gar may teleport anywhere within the coral mountain, bringing up to five willing creatures with him.": "加尔可以传送到珊瑚山的任何地方，最多可以带着五个愿意的生物一起传送。",
	"Win or lose, this is a tough encounter, one that the characters may very well be forced to flee from. If the characters do run from Gar, he completes the ritual to animate an army of the drowned, fortifies his position at the coral mountain further, and begins a campaign of terror across the coastal settlements of the Sea of Fallen Stars.": "无论输赢，这都是一场艰难的遭遇战，角色们很可能被迫逃离。如果角色们真的逃离了加尔，他就会完成仪式，使溺水者的军队复活，进一步巩固他在珊瑚山的位置，并开始在堕落之星之海的沿海定居点进行恐怖活动。",
	"Gar is aware of Thay's power with regards to the undead, so he isn't so foolish as to challenge them with this army. Though, he might be open to an alliance with the Red Wizards that could benefit them both.": "加尔知道泰伊在亡灵方面的力量，所以他还没有愚蠢到用这支军队来挑战他们。不过，他可能对与红袍巫师的联盟持开放态度，这对他们双方都有利。",
	"If this happens, the characters are victorious! They could, with no small amount of cleanup, to turn the coral mountain into a beautifully misshapen but habitable home for many locathah who have been displaced by recent attacks and other conflicts.": "如果这种情况发生了，人物就胜利了！他们可以通过不小的清理，把珊瑚山变成美丽的错落有致但适合居住的家园，让许多Locathah人在最近的攻击和其他冲突中流离失所。他们可以通过不小的清理工作，将珊瑚山变成一个美丽的错落有致但适合许多因最近的袭击和其他冲突而流离失所的locathah的家。",
	"Accomplishing this would not only cement the characters' status as heroes, but elevate them to a position of prestige as potential future leaders of the locathah tribes. The details of their acclaim are up to you, though it is entirely possible—likely even—that Gar will someday return to take his revenge.": "完成这个任务不仅可以巩固人物的英雄地位，还可以提升他们的声望，使他们成为locathah部落未来的潜在领袖。他们获得赞誉的细节由你决定，尽管加尔有一天会回来报仇，这是完全可能的，甚至是很可能的。",
	"This appendix details creatures that are encountered in this adventure.": "本附录详细介绍了本次冒险中遇到的生物。",
