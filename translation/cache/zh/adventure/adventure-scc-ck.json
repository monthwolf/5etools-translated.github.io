	"In this adventure, the characters explore campus as first-year students. They'll navigate orientation at the Biblioplex and settle into social life in rowdy gathering spots. They'll get roped into a thrilling dare. They'll watch—and maybe even take part in—an outdoor play and discover something jarring in a marsh adjacent to the campus. And along the way, hints of something sinister emerge. Danger crops up in the most unassuming places, and the characters must rise to the occasion. Will they become campus heroes? Or will these kerfuffles explode into something that threatens all of Strixhaven?": "在这次冒险中，角色们将作为一年级学生探索校园。他们将在图书馆的迎新活动中穿梭，并在喧闹的聚会场所融入社会生活。他们会被卷入一场惊心动魄的冒险。他们将观看，甚至可能参与户外表演，并在校园附近的沼泽地发现一些令人震惊的东西。在这一过程中，出现了一些险恶的暗示。危险出现在最不起眼的地方，而这些人物必须迎难而上。他们会成为校园英雄吗？或者这些争吵会爆发出威胁到整个Strixhaven的东西？",

	"The strange happenings on campus in this adventure are caused by a corrupted substance known as eldritch balm. Used at Strixhaven for decades, eldritch balm is an alchemical salve made from the sludgy, acidic waters of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses the Witherbloom College campus. Once these waters undergo an alchemical process in Witherbloom's faculty laboratories, the resulting eldritch balm is used to magically treat and strengthen objects, from storage trunks to cooking vats to stage props and more. The balm's effects differ depending on the objects treated, but it typically provides resistance to certain types of damage or other protections useful on a campus where magic often goes awry.": "在这次冒险中，校园里发生的怪事是由一种被称为eldritch balm的腐败物质引起的。eldritch balm在Strixhaven使用了几十年，是一种炼金术药膏，由Sedgemoor的淤泥和酸性水制成，Sedgemoor是包括Witherbloom学院校园的河口。一旦这些水在威瑟布洛姆学院的实验室里经历了炼金过程，产生的长生不老药膏就会被用来神奇地治疗和强化物体，从储藏箱到烹饪桶到舞台道具等等。膏药的效果因处理的物体而异，但它通常提供对某些类型的损害的抵抗力或其他保护，在一个魔法经常出错的校园里很有用。",
	"Unknown to anyone on campus, Sedgemoor's waters were recently corrupted by the foul magic practiced by {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} Grenshel, the villain the characters ultimately confront in {@adventure chapter 6|SCC-ARiR|0}. {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} intended the eldritch balm to be affected by his sinister experiments and hoped the resulting chaos would disrupt life at Strixhaven.": "校园里的人都不知道，塞奇摩尔的水最近被{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}Grenshel施展的邪恶魔法腐蚀了，Grenshel是{@adventure chapter 6|SCC-ARiR|0}中人物最终面对的恶棍。{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}打算让长生不老药受到他邪恶实验的影响，并希望由此产生的混乱能扰乱斯特里克斯海文的生活。",

He is a good friend to Javenesh Stoutclaw, and anyone who puts the owlin in danger must answer to Tulk.": "酒馆的经理也一直关注着这个区域。Tulk \"The Bulk\" Tusktooth（合法的好兽人{@creature gladiator}）是Strixhaven的雇员，举止和善，但不能容忍不当行为。图尔克的绰号来自于他强壮的身体，他身高近七英尺，肌肉发达--尽管他温暖的笑容和他标志性的金色耳环一样闪闪发光。他是杰文尼斯-斯图特克劳的好朋友，任何让猫头鹰陷入危险的人都必须向图尔克负责。",

The chef hires all student cooks, so characters who wish to work in the kitchen must approach her directly.": "库尔蒂以她的教诲为生（据说她的烹饪作品还带有一点魔力），因此她和她的学徒们做的两道菜都不一样。厨师标志性的喊声：\"要辣！\"和 \"需要更多的爱！\"经常从厨房里回荡到溢出的座位区。主厨雇用所有的学生厨师，所以希望在厨房工作的人必须直接与她联系。",

Horrid masses of summoned skittering bugs suddenly pour out of bags and boxes of ingredients in the food prep areas, just as other students storm into the kitchen behind the characters. While the characters take on the more dangerous mephits, describe their friends and fellow students working in the background alongside them to help clear the bugs out of the kitchen. As soon as the mephits are dispatched, the magic flaring up in the kitchen fades.": "人物一出现，敌对的梅菲特就开始攻击，但它们并不是厨房里唯一的威胁。可怕的大量被召唤出来的闪电虫突然从食物准备区的袋子和盒子里涌出来，就在其他学生冲进人物身后的厨房时。当角色们对付更危险的Mephits时，描述他们的朋友和同学们在后台与他们一起工作，帮助把虫子从厨房里清除出去。一旦梅菲特被赶走，厨房里的魔法就会消失。",
	"If all the characters fall {@condition unconscious} during the fight, Tulk shows up at the start of the next round and dispatches the mephits. Tulk has two {@item Potion of Healing||potions of healing} stored behind the servers' station, and he offers them to any injured characters. If the discussion turns to what happened, Tulk explains that sometimes Curtie's culinary experiments go awry, so such chaos in the kitchen isn't unheard of.

	"Once the mephits are dispatched, a successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check reveals the same oily black substance on the cauldrons that the characters might have seen belched out by the frogs before the Firejolt Café race and found on the trunk during orientation.

	"She explains eldritch balm to the characters and says she believes it's likely that the Sedgemoor waters used to brew the latest batch of eldritch balm were corrupted in some way. She doesn't necessarily suspect foul play but mentions that, in the past, students have been caught practicing forbidden magic in the more remote parts of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses Witherbloom College's campus. Such sinister magic might be responsible for the balm's corruption, but a random surge of wild magic is an equally likely explanation in her mind. In any case, this corruption must have caused objects treated with the eldritch balm and creatures that came into contact with it to take on temporary—and dangerous—magical properties.": "她向这些人物解释了长生不老药，并说她相信很可能是用来酿造最新一批长生不老药的塞奇摩尔水被某种方式腐蚀了。她不一定怀疑是犯规，但她提到，在过去，有学生在塞奇摩尔更偏远的地方练习禁忌的魔法，也就是包括威瑟布洛姆学院校园的河口，被抓到。这种阴险的魔法可能是造成香膏腐败的原因，但在她看来，随机涌现的野生魔法也是同样可能的解释。在任何情况下，这种腐败一定会导致用长生不老药膏处理过的物体和与之接触的生物具有暂时的、危险的魔法特性。",
	"Professor Totsky gives the characters a {@item Holy Water (flask)|PHB|flask of holy water} and explains that pouring it into the underwater spring whose waters are used to create eldritch balm will settle the waters and prevent further corruption. She describes the location of the spring ({@adventure area S7|SCC-CK|0|S7. Underwater Spring} on {@adventure map 3.6|SCC-CK|0|Map 3.6: sedgemoor}) to help the characters find it. She urges the characters to take on this task so she can immediately track down the rest of the contaminated balm and remove it from objects on campus.": "托茨基教授给了角色们一个{@item Holy Water (flask)|PHB|flask of holy water}，并解释说把它倒入水下的泉水中，泉水被用来制造长生不老药，可以使泉水沉淀，防止进一步腐败。她描述了泉水的位置（{@adventure area S7|SCC-CK|0|S7. Underwater Spring} on {@adventure map 3.6|SCC-CK|0|Map 3.6: sedgemoor}），以帮助人物找到它。她敦促角色们接受这个任务，这样她就可以立即追踪其余被污染的香膏，并将其从校园里的物体上清除。",
	"The day after the incident at the Rose Stage Festival, the characters are scheduled to collect spell components from Sedgemoor and bring those samples back to Professor Lang, who teaches their Magical Physiologies course. This gives them a convenient opportunity to investigate that area on behalf of Professor Totsky.": "在玫瑰舞台节事件的第二天，这些人物被安排从塞奇摩尔收集法术组件，并将这些样本带回给教他们魔法生理学课程的兰教授。这给了他们一个方便的机会，代表托茨基教授去调查那个地区。",
	"The characters know that they must pour the flask of holy water given to them by Professor Totsky into an underwater spring somewhere in area S7. Doing so should prevent future flare-ups of the wild magic that tainted the eldritch balm behind all the strange campus mishaps.

Underwater Spring}.": "角色们知道他们必须把托茨基教授给他们的那瓶圣水倒入S7地区的某个水下泉眼。这样做应该可以防止未来野生魔法的爆发，这些魔法玷污了所有奇怪的校园事故背后的长生不老药膏。此外，他们可以在{@adventure area S7|SCC-CK|0|S7.

	"Your expedition has brought you to one of the more dismal parts of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses the Witherbloom campus. Muddy swamp water flows between raised islets covered with fungi and foliage. Large tree stumps jut out of the water in random places. A pair of rickety wooden docks and two wooden huts are the only indication that people ever come here.": "你们的考察把你们带到了赛德摩尔一个更令人沮丧的地方，那就是包括威瑟布洛姆校园的河口。泥泞的沼泽水在覆盖着真菌和树叶的凸起小岛之间流动。大树桩随意地从水中伸出来。一对摇摇欲坠的木制码头和两个木制小屋是人们曾经来到这里的唯一迹象。",

	"The journal belonged to the evil {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}; it slipped out of his pocket while he practiced the corrupting magic that caused this academic year's mishaps.
