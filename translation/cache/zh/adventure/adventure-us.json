	"An elder warlock from the goblinoid swamp village of Urzin has been kidnapped by soldiers of the Dwendalian Empire. Now the machinations of an evil imperial inquisitor might unleash an evil that could threaten the garrison at Fort Venture and the goblinoids of Urzin alike. \"Unwelcome Spirits\" is a Wildemount adventure that takes characters from 1st to 3rd level, and which introduces them to Wildemount's desolate and foreboding Eastern Wynandir region.": "乌尔津妖精沼泽村的一位长老术士被德文达尔帝国的士兵绑架了。现在，一个邪恶的帝国审问者的阴谋可能会释放出一种邪恶，可能会威胁到风险堡垒的驻军和Urzin的妖精们。\"不受欢迎的灵魂 \"是荒野山庄的一次冒险，需要1到3级的角色，并向他们介绍荒野山庄荒凉和不祥的东温南迪尔地区。",
	"If your players are using the heroic chronicle to create their characters (see {@book chapter 4|EGW|5|Heroic Chronicle}), you can talk with them about creating characters with ties to Urzin or nearby Xhorhasian settlements. Alternatively, characters from elsewhere might be traveling to Urzin, whether individually or as a group. Since this adventure ties directly to the Kryn Dynasty's conflict with the Dwendalian Empire, you can also ask each player to consider their character's stance on the war and how the war might tie into their background.": "如果你的玩家使用英雄编年史来创建他们的角色（见{@book chapter 4|EGW|5|Heroic Chronicle}），你可以和他们讨论创建与乌尔钦或附近的Xhorhasian定居点有关系的角色。另外，来自其他地方的角色可能会前往乌尔钦，无论是个人还是团体。由于这次冒险直接关系到克莱恩王朝与德文达尔帝国的冲突，你也可以要求每个玩家考虑他们的角色对战争的立场，以及战争可能与他们的背景有关。",
	"What neither the imperial forces nor the goblinoids of Urzin know is that Bol'bara was performing a series of rare communal rites near a site of major arcane significance. With those rites interrupted, she is now in the throes of possession by her patron, a shadow demon known as Trush. If its dark power is set free, Trush could wreak havoc across the wastes of Xhorhas, using Bol'bara as its worldly vessel.": "帝国军队和乌尔钦的妖精们都不知道的是，博尔巴拉正在一个具有重大奥秘意义的地点附近进行一系列罕见的公共仪式。由于这些仪式被打断，她现在正处于被她的守护者--一个被称为Trush的影子恶魔--占有的痛苦之中。如果它的黑暗力量被释放出来，特鲁什可能会在Xhorhas的荒野上造成破坏，把博尔巴拉作为它的世界容器。",
	"At Buhfal's behest, the characters must chart a course to the Brokenveil Bluffs with the help of a hobgoblin guide, locate Fort Venture, and extract Bol'bara. Unfortunately, the reckless aims of the imperial inquisitor Parson Pellinost and his lackeys work to undermine their efforts. Without a timely interruption, the torturous interrogation of Bol'bara will lead to her possession by Trush, her shadow demon patron—and to a series of calamitous arcane events. Trush's demonic rampage will start at Fort Venture before wending its way back to Urzin—and it's up to the adventurers to do something about it.": "在Buhfal的要求下，这些人物必须在一个妖精向导的帮助下制定一条前往Brokenveil Bluffs的路线，找到Fort Venture，并救出Bol'bara。不幸的是，帝国审讯官帕森-佩里诺斯特（Pellinost）和他的走狗们鲁莽的目标破坏了他们的努力。如果不及时打断，对Bol'bara的折磨性审讯将导致她被她的影子恶魔守护者Trush占有，并导致一系列灾难性的神秘事件。特鲁什的恶魔暴行将从风险堡垒开始，然后蜿蜒回到乌尔钦，而冒险者们要做的就是对此采取行动。",
	"This is also a good time to figure out if the characters already know each other or if this adventure is the first time they've met. If none of the characters are goblinoids, they most likely already make up an adventuring party and have traveled to Urzin together.": "这也是一个很好的时间来弄清楚这些角色是否已经认识对方，或者这次冒险是他们第一次见面。如果没有一个角色是地精，那么他们很可能已经组成了一个冒险队伍，并且一起去了乌尔钦。",
	"The tone of the adventure and the read-aloud text assumes that the characters find Urzin a strange and exotic location. If the party consists of some or all goblinoids or other natives of Urzin, adjust the flavor and the read-aloud text accordingly.": "冒险的基调和朗读的文字都假设人物认为乌尔钦是一个奇怪的异域地点。如果一行人中有部分或全部是地精或其他乌尔钦的土著，请相应地调整味道和朗读文本。",
	"Once the players are ready to begin, read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:": "一旦玩家准备好开始，就读或转述以下内容来设定场景。",
	"The rank odors of the Brokenveil Marsh mingle with the musty aroma of a fleet of gargantuan reptiles as you traverse the rickety rope bridges above Urzin. This strange goblinoid village moves slowly and endlessly through the swampy Xhorhasian wastes, its structures set atop the massive shells of horizonback tortoises. Urzin's monstrous residents pay you little heed until you approach the large, ramshackle hall of Ogre Lord Buhfal II—a towering structure of haphazard timber and scrap.": "当你穿越乌尔津上空摇摇欲坠的绳索桥时，断壁沼泽的高级气味与巨大的爬行动物舰队的霉味混合在一起。这个奇怪的妖精村在沼泽的霍哈斯荒原上缓慢而无休止地移动，它的结构设置在地平线龟的巨大龟壳之上。乌尔津的怪物居民对你不屑一顾，直到你走近食人魔领主布法尔二世的大型破烂大厅--一个由杂乱无章的木材和废品组成的高耸结构。",
	"If the characters enter the hall of Ogre Lord Buhfal II, add the following:": "如果人物进入食人魔领主布法尔二世的大厅，请添加以下内容。",
	"The din of the swamp and the hushed chatter of Urzin's residents is muted as you step through the folds of a heavy leather curtain into the chamber beyond. There, the reek of the marsh is quickly replaced by the favorable scent of roasted meats and spiced wine. Orc attendants gesture you toward a litter of dingy furs before the seat of Buhfal II, who allows you to settle in before his baritone voice issues a welcome.": "当你穿过厚重的皮革帘子的褶皱，进入外面的房间时，沼泽地的喧嚣和乌尔钦居民沙哑的交谈声被压制了。在那里，沼泽的恶臭很快就被烤肉和香料酒的好闻气味所取代。兽人侍从向你打手势，示意你到布法尔二世的座位前坐下，他允许你在他的男中音发出的欢迎声中坐下。",
	"\"Eat. Drink. But be wary, for the empire has come to Xhorhas, bringing damnation with it!\"": "\"吃。喝吧。但要警惕，因为帝国已经来到了Xhorhas，带来了诅咒！\"",
	"{@creature Ogre Lord Buhfal II|EGW}—a lawful evil, male {@creature ogre} with an Intelligence score of 10—explains the current situation to the characters:": "{@creature Ogre Lord Buhfal II|EGW}--一个合法的邪恶，男性{@creature ogre}，智力值为10--向人物解释目前的情况。",
	"Since his father was slain forty years earlier by the Kryn paragon Sunbreaker Olomon, Buhfal II has seen a slow swell of discontent among Urzin's goblinoid population, who labor tirelessly to execute the Kryn Dynasty's clandestine agendas. An increasing number of Urzin's residents look to Buhfal and his advisors for leadership, despite the dynasty's overt hold on the area.": "自从他的父亲在四十年前被克莱恩的典范破日者奥洛蒙杀死后，布法尔二世看到乌尔津的地精人口中慢慢涌现出不满的情绪，他们不知疲倦地执行克莱恩王朝的秘密议程。越来越多的乌尔津居民期待布法尔和他的顾问们的领导，尽管王朝对该地区有明显的控制。",
	"Buhfal doesn't know what happened to her, but he knows that Dwendalian Empire patrols had been spotted in the area in previous weeks. The patrols strike out from an outpost known as Fort Venture, which watches over the Brokenveil Bluffs.": "布法尔不知道她发生了什么事，但他知道前几周在该地区发现了德温达利安帝国的巡逻队。巡逻队从一个被称为 \"风险堡垒 \"的前哨站出击，该堡垒监视着断肠崖。",
	"An elder villager who remembers the reign of the first Buhfal, Bol'bara is Urzin's chief loremaster and a pivotal ally in both the ongoing battle against the empire and the enduring struggle against the cruel environs of the Xhorhasian swamps. Little is known of Bol'bara's otherworldly patron, but her warlock powers are respected by all.": "Bol'bara是一位年长的村民，他记得第一个Buhfal的统治，他是Urzin的首席理论家，在与帝国的持续战斗和与Xhorhasian沼泽地的残酷环境的持久斗争中都是一个关键的盟友。人们对波尔巴拉的另一个世界的守护者知之甚少，但她的术士能力受到所有人的尊重。",
	"Without Bol'bara's arcane protections and political guile, Buhfal fears his people will grow submissive to the Kryn Dynasty's whims, making Urzin a more notable target for imperial reprisals.": "没有Bol'bara的神秘保护和政治诡计，Buhfal担心他的人民会越来越顺从克林王朝的想法，使Urzin成为帝国报复的更显著目标。",
	"{@creature Ogre Lord Buhfal II|EGW|Buhfal} hires the characters to locate the goblin warlock and retrieve her. For rescuing {@creature Bol'bara|EGW} from her kidnappers, the ogre lord agrees to pay 200 gp and to provide the characters with \"premium weapons.\"": "{@creature Ogre Lord Buhfal II|EGW|Buhfal}雇佣角色去寻找地精术士并救回她。为了从绑匪手中救出（1%），食人魔领主同意支付200金币，并为人物提供 \"高级武器\"。",
	"As they make preparations, the characters discover that the \"premium weapons\" Lord Buhfal promises are anything but. Each character receives their choice of any simple melee weapon from {@table weapons|phb|chapter 5} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, but these are crude weapons of goblinoid design. With resources scarce in Urzin, goblinoid-made weapons are often hastily crafted and cheap.": "当他们做准备时，角色们发现布法尔勋爵承诺的 \"高级武器 \"并不是什么。每个角色都可以从{@table weapons|phb|chapter 5}的{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中选择任何简单的近战武器，但这些都是地精设计的粗糙武器。由于乌尔钦的资源匮乏，地精制造的武器往往是仓促制作的，而且价格低廉。",
	"Characters looking for better gear can equip themselves (at normal prices) for the journey through Brokenveil Marsh by visiting one of Urzin's merchants. Popular stops in the village include the following:": "寻找更好的装备的角色可以通过拜访Urzin的一个商人来装备自己（以正常的价格），以便穿越Brokenveil沼泽。村子里受欢迎的地方包括以下几家。",

	"Any character not used to this environment who takes a short or long rest within the swamp without being on raised dry ground must make a DC 11 Constitution check. On a failure, the character contracts sewer plague (see \"{@book Diseases|DMG|8|Diseases}\" in chapter 8 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}).": "任何不习惯这种环境的角色，如果在沼泽地内进行短期或长期的休息而不在高处的干地上，必须进行DC11宪法检查。如果失败，该角色将感染下水道瘟疫（见《{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}》第8章的\"{@book Diseases|DMG|8|Diseases}\"）。",
	"Have the players designate one party member as the navigator. The navigator might be an NPC, such as Morgid the hobgoblin or some other guide, and the party can switch its navigator day to day.": "让玩家指定一名党员作为导航员。领航员可以是一个NPC，比如妖精莫吉德（Morgid）或其他向导，党派可以每天更换其领航员。",
	"At the start of each new travel day, the DM makes a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check on behalf of the navigator. This check determines whether or not the party becomes lost over the course of the day. Apply a +5 bonus to the check if the group sets a slow pace for the day, or a −5 penalty if the group is moving at a fast pace. It's possible to get lost on a river by following a tributary instead of the main branch.": "在每个新的旅行日开始时，DM代表领航员进行DC 15智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查。这个检定决定了队伍在这一天中是否会迷路。如果队伍设定了一天的慢节奏，则对该检查施加+5的奖励；如果队伍以快节奏行进，则施加-5的惩罚。沿着支流而不是主支流在河上迷路是有可能的。",
	"If the check succeeds, the navigator knows exactly where the party is on the players' map of Brokenveil Marsh throughout the day.": "如果检查成功，领航员就能准确地知道党在玩家的断肠沼泽地图上全天的位置。",
	"If the check fails, the party becomes lost. Each hex on the map is surrounded by six other hexes; whenever a lost party moves 1 hex, roll a {@dice d6} to randomly determine which neighboring hex the party enters, and don't divulge the party's location to the players. While the party is lost, players can't pinpoint the group's location on their map of Brokenveil Marsh. The next time a navigator succeeds on a Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check made to navigate, reveal the party's actual location to the players.": "如果检查失败，该队伍就会迷失。地图上的每个六边形都被其他六个六边形所包围；每当迷路的队伍移动了一个六边形，就掷一个{@dice d6}来随机决定队伍进入哪个邻近的六边形，并且不要把队伍的位置泄露给玩家。当队伍迷路时，玩家无法在他们的断肠沼泽地图上确定该队伍的位置。下一次，当领航员在智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查中成功进行导航时，将队伍的实际位置透露给玩家。",

	"While you take a brief rest on a patch of relatively dry land, Morgid produces a scrap of bleached leather from his belt—a map of the marsh. His eyes narrow as if trying to pierce the fog ahead as he glances from the marsh to the map and back again.": "当你在一片相对干燥的土地上短暂休息时，莫吉德从他的腰带上拿出一张漂白的皮革碎片--沼泽的地图。他的眼睛眯成一条缝，似乎想刺穿前面的雾气，他的目光从沼泽到地图，又从地图上扫过。",
	"\"The marsh loves outlanders like you,\" he murmurs. \"Loves to gobble 'em up, bones and all. But worry you not, my friends. Morgid will lead the way. Maybe three days of swamp to sift through till we reach Fort Venture. And then it's your time to shine.\" The wild-eyed hobgoblin stuffs the map back into his belt and briskly wades into the bog once more, motioning for you to follow.": "\"沼泽喜欢像你这样的外乡人，\"他喃喃道。\"喜欢吞噬他们，骨头和所有。但你不用担心，我的朋友。莫吉德会带路的。在我们到达风险堡垒之前，可能要经过三天的沼泽地筛选。然后就是你们大显身手的时候了。\" 这个野眼的妖精把地图塞回他的腰带里，轻快地再次涉入沼泽，示意你跟上。",

	"This encounter might occur if the characters approach Fort Venture from the swamp, or if becoming lost drives them south from a course to the Brokenveil Bluffs.

	"One thing is clear, though. Since the garrison at Fort Venture was established, the primordial harmony of the swamp has been disrupted.

	"The Dwendalian stronghold known as Fort Venture sits along a dismal stretch of marsh among the craggy foothills of the Brokenveil Bluffs. A timber palisade surrounds the fort's squat stone keep and muddy grounds, where rows of tents are set up alongside a central training field.

	"Once the characters reach Fort Venture, the hobgoblin guide Morgid offers to run reconnaissance and to distract incoming Dwendalian patrols as the party infiltrates the fort. The precise condition of Fort Venture and its inhabitants is dependent on how long it took the characters to arrive, and how much of {@creature Parson Pellinost|EGW|Parson Pellinost's} ill-fated exorcism of {@creature Bol'bara|EGW} has transpired.

	"If the characters spend the minimum three days traversing the marsh and enter Fort Venture at once, they can either prevent the second phase of Bol'bara's possession or become witness to it. With or without the party's intervention, once Bol'bara enters the second phase of her possession, she plots a return to Urzin and attempts to destroy anyone and anything in her way.": "如果角色们花了至少三天的时间穿越沼泽，并立即进入冒险堡，他们可以阻止波尔巴拉附身的第二阶段，或者成为它的见证人。无论是否有党的干预，一旦Bol'bara进入她附身的第二阶段，她就会策划回到Urzin，并试图摧毁任何阻碍她的人和事。",
	"{@creature Parson Pellinost|EGW|Parson Pellinost's} methods of interrogation for \"troublemakers\" are considered savage by normal imperial standards, but the remote location of the outpost and the soldiers' fear of him have worked in his favor. {@creature Bol'bara|EGW} is of particular interest to the inquisitor, who has been torturing her to death, then bringing her back again using divine healing magic. Bol'bara's full demonic possession is triggered at the end of the third day after the characters set out from Urzin, when Pellinost utilizes the {@spell revivify} spell a third time to bring Bol'bara back to life.": "{@creature Parson Pellinost|EGW|Parson Pellinost's}对 \"麻烦制造者 \"的审讯方法按正常的帝国标准被认为是野蛮的，但前哨站的偏远位置和士兵对他的恐惧对他有利。(1%)对审问者特别感兴趣，他一直把她折磨得死去活来，然后用神圣的治疗魔法让她再次复活。Bol'bara的完全恶魔附身是在人物从Urzin出发后的第三天结束时触发的，当时Pellinost第三次利用{@spell revivify}的咒语使Bol'bara复活。",
	"Once {@creature Bol'bara|EGW} enters the next phase of her demonic possession, she gains two legendary actions granted by the unique supernatural union with her otherworldly patron (see her stat block later in this adventure). Most areas of Fort Venture will be affected by her escape, as indicated by additional descriptive text in the \"Bol'bara's Possession\" section in each area of the fort. Use the appropriate text depending on whether the characters arrive before Bol'bara has been fully corrupted and have a chance to stop the process, or whether her spree of destruction is already underway.": "一旦{@creature Bol'bara|EGW}进入她的恶魔附身的下一阶段，她就会获得与她的异世界守护者的独特超自然结合所赋予的两个传奇行动（见本冒险中稍后的她的状态块）。风险堡垒的大部分区域都会受到她逃跑的影响，正如堡垒中每个区域的 \"波尔巴拉的附身 \"部分的额外描述性文字所指出的。使用适当的文字，取决于人物是在博尔巴拉完全被腐蚀之前到达，并有机会阻止这一过程，还是她的破坏狂潮已经开始了。",
	"Even if they are too late to stop Bol'bara's possession, the characters might want to try to parley with the demon-possessed warlock. Give the players any chance of success that seems appropriate to their efforts, but remember that the shadow demon behind Bol'bara's transformation is a creature of chaos. It savors the taste of discord, and convincing Trush to relinquish its hold over the witch won't be easy.": "即使他们来不及阻止Bol'bara的附身，角色们也可能想尝试与被恶魔附身的术士交涉。给玩家们提供任何适合他们努力的成功机会，但要记住，博尔巴拉转变背后的影子恶魔是一种混乱的生物。它喜欢不和谐的味道，而说服特鲁什放弃对女巫的控制并不容易。",
	"The palisade wall around the fort is easily scouted and assessed from a distance, but more difficult to get past. When the characters draw close to the fort, read:": "堡垒周围的栅栏墙很容易从远处侦察和评估，但更难逾越。当人物接近要塞时，请阅读。",
	"The wooden palisade that encloses Fort Venture stands over ten feet high and is topped by huge spikes. A gate in the middle of the east wall is flanked by two watchtowers and appears to be the only way in or out of the complex. The parapet of the fort's stone keep can be seen rising up from the center of the grounds. Tall grass and knotted brambles partially obscure a well-trodden path that winds up to the gate from the marsh. Rows of spiked barricades encircle the palisade, completing the appearance of a well-fortified military outpost.": "围住风险堡垒的木制栅栏有十多英尺高，上面有巨大的尖刺。东墙中间的大门两侧有两个瞭望塔，似乎是进出该建筑群的唯一途径。可以看到堡垒的石头护栏从场地中央升起。高高的草和打结的荆棘部分地掩盖了一条从沼泽地蜿蜒到大门的熟习的道路。一排排带刺的路障环绕着围墙，使人觉得这是一个防御严密的军事前哨。",
	"Strangers approaching the fort are hailed by the watchtower guards and ordered to identify themselves. At the first sign of trouble (and the guards are inclined to view anything out of the ordinary as ‘trouble'), a guard sounds an alarm on a horn whose call can be heard across the fortress.": "靠近要塞的陌生人会被瞭望塔的守卫叫住，并被命令表明自己的身份。一旦出现麻烦的迹象（守卫倾向于将任何不正常的事情视为 \"麻烦\"），守卫就会用喇叭发出警报，整个堡垒都能听到其呼叫。",
	"A bear trap's attack is +8 to hit and deals 5 ({@dice 1d10}) piercing damage on a hit. This attack can't be made with advantage or disadvantage. A creature hit by the trap also has its speed reduced to 0 and can't move until it breaks free of the trap. Breaking free requires a successful DC 15 Strength check by the trapped creature or another creature within 5 feet of the trap. A successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disables a bear trap.": "捕熊器的攻击是+8的命中率，并在命中时造成5({@dice 1d10}的穿刺伤害。这种攻击不能以优势或劣势进行。被陷阱击中的生物的速度也会降低到0，并且不能移动，直到它挣脱陷阱。挣脱需要被困住的生物或在陷阱5英尺范围内的其他生物成功进行DC15力量检查。使用盗贼的工具，成功地进行DC10的灵巧检查，可以使熊的陷阱失效。",
	"The garrison of Fort Venture are all experienced soldiers and treat all creatures outside the fort as potential threats.

Alternatively, if 1 minute passes from the time the characters arrive and interrupt the torture session, the shadow demon Trush completes its own ritual from the Shadowfell and takes control of the warlock.": "如果角色在从Urzin出发的三天内到达Fort Venture（见本章前面的\"{@adventure Bol'bara's Exorcism|US|0|Bol'bara's Exorcism}\"），他们到达这里时发现{@creature Parson Pellinost|EGW}已经准备好对{@creature Bol'bara|EGW}进行致命一击。如果波尔巴拉被杀，并通过使用{@spell revivify}的法术复活（这是佩里诺斯特第三次以这种方式让她复活），她的异世界守护者就会操纵阴影之城和边境虚无者之间的面纱来占有她。或者，如果从人物到达并打断拷问过程后1分钟过去，影魔特鲁什就会从影域完成自己的仪式并控制术士。",

	"The solitary prisoner is a neutral evil hollow one {@creature cultist} of Ceratos named Alonne Frith, a Far Realm scholar from Rotthold. Frith was captured by a Fort Venture patrol during his journey through the Brokenveil Marsh seeking eldritch relics.

	"If {@creature Bol'bara|EGW} has already been possessed, the two guards are dead and Alonne Frith huddles in his cage, the only living witness to Fort Venture's demise. Frith can describe seeing a lone goblin spellcaster taking on the garrison, and how her power forced many of the soldiers to turn against each other. He can still be asked to join the party, but the Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check to convince him is made with disadvantage.": "如果{@creature Bol'bara|EGW}已经被占有，那两个守卫已经死了，阿隆-弗里斯蜷缩在他的笼子里，是风险堡垒消亡的唯一活着的证人。弗里斯可以描述看到一个孤独的地精施法者对驻军的攻击，以及她的力量如何迫使许多士兵反目成仇。他仍然可以被要求加入聚会，但说服他的魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查是以劣势进行的。",

	"Trouble has come to the roaming village of Urzin, which slowly ambles through the wastes of Xhorhas atop the massive, mossy shells of horizonback tortoises. The village's elder seer, the goblin warlock {@creature Bol'bara|EGW}, has gone missing. Three nights ago, while foraging by night for rare alchemical ingredients, Bol'bara was beset by a cadre of Dwendalian Empire soldiers near the foothills of Brokenveil Bluffs.

He and his advisors suspect the nearby imperial outpost at Fort Venture has something to do with Bol'bara's fate.
