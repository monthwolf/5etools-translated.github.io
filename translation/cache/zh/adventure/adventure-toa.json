	"Something evil is trapping the souls of the dead and draining life from all who have been raised from death by magic.

	"The characters are drawn into the story by {@creature Syndra Silvane|ToA}, a retired adventurer and merchant who, years ago, was raised from the dead. Now, she's withering away. When she consulted priests, Syndra learned that the affliction was widespread and that no spell could cure it. She spoke to her friends among the Harpers, who determined the source of the affliction: an ungodly necromantic device called the Soulmonger. The Harpers received their intelligence from a lich, but they don't know much about the Soulmonger other than its name and general whereabouts. Adventurers willing to help Syndra must travel to Chult, a land of jungles and monsters, to find the Soulmonger and destroy it.": "人物被{@creature Syndra Silvane|ToA}吸引到故事中，她是一个退休的冒险家和商人，多年前，她从死里复活。现在，她正在枯萎。当她咨询牧师时，辛德拉了解到这种痛苦很普遍，而且没有任何法术可以治愈它。她与她在哈珀人中的朋友交谈，他们确定了这种痛苦的来源：一种被称为 \"灵魂使者 \"的不敬神的死灵装置。哈珀人从一个巫师那里得到了他们的情报，但是他们除了知道它的名字和大致的位置之外，对灵魂制造者并没有什么了解。愿意帮助辛德拉的冒险者必须前往丘特，一个充满丛林和怪物的地方，找到灵魂使者并摧毁它。",
	"Also lurking in the heart of Chult is {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA}, a mythic, villainous figure among Chultans. {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA} was a human paladin and a sworn protector of the city of Mezro. He betrayed his oaths and was banished. Rather than redeem himself, he raised an undead army to conquer Mezro. The would-be tyrant was defeated and banished once more. Mezro was later destroyed by the Spellplague (or so it seemed), during which {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA} lost his power to create and command undead. He withdrew to the city of Omu, leaving the vestiges of his undead army to roam unchecked throughout the jungle. That was not the end of {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA}, however. Bitter over his loss of power, he forged an alliance with the yuan-ti lurking in the ruins of Omu and underwent a ritual of transformation, becoming a yuan-ti malison.

	"Over a century ago, the warlord {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA} raised an undead army to conquer the city of Mezro.

Before {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA} could organize another attack, Mezro planeshifted away, and {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA} was stripped of his god-given powers. Declaring himself an enemy of the world, he threw his lot in with the yuan-ti. The remnants of {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA}'s undead army spread through the jungle like a blight, until now they claim hundreds of miles of wilderness as their hunting ground. To make matters worse, {@creature Acererak|ToA} filled out their ranks with horrible undead creatures such as girallon zombies and tyrannosaurus zombies (see {@adventure appendix D|ToA|9}), mainly to discourage explorers from getting too close to Omu.

Others continue worshiping whatever deities they revered before becoming lycanthropes.": "狼虎的骄傲避免外来者，包括冒险者，但少数邪恶的狼虎喜欢以猎杀前来掠夺其土地的入侵者为乐。由于狼虎可以看起来像人类，所以它们很容易就会冒充楚丹的猎人、向导、救援者或探险家来引诱猎物。这些邪恶的狼虎通常崇拜狩猎之神马拉尔。其他人则继续崇拜他们在成为狼人之前所崇敬的任何神灵。",

	"A central figure in Chult's history is the greater god Ubtao, who long protected the land and Chultan civilization. But Ubtao grew angry over his worshipers' endless warring and their reliance on him to solve all their problems. More than a century ago, Ubtao simply abandoned Chult, and his influence hasn't been felt there since that day. When he left, the Chultans suffered a crippling spiritual blow, but eventually the disunited, warring tribes learned to put aside their petty conflicts and unite as one people. To this day, the dinosaurs of Chult are still revered as Ubtao's sacred children by many Chultans, even though Ubtao himself is no longer popular.": "楚尔特历史上的一个核心人物是大神Ubtao，他长期以来保护着这片土地和楚尔特文明。但乌布托对他的崇拜者无休止的战争和他们对他的依赖解决所有的问题感到愤怒。一个多世纪前，Ubtao干脆放弃了Chult，从那一天起，那里就不再有他的影响了。当他离开时，楚尔特人在精神上受到了沉重的打击，但最终，这些不团结的交战部落学会了放下他们的小矛盾，团结成一个民族。时至今日，楚尔特的恐龙仍然被许多楚尔特人尊为乌布托的圣子，尽管乌布托本人已不再受欢迎。",
	"With Ubtao gone, the Chultans turned to other deities, including ones introduced to them by missionaries from distant civilizations.

	"Port Nyanzaru hugs the coastline at the south end of the Bay of Chult. No other city exists in Chult, along the coast or anywhere else, except in ruins or overrun by monstrous creatures. Until recently, Port Nyanzaru was under the firm control of Amn, a foreign nation. Nine years ago, Amn was forced to relinquish the city to a wealthy and powerful consortium of Chultan traders backed by the Ytepka Society (pronounced yeh-TEP-kah), or risk a bloody conflict that probably would have ended with the city winning its independence anyway. Seven Chultan traders have since grown into influential merchant princes, enticing folk from up and down the Sword Coast with their wares.": "尼安扎鲁港拥抱着丘尔特湾南端的海岸线。在楚尔特，除了废墟或被畸形生物占领外，沿海地区或其他地方没有其他城市存在。直到最近，尼安扎鲁港还被一个外国的安恩牢牢控制着。九年前，安恩被迫将这座城市让给一个由Ytepka协会（发音为yeh-TEP-kah）支持的富裕而强大的苏丹商人财团，否则就会冒着血腥冲突的风险，反正最后可能会以这座城市赢得独立而告终。七个苏丹商人从此成长为有影响力的商人王子，用他们的商品诱惑着剑海岸上下的人们。",
	"Port Nyanzaru is a bastion of civilization and commerce in a terrifying land. The amount of business that unfolds here and the cash that moves through its counting houses would make any merchant of Baldur's Gate or Waterdeep jealous. It's also a colorful, musical, aroma-filled, vibrant city in its own right. Other than trade, the biggest attractions are the weekly dinosaur races through the streets. Locals and visitors alike wager princely sums on the races' outcomes. The city also boasts grand bazaars, glorious mansions and temples, circuses, and gladiatorial contests.": "尼安萨鲁港是一片可怕的土地上的文明和商业堡垒。在这里展开的业务量和通过其计价器流动的现金会让博德之门或水底世界的任何商人感到嫉妒。它本身也是一个色彩斑斓、充满音乐、香气四溢、充满活力的城市。除了贸易之外，最大的吸引力是每周在街上举行的恐龙比赛。当地人和游客都在比赛的结果上下注，赌上一笔巨款。这个城市还拥有盛大的集市、辉煌的豪宅和寺庙、马戏团和角斗士比赛。",

	"Beyond all that, Port Nyanzaru is an explosion of color. Buildings are painted in bright shades of blue, green, orange, and salmon pink, or their walls are adorned with murals portraying giant reptiles and mythical heroes.

Multicolored pennants and sun awnings flutter atop the city walls. A crowd of children dressed in feathered hats and capes races past you, squealing in delighted terror as a street performer costumed as a big-toothed lizard stomps and roars behind them. The whole city seems to be bustling, sweating, laughing, swearing, and singing.": "除此以外，尼安扎鲁港是一个色彩爆炸的地方。建筑物被涂成明亮的蓝色、绿色、橙色和鲑鱼粉色，或者墙壁上装饰着描绘巨型爬行动物和神话英雄的壁画。每座建筑都有装着五颜六色花朵的篮子和泥瓮，或者披上了枝繁叶茂的藤蔓。穿着装饰有羽毛和贝壳的鲜艳服装的吟游诗人在街角表演。五颜六色的旗帜和遮阳篷在城墙顶上飘扬。一群戴着羽毛帽子和披风的孩子从你身边跑过，当一个装扮成大牙蜥蜴的街头艺人在他们身后跺脚咆哮时，他们高兴地尖叫起来。整个城市似乎都在喧嚣，汗水，欢笑，咒骂和歌唱。",

	"All the city's water comes from rain, so every building has a cistern or wooden barrels to catch water running off the roof. Every public square is built around a fountain or rain basin. With so much water running downhill, Chultans also make excellent use of water-driven mechanical gadgets. Many buildings have water wheels built into their cisterns. Rainwater running through spouts or channels turns the wheel, which pumps water into pools, turns millstones, powers bellows or lathes or saws, or accomplishes any other labor-saving or amusing task Chultan engineers can dream up.": "该市所有的水都来自于雨水，因此每栋建筑都有一个蓄水池或木桶来接住从屋顶流出的水。每个公共广场都围绕着一个喷泉或雨盆而建。由于有这么多的水从山上流下来，丘尔特人也很好地利用了水驱动的机械装置。许多建筑物的蓄水池里都有水轮。雨水流经水口或渠道，使水轮转动，水轮将水抽入水池，转动磨石，为风箱或车床或锯子提供动力，或完成苏丹工程师能想到的任何其他省力或有趣的任务。",

Undril was led to believe she could simply buy a horse in the city and ride to the camp, but now that she sees the terrain and conditions, that's clearly not possible. She hopes to join any expedition headed up the River Soshenstar. Undril is quite attached to her chain shirt, but she's not unreasonable when presented with good arguments for shedding the armor.

At any time, the party might run into Volothamp Geddarm (see \"{@area City Denizens|054|x}\"). Volo's familiarity with Port Nyanzaru makes him a font of useful information.

Rats, insects, and ravens abound. {@creature Ghoul||Ghouls} are sometimes seen prowling through the pit in search of fresh corpses.": "一个巨大的天坑是这个城市的垃圾场。每种类型的垃圾都被扔在这里，甚至包括尸体。这是一个由垃圾、馊水和害虫组成的溃烂的疤痕。老鼠、昆虫和乌鸦比比皆是。(有时会看到有人在坑里徘徊，寻找新鲜的尸体。",
	"Although the level of refuse in the pit rises and falls, the pit never gets full. This is thanks to an unknown number of {@creature Otyugh||otyughs} living at the bottom and eating their fill daily. They're content to remain in the bountiful pit, but they'd quickly pounce on anyone careless or unlucky enough to slip on the greasy edge and fall in.": "虽然坑里的垃圾水平不断上升和下降，但坑里永远不会满。这要归功于数量不详的{@creature Otyugh||otyughs}住在底部，每天吃饱。它们满足于留在丰饶的坑里，但它们会迅速扑向任何粗心或不幸运地在油腻的边缘滑倒而掉入的人。",
	"The western half of the city is called the Merchants' Ward because it's the site of the Grand Souk and because many of the merchant princes' villas are there. In general, this is the upper-class section of the city. The majority of the city's merchants and traders actually live and work in the Market Ward.": "城市的西半部被称为商人区，因为它是大苏克的所在地，也因为许多商人王子的别墅在那里。一般来说，这里是城市的上层地区。城市的大多数商人和贸易商实际上在市场区生活和工作。",
	"Goldenthrone is the best place to meet any of the merchant princes without an appointment. They rarely meet with visitors who show up unannounced at their homes. During the day, each merchant prince has a 1-in-6 chance to be at Goldenthrone, accompanied by a retinue of aides and guards. Characters must wait {@dice 1d3} hours before being given an audience. In fact, the merchant princes have few day-to-day responsibilities when it comes to running Port Nyanzaru, so unless a meeting is being held to discuss city business, the delay is just a tactic to underscore who's in charge. If the characters have interesting news, they're likely to obtain an audience and to be given as much of the merchant's time as they need.": "Goldenthrone是在没有预约的情况下见到任何一位商人王子的最佳地点。他们很少会见那些突然出现在他们家里的访客。在白天，每个商人王子都有六分之一的机会出现在Goldenthrone，并有一个由助手和卫兵组成的随行人员陪同。角色必须等待{@dice 1d3}个小时才能被接见。事实上，在管理尼安萨鲁港方面，商人王子们几乎没有什么日常的责任，所以除非是在开会讨论城市事务，否则拖延只是一种强调谁是负责人的策略。如果这些人物有有趣的消息，他们就有可能获得接见，并获得商人所需的大量时间。",
	"Each merchant prince has a private villa in the city. These residences have beautifully plastered walls adorned with bright murals, patios and arcades festooned with fresh flowers, garden courtyards open to the sky, and enormous cisterns equipped with water wheels to power fountains, fans, and kinetic sculptures.": "每位商人王子在城里都有一栋私人别墅。这些住宅都有漂亮的石膏墙，上面装饰着明亮的壁画，天井和拱廊上摆放着新鲜的鲜花，花园庭院向天空开放，巨大的蓄水池配备有水轮，为喷泉、风扇和动态雕塑提供动力。",
	"None of the merchant princes is likely to meet player characters who show up unannounced at their doors unless the characters did something noteworthy (such as winning a dinosaur race, stopping a rampaging carnivore, or completing an expedition that made significant discoveries). The exception is {@creature Wakanga O'tamu|ToA}, who welcomes any adventurers traveling in the company of {@creature Syndra Silvane|ToA}.": "没有一个商人王子可能会见到突然出现在他们门前的玩家角色，除非这些角色做了一些值得注意的事情（比如赢得了一场恐龙比赛，阻止了猖獗的食肉动物，或者完成了一次有重大发现的探险）。但{@creature Wakanga O'tamu|ToA}是个例外，他欢迎任何与{@creature Syndra Silvane|ToA}一起旅行的冒险家。",
	"The Grand Souk, or market, is one of the three beating hearts of Port Nyanzaru—the others being the jewel market and the Red Bazaar. True to its name, the Grand Souk is the grandest of the three.": "大苏克（Grand Souk）或市场，是尼安扎鲁港三个跳动的心脏之一，其他的是珠宝市场和红巴扎。顾名思义，大苏克是这三个市场中最宏伟的一个。",
	"Traders from up and down the Sword Coast come to this market to buy timber, spices, medicines concocted from jungle plants, dinosaur skulls and claws, iron, tiger pelts, carved ivory, Batiri and grung handiwork, colored feathers, tropical fruit, monkeys, plesiosaur meat, and all the other riches of Chult. Business begins before the sun comes up, and dealing doesn't stop until well after darkness edges across the city. It's a noisy, jostling, aroma-rich circus. Guards are numerous, but less numerous than the urchins and pickpockets. Street performers and tabaxi minstrels add to the cacophony. Colorful awnings protect the market from sun and rain but also trap the heat and smells.": "来自剑海岸上下的商人来到这个市场，购买木材、香料、丛林植物制成的药物、恐龙头骨和爪子、铁、老虎皮、雕刻的象牙、巴蒂里和格隆的手工艺品、彩色羽毛、热带水果、猴子、长颈龙肉，以及楚尔特的所有其他财富。生意在太阳升起之前就开始了，直到整个城市陷入黑暗之后，交易才会停止。这是一个嘈杂的、打闹的、香气四溢的马戏团。警卫很多，但没有顽童和扒手多。街头艺人和Tabaxi吟游诗人为这一喧嚣增添了不少乐趣。五颜六色的遮阳篷为市场遮挡阳光和雨水，但也阻挡了热量和气味。",
	"Everything listed in {@book chapter 5|PHB|4} of the {@i Player's Handbook} can be purchased in the Grand Souk. Unusual items might not be available (elephants aren't found in Chult, for example), but a merchant can always be contracted who'll bring an item to order, for the right price.": "在{@i Player's Handbook}的{@book chapter 5|PHB|4}中列出的所有东西都可以在大集市上购买。不寻常的物品可能无法买到（例如，大象在楚尔特就没有），但总能找到一个商人，他能以合适的价格带来物品。",
	"Savras is a deity of wizards, fortune tellers, diviners, and those who unfailingly speak the truth regardless of whether listeners want to hear it. His symbol is a monstrous eye, or a crystal ball filled with eyes. Savras's temple is one of the oldest, grandest buildings in the city. The tiled roof of its great dome resembles an unblinking eye, staring skyward.": "萨弗拉斯是巫师、算命师、占卜师以及那些无论听众是否想听都不折不扣地说出真相的神。他的象征是一只怪异的眼睛，或一个充满眼睛的水晶球。萨弗拉斯的神庙是该市最古老、最宏伟的建筑之一。其大圆顶的瓦片屋顶就像一只不眨眼的眼睛，盯着天空。",
	"A deity devoted to revealing the truth might seem to have a weak draw in a city of merchants, but Savras was widely worshiped in Chult long before the Spellplague. In those years, Savras's clergy were valued because they could keep tabs on the activities of the inscrutable yuan-ti. The snake people still loom large as bogeymen in the imaginations of Chultans, but nowadays the clergy of Savras scries into more mundane matters: portents around business affairs, the outlook for newborn children, and affairs of the heart.": "一个致力于揭示真相的神灵在一个商人聚集的城市似乎吸引力不大，但早在法术瘟疫之前，萨弗拉斯就在楚尔特受到广泛的崇拜。在那些年里，萨弗拉斯的神职人员很受重视，因为他们可以监视那些难以捉摸的元老的活动。蛇人在丘特人的想象中仍然是巨大的妖怪，但如今萨弗拉神职人员对更多的世俗事务进行调查：围绕商业事务的预兆、新生儿的前景以及心灵事务。",
	"If he's approached for aid or advice in tracking down the Soulmonger, Zitembe's first reaction is to express disbelief that the death curse has anything to do with Chult. If characters give a compelling argument or make a donation to the church of at least 25 gp, Zitembe agrees to \"consult the guides.\" This ritual takes 24 hours, during which Zitembe sees visions of \"a jungle city far to the south, enclosed by cliffs and crawling with snakes\" and \"a black obelisk draped in vines.\" He dared not peer any deeper, but he urges the characters to seek out this city and the obelisk.": "如果有人向他寻求帮助或建议来追踪灵魂使者，齐坦贝的第一反应是表示不相信死亡诅咒与楚尔特有任何关系。如果人物给出了令人信服的论据，或者向教堂捐赠了至少25金币，齐坦贝就会同意 \"咨询向导\"。这个仪式需要24小时，在此期间，齐坦贝看到了 \"远在南方的丛林城市，被悬崖围住，爬满了蛇 \"和 \"被藤蔓缠住的黑色方尖碑 \"的幻觉。他不敢再深入探究，但他敦促人物去寻找这座城市和方尖碑。",
	"The boxy stone temple of Gond looms behind the royal docks. It's popular among Port Nyanzaru's many artisans, craftspeople, smiths, ivory carvers, and hydro-engineers. Where most such temples have a forge as a centerpiece, this one features an immense fountain whose water jets shift continually to create amazing shapes. It's all done with nozzles and valves moving on cams, driven by the city's plentiful water pressure.": "贡德的方形石庙在皇家码头后面隐约可见。它在尼安扎鲁港的许多工匠、手工艺人、铁匠、象牙雕刻家和水力工程师中很受欢迎。大多数这样的寺庙都以锻造为中心，而这座寺庙的特点是有一个巨大的喷泉，其水柱不断变换，创造出惊人的形状。所有这些都是通过在凸轮上移动的喷嘴和阀门完成的，由城市充足的水压驱动。",
	"Isolated atop a rocky formation in the sea, the temple of Sune is reachable only by an elevated causeway from Temple Hill or by boat. Steep steps wind up the cliff from the temple's small harbor. When seen from a distance, the temple's roof seems to float in midair—an illusion created by mirrors lining the outside walls. Inside, Sune's faithful and casual visitors alike can partake of public baths, receive lessons in applying makeup and styling one's hair, and learn to dress in a manner that suits the individual's body, profession, and the climate. Newcomers to the temple must make a Charisma check. Those who score 15 or higher are welcomed as brothers and sisters of Sune; those who score 10 or higher are offered friendly advice on how to improve their presentation; and those who score 9 or less are greeted with sad, sympathetic looks and surrounded by a crowd of coddling devotees.": "苏内神庙孤立于海中的岩层之上，只有通过从神庙山的高架堤道或乘船才能到达。陡峭的台阶从寺庙的小港口沿着悬崖蜿蜒而上。从远处看，寺庙的屋顶似乎漂浮在半空中--这是由外墙上的镜子造成的幻觉。在里面，苏内的信徒和散客都可以参加公共浴场，接受化妆和头发造型的课程，并学习适合个人身体、职业和气候的着装方式。新到寺庙的人必须进行魅力测试。得分在15分以上的人被欢迎为苏妮的兄弟姐妹；得分在10分以上的人被提供友好的建议，以改善他们的表现；得分在9分以下的人则以悲伤、同情的眼神迎接，被一群溺爱的信徒包围。",
	"Port Nyanzaru's harbor can accommodate ships of all sizes. The enclosed, eastern portion of the harbor is reserved for the use of the merchant princes, but the rest of the docks are available for use by any ship.": "尼安萨鲁港的港口可以容纳各种尺寸的船只。港口的东部封闭部分是为商人王子保留的，但其余的码头可供任何船只使用。",
	"If the characters wish to travel by sea, they can book passage on the {@i Brazen Pegasus} at a cost of 10 gp per day (for the whole party). A 60-foot sloop built for speed, she has a single mast flying a square mainsail plus two triangular foresails, one aft sail, and a small topsail. All that canvas gives her a top speed of 10 mph under ideal conditions.": "如果人物希望从海上旅行，他们可以预订{@i Brazen Pegasus}号的船票，费用为每天10戈比（为整个团队）。这是一艘为速度而建造的60英尺的单桅船，它有一根单桅杆，悬挂着方形的主帆，加上两个三角形的前帆，一个后帆和一个小顶帆。所有这些帆布使她在理想条件下的最高时速为10英里。",
	"Characters might assume that Ortimay's chief business is smuggling—and they'd be correct. However, she is happy to take adventurers wherever they need to go. She knows about the dragon turtle in the Bay of Chult and expects the characters to provide the necessary tribute. She also knows that pirates prowl the waters around Chult, though her ship easily outruns theirs.": "角色们可能会认为奥蒂梅的主要业务是走私--他们会是正确的。不过，她很乐意带冒险者去他们需要去的地方。她知道楚尔特湾的龙龟，并希望人物能提供必要的贡品。她还知道海盗在楚尔特周围的水域徘徊，尽管她的船很容易就能超过他们。",
	"There are no permanent shelters or cabins on the main deck of the {@i Brazen Pegasus}. A tarp can be rigged across the aft portion of the deck for shade from the tropical sun. The sailors sleep on deck when weather permits. The lower deck houses Captain Ortimay's cabin and the cargo hold, which doubles as the crew's cooking, eating, and sleeping area in foul weather.": "在{@i Brazen Pegasus}号的主甲板上没有永久性的庇护所或船舱。可以在甲板的后部挂上篷布，以遮挡热带的阳光。天气允许时，水手们就睡在甲板上。下层甲板上有奥蒂梅船长的船舱和货舱，在恶劣的天气下，货舱可以作为船员的烹饪、饮食和睡眠区。",
	"The term \"royal\" dates back to the age when Chult was ruled by true kings and queens instead of merchants. Now these docks are reserved for the exclusive use of the merchant princes and those diplomats, dignitaries, and influential foreign merchants whom the merchant princes want to flatter with privilege or impress with magnificence.": "皇家 \"一词可以追溯到楚尔特由真正的国王和王后而不是商人统治的时代。现在，这些码头被保留给商人王子和那些外交官、政要和有影响力的外国商人专用，商人王子想用特权来奉承他们，或用华丽来打动他们。",
	"The statue isn't nearly as ancient as the mythic king it portrays. It was erected just five years ago, at a time when Port Nyanzaru was flexing its new mercantile muscle, to impress on foreigners that Chult is an independent land with a glorious history. Few who see it fail to get the message.": "这座雕像并不像它所描绘的神话中的国王那样古老。它是在五年前竖立起来的，当时尼安扎鲁港正在展示其新的商业力量，以向外国人表明楚尔特是一块具有光荣历史的独立土地。看到它的人很少有不明白这个信息的。",
	"If characters present themselves as adventurers, {@creature Zindar|ToA} offers them a quest (see \"{@area Side Quests|031|x}\").": "如果角色以冒险者的身份出现，{@creature Zindar|ToA}会给他们提供一个任务（见\"{@area Side Quests|031|x}\"）。",
	"A flame burns atop the lighthouse day and night to guide ships through darkness, fog, and rain to the harbor. Various powders can be added to the fire to create thick columns of colored smoke that can be seen from Fort Beluarian and from the mines along the Bay of Chult.": "灯塔顶上的火焰日夜燃烧，引导船只穿过黑暗、浓雾和雨水到达港口。可以在火中加入各种粉末，形成厚厚的彩色烟柱，从贝卢安堡和丘特湾沿岸的矿区都可以看到。",
	"The fort contains a winch for raising and lowering an immense iron chain stretched between the fort and the lighthouse. When the chain is raised, no ship can sail into or out of the harbor. The chain hasn't been raised against attackers in decades, but it's used occasionally to prevent a ship from slipping out of the harbor with criminals or contraband on board. The fort also mounts two ballistas that can launch heavy bolts or canisters of alchemist's fire. Its garrison consists of a {@creature noble} (the castellan), four {@creature Veteran||veterans} (officers), and forty {@creature Guard||guards} loyal to the merchant princes.": "堡垒里有一个绞盘，用于提升和降低堡垒和灯塔之间延伸的巨大铁链。当铁链升起时，任何船只都不能驶入或驶出港口。几十年来，这条铁链没有被举起来对付攻击者，但它偶尔会被用来防止一艘载有罪犯或违禁品的船只溜出港口。堡垒还安装了两个弹炮，可以发射重型炮弹或炼金术士的火罐。它的驻军包括一名{@creature noble}(城主)、四名{@creature Veteran||veterans}(军官)和四十名{@creature Guard||guards}效忠于商人王子的人。",
	"Goods of every type being shipped into or out of Port Nyanzaru are stored in these warehouses. Canals are cut between the rows of warehouses, allowing ships to be towed by harnessed dinosaurs directly to the desired warehouse for easier loading and unloading. A large ship can easily block a canal, so good traffic management is required; that's one of the harbormaster's responsibilities.": "运入或运出尼安扎鲁港的各种类型的货物都储存在这些仓库里。在一排排的仓库之间开辟了运河，使船只可以直接被束缚的恐龙拖到所需的仓库，以方便装卸。一艘大船很容易堵塞运河，所以需要良好的交通管理；这也是港务局局长的职责之一。",
	"Like any warehouse district, this one is largely deserted at night, making it a good spot for secret meetings and other mischief.": "和其他仓库区一样，这个仓库区在晚上基本没有人，因此是秘密会议和其他恶作剧的好地方。",
	"Port Nyanzaru isn't famous for building ships, but many vessels that come here wind up needing hull repairs—especially those that had run-ins with typhoons, pirates, or Aremag the dragon turtle (see \"{@area Bay of Chult|0b5|x}\"). It's easy work for dinosaurs to drag ships out of the water into the drydock so holes can be patched and barnacles scraped off.": "Nyanzaru港并不以造船而闻名，但许多来到这里的船只最终都需要修理船体--特别是那些与台风、海盗或龙龟Aremag（见\"{@area Bay of Chult|0b5|x}\"）发生过冲突的船只。对恐龙来说，把船从水里拖到干船坞里是件很容易的事，这样就可以把洞补好，把藤壶刮掉。",
	"The Market Ward is where most of Port Nyanzaru's regular shops are located and where most of its tradesfolk, merchants, and other middle-class residents live and work.": "市场区是尼安扎鲁港大多数常规商店的所在地，也是其大多数贸易人员、商人和其他中产阶级居民生活和工作的地方。",
	"No one knows how the Red Bazaar got its name. One story is that the label comes from the huge slabs of dinosaur meat sold here and the resulting buckets of blood that stain the rain-washed gutters, and that's probably as good an explanation as any.": "没有人知道红色集市的名字是怎么来的。有一种说法是，这个标签来自于这里出售的大块恐龙肉，以及由此产生的沾满雨水的水沟的血桶，这可能是一个很好的解释。",
	"The residents of Port Nyanzaru shop for their daily needs at the Red Bazaar. Unlike the Grand Souk, which deals heavily in durable goods and luxury items, the Red Bazaar deals in everyday needs: locally produced meat, vegetables, tropical fruit, tej, light tropical clothing, insect repellent, rain catchers, and other household goods. The buyers and sellers in the Red Bazaar are predominantly locals.": "尼安扎鲁港的居民在红市集购买他们的日常所需。与大苏克（Grand Souk）大量经营耐用品和奢侈品不同，红巴扎经营的是日常所需：当地生产的肉类、蔬菜、热带水果、茶叶、轻型热带服装、驱虫剂、捕雨器和其他家用物品。红巴扎的买家和卖家主要是当地人。",
	"Seafood is a staple in Port Nyanzaru, both because catching fish is easier and safer than hunting dinosaurs, and tender fish tastes better than tough reptile. The fish market is a great place to buy the day's meals. Prices are higher in the morning, when quality and selection are also better.": "海鲜是尼安扎鲁港的主食，这是因为捕鱼比猎杀恐龙更容易、更安全，而且鲜嫩的鱼比坚硬的爬行动物味道更好。鱼市是购买当天食物的好地方。早上的价格比较高，这时的质量和选择也比较好。",
	"This stone arena is the site of gladiatorial games (usually nonlethal, but accidents happen), bloody animal combats, and spectacular circuses. The best gladiators become celebrities and earn fortunes. Statues of the arena's greatest champions line the tops of the Grand Coliseum's walls, including one of the city's current merchant princes. ({@creature Ekene-Afa|ToA} gained fame and fortune as a gladiator before retiring from the arena to become a trader and politician.)": "这个石头竞技场是角斗士游戏（通常是不致命的，但意外发生）、血腥的动物搏斗和壮观的马戏表演的场所。最好的角斗士成为名人并赚取财富。竞技场最伟大的冠军的雕像在大竞技场的墙顶上排列，其中包括该市目前的一位商人王子。({@creature Ekene-Afa|ToA}作为角斗士获得了名声和财富，然后从竞技场退役，成为一名商人和政治家。)",
	"Events are held on most afternoons; only special shows are held after sundown, as the coliseum depends on natural light. During the week, the bill features qualifying matches, consolation bouts, and other small events. Major events, championships, and special extravaganzas are staged on holidays. A holiday show might include a battle between \"heroes of legend\" and \"pirates\" (all portrayed by gladiators), a bloody match pitting {@creature Velociraptor|VGM|velociraptors} against {@creature Tiger||tigers}, or even a contest of mages battling captured {@creature Ghoul||ghouls}, {@creature Skeleton||skeletons}, or {@creature Zombie||zombies}.": "活动在大多数下午举行；只有特殊的节目在日落后举行，因为竞技场依赖于自然光。在一周内，法案的特点是资格赛、安慰赛和其他小型活动。重大事件、冠军赛和特殊的盛会则在节假日上演。节日演出可能包括 \"传奇英雄 \"和 \"海盗 \"之间的战斗（全部由角斗士扮演），让{@creature Velociraptor|VGM|velociraptors}对阵{@creature Tiger||tigers}的血腥比赛，甚至是法师与被俘的{@creature Ghoul||ghouls}、{@creature Skeleton||skeletons}或{@creature Zombie||zombies}之间的竞赛。",
	"This magnificent structure is a temple to Waukeen, but residents call it the Hall of Gold for its shining, golden roof and for Waukeen's focus on trade and wealth. Mount Sibasa is the highest point in the city, and when the sun is shining, light glinting off the temple roof can be seen for miles out at sea. Some city residents swear that the roof is sheathed in pure burnished gold, but it's only paint. A wide stone bridge connects Mount Sibasa to the Grand Coliseum on Yklwazi Hill.": "这座宏伟的建筑是沃肯的神庙，但居民们称它为黄金大厅，因为它的屋顶金光闪闪，也因为沃肯注重贸易和财富。西巴萨山是该市的最高点，当阳光明媚时，从寺庙屋顶上闪烁的光芒可以在海上看到几英里远。一些城市居民发誓说，屋顶上覆盖着纯熟的黄金，但这只是油漆。一座宽阔的石桥连接着西巴萨山和伊克尔瓦兹山上的大竞技场。",
	"Along with cleanliness, Chultans love colorful clothing. Textile weaving is not one of Chult's native industries, because the jungle isn't suited for growing cotton or raising sheep. However, the jungle and the sea provide everything necessary to concoct vibrant dyes in a rainbow of colors. Merchants import light, plain fabrics, which are dyed in vibrant colors and patterns at the dye works before being sold locally or exported back to the regions where the cloth originated. Local tailors craft the fabric into the long shirts, knee-length pants, sarongs, and kilts favored in Port Nyanzaru.": "除了清洁，楚尔特人还喜欢五颜六色的衣服。纺织业不是楚尔特的本土产业之一，因为丛林不适合种植棉花或饲养绵羊。然而，丛林和海洋提供了一切必要的条件，可以调制出彩虹般鲜艳的染料。商人进口轻薄的素色织物，在染坊染成鲜艳的颜色和图案，然后在当地销售或出口到布的原产地。当地裁缝将这些布料加工成尼安扎鲁港人喜欢的长衬衫、过膝长裤、纱笼和千里马。",
	"The cliff below the dye works and the sea around it are perpetually stained bright orange, blue, red, green, and yellow, depending on what colors are being dumped from the vats that day. People employed at the dye works are easily recognized on the street because their hands and feet are likewise brightly stained.": "染色厂下面的悬崖和周围的海面永远被染成鲜艳的橙色、蓝色、红色、绿色和黄色，这取决于那天从大桶里倒出的是什么颜色。在染坊工作的人在街上很容易被认出，因为他们的手和脚也同样被染得很亮。",
	"This region outside the city walls is Port Nyanzaru's slum district. Two sheer, jungle-draped ridges flank a deep ravine. Ramshackle buildings cling to the sides of the ridges, each structure seemingly built atop the lower one's roof. During heavy rain, runoff pours down the ravine, through Ubtao's Jaws (the large gate in the city wall facing Malar's Throat), and down the paved streets to the harbor, often sweeping along unattended baskets, dead animals, and even clumsy or unlucky Chultans in its tow.": "城墙外的这个区域是尼安扎鲁港的贫民区。两条陡峭的、被丛林覆盖的山脊位于一条深谷的两侧。破旧的建筑依附在山脊的两侧，每座建筑似乎都建在下面的屋顶上。下大雨时，径流顺着峡谷倾泻而下，穿过乌布陶的下巴（城墙上面向马拉尔咽喉的大门），沿着铺设好的街道流向港口，常常把无人看管的篮子、动物尸体，甚至笨拙或不吉利的楚尔丹人拖入其中。",
	"Foot bridges of rope and bamboo hang above the ravine. Some of them are 200 feet long or longer and sway a hundred feet above ground, terrifying the faint of heart. Skilled thieves have been known to drop hooks on thin lines from the bridges and \"fish\" purses right off victims' belts.": "绳索和竹子的脚桥悬挂在峡谷之上。有些桥有200英尺长或更长，在离地面100英尺高的地方摇晃，吓坏了胆小的人。熟练的盗贼已经知道从桥上的细线上放下钩子，直接从受害者的腰带上 \"钓 \"走钱包。",
	"Tymora's temple is built like a sturdy blockhouse of heavy stone. It's not an elegant structure, but residents rely on it to be a safe refuge when floodwater pours down Malar's Throat or when the alarm horns blow and there's no time to reach the safety of the city before undead swarm up the ravine. The people who live in Malar's Throat don't consider themselves especially lucky, but what little luck they have, they attribute to the Lady's presence among them.": "泰莫拉的寺庙就像一个由厚重的石头建成的结实的碉堡。它不是一个优雅的结构，但当洪水从马拉尔之喉倾泻而下，或者当警报喇叭响起，没有时间在亡灵涌入峡谷之前到达城市的安全地带时，居民们依靠它作为一个安全的避难所。住在马拉尔之喉的人并不认为自己特别幸运，但他们所拥有的一点点运气，都归功于夫人在他们中间的存在。",
	"This district east of the city is populated by animal trainers, river folk, explorers who need inexpensive lodging, and other rough-and-tumble sorts. Smugglers prefer the unregulated docks of the anchorage over the policed and inspected docks of the harbor, despite the shortage of dock workers and beast-powered cranes to assist in loading and unloading.": "城市东部的这个地区居住着动物训练师、河民、需要廉价住宿的探险家以及其他粗制滥造的人。尽管缺少码头工人和协助装卸的野兽动力起重机，但走私者更喜欢不受管制的锚地码头，而不是有警察和检查的港口码头。",
	"Unlike Malar's Throat and the Old City, Tiryki Anchorage has no fortified temple or ancient stone ziggurats where residents can take shelter against undead or carnivores. Most people dash for Tiryki Gate when the alarm sounds and hope to get through before it's locked ahead of them. Fortunately, the animals in their pens are more sensitive to approaching enemies than humans are, so few creatures are able to sneak into the area undetected.": "与马拉尔之喉和老城不同，提里基锚地没有强化的寺庙或古老的石制齐格特，居民可以在那里躲避亡灵或食肉动物。大多数人在警报响起时冲向提里基门，希望在门被锁住之前通过。幸运的是，兽栏里的动物对接近的敌人比人类更敏感，所以很少有生物能够不被发现地潜入该地区。",
	"Chultans comprise two-thirds of Port Nyanzaru's population. The city's remaining inhabitants are foreigners, many of whom are profiteers or adventurers seeking either to plunder Chult of its riches or to help protect the city against encroaching monsters.": "楚尔特人占尼安扎鲁港人口的三分之二。这个城市剩下的居民都是外国人，其中许多人是暴发户或冒险家，他们要么寻求掠夺楚尔特的财富，要么帮助保护这个城市免受怪物的侵扰。",

	"Seven merchant princes rule Port Nyanzaru, each one with an equal vote in matters of state. All are Chultan. Their single qualification is that they're the seven richest people in the city.

A merchant prince who retires can yield his or her position to a family member or someone else of immense wealth agreed on by the majority.": "七个商人王子统治尼安扎鲁港，每个人在国家事务中都有平等的投票权。他们都是苏丹人。他们唯一的资格是，他们是这个城市最富有的七个人。他们的统治地是Goldenthrone，一座俯瞰海湾的古老、高贵的阿姆尼亚宫殿。一个退休的商人王子可以把他或她的位置让给一个家庭成员或其他经多数人同意的拥有巨大财富的人。",
	"The merchant princes surround themselves with loyal family and underlings, but they also employ foreign mercenaries both as city guards and as personal guards. Most of these mercenaries are Zhents, and where one finds the Zhentarim, one can also find Harper spies.": "商人王公身边有忠诚的家人和下属，但他们也雇用外国雇佣兵作为城市卫队和私人护卫。这些雇佣兵大多是振特人，在找到振特人的地方，也能找到哈珀人的间谍。",
	"The merchant princes have specific monopolies on all merchandise sold in the city.

	"{@creature Artus Cimber|ToA}, a former member of the Harpers, is hiding out in Chult. He possesses an artifact called the {@item Ring of Winter|ToA}, and other Harpers are concerned lest the ring fall into evil hands. To prevent that, a handful of Harper spies are combing Port Nyanzaru and Chult for clues to Artus's whereabouts—ostensibly to protect the ring, but exactly what they'll do when they find it is an open question. Magical efforts to locate Artus are futile, as the {@item Ring of Winter|ToA} shields itself and its wearer against divination spells and scrying sensors.": "{@creature Artus Cimber|ToA}，一个前哈珀人的成员，正躲藏在楚尔特。他拥有一件名为{@item Ring of Winter|ToA}的神器，其他哈珀人担心戒指落入坏人手中。为了防止这种情况，一些哈珀人的间谍正在尼安扎鲁港和楚尔特寻找阿图斯下落的线索--表面上是为了保护戒指，但他们找到戒指后到底会做什么是个问题。寻找阿图斯的魔法努力是徒劳的，因为{@item Ring of Winter|ToA}保护自己和佩戴者免受占卜法术和窥探传感器的影响。",
	"A number of cities and settlements banded together to form the Lords' Alliance, a coalition that works actively to eliminate threats to their mutual safety and prosperity.

Alliance leaders push their own interests above counterparts from other cities, and operatives seek honor and glory for themselves and their own lords at the expense of less powerful members.": "一些城市和定居点联合起来组成了领主联盟，这个联盟积极致力于消除对他们共同安全和繁荣的威胁。这个联盟是松散的--有些人甚至会说它是不稳定的。联盟领导人将自己的利益凌驾于其他城市的同行之上，特工人员为自己和自己的领主寻求荣誉和荣耀，而牺牲实力较弱的成员。",
	"A key figure in the Lords' Alliance is Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard of Baldur's Gate, a city with a vested interest in the affairs of Chult. The flag of Baldur's Gate flies over the stronghold of Fort Beluarian, which is garrisoned by Flaming Fist mercenaries under the command of Ravengard's vassal, {@creature Liara Portyr|ToA}. If push came to shove, Ravengard would place the priorities of Baldur's Gate above those of the Lord's Alliance.": "领主联盟的一个关键人物是博德之门（Baldur's Gate）的大公Ulder Ravengard，这个城市对楚尔特的事务有着既得利益。博德之门的旗帜飘扬在贝卢安堡的据点上，该据点由拉文加德的附庸{@creature Liara Portyr|ToA}指挥的火焰之拳雇佣兵驻守。如果迫不得已，拉文加德会把博德之门的优先权置于主联盟的优先权之上。",
	"Other Lords' Alliance cities such as Waterdeep and Neverwinter have operatives in Port Nyanzaru, where they undermine the efforts of non-alliance powers such as Calimshan, Amn, and Tethyr to expand their control over Chult's vast resources. Most of these representatives are open about their ties to the Lord's Alliance and style themselves as ambassadors of their cities, but they also employ covert agents to undermine each other's plans and carry out less savory tasks. The Lords' Alliance sponsors mapping expeditions into the peninsula, with the aim of finding more treasures or mines it can plunder.": "其他领主联盟的城市，如沃特迪普和永夜，在尼安萨鲁港都有特工，他们在那里破坏非联盟势力的努力，如卡林山、安恩和泰特希尔，以扩大他们对楚尔特的巨大资源的控制。这些代表中的大多数都公开表示他们与领主联盟的关系，并把自己打扮成他们城市的大使，但他们也雇用秘密特工来破坏对方的计划，并执行不那么令人愉快的任务。领主联盟赞助对半岛的测绘探险，目的是为了找到更多可以掠夺的宝藏或矿场。",

	"Unfortunately, because of the society's secretiveness, not many people understand what those iron tokens signify, and there's a lot of misinformation about the Ytepkas in Port Nyanzaru.

	"The only alternative to buying specialty items through the merchant princes is to deal with the black market, which is highly secretive in Port Nyanzaru; the merchant princes crack down harshly on competitors.

	"Chult is a land of adventure, and this chapter aims to make the characters' wilderness journey a memorable one. By design, the adventure locations are not tailored to characters of a specific level. If the adventuring party is relatively weak, it's up to the players to choose whether to flee instead of fight, negotiate instead of attack, or surrender instead of die. It's up to you as the DM to be flexible and keep the story moving forward as best you can. If an encounter is going badly for the adventurers, you can have the monsters suddenly withdraw, demand the party's surrender, or deal nonlethal damage. You can have an NPC show up to lend assistance. Mindless predators might be scared off by a sudden volcanic eruption or earth tremor. In short, there is always a way to turn the party's misfortune into a fighting chance of survival.": "Chult是一个冒险之地，本章旨在使人物的荒野之旅成为一个令人难忘的旅程。根据设计，冒险地点并不是为特定等级的角色量身定做的。如果冒险队伍的实力相对较弱，那么就要看玩家们如何选择是逃跑而不是战斗，是谈判而不是攻击，还是投降而不是死亡。这取决于你作为管理人是否灵活，并尽可能地使故事向前发展。如果一场遭遇战对冒险者来说很糟糕，你可以让怪物突然撤退，要求队伍投降，或者造成非致命伤害。你可以让一个NPC出现，提供帮助。无意识的掠食者可能会被突然的火山爆发或地动山摇所吓跑。简而言之，总有一种方法可以将队伍的不幸变成生存的机会。",

Canoes move 1 hex per day through swamp.": "在楚尔特的地图上，每个六面体的宽度为10英里。以正常速度行进的角色每天可以在沿海、丛林、山地、沼泽或荒地的地形中步行1个六角。如果他们乘坐独木舟在河流或湖泊中旅行，每天可以走2个六角。沿河而上或沿河而下的速度是一样的；河流是如此的缓慢，水流几乎是难以察觉的。在没有独木舟的情况下，沿河行驶的正常速度与通过周围地形的速度相同。独木舟在沼泽中每天移动1个六角。",

	"Instead of tracking movement by hexes, you can keep track of the actual distances covered (10 miles per day at a normal pace, 15 miles per day at a fast pace, or 9 miles per day at a slow pace), but this is likely to be more bother than it's worth if the group switches pace from day to day.": "你可以记录实际的运动距离（正常速度每天10英里，快速度每天15英里，或慢速度每天9英里），而不是按六边形跟踪运动，但如果小组每天都转换步伐，这可能会造成更多的麻烦。",

The likelihood of an undead encounter increases in territories marked with red skull-and-bones icons. Most guides know these territories well. Where undead are concerned, traveling by river is safer than traveling by land, both because undead are poor swimmers at best and because it's easier to pour on speed in canoes and escape across the water than to flee through tangled jungle.": "亡灵生物几乎将人类文明赶出了半岛，只有几个孤立的前哨站，楚尔坦人和他们的盟友在墙后避难。地图2.1显示了亡灵最密集的地方。角色经过标有黑色骷髅图标的地区时，有可能会随机遇到亡灵。在标有红色骷髅图标的地区，遇到亡灵的可能性会增加。大多数向导对这些地区非常熟悉。就亡灵而言，走河道比走陆路更安全，这是因为亡灵充其量不过是个差劲的游泳者，也因为用独木舟加快速度逃过水面比逃过纠结的丛林更容易。",

	"A stone shrine stands at the midpoint of the bridge. It consists of an imposing statue of a Chultan warrior wearing a war mask, hunkered down like a panther ready to pounce. Like the monkeys elsewhere on the bridge, the carving is highly stylized. Bright gems flash in its eye sockets.": "在桥的中点矗立着一座石制神龛。它由一尊气势磅礴的苏丹战士雕像组成，他戴着战争面具，像一只准备扑食的豹子一样蜷缩着。与桥上其他地方的猴子一样，这个雕刻也是高度风格化的。它的眼窝里闪烁着明亮的宝石。",

	"The corpses around the fort (map 2.4) are the remains of beasts and undead that attacked the camp. The camp dwellers took meat off the dead dinosaurs and other beasts to feed themselves, leaving the rest to rot.": "要塞周围的尸体（地图2.4）是袭击营地的野兽和亡灵的残骸。营地居民从死去的恐龙和其他野兽身上取下肉来养活自己，剩下的就任其腐烂。",
	"A handful of warriors of the Order of the Gauntlet escaped the undead onslaught against Camp Righteous by retreating up the River Soshenstar toward the Aldani Basin. Three days later, they ended their retreat by digging in on this spot. Eventually they got word of their situation back to Port Nyanzaru, and they've since been reinforced. Their original, small camp has been transformed into a fortified base far more capable of withstanding attack than Camp Righteous ever was.": "少数高塔骑士团的战士们沿着索申星河向阿尔达尼盆地撤退，躲过了对正义营的亡灵攻击。三天后，他们在这个地方掘地三尺，结束了他们的退路。最终，他们把自己的情况传回了尼安扎鲁港，此后他们得到了增援。他们原来的小营地已经变成了一个强化的基地，比正义营地更有能力抵御攻击。",
	"That's not to say the camp is a hale and healthy place. Unwholesome vapors and clouds of insects descend on it from the pestilential Aldani Basin lying only a few miles to the south. The knights stationed here are disease-ridden and exhausted from their constant battles against giant jungle carnivores by day and undead horrors by night.": "这并不是说这个营地是一个健康的地方。不健康的蒸汽和昆虫云从距离南部仅几英里的瘟疫的阿尔达尼盆地降临到这里。驻扎在这里的骑士们疾病缠身，白天与巨大的丛林食肉动物作战，晚上与不死的恐怖动物作战，他们已经筋疲力尽。",
	"Although the camp gets much of its food by hunting, it depends entirely on rowboats and canoes coming up the River Soshenstar to bring replacement soldiers, armor, weapons, arrows and bolts, medicine, tents, cots, boots, clothing, and just about everything else. After the disaster at Camp Righteous, Commander Breakbone would like to have enough boats on hand to carry most, if not all, of the garrison to safety in case the camp is overrun. That's seldom the case.": "虽然营地的大部分食物是通过狩猎获得的，但它完全依靠索申星河上的划艇和独木舟来运送替换的士兵、盔甲、武器、箭和螺栓、药品、帐篷、帆布床、靴子、衣服，以及其他几乎所有东西。在正义营发生灾难后，指挥官Breakbone希望手头有足够的船，以便在营地被攻破的情况下，将大部分（如果不是全部）驻军运到安全地带。这种情况很少发生。",
	"The camp is ringed by a 20-foot-deep ditch lined with sharpened stakes backed by a stout, 12-foot-high log palisade. The depth of the ditch isn't apparent because it's perpetually filled with muddy water. The spikes are too big to be effective against undead but they're dangerous to Large and Huge beasts. The gatehouse is heavy enough to withstand a charging triceratops, and the gates are never opened without an express command from one of the camp's top three officers.": "营地周围有一条20英尺深的沟渠，沟渠内有削尖的木桩，后面是坚固的、12英尺高的木栅栏。沟渠的深度并不明显，因为它永远充满了泥水。钉子太大，对亡灵无效，但对大型和巨大的野兽却很危险。门楼很重，足以承受冲锋陷阵的三角龙，而且如果没有营地三大官员之一的明确命令，大门永远不会打开。",
	"The rampart under the palisade impedes the camp's drainage. The entire compound is riddled with puddles and ankle-deep mud, which make it a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other vermin.": "栅栏下的壁垒阻碍了营地的排水系统。整个大院布满了水坑和深达脚踝的泥浆，这使它成为蚊子和其他害虫的滋生地。",
	"Each watchtower has a defended top level (providing three-quarters cover) that looms above the camp palisade. A lower level consists of a wooden floor raised several feet above the ground and enclosed with a combination of thin wood and canvas to create a reasonably dry living space. Lorsa Bilwatal, Wulf Rygor, and their cadre of Chultan scouts have their quarters in these lower watchtower billets.": "每个瞭望塔都有一个防御性的顶层（提供四分之三的掩护），在营地的围墙之上隐约可见。下层由高出地面数英尺的木质地板组成，并由薄木和帆布组合而成，形成一个相当干燥的生活空间。洛萨-比尔瓦特、武尔夫-雷戈尔和他们的苏丹侦察员骨干都在这些低层瞭望台的小屋里住着。",
	"The knights built this pen for swine, but the camp proved too unhealthy for them and they all died. The current livestock consists of four sickly goats.": "骑士们为猪建造了这个围栏，但事实证明这个营地对猪来说太不健康了，它们都死了。目前的牲畜包括四只生病的山羊。",
	"Commander Breakbone understands war well enough when it involves battle lines, waving banners, trumpets, and supply trains, but this war of ambush and creeping through the jungle only mystifies and frustrates him. He spends most of his time in his command tent, poring over inaccurate maps and reviewing reports about the camp's supplies. His two immediate subordinates, Ord Firebeard and Perne Salhana, do a commendable job of managing the camp in the absence of effective leadership from Breakbone.": "当战争涉及到战线、挥舞的旗帜、号角和补给列车时，Breakbone指挥官对战争有足够的理解，但这场埋伏和在丛林中匍匐前进的战争只会让他感到神秘和沮丧。他的大部分时间都在他的指挥帐篷里，翻阅不准确的地图，审查关于营地供应的报告。他的两个直属部下，奥德-火胡子和佩尔内-萨尔哈纳，在没有断骨的有效领导下，在管理营地方面做了值得称赞的工作。",
	"Sufficiently powerful characters might actually win a fight against the entire camp, but even if they do, they'll be marked for death by the Order of the Gauntlet wherever they go in Chult (and potentially elsewhere in the Realms). If characters escorted Undril Silvertusk to the camp and gained her respect (see \"{@area Side Quests|031|x}\"), she will intercede on their behalf and persuade Commander Breakbone to let the characters go. Otherwise, they'll need to win over both Ord and Perne with persuasive arguments to avoid Breakbone's judgment. Each of them can be swayed with a successful DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, but only if the character making the check has a sound case for leniency.": "足够强大的角色可能会在与整个营地的战斗中获胜，但即使如此，他们无论走到哪里都会被高塔骑士团标记为死亡（也有可能是在王国的其他地方）。如果角色护送Undril Silvertusk到营地并获得她的尊重（见\"{@area Side Quests|031|x}\"），她会代表他们进行斡旋，并说服指挥官Breakbone放走角色。否则，他们需要用有说服力的论据来赢得奥德和佩内的支持，以避免断骨的判决。他们中的每一个人都可以通过成功的DC15魅力({@skill Persuasion})检查而被动摇，但前提是进行检查的角色有充分的理由要求宽大处理。",
	"Each tent is intended to house four people in reasonable comfort. They have log floors to keep the occupants above the mud, and reed-filled cloth mattresses for sleeping on. None of the material, however, is suitable for long-term use in Chult. The canvas is riddled with mildew and fungus, dampness quickly seeps up through the floors, and vermin of every imaginable variety thrives in the mattresses.": "每个帐篷可容纳四个人，舒适度相当高。它们有原木地板，以保持居住者高于泥土，并有填充芦苇的布质床垫供睡眠。然而，这些材料都不适合在楚尔特长期使用。帆布上布满了霉菌和真菌，湿气很快就从地板上渗上来，各种可以想象的害虫在床垫上滋生。",
	"Anywhere but Chult, these latrines would be excellent. Here, daily rain floods the pits and flushes their contents through the camp. As if that's not bad enough, the wooden structures are sinking into the soft ground around the pits, threatening at any moment to collapse utterly. Most soldiers in the camp avoid the latrines and instead relieve themselves in the jungle (if they can volunteer for outside work details) or over the top of the palisade wall. Either option is safer and more sanitary than using the latrines.": "除了楚尔特，在任何地方，这些厕所都是很好的。在这里，每天的雨水都会淹没这些坑，并将里面的东西冲到营地里。如果这还不够糟糕的话，这些木制结构正沉入坑洞周围的软土中，随时都有可能彻底坍塌。营地里的大多数士兵都避开了厕所，而是在丛林中解手（如果他们能自愿参加外面的工作细节）或在围墙顶部解手。无论哪种选择都比使用厕所更安全、更卫生。",
	"Lava pouring into the sea from nearby volcanoes causes immense columns of steam to continually erupt from this bay. This steam combined with billowing clouds of ash and black smoke from the volcanoes give the bay its name. No sea life survives in the bay—the poisoned water is perpetually covered by a layer of floating soot—and vegetation along the coast is all dead and coated in ash.": "熔岩从附近的火山涌入大海，导致巨大的蒸汽柱不断从这个海湾喷出。这种蒸汽加上火山喷出的灰烬和黑烟云，使海湾得名。海湾里没有任何海洋生物存活--有毒的水永远被一层漂浮的烟尘所覆盖，沿海的植被全部死亡并被灰烬所覆盖。",
	"The grungs of Dungrunglung (map 2.5) toil under the tyranny of their despotic king, Groak, who is obsessed with summoning the goddess Nangnang and mating with her. To please their king, the grungs have erected a 60-foot-tall mud shrine, where Groak plans to woo the goddess and where she, in turn, can bless him with generations of god-touched, royal Groaklings.": "敦格隆（Dungrunglung，地图2.5）的格格们在他们专制的国王Groak的暴政下苦苦挣扎，他痴迷于召唤Nangnang女神并与她交配。为了取悦他们的国王，草原人建立了一个60英尺高的泥土神殿，Groak打算在那里向女神求爱，而女神也可以在那里为他保佑一代又一代的神灵、皇家Groaklings。",
	"Although grungs are traditionally scheming, greedy, and generally unpleasant to deal with, the grungs of Dungrunglung are experiencing desperate times. Ghouls and zombies threaten their existence, and grung poison is ineffective against the undead. Consequently, the grungs are strongly incentivized to use outsiders to solve their undead problem instead of making slaves or meals out of them.": "虽然格格们历来都很有心计、贪婪，而且一般都不喜欢与人打交道，但敦格隆的格格们正经历着绝望的时刻。食尸鬼和僵尸威胁着他们的生存，而grung的毒药对亡灵是无效的。因此，grungs有强烈的动机利用外来者来解决他们的亡灵问题，而不是把他们当作奴隶或食物。",

Valindra created a {@spell teleportation circle} inside the heart that she uses to travel instantly to and from Thay (where her phylactery is safely stored), to deliver reports to Szass Tam and pick up new instructions.": "{@creature Valindra Shadowmantle|ToA}为萨斯-塔姆工作，他是泰伊的红袍巫师中最强大的巫师，尽管她自己不是红袍巫师。她发现了那颗心脏，并把它改造成一个基地，在她的部下寻找灵魂使者时使用。Szass Tam给她的命令是夺取对灵魂使者的控制权，如果可能的话，否则就摧毁它。瓦林德拉在心脏内制造了一个{@spell teleportation circle}，她用它来即时往返于泰伊（她的法器被安全地存放在那里），向萨斯-塔姆递交报告并接受新的指示。",
	"Characters who explore the Heart of Ubtao are certain to meet Valindra. She's considered the possibility that adventurers might cross her path, and she won't necessarily be hostile toward them. Her mission is to seize the Soulmonger by any means; if adventurers can help her achieve that, she'll use them.": "探索Ubtao之心的角色肯定会遇到Valindra。她已经考虑到冒险者可能会与她擦肩而过，而且她不一定会对他们有敌意。她的任务是不择手段地夺取灵魂使者；如果冒险者能帮助她实现这一目标，她会利用他们。",
	"{@creature Valindra Shadowmantle|ToA|Valindra} is an elven {@creature lich}, with these changes:": "{@creature Valindra Shadowmantle|ToA|Valindra}是精灵族的{@creature lich}，有这些变化。",
	"Valindra is neutral evil.": "瓦林德拉是中性邪恶。",
	"She speaks Abyssal, Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, and Infernal.": "她会说深渊语、普通话、德拉贡语、矮人语、精灵语和地狱语。",
	"When preparing her spells, Valindra can swap out any spell on her list of prepared spells for another wizard spell of the same level.": "在准备她的法术时，瓦林德拉可以将她准备的法术清单上的任何法术换成另一个相同级别的巫师法术。",
	"As a bonus action, Valindra can mask her shriveled flesh and appear to be a living elf. This magical illusion lasts until she ends it as a bonus action or until she uses her Frightening Gaze legendary action. The effect also ends if Valindra drops to 30 hit points or fewer, or if {@spell dispel magic} is cast on her.": "作为奖励动作，瓦林德拉可以掩盖她干瘪的肉体，看起来像个活的精灵。这种神奇的幻觉一直持续到她作为奖励动作结束，或者直到她使用惊恐凝视的传奇动作。如果瓦林德拉的生命值下降到30点或更少，或者如果{@spell dispel magic}被施加在她身上，这个效果也会结束。",
	"She can't take lair actions in the Heart of Ubtao.": "她在乌伯托之心不能采取巢穴行动。",
	"With her ability to appear as a living elf, Valindra can easily conceal her lichdom and her association to Thay. She presents herself as a scholarly wizard who wants to \"imprison\" the Soulmonger; that way, its unique magic can be studied while it's safely quarantined from the world. She argues that destroying it should be a last resort.": "由于她能以活的精灵的身份出现，瓦林德拉可以轻易地掩盖她的巫师身份和她与泰伊的关系。她把自己说成是一个想 \"囚禁 \"灵魂使者的学者型巫师；这样一来，它的独特魔法就可以被研究，而它则被安全地隔离在世界之外。她认为，摧毁它应该是最后的手段。",
	"Valindra believes that the Soulmonger is hidden somewhere in the ruins of Omu. She shares this information with the characters even if she suspects they'll betray her down the road, because in the meantime, they might weaken some of Omu's defenses.": "瓦林德拉相信灵魂使者就藏在奥姆的某处废墟中。她与这些人物分享这一信息，即使她怀疑他们会在接下来的时间里背叛她，因为在此期间，他们可能会削弱奥姆的一些防御措施。",
	"These stairs are smooth and don't show much sign of wear. Only a handful of creatures have walked on them: Valindra, a few of her servants, and the priests of Ubtao who made pilgrimages to the heart. There's no risk of falling off unless a character does something foolish, but the height is dizzying.": "这些楼梯很光滑，没有什么磨损的痕迹。只有少数生物在上面走过。瓦林德拉，她的几个仆人，以及朝拜心脏的乌布托的祭司们。除非角色做了傻事，否则没有掉下去的危险，但高度令人头晕目眩。",
	"The floor of this entrance slopes up slightly toward the inside of the heart, so water streams out through it continually. The cave mouth appears natural, unlike the steps outside it.": "这个入口的地面向心脏内部略微倾斜，所以水不断地从这里流出来。洞口显得很自然，与洞外的台阶不同。",
	"This cave is musty and dimly lit by daylight filtering down through the hollow, petrified tree trunk 20 feet above. A pool of dirty rainwater occupies the central 20 feet of the floor, between natural pillars formed by the roots of the petrified tree. Three tall bookcases stand against the wall to the right of the cave entrance. A desk and several wooden crates stand against the left-hand wall. Opposite the entrance are two open doorways into smaller chambers and, between them, a large iron cage.": "这个洞穴充满了霉味，日光从20英尺高的空心石化树干上过滤下来，光线很暗。一池肮脏的雨水占据了地板的中央20英尺，在石化树根形成的天然支柱之间。三个高大的书柜靠着洞口右边的墙站着。一张书桌和几个木箱靠着左边的墙站着。入口对面有两个开放的门洞，通往较小的房间，在它们之间有一个大铁笼子。",
	"{@creature Valindra Shadowmantle|ToA|Valindra's} undead patrols sometimes capture luckless explorers and bring them here. Prisoners are kept in the iron cage while Valindra questions them, then disposed of in the swamp. The cage is not in use when characters arrive, unless you choose to place {@creature Artus Cimber|ToA} and {@creature Dragonbait|ToA} here as prisoners.": "{@creature Valindra Shadowmantle|ToA|Valindra's}亡灵巡逻队有时会抓捕运气不好的探险者，并把他们带到这里。囚犯被关在铁笼子里，瓦林德拉对他们进行盘问，然后在沼泽地里被处理掉。当人物到达时，铁笼并没有被使用，除非你选择将{@creature Artus Cimber|ToA}和{@creature Dragonbait|ToA}作为囚犯放在这里。",
	"As a lich, Valindra isn't bothered by how dank and uncomfortable the cave is. If that subject comes up, she explains that as an elf, she has no need for a bed or for hours and hours of sleep; she simply meditates for a while at her desk each day. The rest of her time is spent poring over her maps and histories, searching for likely hiding spots for the Soulmonger.": "作为一个巫师，瓦林德拉并不为山洞的潮湿和不舒服而烦恼。如果提到这个话题，她解释说，作为一个精灵，她不需要床，也不需要几个小时的睡眠；她只是每天在她的桌子前冥想一会儿。她其余的时间都用来研究她的地图和历史，寻找可能藏匿灵魂使者的地点。",
	"The bookcases are filled with books, scrolls, tablets, and maps, all about Chult in one way or another. They cover history, geography, culture, and natural philosophy in great depth, but all of them predate the Spellplague. Valindra would literally kill to possess {@creature Syndra Silvane|ToA}'s map, if she learns of its existence. Her spellbooks aren't here—they're safe back in Thay—but the shelves do hold two {@item Spell Scroll||spell scrolls} of {@spell arcane gate}.": "书柜里摆满了书籍、卷轴、石板和地图，都是以这种或那种方式关于丘特的。它们涵盖了历史、地理、文化和自然哲学的深度，但所有这些都是在法术瘟疫之前的。如果瓦林德拉知道了地图的存在，她真的会杀人灭口，以拥有{@creature Syndra Silvane|ToA}的地图。她的法术书不在这里--它们安全地回到了泰伊，但书架上确实有两本{@item Spell Scroll||spell scrolls}的{@spell arcane gate}。",
	"{@creature Valindra Shadowmantle|ToA|Valindra's} {@spell teleportation circle} is etched onto the floor of this chamber. Anyone with proficiency in the {@skill Arcana} skill recognizes what the circle is and can write down or memorize its sigils so it can be used as a destination from another {@spell teleportation circle}. Valindra isn't foolish enough to leave the sigils from her Thayan circle scribbled somewhere in this lair, so no one can follow her if she chooses to escape.": "{@creature Valindra Shadowmantle|ToA|Valindra's} {@spell teleportation circle}被刻在这个房间的地板上。任何精通{@skill Arcana}技能的人都能认出这个圆圈是什么，并能写下或记住它的符号，这样它就能被用作另一个{@spell teleportation circle}的目的地。瓦林德拉并没有愚蠢到把她的塔扬圈的符号涂抹在这个巢穴的某个地方，所以如果她选择逃跑，没有人可以跟踪她。",
	"This ruined yuan-ti city stands in the jungle at the foot of the Crown, a fuming volcano that marks the western end of the Sky Lizard Mountains. A powerful ward similar to that of an {@spell antipathy/sympathy} spell prevents yuan-ti from entering the city. Many of the serpent folk who once dwelled here have since relocated to Omu.": "这座废墟般的元老级城市矗立在皇冠山脚下的丛林中，皇冠山是一座冒烟的火山，标志着天蜥山脉的西端。一个类似于{@spell antipathy/sympathy}法术的强大防护装置阻止元帝进入这个城市。许多曾经居住在这里的蛇人后来都迁到了奥姆。",
	"The earth swallowed half of the city, which rests in a sprawling underground cavern that has never been warmed by the sun. The rest of Hisari remains above ground, engulfed by vines and creeping flowers. Every brick and pillar is coated in moss, and a latticework of roots and ash covers the city's cracked, golden domes.": "大地吞噬了一半的城市，它安放在一个从未被太阳温暖过的庞大的地下洞穴中。希萨里的其余部分仍然在地面上，被藤蔓和爬行的花朵所吞噬。每块砖和每根柱子都长满了青苔，根和灰的格子覆盖着城市破裂的金色圆顶。",
	"Nearby volcanic eruptions forced the dwarves to abandon Hrakhamar (map 2.9). They always intended to reoccupy and reactivate the forge when it was deemed safe, but that day never came.": "附近的火山爆发迫使矮人放弃了赫拉卡玛（地图2.9）。他们一直打算在被认为安全的时候重新占领并重新启动锻造厂，但这一天从未到来。",
	"Firenewts moved in and put the forge to work crafting armor and weapons for themselves. A small group of albino dwarves lurks in the jungle nearby and keeps watch on the forge, but their numbers are too low to challenge the firenewts.": "火牛们搬了进来，把锻造厂用来为自己制作盔甲和武器。一小群白化的矮人潜伏在附近的丛林里，监视着锻造厂，但他们的人数太少，无法挑战火牛人。",
	"The dwarves offer to stand guard outside while the characters rid Hrakhamar of firenewts. If the characters seem underpowered or in need of a guide, Sithi offers to accompany them. She remembers the layout of the forge but doesn't know how many firenewts are inside, or where they might be hiding.": "矮人提出在人物清除赫拉卡玛的火虫时在外面站岗。如果角色们看起来力量不足或需要一个向导，Sithi就会提议陪同他们。她记得锻造厂的布局，但不知道里面有多少只火牛，也不知道它们可能藏在哪里。",
	"When the forge was operated by the dwarves, it was linked by trade roads to Shilku Bay and other points on the peninsula. Although those roads have endured a century of neglect, in the vicinity of the forge they were of dwarven construction, and not even a century of disrepair can erase a dwarven road. The roads are buried under ash in the Valley of Lost Honor, but where the mountains rise above the ash plain, the road can be spotted easily and followed to the forge entrance. A character who makes a successful DC 13 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check while examining the road sees scorch marks indicative of firenewts or other flame creatures using it.": "当锻造厂由矮人经营时，它与希尔库湾和半岛上的其他地方有贸易道路相连。虽然这些道路经历了一个世纪的荒废，但在锻造厂附近，它们是矮人建造的，即使是一个世纪的失修也不能抹去一条矮人的道路。在失落的荣誉谷，道路被掩埋在灰烬之下，但在山峰高于灰烬平原的地方，可以很容易地发现道路，并沿着它到达锻造厂入口。一个在检查道路时成功进行DC13智慧({@skill Survival})检查的角色会看到焦痕，表明火牛或其他火焰生物在使用它。",
	"When the characters reach Hrakhamar, read:": "当人物到达赫拉卡玛时，阅读。",
	"The entrance is a 10-foot-tall arched doorway beneath a massive relief carving of a crossed hammer and tongs. Two iron doors were fitted to the entrance, but one lies on the ground, completely rusted off its hinges, and the other sags so badly it appears as if it could collapse at any moment. Several buildings once stood outside the forge, but they've been reduced to their foundations.": "入口处是一个10英尺高的拱形门，下面有一个巨大的浮雕，是一个交叉的锤子和钳子。入口处装有两扇铁门，但其中一扇躺在地上，铰链完全生锈，另一扇下垂得很厉害，似乎随时都会倒塌。锻造厂外面曾经有几座建筑，但它们已经沦为了地基。",
	"The entrance gradually narrows to just 5 feet wide by 10 feet high. The tunnel proceeds this way, sloping downward very slightly but with occasional staircases leading down, for three-quarters of a mile before reaching the forge proper. Scorch marks cover the walls and floor.": "入口逐渐变窄，只有5英尺宽，10英尺高。隧道就这样进行着，略微向下倾斜，但偶尔会有楼梯通向下面，在到达锻造厂的正门之前有四分之三英里。墙壁和地板上都有烧焦的痕迹。",
	"The dwarves exploited a volcanic rift in the heart of Hrakhamar to smelt iron and adamantine, which they lowered into the magma in clay crucibles.": "矮人利用赫拉卡玛中心地带的火山裂缝来冶炼铁和金刚砂，他们把这些东西放在粘土坩埚中放入岩浆中。",
	"A cavern of molten magma bubbles and flames before you. The cavern walls are lined with metal gantries and cranes that support immense crucibles of scorched clay. Huge chains stretch across the cavern, apparently to shuttle multi-ton buckets of ore across the lava. The heat takes your breath away, brings water to your eyes, and bakes your skin. From where you stand, the only obvious way across is via a narrow stone trestle built for rail carts. The sound of rhythmic hammering comes from somewhere beyond the magma rift.": "在你面前有一个熔融岩浆的洞穴，冒着气泡和火焰。洞壁上有金属门架和吊车，支撑着巨大的焦土坩埚。巨大的链条横跨洞穴，显然是为了将数吨重的矿石桶穿梭于熔岩之中。热量让你喘不过气来，让你的眼睛进水，让你的皮肤发烫。从你站立的地方看，唯一明显的途径是通过一条为轨道车建造的狭窄的石头栈道。有节奏的敲击声来自岩浆裂缝之外的某个地方。",
	"The magma is 10 feet below the level of the gantries and the rail cart trestles. Great chains span the rift in two places, allowing ore to be hoisted across in buckets.": "岩浆低于门架和轨道车栈桥的水平线10英尺。大铁链在两个地方横跨裂缝，使矿石可以用桶吊过去。",
	"The hammering sound grows louder, but it's not coming from the chamber ahead. This enormous, rectangular chamber is a working smelter. A rectangular pit in the center of the room is filled with molten iron. Six devices of dwarven design and make, arranged around the pit, siphon off the liquid metal and draw out the impurities. A smaller pool in the southeast corner holds what appears to be molten silver.": "敲击声越来越大，但它不是来自前面的室。这个巨大的长方形密室是一个正在工作的冶炼厂。房间中央的一个长方形坑里充满了熔化的铁水。六个由矮人设计和制造的装置排列在坑的周围，将液态金属吸走，并将杂质吸出。东南角的一个较小的水池里装着似乎是熔化的银。",
	"Creatures that look like a mix of humanoid amphibians and elemental fire are tending to the machines. So far, they haven't noticed you.": "看起来像人形两栖动物和火元素的混合体的生物正在照看机器。到目前为止，他们还没有注意到你。",
	"The hammering sound comes from the east.": "敲击声来自东方。",
	"The central pit contains molten iron. The smaller pool contains molten adamantine, not silver. A creature that falls into either pit or starts its turn there takes 55 ({@dice 10d10}) fire damage.": "中央的坑里有熔化的铁。较小的池子里有熔化的金刚砂，而不是银。掉入任何一个坑中的生物或从那里开始的回合都会受到55({@dice 10d10})的火焰伤害。",
	"The crane to the south (overhanging {@area area 1|118|x}) is used to lower a crucible of ore into the magma river until the ore is liquid. Liquified ore is rolled along the tracks into area 2, where it's dumped into the appropriate cauldron.": "南面的起重机（悬空{@area area 1|118|x}）被用来把装有矿石的坩埚放入岩浆河中，直到矿石变成液体。液化的矿石沿着轨道滚入2号区域，在那里被倒入相应的大锅。",
	"The dwarves' enemies coveted the riches of Hrakhamar. To defend their trove, the dwarves stockpiled weapons and armor in this chamber. The firenewts haven't bothered most of it; they prefer their own weapons over heavier dwarven designs, and the dwarves' armor doesn't fit them.": "矮人的敌人觊觎着赫拉卡玛的财富。为了保卫他们的宝库，矮人将武器和盔甲囤积在这个房间里。火蝾螈没有理会其中的大部分，他们更喜欢自己的武器，而不是矮人设计的重型武器，而且矮人的盔甲也不适合他们。",
	"This chamber includes six each of battleaxes, greataxes, mauls, morningstars, war picks, warhammers, and heavy crossbows, plus two hundred crossbow bolts and four suits of dwarven half-plate armor. If characters are led here by Sithi Vinecutter, she's willing to let the characters take one weapon apiece.": "这个房间包括战斧、大斧、大锤、晨星、战镐、战锤和重弩各六把，外加两百支弩箭和四套矮人半身盔甲。如果角色是由西蒂-维纳克特带领来的，她愿意让角色们每人拿一件武器。",

	"In these chambers, the dwarves stored supplies of every kind, from food to leather aprons to protective goggles to parchment and ink. The firenewts looted all of it. Now the chief features of these rooms are \"nests\" of ancient dwarven clothing, insulated gloves, and other padded material that the firenewts sleep on in shifts. The smell in this area is horrid, like burning hair mixed with burning rubber. A disturbance in any of the chambers awakens and draws in all the firenewts in the storage area.": "在这些房间里，矮人储存了各种物资，从食物到皮围裙到防护镜，再到羊皮纸和墨水。火牛们把这些东西都洗劫一空。现在，这些房间的主要特征是 \"窝\"，由古代矮人的衣服、绝缘手套和其他填充材料组成，火牛们轮流在上面睡觉。这个区域的气味是可怕的，就像燃烧的头发与燃烧的橡胶混合在一起。任何一个房间里的骚动都会唤醒并吸引储存区的所有火牛。",
	"Two suits of dwarven half plate armor stand on either side of an adamantine-banded iron door. These suits of armor were beautiful once, but now they're scarred by weapons, scorched by fire, and smeared with filth. The door has two locks, one above the other.": "两套矮人半板甲站在一扇镶有金刚砂的铁门两边。这些盔甲曾经很美，但现在它们被武器弄得伤痕累累，被火烧得焦黄，还沾满了污垢。这扇门有两把锁，一把在另一把上面。",
	"The dwarves sealed their treasure vault before leaving Hrakhamar, and it's remained sealed to this day. Despite their best efforts, the firenewts have been unable to force the door or defeat the locks.": "矮人在离开赫拉卡玛之前封住了他们的宝库，直到今天还封着。尽管他们尽了最大的努力，但火牛们还是无法强行打开大门或破坏锁具。",
	"The door's upper lock is embedded in an adamantine frame resembling a stylized form of the dwarven rune for \"beginnings.\" The rune can be interpreted correctly by a character who reads Dwarvish. The lower lock was originally embedded in a golden frame in the shape of a stylized dwarven rune for \"endings,\" but the firenewts scraped away the gold and used it to decorate their shrine to Imix ({@area area 7|125|x}). Scarring on the door hints at what used to be there; it can be interpreted correctly by someone who reads Dwarvish and makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check. Each lock can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.": "门的上锁嵌在一个金刚砂框架中，类似于矮人 \"开始 \"符文的风格化形式。这个符文可以被一个懂矮人语的人正确解读。下面的锁原本是嵌在一个金色的框架里，形状是矮人的 \"结束 \"符文，但火牛人把金子刮走，用来装饰他们的伊米克斯神龛（{@area area 7|125|x}）。门上的伤痕暗示了那里曾经的情况；如果有人能读懂矮人语并成功地进行DC15智力（{@skill Investigation}）检查，就能正确地解释它。每个锁都可以用盗贼的工具和成功的DC20灵巧检查来打开。",
	"The lower lock is trapped. The trap can be spotted with a successful DC 13 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, but it's impossible to disarm or bypass. The trap is triggered if an attempt to pick the lower lock fails by 5 or more, if the wrong key is used in the lock, or if it's opened by any means before the upper lock. The trap causes the metal gantry between the treasury and the forge ({@area area 4|11d|x}) to retract west, leaving a 40-foot gap across the magma. The bridge can be re-extended only by lifting the lever in the corridor from {@area area 4|11d|x}. The lever is too far away to be manipulated with {@spell mage hand} by anyone on the treasury side of the magma river.": "下方的锁被困住了。通过成功的DC13智慧({@skill Perception})检查可以发现这个陷阱，但它不可能被解除或绕过。如果撬动下层锁的尝试失败了5次或更多，如果在锁中使用了错误的钥匙，或者如果在上层锁之前用任何方法打开了它，陷阱就会被触发。该陷阱会使库房和锻造厂之间的金属龙门（{@area area 4|11d|x}）向西缩回，在岩浆上留下一个40英尺的缺口。只有从{@area area 4|11d|x}的走廊上抬起杠杆，才能重新延长桥的长度。杠杆太远了，在岩浆河的金库一侧的人无法用{@spell mage hand}来操纵。",
	"The keys to the treasury were within the firenewts' grasp. However, they failed to recognize the keys for what they were and incorporated them into a statue they built in the shrine of Imix ({@area area 7|125|x}).": "金库的钥匙在火牛们的掌握之中。然而，他们没有认识到钥匙的真面目，而是将其纳入了他们在伊米克斯（{@area area 7|125|x}）的神殿中建造的雕像。",
	"The solution to opening the door lies in a seemingly empty side chamber near the treasury. Anyone searching this room turns up a curious box tossed into the corner. The box is made of iron and resembles a book, and it opens from both sides, rather like the front and back covers of a book. One side bears the dwarven rune for \"beginnings,\" the other bears the rune for \"endings.\" Opening either side reveals the impression of a key in the iron plate. The original keys for the treasury were stored in this box.": "打开这扇门的办法是在靠近金库的一个看似空旷的侧室。任何人在这个房间里搜索，都会发现一个被扔在角落里的好奇的盒子。盒子是铁制的，类似于一本书，它从两边打开，颇像一本书的封面和封底。一边是矮人的 \"开始 \"符文，另一边是 \"结束 \"的符文。打开任何一面，都能看到铁板上的钥匙印记。库房的原始钥匙就存放在这个盒子里。",
	"With all the tools of Hrakhamar at their disposal, copies of both keys can be made from these impressions by a character who has proficiency with smith's tools and who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence check. Sithi Vinecutter has the needed proficiency if none of the characters do. {@creature Musharib|ToA} (see \"{@area Finding a Guide|095|x}\") also has the necessary skill. After three failed checks, the box's impressions are ruined, and the box can no longer be used to mold new keys.": "有了Hrakhamar的所有工具，如果一个精通铁匠工具的角色，并且成功地进行了DC10智力检查，就可以根据这些印记制作出两把钥匙的副本。如果没有一个角色具备所需的熟练度，那么西提-维纳斯特就具备这种能力。{@creature Musharib|ToA}（见\"{@area Finding a Guide|095|x}\"）也有必要的技能。三次检查失败后，盒子的印记就会被毁掉，盒子就不能再用来塑造新的钥匙。",
	"The treasury contains the stockpiled wealth of Hrakhamar. Thousands of iron and adamantine ingots are neatly sorted, stacked, and crated. Each iron ingot is worth 1 gp and weighs 10 pounds.

If she is present, Sithi Vinecutter allows the characters to collect their reward, though she watches them closely to be sure no one takes more than twenty ingots.": "库房里有赫拉卡玛的库存财富。数以千计的铁和金刚砂锭被整齐地分类、堆放和装箱。每块铁锭价值1戈比，重达10磅。每块金刚砂锭价值10戈比，重达1磅。如果她在场，Sithi Vinecutter允许人物领取他们的奖励，尽管她密切关注他们，以确保没有人拿超过20个铁锭。",
	"Resting atop one crate is a gauntlet made of gold and sized for an adult dwarf. The dwarves of Chult call it Moradin's Gauntlet, and it's customarily worn by the overseers of Hrakhamar. It is finely crafted and worth 2,500 gp, though a wealthy dwarf would pay twice that much to acquire it.": "在一个箱子上面放着一个黄金制成的铠甲，大小适合一个成年矮人。楚尔特的矮人称它为 \"莫拉丁之铠\"，赫拉卡玛的监督者们通常都会穿上它。它做工精细，价值2500金币，不过富有的矮人会花两倍的价钱来购买它。",
	"It's unclear what the dwarves used this area for, but the firenewts converted it into a shrine.": "目前还不清楚矮人把这个地方用来做什么，但火纽特人把它改成了一个神殿。",
	"The reek of sulfur and burning flesh assaults your nostrils as the tunnel opens into a small chamber. At the northern end of the room is a five-foot-tall statue made of iron, copper, gold, and silver, crudely hammered together into a form suggesting something vaguely humanoid but also fiery. Four firenewts worship before it.": "当隧道通向一个小房间时，硫磺和烧焦的肉体的恶臭袭击了你的鼻孔。在房间的北端是一个五英尺高的雕像，由铁、铜、金和银制成，粗略地敲打成一个形状，暗示着某种隐约的人形，但也是火的。四个火牛在它面前膜拜。",
	"The worshipers are two {@creature Firenewt Warlock of Imix|VGM|firenewt warlocks of Imix} and two {@creature Firenewt Warrior|VGM|firenewt warriors} (see {@adventure appendix D|ToA|9} for the firenewts' statistics).

	"The statue weighs 150 pounds and represents Imix, the evil, fiery primordial at the center of the firenewts' militarized, theological society. The statue has little artistic merit (firenewts are passable smiths but poor artists). If the gold and silver are separated from the other metals, they're worth 20 gp and 400 sp, respectively. An albino dwarf or a character skilled at smithing could smelt out the valuable metals with the equipment in Hrakhamar in a few hours.": "这座雕像重达150磅，代表Imix，是火牛人军事化神学社会中心的邪恶、火热的原始人。这座雕像没有什么艺术价值（火牛人是合格的铁匠，但艺术家很差）。如果把金和银从其他金属中分离出来，它们分别值20戈比和400斯皮。一个白化矮人或一个精通铁匠技术的人物可以用赫拉卡玛的设备在几个小时内熔炼出有价值的金属。",
	"The size and shape of this area are impossible to determine. Clouds of roiling smoke sting your eyes, and drifting embers burn your throat as you breathe. You can, however, barely make out what looks like a lantern farther back in the smoke.": "这个地区的大小和形状是无法确定的。翻滚的烟云刺痛了你的眼睛，漂浮的余烬在你呼吸时灼烧你的喉咙。然而，你可以勉强看清烟雾中较远处的一个看起来像灯笼的东西。",
	"Firenewts are notorious torturers and eaters of humanoid flesh. Prisoners are tied up, gagged, and tossed here until the firenewts decide how to inflict the most intense and longest-lasting pain on them. Most prisoners are dead within a tenday, but they wish for the end much sooner.": "火蝾螈是臭名昭著的折磨者和人形肉体的食客。囚犯们被捆绑起来，塞住嘴，并被扔在这里，直到火牛决定如何对他们施加最强烈和最持久的痛苦。大多数囚犯在一天之内就死了，但他们希望能更早地结束。",
	"Dwarves are the exception. There's much about the workings of Hrakhamar the firenewts still don't understand.

	"Even more than their deal with {@creature Liara Portyr|ToA}, the pirates' most important asset is this hidden base, and every pirate must swear a blood oath to protect its secret location.

	"Anyone who wanders into the anchorage from the jungle or from the bay is unlikely to be allowed to leave.

	"The roof of the cave looms 60 feet above the water, on average (this varies a bit with the tide). It's 50 feet above ground level and 20 feet above the top of the watch tower and gantry.

	"The pirates' first line of defense is a ring of submerged rocks a quarter-mile from shore. The captain of a ship trying to sail though must make a DC 10 Intelligence check. If the check succeeds, the ship gets past the rocks safely. If it fails by 4 or less, the ship strikes a rock and springs a few leaks but suffers no serious damage and can continue seeking a passage through. If the check fails by 5 or more, a rock causes significant damage; the ship lists badly and its speed is halved until the hull is repaired. Striking a third rock causes the ship to sink. The pirates, of course, know where the rocks are and avoid them.": "海盗们的第一道防线是距离海岸四分之一英里的一圈水下岩石。试图驶过的船只的船长必须进行DC10智力检查。如果检查成功，船就能安全通过岩石。如果失败4次或更少，船就会撞到岩石，并出现一些漏水现象，但不会受到严重损害，可以继续寻求通过的途径。如果检查的结果是5分或更多，那么一块岩石就会造成严重的损坏；船体严重变形，速度减半，直到船体被修复。撞击第三块岩石会使船沉没。海盗们当然知道岩石的位置，并会避开它们。",

	"Elok wants to stop sending a slice of the pirates' profits to Fort Beluarian, which would end the alliance with {@creature Liara Portyr|ToA} and probably be self-defeating; the pirates could keep more of their profit, but they'd take fewer prizes and incur more risk. The other captains see the disadvantages clearly, but Jaharwon is building a following among the rank-and-file pirates of all three crews.": "埃洛克想停止将海盗的一部分利润送到贝卢安堡，这将结束与{@creature Liara Portyr|ToA}的联盟，而且可能会弄巧成拙；海盗可以保留更多的利润，但他们会拿更少的战利品，承担更大的风险。其他船长清楚地看到了这些弊端，但贾哈元正在所有三个船队的普通海盗中建立一个追随者。",

He'd rather seek lost treasures and magic items, but not by digging into ruins and tombs; instead, he'll happily pursue adventurers across jungles and oceans to steal whatever hard-earned plunder he believes they have. His ship, the Stirge, is filled with scoundrels and cutthroats eager to do his dirty work. {@creature Laskilar|ToA} also stays in contact with a host of wealthy patrons in Port Nyanzaru and more distant ports who are eager to pay a king's ransom for the rarest of his ill-gotten gains.": "船长{@creature Laskilar|ToA}(NE男性泰特里亚人{@creature bandit captain}，身穿{@item cape of the mountebank})是一个浮夸、狂妄的海盗，他已经厌倦了追逐商船，听他们的船长抱怨和恳求损失的收入和洒下的鲜血。他宁愿去寻找丢失的宝藏和魔法物品，但不是通过挖掘废墟和坟墓；相反，他会很高兴地在丛林和海洋中追逐冒险者，偷取他认为他们拥有的任何来之不易的掠夺品。他的船 \"Stirge \"号上到处都是渴望为他干脏活累活的无赖和割喉者。{@creature Laskilar|ToA}还与尼安萨鲁港和更远的港口的许多富有的主顾保持联系，他们渴望为他最稀有的不义之财支付国王的赎金。",
	"The narrow strip of land between the cliff and the water is closed off by a 15-foot-high wall made of thick palm logs lashed together with stout vines. Their bottoms are set into the ground, and the whole wall is braced up along the inner side with more palm logs. The wall is meant to keep out undead and dinosaurs. The gates are roughly made but reinforced with iron bands and backed by two heavy wooden bars. The pirates never open these gates without the approval of whichever captain is currently in charge of the anchorage.": "悬崖和水面之间的狭长地带被一堵15英尺高的墙所封闭，这堵墙是用粗大的棕榈木用粗壮的藤蔓捆绑而成。它们的底部镶嵌在地面上，整个墙的内侧用更多的棕榈木支撑起来。这道墙是为了防止亡灵和恐龙进入。大门做得很粗糙，但用铁带加固，并以两根沉重的木条作为支撑。在没有得到目前负责锚地的哪位船长的批准之前，海盗们从不打开这些大门。",

	"Each of the three captains has one of these chambers for his private use. In practice, the captains seldom use them, preferring the comfort and safety of the cabins aboard their own ships. Instead, the use of these private quarters is meted out as a reward to crew members who distinguished themselves on the latest voyage, and as a result, they tend to be squalid and smelly.": "三位舰长中的每一位都有一个这样的房间供其私人使用。实际上，船长们很少使用这些房间，他们更喜欢自己船上的舒适和安全的船舱。相反，这些私人房间的使用是作为对在最近一次航行中表现突出的船员的奖励，因此，这些房间往往是肮脏和发臭的。",

	"The proprietor is {@creature Bosco Daggerhand|ToA} (NE male human {@creature thug} who wears a {@item ring of animal influence}), so called because he never shakes anyone's hand without his other hand resting threateningly on the dagger in his sash.

	"Pirate ships enter and leave this bay as they come and go from Jahaka Anchorage. The River Tath plunges down multiple waterfalls before spilling into the bay, so mist perpetually drifts out of the river mouth and across the bay. This mist isn't especially heavy but its effect accumulates over distance, so it restricts visibility to a few miles on all but the windiest days. The outline of the coastal mountains can be seen from any distance in the bay, but finer details—something the size of a ship or smaller, for example—can't be discerned from more than 2 or 3 miles distant.

Even as guests, they're expected to spend a few hours a day helping with chores (sweeping floors and cleaning dishes, mostly).": "如果这些人物和平地接近，只要他们不伤害任何人，不破坏传统，不偷窃，不撒谎，他们就会在Kir Sabal受到欢迎。即使作为客人，他们也要每天花几个小时帮助做家务（主要是扫地和洗碗）。",
	"If the characters tell {@creature Asharra|ToA} of their plan to visit Omu and destroy the Soulmonger, she offers to perform a ritual called the Dance of the Seven Winds, bestowing on the characters the magical ability to fly (see the \"Dance of the Seven Winds\" sidebar). To complete the ritual, she needs a black orchid, which can be found only in {@area Nangalore|166|x} (described later in this chapter). {@creature Asharra|ToA} can provide directions, but she doesn't allow her people to go anywhere near the ruins because of the evil, intelligent cranes (eblis) known to live there.": "如果人物告诉{@creature Asharra|ToA}他们计划访问Omu并摧毁Soulmonger，她会提议举行一个叫做七风之舞的仪式，赋予人物神奇的飞行能力（见 \"七风之舞 \"侧边栏）。为了完成这个仪式，她需要一朵黑色的兰花，这朵兰花只能在{@area Nangalore|166|x}找到（本章后面有介绍）。{@creature Asharra|ToA}可以提供方向，但她不允许她的人靠近废墟的任何地方，因为已知那里住着邪恶、聪明的鹤（eblis）。",
	"{@creature Asharra|ToA} knows a ritual called the Dance of the Seven Winds, which temporarily grants magical flight to as many as ten nonflying creatures. The ritual, which takes 10 minutes to complete, can only be performed by an aarakocra elder and requires a black orchid as a material component.": "{@creature Asharra|ToA}知道一种叫做 \"七风之舞 \"的仪式，它可以暂时赋予多达10个非飞行生物以魔法飞行。这个仪式需要10分钟才能完成，只能由阿拉科克拉长老来完成，并且需要一朵黑兰花作为材料成分。",
	"{@creature Asharra|ToA} must grind the orchid to powder, inhale it, and dance in circles around the ritual's beneficiaries uninterrupted while seven other aarakocra chant prayers to the Wind Dukes of Aaqa. When the dance concludes, {@creature Asharra|ToA}'s wings disappear and she loses the ability to fly. The ritual's beneficiaries each gain a magical flying speed of 30 feet (allowing them to fly 4 miles per hour). This benefit lasts for 3 days, after which {@creature Asharra|ToA}'s wings reappear and she regains the ability to fly.": "{@creature Asharra|ToA}必须将兰花磨成粉末，吸入它，并在其他七个阿拉科克拉向Aaqa的风公爵祈祷时，不间断地绕着仪式的受益者转圈跳舞。当舞蹈结束时，{@creature Asharra|ToA}的翅膀会消失，她会失去飞行的能力。仪式的受益者每人获得30英尺的神奇飞行速度（允许他们每小时飞行4英里）。这个好处持续3天，之后{@creature Asharra|ToA}的翅膀重新出现，她重新获得了飞行能力。",
	"Mwaxanaré is vain, headstrong, and impatient to claim her throne. She doesn't take kindly to backtalk and is unaccustomed to speaking to anyone except {@creature Asharra|ToA} without condescension. In her view, she's already Queen of Chult; the rest of the world is at fault for not acknowledging that.": "姆瓦克萨纳雷虚荣心强，刚愎自用，不耐烦地要求自己的王位。她不喜欢顶嘴，不习惯对任何人说话，除了{@creature Asharra|ToA}，不喜欢居高临下。在她看来，她已经是楚尔特的女王了；世界上的其他人不承认这一点，是他们的错。",
	"Mwaxanaré believes she can garner widespread support to repopulate and rebuild Omu by retrieving a symbolically significant yet long-lost treasure called the Skull Chalice of Ch'gakare (see {@area chapter 5|4c3|x}). If the characters claim to be headed to Omu, she urges them to find the chalice and return it to her \"for the good of Chult.\" If the characters request something more substantial as a reward, she offers them 250 gp worth of choice pieces from her private treasury (see {@area area 5|154|x}).": "Mwaxanaré认为她可以获得广泛的支持，通过找回一个具有象征意义但长期丢失的宝物--Ch'gakare的骷髅杯（见{@area chapter 5|4c3|x}）来重新安置和重建奥姆。如果人物声称要去奥姆，她会敦促他们找到圣杯并把它还给她，\"为了楚尔特的利益\"。如果人物要求更多的东西作为奖励，她会从她的私人宝库中提供价值250金币的精选物品（见{@area area 5|154|x}）。",
	"Although the aarakocra treat her well, Mwaxanaré is lonely; the only other human in Kir Sabal is her brother. Consequently, the princess is likely to fixate on one of the adventurers as a potential romantic partner. This attachment will be powerful, fiery, and jealous, and Mwaxanaré is accustomed to getting everything she wants.": "虽然Aarakocra对她很好，但Mwaxanaré很孤独；在Kir Sabal唯一的其他人类是她的兄弟。因此，公主很可能会把一个冒险家当作潜在的浪漫伴侣来看待。这种依恋将是强大的、火热的、嫉妒的，而姆瓦克萨娜瑞习惯于得到她想要的一切。",
	"Against {@creature Asharra|ToA}'s wishes, the princess forged a pact with the Wind Dukes of Aaqa, ancient beings of the Outer Planes, to become a fledgling warlock. She detests physical labor and puts her {@spell mage hand} and {@spell unseen servant} spells to constant use. Through her pact, she has also gained telepathy, which she enjoys using.": "违背{@creature Asharra|ToA}的意愿，公主与Aaqa的风公爵--外星的古老生物--签订了契约，成为一名初出茅庐的术士。她厌恶体力劳动，并不断使用她的（1%）和（2%）法术。通过她的契约，她还获得了心灵感应，她很喜欢使用这种方法。",
	"If {@creature Asharra|ToA} suspects that Mwaxanaré might learn disturbing or inconvenient truths about the world from the characters, or that her passion for one of them might lead to tragedy, they become a dangerous presence in {@creature Asharra|ToA}'s eyes—and Kir Sabal is a precarious place for creatures without wings.": "如果{@creature Asharra|ToA}怀疑Mwaxanaré可能会从这些人物身上了解到令人不安或不方便的世界真相，或者她对其中一个人的热情可能会导致悲剧的发生，那么在{@creature Asharra|ToA}的眼中，他们就成了危险的存在--而对于没有翅膀的生物来说，Kir Sabal是个不稳定的地方。",
	"{@creature Na|ToA} wears an aarakocra costume he made himself and pretends to be one of the bird folk. He is uncommonly studious and bookish for a six-year-old boy. He is polite, deferential, and speaks softly with a wisdom beyond his meager years. His only outdoor interests are walking among the gardens atop the plateau, where he studies plants and insects, and launching complex flying toys made of wood and folded paper out the window of his room and watching them glide lazily across the jungle. {@creature Na|ToA} would laugh, and then be aghast, if anyone suggested he would make a better monarch than Mwaxanaré.": "{@creature Na|ToA}穿着他自己制作的阿拉科拉服装，假装是鸟人中的一员。对于一个六岁的男孩来说，他是不寻常的好学和爱读书。他彬彬有礼，恭敬有加，说话轻声细语，有着超出其年龄的智慧。他唯一的户外兴趣是在高原上的花园中散步，在那里他研究植物和昆虫，以及在他房间的窗户上发射由木头和折叠纸制成的复杂飞行玩具，看着它们在丛林中懒洋洋地滑行。如果有人说他会成为比姆瓦克萨纳雷更好的君主，{@creature Na|ToA}会大笑，然后大惊失色。",
	"The gargoyles of Omu and the aarakocra of Kir Sabal are bitter enemies. Aarakocra scouts watch over the distant city, and their brazen intrusion annoys the gargoyles. Once in a while, gargoyles follow a patrol back to Kir Sabal and attack the monastery. If this happens while the characters are visiting Kir Sabal, the aarakocra appreciate whatever help the party can provide. The attacking force consists of ten gargoyles. If six or more are slain, the rest fly back to Omu.": "奥姆的夜行神龙和基尔萨巴尔的Aarakocra是死敌。Aarakocra侦察兵监视着远方的城市，他们厚颜无耻的入侵让石像鬼们很不爽。偶尔，夜行神龙会跟随巡逻队回到Kir Sabal，并攻击寺院。如果这种情况发生在人物访问Kir Sabal的时候，arakocra就会感谢党所能提供的任何帮助。攻击部队由十只巨妖组成。如果有六个或更多的人被杀，剩下的人就会飞回奥木。",
	"A large, circular labyrinth symbol of Ubtao is painted on the face of this building, but it can't be seen from anywhere in Kir Sabal; it's visible only from the air or from the ground below.": "这座建筑的表面上画着一个巨大的、圆形的乌布托的迷宫符号，但从基尔萨巴尔的任何地方都看不到它；只有从空中或下面的地面上才能看到它。",
	"The entrance hall of the monastery is also the dining chamber. The aarakocra monks take all their meals here, but it's also where meetings take place. The aarakocra use backless benches and stools for seats, to accommodate their wings. The table can seat twenty.": "寺院的入口大厅也是用餐室。aarakocra僧侣在这里进餐，但这里也是开会的地方。aarakocra使用无背长椅和凳子作为座位，以适应他们的翅膀。这张桌子可以容纳20人。",
	"This is the main hall of the monastery, and it's an impressive sight. The rafters of the ceiling are fully 60 feet above the floor, and the peak of the thatched roof is 15 feet above that. The space is large enough that aarakocra can fly inside it, though they seldom do for the sake of decorum.": "这是寺院的主厅，让人印象深刻。天花板的椽子离地面足有60英尺高，而茅草屋顶的顶峰比它高出15英尺。这个空间足够大，阿拉科克拉可以在里面飞行，尽管出于礼仪的考虑，他们很少这样做。",
	"The circular labyrinth symbol of Ubtao is laid out on a floor mosaic 25 feet in diameter. The aarakocra monks spend much of their days meditating while viewing the labyrinth from the lower and upper landings of the staircase. Other aarakocra come here only on special occasions such as weddings, funerals, and holy days.": "Ubtao的圆形迷宫符号被铺设在直径25英尺的地板马赛克上。aarakocra僧侣们每天大部分时间都在冥想，同时从楼梯的下层和上层观看迷宫。其他arakocra只有在特殊场合才会来这里，如婚礼、葬礼和神圣的日子。",

	"The upper chamber contains a wooden case with shelves of candles and head scarves for visitors to the monastery. At the east end of the chamber is a 5-foot-tall wooden statue with flowers and offerings of food placed at its feet. The statue is obviously very old, and it's worn almost smooth by thousands of hands brushing against it, so it's impossible to determine what it originally portrayed. Offerings left here are picked up daily by {@creature Asharra|ToA}'s servant and placed on the statues in the monastery or the elder's house.": "上室有一个木箱，里面放着供寺院游客使用的蜡烛和头巾的架子。在密室的东端有一尊5英尺高的木制雕像，脚下放着鲜花和供品。这座雕像显然已经非常古老了，它被成千上万只手刷得几乎光滑，所以无法确定它最初描绘的是什么。留在这里的供品每天由{@creature Asharra|ToA}的仆人拾起，放在寺院或长老家的雕像上。",
	"{@creature Asharra|ToA} and an elderly female {@creature aarakocra} servant named Yingmatona (pronounced ying-mah-TOE-nah) live in this grand structure. No other aarakocra ever set foot inside.

	"The outer room is a library with a single bookcase holding forty-four ancient books. {@creature Na|ToA} likes to come here and read the books, none of which is magical. They cover most areas of knowledge: mathematics, natural philosophy, geography, fabulous creatures, theology, and so forth. All the books predate the Spellplague, so little useful information about Chult can be gleaned from them.": "外间是一个图书馆，一个书架上放着四十四本古书。{@creature Na|ToA}喜欢来这里读这些书，其中没有一本是神奇的。它们涵盖了大部分的知识领域：数学、自然哲学、地理、神话般的生物、神学等等。所有的书都是在法术瘟疫之前的，所以从这些书中可以收集到的关于丘特的有用信息很少。",
	"The dwellings in Kir Sabal aren't all identical, but they're similar enough. Each is occupied by {@dice 2d4} {@creature aarakocra}.

	"Mwaxanaré has many beautiful trinkets: silver brushes and mirrors, crystal perfume bottles, writing quills made from multicolored parrot feathers, jewels for braiding into her hair, necklaces and rings set with fiery Chultan opals and amber. All together, these are worth 330 gp, but to be caught in Kir Sabal with items stolen from Mwaxanaré means death—and since no one in Kir Sabal would ever steal, suspicion automatically falls on the characters if anything disappears.": "Mwaxanaré有很多漂亮的饰品：银色的刷子和镜子，水晶香水瓶，用五颜六色的鹦鹉羽毛做成的写字笔，编在头发上的珠宝，镶嵌着火红的Chultan蛋白石和琥珀的项链和戒指。这些东西加起来价值330戈比，但如果在基尔萨巴尔被抓到携带从姆瓦克萨纳雷偷来的物品，就意味着死亡--因为在基尔萨巴尔没有人会去偷东西，如果有什么东西消失了，嫌疑就会自动落在人物身上。",
	"The River Olung pours into this shallow bay named after Ilyber Kitcher, a pompous Cormyrean explorer who claimed to have discovered it a few centuries ago. He did no such thing, of course; the inlet's existence and location were well known before Kitcher missed the Bay of Chult (he was a terrible navigator) and unknowingly sailed down the peninsula's eastern coast before a storm blew him back within sight of land. There is nothing remarkable about the inlet, other than it provides access to the ruins of Port Castigliar and Mezro.": "奥隆河涌入这个浅水湾，以伊里伯-基彻的名字命名，他是一个自大的科米尔探险家，声称在几个世纪前发现了这个海湾。当然，他并没有这样做；在基特尔错过楚尔特湾（他是个糟糕的航海家）之前，这个海湾的存在和位置是众所周知的，他在不知情的情况下沿着半岛的东海岸航行，然后被风暴吹回陆地的视线内。除了提供通往卡斯蒂利亚港和梅斯罗废墟的通道外，这个入海口并没有什么了不起的地方。",
	"This lake sits above an immense geothermal sink, where it's heated by volcanic vents and by lava streaming down from the Valley of Embers. Portions of the lake are actually boiling, sending up clouds of steam that can be seen for miles. The water is too hot and too alkaline for fish or any other type of aquatic life to survive in it, and the shore around the lake is a dead wasteland of ash and salt flats. Aside from mud mephits and steam mephits, few creatures thrive in the area. The water cools and loses most of its alkalinity as it flows north along the River Olung.": "这个湖位于一个巨大的地热槽之上，它被火山口和从余烬谷流下的熔岩所加热。湖的一部分实际上正在沸腾，喷出的蒸汽云在几英里外都能看到。水温太高，碱性太强，鱼类或其他类型的水生生物无法在其中生存，湖周围的海岸是一片死寂的灰烬和盐滩。除了泥头鱼和蒸汽头鱼外，很少有生物在该地区繁衍。当水沿着奥隆河向北流去时，水会变冷并失去大部分的碱性。",
	"This hellish, smoky sea of black volcanic rock is traced with streams of lava. The Land of Ash and Smoke is a playground for firenewts and for Tzindelor, a young red dragon (see \"{@area Wyrmheart Mine|1af|x}\"), who likes to bathe in the lava streams. This gray, barren valley is typically 20 to 40 degrees hotter than anywhere else in Chult. It receives only a fraction of the rain that falls on the rest of the peninsula, and what rain does fall rapidly evaporates in the punishing heat. Several expeditions have tried to explore the area, but most of what's known about it (and shown on {@creature Syndra Silvane|ToA}'s map) is based on visual observations made from atop the coastal mountains.": "这片由黑色火山岩组成的地狱般的烟海被熔岩流所覆盖。灰烬和烟雾之地是火牛的乐园，也是年轻的红龙Tzindelor的乐园（见\"{@area Wyrmheart Mine|1af|x}\"），他喜欢在熔岩流中洗澡。这个灰色的贫瘠山谷通常比楚尔特的其他地方要热20到40度。这里的降雨量只有半岛其他地方的一小部分，而降下的雨水也会在酷热中迅速蒸发掉。有几支探险队曾试图探索该地区，但人们对它的了解（以及在{@creature Syndra Silvane|ToA}地图上的显示）大多是基于从沿海山顶上的视觉观察。",

	"The path is a much easier route to the top. It begins on the north side of the plateau. Through many switchbacks, it winds across the cliff face for 3 miles before reaching the top. The path width varies but averages 5 feet. Tumbled boulders and tangled roots block the path in many places, but as long as characters aren't being chased by anything, they can clear the obstructions safely. The first ascent takes 3 hours; once the road is cleared, it can be climbed or descended in half that time.": "这条路是通往山顶的一条更容易的路线。它开始于高原的北侧。通过许多弯道，在到达山顶之前，它在悬崖面上蜿蜒了3英里。这条路的宽度各不相同，但平均为5英尺。在许多地方，翻滚的巨石和缠结的树根挡住了道路，但只要人物没有被什么东西追赶，他们就能安全地清除障碍物。第一次上山需要3个小时；一旦道路被清理干净，可以在一半的时间内爬上或下山。",
	"As the characters climb ever higher above the tree line, they are treated to stunning views of the surrounding wilderness. Across the Aldani Basin to the southeast, they can see the Heart of Ubtao, and nestled in the jungle to the west is the ziggurat at Orolunga. Characters who succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check also spot some sort of shipwreck in the jungle, beyond the plateaus to the south (see \"{@area Wreck of the Star Goddess|1aa|x}\").": "随着人物在树线上爬得越来越高，他们看到了周围荒野的迷人景色。穿过东南方向的阿尔达尼盆地，他们可以看到乌布托之心，而西边的丛林中依偎着奥罗伦加的金字塔。通过DC20智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查成功的人物还可以在丛林中发现某种沉船，在南部的高原之外（见\"{@area Wreck of the Star Goddess|1aa|x}\"）。",
	"About a hundred feet below the lip of the plateau, the path (which is proceeding west across the cliff at that point) veers directly into a natural cleft in the stone face. Steps are cut into the 15-foot-wide crevice, and scenes of jungle predators, flying lizards, and erupting volcanoes are carved in shallow relief onto the walls in ways that make creative use of the natural shape of the rock. When the characters reach the top of the steps, read:": "在高原唇部以下约100英尺处，道路（此时正向西穿过悬崖）直接转向石面上的一个天然裂缝。在15英尺宽的裂缝中开出了台阶，丛林掠食者、飞翔的蜥蜴和喷发的火山等场景被以浅浮雕的方式刻在墙上，创造性地利用了岩石的自然形状。当人物到达台阶的顶部时，请阅读。",
	"The stone steps emerge onto the top of the plateau beneath a once grand, but now decrepit wooden gateway.

Evidence of a wooden palisade can be seen, but it, too, is almost entirely gone or fallen over.": "要走下台阶，人物必须涉过成堆的头骨，或者爬过楼梯的两侧，绕过大门。可以看到木制围墙的证据，但它也几乎完全消失或倒塌了。",
	"Mbala was once the seat of a small kingdom. Most of the structures were wood and thatch, and they're now just crumbling compost heaps demolished by rain, wind, and time. A few stone foundations and overgrown ramps poke up through the debris, indicating this was more than just a simple village.": "姆巴拉曾经是一个小王国的所在地。大多数建筑都是木头和茅草，现在它们只是摇摇欲坠的堆肥，被雨水、风和时间拆毁了。一些石头地基和杂草丛生的坡道从废墟中探出头来，表明这里不仅仅是一个简单的村庄。",
	"If the characters explore the ruins of Mbala, read:": "如果人物探索姆巴拉的废墟，请阅读。",
	"The only structure still intact is a lone hut about a thousand yards southwest of the gate, at the edge of a boulder field.

She claims that all the other villagers were killed over the course of many years by winged creatures that live on the south side of the plateau.

If characters are unwilling to sacrifice one of their own to save a fallen comrade, {@creature Nanny Pu'pu|ToA} recommends they capture a goblin, a grung, or other humanoid and bring it to her. {@creature Nanny Pu'pu|ToA} kills the sacrifice, captures its spirit in the gemstone, and magically embeds the stone in the dead humanoid's forehead. After {@creature Nanny Pu'pu|ToA} speaks a prayer to Myrkul, the spirit of the sacrifice gains the knowledge and the personality of the humanoid to which it is bound, in effect imitating that humanoid's spirit. When the ritual is complete, the dead humanoid awakens as if from a deep slumber, though it is not alive.": "{@creature Nanny Pu'pu|ToA}是Chult唯一可以进行 \"偷盗生命仪式 \"的生物。这个仪式需要1小时才能完成，需要三样东西：一具基本完整的人形尸体，一块价值至少100金币的宝石，以及最令人不安的，另一个人形的牺牲。如果角色不愿意牺牲自己人去拯救死去的同伴，{@creature Nanny Pu'pu|ToA}建议他们抓一个地精、格伦或其他人形生物并把它带到她面前。{@creature Nanny Pu'pu|ToA}杀死祭品，把它的灵魂捕捉到宝石中，然后用魔法把宝石嵌入死去的人形生物的额头中。在{@creature Nanny Pu'pu|ToA}对Myrkul说了一段祈祷词后，祭品的灵魂获得了它所绑定的人形生物的知识和个性，实际上是模仿了那个人形生物的灵魂。仪式完成后，死去的人形生物会像从沉睡中醒来，尽管它并不活着。",

It contains six onyx gemstones (50 gp each), a {@item spell scroll} of {@spell comprehend languages}, and ten adamantine ingots (10 gp each) stamped with dwarven runes.

	"Nothing about this Chultan city is what it seems. By all accounts, Mezro was destroyed by the Spellplague, and its ruins indicate as much. In truth, the city's immortal defenders—the barae—used their god-given magic to transport the entire city to a paradise (a magically constructed demiplane, far from prying eyes). Empty ruins were left behind to create the impression that Mezro had been destroyed. It is not known if and when the Mezroans and their city will return.": "这座Chultan城市没有任何东西是它所看起来的。从各方面来看，Mezro是被法术瘟疫摧毁的，它的废墟也表明了这一点。事实上，这座城市的不朽保卫者--巴拉--利用他们的神赐魔法将整个城市传送到一个天堂（一个用魔法建造的半位面，远离窥探的目光）。空荡荡的废墟被留下，以造成Mezro已经被摧毁的印象。目前还不知道梅斯罗人和他们的城市是否以及何时会回来。",

	"Artus won't endanger the Mezroans by revealing the truth about their city. Although the {@item Ring of Winter|ToA} makes him immortal, he has grown impatient in the intervening years and longs for Alisanda's return.

When he's not at the ruins, he's searching the jungles of Chult for Orolunga, another ruined city, in the hopes of consulting with a prescient guardian naga believed to dwell there.": "阿图斯不会因为揭示他们城市的真相而危及梅斯罗人。虽然{@item Ring of Winter|ToA}使他不朽，但在这几年中他已经变得不耐烦了，渴望阿利桑达的回归。他时不时地访问废墟，看看有什么变化，如果有的话。当他不在废墟时，他就在楚尔特的丛林中寻找另一个废墟城市奥罗伦加，希望能与据说居住在那里的先知先觉的守护纳迦商量。",
	"The ruins that were left behind form a circle. Four main avenues to the north, south, east, and west meet at a central plaza.

Ka-Nanji was a palatial retreat from the intrigues and pressures of Omu, and the beautiful, tiered garden was praised as a worthy tribute to the queen.": "这个大花园（地图2.12）是为了纪念虚荣的奥穆安女王Zalkoré而建造的。它的建造者Thiru-taya是Zalkoré最重要的将军和妃子。在他们的时代，这个花园被称为Ka-Nanji，即梦想的悬空花园。Ka-Nanji是一个远离奥穆的阴谋和压力的宫殿式隐居地，这个美丽的分层花园被赞誉为对女王当之无愧的致敬。",
	"Unceasing flattery festered with poisonous vanity in Zalkoré's mind until she bargained with an erinyes to retain her youth and beauty forever.

	"Believing that Thiru-taya was among the generals who exiled her, Zalkoré defaced all the statues and portraits of him in Nangalore. She learned he had stayed true to her all his life, through decades of imprisonment and disgrace in Omu, only when his ashes were brought to the garden for interment, as was his dying wish. Zalkoré cultivates hallucinogenic plants in the garden, because only in their narcotic, lotus dreams can she conjure up the face of her dead love.": "扎尔科雷相信Thiru-taya也是流放她的将军之一，于是污损了他在Nangalore的所有雕像和肖像。她了解到他一生都对她不离不弃，经历了几十年的监禁和在奥姆的耻辱，只有在他的骨灰被带到花园安葬时，才知道他的骨灰是按照他的遗愿。扎尔科雷在花园里种植了致幻植物，因为只有在它们的麻醉下，在莲花的梦中，她才能幻化出她死去的爱人的脸。",

	"Stone steps ascend along the curved wall to the level of a second floor, but that floor is almost entirely collapsed. Someone's been up there, however, because a message of some sort is scrawled across the domed ceiling.": "石阶沿着弯曲的墙壁上升到二楼的水平，但那层楼几乎完全坍塌了。不过，有人曾在上面呆过，因为圆顶天花板上写着某种信息。",
	"When it was intact, the second floor was actually a mezzanine that wrapped around three sides of the dome. The head, chest, and shoulders of the warrior statue rose above the mezzanine level.": "当它完好无损时，第二层实际上是一个夹层，包裹着穹顶的三面。战士雕像的头部、胸部和肩部都高于夹层。",

Three eblis move to Zalkoré's lair ({@adventure area 8|ToA|2|8. Zalkoré's Lair}), while the others take up positions in trees, on walls, or on rooftops.

	"At the center of the room, a long divan stands atop a circular dais. Reclining on the divan is a woman dressed in a flowing robe made from parrot feathers in stunning colors. Despite the heat, her arms, head, and face are covered in feathery veils. Next to her, a black orchid grows out of a large clay pot at the head of the divan. She addresses you in a voice tinged with odd inflections. \"Strangers have come to Nangalore, my love. What boon do our subjects beseech?\"": "在房间的中央，一张长长的神桌矗立在一个圆形的台子上。躺在长椅上的是一位身着由鹦鹉羽毛制成的飘逸长袍的妇女，其颜色令人惊叹。尽管天气炎热，她的手臂、头和脸都被羽毛状的面纱所覆盖。在她身旁，一株黑色的兰花从神龛前的一个大陶罐中生长出来。她用一种带着古怪语气的声音对你说话。\"陌生人来到Nangalore，我的爱人。我们的臣民请求什么恩惠？\"",
	"The {@creature medusa} isn't completely insane, but thanks to her plant extract, she continually hallucinates that Thiru-taya is standing at her side. Most of Zalkoré's comments include him somehow; try to make these references as puzzling as possible for the characters. She also believes that she's still queen of Omu while simultaneously remembering and understanding that she was exiled here. She can make contradictory statements about herself and her past without any apparent cognitive dissonance.": "{@creature medusa}并没有完全疯掉，但由于她的植物提取物，她不断产生幻觉，认为Thiru-taya就站在她身边。扎尔科雷的大部分评论都以某种方式包含了他；尽量让这些参考资料让人物感到费解。她还认为自己仍然是奥木的女王，同时又记得并理解她曾被流放到这里。她可以对自己和自己的过去做出矛盾的陈述，而没有任何明显的认知障碍。",

	"The first time someone makes a disparaging remark about Thiru-taya or refers to his \"betrayal,\" they draw a furious response from Zalkoré, but she recomposes herself. If it happens a second time, a battle is assured.": "第一次有人对Thiru-taya说三道四，或提到他的 \"背叛\"，就会引来Zalkoré的愤怒回应，但她会重新调整自己。如果再发生第二次，肯定会有一场战斗。",
	"If someone snatches away Zalkoré's veil, makes a grab for the black orchid, or brings out a mirror, their fate is sealed. If someone asks why she wears a veil, Zalkoré replies that she no longer desires to show her face to anyone but her beloved Thiru-taya.": "如果有人抢走了Zalkoré的面纱，抢走了黑兰花，或者拿出了镜子，他们的命运就注定了。如果有人问她为什么戴面纱，扎尔科雷回答说，除了她心爱的Thiru-taya之外，她不再希望向任何人展示她的脸。",
	"As long as the meeting remains cordial, Zalkoré can reveal much about Omu. She can direct characters to its general location (\"between the fire peaks and the great iron mine of the dwarves\") and warns them that yuan-ti covet the city. She knows nothing about the Soulmonger or the death curse. She's heard that at least one of her descendants is in hiding with the bird folk of Kir Sabal, awaiting the restoration of the monarchy. (These are examples of how Zalkoré simultaneously thinks of herself as still the ruling queen of Omu as it was centuries ago, and is also aware the city has fallen and she's in exile. Both situations coexist in her hallucinatory reality.)": "只要会面保持友好，扎尔科雷就能透露很多关于奥姆的信息。她可以指引人物到它的大致位置（\"在火峰和矮人的大铁矿之间\"），并警告他们元帝觊觎这座城市。她对 \"灵魂使者 \"和死亡诅咒一无所知。她听说她至少有一个后裔躲在基尔萨巴尔的鸟人那里，等待着君主制的恢复。(这些例子说明扎尔科雷同时认为自己仍然是几个世纪前的奥姆的统治者，同时也意识到这个城市已经沦陷，她在流亡。这两种情况在她的幻觉现实中并存）。",
	"Characters in search of a black orchid for {@creature Asharra|ToA}'s ritual (see \"{@area Kir Sabal|13f|x}\") find one here, but Zalkoré won't part with it unless the characters offer her something of equal beauty. As payment, she demands a gemstone, a piece of jewelry, or an art object worth at least 500 gp. (She won't accept lesser quality goods of equal value.) Zalkoré is also attracted to characters with a Charisma of 16 or higher and will accept one such character as a slave in exchange for the flower. The black orchid in Zalkoré's possession is the only one to be found in Nangalore.": "为{@creature Asharra|ToA}的仪式寻找黑兰花的角色（见\"{@area Kir Sabal|13f|x}\"）在这里找到了一朵，但扎克雷不会放弃它，除非角色提供给她同样美丽的东西。作为报酬，她需要一块宝石、一件珠宝或一件价值至少500gp的艺术品。(她不接受同等价值的低质量物品。）Zalkoré也被魅力值在16以上的人物所吸引，并且会接受一个这样的人物作为奴隶来换取这朵花。Zalkoré所拥有的黑兰花是在Nangalore发现的唯一一朵。",
	"Most of what remains in Zalkoré's lair has little value. Her feathered dress is worth 50 gp, if it wasn't too damaged in the fight (the dress is ruined if more than half the damage done to Zalkoré was slashing, acid, or fire damage, or if she was hit by a {@spell fireball} or similar effect). Her lair contains {@dice 2d6} vials of her dreaming tincture. Each vial contains a single dose and can be sold for 10 gp in Port Nyanzaru. Any character that drinks a dose of the tincture must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Characters who are immune to the {@condition poisoned} condition succeed automatically. On a failed save, the character begins to experience illusory sights, sounds, smells, and sensations that seem real. Casting a {@spell lesser restoration} spell or similar magic on the character ends the effect, which otherwise lasts for {@dice 1d4 + 4} hours.": "Zalkoré巢穴里的大部分东西都没有什么价值。如果她的羽绒服在战斗中没有受到太多损坏的话，那么它的价值是50戈比（如果对扎尔科雷造成的伤害有一半以上是砍伤、酸或火的伤害，或者她被{@spell fireball}或类似的效果击中的话，那么这件衣服就毁了）。她的巢穴里有{@dice 2d6}小瓶的她的梦境酊剂。每瓶包含一个剂量，可以在尼安扎鲁港以10戈比出售。任何喝下一剂酊剂的角色都必须在DC15体质测试中获得成功。对{@condition poisoned}条件免疫的角色会自动成功。拯救失败后，角色开始体验虚幻的视觉、听觉、嗅觉和感觉，似乎是真实的。对该角色施展{@spell lesser restoration}法术或类似的魔法会结束该效果，否则会持续{@dice 1d4 + 4}小时。",
	"A wide sinkhole yawns before you, the earth around it littered with goblin bones. The opening is 90 feet across and roughly circular, and the stone walls are nearly vertical.

	"The massive rib cage and fine wing bones of a dragon rise above the murk. Vines, moss, and lichen hang from the bones. Judging from how much of the skeleton is exposed, the water can't be more than 3 or 4 feet deep.": "龙的巨大肋骨和细小的翼骨耸立在阴暗处。骨头上挂着藤蔓、苔藓和地衣。从骨架暴露的程度来看，水不可能超过3或4英尺深。",
	"The walls of the sinkhole are rough and draped with dozens of stout vines, so climbing into or out of the grotto is easy and automatically successful.": "天坑的墙壁很粗糙，上面垂挂着几十根粗壮的藤蔓，所以爬进或爬出石窟很容易，而且自动成功。",
	"The bones are the remains of Ormalagos, an adult green dragon better known during her lifetime as Needle. She used this grotto as a lair but feared Batiri goblins had sniffed out its location and were getting ready to raid it. Needle was in the process of moving her treasure to other locations when the goblins struck. While the dragon was away, they dumped baskets full of quippers into the sinkhole. When the dragon returned, they trapped her in the sinkhole with vine nets. As the quippers devoured the dragon from below, the Batiri showered Needle with spears from above until she finally died. Nearly the entire goblin tribe perished in the fight, too.": "这些骨头是奥玛拉戈斯的遗骸，她是一条成年绿龙，生前被称为 \"针\"。她把这个石窟当作巢穴，但她担心巴蒂里妖精已经嗅到了它的位置，并准备突袭它。妖精们来袭时，针锋相对地将她的财宝转移到其他地方。当龙不在的时候，他们把装满奎尔人的篮子倒进天坑。当龙回来时，他们用藤蔓网把她困在天坑里。当奎尔人从下面吞噬巨龙的时候，巴蒂里人从上面用长矛向尼德尔射击，直到她最终死亡。几乎整个地精部落也在这场战斗中丧生。",
	"A 10-foot-wide, 10-foot-high secret door in the northwest wall of the grotto conceals a 15-foot-deep alcove. The secret door is carved from natural rock and disguised to look like part of the wall, and all the plants around it are dead. The secret door can be detected with a successful DC 17 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. Characters who inspect the plants around the door and succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) or DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check can tell that the plants were killed by poison. Needle opened the secret door by breathing poison gas on it; smearing or spraying poison on the door also causes it to swing open. Otherwise, a {@spell knock} spell or similar magic is needed to open it.": "在石窟的西北墙上有一个10英尺宽、10英尺高的秘密门，隐藏着一个15英尺深的凹洞。密门由天然岩石雕刻而成，伪装成墙壁的一部分，周围的植物都已死亡。只要成功地进行DC17智慧({@skill Perception})检查，就能发现这扇密门。检查门周围的植物并成功通过DC15智力（{@skill Investigation}）或DC15智慧（{@skill Medicine}）检查的人物可以知道这些植物是被毒死的。针刺通过在门上呼吸毒气打开了密门；在门上涂抹或喷洒毒药也会使它摇晃着打开。否则，需要用{@spell knock}的法术或类似的魔法来打开它。",
	"This vast tract of jungle was ravaged by blight long ago and never recovered. The plants here are sickly and poisonous. In the heart of this wasteland is the ruined palace of the warlord {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA}: a crumbled stone fortress that once stood on the backs of a dozen giant undead turtles. Its destruction by {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA}'s rampaging undead was so complete that nothing remains of this once-awesome structure except the crushed shells and bleached bones of the turtles, and heaps of stone so jumbled that not even the outlines of the ancient walls can be picked out, slowly sinking into the muck. The chance for a random encounter is doubled in this region.": "这片广袤的丛林很久以前就被枯萎病破坏了，再也没有恢复过来。这里的植物都是病态的、有毒的。在这片荒地的中心，是军阀{@creature Ras Nsi|ToA}的废墟宫殿：一座摇摇欲坠的石头堡垒，曾经矗立在十几只巨大的亡灵龟背上。它被{@creature Ras Nsi|ToA}横冲直撞的亡灵破坏得如此彻底，以至于除了海龟的碎壳和漂白的骨头，以及一堆乱七八糟的石头，甚至连古代城墙的轮廓都挑不出来，慢慢地沉入淤泥中，这个曾经令人敬畏的建筑什么都没留下。在这个地区，随机遇到的机会是加倍的。",
	"A massive brick and stone ziggurat rises from the jungle. Two staircases angle up and across the front face, one from the right, the other from the left, to meet at a landing on the second level 30 feet above your heads. That layout repeats on the second level, and the third level, but with each successive layer adding less height than the one below it. The fourth level, 60 feet above the jungle floor, is an enclosed shrine or temple, its walls adorned with labyrinth symbols.": "一座巨大的砖石结构的紫金塔从丛林中升起。两个楼梯从正面向上倾斜，一个从右边，另一个从左边，在你们头顶30英尺处的第二层落地处相遇。这种布局在第二层和第三层重复，但每一层增加的高度都比下面一层少。第四层比丛林地面高60英尺，是一个封闭的神殿或庙宇，墙上装饰着迷宫的符号。",
	"The jungle encroaches right up to and onto this ancient structure. The first flights of steps are choked with creepers, tree roots, and flowering vines. It might have been surrounded by a city long ago, but the jungle is so dense that it would take hours of searching to find buried foundations and tumbled stones.": "丛林直接侵占了这座古老的建筑。第一层台阶被爬山虎、树根和开花的藤蔓所堵塞。它可能在很久以前就被一座城市所包围，但丛林是如此的茂密，以至于要花几个小时的时间来寻找被埋葬的地基和翻滚的石头。",
	"The ziggurat is encased in magic, which becomes obvious if anyone casts {@spell detect magic}. This protective shell prevents anyone from ascending the ziggurat by any means other than climbing the stairs. Characters who try to fly up rise above the trees but never get any closer to the ziggurat, as if they're flying into a powerful headwind they can't detect. Those who try to climb a wall get halfway up, then inexplicably loses their grip and slide back down. A ladder built to scale a wall never reaches the top, no matter how long the ladder. A rope-and-hook thrown up to catch the edge always falls short. Casting {@spell teleport} or {@spell misty step} moves the caster sideways instead of up to the next level. Bypassing the tests by any means is flat-out impossible. It might help to think of the whole situation as a fairy tale; it doesn't need to make sense, because the magic of Orolunga is on a mythic scale that overpowers the ability of any mortal.": "金字塔被魔法包裹着，如果有人施展{@spell detect magic}就会变得很明显。这个保护壳使任何人都无法通过爬楼梯以外的任何方式登上金字塔。试图飞上去的人物会飞到树的上方，但却无法接近金字塔，就像他们飞到了一个他们无法察觉的强大逆风中。那些试图爬墙的人爬到一半，然后莫名其妙地失去了抓力，又滑了下来。为了爬墙而搭建的梯子，无论梯子有多长，都无法到达墙顶。为了抓住边缘而抛出的绳索和钩子总是落空。投掷{@spell teleport}或{@spell misty step}使投掷者向侧面移动，而不是向上移动到下一层。以任何方式绕过测试是完全不可能的。把整个情况想象成一个童话故事可能会有帮助；它不需要有意义，因为奥罗隆加的魔法是在一个神话般的规模上，超过了任何凡人的能力。",
	"The steps from the ground to level 1 of the ziggurat are 50 feet long and rise 30 feet. A tangle of roots, vines, and creepers covers the steps. Characters can climb the first 10 feet as {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. After 10 feet, they begin getting scratched by thorns. If they continue, they take 1 slashing damage per foot climbed. After 20 feet, that increases to 2 slashing damage per foot. The thorns regrow as quickly as they're slashed, burned, or destroyed, and they can't be parted by magic or by abilities. No damage is incurred for moving down the steps.": "从地面到Ziggurat第一层的台阶有50英尺长，上升30英尺。阶梯上布满了树根、藤蔓和爬山虎的纠缠。角色可以爬上前10英尺，比例为0%。10英尺后，他们开始被荆棘刮伤。如果他们继续爬，每爬一英尺就会受到1次砍伤。20英尺后，每英尺增加到2次砍伤。荆棘重新生长的速度与它们被砍、被烧或被破坏的速度一样快，而且它们不能被魔法或能力分开。沿着台阶向下移动不会产生任何伤害。",
	"To ascend the steps, characters must find more of the orange and purple orchids.

However much the characters try to climb and demolish the steps, they never seem to get any worse and the gravel never piles up any deeper.": "从第一层到第二层的台阶有33英尺长，上升20英尺。由于年久失修，石块已经碎裂。那些试图爬上台阶的人发现，在最初的几个台阶之后，石头在他们脚下碎成了砾石，所以他们无法再取得任何进展。无论这些人物如何努力攀登和拆除台阶，它们似乎从未变得更糟，而碎石也从未堆积得更深。",
	"Characters can find parrot feathers in the jungle or lying around on this level after just a few minutes of searching. They need both the feather and the orchid to climb the steps.": "角色在丛林中可以找到鹦鹉的羽毛，或者在这一关的周围，只需搜索几分钟就可以找到。他们需要羽毛和兰花才能爬上台阶。",

	"If the characters haven't yet encountered {@creature Artus Cimber|ToA} and {@creature Dragonbait|ToA}, the duo might be conferring with the {@creature guardian naga} when the party arrives. Saja N'baza knows what happened to the city of Mezro (see \"{@area Mezro|163|x}\") and tells Artus that it won't return as long as {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA} lives. This gives Artus incentive to accompany the party to Omu.": "如果人物还没有遇到{@creature Artus Cimber|ToA}和{@creature Dragonbait|ToA}，当队伍到达时，这两人可能正在与{@creature guardian naga}商议。Saja N'baza知道Mezro城发生了什么（见\"{@area Mezro|163|x}\"），并告诉Artus，只要{@creature Ras Nsi|ToA}活着，它就不会回来。这让阿图斯有动力陪同党派前往奥姆。",
	"After characters leave the shrine, nothing they do brings them back to Saja N'baza's presence. The shrine is a barren chamber every time they reenter. It's dawn of the next day, no matter what time it was when they entered. They can descend the ziggurat with no difficulty, with or without the orchid and feather; the snakes are gone, the steps are solid, and a clear path extends through the plants and thorns. When they reach the ground, characters see blue tulips blooming all around the base of the ziggurat. The tulips are beautiful but nonmagical.": "在人物离开神殿后，他们所做的任何事情都不会让他们回到Saja N'baza的身边。每次他们再次进入神殿时，神殿都是一个荒芜的房间。无论他们进入时是什么时间，都是第二天的黎明。不管有没有兰花和羽毛，他们都能毫无困难地走下金字塔；蛇不见了，台阶很坚固，一条清晰的路穿过植物和荆棘。当他们到达地面时，人物看到蓝色的郁金香在金字塔的底座周围盛开。郁金香很美，但没有魔力。",
	"Port Castigliar (pronounced kah-STEE-lee-ar) is a port in name only.

	"Refuge Bay has a reputation for being a relatively safe place to make landfall. Many explorations of Chult have begun on its white sand beach, which stretches as far as the eye can see around the entire shore of the bay. A Chultan town called Ishau once stood at the head of the bay, but its foundations sank into the sea during the Spellplague. The town's buildings are still largely intact but they now lie more than a mile from dry land, and they're prowled by sharks, plesiosaurs, and sea hags.": "避难湾以其相对安全的登陆地而闻名。许多对楚尔特的探索都是从它的白沙海滩开始的，它围绕着海湾的整个海岸延伸到眼睛所能看到的地方。一座名为Ishau的Chultan镇曾经矗立在海湾的顶端，但它的地基在咒语瘟疫期间沉入大海。该镇的建筑仍然基本完好，但它们现在离旱地有一英里多远，而且有鲨鱼、冥王星和海姬在徘徊。",
	"Steaming-hot water from Lake Luo cools quickly as it tumbles down rapids and low cataracts. This river is recognized by guides and explorers as an important boundary.

	"The Tiryki spills from the back of a mist-shrouded canyon and flows north toward the Bay of Chult, plunging over waterfalls every few miles. This makes it arduous to traverse by canoe upriver—everything must be laboriously portaged around the cataracts—and dangerous to travel downriver, lest a canoe gets caught in the current and swept over a waterfall or smashed in rapids. What's worse, jungle predators and undead prowl both riverbanks. Considering the pterafolk nesting at Firefinger and the grungs living above the gorge, it's easy to see why the Tiryki is considered the most dangerous river in Chult.": "蒂里基河从一个迷雾笼罩的峡谷后面溢出，向北流向楚尔特湾，每隔几英里就会有一个瀑布跌落。这使得乘独木舟逆流而上非常困难--所有东西都必须费力地绕过白内障，而顺流而下则非常危险，以免独木舟被水流卷入瀑布或被激流冲走。更糟糕的是，丛林中的掠食者和亡灵在河岸两边徘徊。考虑到在 \"火指 \"筑巢的翼人和生活在峡谷上方的格罗姆人，不难理解为什么提里基河被认为是楚尔特最危险的河流。",

Such an undertaking would require building a new fort from scratch somewhere on the southwestern coast, and Liara has neither the hands nor the funds for that. She might try to enlist the player characters into making a voyage to scout possible locations for such a fort, if only so she can reassure her impatient superiors in Baldur's Gate that progress is being made.": "这个废弃的沿海村庄既被火山爆发摧毁，又被保存下来。寂静的街道被灰烬掩埋，港口被冷却的熔岩所堵塞。由于Mezro现在基本上被 \"清除 \"了，Beluarian堡的{@creature Liara Portyr|ToA}受到她在Baldur's Gate的赞助人的压力，开始探索和挖掘Shilku，寻找毫无疑问埋藏在那里的宝藏。这样的工作需要在西南海岸的某个地方从头开始建造一个新的堡垒，而利亚拉既没有手也没有资金来做这件事。她可能会努力争取玩家角色进行一次航行，为这样的堡垒探查可能的地点，只要这样她就能向博德之门中不耐烦的上司保证正在取得进展了。",

	"Lava still erupts from the volcano that destroyed Shilku, and it flows like a glowing river down into this bay. The sulfurous water is poisonous, so most of the bay's sea life is dead and the surrounding shore is barren. Safe landing spots can still be found on the beaches along the western shore, but a sailing ship that cruises along the eastern shore near Shilku is likely to lose its sails—and possibly much more—to the red-hot stones that infrequently rain down from the sky or to the burning ash that drifts miles out into the bay before finally extinguishing itself in the stinking, hissing water.": "熔岩仍然从摧毁希尔库的火山中喷发出来，它像一条发光的河流一样流向这个海湾。硫磺水是有毒的，所以海湾的大部分海洋生物都已死亡，周围的海岸也变得荒芜。在西岸的海滩上仍然可以找到安全的登陆点，但是在希尔库附近的东岸巡航的帆船很可能会失去船帆，而且可能会失去更多的船帆--因为烧红的石头不时会从空中落下，或者燃烧的火山灰会漂流到海湾数英里之外，最后在恶臭和嘶嘶的水中自我熄灭。",
	"Cyclopes roam the shore and lair in mountain caves overlooking the bay. These simple creatures aren't inherently hostile, but they are suspicious and wary around newcomers. Any show of malicious intent on the part of strangers is enough to shift the cyclopes from cautious to hostile. They are experts at surviving the dangers of Snapping Turtle Bay, which makes them valuable allies if characters offer them something they want. The cyclopes always need metal tools (shortswords make dandy daggers), and they're delighted by whimsical magical trinkets. For generous inducements, cyclopes could even be hired to serve as bearers, guards, or guides for an expedition headed north into the immense jungle between the Peaks of Flame and the Valley of Dread.": "独眼巨人在岸边游荡，并在俯瞰海湾的山洞里藏身。这些简单的生物本质上并不具有敌意，但它们对新来者充满怀疑和警惕。陌生人的任何恶意表现都足以让独眼巨人从谨慎转变为敌意。他们是在鳄龟湾的危险中生存的专家，这使得他们成为有价值的盟友，如果角色提供他们想要的东西。剑水蚤总是需要金属工具（短剑是一把漂亮的匕首），他们对异想天开的魔法饰品很感兴趣。在慷慨的诱惑下，剑水蚤甚至可以被雇来充当携带者、守卫或向导，带领探险队向北进入火焰之峰和恐惧之谷之间的巨大丛林。",

Firenewt warriors mounted on giant striders (see {@adventure appendix D|ToA|9}) enforce that claim, making the valley very dangerous for interlopers. Tzindelor, the young red dragon inhabiting Wyrmheart Mine, is the only creature whose might and authority the firenewts begrudgingly respect.

	"Inside the mine, the cave opens into an enormous, 250-foot-deep pit. The dwarves left a stout stone column in the middle to support the roof, and they built a wooden walkway to span the pit from south to north.

	"The bottle is stoppered and contains a {@creature dao} named Keshma al-Wazir, who was trapped centuries ago by {@creature Acererak|ToA}. Anyone examining the bottle spots the genie waving from within and hears her muffled voice calling out. Keshma speaks Terran only. At first, she orders the characters to release her. If they refuse, she tries to bargain with them (see \"Roleplaying the Dao\" below). While trapped inside the bottle, Keshma can't attack or cast spells. Once she's released, she can cast the {@spell tongues} spell to better communicate with her liberators.": "瓶子有塞子，里面有一个叫Keshma al-Wazir的{@creature dao}，她在几个世纪前被{@creature Acererak|ToA}困住。任何检查瓶子的人都会发现精灵在里面挥舞，并听到她低沉的声音在呼喊。克什玛只说泰兰德语。起初，她命令那些人物释放她。如果他们拒绝，她会试图与他们讨价还价（见下面的 \"道的角色扮演\"）。当她被困在瓶子里时，克什玛不能攻击或施放法术。一旦她被释放，她可以施展{@spell tongues}法术，以更好地与她的解放者沟通。",

	"At first, Keshma promises the characters riches in exchange for freedom—the sapphires coiled through her braided hair and the platinum armbands (see \"Treasure\" below). Such baubles mean little to the dao in the greater scheme of things, but she feigns anguish in surrendering them. If the characters press for more, Keshma promises to take them anywhere in the multiverse. Finally, she offers to travel with them through the tomb and aid them three times with her spells.": "起初，克什玛承诺用财富来换取自由--盘在她辫子上的蓝宝石和铂金臂章（见下文 \"宝藏\"）。在更大的计划中，这些小玩意对道长来说意义不大，但她假装痛苦地交出了它们。如果人物要求更多，凯什玛承诺会带他们去多元宇宙的任何地方。最后，她提出与他们一起穿越古墓，用她的法术帮助他们三次。",

	"A {@spell detect magic} spell or similar effect reveals an aura of enchantment surrounding the clay urn.

Until the effect ends, the creature also takes 11 ({@dice 2d10}) psychic damage at the end of each of its turns as discordant, percussive music overwhelms its mind. Any creature under the effect of a {@spell mind blank} spell or similar magic doesn't hear this music or suffer the psychic damage. A successful {@spell dispel magic} (DC 18) dismisses the effect on the urn, allowing it to be touched safely.": "一个{@spell detect magic}的法术或类似的效果会在泥瓮周围显示一个魔法的光环。第一个接触骨灰盒或干扰其内容物的生物必须在DC21智慧救赎中成功，否则会受到{@spell Otto's irresistible dance}法术的影响。直到效果结束，该生物在每个回合结束时还会受到11({@dice 2d10})的精神伤害，因为不和谐的打击性音乐压迫着它的思想。任何受到{@spell mind blank}法术或类似魔法影响的生物都不会听到这种音乐或受到精神伤害。成功的{@spell dispel magic}(DC18)可以解除对骨灰盒的影响，让它可以安全地被触摸。",
	"Inside the sarcophagus are a {@item potion of poison} disguised as a {@item potion of supreme healing} and a petrified grung egg that functions as a {@item pearl of power}.

If multiple creatures are in the pit, randomly determine which creature is teleported. Rotating the statue of Torm to the right teleports anything on or above the third plinth into the pit. Even if nothing is there, a popping is heard as air rushes in to fill the empty space. When a statue that has been turned is released, it grinds back to its starting position.": "对基座的任何检查都会发现，每座雕像都设置在一个旋转的、带弹簧的齿轮上。如果阿苏斯的雕像向右旋转，坑里的一个生物就会被传送到第三个基座上，把站在那里的任何其他生物逼到一边。如果坑中有多个生物，则随机决定哪个生物被传送。将托尔姆的雕像向右旋转，会将第三块基座上或上面的任何东西传送到坑里。即使那里什么都没有，也会听到 \"啪 \"的一声，因为空气会冲进坑里来填补空隙。当被转动的雕像被释放时，它就会被磨回它的起始位置。",

A character using thieves' tools can pick the lock with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. However, opening the chest by any means other than the silver key releases a cloud of gas that fills a 15-foot cube centered above the chest (filling the entire pit).

Metal objects sealed in containers are protected.": "箱子和它的铰链是由石头制成的。箱子重达250磅，装有一个银质的锁具。打开锁需要巨魔脖子上挂着的银色钥匙。一个{@spell mage hand}的法术或类似的魔法可以将钥匙从石像的脖子上取下来，而不会引起石像的攻击。使用盗贼工具的角色可以通过成功的DC20灵巧检查来开锁。然而，用银钥匙以外的任何方法打开箱子都会释放出一团气体，填满箱子上方15英尺的立方体（充满整个坑）。这种气体会立即腐蚀并摧毁所有与之接触的非魔法金属，包括盔甲和武器。密封在容器中的金属物体会受到保护。",

	"This cursed human skull plated in gold is the remains of a fool named Yaka—an entertainer who once amused the royal family of Omu. If any character touches it, the skull levitates into the air and begins to follow that character everywhere. The skull never strays more than a few feet away, teleporting back to the character's side if it loses sight of him or her. As it hovers, Yaka's skull supplies a stream of deadpan banter in a mocking, hollow voice. Unless the skull is magically silenced, its inopportune comments cause the character to make all ability checks with disadvantage.": "这个被诅咒的镀金人头骨是一个名叫亚卡的傻瓜的遗体，他是一个曾经逗乐奥姆皇室的艺人。如果任何角色接触到它，头骨就会悬浮在空中，并开始跟随该角色到处跑。骷髅头从未离开过几英尺远，如果失去踪迹就会传送回角色身边。当它在空中盘旋时，亚卡的头骨会以嘲讽、空洞的声音提供一串死板的戏言。除非骷髅头被魔法消音，否则它不合时宜的评论会使角色在进行所有能力检查时处于不利地位。",
	"Roleplay the skull as cruel and cynical, with a dark sense of humor. It knows nothing of the tomb but pretends to know all. {@creature Acererak|ToA} has warded the skull with powerful magic, rendering it impervious to damage and spells.

	"The curse can also be ended by feeding gemstones to the skull, which it craves. The skull chews up and destroys any nonmagical gem fed to it, leaving no trace of the gem behind. Once it destroys 10,000 gp worth of gemstones, the skull teleports back to its pedestal and the curse ends for the affected character.": "诅咒也可以通过给骷髅头喂食宝石来结束，它渴望得到宝石。骷髅头会咀嚼并摧毁任何喂给它的非魔法宝石，不留下任何宝石的痕迹。一旦它摧毁了价值10,000金币的宝石，头骨就会传送回它的基座，受影响的人物的诅咒就会结束。",

Additionally, as long as the chain is intact, damage dealt to either guardian is divided evenly between them. The spiked chain can be attacked separately and has AC 18, a damage threshold of 10, 5 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the chain breaks, both tomb guardians instantly go berserk.": "将守护者捆绑在一起的魔法尖刺链可以防止他们相距超过15英尺。此外，只要链子是完整的，对任何一个守护者造成的伤害都会在他们之间平均分配。带刺的锁链可以被单独攻击，它有18点攻击力，伤害阈值为10，5点命中率，对毒药和精神伤害免疫。如果链子断裂，两个古墓守护者都会立即狂暴起来。",

	"The black drape conceals a magical sphere of iron, 6 feet in diameter and floating 20 feet above the floor.

	"Throwing the black drape over the sphere renders it temporarily inert, with creatures and objects stuck to it falling to the floor. A successful {@spell dispel magic} (DC 16) cast on the sphere dispels the {@spell Nystul's magic aura} spell, permanently deactivates the magnetic field, and causes the sphere to crash to the floor. This sends a web of cracks through the marble, negating the floor's frictionless effect and allowing creatures to move across it normally.

	"The slots in each pedestal are 4 feet above the floor and roughly the size of a standard coin. All humanoids must pay a tithe before leaving this room to avoid provoking the gargoyles' wrath. Specifically, each humanoid must insert a coin of the appropriate type into each pedestal (1 cp in the north pedestal, 1 sp in the east pedestal, 1 gp in the south pedestal, and 1 pp in the west pedestal). A gargoyle will always accept a more precious coin than the one required, so a character inserting a platinum coin into every pedestal could exit the room safely. A gargoyle will also accept a tithe of multiple coins of equal or greater value (10 cp instead of 1 sp in the east pedestal, for example). The pedestals have hollow cavities within them to store the coins (see \"Treasure\" below).": "每个基座上的槽离地面有4英尺高，大约有一个标准硬币大小。所有的人形生物在离开这个房间之前都必须缴纳什一税，以避免激起石像鬼的愤怒。具体来说，每个人形生物都必须将相应类型的硬币放入每个基座（北边的基座为1cp，东边的基座为1sp，南边的基座为1gp，而西边的基座为1pp）。石像鬼总是会接受比所需硬币更珍贵的硬币，所以一个角色在每个基座上都插入一枚白金硬币，就可以安全地离开这个房间。石像鬼也会接受同等或更高价值的多枚硬币的什一税（例如，在东边的基座中是10cp而不是1sp）。基座内有空洞，可以储存硬币（见下文 \"宝藏\"）。",
	"The gargoyles always know when they're being cheated. If any humanoid leaves the room without offering sufficient coin, any cheated gargoyles spring to life and attack the cheapskate. A gargoyle also springs to life and attacks if it or its pedestal is damaged in any way. The metallic tiles atop the pedestals can be pried loose, but they turn to dust if removed from this chamber.": "夜行神龙们总是知道自己被欺骗了。如果任何一个人形生物没有提供足够的硬币就离开房间，任何受骗的石像鬼都会复活并攻击那个吝啬鬼。如果石像鬼或其基座受到任何损害，它也会复活并攻击。基座上的金属瓦片可以被撬开，但如果从这个房间移走，它们就会变成灰尘。",

	"Princess Mwaxanaré can't afford to pay characters what this treasure is worth, and she will despise them for selling it to someone else. Three of Port Nyanzaru's merchant princes express interest in buying the chalice: {@creature Ifan Talro'a|ToA} wants to add it to his private collection of Chultan relics, Kwayothé wants to melt it down, and {@creature Zhanthi|ToA} wants it for sentimental reasons. Denying any one of them would be a grave mistake on the characters' part and might result in them receiving an ominous Ytepka Society token.": "Mwaxanaré公主付不起这个宝物的价值，她会鄙视他们把它卖给别人。尼安扎鲁港的三位商人王子表示有兴趣购买这个圣杯。{@creature Ifan Talro'a|ToA}想把它加入他的苏丹遗物的私人收藏中，Kwayothé想把它融化，{@creature Zhanthi|ToA}出于感情上的考虑想要它。拒绝他们中的任何一个人都是一个严重的错误，可能会导致他们收到一个不祥的Ytepka协会令牌。",

If the characters destroy the Soulmonger and Syndra is still alive, priests quickly restore her to full health, and the characters can collect their promised reward. If Syndra dies but her soul is saved before the atropal devours it, she is raised from the dead within a tenday of the Soulmonger's destruction and honors her agreement with the party. In the event that Syndra dies and her soul is devoured, her body lies in state pending a funeral and proper burial.": "在九神之墓中幸存下来的角色不会知道{@creature Syndra Silvane|ToA}的命运，直到他们回到尼安萨鲁港，使用{@spell scrying}等法术监视她，或者用{@spell sending}法术或类似魔法接触她。如果角色们消灭了灵魂使者，而辛德拉还活着，牧师们会迅速将她恢复到完全健康状态，角色们就可以领取他们承诺的奖励。如果辛德拉死了，但她的灵魂在阿托帕尔吞噬之前得到了救赎，她会在灵魂使者被摧毁后的一个工作日内起死回生，并履行她与队伍的协议。如果辛德拉死了，她的灵魂被吞噬了，她的尸体就会躺在那里，等待葬礼和适当的埋葬。",

	"With or without the ring, {@creature Artus Cimber|ToA} continues to await Mezro's return while searching for the means to reach or summon the displaced city. Nothing matters to him more than reuniting with his wife. Characters interested in helping Artus can use divination spells or downtime to conduct research. They might also consult with the Harpers, who have access to lore that might assist Artus in his quest, but they demand the ring in exchange for their assistance. Forced to choose between the Harpers' assistance and the ring, Artus chooses the latter. Alternatively, a portal to Mezro's demiplane might be hidden somewhere in Chult, creating the seeds of a wonderful new adventure.": "不管有没有戒指，{@creature Artus Cimber|ToA}继续等待Mezro的回归，同时寻找到达或召唤流离失所城市的方法。对他来说，没有什么比与他的妻子团聚更重要的了。对帮助阿图斯感兴趣的角色可以利用占卜法术或停工时间进行研究。他们也可以向哈珀人咨询，哈珀人可以获得可能有助于阿图斯探索的传说，但他们要求用戒指来换取他们的帮助。在哈珀斯的帮助和戒指之间，阿图斯被迫选择了后者。另外，通向Mezro的半位面的入口可能隐藏在Chult的某个地方，为一场精彩的新冒险埋下了种子。",

You can also let the players narrate their way through avoiding easy encounters, or you can increase the difficulty of easy encounters to keep them exciting. One way to make an encounter more challenging is to have it trigger a second random encounter. For example, a fight with goblins might attract a nearby pack of ghouls or dinosaurs.
