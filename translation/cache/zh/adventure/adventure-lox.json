	"This Dungeons & Dragons adventure begins in a world of your choosing, then ventures into Wildspace and the Astral Sea. The characters navigate these environments aboard ships that can traverse vast distances by using a magical form of travel known as spelljamming. Before running this adventure, read the {@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}, which contains information about these settings and how spelljamming works. The adventure assumes the characters have no prior experience with spelljamming—but that is about to change!": "这个《龙与地下城》的冒险从你选择的世界开始，然后冒险进入荒野空间和星海。角色们在这些环境中航行，通过使用一种被称为 \"咒语干扰 \"的神奇旅行方式，可以穿越遥远的距离。在进行这个冒险之前，请阅读{@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}，其中包含了关于这些设置和咒语干扰如何工作的信息。这个冒险假定人物以前没有使用咒语干扰的经验--但这将会改变!",
	"The information in this book is for the DM's eyes only. If you're planning to play the adventure with someone else as your DM, stop reading now.": "本书中的信息仅供DM参考。如果你打算和别人一起玩这个冒险，请停止阅读。",
	"This story revolves around the characters' efforts to save their home world from an attack by an empire of astral elves. The attack is underway when the adventure begins. After taking refuge aboard a spelljamming vessel, the characters head for the stars to discover who is responsible for the attack and how they can save their world.": "这个故事围绕着人物努力拯救他们的家乡，使之免遭星际精灵帝国的攻击。冒险开始时，攻击正在进行中。在一艘法术干扰船上避难后，这些人物前往星空，探寻谁是这次攻击的罪魁祸首，以及他们如何拯救自己的世界。",
	"During the adventure, the characters encounter many space-dwelling creatures, some of which become companions on the party's voyage. The characters also meet Princess Xedalli, an astral elf who is embroiled in a power struggle with her twin brother, Prince Xeleth, over who will rule the empire that currently threatens the characters' world. With or without Xedalli's help, the characters must assemble an unlikely alliance to strike at the heart of the astral elf empire.": "在冒险过程中，角色们遇到了许多空间生物，其中一些成为了他们的同伴。角色们还遇到了Xedalli公主，一个星际精灵，她与她的孪生兄弟Xeleth王子卷入了一场权力斗争，争夺目前威胁到角色们世界的帝国的统治者。不管有没有Xedalli的帮助，这些人物必须组建一个不太可能的联盟，以打击星际精灵帝国的核心。",
	"The characters encounter many grandiose locations as the adventure unfolds, including an asteroid city known as the Rock of Bral and the imperial citadel of the astral elves, which orbits a star called Xaryxis.": "随着冒险的展开，角色们遇到了许多宏伟的地点，包括一个被称为布拉尔之石的小行星城市和星际精灵的帝国城堡，它围绕着一颗名为Xaryxis的恒星运行。",
	"The light of Xaryxis has nourished the Xaryxian Empire for millennia, serving as a wellspring for the magical power that the astral elves of Xaryxispace use to sustain their empire. A thousand years ago, the star's light began to fade, threatening the elves' prosperity, so Emperor Xavan turned the dying star into a parasite that leaches the life from worlds using crystal seeds harvested from the star.": "Xaryxis的光芒滋养了Xaryxian帝国数千年，作为Xaryxispace的星际精灵用来维持其帝国的神奇力量的源泉。一千年前，这颗恒星的光芒开始减弱，威胁到了精灵们的繁荣，所以Xavan皇帝把这颗垂死的恒星变成了一种寄生虫，利用从恒星上收获的水晶种子从世界上吸取生命。",
	"After the elves select a suitable host world, ships known as star moths release hundreds of astral seeds into the planet's atmosphere. The seeds fall from the sky and bury themselves in the ground and the oceans of the world. After the astral seeds take root, they produce enormous crystalline vines. The tendrils of these vines extend deep into the world and draw life energy from it. Once the vines have sapped a world of its energy, a process that can take months, they send out a bright beam of light that travels back to Xaryxis, temporarily replenishing the star's radiance and leaving the host world a barren husk.": "在精灵们选择了一个合适的宿主世界后，被称为星蛾的飞船向该星球的大气层释放了数百颗星体种子。这些种子从天而降，埋在世界的地面和海洋中。在星体种子生根发芽后，它们会产生巨大的结晶藤蔓。这些藤蔓的卷须延伸到世界深处，从世界中汲取生命能量。一旦这些藤蔓耗尽了一个世界的能量，这个过程可能需要几个月，它们就会发出一道明亮的光束，回到Xaryxis，暂时补充恒星的光芒，让宿主的世界变成荒芜的躯壳。",
	"Although Xaryxis shines brilliantly after each replenishment, it isn't long before the light of Xaryxis begins to wane once more, presaging the doom of another world.": "尽管每次补给后Xaryxis都会发出耀眼的光芒，但不久后Xaryxis的光芒就开始再次减弱，预示着另一个世界的末日。",
	"Once astral seeds have taken root on a host world, there is no easy way to stop the transformation—the vines are too thick and too numerous to be uprooted. Destroying the star Xaryxis, which acts as a lodestone for the astral seeds, is the only way to free a world from their grip. If the star goes dark, the crystal vines release their stored energy back into the host world, shrivel, and die.": "一旦星界种子在一个宿主世界上生根发芽，就没有简单的方法来阻止它的转变--藤蔓太粗，数量太多，无法被连根拔起。摧毁作为星界种子宿主的Xaryxis星，是使一个世界摆脱它们控制的唯一方法。如果这颗恒星变黑，水晶藤蔓就会把它们储存的能量释放到宿主世界中，萎缩并死亡。",
	"This adventure has four parts, each divided into three chapters. Each chapter is designed to be run as a single play experience lasting 2 to 3 hours, with the expectation that a group should be able to complete the adventure in twelve sessions of play.": "这个冒险有四个部分，每个部分分为三个章节。每一章都被设计成持续2到3小时的单一游戏体验，期望一个小组能够在12次游戏中完成这个冒险。",
	"Each chapter begins with an overview that gives you a sense of what is ahead for the heroes and recaps what has happened so far. There's no telling how a session will unfold, since the players have some control over the plot, but the text tries to give you enough information to run the various creatures and encounters. If the characters do something unexpected, improvise as best you can while gently steering them toward their main goal. Each chapter ends with a cliffhanger to set the stage for the next session, assuming things go as planned.": "每一章的开头都有一个概述，让你了解英雄们的未来，并回顾到目前为止所发生的事情。由于玩家对剧情有一定的控制权，所以不知道会话将如何展开，但文本试图给你足够的信息来运行各种生物和遭遇。如果角色们做了一些出乎意料的事情，你要尽可能地即兴发挥，同时温和地引导他们走向主要目标。每一章的结尾都有一个悬念，为下一节课做好铺垫，前提是事情按计划进行。",
	"The four parts of the adventure are as follows:": "冒险的四个部分如下。",
	"{@adventure Part 1: Seeds of Destruction|LoX|1} chronicles the devastation wrought by the astral seeds on the characters' home world and the party's escape into Wildspace. After fleeing to the Rock of Bral, the characters seek out Commodore Krux, a giff, hoping he can help them thwart the Xaryxian Empire's machinations and save the characters' world in the process.": "{@adventure Part 1: Seeds of Destruction|LoX|1}记录了星界种子对人物的家乡世界造成的破坏，以及当事人逃往荒野空间的过程。在逃到布拉尔岩石后，人物找到了吉夫准将克鲁克斯，希望他能帮助他们挫败夏里安帝国的阴谋并在此过程中拯救人物的世界。",
	"{@adventure Part 2: Terrors of the Void|LoX|2} deals with the characters' journey to the edge of their Wildspace system, where they encounter Princess Xedalli and learn the enormity of the task that lies before them. The characters head for Doomspace, where Krux plans to join a coalition of those that oppose the Xaryxian Empire.": "{@adventure Part 2: Terrors of the Void|LoX|2}讲述了角色们前往威尔兹空间系统边缘的旅程，在那里他们遇到了Xedalli公主，并了解到摆在他们面前的任务的艰巨性。角色们前往末日空间，在那里，克鲁克斯计划加入一个反对夏里安帝国的联盟。",
	"{@adventure Part 3: Chaos in Doomspace|LoX|3} begins with the party's arrival in Doomspace, where the coalition they had intended to join turns out to be a bunch of quarreling factions. They must find a way to unite the factions before attacking the Xaryxian Empire.": "{@adventure Part 3: Chaos in Doomspace|LoX|3}开始时，党员们来到了厄运空间，他们原本打算加入的联盟变成了一群争吵不休的派别。他们必须在进攻Xaryxian帝国之前找到一种方法来团结各派别。",
	"{@adventure Part 4: Saviors of the Multiverse|LoX|4} describes Xaryxispace and the characters' climactic encounter with Prince Xeleth and the armada under his command. Finally, the characters arrive at the imperial citadel, where they discover the true cost of saving their world and must decide the fate of Xaryxis and the Xaryxian Empire before making the long voyage home.": "{@adventure Part 4: Saviors of the Multiverse|LoX|4}描述了Xaryxispace以及人物与Xeleth王子和他指挥的舰队的高潮遭遇。最后，人物到达了帝国城堡，在那里他们发现了拯救世界的真正代价，必须在长途跋涉回家之前决定Xaryxis和Xaryxian帝国的命运。",
	"Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.": "出现在这样的方框中的文字是为了让玩家在他们的角色第一次到达某个地点或在某个特定情况下大声朗读或转述，如文中所述。",
	"Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, while magic items are described in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, unless the adventure's text directs you to the {@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}.": "冒险中提到的法术和装备在{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中描述，而魔法物品在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中描述，除非冒险中的文字指示你去{@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}。",
	"The {@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG} describes the many types of {@book spelljamming vessels|AAG|2|Spelljammer Vessels} mentioned in the adventure and includes deck plans for each one. At your discretion, you can provide the players with a copy of the deck plans for whatever ship they're sailing aboard and allow them to manage the ship's activity during encounters, freeing you to concentrate on running the nonplayer characters and their ships.": "{@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}描述了冒险中提到的多种类型的{@book spelljamming vessels|AAG|2|Spelljammer Vessels}，包括每一种类型的甲板计划。根据你的判断，你可以为玩家提供一份他们所乘坐的任何船只的甲板计划，并允许他们在遭遇战中管理船只的活动，从而使你能够专注于管理非玩家角色和他们的船只。",
	"{@i Light of Xaryxis} is inspired by the 1980 film {@i Flash Gordon} and serialized Flash Gordon comic strips from the 1930s. The adventure's heroes, like Flash Gordon himself, must defeat otherworldly foes to save their home planet. Campy supporting characters, implausible situations, and over-the-top dialogue help push the story toward its inevitable conclusion. Absurd plot twists undercut the sense of urgency, keeping the heroes on their toes as they stumble from one cliffhanger to the next.": "{@i Light of Xaryxis}的灵感来自1980年的电影{@i Flash Gordon}和20世纪30年代的连载Flash Gordon漫画。冒险的英雄们，就像闪电侠戈登本人一样，必须打败其他世界的敌人来拯救他们的地球家园。蹩脚的配角、难以置信的情况和夸张的对话有助于将故事推向其不可避免的结论。荒谬的情节转折削弱了紧迫感，使英雄们在从一个悬念到另一个悬念的过程中保持警惕。",
	"Here are some things you can do to make {@i Light of Xaryxis} feel like the pulpy sci-fi tales that inspired it:": "这里有一些你可以做的事情，使{@i Light of Xaryxis}感觉像激发它的纸浆科幻故事。",
	"Any nonplayer character who isn't fighting the heroes should naturally defer to the heroes, giving players the sense that their characters matter (no matter how puny and insignificant they might seem to their enemies).": "任何不与英雄作战的非玩家角色都应该自然地服从于英雄，让玩家感觉到他们的角色很重要（无论他们在敌人看来是多么微不足道）。",
	"End each session with a cliffhanger. The adventure already has one at the end of each chapter, but you can create your own cliffhanger by ending a session with an unexpected threat, twist, or revelation.": "用一个悬念来结束每个环节。冒险故事在每一章的结尾都有一个悬念，但是你可以用一个意想不到的威胁、转折或启示来结束会议，创造你自己的悬念。",
	"When you're ready to begin a new chapter, read or paraphrase the recap that appears at the start of the chapter, embellishing it with pertinent events or memorable quotes from earlier game sessions.": "当你准备开始新的一章时，阅读或转述出现在这一章开头的回顾，用相关的事件或早期游戏环节中令人难忘的引言来润色它。",
	"The adventure assumes that the characters start at 5th level. If your players have characters of lower level, they will need to go on some other adventures first to gain enough experience to advance to 5th level. Both the Dungeons & Dragons {@i Starter Set} and the Dungeons & Dragons {@i Essentials Kit} contain adventures that will take characters from 1st level to 5th level. Alternatively, you can simply ask your players to create new 5th-level characters, as described in the next section.": "这个冒险假设角色从5级开始。如果你的玩家的角色等级较低，他们需要先去参加一些其他的冒险，以获得足够的经验来提升到5级。龙与地下城》{@i Starter Set}和《龙与地下城》{@i Essentials Kit}都包含了可以让角色从1级升到5级的冒险。另外，你也可以简单地要求你的玩家创建新的5级角色，如下一节所述。",
	"If, during the adventure, a player wants to create a new character (perhaps because their previous one died or left the party), that player can roll up a new character of the same level as the rest of the adventuring party, choosing from the options available. If the party is in Wildspace or the Astral Sea, you can assume that all the character options from the {@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG} are available.": "如果在冒险过程中，有玩家想要创建一个新的角色（也许是因为他们之前的角色死了或者离开了队伍），该玩家可以卷起一个与冒险队伍其他成员相同等级的新角色，从现有的选项中选择。如果队伍是在荒野空间或星海，你可以假设{@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}中所有的角色选项都是可用的。",
	"To create 5th-level characters for this adventure, players can use the {@book character creation steps|PHB|0} outlined in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}. In addition to more hit points, class features, and spells, each character has normal starting equipment plus 625 gp to spend on additional nonmagical gear. If you're running a high magic campaign, each character also gains one uncommon magic item of the player's choice, subject to your approval.": "要为这次冒险创建5级人物，玩家可以使用{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中概述的{@book character creation steps|PHB|0}。除了更多的命中率、阶级特征和法术外，每个角色都有正常的起始装备，外加625金币用于购买额外的非魔力装备。如果你进行的是高魔法活动，每个角色还可以获得一个由玩家选择的不常见的魔法物品，但要经过你的批准。",
	"At the end of each of the adventure's parts, everyone in the party receives enough experience points to advance 1 level so that they are at the level they should be for the next chapter, as shown in the Character Levels table. Characters who finish the adventure advance to 9th level.": "在冒险的每个部分结束时，聚会中的每个人都会得到足够的经验值来提升1级，这样他们就会达到下一章应该达到的等级，如角色等级表所示。完成冒险的角色会提升到9级。",
	"The adventure begins in a coastal city or port town on a world where the characters are either seeking their fortunes or resting between adventures. Since most of this adventure takes place in Wildspace and the Astral Sea, the initial setting doesn't have much effect on how the adventure will play out. The characters' home world serves mainly to set the stakes for the story—it's in danger of being destroyed!—so using a world your players are familiar with works best, whether that is a published campaign setting or a world of your own creation.": "冒险开始于一个沿海城市或港口城市，在这个世界上，人物要么在寻找他们的财富，要么在冒险之间休息。由于这次冒险的大部分内容都发生在荒野空间和星海，所以最初的设定对冒险的发展并没有什么影响。角色们的家乡主要是为故事设定赌注--它有被摧毁的危险！--所以使用玩家们熟悉的世界是最好的，无论那是已出版的战役设定还是你自己创造的世界。",
	"If you used {@adventure Lost Mine of Phandelver|LMoP} (the adventure in the Dungeons & Dragons {@i Starter Set}) or {@adventure Dragon of Icespire Peak|DIP} (the adventure in the Dungeons & Dragons {@i Essentials Kit}) to get the characters to 5th level, then {@i Light of Xaryxis} begins in the same region featured in those introductory adventures: the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms setting, on the world of Toril. The city of Neverwinter, one of several major ports along the Sword Coast, could easily be where the characters find themselves at the beginning of this adventure.": "如果你用{@adventure Lost Mine of Phandelver|LMoP}（《龙与地下城》{@i Starter Set}中的冒险）或{@adventure Dragon of Icespire Peak|DIP}（《龙与地下城》{@i Essentials Kit}中的冒险）使角色达到5级，那么{@i Light of Xaryxis}就是从这些介绍性冒险中的同一个地区开始的：被遗忘的领域设定中的剑海岸，在托里尔世界。梦幻之城是剑海岸的几个主要港口之一，可以很容易地让人物在这次冒险的开始就找到自己。",
	"All the locations the characters visit in this adventure are described in this book, and further details about the {@book Rock of Bral|AAG|3} are provided in the {@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}.": "本冒险中人物所到的所有地点在本书中都有描述，而关于{@book Rock of Bral|AAG|3}的进一步细节在{@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}中提供。",
	"In addition to being a fascinating encounter in its own right, the {@creature starlight apparition|BAM} (see {@book Boo's Astral Menagerie|BAM}) can be a useful device for you if a key nonplayer character meets an unfortunate and unexpected end. If, later in the adventure, the characters need a piece of information only that nonplayer character would know, you can have the nonplayer character appear in the form of a starlight apparition to guide the characters.": "除了本身是一个迷人的遭遇之外，如果一个关键的非玩家角色遇到了不幸和意外的结局，{@creature starlight apparition|BAM}（见{@book Boo's Astral Menagerie|BAM}）可以成为你有用的装置。如果在冒险的后期，角色们需要一个只有那个非玩家角色才知道的信息，你可以让那个非玩家角色以星光幻影的形式出现，引导角色。",
	"As the adventure opens, the characters are going about their daily business in a bustling coastal settlement, where everyone is talking about the spectacular meteor showers that have blazed through the sky the past several nights. In fact, what folks have witnessed are showers of astral seeds falling from space and plunging deep into the ground and water in and around the settlement. Some of these seeds have now germinated. The adventure begins when enormous crystalline vines erupt from beneath the streets, throwing the community into chaos.": "当冒险开始时，角色们正在一个繁华的沿海定居点做他们的日常工作，每个人都在谈论过去几个晚上在天空中闪耀的壮观的流星雨。事实上，人们所看到的是星际种子雨，它们从太空中坠落，深深地扎入定居点及其周围的地面和水中。其中一些种子现在已经发芽了。当巨大的结晶藤蔓从街道下面喷发出来，使社区陷入混乱时，冒险开始了。",
	"When you are ready to begin play, read:": "当你准备开始游戏时，请阅读。",
	"Your adventures have taken you to a coastal community, where local fishing boats share the harbor with trade vessels from far and wide. Lately everyone has been discussing the deluge of falling stars that has lit up the evening sky for the past several nights. Some say these celestial events are omens of impending disaster. Others believe they are a precursor to the gods descending from the heavens to walk the land. No one knows for sure.": "你的冒险已经把你带到了一个沿海社区，当地的渔船与来自远方的贸易船只共享港口。最近，每个人都在讨论在过去的几个晚上照亮夜空的大量坠落的星星。有些人说这些天体事件是即将发生的灾难的预兆。其他人则认为它们是众神从天而降，行走于大地的前兆。没有人知道是怎么回事。",
	"You are just finishing your midday meal while listening to a blacksmith tell about being awakened last night by a loud crash. According to the smith, a crystalline vine burst out of the ground and punched a hole through the roof of his neighbor's bakery. \"Must be divine punishment for the bad pies and steep prices,\" says the blacksmith with a nervous chuckle. Suddenly, the earth shakes violently beneath your feet. You hear the dull roar of a distant eruption. The smith and several others hurry outside. Joining them, you see a sinuous, crystalline vine erupting from the ground a few blocks away—tall enough to be seen above the rooftops. Screams of panic rise from the same direction.": "你刚吃完中午的饭，就听一个铁匠说起昨晚被一声巨响惊醒的事。据铁匠说，一根晶莹的藤蔓冲出地面，在他邻居的面包店屋顶上打了一个洞。\"这一定是对糟糕的馅饼和昂贵的价格的神圣惩罚，\"铁匠紧张地笑着说。突然，大地在你的脚下剧烈摇晃。你听到了远处火山爆发的沉闷轰鸣声。铁匠和其他几个人急忙跑到外面。和他们一起，你看到一条蜿蜒的结晶藤蔓从几个街区外的地面上喷发出来--高得可以在屋顶上看到。惊恐的尖叫声从同一方向传来。",
	"A sailor standing in your midst says, \"I think it's time I returned to my ship. You're welcome to join me. You would be wise to flee as well.\" With that, she makes her way toward the docks.": "一个站在你中间的水手说：\"我想我是时候回到我的船上了。欢迎你加入我。你也会明智地逃走的。\" 就这样，她向码头走去。",
	"The ground churns again, and more eruptions burst through the streets all around you. From these sites sprout smaller crystalline vines that uproot themselves and begin lurching through the streets, driving panicked citizens before them, while the enormous vine in the distance stretches ever taller.": "地面再次搅动，更多的喷发在你周围的街道上迸发出来。从这些地方萌发出更小的结晶藤蔓，它们连根拔起，开始在街道上蹒跚而行，把惊慌失措的市民赶到它们面前，而远处的巨大藤蔓则越伸越高。",
	"The friendly sailor, Elaina Sartell, is described later in the chapter. She flees at once, leaving the characters to decide their own course of action.": "本章后面将描述这位友好的水手，埃莱娜-萨特尔，。她马上逃走了，让人物决定他们自己的行动方向。",
	"The characters have several choices for how to proceed:": "角色们对如何进行有几种选择。",
	"If the characters try to barricade themselves in a building or find somewhere else in the settlement to hide, the increasingly violent earth tremors cause their shelter to partially collapse, making it apparent that there's no safe refuge in the settlement. The characters will need to choose another option.": "如果人物试图把自己堵在建筑物里，或者在定居点里找其他地方躲起来，越来越剧烈的地动会导致他们的庇护所部分坍塌，使得定居点里显然没有安全庇护所。人物将需要选择另一种方案。",
	"The following events occur as the characters move through streets and alleys toward the outskirts of the settlement, but not if they head straight to the docks:": "当人物穿过街道和小巷走向定居点的郊区时，以下事件就会发生，但如果他们直接前往码头就不会发生。",
	"Tremors cause buildings close to the characters to collapse, catching them in an avalanche of debris. Each character must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 ({@dice 4d10}) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "震颤导致靠近人物的建筑物倒塌，使他们陷入雪崩般的碎片中。每个角色必须做一个DC12的灵巧救赎，救赎失败会受到22({@dice 4d10})的重击伤害，救赎成功则受到一半的伤害。",
	"A crowd of thirty commoners rushes past the characters, led by a scrappy youngster who shouts, \"To the docks! We'll take one of the ships! It's our only hope!\" An old woman grabs the arm of a character and moans, \"Those vines are everywhere! There's nowhere safe! We're all doomed!\" Suddenly, a tremor causes a building to collapse, burying half of the crowd and scattering what's left of it.": "一群三十多岁的平民从人物身边冲过，领头的是一个潦倒的年轻人，他喊道：\"去码头！去码头！\"。我们要拿下其中一艘船! 这是我们唯一的希望！\" 一个老妇人抓住一个角色的胳膊，呻吟道：\"那些藤蔓到处都是！没有地方是安全的！\"。没有任何地方是安全的! 我们都要完蛋了！\" 突然，一场震荡导致一栋大楼倒塌，埋葬了一半的人群，剩下的也都散了。",

If the adventure began on Toril, the Rock of Bral is one of several asteroids orbiting the planet, and getting there takes only a few hours. Otherwise, assume the Rock orbits another world or is situated in a nearby asteroid belt and requires several days to reach.": "当{@i Moondancer}号离开星球的大气层，进入荒野空间时，萨特尔船长设定了一条前往布拉尔岩石的路线。现在是时候让你确定布拉尔之石相对于人物母体世界的位置了。一旦你确定了布拉尔之石在威尔兹空间的位置，估计一下{@i Moondancer}的人需要多少天才能到达那里。如果冒险是在托里尔开始的，那么布拉尔之石就是围绕这个星球运行的几个小行星之一，到达那里只需要几个小时。否则，假设岩石围绕另一个世界运行，或者位于附近的小行星带中，需要几天时间才能到达。",
	"In this chapter, the {@i Moondancer} is intercepted by an astral elf vessel shortly after leaving the characters' world, but the characters have time to finish a short rest before the enemy ship arrives.": "在这一章中，{@i Moondancer}号在离开人物的世界后不久就被一艘星际精灵船拦截，但人物有时间在敌船到来之前完成短暂的休息。",
	"Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with {@book chapter 2|AAG|2} of the {@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}. Keep the deck plans for the {@vehicle space galleon|AAG} and the {@vehicle star moth|AAG} handy, because they will come into play.": "在运行本章之前，先熟悉一下{@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}的{@book chapter 2|AAG|2}。把{@vehicle space galleon|AAG}和{@vehicle star moth|AAG}的甲板计划放在手边，因为它们会发挥作用。",
	"Standing on the deck of the {@i Moondancer}, you see scores of crystalline vines erupting from the surface of your world, some of the vines reaching high enough to break through the clouds. You find yourself sailing through a void filled with colorful gases and blinking stars. A school of space-dwelling fish swims past the ship on the starboard side.": "站在{@i Moondancer}号的甲板上，你看到几十条晶莹的藤蔓从你的世界表面喷发出来，有些藤蔓高到足以冲破云层。你发现自己正航行在一个充满五颜六色的气体和闪烁的星星的虚空中。一群居住在空间的鱼从船的右舷游过。",

	"The {@i Moondancer} is armed with two ballistae but has no crew to operate them. Its mangonel was destroyed in a recent engagement, and Captain Sartell hasn't replaced it yet. Getting a new mangonel was the main reason Sartell was on the party's home world, since wood is much easier to find there than at her usual port of call, the Rock of Bral.": "{@i Moondancer}号装备有两台弹弓，但没有船员来操作它们。它的芒格在最近的一次交战中被毁，而萨特尔船长还没有更换它。获得一个新的芒格是萨特尔来到党的家乡的主要原因，因为那里的木材比她通常的停靠港--布拉尔岩石更容易找到。",
	"Captain Sartell operates out of the Rock of Bral as a privateer under the commission of the city's ruler, Prince Andru. She assures the characters that they'll be safe there.": "萨特尔船长在城市统治者安德鲁王子的委托下，以私掠者的身份在布拉尔岩开展活动。她向这些人物保证，他们在那里会很安全。",

	"Captain Sartell grimly informs the characters that the {@vehicle star moth|AAG} is the faster ship and that the {@i Moondancer} has no hope of outrunning it. She estimates the characters have about a minute to prepare before the star moth gets close enough to use its mangonel (at long range). Once that happens, Sartell orders her ship to turn about and close with the astral elves as quickly as possible to minimize the {@i Dark Star}'s opportunity to fire on the {@i Moondancer}. It then takes another minute for the two ships to come within boarding distance.": "萨特尔船长冷酷地告诉角色们，{@vehicle star moth|AAG}是更快的船，{@i Moondancer}没有希望跑过它。她估计，在星蛾接近到足以使用它的芒果（远距离）之前，人物有大约一分钟的准备时间。一旦发生这种情况，萨特尔命令她的船转过来，尽快与星际精灵接近，以尽量减少{@i Dark Star}向{@i Moondancer}开火的机会。然后又花了一分钟，两艘船才进入了登船距离。",
	"Once the ships are close enough, the three {@creature Astral Elf Warrior|BAM|astral elf warriors} board the {@i Moondancer}, their faces hidden behind visors, and haughtily demand Captain Sartell's surrender. She politely declines, prompting the astral elves to attack while the hadozees use the {@i Dark Star}'s ballistae to fire on characters they can see. Captain Sartell fights alongside the characters, but Traevus and his thugs, if they are aboard, come to the {@i Moondancer}'s defense only if it looks like the characters are about to lose.": "一旦船只足够接近，三个{@creature Astral Elf Warrior|BAM|astral elf warriors}登上{@i Moondancer}号，他们的脸藏在面罩后面，傲慢地要求萨特尔船长投降。她礼貌地拒绝了，促使星际精灵们发动攻击，而哈多兹人则用{@i Dark Star}的弹炮向他们能看到的人物开火。萨特尔船长与角色们并肩作战，但特拉维斯和他的打手们，如果他们在船上的话，只有在角色们看起来要输的情况下才会来为{@i Moondancer}辩护。",
	"The astral elves are confident they can conquer the {@i Moondancer}, but if two of the warriors fall, the third tries to retreat to the {@i Dark Star}. After that attempt succeeds or fails, the star moth beats a hasty retreat. The star priest, Altura, remains aboard the {@i Dark Star} and uses a {@spell sending} spell to relay what has happened to Helix, an astral elf on the Rock of Bral (see {@area chapter 4|05a|x}). The hadozees, meanwhile, are not great fighters and either flee or surrender if the characters engage them in melee.": "星际精灵有信心征服{@i Moondancer}，但如果有两个战士倒下了，第三个战士就会试图撤退到{@i Dark Star}。在这一尝试成功或失败后，星际飞蛾就会匆忙撤退。星辰祭司Altura留在{@i Dark Star}号上，用一个{@spell sending}的咒语向布拉尔岩石上的星际精灵Helix转达所发生的事情（见{@area chapter 4|05a|x}）。同时，哈多兹人并不是很好的战士，如果角色与他们近战，他们要么逃跑要么投降。",

The {@i Dark Star} was left behind to monitor the astral seeds' progress.": "在这个威尔兹空间系统中，星际精灵部队的领导人是指挥官Vael。Vael指挥官的大部分舰队已经开始驶回Xaryxispace。{@i Dark Star}被留下来监视星界种子的进展。",
	"The vines and astral blights will feed on the planet's energy and that of its flora and fauna until the party's home world is a dead husk, a process that takes several months. The energy then will be transmitted in a single, enormous burst of light back to the astral elves' home system to be absorbed by their star, Xaryxis.": "这些藤蔓和星际病菌将以这个星球的能量和它的动植物的能量为食，直到党的母体世界成为一个死壳，这个过程需要几个月。然后能量将以一个单一的、巨大的光阵传送回星界精灵的母星系统，被他们的恒星Xaryxis吸收。",
	"Once the astral seeds have begun their work, there is no way to stop the process. (This isn't true, but the crew of the {@i Dark Star} believes it is. The characters won't discover the truth of this matter until later in the adventure.)": "一旦星界种子开始工作，就没有办法停止这个过程。(这不是真的，但{@i Dark Star}号的船员认为这是真的。角色们在冒险的后期才会发现这件事的真相）。",
	"The hadozees are mercenaries and have no insight into the astral elves' motives or plans. Even so, they can provide the characters with the following pieces of information:": "哈多兹人是雇佣兵，对星际精灵的动机和计划没有洞察力。即便如此，他们也能为人物提供以下信息。",
	"The {@i Dark Star}'s cargo hold was packed with at least a hundred astral seeds, which were jettisoned one by one into the atmosphere of the party's home world. (The hadozees don't know what the astral seeds do, but they know that each one resembles a crystal pod roughly the size and shape of a coffin.)": "{@i Dark Star}的货舱里装着至少一百颗星体种子，它们被逐一抛入党的家乡的大气中。(哈多兹人不知道星体种子的作用，但他们知道每个星体种子都像一个水晶豆荚，大小和形状都与棺材差不多)。",
	"The {@i Dark Star} was one of several astral elf ships that traveled to the party's home world. The rest of the fleet has already departed.": "{@i Dark Star}是前往党的家乡世界的几艘星际精灵船之一。舰队的其余部分已经出发了。",
	"The hadozees are willing to serve aboard the {@i Moondancer} if they are treated fairly. If she survives the battle, Captain Sartell puts the hadozees to work, though she keeps them under close supervision.": "如果得到公平对待，哈多兹人愿意在{@i Moondancer}号上服务。如果她在战斗中幸存下来，萨特尔船长让哈多兹人工作，尽管她对他们进行了严格的监督。",
	"If the characters are defeated, the astral elves allow dying characters to be stabilized. The astral elves assume control of the {@i Moondancer} while keeping Captain Sartell hostage aboard the {@i Dark Star} to ensure Flapjack's compliance. The astral elf and hadozee crew members are split between the two ships. The astral elves then start heading for the edge of the Wildspace system to rendezvous with the rest of Vael's fleet. En route, the two ships might encounter the derelict nautiloid, neogi raiders, or the Rock of Bral navy (all described in {@area chapters 3|032|x} and {@area 4|053|x}), providing the characters with opportunities to escape.": "如果角色被打败，星际精灵允许垂死的角色被稳定下来。星际精灵控制了{@i Moondancer}号，同时将萨特尔船长作为人质留在{@i Dark Star}号上，以确保弗拉普杰克的服从。星际精灵和哈多兹的船员被分在两艘船上。然后，星际精灵们开始前往威尔兹空间系统的边缘，与瓦伊尔的其他舰队会合。在途中，两艘船可能会遇到废弃的鹦鹉螺、neogi突袭者或布拉尔海军的岩石（都在{@area chapters 3|032|x}和{@area 4|053|x}中描述），为人物提供了逃跑的机会。",
	"The {@i Dark Star}'s cargo hold contains enough food and water to sustain the ship's crew for twenty days.": "{@i Dark Star}号的货舱里有足够的食物和水，可以让船上的人维持20天。",
	"Assuming the characters repel the astral elves, the {@i Moondancer} resumes its journey to the Rock of Bral. Even if the characters didn't interrogate the astral elves, Captain Sartell has a hunch that the astral elves have something to do with the calamity befalling the party's home planet and says as much. She also mentions knowing someone on the Rock of Bral who might be willing to help the party. If the characters inquire further, Sartell informs them the contact is a giff named Commodore Krux, but she can't tell them more than that since she knows Krux only by reputation.": "假设角色们击退了星际精灵，{@i Moondancer}号重新开始了前往布拉尔岩石的旅程。即使角色们没有审问星界精灵，萨特尔船长也有一种直觉，认为星界精灵与党的母星所遭受的灾难有关，并如是说。她还提到在布拉尔岩石上认识一个可能愿意帮助他们的人。如果人物进一步询问，萨特尔会告诉他们这个联系人是一个叫克鲁克斯准将的吉夫，但她不能告诉他们更多，因为她只是通过声誉认识克鲁克斯。",

	"The ship slows unexpectedly. Around you, on all sides, colossal chunks of rock float in the void. Some of them are overgrown with vegetation, while others are bare stone. Creatures resembling jellyfish and rays glide through the spaces between them.": "船只意外地放慢了速度。在你周围，四面八方，巨大的岩石块漂浮在虚空中。有些岩石上长满了植物，有些则是光秃秃的石头。类似于水母和鳐鱼的生物在它们之间的空间滑行。",
	"Captain Sartell looks about uneasily. \"Hmm. Plenty of places for pirates to hide.\"": "萨特尔船长不安地四处张望。\"嗯，有很多地方可供海盗藏身。\"",
	"As if on cue, a vessel lurking behind a nearby asteroid comes into view. Its enormous spiral shell merges with an open bow, beneath which long tentacles wave as if caught in an invisible current.": "仿佛是在提示我们，一艘潜伏在附近小行星后面的船只进入了我们的视野。它巨大的螺旋形外壳与敞开的船头融合在一起，船头下长长的触角挥舞着，仿佛被一股无形的水流卷入。",
	"Sartell sucks her breath in through her teeth and whispers her next words: \"Mind flayers.\"": "萨特尔从牙缝里吸了口气，低声说着她的下一句话。\"心智飞扬者\"。",

	"As the nautilus-shaped vessel drifts closer, Captain Sartell lets out a sigh of relief. \"It's a derelict,\" she says, pointing out its stripped weaponry and broken hull. \"If there were mind flayers aboard, they would've attacked us by now.

Still, there might be something left worth salvaging.\"": "随着鹦鹉螺形状的船只渐渐靠近，萨特尔船长松了一口气。\"这是一艘废弃的船，\"她说，指着它被剥夺的武器装备和破碎的船体。\"如果船上有心灵传播者，他们现在应该已经攻击我们了。看上去有人已经把它捡起来了。不过，可能还有值得打捞的东西。\"",
	"The sensory input provided by the {@i Moondancer}'s {@item spelljamming helm|AAG} interfaces in a special way with Flapjack's Advanced Telepathy, enabling the flumph to sense the presence of telepathic activity on nearby vessels and making the flumph a sort of early warning system in advance of encounters with mind flayers and their ilk. The nautiloid makes Flapjack uneasy, a feeling that stems from the presence of psurlons on board it. At the same time, the {@creature Psurlon Ringer|BAM|psurlons'} Alien Mind trait confounds the {@creature Flapjack|LoX|flumph's} Advanced Telepathy. Flapjack has the vague sense that something is aboard the derelict vessel but can't say what. He shares this information with Sartell and any characters with whom he has forged a close bond.": "由{@i Moondancer}的{@item spelljamming helm|AAG}提供的感官输入以一种特殊的方式与Flapjack的高级心灵感应对接，使flumph能够感知附近船只上存在的心灵感应活动，并使flumph成为一种早期预警系统，以提前遇到心魔和他们的同类。鹦鹉螺让弗拉普杰克感到不安，这种感觉来自于它身上存在的鹦鹉螺。同时，{@creature Psurlon Ringer|BAM|psurlons'}异形思维的特性使{@creature Flapjack|LoX|flumph's}高级心灵感应受到干扰。弗拉普杰克隐约感觉到在这艘废弃的船上有什么东西，但却说不出是什么。他与萨特尔和任何与他建立了密切联系的人物分享这一信息。",
	"Captain Sartell orders Flapjack to bring her ship alongside the vessel while she designates the characters as a boarding party, instructing them to kill any hostile creatures they encounter.": "萨特尔船长命令弗拉普杰克把她的船开到船边，同时她指定这些人物为登船队，指示他们杀死遇到的任何敌对生物。",
	"If the characters balk at exploring the nautiloid, Captain Sartell sarcastically apologizes for interrupting their \"pleasure cruise\" and wonders aloud whether they'd rather stay back and swab the decks while she does all the hard work. If the characters still refuse, Captain Sartell makes good on her threat and boards the vessel herself in search of salvage. When she doesn't return, Flapjack urges the party to go and find her, refusing to leave the nautiloid behind until they do so.": "如果角色们对探索鹦鹉螺表示拒绝，萨特尔船长会讽刺地对打断他们的 \"快乐巡航 \"表示歉意，并大声地问他们是否愿意呆在后面，在她做所有艰苦工作的时候擦拭甲板。如果他们仍然拒绝，萨特尔船长就会兑现她的威胁，亲自登船去寻找救援物资。当她没有回来时，Flapjack敦促大家去找她，并拒绝在他们这样做之前留下鹦鹉螺。",
	"Whether or not the characters consent to Captain Sartell's plan, they soon see a young human in ragged, bloodstained clothes step out onto the nautiloid's battle prow. He waves his arms to get their attention and seems to be in distress. If one or more characters enter the nautiloid's air envelope, he introduces himself as Benoto Kralazar and explains that his ship (the nautiloid) was attacked by neogi. He informs the characters that most of his crew are dead, but there are still a few survivors aboard in need of healing, and he begs the party's help.": "无论角色们是否同意萨特尔船长的计划，他们很快就看到一个穿着破烂不堪、血迹斑斑的衣服的年轻人类走到了鹦鹉螺号的战舰上。他挥舞着手臂吸引他们的注意，似乎是在受苦。如果一个或多个角色进入鹦鹉螺号的气囊，他就会自我介绍说他是贝诺托-克拉拉扎尔，并解释说他的船（鹦鹉螺号）受到了neogi的攻击。他告诉这些人物，他的大部分船员都死了，但船上还有一些需要治疗的幸存者，他恳求党的帮助。",
	"If the characters board the {@i Lucent Edict}, Benoto shows them around the ship while he spins a tale about his crew's harrowing encounter with a group of neogi. The tale is not entirely fanciful—a band of neogi did recently board the {@i Lucent Edict} in search of salvage, but they retreated once they realized the nautiloid was home to a bunch of psurlons.": "如果人物登上{@i Lucent Edict}号，Benoto就会带他们参观这艘船，同时他还会讲述他的船员与一群neogi的悲惨遭遇的故事。这个故事并不完全是虚构的--最近确实有一队neogi登上了{@i Lucent Edict}号，寻找救援物资，但是当他们发现这个鹦鹉螺号是一群鹦鹉螺的家时，他们就撤退了。",

Krux says he is prepared to pay her back. Fel, however, can sense the giff's desperation, so she insists on also being compensated for the lost revenue of her next venture, which she figures to be 3,000 gp. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check realizes Fel is bluffing—the tiefling secretly reckons she would be lucky to clear 1,000 gp—but she has always suspected Krux of having deep pockets and has no qualms about trying to gouge him. In truth, Krux has squandered most of his money and can barely afford to return the balance of Fel's lease payment, let alone pay the extra amount she's demanding.": "菲尔则对党的困境无动于衷，她说如果克鲁斯想要提前拿回他的船，他就必须退还她剩下的租赁费，也就是400金币。克鲁斯说他准备把钱还给她。然而，费尔能感觉到吉夫的绝望，所以她坚持要求对她下一次冒险的收入损失进行补偿，她认为这将是3,000金币。一个成功通过DC15智慧({@skill Insight})检查的角色意识到费尔是在虚张声势--铁皮人秘密地估计她能赚到1000金币就不错了--但她一直怀疑克鲁斯有很深的财力，所以毫不犹豫地想骗他。事实上，克鲁斯已经挥霍了他的大部分钱财，几乎没有能力归还费尔的租赁费余额，更不用说支付她所要求的额外金额了。",
	"Negotiation is not Krux's strong suit, and the giff turns to the characters for help in convincing Fel to let them use the ship. A character can do so by impressing upon her the urgency of the party's mission and succeeding on a DC 18 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation} or {@skill Persuasion}) check. The check is made with advantage if the characters refund the rest of Fel's lease payment (400 gp). If the check fails, Fel is unmoved, and further attempts by that character to sway her fall on deaf ears.": "谈判不是克鲁克斯的强项，吉夫向角色们寻求帮助，以说服费尔让他们使用这艘船。一个角色可以这样做，他要让她对党的任务的紧迫性留下深刻印象，并在DC18魅力（{@skill Intimidation}或{@skill Persuasion}）检查中取得成功。如果角色们退还了Fel的剩余租赁费（400gp），则该检查具有优势。如果检定失败，Fel将不为所动，并且该人物进一步试图动摇她的想法将被置若罔闻。",

	"The kindori keep their distance, staying at least 100 feet away from the crew of the {@i Second Wind}. The kindori are, however, attracted to lights. If the characters don't think of it themselves, Commodore Krux encourages someone to flash or wave a light to get the pod's attention. Flashing or waving a light causes one or two kindori to approach within 15 feet of the light's source while the remaining kindori keep their distance.": "kindori保持距离，至少要与{@i Second Wind}号的船员保持100英尺的距离。然而，kindori会被灯光吸引。如果角色们自己没有想到，克鲁斯准将会鼓励某人闪烁或挥舞灯光来引起吊舱的注意。闪烁或挥舞灯光会使一到两个kindori接近光源的15英尺范围内，而其余的kindori则保持距离。",

For this reason, he orders Flinch to deploy a jolly boat while the {@i Second Wind} remains 100 feet away, its gravity plane aligned with the gravity plane of the asteroid. Flinch uses a winch to lower {@i Big Bluster}, one of the {@i Second Wind}'s jolly boats, into the overlapping gravity planes of Topolah's Tower and the {@i Second Wind}. Characters can use the six oars aboard the jolly boat to propel it to the docks while Krux stands proudly in the bow, pointing to the dock as if the destination were not obvious.": "如果{@i Second Wind}在上一章中丢失了，人物可以乘坐kindori到码头。否则，克鲁斯担心托波拉的码头状况不佳，担心{@i Second Wind}会不小心把它砸成碎片或把它从系泊处扯下来。为此，他命令弗林奇部署一艘欢乐船，而{@i Second Wind}仍在100英尺以外，其重力平面与小行星的重力平面一致。Flinch用绞盘将{@i Second Wind}的欢乐船之一{@i Big Bluster}放进Topolah塔和{@i Second Wind}的重叠引力面。角色们可以使用欢乐船上的六只船桨把它推到码头，而克鲁克斯则骄傲地站在船头，指着码头，好像目的地并不明显。",

	"Gargenhale's tone of voice is inviting, but his dead-black eyes glint with malice. \"It's dangerous out here. That menace from Xaryxis, Commander Vael, keeps sending ships to our system, but we do our part to thin the astral elves' ranks. You're obviously not with them. Care to identify yourselves?\"": "加根哈勒的语气很诱人，但他那双死黑的眼睛却闪烁着恶意的光芒。\"这里很危险。那个来自Xaryxis的威胁，指挥官Vael，不断向我们的系统派船，但我们尽了自己的职责，以减少星界精灵的队伍。你显然不是他们的人。愿意表明你们的身份吗？\"",

	"After making introductions, the vampirate captain confesses that his flagship and its crew are all that remains of his fleet. The rest fell prey to ships under the command of Vael, whom Gargenhale calls the scourge of pirates, raiders, and anyone else who refuses to bow to the might of Xaryxis. Despite these cautionary words, Gargenhale tells any belligerent or opportunistic characters that his crew has already died once—and they won't hesitate to do so again in defense of their ship.": "在做完介绍后，这位吸血鬼船长承认，他的旗舰和它的船员是他的舰队中仅存的。其余的都落入了瓦伊尔指挥的船只之手，加根哈尔称瓦伊尔是海盗、袭击者和其他任何拒绝向Xaryxis的力量低头的人的祸害。尽管有这些警告性的话语，Gargenhale告诉任何好战或投机的人物，他的船员已经死过一次了--他们会毫不犹豫地再次为保护他们的船而死。",
	"In conversation, Gargenhale is placid and convincing, but his words carry the bite of a vampire scorned. He warms quickly to characters who echo his distaste for the Xaryxian Empire.": "在谈话中，加根哈勒平和而令人信服，但他的话却带着被蔑视的吸血鬼的咬痕。他对那些赞同他对Xaryxian帝国的厌恶的人物很快就会感到温暖。",
	"Gargenhale wants to see the Xaryxian Empire crumble, but he's wary of embarking on a voyage to Doomspace alongside a bunch of nobodies.

	"The {@creature young solar dragon|BAM} (see {@book Boo's Astral Menagerie|BAM}) that appeared at the end of the previous session was summoned by Xeleth using Summon Solar Dragon.

	"The real Xeleth is safely aboard the {@i Xaryxia}, one of twelve {@vehicle Star Moth|AAG|star moths} surrounding Vocath's base.

	"Annoyed that the characters have brought Prince Xeleth's fleet to his doorstep, Vocath does all he can to prevent the characters from dragging him deeper into their conflict with the Xaryxian Empire—first by insisting that the characters comply with Xeleth's demands, and then by discouraging the Doomspace factions from doing anything that might escalate the current conflict at his base. If Xedalli is by his side, the mercane quietly and politely suggests that she surrender to her brother without a fight.": "Vocath对角色们将Xeleth王子的舰队带到他家门口感到很恼火，他竭力阻止角色们将他拖入与Xaryxian帝国的冲突中，首先坚持让角色们遵守Xeleth的要求，然后劝阻Doomspace各派别不要做任何可能使他的基地当前的冲突升级的事情。如果塞达利在他身边，雇佣兵会悄悄地、有礼貌地建议她不战而降，向她的哥哥投降。",

	"News of Emperor Xavan's death comes as no surprise to Princess Xedalli. But she knows her brother well enough to assume he's not being entirely truthful about the rest of it. Xedalli clarifies Xeleth's motivation, addressing Vocath and the characters with this reply:": "Xavan皇帝死亡的消息对Xedalli公主来说并不意外。但她很了解她的哥哥，认为他对其余的事情并不完全是真实的。Xedalli澄清了Xeleth的动机，对Vocath和人物做了这样的回答。",

	"Xeleth doesn't deny his sister's accusation, nor do her words change the present situation. Xedalli sees no better option than to accompany her brother back to Xaryxispace. As the encounter unfolds, however, she uses the same trick as Xeleth: she casts {@spell mislead}, turning {@condition invisible} while creating an illusory duplicate of herself. While {@condition invisible}, Xedalli addresses the characters through her illusion and praises them for their heroic attitude while discouraging them from getting involved in Xaryxian politics. While her illusion chatters on, Xedalli surreptitiously removes her {@item ring of shooting stars}, drops it on the sandy arena floor, and uses a {@spell sending} spell to communicate the following information to a character she can trust to act on it:": "Xeleth没有否认他姐姐的指责，她的话也没有改变目前的情况。Xedalli认为除了陪她哥哥回到Xaryxispace之外没有更好的选择。然而，随着遭遇的展开，她使用了与Xeleth相同的招数：她施展了{@spell mislead}，转身{@condition invisible}，同时创造了一个虚幻的自己的副本。当{@condition invisible}时，Xedalli通过她的幻象向人物讲话，赞扬他们的英雄态度，同时劝阻他们不要参与Xaryxian的政治。在她的幻象喋喋不休的时候，Xedalli偷偷地取下她的{@item ring of shooting stars}，把它丢在沙质的竞技场地板上，并使用{@spell sending}法术把以下信息传达给一个她可以信任的人物，让他根据这些信息采取行动。",

	"After giving up her ring, Xedalli moves back into the space occupied by her illusory image and ends her {@spell mislead} spell, making it seem like she was there the whole time.": "在放弃她的戒指后，Xedalli移回她的幻象所占据的空间，并结束她的{@spell mislead}咒语，让人觉得她一直都在那里。",
	"After parting with her ring, Xedalli surrenders to her brother. If Xeleth's solar dragon is still around, it bears her safely to the {@i Xaryxia}, where she is taken into custody. If the characters defeated Xeleth's dragon, Xedalli travels to her brother's ship on the back of another solar dragon she summons for herself. After his sister is aboard the {@i Xaryxia}, Xeleth orders his fleet back to Xaryxispace. As long as Xedalli is his prisoner, Xeleth doesn't care about what happens to her ring.": "在与她的戒指分手后，塞达利向她的兄弟投降。如果Xeleth的太阳龙还在，它就会把她安全地带到{@i Xaryxia}，在那里她会被拘留。如果人物打败了Xeleth的龙，Xedalli就会骑着她为自己召唤的另一条太阳龙前往她哥哥的船上。在他的妹妹登上{@i Xaryxia}号之后，Xeleth命令他的舰队返回Xaryxispace。只要Xedalli是他的俘虏，Xeleth就不会关心她的戒指会发生什么。",
	"If he thinks Xedalli is dead, Xeleth assumes the characters have her ring and demands that it be tossed into his dragon's mouth (so that the dragon can safely transport it back to Xeleth's ship). If his dragon is defeated before it can deliver the ring, Xeleth orders Commander Vael to teleport to Vocath's base with eight {@creature Astral Elf Warrior|BAM|astral elf warriors}, obtain the ring at any cost, and teleport back to the Xaryxia. Vocath, if he's alive, helps the astral elves retrieve the ring. He hopes they'll leave in peace afterward, which they do.": "如果他认为Xedalli已经死了，Xeleth就会认为角色有她的戒指，并要求把它扔到他的龙嘴里（这样龙就可以安全地把它运回Xeleth的船上）。如果他的龙在运送戒指之前被击败，Xeleth命令指挥官Vael用8个{@creature Astral Elf Warrior|BAM|astral elf warriors}传送到Vocath的基地，不惜一切代价获得戒指，然后传送回Xaryxia号。Vocath，如果他还活着，就帮助星际精灵们取回戒指。他希望他们之后能平静地离开，而他们也确实如此。",
	"If Xeleth is unable to obtain Xedalli or her ring, his fleet opens fire on the ships docked at Vocath's base. (These ships are detailed in {@area chapter 8|0d6|x}).

	"If the characters don't speak up, Xedalli tries to mount her own defense, accusing her brother of trying to get rid of her and then fabricating the story of her sedition. It is obvious her words do not move the crowd, however. When Xeleth then tells of finding her engaged in a conspiracy to overthrow him, the crowd boos Xedalli and calls for Xeleth to be crowned emperor. Xedalli, in desperation, demands a chance to prove her innocence in a trial by combat—a request that Xeleth mocks:": "如果这些人物不说话，Xedalli就试图为自己辩护，指责她的哥哥想除掉她，然后编造她叛乱的故事。然而，很明显，她的话并没有打动众人。当Xeleth讲到发现她参与了推翻他的阴谋时，人群对Xedalli报以嘘声，并要求Xeleth加冕为皇帝。Xedalli在绝望中要求有机会在战斗中证明自己的清白--这是Xeleth嘲笑的要求。",

You can run this scenario as a tense series of verbal thrusts and parries, with Xedalli prompting the characters as needed to recount the various episodes of their mission and their grievances against the Xaryxian Empire, while Xeleth attempts to twist every point against them. Resolve this debate by having one of the characters—whichever one is leading the argument in favor of Xedalli's claim to the throne—make a DC 20 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. If another skill seems more appropriate, use that skill instead. If the character's argument is genuinely persuasive or if other characters contribute to the argument, the check is made with advantage. If the check succeeds, the crowd is swayed in Xedalli's favor. If the check fails, the crowd is not swayed, which pleases Xeleth.": "如果这些人物表明他们拥有Xedalli的戒指，他们就有权为公主的王位要求辩护。Xeleth王子被激怒了，试图反驳他们的论点。你可以把这个场景作为一连串紧张的言语攻防战来进行，由Xedalli根据需要提示人物，讲述他们任务的各种情节以及他们对Xaryxian帝国的不满，而Xeleth则试图扭曲每一个不利于他们的观点。解决这场辩论的方法是让其中一个角色--不管是哪个角色在主导支持Xedalli对王位的要求--做一个DC20的魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查。如果其他技能看起来更合适，就用那个技能代替。如果这个角色的论点是真正有说服力的，或者如果其他角色对这个论点有贡献，那么这个检定是有优势的。如果检查成功，众人就会为Xedalli的观点所动摇。如果检查失败，众人就不会被动摇，这让Xeleth很高兴。",

	"Annoyed that the characters have brought {@creature Prince Xeleth|LoX}'s fleet to his doorstep, {@creature Vocath|LoX} does all he can to prevent the characters from dragging him deeper into their conflict with the Xaryxian Empire—first by insisting that the characters comply with Xeleth's demands, and then by discouraging the Doomspace factions from doing anything that might escalate the current conflict at his base.

	"If he thinks Xedalli is dead, Xeleth assumes the characters have her ring and demands that it be tossed into his dragon's mouth (so that the dragon can safely transport it back to Xeleth's ship). If his dragon is defeated before it can deliver the ring, Xeleth orders Commander Vael to teleport to {@creature Vocath|LoX}'s base with eight {@creature Astral Elf Warrior|BAM|astral elf warriors}, obtain the ring at any cost, and teleport back to the Xaryxia. {@creature Vocath|LoX}, if he's alive, helps the astral elves retrieve the ring.

But the character gets a failure on their DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, so Vortshu refuses to join the coalition, perhaps making the argument that the thri-kreen are a greater threat to the aartuks than the Xaryxian Empire.
