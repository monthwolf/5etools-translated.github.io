	"Deep beneath the surface of the world lies the Underdark, a realm of endless labyrinthine tunnels and caverns where the sun never shines. The Underdark is filled with races and creatures too numerous to count or list, and foremost among these are the dark elves—the drow. Hated and feared even by their fellow dwellers in darkness, the drow raid other settlements in the Underdark as well as the surface world, taking prisoners back with them. Rendered {@condition unconscious} with drow poison, then collared and shackled, these prisoners are eventually sold as slaves or entertainment in the dark elves' subterranean cities.": "在世界表面之下的深处是暗黑世界，一个由无尽的迷宫般的隧道和洞穴组成的领域，太阳从不照耀。黑暗世界充满了众多的种族和生物，数也数不清，其中最重要的是黑暗精灵--乌鸦。乌鸦甚至被他们在黑暗中的同伴所憎恨和恐惧，他们袭击了暗黑世界的其他定居点以及表面世界，并将囚犯带回去。这些囚犯被施以鸦人的毒药，然后被戴上项圈和镣铐，最终被卖到黑暗精灵的地下城市作为奴隶或娱乐。",
	"The adventurers have all had the misfortune of falling to such a fate. Captured by the drow, they are prisoners at one of the dark elves' outposts, awaiting transportation to Menzoberranzan, the City of Spiders. Whether they came into the Underdark seeking knowledge or fortune, or were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, they were ripe prey for a drow raid.": "冒险家们都曾不幸落入这样的命运。他们被乌鸦俘虏，在黑暗精灵的某个前哨站成为囚犯，等待被送往蜘蛛之城门索布兰赞。无论他们是来暗黑世界寻求知识或财富，还是在错误的时间出现在错误的地点，他们都是乌鸦突袭的成熟猎物。",
	"The setup of {@i Out of the Abyss} is such that the characters need have no connections with events in the Underdark, or with each other, prior to the start of the adventure. They can meet and get to know each other as prisoners of the drow. Players who would like their characters to have a stronger Underdark connection can choose from the background options in {@adventure appendix A|OotA|17}.": "{@i Out of the Abyss}的设置是这样的：在冒险开始之前，人物不需要与暗黑世界的事件或彼此之间有任何联系。他们可以作为乌鸦的俘虏来认识和了解对方。如果玩家希望他们的角色与暗黑世界有更强的联系，可以从{@adventure appendix A|OotA|17}的背景选项中选择。",
	"\"Prisoners of the Drow\" assumes the characters start at 1st level, and that they will achieve 2nd level (if not 3rd) by the end of this chapter of the adventure. Given the challenges of the adventure and the dangers of the Underdark, you can start the characters at a higher level (2nd or 3rd) to make things a bit easier for the players.": "\"乌鸦的囚徒 \"假设角色从1级开始，在冒险的这一章结束时他们将达到2级（如果不是3级）。考虑到冒险的挑战和地下城的危险，你可以让角色从更高的等级开始（2级或3级），让玩家更容易一些。",
	"The characters' goal in this chapter of the adventure is straightforward: escape from the drow outpost of Velkynvelve, with an eye toward escaping from the Underdark. However, this goal is complicated by the adventurers' lack of familiarity with their surroundings. Even if the prisoners can get away from the drow, where will they go and how will they survive?": "在这一章的冒险中，人物的目标很直接：从维尔基维尔的乌鸦前哨逃出，并着眼于逃离暗黑世界。然而，由于冒险者们对周围环境的不熟悉，这个目标变得很复杂。即使囚犯们能够摆脱乌鸦，他们将去哪里，如何生存？",
	"In addition to being manacled, spellcasters don't have any spell components or focuses, initially limiting their spellcasting ability. (Wizard characters don't need their spellbooks to cast spells, but will be unable to change their prepared spells without them. As such, give wizard characters some leeway in determining which spells they had previously prepared before being captured.) Moreover, spellcasting isn't possible inside the slave pen because of its magical wards (see area 11).": "除了被戴上手铐外，施法者没有任何法术组件或焦点，最初限制了他们的施法能力。(巫师角色不需要他们的法术书来施法，但没有法术书将无法改变他们准备的法术）。因此，在确定他们在被俘之前准备了哪些法术时，要给巫师角色一些余地）。此外，由于奴隶营内有魔法屏障，所以施法是不可能的（见区域11）。",
	"Slipping out of manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check, while breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. A character can unlock the manacles using thieves' tools with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. The manacles have 15 hit points. The iron collars can be broken with a successful DC 20 Strength check. The collars have 12 hit points. A character who fails a check to break a collar, break a set of manacles, or escape from a set of manacles can't attempt checks of that kind again until he or she finishes a long rest. A character can still use the {@action Help} action to aid another character, however.": "溜出手铐需要成功地进行DC20灵巧检查，而打破手铐则需要成功地进行DC20力量检查。一个角色可以用盗贼的工具解开手铐，但需要成功地进行DC 15的灵巧检查。手铐有15个打击点。铁领子可以通过成功的DC20力量检查来打破。项圈有12点生命值。一个角色如果在挣脱项圈、挣脱一套手铐或从一套手铐中逃脱的检查中失败，在他或她完成长时间的休息之前，不能再尝试此类检查。然而，一个角色仍然可以使用{@action Help}动作来帮助另一个角色。",
	"The characters begin the adventure in the slave pens of Velkynvelve. Stripped of everything but their underclothing, they are at the mercy of the dark elves and in the company of other prisoners, many of who aren't what they seem.": "角色们在Velkynvelve的奴隶牢房里开始冒险。他们被剥夺了所有的东西，只剩下内衣，任由黑暗精灵摆布，与其他囚犯为伍，其中许多人并不像他们看起来那样。",
	"Captured by the drow! You wouldn't wish this fate upon anyone, yet here you are—locked in a dark cave, the cold, heavy weight of metal tight around your throat and wrists. You are not alone. Other prisoners are trapped in here with you, in an underground outpost far from the light of the sun. Your captors include a cruel drow priestess who calls herself Mistress Ilvara of House Mizzrym. Over the past several days, you've met her several times, robed in silken garments and flanked by two male drow, one of whom has a mass of scars along one side of his face and neck. Mistress Ilvara likes to impress her will with scourge in hand and remind you that your life now belongs to her. \"Accept your fate, learn to obey, and you may survive.\" Her words echo in your memory, even as you plot your escape.": "被乌鸦抓走了！你不希望任何人遭受这种命运。你不希望任何人遭受这种命运，但你现在却被锁在一个黑暗的山洞里，冰冷、沉重的金属紧紧箍住你的喉咙和手腕。你并不孤单。其他囚犯和你一起被困在这里，在一个远离阳光的地下哨所。俘虏你的人包括一个残酷的鸦人女祭司，她自称是米兹林家族的伊尔瓦拉女主人。在过去的几天里，你见过她好几次，她身穿丝质服装，身旁有两个男性乌鸦，其中一个的脸部和脖子一侧有大量的伤疤。女主人伊尔瓦拉喜欢用手中的鞭子打动她的意志，并提醒你，你的生命现在属于她了。\"接受你的命运，学会服从，你就可能活下来。\" 她的话在你的记忆中回响，甚至在你策划逃跑的时候。",
	"Assume that each player character has been a prisoner in Velkynvelve for {@dice 1d10} days. (Roll separately for each character.) The characters spend most of this time locked in the slave pen, emerging occasionally under heavy guard to perform menial chores for their captors' amusement (see \"Hard Labor\").": "假设每个玩家角色在Velkynvelve当了{@dice 1d10}天的囚犯。(每个角色都要单独计算。)这些角色大部分时间都被关在奴隶栏里，偶尔会在重兵把守下出现，做一些琐碎的家务，供俘虏们取乐（见 \"苦役\"）。",
	"Velkynvelve's slave pen is closed with a heavy iron gate bolted into the stone. See area 11 for more information about the slave pen, including options for opening or breaking through the gate.": "维尔基维尔的奴隶围栏是用一扇沉重的铁门栓在石头上封闭的。关于奴隶营的更多信息，包括打开或突破铁门的方案，请参见第11区。",
	"The prisoners are provided with clay chamber pots, and one of the duties of slaves is to empty them into the pool during their shift. There are no other comforts in the slave pen. Prisoners must sit or lie on the stone floor, and are fed only once each day—a thin mushroom broth served in small clay bowls passed through gaps in the bars of the gate.": "囚犯们被提供了粘土箱，奴隶们的职责之一是在轮班时将其倒入水池。奴隶牢房里没有其他舒适的地方。囚犯必须坐在或躺在石板上，每天只吃一次饭--用小土碗盛着稀薄的蘑菇汤，从大门的栅栏缝隙中穿过。",
	"The player characters have not been idle during their captivity. Have each player roll a {@dice d20}, and add the number of days ({@dice 1d10}) that player's character has been imprisoned in Velkynvelve. The result determines what, if anything, the character has in his or her possession when the adventure begins.": "玩家的角色在被囚禁期间并没有闲着。让每个玩家掷出{@dice d20}，然后加上该玩家的角色被囚禁在Velkynvelve的天数({@dice 1d10})。这个结果决定了冒险开始时，该角色拥有什么，如果有的话。",

	"A male {@creature derro|MTF}, {@creature Buppido|OotA} is surprisingly gregarious and talkative, demonstrating a keen mind and a disarming manner. This pleasant facade conceals the soul of an insane killer. {@creature Buppido|OotA} secretly believes he is the living incarnation of the derro god Diinkarazan—an avatar of murder offering bloody sacrifices to create a path of carnage through the Underdark for his people to follow to glory. He rationalizes any setbacks (including his capture and imprisonment) as part of his \"divine plan.\" His killings are carefully ritualized, following an exacting process of cutting open the victims and arranging their organs.": "一个男性{@creature derro|MTF}，{@creature Buppido|OotA}出人意料地好客和健谈，表现出敏锐的头脑和迷人的态度。这种令人愉快的外表下隐藏着一个疯狂的杀手的灵魂。{@creature Buppido|OotA}秘密地相信他是德鲁神Diinkarazan的活生生的化身--谋杀的化身，提供血腥的牺牲，为他的人民创造一条穿越暗黑世界的屠杀之路，以获得荣耀。他把任何挫折（包括他的被捕和监禁）都合理化为他 \"神圣计划 \"的一部分。他的杀戮是仔细的仪式化的，遵循严格的过程，切开受害者并排列他们的器官。",
	"Although Derendil behaves like the highborn prince he believes himself to be, he responds to stress—and particularly threats—like a quaggoth: violently tearing foes limb from limb and rending their flesh with sharp claws and teeth. He comes back to himself only after battle, or when someone reinforces his \"true identity\" to snap him out of it. Derendil laments that he is slowly but surely losing himself to the savagery of his quaggoth form.": "虽然德兰迪尔的行为就像他认为自己是高高在上的王子，但他对压力的反应--尤其是对威胁的反应--就像夸父一样：猛烈地将敌人的肢体撕裂，用锋利的爪子和牙齿撕碎他们的肉。只有在战斗结束后，或者当有人强化他的 \"真实身份 \"使他摆脱这种状态时，他才会恢复自我。德兰迪尔哀叹说，他正在慢慢地但肯定地失去自己，被他的夸父形态的野蛮所取代。",
	"In fact, Derendil is simply mad, touched by the delusions of the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu. The kingdom of Nelrindenvane doesn't exist, and all of \"Derendil's\" recollections and personality are an illusion created by the Demon Prince of Deception. The quaggoth refuses to believe the truth, and any incontrovertible evidence as to his real nature sends him into a murderous rage.": "事实上，Derendil只是疯了，被恶魔领主Fraz-Urb'luu的错觉所触动。内尔林登凡王国并不存在，所有 \"德兰迪尔 \"的回忆和个性都是由欺骗的恶魔王子创造的幻觉。夸父拒绝相信真相，任何关于他真实本性的无可争议的证据都会让他陷入杀戮的愤怒之中。",
	"Eldeth wants to get back home, but she is also defiant and self sacrificing—and therefore among the most likely prisoners to perish before getting the opportunity. If that happens, Eldeth asks a character she trusts to promise to carry word of her fate back to her family in Gauntlgrym, along with her shield and warhammer if they are recovered. This might win the characters the approval of Eldeth's kin when they later visit Gauntlgrym.": "埃尔德斯想回家，但她也是个挑衅和自我牺牲的人--因此是最有可能在得到机会之前丧生的囚犯之一。如果发生这种情况，埃尔德斯要求一个她信任的角色承诺将她的命运带回去给她在Gauntlgrym的家人，如果她的盾牌和战锤被找回来的话。这可能会使角色在以后访问Gauntlgrym时赢得Eldeth的亲属的认可。",
	"{@creature Jimjar|OotA} is always true to his word, and he manages to keep exact track of his debits and credits in his head, paying up on his bets (or demanding payment) as soon as possible. He's not above pocketing a little extra coin when no one is watching, and he has an amazing ability to secret significant wealth on his person.": "{@creature Jimjar|OotA}总是言出必行，他设法在脑子里准确地记录下他的借贷情况，尽快付清他的赌注（或要求付款）。他不惜在没人注意的情况下多掏一点钱，而且他有一种惊人的能力，可以将大量的财富藏在自己身上。",
	"{@creature Jimjar|OotA} feels as though there's something odd about the twins {@creature Topsy|OotA} and {@creature Turvy|OotA}, but he keeps his opinion to himself unless asked. He does his best to get along with everyone, although some find his gregariousness and constant wagers grating.": "{@creature Jimjar|OotA}觉得这对双胞胎{@creature Topsy|OotA}和{@creature Turvy|OotA}好像有些奇怪，但除非被问到，否则他不会发表自己的意见。他尽力与每个人相处，尽管有些人觉得他的好客和不断的赌注令人厌烦。",

	"Unknown even to the other drow, Sarith is infected with tainted spores from myconids corrupted by Zuggtmoy, the Demon Queen of Fungi. The initial infestation of the spores caused Sarith's bout of madness, and his health and sanity continue to deteriorate as the spores grow within his brain.": "甚至连其他乌鸦都不知道，萨利斯被真菌女王祖格莫伊腐蚀的霉菌孢子所感染了。最初孢子的侵袭导致了萨利斯的疯狂，随着孢子在他大脑中的生长，他的健康和理智也在不断恶化。",
	"A {@creature kuo-toa}, Shuushar is likely to be one of the more unusual creatures any of the adventurers have met. The aquatic hermit is a calm and peaceful presence. He is aware of his people's well-deserved reputation for madness, and claims to have spent a lifetime in contemplation and solitary meditation to overcome that legacy. He appears to have been successful, exuding an aura of enlightened balance. Shuushar is even calm and accepting of his current imprisonment, merely saying that it is what it is, and who can say what end it might eventually lead toward?": "舒沙是冒险家们遇到过的最不寻常的生物之一，他是一个{@creature kuo-toa}。这个水生隐士是一个平静而和平的存在。他知道他的族人当之无愧的疯狂名声，并声称自己花了一生的时间来沉思和单独冥想，以克服这种遗产。他似乎已经成功了，散发着一种开明平衡的光环。舒沙甚至平静地接受了他目前的监禁，只是说它就是这样，谁能说它最终会导致什么结果呢？",
	"Although Shuushar is by far the most sane, stable, and honest of the adventurers' fellow prisoners, he is also the most useless to their immediate goals. The kuo-toa hermit is a complete pacifist. He doesn't fight or cause harm to any other creature, even refusing to defend himself or others. He gladly accompanies the party if permitted to do so, however, helping them in any way he can other than violating his most sacred vow.": "虽然舒沙是迄今为止冒险家们的同伴中最理智、最稳定、最诚实的囚犯，但他也是对他们的直接目标最无用的。这个Kuo-toa隐士是一个完全的和平主义者。他不打架，也不伤害任何其他生物，甚至拒绝为自己或他人辩护。然而，如果被允许的话，他很乐意与党一起，以任何方式帮助他们，而不是违反他最神圣的誓言。",
	"Shuushar is familiar with Sloobludop, the kuo-toa town near the Darklake, and has navigated the twisting routes of the Darklake for many years. He hopes to share his enlightenment with his fellow kuo-toa, although he isn't aware of recent events in Sloobludop (see {@area chapter 3|112|x} for details).": "舒沙对黑暗之湖附近的国土镇Sloobludop很熟悉，多年来一直在黑暗之湖的曲折路线上摸索。他希望能与他的国土伙伴分享他的启蒙，尽管他并不清楚最近在斯洛布洛普发生的事件（详情见{@area chapter 3|112|x}）。",
	"{@creature Stool|OotA} is a {@creature myconid sprout} captured by {@creature Sarith Kzekarit|OotA}. {@creature Stool|OotA} is lonely and {@condition frightened}, wanting only to return to its home in Neverlight Grove. If befriended by the characters, {@creature Stool|OotA} gladly offers to guide them to its home, promising them sanctuary with its folk, although it isn't aware of the dangers posed by Zuggtmoy's influence on the myconids (see {@adventure chapter 5|OotA|4}).": "{@creature Stool|OotA}是一个被{@creature Sarith Kzekarit|OotA}捕获的{@creature myconid sprout}。{@creature Stool|OotA}很孤独，{@condition frightened}，只想回到它在Neverlight Grove的家。如果被人物结识，{@creature Stool|OotA}会很乐意引导他们去它的家，答应他们与它的族人一起避难，尽管它不知道Zuggtmoy对菌类的影响所带来的危险（见{@adventure chapter 5|OotA|4}）。",
	"{@creature Stool|OotA} uses rapport spores to establish telepathic communication with other creatures, and it does so to communicate with characters who are kind and friendly toward it. The myconid will also help establish communication with Underdark denizens with whom the characters don't share a language. Once it becomes attached to one or more of the adventurers, {@creature Stool|OotA} behaves somewhat like an enthusiastic and curious younger sibling, sticking close to the characters and asking all kinds of questions.": "{@creature Stool|OotA}使用默契孢子与其他生物建立心灵感应，它这样做是为了与那些对它友好的角色交流。菌类也会帮助与那些与角色没有共同语言的地下城居民建立沟通。一旦它与一个或多个冒险者有了感情，（1%）就会表现得有点像一个热情而好奇的弟弟妹妹，紧紧地贴着人物，问各种各样的问题。",
	"Twin deep gnomes, {@creature Topsy|OotA} and her brother {@creature Turvy|OotA} are originally from Blingdenstone in the Underdark. They were captured by the drow while out gathering mushrooms in the tunnels near their home. Like most other svirfneblin, {@creature Topsy|OotA} has a stringy mop of hair while {@creature Turvy|OotA} only has a few tufts of hair atop his otherwise bald head. {@creature Topsy|OotA} is by far the more social of the two. {@creature Turvy|OotA} constantly mumbles and mutters darkly, with {@creature Topsy|OotA} repeating or translating what her brother says.": "双胞胎深层地精，{@creature Topsy|OotA}和她的兄弟{@creature Turvy|OotA}最初来自暗黑世界的布林登石。他们在家乡附近的隧道里采集蘑菇时被乌鸦抓走。像大多数其他的斯维尔芬布林一样，{@creature Topsy|OotA}有一撮头发，而{@creature Turvy|OotA}在他原本光秃秃的头上只有几束头发。到目前为止，{@creature Topsy|OotA}是两个人中比较善于交际的一个。{@creature Turvy|OotA}经常喃喃自语，暗自嘀咕，{@creature Topsy|OotA}重复或翻译她哥哥的话。",
	"{@creature Topsy|OotA} and {@creature Turvy|OotA} hide the fact that they are {@creature Wererat||wererats}. Infected with the curse of lycanthropy, neither deep gnome has entirely embraced it yet, and they struggle to control their wererat instincts and urges. They are fearful of what potential allies might do if they learn the truth, and are looking out for each other and their own survival. With their transformations controlled by the unseen cycle of the moon, you can use the twins' impending change as a wild card in the adventure. They've been prisoners for less than a month, meaning the full moon is coming.": "{@creature Topsy|OotA}和{@creature Turvy|OotA}隐藏了他们是{@creature Wererat||wererats}的事实。感染了狼人的诅咒，两个深山地精都还没有完全接受它，他们努力控制自己的狼人本能和冲动。他们害怕潜在的盟友在得知真相后会做出什么事来，他们正在为彼此和自己的生存着想。由于他们的转变受到看不见的月亮周期的控制，你可以把这对双胞胎即将发生的变化作为冒险中的一张底牌。他们被囚禁了不到一个月，意味着满月即将到来。",
	"The other prisoners who manage to escape with the player characters are likely to become their companions for a substantial part of the adventure, so it is good to lay the groundwork for those relationships early on. Some of the NPCs might not survive the initial escape attempt. Others might be lost to the dangers of the Underdark—or might reveal their true colors and betray the party. A few could become true companions. Keep in mind the other prisoners have their own personalities and goals, but are generally willing to cooperate for their own benefit. Their knowledge of the Underdark should encourage the player characters to keep them around at least initially.": "与玩家角色一起逃脱的其他囚犯可能会在冒险的大部分时间里成为他们的同伴，所以在早期为这些关系打下基础是很好的。有些NPC可能无法在最初的逃跑尝试中存活下来。其他人可能会在暗黑世界的危险中迷失方向，或者可能暴露出他们的真面目并背叛队伍。有几个可能成为真正的伙伴。请记住，其他囚犯有他们自己的个性和目标，但一般都愿意为自己的利益而合作。他们对暗黑世界的了解应该鼓励玩家角色至少在开始时把他们留在身边。",
	"Since managing such a large cast of NPCs can be quite involved, enlist the aid of the players if you wish, having each of them take on the role of managing one or more of the party's companions. The player generally decides what that NPC is doing, with the knowledge that you, as Dungeon Master, can overrule them as needed by the story. Not only does this make the secondary characters easier to manage, it helps the players get to know them and strengthens the bonds between the NPCs and the adventurers.": "由于管理这么多的NPC可能会很麻烦，如果你愿意的话，可以争取玩家的帮助，让他们每个人都扮演管理一个或多个聚会同伴的角色。一般来说，玩家决定该NPC在做什么，而作为地牢主管的你可以根据故事的需要否决他们。这不仅使次要角色更容易管理，而且有助于玩家了解他们，加强NPC和冒险者之间的联系。",
	"You might wish to consult the social interaction rules in the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}, in which case the other prisoners are initially indifferent toward the characters. Handle the interactions using roleplaying, Charisma checks, or a balance of the two as best suits your group and the way the adventure unfolds.": "你可能希望参考{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}中的社会互动规则，在这种情况下，其他囚犯最初对这些角色是无动于衷的。使用角色扮演、魅力检查或两者的平衡来处理互动，这最适合你的小组和冒险的展开方式。",
	"The characters can learn the following things from talking with their fellow prisoners, some of who have been captives of the drow for a tenday or two:": "角色们可以从与同伴的交谈中了解到以下内容，其中一些人已经被乌鸦俘虏了一两天了。",
	"There are nineteen drow at the outpost, including Ilvara, Shoor, and Jorlan, as well as another priestess named Asha. There are also a dozen quaggoths and a number of giant spiders.": "前哨站有十九个鸦人，包括伊尔瓦拉、肖尔和乔兰，以及另一个叫阿莎的女祭司。还有十几只夸父和一些巨型蜘蛛。",

	"The drow divide their prisoners into three roughly equal-sized groups and put them to work for a third of the day, supervised by the quaggoths. Their menial tasks include filling and hauling water barrels, operating the lift, cleaning any or all parts of the outpost (whether they need it or not), emptying chamber pots, food preparation and service, washing dishes, and laundry. The prisoners are also given cruel or pointless tasks to occupy them, and for the dark elves' amusement. Such labors include moving or stacking rocks, coiling ropes, and organizing supplies, with prisoners forced to redo work that doesn't meet the drow's arbitrary standards.": "乌鸦把他们的囚犯分成三个大小大致相同的小组，让他们在夸父的监督下工作一天的三分之一。他们的琐碎任务包括填充和拖动水桶、操作电梯、清洁前哨的任何或所有部分（无论他们是否需要）、清空室内的盆子、准备食物和服务、洗碗和洗衣。囚犯们也会被赋予残酷或无意义的任务，以占据他们的时间，并供黑暗精灵们娱乐。这类劳动包括移动或堆放岩石、盘绕绳索、整理物资，囚犯们被迫重做不符合乌鸦任意标准的工作。",
	"Characters might or might not work together, depending on how the drow split them up. Prisoners known to be friendly to each other are usually kept apart, and no more than two or three prisoners are allowed to work at a single task at once.": "角色可能在一起工作，也可能不在一起工作，这取决于鸦人如何将他们分开。已知彼此友好的囚犯通常会被分开，而且不允许超过两到三个囚犯同时从事一项工作。",
	"The drow and quaggoths are cruel and capricious, but also somewhat bored and looking for amusement. The quaggoths are poor conversationalists, hateful and mistrustful toward the prisoners. The drow are more inclined to talk, if only to boast of their superiority. Characters might trick them into dropping useful bits of information, such as how long the journey to Menzoberranzan is expected to take, or that the outpost is relatively close to the Darklake.": "乌鸦和食人魔残忍而任性，但也有些无聊，想找点乐子。奎格斯人不善言谈，对囚犯充满仇恨和不信任。鸦人更倾向于交谈，如果只是为了夸耀他们的优越性的话。角色可能会骗他们说出一些有用的信息，比如去门索布兰赞的旅程预计需要多长时间，或者前哨站离黑暗湖比较近。",
	"The characters' sleep in the slave pen is troubled and fitful, filled with strange dreams and disturbing images. Dark shadows seem to move and reach out toward them as the characters wander lost through endless mazes of tunnels. Oily tentacles slide to brush up against them, while a great buzzing and howling rises in the distance. Suppurating wounds burst open in clouds of spores or crawling masses of maggots or insects. At least one or more of the characters should wake in a cold sweat from these nightmares after every rest, feeling as though something is out there in the dark depths—something far worse than the drow.": "奴隶营中的人物的睡眠是混乱和不稳定的，充满了奇怪的梦和令人不安的图像。当人物在无尽的隧道迷宫中迷失方向时，黑暗的阴影似乎在移动，并向他们伸出手来。油腻的触手滑向他们，而远处传来巨大的嗡嗡声和嚎叫。化脓的伤口在孢子云或爬行的蛆虫或昆虫群中爆裂开来。每次休息后，至少有一个或多个角色应该从这些噩梦中惊醒，感觉好像有什么东西在黑暗的深处--远比乌鸦更可怕。",
	"You need not explain the cause of these dreams and images at this time. Characters can chalk them up to the conditions in the slave pen, or to the aftereffects of drow poison, but they are omens of what is happening in the Underdark. Spellcasters, particularly clerics and warlocks, might be most prone to these dreams, but they can visit any or all of the characters.": "你现在不需要解释这些梦和图像的原因。角色们可以把它们归结为奴隶监狱的条件，或归结为鸦人毒药的后遗症，但它们是暗黑世界正在发生的事情的预兆。施法者，尤其是牧师和术士，可能最容易做这些梦，但它们可以拜访任何或所有角色。",
	"Most of the other prisoners aren't looking for trouble, and even killers such as {@creature Buppido|OotA} are careful to bide their time. Still, both Derendil and {@creature Ront|OotA} have quick tempers, and Sarith the drow is prone to bouts of violence as Zuggtmoy's spores take over his mind. It's possible the characters could provoke a fight. If they do, some of the prisoners (including the deep gnomes) egg on the fighters while others keep their distance or even try to break up the brawl.": "大多数其他的囚犯并不是在找麻烦，即使是像{@creature Buppido|OotA}这样的杀手也会小心翼翼地等待时机。不过，德兰迪尔和(1%)都有急躁的脾气，而乌鸦人萨利斯在祖格莫伊的孢子占据他的头脑时，很容易发生暴力行为。这些人物有可能挑起一场战斗。如果他们这样做了，一些囚犯（包括深层地精）就会对战士们大打出手，而其他人则会保持距离，甚至试图打破争吵的局面。",
	"Any violent conflict draws the attention of the drow guards, who initially order any prisoners to stand down from a fight, threatening them with hand crossbows from outside the gate. If necessary, they shoot prisoners with poisoned crossbow bolts to incapacitate them. (See {@book chapter 8|DMG|8|Poisons} of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} for information on drow poison.) The guards let any fight play out for their own amusement as long as the prisoners don't seem likely to actually kill one another.": "任何暴力冲突都会引起鸦人守卫的注意，他们最初会命令任何囚犯从战斗中退下，在门外用手弩威胁他们。如果有必要，他们会用带毒的弩箭射杀囚犯，使他们丧失能力。(关于乌鸦毒药的信息，请看{@book chapter 8|DMG|8|Poisons}的{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}。只要囚犯看起来不可能真的互相残杀，守卫们就会让任何争斗上演，供他们自己取乐。",
	"This event is a convenient opportunity to get rid of one or more of the other prisoners before the escape attempt if you don't want them around. As well, you can drive home the cruelty and threat of the drow by eliminating an NPC with whom the characters have formed a bond.": "如果你不希望其他囚犯在你身边，这个事件是一个方便的机会，可以在逃跑前除掉他们中的一个或多个。此外，你还可以通过消灭一个与角色建立了联系的NPC，让他们明白鸦人的残酷和威胁。",

	"The commander of Velkynvelve is an ambitious drow priestess looking to rise in the esteem of Lolth and her house. She considers command of a mere outpost a stepping stone in her ascension. The posting is beneath her, and she treats both it and her prisoners with contempt. But she also knows the posting is temporary, and she intends to wring every advantage from it in the meantime.": "Velkynvelve的指挥官是一位雄心勃勃的乌鸦女祭司，希望在洛尔思和她的家族中获得提升。她认为指挥一个普通的前哨站是她升迁的垫脚石。这个职位在她之下，她对这个职位和她的囚犯都很蔑视。但她也知道这个职位是暂时的，她打算在这期间从它身上榨取一切好处。",
	"A junior drow priestess under Ilvara's guidance, Asha initially considered Ilvara an example to emulate. That changed after she saw how Ilvara treated Jorlan Duskryn, a seasoned drow warrior who was the commander's lover up until he was badly wounded. Ilvara discarded Jorlan without a second thought, showing Asha the foolishness of expecting any reward for loyalty.": "作为伊尔瓦拉指导下的初级鸦人女祭司，阿莎最初认为伊尔瓦拉是一个可以效仿的榜样。在她看到伊尔瓦拉如何对待乔兰-杜斯克林之后，情况发生了变化，乔兰是一名经验丰富的乌鸦战士，在他受重伤之前一直是指挥官的情人。伊尔瓦拉不假思索地抛弃了乔兰，向阿莎展示了期望为忠诚获得任何回报的愚蠢行为。",
	"Asha is ambitious enough to know she could assume command of the outpost if anything was to happen to Ilvara, but not courageous enough to challenge her superior openly. She also knows that she would have to impress her superiors in the City of Spiders for any such field promotion to become permanent. As such, Asha moves cautiously, fanning the fires of Jorlan's hatred while keeping her own hands clean of any plotting.": "阿莎有足够的野心，知道如果伊尔瓦拉出了什么事，她可以担任前哨的指挥，但没有勇气公开挑战她的上司。她还知道，她必须给她在蜘蛛城的上级留下深刻印象，才能使任何这样的实地晋升成为永久性的。因此，阿莎的行动很谨慎，在为乔兰的仇恨煽风点火的同时，保持自己的手不受任何阴谋的影响。",
	"This drow elite warrior has assumed the role of Ilvara's lieutenant and lover after the injuries suffered by his predecessor, Jorlan Duskryn. Shoor is relatively young and quite arrogant for a drow male, proud of his abilities and accomplishments. He is still flush with his success in winning the favor of Ilvara and advancing his position Twithin the outpost, which shows in his swagger and the way he lords it over every other male in Velkynvelve, particularly Jorlan. Still insecure in his position, Shoor feels the need to demonstrate his skill and effectiveness to his mistress and to find ways to please her.": "在他的前任乔兰-杜斯克林受伤后，这位鸦人精英战士承担了伊尔瓦拉的副手和情人的角色。肖尔比较年轻，作为一个鸦人男性，他相当傲慢，对自己的能力和成就感到骄傲。他还在为自己成功赢得伊尔瓦拉的青睐和提升自己在前哨站的地位而感到兴奋，这表现在他的豪迈和他对维尔基维尔其他男性的支配方式上，尤其是乔兰。肖尔对自己的地位仍然没有安全感，他觉得有必要向他的女主人展示他的技能和效率，并想办法取悦她。",
	"Jorlan turned a talent for inflicting pain into skill as a warrior, and a certain roguish charm into a way to ingratiate himself with his female superiors. He quickly made himself useful to {@creature Ilvara Mizzrym|OotA} as both the field commander of the Velkynvelve garrison and as her lover, enjoying all the benefits that came with both roles.": "乔兰把施加痛苦的天赋变成了战士的技能，把某种无赖的魅力变成了讨好女上司的方法。他很快就使自己变得对{@creature Ilvara Mizzrym|OotA}有用，既是Velkynvelve驻军的战地指挥官，又是她的情人，享受这两个角色带来的所有好处。",
	"Jorlan thought that Lolth favored him, or at least that his charms had deflected her malice, until he had the misfortune of a run-in with a black pudding on an otherwise routine raid. Ilvara's healing magic saved his life but couldn't undo the terrible damage wrought by the ooze's acid. With his once-handsome face melted and scarred, and his sword hand twisted and missing two fingers, Jorlan was no longer the warrior he once was.": "Jorlan认为Lolth偏爱他，或者至少他的魅力转移了她的恶意，直到他在一次普通的突袭中不幸与黑布丁发生冲突。伊尔瓦拉的治疗魔法救了他的命，但却无法消除渗出物的酸液所造成的可怕伤害。他曾经英俊的脸庞被融化，伤痕累累，他的剑手被扭曲，失去了两根手指，乔兰不再是他曾经的战士。",
	"Ilvara relieved Jorlan of duty during his recuperation, replacing him with the young bravo Shoor Vandree. When she then took Shoor to her bed, Jorlan realized his recovery would never be sufficient to regain what he had lost. His heartbreak and loss has since become a virulent hatred for Ilvara and Shoor that slowly eats at him. Jorlan finds the idea of suicide or reckless self-destruction beneath him, however—unless he can find a way to take Ilvara and her new lover with him.": "伊尔瓦拉在乔兰休养期间解除了他的职务，用年轻的勇者肖尔-范德里取代了他。当她把Shoor带到她的床上时，Jorlan意识到他的恢复永远不足以恢复他所失去的。他的心碎和失落从此变成了对伊尔瓦拉和肖尔的强烈仇恨，慢慢吞噬着他。然而，Jorlan发现自杀或不计后果的自我毁灭的想法在他之下--除非他能找到一种方法把Ilvara和她的新情人带走。",
	"Jorlan knows full well that the sympathy the priestess Asha shows him is an attempt to manipulate him. But he's willing to play along for the time being, hoping to draw Asha closer and potentially use her against Ilvara when the time is right.": "Jorlan清楚地知道，女祭司Asha对他的同情是在试图操纵他。但他愿意暂时配合，希望能拉近阿莎的距离，并在时机成熟时可能利用她来对付伊尔瓦拉。",
	"Because of his injuries, Jorlan has disadvantage on attack rolls, Dexterity checks, and Dexterity saving throws.": "由于他的伤势，乔兰在攻击卷、灵巧检查和灵巧投掷方面都处于劣势。",
	"The remaining drow males garrisoning Velkynvelve are named Balok, Bemeril, Guldor, Honemmeth, Imbros, Jaezred, Jevan, Kalannar, Malagar, Nadal, Nym, and Sorn.": "驻扎在维尔金维尔的其余乌鸦男性名叫巴洛克、贝梅里尔、古尔多、霍内梅斯、英布罗斯、杰兹瑞德、杰万、卡拉纳、马拉加、纳达尔、尼姆和索恩。",
	"The drow are arrogant, cruel, and vicious, viewing their slaves as little more than livestock and treating them with cold disregard. Even the lowest drow understands the inferiority of other creatures, behaving toward the prisoners like sneering nobility. With their superiors, however, the drow are fawning sycophants with a passive-aggressive edge. The males defer to the females, the rank-and-file warriors defer to the elite warriors, and everyone defers to the priestess Ilvara.": "乌鸦人傲慢、残忍、恶毒，把他们的奴隶看成不过是牲畜，对他们冷眼旁观。即使是最低级的乌鸦也明白其他生物的劣势，对囚犯的行为就像讥讽的贵族。然而，对于他们的上级，乌鸦是带着消极攻击性的媚俗的佞人。男性服从于女性，普通战士服从于精英战士，而每个人都服从于女祭司伊尔瓦拉。",
	"The drow outpost is located high in a cavern, built 100 feet above the rocky floor. The outpost consists of a series of small caves in the cavern walls and four \"hanging towers\"—hollowed-out stalactites connected by walkways, stairs, and rope bridges. The towers are concealed by the thick webs of giant spiders stretched below them, so that only the lowermost parts of the stalactites are visible from the cavern floor.": "乌鸦的前哨站位于洞穴的高处，建在岩石地面之上100英尺处。前哨站由洞壁上的一系列小洞穴和四座 \"吊塔 \"组成--中空的钟乳石由人行道、楼梯和绳桥连接。这些塔楼被下面延伸的巨型蜘蛛的厚厚的网所掩盖，因此从洞穴的地面上只能看到钟乳石的最下层部分。",
	"With the small amount of dim light used in the outpost shielded from the cavern floor below, one might walk the entire length of the cleft without becoming aware of the outpost overhead, hidden in the darkness above the range of torches and lanterns. The giant spiders also serve as guards, dropping down on their web strands to prey upon creatures that find their way into the cavern. Similarly, drow warriors can drop to the cave floor on lines of spider silk to ambush enemies.": "由于前哨站使用的少量昏暗光线被下面的洞穴地板所遮挡，人们可能会走完整个裂缝而不会意识到头顶上的前哨站，它隐藏在火把和灯笼范围以上的黑暗中。巨型蜘蛛也充当着守卫的角色，用它们的网线落下，捕食发现进入洞穴的生物。同样地，乌鸦战士可以踩着蛛丝线落到洞底，伏击敌人。",
	"Three caves and two hanging towers surrounding a platform make up the main part of the outpost for the drow warriors. The largest of the hanging towers is reserved for the priestesses and the shrine of Lolth, while the other is a guard tower opposite the cave used to hold slaves. North of the slave pen is the den of the outpost's quaggoth servants. Watch posts lie at either end of the outpost, near the northern and southern entrances to the cavern.": "三个洞穴和两个围绕着平台的吊塔构成了鸦人战士的前哨站的主要部分。最大的吊塔是为女祭司和洛尔思神殿保留的，而另一个则是用于关押奴隶的山洞对面的警卫塔。奴隶围栏的北面是前哨站的夸哥特仆人的洞穴。哨所位于前哨的两端，靠近洞穴的北部和南部入口。",

	"This cave serves as a gathering and eating place for the drow warriors of the outpost. It has four circular tables carved from zurkhwood, each surrounded by five chairs.

	"What equipment and treasures the characters claim during their escape depend on how much of the outpost they are able to explore before fleeing. For some characters, it might be a fun challenge to escape into the Underdark with little more than the clothes on their backs.

The escapees can jump down into the webs below, then over the edge into the pool, making their escape from there.": "如果答案是肯定的，乔兰迅速而悄悄地提议不锁上通往奴隶圈的大门，并在换岗时制造分心。他告诉人物关于军械库的情况，军械库位于奴隶围栏前的悬空警卫塔的岗哨上方的密室中。逃跑的人可以跳到下面的网里，然后从边缘跳到水池里，从那里逃跑。",
	"Jorlan furtively glances around as he speaks quickly to the characters. If they question him or ask for changes to the plan, he insists it is all he can do.

The demons' arrival catches all of the drow off guard.": "在换岗时，囚犯们听到可怕的嗡嗡声在洞穴里回荡，接着是非人的尖叫声。当四个{@creature chasme}恶魔追赶一对{@creature vrock}恶魔从北部通道进入洞穴时，警报喇叭响了起来。恶魔们俯冲着，嗡嗡作响，最初无视其他生物，因为两组恶魔都在野蛮地攻击对方。恶魔们的到来让所有的乌鸦都措手不及。",
	"The drow rush to defend the outpost from a possible attack. The demons initially buzz past the hanging towers, leaving the walkways and caverns out of range of the effects of their droning and screeching. However, drow and quaggoths in the towers are close enough to be affected. The aerial battle eventually circles around the platform and the towers of the elite warriors as the demons savagely tear into each other.": "乌鸦们匆匆忙忙地保卫前哨站，以免受到可能的攻击。恶魔们最初从悬空的塔楼上嗡嗡作响，将走道和洞穴排除在它们的叨叨声和尖叫声的影响范围之外。然而，塔楼里的乌鸦和夸父都很近，足以受到影响。空中战斗最终围绕着平台和精锐战士的塔楼展开，因为恶魔们野蛮地撕咬着对方。",
	"The drow move to engage the demons and defend the outpost, leaving the characters with an opportunity to escape. You can combine this event with Jorlan's offer to leave the gate unlocked, making it easy for the characters to slip away. Alternatively (or if they refuse Jorlan's offer), the characters can use the distraction to engineer their own breakout, then decide how to get down to the cavern floor and where to go after that.": "乌鸦人开始与恶魔交战并保卫前哨，给角色们留下了逃跑的机会。你可以将这一事件与乔兰的提议结合起来，让大门不上锁，让角色们很容易溜走。另外（或者如果他们拒绝了乔兰的提议），角色们可以利用这次分心来设计自己的突围，然后决定如何下到洞穴的地板上，之后去哪里。",

Indeed, one of the primary reasons for the party to visit known settlements in the Underdark is to acquire proper equipment and provisions.": "角色们手上的装备取决于他们在逃离Velkynvelve时能够打捞或偷窃到的东西。事实上，他们访问地下城中已知的定居点的主要原因之一是为了获得适当的装备和供给。",
	"Characters can use downtime during their travels to craft equipment, provided they are proficient with the necessary tools and have access to them (see \"{@book Downtime Activities|PHB|8|Downtime Activities}\" in chapter 8 of the {@i Player's Handbook}). Having to improvise tools doubles the crafting time, and some items require materials that are hard to find in the Underdark, including wood and other surface-world plants. Leather, bone, or zurkhwood (see \"{@area Fungi of the Underdark|067|x}\" later in this chapter) might substitute in some cases. Crafting can include modifying scavenged or salvaged items to fit other needs, such as creating a makeshift suit of armor from gathered pieces of armor and other materials.": "角色可以利用旅行中的休息时间制作装备，只要他们精通必要的工具并能获得这些工具（见《{@i Player's Handbook}》第八章中的\"{@book Downtime Activities|PHB|8|Downtime Activities}\"）。必须即兴制作工具会使制作时间翻倍，而且有些物品需要在暗黑世界难以找到的材料，包括木材和其他地表世界的植物。在某些情况下，皮革、骨头或Zurkhwood（见本章后面的\"{@area Fungi of the Underdark|067|x}\"）可以替代。手工制作可以包括修改拾取或打捞的物品以满足其他需要，比如用收集的盔甲和其他材料制作一套临时的盔甲。",
	"Spellcasters might be without material components for their spells (see \"{@book Components|PHB|10|Components}\" in chapter 10 of the {@i Player's Handbook}).

	"At the best of times, the Underdark is a bizarre, alien, and inhospitable world, but the influence of the demon lords has transformed it into a domain of madness and chaos. {@i Faerzress} acts as a catalyst, spreading the demon lords' madness throughout the Underdark.": "在最好的情况下，暗黑世界是一个奇异的、陌生的、荒凉的世界，但恶魔领主的影响已经把它变成了一个疯狂和混乱的领域。{@i Faerzress}作为一种催化剂，将恶魔领主的疯狂蔓延到整个暗黑世界。",

	"Bouts of short- and long-term madness can be cured as described in the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}. Given the demonic source of the madness, {@spell remove curse} and {@spell Dispel Evil and Good||dispel evil} are also effective as cures.

	"Allowing the chips to fall where they may in combat emphasizes the challenging nature of this adventure. However, if the characters start falling just as fast, you might want to give the players some opportunities to return dead characters to life during the lower levels of their progress through {@i Out of the Abyss.}": "在战斗中允许筹码落在他们可能的地方，强调了这个冒险的挑战性。然而，如果角色开始快速倒下，你可能想给玩家一些机会，让他们在低级别的进展过程中让死去的角色复活{@i Out of the Abyss.}",

An escaped slave from another Underdark settlement is another possibility.": "一个生物的遭遇可能会发现一个潜在的新党员，比如一个在暗黑世界迷路的地表居民，或者被派去调查奇怪事件的传闻。另一种可能是来自另一个地下城定居点的逃亡奴隶。",
	"A monster encountered by the party might be holding other victims or hostages (a giant spider with a still-living victim wrapped up in its web, or troglodytes holding prisoners destined for their larder, for example). Once the monsters are defeated, a former captive might join the group.": "当事人遇到的怪物可能还关押着其他受害者或人质（例如，一只巨大的蜘蛛将一个仍然活着的受害者包裹在它的网里，或者托克洛迪人关押着注定要送到他们的储藏室的囚犯）。一旦怪物被打败，以前的俘虏可能会加入队伍。",

	"First, the trek is long and arduous. The party is traveling underground, over incredibly difficult and rough terrain, without any of the comforts of the surface world. Food and water are scarce. The darkness never ends. The players should feel as though their characters are in peril throughout their travels, never knowing when something is set to leap at them from the shadows.": "首先，跋涉的过程是漫长而艰辛的。队伍在地下旅行，走的是极其困难和崎岖的地形，没有地面世界的任何舒适感。食物和水都很匮乏。黑暗永远不会结束。玩家应该感觉到他们的角色在整个旅行过程中处于危险之中，不知道什么时候会有东西从阴影中跳出来。",
	"Second, the Underdark is an exotic, alien landscape unlike anything found on the surface world. Throughout its twisted passageways and impossibly large caverns, characters might find bizarre reminders of lost and forgotten civilizations, unearthly flora and fauna, and incredible geography. Little is as it seems, and much is difficult to explain, or even to describe.": "第二，地下城是一个异国情调的，不同于表面世界的景观。在其扭曲的通道和不可能的大洞穴中，人物可能会发现失落和被遗忘的文明的奇异提醒，不食人间烟火的植物和动物，以及不可思议的地理环境。几乎没有什么是看起来那样的，很多东西都难以解释，甚至难以描述。",
	"A party of drow from Velkynvelve pursue their escaped prisoners into the Underdark. The drow priestess Ilvara becomes increasingly obsessed with the adventurers, believing they are involved in some secret conspiracy, or perhaps some test of her worthiness. The longer the pursuit, the more determined she is to retake them and have the opportunity to teach them the error of defying her.": "一队来自Velkynvelve的乌鸦人追捕他们逃跑的囚犯进入暗黑世界。鸦人女祭司伊尔瓦拉（Ilvara）对这些冒险者越来越痴迷，认为他们参与了一些秘密的阴谋，或许是对她的价值的测试。追捕的时间越长，她就越想夺回他们，并有机会让他们知道违抗她的错误。",

The hunting party also includes four {@creature drow} warriors who serve as forward scouts. If any of the drow NPCs did not survive chapter 1, replace them with newly arrived reinforcements from Menzoberranzan under the command of Ilvara, or another priestess of her caliber.": "鸦人队伍包括伊尔瓦拉（{@creature drow priestess of Lolth}）、{@creature Drow Elite Warrior||drow elite warriors}乔兰和肖尔，以及初级女祭司{@creature Asha Vandree|OotA}（使用{@i Monster Manual}中的{@creature priest}状态块，但要加上{@creature drow}状态块中的费伊祖先、先天法术和阳光敏感的特征）。狩猎队还包括四名{@creature drow}战士，他们充当前方的侦察兵。如果任何一个乌鸦NPC没有在第一章中存活下来，就用新到的增援部队代替他们，这些增援部队由伊尔瓦拉或她的另一个女祭司指挥。",
	"The drow must track the party through the Underdark on foot, as there are no mounts available at Velkynvelve and Ilvara doesn't wait for an already-late relief detachment from Menzoberranzan to arrive. This limits how quickly the dark elves can move to catch up, since they must seek out signs of their quarry's passage, occasionally doubling back to pick up their trail again.": "鸦人必须徒步在暗黑世界中追踪这支队伍，因为在维尔基维尔没有坐骑，而且伊尔瓦拉也没有等到已经很晚的来自门索贝兰赞的救援分队到达。这限制了黑暗精灵追赶的速度，因为他们必须寻找猎物通过的迹象，偶尔会折返回来再次追踪。",
	"The closeness of the drow pursuit is measured by a pursuit level. It begins at 4, with the drow not far behind the characters. If the pursuit level reaches 5, the drow forward scouts catch up to them, and the drow leaders arrive not long thereafter (see \"{@area Catching Up|07b|x}\"). If the pursuit level drops to 0, the party has eluded the drow until circumstances bring both factions into contact again (see \"{@area Eluding Pursuit|07c|x}\").": "乌鸦追击的密切程度由追击等级来衡量。它从4级开始，乌鸦在人物后面不远处。如果追击等级达到5，乌鸦的前哨侦察兵就会追上他们，而乌鸦首领也会在不久之后到达（见\"{@area Catching Up|07b|x}\"）。如果追击水平下降到0，那么这支队伍就躲过了乌鸦的追击，直到环境使两派再次接触（见\"{@area Eluding Pursuit|07c|x}\"）。",

	"Decrease the pursuit level by 1 each time the characters cross or traverse some feature that obscures their trail, such as a subterranean river.": "每次人物穿过或穿越一些掩盖其踪迹的特征时，如地下河，追击等级就会降低1。",
	"Decrease the pursuit level by 1 if the party splits into two or more groups. Each group becomes a separate party for purposes of determining random encounters and whether or not the group becomes lost.": "如果队伍分成两组或更多组，追击等级减少1。在确定随机遭遇和是否迷路时，每组都成为一个单独的队伍。",
	"Increase the pursuit level by 1 each time the party has a random encounter with one or more creatures, unless the encounter is bypassed or avoided entirely.": "每次聚会与一个或多个生物发生随机遭遇时，追击等级增加1，除非该遭遇被绕过或完全避开。",

	"Certain terrain encounters increase or decrease the pursuit level. See the individual descriptions in the \"Random Encounters\" section.": "某些地形的遭遇会增加或减少追击水平。见 \"随机遭遇 \"部分的个别描述。",
	"The players might come up with additional ways of evading pursuit. Adjudicate these as you see fit. For example, if the characters convince a randomly encountered creature to let them pass by telling them about the wealthy drow following them, you might reduce the pursuit level by 1 as the drow are forced to deal with the encounter before they can resume tracking the party. Similarly, the adventurers could lay traps to slow down their pursuers, or they might convince a friendly creature to lie to the drow about which way the party went.": "队员们可能会想出更多的方法来逃避追捕。按照你认为合适的方式进行裁决。例如，如果角色们说服一个随机遇到的生物让他们通过，告诉他们有一个富有的乌鸦在跟踪他们，你可以将追捕等级降低1，因为乌鸦被迫在继续跟踪队伍之前处理好这次遭遇。同样地，冒险者们可以布置陷阱来减缓追捕者的速度，或者他们可以说服一个友好的生物向乌鸦撒谎，告诉他们队伍走了哪条路。",
	"If you choose to skip over a few days of travel (as described under \"{@area Summarizing Travel|0ac|x}\" later in this chapter), the pursuit level doesn't change during that time.": "如果你选择跳过几天的旅行（如本章后面的\"{@area Summarizing Travel|0ac|x} \"中所述），在这段时间里，追求水平不会改变。",
	"When the pursuit level reaches 5, the drow forward scouts spot the party. At this point, the pursuit might become an encounter if the characters spot the drow and engage them. The characters might try to run, at which point a chase ensues (see \"{@book Chases|DMG|8|Chases}\" in chapter 8 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}), or they might stand and fight. They might even try to set up some sort of ambush, since the front ranks of the party are likely out of sight of the drow when they first catch up.": "当追击等级达到5级时，乌鸦的前哨侦察兵发现了这支队伍。这时，如果角色们发现了乌鸦并与之交战，追击就可能变成一场遭遇战。角色们可能会试图逃跑，这时就会发生追逐（见《(1%)》第8章的\"{@book Chases|DMG|8|Chases}\"），或者他们可能会站起来战斗。他们甚至可以尝试设下某种埋伏，因为当他们第一次追上乌鸦时，队伍的前排很可能已经离开了他们的视线。",
	"If the adventurers flee and successfully escape, they lower the pursuit level to 4 and begin avoiding their pursuers again. If they fight the drow, run the encounter. The drow scouts focus on maintaining close pursuit and peppering the characters with poisoned hand crossbow bolts. After {@dice 1d6 + 4} rounds, the remainder of the drow party (Ilvara, Asha, Jorlan, and Shoor) catches up and joins the encounter.": "如果冒险者逃跑并成功逃脱，他们会将追击等级降低到4级，并再次开始躲避追兵。如果他们与乌鸦战斗，则进行遭遇战。乌鸦人的侦察兵专注于保持近距离追击，并用带毒的手弩箭攻击角色。在{@dice 1d6 + 4}回合之后，乌鸦队伍的其余成员（伊尔瓦拉、阿莎、乔兰和肖尔）追了上来，加入了这场遭遇战。",
	"If the adventurers lower the pursuit level to 0, the drow lose the trail unless circumstances allow them to locate the characters again. This might include the characters spending a day or more in a place where they are recognized, or where they talk openly about their escape from Velkynvelve. If the characters pass through an area watched over by drow scouts or spies, Ilvara will inevitably hear word of the characters' location. When this occurs, increase the pursuit level to 1 and begin tracking it again as the drow pick up the trail once more.": "如果冒险者将追捕等级降至0，那么乌鸦就会失去踪迹，除非情况允许他们再次找到这些人物。这可能包括人物在一个他们被认出的地方呆上一天或更久，或者他们在那里公开谈论他们从Velkynvelve逃出来的事情。如果这些角色经过了一个由鸦人侦察员或间谍监视的区域，伊尔瓦拉将不可避免地听到这些角色位置的消息。当这种情况发生时，将追捕级别提高到1，并在乌鸦再次拾起线索时再次开始追踪。",
	"If an encounter with the drow is going badly and you don't want the characters recaptured, you can always have fate intercede on their behalf with another encounter or event offering a distraction.": "如果与乌鸦的遭遇很糟糕，而你又不想让角色被抓回来，你可以让命运替他们出面，用另一个遭遇或事件来转移他们的注意力。",
	"For example, a wandering stone giant, a purple worm, or a pack of savage gnolls whipped into a frenzy by Yeenoghu might show up just as the drow have the characters cornered, giving them a chance to run. Likewise, a minor earthquake (caused by instability from the demonic incursion or a wild magic surge) might cause a cave-in, cutting off a tunnel between the party and their pursuers, and dropping the pursuit level by 1 or 2.": "例如，一个游荡的石巨人、一只紫色的虫子，或者一群被耶诺古激怒的野蛮地精，可能会在乌鸦把角色逼到角落时出现，给他们一个逃跑的机会。同样地，一场小地震（由恶魔入侵的不稳定性或狂野的魔法涌动引起）可能会导致洞穴坍塌，切断队伍与追兵之间的通道，并使追击等级下降1或2。",
	"Don't do this so often that the players feel they haven't earned it, but use it as an option to keep the pursuit going rather than coming to an anticlimactic conclusion.": "不要经常这样做，以至于玩家觉得他们没有赚到钱，但要把它作为一个选项，让追击的过程继续下去，而不是以一种反常的方式结束。",
	"Each day of travel through the Underdark, check twice to see if the characters encounter anything unusual: once while they are traveling, and again while they are camped or resting. Roll a {@dice d20} and consult the Random Encounters table to determine what, if anything, they encounter.

	"In the middle of the room rests a wide stone sarcophagus atop a black marble bier. The lid of the sarcophagus is inlaid with dust-covered mosaics depicting great floating cities high above a beautiful landscape. The lid of the sarcophagus looks incredibly heavy but is made lighter by an ancient spell that has survived to this day. The lid can be pushed aside with a successful DC 10 Strength check. The sarcophagus contains a life-sized statue of Brysis, sculpted and painted to make it appear that she is sleeping comfortably. The statue is affixed to the inside of the sarcophagus with {@item sovereign glue} and can't be moved. There is no treasure to be found.": "在房间的中央，有一具宽大的石棺，放在一个黑色大理石的棺材上。石棺的盖子上镶嵌着布满灰尘的马赛克，描绘着高悬在美丽风景之上的巨大浮动城市。石棺的盖子看起来非常重，但通过一个古老的咒语使其变轻，这个咒语一直流传到今天。只要成功地进行DC10力量检查，就可以把盖子推到一边。石棺里有一尊布赖斯的真人大小的雕像，经过雕刻和绘画，使她看起来像是在舒适地睡觉。雕像被固定在石棺的内部，无法被移动。没有宝物可寻。",
	"Opening the sarcophagus triggers a {@spell magic mouth} spell that calls out in a booming voice, \"You have disturbed the tomb of Brysis of Khaem! Accursed are you, most miserable of creatures!\" Each creature in the room, whether it hears the booming voice or not, must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature is cursed with disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws. The creature can repeat the saving throw after 24 hours have elapsed, ending the effect on itself with a successful save. Otherwise, a {@spell remove curse} spell ends this effect, as does destroying the wraith in area 5.": "打开石棺会触发一个{@spell magic mouth}的咒语，这个咒语会以洪亮的声音呼唤：\"你们扰乱了凯姆的布莱斯的坟墓！你们被诅咒了！\"。你是被诅咒的，最悲惨的生物！\" 房间里的每一个生物，不管它是否听到了那洪亮的声音，都必须做一个DC15的魅力拯救动作。如果失败，该生物会被诅咒，在攻击卷和蓄力投掷中处于劣势。该生物可以在24小时后重复该蓄力动作，如果蓄力成功则结束对自己的影响。否则，一个(1%)的法术会结束这个效果，就像在第5区摧毁包裹一样。",

	"Though its name might evoke images of a single subterranean body of water, the Darklake is a network of underground rivers, natural tunnels, and canals that connect innumerable water-filled caverns and chambers. This vast waterway stretches over a hundred miles across, with ceilings that are miles high in some places and depths that are unfathomable.": "虽然它的名字可能会让人联想到一个单一的地下水体，但黑暗湖是一个由地下河、天然隧道和运河组成的网络，连接着无数充满水的洞穴和房间。这条巨大的水道横跨一百多英里，有些地方的天花板有几英里高，深度则深不可测。",
	"Long ago, duergar engineers extended and widened many of the interconnecting passages of the Darklake. They also constructed locks for raising and lowering watercraft to different levels within it, opening up large portions of the network for travel. Many Underdark creatures are experienced in navigating the Darklake, including the kuo-toa—fishlike humanoids known for their insane obsession with unraveling the secret patterns of the Underdark. Still, better to trust a kuo-toa guide than attempt to traverse the Darklake alone and become lost within it forever.": "很久以前，duergar工程师扩展并拓宽了黑暗湖的许多相互连接的通道。他们还建造了锁，用于将水车提升和降低到不同的楼层，为旅行开放了大量的网络。许多暗黑世界的生物都有驾驭黑暗湖的经验，包括以疯狂迷恋解开暗黑世界的秘密模式而闻名的Kuo-toa-鱼状人。尽管如此，相信Kuo-toa的向导比试图独自穿越黑暗之湖并永远迷失在其中要好。",
	"The adventurers can use the Darklake to reach many destinations in the Underdark. More importantly, water travel makes it difficult for their drow pursuers to track them. The kuo-toa town of Sloobludop is located on the eastern edge of the Darklake, and is a potential source of watercraft and navigational aid. But as they seek out these resources, the characters learn of terrible powers loose in the Underdark—worse than the drow, the kuo-toa, or any other threat of this dark realm.": "冒险家们可以利用黑暗之湖到达暗黑世界的许多目的地。更重要的是，水上旅行使追捕他们的乌鸦人难以追踪他们。Sloobludop的Kuo-toa镇位于黑暗湖的东部边缘，是一个潜在的水上交通工具和导航工具的来源。但当他们寻找这些资源时，角色们了解到暗黑世界的可怕力量--比乌鸦、Kuo-toa或这个黑暗领域的任何其他威胁都更可怕。",
	"The adventurers need to find a way to cross the Darklake on the way to their ultimate destination—out of the Underdark and back to the surface world. They might attempt to find a guide or hire passage in Sloobludop, but other possibilities could also present themselves.": "冒险家们需要在前往最终目的地的路上找到穿越黑暗之湖的方法，离开地下世界，回到地面世界。他们可能会试图在斯洛布洛普找到一个向导或租用通道，但也可能出现其他的可能性。",
	"The adventurers might find different ways to cross the Darklake, depending on how long they traverse it and who or what they encounter along the way.": "冒险家们可能会找到不同的方法来穿越黑暗湖，这取决于他们穿越黑暗湖的时间以及沿途遇到的人或事。",
	"Since there is no wind in the Underdark, all water travel involves either rowing at 1½ miles per hour, or floating with prevailing currents at 1 mile per hour. Characters can work in shifts to row more than 8 hours per day, but crewing a boat for longer than that is considered a forced march (see {@book chapter 8|PHB|8|Travel Pace} of the {@i Player's Handbook}).": "由于暗黑世界没有风，所有的水上旅行都是以每小时1.5英里的速度划船，或者以每小时1英里的速度随水流漂浮。角色可以轮流工作，每天划船超过8小时，但划船时间超过8小时则被视为强制行军（见{@i Player's Handbook}的{@book chapter 8|PHB|8|Travel Pace}）。",
	"Most craft navigating the waters of the Darklake are zurkhwood vessels piloted by the kuo-tua or the duergar.

	"Characters can also construct makeshift rafts using materials at hand. For example, the cap of a giant zurkhwood mushroom can be hollowed out to make a coracle equivalent to a rowboat, but with half a rowboat's hit points (see the {@table Owning a Ship; Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles||Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles} table in chapter 5 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}). This is a downtime crafting activity requiring one day's work per raft.": "角色也可以用手边的材料建造临时的木筏。例如，可以将一个巨大的紫檀木蘑菇的盖子挖空，做成一个相当于划艇的木箱，但命中率只有划艇的一半（见{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}第五章中的{@table Owning a Ship; Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles||Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles}表）。这是一项停工期的制作活动，每个木筏需要一天的工作时间。",
	"An even more makeshift craft might involve a character sitting in a floating barrel or other watertight container, either steering with a paddle or flowing with the current. Such a vessel has a speed of 1 mph, requires a crew of 1, allows for no passengers or cargo, and has AC 11, hp 20, and damage threshold 0.": "一个更临时的船可能涉及到一个角色坐在一个漂浮的桶或其他水密的容器中，用桨来操纵或随波逐流。这种船的速度为每小时1英里，需要1名船员，不允许有任何乘客或货物，AC为11，HP为20，伤害阈值为0。",

	"The Darklake is a giant labyrinth of lakes, waterways, and canals that connect myriad caverns and chambers. Some of these caverns are massive, with immeasurably deep water and vaulted ceilings far outside the range of any light. Others are narrow, with only a few feet of space between the ceiling and the surface of the water. Some are completely submerged, navigable only by those able to breathe underwater.": "黑暗湖是由湖泊、水路和运河组成的巨大迷宫，连接着无数的洞穴和房间。其中一些洞穴非常巨大，水深不可估量，拱形的天花板远远超出任何光线的范围。另一些则很狭窄，天花板和水面之间只有几英尺的空间。有些则完全被淹没，只有能够在水下呼吸的人才能航行。",

	"The characters need supplies and equipment, and hope the kuo-toa might be willing to trade for whatever they can offer. Alternatively, the characters might try to steal what they need from the kuo-toa.": "这些人物需要物资和设备，并希望Kuo-toa愿意用他们能提供的东西进行交易。或者，这些人物可以尝试从国土人那里偷取他们需要的东西。",
	"Shuushar might point out any of the previous reasons, or wish to go to Sloobludop to rejoin his people, feeling he has important guidance to offer them.": "舒沙可能会指出之前的任何一个原因，或者希望去斯洛布洛德普重新加入他的人民，觉得他有重要的指导意义可以提供给他们。",

Thus, much of what they do on land is a bizarre approximation of life under the water.": "虽然Kuo-toa人很疯狂，但至少有一部分疯狂来自于完全陌生的思维模式。虽然是两栖的空中居民，但Kuo-toa人在很大程度上仍然表现为水生生物。因此，他们在陆地上所做的大部分事情都是对水底生活的一种奇怪的近似。",
	"Kuo-toa names are a long series of gargling syllables, and their voices have a bubbly, gargling quality. However, the kuo-toa communicate as much through gesture as speech. They have difficulty standing still, and are prone to quick, darting movements. They pace constantly, walking in circles around creatures talking to them. A kuo-toa priest speaking to a group of followers doesn't stand at a podium but wanders aimlessly while the crowd follows like a school of fish.": "Kuo-toa的名字是一长串漱口的音节，他们的声音也有一种气泡般的漱口质量。然而，Kuo-toa人通过手势和语言进行交流。他们很难站稳，很容易出现快速、飞快的动作。他们不断地踱步，围绕着与他们交谈的生物转圈。一个对一群追随者讲话的Kuo-toa牧师并不站在讲台上，而是漫无目的地游走，而人群则像鱼群一样跟着。",
	"Kuo-toa prefer their leaders to be physically above their subordinates. (If no dais or platform is available for leaders, they have been known to literally stand on top of prostrate underlings.) However, leaders tend to dwell on the lowest levels of buildings because these are considered the safest areas in a settlement, due to their proximity to the water.": "Kuo-toa喜欢他们的领导人在身体上高于他们的下属。(如果没有台子或平台供领导人使用，他们就会站在匍匐在地的下属之上。） 然而，领导人倾向于居住在建筑物的最低层，因为这些地方被认为是定居点中最安全的地方，因为它们靠近水。",
	"Since the kuo-toa are fishlike, they lack eyelids. This isn't only unnerving in conversation (a kuo-toa never blinks), but it also means that kuo-toa all look the same sleeping as awake—and virtually all kuo-toa sleepwalk, making things even more confusing. There is a 25 percent chance that any individual kuo-toa the party encounters in Sloobludop is sleepwalking, ignoring everyone around it and moving in a shuffling gait from place to place.": "由于Kuo-toa像鱼一样，它们没有眼睑。这不仅在对话中令人不安（Kuo-toa从不眨眼），而且还意味着Kuo-toa在睡觉时和清醒时看起来都一样，而且几乎所有的Kuo-toa都会梦游，这使事情变得更加混乱。在Sloobludop遇到的任何单个的Kuo-toa都有25%的机会是在梦游，无视周围的人，以洗牌的步态从一个地方走到另一个地方。",
	"If Shuushar accompanies the party, the kuo-toa monk can be helpful in communicating with his people at Sloobludop. However, keep in mind that Shuushar is either a heretic or a holy man depending on which kuo-toa he's speaking to, and how they view things at that particular moment. The mysterious monk could serve as an ace in the hole to help the party out, or he could just as easily cause trouble with his stubborn refusal to acknowledge his fellow kuo-toa's religious obsessions as anything other than \"dangerous illusions,\" combined with his preference for nonviolent solutions.": "如果舒沙与队伍同行，这个国土僧侣可以帮助他与斯洛布洛普的人进行沟通。然而，请记住，舒沙要么是个异教徒，要么是个圣人，这取决于他与哪个国土人交谈，以及他们在那个特定时刻如何看待事物。这个神秘的和尚可以作为一张王牌来帮助党，或者他也可以很容易地造成麻烦，因为他顽固地拒绝承认他的国土伙伴的宗教痴迷是 \"危险的幻想 \"以外的东西，再加上他对非暴力解决方案的偏好。",

	"Ploopploopeen explains that the inhabitants of Sloobludop have lived in harmonious service to the will of the Sea Mother for some time. Oh, there were occasional \"visionaries\" who stirred up trouble (at this, he might cast a walleyed glance at Shuushar) but nothing of any great concern. A few weeks ago, Bloppblippodd, Ploopploopeen's own daughter, experienced a powerful vision of \"Leemooggoogoon the Deep Father,\" proclaiming him the new god of her people. She has backed up her claims with a great increase in her magical power, and new followers have flocked to her.": "Ploopploopeen解释说，Sloobludop的居民已经在和谐地服务于海母的意志中生活了一段时间。哦，偶尔会有一些 \"异想天开者 \"挑起事端（说到这里，他可能会向舒沙投去一抹鄙夷的目光），但没有什么大问题。几周前，普罗普洛佩恩的女儿布洛普利波德（Bloppblippodd）经历了 \"深海之父利莫古恩 \"的强大异象，宣布他是她人民的新神。她用她的魔法力量的巨大增长来支持她的说法，新的追随者已经蜂拥而至。",
	"\"We are split in two,\" Ploopploopeen explains, \"fighting among ourselves.\" The followers of the Deep Father have been making an increasing number of offerings on his altar—killing blood sacrifices then casting bloody chum into the waters of the Darklake, where it is consumed by... something.": "\"我们一分为二，\"Ploopploopeen解释说，\"我们之间在战斗。\" 深海之父的追随者已经在他的祭坛上做了越来越多的祭品--杀戮的血祭，然后将血腥的口水投进黑暗湖的水域，在那里被......什么东西吃掉。",
	"The archpriest of the Sea Mother tells the characters he wants to use them as bait. The archpriest of the Deep Father needs humanoid sacrifices, and the party represents a prize collection in that regard. Ploopploopeen will offer the characters as a \"token of peace and reconciliation\" to get closer to the archpriest of the Deep Father—except the adventurers will not be helpless prisoners, but infiltrators. Ploopploopeen wants the characters to disrupt the upstart faction's rituals, allowing his true believers of the Sea Mother to cut off the head of the cult. The archpriest promises that the characters will be \"well rewarded\" for their aid.": "海之母的大神官告诉这些人物，他想用他们作为诱饵。深海之父的大神官需要人形的祭品，而这一行人在这方面代表了一个奖品的收集。Ploopploopeen将把这些角色作为 \"和平与和解的信物\"，以接近深海之父的大祭司--只不过冒险者们将不是无助的囚犯，而是渗透者。Ploopploopeen希望角色们能破坏新晋派别的仪式，让他的海之母的真正信徒砍掉邪教的头。大祭司承诺，这些人物将因为他们的帮助而得到 \"丰厚的回报\"。",
	"If the characters refuse, Ploopploopeen tries to turn them over anyway, still using them as bait to get his own kuo-toa loyalists closer to his daughter's cult. However, he no longer depends on or supports the characters as allies, leaving them to survive on their own.": "如果这些人物拒绝，Ploopploopeen还是会试图把他们交出来，仍然以他们为诱饵，让自己的Kuo-toa忠诚者接近他女儿的邪教。然而，他不再依赖或支持这些人物作为盟友，让他们自己生存。",
	"No matter whether the characters approach the final encounter as willing participants or prisoners, the kuo-toa make no effort to bind them or take their weapons, believing in the power of their superior numbers and the divine might of their competing gods.": "无论人物是作为自愿的参与者还是俘虏接近最后的遭遇，国土人都不会努力束缚他们或夺取他们的武器，他们相信自己人数众多的力量和他们竞争的神的神力。",
	"The kuo-toa are aquatic creatures. As such, they have no real need for the boats they use to ply the Darklake, even as boating remains a significant part of their culture.": "kuo-toa人是水生动物。因此，他们并不真正需要用来在暗湖上航行的船只，尽管划船仍然是他们文化的一个重要组成部分。",
	"It might well be that the kuo-toa's former masters—the mind flayers—used them as ferry pilots and navigators in the Underdark, and the fish-folk continue to do so out of habit or some deep-seated need. Certainly, their relative usefulness to the other races of the Underdark has served the kuo-toa well. Only the duergar have shown any interest in navigating the waters of the Darklake on their own, and not even they do it as well as the kuo-toa.": "很可能是Kuo-toa以前的主人--心灵传播者--把它们作为暗黑世界的渡轮驾驶员和导航员，而鱼人继续这样做是出于习惯或某种根深蒂固的需要。当然，他们对暗黑世界其他种族的相对有用性对Kuo-toa很有帮助。只有杜尔加人对自己在暗黑湖的水域中航行表现出任何兴趣，甚至他们也没有像国土人那样做得好。",
	"There is a persistent myth among the inhabitants of Sloobludop that the maze of tunnels, passages, and pools of the Darklake is a kind of meditation—a spiritual journey. Kuo-toa who navigate that maze long enough will awaken to a great revelation for their people. As with many of the strange beliefs of the kuo-toa, this one might only need time to become a reality.": "在Sloobludop的居民中，有一个持续的神话，即黑暗湖的隧道、通道和水池的迷宫是一种冥想--精神之旅。库奥图瓦人如果在迷宫中航行足够长的时间，就会觉醒，为他们的人民带来巨大的启示。与Kuo-toa人的许多奇怪信仰一样，这个信仰可能只需要时间就能成为现实。",
	"Sloobludop is enclosed to the north and south by outer \"walls\" of heavy netting with sharp bone hooks woven into them.

	"A nine-foot-tall statue stands here. Its body is roughly carved from some kind of wood in the shape of a humanoid female, its head and forearms formed from the severed head and claws of a giant albino crayfish. These parts are lashed on with strands of gut, and emit an overpowering stench of rotting shellfish. Shells, brightly colored stones, mushrooms, and rotting fish are piled at the statue's feet and strung in garlands around its neck. Four stern kuo-toa slowly circle the statue, alert and on guard, while a few others mill about, gazing up at the statue and bowing repeatedly while chanting.": "一座九英尺高的雕像矗立在这里。它的身体由某种木头粗略地雕刻成一个人形女性的形状，它的头部和前臂由一只巨大的白化小龙虾的头和爪子形成。这些部分是用一缕缕的内脏鞭打上去的，并散发着一股强烈的腐烂贝类的臭味。贝壳、色彩鲜艳的石头、蘑菇和腐烂的鱼都堆在雕像的脚下，并在它的脖子上串成花环。四个严厉的国土人缓缓地围着雕像转圈，保持着警惕和戒备，而其他几个人则在旁边转悠，仰望着雕像，一边念叨一边反复鞠躬。",

	"If allowed to do so, Ploopploopeen brings the characters to his quarters near the Shrine of the Deep Mother. There they meet Glooglugogg, who loudly tells his father in Undercommon that he sees no need for outsiders to be involved in sacred matters.

The whip relents but throws the characters a hostile glare.": "如果被允许，Ploopploopeen会把这些人物带到他在深海之母神殿附近的住所。在那里他们遇到了Glooglugogg，他大声地告诉他的父亲，他认为没有必要让外人参与到神圣的事务中。大祭司用疏忽的挥手打消了儿子的顾虑，告诉Glooglugogg，他必须顺着女神的幻象的潮流前进。鞭子松了口气，但向这些人物投去了敌意的目光。",
	"Within the hour, twelve {@creature kuo-toa} led by a {@creature kuo-toa monitor} arrive at Ploopploopeen's quarters.

May their blood nourish and strengthen him!\" A burbling cheer goes up from the surrounding kuo-toa, their fists raised in the air.": "海神母的大祭司穿过祭坛的跨度，走向在那里等待他的Kuo-toa。\"时间到了，\"他说，\"我们要承认你的神圣愿景并欢迎它。我带来了这些作为祭品。\" 他向你们所有人做了个手势，站在他身后的一圈卫兵中。\"你们不接受它们吗？\" \"你是明智的，父亲，\"年轻的大主教回答说。\"我以深渊之父的名义接受你的奉献。愿他们的血能滋养和加强他！\" 周围的Kuo-toa发出一阵阵欢呼声，他们的拳头举在空中。",
	"The followers of the Deep Father are already preparing to sacrifice a bruised and bedraggled {@creature duergar} named Hemeth—an arms smuggler who was looking to cut a deal with one or both factions of the kuo-toa, but instead found himself captured for his trouble.

	"When the sacrifices are brought forward, Bloppblippodd gestures toward the altar, whereupon her father suddenly attacks, striking her with his scepter.

Then two monstrous heads break the surface, both resembling hideous, angry baboons with wickedly curved tusks. Both heads are attached to a single torso, and the monster's red eyes burn with bloodlust and madness. The creature rising from the Darklake must stand thirty feet tall or more, with water cascading down its back and shoulders. Upon reaching its full height, the great demon throws back both its heads and roars!": "另一种声音在Kuo-toa的咕咕叫声中升起。漆黑的水面远处冒出了气泡，开始泛起泡沫。一条粗大、油腻的触手迸发出来，接着是另一条。然后，两个怪异的头打破了水面，都像狰狞的、愤怒的狒狒，长着邪恶的弯曲的獠牙。两个头都连在一个躯干上，怪物的红色眼睛燃烧着嗜血和疯狂。从黑暗湖中升起的生物必须站在30英尺高或更高的地方，水从它的背部和肩部流下。在达到它的全部高度时，这个伟大的恶魔向后抛出它的两个头，并咆哮着",
	"Hopefully, the players exercise the better part of valor and flee as soon as they see the demon lord. If they confront him, they are almost certainly doomed. Fortunately for them, Demogorgon is focused on smashing the kuo-toa settlement and pays little heed to the puny creatures fleeing from him. The characters thus have a good chance of getting away if they act quickly. They might first need to deal with companions overcome by bouts of madness, however, and they need to decide how they intend to escape.": "希望玩家们能发挥出更好的勇气，一看到恶魔领主就马上逃走。如果他们与他对峙，他们几乎肯定会完蛋。幸运的是，Demogorgon正专注于捣毁Kuo-toa定居点，对那些从他身边逃开的弱小生物并不关心。因此，如果他们行动迅速，就有很大的机会逃脱。然而，他们可能首先需要对付那些被疯狂情绪所笼罩的同伴，而且他们需要决定他们打算如何逃跑。",

	"Despite its dangers, Gracklstugh does have a few things to offer... or at least that's what some of the characters' fellow escapees tell them.": "尽管有危险，Gracklstugh确实有一些东西可以提供......或者至少这是一些人物的同伴告诉他们的逃跑。",
	"{@creature Buppido|OotA} (see {@area chapter 1|008|x}) and Hemeth (see {@area chapter 3|12a|x}) are the only NPCs who actively suggest going to Gracklstugh. They know that duergar have no love for the drow, and their draconian laws keep all foreigners in check, which should provide some measure of sanctuary from drow pursuit. Gracklstugh is as good a place as any in the Underdark to sell stolen gear and buy more useful equipment. Additionally, the duergar trade actively with other subterranean and surface-dwelling races. Gracklstugh's Blade Bazaar might be the ideal place to find traders or explorers heading to the surface world.": "{@creature Buppido|OotA}（见{@area chapter 1|008|x}）和Hemeth（见{@area chapter 3|12a|x}）是唯一积极建议去Gracklstugh的NPC。他们知道杜尔加人对乌鸦没有好感，他们的严酷法律控制着所有的外国人，这应该能提供某种程度的避难所，让他们免受乌鸦的追捕。Gracklstugh是暗黑世界中最适合出售偷来的装备和购买更多有用装备的地方。此外，杜尔加人还积极地与其他地下和地面居住的种族进行贸易。格拉克斯图的刀锋集市可能是寻找前往地表世界的商人或探险家的理想场所。",
	"If {@creature Buppido|OotA} or Hemeth isn't with the party, others can provide the above information. Sarith resists plans to travel to the city at first, conscious of the low regard the duergar have for drow. He changes his mind quickly, however, as Zuggtmoy's spores drive him to seek a densely populated area where he can spread his contagion.": "如果{@creature Buppido|OotA}或Hemeth不在队伍中，其他人可以提供上述信息。Sarith起初抵制前往城市的计划，因为他意识到杜尔加人对乌鸦的轻视。然而，他很快就改变了主意，因为祖格莫伊的孢子促使他寻找一个人口稠密的地区，在那里他可以传播他的传染病。",
	"It's also possible the party arrives at Gracklstugh involuntarily. Duergar slavers scour the Underdark in search of new \"merchandise,\" and they might deceive or outright capture the characters and bring them to their city's slave markets. The random encounters in chapters 2 and 3 can easily set up this scenario.": "他们也有可能不由自主地来到了格拉克尔斯图。Duergar奴隶主在暗黑世界中寻找新的 \"商品\"，他们可能会欺骗或直接捕获角色，并将他们带到他们城市的奴隶市场。第2章和第3章中的随机遭遇可以很容易地设置这个场景。",
	"Taking refuge in Gracklstugh has its advantages. Each day they spend in the duergar capital, the characters can attempt a DC 16 group Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check to move around cautiously, with success indicating that they avoid drawing attention to themselves. The characters can also attempt a DC 13 group Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check to assess the mood in the city, with success allowing them to avoid trouble before it starts.

	"The party's fellow escapees know that trying to enter through the main entrances is a sure way to get enslaved, unless one of the characters is an epic liar who can convince the guards the party is a legitimate diplomatic or trade delegation. Anyone with a merchant or criminal background has heard rumors that the Zhentarim trade in the Underdark, but posing as Zhentarim has its own risks, as such claims are bound to be questioned. A character who is actually a member of the Zhentarim can buy the adventurers a couple of days inside the city before the duergar slavers start taking their measure.": "队伍的同伴们知道，试图从主要入口进入肯定会被奴役，除非其中一个角色是个史诗般的骗子，能让守卫相信队伍是一个合法的外交或贸易代表团。任何有商人或犯罪背景的人都听说过赞塔林在暗黑世界进行贸易的传闻，但冒充赞塔林也有其风险，因为这种说法必然会受到质疑。一个真正是赞塔林成员的角色可以为冒险者争取到几天的时间，在杜尔加奴隶主开始打量他们之前，他们可以在城内停留几天。",
	"Arriving by way of the Darklake Docks is easier and more discreet. If the characters are traveling by boat, {@creature Buppido|OotA} can guide them to a deserted pier where they can dock quietly. He warns them that they have to keep a low profile and head directly to the only inn in the city devoted to outsiders. The Ghohlbrorn's Lair is frequented by merchants, mercenaries, and other foreigners who can offer information about traveling elsewhere in the Underdark—or perhaps even to the surface world.": "通过暗湖码头到达更容易，也更隐蔽。如果人物是乘船旅行，{@creature Buppido|OotA}可以引导他们到一个废弃的码头，在那里他们可以安静地停靠。他警告他们必须保持低调，并直接前往城市中唯一专门为外来者服务的旅馆。Ghohlbrorn's Lair是商人、雇佣兵和其他外国人经常光顾的地方，他们可以提供有关在暗黑世界其他地方旅行的信息，甚至可能是到地面世界的信息。",
	"Sweltering heat and cloying smoke cling to every corner of the duergar city, spewing from smelters housed inside massive stalagmites and stalactites. These protrude from the cavern's floor and ceiling like the teeth of some great maw.": "闷热的天气和令人窒息的烟雾笼罩着杜尔加城市的每一个角落，从装在巨大的石笋和钟乳石里的冶炼厂喷出。这些石笋和钟乳石从洞穴的地板和天花板上伸出来，就像一些大嘴的牙齿。",
	"Gracklstugh's glowing forges and smithies operate continuously. Most of the city is dimly lit by a hellish red glow, with patches of darkness here and there.": "Gracklstugh的发光锻造厂和铁匠铺持续运作。城市的大部分地区都被地狱般的红光照亮，这里和那里都有一些黑暗的斑点。",

The duergar consider art a frivolous pursuit, and only rarely appreciate or create it.": "灰矮人重视效率、坚忍和努力工作，这些价值观在他们的资本中得到了体现。灰矮人制造或建造的所有东西都有其目的和功能；他们在建筑方面唯一重视的美学就是宏伟的规模，即使这也是次要的，因为建筑的结构功能。在Gracklstugh发现的唯一的装饰品是二重奏社会中等级和功能的标志性代表，唯一的音乐是锻造厂里无休止的有节奏的敲击声。duergar人认为艺术是一种轻浮的追求，而且很少欣赏或创造它。",
	"The lairds and merchants who sit at this council make sure that trade and commerce flow smoothly. They employ slave labor to maintain trade routes in the dangerous Underdark, and are always open to hiring explorers to check out leads on potential new routes. Expendable outsiders hired as caravan guards always take point and receive little aid or support from the caravan masters. Despite these unfair assignments, the duergar always live up to their bargains, paying survivors as promised.": "坐在议会里的领主和商人们确保贸易和商业的顺利进行。他们雇佣奴隶来维护危险的暗黑世界的贸易路线，并且总是愿意雇佣探险家来检查潜在的新路线的线索。被雇为商队守卫的消耗品的外来者总是拿着点，很少得到商队主人的援助或支持。尽管有这些不公平的任务，杜尔加人总是履行他们的协议，按照承诺支付幸存者。",

The DC for each check is 10 + the creature's current {@condition exhaustion} level.": "一个被格拉克龙带来的{@condition exhaustion}等级的生物必须在宪法检查中成功，才能采取{@action Dash}的行动。如果检定失败，则不能尝试该行动。如果该生物试图施放一个有语言成分的咒语，它必须在体质检查中成功，否则无法完成咒语，导致咒语失败，没有效果。每次检定的DC是10+该生物当前的{@condition exhaustion}等级。",
	"The stone giants of Clan Cairngorm lead quiet lives of art and contemplation in Gracklstugh. Although reclusive and averse to conflict, the giants have sworn an ancient oath of loyalty to the Deepking, and have been serving his line for as long as any can remember.

	"The leader of the stone giants is Stonespeaker Hgraam, a priest of Skoraeus Stonebones, the god of his people. Hgraam is wise and knowledgeable.

	"The Wyrmsmith is beginning to chafe under the Keepers' control. He now wonders why he is content with a mere trickle of gold and a paltry handful of slaves, when he could simply force the entire city to bend knee to him and give him everything he desires. For now, his actions are limited by how little he cares about the duergar and how much the Keepers speak \"on his behalf.\" But he has begun taking an interest in the affairs of Gracklstugh and the opportunity to recruit new servants from outside the Keepers of the Flame, using his outings to rekindle forges and smelters as a means to keep an eye out for promising subjects.": "在守护者的控制下，巫师开始感到不安。他现在想知道为什么他只满足于涓涓细流的黄金和一小撮奴隶，而他可以简单地迫使整个城市向他屈膝，给他想要的一切。目前，他的行动受到了限制，因为他对杜尔加的关心程度很低，而且守卫者们 \"代表他 \"说话。但他已经开始对格拉克尔斯图的事务和从火焰守护者之外招募新仆人的机会感兴趣，利用他外出重燃锻造厂和冶炼厂的机会，留意有前途的对象。",

	"The {@i Forak-Erach-Naek} (\"Empty-Scabbard Killers\" in Common) are a folktale in Gracklstugh, their name derived from an ancient, obscure Dwarvish dialect.

More than a myth, these killers have been plying their trade for centuries, their motives unknown and their methods inscrutable.": "{@i Forak-Erach-Naek} (\"Empty-Scabbard Killers\" in Common)是Gracklstugh的一个民间故事，他们的名字来自一种古老而晦涩的矮人方言。他们是一个幻术刺客组织，练习的是连最精明的德鲁人或最聪明的牧师都不知道的学科。这不仅仅是一个神话，这些杀手已经从事他们的工作几个世纪了，他们的动机不明，他们的方法难以捉摸。",
	"The duergar are called gray dwarves not only because of the color of their skin, but also because of their drab and joyless lifestyle. While they make no time for merriment, the duergar have a culture as rich and complex as any other, and nowhere is this so evident as in Gracklstugh.": "杜尔加人被称为灰矮人，不仅是因为他们的皮肤颜色，而且还因为他们单调和无趣的生活方式。虽然他们没有时间欢乐，但杜尔加人的文化和其他任何人一样丰富和复杂，这一点在格拉克斯图格最明显不过了。",

They are merciless masters to the derro and slaves who toil and suffer under them.": "在刀锋之城，工作从未停止，灰矮人以效率和完美为荣，即使他们憎恶浪费和粗心。对于在他们手下劳作和受苦的德鲁人和奴隶，他们是无情的主人。",
	"By appearance and bearing, all duergar know their place and where they belong. Whether as individuals, families, or entire clans, duergar below other duergar in the social order don't seek to bring their rivals down through intrigue and deceit. Rather, they roll up their sleeves and work harder to increase their prestige through the fruits of their labor.": "从外表和气质上看，所有的龙骑兵都知道自己的位置和归属。无论是作为个人、家庭还是整个家族，在社会秩序中地位低于其他二人组的二人组并不寻求通过阴谋和欺骗打倒对手。相反，他们卷起袖子，更加努力地工作，通过他们的劳动成果提高自己的威望。",

The gray dwarves constantly try to manipulate contracts to take advantage of foreign merchants, looking for any excuse to enslave random visitors who appear weak or vulnerable—including adventurers.": "灰矮人在自己之间适用的所有荣誉和诚实并不适用于外来者。灰矮人不断试图操纵合同来占外国商人的便宜，寻找任何借口来奴役那些看起来软弱或易受伤害的随机访客--包括冒险者。",

	"Duergar clans use caverns under Gracklstugh and choice outlying caves to farm a variety of plants and fungi. These crops are complemented by meat from Underdark beasts and fish from the Darklake. Not even the duergar risk drinking water from the Darklake, however, and with clean streams in short supply, the people of Gracklstugh cover this scarcity with Darklake Stout, the signature ale brewed by the Muzgardt clan.": "Duergar部族利用Gracklstugh地下的洞穴和选择外围的洞穴来养殖各种植物和真菌。这些农作物辅以来自暗黑魔兽的肉和来自黑暗湖的鱼。然而，即使是杜尔加人也不敢冒险饮用黑暗湖的水，由于清洁的溪流供应不足，格拉克尔斯图的人们用黑暗湖黑啤酒来弥补这种匮乏，这是穆兹加德特家族酿造的标志性啤酒。",
	"The bottom rung in Gracklstugh society is mostly occupied by the underclass of the derro. Enslaved by the duergar centuries ago, then freed, the derro aren't allowed to hold honest jobs, and their rights are hardly ever recognized by the duergar. Even slaves are held in higher regard. Derro scuttle about like vermin and are mostly confined to hovels built along the walls of Laduguer's Furrow in the West Cleft District and East Cleft District.": "在Gracklstugh社会的最底层，大部分被底层的德鲁人所占据。几个世纪前，德鲁人被杜尔加人奴役，然后被释放，德鲁人不被允许从事诚实的工作，他们的权利也几乎不被杜尔加人承认。即使是奴隶也被看得很重。德罗人像害虫一样四处游荡，大多被限制在西裂谷区和东裂谷区沿着拉杜古尔之墙建造的小屋里。",
	"Another kind of outcasts are those duergar who dishonor their clans so grievously they are stripped of all but their lives: the {@i calassabrak}, meaning \"the flawed who aren't to be trusted\" in Dwarvish. They are shunned by other duergar, many eventually taking their lives rather than face an existence apart from family and clan. Those who live on become bitter and tough, with many leaving Gracklstugh as hermits or adventurers, or turning to crime and a life in the shadows. Members of both the Gray Ghosts and the Empty-Scabbard Killers include a significant number of calassabrak, no longer bound by oath, honor, and duty.": "另一种被遗弃的人是那些严重玷污了自己家族的人，他们被剥夺了所有的东西，除了他们的生命：{@i calassabrak}，在矮人语中的意思是 \"不值得信任的瑕疵者\"。他们被其他矮人回避，许多人最终宁可牺牲自己的生命也不愿面对与家人和家族分离的生活。那些活着的人变得痛苦而强硬，许多人离开格拉克斯图成为隐士或冒险家，或者转向犯罪和阴影中的生活。灰色幽灵和空鞘杀手的成员包括大量的卡拉萨布拉克人，他们不再受誓言、荣誉和责任的约束。",

	"A splinter group of the Council of Savants began worshiping Demogorgon even before the current crisis, and their foul rituals accelerated the spread of madness in the city. To make things worse, the divided nature of the city, both geographically and socially, resonates strongly with the dual aspect of Demogorgon. The derro cultists plan to offer the entire city to their newly arrived master.": "救世主委员会的一个分裂团体甚至在当前的危机之前就开始崇拜德摩根，他们的肮脏仪式加速了城市中疯狂的蔓延。更糟糕的是，这个城市的分裂性质，无论是地理上还是社会上，都与德摩根的双重性产生了强烈的共鸣。德罗邪教徒计划将整个城市献给他们新来的主人。",
	"Many duergar NPCs the characters interact with are showing the first signs of infection. Though their madness has not yet overwhelmed them, it manifests in behavior such as Errde Blackskull's conspiracy theories, Gorglak's corruption, and Gartokkar Xundorn's paranoia.": "与角色互动的许多杜尔加NPC都出现了感染的最初迹象。虽然他们的疯狂还没有淹没他们，但它表现在行为上，如厄尔德-布莱克斯库尔的阴谋论、戈尔格拉克的腐败和加托克-勋德恩的偏执。",

	"Minor crime is relatively rare in Gracklstugh. The duergar live by a strict code of honor, and their laws are few, simple, and practical. Both guards and regular citizens can be {@condition invisible} and watching, which keeps any potential criminals and dissenters uncertain and fearful. A laird may punish any member of his or her clan who commits a crime, but offenses between clans are immediately brought before the Council of Lairds, which resolves matters swiftly and harshly. The code of punishment is simple. Because dishonor, mutilation and imprisonment are a waste of resources and create weakness in society, a duergar who intentionally commits any crime receives a death sentence. Accidental crime by a duergar is compensated by goods or work equivalent to the damages. Derro, slaves or outsiders caught committing any crime can be executed on the spot by any duergar present.": "轻微犯罪在格拉克尔斯图相对罕见。杜尔加人奉行严格的荣誉准则，他们的法律很少，很简单，很实用。守卫和普通公民都可以{@condition invisible}和监视，这让任何潜在的罪犯和异议者感到不确定和恐惧。一个领主可以惩罚他或她的部族中任何犯罪的成员，但部族之间的犯罪行为会立即被提交给领主委员会，该委员会会迅速而严厉地解决问题。惩罚的准则很简单。因为羞辱、残害和监禁是对资源的浪费，并会造成社会的软弱，所以故意犯下任何罪行的duergar会被判处死刑。杜尔加人的意外犯罪将得到与损失相当的物品或工作的补偿。犯有任何罪行的德鲁人、奴隶或外人被抓获后，可由在场的任何一个杜尔加人当场处决。",

Errde swears (truthfully) that she will arrange for the characters to get safe passage out of Gracklstugh if they do as she asks.": "埃尔德的语气变得阴沉，她说她怀疑{@creature Droki|OotA}与一个涉及萨凡特理事会的阴谋有关，甚至可能与氏族领主中的分子有关。她详细描述了发现这个阴谋和清除腐败分子将为她赢得深王的极大青睐。Errde发誓（实话实说），如果人物按照她的要求做，她会安排他们安全离开Gracklstugh。",
	"Errde's suspicions of conspiracy have her looking for signs of corruption creeping among the people of Gracklstugh. She rewards the characters if they bring her evidence of such corruption that has escaped the eyes of her warriors. The characters can build a case if they witness odd events throughout Gracklstugh, such as some of the random encounters and the behavior of merchants in the Blade Bazaar. For every three such events they report, the characters can attempt a DC 15 group Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, but they only need to succeed once to convince Errde and complete this quest. Errde then promises to outfit the characters with supplies and gear when they leave Gracklstugh, from the Stone Guards' own armory. Each character can claim a total of 350 gp worth of equipment, including weapons, armor, and common potions and scrolls.": "Errde对阴谋的怀疑使她在Gracklstugh的人们中寻找腐败的迹象。如果这些人物给她带来了这种腐败的证据，而这些证据又逃过了她的战士们的眼睛，她就会给予奖励。角色们如果目睹了整个Gracklstugh的奇怪事件，比如一些随机的遭遇和刀锋集市上商人的行为，就可以建立一个案例。每报告三件这样的事件，人物就可以尝试进行DC15的团体魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查，但他们只需要成功一次就可以说服Errde并完成这个任务。然后Errde承诺在他们离开Gracklstugh的时候为他们配备物资和装备，这些物资和装备来自石卫兵自己的军械库。每个角色可以领到价值350戈比的装备，包括武器、盔甲和普通药水和卷轴。",
	"If the characters refuse Errde's offer after being arrested, they spend a few days imprisoned and then are sold back to the drow. Xalith and her squad meet up with Ilvara and then return to Velkynvelve, if the characters can't manage to escape from their captors.": "如果人物被捕后拒绝了Errde的提议，他们会被囚禁几天，然后被卖回给乌鸦。Xalith和她的小队与Ilvara会合，然后返回Velkynvelve，如果人物不能设法从俘虏那里逃脱的话。",
	"If the characters accept Errde's offer, she gives them insignias allowing them to move as far south as Laduguer's Furrow without being accosted by guards. The adventurers need only to show the insignias discreetly when confronted, and should keep them hidden otherwise. They are then released without fanfare. Errde knows about the stone giants' invitation if the characters spared the two-headed giant's life, and advises the characters to heed it before looking for {@creature Droki|OotA}.": "如果人物接受Errde的提议，她会给他们徽章，允许他们向南移动到Laduguer's Furrow而不会被卫兵发现。冒险家们只需在面对面时谨慎地出示徽章，其他情况下应将其隐藏起来。然后他们就会被释放，不需要大张旗鼓。埃尔德知道石巨人的邀请，如果他们放过双头巨人的生命，并建议他们在寻找{@creature Droki|OotA}之前听从它。",
	"The characters' pursuit level is reduced to 0 and remains so while they are in Errde's employ inside Gracklstugh.

Otherwise, it remains at 0 until some other action raises it again.": "人物的追击等级降为0，并且在他们在Gracklstugh内受雇于Errde的时候保持如此。如果他们结束雇佣，石像守卫就会停止为他们提供掩护，如果Xalith在城里，他们的追击等级就会正常提高（见 \"刀锋集市 \"章节中的 \"追击迹象\"）。否则，它将保持在0，直到其他行动再次提高它。",

These were abandoned when Deepking Tarngardt, grandfather of the current monarch, liberated the derro, allowing them to spread from the West Cleft District into the East Cleft District. The guardhouses now stand empty, providing an ideal place to lie low and keep an eye on traffic in and out of the eastern derro boroughs.": "在拉杜古尔沟的西门附近，杜尔加建造了一系列的警卫室，以监视住在西裂谷的德鲁奴隶。当现任君主的祖父迪普金-塔恩加特（Deepking Tarngardt）解放了德鲁人，让他们从西裂谷区扩散到东裂谷区时，这些看守所就被废弃了。现在，这些看守所空着，提供了一个理想的地方，可以低调地监视进出东部德洛区的交通。",

	"The homes of the derro are mostly burrows carved into the walls and simple structures piled atop one another. The dirty and cluttered streets of both districts formed as dwellings spread and came together, and not as a product of planning.

The derro are close to mounting an insurrection, held back only by their own lack of organization and by their leaders in the Council of Savants having grown too used to their privileges to foment rebellion.": "德罗人的住宅大多是刻在墙上的洞穴和堆积在一起的简单结构。这两个地区肮脏而杂乱的街道是随着住宅的扩散和聚集而形成的，而不是规划的产物。德罗人的人口要多得多，他们的隧道比杜尔加人认为的要远得多。德罗人接近于发动叛乱，只是由于他们自己缺乏组织，以及他们在萨凡特理事会的领导人已经习惯于他们的特权而无法煽动叛乱。",

	"These gentle creatures tend to the fungi patch and mind their own business, attacking only in self-defense. If the characters establish communication with the fungus folk and ask for directions to Neverlight Grove, the myconids offer to escort them to the grove and introduce them to their exalted leader, Sovereign Phylo.": "这些温和的生物照顾着真菌区，只管自己的事，只在自卫时才攻击。如果人物与菌类建立了沟通，并询问前往永光丛林的方向，菌类就会主动护送他们到丛林，并把他们介绍给他们崇高的领袖--Sovereign Phylo。",
	"These giant animated mushrooms guard the fungi patch, attacking if they are harmed or if the characters try to harvest any of the fungi.": "这些巨大的动画蘑菇守护着真菌区，如果它们受到伤害或角色试图收获任何真菌，就会进行攻击。",

	"While many passages lead to Neverlight Grove, most are little more than narrow fissures riven by trickles of water. Only one natural tunnel is fit for relatively easy travel by Medium creatures, formed by a drying underground stream and dimly lit by glowing lichen.": "虽然有许多通道通向永光丛林，但大多数都只是被涓涓细流冲刷的狭窄裂缝而已。只有一条天然通道适合中等生物相对轻松地旅行，它由一条干涸的地下溪流形成，并由发光的地衣暗中照亮。",
	"Upon entering the cavern of the grove, characters leave the horrors of the Underdark behind. They find themselves in a hidden enchanted place, strangely alien but serenely beautiful. The access tunnel opens above the grove's main floor, providing the characters a panoramic view of a mushroom forest that covers every surface—including the ceiling—and illuminates the darkness with brilliantly colorful bioluminescent patterns.": "进入小树林的洞穴后，角色们将暗黑世界的恐怖抛在脑后。他们发现自己身处一个隐秘的魔幻之地，陌生而又宁静的美丽。通道在小树林的主楼层上方打开，为人物提供了一个蘑菇森林的全景，它覆盖了每一个表面--包括天花板--并以绚丽多彩的生物发光图案照亮了黑暗。",
	"On the other side of this exotic forest, the cavern narrows into a ravine. In a cavern beyond the ravine, a glimpse of a majestic mushroom tower can be seen, although the poor light and a rising mist makes it impossible to discern its details.": "在这片异国情调的森林的另一边，岩洞缩小成一条峡谷。在峡谷外的一个洞穴里，可以看到一个雄伟的蘑菇塔，尽管光线不好，加上雾气上升，无法辨别其细节。",
	"Though the characters don't know it yet, a {@creature drow scout|OotA} patrol arrived in Neverlight Grove ahead of them, anticipating that the escaped adventurers might seek shelter among the myconids.

	"{@creature Drow scout|OotA} trapped in a horrible fate": "{@creature Drow scout|OotA}被困在一个可怕的命运中",
	"The myconid way of life is simple, contemplative, and cyclical. Myconids work for eight hours farming their fungi fields, scouting for resources, and maintaining their defenses. After their labors, they spend eight hours in telepathic communion with each other in what they call \"melding.\" They then rest for eight hours before starting the cycle anew.": "菌类的生活方式是简单的、沉思的、循环的。菌类工作八个小时，耕种他们的真菌田，侦察资源，并维护他们的防御系统。劳动结束后，他们花八个小时与对方进行心灵感应，他们称之为 \"融合\"。然后他们休息八个小时，再开始新的循环。",
	"Many of the myconids in the grove are more extroverted than might be expected of their normally shy species. Characters who communicate with the myconids by way of their rapport spores note that the creatures seem to be preparing for a celebration of some sort, proclaiming \"The day of joy is nigh!\" and exhorting others to \"Rejoice in the true union that will meld us all!\" These are the myconids affected by Zuggtmoy, and their behavior is cause for concern among the unaffected, including {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA} and its allies.": "丛林中的许多霉菌类动物都比通常情况下的害羞物种要外向得多。通过默契孢子与菌类沟通的角色注意到，这些生物似乎正在准备某种庆祝活动，它们宣称 \"欢乐的日子近了！\"并劝告其他人 \"为将我们所有人融合在一起的真正结合而欢呼！\" 这些是受Zuggtmoy影响的菌类，它们的行为引起了未受影响者的关注，包括{@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA}和它的盟友。",
	"Myconid communities normally have only a single sovereign—the largest among them, who stands alone and outside of any circle (see below). Two years ago, {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA} arrived in the grove with its two circles, and Sovereign Phylo welcomed the new myconids gladly, grateful for Basidia's offer to share the burdens of leading all the circles in the grove. The two sovereigns have been close friends ever since, sharing authority and responsibilities with no conflict. Each knows that an individual myconid has only so much time in the cycle of life, and that when both have passed, a single sovereign will take their place after their bodies are returned to nourish the soil.": "霉菌社区通常只有一个君主--他们中最大的君主，他独自站在任何圈子之外（见下文）。两年前，{@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA}带着它的两个圈子来到了小树林，主权者Phylo高兴地欢迎新的菌类，感谢Basidia提出分担领导小树林所有圈子的重任。从那时起，两位君主一直是亲密的朋友，分享权力和责任，没有冲突。每个人都知道，在生命的轮回中，一个单独的霉菌只有这么多时间，当两个人都去世后，在他们的身体回到土壤中滋养后，会有一个君主来取代他们。",
	"The circles in Neverlight Grove are divided by specialized function, with each circle performing a specific role in the colony. Seven circles are present in the grove, each containing an average of twenty myconids—the Circle of Hunters, the Circle of Explorers, the Circle of Sowers, the Circle of Builders, the Circle of Growers, plus the recently formed Inner Circle and Circle of Masters. Each circle gathers around a circle mound—a pile of rocks and soil upon which mold, lichen, and mushrooms are encouraged to grow. The myconids of a circle gather around their own mound to meld and sleep.": "永恒之光丛林中的圈子是按专门的功能划分的，每个圈子都在殖民地中发挥着特定的作用。小树林里有七个圈子，每个圈子平均有20个菌类--猎人圈子、探索者圈子、播种者圈子、建设者圈子、种植者圈子，加上最近形成的内部圈子和大师圈子。每个圈子都聚集在一个圈子的土堆周围--一堆岩石和土壤，鼓励霉菌、地衣和蘑菇在上面生长。一个圈子的菌类聚集在他们自己的圆丘周围，进行融合和睡眠。",
	"After becoming enthralled by Zuggtmoy, Phylo decided the myconids would meld exclusively within their own circle, and only the circle leaders would meld with the other circle leaders and the sovereigns. Phylo asserted that this would make all the circles' meldings far more efficient, thereby making the tending of the grove that much easier. Most of the grove's myconids have gone along with this new and unusual concept, swayed by Phylo's claims that a higher level of communal harmony will be achieved.": "在被Zuggtmoy迷住之后，Phylo决定，菌类将只在自己的圈子里融合，只有圈子的领导者才会与其他圈子的领导者和君主融合。菲洛断言，这将使所有圈子的融合更加有效，从而使小树林的管理更加容易。丛林中的大多数菌类都接受了这个新的、不寻常的概念，被菲洛声称将实现更高水平的社区和谐所动摇。",
	"Basidia believes that Phylo's separation of the circles is contrary to the unity and harmony of the myconid way of life, and that this segregation isolates individuals from the experiences of others outside their circle. Basidia has likewise expressed concern about the unnaturalness of the Inner Circle and the Circle of Masters. However, Basidia's views are either dismissed or ignored by Phylo and its allies, who zealously claim that exciting changes are coming for the grove.": "Basidia认为，Phylo对圈子的分离违背了菌类生活方式的统一性和和谐性，这种隔离使个人与他们圈子以外的其他人的经验相隔离。Basidia也同样对 \"内部圈子 \"和 \"大师圈子 \"的不自然性表示担忧。然而，Basidia的观点要么被Phylo及其盟友驳回，要么被他们忽视，他们热衷于宣称丛林即将发生激动人心的变化。",
	"A more recent development has Basidia even more disturbed when the adventurers arrive in Neverlight Grove. {@creature Yestabrod|OotA}, the leader of the Circle of Masters, has not attended an Inner Circle melding for several days now, instead sending a representative (see \"The Circle of Masters\" in area 5). Times in Neverlight Grove are strange and worrisome indeed.": "当冒险者们到达永光丛林时，一个更近的发展让巴西迪亚更加不安了。{@creature Yestabrod|OotA}，大师圈的领袖，已经好几天没有参加内圈的融合了，而是派了一个代表（见第五区的 \"大师圈\"）。永光丛林的时代确实很奇怪，也很令人担忧。",
	"Myconids lead lives completely unlike the experiences of any surface dweller. The only things they have in common with humanoids are the need for sustenance, the desire to live, and the joy of socialization, although they practice each of these things in different ways than humanoids. Truly alien creatures, myconids have difficulty telling flesh-and-blood humanoids apart.": "菌类所过的生活与任何地面居民的经历完全不同。他们与人类的唯一共同点是对食物的需求，对生活的渴望，以及社交的乐趣，尽管他们以不同于人类的方式实践这些事情。作为真正的外星生物，菌类很难区分有血有肉的类人。",
	"Myconids are innocent about matters of ethics and morality, their lives centered on living fully each day and worrying little about the future and nothing at all about the past. Despite the communal nature of their existence, they are individuals with their own unique interests and distinct personalities. They gravitate toward simple, shared joys, living by the wisdom and insight their melding provides. Because of their naive and sharing ways, as well as their fungal nature, they are extremely vulnerable to the corrupting influence of Zuggtmoy.": "霉菌在伦理和道德问题上是无辜的，他们的生活中心是充分地过好每一天，对未来很少担心，对过去根本不担心。尽管他们的存在具有公共性，但他们是有自己独特兴趣和独特个性的个体。他们倾向于简单的、共享的快乐，靠他们的融合提供的智慧和洞察力生活。由于他们的天真和分享方式，以及他们的真菌性质，他们非常容易受到Zuggtmoy的腐蚀影响。",
	"The myconids of Neverlight Grove are beginning to reel from the Lady of Decay's influence, with many blissfully welcoming her madness, while others bravely try to resist it. Myconids affected by Zuggtmoy abandon the growth of life as the core of their being in favor of decay and death. More horrifying is that they do so with childlike innocence, reveling in the corruption of all life with a sense of wonder and joy, unable to grasp the evil they have embraced.": "梦幻树丛的菌类开始受到腐烂女士的影响，许多人幸福地欢迎她的疯狂，而其他人则勇敢地试图抵制它。受Zuggtmoy影响的菌类放弃了作为其存在核心的生命成长，而选择了腐烂和死亡。更可怕的是，他们在这样做的时候还带着孩子般的天真，以一种好奇和喜悦的心情陶醉于所有生命的腐败，无法理解他们所拥抱的邪恶。",
	"Myconids share everything through melding. Rapport spores carry a tiny bit of all myconids to the other myconids in their circle, to be absorbed and reside within them, and creating a telepathic familial bond. When the myconids of a circle gather to meld, they share their individual insights, fears, hopes, and dreams. Through the melding, all myconids join together to form the heart and soul of a colony.": "霉菌类通过融合分享一切。和谐孢子将所有霉菌的一小部分带到他们圈子里的其他霉菌身上，被他们吸收并居住在其中，并创造一种心灵感应的家庭纽带。当一个圈子的霉菌聚集在一起进行融合时，他们会分享各自的见解、恐惧、希望和梦想。通过融合，所有的菌类都结合在一起，形成一个菌群的核心和灵魂。",
	"Initially weakened by the summoning ritual that wrenched her from the Abyss, Zuggtmoy found her way to Neverlight Grove, drawn by the strength of its fungal vitality. Upon her arrival, she quickly assessed the situation, realizing the shortest path to gain control of the grove would be to sway and corrupt its original sovereign to serve her until she recovered her strength.": "扎格莫伊最初被从深渊中召唤出来的仪式所削弱，她被永光丛林的真菌活力所吸引，找到了自己的道路。到达后，她迅速评估了情况，意识到获得丛林控制权的最短途径是动摇和腐蚀它原来的统治者，使其为她服务，直到她恢复力量。",
	"After being welcomed to the grove by Phylo, Zuggtmoy melded with the sovereign in secret, seducing it with the promise of a paradise for the mushroom folk if Phylo would lead them to become her followers on the Material Plane. Its mind completely lost inside the demon queen's insidiously mad vision, Phylo became enthralled by the promise of plentiful soil and moisture, perpetual rot, and beautiful transcendent dreams to be shared in a never-ending communal melding—all offered to the grove's folk as generous and wondrous gifts from the Lady of Decay.": "在受到菲洛的欢迎后，祖格莫伊秘密地与君主融合在一起，诱惑它承诺如果菲洛能带领他们成为她在物质世界的追随者，就能为蘑菇族提供一个天堂。Phylo完全迷失在恶魔女王阴险疯狂的视野中，它被丰富的土壤和水分、永久的腐烂和美丽的超凡梦想的承诺所迷惑，在一个永无止境的集体融合中分享这些东西--所有这些都是腐烂女士慷慨而奇妙的礼物，提供给丛林的人们的。",
	"Everyday melding has now become a subtle ideological war between supporters of the two myconid sovereigns. Phylo is slowly convincing the mushroom folk to follow the new path. Basidia and its dwindling supporters argue against the new way, even as they lose ground (and allies) each time the circles of the grove share consciousness.": "日常的融合现在已经成为两个菌类主权支持者之间微妙的意识形态战争。Phylo正在慢慢地说服蘑菇族人遵循新的道路。Basidia和它不断减少的支持者们则反对新的道路，甚至在每次小树林的圈子分享意识时，他们都会失去阵地（和盟友）。",
	"As more and more myconids unwittingly become vessels for Zuggtmoy's spores, Neverlight Grove becomes a more extravagantly festive place. The quiet, contemplative joy of the mushroom folk's way of life is being inexorably replaced by decadent, enraptured euphoria—and the madness that euphoria hides.": "随着越来越多的菌类不知不觉地成为Zuggtmoy孢子的容器，Neverlight Grove变成了一个更加奢侈的节日场所。蘑菇民的生活方式的安静、沉思的快乐正不可避免地被颓废、陶醉的欣快感所取代，以及欣快感所隐藏的疯狂。",
	"{@b Population}: 150 myconids and spore servants": "{@b Population}: 150个菌类和孢子仆人",
	"{@b Government}: Organized circles ruled by larger specimens called circle leaders; even larger specimens called sovereigns rule the entire colony": "{@b Government}: 有组织的圈子由较大的标本统治，称为圈子领袖；甚至更大的标本称为君主，统治整个殖民地",

	"Myconids have lived in Neverlight Grove for untold generations, experiencing little or no change in their lives until recently. Now their world is being altered faster than many of the fungus folk can keep up with—as is their world view, twisted by the chaotic and corrupting influence of the Demon Queen of Fungi.": "菌类在永光丛林中生活了不知多少代，直到最近，他们的生活几乎没有任何变化。现在，他们的世界被改变的速度超过了许多菌民所能跟上的速度--就像他们的世界观一样，被混乱和腐化的真菌女王的影响所扭曲。",
	"Upon her arrival in the Underdark, Zuggtmoy found Neverlight Grove and took up residence there. The myconids welcomed her, sealing their fate. Through telepathically shared dreams, corruption has taken root deep within the colony, warping the myconids' normally placid and peaceful nature into something restive and rapturous. A few realize what is happening and try to resist, but internal strife is alien to the myconids—they will not prevail without outside aid to save them.": "抵达暗黑世界后，扎格莫伊找到了永光丛林，并在那里住了下来。菌类对她表示欢迎，封住了他们的命运。通过心灵感应的共享梦境，腐败已经在殖民地的深处扎根，将菌类通常平和的天性扭曲成躁动和狂喜的东西。少数人意识到了正在发生的事情，并试图进行抵抗，但内部纷争对菌类来说是陌生的--如果没有外部援助来拯救他们，他们将无法获胜。",
	"Visitors encounter the following features throughout Neverlight Grove.": "游客在整个Neverlight Grove遇到了以下特征。",
	"Water trickles into the large cavern from many places, forming terraces, pools, and streams. This creates an underground marsh ideal for the growth of fungi and the myconids.": "水从许多地方流进大洞穴，形成梯田、水池和溪流。这创造了一个地下沼泽，非常适合真菌和菌类的生长。",
	"Mushrooms, molds, and fungi grow in abundance in Neverlight Grove, creating a bizarre yet beautiful tapestry of color.": "蘑菇、霉菌和真菌在永光丛林中大量生长，创造出一种奇异而美丽的色彩织锦。",
	"Myconids don't speak. They communicate telepathically by emitting their rapport spores. As a result, they live quiet lives. Strange music and singing echoes from the large cavern behind the grove, just loud enough to be noticeable.": "菌类不说话。它们通过散发它们的和睦相处孢子进行心灵感应。因此，它们过着安静的生活。奇怪的音乐和歌声从小树林后面的大洞穴中回荡，声音大到足以让人注意。",
	"Luminescent lichen grows across the cavern and spreads to the larger mushrooms, bathing the grove in soft hues of yellow, blue, and violet. Dim light suffuses the entire grove and lends the grove a dreamlike quality.": "发光地衣在洞穴中生长，并蔓延到较大的蘑菇上，使丛林沐浴在黄色、蓝色和紫色的柔和色调中。昏暗的光线充斥着整个丛林，使丛林具有梦幻般的品质。",
	"The myconids cultivate this stretch of wilderness as their first line of defense, creating a living palisade. Fungal creatures and wild Underdark beasts form a rich ecosystem here.": "菌类将这片荒野作为他们的第一道防线来培养，创造了一个活生生的宫墙。真菌生物和野生地下城野兽在这里形成了丰富的生态系统。",
	"Pale cream and beige stalks grow thick and tall, resembling a surface world forest. Fungi grow in profusion everywhere, and it's hard to find anything resembling a path between them. The giant caps of zurkhwood mushrooms obscure your view of the cavern's ceiling, but luminescent fungi there give off a shimmering aura. With each step taken on the soggy ground, a rank scent of decay rises around you.": "淡奶油色和米色的茎秆长得又粗又高，类似于表面世界的森林。真菌到处生长，在它们之间很难找到类似于道路的东西。巨大的紫檀木蘑菇帽遮住了你对洞穴天花板的视线，但那里的发光真菌散发出闪亮的光环。在潮湿的地面上每走一步，你周围就会升起一股腐烂的气味。",
	"A circle mound sits at the edge of the wilds but still inside them. It belongs to the Circle of Hunters—myconids that pursue creatures in the wilds. In spite of their name, the hunters don't kill their prey, but merely track down creatures that have died near the grove. The hunters bring the remains of such creatures back to be reanimated by their sovereigns, until they are eventually allowed to rot and join the cavern's detritus bed.": "一个圆丘坐落在荒野的边缘，但仍在荒野之内。它属于 \"猎人圈\"--在荒野中追捕生物的菌类。尽管他们的名字叫 \"猎人\"，但他们并不杀死他们的猎物，而只是追踪那些死在小树林附近的生物。猎人将这些生物的遗体带回来，由他们的主人重新激活，直到它们最终被允许腐烂，加入洞穴的碎屑床。",
	"The circle leader of the hunters, this tall and lean myconid shares Basidia's concerns about Phylo's new way, though it is still capable of resisting Phylo's corrupted meldings when it joins with the Inner Circle. Loobamub keeps its opinions to itself, but its wariness spreads to the other hunters when they meld, cementing their loyalty to Basidia. Loobamub redirects the spore servants and awakened zurkhwoods Phylo creates away from its circle's territory.": "作为猎人的圈子领袖，这个高大精干的菌人与巴西迪亚一样，对菲洛的新方式感到担忧，尽管它在加入内部圈子时仍有能力抵制菲洛的腐化融合。Loobamub对自己的意见保持沉默，但当其他猎人融合时，它的戒心会蔓延到其他猎人身上，巩固他们对Basidia的忠诚。Loobamub将Phylo创造的孢子仆人和被唤醒的Zurkhwoods从它的圈子的领土上重新定向。",
	"The terraces lining the northern walls are suffused with {@i faerzress}, and the myconids reserve these areas for cultivating certain fungi.": "衬托北墙的梯田充斥着{@i faerzress}，菌类保留了这些区域用于栽培某些真菌。",
	"Water trickling from the walls of this vast cavern are channeled into a crude but effective terraced irrigation system. A thick, sweet smell fills the air from the thousands of fungi of all colors and sizes, many glowing with a strange, inviting light.": "从这个巨大的洞穴壁上淌下的水被引向一个粗糙但有效的梯田灌溉系统。空气中弥漫着一股浓郁的甜味，这来自于数以千计的各种颜色和大小的真菌，许多真菌发出一种奇怪的、诱人的光。",
	"This circle is found in the middle terrace, but its members travel to the top and the edges of the cave to harvest the resilient fungi used in their craft.": "这个圈子是在中间的平台上发现的，但其成员会到洞顶和洞边去采摘用于其工艺的弹性真菌。",
	"The builders' circle leader is a pioneering would-be architect and a supporter of Sovereign Phylo. Already driven mad by Zuggtmoy's spores, Gasbide dreams of bizarre, elaborate structures no myconids would ever need, inspired by visions of Abyssal palaces.": "建筑师圈子的领导者是一个具有开拓精神的未来建筑师，也是Sovereign Phylo的支持者。Gasbide已经被Zuggtmoy的孢子逼疯了，他梦想着奇异的、精心设计的结构，没有菌类会需要，他的灵感来自深渊宫殿的愿景。",
	"If Gasbide interacts with the characters using rapport spores, it demands descriptions of surface-world structures, bristling with an excitement seldom seen in myconids. It asks for exasperatingly minor details such as the precise dimensions of bricks or the density of lumber. Gasbide reveals through the rapport that it dreams of building a fungal tower \"even greater than Yggmorgus.\" It hopes to break through the Underdark to the surface world, possibly \"with the aid of Araumycos.\" Gasbide has no conscious knowledge of what Araumycos is, sensing only that it is part of the great celebration to come. See \"{@area Yggmorgus|257|x}\" (at the end of this chapter) and chapter 16, \"{@adventure The Fetid Wedding|OotA|15},\" for more information.": "如果Gasbide使用和睦相处的孢子与人物互动，它要求描述表面世界的结构，充满了在菌类中很少见的兴奋感。它要求提供令人厌烦的小细节，如砖的精确尺寸或木材的密度。加斯比德通过这种关系透露，它梦想建造一座 \"比Yggmorgus还要伟大 \"的真菌塔。它希望能突破地下世界到达地面世界，可能 \"在Araumycos的帮助下\"。加斯比德没有意识到Araumycos是什么，只感觉到它是即将到来的伟大庆典的一部分。更多信息见\"{@area Yggmorgus|257|x}\"（本章末）和第16章\"{@adventure The Fetid Wedding|OotA|15}\"。",
	"The circle mound of the growers is on the top terrace, near the cavern wall. The growers are the colony's farmers, ensuring the soil beneath the pools remains fertile and tending the fungi there.": "种植者的圆丘在顶层平台上，靠近洞壁。种植者是殖民地的农民，确保水池下面的土壤保持肥沃，并照料那里的真菌。",
	"The leader of the growers doesn't care much for Phylo's new ideas. But though it misses mass meldings, Hebopbe doesn't see Basidia's protests as worthy of concern. Hebopbe is infected by Zuggtmoy's spores, but isn't yet under her control.": "种植者的领袖并不太在意菲洛的新想法。但虽然错过了大规模的融合，但Hebopbe并不认为Basidia的抗议值得关注。Hebopbe被Zuggtmoy的孢子所感染，但还没有被她控制。",
	"This depression in the cavern floor is the main part of the myconid colony. The central circle mound was only recently created, and is now a kind of \"town square\" where all the grove's myconids gather for mass meldings. These have become rare, however, reserved for when Phylo wants to stoke the myconids' enthusiasm for the celebration that only those infected by Zuggtmoy know about. This leaves the uninfected confused but happy that something joyous is about to happen.": "洞底的这个洼地是菌类聚居地的主要部分。中央的圆丘是最近才创建的，现在是一种 \"城市广场\"，丛林中所有的霉菌都聚集在这里进行大规模的融合。然而，这已经变得很罕见了，只保留在菲洛想激起菌类对庆祝活动的热情时，只有那些被Zuggtmoy感染的人知道。这让未受感染的人感到困惑，但又为即将发生的快乐的事情感到高兴。",
	"Beyond the mud and mushrooms that spread across the cavern, a large, clear pool sits in the midst of the fungal grove. A central mound seems to be the only dry spot in sight, though a small cliff rises above the cavern floor far across the clearing, with giant mushrooms visible in the distance. Bioluminescent fungi trace strange constellations along the cavern's ceiling and walls, showing the darkness of the ravine and a mist-shrouded smaller cavern beyond.": "在遍布洞穴的泥浆和蘑菇之外，一个巨大而清澈的水池坐落在真菌丛林的中间。一个中央小丘似乎是眼前唯一干燥的地方，尽管一个小悬崖在空地上远远地耸立在洞底，远处可见巨大的蘑菇。生物发光的真菌沿着洞穴的天花板和墙壁描画出奇怪的星座，显示出峡谷的黑暗和外面雾气笼罩的小洞穴。",
	"The sovereign towers above the other myconids, its multiple caps swaying with the sinuous shifting of its thick stalk as it moves. Once it spreads its rapport spores, Phylo welcomes the characters with honest enthusiasm—doubly so if they have returned {@creature Stool|OotA} and {@creature Rumpadump|OotA} to their home.": "这个君主高高耸立在其他菌类之上，它的多个菌盖随着它粗大的菌柄的蜿蜒晃动而移动。一旦它传播了它的和睦相处孢子，菲洛就会以真诚的热情欢迎这些人物--如果他们已经回到了{@creature Stool|OotA}和{@creature Rumpadump|OotA}的家，那就更是如此。",

	"Phylo invites the characters to stay as long as they wish, inviting them to explore and enjoy the many delights of Neverlight Grove. He politely asks that they avoid the eastern plateau because the Circle of Masters is preparing \"a wondrous and glorious surprise\" in the Garden of Welcome. Phylo offers to give them a peek the next day if they want. If Sarith is with the characters, he suggests they accept this offer, saying that keeping on the sovereign's good side will help the party in the long term. In truth, he is attempting to deliver the adventurers to Zuggtmoy.": "菲洛邀请这些人物在此停留，只要他们愿意，请他们探索并享受永光丛林的诸多乐趣。他礼貌地要求他们避开东部的高原，因为大师们正在欢迎花园准备 \"一个奇妙而光荣的惊喜\"。菲洛提出，如果他们愿意的话，可以在第二天让他们看一看。如果萨利斯和这些人物在一起，他建议他们接受这个提议，并说保持与君主的良好关系将长期帮助他们。事实上，他是想把冒险者们送到扎格莫伊那里。",
	"Phylo goes on about how \"the Great Seeder\" who lives beyond the garden can answer any questions they have. The sovereign describes this entity in favorable terms, using \"she\" and \"her\" as it does so. Because myconids have no concept of gender, this unusual speech is further indication of Phylo's madness. However, the sovereign dodges any question about who the Great Seeder actually is, saying it is important for the characters to experience her first hand.": "Phylo继续说，住在花园外的 \"伟大的播种者 \"可以回答他们的任何问题。主权者用有利的术语描述了这个实体，在描述时使用了 \"她 \"和 \"她\"。因为菌类没有性别的概念，这种不寻常的说话方式进一步表明了菲洛的疯狂。然而，君主回避了任何关于大播种者究竟是谁的问题，他说重要的是让人物亲身体验她。",
	"When alone with the characters, Basidia warns them about staying in Neverlight Grove too long. It tells them another group of \"softers\" (the name myconids use for fleshy creatures) arrived not too many cycles ago and accepted Phylo's offer. They were taken to the Garden of Welcome and Basidia hasn't seen them since, nor has Phylo made any further mention of them (see \"Questions for the Sovereigns\"). Basidia also tells the characters that the Circle of Masters is taking most of the carcasses the Circle of Hunters bring in, and are sending groups of myconids outside the grove without telling anybody.": "当与这些人物单独在一起时，Basidia警告他们不要在Neverlight Grove呆得太久。它告诉他们，另一群 \"软体人\"（菌类对肉体生物的称呼）在不久前来到这里，接受了菲洛的提议。他们被带到了欢迎花园，此后Basidia再也没有见过他们，Phylo也没有再提过他们（见 \"对统治者的疑问\"）。Basidia还告诉角色们，\"大师圈 \"拿走了 \"猎人圈 \"带来的大部分尸体，并在不告诉任何人的情况下把一群群的菌类送到丛林外。",
	"If Basidia rapports with Sarith or any other non-myconid infected with Zuggtmoy's spores, it senses the alien nature of the demon lord's corruption. It can't identify Zuggtmoy's spores, but knows only that it has not encountered them before. This is unusual, Basidia tells the party, since most myconid sovereigns recognize all spores produced by myconids throughout the Underdark.": "如果Basidia与Sarith或任何其他感染了Zuggtmoy孢子的非真菌类动物建立了联系，它就会感觉到恶魔领主的腐败的异类性质。它无法识别扎格莫伊的孢子，只知道它以前没有遇到过它们。这很不寻常，巴西迪亚告诉大家，因为大多数霉菌君主都能认出整个暗黑世界的所有霉菌产生的孢子。",
	"If the characters ask the sovereigns to help them return to the surface world, both are apologetic that they know of no routes. However, Basidia notes that during its colony's migration, the many travelers from the surface world they encountered were mostly merchants on their way to or from Blingdenstone, Gracklstugh, or Menzoberranzan.": "如果人物要求君主帮助他们返回地表世界，两人都很抱歉地表示他们不知道任何路线。然而，Basidia指出，在其殖民地的迁移过程中，他们遇到的许多来自地表世界的旅行者大多是来往于Blingdenstone、Gracklstugh或Menzoberranzan的商人。",
	"Basidia offers to give the party a guided tour of all the circles in areas 1 through 4, where it introduces them to the respective circle leaders, pointing out which leaders support it, and which ones support Sovereign Phylo. Basidia uses this time away from Phylo to express its fear that Phylo has contracted some sort of \"diseased spore.\" Basidia thinks that a clue to the spore's nature might be found in the Garden of Welcome. Basidia asks the characters to investigate the garden, fearing to do so itself in case it also falls victim to Phylo's disease.": "Basidia提出要带着党员参观1到4区的所有圈子，在那里向他们介绍各自的圈子领袖，指出哪些领袖支持它，哪些支持Sovereign Phylo。Basidia利用这段远离Phylo的时间，表达了它对Phylo感染了某种 \"患病孢子 \"的担心。Basidia认为，在欢迎花园中可能会发现关于孢子性质的线索。Basidia要求角色们调查这个花园，但又害怕自己这样做，以防它也成为Phylo疾病的受害者。",
	"If the characters complete Basidia's quest, the myconid sovereign digs up a small box buried in the earth and gives it to them. The box contains curiosities Basidia has collected from dead travelers over the years. The box is unlocked, made of fine wood inlaid with silver, and worth 25 gp by itself. It contains three amethysts (100 gp each), four small diamonds (50 gp each), and one large diamond (500 gp).": "如果角色们完成了巴西迪亚的任务，霉菌君主就会挖出一个埋在土里的小盒子，并把它交给他们。盒子里装着Basidia多年来从死去的旅行者那里收集的奇珍异宝。盒子没有上锁，由镶嵌着银子的上等木头制成，本身就价值25金币。里面有三颗紫水晶（每颗100金币），四颗小钻石（每颗50金币），和一颗大钻石（500金币）。",
	"This circle mound is devoted to sporing new myconids. Freshly spored myconids are only a few inches tall and have no awareness, but they grow quickly into myconid sprouts.": "这个圆丘专门用来孢子新菌种。新生的孢子菌只有几英寸高，没有意识，但它们很快就会长成孢子菌的芽。",
	"The circle leader is infected by Zuggtmoy's madness. It is always swaying to music only it can hear, but those in rapport with Yrberop can hear a faint echo of its internal cacophony. Yrberop is enthusiastic about Phylo's plan to spread the happiness brought by the Great Seeder to everyone in the Underdark and beyond. For that to happen, the colony needs many more sprouts.": "圈子里的领袖被Zuggtmoy的疯狂所感染。它总是在只有它能听到的音乐中摇摆，但那些与Yrberop关系融洽的人可以听到它内部的微弱回声。Yrberop热衷于Phylo的计划，即把伟大的播种者带来的快乐传播给暗黑世界和其他地方的每个人。为了实现这一目标，殖民地需要更多的萌芽。",
	"If the characters confer with Basidia, {@creature Stool|OotA}, or {@creature Rumpadump|OotA}, these myconids tell them this push to expand the population is unusual, given the balance that the myconids have endeavored to maintain in Neverlight Grove for so long.": "如果人物与Basidia、{@creature Stool|OotA}或{@creature Rumpadump|OotA}商议，这些菌类就会告诉他们，鉴于菌类长期以来努力在Neverlight Grove维持的平衡，这种扩大人口的推动是不寻常的。",
	"The terraces along the southern rim of the cavern are narrower and not as fertile as the northern ones.": "沿着岩洞南缘的梯田比较狭窄，不像北部的梯田那样肥沃。",
	"These terraces are quiet and calm. The only sounds here are soft, \"ploopy\" splashes as water drips from stalactites above onto the caps of oversized mushrooms sprouting from mushy earth.": "这些梯田是安静和平静的。这里唯一的声音是，当水从上面的钟乳石滴到从泥土中长出的超大蘑菇的盖子上时，发出柔和的、\"噗噗 \"的水花。",
	"This circle is the smallest in Neverlight Grove, since it is merely the temporary home for restless myconids that brave the Underdark as scouts, patrols, and pathfinders.": "这个圈子是Neverlight Grove中最小的，因为它只是那些作为侦察兵、巡逻队和探路者勇闯暗黑世界的不安分的菌类的临时家。",
	"This circle leader is loyal to Basidia. Frequent trips outside the grove have allowed Rasharoo to notice the changes in Phylo and the entire colony more sharply, and it now trusts nothing and no one except Basidia. Its paranoia isn't the product of Zuggtmoy's corruption, however, but of the rising madness gripping the Underdark from the intrusion of the demon lords. If the characters demonstrate sympathy with Basidia or if the sovereign is with them, Rasharoo discloses it has a few escape plans ready, and has nutrient caches hidden along exit tunnels in case Basidia decides it is better to abandon the grove and return to a nomadic lifestyle.": "这个圈子的领导者对巴西迪亚很忠诚。经常到小树林以外的地方去，让Rasharoo更敏锐地注意到Phylo和整个殖民地的变化，它现在除了Basidia之外，什么都不相信，也不相信任何人。然而，它的偏执并不是Zuggtmoy腐败的产物，而是由于恶魔领主的入侵而使暗黑世界的疯狂程度上升。如果人物表现出对巴西迪亚的同情，或者君主和他们在一起，拉沙鲁就会透露它已经准备好了一些逃跑计划，并在出口通道上藏有营养品，以防巴西迪亚决定放弃丛林，回到游牧生活中去。",
	"Characters can climb the eastern corner of the top terrace to reach area 5, and Rasharoo gladly helps them if they head to the Garden of Welcome at Basidia's request.": "角色们可以爬上顶层露台的东边一角到达5号区域，如果他们应Basidia的要求前往欢迎花园，Rasharoo很乐意帮助他们。",
	"Among the myconids, Rasharoo and its circle are the adventurers' best hope of finding a way back to the surface. Rasharoo knows many promising paths, but since myconids have no interest in the sunlit world, it has never followed them all the way there. The circle leader helps the characters only after they complete Basidia's quest, assigning one of its explorers to guide the characters to their destination.": "在菌类中，Rasharoo和它的圈子是冒险家们找到返回地面的最好希望。拉沙鲁知道许多有希望的道路，但由于菌类对阳光世界没有兴趣，它从来没有一直跟随他们到那里。圈子领袖只有在人物完成巴西迪亚的任务后才会帮助他们，指派它的一个探险家来引导人物到达目的地。",
	"Phylo has converted this unused terrace for the exciting new ideas that Zuggtmoy has inspired in it—ideas that are \"too incredible\" for the rest of the colony to absorb at once. This so-called garden is just a sample of the horrors that Zuggtmoy, the Demon Queen of Fungi, intends to bring to the Underdark.": "菲洛将这个闲置的露台改造成Zuggtmoy在其中激发的令人兴奋的新想法--这些想法 \"太不可思议了\"，殖民地的其他成员无法一下子吸收。这个所谓的花园只是Zuggtmoy，真菌的恶魔女王，打算带给地下世界的恐怖的一个样本。",
	"This plateau rises higher than the other terraces, screened by a natural fence of soaring zurkhwood stalks. Muffled murmuring can be heard from atop the plateau.": "这片高原比其他梯田高，被高耸的紫檀树杆组成的天然栅栏挡住。从高原上可以听到低沉的杂音。",
	"The newest circle in the colony, the Circle of Masters is formed exclusively by myconids touched by Zuggtmoy. These myconids share Phylo's vision of happiness spread through Zuggtmoy's spores, experimenting on the carcasses brought to them by the hunters—or on live prisoners they hunt in their own expeditions outside the grove. Their mound lies at the center of an obscene garden.": "殖民地的最新圈子，\"大师之圈 \"是由被Zuggtmoy触动的菌类专门组成。这些菌类分享菲洛通过Zuggtmoy的孢子传播的幸福观，在猎人带来的尸体上做实验，或者在他们自己在丛林外的探险中猎取的活人身上做实验。他们的土丘位于一个淫秽花园的中心。",
	"Mutated by Zuggtmoy's spores, the circle leader has become an abomination. No longer recognizable as a myconid, it looks like a fungal larva slithering along the ground. Mold and lichen grow in hypnotic patterns along its ringed stalk, and it puffs clouds of spores from a slit resembling a mouth. It can use this orifice to actually speak, rather than depending on rapport spores. It no longer attends melds with the other leaders, instead sending its representative.": "被Zuggtmoy的孢子变异后，圆环首领已经变成了一个可憎的东西。它不再是可识别的菌类，看起来像一个在地面上滑行的真菌幼虫。霉菌和地衣沿着它的环状柄以催眠的方式生长，它从一个类似于嘴巴的缝隙中喷出孢子云。它可以用这个口子真正地说话，而不是依靠和睦的孢子。它不再参加与其他领导人的融合，而是派出它的代表。",
	"As the characters enter the garden, they make a frightening discovery.": "当人物进入花园时，他们有了一个可怕的发现。",
	"The low muttering grows louder as you reach the top, turning into a symphony of moans, cries, and hisses. The only light comes from a few glowing mushrooms along the edge, but even in the gloom, you can't miss the source of the sounds. The heads of creatures of a dozen humanoid Underdark races peek from the ground, mold and fungi growing around them.": "当你到达山顶时，低沉的咕哝声越来越大，变成了呻吟、哭喊和嘶嘶声的交响乐。唯一的光亮来自边缘的几个发光的蘑菇，但即使在阴暗中，你也不会错过声音的来源。十几个人形暗黑种族的生物的头颅从地面上探出，霉菌和真菌在它们周围生长。",
	"One voice calls out loudly in Undercommon—a female drow fighting to speak. \"Please... for your gods of light... kill me!\" She manages to stir within her living grave, raising a spider medallion half-embedded in the bloated growth that was once her hand. Half her face is rotten and pustulate, a bed for the sprouting of scores of tiny mushrooms. \"The Great Seeder... trap... she's here... the Lady of Decay... Zuggtmoy...\"": "有一个声音在地下城大声呼唤，一个女乌鸦奋力说话。\"请......为了你们的光明之神......杀了我！\" 她设法在她的活人墓里搅动，举起一个蜘蛛勋章，半截埋在曾经是她的手的臃肿的东西里。她的半边脸已经腐烂和化脓，成为几十个小蘑菇发芽的床。\"伟大的播种者......陷阱......她在这里......腐烂的女士...... Zuggtmoy...\"",
	"The drow is Xinaya, a young acolyte of Lolth. She was leading a routine scouting patrol out of Velkynvelve before Ilvara contacted her with a {@spell sending} spell. The patrol was ordered to search near the grove for the characters, anticipating that the escapees might seek shelter among the peaceful mushroom folk.": "这个乌鸦是辛纳亚，是洛尔思的年轻圣徒。在伊尔瓦拉用{@spell sending}的法术联系她之前，她正带领一支常规的侦察巡逻队离开维尔基维尔。巡逻队被命令在小树林附近搜索这些人物，预计逃跑者可能会在和平的蘑菇民中寻求庇护。",
	"After the characters speak with Xinaya, {@creature Yestabrod|OotA} appears (see {@adventure appendix C|OotA|19}). The master of the foul garden takes delight in toying with trespassers.": "在人物与辛纳亚对话后，{@creature Yestabrod|OotA}出现（见{@adventure appendix C|OotA|19}）。肮脏花园的主人以玩弄闯入者为乐。",
	"The moans of the garden's victims suddenly take on a new tone of fear as something moves across the foul ground. A disgusting larval creature rises up before you, showing only vestigial fungal growths that hint that it might once have been a myconid.": "当有东西在肮脏的地面上移动时，花园里受害者的呻吟声突然有了一种新的恐惧语气。一个恶心的幼虫在你面前升起，只露出残余的真菌生长，暗示它可能曾经是一个菌类。",
	"\"Welcome, travelers.\" The aberrant myconid's voice gurgles and spits as it speaks both aloud and in your minds at once. \"Are you here for the wedding rehearsal? Friends of the bride or her intended? No matter! Let the love of the Great Seeder embrace you as you become one with her chosen, the Great Body!\"": "\"欢迎，旅行者们。\" 这个反常的霉菌的声音咕噜咕噜地吐着，它同时在你们的头脑中大声说话。\"你们是来参加婚礼彩排的吗？新娘的朋友还是她的意中人？没有关系! 让伟大的播种者的爱拥抱你们，因为你们将与她所选择的伟大的身体融为一体！\"",
	"As the garden comes alive with screams from its buried victims, {@creature Yestabrod|OotA} raises two {@creature Drow Spore Servant|OotA|drow spore servants} (see {@adventure appendix C|OotA|19}). At the same time, two {@creature Myconid Adult||myconid adults} from the Circle of Masters emerge from the surrounding growth, all of the creatures following the circle leader as he attacks.": "当花园里传来被埋葬的受害者的尖叫声时，{@creature Yestabrod|OotA}提出了两个{@creature Drow Spore Servant|OotA|drow spore servants}（见{@adventure appendix C|OotA|19}）。同时，大师之圈的两个{@creature Myconid Adult||myconid adults}从周围的生长物中出现，所有的生物都跟着圈中的领导者一起攻击。",
	"If {@creature Yestabrod|OotA} is slain and there are still drow spore servants active, they go limp and stop attacking, at which point the myconids from the Circle of Masters attempt to flee.": "如果{@creature Yestabrod|OotA}被杀，并且仍有乌鸦孢子仆从在活动，它们就会瘫软下来并停止攻击，这时，大师之圈的菌类就会试图逃离。",
	"Xinaya's equipment is piled in a heap not far from where she was buried. Characters searching the pile find a suit of {@item +2 studded leather armor}, a {@item +2 shortsword}, and a {@item bag of holding} containing two {@item Spell Scroll||spell scrolls} ({@spell remove curse} and {@spell spider climb}), 40 days of rations, and 320 sp. The drow spore servants wear chain shirts and carry shortswords. All of the armor and weapons found here are of drow construction (see the \"Drowcraft Items\" sidebar in {@adventure appendix B|OotA|18}).": "辛纳亚的装备在她被埋葬的地方不远处堆成了一堆。搜索这堆装备的角色发现了一套{@item +2 studded leather armor}、一套{@item +2 shortsword}和一套{@item bag of holding}，里面有两件{@item Spell Scroll||spell scrolls}({@spell remove curse}和{@spell spider climb})、40天的口粮和320sp。在这里发现的所有盔甲和武器都是鸦人制造的（见{@adventure appendix B|OotA|18}中的 \"鸦人工艺物品 \"侧边栏）。",
	"After the confrontation with {@creature Yestabrod|OotA}, the characters can hear sound and movement from the cavern to the northeast. Read the following boxed text if the characters investigate.": "在与{@creature Yestabrod|OotA}对峙后，人物可以听到来自东北面洞穴的声音和运动。如果人物进行调查，请阅读以下方框内的文字。",
	"Echoes spill from the misty cavern beyond, a cacophony of wheezing voices that wrap together like some kind of discordant music. The remaining heads planted in the Garden of Welcome begin to croak and groan, joining the horrible song.": "回声从缥缈的洞穴外溢出，是喘息的声音，像某种不和谐的音乐一样缠绕在一起。种植在欢迎园中的剩余头颅开始呱呱叫，呻吟，加入了这首可怕的歌曲。",
	"Through the mist that shrouds the smaller cavern, you see the parade of creatures responsible for the melody. Their bodies are only vaguely humanoid, with clusters of luminescent lichen and tumescent growths forming chaotic patterns on their decaying flesh, their voices stabbing into your minds, both insane and gleeful in equal parts:": "透过笼罩着小洞穴的迷雾，你看到了那些负责演奏旋律的生物队伍。他们的身体只是模糊的人形，一簇簇发光的地衣和膨胀的生长物在他们腐烂的肉体上形成混乱的图案，他们的声音刺入你的脑海，既疯狂又欣喜，不相上下。",
	"Zuggtmoy's thralls make their way to {@creature Yestabrod|OotA}'s garden, attacking only if the characters stand in their way.": "Zuggtmoy的王室成员向{@creature Yestabrod|OotA}的花园进发，只有当人物挡住他们的去路时才会发动攻击。",
	"If left alone, the thralls enact a mock wedding, with a chamberlain and a bridesmaid standing in for Araumycos and Zuggtmoy. {@creature Yestabrod|OotA}, if alive, assumes the role of priest to preside over the vows. If {@creature Yestabrod|OotA} is dead, three spore servants rise from the garden and carry its corpse, moving it like a puppet to play out the part of priest. At this point of the ceremony, any onlookers experience a vision.": "如果没有人管，王室成员会举行一场模拟婚礼，由一名内侍和一名伴娘代替Araumycos和Zuggtmoy。如果{@creature Yestabrod|OotA}还活着，他将扮演牧师的角色，主持宣誓仪式。如果(1%)死了，三个孢子仆人从花园里站起来，抬着它的尸体，像木偶一样移动它，扮演牧师的角色。在仪式的这一点上，任何围观者都会经历一个异象。",
	"The tableau of the mock wedding is replaced by a vision of the inside of a great tower. Spiraling stairs and balconies are carved into its walls, with the interior lit by phosphorescent patches of mold growing in whorls. In the center of the open space floats a humanoid figure, womanlike in form, but made entirely of fungi and mold. She is easily three times the height of the fungal bridesmaids that move up and down the spiraling stairs, tending to their giant mistress. They croon a strange, soothing song as they weave the substance of the giant figure into delicate lichen veils and a long, mycelium train like a bridal gown.": "模拟婚礼的场景被一座大塔内部的景象所取代。螺旋形的楼梯和阳台被雕刻在墙壁上，内部由轮状生长的霉菌的磷光斑点照明。在开放空间的中心，漂浮着一个人形，外形像女人，但完全由真菌和霉菌构成。她的身高是真菌伴娘的三倍，这些伴娘在螺旋形的楼梯上来回走动，照顾着她们巨大的女主人。她们一边唱着奇怪的、舒缓的歌曲，一边将巨人的身体织成精致的地衣和长长的、像新娘礼服一样的菌丝裙。",
	"If the characters share their experience with Basidia, the sovereign leads the two circles loyal to it out of Neverlight Grove before it is too late. Alternatively, the characters can follow the wedding procession into Yggmorgus and witness the further horrors waiting for the Underdark if Zuggtmoy rises in power.": "如果角色们与巴西迪亚分享他们的经验，君主就会在为时已晚之前带领忠于它的两个圈子离开永光丛林。或者，人物可以跟随婚礼队伍进入Yggmorgus，并目睹如果Zuggtmoy掌权，等待地下城的进一步恐怖。",
	"In addition to the XP gained for defeating Zuggtmoy's bridesmaids or chamberlains, each characters gains 100 XP for witnessing the wedding rehearsal.": "除了击败Zuggtmoy的伴娘或内侍所获得的XP之外，每个角色在见证婚礼排练时还能获得100个XP。",
	"When Zuggtmoy arrived in the Underdark, she was immediately drawn to Neverlight Grove and its fungal riches. She cultivated Yggmorgus, a mushroom of titanic proportions, from the rich, rotting soil.": "当Zuggtmoy来到暗黑世界时，她立刻被永光丛林和它的真菌财富所吸引。她从肥沃的腐烂土壤中培育出Yggmorgus，一种具有巨大比例的蘑菇。",
	"Conveniently secluded from the rest of the Underdark, Yggmorgus is a perfect base of operations for the Demon Queen of Fungi. She has completely enthralled Phylo, and the hapless sovereign is growing a myconid and spore servant army for her. Zuggtmoy has also become aware of Araumycos, the largest fungal life form—and possibly the largest creature of any kind—in the world. Araumycos is a vast fungus colony with a single mind, which fills the caverns and tunnels of the Underdark in an area the size of the High Forest. Araumycos is so interwoven with the fabric of the world that control of it would grant Zuggtmoy nearly unlimited power in her new home.": "Yggmorgus与暗黑世界的其他地方相隔甚远，是真菌恶魔女王的完美行动基地。她已经完全迷住了菲洛，而这位无能的君主正在为她培养一支菌类和孢子仆从军。Zuggtmoy也意识到了Araumycos，它是世界上最大的真菌生命体，而且可能是任何种类的最大生物。Araumycos是一个巨大的真菌群，它只有一个思想，充斥着地下世界的洞穴和隧道，面积相当于高级森林。Araumycos与世界的结构交织在一起，对它的控制将赋予Zuggtmoy在她的新家几乎无限的权力。",
	"Though Yggmorgus can't be seen clearly from the main cavern of Neverlight Grove, the unholy lights and sounds there can be discerned and sometimes even felt. Characters who ask the myconids about it receive mixed responses. Sovereign Phylo and those loyal to it enter a state of near bliss when they speak about Yggmorgus, as if it was a paradise. {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA} and its followers give wary answers. Phylo's secrecy means that they aren't sure what lies beyond the ravine.": "虽然从永光丛林的主洞中无法清楚地看到伊格摩格斯，但那里的邪恶之光和声音可以被辨别出来，有时甚至可以感觉到。向菌类问起它的人物得到了不同的回应。主权者菲洛和那些忠于它的人在谈到Yggmorgus时进入了一种近乎幸福的状态，仿佛它是一个天堂。{@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA}和它的追随者给出了警惕的回答。Phylo的保密性意味着他们不确定峡谷之外有什么。",
	"The cavern around Yggmorgus is huge, and the giant mushroom nearly fills it from floor to ceiling.": "Yggmorgus周围的洞穴是巨大的，巨大的蘑菇几乎从地板到天花板都充满了。",
	"You have no clear reference to judge the towering mushroom's size at this distance. Thousands of smaller fungi cling to the main stalk, which itself splits into several lesser stalks, each long enough with a cap big enough to be the top of a great tower. The cavern floor surrounding the stalk is covered by a carpet of fungi. An eerie luminescence pours through slitted windows carved into the trunk, with the same cacophony of atonal music heard earlier echoing within. A stench of rot and decay wraps around you, seemingly threatening to penetrate your flesh and pervade your soul.": "在这个距离上，你没有明确的参照物来判断这个高耸的蘑菇的大小。数以千计的较小的真菌附着在主茎上，主茎本身又分裂成几个较小的茎，每个茎都足够长，菌盖大到足以成为一座大塔的顶端。主茎周围的洞穴地面被真菌的地毯所覆盖。阴森恐怖的光亮透过刻在树干上的狭长窗口，与之前听到的无调音乐一样，在里面回荡。一股腐烂的臭味包裹着你，似乎要穿透你的肉体，弥漫你的灵魂。",
	"As if on cue, one of the lumps closest to the characters bubbles up and bursts. A dense cloud of spores and dark, reeking fluid explodes outward, even as the characters hear a piercing scream of agony and terror. Inside the pockmark left behind by the burst is one of Xinaya's drow scouts—or at least what's left of him. Other than a face, long white hair, and a breastplate, it is impossible to distinguish where the drow ends, and the rot and fungi consuming him begins. The drow feebly thrashes, his screams rising ever higher in pitch, until he locks eyes with one of the characters and abruptly stops screaming. A brief moment of lucidity replaces his terror, even as his eyes roll back into his head in some kind of bizarre euphoria as he goes limp and slowly sinks back down into the fungal muck. Characters witnessing this must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or gain one level of madness.": "仿佛是在提示，最靠近人物的一个肿块冒出了气泡并爆裂。一团密密麻麻的孢子和漆黑发臭的液体向外爆炸，甚至当角色们听到一声痛苦和恐怖的刺耳尖叫时。在爆裂留下的麻点内，是辛纳亚的一个乌鸦侦察员--或者至少是他的遗体。除了一张脸、长长的白发和一件胸甲之外，不可能分辨出哪里是乌鸦的终点，哪里是吞噬他的腐烂和真菌的起点。乌鸦无力地挣扎着，他的尖叫声越来越高，直到他与其中一个人物对视，突然停止了尖叫。短暂的清醒取代了他的恐惧，甚至他的眼睛在某种奇异的兴奋中滚回了他的脑袋，他瘫软下来，慢慢地沉入了真菌的泥沼中。目睹这一切的人物必须在DC13智慧救赎中成功，否则就会获得一级的疯狂。",
	"Throughout the entire cavern, loud moans and cries of agony answer the drow's screams in a terrifying and deafening chorus, drowning out all other sounds until eventually winding down into a low susurration of groans and burbles. The entire stalk of the giant mushroom seems to shudder, almost as if in delight.": "在整个洞穴里，响亮的呻吟声和痛苦的呼喊声在可怕的、震耳欲聋的合唱中回应着乌鸦的尖叫，淹没了所有其他的声音，直到最后渐渐变成低沉的呻吟和爆裂的声音。巨大的蘑菇的整个茎部似乎在颤抖，几乎像是在高兴。",
	"Characters who descend to the cavern's lower basin witness the next spectacle of unspeakable horror spawned by the Lady of Decay.": "下到洞穴下层盆地的角色见证了腐烂之女催生的下一个难以言喻的恐怖景象。",
	"Scores of deformed creatures dance around the base of the giant fungal tower. The revelers are a motley collection of humanoids and various other creatures, all sporting tumors, cankers, and putrid patches of flesh all over their bodies. They are joined by dancing fungi vaguely shaped and twisted into forms resembling humanoids. Some of these creatures are spore servants enthralled to the Demon Queen of Fungi. Others are myconids and other fungal life forms infested with Zuggtmoy's spores.": "几十个畸形的生物在巨大的真菌塔的底部跳舞。这些狂欢者是人形生物和其他各种生物的混合体，他们身上都长有肿瘤、溃疡和腐烂的肉块。他们与跳舞的真菌结合在一起，这些真菌的形状模糊不清，扭曲成类似于人形的形状。这些生物中有些是孢子的仆人，被真菌的恶魔女王迷住了。其他的则是霉菌和其他受祖格莫伊孢子侵袭的真菌生命形式。",
	"The dancing creatures pay no attention to trespassers unless they are attacked.

	"Voices can be heard cackling and chatting amiably about Sovereign Phylo's success at \"bringing so many new guests to attend the party!\" The characters see drow dancing as if their bones were melting, duergar roaring with mock merriment and vomiting slime, and even nothics laughing madly as they leap and caper.": "可以听到声音咯咯地笑着，和颜悦色地谈论着菲洛君主的成功，\"带来了这么多新的客人来参加聚会！\" 角色们看到鸦人在跳舞，仿佛他们的骨头都要融化了，杜尔加人嘲讽地咆哮并吐出粘液，甚至还有诺西人在跳跃和奔跑中疯狂地笑。",
	"Yggmorgus is the home that Zuggtmoy, the Demon Queen of Fungi, has carved for herself inside the great mushroom. The general layout is simple enough, with the hollowed stalk of the mushroom making a towering central hall in which Zuggtmoy floats, surrounded by spiraling balconies where her growing number of bridesmaids attend her, singing as they weave her bridal gown to prepare for the fateful wedding day.": "Yggmorgus是真菌妖后Zuggtmoy在大蘑菇里为自己建造的家。总体布局非常简单，蘑菇的空心柄构成了一个高耸的中央大厅，祖格莫伊在其中漂浮，周围是螺旋形的阳台，她越来越多的伴娘在那里陪伴她，一边唱歌一边为她编织新娘礼服，为决定命运的婚礼做准备。",
	"If the adventurers enter Yggmorgus, they come face to face with {@creature Zuggtmoy|MTF} (see {@adventure appendix D|OotA|20}), attended by twelve {@creature Bridesmaid of Zuggtmoy|OotA|bridesmaids of Zuggtmoy} (see {@adventure appendix C|OotA|19}). Fortunately for them, Zuggtmoy is deep in meditation as her gown and veil are being prepared. She doesn't move, although she can speak and use her other abilities. Her bridesmaids attempt to chase off intruders, wailing and scolding them about how it is unlucky for them to see the bride before it is time. If the characters don't withdraw immediately, Zuggtmoy awakens and uses her Mind Control Spores ability to send them away, using her Infestation Spores only if the characters insist on engaging the demon lord here and now.": "如果冒险者进入Yggmorgus，他们就会与{@creature Zuggtmoy|MTF}(见{@adventure appendix D|OotA|20})面对面，有12个{@creature Bridesmaid of Zuggtmoy|OotA|bridesmaids of Zuggtmoy}(见{@adventure appendix C|OotA|19})。幸运的是，在准备礼服和面纱的时候，祖格莫伊正沉浸在冥想中。她一动不动，尽管她可以说话并使用她的其他能力。她的伴娘们试图赶走入侵者，哀嚎着责骂他们，说他们在时间之前看到新娘是多么的不吉利。如果这些角色没有立即撤退，扎格莫伊就会醒来，并使用她的精神控制孢子能力将他们打发走，只有在这些角色坚持在这里和现在与恶魔领主交战的情况下才会使用她的感染孢子。",
	"Dozens of spore servants and myconids respond to Zuggtmoy's telepathic call if their mistress is in danger, attacking the characters heedless of their own safety. Any attack that successfully deals damage to Zuggtmoy damages her gown, driving the demon queen into a rage to attack the intruders.": "如果他们的女主人处于危险之中，几十个孢子仆人和菌类会对Zuggtmoy的心灵感应做出反应，攻击角色，而不顾他们自己的安全。任何成功地对扎格莫伊造成伤害的攻击都会破坏她的袍子，使恶魔女王陷入愤怒，攻击入侵者。",
	"Depending on how the characters interacted with the myconids and what tasks they accomplished for their hosts, they might depart in the company of a myconid guide, or even two whole circles of myconids fleeing the grove before Zuggtmoy's madness takes them. Sovereign Phylo doesn't stop the characters or {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA} from leaving, still convinced the cause it embraces is one of joy and prosperity for its people.": "根据人物与霉菌的互动情况以及他们为主人完成的任务，他们可能会在一个霉菌向导的陪伴下离开，甚至是在Zuggtmoy的疯狂带走他们之前，有两整圈的霉菌逃离丛林。主权者Phylo并没有阻止人物或{@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA}的离开，仍然相信它所拥护的事业是为其人民带来快乐和繁荣的。",
	"In all probability, the characters leave the fungal grove with dire and horrific news. They have witnessed the effect a single demon lord can have on the Material Plane—and they realize far more and worse things are coming.": "在所有的可能性中，角色们带着可怕的消息离开真菌丛林。他们已经目睹了一个恶魔领主对物质世界的影响--他们意识到更多更糟糕的事情即将发生。",
	"Regardless of how many battles the characters might have had inside Neverlight Grove, discovering that a demon lord is on the loose on the Material Plane is a major revelation. Moreover, if they were in Sloobludop to witness the rise of Demogorgon, they now know that more than one demon lord is at large, hinting at the magnitude of the threat.": "不管角色们在永光丛林里经历了多少次战斗，发现一个恶魔领主在物质世界里逍遥法外是一个重大的启示。此外，如果他们在斯洛布洛普见证了德摩根的崛起，他们现在知道不止一个恶魔领主在逃，暗示了威胁的严重性。",
	"If the adventurers simply passed through the grove and enjoyed the hospitality of the doomed myconids, they leave with only suspicions about their odd behavior, which can help them later in piecing together the greater mystery in the Underdark.": "如果冒险家们只是简单地穿过小树林，享受着注定失败的菌类的款待，那么他们离开时只能对它们的古怪行为产生怀疑，这可以帮助他们以后拼凑出地下城中更大的谜团。",
	"Blingdenstone, once called the City of Speaking Stones, is a deep gnome settlement founded more than two millennia ago. The deep gnomes, insular and secretive by nature, care little about histories and legacies, and thus most of the ruined city's past is lost to time.": "Blingdenstone，曾经被称为 \"会说话的石头之城\"，是两千多年前建立的深层地精定居点。深层地精，生性孤僻而神秘，对历史和遗产不屑一顾，因此，这座废墟城市的大部分过去都消失在时间中。",
	"For centuries, Blingdenstone remained hidden and isolated from the rest of the Underdark, thanks to a combination of misdirection and magic. It wasn't until they provided shelter to a drow exile named Drizzt Do'Urden that the deep gnomes began to take a more active interest in the world outside their caverns. Perceiving the threat the drow represented to all the peoples of the Underdark, the deep gnomes abandoned their isolation when they came to the defense of the dwarves of Mithral Hall, defeating an invading drow force from Menzoberranzan.": "几个世纪以来，由于误导和魔法的结合，布林登石一直隐藏起来，与暗黑世界的其他地方隔绝。直到他们为一个名叫德里兹-多乌登（Drizzt Do'Urden）的鸦人流亡者提供了庇护，深层地精才开始对他们洞穴外的世界产生了更积极的兴趣。当深层地精意识到鸦人对暗黑世界所有人民的威胁时，他们放弃了与世隔绝的状态，为米特拉尔厅的矮人提供了保护，击败了一支来自门索布兰赞的鸦人入侵部队。",
	"This alliance, however, would spell Blingdenstone's doom. The vengeful drow bided their time, rebuilt their forces, and sent their armies out to strike back hard against the svirfneblin, returning in great force to lay siege to Blingdenstone. The deep gnomes were no match for the drow army. Thousands of svirfneblin were slaughtered, and those survivors who didn't escape to Mithral Hall or the surface world were dragged back in chains to Menzoberranzan as slaves.": "然而，这个联盟将宣告布林登斯顿的灭亡。复仇的鸦人等待时机，重建他们的部队，并派出他们的军队对svirfneblin进行猛烈的反击，以巨大的力量返回，围攻Blingdenstone。深海地精们不是鸦人军队的对手。数以千计的svirfneblin被屠杀，而那些没有逃到Mithral Hall或地表世界的幸存者则被锁链拖回Menzoberranzan作为奴隶。",
	"Within the past decade or so, the deep gnomes have returned to reclaim, resettle, and rebuild their city. The ultimate success of their efforts, however, hangs by a slender thread. Most of the ruined city is a dangerous place and remains closed off, with tunnels and chambers barricaded with gates or deliberately caused cave-ins. The svirfneblin must contend with incursions by wererat squatters, insane elementals, ghosts, and a plague of invading oozes controlled by {@creature the Pudding King|OotA}—a mad deep gnome under the influence of the demon lord Juiblex. Before they can offer the party any help, the deep gnomes likely need some themselves.": "在过去十年左右的时间里，深山地精们回到了这里，收回、重新安置并重建他们的城市。然而，他们的努力最终能否成功，还取决于一个细微的问题。废墟上的大部分地方都很危险，仍然被封闭着，隧道和房间都被门挡住，或者故意造成洞穴。svirfneblin必须应对wererat squatters、疯狂的元素、鬼魂的入侵，以及由{@creature the Pudding King|OotA}--一个受恶魔领主Juiblex影响的疯狂的深层地精--控制的入侵ozes瘟疫。在他们能够为党提供任何帮助之前，深层地精很可能自己也需要一些帮助。",
	"Blingdenstone is an obvious destination for characters seeking refuge from their drow pursuers and a way out of the Underdark. The deep gnomes continue to have regular dealings with the surface world.": "Blingdenstone是一个明显的目的地，可以让那些寻求庇护、躲避乌鸦追捕者和离开暗黑世界的角色。深海地精继续与地面世界保持着定期的交易。",
	"The svirfneblin settlement is a haven for the characters. For good reason, the deep gnomes rarely allow drow into Blingdenstone, and only then with a heavily armed escort. A drow character must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check to enter escorted. However, if any deep gnomes are traveling with the party, having them vouch for the drow allows the escort to be waived at your discretion.": "svirfneblin定居点是这些人物的天堂。出于充分的理由，深山地精们很少允许乌鸦进入布林登斯通，而且只有在全副武装的护卫下才允许。鸦人角色必须在DC15魅力({@skill Persuasion})检查中成功，才能在护送下进入。然而，如果有任何深层地精与队伍同行，让他们为乌鸦担保，就可以根据你的决定放弃护送。",
	"Blingdenstone has a reputation for being a dangerous ruin inhabited only by monsters and other undesirables. Others think of it as a budding settlement well on its way to recovery. Once the characters reach the gates, they can see that the truth lies somewhere in between.": "Blingdenstone的名声是一个危险的废墟，只有怪物和其他不受欢迎的人居住在这里。其他人则认为它是一个正在萌芽的定居点，正在走向复兴。一旦人物到达大门，他们就会发现，真相就在两者之间。",
	"The characters must prove their goodwill to the deep gnomes before they are allowed inside. Once the characters win the gnomes' trust, they are welcomed into Inner Blingdenstone, and to what food and comfort the locals can readily provide.": "在被允许进入之前，角色们必须向深处的地精们证明他们的善意。一旦人物赢得了地精的信任，他们就会被欢迎进入内布林登斯通，并获得当地人可以随时提供的食物和安慰。",
	"Deep gnomes are a dour lot, reserved and careful in their dealings with outsiders. They make the assumption that every non-svirfneblin means to do them harm—which is understandable given their history. They speak softly in caves and tunnels where sound carries, eyes darting furtively, looking for signs of danger.": "深海地精是一个沉闷的群体，在与外人打交道时，他们保留并谨慎行事。他们假设每一个非精灵族人都想伤害他们--鉴于他们的历史，这一点是可以理解的。他们在有声音的洞穴和隧道里轻声说话，眼睛鬼鬼祟祟地闪动着，寻找危险的迹象。",
	"Despite their harsh outlook, svirfneblin are still gnomes, and many are as benevolent and joyful as their surface cousins. They reveal these aspects most easily among their own kind, and to those they come to trust.": "尽管前景严峻，但svirfneblin仍然是地精，而且许多人和他们的表亲一样仁慈和快乐。他们在自己的同类中，以及在他们信任的人面前，最容易透露出这些方面。",
	"The svirfneblin assign defined roles to each gender but hold females and males in equal standing. It is ancient custom for there to be both a king and a queen with equal responsibilities. Svirfneblin males are hunters, explorers, laborers, and warriors, while females are managers, judges, politicians, and caretakers. Deep gnomes sometimes forget this is not the case with other races, and that males are capable of careful thought just as much as females can fight.": "svirfneblin人给每个性别分配了明确的角色，但认为女性和男性地位平等。古老的习俗是有一个国王和一个王后，负有同等责任。Svirfneblin的男性是猎人、探险家、劳动者和战士，而女性是管理者、法官、政治家和看护人。深度地精有时会忘记其他种族的情况并非如此，男性能够仔细思考，就像女性能够战斗一样。",
	"The general attitude of deep gnomes toward strangers is hostile—not necessarily opposed, but deeply suspicious. This attitude can be shifted to indifferent and then friendly as the characters help the svirfneblin openly (see \"{@book Social Interaction|DMG|8|Social Interaction}\" in chapter 8 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}).": "深山地精对陌生人的一般态度是敌对的--不一定是反对，而是深深地怀疑。这种态度可以转变为冷漠，然后随着人物公开帮助svirfneblin而变得友好（见《{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}》第八章中的\"{@book Social Interaction|DMG|8|Social Interaction}\"）。",

	"The svirfneblin use these beasts as part of their digging workforce. {@creature Cave Badger|OotA|Cave badgers} are giant badgers with AC 12 (natural armor), {@sense tremorsense} out to a range of 60 feet, and a burrowing speed of 15 feet. When they burrow, they leave tunnels behind them.": "svirfneblin使用这些野兽作为他们挖掘工作的一部分。{@creature Cave Badger|OotA|Cave badgers}是巨型獾，AC值为12（自然护甲），{@sense tremorsense}范围为60英尺，钻洞速度为15英尺。当它们钻洞时，它们会在身后留下隧道。",

	"By deep gnome tradition, Blingdenstone is governed jointly by a king and queen, but the svirfneblin have had no true sovereigns while living as refugees for the good part of a century. Dorbo and Senni Diggermattock are talented miners, but they have become even more capable as community leaders. They spent years planning an expedition to Blingdenstone, paying adventurers to scout and keep an eye on the territory while they organized their people across the dwarven holds and surface-world cities that had received them.": "根据地精的传统，布林登斯通由国王和王后共同管理，但在一个世纪的时间里，svirfneblin人在作为难民生活时没有真正的统治者。Dorbo和Senni Diggermattock是有天赋的矿工，但他们作为社区领袖变得更有能力。他们花了数年时间计划远征布林登斯通，付钱给冒险者侦察和监视该地区，同时他们在接收他们的矮人领地和地表世界的城市中组织他们的人民。",

There are far more ghosts in the ruined settlement than anyone expected, and each ghost is different. Some are harmless, appearing only as echoes of the event that led to their deaths. Others are fully aware—and often hostile and dangerous.": "虽然没有真正的组织，但在乌鸦袭击中被杀的斯维尔纳布林的鬼魂是一个不可否认的存在。定居者们很明智地将闹鬼的洞穴从他们的开垦计划中标记出来。但随着新的svirfneblin的到来并需要住宿，空间开始成为一个问题。废墟上的鬼魂比任何人都要多，而且每个鬼魂都是不同的。有些是无害的，只是作为导致他们死亡的事件的回声出现。其他的则是完全有意识的，而且往往是敌对的和危险的。",

Chipgrin is all too aware of the threat posed by Ogrémoch's Bane and the oozes plaguing the settlement, and he hopes that making common cause against those threats will force the other svirfneblin to recognize Clan Goldwhisker's right to remain in Blingdenstone.": "今天，深层地精狼人以Goldwhisker氏族的名义宣称拥有废墟的一大部分，对新的定居者占有领土，并对他们进行城市战争。狼群的领袖是狡猾而富有魅力的奇普林，他对狼群安全的关注使他希望与迪格马托克人谈判达成休战协议，并阻止他的斯维尔芬布林表亲将他的族人视为只适合灭绝的危险怪物。Chipgrin非常清楚Ogrémoch的Bane和困扰定居点的ozes所带来的威胁，他希望通过共同对抗这些威胁来迫使其他svirfneblin承认Goldwhisker家族留在Blingdenstone的权利。",
	"The so-called Pudding King holds court in the deepest sections of Blingdenstone. He was part of the first settler mission led by the Diggermattocks, but the other svirfneblin soon shunned him for his many disturbing habits, among them his preoccupation with capturing and studying oozes, and his penchant for stealing and hoarding food until it rotted... and then talking to it.": "所谓的布丁王在布林登斯顿的最深处开庭。他是迪格马托克人带领的第一个移民任务的一部分，但其他斯维尔内布林人很快就避开了他，因为他有许多令人不安的习惯，其中包括他专注于捕捉和研究奥兹，以及他喜欢偷窃和囤积食物，直到食物腐烂...然后对它说话。",
	"Juiblex granted {@creature the Pudding King|OotA} the power to summon and command oozes, then ordered him to return to Blingdenstone and claim it as part of the Faceless Lord's new domain. {@creature The Pudding King|OotA} slipped back into the closed-off areas of Blingdenstone and set up court, summoning all manner of oozes along the way and rendering portions of the ruined city uninhabitable and dangerous to outsiders.": "Juiblex授予{@creature the Pudding King|OotA}召唤和指挥ozes的能力，然后命令他回到Blingdenstone，将其作为无面者领主的新领域的一部分。(1%)溜回了布林登斯顿的封闭区域并建立了法庭，沿途召唤了各种形式的ozes，并使废墟城市的部分地区变得不适合居住，对外人来说很危险。",
	"Utterly insane and channeling a terrible power, {@creature the Pudding King|OotA} sits upon his throne with his \"children\" at his side, summoning ever more loyal subjects with each passing day. When he is ready, he will send them forth to cover and devour everything, transforming Blingdenstone and its people into one giant mound of slime and goo formed in the image of his master, the Faceless Lord.": "他完全疯了，并引导着一种可怕的力量，{@creature the Pudding King|OotA}坐在他的宝座上，身边是他的 \"孩子们\"，每天都在召唤着更多忠诚的臣民。当他准备好了，他将派他们去覆盖和吞噬一切，把布林登石和它的人民变成一个巨大的粘液和粘液的土堆，形成他的主人，无面神的形象。",
	"The quarries, mines, mushroom fields, and forges of Blingdenstone are located outside the settlement, accessible by tunnels and passages beyond the main gate. Trade caravans headed toward Blingdenstone are either re-routed to the outlying mines, farms, and forges, or they are stopped at the city gate, where their cargo is searched, unloaded, and distributed by agents of Quartermaster Senni. This keeps unwanted riffraff out of the city proper and protects Blingdenstone's security.": "Blingdenstone的采石场、矿场、蘑菇田和锻造厂都位于定居点之外，可以通过正门之外的隧道和通道进入。前往布林登斯顿的贸易商队要么改道前往外围的矿场、农场和锻造厂，要么被拦在城门外，由军需官森尼的代理人对货物进行搜查、卸货和分配。这使得不受欢迎的流氓无法进入城市，并保护了布林登斯顿的安全。",
	"The deep gnomes working in the mines, farms, and forges outside the settlement spend less time enjoying the leisure and company of their kin and friends back home. The rising madness of the demon lords affects these brave pioneers more than those who live within the relative security of the reclaimed parts of Blingdenstone.": "在定居点外的矿场、农场和锻造厂工作的深层地精们花在享受休闲和陪伴家乡亲戚朋友的时间较少。与那些生活在布林登斯通开垦区相对安全的人相比，恶魔领主的疯狂崛起对这些勇敢的先驱者影响更大。",
	"Svirfneblin in the outskirts are more curt with strangers, and a few might even try to steal from them. Taskmasters at each location are now feeling themselves driven to the point of near tyranny, demanding that their workers toil ever harder. Some miners pocket gemstones they dig out, while others are drawn to possess things the adventurers are carrying.": "郊区的Svirfneblin对陌生人比较客气，有几个甚至会试图从他们那里偷东西。每个地方的任务负责人现在都觉得自己被逼到了近乎暴政的地步，要求他们的工人更加努力工作。一些矿工把挖出的宝石装进口袋，而另一些人则被冒险者携带的东西所吸引。",
	"If the gelatinous cube {@creature Glabbagool|OotA} travels with the party (see {@adventure chapter 4|OotA|3}), its presence poses a few challenges in Blingdenstone. The recent ooze attacks have the deep gnomes rattled, and an intelligent, telepathic gelatinous cube is something beyond their understanding. The characters have to convince the svirfneblin to allow their unusual companion inside, or tell it to remain outside the settlement. If left outside, {@creature Glabbagool|OotA} might eventually find its way in through the wererat warrens, giving the characters insight into how the other oozes are getting in, or appearing in the nick of time to help the characters if they find themselves in peril.": "如果胶质方块{@creature Glabbagool|OotA}与队伍同行（见{@adventure chapter 4|OotA|3}），它的出现会给布林登石镇带来一些挑战。最近的渗出物攻击让深层地精们惊慌失措，而一个智能的、有心灵感应的胶状立方体是他们无法理解的。角色们必须说服svirfneblin允许他们不寻常的伙伴进入，或者告诉它留在定居点之外。如果留在外面，(2%)可能最终会通过wererat warrens找到它，让角色了解其他ozes是如何进来的，或者在角色发现自己处于危险中时及时出现，帮助他们。",
	"This large cavern is located west of Blingdenstone (see the map of Underdark regions and locations in {@area chapter 2|051|x}) and has always been a closely guarded secret. Most svirfneblin who knew of it perished during the drow invasion of Blingdenstone. A few members of the Stoneheart Enclave have heard of its existence, but have either dismissed it as legend or have simply been too preoccupied with the reclaiming and rebuilding of Blingdenstone to search for it.": "这个大洞穴位于Blingdenstone的西部（见{@area chapter 2|051|x}中的暗黑区域和地点地图），一直以来都是一个被严密保护的秘密。大多数知道它的svirfneblin在鸦人入侵Blingdenstone的过程中丧生。石心飞地的少数成员听说过它的存在，但要么将其视为传说，要么只是忙于收回和重建布林登斯通而无暇去寻找它。",
	"The cave is two days' walk of the settlement, its entrance a small tunnel leading to a ledge high above the cavern floor. The cave is lined with stalagmites and stalactites, but the dominant feature is the summoning circle at its center. The circle was once used by the svirfneblin to summon Entémoch, a prince of elemental earth, and his energies suffused the entire cavern, empowering elemental summoning within its confines.": "这个洞穴离定居点有两天的路程，它的入口是一条小隧道，通向洞穴地面上的一个高台。洞内有许多石笋和钟乳石，但最主要的特征是洞中心的召唤圈。这个圆圈曾经被斯维尔纳布林用来召唤恩特莫赫，一个土元素的王子，他的能量充斥着整个洞穴，使其范围内的元素召唤得到加强。",
	"If the circle is used to cast a spell that summons an earth elemental, the spell's duration becomes {@dice 1d4 + 6} days and the spell requires no concentration. The summoned elemental never becomes hostile toward the spell's caster or its companions. To gain these benefits, the caster must provide material components in the form of gems with a total value of 10 gp per Hit Die of the elemental summoned.": "如果这个圆圈被用来施展召唤土元素的咒语，那么咒语的持续时间会变成{@dice 1d4 + 6}天，并且咒语不需要集中。被召唤的元素不会对施法者或其同伴产生敌意。为了获得这些好处，施法者必须以宝石的形式提供物质成分，总价值为被召唤元素的每一个命中率10GP。",
	"Finding Entémoch's Boon allows the characters to make a check to improve the attitude of the deep gnomes (see \"Changing Svirfneblin Attitudes\").": "找到Entémoch's Boon后，人物可以进行检查，以改善深山地精的态度（见 \"改变Svirfneblin的态度\"）。",
	"For each day of exploration, check for random encounters using the tables in {@area chapter 2|07f|x} and adjust the drow pursuit level as necessary.": "在每一天的探索中，使用{@area chapter 2|07f|x}中的表格检查随机遇到的情况，并根据需要调整乌鸦的追求水平。",
	"Once the basilisks are defeated, characters can resume their exploration of the cave and find three basilisk eggs in a nest made of pulverized stone. Each egg is a 6-inch-diameter, 20-pound sphere with a pebbled-gray shell as hard as stone. Left alone, the eggs hatch in {@dice 1d4 + 1} months. An {@creature infant basilisk|OotA} that emerges imprints on the first creature it sees. It thereafter follows that creature around like its parent, demanding to be fed. If the characters manage to keep the basilisk alive, it reaches adulthood after twelve months. Track its growth using the Basilisk Maturation table.": "一旦击败了罗勒鱼，角色们就可以继续探索洞穴，并在一个由粉碎的石头制成的巢穴中找到三个罗勒鱼蛋。每个蛋都是一个直径6英寸、重达20磅的球体，其卵石灰色的外壳像石头一样坚硬。独自一人，这些蛋在{@dice 1d4 + 1}个月内孵化。孵化出来的(1%)会在它看到的第一个生物上留下印记。此后，它就像它的父母一样跟着那个生物走，要求被喂养。如果人物设法让巴斯里斯克活着，它将在12个月后达到成年。使用巴斯里斯克成熟度表追踪它的成长。",

	"Whiteshell Mine is an interconnected network of small caverns dug into the vast salt veins lining this area of the Underdark.

	"By the time they reach this point, the characters should be at least 7th level, having overcome countless challenges in their wild and dangerous journey through the locations described in chapters 1 through 6.

	"Escaping the Underdark is no simple matter. Characters who try to find their own way out might wander for years without stumbling upon the right series of passages to take them to the surface. As the DM, you determine where and when they find the way out. The characters can visit the places described in chapters 3 through 6, using the interconnecting material in chapters 2 and 3, in virtually any order. This makes it problematic to put the way to the surface world in a particular place, since the adventurers could just as easily bypass it as stumble upon it prematurely. Instead, the characters' escape is made possible by a set of conditions that you can implement when the time is right.": "逃离地下城不是一件简单的事情。试图自己寻找出路的角色可能会徘徊数年而无法偶然发现一系列正确的通道将他们带到地面。作为DM，你要决定他们在哪里以及何时找到出路。角色们可以使用第2章和第3章中相互关联的材料，以几乎任何顺序访问第3章到第6章中描述的地方。这样一来，把通往地表世界的路放在一个特定的地方就成了问题，因为冒险者可以很容易地绕过它，也可以过早地偶然发现它。取而代之的是，人物的逃亡是通过一系列的条件来实现的，你可以在适当的时候实施。",
	"The deep gnome settlement (see {@adventure chapter 6|OotA|5}) has the most dealings with the surface world of any community in this region of the Underdark, and the adventurers can find the resources there to guide them out.

	"Since Blingdenstone is the most obvious and reliable location from which to find a way out of the Underdark, you might want to steer the campaign to other locations first. This can be done by treating the other chapters as side adventures to the characters' main journey, with many of those side adventures focused on the characters helping their NPC companions return to their homes in the Underdark.": "由于布林登石是找到离开暗黑世界的最明显和最可靠的地点，你可能想先把活动引向其他地方。这可以通过将其他章节视为角色主要旅程的副线冒险来实现，其中许多副线冒险的重点是角色帮助他们的NPC同伴返回暗黑世界的家园。",
	"Various other tunnels and passages wend their way to the surface in places around the Evermoors or even more remote locations. You can place these wherever you like, if an opportune time for the characters to depart comes along before exploring any of the previous options.": "其他各种隧道和通道在Evermoors周围的地方甚至更偏远的地方蜿蜒通向地面。你可以把这些东西放在你喜欢的地方，如果在探索之前有一个合适的时间让人物离开的话。",
	"A number of ancient portals can be found in the Underdark. A functional portal is a magical doorway leading to some other specific location in Faerûn. If the characters' choices during the adventure leave them unable to secure escape with the help of the NPCs they meet, you could place a portal in or near one of the locations explored in chapters 2 through 6. If the portal is damaged, the characters might need to repair it. The characters also need to figure out how to activate the portal, or find the key or spell necessary to activate it. A portal can be one-way only and send the adventurers anywhere you want.": "在暗黑世界中可以找到许多古老的传送门。一个实用的传送门是一个通往法鲁恩其他特定地点的魔法门道。如果角色在冒险过程中的选择使他们无法在遇到的NPC的帮助下确保逃脱，你可以在第二章到第六章中探索的某个地点或附近放置一个传送门。如果传送门被损坏了，角色们可能需要修复它。人物还需要弄清楚如何激活传送门，或者找到激活传送门所需的钥匙或咒语。传送门可以是单向的，可以把冒险者送到你想要的任何地方。",
	"By the time they have visited the locations detailed in the previous chapters, the characters should have knowledge of a route to the surface world and a map or guide to help them navigate it. These two goals should serve as tools to help motivate the players throughout the earlier chapters of the adventure. As a reward in one chapter, the characters might learn of the existence of a potential route out, leading them to another location in the Underdark where it is supposed to be. Then they need to find a map or guide for the potential route, which could involve them in what is happening in the new location. To complicate the search, they might then discover that a route or guide isn't all they had hoped for, but instead leads them to more promising options.": "当他们访问了前几章详述的地点时，角色们应该知道通往地表世界的路线，并有地图或指南来帮助他们导航。这两个目标应该作为工具，在冒险的前几章帮助激励玩家。作为某一章的奖励，角色们可能会了解到一条潜在的外出路线的存在，将他们引向暗黑世界中另一个应该存在的地点。然后他们需要找到潜在路线的地图或指南，这可能会让他们参与到新地点所发生的事情中。让搜索更复杂的是，他们可能会发现一条路线或指南并不是他们所希望的全部，而是将他们引向更有希望的选择。",
	"As an example, the characters might hear of a potential route to the surface from Gracklstugh. They go to the duergar city and become embroiled in events unfolding there, only to be denied access by the gray dwarves. However, meeting a group of wandering myconids in the city reveals that the myconids of Neverlight Grove know a great deal about the hidden ways of the Underdark.": "举例来说，角色们可能听说了一条从格拉克斯图格（Gracklstugh）通往地表的潜在路线。他们去了duergar城，并卷入了那里发生的事件中，但却被灰矮人拒绝了进入。然而，在城市中遇到一群流浪的菌类，发现永光丛林的菌类对暗黑世界的隐秘方式了解甚多。",
	"Clues and leads should become more plentiful and substantial as the characters approach 7th level, leading them toward their eventual escape route—and with many adventures and encounters happening along the way. If you hand out these hints and opportunities carefully, the characters' path through the Underdark should feel like a smoothly escalating series of discoveries, no matter what order they chose to explore the locations and deal with the challenges of the previous chapters.": "当人物接近第7层时，线索应该变得更加丰富和充实，引导他们走向最终的逃跑路线--而且一路上会有许多冒险和遭遇。如果你小心翼翼地发放这些提示和机会，那么无论他们选择什么样的顺序来探索这些地点和应对前面章节的挑战，角色们在地下城的道路上都应该感觉是一连串顺利升级的发现。",
	"When the characters finally reach the surface, it's likely that some of their subterranean companions will choose to remain in the Underdark rather than face the perils of the surface world.": "当人物最终到达地面时，他们的一些地下同伴很可能会选择留在地下世界而不是面对地面世界的危险。",
	"Knowing that many of their NPC companions have homes in the Underdark can be an important part of the decision-making process that guides the characters through the early chapters of this adventure. The Underdark is a dangerous place, and characters might be reluctant to let their newfound friends fend for themselves. Helping some of them return home makes a good incentive to visit locations in the Underdark. Shuushar, {@creature Topsy|OotA}, {@creature Turvy|OotA}, {@creature Stool|OotA}, {@creature Rumpadump|OotA}, and {@creature Glabbagool|OotA} would rather remain in the Underdark than suffer sunlight.": "知道他们的许多NPC同伴在暗黑世界有家，可以成为指导角色完成冒险早期章节的决策过程的一个重要部分。暗黑世界是一个危险的地方，角色们可能不愿意让他们新发现的朋友自生自灭。帮助他们中的一些人回家是一个很好的激励机制，可以让他们访问地下城的各个地点。舒沙、{@creature Topsy|OotA}、{@creature Turvy|OotA}、{@creature Stool|OotA}、{@creature Rumpadump|OotA}和{@creature Glabbagool|OotA}宁愿留在暗黑世界也不愿意遭受阳光的照射。",
	"Companions such as Eldeth and {@creature Ront|OotA}, who prefer to live on or near the surface, gladly follow the characters all the way out if they can. Eldeth wishes to return to Gauntlgrym, and her presence there can provide a connection for the characters when they visit the dwarven settlement in {@adventure chapter 8|OotA|7}. If Eldeth didn't survive, she might have charged the characters with returning her body or effects to Gauntlgrym. {@creature Ront|OotA} might wish to rejoin his tribe or seek a new home elsewhere, based on how the events in the earlier chapters of the adventure have influenced him. Depending on how he was treated, the orc most likely parts from the characters in peace—out of respect for their battle prowess, if nothing else.": "像Eldeth和{@creature Ront|OotA}这样的同伴，他们喜欢生活在地表或附近，如果可以的话，他们很乐意一直跟着人物走。Eldeth希望回到Gauntlgrym，当人物访问{@adventure chapter 8|OotA|7}的矮人定居点时，她在那里的存在可以为他们提供一种联系。如果Eldeth没能活下来，她可能会责成人物把她的身体或影响送回Gauntlgrym。{@creature Ront|OotA}可能希望重新加入他的部落，或者在其他地方寻找新的家园，这取决于冒险的前几章中的事件对他的影响。根据他受到的待遇，这个兽人最有可能在和平中离开角色--如果没有其他原因的话，是对他们的战斗力的尊重。",
	"{@creature Buppido|OotA}, {@creature Prince Derendil|OotA}, and Sarith might be gone well before the adventurers are ready to return to the surface, having already revealed their dark secrets and treacherous natures.": "{@creature Buppido|OotA}、{@creature Prince Derendil|OotA}和萨利斯可能在冒险者准备返回地面之前就已经离开了，他们已经暴露了自己的黑暗秘密和奸诈的本性。",
	"If {@creature Buppido|OotA} or Sarith are still around, either NPC could go mad and attempt to kill the adventurers before they reach the surface world. Derendil might still hold to his delusion of being an elf prince wanting to return to his forest kingdom. However, the quaggoth is poorly suited to travel on the surface, needing shelter from the light during the day. He becomes increasingly irrational and erratic, seeing enemies and plots everywhere, until he eventually accuses the characters of colluding with his enemies and attacks in a mad fury.": "如果{@creature Buppido|OotA}或萨利斯还在，任何一个NPC都可能发疯，试图在冒险者到达地表世界之前杀死他们。德兰迪尔可能仍然坚持他的妄想，认为自己是一个精灵王子，想要回到他的森林王国。然而，这只夸父并不适合在地面上旅行，他需要在白天躲避光线。他变得越来越不理智和反复无常，看到到处都是敌人和阴谋，直到他最终指责人物与他的敌人勾结，并在疯狂的愤怒中攻击。",
	"The drow from Velkynvelve have pursued their escaped prisoners throughout the first half of the adventure. Along the way, they might have engaged the characters in combat or set up a number of near-miss encounters. At times, the adventurers might have believed they had shaken off their pursuers for good, only to have the drow show up unexpectedly. The characters' departure from the Underdark offers the final opportunity for them to confront their pursuers and settle the score.": "Velkynvelve的乌鸦在整个冒险的前半部分都在追捕他们逃跑的囚犯。一路上，他们可能会与人物交战，或者安排一些差点被打倒的遭遇。有时，冒险者们可能认为他们已经永远甩掉了追兵，但鸦人却意外地出现了。角色们离开暗黑世界为他们提供了最后的机会，让他们与追捕者对峙并解决这个问题。",
	"The possibility that her prey might escape drives Ilvara onward. In turn, she relentlessly pushes those under her command to redouble their efforts to catch the characters. At this point, the pursuit level tracking set out in {@area chapter 2|078|x} is no longer relevant. Ilvara and her warriors catch up to the adventurers just before they reach the uppermost level of the Underdark. The adventurers can choose to lead the drow on a risky chase, or stand and fight.": "她的猎物可能逃脱的可能性促使伊尔瓦拉继续前进。反过来，她无情地推动她手下的人加倍努力去抓捕这些人物。在这一点上，{@area chapter 2|078|x}中设定的追击水平追踪已经不再重要。伊尔瓦拉和她的战士们在冒险家们到达地下城最上层之前追上了他们。冒险家们可以选择带领乌鸦进行冒险的追击，或者站着战斗。",
	"Each participant in the chase rolls a {@dice d20} at the end of its turn and consults the Drow Chase Complications table. The result (if any) affects the next chase participant in initiative order.": "每个参与追逐的人在其回合结束时都会掷出一个{@dice d20}，并查阅鸦人追逐并发症表。其结果（如果有的话）会影响到下一个追击者的主动权顺序。",
	"If you want to extend the chase, the drow could pursue the characters onto the surface, which places them at a disadvantage once the sun comes up (see \"Evening the Odds\").": "如果你想延长追逐的时间，乌鸦可以追到地面上，这样一来，一旦太阳升起，他们就会处于不利地位（见 \"平均赔率\"）。",
	"If the drow catch up with the characters, the chase becomes a combat (see \"Stand and Fight\").": "如果乌鸦追上了角色，追逐就会变成一场战斗（见 \"站立和战斗\"）。",
	"If the characters stand and fight, or if the drow catch them, they're in for a tough battle. Ilvara alone is a challenge for a group of 8th-level characters, and she is accompanied by her most powerful servants. The attacking drow force consists of the following:": "如果角色们站着战斗，或者被乌鸦抓住，他们将面临一场恶战。伊尔瓦拉一个人对一群8级角色来说是个挑战，而她身边还有她最强大的仆人。进攻的乌鸦部队由以下人员组成。",

	"On her first turn in combat, Ilvara casts {@spell conjure animals} to summon two {@creature Giant Spider||giant spiders} to fight alongside the drow, while Asha casts {@spell spirit guardians} on herself and concentrates to maintain it. The other drow cast {@spell darkness} to hinder ranged attackers before closing to melee. Shoor protects Ilvara, while Jorlan makes no effort to protect his fellow drow. Ilvara prefers to strike from a distance with her {@item tentacle rod}, or cast spells such as {@spell poison spray} and{@spell ray of sickness}.": "在战斗的第一个回合，伊尔瓦拉施放{@spell conjure animals}召唤两个{@creature Giant Spider||giant spiders}与乌鸦并肩作战，而阿莎对自己施放{@spell spirit guardians}并集中精力维持。其他的乌鸦施展{@spell darkness}来阻碍远程攻击者，然后再靠近近战。肖尔保护伊尔瓦拉，而乔兰则没有努力保护他的同伴。伊尔瓦拉更喜欢用她的{@item tentacle rod}从远处攻击，或者施展{@spell poison spray}和{@spell ray of sickness}等法术。",
	"The characters might have a couple NPC companions around to help them defeat the drow (see \"Bidding Farewell\"), but if they need more assistance, consider the following options:": "角色们可能有几个NPC同伴在身边帮助他们打败乌鸦（见 \"告别\"），但如果他们需要更多的帮助，可以考虑以下方案。",

	"Asha chooses the confusion of combat as the moment to betray Ilvara, attacking while the elder priestess's back is turned. Ilvara instantly turns her attention to eliminating the traitor, distracting her and weakening the drow side if she succeeds.": "阿莎选择了战斗的混乱作为背叛伊尔瓦拉的时机，在长老女祭司背对着她的时候进行攻击。伊尔瓦拉立刻将注意力转移到消灭叛徒上，如果她成功了，就能分散她的注意力并削弱鸦人一方。",

	"Once they reach the surface, the characters must still travel some distance to reach civilization. Most of the tunnels that connect to the Underdark in this region lie in or near the Evermoors or the Lurkwood—wild regions filled with ruins and monsters. You can choose to narrate as much of the party's overland travel as you wish, setting up encounters en route.

	"After their escape from the Underdark in chapter 7, the adventurers have time to rest, recuperate, and reorient themselves back in the surface world from which they were taken. Some three months after their return, they receive a summons to the dwarf kingdom of Gauntlgrym in the North. King Bruenor Battlehammer desires an audience with them regarding their experiences in the Underdark. Representatives of several factions with an interest in what is happening in the Underdark will also be in attendance. Following the audience, Bruenor extends an offer to the characters, who are tasked with returning to the Underdark once more on a perilous mission.": "在第七章逃离暗黑世界后，冒险者们有时间休息、休整，并重新定位他们所处的地面世界。在他们回来的三个月后，他们收到了前往北方的矮人王国Gauntlgrym的传票。布鲁诺-战锤（Bruenor Battlehammer）国王希望就他们在暗黑世界的经历与他们会面。对暗黑世界所发生的事情感兴趣的几个派别的代表也将出席会议。觐见之后，布鲁诺向这些人物提出了一个提议，他们的任务是再次回到暗黑世界，执行一项危险的任务。",

See \"Gauntlgrym Connections.\") King Bruenor's summons reaches the characters by whatever method best suits the story, depending on where they go and what they are doing following their return to the surface world. It can be in the form of a messenger carrying a handwritten letter bearing the king's seal, or even an {@spell animal messenger} or {@spell sending} spell focused on one or more of the adventurers. Regardless of how it gets to them, the message is simple and clear:": "布鲁诺国王从最近从暗黑世界回来的矮人商人和信使那里得知了这些人物的事迹。(如果{@creature Eldeth Feldrun|OotA}是冒险者成功逃脱并安全返回Gauntlgrym的一部分，队伍的英雄事迹通过她传到了Bruenor。参见 \"Gauntlgrym的联系\"）。布鲁诺国王的召唤以任何最适合故事的方式到达人物手中，这取决于他们回到地面世界后的去处和所做的事情。它的形式可以是信使携带带有国王印章的手写信件，或者甚至是针对一个或多个冒险者的{@spell animal messenger}或{@spell sending}咒语。无论它如何到达他们手中，信息都是简单而明确的。",
	"Characters belonging to any of the factions involved in the meeting at Gauntlgrym (see \"Forging an Alliance\") might receive a summons from their faction as well, and could even travel with the representative of that faction to the dwarf hold if circumstances permit. Otherwise, the choice to make the journey is up to the characters, although ignoring Bruenor's request leads the dwarf king to send ever more insistent messages.": "属于Gauntlgrym会议（见 \"建立联盟\"）的任何一个派别的角色可能也会收到他们派别的召唤，如果情况允许，甚至可以和该派别的代表一起前往矮人的领地。否则，是否出行由角色决定，尽管无视布鲁诺的要求会导致矮人国王发出更多坚持的信息。",
	"If {@creature Eldeth Feldrun|OotA} survived and escaped from the Underdark with the characters, she is eager to return home to Gauntlgrym, and does so at the first opportunity.

	"If Eldeth didn't survive, she might have charged the characters with returning either her remains or her warhammer and shield to her home. This errand can bring the characters to Gauntlgrym of their own volition even before Bruenor's summons.": "如果埃尔德斯没能活下来，她可能会责成人物把她的遗体或她的战锤和盾牌送回她的家。这个任务可以让人物在布鲁诺的召唤之前就主动来到冈特格莱姆。",
	"Either aiding Eldeth's return or honoring her memory enhances the party's reputation with the dwarves of Gauntlgrym. It also reinforces King Bruenor's opinion that these adventurers are the right people to do the job of investigating the happenings in the Underdark.": "无论是帮助艾尔达斯归来还是纪念她，都能提高队伍在冈特格莱姆的矮人中的声誉。这也加强了布鲁诺国王的看法，即这些冒险者是调查暗黑世界事件的合适人选。",
	"Once the characters arrive at the gates of Gauntlgrym, they are welcomed as the king's guests and escorted into the underground city, through the Vault of Kings (see below), and shown to guest quarters.

	"In ages past, the subterranean city of Gauntlgrym was the capital of the ancient dwarven Delzoun Empire. Its cavernous halls—some large enough to contain entire surface villages—were carved with unerring precision, their ceilings soaring scores of feet overhead. Towering statues of dwarven gods and heroes stood vigil over chambers and thoroughfares, the least of which was wide enough to march fifty dwarves standing abreast.": "在过去的年代，地下城市Gauntlgrym是古老的矮人Delzoun帝国的首都。它的洞穴大厅--有些大到足以容纳整个地面村庄--被雕刻得精确无误，其天花板高达几十英尺。矮人诸神和英雄的高大雕像在厅堂和大道上守候，其中最宽的一条足以让50个矮人并排前行。",
	"The mines of Gauntlgrym produced endless tides of iron, silver, gold, and mithral, and booming trade brought goods and wealth to the city from across Faerûn. But it was the Great Forge that was the burning heart and true treasure of the city. Deep beneath the settled levels of Gauntlgrym, dwarven crafting and elven magic bound the slumbering primordial Maegera, a being of fire and destruction, harnessing its incredible powers to heat the forge. On anvils of adamantine blessed by priests of Moradin, great items of power were forged, their base material infused with a splinter of Maegera's essence. The unceasing wonders flowing from these forges helped make Gauntlgrym into one of the most magnificent cities Faerûn has ever known.": "Gauntlgrym的矿场生产出无穷无尽的铁、银、金和米特拉，繁荣的贸易将货物和财富从整个Faerûn带到这个城市。但是，大锻造厂才是这座城市燃烧的心脏和真正的财富。在Gauntlgrym定居层的深处，矮人的工艺和精灵的魔法将沉睡的原始Maegera--一种火与毁灭的存在--捆绑起来，利用其不可思议的力量来加热锻造。在摩拉丁祭司祝福的金刚砂铁砧上，伟大的权力物品被锻造出来，它们的基本材料被注入了迈格拉的精华碎片。源源不断的奇迹从这些锻造厂流出，使Gauntlgrym成为Faerûn有史以来最宏伟的城市之一。",
	"Relations between the great empires of the elves, dwarves, and humans soured as the centuries passed. And so when numberless hordes of orcs smashed into the north, each empire stood alone. The war was brutal and devastating. Gauntlgrym was swarmed by rampaging armies of orcs, and the empire of Delzoun was overrun in the terrible fighting. Ultimately, the dwarves of Delzoun drove back the orcs, but at great cost. The once-mighty dwarven empire was left crippled, never to recover, and the great city of Gauntlgrym was left in the control of an orc horde.": "随着几个世纪的过去，精灵、矮人和人类的大帝国之间的关系逐渐恶化。因此，当无数的兽人成群结队地闯入北方时，每个帝国都孤立无援。这场战争是残酷的、毁灭性的。Gauntlgrym被猖獗的兽人军队包围，Delzoun帝国也在可怕的战斗中被攻陷。最终，德尔祖恩的矮人击退了兽人，但付出了巨大的代价。曾经强大的矮人帝国被打成了残废，再也没有恢复，伟大的Gauntlgrym城也被兽人部落控制了。",
	"It was humans from nearby Illusk who finally drove the orcs from Gauntlgrym, but their hold on the city proved just as short-lived, as foul creatures from the Underdark swarmed from the depths to claim Gauntlgrym as their own. Over the next thousand years, history turned to legend, and mighty Gauntlgrym was all but forgotten on the surface world. Illithids, duergar, drow, and aboleths vied for control of the fallen city, its treasures, and the primordial still bound within its core. The drow House Xorlarrin eventually took Gauntlgrym, establishing a new city they called Q'Xorlarrin, producing weapons at the forge that they traded and used to pay tribute to Menzoberranzan.": "最终是来自附近的伊拉斯克的人类将兽人赶出了高特格林姆，但他们对这座城市的控制也很短暂，因为来自暗黑世界的邪恶生物从深处蜂拥而至，将高特格林姆据为己有。在接下来的一千年里，历史变成了传说，强大的Gauntlgrym在地面世界几乎被遗忘。伊利希德人、杜尔加人、乌鸦人和阿波利斯人争相控制这座沦陷的城市、它的财宝以及仍被束缚在其核心的原始人。Xorlarrin乌鸦家族最终占领了Gauntlgrym，建立了一个名为Q'Xorlarrin的新城市，在锻造厂生产武器，用来交易和向Menzoberranzan进贡。",
	"In recent years, the dwarf hero Bruenor Battlehammer was able to seize the fabled city back from its drow masters. Bruenor, along with his companions Wulfgar, Cattie-brie, Regis, and Drizzt Do'Urden, gathered many allies from the surface world and nearby Underdark communities and retook the city. They prevented Maegera from being unleashed upon Faerûn, and set about attempting to restore the city to its former glory. Bruenor now sits upon the Great Throne of Moradin, working to rebuild the city and keep it safe—even as a new threat looms in the depths of the Underdark.": "近年来，矮人英雄布鲁诺-战锤（Bruenor Battlehammer）得以从鸦人的主人手中夺回了这座传说中的城市。布鲁诺和他的同伴沃夫加（Wulfgar）、凯蒂-布里（Cattie-brie）、雷吉斯（Regis）以及德里兹-杜尔登（Drizzt Do'Urden）一起，从地表世界和附近的暗黑社区召集了许多盟友，重新夺回了这座城市。他们阻止了迈格拉在法鲁恩的释放，并开始尝试将城市恢复到以前的荣耀。布鲁诺现在坐在莫拉丁的大王座上，致力于重建城市并保持其安全--即使在暗黑世界的深处出现了新的威胁。",
	"The following areas within Gauntlgrym might be of some importance during this part of the adventure, although they don't represent the full measure of the city by any means. A detailed description of every level, chamber, and vault of Gauntlgrym would take up an entire volume of its own, and the characters have limited time to see the wonders of the dwarven city.": "在冒险的这一部分，Gauntlgrym的以下区域可能会有一定的重要性，尽管它们并不代表这个城市的全部规模。对Gauntlgrym的每一层、每一个房间和每一个拱顶的详细描述都会占去一整本书的篇幅，而且人物有有限的时间来欣赏这个矮人城市的奇迹。",
	"Gauntlgrym is a city carved out of the living rock, with halls and passages wide enough for the largest dragons to walk through. There are hundreds of levels, twisting stairs, functioning elevators, and a system of mine carts crossing in and out of the central hub of the Iron Tabernacle. The players should feel their characters are in a place of great antiquity, poised on the edge of reclaiming its ancient glory. By no means is the city fully occupied. Indeed, given the relatively small size of Bruenor's occupying force, keeping track of anyone within Gauntlgrym is nearly impossible.": "Gauntlgrym是一座从活石中雕刻出来的城市，大厅和通道宽得足以让最大的龙走过。这里有数以百计的关卡、曲折的楼梯、运作良好的电梯，以及一个穿越铁幕中心枢纽的矿车系统。玩家应该感觉到他们的角色是在一个非常古老的地方，正准备重新获得其古老的荣耀。这座城市绝不是完全被占领。事实上，鉴于布鲁诺的占领军规模相对较小，在Gauntlgrym内追踪任何人几乎是不可能的。",
	"In the upper levels and around the Iron Tabernacle and Vault of Kings, Gauntlgrym is brightly lit. {@i Driftglobes}, phosphorescent fungi, and huge braziers and troughs of burning coals fill most hallways and chambers. Lights in many parts of the city are dimmed somewhat during the nighttime hours, so that its residents can mark the passage of time on the surface world. In the lower reaches, around the Great Forge, light isn't as ubiquitous. Farther down, and in parts of the city yet to be reclaimed from the ruins of the past, there is no light other than whatever visitors bring with them.": "在上层和铁塔和国王金库周围，冈特格莱姆灯火通明。{@i Driftglobes}，磷光真菌，以及巨大的火炉和燃烧着的煤槽充斥着大多数走廊和房间。城市的许多地方的灯光在夜间的时候会变暗一些，这样它的居民就可以在表面世界标记时间的流逝。在下游的大锻造厂周围，灯光并不那么普遍。在更远的地方，以及城市中尚未从过去的废墟中开垦出来的部分，除了游客带来的东西外，没有其他的光。",
	"Mining was one of Gauntlgrym's primary sources of wealth and materials. To facilitate the movement of ore, as well as the great quantities of stone used to construct and expand the city, the dwarves laid miles of track traversed by mine carts propelled by enchantments woven into their wheels. Even after thousands of years, the tracks remain largely intact and the magic of the carts has not faded. Where the carts trundle steadily throughout the city, Gauntlgrym's residents use them for travel, hopping on and off along the system's wide range of routes. While in Gauntlgrym, the characters can also make use of this convenient transportation system.": "采矿是Gauntlgrym的主要财富和材料来源之一。为了方便矿石的运输，以及用于建造和扩建城市的大量石料，矮人铺设了数英里的轨道，由车轮上编织的魔法所推动的矿车穿过。即使过了几千年，这些轨道仍然基本完好，矿车的魔力也没有消退。矿车稳定地行驶在城市的各个角落，Gauntlgrym的居民则用它们来旅行，沿着系统的各种路线跳上跳下。在Gauntlgrym的时候，人物也可以利用这个便利的交通系统。",
	"All tracks eventually lead to a switching station in the Iron Tabernacle. There, posted operators manipulate levers and gears to transfer carts from one track to another.": "所有的轨道最终都通向铁幕的一个转换站。在那里，派驻的操作员操纵杠杆和齿轮，将小车从一条轨道转移到另一条轨道。",
	"Large enough to enclose a small town, this high-ceilinged chamber rises above a network of bridges, stone towers, and sturdy walls carved from rock and sheathed in iron and mithral. Dozens of smaller chambers lead out from the Vault of Kings, including sprawling residential areas not yet filled by Gauntlgrym's new occupants.": "这个高大的密室足以包围一个小镇，它耸立在由桥梁、石塔和由岩石雕刻而成的坚固墙壁组成的网络之上，并以铁和密特拉尔合金为外皮。几十个较小的房间从国王的金库中出来，包括尚未被冈特格雷姆的新住户填满的广阔的住宅区。",
	"The vault is on the same level as the city's main gates and can be reached from there, though a system of smaller gates and checkpoints has been set up to keep potential invaders from reaching as far as the throne room. That section of the vault, where the king spends a considerable amount of his time, is a large hall lined with pillars and benches, intended as a meeting place as much as a seat of rulership. The Great Throne of Moradin is protected by powerful magic, and forcefully ejects anyone but the rightful king who attempts to sit upon it. While so seated, Bruenor has advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks—a divine blessing granted to the king of Gauntlgrym by Moradin and the other dwarven gods.": "金库与城市的主门在同一层，可以从那里到达，尽管已经建立了一个由小门和检查站组成的系统，以防止潜在的入侵者达到王室的程度。金库的那一部分是国王花费大量时间的地方，是一个有柱子和长椅的大殿，目的是作为一个会议场所，而不是统治者的座位。莫拉丁的大王座受到强大的魔法保护，除了合法的国王之外，任何试图坐在上面的人都会被强行驱逐。在坐着的时候，布鲁诺在所有智力、智慧和魅力的检查中都有优势--这是莫拉丁和其他矮人神灵授予冈特格莱姆国王的神圣祝福。",
	"The majority of the city's current inhabitants live and work within the vault, happy to share tales of the city's reclamation and praise Bruenor's leadership at any opportunity. This is where the characters reside as Bruenor's guests, and where the representatives of the five factions are likely to be found. Here, residents and guests alike enjoy access to well-lit passages, comfortable quarters, and substantial amounts of food and drink.": "城市目前的大部分居民都在金库内生活和工作，他们乐于分享城市开垦的故事，并在任何机会下赞美布鲁诺的领导。这里是人物作为布鲁诺的客人居住的地方，也是有可能找到五个派别的代表的地方。在这里，居民和客人都能享受到光线充足的通道、舒适的住所以及大量的食物和饮料。",
	"The Iron Tabernacle is Gauntlgrym's spiritual and cultural heart as well as its physical center. More than a temple, the tabernacle is an entire section of the city larger than some surface towns, devoted to the faith of the former Delzoun Empire and of the dwarves who answered Bruenor's call to reclaim the city. Vast cathedrals of stone once echoed with the paeans of a thousand chanting voices. Great sculptures in honor of a multitude of gods gazed across an array of shrines and altars. Priests stood ready by night and day to tend to the spiritual needs of their people, and hundreds of stone tablets trumpeted the holy words of Moradin.": "铁幕是Gauntlgrym的精神和文化核心，也是它的物质中心。比起神庙，铁幕是城市的一整块区域，比一些地表城镇还要大，它致力于前德尔祖恩帝国的信仰，以及响应布鲁诺号召收回城市的矮人的信仰。巨大的石头大教堂曾经回荡着千百个吟唱者的颂歌。纪念众多神灵的巨大雕塑凝视着一连串的神龛和祭坛。祭司们夜以继日地准备着照顾他们人民的精神需求，数以百计的石板吹响了莫拉丁的圣言。",
	"Like so much else of ancient Gauntlgrym, the Iron Tabernacle isn't what it once was. The intricate patterns and knotwork have faded from the walls, some of the statues have begun to crumble, and many passages are blocked with rubble. The devilish duergar, once in control of the mines below, took delight in defiling the holy icons of the absent dwarves. They defaced statues, tore down altars, and carved obscenities into the sacred tablets. Anything of value, such as silver or mithral trim, gold icons, and hallowed weapons, has been completely scavenged.": "就像古代冈特格雷姆的许多其他地方一样，铁帐幕已经不是以前的样子了。墙上复杂的图案和绳结已经褪色，一些雕像已经开始坍塌，许多通道被碎石堵住。曾经控制着下面矿场的魔鬼杜尔加，以玷污缺席的矮人的圣像为乐。他们玷污了雕像，拆毁了祭坛，并在圣碑上刻下污言秽语。任何有价值的东西，如银或密特拉尔的饰物、黄金圣像和神圣的武器，都被完全搜刮一空。",
	"Shield dwarf {@creature Priest||priests} have begun the long task of rebuilding, revitalizing, and restoring the Iron Tabernacle to its former glory. The area is vast, and its halls are numerous and multileveled. The dwarf priests have restored many shrines and altars, and have cleared paths through the cracked and broken hallways to the Vault of Kings so that Bruenor can make personal visits to the main shrines and offer thanks to the gods. This procession often includes Bruenor's visitors or those ambassadors from the surface who come to Gauntlgrym to seek counsel with the king. Bruenor leads these processions not only to show off the city and its sheer size, but also to take measure of his guests' endurance and patience in matters of spirit.": "盾牌矮人{@creature Priest||priests}已经开始了重建、振兴和恢复铁幕的漫长任务，使其恢复昔日的荣光。这片区域非常广阔，其大厅数量众多，而且是多层次的。矮人祭司们修复了许多神龛和祭坛，并在裂缝和破损的走廊中清理出通往国王金库的道路，这样布鲁诺就可以亲自到主要的神龛前祭拜，向诸神致谢。这个队伍中经常包括布鲁诺的访客或那些来自地表的使者，他们来到Gauntlgrym寻求国王的建议。布鲁诺带领这些队伍不仅是为了炫耀这个城市和它的庞大规模，也是为了衡量他的客人在精神问题上的耐力和耐心。",
	"As the heart of Gauntlgrym, the Iron Tabernacle is the central hub of the city's passageways and railways. Broad corridors, winding stairs, iron rails, roadways carved into the earth—nearly all the city's major byways pass through the tabernacle. Every part of Gauntlgrym can be reached from this area, albeit sometimes indirectly. Notably, the Vault of Kings is about a mile to the north of the Iron Tabernacle, and the Great Forge is several hundred feet below it and a half mile to the south.": "作为Gauntlgrym的心脏，铁幕是城市通道和铁路的中心枢纽。宽阔的走廊、蜿蜒的楼梯、铁轨、刻在大地上的道路--几乎所有城市的主要通道都要经过这个会堂。Gauntlgrym的每个地方都可以从这里到达，尽管有时是间接的。值得注意的是，国王的金库在铁帐幕北面约一英里处，大锻造厂在铁帐幕下几百英尺处，南面有半英里。",
	"The lowest level of the Iron Tabernacle is a seemingly endless collection of crypts. Laid out according to patterns or traditions now lost to time, the tombs contain thousands of Gauntlgrym's honored dead. Some crypts are simple biers; others are intricate sarcophagi. All include names, titles, and lineage carved into the stone. A number of scholars have been drawn to Gauntlgrym in response to Bruenor's call, hoping to record a complete lineage of the great families of Gauntlgrym, including their possible connections to modern bloodlines, from an exhaustive study of the records carved in the crypt's stones.": "铁幕的最底层是一个似乎没有尽头的墓穴集合。这些墓穴按照现在已被时间遗忘的模式或传统铺设，里面有成千上万的高特立姆的尊贵死者。有些墓穴是简单的壁炉；有些是复杂的石棺。所有的墓穴都有刻在石头上的名字、头衔和世系。一些学者响应布鲁诺的号召被吸引到Gauntlgrym，希望通过对墓室石头上所刻记录的详尽研究，记录Gauntlgrym大家族的完整血统，包括他们与现代血统的可能联系。",
	"The Iron Tabernacle is close enough to some of the lower reaches and fissures in the Underdark that monsters from below occasionally find their way in and set up lairs in one shrine or another. The dwarves impress upon the characters to be on their guard, or to take guards with them, if they visit. From time to time, the sound of combat rings through the tabernacle hallways, a contrast to the chanting voices of the priests and a sure sign that something unwelcome has made its way into this most sacred of places.": "铁匠铺离暗黑世界的一些下游和裂缝足够近，以至于下面的怪物偶尔会找到他们的方式，并在一个或另一个神龛里建立巢穴。矮人让这些人物提高警惕，或者带着警卫，如果他们来的话。不时有战斗的声音在神龛的走廊上响起，这与祭司们的诵经声形成了鲜明的对比，也是不受欢迎的东西进入这个最神圣的地方的肯定信号。",
	"Check for a random encounter once every hour of travel in the Iron Tabernacle by rolling a {@dice d20} and consulting the table below to determine what, if anything, the characters meet.": "在铁幕中旅行时，每小时检查一次随机遭遇，方法是滚动{@dice d20}并查阅下表，以确定角色会遇到什么，如果有的话。",
	"1 dwarf {@creature ghost} (friendly unless attacked)": "1个矮人 {@creature ghost} (友好的，除非被攻击)",
	"Patrol consisting of six shield dwarf {@creature Veteran||veterans}": "由六个盾牌矮人组成的巡逻队 {@creature Veteran||veterans}",
	"The Great Forge is a cavernous chamber divided into smaller sections housing furnaces and anvils. Some areas of the cavern are raised on daises of stone, while others stand in shallow pits. Layers of stone catwalks crisscross the chamber, providing not only vantage points but also anchors for pulleys transporting buckets of ore and water throughout the forge. The Great Forge is about a half mile south of the Iron Tabernacle and several hundred feet below it, and can be reached by mine cart or on foot.": "大锻造室是一个洞穴，被分成若干小部分，里面有熔炉和铁砧。洞穴中的一些区域是在石头的雏形上升起的，而其他区域则是在浅坑中。一层层的石板走道纵横交错，不仅提供了有利的位置，还为整个锻造厂运送矿石和水桶的滑轮提供了锚点。大锻造厂在铁幕以南约半英里处，在铁幕下面几百英尺处，可以通过矿车或步行到达。",
	"It was said of old that the Iron Tabernacle was Gauntlgrym's heart, the Vault of Kings its mind, and the Great Forge its mighty hands. Here, on adamantine anvils blessed by Moradin's priests, wonders were hammered from iron, mithral, silver, and steel. When Gauntlgrym thrived, the forge echoed with the hammering and songs of a hundred smiths working at once. In time, it might do so again.": "古人说，铁幕是高特立姆的心脏，王穹是它的思想，而大锻造厂则是它强有力的双手。在这里，由莫拉丁的祭司祝福的金刚铁砧上，铁、米塔尔、银和钢的奇迹被锤炼出来。当Gauntlgrym繁荣的时候，锻造厂回荡着一百个铁匠同时工作的锤子和歌声。随着时间的推移，它可能会再次这样做。",
	"It was the furnaces of the Great Forge that made this place the apex of the dwarf smiths' art, for those furnaces are driven by the power of Maegera the Dawn Titan—a primordial imprisoned below them. Slumbering within the stone, Maegera exudes an unnatural heat that the dwarves tap into by winding coils of copper and adamantine throughout the forge like webs and using them as conduits to transfer magical heat to their furnaces. Runes of power carved into the walls and etched into the coils allow them to withstand the intense energy. Metals melt almost instantly in the furnaces of the Great Forge, and tools cast from those metals are enchanted with motes of primordial essence.": "正是大锻造厂的熔炉使这里成为矮人铁匠艺术的顶点，因为这些熔炉是由黎明泰坦迈格拉的力量驱动的--一个被囚禁在下面的原始人。沉睡在石头里的迈格拉散发出一种非自然的热量，矮人通过将铜和金刚砂的线圈像网一样缠绕在整个熔炉里，并将它们作为管道将魔法热量传递到熔炉中。刻在墙壁上的力量符文和刻在线圈上的符文使它们能够承受住强烈的能量。金属在大锻造炉中几乎瞬间融化，用这些金属铸造的工具被赋予了原始精华的斑纹。",
	"When Maegera awoke in the last century, the earth shook, and many of the furnaces' conduits were severed. Today, lengths of twine-thin metal hang limp and broken throughout the rubble of the Great Forge, which lies upon the bones of those unable to escape the collapse of bridges and walls. Other coils remain in place, and the furnaces to which they are linked burn as hot today as they did in centuries gone by.": "当迈格拉在上个世纪苏醒时，大地震动，许多熔炉的管道被切断了。今天，在大锻造厂的废墟上，长长的两根薄金属软绵绵地挂着，断断续续地躺在那些无法逃脱桥梁和墙壁坍塌的人的骨头上。其他线圈仍在原地，它们所连接的熔炉今天仍像过去几个世纪一样燃烧着。",
	"Heat and ruddy light emanate from a pit in the depths of Gauntlgrym. Chambers and tunnels lead away from this chasm at different heights. Despite channels built into the walls to carry water to the magma below, the heat from the pit is ferocious. Gouts of steam billow up through cracks in the stone to fill the chambers above this area, and the earth rumbles in a pulse like labored breathing.": "热量和红光从Gauntlgrym深处的一个坑里发出来。房间和隧道以不同的高度从这道鸿沟中延伸出来。尽管墙壁上建有通道，将水输送到下面的岩浆中，但坑里的热量还是很凶猛。大量的蒸汽从石头的缝隙中涌出，填满了这个区域上方的房间，大地发出隆隆的脉搏声，就像费力的呼吸。",
	"The Fiery Pit is the prison of the primordial known as Maegera, who slumbers fitfully in its depths. The only sign of the entity's presence is a whirlpool of white-hot magma that resembles a great eye, set in the center of the lake of molten rock at the pit's bottom. Maegera sleeps and dreams, half conscious of its surroundings and half delirious with whatever dreams haunt a being of pure destruction.": "火坑是被称为 \"Maegera \"的原始人的监狱，他在火坑的深处昏昏欲睡。这个实体存在的唯一标志是一个白热岩浆的漩涡，它就像一只巨大的眼睛，镶嵌在坑底熔岩湖的中心。麦格拉睡觉和做梦，一半意识到周围的环境，一半被萦绕在一个纯粹的毁灭者身上的任何梦境所迷惑。",
	"When the mages of the Arcane Brotherhood first tapped into Maegera's power, they used water magic to bind elementals that cooled the primordial's rage and kept it asleep. This bond lasted for centuries until the channels of water were closed through trickery by agents of Thay. With the pit's cooling mechanism shut down, Maegera stirred in its slumber, and its dream of ruination was enough to destroy Gauntlgrym.": "当奥术兄弟会的法师们第一次挖掘迈格拉的力量时，他们用水的魔法来束缚元素，冷却了原始人的愤怒，使其沉睡。这种结合持续了几个世纪，直到水的通道被泰伊的代理人以欺骗的方式关闭。随着深坑冷却机制的关闭，麦格拉在沉睡中蠢蠢欲动，它的毁灭之梦足以摧毁冈特格莱姆。",
	"In the years following, Maegera groggily awoke from time to time, causing earthquakes throughout the region. Eventually, the primordial was returned to its slumber through the efforts of Bruenor, Drizzt Do'Urden, Jarlaxle, and other heroes. Where Maegera sleeps now, the intense heat it generates once again fires the Great Forge of Gauntlgrym.": "在随后的几年里，麦格拉不时地呻吟着醒来，在整个地区引起地震。最终，在布鲁诺、德里兹特-杜尔登、贾拉索和其他英雄的努力下，这个原始的东西又恢复了沉睡。在麦格拉现在沉睡的地方，它产生的强烈热量再次点燃了冈特格雷姆的大锻造炉。",
	"Under Bruenor's watchful governance, the Great Forge has again begun to produce metalworks. If the characters are in the market for any metal goods (including arms and armor), or have any such goods in need of repair or replacement, the dwarves of the Great Forge are happy to help. No magic weapons or armor are available for sale, although damaged magic items can be repaired.": "在布鲁诺的监督下，大锻造厂又开始生产金属制品了。如果人物在市场上需要任何金属制品（包括武器和盔甲），或者有任何需要修理或更换的此类物品，大锻造厂的矮人很乐意提供帮助。没有魔法武器或盔甲可供出售，尽管损坏的魔法物品可以被修复。",

	"This chapter is dominated by negotiation, social activity, and diplomacy—first directed at the characters, then directed by them. The adventurers must first hear what King Bruenor has to say as he entreats them to head back into the Underdark to find out more about the rising threat of the demon lords. Then the characters must help convince the other factions summoned to Gauntlgrym to aid them on their mission. This section of the adventure has some opportunity for action, but players who enjoy plotting, making plans, and pitting NPCs against one another can shine here.": "这一章主要是谈判、社交活动和外交活动--先是针对人物，然后由他们指导。冒险家们必须首先听取布鲁诺国王的意见，他恳请他们返回暗黑世界，以了解更多关于恶魔领主的威胁。然后，角色们必须帮助说服被召唤到Gauntlgrym的其他派别，帮助他们完成任务。冒险的这一部分有一些行动的机会，但是喜欢密谋、制定计划和让NPC互相对立的玩家可以在这里大放异彩。",
	"Take note of your players' preferences. If they're not much for long periods of conversation with NPCs, you might want to move things along a little more quickly. On the other hand, you can really bring to life not just the faction representatives and the dwarf king in this chapter, but also highlight the personalities and goals of the characters and any NPCs who remain with them.": "注意到你的玩家的喜好。如果他们不喜欢与NPC进行长时间的对话，你可能想把事情进展得更快一些。另一方面，在这一章中，你不仅可以让派别代表和矮人国王真正活起来，还可以突出人物和任何留在他们身边的NPC的个性和目标。",
	"After the characters arrive and are shown to guest accommodations, they are allowed some time to refresh and prepare themselves. They are then called to an audience with Bruenor Battlehammer, the king of Gauntlgrym. Read or paraphrase the following:": "在人物到达并被带到客人的住处后，他们被允许有一些时间来养精蓄锐和准备自己。然后，他们被叫去觐见冈特格莱姆的国王布鲁诺-战锤。阅读或解读以下内容。",
	"You are taken to a mighty hall in which a red-haired dwarf of fierce and proud demeanor sits upon a massive stone throne, flanked by a number of guards and advisors. Although a long stone table has been set to one side, laid out with refreshments, there do not appear to be any other guests. \"Welcome, friends,\" says the king. \"I've a mind to know about the rumblings and rumors about goings-on in the depths outside my city. If ye relate to me what ye know, we can talk about what ye might want to do next.\"": "你被带到一个巨大的大厅，里面有一个红发的矮人，举止凶狠而骄傲，坐在一个巨大的石座上，两边是一些卫兵和顾问。虽然一边摆放着一张长长的石桌，上面摆放着茶点，但似乎没有任何其他客人。\"欢迎，朋友们，\"国王说。\"我很想知道关于我的城市外面深处的隆隆声和谣言的情况。如果你们把你们所知道的告诉我，我们可以谈谈你们接下来可能要做的事情。\"",
	"King Bruenor listens carefully to what the adventurers have to say. Once the adventurers have told their tale, Bruenor might have a few questions, particularly concerning the threat of the demon lords. The dwarf king answers questions from the characters if they have any. However, if asked about his overall plans, he says simply that he must consider all the information presented to him and consult with advisors. With the audience at an end, Bruenor tells the characters he will consider all they have told him, and that they will speak again at a welcoming feast later that night.": "布鲁诺国王仔细听着冒险家们的讲述。一旦冒险者讲述完他们的故事，布鲁诺可能会有一些问题，特别是关于恶魔领主的威胁。矮人国王会回答角色们的问题，如果他们有任何问题。然而，如果被问及他的整体计划，他只是说他必须考虑所有提交给他的信息，并与顾问协商。随着听证会的结束，布鲁诺告诉这些人物他将考虑他们所告诉他的一切，并且他们将在当天晚上的欢迎宴会上再次交谈。",
	"After the characters have had a chance to speak with Bruenor and take care of any personal business, the Vault of Kings plays host to a memorable feast. In attendance are representatives of different factions from the surface world, who have come to Gauntlgrym following rumors of bizarre events in the Underdark. If any of the adventurers belong to a faction, representatives of that faction might even be following up on information provided by the characters themselves. See \"Forging an Alliance\" for more information.": "在角色们有机会与布鲁诺交谈并处理任何个人事务之后，\"国王的金库 \"将举办一场令人难忘的盛宴。参加宴会的有来自地面世界的不同派别的代表，他们是在暗黑世界发生怪异事件的传言之后来到高特立姆的。如果冒险者中有人属于某个派别，该派别的代表甚至可能会跟进人物自己提供的信息。更多信息请参见 \"建立联盟\"。",
	"The celebration serves both to welcome the adventurers, who are seated at the high table with Bruenor, and to provide an opportunity for the representatives of the different factions to gather socially and be officially introduced to the adventurers. In addition to the king and his allies, a number of dwarves from Bruenor's court and important citizens of Gauntlgrym are also present. The feast is also an opportunity for you to include NPCs of your choice who might either be from or visiting Gauntlgrym, or part of the entourage of one of the representatives.": "庆祝活动既是为了欢迎冒险者，他们与布鲁诺一起坐在高桌旁，也为不同派别的代表提供了一个社交聚会和正式介绍冒险者的机会。除了国王和他的盟友之外，一些来自布鲁诺宫廷的矮人和冈特格莱姆的重要公民也会出席。宴会也是一个机会，你可以让你选择的NPC参加，他们可能来自或访问Gauntlgrym，或者是某个代表的随行人员的一部分。",
	"This is a free-form scene, which you can play out as best suits your group. It can range from a detailed roleplaying session, with characters mixing and mingling with their potential allies and members of Gauntlgrym society, or just a brief description of the event and the characters' initial impressions of the faction representatives, before their later efforts to negotiate with those representatives for the factions' aid.": "这是一个自由形式的场景，你可以按照最适合你的小组的方式来进行表演。它可以是一个详细的角色扮演会议，人物与他们的潜在盟友和Gauntlgrym社会成员混杂在一起，或者只是对事件的简要描述和人物对派别代表的初步印象，然后再努力与这些代表谈判以获得派别的援助。",
	"Once the feast winds down, Bruenor excuses himself as the guests depart. Shortly thereafter, a servant comes to collect the characters and takes them to a private chamber where the king of Gauntlgrym awaits them. His previously friendly manner has turned grave.": "宴会一结束，布鲁诺就借口客人离开而离开了。此后不久，一个仆人来接他们，把他们带到一个私人房间，Gauntlgrym的国王在那里等着他们。他以前的友好态度已经变成了严肃。",
	"\"I've told the allies ye met tonight what ye told me,\" he says. \"I invited them here to learn what is happening, to share what we know, and to get their backing for what it is I propose. Ye have braved the Underdark and lived to tell the tale. Ye know, better than anyone, what it is we face, but we need to know more.": "\"我已经把你们今晚遇到的盟友告诉了我，\"他说。\"我邀请他们来这里了解发生了什么，分享我们所知道的，并获得他们对我提议的支持。你曾勇敢地闯过暗黑世界，并活到了现在。你比任何人都清楚，我们面临的是什么，但我们需要知道更多。",
	"\"I don't propose to send ye into the dark unprepared, and I hope ye make an impression on those gathered here so they'll support our cause and your mission. From all I've seen and heard, there's no one better to do what needs be done.": "\"我不打算让你们在毫无准备的情况下进入黑暗，我希望你们能给聚集在这里的人留下印象，这样他们就会支持我们的事业和你们的任务。从我所见所闻来看，没有人比你更适合做需要做的事。",
	"\"So, what say ye?\"": "\"那么，你们怎么说？\"",
	"Paraphrase Bruenor's speech as needed to handle interjections by the characters. The king provides honest answers to any questions. He truly does believe the characters represent the best option to find out more about the demonic threat, unless they've given him any reason to think otherwise.": "根据需要转述布鲁诺的讲话，处理人物的插话。国王对任何问题都给予诚实的回答。他确实相信这些人物是了解恶魔威胁的最佳选择，除非他们给了他任何其他的理由。",
	"Bruenor assures the adventurers they will have his gratitude and that of all Gauntlgrym—indeed, of all Faerûn—if they are successful. If the characters press for details or try to negotiate compensation for their service, the king points out that Gauntlgrym has considerable space, and he can offer them titles, property, and the products of the Great Forge as rewards. Such mercenary negotiation lowers Bruenor's opinion of the adventurers a bit, but he never loses his genial manner.": "布鲁诺向冒险家们保证，如果他们成功了，他和整个Gauntlgrym--实际上是整个Faerûn--都会对他们表示感谢。如果冒险者们要求了解细节或试图就他们的服务进行谈判，国王会指出Gauntlgrym有相当大的空间，他可以为他们提供头衔、财产和大锻造厂的产品作为奖励。这样的雇佣兵谈判使布鲁诺对冒险者的评价降低了一些，但他从未失去他的和蔼可亲的态度。",
	"If the characters are agreeable, the king tells them the next step is to bring the various factions on board. One of the reasons he is looking to the adventurers to lead a new mission into the Underdark, apart from their experience, is that they can serve as brokers among all the various parties with an interest in the mission. They need to meet with the different faction representatives, emphasizing the importance of getting the Zhentarim to agree to grant access to Mantol-Derith.

If one of the characters is a member of the Zhentarim, Davra tries to make the deal for information with that character alone.": "镇塔林的情报收集资源和对一个成熟的暗黑前哨的访问使该组织拥有所有派别中最强大的力量，达芙拉也知道这一点。进入曼托尔-德里斯是计划的关键，尽管她最终不会从冒险者那里扣留这个机会，但她打算确保它不会被免费送出。如果可能的话，戴弗拉会直接和冒险者打交道，而且是私下打交道，要求他们在下一次入侵暗黑世界时获得全部的财宝，并向她报告所有提供给布鲁诺或其他派别领导人的信息。如果其中一个角色是Zhentarim的成员，Davra会尝试单独与该角色进行信息交易。",
	"In addition to access to the hidden trading post of Mantol-Derith, Davra Jassur can provide Zhentarim mercenaries to fill out the expedition. These eight human thugs proudly wear the crest of the Black Network on their armor. If these NPCs join the party, make eight photocopies of the {@creature Zhentarim Thug|OotA} stat card at the end of this chapter. If you don't want to control these NPCs yourself, you can distribute their stat cards among the players and let them run the NPCs. The thugs' names are Nero Kelvane, Lenora Haskur, Aligor Moonwhisper, Gorath Torn, Saliyra Dalnor, Primwin Halk, Iandro Alathar, and Lhytris Ilgarn. All of them know the route to Mantol-Derith.": "除了可以进入曼托尔-德里斯的隐蔽贸易站外，达夫拉-贾苏尔还可以提供真塔里姆雇佣兵来充实探险队的力量。这八个人类打手在他们的盔甲上自豪地佩戴着黑网的徽章。如果这些NPC加入了队伍，请将本章末尾的{@creature Zhentarim Thug|OotA}状态卡复印八份。如果你不想自己控制这些NPC，你可以把他们的状态卡分给玩家，让他们来管理这些NPC。这些打手的名字是：尼禄-凯尔文（Nero Kelvane）、莱诺拉-哈斯库尔（Lenora Haskur）、阿里戈尔-月语（Aligor Moonwhisper）、戈拉斯-托恩（Gorath Torn）、萨利拉-达尔诺（Saliyra Dalnor）、普里姆温-哈尔克（Primwin Halk）、伊安卓-阿拉瑟（Iandro Alathar）和莱特里斯-伊尔加恩（Lhytris Ilgarn）。他们都知道通往曼托尔-德里斯的路线。",

	"Depending on how negotiations go, the characters are either an advance force to scout and soften up opposition in the Underdark while looking for valuable strategic information, or a diversionary expedition meant to buy time for the surface world to organize a stronger response. Faction representatives not impressed by the adventurers' cause might return to their factions convinced that the characters have little chance of succeeding—or surviving. The others are confident that the characters can live up to the promise they demonstrated in escaping from the drow and the Underdark.": "根据谈判的进展情况，这些角色要么是侦察和软化地下世界反对派的先头部队，同时寻找有价值的战略信息，要么是一次声东击西的远征，旨在为地面世界组织更有力的回应争取时间。没有被冒险者的事业所打动的派别代表可能会回到他们的派别，确信这些角色没有什么成功的机会，也没有什么生存的机会。而其他人则相信，这些角色能够兑现他们在逃离乌鸦和暗黑世界时所表现出的承诺。",
	"King Bruenor convenes a final gathering of his inner circle of advisors and the adventurers, giving the characters his thanks for their commitment to the fight against the demon lords.": "布鲁诺国王召集了他的顾问团和冒险家们的最后一次聚会，感谢他们对打击恶魔领主的承诺。",

	"Mantol-Derith has endured for centuries as a neutral outpost where drow, duergar, svirfneblin, and surface dwellers can meet and trade without fearing for their lives. Despite its usefulness and the safety it enjoys, Mantol-Derith has never become a proper town. Those who maintain it as a trade hub have resisted any urge for expansion, apart from installing basic infrastructure to assist with commercial activities.": "Mantol-Derith作为一个中立的前哨站已经持续了几个世纪，在这里，乌鸦、duergar、svirfneblin和地表居民可以会面和交易而不用担心他们的生命。尽管曼托尔-德里斯很有用，也很安全，但它从未成为一个合适的城镇。那些将其作为贸易中心的人，除了安装基本的基础设施以协助商业活动外，一直抵制任何扩张的冲动。",

	"Upon arrival, however, the characters discover there is no safe haven anywhere in the Underdark with the demon lords running rampant. The safety of Mantol-Derith has been shattered by the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu, who has turned the trading outpost's various factions against one another.": "然而，在抵达后，角色们发现在暗黑世界的任何地方都没有安全的避风港，恶魔领主们横行霸道。曼托尔-德里斯的安全已经被恶魔领主弗雷兹-乌尔布鲁（Fraz-Urb'luu）打破了，他让贸易前哨的各个派别相互对抗。",
	"Having previously been imprisoned for many mortal lifetimes on the Material Plane, Fraz-Urb'luu had taken steps to bind himself to his layer of the Abyss. As soon as he felt the tug of Gromph's spell, Fraz-Urb'luu transferred his evil life force to a specially crafted, magically protected receptacle—a black jewel. However, the spell proved irresistible, and the precious receptacle was cast into the Underdark. As a further indignity, Fraz-Urb'luu found himself trapped within the gem, unable to escape while on the Material Plane.": "由于之前在物质界被囚禁了许多个凡人的生命，弗雷兹-乌尔布鲁已经采取措施将自己捆绑在他的那层深渊上。当他感觉到格罗夫的咒语的牵引时，弗雷兹-乌尔布鲁就把他邪恶的生命力转移到一个特别制作的、受魔法保护的容器中--一个黑色的宝石。然而，这个咒语被证明是不可抗拒的，这个珍贵的容器被扔进了地下世界。作为进一步的侮辱，弗雷兹-乌尔布鲁发现自己被困在宝石中，在物质世界中无法逃脱。",
	"Anyone who touches the gem risks falling prey to delusional madness. A duergar ale merchant named Krimgol Muzgardt found the gem and took it to Mantol-Derith. By the time he arrived, Krimgol had succumbed to the delusion that he was a {@i calassabrak}—a duergar without honor. He paid Yantha Coaxrock, an honest svirfneblin mage, to appraise the jewel, hoping that he could use it to buy back the goodwill of his clan. Touched by the gem's madness, Yantha lied to Krimgol and told him the gem was worthless. She offered a lump of gold in exchange, whereupon Krimgol suspected treachery and demanded the gem's immediate return. While Krimgol and Yantha argued, one of Yantha's apprentices tried to hide the gem for his mistress but succumbed to its evil power. The apprentice, Flink, took the gem to the drow enclave, hoping to trade it for some rare spell components that he imagined Yantha needing to make Krimgol go away. A gargoyle assigned to watch for thieves spotted the gem and wrested it from Flink, who hid for fear of incurring Yantha's wrath. Soon thereafter, the delusional gargoyle laid eyes on a drow assassin named {@creature Kinyel Druu'giir|OotA} and was instantly smitten by her. The gargoyle gave her the black gem as a token of its devotion, which she, in her madness, mistook as a payment from the drow enclave to assassinate {@creature Lorthuun|OotA}, a maimed beholder allied with the Zhentarim.": "任何接触到宝石的人都有可能沦为妄想症的受害者。一个名叫克里姆戈尔-穆兹加德特（Krimgol Muzgardt）的酒商发现了这颗宝石，并把它带到了曼托尔-德里斯。当他到达时，克里姆戈尔已经屈服于他是一个{@i calassabrak}的妄想--一个没有荣誉的杜尔加人。他付钱给Yantha Coaxrock，一个诚实的svirfneblin法师，让他评估这颗宝石，希望他能用它来买回他家族的善意。被宝石的疯狂所感动，Yantha对Krimgol撒了谎，告诉他宝石一文不值。她提供了一块金子作为交换，Krimgol怀疑她是背叛者，要求她立即归还宝石。当Krimgol和Yantha争论不休时，Yantha的一个学徒试图为他的女主人隐藏宝石，但却屈服于宝石的邪恶力量。这个学徒，弗林克，把宝石带到了乌鸦的飞地，希望用它来换取一些稀有的法术组件，他认为燕莎需要这些组件来使克里姆戈尔离开。一个被指派监视小偷的夜行神龙发现了宝石，并从弗林克手中夺走了它，弗林克因为害怕招致炎塔的愤怒而躲了起来。此后不久，这个有妄想症的夜行神龙看到了一个名叫{@creature Kinyel Druu'giir|OotA}的乌鸦刺客，立刻被她迷住了。夜行神龙给了她黑色的宝石作为奉献的信物，而她在疯狂中误以为是来自乌鸦飞地的报酬，要她去刺杀{@creature Lorthuun|OotA}，一个与Zhentarim结盟的残缺的beholder。",
	"Yantha's theft of the gem led Krimgol to leave and return with duergar reinforcements. They attacked the svirfneblin enclave and captured Yantha, triggering open conflict between the two enclaves.

It is also immune to any spell effect that requires a saving throw. While inside the gem, the demon lord can't be attacked, harmed, coerced, or heard. He can be contacted via telepathy, however. Shattering the gem releases Fraz-Urb'luu's life force, which instantly returns to the demon lord's body in the Abyss.": "找到并摧毁这颗宝石可以防止其他人沦为Fraz-Urb'luu疯狂的猎物。当被囚禁在宝石内时，{@creature Fraz-Urb'luu|MTF}保留了他的方向和感官（见{@adventure appendix D|OotA|20}），但失去了他所有的其他属性，也不能采取行动。宝石和人的拳头一样大，AC值为10，命中率为1，对毒药和精神伤害免疫，对来自非魔法武器的击打、穿刺和切割伤害免疫。它也对任何需要蓄力的法术效果免疫。在宝石内，恶魔领主不能被攻击、伤害、胁迫或听到。然而，他可以通过心灵感应联系到他。打碎宝石会释放出Fraz-Urb'luu的生命力，而这些生命力会立即返回恶魔领主在深渊中的身体。",

	"Character advancement through this section of the adventure is important. The journey from Mantol-Derith to Gravenhollow should involve sufficient encounters and challenges for the characters to reach 10th level by the time they visit the stone giant library. As the characters travel from place to place, check for random encounters as normal (see {@area chapter 2|07f|x}), but swap out the creature encounters with ones presented in this chapter. Ideally, the characters should be 14th level by the time they crash Zuggtmoy's wedding (chapter 16, \"{@adventure The Fetid Wedding|OotA|15}\"), and 15th level for the final showdown against the demon lords (see chapter 17, \"{@adventure Against the Demon Lords|OotA|16}\").": "通过这一部分的冒险，角色的提升是很重要的。从Mantol-Derith到Gravenhollow的旅程应该有足够的遭遇和挑战，使角色在访问石巨人图书馆时达到10级。当角色从一个地方走到另一个地方时，像往常一样检查随机遭遇（见{@area chapter 2|07f|x}），但是要把生物遭遇换成本章介绍的遭遇。理想情况下，在他们撞破Zuggtmoy的婚礼时（第16章，\"{@adventure The Fetid Wedding|OotA|15}\"），人物应该达到14级，在与恶魔领主的最后决战中达到15级（见第17章，\"{@adventure Against the Demon Lords|OotA|16}\"）。",
	"The characters initially traveled through the Underdark as a small group, perhaps joined by a few of their fellow prisoners from Velkynvelve and other allies they met along the way. Now, they return to the subterranean realm at the head of a group of allies that might outnumber the adventurers four-to-one, depending on how many NPCs were recruited from the factions in Gauntlgrym (see {@adventure chapter 8|OotA|7}). This changes some of the conditions described in \"{@area Underdark Travel|051|x}\" in chapter 2.": "这些角色最初是以一个小团体的形式穿越地下世界的，也许还有一些来自维尔基维尔的囚犯和他们在路上遇到的其他盟友加入。现在，他们在一群盟友的带领下回到了地下世界，这些盟友的人数可能超过冒险者的四分之一，这取决于从Gauntlgrym的派别中招募了多少NPC（见{@adventure chapter 8|OotA|7}）。这改变了第二章\"{@area Underdark Travel|051|x} \"中描述的一些条件。",
	"When dealing with combat between large groups of creatures—either the adventurers' allies or their foes—you might wish to use the guidelines under \"{@book Handling Mobs|DMG|8|Handling Mobs}\" in chapter 8 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}. In some cases, you can simply match forces on one side with those on the other and assume they neutralize each other—for example, a band of shield dwarves fighting for the adventurers against a band of orcs. During such combat, the force on the losing side is wiped out while the winning force suffers a few casualties—anywhere from 10 to 50 percent—based on how difficult you judge the combat was for them.": "当处理大群生物之间的战斗时--无论是冒险者的盟友还是他们的敌人--你可能希望使用《{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}》第八章中\"{@book Handling Mobs|DMG|8|Handling Mobs} \"下的准则。在某些情况下，你可以简单地将一方的力量与另一方的力量相匹配，并假设他们互相抵消--例如，一队盾牌矮人为冒险者与一队兽人作战。在这样的战斗中，失败一方的部队被消灭了，而胜利一方的部队则遭受了一些伤亡--从10%到50%不等，这取决于你判断战斗对他们的难度。",
	"The tunnels and passages of the Underdark aren't easy routes through which to lead a large group of NPCs. When the characters set out, have the players describe how their expeditionary force is arrayed while traveling in single file, two abreast, and in open formation in wide-open spaces. Also ask the players if any of the NPCs are scouting ahead or serving as a rear guard (see \"{@area Scouting|399|x},\" below) or if the larger party remains in close formation at all times.": "地下城的隧道和通道并不容易带领一大群NPC通过。当人物出发时，让玩家描述他们的远征军是如何列队的，同时以单列、两列和开放的队形在宽阔的空间行进。还要问玩家是否有NPC在前面侦查或充当后卫（见下面的\"{@area Scouting|399|x}\"），或者大部队是否一直保持紧密队形。",
	"The marching order affects where and how different encounters might occur, particularly if they happen while characters are marching single file or two abreast. A threat approaching from above, below, or the flank could strike the middle of the expanded party, making it difficult for the characters at either end to reach it. Likewise, spellcasters must be aware of the allies around them at all times when casting area spells that don't solely target enemies.": "行军顺序会影响到不同遭遇的发生地点和方式，特别是如果它们发生在人物单排或两排行进时。从上方、下方或侧翼接近的威胁可能会袭击扩大的队伍的中部，使两端的角色难以到达。同样地，施法者在施放不只针对敌人的区域性法术时，必须随时注意他们周围的盟友。",
	"The pace of Underdark travel remains as outlined in {@area chapter 2|051|x}, and the characters move no slower for traveling with a larger party. Although a portion of the expeditionary force might be mounted on giant lizards, the lizards travel at the pace of the rest of the party unless they move out ahead.": "地下城旅行的速度仍然与{@area chapter 2|051|x}中所描述的一样，而且人物在与较大的队伍一起旅行时，移动速度不会慢。尽管一部分远征军可能骑在巨型蜥蜴身上，但除非蜥蜴走在前面，否则它们会以其他队伍的速度前进。",
	"As noted in {@area chapter 2|051|x}, a fast pace makes it harder for characters to spot ambushers or items of interest, and prevents characters from foraging. A slow pace improves chances of foraging. However, even while traveling at a slow pace, the characters and the NPCs can't use stealth, since they are too large a group to go unnoticed. {@skill Stealth} is an option only for a smaller scouting party traveling away from the main force (see \"{@area Scouting|399|x}\").": "如{@area chapter 2|051|x}所述，快节奏使角色更难发现伏击者或感兴趣的物品，并阻止角色觅食。缓慢的步伐可以提高觅食的机会。然而，即使在慢速旅行时，人物和NPC也不能使用隐身术，因为他们的队伍太大，不可能不被注意。{@skill Stealth}只适用于远离大部队的小型侦察队（见\"{@area Scouting|399|x}\"）。",
	"While traveling as part of a larger group, the characters have an easier time navigating their way through the Underdark than they did during their initial escape. The characters' own experience, plus that of their followers, along with maps and other information they might have acquired in Gauntlgrym or elsewhere, give all members of the expanded party advantage on any Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) checks to avoid becoming lost (see chapter 5, \"{@book Adventure Environments|DMG|5|Becoming Lost},\" of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}).": "在作为大队伍的一部分旅行时，角色们在暗黑世界中的导航比他们最初逃跑时更容易。角色们自己的经验，加上他们的追随者的经验，以及他们在Gauntlgrym或其他地方可能获得的地图和其他信息，使扩大的队伍中的所有成员在任何智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查中都有优势，以避免迷路（见{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}的第五章，\"{@book Adventure Environments|DMG|5|Becoming Lost}\"）。",
	"A portion of the expanded party can break off in order to travel some distance ahead, scouting for the right path while remaining on the lookout for potential hazards. A smaller group might also lag behind, serving as a rearguard watching for threats coming up behind the characters as they travel. NPCs can serve as scouts or members of a rearguard as the players wish. Some of the adventurers might choose to do so as well.": "一部分扩大的队伍可以分开，以便在前面走一段距离，探寻正确的道路，同时保持对潜在危险的警惕。一小部分人也可以落在后面，作为后卫，在他们旅行时注意后面的威胁。NPC可以按照玩家的意愿充当侦察兵或后卫成员。一些冒险者也可能选择这样做。",
	"A smaller scouting group can make use of stealth to travel unnoticed. If a random encounter occurs during the journey, characters in the scouting party discover it first and can choose whether to avoid or deal with the encounter. If characters in the scouting party notice the encounter without being seen themselves, they can retreat back to the main force to inform the other characters. Similarly, if a random encounter escapes the scouting characters' notice, the encountered creatures can lie in wait for the rest of the characters in order to ambush them.": "一个较小的侦察队可以利用隐身术在无人注意的情况下旅行。如果在旅途中发生了随机的遭遇，侦察队中的人物会首先发现它，并可以选择是避免还是处理这个遭遇。如果侦察队中的人物注意到了这个遭遇，而自己却没有被发现，他们可以退回到主力部队，通知其他人物。同样地，如果随机遇到的情况逃过了侦察队角色的注意，那么遇到的生物可以埋伏在其他角色身边，以便伏击他们。",
	"No longer a ragtag band of survivors and prisoners, the adventurers are now in command of a dedicated force of NPC followers. In addition to the advantages that brings, the characters must assume leadership roles as they deal with allies who might not entirely trust or respect them—or each other. Add in the dangers of the Underdark, along with the unpredictable influence of demonic madness, and the characters have several new challenges that must be faced.": "冒险家们不再是由幸存者和囚犯组成的破烂不堪的队伍，他们现在指挥着一支由NPC追随者组成的专门部队。除了带来的好处外，人物必须承担领导角色，因为他们要与可能不完全信任或尊重他们或彼此的盟友打交道。再加上暗黑世界的危险，以及恶魔的疯狂带来的不可预测的影响，角色们有几个必须面对的新挑战。",
	"Although the NPCs the characters lead are ostensibly allies, many belong to different factions, and old grudges and differences in ethos aren't easily set aside. Personality conflicts might arise among the followers in the expanded party, and the adventurers would be well advised to head off potential trouble. For example, having Lords' Alliance troops acting as scouts while keeping Zhentarim mercenaries close at hand will help keep those factions from fighting.": "虽然人物领导的NPC表面上是盟友，但许多人属于不同的派别，旧时的怨恨和精神上的差异不容易被搁置。在扩大的队伍中，追随者之间可能会出现性格上的冲突，冒险家们最好能避免潜在的麻烦。例如，让领主联盟的部队充当侦察兵，同时让赞塔林的雇佣兵近在咫尺，将有助于防止这些派别发生冲突。",
	"The NPCs following the characters into the Underdark are just as vulnerable to demonic madness. However, rather than make saving throws or track madness levels for each individual NPC, use the Random Events table in this chapter to determine when madness appears among those followers.": "跟随角色进入暗黑世界的NPC也同样容易受到恶魔的疯狂影响。然而，与其为每个NPC做拯救动作或追踪疯狂程度，不如使用本章的随机事件表来决定疯狂何时出现在这些追随者中。",
	"When madness appears among the NPCs, use it not just for its mechanical effects but to create real complications for the adventurers. For example, if the Random Events table indicates that one member of the expanded party suffers long-term madness, you might decide to bestow extreme paranoia on that NPC. In addition to the effect of Wisdom and Charisma checks, that character might believe that the adventurers are actually agents of the demon lords, and are intent on leading the NPCs to their doom.": "当疯狂出现在NPC中时，不仅要利用它的机械效果，还要为冒险者创造真正的复杂情况。例如，如果随机事件表显示，扩大的一方中的一个成员遭受了长期的疯狂，你可能会决定将极端的偏执赋予那个NPC。除了智慧和魅力检查的效果外，该角色可能会认为冒险者实际上是恶魔领主的代理人，并打算将NPC引向他们的末日。",
	"Having the adventurers leading an expanded party gives you the opportunity to use the optional loyalty rules in chapter 4, \"{@book Creating Nonplayer Characters|DMG|4|Optional Rule: Loyalty},\" of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}.

	"The factions in Gauntlgrym see to it that the expeditionary force is well provisioned with whatever the characters' expeditionary force can carry.

Although the NPCs all accompany the adventurers out of loyalty to their factions—and on orders from their superiors in Gauntlgrym—the characters' treatment of the NPCs influences the loyalty of those followers during the mission into the Underdark.": "就像他们必须确保为所有的NPC提供足够的补给一样，角色需要考虑如何最好地与他们的追随者分享遭遇和冒险的战利品。虽然NPC都是出于对自己派系的忠诚而陪伴冒险者的，而且是在Gauntlgrym的上级的命令下，但在进入暗黑世界的任务中，角色对NPC的处理影响了这些追随者的忠诚度。",
	"The characters should come up with some means for dividing any treasure taken on the expedition between the NPCs. As long as the division is reasonably fair, most of the followers will be content. However, the NPCs will complain if all the choice pieces of treasure go to the adventurers.": "角色们应该想出一些办法，在NPC之间分配远征中获得的任何财宝。只要分得合理公平，大多数追随者都会感到满意。但是，如果所有选择的宝物都归冒险者所有，NPC们就会抱怨。",
	"The characters might also need to contend with the problem of theft, whether NPCs stealing from spoils not yet divided, stealing from the adventurers, or stealing from each other. Such theft might be driven by sheer greed, or it could be a manifestation of madness. A bout of long-term madness could easily lead to obsession with particular items of treasure—especially magic items—with an obsessed NPC willing to steal or even kill to obtain them.": "角色们可能还需要面对偷窃的问题，无论是NPC从尚未分到的战利品中偷窃，还是从冒险者那里偷窃，或者是互相偷窃。这种偷窃可能是由纯粹的贪婪驱动的，也可能是一种疯狂的表现。长期的疯狂很容易导致对特定宝物的痴迷--特别是魔法物品--痴迷的NPC愿意去偷窃甚至杀人来获得它们。",
	"The adventurers are in command of their NPC followers, and that means they are responsible for welding together disparate forces and maintaining discipline. The characters have a bit of an advantage in this regard, in that the NPCs placed under their command are all well-trained faction operatives, not raw recruits or mercenaries. However, some of these seasoned personnel might question the right of a ragtag band of adventurers to command them, even if their superiors seem to trust the player characters. Likewise, though the individual factions are typically disciplined within their own ranks, members of any faction might bristle at having to work alongside (much less take orders from) members of other factions.": "冒险家们负责指挥他们的NPC追随者，这意味着他们要负责将不同的部队焊接在一起并维持纪律。这些角色在这方面有一点优势，因为在他们指挥下的NPC都是训练有素的派系特工，而不是生手或雇佣兵。然而，这些经验丰富的人员中的一些人可能会质疑一个破烂不堪的冒险者队伍指挥他们的权利，即使他们的上级似乎信任玩家角色。同样，尽管各个派别在自己的队伍中通常都很有纪律，但任何派别的成员都可能对不得不与其他派别的成员一起工作（更不用说接受他们的命令）感到不满。",
	"In addition to deciding how the expeditionary force is organized and distributed (see \"{@area Marching Orders|396|x}\"), the players must also institute a clear chain of command. One or more of the adventurers might be the field commanders of the expanded party, while others serve as lieutenants. Likewise, the adventurers might appoint some of the NPCs to command positions. Without a clear chain of command, information might not go to the right people, and decisions might not get made quickly enough—or at all. Adding to the challenge of maintaining discipline is the ever-present threat of demonic madness growing among the ranks, creating problems even for seasoned and professional troops (see \"{@area Heart of Darkness|39c|x}\").": "除了决定远征军的组织和分配方式外（见\"{@area Marching Orders|396|x}\"），玩家还必须建立一个明确的指挥系统。一个或多个冒险家可能是扩大的队伍的战地指挥官，而其他人则担任副手。同样地，冒险家们可以任命一些NPC担任指挥职务。如果没有一个明确的指挥系统，信息可能不会传递给正确的人，决定可能不会被迅速做出，或者根本就没有。在维持纪律方面的挑战还包括在队伍中不断增长的恶魔般的疯狂威胁，这甚至给经验丰富的专业部队带来了问题（见\"{@area Heart of Darkness|39c|x}\"）。",
	"If the expeditionary force is made up of diverse factions, the players also need to decide how much latitude to give those factions. For example, Zhentarim mercenaries might be eager to torture prisoners for information unless the characters put a stop to it, and members of the Emerald Enclave might place a higher priority on maintaining the balance of nature in the Underdark than on political struggles.": "如果远征军是由不同的派别组成的，玩家还需要决定给这些派别多少自由度。例如，Zhentarim雇佣兵可能会急于折磨囚犯以获取信息，除非角色们加以制止，而翡翠飞地的成员可能会把维护暗黑世界的自然平衡看得比政治斗争更重要。",
	"You can change up the feel of these later chapters of {@i Out of the Abyss} by allowing the players to take on the roles of their faction allies as well as their regular characters. This can range from letting each player control the overall actions of the NPCs in a single faction, to creating multiple subgroups so that characters can split off and have their own adventures. While this involves a good deal more coordination among the game group, it can add a lot of detail, intrigue, and interaction to the campaign.": "你可以通过让玩家扮演他们的派系盟友以及普通角色，来改变{@i Out of the Abyss}这些后期章节的感觉。这可以从让每个玩家控制一个派别中的NPC的整体行动，到创建多个分组，使角色可以分开并有自己的冒险。虽然这涉及到游戏组之间更多的协调，但它可以为活动增加很多细节、阴谋和互动。",
	"The adventurers must contend with a variety of events as they lead their forces through the Underdark. Every other day of travel or camping in the Underdark, an event automatically occurs. Roll a {@dice d20} and consult the Random Events table, or choose a suitable event.": "冒险家们在带领他们的部队穿越暗黑世界时必须与各种事件作斗争。每隔一天在地下城旅行或露营，就会自动发生一个事件。掷出{@dice d20}并查阅随机事件表，或者选择一个合适的事件。",

	"Outposts not only allow scouts to easily backtrack through the Underdark, carrying messages and information to the characters' allies, but also allow additional supplies and reinforcements to reach the expeditionary force with relative ease.

	"If {@creature Shuushar the Awakened|OotA} (see {@area chapter 1|008|x}) was not killed in a previous chapter of the adventure, the characters find him among Sloobludop's survivors. He is the sole point of calm and reason in the ruined settlement, and the various factions of the kuo-toa show him respect. Shuushar mediates disputes between the kuo-toa and supervises the allocation of their dwindling resources. Even so, the kuo-toa monk isn't sure how long he can sustain his people and keep them from destruction.": "如果{@creature Shuushar the Awakened|OotA}(见{@area chapter 1|008|x})没有在冒险的前一章中被杀，角色们会在Sloobludop的幸存者中找到他。他是废墟上唯一的冷静和理智之处，国土人的各个派别都对他表示尊重。舒沙调解国土人之间的争端，监督他们日益减少的资源的分配。即便如此，这位国土僧人也不确定他能维持他的人民多久，使他们免于毁灭。",
	"If the characters visited Gracklstugh previously, the duergar response to their return is dictated by the gray dwarves' prior experience with the characters. The duergar are cautious—if not downright alarmed—at the sight of an armed expeditionary force from the surface world at their gates. They likely refuse entry to the full party, allowing only a select few characters into the Darklake District. {@condition Invisible} duergar guards keep watch on characters in the city at all times, and might even infiltrate the expeditionary force, attempting to eavesdrop on conversations to learn the adventurers' intentions.": "如果角色以前访问过Gracklstugh，那么灰矮人对他们回来的反应是由灰矮人以前对角色的经验所决定的。当看到一支来自地表世界的武装远征军出现在他们的门前时，杜尔加人很谨慎--如果不是完全惊恐的话。他们可能会拒绝整个队伍进入，只允许少数角色进入黑暗湖区。{@condition Invisible}duergar守卫随时监视着城市中的人物，甚至可能渗透到远征军中，试图偷听他们的谈话，了解冒险者的意图。",
	"The influence of the demon lords grows ever stronger in Gracklstugh. Paranoia and fear are rampant, with duergar barricading themselves in their homes and strongholds, afraid to venture out into the streets—even invisibly. Rumors abound of creatures active in the Darklake, and of secret rituals and offerings made to the dark waters to appease them. A number of foreigners have disappeared, and incoming trade to the city has slowed as outsiders depart or stay away.": "恶魔领主的影响在Gracklstugh越来越强。妄想症和恐惧症猖獗，杜尔加人把自己关在家里和据点里，不敢到街上去冒险--即使是隐形的。关于在黑暗湖中活动的生物的传言比比皆是，还有为安抚它们而向黑暗水域举行的秘密仪式和祭品。一些外国人失踪了，由于外来者离开或远离，进入城市的贸易已经放缓。",
	"Conflict between the Keepers of the Flame and the Gray Ghosts thieves' guild comes to a boil.

	"Whether due to the intervention of the adventurers, the recent events in the Underdark, or both, {@creature Themberchaud|OotA} the Wyrmsmith knows that the Keepers are deliberately oppressing him, and he plots to thin their ranks and weaken their power.

Meanwhile, rumors mount that the drow of Menzoberranzan are behind the demonic incursion. Tales range from the drow raising a mighty army of demons to a summoning spell gone terribly wrong. A demonic rampage is said to have nearly destroyed the City of Spiders, and characters with knowledge of the situation in Menzoberranzan are of great interest to all the factions of Gracklstugh. Any evidence that the drow are responsible for the presence of the demon lords stokes the already blazing embers of animosity against the dark elves, with the more militant factions of Gracklstugh calling for a renewed war of vengeance against Menzoberranzan.": "duergar和derro策划了一个计划，将{@creature Themberchaud|OotA}作为祭品献给Demogorgon，将恶魔王子吸引到他们的城市，并将自己许诺给恶魔王子。他们中的一些人甚至妄想以某种方式束缚或影响恶魔领主的力量，或者恶魔领主将带领他们征服整个地下城。与此同时，有传言说门索布兰赞的乌鸦是恶魔入侵的幕后黑手。传言的范围很广，从鸦人组建强大的恶魔军队到召唤咒语出了大错。据说恶魔的肆虐几乎摧毁了蜘蛛之城，对门索伯兰山的情况有所了解的人物对格拉克尔斯图的所有派别都很感兴趣。任何证明鸦人应对恶魔领主的存在负责的证据都会激起人们对黑暗精灵本已炽热的敌意，Gracklstugh中更激进的派别会呼吁重新对Menzoberranzan展开复仇之战。",

	"Urmas, the Keeper of the Present, is the busiest of all the librarians.

	"Though Urmas is patient, it quickly becomes obvious that he suffers the characters' questions and presence out of duty and politeness, seeking to return to his work as soon as possible.

	"The irruption of the demon lords into the Underdark has sent powerful ripples of indescribable chaos through Ustova's visions. All she sees of the future is fire, blood, and death, shot through with signs and portents based upon the natures of the demon lords—the bloody spirals and twin-forked symbols of Demogorgon, the excessive growth and rot of Zuggtmoy, visions obscured and clouded by the slime of Juiblex, and so on. She gladly helps any characters who can offer clarity in what she is seeing, treating such information as beneficial visions from the dream that is the world outside the Underdark.": "恶魔领主对暗黑世界的入侵，在乌斯托瓦的视野中激起了难以描述的混乱的强大涟漪。她所看到的未来都是火焰、鲜血和死亡，充满了基于恶魔领主的性质的迹象和预兆--德摩根的血腥螺旋和双叉标志，祖格莫伊的过度生长和腐烂，被朱布莱克斯的粘液遮蔽和蒙蔽的愿景，等等。她很乐意帮助任何能够为她所看到的东西提供清晰度的角色，将这些信息视为来自地下世界之外的梦境的有益幻觉。",

	"Reading the tablets in these archives provides a good overview of what is going on in the Underdark at the present time. The latest news has a delay of a few days and is often incomplete, becoming more detailed as Urmas obtains more information from his messengers and informants. The reports about the demons' invasion are sketchy and incomplete, but characters can still get a rough idea about which demon lord arrived where. They can learn that Zuggtmoy might be on the move to an undisclosed location, or follow the ravaging paths of Yeenoghu and Baphomet as they gather and rally the races that worship them. Unlike the bits and pieces of news about the other demon lords, a significant amount of information is known about the cults of Demogorgon festering under Gracklstugh, as events there directly affect the resident stone giant clan.": "阅读这些档案中的石板可以很好地了解目前暗黑世界的情况。最新的消息有几天的延迟，而且往往是不完整的，随着乌尔玛斯从他的信使和线人那里获得更多的信息而变得更加详细。关于恶魔入侵的报告是粗略的、不完整的，但人物仍然可以大致了解哪个恶魔领主到达了哪里。他们可以了解到Zuggtmoy可能正在向一个未公开的地点移动，或者跟随Yeenoghu和Baphomet的蹂躏路线，因为他们聚集和召集了崇拜他们的种族。与其他恶魔领主的零星消息不同的是，关于在格拉克尔斯图格地下发酵的德摩根教派的大量信息是已知的，因为那里的事件直接影响到常驻的石巨人部族。",

See chapter 12, \"{@adventure The Tower of Vengeance|OotA|11},\" for more information about Araj.": "人物可以与{@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA|Vizeran}一起旅行，如果他们想先处理暗黑世界的其他事务，他也会为他们提供地图和精确的方向，引导他们去Araj。他强调说，时间是最重要的。人物每耽搁一天，恶魔领主在暗黑世界的权力和影响力就会增加。关于Araj的更多信息，请参见第12章\"{@adventure The Tower of Vengeance|OotA|11}\"。",
	"The last favor the library provides for the adventurers is to have the tunnel out directly connect with routes leading to the characters' desired destination, whether that destination is Araj, Blingdenstone, Menzoberranzan, Gracklstugh, Mantol-Derith, the edge of the Darklake, or somewhere else.": "图书馆为冒险者提供的最后一个好处是，让隧道出来直接与通往人物所期望的目的地的路线相连，无论这个目的地是Araj、Blingdenstone、Menzoberranzan、Gracklstugh、Mantol-Derith、黑暗湖的边缘，还是其他地方。",
	"The characters should leave Gravenhollow with a clear picture of what is happening in the Underdark under the influence of the demon lords, and the roles that Gromph Baenre and Lolth have played in creating the crisis.

	"Offered an alliance by the drow archmage {@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA}, the adventurers travel to his tower in the depths of the Underdark. There, they learn more about what he knows of the threat posed by the demon lords—and potentially forge a pact with him to deal with that threat. They must be cautious, however, as their potential ally has his own interests at heart and his own agenda where his fellow drow are concerned.": "鸦人大法师{@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA}提出要与他们结盟，冒险者们前往他在暗黑世界深处的塔楼。在那里，他们了解到更多关于他对恶魔领主所构成的威胁的认识--并有可能与他签订协议来应对这一威胁。然而，他们必须谨慎，因为他们的潜在盟友心里有自己的利益，在涉及到他的同胞乌鸦时有自己的计划。",
	"If the characters rebuffed Vizeran's overtures to an alliance in Gravenhollow (see {@area chapter 11|40e|x}), the drow archmage subsequently sends Grin Ousstyl (see later in this chapter) as a peace envoy, renewing the offer and leading the characters to Araj if they accept it. Further exploration of the Underdark on their own might convince the adventurers to at least hear what Vizeran has to say. If they find the means to communicate his offer to their allies on the surface world, those allies encourage the characters to forge an alliance with the drow archmage.": "如果角色们拒绝了维泽兰在格雷文霍尔（Gravenhollow）提出的结盟建议（见{@area chapter 11|40e|x}），那么鸦人大法师随后会派格林-奥斯提尔（Grin Ousstyl）（见本章后面）作为和平使者，重新提出建议，如果角色们接受的话，会把他们带到阿拉杰。对暗黑世界的进一步探索可能会说服冒险者们至少听听维泽兰的意见。如果他们找到方法将他的提议传达给他们在地面世界的盟友，这些盟友就会鼓励人物与乌鸦大法师建立联盟。",
	"Vizeran's tower lies on the edge of the Wormwrithings, about ten days from Menzoberranzan. The map and directions the archmage provides the adventurers in {@area chapter 11|40e|x} allow them to find the cavern where the tower stands without getting lost.

	"The final stretch to reach the tower is through a narrow passage off a side tunnel, concealed by a magically protected secret door. If Vizeran's map comes within 10 feet of the door, soft purple light outlines the word \"Araj\"—a drow word for \"vengeance\"—across its surface in spidery Elvish script. Touching the map to the door causes it to open for 1 minute or until the map is more than 100 feet away from it. If the characters travel with Vizeran, the secret door opens on his command.": "到达塔楼的最后一段路是通过侧边隧道的一条狭窄通道，被一扇受魔法保护的暗门掩盖。如果维泽兰的地图靠近门10英尺以内，柔和的紫光就会在其表面勾勒出 \"Araj \"这个词--一个代表 \"复仇 \"的乌鸦词--用蜘蛛网状的精灵文字书写。将地图碰触到门上会导致门在1分钟内打开，或者直到地图离门超过100英尺。如果人物与维泽兰一起旅行，秘门会在他的命令下打开。",
	"The adventurers can travel to Araj with the full complement of their expeditionary force. Vizeran allows only the player characters within the tower, though the cavern around it offers space to camp and no risk of encounters.

	"The passage behind the secret door is narrow enough that you need to move through it single file, occasionally turning sideways to squeeze. It takes about an hour to navigate its pitch-black darkness, and the journey is filled with a constant echo of distant sounds. The passage then widens, opening out into a cavern whose far walls and ceiling are out of sight in the darkness. Bits of quartz and mica in the stone glimmer as they catch the light, showing a footpath worn into the stone floor. At the end of that path, a vast, dark shape rises—an enormous stalagmite carved into a bleak, black tower.": "秘密门后的通道很窄，你需要单行通过，偶尔要侧着身子挤一挤。在黑漆漆的黑暗中穿行大约需要一个小时，旅途中不断有远处的声音回响。然后通道变宽，打开了一个洞穴，在黑暗中看不到远处的墙壁和天花板。石头中的石英和云母碎片在光线下闪闪发光，显示出一条磨在石板上的脚印。在这条路的尽头，一个巨大的、黑暗的形状升起--一个巨大的石笋被雕刻成一个凄凉的黑色塔。",
	"Vizeran's tower is a enormous stalagmite, carved with a spiraling series of chambers leading up to its peak. The center of the stone spike is hollowed out to form an open vertical shaft.

Characters can climb the stairs if they wish, but any creature that steps past the stairs and into the open shaft activates a magical levitation effect imbued into the shaft (see the \"Vizeran's Tower: General Features\" sidebar).

Unfortunately for him, his rise to power came at the same time as one of the other great arcane talents of the City of Spiders, Gromph Baenre. A scion of the First House and as gifted a schemer as he is a mage, Gromph engineered Vizeran's disgrace and exile as an unbeliever in Lolth. Ironically, this might have saved Vizeran's life, as House DeVir was wiped out not long thereafter by its rival, House Do'Urden.": "{@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA}是鸦人城市Menzoberranzan产生的最伟大的魔法人才之一。不幸的是，他的权力崛起与蜘蛛城其他伟大的魔法人才之一，格罗姆夫-贝恩雷同时出现。作为第一家族的后裔，格罗姆夫是个有天赋的阴谋家，他设计了维泽兰的耻辱，并将其作为洛尔兹的不信者流放。讽刺的是，这可能救了维泽兰的命，因为德维尔家族不久后就被它的对手杜尔登家族消灭了。",
	"Consigned to solitude in the Underdark, Vizeran didn't perish as most assumed he would. Instead, he put his arcane powers to work to create a safe haven for himself, and spent the following centuries in isolated study, furthering his mastery of the magical arts. He has watched from afar as countless events unfolded in the Underdark and across Faerûn, gathering information and making plans for his eventual return. After waiting for centuries, Vizeran now believes that time has come.": "维泽兰被安排在暗黑世界中孤独地生活，但他并没有像大多数人认为的那样灭亡。相反，他把他的奥术力量用于为自己创造一个安全的避风港，并在接下来的几个世纪里与世隔绝地学习，进一步掌握了魔法艺术。他从远处看着无数事件在暗黑世界和整个法鲁恩展开，收集信息并为他最终的回归制定计划。在等待了几个世纪之后，维泽兰现在相信时机已经到来。",
	"Vizeran harbors a thirst for vengeance against his only living rival—Gromph Baenre, the drow Archmage of Menzoberranzan. As a follower of the Elder Elemental Eye, Vizeran also despises Lolth and her influence over the drow.

Of course, he also wants to learn whatever arcane secrets have allowed Gromph to tap into magic powerful enough to summon the demon lords to the Underdark.": "维泽兰对他唯一活着的对手--门索贝兰赞的乌鸦大法师罗夫-贝恩雷（Gromph Baenre）怀有复仇的渴望。作为长老元素之眼的追随者，维泽兰也鄙视洛尔思和她对乌鸦的影响。他最想做的就是让格罗姆夫现身，向乌鸦证明洛尔思利用他们为自己谋利。当然，他也想知道是什么奥术秘密让格罗姆夫能够挖掘出强大的魔法，足以将恶魔领主召唤到地下世界。",
	"Vizeran makes a powerful but dangerous ally. His plans and goals are entirely self serving, and he will sacrifice the characters without hesitation to further his schemes.

Vizeran dismisses any questions about such matters, but Grin Ousstyl confides to the characters that Vizeran once kept bound minor demons and humanoid slaves in his service. Vizeran banished the demons with the arrival of the demon lords in the Underdark, fearing some hidden connection between the creatures of the Abyss. The slaves held by the drow archmage (most of them acquired from Gracklstugh) are all dead—either lost to madness and killed by Vizeran, or sacrificed as part of the preparations for the archmage's dark ritual.

	"\"The only one of my kind who could ever match me in the Art is Gromph Baenre. I think we knew from the moment we met that we were destined to be rivals. But where I sought only to master the Art, Gromph was also an astute political manipulator. No more devout than I in the service of the Spider Queen, he arranged for my disgrace and exile. Deprived of my considerable skills, my house fell to our rival, House Do'Urden. Gromph became the Archmage of Menzoberranzan under the auspices of his own house, the First House of the Ruling Council.": "\"我的同类中唯一能在艺术方面与我匹敌的是格罗夫-巴恩雷。我想从我们相遇的那一刻起，我们就知道我们注定要成为对手。但我只追求掌握艺术，而格罗夫也是一个精明的政治操纵者。在为蜘蛛女王服务方面，他并不比我更虔诚，他安排了我的羞辱和流放。由于失去了我的大量技能，我的家族落入了我们的对手多乌尔登家族手中。格罗姆夫在他自己的家族--执政委员会第一家族的支持下，成为了门索伯兰赞的大法师。",
	"\"Gromph and I only ever had two things in common: our passion for the Art, and our hatred of the manner in which our fellow mages suffer at the hands of the matron mothers and mistresses of the drow.

	"Long ago, the Labyrinth was much like any other part of the Underdark, consisting largely of natural caverns connected by tunnels and underground rivers. The discovery of precious metals and gemstones led dwarves and others to excavate, extending its tunnels and expanding its caves. The results of those efforts saw an insignificant corner of the Underdark transformed into a vast, sprawling network of passages.": "很久以前，迷宫和暗黑世界的其他地方一样，主要由隧道和地下河连接的天然洞穴组成。贵重金属和宝石的发现促使矮人和其他人进行挖掘，延长隧道并扩大洞穴。这些努力的结果是，暗黑世界的一个微不足道的角落变成了一个巨大的、蔓延的通道网络。",
	"Abandoned settlements within the Labyrinth are common, marked out by rusting iron rails and scattered ore carts. Dark mine shafts descend into the unknown depths, while tunnels stretch off in random directions. Rifts both small and large also appear throughout. Many a tunnel ends abruptly at a rift, as if the way ahead was simply sheared off to leave a vast, yawning chasm. Some of these rifts run to depths of a few hundred feet. Others ascend and descend for miles. Many of the rifts show their age by the presence of carved switchback staircases along their walls, or weathered bridges spanning their gaps.": "迷宫内被遗弃的定居点很常见，由生锈的铁轨和散落的矿车标示出来。黑暗的矿井下沉到未知的深处，而隧道则向随机方向延伸。大大小小的裂缝也到处出现。许多隧道在裂缝处戛然而止，仿佛前面的路被剪断了，留下一个巨大的、打着哈欠的鸿沟。这些裂缝有的深达几百英尺。其他的则上升和下降了数英里。许多裂缝显示出它们的年龄，因为它们的墙壁上有雕刻好的回旋楼梯，或有风化的桥梁横跨其间隙。",
	"Characters in the Labyrinth can easily become lost.

The command word to open the front door or the trap door on the roof is \"mimsy.\" The command word to transform the tower into a one-inch metal cube is \"brillig,\" but speaking it has no effect since the shadow demons are still inside. To return the tower to its cube form, the adventurers must first empty it of any creatures.": "一个角色可以通过对塔施展{@spell identify}的法术来学习塔的命令语。打开前门或屋顶上的活板门的命令词是 \"mimsy\"。把塔变成一个一英寸的金属立方体的命令词是 \"brillig\"，但说出来没有效果，因为影魔还在里面。要让塔回到立方体的形态，冒险家们必须首先清空塔中的任何生物。",

	"Modrons have no sense of individuality. They are a collective and refer to themselves as \"we\" or \"us.\" As a result, modrons don't understand individuality in others.

Success indicates that the character recalls stories about the Great Modron March, which occurs every 289 years and sees a vast army of modrons marching across the Outer Planes. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character also knows the last march happened over two hundred years ago, and that these modrons are likely remnants of that march. The tridrone doesn't admit this (not wanting to acknowledge its failure), though it might be convinced to follow the characters if they offer to lead the modrons out of the Labyrinth. Additionally, the tridrone knows the Labyrinth well, and befriending the modrons grants characters a +5 bonus to Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) checks made to navigate the region.": "一旦确信了角色的友好意图，三头龙就会告诉他们，它和它的伙伴们正在执行一项极其重要的任务，尽管它并没有透露这项任务的性质。角色可以通过进行DC20智力({@skill Arcana})检查来弄清摩德隆人可能在这里的原因。成功表明该角色想起了关于莫德隆大进军的故事，这个故事每289年发生一次，看到一支庞大的莫德隆军队在外星系中行进。如果检查成功5个或更多，该角色还知道上一次行军发生在两百多年前，而这些莫德隆人很可能是那次行军的残余。三角龙并不承认这一点（不想承认自己的失败），不过如果角色提出要带领莫德隆人离开迷宫，它可能会被说服而跟随他们。此外，三头龙对迷宫非常熟悉，与莫德隆人交好，可以使人物在浏览该地区时获得+5的智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查奖励。",
	"The tridrone warns the characters to avoid the center of the Labyrinth, explaining that a malfunctioning \"Orderer\" is there. The characters might know the device by its other name: the Maze Engine. Because the device was built on Mechanus, its magical energy resonates with the modrons. The tridrone explains that an Orderer is designed to bring order to chaos by altering reality. A malfunctioning Orderer can be very dangerous, however, altering reality in unexpected ways. The tridrone knows exactly how far it is from the device. Because its knowledge of magic is limited and its focus on rejoining the Great Modron March is all-consuming, the tridrone has never thought about whether the Orderer might provide a solution to the modrons' predicament. If the characters express an interest in investigating this possibility, the tridrone leads the party to the center of the Labyrinth where the Maze Engine is found.": "三角龙警告人物要避开迷宫的中心，并解释说那里有一个发生故障的 \"订购者\"。人物可能知道这个装置的另一个名字：迷宫引擎。因为这个装置是在麦金努斯上建造的，它的魔法能量与莫德隆人产生了共鸣。三角龙解释说，\"秩序者 \"的目的是通过改变现实，将秩序带到混乱之中。然而，一个发生故障的 \"秩序者 \"可能非常危险，会以意想不到的方式改变现实。三角龙清楚地知道它离设备有多远。因为它对魔法的了解有限，而且它对重新加入伟大的莫德隆行军的关注是全神贯注的，所以tridrone从来没有想过秩序者是否可以为莫德隆人的困境提供一个解决方案。如果角色们表示有兴趣调查这种可能性，三头龙就会带领大家去迷宫的中心，那里有迷宫引擎。",

Alternatively, if the characters are indecisive or spend too long debating the best course of action, the gnoll pack lord sniffs out the intruders. When it realizes that enemies are present, the pack lord howls to draw the attention of its followers.": "如果角色想继续前进，就需要对付地精和鬣狗。或者，如果角色优柔寡断，或者花了太多时间争论最佳行动方案，地精群主就会嗅出入侵者。当它意识到有敌人存在时，狼群领主就会嚎叫以吸引其追随者的注意。",
	"If you'd like Yeenoghu to play more of a role in this chapter of the adventure, it's easy to do so. When the gnolls killed by the characters do not rejoin the hunt, the demon lord circles back to the site of the goristro's demise and discovers his slain minions—and also picks up the scent of the adventurers.": "如果你想让耶诺古在这一章的冒险中扮演更多的角色，这很容易做到。当被角色杀死的地精没有重新加入狩猎时，恶魔领主回到了地精死亡的地方，发现了他被杀死的部下--同时也发现了冒险者的气味。",
	"Later in the adventure, Yeenoghu hunts down the characters to make them pay for their impudence (ideally when they are much higher in level). Before the final confrontation, give the characters hints that they have become the demon lord's prey. They might face an increasing number of gnoll ambushes, for example. One or more of their attackers might refer to them as \"prey of Yeenoghu,\" or otherwise taunt them by speaking of their impending doom.": "在冒险的后期，Yeenoghu会追捕这些角色，让他们为自己的无耻行为付出代价（最好是在他们等级更高的时候）。在最后的对抗之前，给角色们一些暗示，告诉他们已经成为恶魔领主的猎物。例如，他们可能会面临越来越多的地精的伏击。一个或多个攻击者可能会称他们为 \"耶诺古的猎物\"，或者以其他方式嘲弄他们，说他们即将面临厄运。",
	"Another tunnel on the opposite side of the cavern heads off in a different direction than where Yeenoghu led his pack. Characters who defeat the remaining gnolls can continue on their way without losing any more time.": "洞穴对面的另一条隧道的方向与叶诺古带领他的队伍的方向不同。打败剩下的地精的角色可以继续上路，不会再失去任何时间。",
	"The close brush with Yeenoghu pays dividends to the adventurers by delivering two components of Vizeran's ritual into their hands. The first is the heart of the goristro, which the characters can remove from its corpse. The massive heart is the size of a small trunk and weighs nearly one hundred pounds. Any characters close to it while it is being transported imagine that they can occasionally hear it beating. A character who carries the heart, even in a {@item bag of holding} or similar extradimensional space, makes saving throws against madness with disadvantage.": "与耶诺古的亲密接触给冒险者们带来了好处，他们将维泽兰仪式的两个组成部分交到了自己手中。第一个是大猩猩的心脏，人物可以从它的尸体上取出来。这颗巨大的心脏有一个小树干那么大，重达近百磅。在运送过程中，任何靠近它的角色都可以想象到他们偶尔可以听到它的跳动。携带这颗心脏的角色，即使是在{@item bag of holding}或类似的次元空间中，也会对疯狂进行不利的拯救。",
	"The second component takes the form of a few spatters of a demon lord's blood. A successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check finds some of Yeenoghu's black blood on the fallen goristro's horns.": "第二种成分是一些恶魔领主的血液喷溅。成功通过DC10智慧({@skill Perception})检查后，可以在倒下的戈里斯特的角上发现一些耶诺古的黑血。",
	"This cavern lies deep inside the Labyrinth and contains another ritual component that Vizeran needs.": "这个洞穴位于迷宫的深处，里面有维泽兰需要的另一个仪式组件。",
	"The passage you follow climbs upward as it corkscrews through stone, finally emerging through the floor of a large cavern. The ceiling arches sixty feet overhead, bristling with stalactites that drip water onto stalagmites rising from the uneven and broken floor. Here and there between the stalagmites, several statues of winged humanoids are set in poses of suffering and anguish. Some cover their faces, while others claw at them. Others reach toward the ceiling, their faces twisted into expressions of longing.": "你所遵循的通道在石缝中不断向上攀升，最后穿过一个大洞穴的地板出现。天花板在头顶上拱起60英尺，上面布满了钟乳石，这些钟乳石将水滴在从不平整的破碎地板上升起的石笋上。在石笋之间，有几座长着翅膀的人形雕像，摆出了痛苦的姿势。有些人捂着脸，有些人则用爪子抓着脸。其他人则伸向天花板，他们的脸扭曲成渴望的表情。",
	"The angels can communicate, albeit in a limited fashion, with living creatures that touch them.": "天使可以与接触他们的生物沟通，尽管是以有限的方式。",
	"A character who makes physical contact with an angel (even through gloves or some other protective covering) knows that angel's name and experiences the effect described below. If you wish, you can roll a {@dice d8} to determine which angel a character touches, rerolling any repeat results. Unless specified otherwise, the effect is instantaneous. While there's no limit to the number of creatures that can touch an angel and be affected by it, a creature that touches an angel and triggers its effect can't trigger that particular angel's effect again until 24 hours have elapsed.": "一个与天使有身体接触的角色（即使是通过手套或其他保护性的覆盖物）知道那个天使的名字，并经历下面描述的效果。如果你愿意，你可以掷出{@dice d8}来决定一个角色接触到哪个天使，重掷任何重复的结果。除非另有规定，否则效果是瞬间的。虽然对能够触及天使并受其影响的生物数量没有限制，但触及天使并触发其效果的生物在24小时之前不能再次触发该特定天使的效果。",
	"This angel reaches toward the ceiling, its face a mask of hatred. A creature that makes contact with this angel must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking {@dice 3d6} psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.": "这个天使伸向天花板，它的脸是仇恨的面具。与这个天使接触的生物必须做一个DC15的智慧救赎，救赎失败会受到{@dice 3d6}精神伤害，救赎成功会受到一半的伤害。",
	"While the character is {@condition charmed}, the angel has a telepathic link with the character as long as it and the character remain on the same plane of existence. The angel issues commands to the character, and the character does its best to obey those commands if it is conscious. The angel typically commands a character to kill, maim, rob, or otherwise harm its companions.": "当角色处于{@condition charmed}时，只要它和角色保持在同一个存在平面上，天使就与角色有心灵感应的联系。天使向角色发出命令，如果角色有意识的话，它就会尽力服从这些命令。天使通常会命令角色杀死、残害、抢劫或以其他方式伤害其同伴。",
	"Each time an affected character takes damage, he or she makes a new Charisma saving throw against the effect. If the saving throw succeeds, the effect on it ends.": "每当受影响的角色受到伤害时，他或她就会对该效果进行一次新的魅力储蓄。如果蓄力投掷成功，对其的影响就会结束。",
	"This angel stands feet apart, head downcast, arms at its sides. A character making contact with the angel hears a soft voice say in Common, \"Do not lose hope.\" The character's next Wisdom saving throw is made with advantage.": "这个天使双脚分开站立，低着头，双臂放在身旁。与天使接触的角色听到一个柔和的声音用普通话说：\"不要失去希望。\" 该角色的下一个智慧救赎动作是有优势的。",
	"This angel holds its hands to its face, concealing its visage. Upon making contact with this angel, the character hears a soft voice repeating two words over and over in the Celestial language: \"Kill me.\" There is no obvious way for the characters to do so, however. The voice persists even if the angel is shattered.": "这个天使用手遮住脸，掩盖了它的面容。与这个天使接触后，角色会听到一个柔和的声音，用天体语言一遍又一遍地重复两个词。\"杀了我\"。然而，人物没有明显的方法来这样做。即使这个天使被击碎，这个声音也会持续存在。",
	"This angel kneels on the floor and buries its face in its arms. A character making contact with the angel hears a soft voice say in Common, \"What would you know? Ask and I shall answer.\" The character must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the character takes {@dice 3d6} psychic damage and gains one level of madness. On a success, the character can ask two questions. The angel replies as if the character had successfully cast the {@spell contact other plane} spell.": "这个天使跪在地上，把脸埋在怀里。一个与天使接触的角色听到一个柔和的声音用普通话说：\"你想知道什么？问吧，我将回答你。该角色必须做一个DC15智力救赎的动作。如果拯救失败，角色会受到0%的精神伤害，并获得一级的疯狂。成功后，角色可以问两个问题。天使的回答就像角色成功施展了{@spell contact other plane}的法术一样。",
	"This angel claws at its eyes, and its face appears torn and rent. When a character makes contact with the angel, it invites the character to ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within seven days. The angel replies as if the character had successfully cast the {@spell divination} spell.": "这个天使用爪子抓着它的眼睛，它的脸出现了撕裂和撕裂。当角色与天使接触时，它邀请角色问一个关于特定目标、事件或七天内发生的活动的单一问题。天使的回答就像角色成功施展了{@spell divination}的法术一样。",
	"The adventurers can chisel or break off stone feathers from the angels' wings. One each from six different angels fulfills the requirements for Vizeran's ritual, although characters can take more feathers if they want.": "冒险家们可以从天使的翅膀上凿出或折下石质羽毛。从六个不同的天使身上各取一根，就能满足维泽兰仪式的要求，当然，如果他们愿意，角色可以取更多的羽毛。",
	"Other creatures in the Labyrinth avoid this cavern, making it a safe place for the party to take a long rest.": "迷宫中的其他生物会避开这个洞穴，使之成为一行人长期休息的安全场所。",
	"Deep within the Labyrinth lies the Maze Engine—a mechanical, magically powered device capable of altering reality. Modrons refer to the device as an Orderer because it was designed is to bring order to chaos. If the characters activate the Maze Engine, it has the potential to aid their fight against the demon lords.": "在迷宫的深处有一个迷宫引擎--一个机械的、以魔法为动力的装置，能够改变现实。摩德隆人把这个装置称为 \"秩序者\"，因为它的设计是为了给混乱带来秩序。如果角色们激活了迷宫引擎，它就有可能帮助他们与恶魔领主作战。",
	"The engine looks like a working model of the Great Wheel (see chapter 2, \"{@book Creating a Multiverse|DMG|2|The Great Wheel},\" in the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}). It's a 20-foot-diameter sphere built of 1-foot-wide bands of magically hardened and shaped bronze, engraved with arcane symbols. Gaps in the bands show various gears and articulation arms within the sphere, which rotate and shift to represent the relationships between the various known planes of existence.": "这个引擎看起来像是大轮盘的工作模型（见第二章，\"{@book Creating a Multiverse|DMG|2|The Great Wheel}，\"在{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}）。它是一个直径20英尺的球体，由1英尺宽的经过魔法硬化和塑形的青铜带构成，上面刻有神秘的符号。带子上的缝隙显示了球体中的各种齿轮和衔接臂，它们的旋转和移动代表了各种已知存在平面之间的关系。",
	"Characters might learn about the existence of the Maze Engine from the beholder Karazikar (see {@area chapter 13|47e|x}) or from Vizeran, who has heard rumors about an ancient reality-altering device. Characters might also learn about the engine from Karazikar's modron prisoner or from the modrons lost in the Labyrinth (see \"{@area March to Nowhere|4b5|x}\").": "角色可能会从看守者卡拉兹卡尔（见{@area chapter 13|47e|x}）或从维泽兰那里得知迷宫引擎的存在，维泽兰听到了关于一个改变现实的古老装置的传言。角色也可能从卡拉兹卡尔的莫德隆囚犯或迷失在迷宫中的莫德隆那里了解到这个引擎（见\"{@area March to Nowhere|4b5|x}\"）。",
	"Located forty-eight miles southeast of the Gallery of Angels, the Maze Engine is wedged halfway down a 20-foot-wide, 100-foot-deep crevasse located in the middle of a large cavern. The bottom of the crevasse is filled with magma. A shimmering curtain of heat rises from the crevasse and makes the cavern hot and dry.": "迷宫引擎位于天使长廊东南48英里处，它被夹在位于一个大洞穴中间的20英尺宽、100英尺深的裂缝中的一半。裂缝的底部充满了岩浆。一道闪闪发光的热帘从裂缝中升起，使洞穴变得又热又干。",
	"Having just recently found the Maze Engine, Baphomet has set a {@creature nalfeshnee} named Slaughtertusk to watch over the crevasse and prevent any creature from approaching the device. Slaughtertusk would rather be helping the Horned King track down and kill Yeenoghu. The nalfeshnee is bored with its assigned task, although it knows better than to disobey the Horned King. Still, rather than immediately destroying any intruders, it toys with them for as long as possible.": "巴弗灭最近刚刚发现了迷宫引擎，他设置了一个名为Slaughtertusk的{@creature nalfeshnee}来监视这个裂缝，防止任何生物接近这个装置。Slaughtertusk宁愿帮助角王追踪并杀死Yeenoghu。纳尔费斯内对它被指派的任务感到厌烦，尽管它知道最好不要违抗角王的命令。不过，它没有立即消灭任何入侵者，而是尽可能长时间地与他们玩耍。",
	"Slaughtertusk is happy to let a fight drag on, feasting on its enemies' pain before finally slaying them. If reduced to fewer than 100 hit points, it uses its Summon Demon feature (see the \"Variant: Demon Summoning\" sidebar in the \"Demons\" entry of the {@i Monster Manual}) and tries to summon {@dice 1d6} {@creature Vrock||vrocks}.

On its turn during round 13, the Maze Engine sinks into the magma and is destroyed.": "从第9轮开始的每个回合结束时，迷宫引擎会沿着裂缝滑下，每回合向岩浆方向下降10英尺。引擎上的任何生物在每次下降时都必须成功地进行DC15灵巧救赎，以避免被抛下。如上所述，解决这些影响。在第13轮的回合中，迷宫引擎沉入岩浆中并被摧毁。",

	"Zuggtmoy, Demon Queen of Fungi, plots to \"wed\" Araumycos, an enormous fungus occupying a large area of the Underdark. After uniting their powers in an unholy mockery of matrimony—in truth, a demonic rite of domination—Zuggtmoy will gain the power to transform the whole of the Underdark into her new Abyssal domain. The only things in her way are a core of resistance in the myconid community, the rage of her rival Juiblex, and the determination of the adventurers.": "菌类的恶魔女王Zuggtmoy计划与占据暗黑世界大片区域的巨大菌类Araumycos \"结婚\"。在将他们的力量结合在一起，进行一场邪恶的模拟婚礼--实际上是一场恶魔的统治仪式--之后，Zuggtmoy将获得将整个地下城变成她的新深渊领域的力量。挡在她面前的只有菌类社区的抵抗核心，她的对手Juiblex的愤怒，以及冒险家们的决心。",
	"The characters receive a warning about Zuggtmoy's plans from Basidia, one of the myconid sovereigns of Neverlight Grove. After traveling to the caverns of Araumycos, they reach out to Araumycos's alien mind with the aid of Basidia's rapport spores, and try to free it from Zuggtmoy's demonic influence. Juiblex seizes the opportunity to crash the wedding, and the two demon lords do battle. When the characters sever Zuggtmoy's link with Araumycos, Juiblex destroys her material form, leaving the adventurers to face the remaining (and weakened) demon lord in battle.": "角色们从永光丛林的菌类统治者之一Basidia那里收到了关于Zuggtmoy计划的警告。在前往Araumycos的洞穴后，他们借助Basidia的默契孢子接触到Araumycos的异形思维，并试图将其从Zuggtmoy的恶魔影响中解救出来。Juiblex抓住这个机会破坏了婚礼，两个恶魔领主展开了战斗。当角色们切断了祖格莫伊与阿劳米科斯的联系时，尤布勒克斯摧毁了她的物质形态，让冒险者们在战斗中面对剩下的（弱化的）恶魔领主。",
	"The adventurers become caught up in Zuggtmoy's plots when they experience a vision from the rebel myconids of Neverlight Grove, delivered by {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA}. The characters know of Basidia and the myconids' struggles if they visited Neverlight Grove (see {@area chapter 5|224|x}).

	"A soft, glowing light rises from ahead, emanating from a vast cavern. The entire surface of the cave—floor, walls, and ceiling—is blanketed in moss and fungi, all in shades of white and soft pastels of pink, violet, green, and pale blue. The diffuse light the mushrooms shed makes the vista waver as if seen through mist.": "一道柔和的光亮从前方升起，从一个巨大的洞穴里发出。洞穴的整个表面--地板、墙壁和天花板--都被苔藓和真菌所覆盖，都是白色和柔和的粉色、紫色、绿色和淡蓝色的色调。蘑菇散发出的漫射光使视野变得模糊不清，就像透过薄雾看到的一样。",
	"\"Araumycos,\" a voice says in your mind. You turn and see a myconid sovereign standing beside you where there was no one before, recognizing Basidia of Neverlight Grove. \"The largest and greatest being of our world,\" the myconid says sadly. \"All that you see before you is Araumycos; all this and much more. All is in danger from the corruption that will claim the whole of the world if you do not help us.\"": "\"Araumycos，\"一个声音在你心里说。你转过身来，看到一个霉菌君主站在你身边，之前没有人，他认出了永光丛林的巴西迪亚。\"我们世界上最大的、最伟大的存在，\"这个菌人悲伤地说道。\"在你面前看到的都是Araumycos；所有这些以及更多。如果你不帮助我们，所有的一切都处于危险之中，因为腐败将夺走整个世界。\"",
	"Fortunately, there is hope. Basidia believes it can assist in creating a rapport between the adventurers and Araumycos's vast, sleeping mind. The characters can help to awaken it and aid its struggle against the demon queen's influence. Or, if there's no other choice, they can destroy Araumycos before Zuggtmoy can claim the great creature as her own.": "幸运的是，还有希望。Basidia相信它可以协助在冒险者和Araumycos巨大的、沉睡的心灵之间建立一种默契。这些角色可以帮助唤醒它，帮助它与恶魔女王的影响作斗争。或者，如果没有其他选择，他们可以在祖格莫伊将这个伟大的生物据为己有之前摧毁阿劳米科斯。",
	"If {@creature Stool|OotA} or {@creature Rumpadump|OotA} have met the characters and are still alive, they join the rapport between Basidia and the characters, offering their support and encouragement as they implore the adventurers to intervene. If the characters saw the hideous Garden of Welcome in Neverlight Grove—or, worse yet, glimpsed the horrors of Yggmorgus—the myconids remind them that the whole world might become like that if Zuggtmoy unites Araumycos's power with her own.": "如果{@creature Stool|OotA}或{@creature Rumpadump|OotA}遇到了这些角色并且还活着，他们就会加入巴西迪亚和这些角色之间的融洽关系，在恳求冒险者进行干预的同时提供他们的支持和鼓励。如果角色们在永光丛林看到了可怕的欢迎花园，或者更糟糕的是，瞥见了Yggmorgus的恐怖，那么菌类就会提醒他们，如果扎格莫伊将阿劳米科斯的力量与自己的力量结合起来，整个世界都可能变成那样。",
	"Basidia proposes that the characters travel quickly to Araumycos, where the myconid sovereign will temporarily immunize them against the effects of the demon-tainted spores released by myconids under Zuggtmoy's influence. Basidia will then initiate a rapport with Araumycos while Zuggtmoy and her followers are preoccupied with the wedding ceremony.": "Basidia建议这些人物迅速前往Araumycos，在那里，霉菌君主将暂时免疫他们，使他们免受Zuggtmoy影响下的霉菌所释放的被恶魔污染的孢子的影响。然后，当祖格莫伊和她的追随者忙于婚礼仪式时，巴西迪亚将开始与阿劳米科斯建立起关系。",
	"Basidia and its followers can meet the adventurers within Araumycos's vast cavern complex. The sovereign is too closely watched to slip away and meet them before that, and it recommends that the characters avoid contact with other myconids on their travels. Basidia can use the extended rapport link to fix on the characters' location, and promises to find them when they are near the center of Araumycos. The vision then ends.": "Basidia和它的追随者可以在Araumycos的巨大洞穴群中与冒险者见面。主权者受到严密监视，无法在此之前溜走和他们见面，它建议人物在旅行中避免与其他菌类接触。Basidia可以使用扩展的关系链来确定人物的位置，并承诺在他们接近Araumycos的中心时找到他们。幻象随后结束。",
	"Shortly after the party receives Basidia's vision and warning, myconids and fungal creatures throughout the Underdark fall under the influence of Zuggtmoy's spreading spores, making a slow and steady march toward Araumycos, their \"queen's betrothed.\" Thousands are on the move, and the procession has a bizarrely festive air, the fungi capering, dancing, and skipping as they celebrate the impending nuptials.": "在党派收到巴西迪亚的愿景和警告后不久，整个暗黑世界的菌类和真菌生物都受到了祖格莫伊扩散的孢子的影响，缓慢而稳定地向着他们的 \"女王的未婚夫 \"阿劳米科斯行进。成千上万的人在移动，游行队伍有一种奇怪的节日气氛，真菌们在庆祝即将到来的婚礼时跳着舞，跳舞，跳跃。",
	"That behavior alone is alarming enough. However, under the demon queen's influence, the myconids and other fungi release clouds of spores as they move through the tunnels of the Underdark. Strange perfumes and scents fill the air. The marching myconids sow chaos as they move through the Underdark, passing around the Darklake. Other intelligent Underdark creatures give the procession a wide berth.": "光是这种行为就足以令人震惊。然而，在恶魔女王的影响下，菌类和其他真菌在穿过地下城的隧道时释放出孢子云。陌生的香水和气味充斥着空气。行进中的菌类在穿过暗黑世界时播下了混乱的种子，在黑暗之湖周围穿行。其他有智慧的暗黑生物对这支队伍敬而远之。",
	"The fungi of the Underdark aren't the only ones on the move. Juiblex the Faceless Lord has caught wind of its rival Zuggtmoy's intentions and mobilized an army of oozes now making its way toward Araumycos. The demon lord wants to slow Zuggtmoy's progress toward her goal. More importantly, though, Juiblex seeks the opportunity to appear at the ceremony, either to thwart its rival's intentions, take advantage of Araumycos's vulnerability, or both. Though Araumycos represents the perfect mate to Zuggtmoy, Juiblex sees it only as a living feast of tremendous proportions.": "黑暗世界的真菌并不是唯一在行动的。无面者领主Juiblex听到了它的对手Zuggtmoy的意图，并动员了一支由渗虫组成的军队，现在正向Araumycos进发。恶魔领主想要延缓Zuggtmoy实现其目标的进程。但更重要的是，Juiblex希望有机会出现在仪式上，要么挫败其对手的意图，要么利用Araumycos的弱点，或者两者兼而有之。虽然Araumycos是Zuggtmoy的完美伴侣，但Juiblex只把它看作是一场巨大的生活盛宴。",
	"With both forces on the move, outbreaks of violence between oozes and fungi become more common, although the followers of Zuggtmoy outnumber the Faceless Lord's creatures.": "随着两股势力的移动，渗出物和真菌之间爆发的暴力事件变得更加普遍，尽管祖格莫伊的追随者人数超过了无面者之王的生物。",

Stepping off the litter as her followers set it down, the Demon Queen of Fungi rises to tower above all the creatures around her. \"My betrothed,\" she intones, the meaning of her words clear within the vision. \"I am here at last.\"": "Zuggtmoy身披模具和结实的蘑菇编织成的怪异长袍，披着面纱。隐约可见的类人形象上镶嵌着一簇簇发光的地衣和膨胀的真菌，像伴娘一样跟着她，带着面纱和花边菌丝的裙裾。当她的追随者把轿子放下时，真菌妖后走下轿子，站在她周围所有生物的上方。\"我的未婚妻，\"她说，她的话的含义在视野中很清楚。\"我终于来了。\"",
	"Navigating on the Astral Plane is largely a matter of thought and perception. The characters feel a psychic \"pull\" in the right direction as they seek out the consciousness of Araumycos with their own minds. A creature flies through the Astral Plane at a speed in feet equal to 3 × its Intelligence score, but a feeling of timelessness on the plane makes it difficult to judge the length of the journey.": "在星界的导航主要是一个思想和感知的问题。当人物用自己的思想去寻找Araumycos的意识时，他们会感觉到一种精神上的 \"牵引\"，使他们朝着正确的方向前进。一个生物在星界中飞行的速度，以英尺为单位，等于3×其智力分值，但在星界中的一种永恒的感觉使其难以判断旅程的长度。",
	"The characters' thoughts draw them toward a distant, floating object. It appears to be a hemisphere, until its slow rotation reveals its true form: a giant skull missing its jawbone, formed out of some kind of pale rock. As the characters draw closer, the skull reveals itself to be the size of a small mountain. Its surface is covered in lichens and broad patches of mold, the colors resembling those of Araumycos on the Material Plane.": "人物的思想把他们引向一个遥远的、漂浮的物体。它似乎是一个半球体，直到它缓慢的旋转显示出它的真实形态：一个缺少下颚骨的巨大头骨，由某种苍白的岩石形成。随着人物的走近，头骨显示出它有一座小山那么大。它的表面覆盖着地衣和大片的霉菌，颜色类似于物质界的Araumycos。",
	"Through the empty eye sockets of the skull, the adventurers can see that its interior is hollow and filled with a bewildering variety of giant fungi. Tendrils and growths extend outward, twining together to form a mass suspended in the middle of the open space—a brain-shaped fungus the size of a castle.": "透过头骨空洞的眼窝，冒险家们可以看到它的内部是空心的，充满了各种令人困惑的巨大真菌。卷须和生长物向外延伸，缠绕在一起，形成一个悬浮在开放空间中间的团块--一个有城堡大小的脑形真菌。",
	"The closer the characters come to the floating skull, the more strongly they feel a presence—the mind of Araumycos, to which they are linked. That consciousness is largely unaware of them, lulled by the insidious influence of Zuggtmoy's spores and unable to resist the demon queen's presence.": "人物越接近漂浮的头骨，他们就越强烈地感受到一种存在--Araumycos的思想，他们与之相连。这个意识在很大程度上没有意识到他们，他们被Zuggtmoy的孢子的阴险影响所迷惑，无法抵御恶魔女王的存在。",
	"When any character enters the skull or touches its surface, the mind of Araumycos stirs—and the Demon Queen of Fungi senses it. Read the following to the players as Zuggtmoy uses the connection of the rapport spores to push into Araumycos's mind.": "当任何角色进入头骨或接触其表面时，阿劳米科斯的思想就会骚动起来--而且真菌的恶魔女王也会感觉到它。当扎格莫伊利用和睦孢子的联系推入阿劳米科斯的头脑时，向玩家宣读以下内容。",
	"\"Who dares?\" a voice shouts in your mind. \"Who dares disturb my intended nuptials?\" Spores and tendrils erupt from the surface of the skull, coalescing before your eyes into the image of the Demon Queen of Fungi, her dead eyes glaring with inhuman fury.": "\"谁敢？\"一个声音在你心中喊道。\"谁敢打扰我的婚礼？\" 孢子和卷须从头骨表面喷发出来，在你眼前凝聚成真菌妖后的形象，她那双死寂的眼睛闪烁着非人的怒火。",
	"Zuggtmoy projects her psychic presence to confront the characters, while at the same time maintaining limited control over her material form. She intends to complete the ritual necessary to grant her full power over Araumycos, needing only to delay or destroy the intruders in order to succeed. The split in the Demon Queen's attention works in their favor, as Zuggtmoy's demonic rival Juiblex chooses that moment to launch its attack and claim Araumycos for its own.": "Zuggtmoy投射出她的精神存在来对抗这些人物，同时对她的物质形态保持有限的控制。她打算完成必要的仪式，赋予她对Araumycos的全部权力，只需要拖延或摧毁入侵者就能成功。恶魔女王注意力的分散对他们有利，因为Zuggtmoy的恶魔对手Juiblex选择在这个时候发动攻击，将Araumycos据为己有。",
	"Before Zuggtmoy acts against the adventurers, the demon queen is distracted, turning away to glance at something they can't see. She hisses the name \"Juiblex\" like a curse, then recoils as if struck. Her image then vanishes.": "在Zuggtmoy对冒险者采取行动之前，恶魔女王分心了，她转过身去，看了一眼他们看不到的东西。她像诅咒一样嘶吼着 \"Juiblex \"这个名字，然后像被击中了一样退缩了。她的形象随后消失了。",
	"As the psychic din awakens Araumycos from its trance, the shimmering colors piercing the silver of the Astral Plane flare even brighter. The following round, Araumycos enters into full rapport with the characters and their myconid allies. The entity reveals that Zuggtmoy has already infected its mind with her demonic influence, which Araumycos can feel growing in strength. It's only a matter of time before it falls to the demon queen's will. Focused but fearful, the entity asks the adventurers to cut out and destroy the diseased part of its mind before it's too late.": "当精神上的喧嚣将Araumycos从恍惚中唤醒时，刺穿星界银色的闪亮色彩变得更加耀眼。在接下来的回合中，阿劳米科斯与角色和他们的菌类盟友进入了完全默契的状态。这个实体显示，祖格莫伊已经用她的恶魔影响感染了它的思想，阿劳米科斯可以感觉到它的力量在不断增强。它落入恶魔女王的意志中只是时间问题。实体专注而恐惧，要求冒险家们在为时已晚之前切出并摧毁它头脑中的病变部分。",
	"When the infected area first takes damage, Zuggtmoy senses it and turns her attention away from Juiblex in an attempt to stop the characters. As she exerts her will over Araumycos, a burst of spores spreads out in a cloud from the infected area. Any creature within 20 feet of the infected area must make a successful DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take {@dice 3d6} poison damage and become {@condition poisoned}. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, the creature takes {@dice 3d6} poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A {@condition poisoned} creature can repeat the saving throw on each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.": "当感染区第一次受到伤害时，祖格莫伊感觉到了，并将她的注意力从朱布勒克斯身上移开，试图阻止这些人物。当她对Araumycos施展她的意志时，一阵阵的孢子从感染区以云的形式扩散开来。任何在感染区20英尺范围内的生物都必须成功地进行DC19宪法救赎，否则就会受到{@dice 3d6}的毒药伤害并变成{@condition poisoned}。当{@condition poisoned}以这种方式存在时，该生物在其每个回合开始时都会受到{@dice 3d6}的毒药伤害。一个{@condition poisoned}的生物可以在它的每个回合中重复这个蓄力动作，如果成功则结束对它的影响。",
	"As the characters destroy more of the infected area, the view beyond the bounds of the skull chamber begins to darken. When the area reaches 0 hit points, a powerful psychic wind howls through the area. Each character must make a successful DC 15 Intelligence saving throw to avoid the mental effect of a psychic wind (see \"{@book The Astral Plane|DMG|2|Astral Plane}\" in chapter 2 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}). This psychic wind has no location effect, as the rapport ends thereafter and the characters awaken back in their physical bodies. Physical damage and ongoing effects suffered by their astral forms aren't carried over to the characters' physical bodies.": "随着角色们摧毁更多被感染的区域，骷髅室边界以外的视野开始变暗。当该区域的命中率达到0时，一股强大的精神之风在该区域呼啸。每个角色必须成功地进行DC15智力救赎，以避免精神风的精神影响（见《{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}》第二章的\"{@book The Astral Plane|DMG|2|Astral Plane}\"）。这种精神之风没有位置效应，因为此后默契就会结束，人物会在他们的肉体中醒来。他们的星体所遭受的物理伤害和持续影响不会被带到人物的肉体上。",
	"If the characters free Araumycos from Zuggtmoy's influence, they weaken the power of the Demon Queen of Fungi, fatally distracting her. With the loss of many of her fungal minions and the amount of power she has expended to perform her ritual, Zuggtmoy is weakened to the point that Juiblex overwhelms her, destroying and consuming her material form and casting her essence back into the Abyss.": "如果人物将阿劳米科斯从祖格莫伊的影响中解救出来，他们就会削弱真菌魔后的力量，使她致命地分心。随着她的许多真菌爪牙的损失和她为举行仪式所消耗的力量，祖格莫伊被削弱到了一个地步，尤布勒克斯压倒了她，摧毁并吞噬了她的物质形态，并将她的精华投回了深渊。",
	"Characters reduced to 0 hit points in the battle on the Astral Plane are catapulted back to their bodies on the Material Plane. Their rapport with Araumycos is broken, and they are helpless to intervene further in the conflict going on within the entity's mind. You can have a group of oozes or spore servants from the Araumycos Encounters table appear in the cavern where the adventurers entered into rapport with Araumycos, so that characters shunted out of that rapport can defend their compatriots' helpless bodies while the fight continues.": "在星界的战斗中被降低到0点的角色会被弹回他们在物质界的身体。他们与Araumycos的关系被打破了，他们无力进一步干预在实体头脑中发生的冲突。你可以让Araumycos邂逅表中的一群Oozes或孢子仆从出现在冒险者与Araumycos建立默契的洞穴中，这样被分流出默契的角色就可以在战斗继续时保护他们的同胞无助的身体。",
	"If all the characters are defeated on the Astral Plane, the awakened Araumycos remains conscious enough to resist Zuggtmoy with a final effort, sufficient to distract the Demon Queen of Fungi and thereby allowing Juiblex to overwhelm her. In any event, the characters can hear the battle between Juiblex and Zuggtmoy unfolding in the ritual cavern just a few minutes ahead of them.": "如果所有的角色都在星界被击败，被唤醒的阿劳米科斯仍然有足够的意识，可以用最后的努力来抵抗祖格莫伊，足以分散真菌女王的注意力，从而让朱布勒克斯压倒她。在任何情况下，角色们都能听到在他们前面几分钟的仪式洞穴中，朱布利克斯和扎格莫伊之间的战斗正在展开。",
	"If the adventurers retreat from the sounds of battle, they barely escape from a partial collapse of their local section of Araumycos's cavern complex. They race ahead of a small horde of Zuggtmoy's minions, which are crushed by falling rock that also seals off the characters' escape route. Basidia and some of the myconid rebels survive, and will accompany the adventurers out of Araumycos's caverns before returning to Neverlight Grove to root out any remainder of the demon queen's infestation.": "如果冒险家们从战斗的声音中撤退，他们就会从Araumycos的洞穴群的局部坍塌中勉强逃脱。他们赶在一小群祖格特莫伊的爪牙之前，这些爪牙被落下的岩石压碎，也封住了人物的逃跑路线。巴斯蒂亚和一些菌类反叛者幸存下来，并将陪同冒险者离开阿劳米科斯的洞穴，然后返回永光丛林，铲除恶魔女王的残余侵扰。",
	"If the adventurers head toward the battle between the two demon lords after awakening from their rapport, they arrive just in time to see the grotesque display of the Faceless Lord slurping up the defeated Zuggtmoy into the mass of its body, enveloping and dissolving her before turning its attention toward the newcomers.": "如果冒险者在从默契中醒来后走向两个恶魔领主之间的战斗，他们到达时正好看到无面者领主将被打败的扎格莫伊吸进它的身体里，将她包裹并溶解，然后将注意力转向新人的怪异表现。",
	"Under normal circumstances, {@creature Juiblex|MTF} (see {@adventure appendix D|OotA|20}) would be an overwhelming foe. Fortunately for the adventurers, the Faceless Lord's battle with Zuggtmoy has weakened it. The characters might also have aid from allies, the newly freed myconids, and Araumycos in overcoming the demon lord.": "在正常情况下，{@creature Juiblex|MTF}（见{@adventure appendix D|OotA|20}）会是一个压倒性的敌人。对冒险者来说，幸运的是，无面者领主与Zuggtmoy的战斗已经削弱了它。在战胜恶魔领主的过程中，人物可能还会得到盟友、新释放的菌类和Araumycos的帮助。",
	"Apply the following penalties to Juiblex:": "对Juiblex适用以下处罚。",
	"Its current hit points are 200.": "它目前的命中率是200。",
	"It has no more uses of Legendary Resistance for the day.": "它在这一天没有再使用传奇抵抗。",
	"Its Eject Slime action has been used and must recharge.": "它的弹出粘液动作已被使用，必须重新充电。",
	"It has no lair actions or regional effects.": "它没有巢穴行动或区域效应。",
	"Basidia rallies thirty {@creature Myconid Adult||myconid adults} and thirty-two {@creature Drow Spore Servant|OotA|drow spore servants} (see {@adventure appendix C|OotA|19}) to fight alongside the characters. Their attacks are incapable of harming Juiblex. However, as they swarm around the demon lord, one time per round (as agreed upon by the players), a character who would be hit by an attack can have a myconid or a spore servant hit by the attack instead. The myconids can also fight off oozes, allowing the adventurers to focus their attention on the demon lord.": "Basidia召集了三十个{@creature Myconid Adult||myconid adults}和三十二个{@creature Drow Spore Servant|OotA|drow spore servants}(见{@adventure appendix C|OotA|19})与这些人物并肩作战。他们的攻击不可能伤害到朱布利克斯。然而，当它们围绕着恶魔领主成群结队时，每回合有一次（由玩家商定），一个会被攻击击中的角色可以让霉菌或孢子仆人代替它被攻击。霉菌也可以击退渗出物，让冒险者们把注意力集中到恶魔领主身上。",
	"If the adventurers freed it from Zuggtmoy's influence, Araumycos aids them by releasing spores into the cavern, granting all living creatures in the area immunity to poison damage and the {@condition poisoned} condition.": "如果冒险者把它从祖格莫伊的影响中解救出来，阿劳米科斯会帮助他们向洞穴释放孢子，赋予该地区所有生物对毒物伤害和{@condition poisoned}状况的免疫能力。",
	"The characters might overcome two demon lords if they are successful in this chapter. If they fail, terrible consequences unfold for the myconids and other creatures of the Underdark, though the adventurers will get another chance to take the fight to Zuggtmoy, Juiblex, and all the other demon lords in {@adventure chapter 17|OotA|16}.": "如果在这一章中获得成功，角色们可能会战胜两个恶魔领主。如果他们失败了，可怕的后果就会在暗黑世界的菌类和其他生物身上展开，不过冒险者们会有另一次机会，在{@adventure chapter 17|OotA|16}中向Zuggtmoy、Juiblex和其他所有恶魔领主发起战斗。",
	"If the characters lose their battle against Juiblex, their best hope lies in {@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA}'s ritual. In the worst-case scenario where one or more heroes fall in the fight against the Faceless Lord, their allies might be able to carry them to safety so that they can be healed or restored to life.": "如果人物在与朱布莱克斯的战斗中失败了，他们最好的希望在于{@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA}的祭祀。在最坏的情况下，一个或多个英雄在与无面者之王的战斗中倒下了，他们的盟友也许能把他们抬到安全的地方，这样他们就能得到治疗或恢复生命。",
	"If the adventurers succeed, they achieve a great victory with two demon lords banished back to the Abyss. The creatures under the demon lords' influence eventually return to normal. Neither Zuggtmoy nor Juiblex is truly destroyed, however. Each demon lord reforms on its layer of the Abyss, never forgetting those responsible for its defeat.": "如果冒险家们成功了，他们取得了巨大的胜利，两个恶魔领主被驱逐回深渊。受恶魔领主影响的生物最终恢复了正常。然而，Zuggtmoy和Juiblex都没有被真正摧毁。每个恶魔领主都在其所在的深渊层进行改革，永远不会忘记那些对其失败负有责任的人。",
	"The elimination of the Demon Queen of Fungi wins the adventurers the eternal gratitude of the surviving myconids of Neverlight Grove. Basidia quickly assumes leadership of the grove, taking steps to heal the minds of those myconids afflicted by demonic corruption. The myconids also declare their intention to cleanse their home of Zuggtmoy's lingering influence.": "消灭了真菌魔后，冒险者们赢得了永光丛林中幸存的霉菌们的永远感激。巴斯蒂亚很快就担任了小树林的领导，采取措施来治愈那些被恶魔腐蚀折磨的菌类的心灵。霉菌们还宣布他们打算清除他们的家园，消除祖格莫伊挥之不去的影响。",
	"The removal of Juiblex from the Underdark causes most oozes and related creatures to revert to their normal state. If {@creature the Pudding King|OotA} survived this long, he retreats to Blingdenstone, but it's a far easier matter for the deep gnomes to deal with him and his oozing minions without Juiblex around.": "从暗黑世界中移除Juiblex会导致大多数的渗水者和相关生物恢复到正常状态。如果{@creature the Pudding King|OotA}活了这么久，他就会撤退到布林登石，但如果没有朱布莱克斯在身边，深渊地精对付他和他的渗水小弟就会容易得多。",
	"Even if Araumycos survives, its fate is unclear. The entity's mind has clearly been damaged by both the necessity of cutting away its corruption and the buffeting force of the psychic wind that followed. Basidia and the myconids offer to meld with Araumycos to try to heal it and guide it back to wholeness. Though not as serious as death, the trauma still causes a significant amount of fungal die-off in areas of the creature's domain, potentially uncovering lost ruins or other hidden sites.": "即使Araumycos活了下来，它的命运也不清楚。这个实体的头脑显然已经被切断其腐败的必要性和随后的精神之风的冲击力所破坏。巴斯蒂亚和菌类提出与阿劳米科斯融合，试图治愈它并引导它回到完整的状态。虽然没有死亡那么严重，但这一创伤仍然导致该生物领域的大量真菌死亡，可能会发现失落的遗迹或其他隐藏的地点。",
	"In addition to possible victory over one or two demon lords, the adventurers receive one last bequest from the mind of Araumycos. A puff of rapport spores or a lingering psychic connection informs them of one or more of the secrets of the Underdark gathered during the entity's vast existence. If you want to provide the players with any remaining information about virtually anything in the adventure, this is an excellent opportunity to do so.": "除了可能战胜一两个恶魔领主之外，冒险者们还能从阿劳米科斯的脑海中得到最后一个遗愿。一股和睦相处的孢子或一种挥之不去的精神联系会告诉他们在这个实体庞大的存在期间收集到的一个或多个地下城的秘密。如果你想为玩家提供关于冒险中几乎任何东西的剩余信息，这是一个很好的机会。",
	"If the characters didn't collect traces of Yeenoghu's blood from the fallen goristro in {@area chapter 14|4b8|x}, any successful weapon attack against Juiblex in this chapter leaves traces of the Faceless Lord's blood on a character's weapon. Collecting this blood for {@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA} provides another component he needs to craft his {@i dark heart} talisman.": "如果角色没有在{@area chapter 14|4b8|x}中从倒下的小人身上收集Yeenoghu的血迹，那么在本章中对Juiblex的任何成功的武器攻击都会在角色的武器上留下无面领主的血迹。为{@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA}收集这些血液可以提供他制作{@i dark heart}护身符所需的另一种成分。",
	"If the characters rid Araumycos's mind of its demonic infection, award each of them 2,000 XP.

	"In the culmination of {@i Out of the Abyss}, the heroes implement {@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA}'s scheme to take on the demon lords. The archmage's ritual draws the demon lords together to fight to the death, leaving Demogorgon victorious but weakened as the adventurers face off against the Prince of Demons. Even wounded and weakened, though, Demogorgon is a legendary foe, and the fate of the Underdark and all Faerûn rests on the adventurers' final battle.": "在{@i Out of the Abyss}的高潮中，英雄们实施{@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA}的计划来对付恶魔领主。大法师的仪式将恶魔领主们吸引到一起，进行殊死搏斗，在冒险者们与恶魔王子的对决中，德摩根取得了胜利，但却被削弱了。即使受伤和虚弱，德摩根也是一个传奇性的敌人，暗黑世界和整个法鲁恩的命运都取决于冒险者们的最后一战。",

When the ritual reaches its conclusion at the end of nine hours, portals of {@i faerzress} form. All the demons and demon lords in the Underdark are drawn through those portals, appearing together in the area around the {@i dark heart} talisman.": "维泽兰（如果学徒可以的话，由格林协助），在他的塔楼的圣殿中进行复杂的仪式。仪式使{@i dark heart}用{@i faerzress}向整个暗黑世界发出召唤--一种不可抗拒的召唤，将恶魔吸引到它身边。当仪式在九小时后结束时，{@i faerzress}的门户形成。幽暗世界中所有的恶魔和恶魔领主都被吸引到这些门户中，一起出现在{@i dark heart}神器周围的区域。",
	"Enraged by being forcibly summoned yet again by a ritual, the demons fly into a frenzy once they see each other, beginning a battle to the death. As each demon's material form is destroyed, its essence is banished back into the Abyss. The task of the adventurers is to be close at hand but not get caught up in the battle until one demon lord is left standing, weakened and spent from the conflict. That becomes the adventurers' cue to attack and destroy the last demon lord, banishing it to the Abyss if they succeed.": "由于再次被仪式强行召唤，恶魔们被激怒了，一见到对方就陷入狂热，开始了一场生死大战。当每个恶魔的物质形态被摧毁时，它的本质被放逐回深渊。冒险家们的任务是近在咫尺，但不要被卷入战斗，直到留下一个恶魔领主，在冲突中被削弱和消耗。这就成了冒险者攻击并摧毁最后一个恶魔领主的提示，如果他们成功了，就把它放逐到深渊。",
	"If you want to pose a moral dilemma for the characters, have Vizeran tell them that the ritual needs a final component, to be delivered while it is performed: the sacrifice of an innocent sentient being, whose blood will fuel and activate the ritual's fiendish magic. Will the adventurers willingly sacrifice one life to stop the demon lords from threatening the Underdark and the whole of Faerûn?": "如果你想给角色们提出一个道德难题，可以让维泽兰告诉他们，仪式需要一个最后的组成部分，在进行的时候要交付：牺牲一个无辜的有生命的人，他的血会助长和激活仪式的邪恶魔法。冒险家们是否愿意牺牲一个人的生命来阻止恶魔领主对地下世界和整个法鲁恩的威胁？",
	"This kind of moral dilemma can add significant drama to the story. However, it can also be played out as a red herring—by having it be something Vizeran asks for even though it's not necessary. The drow archmage might be testing the characters to see how far they'll go, or he could be afflicted with madness that makes him believe such a sacrifice is necessary even though it isn't.": "这种道德困境可以为故事增加重要的戏剧性。然而，它也可以作为一个红色的诱饵--让它成为维泽兰要求的东西，尽管它并不是必须的。鸦人大法师可能是在试探人物，看他们会走多远，或者他可能被疯狂所困扰，使他相信这样的牺牲是必要的，尽管它不是。",
	"A character can figure out the truth with a DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check, or by consulting Gromph Baenre's grimoire (see {@area chapter 15|570|x}).

	"One or more of the characters might choose to stay with Vizeran during the nine-hour performance of the ritual, whether to guard against treachery or to reclaim Gromph's grimoire once the ritual is done. If this is the case, you can add some action for those who remain behind by having a small number of the demons summoned by the ritual attracted to the site of the ritual rather than the location of the {@i dark heart} talisman. Alternatively, agents of {@creature Quenthel Baenre|OotA} or Jarlaxle can attack Araj when the ritual is complete, wanting to silence Vizeran before he can reveal what he knows about Gromph Baenre (see {@area chapter 15|4d5|x}).": "在9个小时的仪式过程中，一个或多个角色可能会选择留在维泽兰身边，无论是为了防止背叛，还是为了在仪式结束后夺回格罗姆夫的魔法书。如果是这样的话，你可以为那些留下来的人增加一些行动，让仪式所召唤的少量恶魔被吸引到仪式现场而不是{@i dark heart}护身符的位置。另外，{@creature Quenthel Baenre|OotA}或Jarlaxle的代理人可以在仪式完成后攻击Araj，想在维泽兰说出他所知道的关于Gromph Baenre的事情之前让他闭嘴（见{@area chapter 15|4d5|x}）。",
	"Vizeran might also learn of Grin Ousstyl's betrayal of information to the adventurers, and choose to eliminate him immediately after he's served his purpose in assisting with the ritual.

	"If the characters inform the myconids of their need for a place to stage a daring last battle, {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA} or another myconid representative might offer Neverlight Grove. The ranks of the myconids have been decimated by Zuggtmoy's depredations and the fetid wedding, and many fear their beloved caverns are corrupted. They are willing to seek a new home (perhaps in the caverns of Araumycos) and grateful enough to the heroes that they will sacrifice their old home to help them.": "如果角色们告诉霉菌人他们需要一个地方来进行大胆的最后一战，{@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA}或其他霉菌人代表可能会提供永光丛林。菌类的队伍已经被祖格莫伊的掠夺和腥臭的婚礼所摧毁，许多人担心他们心爱的洞穴被腐蚀。他们愿意寻找一个新的家园（也许是在阿劳米科斯的岩洞里），并对英雄们心存感激，愿意牺牲自己的老家来帮助他们。",
	"The ruins of the kuo-toa settlement (see {@area chapter 3|112|x}) could become the site of the final fight against the demon lords. {@creature Shuushar the Awakened|OotA} can be convinced to help evacuate the remaining inhabitants if asked. The nearby Darklake creates its own challenges, particularly given the presence of ixitxachitl loyal to Demogorgon.": "kuo-toa定居点的废墟（见{@area chapter 3|112|x}）可能成为与恶魔领主进行最后斗争的场所。如果被要求，可以说服{@creature Shuushar the Awakened|OotA}帮助疏散剩余的居民。附近的黑暗湖创造了自己的挑战，特别是考虑到忠于德摩根的ixitxachitl的存在。",
	"The demon lords are some of the most powerful foes a party of adventurers could face. Indeed, any one of them at full strength could wipe out a group of 15th-level characters with ease. Fortunately for the heroes, the goal of Vizeran's plan isn't to fight multiple demon lords, but to turn them against each other. With the right combination of preparation, timing, and execution, the characters set the trap that Vizeran springs with his ritual—and hope whichever demon lord survives is weakened enough for them to destroy it.": "恶魔领主是一队冒险者可能面对的最强大的敌人之一。事实上，他们中的任何一个人在全力以赴的情况下都可以轻松地消灭一群15级的角色。幸运的是，维泽兰计划的目标不是与多个恶魔领主作战，而是让他们彼此对立。有了正确的准备、时机和执行的组合，角色们设置了维泽兰用他的仪式弹出的陷阱--希望哪个恶魔领主幸存下来，就会被削弱到他们可以摧毁它。",
	"Most of the heroes' allies are of limited use against the demon lords—creatures immune to many forms of attack, including nonmagical weapons. Rather than dealing with the ineffectual attacks of allies or a dozen or more additional actions each round, give characters backed up by a group of allies the following benefits.": "大多数英雄的盟友在面对恶魔领主时作用有限--他们对许多形式的攻击都免疫，包括非魔法武器。与其应对盟友的无效攻击或每轮一打或更多的额外行动，不如给有一群盟友支持的角色以下列好处。",
	"A character regains {@dice 2d6} hit points at the end of each of his or her turns, provided the character has at least 1 hit point remaining.": "一个角色在他或她的每个回合结束时都会恢复{@dice 2d6}的命中率，只要该角色至少还有1个命中率。",
	"Once each round, when a player character would be hit by an attack, a supporting ally is hit by the attack instead. The adventurers can use this option ten times before their allies are too weakened or depleted to provide assistance.": "每回合一次，当玩家角色会被攻击击中时，一个支持他的盟友会被攻击击中。在他们的盟友被削弱或耗尽而无法提供帮助之前，冒险者可以使用这个选项十次。",
	"Players should never have to think about sacrificing their characters, but you should be prepared for the possibility of one or more of the heroes giving up their lives in order to defeat the evil that has arisen in the Underdark. It's up to you how to handle such a high-stakes event, but consider treating it as an extreme variation of \"{@book Success at a Cost|DMG|8|Resolution and Consequences}\" from chapter 8 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}. At the very least, a player deliberately sacrificing his or her character's life in a final, selfless heroic effort—the antithesis of the selfishness and evil of the Abyss—should grant all the character's allies inspiration. The sacrifice might not be enough to win the day on its own, but it can help turn the tide.": "玩家不应该考虑牺牲自己的角色，但你应该准备好一个或多个英雄为了打败地下城出现的邪恶而放弃自己的生命的可能性。如何处理这样一个高风险的事件取决于你，但可以考虑把它当作《{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}》第八章中\"{@book Success at a Cost|DMG|8|Resolution and Consequences} \"的极端变种。至少，一个玩家故意在最后无私的英雄主义努力中牺牲他或她的角色的生命--深渊的自私和邪恶的对立面--应该给予该角色的所有盟友以激励。牺牲本身可能不足以赢得胜利，但它可以帮助扭转局势。",
	"Once the {@i dark heart} talisman is placed and the characters signal Vizeran, there's no turning back.": "一旦放置了{@i dark heart}护身符，人物发出维泽兰的信号，就没有回头路了。",
	"The waiting is the hard part. Time seems to drag as you remain alert, weapons drawn, every nerve singing with the tension in the air all around you.": "等待是最困难的部分。当你保持警惕，拔出武器，每根神经都随着周围空气中的紧张气氛而歌唱时，时间似乎变得漫长。",
	"Finally, a swirling light begins to flare in the darkness. A barely audible humming shakes you to the core, rising and falling like a vast heartbeat in the depths. The glow of {@i faerzress} gathers and brightens, creating swirling pools like holes torn in the air. A roar sounds from far away as shadows move in the depths of those pools of light. The demons are coming.": "最后，黑暗中开始出现一道漩涡状的光。一阵几乎听不到的嗡嗡声让你心头一震，在深处像一个巨大的心跳一样起伏不定。％0％）的光芒聚集并变亮，形成漩涡状的水池，就像在空气中撕裂的洞。当影子在这些光池的深处移动时，一声怒吼从远处传来。恶魔们来了。",

	"If Fraz-Urb'luu was not sent back to the Abyss in {@area chapter 9|34f|x}, his gemstone is hurled into the fray by Vizeran's ritual.

	"If Juiblex and Zuggtmoy were sent back to the Abyss in earlier parts of the adventure, they are not present.": "如果Juiblex和Zuggtmoy在冒险的早期部分被送回深渊，他们就不会出现。",
	"Baphomet and Yeenoghu are absent if the characters activated the Maze Engine (see {@area chapter 14|4c8|x}) and the 81–100 result on the Maze Engine Effects table came up.": "如果角色启动了迷宫引擎（见{@area chapter 14|4c8|x}）并且迷宫引擎效果表上的81-100结果出现，那么巴弗灭和耶诺古就不存在。",
	"Numerous other demons also pour through the portals. For a brief moment, all of the demons and demon lords are disoriented as they attempt to get their bearings after being pulled across the Underdark. Then as their gazes fall upon each other, they roar, bellow, or shriek with a hatred too deep for mortals to truly comprehend, and the terrible battle begins.": "无数其他的恶魔也涌入了门户。在一个短暂的时刻，所有的恶魔和恶魔领主都迷失了方向，因为他们试图在被拉过暗黑世界后找到自己的方向。然后，当他们的目光落在对方身上时，他们咆哮、吼叫或尖叫，仇恨之深，凡人无法真正理解，可怕的战斗开始了。",
	"If the adventurers need some extra help in their epic final battle at the end of the campaign, consider the following option involving {@creature Jimjar|OotA}, the deep gnome gambler they met in the drow slave pen in {@area chapter 1|008|x} of the adventure.": "如果冒险者在战役结束时的史诗般的最后一战中需要一些额外的帮助，可以考虑以下方案，让他们在冒险的{@area chapter 1|008|x}中在鸦人的奴隶圈中遇到的深层地精赌徒{@creature Jimjar|OotA}参与进来。",
	"\"{@creature Jimjar|OotA}\" isn't at all who he appears. He is, in fact, a god or other great power in disguise—or the Chosen of such a power—and has been watching the heroes since their first encounter in Velkynvelve. His reasons for doing this are his own, but when push comes to shove, he can give the heroes some help in overcoming the demon lords.": "\"{@creature Jimjar|OotA} \"根本就不是他所出现的样子。事实上，他是一个神或其他伟大力量的伪装者--或者说是这种力量的选民--自从英雄们在Velkynvelve第一次相遇后就一直在监视他们。他这样做的原因是他自己的，但在迫不得已的情况下，他可以给英雄们一些帮助，帮助他们战胜恶魔领主。",
	"At an opportune moment, {@creature Jimjar|OotA} shows up (even returning from death if he appeared to perish earlier in the adventure) and gives the characters a vote of encouragement, telling them, \"I bet you can do this.\" Each character gains inspiration and a {@i blessing of wound closure} (see \"{@book Other Rewards|DMG|7|Other Rewards}\" in chapter 7 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}). {@creature Jimjar|OotA} disappears afterward, potentially putting in one last appearance at the end of the adventure to hint as to his true nature before vanishing into the Underdark.": "在一个合适的时刻，{@creature Jimjar|OotA}出现了（如果他在冒险的早些时候出现了灭亡，甚至可以死而复生），给角色们投下了鼓励的一票，告诉他们，\"我打赌你能做到\"。每个角色都会获得灵感和一个{@i blessing of wound closure}（见{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}第7章的\"{@book Other Rewards|DMG|7|Other Rewards}\"）。{@creature Jimjar|OotA}之后就消失了，可能会在冒险结束时最后一次出现，暗示他在消失在暗黑世界之前的真实本性。",
	"Ideally, the adventurers and their allies remain hidden from the battling demons, letting them fight it out among themselves. Still, there are challenges for the characters to overcome as they wait. Feel free to include as many of the following as you wish while narrating the struggle between the demon lords and their minions, keeping in mind that the characters will have no time for even a short rest before taking on the main challenge of this encounter—a fight with the sole remaining demon lord.": "理想的情况是，冒险者和他们的盟友在战斗的恶魔面前保持隐蔽，让他们在自己之间进行斗争。不过，在等待的过程中，还是有一些挑战需要人物去克服。在叙述恶魔领主和他们的爪牙之间的斗争时，你可以随意加入以下内容，但要记住，在接受这次遭遇战的主要挑战--与唯一剩下的恶魔领主的战斗--之前，角色们甚至没有时间进行短暂的休息。",

Brief tactical retreats are permissible, but Vizeran's ritual has filled the demon lords with the rage to do battle.": "玩家控制恶魔们进行生死之战，唯一的限制是他们不能退出战斗。短暂的战术撤退是允许的，但维泽兰的仪式让恶魔领主们充满了战斗的怒火。",

	"If the battle takes place in a populated area such as Menzoberranzan, the characters spot bystanders under attack by lesser demons that prefer to take on easy prey rather than fighting against their own kind. A dozen {@creature Dretch||dretches} or {@creature manes} (50 percent chance of either) attack, killing and consuming their mortal victims unless the adventurers intervene.": "如果战斗发生在人口稠密的地区，例如门索布兰山，角色们会发现旁观者受到较低级的恶魔的攻击，这些恶魔宁愿选择容易的猎物，也不愿与自己的同类战斗。一打{@creature Dretch||dretches}或{@creature manes}(50%的几率)的攻击，杀死并吞噬了他们的受害者，除非冒险者进行干预。",
	"After running any events you wish from \"The Battle,\" the struggle between the demon lords comes to an end as Demogorgon proves why he is known as the Prince of Demons.": "在运行 \"战斗 \"中的任何事件后，恶魔领主之间的斗争结束了，德摩根证明了他为什么被称为恶魔王子。",
	"The sounds of battle finally die away, the ground before you stained black and red with demonic blood and ichor. In the terrible grip of Demogorgon, even the mighty Orcus looks almost small. Tentacles hold the Demon Prince of Undeath in a crushing grip, slithering across the maggot-riddled flesh of the horned demon, as they tighten inexorably. A strangled gasp issues from the demon lord's throat as a horrific crunching sound echoes throughout the cavern and his skull-topped wand clatters onto the floor.": "战斗的声音终于消失了，你面前的地面被恶魔的血液和汁液染成黑色和红色。在德摩根的可怕控制下，即使是强大的奥库斯看起来也很渺小。触手将不死的恶魔王子紧紧抓住，在有角的恶魔满是蛆虫的肉体上滑行，它们不可阻挡地收紧。当可怕的嘎吱声在整个洞穴中回荡时，恶魔领主的喉咙里发出了一声窒息的喘息声，他的头骨顶上的魔杖哗啦啦地掉在地上。",
	"Demogorgon casts aside the limp form, which melts away as Orcus returns to the Abyss that spawned him. The Prince of Demons throws back his two heads and roars his triumph. As he does, his nearer head turns, burning eyes raking across the battlefield. Filled with bloodlust and battle rage, the demon lord searches for another target.": "德摩根将软弱的身躯扔到一边，当奥库斯回到孕育他的深渊时，它就融化了。恶魔王子甩开他的两个头，发出胜利的吼声。当他这样做时，他近在咫尺的头颅转过来，灼热的目光扫视着整个战场。充满了嗜血和战斗的愤怒，恶魔领主寻找着另一个目标。",
	"Determine the characters' starting positions based on their actions during the battle. Demogorgon should be at least 80 feet away from them initially, unless the players specifically stated they were remaining close to the demon lord.": "根据他们在战斗中的行动来确定人物的起始位置。除非玩家特别说明他们要继续靠近恶魔领主，否则德摩根最初应该离他们至少80英尺远。",
	"Demogorgon has been wounded during the fight, giving the characters an edge in the battle to come. Apply the following penalties to the {@creature Demogorgon|MTF} stat block in {@adventure appendix D|OotA|20}:": "德摩根在战斗中受了伤，使人物在接下来的战斗中获得了优势。对{@adventure appendix D|OotA|20}中的{@creature Demogorgon|MTF}状态块实施以下惩罚措施。",

	"With all the other demon lords banished back to the Abyss, Demogorgon becomes the focus of the disruptive power of Vizeran's ritual. This imposes a −5 penalty to his attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.": "随着所有其他恶魔领主被放逐回深渊，德摩根成为维泽兰仪式的破坏性力量的焦点。这对他的攻击卷轴、能力检查和蓄力投掷造成-5的惩罚。",
	"Even in his weakened state, the demon lord remains a terrifying opponent, attacking the adventurers in a howling fury as battle is joined.": "即使在虚弱的状态下，恶魔领主仍然是一个可怕的对手，在战斗加入的时候，他咆哮着攻击冒险者们。",
	"When Orcus is defeated, he drops the {@item Wand of Orcus} (see {@book chapter 7|DMG|-1} of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}), which falls to the ground. A party member can try to grab the wand before Demogorgon seizes it as a trophy, but any such theft draws the attention and ire of the Prince of Demons. Angry at its master's defeat, the {@item Wand of Orcus} tries to attune itself to the first willing creature other than Demogorgon that touches it. The attunement is instantaneous, allowing the wand's properties to be used during the battle.": "当奥库斯被打败时，他会掉下{@item Wand of Orcus}（见{@book chapter 7|DMG|-1}的{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}），掉在地上。党员可以在德摩根夺取魔杖作为战利品之前试图夺取它，但任何这样的偷窃行为都会引起恶魔王子的注意和愤怒。愤怒于它主人的失败，{@item Wand of Orcus}试图将自己与第一个愿意接触它的除德摩根之外的生物相融合。适应是瞬间的，允许魔杖的属性在战斗中使用。",
	"If the characters reduce the Prince of Demons to 0 hit points, they disrupt and destroy his material form. Shrieking and gibbering, the Prince of Demons disintegrates as his foul essence is cast back into the Abyss, ending the demonic threat to the Underdark.": "如果这些角色将恶魔王子的命中率降至0，他们就会破坏并摧毁他的物质形态。在尖叫和胡言乱语中，恶魔王子解体了，因为他的污秽精华被扔回了深渊，结束了恶魔对地下城的威胁。",
	"If the characters fail to destroy Demogorgon, see \"Demon Lords Triumphant.\"": "如果人物未能消灭德摩根，请参阅 \"恶魔领主的胜利\"。",
	"If you prefer, a demon lord other than Demogorgon could be the victor of the demonic showdown and the final foe of the campaign. This is particularly appropriate if the adventurers earned the ire of a specific demon lord during the adventure (including Juiblex or Yeenoghu). Alternatively, one or more of the characters' backgrounds might be tied to a particular demon lord.": "如果你愿意的话，除德摩根外的其他恶魔领主可以成为恶魔对决的胜利者和活动的最终敌人。如果冒险者在冒险过程中赢得了某个特定恶魔领主的愤怒（包括Juiblex或Yeenoghu），这就特别合适。另外，一个或多个角色的背景可能与某个特定的恶魔领主有关系。",
	"The conclusion of {@i Out of the Abyss} can be relatively quick and straightforward if Vizeran's scheme is successful and the heroes are victorious. The survivors of the battle against the demon lords can make their way out of the Underdark to report to a grateful alliance of surface-world factions that the threat is ended.": "如果维泽兰的计划成功，英雄们取得了胜利，那么{@i Out of the Abyss}的结论就会相对迅速而直接。对抗恶魔领主的战斗的幸存者可以离开暗黑世界，向表面世界各派别的感恩联盟报告，威胁已经结束。",
	"Major loose threads left hanging at the end of the final battle include the following.": "最后一战结束时留下的主要松散线索包括以下内容。",
	"After recovering Gromph Baenre's grimoire from Sorcere in {@area chapter 15|55e|x}, the characters might think about what to do with the dark tome once the threat of the demon lords is ended. The knowledge and power the book represents are dangerous in anyone's hands—especially {@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA}'s, given what the characters know of him. However, the drow archmage doesn't give up the grimoire willingly.": "在从{@area chapter 15|55e|x}的巫师那里拿回格罗姆夫-巴恩雷的魔法书后，人物可能会考虑一旦恶魔领主的威胁结束，该如何处理这本黑暗巨著。这本书所代表的知识和力量在任何人手中都是危险的--尤其是{@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA}的，鉴于角色们对他的了解。然而，鸦人大法师并不甘心放弃这本魔法书。",
	"Finding a means to get rid of Gromph's grimoire once and for all could be the basis for continued adventures, perhaps even leading characters into the Abyss (see \"Into the Demonweb Pits\"). Alternatively, if you arrange for the book to be stolen from Vizeran before the characters can deal with it, they might need to recover it to ensure its powers are never misused again.": "找到彻底摆脱格罗姆夫的魔法书的方法可以成为继续冒险的基础，也许甚至可以将角色带入深渊（见 \"进入魔网之坑\"）。另外，如果你在人物处理这本书之前安排这本书从维泽兰被盗，他们可能需要找回它，以确保它的力量不再被滥用。",
	"If you prefer to tie up loose ends concerning the grimoire, you can have it banished into the Abyss along with the demon lords. It might be reclaimed by Lolth or lost somewhere within the infinite depths of that plane, at least until it resurfaces again.": "如果你想了结关于魔法书的未了之事，你可以让它和恶魔领主一起被放逐到深渊。它可能会被洛尔思领回，或者遗失在那个平面的无限深处的某个地方，至少在它再次出现之前。",
	"One or more of the demon lords might remain in the Underdark or on the Material Plane by the end of the campaign, having managed to avoid being drawn into Vizeran's trap. Graz'zt is a good possibility. In this case, a continuing campaign might be necessary for the high-level heroes to acquire the resources they need to take on any remaining demon lords, since the trick with the {@i dark heart} isn't going to work a second time.": "在战役结束时，一个或多个恶魔领主可能会留在暗黑世界或物质界，因为他们设法避免被卷入维泽兰的陷阱。格拉兹兹特（Graz'zt）是一个不错的可能性。在这种情况下，为了让高级英雄们获得对付任何剩余恶魔领主所需的资源，持续的战役可能是必要的，因为{@i dark heart}的把戏不会再有第二次。",
	"Ambitious adventurers might decide to take the fight to Lolth, seeking to punish her for what she unleashed on the Material Plane and to undo whatever her scheme might have gained her. Vizeran will be inclined to help them find a way to reach the Demonweb (Lolth's layer of the Abyss), since the drow archmage hates the Demon Queen of Spiders and her subjugation of his race.": "雄心勃勃的冒险者可能会决定向洛尔思发起战斗，寻求惩罚她在物质世界释放的东西，并消除她的计划可能为她带来的一切。维泽兰会倾向于帮助他们找到到达恶魔网（洛尔思的深渊层）的方法，因为这位乌鸦大法师憎恨蜘蛛的恶魔女王和她对他的种族的征服。",
	"As they travel through the Abyss, the characters might discover that the demon lords they defeated in the Underdark are potential allies in this new quest. Those demon lords want their own revenge upon Lolth for her scheme, and it might suit their mad whims to use the adventurers as their agents to achieve it.": "当他们在深渊中旅行时，人物可能会发现他们在暗黑世界打败的恶魔领主是这个新任务的潜在盟友。那些恶魔领主想为洛尔思的计划而对她进行报复，而利用冒险者作为他们的代理人来实现这一目的可能会符合他们疯狂的想法。",
	"If and when the characters confront Lolth, they find her pregnant and surrounded by thousands of eggs—her unborn young. When the eggs hatch, the Demon Queen of Spiders plans to send her offspring throughout the Abyss, creating a new generation of demon lords under her sway. How the heroes thwart Lolth's mad scheme remains to be seen!": "如果当人物与洛尔思对峙时，他们会发现她怀孕了，并且被成千上万的蛋--她未出生的孩子所包围。当这些蛋孵化后，蜘蛛妖后计划将她的后代送到整个深渊，在她的控制下创造出新一代的恶魔领主。英雄们如何挫败洛尔思的疯狂计划，还有待观察!",
	"In the event the heroes were not successful, a potential new campaign could take place in a Faerûn threatened—or even ruled—by demon lords with access to the surface world. In addition to their summoned armies of demons and fiendish creatures, they gather worldly forces of chaos and evil to their banners to launch a war against all civilized lands. A world under the assault or rule of the demon lords is a world in need of heroes.": "如果英雄们没有成功，一个潜在的新战役可能会发生在一个受到威胁的法鲁恩，或者甚至被能够进入地表世界的恶魔领主统治。除了他们召唤的恶魔和邪恶生物的军队外，他们还将世界上的混乱和邪恶力量聚集到他们的旗帜下，对所有文明的土地发动战争。一个被恶魔领主攻击或统治的世界是一个需要英雄的世界。",
	"If the City of Spiders is the site of the demon lords' battle, it is damaged even more than it was by Demogorgon's arrival. Word of the city's misfortune spreads throughout the Underdark, with other races and factions trying to claim some of the power long held by the drow.": "如果蜘蛛之城是恶魔领主的战斗地点，那么它受到的损害甚至比德摩根的到来还要大。城市不幸的消息传遍了整个暗黑世界，其他种族和派别都试图要求获得一些长期由鸦人掌握的权力。",
	"Despite Vizeran's best efforts, not all drow believe that Lolth is responsible for the disaster, instead blaming a lack of faith in the Demon Queen of Spiders, as well as the power of the wizards. Chaos and agitation for change embroil the city, forcing the already weakened ruling houses to put down challenges to their power even as they make concessions to their rivals.": "尽管维泽兰做出了最大的努力，但并不是所有的鸦人都相信洛尔思要对这场灾难负责，而是指责对蜘蛛魔后缺乏信心，以及巫师的力量。混乱和对变革的鼓动使这个城市陷入了困境，迫使已经被削弱的统治家族压制对其权力的挑战，甚至向他们的对手做出让步。",
	"A civil war between the drow isn't likely to remain contained within Menzoberranzan—or even the Underdark—as different sides look for resources and advantages. The adventurers could get involved on either side of the conflict, or might aid surface-world factions intent on containing the war in the Underdark until it eventually winds down.": "鸦人之间的内战不可能一直控制在门索布兰赞--甚至是暗黑世界--因为双方都在寻找资源和优势。冒险家们可能会参与到冲突的任何一方，也可能会帮助地面世界的派别将战争控制在暗黑世界，直到它最终结束。",
	"Even if the heroes eliminate the threat the demon lords represent to Gauntlgrym, the Underdark remains in a state of chaos. The defenders of Gauntlgrym need aid to rebuild and strengthen the city's defenses, and to remain vigilant for new threats gathering in the dark depths of the world. King Bruenor might offer the triumphant heroes noble titles and positions of power in his kingdom in the hope of enlisting their aid against the troubles to come. The adventurers might get the opportunity to earn those titles all over again when an Underdark army marches on the dwarf kingdom, determined to claim Gauntlgrym and the power of the primordial bound within its Great Forge.": "即使英雄们消除了恶魔领主对Gauntlgrym的威胁，地下世界仍然处于混乱状态。Gauntlgrym的守卫者需要援助来重建和加强城市的防御，并对聚集在世界黑暗深处的新威胁保持警惕。布鲁诺国王可能会给胜利的英雄们提供高贵的头衔和在他的王国中的权力地位，希望能得到他们的帮助来对抗即将到来的麻烦。当一支暗黑大军向矮人王国进发，决心夺取冈特格雷姆和大锻造场中原始束缚的力量时，冒险者们可能会有机会重新赢得这些头衔。",
	"Although Vizeran won't immediately turn against his former allies, the adventurers would be fools to trust him. He seizes any opportunity to increase his own power and prestige, including holding on to Gromph's grimoire and any ritual components or trinkets the adventurers might have acquired for him.": "虽然维泽兰不会立即与他以前的盟友反目成仇，但冒险者们要相信他就太傻了。他抓住任何机会来提高自己的权力和威望，包括抓着格罗夫的魔法书和冒险者可能为他获得的任何仪式组件或饰品。",
	"If the adventurers thwarted Vizeran's revenge scheme by placing the {@i dark heart} talisman somewhere other than Menzoberranzan, they earn the drow archmage's enmity. Vizeran's plots expand to include the adventurers as well as his own people, and the next great challenge the heroes face might come from the archmage as he plans his revenge.": "如果冒险者将{@i dark heart}护身符放在门索布兰赞以外的地方，从而挫败了维泽兰的复仇计划，他们就会赢得鸦人大法师的敌意。维泽兰的阴谋扩大到包括冒险者以及他自己的人民，而英雄们面临的下一个巨大挑战可能来自大法师的复仇计划。",
