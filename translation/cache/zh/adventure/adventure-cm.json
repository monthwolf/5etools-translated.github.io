Examples from other published D&D settings include the following:": "如果你不是在进行 \"被遗忘的世界 \"战役，你可以将本书中的冒险故事改编为其他环境，用任何类似于 \"烛台 \"的大型图书馆代替。其他已出版的D&D环境中的例子包括如下。",

	"The Candlekeep Mysteries table summarizes the adventures in this anthology. Each adventure is designed for four to six characters of a particular level, but you can adjust it for larger or smaller groups as well as for characters of higher or lower level by swapping one monster or trap for another, changing the number of foes in an encounter, and adjusting DCs to make important tasks easier or harder for the characters to accomplish.": "烛台之谜》表格总结了本文集中的冒险。每个冒险都是为四到六个特定级别的角色设计的，但你可以通过用一个怪物或陷阱替换另一个怪物或陷阱，改变遭遇战中的敌人数量，以及调整DC以使角色更容易或更难完成重要任务，来为更大或更小的团体以及更高或更低的角色进行调整。",

	"These short adventures work best with players who like mysteries and discovering their secrets. That said, each adventure contains opportunities for exploration, roleplaying, and combat, to appeal to players of all persuasions.": "这些短小的冒险对喜欢神秘和发现秘密的玩家来说效果最好。也就是说，每个冒险都包含了探索、角色扮演和战斗的机会，以吸引各种倾向的玩家。",

	"The {@book Monster Manual|MM} contains stat blocks for most of the creatures encountered in these adventures. When a creature's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block as a way of saying, \"Hey, DM, get this creature's stat block ready. You'll need it.\" If a stat block is new, the adventure's text tells you where to find it.": "{@book Monster Manual|MM}包含这些冒险中遇到的大多数生物的状态块。当一个生物的名字以{@b bold}类型出现时，那是一个视觉提示，指向你的状态块，作为一种说法，\"嘿，管理员，把这个生物的状态块准备好。你会需要它的。\" 如果一个状态块是新的，冒险的文本会告诉你在哪里找到它。",
	"Before running an adventure with a new group of players, have a candid out-of-game conversation with them about hard and soft limits on what topics can be broached in-game. Your players might have phobias and triggers you aren't aware of. Any topic or theme that makes a player feel unsafe should be avoided. If a topic or theme makes one or more players nervous but they give you consent to include it in-game, incorporate it with care. Be ready to move away from such topics and themes quickly if a problem crops up. It's okay for characters to feel stressed and anxious, but your players should be relaxed and having fun.": "在与一组新的玩家进行冒险之前，与他们进行一次坦诚的游戏外对话，讨论在游戏中可以讨论的话题的软硬限制。你的玩家可能有恐惧症和你不知道的触发器。任何让玩家感到不安全的话题或主题都应该被避免。如果一个话题或主题让一个或多个玩家感到紧张，但他们同意在游戏中加入这个话题，请谨慎地加入这个话题。如果出现问题，要准备好迅速离开这些话题和主题。角色感到压力和焦虑是可以的，但你的玩家应该是放松的，并且有乐趣。",
	"You can dissect an adventure and use pieces of it rather than the whole thing. Nothing in these adventures is too sacred to tamper with and repurpose to serve your own needs.": "你可以剖析一个冒险，使用它的碎片而不是整个东西。在这些冒险中，没有什么东西是神圣的，可以篡改和重新利用来满足你自己的需要。",
	"Most of the locations described in this book can be used as stand-alone adventure sites. With a little effort and a few name changes, you can transplant them into other campaign worlds, including your own.": "本书中描述的大多数地点都可以作为独立的冒险地点。只要稍加努力，改变一下名称，你就可以把它们移植到其他活动世界中，包括你自己的世界。",
	"Take the Lykortha Expanse, a cave network that figures prominently in one of this book's adventures. You could situate these caves in any wilderness or Underdark setting where fungi are likely to be found in abundance. You can also modify the villain and its goals to better support an ongoing story or threat in your campaign. Conversely, you could remove the villain, keep the map, and repopulate the Lykortha Expanse with creatures that better suit the characters' level or the particular story you want to tell. Sometimes a good map is all a DM needs!": "就拿莱科萨山脉（Lykortha Expanse）来说，这是一个洞穴网络，在本书的一次冒险中占据了重要地位。你可以把这些洞穴放在任何可能发现大量真菌的荒野或地下城环境中。你也可以修改小人和它的目标，以更好地支持你的活动中正在进行的故事或威胁。反过来说，你也可以去掉小人，保留地图，然后用更适合人物水平或你想讲的特定故事的生物重新填充莱科萨大草原。有时候，一张好的地图就是管理员所需要的一切",
	"The world of the Forgotten Realms is one of high fantasy, populated by elves, dwarves, halflings, humans, and other folk. Steel-hearted adventurers from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages follow tales that take them to strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can carry inexperienced youths with dreams of glory far across the world, but these paths are never safe. Traveling throughout the Realms invites the perils of fell magic and deadly monsters. Farms and freeholds within a day's walk of a city might fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.": "被遗忘的世界是一个高度幻想的世界，居住着精灵、矮人、半身人、人类和其他民族。来自乡间农庄和沉睡村庄的铁血冒险家们追随故事，将他们带到陌生、光荣、遥远的地方。好的地图和清晰的小路可以带着没有经验的年轻人，带着荣耀的梦想远走他乡，但这些道路从来都不安全。在整个王国中旅行会招致堕落的魔法和致命的怪物的危险。离城市一天路程的农场和土地可能会成为怪物的猎物，没有一个地方是安全的，不会受到龙的突然愤怒的攻击。",
	"Details about the history and nature of the Realms fill volumes, and much of that knowledge resides in books and scrolls sealed in Candlekeep's vaults. For a detailed description of Candlekeep, see the next section. This product also includes a foldout poster that features an illustration of the library-fortress.": "关于王国的历史和性质的细节充满了卷轴，这些知识大部分都存在于封存在Candlekeep保险库的书籍和卷轴中。关于Candlekeep的详细描述，见下一节。本产品还包括一张折叠式海报，上面有图书馆堡垒的插图。",
	"In the Forgotten Realms setting, a week is ten days long and is referred to as a tenday. There are three tendays in a month and twelve months in a year.

	"Standing atop a rocky crag overlooking the Sea of Swords, the massive citadel of Candlekeep has endured the elements for centuries and defied the degradations of time. Visible for miles around, Candlekeep has an eye-catching silhouette: a high wall interspersed with towers. This wall encloses a large space from which more towers rise. Those who behold the edifice say it looks like nothing so much as a cake decorated with an overabundance of candles.": "矗立在俯瞰剑海的岩石峭壁上，巨大的烛台堡垒经受住了几个世纪的风吹雨打，抵御了时间的退化。烛龙城在方圆几英里内都能看到，它有一个醒目的轮廓：一堵高墙夹杂着塔楼。这堵墙包围着一个大空间，更多的塔楼从这里升起。那些看到这座建筑的人说，它看起来就像一个用过多的蜡烛装饰的蛋糕。",

The route follows a lonely path across the peninsula where Candlekeep stands.": "烛台镇的入口是一道双门，矗立在狮子之路的尽头，这是唯一一条可以进出外部世界的道路。这条路沿着一条孤独的小路穿过烛龙镇所在的半岛。",
	"Those who gain entry discover a cloistered community of scholars milling around inside Candlekeep's walls, a place of enlightened conversation and friendly debate. No better place in the Realms exists for those who have a love for or a need of knowledge and who want to pursue such interests alongside fellow seekers.": "进入这里的人发现，在烛龙城的城墙内有一个由学者组成的隐秘社区，这是一个充满启迪性对话和友好辩论的地方。对于那些热爱或需要知识的人来说，在王国中没有比这更好的地方了，他们希望与其他追求者一起追求这种兴趣。",
	"Candlekeep has the largest repository of written lore in Faerûn, including the collected prophecies of an ancient sage named Alaundo the Seer. Those compiled divinations make up a tiny fraction of the accumulated knowledge and secrets contained in the library's vast collection.": "烛龙镇拥有法鲁恩最大的书面传说库，包括一位名叫阿伦多预言家的古代圣人所收集的预言。这些汇编的预言只占图书馆庞大藏书中积累的知识和秘密的极小部分。",
	"Not all knowledge preserved in Candlekeep is of historical importance. The library holds thousands upon thousands of lost recipes, old songs, collections of folklore, and journals written by folks whose time has long since passed. The abundance of these ancillary works makes finding notable tomes an exercise in patience and perseverance. Fortunately, a legion of scholars and sages called the Avowed look after the library and remain vigilant in the care and cataloging of all the knowledge it holds.": "并非所有保存在Candlekeep的知识都具有历史意义。图书馆里保存着数以千计的失传食谱、老歌、民间传说集，以及那些时代早已过去的人们写的日记。这些附属作品的数量之多，使得寻找著名的书籍成为一项需要耐心和毅力的工作。幸运的是，一个被称为 \"圣人 \"的学者和圣人军团照看着这个图书馆，并对它所拥有的所有知识保持着警惕和分类。",

	"Those admitted to Candlekeep, referred to as seekers, can request the assistance of an Avowed adjutant who acts as a guide and research assistant for the duration of their visit. This guide has access to all the resources of the library, with the exception of the vaults that contain the rarest and most dangerous works. Seekers can appeal to higher-ranking Avowed for permission to peruse these off-limits works.": "那些被允许进入Candlekeep的人，被称为寻求者，可以请求一位Avowed副官的帮助，他在访问期间充当向导和研究助理。这位向导可以接触到图书馆的所有资源，但存放最稀有和最危险作品的地下室除外。探索者可以向更高等级的Avowed提出申请，以获得阅读这些禁区作品的许可。",

	"Numerous magical defenses protect the library. The most innocuous include wards to protect the library's books from mold, weevils, and other threats. Other protections are more dramatic, as discussed below.": "众多的魔法防御措施保护着图书馆。最无害的包括保护图书馆的书籍不受霉菌、象鼻虫和其他威胁的守护。其他的保护措施则更具有戏剧性，如下文所述。",
	"Wards prevent anyone from entering Candlekeep by any route other than through the front gates. Any attempt to magically bypass these gates fails. These wards do not prevent creatures from using magic to exit Candlekeep.": "警卫阻止任何人通过前门以外的任何途径进入烛台镇。任何试图用魔法绕过这些门的行为都会失败。这些守卫并不能阻止生物使用魔法离开烛台镇。",
	"Anyone who tries to fly over the wall into Candlekeep is stopped short. Magical flight is dispelled, and the subject floats slowly to the ground fifty feet outside the gates. An intangible ward forces creatures that can fly naturally to either land or circumnavigate Candlekeep altogether. Ordinary birds are unaffected by this ward, and a clever wizard or other individual can bypass the ward by assuming the form of a Tiny bird. The Avowed don't discuss this flaw with outsiders, but anyone who can see the gulls flying over Candlekeep can easily reach the conclusion that certain creatures are exempt from this magical restriction. ": "任何试图飞越围墙进入烛龙镇的人都会被阻止。神奇的飞行被驱散了，当事人会缓慢地漂浮到门外50英尺的地面上。一个无形的防护罩迫使能够自然飞行的生物要么降落，要么完全绕过烛台镇。普通的鸟类不受这个防护罩的影响，聪明的巫师或其他个人可以通过化身为小鸟的形式来绕过这个防护罩。阿维德人不与外人讨论这个缺陷，但任何能看到海鸥在烛台镇上空飞翔的人都能轻易得出结论，某些生物可以不受这个魔法限制。",
	"Flames larger than a candle are suppressed within the keep. (The fireplace in the Hearth, Candlekeep's tavern, is an exception.) Thus, any spell that creates fire is wasted if it is cast within the keep.": "大于蜡烛的火焰在堡垒内会受到抑制。(烛台镇酒馆的壁炉是个例外。)因此，任何创造火焰的法术如果在堡垒内施放都会被浪费。",
	"Every book, scroll, and other work considered part of Candlekeep's collection is magically protected against theft. Any such work that is removed from the keep disappears and immediately returns to its proper place in the library.": "每本书籍、卷轴和其他被视为Candlekeep收藏品的作品都受到神奇的保护，不会被盗。任何被移出保管所的作品都会消失，并立即回到其在图书馆的适当位置。",
	"This ward also has a flaw that the Avowed don't discuss with outsiders. If pages from a book or parts of a scroll are torn away, these fragments can be removed from Candlekeep as long as the bulk of the work remains in the library. Similarly, if a work is split into pieces and entirely removed from Candlekeep, only the largest piece disappears and returns to its proper place in the library.": "这个病房也有一个缺陷，\"神赐者 \"不与外人讨论。如果一本书的书页或卷轴的一部分被撕掉了，只要作品的大部分还在图书馆里，这些碎片就可以从Candlekeep中取出。同样地，如果一部作品被分割成碎片并完全从烛台上移走，只有最大的碎片会消失，并回到它在图书馆的适当位置。",
	"From any location in Candlekeep, the Keeper of Tomes (see \"{@area The Avowed|01a|x}\" later in this section) can activate a mythal—an exceptional, unbreakable magical effect—that envelops all of Candlekeep in a protective shield through which nothing but air and sound can pass.": "在烛台镇的任何地方，通书守护者（见本节后面的\"{@area The Avowed|01a|x}\"）都可以激活一个神话--一种特殊的、无法打破的魔法效果--将整个烛台镇笼罩在一个保护罩中，除了空气和声音，没有任何东西可以穿过。",
	"All who enter Candlekeep must agree to the Orders of Accordance, rules set forth by the senior staff to prevent misconduct. Violating one or more of these orders results in banishment from Candlekeep, and the banished are seldom allowed to return. The rules are simple:": "所有进入Candlekeep的人都必须同意 \"协调令\"，这是高级职员为防止不当行为而制定的规则。违反其中一条或多条命令，将被驱逐出烛台镇，被驱逐者很少被允许返回。规则很简单。",
	"All arguments must follow the rules of cordial debate and discussion. Violent altercations are not tolerated.": "所有的争论必须遵循亲切的辩论和讨论的规则。暴力争吵是不能容忍的。",
	"This rule applies to all objects in the keep, not just the library's works.": "这一规则适用于保存的所有对象，而不仅仅是图书馆的作品。",
	"Visitors are permitted to take notes while studying the library's works, but anyone who wants to make a full copy of a work must pay to have the manuscript created by scribes at the House of the Binder.": "参观者在研究图书馆的作品时可以做笔记，但任何想对作品进行完整复制的人都必须付费，由装订者之家的抄写员来制作手稿。",
	"This rule doesn't apply to privately owned books, scrolls, and other documents that aren't part of Candlekeep's collection.": "这条规则不适用于私人拥有的书籍、卷轴和其他不属于Candlekeep收藏的文件。",
	"If no gender or alignment is specified for a nonplayer character in Candlekeep, you can choose that NPC's gender identity and alignment.": "如果在Candlekeep中没有为非玩家角色指定性别或结盟，你可以选择该NPC的性别身份和结盟。",

	"Roughly three hundred Avowed live in Candlekeep. The majority of them are low-level assistants, newcomers to the order, or scribes who handle the everyday work in the keep (use the {@creature commoner} stat block to represent them).": "大约有三百名 \"阿沃德 \"信徒住在烛台镇。他们中的大多数人都是低级的助手、新加入的人，或者是处理守卫区日常工作的文士（用{@creature commoner}状态块来表示他们）。",
	"High-ranking members of the Avowed include the individuals described below.": "阿瓦维德的高级成员包括以下个人。",
	"The Keeper is the highest-ranking member of the Avowed and the governor of Candlekeep, who selects scholars to fill vacant leadership positions. The Keeper's word is law, and each Keeper's edicts are recorded for the edification of future Keepers.": "守护者是 \"神赐者 \"中地位最高的成员，也是烛台镇的长官，他挑选学者来填补空缺的领导职位。守护者的话就是法律，每个守护者的命令都会被记录下来，供未来的守护者参考。",
	"A Keeper of Tomes chooses their own replacement. If a Keeper dies or departs before making that choice, the council of Great Readers votes to determine who among them is elevated to the position. Tie votes are broken by the First Reader.": "通书守护者选择自己的替代者。如果守护者在做出选择之前死亡或离开，大阅读者委员会将投票决定他们中谁将被提升到这个位置。票数相同的情况下，由第一朗读者打破。",

In addition to comfortable lodgings, the House of Rest offers guests peace and quiet. Noisy patrons are directed to the Hearth if they want to continue their revels.": "这座位于空气之庭的三层楼房为寻求者提供了一个休息和储存装备的地方。质朴的住宿条件包括私人房间和公共房间。除了舒适的住宿外，\"休息之家 \"还为客人提供和平和安静。吵闹的客人如果想继续狂欢，会被引导到壁炉。",
	"The House of Rest can hold up to fifty guests comfortably. If more space is needed, extradimensional spaces are created using {@spell Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion} spells, the doorways to which are located at the ends of the upstairs hallways.

	"All magic depends on the Weave, an interface between casters and raw magic that is governed by Mystra, god of magic. Arcane spellcasters access the Weave directly, while divine spellcasters are granted access to it by their deities and ideals. Damage to the Weave can cause unimaginable destruction, as evidenced by the Spellplague in 1385 DR, the Year of Blue Fire.": "所有的魔法都依赖于 \"编织\"，这是施法者和原始魔法之间的接口，由魔法之神Mystra管理。奥术施法者可以直接接触到 \"编织\"，而神圣的施法者则由他们的神灵和理想授予其使用权。对织网的破坏会造成难以想象的破坏，正如公元1385年蓝火之年的法术瘟疫所证明的那样。",
	"Some scholars believe that Malar, god of the hunt, is responsible for lycanthropy. Mazfroth disagrees with this theory on the basis that not all lycanthropes are evil as Malar is. Werebears are an example of lycanthropes that are usually good.": "一些学者认为，狩猎之神马拉尔是狼人的罪魁祸首。马兹弗洛特不同意这一理论，理由是并非所有的狼人都像马拉尔一样邪恶。狼人是狼人的一个例子，他们通常是好的。",
	"The Abyss is ruled by demon lords—Baphomet, Demogorgon, Graz'zt, Juiblex, Orcus, Yeenoghu, Zuggtmoy, and many others. Mazfroth ties the origins of several monsters to these demon lords (saying Juiblex created all oozes, for example).": "深渊由恶魔领主统治--巴弗梅特（Baphomet）、德莫戈贡（Demogorgon）、格拉兹兹特（Graz'zt）、朱布勒克斯（Juiblex）、奥库斯（Orcus）、耶诺古（Yeenoghu）、祖格莫伊（Zuggtmoy）和其他许多恶魔。马兹弗罗斯将一些怪物的起源与这些恶魔领主联系在一起（例如，他说尤布勒克斯创造了所有的乌兹）。",
	"A {@creature gingwatzim|CM} is a peculiar form of life created by a spell or a ritual. The magic that brings it into being draws on spirit energy from the Ethereal Plane to give the gingwatzim its true form—that of a luminous (but not too bright) sphere of ectoplasm roughly 3 feet in diameter. A newly formed gingwatzim appears as near to its creator as possible and follows its creator's commands without question, using telepathy to communicate.": "{@creature gingwatzim|CM}是一种由法术或仪式创造的奇特的生命形式。使其产生的魔法从虚空界汲取精神能量，使Gingwatzim拥有真正的形态--一个发光的（但不是太亮）外质球体，直径约为3英尺。一个新形成的Gingwatzim会尽可能地靠近它的创造者，并毫不犹豫地听从它的创造者的命令，用心灵感应进行交流。",
	"A gingwatzim can assume two other forms that are determined by its creator at the time the gingwatzim comes into being. One is an exact duplicate of a Tiny nonmagical object that its creator is wearing or carrying. The gingwatzim's other form is that of a specific Tiny beast.": "gingwatzim可以变成另外两种形式，由其创造者在gingwatzim产生时决定。一种是它的创造者所穿戴或携带的微小非魔法物品的精确复制品。gingwatzim的另一个形态是一个特定的小兽的形态。",
	"When the {@creature gingwatzim|CM} that has taken the form of {@i Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions} attacks the characters, it does so by assuming its true form and then using its Energy Drain action. A gingwatzim must feed on the life energy of other creatures to survive, but it can't feed while in the form of a beast or an object, which is why it must revert to its true form first. Its other form is that of a bat.": "当{@creature gingwatzim|CM}变成{@i Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions}的形态攻击角色时，它的做法是变成它的真实形态，然后使用它的能量耗尽动作。Gingwatzim必须以其他生物的生命能量为食才能生存，但它在变成野兽或物体的形态时无法进食，这就是为什么它必须先恢复到它的真实形态。它的另一种形态是蝙蝠的形态。",
	"The gingwatzim that attacks the characters was created by a jackalwere named Korvala, using a ritual taught to her by a now-deceased lamia named Nidalia. Korvala is the leader of the Amberdune Pack, a gang of jackalweres that sells books and scrolls in the markets of Baldur's Gate. Korvala commanded the gingwatzim to take the form of {@i Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions}, one of the more valuable books in her collection. This ruse enabled her to sell a copy of the book without giving up the genuine item, which Korvala is loath to part with.": "攻击这些人物的Gingwatzim是由一个名叫Korvala的豺狼人创造的，使用的是一个现已去世的名叫Nidalia的拉米亚教给她的仪式。科瓦拉是安柏杜恩小组的领导人，该小组由豺狼人组成，在博德之门的市场上出售书籍和卷轴。科瓦拉命令金瓦兹姆变成{@i Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions}的样子，这是她收藏中比较有价值的书籍之一。这个诡计使她能够在不放弃真品的情况下出售该书的副本，而科瓦拉不愿意放弃这本书。",
	"The Amberdune Pack remains fiercely loyal to Nidalia, even though she has been dead for months. Rather than corrupting individuals and acquiring slaves, Nidalia preferred to collect books and scrolls. Though she was peaceful and compassionate, she was nonetheless killed by a group of adventurers. The jackalweres that survived fled with Nidalia's heart and what books and scrolls they could carry.": "尽管尼达利亚已经死了几个月，但安柏杜恩族群仍然对她保持着强烈的忠诚。比起腐蚀个人和获取奴隶，尼达利亚更喜欢收集书籍和卷轴。虽然她很和平，也很有同情心，但她还是被一群冒险家杀害了。活下来的豺狼人带着尼达利亚的心脏和他们能携带的书籍和卷轴逃走了。",
	"With Korvala as their new leader, the pack began working on a way to resurrect Nidalia. It soon became clear that wouldn't be a simple task. After all, the {@spell resurrection} spell requires both a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp and the services of a sufficiently powerful spellcaster.": "随着科瓦拉成为他们的新领袖，这个族群开始研究复活尼达利亚的方法。很快就发现这不是一个简单的任务。毕竟，{@spell resurrection}的咒语需要价值至少1000金币的钻石和一个足够强大的施法者的服务。",
	"The pack's plan to sell books and scrolls, as well as gingwatzims disguised as books and scrolls, proved to be more challenging than they expected. Most of their profits are spent to help them survive in a city with more than its fair share of bribery and corruption. They've pinned their hopes on raising enough money to resurrect Nidalia before someone discovers their ruse, but they didn't account for the possibility that some of their gingwatzims would end up in Candlekeep.": "这群人的计划是销售书籍和卷轴，以及伪装成书籍和卷轴的gingwatzims，事实证明，这比他们预期的更具挑战性。他们的大部分利润都用来帮助他们在这个充满贿赂和腐败的城市生存。他们把希望寄托在筹集足够的资金，在有人发现他们的诡计之前复活尼达利亚，但他们没有考虑到他们的一些gingwatzims最终会出现在烛台镇的可能性。",

	"She purchased her book from a market stall in the Wide, a bustling marketplace in the Upper City of Baldur's Gate. She doesn't remember much about the stall because she didn't want to stay in the Wide for too long.

	"After finding the information she needed, she prepared to leave three days ago. That's when the Avowed informed her that her gift, {@i The Dark Hunger}, had revealed its true form, attacking and destroying a wizard's homunculus. The wizard killed the monster before it could harm anyone else, but not before it turned into a spider and tried to scuttle away. When the monster died, no trace of it was left behind.": "在找到她需要的信息后，她准备在三天前离开。就在这时，\"先知 \"告诉她，她的天赋，{@i The Dark Hunger}，暴露了它的真面目，攻击并摧毁了一个巫师的同体人。巫师在怪物伤害别人之前就把它杀死了，但在它变成蜘蛛并试图逃跑之前。当怪物死后，没有留下任何痕迹。",
	"From Candlekeep, it takes five days of travel along the Coast Way to reach Baldur's Gate. Bandits and thugs lurk along this road, waiting to ambush anyone carrying rare books or other valuables.": "从烛台镇出发，沿着海岸路需要五天的时间才能到达博德之门。土匪和暴徒潜伏在这条路上，等待着伏击携带珍稀书籍或其他贵重物品的人。",
	"The marketplace known as the Wide is located in the Upper City—home to the patriars, the wealthiest citizens of Baldur's Gate. Visitors to this district find streets illuminated by magical lights, luxurious boutiques, and expensive restaurants. The elegantly dressed residents treat poorer people with great disdain. The Upper City is truly a place of exclusive decadence; a nightly curfew means that those who don't live there must leave at nightfall each day unless they have a special token.": "被称为Wide的市场位于上城--博德之门最富有的市民--的家。来到这个区的游客会发现街道被神奇的灯光照亮，豪华的精品店和昂贵的餐厅。衣着优雅的居民对贫穷的人非常不屑一顾。上城确实是一个独特的颓废之地；每晚的宵禁意味着那些不住在那里的人必须在每天夜幕降临时离开，除非他们有特殊的信物。",
	"Almost anything can be found in the Wide. Vendors can operate here without official licenses and taxation, as long as their wares are legal. Even so, the Wide is not immune to corruption: hefty bribes and reputations determine where every vendor is situated in the marketplace.": "几乎任何东西都可以在Wide中找到。只要他们的商品是合法的，供应商可以在这里经营，不需要官方许可和征税。即便如此，广域也不能避免腐败：巨额贿赂和声誉决定了每个商贩在市场上的位置。",

The last two pages are blank.": "在书的末尾，作者写到可以拄着拐杖蹒跚而行。她描述了当维斯坦尼商队沿着蜿蜒的山路来到一座高大、黑暗的城堡门前时，她的恩人的愉快心情。书的结尾描述了城堡可怕的面容。文字在倒数第三页突然停止，表明这本书是在作者说到一半时被抢走的。最后两页是空白的。",

Two former residents of Vermeillon can share their experiences: Lukas Grosvenor, the owner of the Bored Weasel tavern and inn, and Astra Vorn, a flower vendor in the market.": "大多数梅林的公民对隐藏在他们头上的山中的村庄知之甚少。有两位前韦尔梅隆的居民可以分享他们的经验。卢卡斯-格罗夫纳（Lukas Grosvenor），无聊的黄鼠狼酒馆和客栈的老板，以及阿斯特拉-沃恩（Astra Vorn），市场上的一个花贩。",
	"For a long-term campaign, you have the option of reopening the mine once the party clears out the nest of meenlocks. Plenty of platinum lies in the ground near Vermeillon, and adventurers who make it accessible could be rewarded with a share of the mine's profits once production starts up again. Vermeillon as a potential home base or means of additional income could be an irresistible temptation for forward-thinking groups. Either Lukas or Astra in Maerin mentions this possibility in passing, if needed, though neither claims any knowledge of where to find the rightful owners.": "对于一个长期的活动，你可以选择在队伍清除了米恩锁的巢穴后重新开放矿场。维尔梅隆附近的地下蕴藏着大量的铂金，一旦生产重新开始，让人们接触到铂金的冒险者可以得到矿场利润的一部分作为奖励。维尔梅隆作为一个潜在的大本营或额外收入的手段，对有远见的团体来说是一个不可抗拒的诱惑力。如果需要的话，在Maerin的Lukas或Astra都顺便提到了这种可能性，尽管他们都没有声称知道在哪里可以找到合法的主人。",

	"Astra was a child when their family left Vermeillon, so their knowledge of the forgotten village is clouded by time and the hazy memories of the very young.

	"A double bed sits beneath the windows along the far wall. A fireplace occupies one corner, and a window looks out onto the front yard.": "沿着远处的墙壁，一张双人床坐在窗户下面。一个壁炉占据了一个角落，一扇窗户向外看是前院。",
	"This room belonged to Mayor Duvezin and her wife, Tifra. A search of the room yields a pile of crumpled, half-written letters on the fireplace mantelpiece, beseeching other nearby settlements for aid; among them is a completed letter addressed to the mayor of Maerin. This letter is stuffed in an envelope and sealed shut with a bright red wax seal embossed with an ornate snowdrop blossom; sticks of sealing wax in various colors as well as quills, ink, and paper; and the journal of Mayor Lei Duvezin.": "这个房间属于杜维新市长和她的妻子蒂芙拉。在房间里搜索，发现壁炉壁架上有一堆皱巴巴的、写了一半的信，恳求附近其他定居点提供援助；其中有一封写完的信，是写给梅林市长的。这封信被塞在一个信封里，用印有华丽的雪绒花的鲜红色蜡封封住；还有各种颜色的封蜡棒以及羽毛笔、墨水和纸张；以及雷-杜维津市长的日记。",
	"The journal chronicles the disaster at the mine and the village's anguish at so many victims. The mayor recounts the rescue efforts in the following days, and how they had to stop the search due to fears of more cave-ins if they attempted to remove any more of the rubble, even with miners still missing. She writes of villagers going missing in the night, of her helplessness, and of stubbornly staying on, determined to find the missing villagers while Tifra and their two children, Tavin and Nia, evacuated to Maerin. The last few pages speak of the mayor's nightmares, of her creeping fear and waking in the night, soaked in sweat, with lingering screams echoing in her ears.": "这本日记记录了矿场的灾难和村里人对这么多受害者的痛苦。村长讲述了随后几天的救援工作，以及由于担心如果他们试图清除更多的废墟，甚至在矿工仍然失踪的情况下，他们不得不停止搜索。她写到村民在夜里失踪，写到她的无助，写到她顽强地坚持下去，决心找到失踪的村民，而提夫拉和他们的两个孩子塔文和尼娅则疏散到麦林。最后几页讲到村长的噩梦，讲到她的恐惧和在夜里醒来时汗流浃背，耳边回荡着挥之不去的尖叫声。",

The wide bank of windows in the south wall affords a panoramic view of the dilapidated houses beyond the twisting branches of the tree in the front yard.": "书房的墙壁上摆满了书架，四把靠背椅围着房间中央的矮桌坐着。南墙的宽大窗户将前院扭曲的树枝外的破旧房屋一览无余。",
	"Since the village's business was conducted on the first floor of the mansion, the mayor and her wife spent their personal time in this room. The shelves hold books of all sorts, from tomes on history and treatises on business to thin volumes of folktales and grand, sweeping novels. An entire section on arcane theory includes books about the other planes of existence. If you so desire, the library can include books relevant to other plots in your campaign.": "由于村里的事务是在大宅的一楼进行的，村长和她的妻子在这个房间里度过他们的私人时间。书架上摆放着各种书籍，从历史书和商业论文到薄薄的民间故事和宏大的小说。整个奥秘理论部分包括关于其他存在平面的书籍。如果你愿意，图书馆可以包括与你的活动中的其他情节有关的书籍。",
	"Several open books lie on the table, with notes scribbled on bits of paper stuck between their pages. The topics include the effects of physical and emotional trauma, nightmares, and mysterious disappearances. Seemingly out of place in comparison to the other topics, a book about the Feywild and its sundry creatures holds a single note, written in a shaky hand. It reads: {@i Could this be the answer?}": "桌子上躺着几本打开的书，书页之间夹着潦草的纸片。主题包括身体和情感创伤的影响、恶梦和神秘的失踪。与其他主题相比，一本关于精灵世界及其各种生物的书似乎显得格格不入，上面有一张纸条，用颤抖的手写的。它写道。{@i Could this be the answer?}",

	"Meenlocks are sensitive to bright light and can sense shadows and darkness.": "Meenlocks对亮光很敏感，并能感觉到阴影和黑暗。",
	"By the time Mayor Duvezin discovered this book, she was already being harried by the meenlocks. They took her shortly afterward.": "当杜维新市长发现这本书的时候，她已经被meenlocks的人骚扰了。他们不久后就把她带走了。",

	"Intended as a guest bedroom, this chamber rarely saw much use.": "这间屋子本来是作为客人的卧室，但很少有人使用。",
	"This bedroom has a tall chest of drawers made of dark wood in the corner across from the door. Farther into the room, a small desk sits between two windows, with a large bed to the left of it. The sheets and blankets on the bed are rumpled. One moth-eaten pillow lies on the floor beside it, the other on the mattress where it belongs.": "这间卧室在门对面的角落里有一个深色木材制成的高大抽屉柜。在房间的更远处，一张小书桌坐落在两扇窗户之间，左边是一张大床。床上的床单和毯子都皱巴巴的。一个被虫蛀的枕头躺在旁边的地板上，另一个躺在床垫上，这是它的位置。",
	"Under the bed is a small stuffed toy bugbear, full of holes and with its stuffing removed by the resident rodents. It belonged to the mayor's son, Tavin.": "床下有一个小的毛绒玩具虫子，满是洞，里面的填充物被居住的啮齿动物拿走了。它属于市长的儿子，塔文。",
	"A gaping hole in the mountainside northeast of the village marks the entrance to the platinum mine. Several carts sit outside the cavern. One is filled with rock and dirt pulled from the mine, the others piled with large beams of wood—new supports that were never installed after the collapse.": "村庄东北部山坡上的一个缺口标志着铂金矿的入口。洞口外坐着几辆推车。其中一辆装满了从矿场拉来的岩石和泥土，其他的则堆满了大木梁--崩塌后从未安装的新支架。",
	"If the characters explore during the day, the first 30 feet inside the mine are dimly lit, and anything beyond 30 feet is in darkness. Cart wheels have carved shallow ruts in the dirt floor leading to the back of the mine, where the cave-in was never fully excavated. Smaller tunnels branch off from the main shaft. The entrance to the meenlock tunnel opens near the site of the accident.": "如果人物在白天探索，矿井内前30英尺的地方光线昏暗，30英尺以外的地方则处于黑暗之中。车轮在通往矿井后面的土层上刻下了浅浅的车辙，那里的洞口从未被完全挖掘出来。较小的隧道从主井中分支出来。meenlock隧道的入口在事故发生地附近打开。",
	"The following locations are keyed to the map of the platinum mine.": "以下地点是以铂金矿的地图为关键。",
	"The mine is dark and damp, and you hear the sound of dripping water echoing from deep within. The light fades faster than it should as you move deeper, until you're wrapped in oppressive gloom and shadow.": "矿井是黑暗和潮湿的，你听到滴水的声音从深处回荡。随着你的深入，光线消失得比它应该的快，直到你被包裹在压抑的阴暗和阴影中。",
	"The main tunnel heads into the mountain, ending at a pile of rubble left over from the cave-in. Secondary hallways branch off to the left and the right. The meenlocks, having watched the characters in the village, escalate their psychic torment when the characters enter the mine.": "主通道往山里走，在山洞里留下的一堆碎石处结束。次要的走廊向左和向右延伸。当人物进入矿井时，在村子里观察过人物的meenlocks就会加强对他们的精神折磨。",
	"Each character who enters the mine must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks from being distracted by whispers, shifting movement, and other hallucinations while inside the mine.": "每个进入矿井的角色必须在DC14智慧救赎上获得成功，否则在矿井内被耳语、移动变化和其他幻觉所干扰，在智力和智慧检查上处于不利地位。",
	"This tunnel ends at a small chamber that holds worn picks, rusty shovels, and two hand carts filled with debris and rags.": "这条隧道的尽头是一个小室，里面放着破旧的镐、生锈的铲子和两辆装满杂物和破布的手推车。",
	"The tools were left behind by the workers in the wake of the disaster.": "这些工具是工人们在灾难发生后留下的。",
	"This tunnel winds back toward the entrance, and the south wall of the chamber at the end has odd divots and alcoves within the rock at various heights.": "这条隧道向入口处蜿蜒而去，尽头处密室的南墙在不同高度的岩石内有奇怪的凹陷和凹槽。",
	"This tunnel ends abruptly. The miners intended to keep digging here, but it was abandoned after the collapse occurred.": "这条隧道戛然而止。矿工们打算在这里继续挖掘，但塌方发生后就放弃了。",
	"As the characters approach the rubble of the cave-in, they see large rocks in the pathway that they can easily move past. The tunnel gets tighter and tighter until they come to the main body of the cave-in.": "当人物接近洞口的瓦砾时，他们看到通道中的大石块，他们可以很容易地走过去。通道越来越紧，直到他们来到塌陷区的主体。",
	"Mounds of broken rock block the tunnel, piled from ceiling to floor. The other parts of the cave-in were passable after the collapse, but this seems an impenetrable wall of earth.": "成堆的碎石堵住了隧道，从天花板堆到地板。塌方后，洞口的其他部分还可以通行，但这里似乎是一堵不可逾越的土墙。",
	"Traveling farther down the tunnel is impossible here. A character who attempts to move any of the rocks must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 ({@dice 2d6}) bludgeoning damage as the rubble shifts, falling on them or sliding out from beneath their feet, sending them tumbling.": "在这里不可能沿着隧道走得更远。试图移动任何石头的角色必须在DC15的灵巧救赎中成功，否则就会受到7({@dice 2d6})的重击伤害，因为碎石移位，落在他们身上或从他们脚下滑出，使他们翻滚。",
	"The opening of this tunnel is nearly circular. Black moss covers the walls, floor, and ceiling of the tunnel as far as you can see. Within this tunnel are several branches, all of them covered in the same black moss.": "这条隧道的开口几乎是圆形的。在你能看到的范围内，黑色的苔藓覆盖了隧道的墙壁、地板和天花板。这条隧道内有几个分支，都被同样的黑色苔藓所覆盖。",
	"The notable aspect of this tunnel is the uniform layer of black moss over everything. Characters who scrape the moss away from the rock see that the walls are smooth, not rough-carved by pick and shovel like the rest of the mine. Because the meenlock tunnels spontaneously manifested rather than being dug out, there are no scratch marks or signs of excavation on the walls, floor, or ceiling here. The moss muffles all sound, causing a lack of echoes and creating a sense of claustrophobia.": "这条隧道的显著特点是所有东西上都有一层均匀的黑色苔藓。将苔藓从岩石上刮开的角色看到，墙壁是光滑的，而不是像矿井的其他地方那样由镐和铲子粗略地雕刻而成。由于米恩洛克隧道是自发形成的，而不是被挖出来的，所以这里的墙壁、地板或天花板上没有任何划痕或挖掘的痕迹。苔藓掩盖了所有的声音，导致缺乏回声，并创造了一种幽闭恐惧症的感觉。",
	"Thick, velvety black moss covers every surface of this eight-foot-high chamber. Set into the far wall is a deep alcove.": "厚厚的、天鹅绒般的黑色苔藓覆盖了这个八英尺高的房间的每一个表面。镶嵌在远处墙壁上的是一个深深的凹槽。",
	"A character who wanders into this cave alone and is {@condition grappled} by the mossy tentacles might have to deal with one or more {@creature Meenlock|VGM|meenlocks} that creep into the room, hoping to take advantage of the character's unfortunate predicament.": "独自闯入这个洞穴并被苔藓触手{@condition grappled}的角色可能要对付一个或多个{@creature Meenlock|VGM|meenlocks}爬进房间，希望利用这个角色的不幸困境。",
	"The meenlocks like to pick off interlopers in this moss-covered maze of tunnels, luring them into dead-end caves using hallucinations (such as the sound of someone calling for help).": "在这个布满青苔的隧道迷宫中，米诺克人喜欢挑衅闯入者，利用幻觉（如有人呼救的声音）将他们引向死胡同。",
	"This dead-end cavern opens wide, and the lingering dampness of the tunnels is pronounced in here. Moisture leaches through the moss ceiling above, forming fat droplets that fall into pools of dark water around the chamber. A sharp scent of minerals fills the air and mixes with the earthy smell of the moss. The sound of dripping doesn't echo, but is immediately dulled by the moss-carpeted surfaces.": "这个死胡同的洞穴开口很大，隧道中挥之不去的潮湿感在这里很明显。水分透过上方的苔藓天花板渗出，形成肥厚的水滴，落入密室周围的黑水潭中。空气中弥漫着一股尖锐的矿物质气味，与苔藓的泥土味混合在一起。滴水的声音没有回音，但立即被铺有苔藓的表面压制住了。",
	"The pools here vary in depth: the smaller ones are a few inches deep, and the larger pools measure 2 feet at their deepest. In the subterranean darkness, the pools look black. Light sources reflect off the water as if it were a dark mirror, and the characters are unable to see below the surface.": "这里的水池深度不同：较小的水池有几英寸深，较大的水池最深处有2英尺。在地下的黑暗中，池子看起来是黑色的。光源在水面上反射，就像一面黑暗的镜子，人物无法看到水面以下。",
	"This is another ideal ambush location for the meenlocks or, if you want to shake things up a bit, for a {@creature black pudding} or other ooze to lurk on the surface of one of the pools like an oil slick.": "这是另一个理想的埋伏地点，如果你想让事情变得更有趣，可以让{@creature black pudding}或其他渗出物像浮油一样潜伏在某个水池的表面。",
	"New scents greet you here: the musty funk of decaying fabric and old furs, and the smell of rot lingering in the stagnant air. Thick pillars of moss-covered stone support the twenty-foot-high ceiling, and waist-high stone slabs dot the cavern.": "新的气味在这里迎接你：腐烂的织物和旧毛皮的霉味，以及在停滞的空气中徘徊的腐烂的气味。覆盖着青苔的厚重石柱支撑着二十英尺高的天花板，齐腰高的石板点缀着洞穴。",
	"The meenlocks bring their victims here to be tormented and transformed. The stone slabs are coated with blood and filth—the result of mortals being laid out for days of torture. Any party members taken by the meenlocks are here, {@condition paralyzed} on one of the slabs if they haven't already been transformed (see the \"{@area Telepathic Torment|17d|x}\" sidebar at the end of the adventure). Any remaining {@creature Meenlock|VGM|meenlocks} attack when the party reaches the center of this room.": "米诺克人把他们的受害者带到这里，接受折磨和改造。石板上涂满了鲜血和污秽--这是凡人被放置数日折磨的结果。任何被术士带走的党员都在这里，{@condition paralyzed}在其中一块石板上，如果他们还没有被转化的话（见冒险结束时的\"{@area Telepathic Torment|17d|x} \"侧边栏）。当队伍到达这个房间的中心时，任何剩余的{@creature Meenlock|VGM|meenlocks}都会攻击。",
	"The remnants of other victims lie on the south side of the room, decades of belongings shed by transformed meenlocks and left to rot. Heaped piles of bones, clothing, boots, rusted blades, and splintered bows and arrows rest within the recessed portions of the walls.": "其他受害者的残余物躺在房间的南面，几十年来被改造过的米诺克斯舍弃的财物，任其腐烂。堆积如山的骨头、衣服、靴子、生锈的刀片和被劈开的弓和箭都在墙壁的凹陷部分。",
	"Meenlocks manifest where the Feywild's influence is strong. A shallow lake on the mountainside above the meenlock lair (directly above {@area area M8|16e|x}) is fed by a stream that becomes a river when summer melts the snow. When the full moon hangs in the night sky, the lake becomes a fey crossing. Anyone who completely submerges in the icy waters during this time surfaces in the Feywild.": "Meenlocks表现在Feywild影响强烈的地方。在米恩洛克巢穴上方的山坡上有一个浅浅的湖泊（就在{@area area M8|16e|x}的正上方），由一条小溪提供水源，当夏天融化积雪时，它就变成了河流。当满月挂在夜空中时，湖泊就会变成一个精灵的渡口。在这段时间里，任何完全淹没在冰水中的人都会浮现在精灵世界。",
	"If the party clears out the nest of meenlocks and informs the citizens of Maerin, settlers restore the village of Vermeillon and the mine eventually begins production again. The new villagers treat the characters as local heroes. As news travels, Tormun and Blenyss eventually hear of the village's resurrection and return to restart their shop, unable to pass up the opportunity of being so close to a platinum mine.": "如果该党派清除了meenlocks的巢穴并通知Maerin的公民，定居者就会恢复Vermeillon村，矿场最终又开始生产。新的村民们把这些人物当作当地的英雄。随着消息的传播，托尔蒙和布莱尼斯最终听说了村子的复活，并回来重新开始他们的商店，他们无法放弃如此接近铂金矿的机会。",
	"If the meenlocks survive, travelers continue to go missing if they attempt to take the road through Vermeillon. The number of meenlocks in the nest grows to eventually threaten the town of Maerin.": "如果meenlocks存活下来，如果旅行者试图通过Vermeillon的道路，他们就会继续失踪。巢穴中的米恩洛克的数量不断增加，最终威胁到梅林镇。",
	"Meenlocks are cruel fey that invoke terror and seek to destroy all that is good, innocent, and beautiful. They primarily live in forests, although they adapt well to urban and subterranean settings.": "Meenlocks是一种残忍的精灵，它们唤起恐怖，并试图摧毁所有善良、无辜和美丽的东西。他们主要生活在森林中，尽管他们很适应城市和地下环境。",
	"Meenlocks are spawned by fear. Whenever fear overwhelms a creature in the Feywild, or in any other location where the Feywild's influence is strong, one or more meenlocks might spontaneously arise in the shadows or darkness nearby. If more than one meenlock is born, a lair also magically forms. The earth creaks and moans as narrow, twisting tunnels open up within it. One of these newly formed passageways serves as the lair's only entrance and exit. Inside the warren, black moss covers every surface, muffling sound. A large central chamber serves as the meenlocks' den, where they torment captives.": "Meenlocks是由恐惧催生的。每当恐惧压倒了仙境中的生物，或在仙境影响强烈的任何其他地方，一个或多个门锁可能会在附近的阴影或黑暗中自发产生。如果有一个以上的门锁诞生，一个巢穴也会神奇地形成。大地嘎吱嘎吱地呻吟着，狭窄、扭曲的隧道在其中打开。这些新形成的通道之一是巢穴的唯一入口和出口。在巢穴内部，黑色的苔藓覆盖了每一个表面，掩盖了声音。一个大的中央房间是米诺克斯的巢穴，他们在那里折磨俘虏。",
	"A meenlock shuns bright light. It can supernaturally sense areas of darkness and shadow in its vicinity and thus is able to teleport from one darkened space to another—enabling it to sneak up on its prey and run away when outmatched.": "米恩锁避开强光。它能超自然地感知周围的黑暗和阴影区域，因此能够从一个黑暗的空间传送到另一个黑暗的空间，使它能够偷袭猎物并在不敌时逃跑。",
	"Meenlocks have no form of communication other than telepathy. They can use it to project unsettling hallucinations into the minds of their prey. These hallucinations take the form of terrible whispers or fleeting movements just at the edges of one's peripheral vision.": "Meenlocks除了心灵感应外没有其他的交流方式。他们可以利用心灵感应将令人不安的幻觉投射到猎物的头脑中。这些幻觉的形式是可怕的低语或在人的周围视野边缘转瞬即逝的运动。",
	"During the day, meenlocks confine themselves to their dark warrens. At night, they crawl out of their tunnels to torment sleeping prey (see the \"Telepathic Torment\" sidebar).": "白天，meenlocks将自己限制在黑暗的巢穴中。到了晚上，他们会从地道里爬出来，折磨沉睡的猎物（见 \"心灵感应的折磨 \"侧栏）。",
	"Up to four meenlocks can telepathically torment one {@condition incapacitated} creature, filling its mind with disturbing sounds and dreadful imagery. Participating meenlocks can't use their telepathy for any other purpose during this time, though they can move about and take actions and reactions as normal. This torment has no effect on a creature that is immune to the {@condition frightened} condition. If the creature is susceptible and remains {@condition incapacitated} for 1 hour, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 10 ({@dice 3d6}) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The save DC is equal to 10 + the number of meenlocks participating in the torment, considering only those that remain within sight of the victim for the entire hour and aren't {@condition incapacitated} during it. The process can be repeated. A humanoid that drops to 0 hit points as a result of this damage instantly transforms into a meenlock at full health and under the DM's control. Only a {@spell wish} spell or divine intervention can restore a transformed creature to its former state.": "最多四个meenlocks可以用心灵感应折磨一个{@condition incapacitated}的生物，用令人不安的声音和可怕的图像填充它的头脑。在这段时间内，参与的meenlocks不能为任何其他目的使用他们的心灵感应，尽管他们可以像正常人一样行动和做出反应。这种折磨对对{@condition frightened}条件免疫的生物没有影响。如果该生物易受影响，并在1小时内保持{@condition incapacitated}的状态，该生物必须进行智慧救赎，如果救赎失败，将受到10({@dice 3d6})的精神伤害，如果救赎成功，将受到一半的伤害。救赎DC等于10+参与折磨的meenlocks的数量，只考虑那些在整个小时内都在受害者视线范围内的，并且在折磨过程中没有{@condition incapacitated}。这个过程可以重复进行。由于这种伤害而下降到0命中率的类人，会立即转化为一个完全健康并受DM控制的meenlock。只有{@spell wish}的法术或神明的干预才能将变身后的生物恢复到以前的状态。",
	"The adventure takes place in the Firefly Cellar, a windowless basement beneath the House of Rest, so named because its only light comes from lamps lit by swarms of fireflies.": "冒险发生在萤火虫地窖，这是安息之家下面一个没有窗户的地下室，因为它唯一的光线来自成群的萤火虫点燃的灯，所以被称为萤火虫地窖。",

They soon discover that the tune has \"spread\" to the Firefly Cellar's other occupants, and the Avowed institute a quarantine to contain what is actually a curse. The adventure is built around a sequence of events that unfold when the characters are quarantined in Candlekeep's Firefly Cellar with a handful of the library's attendants, in an attempt to keep {@creature Shemshime|CM}'s curse from spreading throughout the entire library.

	"You dictate the pace at which the events unfold.

	"{@creature Shemshime|CM}'s control over a creature is broken by the break enchantment effect of a {@spell dispel evil and good} spell (magic that is probably beyond the characters' ability to cast) or by reducing the creature to 0 hit points. A {@condition charmed} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	"The key feature of {@i Shemshime's Bedtime Rhyme} is its music box, which broke centuries ago. Rather than playing the tune all the way through, it skips near the end and starts over. The same is true for the pop-up scene that plays out when the book is opened.": "{@i Shemshime's Bedtime Rhyme}的关键特征是它的音乐盒，几个世纪前就坏了。它不是一直在演奏曲子，而是在接近尾声时跳过，重新开始。当这本书被打开时，弹出的场景也是如此。",
	"The damage to the exterior of the box is immediately noticeable to characters who inspect it. A successful DC 15 Intelligence check reveals the problem. Anyone proficient with jeweler's tools or tinker's tools has advantage on the roll. Inside the music box is a brass cylinder dotted with tiny pegs. When the cylinder turns, narrow bits of metal pluck the pegs to produce the notes of the melody. The cylinder is sitting askew, which prevents it from working properly. Fixing the music box requires three successful DC 15 Dexterity checks, each check requiring an action. These checks can be made by one character or multiple characters working together.": "盒子外部的损坏对检查它的人来说是很明显的。一个成功的DC15智力检查可以发现问题。任何精通珠宝商工具或工匠工具的人都有优势。音乐盒里有一个黄铜圆柱体，上面点缀着小钉子。当圆筒转动时，狭窄的金属碎片拨动钉子，产生旋律的音符。圆筒是歪着坐的，这使它不能正常工作。修复音乐盒需要三次成功的DC15灵巧检查，每次检查都需要一个动作。这些检查可以由一个角色或多个角色共同完成。",
	"Characters who try to fix the music box hear {@creature Shemshime|CM}'s maddening whispers in their heads. After making an ability check to fix the music box, regardless of whether the check succeeds or not, a character must make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw, taking 14 ({@dice 4d6}) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "试图修复音乐盒的角色会在脑海中听到{@creature Shemshime|CM}令人抓狂的低语。在进行修复音乐盒的能力检查后，无论检查是否成功，角色都必须进行DC13智力救赎，救赎失败会受到14({@dice 4d6})的精神伤害，救赎成功则受到一半的伤害。",
	"The book trembles, and its mechanical inner workings squeal to a halt for a moment before whirring back to life. You hear clicks, and shadows burst forth from the book like steam from a kettle, collecting along the ceiling until wisps of darkness outline a vague humanoid figure. Meanwhile, the scenes inside the book transform, creating an entirely new picture that includes tiny cutout figures of yourselves.": "书在颤抖，它的机械内部运作在呼啸着恢复生机之前吱吱作响，停了一会儿。你听到咔嚓声，影子从书中迸发出来，就像水壶里的蒸汽，沿着天花板聚集，直到几缕黑暗勾勒出一个模糊的人形。与此同时，书中的场景发生了变化，创造出一幅全新的画面，其中包括你们自己的小剪影。",

	"Luring {@creature Shemshime|CM} to where it can be crushed takes some effort. Because {@creature Shemshime|CM} is fixated on the book, the spirit pursues whoever has it.

	"Once {@creature Shemshime|CM} is in position, a character can use an action to drop or topple a heavy object on it. {@creature Shemshime|CM} must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being crushed under the object. On a failed save, {@creature Shemshime|CM} vanishes and one of the following outcomes occurs:": "一旦{@creature Shemshime|CM}就位，角色可以使用一个动作，将一个重物掉落或倾倒在上面。{@creature Shemshime|CM}必须在DC15的灵巧救赎中成功，以避免被压在物体下。如果救赎失败，{@creature Shemshime|CM}就会消失，并出现以下结果之一。",
	"If the book is intact, {@creature Shemshime|CM} is yanked back into the book. It slams shut, silencing the music box and ending the curse.": "如果书是完整的，{@creature Shemshime|CM}就会被拽回书中。它被关上，使音乐盒安静下来，结束诅咒。",

In the center of the room, a brass railing surrounds an overlook that gives a view of the lower level of the stacks.": "圆形的房间里有弯曲的深色木质书架，上面挤满了各种形状、大小和年龄的书籍。书架顶上摆放着陶瓷盆中的鲜花，给这个区域带来了甜美的香味。房间周围的凹槽以一定的间隔排列。其中四个摆放着面容姣好的学者的青铜雕像，三个摆放着长满绒毛的椅子。在房间的中央，一个黄铜栏杆围绕着一个俯瞰台，可以看到书库的下层。",
	"Hanging from the ceiling, above the opening in the floor, is an enormous stone sculpture of an open book that looks as though the cover is flapping to keep it aloft. A spiral staircase to the east leads down, as well as up to the trapdoor exit set into the ceiling. The occasional errant firefly flits about.": "在地板上的开口上方，悬挂着一个巨大的石雕，是一本打开的书，看起来就像封面在拍打，以保持它的高耸。东边有一个螺旋形的楼梯通向下面，也通向设置在天花板上的活板门出口。偶尔会有失误的萤火虫飞来飞去。",
	"{@creature Varnyr|CM}'s restoration project began in this room, and it's tidier and more welcoming than the chamber below. She has brought in rugs and flowers and polished the statues. Three of the statues were in such a poor state that she replaced them with comfortable reading chairs.": "{@creature Varnyr|CM}的修复项目从这个房间开始，它比下面的房间更整洁、更温馨。她带来了地毯和鲜花，并擦亮了雕像。其中三座雕像的状态很差，她用舒适的阅读椅代替了它们。",

The box is currently raised, and the rope is tied to the railing.": "在栏杆上固定着一个绳索和滑轮装置，一端是一个磨损的篮子。几个世纪前，阿沃夫人把它放在这里，以便在楼层之间移动书籍。它本质上是一个大盖子的柳条篮子，可以降低或提高。它的状况不是最好的，所以它最多只能容纳50磅而不会散架。目前箱子被抬起来了，绳子被绑在栏杆上。",

	"The musty smell of old books hangs in the air here. Concentric rings of bookcases dominate the space, with a heavy granite table occupying the room's center.

Small stacks of books rest on the table along with a candleholder that contains firefly-filled jars.": "这里的空气中弥漫着旧书的霉味。同心环形的书柜占据了整个空间，一张沉重的花岗岩桌子占据了房间的中心。这张桌子本来是一个圆形，但在它的边缘有六个半圆形的空隙，为六把椅子创造了空间。桌子上放着小堆的书，还有一个烛台，里面放着装满萤火虫的瓶子。",

	"A nervous muttering precedes the approach of one of the Avowed, who scans the tomes on the surrounding shelves as they draw near to you. \"She must have been here... I don't understand...\" they murmur as they catch sight of you.": "一个 \"阿维德 \"的人在靠近你之前紧张地嘀咕着，当他们靠近你时，他扫描了周围书架上的书籍。\"她一定来过这里......我不明白...... \"他们一边喃喃自语，一边说。我不明白...... \"他们在看到你时喃喃自语。",
	"\"Ah. Forgive this disturbance,\" the acolyte says. \"But I'm looking for...\" They stop short as they catch sight of {@i The Price of Beauty}. \"Yes, I'm looking for that.\" Then, looking over your group, the acolyte appears saddened. \"But you haven't seen anyone else... well, you haven't seen Falthrax, have you?\"": "\"啊，请原谅我的打扰，\"圣徒说。\"但我在寻找......\" 当他们看到{@i The Price of Beauty}时，他们停了下来。\"是的，我在找那个。\" 然后，看了看你们这群人，圣徒显得很忧伤。\"但你没有看到其他人......嗯，你没有看到法尔赛克斯，是吗？\"",
	"The {@creature acolyte} is Lorris Niss, a middle-aged, neutral good half-elf searching for a missing friend. Falthrax Loderr is a shield dwarf acolyte whom Lorris last saw two days before. Lorris is clearly upset but maintains her composure as she shares the following information:": "这个{@creature acolyte}是Lorris Niss，一个寻找失踪朋友的中年、中立的好半精灵。Falthrax Loderr是一个盾牌矮人圣职者，Lorris最后一次见到他是在两天前。洛里斯显然很不高兴，但她在分享以下信息时保持了镇定。",
	"Falthrax is a dear friend who has been troubled of late by depression; he talked of feeling as though his life is passing him by.": "法尔赛是一位亲爱的朋友，他最近被抑郁症所困扰；他谈到感觉好像他的生命正在流逝。",
	"The dwarf's mood had improved in the last tenday after he discovered a book in the Candlekeep stacks—{@i The Price of Beauty}. Already a worshiper of Sune, god of beauty, Falthrax talked of how the book spoke to him, and how its advice on meditation and self-worth was helping him.": "这个矮人的心情在上个星期有所好转，因为他在烛光镇的书堆里发现了一本书--{@i The Price of Beauty}。法尔兹拉克斯已经是美神苏妮的崇拜者，他谈到了这本书是如何与他对话的，以及书中关于冥想和自我价值的建议是如何帮助他。",
	"The last time Lorris saw Falthrax, the dwarf was in a sad mood and said that he was going to spend time with the book. Falthrax didn't return to his quarters that night and hasn't been seen since. He was noticed entering the stacks where {@i The Price of Beauty} is kept, but no one saw him leave.": "洛里斯最后一次见到法尔兹拉克斯时，这个矮人心情很悲伤，说他要去花时间看书。法尔萨克斯当晚没有回到他的住处，此后再也没有人看到他。有人注意到他进入了存放{@i The Price of Beauty}的书堆，但没有人看到他离开。",
	"{@i The Price of Beauty} is bound in soft green leather, eight inches wide and fourteen inches tall, and set with golden clasps. The book gives off the unmistakable scent of lilies.

Delicate handwriting accompanies the illustrations, in the form of short prayers and meditations dedicated to seeking self-worth, techniques for massage and healing, and recipes for creating balms and cosmetics.": "这本书充满了美丽的林地场景、艺术和珠宝的插图。精致的笔迹伴随着插图，其形式是专门用于寻求自我价值的简短祈祷和冥想，按摩和治疗的技术，以及制作香膏和化妆品的配方。",
	"On the last page is an inscription by the author, Sylvarie Silversong, which reads: \"A mirror is a gateway to happiness, truth, and to accepting ourselves.\"": "在最后一页是作者西尔瓦利-西尔弗松的题词，内容如下。\"镜子是通往幸福、真理和接受自己的大门\"。",
	"When any creature holds {@i The Price of Beauty} and gazes into the mirror, the image of Sune replaces their own reflection and speaks in a soft voice, saying, \"Well met, dearest one. How do you feel today?\" (If the characters have not experienced this already, Lorris looks into the mirror while recounting what happened to Falthrax, and then drops the book in fright when it speaks to her.)": "当任何生物持有{@i The Price of Beauty}并注视着镜子时，苏妮的影像会取代他们自己的倒影，并以柔和的声音说话，说：\"你好啊，最亲爱的人。你今天感觉如何？\"（如果人物还没有经历过这种情况，洛里斯在叙述发生在法尔兹拉克斯身上的事情时看着镜子，然后在镜子对她说话时吓得把书丢了。）",
	"The mirror's unique illusion magic reacts and responds to the creature looking into it. Though it is not sentient and cannot answer complex questions, the mirror offers encouragement and advice on grooming and self-confidence. As it does so, the illusion shows the creature looking into the mirror, but changing and grooming its skin, hair, makeup, and clothing as desired. If the creature holding the book is happy with how it looks, or shows no interest in such matters, the illusion reverts to a normal mirror until used again.": "这面镜子独特的幻觉魔法会对看着它的生物做出反应和回应。虽然它没有知觉，也不能回答复杂的问题，但这面镜子提供了关于修饰和自信的鼓励和建议。当它这样做的时候，幻象显示生物在看着镜子，但根据需要改变和修饰它的皮肤、头发、化妆和衣服。如果拿着书的生物对自己的样子很满意，或者对这些事情不感兴趣，幻象就会恢复成普通的镜子，直到再次使用。",
	"If the creature holding the book mentions a desire to change something about itself, or that it feels unwell, tired, or unhappy, the illusion responds, \"If rest, relaxation, or transformation is what you need, then follow the lilies, dearest one. I am sure Sylvarie will see to your needs.\" The mirror then glows softly, and a 5-foot-wide, 7-foot-high portal appears in the nearest unoccupied space. The portal leads to an old woodland trail marked by posts that resemble sculpted stone lilies. As the characters will discover, the portal leads to a temple and bathhouse run by three elf sisters, where all is not as it seems.": "如果拿着书的生物提到想要改变自己的某些东西，或者感觉不舒服、疲倦或不快乐，幻象会回应说：\"如果休息、放松或转变是你需要的，那么就跟着百合花走吧，最亲爱的。我相信希尔瓦里会满足你的需要。\" 然后镜子发出柔和的光芒，一个5英尺宽、7英尺高的门户出现在最近的无人空间。这个传送门通向一条古老的林间小道，上面有类似于石雕百合花的柱子作为标记。正如角色们将发现的那样，这个传送门通向一个由三个精灵姐妹经营的寺庙和澡堂，在那里，一切都不像看上去那样。",
	"The portal remains active for 5 minutes, then vanishes. {@i The Price of Beauty} cannot be used to create another portal until the next dawn.": "传送门在5分钟内保持活跃，然后消失。{@i The Price of Beauty}在下一个黎明前不能用于创建另一个传送门。",
	"If the portal manifests while Lorris is present, the acolyte guesses correctly that it was the cause of Falthrax's disappearance. She fears the powerful magic involved and is apprehensive about what might have happened to her friend.": "如果传送门在洛里斯在场时显现，圣徒就会正确地猜测它是法尔赛克斯失踪的原因。她害怕所涉及的强大魔法，对她的朋友可能发生的事情感到忧虑。",
	"If the characters aren't inclined to investigate the portal or go after the missing acolyte, Lorris goes to one of the library's Great Readers to report Falthrax missing, and she mentions having met a group of adventurers in the library. The Great Reader then summons the characters and beseeches them to look into the matter.": "如果角色们不愿意调查传送门或去找失踪的圣徒，Lorris就去找图书馆的一个大阅读者报告Falthrax的失踪，她提到在图书馆里遇到了一群冒险家。然后，大阅读者召集了这些人物，恳请他们调查此事。",
	"This grand temple and bathhouse rests in a serene and ancient grove in the High Forest, southeast of Silverymoon. The temple was built over a century ago by the author of {@i The Price of Beauty}, Sylvarie Silversong, after visions bestowed by Sune led her to a hot spring infused with fey magic.": "这座宏伟的寺庙和澡堂坐落在银月城东南的高级森林里，是一片宁静而古老的小树林。这座寺庙是一个多世纪前由{@i The Price of Beauty}的作者希尔瓦里-西尔弗松(Sylvarie Silversong)建造的，因为苏妮赐予她的幻觉将她带到了一个充满了费伊族魔法的温泉。",
	"Ten years ago, a coven of green hags calling themselves the Fetid Gaze tricked Sylvarie into a bargain that allowed them to take over the bathhouse. These cruel and cunning fey now use the temple to lure wealthy, greedy, and vain nobles and adventurers, preying on their insecurities and tricking them into accepting dark bargains that ultimately lead to misery.": "十年前，一个自称是 \"恋恋不舍\"（Fetid Gaze）的绿衣女巫团欺骗了希尔瓦里，使他们得以接管澡堂。这些残忍而狡猾的妖怪现在利用神庙来引诱富有、贪婪、虚荣的贵族和冒险家，利用他们的不安全感，诱使他们接受最终导致痛苦的黑暗交易。",
	"The temple consists of three buildings. What was once Sylvarie's private tower has been taken over by the hags as a lair, and a former shrine to Sune has become a prison for the cursed elf. The main bathhouse looks exactly as Sylvarie built it, and it continues to provide services to visitors. Most of the staff of the bathhouse are the coven's wicked minions in disguise, but also here are an undercover Harper agent, a water spirit, and a cursed kobold—all potential allies who can reveal the coven's malicious machinations.": "这座寺庙由三座建筑组成。曾经是希尔瓦里的私人塔楼已经被女巫们占为巢穴，而以前苏妮的神龛已经成为被诅咒的精灵的监狱。主澡堂看起来和希尔瓦里建造的一模一样，而且它继续为游客提供服务。浴场的大部分工作人员都是女巫会伪装的邪恶爪牙，但这里也有一个卧底的哈珀特工、一个水鬼和一个被诅咒的科波德--他们都是可以揭穿女巫会的恶意阴谋的潜在盟友。",
	"Three {@creature Green Hag||green hags} named Dread Morgan, Vile Sazha, and Auntie Greenbones were once rivals who dwelled in an area of the Feywild coterminous with the High Forest. A decade ago, during a time when the boundaries between the planes thinned, the hags became aware of the magic spring controlled by Sylvarie—and decided to control and corrupt it for their own purposes. The covetous hags each knew part of a ritual for crafting magic paintings that could bind mortal creatures with a terrible curse. After agreeing to share their knowledge and work together, they formed a coven dedicated to claiming Sylvarie's temple and making it a base for their nefarious plans.": "三个{@creature Green Hag||green hags}名叫可怕的摩根、卑鄙的萨莎和绿骨阿姨的人曾经是对手，他们居住在与高等森林相邻的精灵世界的一个地区。十年前，在各个星球之间的边界变薄的时候，女巫们意识到了希尔瓦里控制的魔法泉，并决定为自己的目的控制和腐蚀它。觊觎的女巫们每个人都知道制作魔法画的部分仪式，可以用可怕的诅咒束缚凡人的生物。在同意分享他们的知识并一起工作后，他们组成了一个女巫团，致力于夺取希尔瓦里的神庙，并将其作为他们邪恶计划的基地。",
	"The hags use their powers of illusion to pose as three elf sisters named Morganna, Azirssa, and Greensong. They are typically found in the bathhouse by day and in their tower lair at night.

If the characters destroyed Sylvarie's painting before coming here, they encounter Sylvarie in her true form: a neutral good moon elf {@creature priest} who is not wearing armor (AC 10). In this case, she is weeping by the pool and grateful to be free of the hags' curse.": "改变希尔瓦莉的诅咒直到她在{@area area T18|247|x}的画像被摧毁才会结束。这幅画的毁坏还有一个额外的好处，那就是恢复了希尔瓦莉的中性善的排列方式，这时她会尽其所能地帮助党派摆脱寺庙中的邪恶生物。如果角色在来这里之前毁掉了希尔瓦莉的画，他们会遇到希尔瓦莉的真实形态：一个没有穿戴盔甲的中性善良的月精灵（1%）（AC为10）。在这种情况下，她正在水池边哭泣，并为摆脱女巫的诅咒而感激。",

The place looks and feels more like a refugee encampment than a trading post.": "贸易站的中心结构是一个坚固的石头和泥砖建筑，上面装饰着保存下来的巨蟹的甲壳和爪子，通常在这里进行贸易。它周围的地面通常没有建筑，现在有许多临时住所，商业活动已经放缓到了停滞状态。这个地方看起来和感觉上更像是一个难民营，而不是一个贸易站。",

Pond Mother saw no reason to refuse them, since their motives were seemingly innocent. But then, two tendays afterward, another group of yuan-ti came on the scene. These yuan-ti attacked the village, killed any frogfolk who tried to resist, and captured the grippli who weren't able to escape.": "她告诉大家，一小队元老在一个多月前来到这个地区，声称是一个仁慈的神灵的追随者，他们称之为鳞甲之母。他们很友好，与格里普利人遇到并与之交战的其他元蒂人相反。这些元老们表示有兴趣挖掘和恢复格里普利村的旧址，离现在的位置有一英里。塘主母亲认为没有理由拒绝他们，因为他们的动机似乎是无辜的。但是，两天后，又有一群元老来到了现场。这些元老们袭击了村子，杀死了所有试图反抗的蛙人，并抓走了没能逃脱的蛙人。",

Pond Mother fears that either they have been disposed of, or they have been imprisoned in the old temple that lies north of the village. In any event, saving the eggs, or as many of them as possible, is the grippli's main concern.": "她向人物求助，告诉他们元老们一直在吃他们的蛋，并折磨着留在村子里的几个格里普利人。自从更大的邪恶力量降临村子后，就再也没有听到友好的元宝们的消息了。塘主母亲担心，要么他们已经被处理掉了，要么他们已经被囚禁在村子北边的老庙里了。在任何情况下，拯救鸡蛋，或尽可能多的鸡蛋，是格里普利的主要关切。",
	"If the characters demand payment, Pond Mother can offer the modest contents of the trading post's coffers (200 gp) for clearing out the village and safeguarding the eggs. She points out that the characters are also entitled to keep any items of value that don't belong to the villagers.": "如果人物要求付款，池塘之母可以提供贸易站库房中的少量物品（200GP），用于清理村庄和保护鸡蛋。她指出，人物也有权保留不属于村民的任何有价值的物品。",
	"The trading post is about 5 miles south of the grippli village, which is most easily reached by sea. (An overland trip along the marshy coastline is a fool's route, fraught with obstacles and perils.) Mitor Jans will transport the characters as far as he can, then drop them off just outside the crab maze that borders the community before turning back south.": "贸易站在格里普利村以南约5英里处，从海上最容易到达。(沿着沼泽地海岸线的陆路旅行是一条愚蠢的路线，充满了障碍和危险）。Mitor Jans会尽可能地把人物送到最远的地方，然后在社区边界的螃蟹迷宫外把他们放下，再折回南方。",
	"Columns of stone with platforms built around them, connected by rickety-looking gangways that touch the sea or disappear beneath the frothing waves, are arrayed before you. In the distance you can see the marshy shore. Dark shapes move under the surface, and flashes of red carapace draw the eye. This is not a safe place.": "石柱周围建有平台，由看起来摇摇欲坠的舷梯连接，这些舷梯接触到海面或消失在汹涌的海浪之下，在你面前排列着。在远处，你可以看到沼泽地的海岸。黑暗的形状在海面下移动，闪烁的红色甲壳吸引着人们的目光。这不是一个安全的地方。",
	"Getting to the village is the characters' first challenge. Between the characters and the village is a network of cages where the grippli have kept, captured, and bred giant crabs for centuries.": "前往村庄是人物的第一个挑战。在人物和村庄之间有一个笼子网络，几个世纪以来，格里普利人在这里饲养、捕捉和繁殖巨蟹。",
	"The crab maze is a collection of low-to-the-water walkways, ranging in height from just above the water to being submerged by up to 2 feet. Each main walkway is wide enough for two Medium creatures to walk side by side, while the smaller branching ones are wide enough for only a single person. Interspersed through this web of rickety wood and netting are processing platforms built around the stone columns, each large enough to hold four creatures. Under the water, in open-topped cages made of netting, lurk a great number of giant crabs that haven't been fed recently. As the characters start to make their way to shore, the water begins to froth as the giant crabs become excited.": "蟹类迷宫是一系列低至水面的走道，高度从刚过水面到被淹没的2英尺不等。每条主走道的宽度足以让两个中型生物并排行走，而较小的分支走道的宽度只够一个人走。在这个由摇晃的木头和网子组成的网络中，穿插着围绕石柱建造的加工平台，每个平台都足以容纳四个生物。在水底，用网兜制成的敞口笼子里，潜伏着大量最近没有被喂养的巨蟹。当人物开始上岸时，由于巨蟹变得兴奋，水面开始泛起泡沫。",
	"No craft larger than a {@vehicle rowboat} can navigate the crab maze because the water is too shallow and already occupied by angry giant crabs. The characters are dropped off outside the maze at a point of your choosing. The water is only 4 or 5 feet deep throughout this area, but wading to shore is impossible since the crabs are everywhere. The characters' goal is to get to the breakwater that separates the maze from the village while avoiding the crabs as much as they can.": "任何大于{@vehicle rowboat}的船只都不能在螃蟹迷宫中航行，因为水太浅，而且已经被愤怒的巨蟹占据。角色们在迷宫外你选择的地点被放下。整个区域的水只有4或5英尺深，但涉水上岸是不可能的，因为螃蟹无处不在。人物的目标是到达分隔迷宫和村庄的防波堤，同时尽可能地避开螃蟹。",
	"The processing platforms, located wherever two walkways join or intersect, are safe havens. The platforms are high enough above the water that the crabs won't attack creatures atop one.": "加工平台，位于两条人行道连接或相交的地方，是安全的避风港。这些平台离水面足够高，螃蟹不会攻击平台上的生物。",
	"After negotiating the maze, the characters come upon a low wall that the grippli have constructed to keep sea creatures away from the village and to protect the lagoon on the other side from rough water when a storm is raging. This breakwater is made of intertwined branches reinforced by tough vines. Hinged on the sides and split in the middle, it can be opened to allow the passage of small boats. In the closed position, as it is now, the breakwater is not designed to prevent entry to the village by anyone who can simply climb up and over it.": "在穿过迷宫后，人物来到一堵低矮的墙前，这是格里普利人建造的，目的是为了防止海洋生物远离村庄，并在风暴肆虐时保护另一侧的泻湖不受波及。这个防波堤是由交织在一起的树枝制成的，用坚韧的藤蔓加固。它两边铰接，中间裂开，可以打开，让小船通过。在关闭的状态下，就像现在这样，防波堤的设计并不是为了阻止任何人进入村子，他们可以简单地爬上去并越过它。",
	"If the characters avoided any contact with the giant crabs, or if they have handled those threats with a minimum of commotion, they can easily move over and beyond the breakwater without alerting the yuan-ti in the village. By taking the shortest path to shore, the characters can make landfall just north of the docks.": "如果人物避免了与巨蟹的任何接触，或者如果他们以最小的骚动处理了这些威胁，他们就可以轻松地越过防波堤，而不会惊动村里的元老。通过采取最短的路径上岸，人物可以在码头的北面登陆。",
	"The yuan-ti, overconfident to a fault, are likely to fight to the death without trying to summon reinforcements. To give the characters a stiffer challenge, you can have a patrol of {@dice 1d4 + 2} {@creature Yuan-ti Pureblood||yuan-ti purebloods} arrive on the scene, attracted by the sounds of combat, before the original squad has been vanquished.": "元老们过于自信，很可能在没有召唤援军的情况下就拼死一搏。为了给这些角色一个更激烈的挑战，你可以让一支{@dice 1d4 + 2}{@creature Yuan-ti Pureblood||yuan-ti purebloods}的巡逻队在原来的小队被消灭之前，被战斗的声音所吸引，到达现场。",
	"The grippli village is set near the sea in a brackish marsh. Rising from the muck are circular, domed mud-brick buildings that the grippli use for homes and storage facilities. The carapaces and claws of giant crabs feature heavily in the architecture.": "格里普利人的村庄靠近大海，位于一个咸水沼泽中。淤泥中耸立着圆形、圆顶的泥砖建筑，格里普利人将其作为住宅和储存设施。巨蟹的甲壳和爪子在建筑中占有很大的比重。",
	"If the characters get to shore without causing a conflict with the yuan-ti, they can move freely (if carefully) around the village. (The evil serpentfolk are here for a particular purpose, and as a rule they have no quarrel with anyone who doesn't directly threaten their plan or try to impede what they're doing.)": "如果人物上岸后没有引起与元老们的冲突，他们就可以在村子里自由行动（如果小心的话）。(邪恶的蛇妖在这里有一个特殊的目的，作为一项规则，他们与任何没有直接威胁到他们的计划或试图阻碍他们工作的人都没有争执）。",
	"The ground throughout this area is damp and soft at best. Staying dry is difficult to impossible.": "这个地区的地面充其量是潮湿和柔软的。保持干燥是困难的，甚至是不可能的。",
	"The dozen or so {@creature Grippli Warrior|CM|grippli warriors} (see {@area the end of the adventure|273|x} for their stat block) remaining in the village are there only to do the yuan-ti's bidding; they all show signs of abuse from their treatment. Some are in a state of mourning, after being forced to watch the yuan-ti consume their eggs.": "留在村子里的十几个{@creature Grippli Warrior|CM|grippli warriors}（见{@area the end of the adventure|273|x}的状态块）只是为了听从元天的命令；他们都有被虐待的迹象。有些人在被迫看着元帝吃掉他们的蛋后，陷入了悲痛之中。",
	"Unlike the materials used for the crab maze, the docks are sturdy planks of wood tightly fastened together and treated to make the structure waterproof.": "与螃蟹迷宫所用的材料不同，这些码头是坚固的木板，紧紧地固定在一起，并经过处理，使结构防水。",
	"Only a couple of small boats remain tied up at these piers, the others having been used by the grippli who retreated to the trading post.": "只有几条小船仍然拴在这些码头上，其他的小船已经被撤退到贸易站的格里普利人使用。",
	"The yuan-ti have no interest in the small boats that are moored here—meaning that if they remain undamaged, the characters could use them for transport when they decide to leave this place behind.": "元老们对停泊在这里的小船没有兴趣--这意味着如果它们没有被损坏，当他们决定离开这个地方时，人物可以用它们来运输。",
	"The religious center of the village, this enormous building made of wood and mud bricks has been turned into a prison where the evil yuan-ti are holding some of the followers of the Scaled Mother. The hemispherical building, 20 feet high and 50 feet in diameter, is by far the largest structure in the community.": "作为村里的宗教中心，这座由木头和泥砖建成的巨大建筑已经变成了一座监狱，邪恶的元老们在这里关押了一些鳞甲母亲的信徒。这个半球形的建筑，高20英尺，直径50英尺，是迄今为止社区中最大的建筑。",
	"The guards remain at their stations until they hear significant sounds of activity coming from the ground level, or until a character ascends one of the staircases and comes into their view, whereupon they all rush to attack. The prisoners, even if they're left unattended, won't leave their cells willingly while combat is going on.": "狱警们一直呆在自己的岗位上，直到他们听到来自地面的重要活动声音，或者直到一个人物登上某个楼梯并进入他们的视野，这时他们都会冲上去攻击。囚犯即使无人看管，也不会在战斗进行时自愿离开他们的牢房。",
	"If the characters dispose of the guards and free the prisoners, the benevolent yuan-ti explain what they know of the situation: they are allies of the grippli who have been victimized by the evil yuan-ti that invaded the village recently. They know from their captors that two of their number have been hauled through the marsh northward to the location of a temple in the old village, where they are to be sacrificed to the evil deity Sseth sometime soon.": "如果角色们解决了守卫并释放了囚犯，仁慈的元老们会解释他们所知道的情况：他们是格里普利人的盟友，最近被入侵村庄的邪恶元老们所害。他们从俘虏那里知道，他们中的两个人被拖着穿过沼泽，向北走到老村子里的一个寺庙的位置，在那里他们很快就会被献给邪恶的神灵Sseth。",
	"Near the outskirts of the village is the grippli nursery. In five places, built up like the sides of a well, stand 3-foot-high mud-brick walls enclosing 20-foot-diameter circular areas. These repositories, filled with clean, fresh water, are where the grippli lay their eggs and nurture offspring as they mature.": "靠近村子的郊区是格里普利苗圃。在五个地方，像井的两侧一样，矗立着3英尺高的泥砖墙，包围着直径20英尺的圆形区域。这些贮藏室充满了干净的淡水，是格里普利人产卵和培育后代的地方。",
	"All six yuan-ti are languishing on the ground between the pools and don't react until at least one of them becomes aware of the characters. If one of the malisons remains alive after 3 rounds of combat, it pours a vial of poison into the water of one pool, which kills all the eggs in it. On each succeeding round, if the characters don't prevent it, the same creature moves to poison a different pool until it is vanquished or until all the eggs have perished.": "所有六个元宝都在水池之间的地面上慵懒地躺着，直到至少有一个元宝意识到人物的存在才会有反应。如果其中一个恶鬼在3轮战斗后仍然活着，它就会向一个池子的水里倒入一小瓶毒药，从而杀死池子里的所有卵。在接下来的每一轮中，如果角色们没有阻止它，同一个生物就会移动到另一个池子里投毒，直到它被消灭或者所有的蛋都死掉为止。",
	"The simple domes of the grippli's residences and storage buildings are spread haphazardly around the marsh. Mud-brick with wicker roofs, they're modest affairs, primitively decorated with giant crab claws. Most are empty and show signs of abandonment.": "格里普利人的住宅和仓库的简单穹顶杂乱无章地分布在沼泽周围。泥砖和柳条屋顶，它们是简朴的事务，用巨大的蟹爪进行原始的装饰。大多数是空的，有被遗弃的迹象。",
	"Most of the village is made up of homes and storage facilities. The community is all but vacant at the present time, so there's nothing the characters can learn by examining any of the buildings.": "村庄的大部分是由住宅和仓储设施组成的。目前，这个社区几乎是空置的，所以通过检查任何建筑物，人物都无法了解。",
	"Under normal circumstances, groups of bonded grippli live in each home, which consists of a single medium to large room, lit with simple fish oil lamps. Grippli don't sleep in the water, but in soft hammocks suspended over it. Their personal effects are secured to the walls above the water in netting. Furniture is of simple but well-crafted wood, or adapted driftwood. Some homes have ceramic and glass jars (obtained through barter) and bronze pots and pans (likewise), used on occasions when the grippli want to cook something before eating it.": "在正常情况下，成群结队的格里普利人生活在每个家庭中，这些家庭由一个大中型房间组成，用简单的鱼油灯照明。格里普利人不睡在水中，而是睡在悬挂在水面上的柔软吊床上。他们的个人物品用网兜固定在水面上的墙上。家具是简单但制作精良的木材，或经过改造的浮木。一些家庭有陶瓷和玻璃罐子（通过易货贸易获得）和青铜锅碗瓢盆（同样），当格里普利人想在吃东西之前做饭时使用。",
	"Storage huts sit on stilts that keep their thatch floors from getting wet and thus protect the materials stored there from deterioration. Wood and other marsh vegetation used in construction are left here to dry out.": "储藏室坐落在高跷上，使其茅草地板不被弄湿，从而保护储存在那里的材料不被损坏。建筑中使用的木材和其他沼泽植物被放在这里晾晒。",
	"Following the river leads the characters northeast through the Cloakwood. The characters should realize that this is the route to the grippli's old village, which they have heard about from Pond Mother and perhaps also from the yuan-ti captives.": "沿着河边走，人物向东北方向走，穿过斗篷林。角色们应该意识到这是通往格里普利老村的路线，他们从池塘之母那里听说过这个村子，也许也从元蒂俘虏那里听说过。",
	"The old village was abandoned when the grippli realized they would fare better being closer to the water. They relocated to where the village now stands. The only structure left in the old village is the temple—now the site of activity once again.": "当格里普利人意识到他们在靠近水的地方会有更好的发展时，老村就被抛弃了。他们搬到了现在村子的位置。老村子里唯一留下的建筑是寺庙--现在又成了活动的场所。",
	"Before the evil yuan-ti arrived, the followers of the Scaled Mother had begun to excavate the temple ruins, hoping to find evidence of their benevolent deity. The work is continuing under the rule of the evil serpentfolk, but it's slow going. Several grippli have been forced to continue digging the place out, while their masters stay inside the part that has already been opened up. It's here that preparations are being made for the sacrifice of the yuan-ti's prisoners.": "在邪恶的元帝到来之前，鳞甲之母的追随者已经开始挖掘寺庙遗址，希望能找到他们仁慈的神灵的证据。在邪恶的蛇妖的统治下，这项工作正在继续，但进展缓慢。几个格里普利人被迫继续挖掘这个地方，而他们的主人则留在已经被打开的部分里面。正是在这里，正在为牺牲元帝的囚犯做准备。",
	"When the characters approach the temple, they won't be able to escape the notice of the grippli prisoners. But the frogfolk know enough to remain silent in the face of potential rescue, and they use hand signals to direct the characters toward the courtyard. From there, the characters can approach the upper court ({@area area T2|26c|x}), where the prisoners are.": "当人物接近寺庙时，他们将无法逃脱格里普利囚犯的注意。但蛙人知道，面对潜在的救援，他们足以保持沉默，他们用手势指引人物走向院子。在那里，人物可以接近上院（{@area area T2|26c|x}），即囚犯所在的地方。",
	"The following locations are keyed to the map of the temple.": "以下地点是以寺庙的地图为关键。",
	"At the top of a short set of steps lies an open area enclosed by a ten-foot-high outer wall and paved with tightly fitted stone slabs. To either side are truncated ramps that lead down to a lower area, still blocked with earth and rubble that needs to be cleared away. Ahead of you, some fifty feet away, is another short staircase that leads to a ten-foot-high inner wall with a door-sized opening in it that's covered by a curtain. Coming from beyond the doorway inside the enclosed area, you can hear the groaning and plaintive cries of creatures being mistreated.": "在一个短小的台阶的顶端，是一个由十英尺高的外墙围起来的空地，上面铺着严丝合缝的石板。两边是截断的坡道，通向较低的区域，仍然被需要清理的泥土和瓦砾堵住。在你前面，大约五十英尺远，是另一个短的楼梯，通向一个十英尺高的内墙，墙上有一个门大小的开口，被帘子遮住。从封闭区域内的门洞外传来，你可以听到生物被虐待的呻吟和凄厉的叫声。",
	"The temple's courtyard can serve as a staging area for the characters, whose presence will not be noticed by the yuan-ti as long as they remain here. Any grippli in the courtyard when the characters arrive will make a hasty but silent retreat to places of safety outside the temple.": "寺庙的院子可以作为人物的集结地，只要他们留在这里，元老们就不会注意到他们的存在。当人物到达时，院子里的任何格里普利都会匆忙但无声地撤退到寺庙外的安全地点。",
	"The upper court of the temple has been completely cleared of debris. Six pillars support the ten-foot-high ceiling, and the northern half of the enclosed area is bathed in bright light, making it easy for you to see the horrific scene playing out in the far end of the room.": "寺庙的上院已经被完全清除了碎片。六根柱子支撑着十英尺高的天花板，封闭区域的北半部沐浴在明亮的光线下，使你很容易看到房间远端上演的恐怖场景。",
	"Even after the evil yuan-ti notice the characters, their first priority is to complete the ritual, which opens the lid of the sarcophagus and kills the prisoners. With fast action and accurate attacks, the characters can interrupt the ritual and prevent further harm to the victims. The abomination must use two of its turns to finish performing the ritual, which climaxes with one more sounding of the chime as the lid is thrown open. If the abomination takes any damage before completing the ritual, it stops what it's doing and turns its attention to the interlopers and attacks them, ordering the malisons to join the fight.": "即使在邪恶的元帝注意到这些人物后，他们的首要任务是完成仪式，打开石棺的盖子，杀死囚犯。通过快速的行动和准确的攻击，人物可以打断仪式，防止受害者受到进一步伤害。憎恶必须用它的两个回合来完成仪式，当石棺的盖子被推开时，钟声再次响起，将仪式推向高潮。如果憎恶在完成仪式之前受到任何伤害，它就会停止它正在做的事情，并把注意力转移到干扰者身上，攻击他们，命令恶灵们加入战斗。",
	"The objects used by the malisons are a {@item chime of opening} and a {@item lantern of revealing} (which they use as a precaution against {@condition invisible} enemies). After the malison strikes the chime for the first time, the item has 5 uses left. The lantern has 2 hours of fuel remaining.": "马利森使用的物品是一个{@item chime of opening}和一个{@item lantern of revealing}(他们用它来预防{@condition invisible}的敌人)。在马利森第一次敲响钟声后，该物品还剩5次使用。灯笼还有2小时的燃料。",
	"Assuming the characters interrupted the ritual, the lid of the sarcophagus is only slightly open, and the chime must be struck once more to open the lid fully. Inside the sarcophagus are two items of great significance to the yuan-ti: a suit of {@item serpent scale armor|CM} and a {@item serpent's fang|CM} (both described below).": "假设这些人物中断了仪式，石棺的盖子只是稍微打开，必须再敲一次钟才能完全打开盖子。石棺内有两件对元帝意义重大的物品：一套{@item serpent scale armor|CM}和一套{@item serpent's fang|CM}的衣服（都在下面介绍）。",
	"This suit of magic armor is made from shimmering scales. While wearing it, you can apply your full Dexterity modifier (instead of a maximum of +2) when determining your Armor Class. In addition, this armor does not impose disadvantage on your Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks.": "这套魔法盔甲是由闪闪发光的鳞片制成。穿着它时，你可以在确定你的护甲等级时应用你全部的灵巧修正值（而不是最大的+2）。此外，这件盔甲不会对你的灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查造成不利。",
	"When the abomination and its malison minions fall, the captured yuan-ti are overcome with joy. They tell the characters that they hail from a land to the south called Chult. They were called into service by the deity they know as the Scaled Mother and followed her portents as they traveled north. They began excavating the old temple, with the grippli's consent, in the expectation of finding relics left behind by the yuan-ti that raided through this area in ages past. They were unable to open the lid of the sarcophagus once they unearthed it and were in the process of clearing rubble from the courtyard stairs when the evil yuan-ti descended on the village and captured all the followers of the Scaled Mother.": "当憎恶和它的马利森爪牙倒下时，被俘虏的元老们都高兴得不得了。他们告诉这些人物，他们来自南方一个叫Chult的地方。他们被称为 \"鳞甲之母 \"的神灵召唤，跟随她的预兆向北行进。在格里普利的同意下，他们开始挖掘古老的寺庙，希望能找到过去在这一地区袭击的元老们留下的遗物。他们一出土就无法打开石棺的盖子，正在清理院子里楼梯上的碎石时，邪恶的元帝降临到村子里，抓走了所有鳞甲母亲的信徒。",
	"With the threat to the area neutralized, it doesn't take long for things to return to normal. When the grippli prisoners realize that the characters have persevered, they waste no time getting the news to the village and the trading post. The refugees return home, and within a tenday the frogfolk have repaired any damage to the crab pens and are back in business.": "随着该地区的威胁被解除，事情很快就恢复了正常。当格里普利囚犯意识到这些人物已经坚持了下来，他们毫不犹豫地将消息传给了村子和贸易站。难民们回家了，在一个星期内，蛙人已经修复了对蟹栏的损坏，并重新开始营业。",
	"The benevolent yuan-ti, once they recover from their wounds, might decide to continue digging out the temple or to return to their homeland, as you see fit. If the excavation goes on, you can populate the lower level of the temple with treasures or traps at your discretion.": "仁慈的元老们一旦从伤痛中恢复过来，可能会决定继续挖掘寺庙，或者返回他们的故乡，就看你的意思了。如果继续挖掘，你可以酌情在寺庙的下层填充宝物或陷阱。",
	"If the characters journeyed by land and went directly to the temple after spending little or no time in the village, the now-freed grippli prisoners explain that other evil yuan-ti are stationed in the village, and they too need to be dispensed with before the grippli can reclaim their homes.": "如果人物从陆路出发，在村子里花了很少或没有花时间就直接去了寺庙，那么现在获得自由的格里普利囚犯就会解释说，村子里还有其他邪恶的元老驻扎，在格里普利人收回家园之前，他们也需要被打发掉。",
	"Having done what they came to do, the characters are free to take their leave of the grippli anytime; once regular traffic resumes between the trading post and Candlekeep, the heroes have no trouble finding a ship that will carry them back to the library.": "做完了他们要做的事，人物可以随时离开格里普利；一旦贸易站和烛台镇之间的交通恢复正常，英雄们不难找到一艘能载他们返回图书馆的船。",
	"In the meantime, if the characters prevented one or more eggs in the brood pools from being killed, the returning grippli are so ecstatic that Pond Mother offers to perform a ceremony for the party's benefit, called the ritual of friend marking. If they agree, they are brought to the pool in the center of Pond Mother's home at midnight. The grippli, croaking sonorously, surround the characters while they stand in the warm water and Pond Mother pours the contents of a jar into the pool. The liquid swirls, and motes of light begin rising up around the characters. Any party members who have second thoughts at this point can avoid the effect by succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Party members who don't resist, or who fail their saves, fall into a trance until dawn—when they come to their senses, completely rested and healed. All party members who completed the ritual can speak and understand the Grippli language from now on.": "同时，如果人物阻止了育儿池中的一个或多个蛋被杀死，返回的格里普利就会欣喜若狂，池塘之母就会提出为当事人举行一个仪式，称为朋友标记仪式。如果他们同意，他们就会在午夜被带到池塘母亲家中心的水池。当他们站在温暖的水中时，池塘妈妈把罐子里的东西倒进池子里，格里普利呱呱地叫着，围绕着这些人物。液体旋转起来，人物周围开始升起光斑。任何在这个时候有其他想法的党员都可以通过DC15智慧救赎成功来避免这个效果。没有抵抗的党员或拯救失败的党员会陷入恍惚状态，直到黎明--那时他们会清醒过来，完全休息并痊愈。所有完成仪式的成员从现在开始可以说并理解格里普利语。",
	"At first glance or from a distance, a grippli looks like a large frog. Its head and body are indeed those of a frog, but its front extremities end in hands with fingers that enable it to manipulate weapons and other objects, and its rear legs have similar digits that it can use for grasping and climbing. A grippli can move as quickly on all fours as it can on two legs.": "乍一看或从远处看，格里普利看起来像一只大青蛙。它的头和身体确实是青蛙的，但它的前肢末端是带有手指的手，使它能够操纵武器和其他物体，它的后腿也有类似的手指，可以用来抓取和攀爬。格里普利人用四肢移动的速度和用两条腿移动的速度一样快。",
	"Grippli rely on ambushes and guerrilla warfare to defend themselves and their settlements. They can snare foes with their tongues to make them easier targets. Grippli villages are generally built from mud bricks and other natural materials harvested from the immediate vicinity.": "格里普利人依靠伏击和游击战来保卫自己和他们的定居点。他们可以用舌头钩住敌人，使他们更容易成为目标。格里普利人的村庄一般由泥砖和其他从附近收获的天然材料建成。",
	"Young grippli are raised by the community rather than by a single set of parents, and all of a community's eggs are kept in freshwater pools until they mature. Protecting their eggs is a major concern for grippli, since lizardfolk, yuan-ti, and other creatures are known to have a taste for them.": "小灰鼠由社区抚养，而不是由一对父母抚养，一个社区的所有鸡蛋都保存在淡水池中，直到它们成熟。保护它们的蛋是格里普利的主要关注点，因为蜥蜴人、元宝和其他生物都对它们有兴趣。",
	"Most grippli care more about survival than they do about abstract ideals such as good and evil. Grippli religion is based in animism and nature spirits; the frogfolk do not pay reverence to a single deity, but they might beseech a particular nature spirit for aid from time to time.": "大多数格里普利人更关心生存，而不是抽象的理想，如善与恶。格里普利人的宗教是基于万物有灵论和自然之灵；蛙人并不崇尚单一的神灵，但他们可能会不时地祈求某个自然之灵的帮助。",
	"In this adventure, the characters are caught up in an unsolved mass killing in the city of Waterdeep—after the ghost of one of the victims seeks them out.": "在这次冒险中，角色们被卷入了沃特迪普市的一场未解决的大屠杀中--在其中一个受害者的鬼魂找到他们之后。",
	"{@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor} came to Candlekeep five years ago, courtesy of a Waterdavian apprentice mage named Sirok, who bought the book at a street sale. It was part of a collection once owned by the renowned Yellowcrest family of Waterdeep. As he presented the book as payment for entry into Candlekeep, Sirok told the Avowed priests a grim story of how the patriarch of the family, Lord Yellowcrest, had returned to Waterdeep from a business trip to find his wife, their three children, and the house's four servants all murdered. In the aftermath of this terrible loss, the grieving lord sold all his possessions, then moved away from the city to live out his life in solitude.": "{@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor}五年前来到烛龙镇，由一位名叫西洛克的瓦特达维亚法师学徒提供，他在一次街头拍卖会上买下这本书。这本书是水底世界著名的黄冠家族曾经拥有的收藏品的一部分。当他把这本书作为进入烛台镇的报酬时，西罗克告诉了神甫们一个残酷的故事：家族的族长，黄冠勋爵，从一次商务旅行中回到沃特德，发现他的妻子，他们的三个孩子，以及家里的四个仆人都被谋杀了。在这一可怕的损失之后，这位悲伤的领主卖掉了他所有的财产，然后搬离城市，在孤独中度过他的一生。",
	"Sirok never got around to reading the book, and his story about the Yellowcrests was something he learned from gossiping acquaintances. The dark pedigree of Sirok's donation was soon forgotten, and {@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor} was cataloged and placed into the library's archives, where it has gone unnoticed ever since.": "西罗克从未读过这本书，他关于黄冠的故事是他从八卦的熟人那里得知的。西罗克捐赠的黑暗血统很快就被遗忘了，{@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor}被编入图书馆的档案中，从此无人问津。",
	"The adventure begins when the ghost of a young woman named Sarah appears before the characters as they peruse the stacks of Candlekeep. The reason that Sarah's ghost is able to manifest for the first time to the characters, after five years of silence, is left to your judgment. The spirit of the murdered woman might be drawn to a character who is dedicated to law or good, one whose background features a similar tragedy, or one who struggled to rise from poverty as she did. Alternatively, if one of the characters has a penchant for reading books from Candlekeep's shelves at random, you might have Sarah appear because her story is being read for the first time since her diary came to the library.": "冒险开始时，一个名叫莎拉的年轻女子的鬼魂出现在人物面前，因为他们正在浏览烛台的书堆。莎拉的鬼魂在沉寂了五年之后第一次出现在人物面前，其原因由你来判断。这个被谋杀的女人的灵魂可能会被一个致力于法律或正义的人物所吸引，一个背景具有类似悲剧的人物，或者一个像她一样从贫困中挣扎出来的人。另外，如果其中一个角色有随机阅读烛光之城书架上书籍的癖好，你可以让莎拉出现，因为自从她的日记来到图书馆之后，她的故事第一次被阅读。",
	"{@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor} is a nondescript general text, so it fits best in some forgotten corner of the library where tomes of no particular interest are stored. Read or paraphrase the following when you're ready to begin the adventure:": "{@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor}是一篇不伦不类的一般文字，所以它最适合放在图书馆的某个被遗忘的角落，那里存放着一些没有特别意义的书籍。当你准备开始冒险时，请阅读或转述以下内容。",
	"The air around you grows suddenly chilly. A cloud of vapor begins to shimmer along the nearby shelves, growing thicker around a nondescript leather-bound book. The mist suddenly coalesces into the vague form of a young woman—a translucent spirit wearing a servant's uniform and bearing the symbol of a tree outlined by a rising sun at her shoulder.": "你周围的空气突然变得寒冷起来。一团水汽开始沿着附近的书架闪烁，在一本不伦不类的皮装书周围越来越浓。雾气突然凝聚成一个年轻女人的模糊形态--一个穿着仆人制服的半透明的灵魂，肩上有一个由旭日勾勒的树的标志。",
	"The figure weeps aloud, tears running down her cheeks. She opens her mouth as if to speak—which reveals that her tongue is gone. Moaning in anguish, she reaches toward you. Then the mist shreds away to nothing, and the spirit fades.": "这个人物大声哭泣，泪水顺着她的脸颊流下。她张开嘴，似乎要说话--这表明她的舌头已经消失。她痛苦地呻吟着，向你伸手。然后，雾气被撕碎，化为乌有，灵魂消逝。",
	"{@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor} is a leather-bound book with brass corner fittings and an intricately carved brass clasp that holds the book shut. Embossing on the cover depicts the same symbol seen on Sarah's uniform—a lemon tree with the rising sun behind it. A character who has the {@background Noble||noble background}, who has an extensive knowledge of Waterdeep, or who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill History}) check recognizes this as the seal of the Yellowcrest family.": "{@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor}是一本装订成册的皮书，有黄铜角配件和一个精雕细琢的铜扣，将书关上。封面上的浮雕描绘了莎拉制服上的相同符号--柠檬树，后面是初升的太阳。拥有{@background Noble||noble background}的人物，对Waterdeep有广泛的了解，或者在DC14智力({@skill History})检查中成功地认出这是Yellowcrest家族的印章。",
	"The book's title appears handwritten on the first page, and it is clear that all of its pages were once blank. Only a handful of pages at the end of the book remain so. The rest are filled with handwriting that starts out crude but slowly becomes more elegant, hinting that it was produced by a person learning to write, who then practiced their writing by keeping a diary.": "这本书的标题出现在第一页上，很明显，它的所有页面曾经是空白的。只有书末的少数几页仍是如此。其余的都是笔迹，开始时很粗糙，但慢慢地变得更优雅，暗示它是由一个学习写作的人写的，然后通过写日记来练习写作。",
	"The pages of {@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor} are a mixture of exercises, drawings, and reminiscences. The earliest pages bear nothing but repetitions of the name \"Sarah.\" Lists of household chores, pending activities, shopping lists, and names take up a full third of the book.": "{@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor}的书页是练习、绘画和回忆的混合物。最早的几页除了重复 \"Sarah \"这个名字外没有其他内容。家务、待办事项、购物清单和名字的清单占了整本书的三分之一。",
	"Where the diary begins, the book becomes a firsthand account (written in Common) of the life of Sarah, who describes herself as a servant in the Waterdeep manor of Lord Viallis Yellowcrest and Lady Maria Yellowcrest. The diary entries are not on consecutive pages, and most are undated. In addition to writing about her daily obligations and life in the manor, Sarah also wrote about Lady Maria, who came from a poor family and empathized with Sarah's own lack of education. Lady Maria's genuine affection for Sarah led her to teach the young servant to write, and to give her the leather-bound book that became the diary.": "在日记开始的地方，这本书变成了莎拉生活的第一手资料（用普通话书写），她描述自己是维阿里斯-黄冠勋爵和玛丽亚-黄冠夫人的沃特德普庄园的仆人。日记中的条目并不在连续的页面上，而且大多数都没有日期。除了写她的日常义务和庄园里的生活外，莎拉还写了关于玛丽亚夫人的故事，她来自一个贫穷的家庭，对莎拉自己缺乏教育感同身受。玛丽亚夫人对莎拉的真挚感情使她教这个年轻的仆人写作，并送给她那本成为日记的皮装书。",
	"The last entries of the diary, dated just over five years earlier, change in tone as Sarah worries about the strange conduct of Lord Yellowcrest, and his habit of spending too much time with ancient books in his study. The final diary entry reads:": "日记的最后几条，日期是五年多以前，语气发生了变化，莎拉担心黄克雷斯特勋爵的奇怪行为，以及他在书房里花太多时间接触古书的习惯。最后一篇日记是这样写的",
	"I stole close to Lord Viallis today, and saw that he had chalked a circle marked with strange runes across the floor of his study. A puddle spread within the circle and appeared to me as bubbling blood. Lord Viallis stood next to it motionless, one of his vile books in hand, and muttered something I could not hear. I slipped away quickly, though I fear he might have heard me this time. I have never been so scared, but I must tell Lady Maria what I have seen. I must!": "我今天偷溜到维阿里斯大人身边，看到他在书房的地板上用粉笔画了一个标有奇怪符文的圈。一个水坑在圈内蔓延，在我看来是冒泡的血。维阿利斯勋爵一动不动地站在旁边，手里拿着他的一本卑鄙的书，嘴里嘟囔着什么，我听不见。我迅速地溜走了，尽管我担心他这次可能会听到我。我从来没有这么害怕过，但我必须告诉玛丽亚女士我所看到的一切。我一定要!",
	"Sarah also attempted to sketch what she remembered of the rune-marked circle. Any character who has proficiency in the {@skill Arcana} skill and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check recognizes the circle as part of a ritual casting of the {@spell contact other plane} spell, and can intuit that the runes Sarah has hastily copied are tied to an entity from the Outer Planes. Characters who do not recognize the circle can seek assistance from one of the Avowed to determine this information.": "莎拉还试图勾勒出她所记得的那个符文标记的圆圈。任何精通{@skill Arcana}技能并成功通过DC15智力({@skill Arcana})检查的角色都能认出这个圆圈是{@spell contact other plane}法术仪式的一部分，并能凭直觉判断出莎拉匆忙复制的符文与外星的一个实体有关。不认识这个圆圈的角色可以向一位神通者寻求帮助来确定这一信息。",
	"A thorough reading of the diary reveals the broad details of the lives of Sarah and the Yellowcrest family. Alternatively, if the characters call Sarah back (see below) and are able to communicate with her, you can allow the poor servant's spirit to reveal some of this information:": "彻底阅读日记可以发现莎拉和Yellowcrest家族生活的大致细节。另外，如果人物把莎拉叫回来（见下文）并能与她交流，你可以让这个可怜的仆人的灵魂透露一些信息。",
	"Yellowcrest Manor stands on Delzorin Street in Waterdeep's North Ward.": "Yellowcrest庄园位于沃特德普北区的德尔佐林街。",

	"Sarah was one of the servants killed alongside Lady Maria and the three Yellowcrest children—all murdered by Lord Viallis as part of his willing descent into evil.

Ever grieving, the spirit has had no way to communicate with the mortal realm—until the presence of the characters draws her forth.": "萨拉是与玛丽亚夫人和三个Yellowcrest孩子一起被杀的仆人之一--都是被Viallis勋爵谋杀的，是他自愿堕入邪恶的一部分。五年来，这位年轻女子的不朽之魂一直被束缚在{@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor}之内。她一直很悲痛，没有办法与凡人界沟通，直到这些人物的出现将她吸引过来。",
	"Sarah understands characters who speak Common and tries to respond to them, but she can't speak because Lord Viallis cut out her tongue before killing her. The ghost tries to communicate through moaning whispers and by pointing the characters to the parts of her diary that hint at Lord Viallis's evil.": "莎拉能听懂说普通话的人物，并试图回应他们，但她不能说话，因为维阿里斯勋爵在杀死她之前割掉了她的舌头。鬼魂试图通过呻吟的低语和向人物指出她日记中暗示Viallis勋爵邪恶的部分来交流。",

	"Five years ago, Lord Viallis murdered his family, Sarah, and three other servants as part of a ritual to contact an otherworldly entity.

	"To get the characters into the mystery as quickly as possible, their trip to Waterdeep unfolds with no problems or random encounters, unless you determine otherwise.

	"The village of Greenfast is located a day's travel southeast of Waterdeep. Characters can easily obtain directions to the small farming settlement, which lies a short distance off the Trade Way, along a broad creek flowing into the Dessarin River. Greenfast is a prosperous community whose farmers take advantage of their proximity to the Trade Way to sell to both Waterdeep and Daggerford.": "格林法斯特村位于沃特德普东南方向一天的路程。角色们可以很容易地获得前往这个小农庄的路线，它位于贸易之路的不远处，沿着一条流入德萨林河的宽阔小溪。格林法斯特是一个繁荣的社区，这里的农民利用靠近贸易大道的优势，向沃特迪普和达格福特销售产品。",
	"Lord Viallis is well known in the village, though any people the characters talk to describe the retired noble as a quiet person who keeps to himself. All the villagers know about the tragedy of five years before. They also know that when Viallis moved to Greenfast, he announced his plans to rebuild an old tower an hour away as a private estate. Not much has happened at the site as far as the villagers are aware, though construction and renovations are slowly ongoing, and Viallis is known to have a number of workers living at the tower. (Viallis's talk of rebuilding the abandoned tower is a cover for his sinister activities, as the characters will discover.)": "Viallis勋爵在村子里很有名，尽管与之交谈的人都说这位退休的贵族是个沉默寡言的人，不爱说话。所有的村民都知道五年前的那场悲剧。他们还知道，当Viallis搬到Greenfast时，他宣布他计划在一小时外重建一座旧塔作为私人庄园。据村民们所知，在这个地方并没有发生什么事情，虽然建筑和装修正在缓慢进行，而且据说Viallis有一些工人住在塔里。(Viallis所说的重建废弃的塔是为了掩盖他的阴险活动，角色们会发现这一点。)",
	"Viallis lives in a comfortable house (see {@area area G3|29e|x}), but he is not home when the characters arrive.

	"Kara knows that Viallis is creating some sort of following, having attracted many admirers who now live in and around the village. She doesn't know the full extent of his activities, nor does she have any idea that he and his secret cult are responsible for the increasing number of travelers disappearing along the Trade Way.": "卡拉知道维阿里斯正在创造某种追随者，已经吸引了许多崇拜者，他们现在住在村子里和周围。她不知道他活动的全部范围，也不知道他和他的秘密邪教要对越来越多的旅行者在贸易之路上消失负责。",
	"Two months ago, Kara's sister, Yaeda, fell under Viallis's sway and went to what Kara calls the noble's \"new estate\" (the cult's temple). She believes that Yaeda is working for or romantically involved with Viallis, not knowing that he holds her prisoner. Kara has never been to the estate and has no idea of the extent of Viallis's activities there, but she can give the characters directions if they share what they suspect about Viallis and promise to bring Yaeda back.": "两个月前，卡拉的妹妹Yaeda受Viallis的影响，去了卡拉所说的贵族的 \"新庄园\"（邪教的寺庙）。她认为Yaeda在为Viallis工作或与他有恋人关系，不知道他把她囚禁起来。卡拉从来没有去过那个庄园，也不知道Viallis在那里的活动范围，但她可以给这些人物指点迷津，只要他们说出他们对Viallis的怀疑并保证把Yaeda带回来。",
	"Old Fargo has long distrusted Lord Viallis, instinctively seeing him as a bad sort, but he keeps his thoughts to himself unless the characters engage him in conversation. With appropriate roleplaying or a successful DC 13 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, he describes Viallis as a collector of sycophants who uses wealth to try to impress people. His son, Young Fargo, fell into Viallis's circle of influence a month ago, and Old Fargo hasn't seen him since. He knows that Viallis and his followers are said to be building an estate away from the village, and he can give the characters directions there.": "老Fargo长期以来一直不信任Viallis勋爵，本能地认为他是个坏人，但他对自己的想法保持沉默，除非人物与他交谈。通过适当的角色扮演或成功的DC13魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查，他将Viallis描述为一个收集佞人的人，用财富来试图讨好别人。他的儿子，小法戈，一个月前落入了Viallis的势力范围，而老法戈从那时起就没有见过他。他知道维阿里斯和他的追随者据说正在远离村庄的地方建造一座庄园，他可以给这些人物指路。",
	"If the characters share their suspicions about Viallis being involved in the Yellowcrest murders or other dark business (especially if they have learned of the cult after a fight at the barn at {@area area G5|2a0|x}), Old Fargo becomes distraught and begs them to rescue his son from Viallis's grasp.": "如果人物分享他们对Viallis参与Yellowcrest谋杀案或其他黑暗事务的怀疑（特别是如果他们是在{@area area G5|2a0|x}的谷仓打斗后得知邪教的，老法戈就会变得心烦意乱，求他们把他的儿子从Viallis的手中救出来。",

The place is filled with business records and correspondence, all of which concern Lord Viallis's business and none of which appear suspicious or out of the ordinary.": "维阿利斯的监督员的住所是一间舒适的小屋，其主要房间兼作办公室。这里摆满了商业记录和信件，所有这些都与Viallis勋爵的生意有关，没有一个看起来可疑或不正常的。",
	"If the characters came to Greenfast without meeting {@creature Faerl|CM} in Waterdeep, you can have them find the overseer at home if you see fit. Use the details in the \"{@area Yellowcrest Businesses|287|x}\" section and the information on {@creature Faerl|CM} there to shape the conversation. If the characters threaten him or ask questions that indicate they know more about the cult than {@creature Faerl|CM} likes, the overseer makes a point of opening a window \"to get some air.\" This is a signal to the cultists at the barn (area G5) to come running.": "如果人物没有在Waterdeep遇到{@creature Faerl|CM}就来到了Greenfast，如果你认为合适，你可以让他们在家里找到监督者。利用\"{@area Yellowcrest Businesses|287|x} \"部分的细节和那里的{@creature Faerl|CM}的信息来塑造对话。如果这些人物威胁他或问一些问题，表明他们对邪教的了解比{@creature Faerl|CM}喜欢的要多，监督者就会主动打开窗户，\"去透透气\"。这是向谷仓（G5区）的邪教人员发出的信号，让他们跑过来。",
	"Two {@creature Cult Fanatic||cult fanatics} and two {@creature Veteran||veterans}—neutral evil humans loyal to Viallis—work here by day. They keep an eye out for trouble and keep their ears open for word of nondescript travelers passing through the area. When Viallis needs new sacrifices, the cultists snatch victims along the Trade Way at night. (If at least one day passes between the characters meeting Vecken and arriving in Greenfast, the cultists' most recent expedition ended with the capture of the vengeful warrior. See {@area area B11|2ce|x}.)": "两个{@creature Cult Fanatic||cult fanatics}和两个{@creature Veteran||veterans}--忠于维阿里斯的中立邪恶人类，白天在这里工作。他们时刻注意着麻烦，并留心听着经过该地区的不知名的旅行者的消息。当维阿里斯需要新的祭品时，邪教徒们会在晚上沿着贸易路抢夺受害者。(如果从人物见到维肯到到达格林法斯特至少有一天的时间，那么邪教组织最近的一次远征就以抓获这位复仇的战士而告终。参见{@area area B11|2ce|x}。",
	"Use the guidelines in the \"{@area Street Fight|28e|x}\" section earlier to run the encounter if the cultists and the characters face off. Unlike the mercenaries in Waterdeep, these villains know a great deal of information that they share if they are defeated and threatened:": "如果邪教徒和角色对峙，请使用前面\"{@area Street Fight|28e|x} \"一节中的指南来进行遭遇战。与水底世界的雇佣兵不同，这些恶棍知道大量的信息，如果他们被打败并受到威胁，就会分享这些信息。",

	"Lord Viallis took over an old ruin outside the village, wanting to turn it into an estate. The work at the site is a ruse for opening up and rebuilding a series of subterranean chambers, which now constitute the cult's temple. With the temple completed, Lord Viallis has ordered the cult's activities to be stepped up.": "维阿里斯勋爵接管了村外的一个古老废墟，想把它变成一个庄园。该地的工作是为了打开并重建一系列地下房间的诡计，这些房间现在构成了邪教的神庙。随着神庙的建成，维阿里斯勋爵已下令加强邪教的活动。",
	"The cultists know nothing of the whereabouts of the remains of Lady Maria and her children. Lord Viallis never speaks of his life before the cult.": "邪教分子对玛丽亚夫人和她孩子的遗体的下落一无所知。维阿里斯勋爵从不谈及他在邪教之前的生活。",
	"An hour out of Greenfast stands an old stone tower, long abandoned and crumbling. When Lord Viallis came to Greenfast after murdering his family, {@creature Faerl|CM} showed him the tower, thinking that Viallis might consider it a suitable site for a summer home. But Viallis, already well involved in his plans to make contact with the Great Old One called Gaernoo, saw even more potential for the site.": "离开格林法斯特一个小时后，矗立着一座古老的石塔，长期被遗弃，摇摇欲坠。当Viallis勋爵在谋杀了他的家人后来到Greenfast时，{@creature Faerl|CM}向他展示了这座塔，认为Viallis可能会考虑将其作为一个合适的避暑胜地。但Viallis已经充分参与了他与伟大的老者Gaernoo接触的计划，他看到了这个地方的更大潜力。",
	"For five years, Viallis has led and nurtured a cult to Gaernoo, whose members have been working to reclaim the ruined tower site, creating a temple within the subterranean levels below. Though the cult remains small in numbers, it has grand ambitions.": "五年来，Viallis领导并培养了一个对Gaernoo的崇拜，其成员一直在努力开垦废塔遗址，在下面的地下楼层创建一个神庙。虽然邪教的人数仍然很少，但它有宏伟的野心。",
	"When the characters approach the tower site, read the following:": "当人物接近塔址时，阅读以下内容。",
	"Amid a grove of gnarled scrub trees stands a half-fallen stone tower. Rough workers' tents, piles of timbers, and tools scattered about show that the site appears to be under reconstruction, though little headway seems to have been made in restoring the tower to its former glory.": "在一片参天的灌木丛中，矗立着一座半倒塌的石塔。粗糙的工人帐篷、成堆的木材和散落的工具表明，这个地方似乎正在重建，尽管在恢复塔楼以前的荣耀方面似乎没有取得什么进展。",
	"As the characters draw closer, it becomes clear that the signs of construction are largely spurious. The timbers that might have been used to shore up and help rebuild the tower walls are years old and beginning to rot. The tools are rusted. The tents show signs of recent occupation (cultists who don't live in the village bunk here, near the temple) but contain no personal effects.": "随着人物的走近，很明显，建筑的迹象基本上是虚假的。可能被用来加固和帮助重建塔墙的木材已经使用多年，并开始腐烂。工具都生锈了。帐篷有最近被占领的迹象（不住在村子里的邪教徒在这里下铺，靠近神庙），但没有个人物品。",

The cultists, overconfident after years of having their operations ignored, have set no guards protecting access to what lies below.": "搜索现场的人物可以看到，在塔内，一个石阶通向黑暗。在多年来他们的行动被忽视后，邪教分子过于自信，没有设置任何警卫来保护进入下面的东西。",

Another door stands along the west wall, and the wall opposite that appears to have collapsed, revealing a rough passageway beyond.": "楼梯下降了30英尺，然后通向一个由加工过的石头组成的房间。入口两侧有两个火炉，燃烧着非自然的海蓝色的光。柱子站成两排，每根柱子上都雕刻着其他世界的生物的面孔。一个喷泉在房间的远端静静地流淌，在一扇双门前。另一扇门沿西墙而立，对面的墙似乎已经倒塌，露出了外面的一条粗糙的通道。",
	"The fountain holds crystal-clear water and has a silver cup sitting on its edge. A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals an aura of divination magic in the water, one sip of which bestows the effect of the {@spell guidance} cantrip.

Water taken from the fountain loses its magic after 10 minutes.": "这座喷泉盛着晶莹剔透的水，边上放着一个银杯。一个{@spell detect magic}的咒语揭示了水中的占卜魔法光环，喝一口就能获得{@spell guidance}的咒语效果。获得这种好处的生物在下一个黎明前不能再这样做。从喷泉中抽取的水在10分钟后会失去魔力。",

	"These two cells—one to the north and one to the south—are closed off by locked iron-bar doors. Lord Viallis carries the keys that unlock the doors. As an action, a character can try to pick a door's lock using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.": "这两间牢房--一间在北边，一间在南边--被上了锁的铁栅栏门所封闭。维阿利斯勋爵带着能打开门的钥匙。作为一个行动，一个角色可以尝试用盗贼的工具撬开门锁，只要成功通过DC15的灵巧检查就可以了。",

	"If Vecken got to Greenfast ahead of the characters, he is also one of the prisoners. The warrior tells the characters that their news inspired him to seek his own vengeance for Sarah, but he was captured when he took on a squad of cultists looking for victims along the Trade Way. Vecken has been reduced to 25 hit points. Though injured, he is healthy enough to escort the other prisoners to safety if the characters have more of the temple to explore.": "如果维肯比这些人物先到格林法斯特，那么他也是囚犯之一。这个战士告诉角色们，他们的消息激励他为莎拉寻求自己的复仇，但他在对付一队在贸易路上寻找受害者的邪教徒时被俘。维肯的命中率已降至25点。虽然受了伤，但他还算健康，如果角色们有更多的神庙可以探索，他可以护送其他囚犯到安全地带。",
	"One of the recruits bears a noticeable resemblance to Old Fargo and is his son, Young Fargo. He fights as furiously as the other cultists but loses his zeal if the characters subdue him.

	"If the zealous cult leader died in his showdown with the characters, the cult is no more. Because Viallis shared none of his magical knowledge with his followers, any cultists who might have escaped have no connection to Gaernoo or the entity's power.": "如果狂热的邪教领袖在与人物的对决中死亡，那么这个邪教就不复存在。因为维阿里斯没有把他的魔法知识分享给他的追随者，任何可能逃脱的邪教成员都与盖尔努或实体的力量没有任何联系。",

	"If Vecken is present, he weeps upon seeing Sarah again, then thanks the characters for what they've done after all the spirits have passed on. Vecken might remain a lifelong friend to the characters, and his own exploits could provide inspiration for future adventures.": "如果Vecken在场，他在再次见到Sarah时就会哭泣，然后在所有的灵魂都去世后感谢人物所做的一切。维肯可能会成为角色们的终生朋友，他自己的经历可以为未来的冒险提供灵感。",
	"{@i Lore of Lurue} is the work of Ecamane Truesilver, the first High Mage of Silverymoon, at the behest of the lesser deity Lurue the Unicorn. It was later added to Ecamane's personal library, where it collected dust long after Ecamane's death in 712 DR. Eventually, the book made its way into the hands of a young and eager traveling monk, Ulraunt. He thought that the book would be an appropriate offering for his entrance into Candlekeep, and right he was. After being accepted, the book was stored in the library's archives.

	"In actuality, {@i Lore of Lurue} is an enchanted storybook—one that, if read, could bestow upon its reader gifts and blessings.

What is causing this disruption, and what is its purpose?": "实际上，{@i Lore of Lurue}是一本被施了魔法的故事书--如果读了它，可以给读者带来礼物和祝福。当人物打开书的那一刻，他们就被带到了森林中心的一个半空中。在那里，他们被安排去调查森林中出现的瘟疫。他们必须找到这种腐败的根源，并将其从世界上清除。是什么造成了这种破坏，其目的是什么？",

	"Thought by many to be the daughter of Selûne, god of the moon, Lurue the Unicorn is a lesser deity with strong ties to Mielikki, god of the forest. Mielikki oversaw the forest in the early days of creation, but once her work was done, she needed a guardian to represent her and be her eyes and ears on the Material Plane. Selûne agreed with Mielikki's assessment and offered Lurue for the role. Lurue took on the mantle of Mistress of Moonlight with pride, diligently working for the coexistence of humans, elves, and other talking beasts within the forest's expanse.": "许多人认为独角兽露露是月神塞鲁恩的女儿，她是一个较小的神，与森林之神米利基关系密切。米利基在创世初期监督着森林，但一旦她的工作完成，她就需要一个监护人来代表她，成为她在物质世界的眼睛和耳朵。塞鲁尼同意米利基的评估，并提出由卢鲁伊担任这一角色。露露自豪地接过了月光女主人的衣钵，勤奋地工作，为人类、精灵和其他会说话的野兽在森林的广阔范围内共存。",

	"The story takes the characters generally northward through several noteworthy locations, each one equivalent to a major section in the book. No map is necessary for the adventurers to get from one place to the next; if they try to deviate from the direction the story takes them, the same barrier of force prevents them from making any progress.": "故事带着人物大致向北穿过几个值得注意的地方，每个地方都相当于书中的一个主要章节。冒险者从一个地方到下一个地方不需要地图；如果他们试图偏离故事带他们的方向，同样的力量屏障会阻止他们取得任何进展。",

	"Four injured {@creature Wolf||wolves} come upon the party but keep their distance. Each has {@dice 1d8} hit points remaining.

	"When the characters have learned all they can from Wheeldoli, the sprite directs them to a narrow gravel path that skirts the community and then continues northward through the underbrush.": "当人物从Wheeldoli那里了解到所有情况后，精灵将他们引向一条狭窄的砾石路，绕过社区，然后继续向北穿过灌木丛。",
	"\"Hurry along now,\" he says. \"Danger along the way might impede your travel, so there's no time to waste!\"": "\"现在赶紧走，\"他说。\"沿途的危险可能会阻碍你的旅行，所以没有时间可以浪费！\"",
	"Four cowardly {@creature Ettercap||ettercaps} are lurking nearby, waiting for their webs to snag some prey. At the sound of intruders, they scurry into the underbrush and {@action hide}, staying 30 feet away from the webbed path, loosely spread out. The ettercaps are ambush hunters and run from a prolonged fight.": "四个胆小的{@creature Ettercap||ettercaps}潜伏在附近，等待着他们的网来攫取一些猎物。一听到入侵者的声音，它们就窜入灌木丛中，{@action hide}，在离网路30英尺远的地方，松散地散开。埃特卡普是伏击猎手，从长时间的战斗中跑出来。",
	"The characters' path takes them into a densely forested area. By following a break in the trees that sends them north and west, they come upon a sign that this area is inhabited:": "角色们的道路将他们带入一个森林茂密的地区。他们沿着树木的断裂处向北和向西走，发现了一个标志，表明这个地区有人居住。",
	"Gnarled bushes and dead or diseased trees surround a run-down wooden shack. A wisp of smoke rises from a rotted-out hole in the roof that is lined with fungus. South of the shack is a low stone wall that forms the perimeter of a large hole, while east of the building is a larger wooden structure covered with creeping vines.": "虬曲的灌木和死亡或生病的树木围绕着一个破旧的木屋。一缕烟雾从屋顶上一个腐烂的洞里升起，洞里有真菌。棚屋的南面是一堵低矮的石墙，形成了一个大洞的周边，而建筑的东面是一个更大的木制结构，上面覆盖着爬行的藤条。",
	"As you come a bit closer, the sound of voices suddenly emerges from the shack. One occupant cackles wickedly, and two other voices emit muffled whimpers and groans.": "当你走得更近一些时，棚屋里突然传出了声音。一个居住者邪恶地咯咯笑着，另外两个声音发出低沉的呜咽和呻吟声。",
	"The following locations are keyed to the map of the hag's hovel.": "以下地点是以老巫婆的小屋的地图为关键。",
	"The characters might correctly assume that this place is what it looks like: the site of a well (which is now abandoned). If they approach to within 5 feet of the stone wall, they can peer over the 2-foot-high wall into the hole, which is dark, but they don't get an idea of how deep the hole is or what's in it.": "人物可能会正确地认为这个地方就是它的样子：一口井的遗址（现在已经废弃了）。如果他们靠近石墙5英尺以内，他们可以越过2英尺高的墙，看到洞口，里面一片漆黑，但他们不知道这个洞有多深，也不知道里面有什么。",
	"The only way into the shack is through the door on the east side. When a character first peers into the room, read:": "进入棚屋的唯一途径是通过东侧的门。当一个角色第一次窥视这个房间时，请阅读。",
	"The inside of the shack is in a terrible state of disrepair. The only contents of note are a ramshackle bed, a scratched-up table, a warped wooden shelf with several containers on it, and a fireplace with wooden spoons and ladles hanging from hooks above it. To your left, two figures are bound and gagged on the floor while a blue-skinned hag looms over them. The captives appear to be dryads.": "棚屋的内部年久失修，非常糟糕。唯一值得注意的东西是一张破烂不堪的床，一张被划伤的桌子，一个扭曲的木头架子，上面放着几个容器，还有一个壁炉，上面的钩子上挂着木勺子和水瓢。在你的左边，有两个人被捆绑着塞在地板上，而一个蓝皮肤的巫婆在他们面前晃悠。这些俘虏似乎是干尸。",
	"The night hag is focused on tormenting her captives and can be taken by surprise if the characters succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) group check. Lanedrie begins by using her claws and spells to teach the interlopers a lesson, but if the characters don't dispose of her promptly, she does not hesitate to cut her losses and uses a {@spell plane shift} spell to leave their company.": "这个夜魔女专注于折磨她的俘虏，如果角色在DC15的灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）群体检查中成功，就能出其不意。兰尼德里开始用她的爪子和法术来教训这些闯入者，但如果角色们没有及时处理掉她，她会毫不犹豫地减少损失，用一个{@spell plane shift}法术离开他们的公司。",
	"Tucked in a clearing is a ramshackle structure 15 feet wide and three times as long. If the characters rescued Trekaila and Argentia in area H2 before coming here, the dryads follow closely behind the characters, eager to find their missing dryad companion, Hanah. A door on the west end of the building opens easily, revealing the following:": "在一片空地上有一个宽15英尺、长3倍的破烂建筑。如果角色在来这里之前在H2区救出了Trekaila和Argentia，那么干尸就会紧跟在角色身后，急于寻找他们失踪的干尸同伴Hanah。建筑物西端的一扇门很容易打开，露出下面的东西。",
	"The moment the door is opened, you are met with a cacophony of wild sounds. Clawing and gnashing at the cages that confine them, animals of all sorts screech and holler in every which way, some growling with pent-up aggression, others wincing in pain.": "当门被打开的那一刻，你看到的是一片嘈杂的野性声音。各种各样的动物在笼子里乱抓乱咬，发出尖锐的叫声，有的在咆哮，有的在痛苦地哀嚎。",
	"Eighteen cages, most of them occupied, line the walls of this grotesque menagerie.": "在这个怪诞的动物园里，墙上挂着18个笼子，其中大部分都有人。",

	"This {@condition unconscious} {@creature dryad} is Hanah. If Trekaila and Argentia are present, they try to rush to Hanah's side and minister to her. Hanah has been reduced to 0 hit points from the hag's rough treatment, but she is stable. If the characters don't administer healing of their own, one of the other dryads casts a {@spell goodberry} spell and force-feeds the berries to Hanah. If she regains even 1 hit point, Hanah becomes conscious.": "这个{@condition unconscious}{@creature dryad}是哈拿。如果特雷凯拉和阿根提亚在场，他们会试着冲到哈娜的身边，为她传道。哈娜在老巫婆的粗暴对待下，命中率降至0，但她很稳定。如果角色们没有自己进行治疗，其他干尸之一会施放一个{@spell goodberry}的法术，将浆果强行喂给哈娜。如果她恢复了哪怕是1点生命值，哈娜就会有意识。",
	"After she gets her bearings, Hanah says she's able to travel. She wants nothing more than to leave this place. Trekaila and Argentia, of course, are in complete agreement. The dryads part company with the characters, heading back toward Polvarth Plateau after wishing the adventurers success in whatever they are trying to do.": "在她确定了方向之后，哈娜说她能够旅行了。她最想做的就是离开这个地方。当然，特雷凯拉和阿根提亚也完全同意。干尸们在祝愿冒险者们成功地完成他们的任务后，就和这些人物分道扬镳，朝波尔瓦特高原走去。",
	"At last, it seems as though you have reached the northern edge of the forest. The trees are fewer and farther between, and a short distance ahead you can see the edge of a body of water. As you come closer, you see it's a wide river running perpendicular to your path. Off to the east, the river runs between two swaths of dense forest. To the west is a well-worn trail that leads through the underbrush and seems to follow the watercourse. On the ground in front of you are the remains of campfires, suggesting that others have used this area as a place to rest.": "最后，你似乎已经到达了森林的北部边缘。树木越来越少，间隔越来越远，在前面不远处，你可以看到一个水体的边缘。当你走近时，你看到它是一条与你的道路垂直的宽阔河流。在东边，河流在两片茂密的森林之间流淌。西边是一条磨得很好的小路，穿过灌木丛，似乎是沿着水道走的。在你前面的地面上有篝火的遗迹，表明其他人曾把这个地区作为休息的地方。",
	"This stop is what it seems: an opportunity for the party to rest before their next confrontation. The characters can finish a long rest (if they choose to do so) without incident. The river water is good to drink, and if the characters have the means, they can fish for their supper.": "这一站就像它看起来的那样：在下一次对抗之前，给党派一个休息的机会。人物可以顺利完成长时间的休息（如果他们选择这样做）。河里的水很好喝，如果人物有办法的话，他们可以钓鱼来吃晚饭。",
	"When the characters are ready to move on, they quickly discover that the story is compelling them to follow the trail heading west. (Turning back is not an option.)": "当人物准备继续前进时，他们很快发现，这个故事正迫使他们沿着小路向西走。(回头是不可能的）。",
	"In the prologue of {@i Lore of Lurue}—not a part of the story that the characters witness or experience—Ecamane Truesilver describes the underlying truth of the situation and identifies the entity responsible for the upheaval of the demiplane.": "在{@i Lore of Lurue}的序言中--不是故事中人物见证或经历的部分--卡曼-特鲁西尔弗描述了情况的基本真相，并指出了对半位面的动荡负责的实体。",
	"The evil creatures waiting to confront the characters at the end of their journey are the bloodthirsty minions of Malar, god of the hunt, also known as the Beast Lord. Malar's goal is to assume dominance over the forest—particularly the area around the Pool of Eternal Spring—and his agents have been hard at work brutally killing animals of all sorts in tribute to their god, then casting the carcasses into the pool.": "等待人物在旅程结束时面对的邪恶生物是猎神马拉尔的嗜血爪牙，他也被称为野兽之王。马拉尔的目标是统治森林--特别是永恒之泉池周围的地区--他的代理人一直在努力工作，残忍地杀害各种动物以向他们的神致敬，然后把尸体扔进池子里。",
	"As the adventurers will discover, this cult of Malar (otherwise nameless) includes several crazed berserkers as well as worgs and werewolves. When the characters arrive on the scene, the cultists' depredations have corrupted the water of the pool, setting the stage for Malar's final act in his campaign of terror.": "冒险家们会发现，这个马拉尔的邪教组织（否则无名）包括几个疯狂的狂暴者以及虫族和狼人。当人物到达现场时，邪教分子的掠夺行为已经腐蚀了池水，为马拉尔在恐怖活动中的最后行动创造了条件。",
	"Malar believes that there is no better way to demonstrate his dominance than by using his cult members to help bring forth a corrupted version of the avatar of Lurue the Unicorn to serve the Beast Lord's ends in his newly claimed domain. It is this effort that the characters must foil if they are to see their role in the story of {@i Lore of Lurue} end happily.": "马拉尔认为，没有比利用他的邪教成员帮助独角兽鲁鲁的堕落化身在他的新领地为兽王服务更好的方式来证明他的统治地位。如果他们想看到自己在{@i Lore of Lurue}故事中的角色愉快地结束，就必须挫败这种努力。",
	"No matter when the characters set out after their rest, the passage of time on the demiplane speeds up or slows down to ensure that night has fallen by the time they reach the next encounter location:": "无论人物在休息后何时出发，半位面的时间流逝都会加快或减慢，以确保在他们到达下一个遭遇地点时夜幕已经降临。",
	"Following the river course enabled you to make good progress for a while by skirting the forest. Now, as the sun dips below the horizon, the river makes a sharp turn to the north away from the trees. From the opposite direction comes a rumble of thunder and a flash of red lightning, vivid against the darkening sky.": "沿着河道，你可以绕过森林，取得一段时间的良好进展。现在，当太阳降到地平线以下时，河流向北急转，远离了树木。从相反的方向传来隆隆的雷声和一道红色的闪电，在渐渐暗淡的天空中显得格外生动。",
	"The thunder and lightning should make it apparent which direction the characters are meant to take. The last leg of their journey takes them south along a wide trail through the forest. After a few minutes of careful travel, they get evidence that they're not alone: from somewhere nearby ahead, they hear gruff voices growling and roaring. It's easy for the characters to sneak toward the sounds for a closer look. The following boxed text corresponds to the campsite shown on the right-hand side of the Pool of Eternal Spring map:": "雷声和闪电应该让人明白人物要走的方向。旅程的最后一段，他们沿着森林中一条宽阔的小路往南走。经过几分钟的小心翼翼的旅行，他们得到了他们并不孤单的证据：从前面的某个地方，他们听到了粗暴的声音在咆哮和怒吼。角色们很容易向声音的方向潜行，以便仔细观察。以下方框内的文字与永生泉池地图右侧的营地相对应。",
	"Six huts circle the perimeter of a clearing. In the center of the open area, a large bonfire burns. Targets made of bones and stuffed animals, as well as dummies made of hides and furs, complete the encampment.": "六座小屋围绕着一片空地的周边。在空地的中央，燃烧着一团大篝火。用骨头和毛绒动物制成的靶子，以及用皮毛制成的假人，使营地更加完整。",
	"A group of vicious-looking warriors are gathered around the fire. They clink together their bone mugs and rip into raw animal flesh with their teeth. Fresh blood drips from their mouths and hands. It seems like a celebration of some sort. Occasionally, between the warriors' cruel laughs, you can hear a cry of \"To the Beast Lord!\"": "一群面目凶恶的战士围着火堆。他们把自己的骨杯碰在一起，用牙齿撕咬生的动物肉。新鲜的血液从他们的嘴里和手上滴落下来。这似乎是某种庆祝活动。偶尔，在战士们残酷的笑声中，你可以听到 \"为兽王干杯！\"的呼喊。",
	"Eight {@creature Berserker||berserkers} of the cult are consuming a pile of animals they have killed as a way of paying tribute to Malar. If they aren't tearing at the meat, they are playing with the dead bodies, kicking them to and fro. Two {@creature Worg||worgs} chained to nearby posts snarl and growl anytime a dead carcass gets close enough.": "八个(%0)的邪教徒正在食用他们杀死的一堆动物，作为向马拉尔致敬的一种方式。如果他们没有撕咬肉，他们就在玩弄尸体，把它们踢来踢去。两个被拴在附近柱子上的{@creature Worg||worgs}，只要有死尸靠近，就会发出咆哮声。",
	"This noisy revelry provides each character with advantage on any Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check to get closer to the cult members. If the characters linger too long before acting, one of the worgs picks up their scent and, with a roar, alerts the berserkers to the characters' presence. The berserkers fight to the death until one remains. That warrior tries to retreat to the south, hoping to alert the cult members gathered at the pool (see below).": "这种嘈杂的狂欢为每个角色提供了在任何灵巧({@skill Stealth})检查上的优势，以接近邪教成员。如果角色在行动前逗留太久，其中一只虫子就会闻到他们的气味，并发出一声怒吼，提醒狂暴战士们注意角色的存在。狂暴战士们拼死抵抗，直到剩下一个人。那个战士试图向南撤退，希望能惊动聚集在水池边的邪教成员（见下文）。",
	"After the characters deal with the cultists at the campsite, the way forward is obvious: lightning flashes in the sky every few minutes, seeming to be centered over a place that's within a couple minutes' walk to the south.": "在人物处理完营地里的邪教分子后，前进的道路是显而易见的：天空中每隔几分钟就会有闪电闪过，似乎是以一个地方为中心，向南走几分钟就到了。",
	"In the far distance, the sky is clear, but directly above the pool is a black storm cloud spitting bolts of red lightning. When the characters arrive, standing at the edge of the pool are six wolf-like humanoids, their backs to the characters. With faces raised up in supplication, they chant ominously. Read:": "在远处，天空是晴朗的，但在水池的正上方是一片黑色的风暴云，喷出红色的闪电。当人物到达时，站在池边的是六个狼形人，他们背对着人物。他们抬起脸来祈求，不祥地念叨着。阅读。",
	"You have come upon the Pool of Eternal Spring, or at least what's left of it: its once clear waters are now streaked with red and black impurities. Standing at the edge of the pool is a feral-looking human clad in animal skins. This individual leads five werewolves in chanting \"Water into blood, earth into bones!\"": "你来到了永生之泉池，或者至少是它的遗迹：它曾经清澈的水现在布满了红色和黑色的杂质。站在池边的是一个身着兽皮的野性人类。这个人带领五个狼人高呼 \"水变血，土变骨！\"",
	"In less troubling times, the Pool of Eternal Spring was a little slice of Mount Celestia on earth. Its crystal-clear waters nourished the nearby lands and fostered the most abundant plant and animal life imaginable. The usual pleasant fragrance that wafts from the pool is now replaced by the scent of metal and blood.": "在不那么麻烦的时候，永生泉池是地球上的一小片天山。它晶莹剔透的水滋润着附近的土地，孕育着可以想象到的最丰富的植物和动物生命。从池子里飘出的通常令人愉快的香味现在被金属和血的气味所取代。",
	"The cult of Malar has prepared the pool in anticipation of the winter solstice. By filling the Pool of Eternal Spring with offerings to Malar—creatures of the forest that have been brutally killed and slain, then tossed into the water—the cult has tainted it as a gesture of reverence to their deity. Unbeknownst to them, the arrival of the solstice triggers the final phase of Malar's plan.": "马拉尔邪教为迎接冬至而准备了这个水池。通过在永恒之泉池中填入献给马拉尔的祭品--那些被残忍杀害的森林生物，然后被扔进水里，邪教组织玷污了它，以示对其神灵的敬畏。他们不知道的是，至日的到来触发了马拉尔计划的最后阶段。",
	"If any creature drinks the corrupted water from the pool, it must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains a randomly determined form of short-term madness (see \"{@book Madness|DMG|8|Madness}\" in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}).": "如果任何生物喝了池子里的腐化水，它必须做一个DC15的魅力拯救动作。拯救失败后，该生物会获得一种随机决定的短期疯狂状态（见\"{@book Madness|DMG|8|Madness} \"中的{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}）。",
	"In normal circumstances, the avatar of Lurue is a breathtaking sight; her silver, stardust-like mane, her shimmering hooves, and her perfectly formed spiral horn elicit awe from even the most hardened souls. As powerful and striking as she is in her true form, she's just as wicked in her alternative state. With necrotic energy twisting and dancing at the tip of her black horn, this corrupted avatar of Lurue is instead a nightmare come to life.": "在正常情况下，鲁鲁的化身是一个令人惊叹的景象；她那银色的、像星尘一样的鬃毛，她那闪闪发光的蹄子，以及她那完美的螺旋角，甚至引起了最顽固的灵魂的敬畏。与她的真实形态一样强大和引人注目，她在另一种状态下也同样邪恶。随着坏死的能量在她黑色的角尖上扭曲和舞动，这个腐朽的卢鲁的化身反而是一个栩栩如生的噩梦。",
	"While tainted by the influence of Malar, the avatar of Lurue carries out the Beast Lord's will: to slaughter anything that dares to cross its path.": "虽然受到马拉尔的影响，但鲁鲁修的化身执行了兽王的意志：屠杀任何敢于越过它的人。",
	"When the corrupted unicorn comes into being, it does so within reach of at least one of the cult members. If a fight has not already started, roll initiative. On each of the avatar's turns, and when using its legendary actions, it randomly attacks one or more creatures from among any targets it can reach. The avatar prefers a wounded foe over a fresh one, but it also singles out enemies who deal grievous injuries to it and attacks them without mercy.": "当堕落的独角兽出现时，它至少是在一个邪教成员的范围内。如果战斗还没有开始，就掷出主动权。在化身的每个回合，以及使用它的传奇行动时，它都会从它能触及的任何目标中随机攻击一个或多个生物。与新的敌人相比，化身更喜欢受伤的敌人，但它也会挑出那些对它造成严重伤害的敌人，毫不留情地攻击他们。",
	"The cult members, briefly transfixed by the spectacle they have just witnessed, are not immediately hostile, though they defend themselves against characters who threaten or attack them. When it becomes apparent to the werewolves that they are also being targeted by the avatar, they might join forces with the characters (if the avatar is getting the upper hand) or break off and run away (if the characters seem to be in control of things).": "邪教成员被他们刚刚看到的景象短暂地迷住了，虽然他们对威胁或攻击他们的角色进行自我防卫，但他们并没有立即产生敌意。当狼人发现他们也是化身的目标时，他们可能会与角色联合起来（如果化身占了上风），或者脱离并逃跑（如果角色似乎控制了事情）。",
	"If the characters vanquish the corrupted avatar of Lurue or are in danger of being vanquished themselves, read:": "如果人物战胜了鲁鲁修的腐败化身，或者自己有被战胜的危险，请阅读。",
	"A jagged stroke of white lightning originates from the moon and strikes the unicorn, transforming it into a true, living avatar of Lurue the Unicorn with a silvery mane, shimmering hooves, and a spiraling horn. She gives a thankful nod and bends down to dip her horn, now cleansed of corruption, in the pool.": "一道锯齿状的白色闪电从月亮上发出，击中了独角兽，把它变成了独角兽鲁鲁的真正的、活生生的化身，有银色的鬃毛，闪亮的蹄子和螺旋状的角。她感激地点点头，并弯下腰把她的角，现在已经洗净的腐败，浸入池中。",
	"The lightning bolt from the moon either destroys the corrupted avatar to spare the adventurers from a likely tragic ending, or revives and purifies the slain avatar. (The book speculates that this divine intervention is courtesy of Selûne, who has been waiting for Malar's plan to come to fruition so that she might demonstrate to him the utter futility of his desire to hold sway over the forest.)": "来自月亮的闪电要么摧毁了腐败的化身，使冒险者免于悲惨的结局，要么使被杀的化身复苏并得到净化。(书中推测，这种神圣的干预是由塞卢恩提供的，她一直在等待马拉尔的计划实现，以便向他证明他想控制森林的愿望是完全徒劳的）。",
	"Divine magic pours from Lurue's horn and turns the tainted pool back into silvery, glistening pure water. The Pool of Eternal Spring is restored to its former nature. A short distance away along the bank of the pool is a narrow, spring-fed outlet stream that leads north toward the river. The purifying effect continues to flow into and along the stream, removing all traces of corruption that might have escaped in the current. Her work finished, Lurue lifts her head, regards the characters once more, and prepares to take her leave.": "神圣的魔法从卢鲁的角中涌出，将被污染的水池重新变成银色的、闪闪发光的纯净水。永恒之泉池恢复了它以前的性质。沿着池岸不远处是一条狭窄的、由泉水浇灌的出口小溪，向北通向河流。净化的效果继续流入并沿着溪流，清除所有可能在水流中逃脱的腐败痕迹。她的工作完成了，露露抬起头，再次看了看这些人物，并准备离开。",
	"Regardless of the outcome of the characters' efforts, the book's final scene ends the same:": "无论人物努力的结果如何，该书的最后一幕都是一样的结局。",
	"The avatar of Lurue galloped through the night, freed from the threat of Malar. As a way of showing her gratitude, and ensuring that Malar and his minions would never dare to ravage the forest again, she continued to let the silvery spring flow, turning the place into a Pool of Eternal Silver. These waters, forever protected by her grace, lie near the site of a city now called Silverymoon, which was named as such in honor of this tale.": "鲁鲁修的化身在夜里驰骋，从马拉尔的威胁中解脱出来。为了表达她的感激之情，并确保马拉尔和他的爪牙再也不敢蹂躏这片森林，她继续让银色的泉水流淌，把这个地方变成了一个永恒的银池。这些水在她的恩惠下得到了永远的保护，位于现在被称为 \"银月 \"的城市附近，它的名字就是为了纪念这个故事。",
	"As these words pass into the characters' consciousness, the book begins to pull the characters out of the story.

The glyph disappears once the spell is triggered, rendering the lever safe to use.": "斯通基在杠杆顶部的红色红宝石上施了一个{@spell glyph of warding}的咒语。任何检查杠杆并成功通过DC16智力({@skill Investigation})检查的角色都会发现这个微小的、几乎看不见的石刻。如果石基以外的任何生物移动杠杆，这个石刻就会激活，使房间里充满神奇的闪电。房间里的每一个生物都必须在DC16的灵巧救赎中成功，救赎失败会受到36({@dice 8d8})的闪电伤害，救赎成功会受到一半的伤害。一旦咒语被触发，石刻就会消失，使杠杆可以安全使用。",
	"The lever can be moved to fit into one of three slots, which are labeled Coop, Shed, and Stable, all in Common. The lever is currently in the notch labeled Stable.

	"Stonky and his cult fanatics are in the process of evacuating the chambers beneath the tower, having set the Barn Door on a programmed countdown to launch. But their evacuation has been delayed by an unforeseen complication: Stonky can't find his {@item ring of telekinesis} and doesn't know where he left it.

When that happens, the entire tower flies into the sky, soaring along its preset trajectory. It leaves behind a cloud of smoke large enough to engulf the entire Inner Ward of Candlekeep (treat the area as heavily obscured for 1 minute).

They can also let the Avowed deal with Stonky and his cultists. The Avowed aren't likely to punish Stonky severely for his transgressions, since there are technically no laws against launching rocket ships in Candlekeep.

If they walk far enough into the woods in one direction, they end up on the other side of the forest approaching Wisteria Vale, as if they had walked in a giant loop.

Unable to achieve an immortal state of being, he ordered his most trusted students to infiltrate the library and steal pages from the book that might have a solution to his problem.

Xemru Thaal's note (see the accompanying {@area player handout|42d|x}) still accompanies the book and is tucked in an envelope that bears the seal of the House of the All-Seeing Orb, a temple of Savras in Tashluta, the capital city of Tashalar.": "{@i The Canopic Being}的封面和脊柱由薄薄的水晶片制成，其中嵌有代表眼睛的宝石。每隔一段时间，眼睛就会移动，在不同的位置之间转移视线。书页的边缘是保护性的水晶饰面，上面写满了匆忙的、几乎无法辨认的字迹。Xemru Thaal的笔记（见附带的{@area player handout|42d|x}）仍然伴随着这本书，被塞在一个信封里，信封上有全视球之屋的印章，这是塔什卢塔（Tashluta）首都的萨夫拉斯神庙。",
	"The book describes rituals relating to the creation of a mummy lord. One is a unique and horrific process by which a mummy lord's organs, normally stored in sacred canopic jars during mummification, can be magically preserved and transplanted into living humanoids. The transplant recipients come under the control of the mummy lord, either as living supplicants or mindless golems through which the mummy lord can see and speak. The book also hints of a ritual that can free a servant after the mummy lord is destroyed.": "该书描述了与创造木乃伊领主有关的仪式。其中一个是独特而恐怖的过程，通过这个过程，木乃伊领主的器官，通常在木乃伊化过程中储存在神圣的罐子里，可以被神奇地保存下来，并移植到活人身上。移植对象受木乃伊领主的控制，要么是活生生的祈求者，要么是木乃伊领主可以看到和说话的无意识傀儡。书中还暗示了一种仪式，可以在木乃伊领主被摧毁后释放一个仆人。",

	"Before arriving at Candlekeep, {@i The Canopic Being} was stolen from the person who has most recently made use of it. {@creature Valin Sarnaster|CM} is an honored oracle of Savras, based in the House of the All-Seeing Orb in Tashalar. In accordance with visions she experienced years before, the oracle has embraced undeath by becoming a mummy lord, using the rituals described in the book. The list of names in the back of the book is written by many hands, since it includes creatures bonded to other mummy lords before the tome came to Valin. The names Valin has added at the end are those of the oracle's current and intended victims, as seen in her visions:": "在到达Candlekeep之前，{@i The Canopic Being}是从最近使用过它的人那里偷来的。{@creature Valin Sarnaster|CM}是萨弗拉斯的一位受人尊敬的神谕者，在塔沙拉的全视球之家。根据她多年前经历的幻觉，神谕者通过成为木乃伊领主来拥抱不死之身，使用书中描述的仪式。书后面的名字是由很多人写的，因为它包括在这本书来到瓦林面前之前与其他木乃伊领主结合的生物。瓦林在最后加上的名字是神谕的当前和预期受害者的名字，正如她在幻觉中看到的那样。",

	"If the characters ask to see Xemru, Shir says that the high priest went through the portal to visit Valin eight months ago and has not come back. Messages received from him through Valin's attendant, Alessia, say that he continues to study with Valin and plans to remain with her for the foreseeable future. (Xemru accepted the future in which he saw himself becoming Valin's servant.

": "如果人物要求见Xemru，Shir说大祭司八个月前通过传送门去拜访Valin，现在还没有回来。他通过瓦林的侍从阿莱西亚收到的信息说，他继续和瓦林一起学习，并计划在可预见的未来继续和她在一起。(Xemru接受了他看到自己成为瓦林的仆人的未来。但一种忧虑感使他把{@i The Canopic Being}送到烛台镇，作为瓦林成为的证据--正如瓦林已经预见到的那样)。",
	"Valin lives in a secret sanctum, since she would otherwise be sought out by too many people seeking her wisdom and counsel. A portal hidden in the temple complex is the only means of reaching her. The oracle sends her attendant, Alessia, through the portal regularly to convey and receive messages.": "瓦林住在一个秘密的圣殿里，因为否则会有太多的人找她寻求智慧和建议。隐藏在神庙中的一个传送门是接触她的唯一途径。神谕者派她的侍者阿莱西亚定期通过传送门传达和接收信息。",

In the course of their fight to expose and destroy Valin, the characters might gain glimpses of the future or hear coded threats from her about the fate she sees for them. Especially if your campaign is built around an epic story line, these oracular insights can help you foreshadow what's to come.": "瓦林长期以来一直阴谋篡夺萨夫拉斯的角色，通过她的黑暗仪式获得权力，使她能够成为新的命运半神。在她的幻觉中，她已经看到这些人物将挫败她的计划--所以她安排了导致他们来找她的事件，这样她就可以在他们的威胁开始之前结束。在他们揭发和摧毁瓦林的过程中，角色们可能会瞥见未来，或听到她对他们的命运发出的编码威胁。特别是如果你的活动是围绕着一条史诗般的故事线展开的，这些神谕式的见解可以帮助你预示未来的事情。",
	"Valin's tomb exists on its own demiplane. The site was once a temple and was long abandoned until the oracle's magic rediscovered it. It is filled with the signs and symbols of Savras, but whether it was built as a temple to the god or whether it was constructed by Savras when he was still a mortal, not even Valin has been able to determine.": "瓦林的坟墓存在于它自己的半位面。这个地方曾经是一座神庙，长期被遗弃，直到神谕的魔法重新发现了它。它充满了萨弗拉斯的标志和符号，但它是否是作为神的庙宇建造的，还是萨弗拉斯在还是凡人的时候建造的，连瓦林都无法确定。",

	"A ritual known as the rite of reclamation involves claiming some of the dust of Valin's body after she has been reduced to 0 hit points. The ritual describes a process for mixing the dust with wax to create a magic candle, then floating the lit candle in a vessel of holy water. If a creature imbued with one of Valin's organs spends an entire long rest within 5 feet of the candle, the candle is consumed, Valin's organ is destroyed, and the creature's missing organ is restored.

	"The door in the center of the concave wall opens by sliding into the wall, but it's sealed by powerful magic. The door is airtight and imbued with a dimensional lock that prevents characters from teleporting through it. It is impervious to damage, and its magic cannot be dispelled or dismissed by anything short of a {@spell wish} spell. Opening the door requires fitting the three key runes carried by the haven's stone golems (see below) into the three indentations on the door. Any character who has proficiency in the {@skill Arcana} skill recognizes that the indentations have the shape of arcane glyphs. Any inspection of the indentations suggests that each is meant to have an object of the same shape pressed into it.": "凹壁中央的门通过滑入墙壁而打开，但它被强大的魔法所密封。这扇门是密闭的，并被注入了一个维度锁，防止人物通过它进行远程传送。它不受伤害，它的魔力不能被任何东西所驱散，也不能被{@spell wish}法术所解除。打开这扇门需要将避难所的石像鬼携带的三个关键符文（见下文）放入门上的三个凹槽中。任何精通{@skill Arcana}技能的人物都能识别出这些压痕具有奥术字形的形状。对这些压痕的检查表明，每一个压痕都是为了将相同形状的物体压入其中。",

The fight that immediately ensues will have the characters taking on the haven's guardians without knowing what's going on, but the ghost of Zyrian the scrivener can fill them in during the battle.)": "当一个角色第一次试图破坏这扇密封的门，或者用能力检查或魔法打开它，或者如果一个角色碰到任何一个压痕，一个精灵的鬼影就会穿过这扇门。(如果角色试图通过用法术对门造成伤害来破门，请转到下面的 \"打开门\"。在接下来的战斗中，角色们将在不知道发生了什么的情况下与避难所的守护者交手，但文学家Zyrian的鬼魂可以在战斗中向他们介绍情况）。",
	"The spectral elf initially ignores the characters and wanders around the room, nodding and moving his mouth as if speaking to unseen people. If the characters interact with the ghost, or after a few minutes of this one-sided silent conversation, it finally takes notice of them.": "幽灵精灵最初不理会人物，在房间里徘徊，点头和移动嘴巴，好像在和看不见的人说话。如果人物与幽灵互动，或者在这种单方面的无声对话几分钟后，它终于注意到了他们。",
	"If the characters attack Zyrian at once, he fights back and begins to speak, saying, \"You shall not free her! I will protect the free peoples of the world against the Princess of the Shadow Glass until the end of time!\" If the characters show Zyrian the writing of the scrivener's mark on them, the ghost immediately understands what has happened to them and becomes kindly and coherent.": "如果角色们同时攻击Zyrian，他就会反击并开始说话，说：\"你们不能释放她! 我将保护世界上的自由人民，对抗影子玻璃的公主，直到时间的尽头！\" 如果人物向Zyrian展示他们身上的代笔者标记的字迹，鬼魂立即明白他们发生了什么，并变得和善而连贯。",

	"Generations of the haven's scholars bound themselves to defend the site beyond death. Three stone golems and a number of undead scholars (now mummies) protect the site, held in magical stasis until a threat is detected. The masters of the haven once knew the rituals that would summon the keys held by the golems, allowing easy passage through the door to the great library. With those masters long gone, the characters must now defeat the combined forces of the library's guardians to claim the keys.": "避难所的几代学者将自己捆绑在一起，死后也要保卫这个地方。三个石雕和一些不死的学者（现在是木乃伊）保护着这个地方，在发现威胁之前一直处于魔法停滞状态。避难所的主人曾经知道召唤石像鬼所持钥匙的仪式，从而可以轻松通过通往大图书馆的大门。随着这些主人的离去，人物现在必须击败图书馆守护者的联合力量，以获得钥匙。",
	"Zyrian knows that the guardians are summoned when any damage-dealing spell is directed at the door to area H8. When the characters are ready, the ghost wishes them luck.

When the first stone golem is reduced to 0 hit points, its key rune pops out of its crumbling form and the second stone golem appears—along with one more mummy per character to sustain the pressure. The third stone golem emerges 1 round later, along with two more mummies per character. Reducing each golem to 0 hit points allows the characters to claim its key rune.": "战斗开始后，在地图上标有 \"M \"的地方，每个角色会有两个木乃伊从静止状态出现。当这些木乃伊被摧毁一半时，第一个石像和每个角色的另一个木乃伊就会从停滞状态中出现。当第一个石像的命中率降至0时，它的关键符文就会从它破碎的外形中跳出来，第二个石像就会出现--同时每个角色还有一个木乃伊来维持压力。第三只石雕在1个回合后出现，同时每个角色还有两个木乃伊。将每个石像的命中率降至0，使角色能够获得其关键符文。",
	"You can adjust the number of mummies depending on whether the characters are having too easy or too hard a time, with more mummies appearing intermittently until all three key runes are touched to the sealed door. At that point, any remaining mummies disappear as they fall back into stasis, and the sealed door opens.": "你可以根据角色是太容易还是太困难来调整木乃伊的数量，更多的木乃伊会断断续续地出现，直到所有三个关键符文都被触及到密封门。在这一点上，任何剩余的木乃伊都会消失，因为它们重新陷入停滞状态，而密封的门会打开。",

	"The process for destroying the {@creature Nintra Siotta|CM|Princess of the Shadow Glass} can be learned from Zyrian the scrivener in {@area area H4|4b3|x}. The first part of the ritual summons Nintra, who must be reduced to 0 hit points. The second part of the ritual then destroys the Princess of the Shadow Glass for all time (see \"Nintra's End\" below). If the characters do not speak with Zyrian for some reason, spending an hour searching the books of the library turns up references to the ritual that created The Scrivener's Tale and bound Nintra, and to the second part that can destroy the evil archfey.": "摧毁{@creature Nintra Siotta|CM|Princess of the Shadow Glass}的过程可以从{@area area H4|4b3|x}的抄写员Zyrian那里学到。仪式的第一部分是召唤Nintra，Nintra必须被降低到0点生命值。仪式的第二部分会永远摧毁影子玻璃的公主（见下面的 \"Nintra的结局\"）。如果角色们因为某些原因没有和齐瑞安交谈，花一个小时搜索图书馆的书籍，就会发现关于创造《抄写员的故事》和束缚宁特拉的仪式的参考资料，以及关于可以摧毁邪恶大君的第二部分的参考资料。",
	"To begin, a character imbued with the scrivener's mark must stand in the ritual circle, light six candles, and invoke all of the princess's names: {@creature Nintra Siotta|CM}, the Princess of the Shadow Glass, Lady of Dread Omens, and Seeker of the Three Crowns. The marked character must use the parchment and ink found in the circle to express in writing their intent to free Nintra—whereupon the Princess of the Shadow Glass appears in the circle and the fight begins.": "开始时，被赋予文士印记的人物必须站在祭祀圈中，点燃六根蜡烛，并召唤公主的所有名字。{@creature Nintra Siotta|CM}，阴影玻璃的公主，可怕预兆的女士，以及三冠王的探索者。被标记的人物必须用圈中的羊皮纸和墨水来表达他们释放宁特拉的意图--这时，阴影玻璃公主出现在圈中，战斗开始。",

	"As a bonus action in the first round of combat, Nintra summons six shadow glass warriors. Each one steps out of one of the wall-mounted panes of glass around the room and resembles an elf made of smoky gray glass. Use the {@creature gladiator} stat block to represent the glass warriors.

On a failed save, the character's mark becomes one of the next higher level.": "{@creature Nintra Siotta|CM|Nintra}在战斗开始时知道每个角色带有什么类型的文士标记。如果任何角色有一个4级的标记，或者如果Nintra在战斗中遇到了太多困难，需要一个额外的优势，她可以用一个行动来迫使一个角色做一个DC20的魅力储蓄。如果拯救失败，该角色的标记就会变成下一个更高等级的标记。",
	"When {@creature Nintra Siotta|CM|Nintra} is reduced to 0 hit points, she falls to the ground, {@condition unconscious}. To complete the process, a character with one or more levels of the scrivener's mark must extinguish the candles, whereupon Nintra turns to ash, as does The Scrivener's Tale in Candlekeep. The panes of shadow glass lose their magic when Nintra is destroyed and shatter harmlessly, and the scrivener's mark fades from all the characters.": "当{@creature Nintra Siotta|CM|Nintra}的命中率降到0时，她就会倒在地上，{@condition unconscious}。为了完成这个过程，一个拥有一个或多个文士印记等级的角色必须熄灭蜡烛，这时宁特拉就会变成灰烬，就像《文士的故事》在烛台镇一样。当宁特拉被毁时，阴影玻璃板会失去魔力，并无害地破碎，而文士的标记也会从所有人物身上消失。",
	"If the ritual is not completed, Nintra regains all her hit points and expended spells in 1 hour. During that time, she is immune to damage. If she returns to life, Nintra summons six more shadow glass warriors and sets them on the characters, then tries to flee.": "如果仪式没有完成，Nintra会在1小时内恢复她所有的命中率和消耗的法术。在这段时间内，她对伤害是免疫的。如果她恢复了生命，Nintra会再召唤出六个影子玻璃战士，并让他们对付那些人物，然后试图逃跑。",
	"The books in the library amount to nearly ten thousand volumes and cover a host of subjects including arcana, history, and nature. If the characters want to sell the collection, you can decide what it might be worth, but the characters should earn at least 50,000 gp for the lot (see also \"A Little Light Reading\" below). Such a reward might take the form of one or two very rare magic items, a small keep, a large parcel of land, or a seaworthy galley with a full crew.": "图书馆里的书有近万册，涵盖了包括奥术、历史和自然在内的众多主题。如果人物想卖掉这些藏书，你可以决定它的价值，但人物应该为这批书至少赚取50,000金币（另见下面的 \"一点浅阅读\"）。这样的回报可能是一两件非常罕见的魔法物品、一个小庄园、一大片土地，或者一艘有完整船员的适航船。",

	"Ending the threat of the Princess of the Shadow Glass brings the characters to the attention of the Queen of Air and Darkness—whether they want that attention or not. Though the queen does not deign to consider herself in the debt of mortals, she might bestow favors on them if asked, or she could become a powerful but unpredictable ally or patron.": "结束阴影玻璃公主的威胁会使人物受到空气和黑暗女王的关注--无论他们是否想要这种关注。虽然女王不认为自己欠了凡人的债，但如果他们提出要求，她可能会给予他们恩惠，或者她可能成为一个强大但不可预知的盟友或赞助人。",
	"The wealth of knowledge in the great library of the Haven of the Red Quill represents an amazing find for the scholars of Candlekeep.

I'm Candlekeep's foremost expert on this book and its author.\"": "你的向导并没有回来。相反，迎接你的是一个身穿长袍的木精灵，棕色的头发和朴素的脸。她手里拿着一本书，上面布满了地衣，封面几乎无法合上，书页已经发皱。\"我相信你正在寻找这个，\"她带着温暖、明亮的微笑说。\"我的名字是Zelyth Lightleaf。我是烛台镇关于这本书及其作者的最重要专家。\"",
	"A few months ago, Zelyth Lightleaf (neutral good wood elf {@creature sage|CM}; see the \"{@adventure Candlekeep|CM|1}\" section at {@area the front of the book|019|x} for her stat block) joined the Avowed, using the book as her entrance gift into the library. She found it in an abandoned satchel near a secluded cave system called the Lykortha Expanse, which is known among druids for its rare fungal growths. Zelyth assumed the book had been lost and took possession of it.": "几个月前，Zelyth Lightleaf（中性良好的木精灵{@creature sage|CM}；她的状态块见{@area the front of the book|019|x}的\"{@adventure Candlekeep|CM|1} \"部分）加入了Avowed，用这本书作为她进入图书馆的礼物。她在一个叫Lykortha Expanse的隐蔽洞穴系统附近的一个废弃的挎包里发现了这本书，这个洞穴在德鲁伊中以其罕见的真菌生长而闻名。泽利特认为这本书已经丢失了，于是把它占为己有。",

	"Written in Common, {@i Xanthoria} begins with a set of scientific essays about symbiotic relationships in nature before deteriorating into confusing ramblings on the merits and similarities of life and death.

	"Many researchers perused this book over the years it spent in Candlekeep, but knowledge of the command word was useless without the location of the gateway to the mansion—until a chance discovery by the sage Matreous, an expert in the application and removal of curses. Upon arriving at Candlekeep to further his expertise, Matreous cast {@spell detect magic}, as was his habit. The spell revealed a gateway in the very study room he had been assigned!": "多年来，许多研究者在坎德尔堡度过的这本书中进行了研究，但如果不知道通往庄园的入口位置，对命令词的了解就毫无用处——直到一位名叫马特雷斯（Matreous）的智者偶然发现了这一点，他是一位擅长施加和解除诅咒的专家。到达坎德尔堡进一步提升自己的专业知识时，马特雷斯像往常一样施展了{@spell detect magic}这个法术。这个法术揭示了一个入口，就在他被分配的研究室里！",

	"Opening the portal from inside the mansion requires another command word, which Fistandia hid in the form of a puzzle. She created seven books, each with a single gilded letter on its spine. When placed next to each other in the proper order, they spell the command word, \"liberty.\" The books bear not only the lettered spines but also the same image of Mordenkainen that graces the cover of {@i The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces}.": "在庄园内打开传送门需要另一个口令，这个口令是Fistandia隐藏在一个谜题中。她创造了七本书，每本书的书脊上都有一个镀金字母。当按正确顺序摆放在一起时，它们拼出口令“liberty”。这些书不仅有字母书脊，还有与{@i The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces}封面相同的莫登凯因形象。",
	"The imp figurine in Matreous's possession (see {@area area M1|046|x}) appears to be a very detailed carving of an imp made from onyx.

Removing the figurine from the mansion breaks the enchantment and releases the imp.": "Matreous手中的小恶魔雕像（见{@area area M1|046|x}）似乎是用缟玛瑙雕刻而成的，非常详细。然而，这不是一座雕像，而是Fistandia召唤并变成小雕像的一个真实的{@creature imp}。将这个小雕像从豪宅中移走会打破魔法，释放出小恶魔。",

If they feed it or pet it and make a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Animal Handling}) check, it follows them until they leave the study or venture up the stairs, at which time it heads to the kitchen (area M6).

	"A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check knows two vital facts about the homunculi in {@area area M6|056|x}.

	"Two {@condition invisible} {@creature Faerie Dragon (Orange)||orange faerie dragons} are perched in the trees. They are mischievous creatures, always looking for fun, but the homunculi and the cats provide little entertainment, so they hope to keep the characters in the arboretum for as long as possible so they can play with them.

If the characters ask how they got here, they sheepishly explain that the hag caught the two of them and a third dryad named Hanah unawares while they were paying little attention to their surroundings. Trekaila and Argentia are quick to disclose that Hanah was taken away by the hag several hours ago, and they fear that the worst might have happened to her. The dryads tell the characters about seeing the hag return from someplace that lies to the east of the shack and urge them to investigate.": "这两个{@creature Dryad||dryads}分别叫特雷凯拉(Trekaila)和阿金蒂娅(Argentia)。如果角色们解救她们脱离束缚，树精们会表示适当的感激。如果角色们询问她们是怎么到这里的，她们羞怯地解释说，巫婆抓住了她们两个和一个名叫汉娜(Hanah)的第三个树精，当时她们没有留意周围环境。特雷凯拉和阿金蒂娅迅速透露汉娜几个小时前被巫婆带走了，她们担心她可能遭遇了最坏的情况。树精们告诉角色们她们看到巫婆从小屋东边的某处返回，并敦促他们去调查。",

	"A more direct restoration can be undertaken if the creature imbued with one of Valin's organs has been killed and the characters have access to the creature's original organ. Removing Valin's organ from the creature's body reveals it to be shriveled, glassy, and pulsing with unnatural life. If the creature's original organ is replaced within 1 hour of its death at the same time Valin's organ is destroyed, the creature returns to life immediately as if targeted by a {@spell resurrection} spell.

	"Alessia scoffs in response to a suggestion that Valin might be involved in improper activities or evil plots, and insists that the characters will know better once they speak with her. If the idea that Valin might be a mummy lord is mentioned, Alessia confirms that she sees the oracle regularly and that Valin appears quite normal. (This is a product of the mummy lord's diadem, which functions as a {@item hat of disguise}.)": "艾莉西娅对有人暗示瓦林可能参与不当活动或邪恶阴谋的建议不屑一顧，并坚称角色们一旦与她交谈就会知道真相。如果有人提到瓦林可能是一位木乃伊领主，艾莉西娅确认她经常见到神谕，并且瓦林看起来非常正常。（这是木乃伊领主的冠冕，它的功能类似于一个{@item hat of disguise}。）",

	"Though most of the crystals piled in the corner are of no value, a 10-minute search of the pile yields ten fine gemstones worth 500 gp each. One of these crystals radiates an aura of transmutation magic under the scrutiny of a {@spell detect magic} spell.

	"Word of Mayastan Sadaar's death hits the scholars of Candlekeep hard. At your discretion, the characters can return the scholar's body to Candlekeep so that she can be returned to life (perhaps with the characters performing the rites).

	"Candlekeep received {@i The Scrivener's Tale} ten years ago from Machil Rillyn, a noble and a former adventurer from the city of Baldur's Gate. The terms of Machil's gift stipulated that the book was to be locked away and never read. Alas, his stipulation fell on deaf ears. When the book falls by accident into the characters' hands, each of them is afflicted by a supernatural malediction known as the scrivener's mark. The characters must travel to Baldur's Gate to learn the origin of this potentially deadly mark, then retrace Machil Rillyn's steps to a ruined library called the Haven of the Red Quill. All the while, the archfey bound to the book assails their minds, begging to be freed from her dark prison.": "十年前，烛光堡垒从巴尔杜尔之门城的贵族和前冒险家马奇尔·里林（Machil Rillyn）那里收到了《{@i The Scrivener's Tale}》。马奇尔的礼物条款规定这本书必须被锁起来，永远不得阅读。然而，他的规定被置若罔闻。当这本书意外落入角色手中时，他们每个人都受到一种被称为书记员印记的超自然诅咒影响。角色们必须前往巴尔杜尔之门，了解这个潜在致命印记的起源，然后追踪马奇尔·里林的足迹到一个名为红羽笔之地（Haven of the Red Quill）的废弃图书馆。与此同时，被束缚在书中的大妖精袭击他们的心灵，乞求被从她黑暗的监狱中释放。",

The text starts at the character's fingertips and winds around one arm to the shoulder, chest, and back. The lettering in the Elvish script is tiny but precise and legible. Each character also gains the level 1 benefit and drawback of the mark, as noted in the Scrivener's Mark Effects table. Any character marked in this way must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw every third dawn thereafter. On a failed save, the level of that character's mark increases by 1. Each additional level of the mark covers another 20 percent of the character's skin with writing until 80 percent of the character's body is covered; the character also gains a new benefit (up to level 4) and a new drawback, in addition to retaining the ones from lower levels.

While collecting books for several scholars at the same time, Ramilir guesses that he must have accidentally taken {@i The Scrivener's Tale} instead of a book intended for another scholar, then placed the unrecognized tome in with the characters' books.

This story is told in {@i Alkazaar's Appendix}.": "这个冒险围绕着一本薄薄的书籍，名为《{@i Alkazaar's Appendix}》，是1363年DR（龙历）由著名探险家Alkazaar带到了烛光守望。这本薄薄的书与一本更厚的书籍《{@i Alkazaar's Thrilling Tales}》一同来到，Alkazaar在其中记录了他众多英勇壮举。他把这些书籍留给了烛光守望，并且还赠送了一系列现场讲故事的机会。长寿的烛光守望们依然怀念这些表演，并且多年来把这些故事传给了助手们。在所有故事中，有一个故事让烛光守望们至今仍然感到好奇：失落的魔像的传说，讲述了Alkazaar无法完成的冒险。这个故事被收录在《{@i Alkazaar's Appendix}》中。",
	"The Avowed in Candlekeep could bring {@i Alkazaar's Appendix} to the characters' attention and approach the characters (especially if the party has visited Candlekeep before) in hopes that they can complete Alkazaar's unfinished quest and perhaps procure for the library the fabled {@item Nether Scroll of Azumar|CM|Nether Scroll} that Alkazaar believed the golem once guarded.": "在坎德尔堡的宣誓者可能会引起角色们的注意，并接近角色们（特别是如果队伍之前曾访问过坎德尔堡），希望他们能完成阿尔卡扎的未完成任务，并或许为图书馆获取阿尔卡扎相信曾由傀儡守护的传说中的{@item Nether Scroll of Azumar|CM|Nether Scroll}。",
	"In the Anauroch desert, he came across a wandering stone golem. Alkazaar believed this golem was the legendary Sapphire Sentinel, rumored to have been created by Netherese wizards to protect one of the fabled {@i Nether Scrolls} under the control of Prince Hamukai.": "在安诺克沙漠中，他遇到了一座漫游的石像鬼。Alkazaar相信这座石像鬼就是传说中的蓝宝石哨兵，据说是由尼瑟瑞斯巫师创造，用来保护由哈姆凯王子控制的传说中的{@i Nether Scrolls}之一。",
	"When an adventurer activates the portal, it stays active for 1 minute and then reverts back to an ordinary picture. Anyone who touches the activated portal appears instantly in an unoccupied space within 50 feet of the golem (see \"{@area Arriving in Anauroch|4de|x}\" later in the adventure).": "当冒险者激活传送门时，它会保持激活状态1分钟，然后恢复成普通的图片。任何触碰激活传送门的人会立即出现在离傀儡50英尺范围内的一个空地上（详见冒险后期的“{@area Arriving in Anauroch|4de|x}”）。",
	"Long ago, the wizards of Netheril created a magnificent stone golem to guard one of the {@i Nether Scrolls}—a collection of dangerous scrolls that described the creation of magic and the nature of the Weave. The wizards gave the golem a sapphire heart and magically bound a sliver from the gem to the right palm of its master, Hamukai. They charged the young wizard-prince of the ancient nation of Anauria with guarding the priceless scroll. The sapphires allowed both Hamukai and the golem (whether together or separate) to unlock a magically sealed vault that held the {@item Nether Scroll of Azumar|CM|Nether Scroll}.": "很久以前，Netheril的巫师们创造了一个宏伟的石像魔像来守护其中一个{@i Nether Scrolls}——一组描述魔法创造和法术纹理本质的危险卷轴。巫师们给了这个魔像一个蓝宝石之心，并将宝石的一小片魔法绑定到其主人Hamukai的右手掌上。他们委托了古代国家Anauria的年轻巫师王子守护这份无价的卷轴。这些蓝宝石让Hamukai和魔像（无论是一起还是分开）都能打开一个被魔法封印的保险库，里面装有{@item Nether Scroll of Azumar|CM|Nether Scroll}。",
	"The blue dragon {@creature Zikzokrishka|CM} discovered the scroll's location, and she arrived at the vault ready to destroy any and all in her path. In the ensuing battle, the golem gravely wounded {@creature Zikzokrishka|CM}, but she blasted the golem with eldritch magic that damaged its memory and hurled it to a far corner of Faerûn. Thinking his golem destroyed, Hamukai put a shield around the vault containing the scroll that could be opened only by the sapphire's power. Too weak to continue the fight, {@creature Zikzokrishka|CM} limped away to heal her wounds. But as she left, she incanted a powerful Netherese curse: when the prince died, the shield would disappear and the scroll would be hers for the taking.": "蓝龙{@creature Zikzokrishka|CM}发现了卷轴的位置，并来到地下室准备摧毁一切阻挡她去路的东西。在随后的战斗中，傀儡严重伤害了{@creature Zikzokrishka|CM}，但她用奥术魔法轰击了傀儡，损坏了它的记忆，并将其抛向法罗的一个角落。认为自己的傀儡被摧毁，Hamukai在地下室周围放置了一个只能通过蓝宝石力量打开的护盾。{@creature Zikzokrishka|CM}由于伤势过重而无法继续战斗，她一瘸一拐地离开去疗伤。但在离开时，她念起了一道强大的尼瑟瑞斯诅咒：当王子死去时，护盾将消失，卷轴将成为她的战利品。",
	"As she held her vigil, the desert wasteland of Anauroch consumed the city. Believing the golem and its sapphire to be destroyed, {@creature Zikzokrishka|CM} now lies coiled around the vault's entrance, waiting with the patience of undeath for the death of the prince, surrounded by her undead minions and jealously guarding her promise of godhood.": "当她守夜时，安诺罗克（Anauroch）的沙漠荒原吞噬了这座城市。相信傀儡和它的蓝宝石已被摧毁，{@creature Zikzokrishka|CM}现在盘绕在地下室入口周围，以不死之忍耐等待着王子的死亡，她被她的不死手下包围着，嫉妒地守护着她成为神的承诺。",
	"The Bedine allow the characters to examine the 14-foot-tall {@creature stone golem} known as the {@creature Sapphire Sentinel|CM}. It has the following features and behaviors:": "贝丁人允许角色检查这座高14英尺的{@creature stone golem}，被称为{@creature Sapphire Sentinel|CM}。它具有以下特征和行为：",
	"It can open the sealed vault where the prince rests (see {@area area V3|512|x}).": "它可以打开封印的宝库，王子休憩的地方（见{@area area V3|512|x}）。",
	"The sapphire has 3 charges. As an action, the golem can expend 1 charge to cast {@spell dispel magic} (as a 9th-level spell) from the sapphire using Constitution as its spellcasting ability. The sapphire ceases to glow if all its charges are expended, but it regains {@dice 1d3} expended charges daily at dawn and glows again once it has 1 or more charges.": "蓝宝石有3个充能。作为一个动作，傀儡可以消耗1个充能，使用体质作为其施法能力，从蓝宝石中施放{@spell dispel magic}（作为9级法术）。如果所有充能都被消耗完，蓝宝石将不再发光，但它会在每天黎明时恢复{@dice 1d3}个已消耗的充能，并在拥有1个或更多充能时再次发光。",
	"The golem also employs a unique sign language created by its master, Hamukai. Any character who spends 1 hour observing the golem as it uses this sign language can, with a successful DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check, learn enough of the language to communicate with the golem on a basic level. A character who fails the check can repeat it after spending another hour watching the golem communicate in this fashion.": "这个傀儡还使用了它的主人Hamukai创造的一种独特的手语。任何角色花费1小时观察这个傀儡使用这种手语，可以通过成功的DC 20智力检定，学会足够的语言知识，以便与这个傀儡基本交流。检定失败的角色可以在再观察这个傀儡用这种方式交流1小时后重复检定。",
	"For story purposes, the golem or its sapphire must reach {@area area V3|512|x} for the vault to be opened. On seeing the golem restored, {@creature Zikzokrishka|CM} can't contain her glee. She tries to destroy the golem so she can use the sapphire to open the vault and steal the {@item Nether Scroll of Azumar|CM|Nether Scroll}. If the dracolich is defeated, the golem goes to be reunited with its master and complete its mission to deliver Hamukai's body and the {@item Nether Scroll of Azumar|CM|Nether Scroll} to Elysium.": "为了故事需要，傀儡或其蓝宝石必须达到{@area area V3|512|x}，才能打开保险库。看到傀儡恢复，{@creature Zikzokrishka|CM}(Tasha)无法掩饰她的喜悦。她试图摧毁傀儡，以便可以使用蓝宝石打开保险库并窃取{@item Nether Scroll of Azumar|CM|Nether Scroll}。如果骷髅巨龙被打败，傀儡将前去与其主人团聚，并完成将哈姆凯的尸体和{@item Nether Scroll of Azumar|CM|Nether Scroll}(Soulstone)送至艾利西亚的任务。",
	"The characters encounter three {@creature Cyclops||cyclopes} who are bickering at each other while looking for food. They have Bedine prisoners tied up in their lair—a cavernous crack inside a granite escarpment that juts out from the sands.": "角色们遇到了三名互相争吵的{@creature Cyclops||cyclopes}，他们正在寻找食物。他们在自己的巢穴里绑着贝丁俘虏，这个巢穴是一个从沙漠中突出的花岗岩悬崖内的一个洞穴裂缝。",
	"Removing enough debris to allow a Small or Medium humanoid to fit through the opening takes one person about an hour, but the noise caused by the work could summon a hungry purple worm. To avoid doing so, whoever is clearing the rubble must succeed on two DC 15 Dexterity or Strength checks. Failure on either check means a boulder falls from a height or the character slips and causes a cascade of rubble, alerting the worm's {@sense tremorsense|MM}.": "清理足够的碎石以便让一个小型或中型人类通过这个开口需要一个人大约一个小时，但工作所产生的噪音可能会引来一只饥饿的紫色蠕虫。为了避免这种情况，清理碎石的人必须成功通过两次DC 15的敏捷或力量检定。如果在任一次检定中失败，意味着一块巨石从高处掉落，或者角色滑倒并引发一场碎石崩塌，警醒了蠕虫的{@sense tremorsense|MM}。",
	"Once a gap is created, the rubble counts as {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.": "一旦有空隙形成，瓦砾就算作{@quickref difficult terrain||3}。",
	"Whenever the time is right (and it's never not right), a {@creature purple worm} erupts from the earth and attacks the party. This can happen anywhere in the caves at any time.": "每当时机成熟（而且永远不会不成熟）时，一只{@creature purple worm}从地底喷发并袭击队伍。这可能发生在洞穴的任何地方，任何时候。",
	"The brightly colored murals are intact, and {@spell detect magic} or similar magic causes the magic ink that preserves the work to glow.": "这些色彩鲜艳的壁画保存完好，而{@spell detect magic}或类似的魔法使得保护作品的魔法墨水发出微光。",
	"Any Bedine with the party display amazement on seeing the murals, since the works prove that their legends about a city that was destroyed by a dragon are true. Shamir says that he knows of a cursed place in the desert that looks like the ruined city depicted in {@area mural F|501|x}. He is willing to guide the party there.": "当贝丁人看到壁画时，他们中的任何一位都会感到惊讶，因为这些作品证明了他们关于一座被龙摧毁的城市的传说是真实的。夏米尔说他知道沙漠中一个被诅咒的地方，看起来就像{@area mural F|501|x}中描绘的那座废墟城市。他愿意带领队伍前往。",
	"The dragon's name translates as {@creature Zikzokrishka|CM}. The inscription reads: \"Here the Sapphire Sentinel is destroyed in the terrible battle against the dragon {@creature Zikzokrishka|CM}, who curses Hamukai.\"": "这条龙的名字翻译为{@creature Zikzokrishka|CM}。铭文上写着：“这里蓝宝石哨兵在与龙{@creature Zikzokrishka|CM}的可怕战斗中被摧毁，龙咒诅了哈姆凯。”",
	"The crude map shows the location of the city of Azumar relative to Haruun. Following the map correctly requires a successful DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check. If a Bedine is present to consult, the check succeeds automatically.": "这张简陋的地图显示了阿祖玛尔城相对于哈鲁恩的位置。根据地图正确行进需要成功通过一次DC 14的感知检定（智力{@skill Survival}）。如果有贝丁人在场提供咨询，检定自动成功。",
	"After seeing the murals in the Hall of Rainbows, the characters know their next destination: the ruined city of Azumar that is now the necropolis ruled by {@creature Zikzokrishka|CM}. Any Bedine guide knows the tale of the city of Azumar, which was plunged into ruin by a terrible dragon. The Bedine also know of the eternally seething sandstorm there and believe that nothing but death and misfortune lie within the cursed city.": "在看过《彩虹大厅》中的壁画后，角色们知道他们的下一个目的地：废墟之城阿祖玛尔，现在是由{@creature Zikzokrishka|CM}统治的死城。任何贝丁向导都知道阿祖玛尔城的传说，这座城市被一条可怕的龙毁灭。贝丁人也知道那里永远翻腾的沙尘暴，并相信除了死亡和厄运之外，诅咒之城内什么都没有。",
	"The tiny creatures are desert-dwelling {@creature Chwinga|IDRotF|chwingas} (see their stat block at {@area the end of the adventure|524|x}) that live in tiny caves built up on the shell of a giant {@creature dragon tortoise|CM}. If the characters approach the escarpment, the earth rumbles as the {@creature dragon tortoise|CM} raises its massive head out of the sand, addresses them, and asks their intentions.": "这些微小的生物是居住在沙漠中的{@creature Chwinga|IDRotF|chwingas}(请查看它们的属性块在{@area the end of the adventure|524|x})，它们生活在建造在巨大{@creature dragon tortoise|CM}壳上的小洞穴中。如果角色们靠近悬崖，当{@creature dragon tortoise|CM}将它巨大的头从沙子中抬起时，大地会颤抖，它会对他们说话，并询问他们的意图。",

	"The necropolis also contains buried treasures. A character who searches for an hour and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check finds some hidden treasure determined by rolling on the {@book Treasure Hoard: Challenge 5–10 table|DMG|7|Treasure Hoard: Challenge 5—10} in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. Up to four such hoards can be found before the city is picked clean.": "这座死城也埋藏着宝藏。一个角色搜索一个小时并在一次DC 20的智力检定中成功，会根据在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中掷骰子来确定一些隐藏的宝藏。在这座城市被搜刮一空之前，最多可以找到四个这样的宝藏。",
	"The party encounters three {@creature Flameskull||flameskulls} floating around the ruins, each wearing an odd, tattered hat. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check, a character recalls the hats worn by the wizards on the murals in the Hall of Rainbows. (One or more players might remember this even if their characters don't.) The flameskulls are startled upon seeing the adventurers and begin chattering to one another, wondering what to do about these strange visitors.": "当队伍在废墟周围遇到三个{@creature Flameskull||flameskulls}时，每个都戴着奇怪破烂的帽子。通过成功的DC 15智力({@skill Investigation})检定，角色回忆起彩虹大厅壁画上巫师戴的帽子。(即使角色不记得，一个或多个玩家可能会记得这一点。) 火焰头颅看到冒险者感到惊讶，开始互相交谈，想知道如何处理这些奇怪的访客。",
	"These are the remains of the Consortium of Three, the Netherese wizards who were loyal to Prince Hamukai.

	"A character with a knife or other small blade can use an action to try to cut a subject free of the mycelium, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. On a failed check, the character takes 20 ({@dice 4d8}) necrotic damage and disturbs the mycelium; roll a {@dice d6} and refer to the Mycelium Effects table. Fungus creatures and those that have been infected with saprophytic plague are immune to these effects and are not targeted by them.": "一个拿着刀或其他小刀的角色可以使用一个动作来尝试切断被菌丝束缚的目标，成功时需要进行一次 DC 20 力量检定（{@skill Athletics}）。如果检定失败，角色会受到 20 点死灵伤害（{@dice 4d8}），并扰乱菌丝；然后投掷一个 {@dice d6}，并参考菌丝效应表。真菌生物和那些被腐生瘟疫感染的生物对这些效应免疫，不会成为目标。",

	"If the mycelium is destroyed, the room is engulfed in a psychic backlash. Those present receive visions of an endless forest of tower-sized mushrooms, a woman wearing a holy symbol of Sylvanus running between them crying gooey, ochre tears, and a skull-splitting cry of anguish.

Thunderwing is immune to these visions.": "如果菌丝体被摧毁，房间将被一股心灵反冲所吞噬。在场的人会看到无尽的高塔般大小的蘑菇森林，一个戴着西尔瓦努斯（Sylvanus）神圣标记的女人在它们之间奔跑，流出粘稠的赭色眼泪，并发出撕心裂肺的哀嚎。洞穴中的每个生物必须通过一次DC 16感知豁免检定，否则将受到44 ({@dice 8d10}) 精神伤害。雷翼（Thunderwing）对这些幻象免疫。",
	"This room was Xanthoria's sleeping chamber, though once she completed her transformation into a lichen lich, she had no more need of it. At the back of the cave lurks a strange bundle of white poison ivy with a single bulbous eye in the center (use the {@creature death tyrant} stat block, but omit its lair actions and regional effects). In the middle of the room, a mold-encrusted skeleton jerkily rises, wearing armor made of calcified lichen and covered in fungal growths (use the {@creature death knight} stat block).": "这个房间是赞索瑞亚(Xanthoria)的卧室，尽管她完成了蜘蛛地衣巫妖的转变后，她再也不需要它了。在洞穴的后面潜伏着一团奇怪的白色毒藤蔓，中间有一个球状的眼睛（使用{@creature death tyrant}的属性块，但省略其巢穴动作和地域效果）。在房间中央，一个长满霉菌的骷髅僵硬地站起来，穿着由钙化地衣制成的盔甲，覆盖着真菌生长物（使用{@creature death knight}的属性块）。",
	"If one or more characters enter this cave, the white vines clinging to the walls quiver as the purple flowers open wide and spread their sweet scent.

	"Characters can kill the vines by attacking their root in the center of the room. Treat the root as an immobile, Medium object with AC 15 and 100 hit points. When the root is reduced to 0 hit points, the vines release spores into the air as they die. These spores attach themselves to all creatures in the cave and have no effect until those covered with them face off against Xanthoria (see {@area area L11|55b|x}). Those who are exposed to the spores but take the time to wash themselves off with water suffer no ill effects.": "角色可以通过攻击房间中心的根部来消灭藤蔓。将根部视为一个不动的、中型物体，AC为15，有100点生命值。当根部的生命值降至0时，藤蔓释放孢子进入空气中，随着它们的死亡。这些孢子会附着在洞穴中的所有生物身上，在这些被覆盖的生物面对赞索瑞亚（见{@area area L11|55b|x}）时才会产生影响。那些暴露在孢子中但花时间用水清洗身体的人不会受到任何不良影响。",

	"Searching the room uncovers a recipe book wrapped in oilcloth under a pile of refuse.

	"This is Xanthoria's space for meditation and relaxation. The murals covering the lower chamber's walls are truly disturbing; their colors, textures, and patterns are nauseating to behold. Any character who takes the time to study the murals and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check uncovers subtle symbology related to the worship of Zuggtmoy. A character who succeeds on this check must then succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or become afflicted with the madness of Zuggtmoy (see \"{@area Madness of Zuggtmoy|534|x}\" earlier in the adventure).": "这是Xanthoria的冥想和放松空间。覆盖下层房间墙壁的壁画真是令人不安；它们的颜色、质地和图案令人作呕。任何角色花时间研究这些壁画并在一次DC 20智力检定中成功后，会发现与祭拜祖格摩伊有关的微妙象征。成功通过这次检定的角色必须接着进行一次DC 16魅力豁免检定，否则会受到祖格摩伊的疯狂影响（见冒险中前面的“{@area Madness of Zuggtmoy|534|x}”）。",

	"The behirs avoid the fog by crawling along the walls and ceiling. When a creature enters the fog for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of {@condition exhaustion}. A creature that makes a successful saving throw against the fog becomes immune to it for the next 24 hours (although levels of {@condition exhaustion} already gained aren't removed).": "贝西尔们通过沿着墙壁和天花板爬行来避开雾气。当生物在回合中第一次进入雾气或在其中开始回合时，必须成功通过一次 DC 16 的体质豁免才能避免获得 1 级 {@condition exhaustion}。成功豁免雾气的生物在接下来的 24 小时内对其免疫（尽管已获得的 {@condition exhaustion} 级别不会被移除）。",
	"The yellowed skeleton of a tiny dragon with a second head, all its flesh rotted away.

	"Xanthoria should be well prepared for the adventurers by the time they arrive at her warped druid grove and laboratory. She has called a {@creature nalfeshnee} named Danjak to her service. Danjak is an emissary of Zuggtmoy, and the demon's form is crusted and interwoven with a riotous blend of molds, lichen, and fungi. He lurks at the back of the cave, awaiting Xanthoria's command before stepping out of the shadows. Additionally, nearby lurks the rotting husk of an infected {@creature treant} ready to defend its master. The treant can't use its Animate Trees action here, since there are no other trees in the vicinity. In addition to the treant, four {@condition invisible} {@creature Will-o'-Wisp||will-o'-wisps} flit about the grove, ready to use Consume Life on adventurers who fall in battle.": "当冒险者们抵达扭曲的德鲁伊树林和实验室时，Xanthoria 应该已经为他们做好了充分准备。她召唤了一名 {@creature nalfeshnee}，名叫丹贾克（Danjak）。丹贾克是祖格摩伊（Zuggtmoy）的使者，恶魔的形态被各种霉菌、地衣和真菌交织覆盖。他潜伏在洞穴的深处，等待着 Xanthoria 的命令才会走出阴影。此外，附近潜伏着一只感染的 {@creature treant} 的腐烂外壳，准备保卫它的主人。树人在这里无法使用其“树木活化”行动，因为附近没有其他树木。除了树人外，还有四只 {@condition invisible} {@creature Will-o'-Wisp||will-o'-wisps} 在树林中飞舞，准备对战斗中倒下的冒险者使用“吞噬生命”能力。",
