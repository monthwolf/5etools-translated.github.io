	"Welcome to Restoring Harmony, the final chapter of a Dungeons & Dragons adventure series in collaboration with the tasty and colorful world of NERDS.": "欢迎来到《恢复和谐》，这是《龙与地下城》冒险系列的最后一章，与美味而多彩的NERDS世界合作。",
	"To run this adventure, you need the fifth edition Basic Rules for D&D, which is available to download for free here.": "要运行这个冒险，你需要第五版《D&D基本规则》，可以在这里免费下载。",
	"Adventure Together takes approximately 60-90 minutes to play. Before you play this adventure, have your players level up their NERDS adventurers to level 3.": "一起冒险》大约需要60-90分钟的时间来玩。在你玩这个冒险之前，让你的玩家把他们的NERDS冒险家的等级提高到3级。",
	"The previous mini-adventures are:": "以前的小型冒险是。",
	"Ever jealous of the cheery dispositions and colorful deliciousness of the NERDS, {@creature Emo|NRH-AT} the beholder and his hired muscle, {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}, have struck a blow against the NERDS' beloved city of Harmony. After years of searching, the nefarious duo have found the sacred Prismatic Well that gives Harmony its vibrant and fabulous colors. Now, with access to the Prismatic Well, {@creature Emo|NRH-AT} and {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT} have begun to leech the color from the city of Harmony. If they aren't stopped, the city will gradually turn gray, with everything eventually becoming black and white.": "一直以来，嫉妒NERDS的快乐性格和多彩的美味，{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}的看客和他的雇佣兵，{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}，对NERDS心爱的城市Harmony进行了打击。经过多年的搜寻，这对邪恶的二人组已经找到了神圣的棱镜井，它赋予了和谐城鲜艳而美妙的色彩。现在，在获得了棱镜井之后，（2%）和（3%）已经开始从和谐城中吸取颜色。如果不阻止他们，这个城市将逐渐变成灰色，所有东西最终都会变成黑白的。",
	"To the NERDS, the colors beginning to flicker and drain out of Harmony is an unsettling mystery. What brings the colors to Harmony is an enigma to them. All they can do is hope the power comes back on and restores the vibrancy of Harmony's colors once more.": "对于NERDS来说，颜色开始闪烁并从Harmony中流失是一个令人不安的谜。是什么给和谐号带来了色彩，对他们来说是个谜。他们所能做的就是希望电力恢复，再次恢复和谐号的色彩活力。",
	"But one group knows what's up, and that group is the Lorekeeper Society—a secret society sworn to protect Harmony. The Lorekeepers know about the power of the Prismatic Well, but its true location is lost even to themselves. However, they have a way to find the well using an ancient artifact known as the Amulet of Harmony, but to activate it they need to find the six Gems of Power. Once activated, the amulet guides whoever controls it to the secret location of the Prismatic Well. But once activated, the amulet also has the power to turn off the well.": "但有一个团体知道这是怎么回事，这个团体就是传说守护者协会--一个发誓要保护和谐的秘密团体。守望者协会知道棱镜井的力量，但它的真实位置连他们自己都不知道。然而，他们有办法通过一个被称为 \"和谐护身符 \"的古老神器来找到这口井，但要激活它，他们需要找到六颗力量宝石。一旦激活，护身符会引导控制它的人到达棱镜井的秘密地点。但是一旦激活，护身符也有能力关闭水井。",
	"The Gems of Power were long ago hidden away for safekeeping in dungeons, forests, and towers. No one in the Lorekeeper Society knows the details of the magical beasts and traps guarding the gems, but our heroic NERDS are more than up to the challenge of restoring Harmony!": "力量宝石很久以前就被藏在地牢、森林和塔楼里保管起来了。守望者协会中没有人知道守护宝石的魔兽和陷阱的细节，但我们英勇的NERDS足以应对恢复和谐的挑战!",
	"Now that there are multiple characters in this adventure, there's less chance of a TPK (total party kill), and the game can continue even if one character is killed. However, in D&D, the possibility of killing player characters is an issue best dealt with up front by having a chat with your players. Some players love the tension of knowing that their characters could die, and they embrace the strategic challenge. Other players loathe the idea their character could die. Knowing what your players enjoy is the key to having a fun session of D&D.": "现在这个冒险中有多个角色，发生TPK（全军覆没）的机会就少了，即使有一个角色被杀，游戏也可以继续进行。然而，在D&D中，杀死玩家角色的可能性是一个最好的问题，可以通过与你的玩家进行交谈来预先处理。有些玩家喜欢知道他们的角色可能死亡的紧张感，他们接受这种战略挑战。其他玩家则厌恶他们的角色可能死亡的想法。了解你的玩家喜欢什么，是获得有趣的D&D会议的关键。",
	"For players who don't like the idea of their character dying—or who just enjoy roleplaying—it's good to always present options other than combat, such as making friends with the monster or tricking the monster. With any of the encounters in this adventure, feel free to present opportunities for unconventional solutions and alternatives to combat.": "对于那些不喜欢自己的角色死亡的玩家来说，或者只是喜欢角色扮演的玩家来说，最好总是提出战斗以外的选择，比如与怪物交朋友或者欺骗怪物。对于这次冒险中的任何一个遭遇，都可以自由地提出非常规的解决方案和战斗以外的选择。",
	"You may also adjust the story to be more benevolent in nature, allowing automatic successes for clever ideas, letting monsters become instant friends, or giving your player advantage on all their rolls.": "你也可以把故事调整得更加仁慈，允许聪明的想法自动成功，让怪物瞬间成为朋友，或者让你的玩家在所有的卷轴上获得优势。",
	"The intent of the final adventure is to feature all six NERDS and have them experience the power of collaboration. If there are fewer players at the table than there are NERDS characters, the missing characters can be NPCs run by you or some of the players.": "最后一次冒险的意图是让所有六个NERDS都出场，让他们体验合作的力量。如果桌子上的玩家少于NERDS的角色，缺少的角色可以是由你或一些玩家经营的NPC。",
	"Give the character sheets of all six NERDS to your players and let them familiarize themselves with their characters.": "把所有六个NERDS的角色表交给玩家，让他们熟悉自己的角色。",
	"All creatures or NPCs that are bolded have stat blocks, which are included at the end of the adventure along with any magic items the characters can earn.": "所有被加粗的生物或NPC都有状态块，这些状态块和人物可以获得的任何魔法物品一起包含在冒险结束时。",
	"Whenever you're both ready, you can start the session.": "每当你们都准备好了，你们就可以开始治疗了。",
	"The city of Harmony is a vibrant metropolis that has been experiencing a strange case of \"color outages\" for weeks. Rumors fly around about what might be causing the problem and the citizens of Harmony are growing increasingly worried as the color vanishes from the environment.": "和谐市是一个充满活力的大都市，几周来一直经历着 \"颜色中断 \"的奇怪情况。关于什么原因可能导致这个问题的谣言满天飞，随着颜色从环境中消失，和谐城的市民越来越担心。",
	"Six daring NERDS have been hired by Mr. Honeycutt to help the secret order known as the Lorekeeper Society to retrieve six magic gemstones known as the Gems of Power. The NERDS are now gathered together at Mr. Honeycutt's secret hideout, hidden under the Sweet Spot candy store, to activate the {@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}.": "六个大胆的NERDS受雇于Honeycutt先生，帮助被称为Lorekeeper Society的秘密组织找回六颗被称为 \"力量宝石 \"的神奇宝石。NERDS现在聚集在Honeycutt先生的秘密藏身处，藏在Sweet Spot糖果店下面，以激活{@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}。",
	"The heroes and Mr. Honeycutt are assembled underneath Mr. Honeycutt's candy shop, the Sweet Spot. After his job at the Library is done, Mr. Honeycutt opens the doors of his sweetshop to delight the populace with his tasty confections—but now his colorful sweets seem dull in the shop window as the world of Harmony fades to dismal gray.": "英雄们和Honeycutt先生在Honeycutt先生的糖果店 \"甜蜜点 \"下面集合。在图书馆的工作结束后，霍尼卡特先生打开了他的糖果店的大门，用他的美味糖果取悦民众--但现在他五颜六色的糖果在商店的橱窗里显得黯淡无光，因为和谐的世界渐渐变成了凄凉的灰色。",
	"Read or paraphrase the following:": "阅读或转述以下内容。",
	"Mr. Honeycutt explains that he doesn't know what's going to happen when he opens the box and puts the gems in the amulet—all the old records have been lost or destroyed. He asks Yellow the Cleric and the Purple the Wizard if they have any ideas of how best to proceed with restoring this magic item. He also asks the group to discuss which of them will attune to the amulet and use its power.": "霍尼科特先生解释说，他不知道当他打开盒子并把宝石放进护身符时会发生什么--所有的旧记录都已丢失或被毁。他问牧师Yellow和巫师Purple，他们是否有任何关于如何最好地恢复这个魔法物品的想法。他还要求大家讨论他们中的哪一位将与护身符相适应并使用其力量。",
	"When everyone is ready, Mr. Honeycutt (or whoever volunteers) opens the box. Instantly, the Gems of Power all leap into their settings on the amulet, resizing themselves until they are each about the size of a thumbnail. The amulet softly glows.": "当所有人都准备好后，霍尼卡特先生（或任何自愿者）打开盒子。瞬间，力量宝石都跃入护身符上的设置，调整自己的大小，直到它们都有拇指甲那么大。护身符发出柔和的光芒。",
	"After one of the characters attunes the amulet, they begin to feel a pull, an urge to move in a certain direction. Honeycutt explains that this amulet knows the location of the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT} and will lead the character right to its location. When the party goes outside, they see Mystery Mountain in the distance and the character who is attuned to the amulet can sense that the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT} is within the mountain. If the character tells Mr. Honeycutt this, he takes off his glasses and says, \"So, Mystery Mountain! I knew it!\"": "在其中一个角色调整了护身符后，他们开始感觉到一种拉力，一种向某个方向移动的冲动。霍尼卡特解释说，这个护身符知道{@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT}的位置，并会引导角色直接到达它的位置。当一行人走到外面时，他们会看到远处的神秘山，而与护身符相适应的人物可以感觉到（1%）就在山里。如果这个人物把这个消息告诉了Honeycutt先生，他就会摘下眼镜说：\"那么，神秘山! 我就知道！\"",
	"Mr. Honeycutt gives each character a {@item potion of healing} and wishes them all the best on their quest. He would come with them, but he is working with the Lorekeeper Society on a spell to help the citizens who are dealing with the increasing lack of color in the city.": "霍尼卡特先生给了每个角色一个{@item potion of healing}，并祝愿他们在探索过程中一切顺利。他本想和他们一起去，但他正在和洛尔守护者协会一起研究一个法术，以帮助那些正在处理城市中越来越缺乏色彩的市民。",
	"The trail to Mystery Mountain is a long hike up into the misty, tree-covered hills outside of Harmony. The {@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT} pulls its bearer ever closer to the steep granite sides of the mountain that looms above them.": "通往神秘山的小路是一条漫长的徒步旅行，进入和谐城外雾气缭绕、树木丛生的山丘。{@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}拉着它的携带者越来越接近那座在他们上方隐约可见的陡峭的花岗岩山体。",
	"The journey can be uneventful, or you can introduce one or both of the following encounters.": "旅程可以是平淡无奇的，或者你可以引入以下一种或两种遭遇。",
	"The crevasse is small, making the climb difficult, but a character who succeeds on a DC 14 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check can wriggle down and get the cublets back up to safety with their grateful mother.": "这条裂缝很小，爬起来很困难，但如果一个角色在DC14力量({@skill Athletics})检查中成功，就可以挣扎着爬下去，把小熊和它们感激的母亲一起带回安全地带。",
	"The interior of Mystery Mountain is a series of roughly carved tunnels. They have the following properties unless otherwise noted:": "神秘山的内部是一系列粗雕细琢的隧道。除非另有说明，否则它们具有以下特性。",
	"The tunnels and caves contain no light sources.": "隧道和洞穴中没有光源。",
	"The passages are 10 feet wide and tall, with ceilings that are roughly 20 feet high.": "通道有10英尺宽和高，天花板大约有20英尺高。",
	"The following locations are keyed to the Mystery Mountain map:": "以下地点是以神秘山地图为关键。",
	"The entrance to Mystery Mountain is hidden behind the exposed roots of a tree that sits over the door. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) roll finds the door in under five minutes. On a failure, the party must search for half an hour before discovering the door and has a 50% chance of encountering six {@creature skeleton||skeletons} on patrol for {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}. Whoever is attuned to the {@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT} has advantage on the check to notice the door.": "神秘山的入口隐藏在一棵树的裸露根部后面，这棵树就在门的上方。一个角色如果在DC12智慧（{@skill Perception}）卷中成功，可以在5分钟内找到这扇门。如果失败，队伍必须搜索半小时才能发现这扇门，并且有50%的机会遇到六个{@creature skeleton||skeletons}在巡逻的{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}。与{@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}相适应的人在注意到这扇门的检查中具有优势。",
	"Behind the roots, the entrance is carved into the granite cliff. There are lightning bolts carved into the granite door, and it has a keyhole but no handle.": "在树根后面，入口被刻在花岗岩悬崖上。花岗岩门上刻有闪电，门上有一个钥匙孔，但没有把手。",
	"The key to the door is in {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}'s pocket, so the lock must be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check. On a failure, the character who attempted to pick the lock takes 6 ({@damage 1d12}) lightning damage and is pushed back 5 feet.": "门的钥匙在{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}的口袋里，所以必须用DC15的灵巧({@skill Sleight of Hand})检查成功来撬锁。如果失败，试图撬锁的角色会受到6({@damage 1d12})的雷电伤害，并被推后5英尺。",
	"Once the door is open, the party can see a cobweb-filled tunnel leading into the darkness of Mystery Mountain.": "门一打开，一行人就能看到一条布满蜘蛛网的隧道，通向神秘山的黑暗。",
	"The gas is coming from a 4-foot-square wooden box sitting on a table in the center of the room. The box has five wooden levers on its side. On the box is a brass plaque that says, \"{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}'s Gaseous Box.\"": "气体来自一个4英尺见方的木箱，放在房间中央的桌子上。盒子的侧面有五个木制杠杆。盒子上有一个铜牌，上面写着：\"（%%）的气体盒子\"。",
	"If the correct lever is pulled, the gas stops coming from the box, and it takes about 5 minutes to dissipate from the area.": "如果拉动正确的杠杆，气体就会停止从盒子里出来，大约需要5分钟才能从这里消散。",
	"If an incorrect lever is pulled or the box takes more than 5 points of damage, it explodes. Each creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 ({@damage 2d6}) piercing damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.": "如果拉错了杆子或者盒子受到超过5点的伤害，它就会爆炸。15英尺范围内的每个生物都必须做一个DC12的灵巧救赎，救赎失败时受到7({@damage 2d6})的穿刺伤害，救赎成功时受到一半的伤害。",
	"In this room are ten {@creature skeleton||skeletons}, all in matching coveralls with a logo on the back that reads, \"{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}'s Garden Care.\" The skeletons are standing around gardening equipment—two wheelbarrows, a scythe, rakes, hoes, a pickaxe, and some pruning shears.": "在这个房间里有十个{@creature skeleton||skeletons}，都穿着配套的工作服，背后有一个标志，上面写着\"{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}的花园护理\"。这些骷髅站在园艺设备周围--两辆手推车、一把镰刀、耙子、锄头、一把镐头和一些修枝剪。",
	"If the party attacks the dormant skeletons, the skeletons are surprised (see the rules for Surprise in the D&D Basic Rules) and the party has advantage on their attacks during the first round of combat.": "如果一方攻击休眠的骷髅，骷髅会受到惊吓（见《D&D基本规则》中的惊吓规则），并且一方在第一轮战斗中的攻击具有优势。",
	"Other than the gardening equipment, there's nothing of value in the room.": "除了园艺设备外，房间里没有任何有价值的东西。",
	"This long cavern runs perpendicular to the passageway. A 20-foot-wide chasm, whose bottom cannot be seen, lies in between the western and eastern passages. A door can be seen in the eastern passage.": "这条长长的洞穴与通道垂直而行。在西边和东边的通道之间有一条20英尺宽的鸿沟，其底部无法看到。在东边的通道里可以看到一扇门。",
	"If the ghouls are following the characters after they cross the chasm, they can flee through the door and bar it behind them.": "如果食尸鬼在越过鸿沟之后还跟着人物，他们可以从门里逃出来，并在身后把门堵住。",
	"As the DM, you can also describe a whole horde of ghouls clawing their way up the chasm—but only to generate tension. Keep reminding your players of the danger through the sound they make—clawing and hissing—as they come up the chasm. You could make it so that the ghouls arrive just as the party flees through the door and they can hear the scratching and shrieking as they lower the bolt to bar the door. If the party returns to the door later, the ghouls have gone back down into the chasm.": "作为管理人，你也可以描述一大群食尸鬼张牙舞爪地往上爬，但这只是为了制造紧张。通过它们发出的声音--爪子和嘶嘶声--不断提醒你的玩家危险的存在。你可以让食尸鬼在队伍逃出门外时到达，当他们放下门闩时可以听到抓挠和嘶吼声。如果一行人后来回到门前，食尸鬼已经回到了鸿沟里。",
	"If a character should be so unlucky as to fall into the chasm, you can have them grab a hold of a random root or ledge to save themselves from certain doom and let them climb out with the assistance of a rope. However, falling into the chasm alerts the ghouls (see \"Building Tension,\" above).": "如果一个角色很不幸地掉进了鸿沟，你可以让他们抓住一个随机的树根或壁架，使自己免于厄运，并让他们在绳子的帮助下爬出来。然而，落入鸿沟会惊动食尸鬼（见上文 \"建立紧张关系\"）。",
	"Maud's goons are laughing as they turn the flumphs upside-down and try to make them turn a stronger shade of purple—a particularly twisted activity in these times when colors are all but gone from the world.": "莫德的手下在大笑，他们把花瓶倒过来，试图让它们变成更浓的紫色--在这个颜色几乎从世界上消失的时代，这是个特别扭曲的活动。",
	"{@creature Maude|NRH-AT}, the bugbear chief, is charged with protecting the secret door to the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT} in area M6. If the characters are getting close to the door, she commands her goons to attack. {@creature Maude|NRH-AT} is arrogant, but she isn't a dummy, and she tries to put off the party by telling them lies like:": "{@creature Maude|NRH-AT}，虫族首领，负责保护M6区通往{@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT}的秘密大门。如果人物接近门，她就会命令她的手下进行攻击。{@creature Maude|NRH-AT}很傲慢，但她并不是一个笨蛋，她试图通过告诉他们一些谎言来搪塞对方。",
	"They're too late.": "他们太晚了。",
	"There's no well here. It's actually underneath Harmony.": "这里没有井。它实际上是在Harmony的下面。",
	"They're in the wrong place.": "他们在错误的地方。",
	"If the adventurers show {@creature Maude|NRH-AT} the {@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}, she demands that they give it to her, saying that her boss will pay handsomely for it. If the adventurers refuse, {@creature Maude|NRH-AT} tells the goons to get it.": "如果冒险者给{@creature Maude|NRH-AT}看了{@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}，她就要求他们把它给她，说她的老板会付很高的报酬。如果冒险者拒绝，{@creature Maude|NRH-AT}就叫手下的人去拿。",
	"If the adventurers seem friendly or try to protect the flumphs, then one of the party members is contacted telepathically by the leader of the flumphs, GuBu, who reveals two things:": "如果冒险者看起来很友好，或者试图保护弗洛姆人，那么其中一名成员就会被弗洛姆人的领袖古布以心灵感应的方式联系上，古布会透露两件事。",
	"GuBu knows the location of the secret door in this room and will help the party as best they can. GuBu is willing to do just about anything (except for sacrificing themselves or one of their cloister mates) to get rid of the bugbears so they can go back to their idyllic underground existence.": "GuBu知道这个房间里的秘密门的位置，并会尽力帮助党。GuBu愿意做任何事情（除了牺牲自己或他们的一个回廊伙伴）来摆脱虫子，以便他们能够回到他们田园般的地下生活。",
	"GuBu has overheard the \"Gray Man\" talking to {@creature Maude|NRH-AT} about \"killing {@creature Emo|NRH-AT}.\" If asked about \"{@creature Emo|NRH-AT},\" GuBu responds that {@creature Emo|NRH-AT} is a \"sad ball\" and that all the flumphs feel sad for it and hope it will get better. GuBu wonders if the sad ball would one day like to join their cloister.": "GuBu偷听到 \"灰人 \"与{@creature Maude|NRH-AT}谈论 \"杀死{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}\"。如果被问及\"{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}\"，GuBu回答说{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}是一个 \"悲伤的球\"，所有Flumphs都为它感到悲伤，希望它能好起来。GuBu想知道这个悲伤的球是否有一天愿意加入他们的回廊。",
	"The Gray Man is scary, dangerous, and wants to \"destroy all the color.\" GuBu telepathically shudders at the thought.": "灰色人是可怕的、危险的，并想 \"摧毁所有的颜色\"。GuBu心灵感应地对这个想法感到震惊。",
	"The secret door to area M6 is well hidden behind a crate. If a character listens at the door and succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, they can hear weeping and arguing, as well as a faint humming sound. The secret door is not locked and opens smoothly when pushed.": "通往M6区的暗门被很好地隐藏在一个箱子后面。如果一个角色在门前倾听并成功通过DC14智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查，他们可以听到哭泣和争吵的声音，以及微弱的嗡嗡声。这扇秘密的门没有上锁，推开后可以顺利打开。",
	"When the adventurers enter this cavern, read or paraphrase the following:": "当冒险者们进入这个洞穴时，请阅读或转述以下内容。",
	"Next to the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT} is a depressed-looking spherical creature that has flexible tubes hooked up to its ten drooping eyestalks. The tubes are connected to a complex apparatus that is placed over the opening of the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT}. The apparatus appears to be sucking colors from the well and feeding it into the spherical creature through the tubes connected to its eyestalks—although the apparatus looks like it isn't working very well, as colors are spraying and fizzing out into the room. The creature is weeping in frustration and desperately trying to figure out how to fix its apparatus.": "在{@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT}旁边是一个看起来很压抑的球形生物，它的十个下垂的眼柄上挂着灵活的管子。这些管子与一个复杂的装置相连，这个装置被放置在（1%）的开口处。这个仪器似乎在从井里吸食颜色，并通过连接到它的眼梗的管子将其送入球形生物--尽管这个仪器看起来工作得不是很好，因为颜色正在向房间里喷洒和晕开。该生物正在沮丧地哭泣，并拼命想办法修复它的仪器。",
	"Next to the many-eyed creature is a tall brute of a man in a gray coat, who is bellowing at the creature angrily. Lurking behind the man's overcoat is a monster about the size of a dog with a single, baleful eye.": "在这个多眼怪物的旁边是一个身穿灰色大衣的高大的野蛮人，他正愤怒地对这个怪物吼叫。潜伏在该男子大衣后面的是一个和狗差不多大小的怪物，有一只秃顶的眼睛。",
	"The spherical monster is {@creature Emo|NRH-AT}, a {@creature beholder}. The brutish man is {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT} and the small monster with a single eye is Furzle, {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}'s {@creature nothic} assistant.": "球形怪物是{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}，一个{@creature beholder}。野蛮人是{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}，单眼的小怪物是Furzle，{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}的{@creature nothic}助手。",
	"{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT} makes it clear that he wants things black and white. He is sick and tired of all the \"color and variety in Harmony.\" {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT} wants to destroy the well and return things the \"good old days when things were less...colorful.\" He's grown weary of {@creature Emo|NRH-AT}'s \"lack of a spine\" and would gladly sacrifice the beholder if would mean destroying the well.": "{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}明确表示，他希望事情是黑白的。他厌倦了所有 \"和谐中的色彩和多样性\"。{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}想毁掉这口井，让事情回到 \"美好的过去，当事情不那么......多彩的时候\"。他已经厌倦了(2%)的 \"缺乏脊梁骨\"，如果这意味着摧毁这口井，他将很乐意牺牲看客。",
	"If {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT} sees the {@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}, he knows that it's his ticket to a colorless world and does everything in his power to get it—whether it's offering the party 2000 gp or threatening to give them all a thrashing they won't soon forget. {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT} is partial to the latter.": "如果{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}看到了{@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}，他知道这是他通往无色世界的门票，并尽其所能地得到它--无论是提供给聚会的2000金币，还是威胁要给他们所有人一个他们不会很快忘记的痛击。{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}偏向于后者。",
	"{@creature Emo|NRH-AT} is a beholder that has studied the joy-inducing effects of the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT} and came to the plane of Harmony to cure its melancholy. {@creature Emo|NRH-AT} believes that if they can absorb all the magical colors, then somehow their sadness will be cured, and they can live happily ever after. They don't care about Harmony and its citizens because they are very self-absorbed.": "{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}是一个研究了{@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT}的快乐诱导效果的观察者，来到和谐平面，以治疗其忧郁。{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}相信，如果他们能吸收所有的神奇色彩，那么他们的忧郁就会以某种方式被治愈，并能从此过上幸福的生活。他们不关心和谐星球和它的公民，因为他们非常自我陶醉。",
	"If {@creature Emo|NRH-AT} is offered kindness and friendship—such as a home within the flumph cloister—they are willing to change their plan. Convincing {@creature Emo|NRH-AT} to give up their apparatus and try another way to find happiness requires a successful DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. If GuBu is present, or the characters offer {@creature Emo|NRH-AT} a home within the flumph cloister, the check is made with advantage.": "如果{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}被提供善意和友谊--比如在弗隆夫回廊内的一个家--他们就愿意改变他们的计划。说服{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}放弃他们的仪器并尝试另一种方式来寻找幸福，需要成功地进行DC14魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查。如果GuBu在场，或者人物提供{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}一个在flumph cloister内的家，那么该检查是有优势的。",
	"If the adventurers succeed in defeating {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT} and undoing {@creature Emo|NRH-AT}'s plan to absorb the colors of Harmony, they can use the {@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT} to restore the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT} (see \"Opening the Box\" above). If they do this, the colors of the well are dazzling as they shoot upward through the ceiling of the cavern, which glows and hums with the power of the colors.": "如果冒险家们成功地打败了{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}，并解除了{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}吸收和谐之色的计划，他们就可以用{@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}来恢复{@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT}（见上文 \"打开盒子\"）。如果他们这样做了，井里的颜色就会令人眼花缭乱，它们会向上射穿洞穴的天花板，而洞穴则会因颜色的力量而发光和嗡嗡作响。",
	"If the adventurers convince {@creature Emo|NRH-AT} to join the flumph cloister, GuBu listens to {@creature Emo|NRH-AT}'s story of being an oddball and feeling left out, and welcomes {@creature Emo|NRH-AT} into their cloister. All the flumphs turn bright shades of yellow and green, their color restored. They thank the party telepathically in a delightful chorus of gratitude.": "如果冒险家们说服{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}加入弗隆夫回廊，古布就会听{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}讲述自己是个怪人，感到被抛弃，并欢迎{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}进入他们的回廊。所有人都变成了明亮的黄色和绿色，他们的颜色恢复了。他们以心灵感应的方式感谢党，发出令人愉快的感激之声。",
	"If Furzle runs off during the encounter at the well, the characters may decide to track down the nothic to prevent it from causing more trouble. You can deal with this any way you'd like. One way is to have the party catch up with Furzle trying to cross the chasm in area M4. Although he has a treacherous streak, if treated with kindness, Furzle could make a great wizard's assistant. Perhaps if guided under the strong hand of Headmaster Gustava, Furzle could become a valuable asset.": "如果Furzle在井边的遭遇战中跑掉了，角色们可以决定追踪nothic以防止它造成更多麻烦。你可以用你喜欢的任何方式来处理这个问题。一种方法是让他们在M4区追上试图穿越鸿沟的Furzle。虽然他有奸诈的倾向，但如果善待他，Furzle可以成为一个伟大的巫师助手。也许如果在校长古斯塔瓦的有力指导下，福尔兹勒可以成为一个有价值的资产。",
	"With the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT} restored to full power, the magic of Harmony returns, and the city is once again vibrant with color. When the characters return to the city, they are lauded as heroes at an awards ceremony where Gustava the Great pins medals on them, giving them the highest honor of Prism Academy—the Order of Zimandius. The mayor then gives each of them a key to the city of Harmony and Mr. Honeycutt is there to return the {@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT} to the Lorekeeper Society. Mr. Honeycutt officially writes each of them into the Lorekeeper Society's ledgers as honorary members of the sect and sworn protectors of Harmony.": "随着{@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT}能量的恢复，和谐的魔力又回来了，城市又一次充满了活力的色彩。当这些人物回到城市时，他们在一个颁奖仪式上被称赞为英雄，古斯塔瓦大帝给他们戴上了勋章，给予他们棱镜学院的最高荣誉--Zimandius勋章。然后，市长给了他们每个人一把和谐城的钥匙，霍尼卡特先生在那里把{@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}的钥匙交还给了罗列者协会。霍尼卡特先生正式将他们每个人都写进了守望者协会的账簿，成为该教派的荣誉成员和和谐城的宣誓保护者。",
	"If the adventurers fail, {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT} either uses the {@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT} to destroy the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT} or has {@creature Emo|NRH-AT} figure out a way to suck all the color from the well, resulting in a black and white world devoid of joy and wonder.": "如果冒险者失败了，{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}要么用{@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}来摧毁{@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT}，要么让{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}想办法从井里吸走所有的颜色，导致一个没有欢乐和奇迹的黑白世界。",
