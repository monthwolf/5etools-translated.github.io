	"Ever jealous of the cheery dispositions and colorful deliciousness of the NERDS, Emo the beholder and his hired muscle, Mr. Greystone, have struck a blow against the NERDS' beloved city of Harmony. After years of searching, the nefarious duo have found the sacred Prismatic Well that gives Harmony its vibrant and fabulous colors. Now, with access to the Prismatic Well, Emo and Mr. Greystone have begun to leech the color from the city of Harmony. If they aren't stopped, the city will gradually turn gray, with everything eventually becoming black and white.": "Emo和他的雇佣兵Greystone先生一直嫉妒NERDS的快乐性格和多彩的美味，他们对NERDS所热爱的城市Harmony进行了打击。经过多年的搜寻，这对邪恶的二人组已经找到了神圣的棱镜井，它赋予了和谐城鲜艳而美妙的色彩。现在，有了进入棱镜井的机会，埃莫和格雷斯通先生开始从和谐城中吸取颜色。如果不阻止他们，这个城市将逐渐变成灰色，所有东西最终都会变成黑色和白色。",
	"To the NERDS, the colors beginning to flicker and drain out of Harmony is an unsettling mystery. What brings the colors to Harmony is an enigma to them. All they can do is hope the power comes back on and restores the vibrancy of Harmony's colors once more. But one group knows what's up, and that group is the Lorekeeper Society—a secret society sworn to protect Harmony. The Lorekeepers know about the power of the Prismatic Well, but its true location is lost even to themselves. However, they have a way to find the well using an ancient artifact known as the Amulet of Harmony, but to activate it they need to find the six Gems of Power. Once activated, the amulet guides whoever controls it to the secret location of the Prismatic Well. But once activated, the amulet also has the power to turn off the well.": "对于NERDS来说，颜色开始闪烁并从Harmony中流失是一个令人不安的谜。是什么给和谐号带来了色彩，对他们来说是个谜。他们所能做的就是希望电力恢复，再次恢复和谐号的色彩活力。但有一个团体知道这是怎么回事，这个团体就是传说守护者协会--一个发誓要保护和谐的秘密团体。传说守护者知道棱镜井的力量，但它的真实位置连他们自己都不知道。然而，他们有办法通过一个被称为 \"和谐护身符 \"的古老神器来找到这口井，但要激活它，他们需要找到六颗力量宝石。一旦激活，护身符会引导控制它的人到达棱镜井的秘密地点。但一旦激活，护身符也有能力关闭水井。",
	"The Gems of Power were long ago hidden away for safekeeping in dungeons, forests, and towers. No one in the Lorekeeper Society knows the details of the magical beasts and traps guarding the gems, but our heroic NERDS are more than up to the challenge of restoring Harmony!": "力量宝石很久以前就被藏在地牢、森林和塔楼里保管起来了。守望者协会中没有人知道守护宝石的魔兽和陷阱的细节，但我们英勇的NERDS足以应对恢复和谐的挑战!",
	"Due to the solo player nature of the adventures (with the exception of Adventure 7 Adventure Together), the power level of some monsters may be difficult with respect to the level of the character. You may want to present a roleplaying solution (such as making friends with the monster or tricking them) to players who are eager to rush into combat. With any encounter in this or subsequent adventures, feel free to present opportunities for unconventional solutions and alternatives to combat.": "由于冒险的单人性质（《冒险7》《一起冒险》除外），一些怪物的力量等级可能与角色的等级有一定的差距。你可能想向那些急于投入战斗的玩家提出一个角色扮演的解决方案（如与怪物交朋友或欺骗它们）。在这次或以后的冒险中遇到的任何情况，都可以自由地提出非常规的解决方案和战斗的替代方案的机会。",
	"You can also adjust the story to be more benevolent in nature, allowing automatic successes on rolls, having monsters become instant friends, or giving your player advantage on all their rolls.": "你也可以把故事调整得更仁慈一些，允许卷轴自动成功，让怪物立即成为朋友，或者让你的玩家在所有的卷轴上获得优势。",
	"In the case of an untimely death, you can have a helpful NPC (like Mr. Honeycutt) save the day and revive them, or you can have them forego death saving throws and wake up as they're being dragged someplace unpleasant.": "如果是过早死亡，你可以让一个有帮助的NPC（如Honeycutt先生）拯救他们并使他们复活，或者你可以让他们放弃死亡储蓄，在他们被拖到不愉快的地方时醒来。",

	"The adventure begins with Purple deep in thought at the School of Evocation in Prism Academy. Lately, researchers at the academy have been hard at work attempting to discover what could be behind the color outages plaguing Harmony, and Purple's mentor has them working overtime to find any clue as to the cause of this mysterious dulling of Harmony. Many theories abound, and each school of magic claims they have working hypotheses, but no one has anything concrete.": "冒险开始时，紫在棱镜学院的唤起学院里陷入了深思。最近，学院的研究人员一直在努力工作，试图发现困扰和谐的颜色中断背后的原因，而紫的导师让他们加班加点，寻找任何关于和谐的神秘暗淡原因的线索。许多理论比比皆是，每个魔法学校都声称他们有可行的假说，但没有人有具体的东西。",
	"When you're ready to start play, read or paraphrase the following:": "当你准备开始游戏时，阅读或转述以下内容。",
	"You are in your study, poring over old books about the magical history of Harmony's vibrant color, trying to find an explanation for it fading away, when a beautiful butterfly alights on your windowsill. It looks at you with sparkling eyes and says, \"Go to the statue of Filomena the Wise.\" Then it disappears into twinkling motes of light.": "你在你的书房里，翻阅关于和谐色彩的神奇历史的旧书，试图为它的消逝找到解释，这时一只美丽的蝴蝶在你的窗台上停了下来。它用闪亮的眼睛看着你，说：\"去菲洛米娜贤者的雕像那里。\" 然后它消失在闪烁的光斑中。",
	"Purple knows this statue. Filomena the Wise was one of the founding wizards of the Prism Academy. The 8-foot-tall statue of Filomena is in a quiet, wooded glade within the campus, about a five-minute walk away from Purple's study.": "紫色知道这个雕像。智者菲洛梅娜是棱镜学院的创始巫师之一。这座8英尺高的菲洛梅娜雕像位于校园内一个安静的林间小道，离紫的书房大约有5分钟的步行路程。",
	"A dapper gentleman in a suit with horn-rimmed glasses is waiting for Purple at the statue. The man motions for Purple to come and sit on a bench. The man is {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}, the Magister of the Lorekeeper Society. He begs for Purple's understanding for complete secrecy as he unrolls a {@item spell scroll} of {@spell silence} and casts the spell. Mr. Honeycutt previously imbibed a potion of {@spell telepathy}, and he then speaks the following in Purple's head:": "一位穿着西装、戴着角质眼镜的潇洒绅士正在雕像前等着紫色。那人示意紫罗兰过来坐在长椅上。这个人是{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}，是罗列者协会的法师。他恳求紫的理解，让他完全保密，同时他展开了一个{@item spell scroll}的{@spell silence}，并施展了咒语。霍尼卡特先生之前吸食了{@spell telepathy}的药水，然后他在紫的脑海中说出了以下的话。",

You may not have heard of us, but we have been watching you—and right now, we desperately need your help.": "请原谅我的预防措施，但总有一些人在听。我的名字是Honeycutt先生，我属于Lorekeeper协会。你可能没有听说过我们，但我们一直在关注你--现在，我们迫切需要你的帮助。",
	"Mr. Honeycutt explains that he needs to find the Violet Gem, a magic stone that he says can help the Lorekeeper Society find the cause of these color outages. He has come to Purple to ask for their help in unlocking the mystery. Honeycutt reaches into his leather satchel and pulls out a piece of polished amber inscribed with runes. Mr. Honeycutt says that this piece of amber is the key to finding the Violet Gem, but no one in the Lorekeeper Society knows how to decipher it. If Purple helps decipher the amber stone and recover the Violet Gem, the Lorekeepers and all Harmony would be forever in Purple's debt. Mr. Honeycutt is also willing to throw in a pouch of 25 gold pieces for the trouble.": "霍尼卡特先生解释说，他需要找到紫罗兰宝石，他说这是一块神奇的石头，可以帮助罗瑞金协会找到这些颜色中断的原因。他来到紫罗兰，请求他们帮助揭开这个谜团。霍尼卡特将手伸进他的皮挎包，拿出一块刻有符文的抛光琥珀。霍尼卡特先生说，这块琥珀是找到紫罗兰宝石的关键，但守望者协会中没有人知道如何破译它。如果紫帮助破译这块琥珀石并找回紫罗兰宝石，守望者协会和所有的和谐协会将永远欠紫的人情。哈尼卡特先生也愿意扔下一袋25个金币来换取麻烦。",
	"Mr. Honeycutt asks Purple to leave a note for him at the tavern when they find the Gem, and he'll meet them back at the statue of Filomena the Wise within the hour.": "霍尼卡特先生要求紫罗兰在找到宝石后在酒馆给他留一张纸条，他将在一小时内与他们在智者菲洛米娜的雕像前见面。",
	"The piece of amber is an ancient key that unlocks a secret door in Herald's Crypt—a famous tomb underneath the academy. This {@item amber runestone|NRH-TLT} is also a magic item that Purple can attune to by spending a short rest focused on only on the item while in physical contact with it. See the end of the adventure for its game statistics.": "这块琥珀是一把古老的钥匙，可以打开先驱者墓穴中的一扇秘密之门--学院下面的一个著名的坟墓。这个{@item amber runestone|NRH-TLT}也是一个魔法物品，紫可以通过在与它的身体接触时花一个短暂的休息时间只专注于这个物品来调整它。关于它的游戏统计，请看冒险的结尾。",
	"Once translated, the runes on the amber say two things. One is a series of numbers: 12, 2, 6, 9, 24, and 36. The other runes are a poem:": "一旦翻译出来，琥珀上的符文说的是两件事。一个是一系列的数字。12，2，6，9，24，和36。另一个符文是一首诗。",
	"Attune the stone to light the way. At Herald's Crypt one kneels to pray, Turn my skull then bow your head, Lest you who seek now join the dead. Once in my tomb, my name speak thrice, A gift of sunlight is the price.": "调整石头，照亮道路。在先驱者的墓穴，人们跪下来祈祷，转动我的头骨，然后低下头，以免你现在寻找的人加入到死亡的行列。一旦进入我的墓穴，我的名字就会说三遍，阳光的礼物就是代价。",
	"Purple has heard of Herald's Crypt—a special place, strictly off-limits to students, where the headmasters of Prism Academy are buried. Students have seen the iron door (known as the Flower Door for all the intricately carved flowers in it) that leads to the crypt during school meetings in the Great Hall.": "紫色听说过先驱者的墓穴--一个特殊的地方，严格禁止学生进入，棱镜学院的校长们都埋在那里。学生们在大礼堂举行的学校会议上见过通往墓室的铁门（因其上雕刻着复杂的花朵而被称为花门）。",
	"The entrance to Herald's Crypt is the massive Flower Door that is off to the side of the Great Hall within Prism Academy. There are two main ways to open the door:": "赫拉德墓穴的入口是巨大的花门，位于棱镜学院内大礼堂的一侧。有两个主要的方法来打开这扇门。",
	"Convince Headmaster Gustava (Lawful good, human, {@creature archmage}) to allow Purple to open the Flower Door and enter the crypt. Purple must make a successful DC 17 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) or—with a more wizardly argument—a successful DC 17 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check to convince the headmaster.": "说服校长古斯塔瓦（合法善良，人类，{@creature archmage}）允许紫罗兰打开花门，进入墓室。紫色必须成功地进行DC17魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）或--如果有更多的巫师论证--成功地进行DC17智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查来说服校长。",
	"Sneak in using the {@item amber runestone|NRH-TLT}. If Purple attunes to the stone, they can shine sunlight on the Flower Door. Doing this reveals a series of glowing numerals, 1–50, that are in the center of each of the flowers on the door. Pressing the numerals in the sequence written on the stone (12, 2, 6, 9, 24, and 36) opens the magic lock. An incorrect sequence sets off an alarm that summons Headmaster Gustava, who appears instantly.": "使用{@item amber runestone|NRH-TLT}偷偷地溜进去。如果紫罗兰与石头相合，他们可以用阳光照射花门。这样做可以看到一系列发光的数字，1-50，这些数字在门上每朵花的中央。按照石头上写的顺序（12、2、6、9、24和36）按下数字，就可以打开魔法锁。不正确的顺序会触发警报，召唤出校长古斯塔瓦，他立即出现。",
	"If your player comes up with another clever way to get into the crypt, run with it!": "如果你的玩家想出了另一个进入地窖的聪明方法，那就用它来做吧!",
	"Once the door is opened, Purple sees a set of stone stairs that descend 30 feet into darkness.": "门一打开，紫衣就看到一组石阶，下到30英尺的黑暗中。",
	"The following locations are keyed to the map included with this adventure.": "以下地点是与本探险所附的地图相对应的。",
	"The stone stairs lead to a corridor that ends at a locked iron door. The door has AC 15, 100 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.": "石阶通向一条走廊，走廊的尽头是一扇上锁的铁门。这扇门有15点攻击力，100点命中率，对毒药和精神伤害有免疫力。",
	"On the door is inscribed a riddle:": "门上刻有一个谜语。",
	"Dust a hand cannot clean, A button a hand cannot push, A cog a hand cannot freeze.": "手不能打扫的灰尘，手不能推动的按钮，手不能冻结的齿轮。",
	"Purple notices a perfect square of what looks like dirt on the door. It can't be cleaned by hand, only with a {@spell prestidigitation} spell.": "紫色注意到门上有一个看起来像污垢的完美方形。它不能用手清理，只能用{@spell prestidigitation}的法术。",
	"When the dirt is cleaned off, it reveals a small button. Again, the button can't be pushed except by a {@spell mage hand} spell.": "当污垢被清理掉后，会露出一个小按钮。同样，除了用{@spell mage hand}的法术，这个按钮不能被按下。",
	"When the button is pushed, it turns into a cog that begins turning. It can only be stopped by targeting it with the {@spell ray of frost} spell.": "当按钮被按下时，它变成了一个开始转动的齿轮。只有用{@spell ray of frost}法术瞄准它，才能停止它。",
	"When the cog is frozen, the door unlocks with an audible click. A carved mouth appears on the door and says, \"Enter.\"": "当齿轮被冻住时，门就会以可听到的咔嚓声解锁。门上出现一个雕刻的嘴巴，说：\"进入\"。",
	"If your player gets too frustrated with the riddle, the mouth can appear early and give Purple some hints.": "如果你的玩家对这个谜语太过沮丧，嘴巴可以提前出现，给紫色一些提示。",
	"This stone room is a sacred place that honors the headmasters of Prism Academy. The walls of this 50-foot-long hall are lined with alcoves, each one holding the tomb of a former headmaster. The crypt is well maintained; the brass fittings are polished and the floors are freshly mopped.": "这个石室是纪念棱镜学院校长的圣地。这个50英尺长的大厅的墙壁上有很多凹槽，每个凹槽里都有一位前校长的坟墓。墓室维护得很好；黄铜配件被擦得锃亮，地板也是刚拖过的。",
	"When Purple enters, read or paraphrase the following:": "当紫色进入时，阅读或转述以下内容。",
	"You've heard a lot about this place in your time at Prism Academy. Herald's Crypt is a sacred place that is venerated by all the faculty. You see the tombs of the former headmasters in alcoves along the walls, and flowers and notes of appreciation are laid before the tombs in silent reverence. You've also heard that the tombs are warded with powerful magic—anyone attempting to defile them would face certain death.": "你在棱镜学院的时候，已经听说了很多关于这个地方的事情。先知的墓穴是一个神圣的地方，受到所有教员的敬仰。你看到沿墙的凹槽里有前任校长的坟墓，鲜花和感谢信被放在坟墓前，充满了无声的敬畏。你还听说，这些坟墓被强大的魔法守护着--任何试图玷污它们的人都将面临死亡。",
	"Even though the tombs are tempting, they are not meant for Purple to loot. Purple has heard stories told around Prism Academy that the tombs are protected by deadly spells cast by high-level archmages. Some faculty members say that the whole crypt is a dangerous booby trap and that's why it is strictly off-limits.": "尽管这些坟墓很诱人，但它们并不适合紫罗兰去掠夺。紫听到在棱镜学院周围流传的故事，说这些墓穴受到高级大法师施展的致命法术的保护。一些教员说，整个墓室是一个危险的诱杀装置，这就是为什么它被严格禁止进入的原因。",
	"Despite this warning, your player may want to forego social decency and try to plunder the tombs. If this happens, let the tomb defend itself—which will most likely result in Purple's spectacular death (see \"TPK: Total Party Kill,\" above).": "尽管有这样的警告，你的玩家可能想放弃社会礼节，试图掠夺这些坟墓。如果发生这种情况，让古墓为自己辩护--这很可能会导致紫的壮观死亡（见上文的 \"TPK：党派完全死亡\"）。",
	"Each crypt is engraved with the name of the deceased, and ornately carved and decorated with coats of arms and other heraldry significant to that headmaster.": "每个墓室都刻有死者的名字，并华丽地雕刻和装饰有盾牌和其他对该校长有意义的纹章。",

To detect the wards, Purple must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check or cast detect magic.": "每个地窖都被封上了防护的石刻，只有校长古斯塔瓦知道解除石刻的密码。要探测到这些防护装置，紫衣必须在DC17智力({@skill Investigation})检查中成功，或者施展探测魔法。",
	"Trying to break into a tomb triggers the glyph. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners.

A creature takes 45 ({@damage 10d8}) thunder damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "试图闯入坟墓的行为会触发石刻。触发后，石刻会在以石刻为中心的20英尺半径的范围内爆发出魔法能量。该球体在角落里扩散。该区域内的每个生物都必须做一个DC17的灵巧蓄力动作。蓄力失败时，生物会受到45({@damage 10d8})的雷霆伤害，蓄力成功时则受到一半的伤害。",

	"The runes carved on the amber stone (see \"Deciphering the Runes,\" above) instruct Purple to kneel and bow their head after turning the skull to one side. Doing so causes a bolt of lightning to shoot over the top of Purple's head, opening a secret door to area H3.": "刻在琥珀石上的符文（见上文 \"破译符文\"）指示紫罗兰在将头骨转到一边后跪下并低头。这样做会使一道闪电从紫的头顶射过，打开通往H3区的秘密大门。",
	"If Purple kneels and turns the skull but doesn't bow their head, a lightning bolt lashes out towards Purple in a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide.

	"Purple must make the swap quickly; one round after the Violet Gem is removed, the door to the room is sealed by a heavy block of stone, and the stone hands on top of the sarcophagus begin blindly searching for the amber runestone. As soon as either the Violet Gem or the amber stone is put into the wizard's hands, the block of stone disappears and the room opens.": "紫罗兰必须迅速进行交换；在紫罗兰宝石被取出后的一个回合，房间的门被一块沉重的石块封住，石棺上面的石手开始盲目地寻找琥珀色的符文石。只要紫罗兰宝石或琥珀石被放到巫师的手中，石块就会消失，房间就会打开。",
