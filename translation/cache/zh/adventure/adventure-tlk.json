	"to say this is a loosely constructed adventure may be an exaggeration of some degree. However, some patron saint of children requested a pdf of my adventure notes. So, here we are. I've use one version or another of this adventure to introduce people to the D&D experience as it has all the elements of a good game with very little ramp up time needed. The adventure structure is created in such a way to allow for as much or as little combat is desired. Encounters can be changed to suit a lvl1 campaign, and with a little imagination I imagine one could have fun altering it for a party in the high teens. Some nice paintings of Ancient Dragons and Neoliths may be in order.": "说这是一个结构松散的冒险，可能在某种程度上是夸大了。然而，一些儿童的守护神要求获得我的冒险笔记的PDF。所以，我们来了。我曾用这个冒险的一个或另一个版本来向人们介绍D&D的经验，因为它具有一个好游戏的所有元素，只需要很少的准备时间。这个冒险的结构是以这样一种方式创建的，即允许有或多或少的战斗需要。遇到的情况可以改变，以适应lvl1的活动，而且只要有一点想象力，我想就可以为十几岁的人改变它的乐趣。一些漂亮的古龙和新石器的绘画可能是有必要的。",

A shelf filled with organs in jars. One of the shelves is a fomorian eye that will curse anyone it sees with the \"Evil Eye\" (the description of the Evil Eye can be found in the {@creature fomorian} entry in the Monster Manual).": "一个全石头的房间，中间有一个排水口。墙上挂着各种尸体，他们的皮肤被剥开，露出肌肉、器官和骨骼。每个都被细致地标记。每个尸体的头顶上有一个小圆洞。尸体包括：一个蛮族熊人，一个地精，一个男性人类，和一个掌控者。男性人类还在滴血。一个架子上摆满了装在罐子里的器官。其中一架上有一个福莫里亚之眼，它会用“邪眼”咒诅看到它的任何人（“邪眼”的描述可在《怪物手册》中的{@creature fomorian}条目中找到）。",
	"A small room with a lectern in the center. Three locked glass cases line the walls, each filled with books and various items. On the back wall is a painting of the Study Library with everything identical to what the players see, except a Kenku, Cawkrin Jones, is depicted crouched down in front of one of the glass cases. The doorway to the room is magical. Any item taken through the door way will trigger the spell {@spell Alarm}.": "一个小房间，中间放着一个讲台。墙边有三个上锁的玻璃展柜，里面摆满了书籍和各种物品。后墙挂着一幅画，描绘了研究图书馆的景象，与玩家所见完全相同，只是画中有一只肯库（Kenku），名叫考克林·琼斯（Cawkrin Jones），蹲在其中一个玻璃展柜前。房间的门口是魔法的。任何穿过门口带走的物品都会触发法术{@spell Alarm}。"
