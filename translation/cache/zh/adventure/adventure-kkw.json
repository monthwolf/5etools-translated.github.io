	"\"{@creature Krenko|KKW}'s Way\" is a short adventure for a party of four to six 1st-level adventurers, who might advance to 2nd level by the adventure's conclusion. It is set in the Tenth District of Ravnica and serves as an introductory adventure to the setting. A balance of character classes is helpful, since the adventurers will face a variety of challenges. Adventurers can be affiliated with any of the guilds.": "\"{@creature Krenko|KKW}之路 \"是一个简短的冒险，适合4至6名1级冒险者，他们在冒险结束时可能会提升到2级。它的背景是拉夫尼卡的第十区，可以作为该设定的入门冒险。角色等级的平衡是有帮助的，因为冒险者们将面临各种挑战。冒险者可以隶属于任何一个行会。",
	"{@creature Krenko|KKW} is the boss of a notorious goblin mob, and he has made his fortune and built his reputation by mostly staying out of the guilds' way. He has managed to cause no end of trouble for the citizens of the Tenth District, but not without attracting the attention of the guilds. A cunning opportunist, {@creature Krenko|KKW} has spent years consolidating goblin street rabble into his fiercely loyal gang. He cultivated connections among the ruthless and powerful, specializing in high-value theft and mayhem. At the apex of his influence, he got into a nasty turf war with the Shattergang Brothers, a rival goblin gang that often deals in illicit arms. Rumors swirled that {@creature Krenko|KKW} killed Dargig, the youngest of the three brothers, after a weapons drop went bad.": "{@creature Krenko|KKW}是一个臭名昭著的地精暴徒的老板，他主要是通过远离行会的方式发家致富并建立自己的声誉。他设法给第十区的市民带来了无穷的麻烦，但也不免引起了各大公会的注意。作为一个狡猾的机会主义者，(1%)多年来一直在巩固地精街头的乌合之众，使之成为他忠诚的团伙。他在无情和强大的人中培养关系，专门从事高价值的盗窃和破坏活动。在他的影响力达到顶点时，他与破碎岗兄弟（Shattergang Brothers）陷入了一场恶劣的地盘战争，这是一个经常从事非法武器交易的敌对地精团伙。有传言说，(2%)在一次武器投放失败后，杀死了三兄弟中最年轻的达吉。",
	"The remaining two brothers, Rikkig and Gardagig, attempted to kill {@creature Krenko|KKW} in retaliation for the death of their kin. Before they could do the deed, {@creature Krenko|KKW} was apprehended by the Boros Legion and thrown into Sawtooth Prison—near the legion's headquarters of Sunhome—to spend the rest of his life behind bars. But someone as well connected as {@creature Krenko|KKW} has ways of shortening his own sentence.": "剩下的两个兄弟，里基格和加达基格，试图杀死{@creature Krenko|KKW}以报复他们的亲属的死亡。在他们动手之前，(1%)被博罗军团逮捕，并被扔进锯齿监狱--靠近军团总部Sunhom--在监狱里度过他的余生。但像{@creature Krenko|KKW}这样有关系的人有办法缩短自己的刑期。",
	"Inciting a riot in prison secured him a transfer to Udzec, a maximum-security facility in Precinct Two of the Tenth District, administered by the Azorius Senate. During the transfer, agents of a former associate of {@creature Krenko|KKW}'s created a distraction, and he was able to slip away to rendezvous with his gang. He now plots his next move as he reestablishes power over his criminal enterprise.": "在监狱里煽动暴乱，使他被转移到乌泽克，一个位于第十区第二选区的最高安全设施，由阿佐里乌斯参议院管理。在转移过程中，{@creature Krenko|KKW}的一个前同伙的特工制造了一个分心，他得以溜走，与他的团伙会合。现在他正在策划下一步行动，因为他要重新建立对其犯罪企业的权力。",
	"{@creature Krenko|KKW}'s escape is no small matter.

During the adventure, the Shattergang Brothers catch wind of {@creature Krenko|KKW}'s freedom, and are desperate to make him pay.": "{@creature Krenko|KKW}的逃跑不是一件小事。行会商会也参与其中，因为他们担心另一场地精帮派战争可能会威胁到行会之间脆弱的和平。在冒险过程中，碎石帮兄弟得知了(1%)的自由，并不顾一切地要让他付出代价。",
	"Not every villain in a Ravnica campaign is a member of a guild, and not every scheme originates in the guildhalls. As you build your own adventures in Ravnica, you can use the suggestions in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} for creating villains to craft a guildless villain, one who prefers the independence of operating outside the guild structure or even seeks to undermine that structure entirely. More often than not, though, the guilds turn out to be involved in the schemes of even minor villains.": "在拉夫尼卡的战役中，并非每个反派都是公会成员，也并非每个计划都源自公会。当你在拉夫尼卡建立自己的冒险时，你可以使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中关于创建反派的建议来制作一个无公会的反派，一个喜欢在公会结构之外独立行动，甚至试图完全破坏这种结构的人。不过，更多时候，公会会被证明参与了甚至是小反派的计划。",

If the stat block appears elsewhere, the adventure's text tells you so.": "{@book Monster Manual|MM}包含了这个冒险中发现的许多生物的统计数据。当一个生物的名字以{@b bold}的字体出现时，那是一个视觉提示，告诉你在{@book Monster Manual|MM}中该生物的统计块。如果状态块出现在其他地方，冒险故事的文字会告诉你。",
	"The adventure begins at Sawtooth Prison as the party is summoned by Nassius Ven, an official from the Chamber of the Guildpact. He explains that {@creature Krenko|KKW} has escaped during a prison transfer, and it's urgent that the characters locate him and bring him back to justice as soon as possible and with discretion.": "冒险开始于锯齿监狱，一行人被公会商会的官员Nassius Ven召见。他解释说，{@creature Krenko|KKW}在一次监狱转移过程中逃跑了，当务之急是人物要找到他，并尽快谨慎地将他带回法庭。",
	"Eventually, the adventurers find {@creature Krenko|KKW}'s hideout: a warehouse near a canal. A final showdown with the goblin mob boss, his retinue, and possible Shattergang interlopers ensues. Then it's merely a matter of delivering {@creature Krenko|KKW} back to Nassius before more trouble breaks out.": "最终，冒险者们找到了{@creature Krenko|KKW}的藏身之处：一个靠近运河的仓库。随之而来的是与哥布林黑帮老大、他的随从以及可能的破碎岗插手者的最后摊牌。然后，在更多的麻烦发生之前，只需要把(1%)送回纳西乌斯。",

	"{@b Izzet}. A pair of armored mages descended from the sky on hovering discs. They aimed devices attached to their arms at the guards and blasted them back with a concussive wave. While the guards were recovering, the mages magically dissolved {@creature Krenko|KKW}'s bonds and he escaped.": "{@b Izzet}. 一对装甲法师乘着盘旋的圆盘从天而降。他们把连接在手臂上的装置对准守卫，用震荡波把他们轰回去。当守卫正在恢复的时候，法师们用魔法溶解了{@creature Krenko|KKW}的束缚，他逃了出来。",

	"Once the players are ready to begin, read or paraphrase the following introductory text:": "一旦玩家准备好开始，请阅读或转述以下介绍性文字。",
	"Life in the Tenth District is never dull. A hub of constant activity, it always offers a new opportunity, a new challenge, a new intrigue. It is a place where a promising adventurer like you can find your path to glory, riches, or power through your allegiance to your guild. But first you'll need a job that will help you prove your worth.": "第十区的生活从不乏味。作为一个不断活动的中心，它总是提供一个新的机会，一个新的挑战，一个新的阴谋。在这里，像你这样有前途的冒险家可以通过对公会的忠诚找到通往荣耀、财富或权力的道路。但首先你需要一份能帮助你证明自己价值的工作。",

	"Have the players introduce their characters to each other, if they aren't acquainted already.

Once the characters have had a chance to get to know one another, read:": "如果他们还不熟悉的话，让玩家们互相介绍自己的角色。这也可能是一个让角色确定或发现可能将他们联系起来的个人联系的时机，例如共同的熟人或联系人、共同的背景，或住在同一个社区。一旦这些人物有机会相互认识，就读。",
	"Light rain begins to patter on the cobblestones as the sun sets behind the spires and towers of the city. You see a male vedalken in well-tailored clothes approach your group from around the side of the prison. His deep blue face bears a gentle but concerned expression. He raises his hand to hail you and speaks in a low tone as his eyes take in your group and the nearby environs. \"Are you here to help us find something?\"": "当太阳从城市的尖顶和塔楼后面落下时，鹅卵石上开始下起了小雨。你看到一个穿戴整齐的男性维达尔肯人从监狱的一侧走过来。他深蓝色的脸上带着温和而关切的表情。他举起手来招呼你们，并以低沉的语气说话，他的眼睛打量着你们一行人和附近的环境。\"你是来帮我们找东西的吗？\"",
	"After receiving affirmative answers from the party, Nassius hands the characters a dossier from Sawtooth Prison with an image of a smug, tough-looking male goblin on it. Nassius offers up the following information, which can be conveyed through conversation with him:": "在得到当事人的肯定回答后，纳西乌斯交给人物一份来自锯齿监狱的档案，上面有一个自鸣得意、面目狰狞的男性妖精形象。纳修斯提供了以下信息，可以通过与他的对话来传达。",

	"\"{@creature Krenko|KKW} has made a lot of enemies, but the Shattergang Brothers are his biggest threat. They're a rival goblin gang specializing in illicit weapons, and they want {@creature Krenko|KKW} dead in reprisal for the murder of one of their lieutenants. The dead lieutenant also happens to be the youngest of the three siblings that run the gang. They'll tear apart the neighborhood to find him once they know he has escaped.\"": "\"{@creature Krenko|KKW}已经树了很多敌人，但碎石帮兄弟是他最大的威胁。他们是一个敌对的地精团伙，专门生产非法武器，他们希望(1%)死掉，以报复他们的一个副手被杀。死去的中尉也恰好是掌管该团伙的三兄弟中最年轻的一个。一旦他们知道他逃跑了，就会把附近的居民拆开来找他。\"",
	"\"Normally, we'd let the Azorius deal with this situation, but we suspect that {@creature Krenko|KKW} might have had help from one of the other guilds when he escaped.

	"If he is asked, Nassius provides the guards' account of the circumstances of his escape (see \"{@creature Krenko|KKW}'s Patron\").

	"Once Nassius has departed, the characters can get to work. They can conduct their investigation however they choose, but time is of the essence since eventually word on the street gets back to the Shattergang Brothers and they start another turf war to flush {@creature Krenko|KKW} out.": "一旦纳修斯离开，人物就可以开始工作了。他们可以随心所欲地进行调查，但时间是最重要的，因为街上的消息最终会传到碎石帮兄弟那里，他们又开始了一场地盘争夺战，要把{@creature Krenko|KKW}冲出去。",
