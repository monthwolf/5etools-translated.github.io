It is set in the Tenth District of Ravnica and serves as an introductory adventure to the setting. A balance of character classes is helpful, since the adventurers will face a variety of challenges. Adventurers can be affiliated with any of the guilds.": "\"{@creature Krenko|KKW}之路 \"是一个简短的冒险，适合4至6名1级冒险者，他们在冒险结束时可能会提升到2级。它的背景是拉夫尼卡的第十区，可以作为该设定的入门冒险。角色等级的平衡是有帮助的，因为冒险者们将面临各种挑战。冒险者可以隶属于任何一个行会。",
	"Inciting a riot in prison secured him a transfer to Udzec, a maximum-security facility in Precinct Two of the Tenth District, administered by the Azorius Senate.

	"Not every villain in a Ravnica campaign is a member of a guild, and not every scheme originates in the guildhalls. As you build your own adventures in Ravnica, you can use the suggestions in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} for creating villains to craft a guildless villain, one who prefers the independence of operating outside the guild structure or even seeks to undermine that structure entirely. More often than not, though, the guilds turn out to be involved in the schemes of even minor villains.": "在拉夫尼卡的战役中，并非每个反派都是公会成员，也并非每个计划都源自公会。当你在拉夫尼卡建立自己的冒险时，你可以使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中关于创建反派的建议来制作一个无公会的反派，一个喜欢在公会结构之外独立行动，甚至试图完全破坏这种结构的人。不过，更多时候，公会会被证明参与了甚至是小反派的计划。",

If the stat block appears elsewhere, the adventure's text tells you so.": "{@book Monster Manual|MM}包含了这个冒险中发现的许多生物的统计数据。当一个生物的名字以{@b bold}的字体出现时，那是一个视觉提示，告诉你在{@book Monster Manual|MM}中该生物的统计块。如果状态块出现在其他地方，冒险故事的文字会告诉你。",
	"The adventure begins at Sawtooth Prison as the party is summoned by Nassius Ven, an official from the Chamber of the Guildpact.

	"{@b Izzet}. A pair of armored mages descended from the sky on hovering discs. They aimed devices attached to their arms at the guards and blasted them back with a concussive wave. While the guards were recovering, the mages magically dissolved {@creature Krenko|KKW}'s bonds and he escaped.": "{@b Izzet}. 一对装甲法师乘着盘旋的圆盘从天而降。他们把连接在手臂上的装置对准守卫，用震荡波把他们轰回去。当守卫正在恢复的时候，法师们用魔法溶解了{@creature Krenko|KKW}的束缚，他逃了出来。",

	"Have the players introduce their characters to each other, if they aren't acquainted already.

	"After receiving affirmative answers from the party, Nassius hands the characters a dossier from Sawtooth Prison with an image of a smug, tough-looking male goblin on it. Nassius offers up the following information, which can be conveyed through conversation with him:": "在得到当事人的肯定回答后，纳西乌斯交给人物一份来自锯齿监狱的档案，上面有一个自鸣得意、面目狰狞的男性妖精形象。纳修斯提供了以下信息，可以通过与他的对话来传达。",

	"If he is asked, Nassius provides the guards' account of the circumstances of his escape (see \"{@creature Krenko|KKW}'s Patron\").
