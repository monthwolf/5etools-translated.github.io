	"Welcome to Restoring Harmony, a Dungeons & Dragons adventure series in collaboration with the tasty and colorful world of NERDS.": "欢迎来到《恢复和谐》，这是《龙与地下城》的冒险系列，与美味和多彩的NERDS世界合作。",
	"To run this adventure, you need the fifth edition Basic Rules for D&D, which is available as a free download here. All the magic items and monster stat blocks you need are included at the end of this adventure.": "要运行这个冒险，你需要第五版D&D基本规则，可以在这里免费下载。你所需要的所有魔法物品和怪物状态块都包含在这个冒险的最后。",
	"Restoring Harmony is a campaign that's divided into six 1st-level mini adventures for a solo player and one longer adventure for multiple players. Each mini adventure takes approximately 45 minutes to play and the final adventure takes approximately 60–90 minutes to play.": "恢复和谐》是一个活动，分为6个适合单人游戏的一级迷你冒险和一个适合多人游戏的较长的冒险。每个迷你冒险大约需要45分钟，最后的冒险大约需要60-90分钟。",

	"Ever jealous of the cheery dispositions and colorful deliciousness of the NERDS, Emo the beholder and his hired muscle, Mr. Greystone, have struck a blow against the NERDS' beloved city of Harmony. After years of searching, the nefarious duo have found the sacred Prismatic Well that gives Harmony its vibrant and fabulous colors. Now, with access to the Prismatic Well, Emo and Mr. Greystone have begun to leech the color from the city of Harmony. If they aren't stopped, the city will gradually turn gray, with everything eventually becoming black and white.": "Emo和他的雇佣兵Greystone先生一直嫉妒NERDS的快乐性格和多彩的美味，他们对NERDS所热爱的城市Harmony进行了打击。经过多年的搜寻，这对邪恶的二人组已经找到了神圣的棱镜井，它赋予了和谐城鲜艳而美妙的色彩。现在，有了进入棱镜井的机会，埃莫和格雷斯通先生开始从和谐城中吸取颜色。如果不阻止他们，这个城市将逐渐变成灰色，所有东西最终都会变成黑色和白色。",
	"To the NERDS, the colors beginning to flicker and drain out of Harmony is an unsettling mystery. What brings the colors to Harmony is an enigma to them. All they can do is hope the power comes back on and restores the vibrancy of Harmony's colors once more. But one group knows what's up, and that group is the Lorekeeper Society—a secret society sworn to protect Harmony. The Lorekeepers know about the power of the Prismatic Well, but its true location is lost even to themselves. However, they have a way to find the well using an ancient artifact known as the Amulet of Harmony, but to activate it they need to find the six Gems of Power. Once activated, the amulet guides whoever controls it to the secret location of the Prismatic Well. But once activated, the amulet also has the power to turn off the well.": "对于NERDS来说，颜色开始闪烁并从Harmony中流失是一个令人不安的谜。是什么给和谐号带来了色彩，对他们来说是个谜。他们所能做的就是希望电力恢复，再次恢复和谐号的色彩活力。但有一个团体知道这是怎么回事，这个团体就是传说守护者协会--一个发誓要保护和谐的秘密团体。传说守护者知道棱镜井的力量，但它的真实位置连他们自己都不知道。然而，他们有办法通过一个被称为 \"和谐护身符 \"的古老神器来找到这口井，但要激活它，他们需要找到六颗力量宝石。一旦激活，护身符会引导控制它的人到达棱镜井的秘密地点。但一旦激活，护身符也有能力关闭水井。",
	"The Gems of Power were long ago hidden away for safekeeping in dungeons, forests, and towers. No one in the Lorekeeper Society knows the details of the magical beasts and traps guarding the gems, but our heroic NERDS are more than up to the challenge of restoring Harmony!": "力量宝石很久以前就被藏在地牢、森林和塔楼里保管起来了。守望者协会中没有人知道守护宝石的魔兽和陷阱的细节，但我们英勇的NERDS足以应对恢复和谐的挑战!",
	"Due to the solo player nature of the adventures (with the exception of Adventure 7 Adventure Together), the power level of some monsters may be difficult with respect to the level of the character. You may want to present a roleplaying solution (such as making friends with the monster or tricking them) to players who are eager to rush into combat. With any encounter in this or subsequent adventures, feel free to present opportunities for unconventional solutions and alternatives to combat.": "由于冒险的单人性质（《冒险7》《一起冒险》除外），一些怪物的力量等级可能与角色的等级有一定的差距。你可能想向那些急于投入战斗的玩家提出一个角色扮演的解决方案（如与怪物交朋友或欺骗它们）。在这次或以后的冒险中遇到的任何情况，都可以自由地提出非常规的解决方案和战斗的替代方案的机会。",
	"You can also adjust the story to be more benevolent in nature, allowing automatic successes on rolls, having monsters become instant friends, or giving your player advantage on all their rolls.": "你也可以把故事调整得更仁慈一些，允许卷轴自动成功，让怪物立即成为朋友，或者让你的玩家在所有的卷轴上获得优势。",
	"In the case of an untimely death, you can have a helpful NPC (like Mr. Honeycutt) save the day and revive them, or you can have them forego death saving throws and wake up as they're being dragged someplace unpleasant.": "在意外死亡的情况下，你可以让一个有帮助的NPC（如Honeycutt先生）拯救他们并使他们复活，或者你可以让他们放弃死亡储蓄，在他们被拖到某个不愉快的地方时醒过来。",
	"Here is a quick overview of the adventure:": "以下是对这次冒险的简要概述。",

They're trying to discover who or what is causing the \"color outages.\" Elowen has a map to find a magic gem that'll help them in their quest.": "埃洛温告诉瑞德，她是一个被称为 \"传说守护者 \"的秘密社团的成员。他们正试图发现是谁或什么造成了 \"颜色中断\"。Elowen有一张地图，可以找到一颗魔法宝石，帮助他们完成任务。",

	"Hand the character sheet (see \"Red the Ranger,\" below) to your player and let them familiarize themselves with Red.": "把人物表（见下面的 \"游侠红\"）交给你的玩家，让他们熟悉红。",
	"All creatures or NPCs that are bolded have stat blocks, which are included at the end of the adventure along with any magic items the characters can earn. Whenever you're both ready, you can start the session.": "所有加粗的生物或NPC都有状态块，这些状态块和角色可以获得的任何魔法物品一起包含在冒险结束时。只要你们都准备好了，就可以开始会议了。",
	"At the start of this adventure, Red the ranger is in their natural element—exploring the forest. Read the following:": "在这次冒险的开始，护林员小红正处于他们的自然状态--探索森林。阅读以下内容。",
	"You're in the forests on the outskirts of the city of Harmony, investigating what the locals are calling \"color outages\" occurring across the city. The forest is usually filled with lush colors from the plants and wildlife that fill the area, but you've found the strange color outages dulling the city have struck here too—fading the flowers and graying the leaves.": "你在和谐城郊区的森林里，调查当地人所说的发生在整个城市的 \"颜色中断\"。森林里的植物和野生动物通常都充满了郁郁葱葱的色彩，但你发现使城市变得黯淡无光的奇怪断色现象也出现在这里--花朵褪色，树叶变灰。",
	"Entrusted with protecting and preserving the forest, you've been searching for natural causes that might be behind the outages, but have had no luck so far determining the source. As you hunt for more clues, a little bird lands next to you with a tiny scrap of parchment in its beak.": "你被委托保护和保存森林，你一直在寻找可能是停电背后的自然原因，但到目前为止还没有运气确定来源。在你寻找更多的线索时，一只小鸟落在你身边，嘴里叼着一张小小的羊皮纸。",
	"If Red makes a successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Animal Handling}) check, the bird flies over and drops the parchment into their hand and then flies away. If Red holds out their finger as a perch or offers the bird some tasty seeds, they have advantage on the check. If Red opens the note, read:": "如果红方成功地进行了DC12智慧({@skill Animal Handling})检查，这只鸟就会飞过来，把羊皮纸丢到他们手里，然后飞走。如果红方伸出他们的手指作为栖息地，或者给鸟儿提供一些美味的种子，他们在检查中就有优势。如果红方打开纸条，读。",
	"Noble ranger, please help us solve the mystery of the color outages. I've sent my Sapling Scout, Elowen Greenleaf, to wait for you in the Old Oak Grove. She knows who you are and awaits your aid. Make haste, she may already be in danger.": "高贵的护林员，请帮助我们解开断色之谜。我已经派我的小树苗童子军埃洛温-格林里夫在老橡树林里等你。她知道你是谁，并等待着你的帮助。抓紧时间，她可能已经处于危险之中。",
	"Red knows Mr. Honeycutt to be a kindly, soft-spoken librarian at the Harmony Library.": "Red知道Honeycutt先生是哈莫尼图书馆的一位和蔼可亲、说话温和的图书管理员。",
	"Red dashes through the forest and finds the Old Oak Grove. As Red enters the grove, read the following:": "小红冲过森林，找到了老橡树林。当红军进入小树林时，阅读以下内容。",
	"You enter a grove of ancient trees. One in particular you know well, the Old Oak. Its thick, gnarled branches twist up into the sky and birds chirp in its gently creaking boughs. Near the Old Oak, a small sapling with a tiny face looks around as if expecting someone.": "你进入一片古树林。其中有一棵你很熟悉，那就是老橡树。它粗壮的树枝扭曲着伸向天空，鸟儿在它轻轻吱吱作响的枝桠上鸣叫着。在老橡树附近，一棵长着小脸的小树苗四处张望，好像在等人。",
	"If Red goes to investigate, the sapling, a young {@creature awakened shrub}, introduces herself as Elowen Greenleaf. She knows all about Red the Ranger and recommended Red to Mr. Honeycutt to help unravel and solve the mystery of the color outages.": "如果瑞德去调查，那个小树苗，一个年轻的{@creature awakened shrub}，自我介绍说是艾洛文-格林里夫。她知道游侠Red的一切，并向Honeycutt先生推荐了Red，让他帮助揭开和解决颜色断裂的谜团。",
	"Elowen Greenleaf is dressed in a Sapling Scout uniform that includes a green sash with stitched-on badges. She's precocious and eager to earn merit badges by being a helpful member of the forest community—but she's also secretly a member of the Lorekeeper Society.": "埃洛温-格林里夫身穿小树苗童子军制服，其中包括一条缝有徽章的绿色腰带。她很早熟，渴望通过成为森林社区的一个有用的成员来获得功绩勋章--但她也是秘密地成为罗列者协会的成员。",
	"She tells Red she's involved in a matter of great importance: Mr. Honeycutt has entrusted her with a mission to find the Crimson Gem, one of the six Gems of Power. But there's a problem, and it's why they need the help of a ranger. The gem is guarded by the legendary Scarlet Sentinel, and no one knows how to get past it. All Elowen has to go on is a tattered map.": "她告诉瑞德她卷入了一件非常重要的事情。哈尼卡特先生委托她去寻找深红宝石，这是六颗力量宝石之一。但是有一个问题，这就是他们需要游侠帮助的原因。宝石由传说中的猩红哨兵守护着，没有人知道如何通过它。艾罗文只能依靠一张破烂的地图。",
	"Elowen has a pair of binoculars, a compass, a box of Sapling Scout wafers, and a sewing kit.": "埃洛温有一副望远镜，一个指南针，一盒小树苗童子军的威化饼干，还有一个针线包。",

	"The Scarlet Sentinel is an ancient statue that the Lorekeeper Society magically enchanted long ago to guard the Crimson Gem. But how to deactivate it has long since been lost.": "猩红哨兵是一尊古老的雕像，很久以前，罗列者协会用魔法使其守护深红宝石。但如何解除它的功能，早已失传。",
	"Some bad guys are also looking for the Crimson Gem and Mr. Honeycutt believes they're the ones responsible for the recent color outages. She doesn't know who they are though.": "一些坏人也在寻找深红宝石，Honeycutt先生认为他们就是对最近的断色事件负责的人。但她不知道他们是谁。",
	"She has a tattered map (see \"Elowen's Map,\" below) from the Lorekeeper Society library, but she doesn't recognize the location the map refers to.": "她有一张破旧的地图（见下面的 \"埃洛温地图\"），来自守望者协会图书馆，但她不认识地图所指的地点。",
	"Elowen entreats Red to help her find the Crimson Gem and sweetly offers to embroider a Sapling Scout merit badge for them as a reward.": "Elowen恳求Red帮助她找到深红宝石，并甜蜜地提出为他们绣制一个小树苗童子军的功绩勋章作为奖励。",
	"If Red agrees to help the Lorekeeper Society, Elowen shows Red the tattered parchment map. The map illustrates the rough location of what could be a cave mouth or doorway.": "如果瑞德同意帮助守望者协会，艾罗文就会给瑞德看那张破烂的羊皮纸地图。该地图说明了可能是洞口或门洞的大致位置。",
	"Red also recognizes the unique shape of the trees depicted on the map as belonging to the lemondrop tree. Red thinks the most likely location is Lemondrop Ledges—a place deep in the wilderness that Red has heard about, but never explored. Some say that, long ago, temples were carved into the cliffs, and Red has often wondered if the rumors were true.": "瑞德还认出了地图上所描绘的树木的独特形状，认为它们属于雷蒙德罗树。Red认为最可能的地点是Lemondrop Ledges--一个在荒野深处的地方，Red听说过，但从未探索过。有人说，很久以前，寺庙被刻在悬崖上，Red经常想知道这些传言是否是真的。",
	"Also, some cryptic glyphs are drawn next to the doorway on the map:": "另外，在地图上的门洞旁边还画有一些隐秘的石刻。",
	"The glyphs represent the three plants that must be touched in the correct order to open the magic door at the entrance to the temple (see area R1, below). The plants are foxglove, spider plant, and catspaw, respectively.": "这些石刻代表三种植物，必须按照正确的顺序触摸它们才能打开神庙入口处的魔法门（见下文R1区）。这些植物分别是狐狸草、蜘蛛草和猫爪草。",
	"Red dashes through the forest taking a wrong turn here and there. Finally, as Red nears the grove, read the following:": "红军在森林里冲来冲去，在这里和那里转错了弯。最后，当Red接近小树林时，读到以下内容。",
	"As you enter the Old Oak Grove, you hear a cry of alarm and what sounds like arrows whistling through the air. Near the Old Oak, you see a small sapling with a tiny, {@condition frightened} face flanked by two gnarled thorn bushes that look threatening.": "当你进入老橡树林的时候，你听到一声惊呼，听起来像是箭在空中呼啸。在老橡树附近，你看到一棵小树苗，它的脸很小，{@condition frightened}，两边是两棵虬曲的荆棘丛，看起来很有威胁。",
	"A successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check reveals that the thorn bushes are two {@creature twig blight||twig blights}, while the {@condition frightened} sapling wearing a green sash with stitched-on badges is an {@creature awakened shrub}, Elowen Greenleaf.": "成功通过DC10智力({@skill Nature})检查，可以发现荆棘丛是两棵{@creature twig blight||twig blights}，而穿着缝有徽章的绿色腰带的{@condition frightened}小树苗是一棵{@creature awakened shrub}，艾罗文绿叶。",
	"The {@creature twig blight||twig blights} have orders from the shadowy Mr. Greystone to find the Scarlet Sentinel and retrieve the Crimson Gem. For what purpose, they don't know, but what they do know is that bringing Elowen Greenleaf back to their master is a good first step to finding the gem.": "阴暗的格雷斯通先生命令{@creature twig blight||twig blights}找到猩红哨兵并取回深红宝石。为了什么目的，他们不知道，但他们知道的是，把艾罗文-格林里夫带回他们的主人身边是找到宝石的良好第一步。",
	"Should all go successfully, after the conflict, have Red and Elowen meet (see \"Meeting Elowen,\" above).": "如果一切顺利，在冲突结束后，让瑞德和艾罗文见面（见上文 \"与艾罗文见面\"）。",
	"To find Lemondrop Ledges, Red must succeed on three consecutive DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) checks. If Red uses Elowen's map, they have advantage on the checks. If a check fails, Elowen can assist by rolling herself, but as she hasn't completed her Sapling Scout orienteering course yet, she doesn't have advantage on her roll.": "要找到莱蒙卓尔，红方必须连续三次成功地进行DC12智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查。如果Red使用Elowen的地图，他们在检查中具有优势。如果检查失败，艾罗文可以通过自己的滚动来协助，但由于她还没有完成她的小树苗童子军定向越野课程，她在滚动中没有优势。",
	"Eventually, they begin to smell the scent of fresh lemons as they reach the top of a bluff covered by lemondrop trees. Sheer cliffs fall 100 feet from the bluff into the ravine below.": "最后，他们开始闻到新鲜柠檬的香味，因为他们到达了被柠檬树覆盖的悬崖顶部。陡峭的悬崖从悬崖上落下100英尺，进入下面的峡谷。",
	"These deciduous fruiting trees have silvery bark, distinctive spiky, green leaves, and clusters of small, lemon-sweet fruit. Birds, bees, and other forest animals love these fruits as it gives them a boost of energy. Eating three or more fruits grants Red the benefits of an enhance ability (bear's endurance) spell (no concentration required).": "这些落叶果树有银色的树皮，独特的尖顶绿叶，以及一簇簇柠檬味的小果实。鸟类、蜜蜂和其他森林动物都喜欢这些果实，因为它能给它们带来能量。吃下三个或更多的果实，可以使小红获得增强能力（熊的耐力）法术的好处（不需要集中注意力）。",
	"The entrance to the Temple of the Scarlet Sentinel is in the cliff face across the ravine from Lemondrop Ledges and requires a successful DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to spot. If Elowen or Red remember to use the binoculars Elowen has in her Sapling Scout pack, they have advantage on the check. If the check fails, they still find the entrance, but two twig blights sneak up on them and attack while they're busy looking for it.": "猩红哨兵神庙的入口就在莱蒙卓尔峡谷对面的崖壁上，需要成功通过DC14智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查才能发现。如果伊洛文或瑞德记得使用伊洛文在她的小树苗童子军背包里的望远镜，他们在检查中就有优势。如果检定失败，他们仍然能找到入口，但有两个树枝枯萎症患者在他们忙于寻找的时候悄悄靠近他们并进行攻击。",
	"Getting to the entrance means climbing down the 100-foot cliff into the ravine, crossing the ravine, then climbing halfway up the other side. However, to the north, a precarious-looking rope bridge crosses the ravine, should the adventurers choose that path.": "到入口处意味着要从100英尺高的悬崖上爬下，进入峡谷，穿过峡谷，然后从另一边爬到一半。然而，在北边，如果冒险者选择这条道路，有一座看起来很危险的绳桥横跨峡谷。",
	"Crossing the base of the ravine poses no difficulty to Red.": "穿过峡谷的底部对红军来说没有任何困难。",
	"The 250-foot-long rope bridge has wood planks to walk on. Some of the planks are missing or look worse for wear. Some frayed suspension ropes dangle from the main lines where the wood planks have given way. Overall, the bridge looks worn and weather-beaten, but feels as if it'll still take some weight.": "这座250英尺长的绳索桥有木板可以行走。一些木板已经丢失，或者看起来更加破旧。一些磨损的悬挂绳索从木板让路的主线上垂下。总的来说，这座桥看起来很破旧，饱经风霜，但感觉它仍然可以承受一些重量。",
	"A rope bridge is a great place to throw in some peril for your player to deal with. You can have a horde of needle blights chase them so they have to cross the bridge, or you can have needle blights harass them as they're halfway across. Feel free to invent fun complications for your player as they navigate across it—nothing creates more tension than the rope bridge being sawed through as your heroes run for their lives, or when the heroes must cut the ropes as a bunch of needle blights scramble across after them!": "绳索桥是一个很好的地方，可以让你的玩家处理一些危险的事情。你可以让一群针刺虫追赶他们，让他们不得不过桥，也可以让针刺虫在他们走到一半时骚扰他们。你可以在玩家过桥的过程中自由地发明一些有趣的复杂情况--没有什么比绳索桥在你的英雄们逃命时被锯断，或者当英雄们必须在一群针虫追赶他们的时候砍断绳索更紧张的了。",
	"The Temple of the Scarlet Sentinel was carved into the cliff long ago as a secret place to house and guard the Crimson Gem.": "猩红哨兵神庙很久以前就被刻在悬崖上，作为存放和保护深红宝石的秘密场所。",
	"The following locations are keyed to the Temple of the Scarlet Sentinel map:": "以下地点是以血色哨兵神庙的地图为关键。",
	"Whichever way Red gets to the entrance, they finally arrive at a thin ledge on the cliff face 50 feet off the ground. The doorway to the temple is a bas-relief archway carved into the cliff. The bas-relief comprises leaves, flowers, and plants of all different varieties.": "无论红军从哪条路走到入口处，他们终于来到了离地面50英尺的悬崖峭壁上的一个薄壁架。寺庙的门口是一个刻在悬崖上的浮雕拱门。浮雕由各种不同种类的叶子、花朵和植物组成。",
	"If Red makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check, they find carved into the door the same three species of plant depicted on the map: foxglove, spider plant, and catspaw.": "如果瑞德成功地进行了DC12智力({@skill Nature})检查，他们会发现在门上刻有与地图上描述的相同的三种植物：狐狸草、蜘蛛草和猫爪草。",
	"Pressing them in that order triggers the door's magic. Glowing lines emerge around the archway as a seam forms in the solid stone, then stone grinds on stone as the door swings open.": "按这个顺序按下去，就会触发门的魔法。拱门周围出现了发光的线条，在坚固的石头上形成了一条缝，然后随着门的打开，石头在石头上磨擦。",
	"If the player struggles to solve the puzzle, have Elowen give Red a vital clue that puts them on the right track.": "如果玩家在解谜过程中遇到困难，可以让埃洛温给雷德一条重要的线索，让他们走上正轨。",
	"When Red enters the passageway, read the following:": "当红军进入通道时，阅读以下内容。",
	"The air smells dank and stale as you look into a dark tunnel that leads into the cliff. Colorful pictograms on the either side of the tunnel show a variety of scenes: happy NERDS frolicking beside a well from which a rainbow of colors pours forth; the city of Harmony being built; an amulet that has six colorful gemstones in it; and a scene of a great library being built.": "当你看向一条通向悬崖的黑暗隧道时，空气中弥漫着潮湿和恶臭。隧道两边的彩色象形图显示了各种场景：快乐的NERDS在一口井旁嬉戏，从井里涌出了五颜六色的彩虹；正在建造的和谐城；一个装有六颗彩色宝石的护身符；以及一个正在建造的巨大图书馆的场景。",
	"Coming from a room at the far end of the tunnel, Red can see a faint, reddish glow.": "从隧道远端的一个房间里出来，瑞德可以看到一个微弱的红色光亮。",
	"As Red approaches the entrance to this circular, 75-foot-diameter room with a 20-foot-high domed ceiling, read the following:": "当瑞德走到这个圆形的、直径75英尺的房间的入口处，有一个20英尺高的圆顶天花板时，请阅读以下内容。",
	"In the center of the room, you see a faintly glowing red gemstone hovering above a 12-foot-tall statue of a warrior that sits atop a stone dais. The gemstone's glow dimly lights the room. On the floor, a large red circle etched with strange sigils surrounds the statue and extends across most of the room, leaving only a 5-foot wide path around the edge of the circular chamber. As if sensing your presence, the statue's eyes snap open and glow red.": "在房间的中央，你看到一颗微弱的红色宝石在一个12英尺高的战士雕像上方盘旋，这个雕像坐在一个石台上。宝石的光芒昏暗地照亮了整个房间。在地板上，一个刻有奇怪符号的大红圈围绕着雕像，并延伸到房间的大部分，只留下一条5英尺宽的路径，围绕着圆形房间的边缘。仿佛感觉到了你的存在，雕像的眼睛猛然睁开，发出红色的光芒。",
	"On a raised dais in the center of the room stands the Scarlet Sentinel. It's made from blood onyx and depicts a strange, humanlike creature with elongated arms and fangs that jut from its wide mouth. Any creature that moves into the red circle painted on the floor, even if they cross the boundary without touching the floor, activates the sentinel, which instantly attacks the nearest living thing. As soon as there's nothing alive within the circle, the sentinel returns to the dais and goes dormant—except for its ominously glowing eyes.": "在房间中央的高台上，矗立着 \"血色哨兵\"。它由血色玛瑙制成，描绘了一个奇怪的、类似人类的生物，有修长的手臂和从其宽大的嘴里伸出的獠牙。任何生物只要进入画在地板上的红圈，即使它们越过边界而不接触地板，也会激活哨兵，它将立即攻击最近的活物。一旦圈内没有任何生物，哨兵就会回到台子上，进入休眠状态--除了它那双不祥的眼睛。",
	"The gem is magically levitating 17 feet off the ground (5 feet above the sentinel's head). There are many ways Red can go about getting the gem. Here are two methods:": "宝石神奇地悬浮在离地17英尺的地方（在哨兵的头上5英尺）。红方有许多方法可以获得宝石。以下是两种方法。",
	"Red can shoot the hovering gem with an arrow to knock it beyond the red circle. The gem has AC 18, 3 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Red must put a pad over the arrow tip, otherwise Red risks shattering the gem. If Red hits the gem with a regular arrow, have the player roll damage. If Red deals the gem 4 or more damage, then the gem breaks and Elowen howls in despair. The gem can ultimately be fixed if the pieces are taken back to {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}, but he panics when he first sees the gem, before remembering he knows a wizard who can help him restore it. Hitting the gem with a padded arrow knocks the gem toward the edge. Have the player roll a {@dice d6}. On a 1–4 the gem flies outside the red circle, on a 5 or 6, the gem falls inside the circle where Red can hit it again.": "红方可以用箭射击盘旋的宝石，把它打到红圈之外。宝石有AC18，3点命中率，对毒药和精神伤害有免疫力。红方必须在箭尖上放一个垫子，否则红方有可能打碎宝石。如果红方用普通的箭射中宝石，让玩家掷出伤害。如果红方对宝石造成4个或更多的伤害，那么宝石就会碎裂，Elowen会绝望地嚎叫。如果把宝石的碎片取回{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}，宝石最终是可以修复的，但他在第一次看到宝石时惊慌失措，然后才想起他认识一个巫师，可以帮他修复。用垫子箭打宝石，把宝石打向边缘。让玩家掷出{@dice d6}。1-4时，宝石飞到红圈外，5或6时，宝石落到红圈内，红可以再次击中它。",
	"Red and Elowen can work together with one of them luring the sentinel away while the other grabs the gem with a net or a long pole. This requires quick and flawless execution as one hit from the sentinel can spell certain death.": "瑞德和伊洛文可以一起工作，其中一人将哨兵引开，另一人用网或长杆抓取宝石。这需要快速和完美的执行，因为哨兵的一击就意味着死亡。",
	"If all goes well, Elowen and Red get the gem and head back toward Harmony, where Elowen excitedly wants to introduce her new hero Red to Mr. Honeycutt. You can have them meet in the Old Oak Grove or in a tavern or library within Harmony.": "如果一切顺利，Elowen和Red得到了宝石，然后回到Harmony，在那里Elowen兴奋地想把她的新英雄Red介绍给Honeycutt先生。你可以让他们在老橡树林或在哈莫尼的一个酒馆或图书馆见面。",
	"Mr. Honeycutt is overjoyed at the return of the Crimson Gem (unless it's in pieces) and wants to know everything about the adventure while he scribbles copious notes in his black notebook.": "哈尼卡特先生对深红宝石的回归欣喜若狂（除非它是碎片），并想知道关于这次冒险的一切，同时他在他的黑色笔记本上写下了大量的笔记。",
	"Elowen also gives Red a newly stitched merit badge for acts of heroism and bravery.": "埃洛温还给了雷德一个新缝制的功勋章，以表彰其英雄主义和勇敢的行为。",
	"The following magic items appear in this adventure.": "下列魔法物品出现在这次冒险中。",
	"In solo play, there's always a chance the character can die. In the case of a single adventurer, this death results in the end of play; which isn't optimal for an afternoon of fun! One way to avoid death is to have healing readily available to the adventurer. If they're without healing, have the character find the odd {@item potion of healing} lying in a dusty crate or have them discover a special healing plant on their journey that, if eaten, puts them back to full hit points.": "在单人游戏中，角色总是有可能死亡。对于单个冒险者，死亡会导致游戏结束；这对一个愉快的下午并不理想！避免死亡的一种方法是让冒险者随时获得治疗。如果他们没有治疗，可以让角色在一个灰尘箱子里发现一个奇怪的{@item potion of healing}，或者在旅途中发现一种特殊的治疗植物，如果食用，可以让他们恢复到满血状态。",
	"Red also knows where Old Oak Grove is. With a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check, Red remembers how to get there in under 15 minutes and arrives before Elowen is ambushed (see \"Arriving Before the Ambush,\" below). On a failed check, it takes Red 25 minutes to get there and they arrive while Elowen is being ambushed (see \"Arriving During the Ambush,\" below).": "Red也知道老橡树林在哪里。通过成功的DC 12智力检定({@skill Nature})，Red记得如何在15分钟内到达那里，并在Elowen被伏击之前到达（见下文的“在伏击之前到达”）。如果检定失败，Red需要25分钟才能到达那里，他们会在Elowen被伏击时到达（见下文的“在伏击期间到达”）。",
	"Red can deal with the twig blights in a number of ways. Trying to intimidate or persuade them is difficult and Red must make a successful DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation} or {@skill Persuasion}) check to change their minds.": "Red可以用多种方式处理树枝模样的枯枝怪。试图恐吓或说服它们是困难的，Red必须进行一次成功的DC 15魅力检定({@skill Intimidation} or {@skill Persuasion})来改变它们的想法。",
	"If Red chooses to help Elowen, they set off for Lemondrop Ledges, which is a two-hour hike from the Old Oak Grove. As they travel, Red notices the color outages extend into the wilderness. Even the animals are noticeably duller, and some are now just tones of gray. Red also notices a {@creature chimeric fox|NRH-AVitW} that seems to be following them. The fox is inquisitive and maybe even a bit nosey, but it's skittish and isn't fond of loud noises. If Red is kind to the fox, it tags along for the rest of the adventure and helps the party as best it can—by barking if there's danger or by distracting a dangerous foe.": "如果Red选择帮助Elowen，他们就会启程前往Lemondrop Ledges，这里距离Old Oak Grove有两个小时的徒步路程。当他们旅行时，Red注意到色彩的消失延伸到了荒野中。甚至动物们也变得明显暗淡，有些现在甚至只是灰色的色调。Red还注意到有一个{@creature chimeric fox|NRH-AVitW}似乎在跟踪着他们。这只狐狸很好奇，甚至有点爱管闲事，但它很胆小，不喜欢大声的噪音。如果Red对这只狐狸友善，它会一直跟随着冒险队伍，并尽其所能帮助队伍——当有危险时会吠叫，或者分散危险的敌人注意力。",
	"This is also a good place to have Red discover some healing plants that Red (or Elowen) can brew into a {@item potion of healing}. Finding the healing plants requires a successful DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check, or you can have Red automatically find the plants and brew the potion.": "这也是一个好地方，让瑞德发现一些治疗植物，可以由瑞德（或艾洛文）熬成{@item potion of healing}。要找到这些治疗植物，需要进行一次成功的DC 14智力检定({@skill Nature})，或者你可以让瑞德自动找到这些植物并熬制药水。",
	"Whether Red is climbing up the cliff or rappelling down it, they must make a DC 12 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check for every 15 feet of movement (rounded up). Using climbing gear or anchoring themselves to a tree with a rope gives them advantage on the check. If the check fails, and the character isn't anchored to a tree by a rope, any falling character takes 3 ({@damage 1d6}) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet fall.": "无论是Red正在攀岩上山还是正在绳降下山，他们每移动15英尺（向上取整）都必须进行一次 DC 12 力量检定（{@skill Athletics}）。使用攀岩装备或者用绳子将自己固定在树上可以让他们在检定时获得优势。如果检定失败，并且角色没有用绳子将自己固定在树上，任何坠落的角色每下落10英尺会受到3 ({@damage 1d6}) 的钝击伤害。",
	"For their troubles, he awards Elowen with a shiny badge of merit for outstanding service and promotes her to Sapling Scout First Class. To Red, he gives a pouch containing 20 gp and invites Red to join the Lorekeeper Society. If Red accepts, Mr. Honeycutt gives Red a magic cloak pin with the emblem of the Lorekeeper Society on it. The Lorekeeper pin acts as a {@item necklace of adaptation}.": "为了表彰她的辛勤劳动，他授予艾洛雯一枚闪亮的优秀服务徽章，并将她晋升为一级幼苗侦察员。对于瑞德，他给了一个装有20 gp的小袋，并邀请瑞德加入博学者协会。如果瑞德接受，霍尼卡特先生会给他一枚带有博学者协会徽章的魔法披风别针。博学者别针的作用是{@item necklace of adaptation}。",
