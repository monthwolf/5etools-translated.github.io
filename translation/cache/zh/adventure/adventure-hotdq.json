	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} tells an epic story spanning two adventures, {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} and {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}—the two tales contained within this collection. Both adventures are introduced here, outlining their backgrounds, plots, and fundamental ties, followed by details on allies and villains relevant to both adventures. Regardless of which adventure you're running, this overview provides useful information, applicable to the wider campaign and helpful for foreshadowing the threats unleashed by the Cult of the Dragon.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}讲述了一个跨越两个冒险的史诗故事，即{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}和{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}--这套书中的两个故事。这里介绍了两个冒险，概述了它们的背景、情节和基本联系，然后是与两个冒险有关的盟友和反派的细节。无论你在进行哪一个冒险，这个概述都提供了有用的信息，适用于更广泛的战役，并有助于预示龙之教所释放的威胁。",
	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} is set in the Forgotten Realms on Faerûn's western shore—the Sword Coast. A thin strip of civilization stretches down this coast, where widely spaced cities are arranged like beads on a string. Roads loosely connect the cities that stretch from Luskan in the north to Calimport in the south, passing through Neverwinter, Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, and other ports along the way. The bulk of this adventure takes place on the stretch between Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的背景是被遗忘的领域，在Faerûn的西海岸--剑海岸。一条细长的文明带沿着这个海岸线延伸，那里的城市像串珠子一样排列着。道路松散地连接着从北部的卢斯坎到南部的卡林波特的城市，沿途经过永夜城、水底城、博德之门和其他港口。这次冒险的主要内容发生在博德之门和永夜之间的路段。",
	"You can play this adventure with just the Dungeons & Dragons basic rules and the {@i Tyranny of Dragons} appendix online, which contains all the monsters and magic items not described in this book. Both of these supplements are available as free downloads on {@link DungeonsandDragons.com|https://dnd.wizards.com}.": "你可以只用《龙与地下城》的基本规则和网上的{@i Tyranny of Dragons}附录来玩这个冒险，其中包含了本书中没有描述的所有怪物和魔法物品。这两个附录都可以在{@link DungeonsandDragons.com|https://dnd.wizards.com}上免费下载。",
	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} tells an epic story across two adventures, of which {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} is the first. Characters begin this adventure at 1st level; by the end of it they should be 7th or 8th level and ready to continue with {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}. The ideal party size is four characters. If your group is larger or smaller, you can adjust the adventure's difficulty by adjusting the number of enemies in each encounter.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}通过两个冒险讲述了一个史诗般的故事，其中{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}是第一个。角色从1级开始冒险；在冒险结束时，他们应该是7级或8级，并准备好继续进行{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}。理想的队伍规模是四个角色。如果你的队伍人数较多或较少，你可以通过调整每个遭遇中的敌人数量来调整冒险的难度。",
	"At your option, you can use the milestone experience rule. Under this rule, you pick events in the campaign that cause the characters to level up. In {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}, the characters gain a level after completing each chapter except chapter 5.": "根据你的选择，你可以使用里程碑式的经验规则。在这个规则下，你在战役中挑选事件，使角色的等级提高。在{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}中，人物在完成每一章后都会获得一个等级，第五章除外。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon has been active in Faerûn for centuries. It has focused on making undead dragons to fulfill a prophecy most of that time, but that's changing.": "龙的崇拜在法鲁恩已经活跃了几个世纪。在那段时间里，它一直专注于制造不死龙来实现一个预言，但这正在改变。",
	"The new leader of the cult is a Calishite named Severin Silrajin, who believes that real draconic knowledge and power belongs to living dragons, not undead ones.": "邪教的新领袖是一个名叫塞弗林-西拉金的卡利希特人，他认为真正的龙族知识和力量属于活龙，而不是不死之身。",
	"Severin's ambition amused Tiamat, so she revealed the existence of five dragon masks to him—one for each chromatic dragon color. Individually, these ancient masks allow wearers to communicate with dragons. More importantly, a person who is erudite in draconic lore becomes a wyrmspeaker while wearing the mask, which allows the wearer to think like a dragon, gain favor among dragons, and subtly influence their behavior. When all five are brought together, they magically merge into a single Mask of the Dragon Queen. With the assembled mask, the cult can release Tiamat from her prison in the Nine Hells.": "塞弗林的野心让提亚马特很高兴，所以她向他透露了五个龙形面具的存在--一个代表每种色泽的龙。单独来看，这些古老的面具允许佩戴者与龙交流。更重要的是，一个精通龙族传说的人在戴上面具后会成为一个巫师，这让佩戴者能够像龙一样思考，在龙族中获得青睐，并巧妙地影响它们的行为。当所有五个人被聚集在一起时，他们会神奇地合并成一个龙后的面具。有了组合起来的面具，邪教可以将提亚马特从她在九层地狱的监狱中释放出来。",
	"After Severin (subtly guided by Tiamat) discovered that secret, he bent all the cult's resources to finding the long-lost dragon masks in their secret hiding places. When he recovered the red mask, Severin became the first of the wyrmspeakers, but others soon followed.": "在塞弗林（在提亚马特的巧妙引导下）发现了这个秘密后，他将邪教的所有资源用于在其秘密藏身之处寻找失落已久的龙面具。当他找到红色面具时，塞弗林成为第一个讲巫术的人，但其他人也很快跟上。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon has kept secret its goal to bring Tiamat into the world thus far. Many know of the cult's increased activity along the Sword Coast, especially in the north, but the reasons behind the resurgence are unknown.": "迄今为止，神龙教一直对其将提亚马特引入世界的目标保密。许多人都知道该邪教在剑海岸的活动有所增加，尤其是在北部，但其复苏背后的原因却不得而知。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon is organized in cells, which vary in size from just a handful of members to scores. Leaders in the cult are known as Wearers of Purple, and they outrank normal cultists, but no formal grades exist within the ranks of the Wearers of Purple.": "神龙教是以小组为单位组织的，小组的规模从几名成员到几十名成员不等。邪教中的领袖被称为 \"穿紫 \"者，他们的地位高于普通的邪教成员，但在 \"穿紫 \"者的队伍中没有正式的等级。",
	"Although the cult uses regalia in its rituals and its distant camps, members who operate in public places dress and act no differently from anyone else.": "尽管该邪教在其仪式和远处的营地中使用礼服，但在公共场所活动的成员的穿着和行为与其他人没有区别。",
	"The cult is not above hiring mercenaries when it has special jobs to fulfill. Indeed, many of the \"cultists\" that characters encounter in the first three chapters of this adventure are working for pay.": "当邪教有特殊的工作需要完成时，它也会雇佣雇佣兵。事实上，在这次冒险的前三章中，角色们遇到的许多 \"邪教徒 \"都是为了报酬而工作。",
	"During the time covered by the first half of this adventure, the cult already has several of the five dragon masks. While the cult works to gain more, Severin initiates the second part of his plan to release Tiamat: recruiting dragons and assembling a treasure hoard worthy of the queen of evil dragons. These efforts draw the characters' attention to the cult.": "在本冒险的前半部分所涵盖的时间里，邪教已经拥有了五个龙面具中的几个。在邪教组织努力获得更多的时候，塞弗林启动了他释放提亚马特计划的第二部分：招募龙并组建一个配得上恶龙女王的宝库。这些努力引起了人物对邪教的注意。",
	"The action begins when a town comes under attack by a dragon and its allies. Characters can intervene to save townsfolk, but not before attackers carry away an important scholar. While rescuing that captive from the raiders' camp, characters learn they are up against the Cult of the Dragon, and they have the chance to destroy a subterranean dragon hatchery that the cult guards.": "行动开始时，一个小镇受到一条龙和它的盟友的攻击。角色们可以出面拯救镇民，但在袭击者带走一位重要学者之前。在从袭击者的营地中救出这个俘虏时，角色们得知他们的对手是龙的崇拜，他们有机会摧毁该崇拜所守护的地下龙孵化场。",
	"The hatchery provides clues to the cult's operation and sends the characters on a long journey northward. During that trip, they face threats from the cult and gain some unexpected allies within the Zhentarim, a shadowy organization with an unsavory history. North of Waterdeep, the cult's contraband is offloaded at a smuggler's den for shipment to a castle long ago abandoned.": "孵化场为邪教的运作提供了线索，并将这些人物送上了向北的漫长旅程。在这次旅行中，他们面临着来自邪教的威胁，并在Zhentarim中获得了一些意想不到的盟友，这是一个有着不光彩历史的阴暗组织。在沃特迪普北部，邪教的违禁品在一个走私窝点被卸下，运往一个早已废弃的城堡。",
	"{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT} continues the tale of {@i Tyranny of Dragons}. Characters begin this adventure at 8th level, likely having attained that level through the events of the first volume, {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}. By this adventure's conclusion, the characters should reach approximately 15th level. Four characters is the ideal party size. If your group is smaller than that, consider removing a few opponents from combat encounters. If the group is bigger, add opponents to the fights. Consider altering encounters for smaller groups to avoid overly tough battles.": "{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}继续讲述了{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的故事。角色开始这次冒险时是8级，很可能是通过第一卷的事件达到了这个等级，{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}。在这次冒险结束时，人物应该达到大约15级。四个角色是理想的聚会规模。如果你的队伍比这个人数少，可以考虑从战斗遭遇中删除一些对手。如果队伍比较大，就在战斗中增加对手。考虑为小团体改变遭遇战，以避免过于艰难的战斗。",
	"The time of dragons dawns. Calling upon ancient magic and a host of draconic allies, the Cult of the Dragon seeks to unleash Tiamat from her prison in the Nine Hells. By bringing the Queen of Dragons bodily into the world, the cult plans to scour away their foes and usher in a new age of draconic dominance. So far, they've gathered great stores of treasure, forged an alliance with Thay to assist with performing the required summoning ritual, gathered the five dragon masks central to the ritual (see \"{@area Dragon Masks|009|x},\" below), and persuaded or cajoled many of the oldest and strongest evil dragons of Faerûn into supporting them.": "龙的时代来临了。召唤着古老的魔法和一大批龙族盟友，龙之崇拜试图将提亚马特从她在九层地狱的监狱中释放出来。通过将龙后带入世界，该教派计划扫除他们的敌人，并迎来一个龙族统治的新时代。到目前为止，他们已经收集了大量的财宝，与泰伊结成联盟，协助进行所需的召唤仪式，收集了仪式中最重要的五个龙面具（见下文\"{@area Dragon Masks|009|x}\"），并说服或劝说了许多法鲁恩最古老、最强大的恶龙支持他们。",
	"However, not everything has gone according to the cult's plans. The discovery of an alliance between the Cult of the Dragon and the Red Wizards of Thay has shaken the various factions aligned against both organizations. The Harpers view any such alliance as an abomination, as does the Order of the Gauntlet. The Lords' Alliance recognizes the obvious threat to the lands and rulers of the Sword Coast and the North, while the Emerald Enclave suspects that anything Thay promotes is likely against the natural order. Even the Zhentarim fear the union of two such powerful forces.": "然而，并非一切都按照邪教的计划进行。发现神龙教和泰伊的红袍巫师之间的联盟，动摇了与这两个组织结盟的各个派别。哈珀人认为任何这样的联盟都是可憎的，高塔骑士团也是如此。领主联盟认识到对剑海岸和北方的土地和统治者的明显威胁，而翡翠飞地则怀疑泰伊所提倡的任何东西都可能违反自然秩序。甚至赞塔林也害怕两个如此强大的势力的联合。",
	"News of the alliance has thus brought the various factions of the Sword Coast together. The leaders of those factions understand that they must gather and rally forces to fight the cult, even as the situation in Faerûn grows more dire. Abductions and raids undertaken by the Cult of the Dragon increase daily, and refugees are fleeing from burned-out regions under cult attack to major cities and fortresses. Villagers have abandoned their homes, fleeing the constant predation of dragons. In many cities, all-out panic has created a growing movement in favor of agreeing to the cult's demands in the hope of winning concessions in return. It is difficult to muster troops when people are afraid they will be burned by dragonfire. This is a time for heroes to inspire the people of the Sword Coast with a great victory or two. Fortunately, the Forgotten Realms has just such a group of heroes.": "因此，联盟的消息让剑海岸的各个派别走到了一起。这些派别的领导人明白，他们必须聚集和集结力量来对抗邪教，即使法鲁恩的局势变得更加严峻。神龙教的绑架和袭击每天都在增加，难民们正从被邪教攻击的烧毁地区逃往主要城市和堡垒。村民们放弃了他们的家园，以逃避龙的不断掠夺。在许多城市，全面的恐慌产生了一个日益增长的运动，赞成同意邪教的要求，希望能赢得让步的回报。当人们害怕他们会被龙火烧死时，很难召集军队。这是一个英雄们用一两个伟大的胜利来鼓舞剑海岸人民的时刻。幸运的是，被遗忘的国度就有这样一群英雄。",
	"In the first volume of {@i Tyranny of Dragons}, the Cult of the Dragon gathered up a hoard for Tiamat—then lost a portion of that hoard when Skyreach Castle fell. All the while, the cult kept secret its goal of bringing back Tiamat and its alliance with an exiled group of Red Wizards of Thay. The cult now needs only to gather enough sacrifices to power the ritual by which the dragon masks will open a portal to the Nine Hells, allowing Tiamat to travel to the Material Plane.": "在{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的第一卷中，神龙教为提亚马特收集了一批囤积物，然后在天际城堡陷落时失去了一部分囤积物。一直以来，该教派对其带回提亚马特的目标以及与流亡的泰伊红袍巫师团体的联盟保密。邪教现在只需要收集足够的祭品来为仪式提供能量，通过这个仪式，龙面具将打开通往九层地狱的入口，使提亚马特能够前往物质世界。",
		"Four council sessions take place over the course of the adventure, naturally dividing events into four stages. Between the council gatherings, the characters undertake missions to thwart the cult's plans. Some of these missions will be proposed by NPCs (nonplayer characters) during council sessions. Others can be proposed by the characters. The adventurers understand that thousands of lives depend on their actions. The characters are among the greatest heroes of the Sword Coast, and the Council of Waterdeep looks to them for wise guidance and swift action.": "在冒险过程中会有四次议会会议，自然地将事件分为四个阶段。在理事会会议之间，角色们要执行任务来挫败邪教的计划。其中一些任务将由理事会会议期间的NPC（非玩家角色）提出。其他任务可以由角色提出。冒险家们明白，成千上万的生命都取决于他们的行动。这些角色是剑海岸最伟大的英雄之一，沃特德普议会期待他们提供明智的指导和迅速的行动。",
	"Many of the power groups represented on the council don't trust each other, and some even have conflicting goals. Over the course of the council's four meetings, the players and characters need to forge this disparate, feuding group into a coordinated force. Only with all factions working together and contributing to the overall effort can enough power be brought to bear against the cult to prevent Tiamat's return. The more successful the characters are in their actions against the cult, the more esteem and influence they gain with the council.": "理事会中的许多权力团体彼此不信任，有些甚至有冲突的目标。在委员会四次会议的过程中，玩家和角色需要将这个不同的、有分歧的团体锻造成一个协调的力量。只有所有派别一起工作并为整体努力做出贡献，才能有足够的力量来对抗邪教，阻止提亚马特的回归。人物对邪教的行动越成功，他们在议会中获得的尊重和影响就越大。",
	"The events of {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} lead directly into {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}. The shape of this adventure is defined by the meetings of the Council of Waterdeep, which divide the adventure into four stages.": "{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}的事件直接导致了{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}。这场冒险的形式是由沃特德普议会的会议决定的，它将冒险分为四个阶段。",
	"The adventurers learn the location of one of the cult's highest-ranking leaders—Wyrmspeaker Varram. After discovering that Varram is held captive by yuan-ti in the Serpent Hills, the characters can fight the yuan-ti and negotiate to take custody of the cultist.": "冒险家们得知了邪教最高级别的领袖之一--巫师瓦拉姆的位置。在发现瓦拉姆被元老们囚禁在蛇山之后，冒险者们可以与元老们战斗，并通过谈判取得对该邪教者的监护权。",
	"Maccath the Crimson, a tiefling sorcerer of the Arcane Brotherhood, is an acknowledged expert on the {@item Draakhorn|RoT}—an ancient relic being used by the cult to summon dragons to their cause. She disappeared three years ago in the Sea of Moving Ice, where she is presently a prisoner of the white dragon Arauthator. The characters must make their way to Arauthator's iceberg lair and convince Maccath to join them. By driving away the dragon and carrying off valuable dragon lore, they deal a blow to the cult and might gain the Arcane Brotherhood as allies in the process.": "深红的马卡思是奥术兄弟会的一名铁皮人巫师，是公认的{@item Draakhorn|RoT}专家--一个被邪教用来召唤龙的古老遗物。她三年前在移动的冰海中失踪了，目前她被白龙Arauthator囚禁在那里。角色们必须前往Arauthator的冰山巢穴，说服Maccath加入他们。通过赶走龙并带走有价值的龙的传说，他们对邪教进行了打击，并可能在这个过程中获得奥术兄弟会的盟友。",
	"The cult's leaders aren't oblivious to the damage being caused by the heroes. Assassins try to stop the characters' interference, but the cultists misjudge the strength needed to complete the job.": "邪教的领导人并没有对英雄们造成的伤害视而不见。刺客们试图阻止人物的干扰，但邪教分子错误地判断了完成工作所需的力量。",
	"The characters regroup with the leaders of the Sword Coast's factions at the Council of Waterdeep, assessing their victories over the cult and planning the factions' next moves.": "角色们在沃特德普议会与剑海岸各派系的领袖重新聚集，评估他们对邪教的胜利，并计划各派系的下一步行动。",
	"The Emerald Enclave requests that the adventurers help them investigate the aftermath of cult raids led by a green dragon in the Misty Forest—a dragon possibly controlled by one of the cult's wyrmspeakers. That investigation leads to a showdown against the green dragon Chuth and Wyrmspeaker Neronvain, who has a surprising connection to the council.": "翡翠飞地要求冒险家们帮助他们调查迷雾森林中绿龙带领的邪教袭击事件的后果--绿龙可能被邪教的巫师之一控制。这项调查导致了一场与绿龙楚斯和巫师纳隆温的对决，后者与议会有着惊人的联系。",
	"The metallic dragons of the Sword Coast send word to the Council of Waterdeep that they wish to participate in the coming struggle. The adventurers are chosen to attend a council of dragons in the Sunset Mountains, pleading the humanoid factions' case to some of the oldest and most powerful creatures in Faerûn.": "剑海岸的金属龙向沃特德普的议会传话，说他们希望参与即将到来的斗争。冒险家们被选中参加落日山脉的龙族议会，向法鲁恩最古老、最强大的生物恳求人形派别的情况。",
	"After a first attempt to assassinate the heroes failed, the Cult of the Dragon tries again. With a better idea of what they're up against, they have a better chance to succeed.": "在第一次试图暗杀英雄的行动失败后，神龙教再次尝试。由于对他们的对手有了更多的了解，他们的成功机会更大。",
	"At the third meeting of the Council of Waterdeep, the characters take lead roles in shaping the fight against the cult.": "在沃特德普议会的第三次会议上，这些人物在塑造打击邪教的斗争中发挥了主导作用。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon is not without its own internal strife, as the adventurers discover when a cultist contacts them with the offer to turn over one of the dragon masks essential to Severin's plans. The characters must infiltrate a cult stronghold and claim the mask, then save a nearby village from the blue dragon that means to take the relic back.": "当一个邪教分子与他们联系，提出交出对塞弗林的计划至关重要的一个龙形面具时，冒险者们发现，龙之教并非没有内部纷争。冒险家们必须潜入邪教的据点，夺取面具，然后从企图夺回遗物的蓝龙手中拯救附近的村庄。",
	"The ritual that will bring Tiamat to Faerûn is too complex for the cult's spellcasters to perform without their Red Wizard allies—all Thayan exiles. The adventurers travel to Thay to forge an alliance with the Red Wizards, whose lich lord Szass Tam hungers for revenge against the exiles. The Red Wizards of Thay are evil to the core, though, and the delegates must tread carefully as they present their case.": "将提亚马特带到法鲁恩的仪式太过复杂，如果没有他们的红袍巫师盟友--都是泰安的流亡者，邪教的施法者们是无法完成的。冒险家们前往泰伊，与红袍巫师结成联盟，他们的巫师领主萨斯-塔姆渴望向流亡者复仇。不过，泰伊的红袍巫师们邪恶至极，代表们在陈述他们的情况时必须小心谨慎。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon now knows the adventurers' strengths and methods. If the characters don't take precautions to safeguard themselves, the cult stands a good chance of killing them all with a third attack.": "神龙教现在知道了冒险者们的实力和方法。如果人物不采取预防措施保护自己，邪教很有可能通过第三次攻击将他们全部杀死。",
	"At the final meeting of the council, the characters must work to unite the factions of the Sword Coast for the final battle against the Cult of the Dragon. Severin is ready to fulfill his plans, and the combined forces of the Sword Coast must strike now if the cult is to be stopped.": "在议会的最后一次会议上，角色们必须努力团结剑海岸的各个派别，与神龙教进行最后的战斗。塞弗林已经准备好实现他的计划，如果要阻止邪教，剑海岸的联合力量现在必须出击。",
	"At the Well of Dragons, a battle unfolds that will decide the fate of Faerûn. The factions of the Sword Coast fight alongside new and unexpected allies, facing off against the assembled might of the dragon cultists, flights of chromatic dragons, other monsters, and mercenaries. The adventurers choose their own role during the battle, and might rescue sacrificial prisoners, shut down the {@item Draakhorn|RoT}, or take the lead in disrupting the magical ritual that will allow Tiamat to enter the world.": "在龙之井，一场决定Faerûn命运的战斗展开了。剑海岸的各派别与新的和出乎意料的盟友一起战斗，面对龙崇拜者的集结力量、色龙的飞行、其他怪物和雇佣兵的对抗。冒险家们在战斗中选择自己的角色，可能拯救牺牲的囚犯，关闭{@item Draakhorn|RoT}，或者带头破坏让蒂阿玛特进入世界的魔法仪式。",
	"Tyranny of Dragons: {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT} was designed around the milestone system of advancement. At the start of the adventure, the characters should be 7th or 8th level. Instead of tracking specific experience awards, characters can level up at the completion of significant chapters of the adventure. The characters level up after every chapter listed below:": "龙的暴政。{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}是围绕里程碑式的晋级系统设计的。在冒险开始时，角色应该是7级或8级。角色可以在完成冒险的重要章节时提升等级，而不是跟踪特定的经验奖励。角色在下面列出的每一章之后都会提升等级。",
	"Leveling up after seven milestones should bring the characters to 14th or 15th level in time for the final battle at the Well of Dragons.": "在七个里程碑之后的等级提升应该能使角色在龙之井的最后一战中及时达到14或15级。",
	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} can be adapted to different regions of the Forgotten Realms, or to a different campaign setting entirely with a bit of preparation on your part. Change the names, factions, and locations present in the adventure to suit your own campaign.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}可以适用于被遗忘的王国的不同地区，或者完全适用于不同的战役背景，只要你做一点准备。改变冒险中的名称、派别和地点，以适应你自己的活动。",
	"The {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT} makes use of certain NPCs from {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}, and makes the assumption that those NPCs escaped any conflict with the adventurers.": "{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}利用了{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}的某些NPC，并假设这些NPC逃避了与冒险者的任何冲突。",
	"In the event that important nonplayer characters such as {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ|Wyrmspeaker Rezmir} or the Red Wizard {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ} were killed or captured, simply replace them with new nonplayer characters here—or assume that they were resurrected between the previous adventure and this one. NPCs returning from the dead show the level of magical power the cult and its Red Wizard allies wield—and their dedication to seeing Severin's plans brought to fruition.": "如果重要的非玩家角色，如{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ|Wyrmspeaker Rezmir}或红袍巫师{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}被杀或被俘，只需在这里用新的非玩家角色替换他们--或者假设他们在上一次冒险和这一次冒险之间复活了。死而复生的NPC显示了邪教及其红袍巫师盟友的魔力水平--以及他们对看到塞弗林的计划得以实现的奉献精神。",
	"{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT} is an open-framework adventure designed for higher-level characters. As such, not all your game sessions need to stick to the main track of the adventure narrative. Additional events, rumors, and encounters can be used as needed or added as side treks or distractions. The following encounter seeds are meant to be used when you want to break up the narrative or if the players get off track. Each can be expanded as you like, and is meant to tie into one of the main chapters in the adventure (or to let you gently guide the players in that direction). Each additional encounter also provides a sense of the wider scope of the setting.": "{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}是一个为高等级角色设计的开放式框架的冒险。因此，并不是所有的游戏环节都需要坚持冒险叙事的主轨道。额外的事件、传言和遭遇可以根据需要使用，也可以作为侧面的跋涉或分散注意力而添加。下面这些遭遇的种子，是为了在你想打破叙事的时候，或者在玩家偏离轨道的时候使用。每一个都可以根据你的需要进行扩展，目的是与冒险中的一个主要章节联系起来（或者让你温和地引导玩家往那个方向走）。每一个额外的遭遇也能让人感受到更广泛的环境。",
	"A charismatic {@creature half-red dragon veteran} leads a band of 21 {@creature Kobold||kobolds} and 7 {@creature lizardfolk}, taking advantage of the unrest along the Sword Coast. The group might besiege a village the characters are staying at, raid and enslave another settlement, or start charging tolls along one of the trade roads of the Sword Coast. This band isn't organized enough to attack all at once and provide a significant challenge to the party. Instead, it shows the increasing anarchy of the region, and the way that Tiamat's rise has emboldened evil creatures that aren't directly serving the Dragon Queen.": "一个有魅力的{@creature half-red dragon veteran}领导一个由21个{@creature Kobold||kobolds}和7个{@creature lizardfolk}组成的队伍，利用剑海岸的动乱。这支队伍可能会围攻人物所在的村庄，袭击并奴役另一个定居点，或者开始沿着剑海岸的某条贸易道路收取通行费。这支队伍还没有组织起来，不足以同时发动攻击，给党派带来重大挑战。相反，它显示了该地区日益严重的无政府状态，以及提亚马特的崛起使那些不直接为龙后服务的邪恶生物胆战心惊的方式。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon expands its operation in larger and bolder ways. Its leaders send diplomatic missions to Berdusk, Triel, and other settlements demanding tribute—and offering protection from dragon raids for those who comply. Cultists shake down caravans seeking protection money, and have been burning caravans that belong to the rivals of those who do pay. Less scrupulous merchants are finding it easier to do business with the cult than to fight against them. Any Zhentarim contacts of the adventurers are understandably worried about these developments.": "神龙教以更大、更大胆的方式扩展其行动。其领导人向伯达斯克（Berdusk）、特里尔（Triel）和其他定居点派出外交使团，要求进贡--并为那些遵守规定的人提供保护，使其免受龙的袭击。崇拜者摇晃着寻求保护费的商队，并一直在焚烧属于那些付钱的人的对手的商队。没有那么多顾虑的商人发现与邪教做生意比与他们作对更容易。冒险者的任何Zhentarim联系人都对这些发展感到担忧，这是可以理解的。",
	"Though the Cult of the Dragon and the Red Wizards are making use of diabolic allies as they plan the ritual that will free Tiamat, not all devils are on their side. Some fiends not wanting to see Tiamat gain worldly power seek to break the alliance between the cult and Thay. This encounter can be used to reveal to the characters the divisions already present among the evil factions.": "尽管神龙教和红袍巫师在计划释放提亚马特的仪式时利用了邪恶的盟友，但并非所有魔鬼都站在他们一边。一些不愿意看到提亚马特获得世俗权力的魔鬼试图破坏邪教和泰伊之间的联盟。这个遭遇可以用来向人物揭示邪恶派别之间已经存在的分歧。",
	"Lord Volmer also tells the party that the lords of the Nine Hells are divided when it comes to the matter of Tiamat's release. He tells the party that if Tiamat is prevented from escaping, the party will earn \"powerful friends\" in the Nine Hells. If the characters attack Lord Volmer, he and his allies retaliate. The devil is not worried about dying, since he reforms at full strength in the Nine Hells upon his demise.": "沃尔默勋爵还告诉大家，在释放提亚马特的问题上，九层地狱的领主们存在分歧。他告诉队伍，如果阻止提亚马特逃跑，队伍将在九层地狱赢得 \"强大的朋友\"。如果人物攻击沃尔默大人，他和他的盟友就会进行报复。魔鬼并不担心死亡，因为他死后会在九层地狱中全力改造。",
	"A group of dwarf miners has captured a high-ranking member of the Cult of the Dragon—a Wearer of Purple named Cheela Flegsteel who got a little too greedy while leading a group of cultists that was terrorizing the dwarves. Having killed Cheela's drakes and subordinates, the dwarves bring their prisoner to the adventurers hoping for a reward.": "一群矮人矿工抓到了一个龙神教的高级成员--一个名叫切拉-弗莱格斯特尔的紫袍人，他在领导一群恐吓矮人的邪教分子时有点太贪婪了。在杀死了切拉的德拉克人和部下后，矮人把他们的俘虏带到了冒险者面前，希望能得到奖励。",

If her fellow cultists can't save Cheela, they might kill her rather than leave her in the adventurers' hands.": "切拉拥有关于邪教活动的有用信息，可以用来引导进入你选择的任何章节。然而，她也知道，一支救援队就在她身后不远处。冒险家们需要帮助矮人抵御4个{@creature Ogre||ogres}和一个叫Yggran的{@creature half-red dragon veteran}的攻击。矮人无可奈何地不堪一击，只得逃跑，而不是战斗。如果她的同伴不能救出切拉，他们可能会杀了她，而不是把她留在冒险者的手中。",
	"The adventurers meet a seriously injured elf ranger—a well-known hero named Cylanestriel. She speaks of her capture by the Cult of the Dragon and her escape from the stronghold at the caldera of the Well of Dragons. (If possible, make Cylanestriel an associate, mentor, or relative of someone in the party.)": "冒险家们遇到了一个受了重伤的精灵游侠--一个著名的英雄，名叫赛兰斯崔尔。她讲述了她被龙神教俘虏以及从龙之井火山口的据点逃出的经过。(如果可能的话，让赛兰斯崔尔成为党内某个人的同事、导师或亲戚。）",
	"Use this encounter to make the players aware of the dangers presented by a direct assault against the Well of Dragons. The army of the cult is huge and powerful enough to have destroyed a major adventuring group. The Well of Dragons is on alert, and its defensive forces include flights of dragons that prowl the skies above the site. The characters should be made to understand that attacking with a large allied force is their only option for defeating the cult.": "利用这个遭遇战，让玩家意识到直接攻击龙之井所带来的危险。邪教组织的军队非常庞大，强大到足以摧毁一个主要的冒险团。龙之井处于警戒状态，其防御力量包括在该地上空游荡的龙群。应该让角色们明白，与庞大的联军一起进攻是他们击败邪教的唯一选择。",
	"If the characters investigate, they can obtain the body to question it using {@spell speak with dead}, or they might use {@spell commune} to discover the spy. The succubus has gained another victim by that point—a knight of the Order of the Gauntlet who regularly goes to meet her at her slum dwelling in the Field Ward of Waterdeep. This pattern of murder and suicide continues unless the spy's true identity is discovered.": "如果人物进行调查，他们可以用{@spell speak with dead}获得尸体进行询问，也可能用{@spell commune}发现间谍。这时，魅魔又多了一个受害者--高塔骑士团的骑士，他经常到她在沃特德普的田野区的贫民窟住所去见她。除非间谍的真实身份被发现，否则这种谋杀和自杀的模式会继续下去。",
	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} is a big, sprawling adventure that covers many levels of play and a huge swath of the Forgotten Realms. This book outlines the overall structure of the adventure and presents many chapters and events with which to challenge the characters as they investigate the nefarious plots of the Cult of the Dragon. This is not, however, a script to be read aloud with stage directions that must be followed. {@i Tyranny of Dragons} does not hold your hand and guide you step-by-step from the story's beginning to its inevitable conclusion. Instead, it presents people, creatures, locations, and situations for the adventurers to explore and interact with in a constantly changing, lively way.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}是一个大型的、庞大的冒险，涵盖了许多层次的游戏和被遗忘的领域的大片区域。本书概述了冒险的整体结构，并提出了许多章节和事件，在人物调查龙之教的邪恶阴谋时对他们进行挑战。然而，这并不是一个可以大声朗读的剧本和必须遵守的舞台指示。{@i Tyranny of Dragons}不会牵着你的手，一步一步地引导你从故事的开始到其不可避免的结论。相反，它为冒险者提供了人物、生物、地点和情况，让他们以不断变化、生动的方式进行探索和互动。",
	"You, the Dungeon Master, play a vital role. The creators of {@i Tyranny of Dragons} have tried to foresee the most likely courses of action that the characters might take in the adventure. However, D&D players are curious and unpredictable, and Faerûn is immense and filled with possibility. In a scenario as open-ended as this one, it is all but guaranteed that at some point during the adventure—and possibly at many points—the players will develop their own ideas about how to handle a situation or how to deal with the cult. And just like that, they'll be off and running in directions that aren't covered by this book. Those kinds of situations put a DM's skill to the test—but they also produce some of the greatest gaming moments and memories.": "你，地下城管理员，扮演着一个重要的角色。{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的创作者已经试图预见人物在冒险中最可能采取的行动路线。然而，D&D玩家是好奇的、不可预测的，而Faerûn是巨大的，充满了可能性。在一个像这样的开放式场景中，几乎可以保证在冒险过程中的某个时刻--可能是很多时刻--玩家会对如何处理某种情况或如何处理邪教组织产生自己的想法。就这样，他们就会向本书没有涉及的方向跑去。这类情况对管理员的技能是个考验，但它们也会产生一些最美好的游戏时刻和回忆。",
	"The plot to return Tiamat to the mortal realm has brought some of Faerûn's most sinister organizations and most powerful monsters into deadly alliance.": "将提亚马特送回凡间的阴谋使法鲁恩一些最邪恶的组织和最强大的怪物结成了致命的联盟。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon has existed for centuries. During most of that time, its members have focused on the creation and worship of dracoliches, based on a prophecy translated by the cult's founder, Sammaster. However, those goals changed with the rise of a young cultist named {@creature Severin|RoT}.": "龙的崇拜已经存在了几个世纪。在大部分时间里，其成员根据邪教创始人Sammaster翻译的预言，专注于创造和崇拜龙的工作。然而，这些目标随着一个名叫{@creature Severin|RoT}的年轻邪教徒的崛起而改变。",
	"Inspired by Tiamat, Severin reexamined the texts translated by Sammaster and discovered a different interpretation, believing that \"naught will be left save shattered thrones, with no rulers but the dead. Dragons shall rule the world entire...\" Severin's quest to reshape the cult led him to the dragon Hoondarrh, \"the Red Rage of Mintarn.\" The fact that Severin not only survived this encounter but befriended the dragon impressed Tiamat in her exile in the Nine Hells. As a reward and further test, she allowed Severin a scrap of knowledge regarding the existence of the five dragon masks. Severin took that bit of information and did what few others could have accomplished, searching for and finding all five masks. The task took years to complete, and it led directly to the crisis that Faerûn now faces.": "在提亚马特的启发下，塞弗林重新审视了萨姆斯特尔翻译的文本，发现了不同的解释，认为 \"除了破碎的王座，什么都不会留下，除了死者，没有统治者。龙将统治整个世界......\" 塞弗林对重塑邪教的追求使他找到了龙Hoondarrh，\"Mintarn的红色怒火\"。塞弗林不仅在这次遭遇中幸存下来，而且还与龙结为好友，这给流亡在九层地狱的提亚马特留下了深刻印象。作为奖励和进一步的测试，她允许塞弗林获得有关五龙面具存在的知识碎片。塞弗林带着这一点信息，做了很少有人能完成的事情，寻找并找到了所有五个面具。这项任务耗时多年才完成，它直接导致了法鲁恩现在面临的危机。",
	"Severin kept the red mask for himself. As other masks were found, he presented them to his closest allies in the Cult of the Dragon, granting each the power of a wyrmspeaker. Using the magic of the dragon masks, this Inner Circle of Wyrmspeakers helps Severin prepare the way for Tiamat's return.": "塞弗林为自己保留了红色面具。随着其他面具的发现，他把它们送给了他在神龙教中最亲密的盟友，赋予每个人以巫师的力量。利用龙面具的魔力，这个内部的巫师圈帮助塞弗林为提亚马特的回归做好准备。",
	"The plots of the Cult of the Dragon are secret, but its existence is not. Most folk of the Sword Coast have heard of the cult, but know only that its members revere evil dragons. The cult recruits new members in major cities, and word quickly gets around. Moreover, many cultists engage in legitimate business or are assigned to ordinary academic research. Only a relative few serve as thieves, assassins, and spies.": "神龙教的阴谋是秘密的，但它的存在却不是。剑海岸的大多数人都听说过这个邪教，但只知道其成员崇尚邪恶的龙。该邪教在主要城市招募新成员，消息很快就传开了。此外，许多邪教成员从事合法的商业活动，或被指派从事普通的学术研究。只有相对少数人充当小偷、刺客和间谍。",
	"Dragon-themed symbolism and iconography pervade the cult's official regalia—black clothing that features a cape or cloak cut to resemble dragon wings, and festooned with jewelry and draconic imagery reflecting the wearer's favorite type of dragon. Masks are common at cult gatherings.": "以龙为主题的象征意义和图腾充斥着邪教的官方服饰--黑色的服装，其特点是披风或斗篷剪裁得像龙的翅膀，并缀有反映佩戴者最喜欢的龙类型的珠宝和龙的图像。面具在邪教集会上很常见。",
	"Cultists avoid this regalia in public, but a character who knows what to look for can often pick an incognito dragon cultist out of a crowd. Cultists sometimes greet one another with the sign of Tiamat: right hand extended, palm forward, with all five fingers spread in imitation of Tiamat's five heads. Characters trying to pass as cultists might find this sign useful if they don't overdo it.": "崇拜者在公开场合避免穿这种服装，但知道如何寻找的人往往可以从人群中挑选出一个隐姓埋名的龙崇拜者。教徒们有时会用提亚马特的手势相互问候：伸出右手，手心向前，五指张开，模仿提亚马特的五个头。试图冒充邪教徒的角色可能会发现这个手势很有用，如果他们不做得太过分的话。",
	"Cult members venerate dragons as powerful icons and masters, but their worship is reserved for Tiamat. They look forward to the Dragon Queen's return, believing that she will destroy mortal civilization and usher in a glorious reign of dragons—and of those who helped bring about draconic rule. The complex plot dedicated to bring Tiamat to Faerûn has so far seen the cult recover the five dragon masks and collect an immense treasure worthy of the Dragon Queen. All that now remains is to raise her temple in the Well of Dragons, sacrifice hundreds of victims whose souls will power an ancient ritual, and then use that ritual to open a portal through which Tiamat will emerge from the Nine Hells.": "邪教成员把龙当作强大的偶像和主人来敬仰，但他们的崇拜只保留给提亚马特。他们期待着龙后的回归，相信她会摧毁凡人的文明，迎来龙的辉煌统治--以及那些帮助实现龙族统治的人。到目前为止，致力于将提亚马特带到法鲁恩的复杂阴谋中，邪教组织已经找回了五个龙形面具，并收集了值得龙后使用的巨大财宝。现在剩下的就是在龙之井中建立她的神庙，牺牲数百名受害者，他们的灵魂将为一个古老的仪式提供动力，然后用这个仪式打开一个门户，让提亚马特从九层地狱中出现。",
	"The cult has a simple hierarchical structure, consisting of initiates on the bottom, four ranks for cultists, and one highest rank for \"Wearers of Purple\"—the lords, leaders, and cult masters of particular locales. The cult is ruled by a secretive inner group led by Severin and four other wyrmspeakers—a term of respect given to those whose bond with dragons is supernaturally strong.": "该邪教有一个简单的等级结构，包括最底层的入门者，四个等级的邪教徒，以及一个最高等级的 \"紫衣人\"--特定地区的领主、领袖和邪教主。该邪教由一个秘密的内部团体统治，该团体由塞弗林和其他四名巫师领导，巫师是对那些与龙有超自然联系的人的尊称。",
	"Rank in the cult is based on merit and fanaticism. As raw recruits, initiates (represented by {@creature Cultist||cultists} and {@creature Cult Fanatic||cult fanatics}) have no rank and follow the orders of their superiors. Only initiates that prove their worth are allowed to advance. A Wearer of Purple can promote an initiate along the track of {@creature dragonclaw|HotDQ} (first rank), {@creature dragonwing|HotDQ} (second rank), {@creature dragonfang|RoT} (third rank), and {@creature dragonsoul|RoT} (fourth rank). Statistics for those four ranking cultists are found in {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}.": "邪教的等级是基于功绩和狂热。作为新兵，入教者（由{@creature Cultist||cultists}和{@creature Cult Fanatic||cult fanatics}代表）没有等级，听从上级的命令。只有证明自己价值的入会者才被允许晋升。紫色佩戴者可以沿着{@creature dragonclaw|HotDQ}（一级）、{@creature dragonwing|HotDQ}（二级）、{@creature dragonfang|RoT}（三级）和{@creature dragonsoul|RoT}（四级）的轨道提升入会者。这四个等级的邪教徒的统计数据见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}。",
	"Cult operation groups are assembled to match their assigned tasks. They vary in size, from a few low-ranking cultists operating on their own to hundreds of cultists of various ranks under the control of multiple Wearers of Purple.": "邪教行动小组是根据其指定的任务而组建的。他们的规模各不相同，从几个低级别的邪教人员单独行动到数百名不同级别的邪教人员在多名紫袍佩戴者的控制下行动。",
	"The Wearers of Purple stand at the top of the cult's humanoid hierarchy, and their word is law for the cultists in the cities, strongholds, and lairs they command. They are the only members of the cult to wear purple, and most are proud enough to flaunt the color. The Wearers of Purple have an affinity for talking to and negotiating with dragons—the gift of wyrmspeaking. Dozens of Wearers of Purple are spread throughout the Cult of the Dragon, and all are able to marshal the cult's resources.": "紫色穿戴者站在邪教人形等级制度的顶端，他们的话就是他们所指挥的城市、据点和巢穴中的邪教徒的法律。他们是邪教中唯一穿着紫色衣服的成员，而且大多数人都很自豪地炫耀这种颜色。紫色穿戴者有一种与龙交谈和谈判的亲和力--巫妖之语的天赋。数十名紫色穿戴者分布在整个神龙教中，他们都能调集教派的资源。",
	"Only Severin's inner circle can promote a dragonsoul to a Wearer of Purple, granting that character a base of operations and funds. Most new Wearers of Purple have already developed a working relationship with a dragon as part of their power and authority. Those who do not cultivate and expand this relationship are sometimes demoted. A number of priests of Tiamat have recently been made Wearers of Purple, and have been charged with establishing temples for her open worship in Faerûn. This aspect of the cult's plans is still in the early stages, and the inner circle remains divided on how the Cult of the Dragon should interact with the faithful of Tiamat.": "只有塞弗林的核心圈子可以将一个龙魂晋升为紫衣人，授予该人物一个行动基地和资金。大多数新的紫袍人已经与一条龙建立了工作关系，作为他们权力和权威的一部分。那些没有培养和扩大这种关系的人有时会被降职。一些提亚马特的祭司最近被任命为紫袍佩戴者，并负责在法鲁恩为她建立公开崇拜的寺庙。这方面的计划仍处于早期阶段，内部人士对神龙教应如何与提亚马特的信徒互动仍有分歧。",
	"These four Wearers of Purple are the keepers of the dragon masks and Severin's most devoted servants in the effort to summon Tiamat. Each of these wyrmspeakers bears one of the dragon masks, which they never part with except under the direst circumstances—and then only at the request of Severin or a draconic ally. The members of the inner circle each have an affinity for a particular color of chromatic dragon. They treat with dragons of those colors to recruit more dragons to the cause, and plan cult missions that advance Severin's plots.": "这四位紫袍人是龙面具的守护者，也是塞弗林在召唤提亚马特的努力中最忠实的仆人。每位巫师都有一个龙形面具，除非在最糟糕的情况下，否则他们从不放弃，而且只有在塞弗林或龙族盟友的要求下才会放弃。内圈的成员都对一种特定颜色的色龙有亲和力。他们与这些颜色的龙打交道，以招募更多的龙加入这一事业，并策划邪教任务，推进塞弗林的阴谋。",
	"If any wyrmspeakers are killed or captured in your campaign—including {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}, who the characters might have defeated in {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}—Severin appoints new followers to his inner council.": "如果有任何巫师在你的战役中被杀或被俘--包括{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}，人物可能在{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}中被击败--塞弗林会任命新的追随者进入他的内部委员会。",
	"Under Severin's leadership, most cultists are devoted to Tiamat—but not all. Some of the old guard dislike the cult's new direction, and long for the established traditions and the rise of the dracoliches. A common thought among the dracolich loyalists is that Severin is being played by the fiendish Tiamat. Notable among these members of the old guard are Naergoth Bladelord, the former commander of the stronghold at the Well of Dragons, and Jorgen Pawl and Iskander, two high-ranking cultists in command of Xonthal's Tower.": "在塞弗林的领导下，大多数邪教成员都献身于提亚马特--但不是全部。一些守旧派不喜欢邪教的新方向，他们渴望既有的传统和龙卷风的崛起。德拉科利奇的忠实信徒们普遍认为塞弗林被邪恶的提亚马特所玩弄。这些守旧派成员中值得注意的是龙之井据点的前指挥官纳戈斯-布拉德洛德（Naergoth Bladelord），以及约根-帕尔（Jorgen Pawl）和伊斯坎德（Iskander），这两位高级邪教人员在松塔尔塔的指挥下。",
	"Cultists are suitable foes for the adventurers in most situations. They keep a low profile in public, so characters are unlikely to see cultists in full regalia on the streets of Waterdeep or Scornubel. As their plots near fruition, however, the cultists grow bolder and might engage the adventurers openly.": "在大多数情况下，邪教徒是冒险者的合适敌人。他们在公共场合保持低调，所以角色们不太可能在沃特迪普或斯科努贝尔的街道上看到身着盛装的邪教分子。然而，随着他们的计划接近尾声，邪教徒们会变得更加大胆，并可能与冒险家们公开交锋。",
	"By the start of {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}, the effects of the cult's activities are visible across the Sword Coast. The scorched ruins of farming communities pillaged by cultists for Tiamat's hoard are a common enough occurrence that travelers know something is amiss.": "在{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}开始的时候，邪教活动的影响在整个剑海岸都是可见的。被邪教分子掠夺了蒂阿马特的囤积物的农业社区的焦土废墟是一种常见的现象，以至于旅行者知道有些事情是不对劲的。",
	"The Red Wizards hail from Thay, over two thousand miles east of the Sword Coast. A grim, dismal region spread across a towering plateau, Thay is defended by an army of undead warriors and ruled by the lich Szass Tam and the zulkirs he appoints to rule over the eight schools of magic. The Red Wizards of Thay are known across Faerûn, and are easily recognized by their distinctive crimson robes and the arcane sigils tattooed onto their shaved heads. Because of their evil reputation, Red Wizards are arrested or killed on the spot in many lands. For that reason, they often travel in disguise, invisibly, or by magical means.": "红袍巫师来自泰伊，在剑海岸以东两千多英里处。泰伊是一个遍布高耸高原的阴森恐怖的地区，由亡灵战士组成的军队防守，并由巫师萨斯-塔姆和他任命的祖尔基尔统治着八个魔法学校。泰伊的红袍巫师在整个法鲁恩都很有名，他们很容易被认出，因为他们穿着独特的深红色长袍，剃光的头上纹着神秘的符号。由于他们的邪恶名声，红袍巫师在许多地方都会被逮捕或当场杀死。出于这个原因，他们经常乔装打扮，隐身，或通过魔法手段出行。",
	"For many years, Szass Tam's grip on absolute power in Thay has been weakened by internal strife. Mortal Red Wizards have risen against their undead masters, destroying some of Szass Tam's lich zulkirs and thinning the ranks of other undead. Little is known of the conflict beyond Thay's borders, however. In this quiet civil war, both sides fear that too much attrition will make Thay a target for its long list of enemies. Szass Tam questions the allegiance of all living Red Wizards outside Thay, and has made it clear that death and worse await any who oppose him.": "多年来，萨斯-塔姆对泰伊绝对权力的控制由于内部纷争而被削弱了。凡人的红袍巫师们已经起来反对他们的亡灵主人，摧毁了萨斯-谭的一些巫师祖尔基尔，并削弱了其他亡灵的队伍。然而，人们对泰伊边界以外的冲突知之甚少。在这场平静的内战中，双方都担心过多的损耗会使泰伊成为其众多敌人的目标。萨斯-谭质疑泰伊以外所有活着的红袍巫师的忠诚度，并明确表示，任何反对他的人都将面临死亡和更坏的结果。",
	"The secret cornerstone of this union is {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}'s belief that once Tiamat returns, she will see that the Red Wizards are more useful allies than the devoted but magically weak cultists. {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ} hopes that Tiamat will show her gratitude for the pivotal role he and his fellow Red Wizards played in her return, granting them an army of dragons with which to assault Thay. After unseating Szass Tam, {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ} plans to take his place at the head of all Red Wizards. Whether Tiamat will grant such a reward—or have any further use for the Red Wizards at all—remains unknown.": "这个联盟的秘密基石是{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}相信一旦提亚马特回来，她会看到红袍巫师是比那些虔诚但魔法薄弱的邪教徒更有用的盟友。{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}希望提亚马特会对他和他的红袍巫师同伴在她的回归中所扮演的关键角色表示感谢，赐予他们一支龙的军队来攻击泰伊。在击败萨斯-塔姆后，{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}计划取代他成为所有红袍巫师的领袖。提亚玛特是否会给予这样的奖励，或者对红袍巫师有任何进一步的利用，都是未知数。",
	"Not all members of the Cult of the Dragon are happy about the Red Wizards' involvement in the cult's plans. Wyrmspeaker Varram foresees trouble in the cult joining forces with {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}'s splinter sect. He has warned Severin about the potential danger, to no avail.": "并非所有的神龙教成员都对红袍巫师参与该教派的计划感到高兴。Wyrmspeaker Varram预见到邪教与{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}的分裂教派联手会带来麻烦。他已经警告过塞弗林这个潜在的危险，但无济于事。",
	"Red Wizards don't share the cultists' fanaticism for Tiamat. For them, bringing the Dragon Queen into the world is just one stage of what they call the Thayan Resurrection—the larger plan to destroy Szass Tam and reclaim Thay. They tolerate the dragon cultists but do not acknowledge them as equals.": "红袍巫师并不认同邪教分子对提亚马特的狂热。对他们来说，将龙后带到这个世界上只是他们所谓的 \"泰雅复活 \"的一个阶段--摧毁萨斯坦并夺回泰伊的更大计划。他们容忍龙的崇拜者，但不承认他们是平等的。",
	"Not every Red Wizard on the Sword Coast is working for {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ} or the Cult of the Dragon. Some pursue their own interests, while others are spies for Szass Tam. The adventurers might thus find themselves making uneasy alliances with characters they would normally never trust, since the easiest and surest way to eliminate a Red Wizard in service to the cult is to betray that wizard's location to an agent of Szass Tam. However, characters who get too close to Szass Tam's servants and his paranoid vendetta against the Red Wizard exiles might find themselves at the mercy of the Thayans. This possibility is explored more fully in {@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}.": "剑海岸的每个红袍巫师并非都在为{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}或神龙教工作。有些人追求自己的利益，而有些人则是萨斯-谭的间谍。因此，冒险者们可能会发现自己与他们通常不会信任的角色结成了不安的联盟，因为要消灭一个为邪教服务的红袍巫师，最简单和最肯定的方法就是将该巫师的位置出卖给萨斯-谭的代理人。然而，那些与萨斯-谭的仆人和他对红袍巫师流亡者的偏执仇杀走得太近的人物，可能会发现自己受到泰安人的摆布。这种可能性将在{@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}中得到更充分的探讨。",
	"Tiamat has long threatened Faerûn, often appearing in lands such as Chessenta and Unther to drive mortals to worship her awesome power. Although mortals don't know it, the end of the Sundering and the Era of Upheaval also put an end to such direct meddling by the gods. Without powerful magic and mortal aid, Tiamat cannot travel from her home in Avernus into the world.": "Tiamat长期以来一直威胁着Faerûn，经常出现在Chessenta和Unther等地，驱使凡人去崇拜她的可怕力量。虽然凡人不知道，但 \"毁灭 \"和 \"动乱时代 \"的结束也结束了诸神的这种直接插手。没有强大的魔法和凡人的帮助，提亚马特无法从她在阿弗纳斯的家进入这个世界。",
	"Avernus is a boulder-strewn desolation where fiery comets streak across the sky and devil aristocrats rule from dismal iron fortresses. The River Styx saws a jagged course through Avernus's basalt cliffs, winds its way across ashen plains, and eventually plunges through a yawning pit into the eight levels of the Hells below. All the rivers of Avernus feed into the Styx, each one flowing red with blood beneath a roiling cloud of flies.": "阿弗纳斯是一片巨石遍布的荒芜之地，火红的彗星划过天空，恶魔贵族们在凄凉的铁堡垒中进行统治。冥河在阿弗纳斯的玄武岩悬崖上锯出一条锯齿状的路线，蜿蜒穿过灰暗的平原，最终穿过一个大坑坠入下面八层地狱。阿弗纳斯的所有河流都汇入冥河，每条河流都在滚滚的苍蝇云下流淌着红色的血液。",
	"Asmodeus recently reinstated the fallen angel Zariel as the Archduchess of Avernus, reversing an earlier decision that allowed a pit fiend named Bel to take the throne. While in exile from her seat of power, Zariel was at the mercy of Tiamat—a fate that rankles her still. Despite her power as ruler of the first layer of the Nine Hells, Zariel cannot kill the dragon goddess, and she sees the summoning of Tiamat to the world as a way to be rid of her.": "阿斯莫德最近恢复了堕落天使扎里尔作为阿弗纳斯大公夫人的地位，推翻了先前允许一个名为贝尔的坑道恶魔夺取王位的决定。当扎丽尔从她的权力所在地流亡时，她受到了提亚马特的摆布--这是令她至今感到不安的命运。尽管她拥有九层地狱第一层统治者的权力，但扎瑞尔无法杀死龙神，她认为将提亚马特召唤到这个世界是摆脱她的一种方式。",
	"Zariel has directed her mortal agents to assist those who seek to free Tiamat, and her power has made it easier for the Red Wizards to summon devils and for the Cult of the Dragon to find more adherents. However, just as Zariel wants Tiamat out, other devils would be happy to see the Dragon Queen stay in Avernus. Foremost among them is the deposed pit fiend Bel and the devils still loyal to him.": "扎丽尔已经指示她的凡人特工协助那些寻求释放提亚马特的人，她的力量使红袍巫师更容易召唤魔鬼，使龙之崇拜找到更多的信徒。然而，就像扎里尔希望提亚马特离开一样，其他魔鬼也很乐意看到龙后留在阿弗纳斯。其中最重要的是被废黜的地狱魔王贝尔和仍然忠于他的魔鬼。",
	"Ordinarily, the Cult of the Dragon has nothing to do with devils. However, releasing Tiamat into the world is a massive undertaking, and Severin has called on every resource he can. Though many of his allies among the Red Wizards are well schooled in summoning and commanding devils, doing so is never a straightforward process. Devils cannot leave the Nine Hells of their own accord, and though Asmodeus can bend these laws, he seldom does. Most devils in the Material Plane were summoned there by mortal mages who expended tremendous amounts of magical power to breach the barriers that separate the Nine Hells from other planes.": "通常情况下，神龙教与魔鬼毫无关系。然而，将提亚马特释放到这个世界上是一项巨大的工程，塞弗林已经调用了他能调用的所有资源。尽管他在红袍巫师中的许多盟友在召唤和指挥魔鬼方面都很有经验，但这样做从来都不是一个简单的过程。魔鬼不能主动离开九层地狱，尽管阿斯摩德可以弯曲这些法律，但他很少这样做。物质界的大多数魔鬼都是由凡人法师召唤而来，他们耗费了巨大的魔力来突破九幽地狱与其他位面之间的障碍。",
	"Devils in the adventure should always be one step ahead of the adventurers. Characters who like to charge in and decide on strategy later will find that their diabolical foes have well-executed plans. If the characters plan two steps ahead, the devils are one step beyond that. Nothing mortals do should ever surprise them.": "冒险中的魔鬼应该总是比冒险者领先一步。那些喜欢冲锋陷阵，稍后再决定策略的角色会发现，他们的恶魔般的敌人有着完善的计划。如果角色提前两步计划，魔鬼们就会超前一步。凡人所做的任何事情都不应该让他们吃惊。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon has a secret weapon for dealing with chromatic dragons, in the form of the five dragon masks. Even with a dragon mask, the process of influencing a dragon remains arduous and dangerous—though the payoff is enormous. These relics give their wearers the ability to communicate with dragons, but more importantly, they impart a subtle influence over dragons that cannot be detected. Dragons cannot be controlled by the masks, but they can be swayed by ideas and proposals that they would not normally find persuasive.": "神龙教有一个对付色龙的秘密武器，就是五个龙形面具。即使有了龙面具，影响龙的过程仍然是艰巨而危险的--尽管回报是巨大的。这些遗物赋予佩戴者与龙沟通的能力，但更重要的是，它们对龙施加了一种无法察觉的微妙影响。龙不能被面具控制，但它们可以被通常认为没有说服力的想法和建议所动摇。",
	"The power of the chromatic dragons is a motif running through every aspect of Tyranny of Dragons: {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}. As the events of the adventure unfold, more and more dragons respond to the {@item Draakhorn|RoT|Draakhorn's} rumbling moan and journey to the Well of Dragons—a migration that inspires alarm and panic in people across Faerûn.": "色素龙的力量是贯穿《龙的暴政》各个方面的一个主题。{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}. 随着冒险事件的展开，越来越多的龙对{@item Draakhorn|RoT|Draakhorn's}隆隆的呻吟声做出反应，并前往龙之井--这种迁移激发了整个法鲁恩人们的警觉和恐慌。",
	"Characters and players should seldom be allowed to forget that the evil dragons are on the move. Whenever the adventurers are outside, they might see a dragon winging overhead in the distance. The shadow of a dragon could fall across the adventurers in the daytime, and dark draconic wings might momentarily blot out the moon at night. When the characters arrive in a settlement, they should hear stories about dragon sightings and attacks. When they travel, burned-out hamlets and demolished caravans line the road.": "应该很少让角色和玩家忘记恶龙在移动。只要冒险者在外面，他们就可能看到一条龙在远处的上空飞翔。白天，龙的影子可能会落在冒险者的身上，晚上，黑暗的龙翼可能会瞬间遮住月亮。当人物到达一个定居点时，他们应该听到关于龙的踪迹和攻击的故事。当他们旅行时，烧毁的小村庄和被拆毁的商队会在路上出现。",
	"Dragons are among the oldest, most intelligent, and most powerful monsters in Faerûn and the Dungeons & Dragons game. Chromatic dragons are evil and merciless, and every battle against these creatures should be a life-or-death struggle. No dragon should ever fall without the heroes suffering during the battle. Chromatic dragons use every possible advantage with no regard for fairness, and their chief advantage is flight. A dragon never fights on foot where enemies might hack at it when it can soar majestically out of reach and slaughter foes with its breath weapon. Only in its lair will a dragon typically engage in melee, and then only if its hoard is threatened.": "龙是Faerûn和《龙与地下城》游戏中最古老、最聪明、最强大的怪物之一。色素龙是邪恶和无情的，每一次与这些生物的战斗都应该是一场生死攸关的斗争。在战斗中，没有任何一条龙可以在英雄们不受伤害的情况下倒下。色素龙利用一切可能的优势，不顾公平，而它们的主要优势是飞行。龙从不在敌人可能砍杀它的地方步行作战，因为它可以雄伟地翱翔在敌人的视野之外，用它的呼吸武器屠杀敌人。只有在它的巢穴里，龙才会进行近战，而且只有在它的囤积物受到威胁时才会进行。",
	"Characters who can tackle the challenges of this adventure are high enough level to have allies raised from the dead when those allies fall to a draconic foe. If the characters can't do so themselves, their allies in the Order of the Gauntlet or the Harpers should be willing to help out.": "能够应对这次冒险的挑战的角色等级足够高，当这些盟友倒在龙人的敌人面前时，他们可以让盟友从死里复活。如果角色自己不能这样做，他们在高塔骑士团或哈珀斯的盟友应该会愿意帮忙。",
	"With lifetimes of a thousand years or more to lose, chromatic dragons have no interest in dying in battle against mere humanoids, and they don't sacrifice themselves nobly for any cause—Tiamat included. A dragon caught in a losing battle takes any escape that presents itself, most often simply soaring away. This changes during the final showdown at the Well of Dragons, however, when Tiamat can be seen clawing her way through the portal from the Nine Hells.": "有着一千年甚至更久的寿命，色龙对在与普通人类的战斗中死去没有兴趣，它们不会为任何事业高尚地牺牲自己--包括Tiamat。陷入败局的龙会采取任何逃避的方式，最常见的是简单地腾空而去。然而，在龙之井的最后决战中，这种情况发生了变化，人们可以看到提亚马特在九层地狱的门户中张牙舞爪。",
	"If the characters claimed Skyreach Castle in {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}, they might well hear from a frost giant diplomat who shows up to reclaim it as property of the giants who built it. A frost giant named Harshnag lives on Mount Sar north of Waterdeep, and he is sometimes called upon when the Sword Coast faces dire threats. The player characters could fly the citadel to him or—in a more dramatic interlude—he might come to a council meeting and demand the citadel's return on behalf of his kin so that he might rally them against their ancient foes.": "如果人物在{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}中宣称拥有Skyreach城堡，他们很可能会听到一个冰霜巨人外交官出现，将其作为建造它的巨人的财产收回。一个名叫哈什纳格（Harshnag）的冰霜巨人住在沃特迪普北部的萨尔山上，当剑海岸面临可怕的威胁时，他有时会被召唤。玩家角色可以把城堡飞给他，或者在一个更戏剧性的插曲中，他可能会来参加议会会议，代表他的亲属要求归还城堡，这样他就可以召集他们来对抗他们古老的敌人。",
	"If the player characters did not claim the citadel (or crashed it), this option is not available to them.": "如果玩家角色没有认领城堡（或将其撞毁），他们就不能使用这个选项。",
	"Giants are unlikely to appear side by side with dragons anywhere before the final showdown at the Well of Dragons. However, characters who gain any insight into the giants' alliance with the dragons should understand its apocalyptic significance.": "在龙之井的最后决战之前，巨人不太可能在任何地方与龙并肩出现。然而，对巨人与龙的联盟有任何了解的角色都应该理解其世界末日的意义。",
	"Several powerful organizations battle the Cult of the Dragon even as the party does. The characters are key players in the drama, but everyone in Faerûn has a stake in the outcome of the battle against Tiamat and her allies. Each faction has a presence in the Council of Waterdeep, and all factions are ultimately on the adventurers' side—even if some of them occasionally hinder the characters more than they help.": "有几个强大的组织在与龙神教作战，甚至在党内也是如此。这些角色是剧中的关键人物，但法鲁恩的每个人都与对抗提亚马特和她的盟友的战斗结果息息相关。每个派别都在水底议会中占有一席之地，而且所有派别最终都站在冒险者一边--即使他们中的一些人偶尔会阻碍角色而不是帮助他们。",
	"This section describes each faction's goals and driving concerns, its leading delegate or delegates to the council, and what resources it can contribute to the final battle against the Cult of the Dragon.": "本节介绍了每个派别的目标和驱动力，其在议会中的主要代表，以及在与龙神教的最后战斗中可以贡献哪些资源。",
	"The secret society known as the Harpers has been disbanded and rebuilt several times over its long history. The latest incarnation of the group retains its focus on gathering information, keeping a close watch on the balance of power in Faerûn, and promoting fairness and equality in quiet, unobtrusive ways. Harpers try to keep out of the public eye, preferring secrecy to fame and using knowledge to win the day over brute force. However, as the Cult of the Dragon grows more brazen and destructive, the Harpers are forced to act more openly in their opposition.": "被称为哈珀斯的秘密组织在其漫长的历史中已经被解散和重建了好几次。该组织的最新化身仍然专注于收集信息，密切关注法鲁恩的权力平衡，并以安静、不引人注意的方式促进公平和平等。哈珀斯试图远离公众的视线，宁可选择保密也不选择出名，并利用知识来赢得胜利，而不是用蛮力。然而，随着神龙教越来越肆无忌惮和具有破坏性，哈珀人被迫采取更公开的反对行动。",
	"Harper agents operate most effectively alone or in small groups, much like adventurers. When on a mission, they are independent and self-reliant. The ideal Harper is a keen observer, persuasive, and able to go almost anywhere without arousing suspicion.": "哈珀特工单独行动或在小团体中行动最为有效，很像冒险家。在执行任务时，他们是独立和自力更生的。理想的哈珀人是一个敏锐的观察者，有说服力，并且几乎能够去任何地方而不引起怀疑。",
	"NPC Harpers are the kinds of characters who consistently pop up when they're least expected and most useful. If the characters need a safe house in a strange city, are unable to locate an elusive foe, or have been captured by the cult and need inside help to escape, a Harper can offer up a secure hideout, a whispered clue, or a smuggled knife. Bards, mages, and rogues are the most common character types in the Harpers, but characters of every class can be found in the organization.": "NPC哈珀是那种在人们最不期望的时候突然出现的人物，也是最有用的人物。如果角色们在一个陌生的城市需要一个安全的住所，无法找到一个难以捉摸的敌人，或者被邪教抓住了，需要内部帮助才能逃脱，哈珀人可以提供一个安全的藏身之处，一条低声的线索，或者一把走私的刀。吟游诗人、法师和流氓是哈珀人中最常见的角色类型，但每个阶层的角色都可以在该组织中找到。",
	"The elf noble Remallia—\"Remi\" to her friends—is the Harper's leading delegate to the Council of Waterdeep. She is quiet, speaking only after others have had their turn, and is content to let events unfold until she feels a need to offer intervention and guidance. This embodies her attitude about combating the cult as well.": "精灵贵族雷玛利亚--她的朋友们称她为 \"雷米\"--是哈珀家族在水底世界议会的主要代表。她很安静，只有在别人轮到她的时候才发言，并且满足于让事件发展，直到她觉得有必要提供干预和指导。这也体现了她对打击邪教的态度。",
	"Remi is convinced that the rumors of Tiamat's return are true, and she is frustrated by the unwillingness of the other Harpers to commit to fighting the Cult of the Dragon. She understands their hesitation, however. The Harpers' have only recently been reformed, and the cause of their near-destruction was the decision to act more openly and aggressively.": "雷米确信提亚马特回归的传言是真的，她对其他哈珀人不愿致力于打击龙之教感到沮丧。然而，她理解他们的犹豫不决。哈珀人只是在最近才进行了改革，而导致他们几乎毁灭的原因是决定采取更公开和更积极的行动。",
	"The Harpers measure success in the value and quantity of intelligence gained by a course of action, as well as how that knowledge can be used to leverage an enemy into submission. Remallia wants the party to succeed using such tactics, knowing that this will sway the conservatives in her faction.": "哈珀人衡量成功的标准是，通过某项行动获得的情报的价值和数量，以及如何利用这些知识来使敌人屈服。雷玛利亚希望党派利用这种战术取得成功，因为她知道这将动摇她派系中的保守派。",
	"The Harpers are willing to cooperate with unsavory types and leverage evil assets, but not if doing so endangers others unnecessarily. They can respect the deftness and skill needed to make such an arrangement, even if they do not like the arrangement itself. The Harpers are always dissatisfied if the characters kill important cultists rather than capturing them—or at least trying to extract information from them beforehand.": "哈珀人愿意与不怀好意的人合作，并利用邪恶的资产，但如果这样做会不必要地危及他人，则不会。他们可以尊重做出这种安排所需的灵活性和技巧，即使他们不喜欢这种安排本身。如果人物杀死了重要的邪教徒而不是抓住他们--或者至少事先试图从他们那里获取信息，哈珀人总是不满意的。",
	"The Order of the Gauntlet shares the Harpers' dedication to justice and equality, but their methods and attitude are quite different. Bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Evil must be opposed openly and vanquished in the light of day, so that all can see and be emboldened by its destruction.": "高塔骑士团与哈珀斯人一样致力于正义和平等，但他们的方法和态度却截然不同。高塔骑士团的成员都是圣洁的战士，他们正直地追求粉碎邪恶和促进正义，他们从不躲在阴影里。邪恶必须被公开反对，并在光天化日之下被征服，以便所有人都能看到它的毁灭，并为之壮胆。",
	"Members of the order are driven by religious fervor and by devotion to the principle of justice for all. Whether a member places more emphasis on one or the other of those ideals is an individual choice. Camaraderie and esprit de corps run high within the order, and an individual member will risk anything to save a fellow member or to complete an important mission.": "骑士团的成员受宗教狂热和对所有人的正义原则的奉献所驱动。一个成员是否更强调这些理想中的一个或另一个是个人的选择。骑士团内的友情和团队精神很高，个别成员会为了拯救同伴或完成一项重要任务而冒任何风险。",
	"The Order of the Gauntlet is a young organization, and it is eager and restless for action. It does not take orders from any government or temple, although the opinions of holy figures are greatly esteemed within the order. When evil threatens, the gauntlet strikes.": "高塔骑士团是一个年轻的组织，它渴望并不安于行动。它不接受任何政府或寺庙的命令，尽管圣人的意见在该组织内受到极大的尊重。当邪恶受到威胁时，高塔会就会出击。",
	"The Order of the Gauntlet is an invaluable asset at the final showdown at the Well of Dragons. No other faction can muster more paladins and priests to heal the wounded and combat Severin's devil allies directly.": "在龙之井的最后决战中，高塔骑士团是一笔无价的财富。没有其他派别能召集更多的圣骑士和牧师来治疗伤员并直接打击塞弗林的魔鬼盟友。",
	"Before the final battle, members of the order make interesting NPCs for roleplaying encounters because of their outgoing ways and strong opinions. Sharing a roadside inn with twenty paladins from the Order of the Gauntlet, or joining their march for a few days when headed in the same direction, should be a memorable experience.": "在最后的战斗之前，骑士团的成员由于其外向的方式和强烈的意见，成为角色扮演中有趣的NPC。与20名高塔骑士团的圣骑士共用一家路边旅馆，或者在朝同一方向前进时加入他们的行军队伍几天，应该是一次难忘的经历。",
	"Clerics, paladins, and monks make up the majority of the Order of the Gauntlet, but any character of a righteous mind is welcome in the order's ranks.": "牧师、圣骑士和僧侣构成了高塔骑士团的大部分成员，但任何具有正义感的人物都欢迎加入骑士团的行列。",
	"Just as good deeds must be performed in the light for all to see, evil must be shunned and fought at every turn. Members of the order can be won over by heroic and righteous deeds, but they will turn against characters who cooperate with or tolerate evil. The order can best be swayed by actions that demonstrate heroism and divine providence—uniting the metallic dragons to fight Tiamat's brood, for example. Slaying a wyrmspeaker will also serve the party well, while capturing and delivering such a villain to justice will raise them even higher in the order's sight.": "正如善行必须在光明中进行，让所有人都能看到一样，邪恶也必须回避，并处处与之斗争。秩序的成员可以被英雄和正义的行为所征服，但他们会反对与邪恶合作或容忍邪恶的角色。骑士团最容易被那些表现出英雄主义和神圣天意的行为所动摇--例如，联合金属龙来对抗提亚马特的孩子。杀死一个讲巫术的人也会给党带来好处，而捕获并将这样的恶棍绳之以法会让他们在教团的眼中地位更高。",
	"{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}'s dedication to heroic justice creates a strong connection between him and the paladin Sir Isteval. However, Ontharr has difficulty reconciling the heroic Isteval of legend with the diplomatic and retiring figure of the Council of Waterdeep. It's incomprehensible to him why Sir Isteval does not take to the field himself in this great conflict.": "{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}对英雄正义的献身精神使他与圣骑士伊斯特瓦尔爵士之间产生了强烈的联系。然而，昂赛尔很难将传说中英勇的伊斯特瓦尔与沃特德普议会的外交和隐忍形象相协调。他无法理解为什么伊斯特瓦尔爵士不在这场伟大的冲突中亲自上阵。",
	"The Emerald Enclave is dedicated to maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance. Members of the enclave live in the wilderness or in small communities, and the order has almost no representatives in towns and cities. They are not opposed to civilization, however. Rather, they seek to prevent civilization and wilderness from harming one another. Those who serve the Emerald Enclave are masters of survival and living off the land, of navigating through the wilderness, and of reading the signs that indicate approaching weather, the passage of creatures, and the general weal of the natural world.": "绿宝石飞地致力于维护自然秩序的平衡，打击威胁这种平衡的力量。飞地的成员生活在荒野或小型社区，该组织在城镇几乎没有代表。然而，他们并不反对文明。相反，他们寻求防止文明和荒野相互伤害。那些为绿宝石飞地服务的人是生存和靠土地生活的大师，是在荒野中航行的大师，是读懂预示着天气临近、生物通过以及自然界总体利益的迹象的大师。",
	"Severin's plan to release Tiamat from the Nine Hells represents a grave threat to the natural order. The Dragon Queen's reign and the ascendancy of chromatic dragons would trigger a continent-wide catastrophe that the Emerald Enclave cannot allow.": "塞弗林从九层地狱释放提亚马特的计划对自然秩序构成了严重威胁。龙后的统治和色龙的上位将引发整个大陆的灾难，这是翡翠飞地所不允许的。",
	"Members of the Emerald Enclave operate alone or in small groups. Their primary focus is places where the natural world and civilization intersect, because that's where the natural order is most easily upset. Humanoids and monsters alike can become a threat to nature when they are thrown out of balance with their environment or their role in the world.": "绿宝石飞地的成员单独或以小团体形式行动。他们主要关注的是自然界和文明交汇的地方，因为那是自然秩序最容易被破坏的地方。当人类和怪物与他们的环境或他们在世界中的角色失去平衡时，它们都会成为自然的威胁。",
	"Whenever characters are traveling through the wilderness—and especially if they get into trouble in a remote area—they can encounter agents of the Emerald Enclave. If the adventurers need someone to guide them safely across a mountain range or lead them through trackless, monster-infested forest, there is no better choice than a member of the order.": "每当人物在野外旅行时--尤其是在偏远地区遇到麻烦时，他们都可能遇到翡翠飞地的代理人。如果冒险者需要有人引导他们安全穿越山脉，或者带领他们穿越无路可走、怪物横行的森林，那么没有比骑士团的成员更好的选择了。",
	"Druids, rangers, and barbarians make up most of the Emerald Enclave, but any character with a strong affinity for nature can find a place in the order.": "德鲁伊、游侠和野蛮人构成了翡翠飞地的大部分成员，但任何对自然有强烈亲和力的角色都能在秩序中找到一席之地。",
	"Delaan has come to the Council of Waterdeep as the lone representative of the Emerald Enclave. Even his regular companion, a winter wolf named Loska, remains on patrol outside the city. Delaan spends much of his time wandering the northern wilderness, and although he visits friends in Nesmé once a year, he otherwise shies away from large settlements. He is clearly uncomfortable in Waterdeep.": "德兰作为翡翠飞地的唯一代表来到水底世界的议会。甚至他的固定伙伴，一只名叫洛斯卡的冬狼，也仍然在城外巡逻。德拉恩大部分时间都在北方的荒野上游荡，虽然他每年都会去拜访内斯梅的朋友，但除此之外，他对大型定居点避之不及。他在沃特迪普显然是不舒服的。",
	"There is no question that Tiamat must be stopped, but the Emerald Enclave wants to see the world restored to order. This sometimes means taking a middle ground in battles between good and evil. Delaan is acutely aware of the destruction accompanying the recent activities of the Cult of the Dragon. He knows the cult must be destroyed for upsetting the balance of nature, and he knows that many dragons supporting the cult will die before the end. He would rather not kill unnecessarily, however.": "毫无疑问，提亚马特必须被阻止，但翡翠飞地希望看到世界恢复秩序。这有时意味着在善与恶的斗争中采取中间立场。德兰敏锐地意识到伴随着龙神教最近的活动而产生的破坏。他知道该邪教必须被摧毁，因为它破坏了自然界的平衡，而且他知道许多支持该邪教的龙会在结束前死去。然而，他宁愿不做无谓的杀戮。",
	"Delaan is initially reserved in his support of the party. To earn his respect, the characters must recognize that their battle is not just to save civilization but to preserve the natural order. He thus objects to many actions that good or neutral characters might not think twice about—including destroying chromatic dragon eggs and other acts that disrupt the natural cycle.": "Delaan最初对党的支持有所保留。为了赢得他的尊重，这些人物必须认识到他们的战斗不仅仅是为了拯救文明，而是为了保护自然秩序。因此，他反对许多善良或中立的角色可能不会考虑的行为--包括摧毁色龙蛋和其他破坏自然循环的行为。",
	"Delaan's oldest friend and mentor is a mighty treant named Turlang who resides in the High Forest. With Delaan's support, many treants will join the fight against Tiamat.": "Delaan最年长的朋友和导师是一个强大的树人，名叫Turlang，居住在高级森林中。在德拉安的支持下，许多树人将加入对抗提亚马特的战斗。",
	"\"The Lords' Alliance\" is not a metaphor. This organization was created and is led by leaders and nobles from across Faerûn. Although many of its members have conflicting goals and long-standing rivalries outside the alliance, they band together in the face of events that are too big for any of them to handle on their own. The rulers of Waterdeep, Silverymoon, Baldur's Gate, and other cities, families, and trading houses of the Sword Coast might never set aside their differences, but they can pull together when the survival of all depends on it.": "\"领主联盟 \"并不是一个比喻。这个组织是由来自法鲁恩各地的领袖和贵族创建并领导的。虽然它的许多成员在联盟之外有着相互冲突的目标和长期的竞争，但在面对他们中任何一个人都无法独立处理的大事件时，他们团结起来。水底城、银月城、博德之门以及剑海岸的其他城市、家族和商行的统治者们可能永远不会搁置他们的分歧，但当所有人的生存都取决于此时，他们可以团结起来。",
	"The Lords' Alliance represents the richest interests and the most powerful armies on the Sword Coast. The order controls wealth that can hire mercenaries, ensure the loyalty of wavering princes, and possibly even bribe a few chromatic dragons to switch sides or break from Tiamat's cause. Without the help of the alliance against the Cult of the Dragon, the Dragon Queen's victory might be assured.": "领主联盟代表了剑岸上最富有的利益集团和最强大的军队。该组织控制着财富，可以雇佣雇佣兵，确保动摇的王子们的忠诚，甚至可能贿赂一些色龙，让他们改换门庭或脱离提亚马特的事业。如果没有联盟对神龙教的帮助，龙后的胜利可能是有把握的。",
	"Even while they are working together, members of the Lords' Alliance are always advancing their own interests. Everyone knows and expects it—it's a fact of dealing with the alliance. That doesn't mean member cities don't cooperate and help each other in times of crisis. But if a crisis rearranges the power structure of the Sword Coast, all the players involved hope that the new order leaves them better off. For anyone to move up, someone else must move down.": "即使他们在一起工作，领主联盟的成员也总是在推进自己的利益。每个人都知道并期待着这一点--这是与联盟打交道的一个事实。这并不意味着成员城市在危机时不合作和互相帮助。但如果一场危机重新安排了剑海岸的权力结构，所有参与其中的人都希望新的秩序能让他们过得更好。任何人要向上发展，其他人就必须向下发展。",
	"Whenever a military campaign is underway, the Lords' Alliance is likely to be in command. Even if it isn't, alliance representatives will be on hand to observe and advise. If the characters find themselves in legal trouble, a councilor might come to the party's aid with a writ of pardon.": "每当有军事行动进行时，领主联盟很可能处于指挥地位。即使不是这样，联盟的代表也会在一旁观察并提供建议。如果角色们发现自己遇到了法律上的麻烦，一位议员可能会带着赦免令来帮助他们。",
	"Fighters and sorcerers are plentiful in the Lords' Alliance, but the order takes on any character who feels at home in civilized lands. Barbarians, rangers, and druids are seldom involved with this faction, which sometimes leads to strained relations with the Emerald Enclave.": "在领主联盟中，战士和巫师很多，但该组织也接受任何在文明土地上感到自在的角色。野蛮人、游侠和德鲁伊很少参与这个派别，这有时会导致与翡翠飞地的关系紧张。",
	"Because the Lords' Alliance is a confederation, the order sends seven delegates to the Council of Waterdeep, each effectively representing his or her own faction. Their diverse character, motivations, and obligations ensure that they are not in agreement about the current threat facing Faerûn. Moreover, the standing of certain delegates changes from one council to the next.": "由于领主联盟是一个联盟，该组织向水底城议会派出了七名代表，每个人都有效地代表自己的派系。他们的性格、动机和义务各不相同，这确保了他们对法鲁恩目前面临的威胁意见不一。此外，某些代表的地位在不同的议会中会发生变化。",
	"Although it is not necessary for all delegates to back the adventurers, without at least some support from the Lords' Alliance, there is almost no way for the party to marshal enough forces to win the day.": "虽然没有必要让所有代表都支持冒险家，但如果没有至少来自领主联盟的一些支持，该党几乎没有办法调集足够的力量来赢得这场比赛。",
	"Lady Laeral is present starting with the second council, at which point she becomes the Open Lord of Waterdeep. She is one of the Seven Sisters—legendary, nigh-immortal figures known to have been blessed by Mystra. (Some even say they are the goddess's daughters.) Her spellcasting ability is impressive but is beginning to wane, and she focuses more on political power than on the arcane these days. The Masked Lords of Waterdeep choose her as the successor to Dagult Neverember between the first and second sessions of the Council of Waterdeep, making her the leader of the Lords' Alliance.": "拉伊尔夫人从第二次议会开始出现，此时她成为水底世界的公开领主。她是七姐妹之一--传说中的、近乎不朽的人物，众所周知，她受到了神秘拉的祝福。(她的法术能力令人印象深刻，但已经开始减弱，而且她现在更关注政治权力而不是奥术。沃特德普的蒙面领主们在沃特德普议会第一届和第二届会议之间选择了她作为达古特-纽伦堡的继承人，使她成为领主联盟的领袖。",
	"Laeral Silverhand brings centuries of leadership experience and an impressive reputation to the negotiations. A consummate diplomat, she can wield words that wound or soothe with equal ease. As the Open Lord of Waterdeep, she holds great sway with all the delegates except Dagult Neverember, who believes that she engineered his removal from the position of Open Lord.": "Laeral Silverhand为谈判带来了几个世纪的领导经验和令人印象深刻的声誉。作为一个完美的外交家，她可以轻松地挥舞话语，使人受伤或舒缓。作为沃特德普的开放领主，她在所有的代表中都有很大的影响力，除了达古特-纽伦堡（Dagult Neverember），他认为是她策划了将他从开放领主的位置上撤下来。",
	"Laeral's primary concern is keeping all parties at the negotiating table, and making sure that concrete actions result from each council's discussions. However, she is leery of committing troops to battle. No stranger to the horrors of war, she is keenly aware that the lands represented by the Lords' Alliance need their soldiers for the protection of their own people. Only when convinced that the Cult of the Dragon is likely to succeed in summoning Tiamat does she change her mind. However, she doesn't trust the adventurers with leadership unless their deeds in the field and at the negotiating table have impressed her.": "拉伊尔的首要关注点是让所有各方都在谈判桌上，并确保每个理事会的讨论都能产生具体的行动。然而，她对派遣军队参加战斗持谨慎态度。她对战争的恐怖并不陌生，她敏锐地意识到，领主联盟所代表的土地需要他们的士兵来保护自己的人民。只有在确信神龙教有可能成功召唤提亚马特时，她才改变主意。然而，她并不信任冒险者的领导权，除非他们在战场上和谈判桌上的事迹让她印象深刻。",
	"If the adventurers sway Laeral to their side, she speaks highly of the party in the periods between council sessions. Having the support of the leader of the Lords' Alliance increases the party's stature in the eyes of all other factions, granting additional bonuses. See \"{@adventure Chapter 9: Council of Waterdeep|RoT|1}\" and the Council Scorecard ({@adventure appendix B|HotDQ|10}) for more information.": "如果冒险者将拉伊尔拉到自己一边，她就会在议会闭会期间对该党进行高度评价。得到领主联盟领袖的支持，会提高该党在所有其他派别眼中的地位，并给予额外的奖励。更多信息见\"{@adventure Chapter 9: Council of Waterdeep|RoT|1} \"和议会记分卡（{@adventure appendix B|HotDQ|10}）。",
	"Lord Neverember holds many titles and wears several crowns. During the first council, he is the Open Lord of Waterdeep, the Lord Protector of Neverwinter, and leader of the Lords' Alliance. He looks the part of such an impressively titled figure: tall and broad-shouldered, with a thick beard, a wild mane of hair, and a forceful manner. Rarely seen without his hand around a glass of strong spirits, he is a master manipulator and looks and behaves as a king should.": "永恒之城领主拥有许多头衔，戴着好几顶皇冠。在第一次议会中，他是水底世界的公开领主，永夜的保护者，以及领主联盟的领袖。他看起来就是这样一个令人印象深刻的头衔：高大宽阔的肩膀，浓密的胡须，狂野的头发，以及强硬的态度。他是一个操纵者，看起来和行为都是一个国王应该做的。",
	"Strong and decisive, Dagult acts always for the good of his subjects and realm—and in doing so, has consistently built up his own power and wealth. Unfortunately for him, the Masked Lords of Waterdeep have recently chosen to replace him as Open Lord. Laeral Silverhand, his successor, claims her title in the second council meeting.": "强大而果断的达古特总是为了他的臣民和王国的利益而行动--在这样做的过程中，他不断地建立起自己的权力和财富。不幸的是，沃特德普的蒙面领主们最近选择取代他成为开放领主。Laeral Silverhand，他的继任者，在第二次议会会议上声称她的头衔。",
	"Dagult demands order and rewards discipline, but he is pragmatic and driven by results above all else. He knows that nothing comes without effort, and sacrifices must be made when necessary. Tireless in his actions, he never stops until he has achieved his goals. He will use any means at his disposal, as long as those means are legally justifiable—even when such justification must be \"rediscovered\" from long-forgotten or ignored laws.": "达古特要求秩序，奖励纪律，但他是务实的，以结果为导向，高于一切。他知道没有什么是不劳而获的，必要时必须做出牺牲。他的行动不知疲倦，不达目的决不罢休。他将使用他所掌握的任何手段，只要这些手段在法律上是合理的--即使这种合理性必须从早已被遗忘或忽视的法律中 \"重新发现 \"出来。",
	"In the first council meeting, Lord Dagult's resources have been spread thin between the massive investments he's made in rebuilding Neverwinter and in maintaining dominance in Waterdeep. He strongly supports the members of the Lords' Alliance pooling resources, because he worries that neither of his investments can survive the coming catastrophe without assistance. This changes by the second council. Though losing Waterdeep allows him to consolidate his strength, Dagult resents Laeral for taking his position. He avoids letting his feelings cloud his judgment, however, intent on showing that he is a more fitting leader by backing the adventurers and taking a firm leadership role in the council.": "在第一次议会会议上，达古特领主在重建永夜城和维持沃特德普的统治方面进行了大量投资，他的资源已经被分散。他强烈支持领主联盟的成员集中资源，因为他担心如果没有援助，他的任何投资都无法在即将到来的灾难中生存。这种情况在第二次议会时有所改变。虽然失去沃特德普让他巩固了自己的实力，但达古特对拉伊尔抢走他的位置感到不满。然而，他避免让他的感情影响他的判断，而是打算通过支持冒险者和在议会中发挥坚定的领导作用来显示他是一个更合适的领导者。",
	"Son of Banak Brawnanvil and a former king of Mithral Hall, Connerad has made the long journey from Mithral Hall to act as the Lords' Alliance delegate for the dwarves of the North, including Citadel Adbar and Citadel Felbarr.": "康纳德是班纳克-布劳南威尔的儿子，也是米特拉尔厅的前国王，他从米特拉尔厅长途跋涉，担任领主联盟的代表，负责北方的矮人，包括阿德巴城和费尔巴城。",
	"Ulder Ravengard is the leader of the Flaming Fist—the military might of Baldur's Gate. He has the greatest martial acumen of anyone at the council (and probably in the whole Lords' Alliance). He can also muster more soldiers than any other delegate, and he is not bashful about saying so. His place is at the head of the war council and the front of the battle—but he will take that place only if the party proves worthy of his trust.": "Ulder Ravengard是火焰之拳的领袖--博德之门的军事力量。他是议会中最有军事头脑的人（可能也是整个领主联盟的人）。他还能召集比任何其他代表更多的士兵，而且他也不吝于这样说。他的位置是战争委员会的头，也是战斗的前线--但只有在当事人证明值得他信任的情况下，他才会占据这个位置。",
	"Ravengard is a stern warrior dedicated to discipline and results. Having risen through the ranks of the Flaming Fist by the might of his blade and the sharpness of his wits, he sometimes lacks sophistication and tact, but he possesses an unwavering commitment to the law. More comfortable working with soldiers than adventurers, Ravengard is used to giving orders and having them obeyed without question.": "拉文加德是一个致力于纪律和结果的严厉的战士。在火焰之拳的队伍中，他靠着刀剑的威力和智慧的敏锐度不断晋升，有时缺乏成熟和策略，但他拥有对法律坚定不移的承诺。与冒险者相比，拉文加德更喜欢与士兵一起工作，他习惯于下达命令并让他们毫无疑问地服从。",
	"Though Baldur's Gate is still recovering from the havoc caused by the resurrection within the city of Bhaal, god of murder, the metropolis remains one of Faerûn's most populous, wealthy, and powerful cities. Ravengard recognizes his duty to protect the city above all else, and the Flaming Fist's tired reserves are desperately needed for reconstruction and policing. However, he would love to see the Flaming Fist take a leading role in the fight against the Cult of the Dragon, if only to give the defenders of Baldur's Gate a stature befitting the greatest city in Faerûn. This opportunity for glory makes Ravengard receptive to the adventurers' overtures, as long as their plans and decisions promise stability and discipline.": "虽然博德之门仍在从谋杀之神巴尔的城市内的复活所造成的破坏中恢复，但这座大都市仍然是法鲁恩人口最多、最富裕、最强大的城市之一。拉文加德认识到他有责任保护这座城市，而火焰之拳的疲惫储备也亟需用于重建和维持治安。然而，他很想看到火焰之拳在与龙之崇拜的斗争中发挥主导作用，哪怕只是为了让博德之门的守卫者拥有与法鲁恩最伟大城市相称的地位。只要冒险者的计划和决定能保证稳定和纪律，这种荣耀的机会让拉文加德接受了冒险者的请求。",
	"The King of the Misty Forest is the delegate for the elves of both the Misty Forest and the High Forest. Whereas his sons Alagarthas and Neronvain always rushed headlong into their own pursuits, Melandrach is more circumspect. He has led the elves of the Misty Forest since before most of their kind abandoned their lands in the Retreat. Despite the years of discussion and meditation that preceded it, Melandrach considered the Retreat a rash decision, and he is understandably hesitant to commit to any sudden course of action.": "迷雾森林的国王是迷雾森林和高级森林的精灵的代表。他的儿子阿拉格萨斯和奈伦温总是一头扎进自己的追求中，而梅兰德斯则比较谨慎。他从大多数同类放弃他们的退路之前就开始领导迷雾森林的精灵们了。尽管之前经过多年的讨论和冥想，梅兰德斯认为撤退是一个轻率的决定，他对任何突然的行动方案都感到犹豫，这是可以理解的。",
	"During meetings of the council, Melandrach consistently argues for caution and more information, and nothing the adventurers say seems to make any difference. That changes when it is revealed that his lost son Neronvain has become the cult's Green Wyrmspeaker.": "在理事会的会议上，梅兰德斯一直主张谨慎行事和提供更多的信息，而冒险家们说什么似乎都不会有什么影响。当发现他丢失的儿子Neronvain已经成为邪教的绿色巫师时，情况发生了变化。",
	"Silverymoon has a large army and many wizards who would greatly assist in the coming battle, but Taern has not lived this long by being rash. He is one of the most cautious delegates, knowing that Silverymoon's great wards of protection have stood against dragons before. Fearing that committing soldiers to the effort against the Cult of the Dragon might leave the city weakened, Taern needs to know that the party will protect any troops he lends to the coalition. As such, he seeks to gather as much information as possible about the adventurers and other potential allies.": "银月有一支庞大的军队和许多巫师，他们会在即将到来的战斗中提供极大的帮助，但泰恩并不是因为轻率而活了这么久。他是最谨慎的代表之一，因为他知道银月城的巨大保护屏障以前曾抵御过龙。由于担心将士兵投入到对抗龙神教的工作中可能会使城市受到削弱，泰恩需要知道，党会保护他借给联盟的任何部队。因此，他试图尽可能多地收集关于冒险者和其他潜在盟友的信息。",
	"Sir Isteval is a former adventurer and Purple Dragon Knight of Cormyr. Though not an actual member of the Lords' Alliance, he is present at the Council of Waterdeep as the alliance's nominal representative for Daggerford. That small settlement can contribute little to the effort to defeat the Cult of the Dragon, however, and in truth, Isteval has been drafted by Cormyr to gain insight into what looks to be a war brewing on its western border.": "伊斯特瓦尔爵士是一位前冒险家和科米尔的紫龙骑士。虽然他不是领主联盟的实际成员，但他作为联盟名义上的达格福特代表出席了沃特德普的议会。然而，这个小定居点对击败龙之崇拜的努力贡献不大，事实上，伊斯特瓦尔被科米尔征召，以深入了解其西部边境上似乎正在酝酿的一场战争。",
	"Isteval has too much respect for the other delegates to hide this information from them, and he assures those present that his loyalties—to Daggerford, to Cormyr, to the Lords' Alliance, and to all good folk—are not at cross-purposes. This forthright approach nevertheless causes an uproar among other delegates, and the adventurers must take a hand in insuring that Isteval is not expelled from the council meetings.": "伊斯特瓦尔非常尊重其他代表，不会对他们隐瞒这些信息，他向在场的人保证，他对达格福特、科米尔、领主联盟和所有善良的人们的忠诚并不相悖。但这种直截了当的做法还是在其他代表中引起了骚动，冒险家们必须参与其中，以确保伊斯特瓦尔不被驱逐出议会会议。",
	"A veteran dragon slayer, Isteval bears a wound in his leg that resists magical healing, and he walks with a cane made from a bone of the green dragon that dealt him the injury. The paladin can be a helpful source of dragon lore, but his advice is always guarded. He sees his infirmity as a reminder from his god Lathander of the dangers of hubris. As befits his deity's ethos, Isteval has chosen to treat his injury as a reason to encourage the heroics of others even as his own legend fades. Still, at times like these when the world needs heroes, he doesn't like being reminded that he must watch the fight from the sidelines.": "作为一名资深的屠龙者，伊斯特瓦尔的腿上有一道伤口，可以抵抗魔法的治疗，他用一根绿龙的骨头做成的手杖行走。这位圣骑士可以成为龙的传说的有用来源，但他的建议总是受到保护。他认为自己的虚弱是他的神Lathander对傲慢的危险的一种提醒。与他的神的精神相称，伊斯特瓦尔选择把他的伤痛当作鼓励他人的英雄事迹的理由，即使他自己的传说已经消失。不过，在这种世界需要英雄的时候，他并不喜欢被提醒他必须在一旁观战。",
	"Isteval believes in heroes as the spark that can ignite the flames of righteousness in others and the light that chases away the darkness of evil. Seeing this spark in the adventurers makes the paladin one of the party's strongest advocates at the Council of Waterdeep, as long as they pursue a principled path.": "伊斯特瓦尔相信英雄是能够点燃他人正义之火的火花，是驱赶邪恶黑暗的光芒。看到冒险者身上的这种火花，使圣骑士成为党在沃特德普议会最有力的支持者之一，只要他们追求有原则的道路。",
	"The Zhentarim—also known as the Black Network—is a loose affiliation of merchants, mercenaries, and malefactors. Common folk know the Zhentarim as the people to talk to when you need the best guards or mercenaries money can buy. And if the cargo is shady or the cause you're fighting for is questionable or even unjust, the Zhentarim don't mind.": "Zhentarim--也被称为黑网--是一个由商人、雇佣兵和恶棍组成的松散联盟。普通人都知道，当你需要用钱买到最好的警卫或雇佣兵时，可以和Zhentarim谈谈。如果货物有问题，或者你为之奋斗的事业有问题，甚至是不公正的，Zhentarim也不会介意。",
	"Affiliation with the Zhentarim can be profitable to sellswords, thieves, and rogues of every stripe. It's plausible that adventurers in your campaign might become members of the organization—but like most residents of Faerûn, they won't know the full extent of the Zhentarim's operations and goals.": "隶属于Zhentarim的组织对各种类型的卖家、盗贼和流氓来说都是有利可图的。在你的活动中，冒险者有可能成为该组织的成员，但就像法鲁恩的大多数居民一样，他们并不了解Zhentarim的全部活动和目标。",
	"Unknown to all but a few, the heart of the Zhentarim is a cabal of evil and sometimes monstrous leaders who seek to extend the Black Network's blood-soaked reach into every assassination, black market, and illegal deal that happens in Faerûn. The order's criminal connections burrow into every major city and thieves' guild in the Western Heartlands and along the Sword Coast. Wherever a city's coinage is disastrously undermined by counterfeiting, wherever an up-and-coming business runs roughshod over its established competitors, and wherever a political struggle turns to widespread intimidation, it's a safe bet that the Zhentarim are involved.": "除了少数人之外，根塔林的核心是一个由邪恶的、有时是畸形的领导人组成的阴谋集团，他们试图将黑色网络的血腥触角延伸到法鲁恩的每一次暗杀、黑市和非法交易中。该组织的犯罪关系深入到西部心脏地带和剑海岸的每个主要城市和盗贼公会。每当一个城市的钱币因造假而遭到灾难性破坏，每当一个新兴企业对其成熟的竞争对手采取粗暴手段，每当一场政治斗争演变成广泛的恐吓，都可以肯定根塔林会参与其中。",
	"However, engaging in mainstream corruption and wanting to see Tiamat ascendant are two different things. The Zhentarim have no illusions about what the Dragon Queen's return would mean for their plans. Wanting to secretly rule the world from the shadows for themselves, the leaders of the Black Network have no desire to become agents and errand-runners for some petty god and her dragon cohorts.": "然而，参与主流腐败和希望看到提亚马特登基是两件事。镇塔林对龙女王的回归对他们的计划意味着什么不抱幻想。想要从阴影中为自己秘密统治世界，黑网的领导人并不希望成为某个小神和她的龙族同伙的代理人和跑腿者。",
	"This viewpoint makes the Zhentarim an interesting addition to the characters' possible allies. Under normal circumstances, the Harpers, the Lords' Alliance, the Order of the Gauntlet, and the Emerald Enclave would shun ties to the Black Network—and possibly arrest its emissaries. However, the crisis created by the Cult of the Dragon is unprecedented. Every resource that can be mustered will be needed in the final showdown against the cult, and the Zhentarim's network of spies, assassins, and mercenary armies cannot be ignored.": "这种观点使赞塔林成为人物可能的盟友中一个有趣的补充。在正常情况下，哈珀人（Harpers）、领主联盟（Lords' Alliance）、高塔骑士团（Order of the Gauntlet）和翡翠飞地（Emerald Enclave）会回避与黑网的关系，并可能逮捕其使者。然而，神龙教造成的危机是空前的。在与该邪教的最后决战中，将需要每一种可以调动的资源，而镇塔林的间谍、刺客和雇佣军网络是不容忽视的。",
	"Even with the fate of the world and the Zhentarim's own future hanging in the balance, the order demands payment for services—and where need and risk are greatest, the pay is expected to be equally great. This mercenary attitude does not sit well with the Lords' Alliance, however, and they are the only group with the resources to pay the Black Network's price. The heroes can attempt to sway the opinions of the other factions—and have a chance to buy the Zhentarim's allegiance outright in the follow-up to {@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}.": "即使世界的命运和Zhentarim自己的未来都岌岌可危，该组织仍要求为服务付费--在需求和风险最大的地方，报酬也会同样巨大。然而，这种雇佣兵的态度让领主联盟很不满意，他们是唯一有资源来支付黑网代价的团体。英雄们可以尝试动摇其他派别的意见--并且有机会在后续的{@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}中直接买下赞塔林的效忠。",
	"In the end, too much is at stake to sit this fight out, and the Zhentarim pitch in against the cult regardless of whether their price is paid. However, if the other factions want a voice in how the Zhentarim go to war against the cult, it will cost them. If the Zhentarim fight on their own, they strike when and how they choose.": "最后，这场战斗的利害关系太大了，无论是否付出代价，Zhentarim都会投向邪教。然而，如果其他派别想在根塔林人如何与邪教开战的问题上有发言权，他们就会付出代价。如果Zhentarim独立作战，他们会在自己选择的时间和方式上进行打击。",
	"At least one Black Network mission is carried out regardless of payment. Without the knowledge of anyone outside the Zhentarim, one of their agents has infiltrated the cult and gets close enough to Wyrmspeaker Varram to steal the {@i White Dragon Mask}. This theft sets off a sequence of events that culminates in Varram's portion of the \"{@adventure Death to the Wyrmspeakers|RoT|3}\" chapter.": "至少有一个黑网的任务是不计报酬地执行的。在镇塔林以外的人不知情的情况下，他们的一名特工潜入了邪教，并接近了Wyrmspeaker Varram，偷走了{@i White Dragon Mask}。这次偷窃引发了一连串的事件，在瓦拉姆的\"{@adventure Death to the Wyrmspeakers|RoT|3} \"章节中达到高潮。",
	"A typical Black Network agent is a highly capable adventurer with no scruples. Some Zhentarim have winged snake companions that carry messages on scrolls as they fly, allowing agents to keep in contact with one another.": "一个典型的黑网特工是一个能力很强的冒险家，没有任何顾忌。一些真塔林人有带翅膀的蛇伙伴，它们在飞行时将信息写在卷轴上，使特工们能够保持彼此的联系。",
	"Although the Zhentarim as a whole oppose the cult's plans, not everyone in the Black Network shares that view. A number of Zhentarim agents believe that the cult's victory is inevitable, and that by standing against the cult, the Zhentarim risk losing everything. If events are going too smoothly for the heroes, you can introduce a few rogue Black Network agents to throw a wrench into the characters' plans at the worst possible moment.": "虽然根塔林作为一个整体反对邪教的计划，但在黑色网络中并不是每个人都赞同这种观点。一些Zhentarim特工认为，邪教的胜利是不可避免的，如果站在邪教的对立面，Zhentarim有可能失去一切。如果事件对英雄们来说太顺利了，你可以引入几个流氓黑网特工，在最糟糕的时刻给人物的计划带来麻烦。",
	"Rian is a member of the Zhentarim and the Black Network's envoy during the third Council of Waterdeep. She is seated at the table as a special adviser to Lord Neverember, and her affiliation with the Zhentarim will not be mentioned. However, neither she nor Lord Neverember try to deny or conceal that affiliation if the characters question why Rian is present.": "里安是根塔林的成员，也是黑网在第三届沃特德普议会中的特使。她作为纽文伯领主的特别顾问坐在会议桌前，她与根塔林的关系不会被提及。然而，如果角色们质疑里安的存在，她和纽文伯领主都不会试图否认或隐瞒这种关系。",
	"The Black Network backs any plans that increase the likelihood of defeating the cult. Any and all alliances are fine, as are any outcomes that add to the council's strategic resources. Rian doesn't have any particular interest in morality, and dark acts have no impact on her attitude toward the party. She disapproves of taking any wyrmspeakers alive, though, fearing the power of such dangerous figures and questioning the chance of success for attempts to turn or interrogate them. She favors discreet execution, interrogation of the corpse with appropriate rituals, and destruction of the body to prevent resurrection.": "黑网支持任何增加击败邪教的可能性的计划。任何和所有的联盟都没有问题，任何能增加理事会战略资源的结果也是如此。里安对道德没有任何特别的兴趣，黑暗行为对她对党的态度没有任何影响。但她不赞成活捉任何讲巫术的人，因为她害怕这种危险人物的力量，并对试图策反或审讯他们的成功率表示怀疑。她倾向于谨慎地处决，用适当的仪式审问尸体，并销毁尸体以防止复活。",
	"The Black Network remains uncommitted until the final council when pledges are made. If the party has earned the Zhentarim's respect, they provide their services at only a nominal cost. However, such action almost certainly alienates most of the other factions from the adventurers. Unlike the other factions, the Zhentarim's loyalty can be purchased regardless of their respect for the characters, if the party can negotiate terms to be paid by the other factions.": "黑网在最后的议会上作出承诺之前，一直没有作出承诺。如果队伍赢得了赞塔林的尊重，他们只需付出象征性的代价就能提供服务。然而，这样的行动几乎肯定会使大多数其他派系与冒险者疏远。与其他派别不同的是，不管他们对角色的尊重程度如何，如果党派能够谈判出由其他派别支付的条件，那么就可以买到Zhentarim的忠诚度。",
	"The good dragons of Faerûn hear the {@i Draakhorn's} call and know what it portends. With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, the good dragons will take action to oppose the return of Tiamat. However, it remains to be seen whether they do so in concert with the humanoid factions of the Sword Coast, or whether they strike on their own with no thought or concern for the fate of the lesser races.": "法鲁恩的好龙们听到了{@i Draakhorn's}的召唤，知道它预示着什么。由于世界的命运悬而未决，好龙们将采取行动，反对提亚马特的回归。然而，他们是与剑海岸的人形派别协同作战，还是不顾较小种族的命运独自出击，还有待观察。",
	"Though many giants have thrown their lot in with the Cult of the Dragon, most remember the ancient dragon-giant wars with bitterness and hatred. Tales of feuds, bloodletting, and death fuel the giants' hatred of dragons, but the giant races are their own masters. As such, they don't easily cooperate with the small races. Even when good giants see the need and wisdom in joining forces with lesser folk, they often resist the idea out of pride until someone or something can command their respect.": "虽然很多巨人都投靠了龙之教，但大多数人对古代龙-巨人战争的记忆是痛苦和仇恨的。关于仇杀、流血和死亡的故事加剧了巨人对龙的仇恨，但巨人种族是他们自己的主人。因此，他们不轻易与小种族合作。即使善良的巨人看到了与小民族联合的必要性和智慧，他们也常常出于骄傲而抵制这种想法，直到有人或事能得到他们的尊重。",
	"Engaging the giants in an alliance against the Cult of the Dragon can be handled by NPCs (most likely by members of the Harpers or the Emerald Enclave). If the characters completed {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} in possession of Skyreach Castle, offering to return it to the giants (either behind the scenes or in a side trek chapter of your own creation) is sure to guarantee their support of the factions against the Cult of the Dragon. The presence of giants at the final showdown will be an enormous advantage for the forces fighting against the cult.": "与巨人结盟对抗龙之崇拜，可以由NPC处理（很可能是哈珀斯或翡翠飞地的成员）。如果人物完成了{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}拥有Skyreach城堡，提出把它还给巨人（无论是在幕后还是在你自己创造的侧面跋涉章节），肯定会保证他们支持各派别对抗龙神教。巨人出现在最后的决战中，将是对抗邪教的部队的一个巨大优势。",
	"The town of Greenest was founded by the halfling Dharva Scatterheart, a rogue who fancied herself the queen of the Greenfields. Scatterheart passed away without ever achieving that level of eminence, but her town grew into a thriving community. Its success isn't surprising, since Greenest is the only town of any size astride the Uldoon Trail, the most direct road between the eastern cities of the Dragon Coast, Cormyr, and Sembia with the Coast Way running south to the great cities of Amn, Tethyr, and far Calimshan. The trade caravans that pass through Greenest bring gold to the town's merchants and craftsfolk, and Governor Nighthill runs the town at the behest of the inhabitants.": "绿地镇是由半身人达瓦-散心（Dharva Scatterheart）建立的，她是一个流氓，自认为是绿地的女王。散心没有达到那个水平就去世了，但她的镇子却发展成一个繁荣的社区。它的成功并不令人惊讶，因为格林斯特是唯一位于乌尔敦小道上的大小城镇，乌尔敦小道是连接龙之海岸东部城市、科米尔和森比亚的最直接道路，海岸之路向南延伸至安恩、泰特希尔和遥远的卡林山等伟大城市。经过格林斯特的贸易商队为镇上的商人和手工业者带来了黄金，总督奈特希尔根据居民的要求管理这个镇。",
	"The adventurers might be on the road from one town to another or returning to their homes after a trip away. Alternatively, they could be accompanying a merchant or wealthy traveler as bodyguards. Many restless young people of Faerûn have had their first taste of travel and adventure as caravan guards.": "冒险家们可能正在从一个城镇到另一个城镇的路上，或者在外出旅行后回到自己的家。另外，他们也可能是作为保镖陪伴商人或富有的旅行者。法鲁恩的许多不安分的年轻人第一次尝到了作为商队护卫的旅行和冒险的滋味。",

	"For the past several days, you have been traveling a road that winds lazily across the rolling grasslands of the Greenfields. Sundown is approaching when you top a rise and see the town of Greenest just a few short miles away.

Greenest is being attacked by a dragon!": "在过去的几天里，你一直行驶在一条公路上，这条公路懒洋洋地蜿蜒在绿原地区起伏的草地上。日落时分，当你登上一个高地，看到短短几英里外的格林斯特镇时。但是，你看到的不是你所期望的那个愉快的、热情的小镇，而是从燃烧的建筑物中升起的黑烟柱，在这个距离上，奔跑的身影不过是一些小点，还有一个黑暗的、有翅膀的形状在镇中心上方的堡垒上低空旋转。格林斯特被一条龙攻击了！\"。",

	"The cultists tried to set buildings ablaze as they moved through town, but thatch isn't as flammable as it looks. When characters arrive, most of the flames come from haystacks and barns, not from homes or shops.": "邪教分子在穿过城镇时试图放火烧毁建筑物，但茅草并不像它看起来那样易燃。当人物到达时，大部分的火焰来自干草堆和谷仓，而不是来自住宅或商店。",
	"The stream that flows past Greenest is shallow (seldom more than 3 feet deep) with a gravel bottom, so characters can move along it without difficulty. Where the banks are clear, the stream is easy to get into or out of. Brush by the stream is dense, and the banks are steep where brush grows. Characters can move only 5 feet per turn through the brush.": "流经格林斯特的溪流很浅（很少超过3英尺深），底部有碎石，所以人物可以毫不费力地沿着它移动。在岸边清澈的地方，溪流很容易进入或离开。溪流边的灌木很密集，岸边灌木丛生的地方很陡峭。人物每回合只能在灌木丛中移动5英尺。",
	"The man who runs Greenest is Tarbaw Nighthill, a human male of sixty years. If characters ask who's in charge, they are directed to Nighthill. He is pacing atop the parapet of the keep when the sky is clear, or inside the keep if the dragon is attacking. If the characters don't seek out the governor when they reach the keep, he finds them.

	"Events in Greenest are divided into missions. Missions don't need to involve combat, but most do.": "在《最绿》中，事件被分为任务。任务不需要涉及战斗，但大多数都涉及。",
	"The characters reach the town at sundown, or about 9 p.m. The sun comes up again at 6 a.m. the next morning, but the last of the raiders are gone by 4 a.m.": "角色们在日落时分，也就是晚上9点左右到达小镇。第二天早上6点，太阳再次升起，但最后一批突袭者在凌晨4点前就走了。",
	"For time-keeping purposes, assume that each mission takes an hour. Time during the hour that isn't spent fighting or slipping through town is spent tending gear, bandaging minor wounds, patrolling the keep's walls, briefing Nighthill on the situation, and other mundane tasks. If characters take a short rest, they can't undertake any other mission that hour.": "为了记录时间，假设每次任务需要一个小时。在这一小时内，如果不是用于战斗或溜过城镇，就会用于照料装备、包扎小伤口、在堡垒的墙壁上巡逻、向奈特希尔介绍情况，以及其他平凡的任务。如果角色进行短暂的休息，他们就不能在那一小时内承担任何其他任务。",
	"If players need guidance, Governor Nighthill can give the characters a quick briefing on the tactical situation. The raiders have isolated the keep from the town with encircling groups of guards, but they haven't organized an attack. Nighthill thinks the raiders don't intend to attack the keep; they seem interested only in loot. The real danger is to the town and to those people who didn't make it into the keep before it was cut off. Nighthill wants the characters to slip back into the town and help people who are cut off or harass the raiders. A stealthy group can make it out of the keep and back in again without drawing the raiders' attention.": "如果玩家需要指导，奈特希尔总督可以给人物快速介绍一下战术情况。袭击者已经用包围的卫兵群将堡垒与城镇隔离开来，但他们还没有组织进攻。Nighthill认为突袭者并不打算攻击堡垒；他们似乎只对战利品感兴趣。真正的危险是对镇子和那些在被切断之前没能进入堡垒的人。Nighthill希望角色们能溜回镇上，帮助那些被切断的人或骚扰突袭者。一个隐蔽的团队可以在不引起突袭者注意的情况下，走出堡垒并再次返回。",
	"A narrow tunnel runs from the cellar beneath the keep to the bank of the stream (area 2). The tunnel is wide enough to allow warriors to pass through it in single file. In the keep, the tunnel is sealed with a locked ironbound door, and the stream exit is covered with a locked iron grate made to look like a sewer outlet. The tunnel's main function was as a secret means of collecting water from the stream during a siege, but it can double as a sally port. Since the keep has never been besieged, the old tunnel has never been used. Barrels and crates are piled in front of the door. The keys for the locks are on the ring that Escobert carries with him everywhere.": "一条狭窄的隧道从堡垒下面的地窖一直延伸到溪流的岸边（2区）。这条隧道足够宽，可以让战士们单枪匹马地通过。在堡垒里，隧道被一扇上了锁的铁门封住，而溪流的出口则被一个上了锁的铁栅栏覆盖，看起来就像一个下水道的出口。这条隧道的主要功能是在围攻期间从溪流中收集水的秘密手段，但它也可以作为集水口。由于该堡垒从未被围攻过，所以这条老隧道也从未被使用过。桶和板条箱堆在门前。锁的钥匙在埃斯科贝特随处携带的戒指上。",
	"At some point, Escobert recommends the tunnel as a means of sneaking townsfolk into the keep without running the gauntlet of attackers watching the gates.": "在某种程度上，埃斯科贝特建议将隧道作为一种手段，让镇民们偷偷进入堡垒，而不需要跑到看守大门的攻击者面前。",
	"Years of exposure and neglect have corroded the lock on the exit grate. Even with the key, a successful DC 10 Dexterity check is needed to open the lock. Without the key, the DC increases to 20. If the roll misses by 5 or more, the key or {@item thieves' tools|PHB} break off in the lock so that unlocking it becomes impossible. Then only a successful DC 15 Strength check can force the grate open.": "多年的暴露和忽视使出口栅栏上的锁被腐蚀了。即使有钥匙，要打开这把锁也需要成功的DC10灵巧检查。如果没有钥匙，DC会增加到20。如果检查结果差5分或更多，钥匙或{@item thieves' tools|PHB}在锁中断裂，这样就无法开锁了。然后，只有成功地进行DC15力量检查才能强行打开栅栏。",
	"Award standard XP for defeated foes. Aside from that, the chief reward for this mission is the tunnel itself. As long as it remains secret, characters can use it to enter and exit the keep safely. Each time they use the tunnel exit, roll a {@dice d6}. On a 1, raiders see and attack the characters (use the {@area Chapter 1 Encounters|06e|x} table). On a 2, they are seen but not attacked. Instead, the raiders set an ambush and attack the next time the characters return to the tunnel exit.": "为被击败的敌人奖励标准XP。除此以外，这个任务的主要奖励是隧道本身。只要它保持秘密，人物就可以用它来安全地进入和离开城堡。每次他们使用地道出口时，都要掷出{@dice d6}。如果是1，突击队员会看到并攻击他们（使用{@area Chapter 1 Encounters|06e|x}表）。如果是2，他们会被看到，但不会被攻击。相反，突袭者会设下埋伏，在人物下次返回隧道出口时发动攻击。",
	"The keep has a sally port along the west wall for counterattacking foes who bring a battering ram against the gates. During the night while characters are in the keep, raiders approach the old gate, force it open, and rush through. Escobert discovers them and races into the courtyard to sound the alarm ahead of the infiltrators.": "堡垒的西墙有一个紧急通道，用于反击那些用撞锤撞门的敌人。夜里，当人物在堡垒中时，突袭者接近老门，强行打开，然后冲了进去。埃斯科贝尔发现了他们，并跑到院子里，在潜入者面前拉响了警报。",
	"Enough defenders are available to deal with the immediate threat from raiders loose in the keep, since it's more a probe that got out of hand rather than a full-scale assault. Escobert is most concerned about resealing the sally port, and he seeks out the characters for that job.": "有足够的守卫者来处理来自守卫中松散的袭击者的直接威胁，因为这更像是一次失控的探测，而不是一次全面的攻击。埃斯科贝特最关心的是重新密封集散港，他找来了负责这项工作的人物。",
	"Award standard XP for defeated foes.": "为被打败的敌人奖励标准XP。",
	"The {@creature adult blue dragon} Lennithon accompanied this raid but is not an enthusiastic participant. Its chief contribution has been its Frightful Presence, but that becomes less effective as the night wears on and defenders overcome their fear. Shortly before midnight, the dragon launches a final assault against the citadel. {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ} orders the attack, knowing that the adventurers are in the keep at the time. Lennithon doesn't consider this to be its fight, and it isn't keen on tangling with adventurers for another's benefit.": "Lennithon{@creature adult blue dragon}伴随着这次突袭，但并不是一个热情的参与者。它的主要贡献是其可怕的存在，但随着夜幕的降临和守卫者克服恐惧，这一点变得不那么有效。午夜前不久，巨龙对城堡发起了最后的攻击。{@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}下令进攻，他知道当时冒险者们都在堡垒里。伦尼森不认为这是它的战斗，它不热衷于为了别人的利益与冒险者纠缠。",
	"During this attack, Lennithon flies over the keep and uses his breath weapon without moving closer than 25 feet from the parapet. The defenders on the walls have mastered their fear of the dragon's Frightful Presence from earlier attacks. There are twenty NPC defenders on the walls at the beginning of the mission, and more can arrive between attacks to take the place of those who fall. The dragon doesn't target the adventures at first, and every breath attack not directed at them kills {@dice 1d4} NPC defenders and injures {@dice 1d6} more. Adventurers who happen to get caught in the area make normal saving throws and take standard damage. The NPCs' attacks are ineffective against Lennithon. Bear in mind that the dragon's breath weapon will kill a 1st-level character outright, so be sure to demonstrate its destructive power to the players before turning the dragon against the party.": "在这次攻击中，伦尼森飞到了守卫的上空，使用他的呼吸武器，而不靠近护栏25英尺。城墙上的守卫者在先前的攻击中已经掌握了对龙的可怕存在的恐惧。在任务开始时，城墙上有20名NPC守卫者，在攻击间隙，会有更多的人来到城墙上，取代那些倒下的人的位置。巨龙一开始并不以冒险者为目标，每一次不是针对他们的呼吸攻击都会杀死{@dice 1d4}NPC守卫者，并伤害{@dice 1d6}更多。碰巧被卷入该区域的冒险者进行正常的蓄力攻击，并受到标准伤害。NPC的攻击对Lennithon是无效的。请记住，龙的呼吸武器会直接杀死一个一级角色，所以在让龙对抗队伍之前，一定要向玩家展示其破坏力。",
	"After each attack, Lennithon swoops away until his breath weapon recharges, then swings in for another attack. He repeats this pattern until it has taken 24 damage or more, or a single critical hit. After that happens, Lennithon leaves for good.": "每次攻击后，伦尼森都会俯冲而下，直到他的呼吸武器充能，然后再挥拳攻击。他重复这一模式，直到造成24次或更多的伤害，或出现一次关键打击。在这之后，伦尼森就永远离开了。",
	"Governor Nighthill would like to interrogate some of the raiders.": "奈特希尔总督想审问一些突击队员。",

	"If the characters haven't run into any cult leaders yet, Nighthill takes them onto the parapet and points out what he means. This is an ideal time for everyone to catch a glimpse of {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}) in her purple robes, accompanied by a dozen guards. Even the governor cautions characters against attacking such a formidable force, especially when any lower-level officer can answer his questions.": "如果角色们还没有碰到任何邪教领袖，奈特希尔就把他们带到护栏上，指出他的意思。这是一个理想的时机，让大家看到穿着紫袍的{@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}（见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}），在十几个卫兵的陪同下。即使是总督也告诫人物不要攻击这样一支强大的力量，尤其是当任何低级别的官员都能回答他的问题时。",
	"Leaving the keep through the front gate is out of the question—too many raiders watch it, and they would jump the characters as soon as they moved away from the keep. Other options are waiting for a cloud to cover the moon before climbing down ropes tossed over the back wall of the keep, or using the old tunnel that exits into the stream bed.": "从正门离开堡垒是不可能的--有太多的突击队员在监视着，而且一旦他们离开堡垒，就会扑向这些人物。其他选择是等待云层遮住月亮，然后从扔在堡垒后墙上的绳索上爬下来，或者使用进入河床的旧隧道。",
	"This mission can be combined with another mission, such as saving the mill or rescuing villagers from the temple of Chauntea (area 3).

A few fires are burning around the building, but they could be extinguished easily.": "在{@area Chapter 1 Encounters|06e|x}表上掷出{@dice d6}，以确定试图放火烧厂的突击队员的力量。一旦有两个或更多的突击队员被杀，这支队伍中的任何哥布林就会跑掉。如果角色在攻击前观察磨坊一分钟或更长时间，允许他们尝试DC15智慧（{@skill Insight}）或魅力（{@skill Performance}）检查。如果成功，角色就会意识到，突击队员正在做起火的示范，但这只是为了表演。建筑物周围有一些火在燃烧，但它们很容易被扑灭。",

	"The mill is a simple rectangular barn, about 40 feet long and 20 feet wide, with an attached, exterior office. The long side of the building away from the stream has barn doors and a two-part door, and the two short walls have windows. All these openings are closed, but none are locked or barred. Inside, the main floor is dominated by a massive stone grinding wheel driven by a water wheel in the stream. The mill was operating late when the raid began and the millers fled without disengaging the wheel, so it still turns noisily. The upper half of the barn is a loft where milled flour is stored. The loft can be reached by wooden stairs along the east wall or by using the ropes and pulleys that hoist bags of flour up and down through large openings in the loft floor.": "磨坊是一个简单的长方形谷仓，大约40英尺长，20英尺宽，有一个附属的外部办公室。建筑物远离河流的长边有谷仓门和一个两扇门，两面短墙有窗户。所有这些开口都是封闭的，但没有一个是锁着或闩着的。在里面，主楼的主体是一个巨大的石磨，由溪流中的水轮驱动。袭击开始时，磨坊正在晚间运作，磨坊主没有解除水轮就逃走了，所以它仍然在嘈杂地转动。谷仓的上半部分是一个阁楼，存放着磨好的面粉。阁楼可以通过沿东墙的木质楼梯到达，或者利用绳索和滑轮将一袋袋面粉从阁楼地板上的大开口处吊上去和吊下来。",
	"The ambushers are waiting in the loft for heroes to enter the mill. When the heroes are inside, the guards launch a volley of spears from above, then leap down to fight hand-to-hand. The ambushers have a good chance to gain a surprise round for their spear volley; a successful DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check is needed to notice them before the attack. Characters who scan the loft for hidden enemies upon entering the mill have advantage on the check.": "伏击者在阁楼上等待着英雄们进入磨坊。当英雄们进入磨坊时，守卫们从上面发射一排长矛，然后跳下来与人交手。伏击者有很好的机会为他们的长矛射击获得一个突击回合；在攻击之前，需要成功地进行DC20智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查以注意到他们。在进入磨坊时扫描阁楼以寻找隐藏的敌人的角色在检查上有优势。",

They tell the characters to go back to the keep quietly while they remain behind at the mill.": "第二场战斗结束后10分钟，十几个血淋淋但基本健康的守卫者从堡垒里赶来，命令他们解救人物并保卫磨坊。他们让角色们悄悄地回到堡垒，而他们则留在磨坊里。",

	"The temple is a large building, made of fieldstone with a peaked slate roof, and square in shape. It is taller than most other buildings in town. Inside, the altar occupies the middle of the temple, with other worship areas arranged around it.": "该寺庙是一座大型建筑，由田园石制成，有一个尖顶石板屋顶，呈正方形。它比镇上的大多数其他建筑都要高。在里面，祭坛占据了寺庙的中间位置，其他崇拜区域则围绕着它排列。",
	"The force outside the temple is split into three groups. One (A) is battering at the front doors, another (B) is circling the temple in a screeching mob, and the third (C) is heaping burning straw against a rear door. All these groups together would overwhelm 1st-level characters, but characters can devise a plan that gets them inside the temple by dealing with one group.": "寺庙外的力量分成三组。一组（A）正在冲击前门，另一组（B）正围着寺庙尖叫着，第三组（C）正用燃烧的稻草堆着后门。所有这些团体加起来会压倒第一级的人物，但是人物可以制定一个计划，通过对付一个团体使他们进入寺庙。",
	"Group C consists of four {@creature Cultist||cultists} and four {@creature Kobold||kobolds} clustered tightly around the temple's back door. Their meager fire produces little flame, instead creating prodigious clouds of thick smoke that engulf the back of the temple and blanket the surrounding 30 feet of ground. Everything in the smoke is lightly obscured, and objects or creatures that are seen through more than 15 feet of smoke are heavily obscured. Characters can sneak up on these raiders and gain a surprise round against them, as long as they avoid Group B in the process.": "C组由四个{@creature Cultist||cultists}和四个{@creature Kobold||kobolds}组成，紧紧地簇拥着寺庙的后门。他们微薄的火力几乎没有产生什么火焰，反而产生了巨大的浓烟云，吞没了寺庙的后面，并覆盖了周围30英尺的地面。烟雾中的一切都被轻度遮蔽，而透过15英尺以上的烟雾看到的物体或生物则被严重遮蔽。只要在这个过程中避开B组，角色就可以偷袭这些突袭者，并获得一个对他们的突袭回合。",
	"The heroes' best shot at rescuing the townsfolk is to overpower Group C and take control of the back door. In the temple, they can arrange a distraction to keep Groups A and B occupied at the front while the citizens of Greenest slip out the back and race for the keep or for the old tunnel—if characters have opened it already. That's only one possibility; clever players can come up with different solutions.": "英雄们营救镇民的最好办法是制服C组并控制后门。在神庙里，他们可以安排分散注意力，让A组和B组占据前门，而Greenest的市民则从后门溜走，争先恐后地去找堡垒或旧隧道--如果角色已经打开了它。这只是一种可能性；聪明的玩家可以想出不同的解决方案。",
	"The townsfolk in the temple are near panic, however, and they won't take orders from strangers unless someone makes a successful DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. Otherwise, characters need to locate the priest of Chauntea, Eadyan Falconmoon, a level-headed half-elf. He's easy to spot, being the only calm person they can find in the temple, and he is elated to see them. He looks to the characters for a plan.": "然而，神庙里的镇民近乎恐慌，他们不会接受陌生人的命令，除非有人成功地进行DC15魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查。否则，人物需要找到Chauntea的牧师，Eadyan Falconmoon，一个平头的半精灵。他很容易被发现，是他们在神庙中唯一能找到的平静的人，他看到他们时很高兴。他向这些人物询问了一个计划。",
	"Time is pressing. While characters are inside the temple, remind them of the booming blows of the battering ram against the front doors and the frightened townsfolk. How much time you allow before the doors burst open depends on your group. What's important is that players feel pressed. To create a sense of pressure, give the front doors 30 hit points and let each thud of the battering ram deal {@dice 1d6} bludgeoning damage. When the doors reach 20 hit points, they have cracks large enough to see through. At 10 hit points, the doors sag in their hinges. At 5, they could collapse at the next impact. How frequently you roll the die is up to you! One roll every 15–20 seconds is a good target for an average group. Be flexible, judge the players' level of tension, and don't let anyone relax.": "时间紧迫。当人物在神庙里时，提醒他们注意撞锤对前门的轰鸣声和受惊吓的镇民。在门突然打开之前，你允许多少时间取决于你的团队。重要的是，玩家要感到有压力。为了创造一种压力感，给前门30点命中率，让撞锤的每一次撞击都造成{@dice 1d6}重击伤害。当门的命中率达到20时，它们的裂缝大到可以看穿。在10点的时候，门的铰链会下垂。在5点时，它们可能在下一次撞击中倒塌。掷骰子的频率由你决定。每15-20秒掷一次骰子对于一个普通小组来说是个好的目标。要有灵活性，判断玩家的紧张程度，不要让任何人放松。",
	"If the doors burst open before the temple is evacuated, this scene turns into an ugly melee against Group A. The kobolds in that group prefer to attack unarmed villagers instead of lethal adventurers. Each kobold automatically kills one villager each round unless characters attack the kobolds, cut them off from their victims, or interfere some other way. If townsfolk have already evacuated the temple through the back door, or that process is well along before the front doors split apart under the ram, then characters can conduct a fighting withdrawal through the temple. After everyone gets into the smoke outside, they can close and brace the back door, then sprint for the keep or the tunnel in the stream bank with enough of a head start to get away safely.": "如果在寺庙被疏散之前大门突然打开，这个场景就会变成一场针对A组的丑陋混战。每个哥布林每回合自动杀死一个村民，除非角色攻击哥布林，切断他们与受害者的联系，或以其他方式进行干扰。如果村民们已经从后门撤离了寺庙，或者在前门被撞开之前，这个过程就已经开始了，那么角色们就可以通过寺庙进行战斗性撤退。在每个人都进入外面的烟雾中后，他们可以关闭并加固后门，然后冲刺到堡垒或河岸上的隧道，并有足够的先机来安全离开。",

The creature stops about eighty yards from the main gate of the keep and scans the walls. A line of kobolds fans out behind it. With their spears, they prod four human prisoners into the dim light.

He agrees to these terms for the combat: The three children will be set loose immediately, but his kobolds will continue to stand guard over the woman, and they will kill her if anyone interferes in the fight—for example, if archers in the keep let fly at him. Regardless of who wins, the woman will be released when the fight is over; and the victor will be the last one standing.": "西恩沃斯很高兴看到一个冠军站出来。他同意了这些战斗条款：三个孩子将被立即释放，但他的哥布林将继续守卫这个女人，如果有人干扰战斗，他们将杀死她--例如，如果守卫中的弓箭手向他放箭。无论谁赢了，战斗结束后，这个女人将被释放；胜利者将是最后站立的人。",
	"Governor Nighthill holds his troops in the keep during the combat. Adventurers can go out if they want, but the half-dragon insists that they keep their distance and stay between him and the fortress. If characters try to surround him or to edge into position for an ambush, he warns them that his kobolds won't hesitate to kill the hostages if they see signs of treachery. The half-dragon is evil, but he has a deep sense of honor about one-on-one combat. He doesn't intend any shenanigans, and he won't allow any from his kobolds.": "在战斗期间，奈特希尔总督把他的部队留在堡垒里。如果冒险者愿意，他们可以出去，但半龙人坚持要求他们保持距离，留在他和堡垒之间。如果角色们试图包围他或进入伏击位置，他警告他们，如果他的哥布林看到背叛的迹象，他们会毫不犹豫地杀死人质的。半龙人是邪恶的，但他对一对一的战斗有一种深深的荣誉感。他不打算做任何恶作剧，他也不允许他的哥布林做任何恶作剧。",
	"Cyanwrath is the likely winner of this match, whether he's fighting Sergeant Markguth or a character. When his foe drops, he strikes one more time; the last blow kills Markguth or inflicts one death roll failure on a character. If Cyanwrath loses the fight, the kobolds immediately jump in to protect his body and carry it away. (Cyanwrath will recover from his wounds and be encountered again later.) If by some mischance Cyanwrath is killed or captured, his place in the dragon hatchery ({@adventure chapter 3|HotDQ|3}) is taken by another half-dragon.": "Cyanwrath可能是这场比赛的赢家，无论他是与Markguth中士还是一个角色作战。当他的敌人倒下时，他再打一次；最后一击杀死马克古斯或对一个角色造成一次死亡卷轴失败。如果Cyanwrath在战斗中失败了，哥布林们会立即跳进去保护他的尸体并把它运走。(Cyanwrath会从他的伤口中恢复过来，并在以后再次遇到。)如果因为某种不幸，Cyanwrath被杀或被抓，他在龙族孵化场的位置({@adventure chapter 3|HotDQ|3})会被另一个半龙族取代。",
	"With the fight over, the last of the raiders retreat en masse from the town into the darkness, marching away toward the southeast.": "随着战斗的结束，最后一批突击队员从镇上集体撤退到黑暗中，向东南方向行进。",
	"If a character steps up to the challenge and fights Cyanwrath, each party member earns 50 XP. If not, characters receive nothing for this encounter. A team of healers with healer's kits and +4 bonuses to Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) checks attend to the wounded or dying character, and Governor Nighthill gratefully offers two {@item Potion of Healing||potions of healing} to the wounded character. If characters do something that costs the life of a hostage, Governor Nighthill is furious with them and offers no more help.": "如果一个角色挺身而出迎接挑战并与Cyanwrath战斗，每个党员都会获得50XP。如果没有，角色在这次遭遇战中没有任何收获。一组带着治疗包和+4智慧加成（{@skill Medicine}）检查的治疗师照顾受伤或濒死的角色，Nighthill总督感激地给受伤的角色提供两个{@item Potion of Healing||potions of healing}。如果人物做了牺牲人质生命的事情，夜神督对他们很生气，并且不再提供帮助。",
	"It's assumed that when characters first see the fighting in Greenest, they will rush to its defense. If they don't, and they're traveling with others, then the NPCs they're traveling with suggest that an immediate attack might turn the tide or at least save many lives. If characters still sit out this fight, they see about half of the attackers leave around midnight, with the rest retiring in small groups over the next few hours. When the sun comes up, even a quick inspection shows that over half of the buildings are heavily damaged and much of the town's wealth was carried away. Hundreds of injured people are crowded into the keep or are found hiding in cellars, but most of them will survive.": "我们假定，当人物第一次看到Greenest的战斗时，他们会赶去保卫它。如果他们不这样做，而他们又和其他人一起旅行，那么和他们一起旅行的NPC就会建议立即进攻，这可能会扭转局势，或者至少能挽救许多人的生命。如果人物仍旧坐视这场战斗，他们会看到大约一半的攻击者在午夜时分离开，剩下的人在接下来的几个小时里分批撤退。当太阳升起时，即使是快速检查也会发现，超过一半的建筑物被严重损坏，镇上的许多财富被带走了。数以百计的伤员被挤进守卫所，或被发现躲在地窖里，但他们中的大多数人都能活下来。",
	"In the warm light of day, Governor Nighthill and other leaders want to know who was behind the attack on Greenest, and why the town was a target. The raiders retreated toward the southeast, and their trail is easy to spot. A small, stealthy group could follow the trail to the raiders' camp and gather information.": "在温暖的阳光下，奈特希尔总督和其他领导人想知道谁是袭击格林斯特的幕后黑手，以及为什么该镇会成为目标。袭击者向东南方向撤退，他们的踪迹很容易发现。一个小型的、隐蔽的小组可以沿着这条线索找到袭击者的营地并收集信息。",
	"Governor Nighthill approaches the characters with a proposal: If they locate the raiders' camp and find out certain information, he offers to pay them 250 gp apiece. He wants to know where the camp is sited, how many raiders are there, who their leaders are, what's motivating these attacks, and where they plan to strike next. If characters recover valuables that were stolen from the town, he would like them returned, but he does his best to arrange a reward from what's left of the town treasury. Recovering treasure, however, is a lesser goal when compared to the other objectives he brings up.": "奈特希尔总督向这些人物提出了一个建议。如果他们找到突袭者的营地并找出某些信息，他愿意支付他们每人250金币。他想知道营地的位置，那里有多少掠夺者，他们的首领是谁，是什么促使了这些袭击，以及他们计划在哪里进行下一次袭击。如果人物找回了从镇上偷来的贵重物品，他希望这些物品能被归还，但他会尽力从镇上国库剩下的钱中安排奖励。然而，与他提出的其他目标相比，追回财宝是一个较小的目标。",
	"Any gear or supplies the characters need for the trip are furnished by the town. As characters prepare to set off on this mission (or to leave town if they turn down the mission), though, an injured monk approaches.": "角色在旅行中所需要的任何装备或用品都由镇上提供。当人物准备出发执行这个任务时（如果他们拒绝了这个任务，就离开小镇），一个受伤的和尚走了过来。",
	"A young man walks up to you, limping heavily on his bandaged left leg. \"I hear that you intend to follow the raiders and see where they've gone. I'd like nothing better than to come with you, but in this condition, I'd slow you down. In the midst of all this tragedy, there's no reason you would have heard about the fate of my master, {@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ}, but it's important you know. He is a monk from Berdusk. He disappeared last night, after we fought a particularly savage battle against raiders. A few others and I fought our way to the keep, barely. Leosin didn't make it at all. We went back this morning to look for him, but all we found was his broken staff and this choker, which he always wore.\"": "一个年轻人走到你面前，用他缠着绷带的左腿沉重地跛着。\"我听说你打算跟踪袭击者，看看他们去了哪里。我最想和你一起去，但在这种情况下，我会让你慢下来。在这一切悲剧中，你没有理由会听说我师父的命运，{@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ}，但你知道这很重要。他是一个来自伯达斯克的修士。他昨天晚上失踪了，在我们与突袭者进行了一场特别野蛮的战斗之后。我和其他几个人勉强打到了堡垒。利奥辛根本没能成功。我们今天早上回去找他，但我们只找到了他的断杖和这个吊坠，他总是戴着它。\"",
	"The monk's name is Nesim Waladra. After introductions are made, he continues.": "这位僧人的名字叫内西姆-瓦拉德拉。在做完介绍后，他继续说道。",
	"\"Leosin has been investigating these raiders for months. I fear that he might have tried to infiltrate their group when they retreated, or worse, was captured and carried away as a prisoner. No one understands these bandits better than he does, and his knowledge will be invaluable against them. When you find their camp, please look for any sign that Leosin is there. One of my brothers has already departed for Berdusk to bring back help, but it will be many days before help arrives. Anything you can do before then would be a godsend.\"": "\"Leosin几个月来一直在调查这些突击队员。我担心他可能在他们撤退时试图渗透到他们的队伍中去，或者更糟糕的是，被俘虏并作为囚犯带走。没有人比他更了解这些强盗，他的知识对他们来说是无价的。当你找到他们的营地时，请寻找任何迹象表明利奥辛在那里。我的一个兄弟已经启程前往伯达斯克，准备带回帮助，但在帮助到达之前，还需要很多天。在那之前，你能做的任何事都是天大的好事。\"",
	"Nesim answers the characters' questions to the best of his ability, but he also urges them to move quickly. The monks were returning to Berdusk from the great library at Candlekeep, where Leosin was consulting the librarians and researching ancient writings on dragon folklore. Dragon cults are his special interest.": "内西姆尽其所能地回答人物的问题，但他也敦促他们迅速行动。僧侣们正从烛台镇的大图书馆返回伯达斯克，利奥辛在那里向图书管理员咨询，研究有关龙族民俗的古代著作。龙的崇拜是他的特殊兴趣。",
	"The broken staff is nothing special. The choker is a braided leather neckband with a silver dragon design chased into the leather. The ends are ragged, as if it was roughly torn off.": "这根断杖没有什么特别之处。颈圈是一条编织的皮革颈带，皮革上凿有银龙图案。两端破破烂烂，好像是被粗暴地撕下来的。",
	"The trail leads south about twelve miles, to a more rugged region where steep-sided, rocky plateaus replace the gently rolling hills. The land between the plateaus is largely flat, broken only by outcroppings and wandering streams in steep-sided gullies. The plateaus jut fifty to one hundred feet above their surroundings and are difficult to climb except where rock falls and subsidence created natural ramps. The crumbling sides of the plateaus are dotted with caves and tumbled boulder fields.": "这条小路向南走了大约12英里，来到一个更加崎岖的地区，这里陡峭的岩石高原取代了平缓的丘陵。高原之间的土地大体上是平坦的，只被陡峭的沟壑中的突起物和游荡的溪流所打破。高原比周围的环境高出50至100英尺，除了岩石坠落和沉降造成的天然坡道外，很难攀登。高原摇摇欲坠的两侧点缀着洞穴和翻滚的巨石场。",
	"Characters can have two encounters during this trip. The first is with a group of raiders who have straggled behind the main body. They are disorganized and quarrelsome, and they should be easy prey for alert adventurers. The second group is an organized rearguard watching specifically for pursuers from the town. They present a much graver threat.": "角色在这次旅行中可以有两次遭遇。第一次是与一群散落在大部队后面的突击队员相遇。他们没有组织，爱吵架，对于警觉的冒险者来说，他们应该是很容易的猎物。第二组是有组织的后卫，专门监视来自镇上的追兵。他们带来的威胁要严重得多。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon has an active recruiting process, accepting initiates from a young age. An initiate (use the {@creature cultist} stat block) trains for months or years before gaining any rank within the organization, and many trainees don't survive the tests. An initiate who passes the tests must choose an affinity to a particular color of dragon: black, blue, green, red, or white. He or she is then welcomed into the ranks as a dragonclaw.": "神龙教有一个积极的招募过程，从年轻时就接受入教者。入教者（使用{@creature cultist}状态块）在获得组织内的任何等级之前要进行数月或数年的训练，许多受训者无法通过测试。通过测试的入会者必须选择对某种特定颜色的龙有亲和力：黑色、蓝色、绿色、红色或白色。然后他或她就会被欢迎加入龙爪的行列。",
	"Most of the cult's operations are overseen by local leaders called Wearers of Purple for the ceremonial robes that they wear. All of the wyrmspeakers are Wearers of Purple, as are lower-ranking cultists appointed by the wyrmspeakers to preside over cult enclaves.": "邪教的大部分活动都是由当地的领导人监督的，他们因为穿着仪式性的长袍而被称为 \"紫袍人\"。所有的巫师长都是紫袍人，由巫师长任命的较低级别的邪教徒也是紫袍人，负责主持邪教飞地。",
	"Characters spot this group's cooking fire smoke from several miles away, because the stragglers stopped to roast a few prairie hens for a meal. They sought shelter in a low spot between surrounding hills, where tall boulders have rolled into a loose jumble. In fact, the surroundings offer no protection while making it easier for enemies to sneak up on the site.": "角色们在几英里外就发现了这群人的炊烟，因为这些散兵游勇停下来烤了几只草原母鸡吃。他们在周围山丘之间的一个低洼处寻求庇护，那里的高大巨石已经滚成了松散的杂物。事实上，周围的环境没有提供任何保护，同时使敌人更容易偷袭这里。",
	"If the group is left alone, the kobolds grab their share of the half-cooked lunch and move about fifty yards away to eat, while the humans continue squabbling over how to cook a hen and the uselessness of kobolds as allies.": "如果这群人被单独留下，哥布林就会抓起他们那份半熟的午餐，移到大约50码以外的地方去吃，而人类则继续为如何烹制母鸡和哥布林作为盟友的无用性而争吵不休。",
	"If characters choose to bypass this group, a detour can get them around it with no difficulty. They could run into these stragglers again on their way back to Greenest.": "如果人物选择绕过这群人，绕道可以让他们毫不费力地绕过它。他们可以在返回格林斯特的路上再次遇到这些散兵游勇。",
	"If characters attack, then unless they give away their presence on purpose (by hailing the camp, for example), they gain a surprise round. The humans spend their first turns retrieving their weapons and shields. The kobolds drop their food and scatter, then regroup and counterattack on round four, using their slings as much as possible. They stick around and fight only as long as any of their human allies are still fighting. As soon as the humans are all defeated, the remaining kobolds slink away into the hills and aren't seen again.": "如果角色发动攻击，那么除非他们故意暴露自己的存在（例如呼唤营地），否则他们将获得一个突击回合。人类在第一轮中收回他们的武器和盾牌。哥布林扔掉食物，一哄而散，然后在第四回合重新集结并反击，尽可能地使用他们的弹弓。只要他们的人类盟友还在战斗，他们就会坚持战斗。一旦人类被打败，剩下的哥布林就会溜进山里，再也看不到了。",
	"Captured kobolds talk freely, but most of what they say is lies. That's not because they try to mislead enemies, but because they will say anything, no matter how outlandish, if it might gain them their freedom.": "被俘虏的哥布林侃侃而谈，但他们所说的大部分都是谎言。这并不是因为他们试图误导敌人，而是因为他们什么都会说，不管多么离谱，只要可能获得自由。",
	"The cultists have 28 sp among them, besides their cheap weapons. The kobolds, who looted despite their orders, have a sack containing pewter candlesticks, some silver serving dishes, and a few religious carvings of Chauntea taken from a home shrine.": "崇拜者们除了廉价的武器外，还有28个sp。哥布林们不顾他们的命令进行抢劫，他们有一个麻袋，里面装着锡制烛台，一些银制餐具，还有一些从家庭神龛上取下的Chauntea的宗教雕刻。",
	"If the characters learn of the camp location and probable site of the rearguard from the stragglers, they can use that information to bypass this encounter entirely. In fact, that would be the smart thing to do, both because it negates a damaging fight and because if the rearguard is wiped out, leaders in the cult will wonder why it never reported back. The best result for the characters is if the outpost checks in at the correct time with an \"all clear.\"": "如果角色们从散兵游勇那里得知了营地的位置和后卫的可能位置，他们就可以利用这些信息完全绕过这场遭遇战。事实上，这将是明智之举，因为这样可以避免一场破坏性的战斗，而且如果后卫被消灭了，邪教的领导人会想知道为什么他们从来没有回来报告。对人物来说，最好的结果是，前哨在正确的时间报到，\"一切正常\"。",
	"If players state that they're watching for potential ambush spots, give them advantage when making these checks.": "如果玩家表示他们正在观察潜在的伏击点，那么在进行这些检查时，要给他们以优势。",
	"Award standard XP for defeated foes. The cultists have no treasure, but their Cult of the Dragon outfits and weapons could be invaluable when characters try to get into the raiders' camp.": "为被击败的敌人奖励标准XP。邪教徒没有财宝，但是当人物试图进入突袭者的营地时，他们的神龙教服装和武器可能是无价之宝。",
	"The cultists have set up their camp in the hollow of a rocky plateau that's shaped roughly like a horseshoe. The lower portion of the plateau rises gently from the surrounding land, but it quickly steepens and ascends to a height of 150 feet above the landscape. Boulders form jumbled heaps at the bases of the cliffs. The level shelves and top of the plateau are covered in long grass, and brush and scrubby trees grow in patches.": "邪教分子在一个岩石高原的凹陷处安营扎寨，这个高原的形状大致像一个马蹄形。高原的下部从周围的土地上缓缓升起，但它很快就变得陡峭，并上升到离地表150英尺的高度。巨石在悬崖的底部形成杂乱的堆积物。平坦的架子和高原的顶部覆盖着长草，灌木丛和灌木丛的树木成片生长。",
	"The steep sides of the plateau are dotted with shallow caves. Boulders or brush conveniently conceals many of the cave mouths. Characters who need to take a long rest can easily find a secure cave in which to hide.": "高原陡峭的两侧点缀着浅浅的洞穴。巨石或灌木丛方便地掩盖了许多洞口。需要长时间休息的人物可以很容易地找到一个安全的山洞来躲藏。",
	"The cultists have built two guard towers at the camp, one at the entrance to the hollow and one atop the plateau. These towers are 20 feet high and made from rough timbers lashed together with rope. They are large enough for a few lookouts. The tower at the mouth of the hollow is manned by kobolds, while warriors man the one above. The guards have horns to blow when they must sound an alarm.": "邪教分子在营地建造了两座守卫塔，一座在空地的入口处，一座在高原之上。这些塔楼有20英尺高，由粗糙的木头用绳子捆绑而成。它们足够大，可供几名瞭望员使用。洞口的塔由哥布林看守，而上面的塔则由战士看守。守卫有喇叭，当他们必须发出警报时可以吹响。",
	"The sides of the plateau rise sharply, while the floor of the hollow slopes up gradually toward the east. A long ladder is lashed to the cliff so guards can reach the upper guard tower.": "高地的两侧急剧上升，而空洞的地面则逐渐向东倾斜。一条长梯被绑在悬崖上，以便守卫可以到达上面的警卫塔。",
	"The raiders live in circular huts made from closely spaced wooden or bone poles covered in hide, mud, and sod. Huts vary in diameter from 10 feet to 25 feet, and in height from 5 feet to 10 feet. (Symbols on the map represent clusters of tents.) Those in the mouth of the hollow (level 1 on the map) are crudely built and decorated with animal skulls. These are occupied by kobolds. Cultists occupy the huts on level 2, which are sturdier, cleaner, and decorated with painted designs representing dragons. A few tents on level 2 are set aside for prisoners.": "袭击者住在圆形的小屋中，这些小屋由密密麻麻的木杆或骨杆制成，上面覆盖着兽皮、泥土和草皮。小屋的直径从10英尺到25英尺不等，高度从5英尺到10英尺。(地图上的符号代表帐篷群。）那些位于空洞口的帐篷（地图上的第一层）建造得很简陋，用动物头骨装饰。这些帐篷是由哥布林占据的。崇拜者占据了第二层的小屋，这些小屋更坚固，更干净，并装饰有代表龙的绘画图案。第二层的几个帐篷是为囚犯准备的。",
	"For the first day following the raid, the cultists are both elated with the outcome and exhausted. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} doesn't expect a serious challenge from the town, and slower members of the raiding party and walking wounded straggle into camp all through the day after the raid. The situation at the camp is confused and security is lax. Most of these raiders are mercenaries and bandits, and not even the dedicated cultists wear recognizable uniforms on raids. No one challenges latecomers for passwords or security signals. Put simply, the raiders are confident that no enemies followed them this far. Characters can walk straight into the camp without having their identities seriously challenged. In fact, the bolder they are, the more likely they are to blend right in.": "在突袭后的第一天，邪教徒们既对结果感到欣喜，又感到疲惫。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}没有想到镇上会有严重的挑战，突击队中速度较慢的成员和行走的伤员在突击后的一天里都在大摇大摆地进入营地。营地的情况很混乱，安全也很松懈。这些突袭者大多是雇佣兵和强盗，甚至连专职的邪教人员在突袭时也不穿可识别的制服。没有人向迟到的人挑战密码或安全信号。简单地说，突击队员们确信没有敌人跟到这么远。角色可以直接走进营地，而不会受到身份的严重质疑。事实上，他们越是大胆，就越有可能直接混进去。",
	"Players may be tempted to have characters seek cover and observe during the day and not attempt to enter the camp until nightfall. This can work, too, but sneaking around in the dark is more likely to attract suspicion than simply walking in as if they belong in the camp.": "玩家可能会想让角色在白天寻找掩护和观察，直到夜幕降临才试图进入营地。这也是可行的，但在黑暗中偷偷摸摸地走，比简单地走进去，好像他们属于这个营地，更容易引起怀疑。",
	"The chief risk is that someone might recognize the characters from the fighting at Greenest. Have each character make a DC 5 Charisma check. Success means no one remembers the character's face, but failure means that at some time (not necessarily immediately, but when recognition would be the most dramatic), someone in the camp recognizes the character. If characters are wearing Cult of the Dragon regalia taken from the rearguard, the characters have disadvantage on this roll because no one returning to camp at this time should be in uniform. The character who faced Cyanwrath one-on-one, however, has a -4 penalty to the roll. If that character ever comes face-to-face with the half-dragon, recognition is automatic.": "主要的风险是，有人可能会从Greenest的战斗中认出这些人物。让每个角色做一个DC 5的魅力检查。成功意味着没有人记得这个角色的脸，但失败意味着在某个时候（不一定是立即，但在认出的时候是最有戏剧性的），营地里有人认出了这个角色。如果角色穿着从后卫那里取来的神龙教的服装，那么角色在这个卷轴上有劣势，因为此时返回营地的人不应该穿着制服。然而，一对一面对Cyanwrath的角色，在这个卷子上有一个-4的惩罚。如果该角色与半龙人面对面，就会自动被认出。",
	"If characters try to estimate numbers in the camp, they count roughly one hundred kobolds and a mix of bandits, guards, and cultists totaling about eighty—effectively an unlimited supply if characters get the idea of fighting them all.": "如果人物试图估计营地里的人数，他们会发现大约有一百个哥布林和混合的强盗、卫兵和邪教徒，总数约为八十人，如果人物有与他们全部战斗的想法，那么实际上是无限的供应。",
	"If anyone was recognized from the fighting in Greenest, it doesn't matter what the characters say. Mondath sentences all of them to be executed on the morrow, after spending the night tied to posts alongside the monk Leosin. Characters have one night to escape this fate. They might wriggle out of their bonds, bribe or charm a cultist to set them free, or come up with a clever use for a cantrip. If all else fails, Leosin reveals that he has a hidden knife with which they can cut themselves free.": "如果有人在格林斯特的战斗中被认出，那么人物说什么都不重要。蒙达斯判处他们所有人在明天被处死，在与僧侣Leosin一起被绑在柱子上过夜。角色们有一个晚上的时间来逃避这个命运。他们可能会挣脱束缚，贿赂或施展魅力让邪教分子放他们自由，或者想出一个巧妙的法术用途。如果其他方法都失败了，Leosin会透露他有一把隐藏的刀，他们可以用它来解救自己。",
	"If characters admit they came from Greenest and are enemies of the cult, the effect is the same as if they'd been recognized.": "如果人物承认他们来自格林尼斯特，是邪教的敌人，其效果与他们被认出来一样。",
	"If characters lie to Mondath—claiming they are new recruits and this is all a mistake, for example, or that they are studying the cult before deciding whether to join—then compare their Charisma ({@skill Deception}) checks to Mondath's Wisdom check to determine whether she believes them. You can allow advantage or disadvantage on the roll when someone's lies are especially plausible or implausible. Match die rolls individually for every character. Those who Mondath believes are set free, but watched and stopped if they try to leave the camp. Those who Mondath does not believe are sentenced to die as above.": "如果角色对Mondath撒谎--比如说，声称他们是新成员，这都是个错误，或者说他们在决定是否加入之前正在研究邪教--那么将他们的魅力（{@skill Deception}）检查与Mondath的智慧检查进行比较，以确定她是否相信他们。当某人的谎言特别可信或不可信时，你可以在掷骰子时允许优势或劣势。为每个角色单独匹配掷骰子的次数。那些蒙达斯相信的人被释放，但如果他们试图离开营地，会被监视和阻止。那些蒙达斯不相信的人将被判处死刑，如上所述。",
	"Characters can learn much from poking around in the camp. If the characters pose as cult members, they can speak to other cultists and question them (carefully) about the cult's plans and long-term goals. Most cultists should be treated as indifferent when determining reactions or trying to gain a favor. Kobolds are less helpful and should be considered hostile when characters make Charisma checks to gauge their reaction.": "角色可以从营地里的打探中了解到很多东西。如果角色冒充邪教成员，他们可以与其他邪教成员交谈，并询问他们（仔细）关于邪教的计划和长期目标。在确定反应或试图获得好感时，大多数邪教人员应被视为无动于衷。哥布林的帮助较少，当角色进行魅力检查以判断他们的反应时，应被视为有敌意。",
	"Characters can learn the following information through observation and questioning. They need to be careful, however, not to attract attention for asking too many questions or poking their noses into things that are none of their business. Any time they come off as \"too nosy,\" feel free to call for another Charisma check to see whether someone recognizes them from Greenest.": "角色可以通过观察和询问了解以下信息。然而，他们需要小心，不要因为问太多问题或对与自己无关的事情刨根问底而引起注意。如果他们表现得 \"太爱管闲事\"，可以随时要求再做一次魅力检查，看看是否有人认出了他们来自格林斯特。",

	"Not everyone here is a full-fledged member of the cult. Many are new initiates working toward full acceptance, and many others are simple mercenaries, hired to flesh out the camp's strength during raids or if it should come under attack.": "这里不是每个人都是邪教的正式成员。许多人是正在努力争取被完全接受的新成员，还有许多人是简单的雇佣兵，在突袭或受到攻击时被雇来充实营地的力量。",
	"The kobolds are here because their worshipful attitude toward dragons makes them easy for {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} and other high-ranking cultists to manipulate, but they are not well liked or trusted by the other races.": "哥布林在这里是因为他们对龙的崇拜态度使他们很容易被{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}和其他高级邪教徒所操纵，但他们并不被其他种族所喜欢或信任。",
	"Hunters who bring in antelope and other large game from the grasslands feed the camp. The cultists and their allies eat most of it, but some is stored in the cave to feed the hatchlings.": "从草原上带来羚羊和其他大型猎物的猎人为营地提供食物。邪教徒和他们的盟友吃其中的大部分，但也有一些储存在山洞里，用来喂养孵化的孩子。",
	"The cult has been ranging far and wide on small raids to collect treasure. Greenest was the closest target to the camp, the biggest of all the towns they've attacked, and the most profitable—praise Tiamat's glory!": "邪教组织一直在远距离进行小规模的突袭，以收集宝藏。最绿的地方是离营地最近的目标，也是他们攻击过的所有城镇中最大的一个，也是最有利可图的--赞美提亚马特的荣耀！\"。",
	"Prisoners are used for manual labor. In the past, a few have \"converted\" and become loyal members of the cult, but most die eventually of overwork and undernourishment. Then they are fed to the drakes or taken into the cave to feed the hatchlings.": "囚犯们被用来从事体力劳动。在过去，少数人 \"改邪归正\"，成为邪教的忠实成员，但大多数人最终死于过度劳累和营养不良。然后，他们被喂给德拉克人，或被带进山洞喂养孵化的孩子。",
	"The half-blue dragon Cyanwrath is Mondath's right hand and is seldom far from her side. He has a rigid sense of honor, but you don't want to make him angry.": "半蓝龙Cyanwrath是Mondath的右手，很少远离她的身边。他有严格的荣誉感，但你不希望让他生气。",

	"Aside from being recognized, the chief risk of spending time in the cultist camp is getting roped into a work detail. Characters might be selected by an officer to spend a few hours helping with food preparation, standing guard in a tower, practicing weapon drill, or even cleaning up after animals (a job usually reserved for prisoners, but currently the number of prisoners in the camp is low).": "除了被认出来之外，在邪教营地呆上一段时间的主要风险是被拉去做工作。角色可能会被军官选中，花几个小时帮助准备食物，在塔楼上站岗，练习武器演习，甚至清理动物（这通常是留给囚犯的工作，但目前营地里的囚犯数量很少）。",
	"The monk is tied to a stake at the back of the camp (area 3). He has been severely beaten, and he has been denied food and water in an effort to break his spirit. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} knows from informants across the Sword Coast that Leosin has been researching the cult's history and recent activity. The wyrmspeaker wants to know how much Leosin has learned and with whom he shared his information. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} considered it an amazing stroke of luck that Leosin was captured during the raid.": "这名僧人被绑在营地后面的一个木桩上（3号区域）。他遭到了严重的殴打，他被剥夺了食物和水，试图打垮他的精神。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}从整个剑海岸的线人那里得知，利奥辛一直在研究这个邪教的历史和最近的活动。巫师想知道Leosin了解了多少，以及他与谁分享了他的信息。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}认为Leosin在突袭中被抓获是一个惊人的运气之举。",
	"That portion of Leosin's scheme has worked reasonably well. He now knows most of the information listed above under \"Exploring the Camp.\" Unfortunately for him, captivity has been more brutal than he expected, and although his mind and will are still strong, he's in a very poor physical state.": "利奥辛的这部分计划取得了合理的效果。他现在知道上面 \"探索营地 \"项下所列的大部分信息。对他来说，不幸的是，囚禁比他预期的更残酷，虽然他的头脑和意志仍然很坚强，但他的身体状况非常糟糕。",
	"Despite the danger, Leosin isn't entirely happy about being rescued if characters come to set him free. He believes he can learn more, and he's willing to take the risk. He's too weak to resist, however, so characters can easily take him away against his will if that's what they want to do. He can move without aid at a speed of 20 feet and fights as a commoner with disadvantage on attack rolls. If characters don't bring him out of the camp, Leosin breaks away on his own. He refuses to talk about it later.": "尽管有危险，但如果有人物来解救他，Leosin并不完全高兴。他相信自己可以学到更多东西，他愿意冒这个险。然而，他太软弱了，无法抵抗，所以如果他们想这么做的话，人物可以轻易地违背他的意愿把他带走。他可以在没有援助的情况下以20英尺的速度移动，并以平民身份战斗，在攻击卷上处于劣势。如果人物不把他带出营地，Leosin就会自己挣脱。他后来拒绝谈论此事。",
	"Award standard XP for defeated foes. This chapter does not involve many fights, but it does present many challenges, and characters should be rewarded for overcoming them. The awards listed below are just recommendations; adjust them and add to them as you see fit. Characters can reach 3rd level if they act prudently and capitalize on all the opportunities the camp offers, but it's not essential that they do.": "为被打败的敌人奖励标准XP。这一章的战斗不多，但确实提出了许多挑战，人物克服了这些挑战就应该得到奖励。下面列出的奖励只是建议，你可以根据自己的需要进行调整和补充。如果角色谨慎行事并利用营地提供的所有机会，他们可以达到第三级，但这并不是他们必须这样做。",

	"When the characters arrive safely back at Greenest—presumably with Leosin in tow—he can fill them in on any details they missed during their investigation of the cult's camp. The monks who accompanied him are delighted to see him alive, and the families of any other released prisoners are equally grateful for the return of their loved ones. Governor Nighthill pays the characters their promised 250 gp each and publicly praises their courage and daring.": "当人物安全地回到格林斯特时--估计是在Leosin的陪同下--他可以把他们在调查邪教营地时遗漏的任何细节都告诉他们。陪同他的僧侣们很高兴看到他还活着，其他被释放的囚犯的家人也同样对他们的亲人回来表示感谢。奈特希尔总督向这些人物支付了他们承诺的每人250金币，并公开赞扬他们的勇气和胆量。",
	"After his experience in captivity, Leosin needs several days to recover. When he's healthy again, he intends to travel north to Elturel to convey what he's learned to {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}, a paladin of Torm who shares his concern over the Cult of the Dragon's recent surge in activity. He has a favor to ask of the characters.": "在被囚禁的经历之后，利奥辛需要几天时间来恢复。当他恢复健康后，他打算前往北方的艾尔图勒，将他所学到的东西传达给{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}，这位托尔姆的圣骑士与他一样对龙之教最近的活动激增感到担忧。他有一个要求，就是请这些人物帮忙。",
	"\"After all you've done already for me personally and for the people of Greenest, I hate to ask anything more from you. But the need is great, and I dare to hope that you can aid me one time more. I need you to return to the cultists' camp. You know your way around it now. If the cultists are preparing to conduct another raid, or a large body of them marches away, or if anything substantial is carried into or out of that cave, I need to know. If you have a chance to get into the camp and look around again, that would be the ideal way to spot anything that's changed.": "\"在你已经为我个人和Greenest的人们做了那么多事之后，我不想再向你要求什么。但需求是巨大的，我敢于希望你能再援助我一次。我需要你回到邪教分子的营地。你现在知道怎么走了。如果邪教分子准备进行另一次突袭，或者他们中的一大批人行军离开，或者如果有什么实质性的东西被带进或带出那个洞穴，我都需要知道。如果你有机会进入营地，再看看周围，这将是发现任何变化的理想方式。",
	"\"I don't recommend letting yourselves get captured,\" he adds with a wry smile.": "\"我不建议让你们自己被抓，\"他狡黠地笑着补充道。",
	"The monk doesn't believe it's essential that the characters head back to the camp immediately. He doesn't expect the cultists to make any sudden changes in their plans or mode of operation. Leosin is wrong about this, because he doesn't realize how much his presence in Greenest alarmed the wyrmspeaker. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} knows that Leosin is investigating the Cult of the Dragon, but she doesn't know whether the monk's appearance in Greenest was a coincidence, a good guess, or a sign that the cult's whole plan has been compromised. She isn't willing to take chances: she's heading north with the accumulated treasure immediately.": "和尚认为人物立即返回营地并不是必须的。他并不指望邪教分子会突然改变他们的计划或行动方式。Leosin在这一点上是错误的，因为他没有意识到他在Greenest的出现让wyrmspeaker感到多么震惊。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}知道Leosin正在调查神龙教，但她不知道这个和尚在Greenest的出现是一个巧合，一个好的猜测，还是预示着神龙教的整个计划已经被破坏了。她不愿意冒险：她要立即带着积累的财宝向北走。",
	"When characters return to the camp area, they find it mostly abandoned. (If they stayed, they witnessed the rapid packing up and abandonment of the camp.) The stinking huts of the kobolds (those on level 1) have been burned, but the level 2 huts and both guard towers remain. Anyone can determine from tracks that the cultists trekked away in small groups in all directions. A successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check reveals that most of the camp's wagons and pack animals moved in a train toward the west.": "当人物回到营地区域时，他们发现营地大多被遗弃。(如果他们留下来，他们就目睹了营地的快速收拾和遗弃。） 臭气熏天的哥布林小屋（1层的那些）已经被烧毁，但2层的小屋和两个警卫塔还在。任何人都可以从足迹中判断出，邪教徒们分批向各个方向跋涉离开。成功通过DC10智慧({@skill Perception})检查可以发现，营地的大部分马车和驮运的牲畜都在一列火车中向西移动。",
	"Still left in the camp are some hunters, the kobolds who tend the dragon nursery in the caves, {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}, her guards, and {@creature Langdedrosa Cyanwrath|HotDQ}. Only the hunters still use the huts. All others live in the hatchery cave. The activity and guards around the cave mouth should be the top draw on the characters' attention.": "营地里还剩下一些猎人、在山洞里照看龙苗的哥布林、{@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}、她的卫兵和{@creature Langdedrosa Cyanwrath|HotDQ}。只有猎人还在使用木屋。其他所有人都住在孵化室的洞穴里。洞口周围的活动和守卫应该是最吸引人物注意力的地方。",
	"On most mornings, hunters fan out onto the grassland to hunt for antelope and other large game. They travel on horseback and bring along an extra horse to pack the field-dressed game back to the camp. Hunters don't necessarily return to the camp every evening. They stay out until they have a load of meat to bring back. Hunting on the Greenfields is good, so they seldom need to spend more than a night or two away. Four {@creature Scout||scouts} act as hunters; roll a {@dice d4} to determine how many are in the camp when characters arrive. They are not dedicated cultists, so they won't challenge characters who enter the camp, attack them, or even alert the cultists. They consider standing guard to be beneath them.": "在大多数的早晨，猎人在草原上打猎，寻找羚羊和其他大型动物。他们在马背上行走，并带着一匹额外的马，把穿戴整齐的猎物带回营地。猎人不一定每天晚上都要回到营地。他们一直在外面，直到有一车肉可以带回来。绿原上的狩猎情况很好，所以他们很少需要在外面过一两个晚上。四个{@creature Scout||scouts}充当猎人；当角色到达时，掷一个{@dice d4}来决定有多少人在营地里。他们不是专门的邪教徒，所以他们不会挑战进入营地的人物，不会攻击他们，甚至不会提醒邪教徒。他们认为站岗是在他们之下。",
	"They are a taciturn bunch, so they won't be much help to inquisitive characters. They converse more freely with rangers, but to most strangers they merely nod, point, shake their heads, scowl, and utter one- or two-word answers. If characters converse with them, these hunters can relate how the camp dissolved within hours after the discovery of the captured half-elf's escape. Crates carried from the cave were loaded onto wagons or animals and hauled to the west. A few raiders remain in the cave: the Wearer of Purple (Mondath), the \"dragon-man\" (Cyanwrath), the better warriors, and the \"dragon-dogs\" (kobolds). As long as the cultists pay well for fresh meat, the trackers continue hunting for them. Whatever else the cave holds is none of their concern.": "他们是一群沉默寡言的人，所以他们对好奇的人没有什么帮助。他们与游骑兵交谈时比较随意，但对于大多数陌生人，他们只是点头、指点、摇头、皱眉，并说出一两个字的答案。如果人物与他们交谈，这些猎人可以讲述营地是如何在发现被俘的半精灵逃跑后的几个小时内解散的。从山洞里搬运出来的箱子被装上马车或牲口，拉到了西部。少数突袭者仍留在洞穴中：穿紫衣的人（Mondath）、\"龙人\"（Cyanwrath）、更好的战士和 \"龙狗\"（kobolds）。只要邪教徒们为新鲜的肉付出丰厚的代价，追踪者们就会继续为他们狩猎。不管洞穴里还有什么，都与他们无关。",
	"The only thing of interest remaining in the camp is the cave itself (area 4 on the map of the camp), which characters can see from the camp. There, characters find the cultists who stayed behind, a clutch of dragon eggs, the special cadre of kobolds who tend the eggs—and the many traps the kobolds set to defend their home. These eggs are important to the cult, but they were deemed too near to hatching to be moved safely. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} left them with what she believed was an adequate guard force under {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ} and {@creature Langdedrosa Cyanwrath|HotDQ}.": "营地里唯一有意义的东西是洞穴本身（营地地图上的第4区），角色可以从营地里看到它。在那里，角色们发现了留下来的邪教人员、一窝龙蛋、照顾龙蛋的特殊哥布林干部以及哥布林为保卫家园而设置的许多陷阱。这些龙蛋对邪教很重要，但它们被认为太接近孵化而无法安全移动。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}把它们留给了她认为是足够的护卫力量的{@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}和{@creature Langdedrosa Cyanwrath|HotDQ}手下。",
	"During daytime, areas {@area 1|0af|x} and {@area 2|0b0|x} are brightly lit, and areas{@area  3|0b1|x} and {@area 4|0b4|x} are dimly lit by outside light.

	"The caverns are filled with faint sounds: dripping water, scratching rodents, scrabbling lizards, wind moaning across the entrance. These normal underground sounds camouflage the clanks, thuds, coughs, and speech of the kobolds and cultists. Sound echoes well along the main chamber (areas 1–5), so a fight in any of these can be heard in the others. Elsewhere, normal sounds echo confusingly and are lost in the background noise. The sound of a scream carries a long distance, however, and the sound of a fight travels through 30 feet of tunnel and attracts attention if the fight lasts more than 3 rounds.": "洞穴里充满了微弱的声音：滴水声、啮齿动物的抓挠声、蜥蜴的抓挠声、风在入口处的呻吟声。这些正常的地下声音掩盖了哥布林和邪教徒们的叮当声、砰砰声、咳嗽声和说话声。声音在主室（1-5区）中回响良好，因此在其中任何一个区域的战斗都可以在其他区域听到。在其他地方，正常的声音回声很混乱，并在背景噪音中消失。然而，尖叫的声音可以传得很远，战斗的声音可以穿过30英尺的隧道，如果战斗持续超过3个回合，就会引起注意。",
	"Kobolds move freely through the caverns, going about their business. Characters have a chance to randomly encounter these wandering kobolds. Roll a {@dice d6} every time characters enter or re-enter {@area areas 3|0b1|x} to {@area 10|0c8|x}. On a roll of 1, monsters are present. Roll on the table to determine what they meet. These randomly encountered monsters are added to any creatures mentioned in the area description. Be sure to make this roll before characters enter the area, because both groups have a chance to gain surprise.": "哥布林在洞穴中自由移动，做着自己的事情。角色有机会随机遇到这些游荡的哥布林。每次人物进入或重新进入{@area areas 3|0b1|x}至{@area 10|0c8|x}时，都要掷出{@dice d6}。掷到1时，怪物就会出现。在表格上滚动，以确定他们遇到的是什么。这些随机遇到的怪物会加到区域描述中提到的任何生物上。一定要在人物进入该地区之前进行这个掷骰，因为两组人都有机会获得惊喜。",
	"If characters approach openly through the camp, the dragonclaws spot them automatically and retreat toward area 2 in the cave, to set up an ambush. If characters approach the cave quietly from the sides, they won't be spotted. They then have a chance to surprise the dragonclaws.": "如果角色公开地通过营地接近，龙爪会自动发现他们，并向洞穴中的2号区域撤退，以设下伏击。如果角色从侧面悄悄地接近洞穴，他们就不会被发现。这样他们就有机会给龙爪们一个惊喜。",
	"If the guards at the entrance spotted the characters' approach, they wait here until the characters come into view, then try to spring an ambush. Determine surprise normally.": "如果入口处的卫兵发现了人物的接近，他们就会在这里等待，直到人物进入视野，然后试图发动一场伏击。正常情况下，判断出奇制胜。",
	"The passage at the end of this alcove is deeply shadowed and hidden by a cleverly cut fold in the rock. It's obvious to anyone who walks to the end of the alcove, but from elsewhere in the cavern, it can be spotted only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check.": "这个洞穴尽头的通道有很深的阴影，被岩石上巧妙切割的褶皱所隐藏。对任何走到洞穴尽头的人来说，这都是显而易见的，但从洞穴的其他地方，只有在成功通过DC20智慧({@skill Perception})检查后才能发现它。",
	"The stairs down to area 3 are trapped. See that area's description for details.": "通往3号区域的楼梯被困住了。详见该区域的描述。",
	"The entrance to the cave ends here at a 10-foot drop-off. To your right, broad steps are roughly hewn into a natural stone ramp. The cavern below is carpeted with a profusion of fungi ranging from a few inches high to nearly as tall as a human adult. Two paths lead through the fungi: one on the right and one on the left.": "洞穴的入口在这里结束，有一个10英尺高的落差。在你的右边，宽阔的台阶被粗略地凿成了一个天然的石头坡道。下面的洞穴里铺满了大量的真菌，从几英寸高到几乎和人类成年人一样高。有两条路穿过这些真菌：一条在右边，一条在左边。",
	"The bats calm down and return to their roosts on the ceiling after five minutes of quiet in area 4.": "蝙蝠平静下来，在4号区域安静了5分钟后回到了它们在天花板上的栖息地。",
	"A spear with a pitted blade lies on the floor near the top of the steps leading to area 6. Kobolds use this to bypass the trap at the bottom of the steps (see area 6).": "在通往第6区的台阶顶部附近的地板上，有一把带着凹痕的长矛。哥布林用它来绕过台阶底部的陷阱（见第6区）。",
	"The floor drops down 10 feet at each ledge.": "地板在每个壁架上都下降了10英尺。",
	"Kobolds use this portion of the cave as a trash dump. Along with normal sorts of refuse, such as broken pottery, rotted baskets, and mouse-chewed rope, they've also thrown out items that appear useful from a distance: discarded clothes, worn boots, tattered books, cracked lamps, and so forth. Some of these items came from prisoners who died, and others were taken in treasure raids and later deemed to be unworthy of Tiamat. Characters viewing this area from the ledge see tantalizing glints of metal (belt buckles without belts) and parchment (books rendered illegible by water damage).": "哥布林把山洞的这一部分作为垃圾场。除了正常的各种垃圾，如破碎的陶器、腐烂的篮子和被老鼠咬过的绳子，他们还扔出了一些从远处看来有用的物品：废弃的衣服、破旧的靴子、破烂的书、破裂的灯等等。这些物品有的来自死去的囚犯，有的则是在搜刮财宝时被抢走的，后来被认为不值得提亚马特使用。从壁架上观察这个区域的人物看到了诱人的金属光泽（没有皮带的皮带扣）和羊皮纸（因水渍而变得难以辨认的书籍）。",
	"A thorough search of the trash heap, taking 10 minutes, does find one worthwhile item: an overlooked pouch of six ornamental gems worth 10 gp each and eight semiprecious gems worth 50 gp each. The troglodytes have nothing that anyone would want near them.": "对垃圾堆进行彻底搜查，花了10分钟，确实找到了一件有价值的物品：一个被忽视的小袋子，里面有6颗装饰性宝石，每颗价值10金币，8颗半宝石，每颗价值50金币。蛙人没有任何东西可以让人靠近他们。",
	"The curtain across the entrance to this cavern is trapped. See \"Trapped Curtain\" below for details.": "横跨这个洞穴入口的帘子被困住了。详情见下面的 \"被困的帘子\"。",
	"At the base of these steeply descending steps, a curtain hangs across the passage. It is made from hundreds of heavy leather strips, each about the width of a human hand. The strips are fixed to the ceiling and are long enough to drag on the floor. The curtain extends from wall to wall. The leather comes from a variety of local animals and is badly cured. The curtain is several layers thick with no gaps, so you can't see through it at all.": "在这些陡峭的下行台阶的底部，有一块帘子挂在通道上。它是由数百条沉重的皮条制成的，每条皮条大约有人手的宽度。这些皮条被固定在天花板上，长到可以拖在地板上。帘子从墙上延伸到墙上。皮革来自于当地的各种动物，并且经过了严重的腌制。帘子有好几层厚，没有缝隙，所以你根本看不透它。",
	"This cavern is naturally cold. It hovers a few degrees above freezing year round, regardless of the season. Much of the meat brought in by the hunters feeds the cultists and the kobolds, but the extra is stored here for eventual use when the dragon eggs hatch and the ravenous hatchlings emerge. The carcasses range from very fresh to several months old. The meat is only cold, not frozen, so the older items are slowly going bad.": "这个岩洞是自然寒冷的。无论什么季节，它全年都在冰点以上几度徘徊。猎人们带来的大部分肉都喂养了邪教徒和哥布林，但多余的肉被储存在这里，以便在龙蛋孵化和贪婪的幼龙出现时最终使用。尸体从非常新鲜到几个月大的都有。这些肉只是冷的，而不是冷冻的，所以老的东西会慢慢变坏。",
	"The smell of old blood assaults your nose. The floor is covered with dried puddles of it. Four floor-to-ceiling columns are spaced across the chamber, and chains have been strung between them like clothesline. Animal carcasses hang on hooks from the chains. You see gutted and skinned antelope, deer, goats, what might be big cats, and even a few small bears. Some of this meat has been here for a while if the smell is a reliable indicator.": "旧血的气味袭击了你的鼻子。地板上布满了干涸的水坑。四根从地板到天花板的柱子横跨整个房间，铁链像晾衣绳一样被串在它们之间。动物的尸体挂在铁链的钩子上。你看到被开膛破肚的羚羊、鹿、山羊、可能是大猫的东西，甚至还有几只小熊。如果气味是一个可靠的指标，这些肉有些已经在这里有一段时间了。",
	"This cave contains nothing of value.": "这个山洞里没有任何有价值的东西。",
	"Hidden amid the leather strips of the curtain are hundreds of metal barbs coated with poison. Anyone who brushes through the curtain must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 ({@dice 1d10}) poison damage, and the target's hit point maximum is reduced by 5 This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.": "在帘子的皮条中隐藏着数百个涂有毒药的金属倒刺。任何刷过帘子的人都必须在DC 10的灵巧救赎上成功，否则就会受到5({@dice 1d10})的毒药伤害，而且目标的最大命中率会降低5。这种降低会持续到目标完成长时间休息。",
	"A careful inspection of the leather strips coupled with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check finds barbs; they can't be noticed otherwise. When kobolds use this stairway, they bring the ruined spear that's kept in{@area  area 4|0b4|x}. With it, they sweep the leather strips to the left side of the corridor and wedge the end of the spear shaft into an angled socket in the floor just inside area 6. This holds the leather strips safely out of the way while they move in and out of the chamber.": "仔细检查皮条，再加上成功的DC10智慧({@skill Perception})检查，可以发现倒刺；否则就不会被发现。当哥布林使用这个楼梯的时候，他们会带上放在{@area  area 4|0b4|x}的废旧长矛。他们用它把皮条扫到走廊的左边，然后把矛杆的一端楔入6号区域内地板上的一个斜面插座。在他们进出密室的时候，这样可以将皮条安全地挡住。",
	"The lower area is where cultists conducted the rituals to create their guard drakes and then housed the creatures. The ledge is a sharp 10-foot drop-off. Wooden stairs descend at the right end of the ledge. A stout cage made of iron bars surrounds these steps to a height of 10 feet to prevent untrained drakes from escaping up the steps. A key hangs on a peg at the top of the steps; it opens the locked gate at the bottom.": "下面的区域是邪教徒们举行仪式创造他们的护卫德拉克的地方，然后安置这些生物。壁架是一个10英尺高的落差。木制楼梯在壁架的右端下降。一个由铁条制成的坚固的笼子围绕着这些台阶，高度为10英尺，以防止未经训练的鸭子从台阶上逃掉。一把钥匙挂在台阶顶部的木桩上；它可以打开底部上锁的大门。",
	"A rack along the southwest wall holds implements used in training the drakes: long poles with lassos at the end, used for snaring and controlling young drakes; leashes and collars; sharp prods; mock weapons made of wood; human-sized dummies stitched out of sailcloth and stuffed with straw, with ridiculous expressions painted on their faces.": "西南墙边的一个架子上放着训练公牛的工具：末端有拉索的长杆，用于捕捉和控制小公牛；皮带和项圈；锋利的棍棒；木制的模拟武器；用帆布缝制的、塞满稻草的人类大小的假人，脸上画着可笑的表情。",
	"Thin mattresses of straw covered with badly cured furs form small beds that are haphazardly positioned around the chamber. Rats and small lizards scurry through the food scraps and moldy wine skins littering the floor.": "薄薄的稻草床垫上覆盖着劣质的毛皮，形成小床，胡乱地摆放在房间周围。老鼠和小蜥蜴在散落在地上的食物残渣和发霉的酒皮中乱窜。",
	"The top step is rigged to drop a portion of the ceiling in area 7. As each character enters the staircase, roll any die. On an odd roll, the character steps in the wrong spot and triggers the trap. The ceiling collapses above the next character in line (the one behind the character who triggered the trap). That character takes {@dice 4d4} bludgeoning damage from falling rocks; the damage is halved if the character makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Every character within 5 feet takes {@dice 2d4} bludgeoning damage, or half that with a successful saving throw.": "最上面的台阶被操纵在第7区的天花板上落下一部分。当每个角色进入楼梯时，掷出任何骰子。如果是奇数，这个角色就会踩到错误的地方并触发陷阱。天花板在下一个排队的角色（即触发陷阱的角色后面的角色）上方坍塌。该角色受到落石带来的{@dice 4d4}重击伤害；如果该角色成功地进行了DC15灵巧救赎，则伤害减半。5英尺范围内的每个角色都会受到{@dice 2d4}的重击伤害，如果救赎成功则伤害减半。",

	"If the character beat the odds in Greenest and won the fight, you can paraphrase to reflect that. As soon as he finishes speaking, he attacks. As long as none of the characters intervene, Cyanwrath's group knows better than to interfere in his one-on-one matches. If the characters gang up on Cyanwrath or one of his guards, or try to leave the chamber, the guards attack.": "如果这个人物在格林斯特击败了对手，赢得了战斗，你可以通过解析来反映。他一说完，就开始攻击。只要没有一个角色插手，Cyanwrath的团体就知道最好不要干涉他的一对一比赛。如果角色们联合起来攻击Cyanwrath或他的一个守卫，或者试图离开密室，守卫们就会攻击。",
	"If none of the characters fought Cyanwrath during the raid but spent time in the cultists' camp, read this.": "如果在突袭过程中，没有一个角色与青瓦台作战，但在邪教组织的营地里呆了一段时间，请看这个。",
	"\"You look familiar... I've seen you around the camp. If you came looking for trouble, I am the trouble you seek.\"": "\"你看起来很眼熟... 我在营地周围见过你。如果你是来找麻烦的，我就是你要找的麻烦。\"",
	"Then he attacks, and his guards join in immediately.": "然后他发动攻击，他的卫兵也立即加入进来。",
	"The creatures in {@area area 10|0c8|x} are not drawn to this fight. They hide and wait to see who wins. When the fight is over, characters have time to investigate the room.": "在{@area area 10|0c8|x}的生物没有被吸引到这场战斗。他们躲起来，等着看谁赢。当战斗结束后，角色们有时间调查这个房间。",
	"This chamber has been enlarged and reshaped from its original form. The floor and three of the walls are smooth, and stalactites and stalagmites have been polished into gleaming columns. Every surface glistens with moisture, and the air is warm and humid. The flat walls of the chamber are decorated with shallow abstract carvings of dragons. Dragons' tails coil into intricate patterns and knots that flow across the walls. The creature portrayed in the northwest corner stands out: a five-headed dragon, rising from an erupting volcano. Other dragons, which seem dwarfed by the five-headed monstrosity, flock to its side. A small, wooden chest with silver and mother-of-pearl inlays sits on the floor in the corner, in front of the monstrous dragon carving.": "这个密室在原来的基础上进行了扩建和重塑。地板和三面墙壁都很光滑，钟乳石和石笋都被打磨成闪闪发光的柱子。每一个表面都闪烁着水汽，空气温暖而湿润。密室的平坦墙壁上装饰着浅浅的龙的抽象雕刻。龙的尾巴卷成复杂的图案和结，在墙壁上流动。西北角所描绘的生物非常突出：一条五头龙，从喷发的火山中升起。其他的龙，在五头怪兽面前显得相形见绌，纷纷涌向它的身边。角落里的地板上放着一个镶嵌着银色和珍珠母的小木箱，就在那条巨龙雕刻的前面。",
	"The five-headed dragon is Tiamat, and the volcano is the Well of Dragons, where the Cult of the Dragon intends to bring Tiamat into the world. The Well of Dragons is located at the northern extreme of the Sunset Mountains. Most characters should recognize Tiamat from folktales and know she was banished to the Nine Hells long ago and remains imprisoned there. There is no way to tell from the carvings where the volcano is located, or to know if it's meant to be a prediction of events to come or just a birth metaphor for the queen of evil dragons.": "五头龙是提亚马特（Tiamat），火山是龙之井，龙之教打算在这里将提亚马特带入世界。龙之井位于落日山脉的最北端。大多数角色应该都能从民间故事中认出提亚马特，并知道她很久以前就被放逐到九层地狱，并一直被囚禁在那里。我们无法从雕刻中得知火山的位置，也无法知道它是对未来事件的预言，还是只是对恶龙女王的诞生的隐喻。",
	"The chest is locked and trapped; see \"Acid Trap\" below for details. Characters can open it with the key from {@area area 11|0ce|x}, or the lock can be picked with {@item thieves' tools|PHB} and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. Unless the Dexterity roll is 15 or higher, however, it sets off the trap when the chest opens.": "这个箱子被锁住了，详情见下面的 \"酸性陷阱\"。角色可以用{@area area 11|0ce|x}的钥匙打开它，或者用{@item thieves' tools|PHB}和成功的DC 10灵巧检查来撬开锁。除非灵巧值达到15或更高，否则当箱子打开时就会触发陷阱。",
	"The holes in the dragons' mouths are nozzles for a trap that sprays acidic mist. The trap has two triggers. The first is under the chest in the northwest corner. If the chest is moved, the trap goes off. The second is in the chest. If it is forced open, or if the lock is inexpertly picked (a Dexterity result of 14 or less), the trap goes off.": "龙嘴上的孔是陷阱的喷嘴，可以喷出酸雾。这个陷阱有两个触发器。第一个是在西北角的箱子下面。如果箱子被移动，陷阱就会爆炸。第二个是在箱子里。如果它被强行打开，或者如果锁被不熟练地撬开（灵巧的结果为14或更少），陷阱就会爆炸。",
	"You hear a snap from beneath the chest, followed by a hissing sound like dozens of angry snakes—or like liquid moving through open tubes. A moment later, liquid sprays out from dozens of tiny holes in the walls and ceiling. Wherever it splashes onto the floor, the moisture on the stone bubbles and smokes. Within moments, the chamber is filled with acidic mist.": "你听到胸口下面传来啪的一声，接着是嘶嘶的声音，像几十条愤怒的蛇，或者像液体在开放的管道中移动。一会儿，液体从墙壁和天花板上的几十个小孔中喷出。无论它溅到哪里，石头上的水分都会冒泡和冒烟。不一会儿，房间里就充满了酸雾。",
	"The chamber that opens at the bottom of the stairs is immense. A wide ledge runs along the left wall and drops away to a pit on the right. Many stalactites descend from the ceiling, and the sound of dripping water echoes continuously.": "在楼梯底部打开的密室是巨大的。一个宽阔的壁架沿着左边的墙壁延伸，并下降到右边的一个坑里。许多钟乳石从天花板上落下，滴水声不断回荡。",
	"The lower portion of the room (10A) is 15 feet below the ledge. Wooden steps have been built down to the lower floor. As in room 7, the steps are enclosed in a stout iron cage with a gate at the bottom. The key to the gate hangs on a wall peg opposite the top of the stairs. As soon as characters advance into the room as far as the top of the stairs, they come under attack from the kobolds hiding in 10B. See that description for details.": "房间的下部（10A）比壁架低15英尺。木制的台阶已经建到了下层。和7号房间一样，台阶被围在一个坚固的铁笼子里，底部有一个门。大门的钥匙挂在楼梯顶端对面的墙上的钉子上。只要人物进入房间，走到楼梯顶端，他们就会受到躲在10B的哥布林的攻击。详情见该描述。",
	"From the ledge, characters can just make out the shapes of large eggs (each egg is nearly three feet tall) in the darkness below. The cavern extends into darkness beyond the range of their light. They need to go down the stairs and explore the area directly to discover its full extent. Characters standing along the ledge can discern many large, dark stains on the rough floor at the base of the ledge, but what caused them is not apparent.": "从壁架上，人物可以在下面的黑暗中看清大蛋的形状（每个蛋几乎有三英尺高）。这个洞穴一直延伸到他们的光线范围之外的黑暗中。他们需要走下楼梯，直接探索这个区域，以发现它的全部范围。站在壁架上的人物可以看出壁架底部粗糙的地板上有许多大的黑斑，但造成这些黑斑的原因并不明显。",
	"This area is warm and humid. After characters look closely at the floor, they can determine that the stains are blood, and some of them are fresh. They come from the meat the kobolds toss down here.": "这个区域是温暖和潮湿的。在人物仔细观察地板后，他们可以确定这些污点是血迹，而且有些是新鲜的。它们来自哥布林人在这里扔下的肉。",
	"If the eggs are left here, they hatch in less than a week. If they are taken away, whether they hatch depends on how they are stored and treated. Away from a warm, humid environment such as this chamber, their progress halts until they are again in a suitable incubator. The dragons can be killed easily if the eggs are smashed, crushed, or stabbed. If an egg is simply cracked open, the infant dragon struggles for breath, cries and squirms like a human baby for a few minutes, and then dies.": "如果鸡蛋被留在这里，它们在不到一周的时间内就会孵化。如果它们被带走，它们是否孵化取决于它们的储存和处理方式。离开了像这个房间这样温暖潮湿的环境，它们的进展就会停止，直到它们再次进入一个合适的孵化器。如果鸡蛋被砸碎、压碎或刺伤，龙就很容易被杀死。如果鸡蛋被简单地敲开，幼龙会挣扎着呼吸，像人类婴儿一样哭闹，蠕动几分钟，然后死亡。",
	"Each creature within 10 feet of the bomb's target point must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take 4 ({@dice 1d8}) fire damage (half as much damage on a successful saving throw).": "炸弹目标点10英尺范围内的每个生物必须在DC 11的灵巧救赎中成功，否则会受到4({@dice 1d8})的火焰伤害（救赎成功时伤害为一半）。",
	"If all else fails, the kobolds scramble up their makeshift ladder and attack with their shortswords.": "如果一切都失败了，哥布林们就爬上他们临时搭建的梯子，用短剑攻击。",
	"{@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}) moved into this simple but comfortable chamber when the camp was abandoned. If no fight has occurred with the guards in area 12 and characters enter this chamber from {@area area 9|0c1|x}, then Mondath is here when they arrive. Guards in area 12 hear whatever happens in this chamber and respond dutifully.": "{@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}（见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}）在营地被遗弃时搬进了这个简单而舒适的房间。如果没有与12区的守卫发生争斗，并且角色从{@area area 9|0c1|x}进入这个房间，那么当他们到达时，蒙达斯就在这里。12区的守卫会听到这个房间里发生的任何事情，并尽职尽责地做出反应。",
	"Spread open on one of the tables is a simple map of the Greenfields area showing the villages the cult attacked and looted. An arrow is sketched in from the Greenfields toward the west and the town of Beregost on the Trade Way, where the arrow turns north. A separate sheet of paper that is covered with numerals in columns contains the note, \"Everything must be freighted north to Naerytar. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} allowed us to keep some pearls, a ring, and a handful of small stones.\" Other papers are of less interest; most of them have bad poetry about dragons.": "在其中一张桌子上摊开的是一张简单的绿野地区地图，显示了邪教所攻击和掠夺的村庄。一个箭头从绿原区向西勾勒，贸易路上的贝雷戈斯特镇，箭头在那里转向北方。一张单独的纸上用数字列着，上面写着：\"所有东西都必须向北运到Naerytar。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}允许我们保留一些珍珠、一枚戒指和一小撮小石头\"。其他的文件就不太感兴趣了，它们中的大多数都有关于龙的坏诗。",
	"The smaller chamber off the main one contains a bed, a trunk containing Mondath's clothes, and a second trunk containing Mondath's Cult of the Dragon regalia and a key to the chest in area 9. With this regalia, one person (preferably a human woman, but the clothing can be adjusted to fit a man) can be outfitted as a Wearer of Purple. It's worth noting that each Wearer of Purple's regalia is similar but unique, so high-ranking cult members are likely to recognize this regalia as Mondath's. When they see that the person wearing it is not Mondath, or if they know she is dead, alarm bells are guaranteed to go off.": "主房间外的小房间里有一张床，一个装着蒙达斯衣服的箱子，还有一个装着蒙达斯的龙之崇拜服饰的箱子和一把通往第9区箱子的钥匙。有了这些装备，一个人（最好是人类女性，但衣服可以调整为适合男性）可以被装备成紫色的穿戴者。值得注意的是，每个 \"紫色穿戴者 \"的服饰都是相似但独特的，所以高级邪教成员很可能会认出这套服饰是蒙达斯的。当他们看到穿着它的人不是蒙达斯，或者他们知道她已经死了，警钟一定会响起。",
	"If a fight breaks out in area 12 and four of the guards from that chamber retreat here to defend Mondath, her response is up to you. If the fight in the barracks takes a heavy toll on the characters, she might decide to confront them here. If the attackers plow through her forward guards, Mondath might retreat down the chute to area 9 and join forces with Cyanwrath or even flee from the cave. She has dedicated her life to the Cult of the Dragon, but she isn't eager to die for the cult. Mondath knows that the Cult is amassing treasure in the north and that {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} spoke often of Tiamat, but that is the extent of her knowledge of the larger plan.": "如果第12区发生了战斗，那间屋子里的四个卫兵退到这里来保卫蒙达斯，她的反应就取决于你。如果军营里的战斗对人物造成了很大的伤害，她可能会决定在这里与他们对峙。如果攻击者冲破了她的前卫，蒙达斯可能会顺着滑道撤退到第9区，与赛恩沃斯联手，甚至从洞穴里逃走。她已经把自己的生命献给了神龙教，但她并不急于为神龙教而死。蒙达斯知道邪教正在北方积聚财宝，而且{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}经常谈到提亚马特，但这是她对大计划的了解程度。",
	"The guards' scabbards are decorated with dragon motifs. They are worth about 5 gp each. They are not part of a Cult of the Dragon \"uniform,\" but wearing one of these scabbards could buy a character credibility when trying to pose as a cultist. For example, you might grant a +1 bonus to Charisma checks made to fool or influence cultists. Aside from their gear, the guards have coins and small gems worth a total of 120 gp.": "守卫的刀鞘上有龙的图案装饰。每个价值约5戈比。它们不属于神龙教的 \"制服\"，但在试图冒充邪教人士时，佩戴这些刀鞘可以为角色赢得信誉。例如，你可以在愚弄或影响邪教人员时，给予魅力检查+1的奖励。除了他们的装备外，卫兵们还有总价值为120金币的硬币和小宝石。",
	"Award standard XP for defeated foes. This chapter includes many challenges other than fights, and characters should be rewarded for overcoming them. The awards listed below are just recommendations; adjust them as you see fit. Characters might reach 4th level by the end of this chapter, but it's not essential that they do.": "为被打败的敌人奖励标准XP。本章包括许多战斗以外的挑战，角色克服了这些挑战就应该得到奖励。下面列出的奖励只是建议，你可以根据自己的需要进行调整。角色在本章结束时可能会达到4级，但这并不是必须的。",
	"If you are using the milestone experience rule, the characters reach 4th level.": "如果你使用的是里程碑式的经验规则，人物就达到了4级。",
	"For locating and disarming traps: 100 XP per trap.": "用于定位和解除陷阱。每个陷阱100XP。",
	"For offering the roper meat instead of fighting it to the death: 1,800 XP (the roper's standard XP value).": "因为提供给漫游者肉，而不是和它决一死战。1,800 XP(该牧羊人的标准XP值)。",
	"For each dragon egg destroyed or taken: 250 XP.": "每摧毁或夺取一个龙蛋。250XP。",
	"With the dragon hatchery destroyed and the cultists all gone, characters should head for Elturel and their rendezvous with {@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ} and {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}. They might choose to follow the wagon tracks instead. The wagons followed the course roughly laid out on the map in Mondath's chamber: west to Beregost, then north along the Trade Way. They have at least a full day's head start on the characters, and possibly more, depending on how much time characters spent in Greenest before returning to the plateau.": "随着龙的孵化场被摧毁，邪教分子全部消失，角色们应该前往Elturel，与{@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ}和{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}会合。他们可能会选择沿着马车的轨迹前进。马车沿着蒙达斯房间里的地图上的路线前进：向西到贝雷戈斯特，然后沿着贸易路向北。他们至少比人物领先了一整天，甚至可能更多，这取决于人物在返回高原之前在Greenest花了多少时间。",
	"The treasure looted from the Greenfields is headed north on the Trade Way, hidden in unmarked freight wagons that are part of the regular merchant traffic of that well-traveled road. The heroes must find out where all that loot is going, which means taking a long, danger-filled trip northward.": "从绿地掠夺来的财宝正沿着贸易之路北上，藏在没有标记的货运车中，这些车是这条康庄大道上正常商人交通的一部分。英雄们必须找出所有这些战利品的去向，这意味着要向北走一段漫长的、充满危险的旅程。",
	"The characters should travel from the abandoned cult camp southeast of Greenest to the city of Elturel on the River Chionthar. Their route takes them back through Greenest, where they can return any stolen goods that they recovered from the cult and recuperate from their wounds. Nighthill greets the characters with delight and respect. He tells them that before {@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ} left town, he bought horses and riding gear for the characters to speed their journey to Elturel. The horses are being kept at the dealer's stables until the characters are ready to leave for Elturel; all their costs are paid for.": "角色们应该从Greenest东南的废弃邪教营地出发，前往Chionthar河上的Elturel城市。他们的路线要经过格林斯特，在那里他们可以归还从邪教那里搜出的任何赃物，并休养伤势。奈特希尔高兴地迎接了这些人物，并表示尊重。他告诉他们，在{@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ}离开镇子之前，他为人物买了马和骑具，以加快他们去Elturel的旅程。这些马匹被存放在经销商的马厩里，直到人物准备好前往Elturel；他们的所有费用都已支付。",
	"On horseback, characters can travel the 200 miles from Greenest to Elturel in about six days. They make the journey without incident, unless you throw an encounter or two at them to spice up the trip or to increase their XP totals. Encounters with bandits, humanoid clans, and roving monsters are appropriate in the untamed expanses of the Greenfields.": "在马背上，角色们可以在六天内从格林斯特到艾尔崔尔走完200英里。他们在旅途中不会发生任何意外，除非你给他们带来一两个遭遇，以增加旅途的乐趣或增加他们的XP总量。遇到强盗、人形部族和游荡的怪物，在绿野的未开化地区是合适的。",
	"Elturel, a large, orderly city overlooking the River Chionthar, is filled with merchants, river traders, and farmers' markets. Its most distinguishing feature is a brilliant magical light that hovers above it, illuminating it day and night. This light is painful to undead and is visible from almost every corner of Elturgard (of which Elturel is the capital), appearing from afar as a star or distant sun.": "Elturel是一座俯瞰奇昂塔尔河的大型有序城市，到处都是商人、河贩和农贸市场。它最突出的特点是有一道灿烂的魔法之光，盘旋在它的上方，日夜照耀着它。这种光对亡灵来说是痛苦的，几乎从埃尔图尔加德（埃尔图尔是其首都）的每个角落都能看到，从远处看就像一颗星星或遥远的太阳。",
	"When the characters meet {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}, they find him to be a good-natured paladin of Torm, the god of heroics and bravery. He is a man of action who loves jokes and pranks, a stiff drink, and a friendly scuffle.": "当人物遇到{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}时，他们发现他是一个好脾气的托尔姆的圣骑士，托尔姆是英雄和勇敢之神。他是一个喜欢开玩笑和恶作剧的人，喜欢喝烈酒和友好的混战。",
	"You can spend as much or as little time on interactions in Elturel as you and your players want. Characters are guaranteed to have a good time in Frume's company, provided they consider continual drinking, arm-wrestling, horseback riding contests, sparring, and weapon training to be a good time. If the players don't realize it, Erlanthar finds a quiet moment to be sure the characters understand that impressing Frume with their prowess, their honesty, and their drive is in their long-term interest. The characters can make a positive impression on Frume by winning a few contests (resolved quickly with opposed skill or ability checks) or sparring matches against his troopers or by telling entertaining tales of their exploits during the Greenest raid, in the raiders' camp, and in the dragon caves.": "你可以根据你和你的玩家的需要，在Elturel的互动上花更多或更少的时间。只要角色认为不断地喝酒、掰手腕、骑马比赛、比武和武器训练是一种好时光，就能保证他们在弗鲁姆的公司里过得很开心。如果玩家们没有意识到这一点，Erlanthar会找一个安静的时刻来确保角色们明白，用他们的能力、他们的诚实和他们的动力来打动Frumm是符合他们长期利益的。角色们可以通过赢得一些竞赛（通过相反的技能或能力检查快速解决）或与他的部队进行比武，或者通过讲述他们在Greenest突袭中、在突袭者营地中和在龙洞中的有趣故事来给Frum留下积极印象。",
	"Late in the evening, after a day when Frume has been suitably impressed by the characters, he sends one of his squires to summon them to a private room in the tavern.": "在一天之后的深夜，弗鲁姆对这些人物留下了适当的印象，他派他的一个侍从把他们召集到酒馆的一个私人房间。",
	"Frume's squire shows you to a private space off the tavern's common room and closes the door when he leaves. Waiting for you in the room are the broad-shouldered human paladin, the monk Leosin, and many pitchers of dark red wine. The paladin's face wears a serious expression, unlike its usual open countenance.": "弗鲁姆的侍从带你到酒馆公共房间外的一个私人空间，他离开时关上了门。在房间里等着你的是宽肩的人类圣骑士、修士Leosin和许多投掷的暗红色葡萄酒。圣骑士的脸上带着严肃的表情，与平时开放的面孔不同。",
	"\"My friends, we have important business to discuss. At this point, you know almost as much about it as we do, and thanks to you, we know twice as much today as we did a tenday ago. Something rotten is afoot. We have no formal organization to oppose these rascals—not yet anyway. We're working on that. And we need people like you, who know how and when to fight, and how and when to keep their heads down and observe. We can't promise you anything except long days filled with danger and stress—but what could be better than that, eh?\"": "\"我的朋友们，我们有重要的事情要讨论。在这一点上，你们知道的几乎和我们一样多，而且多亏了你们，我们今天知道的东西是一天前的两倍。腐朽的东西正在酝酿。我们没有正式的组织来反对这些流氓--反正还没有。我们正在努力解决这个问题。我们需要像你这样的人，知道如何和何时战斗，以及如何和何时保持低头观察。除了充满危险和压力的漫长日子，我们不能向你承诺什么--但还有什么比这更好的呢，嗯？",
	"{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ} and {@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ}, along with a handful of other concerned leaders and scholars along the Sword Coast, are in the early stages of organizing against the Cult of the Dragon.": "{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}和{@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ}，以及剑海岸的其他一些相关领导人和学者，正处于组织起来反对神龙教的早期阶段。",
	"Erlanthar's organization is the Harpers. Characters might have heard of the older Harpers, but they're unlikely to know much about the secretive group beyond what is generally rumored: that the Harpers are dedicated to furthering equality and justice and to keeping power out of the hands of those who don't deserve it. Erlanthar explains that the Harpers are loosely organized; agents are allowed wide freedom of action.": "Erlanthar的组织是Harpers。角色们可能听说过老一辈的哈珀斯，但他们不可能对这个神秘的组织有太多的了解，除了一般的传闻：哈珀斯致力于促进平等和正义，不让权力落入那些不值得的人手中。Erlanthar解释说，哈珀斯组织很松散；代理人被允许有广泛的行动自由。",
	"{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ} represents the Order of the Gauntlet. His order shares many of the Harpers' principles, but the two organizations are very different. The Order of the Gauntlet emphasizes faith, vigilance, and constant struggle against threats of evil. Many of its members are clerics and paladins, but the order welcomes anyone who shares its ideals. Discipline is key, and the order is distinctly more structured and hierarchical than the Harpers.": "{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}代表高塔骑士团。他的组织与哈珀斯的许多原则相同，但这两个组织却非常不同。高塔骑士团强调信仰、警惕和与邪恶威胁的不断斗争。它的许多成员是牧师和圣骑士，但该组织欢迎任何与它有共同理想的人。纪律是关键，而且该组织明显比哈珀斯组织更有结构性和等级性。",
	"The top concern of both groups is the Cult of the Dragon. In the past, the cult was more active to the east and it was focused on creating dracoliches. Its shift to the Sword Coast and new emphasis on living dragons and on Tiamat are cause for concern. The cult is on the move and it's up to something big; the Order of the Gauntlet, the Harpers, and a third allied group known as the Emerald Enclave want to thwart the cult's plans.": "这两个团体最关心的问题是龙的崇拜。在过去，该邪教在东部比较活跃，它专注于创造龙族。它向剑海岸的转移以及对活龙和提亚马特的新强调，都令人担忧。该邪教正在行动，并在酝酿一件大事；高塔骑士团、哈珀斯和第三个被称为翡翠飞地的联盟组织想要挫败该邪教的计划。",
	"In this meeting, Frume and Erlanthar are offering the characters the chance to join their factions. At this early stage, there is no pay for members and there are no ranks. What they can offer is help and support from other members and allies, who are spread from Nashkel and Candlekeep in the south to Neverwinter and Mirabar in the north. The horses that Erlanthar arranged for the characters are just one small example of the aid the Harpers and the Order of the Gauntlet can provide.": "在这次会议中，Frumm和Erlanthar为人物提供了加入他们派系的机会。在这个早期阶段，成员没有报酬，也没有等级。他们能提供的是来自其他成员和盟友的帮助和支持，他们分布在南部的纳什克尔和烛台镇到北部的永夜城和米拉巴尔。Erlanthar为人物安排的马匹只是哈珀斯和高塔骑士团可以提供的援助的一个小例子。",
	"Harpers can be recognized by the group's symbol: a silver harp nestled between the horns of a crescent moon. Some people wear the symbol openly, and others keep it concealed. Erlanthar wears his as a medallion around his neck when he is certain that he's not heading into a potential captive situation—sometimes openly and sometimes tucked away. Members of the Order of the Gauntlet wear their holy symbols openly. (Frume's is the right-handed gauntlet of Torm.) The order's universal symbol is a gauntlet grasping a sword by the blade. Frume wears such a symbol on a pendant around his neck, hidden below his flowing beard.": "哈珀人可以通过该团体的标志来识别：一个银色的竖琴依偎在一个新月的犄角之间。有些人公开佩戴这个标志，有些人则将其隐藏起来。埃兰萨在确定自己没有进入潜在的俘虏情况时，就把他的徽章戴在脖子上--有时是公开的，有时是藏起来的。高塔骑士团的成员公开佩戴他们的神圣标志。(Frumume的是Torm的右手铠甲。)该组织的通用标志是一个抓住剑刃的铠甲。弗鲁姆把这样的标志戴在脖子上的吊坠上，藏在他飘逸的胡须下面。",
	"Characters don't need to join either faction, but there are advantages to doing so and no real drawbacks. Even if characters don't agree to join, Frume and Erlanthar try to enlist their aid in tracking the cult's shipments.": "角色不需要加入任何一个派别，但这样做有好处，没有真正的坏处。即使角色不同意加入，弗鲁姆和埃兰萨也会试图让他们协助追踪邪教的货物。",
	"Thanks to the characters, the Harpers now know that the cult is amassing treasure and shipping it north. Where exactly this treasure is going and what the cult plans to do with it are the next two questions that need answering. Frume and Erlanthar would like the characters to join the cult's caravan and accompany it on the journey. They could get themselves hired as guards—if not by the cult's wagon masters, then by other merchants who are traveling in the same direction at the same time. Merchants from different companies commonly join together to form larger trains for protection. Frume has contacts among the many merchants of the region and is certain he can arrange a job.": "多亏了这些人物，哈珀人现在知道邪教正在收集财宝并将其运往北方。接下来需要回答的两个问题是：这些财宝到底要去哪里，以及邪教打算用这些财宝做什么。Frume和Erlanthar希望角色们能加入邪教的商队，并在旅途中陪伴它。他们可以让自己被雇佣为卫兵--如果不是被邪教的马车主人雇佣，那就是被同时朝同一方向旅行的其他商人雇佣。来自不同公司的商人通常会联合起来，组成更大的列车以获得保护。弗鲁姆在这一地区的许多商人中都有联系，他肯定能安排一份工作。",
	"Timing is an issue. The tracks leaving the cultists' camp and the map from Mondath's chamber both indicate that the wagons were heading west to pick up the Coast Way road, where they would turn north to Beregost and Baldur's Gate, a journey of about 550 miles. The wagons would take twenty-five to thirty days for that trip, depending on conditions. The wagons pulled out at least a day ahead of the characters' return to the camp, and the characters probably spent a day exploring the abandoned camp and clearing out the dragon hatchery. Returning to Greenest, resting, and traveling to Elturel account for eight to ten more days. Unless the characters walked to Elturel or lounged for days in Greenest before coming north, they should have at least ten to fifteen days before the cult's wagons reach Baldur's Gate.": "时间是个问题。离开邪教徒营地的足迹和蒙达斯密室的地图都表明，马车正向西驶去，准备走上海岸路，在那里他们将向北转到贝雷戈斯特和博德之门，行程约550英里。根据情况，马车需要二十五到三十天的时间来完成这一行程。马车至少比人物返回营地的时间提前一天停靠，人物可能花了一天时间探索废弃的营地，并清理了龙的孵化场。回到Greenest，休息一下，然后去Elturel，这需要八到十天。除非人物是步行到Elturel，或者在北上之前在Greenest闲逛了好几天，否则在邪教的马车到达Baldur's Gate之前，他们应该至少有10到15天的时间。",
	"The River Chionthar flows directly from Elturel to Baldur's Gate. A sailing vessel can make that trip downstream in about three days if it ties up overnight for safety, or two if it risks pushing on through the night by lamplight. Frume has already arranged for such a boat to leave at dawn the next morning. They are also provided with 50 gp each to cover expenses on the trip.": "奇昂塔尔河从艾尔图勒直接流向博德之门。如果为了安全起见，一艘帆船可以在三天内顺流而下，如果冒险在夜里借着灯火继续前进，则需要两天。弗鲁姆已经安排好了这样一艘船，在第二天早上的黎明离开。还为他们每人提供了50戈比，以支付此行的费用。",
	"If the characters turn down this mission, Frume makes some remarks about how they aren't the people he thought they were, and he leaves the meeting more than a little bit angry. Erlanthar stays and makes one more appeal to their sense of honor and duty. If the characters still turn him down, he reaches into his tunic and pulls out a soft leather pouch, which he hands to one of the characters. Inside is a magnificent ruby worth 1,200 gp. He explains that if they take the mission, this ruby will be waiting for them in the hands of a Harper agent in Waterdeep.": "如果这些人物拒绝了这个任务，弗鲁姆就会说他们不是他认为的那种人，他就会离开会议，而且有点生气。Erlanthar留下来，再次呼吁他们的荣誉感和责任感。如果这些人物仍然拒绝他，他就把手伸进他的外衣，掏出一个软皮袋，递给其中一个人物。里面是一颗华丽的红宝石，价值1,200戈比。他解释说，如果他们接受了这个任务，这颗红宝石就会在沃特迪普的一个哈珀特工手中等待他们。",
	"That night, Frume sees that the characters are all equipped with new clothing and gear, and even new weapons if they want. He suggests that they change their appearance as much as they can in simple ways, to reduce the odds of anyone they might have met at the cult camp recognizing them.": "那天晚上，弗鲁姆看到人物都配备了新的衣服和装备，如果他们愿意，甚至还有新的武器。他建议他们尽可能以简单的方式改变自己的外表，以减少他们在邪教营地可能遇到的人认出他们的几率。",
	"The trip downriver to Baldur's Gate is uneventful, regardless of whether it takes three days or two. The characters can bring their horses along on the boat if they wish. The horses won't like it, but they'll manage.": "顺流而下到Baldur's Gate的旅程并不顺利，不管是花三天还是两天。如果他们愿意，人物可以把他们的马带上船。马匹不会喜欢这样，但它们可以应付。",
	"Baldur's Gate is a bustling center of trade, with goods coming from north and south by wagon along the Trade Way and by ship on the Sea of Swords, and from the east along the River Chionthar and from Cormyr and Sembia. Baldur's Gate is situated on a prominent bluff next to the river, overlooking an excellent natural harbor. It is divided into three distinct segments: the Upper City where the richest and most influential citizens live and where the city's marketplace (the Wide) is located; the Lower City, which surrounds the harbor and where most of the city's merchants live and conduct their business; and the Outer City, which lies outside the walls and where most of the city's laborers reside in conditions that vary from crowded but clean to squalid.": "博德之门是一个繁华的贸易中心，货物从北方和南方沿贸易之路、从剑海乘船而来，从东方沿奇安塔尔河、从科米尔和森比亚而来。博德之门位于河边一个突出的悬崖上，俯瞰着一个绝佳的天然港口。它被分为三个不同的部分：上城，最富有和最有影响力的公民居住在这里，城市的市场（Wide）也在这里；下城，围绕着港口，城市的大多数商人居住在这里并开展业务；外城，位于城墙外，城市的大多数劳动者居住在这里，条件从拥挤但干净到肮脏不等。",
	"Depending on timing, characters might have just a few days to wait in Baldur's Gate, or up to a tenday. Most of that time should be spent contacting a merchant recommended by Frume and arranging affairs so they can spot the cult wagons when they arrive.": "根据时间安排，人物可能只有几天的时间在Baldur's Gate等待，或者长达一个工作日。其中大部分时间应该用来联系Frumm推荐的商人，并安排好事务，以便他们在邪教马车到达时能够发现。",
	"Frume's contact is a human trader named Ackyn Selebon. He operates an equipage business in the Outer City north of the city wall, in a district called Blackgate. There he sells all the material needed for long-distance freight hauling: wagons, rope, netting, grease, chains, wheels, and so on. His shop also repairs wagons. He is not directly involved in the hiring of guards for caravans, but he knows people who are. With him to vouch for the characters, they should have no trouble getting hired on as guards for a northbound caravan, but he can't give them work with a specific merchant.": "弗鲁姆的联系人是一个名叫Ackyn Selebon的人类商人。他在城墙以北的外城经营装备生意，在一个叫黑门的地区。他在那里出售长途货运所需的所有材料：马车、绳子、网子、油脂、链条、车轮等等。他的商店还修理马车。他不直接参与雇佣商队的守卫，但他认识一些人。有了他的担保，他们被雇用为北行商队的守卫应该没有问题，但他不能给他们提供特定商人的工作。",
	"Baldur's Gate doesn't allow wagons, pack animals, horses, or even dogs into the city. The streets are so narrow, steep, and slick from frequent rain that heavy wagons would be a menace. This is actually one of the reasons why Baldur's Gate is such a bustling commercial hub: for goods to pass through the city from south to north, for example, they must be unloaded in the Outer City east of the wall, carried through the city by porters on foot, and reloaded onto different wagons north of the city for the rest of their journey. No road conveniently bypasses the city—a situation that the gate's profiteering intermediaries work hard to maintain. Most merchants find it easier to sell their loads to those intermediaries and consignment dealers when they reach Baldur's Gate, buy a new load of exotic goods from somewhere far away, and turn around and head back home, where they can again sell the new goods at a profit.": "博德之门不允许马车、驮兽、马，甚至狗进入城市。街道非常狭窄、陡峭，而且经常下雨导致路面湿滑，沉重的马车会成为一种威胁。这实际上也是博德之门成为如此繁华的商业中心的原因之一：例如，货物要从南到北通过城市，必须在城墙以东的外城卸货，由搬运工人步行穿过城市，然后重新装到城北的不同马车上，继续他们的旅程。没有任何道路可以方便地绕过城市--这是城门的暴利中间商努力维持的局面。大多数商人发现，当他们到达博德门时，更容易将他们的货物卖给那些中间商和寄售商，从很远的地方买一车新的异国货物，然后转身回家，在那里他们可以再次出售新的货物以获得利润。",
	"Along with wagons, guards seldom make a continuous journey through Baldur's Gate. Guards for northbound caravans are typically hired in Blackgate where northbound wagons begin their journey. Selebon tells the characters that if they hang around any of the taverns or tent saloons near his shop, they are sure to see all the northbound traffic. They shouldn't hesitate to use him as a reference if a potential employer asks for one.": "伴随着马车，守卫很少会在博德之门中进行连续的旅行。北行商队的守卫通常是在黑门雇佣的，北行的马车在那里开始他们的旅程。塞勒本告诉人物，如果他们在他的商店附近的任何一家酒馆或帐篷沙龙里闲逛，他们肯定会看到所有北行的交通。如果有潜在的雇主问起，他们应该毫不犹豫地把他作为一个参考。",
	"The northbound journey from Baldur's Gate is arduous, so merchants travel together for safety. Each merchant hires guards independently, but the common belief is that if everyone hires two or three and enough wagons travel together, the caravan is well protected.": "从博德之门向北的旅程很艰辛，所以商人们为了安全而结伴而行。每个商人都独立地雇佣卫兵，但人们普遍认为，如果每个人都雇佣两到三个卫兵，并且有足够多的马车一起旅行，商队就会得到很好的保护。",
	"Within a few days (the wait is up to you and the timing you've worked out for the cargo's arrival from the camp), characters spot people they recognize from the cult's camp on the plateau. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}, being a half-dragon, can't travel openly in Baldur's Gate; she'd be attacked by a mob. The city's wealthy elite, however, often travel the streets in screened or curtained palanquins for both comfort and privacy. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} does the same. When characters spot familiar faces from the cult camp, the cultists are carrying or accompanying a palanquin where {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} rides. They might catch a glimpse of her through a briefly parted curtain if they're observant.": "在几天内（等待的时间取决于你和你为货物从营地到达的时间），角色们发现了他们在高原上的邪教营地里认识的人。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}，作为一个半龙人，不能在博德之门公开旅行；她会被暴徒袭击的。然而，这个城市的富有的精英们，为了舒适和隐私，经常乘坐有屏风或窗帘的轿子在街上行走。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}也是如此。当人物发现邪教阵营中熟悉的面孔时，这些邪教人员正带着或伴随着{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}乘坐的轿子。如果他们善于观察，可能会透过短暂分开的帘子瞥见她。",
	"{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} and her bodyguards come to Selebon's yard to purchase five wagons and supplies (having sold the other wagons south of the city). Once they are equipped, local porters pack merchandise and supplies onto the wagons, cover them in canvas, and lash them down.": "{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}和她的保镖来到塞勒邦的院子里，购买五辆马车和物资（已将其他马车卖到城南）。装备好后，当地的搬运工将商品和物资装上马车，用帆布盖住，然后用绳子绑住。",
	"No one is interested in hiring the character, but he or she can tag along as a traveler. Guards sometimes quit or die on the road, and a replacement has a chance to find employment.": "没有人有兴趣雇用这个角色，但他或她可以作为一个旅行者跟在后面。警卫有时会辞职或死在路上，而替代者有机会找到工作。",
	"Hired as a basic guard for 5 gp per tenday, plus food and living expenses on the road.": "被雇为基本的警卫，每个工作日5个金币，外加路上的食物和生活费用。",
	"Hired as a sergeant for 8 gp per tenday, plus food and living expenses on the road.": "被聘为中士，每班8戈比，外加路上的食物和生活费。",
	"Hired as a bodyguard for the merchant at 10 gp per tenday, plus food and living expenses on the road.": "受雇为商人的保镖，每个工作日10金币，外加路上的食物和生活费。",
	"All hires are for the journey to Waterdeep. Sergeants are expected to manage two to five other guards. Bodyguards are expected to stick close to their employer and protect him or her against harm.": "所有雇佣的人都是为了前往沃特德普的旅程。中士要管理两到五个其他的卫兵。保镖们要紧跟他们的雇主，保护他或她免受伤害。",
	"During the course of this journey, the characters have opportunities to meet a range of people from across Faerûn. Merchants, mercenaries, pilgrims, scholars, thieves, and explorers all mingle on the great Trade Way.": "在这个旅程中，人物有机会遇到来自整个法鲁恩的各种人。商人、佣兵、朝圣者、学者、盗贼和探险家都在这条伟大的贸易之路上打交道。",
	"{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12} for statistics) is a male human and a Red Wizard of Thay. Red Wizards are widely disliked and mistrusted, so he takes some pains to disguise his membership in that group by always wearing a wool cap with ear and neck flaps to cover his shaved, tattooed head. It's not an especially effective disguise; characters who make a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check notice the edges of the tattoos peeking out from under the cap. Many Thayans have shaved, tattooed heads, however, but only a few are Red Wizards. Countless Thayans fled their country when the lich Szass Tam seized control, so they are not entirely strange on the Sword Coast. If questioned, Jos claims to be just another Thayan expatriot trying to find refuge while his country is controlled by undead monsters. In fact, other than the denial that he's a Red Wizard, this is all true.": "{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}（统计数字见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}）是一名男性人类，是泰伊的红袍巫师。红袍巫师被广泛厌恶和不信任，所以他花了一些心思来掩饰他的成员身份，他总是戴着一顶有耳翼和颈翼的羊毛帽来遮住他剃光的、有纹身的头。这并不是一种特别有效的伪装；通过DC15智慧({@skill Perception})检查的人物会注意到纹身的边缘从帽子下探出。然而，许多泰雅人都剃了头，纹了身，但只有少数人是红袍巫师。当巫师萨斯-塔姆夺取控制权时，无数的泰雅人逃离了他们的国家，所以他们在剑海岸并不完全陌生。如果被询问，乔斯声称自己只是另一个试图在他的国家被不死怪物控制时找到避难所的泰雅族侨民。事实上，除了否认他是红袍巫师之外，这些都是事实。",
	"Jos buys space aboard one of the cult wagons, although they turned away everyone else who sought passage earlier in the journey. He does not mingle with the other travelers and seldom speaks to anyone except the man who seems to be the leader of the cultists.": "乔斯买了一辆邪教马车的空间，尽管他们拒绝了早些时候寻求通过的所有人。他不与其他旅行者打成一片，除了那个似乎是邪教领袖的人之外，他很少与其他人说话。",
	"{@creature Jamna Gleamsilver|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12} for statistics) is a female gnome and a member of a secretive organization called the Black Network, also known as the Zhentarim. Outwardly, the Black Network provides mercenaries and other forms of muscle for hire. Informally, it is known as a criminal society akin to a widespread thieves guild. Secretly, its leaders seek to extend their shadowy fingers into every throne room and ruling council chamber in Faerûn. Like the Harpers, the Zhentarim too are aware that the Cult of the Dragon is on the move, and they need to know the cult's plans so they can prevent them from interfering with the Zhentarim's own plans, plus perhaps take advantage of the plunder possibilities.": "{@creature Jamna Gleamsilver|HotDQ}(统计数字见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12})是一个女地精，是一个叫黑网的秘密组织的成员，也被称为Zhentarim。外表上，黑网提供雇佣兵和其他形式的雇佣兵。非正式地，它被称为是一个类似于广泛的盗贼公会的犯罪团体。暗地里，它的领导人试图将他们阴暗的手指伸向法鲁恩的每一个王室和统治者的议事厅。和哈珀人一样，真塔林也知道神龙教在行动，他们需要知道神龙教的计划，以便防止他们干扰真塔林自己的计划，也许还能利用掠夺的可能性。",
	"That's why Gleamsilver joins the caravan. The Black Network's spies learned that the cult is moving freight northward, and, like the characters, she was tasked with finding out what they're hauling and where it's headed. Those above her seriously considered wiping out the caravan with mercenaries disguised as bandits, ransacking the wagons, and torturing cult members for the desired information. Fortunately for the characters, Gleamsilver persuaded her superiors to give her a shot at uncovering the truth in a less bloody fashion. If she hasn't come up with something useful by the time the caravan reaches Waterdeep, she will put plan B—the one involving mass murder—into action.": "这就是格莱姆希尔弗加入商队的原因。黑网的间谍了解到邪教正在向北运输货物，和这些人物一样，她的任务是找出他们所运的货物以及货物的目的地。她上面的人认真考虑用伪装成强盗的雇佣兵消灭商队，洗劫马车，并折磨邪教成员以获得所需的信息。幸运的是，Gleamsilver说服了她的上级，让她以一种不那么血腥的方式来揭开真相。如果在商队到达沃特迪普时，她还没有想出有用的办法，她就会把B计划--涉及大规模谋杀的计划--付诸行动。",
	"Despite the vast gulf between their outlooks, the Black Network and the Harpers have a common enemy, and that is pushing them into an unlikely alliance. Gleamsilver is the antithesis of a hero—she is self-serving, a skilled thief and liar, and willing to murder anyone who stands between her and her goal.": "尽管他们的观点之间存在着巨大的差距，但黑网和哈珀斯有一个共同的敌人，这正促使他们结成一个不太可能的联盟。Gleamsilver是英雄的对立面--她自私自利，是一个熟练的小偷和骗子，并愿意谋杀任何阻挡她和她的目标的人。",
	"This list of twenty NPCs is provided for when you need one quickly. You can, of course, change any details about them that you wish. Use them to flesh out the caravan, to spice up the journey, to help bring the trip to life, and to give characters people to like and protect, or dislike and quarrel with, along the way.": "这二十个NPC的名单是为你快速需要时提供的。当然，你可以根据自己的意愿改变他们的任何细节。用他们来充实大篷车的内容，为旅程增添色彩，使旅程充满生机，并为角色提供喜欢和保护的人，或不喜欢和争吵的人，在一路上。",
	"Ulyeltin is an independent wagon master with two wagons in this caravan. Both are hauling cured furs and uncured hides. He is a boorish man without a trace of civilization about him. He's not unfriendly—just smelly, vulgar, and utterly without manners. His second wagon driver and two laborers, on the other hand, are perfectly pleasant.": "Ulyeltin是一个独立的马车主人，在这个商队中有两辆马车。两辆马车都在拉运腌制的毛皮和未腌制的兽皮。他是一个粗野的人，身上没有一丝文明气息。他不是不友好，只是臭气熏天，粗俗不堪，而且完全没有礼貌。另一方面，他的第二个马车夫和两个工人则非常讨人喜欢。",
	"A lawyer by training but a skunk by inclination, Urnpoleshurst is relocating from Baldur's Gate to anywhere that isn't Baldur's Gate. Gossip around the caravan is that he was driven out by a scandal, and that's hard not to believe. He is suspicious of everyone and makes outrageous accusations at the drop of a hat.": "厄恩波利斯特受训为律师，但倾向于臭鼬，他正从博德之门搬迁到任何不是博德之门的地方。商队周围的流言蜚语说他是被丑闻赶出来的，这很难不让人相信。他对每个人都心存疑虑，一言不合就提出离谱的指控。",
	"Ale and beer are so common that not much money can be made hauling them long distances. But that's what fills Sechepol's wagon. He will make his money on the road, selling his stock to his fellow travelers in the caravan. He is diplomatic and has a gift for defusing arguments to everyone's satisfaction before they escalate to violence, but he is careless about gear and horses—a fault that can cause friction with those who hate to see a horse mistreated through thoughtlessness.": "麦芽酒和啤酒是如此的普通，以至于远距离运输它们并不能赚到多少钱。但这就是塞克波尔的马车所装的东西。他要在路上赚钱，把他的存货卖给商队里的同伴。他是个外交家，有在争论升级为暴力之前化解争论的天赋，让每个人都满意，但他对装备和马匹很粗心--这个缺点会引起与那些讨厌看到马匹因不经意而被虐待的人的摩擦。",
	"Lewel's wagon is loaded with exotic wood from the Jungle of Chult for the master carpenters and cabinetmakers of Waterdeep to turn into exquisite furniture. She is the exact opposite of Beyd Sechepol in temperament: impatient with people but exacting about her wagon and doting on her animals.": "Lewel的马车装满了来自Chult丛林的奇异木材，供Waterdeep的木匠大师和橱柜制造商将其变成精美的家具。她的性情与贝德-塞克波完全相反：对人不耐烦，但对她的马车要求严格，对她的动物也很宠爱。",
	"Agetul has made this trip several times before and never hesitates to wave that experience in others' faces. She is a perfectionist, and she wants others to know it.": "阿吉图以前已经做过几次这样的旅行，并且从不犹豫地在别人面前挥舞这种经验。她是一个完美主义者，她想让别人知道这一点。",
	"Tobun has driven freight wagons across Faerûn for the past forty years, from Waterdeep to Calimport and from Baldur's Gate to Hillsfar. He is a font of stories and legends, but it's impossible to tell the truth from fiction in his tales. If anyone challenges him on the truth of a story, he grows argumentative, then sullen and vengeful. As long as a traveler stays on his good side, Tobun is a wonderful traveling companion.": "过去四十年来，托本驾驶货运马车穿越法鲁恩，从沃特迪普到卡林波特，从博德之门到希尔斯法尔。他是故事和传说的源泉，但在他的故事中不可能分辨出真相与虚构。如果有人对他的故事的真实性提出质疑，他就会变得争论不休，然后闷闷不乐，充满报复性。只要旅行者站在他的立场上，托本就是一个很好的旅行伙伴。",
	"The reason behind Imsa's name is obvious: she is green from head to foot. Her skin, hair, eyes, nails, teeth—everything about her is green. She readily admits that she is traveling to Waterdeep in search of a remedy for her condition. The coloration doesn't seem to bother her, but she becomes flustered if anyone asks how she came to be this way. She is friendly, if somewhat quiet, as long as the conversation stays away from her past.": "伊姆萨的名字背后的原因很明显：她从头到脚都是绿色的。她的皮肤、头发、眼睛、指甲、牙齿--她的所有东西都是绿色的。她欣然承认，她到沃特德普是为了寻找治疗她病情的方法。这种颜色似乎并不妨碍她，但如果有人问她是如何变成这样的，她就会变得很慌张。她很友好，虽然有些沉默，但只要谈话不涉及她的过去。",
	"This ambitious merchant is hauling scented cooking oil and perfumes from Amn, hoping to make a huge profit from the aristocrats and dandies of Waterdeep. He talks about money constantly: how much he intends to make, how he will spend it, and how others will envy him for it. He will not spend a single copper buying anyone else a drink or a roasted turnip during the entire trip.": "这个雄心勃勃的商人正在从阿姆拉运芳香的食用油和香水，希望从水底世界的贵族和花花公子那里赚取巨额利润。他不停地谈论钱：他打算赚多少钱，他将如何花钱，以及其他人将如何羡慕他的钱。在整个行程中，他不会花一个铜板请别人喝酒或吃烤萝卜。",
	"From time to time, Lasfelro inexplicably breaks into merry songs and short stretches of joke-telling. His voice is a fine tenor and his jokes are hilarious. But these gregarious moods are always short. The rest of the time, he is silent as the grave, staring sullenly at the road ahead, barely moving on the seat of his wagon, seeming hardly to breathe. No one knows what he transports in his wagon, but it is guarded by a brooding gargoyle that is tethered to the wagon by a slim, silver chain.": "拉斯费罗不时莫名其妙地闯入欢乐的歌曲和短促的笑话。他的声音是一个很好的男高音，他的笑话也很搞笑。但这些欢快的情绪总是很短暂。其余的时间，他像坟墓一样沉默不语，闷闷不乐地盯着前面的路，在马车的座位上几乎不动，似乎几乎不呼吸。没有人知道他的马车里装的是什么，但它被一只忧郁的妖怪看守着，这只妖怪被一条细长的银链拴在马车上。",
	"Widris is as honest and courageous as mercenaries come. She has spent many years in the south and now wants to see the snows and frozen seas of the far north and experience what a truly cold wind feels like.": "维德里斯和雇佣兵一样诚实和勇敢。她在南方呆了很多年，现在想去看看遥远的北方的雪和冰冻的海洋，体验一下真正的寒风是什么感觉。",
	"Although Losvius's nose is respectably large, even for a halfling, the appellation Longnose was hung on him for a different reason: he is curious about everything, including other people's business, and especially other people's embarrassing secrets. Losvius doesn't poke his nose where it's not wanted in a search for blackmail material. He is just overpoweringly curious about what other people don't talk about. If he is along, there's a good chance one or more of the characters will find him nosing through their belongings when he thought their backs were turned.": "虽然洛斯维乌斯的鼻子相当大，即使对一个半身人来说也是如此，但长鼻子这个称谓被挂在他身上是出于另一个原因：他对一切都很好奇，包括别人的事情，尤其是别人的尴尬秘密。洛斯维尤斯并不是为了寻找敲诈的材料而把鼻子探到不需要的地方。他只是对别人不说的事有强烈的好奇心。如果他在一起，很有可能一个或更多的人物会发现他在他们认为他们背对着他们的时候偷看他们的物品。",
	"Noohar and his mute brother, Selvek, are hauling exquisite wooden carvings made by the elves of Cormyr. Where his brother communicates only through sign language, Noohar may be the most articulate person the characters have ever met. Speech springs from him like music from the harp of Milil. The fact that he seldom has anything to say never seems to stop him from talking or others from listening.": "努哈尔和他的哑巴哥哥塞尔维克正在拖运科米尔精灵制作的精美木雕作品。他的哥哥只能通过手语进行交流，而努哈尔可能是这些人物所见过的最能说会道的人。言语从他口中涌出，就像米利尔的竖琴发出的音乐。他很少有话可说，但这似乎并不妨碍他说话，也不妨碍别人倾听。",
	"A load of Calishite silk will make Nyerhite Verther a rich man in Waterdeep, or so he believes. Sadly, he did not inspect his silk carefully when he bought it, and it's infested with worms. If anyone spots them and points them out to Verther during the trip, he becomes unhinged in his anger and grief.": "一批卡利希特的丝绸将使尼尔赫特-维瑟成为水底世界的富人，他是这么认为的。可悲的是，他在买丝的时候没有仔细检查，丝上有虫子出没。如果在旅途中有人发现它们并向维瑟指出它们，他就会在愤怒和悲伤中变得不正常。",
	"Esseren grew up in the farmland outside Baldur's Gate, and this is her first trip more than two miles away from home. She is smart, tough, and talented with both spear and bow, but she knows nothing of the world beyond her aunt's farm or of people who deal dishonestly. Her aunt, a wise woman, believes this trip will be good for her.": "艾瑟伦在博德之门外的农田里长大，这是她第一次离家超过两英里的旅行。她很聪明，很坚强，对长矛和弓箭都很有天赋，但她对她姨妈的农场以外的世界和不诚实交易的人一无所知。她的姨妈是个聪明的女人，相信这次旅行对她有好处。",
	"Evenmor is an independent wagon master hauling exotic birds to the lucrative markets in Waterdeep. He is a stubborn, argumentative man with strong opinions about almost everything, but he is generous when it comes to pouring drinks for those who will sit and argue with him endlessly.": "埃文摩尔是一个独立的马车主人，将异国的鸟类拉到沃特德普有利可图的市场。他是一个顽固的、爱争论的人，对几乎所有的事情都有强烈的意见，但当他为那些愿意坐下来和他争论不休的人倒酒时，他很慷慨。",
	"No one knows where Perethun is ultimately headed or why. He eats alone, seldom speaks, and always rides in the back of the wagon, staring wistfully at the road gone by. The only thing that brings him out of this shell is a game of chance. He gambles boisterously and well.": "没有人知道Perethun最终会去哪里，也没有人知道为什么。他独自吃饭，很少说话，总是坐在马车的后面，怀念地凝视着过去的道路。唯一能让他走出这层壳的是一场机会游戏。他赌得很欢，赌得很好。",
	"Perhaps someone who hauls crates of expensive, fragile porcelain in a bouncing, jarring wagon along the Trade Way must be a born optimist. In Samardag's world, the sky is always blue, the weather is always fine, and the outlook for tomorrow is always bright. Odds are he would be a wealthy man if he hung onto his money, but he is a soft touch for every urchin and hard-luck story that crosses his path.": "也许一个在贸易路上用颠簸的马车拖着一箱箱昂贵而脆弱的瓷器的人，一定是个天生的乐观主义者。在萨马尔达格的世界里，天空总是很蓝，天气总是很好，明天的前景总是很光明。如果他抓住他的钱，他可能会成为一个富有的人，但他对每一个与他擦肩而过的顽童和不幸的故事都很宽容。",
	"Among his tribe in his homeland of the Shaar, Sulesdeg's name means \"tall as a lodge pole.\" On the Sword Coast, he is just known as \"the Pole.\" At 7 feet 5 inches in height, he probably is the tallest human the characters or anyone else in the caravan has ever seen. He doesn't talk much, but when he does, people generally listen.": "在他的故乡沙尔的部落中，苏勒德格的名字的意思是 \"像小屋的柱子一样高\"。在剑海岸，他只是被称为 \"柱子\"。他身高7英尺5英寸，可能是大篷车上的人物或其他任何人见过的最高的人类。他不怎么说话，但当他说话时，人们一般都会听。",
	"It won't take long before everyone in the caravan knows to steer clear of Tyjit Skesh. She is quick to anger and quicker to resort to her blades when something sets her off. She is honest to a fault and never fails to let people know why she was angry, so they can correct their behavior in the future. She will not tolerate bullying.": "用不了多久，商队里的每个人都知道要避开泰吉特-斯凯什。她很快就会发怒，当有事情让她发怒时，她会更快地诉诸于她的刀片。她诚实到了极点，从不吝啬让人知道她为什么生气，这样他们就能在将来纠正自己的行为。她不会容忍欺凌行为。",
	"Quiet, unassuming Werond Torohar can handle a team of horses or mules better than anyone on the Trade Way. She has an uncanny knack for making animals understand what she wants from them with only a twitch on the reins, a whistle, and a snap of her whip. Mud, stones, and ice seem to not be obstacles at all when Torohar is handling the team. She is a starry-eyed romantic at heart, and she can bring strong men to tears with her tales of long-ago lost loves and thwarted passion.": "安静、不张扬的威龙-托罗哈比贸易之路上的任何人都能更好地驾驭一队马或骡子。她有一种不可思议的诀窍，只需抽动一下缰绳，吹一声口哨，抽一下鞭子，就能让动物明白她想要什么。在托罗哈带队时，泥土、石头和冰块似乎根本不是障碍。她是一个内心充满星光的浪漫主义者，她可以用她的故事让强壮的男人流泪，讲述久违的爱情和受挫的激情。",
	"The stretch of road from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep is a journey of 750 miles. Horse-drawn or mule-drawn freight wagons cover 15 miles per day, depending on conditions. The animals need one day off after every six days of hauling to recover from their work. All things considered, the trip is expected to take two months.": "从博德之门（Baldur's Gate）到沃特德普（Waterdeep）这段路有750英里的路程。马拉或骡拉的货运马车每天行驶15英里，这取决于条件。牲畜在每六天的运输之后需要休息一天，以恢复它们的工作。综合考虑，这次旅行预计需要两个月时间。",
	"The caravan leaving Baldur's Gate contains the three wagons of the Cult of the Dragon plus {@dice 2d4} more. Not all travelers are merchants. A wagon might carry a family relocating to the north or a diplomat on a mission to Waterdeep. People and wagons join the caravan along the way, and others leave according to the dictates of business and fortune. Some travelers ride horses, some walk beside the wagons, and some pay the merchants to ride aboard their wagons. On several occasions, characters notice the cult teamsters turning away passengers even though they have spare room on their wagons.": "离开博德之门的商队包含了神龙教的三辆马车以及{@dice 2d4}更多。并非所有的旅行者都是商人。一辆马车可能载着一个迁往北方的家庭，或者一个去水底世界执行任务的外交官。人们和马车沿途加入商队，而其他人则根据商业和财富的要求离开。有些旅行者骑着马，有些走在马车旁边，有些则付钱给商人，让他们骑上马车。有几次，人物注意到邪教团队成员拒绝乘客，尽管他们的马车上还有空位。",
	"Nothing identifies the cult's wagons as anything but typical merchants hauling northbound freight. They don't bunch up during the day or camp together at night. As far as anyone else knows, their only connection is that they're part of this caravan.": "没有任何东西可以证明邪教的马车是典型的商人，是在拖动北行的货物。他们白天不聚在一起，晚上也不在一起扎营。就其他人所知，他们唯一的联系是他们是这个商队的一部分。",
	"{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} and eight of her guards leave Baldur's Gate secretly ahead of the caravan and ride north at a fast clip. They are headed for Castle Naerytar in the Mere of Dead Men and won't be seen again until {@adventure chapter 6|HotDQ|6}. She leaves twelve {@creature Guard||guards} behind. One travels with each wagon, acting as a guard and assistant to the teamster. The other nine are cloaked as private travelers in two distinct groups, seeking company and protection in the caravan for their journey.": "{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}和她的八个卫兵秘密地在商队前面离开Baldur's Gate，快速向北骑行。他们要去死人谷的奈瑞塔城堡，直到{@adventure chapter 6|HotDQ|6}才会再见到他们。她留下了12个{@creature Guard||guards}。一人与每辆马车同行，充当守卫和车夫的助手。另外九个人则以私人旅行者的身份隐身在两个不同的团体中，在商队中寻求陪伴和保护，以完成他们的旅程。",
	"The wagons travel for about eight hours per day, with a few stops to feed and water the horses and mules. Many nights are spent camping along the road. Most small towns have roadside inns if travelers want more comfort, and walled hostelries catering to wagon caravans are spread a few days apart. Animals and travelers can rest comfortably at these walled compounds while wagons are safely locked inside. The map for {@adventure chapter 5|HotDQ|5} shows a structure that once served that purpose. It can be used as the model for a typical hostelry if needed.": "马车每天行驶约8个小时，有几次停下来给马匹和骡子喂食和饮水。许多夜晚是在沿路露营。如果旅行者想要更多的舒适，大多数小镇都有路边的旅馆，而为马车商队服务的有墙的旅店则相隔几天。动物和旅行者可以在这些有墙的院子里舒适地休息，而马车则安全地锁在里面。{@adventure chapter 5|HotDQ|5}的地图显示了一个曾经用于该目的的结构。如果需要的话，它可以作为一个典型的旅店的模型。",
	"The most difficult part of the journey is near the beginning. A few days' travel north of Baldur's Gate brings the caravan into a countryside known as the Fields of the Dead. The road twists and wanders through hills dotted with ancient battlefields, dolmens, and barrow mounds. Common wisdom holds that it's a very bad idea to light a fire on a hilltop at night in the Fields of the Dead, because the light attracts monsters from miles around. Crossing this territory takes several days, during which everyone will be edgy and on watch.": "旅程中最困难的部分是接近开始的时候。在博德之门以北的几天行程中，商队进入了一个被称为 \"死亡之域 \"的乡间。道路曲折蜿蜒，穿过点缀着古战场、石墓和荒冢的山丘。一般认为，晚上在死亡之域的山顶上点火是一个非常糟糕的主意，因为灯光会吸引周围数英里的怪物。穿越这片领土需要几天时间，在此期间，每个人都会感到紧张和警惕。",
	"The journey north lasts about forty days, and most travelers hope these days are monotonous and uneventful. This being Faerûn, that's never the case.": "北上的旅程大约持续四十天，大多数旅行者都希望这些日子是单调而不平凡的。这里是法鲁恩，情况绝非如此。",
	"Many days pass with no excitement, but others see monster attacks, strange incidents, excitement at roadside stops, meetings with NPCs, and the ever-present question of where the cult's wagons are headed. You can pace these events however you like. Use a few, use them all, or make up more of your own.": "许多天过去了，没有任何激动人心的事情发生，但也有一些日子看到了怪物袭击、奇怪的事件、路边站的兴奋、与NPC的会面，以及始终存在的问题：邪教的马车要去哪里。你可以随心所欲地安排这些事件。你可以使用几个，也可以全部使用，或者自己编造更多的事件。",
	"On a trip of this length, checking for random events every hour is excessive. The Trade Way sees a lot of travelers and it is relatively (if not entirely) safe. Check for a random event each day by rolling a {@dice d20}. On a roll of 16 or higher, one or more events occur as indicated below:": "在这么长的旅程中，每小时检查一次随机事件是过分的。贸易之路有很多旅行者，而且相对（如果不是完全）安全。每天通过滚动{@dice d20}来检查一个随机事件。如果掷出16或更高的分数，就会发生一个或多个事件，如下所示。",

	"Another group of adventurers joins the caravan or is staying at the same roadside inn. Judging by their boasting, they have bested some of the most ferocious monsters and foes Faerûn has to offer. They look prosperous, they're filled with exciting tales, and they strike up a bond with a merchant who employs one or more of the characters. The next morning, that merchant informs the characters that their services are no longer needed because he has hired more experienced guards.": "另一队冒险者加入了商队，或者住在同一家路边旅馆。从他们的吹嘘来看，他们已经战胜了法鲁恩所能提供的一些最凶猛的怪物和敌人。他们看起来很富裕，充满了令人兴奋的故事，他们与雇佣了一个或多个人物的商人建立了联系。第二天早上，那个商人通知这些人物不再需要他们的服务了，因为他已经雇佣了更有经验的卫兵。",
	"One of the cult wagons overturns on a difficult corner or when a wheel breaks on a rock. Of the crates that tumble free, one smashes open, revealing dozens of beautiful items of jewelry wrapped in wool for protection. This is an excellent opportunity for the characters to see some of the contraband and even to get friendly with the cultists by helping them repair their wagon.": "其中一辆邪教马车在一个困难的转角处翻倒，或者当一个车轮在岩石上断裂时。在翻出的箱子中，有一个箱子被砸开了，露出了几十件用羊毛包裹着的美丽的珠宝。这是一个很好的机会，人物可以看到一些违禁品，甚至可以通过帮助他们修理马车而与邪教分子交好。",
	"Someone in the caravan develops a fancy for a treasured possession that belongs to one of the characters. The NPC tries to buy it, but the offered price is low. The NPC persists through the day, becoming more obnoxious without getting any more generous. Unless the character takes special precautions, the object disappears overnight. If the character accuses the NPC publicly the following morning, they make an enduring enemy; that NPC doesn't have the item and is incensed at the accusation. Someone else who witnessed the conversations the day before decided the other NPC provided perfect cover for a little nighttime thievery and took the missing item. To find the item, characters need to surreptitiously search people's bags and wagons, since few people will agree to have their belongings rifled through as if they were common thieves—especially not a common thief.": "商队中有人看上了属于某个角色的珍贵物品。这个NPC试图买下它，但出价很低。这名NPC坚持了一整天，变得更加令人讨厌，但却没有变得更加慷慨。除非角色采取特殊的预防措施，否则该物品会在一夜之间消失。如果这个角色在第二天早上公开指责这个NPC，他们就会成为一个持久的敌人；这个NPC没有这个物品，并且对这个指责感到愤怒。前一天目睹了这些对话的其他人认为另一个NPC为夜间偷窃提供了完美的掩护，并拿走了丢失的物品。为了找到物品，人物需要偷偷地搜查人们的袋子和马车，因为很少有人会同意把他们的物品当作普通的小偷来翻阅，尤其是普通的小偷。",
	"The merchants are terrified of the things and refuse to drive through them, fearing that they may be poisonous or worse. Besides that, the sounds spook the animals and make them impossible to control.": "商人们对这些东西感到恐惧，拒绝开车通过它们，担心它们可能有毒或更糟糕。除此之外，这些声音还惊动了动物，使它们无法控制。",
	"The mushrooms are growing so fast on the rain-soaked ground that a person can almost see them getting bigger. They were the size of champagne corks when first noticed; within an hour, they grow six inches tall, and a foot tall an hour later. Their growth slows down after that, but by then, most people in the caravan are certain that all is doomed.": "蘑菇在被雨水浸泡的地面上生长得非常快，人们几乎可以看到它们在变大。第一次注意到它们时，它们只有香槟酒瓶大小；一小时内，它们长到六英寸高，一小时后长到一英尺高。此后，它们的生长速度放缓，但到那时，大篷车里的大多数人都确信一切都注定了。",
	"People can clear a path through the mushrooms with six man-hours of work (six people could do it in one hour, or three people could do it in two hours).": "人们可以用六个工时的工作在蘑菇中清理出一条道路（六个人可以在一小时内完成，或者三个人可以在两小时内完成）。",

	"The stag can be cornered, fought, and killed. It is a normal stag but with a breathtakingly beautiful coat of golden fur. If the local farmers learn that it's been killed, they grab their pitchforks and longbows and threaten to overrun the caravan unless they are paid 500 gp for their loss; the stag brought them luck.": "雄鹿可以被逼到墙角，与之搏斗，并被杀死。它是一只普通的雄鹿，但却有着漂亮得令人窒息的金色皮毛。如果当地的农民知道它被杀了，他们会拿起干草叉和长弓，威胁要攻占商队，除非他们得到500金币的损失赔偿；雄鹿给他们带来了好运。",
	"The stag greets the characters in Sylvan. If none of the characters speak that language, it switches to Elvish, and if no one responds again, it tries heavily accented, pidgin Common. It assures them that they are on the right track, and they must continue following the river of gold until they reach the castle in the sky. Sadly, their path will be filled with hardship and blood. To aid them, it offers the character a +1 longbow. The bow appears on the ground before them, and then the stag fades from view saying, \"Not all will survive...\"": "雄鹿用西尔凡语向人物打招呼。如果没有人说这种语言，它就换成精灵语，如果再没有人回应，它就试着用口音很重的普通话。它向他们保证，他们在正确的轨道上，他们必须继续沿着黄金之河前进，直到他们到达天空中的城堡。不幸的是，他们的道路将充满艰辛和血腥。为了帮助他们，它为角色提供了一把+1的长弓。弓出现在他们面前的地面上，然后雄鹿从视野中消失，说：\"不是所有人都能活下来......\"",
	"As the caravan rounds a bend in the road, a human head can be seen sitting in the middle of the road a hundred yards ahead. From a distance, characters with a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 15 or higher recognize that the head is actually a person buried up to the neck, and he is {@condition unconscious} but still alive. That fact is obvious to anyone who approaches within 10 yards, as is the word \"Oathbreaker\" painted on his forehead.": "当商队绕过一个弯道时，可以看到一个人头坐在前面一百码的路中间。从远处看，被动智慧（{@skill Perception}）得分在15分以上的人物可以认出，这个头颅实际上是一个被埋到脖子的人，他是{@condition unconscious}但仍然活着。这个事实对任何接近10码以内的人来说都是显而易见的，就像他额头上画着的 \"Oathbreaker \"字样。",
	"Many of the merchants in the caravan are of the opinion that whoever this is, if someone or something went to the trouble of marking him as a traitor and burying him up to the neck in the Trade Way, he probably deserves it and should be left there. If characters are working as guards for NPC merchants, at least one of their employers is among this group. It's obvious from wheel tracks on the turned-over earth that other wagons have indeed passed him by during the last few days.": "商队中的许多商人都认为，不管他是谁，如果有人或东西费尽心思把他标记为叛徒并把他埋在贸易路上，那么他可能是活该，应该被留在那里。如果人物是为NPC商人工作的守卫，那么他们的雇主中至少有一个是在这群人中。从翻过的土地上的车轮痕迹可以看出，在过去的几天里，确实有其他马车从他身边经过。",
	"Digging the man out of the ground takes two diggers at least two hours, and refilling the hole takes another hour (you can't just leave a hole in the road).": "把人从地下挖出来，需要两台挖土机至少两个小时，再把洞重新填上，又需要一个小时（你不能在路上留下一个洞）。",
	"Publicly, Amoffel's story is that the oath he broke was a promise to marry a woman. He broke the engagement because he discovered that her father and brothers were all bandits and that he was expected to join them.": "公开资料显示，阿莫菲尔的故事是，他违背的誓言是与一个女人结婚的承诺。他打破了婚约，因为他发现她的父亲和兄弟都是强盗，而且他被期望加入他们。",
	"If any of the characters are Harpers and they reveal their association to Amoffel, he tells them the real story. He was on exactly the same mission they are: tracking a shipment of stolen loot north. But the smugglers—he's sure they're members of the Cult of the Dragon—became suspicious of him. Amoffel passed information to another Harper at a roadside inn, and members of the caravan witnessed the meeting. The cultists manufactured a story that he was passing information to bandits. The merchants were unwilling to kill him outright, but they were willing to leave him buried in the road and \"let providence decide the man's fate.\"": "如果任何一个角色是哈珀人，他们向阿莫菲尔透露了他们的关系，他就会告诉他们真实的情况。他的任务和他们一模一样：追踪一批被盗战利品的北上。但是那些走私者--他确信他们是 \"龙之教 \"的成员--对他产生了怀疑。Amoffel将信息传递给路边旅馆的另一个哈珀，商队成员目睹了这次会面。邪教分子制造了一个故事，说他在向土匪传递信息。商人们不愿意直接杀死他，但他们愿意把他埋在路上，\"让天意决定这个人的命运\"。",

	"After a miserably wet, cold day that promises to become an even wetter, freezing night, the caravan arrives at a large inn. Upon entering the warm, comfortable common room to make arrangements for the night, the embarrassed innkeeper tells the characters that the entire inn is sold out; all the private rooms are taken and the common room is reserved for a private party. The caravan will need to spend the night outside. Looking around the room, the characters see just one group: an aristocratic judge and his entourage of three human dilettantes. They smirk at the characters while making comments such as \"sleep tight\" and \"have a pleasant evening\" followed by insults muttered under their breath about the characters' mud-spattered clothing and low breeding. If characters ask about sleeping in the stable, one of the nobles speaks up, saying, \"Our horses are rather picky about who they share space with. We had to reserve all of it, too, for their sake. You understand, I'm sure.\" His snooty friends have a good chuckle over that.": "在经历了悲惨的湿冷的一天后，商队来到了一家大旅店。在进入温暖舒适的休息室安排晚上的住宿时，尴尬的旅店老板告诉人物，整个旅店的房间都卖光了；所有的私人房间都被占用了，而休息室则被保留给一个私人聚会。商队将需要在外面过夜。环顾房间，人物只看到一个团体：一个贵族法官和他的随从，三个人类的二流子。他们一边对人物傻笑，一边说 \"睡个好觉 \"和 \"祝你有个愉快的夜晚\"，然后口中喃喃自语，说人物的衣服沾满泥土，教养很差。如果人物问起睡在马厩里的事，其中一个贵族会说：\"我们的马对与谁分享空间相当挑剔。为了它们，我们也不得不保留所有的空间。你能理解，我相信。\" 他的那些冷眼旁观的朋友们为此发出了一阵阵的笑声。",
	"Spending this night in the wagons will be hard on the characters but will be misery for the unprotected horses and mules, and the only reason for it is the cruelty and arrogance of these snickering twits in the inn.": "在马车上度过这个夜晚，对人物来说是艰难的，但对没有保护的马匹和骡子来说却是痛苦的，而唯一的原因是旅店里这些窃笑的笨蛋的残忍和傲慢。",
	"The NPCs in the inn won't be influenced by any sort of reason or debate or by offers of money. They find the situation enormously amusing and seem pleased by the prospect of the merchants and their animals suffering in the freezing rain all night. They needle and goad the characters and their fellow travelers at every opportunity, including from the doorway and windows of the inn when no one else is inside. If the characters don't start a fight, someone else from the caravan might.": "旅店里的NPC不会被任何理由、辩论或金钱的提议所影响。他们认为这种情况非常有趣，而且似乎对商人和他们的动物整夜在冰冷的雨中受苦的前景感到高兴。他们一有机会就对主人公和他们的同伴针锋相对，包括在客栈的门口和窗口，当里面没有人的时候。如果这些人物不打起来，商队里的其他人可能会打起来。",

	"If the characters spent much time wandering through the raiders' camp on the Greenfields and talking to cultists, they might have struck up a conversation there with a cultist who is now one of the wagon drivers. Have each character make a Charisma check on the first day of the journey, but don't tell players what it's for. At some point during the journey, the character who scored the lowest result on the Charisma check is recognized by a cultist. The cultists assume that, at best, the character must be a deserter from the cult. At worst, he or she is a spy and a saboteur. At a dramatic point on the journey, when the caravan is away from Baldur's Gate, this means trouble.": "如果角色们花了很多时间在绿地上的突袭者营地徘徊，并与邪教分子交谈，他们可能会在那里与现在是马车司机之一的邪教分子交谈。让每个角色在旅程的第一天做一个魅力检查，但不要告诉玩家这是为了什么。在旅途中的某个时刻，在魅力检查中得分最低的角色被一个邪教分子认出。邪教分子认为，最好的情况是，这个角色一定是邪教的逃兵。最糟糕的是，他或她是一个间谍和破坏者。在旅途中的一个戏剧性时刻，当商队离开博德之门时，这意味着麻烦。",

	"If a character is recognized, allow that character to make a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check. Success means the character catches a cultist watching him or her suspiciously, noting who the character talks to, when the character eats, and where the character sleeps. Over the course of a few days, it should become obvious that this cultist has recognized the character. If characters delay taking action, the cultists strike first by trying to assassinate the characters in their bedrolls or perhaps by arranging an accident—a loose wheel, broken axle, or spooked lead horse might be an effective way to solve a problem. The only permanent solution to this problem for the characters is murder; the cultist with suspicions must be eliminated before he or she shares those suspicions with the others. Good characters may be reluctant to take this step; that's roleplaying. If they can find another way, that's excellent, but once the opposition recognizes someone, the situation is likely to end in death.": "如果一个角色被认出，允许该角色进行DC15智慧（{@skill Insight}）检查。成功意味着该角色抓到了一个邪教徒在怀疑地看着他或她，注意到该角色与谁交谈，什么时候吃饭，以及在哪里睡觉。在几天的时间里，应该可以明显看出这个邪教徒已经认出了这个角色。如果角色迟迟不采取行动，邪教分子就会先下手为强，试图暗杀躺在床铺上的角色，或者也许会安排一场意外--松动的车轮、断裂的车轴或受惊的铅马可能是解决问题的有效方法。对人物来说，解决这个问题的唯一永久办法是谋杀；必须在有怀疑的邪教分子与其他人分享这些怀疑之前将其消灭掉。好的角色可能不愿意采取这个步骤；这就是角色扮演。如果他们能找到其他的方法，那是极好的，但一旦反对派认出了某人，情况很可能以死亡告终。",

	"By this point in the journey, the characters should be popular with the other travelers; they probably have saved numerous lives and the entire caravan more than once.

Characters can't waste much time closing accounts with their own employers or sightseeing in Waterdeep, however, or they lose the treasure wagons in the crowded metropolis.": "当商队在路上行驶了两个月后驶入沃特迪普时，大部分的商人都分散到了城市的市场、仓库和马厩。他们已经到达了目的地，这些人物得到了银币的报酬，并感谢他们的服务。如果他们表现良好，他们被告知可以在未来任何时候在这些货主那里找到工作。然而，角色们不能浪费太多的时间与自己的雇主结账或在沃特德普观光，否则他们就会在这个拥挤的大都市中失去宝藏马车。",
	"The cult wagons don't follow the same pattern as the others from the caravan. Instead, they head for the north side of the city before looking for a place to spend the night. Everyone who the characters know to be associated with the cult gathers at the same spot by nightfall. {@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ} remains with the cultists during this time, and Jamna expresses her desire to stick with them until they uncover the treasure's destination.": "邪教的马车并不像商队中的其他人那样遵循同样的模式。相反，他们在寻找过夜的地方之前，先去了城市的北面。在夜幕降临前，所有人物知道的与邪教有关的人都聚集在同一地点。在这段时间里，{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}仍然和邪教分子在一起，贾姆娜表示她希望和他们在一起，直到他们发现宝藏的目的地。",
	"The cultists spend a day resting their horses at a stable on the north side of Waterdeep. Other wagons are already there, covertly carrying treasure from all over the Sword Coast to the collection point. During the day, some of the cultists visit a large warehouse just inside the northern city gate, where construction supplies are stockpiled for shipment north and where wagons are gathered and loaded for the trip.": "崇拜者们在沃特德普北侧的一个马厩里花了一天时间休息马匹。其他马车已经在那里了，暗中把来自剑海岸各地的财宝运到收集点。白天，一些邪教徒去了北面城门内的一个大仓库，那里囤积着准备向北运送的建筑用品，马车也在那里集结并装车准备出行。",
	"If characters ask around Waterdeep's northern gate about anyone matching {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}'s description, they hear rumors of a half-dragon being sighted in the area at least a tenday ago. Everyone remembers the incident; chromatic half-dragons are almost never seen, and they tend to cause alarm when they are. If the rumor is true, then the half-dragon was traveling with a strong escort of mounted guards, headed north. The rumor is true, of course, but it can't be confirmed 100 percent.": "如果人物在沃特德普的北门附近询问符合{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}描述的人，他们会听到关于至少在一天前在该地区看到一条半龙的传闻。每个人都记得这件事；半龙人几乎从未见过，而且他们一旦出现就会引起恐慌。如果传言属实，那么这条半龙是在强大的骑兵护卫下，向北行驶的。当然，这个传言是真的，但不能百分之百确认。",
	"By asking around, characters learn that the road to the north, called the High Road, used to connect Waterdeep to the city of Neverwinter. A cold, coastal marsh called the Mere of Dead Men lay between the road and the coast. Over the years, the mere continually expanded. Each time it grew, it flooded the road, which had to be relocated farther inland. That was the situation until a century ago, when Neverwinter was nearly destroyed by the eruption of Mount Hotenow. With the city in ruins, efforts to keep the road open simply stopped. It no longer served a purpose.": "通过打听，人物了解到北边的道路被称为 \"高路\"，曾经连接沃特德普和永冬城。在道路和海岸之间有一片寒冷的沿海沼泽，叫做 \"死人之丘\"。多年来，这个沼泽不断地扩大。每次它的增长都会淹没公路，公路不得不迁往更远的内陆。这种情况一直持续到一个世纪前，当时永夜城几乎被霍特诺山的喷发所摧毁。随着城市成为废墟，保持道路畅通的努力也随之停止。它不再有任何作用了。",
	"But now, Lord Neverember is rebuilding Neverwinter and the road is needed again. The warehouse visited by the cultists is where shipments of supplies to the road-building camps are coordinated. If freight haulers went there, it must have been to see if they could haul supplies to the road-head for pay. Are they hiring guards for supply caravans? Sure, you bet they are. The Mere of Dead Men is wild and dangerous. Lord Neverember's agents in this endeavor are perpetually looking for laborers to build the road and fighters to protect the laborers. Turnover in those jobs is pretty high.": "但现在，永夜城主正在重建永夜城，又需要这条路了。邪教分子访问的仓库是协调向筑路营地运送物资的地方。如果货运商去了那里，一定是想看看他们是否能把物资拉到路头来换取报酬。他们在为补给品商队雇用警卫吗？当然，你打赌他们是。死人谷是狂野而危险的。纽伦堡勋爵在这方面的代理人一直在寻找修路的工人和保护工人的战士。这些工作的流失率是相当高的。",
	"The cultists are not happy to see the characters again, so the characters are the target of dirty looks.": "邪教分子不高兴再看到这些角色，所以这些角色成为了肮脏的目光的目标。",
	"The work camp the convoy is headed toward lies 200 miles up the coast. For most of that distance, the road winds through rough coastal hills nestled between the Sword Mountains and the sea. On the seventh night, the convoy camps on a hilltop from which characters have their first sight of the Mere of Dead Men. It is a chill tangle of trees, brush, boggy ground, standing water, reeds, and cat-tails stretching farther than the eye can see. The rest of the trip is within sight of the mere. The destination is reached sometime on the tenth day.": "车队要去的工作营地位于海岸线上200英里处。在这段距离的大部分时间里，道路蜿蜒穿过依偎在剑山和大海之间的粗糙的沿海山丘。第七天晚上，车队在一个山顶上扎营，从那里，人们第一次看到了死亡之谷。这是一个由树木、灌木、沼泽地、积水、芦苇和猫尾草组成的寒冷的纠结体，延伸到了人们视线所及的范围。其余的行程都在视线范围内。目的地在第十天的某个时候到达。",
	"Nothing much needs to happen on the trip north of Waterdeep. You can narrate through it quickly. At your option, use the random encounters below to spice up the journey.

	"The convoy's destination is the Carnath Roadhouse, a compound that served as a hostelry on the trade road between Waterdeep and Neverwinter in the days when trade flourished. It fell into disuse when trade stopped, but now that the road is being rebuilt, the roadhouse has been repaired and put to use as a supply depot and wagon park. This part of the adventure plays like a spy story. Stealthy characters should find plenty to do here.": "车队的目的地是卡纳斯路屋，在贸易繁荣的年代，它是沃特迪普和永冬之间贸易道路上的一个旅馆。当贸易停止时，它就被废弃了，但现在道路正在重建，路屋被修复并被用作补给站和马车停车场。这一部分的冒险就像一个间谍故事。隐秘的人物应该在这里找到很多事情做。",
	"The work camp is exactly what it appears to be: a supply depot for the road builders. It is also something more, however: a transit point for the cult's contraband coming up from the south.": "这个工作营地正是它所表现出来的：筑路工人的供应站。然而，它也是更重要的东西：从南方运来的邪教违禁品的转运点。",
	"Most of the time, this open courtyard is crowded with crates, barrels, and stacks of supplies. The damp climate means that the ground is muddy, except when the temperature is below freezing. Then the mud hardens into uneven, frost-covered ruts. A path is kept clear from the gate to the stables so animals can be moved, but during busy times, that path often runs under the balcony in front of the doors to the rooms.": "大多数时候，这个开放的院子里挤满了板条箱、木桶和成堆的物资。潮湿的气候意味着地面是泥泞的，除非温度低于冰点。然后，泥浆会硬化成不平整的、覆盖着霜的车辙。从大门到马厩有一条小路保持畅通，以便动物能够被移动，但在繁忙的时候，这条小路经常从房间门前的阳台下穿过。",
	"In some ways, the stables are the most comfortable area of the compound. When the stables are crowded, the horses' and mules' body heat keeps the building warm. Four stable boys take care of the animals and sleep here. Only the youngest, a quick-witted boy called Wump, has any suspicion that something mysterious is going on. He knows nothing about the Cult of the Dragon, but he's sharp enough to wonder why anything used by the road builders needs to be locked up.": "在某些方面，马厩是大院里最舒适的地方。当马厩拥挤时，马匹和骡子的体温使建筑物保持温暖。四个马厩男孩负责照顾动物，并在这里睡觉。只有最年轻的，一个叫Wump的机灵男孩，对发生的神秘事情有所怀疑。他对神龙教一无所知，但他足够敏锐，想知道为什么筑路工人使用的任何东西都需要被锁起来。",
	"The warehouse door is latched but unlocked. Supplies that shouldn't be left exposed to the weather are stored here: food for the people and fodder for animals.": "仓库的门是锁着的，但没有上锁。不应该暴露在天气下的物资都存放在这里：人们的食物和动物的饲料。",
	"Unusually valuable cargoes and personal items are kept in the strong room under lock and key. None of the workers know or care what sorts of road-building supplies are considered so valuable they must be locked up for protection. They just follow Bog Luck's instructions and stack things where they're told to stack them.": "异常珍贵的货物和个人物品被锁在坚固的房间里。没有一个工人知道或关心什么样的筑路物资被认为是非常有价值的，必须被锁起来保护。他们只是听从博格-勒克的指示，把东西堆放在他们被要求堆放的地方。",
	"The key for this room is always on Bog Luck's belt, but the lock can be opened with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check and a set of {@item thieves' tools|PHB}.": "这个房间的钥匙一直在博格-勒克的腰带上，但只要成功地进行DC 10灵巧检查和一套{@item thieves' tools|PHB}，就可以打开锁。",
	"The wagon drivers, escorts, and laborers who stay at the compound share the rooms. None are private rooms; all have bunks for at least four people, and the larger rooms sleep six. They contain bunks, trunks for belongings, and wooden floors covered with rushes.": "住在院子里的马车司机、护卫人员和劳工共用这些房间。没有一间是私人房间；所有的房间都有至少四个人的床铺，较大的房间可以睡六个人。房间里有床铺、放物品的箱子，以及铺着芦苇的木地板。",
	"None of the rooms have locks on their doors except Bog Luck's. If asked about locks, Bog Luck explains that they kept freezing in cold weather so people couldn't get into or out of their rooms. This excuse is credible; the upper room doors, in particular, often are coated with ice in the morning. In fact, Bog Luck removed the locks to strengthen his excuse for locking the strong room.": "除了博格-勒克的房间，其他房间的门都没有锁。如果被问及锁的问题，博格-勒克解释说，在寒冷的天气里，锁一直在结冰，所以人们无法进入或离开他们的房间。这个借口是可信的；尤其是上层房间的门，在早上经常被冰块覆盖。事实上，博格-勒克拆除了门锁，以加强他锁住强壮房间的借口。",
	"The commander of the hired guards has this small room to himself. There is nothing remarkable about it.": "雇来的卫兵指挥官自己有这个小房间。它没有什么了不起的地方。",
	"This upper room is used for preparing food on a large stove. In the evenings, this doubles as a common room where people gather to smoke, drink, swap stories, and keep warm. Eventually the cook, a grumpy human called Gristle Pete, kicks everyone out so he can unroll his mattress and blankets and get some sleep.": "这个上层房间是用来在一个大炉子上准备食物的。晚上，这里也是一个公共房间，人们聚集在一起抽烟、喝酒、交换故事，并保持温暖。最后，厨师，一个脾气暴躁的人类，名叫格里斯托-皮特（Gristle Pete），把所有人都赶了出去，这样他就可以铺开他的床垫和毯子，睡上一觉。",
	"If characters listen carefully to Gristle Pete's mutterings as he works around his kitchen, they'll hear him talking in circles to himself about how he \"... don't get no sleep from all the critters in the floors banging and knocking and hissing and whispering at all hours\" and so on. The noises he hears and mistakes for rats are the lizardfolk retrieving contraband from the strong room below. If questioned, he hears the noises every now and then, not every night. If pressed, he realizes that the sounds happen a few nights after a new load gets dropped off. Now ain't that some oddball rat behavior?": "如果人物在厨房周围工作时仔细聆听格里斯托-皮特的喃喃自语，他们会听到他自言自语地谈论他如何\"......被地板上的所有小动物敲打、敲打、嘶嘶作响和窃窃私语弄得无法入睡\"，等等。他听到的、被误认为是老鼠的声音是蜥蜴人从下面的坚固房间里取回违禁品。如果被询问，他偶尔会听到这些声音，而不是每天晚上。如果被追问，他意识到，这些声音是在新的货物被运走后的几个晚上发生的。这不是一些奇怪的老鼠行为吗？",
	"Characters have a few ways to collect clues about what's happening at the work camp. Jamna can help out with these tasks if none of the characters are up to it.": "角色们有几种方法来收集关于工作营发生的事情的线索。如果没有一个角色能够胜任，贾姆纳可以帮助完成这些任务。",
	"If they watch the wagons being unloaded, they'll notice Bog Luck directing laborers to carry the crates brought from the Greenfields into the warehouse. If they have a chance to see what's going on in the warehouse, they see that all the crates go into the strong room. If they don't look inside the warehouse while the wagons are unloaded but inspect the warehouse later, they won't find any of the crates; the only other place they could have gone is into the strong room.": "如果他们观看马车卸货，他们会注意到博格-勒克指挥工人把从绿地带来的板条箱运进仓库。如果他们有机会看到仓库里发生的事情，他们会看到所有的板条箱都进入了坚固的房间。如果他们在马车卸货的时候不看仓库里面，而是稍后检查仓库，他们就不会发现任何板条箱；它们唯一可能去的地方就是坚固的房间。",
	"Gristle Pete, who sleeps above the strong room, hears strange noises on certain nights. He mistakes those noises for rats, but they come from lizardfolk carrying contraband into the tunnel beneath the strong room.": "睡在坚固的房间上面的格里斯托-皮特（Gristle Pete）在某些晚上听到奇怪的声音。他误以为这些声音是老鼠，但它们是蜥蜴人携带违禁品进入坚固的房间下面的隧道。",
	"They can take the direct approach and inspect the strong room surreptitiously. This leads to a fight with lizardfolk if characters search the room in the dead of night. Getting in by picking the lock is the safest approach. Trying to lift the key from Bog Luck's belt can work, but it's risky. If he catches someone in the attempt, a beating is the best they can hope for. A smart character submits to this humiliation, because fighting back means that Bog Luck calls everyone else to help him punish the thief, and all the characters are ostracized from then on. Taking the beating means Bog Luck keeps the incident between the two of them.": "他们可以采取直接的方法，偷偷摸摸地检查强壮的房间。如果人物在夜深人静时搜查房间，这将导致与蜥蜴人的战斗。通过撬锁进入是最安全的方法。试图从博格-勒克的腰带上拔出钥匙也是可行的，但这是有风险的。如果他抓住了某人的企图，他们最好的希望就是挨打。聪明的人物会屈服于这种羞辱，因为反抗意味着Bog Luck会召集其他人来帮助他惩罚小偷，所有的人物都会从此被排斥在外。挨打意味着Bog Luck将事件保留在他们两个人之间。",
	"Characters can arrange to have a room next to the Cult of the Dragon teamsters and listen through the walls to the cultists' conversation. They can't make out entire conversations, but they do pick out the words \"strong room,\" \"tunnel,\" \"lizardfolk,\" and \"Bog Luck.\"": "角色可以安排在龙之教团队成员的旁边开一个房间，隔着墙听邪教分子的谈话。他们无法听出整个谈话内容，但他们确实能挑出 \"强壮的房间\"、\"隧道\"、\"蜥蜴人 \"和 \"沼泽地的运气 \"等词。",
	"Talking to other escorts and wagon drivers yields some interesting observations but no concrete leads. Most of the others who came along on the haul north of Waterdeep agree that there's something standoffish about the cultists (they don't use that word).": "与其他护送者和马车夫交谈，得到了一些有趣的观察，但没有具体的线索。在沃特德普以北的旅途中，其他大多数人都同意，这些邪教徒（他们不使用这个词）有些冷漠。",
	"Searching the cultists' two rooms turns up something a personal bag containing six polished gems and small, easily concealed items of jewelry, all together worth about 1,400 gp. The cultists have a thief among them: a half-elf named Larion Keenblade. If he can be identified and accosted away from the others, he might agree to help the characters in exchange for their help getting away.": "在邪教徒的两个房间里搜查，发现了一个私人包，里面有六颗打磨过的宝石和一些容易隐藏的小首饰，总共价值约1400金币。这些邪教分子中有一个小偷：一个叫拉里昂-基恩布莱德的半精灵。如果能认出他，并在远离其他人的地方与他搭讪，他可能会同意帮助这些人物，以换取他们的帮助。",
	"A friend of the cultist murdered by Jamna has nurtured a grudge against a character since that incident. Now that their load is safely delivered and the mission is complete, this cultist can seek vengeance for her slain friend.": "被贾姆纳杀害的邪教人员的一个朋友，自从那次事件后就对一个角色怀恨在心。现在，他们的货物已经安全送达，任务已经完成，这个邪教分子可以为她被杀的朋友复仇了。",

	"This stout, stone castle was the home of a half-elf wizard, but he abandoned it long ago when the swamp claimed the area. For a time, a group of astrologers called the Academy of Stargazers took over the structure, but they vanished mysteriously after a few years. No one knows what became of them. Before the group's destruction, the members modified the castle by building an observatory into the top floor of the keep. Some of their magical viewing equipment is still there.": "这座坚固的石头城堡曾是一个半精灵巫师的家，但他在很久以前就放弃了它，因为沼泽占据了这个地区。有一段时间，一群被称为观星者学院的占星师接管了这座建筑，但几年后他们神秘地消失了。没有人知道他们后来怎么样了。在这个团体被摧毁之前，成员们对城堡进行了改造，在堡垒的顶层建造了一个天文台。他们的一些神奇的观察设备还在那里。",
	"Now the Cult of the Dragon has moved people into Castle Naerytar and formed shaky alliances with nearby swamp dwellers, but the surrounding swampland is far from under anyone's control. The cult brought lizardfolk, bullywugs, and a pair of black dragons together in an unstable alliance, but the factions are riven by deep distrust that outsiders can exploit.": "现在，神龙教将人们迁入了奈瑞塔城堡，并与附近的沼泽居民结成了不稳定的联盟，但周围的沼泽地远不在任何人的控制之下。邪教将蜥蜴人、恶霸和一对黑龙聚集在一起，组成了一个不稳定的联盟，但各派别之间存在着深深的不信任，外人可以利用。",
	"After seven miles of progress, characters reach a campsite at the approximate halfway point on the trip between the work camp and Castle Naerytar.": "经过七英里的进展，人物到达了一个营地，位于工作营地和奈瑞塔城堡之间行程的大约一半处。",
	"It isn't much of a camp—just a clearing that's slightly drier than the muck you've been wading through—but four wicker lean-tos and a stone platform (for lighting a fire above the soggy ground) command attention in this wilderness. Three dugout canoes are drawn up near one of the lean-tos.": "这并不是什么营地--只是一块空地，比你涉足的泥土略微干燥--但在这片荒野上，四个柳条简易帐篷和一个石头平台（用于在潮湿的地面上点火）引起了人们的注意。三艘独木舟被拉到其中一个简易帐篷附近。",
	"A few dozen yards beyond the campsite in the direction you've been traveling, dry land ends. Other than moss-covered trees, fallen logs, and thick clumps of reeds, nothing rises above the still, black water.": "沿着你所行进的方向，在营地的几十码之外，旱地就结束了。除了布满青苔的树木、倒下的原木和厚厚的芦苇丛外，没有任何东西耸立在静止的黑水之上。",
	"Each canoe has three paddles and is large enough to hold five humans without much gear, or two or three with packs and other gear. Inside the lean-tos are a few baskets containing smoked fish (edible) along with some lizards and birds that have been smashed flat and dried in the sun (very unappetizing to humans but edible).": "每条独木舟有三个桨，大到可以容纳五个人，没有太多的装备，或者两三个人带着背包和其他装备。在简易帐篷内有几个篮子，里面装着熏鱼（可食用）以及一些蜥蜴和鸟类，它们已被砸扁并在阳光下晒干（对人类来说非常不可口，但可食用）。",
	"These lizardfolk won't negotiate or converse with characters. They've been told by the elf who commands operations at Castle Naerytar that strangers in the mere are to be killed or captured but never engaged in conversation. If they are captured and tied up, a successful DC 10 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) or DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check loosens their tongues. If the lizardfolk aren't tied up, characters have disadvantage on these rolls because the lizardfolk think them soft-hearted.": "这些蜥蜴人不会与角色进行谈判或交谈。在奈瑞塔城堡指挥行动的精灵告诉他们，在这里的陌生人要被杀死或俘虏，但决不能与之交谈。如果他们被俘虏并被捆绑起来，成功通过DC10魅力（{@skill Intimidation}）或DC15魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查，他们的舌头就会松开。如果蜥蜴人没有被绑起来，人物在这些检查中处于劣势，因为蜥蜴人认为他们心肠很软。",
	"Lizardfolk know that they're transporting treasure to the castle. The \"dragon kneelers\" take it into the castle, and the lizardfolk never see it again. They are paid in steel blades (they have no ability to manufacture with metal) and magic talismans. All the lizardfolk wear necklaces and bracelets made of bone, teeth, feathers, carved soft stone, and leather. On close inspection, characters see mixed in among these things traces of civilization: glass beads, coins, costume jewelry, tiny mirrors, and stamped copper and tin amulets of the sort that can be bought for a few pennies at any trinket shop or souvenir stand. None of it is magical.": "蜥蜴人知道他们在向城堡运送财宝。跪龙者 \"将宝物带入城堡，而蜥蜴人再也看不到它了。他们的报酬是钢刀（他们没有用金属制造的能力）和魔法符咒。所有蜥蜴人都戴着由骨头、牙齿、羽毛、雕刻的软石和皮革制成的项链和手镯。仔细观察，人物会发现这些东西中混杂着文明的痕迹：玻璃珠、硬币、服装首饰、小镜子，以及在任何饰品店或纪念品摊位上花几分钱就能买到的那种盖章的铜和锡护身符。这些东西都不具有魔力。",
	"During the questioning, have every character make a Charisma check. Whichever character scores highest makes a strong impression on a lizardfolk captive. This lizardfolk, whose name is Snapjaw, is unhappy about the situation in the mere, and he develops the notion that these strangers could be the key to driving out the cultists and to slaughtering their cruel bullywug allies. Snapjaw tries to communicate with the chosen character, but he doesn't want any of his comrades to know. He speaks enough pidgin Common to converse in simple terms, in case no one in the party speaks Draconic.": "在问话过程中，让每个角色都做一个魅力检查。哪个角色的分数最高，就会给一个被俘的蜥蜴人留下深刻的印象。这个蜥蜴人的名字叫Snapjaw，他对Mere的情况很不满意，他认为这些陌生人可能是赶走邪教分子和屠杀他们残忍的恶霸盟友的关键。Snapjaw试图与被选中的人物沟通，但他不想让他的任何同志知道。他能说足够多的普通话，以进行简单的交流，以防队伍中没有人说德拉科尼亚语。",
	"How Snapjaw goes about opening a dialog depends on the situation. If he's the only surviving lizardfolk or he's questioned out of earshot from the others, he can speak openly. If several lizardfolk are tied up and they're being questioned together, he could sprinkle words of Common into his Draconic replies, such as \"want to help\" and \"talk alone.\" If several lizardfolk are tied up and left alone for a few minutes, he could scratch a similar message into the ground. He might try provoking a character into a wrestling match or a duel (if your players are the type to take up such a challenge), and then whisper his message into the character's ear.": "骁勇将军如何展开对话取决于情况。如果他是唯一幸存的蜥蜴人，或者他被审问时不在其他人的耳边，他可以公开说话。如果几个蜥蜴人被绑起来，而且他们被一起审问，他可以在他的龙语回答中撒上一些普通话，比如 \"想帮忙 \"和 \"单独谈谈\"。如果几个蜥蜴人被绑起来并被单独留下几分钟，他可以在地上划出类似的信息。他可能会试着挑衅一个角色进行摔跤比赛或决斗（如果你的玩家是接受这种挑战的类型），然后在这个角色的耳边说他的信息。",
	"If characters don't mistreat Snapjaw and don't kill any more lizardfolk than they need to, he becomes a reliable ally for as long as they work against the cult and the bullywugs.

On an odd roll, that NPC refuses to cooperate under any circumstance.": "如果角色们不虐待Snapjaw，也不杀害更多的蜥蜴人，那么只要他们努力反对邪教和恶霸，他就会成为一个可靠的盟友。为其他被俘的蜥蜴人各掷一个骰子。如果是偶数，Snapjaw会说服那个蜥蜴人加入他的小叛乱。如果是奇数，这个NPC在任何情况下都拒绝合作。",

Over decades of abandonment, however, it filled with debris and attracted many unpleasant dwellers. Then {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} happened upon the castle on one of her trips into the mere to study and negotiate with the black dragon Voaraghamanthar. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} suspected the castle could become a useful stronghold for her, being located so conveniently close to the lair of a black dragon. She explored the structure, cleared the giant spiders out of the tower, and forged an alliance with the nearby tribe of bullywugs.": "占星家消失后，城堡再次陷入荒废状态。它是为了抵御寒冷的水环境而建造的，所以水的侵袭并没有破坏墙壁或淹没地牢。然而，在几十年的废弃过程中，它充满了碎片，吸引了许多不愉快的居住者。然后，{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}在一次她进入Mere研究并与黑龙Voaraghamanthar谈判的时候，偶然发现了这座城堡。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}怀疑这座城堡可以成为她的一个有用的据点，因为它离黑龙的巢穴很近，很方便。她探索了这个结构，把巨大的蜘蛛从塔里清理出来，并与附近的霸王龙部落建立了联盟。",
	"During that time, the half-dragon was still thinking of the castle simply as a fortified hideout. When she discovered the portal in the dungeon and learned that it connected to an abandoned lodge in the Graypeak Mountains, a new thought took shape. Lugging large amounts of treasure fifteen miles through the mere would not be easy, but if it cut 700 miles of wagon transport out of the picture, it would be worth the difficulty—especially if bullywugs and lizardfolk did all the hard work. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} laid claim to both structures, turned the Graypeak Mountain hunting lodge over to a trusted Cult of the Dragon associate (a half-elf named Talis who now despises {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}—see {@adventure chapter 7|HotDQ|7}), and set about making Castle Naerytar an essential hub in the cult's treasure-amassing activity in the North.": "在那段时间里，半龙人仍然认为城堡只是一个坚固的藏身之处。当她发现地牢里的传送门，并得知它与灰峰山的一个废弃小屋相连时，一个新的想法形成了。把大量的财宝拖到15英里以外的地方并不容易，但如果能减少700英里的马车运输，那就值得一试了--特别是如果恶霸和蜥蜴人做了所有的辛苦工作。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}宣称拥有这两座建筑，将灰峰山狩猎小屋交给一个值得信赖的龙之教成员（一个半精灵，名叫塔利斯，现在看不起{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}--见{@adventure chapter 7|HotDQ|7}），并着手将奈瑞塔城堡打造成该教在北方搜刮宝藏活动的重要枢纽。",
	"Through diplomacy and intimidation, and by leveraging the influence of Voaraghamanthar with the monstrous creatures of the mere, {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} created an uneasy alliance in the Mere of Dead Men and brought her vision into reality.": "通过外交和恐吓，并利用沃拉格汉姆萨的影响力与纯粹的畸形生物，{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}在死人谷建立了一个不稳定的联盟，并将她的愿景变为现实。",
	"Three power groups operate around Castle Naerytar: the Cult of the Dragon, a band of bullywugs, and a lizardfolk tribe. The black dragon Voaraghamanthar, along with its kobold and lizardfolk minions, could constitute a fourth group if it took an active hand in events, but for now it is biding its time to see how events develop.": "在奈瑞塔城堡周围有三个势力集团：龙的崇拜、一伙恶霸和一个蜥蜴人部落。黑龙Voaraghamanthar，以及它的哥布林和蜥蜴人爪牙，如果积极参与事件，可以构成第四个团体，但现在它正在等待时机，看事件如何发展。",
	"{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}'s three-way alliance is unstable. The cultists despise living in the swamp and have little respect for the bullywugs or lizardfolk; the leader of the bullywugs would like to seize Castle Naerytar for his own purposes; the bullywugs in general take every opportunity to push around the lizardfolk; and the lizardfolk chafe under the abuse of the bullywugs and wonder why Voaraghamanthar doesn't step in to protect them.": "{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}的三方联盟是不稳定的。邪教徒鄙视生活在沼泽地的人，对恶霸和蜥蜴人都不尊重；恶霸的首领想为自己的目的夺取Naerytar城堡；恶霸一般会利用一切机会逼迫蜥蜴人；而蜥蜴人对恶霸的虐待感到不满，想知道为什么Voaraghamanthar不出面保护他们。",
	"Although {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} is responsible for resurrecting Castle Naerytar and claiming it for the Cult of the Dragon (in name only; she considers it her personal property), an elf Wearer of Purple named {@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}) commands the castle for {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}. The half-dragon needs to show up occasionally to remind the bullywugs and lizardfolk that the Cult of the Dragon is really in charge, but Borngray runs the operation.": "虽然{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}负责复活奈瑞塔城堡，并将其归于神龙教（只是名义上的，她认为这是自己的个人财产），但一个名为{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}的紫色精灵穿戴者（见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}）为{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}指挥着这座城堡。这个半龙人需要偶尔出现，以提醒恶霸和蜥蜴人，龙之教才是真正的负责人，但博恩格雷负责运营。",
	"{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} is a member of the Eldreth Valuuthra, a group of elf supremacists dedicated to removing humanity from Faerûn. He longs for the age of great empires before humans claimed the continent. Being from Evermeet, he believes that his island home will be safely sheltered from the dragons' reign. Elves on the mainland will suffer, but that will be a small price to pay for the terror that will fall on humanity.": "{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}是Eldreth Valuuthra的成员，一个致力于将人类从Faerûn移除的精灵至上主义者团体。他渴望在人类占领大陆之前的大帝国时代。作为来自Evermeet的人，他相信他的岛屿家园将被安全地保护起来，免受龙的统治。大陆上的精灵将遭受苦难，但这对人类的恐怖来说，只是一个小小的代价。",
	"The elf idolizes {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} in all ways but one: he rues her decision to elevate the bullywugs in their alliance. In Borngray's opinion, the lizardfolk would be more useful, more reliable, and more appropriate allies than the repulsive bullywugs are. He cannot alter the arrangement without countering {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}'s orders, but Borngray has taken small steps to restore the lizardfolk's tribal pride, such as by trying to teach them metallurgy. His effort has met with little success.": "精灵在所有方面都崇拜{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}，只有一点：他为她在联盟中提升bullywugs的决定感到遗憾。在Borngray看来，蜥蜴人将是比令人厌恶的bullywugs更有用、更可靠、更合适的盟友。他不能在不违背{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}的命令的情况下改变这种安排，但Borngray已经采取了一些小措施来恢复蜥蜴人的部落自豪感，例如试图教他们冶金术。他的努力收效甚微。",
	"Borngray is loyal to the cult and yearns for Tiamat's return. He genuinely looks forward to the whole world lying helpless under the claws of dragons, both because that's where the world belongs, and because it will mean that his job at Castle Naerytar is finished. The second-best day of his life will be the day when Borngray can scrape the mud and stink of the Mere of Dead Men off his boots and return to someplace civilized. He has never mentioned his desire to leave to the bullywugs, whom he considers revolting necessities.": "Borngray对邪教很忠诚，渴望Tiamat的回归。他真正期待着整个世界无助地躺在龙的爪子下，一是因为那是世界的归宿，二是因为这将意味着他在奈瑞塔城堡的工作结束。他生命中第二美好的一天将是Borngray能够从他的靴子上刮掉死人谷的泥土和臭味，回到某个文明的地方。他从未向恶霸们提起过他想离开的愿望，他认为恶霸们是令人反感的必需品。",
	"The band of bullywugs serving the Cult of the Dragon follows the dictates of {@creature Pharblex Spattergoo|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}), a rare bullywug who has mastered shamanistic magic. His \"religion\" is a mishmash of confused tradition, borrowed mysticism, hallucinogenic intoxicants, and manufactured lore that serves more as a road to personal power for Pharblex than as a spiritual system for the bullywugs. Pharblex's spellcasting holds his followers together, and that makes him useful to {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}.": "为 \"龙之教 \"服务的一群恶霸遵循{@creature Pharblex Spattergoo|HotDQ}（见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}）的指令，他是一个罕见的掌握萨满教魔法的恶霸。他的 \"宗教 \"是由混乱的传统、借用的神秘主义、致幻的麻醉剂和制造的传说组成的混合体，对法布尔克斯来说，这更像是一条通往个人权力的道路，而不是恶霸的精神体系。法布尔克斯的法术使他的追随者团结在一起，这使他对{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}很有用。",
	"Pharblex hopes that when Tiamat returns, {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} will hand Castle Naerytar over to him, and he will rule the entire Mere of Dead Men from the castle. The only obstacle he sees between himself and his goal is the castle's current master, {@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}; the notion that someone might want to not live in a swamp has never entered Pharblex's narrow mind, and the bullywug seems deaf to Borngray's ironic and sarcastic jabs at the mere. When the time is right, Pharblex plans to remove the elf from the picture by any means necessary. It is unlikely that he would choose the middle of a battle against the characters, when he and Borngray are fighting side by side, to betray the elf—but it's not impossible. If it looks like the cult's operation at the castle is doomed, Pharblex is the sort of creature who will switch sides to save his slimy skin. The timing must be perfect, because he fears {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} more than he fears the characters. If, however, the characters have won the lizardfolk over to their side, slaughtered or driven off most of the bullywugs, overrun the castle, and are poised to kill Borngray and Pharblex in battle—Pharblex judges that the ideal time to forsake old allies and court new ones has arrived. He offers just about anything in exchange for the characters leaving him alive and in possession of Castle Naerytar (with or without the {@i farseer of Illusk} in operating condition).": "法尔布拉斯希望当提亚马特回来时，{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}会把奈瑞塔城堡交给他，而他将在城堡里统治整个死人之地。他认为自己和他的目标之间的唯一障碍是城堡的现任主人{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}；有人可能想不住在沼泽地的想法从未进入法尔布拉斯狭隘的头脑，而且这个恶霸似乎对博恩格雷讽刺和挖苦的嘲讽充耳不闻。当时机成熟时，法布尔克斯计划通过任何必要的手段将这个精灵从画面中移除。他不太可能选择在与人物的战斗中，在他和博恩格雷并肩作战的时候，背叛精灵--但这也不是不可能。如果看起来邪教在城堡的行动是注定要失败的，法布尔克斯是那种会转换阵营以拯救他的粘稠皮肤的生物。时机必须是完美的，因为他对{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}的恐惧比对角色的恐惧更甚。然而，如果角色们已经赢得了蜥蜴人的支持，屠杀或赶走了大部分的恶霸，占领了城堡，并准备在战斗中杀死博恩格雷和法布尔克斯--法布尔克斯判断，放弃旧盟友、争取新盟友的理想时机已经到来。他提供了几乎所有的东西，以换取角色们活着离开并拥有Naerytar城堡（无论是否有{@i farseer of Illusk}的运行状态）。",
	"The bullywugs already believe themselves to be lords of the mere, and they act like it. They are easily confused, however. Under normal circumstances, they attack adventurers on sight, provided the bullywugs had superior numbers. They have grown accustomed to seeing cultists of many races coming and going around the castle, so when they see strangers, their first assumption is that the newcomers are more cultists. This assumption is reinforced if Snapjaw or other lizardfolk accompany the strangers or if the characters have any overtly cultish gear or clothing.": "恃强凌弱的人已经认为自己是这片土地的主宰，他们的行为也是如此。然而，他们很容易被迷惑。在正常情况下，他们会当场攻击冒险者，只要恶霸虫的数量占优。他们已经习惯了看到许多种族的邪教徒在城堡周围来来往往，所以当他们看到陌生人时，他们的第一个假设是，新来的人更多是邪教徒。如果Snapjaw或其他蜥蜴人陪伴着这些陌生人，或者如果角色有任何明显的邪教装备或服装，这种假设就会得到加强。",
	"This doesn't mean characters can wander at will through the camp and the castle. Bullywug guards still challenge them to ask who they are and where they're going (in fractured pidgin Common if none of the characters speak Bullywug). They just don't assume that every stranger is an enemy and attack on sight.": "这并不意味着人物可以在营地和城堡中随意游荡。恶霸守卫仍然会向他们提出挑战，询问他们是谁，要去哪里（如果角色中没有人说恶霸语，就用断断续续的皮金语）。他们只是不认为每个陌生人都是敌人，不会见人就攻击。",
	"The Scaly Death lizardfolk tribe has no leader. Pharblex killed its shaman, Suncaller, and the death left the tribe with an inferiority complex that was ripe for exploitation. When {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} promised that Voaraghamanthar would reward the tribe's labors for the cult, the lizardfolk were ready to listen.": "鳞片死亡蜥蜴人部落没有领袖。法布尔克斯杀死了它的萨满，太阳召唤者，这次死亡给该部落留下了自卑感，而这种自卑感已经成熟，可以利用。当{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}承诺Voaraghamanthar将奖励该部落为邪教所做的劳动时，蜥蜴人准备听从。",
	"Where the bullywugs fill the role of a static defense force, the lizardfolk perform five functions. First, they are the cult's laborers and porters. Lizardfolk did most of the heavy work while clearing debris from the castle, and they carry most of the treasure from the work camp to the castle on their backs and in their canoes. Second, they tend the giant lizards that are used to drag or carry especially heavy loads through the mere. Third, they do most of the hunting, fishing, and gathering to feed everyone at the castle. Fourth, they act as the castle's far-ranging scouts and outlying guards, since they are far superior to any bullywug at actively patrolling, ambushing, and laying traps. Fifth, a cadre of lizardfolk has been enlisted as elite guards for the castle itself. Borngray doesn't expect that any force would ever mount a real attack against the castle; it's too inaccessible, lying deep in the swamp. But if that unlikely event ever happened, he knows that the swaggering bullywugs would desert rather than fight an organized enemy. The lizardfolk, on the other hand, can be courageous and disciplined when they have a leader worth following. Borngray hopes to be that leader, at least to the small contingent of lizardfolk warriors he houses in the castle and rewards with special treatment. In exchange for their work, Borngray \"pays\" the tribe in metal weapons that are brought to the castle along with the loot.": "蜥蜴人扮演着静态防御力量的角色，而蜥蜴人则扮演着五个角色。首先，他们是邪教的劳动者和搬运工。蜥蜴人在清理城堡中的碎片时做了大部分重活，他们用背和独木舟将大部分宝物从工作营地运到城堡中。第二，他们照看巨大的蜥蜴，这些蜥蜴被用来拖动或携带特别重的货物通过米勒。第三，他们做大部分的狩猎、捕鱼和采集，以养活城堡里的每个人。第四，他们充当城堡的远距离侦察兵和外围守卫，因为他们在积极巡逻、伏击和布置陷阱方面远胜于任何恶霸虫。第五，一队蜥蜴人被征召为城堡本身的精英警卫。博恩格雷并不指望任何力量会对城堡发动真正的攻击；它太难以接近了，深藏在沼泽中。但是，如果这种不可能发生的事情发生了，他知道那些大摇大摆的恶棍们会抛弃而不是与一个有组织的敌人作战。另一方面，当蜥蜴人有一个值得追随的领袖时，他们会变得勇敢而有纪律。博恩格雷希望成为这样的领袖，至少对他在城堡里安置的一小队蜥蜴人战士来说是这样，并给予特殊待遇。作为对他们工作的回报，博恩格雷用金属武器来 \"支付 \"这些部落，并将其与战利品一起带到城堡。",
	"Meanwhile, the bullywugs boss and bully the lizardfolk, emboldened by their superior numbers, the lizardfolk's instinctive awe of Pharblex's magic, and the absence of any restraining sign from Borngray or from the lair of the black dragon. Voaraghamanthar's silence, more than anything else, makes the lizardfolk wonder whether fate is punishing them for some unknown transgression. They grumble, and occasionally a few desert, but most of them bear up with reptilian stoicism.": "与此同时，恶霸们欺负蜥蜴人，因为他们人数众多，蜥蜴人对法布尔克斯的魔法有着本能的敬畏，而且博恩格雷和黑龙的巢穴都没有任何限制的迹象。沃拉格汉姆萨尔的沉默，比其他任何事情都更让蜥蜴人怀疑命运是否在惩罚他们某些未知的过失。他们怨声载道，偶尔会有几个人开小差，但他们中的大多数人都以爬行动物的坚忍不拔的精神忍受着。",
	"Snapjaw is one of the few who has suggested rebelling against the hated bullywugs and the cultists. He hasn't done so openly, because that would invite retribution from the bullywugs, but he has spoken to a few fellow tribesfolk he trusts. Their response was interested but noncommittal; they intend to take revenge on the bullywugs, but not until the omens are right. Meanwhile, they endure—and stockpile weapons. Borngray has only a rough idea of how many lizardfolk are in the tribe all together, and he hasn't kept close count over how many swords, spears, daggers, shields, and metal-tipped arrows have been turned over to them. The lizardfolk are much better armed at this point than they let on to either the bullywugs or the cultists. When the time comes to move against the bullywugs, the lizardfolk intend for every bullywug throat and belly to be slit open with a new, razor-sharp steel blade.": "骁勇是少数建议反抗可恨的恶霸和邪教徒的人之一。他没有公开这么做，因为那会招致恶霸的报复，但他已经和他信任的几个部落同胞谈过。他们的反应很感兴趣，但不置可否；他们打算向恶霸武者复仇，但要等到预兆正确时才能进行。与此同时，他们忍耐着--储存武器。Borngray对部落里有多少蜥蜴人只有一个粗略的概念，他也没有仔细数过有多少剑、长矛、匕首、盾牌和金属尖端的箭被移交给他们。在这一点上，蜥蜴人的武器要比他们对恶霸和邪教分子所说的好得多。当对付恶霸的时候，蜥蜴人打算用一把新的锋利的钢刀割开每个恶霸的喉咙和腹部。",
	"The Scaly Death tribe comprises eighty lizardfolk warriors, both male and female. About half of them are in the vicinity of the castle at any given time; twenty-six live in the castle and the rest in reed huts (area 3). The others are away hunting, fishing, patrolling, hauling contraband from the work camp, or visiting their families in the tribal village (a few hours away to the southwest).": "鳞片死亡部落由八十名蜥蜴人战士组成，有男有女。他们中大约有一半人在任何时候都在城堡附近；26人住在城堡里，其余的住在芦苇屋里（3号区域）。其他人则外出打猎、捕鱼、巡逻、从工作营地拖运违禁品，或到部落村落（西南方向几小时路程）探亲。",
	"Only one Red Wizard is present at Castle Naerytar: {@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}, who was also in the cult camp on the Greenfields and traveled north with {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}. He has no interest in the Mere of Dead Men, bullywugs, or lizardfolk, and just slightly more interest in black dragons. He is here only as {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}'s liaison to {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}. The portal beneath the castle piques Jos's interest, however; portals are always of concern to the Red Wizards.": "在奈瑞塔城堡只有一个红袍巫师。{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}，他也在绿原上的邪教营地，和{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}一起向北旅行。他对死人谷、恶霸、蜥蜴人没有兴趣，只是对黑龙稍有兴趣。他在这里只是作为{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}与{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}的联络人。然而，城堡下面的传送门引起了乔斯的兴趣；传送门总是受到红袍巫师的关注。",
	"Adventurers appearing at this remote, secret site also interest him. If {@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ} sees the characters or learns of their presence, he arranges a private meeting—one that {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} and Borngray don't even know about, let alone attend. He wants to learn how much the characters know of the cult's plans, where and how they uncovered the information, who else knows about it, and what they think of the plan's chance to succeed. If the characters are captured and locked up in the castle, Jos finds an opportunity to ask all the same questions, again privately, but he is in a better position to force answers out of the characters.": "在这个偏远的秘密地点出现的冒险者也让他感兴趣。如果{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}看到这些人物或得知他们的存在，他就会安排一次私人会面--{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}和Borngray甚至不知道，更不用说参加了。他想知道这些人物对邪教的计划了解多少，他们在哪里以及如何发现这些信息的，还有谁知道这些信息，以及他们对计划成功的可能性有何看法。如果人物被抓并被关在城堡里，乔斯就有机会再次私下问同样的问题，但他能更好地迫使人物回答。",
	"This assumes the characters are at Castle Naerytar posing as cultists or hiding among the lizardfolk. If they're rampaging through the castle, killing everyone they meet, then {@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ} has only one concern: escaping through the portal before someone or something kills him.": "这是假设人物在Naerytar城堡假扮成邪教徒或躲在蜥蜴人中。如果他们在城堡里横冲直撞，杀死他们遇到的每一个人，那么{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}只关心一个问题：在某人或某物杀死他之前从传送门逃出去。",
	"Voaraghamanthar is an adult black dragon who claims the Mere of Dead Men as his territory. Although many creatures live in the mere and dominate it to one extent or another, none challenge Voaraghamanthar's supremacy. The bullywugs consider him a constant threat and tremble whenever his shadow passes near. The yuan-ti grant him grudging respect and covet his immense wealth. The lizardfolk honor him and wonder why he allows the cultists to abuse them. The cultists venerate him and divert some of the arriving contraband to his lair as tribute.": "沃拉格曼瑟是一条成年黑龙，他声称死人谷是他的领土。虽然有许多生物生活在这个地方，并在某种程度上主宰着它，但没有人挑战沃拉格曼瑟的霸主地位。恶霸虫认为他是一个持续的威胁，每当他的影子经过附近时都会颤抖。元老们给予他勉强的尊重，并觊觎他巨大的财富。蜥蜴人尊敬他，并想知道为什么他允许邪教组织虐待他们。邪教徒们敬仰他，并将一些抵达的违禁品转移到他的巢穴作为贡品。",
	"{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} persuaded the twins to pledge their aid to the cult, but so far, the pledge hasn't carried much weight. Neither dragon leaves its lair frequently enough to provide much help. Like all black dragons, these two are paranoid about all other dragons. Tiamat's potential return and the establishment of a vast dragon empire seem like remote possibilities compared to the real danger of tangling with another dragon, any of whom would gladly murder Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor for their hoards. That's the twins' outlook, anyway. While their concern over the murderous nature of other dragons is justified, the fact that they are two means they have little to fear from most solitary dragons. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} is working hard to persuade them that they could gain great power by revealing their secret at the strategically correct moment. Until Tiamat's return looks more certain, however, Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor intend to keep playing it safe, stick close to home, and guard their secret.": "{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}说服了这对双胞胎承诺对邪教的援助，但到目前为止，这个承诺还没有多少分量。两条龙都没有经常离开自己的巢穴，无法提供什么帮助。像所有的黑龙一样，这两条龙对所有其他的龙都很偏执。与与其他龙纠缠在一起的真正危险相比，提亚马特的潜在回归和一个庞大的龙帝国的建立似乎是遥远的可能性，任何一个龙都会为了它们的囤积物而高兴地谋杀沃拉格曼瑟尔和瓦瓦兰多。无论如何，这就是这对双胞胎的观点。虽然他们对其他龙的凶残本性的担忧是有道理的，但他们是两个人的事实意味着他们对大多数孤独的龙没有什么可担心的。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}正在努力说服他们，只要在战略上正确的时刻揭开他们的秘密，他们就能获得巨大的力量。然而，在提亚马特的回归看起来更加确定之前，沃拉格汉姆塔尔和华尔瓦伦多打算继续稳扎稳打，贴近家庭，并保护他们的秘密。",
	"Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor are not a true faction in the mere because they are not advancing any agenda of their own, but their presence affects the balance of power.

	"Both dragons' lairs are heavily guarded by lizardfolk. The dragons' guards are selected from the Scaly Death lizardfolk that work for the cult. Kobolds infest the actual lairs, but they seldom come out into the mere.": "两条龙的巢穴都有蜥蜴人的严密守卫。龙的守卫是从为邪教工作的鳞片死亡蜥蜴人中挑选出来的。哥布林在实际的巢穴中出没，但他们很少到外面来。",

For purposes of this adventure, do everything you can to ensure that {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} and Jos survive this chapter. It's not a catastrophe if they don't, but it's much better if they do.": "{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}和{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}为了避免与干涉的冒险者发生战斗，几乎什么都做了。他们有比奈瑞塔城堡及其居民的安全更重要的考虑。如果发生战斗，这两个角色会直接前往城堡下面的大门，并传送到{@creature Talis the White|HotDQ}的狩猎小屋（见{@adventure chapter 7|HotDQ|7}）。为了这次冒险的目的，尽你所能确保{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}和乔斯在这一章中幸存下来。如果他们没能活下来，也不是什么大灾难，但如果他们能活下来，那就更好了。",
	"{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} and {@creature Pharblex Spattergoo|HotDQ} have everything to lose if enemies of the cult overrun Castle Naerytar; a defeat would cost Borngray his hard-earned rank in the cult, and Spattergoo would lose the base from which he hopes to rule the mere after the cult is finished with the castle. They fight to the death to protect the castle (simultaneously buying time for {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} and Jos to escape).

As soon as fighting breaks out, they join forces and cooperate.": "如果邪教的敌人攻占了Naerytar城堡，{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}和{@creature Pharblex Spattergoo|HotDQ}就会失去一切；失败会使Borngray失去他在邪教中来之不易的地位，而Spattergoo也会失去他希望在邪教结束对城堡的统治的基地。他们为了保护城堡而殊死搏斗（同时为{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}和乔斯逃跑争取时间）。尽管他们彼此厌恶，但他们明白，他们在一起比分开要强得多。一旦战斗爆发，他们就会联合起来，进行合作。",
	"The best place for Borngray and Pharblex to make their stand depends on how the attack develops; you'll need to play that part by ear. Their best ploy against a determined assault may be a fighting retreat through the castle and down into the caverns, where the narrow passages and giant frogs work in their favor.": "Borngray和Pharblex的最佳位置取决于攻击的发展情况；你需要听从这部分的安排。他们应对坚决进攻的最好策略可能是通过城堡战斗性地撤退到洞穴里，那里的狭窄通道和巨大的青蛙对他们有利。",
	"The bullywugs are numerous but cowardly. They fight to protect Pharblex, but if he isn't immediately in sight—if Pharblex has retreated into the caverns while other bullywugs are fighting in the inner ward, for example—bullywugs who feel as if he has abandoned them are likely to leap away into the mere and never come back. If Pharblex is killed, most bullywugs desert immediately.": "恶霸虫的数量很多，但却很胆小。他们为保护法布尔克斯而战，但如果他没有立即出现在眼前--例如，如果法布尔克斯撤退到洞穴中，而其他恶霸虫正在内区战斗--恶霸虫们觉得他已经抛弃了他们，就很可能跳到远处，再也不回来了。如果法布尔克斯被杀，大多数恶霸武者会立即开溜。",
	"The lizardfolk are brave, but they despise the bullywugs. If characters haven't recruited the lizardfolk to their side, then the lizardfolk fight well whenever they're alone. If bullywugs are nearby, lizardfolk pull back and let the bullywugs bear the brunt of combat and casualties. If the lizardfolk have been won over to fighting alongside the characters, then they hunt bullywugs through the castle and grounds and murder them mercilessly. If bullywugs flee into the swamp, lizardfolk chase them. They are half-hearted when facing cultists—not because they fear the cultists but because they don't hate them, and they have a harder time mentally turning against that alliance.": "蜥蜴人很勇敢，但他们鄙视恶霸。如果角色没有把蜥蜴人招募到自己身边，那么蜥蜴人只要单独作战就会打得很好。如果附近有恶霸，蜥蜴人就会撤退，让恶霸承担战斗和伤亡的主要责任。如果蜥蜴人已经赢得了与角色并肩作战的机会，那么他们就会在城堡和地面上猎杀恶霸，并毫不留情地杀害他们。如果恶霸逃入沼泽，蜥蜴人就会追赶它们。他们在面对邪教徒时半信半疑--不是因为他们害怕邪教徒，而是因为他们不恨邪教徒，而且他们在精神上更难反对这个联盟。",
	"The cultists are dedicated but not fanatics, and they are laborers, not soldiers. They fight bravely with {@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} leading them. Without him, the cultists' attacks are uncoordinated and hesitant. Their situation becomes even worse if they are fighting against rebellious lizardfolk. In that case, without Borngray to egg them on, they are most likely to barricade themselves in the upper levels of the southwest tower or the library and try to ride out the slaughter.": "邪教分子很敬业，但不是狂热者，他们是劳动者，不是士兵。他们在{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}的带领下勇敢地战斗。没有他，邪教分子的攻击是不协调的，而且犹豫不决。如果他们是在与反叛的蜥蜴人作战，他们的情况会变得更糟。在这种情况下，如果没有博恩格雷给他们打气，他们很可能会把自己关在西南塔的上层或图书馆里，试图度过这场屠杀。",
	"How characters approach Naerytar can set the tone for everything that happens at the castle.": "人物如何接近Naerytar可以为城堡里发生的一切定下基调。",
	"Snapjaw knows where the lizardfolk pickets are posted about half a mile out from the castle. If he is with the characters, he can prevent them from blundering into a trap or an ambush. He talks to the six {@creature lizardfolk} guards if characters let him. What he tells them depends on the opinion he's formed about the characters.": "骁勇知道蜥蜴人纠察队在离城堡大约半英里的地方驻扎。如果他和人物在一起，他可以防止他们误入陷阱或伏击。如果角色允许，他可以和六个{@creature lizardfolk}卫兵交谈。他告诉他们什么，取决于他对这些人物形成的看法。",
	"If Snapjaw isn't yet sure whether the characters are the saviors he hopes they are, he tells the guards that these are cultists coming to join those already in the castle. The guards accept that story without question and let everyone pass.": "如果Snapjaw还不确定这些人物是否是他希望的救世主，他就告诉守卫，这些人是来加入已经在城堡里的邪教徒的。守卫们毫无疑义地接受了这个说法，并让大家通过。",
	"If the heroes have established strong trust between themselves and Snapjaw, he tells the guards that the characters are great warriors come to destroy the Cult of the Dragon, and that now is the time to make their move against the bullywugs. You can either decide for yourself how the guards react to that, or make a DC 10 Charisma check for Snapjaw. If the check succeeds, the guards are persuaded. If the check fails, the characters don't impress them. They won't take action against the bullywugs now, but they won't interfere with the characters, either. If the result is 5 or lower, these guards decide Snapjaw's talk of an uprising is dangerously rash, and they attack him.": "如果英雄们已经在他们和Snapjaw之间建立了强大的信任，他就会告诉守卫们，这些角色是来摧毁龙之教的伟大战士，现在是对恶霸的行动的时候。你可以自己决定守卫们的反应，或者为Snapjaw做一个DC10魅力检查。如果检定成功，守卫们就会被说服。如果检定失败，人物就不会打动他们。他们现在不会对恶霸采取任何行动，但是他们也不会干涉这些角色。如果结果是5或更低，这些守卫认为Snapjaw关于起义的谈话是危险的轻率的，他们会攻击他。",
	"If the characters have done nothing to win Snapjaw's trust or they've treated him no better than bullywugs would have, then he tells the guards that the characters are nothing but trouble, and the lizardfolk attack.": "如果这些角色没有做任何事情来赢得Snapjaw的信任，或者他们对他的态度并不比bullywugs好，那么他就会告诉守卫，这些角色只是个麻烦，蜥蜴人就会发动攻击。",
	"If Snapjaw is not with the characters, they still have a chance to detect the guard outpost on their own. Characters with passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) scores of 15 or higher catch whiffs of wood smoke. Also make a single Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check for the lizardfolk guards, with advantage (they've had plenty of time to conceal themselves). Compare their result to the characters' passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) scores to see whether any of the characters notice the lizardfolk in hiding.": "如果Snapjaw不在角色身边，他们仍有机会独自探测到守卫的前哨。被动智慧（{@skill Perception}）得分在15分以上的角色可以捕捉到一缕木头烟的味道。同时对蜥蜴人守卫进行一次灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查，有优势（他们有足够的时间来隐藏自己）。将他们的结果与角色的被动智慧（{@skill Perception}）得分相比较，看看是否有角色注意到蜥蜴人的隐藏。",
	"If the lizardfolk go undetected, they send two fast swimmers ahead by a secondary route to alert bullywugs at the castle. Two more scouts follow the characters while the last two remain at their post and continue keeping watch.": "如果蜥蜴人没有被发现，他们会派两个快速游泳的人从第二条路线前进，提醒城堡里的恶霸。另有两名侦察员跟随这些人物，而最后两名侦察员则留在自己的岗位上继续监视。",
	"Castle Naerytar was built on dry land, then a deep, dry moat was dug around it. When the mere expanded and surrounded the castle site, the moat flooded and overflowed. Now the whole site is swampy, and large pools of standing water dot the clearing. The castle was built on exposed bedrock, so its foundation is sound and mostly dry even a century after the flooding. Tangled brush and trees grow to within twenty feet of the walls on three sides of the castle. Only the front (southern) face is clear.": "Naerytar城堡建在干燥的土地上，然后在其周围挖了一条深而干的护城河。当单纯的扩大并包围城堡所在地时，护城河被淹没并溢出。现在整个场地都是沼泽地，大片的积水点缀在空地上。城堡建在裸露的基岩上，所以它的地基是健全的，即使在洪水泛滥的一个世纪后，也大多是干燥的。缠结的灌木和树木生长在城堡三面墙壁的20英尺以内。只有正面（南面）是清楚的。",
	"Bullywugs live in crowded, hastily made reed huts. The lizardfolk have sturdier, roomier reed longhouses.": "恶霸住在拥挤的、匆忙制作的芦苇屋里。蜥蜴人有更结实、更宽敞的芦苇长屋。",
	"A half-dozen dugout canoes are pulled up onto land here. Three to five paddles lie in the bottom of each. Five of them are in good condition; the sixth has a rotten bottom, and the lizardfolk never use it. If characters grab canoes in a hurry, there is a 1-in-6 chance they get the rotten one. It starts leaking as soon as it's put in water, and it sinks after fifteen minutes.": "有半打独木舟被拉到这里的陆地上。每艘船的底部都有三到五个船桨。其中五个状况良好；第六个底部已经腐烂，蜥蜴人从不使用它。如果角色们匆匆忙忙地抓住独木舟，他们有六分之一的机会得到腐烂的那只。它一放进水里就开始漏水，15分钟后就会沉下去。",
	"The lizardfolk keep their giant lizards penned here. The five-foot-high wall of the stockade is made from sturdy logs driven into the earth, spaced about six inches apart, and bound together with twisted fiber. The lizards can carry or drag loads that are too massive for the lizardfolk, such as large timbers or impressive crocodiles. They are also used to raise stone onto the castle battlements through ropes and pulleys—technology that never ceases to amaze the lizardfolk. There are {@dice 2d4} {@creature Giant Lizard||giant lizards} in the pen at any given time. They are ill-tempered and attack anyone who comes within reach if their handlers aren't present to keep them under control. If set loose, they most likely romp away into the swamp. If the goal is to have the lizards rampage through the camp, someone needs to rile them up first. Poking them through the stockade wall with spears will do the trick.": "蜥蜴人把他们的巨型蜥蜴关在这里。五英尺高的栅栏墙是由坚固的原木打入土中制成的，间隔约六英寸，用扭曲的纤维捆绑在一起。蜥蜴可以搬运或拖动那些对蜥蜴人来说过于庞大的货物，如大木头或令人印象深刻的鳄鱼。它们还被用来通过绳索和滑轮将石头提升到城堡的垛口上，这种技术从未停止过对蜥蜴人的惊奇。在任何时候都有{@dice 2d4}{@creature Giant Lizard||giant lizards}在栏里。它们脾气不好，如果饲养员不在现场控制它们，它们会攻击任何近在咫尺的人。如果放任不管，它们很可能会在沼泽地里乱跑。如果目标是让蜥蜴在营地里横冲直撞，需要有人先把它们激怒。用长矛把它们刺穿栅栏墙就可以了。",
	"The lizardfolk warriors live in these longhouses.": "蜥蜴人战士住在这些长屋里。",
	"The longhouses are made from reeds bound into long, thick bundles and bent into upside-down, U-shaped ribs. The spaces between the ribs are latticed and thatched with more reeds. Each longhouse has a single, woven door in the center of one end wall. The construction technique used in the longhouses is ingenious.": "长屋是用芦苇捆成长长的、厚厚的一捆，并弯曲成倒立的U形肋骨制成的。肋骨之间的空间是格子状的，用更多的芦苇做茅草。每个长屋都有一个单一的编织门，位于一端墙壁的中央。长屋中使用的建筑技术是很巧妙的。",
	"The lizardfolk may be technologically backward, but they are masters of their environment. They show the same building talent in their traps and snares.": "蜥蜴人可能在技术上比较落后，但他们是环境的主人。他们在陷阱和圈套中也表现出同样的建筑天赋。",
	"Inside, longhouses are roomy and well ventilated. The ground is covered with reed mats, and the interior is dry and airy. Gear hangs from pegs on the walls to keep it off the ground. Lizardfolk are especially careful with their new, steel weapons, which rust quickly when exposed to dampness. They fill small stone ovens with coals for heat. There are no open fireplaces; the danger from sparks is too great.": "长屋内部很宽敞，通风良好。地上铺着芦苇垫，室内干燥通风。装备挂在墙上的钉子上，使其远离地面。蜥蜴人对他们的新钢制武器特别小心，因为这些武器在潮湿的环境中会很快生锈。他们在小石炉里装上煤块取暖。没有开放的壁炉；火花带来的危险太大。",
	"Each of these longhouses could house twenty-five lizardfolk comfortably, and more with some crowding. When {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} first negotiated with the lizardfolk, they intended to move the entire village here, and built accordingly. As more bullywugs also flocked to the castle and the real situation became apparent, the warriors instructed their families to stay behind. Thus, they have far more longhouse space at the castle than they need. Characters observing the area from hiding and judging solely from the longhouses would estimate conservatively that over a hundred lizardfolk live at the castle. They won't count anywhere near that many lizardfolk in the clearing. Snapjaw can explain the discrepancy, if he's around.": "每个长屋都可以舒适地容纳二十五个蜥蜴人，在有些拥挤的情况下可以容纳更多。当{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}第一次与蜥蜴人谈判时，他们打算把整个村子搬到这里，并据此建造。随着更多的bullywugs也涌向城堡，真正的情况变得明显，战士们指示他们的家人留下来。因此，他们在城堡里的长屋空间远远超过了他们的需要。从隐蔽处观察该地区并仅从长屋判断的人物会保守地估计，有超过一百个蜥蜴人住在城堡里。他们不会算出空地上有多少蜥蜴人。如果Snapjaw在的话，他可以解释这个差异。",
	"The bullywugs live in huts, which are crudely built.": "欺负人的人住在小屋中，这些小屋建造得很粗糙。",
	"A dozen or more huts are placed haphazardly on the boggy ground. Each is shaped like a slightly flattened dome. The doorways are open, but a low, short tunnel forces a creature to crawl into the hut. They are made of reeds woven through a lattice, with a generous layer of mud, grass, and dung smeared over the whole thing. Mud, swamp water, and muck slops between the huts and even flows in and out of the low, open doorways.": "十几间小屋胡乱地摆放在沼泽地上。每间的形状都像一个略微压扁的圆顶。门口是敞开的，但一条低矮的短隧道迫使生物爬进小屋。它们是由芦苇编织成的格子，上面抹了一层厚厚的泥巴、草和粪便。泥浆、沼泽水和淤泥在小屋之间滑动，甚至从低矮、敞开的门洞中流进和流出。",
	"The interiors of the bullywugs' huts are the complete opposite of the lizardfolk's longhouses: wet, filthy, sloppily made, and reeking. The floors aren't just damp; they're churned into mud pits up to 2 feet deep, so the bullywugs can rest froglike in mud up to their eyeballs. They have no sense of privacy or personal space. At night, they crowd in atop one another until everyone is squeezed. Bullywugs aren't assigned to any particular huts. They sleep in whichever is most convenient when they grow tired, so it's common for some huts to be packed at night while others sit completely empty.": "恶霸的小屋的内部结构与蜥蜴人的长屋完全相反：潮湿、肮脏、制作粗糙，而且散发着恶臭。地板不仅潮湿，而且被搅成了两英尺深的泥坑，所以恶霸们可以像青蛙一样在泥浆中休息，直到他们的眼睛。他们没有隐私或个人空间的意识。到了晚上，他们互相挤在一起，直到每个人都被挤垮。恶霸并不被分配到任何特定的小屋。当他们累了的时候，就睡在最方便的地方，所以晚上有些小屋挤满了人，而另一些小屋却完全空着，这很常见。",
	"The castle's exterior walls average 10 feet thick. Interior walls are also stone but only about 1 or 2 feet thick.": "城堡的外墙平均有10英尺厚。内部墙壁也是石头，但只有大约1或2英尺厚。",
	"Most of the structures inside the castle are more than one story tall. In the descriptions, areas are identified by floor, then letter, so {@area area 1L|152|x} is on the ground floor,{@area  2L|168|x} the second floor, and so on. If an area doesn't have an entry for a floor, then it doesn't exist on that floor.": "城堡内的大部分建筑都有一层以上的高度。在描述中，区域是以楼层来标识的，然后是字母，所以{@area area 1L|152|x}是在一楼，{@area  2L|168|x}是二楼，以此类推。如果一个区域没有一个楼层的条目，那么它就不存在于那个楼层。",
	"The barbican has no windows or arrow slits at ground level. During daytime, bright light is within 20 feet of the open gateway and the open doorway to the causeway. Everywhere else, oil lamps cast only dim light (because the bullywugs never clean them).": "该壁垒在地面上没有窗户或箭缝。白天，明亮的光线在开放的大门和通往堤道的开放门洞的20英尺内。其他地方，油灯只投下昏暗的光线（因为恶霸们从不清洗它们）。",
	"This 180-foot causeway crosses the moat and leads to the castle's outer ward.

They attack anyone they don't recognize or who isn't accompanied by someone they recognize.": "最初，外区和内区之间的通道可以用厚重的木门关闭，但它们早已散架，没有被替换。内院每天都有三个{@creature Guard Drake|HotDQ|guard drakes}（统计数字见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}）的人在巡逻。他们攻击任何他们不认识的人或没有他们认识的人陪同的人。",
	"The door to this tower has been torn off its hinges and lies on the ground. Originally, a wooden floor was at ground level with a pit beneath it for confining prisoners. The wooden floor is completely rotted away, and the pit has been filled nearly to ground level with garbage and mud.": "这座塔的门已经被扯掉了铰链，躺在地上。最初，地面上有一个木质地板，地板下有一个坑，用于关押囚犯。木质地板已经完全腐烂，坑里的垃圾和泥土已经几乎填到了地面。",
	"There must have been a wooden floor in this tower when it was built, to cover the dungeon pit beneath it. Now the floor is gone and the dungeon has been turned into a garbage pit and latrine filled with foul-smelling waste and swamp water to just a few feet below the level of the doorway. The floor above is badly rotted and large portions have collapsed. Through the gaping holes in the second floor, you can see that the third floor is still in good condition. But to reach the stone stairs that circle upward around the outer wall, you must cross 10 feet of indescribable muck.": "这座塔在建造时肯定有一个木质地板，以覆盖下面的地牢坑。现在地板不见了，地牢已经变成了一个垃圾坑和厕所，里面充满了恶臭的废物和沼泽水，只比门口的高度低几英尺。上面的地板已经严重腐烂，大部分已经倒塌。透过二楼的缺口，你可以看到三楼的状况还不错。但要到达绕着外墙向上的石阶，你必须穿过10英尺长的难以形容的泥土。",

	"Twelve bullywugs eye you suspiciously from a room that might have been a tidy barracks once. Now it is largely empty of furniture, much of the floor is churned into mud, and the stink of bullywugs permeates everything.": "在一个曾经可能是整洁的军营的房间里，12只小霸王怀疑地看着你。现在，这里基本上没有家具，大部分地板被搅成了泥浆，恶霸的臭味弥漫在一切地方。",
	"If the bullywugs assume the characters are cultists, they tolerate their presence here on the lowest floor of the barracks.

	"Three mud-spattered chests are shoved into the sheltered space behind the staircase. These contain much of the bullywugs' accumulated pay. {@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} pays them with articles of looted treasure that he deems too cheap or tacky to include in the hoard being accumulated for Tiamat. The chests contain hundreds of items made from copper and tin and that incorporate small or damaged semiprecious stones. The three chests combined contain 30,000 cp, 500 sp, and jewelry (copper and tin with ornamental or semiprecious stones) worth another 350 gp, for a total value of 700 gp. Their total weight is over 500 pounds: 305 pounds of coins plus another 200 pounds of jewelry.": "三个溅满泥浆的箱子被塞进了楼梯后面的遮蔽空间。这些箱子里装着恶霸们积累的大部分报酬。{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}用他认为太便宜或太俗气的掠夺来的宝物来支付他们，这些宝物是为提亚马特积累的。这些箱子里有数百件由铜和锡制成的物品，其中包括小型或损坏的半宝石。这三个箱子里有30,000cp，500sp，以及价值350gp的珠宝（铜和锡与装饰性或半宝石），总价值为700gp。它们的总重量超过500磅。305磅的硬币加上另外200磅的珠宝。",

	"A large forge dominates the center of this chamber, which is pleasantly warm thanks to a bed of coals glowing dully in the forge. Half a dozen lizardfolk are working around the forge, but they don't seem to be accomplishing much. Other accouterments of the blacksmith's trade are scattered through the room, and many very poorly made metal items are heaped in the northwest corner.": "一个大的锻炉占据了这个房间的中心位置，由于锻炉里有一床炭火在黯淡地发光，所以它的温度很舒服。半打蜥蜴人正围着锻炉工作，但他们似乎并没有取得什么成果。房间里还散落着铁匠的其他工具，西北角还堆放着许多做工很差的金属制品。",
	"A few months ago, {@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} decided to put the forge back into operation. He despises Pharblex and the bullywugs, and he would prefer to deal solely with the lizardfolk if they could overcome the gloom that has gripped the tribe since Pharblex murdered their shaman. Borngray thought mastering a craft as advanced as metalworking would instill the lizardfolk with a renewed sense of pride. He might be right, but so far, the lizardfolk have shown little aptitude for the craft. They do, however, enjoy basking in the warmth of the forge, and they have learned to take excellent care of their new weapons even if they can't manufacture more.": "几个月前，{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}决定将锻造厂重新投入运营。他鄙视法布尔克斯和恶霸，如果蜥蜴人能够克服法布尔克斯谋杀他们的萨满后笼罩在部落中的阴霾，他更愿意只和蜥蜴人打交道。博恩格雷认为，掌握像金属加工这样先进的工艺会给蜥蜴人带来新的自豪感。他可能是对的，但到目前为止，蜥蜴人没有表现出对这门手艺的能力。然而，他们确实喜欢沐浴在锻造的温暖中，而且他们已经学会了很好地照顾他们的新武器，即使他们不能制造更多的武器。",
	"The six {@creature lizardfolk} in the forge room won't attack unless they are antagonized first. They are trying to make an iron spear point from scraps of ruined armor, but their effort is producing something more like a shovel than a blade. They listen attentively if characters offer advice but show no sign of comprehending what they're told.": "锻造室里的六个{@creature lizardfolk}人不会攻击，除非他们先被敌视。他们正试图用废旧盔甲的碎片制作一个铁矛尖，但他们的努力产生的东西更像是一把铲子而不是一把刀。如果有人物提供建议，他们会认真倾听，但没有迹象表明他们会理解所讲的内容。",
	"Like guards elsewhere in the castle, those in this room assume that strangers are newly arrived cultists unless they have reason to think otherwise (seeing strangers with weapons dripping blood from recent combat would be one such reason). They won't attack unless provoked, but they won't let anyone go upstairs or into areas 1J and 1K without an excellent reason, either.": "和城堡里其他地方的守卫一样，这个房间里的人认为陌生人是新来的邪教徒，除非他们有理由不这么认为（看到陌生人的武器在最近的战斗中滴着血就是这样一个理由）。除非受到挑衅，否则他们不会攻击，但如果没有充分的理由，他们也不会让任何人上楼或进入1J和1K区域。",
	"Over the years, this chapel has been consecrated to several different deities, depending on who ruled the castle. Now it is a shrine to Tiamat, adorned with a handsome wooden statue of the dragon queen crafted by lizardfolk. The workmanship is surprisingly good, though most of Tiamat's visages bear a stronger resemblance to lizardfolk than to dragons. The cultists venerate Tiamat but do not worship her, so the chapel is seldom used for anything that could be considered a religious observance or mass. Instead, individual cultists or small groups sometimes retire here for quiet reflection on how the world will suffer when the Queen of Dragons rises.": "多年来，这个小教堂一直被献给几个不同的神灵，这取决于谁统治了城堡。现在它是提亚马特的神龛，装饰着蜥蜴人制作的龙后的漂亮的木制雕像。做工出奇的好，尽管提亚马特的大部分面孔与蜥蜴人的相似度比与龙的相似度更高。崇拜者们敬仰提亚马特，但并不崇拜她，所以小教堂很少用于任何可被视为宗教仪式或弥撒的场合。相反，个别崇拜者或小团体有时会在这里静静地思考，当龙后崛起时，世界将遭受怎样的痛苦。",
	"All the trash from the chapel—broken stools, rotted altar cloths, corroded icons—was dumped in this room when the cultists took over. There's nothing of value here.": "教堂里所有的垃圾--破损的凳子、腐烂的祭坛布、腐蚀的圣像--都在邪教分子接管时被扔在这个房间里。这里没有任何有价值的东西。",
	"This was originally the castle priest's living quarters, and it included many sturdy storage cabinets for vestments and religious paraphernalia. All the cabinets were hacked open and looted long ago.

	"Meals for the cultists are prepared in this kitchen by a dwarf chef and his two human helpers ({@creature Commoner||commoners}). The chef is a dwarf named Tharm Tharmzid. If given the chance, he complains bitterly about the lack of ingredients here for good meals.

	"The cultists eat their meals and conduct most of their business in this high, wide hall. The eastern end of the hall is used for dining and socializing. The western half is where contraband hauled in from the Carnath Roadhouse is inspected, sorted, and repacked before being carried to the portal beneath the southwest tower. The tables in that half of the hall are covered with valuables.": "邪教徒们在这个高而宽的大厅里吃饭并处理大部分事务。大厅的东端是用来吃饭和社交的。西半部是检查、分类和重新包装从卡纳斯路屋拖来的违禁品的地方，然后再运到西南塔下的入口。大厅那一半的桌子上摆满了贵重物品。",

	"Swamp water seeps into this chamber through a crack in the foundation to pool inches deep on the sagging stone floor and fill the air with a cloying, moldy stink. The cultists laid a walkway of planks across the floor so they can walk between the two doorways without soaking their feet. This chamber isn't used for anything other than a passage between areas 1Q and 1R.": "沼泽水通过地基的裂缝渗入这个密室，在下陷的石板上积了几英寸深，空气中充满了令人厌恶的霉味。邪教分子在地板上铺设了一条木板通道，这样他们就可以在两个门洞之间行走，而不会弄湿他们的脚。这个密室除了作为1Q区和1R区之间的通道外，没有其他用途。",

	"This front chamber is a small version of the Great Hall, with a few tables and benches that are seldom used. Spiral stairs lead up to the second floor.": "这个前厅是大礼堂的一个小版本，有几张很少使用的桌子和长椅。螺旋形的楼梯通向二楼。",
	"This level of the barbican has no roof. Hundreds of melon-sized stones are piled around the battlements for throwing down on the heads of attackers. Many of the piles have collapsed, and the bullywugs are too lazy to restack them.": "这一层的壁垒没有屋顶。数以百计的瓜子大小的石头堆在城垛周围，用来砸向攻击者的头。许多石堆已经坍塌，恶霸们也懒得重新堆放。",
	"The causeway is fully exposed to archers positioned at the rear of the barbican, but the bullywugs seldom watch that direction.": "堤道完全暴露在驻扎在壁垒后方的弓箭手面前，但恶霸们很少注意这个方向。",
	"The main feature of this area is a signal drum carved from an enormous hollow log. This drum can be heard for miles when it is beaten vigorously. The bullywugs send many different signals with the drum: they can recall patrols and foragers to the castle, wake up the camp, indicate mealtimes, announce changes of the guard, and sound a general alarm if the castle ever comes under attack. The drum is heard about six times on a typical day, and everyone who lives at the castle knows the meanings of the different drumbeats. Characters won't know what they mean without asking someone.": "这个地区的主要特征是一个由巨大的空心木头雕刻成的信号鼓。这面鼓在大力敲击时，可以听到数英里之外。恶霸们用鼓发出许多不同的信号：他们可以把巡逻队和觅食者召回城堡，唤醒营地，指示用餐时间，宣布卫兵的变化，如果城堡受到攻击，则发出总的警报。在一个典型的日子里，鼓声大约有六次，每个住在城堡里的人都知道不同鼓声的含义。如果不问别人，人物是不会知道它们的含义的。",
	"The second level of the northwest tower is in bad shape. There are large holes where the floorboards have completely rotted away or fallen into the muck below, and the floorboards that remain are unlikely to support a human's weight. The beams are still strong, but they are slick with fungus and mold. A successful DC 10 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check is needed to cross the level on a beam without slipping and falling into the awfulness of {@area area 1E|148|x}.": "西北塔的第二层情况很糟糕。有一些大洞，地板已经完全腐烂或掉入下面的淤泥中，剩下的地板不太可能支撑人的重量。横梁仍然很结实，但上面沾满了真菌和霉菌。需要成功地进行DC10灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）检查，才能在横梁上穿过这一层，而不至于滑倒，跌入{@area area 1E|148|x}的可怕境地。",
	"The stone steps that wind around the outer wall come to a small (approximately 3 feet by 3 feet) stone landing, then continue upward to the third level. Characters are safe from falling as long as they stay on the landing or the steps.": "绕过外墙的石阶来到一个小的（大约3英尺乘3英尺）石台，然后继续向上走到第三层。只要人物停留在平台或台阶上，就不会跌落。",
	"A trapdoor closes off the top of the stairs at the ceiling. The door is latched with a simple wooden turn-button. The door also bears a warning but, because the warning was drawn in chalk nearly a century ago, it is all but invisible now. It can be noticed with a successful DC20 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. After the chalk mark is noticed, anyone who reads Dwarvish can correctly interpret it as a warning that powerful undead reside in the room beyond. Adventurers placed the rune here decades ago after running afoul of the specters in {@area area 3E|172|x}.": "一个活板门关闭了楼梯顶部的天花板。门是用一个简单的木质旋转按钮锁上的。门上还有一个警告，但由于警告是近一个世纪前用粉笔画的，现在几乎看不到了。只要成功地进行DC20智慧({@skill Perception})检查，就能注意到它。在注意到这个粉笔标记后，任何能读懂矮人语的人都能正确地将其解释为一个警告，即强大的亡灵居住在房间之外。几十年前，冒险家们在与{@area area 3E|172|x}的幽灵相遇后，将符文放在这里。",
	"Across the tower, up against the south wall, is a single, locked trunk. The lock can be opened with a set of {@item thieves' tools|PHB} and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. The chest contains 1,825 cp, 54 sp, and a pair of garish gold earrings that would be worth another 10 gp if melted. The chest was left behind when the last tenants of the castle departed, being considered not worth the effort to lug down the stairs.": "在塔的对面，靠南墙的地方，有一个上了锁的箱子。用一套{@item thieves' tools|PHB}和一个成功的DC10灵巧检查可以打开锁。箱子里有1,825便士，54英镑，还有一对花花绿绿的金耳环，如果融化了，还能再值10便士。这个箱子是在城堡的最后一批住户离开时留下的，因为他们认为不值得费力地拖下楼梯。",
	"The loft above the stables is where the lizardfolk store bundles of cut reeds to use as bedding in the stalls of the giant lizards. Other than reeds and a few bats, nothing else is here.": "马厩上方的阁楼是蜥蜴人存放成捆割下的芦苇的地方，用来作为巨型蜥蜴人马厩的铺垫。除了芦苇和几只蝙蝠之外，这里没有其他东西了。",
	"{@creature Pharblex Spattergoo|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12} for statistics) and his personal retinue of ten {@creature Bullywug||bullywugs} use this level of the barracks as their living quarters. No one else has any business being in this chamber, including cultists. Not even Borngray or {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} herself are welcome here. The bullywugs are always here at night but only two stand guard over the treasure chest during the day, when Pharblex spends most of his time in the giant frog hatchery beneath the castle. Those two guards trust no one, and one of them is equipped with a horn made of crocodile bone with which to sound the alarm if trouble develops.": "{@creature Pharblex Spattergoo|HotDQ}(统计数字见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12})和他的十名私人随从{@creature Bullywug||bullywugs}将这一层的兵营作为他们的生活区。其他任何人都无权进入这个房间，包括邪教分子。甚至博恩格雷和{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}她本人在这里都不受欢迎。恶霸们晚上总是在这里，但白天只有两个人在宝箱前站岗，这时法布尔克斯大部分时间都在城堡下面的巨型青蛙孵化场。这两个守卫不相信任何人，其中一个配备了一个鳄鱼骨制成的喇叭，如果出现麻烦，可以用它发出警报。",
	"Like all areas occupied by bullywugs, this chamber is a mess. Reed pallets, dirty baskets, and animal bones litter the floor.": "像所有被恶霸占据的区域一样，这个房间也是一片混乱。芦苇托盘、肮脏的篮子和动物骨头散落在地板上。",
	"In the southeast corner of the room is a large, sturdy chest, wrapped in chains and padlocked. The lock can be picked with {@item thieves' tools|PHB} and a successful DC 12 Dexterity check. Inside is Pharblex's share of the bullywugs' pay: silver and electrum jewelry, hand mirrors, shell combs, hair pins and brooches with semiprecious stones, all with a total value of 1,376 gp. Most of the silver is black from tarnish. In a civilized land, every one of these items is something that would be found on a woman's dressing table or nightstand. This is a private joke that {@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} finds quietly hilarious. It's all the same to Pharblex, since he knows nothing of civilization or the fashions of human noblewomen.": "在房间的东南角有一个结实的大箱子，用铁链包裹着，挂着锁。锁可以用{@item thieves' tools|PHB}和成功的DC12灵巧检查来打开。里面放着法尔布拉斯的那份恶霸的报酬：银质和电子珠宝、手镜、贝壳梳子、发夹和带半宝石的胸针，总价值为1,376戈比。大部分的银子都因为变色而变黑了。在一个文明的国度里，这些物品中的每一件都是会在女人的梳妆台或床头柜上找到的东西。这是一个私人笑话，{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}觉得悄悄地很搞笑。对法布尔克斯来说，这都是一样的，因为他对文明和人类贵族妇女的时尚一无所知。",
	"This chamber was stocked with armor, weapons, and hundreds of arrows when the castle was abandoned. The metal rusted to dust, the arrows warped into uselessness, and the leather was chewed away by rats and other vermin. Now this chamber is the unofficial headquarters of the lizardfolk in the castle. Neither the bullywugs nor the cultists ever come up here.": "当城堡被遗弃时，这个密室储存了盔甲、武器和数百支箭。金属锈迹斑斑，箭矢变形无用，皮革被老鼠和其他害虫咬坏了。现在这个房间是城堡里蜥蜴人的非官方总部。恶霸和邪教徒都不曾到这里来。",
	"The lizardfolk's stockpile of new weapons is hidden beneath stacks of rusted, rotten, century-old arms. Just a few minutes of searching through the junk can turn up one or two bundles of sharp, clean blades for shortswords, daggers, and spears, neatly wrapped in oilskin.": "蜥蜴人的新武器储备藏在一堆生锈的、腐烂的、百年的武器下面。只要在这些垃圾中搜寻几分钟，就能发现一两捆锋利、干净的短剑、匕首和长矛的刀片，用油皮整齐地包裹着。",
	"Unless the lizardfolk are meeting, this chamber usually is empty. The lizardfolk seldom come here when they could be observed gathering, to avoid attracting suspicion or making anyone curious about what's in the unused room above the forge.": "除非蜥蜴人在开会，这个房间通常是空的。蜥蜴人很少在可以观察到他们聚会的时候来这里，以避免引起怀疑或让人对锻造厂上面的闲置房间里的东西感到好奇。",
	"{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} assigned the entire northeast tower to the lizardfolk for their use, but they sleep and live mainly on the ground floor. The second-floor rooms contain nothing of interest or value.": "{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}将整个东北塔分配给蜥蜴人使用，但他们主要在一楼睡觉和生活。二楼的房间里没有任何有意义或有价值的东西。",
	"{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} has converted the second floor of the chapel into a library. This chamber at the top of the stairs contains a few crates and chests of books culled from the arriving treasure that haven't been sorted and cataloged yet. ": "{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}已经把小教堂的二楼改成了图书馆。楼梯顶端的这个密室里有几箱和几柜子的书，这些书是从抵达的宝藏中挑选出来的，还没有经过分类和编目。",
	"A small table and two chairs are the only furnishings in this chamber.": "一张小桌子和两把椅子是这个房间里唯一的家具。",
	"Since treasure first started funneling through Naerytar, {@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} has pulled out any books, parchments, tablets, and other written material that interested him. He knows better than to claim them as his own; he will forward these treasures to Tiamat's hoard when the work at Castle Naerytar draws to a close. Until then, he keeps the written material at the castle to study and to divert him from the miserable surroundings. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} knows about the library and approves of using the books this way, as long as they are delivered to the Well of Dragons before Tiamat's arrival.": "自从宝藏第一次开始通过Naerytar输送，{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}就拿出了任何他感兴趣的书籍、羊皮纸、石板和其他书面材料。他知道最好不要把它们据为己有；当Naerytar城堡的工作接近尾声时，他将把这些宝藏转交给Tiamat的囤积物。在那之前，他把这些书面材料放在城堡里研究，以转移他对悲惨环境的注意力。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}知道图书馆的情况，并同意以这种方式使用这些书，只要在提亚马特到来之前将它们送到龙之井。",
	"Borngray has assembled an impressive library. It contains over one hundred books, quartos, and manuscripts covering the history of the Sword Coast, natural philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, magic, and many theoretical works on alternate reality, time, and dimensional travel. This collection would be a priceless addition to any library or collector in Waterdeep if it could be removed from the castle before the cultists spirit it away or the bullywugs spoil it.": "博恩格雷已经组建了一个令人印象深刻的图书馆。它包含了一百多本书籍、四开本和手稿，涵盖了剑海岸的历史、自然哲学、数学、天文学、魔法，以及许多关于替代现实、时间和维度旅行的理论著作。如果能在邪教分子把它运走或被恶霸破坏之前把它从城堡里移走，那么这套藏书对沃特迪普的任何图书馆或收藏家来说都是无价之宝。",
	"This chamber is a combination sitting room and office, and a small hearth along the western wall provides heat. A writing desk, a large padded chair, and a bench are drawn up near the hearth.": "这个房间是起居室和办公室的组合，沿西墙有一个小炉灶提供热量。一张写字台、一把大的软垫椅和一张长凳被拉到炉膛附近。",
	"Area 2V is Borngray's sleeping chamber, furnished with a bed, a carpet-draped table with a wash basin and grooming supplies (comb, brush, soap, scented waters), and a stool. Rugs cover most of the floor. A raven in a large cage squawks loudly enough to be heard in the outer ward if a stranger enters the chamber, and the squawking awakens and draws the cultists and dragonwings from areas 2R and 2T to the tower. Borngray is seldom here except when sleeping, immediately before retiring, and immediately after rising.": "2V区是博恩格雷的睡房，配有一张床，一张铺着地毯的桌子，上面有一个洗脸盆和梳理用品（梳子、刷子、肥皂、香水），还有一张凳子。地板上大部分都铺着地毯。一只关在大笼子里的乌鸦大声地叫着，如果有陌生人进入密室，就会在外面的病房里听到，叫声会唤醒并把2R和2T区的邪教徒和龙翼吸引到塔上。除了睡觉时、退休前和起床后，博恩格雷很少在这里。",
	"In addition to the elf's clothing and personal effects, a small strongbox is hidden beneath a loose floorboard under a rug. The hiding place is spotted automatically if the rug is moved and missed automatically if the rug is left alone. The strongbox contains Borngray's emergency funds: 200 gp, 200 sp, and 10 precious stones worth 100 gp each. The locked box can be opened with a key from Borngray's belt or with a set of {@item thieves' tools|PHB} and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.": "除了精灵的衣服和个人物品外，在地毯下的一块松动的地板下还藏有一个小的保险箱。如果地毯被移动，藏匿地点会被自动发现；如果地毯被单独放置，则会被自动错过。箱子里有Borngray的应急资金：200GP，200SP，以及10颗各价值100GP的宝石。上锁的箱子可以用Borngray腰带上的钥匙打开，或者用一套{@item thieves' tools|PHB}和成功的DC15灵巧检查。",
	"Many of the topmost levels of the castle are unused by cultists. Some of them are still home to dangerous creatures that were sealed off instead of being cleared out.": "城堡的许多最顶层都没有被邪教分子使用。其中一些仍然是危险生物的家，它们被封存而不是被清理出去。",
	"The open chamber contains a large table and star charts in scroll racks around the walls. Three bodies are sprawled on the floor, reduced by time to powdery bones and dusty tatters of cloth. As soon as Someone enters the room, they rise as specters and attack. They pursue anywhere in the castle, but they won't leave the castle. They attack other living creatures if they can't get at those who disturbed their rest, but they prefer the intruders over anyone else.": "开放的房间里有一张大桌子，墙壁周围的卷轴架上有星图。三具尸体横七竖八地躺在地板上，随着时间的推移，已经变成了粉状的骨头和尘封的破布。只要有人进入房间，他们就会像幽灵一样站起来，进行攻击。他们在城堡的任何地方追击，但他们不会离开城堡。如果它们不能对付那些打扰它们休息的人，它们就会攻击其他生物，但它们更喜欢入侵者而不是其他人。",
	"Most of the paper star charts crumble into dust when touched, but three are still sturdy enough to be carried away. One of these was drawn on parchment, one scribed on a clay disc, and one etched on thinly rolled copper. The surviving charts would fetch 700 gp each from an astrologer in Waterdeep or other major city.": "大多数纸质星图一碰就碎成灰尘，但有三张仍然很结实，可以被运走。其中一张画在羊皮纸上，一张刻在泥盘上，还有一张蚀刻在薄薄的铜板上。现存的图表可以从沃特德普或其他主要城市的占星家那里得到700金币一张。",
	"Originally, this level of the barracks was used for storage and for training during severe weather. Several fencing dummies and targets still stand around the room, but they fall apart if put to hard use.": "最初，军营的这一层是用来储存和在恶劣天气下进行训练的。房间周围仍然矗立着几个击剑假人和靶子，但如果被用力使用，它们就会散架。",
	"Two matched onyx carvings of black dragons flank the top of the staircase. A serious collector would pay up to 3,000 gp for the pair. They are three feet tall and weigh 400 pounds apiece.": "楼梯顶部有两个相配的黑龙玛瑙雕刻，两侧是黑龙。一个严肃的收藏家会为这对龙支付高达3000金币的价格。它们有三英尺高，每条都有400磅重。",
	"This chamber is a sitting room, comfortably furnished with upholstered chairs, padded benches, and two small carpet-draped tables. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} does not entertain guests, so the chamber is never used by anyone but her.": "这个房间是一个起居室，舒适地摆放着软垫椅子、软垫长椅和两张铺着地毯的小桌子。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}不招待客人，所以这个房间除了她之外从来没有人使用。",
	"A large bed, two wardrobes, a standing mirror, and an armor stand with a spare suit of scale mail armor dominate the room. One of the wardrobes is filled with clothing. The other, whose doors are painted with a depiction of a five-headed dragon, contains {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}'s Cult of the Dragon regalia—purple robes, cloaks, mantles, and many items of rank, but not the {@item Black Dragon Mask|HotDQ}. Because {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} is a half-dragon, it's unlikely that her clothing or armor will fit anyone else.": "房间里有一张大床，两个衣柜，一面站立的镜子，以及一个装着备用鳞甲的盔甲架。其中一个衣柜里装满了衣服。另一个柜子的门上画着一条五头龙的图案，里面放着{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}的神龙教服饰--紫色长袍、斗篷、披风和许多等级的物品，但没有{@item Black Dragon Mask|HotDQ}的。因为{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}是半龙人，她的衣服或盔甲不太可能适合其他人。",
	"One of the few easily portable items of value in the room is a 2-foot-tall statuette of a black dragon, made from actual black dragon scales and claws, with ruby eyes and diamond teeth. It is perched atop a heap of treasure consisting of actual gold and gems. Its value to a collector is 4,800 gp, and it weighs only 20 pounds. Rough handling will damage it, however, and reduce its value to just 1,200 gp.": "房间里少数几个容易携带的有价值的物品之一是一个2英尺高的黑龙雕像，由真正的黑龙鳞片和爪子制成，有红宝石的眼睛和钻石的牙齿。它坐落在一堆由真正的黄金和宝石组成的宝物之上。对收藏家来说，它的价值是4800金币，而且只有20磅重。然而，粗暴的处理会损坏它，使其价值降低到只有1,200金币。",
	"This chamber is where {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} retires to venerate Tiamat privately. The room is bare. Its only decoration is a stylized depiction of a five-headed dragon rising from a volcano, painted on the back of the door (where it won't be seen unless someone closes the door while they're in this room). The artist had only a few colors to work with and was not especially talented, but the five heads are recognizable as the five chromatic dragons.": "这个房间是{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}退休后私下祭祀提亚马特的地方。房间里没有任何东西。它唯一的装饰是一幅五头龙从火山中升起的风格化描绘，画在门的背面（除非有人在这个房间里关上门，否则不会被看到）。画家只有几种颜色可供选择，而且没有特别的天赋，但这五个头可以辨认出是五色龙的样子。",
	"A portion of the roof and northwest wall has collapsed in this chamber, so it isn't used for anything. The door to area 3R is always kept closed but not locked.": "这个密室的一部分屋顶和西北墙已经坍塌，所以它并没有被用来做什么。通往3R区的门始终保持关闭，但没有上锁。",
	"The six cultists who share area 3R use this chamber for studying their spellbooks and for practicing their magical craft. The chamber contains three stools, three writing desks, and a basin of water.": "共用3R区域的六个邪教徒用这个房间来研究他们的法术书和练习他们的魔法工艺。这个房间里有三张凳子、三张写字台和一盆水。",
	"The Stargazers converted the top level of the keep into an astrological observatory. The most interesting device they installed was a {@i farseer of Illusk}—a telescope-like contraption that is useful for observing and studying heavenly bodies but which can also be used in a manner similar to an {@spell arcane eye} spell. In that mode, the {@i farseer} can view a location within fifty miles of it. Tuning and focusing the device this way calls for a considerable amount of skill and practice, and the device's dilapidated condition makes the process more difficult.": "观星者们将堡垒的顶层改造成一个星象观测站。他们安装的最有趣的设备是一个{@i farseer of Illusk}--一种类似望远镜的装置，对观察和研究天体很有用，但也可以用类似于{@spell arcane eye}咒语的方式使用。在这种模式下，{@i farseer}可以查看它周围50英里内的位置。以这种方式调整和聚焦设备需要相当多的技巧和练习，而设备的破旧状况使这个过程更加困难。",
	"When characters find it, the {@i farseer} is focused on Waervaerendor's lair. This is a golden opportunity for characters to learn Voaraghamanthar's secret.": "当人物找到它时，{@i farseer}就会集中到Waervaerendor的巢穴。这是人物了解瓦拉格哈曼瑟尔秘密的黄金机会。",
	"Characters might try to take this item when they leave. The farseer is bulky (approximately 40 pounds) and fragile. Worst of all, it has suffered almost two centuries of neglect. The least amount of rough handling will shatter it. A team of brass-smiths and sages, working patiently, might be able to remove the device from Castle Naerytar intact, but adventurers working in haste have no chance.": "角色离开时可能会试图带走这个物品。这个法器很笨重（大约40磅）而且很脆弱。最糟糕的是，它已经遭受了近两个世纪的忽视。最起码的粗暴处理都会使它碎裂。一组铜匠和圣人耐心地工作，也许能从奈瑞塔城堡中完整地取出这个装置，但匆忙工作的冒险者没有机会。",
	"The caverns beneath Castle Naerytar are accessible through {@area area 1S|15b|x}. At the top, the steps are smooth and well made. As they descend, they are rougher, make several turns, and descend about 20 feet to area 1 of the dungeon map. This subterranean area is largely the realm of the bullywugs, who breed giant frogs in the cold lake. Pharblex spends most of his time down here, as do his bodyguards and many workers.": "通过{@area area 1S|15b|x}可以进入奈瑞塔城堡下面的洞穴。在顶部，台阶很光滑，做得很好。下降时，台阶比较粗糙，拐了几个弯，下降了大约20英尺，到达地下城地图的1号区域。这个地下区域主要是恶霸蛙的领域，它们在寒冷的湖水中繁殖巨蛙。法尔布雷斯大部分时间都在这里度过，他的保镖和许多工人也是如此。",
	"Everywhere the walls drip water and the floor is slick with moisture. The temperature is a steady 50 degrees. There are no doors in the caverns.": "墙壁上到处都在滴水，地板上滑腻腻的。温度是稳定的50度。岩洞里没有门。",
	"Cavern ceilings are 10 feet high except where noted otherwise.": "除另有说明外，洞穴的天花板为10英尺高。",
	"Area 1 is brightly lit by lanterns. All other areas have no light.": "第1区有明亮的灯笼照明。所有其他区域都没有灯光。",
	"The caverns are filled with the faint sounds of dripping water, scratching rodents, and scrabbling lizards. Sound does not carry well; the sound of a fight travels into neighboring chambers and attracts attention if the fight lasts more than three rounds.": "洞穴里充满了微弱的滴水声、啮齿动物的抓挠声和蜥蜴的爬行声。声音并不能很好地传播；战斗的声音会传到邻近的房间，如果战斗持续超过三个回合，就会引起注意。",
	"The water flooding the center of the chamber is little more than a puddle; it reaches a depth of 1 foot near the center. The water is slightly acidic, but not enough to cause damage. The gap in the wall connecting to area 2 is only about 3 feet high above the water, so most characters must crouch to get through.": "淹没在密室中心的水只不过是一个水坑；它在中心附近达到1英尺的深度。水是微酸性的，但不足以造成损害。连接第2区的墙壁缝隙离水面只有约3英尺高，因此大多数角色必须蹲下才能通过。",
	"Searching characters do see the glint of gems beneath the water at the east end of the chamber. Fishing through that area turns up a handful of fancy and semiprecious stones worth 1,800 gp (2 × 50 gp, 5 × 100 gp, 200 gp, 400 gp, 600 gp). The gems came from a less-than-devoted cultist who throws a fistful of coins and other treasure items into area 2 every time he gets the chance. His plan is to come back to the castle after the cult leaves and collect his \"retirement fund.\" Unknown to him, the ooze living in area 2 scoops up the items when it passes through its lair. All the items except the gems dissolve in the ooze's body. The stones fascinate the creature's tiny brain, so it \"spits out\" the gems in the corner and collects them. The ooze won't bother those who enter, look around, and leave. It fights back if attacked, and it attacks (probably with surprise) anyone who takes gems.": "搜寻的人物确实看到了密室东端水底下的宝石闪光。在那个区域钓鱼，发现了一把价值1,800金币（2×50金币，5×100金币，200金币，400金币，600金币）的花色和半宝石。这些宝石来自一个不太虔诚的邪教徒，他一有机会就会把一大堆硬币和其他宝物扔到2区。他的计划是在邪教组织离开后再回到城堡，领取他的 \"退休基金\"。他不知道的是，生活在2号区域的渗水在经过它的巢穴时，会把这些物品舀走。除了宝石之外，所有的物品都会溶化在渗水的体内。宝石让这个生物的小脑袋着迷，所以它在角落里 \"吐出 \"宝石并收集它们。渗水者不会打扰那些进入的人，四处看看，然后离开。如果受到攻击，它就会反击，而且它还会攻击那些拿走宝石的人（可能是惊讶）。",
	"The floor of this room is flooded a foot deep with sticky, reeking mud, making the whole chamber {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. Bullywugs roll in this mud, both because they enjoy it and for obscure ceremonial purposes mandated by Pharblex. Two {@creature Bullywug||bullywugs} maintain the mud at just the consistency and depth the bullywugs prefer. They don't leap to the attack when characters enter, but they are hostile and quick to anger.": "这个房间的地板被一英尺深的粘稠、发臭的泥浆淹没，使整个房间变得{@quickref difficult terrain||3}。恶霸在这些泥浆里打滚，既是因为他们喜欢，也是为了法布尔克斯规定的隐秘的仪式目的。两个{@creature Bullywug||bullywugs}的人将泥浆维持在恶霸喜欢的浓度和深度。当人物进入时，他们不会跃跃欲试，但他们有敌意，而且很快就会发怒。",
	"The steps to the west descend steeply 10 feet to area 4. A lip of stones across the top of the steps keeps most of the mud from spilling down the steps, but enough slops over to make the steps slippery. Every character who walks down these steps must make a successful DC 8 Dexterity saving throw to avoid tumbling into area 4. The fall causes {@dice 1d4} bludgeoning damage and makes a lot of noise.": "西边的台阶陡然下降了10英尺到4号区域。阶梯顶部有一圈石头挡住了大部分的泥浆，但也有足够的泥浆滑落，使阶梯变得湿滑。每个走下台阶的人都必须成功地做一个DC 8的灵巧救赎，以避免跌入4区。坠落会造成{@dice 1d4}重击伤害，并发出很大的噪音。",
	"The steps to the west descend 5 feet to area 6.": "西边的台阶下降了5英尺到6号区域。",

She intends to try a more powerful form of mind-reading after she can pull together materials.": "Craggnor是邪教成员，也是矮人Varram the White的朋友，他是Talis最痛恨的邪教分子。她抓住了克拉格诺，希望了解她可以利用的弱点，但到目前为止，他抵制了各种贿赂、魔法和身体折磨。她打算在凑齐材料后，尝试一种更强大的读心术。",
	"Brother Caemon suspects that Talis is trying to win him over to the cult, but he also fears that Talis plans to sacrifice him as part of a summoning ritual and is trying the \"catch more flies with honey\" approach to win his freedom.

Caemon doesn't know much, and he is a bit of a kind-hearted fool.": "凯蒙兄弟怀疑塔利斯是为了争取他加入邪教，但他也担心塔利斯计划将他作为召唤仪式的一部分进行牺牲，并试图用 \"用蜂蜜抓更多的苍蝇 \"的方法来赢得自由。塔利斯的善意完全是假的，但它可能会作为一个红鲱鱼迷惑人物。凯蒙知道的不多，他是一个有点善良的傻瓜。",

The villagers want to keep the characters occupied, and they ask for them to tell tales of their journey, they inquire about the characters' families and where they are from, and they query how the party got here.": "从Raggnar和他的客户那里打探消息是很困难的。村民们想让角色们忙起来，他们要求他们讲述他们的旅程，他们询问角色们的家庭和他们来自哪里，他们还询问队伍如何来到这里。",
	"If asked about a place to sleep, Raggnar makes it clear that he isn't an innkeeper: there are no beds or rooms, and even the stable is full. If anyone asks why, he gives his usual excuse: \"Lord Marsten and his entourage are coming to hunt. All the servants are making things ready for their arrival.\" (This is pure nonsense, of course—he has no rooms other than his own.) If the characters just wait a moment, Raggnar says he will offer them his own chambers, for a steep fee of 10 gp. \"I'll clear out a few things and it is all yours.\" This is also a stalling tactic, though he'll certainly take the money.": "如果被问及睡觉的地方，拉格纳明确表示他不是旅馆老板：没有床或房间，甚至连马厩都满了。如果有人问起原因，他就会给出惯常的借口：\"马斯顿大人和他的随行人员要来打猎。所有的仆人都在为他们的到来做准备\"。(当然，这纯属无稽之谈，除了他自己的房间，他没有其他房间。）如果角色们稍等片刻，拉格纳说他会把自己的房间提供给他们，但需要支付10戈比的高昂费用。\"我把一些东西清理出来，它就是你们的了。\" 这也是一种拖延战术，尽管他肯定会接受这笔钱。",
	"Because the cultists are about to ship a castle full of treasure from the village, they desperately don't want the characters to find anything suspicious, such as wagons loaded with chests (there's no room to hide a caravan in a village this small) or their wyvern mounts in the stables (see area 3). If Raggnar can keep the characters eating and drinking and gossiping, then Skyreach Castle can slip away into the sky.": "因为邪教分子要从村子里运走满满一城堡的财宝，所以他们极不希望角色们发现任何可疑的东西，比如装满箱子的马车（这么小的村子里没有空间隐藏商队）或者马厩里的狼人坐骑（见区域3）。如果拉格纳能让人物吃喝玩乐，闲话家常，那么Skyreach城堡就能溜到天上去。",

The difficult part is getting their harnesses attached so that riders don't fall off, and giving the proper commands once airborne.": "马厩（3号区）里的狼牙棒经过训练，可以同时携带两个中型或六个小型骑手。困难的部分是把它们的安全带系上，使骑手不至于掉下来，并在升空后发出适当的指令。",
	"Any character can put the harness on a wyvern with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Animal Handling}) check. If the check fails by 5 or more, the wyvern strenuously objects and attacks the character once with its tail stinger as a reaction. The wyverns aren't choosy about who rides them, but convincing a wyvern to fly or move in a specific direction requires an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Animal Handling}) check; if the check fails, the wyvern ignores the rider's commands until the rider's next turn. After a rider succeeds on two such checks, the wyvern goes where the rider wants for the next hour, or until it takes damage or the rider dismounts.": "任何角色都可以通过成功的DC 10智慧({@skill Animal Handling})检查将安全带套在狼人身上。如果检定失败5次或更多，狼獾会极力反对，并作为反应用它的尾刺攻击该角色一次。狼人对骑乘它们的人并不挑剔，但说服狼人飞行或向一个特定的方向移动需要一个行动来进行DC15智慧（{@skill Animal Handling}）检查；如果检查失败，狼人将忽略骑手的命令，直到骑手的下一个回合。在骑手成功地进行了两次这样的检查后，在接下来的一小时内，狼獾会去骑手想要去的地方，或者直到它受到伤害或骑手下马。",

	"Eons ago, cloud giants built this flying fortress to take their ancient battle against dragonkind into the skies. The spirit of a giant enables it to fly—this ancient bond dates back to the days when giants and dragons fought great wars.

The NPCs have dozens of servants, cultists, and guards at their disposal. If more than one or two of these turn up dead, the cultists search the castle for the killers.": "这些对手并不完全信任对方，也不可能对人物形成统一战线。相反，巨人为保卫他们的家园而战，邪教分子和龙为保卫他们的宝藏而战。如果角色们明智地出手，这种缺乏信任的情况将成为恶棍们的败笔。NPC们有几十个仆人、邪教徒和卫兵供他们使用。如果这些人中死了一两个以上，邪教分子就会在城堡里寻找凶手。",

The path only confirms what characters already know: there were a lot of them, and they were a mix of humans, kobolds, and trained reptiles. One bit of information can be gleaned with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check: Many of the beasts' footprints are deeper on the retreat than they were on the approach march.

So, when he deemed the time was just about right, he visited the town with the intent of staying until something happened. His observations paid off, and Leosin separated from his people during the night and fell in with the raiders when they retreated, hoping to learn more about the cult's plans and the location of their camp. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} spotted him after the sun came up, and the monk was quickly overpowered and captured.": "事实上，这并不是运气，至少对于{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}来说不是。Leosin研究了他们之前的袭击，得出结论称现在是邪教团伙袭击更大目标的时机，他知道格林尼斯虽然繁荣但防御薄弱，是最可能的下一个目标。因此，当他认为时机差不多成熟时，他前往小镇，并打算待到发生某些事情。他的观察得到了回报，Leosin在夜间与他的同伴分开，并在袭击者撤退时混入其中，希望了解更多关于邪教团伙计划和他们营地位置的信息。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}在太阳升起后发现了他，这位僧侣很快就被制服并俘虏。",

A successful roll means the character realizes that while quite a bit of material has been left behind, it's all trash: cracked pottery, rusty knives, soiled clothing and bedding, cheap cookware, and wine that's gone to vinegar. Some of it might be of use to the people of Greenest who lost everything in fires, but it has no value as treasure.": "对营地进行彻底搜索大约需要十个工时。允许角色在第一个小时后进行一次智力检定({@skill Perception})。成功的检定意味着角色意识到虽然留下了相当多的材料，但都是垃圾：破裂的陶器、生锈的刀具、脏衣褥、廉价的炊具，以及变成醋的葡萄酒。其中一些可能对在火灾中失去一切的格林尼斯人有用，但它们并没有作为宝藏的价值。",

Standing guard inside the entrance are two {@creature Dragonclaw|HotDQ|dragonclaws} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}). They position themselves about 30 feet inside the cave and stay near the walls and the column, so that while they aren't hidden, they aren't conspicuous, either. Characters who observe the cave from a distance—from the area of the plateau where the steps ascend from level 1 to level 2, for example—spot one of the dragonclaws.": "洞穴的入口宽敞而高，但天花板很快就降低到15英尺的高度。站在入口内的是两个{@creature Dragonclaw|HotDQ|dragonclaws}（见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}）。他们将自己放置在洞穴内约30英尺处，并靠近墙壁和柱子，这样虽然他们没有隐藏起来，但也不显眼。从远处观察洞穴的人——比如从台阶从1级到2级的高原地区——会发现其中一个龙爪。",

The path on the right is flanked by four {@creature Violet Fungus||violet fungi}, while the path on the left is free of these dangerous growths. The violet fungi can be spotted among all the other mushrooms with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check, but only from the base of the steps, not from atop the ledge. Likewise, a careful inspection of the path reveals that only the left trail sees heavy use.": "没有什么能够区分通往随意检查的路径。右边的路径两侧有四个{@creature Violet Fungus||violet fungi}，而左边的路径则没有这些危险的生长物。紫色的真菌可以在所有其他蘑菇中被发现，只要进行一次成功的DC 15智力检定({@skill Nature})，但只能从台阶的底部，而不能从台阶顶部看到。同样，仔细检查路径会发现只有左侧的小径被频繁使用。",
	"Some fungus from area 3 dots this area, but chiefly it is the lair of a colony of bats. Hidden among the bats are ten {@creature Stirge||stirges}. The bats are present only from sunrise to sundown, but the stirges are always here. Normally the stirges prey on the plentiful bats and leave the cave's other residents alone, but not always.": "一些真菌来自3点这个区域，但主要是一群蝙蝠的巢穴。藏在蝙蝠中的有十只{@creature Stirge||stirges}。蝙蝠只在日出到日落时出现，但吸血鬼蚊一直在这里。通常吸血鬼蚊捕食丰富的蝙蝠并且不会干扰洞穴的其他居民，但并非总是。",

If that causes someone to look up, describe how the ceiling is carpeted with bats with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. To avoid startling the bats, characters must proceed very quietly. This requires a successful DC 10 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check. If three or more characters fail the check, the bats are alarmed by the noise, drop from the ceiling, and fly through the cavern in a blinding cloud of flapping and squeaking rodents. The bats present no danger, but their racket drowns out other noise and makes it impossible to see more than 5 feet. It also alerts the stirges, and the opportunistic bloodsuckers attack in the confusion. The stirges gain a +2 bonus to AC in the bat storm.": "角色们注意到地板上有死蝙蝠（被吸血虫杀死的）。如果这引起某人抬头看，描述天花板上有蝙蝠，成功进行一次DC 10感知（{@skill Perception}）检定。为了避免惊动蝙蝠，角色们必须非常小心地前进。这需要成功进行一次DC 10敏捷（{@skill Stealth}）检定。如果有三个或更多角色未通过检定，蝙蝠会被噪音惊动，从天花板上掉落，并在洞穴中飞行，形成一团眩目的扑打和尖叫的啮齿动物。蝙蝠并不构成危险，但它们的喧闹声淹没了其他声音，使人无法看到超过5英尺的距离。这也会警告吸血虫，这些机会主义的吸血者会在混乱中发动攻击。在蝙蝠风暴中，吸血虫的AC获得+2的加值。",
	"A strong, foul smell hangs in the air. Troglodytes that live deeper beneath the ground have made incursions into the cave through narrow crevices (not displayed on the map). If characters give this area a cursory look and then leave, nothing happens here. If they spend time searching, then four {@creature Troglodyte||troglodytes} attack.

Being not quite fully developed, they have only 33 hitpoints each. Spotting these drakes from the ledge requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check; sweeping the pit with a bullseye lantern grants advantage on this check.

If characters enter the pit, either by descending the steps or climbing down the ledge, the drakes attack.": "下方区域阴影深重。目前有三只 {@creature Guard Drake|HotDQ|guard drakes}，它们快要结束训练了。它们还没有完全发育，每只只有33点生命值。要从悬崖上发现这些幼龙，需要进行一次成功的感知检定（DC 15 智慧检定{@skill Perception}）；用准确的灯笼扫过坑穴可以获得此检定的优势。如果角色们带了些生肉到悬崖上，这些幼龙会以为它们要被喂食，然后向光源进发。如果角色们进入坑穴，无论是走下台阶还是爬下悬崖，这些幼龙就会发动攻击。",
	"If the drakes are spotted and attacked by characters on the ledge, they set up a howl that draws six {@creature Kobold||kobolds} and three {@creature Winged Kobold||winged kobolds} from area 8.

It can be spotted with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, or automatically by someone who is systematically tapping the floor ahead with a pole or other tool. Beneath the parchment sheet is a shallow pit (about 2 feet deep) lined with poisoned spikes. Each time a character moves between areas 4 and 7, roll a {@dice d10}. On a roll of 1 or 2, that character's foot has gone through the trap. The character takes {@dice 1d4} piercing damage from the spikes and must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw against poison.

The collapsible ceiling is spotted incidentally with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check.": "一个角色如果在楼梯上积极寻找陷阱，可以通过成功的DC 10感知检定({@skill Perception})发现被设陷的台阶。而成功的DC 15感知检定({@skill Perception})则可以意外地发现可折叠的天花板。",
	"If characters spend 10 minutes or more studying the carvings, they can learn two things. First, black dragons are overrepresented. Almost half the dragons shown appear to be black dragons. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ|Wyrmspeaker Rezmir} favors them over all other types. Second, a detailed search coupled with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check spots that many of the black dragon carvings have holes in their mouths.": "如果角色花费10分钟或更多时间研究这些雕刻，他们可以学到两件事。首先，黑龙的比例过高。显示出来的龙中，几乎一半似乎是黑龙。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ|Wyrmspeaker Rezmir}偏爱它们而不是其他类型的龙。其次，通过一次成功的DC 10感知检定({@skill Perception})，结合详细搜索，可以发现许多黑龙雕刻的嘴里有洞。",

They don't attack as soon as characters come through the gate but wait until the characters have moved into the chamber. The drakes' first priority is to protect the eggs. Their second priority is to get between the intruders and the steps to prevent them from escaping. Unless characters climb down into 10A without using the stairs, they trigger the kobolds' attack before exploring this area.": "在房间的远处或自然柱子后面，蜷缩在阴影中的有两只经过训练的{@creature Guard Drake|HotDQ|guard drakes}，它们负责保护龙蛋。它们不会在角色们通过大门时立即发动攻击，而是等到角色们进入房间后才行动。这些幼龙的第一优先级是保护龙蛋。第二优先级是挡在入侵者和楼梯之间，阻止他们逃跑。除非角色们不使用楼梯而是爬下到10A区域，否则会触发龙人的袭击。",
	"Mixed in among the stalactites near the southeast corner of the room is an unusual {@creature roper} that can speak Common. It doesn't attack the kobolds or guard drakes because the kobolds feed it spoiled meat that the guard drakes won't eat. If attacked, it fights back (and it's very dangerous to 3rd-level characters!). It can reach anywhere in area 10 with its tentacles, and it can also move at speed 10. It is currently full and curious about strangers, however, so it's not averse to talking. Its only real concern is food. If told about the supply of meat in area 6 and brought some as proof, It leaves the characters along while it creeps away to investigate the larder.": "在房间的东南角附近的钟乳石中，掺杂着一个不寻常的生物{@creature roper}，它能说通用语。它不会攻击龙人或守卫德拉克斯，因为龙人喂它守卫德拉克斯不吃的变质肉。如果被攻击，它会反击（对于三级角色来说非常危险！）。它可以用触手触及10区域内的任何地方，移动速度为10。目前它已经吃饱了，对陌生人感到好奇，因此并不排斥交谈。它唯一关心的是食物。如果被告知6区域的肉供应并带来一些作为证据，它会离开角色，悄悄溜走去调查食品储藏室。",

He allows their collars and girths to chafe sores in their hide, skimps on their feed, and whips them when the aching, hungry animals don't pull hard enough or fast enough to suit him. If the characters still have their horses, he admires them and offers to buy one or more to replace the \"useless nags\" he is stuck with.

This herd, however, includes a magnificent stag (use {@creature elk} statistics) that shimmers in the light as if its coat is spun from gold and its antlers plated with platinum. Nearly everyone in the caravan who can handle a bow wants to bring down that beast. Its pelt would be worth a fortune, even if it's not real gold. A few of the more cautious types warn that the creature is clearly a blessed being and that killing it would bring bad luck on the caravan, but no more than two or three people are persuaded. In minutes, the hunt is on, and the deer herd scatters into the nearby forest and through farmers' fields.": "在一个美丽的阳光明媚的下午，一群 {@creature deer} 被发现正在附近的山丘上吃草。旅行者们抓住这样的机会去猎取新鲜的肉来填满食品储藏室。然而，这群中包括一只壮丽的雄鹿（使用 {@creature elk} 的统计数据），在阳光下闪闪发光，仿佛它的外套是由黄金纺织而成，它的鹿角镀有铂金。几乎每个会使用弓箭的队伍成员都想要击倒那只野兽。它的皮毛将价值连城，即使它并非真正的黄金。一些更为谨慎的人警告说，这个生物显然是受祝福的存在，杀死它会给队伍带来厄运，但只有两三个人被说服。几分钟后，狩猎开始了，鹿群四散进入附近的森林和农田。",
	"When the characters search the tumbled ruins, they find no sign of the stag but see a thin person who resembles a wood elf with bright golden skin. The young male is naked and either is wearing an antlered headpiece or has delicate antlers growing from his head. He drops to his knees and beseeches the characters in a dialect of Elvish that is archaic but understandable. He is an elf prince, and the stones around them were once the beautiful castle where he ruled. But he was cursed by the father of the woman he loved to transform into a {@creature golden stag|HotDQ} whenever he steps outside these walls. He has lived with the curse for so long that his kingdom is forgotten, his castle is fallen to ruin, and he no longer remembers his own name. He believes that a wizard somewhere can release him from the curse, but wherever he goes, people try to kill him for his golden coat. If the characters allow him to accompany them and protect him, he will do his best to reward them at the end of the journey. The story is true; several wizards in Waterdeep could remove the curse. The elf cannot pay a reward at the end, but the characters earn 500 XP apiece for believing him and protecting him. That job won't be easy, because people in the caravan find their story ridiculous and look for opportunities to kill the stag.": "当角色们搜寻倒塌的废墟时，他们没有找到鹿的踪迹，但看到了一个瘦削的人，他像一个拥有明亮金色皮肤的木精灵。这位年轻男子赤裸着身体，头戴鹿角头饰或者头上长着精致的鹿角。他跪倒在地，用一种古老但可理解的精灵方言请求角色们的帮助。他是一位精灵王子，他们周围的石头曾经是他统治的美丽城堡。但他被他所爱女子的父亲诅咒，每当他走出这些城墙，就会变成一只{@creature golden stag|HotDQ}。他已经忍受这个诅咒很久了，以至于他的王国被遗忘，他的城堡已经荒废，他甚至不记得自己的名字。他相信某个地方的巫师可以解除他的诅咒，但无论他走到哪里，人们都试图杀他夺取他的金色外衣。如果角色们允许他加入并保护他，他会尽力在旅程结束时报答他们。这个故事是真实的；在瓦特德普有几位巫师可以解除这个诅咒。这位精灵无法在旅程结束时支付报酬，但角色们每人因相信他并保护他而获得500点经验值。这项任务不会轻松，因为商队中的人们认为他们的故事荒谬，并寻找机会杀死这只鹿。",

	"When the caravan reaches its stopping point for the night, two buxom twin sisters are there ahead of them, setting up camp and tending to their horses. Arietta and Zelina Innevar take a liking to some of the travelers—possibly, but not necessarily, a few of the characters—and spend the evening asking about their past, where they're headed, whether they have family, and so on. The sisters are actually two {@creature Doppelganger||doppelgangers}. They can either attack someone that night or join the caravan for a few days while they study the travelers and choose their victims. When the time comes to strike, they wait until after dark, then try to lure their target away from other people by calling for assistance in a familiar voice. Fortunately for the characters and their fellow travelers, if one is defeated, the other one flees in a flurry of curses and vengeful threats.": "当队伍到达当晚的营地时，两位丰满的双胞胎姐妹已经在那里，正在搭起帐篷并照看他们的马匹。Arietta和Zelina Innevar对一些旅行者产生了好感——可能是一些角色，也可能不是——并在晚上询问他们的过去、目的地、是否有家人等等。这两位姐妹实际上是两位{@creature Doppelganger||doppelgangers}。她们可以选择在那个晚上袭击某人，或者加入队伍几天，观察旅行者并选择他们的受害者。当袭击时机到来时，她们会等到天黑后，然后试图用熟悉的声音呼唤目标，试图将其引开。幸运的是，对于角色和其他旅行者来说，如果其中一人被打败，另一个会在一阵咒骂和复仇威胁中逃走。",

When the caravan is passing through one such wooded region, three {@creature Ettercap||ettercaps} and two {@creature Giant Spider||giant spiders} attack it. They are chiefly interested in taking horses, not merchandise, but they won't balk at taking people if they can't get horses. Two ettercaps go after horses while the third ettercap and the giant spiders keep the caravan guards busy. An ettercap can cut a horse free from its harness in 3 rounds. After that, they retreat into the trees, leading the horse away with reins of webbing. Without horses, the wagons are stranded. The characters' employer insists they go after the ettercaps and retrieve the stolen horses.": "贸易之路绕过巨大的巨魔树皮森林和迷雾森林之间，但它穿过许多其他在地图上看不到的较小森林。当商队穿越这样一个树木茂密的地区时，三{@creature Ettercap||ettercaps}和两{@creature Giant Spider||giant spiders}袭击了它。它们主要是想抢马，而不是货物，但如果得不到马，它们也不会犹豫抓人。两只蛛魔追赶马匹，而第三只蛛魔和巨型蜘蛛让商队护卫忙个不停。一只蛛魔可以在3回合内将马从挽具中解放出来。之后，它们会撤退到树林中，用蛛网缰绳牵着马走。没有了马，货车就被困住了。人物的雇主坚持让他们追捕蛛魔并取回被偷的马匹。",
	"If the characters move quickly, they have a good chance to retrieve the horses alive. The animals leave a trail through the underbrush that's easy to follow; a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check is sufficient to keep on it. The horses are led away about half a mile to the ettercaps' lair. If characters charge straight in, they are attacked by three {@creature Ettercap||ettercaps} and two {@creature Giant Spider||giant spiders}. If they pause to observe for a few minutes, they see the ettercaps shoo the giant spiders away while they prepare for their feast of horse meat. The characters can then fight just the ettercaps for 6 rounds, before the spiders return to the sound of battle. The characters can't delay for long, however, because the ettercaps won't waste much time before killing and tucking into the horses.": "如果角色移动迅速，他们有很好的机会活着找回马匹。动物在灌木丛中留下了易于跟踪的痕迹；成功的DC 10感知检定足以继续跟踪。马匹被带到大约半英里外的{@creature Ettercap||ettercaps}巢穴。如果角色直接冲进去，他们会被三只{@creature Ettercap||ettercaps}和两只{@creature Giant Spider||giant spiders}袭击。如果他们停下来观察几分钟，他们会看到{@creature Ettercap||ettercaps}赶走巨蜘蛛，准备享用马肉盛宴。角色可以与{@creature Ettercap||ettercaps}战斗6回合，然后巨蜘蛛回来参与战斗。然而，角色不能拖延太久，因为{@creature Ettercap||ettercaps}不会浪费时间，在杀死马匹后很快就会开始进食。",

	"Gleamsilver is especially cagey about why she's interested in all this. The gnome never mentions the Zhentarim or the Black Network. She never comes out and says she works for the Harpers, either. Gleamsilver is an expert at picking up on the subtlest clues and using them to seem to know things she doesn't actually know and to say what people want or expect to hear. She uses that talent to great advantage against the characters in all their dealings. If players ask to use Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) to detect whether the gnome is telling the truth, let them make the check. On a roll of 15 or higher, the character suspects Gleamsilver isn't telling them everything but doesn't discern an actual lie. On any other result, the characters detect no dishonesty.": "Gleamsilver对于她为什么对这一切感兴趣特别谨慎。这位侏儒从不提及Zhentarim或黑色网络。她也从不直接说自己为哈珀人工作。Gleamsilver擅长捕捉最微妙的线索，并利用它们似乎知道她实际上不知道的事情，并说出人们想要或期望听到的话。她利用这种才能在与角色的所有交易中占据了极大的优势。如果玩家要求使用感知力（{@skill Insight}）来检测侏儒是否在说真话，让他们进行检定。在掷骰结果为15或更高时，角色会怀疑Gleamsilver没有告诉他们一切，但并未察觉到实际的谎言。在其他任何结果中，角色都没有发现任何虚假。",
	"The dead man's companions immediately accuse one of the characters and demand to inspect the characters' weapons. If the character carries a shortsword, it will be a match, although that proves nothing. Any sword that size would be close enough.

The ground was swept during the night to remove prints.": "死者的同伴立即指责其中一名角色，并要求检查角色的武器。如果角色携带一把短剑，那么它会匹配，尽管这并不能证明什么。那个尺寸的任何剑都足够接近。车边有许多脚印，但成功的 DC 10 智力检定（{@skill Investigation}）可以确定它们都是早上围着尸体的人留下的。地面在夜间被清扫过，以消除脚印。",

When cult wagons arrive, their road-building cargo is unloaded into the compound normally, but Bog Luck ensures that the contraband is stored in the strong room.

At night, when everyone in the compound is asleep except for a few rooftop guards, lizardfolk creep through the tunnel and take the marked crates to a location in the mere (the subject of {@adventure chapter 6|HotDQ|6}). They seldom perform this task over a single night unless the shipment is very small. Typically they take one night per wagon.": "在保险库房的地板上有一个伪装的活板门。可以通过一次DC 10的感知检定({@skill Perception})找到它。这个活板门通往一个滴水、黏糊糊的隧道，长达500码，通往死人沼泽边上一片茂密的树丛和灌木丛。在夜晚，除了几名屋顶守卫外，营地里的所有人都已经入睡，蜥蜴人会悄悄地穿过隧道，将标记的货箱运到沼泽中的某个地点（{@adventure chapter 6|HotDQ|6}的主题）。他们很少在一夜之间完成这项任务，除非货物非常少。通常他们每辆货车需要一个晚上。",

After the structure sat abandoned for years, a group of astrologers called the Academy of Stargazers claimed it. They built an observatory into the top level of the keep, where they installed a piece of magic equipment called the {@i farseer of Illusk}. But the astrologers vanished mysteriously after a few years.": "一个多世纪前，一位半精灵巫师在死人沼泽的边缘建造了一座城堡。在那里生活了一段相对较短的时间后，不断蔓延的沼泽使得这个地点对他来说太过偏远。在这座建筑多年被遗弃后，一群被称为星观者学院的占星者接管了它。他们在堡垒的顶层建造了一个天文台，在那里安装了一件名为{@i farseer of Illusk}的魔法装备。但几年后，这些占星者神秘消失了。",
	"Only a handful of true Cult of the Dragon initiates and officers resides at the castle. All of them are noted in the castle description. They act as overseers and aides to Borngray and {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}.": "在城堡中只有少数真正的龙之邪教倡导者和官员。 他们都在城堡描述中有提及。 他们充当Borngray和{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}的监督者和助手。",
	"The number of bullywugs around the castle fluctuates. They come and go as they please. On any given day, forty to fifty are camped outside the castle. Thirty-four more plus Pharblex live in the castle barracks (areas {@area 1G|14b|x} and {@area 2G|164|x}). Another thirty to seventy are in the immediate area, close enough to respond within fifteen minutes to the beating of the drum in the barbican.": "在城堡周围的半人半蛙数量不断变化。它们随心所欲地来来去去。在任何一天，有四十到五十只半人半蛙露宿在城堡外。另外三十四只加上法布莱克斯生活在城堡的兵营（区域{@area 1G|14b|x}和{@area 2G|164|x}）。另外三十到七十只在附近地区，足够靠近，在十五分钟内就能响应护城鼓的敲击。",
	"Like the bullywugs, the lizardfolk's first assumption on seeing strangers is that they are cultists, or allies of the cultists, come to work or parley at the castle. They don't share the bullywugs' arrogance, however, so unless they are attacked, they don't really care who wanders through the camp. Lizardfolk on patrol or standing guard are an exception. They are alert, and they assume everyone is a potential enemy. They won't attack until they know for sure, lest they incur the wrath of {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} or Borngray for killing an ally. As outlying guards, their instructions are to alert the camp when strangers approach, keep the strangers under observation, and await further instructions.": "和蛙人一样，蜥蜴人在看到陌生人时首先的假设是他们是异教徒，或者是异教徒的盟友，前来工作或者在城堡会谈。然而，他们并不像蛙人那样傲慢，所以除非受到攻击，他们并不在乎谁在营地里闲逛。巡逻或站岗的蜥蜴人是个例外。他们警惕，假设每个人都是潜在的敌人。除非确定，他们不会发动攻击，以免招致{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}或Borngray的愤怒，因为误杀了盟友。作为外围警卫，他们的指令是在陌生人靠近时警告营地，观察陌生人，并等待进一步指示。",
	"Voaraghamanthar has a secret that is known to only two other creatures in Faerûn. One of them is {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}. The other creature {@i is} the secret: Waervaerendor, the twin brother of Voaraghamanthar. For centuries, these twins have misled the world into believing that only one dragon dwells in the Mere of Dead Men—one dragon that must travel at immense speed, since it has been spotted at widely separated locales in rapid succession. The siblings seldom leave their lairs, but when they do, they coordinate so they are never seen together or seen in two distant places at precisely the same time.": "沃拉加曼萨有一个只有另外两个生物在费伦知道的秘密。 其中一个是{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}。 另一个生物{@i is}知道这个秘密：沃拉加曼萨的孪生兄弟瓦尔瓦伦多。 几个世纪以来，这对孪生兄弟一直让世人误以为死人沼泽中只有一只龙——一只必须以极快的速度行进的龙，因为它已经被相继出现在远离的地点。 这对兄弟很少离开它们的巢穴，但当它们离开时，它们会协调好，以便从不同时被看到，或者在完全相同的时间出现在两个遥远的地方。",
	"Characters should not encounter either of these dragons face to face in this adventure (they are likely to meet in {@i The Rise of Tiamat}). If characters stray from the lizardfolk's path between the work camp and Castle Naerytar, intentionally or unintentionally—if, for example, they follow will-o'-wisps into the mere—they could enter the blighted territory around one of the lairs. Many clues can inform characters that they're in dragon territory. First, they pass markers consisting of the acid-eaten skulls of humans, humanoids, yuan-ti, crocodiles, and just about every other creature that lives in the mere. The skulls hang from withered trees and from spikes driven into the ground.": "在这次冒险中，角色不应该与这两只龙面对面相遇（它们可能会在{@i The Rise of Tiamat}相遇）。如果角色偏离了蜥蜴人从工作营地到奈瑞塔城堡的路线，无论是故意还是无意间——例如，他们跟随鬼火进入湖泊，他们可能会进入其中一座巢穴周围的荒芜领地。许多线索可以告诉角色他们处于龙的领地。首先，他们经过由人类、类人生物、蛇人、鳄鱼以及几乎每种生活在湖泊中的生物的被酸蚀的头骨组成的标记。这些头骨挂在枯萎的树上和钉在地面上的尖桩上。",
	"Eight {@creature Giant Frog||giant frogs} hop randomly among the huts or sit silently in the pools of standing water. These creatures were raised from tadpoles by the bullywugs and don't bother them, but they attack anyone else who carelessly wanders within reach of their 15-foot-long tongues.": "八只{@creature Giant Frog||giant frogs}随意地在小屋之间跳跃，或者静静地坐在积水中。这些生物是从蝌蚪中长大的，由半蛙人抚养，它们不会打扰半蛙人，但会攻击任何不小心靠近它们、在它们15英尺长的舌头范围内徘徊的人。",
	"The muddy water lapping against the castle walls is indistinguishable at a glance from the puddles and hip-deep water standing throughout the area, but it hides a moat. Portions of the moat around the southwest tower have filled in to ground level, but elsewhere it is 30 to 40 feet wide and up to 15 feet deep. The causeway (1A) arches over the moat, providing a visual clue that the water may be deeper than it appears. Anyone splashing around in the moat attracts the attention of six {@creature Crocodile||crocodiles}.": "泥水拍打着城堡墙壁，一眼看去与周围的水坑和深及腰部的积水无法区分，但它隐藏着一道护城河。西南塔楼周围的护城河部分已经填满至地面水平，但其他地方宽30至40英尺，深达15英尺。通道(1A)拱桥横跨护城河，提供了一个视觉线索，表明水可能比看起来更深。任何在护城河中溅水的人都会引起六{@creature Crocodile||crocodiles}的注意。",
	"This is the only entrance into the castle that's used. When the castle was built, a pair of stout wooden gates and an iron portcullis closed off this 12-foot-wide, 10-foot-high gateway. The gates are never closed; they now sag on their hinges so badly that it's not worth the effort of levering them into place for any reason short of an imminent attack. The portcullis is rigged so it can be dropped with a hard yank on a lever (located on the upper level, {@area area 2A|160|x}), but since it was last tested, the mechanism has rusted to the point where the gate will drop only 3 feet, then jam in place.": "这是唯一使用的进入{@area area 2A|160|x}城堡的入口。当城堡建造时，一对坚固的木门和一道铁闸门关闭了这个12英尺宽、10英尺高的门户。这些门从未关闭过；它们现在在铰链上下垂得如此严重，以至于除非有迫在眉睫的攻击，否则不值得费力将它们推到位。铁闸门的机制设计成可以通过在上层的一个杠杆上用力一拉就能关闭，但自从上次测试以来，机制已生锈到只能下降3英尺，然后卡住无法移动。",
	"The barbican is the primary defensive position for the castle. It is guarded round-the-clock by ten {@creature Bullywug||bullywugs} and {@dice 1d6} {@creature Giant Frog||giant frogs}. Unless a fight or other disturbance has happened somewhere, these guards are at low alertness.": "角楼是城堡的主要防御位置。它由十名{@creature Bullywug||bullywugs}和{@dice 1d6}{@creature Giant Frog||giant frogs}守卫全天候。除非发生了战斗或其他骚乱，这些守卫通常警惕性较低。",
	"Sloppy mud covers the stone floor of this large chamber. Planks have been laid from the gateway to the causeway entrance to create a 10-foot-wide raised boardwalk for the cultists, who don't enjoy walking through mud the way bullywugs do. The slippery mud makes everywhere off the planks {@quickref difficult terrain||3} for characters. A few tables have been thrown together from planks laid across barrels, with crudely made benches for seats. The tables and benches are nearly as muddy as the floor.": "这个宽敞的大房间地面上覆盖着泥泞。从门户到通道入口处铺设了木板，形成了一个10英尺宽的高起的木栈道，供那些狂热信徒走路时不像蛙人那样不喜欢走在泥泞中的人使用。滑溜的泥泞使得除了木板以外的任何地方都对角色来说是{@quickref difficult terrain||3}。几张桌子是用木板搭在桶上拼凑而成的，旁边有粗制的长凳供人坐。桌子和长凳几乎和地板一样泥泞。",
	"Stairs lead up to {@area area 2A|160|x}.": "楼梯通往{@area area 2A|160|x}。",
	"The ground here was once hard-packed earth, but the area in front of the barracks ({@area area 1G|14b|x}) has been churned into mud by flapping bullywug feet. At any particular time, there are {@dice 1d6}–1 {@creature Bullywug||bullywugs} and {@dice 1d6}–1 {@creature lizardfolk} present in the outer ward. Lizardfolk are likely to be working (training their giant lizards), while bullywugs might be loafing or giving orders to the lizardfolk.": "这里的地面曾经是硬实的土地，但兵营前面的区域已经被呱呱蛙的脚蹬成了泥泞。在任何特定时间，外围区域可能有{@dice 1d6} - 1只{@creature Bullywug||bullywugs}和{@dice 1d6} - 1只{@creature lizardfolk}。蜥蜴人可能正在工作（训练他们的巨蜥），而呱呱蛙可能正在闲逛或向蜥蜴人下达命令。",
	"The pit is home to an {@creature otyugh} that consumes much of the castle's garbage. When characters arrive, it is sitting quietly submerged in the muck, making it undetectable unless characters stir the foul-smelling stuff with poles. If someone steps into the muck or leaps to the steps, the otyugh lashes out with its tentacles. A {@condition grappled} character is dragged into the pit where, along with all the hazards of being savaged by an otyugh, there is the added danger of drowning. It's safe to assume that characters entering this tower will take a big gulp of clean air first, but the otyugh's attack might knock the wind out of them. Allow the attacked character to make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 5 plus the damage caused by the otyugh's tentacle attack. A successful saving throw means the character has a lungful of air when dragged into the muck and can hold his or her breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + his or her Constitution modifier, with a minimum of 30 seconds (5 rounds). Failure means the character's lungs are empty, and the character falls {@condition unconscious} at the end of his or her turn after a number of rounds equal to the character's Constitution modifier unless the character breaks free from the otyugh's grasp before then. See the {@book suffocating rules|PHB|8|Suffocating} in the {@i Player's Handbook}.": "这个坑是一个{@creature otyugh}的家，它消耗了城堡大部分的垃圾。当角色们到达时，它静静地坐在泥泞中，除非角色们用棍子搅动那些恶臭的东西，否则它是不可察觉的。如果有人踏入泥泞或跳到台阶上，{@condition grappled}角色会被它的触手拖入坑中，在那里，除了被{@condition unconscious}折磨的危险外，还有淹死的危险。可以肯定的是，进入这座塔的角色们会先深呼吸一口干净的空气，但是{@creature otyugh}的攻击可能会让他们窒息。允许被攻击的角色进行一次体质豁免检定，豁免 DC 值等于 5 加上{@creature otyugh}的触手攻击造成的伤害。豁免成功意味着角色在被拖入泥泞时还有一口气，并且可以屏住呼吸的时间等于 1 + 他或她的体质调整值，最少为 30 秒（5 回合）。失败意味着角色的肺部是空的，角色会在一定回合数后（回合数等于角色的体质调整值）窒息，除非角色在那之前挣脱{@creature otyugh}的控制。参见{@i Player's Handbook}中的{@book suffocating rules|PHB|8|Suffocating}。",
	"Buried among all the copper and tin in one chest is a small mahogany box containing two {@item Potion of Healing||potions of healing} and one vial of {@item oil of etherealness}, overlooked by the cultists during sorting.": "在一个箱子里，藏着大量的铜和锡，还有一个小红木盒，里面装着两个{@item Potion of Healing||potions of healing}和一个小瓶{@item oil of etherealness}，在整理时被邪教徒忽略了。",
	"The ten dominant lizardfolk guards rest in this chamber, because it gets more warmth from the forge (area 1H) than area 1K does.

It is empty during the day, but ten {@creature lizardfolk} sleep here at night.": "这个房间里有十名占主导地位的蜥蜴人守卫休息，因为这个房间比1K区域更接近锻造炉（1H区域），所以更暖和。他们睡在铺在地板上没有明显规律的芦苇垫上，每个人在“床”下面放着些微薄的个人物品。尽管没有秩序，房间很干净和干燥。白天空无一人，但晚上有十名{@creature lizardfolk}在这里睡觉。",
	"Ten lizardfolk guards sleep in this chamber. They are the less dominant half of Borngray's lizardfolk guards, consigned to this sleeping chamber because it gets less warmth from the forge (area 1H) than area 1J does.

It is empty during the day, but ten {@creature lizardfolk} sleep here at night.": "这个房间里有十个蜥蜴人守卫在睡觉。他们是Borngray的蜥蜴人守卫中地位较低的一半，被安排在这个睡眠室，因为这里从锻造炉（区域1H）得到的温暖比1J区域少。他们睡在铺在地板上的芦苇垫上，没有明显的摆放顺序，每个人在“床”下面放着些微薄的财物。尽管缺乏秩序，房间很干净和干燥。白天空无一人，但晚上有十个{@creature lizardfolk}在这里睡觉。",
	"A hidden compartment beneath Tiamat's black dragon head contains a {@item dagger of venom}. It can be found with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

	"The southwest corner of the room is a makeshift carpentry shop, where cultists build new chests and boxes to hold the plunder. If characters have a chance to paw through the piles and keep what they find, they get 450 gp, 520 sp, 80 pp, 22 semiprecious stones (5 × 35 gp, 6 × 45 gp, 6 × 55 gp, 4 × 65 gp, 1 × 80 gp), and a {@item potion of greater healing}. Alternatively, you can create your own expert-level hoard.": "房间的西南角是一个临时木工店，邪教徒在那里制作新的箱子和箱子来装载战利品。如果角色有机会翻找这些堆积物并留下他们发现的东西，他们会得到450 gp，520 sp，80 pp，22颗半宝石（5 × 35 gp，6 × 45 gp，6 × 55 gp，4 × 65 gp，1 × 80 gp），以及一个{@item potion of greater healing}。或者，你可以创建你自己的专家级战利品。",
	"This chamber is wet and moldy, though not flooded. The cultists don't use it because of the dampness, so giant centipedes have moved in and made a nest. Anyone who enters the chamber becomes the target of ten {@creature Giant Centipede||giant centipedes}.": "这个房间又湿又发霉，虽然没有被淹没。邪教徒不使用它是因为潮湿，所以巨型蜈蚣搬进来并建立了一个巢穴。任何进入这个房间的人都会成为十只{@creature Giant Centipede||giant centipedes}的目标。",

Jos will be here when he isn't consulting with {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} in area 1U, {@area 2N|16a|x}, or {@area 3L|176|x}. Jos keeps all of his real valuables with him. The only things he leaves in these chambers are his clothes and his traveling spellbook—which contains all the spells he has prepared (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}). The spellbook is locked inside a box of silver-inlaid redwood. The lock can be opened with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, but if the roll is less than 20, the tampering sets off a magical ward with the same effect as a {@spell Melf's acid arrow} spell; the acid arrow launches at the character who opened the box and causes {@dice 4d6} acid damage immediately plus another {@dice 4d6} acid damage at the end of the character's next turn. The damage is halved if the character makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Opening the box with the key disarms the trap automatically; Jos carries the key on a string around his neck.": "通常这些房间不被使用，但目前被{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}占用。这些房间相当温暖舒适。Jos在不与{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}在1U区域、{@area 2N|16a|x}或{@area 3L|176|x}商议时会在这里。Jos将他所有真正贵重的物品都随身携带。他在这些房间里留下的只有他的衣服和旅行咒书—里面包含他准备好的所有咒语(见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12})。这本咒书锁在一只银镶红木盒子里。锁可以通过成功的DC 15敏捷检定打开，但如果点数小于20，篡改会触发一个与{@spell Melf's acid arrow}咒语效果相同的魔法警报；酸箭会射向打开盒子的角色，立即造成{@dice 4d6}点酸性伤害，然后在角色的下一个回合结束时再造成{@dice 4d6}点酸性伤害。如果角色进行成功的DC 15敏捷豁免检定，伤害减半。使用钥匙打开盒子会自动解除陷阱；Jos将钥匙挂在脖子上的绳子上。",
	"Although it is much cleaner than the lower level, the upper level of the barbican is still a mess. Muddy, webbed footprints of bullywugs trail up and down the stairs and fan out across the floor.

	"The arsenal chamber is the warmest in the castle, thanks to heat rising from the forge ({@area area 1H|14d|x}). The lizardfolk that live in the castle gather here—usually at night—to discuss their situation and what they should do. The debate is between accepting their fate as lowly servants of the Cult of the Dragon, attacking the bullywugs in a glorious yet suicidal assault, or biding their time until they can attack with a chance of winning.": "兵工室是城堡里最温暖的地方，这要归功于从锻造炉中升起的热气({@area area 1H|14d|x})。居住在城堡里的蜥蜴人通常在这里聚集——通常是在夜晚——讨论他们的处境以及他们应该做什么。辩论的焦点是接受他们作为龙之邪教的卑贱仆人的命运，发动一场光荣但自杀性的进攻来攻击蛤蟆人，或者耐心等待时机，直到他们有机会取胜。",
	"If characters poke around in this area, however, those with a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 15 or higher notice that the doors between areas 2H, 2I, and 2K open and close smoothly and soundlessly, unlike most other doors in the castle, which squeak and squeal loudly on corroded hinges. The lizardfolk keep these doors well-oiled so they can slip up to area 2H in the dead of night without awakening any bullywugs in the barracks (areas {@area 1G|14b|x} and {@area 2G|164|x}).": "如果角色在这个区域四处探索，然而，那些被动感知力得分为15或更高的角色会注意到2H、2I和2K之间的门可以平稳无声地打开和关闭，与城堡中大多数其他门相比，这些门会在生锈的铰链上发出尖叫声和吱吱声。蜥蜴人保持这些门润滑，这样他们就可以在深夜悄无声息地溜到2H区域，而不会惊醒宿舍中的任何蛤蟆人（区域{@area 1G|14b|x}和{@area 2G|164|x}）。",
	"A trapdoor closes off the top of the stairs up to {@area area 3H|175|x}. The trapdoor isn't locked, but a pair of iron spikes has been hammered between the door and the frame.

	"The dim-witted ogre stewards are poor conversationalists, but {@creature Blagothkus|HotDQ} uses them as sounding boards, expressing his concerns that the Cult of the Dragon might try to seize control of the castle.
