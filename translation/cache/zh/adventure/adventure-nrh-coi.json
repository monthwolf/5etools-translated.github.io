	"Ever jealous of the cheery dispositions and colorful deliciousness of the NERDS, Emo the beholder and his hired muscle, Mr. Greystone, have struck a blow against the NERDS' beloved city of Harmony. After years of searching, the nefarious duo have found the sacred Prismatic Well that gives Harmony its vibrant and fabulous colors. Now, with access to the Prismatic Well, Emo and Mr. Greystone have begun to leech the color from the city of Harmony. If they aren't stopped, the city will gradually turn gray, with everything eventually becoming black and white.": "Emo和他的雇佣兵Greystone先生一直嫉妒NERDS的快乐性格和多彩的美味，他们对NERDS所热爱的城市Harmony进行了打击。经过多年的搜寻，这对邪恶的二人组已经找到了神圣的棱镜井，它赋予了和谐城鲜艳而美妙的色彩。现在，有了进入棱镜井的机会，埃莫和格雷斯通先生开始从和谐城中吸取颜色。如果不阻止他们，这个城市将逐渐变成灰色，所有东西最终都会变成黑色和白色。",

	"But one group knows what's up, and that group is the Lorekeeper Society—a secret society sworn to protect Harmony. The Lorekeepers know about the power of the Prismatic Well, but its true location is lost even to themselves. However, they have a way to find the well using an ancient artifact known as the Amulet of Harmony, but to activate it they need to find the six Gems of Power. Once activated, the amulet guides whoever controls it to the secret location of the Prismatic Well. But once activated, the amulet also has the power to turn off the well.": "但有一个团体知道这是怎么回事，这个团体就是传说守护者协会--一个发誓要保护和谐的秘密团体。守望者协会知道棱镜井的力量，但它的真实位置连他们自己都不知道。然而，他们有办法通过一个被称为 \"和谐护身符 \"的古老神器来找到这口井，但要激活它，他们需要找到六颗力量宝石。一旦激活，护身符会引导控制它的人到达棱镜井的秘密地点。但一旦激活，护身符也有能力关闭水井。",

No one in the Lorekeeper Society knows the details of the magical beasts and traps guarding the gems, but our heroic NERDS are more than up to the challenge of restoring Harmony!": "力量宝石很久以前就被藏在地牢、森林和塔楼里保管起来了。守望者协会中没有人知道守护宝石的魔兽和陷阱的细节，但我们英勇的NERDS足以应对恢复和谐的挑战!",
	"Due to the solo player nature of the adventures (with the exception of Adventure 7 Adventure Together), the power level of some monsters may be difficult with respect to the level of the character.

	"Whenever you're both ready, you can start the session.": "每当你们都准备好了，你们就可以开始治疗了。",
	"The adventure begins in the vibrant and colorful city of Harmony where mysterious \"color outages\" are beginning to cause a bit of alarm. Being NERDS, the populace of Harmony has an optimistic outlook, and tries to carry on as best they can without being too worried, but the lack of color is concerning to even the most ebullient of NERDS.": "冒险开始于充满活力和色彩斑斓的和谐市，在那里，神秘的 \"颜色中断 \"开始引起了一些恐慌。作为NERDS，Harmony的居民有一个乐观的前景，并试图在不太担心的情况下尽可能地继续下去，但色彩的缺乏甚至让最热情的NERDS也感到担忧。",

	"Recently, however, a strange phenomenon has shaken the citizens of Harmony.

	"The nervous man introduces himself as {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} and says to Green that he needs their help in a matter of utmost importance. If Green is willing to hear Mr. Honeycutt out, he tells Green that he's the current Magister of the Lorekeeper Society—an ancient and secret group dedicated to the defense of Harmony. He believes he knows how to solve the mystery of the color outages and to do this, he needs to recover the Emerald Gem. He believes this gemstone is in the possession of a thief who's somewhere in the Circus of Illusions, an entertainment mainstay of Harmony. Mr. Honeycutt says a bard of Green's talent and charm could easily infiltrate the circus as a performer. If Green is amenable, Mr. Honeycutt gives Green a {@item potion of healing} and whispers \"Watch out for the clowns.\" He awaits Green's return in the tavern.": "这个紧张的男人自我介绍说他是{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}，并对格林说他需要他们的帮助来处理一件最重要的事情。如果Green愿意听Honeycutt先生说完，他告诉Green，他是Lorekeeper协会--一个致力于捍卫和谐的古老而秘密的团体--的现任教官。他相信他知道如何解决颜色中断之谜，要做到这一点，他需要恢复翡翠宝石。他认为这颗宝石在一个小偷手里，而这个小偷就在和谐城的娱乐主力--幻觉马戏团的某个地方。哈尼卡特先生说，像格林这样有天赋和魅力的吟游诗人可以很容易地以表演者的身份渗透到马戏团中。如果格林同意，霍尼卡特先生给了格林一个{@item potion of healing}，并低声说 \"小心小丑\"。他在酒馆里等待着格林的归来。",

	"Green can choose to pay 1 sp and enter by the main gate or to sneak in. The circus is patrolled by tough-looking clowns wearing colorful costumes, big boots, and red noses. Although the clowns honk horns and act jolly, it's clear they could handle themselves in a fight.": "绿色可以选择支付1英镑，从正门进入，也可以选择偷偷摸摸进入。马戏团由身着五颜六色的服装、穿着大靴子和红鼻子、看起来很强硬的小丑巡逻。虽然这些小丑按着喇叭，表现得很高兴，但很明显他们在战斗中也能应付自如。",

	"You can act out the mime's silent message and have your player guess what the mime is saying. The mime remains stone-faced throughout unless they need to make an exaggerated expression of sadness or another emotion. If you player gets frustrated trying to guess, have the mime shrug, mime sad tears running down their face, and walk away dejectedly.": "你可以把哑剧的无声信息表演出来，让你的玩家猜测哑剧在说什么。除非他们需要夸张地表现出悲伤或其他情绪，否则哑剧始终保持面无表情。如果你的玩家在猜测时感到沮丧，可以让哑剧演员耸耸肩，模仿悲伤的泪水流下，然后沮丧地走开。",

	"Green attempts the performance of a lifetime with a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Performance}) check. If your player does some inspired roleplaying, they have advantage on the check, or you could even allow them to succeed outright. On a failure, there are audible groans from the crowd and Rubina manages to crack a supportive smile, but looks crestfallen. On a success, minds are blown, the crowd goes wild, and there are calls for encores. After the show, signatures are demanded. From now on, Green is a celebrity in the city of Harmony. At the end of all the hubbub, Rubina approaches Green with tears in her eyes and gives Green a doss lute. There's an audible gasp from the crowd. \"It was sublime. A gift that has lifted my spirits forever,\" Rubina says.": "格林试图用DC15魅力（{@skill Performance}）检查来完成一生的表演。如果你的玩家做了一些有灵感的角色扮演，他们在检定上有优势，或者你甚至可以让他们直接成功。如果失败了，人群中会出现明显的呻吟声，鲁比娜勉强挤出一个支持性的微笑，但看起来很沮丧。如果成功了，人们的思想就会被炸开，人群就会变得疯狂，并呼吁进行安可演出。演出结束后，人们要求签名。从现在开始，格林是和谐市的名人。在所有的喧嚣结束时，鲁比娜眼含泪水地走到格林面前，送给格林一把多斯琵琶。人群中传来一阵阵惊叹声。\"那是崇高的。鲁比娜说：\"这是一份让我的精神永远振奋的礼物。",

	"Woody's circular face is painted with a big smile, but if anyone tries to get past without paying or causes trouble, the face turns upside down, becoming a big frown and Woody starts calling for clowns to boot the offender. Woody can't fight and, if attacked, is easily reduced to a pile of sticks.": "伍迪的圆脸上画着灿烂的笑容，但如果有人想不付钱就过去，或者惹是生非，那张脸就会颠倒过来，变成一个大大的皱眉头，伍迪开始呼唤小丑来引导违法者。伍迪不会打架，如果受到攻击，很容易变成一堆棍子。",

	"Finster spends most of their time in {@creature Magnifico|NRH-CoI}'s tent, in rat form, primping their whiskers and waiting for their nightly show just before midnight.

	"In solo play, there's always a chance the character can die. In the case of a single adventurer, this death results in the end of play; which isn't optimal for an afternoon of fun! One way to avoid death is to have healing readily available to the adventurer. If they're without healing, have the character find the odd {@item potion of healing} lying in a dusty crate or have them discover a special healing plant on their journey that, if eaten, puts them back to full hit points.": "在独自冒险中，角色总是有可能会死亡。对于单个冒险者，这种死亡会导致游戏的结束；这对于一个下午的娱乐并不理想！避免死亡的一种方法是让冒险者随时获得治疗。如果他们没有治疗，可以让角色在一只灰尘飘扬的箱子中发现一个奇怪的{@item potion of healing}，或者让他们在旅途中发现一种特殊的治疗植物，如果食用，可以让他们的生命值恢复到满值。",
	"Should anyone try to break into the circus or cause trouble, they run afoul of a couple of these clowns. Avoiding the clowns requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check. On a failure, {@dice 1d4} {@creature clown|NRH-CoI|clowns} investigate, ready to pummel and eject any trespassers or ne'er-do-wells. If Green turns to run away, the clowns don't give chase, but shout taunts and honk horns at them.": "如果有人试图闯入马戏团或制造麻烦，他们将惹恼其中几个小丑。要避开这些小丑，需要成功通过一次 DC 12 的敏捷度检定({@skill Stealth})。如果失败，{@dice 1d4} {@creature clown|NRH-CoI|clowns} 将进行调查，准备殴打并驱逐任何闯入者或恶棍。如果绿色转身逃跑，小丑们不会追赶，但会向他们大喊侮辱性言语并按喇叭。",

	"If Finster feels they can use the Emerald Gem to advance their career or make another deal, they do.

If attacked, Finster shrieks to alert any nearby clowns and turns {@condition invisible}.": "如果芬斯特（Finster）觉得他们可以利用翡翠宝石来促进自己的事业或达成另一笔交易，他们会这样做。芬斯特对{@creature Magnifico|NRH-CoI}没有忠诚度，除了利用他来谋取自己的利益。如果受到攻击，芬斯特会尖叫以警示附近的小丑并变身为{@condition invisible}。",

	"Green plays it safe and gives a solid, but uninspired, performance. If your player does some inspired roleplaying, give them advantage on the check. Green must make a DC 12 Charisma ({@skill Performance}) check. On a failure, there are some frowning faces and maybe a couple of yawns. Clearly, they weren't expecting much. On a success, the crowd claps politely and then quickly forgets the performance as they wait for the next show.": "绿色玩得很安全，表现稳健，但缺乏灵感。如果你的玩家进行了一些富有灵感的角色扮演，请给予他们在检定时的优势。绿色必须进行一次 DC 12 魅力 ({@skill Performance}) 检定。如果失败，会有一些皱眉和也许几个打哈欠的人。显然，他们并没有期待太多。如果成功，观众会礼貌地鼓掌，然后迅速忘记表演，等待下一场演出。",
	"If Rubina (a {@creature noble}) is here, she's looking over the upcoming schedule of events for tonight and the next couple of days. There's a desk, two wooden chairs, a small table, and a sofa.
