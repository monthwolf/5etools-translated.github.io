Before long, the adventurers will be embroiled in the action. (Or, instead of spying for the Lords of Waterdeep, the adventurers could be hired by any powerful group in the Sword Coast area.)": "达古特-纽文伯在沃特德普的敌人不信任他，这也是理所当然的。沃特德普统治委员会的代表，也就是沃特德普的领主，可能会雇佣冒险者冒充雷隆的定居者，同时向城市的统治者报告任何可疑的情况。不久之后，冒险家们就会被卷入行动之中。(或者，这些冒险者不是为水底世界的领主做间谍，而是被剑海岸地区的任何有势力的团体所雇佣）。",

	"Some adventurers—those brave and foolish do-gooders—may just follow adventure, wherever it might lead. When these characters witness and thwart the attack on the Wayside Inn, the natural course of events leads them next to Leilon, and from there into the larger plots and machinations of the antagonists in the campaign.": "有些冒险家--那些勇敢而愚蠢的好人--可能只是追随冒险，无论它可能导致什么。当这些人物目睹并挫败了对路边旅馆的攻击时，事件的自然进程将他们引向雷隆，并从那里进入运动中敌对者的大阴谋和阴谋。",
	"Leilon was once a mining town that sold copper, nickel, and silver to Waterdeep. It was also a port where merchants sometimes offloaded goods on barges (since most ships cannot pass the town's shallow mud flats) to be transferred to cities along the Sword Coast.": "雷隆（Leilon）曾经是一个采矿镇，向沃特德普出售铜、镍和银。它也是一个港口，商人们有时会用驳船卸下货物（因为大多数船只无法通过镇上的浅滩），然后转运到剑海岸的城市。",
	"Two hundred years ago, the wizard Thalivar made his home here and raised a tower at the town center to conduct his mystical studies. The House of Thalivar was topped with a planar beacon that lured creatures from other planes into the structure, trapping them there. After Thalivar mysteriously disappeared, the people of Leilon were content to leave his tower and the monsters within alone.": "两百年前，巫师塔利瓦在这里安家，并在镇中心竖起一座塔，进行他的神秘研究。塔利瓦之家顶部有一个平面信标，引诱其他星球的生物进入该结构，将它们困在那里。在塔利瓦尔神秘地消失后，雷隆的人们满足于让他的塔和塔里的怪物们独处。",
	"The Spellplague, a divine phenomenon that twisted Faerûn's magic, corrupted the tower's defenses. The creatures sealed within were freed to attack Leilon, and the magic of the planar beacon was redirected back into the Material Plane, causing humanoids who looked upon it to become paralyzed. Leilon was quickly overrun and subsequently abandoned and has remained that way for more than a century.": "咒语瘟疫，一种扭曲法鲁恩魔法的神圣现象，腐蚀了塔的防御系统。被封印在里面的生物被释放出来攻击Leilon，平面信标的魔法被重新导向物质世界，导致看着它的人类变得麻痹。Leilon很快被占领，随后被遗弃，并一直保持了一个多世纪。",
	"The first action the soldiery of Neverwinter took in Leilon was to destroy the planar beacon inside the House of Thalivar.

	"Before its fall, Leilon was defended by a loosely organized group of adventurers called the Swords of Leilon. When the House of Thalivar released its monsters, the Swords fought to cover the escape of the townsfolk. They died, becoming ghosts bound to Leilon's ruins. They now watch the rebuilding of the town with caution, hoping that the reconstructed tower does not bring similar disaster.": "在沦陷之前，雷隆被一群松散的冒险者保卫着，他们被称为雷隆之剑。当塔利瓦家族释放其怪物时，剑士们为掩护镇民逃跑而战斗。他们死了，变成了被束缚在雷隆废墟上的幽灵。他们现在小心翼翼地观察着小镇的重建，希望重建后的塔不会带来类似的灾难。",

	"This amiable male halfling is the local priest of Lathander, god of light. Merrygold helped found the town following its reconstruction and is loved by its people.": "这个和蔼可亲的男性半身人是当地光明之神拉坦德的牧师。梅里戈德在小镇重建后帮助建立了这个小镇，并受到人们的喜爱。",
	"Lord Neverember gave this half-elf female the job of overseeing the town's fishing industry. With the recent opening of the quayside, she's now one of the most important figures in town.": "纽伦堡勋爵给这位半精灵女性的工作是监督该镇的渔业。随着最近码头的开放，她现在是镇上最重要的人物之一。",
	"Unlike {@adventure Dragon of Icespire Peak|DIP} and the two adventures that follow this one, this adventure does not use a \"quest board.\" (See \"{@area A Note on the Quest Board\"|035|x} sidebar below.) Below are a list of the quests and how they can be pursued.": "与{@adventure Dragon of Icespire Peak|DIP}和后面的两个冒险不同，这个冒险没有使用 \"任务板\"。(见下面的\"{@area A Note on the Quest Board\"|035|x}侧边栏。) 下面是一个任务清单，以及如何追求这些任务。",
	"The first two quests occur as the characters are traveling to Leilon for the first time:": "前两个任务发生在人物第一次前往Leilon的时候。",
	"After the characters complete both the starting quests, they can take up residence in Leilon and be called upon to complete any of the other quests, except for the final quest. These quests are provided by various members of the Leilon community. These can be completed in any order.": "在人物完成两个起始任务后，他们可以在Leilon居住，并被要求完成任何其他任务，除了最后的任务。这些任务是由Leilon社区的不同成员提供的。这些任务可以按任何顺序完成。",
	"Characters advance in level by completing quests. Regardless of the number of characters in the party, they gain a level when they complete three quests. The initial encounter, \"{@adventure Attack on the Wayside Inn|SLW|2},\" does not count as a quest.": "角色通过完成任务来提升等级。无论党内有多少角色，当他们完成三个任务时都会获得一个等级。最初的遭遇，\"{@adventure Attack on the Wayside Inn|SLW|2}\"，不算是一个任务。",
	"{@adventure Dragon of Icespire Peak|DIP} uses an excellent campaign-control quest mechanic to point characters in the right direction: the quest board. The two other adventures in this series use the quest board as well. In general, the quest board idea works wonderfully to show the players what options they have for seeking adventure.": "{@adventure Dragon of Icespire Peak|DIP}使用了一个优秀的战役控制任务机制来为角色指出正确的方向：任务板。这个系列中的另外两个冒险也使用了任务板。一般来说，任务板的想法非常好，可以向玩家展示他们在寻求冒险时有哪些选择。",
	"As this adventure opens, the town of Leilon doesn't have a quest board, because the infrastructure of the town is not in place. It doesn't make much sense to have a quest board when the adventurers are the only people in town who are capable of performing the tasks that the town needs done.": "在这次冒险开始时，Leilon镇没有任务栏，因为镇上的基础设施还没有到位。当冒险者是镇上唯一有能力完成镇上需要的任务的人时，有一个任务板就没有什么意义了。",
	"Instead, you can use the town council to introduce potential quests to the characters. Many of the quests in the adventure happen at the spur of the moment, so rather than having the characters learn about the needs of the town on a board, one of the three members of the town council will approach the characters directly.": "相反，你可以利用镇议会向人物介绍潜在的任务。冒险中的许多任务都是临时发生的，所以与其让人物在董事会上了解镇上的需求，不如由镇议会的三名成员之一直接与人物接触。",
	"If you still want to give the characters the freedom to choose from a variety of quests, the different members of the council could have different ideas of which quest is the most important and roleplaying the conflict between council members can add depth to the story. Will one council member be upset if the characters choose a different quest first? Will they have to do something to get back into that member's good graces?": "如果你仍然想让角色从各种任务中自由选择，委员会的不同成员可以对哪个任务是最重要的有不同的想法，在委员会成员之间进行角色扮演的冲突可以增加故事的深度。如果人物先选择不同的任务，一个委员会成员会不会不高兴？他们是否必须做一些事情来重新获得该成员的好感？",
	"As the adventurers travel toward Leilon, they pass the Wayside Inn, which is being attacked by undead creatures. The adventurers can thwart the attack and meet the residents of the inn, learning a bit about Leilon in the process.": "当冒险家们向Leilon行进时，他们经过了Wayside旅馆，该旅馆正受到不死生物的攻击。冒险家们可以挫败攻击，并与旅馆的居民见面，在这个过程中了解到一些关于Leilon的情况。",
	"\"Attack on the Wayside Inn\" and \"{@adventure A Normal Day in Leilon|SLW|3}\" are balanced for characters of 7th level, though characters of 8th level should be challenged as well.": "\"攻击路边旅馆 \"和\"{@adventure A Normal Day in Leilon|SLW|3} \"对7级的角色是平衡的，不过8级的角色也应该受到挑战。",
	"Many enterprising hostellers have tried to maintain an inn where the Triboar Trail meets the High Road. Some have succeeded for many years before falling victim to monsters or bandits. Others have given up relatively quickly, when the dangers become apparent.": "许多有进取心的旅馆老板都试图在特里波尔小道与大路的交汇处维持一家旅馆。有些人成功了很多年，然后落入怪物或强盗的手中。其他人则在危险变得明显时很快就放弃了。",
	"The current owner of the Wayside Inn is Martisha Vinetalker, a striking half-elf whose pleasing features contrast with her tough demeanor. She is cold, calculating, charismatic, and knows how to run a business with ruthless efficiency and an eye for profit.": "路边旅馆的现任老板是玛蒂莎-维纳克，一个引人注目的半精灵，她讨人喜欢的特征与她强硬的举止形成鲜明对比。她冷酷无情，精于计算，富有魅力，知道如何以无情的效率和对利润的关注来经营企业。",
	"The bartender is Backes Dunfield, a human with a scarred face and a crooked smile. He started working for Martisha six months ago and quickly proved himself a valuable lieutenant.": "酒保是巴克斯-邓菲尔德，一个脸上有疤痕、笑起来歪歪扭扭的人类。他六个月前开始为马蒂沙工作，并很快证明自己是一个有价值的副手。",
	"The cook is Cooragh Struckt, a half-orc who has been a close friend and confidante of Martisha for many years. Cooragh is famous for her incredibly tasty, and alarmingly well-spiced, stews and meat pies.": "厨师是库拉赫-斯特拉克特，一个半兽人，多年来一直是玛蒂莎的亲密朋友和知己。库拉格以其令人难以置信的美味和令人震惊的良好调味品、炖菜和肉馅饼而闻名。",
	"This encounter occurs at night. As the characters approach the junction of the Triboar Trail and the High Road, set the scene:": "这次遭遇发生在晚上。当人物接近特里波尔小道和大路的交界处时，设置场景。",
	"An oddly shaped building sits at the juncture of the Triboar Trail and the High Road. Two entrances into the building are apparent: a smaller one at the northern corner, and a larger one, suitable for beasts of burden and wagons, near the first.": "一座形状怪异的建筑坐落在特里波尔小道和大路的交界处。进入建筑的两个入口很明显：一个较小的入口在北角，另一个较大的入口在第一个入口附近，适合牲畜和马车通行。",
	"Right now, both sets of doors are under attack by humanoid figures. They have already breached the smaller door, and they are starting to make cracks in the larger.": "现在，两组门都受到了人形物体的攻击。他们已经攻破了小门，并开始在大门上制造裂缝。",
	"The smaller doorway leads into a cloak room, and another door bars the way into the common room from there. The larger doors lead into the courtyard, where there are stables and a smithy.": "较小的门洞通向衣帽间，另一扇门阻止了从那里进入公共房间的路。较大的门通向院子，那里有马厩和铁匠铺。",
	"The attacking creatures are comprised of 1 {@creature zombie} per player character, and 1 {@creature wraith} per every two characters (rounded down), excluding sidekicks. The zombies are the only ones attacking the building. The wraiths come out of the darkness after the party approaches the zombies.": "攻击的生物是由每个玩家角色1个{@creature zombie}，每两个角色1个{@creature wraith}(四舍五入)组成，不包括跟班。僵尸是唯一攻击建筑物的生物。队伍接近僵尸后，裹尸人从黑暗中出来。",
	"The zombies don't notice the party until the adventurers are within 60 feet of them, or until the party attacks. Then all the monsters turn their focus from the building to the party, who are easier to reach.": "僵尸不会注意到聚会，直到冒险者在他们60英尺范围内，或者直到聚会攻击。然后，所有的怪物都会把注意力从建筑上转移到派对上，因为他们更容易接近。",
	"The people within the Wayside Inn have barred the doors and windows, hoping the zombies would be unable to breach the doors. If the party runs into difficulty dealing with the creatures, occupants of the inn can open the windows and fire crossbows or other missile weapons at the monsters to help.": "路边客栈内的人把门窗都封死了，希望僵尸们无法攻破门窗。如果队伍在对付这些生物时遇到困难，旅店内的人可以打开窗户，向怪物发射弩箭或其他导弹武器来帮忙。",
	"Assuming the adventurers defeat the threat, the occupants unbar the doors and windows, allowing the party entrance.": "假设冒险家们打败了威胁，住户们就会解开门窗，让队伍进入。",
	"Martisha is thankful, but not ebullient in her praise or her rewards. She offers the characters food for their efforts, but not drink or lodging. Backes and the other occupants, however, make sure the characters drink for free this night. A traveling merchant also offers to pay for the characters' lodging for the evening.": "玛蒂莎心存感激，但并不热衷于赞美或奖励。她为这些人物的努力提供了食物，但没有提供饮料或住宿。然而，Backes和其他住客确保这些人物在这一晚免费喝酒。一个旅行的商人还提出为人物支付晚上的住宿费。",
	"Use the bullet points below to roleplay the rest the evening at the Wayside Inn:": "使用下面的要点来扮演晚上在Wayside旅馆的其余部分。",
	"Martisha sits in the corner at a lone table, poring over records and watching the business. She answers any attempts at conversation curtly. She wants to partner with the settlers of Leilon to set up a mutual protection pact, as well as a trade pact where she sells her vegetables and livestock in return for the goods they will produce.": "玛蒂莎坐在角落里的一张孤零零的桌子旁，翻阅着记录，看着生意。她很客气地回答任何试图交谈的人。她想与Leilon的定居者合作，建立一个相互保护的协议，以及一个贸易协议，她出售她的蔬菜和牲畜以换取他们将生产的货物。",
	"Backes keeps the ale flowing all night for the adventurers. He tells them that he gave up a life as a privateer (that is, a pirate) to get into business on land. He works the bar and assists Martisha, but he hopes to someday open his own place in Neverwinter or Waterdeep. He wears a pendant around his neck in the shape of a trident, which he says the crew of his last ship wore as a way to appease the many sea gods.": "巴克斯让冒险家们整晚都在喝啤酒。他告诉他们，他放弃了私掠者（也就是海盗）的生活，开始在陆地上做生意。他在酒吧工作并协助玛蒂莎，但他希望有一天能在永夜城或水底城开自己的店。他的脖子上戴着一个三叉戟形状的吊坠，他说他上一艘船的船员戴着这个吊坠是为了安抚众多海神。",
	"Cooragh only emerges from the kitchen long enough to thank the adventurers and give them a piece of her special pork pie. It is very spicy, but delicious for those who can stomach the burn. On her neck, beneath each ear, are tattoos of curved daggers. If asked, she admits she got them because she knew it would upset her mother, a human from Luskan. It was a foolish youthful folly, she says.": "库拉赫从厨房出来的时间只够感谢冒险家们，并给他们一块她特制的猪肉馅饼。它非常辣，但对那些能忍受灼热的人来说很美味。在她的脖子上，每只耳朵下面，都有弯曲的匕首的纹身。如果被问及，她承认她得到了它们，因为她知道这会让她的母亲，一个来自卢斯坎的人类感到不安。她说，这是一个愚蠢的年轻的愚蠢行为。",
	"The smith who works at the Wayside Inn smithy is a strapping woman called Teega who can wield a hammer in each hand like a titan. Her anvil is forged in the shape of a dolphin, and at night she drinks at the bar with the other patrons. She met Backes after his life as a pirate ended, and she hopes to join him in setting up a business in a city at some point. She makes jewelry in her spare time and wears a set of bronze bracers shaped like three lightning bolts. She proudly displays three suits of plate armor that she created, each bearing the same symbol as the design of her bracers.": "在Wayside Inn铁匠铺工作的铁匠是一个魁梧的女人，名叫Teega，她可以像泰坦一样双手挥舞铁锤。她的铁砧被锻造成海豚的形状，晚上她和其他顾客在酒吧喝酒。在巴斯克斯的海盗生活结束后，她认识了他，她希望在某个时候能和他一起在一个城市里建立起一个企业。她在业余时间制作珠宝，戴着一套形似三道闪电的青铜手镯。她自豪地展示着她制作的三套板甲，每套板甲上都有与她的手镯设计相同的符号。",
	"A young halfling named Silla Scalesweep sits at a table, humming to herself. She is traveling from Neverwinter to Leilon, hoping to get hired on as a fisher by Valdi Estapaar, the woman in charge of the fishery in the town. She wears her long hair in five braids atop her head, and she is very talkative. She also plays the harmonica quite well and is keen to have an audience.": "一个名叫Silla Scalesweep的年轻半身人坐在桌前，自顾自地哼着歌。她从永夜镇来到雷隆镇，希望能被瓦尔迪-埃斯塔帕尔雇佣为渔夫，她是该镇渔业的女负责人。她的长发在头顶上扎成五个辫子，她非常健谈。她的口琴也吹得很好，很想有一个听众。",
	"Tarbin Tul is a traveling bard who wanders the High Road, seeking new songs to add to his already impressive repertoire. Tarbin sits by the fire, singing along to Silla's ditties on the harmonica. He gladly buys a drink for anyone who helped drive off the undead.": "塔宾-图尔是一个旅行吟游诗人，他在高路上徘徊，寻找新的歌曲来增加他已经令人印象深刻的曲目。塔宾坐在火堆旁，用口琴伴着西拉的小曲唱歌。他很乐意为那些帮助赶走亡灵的人买酒。",
	"Feel free to populate the rest of the inn with travelers and staff. There are servers, farmers who work small fields nearby that supply the inn with food in return for protection and shelter on the inn's land, farmers who provide meat and milk, and other laborers. A few of these people came here because of Backes, and they serve him within the Cult of Talos.": "请自由地将客栈的其他部分与旅行者和工作人员填充在一起。有服务员，有在附近小田里工作的农民，他们为客栈提供食物，以换取客栈土地上的保护和庇护，还有提供肉类和牛奶的农民，以及其他劳动者。这些人中有几个是因为巴斯克斯而来到这里的，他们在塔洛斯教内为他服务。",
	"Some of the workers at the Wayside Inn are members of the Cult of Talos. This information should be hidden from the characters until it is ready to be revealed later in the adventure. Placing bad guys in the party's path before it is ready to be revealed is always a risk, but it is a great shock when it pays off.": "路边旅馆的一些工人是塔洛斯教派的成员。这个信息应该对角色们隐藏起来，直到在冒险的后期准备揭开它。在准备好揭开谜底之前，把坏人放在党的道路上总是有风险的，但当它得到回报时，会有很大的震撼。",
	"The best way to allay suspicion is to have the characters become friends with them early, especially during this opening encounter. The secret cultists can heap praise, rewards, free drinks, and information upon the adventurers, gaining their trust and friendship.": "打消怀疑的最好办法是让人物尽早与他们成为朋友，特别是在这个开场的遭遇中。秘密的邪教组织可以对冒险者进行赞美、奖励、免费饮料和信息，以获得他们的信任和友谊。",
	"This long con works best when you provide details that might later prove to be portents of the truth, if not actual clues. For example, the necklace worn by Backes is noteworthy early in the adventure, and it becomes clear later what it represents.": "当你提供一些细节，即使不是真正的线索，也可能被证明是真相的预兆时，这种长骗局的效果最好。例如，巴斯克斯戴的项链在冒险的早期就值得注意，后来它代表了什么就很清楚了。",
	"On the off chance that your players figure things out too quickly (or if someone is already familiar with the adventure), details can be changed. Backes is the leader of the Talos cultists at the inn, but he doesn't have to be. Maybe Cooragh the cook is really the leader, and Backes is just a patsy she is using to throw suspicion off herself. With just a few adjustments, you can keep your players guessing even after they think they know what's happening.": "如果你的玩家很快就想明白了（或者如果有人已经熟悉了这个冒险），可以改变细节。巴克斯是旅馆里塔洛斯邪教的领袖，但他不一定是。也许厨师库拉格才是真正的领袖，而巴克斯只是她用来摆脱自己嫌疑的一个替罪羊。只需做一些调整，你就可以让你的玩家猜测，甚至在他们认为自己知道发生了什么之后。",
	"After their time at the Wayside Inn, the characters have less than twenty miles of travel along the High Road to reach Leilon. Silla asks if she can travel with the party. If they say no, she simply follows behind them at a short and indiscrete distance, forlornly playing a sad tune on her harmonica at the thought of being shunned by the party.": "在路边旅馆的时间结束后，人物沿着高路还有不到20英里的路程才能到达Leilon。西拉问她是否可以和队伍一起旅行。如果他们说不行，她就跟在他们身后不远不近的地方，一想到自己会被队伍甩开，她就惆怅地用口琴吹起了悲伤的曲子。",
	"When the party gets less than a mile from the location where the town is being rebuilt, they come upon an impromptu town meeting. Most of the town is here; they have been evacuated to this point because the town guards sent up a warning that someone or something was invading Leilon.": "当队伍离重建城镇的地点不到一英里时，他们遇到了一个临时性的城镇会议。镇上的大部分人都在这里；他们被疏散到这里是因为镇上的卫兵发出了警告，说有人或有东西正在入侵雷隆。",
	"When the adventurers approach the settlers, use the following read-aloud text to describe the scene:": "当冒险家们接近定居者时，使用以下朗读文本来描述这个场景。",
	"Roughly fifty people stand in a clearing just off the High Road, where the forest to the northeast and the swampland to the southwest give way to grassland for a bit on each side of the road. The beginnings of gardens or larger fields of crops are half-dug here.": "大约有50人站在高路边的一块空地上，东北方向的森林和西南方向的沼泽地在路的两边各让出一点草地。在这里，花园或较大的农田的雏形被挖了一半。",
	"The people mill about in a panic. Some shake in fear, others shout in anger, and in the center of it all an enraged dwarf waves her arms and tries to get those around her to listen. A bored-looking human in a chain shirt and shield decorated with the sigil of Neverwinter stands next to the dwarf. He finally bangs his spear against his shield to quiet the tumult.": "人们惊慌失措地走来走去。有些人因恐惧而颤抖，有些人因愤怒而喊叫，而在这一切的中心，一个被激怒的矮人挥舞着手臂，试图让她周围的人听从。一个身穿链式衬衫、头戴装饰有永夜标志的盾牌、看起来很无聊的人类站在矮人旁边。他最后用他的长矛敲打着他的盾牌，以平息这场骚乱。",
	"The dwarf is Grizzelda Copperwraught, who the settlers call \"the Growler,\" but never within earshot of her. She was personally hired by Lord Neverember to oversee the rebuilding of the structures that will comprise the new town. She instructs the builders and gives them their pay at the end of each tenday.": "这个矮人就是格里泽尔达-科珀沃拉赫特，定居者们称她为 \"咆哮者\"，但从未在她耳边提起过。她受雇于纽伦堡勋爵，负责监督新镇的重建工作。她指导建筑工人，并在每个工作日结束时给他们发工资。",
	"Next to Grizzelda is Sergeant Hazz Yorrum. Yorrum is a human {@creature guard}, and in charge of the Neverwinter soldiers who protect the settlers while the town is being built. He is a coward, as lazy as he is corrupt.": "在格里泽尔达旁边的是哈兹-约鲁姆中士。Yorrum是一个人类{@creature guard}，负责在城镇建设时保护定居者的永夜士兵。他是个懦夫，既懒惰又腐败。",
	"Two other persons of note are here as well: Merrygold Brightshine and Valdi Estapaar. Merrygold is a priest of Lathander, the Morninglord. He and his church were given the rights to build the first temple in Leilon. The church of Lathander paid handsomely for the honor, and Merrygold and his staff assist in making sure that the workers get fed and cared for outside of their normal duties.": "还有两个值得注意的人也在这里。梅里戈德-布莱特希恩和瓦尔迪-埃斯塔帕尔。梅里戈德是晨曦之主拉坦德的牧师。他和他的教会获得了在Leilon建造第一座神庙的权利。拉桑德教会为这一荣誉付出了丰厚的代价，梅里戈德和他的工作人员协助确保工人们在正常工作之外得到食物和照顾。",
	"Valdi Estapaar is a half-elven fisher who is tasked by Lord Neverember to oversee the fishing industry that is supposed to support the town as it is built. The fish she and her subordinates catch feed the town, and the excess fish are cured and transported to the nearby cities for sale.": "瓦尔迪-埃斯塔帕尔是一个半精灵渔民，他受诺文伯勋爵的委托，监督渔业，而渔业应该是支持城镇建设的。她和她的部下捕到的鱼养活了整个小镇，多余的鱼被腌制后运到附近的城市出售。",
	"The Growler, Merrygold, and Valdi comprise the Leilon Town Council at this point in the town's development. While the Growler is ostensibly the leader, the council votes on major issues, so the Growler can be overruled if Merrygold and Valdi agree on a different plan.": "在小镇发展的这一阶段，成长者、梅里戈德和瓦尔迪组成了雷隆镇议会。虽然咆哮者表面上是领导者，但理事会对重大问题进行投票，所以如果梅里戈尔德和瓦尔迪同意不同的计划，咆哮者可以被推翻。",
	"The characters come within earshot of the meeting just as the Growler is about to address the townsfolk. The characters are free to step in and interrupt at any point, but use the bullet points below to guide the talk until they do:": "当咆哮者要对镇民讲话时，人物就会出现在会议的耳边。角色们可以在任何时候插话，但在他们插话之前，要用下面的要点来引导谈话。",
	"The Growler begins by berating the townsfolk for being such an unruly mob as they evacuated the town. She calls out a few individuals by name, shaming them in front of the group.": "咆哮者一开始就斥责镇民们在撤离小镇时是如此不守规矩的一群人。她叫出几个人的名字，当着大家的面羞辱他们。",
	"She asks if anyone saw anything strange happening in the town as they were evacuating. One of the stonemasons claims that she saw something strange happening in the water out on the swampland, past the marsh islands, but then she picked up her tools and ran as the soldiers ordered her to evacuate.": "她问是否有人在疏散时看到镇上发生了什么奇怪的事情。其中一个石匠声称，她看到在沼泽地上的水里发生了一些奇怪的事情，经过了沼泽岛，但后来她拿起工具就跑了，因为士兵们命令她撤离。",
	"Another stonemason claims to have seen heard some of the returning fishing-folk, who were still out on their skiffs in the marshland, shouting in panic. Others nod and \"harrumph\" to indicate they heard this as well.": "另一个石匠声称他听到了一些返回的渔民，他们仍然在沼泽地的小艇上，惊慌失措地喊叫着。其他人也点头并 \"哈哈大笑\"，表示他们也听到了这个声音。",
	"At this point a short dragonborn wearing a holy symbol of Lathander shouts, \"May the Morninglord forgive me! We are missing two of the children. Smithwell and Burnice aren't here. They were right behind me as we left the town.\" (The two human children are best friends, the son and daughter of two of the fishers who are still out in the water.)": "这时，一个矮小的龙裔戴着拉坦德的神圣标志，喊道：\"愿晨曦之神原谅我！\"。我们少了两个孩子。史密斯威尔和伯尼斯不在这里。我们离开小镇时，他们就在我身后。\" (这两个人类孩子是最好的朋友，是还在水里的两个渔夫的儿子和女儿)。",
	"This pronouncement sends the collected townsfolk into a panic again, forcing the guard Yorrum to put spear to shield to quiet the crowd.": "这句话让收集起来的镇民再次陷入恐慌，迫使卫兵约鲁姆把长矛放在盾牌上，让人群安静下来。",
	"Merrygold insists that they must immediately go back to town to retrieve the children, consequences be damned. The Growler insists that they stay right here until one of the soldiers from the town comes to tell them that it is safe. Until then, no one is going anywhere. Valdi seems unsure what to do, as no one here (except Sgt. Yorrum) is much of a fighter.": "梅里戈德坚持认为，他们必须立即回镇上找回孩子，后果自负。咆哮者坚持说，他们就呆在这里，直到镇上的一个士兵来告诉他们，这里是安全的。在那之前，任何人都不能去任何地方。瓦尔迪似乎不确定该怎么做，因为这里没有人（除了约鲁姆军士）是个战士。",
	"At this point that party should have heard enough to intercede into the conversation, even if it is just to volunteer to be the ones to head into town and check on the situation, retrieving the children if danger remains.": "在这一点上，那一方应该已经听到了足够的消息，可以介入谈话，即使只是自愿成为进城查看情况的人，如果仍有危险，就把孩子找回来。",
	"During the town meeting, two servants of the Morninglord are tasked with keeping an eye on a group of about twenty children between the ages of four and twelve. These kids belong to some of the workers in the town. While the parents work, the children are looked after and taught by the acolytes of Lathander who inhabit the Shrine of Lathander, which is currently the only finished stone building in the town.": "在镇会议期间，晨曦之神的两个仆人负责监视一群大约20个四岁到十二岁之间的孩子。这些孩子属于镇上的一些工人。当父母工作时，孩子们由居住在拉桑德神殿的拉桑德信徒照顾和教导，而神殿目前是镇上唯一完成的石头建筑。",
	"These children, some of them terrified and missing their parents, others mischievous and too young to understand consequences (much like adventurers), decide to run off in different directions during the meeting.": "这些孩子，有的惊慌失措，思念父母，有的调皮捣蛋，年纪太小，不明白后果（很像冒险家），决定在会议期间向不同方向跑去。",
	"Any players not engrossed by the town council discussion can be called upon to have their characters help the acolytes round up the wayward children. This could involve DC 10 ability checks like Strength ({@skill Athletics}) to get them down from trees, Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) to pull them out of the marshland, or Charisma ({@skill Persuasion} or {@skill Intimidation}) to cajole or order them to behave.": "任何没有全神贯注于镇议会讨论的玩家都可以被要求让他们的角色帮助圣徒们围捕那些不听话的孩子。这可能涉及到DC10的能力检查，比如用力量（{@skill Athletics}）把他们从树上弄下来，用灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）把他们从沼泽地里拉出来，或者用魅力（{@skill Persuasion}或{@skill Intimidation}）来劝说或命令他们听话。",
	"Whichever adventurer does the best job of corralling the children might gain an admirer. This child can be totally smitten or intrigued by the character, following them around, asking them questions constantly, and wanting to be just like the character (regardless of how inappropriate that might be).": "哪个冒险家在召集孩子方面做得最好，就可能获得一个仰慕者。这个孩子可能完全被这个角色迷住了，或者对其感兴趣，跟着他们走，不停地问他们问题，并想成为这个角色那样的人（不管这有多不合适）。",
	"After the drama (or comedy) of the town meeting has played out, and the party has decided on a course of action, the first threat comes to them in the form of a wagon full of anchorites of the Cult of Talos.": "在小镇会议的戏剧性（或喜剧性）上演之后，党派决定了行动方案，第一个威胁就以一辆装满塔洛斯教派锚泊者的马车的形式出现在他们面前。",
	"As enemy approaches, use the following read-aloud text to describe the situation:": "当敌人逼近时，使用以下朗读文本来描述情况。",
	"Strange knights bearing a symbol with three lightning bolts striking ride horses made of water. Accompanied by a wagon full of archers, pulled by another of the water steeds.": "带有三个闪电标志的奇怪骑士骑着水做的马。伴随着一辆装满弓箭手的马车，由另一匹水做的骏马拉着。",
	"The steeds move at 30 feet per round, and otherwise cannot attack or be harmed.": "骏马每回合移动30英尺，否则不能攻击或被伤害。",
	"As the Cult of Talos members attack, the rest of the citizens of Leilon scatter. The acolytes of Lathander shepherd the children to safety, and the rest of the adults move toward the safety of the nearby trees. Sgt. Yorrum, it should be noted, flees faster than anyone.": "随着塔洛斯教派成员的攻击，雷隆的其他公民也四散奔逃。拉桑德的信徒将孩子们护送到安全地带，其余的成年人则向附近的树木安全地带移动。应该指出的是，约鲁姆中士逃得比任何人都快。",
	"If the party defeats the cultists, they find that each of them bears a tattoo of three parallel lightning bolts on their forearms. If any are taken prisoner and questioned, they answer with the ominous ravings of those touched by divine madness. They claim that the Stormlord is coming to drown everyone and cleanse the world of the unworthy.": "如果队伍打败了邪教分子，他们会发现每个人的前臂上都有三个平行闪电的纹身。如果有人被俘虏并被询问，他们会用那些被神圣的疯狂所触及的不祥的呓语来回答。他们声称风暴领主要来淹死每个人，并将世界上不值得的人清洗掉。",
	"Seeing that this threat came from the village itself, the town council now understands the dire nature of the situation. It is possible that the guards and anyone else who was left in town is dead, and the town could be overrun with enemies. The council asks the party to sneak into town and assess the situation there. If the town is no longer safe, the settlers must return to Neverwinter in defeat.": "看到这个威胁来自村庄本身，镇议会现在明白了情况的严峻性。守卫和其他留在镇上的人有可能已经死了，镇上可能被敌人占领了。委员会要求党员们潜入镇子，评估那里的情况。如果镇子不再安全，定居者们必须在失败中返回永夜镇。",
	"After dealing with the members of the Cult of Talos, the characters should be in a hurry to get to Leilon and see what is happening.": "在处理完塔洛斯教派的成员后，人物应该急于赶到雷隆，看看发生了什么。",
	"By following the High Road, the party can easily get to town. They may also decide to approach from a less conspicuous direction. Either way, they can get to the edge of town without being spotted.": "沿着高路走，人们可以很容易地到达镇上。他们也可以决定从一个不太显眼的方向接近。无论哪种方式，他们都可以在不被发现的情况下到达城镇的边缘。",
	"When they reach Leilon, use the following read-aloud text to describe the situation:": "当他们到达Leilon时，使用下面的朗读文本来描述情况。",
	"The progress on the town's rebuilding has been slow, it appears. The holes for a palisade have been dug, but only a few logs are in place. At the center of the ruins, a tall tower, mostly collapsed, rests atop a bluff. The only intact stone building sits at the bottom of the bluff, its white façade bearing the mark of Lathander.": "看来，该镇的重建工作进展缓慢。围墙的洞已经挖好，但只有几根木头已经就位。在废墟的中心，一座高大的塔楼，大部分已经倒塌，坐落在悬崖之上。唯一完好的石头建筑位于悬崖底部，其白色外墙印有拉坦德的标记。",
	"There is an intact wooden building closer to the water marsh at the southwest side of town, smoke rising from two chimneys.": "在镇子的西南侧，有一座比较靠近水沼泽的完整的木制建筑，两个烟囱里冒着烟。",
	"In front of this building stands a tiefling dressed in blue robes. She raises her hands to the sky, and dark clouds appear in response. Before the tiefling, at the end of the swampy water, stand a small number of humans, greataxes raised in the air, who chant in response to her.": "在这座建筑前，站着一个身穿蓝色长袍的铁弗林。她向天空举起双手，乌云应声而现。在铁弗林之前，在沼泽地的尽头，站着一小部分人类，他们在空中举起大斧，为回应她而吟唱。",
	"In the previous scene, a plot point was introduced: ten-year-old friends Smithwell and Burnice were still in town during the attack. How you use them is up to you, as you know your players. Some players do not handle children in danger well. If this is the case, simply have the pair hiding safely in the Shrine of Lathander, emerging when the threat is gone.": "在上一个场景中，引入了一个情节点：十岁的朋友史密斯威尔和伯尼斯在袭击期间仍在镇上。你如何使用他们取决于你，因为你了解你的玩家。有些玩家不善于处理处于危险中的儿童。如果是这种情况，只需让这对夫妇安全地躲在拉坦德神庙里，在威胁消失后出现。",
	"If you want to add drama and motivation for the party, you can place the children out in the open, needing to be brought to safety before they are seen by the Talos cultists. Just remember that giving the characters something else to do in the encounter increases the difficulty of the encounter for the party.": "如果你想为队伍增加戏剧性和动力，你可以把孩子们放在外面，需要在他们被塔洛斯邪教分子看到之前把他们带到安全的地方。只需记住，在遭遇战中给角色一些其他的事情做，就会增加遭遇战对队伍的难度。",
	"The characters start 500 feet from the priest. She has already completed enough of her ritual to summon the water elemental, and every four rounds she is alive, she summons another water weird, up to the maximum described below. Once she has summoned the maximum number of creatures, she stops chanting and joins the combat, assuming the party has engaged in combat with her and the berserkers.": "人物从距离牧师500英尺处开始。她已经完成了足够的仪式来召唤水元素，她每活着四个回合，就会再召唤一个水怪，最多到下面描述的最大值。一旦她召唤了最大数量的生物，她就会停止吟唱并加入战斗，前提是党派已经与她和狂暴者进行了战斗。",
	"Note that even though she performs the ritual to summon these water creatures, they do not attack or even appear until this part of the battle has ended.": "请注意，即使她执行了召唤这些水生物的仪式，它们也不会攻击，甚至不会出现，直到战斗的这一部分结束。",

The waist-high water between the shore and the islands suddenly erupts as large watery forms emerge.": "水汪汪的沼泽地冒着气泡，翻滚着。闪电在天空中闪烁，显示出几个人形躺在离岸边60英尺的泥泞沼泽岛屿上。岸边和岛屿之间齐腰高的水面突然爆发，出现了巨大的水生形态。",
	"The damage to the town was minimal, and only a few of the settlers were killed, most of the them brave Neverwinter soldiers who gave their lives to protect the fishers caught in their boats during the attack.": "城镇的损失很小，只有少数定居者被杀，其中大部分是勇敢的永夜士兵，他们在攻击中为保护被抓到的渔民而献出了自己的生命。",
	"Now that the threats are removed, the party can inform the settlers that it is safe to return to Leilon. The settlers return to their work: construction, farming, fishing, and otherwise building their new home.": "现在，威胁已经消除，党可以通知定居者，可以安全地返回Leilon了。定居者们回到了他们的工作中：建筑、耕种、捕鱼，以及以其他方式建设他们的新家。",
	"As this adventure and the other two adventures in the series progress, the Leilon locations presented in the adventures represent the default growth of the town if the characters do not intervene too much. The more interest the adventurers take in building the town, however, the more is at stake when the town in threatened.": "随着这个冒险和系列中其他两个冒险的进展，如果人物不做过多的干预，冒险中呈现的Leilon地点代表了小镇的默认增长。然而，冒险者对建设该镇的兴趣越大，当该镇受到威胁时，风险就越大。",
	"For players interested in the town-building aspect of the campaign, you can even let them help plan the growth and building of the town, changing the map dramatically. This is not only fine—it is wonderful! You may need to tweak later adventures in and around the town, but that is one of the joys of running a D&D campaign: the unfolding story belongs to you and the players.": "对于对城镇建设方面感兴趣的玩家，你甚至可以让他们帮助规划城镇的发展和建设，大大改变地图。这不仅是好的--而且是很好的！你可能需要在以后的冒险中和周围地区进行调整。你可能需要在以后的冒险中和在小镇周围进行调整，但这也是运行D&D活动的乐趣之一：展开的故事是属于你和玩家的。",
	"Let the characters use their downtime to help build the palisade, create homes, fish and hunt, or otherwise pitch in if they desire. Otherwise, you can just declare that time passes with no more attacks until the next adventuring quest comes along.": "让角色们利用他们的休息时间来帮助建造围墙、创建家园、捕鱼和打猎，或者如果他们愿意的话，以其他方式参与。否则，你可以直接宣布，在下一个冒险任务出现之前，时间过去，不再有任何攻击。",
	"\"Aid from Phandalin\" is balanced for characters of 8th level, though characters of 7th level should be able to survive the encounters.": "\"来自范达林的援助 \"是为8级的角色平衡的，尽管7级的角色应该能够在遭遇战中生存。",

Nestled into the hills of the Sword Mountains, it has become a bustling area of trade and mining since brave heroes vanquished some of the threats to the area.": "范达林镇位于高路和特里波尔镇之间的特里波尔小道上。它坐落在剑山的山丘上，自从勇敢的英雄们战胜了对该地区的一些威胁后，它已经成为一个繁华的贸易和采矿区。",
	"To complete the Aid from Phandalin quest (see \"{@area Leilon Quests|02a|x}\"), the adventurers must escort the goatherd and her flock to Phandalin, pick up the goods at Barthen's Provisions, and survive the separate attacks of the forces of the necromancer Ularan Mortus and the Cult of Talos.": "为了完成范达林的援助任务（见\"{@area Leilon Quests|02a|x}\"），冒险者必须护送牧羊人和她的羊群到范达林，在巴特恩的供应处取货，并在死灵法师乌拉伦-莫特斯和塔洛斯教派的分别攻击下生存下来。",
	"Elmar Barthen, proprietor of Barthen's Provisions in Phandalin, is brokering a deal with a wealthy Waterdhavian merchant to sell some of Pinchwit's stock for a very lucrative profit. As a goatherd in the employ of Dagult Neverember and the town of Leilon, Pinchwit's profits are the town's profits.": "艾尔玛-巴顿是范达林的巴顿食品店的经营者，他正在与一个富有的沃特达威商人进行交易，以出售平奇威的一些存货，获得非常丰厚的利润。作为一个受雇于Dagult Neverember和Leilon镇的牧羊人，Pinchwit的利润就是这个镇的利润。",
	"However, part of the deal is that the goats must be brought to Phandalin. While Pinchwit is an excellent goatherd, she is less capable as a fighter. She and her goats need an escort from Leilon to Phandalin. The town council of Leilon also asks the characters to buy wagons to bring back a plethora of supplies that the town needs.": "然而，交易的一部分是必须将山羊带到范达林。虽然Pinchwit是一个优秀的牧羊人，但她作为一个战士的能力较差。她和她的山羊需要一个护卫队从Leilon到Phandalin。雷隆镇议会还要求这些人物购买马车，把镇上需要的大量物资运回来。",
	"The distance from Leilon to Phandalin is only twenty-one miles or so, but the route goes through forest and grassland unsullied by anything resembling a road or a path. Pinchwit wants to keep the flock off the main roads.": "从Leilon到Phandalin的距离只有21英里左右，但路线穿过森林和草原，没有任何类似于道路或小路的东西玷污。平奇威想让羊群远离大路。",
	"Additionally, goats are not the most obedient animals in the wide kingdom of creatures. They can only travel about three miles per day, making the trip to Phandalin a seven-day ordeal. And with a couple hundred unruly goats, what could possibly go wrong?": "此外，在广阔的生物王国里，山羊并不是最听话的动物。它们每天只能走大约三英里，这使得前往范达林的旅程需要七天的折磨。而且有几百只不守规矩的山羊，有什么可能出错呢？",
	"The characters have the following encounters as they travel to Phandalin.": "人物在前往范达林的过程中会有以下遭遇。",
	"At some point during the trip, a pair of {@creature Wyvern||wyverns} fly above the goat-train heading for Phandalin. The wyverns do not attack; even with their limited intelligence, they understand that such a large group of people could prove dangerous to them.": "在旅途中的某个时刻，一对{@creature Wyvern||wyverns}飞到了前往范达林的山羊列车上方。狼獾没有攻击；即使它们的智力有限，它们也明白这样一大群人可能会对它们造成危险。",
	"The goats, however, panic at the sight of these large predators, causing them to flee in every direction. The characters must do everything in their power to keep the goats together, because the wyverns do not hesitate to pick off stragglers.": "然而，山羊们一看到这些大型掠食者就惊慌失措，导致它们向各个方向逃窜。角色们必须尽一切努力使山羊们聚在一起，因为狼獾会毫不犹豫地将落单者挑走。",
	"They can stay together, saving half the herd but losing many of the goats to the wyvern attack. This reduces that money that the town could make from the merchant.": "他们可以呆在一起，保住了一半的羊群，但在狼人的攻击下损失了很多羊。这就减少了小镇可以从商人那里赚到的那笔钱。",
	"They can split up and each go after one of the groups of goats that split off. That means, however, that half the group must fight one wyvern, and the other half must fight the other, and they are 3000 feet away from each other, likely unable to help each other.": "他们可以分头行动，各自去追击分头行动的羊群中的一个。然而，这意味着一半的队伍必须与一只狼獾作战，另一半必须与另一只作战，而且他们彼此之间有3000英尺的距离，很可能无法互相帮助。",
	"One night (or day if the situation dictates), while the traveling goat show is resting for the evening, a family of ogres catches their scent. Being ogres, always hungry and particularly grumpy around goats, the ogres decide to attack.": "一天晚上（如果情况需要，也可以是一天），当旅行的山羊表演在晚上休息的时候，一个食人魔家族闻到了他们的气味。作为食人魔，他们总是很饿，而且对山羊特别暴躁，食人魔决定攻击。",
	"Assuming some of the characters are sleeping for the night, anyone on guard duty can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Animal Handling}) or Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check to notice that the goats are getting restless. This gives those on guard three rounds to wake up any sleepers and take precautions.": "假设有些角色在晚上睡觉，任何负责守卫的人都可以尝试用DC15智慧（{@skill Animal Handling}）或智慧（{@skill Insight}）检查，以发现山羊变得不安分。这给了那些守卫者三轮时间来唤醒任何睡觉的人并采取预防措施。",
	"After three rounds, the {@creature Ogre||ogres}, numbering three plus one per character, excluding sidekicks, charge out of the darkness and begin grabbing goats. When the characters intervene, the ogres drop the goats and attempt to smash the adventurers.": "三轮过后，{@creature Ogre||ogres}，数量为三个，每个角色加一个，不包括小弟，从黑暗中冲出来，开始抓羊。当人物进行干预时，食人魔放下山羊并试图砸死冒险者。",
	"Since this adventure and the ones that follow were designed to continue the story of {@adventure Dragon of Icespire Peak|DIP}, there's a good chance your players have already interacted with the NPCs in the town of Phandalin. If that is the case, then they have their own stories and their own relationships with the people of Phandalin. The town and the NPCs, as they are presented here, should be seen as just the beginning. You should change the attitudes of the NPCs, or the actual NPCs themselves, based on what has come to pass in your campaign.": "由于这次冒险和后面的冒险都是为了延续{@adventure Dragon of Icespire Peak|DIP}的故事，所以你的玩家很有可能已经和范达林镇的NPC互动过。如果是这样的话，那么他们就有自己的故事，有自己与范达林镇人民的关系。这里所介绍的小镇和NPC，应该被看作是一个开始。你应该根据你的活动中所发生的事情，改变NPC的态度，或者实际的NPC本身。",
	"If the characters have not been to Phandalin, you can learn more about the town in the {@i D&D Starter Set} or {@i D&D Essentials Kit}. If you do not wish to purchase any products that detail Phandalin, you can create your own Phandalin based on the areas described in this adventure.": "如果人物没有去过范达林，你可以在{@i D&D Starter Set}或{@i D&D Essentials Kit}中了解更多关于这个小镇的信息。如果你不想购买任何详细介绍范达林的产品，你可以根据这次冒险中所描述的区域创建自己的范达林。",
	"When the characters arrive in Phandalin, Pinchwit scurries off to Barthen's Provisions to finalize the deal. The characters are free to go to the merchant's establishment with her, or they can explore the town, picking up a wagon and the supplies needed by the town of Leilon.": "当人物到达范达林时，平奇维特匆匆忙忙地去了巴特恩的物资店敲定交易。人物可以自由地和她一起去商人的场所，或者他们可以探索这个镇子，拿起一辆马车和Leilon镇需要的物资。",

	"As the characters go about the business of procuring and securing wagons, horses, and the supplies needed back in Leilon, they might learn about some spies who have recently arrived in Phandalin, some working for the Cult of Talos, and others employed by Ularan Mortus and the followers of Myrkul.": "当角色们去采购和确保马车、马匹以及回到雷隆所需的物资时，他们可能会了解到最近到达范达林的一些间谍，有些人为塔洛斯教工作，有些人则受雇于乌拉然-莫特斯和米尔库尔的信徒。",
	"This is a modest, two-story roadhouse with rooms for rent and a common area for purchasing food and drink. Toblen Stonehill, a short, friendly human, runs the establishment.": "这是一家规模不大的两层楼公路旅馆，有房间出租，还有一个购买食物和饮料的公共区域。托布伦-斯通希尔（Toblen Stonehill）是一个矮小、友好的人，负责管理这个机构。",
	"While the characters are in the common room at night, Toblen looks up as the door opens. The door closes quickly without anyone entering, and Toblen shakes his head in wonder. He says he thinks it was Argus Skeel who just opened the door and left immediately. Skeel is a newcomer who claims to be a prospector but never seems to be prospecting. He only comes around at night.": "当这些人物晚上在公共房间时，托布伦抬头看了看，因为门开了。门很快就关上了，没有人进来，托布伦惊讶地摇了摇头。他说，他认为是阿古斯-斯基尔刚打开门就马上离开了。斯基尔是一个新来的人，他声称自己是一个探矿者，但似乎从来不会去探矿。他只在晚上出现。",
	"If the characters follow Skeel into the shack, they cannot find him. A DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check finds the secret door in the floor leading to the basement, where the undead hide. If the characters find and deal with them here, the undead don't attack as the characters try to leave town.": "如果角色们跟随斯基尔进入棚屋，他们无法找到他。通过DC20智力（{@skill Investigation}）检查可以找到地板上通往地下室的暗门，那里是亡灵的藏身之处。如果角色们在这里找到并处理它们，当角色们试图离开小镇时，亡灵们就不会攻击。",
	"Linene Graywind, a middle-aged woman, runs the coster, and she sells the horses that the characters need for Leilon. She doesn't have any carts for sale but tells the characters that they can probably pick some up at the Miner's Exchange in town.": "Linene Graywind是一位中年妇女，经营着这家服装店，她出售人物在Leilon需要的马匹。她没有马车可卖，但她告诉角色们，他们也许可以在镇上的矿工交易所买到一些。",
	"Linene has a new assistant, a red-haired elf going by the name of Velleen Firecrow. Velleen makes deliveries and manages trade in the surrounding area, with a team of kobolds who seem to adore her. Velleen is also a member of the Cult of Talos, acting as a spy for the comings and goings in Phandalin. (See \"{@area The Attack|06d|x}\" below for more information on Velleen and the kobolds.)": "Linene有一个新的助手，一个红发的精灵，名字叫Velleen Firecrow。维莱恩负责送货并管理周围地区的贸易，她有一队哥布林，似乎很喜欢她。维莱恩也是塔洛斯教派的成员，在潘达林的来往中充当间谍。(关于维莱恩和哥布林的更多信息，请看下面的\"{@area The Attack|06d|x}\"。",
	"If the characters find the Talos symbol at the Shrine of Luck and show it to Linene, she recognizes it as something Velleen wears as a brooch, although she hasn't seen her wearing it in a couple of days.": "如果角色们在幸运神殿找到了塔洛斯的标志，并把它拿给琳恩看，她就会认出这是维勒恩作为胸针佩戴的东西，尽管她已经有几天没有看到她佩戴它了。",
	"If the characters approach Velleen about her lost brooch, the cultist and her kobold servants attack. If they are defeated, the characters do not have to face them later as they pack to leave the town.": "如果角色接近维莱恩关于她丢失的胸针，邪教徒和她的哥布林仆人就会攻击。如果他们被打败了，那么角色们以后在收拾行李离开小镇时就不必再面对他们了。",
	"The characters can procure carts and wagons at the Phandalin Miner's Exchange, which is operated by the crafty Halia Thornton. Halia knows about the spies in town, but she won't reveal anything without getting paid at least 50 gp for the information.": "角色们可以在范达林矿工交易市场购买手推车和马车，该交易市场由狡猾的Halia Thornton经营。哈莉娅知道镇上的间谍，但如果没有得到至少50戈比的信息，她是不会透露的。",
	"She is willing to tell the characters as much or as little information as you want her to provide. And if the characters treat her rudely or try to pay her less than she asks, she happily tells Skeel, Velleen, or both exactly what the characters know and what their plans are.": "她愿意按照你的要求告诉人物多少信息，也愿意提供多少信息。如果人物对她无礼，或试图给她的报酬低于她的要求，她会很高兴地告诉斯基尔、维林，或两者都告诉人物所知道的情况和他们的计划。",
	"The characters were asked by the Leilon town council to pick up ten vials of holy water at the shrine. When the characters arrive, the place is empty, and the shrine has been ransacked. There is no sign of anyone who worked here, but with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check, the characters find a silver pin displaying three parallel lightning bolts. This should indicate to them that worshippers of Talos are in town.": "角色们被Leilon镇议会要求到圣地领取十瓶圣水。当人物到达时，这里已经空无一人，神殿也被洗劫一空。没有任何在这里工作过的人的迹象，但是在成功通过DC15智力（{@skill Investigation}）检查后，人物发现了一个银针，上面有三个平行的闪电。这应该表明塔洛斯的崇拜者就在镇上。",
	"This stone building has a wooden roof, a bell tower in the back, and an empty job board in the front. Harbin Wester, the townmaster and a wealthy banker, is polite if the characters see him, although he seems to be worried and fretful—more so than usual.": "这座石头建筑有一个木制屋顶，后面有一个钟楼，前面有一个空的招聘栏。哈尔滨-维斯特是镇长，也是一位富有的银行家，如果人物见到他，他会很有礼貌，尽管他似乎很担心，很焦躁--比平时更担心。",
	"If the characters ask, he confides in them that the weather has been particularly fierce recently. Winds have come out of nowhere and damaged buildings, and three people have been struck by lightning.": "如果人物问起，他向他们坦白，最近的天气特别凶猛。大风不知道从哪里吹来，损坏了建筑物，有三个人被雷电击中了。",
	"Also, a few people seem to have gone missing over the last couple of tendays. No one can say for sure, because the people who may be missing are visitors or travelers with no ties to Phandalin. It's possible that they simply left town, but some of them seemed to indicate that they were going to be around longer.": "另外，在过去的几个工作日里，似乎有几个人失踪了。没有人可以确定，因为可能失踪的人是与潘达林没有关系的游客或旅行者。有可能他们只是离开了小镇，但其中一些人似乎表明他们要在这里待更长时间。",
	"When the characters are packing up to take the supplies back to Leilon at the end of their visit, the spies from both the Cult of Talos and the followers of Myrkul independently decide they are too big a threat to let live. (If the characters have already dealt with both spies, this encounter doesn't happen.)": "当人物在访问结束后收拾东西准备把物资带回Leilon时，来自Talos教派和Myrkul的追随者的间谍独立地决定他们是一个太大的威胁，不能让他们活着。(如果人物已经处理了这两个间谍，那么这个遭遇就不会发生）。",

	"Combat is a highlight of the game for a large number of players: they love the challenge, the tactics, and the drama. A battle involving three different sides at the same time can provide all of those highlights writ large. Running such a combat, however, takes care and practice.": "对于大量的玩家来说，战斗是游戏的亮点：他们喜欢挑战、战术和戏剧。一场同时涉及三个不同方面的战斗可以提供所有这些亮点。然而，进行这样的战斗需要谨慎和练习。",
	"With a three-sided combat, it is very easy to simply overwhelm the characters if you turn all the attention on the party. On the other hand, such a combat can be too easy if the other two sides simply wipe each other out while the adventurers watch.": "在三面作战的情况下，如果你把所有的注意力都集中在当事人身上，就很容易简单地把人物压倒了。另一方面，如果另外两方在冒险者的注视下简单地消灭对方，这样的战斗也会太容易了。",
	"Below are some tips for running a three-sided combat:": "以下是运行三面作战的一些提示。",
	"Start by focusing most attacks on the characters. Doing this establishes the tone and danger of the situation quickly. The players should be aware from the outset that if all the enemies turned on them at once, the encounter would likely go very poorly for them.": "开始时，将大多数攻击集中在人物身上。这样做可以迅速建立起局势的基调和危险性。玩家应该从一开始就意识到，如果所有的敌人都一下子转向他们，那么这场遭遇战很可能会对他们非常不利。",
	"Keep a close eye on the hit points of the characters. When the adventurers begin to feel a sense of hopelessness or peril beyond their capability, then have the other sides focus on each other for a while, giving the characters a chance to recover and regroup.": "密切关注人物的命中率。当冒险者开始感到无望或危险超出他们的能力范围时，则让对方集中精力对付一段时间，让角色有机会恢复和重新组织。",
	"Encourage tactical thinking. If one of the sides of the battle consists of savage monsters or mindless undead, give clues that they attack the nearest enemy rather than thinking tactically. This might encourage characters to move away from those enemies, or push other enemies into their path. This highlights the kind of tactical play that some players thrive on.": "鼓励战术性思考。如果战斗的一方由野蛮的怪物或无意识的亡灵组成，那么就提供线索，让他们攻击最近的敌人，而不是进行战术思考。这可能会鼓励角色远离这些敌人，或者把其他敌人推到他们的路上。这就突出了一些玩家兴致勃勃的那种战术性游戏。",
	"End dramatically. Three-sided battles can sometimes take longer because of the number of combatants participating. Use your discretion as the DM to have the excitement of the battle build up rather than fizzle out. When it's clear that the characters have the upper hand, turn on the monster toward them. But when it is clear that the characters will be victorious, have the remaining enemies fall quickly to avoid a drawn-out and anticlimactic denouement.": "结束的时候很夸张。由于参加战斗的人数较多，三边的战斗有时会花费更多时间。作为管理人，你要斟酌一下，让战斗的兴奋感逐渐增强，而不是逐渐消失。当人物明显占了上风时，就把怪物转向他们。但是，当很明显人物将获得胜利时，让剩余的敌人迅速倒下，以避免出现冗长而反常的结局。",
	"After the characters have dealt with the spies, either individually through investigation or at once as they are packing to leave, the characters can search them for clues.": "在人物处理完间谍后，可以通过调查单独处理，也可以在他们打包离开时一次性处理，人物可以在他们身上寻找线索。",
	"The ghouls working for Skeel bear the same skull marks at the ones who attacked the Wayside Inn during the introduction of this adventure. Skeel's clothes are riddled with thorns and barbed seeds from plants that are only found in the Mere of Dead Men. This can indicate to the characters that the larger undead threat may stem from that marsh.": "为斯基尔工作的食尸鬼与本冒险介绍中袭击路边旅馆的食尸鬼有着相同的头骨印记。斯基尔的衣服上布满了荆棘和带刺的种子，这些植物只有在死人沼泽才有。这可以向人物表明，更大的亡灵威胁可能来自那个沼泽地。",
	"Velleen and her kobolds each conceal hidden symbols of the Cult of Talos. She also carries a case containing a pair of lenses and a note in Common that says, \"The lenses show the secrets of the map.\" If these lenses are used to view the map found in the basement of the Wayside Inn, it reveals secret writing that points out various other locations of Cult of Talos activity up and down the Sword Coast, with the Thunder Cliffs circled as the central hub of activity.": "维莱恩和她的哥布林各自藏着塔洛斯教派的隐藏符号。她还带着一个箱子，里面有一副镜片和一张普通话的纸条，上面写着：\"镜片显示了地图的秘密\"。如果用这些镜片查看在路边旅馆地下室发现的地图，就会发现一些秘密文字，指出塔洛斯教在剑海岸上下的其他活动地点，而雷霆崖则被圈定为活动的中心。",
	"\"Foul Weather at Wayside\" is balanced for characters of 8th level, though characters of 7th level should be able to survive the encounters.": "\"Wayside的恶劣天气 \"是为8级的角色平衡的，尽管7级的角色应该能够在遭遇战中生存。",

However, they probably did not learn all of its secrets!": "由于角色们在这次冒险的早期进行了\"{@adventure Attack on the Wayside Inn|SLW|2} \"的介绍性遭遇战，他们应该熟悉这个地方，以及在那里工作和居住的关键NPC。但是，他们可能并没有了解到这里的所有秘密",
	"Most of the staff employed at the Wayside Inn are cultists of Talos who follow the dark teachings of Fheralai Stormsworn, a priest of the Stormbringer. Although the inn's owner does not know this, the bartender, Backes Dunfield, is a lieutenant of Stormsworn, fully pledged to the subjugation of the Sword Coast by his master. The rest of the cultists at the Wayside Inn see Backes as their leader however, to be protected and obeyed in any circumstance.": "路边旅馆的大部分员工都是塔洛斯的邪教徒，他们遵循风暴使者的牧师费拉莱-风暴之神的黑暗教义。虽然旅馆的老板不知道这一点，但酒保巴克斯-邓菲尔德（Backes Dunfield）是风暴使者的副手，他完全致力于征服他主人的剑海岸。然而，路边旅店的其他邪教徒将巴克斯视为他们的领袖，在任何情况下都应受到保护和服从。",
	"The local cultists have received orders to kidnap a local bard, Tarbin Tul, and then turn the Wayside Inn into a shrine to Talos.

	"As they draw power into the shrine within the Wayside Inn, the cultists summon storms to do the bidding of their master. This results in foul weather and raging skies appearing right above the inn, while the rest of the area is sunny and calm. If the adventurers can intervene in time, they can stop the ritual and save Leilon from destructive weather in their immediate future.": "当他们向路边旅馆内的神龛汲取力量时，邪教分子就会召唤风暴来听从他们主人的命令。这导致了恶劣的天气和狂暴的天空出现在旅店的正上方，而其他地区则是阳光明媚，风平浪静。如果冒险家们能及时介入，他们就能阻止这个仪式，使雷隆在不久的将来免受破坏性天气的影响。",
	"To complete the Foul Weather at Wayside quest (see \"{@area Leilon Quests|02a|x}\"), the adventurers must defeat the cultists of Talos at the Wayside Inn, destroy the shrine of Talos before it is fully activated, rescue the sacrifices, and find clues to the location of the cultists' hideout at the Thunder Cliffs.": "为了完成Wayside的恶劣天气任务（见\"{@area Leilon Quests|02a|x}\"），冒险者必须在Wayside旅馆击败塔洛斯的邪教徒，在塔洛斯的神龛被完全激活之前将其摧毁，拯救祭品，并找到邪教徒在雷霆崖的藏身之处的线索。",

Subtle differences in repeated scenes can add to the horror, comedy, or drama of a situation.": "在D&D冒险中，如同在任何叙事事业中，重复是一个强有力的工具。图像或符号在重复时，会成为一种加强故事的模式。重复场景中的细微差别可以增加一个场景的恐怖、喜剧或戏剧性。",

	"For example, if the characters danced in the common room during their time at the Wayside Inn previously, the ritual being performed by the cultists could incorporate movement that harkens back to that dance.

	"This journal belonged to the wizard Thalivar and details the studies he conducted inside the tower using a device called the Planar Beacon. The light of this artifact drew creatures from across the planes and trapped them inside the tower for him to study.

The entries stop here for over a hundred years.": "这本日记属于巫师塔利瓦，详细记录了他在塔内使用一种叫做 \"平面灯塔 \"的装置进行的研究。这件神器的光芒吸引了来自各个星球的生物，并将它们困在塔内供他研究。这本日记揭示了塔利瓦的灯塔是如何发掘出一个名为毁灭之石的强大魔法物品。塔利瓦致力于获取它--但他是否找到了它却是个谜。条目到此为止，已有一百多年。",
	"Dates on the entries and the freshness of the ink reveal that the later entries have been made in the last few days. Thalivar describes how he visits a ruined version of his tower in his dreams each night. In this dead world, he is drawn to a pile of rubble in the ruined chamber where his beacon once lay. Each time he draws close to the rubble, a terrible dread holds him back. Thalivar wishes his faerie servant Soapwort were here to assure him that he's dreaming, but the faerie never turns up. Thalivar prays that these nightmares will end soon so he may resume his studies in peace.": "条目上的日期和墨水的新鲜度表明，后来的条目是在最近几天写的。萨利瓦尔描述了他如何在每晚的梦中访问他的塔的一个废墟版本。在这个死寂的世界里，他被吸引到废墟中的一堆瓦砾上，他的灯塔曾经躺在那里。每当他靠近那堆瓦砾时，一种可怕的恐惧就会把他拉回来。Thalivar希望他的精灵仆人Soapwort能在这里向他保证他是在做梦，但那个精灵从未出现过。萨利瓦尔祈祷这些噩梦能尽快结束，这样他就能平静地继续他的研究。",

	"A half-orc stonemason named Breltora Red-Eye approaches the characters one morning, a worried expression on her face. She is friends with one of the soldiers, Private Vester Jessup. He works under Sgt. Yorrum, and he was set into the Mere of Dead Men as part of a regularly scheduled patrol. Vester told Breltora that Yorrum has them patrol the stretch of the High Road that runs along the edge of the terrible swamp to ensure that no dangerous creatures have established lairs there.": "一天早上，一个名叫Brettora Red-Eye的半兽人石匠走近这些人物，脸上带着担忧的表情。她是其中一个士兵的朋友，二等兵维斯特-杰赛普。他在约鲁姆军士手下工作，他是作为定期巡逻的一部分被安排到死人谷的。维斯特告诉布莱尔托拉，约鲁姆让他们在沿着可怕的沼泽地边缘的那段公路上巡逻，以确保没有危险的生物在那里建立巢穴。",
	"Since the reestablishment of Leilon, none of these patrols have spotted anything more dangerous than a nest of snakes or a random alligator.

	"If the characters talk to Sgt. Yorrum, he brushes off their concerns with a lazy wave of his hand. He says he can't spare any more of his troops to look into the missing soldiers, especially with the recent threats from the lightning worshippers and the undead. He tells the party that they can look for the missing soldiers if they want. If they ask for more information, he sighs and makes a production of pulling out a map to show the party the normal patrol area.": "如果人物与约鲁姆军士交谈，他就会懒洋洋地挥挥手，将他们的担忧一笔带过。他说他无法抽出更多的部队来调查失踪的士兵，特别是最近来自闪电崇拜者和不死族的威胁。他告诉大家，如果他们愿意，可以去寻找失踪的士兵。如果他们要求得到更多的信息，他就会叹气，并拿出一张地图，向大家展示正常的巡逻区域。",
	"The Mere of Dead Men is an expansive marsh that has been a bane to travelers along the High Road for centuries. All attempts to tame the wild swamp have failed, as countless threats call the area home: young dragons, trolls, lizardfolk tribes, swamp beasts, and even more aberrant monsters.

	"Recently, a relatively peaceful lizardfolk tribe living in the vicinity of the High Road was forced to relocate when a group of rot trolls attacked their home.

The Cliffs rest along the coastline halfway between the Mere of Dead Men and the city of Neverwinter.": "雷霆崖被当地人命名为 \"雷霆崖\"，是因为海浪撞击这个俯瞰剑海的高崖时发出的声音。悬崖就在死人谷和永夜城之间的海岸线上。",
	"The caves at the base of the Thunder Cliffs were once a haven for pirates, smugglers, and legitimate seafaring vessels looking for a safe place to wait out coastal storms. The shore there is inaccessible except by sea, making it the perfect haven for sea travelers.": "雷霆崖底部的洞穴曾经是海盗、走私者和寻找安全地方等待沿海风暴的合法航海船只的天堂。那里的海岸除了海路之外无法到达，因此是海上旅行者的完美天堂。",
	"Unfortunately, the Cult of Talos decided to use the caves of the Thunder Cliffs as a base of operations in the area, turning the place into a graveyard for ships and sailors alike. The anchorites used magic to install dangerous reefs in the area, proving deadly to vessels traveling the coast.": "不幸的是，塔洛斯教派决定利用雷霆崖的洞穴作为该地区的行动基地，把这个地方变成了船只和水手的墓地。抛锚者用魔法在该地区安装了危险的暗礁，证明对在海岸线上行驶的船只是致命的。",
	"Now the cultists of Talos collect the goods from the wrecked ships to fund their operation. They imprison survivors from the wrecks to sell as slaves, to die in the twisted rites that honor their violent god, or to feed the monsters that share the caves with them.": "现在，塔洛斯的崇拜者从失事的船只上收集货物来资助他们的行动。他们把沉船上的幸存者囚禁起来，作为奴隶出售，在扭曲的仪式中死去，以纪念他们的暴力之神，或者喂养与他们共享洞穴的怪兽。",

	"The fishing boats used by the fishing fleet of Leilon are not capable of making the trip to the Thunder Cliffs. The seas have been too rough, and the waves on the open ocean would crush the smaller fishing vessels. However, the town of Leilon will pay for the characters' passage on another vessel.": "雷隆渔船队使用的渔船没有能力前往雷霆崖。海面上的风浪太大，公海上的海浪会压垮小型渔船。不过，雷隆镇会支付人物乘坐其他船只的费用。",

The area at the base of the Thunder Cliffs, once you reach it, is known for being peaceful and welcoming to vessels.": "不过，瓦尔迪可以利用她对该地区海员的了解，为他们找到一些可能的人，带他们去雷霆崖。一旦到达雷霆崖底，该地区以和平和对船只的欢迎而闻名。",

Both are trustworthy and should be traveling toward the Thunder Cliffs within the next tenday.": "她心中有两艘船和船长，他们经常沿着剑海岸旅行，代表商人运输货物，以及运送旅行者。这两艘船都值得信赖，应该在下一个工作日内向雷霆悬崖行驶。",
	"The first is Stands in Tar, a jovial if slightly off-kilter tabaxi. She is known for her recklessness, but her daring has also earned her a reputation for being able to do the impossible. Her corsair ({@vehicle sailing ship}), the Dancing Delight, is fast and agile.": "第一个是 \"站在柏油里\"，这是一个活泼的，甚至有点不正常的tabaxi。她以鲁莽著称，但她的大胆也为她赢得了能够完成不可能的任务的声誉。她的海盗船({@vehicle sailing ship})，\"跳舞的快乐\"，速度快，动作灵活。",

They each plead their case for being the best ship and crew for the job.": "瓦尔迪-埃斯塔帕尔把塔巴西人 \"塔尔 \"和龙裔 \"克里斯托芬 \"带到人物面前，让他们向这两位船长提问。他们各自申辩自己是最适合这项工作的船只和船员。",
	"Kristoffen looks at Stands in Tar with a mixture of disgust and horror, shaking his head in disbelief that anyone would even consider choosing the drunken tabaxi and her ship over him and his. He explains to the party that his ship is more reliable and safer, which they might need on the seas that have become more violent of late. He goes on to reveal that he's heard rumors that the once-safe caves at the base of the Thunder Cliffs have recently become more dangerous. Stand in Tar scoffs at that idea.": "克里斯托芬用一种厌恶和惊恐的目光看着塔尔的斯坦兹，摇头表示不相信有人会考虑选择这个醉醺醺的塔巴西人和她的船，而不是他和他的。他向大家解释说，他的船更可靠、更安全，他们在最近变得更加暴力的海上可能需要这些。他继续透露说，他听说有传言说雷霆崖底部曾经安全的洞穴最近变得更加危险。站在塔尔对这个想法嗤之以鼻。",
	"Feel free to roleplay the interactions here as much or as little as you are comfortable. If the characters ask to get a read on the attitudes of the two captains, Stands in Tar is pretty much as advertised: competent but foolhardy, experienced but overly confident.": "请自由发挥这里的互动作用，只要你觉得舒服就可以。如果角色们要求了解两位船长的态度，斯塔德在塔尔的态度和宣传的差不多：有能力但愚蠢，有经验但过分自信。",
	"Kristoffen, on the other hand, is hiding something. With a successful DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check, a character can sense that the dragonborn is nervous and hiding something. If confronted, he says that he just has a bad feeling about traveling to the Thunder Cliffs, but he is willing to do so for the payment and the friendship he shares with Valdi Estapaar.": "另一方面，克里斯托芬也在隐藏一些东西。只要成功通过DC20智慧（{@skill Insight}）检查，一个角色就能感觉到这个龙裔很紧张，并隐藏着什么。如果被问及，他说他只是对前往雷霆崖有不好的预感，但他愿意为了报酬和他与瓦尔迪-埃斯塔帕尔的友谊而这样做。",

	"At some point, the characters must decide which vessel and captain they prefer. The town covers the cost of passage there and back for the characters, and both captains ask the same fare, so that should not enter into the decision.": "在某些时候，人物必须决定他们喜欢哪艘船和哪位船长。城镇为人物支付往返的费用，两位船长要求的票价都一样，所以这不应该成为决定因素。",
	"Whomever the party chooses is pleased, and the other captain simply accepts the decision and walks away. They are both ready to go as soon as the characters are.": "无论当事人选择谁，都会很高兴，而另一位队长则简单地接受决定，然后走开。他们两人都准备好了，只要人物准备好了就可以走了。",

	"The captain (of either ship) refuses to turn over control of the ship peacefully. Castisha offers to let the captain get into a dingy and go ashore safely, but if they don't go peacefully, the mutineers are willing to do it the hard way. The mutineers make it clear they will not hurt the party and will honor the contract that was agreed upon.": "船长（任何一艘船）都拒绝和平地交出船只的控制权。卡斯蒂沙提出让船长坐上小艇安全上岸，但如果他们不和平地走，哗变者就愿意硬来。哗变者明确表示，他们不会伤害党，并将履行约定的合同。",
	"Without the characters' help, neither captain can defeat the mutineers. If the adventurers do nothing, the mutiny succeeds.": "没有人物的帮助，两个队长都无法打败叛变者。如果冒险家们什么都不做，兵变就会成功。",
	"The adventurers may attempt to speak on behalf of the captain, hoping to talk the mutineers out of their plans. Castisha has already made up her mind, and nothing short of magical compulsion can get her to back down. The rest of the mutineers, however, are willing to listen to reasons why they shouldn't overthrow their captain. Set the DC for succeeding at 15, and then adjust based on the tactics the characters use.": "冒险家们可以尝试代表船长说话，希望能说服哗变者放弃他们的计划。卡斯蒂沙已经下定决心，没有什么能让她退缩的魔法强迫。然而，其余的哗变者愿意听一听他们为什么不应该推翻船长的理由。设定成功的DC为15，然后根据角色使用的策略进行调整。",
	"The adventurers are much more powerful than the sailors, even though they are outnumbered. If the characters defeat at least half the sailors, or Castisha and a quarter of the sailors, the mutiny ceases immediately.": "冒险家们比水手们强大得多，尽管他们在人数上处于劣势。如果角色们击败了至少一半的水手，或者卡斯特沙和四分之一的水手，叛变就会立即停止。",
	"This captain, a human named Captain Starling Winchet, trades stories and ale with the captain and crew of the characters' ship. She tells a tale that is of particular interest to the adventurers. While the {@i Uneasy Alliance} was passing near the Thunder Cliffs, they spotted a great deal of wreckage, which likely came from the waters directly before the caves there. They did see any survivors or salvageable wreckage, so they steered very clear of the area.": "这位船长是一位名叫斯塔林-温切特船长的人类，他与这些人物的船只的船长和船员交换故事和酒水。她讲了一个冒险家们特别感兴趣的故事。当{@i Uneasy Alliance}号经过雷霆崖附近时，他们发现了大量的残骸，这些残骸可能来自那里的洞穴之前的直接水域。他们没有看到任何幸存者或可打捞的残骸，所以他们对该地区避之不及。",
	"Captain Winchet also relays that she's heard other sailors talking about seeing a ghost ship in this area recently. The ship is only seen from a distance, but it is as hazy as the smoke from a cannon and emits a low moaning sound that carries across the water. She hasn't personally seen the ghost ship, but she feels obligated to pass along the information.": "温切特船长还转述说，她听到其他水手说最近在这个地区看到了一艘鬼船。这艘船只能从远处看到，但它就像大炮的烟雾一样朦胧，并发出低沉的呻吟声，传遍水面。她没有亲自见过这艘鬼船，但她觉得有义务把这个信息传递出去。",

Then, from the crow's nest, a voice screams, \"Ghost ship ahead.\" Before the words can even register, spectral figures emerge from the mist, swooping up onto the decks.": "天空变暗，浓雾从水中升起，遮蔽了船周围的视线。船员们发誓并做出迷信的表示。然后，从乌鸦嘴里传出一个声音，\"前方有鬼船\"。话音未落，幽灵般的身影就从迷雾中出现，飞快地冲上甲板。",
	"One {@creature allip|MTF} per three adventurers (rounded down) and two {@creature Specter||specters} per character, excluding sidekicks, use the cover of the mist to approach the ship. The allip's howling babble instantly stuns everyone on the ship except the adventurers, as the crew collapses in a heap. Even if they get up during the battle, the sailors are terrified and do nothing but flee and cower under the undead assault.": "每三个冒险者有一个{@creature allip|MTF}(四舍五入)，每个角色有两个{@creature Specter||specters}，不包括跟班，利用迷雾的掩护接近这艘船。阿利普的嚎叫咿呀声瞬间惊呆了船上的所有人，除了冒险者，因为船员们都倒在了地上。即使他们在战斗中站起来，水手们也被吓坏了，只能在亡灵的攻击下逃跑和畏缩。",

	"The adventure assumes that the characters access the caves of the Thunder Cliffs via the sea. Reaching the caves via the top of the Thunder Cliffs would mean a dangerous trek through hostile territory, then a long climb (or fall) from the top of the cliffs to the surf below. Still, some players, as soon as you tell them they cannot do something, want to do just that. If they insist, let them.": "这次冒险假定人物是通过海路进入雷霆崖的洞穴的。通过雷霆悬崖的顶部到达洞穴意味着要在敌对地区进行危险的跋涉，然后从悬崖顶部到下面的冲浪处进行漫长的攀爬（或坠落）。不过，有些玩家，一旦你告诉他们不能做什么，就想这么做。如果他们坚持，就让他们做吧。",

	"After the drama on the high seas, the party's transport finally arrives in the vicinity of the Thunder Peaks. The tops of the cliffs are visible for a great distance, long before the party can see the caves along the shoreline.": "在公海上的戏剧性表演之后，党的交通工具终于抵达了雷峰附近。悬崖的顶部在很远的地方就能看到，在队伍看到海岸线上的洞穴之前很久。",
	"Heeding the words of Captain Winchet, the captain of the party's vessel drops anchor at least a mile offshore, telling the adventurers that the vessel cannot get any closer based on what they've learned on the trip. The characters are welcome to take a large rowboat the rest of the way. The ship will wait here until they return, or for five days, whichever comes first.": "听从温切特船长的话，队伍中的船长在离岸至少一英里的地方抛下了锚，告诉冒险家们，根据他们在旅途中了解到的情况，船只不能再靠近了。欢迎人物乘坐大划艇走完剩下的路程。船只会在这里等待，直到他们回来，或者五天，以先到者为准。",

	"The previous guardians are not the only creatures that protect the shore in the service of Talos. A {@creature huge giant crab|TftYP} (see {@adventure appendix A|SLW|10}), or two crabs if there are more than four characters, including sidekicks, floats under the surface 200 feet from shore. It waits until a boat or swimming creatures pass above it, then it swims up and attacks, tipping over the boat if it is still in use. If creatures are flying, the crab waits until they land on shore, then rushes out to attack.": "之前的守护者并不是唯一为塔洛斯服务而保护海岸的生物。一只{@creature huge giant crab|TftYP}（见{@adventure appendix A|SLW|10}），如果有四个以上的角色，包括跟班，则是两只螃蟹，漂浮在离岸边200英尺的海面下。它等待着，直到有船或游泳的生物经过它的上方，然后它就游上去攻击，如果船还在使用，就把它翻过来。如果生物在飞行，螃蟹会等待它们登陆岸边，然后冲出去攻击。",
	"The caves at the base of the Thunder Cliffs, used by seafarers for centuries, are now controlled by the Cult of Talos. A tyrannical and supremely devout servant of Talos, Gadrille the Reef-Reaver, oversees the operations here.

	"The map of the Thunder Cliffs Caves represents the cave system at low tide. The yellow parts of the map show the sandy areas that become flooded at high tide. The water-filled areas within the caves themselves are always there, flooded even at low tide.": "雷霆崖洞穴的地图代表了低潮时的洞穴系统。地图上的黄色部分显示的是在涨潮时被淹没的沙地区域。洞穴内充满水的区域本身一直存在，即使在低潮时也会被淹没。",
	"The operation undertaken by the Cult of Talos here is not complicated. They lure unsuspecting ships close to the caves, wreck the ships on the magical reefs, capture the crew, and drag the wreckage into the caves. Anything worthwhile is salvaged and sold, and the prisoners are either sold to slavers or sacrificed to Talos.": "塔洛斯教派在这里采取的行动并不复杂。他们把毫无戒心的船只引到洞穴附近，在神奇的礁石上撞毁船只，抓走船员，然后把残骸拖进洞穴里。任何有价值的东西都会被打捞并出售，而囚犯则被卖给奴隶主或献给塔洛斯。",

	"If the characters are able to approach without tripping the alarm, they might hear some disgruntled cultists talking while they work. If the alarm was tripped, the cultists wait with weapons drawn and cannot be surprised.": "如果人物能够在不触发警报的情况下接近，他们可能会听到一些不满的邪教分子在工作时的谈话。如果警报被触发，邪教分子就会拔出武器等待，不能出其不意。",
	"If the adventurers get a chance to hear the cultists talking, use the following read-aloud text to portray that conversation:": "如果冒险者有机会听到邪教分子的谈话，就用下面的朗读文字来描绘这段对话。",
	"A severely damaged ship leans against a ledge. Atop the ledge, a handful of workers offload crates, boxes, and barrels from the ship.

On a failure, the cultists attack.": "无论党的战术是什么，都要让角色扮演来支撑这场遭遇战，直到解决这个问题的时候。如果冒险者向邪教分子提出了一个令人信服的提议，他们可能会按照党派的要求做，而不需要检查。如果结果是不确定的，就让他们做一个最后的能力检查，以确定会发生什么。如果失败，邪教分子就会发动攻击。",
	"On a success, however, the party now has a valuable resource. The cultists are unlikely to turn traitor completely and join the characters, but they might give the characters valuable information about who and what lives in the caves, where the important areas are, and anything else they might need to know.": "然而，一旦成功，党派现在有了一个宝贵的资源。这些邪教徒不可能完全背叛并加入角色，但他们可能会给角色提供有价值的信息，比如谁和什么人住在洞穴里，重要区域在哪里，以及其他他们可能需要知道的东西。",

If nothing happens, Gadrille takes that as a sign Talos approves.": "当加德利尔认为一个邪教徒缺乏成为塔洛斯真正仆人的适当信仰时，这个邪教徒就会被拖到这里，并被扔进喷水孔的水中接受审判。有时他们会被拉到井底，有时会有一股水柱把他们从井口吹上来，有时什么也没发生。如果什么都不发生，加德利尔就认为那是塔洛斯认可的标志。",

	"If the characters can defeat Gadrille and her cultists' salvage operation, they have struck a great blow to the plans of the Cult of Talos in the immediate area.

And they'll need it, because evil, unlike them, never rests.": "如果角色们能打败加德利尔和她的邪教分子的打捞行动，他们就对塔洛斯邪教在附近地区的计划造成了巨大的打击。在不久的将来，沿着大道建立神殿的计划被取消了，雷隆的英雄们可以回到他们的新家，进行应有的休息。他们需要休息，因为邪恶与他们不同，从不休息。",
	"After the characters have dealt with the threat of the Cult of Talos on the Thunder Cliffs, they can return to Leilon with the information they obtained.

Of course, a threat from the swamp might threaten to interrupt the blessing ceremony.": "如果在\"{@area Missing Patrol|032|x} \"任务中与蜥蜴人部落达成了和平，部落首领可能会邀请角色加入他们，以庆祝蜥蜴人文化中的一个神圣的夜晚，即对蛋的祝福。这个场合对一个适应自然的角色来说是有意义的，他甚至可以成为一窝蜥蜴人幼崽的 \"教父\"。当然，来自沼泽地的威胁可能会打断祝福仪式的进行。",

	"Build a home. With the characters (hopefully) proving themselves to be the heroes that Leilon needs, the town council might offer one or more of them a parcel of land.

Of course, such a place would also need to serve a purpose to the town, like having an extra root cellar to store food, or a secret room to keep extra weapons for the soldiery.": "建一个家。随着人物（希望）证明自己是Leilon需要的英雄，镇议会可能会给他们中的一个或多个提供一块土地。他们可以花费金钱和资源以及时间来建造自己的家园。当然，这样的地方也需要为小镇服务，比如有一个额外的地窖来储存食物，或者有一个秘密的房间来存放士兵们的额外武器。",
	"Build other structures. It is still early in the process of rebuilding Leilon, and there is much to do. The construction of the palisade has barely begun.

	"Making items. With the warning that too many magic items can inadvertently ruin a campaign by making characters too powerful to be truly challenged, characters could spend time creating magical or mundane items for themselves, others, or the town. For some items, of course, the certain components must be collected, and that could be an adventure of its own.": "制造物品。警告说，过多的魔法物品可能会无意中毁掉一个活动，因为它使人物过于强大而无法受到真正的挑战，人物可以花时间为自己、他人或城镇创造魔法或世俗物品。当然，对于某些物品来说，必须收集特定的部件，这可能是一个独立的冒险。",

	"In order to catch up to the lizardfolk tribe, the party must succeed on three DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) checks. On a failed check, roll on the {@adventure Mere Encounters table|SLW|7|Mere Encounters} for a random encounter in the swamp. Note that anyone attempting or aiding with the {@skill Survival} checks to follow the tracks cannot attempt Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks to spot random encounters, as they are too focused on the details of tracking.": "为了赶上蜥蜴人部落，队伍必须成功通过三次DC 15的感知检定{@skill Survival}。如果检定失败，在沼泽中随机遇到敌人，请在{@adventure Mere Encounters table|SLW|7|Mere Encounters}上投掷骰子。请注意，任何尝试或协助进行{@skill Survival}检定以追踪踪迹的人员，不能尝试感知检定{@skill Perception}来发现随机遭遇，因为他们过于专注于追踪的细节。",
	"After three successful {@skill Survival} checks are attained, the characters come upon the lizardfolk tribe as they stop for a rest. Move on to \"Fighting the Lizards\" below.": "在完成三次成功的{@skill Survival}检查后，角色们在休息时遇到了蜥蜴人部落。继续阅读下面的“与蜥蜴人战斗”。",
	"The leader is a {@creature lizardfolk subchief|GoS} (see {@adventure appendix A|SLW|10}) called Hissain. The large lizardfolk with him is a {@creature lizardfolk render|GoS} (see {@adventure appendix A|SLW|10}) whom the others call Slosh. The warriors who follow Hissain's orders are normal {@creature lizardfolk}, and there is one per character, including sidekicks. The sleds and cages are pulled by {@creature Flail Snail|VGM|flail snails} (see {@adventure appendix A|SLW|10}), but only one of those creatures' attacks (the one next to Hissain), unless they are attacked first. The rest of the lizardfolk in the tribe are young, elderly, and other noncombatants.": "领袖是一个名叫Hissain的{@creature lizardfolk subchief|GoS}(见{@adventure appendix A|SLW|10})。与他在一起的大型蜥蜴人是一个名叫Slosh的{@creature lizardfolk render|GoS}(见{@adventure appendix A|SLW|10})，其他人称他为Slosh。遵循Hissain命令的战士是普通的{@creature lizardfolk}，每个角色都有一个，包括搭档。雪橇和笼子由{@creature Flail Snail|VGM|flail snails}(见{@adventure appendix A|SLW|10})拉动，但只有那些生物中的一个会攻击（靠近Hissain的那个），除非它们首先受到攻击。部落中其余的蜥蜴人是年轻人、老年人和其他非战斗人员。",
	"The other is Kristoffen, a white dragonborn. He is calculating, efficient, and somber. He captains a {@vehicle galley} called the Ice Floe, which is specially outfitted to break through the icy waters of the far north.": "另一个是克里斯托芬(Kristoffen)，一个白色龙裔。他冷静、高效、沉默寡言。他是一艘名为冰流(Ice Floe)的{@vehicle galley}的船长，专门配备了能够穿越极北冰水的设备。",
	"Within a few days, the two captains arrive via {@vehicle rowboat} through the marsh to talk to the party. Their vessels are anchored out at sea, awaiting the party if they are selected as the method of conveyance.": "在几天之内，两位船长通过湿地{@vehicle rowboat}到达，与队伍交谈。如果他们被选为交通工具，他们的船只将锚泊在海上等待队伍。",
	"Stands in Tar staggers slightly as she stands. A successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check reveals that the tabaxi has been in the rum-soaked catnip and is not totally sober. She does, however, plead her case eloquently. Her ship is faster and more agile, and her crew smaller and less likely to gossip about their mission. There isn't a ship on the sea that the {@i Dancing Delight} can't outmaneuver or outrun on the open ocean.": "在塔尔站立时稍微摇晃。成功的DC 15智力检定揭示这只塔伯西已经沉浸在浸满朗姆酒的猫薄荷中，并没有完全清醒。然而，她却能雄辩地陈述自己的情况。她的船更快更灵活，她的船员更少，也不太可能在任务中传播流言。在开阔的海洋上，没有一艘船能比得上{@i Dancing Delight}，无论是在机动性还是逃跑速度上。",
	"If for any reason the characters attack Kristoffen because they learn of his affiliation with the Cult of Talos, he defends himself. Kristoffen (use {@creature half-red dragon veteran} statistics but replace fire with cold in attacks and resistances) can summon a pair of {@creature Air Elemental||air elementals} that serve him on behalf of Talos, which appear at the end of the first round of combat.": "如果角色因为得知克里斯托芬(Kristoffen)与塔洛斯邪教有关而攻击他，他会进行自卫。克里斯托芬(使用{@creature half-red dragon veteran}的属性，但在攻击和抗性中将火属性替换为冰属性)可以召唤一对{@creature Air Elemental||air elementals}，它们代表塔洛斯为他服务，并会在战斗的第一轮结束时出现。",
	"The crew of the {@i Ice Floe} is unhappy because their captain has been acting differently within the last couple of months. He has turned down more lucrative contracts to sail northwest to the Moonshae Isles in order to stay closer to Neverwinter. This has meant less pay for the crew, which they are not pleased about.": "{@i Ice Floe} 的船员们感到不高兴，因为他们的船长在过去几个月里表现出了不同寻常的举动。他拒绝了更有利可图的合同，选择向西北航行前往莫恩谢群岛，以便更靠近“无冬之夜”。这意味着船员们的报酬减少了，他们对此感到不满。",
	"A day into the journey, after the party has heard some grumbling among the sailors, the crew confronts the captain. Regardless of the vessel, the mutiny is led by Castisha (female Calishite {@creature swashbuckler|VGM}; see {@adventure appendix A|SLW|10}), the first mate. She is backed by four sailors ({@creature Bandit||bandits}) per character, excluding sidekicks.": "在旅程的第一天，当队伍听到水手们之间有些抱怨后，船员们面对船长。无论船只如何，这次叛变是由Castisha（卡利姆人女性{@creature swashbuckler|VGM};见{@adventure appendix A|SLW|10}）这位大副领导的。她得到了四名水手的支持（{@creature Bandit||bandits}）每个角色，不包括随从。",
	"For example, if one of the characters shoots a fireball into the sky to intimidate the sailors into standing down, the Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) check to cow the sailors might just be DC 10, or it might even succeed automatically.": "例如，如果其中一个角色向天空发射火球，以恐吓水手们退缩，那么用魅力检定({@skill Intimidation})来吓倒水手们的难度可能只是DC 10，甚至可能会自动成功。",
	"As the party's ship sails north toward the Thunder Cliffs, a southward-sailing vessel approaches them. The ships drop anchor and the captain of the other vessel, called the {@i Uneasy Alliance}, comes aboard the ship.": "当派对的船只向北驶向雷霆悬崖时，一艘向南航行的船只靠近他们。两艘船都下锚，另一艘船的船长，名为{@i Uneasy Alliance}，登上了这艘船。",
	"The top of the cliffs is home to a tribe of Talos-worshipping aarakocra who act as a guard for the cult. Many will attack when the characters approach, but some will hang back and see what happens. If the characters succeed in defeating the group, the rest of the aarakocra pester the party as they try to climb down the 800-foot-high cliffs. And, of course, the {@creature invisible stalker} and {@creature Manticore||manticores} are always ready to attack intruders.": "悬崖顶部是一个供奉塔洛斯(Talos)的阿拉科克拉(aarakocra)部落的家园，他们充当教派的护卫。当角色接近时，许多人会发起攻击，但也会有一些人退后观望。如果角色成功击败了这群人，其余的阿拉科克拉会在角色试图爬下这座高达800英尺的悬崖时骚扰他们。当然，{@creature invisible stalker}和{@creature Manticore||manticores}总是准备好攻击入侵者。",
	"The water and air, which have been relatively peaceful until now, suddenly turn violent as the party approaches shore. Jagged reefs magically spring up out of the water. The reefs can be avoided in the maneuverable {@vehicle rowboat}, but a larger ship would have been torn apart on the rocks.": "当队伍靠近岸边时，一直相对平静的水和空气突然变得狂暴起来。锯齿状的礁石神奇地从水中冒了出来。在{@vehicle rowboat}的机动性下，可以避开这些礁石，但一艘更大的船只会在礁石上被撕成碎片。",
	"Creatures in the water find the rough waves treacherous. Creatures without a swim speed must succeed on a DC 10 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to take an action without going under. On a failed check, or if the creature takes an action without attempting the check, that creature begins to drown (see \"{@book Suffocating|PHB|8|Suffocating}\" in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}).": "水中的生物发现汹涌的波浪很危险。没有游泳速度的生物必须在不被淹没的情况下成功进行一次DC 10的力量检定({@skill Athletics})才能采取行动。如果检定失败，或者生物在未尝试检定的情况下采取行动，那个生物就会开始溺水（见{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的“{@book Suffocating|PHB|8|Suffocating}”）。",
	"The shore is lined with thin wire treated with a modified version of the {@spell alarm} spell. Water and other natural circumstances do not trigger the spell, but any humanoid creatures that trip the wires cause an alarm to sound within the caves, alerting the cultists that intruders are present.": "岸边铺满了用一种改良版{@spell alarm}咒语处理过的细铁丝。水和其他自然环境不会触发这个咒语，但任何绊倒这些铁丝的人形生物都会在洞穴内响起警报，提醒邪教徒有入侵者出现。",
	"The wires can be spotted with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. Getting to shore without tripping the wires is practically impossible, but the wires can be disarmed with a DC 15 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check, or the {@spell alarm} spell can be suppressed for an hour using {@spell dispel magic}.": "成功进行一次DC 15的感知检定，就能发现这些电线。要想不触发电线就成功上岸几乎是不可能的，但可以通过进行一次DC 15的敏捷检定来拆除电线，或者可以使用{@spell dispel magic}来抑制{@spell alarm}法术一个小时。",
	"If the characters are able to approach without tripping the alarm, they might hear some disgruntled cultists talking while they work. If the alarm was tripped, the cultists wait with weapons drawn and cannot be {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised}.": "如果角色能够接近而不触发警报，他们可能会听到一些工作时抱怨的邪教徒在交谈。如果触发了警报，那些邪教徒会持武器待命，且无法被 {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised}。",
	"In the cave, three {@creature Sea Hag||sea hags} chew on the hands and feet of sailors who drowned after being shipwrecked on the magical reefs. The cultists supply the bodies in return for help from the coven when dealing with special problems, and the two forces have an easy mutual-protection pact.": "在洞穴中，三名{@creature Sea Hag||sea hags}啃食那些在神奇暗礁上遇难后溺水的水手的手和脚。邪教徒提供尸体，以换取与魔法咒会在处理特殊问题时的帮助，这两股势力之间有一个简单的互相保护协议。",
	"Piles of slimy seaweed act as beds for the three sisters: Nana Pocktuss, Auntie Unk, and Granny Muyuk. The trio is using the inedible parts of the bodies to create assistants that look like flying skulls with long stingers. There is one {@creature skull flier|SLW} per character, excluding sidekicks. You can find the statistics for these creatures in {@adventure Appendix A|SLW|10}.": "一堆堆黏糊糊的海草充当了三姐妹的床：Nana Pocktuss、Auntie Unk和Granny Muyuk。这三人正在利用身体的不可食用部分创造助手，看起来像带有长刺的飞行头骨。每个角色（不包括配角）有一个{@creature skull flier|SLW}。你可以在{@adventure Appendix A|SLW|10}中找到这些生物的统计数据。",
	"While the incredibly devout Gadrille the Reef-Reaver leads the group of cultists at the caves, Fheralai Stormsworn assigned a second-in-command to assist her—with special instructions to keep an eye on Gadrille to ensure she doesn't kill all her followers in a fit of mad devotion to Talos. That second-in-command is Sovendahl Erkinze, a {@creature drow elite warrior}.": "在洞穴中，极其虔诚的海礁掠夺者加德里尔(Gadrille the Reef-Reaver)领导着一群异教徒，风暴誓约者菲拉莱(Fheralai Stormsworn)指派了一位副手来协助她——特别是要密切关注加德里尔，以确保她不会在对泰洛斯的疯狂虔诚中杀死所有追随者。那位副手是{@creature drow elite warrior}索文达尔·厄金泽(Sovendahl Erkinze)。",
	"A successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check reveals that the ailment is not a disease, but a curse. A character who casts {@spell remove curse} on Sovendahl earns the drow's thanks. As a reward, the he gives the characters a magic item has been storing away: a {@item dagger of venom}.": "一次成功的DC 15感知检定揭示了这种疾病不是疾病，而是诅咒。一个对Sovendahl施放{@spell remove curse}的角色会赢得那位黑暗精灵的感谢。作为奖励，他会给角色们一个一直保存着的魔法物品：一个{@item dagger of venom}。",
	"If the characters kill Sovendahl and his bodyguards, they do not find the magical dagger, which is hidden carefully in a secret location outside the caves. They do, however, get 250 gp in various coins, 3 {@item Potion of Greater Healing||potions of greater healing}, and a jade brooch worth 500 gp.": "如果角色们杀死了索文达尔(Sovendahl)和他的护卫，他们将找不到那把被小心藏在洞穴外秘密地点的魔法匕首。然而，他们会得到各种硬币共计250 gp，3 {@item Potion of Greater Healing||potions of greater healing}，以及价值500 gp 的翡翠胸针。",
	"This area is where the cultists of the lowest standing sleep and eat. At any time, there are eight {@creature Scout||scouts} here, sleeping in four bunk beds that line the walls, or eating their fish broth at the table in the center of the room before heading out to perform their tasks. The cultists here when the characters arrive are dedicated to their god and will not surrender or negotiate.": "这个区域是最低级教徒们睡觉和进餐的地方。任何时候，这里有八名{@creature Scout||scouts}教徒，他们睡在靠墙的四张双层床上，或者在房间中央的桌子上吃着鱼汤，然后再出去执行任务。当角色到达时在这里的教徒都对他们的神忠诚，不会投降或谈判。",
	"The truth is that the blowhole is a magical portal. When a living creature enters the blowhole, roll a {@dice d10}. On a 1-8, nothing happens. On a 9, the creature is pulled down into the shaft, through a portal, and appears moments later floating in Waterdeep Harbor, alive and well. On a 10, the creature is pushed up through the ceiling by the geyser. With a successful DC 10 Strength saving throw, a creature can grab onto the side of the shaft and avoid getting pushed through the portal. On a failure, the creature tumbles through a portal at the top of the shaft and ends up in the Elemental Plane of Water. (Perhaps a passing {@creature marid} takes pity on the creature and uses {@spell plane shift} to return it home—for a price!)": "事实上，喷气孔是一个神奇的传送门。当一个生物进入喷气孔时，投掷一个{@dice d10}。在1-8时，什么也不会发生。在9时，生物被拉入通道，穿过传送门，片刻后出现在活生生的Waterdeep Harbor中。在10时，生物被喷泉推向天花板。通过一次成功的DC 10力量豁免才能抓住通道的一侧，避免被推入传送门。失败时，生物将经过通道顶部的传送门，最终出现在水元素位面中。（也许一位经过的{@creature marid}对这个生物表示怜悯，并使用{@spell plane shift}将其送回家园——需付出代价！）",
	"A successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check of the area reveals scrape marks around the blowhole, where people have grabbed hold while attempting to keep from getting sent away.": "一次成功的智力检定（DC 15）可以发现该区域周围有刮痕，人们在试图避免被冲走时曾抓住这些痕迹。",

	"Gadrille the Reef-Reaver is a female half-elf {@creature evoker|VGM}. She spends most of her time out with her followers, preying on those too weak to withstand the ravaging power of Talos. When in the caves, however, she is in her chambers praying.": "Gadrille the Reef-Reaver是一名女性半精灵{@creature evoker|VGM}。她大部分时间都和她的追随者在一起，猎杀那些无法抵御塔洛斯的毁灭力量的人。然而，在洞穴里，她会呆在自己的房间里祈祷。",
	"Talos has rewarded Gadrille for her devotion with a pet, whom she calls \"{@creature Tooth-N-Claw|SLW}.\" This beast uses {@creature hell hound} statistics but replace fire with cold in attacks and immunities. {@creature Tooth-N-Claw|SLW} is ferociously protective of Gadrille. If there are more than four characters, excluding sidekicks, add a second pet called \"Frost-N-Fang.\"": "塔洛斯奖赏了加德里尔对他的忠诚，送给她一只宠物，她称之为“{@creature Tooth-N-Claw|SLW}”。这只野兽使用{@creature hell hound}的属性，但在攻击和免疫中将火属性替换为冰属性。{@creature Tooth-N-Claw|SLW}对加德里尔充满了凶猛的保护意识。如果除了助手之外有超过四个角色，会再添加一只名为“冰牙”的第二只宠物。",
	"This area is Gadrille's private shrine. In addition to the carved limestone likeness of Talos in one corner, the walls are carved with images of Talos's destructive power.
