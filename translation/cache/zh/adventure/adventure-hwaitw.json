	"The earth beneath Leya felt unusually warm. She reached down to confirm and pulled back in pain immediately. Her feathers were seared slightly. The season had been unusually dry, but this was a frightening temperature. After a closer look, it seemed like the ground was glowing.": "蕾娅（Leya）脚下的大地异常温暖。她伸手确认，立刻因疼痛而缩了回来。她的羽毛被轻微地烧焦了。这个季节异常干燥，但这种温度令人恐惧。仔细一看，地面似乎在发光。",
	"CRACK! Leya's eyes went to the sound. The large tree she'd played in as a child had fallen, and smoke rose from its remains. \"Go!\" her mind yelled, and she listened, rushing towards home. \"Get to them before—\"": "嘭！蕾娅的眼睛朝着声音看去。她小时候玩耍过的大树倒下了，残留的烟雾升腾而起。“走！”她的大脑喊道，她听从了，朝着家的方向冲去。“在他们之前赶到——”",
	"Suddenly, flames burst forth, travelling at an unearthly velocity towards Leya's perch. Her perch meant the world to her, but in the vast expanse of the Wood it was small and unimportant. Too insignificant for a Perch Guard outpost of its own. Her heart tightened knowing the remote settlement wouldn't be warned in time, and that aid would not be close by.": "突然，火焰迸发，以一种超乎寻常的速度朝着莱娅的栖息地飞去。她的栖息地对她来说意义非凡，但在茂密的树林中，它显得微不足道。对于一个瞭望哨来说，它太微不足道了，无法拥有自己的前哨站。她的心紧缩，知道偏远的定居点不会及时收到警告，援助也不会很快到来。",
	"Leya's hands began to move without thought as she whispered the words of her grandmother. It wouldn't be enough, but she wouldn't be able to live with herself if she didn't try. When taught to her, the spell was meant to help farms through rainless seasons. It wasn't intended to be used defensively. Droplets of a lost cause formed between her fingers.": "莱娅的手开始不受控制地移动，她低声念着奶奶的咒语。这可能不够，但如果不尝试，她将无法面对自己。在她学习时，这个咒语是用来帮助农场度过干旱季节的。它并不是用来进行防御的。无助的水滴在她的手指间凝聚成了一种失去的希望。",
	"Conjured water fell to the ground, evaporating as soon as it hit the steaming forest floor. As she concentrated, a strong warm gust touched Leya's face. It's Altus, it must be! Leya thought. The Amaranthine of storms was bringing rain to quench this hateful wildfire. She looked to the sky, frantically searching for more signs of changing weather.": "召唤出的水滴落到地面上，一碰到冒着热气的森林地面就蒸发了。当蕾娅集中注意力时，一股温暖的强风拂过她的脸庞。这一定是阿尔图斯，一定是！蕾娅想。风暴之花正在带来雨水，以扑灭这场可恨的野火。她抬头望向天空，拼命搜索更多改变天气的迹象。",
	"Barely able to register what she saw, her arms dropped to her sides in defeat. Flying balls of fire were filling up the sky. A swarm broke off, headed in her direction. Leya sank to her knees, hoping with her last thoughts that someone would save Humblewood before it all burned.": "她几乎无法相信自己所看到的一切，她的双臂垂落在身体两侧，颓然地放弃了。火球在空中飞舞，充斥着整个天空。一群火球突然分散开来，朝她的方向飞来。莱娅跪倒在地，希望最后的思绪能够拯救(`Humblewood`)，让一切不至于付之一炬。",

	"Humblewood lies on the eastern coast of a vast continent, nestled in a valley between the towering Crest Mountains and the marshlands of the Mokk Fields. It is a mystical, secluded place that gets by quite well without much trade from the outside world, due to the fertility of the soil and an abundance of natural resources. The Wood has many skilled workers and artisans, and this, coupled with the supply of raw materials, makes Humblewood a great exporter.": "谦木（Humblewood）位于一个广阔大陆的东海岸，坐落在高耸的冠山（Crest Mountains）和莫克领地（Mokk Fields）的沼泽地之间的山谷中。这是一个神秘而幽静的地方，由于土壤肥沃且自然资源丰富，它可以很好地独立生存，不需要太多外界贸易。谦木有许多熟练的工匠和艺术家，再加上原材料的供应，使谦木成为一个出色的出口地。",
	"The Wood has a diverse population, but the true power in Humblewood are the birdfolk. At the heart of their nation lies the great capital of Alderheart.

	"There have been disturbing signs over the last few months, signalling that something is wrong in Humblewood. The troubles appear to originate from activity in the Scorched Grove, an ashen plain that was ravaged many centuries ago by a destructive fire. Whatever caused the fire has scarred the land with elemental magic, making it inhospitable to all but strange fire-based creatures. Of late, the Grove has begun to expand. At first, it was hard to notice the slow expansion, but those in tune with nature (especially the Tenders) could see the imbalance in the elemental forces of Humblewood. For many common folk, this imbalance has been experienced as unseasonal dryness, which has led to crop failure and an increased frequency of forest fires. There have also been a number of unusually aggressive emberbat clouds reported far outside of their natural ranges.": "在过去几个月里，出现了一些令人不安的迹象，表明Humblewood出现了问题。这些麻烦似乎源自焦痕林的活动，这片灰烬覆盖的平原在许多世纪前被一场毁灭性的大火摧毁。无论是什么引起了这场大火，都用元素魔法在土地上留下了伤痕，使其对除了奇怪的火系生物之外的所有生物都不适宜。最近，焦痕林开始扩张。起初，这种缓慢的扩张很难注意到，但那些与自然息息相关的人（尤其是守护者）能够看到Humblewood元素力量的不平衡。对许多普通人来说，这种不平衡表现为非常时期的干旱，导致作物歉收和森林火灾频率增加。还有一些异常具有攻击性的火焰蝙蝠群被报告出现在它们自然分布范围之外。",
	"The true nature of the danger still remains hidden from the people of the Wood. A corvum necromancer named {@creature Odwald Ebonhart|HWCS} has stirred the elemental {@creature aspect of fire|HWCS}, which has lain dormant beneath the Scorched Grove since its first burning. The aspect's energies have begun to empower fire-based creatures within the Wood. The increased range of emberbat swarms have brought fires that have expanded the Grove. Many forest-dwellers, who have been left without homes, have turned to banditry to survive. Soon the elemental incarnation will break free, and players must find a way to stop the aspect of fire before it reduces the Wood to ashes.": "真正的危险本质仍然对{@creature Odwald Ebonhart|HWCS}的Wood人民隐藏着。 一位名为{@creature Odwald Ebonhart|HWCS}的乌鸦死灵法师激发了自第一次燃烧以来一直潜伏在焦林下方的元素{@creature aspect of fire|HWCS}。 这个元素的能量已经开始增强Wood内的以火为基础的生物。 灰蝙蝠群的增加范围带来了扩大焦林的火灾。 许多居住在森林中的人，因无家可归而转向了抢劫以求生存。 很快，元素化身将会脱困，玩家必须找到一种方法来阻止火之本质在将Wood化为灰烬之前。",
	"Part 1 of the adventure is designed to start a party of 1st level characters off on their journey in the world of Humblewood. The kinds of characters players create will influence how the campaign begins.": "第一部分的冒险旨在让1级角色组在《谦木》（Humblewood）的世界中开始他们的旅程。玩家创建的角色类型将影响战役的开端。",
	"If characters are not playing races described in this book, perhaps they have heard legends of Humblewood, and have traveled or were brought here to explore the wonders of the forest. Maybe the newcomers have come to see the magnificent city of Alderheart, or to seek an audience with the Birdfolk Council. Any number of stories can be crafted about why standard 5th Edition races have ended up in the Wood, but keep in mind that they might be viewed as curiosities as they travel the land. Most folk in Humblewood haven't seen outsiders like them before.": "如果角色没有扮演本书中描述的种族，也许他们听说过《(Humblewood)谦卑森林》的传说，并前来探索森林的奇迹。也许新来的人前来看看宏伟的城市《(Alderheart)艾尔德之心》，或者寻求与《(Birdfolk Council)飞禽议会》会面。关于为什么标准第五版种族会出现在这片森林中，可以编织出许多故事，但请记住，当他们穿越这片土地时，他们可能会被视为奇特的存在。《(Humblewood)谦卑森林》的大多数居民以前从未见过像他们这样的外来者。",
	"If characters are birdfolk or humblefolk, have them start their adventure as residents of Meadowfen, a small village south of the Scorched Grove, near the main road.": "如果角色是鸟人或谦卑之民，让他们从位于焦土林南部、靠近主要道路的小村庄莲花沼泽开始他们的冒险。",
	"Meadowfen has been quiet for as long as anyone can remember, and life there goes by slowly. Recently, Meadowfen has fallen on hard times. Seasonal rainfalls haven't arrived, leaving the fields barren. To make matters worse, trade wagons sent to provide relief have gone missing, fueling rumors of bandits prowling the roadways. Fire-based creatures are venturing closer to the village than ever before. A week ago, an ominous plume of black smoke to the north blocked the sun. A few brave villagers ventured out to investigate, but they haven't returned. The source of the smoke remains unknown.": "草地沼泽（Meadowfen）已经安静了很久，生活在那里一直都很慢节奏。最近，草地沼泽陷入了困境。季节性降雨没有到来，田地变得贫瘠。更糟糕的是，前往提供救援的贸易马车失踪了，助长了有强盗潜行在道路上的传言。以火为基础的生物比以往更靠近村庄了。一周前，一股黑烟的烟柱从北方升起，遮住了太阳。一些勇敢的村民冒险外出调查，但他们至今未归。黑烟的来源仍然未知。",
	"The sleepy village of Meadowfen is the perfect home for aspiring adventurers who dream of fantastical quests across Humblewood. The recent chaos surrounding the settlement presents ample opportunity for a group of heroes to get their feet wet. Meadowfen also works well as a staging ground for new arrivals to the Wood, as there are few here who the village Elder can turn to for help in these times. It would be fortuitous if a group of travelling adventurers were to show up.": "《草原沼泽》(Meadowfen)这个宁静的村庄是那些梦想在《谦卑之林》(Humblewood)展开奇幻探险的志士们的理想家园。最近围绕着这个定居点的混乱为一群英雄提供了很好的机会来试水。草原沼泽也适合作为新来者进入这片森林的基地，因为村长可以求助的人很少。如果一群旅行中的冒险者出现将是个幸运的巧合。",
	"Wherever the journey begins, one of the locals who went to investigate the black smoke in the north will return, badly wounded and in need of aid.": "无论旅程从何处开始，前往北方调查黑烟的当地人之一将返回，受伤严重，需要援助。",
	"There is a commotion in the village square. A wounded strig woman limps towards the Meadowfen Elder's home, staggering and catching herself on the side of a well. She is bloodied, and her tawny feathers are singed and flecked with ash and soot.": "村庄广场上一片骚动。 一名受伤的(`strig`)女人一瘸一拐地朝向梅多芬(`Meadowfen`)长老的家走去，摇摇晃晃地靠在井边。 她浑身是血，淡黄色的羽毛被烧焦，布满灰烬和煤灰。",

	"If a party member does not assist her, a villager helps Cara into the Elder's house. The gallus, {@creature Ardwyn, Elder of Meadowfen|HWCS} grants entrance to Cara and the party. Many villagers will try to follow Cara, but Ardwyn will turn them away. It is clear the party was only allowed into Ardwyn's home because she wants to speak with them.": "如果一个队员不帮助她，一个村民会帮助卡拉进入长老的房子。鸡冠兽，{@creature Ardwyn, Elder of Meadowfen|HWCS} 允许卡拉和队伍进入。许多村民会试图跟随卡拉，但阿德温会把他们拒之门外。很明显，队伍之所以被允许进入阿德温的家，是因为她想和他们交谈。",
	"If any party member has proficiency in the {@skill Medicine} skill, they will be given time to tend to Cara's wounds.": "如果任何一名队伍成员精通{@skill Medicine}技能，他们将有时间照顾Cara的伤口。",
	"Impatiently, Ardwyn approaches Cara.": "急躁地，阿德温走向卡拉。",
	"\"It's clear you have endured much, my child,\" the respected gallus says, motioning to the party to gather around. \"But we must know what happened out there.\"": "“看得出你经历了很多，我的孩子，”受人尊敬的加鲁斯说道，示意队伍聚集在一起。“但我们必须知道外面发生了什么事情。”",
	"Cara explains that the fires from the Scorched Grove have spread to the hillside town of Ashbarrow and razed it to the ground. Cara warns that the roads are full of bandits. Luckily, she escaped with her life. Others, Ashbarrow citizens fleeing their burning homes, were not so lucky. Cara doesn't know where those captured by the bandits were taken.": "卡拉解释说，烧焦树林的火灾已经蔓延到山腰小镇灰炉镇，并将其夷为平地。卡拉警告说，道路上到处都是强盗。幸运的是，她成功逃脱。其他灰炉镇的居民逃离他们的燃烧家园时，并没有那么幸运。卡拉不知道那些被强盗抓走的人被带到了哪里。",
	"The Elder, understanding how serious this is, asks the party to travel to Alderheart, to speak to the Birdfolk Council and inform them of Ashbarrow's destruction and of the bandit activity on the roads near Meadowfen. The party may be the only ones who can make the dangerous journey.": "长者理解这件事有多严重，请求队伍前往奥尔德哈特，与鸟人议会交谈，告知他们阿什巴洛的毁灭以及在梅多芬附近道路上的土匪活动。队伍可能是唯一能够完成这危险旅程的人。",
	"As the party sets out from Meadowfen, four hooded figures will come into view on the road ahead.": "当队伍离开草地沼泽时，前方的道路上会出现四个戴着兜帽的人影。",
	"Three hooded figures are gesturing violently at a crumpled body on the ground, while a fourth is leaning against a nearby tree. A small hand-cart stacked high with bags and boxes of various sizes stands nearby. One of the hooded figures goes to the cart and unceremoniously sifts through the packages, leaving fallen bundles strewn on the road.": "三个戴着兜帽的人物在地上一个蜷缩的身体前猛烈地做手势，而第四个人则靠在附近的一棵树上。附近有一个小手推车，上面堆满了各种大小的袋子和盒子。其中一个戴兜帽的人走到手推车旁，毫不客气地翻找着包裹，导致路上散落着被扔下的捆绑物。",
	"As you approach the three strangers who were gesturing at the body, you can see the pointed faces of mapach under the hoods. Two male and one female mapach, each wearing worn leather armor and a short sword on their belt. The fourth, an intimidating vulpin female, is lightly armored and wears an ornate sword on her hip. She seems to be hanging back, letting her subordinates do all the work.": "当你走近那三个在指着尸体的陌生人时，你可以看到他们戴着兜帽下尖尖的(mapach)面孔。两个(mapach)男性和一个女性，每个人都穿着破旧的皮甲，腰间挂着一把短剑。第四个人是一位令人畏惧的(vulpin)女性，穿着轻甲，腰间佩戴一把华丽的剑。她似乎在后面观望，让手下的人做所有的工作。",
	"You hear a whimpered \"Help me\" from the creature laying on the road, but you can't make out their features. The mapach female, still standing near the fallen body, puts her hands on her hips and says to the party, \"All right folks, nothing to see. Move along if you know what's good for ya.\"": "你听到一声低声的“救救我”从躺在路上的生物那里传来，但你无法看清他们的特征。站在倒地身旁的(mapach)雌性，双手叉腰对着队伍说：“好了，各位，没什么好看的。如果你们知道什么对你们有好处的话，就赶紧走开吧。”",
	"The vulpin leading these three {@creature mapach bandit|HWCS|mapach bandits} is a powerful foe named {@creature Fray Merridan|HWCS}. She represents a serious threat to the party, but won't take interest in them unless she has a reason to believe the characters are a worthy challenge.": "这三只{@creature mapach bandit|HWCS|mapach bandits}中的狐人领袖是一位强大的敌人，名为(%1(Leader's name)%). 她对队伍构成严重威胁，但只有在有理由相信角色是值得挑战的对手时才会对他们感兴趣。",
	"Assuming the party doesn't want to fight, the bandits will leave if bribed. They are reasonable robbers, and will gladly relinquish the cart if the party can offer a worthy sum. Negotiations start with Fray evaluating the cart's contents. She and her crew will simply walk away for 10 gp each. Players can roll opposed Charisma ({@skill Deception}) or ({@skill Persuasion}) checks against a Wisdom check made by Fray to negotiate for a lower price, but the bandits won't leave for anything less than 5 gp each.": "假设队伍不想战斗，强盗们如果被贿赂就会离开。他们是讲理的强盗，如果队伍能提供一笔可观的钱，他们会乐意放弃这辆马车。谈判从弗雷(Fray)评估马车的内容开始。她和她的团队会每人简单地离开，只需支付10 gp。玩家可以进行对抗魅力({@skill Deception})或({@skill Persuasion})检定，与弗雷进行智力检定对抗，以谈判降低价格，但强盗们不会接受每人少于5 gp的离开。",
	"Believing they have the upper hand, the bandits won't hesitate to attack if they sense trepidation or suspect that the party might be up to something. Any threats or posturing from the characters will be met with an attack from the three mapach bandits. This fight shouldn't be too difficult, as the party likely outnumbers the bandits and are probably better equipped.": "相信他们占据上风，强盗们会毫不犹豫地发动攻击，如果他们感觉到恐惧或怀疑队伍可能在策划什么。角色们的任何威胁或装腔作势都会引发三名(`mapach`)强盗的攻击。这场战斗不应该太困难，因为队伍很可能在人数上占优势，而且装备可能更好。",
	"Fray will stay back and let the party fight the bandits for a round or two. She will intervene after two rounds or when a bandit is brought down. Fray will target the character who looks to be the most capable in single combat. If the party is larger than four players, she will engage in combat from the start, ordering her underlings to deal with the others.": "Fray（弗雷）会留在原地，让队伍与土匪战斗一两轮。在两轮之后或者有一个土匪被击倒时，她会介入战斗。Fray（弗雷）会选择看起来在单挑中最有能力的角色作为目标。如果队伍超过四名玩家，她会从一开始就参与战斗，命令手下处理其他人。",
	"Joining the fight, the bandit captain says, \"Intriguing. You look like you might actually give me a proper fight!\" The vulpin smirks and draws her blade, tracing intricate patterns in the air as she rushes into battle.": "加入战斗的土匪首领说：“有趣。你看起来似乎能给我一场真正的战斗！”狐族一边咧嘴笑着，一边拔出她的刀，随着她冲向战斗，空中划出复杂的图案。",
	"Fray is a deadly foe, but she wasn't prepared to have her heist interrupted. She won't risk her life needlessly if the odds turn against her. If at least two of the mapach bandits go down, she will make a tactical retreat into the dense forest, where she can easily disappear in the foliage. While escaping, she will swear revenge and leave any unfortunate underlings to the party's mercy.": "Fray是一个致命的敌人，但她没有准备好让她的抢劫行动被打断。如果情况对她不利，她不会不顾一切地冒险。如果至少有两名mapach强盗被击倒，她会进行战术性撤退进入茂密的森林，在那里她可以轻松地在树叶中消失。在逃跑的时候，她会发誓报仇，并把任何不幸的手下留给队伍自行处理。",
	"Failure on either the Wisdom or Dexterity check means the character has lost sight of Fray and ends the chase for that character. A character successfully chasing Fray through the woods means the party catches up with her, at which point she will surrender. If four rounds have passed since her retreat, the party has lost Fray.": "智力或敏捷检定失败意味着角色已经看不到弗雷(Fray)，并结束了对该角色的追逐。成功在树林中追逐弗雷(Fray)的角色意味着队伍赶上了她，此时她会投降。如果自她撤退以来已经过去了四轮，队伍就会失去弗雷(Fray)。",
	"Should the party choose to try and locate Fray by continuing down the road, they will arrive at a clearing where a river separates them from a dense forest on the other side. A heavy log sits with one end on riverbank and the other end in the water, preventing the party from crossing the river and chasing Fray.": "如果派对选择继续沿着道路寻找(Fray)，他们将来到一个空地，一条河将他们与对岸茂密的森林隔开。一根沉重的原木一端横跨在河岸，另一端悬在水中，阻止了派对过河追赶(Fray)。",
	"If the party continues through any forest terrain, they will need to make regular {@skill Survival} checks to avoid becoming lost in the trees. Use the {@table Appendix E: Random Encounters; Forest Encounters (Level 1-2)|HWCS|Forest Encounters} table for an especially persistent group. Make it clear that the vulpin has made her getaway, covering her tracks well enough that following her is fruitless.": "如果队伍继续穿越任何森林地形，他们需要定期进行{@skill Survival}检查，以避免在树林中迷失方向。对于一个特别顽固的团队，请使用{@table Appendix E: Random Encounters; Forest Encounters (Level 1-2)|HWCS|Forest Encounters}表格。明确指出狐族人已经成功逃脱，掩盖了自己的踪迹，追踪她是毫无意义的。",
	"If the encounter should go horribly awry, the bandits won't bother capturing the party or finishing them off. Rather, they will retreat, stealing as much from the hand-cart as they can carry. After all, the bandits aren't sure there won't be reinforcements coming to the rescue. If a player consents, their character can earn a scar from their battle with Fray in order to heighten anticipation for the rematch later.": "如果遭遇出现严重问题，土匪们不会费心去抓住队伍或者消灭他们。相反，他们会撤退，尽可能多地从手推车上偷走东西。毕竟，土匪们不确定是否会有援军前来营救。如果玩家同意，他们的角色可以在与(Fray)的战斗中留下一道伤疤，以增加之后再战时的期待。",
	"The mapach bandits are wearing worn leather armor and each one carries a poorly-kept {@item shortsword|phb|short sword}. If they are defeated and searched, the party also finds a small coin purse with 5 gp inside it.": "土狸强盗们穿着破旧的皮甲，每人携带一把保养不佳的{@item shortsword|phb|short sword}。如果他们被打败并搜查，队伍还会发现一个小钱包，里面有5 gp。",
	"{@b {@i If Fray is defeated.}} She is wearing a suit of {@item studded leather armor|phb} (obviously pilfered), and a finely crafted {@item shortsword|phb} with a rose insignia on the pommel. The sword is not magical, but it will sell for double the normal going rate of a shortsword. Any lower level bandit who sees a character wearing the sword will immediately recognize it as a captain's sword. So long as the sword is visible, all bandits of a rank lower than captain will have disadvantage on any rolls made to oppose Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) ability checks made by that character. The party will also find among Fray's possessions 10 gp, and a map which has the location of a bandit camp marked (see {@adventure Bandit Camp|HWAitW|2|taking the fight to them}).": "{@b {@i If Fray is defeated.}她穿着一套{@item studded leather armor|phb}(显然是偷来的)服装，手持一把雕花图案的{@item shortsword|phb}，剑柄上有一朵玫瑰徽章。这把剑并非魔法剑，但售价是普通短剑的两倍。任何低级土匪看到角色拿着这把剑都会立刻认出它是队长的剑。只要剑可见，所有低于队长级别的土匪在对抗角色进行魅力({@skill Intimidation})能力检定时都会有劣势。队伍在Fray的财物中还会找到10金币，以及一张标有土匪营地位置的地图(见{@adventure Bandit Camp|HWAitW|2|taking the fight to them})。",
	"After defeating or bribing the bandits, the characters can help the beaten figure lying in the road to her feet. If they don't engage with her immediately, have her grunt or whine to attract attention. If they still don't assist, the merchant eventually sits up on her own. She is {@creature Eliza Pennygleam|HWCS}, an eluran who hails from lands beyond Humblewood. It's fairly common to see eluran traders in these parts, and the merchant is happy to explain that she has traveled here to set up shop.": "在打败或贿赂了土匪之后，角色们可以帮助那个躺在路中的倒地人站起来。如果他们不立即与她交流，让她发出呻吟或哼声以吸引注意。如果他们仍然不提供帮助，商人最终会自己坐起来。她是{@creature Eliza Pennygleam|HWCS}，一位来自谦木地的艾鲁兰人。在这些地方经常能见到艾鲁兰商人，这位商人很高兴解释她是来这里开设店铺的。",
	"If the characters were defeated by the bandits, Eliza will be the one who revives them, healing each character for {@dice 2d4+2} hit points using the last of a supply of poultices from her small hand-cart. She will curse the bandits who stole from her, but will still be grateful to the party for their valiant efforts.": "如果角色被土匪打败，艾丽莎将是那个让他们复活的人，她会用她手推车上最后一点药膏为每个角色治疗{@dice 2d4+2}点生命值。她会诅咒那些偷了她东西的土匪，但仍然会感激队伍为了保护她而做出的英勇努力。",
	"\"My whiskers, that was close! Thank you all for protecting me and my cart. My name is Eliza. I'm on my way to Alderheart by way of Winnowing Reach.

	"If the characters seem reluctant to aid her, she will entice them by offering each character a single item from her cart in exchange for their protection and company on the road—to be awarded upon arrival.": "如果角色们似乎不情愿帮助她，她将通过向每个角色提供一件物品来诱使他们，以换取他们在路上的保护和陪伴—这些物品将在到达目的地后奖励给他们。",
	"If the party decides to walk with Eliza, their movement speed is reduced considerably as she pulls her cart behind her. A strong character can offer to pull the heavy-laden hand-cart instead. Succeeding a DC 12 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check keeps everyone moving at regular traveling speed, while failure means the party continues slowly.": "如果队伍决定跟随艾丽莎（Eliza）步行，他们的移动速度会大大降低，因为她在身后拉着手推车。一个强壮的角色可以提出来拉这辆装满货物的手推车。成功通过一次 DC 12 力量检定（{@skill Athletics}）可以让大家保持正常的行进速度，而失败意味着队伍继续缓慢前行。",
	"The road to Winnowing Reach keeps the party just out of reach of the swamplands on the right.": "通往（Winnowing Reach）的道路让队伍始终保持在右侧的沼泽地边缘。",
	"As you make your way down the road, terrain on the left side changes considerably. Beyond the lush green trees lining the road, glimpses of burned stumps and ash-covered fields can be seen. It looks as if a massive fire recently ravaged this place.": "当你沿着道路前行时，左侧的地形发生了显著变化。在道路两侧郁郁葱葱的绿树之外，可以看到被烧毁的树桩和被灰烬覆盖的田野的一瞥。看起来好像是一场大火最近肆虐了这个地方。",
	"This bleak landscape seems to stretch for miles. While looking out over this gray scene, the characters may notice a cloud of creatures flying above the ash. Those who keep an eye on the creatures, or characters with a passive perception score of 15 or higher, notice the cloud change course and begin flying toward the party.": "这片荒凉的景观似乎延伸了几英里。当俯瞰这片灰色的景象时，人物们可能会注意到一群生物飞过灰烬上空。那些留意这些生物的人，或者被动感知分数达到15或更高的人物，会注意到这群生物改变航线，开始朝着队伍飞来。",
	"A swarm draws near. You can see it is composed of hundreds of tiny flying creatures, each one resembling a bat with a candle-sized flame sprouting from above its upturned nostrils. The combined heat of their bodies can be felt on the wind.": "一群虫群正在接近。你可以看到它由数百只微小的飞行生物组成，每一只都像一只蝙蝠，头顶长着烛光大小的火焰。它们身体散发的热量可以在风中感受到。",
	"If the cloud's course change was noticed, the characters have about 10 seconds before the bats descend on them. If the bats flew unnoticed until this point, they arrive so swiftly that the characters do not have time to prepare for the attack.": "如果注意到了云的航线变化，角色们在蝙蝠降临之前大约有10秒的时间。如果蝙蝠在这一点之前飞行而不被注意到，它们飞来得如此迅速，以至于角色们没有时间为攻击做准备。",
	"The characters are beset by two {@creature swarm of emberbats|HWCS|swarms of emberbats}. The bats dive and harass their targets relentlessly until the bats are slain or the party is defeated. The swarm won't give chase for long, and can be escaped if the party is able to put considerable distance between themselves and the ashy plain.": "角色们被两只蝙蝠{@creature swarm of emberbats|HWCS|swarms of emberbats}困扰着。蝙蝠们不断地俯冲和骚扰他们的目标，直到蝙蝠被杀死或者队伍被击败。蝙蝠群不会长时间追赶，如果队伍能够与灰色平原之间保持相当的距离，就可以逃脱。",
	"With the flaming bats behind the party, the rest of the trip is uneventful. After a couple hours on the road, the village of Winnowing Reach comes into view.": "在队伍身后的燃烧蝙蝠，之后的旅程都很平静。在路上几个小时后，温诺温格村庄出现在视野中。",
	"Entering the Reach, Eliza thanks the party and tells them that she will set up in the center of town to see what she can sell or trade.": "进入疆域，伊莉莎感谢队伍，并告诉他们她会在镇中心安排摊位，看看能卖些什么或进行交易。",
	"\"Have a rest,\" Eliza says. \"You are going to need it for when you escort me to Alderheart.\" She winks.": "\"休息一下吧，\" 伊莉莎说道。\"你将需要精神饱满，因为你要护送我去阿尔德哈特 (Alderheart)。\" 她眨了眨眼。",
	"If Eliza promised the characters an item for accompanying her to Winnowing Reach, they can claim that now. Each player can choose a piece of adventuring gear worth 50 gp or fewer as a reward.": "如果Eliza承诺给角色们一个物品作为陪同她前往Winnowing Reach的奖励，他们现在可以领取了。每位玩家可以选择一件价值不超过50 gp的冒险装备作为奖励。",
	"\"Come find me when you are ready to head north,\" she calls out as she walks away.": "“当你准备好往北走的时候，来找我吧。”她走开时喊道。",
	"Characters are free to explore Winnowing Reach, though they will find the amenities of this research station to be lacking compared to other settlements of its size. There is a general store and a small inn with a tavern, but instead of staples like a weapon or armorsmith, the town has an apothecary and a bookbinder. The following numbered locations refer to Fig.1.1: the map of Winnowing Reach.": "角色可以自由探索筛选之地，尽管他们会发现这个研究站的设施与其规模相比有所欠缺。这个小镇有一家杂货店和一家带有酒馆的小旅馆，但与武器或铠甲铁匠这样的基本设施不同，这里有一家药剂师店和一家装订书籍的店。以下编号的地点指的是筛选之地地图1.1：（Winnowing Reach）的地图。",
	"This large building houses slime residue, which will eventually be exported across the Wood, as well as collected foodstuffs from nearby farms. It is a hub of activity, with laborers moving about constantly under the watchful eye of Winnowing Reach's town militia.": "这座大楼存放着史莱姆残留物，这些残留物最终将被输出到伍德（Wood）各地，同时也收集了附近农场的食物。这里是一个充满活力的中心，劳动者们在温诺温（Winnowing Reach）镇民兵的密切监视下不断忙碌着。",
	"As it is not a large settlement, Winnowing Reach has only a small gaol. Looked after by a {@creature birdfolk guard|HWCS} who commands the small local militia, it's usually empty. If the party has any captive bandits in tow, this gaol should hold them until a wagon from Alderheart arrives to bring outlaws to the capital for sentencing.": "由于Winnowing Reach不是一个大型定居点，因此只有一个小型监狱。由一个{@creature birdfolk guard|HWCS}负责，指挥着小型的地方民兵，通常是空的。如果队伍带着任何被俘的土匪，这个监狱应该把他们关押起来，直到来自Alderheart的马车到达，将这些逃犯送到首都接受审判。",
	"A stately building in the center of town serves as the official chambers for the local magistrate. Two {@creature birdfolk militia|HWCS} guard the stairway that leads up to the platform upon which the building rests. Entry to this building is generally denied unless it is for official business (in response to a summons by the magistrate, for example).": "镇中心的一座宏伟建筑是当地法官的官方议事厅。两名卫兵{@creature birdfolk militia|HWCS}守卫着通往建筑物底座上平台的楼梯。一般情况下，除非是因为官方业务（例如回应法官的传票），否则不允许进入这座建筑物。",
	"Although she isn't particularly well-stocked at the moment, Eliza's cart contains a variety of wares available for barter or trade. Eliza has an odd assortment of equipment from the Weapons, Tools, Adventuring Gear, and Trade Goods sections of the Core Rules. Rather than determining what she has in her cart ahead of time, whenever a character wishes to purchase an item from her, roll a {@dice d6}. If the result is an even number, she has such an item with her, while if the result is odd, she does not. Eliza is interested in expanding her wares, and will accept a trade for an item of greater value instead of payment in gold pieces.": "尽管目前她的存货不是很充足，埃丽莎的手推车里装满了各种可供交换或贸易的商品。埃丽莎的手推车里有来自《核心规则》的武器、工具、冒险装备和贸易品等各种奇特的装备。与其提前确定她手推车里有什么，不如在角色想要购买物品时进行投掷骰子{@dice d6}。如果结果是偶数，她就有这样的物品，如果结果是奇数，她就没有。埃丽莎有兴趣扩大她的商品种类，并且愿意接受以更高价值的物品作为支付，而不是金币。",
	"The apothecary has {@item potion of healing|dmg|potions of healing}, {@item healer's kit|phb|healer's kits}, and {@item herbalism kit|phb|herbalism kits} for sale. They also sell swamp herbs, philters, and other raw materials, which can be used to make potions of healing. It costs half the price of a completed potion to buy enough reagents to craft one. Any character proficient with an herbalism kit can craft a potion.": "药剂师有{@item potion of healing|dmg|potions of healing}、{@item healer's kit|phb|healer's kits}和{@item herbalism kit|phb|herbalism kits}出售。他们还出售沼泽草药、过滤器和其他原材料，这些可以用来制作治疗药水。购买足够的原料来制作一瓶药水的成本是一瓶成品药水的一半。任何熟练使用草药工具的角色都可以制作药水。",
	"The bookbinder has a small library of assorted tomes to offer, and a few strange books may be found among the modest collection. Books can be purchased for 1 gp each. Some books may confer an advantage on the next Intelligence check made to see what a character knows about a creature, object, or location when read, depending on their subject matter.": "裱书匠有一小库各种书籍可供选择，其中可能有一些奇怪的书籍藏在这个不起眼的收藏中。每本书的售价为1金币。一些书籍在阅读后可能会在下次进行有关生物、物品或地点的智力检定时提供优势，具体取决于它们的主题。",
	"The local inn and tavern here in the Reach is a quiet place with quality rooms and decent food. The innkeep receives quite a few visitors from the Avium, along with the occasional adventurer looking to try their hand at slime wrangling. Treat the Wrangler's Rest as a Modest Inn.": "在这里的达拉斯地区，当地的客栈和酒馆是一个安静的地方，拥有优质的客房和不错的食物。客栈老板经常接待来自阿维姆的访客，偶尔也会有冒险者前来尝试捕捉史莱姆。把驯兽师之憩视为一家普通客栈。",
	"At some point during the party's stay, word of the adventurers reaches the Magistrate, the ranking political figure in Winnowing Reach. He eventually tracks the party down and implores them to help find a missing researcher. He fears the lost researcher has entered the Mokkden Caverns to conduct hazardous research.": "在派对期间的某个时候，冒险者的事迹传到了《(Winnowing Reach)》的最高政治人物，即总督的耳中。最终，他找到了这支队伍，并请求他们帮忙找到一位失踪的研究员。他担心这位失踪的研究员已经进入了《(Mokkden Caverns)》进行危险的研究。",
	"A young corvum researcher looking to make a name for herself has recently gone missing. The Magistrate investigated her office, and learned she had been studying the nearby slimes in order to understand their physiology. Attempting to get live samples, she has ventured to the nearby caverns which are known to be infested with several species of slimes.": "一位年轻的乌鸦人研究员，希望能够扬名立万，最近神秘失踪了。执法官调查了她的办公室，发现她一直在研究附近的史莱姆，以便了解它们的生理特征。为了获得活体样本，她冒险前往附近据说被几种史莱姆寄生的洞穴。",
	"The town's magistrate, {@creature Walden Krane, Magistrate of Winnowing Reach|HWCS}, petitions the characters to find the researcher, a young woman named {@creature Kenna Brightspark|HWCS}.": "镇长{@creature Walden Krane, Magistrate of Winnowing Reach|HWCS}请求角色们找到那位名叫{@creature Kenna Brightspark|HWCS}的年轻女研究员。",
	"Once the party is properly rested, the Magistrate will approach them.": "一旦队伍充分休息，(Magistrate)大法官会接近他们。",
	"If the party declines, the Magistrate can offer to use his position to get the party an audience with the Birdfolk Council in Alderheart. Certainly, they don't think the Council will just see just anyone, do they? Walden can write a letter of introduction to help the party get an audience, but he makes it clear he won't consider this until he is certain Kenna is safe. Should the party agree, Walden will express his gratitude, adding:": "如果队伍拒绝，(Magistrate)法官可以提议利用他的职位来安排队伍与(Alderheart)艾尔德哈特的(Birdfolk Council)飞禽族议会见面。当然，他们不会认为议会会见任何人，对吧？(Walden)沃尔登可以写一封介绍信来帮助队伍获得会面的机会，但他明确表示在确保(Kenna)肯娜安全之前不会考虑这一点。如果队伍同意，沃尔登会表达他的感激之情，补充道：",
	"\"Oh, and if along your way, you just so happen to reduce the local slime population, the Reach would be grateful for your service...\" Somewhat unconvincingly, Walden adds, \"Of course, Kenna's safety comes first.\"": "“哦，如果在你的路上，你碰巧减少了当地史莱姆的数量，(The Reach)会对你的服务表示感激……”沃尔登有些不太确信地补充道，“当然，(Kenna)的安全是第一位的。”",
	"For the service of killing a few slimes, the Magistrate also promises five gold pieces to each character.": "为了杀死几只史莱姆，总督还向每个角色承诺五个金币。",
	"If the party opts to find Kenna, the Magistrate will provide a rough map of Mokk Fields that has the entrances to the Mokkden Caverns marked.": "如果队伍选择找到肯娜，法官会提供一份莫克田野的粗略地图，上面标记了通往莫克洞穴的入口。",
	"The Mokkden Caverns are a network of caves and tunnels with several entrances dotting the Mokk Fields. The closest entrance to the Reach is located about half a day's hike south-west, in the middle of the swamp. Alternatively, there is a road that leads around the swamp to the south, arriving at another entrance at the very southwest edge of the swamp.": "莫克丹洞穴是一个洞穴和隧道网络，有几个入口点缀在莫克原野上。最靠近达拉达(Daladra)的入口位于向西南大约半天徒步路程的地方，在沼泽的中心。另外，有一条道路绕过沼泽通往南边，抵达另一个入口，位于沼泽西南边缘。",
	"This is a longer route, most likely requiring a night of camping along the road, but it is safer than the swamp. The outside of the rocky caves are visible against the backdrop of the sunken Mokk Fields, though tall reeds and dead trees provide barriers to sight. The entrances can be spotted through the marsh from about 80 feet away.": "这是一条更长的路线，很可能需要沿途露营一晚，但比起沼泽来说更安全。岩洞的外部在日落的莫克草原的背景下可见，尽管高高的芦苇和枯树提供了视线的障碍。从大约80英尺的距离就可以通过沼泽看到入口。",
	"Along the way, the party might run into bandits, or swamp creatures who want to make a meal of them. Decide what feels right for pacing and difficulty and add in an extra encounter here to ratchet up the action. Refer to the {@table Appendix E: Random Encounters; Swamp Encounters (Level 1)|HWCS|Swamp Encounters} table for suggestions.": "一路上，冒险队可能会遇到强盗，或者想要把他们当成一顿大餐的沼泽生物。决定什么对于节奏和难度来说是合适的，并在这里增加一个额外的遭遇来加剧行动。参考{@table Appendix E: Random Encounters; Swamp Encounters (Level 1)|HWCS|Swamp Encounters}表格中的建议。",
	"The inside of the caverns are dark, damp, and dank. It is evident that the murky waters of the surrounding swamp have inundated the system of tunnels beneath. Water drips from the glistening ceilings and gathers in pools throughout the caverns, filling the subterranean area with the harsh smell of rot. Tunnels descend gradually into the ground, curving gently back and forth as they go. The Mokkden Caverns are vast and largely uncharted.": "洞穴内部昏暗、潮湿、阴冷。很明显周围沼泽的混浊水已经淹没了地下隧道系统。水滴从闪闪发光的天花板上滴落，并在整个洞穴中形成水池，填满地下区域的刺鼻腐烂气味。隧道逐渐向地下延伸，弯曲地来回穿行。莫克登洞穴广阔而大部分未被探索。",
	"The cave interior is dimly lit at best, with most of the natural light provided by glowing fungi that grows in the humid environment. Ceilings in the tunnels are about 10 feet high but can drop low enough in some places that Medium characters will need to hunch. Many of the open areas have ceilings that are 15 feet high unless otherwise specified.": "洞穴内部光线昏暗，大部分自然光来自在潮湿环境中生长的发光真菌。隧道的天花板大约有10英尺高，但在一些地方可能会降低到需要中等身材角色弯腰的高度。许多开阔区域的天花板高度为15英尺，除非另有规定。",
	"The journey through the caverns can be made more difficult by incorporating difficult terrain. It can take the form of areas water-logged by the swamp seeping in or areas made slippery by dripping water and organic muck. While navigating slippery areas at more than half speed, a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw is required to avoid tripping and falling {@condition prone}.": "穿越洞穴的旅程可能因为加入困难地形而变得更加艰难。这种地形可能是被沼泽渗入的水浸泡的区域，也可能是因滴水和有机淤泥而变得滑溜的区域。在以半速以上穿越滑溜区域时，需要进行一次 DC 13 的敏捷豁免才能避免绊倒摔倒 {@condition prone}。",
	"The slimes encountered within don't attack with reason or tactics. They lash out at the nearest target and attack until that target is subdued, even when assailed by multiple characters at the same time.": "在其中遇到的史莱姆不会根据理性或战术进行攻击。它们会向最近的目标发起攻击，并持续攻击直到目标被制服，即使同时受到多名角色的攻击也是如此。",
	"The closer entrance to the Mokkden Caverns juts out obviously from the surrounding mire. Be sure to roll on the {@table Appendix E: Random Encounters; Swamp Encounters (Level 1)|HWCS|Swamp Encounters} table as the party approaches. They are taking a dangerous route through the swamp, and will likely run into trouble. When the party arrives, there are two {@creature sticky slime|HWCS|sticky slimes} burbling about in front of this entrance.": "莫克登洞穴（Mokkden Caverns）的入口突出于周围的泥潭之中，显而易见。当队伍接近时，请务必在{@table Appendix E: Random Encounters; Swamp Encounters (Level 1)|HWCS|Swamp Encounters}表上投骰。他们正沿着沼泽中的危险路线前行，很可能会遇到麻烦。当队伍到达时，有两只{@creature sticky slime|HWCS|sticky slimes}在这个入口前咕噜着。",
	"The farther entrance can be spotted just as the forest gives way to marshlands. This cave opening has two {@creature caustic slime|HWCS|caustic slimes} in front of it, wading through the fen looking for prey. This route will take the party longer to reach, but is safe enough that they shouldn't encounter anything else on the way.": "当森林让位给沼泽地时，远处的入口就能被发现。这个洞穴入口前有两只{@creature caustic slime|HWCS|caustic slimes}，它们在沼泽中徘徊，寻找猎物。这条路线会让队伍花费更长时间到达，但足够安全，他们在路上不应该会遇到其他任何事物。",
	"The slimes are ostensibly combat encounters, but any character can make a DC 12 {@skill Perception} check as they approach, easily spotting the slimes from 80 feet away on a success. On a failure the character does not notice the slimes until they are within 60 feet. If the party enters the range of the slime's {@sense blindsight} (60 feet), the slime will attack. If the party can spot the slimes before then, they can attempt to pick the slimes off with ranged weapons and spells (treat the slimes as though they are {@condition blinded} if they are attacked beyond their {@sense blindsight} radius).": "这些史莱姆表面上是战斗遭遇，但任何角色在接近时都可以进行一次 DC 12 {@skill Perception} 检定，成功的话可以轻松地从80英尺外发现史莱姆。如果失败，角色直到距离60英尺内才会注意到史莱姆。如果队伍进入史莱姆的射程范围（60英尺），史莱姆会发动攻击。如果队伍能在此之前发现史莱姆，他们可以尝试用远程武器和法术清除史莱姆（如果史莱姆在其{@sense blindsight}范围之外被攻击，则将其视为{@condition blinded}）。",
	"Other methods, such as luring the slimes away with a distraction, or using stealth to slip by unnoticed, can also work. So long as the party didn't bumble into a slime's {@sense blindsight} range, the party can avoid either encounter by succeeding on a DC 14 group Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check. If at least half of the party members succeed, they make it by quietly.": "其他方法，比如用诱饵引开史莱姆，或者悄无声息地溜过去，也是可行的。只要队伍没有不慎闯入史莱姆的{@sense blindsight}范围，队伍可以通过一个DC 14的团体敏捷检定来避免遭遇。如果至少一半的队员成功通过检定，他们就可以悄悄地通过。",
	"Despite being dangerous, the slimes are slow and easy to outrun, so be sure to let the party know that they can make a break for the entrance if they're spotted. The slimes will give up the chase a few rounds after the party moves outside of their {@sense blindsight} range.": "尽管史莱姆很危险，但它们移动缓慢，容易甩开，所以一旦被发现，一定要告诉队伍他们可以冲向入口。史莱姆会在队伍移出它们{@sense blindsight}范围几个回合后放弃追击。",
	"If the party defeats the slimes they will find 15 silver pieces undigested inside the creatures.": "如果队伍打败了史莱姆，他们会在这些生物体内找到15个未消化的银币。",
	"After about 30 minutes of walking in the caves, the party stumbles upon a 50-foot-long tunnel. It appears to be the only way forward, but seems dangerous to say the least.": "在洞穴里走了大约30分钟后，队伍发现了一条长50英尺的隧道。这似乎是唯一的前进道路，但至少看起来很危险。",
	"You look down the tunnel in front of you. It is haphazardly propped up by makeshift frame made from wooden struts. The timeworn frame creaks audibly, and dust occasionally showers down from the ceiling into the tunnel. It looks like it could collapse at any moment.": "你朝着面前的隧道望去。它被用木支架搭建而成，支撑得有些杂乱无章。那陈旧的支架发出明显的吱吱声，时不时有灰尘从天花板上落下。看起来随时都可能倒塌。",
	"The first researchers created supports to shore up hazardous rocks on the tunnel ceiling that threatened to collapse. In the years since, the struts have largely been ignored.

	"{@b {@i Determine weak spots in the structure.}} After a minute of observation, characters can determine weak spots in the structure. Striking these with a series of three hits against AC 10 with ranged weapons or spells will trigger the collapse.": "{@b {@i Determine weak spots in the structure.}} 观察一分钟后，角色可以确定结构中的薄弱点。用远程武器或法术对AC 10进行三次连续攻击，就会引发倒塌。",
	"{@b {@i Thunder damage.}} Any spell or ability that deals thunder damage can create enough of a shockwave to collapse the rocks.": "{@b {@i Thunder damage.}} 任何造成雷霆伤害的法术或能力都可以产生足够的冲击波来使岩石坍塌。",
	"{@b {@i A novel path forward.}} If the party is especially clever, create some ad hoc rules using the above as guidelines.": "{@b {@i A novel path forward.}} 如果团队特别聪明，可以根据以上准则制定一些临时规则。",
	"Once the struts have collapsed, characters will need to navigate the debris-strewn ground (treat as difficult terrain) but will otherwise be fine.": "一旦支柱坍塌，角色们将需要穿越布满碎片的地面（视为艰难地形），但除此之外他们将会安然无恙。",
	"Conversely, characters can attempt to go through the tunnel carefully. With a successful DC 14 group Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check, they can move through without disturbing the boulders. On a failure, their movement will trigger a small collapse. Characters must then make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 4 ({@dice 1d8}) points of bludgeoning damage from falling debris. Consider replacing the damage with a level of {@condition exhaustion} if it deals too much damage to the party. Treat the collapsed tunnel as difficult terrain.": "相反地，角色可以尝试小心地穿过隧道。通过成功的DC 14小组敏捷检定({@skill Stealth})，他们可以在不打扰巨石的情况下通过。如果失败，他们的移动将触发一次小规模坍塌。角色随后必须进行一次DC 13敏捷豁免才能避免从落石中受到4({@dice 1d8})点钝击伤害。如果这造成对队伍来说过多伤害，考虑将伤害替换为一级{@condition exhaustion}。将坍塌的隧道视为艰难地形。",
	"After about 30 minutes of walking through the winding subterranean paths, the party arrives at a large cavern.": "经过大约30分钟的步行穿过蜿蜒的地下通道后，队伍抵达了一个巨大的洞穴。",

	"The slimes land, encircling the group. Characters looking to flee can escape either through the three exits ahead or by backtracking through the tunnel they entered from. However, the ceiling in the entrance tunnel is 10 feet high, providing ample room for slimes to follow. There, any pursuing slimes are able to move upside down on the ceiling and attack from above. Fleeing through the three exits ahead is a simple matter—slimes don't move very quickly and the party should be able to lose them in a round or two.": "史莱姆们陆续登陆，包围着小组。角色们想要逃跑的话，可以通过前方的三个出口逃离，或者沿着他们进入的隧道原路返回。然而，入口隧道的天花板有10英尺高，足够让史莱姆们跟随。在那里，任何追逐的史莱姆都能在天花板上倒挂行动，并从上方发动攻击。通过前方的三个出口逃跑很简单——史莱姆们移动速度不快，小组应该能在一两轮内甩掉它们。",

This leads to the next area.": "{@b {@i Exit 2}}- 一个15英尺高，10英尺宽的出口，用摇摇欲坠的木梁加固，以防止坍塌（就像前一次遭遇中的那个）。为了避免触发坍塌，必须以半速通过这个出口。角色可以故意引发坍塌，让岩石掉落在任何追赶的史莱姆身上。这会通往下一个区域。",
	"{@b {@i Exit 3}}–a smaller opening, about 4 feet tall and 4 feet wide. Medium or Larger creatures would need to squeeze through using half of their movement.

	"This part of the adventure introduces one of the greatest forces threatening the Wood: the Bandit Coalition, which has risen up and gained power since the fires first began to spread. The Coalition's membership is comprised mostly of humblefolk who, because of the fires, have been displaced from small villages deep in the Wood.

	"The Coalition now represents a serious threat to the Wood, owing to the leadership of a scarred cervan warrior named {@creature Benna Seridan|HWCS}. Benna's mission is one of revenge against the Birdfolk Council at Alderheart, but she also seeks to support all the forest-dwellers who were displaced by the fires, many of whom now serve in the Coalition. The party must defend Alderheart from the Bandit Coalition, and will later be asked by the Council to help strike a decisive blow against the bandit menace.": "联盟现在对木之地构成严重威胁，这要归功于一位名叫{@creature Benna Seridan|HWCS}的疤痕鹿人战士的领导。贝娜的使命是报复奥德哈特的鸟人议会，但她也寻求支持所有被火灾驱逐的森林居民，其中许多现在在联盟中服役。队伍必须保卫奥德哈特免受强盗联盟的侵袭，并随后将被议会要求帮助对强盗威胁进行决定性打击。",

	"You can have the party come up with their own solution for finding the jerbeens, but if they're stuck, advise them that asking around the market might be an easy way to locate them.

A failure will require another hour of searching before coming across someone who knows where the hideout is.": "你可以让队伍自己想办法找到杰宾人，但如果他们卡住了，建议他们在市场打听可能是一个简单的定位方法。在市场打听将需要进行一次 DC 13 智力检定({@skill Investigation})，成功的话会直接引导队伍找到杰宾人的藏身之处。失败的话需要再花费一个小时搜索，直到找到知道藏身地点的人。",
	"There are four jerbeens, all of them siblings. Their parents died when their village was consumed by a forest fire, and they've been stealing to survive ever since.

	"The party can give the young thieves some gold, solving their financial problems temporarily. Any amount of gold will help them for a time: five gold pieces will provide the siblings enough security to look for honest work, while a payment of one gold piece could result in the jerbeens resorting to stealing again, once the gold runs out. In the latter situation, the characters may cross paths with the Magistrate later, at which point he will report that \"The thieves are at it again!\"": "该队伍可以给这些年轻的小偷一些金币，暂时解决他们的财务问题。任何数量的金币都会在一段时间内帮助他们：五个金币足以让这对兄妹有足够的安全感去寻找正当工作，而一金币的支付可能会导致杰宾再次诉诸偷窃，一旦金币用完。在后一种情况下，角色们可能会在之后与地方法官相遇，届时他会报告说：“小偷们又开始作案了！”",
	"The orphans can also simply be fought. If one or more of them are reduced to 0 hit points, the rest will flee. This humbling experience could result in them aligning with the bandits to survive.

	"Overseen by {@creature Bita, the Council Speaker|HWCS}, the Council is the ruling body of Humblewood. The Council has the authority to draft laws that affect the entire Wood.": "由{@creature Bita, the Council Speaker|HWCS}监督，议会是Humblewood的统治机构。议会有权草拟影响整个Wood的法律。",
	"The members of the Council will gladly hear the party out. Despite the dignity and formality with which they hold themselves, each Council member cares deeply for the people of the Wood. They will listen carefully to the woes Meadowfen is facing, and will be saddened to hear of Ashbarrow's destruction. If there are any other issues the party wishes to recount to the Council, they will hear these as well.": "议会成员将乐意倾听派对的陈述。尽管他们保持着尊严和正式，但每位议会成员都深深关心林地的居民。他们将仔细倾听梅多芬面临的困境，并对听到艾什巴洛被摧毁感到悲伤。如果派对希望向议会陈述其他问题，他们也将倾听这些问题。",
	"Use this pool of information to inform the Council's behavior:": "使用这些信息来指导议会的行为：",
	"The Council is aware of the spreading fires, but their primary concern is banditry jeopardizing the big city and essential trading hubs. The bandit ranks have swelled of late, and the Perch Guard can only be spread so thin.": "议会意识到了火势蔓延的情况，但他们的主要关注点是土匪活动危及大城市和重要贸易枢纽。最近土匪的人数急剧增加，而守望堡的卫兵却无法无处不在。",
	"The bandits have been rallied by a fearsome leader, making them bolder than ever. Little is known about this leader, but the Council has been able to corroborate that she is a ruthless cervan female, named Benna Seridan, who holds a great hatred for Alderheart.": "土匪们已经被一个可怕的领袖所带领，使他们比以往更加大胆。关于这位领袖知之甚少，但议会已经证实她是一位无情的塞尔凡雌性，名叫贝娜·塞里丹 (Benna Seridan)，对奥德哈特怀有极大的仇恨。",
	"The Council knows that Alderheart could support more refugees, but they prefer to remain cautious in these difficult times. The fires keep spreading, after all. If all the refugees are allowed to enter, how long before the city runs out of food and other essential resources?": "议会知道(Alderheart)可以支持更多难民，但他们更倾向于在这个困难时期保持谨慎。毕竟，火灾仍在蔓延。如果所有难民都被允许进入，那么城市将在多久之后耗尽食物和其他必需资源？",
	"The Council can decide to confer among themselves and meet with the party again tomorrow afternoon, to see what aid they can afford to send to Meadowfen. They assure the party that aid will be sent, but ask for their patience during these trying times. Sending a cart of supplies along bandit-ridden roads will not be easy, and any guards they send as an escort will mean less protection for the Alderites.": "议会可以决定在明天下午再次与党派会面，商讨他们能够派遣到Meadowfen的援助。他们向党派保证援助会送达，但请求在这段艰难时期保持耐心。在充斥着强盗的道路上发送一辆装满物资的马车并不容易，而派遣护卫的话会意味着对Alderites的保护减少。",
	"After the meeting with the Birdfolk Council, in the middle of the night, the following happens:": "在与鸟人议会的会议之后，在半夜，发生了以下事情：",
	"A city-wide alarm sounds, rousing the Perch Guard to their posts. Following the commotion, you see a great deal of movement around the northern entrance to Alderheart. There are shouts of \"Bandits!\" all around, and something about a merchant caravan arriving at the city.": "整个城市响起了警报，惊动了守望者们前往他们的岗位。在混乱中，你看到了在奥尔德哈特（Alderheart）北部入口周围有很多人来回奔走。四处传来“强盗！”的呼喊声，还有关于一支商队抵达城市的消息。",
	"{@b {@i If the party decides to check out the scene,}} they will arrive at a platform in front of the northernmost city gate. There they will be faced with a dismal scene: several wagons are being besieged by a massive bandit force. If the characters are armed or wearing armor, the guard captain will beseech them to help repel the bandits.": "{@b {@i If the party decides to check out the scene,}}他们将抵达北部城门前的一个平台。在那里，他们将面对一个令人沮丧的场景：几辆马车正遭到一支庞大的土匪部队的围攻。如果角色们武装或穿着盔甲，卫队队长将恳求他们帮助击退土匪。",
	"Below, a handful of bandit captains are barking orders at dozens of bandits attacking the caravans. Though the party may want to leap right into the fray, be sure to emphasize the danger involved. While ranged combat might help provide support for the sparse Perch Guard infantry, any character that throws themselves into the melee will soon be overwhelmed.": "下面，几个土匪头目正在对数十名袭击商队的土匪发号施令。尽管队伍可能想要立即投入战斗，但一定要强调其中的危险。虽然远程战斗可能有助于为稀少的(Perch Guard)步兵提供支援，但任何投入近战的角色很快就会被压倒。",
	"There are many ways characters could provide support for the sparse Perch Guard infantry. Examples include rallying the scattered Perch Guard with a heartening display, or cutting the ropes on the pulley system or freight elevators to create makeshift cover for Alderheart's forces to crouch behind. Encourage players to come up with their own creative solutions.": "有许多方法角色可以为稀少的栖卫步兵提供支援。例如，通过鼓舞人心的表现来鼓舞四散的栖卫，或者剪断滑轮系统或货运电梯上的绳索，为奥尔德哈特的部队创造临时掩护，让他们蹲在后面。鼓励玩家们想出他们自己的创意解决方案。",
	"After two or three party members have helped stem the assault, the brigands will start to flee, spilling armfuls of plundered treasure as they escape. At this point, the bandit horde will be small enough that the Perch Guard can go on the offensive, and characters can attempt to enter melee combat. If they do, have them encounter a {@creature vulpin captain|HWCS}, still trying to keep the bandit forces organized. A one-on-one fight with a character might be appropriate, but if the whole party joins in, add two {@creature mapach bandit|HWCS|mapach bandits} or a single {@creature jerbeen thief|HWCS}. The downfall of these foes marks the complete rout of the bandit forces.": "在两到三名队员帮助阻止了袭击之后，土匪们会开始逃跑，逃跑时会撒下一把把抢来的财宝。此时，土匪队伍已经变得足够小，使得栖木卫队可以转为进攻，角色可以尝试进入近战战斗。如果他们这样做了，让他们遭遇一个{@creature vulpin captain|HWCS}，仍然试图保持土匪力量的组织。一个角色进行一对一的战斗可能是合适的，但如果整个队伍加入进来，就增加两个{@creature mapach bandit|HWCS|mapach bandits}或一个{@creature jerbeen thief|HWCS}。这些敌人的失败标志着土匪力量的完全溃败。",
	"{@b {@i If no characters go into melee combat,}} the Perch Guard will run the bandits out of the city and into the Wood.": "{@b {@i If no characters go into melee combat,}）鱼鹰卫士将把土匪赶出城市，追逐至森林中。",
	"Spears, arrows, and even rocks thrown from slings rain down upon the bandit horde. Laden with the spoils of their raid, the bandits struggle to fight and begin to retreat. A victorious cry goes up along the wall, but the captain of the Perch Guard gazes down at the razed and ramshackled caravan with a look of steely determination. \"We have wounded down there,\" she exclaims, rallying the troops. \"Send for healers!\"": "长矛、箭矢，甚至从投石索中扔下的石块，如雨般落在强盗军团身上。负载着他们抢劫的战利品，强盗们挣扎着战斗，并开始撤退。城墙上响起了胜利的欢呼声，但守望卫队队长凝视着被摧毁和被抢劫的车队，眼神坚定。\"下面有受伤的人，\"她大声喊道，鼓舞士气。\"派人去找医治者!\"",
	"The bandits have taken all they can carry and fled into the northern forest. The scene left in their wake is one of broken merchant carts and wounded people. Birdfolk and humblefolk alike are injured and frightened. Characters can join in the relief effort, helping to carry the injured up the tree for treatment, or assist the shocked travelers to the safety of the canopy. A character who can provide medical aid with skills, tools, or spells may also do so.": "土匪们拿走了他们能携带的一切，逃进了北部森林。他们离开的场景是破碎的商人马车和受伤的人。鸟人和普通人都受伤和受惊。角色可以加入救援行动，帮助将受伤者抬上树治疗，或者协助受惊的旅行者前往树冠的安全地带。能够提供医疗援助的角色可以用技能、工具或法术来帮助。",
	"As the wounds of the injured are being tended, the guard captain will immediately begin organizing a counterattack, hoping to press the bandits back to their hideout and snuff out the threat for good.": "当伤员的伤口被处理时，警卫队长将立即开始组织一场反击，希望将强盗逼回他们的藏身之处，彻底消灭这个威胁。",
	"\"This cannot be allowed to continue!\" the captain shouts, swinging up on a nearby branch to make herself visible to the crowd. \"These bandits strike at our home, at our livelihood, and at our dignity as citizens of the Wood. Well, I say no more! The time has come for us to stop this menace, once and for all! Who's with me!?\"": "\"这不能继续下去了！\" 船长大喊道，一跃而上，站在附近的一根树枝上，让自己显眼地出现在人群中。“这些土匪袭击我们的家园，我们的生计，以及我们作为(木之)公民的尊严。我说不行了！现在是我们停止这种威胁的时候了，彻底解决它！谁和我一起！？\"",
	"The party should be encouraged to join the growing force of guards, militia, and common folk getting ready to leave for the bandit camp. The captain will applaud the party if they volunteer, and single them out to the jeers of the crowd if they try to refuse. Be sure that the captain advises the party to heal if they are wounded, as the bandit camp is heavily fortified and they will meet with strong resistance.": "应鼓励队伍加入日益壮大的警卫、民兵和普通百姓的队伍，他们正准备前往强盗营地。队长会对队伍的志愿者表示赞赏，并在他们试图拒绝时引起人群的嘲笑。务必让队长建议队伍在受伤时进行治疗，因为强盗营地设防严密，他们将遭遇强烈抵抗。",
	"The bandits, loaded down with stolen goods, leave an obvious trail. They have become brash and sloppy, leading the guard captain and her troops directly to their camp. The camp is a collection of canvas tents and a few hastily-constructed storehouses behind fortified palisades. There is a large central tent that appears to be for the leader of the camp. Refer to Fig. 2.3 for a map of the Bandit Camp.": "这些强盗身负着赃物，留下了明显的踪迹。他们变得鲁莽而懈怠，直接引领着警卫队长和她的部队来到他们的营地。这个营地是一组帆布帐篷和几座匆忙建造的仓库，后面是设有防御栅栏的。有一个看起来是营地领袖的大帐篷。请参考图2.3，查看强盗营地的地图。",
	"Depending on how players approach the bandit camp, have them enter at either point marked with a white \"X.\" The bandits attack in two stages, as indicated by the numbered creatures shown on the map. The diagram provides suggested positions for each stage to enter the fight. {@creature Fray Merridan|HWCS}, her wolf, and a jerbeen lieutenant are hiding in the tent, as indicated.

	"The party is joined by a number of birdfolk who are anxious to put an end to the raids. Utilize the {@creature birdfolk guard|HWCS}, {@creature birdfolk skirmisher|HWCS}, {@creature birdfolk militia|HWCS}, and {@creature birdfolk farmer|HWCS} stat blocks to fill in the fighting force. For narrative purposes, have these characters fight in the background, adding tension and color to the encounter. Some of them can join the party's fight if it looks like the characters could use help. Slot them in at the start of the round for the purposes of determining initiative.": "队伍被一群渴望结束袭击的鸟人加入。利用{@creature birdfolk guard|HWCS}、{@creature birdfolk skirmisher|HWCS}、{@creature birdfolk militia|HWCS}和{@creature birdfolk farmer|HWCS}的属性块来填充战斗力量。为了叙事目的，让这些角色在背景中战斗，增加紧张感和色彩。如果看起来角色需要帮助，其中一些可以加入队伍的战斗。在决定先攻顺序时，将他们安排在回合开始时。",
	"There is also a lone {@creature strig knight|HWCS} fighting among the Alderites. He is a mighty ally, and the party should notice him displaying his skill and prowess during the fight, perhaps even diverting the flow of battle so that the party can deal with their encounters without interference from more experienced bandits. The knight is {@creature Riffin, the Ash-Knight|HWCS}, an NPC players can choose to seek out after the battle. Whether or not a character speaks to Riffin after the battle, Riffin will join the story at a later juncture. It is advised to not have him help the party directly unless they are in dire need, as he can easily overpower any of the challenges faced here.": "在艾尔德人中也有一名孤独的{@creature strig knight|HWCS}在战斗中。他是一位强大的盟友，队伍应该注意到他在战斗中展示自己的技能和威望，甚至可能改变战斗的走向，让队伍能够应对遭遇，而不受更有经验的强盗的干扰。这位骑士是{@creature Riffin, the Ash-Knight|HWCS}，一个玩家可以选择在战斗后寻找的NPC。无论角色是否在战斗后与里芬交谈，里芬都会在以后的某个时刻加入故事。建议不让他直接帮助队伍，除非他们处于极度需要之时，因为他可以轻松地压倒这里面所面临的任何挑战。",
	"The moment the two sides meet, fighting will immediately break out between the Perch Guard and the bandits. If at any time the encounter seems too easy, add an extra {@creature mapach bandit|HWCS}.": "双方一旦相遇，鹊巢卫士和土匪之间将立即爆发战斗。如果在任何时候遭遇似乎太容易，添加额外的{@creature mapach bandit|HWCS}。",

Riffin's gallant efforts against the bandits have made him the talk of the town, and he has had many visitors since the victory.": "如果派对想要寻找灰骑士，里芬可以在木制酒旗（Wooden Flagon）找到。木制酒旗是一家位于树干市场区附近的酒馆，里芬一直住在那里。要找到他不会太难，特别是如果派对与参与袭击强盗营地的卫兵、民兵或鸟人交谈的话。里芬对抗强盗的英勇努力使他成为城里的谈资，自胜利以来他已经接待了许多访客。",
	"You see before you a small yet sturdy looking strig clad head to talon in heavy armor, sitting at the bar with a flagon of ale. He wears a shield emblazoned with a wing crest on his back and a sheathed sword on his belt. He regards you with a friendly look as you approach. \"Well, hullo, how'dya do?\"": "你看到面前坐在吧台上的一个身披沉重盔甲的小而结实的斯特里格((Strig))。他背上背着一个印有翼纹章的盾牌，腰间佩着一把插在剑鞘中的剑。当你走近时，他用友好的目光看着你。“嘿，你好，你好吗？”",
	"Riffin is friendly, and will gladly share his story. He is from Ashbarrow and was only able to escape the recent destruction of his village thanks to the help of his good friend {@creature Odwald Ebonhart|HWCS}, who brought him here. Riffin and Odwald have been adventuring buddies for a long time. The morning before the bandits raided the merchant caravan outside Alderheart's gates, Riffin awoke to find Odwald gone without a word. He was looking for his friend when the violence began, but he couldn't stand idly by while bandits attacked the city. Now that he's confirmed Odwald is no longer in Alderheart, Riffin is preparing to leave on a journey to find Odwald. He has some idea of where the old bird might've gone.": "瑞芬（Riffin）很友好，乐意分享他的故事。他来自阿什巴罗（Ashbarrow），只能逃脱最近村庄被摧毁的灾难，多亏了他的好朋友{@creature Odwald Ebonhart|HWCS}的帮助，将他带到这里。瑞芬和奥德瓦尔德（Odwald）是长久以来的冒险伙伴。就在强盗袭击奥德哈特（Alderheart）城门外商队的早晨，瑞芬醒来发现奥德瓦尔德无声无息地离开了。当暴力开始时，他正在寻找他的朋友，但他无法袖手旁观，看着强盗袭击城市。现在确认奥德瓦尔德不在奥德哈特，瑞芬正准备启程寻找奥德瓦尔德。他大致知道那只老鸟可能去了哪里。",
	"\"I owe Odwald, even if he might not accept it. Maybe it's strange, but I just know he's got himself into 'sumthin'. He needs my help. What sorta friend would I be if I abandoned him?\"": "“我欠奥德瓦尔德(Odwald)的，即使他可能不接受。也许这有点奇怪，但我知道他陷入了‘sumthin’。他需要我的帮助。如果我抛弃他，我算什么朋友呢？”",
	"Riffin will politely decline any requests from the party asking for his help in dealing with the bandits. His duty now is to his friend. If the party offers to help Riffin look for Odwald, the strig will thank them kindly, but insist that both as a knight and a friend it is his duty alone to pursue this. He knows Odwald well, and Riffin is certain he'll find his friend at one of their old haunts.": "瑞芬（Riffin）会礼貌地拒绝派对请求帮助处理强盗问题。他现在的责任是他的朋友。如果派对提出帮助瑞芬寻找奥德瓦尔德（Odwald），这只吸血鬼会很感谢他们，但坚持认为作为一名骑士和朋友，追捕奥德瓦尔德是他一个人的责任。他很了解奥德瓦尔德，瑞芬确信他会在他们以前常去的地方之一找到他的朋友。",
	"As the party leaves the tavern, Riffin will wish them luck on their travels. If the party tries to locate Riffin once they get back from the stronghold, they'll find he has already left the city.": "当队伍离开酒馆时，里芬将祝他们旅途顺利。如果队伍试图在从要塞返回后找到里芬，他们会发现他已经离开了这个城市。",
	"If the party was unsuccessful at holding an audience with the Birdfolk Council and relaying Ardwyn's message, the party may relay that message at this meeting with the Birdfolk Council (see {@adventure Audience with the Council|HWAitW|2|Audience with the Council}).": "如果队伍未能成功与鸟人议会会面并传达阿德温的信息，队伍可以在这次与鸟人议会的会议上传达那个信息（见{@adventure Audience with the Council|HWAitW|2|Audience with the Council}）。",

	"Having fled after the defeat at their forest camp, many bandits have returned to their stronghold in the Crest. This fortress is capable of withstanding a large-scale attack, and its position in the mountains makes it a dangerous location to assault. The Council has seen fit to ask the adventurers to flush out the bandit leadership once and for all, finally ridding Humblewood of their thievery and brutality. Given a major encounter would prove disastrous, the Council calls on the heroes to use their proven skills to infiltrate the fortress and dispatch the leader of the Bandit Coalition: Benna Seridan.": "在他们的森林营地遭到失败后逃离后，许多土匪已经返回到他们在(The Crest)的据点。这座堡垒能够抵御大规模的攻击，而它在山脉中的位置使得它成为一个危险的攻击地点。议会认为有必要请求冒险者们一举肃清土匪的领导，最终摆脱(Humblewood)的盗窃和暴行。鉴于一场重大冲突将会带来灾难性后果，议会呼吁英雄们利用他们已经证明的技能潜入堡垒并消灭土匪联盟的领袖：贝娜·塞里丹(Benna Seridan)。",
	"The Crest Mountains are located roughly five days away from the capital. The party must travel through the forest before they can begin their ascent of the Crest. For the sake of pacing, choose to simply start the party at the foot of the mountains. Given the importance of their mission, it's reasonable that Alderheart would send an entourage of guards to escort the party to the base of the mountain, which would provide sufficient protection to eliminate the risk of encounters.": "冠山位于首都大约五天的路程之外。队伍必须穿过森林才能开始攀登冠山。为了节奏的考虑，选择直接让队伍从山脚下开始。考虑到任务的重要性，奥尔德哈特会派遣一队护卫来护送队伍到达山脚下，这样足够的保护就能消除遭遇的风险。",

	"The crags and canyons of the Crest would be enough to deter even the most hardened explorers, and the ascent to the fortress will take time, roughly two days of travel up the steep mountain road. If the party has an escort, the escort will leave them at the base of the mountain and return to Alderheart.": "Crest（`Crest`）的悬崖峭壁足以阻挡甚至最顽强的探险者，攀登到要塞需要时间，大约两天的时间沿着陡峭的山路前行。如果队伍有护送，护送会在山脚下离开他们，然后返回到Alderheart（`Alderheart`）。",
	"Along the way, the party will need to contend with rock slides, {@creature mountain lion|HWCS|mountain lions}, and bandit patrols.": "一路上，队伍将不得不应对岩石滑坡、{@creature mountain lion|HWCS|mountain lions}，以及土匪巡逻。",
	"The mountain climb can be fast-tracked by having at least one member of the party make a DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check each day, skipping the day's encounter and potentially reaching the fortress without incident. On a failure, have the party deal with an encounter from the Mountain Road Encounters table. The paths that lead up the Crest are narrow and weave between craggy outcrops (perfect for ambushes), or along sheer cliffs (perfect for traps), but it would be appropriate to create other terrain hazards for a given encounter.": "登山可以通过派遣至少一名队伍成员每天进行一次 DC 14 智力检定({@skill Survival})来加快进度，这样可以跳过当天的遭遇，有可能顺利抵达要塞。如果检定失败，队伍将面对山路遭遇表中的一场遭遇。通往山脊的小径狭窄，穿梭在嶙峋的岩石之间（非常适合埋伏），或者沿着陡峭的悬崖（非常适合设置陷阱），但也可以根据具体遭遇情况创建其他地形危险。",

	"To maintain the secrecy and security of the fortress, the bandits regularly patrol the paths. These patrols are comprised primarily of three {@creature mapach bandit|HWCS|mapach bandits} and two {@creature jerbeen thief|HWCS|jerbeen thieves}, but if the party has been spotted by patrols at any point, add a {@creature vulpin captain|HWCS} to the encounter.": "为了保护堡垒的机密和安全，土匪们定期巡逻路径。这些巡逻队主要由三个{@creature mapach bandit|HWCS|mapach bandits}和两个{@creature jerbeen thief|HWCS|jerbeen thieves}组成，但如果队伍在任何时候被巡逻队发现，就会增加一个{@creature vulpin captain|HWCS}到遭遇中。",
	"Finally, through the mist you see a pair of great stone towers looming on the horizon. As you approach, you notice they are connected to a squat and sturdy fortress, which stands in lonely vigil among the crags. A few distant shapes can be seen patrolling the parapets, and banners with the crest of the Bandit Coalition hang proudly from the walls.": "最终，透过薄雾，你看到地平线上耸立着一对巨大的石塔。当你靠近时，你注意到它们与一座矮胖而坚固的堡垒相连，这座堡垒在峭壁间孤寂地守望着。一些遥远的身影可以看到在城垛上巡逻，悬挂着强盗联盟纹章的旗帜自豪地飘扬在墙上。",
	"Entering the fortress proper will be a challenge. It has 100-foot-high stone walls with guard posts stationed around the perimeter. Behind the perimeter, the fortress opens into a square, 120-foot-long inner courtyard consisting of barracks and training areas. A narrow wagon-road leads from the north of the courtyard to a wooden palisade with a set of double doors. Beyond that, a meeting hall has been dug into the mountain itself, and serves as the inner keep.": "进入(`Fortress Proper`)将是一个挑战。它有100英尺高的石墙，周围设有哨所。在周界后面，要进入一个长120英尺的正方形内庭，包括兵营和训练区。一条狭窄的马车道从内庭的北部通往一座木栅栏，有一扇双门。在那之后，一个会议大厅已经挖进了山体内部，作为内部要塞。",
	"Connecting the courtyard to the outside is a single large entrance on the front wall: a massive wooden door behind an iron portcullis, which can be lowered like a drawbridge for wagons. A smaller, 5-foot-wide door to the side allows for single-file entry and is guarded by two well-armored mapachs who are big for their kind. These two each use the stat block for a {@creature mapach bandit|HWCS}, but with the following changes:": "将庭院与外界连接的是前墙上的一个巨大入口：一扇厚重的木门后面是一道铁栅栏，可以像吊桥一样放下，以便马车通过。侧面有一扇较小的门，宽5英尺，只能单人排队进入，由两只身材高大的马帕奇护卫。这两只马帕奇每只使用{@creature mapach bandit|HWCS}的属性块，但有以下变化：",
	"They have 21 HP each": "他们每个人有21点生命值 (%(HP)%)。",
	"They have a Strength score of 14 (an additional +1 to attack rolls)": "他们的力量属性得分为14（攻击检定额外+1）",

	"Storming this entrance will almost certainly raise an alarm and incur attacks from the four archers walking the walls (use the stat block for a {@creature mapach bandit|HWCS}). The archers each benefit from three-quarters cover thanks to the parapets. Even though the stat block of the mapach bandit can be used for many of the least-skilled members of the camp, they come from a variety of humblefolk races. Hedges, cervans, jerbeens, and vulpins can all be found within their ranks.": "冲击这个入口几乎肯定会引起警报，并遭受四名沿着城墙走动的弓箭手的攻击（使用{@creature mapach bandit|HWCS}的属性块）。由于城垛的遮挡，这些弓箭手每人都受益于四分之三的掩护。尽管马帕奇强盗的属性块可以用于营地中许多技能最低的成员，但他们来自各种谦卑的种族。在他们的队伍中可以找到树篱人、狐鹿人、杰比人和狐狸人。",
	"There are many ways things could go badly for a party of adventurers here. If by chance they are overwhelmed by bandits, remember that Benna won't necessarily want them dead. She'll want to question them first, so the party will be placed in the fortress' prison until she's satisfied she has the answers she wants. If Benna has any reason to believe some of the characters are valuable hostages, she'll happily keep them alive in order to ransom them to the Birdfolk Council at Alderheart and continue filling the Coalition's coffers. If any of the party members are humblefolk, she might even try to convince them to join the Coalition. Birdfolk have had power in these lands for too long. If the character accepts her offer, once her plan to get revenge on the Council is complete, she'll be sure they share in the spoils.": "在这里，冒险者队伍可能会遇到很多不利情况。如果碰巧他们被强盗压倒，记住贝娜（Benna）不一定想要他们死。她会想要先询问他们，所以队伍会被关进堡垒的监狱，直到她确信得到了想要的答案。如果贝娜有任何理由相信其中一些角色是有价值的人质，她会乐意让他们活着，以便向奥尔德哈特（Alderheart）的鸟人议会索要赎金，并继续填补联盟的金库。如果队伍中有谦卑之人，她甚至可能会试图说服他们加入联盟。鸟人在这片土地上已经掌握权力太久了。如果角色接受她的提议，一旦她完成了对议会的复仇计划，她会确保他们分享战利品。",
	"If there are any humblefolk in the party, and the party managed to get their hands on bandit outfits (either by taking some with them from the bandits defeated near Alderheart or from defeated bandit patrols on their way up the mountainside), those characters can easily disguise themselves and bluff their way into the fortress. The bandit ranks have grown steadily over the last few months, and new arrivals to the fortress are common. A birdfolk can attempt to bluff their way in, but this will be a little more challenging, requiring a DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check to fool the bandits. A few \"odd birds\" have sided with the bandits, but their numbers are low enough to make the guards suspicious. Unless they are being introduced as \"prisoners\" rounded up by the humblefolk, birdfolk characters infiltrating the base will need to be careful of catching Benna's eye. They will face immediate suspicion from her if they are noticed.": "如果队伍中有任何谦逊的人，并且队伍设法弄到了强盗服装（要么是从靠近奥尔德哈特的被打败的强盗那里带走一些，要么是在上山途中击败了强盗巡逻队），那些角色可以轻松地伪装自己，以欺骗进入要塞。过去几个月，强盗的人数不断增加，要塞的新来者很常见。一只鸟人可以尝试以欺骗的方式进入，但这会更具挑战性，需要进行一次 DC 14 魅力检定（{@skill Deception}）来愚弄强盗。一些“怪鸟”已经与强盗结盟，但他们的数量不足以让卫兵产生怀疑。除非他们被介绍为被谦逊的人围捕的“囚犯”，潜入基地的鸟人角色需要小心不要引起贝娜的注意。如果被注意到，他们会立即引起她的怀疑。",
	"Any character wearing Fray's sword will have advantage on Charisma ({@skill Deception}) checks needed to enter the stronghold, as the sword denotes a captain's rank in the Coalition, and the sentries won't want to risk offending a ranking officer. While there aren't many bandits here who would recognize it as Fray's sword, any character openly wearing this weapon will need to be careful around Benna. She knows her captains well, and this will draw immediate suspicion.": "任何佩戴着Fray的剑的角色，在进入要塞所需的魅力检定中获得优势({@skill Deception})，因为这把剑象征着联盟中的一名上尉，哨兵们不愿冒犯一个高级军官。虽然这里没有多少强盗会认出这把剑是Fray的，但任何公开佩戴这把武器的角色都需要在Benna周围小心。她对自己的上尉了如指掌，这会立即引起怀疑。",
	"While the fortress walls are high, they are still surmountable with at least 100 feet of rope and a {@item grappling hook|phb}, but the party will need to approach this option with caution. Spending a few hours on a stakeout will reveal the guard patrol patterns well enough to attempt to infiltrate the fortress with advantage on the DC 15 group Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check required to avoid the sentries. Stealthier parties may be able to slip in unnoticed without such preparation.": "虽然堡垒的城墙很高，但只要有至少100英尺的绳索和一个{@item grappling hook|phb}，就可以克服，但冒险者们需要谨慎对待这个选择。花几个小时蹲守将揭示守卫巡逻的规律，足以尝试潜入堡垒并在团队敏捷度(DC 15)检定时获得优势，以避开哨兵，这是必须的{@skill Stealth}检定。更擅长潜行的冒险者可能可以在没有准备的情况下悄悄溜进去。",
	"In addition to the above options, the party could choose a number of other routes to gain entry. Below are some possible options that would open a path to Benna:": "除了上述选项外，队伍还可以选择其他几条路线来进入。以下是一些可能的选项，可以打开通往贝娜（Benna）的道路：",

	"{@b {@i Causing a scene outside the fortress or in the courtyard,}} goading Benna to come out and fight. She will accept the terms of single combat, but the party will need to abide by the results and be prepared to be taken as hostages if they lose (see {@adventure The Prison|HWAitW|2|The Prison}). If another party member attempts to interfere, she'll set the camp on them (see {@adventure Entering By Force|HWAitW|2|The Prison}).": "{@b {@i Causing a scene outside the fortress or in the courtyard,}）挑衅贝娜出来战斗。她会接受单挑的条件，但一旦输了，队伍需要遵守结果，并准备好被作为人质带走（见{@adventure The Prison|HWAitW|2|The Prison}）。如果其他队员试图干涉，她会对他们展开袭击（见{@adventure Entering By Force|HWAitW|2|The Prison}）。",
	"{@b {@i If the party stakes out the fortress,}} they'll find that wagons with stolen goods make regular shipments up to the keep. The party could create a distraction, then sneak into one of these wagons and enter the keep undetected (see {@adventure The Storeroom|HWAitW|2|The Storeroom}).": "{@b {@i If the party stakes out the fortress,}）他们会发现那些装载着赃物的马车定期运送到城堡。冒险小组可以制造一个干扰，然后潜入其中一辆马车，偷偷地进入城堡而不被发现（见{@adventure The Storeroom|HWAitW|2|The Storeroom}）。",
	"{@b {@i If characters encountered the jerbeen orphans in Alderheart, and treated them fairly,}} the orphans can turn up in the fortress as insider allies.

	"The party can always choose to simply try to fight their way into the fortress, but it isn't recommended. It might not be too hard for them to force their way past the outer walls and into the courtyard, but from there, resistance will only increase (see {@adventure Entering By Force|HWAitW|2|Entering By Force}). If the characters are getting in over their heads, have Benna appear early to fight them without having too many smaller confrontations.": "队伍可以选择试图直接冲进要塞，但并不建议这样做。他们也许可以比较容易地强行闯过外墙进入庭院，但从那里开始，抵抗只会增加（见{@adventure Entering By Force|HWAitW|2|Entering By Force}）。如果角色们感到吃力，可以让贝娜提前出现，避免过多的小冲突。",
	"The wide courtyard contains a small community of humblefolk, some wearing arms and armor, others unarmed and going about their day. There are two buildings inside the walls, as well as a narrow road leading up to the meeting hall. A few points of interest can be seen here:": "宽阔的院子里住着一群朴实的村民，有些人身穿武器和盔甲，有些人手无寸铁，忙着日常生活。墙内有两座建筑物，以及一条通往会议大厅的狭窄道路。这里有几个值得注意的地方：",

	"The building to the west of the barracks is only slightly smaller, and more barn-like. The party may see supply wagons being carted in.": "兵营西边的建筑只比较小一点，更像谷仓。队伍可能会看到供应马车被拉进来。",
	"There is a large canvas tent near the barracks. Two guards stand watch out front. A gust of wind whips up one of the side-flaps, revealing large cages inside. This is the stronghold's prison.": "军营附近有一座大帐篷。两名卫兵站在前面放哨。一阵风吹起其中一侧的帆布，露出里面的大笼子。这是要塞的监狱。",
	"Spiral stairs at the intersecting corners of each of the walls provide access to the upper levels. The pathways along the top of the wall are 5 feet wide, and provide three-quarters cover for characters firing down on targets.": "每面墙的相交角处都有螺旋楼梯，可通往上层。墙顶的路径宽5英尺，为向下射击目标的角色提供三分之二掩护。",
	"There are two large levers inside the gate. One controls the portcullis, and the other the drawbridge. The drawbridge lever can be pulled quickly, causing it to swing open. The portcullis lever drops the portcullis across the entrance. Large rope pulleys on either side are used to reset the levers.": "大门内有两个大杠杆。一个控制升降门，另一个控制吊桥。吊桥杠杆可以快速拉动，使其摆开。升降门杠杆会将升降门降下，挡住入口。两侧有大绳轮用于重置这些杠杆。",
	"There are at least a dozen bandits inside the courtyard.

	"If the party snuck in or managed to bluff their way inside, it's pretty easy to keep a low profile and explore the courtyard. Most bandits will assume they're supposed to be here, unless the party does something to draw the suspicion of the captains.

Otherwise, anyone in the nearby bunks will politely inform the party that the area is restricted.

He'll mention the characters are free to take something if they're hungry, but to let him know so he can record it in his ledger. If questioned, his attitude will be similar to that of the other bandits in the camp (see {@adventure The Art of Infiltration|HWAitW|2|The Art of Infiltration}), and he will call the guards if the party arouses his suspicion.": "在这个储藏室里找不到什么有价值的东西，里面存放着足够的食物（水果、蔬菜、腌肉和谷物），可以维持堡垒一段时间。此外还有火把、灯笼、绳子和其他一般用品。这里并没有太多的警卫，但一个戴着明亮眼镜的头发花白的老人充当着储藏室的看守。他会告诉角色们如果他们饿了可以拿点东西，但要让他知道，这样他就可以在账本上记录下来。如果被询问，他的态度会类似于营地里其他土匪的态度（见{@adventure The Art of Infiltration|HWAitW|2|The Art of Infiltration}），如果队伍引起他的怀疑，他会叫来卫兵。",

The cages are 10-foot-cubes, and have 10-foot-wide paths between them. They nearly fill the small space, leaving barely 5 feet between the gaoler and the bars. This is easily enough distance for a character to attempt to grab the keyring on the gaoler's belt, so long as the party can create a distraction to keep the gaoler occupied while they work. Grabbing the keyring from the gaoler's belt requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check, but depending on the nature of the distraction (such as if the gaoler is put to sleep) advantage may be granted on this roll.": "监狱帐篷由内部的支柱和四个固定钉支撑。帐篷的帘子可以轻松地抬起。显然，帐篷的主要功能是防止笼子进一步生锈。临时监狱的内部宽30英尺，长35英尺，白天透过帆布的光线使白天和黑夜易于区分。笼子是10英尺立方体，它们之间有10英尺宽的通道。它们几乎填满了这个小空间，使狱卒和铁栏之间仅剩下5英尺。这足够让角色尝试从狱卒腰带上拿取钥匙环，只要队伍能制造分散注意力的干扰让狱卒忙碌。从狱卒腰带上拿取钥匙环需要成功通过DC 15的敏捷检定({@skill Sleight of Hand})，但根据干扰的性质（比如狱卒被弄晕），此检定可能会获得优势。",

The Armory}），还有本娜的私人住所。这些战利品大多是被偷的，属于谦卑森林的各种商人和居民。理事会将允许队伍保留一半的财宝作为对他们服务的奖励，就像之前一样。",
	"The party will also be free to keep the {@item blade of the wood|HWCS} recovered from Benna.": "该队伍也可以自由保留从贝娜(Benna)那里找回的{@item blade of the wood|HWCS}。",
	"The party finds the following in Benna's quarters:": "在贝娜的房间里，队伍发现了以下物品：",
	"A scorched music box. It is made of varnished alderwood and inlaid with gold. When opened, a cervan dancer spins on a spring to a familiar humblefolk folk tune. Despite its condition, this rare item is worth 300 gp.": "一只烧焦的音乐盒。它是用上光的赤杨木制成，并镶有金子。打开时，一个雌鹿舞者会在弹簧上旋转，伴随着一首熟悉的谦卑民谣。尽管它的状况不佳，这件稀有物品价值300 gp。",
	"A rough map of the Crest and the peninsula to the northeast.": "一个关于(`the Crest`)和东北半岛的粗略地图。",
	"This is a major part of the story completed, as now the bandits will return to being a far less threatening force in the Wood. Ultimately there are two ways this part of the story can end: with Benna slain, or with the Council and Benna negotiating for a better outcome for the Wood's displaced humblefolk.": "这是故事的一个重要部分完成了，现在土匪们将重新成为森林中一支不那么具威胁性的力量。最终，这部分故事有两种结局：Benna 被杀，或者议会和 Benna 为森林中被迫流离失所的百姓争取更好的结果。",
	"{@b {@i If Benna was captured,}} and delivered to the Birdfolk Council as promised, the party should be made aware that the penalty for her crimes is death. Even so, there may still be hope for the characters to convince the Birdfolk Council to improve the lives of humblefolk.": "{@b {@i If Benna was captured,}在承诺的情况下交付给鸟人议会后，队伍应该知道她犯罪的惩罚是死刑。即便如此，角色们仍然有希望说服鸟人议会改善平民的生活。",
	"Either the party or Benna can plead for Benna's life and the desperate cause of humblefolk in the Wood, leading to a new directive for the Coalition; go to {@b If Benna was reasoned with}.": "无论是派对还是贝娜，都可以为贝娜的生命和森林中卑微人民的绝望事业辩护，从而为联盟制定新的指令；前往{@b If Benna was reasoned with}。",
	"If Benna can't be reasoned with and is executed, the Coalition won't be interested in peace talks; go to {@b If Benna was killed}.": "如果Benna无法被说服并被处决，联盟将不会对和平谈判感兴趣；前往{@b If Benna was killed}。",
	"{@b {@i If the Benna was reasoned with}}, the Birdfolk Council will be dismayed and angry at first. The party will need to spend some time convincing the Council of the good Benna has done, and the benefits of treating with her and her organization. It will take some heated discussion, but the Council members will consent to meeting with her provisionally. After hearing Benna's story, the Council's disposition will soften. They will agree on the need to provide aid to the humblefolk who have lost their homes to the fire.": "{@b {@i If the Benna was reasoned with}},鸟人议会起初会感到沮丧和愤怒。队伍需要花一些时间说服议会珍娜所做的好事，以及与她及其组织打交道的好处。这将需要一些激烈的讨论，但议会成员最终会同意暂时与她会面。听完珍娜的故事后，议会的态度会软化。他们将同意需要向失去家园的普通人提供援助。",
	"The Bandit Coalition will keep control of the fortress. Either Benna will retain command, or she'll support a new leader being appointed for the Coalition—this could be the characters (if they so choose), or someone selected from among Benna's captains. The Council will work with whoever leads the Coalition, provided the party (if they don't take over themselves) can vouch for the leader's good intentions and agrees to keep them in line. Spurred by a new purpose, the criminal elements of the Coalition will be put to an end, and the organization will turn into a relief network for those displaced by the fires.": "强盗联盟将继续控制这座要塞。 要么Benna将保留指挥权，要么她将支持为联盟任命一个新领导者——这可以是角色们（如果他们选择的话），或者是从Benna的队长中选出的某人。议会将与领导联盟的任何人合作，只要该党（如果他们不亲自接管）可以担保领导者的良好意图，并同意让他们服从。在新目标的推动下，联盟的犯罪分子将被终结，该组织将转变为一个为那些被火灾所驱逐的人提供救济的网络。",
	"With the Coalition's supply networks and Alderheart's resources working together, response times for relief efforts will be greatly improved. While some members of the Coalition will abandon the cause for their own gains, many will be willing to help it transition into an organization dedicated to helping fight the spreading fires and provide relief and shelter to those in need. The Birdfolk Council will release a decree: they will become the Humblewood Council, and new representatives from major humblefolk villages in the regions and within Alderheart itself will be added to their numbers, effectively giving humblefolk across the Wood a voice in governance for the first time. This significant change will take the span of the adventure to resolve, but by the end, the Humblewood Council will lead the way to a new era of unity in Humblewood. Now dedicated to peace, Benna will show her gratitude by presenting the party with the {@item blade of the wood|HWCS} she once wielded.": "随着联盟的供应网络和奥尔德哈特的资源共同合作，救援行动的响应时间将大大提高。虽然一些联盟成员会为了自身利益而放弃这个事业，但许多人愿意帮助它转变为一个致力于帮助对抗蔓延的火灾并为有需要的人提供救援和庇护的组织。鸟人议会将发布一道法令：他们将成为（谦卑森林）议会，来自该地区和奥尔德哈特本身的主要谦卑族村庄的新代表将被添加到他们的人数中，有效地让整个森林的谦卑族拥有了首次在治理中发声的机会。这一重大变化将需要整个冒险的过程来解决，但最终，（谦卑森林）议会将引领谦卑森林迈向一个新的团结时代。现在致力于和平，贝娜将通过赠送她曾经挥舞过的{@item blade of the wood|HWCS}来表达她的感激之情。",
	"Once the bandit general has been defeated, the Council will send an armed force to secure the stronghold. Should the players wish, this could become their base of operations. The Council will happily grant this boon to the party as they have proven themselves to be valuable allies and defenders of the realm. A small contingent of guards and hirelings from the Birdfolk Council will oversee the upkeep and protection of the fortress while the party is away. The Council does, however, expect the heroes to come to the aid of the realm whenever summoned to do so.": "一旦土匪将军被击败，议会将派遣一支武装部队来确保这座要塞的安全。如果玩家们愿意，这里可以成为他们的行动基地。议会将很乐意向该队授予这一恩惠，因为他们已经证明自己是这个领域宝贵的盟友和保卫者。一小队来自鸟人议会的卫兵和雇佣兵将在玩家们离开时负责要塞的维护和保护。然而，议会确实期望英雄们在被召唤时前来援助领域。",
	"Regardless of how the party dealt with this, the Alderites will remember them as the ones who saved their city by ending the threat of the Bandit Coalition. With the bandit threat halted by the party's efforts, the Council will gladly send for a contingent of Perch Guard to Meadowfen with much needed supplies. Henceforth, rumors of the party's deeds will slowly begin to spread across the realm, and soon the people of the Wood will recognize the party by their new title: the Defenders of Alderheart.": "无论派对如何处理这个问题，奥尔德赖特人都会记得他们是通过结束强盗联盟的威胁而拯救了他们的城市的人。随着强盗威胁被派对的努力制止，议会将乐意派遣一支珍宝卫队到梅多芬，带去急需的物资。从现在开始，关于派对行为的传闻将慢慢传播到整个王国，很快，伍德之民将以他们的新称号来认识派对：(艾尔德哈特)的守护者。",
	"With the Council agreeing to aid Meadowfen, and the bandit forces dealt with, the Wood is enjoying relative peace. The party is free to engage in some downtime activities. Just remember that there may be a need to increase the challenge of the encounters listed here if the party reaches level 4 before this part of the adventure.": "随着议会同意援助(Meadowfen)，匪徒势力得到处理，(the Wood) 正在享受相对的和平。队伍可以自由参与一些休闲活动。只需记住，如果队伍在冒险的这一部分之前达到4级，可能需要增加这里列出的遭遇的挑战。",
	"In this part of the story, the party will receive an urgent summons from the Council in Alderheart, who will explain that a huge creature, about which little is known, has been spotted burrowing under the ashen fields of the Scorched Grove. This is an {@creature ashsnake|HWCS}, one of many new fire-aspected creatures never before encountered in Humblewood. It was brought to life as a manifestation of the great {@creature aspect of fire|HWCS|aspect of fire's} rage.": "在故事的这一部分，队伍将收到来自阿尔德哈特议会的紧急传唤，他们会解释说，在焦枯树林的灰烬田地下发现了一只巨大的生物，关于它知之甚少。这是一个{@creature ashsnake|HWCS}，是许多在谦木之地从未遇到过的新的火属性生物之一。它被赋予生命，作为伟大{@creature aspect of fire|HWCS|aspect of fire's}的愤怒的体现。",
	"The aspect of fire has been stirring more and more since its slumber was first disturbed, and fires began ravaging the Wood. The appearance of these elemental monstrosities signals that the aspect is close to fully awakening. Worse still, the ashsnake roaming the Scorched Grove has started to make things dangerous for the Tenders.": "自从火焰的沉睡首次被打扰以来，火焰的力量一直在不断激荡，大火开始肆虐这片树林。这些元素怪物的出现预示着这种力量即将完全苏醒。更糟糕的是，在烧焦树林中游荡的火灰蛇已经开始对守护者们构成危险。",
	"Having seen the party's prowess handling the bandits, the Council has sent for them to help put an end to this strange creature. It has become clear to both the Council and the Tenders that whatever has been happening in Humblewood of late has its roots in the Scorched Grove. For the good of the realm, the party will need to go investigate.": "在见识了该队伍处理强盗的能力后，议会已经派人请他们帮助结束这个奇怪生物的威胁。对于议会和守望者来说，最近在（Humblewood）发生的一切都与（Scorched Grove）有关。为了王国的利益，该队伍需要前往调查。",
	"The Tenders (see {@book Appendix B|HWCS|6|The Tenders}) have been badly affected by the recent events in the Wood. The frequency of the fires has their organization spread thin across the forest, and the few who remain to tend the Scorched Grove itself are overwhelmed by an increase in the activity of the creatures that live there.": "最近发生在森林中的事件严重影响了招标人((see {@book Appendix B|HWCS|6|The Tenders})). 火灾的频率使得他们的组织在整个森林中变得脆弱，而留在焦土林中照料的少数人则被那里生活的生物活动增加所压倒。",
	"As the Grove has continued to spread via fires, new and disturbing reports have poured in from Tender outposts. Enormous clouds of emberbats have been seen great distances away from the Grove, and several strange creatures have manifested through the power of elemental flame in this region. Many Tenders have already lost their lives to the monstrous threats.": "随着树林（the Grove）继续通过火势蔓延，来自Tender哨站的新的令人不安的报告不断涌入。据报道，巨大的火焰蝙蝠群已经被看到飞离树林很远的地方，而几种奇怪的生物也通过元素火焰的力量在这个地区显现。许多Tenders已经因为这些怪物的威胁而失去了生命。",
	"If the party is in Alderheart, a frantic Council aide will come to find them and deliver an emergency Council summons. The official-looking letter asks the characters to appear before the Council as soon as they are able.": "如果队伍在艾尔德哈特(Alderheart)，一个慌乱的议会助手会前来找到他们，并递交一份紧急的议会传票。这封看起来很正式的信函要求角色们尽快出席议会。",
	"If the characters are currently at another location in the Wood, a tracker from Alderheart may come to call on them or deliver the urgent summons. In either case, have the date of the summons set for the next day, or the day after characters arrive in the city to give them a chance to explore.": "如果角色目前在木（Wood）的另一个地点，可能会有来自艾尔德哈特（Alderheart）的追踪者前来拜访他们或传达紧急召唤。在任一情况下，将召唤的日期设定为第二天，或者在角色抵达城市的第二天，以便给他们探索的机会。",
	"Whether or not this is actually a return depends on where characters spent their downtime: in Alderheart or elsewhere. Characters in the city are free to see the sights.": "这是否真的算是回归，取决于角色在艾尔德哈特（Alderheart）还是其他地方度过他们的空闲时间。在城市里的角色可以自由观光。",
	"{@adventure Eliza's Emporium|HWAitW|2|Eliza's Emporium}, still owned and operated by the party's favorite eluran, will be turning a good profit and might have some new wares available at your discretion.": "{@adventure Eliza's Emporium|HWAitW|2|Eliza's Emporium}, 仍由该党最喜爱的艾鲁兰经营所有，将会获得可观利润，并可能会根据您的意愿提供一些新商品。",
	"{@creature Susan of the Swamp|HWCS} is now here! She has assembled a small tent of wares in the Trunk Market, which she hopes to sell along with fortune readings. If a character wants their fortune read, it will cost a single gold piece. After taking a drop of their blood and consulting her cauldron, Susan will offer cryptic visions of a character's future. Either ad lib these or prepare them ahead of time to suit the game and the characters.": "{@creature Susan of the Swamp|HWCS}现在到了!她在树干市场搭起了一个小货摊，希望能卖掉一些商品，并提供占卜服务。如果角色想要占卜，费用是一枚金币。苏珊会取一滴他们的血，然后研究她的大锅，给角色提供关于未来的神秘视觉。可以即兴发挥这些内容，或提前准备以适应游戏和角色。",
	"Susan will still offer to make potions in exchange for reagents (see {@adventure A Witch's Debt|HWAitW|1|A Witch's Debt}), but she'll also sell a few prepared potions to fund her ongoing arcane research. Each of her potions costs 50 gp, except for {@item potion of superior healing|dmg|potions of superior healing} and {@item potion of resistance|dmg|potions of resistance}, which each cost 100 gp.

	"Alderheart will have changed since the character's foray into the Bandit Stronghold, in ways that reflect the party's choices.

	"{@b {@i If Benna was reasoned with,}} the party will see a new uniformed force around Alderheart: the Wildwood Brigade, into which the Bandit Coalition has begun to successfully transition. They specialize in quickly mobilizing across parts of the Wood the Perch Guard have trouble reaching. They have already been of great help in extinguishing fires before remote villages can be destroyed, and delivering supplies and aid to villages damaged by blazes. Many members are humblefolk, former refugees who use their knowledge of pathways under the forest canopy to get where they're needed in a short time.": "{@b {@i If Benna was reasoned with,}} 在奥德哈特周围，派对将看到一个新的统一部队：荒野旅团(Wildwood Brigade)，劫匪联盟已经成功过渡到其中。他们擅长快速在鹊巢警卫难以到达的森林地区展开机动。他们已经在扑灭偏远村庄被毁前的大火方面提供了巨大帮助，并向被大火破坏的村庄运送物资和援助。许多成员都是普通人，是以前的难民，他们利用他们对森林树冠下路径的了解，能够在短时间内到达需要的地方。",
	"The bandit stronghold in the Crest has been converted into a supply depot and fallback point for the wounded. A new headquarters is also under construction in the Canopy, near the Perch Guard's headquarters. Characters may even find Benna, or whoever was appointed the Brigade's leader, working out of a temporary office in the Canopy district. They're busy overseeing operations for the Brigade, receiving intel from the ground, and mobilizing help where it's needed. The work is challenging, and word is coming in that the situation with the fires just keeps getting worse.": "在山冠的强盗据点已经改建成为一个供应站和伤员的后方撤退点。一个新的总部也正在丛林地区建设中，靠近栖巢卫队的总部。角色甚至可能会在丛林地区的一个临时办公室里找到贝娜，或者是被任命为旅团领袖的人。他们正忙于监督旅团的行动，接收来自前线的情报，并在需要时动员援助。工作充满挑战，而有消息传来，火灾情况正在变得越来越糟。",
	"The Council chambers will now not only have the flags of the different birdfolk perches adorning it, but also several flags of the larger humblefolk settlements in the Wood. The humblefolk delegate selections for the Humblewood Council are ongoing. Many prominent figures have arisen in the political scene and are becoming more engaged in Council matters, hoping to win their own seat.": "议会大厅现在不仅会挂上不同鸟人栖息地的旗帜，还会悬挂几面更大的木屋谦民定居点的旗帜。木屋谦民代表的选拔工作正在进行中。许多杰出人物已经在政治舞台上崭露头角，并且越来越积极地参与议会事务，希望赢得自己的席位。",
	"{@b {@i If Benna was killed,}} with the defeat of their leader and the capture of their fortress, the Bandit Coalition has been broken in Humblewood, making for easier travel across the roads and an increase in the Perch Guard's ability to send aid to those affected by fires. Maintaining supply routes is still a strain however, and rumor has it conditions for humblefolk aren't much better.": "随着{@b {@i If Benna was killed,}首领的失败和堡垒的被夺取，强盗联盟在谦木地已经土崩瓦解，这使得道路上的旅行更加容易，也增加了栖木卫队向受火灾影响者提供援助的能力。然而，维持供应线仍然是一种负担，而传言称谦民的处境也没有好转。",
	"Refugees still crowd the trunk market, and more are sneaking up into the city through secret knotholes, or making their way down to the roots where there is more space. Crime is becoming a real problem in Alderheart, and while the situation is not immediately noticeable in the canopy, even relatively affluent areas in the trunk show increased Perch Guard presence and increased fear of thievery among the populace. Locals lock their doors at night, and some have begun to arm themselves, fearing the need to defend their livelihoods. Merchants are especially vocal about this, and many can be found waiting for an audience outside the Council chambers.": "难民们仍然挤满了树干市场，更多的人通过秘密的树洞潜入城市，或者前往更宽敞的树根地带。在奥尔德哈特，犯罪问题变得越来越严重，虽然在树冠中情况并不立即显著，但即使是相对富裕的地区也显示出了更多的栖木卫士存在以及民众对盗窃的恐惧增加。当地居民在晚上锁好门，一些人已经开始武装自己，担心需要捍卫自己的生计。商人们尤其对此表示担忧，许多人都在议会大厅外等候倾听。",
	"At some point during their stay in the city, the party will run into one of the Tenders speaking to a crowd in the canopy market.": "在他们在城市逗留期间的某个时候，冒险小组会遇到一位(守护者)在树冠市场与人群交谈。",
	"A frail young huden gallus stands on a crate in the market square, trying to catch the attention of the passing crowd. \"The fires are spreading more and more by the day. We need help to quell the blaze! Please, join with the Tenders and help us heal our Wood!\" As he speaks, a shy looking sable luma stands awkwardly to the side of him. No one seems to be taking much interest in the gallus' speech, and some are openly derisive.": "一个虚弱的年轻(`huden`)(`gallus`)站在市场广场的一个板条箱上，试图吸引路过的人群的注意。“火灾每天都在蔓延。我们需要帮助来扑灭大火！请加入(`Tenders`)，帮助我们治愈我们的(`Wood`)！”当他说话时，一个害羞的(`sable`)(`luma`)笨拙地站在他的一侧。似乎没有人对(`gallus`)的讲话感兴趣，一些人甚至公开嘲笑。",
	"The gallus is named {@creature Havel of the Autumn Moon|HWCS} and the luma is {@creature Tevor of the Spring Path|HWCS}. They both wear the robes of Tenders, though Havel seems to have more authority than Tevor. Havel will recognize the party as the Defenders of Alderheart, and inform them that he had a friend in the caravan attack last month who survived thanks to their efforts. He has heard of the party's deeds since they arrived in Alderheart, and will admit to a bit of jealousy. He wishes he were able to go out and help survivors of the fires across the Wood, but he is frail and lacks the fortitude to work in such conditions.": "这只公鸡被称为{@creature Havel of the Autumn Moon|HWCS}，而那只鹿马是{@creature Tevor of the Spring Path|HWCS}。他们都穿着守护者的长袍，尽管哈维尔似乎比特沃尔更有权威。哈维尔会认出洛德哈特的守护者，并告诉他们，他在上个月的商队袭击中有一个朋友幸存下来，多亏了他们的努力。自从他们抵达洛德哈特以来，他就听说过他们的事迹，并会承认有点嫉妒。他希望自己能够出去帮助树林中的火灾幸存者，但他身体虚弱，缺乏在这种条件下工作的毅力。",
	"Tevor seems incredibly nervous, and informs Havel that he wouldn't be so quick to say things like that if he'd ever been to the Scorched Grove. Tevor has been helping heal the Grove, and will relate that lately things have been very difficult for the Tenders there, with many being injured or worse due to monster activity.": "Tevor似乎异常紧张，并告诉Havel，如果他曾经去过烧焦树林，就不会那么轻率地说出那样的话。Tevor一直在帮助治愈树林，他会提到最近对那里的护卫者们来说事情变得非常困难，许多人因为怪物的活动而受伤甚至更糟。",
	"Havel will share that he'll likely see the party again soon, since he and Tevor are both due to attend the Council chambers tomorrow.": "Havel会分享他很可能很快会再次见到派对，因为他和Tevor都将在明天出席议会大厅。",
	"When the characters enter the Council chambers they are met with an unusual sight: it is filled with people! Birdfolk, humblefolk, Tenders, and even a few people from beyond the Wood have assembled here:": "当角色们进入议会大厅时，他们看到了一个不同寻常的景象：里面挤满了人！鸟人、谦卑之民、护林者，甚至还有一些来自树林之外的人聚集在这里：",
	"All those assembled clamor over each other, their pleas desperate. Some are urging for an immediate removal of all Tenders from the Grove before more lives are lost. Some are calling for a mobilization of the Perch Guard to meet the monsters head on. It seems everyone has an opinion and is fighting to be heard. Tevor and Havel are here as well, standing patiently off to the side of the rabble.": "所有聚集在一起的人争先恐后地喧嚷，他们的请求是如此迫切。有些人敦促立即将所有（Tenders）从（the Grove）撤离，以免再有人丧生。有些人呼吁动员（Perch Guard）直面怪物。似乎每个人都有自己的看法，并在争相发声。特沃尔（Tevor）和哈维尔（Havel）也在这里，耐心地站在人群的一侧。",
	"Shortly after the party enters, the familiar bright gallus seated in the middle of a long table at the front of the hall raises her feathered hand. This is {@creature Bita, the Council Speaker|HWCS}. She waits patiently as many of the gathered birdfolk notice her gesture and fall silent. The silence in the hall is almost overwhelming in its contrast to the noise that filled it moments before.": "派对进入不久后，坐在大厅前长桌中央的熟悉明亮的长尾鸡举起了她羽毛覆盖的手。这是{@creature Bita, the Council Speaker|HWCS}。她耐心等待，许多聚集在一起的鸟人注意到她的手势，纷纷安静下来。大厅里的寂静几乎让人难以承受，与刚刚充斥其中的嘈杂声形成了鲜明对比。",
	"When Bita speaks it is not with a booming voice or harsh language. The sound of command and respect permeate her every word. She addresses you and your companions simply. \"Thank you all for heeding our summons so quickly. The Wood is in great need, and many of our Tenders have already paid the dearest price to protect it. We hope you will hear our pleas and offer us your aid in this most dire of circumstances.\"": "当比塔说话时，她并不是用洪亮的声音或刻薄的语言。命令和尊重之声贯穿她的每个词语。她简单地对你和你的同伴们说道：“非常感谢你们如此迅速地响应我们的召唤。森林急需帮助，我们的许多护林者已经付出了最高代价来保护它。我们希望你们能听取我们的请求，在这最为危急的情况下提供援助。”",
	"Speaker Bita continues by describing clouds of emberbats, in larger numbers than have ever been seen. She speaks of strange fire creatures sighted in the Wood, and how they have injured many travelers. She then talks about the missing Tenders and the reports of a huge, unknown creature stalking the ash plains of the Grove. Something must be done, which is why the Council has called upon the help of the Defenders of Alderheart. Bita offers whatever information she can, but this creature is a new discovery and the Council has little to go on.": "Bita讲述了比以往任何时候都更多的燃烧蝙蝠的群体，她提到在树林中发现了奇怪的火焰生物，并且它们伤害了许多旅行者。她接着谈到了失踪的守护者们，以及有关一个巨大的未知生物潜伏在树林灰烬平原上的报告。必须采取行动，这就是为什么议会请求了奥德哈特守护者的帮助。Bita提供她所能提供的所有信息，但这种生物是一个新的发现，议会所知甚少。",
	"Tevor is called up before the head table. He was the most recent Tender to encounter the massive beast in the Grove. He recalls seeing the ash of the plains seize up, as if some-thing were burrowing through. The creature never broke the surface, so he was unable to get a good look at it. It must have grabbed his instructor, though, as Tevor saw him get sucked under the ash. Tevor ran, until he was safe on the edge of the Scorched Grove.": "特弗(Tevor)被召见到主桌前。他是最近遭遇森林中巨兽的招标人。他记得看到平原的灰烬突然凝固，仿佛有什么东西在钻过。那只生物从未冒出地面，所以他没能好好看清它。不过它一定抓住了他的导师，因为特弗看到他被灰烬吞没。特弗跑了，直到安全地躲在焦土森林的边缘。",
	"Tevor is obviously shaken after the account, but Havel places a hand on his shoulder, which seems to comfort him.": "特沃尔在听完那个故事后显然很震惊，但哈维尔伸出一只手放在他的肩膀上，似乎让他感到安慰。",
	"Tevor points out on a map where this most recent sighting took place. Bita will mention that the Grove is a dangerous place, and ask Havel to look for someone to guide the party. At first, Tevor simply raises his hand to speak. It's clear that he is conflicted and his fear is getting the better of him. Despite this, he'll firmly state that he will guide the party to where he last saw the creature. He will admit his fear, but every second they waste is a chance for it to strike again.": "泰弗在地图上指出了这最近的目击地点。碧塔会提到格罗夫是一个危险的地方，并请哈维尔找人来引导队伍。一开始，泰弗只是举手发言。很明显他感到矛盾，恐惧占据了上风。尽管如此，他会坚定地表示他会引导队伍去他最后看到那只生物的地方。他会承认自己的恐惧，但每一秒他们浪费的时间都是它再次袭击的机会。",
	"The great ashen plain that stretches across the northwest forest has come to be called the Scorched Grove. The Grove is the result of a massive forest fire known as the Great Calamity, which raged centuries ago. It left the area altered, and strongly connected to the magic of elemental fire. This barren place has remained in such a state for as long as anyone in the Wood can remember.": "延伸穿过西北森林的巨大灰色平原已经被称为焦枯树林(Scorched Grove)。这片树林是一场被称为大灾难(Great Calamity)的大规模森林火灾的结果，这场火灾发生在几个世纪前。它改变了这个地区，并与元素火的魔法密切相关。这片贫瘠之地已经保持这种状态，就像木头中的任何人所记得的那样。",
	"The story of the Calamity that has been passed down through the Tenders goes like this:": "经过传承给护卫者的灾难故事如下：",
	"\"Long ago, birdfolk thought they could stop forest fires from devastating the Wood by using powerful otherworldly magics. But the plan backfired. Their magics only fueled the flames, and the Grove was consumed. By the grace of the Amaranthine, the birdfolk were able to lull the blaze into a quiet slumber. Though the flames were contained, the act unbalanced the elemental forces of the Wood for generations. This is why only gentle magics are used to help the earth heal. With nature, the slow way is the right way.\"": "\"很久以前，鸟人们曾以为他们可以利用强大的异世界魔法阻止森林火灾摧毁(木之)森林。但计划适得其反。他们的魔法只是助长了火势，(林中)小树林被吞噬。在(不凋花)的恩典下，鸟人们设法让烈焰进入宁静的沉睡。尽管火势被控制住，这一行动却让(木之)森林的元素力量失衡了好几代。这就是为什么只有温和的魔法被用来帮助大地愈合。与自然相处，缓慢的方式才是正确的方式。\"",
	"To get to the Scorched Grove by road the party will need to head back toward Winnowing Reach, then continue west until the road nears the southern edge of the Grove. While this is the easiest path, it will take four days to arrive at the location where Tevor last saw the beast. If the party takes the long road, they are not at risk of an encounter.": "要通过道路前往烈焰树林，队伍需要返回温诺温河，然后继续向西，直到道路接近树林的南边。虽然这是最容易的路径，但需要四天才能到达特沃尔(Tevor)最后看到野兽的地点。如果队伍选择走远路，他们不会有遭遇的风险。",
	"Alternatively, the party can take a more direct approach through the forest to the northeastern edge of the Grove, very near where the beast was last spotted.": "或者，派对可以通过森林采取更直接的方法，前往（Grove）的东北边缘，就在野兽上次被发现的附近。",
	"If the party takes the direct approach, they will reach their destination in two days, but they'll likely run into some trouble. After one of the following encounters (either {@b A Cloud of Emberbats} or {@b The Flaming Specter}), the party will make good time to the location described by Tevor. Choose one of the encounters below.": "如果队伍选择直接前往，他们将在两天内到达目的地，但很可能会遇到一些麻烦。在以下两个遭遇中的一个之后（要么{@b A Cloud of Emberbats}，要么{@b The Flaming Specter}），队伍将顺利抵达Tevor描述的地点。请选择以下一个遭遇。",
	"While nearing the Scorched Grove, you begin to hear a faint sound far off in the distance. The sound quickly grows louder, and a cacophony of screeches reaches your ears before you see the source: a great cloud of emberbats is consuming the sparse forest to the north. They are still a distance away, but you can feel the combined heat of their bodies even from here. A bright and mysterious orange light can occasionally be seen shining in between them. ": "接近炎热树林时，你开始听到远处传来的微弱声音。声音迅速变大，一阵刺耳的尖叫声在你看到源头之前就已经传入耳中：一大群火焰蝙蝠正在吞噬北部稀疏的森林。它们还有一段距离，但你甚至可以从这里感受到它们身体散发的热量。偶尔可以看到明亮而神秘的橙色光芒在它们之间闪耀。",
	"Tevor will try to sound calm as he advises against rushing in blindly, but it's clear that he's frightened of this swarming mass of emberbats. He'll support the party however he can while maintaining a safe distance.": "Tevor会试图保持冷静，建议不要盲目冲进去，但很明显他对这群火蝙蝠感到害怕。他会尽力支持队伍，同时保持安全距离。",
	"The emberbat cloud takes up the space of a Huge creature, and it has 103 hit points and resistance to slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage. It also has the following properties:": "灰燃蝙蝠云占据了一个巨型生物的空间，它有103点生命值，并对斩击、钝击和穿刺伤害具有抗性。它还具有以下特性：",
	"It can fly at a speed of 30 feet per round and it begins 60 feet away from the party.": "它可以以每回合30英尺的速度飞行，并且距离队伍60英尺远。",
	"The heat generated by the emberbats is so intense that any creature within 30 feet must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw when they enter this area, or start their turn inside of it, taking 4 ({@dice 1d8}) points of fire damage on a failure.": "灰蝙蝠(emberbats)产生的热量如此强烈，以至于在30英尺范围内的任何生物进入此区域或在其中开始他们的回合时，必须进行一次DC 13的体质豁免才能避免受到4({@dice 1d8})点火焰伤害。",
	"The emberbats' space can be entered and moved through freely, but the heat inside is so intense that creatures inside this area take 7 ({@dice 2d8}) points of fire damage if they end their turn inside it.": "灰燃蝙蝠的空间可以自由进入和移动，但内部的热量是如此强烈，使得在这个区域内结束他们的回合的生物会受到7 ({@dice 2d8}) 点火焰伤害。",
	"Any creature that enters the emberbats' space will see that they are swarming around a glowing ball of molten orange energy. This orb is only a foot across and shines like a miniature sun, making it difficult to target.": "任何进入火蝙蝠们空间的生物都会看到它们围绕着一团发光的熔化橙色能量飞舞。这个球只有一英尺大小，闪耀着像一个微型太阳，使得它难以被瞄准。",
	"The orb can be attacked, and has the following properties:": "这个(orb)可以被攻击，具有以下属性：",
	"30 hit points": "30生命值",
	"Immunity to fire damage": "免疫火焰伤害 (Immunity to fire damage)",
	"Vulnerability to cold damage": "受冷伤害的脆弱性",
	"Resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage dealt by non-magical weapons": "对非魔法武器造成的钝击、砍砍和刺穿伤害的抵抗能力",
	"It is magic, and registers as conjuration magic if examined with {@spell detect magic} or a similar effect": "这是魔法，如果用{@spell detect magic}或类似效果检查，会被识别为传送魔法。",
	"Once this orb is destroyed, the cloud of emberbats will gradually disperse, taking 4 rounds to disappear completely. If the bats are killed, but the orb remains, the orb will fly off in a random direction at a speed of 60 feet per round, streaking through the forest, eventually slowing down as it attracts a new cloud of emberbats.": "一旦这个(orb)被摧毁，火蝙蝠的群体将逐渐消散，需要4轮才能完全消失。如果蝙蝠被杀死，但(orb)仍然存在，(orb)将以每轮60英尺的速度朝一个随机方向飞去，在森林中飞奔，最终减速并吸引新一群火蝙蝠。",
	"Whatever type of energy the orb was, it seemed to be exciting the emberbats, driving them to cloud in large numbers. A difficult DC 17 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check will be enough for a character to ascertain similarities between this phenomena and similar instances mentioned in conjuration textbooks: when high-level conjuration circles deteriorate, such energy nodes have been observed being intermittently released.": "无论这个球体是什么类型的能量，它似乎激发了灰蝙蝠，驱使它们聚集成大群。对于一个角色来说，通过一次困难的智力检定 DC 17 ({@skill Arcana})，就足以发现这种现象与召唤类教科书中提到的类似情况之间的相似之处：当高级召唤法阵破损时，这样的能量节点就会被观察到间歇性释放。",
	"While making your way through the tranquil forest, you see what looks to be a blazing fire off in the distance. As you look at the fire, you notice the flames have taken on a birdfolk-like form, resembling a weeping corvum. It's far enough away that you could make it past without being noticed, but branches of the trees around its body are already beginning to smolder.": "当你穿过宁静的森林时，你看到远处似乎有一团熊熊大火。当你看着火焰时，你注意到火焰已经呈现出鸟人的形状，类似于一只哭泣的乌鸦(`weeping corvum`)。它离你足够远，你可以悄悄通过而不被注意，但围绕它身体的树枝已经开始冒烟。",
	"This creature is a fire specter, a memory of a former inhabitant of the Scorched Grove animated by the flames that took its life. Tevor will be able to identify the creature immediately. He'll also add that such entities are only found in the deepest parts of the Grove, and it's unheard of to see one so far from the Grove itself. The Tenders are taught to leave them be, as they will dissipate once they have fulfilled their purpose, which usually consists of re-enacting a memory from the life of the victim. Tevor will warn the party that disturbing the specter risks invoking its wrath.": "这个生物是一只火焰幽灵，是炽热树林前居民的记忆，被夺去生命的火焰所激活。特沃尔(Tevor)将能够立即识别这个生物。他还会补充说，这样的实体只存在于炽热树林最深处，很少有人看到它们远离树林本身。护林者被教导要让它们自行消散，因为它们一旦完成了使命，通常就会重新演绎受害者生命中的一个记忆。特沃尔会警告队伍，扰乱幽灵可能会招致它的愤怒。",
	"If characters interact with the specter peacefully, read this:": "如果角色与幽灵和平互动，阅读此内容：",
	"As you approach, the creature appears unaware of your presence. It is on its knees, and continues to fruitlessly grasp at something in the underbrush, only to burn any plant life it touches. With each failed attempt the creature places its head in its talons and shudders in a way that suggests weeping.": "当你靠近时，这个生物似乎没有察觉到你的存在。它跪在地上，继续徒劳地在灌木丛中抓取什么东西，却只是烧毁它触碰到的植物。每次失败的尝试后，这个生物会用爪子捂住头，颤抖着，仿佛在哭泣。",
	"The memory this creature is enacting is one of picking flowers to place at a nearby gravesite. Players must figure this out on their own. If a character examines the area, with a DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check they will be able to locate an overgrown wooden grave marker covered by reeds. The singed, desiccated bush the specter keeps reaching for matches bushes on either side of it, around which small patches of bluebells grow. Simply gathering any number of these flowers and placing them upon the grave will be enough to cause the specter to dissipate harmlessly.": "这个生物正在重现的记忆是摘花放在附近的坟墓上。玩家必须自己找出这一点。如果一个角色检查这个区域，通过一次 DC 14 智力检定（{@skill Investigation}）他们将能够找到一个被芦苇覆盖的长满杂草的木制坟墓标记。幽灵不断伸手去够的焦糊的、干燥的灌木丛周围长着两边的灌木丛，周围还有一些小片的风铃花。简单地收集任意数量的这些花并将它们放在坟墓上就足以使幽灵无害地消散。",
	"Remind the players that their time is limited, as the mere presence of the specter is causing trees and shrubs around it to smoke. Characters can attempt to quench the flames before they become true blazes, but unless they have a way to do this at range, they'll need to get within 5 feet of the fire specter. Any character that lingers too long near the specter takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) fire damage from its heat. Have characters continue to take fire damage the longer they stay in close proximity to the fire specter.": "提醒玩家，他们的时间有限，因为幽灵的存在使周围的树木和灌木冒烟。角色可以尝试扑灭火焰，防止它们变成真正的大火，但除非他们有办法远程操作，否则他们需要靠近火焰幽灵5英尺。任何逗留在幽灵附近时间过长的角色都会受到来自其炽热的热量造成的5({@dice 1d10})火焰伤害。让角色在靠近火焰幽灵时继续受到火焰伤害，时间越长伤害越大。",
	"If a player disturbs the creature in any way or attempts to harm it, it will turn and attack. The fire specter uses the stat block for a {@creature fire elemental}, but it is Medium and has only 51 hit points. The creature can be lured into a nearby clearing to prevent more fires. It will attack ferociously until it has been slain, at which point it will dissolve into smoke and ash.": "如果玩家以任何方式打扰了生物或试图伤害它，它将转身反击。火幽灵使用{@creature fire elemental}的属性块，但它是中型生物，只有51点生命值。可以将这个生物引诱到附近的空地，以防止更多火灾发生。它会凶猛地攻击，直到被杀死为止，此时它会化为烟雾和灰烬。",
	"The forest gives way to expansive plains of ash, dotted with the charred husks of petrified trees. The wind here has a heat to it, and it constantly disturbs the ashen soil. As it blows, small embers can be seen forming in the disturbed ash, glowing briefly before being swept up and fading on the wind. This place is clearly unnatural.": "森林让位给广阔的火山灰平原，点缀着石化树木的烧焦残骸。这里的风带有一种炽热的气息，不断扰动着火山灰土壤。随着风的吹拂，可以看到在被扰动的火山灰中形成小火苗，短暂地闪耀着然后被风卷起，在风中消散。这个地方显然是不自然的。",
	"Regardless of the route party took, once they arrive at the location described by Tevor they will need to locate the creature that has been preying on the Tenders. A DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check or other tracking skill is needed to follow its trail. On a failure, it takes another day of searching to catch sight of the creature. Optionally, roll on the {@table Appendix E: Random Encounters; Scorched Grove Encounters (Level 3)|HWCS|Scorched Grove Encounters} table if the party fails to find the {@creature ashsnake|HWCS}.": "无论派对选择了哪条路线，一旦他们抵达 Tevor 描述的地点，他们就需要找到一直在捕食护卫者的生物。需要进行一次 DC 15 的感知 ({@skill Survival}) 检定或其他追踪技能来跟踪它的踪迹。如果失败，需要再花一天时间搜索才能看到这个生物。如果派对找不到这个{@creature ashsnake|HWCS}，可以选择在 {@table Appendix E: Random Encounters; Scorched Grove Encounters (Level 3)|HWCS|Scorched Grove Encounters} 表上进行掷骰。",
	"To add some urgency or consequences to the player's decisions, or to complicate matters, announce that by the time they locate the ashsnake it has already found another Tender and is attacking them! Not only must the party fight the beast, they must do so while attempting to save the Tender from meeting a deadly fate.": "为了增加玩家决策的紧迫感或后果，或者让情况变得更加复杂，宣布当他们找到灰蛇(`ashsnake`)时，它已经找到了另一个护卫(`Tender`)并正在攻击他们！队伍不仅必须与野兽战斗，还必须在试图拯救护卫免于致命命运的同时进行战斗。",
	"Have combat start with the party being surprised by the ashsnake ambushing the fleeing Tender. The ashnake will burst from the ground next to the Tender as they try to escape.": "在战斗开始时，让队伍被埋伏在逃跑的（Tender）身边的灰蛇（ashnake）吓了一跳。当（Tender）试图逃跑时，灰蛇会从地面上突然冒出来。",
	"The Tender has 30 hit points and can cast the {@spell druidcraft} and {@spell spare the dying} cantrips. They have no combat ability, but they make any rolls to escape being grappled at a +2 bonus. In combat, they act directly after the ashsnake.": "这个Tender有30点生命值，可以施放{@spell druidcraft}和{@spell spare the dying}的零级咒语。他们没有战斗能力，但在试图摆脱被抓住时，他们的投掷骰获得+2的加值。在战斗中，他们会在ashsnake之后直接行动。",
	"Suddenly, you see what looks to be a disturbance in the ashen plains. Something is moving underneath the thick coating of cinders at frightening speeds, churning up burning embers on either side as it goes, before vanishing. Something is here, and it has noticed you.": "突然间，你看到灰色平原上似乎有一处骚动。有东西以惊人的速度在厚厚的煤渣覆盖下移动，两侧搅动着燃烧的余烬，然后消失了。有什么东西在这里，而且它已经注意到了你。",
	"The {@creature ashsnake|HWCS} starts hidden in the ash. The first time it attacks, read the following:": "{@creature ashsnake|HWCS} 藏在灰烬中。第一次它发动攻击时，阅读以下内容：",
	"A creature resembling a huge molten snake breaks the ashen surface with incredible force! Its scales are like charcoal, and between the scales a sinister orange glow issues from its molten core. This same glow can be seen coming from two points on the creature's head, resembling eyes, though whether or not it uses these to see is unclear. ": "一只巨大的熔岩蛇破土而出，以难以置信的力量！它的鳞片如炭，鳞片间散发着邪恶的橙色光芒，源自其炽热的核心。同样的光芒也从这只生物头部的两个点中发出，看起来像眼睛，但它是否用这些来看并不清楚。",
	"The ashsnake can feel vibrations within 60 feet of itself, and will attack if it senses movement within range of its bite or constrict attacks. If it senses the party grouping up, it will unleash its breath attack on them. If attacked from outside the range of its {@sense tremorsense|MM}, the ashnake takes an action to determine the direction from which the attack originated.": "灰蛇(ashsnake)可以感知到60英尺范围内的振动，如果它感知到咬或缠绕攻击范围内的移动，它会发起攻击。如果它感知到队伍聚集在一起，它会对他们释放吐息攻击。如果在它的{@sense tremorsense|MM}范围之外受到攻击，灰蛇会采取行动来确定攻击的方向。",
	"During the fight, the ashsnake will try to stay under the ash to protect itself, but it will come up to attack when it senses an opening. Have it burrow or surface to make the fight interesting.": "在战斗中，灰蛇将试图待在灰烬下面保护自己，但当它感觉到机会时会冒出来发动攻击。让它在地下钻来钻去或者冒出地面，让战斗变得更有趣。",
	"Here are a few points to remember:": "这里有几点需要记住：",
	"The ashsnake will generally surface near characters to try and knock them over with its eruption ability. If anyone falls {@condition prone}, they can expect to have a grab attack launched against them, or a bite attack if the creature is already grappling a character.": "灰蛇通常会在角色附近出现，试图用其喷发能力将他们击倒。如果有人倒下{@condition prone}，他们可以期待遭受一次抓取攻击，或者如果生物已经与角色缠斗，那么会进行一次咬击攻击。",
	"The ashsnake can be attacked while under the ash, although it has a bonus to its armor class (as noted in the monster's description).": "灰蛇(ashsnake)在灰尘下也可以被攻击，尽管它的护甲等级有加成（如怪物描述中所述）。",
	"The ashnake can also hide under the ash, but to do this it needs to spend an action making a Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check opposed by each character's passive perception score. While hidden in this way the ashsnake is functionally {@condition invisible}, although characters can make a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check against its initial roll once on their turn (this doesn't cost an action), determining its location on a success. Anytime the ashsnake emerges it is no longer hidden.": "灰蛇也可以藏在灰烬下面，但为了做到这一点，它需要花费一个动作进行一次敏捷度检定（{@skill Stealth}），与每个角色的被动感知分数相对抗。以这种方式隐藏时，灰蛇在功能上是隐形的（{@condition invisible}），尽管角色可以在他们的回合中对其最初的检定进行一次感知度检定（智力检定（{@skill Perception}））（这不需要花费一个动作），成功的话可以确定其位置。每当灰蛇出现时，它就不再隐藏。",
	"The ashsnake can grab characters before burrowing, and can move freely underground with a grappled character in tow. Each time a character starts their turn under the ash they need to hold their breath (which they can do for 1+ their Constitution modifier's worth of minutes before they start to suffocate). This resets every time the creature surfaces, giving the character a chance to gasp for air. If a character cannot hold their breath, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking one level of {@condition exhaustion} on a failure.": "灰蛇在钻洞前可以抓住角色，并可以带着被抓住的角色在地下自由移动。每当一个角色在灰蛇下开始他们的回合时，他们需要屏住呼吸（他们可以屏住1+他们体质调整值的分钟数，然后开始窒息）。每次生物浮出水面时都会重置，给角色一个喘息的机会。如果一个角色无法屏住呼吸，他们必须进行一次 DC 15 体质豁免检定，失败则受到 {@condition exhaustion} 一级的伤害。",
	"The ashsnake isn't very intelligent, but it understands how to hunt prey. It is drawn to loud noises and heavy movements. A party member could attempt to distract it in this way.": "灰蛇并不十分聪明，但它懂得如何猎捕猎物。它会被大声噪音和剧烈动作吸引。队伍成员可以尝试用这种方式来分散它的注意力。",
	"The ashsnake will always try to have one creature grappled while it bites, and will use its ash breath as often as it can, provided there are enough targets close together for it to hit.": "灰蛇在咬住一只生物的同时，会尽力使用其灰烬吐息，只要附近有足够多的目标可以攻击。",
	"As soon as the ashsnake is slain, the following will happen in the Grove:": "一旦灰蛇被杀死，以下事件将在（Grove）中发生：",
	"The earth shakes, nearly knocking you and your companions from your feet. All around you ashsnakes erupt through massive mounds of ash. They rear up, emitting a terrifying hiss, a sound so shrill it's as though the air were being rent. As the ashsnakes encircle you, there is a deeper rumble, less violent but full of power. The creatures hesitate for a moment, until another more powerful tremor shakes even their massive bodies. The ashsnakes flee, heading south and burrowing into the ash. The tremors continue to gain in momentum and intensity. To the north, miles away, something gigantic rises from a bed of cinders. First a hill, then a small mountain, releasing a plume of ash that blocks the sun. As the dust clouds settle, you see a huge creature made of craggy black rock and pulsing orange magma. It bellows a guttural sound unlike anything you've ever heard and begins to march toward your position.": "大地震动，几乎将你和同伴从脚下击倒。四周，火山灰蛇从巨大的火山灰丘中喷发而出。它们直立起来，发出令人恐惧的嘶嘶声，声音尖锐得仿佛空气被撕裂一般。当火山灰蛇包围着你时，有一种更深沉的隆隆声，不那么猛烈却充满力量。这些生物犹豫了一会儿，直到另一次更强烈的震动甚至震动了它们庞大的身躯。火山灰蛇逃走了，向南方逃去，钻入火山灰中。震动继续增长，变得更加强烈。在北方，数英里之外，有一些巨大的东西从火山灰床上升起。首先是一个小山丘，然后是一座小山，释放出一股遮蔽太阳的火山灰柱。当尘埃落定时，你看到一个由崎岖黑色岩石和脉动橙色岩浆构成的巨大生物。它发出一种你从未听过的喉音，开始朝着你们的位置前进。",
	"The {@creature aspect of fire|HWCS} is a primeval elemental whose very being thrums with rage. Try to avoid calling it the \"aspect of fire\" in front of your players, as this creature is currently unknown to them. If a character wants to make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check to see if they know of it, a roll of 16 or higher would be enough for them to have heard of the aspect of fire through scant tales and myths. The stories say that this creature's sole desire is to consume, heedless of the destruction it leaves in its wake. Characters would not know anything more than this.": "{@creature aspect of fire|HWCS}是一种原始元素生物，其本质充满愤怒。在玩家面前尽量避免称其为\"火之化身\"，因为这种生物对他们来说是未知的。如果一个角色想要进行智力({@skill Arcana})检定来了解它，那么投掷16或更高的点数就足以让他们通过零星传说和神话听说过火之化身。传说说这种生物的唯一欲望是吞噬，不顾其所留下的破坏。角色不会知道更多信息。",
	"The aspect will immediately sense the party of intruders in its Grove, and make for them at full speed. It's obvious from the size and power of this creature that taking it on would be folly. Be sure to communicate this to the players. However, any party member who stays to make a noble sacrifice will surely buy time for their companions to escape.": "这位守护者会立刻察觉到入侵者在它的(Grove)中，全速冲向他们。从这个生物的体型和力量来看，与它交战是愚蠢的。一定要向玩家传达这一点。然而，任何留下来做出高贵牺牲的队伍成员肯定会为他们的同伴争取逃跑的时间。",
	"The party can make whatever plans they want, but the shortest distance out of the aspect's path is back into the forest toward Alderheart. Any other path out of the Grove would leave them exposed to the aspect's march or ashsnakes that could be following. The forest canopy should also provide some cover from the creature, making the party difficult to target.": "队伍可以制定任何计划，但离开元素之路最短的路径是返回森林，朝着奥尔德哈特(Alderheart)的方向。从树林出去的其他路径会让他们暴露在元素的行进路线或可能跟踪的灰蛇之下。森林树冠也应该为队伍提供一些掩护，使得它们难以成为怪物的目标。",
	"Tevor will flee immediately into the forest, making his escape before the party can react. This is the simplest way to resolve the matter, but if it makes sense within the story, you can have Tevor sacrifice himself to buy the party time to escape, or to save a party member in the following chase sequence.": "Tevor会立即逃入森林，在派对做出反应之前成功逃脱。这是解决问题的最简单方式，但如果在故事中有意义的话，你可以让Tevor牺牲自己来为派对争取逃跑时间，或在接下来的追逐过程中拯救一个派对成员。",
	"Have the players describe how they would make their way to safety. The easiest way to resolve this would be to have each character make a DC 14 Strength or Dexterity ({@skill Athletics}) check to attempt to outrun the aspect. Allow players to make different ability checks if they can come up with a unique way for their characters to escape the threat. For example, distracting the creature might be somewhat of a challenge, requiring a DC 14 Charisma or Intelligence ({@skill Deception}) check, but attempting to restrain it would be more difficult.": "让玩家描述他们如何寻找安全之路。最简单的解决方法是让每个角色进行一次DC 14的力量或敏捷检定({@skill Athletics})，尝试甩开这个威胁。如果玩家能想出独特的逃脱方式，可以让他们进行不同的属性检定。例如，引开生物的注意可能有一定难度，需要进行一次DC 14的魅力或智力检定({@skill Deception})，但试图制服它则更加困难。",
	"Once they have succeeded on the first skill check, have each player make another skill check to determine how successful they are at fleeing as the creature continues to move toward them. Make this check easier or harder depending on how well players did on the first check. If players succeed at this check, their character flees at a sufficiently quick pace to avoid being in range of the creature's attacks. Particularly dire failures on this check could result in characters falling {@condition prone}.": "一旦他们在第一个技能检定中成功，让每位玩家再进行一次技能检定，以确定他们在逃离时的成功程度，因为生物继续向他们移动。根据玩家在第一个检定中的表现，可以让这次检定变得更容易或更困难。如果玩家在这次检定中成功，他们的角色以足够快的速度逃离，避免被生物的攻击范围内。在这次检定中特别糟糕的失败可能导致角色摔倒{@condition prone}。",
	"As the aspect marches, it indiscriminately hurls massive boulders of magma and rock into the forest. Characters who failed the second skill check have fallen behind and are in range of these attacks. They must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw at the start of each round. On a failure, they take 16 ({@dice 3d10}) fire damage. On a success, they take half that damage. They may then attempt another skill or ability check to flee out of the creature's range. As above, be flexible here, and try to reward players for creativity while keeping the threat to their characters believable.": "随着元素的行进，它毫不区分地将巨大的岩浆和岩石投向森林。未通过第二次技能检定的角色已经落后，处于这些攻击的范围内。他们必须在每个回合开始时进行一次 DC 15 的敏捷豁免检定。如果失败，他们会受到 16 ({@dice 3d10}) 火焰伤害。如果成功，他们只会受到一半伤害。然后他们可以尝试另一个技能或能力检定来逃离生物的攻击范围。在这里要灵活一些，并尝试奖励玩家的创造力，同时保持对他们角色的威胁可信。",
	"After about two rounds of pursuit, the characters should notice that the aspect isn't gaining as quickly, and after another round the characters will all have made it out of the creature's range regardless. If any look back, all they will see is an ominous red glow through the trees, and a plume of thick smoke rising up over the horizon. From here the characters are free to make their way safely into the forest and back to Alderheart.": "经过大约两轮的追逐，角色们应该注意到这个怪物并没有那么快地追上来，再过一轮，角色们都会成功摆脱怪物的范围。如果有人回头看，他们只会看到树林中一道不祥的红光，以及一股浓烟从地平线上升起。从这里开始，角色们可以安全地进入森林，返回到奥德哈特(Alderheart)。",
	"A large part of the forest has been burned away in the wake of the {@creature aspect of fire|HWCS}, but it seems to have mysteriously given up chase. The party has made it back to the city safely. Having heard and felt the massive aspect's movement, the Council is eager to hear a firsthand account of what happened in the Grove.": "在{@creature aspect of fire|HWCS}的余波中，森林的大部分已经被烧毁，但它似乎神秘地停止了追击。队伍已经安全地回到了城市。听到并感受到巨大存在的移动，议会急切地想听听在林地发生了什么的第一手描述。",
	"The Council members accept the news with sadness, anger, concern, and confusion. Whatever this creature is, it represents a threat to all life in the Wood. Many elementals have resided in and around the forest for centuries, but this one harbors a rage that the Council doesn't understand.": "议会成员接受这个消息时感到悲伤、愤怒、担忧和困惑。无论这个生物是什么，它都代表着对木中所有生命的威胁。许多元素生物已经在这片森林内外居住了几个世纪，但这个生物却怀有一种议会无法理解的愤怒。",
	"A sage looking Council member will mention that she once heard tales of an elemental creature of great size and power called an aspect of fire, but that she hopes this is not the monster they face. Another Council member will mention that the first rule of battle is \"know thine enemy,\" and add that the Dean of the Avium, a sable luma named {@creature Gabe Windsworth|HWCS}, is incredibly knowledgeable. He may be able to offer some insight on the situation. Council Speaker Bita will agree, and state that should the Dean be unable to assist the party, the Avium is still home to the largest library in the Wood and its tomes may be the party's best chance at finding answers.": "一位智者般的议会成员会提到她曾经听说过一个名为火元素化身的巨大而强大的生物的传说，但她希望这不是他们所面对的怪物。另一位议会成员会提到战斗的第一法则是“知己知彼”，并补充说，阿维姆学院的院长，一位名叫{@creature Gabe Windsworth|HWCS}的黑色流明，知识渊博。他也许能够提供一些情况的见解。议会发言人碧塔会同意，并表示如果院长无法帮助队伍，阿维姆仍然拥有木之最大图书馆，其中的典籍可能是队伍找到答案的最佳机会。",
	"The Council is interested in any information that can be found regarding this creature. More than that, they would welcome a means of defeating it. In the meantime, they will begin to rally the Perch Guard in case Alderheart should come under threat. The party must now embark on a quest to stop this monster, before it consumes the land.": "议会对任何关于这个生物的信息感兴趣。更重要的是，他们希望找到一种击败它的方法。与此同时，他们将开始召集守望塔卫士，以防艾尔德之心受到威胁。队伍现在必须开始进行任务，阻止这个怪物，以免它吞噬这片土地。",
	"Thick plumes of smoke from the massive blaze the party outran can be seen from Alderheart's canopy, and news of both the awoken creature and the destruction it has wrought spreads through the whole city quickly.": "从津津有味的树冠中可以看到巨大火灾产生的浓烟，关于被唤醒的生物和它所造成的破坏的消息迅速传遍整个城市。",
	"If Tevor led the party, and returned with them, he will be granted the rank of Summerblossom for his valor. He will head up the effort to quell the forest fires the aspect has started. If he did not return, Havel will lead the relief effort, drawing on the memory of his friend to inspire the crowd, and Tevor will be given a solemn funeral. Either way, many volunteers, both humblefolk and birdfolk, will sign up to help quell the still-raging flames and assist those injured in the blaze. The party can choose whether or not they wish to aid in this effort, but nobody will begrudge them if they need to rest after their ordeal.": "如果特弗(Tevor)领导了队伍，并与他们一起返回，他将因其英勇行为被授予夏花(Summerblossom)的头衔。他将主导努力扑灭那位（aspect）引发的森林大火。如果他没有返回，哈维尔(Havel)将领导救援行动，借助他朋友的记忆来激励人群，而特弗将被给予庄严的葬礼。无论哪种情况，许多志愿者，包括普通人和鸟人，都将报名帮助扑灭仍在肆虐的火焰，并协助那些在火灾中受伤的人。队伍可以选择是否愿意参与这一努力，但如果他们需要在经历了折磨后休息，没有人会责怪他们。",
	"The party will be given a special requisition from the Council to aid in fulfilling their mission to stop the creature. Characters will be able to use this unassuming piece of parchment, stamped with the seal of Alderheart, to requisition up to 500 gp worth of equipment from any shop in the city. This can be used in separate stores, or all at the same place. Likewise, it can be used to pay for a portion of an item, such as a weapon or piece of armor, with the rest needing to be paid in coin.": "该队伍将收到理事会的特别要求，以帮助完成他们阻止那个生物的任务。角色们可以使用这张印有奥德哈特(Alderheart)印章的不起眼的羊皮纸，从城市中的任何商店申请总值高达500 gp的装备。这可以在不同的商店使用，也可以在同一地点使用。同样，它可以用来支付物品的一部分，比如武器或盔甲，其余部分需要用硬币支付。",
	"In order to obtain this discount players must explain how the requisitioned goods will aid them in their mission. Some shopkeepers may require more convincing than others.": "为了获得这个折扣，玩家必须解释被征用的商品将如何帮助他们完成任务。一些店主可能需要比其他人更多的说服。",
	"The requisition is stamped on the back by a merchant each time it is redeemed, and notarized with the amount it was used for. This can be altered with a difficult skill check using a {@item forgery kit|phb}. However, modifying the document constitutes thievery, and any character caught doing this will be arrested and brought before the Council to face punishment.": "每次兑现时，申请书都会在背面由商人盖章，并在上面注明使用的金额。可以使用{@item forgery kit|phb}进行困难技能检定来篡改这个。然而，修改文件属于盗窃行为，任何被抓到的角色都将被逮捕并被带到议会面对惩罚。",
	"Characters will also be rewarded with a {@item feathered helm|HWCS} from the Tenders for their good work. If Tevor awards characters this item, it will come with a gallus feather, given by Havel, to thank the party for helping Tevor return safely.": "角色们也会因为表现出色而获得来自招标者的{@item feathered helm|HWCS}奖励。如果 Tevor 授予角色们这个物品，它将附带一根由 Havel 给予的鸡冠羽毛，以感谢队伍帮助 Tevor 安全返回。",
	"If Tevor died, have Havel gift them the helm instead. It will contain a luma feather in memory of his lost friend. If the optional variant {@b Paying the Price|HWCS|3|Reaching the Grove} was used for the ashsnake encounter, the Tender the party saved may award them the helm, fitted with an appropriate feather.": "如果特弗(Tevor)死了，让哈维尔(Havel)送给他们头盔。头盔里会放一根露玛羽毛，以纪念他失去的朋友。如果在灰蛇(ashsnake)遭遇中使用了可选变体{@b Paying the Price|HWCS|3|Reaching the Grove}，那么被救的护卫(Tender)可能会奖励他们这顶头盔，并配上一根合适的羽毛。",

	"Now that the {@creature aspect of fire|HWCS} has awoken from its long slumber, it's only a matter of time before it fully replenishes. Once it does, the aspect will surely have enough power to reduce all of Humblewood to ashes.": "现在{@creature aspect of fire|HWCS}已经从长久的沉睡中苏醒，它只需要一点时间就能完全恢复。一旦它恢复，这个力量将足以将整个Humblewood化为灰烬。",
	"The seal which kept the aspect of fire sleeping beneath the Grove was broken by a corvum mage named {@creature Odwald Ebonhart|HWCS}. Odwald deeply regrets his actions and blames himself for the spreading wildfires. In his desperation, he has returned to the Avium, where he was once a student, and disguised himself as a librarian in order to access its resources. Out of fear for what might befall the Wood if the aspect is not stopped, Odwald has begun to secretly research the darkest of necromancies. He created a monstrous undead creature known as a {@creature cobblefright|HWCS}, which he hopes will provide him with the key to stopping the elemental menace once and for all. In so doing, Odwald has placed the Avium in grave danger, for his control of the monster is imperfect. Strange occurrences on campus have aroused the suspicions of a few students and professors that something isn't quite right at the Avium. While the Dean, {@creature Gabe Windsworth|HWCS}, doesn't yet have any concrete information, he's hoping the party will be able to investigate and help him uncover the mystery. This will lead the way to Odwald and his dangerous scheme.": "在{@creature Odwald Ebonhart|HWCS}的指引下，打破了将火之本质封印在树林下的印章。奥德瓦尔德深感懊悔，并因引发的野火而责备自己。在绝望之际，他回到了曾经就读的阿维姆学院，并假扮成图书管理员，以获取资源。出于对木林可能遭受的灾难的恐惧，奥德瓦尔德开始秘密研究最黑暗的死灵术。他创造了一个名为{@creature cobblefright|HWCS}的巨大不死生物，希望这将为他提供制止元素威胁的关键。然而，奥德瓦尔德对这个怪物的控制并不完美，这使得阿维姆处于严重危险之中。校园里发生的奇怪事件引起了一些学生和教授的怀疑，他们觉得阿维姆似乎不太对劲。尽管院长{@creature Gabe Windsworth|HWCS}目前还没有确凿的信息，但他希望冒险者能够调查并帮助揭开这个谜团。这将引领他们找到奥德瓦尔德和他危险的计划。",
	"Be sure to allow the party some downtime after the events of {@adventure Part 3: An Urgent Summons|HWAitW|3} to prepare for the journey to the Avium. The aspect of fire poses a great danger to the Wood, but there's still a good amount of time to deal with the situation. If players feel pressed, have a messenger approach them with a missive from the Council, stating that the aspect hasn't moved from Scorched Grove, according to information obtained from the Alderheart observatory. Scholars cannot make any concrete predictions, but many theorize that the creature may need to remain near an area that is closely tied to elemental fire magic.": "在{@adventure Part 3: An Urgent Summons|HWAitW|3}事件之后，一定要给队伍一些休整时间，准备前往阿维姆的旅程。火焰的元素对森林构成了巨大的危险，但还有足够的时间来处理这种情况。如果玩家感到压力，可以让一个使者向他们传达议会的信息，说明根据奥德哈特天文台获取的信息，这个元素还停留在烧焦树林。学者们无法做出具体的预测，但许多人推测这个生物可能需要留在与火焰魔法紧密相关的地区附近。",
	"The Avium lies to the east of Alderheart. From special observation platforms in the city, the gigantic floating structures of the mage college can be seen rising above the trees of the forest. The College isn't terribly far, but the roadway curves around the eastern forest in order to avoid the dangers which lurk there. This part of Humblewood is known to be a nesting ground for {@creature forest prowler|HWCS|forest prowlers}, deadly predatory cats that grow leaves and vines on their fur to better blend with their surroundings.": "阿尔德哈特（Alderheart）的东部是阿维姆（Avium）。从城市中的特殊观察平台上，可以看到巨大的魔法学院漂浮在森林树木上方。学院并不是很远，但道路会绕过东部森林，以避开潜伏在那里的危险。这部分的谦木（Humblewood）被认为是{@creature forest prowler|HWCS|forest prowlers}的筑巢地，这些致命的掠食猫会在它们的皮毛上长出叶子和藤蔓，以更好地融入周围环境。",
	"Taking the road poses less risk, but it will cost the party three days of travel to reach the Avium. The path through the forest is much more dangerous and harder to navigate, but if the party moves quickly they can cut down their time, making it to the Avium in about two days.": "选择走公路风险较小，但将耗费队伍三天时间才能到达 (Avium)。穿过森林的路径更加危险且难以导航，但如果队伍快速行动，他们可以缩短时间，在大约两天内到达 (Avium)。",
	"If the party takes the long road around the forest, there are a few ways to handle this. The first and easiest way is to skip to them arriving at the Avium after an uneventful journey. This is useful for speeding up the pace of the game, or if players are itching to get to the next story beat. Be sure to mention things they encountered along the way to provide additional context:": "如果队伍选择绕过森林走远路，有几种处理方法。第一种也是最简单的方法是直接跳过他们在一段平静旅程后抵达(Avium)。这有助于加快游戏节奏，或者如果玩家们迫不及待地想要进入下一个故事情节。一定要提到沿途他们遇到的事物，以提供额外的背景信息：",
	"If the Bandit Coalition was crushed, Humblewood will have an increased presence of Perch Guard forces. The party might see merchant caravans carrying supplies from Brackenmill being escorted by Perch Guard lancers known as \"The Spears.\" Perhaps some of the Perch Guard will even be hauling Bandit Coalition prisoners who managed to escape the fortress back to Alderheart for trial and sentencing.": "如果强盗联盟被击溃，(Humblewood)将会增加(Perch Guard)部队的存在。队伍可能会看到从(Brackenmill)运送供应品的商队，由被称为“长矛”的(Perch Guard)枪骑兵护送。也许一些(Perch Guard)甚至会押送一些设法逃离堡垒的强盗联盟囚犯返回(Alderheart)接受审判和判决。",
	"If the Bandit Coalition has started to transition into the Wildwood Brigade, the party might see intrepid groups of ex-bandits turned rangers. These individuals may be helping escort supply trains and refugees to prepared camps where food, shelter, and medical supplies are available. It seems like everyone is doing their part to keep the Wood together in these trying times.": "如果强盗联盟已经开始转变为荒野旅团，冒险小组可能会看到勇敢的前强盗转变成游侠的小队。这些人可能正在帮助护送供应列车和难民到准备好的营地，那里提供食物、住所和医疗用品。在这个艰难时期，似乎每个人都在尽自己的一份力量，保持着木林的团结。",
	"If the party enjoys travel time and random adventures on the road, use the {@table Appendix E: Random Encounters; Forest Encounters (Level 1-2)|HWCS|Forest Encounters} table to decide what they encounter. For each day of travel, roll a {@dice d20}, and on a roll of 5 or lower, roll on the encounter table to see what happens. Some of these fights might be easy for a party of level 4 adventurers, so more enemies can be added to provide a greater challenge.": "如果队伍喜欢旅行和在路上随机冒险，可以使用{@table Appendix E: Random Encounters; Forest Encounters (Level 1-2)|HWCS|Forest Encounters}表来决定他们遇到什么。每天旅行时，投掷一个{@dice d20}，如果投掷结果为5或更低，则在遭遇表上投掷，看看会发生什么。对于4级冒险者队伍来说，一些战斗可能会很容易，因此可以增加更多敌人以提供更大的挑战。",
	"Not every bandit shares Benna's idealism. A few bad seeds will either use her death as an opportunity to promote themselves, or they'll balk at the idea of a reformed Coalition and splinter off into disparate groups. Use this optional encounter to add danger to the route, and help illustrate the new threats that have risen in the wake of the Coalition's destruction or transformation.": "并非每个土匪都和贝娜(Benna)一样理想主义。少数败类要么会利用她的死亡作为宣传自己的机会，要么会对改革后的联盟持反对态度并分裂成不同的小团体。利用这个可选遭遇来增加路线上的危险，并帮助说明在联盟被摧毁或转变后出现的新威胁。",
	"These new bandits are no better than raiders, and they prey on humblefolk and birdfolk alike. Among the strongest are forces led by a mapach known as {@creature Krall, the Scavenger King|HWCS}. After hearing news of the party traveling through his territory, Krall is interested in cementing his reputation among the remaining raider factions by taking down the adventurers who either killed or turned Benna.": "这些新的土匪和掠夺者一样糟糕，他们对普通人和鸟人都毫不留情。其中最强大的势力由一位名为{@creature Krall, the Scavenger King|HWCS}的(mapach)领导。在听说队伍穿越他领地的消息后，克拉尔有兴趣巩固自己在剩余掠夺者派系中的声誉，通过击败那些杀死或转变贝娜的冒险者。",

	"As the party approaches Krall's trap, the forest seems eerily quiet. Something is amiss. The bandits are well-hidden in the dark undergrowth, so rather than using passive perception, have each character make a DC 16 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to spot the ambush. If anyone fails this check, they will spend their first round surprised. Read the following:": "当队伍接近克拉尔(Krall)的陷阱时，森林显得异常安静。似乎有什么不对劲。强盗们藏身在黑暗的灌木丛中，因此不要使用被动感知，让每个角色进行一次DC 16的智力检定({@skill Perception})来发现伏击。如果有人未通过这次检定，他们将在第一回合中被偷袭。读出以下内容：",
	"You see a burly mapach with matted fur, missing in patches, sitting on the road ahead, casually picking his teeth with a long, pointed dagger. He wears studded leather armor and has a rapier sheathed at his hip. He eyes you maliciously as you approach, standing to reveal that he is nearly six feet tall. \"Well well, if it isn't Alderheart's lackeys.\"": "你看到一只浑身长满蓬乱毛发、有些地方掉毛的强壮浣熊，坐在前方的路上，随意地用一把长长的尖刀剔牙。他穿着铆钉皮甲，腰间别着一把细剑。当你走近时，他恶意地盯着你，站起身来，露出他将近六英尺高的身材。“嘿嘿，看看是不是奥尔德哈特(Alderheart)的走狗们。”",
	"Krall immediately attacks with his force. The thief supports him in melee combat while his priest and the two mapach bandits stay in the forest and attack the party at range. Krall will order Shyla to heal him if he is wounded, but otherwise she is free to attack using her own judgement, and support the bandits with her spells as needed.": "克拉尔立即发动攻击。小偷在近战中支援他，而他的牧师和两个马帕奇强盗留在森林里，远程攻击队伍。如果克拉尔受伤，他会命令希拉为他治疗，但除此之外，她可以根据自己的判断自由攻击，并根据需要用她的法术支援强盗。",
	"The dense forest provides a half cover bonus to anyone within it, and creatures there can hide as an action on their turn.": "茂密的森林为其中的任何人提供半遮蔽加值，并且那里的生物可以在他们的回合中将隐藏作为一个动作。",
	"During the fight on his turn, Krall will boast:": "在Krall的回合进行战斗时，他会夸口说：",

	"This is a challenging fight, and if it looks like the party is having trouble add some wandering Perch Guard NPCs to aid them. A force of three birdfolk skirmishers should turn the tide in the party's favor, but the guards will be focused on defending the party and won't pursue Krall into the forest if he makes a run for it. Perch Guard forces should also come to chase off Krall if he's victorious, though he won't stick around for too long.": "这是一场具有挑战性的战斗，如果看起来队伍有困难，可以添加一些漫游的鲈鱼卫士NPC来帮助他们。三名鸟人游击队员的力量应该能扭转战局，但卫士们将专注于保护队伍，不会追击Krall进入森林，如果他试图逃跑。如果Krall获胜，鲈鱼卫士部队也会前来赶走他，尽管他不会逗留太久。",

	"Krall seeks revenge, but he isn't so foolhardy as to risk death here. If the party seems amenable, he'll beg for mercy and turn himself in. He has connections in Alderheart's criminal underbelly, and he would rather be imprisoned than dead.

Once he enters the forest, the party has only 2 rounds to capture him before he leads his pursuers into a prepared escape burrow where he will pull a lever which snaps a wooden portcullis over the entrance. The portcullis can be broken by spending an action and succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check, but in this time Krall will already have traveled down one of the many branching pathways of the tunnel and made a clean getaway. His followers don't know about the escape burrow, and they can be easily captured. Krall won't hesitate to cut them loose to save himself.": "克拉尔（Krall）寻求复仇，但他并不愚蠢到在这里冒死。如果冒险队伍看起来愿意，他会请求宽恕并自首。他在奥尔德哈特（Alderheart）的犯罪地下世界有关系，他宁愿被监禁也不愿意死。如果冒险队伍看起来不像是仁慈的人，克拉尔会在形势不利时命令他的部队四散逃入森林。一旦他进入森林，冒险队伍只有2回合的时间在他引领追兵进入一个准备好的逃生地洞之前将他抓住。当他拉动一个杠杆，使木制落闸门关闭入口时，可以通过花费一个动作并在DC 15的力量检定中成功来打破落闸门，但此时克拉尔已经沿着隧道的众多分支之一前进，成功逃脱。他的追随者不知道逃生地洞的存在，可以轻松被捕捉。克拉尔会毫不犹豫地放弃他们来拯救自己。",
	"If any Perch Guard came to offer assistance, those remaining will sound a horn, calling on reinforcements that will arrive in the next few minutes. This will include combat medics who can help tend to the party's wounds. The Perch Guard have orders to take a share of any treasure recovered from either Krall or his bandits back to Alderheart. However, the Guard appreciates the party's service to the Wood and will look the other way if the party decides to take the treasure for themselves.": "如果有任何栖卫卫士前来提供帮助，留下的人会吹响号角，请求即将在接下来几分钟内到达的增援。这将包括可以帮助治疗队伍伤口的战地医生。栖卫卫士们有命令将从Krall或他的匪徒那里找回的任何宝藏的一部分带回奥尔德哈特。然而，卫士们感激队伍对林地的服务，如果队伍决定将宝藏据为己有，他们会睁一只眼闭一只眼。",
	"The bandits all have standard equipment for their stat blocks, with the exception of Krall's parrying dagger, which appears to be of high quality and is branded with the insignia of the Bandit Coalition on its pommel.

	"The forest may be a quicker route to the Avium, but progress is slow in the dense undergrowth. This part of the forest is ancient, and its floor is a thick carpet of ferns, moss, and other plant life. Treat all areas in this forest that are not clearings or groves as difficult terrain, unless the party does something about it. Spells that deal fire or acid damage can remove the difficult terrain from target areas. Characters can also choose to climb up the branches and travel via gliding if they are birdfolk, completely bypassing the difficult terrain. The forest is thick enough that anyone up at least 30 feet in the giant trees will have an easy time finding branches in gliding range, allowing them to make progress at normal speed, or scout ahead with ease if they so desire.": "森林可能是通往阿维姆 (`Avium`) 的更快路径，但在茂密的灌木丛中前进很慢。这部分森林非常古老，地面上铺满了蕨类植物、苔藓和其他植物。除非队伍采取措施，否则请将这片森林中除了空地或树丛以外的所有区域视为艰难地形。施放火焰或酸性伤害的法术可以清除目标区域的艰难地形。角色也可以选择攀爬树枝，通过滑翔来旅行，如果他们是鸟人族群，完全可以绕过艰难地形。这片森林足够茂密，以至于在至少30英尺高的巨树上的任何人都可以轻松地找到在滑翔范围内的树枝，使他们可以以正常速度前进，或者如果他们愿意的话，轻松地前往侦察。",

	"The party will eventually encounter the {@creature forest prowler|HWCS} that has been nesting in the area for the last month. It makes its home in the treetops in well-camouflaged nests made from leaves and branches. A sure way to tell a prowler's nest from a giant bird's is the stench of meat. Prowlers keep carrion from the animals they hunt, usually giant elk or boars, on nearby branches as a source of food.": "队伍最终会遇到在该地区筑巢已有一个月的{@creature forest prowler|HWCS}。它在树梢上建造了伪装良好的巢，用树叶和树枝制成。要区分潜行者的巢和巨鸟的巢的一种方法是肉腥味。潜行者将它们猎杀的动物的腐肉，通常是巨麋或野猪，放在附近的树枝上作为食物来源。",
	"This encounter should happen towards the end of the party's journey through the forest. The characters could come across the prowler's lair mere hours from the forest's end, or the beast could ambush them as they camp for the night.

	"However the encounter happens, the prowler will study the party from a distance first, biding its time as they move through its territory. It will attempt to use its stealth to approach the party quietly, and will single out the smallest and most vulnerable character among the group as its prey. The prowler hunts through hit-and-run tactics, disappearing into the foliage with its camouflaging fur before pouncing again on unsuspecting foes. The prowler's incredible claws give it a solid grip on tree trunks, and it can climb even the highest branches with ease. Once it begins its assault it won't stop until it has scored a kill, or has been critically wounded.": "无论遭遇如何，潜行者将首先远距离观察队伍，耐心等待他们穿越其领地。它将尝试使用潜行技能悄悄接近队伍，并将选定最小和最脆弱的角色作为猎物。潜行者通过袭击和逃跑的战术进行狩猎，在毛皮的伪装下消失在树丛中，然后再次向毫无防备的敌人发动突袭。潜行者的惊人爪子让它能够牢固地抓住树干，甚至可以轻松地爬上最高的树枝。一旦开始攻击，它将不停下来，直到取得一次击杀，或者受到致命伤。",
	"After the party has either made their way through the forest or reached the end of the road, they will arrive at the Avium, the magical college of the birdfolk.

If it works, such a spell might drain the vital energies that make the aspect immortal, ending its threat to the Wood once and for all. The cobblefright is a threat to all who currently live and study in the Avium, and the party will need to uncover Odwald's secret laboratory and dangerous monster before he loses control of his creation.": "这些被撕下的页面包含了对抗火之本质所必需的信息，但玩家们直到他们发现奥德瓦尔德的秘密房间在图书馆里才能找到这些信息，奥德瓦尔德一直在利用他偷来的信息来计划如何杀死这个本质。奥德瓦尔德一直在涉足危险的死灵魔法，并且他创造了一个{@creature cobblefright|HWCS}来帮助他的研究，试图研究它的灵魂吸取能力，以便重新创造这种效果作为一个大规模的法术。如果成功，这样一个法术可能会耗尽让本质永生的重要能量，从而永久终结对伍德的威胁。这个石砾恐怖是对目前居住和学习在阿维姆的所有人的威胁，团队需要找出奥德瓦尔德的秘密实验室和危险的怪物，以免他失去对自己创造物的控制。",
	"There are many pathways players can follow throughout this investigation, and many ways for the party to come across important information. The party doesn't need to know everything to find out the location of Odwald's lair, but the more they know, the more complete their picture of the happenings at the Avium will be. Because there are many connections players can make between different leads, clues, and avenues of investigation, some sections will cross-reference others that might be relevant.": "在这次调查中，玩家可以选择许多不同的路径，而派对也可以通过多种方式获得重要信息。派对并不需要了解所有内容才能找到奥德瓦尔德的巢穴位置，但他们了解的越多，对阿维姆事件的全貌就会越清晰。由于玩家可以在不同线索、线索和调查途径之间建立许多联系，因此一些部分会交叉参考其他可能相关的部分。",
	"If the players are lost or unsure where to go, an NPC can deliver one or more of the following hints to move the narrative along:": "如果玩家迷失或不确定去哪里，NPC可以提供以下一条或多条线索来推动叙事：",
	"Only faculty members have access to tomes dealing with high-level or forbidden magic, and even then it's solely intended for research purposes. Removing one of these dangerous books from the lower library, or practicing the knowledge they contain, is grounds for termination from the Avium.": "只有教职人员才能接触到处理高级或禁忌魔法的典籍，即使如此，也仅限于研究目的。从下层图书馆中拿走这些危险的书籍之一，或者实践它们所包含的知识，都是被开除出 (Avium) 的理由。",
	"One tenured librarian, Mordane Swiftgale, has always been an odd one, but lately he's been keeping to himself even more than usual.": "一位终身职图书管理员，莫丹·斯威夫盖尔(Mordane Swiftgale)，一直是个古怪的人，但最近他比往常更加沉默寡言。",
	"Secret rooms were built into the Avium, and many remain undiscovered to this day.": "阿维姆(Avium)中建造了秘密房间，至今仍有许多尚未被发现。",
	"A lot of odd things seem to be happening in and around the lower library. Books with missing pages, malfunctioning servitor skeletons, and strange noises coming from the stacks, have all been reported.": "在(`lower library`)内外似乎发生了许多奇怪的事情。有人报告说书籍缺页、(`servitor skeletons`)出现故障，以及从书架中传来奇怪的声音。",
	"Players can find the information they need through reading tomes in the library or speaking with knowledgeable NPCs on campus. By the end of their time at the Avium players should know the following:": "玩家可以通过阅读图书馆中的书籍或与校园内知识渊博的NPC交谈来获取他们所需的信息。在他们在阿维姆(Avium)的时间结束时，玩家应该知道以下内容：",
	"The aspect of fire is immortal. There is no known way to destroy it without it simply regenerating.": "火焰的本质是不朽的。没有已知的方法可以摧毁它，除非它只是重新生成。",
	"The aspect of fire consumes living forests for energy.": "火焰之力量消耗着活生生的森林以获取能量。",
	"The aspect of fire is weakened by cold damage, which may cause it to cool and become immobilized.": "寒冷伤害会削弱火焰的力量，可能导致其冷却并变得无法移动。",
	"In the past, the aspect of fire was sealed away using a conjuration circle somewhere in the Grove.": "过去，火元素之力被封印在（Grove）某处的召唤阵中。",
	"The Avium is a remarkable structure, and as the party approaches it, either from the forest or from the road, read the following:": "当派对从森林或道路接近(Avium)时，这座建筑非常引人注目，读以下内容：",
	"Four gigantic circular stone platforms float alongside several towers and spires in the air above you. These structures slowly rotate around a leafless and branchless tree trunk made from solid stone. The trunk towers hundreds of feet high, and the orbiting structures appear to connect to stone bridges which jut out of the trunk near its upper levels. You see two Perch Guards in crenellated watch posts above the entryway to this petrified trunk. They greet you, and moments later a robed, bespectacled raptor glides down to land at your feet.": "四个巨大的圆形石台与几座塔楼和尖塔一起漂浮在你头顶的空中。这些结构缓慢地围绕着一个由坚实石头制成的无叶无枝的树干旋转。这根树干高达数百英尺，而环绕的结构似乎连接到石桥上，这些石桥从树干的上部突出。你看到两名(Perch Guards)站在这根石化树干入口上方的垛口上。他们向你打招呼，片刻后，一只穿着长袍、戴着眼镜的猛禽滑翔而下，降落在你脚下。",
	"The raptor is an associate professor named {@creature Rhys Birchwalker|HWCS}, who has been sent to greet the party. She explains the Dean is expecting them, and then leads the party to the large central gate, which appears to be the only entrance into the structure. She withdraws a an amulet with the Avium's crest upon it from the folds of her robe and presents it to the giant wooden double doors. After a brief moment the same symbol etches itself in light across the entrance. Then, with a heavy creak, the doors begin to part, revealing an interior lounge.": "这只猛禽是一位名叫{@creature Rhys Birchwalker|HWCS}的副教授，她被派去迎接这支队伍。她解释说院长正在等他们，然后带领他们走向中央大门，这似乎是进入这座建筑的唯一入口。她从长袍的褶皱中取出一枚镶有阿维姆徽章的护身符，递给巨大的木质双门。经过短暂的片刻，同样的符号在入口处以光的形式刻画出来。然后，门发出沉重的吱嘎声，开始敞开，露出一个内部休息室。",
	"A main desk sits near the far wall, behind which a scribe is busy with tottering piles of paper. Several chairs and couches are situated around circular tables throughout the room, which is lit comfortably by floating braisers containing magical flames. Portraits of wizened birdfolk hang from the walls, each one wearing robes similar to those of your attendant.": "一个主办桌子坐在靠近远墙的位置，桌子后面一个抄写员正忙碌地处理着摇摇欲坠的一堆纸张。房间里放置着几把椅子和沙发，分布在整个房间的圆桌周围，房间内透过悬浮的火盆舒适地照亮，火盆里燃烧着魔法火焰。墙上挂着一些老练的鸟人肖像，每一幅肖像都穿着与你的服务人员相似的长袍。",
	"Behind the main desk is a spiral staircase that leads down. The staircase is flanked by a pair of large birdfolk statues, one of which bears the likeness of a corvum whose portrait hangs from the west wall. Opposite this staircase, a circular platform rests in its own cylindrical alcove.": "主柜台后面是一座螺旋楼梯，通往下方。楼梯两侧是一对巨大的鸟人雕像，其中一个雕像是一只(`corvum`)，其肖像挂在西墙上。在这座楼梯的对面，一个圆形平台位于自己的圆柱形壁龛内。",
	"Professor Birchwalker leads the party onto the circular platform and utters an incantation, which causes the entire stone disk to rise from the ground and propel the group upwards through the tree trunk. A few windows occasionally zip by on the way up, showing glimpses of the Wood and just how high the party is traveling. The platform stops halfway up the structure, and the party finds themselves in an area next to a busy atrium. Following Professor Birchwalker, everyone arrives at the Dean's office.": "伯奇沃克教授带领着队伍走上圆形平台，念咒语，导致整个石盘从地面上升起，将团队通过树干向上推进。在上升的过程中，偶尔会经过一些窗户，展示着木屋和团队旅行的高度。平台在结构的一半停下，团队发现自己身处一个繁忙中庭旁的区域。跟随着伯奇沃克教授，每个人都来到了院长办公室。",
	"You and your companions enter into a round stone office. It is surrounded on all sides by windows, through which several spires and large circular terrariums can be observed slowly floating by. The many tables inside the office are filled with disorganized piles of books, and the desk is in a similar state of disorder. A sable luma peeks up from over the books. \"Oh, please excuse me! I'm reviewing a few... hundred theses for my students. Excellent work! But, one does tend to lose track of time. I'm terribly sorry.\"": "你和你的同伴进入一个圆石办公室。四周被窗户环绕，透过窗户可以看到几座尖塔和大型圆形玻璃温室缓缓飘过。办公室内的许多桌子上堆满了杂乱的书籍，桌子也处于类似的混乱状态。一只黑色的流星灵从书堆上探出头来。“哦，请原谅我！我正在为我的学生审阅几百篇论文。做得很好！但是，人往往会忘记时间。非常抱歉。”",
	"The luma is {@creature Gabe Windsworth|HWCS}, the Dean of the Avium. He will apologize profusely and clear a few tomes off his desk before moving to give each party member a firm handshake and an official welcome to his College. The Dean will then cut right to the chase: he knows why the party is here and what they've come for, thanks to messages from the Council. He is eager to help them find whatever they need to stop the aspect of fire. The Dean will tell the party:": "卢玛是{@creature Gabe Windsworth|HWCS}，阿维姆学院的院长。他会深表歉意，清理掉桌上的一些书籍，然后给每位队员一个坚定的握手，正式欢迎他们加入他的学院。院长会直截了当地说出他知道队伍为何而来，以及他们所寻找的东西，这都得益于议会的消息。他急切地希望能帮助他们找到一切他们需要的，以阻止火焰之影。院长会告诉队伍：",
	"\"You won't find information on something that old and powerful in just any library. Thankfully, the Avium was built upon the greatest store of knowledge in all of Humblewood... literally! Beneath the main building is the oldest structure here, a library with a collection of tomes, folios, and manuscripts gathered from all over Everden. With any luck, that's where you'll find what you're looking for. Now, a disclaimer—some of the tomes in there are a little... uh, deadly. But worry not, our librarians are experts. They'll help point you in the right direction while steering you clear of the more... 'advanced' materials.\"": "\"在任何图书馆中都找不到关于那个古老而强大的事物的信息。幸运的是，阿维姆(Avium)建在整个谦卑森林中最大的知识库之上...真的！在主楼下面是这里最古老的建筑，一个图书馆，收集了来自埃弗登(Everden)各地的书籍、册页和手稿。希望你能在那里找到你要找的东西。现在，免责声明——那里的一些书籍有点...呃，致命。但不用担心，我们的图书管理员都是专家。他们会帮助你找到正确的方向，同时避开更... '高级' 的材料。\"",
	"He will then give each of the characters a small amulet with the insignia of the Avium. These appear to be of lesser quality than Professor Birchwalker's, and Dean Windsworth will inform the party that these are amulets, made especially for guest researchers. The party will then be free to roam the grounds.": "接着，他会给每个角色一个带有艾维姆徽章的小护身符。这些看起来质量比伯奇沃克教授的要差一些，温兹沃斯院长会告诉队伍，这些护身符是专门为客座研究员制作的。然后队伍就可以自由地在园区里游荡了。",
	"The Dean knows the importance of their mission, but he also knows they've had a long journey. The amulets will give the party access to dormitory chambers that have been prepared specifically for them. The room will have exactly the right number of bunkbeds for the playgroup. The party won't need to worry about food either, as their guest amulets grant them free meals at the campus dining hall. Characters are also free to sit in on any lectures they wish to attend around campus, as well as to peruse the more conventional libraries housed in the orbiting structures.": "院长知道他们的使命的重要性，但他也知道他们已经走了很长一段路。护身符将使队伍能够进入为他们专门准备的宿舍房间。房间里将会有恰好适合游戏小组的双层床。队伍也不需要担心食物问题，因为他们的客人护身符可以让他们在校园餐厅享用免费餐点。角色们也可以自由选择参加校园内任何想要出席的讲座，同时也可以查阅围绕在轨道结构中的更传统的图书馆。",
	"Refer to Fig. 4.1 for a map of the Avium.": "请参考图4.1，查看（Avium）的地图。",
	"At the heart of the Avium is the central building, made from the trunk of a petrified tree. It is orbited by four terrariums and a dozen or so smaller towers. Each structure which orbits the trunk does so at varying heights and speeds, between one rotation every 10 minutes, and one rotation every half hour.": "在阿维姆(Avium)的中心是一座由石化树干制成的中央建筑。它被四个玻璃园和十几座较小的塔楼环绕。每个围绕树干运转的建筑物高度和速度各不相同，介于每10分钟一次旋转和每半小时一次旋转之间。",
	"The orbiting structures each have gliding platforms and moveable bridges, which correspond with bridge sections on other structures and connect at regular intervals to form complete overpasses. These structures stay aligned for 10 minutes, allowing for crossing by foot. For humblefolk students, knowing when to cross can make the difference between missing a class and arriving on time. But for birdfolk, the entire aerial campus can be traversed with ease. If ever in doubt about how long it will take for the route to an orbiting structure to connect, roll {@dice 3d10} and use that number in minutes to decide when the next favorable rotation will be.": "每个轨道结构都有滑行平台和可移动的桥梁，这些桥梁与其他结构上的桥梁部分相对应，并定期连接，形成完整的天桥。这些结构保持对齐状态10分钟，允许步行穿越。对于平凡的学生来说，知道何时穿越可能是迟到或准时到达课堂之间的区别。但对于飞禽族来说，整个空中校园可以轻松穿越。如果对到达轨道结构的路线需要多长时间感到犹豫，掷骰{@dice 3d10}，并使用该数字以分钟为单位决定下一次有利旋转的时间。",
	"There are many places in the Avium for characters to explore, and characters can spend their time here however they wish. Those who so desire can learn new spells or concoct potions. To track the party's activities, let the players know that each day they spend in the Avium consists of eight hours within which they can benefit from all the College has to offer. After this time, several campus areas close their doors to students, and only those with special faculty amulets can get past security. Studying at the College can grant one of the following benefits:": "在（阿维姆）中有许多地方供角色探索，角色可以自由度过他们的时间。那些希望如此的人可以学习新法术或调制药剂。为了追踪队伍的活动，请让玩家知道，他们在（阿维姆）度过的每一天包括八个小时，他们可以从学院所提供的一切中受益。在此之后，几个校园区域关闭他们的大门，只有那些有特殊教职员护身符的人才能通过安全检查。在学院学习可以获得以下其中一项好处：",
	"Wizards who study here can add any spell on the wizard's spell list to their spellbook, but they still require the necessary amount of coin and time to do this. Spells are only granted to wizards deemed worthy of their power, meaning only spells of a level the wizard could cast will be made available.": "在这里学习的巫师可以将巫师法术列表中的任何法术添加到他们的法术书中，但他们仍然需要足够的金币和时间来做到这一点。只有被认为配得上这种力量的巫师才会获得法术，这意味着只有巫师能够施展的级别的法术才会被提供。",
	"By spending a full day studying and practicing, any bard, ranger, sorcerer or warlock can swap one spell they have learned previously for another of the same level that is on their class spell list.": "经过一整天的学习和实践，任何吟游诗人，游侠，术士或术士可以将他们之前学过的一个法术替换为同级别的另一个存在于他们职业法术列表中的法术。",
	"Additionally, any character proficient with a {@item herbalism kit|phb} can avail themselves of the campus potions laboratory, which stocks reagents needed for potion making. Creating a potion can be done for the normal cost (to help cover the expenses associated with growing so many magical herbs) and only takes one day of brewing instead of the normal amount of time it would take to craft such an item.": "另外，任何精通{@item herbalism kit|phb}(Potions)的角色都可以利用校园药剂实验室，那里备有制作药剂所需的试剂。制作药剂的成本与正常相同（以帮助支付种植如此多的魔法草药所需的费用），只需要一天的时间酿造，而不是通常需要制作此类物品所需的时间。",
	"Faculty offices, most lecture halls, the large communal dining hall, and the infirmary are all located in the central building. A Perch Guard station near the middle of the central building serves as the headquarters for campus security forces. Servitor skeletons can often be found here, performing janitorial tasks.": "中央建筑物内设有教职员办公室、大多数讲堂、大型共用餐厅和医务室。中央建筑物中部附近设有一座(Perch Guard)哨站，作为校园安保部队的总部。在这里经常可以看到执行清洁任务的仆役骷髅。",
	"The four terrariums are circular stone structures with bowl-shaped bottoms and mostly flat surfaces. They are contained in magical spherical fields, which allow matter to pass through, but are designed to shield and contain magical blasts. This keeps the surrounding structures safe in case of an accident. Three of the terrariums are 200 feet in diameter. They contain different biomes and are used for natural research. The fourth is smaller, only 100 feet across, and is located higher up. It houses a security building, as well as a gaol, both overseen by the Perch Guard.": "这四个玻璃箱是圆形石结构，底部呈碗状，表面大多平坦。它们被包裹在魔法球形场域中，允许物质通过，但设计用于抵挡和包容魔法攻击。这样一来，周围的建筑在发生意外时能够保持安全。其中三个玻璃箱直径为200英尺。它们包含不同的生态系统，用于自然研究。第四个较小，直径仅为100英尺，位于较高位置。它设有一个安全建筑，以及一个监狱，由(Perch Guard)监督管理。",
	"The floating towers are between 40 to 80 feet across, and they are the oldest structures orbiting the central tree. Some house libraries and small classrooms on niche subjects, mostly for advanced students of a particular school of magic. Other towers contain laboratories for practicing spellcraft, testing established arcane theorems, and brewing potions.": "这些漂浮的塔楼直径在40到80英尺之间，它们是环绕中央树最古老的建筑物。一些塔楼内设有图书馆和狭小的教室，专门为某一魔法学派的高级学生而设。其他塔楼则包含用于实践咒术、测试已确立的奥术理论和酿造药剂的实验室。",
	"Located high in the Avium's structure, this large office belongs to Dean Windsworth. More than just his private study, it is a historical part of the building, having been used by every headmaster of the Avium since the College's founding. Dean Windsworth can often be found here poring over documents.": "位于阿维姆(Avium)结构的高处，这间宽敞的办公室属于温兹沃斯院长(Dean Windsworth)。这不仅仅是他的私人书房，也是建筑的历史组成部分，自学院成立以来，每位阿维姆的校长都曾使用过这间办公室。温兹沃斯院长经常可以在这里埋头研究文件。",
	"The central building houses dormitories for students and faculty. The student rooms are near the lower part of the tree, and are divided by an individual's standing within the Avium, with those in their first year having rooms closer to the ground. The faculty dorms rest above these, in areas off limits to students.": "中央建筑物内设有学生和教职员工的宿舍。学生的房间靠近树的下部，并根据个人在阿维姆中的地位进行划分，一年级学生的房间更靠近地面。教职员工的宿舍位于这些房间的上方，学生无权进入这些区域。",
	"The lower library consists of a series of rooms and corridors, shaped from inside the tree's stone roots. Unlike many of the classrooms in the central building, which have been remodeled, much of the lower library remains unchanged since the days of the Avium's founding. It contains the most dangerous and rare books in the Avium, and only high ranking faculty members and a few special guest researchers are privy to the contents within. The sturdy stone shelves here are molded from the same stone that makes up the floor. They tower with books and require little in the way of care beyond dusting (though some sections are clearly overdue for it).": "下层图书馆由一系列房间和走廊组成，形状由树木石根内部塑造而成。与中央建筑中许多经过翻新的教室不同，下层图书馆的大部分区域自从阿维姆(Avium)建立以来就保持不变。它收藏了阿维姆中最危险和稀有的书籍，只有高级教职工和少数特别来宾研究人员才能查阅其中的内容。这里坚固的石头书架是用构成地板的相同石头塑造而成。书架上堆满了书籍，除了需要打扫灰尘之外几乎不需要其他照料（尽管有些区域显然已经过期需要清理）。",
	"The staircase near the entrance leads down to the lower library. This area is only accessible to those with the appropriate pass, at appropriate times of day. If the party attempts to descend the stairs without their guest amulets or outside of normal hours, the two {@creature stone golem|mm|stone golems} that guard the entrance (the birdfolk statues on either side of the stairway) will come to life and attempt to stop them. The golems seek only to restrain the party until Perch Guard authorities arrive. If the party attempts combat, the golems will defend themselves, but they will strike with calculated force. Any character reduced to 0 hit points by the golems will remain stable, since the sentries are under strict commands to incapacitate intruders, not kill them.": "入口附近的楼梯通往下层图书馆。这个区域只对持有适当通行证且在适当时间的人开放。如果冒险小组在没有客人护身符或在非正常时间试图下楼梯，那么守卫入口的两个{@creature stone golem|mm|stone golems}（楼梯两侧的鸟人雕像）将会活过来并试图阻止他们。这些魔像只是想要制止冒险小组直到警卫到达。如果冒险小组试图发动战斗，魔像会进行自卫，但他们会使用计算过的力量。任何被魔像打至0点生命值的角色会保持稳定，因为这些哨兵受到严格命令只能使闯入者无力，而不是杀死他们。",
	"As characters enter the lower library they will be greeted by the librarian, Mordane Swiftgale, who is actually Odwald Ebonhart in disguise. This is a magical effect produced by a specially crafted pendant that Odwald wears, and as long as he (or anyone else) wears it, they will look and sound exactly like Mordane Swiftgale. This is a transmutation effect, although it has been supplemented with illusion spells so as not to appear magical when examined with {@spell detect magic} or similar effects.": "当角色进入下层图书馆时，他们会受到图书管理员莫丹·斯威夫盖尔(Mordane Swiftgale)的欢迎，实际上他是奥德瓦尔德·埃邦哈特(Odwald Ebonhart)的伪装。这是由奥德瓦尔德佩戴的一枚特制吊坠产生的魔法效果，只要他（或其他人）佩戴它，他们看起来和听起来会和莫丹·斯威夫盖尔完全一样。这是一种变形效果，尽管它已经被幻术法术补充，以便在用{@spell detect magic}或类似效果检查时不显得是魔法。",
	"As you reach the bottom of the long and winding staircase, you emerge into a room filled with rows upon rows of large stone shelves, each containing several hundred books. Magical braisers illuminate this area, but their light strains to reach every nook between the large bookshelves. A swift strig sits reading behind a desk in the center of the room. As you approach he puts down his book and eyes you curiously. \"The Defenders of Alderheart, I presume?\"": "当你走到长长的蜿蜒楼梯的底部时，你来到一个房间，里面摆满了一排排大石架，每个架子上都摆放着数百本书。魔法火盆照亮了这个区域，但它们的光线难以到达大书架之间的每一个角落。一个迅捷的(`Alderheart`)斯特里格坐在房间中央的桌子后阅读着。当你走近时，他放下书，好奇地打量着你。“艾尔德哈特的守护者，我猜对了吗？”",
	"Odwald will inform the party that he is Mordane Swiftgale, and he's been instructed to help them find whatever they need. While the request came directly from the Dean, Odwald has some trepidation about assisting the party. He fears that if the heroes start poking around, they'll discover the pages he tore from the tomes. If characters notice his nervousness and make a Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check, have Odwald make an opposed Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check. Even if a character succeeds they won't find out anything incriminating, only that Mordane appears apprehensive. If characters report the missing pages to him, Odwald will feign shock and confusion and recommend they notify the Dean as such vandalism is taken very seriously. If a character doesn't believe Odwald, have the character make another Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check opposed by Odwald's Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check.": "Odwald会告诉队伍他是莫丹·斯威夫盖尔(Mordane Swiftgale)，并且他已经被指示帮助他们找到他们需要的东西。虽然请求直接来自院长，但Odwald对协助队伍感到有些忐忑不安。他担心如果英雄们开始四处打听，他们会发现他从书籍中撕下的页面。如果角色们注意到他的紧张并进行一次感知({@skill Insight})检定，让Odwald进行一次对抗魅力({@skill Deception})检定。即使角色成功了，他们也不会发现任何可疑之处，只会发现莫丹看起来有些紧张。如果角色向他报告缺失的页面，Odwald会假装震惊和困惑，并建议他们通知院长，因为这种破坏行为是非常严肃的。如果有角色不相信Odwald，让该角色再进行一次感知({@skill Insight})检定，对抗Odwald的魅力({@skill Deception})检定。",
	"A success will show the character that Mordane is clearly flustered, but nothing more. Odwald's bluster is in character with Mordane, who was always passionate about the library, and this will help to conceal his true identity.": "成功的话会展示莫丹(Mordane)明显慌乱的性格，但不会有更多。奥德瓦尔德(Odwald)的夸夸其谈与莫丹的性格相符，他一直对图书馆充满激情，这将有助于掩盖他的真实身份。",
	"For players who want to use their downtime to research the aspect, they need to decide what types of information to look for. The information the characters will be looking for can broadly fit into four categories: {@b The Scorched Grove}, {@b The Great Calamity}, {@b Elemental Creatures}, and {@b Conjuration Magic}. Each category has an associated amount of time required for research in order to obtain all the information for that category. This time can be lessened by having multiple characters research different areas of the same topic.": "对于想利用闲暇时间研究（the aspect）的玩家，他们需要决定要寻找哪些类型的信息。角色将寻找的信息可以大致分为四类：{@b The Scorched Grove}，{@b The Great Calamity}，{@b Elemental Creatures}，和{@b Conjuration Magic}。每个类别都有一个相关的研究所需时间，以获取该类别的所有信息。通过让多个角色研究同一主题的不同领域，可以缩短这段时间。",
	"If the party ends up stuck during research, or are unsure of what to do, you can always have them run into one of the NPCs in this chapter: Professor Birchwalker, Professor Revayne, or even Dean Windsworth. Any of these characters would be able to guide the party in their research and help point them towards the sections they should investigate.": "如果队伍在研究过程中陷入困境，或者不确定该怎么做，你可以让他们遇到本章中的其中一个NPC：樺木教授 (Professor Birchwalker)，雷文教授 (Professor Revayne)，甚至温兹沃斯院长 (Dean Windsworth)。这些角色中的任何一个都能指导队伍的研究，并帮助他们找到应该调查的部分。",
	"Alternatively, if your party finds the research portion boring, you can skip to the incident in {@adventure Shadows Fall|HWAitW|4|Shadows Fall} early. This will provide some action and a quick transition from the party's investigation into the strange occurrences happening at the Avium. ": "另外，如果你的队伍觉得研究部分很无聊，你可以直接跳到{@adventure Shadows Fall|HWAitW|4|Shadows Fall}发生的事件。这将为队伍提供一些动作，并快速过渡到队伍对阿维姆发生的奇怪事件进行调查。",
	"While Odwald wants to stop the party's efforts, he knows just how much attention he could draw to himself if he acts out of character. He'll guide them to the first three topics, but anyone looking for help acquiring information on Conjuration Magic will find Mordane busying himself with other tasks, such as cataloging source materials and returning tomes to far-flung wings of the enormous underground library.": "尽管奥德瓦尔德(Odwald)想要阻止派对的努力，但他知道如果表现出格会引起多少关注。他会引导他们到前三个话题，但任何想要获取有关幻术魔法信息的人会发现莫丹(Mordane)正忙于其他任务，比如整理来源材料并将书籍归还到庞大地下图书馆的遥远区域。",
	"If what a player wants to research doesn't fit into one of these categories, either base the findings on what's known about the aspect (be careful not to give too much away), or rule that while they located the tome they were looking for, all important information appears to have been on pages that were ripped out. No matter how much time the characters spend on research, the information on torn-out pages can't be found in other books.": "如果玩家想要研究的内容不属于这些类别之一，要么基于已知的相关方面得出研究结果（小心不要透露太多信息），要么规定他们虽然找到了他们寻找的典籍，但所有重要信息似乎都在被撕掉的页面上。无论角色花费多少时间进行研究，被撕掉的页面上的信息都无法在其他书籍中找到。",
	"There are many books here regarding the Scorched Grove, and since scholarly interest in this subject is so focused on its physical properties, origins, and fauna, it won't take more than a day of research before a character finds information repeating itself or covering the same questions from increasingly esoteric angles.": "这里有许多关于焦痕林的书籍，由于学者们对这个主题的兴趣主要集中在它的物理特性、起源和动植物上，因此在研究一天后，角色很快就会发现信息开始重复，或者从越来越神秘的角度探讨相同的问题。",
	"Most of the writing available on the Grove covers what was already provided in {@adventure Part 3: An Urgent Summons|HWAitW|3}. Reiterate information for the players if necessary, or just say that no new information is available. However, one book found by a character researching this topic will contain important knowledge. The character finds the following passage:": "Grove上的大部分文献都涵盖了已经在{@adventure Part 3: An Urgent Summons|HWAitW|3}中提供的内容。如果需要，为玩家重申信息，或者只是说没有新信息可用。然而，一个角色在研究这个主题时发现了一本书，其中包含重要的知识。角色发现以下段落：",
	"... from the above evidence, one can conclude that the Scorched Grove displays properties which suggest extreme conjury, perhaps even the calling of a major elemental force. Whether this was conjured from a nearby plane or a farther one remains uncertain, but the readiness with which the elemental magics have taken root suggests a source in close proximity to our world.": "...根据上述证据，可以得出结论：焦土林地展现出的特性暗示着极端的魔法召唤，甚至可能是召唤了一股重要的元素力量。这股力量是来自附近位面还是更远的位面，尚不确定，但元素魔法扎根的迅速程度表明这股力量源自我们世界附近的某处。",
	"There is very little work of substance on the Great Calamity, as numerous books addressing the subject resort to legend more than truth. Those books which do attempt serious historical study of the event note the relative lack of credible living witnesses. In terms of overall scope, there is a wealth of material written about the Calamity, although the information is unfocused and spread across many books. It could take a character three days of research to get through all there is to read. Quite a few books have had pages torn out and these seem to reference prophecies of some kind, but it's unclear exactly what they pertain to.": "关于（Great Calamity）这个事件，实质性的研究资料非常少，许多涉及这个主题的书籍更多地倾向于传说而非真相。那些试图对这一事件进行严肃历史研究的书籍指出，可信的活着的目击者相对较少。就整体范围而言，关于（Calamity）的资料非常丰富，尽管信息零散且分布在许多书籍中。一个角色可能需要三天的时间来研究所有的内容。相当多的书籍有页面被撕裂的情况，这些页面似乎提到了某种预言，但究竟指的是什么尚不清楚。",
	"The following passage was found:": "发现了以下文字：",
	"... regardless of the origin of the Calamity, whether or not the rumors of an elder elemental being hold any truth to them, a magical event of incredible significance is almost certain to have taken place. The calling of such elemental energies, whether through evocation or conjuration, would require a mage of unparalleled skill, or an entity of unfathomable power.": "...无论灾难的起源如何，无论关于一位上古元素生物的传闻是否属实，几乎可以肯定发生了一场具有不可思议意义的魔法事件。召唤这种元素能量，无论是通过唤灵还是召唤术，都需要一位无与伦比的法师，或者一个深不可测的实体。",
	"Details on the aspect have been torn out of one book: an eyewitness account, from someone who claimed to have seen a \"creature of fire and destruction.\"": "有一本书中关于这个方面的细节被撕掉了：一位目击者的描述，他声称看到了一只“火焰和毁灭之物”(`Aspect`)。",

	"A fairly straightforward avenue of research, the library holds a wealth of tomes on elemental creatures. However, elementals of the size seen in the Grove comprise a narrow field of study, and a character researching this subject should be able to find everything they need to know in about two days of study. The following information can be found:": "作为一个相当直接的研究途径，图书馆收藏了大量关于元素生物的书籍。然而，在格罗夫中出现的这种规模的元素生物构成了一个狭窄的研究领域，研究这个主题的角色应该能在大约两天的学习中找到他们需要了解的一切。以下信息可以找到：",
	"The most important thing they will learn is that elementals of this size are normally elder elementals, incredibly powerful beings that re-shape the lands in which they live through their sheer presence. These beings would require advanced conjuration magics to summon.": "他们将学到的最重要的一点是，这种规模的元素生物通常是(elder elementals)，这些是非常强大的存在，通过他们强大的存在改变着他们居住的土地。要召唤这些存在需要高级的幻术魔法。",
	"Many elder elementals have the traits of one or two elements working in concert. Stories from across Humblewood tell of a fire and earth elemental who may have been involved in the calamity that birthed the Scorched Grove.": "许多年长的元素生物具有一个或两个元素共同发挥作用的特征。来自Humblewood各地的故事讲述了一个火元素和土元素可能参与了导致Scorched Grove诞生的灾难。",

This is only temporary, however, and depending on the power of the creature, this immobilized state may only last for one hour.": "...当冷却它们的熔融外表时，会减缓这些生物的速度，最终将它们包裹在坚硬土壤的外壳中，使它们无法移动。然而，这种状态只是暂时的，取决于生物的力量，这种瘫痪状态可能只持续一个小时。",
	"A fragment of text in one book reads:": "一本书中的一个片段如下：",
	"Elder elementals have strong connections to the energy of their aspected element. This connection can be so strong that...": "年长元素生物与其属性元素的能量有着强烈的联系。这种联系可能会非常强烈，以至于...",
	"...some of the most powerful elementals have been reported to regenerate themselves completely if destroyed through conventional means. They do this through the vast reservoirs of aspected energy present in areas that have been infused with their elemental aura, normally through extended exposure to the elder elemental.": "...一些最强大的元素生物据说如果通过常规手段被摧毁，它们可以完全再生。它们通过被注入其元素气息的区域中存在的大量相应能量来实现这一点，通常是通过长时间暴露于上古元素(`elder elemental`)的影响下。",
	"Finally, the party may come across a few burned pages from an old tome. The pages are badly damaged, almost as if they were saved from a fire, and are kept in a small magical field to prevent further disintegration. Their origin is unknown. The following passage can be made out:": "最后，冒险者们可能会发现一些来自一本古老书籍的烧焦页面。这些页面严重受损，几乎像是从火灾中被救出来的，并被保存在一个小的魔法领域中，以防止进一步分解。它们的来源是未知的。以下段落可以辨认出来：",
	"\"After its defeat, the aspect of ice lost a single shard... {@i the Borealus}... was sealed away...

	"Any player who picked up on the evidence of conjuration magic in the Grove, possibly from their encounter with the {@adventure Cloud of Emberbats|HWAitW|3|Cloud of Emberbats}, could have their character investigate this topic. Other research topics could lead characters here as well. This is a broad category, and even when pared down to tomes on elemental summoning, it would take time to sift through. After four days of research, a character will learn the following:": "任何玩家如果在林地中察觉到召唤魔法的证据，可能是从与{@adventure Cloud of Emberbats|HWAitW|3|Cloud of Emberbats}的遭遇中得知的，都可以让他们的角色调查这个话题。其他研究课题也可能会引导角色来到这里。这是一个广泛的类别，即使缩小到元素召唤的文献，也需要时间来筛选。经过四天的研究，一个角色将会学到以下内容：",
	"A large conjuration circle would be needed in order to seal away anything as massive as the aspect of fire. The circle may have become obscured over time, but it is impossible for the aspect to have been kept dormant all this time without it.": "为了封印像火之本质这样庞大的存在，需要一个巨大的降妖阵。随着时间的推移，这个阵法可能已经变得模糊不清，但是没有这个阵法，火之本质不可能一直被保持沉睡状态。",
	"After finding the previous piece of information, further research will lead the party to a cryptic tome: a treatise by a conjurer who attempted to calculate the location of the postulated conjuration circle within the Grove. The conjurer's treatise is based on painstaking research on energy readings, topography, ley lines, and other academic esoterica. However, while the complex formulae of his calculations remain, the pages that actually specify the location have been ripped out (see {@adventure The Old Classroom|HWAitW|4|The Old Classroom}).": "在找到前一段信息后，进一步的研究将引导冒险小组找到一本神秘的书：一本由一位术士撰写的论文，试图计算位于林地中的传说召唤圈的位置。这位术士的论文基于对能量读数、地形、地脉线和其他学术奥秘的艰苦研究。然而，尽管他的复杂计算公式仍然存在，但实际指定位置的页面已经被撕掉（见{@adventure The Old Classroom|HWAitW|4|The Old Classroom}）。",
	"Without the missing page, the conjurer's calculations could be worked through to find the location of the circle, but it would be incredibly challenging, taking at least a full day of research by someone proficient in the {@skill Arcana} skill. At the end of the day, the researcher must make a DC 21 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. On a success, the character calculates the circle's postulated location in the Grove, which is on its eastern edge, at a point between Winnowing Reach and Alderheart. On a failure, the character must repeat the process, requiring another full day of calculations. Other characters can help with this roll, granting advantage to the character rolling for the check, but only if the supporting characters are also proficient in the {@skill Arcana} skill. Professor Birchwalker can also help a character perform the calculations to find the location of the conjuration circle within the Grove.": "没有缺失的页面，术士的计算可以通过来找到圆圈的位置，但这将是极具挑战性的，至少需要一个精通{@skill Arcana}技能的人进行整整一天的研究。在一天结束时，研究者必须进行一次 DC 21 智力检定({@skill Arcana})。成功的话，角色会计算出圆圈在格罗夫中推测的位置，位于其东边，在Winnowing Reach和Alderheart之间的某个点。失败的话，角色必须重复这个过程，需要再次进行整整一天的计算。其他角色可以帮助进行这次检定，为进行检定的角色提供优势，但前提是支持角色也精通{@skill Arcana}技能。Birchwalker教授也可以帮助角色进行计算，找到格罗夫内降妖法阵的位置。",
	"After the party completes five days of research, Odwald will become nervous. He'll try to use a necromantic ritual ripped from one of the tomes he stole in an attempt to scare the party off. He'll wait until the party members are absorbed in their tasks before acting. When no one is watching him, he will use {@spell greater invisibility} to move unseen and unheard between the large stacks, then cast the ritual slowly and quietly. Once Odwald completes the ritual, he'll discard the useless ritual page in a place where the characters can find it, attempting to frame another necromancer on campus. If characters search the area where the shadows appeared, they will find the page. A DC 16 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check will reveal the dark runes scratched upon the parchment to be associated with particularly foul necromancy. All the magic in the runes has been spent.": "在派对完成了五天的研究后，奥德瓦尔德会变得紧张。他会尝试使用从他偷来的书籍中摘取的一种死灵魔法仪式，试图吓跑派对成员。他会等到派对成员专心于他们的任务时才采取行动。当没有人看着他时，他会使用{@spell greater invisibility}在大堆书籍之间悄无声息地移动，然后慢慢、安静地施展仪式。一旦奥德瓦尔德完成了仪式，他会把无用的仪式页丢弃在一个角落，让角色们能找到它，试图嫁祸给校园里的另一个死灵法师。如果角色们搜索出现阴影的地方，他们会找到这张页。进行一次 DC 16 的智力检定({@skill Arcana}) 将揭示出这张羊皮纸上刻着的黑暗符文与特别邪恶的死灵魔法有关。符文中的所有魔法都已耗尽。",
	"Odwald's ritual curses the characters, causing their {@creature shadow} to detach and become an undead creature in the character's likeness. The shadows each attack the character to which they are closest, and if in an area of dim light they will use their bonus action to hide immediately before making their attack. Party members in the main areas of the library will be in conditions of bright light, while those between the shelves will be in areas of dim light. If anyone calls for help, Odwald, still disguised as Mordane, will hear it but ignore their pleas.": "奥德瓦尔德的仪式诅咒角色，导致他们的{@creature shadow}分离并变成一个与角色相似的不死生物。每个阴影都会攻击离它最近的角色，如果处于昏暗光线区域，它们会在发动攻击前立即使用额外动作躲藏起来。在图书馆主要区域的队员将处于明亮光线条件下，而在书架之间的队员将处于昏暗光线区域。如果有人呼救，仍然伪装成莫丹的奥德瓦尔德会听到但会无视他们的请求。",
	"Once the shadows are defeated, Odwald will arrive and make excuses for his absence at the onset of battle. He'll tell a story about having to return some terribly fragile evocation scrolls to a far-away section of the library. If any characters doubt this story, have them make opposed Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) checks against Odwald's Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check. Odwald makes this check with advantage. He knows this library like the back of his talon and can easily lead the characters to the exact section where he placed the tomes earlier to set up this alibi.": "一旦阴影被打败，奥德瓦尔德将到来并为自己在战斗开始时缺席做出解释。他会讲述一个关于不得不将一些极其脆弱的唤醒卷轴送回图书馆遥远区域的故事。如果有角色对这个故事表示怀疑，让他们对奥德瓦尔德的魅力（{@skill Deception}）检定进行对抗性智力（{@skill Insight}）检定。奥德瓦尔德在这次检定中获得优势。他对这个图书馆了如指掌，可以轻松地带领角色到达他之前放置卷轴的确切区域，以此为 co 证。",
	"If a party member succeeds, let it be known Mordane is hiding something, but don't reveal exactly what. A good thing to note is that a party member's success should put him on a list of potential suspects for the strange occurrences on campus, not force the final encounter early. If pressured, Odwald would likely keep up his ruse, and even call security on the party if they try a heavy-handed tactic like resorting to intimidation.": "如果一名队伍成员成功，让他们知道莫丹(Mordane)在隐瞒一些事情，但不要透露具体内容。需要注意的是，队伍成员的成功应该让他成为校园奇怪事件的潜在嫌疑人名单上，而不是提前触发最终对决。如果受到压力，奥德瓦尔德(Odwald)可能会继续装聋作哑，甚至在队伍采取像诉诸恐吓这样的强硬手段时，他可能会报警保安。",
	"Regardless of the conversation, Odwald will ask if the party requires aid, and if any have been injured he will use his faculty amulet to contact Avium security and medics. The party members will be escorted to the infirmary, where healers will tend to their wounds and examine them with divination magic. The healers will ask any characters who've taken Strength damage to finish a short rest in the infirmary, to make sure the curse of undeath is fully purged. Characters should return to normal after completing a short or long rest.": "无论谈话的内容如何，奥德瓦尔德(Odwald)都会询问队伍是否需要帮助，如果有人受伤，他将使用他的法术护符联系阿维姆(Avium)的安全人员和医疗人员。队伍成员将被护送到医务室，在那里治疗师将治疗他们的伤口，并用占卜魔法检查他们。治疗师会要求任何受到力量伤害的角色在医务室完成短暂休息，以确保不死诅咒被完全清除。角色在完成短暂或长时间休息后应该恢复正常。",
	"This isn't recommended, but should the decision be made to force the final encounter early—if the party isn't the type for mysteries—this section will detail how they can proceed from this point. Make sure to read everything from {@adventure The Secret Door|HWAitW|4|The Secret Door} to get a rough idea of the dungeon the party will be going into.": "这并不被推荐，但如果决定提前强制进行最终遭遇——如果队伍不喜欢谜题的话，本节将详细说明他们可以如何从这一点继续。确保从{@adventure The Secret Door|HWAitW|4|The Secret Door}开始阅读，以对队伍即将进入的地牢有一个大致的了解。",
	"If at any point \"Mordane\" is presumed to be behind the strange happenings, make sure the disguised Odwald has time to escape from the party (with his spells he should have plenty of ways to evade them). Then, have him flee through his secret passageway, which the party must uncover in order to continue their pursuit.": "如果在任何时候认为“莫丹”（Mordane）是这些奇怪事件的幕后黑手，请确保伪装的奥德瓦尔德（Odwald）有时间逃离派对（凭借他的法术，他应该有很多逃避的方法）。然后，让他逃离通过他的秘密通道，而派对必须揭开这个秘密通道才能继续追赶。",
	"The party can even appeal to the Dean for help, as Dean Windsworth would now be forced to agree that something suspicious seems to have happened to Mordane.": "团队甚至可以向院长寻求帮助，因为现在迫使院长温兹沃斯（Dean Windsworth）同意莫丹似乎发生了可疑的事情。",
	"If Odwald made it to his laboratory, he'll stay hidden there, working on his calculations. Because he knows the party is coming, he will have the {@creature cobblefright|HWCS} guarding {@adventure The Old Classroom|HWAitW|4|The Old Classroom} to make it easier for him to escape.": "如果奥德瓦尔德成功到达他的实验室，他会藏身在那里，继续进行他的计算工作。因为他知道冒险小组即将到来，他会让{@creature cobblefright|HWCS}守卫{@adventure The Old Classroom|HWAitW|4|The Old Classroom}，以便更容易逃脱。",
	"The day after the party's encounter with the shadows, they will be awoken by a knock on their dormitory door. Professor Birchwalker will inform the party that the Dean wishes to see them as soon as possible. The party will find the Dean in his office in a nervous state. He'll ask them to shut the door moments after entering.": "在与阴影的那次遭遇之后的第二天，派对成员将被宿舍门外的敲门声惊醒。白树行教授会告诉派对成员，院长希望尽快见到他们。派对成员会发现院长在他的办公室里，神情紧张。他们一进门，院长会要求他们立刻关上门。",

I... uh, don't mean to alarm you, but several strange things have been reported across campus and... well, this college was made by powerful wizards, and... we haven't really figured out everything those old codgers left hidden here. Magical defenses and the like. We've had a few uh...accidents in the past. I hope that isn't the case...but if it is, well, you folks are the Defenders of Alderheart, right?

	"The Dean will elaborate if the characters have questions. He's received odd reports from across campus, and believes them to be the result of some as yet undiscovered magical defense built into the Avium being accidentally triggered. He has a few leads that might help the party find out what's happening. Normally, the Dean would trust such investigations to the Perch Guard, but he has so little to go on at this point that he'd rather not involve them if it turns out to be something minor. If the party mentions anything suspicious on the part of the faculty, the Dean will insist they gather sufficient proof first. He trusts his staff and will need hard evidence before he can even consider the possibility of one of them being to blame. The Dean outlines three leads for the party to follow-up on:": "如果角色有问题，院长会详细说明。他收到了校园各处的奇怪报告，认为这可能是由于一些尚未发现的魔法防御机制误触发导致的结果。他有一些线索可能帮助队伍找出正在发生的事情。通常情况下，院长会将这样的调查交给(Perch Guard)，但目前他所知甚少，如果结果证明只是一些小事，他宁愿不牵扯他们进来。如果队伍提到教职员工有可疑行为，院长会坚持他们先收集足够的证据。他信任自己的员工，必须有确凿的证据，他才会考虑其中一人可能是罪魁祸首的可能性。院长为队伍概述了三个线索需要跟进：",
	"A poor student, {@creature Figory Figgins|HWCS}, is a skittish jerbeen who recently applied for sick leave. He filed reports about experiencing something unusual and frightening on campus. Most people think he's exaggerating to gain a medical exemption from classes, but the Dean believes something scared Figory. In truth, Figory was attacked by the {@creature cobblefright|HWCS}, and was afflicted when it drained some of his vitality. The party will find Figory in the first year dormitories in the central building, near the ground floor (see {@adventure The Unnerved Underachiever|HWAitW|4|The Unnerved Underachiever}).": "一个贫穷的学生，{@creature Figory Figgins|HWCS}，是一只胆小的杰尔宾，最近申请了病假。他报告称在校园里经历了一些不寻常和可怕的事情。大多数人认为他在夸大其词，以获取免修课程的医疗豁免，但院长相信费戈里确实受到了惊吓。事实上，费戈里被{@creature cobblefright|HWCS}袭击，当它吸取了他的一些活力时，他受到了影响。队伍会在中央建筑物的一年级宿舍楼里找到费戈里，在地面楼层附近（见{@adventure The Unnerved Underachiever|HWAitW|4|The Unnerved Underachiever}）。",
	"{@creature Corvax Revayne|HWCS}, a dusk corvum divination instructor, has made cryptic predictions, regarding a bad event that's either going to, or already has happened on the campus. He's a brilliant scholar, but also a bit of an oddball. It would be of great help if the party could check in and see what exactly the old corvum has predicted. It might be related to the events on campus. He has an office in the central building, but he can be found in the divination lab in one of the outer spires (see {@adventure A Disturbed Diviner|HWAitW|4|A Disturbed Diviner}).": "{@creature Corvax Revayne|HWCS}，一位黄昏乌鸦占卜导师，已经做出了一些神秘的预言，关于校园里要发生或已经发生的不好事件。他是一位杰出的学者，但也有点怪异。如果冒险小组能够前去查看，看看这只老乌鸦究竟预言了什么，将会非常有帮助。这可能与校园里发生的事件有关。他在中央建筑物里有一个办公室，但也可能在外围尖塔中的占卜实验室里（见{@adventure A Disturbed Diviner|HWAitW|4|A Disturbed Diviner}）。",
	"A studious sera luma named {@creature Jell Platena|HWCS} has lodged a complaint about the servitor skeletons on campus acting oddly. It's minor, but it might be worth looking into. Jell doesn't know this, but what she saw was the direct result of Odwald controlling the servitor skeletons to help in his research. She can be found in one of the libraries in the inner spires (see {@adventure The Apprehensive Apprentice|HWAitW|4|The Apprehensive Apprentice}).": "一位勤奋的塞拉鲁玛，名为{@creature Jell Platena|HWCS}，已经就校园里的仆役骷髅表现异常提出了投诉。这可能只是小问题，但值得调查一下。Jell并不知道，但她所看到的是奥德瓦尔德控制仆役骷髅来帮助他的研究。她可以在内塔尖的其中一个图书馆找到（见{@adventure The Apprehensive Apprentice|HWAitW|4|The Apprehensive Apprentice}）。",

They can also try a more subtle route, such as claiming they were sent to check up on his health. Figory, really does feel burdened with his secret, but he isn't convinced people will believe him.": "如果队伍解释他们来这里是为了询问Figory，他会关上门并要求他们离开。队伍可以通过一次DC 14魅力检定({@skill Persuasion})或一次DC 12魅力检定({@skill Intimidation})说服他让他们进去。他们也可以尝试更加微妙的方式，比如声称他们被派来查看他的健康状况。Figory确实感到他的秘密是个负担，但他并不确信人们会相信他。",
	"Figory looks pale and weak. His face is drained of color and his eyes are heavy, as though he hasn't slept. If the party persuaded their way in or otherwise entered in a non-threatening way, Figory will open up and tell them his story.

	"If the party asks around to see if other students heard or saw anything, there will be no corroboration. It was raining heavily, and even Figory will admit to only being able to hear the creature faintly through the downpour.

	"The marks on the trunk are faded and subtler than one would expect from Figory's story. These are leftover from the transmutation magic Odwald used to cover up the damage done by his escaped cobblefright creation. Any wizard specializing in transmutation can instantly identify magical tampering on the trunk upon examination. Such a character would also be able to tell that whoever covered up these markings wasn't a specialist transmuter: there are differences in the way the magic was used here, and a true master of this magical school could have blended these markings seamlessly.

	"If showed the bones from {@adventure The Unnerved Underachiever|HWAitW|4|The Unnerved Underachiever}, Professor Revayne will cast {@spell detect magic} on them, and report the necromantic aura. This is outside of his area of expertise, but he'll postulate they might be from one of the servitor skeletons that perform menial tasks throughout the school. If the party tells the professor about the creature Figory described, he'll be unnerved and caution them to proceed carefully. Necromancy is only taught in theory at the Avium, and the servitor skeletons are all former faculty members or alumni who willingly donated their remains to the College after a natural death. If anyone were to have created something else, it would surely be cause for alarm. Either way, if Professor Revayne found or heard that the bones appear to have an aura of necromancy about them, he'll direct the party to {@creature Glinda Nightseed|HWCS}, a professor of theoretic necromancy (see {@adventure The Necromancer|HWAitW|4|The Necromancer}).": "如果向{@adventure The Unnerved Underachiever|HWAitW|4|The Unnerved Underachiever}展示骨骼，Revayne教授会对其施放{@spell detect magic}，并报告有死灵法的气息。这超出了他的专业领域，但他会推测这些骨骼可能来自学校中执行琐碎任务的仆役骷髅之一。如果队伍告诉教授有关Figory描述的生物，他会感到不安，并告诫他们谨慎行事。Avium只在理论上教授死灵法，仆役骷髅都是曾是学校教职工或校友，在自然死亡后自愿捐赠遗体给学院。如果有人创造了其他东西，那肯定会引起警报。无论如何，如果Revayne教授发现或听说骨骼似乎带有死灵法气息，他会指引队伍去找{@creature Glinda Nightseed|HWCS}，一位理论死灵法教授（见{@adventure The Necromancer|HWAitW|4|The Necromancer}）。",
	"It might take the party a bit of time to locate Jell. She's a serious student, and is often on the go from one place to the next for classes, extra credit activities, and her own personal studies. If the party asks around campus, during the day they should be able to find which library she's currently in with a DC 13 Charisma ({@skill Investigation}) check.

	"Professor Nightseed seems nice enough, if a little strange, and she is a skilled necromancer. But the Professor is hiding a secret that makes her seem very suspicious, especially around the subject of the campus' servitor skeletons. She has been using these legal reanimations to practice new ways of imbuing simple undead creatures with greater faculties, on par with the living.

	"The open door leads to a small room that looks like an office (see {@adventure The Study Room|HWAitW|4|The Study Room}).": "打开的门通往一个看起来像办公室的小房间（见{@adventure The Study Room|HWAitW|4|The Study Room}）。",
	"This small stone room smells musty and old. Bookshelves line the walls, though they are mainly empty, and there is a table against the right wall. A cushioned chair sits in the middle of the room. Most of the furniture is old, except for the chair, which appears to be a new addition. A simple wooden door lies to the left.": "这个小石头房间散发着潮湿和陈旧的气味。书架沿着墙壁排列，尽管它们大部分是空的，右墙上有一张桌子。一个软垫椅子坐在房间中间。大部分家具都很旧，除了那把椅子，看起来是最新添加的。一扇简单的木门位于左侧。",
	"When the characters enter the study, they will notice that it's clean, and appears to have seen recent use. The wooden door to the left of the entrance opens into a closet, which contains the real librarian, Mordane Swiftgale. Mordane is standing upright, though his eyes are closed as if he is sleeping, and he's surrounded by a field of swirling gray energy, which has a jelly-like viscosity when touched. He does not appear to be breathing. If Mordane is checked for a pulse, a character will find that he is alive, but his pulse is beating at an incredibly slow rate. It is obvious he's being kept alive and imprisoned by this magic, but a DC 18 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check is required for a character to figure out that necromancy is involved, and that it's holding Mordane in a state of suspended animation. This effect can be dispelled, and counts as a 4th level spell for the purposes of determining the DC of {@spell dispel magic}.": "当角色进入书房时，他们会注意到这里很干净，看起来最近有人使用过。入口左侧的木门通向一个壁橱，里面藏着真正的图书管理员，莫丹·斯威夫盖尔(Mordane Swiftgale)。莫丹直挺挺地站着，尽管他的眼睛闭着，好像在睡觉，周围环绕着一团灰色能量的漩涡，触摸时具有类似果冻的粘稠度。他看起来没有呼吸。如果检查莫丹的脉搏，角色会发现他还活着，但脉搏跳动的速率非常缓慢。很明显他被这种魔法维持着生命并被囚禁，但需要进行一次 DC 18的智力检定，才能发现死灵术(necromancy)的介入，以及它将莫丹保持在悬停状态中。这种效果可以被驱散，对于确定 DC 的目的，它算作4级法术。{@skill Arcana}。{@spell dispel magic}。",
	"A crystal pendant hangs from a hook on the inside of the closet door. The pendant looks familiar, and any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence check, or who has the Sharp Mind trait, will recognize it as the one worn by the birdfolk they know as Mordane. Analyzing the pendant reveals it to possess both moderate transmutation and illusion auras. Anyone who puts on the pendant assumes the appearance of Mordane Swiftgale, and an examination of the character in this form will reveal no magical aura of any kind until the pendant is removed.": "一个水晶吊坠挂在壁橱门内的挂钩上。这个吊坠看起来很熟悉，任何成功通过DC 14的智力检定，或者具有敏锐头脑特质的角色，都会认出它是鸟人Mordane所佩戴的那个。分析吊坠会显示它具有中等的变形和幻术光环。任何戴上这个吊坠的人都会呈现出Mordane Swiftgale的外观，直到吊坠被取下之前，检查这个形态的角色不会显示出任何魔法光环。",
	"The doorway that led into the study is the only exit, and will lead players back to the main hallway.": "通往书房的门是唯一的出口，会将玩家带回到主走廊。",
	"As you and your companions travel down the dim hall, you are met with the unmistakable smell of death. There's no ambient sound here, aside from your own footsteps. You pass by empty rooms, all of which look to have been long abandoned, but soft candlelight seeps out from beneath a closed door at the end of the hallway.": "当你和同伴们沿着昏暗的走廊前行时，被一股无法忽视的死亡气息所笼罩。这里没有环境声音，除了你们自己的脚步声。你们路过空荡荡的房间，所有的房间看起来都已经废弃很久了，但在走廊尽头一扇关着的门下面透出柔和的烛光。",
	"The hallway within 20 feet of the wooden door is guarded by a permanent {@spell alarm} spell, and if the alarm is triggered Odwald will receive a silent signal in his mind.": "木门前20英尺范围内的走廊由一个永久的{@spell alarm}法术守卫着，如果警报被触发，奥德瓦尔德将在他的脑海中收到一个无声信号。",
	"A character that sneaks up to the door without triggering the alarm and presses their ear against the door can hear soft, incomprehensible speech, as if someone is muttering, along with strange clacking noises and a hollow scraping sound. If a character triggers the alarm, however, there will be nothing but eerie silence.": "一个角色悄悄靠近门，将耳朵贴在门上，可以听到轻柔、难以理解的低语声，就像有人在喃喃自语，还伴随着奇怪的咔哒声和空洞的刮擦声。然而，如果角色触发了警报，那么将只会听到诡异的寂静。",
	"The door opens into 40-foot-wide, 80-foot-long classroom containing Odwald and five {@creature birdfolk skeleton|HWCS|birdfolk skeletons}.

	"{@b {@i If the alarm wasn't triggered,}} Odwald will be surprised at the beginning of combat, and will be found seated at a paper strewn desk, doing calculations. His skeletons will still be at their chalkboards when the party opens the door. Odwald can command the skeletons to defend him as a bonus action on his turn.": "{@b {@i If the alarm wasn't triggered,}} 在战斗开始时，奥德瓦尔德将会感到惊讶，被发现坐在一张摆满纸张的桌子前做计算。当冒险队打开门时，他的骷髅们仍然在黑板前。奥德瓦尔德可以在自己的回合中将骷髅命令为他进行防御，作为一个额外动作。",
	"{@b {@i If the party is aware of the alarm,}} through {@spell detect magic} or a similar effect, they can plan to storm the room to try and catch Odwald off guard. If they do this, Odwald will not be surprised, as his alarm will still trigger, but he won't have had time to pull his skeletons into defensive positions either. Roll initiative as normal.": "如果玩家们选择通过{@b {@i If the party is aware of the alarm,}到{@spell detect magic}或类似效果，他们可以计划突袭房间，试图让奥德瓦尔措手不及。如果他们这样做，奥德瓦尔不会感到惊讶，因为他的警报仍会触发，但他也没有时间让他的骷髅进入防御位置。按照正常规则进行先攻检定。",
	"After a round of combat, Odwald will make for the passageway to the left, which leads to a staircase. His primary goal is escape, but he may throw out a spell or two before he does so in order to keep the party off-balance while they fight his minions. If things are looking particularly bad for Odwald he'll use {@spell greater invisibility} to protect himself as he flees. Once Odwald has fled, the skeletons will bar entry to the passageway, lashing out at the party with rusty weapons and sharp, bony talons.": "经过一轮战斗后，奥德瓦尔德将朝左侧的通道走去，通道通往一个楼梯。他的主要目标是逃跑，但在逃跑之前，他可能会施放一两个法术，以使队伍在与他的手下战斗时保持不稳定。如果奥德瓦尔德的情况看起来特别糟糕，他会使用{@spell greater invisibility}来保护自己逃跑。一旦奥德瓦尔德逃走，骷髅将堵住通道的入口，用生锈的武器和尖锐的骨爪袭击队伍。",
	"In the old classroom, the party finds some of the missing pages (see {@adventure Into the Library|HWAitW|4|Into the Library}) on the desk. However, it's clear he's taken some crucial information with him. If they take at least an hour to look through everything here, the party will also have enough information to discover the culprit's name: Odwald Ebonhart.": "在旧教室里，冒险者们在桌子上找到了一些失踪的页面（见{@adventure Into the Library|HWAitW|4|Into the Library}）。然而，很明显他已经带走了一些关键信息。如果他们至少花一个小时查看这里的一切，冒险者们也将获得足够的信息来发现罪犯的名字：奥德瓦尔德·埃邦哈特（Odwald Ebonhart）。",
	"If the party defeats or captures Odwald in {@b The Old Classroom}, then the {@creature cobblefright|HWCS}, no longer able to feel its master's control, will climb the stairs to investigate. Freed from Odwald's command, the cobblefright is hungry for the character's life energy, and any characters attempting to take a short rest in the classroom will soon find it interrupted.": "如果队伍在{@b The Old Classroom}击败或俘虏了奥德瓦尔，那么{@creature cobblefright|HWCS}，不再受主人控制，将爬上楼梯进行调查。解脱于奥德瓦尔的命令，石缝妖渴望角色的生命能量，任何试图在教室里休息片刻的角色很快就会发现被打断。",

	"You find yourself in a macabre laboratory. An assortment of bones lays strewn across the tables, and foul-smelling liquids bubble in pots. The stench of death is gut-wrenching. A terrifying creature lurches towards you, a hulking monstrosity of bone and sinew. It appears to be comprised of hundreds of birdfolk bones, jumbled together to form a roughly humanoid shape. The arms end in several talons intertwined into circular claws, and the creature's face is made from the top halves of two birdfolk skulls, one atop the other. It gazes at you with its four empty red eyes and emits a shriek.": "你发现自己身处一个可怕的实验室。桌子上散落着各种骨骼，锅里冒着恶臭的液体。死亡的气息让人作呕。一个可怕的生物朝你蹒跚而来，一个由骨头和筋肉构成的庞大怪物。它似乎由数百只鸟人的骨头拼凑而成，混在一起形成一个粗略的人形。手臂末端有几只爪子交织成圆形的爪子，生物的脸由两个鸟人头骨的上半部分组成，一个叠在另一个上面。它用四只空洞的红色眼睛凝视着你，并发出尖叫。",
	"As long as Odwald is near, the cobblefright won't go on the offensive unless the order is given, but it stands ready to defend itself or its master. Have Odwald say:": "只要奥德瓦尔德(Odwald)在附近，这只鹅卵石恐怪(cobblefright)不会主动进攻，除非收到命令，但它会随时准备好保护自己或它的主人。请让奥德瓦尔德说：",
	"\"You don't understand what you're doing. Stay out of my way!\"": "\"你不明白你在做什么。别挡道！\"",
	"Given the chance, Odwald will explain his plans, detailing his creation of the cobblefright from deceased birdfolk, and telling of how he stole the information he needed to stop the aspect. The aspect is immortal, and the only sure way to defeat it for good is to drain its vital energies through necromancy. To Odwald, stopping the aspect is worth any risk. He is condescending to the party at every opportunity. He is arrogant, and doesn't think the Defenders of Alderheart could possibly understand what he sees as necessary steps to stop the aspect. He is also deeply afraid for the future of the Wood, and doesn't believe the party can be trusted to defeat the aspect on their own.": "如果有机会，奥德瓦尔德将解释他的计划，详细描述他如何利用已故的鸟人创造了石魔，以及他是如何窃取所需信息来阻止这个面相的。这个面相是不朽的，唯一确保永久击败它的方法是通过死灵术来吸取它的生命能量。对于奥德瓦尔德来说，阻止这个面相是值得冒任何风险的。他在任何机会都对队伍表现出傲慢态度。他自负并认为奥尔德哈特的守护者们不可能理解他认为是必要的阻止面相的步骤。他对木之未来深感恐惧，不相信队伍能够独自击败这个面相。",
	"Depending on if the party hears him out or not, it may be possible to talk Odwald out of moving forward with his plan. Even if they may not be able to argue logic with Odwald, he might listen if the party can make an emotional appeal. Though Odwald acts as if his plan has been well-considered, he is entirely motivated by fear, and he hasn't actually given himself time to think through the consequences of his actions. Any character who can convince him that he's not thinking clearly may help him recognize his folly.": "根据派对是否听取他的意见，可能有可能说服奥德瓦尔德(`Odwald`)放弃他的计划。即使他们可能无法用逻辑与奥德瓦尔德(`Odwald`)争辩，如果派对能够做出情感上的呼吁，他可能会倾听。尽管奥德瓦尔德(`Odwald`)表现得好像他的计划经过深思熟虑，但他完全是出于恐惧的动机，并没有真正给自己时间去思考他行动的后果。任何一个能够说服他认识到自己思维不清晰的角色，都可能帮助他意识到自己的愚蠢。",
	"If the party manages to reason with him, create tension by having Odwald lose control of the cobblefright just as he is about to surrender quietly. Fearing for his life, Odwald's cowardice will compel him to flee, apologizing as he leaves the party to fight his mistake. Though, if reasoned with, Odwald will return after the battle to face his demons, and offer to let the party turn him in to the Dean.": "如果队伍设法和他理论，通过让奥德瓦尔德在他即将安静投降时失去对石魔的控制来制造紧张气氛。由于害怕生命安危，奥德瓦尔德的懦弱会驱使他逃跑，在离开队伍时道歉，让队伍去应对他的错误。然而，如果被说服，奥德瓦尔德将在战斗后回来面对他的内心恶魔，并提出让队伍把他送交给院长。",
	"If the party attacks Odwald, or fails to reason with him, he will order the cobblefright to hold them off while he flees. Though he intends for the cobblefright to do this nonlethally, the creature's corrupted and evil nature will cause it to attack with maximum violence.": "如果冒险小组攻击奥德瓦尔德，或未能与他进行理性交涉，他将命令石怪阻挡他们，同时他自己逃跑。尽管他打算让石怪以非致命方式行动，但这个生物被腐化和邪恶的本性会导致它以最大的暴力进行攻击。",

	"If a character attempts to capture a retreating Odwald, allow the character following him as he flees to try and catch up to him, but give Odwald a 60-foot head-start.

Instead, he will turn {@condition invisible} and attempt to lose any character chasing him in the winding passageways.": "如果一个角色试图捕捉一个正在撤退的奥德瓦尔德，允许角色在他逃跑时跟随他，但给予奥德瓦尔德60英尺的领先优势。奥德瓦尔德不会攻击追逐者，除非绝对必要以避免被捕。相反，他会转身{@condition invisible}，试图在曲折的通道中摆脱任何追赶他的角色。",

	"Provided that the characters broke none of the Avium's rules, the Dean welcomes each character back to study, seek information in the libraries, or even to teach a class if they possess the requisite skills and interest to do so. Additionally, the Dean offers a {@item ring of spell storing}, which contains the {@spell stellar bodies|HWCS} spell, cast by him at 5th level, along with two {@item potion of resistance|dmg|potions of resistance} which grant resistance to fire damage.

Other party members may suffer the same fate for failing to report such a dangerous tome and return it to those trained in its proper care. At the Dean's behest, any banned characters may be granted restricted, temporary access to the Avium. The Avium will still provide any aid the Defenders of Alderheart might require to quell the threat of the aspect, but only under strict supervision.

However, as Odwald explains the gravity of the situation, the Dean will take a moment to consider.

According to Odwald's notes, he blamed himself for the awakening of the aspect, but the details of how Odwald might have been involved are unclear. Among them, however, are scrawlings of a prophecy predicting that a member of the Ebonhart family would be the one to finally heal the Wood from the effects of the Great Calamity.": "{@b {@i If Odwald was slain,}}院长将揭示一些关于奥德瓦尔德背景的有趣信息。他会告诉玩家们，奥德瓦尔德是来自奥尔德哈特的著名贵族Ebonhart家族的成员。他过去是一名冒险者，也是Avium的校友。院长似乎对这样一个杰出的学者转向黑暗艺术感到悲伤。根据奥德瓦尔德的笔记，他责怪自己唤醒了这个力量，但奥德瓦尔德可能如何参与其中的细节尚不清楚。然而，在这些笔记中，有一段预言，预言Ebonhart家族的成员将最终治愈大灾难对森林的影响。",
	"In his research, Odwald also found writings about a mystical artifact called {@i the Borealus}, which was hidden sometime after the Great Calamity. He discovered records of its creation, penned by the wizard who crafted, stored it in the Avium's lower library. Using these valuable notes, Odwald theorized a ritual that might utilize this artifact's power to seal the aspect of fire. He had abandoned the ritual in favor of the cobblefright, because he couldn't ascertain whether or not the records of the artifact were genuine. However, scribbles in the margins of his notebook hint that he was considering contacting someone he knew from his adventuring days to help him divine its location.": "在他的研究中，奥德瓦尔德还发现了关于一个名为{@i the Borealus}的神秘神器的文献，这个神器在大灾变之后的某个时候被隐藏起来。他发现了有关神器创造的记录，这些记录是由那位将其制作并储存在阿维姆下层图书馆的巫师撰写的。奥德瓦尔德利用这些宝贵的笔记推测出一种仪式，可能可以利用这个神器的力量来封印火之本质。他放弃了这个仪式，转而选择了石块妖，因为他无法确定神器的记录是否真实。然而，在他笔记本的页边空白处的涂鸦暗示着他曾考虑联系他从冒险时代认识的某人，帮助他揭示神器的位置。",
	"At this point, {@i the Borealus} may be the best lead the party has for a way to defeat the aspect. The Dean will ask them to travel to Alderheart and speak with the companion mentioned in Odwald's notes, a hedge witch named {@creature Susan of the Swamp|HWCS} (if Susan is dead, see the {@adventure Should the Worst Have Happened|HWAitW|5|Friendship with Riffin}). While they do this, the Dean will look over the formulae Odwald used, to see if he might be able to perform this ritual. However, the ritual clearly won't work without the power of {@i the Borealus} (skip to {@adventure Susan the Seer|HWAitW|5|Susan the Seer}).": "此时，{@i the Borealus} 可能是派对找到击败该面相的最佳线索。院长会要求他们前往奥尔德哈特，与奥德瓦尔德笔记中提到的同伴交谈，一个名叫{@creature Susan of the Swamp|HWCS}的篱笆女巫（如果苏珊已经死了，请参见{@adventure Should the Worst Have Happened|HWAitW|5|Friendship with Riffin}）。在他们这样做的同时，院长将检查奥德瓦尔德使用的公式，看看他是否能执行这个仪式。然而，循环清楚地表明没有{@i the Borealus} 的力量，这个仪式是行不通的（跳至{@adventure Susan the Seer|HWAitW|5|Susan the Seer}）。",
	"If the players wish to inform {@creature Riffin, the Ash-Knight|HWCS} of Odwald's demise, have them run into him in Alderheart. He is once again at the Wooden Flagon, retracing his steps in the hopes of meeting Odwald along the way. Riffin will be saddened to hear about the loss of his friend, but he will remain confident that even if Odwald seemed bad, he had a good heart. Riffin will offer to help the party in any way he can, something which may become necessary in {@adventure Facing the Aspect|HWAitW|5|Facing the Aspect}.": "如果玩家希望通知{@creature Riffin, the Ash-Knight|HWCS}奥德瓦尔德(Odwald)的死讯，让他们在奥尔德哈特(Alderheart)遇到他。他再次出现在木制酒旗(Wooden Flagon)，沿着他的脚印寻找奥德瓦尔德的希望。里芬(Riffin)会对失去朋友感到悲伤，但他仍然相信，即使奥德瓦尔德看起来很坏，他的内心是善良的。里芬将提供帮助给队伍，这在{@adventure Facing the Aspect|HWAitW|5|Facing the Aspect}可能会变得必要。",
	"If Odwald was apprehended, the party will receive a summons from the Dean to convene in his office. When the party arrives Odwald will be there, waiting beside Dean Windsworth. Odwald has some kind of silver bangles affixed to his wrists, which the Dean explains are necessary to prevent Odwald from using magic.": "如果奥德瓦尔德被逮捕，队伍将收到院长的传票，要求在他的办公室集合。当队伍到达时，奥德瓦尔德将在那里，站在温兹沃斯院长旁边等待。奥德瓦尔德的手腕上戴着一些银色手镯，院长解释说这是为了防止奥德瓦尔德使用魔法。",
	"The old corvum wishes to pursue a lead that could reveal the location of a magical artifact called {@i the Borealus}, a weapon that may seal away the aspect's energies and return it to a dormant state beneath the Grove. It was a coincidence that Odwald stumbled upon historical accounts of this artifact, and while he isn't convinced it exists or whether the ritual he's created will work, it's the only thing he can think of that might stop the aspect from continually being reborn.": "老乌鸦希望追踪一条线索，可能会揭示一个叫做{@i the Borealus}的魔法物品的位置，这是一件可能封印住本质能量并将其返回到树林下休眠状态的武器。奥德瓦尔德偶然发现了关于这件物品的历史记载，虽然他并不确定它是否存在，以及他所创造的仪式是否有效，但这是他能想到的唯一可能阻止本质不断重生的方法。",
	"The Council has granted Odwald permission to join the party in order to follow up on this lead. He is to stay within sight of the party at all times, until the aspect of fire has been dealt with. Afterwards, Odwald must be brought to Alderheart for trial and sentencing. Characters may have reservations about teaming up with Odwald, but there's no other choice. The Dean is clearly suspicious of Odwald, but the necromancer's research has granted him a situational awareness that the Dean would need time to grasp. Furthermore, Odwald's past experience as an adventurer means he knows his way around the Wood. If Odwald attempts to flee, the party is to apprehend him at once and deliver him to Alderheart.": "议会已经允许奥德瓦尔德（Odwald）加入队伍，以便跟进这个线索。他必须始终保持在队伍的视线范围内，直到火焰元素问题得到解决。之后，奥德瓦尔德必须被带到奥尔德哈特（Alderheart）接受审判和判决。角色们可能对与奥德瓦尔德合作有所保留，但现在别无选择。院长显然对奥德瓦尔德持怀疑态度，但这位死灵法师的研究使他具备了院长需要时间才能领会的情境意识。此外，奥德瓦尔德作为一名冒险者的过往经验意味着他熟悉这片森林。如果奥德瓦尔德试图逃跑，队伍必须立即逮捕他并将他送到奥尔德哈特。",
	"If the party apprehends Odwald, once given leave to assist the party, Odwald will help them willingly. Time has made him reflect on his actions, and he feels great shame. He is now committed to fixing his mistakes in the right way. Odwald will offer the party every assistance they might require, and he will even share a bit about his background to any characters who are curious.": "如果队伍逮捕了奥德瓦尔德，一旦获准协助队伍，奥德瓦尔德将乐意帮助他们。时间让他反思自己的行为，他感到非常羞愧。他现在致力于以正确的方式纠正自己的错误。奥德瓦尔德将为队伍提供一切可能需要的帮助，甚至会向任何对他背景感兴趣的角色分享一些信息。",
	"During their travels, determine when it fits the narrative flow for Odwald to share information regarding his family, researching {@i the Borealus}, and his longtime friend, Riffin.": "在旅行中，确定何时适合Odwald分享关于他的家庭，研究{@i the Borealus}以及他的老朋友Riffin的信息，以符合叙事流程。",
	"When role-playing Odwald, remember that he is prideful and cowardly, but also intelligent and deeply concerned for the well-being of the Wood. He sees everything that has happened up to now as a personal failing, and while he's finally willing to ask others for help, in the end, he still feels responsible for the current state of the Wood.": "在扮演奥德瓦尔德时，请记住他骄傲胆小，但也聪明并深切关心着森林的幸福。他认为到目前为止发生的一切都是个人失误，虽然他终于愿意向他人寻求帮助，但最终，他仍然觉得对森林当前的状态负有责任。",
	"Odwald is a member of the noble Ebonhart family, one of the founding families of Alderheart.": "Odwald是贵族Ebonhart家族的成员，是Alderheart的创始家族之一。",
	"\"My family holds a generations-old prophecy that an Ebonhart will be the one to finally heal the Wood from the Great Calamity that birthed the Scorched Grove. For many years I believed it would be me, but the more I learned, the less I knew about the fundamental nature of the problem. Six months ago I was granted a vision. An entity visited me in a dream and imparted knowledge of the aspect's existence. It showed me the location of the seal, and told me of the spells I might use to heal the Grove of the aspect's influence once and for all.\"": "\"我的家族传承着一个世代相传的预言，说一个黑心者将会最终治愈那片因大灾难而诞生的焦林。多年来，我一直认为那个人会是我，但我学到的越多，我对问题的本质了解就越少。六个月前，我得到了一个启示。一个实体在梦中拜访了我，并传授了有关这个本质存在的知识。它向我展示了封印的位置，并告诉我可以使用的咒语，以彻底治愈焦林受本质影响的方法。\"",
	"The entity that spoke to Odwald in his dream kept its true form hidden. All he could hear was a voice that sounded very old and felt wise beyond the understanding of any mortal. He went to the conjuration circle in the Grove and found it unusually active, as if it was already weakening. He panicked, and used the spells he was shown to try and cleanse the aspect's energy. Instead, the sigil flared up, and shortly thereafter the fires began to spread.": "在奥德瓦尔德（Odwald）梦中与他交谈的实体隐藏了其真实形态。他只能听到一种听起来非常古老且智慧超越任何凡人理解的声音。他前往格罗夫（Grove）中的召唤圈，并发现它异常活跃，仿佛已经在削弱。他感到恐慌，试图使用他所展示的咒语来净化这个形态的能量。然而，符文却突然闪烁起来，不久之后火势开始蔓延。",
	"If asked why he did it, Odwald will reply:": "如果被问及为什么他这样做，奥德瓦尔德将会回答：",
	"\"I was a damned fool. All these years I've spent, afraid of failing to live up to my family's name. It was this same fear that caused me to act so recklessly. I should never have listened to that blasted voice... and now my actions may have doomed Humblewood.\"": "\"我真是个该死的傻瓜。这些年来，我一直害怕辜负家族的名声。正是这种恐惧让我如此鲁莽行事。我不应该听那该死的声音...现在我的行为可能已经毁了《(Humblewood)》。\"",
	"If any characters ask Odwald about his knowledge of {@i the Borealus}, he will relate the following points of information:": "如果任何角色询问奥德瓦尔德关于他对{@i the Borealus}的了解，他会提到以下信息点：",
	"He stumbled across an old legend mentioning {@i the Borealus} many years ago, but it was only since returning to the Avium that he managed to find a collection of laboratory notes claiming to be from the wizard who crafted it.": "他偶然发现了一个提及{@i the Borealus}许多年前的古老传说，但直到回到阿维姆（Avium）后，他才找到了一本实验室笔记集合，声称是由制造它的巫师所写。",
	"Because of these notes, Odwald concedes that such an item could have been created. If it was indeed constructed, its power would not only be tremendous, but also uniquely suited to counter the elemental energies of the aspect.": "由于这些笔记，奥德瓦尔德（Odwald）承认这样的物品可能已经被创造出来。如果它确实被制造出来，它的力量不仅巨大，而且也独特地适合对抗该要素的元素能量。",
	"Based on his research, he has theorized a way to use {@i the Borealus} along with the conjuration circle to re-seal the aspect. However, this isn't something he could test, and coupled with the uncertainty of {@i the Borealus'} existence, it seemed like this avenue had too small a chance of success.": "根据他的研究，他推测了一种使用{@i the Borealus}以及召唤阵圈来重新封印该要素的方法。然而，这并非他能够测试的事情，再加上{@i the Borealus'}存在的不确定性，似乎这条途径成功的机会太小。",
	"Since his recent research on spellcrafting (trying to create a spell that mimics the cobblefright's siphon soul ability), he has hit upon some new documents, which have increased his confidence in the chances of success for a ritual using {@i the Borealus}... but there's still no way to be sure.": "最近他在咒语制作方面的研究（试图创造一个模仿石魔的灵魂虹吸能力的咒语）取得了一些新的文献，这增加了他对使用{@i the Borealus}进行仪式成功的信心，但仍然无法确定。",
	"Odwald will add that this gamble may be the Wood's last hope, as his studies have indicated the aspect will continue to grow in strength the longer it remains un-sealed. He only hopes that {@i the Borealus} still resides in the Wood, because their time is short.": "奥德瓦尔德会补充说，这场赌博可能是伍德（the Wood）的最后希望，因为他的研究表明，这个力量会随着时间的推移而不断增强，只要它保持未封印状态。他只希望{@i the Borealus}仍然在伍德（the Wood）中，因为他们的时间不多了。",
	"If any player asks about Riffin, or brings up that the strig knight has been looking for Odwald, he will evince a combination of relief and sorrow. He and Riffin were once adventurers who traveled Humblewood together. Odwald was staying with Riffin in Ashbarrow when the fires claimed it. He and Riffin helped people evacuate, but during the chaos a building collapsed and seriously injured Riffin. Odwald saved him and brought him to Alderheart. Burdened as Odwald was by the knowledge that he was responsible for the fires that destroyed Riffin's home, he couldn't bear to stay.": "如果有任何玩家询问关于瑞芬（Riffin），或提到那位弦骑士一直在寻找奥德瓦尔德（Odwald），他会表现出一种既宽慰又悲伤的情绪。他和瑞芬曾是一起在《谦木林》（Humblewood）旅行的冒险者。奥德瓦尔德在火灾中夺去了瑞芬的家园——阿什巴洛（Ashbarrow）。他和瑞芬帮助人们疏散，但在混乱中一栋建筑倒塌，严重伤及了瑞芬。奥德瓦尔德救了他并将他带到了奥尔德哈特（Alderheart）。奥德瓦尔德背负着自己是导致瑞芬家园被毁的火灾的责任，无法忍受留下来。",
	"\"It was then I resolved to find a way to correct my mistakes, by any means necessary. It seems all I've succeeded in doing is hurting others. I should have asked for help but... perhaps I couldn't accept the idea that it wasn't possible to quell the aspect alone.\" He scoffs, \"My own selfish pride as a chosen son of Ebonhart is to blame. I am truly sorry for the way I acted toward you all.\"": "\"就在那时，我决定想尽一切办法来纠正我的错误。看起来我所做的一切只是伤害了别人。我本应该寻求帮助，但是...也许我无法接受这样一个想法，即独自平息这个局面是不可能的。\" 他冷笑道，\"作为黑心之子的自私傲慢应该为此负责。我对我对你们所有人的行为感到非常抱歉。\"",
	"Odwald still feels great shame because of his actions, but he will acknowledge that he needs to make amends with Riffin. Besides, Riffin is a capable warrior, and his assistance might prove valuable if they are to face the aspect. Odwald has a good idea where his old friend might be found (skip to {@adventure The Perch of Brackenmill|HWAitW|5|The Perch of Brackenmill}).": "奥德瓦尔德仍然因为自己的行为感到羞愧，但他会承认他需要与里芬和解。此外，里芬是一名能干的战士，如果他们要面对{@adventure The Perch of Brackenmill|HWAitW|5|The Perch of Brackenmill}的话，他的帮助可能会很有价值。奥德瓦尔德对他的老朋友可能会被找到的地方有一个好主意。",
	"If the subject of Riffin never comes up, Odwald will suggest the party meet with one of his old adventuring companions, a hedge witch by the name of Susan, who may be able to help point the party toward the location of {@i the Borealus} (skip to {@adventure Susan the Seer|HWAitW|5|Susan the Seer}).": "如果没有提到Riffin这个话题，奥德瓦尔德会建议队伍会见他的一位老冒险同伴，一个名叫苏珊的篱笆女巫，她也许能帮助指引队伍前往{@i the Borealus}的位置（跳至{@adventure Susan the Seer|HWAitW|5|Susan the Seer}）。",
	"If Susan is dead, direct the party to {@creature Ardwyn, Elder of Meadowfen|HWCS} from {@adventure Part 1: The Adventure Begins|HWAitW|1} instead. She was once a formidable priestess of Tyton, and back in Odwald's adventuring days she was known as a talented seer. She should be able to perform a similar ritual to guide the party to {@i the Borealus'} resting place.": "如果苏珊已经去世，就让队伍从{@adventure Part 1: The Adventure Begins|HWAitW|1}而不是{@creature Ardwyn, Elder of Meadowfen|HWCS}前往。她曾经是泰顿神殿的一位强大女祭司，在奥德瓦尔德的冒险时代，她被称为一位才华横溢的先知。她应该能够执行类似的仪式，引导队伍前往{@i the Borealus'}的安息之地。",
	"When the party leaves the Avium, they should be armed with knowledge about the terrifying and deathless nature of the aspect of fire, but also with a clear view of its weaknesses. Depending on what happened to Odwald, they may have a sense of where to look for leads regarding the location of {@i the Borealus}.": "当队伍离开阿维姆时，他们应该了解到火焰之力的可怕和不朽本质，但也清楚地了解它的弱点。根据奥德瓦尔德的遭遇，他们可能会有线索指向寻找{@i the Borealus}的地点。",
	"If Odwald escaped in {@adventure Part 4|HWAitW|4}, then the party's next step is to track him down before he can start more trouble. Have Dean Windsworth or another character impress upon the party that Odwald might have absconded with information from the Avium that could help defeat the aspect once and for all. Therefore, it's important he be captured alive. To help the party achieve this, the Dean will give them a pair of silver bangles, which can be affixed to Odwald to prevent him from using magic. The party's mission is still to quell the aspect, and while Odwald must face justice, the safety of the Wood comes first. Once they apprehend Odwald they are to return him to the Avium for questioning.": "如果奥德瓦尔德在{@adventure Part 4|HWAitW|4}逃脱了，那么队伍接下来的步骤就是在他制造更多麻烦之前追踪他。请温兹沃斯院长或另一位角色向队伍强调，奥德瓦尔德可能带走了阿维姆的信息，这些信息可以帮助彻底击败这个面相。因此，重要的是要活捉他。为了帮助队伍实现这一目标，院长会给他们一对银手镯，可以戴在奥德瓦尔德身上，阻止他使用魔法。队伍的任务仍然是平息这个面相，虽然奥德瓦尔德必须接受审判，但伍德的安全是第一位的。一旦他们逮捕了奥德瓦尔德，就应该将他送回阿维姆接受审讯。",
	"The Dean has informed his most learned professors of the party's situation, and many have offered to help in any way they can. Particularly, the divination professor, {@creature Corvax Revayne|HWCS}, may be able to locate Odwald. The party can meet with Professor Revayne in his office, where he has already made the necessary preparations.": "院长已经告知他最博学的教授们有关派对的情况，许多教授表示愿意尽他们所能来帮助。特别是占卜教授，{@creature Corvax Revayne|HWCS}，可能能够找到奥德瓦尔德。派对可以在雷文教授的办公室与他会面，他已经做好了必要的准备。",
	"Inside this small office, the furniture has been pushed aside to make space for an intricate chalk circle drawn with several flourishes on the flat stone floor. Professor Revayne, still sketching symbols around the circle's edge, is startled by your approach and immediately stands to address you. \"Be careful! This circle must reflect the many threads of fate in order to show what is possible. Erase any of them and we risk inaccuracy!\" He then motions for you to move to the edges of the room.": "在这个小办公室里，家具被推到一边，为了在平坦的石地板上绘制一个复杂的粉笔圆圈，教授雷文(Revayne)正在圆圈边缘绘制符号。你的靠近使他感到惊讶，他立即站起来对你说道：“小心！这个圆圈必须反映出命运的许多纽带，才能展示可能发生的事情。擦掉任何一个都会带来不准确性！”然后他示意你移动到房间的边缘。",
	"Once he finishes a few strokes, or fills in any lines a hapless character may have stepped on, grumbling as he does so, he will lightly hop into the center of the circle. He asks that someone pass him his tools: a crystal on a string, a bowl of water, and a bag of sand, all of which are easily accessible on the nearby table. Professor Revayne carefully places the bowl of water in the center of the circle, and requests silence while he works. He will suspend the crystal over the bowl and begin to incant his spell.": "一旦他完成了几笔，或者填补了任何被不幸角色踩到的线条，一边嘟囔着，他会轻轻地跳进圆圈的中心。他请求有人把他的工具递给他：一根带着水晶的绳子，一碗水，和一袋沙子，这些都很容易在附近的桌子上拿到。雷文教授小心翼翼地把水碗放在圆圈中心，并要求在他工作时保持安静。他会把水晶悬在碗上方，然后开始念咒语。",
	"The air in the room crackles with arcane energy as the pendulum swings back and forth over the bowl of water, which reflects the crystal above like a mirror. The corvum's eyes glow white as he casts a small pinch of sand into the water. It ripples, and images begin to form on its surface. As the pendulum is pulled strongly southeast by an invisible force, you can see tree-farms, wagons filled with goods, and corrals of giant insects. With a gentle \"swoosh\" the circle of chalk lifts from the ground and disappears into vapour, returning both the bowl of water and the professor to normal.": "房间里弥漫着奥术能量，当钟摆来回摆动在水碗上方时，水面反射出水晶的光芒。当(corvum)的眼睛发出白光，他向水中投入一小撮沙子。水面泛起涟漪，图像开始在其表面形成。当钟摆被一股无形的力量朝东南方向拉得很厉害时，你可以看到种树场、装满货物的马车和巨大昆虫的畜栏。随着一声轻柔的“嗖”声，粉笔圈从地面上升起，消失在蒸汽中，将水碗和教授都恢复正常。",
	"Professor Revayne will inform the party that Odwald is in Brackenmill. This place appears to have personal significance to Odwald, though the professor can't guess what it might be. However, the professor is certain the necromancer's form will be veiled in concealing magic. Professor Revayne will also impart that someone else in Brackenmill is looking for Odwald. There was a winged shield in his vision: the one who bears this shield is the key to finding Odwald.": "雷文教授将告知冒险小组，奥德瓦尔在布莱肯磨坊（Brackenmill）附近。这个地方似乎对奥德瓦尔有着个人意义，尽管教授无法猜测这意义是什么。然而，教授确信这个死灵法师的形象将被隐匿的魔法所掩盖。雷文教授还会传达，在布莱肯磨坊还有其他人在寻找奥德瓦尔。他的视野中出现了一个有翅膀的盾牌：持有这个盾牌的人是找到奥德瓦尔的关键。",
	"He will also remind the party that the augury he performed in {@adventure A Disturbed Diviner|HWAitW|4|A Disturbed Diviner} (\"the master weal, the monster woe\") might mean Odwald is a potential ally. He'll caution them against making any rash moves against Odwald, as his vision gave him the impression the necromancer might yet have a part to play in the fate of the Wood.": "他还会提醒队伍，他在{@adventure A Disturbed Diviner|HWAitW|4|A Disturbed Diviner}进行的占卜(\"the master weal, the monster woe\")可能意味着奥德瓦尔德是一个潜在的盟友。他会告诫他们不要轻举妄动对付奥德瓦尔德，因为他的预见让他觉得这位死灵法师可能在木之命运中扮演一定角色。",
	"The professor will also provide the party with a {@item gem of seeing}. This variant of the item grants only the effects of {@spell see invisibility} rather than {@sense truesight}, and it does not regain charges at dawn. Once all its charges have been expended it will become a normal, non-magical gem. Professor Revayne will point out that this item could come in handy if the necromancer attempts to use {@spell invisibility} to escape (as he may have done in their first encounter).": "教授还会为派对提供一个{@item gem of seeing}。这个物品的变种只赋予{@spell see invisibility}的效果，而不是{@sense truesight}，并且它不会在黎明时恢复充能。一旦所有充能用尽，它将变成一个普通的非魔法宝石。雷文教授会指出，如果那个死灵法师尝试使用{@spell invisibility}逃跑（就像他们第一次相遇时可能做的那样），这个物品可能会派上用场。",
	"Armed with new knowledge, players can prepare to set out from the Avium, though it will take about three days on the road to reach Brackenmill. Have this trip be uneventful in order to keep up the game's pace, but hint at the growing power of the aspect by mentioning that the air is much warmer and drier than it was when the party began their journey. The forest also appears quieter than usual as they travel. These are dire times indeed.": "随着新知识的武装，玩家们可以准备离开阿维姆，尽管需要大约三天的路程才能到达布莱肯磨坊(Brackenmill)。为了保持游戏的节奏，让这次旅行平稳无事，但通过提到空气比起队伍开始旅程时更加温暖和干燥来暗示着元素力量的增长。随着他们的旅行，森林也显得比平常安静。这确实是危急时刻。",
	"Since his escape from the Avium, Odwald has reached Brackenmill, where he now weighs his options. His research has been set back to zero, he has none of his materials or laboratory equipment, and while he harbors some idea of how to stop the aspect he isn't certain the artifact even exists, let alone if its powers are truly as strong as he's read. After having had time to reflect, he is painfully aware of the danger he posed to the innocent people at the College. He has also spotted his old friend Riffin in Brackenmill, and a part of him desperately seeks to confess his misdeeds to the strig knight. However, Odwald lacks courage and will simply be trying to lay low. When the Defenders of Alderheart arrive, he is contemplating his next steps.": "自从他逃离了阿维姆(Avium)，奥德瓦尔德已经到达了布莱肯磨坊(Brackenmill)，他现在在权衡自己的选择。他的研究被归零，没有任何材料或实验室设备，虽然他对如何阻止这个面相有一些想法，但他并不确定这个神器是否真的存在，更不用说它的力量是否真的像他所读到的那样强大。经过反思，他痛苦地意识到自己对学院无辜人员构成的危险。他还在布莱肯磨坊发现了他的老朋友里芬(Riffin)，他内心的一部分迫切地希望向那位吸血鬼骑士坦白自己的罪行。然而，奥德瓦尔德缺乏勇气，只会试图保持低调。当奥德海特的守护者(Defenders of Alderheart)到来时，他正在考虑接下来的步骤。",
	"Odwald is using {@spell disguise self} to pose as a traveling huden gallus monk, staying at the Sunny Silkworm Inn. He must limit his interactions with others due to the nature of the spell, but the form he has chosen roughly matches his own size, so the spell is difficult to uncover at a glance. Any player that specifically examines Odwald can make a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to see if something is amiss; for example, if a part of his vestments passes through a table as he moves by. Any physical interaction with Odwald would be enough to detect his illusion, so he'll do his best to deny the party that opportunity by keeping his distance. Odwald endeavours to stay in his rented lodgings for as long as he can, only making appearances in the inn's common room or around town in short intervals, since he must hide and re-cast his spell each hour to maintain its effect. Any player able to scan Odwald with {@spell detect magic} will instantly know he is under the effect of an illusion spell.": "奥德瓦尔德正在使用{@spell disguise self}假扮成一名旅行的胡登加卢斯（Huden Gallus）僧侣，在阳光蚕茧客栈（Sunny Silkworm Inn）住宿。由于咒语的特性，他必须限制与他人的互动，但他选择的形态大致与自己的尺寸相符，所以一眼很难揭穿这个咒语。任何特意检查奥德瓦尔德的玩家可以进行一次DC 15的感知（Wisdom）检定，看看是否有什么不对劲；例如，如果他的衣袍的一部分在他移动时穿过桌子。任何与奥德瓦尔德的身体接触足以发现他的幻象，因此他会尽力避免让队伍有这个机会，保持距离。奥德瓦尔德努力尽可能地待在他租住的住所里，只在客栈的公共休息室或镇上短暂露面，因为他必须每小时隐藏并重新施放他的咒语以保持效果。任何能用{@spell detect magic}扫描奥德瓦尔德的玩家将立即知道他受到幻象咒语的影响。",
	"If he ever feels as though he has been discovered, Odwald will attempt to flee into the forest.": "如果他觉得自己被发现了，奥德瓦尔德(Odwald)会试图逃进森林。",
	"When the party reaches Brackenmill, they'll find themselves looking up at a series of lush tree canopies. These will be immediately recognizable as perch-farms; the boughs are filled with familiar herbs, fruiting vines, and are tended by several farmers. Corrals on the ground house different varieties of giant insects, including giant silkworms, munching on greenery.": "当冒险小组到达布莱肯磨坊（Brackenmill）时，他们会发现自己仰望着一系列郁郁葱葱的树冠。这些树冠会立即被认出是栖息农场；树枝上长满了熟悉的草药、结果实的藤蔓，并由几名农民照料。地面上的畜栏里关着不同品种的巨型昆虫，包括巨型蚕虫，它们正在啃食绿色植物。",
	"Brackenmill is a lively hub for folks of all kinds, and upon seeing travelers, folks will smile and greet them politely, welcoming them to their perch. Steps shaped into the tall trees allow players to climb up to a series of bridges made of wood and rope, and platforms that serve to connect the trees together.": "Brackenmill（布莱肯磨坊）是各种人的热闹中心，看到旅行者时，人们会微笑并礼貌地打招呼，欢迎他们到这里。螺旋状的台阶沿着高大的树木向上延伸，让玩家们可以爬到一系列由木头和绳子构成的桥梁和平台上，连接着树木。",
	"The locals here are a hearty folk, and while busy, they exude a kind of rustic hospitality that is honest and charming. If any characters ask about life in Brackenmill of late, locals will tell them that things have been busy. This season, people have had to work even harder than usual to produce enough crops to aid those displaced by the fires.

Then her eyes return to normal, and Susan regains her senses.": "苏珊一口喝下这杯药水后，她的瞳孔扩张直至眼睛变黑。它们似乎包含着星星和星座，苏珊看起来瞬间变得遥远。然后她的眼睛恢复正常，苏珊重新恢复了神智。",
	"\"What a vision... there are so many possible futures, it's hard to keep track!\" she says, moving to a small bookshelf behind her. \"I saw one great power being kept in check by another. An endless dance of fire and ice.\" Susan then pulls a tome from the shelf and rifles through it. \"{@i the Borealus} wants to be united with the flames. It is barred behind a door of cinders, to which only the Tenders have the key. To reach it you must find... this!\"": "“多么美妙的景象... 有太多可能的未来，让人难以追踪！”她说着，走到她身后的一个小书架旁。“我看到一个伟大的力量被另一个力量所制衡。一场无尽的火与冰之舞。”苏珊然后从书架上拿起一本书，翻阅着。“{@i the Borealus} 想要与火焰合一。 它被禁锢在一扇炭烬之门后，只有守护者才有钥匙。要到达它，你必须找到... 这个！”",
	"Susan will find the page she was looking for, and show it to the party. It's an illustration of a plant that characters proficient in the {@skill Survival} or {@skill Nature} skills can easily recognize as skyleaf, a type of leafy vine that grows around the taller trees in Humblewood. She'll explain her vision showed a sprig of skyleaf would be the key to accessing {@i the Borealus}, and that the artifact still rests in Humblewood, but beyond this she isn't sure. Signs pointed to the Tenders living in Alderheart; a character the party should be familiar with holds the second key to {@i the Borealus'} resting place.": "苏珊会找到她正在寻找的页面，并向队伍展示。这是一幅插图，展示了一种植物，精通{@skill Survival}或{@skill Nature}技能的角色可以轻松识别为天叶，一种在谦卑森林中生长在较高树木周围的藤蔓。她会解释她的幻象显示一小枝天叶将是访问{@i the Borealus}的关键，并且这件神器仍然安息在谦卑森林中，但除此之外她不确定。迹象指向了生活在奥尔德哈特的护卫者；一个队伍应该熟悉的角色拥有{@i the Borealus'}安息之地的第二把钥匙。",
	"Susan will tell the party that skyleaf vines grow in a part of the forest to the northwest, a three hour walk from Alderheart. The party can choose to search for the skyleaf right away (see {@adventure Picking through the Ashes|HWAitW|5|Picking through the Ashes}), or speak to the Tenders (see {@adventure The Wisdom of Tenders|HWAitW|The Wisdom of Tenders}). Remind the players they can also avail themselves of Alderheart's many shops while they're here, including {@adventure Eliza's Emporium|HWAitW|2|Eliza's Emporium}.": "苏珊会告诉队伍，天叶藤生长在森林的西北部分，离奥尔德哈特有三小时的步行路程。队伍可以选择立即寻找天叶藤（见{@adventure Picking through the Ashes|HWAitW|5|Picking through the Ashes}），或者与守护者交谈（见{@adventure The Wisdom of Tenders|HWAitW|The Wisdom of Tenders}）。提醒玩家，他们也可以在这里利用奥尔德哈特的许多商店，包括{@adventure Eliza's Emporium|HWAitW|2|Eliza's Emporium}。",
	"The northwest forests of Alderheart have changed.": "奥尔德哈特（Alderheart）的西北森林发生了变化。",
	"You arrive to see a sparse, burned forest. Ashes litter the branches and cover the forest floor in a thick carpet. To the north, a swath of charred trees is visible in the distance, unmistakably the work of the aspect. It looks like the aspect has been able to push even closer to Alderheart.": "你来到一个稀疏的烧毁森林。灰烬覆盖着树枝，厚厚地铺在森林地面上。向北方望去，远处可见一片烧焦的树木，明显是(Aspect)的杰作。看起来(Aspect)已经成功地向奥尔德哈特(Alderheart)靠近了一步。",
	"The ashes that cover the forest floor are cool, and possess none of the supernatural properties that ashes within the Scorched Grove have, but their presence here is disconcerting. The forest is still, and the familiar sights and sounds of the Wood are conspicuously absent.": "覆盖森林地面的灰烬是凉的，没有烧焦树林内的灰烬那种超自然属性，但它们在这里的存在令人不安。森林寂静无声，木之熟悉景象和声音明显缺失。",
	"A party member will need to make a DC 16 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) or Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check to locate skyleaf among the ash-covered foliage. This search can be done either from the ground or in a tree, but once the leaf is located, a character will need to climb up to retrieve it. Any character attempting to climb a tree must make a DC 14 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check, as skyleaf grows only within the highest branches. After a character has acquired the skyleaf sprig, (preferably while one or more party members are up in a tree) the party will run into an {@creature ashsnake|HWCS} that will try to use the ash cover to ambush a target close enough to the ground. Resolve passive perception checks as normal, and point out that the trees in this part of the forest are in small copses around 80 feet apart, making it difficult (but not impossible) to retreat using glide.": "一个队伍成员需要进行一次DC 16的感知（{@skill Survival}）或智力（{@skill Nature}）检定，才能在被灰覆盖的植被中找到天叶。这个搜索可以在地面上或树上进行，但一旦叶子被找到，角色就需要爬上去取回它。任何试图爬树的角色必须进行一次DC 14的力量（{@skill Athletics}）检定，因为天叶只生长在最高的树枝上。当一个角色获得了天叶嫩枝后（最好是在一个或多个队伍成员在树上时），队伍会遇到一个{@creature ashsnake|HWCS}，它会试图利用灰覆盖来伏击一个靠近地面的目标。按照通常的被动感知检定解决问题，并指出这片森林中的树木分布在大约80英尺的小树丛中，这使得使用滑翔难以（但不是不可能）撤退。",
	"The Tenders the party will find in Alderheart are {@creature Tevor of the Spring Path|HWCS} and {@creature Havel of the Autumn Moon|HWCS}, whom they met in {@adventure Part 3: An Urgent Summons|HWAitW|3}.

	"If Tevor is still alive, Havel and Tevor have begun to live together, and are clearly affectionate toward one another. The harrowing events in the Wood lately have helped deepen their bond, and they now work as partners to train and coordinate the less experienced Tenders. If Tevor died, Havel carries on alone, working hard to honor Tevor's sacrifice.": "如果泰弗(Tevor)还活着，哈维尔(Havel)和泰弗已经开始一起生活，并且彼此之间显然很亲昵。最近在森林中发生的可怕事件帮助加深了他们之间的联系，他们现在作为合作伙伴一起训练和协调经验不足的护卫(Tenders)。如果泰弗去世，哈维尔将独自继续努力，努力尊重泰弗的牺牲。",
	"Either way, whoever is there to meet the party greets them warmly, and will offer up any assistance the Defenders of Alderheart require.": "无论如何，无论谁在那里迎接派对的人，都会热情地问候他们，并将提供任何阿尔德哈特守护者需要的帮助。",
	"Havel is familiar with old Tender legends about {@i the Borealus}. He explains:": "Havel熟悉有关{@i the Borealus}的古老温柔传说。他解释道：",
	"\"The story of {@i the Borealus} tells of a wizard who stole a piece of a powerful spirit of winter. They thought they could control its icy power by containing it within a staff, but instead it froze them. Left to itself, the newly-made artifact kept freezing the land around it. The tales say that the old Tenders felt this imbalance in the Wood. When they found {@i the Borealus}, they had the artifact sealed away by Tender Elders using a sprig of skyleaf, which remains hearty even through the winter.\"": "{@i the Borealus}的故事讲述了一个巫师偷走了冬之强大精神的一部分。他们以为可以通过将其封存在一根法杖中来控制其冰冷的力量，但结果却是被冻结了。这个新制成的法器被留在那里后，不断地冻结着周围的土地。传说说，古老的守护者们感受到了森林中的这种不平衡。当他们找到{@i the Borealus}时，他们让守护者长者们用一根天叶封印了这个法器，这种植物即使在冬天也依然茁壮。",
	"Havel will add that he hadn't placed much stock in the tale, since it's ancient, and he only came across it after a long period of study. When he first read it, he thought the story to be a parable about the dangers of trying to enslave the powers of living elementals. When the party (or Odwald, if he's traveling with them) tells Havel what they know, he'll be surprised and offer to help the Defenders of Alderheart however he can.": "Havel会补充说，他并没有太在意这个故事，因为它很古老，而且他是在长时间的研究之后才偶然发现的。当他第一次阅读时，他认为这个故事是关于试图奴役生命元素力量的危险的寓言。当队伍（或者如果他和他们一起旅行的话，是奥德瓦尔德）告诉Havel他们所知道的事情时，他会感到惊讶，并表示愿意以任何方式帮助阿尔德哈特的守护者。",
	"{@b {@i If Tevor is alive,}} he will reveal some practical information that can help locate {@i the Borealus}. Tevor will recall a story he once heard from his mentor. According to the tale, the fate of an elder who wished to become a Tender Treekeeper was decided by delivering an unburned skyleaf sprig to a frog-shaped rock in the southwest of the Scorched Grove. Havel will support Tevor, and say he believes this agrees with references to an ancient chamber in the Scorched Grove. The text appeared in the historical records around the same time as the stories of {@i the Borealus} being sealed away. Neither Tevor nor Havel can take the party to the location because they're needed in Alderheart, but Tevor can mark it on the party's map. It's a fairly distinctive landmark, so the party should be able to find it easily with this direction.": "{@b {@i If Tevor is alive,}他将透露一些实用信息，可以帮助找到{@i the Borealus}。特沃尔会回忆起他曾从导师那里听到的一个故事。根据这个传说，一个长者想成为一名嫩树守护者的命运取决于将一个未燃烧的天叶嫩枝送到烧焦树林西南部的一个青蛙形状的岩石那里。哈维尔会支持特沃尔，并表示他相信这与烧焦树林中古老密室的参考相符。这段文字出现在历史记录中，大约与{@i the Borealus}被封印的故事同时期。特沃尔和哈维尔都不能带领队伍去那个地点，因为他们需要留在奥尔德哈特，但特沃尔可以在队伍的地图上标记出来。这是一个相当独特的地标，所以队伍应该能够根据这个方向轻松找到它。",
	"{@b {@i If Tevor is dead,}} Havel will admit he doesn't know anything that might hint at the Borealus' location, but he has access to some rather old tomes of lore in the archives of the Tenders' headquarters. If given time to unravel this mystery, Havel might be able to find something of use. It will take him a day to discover the information, which he will be so eager to deliver to the party that he'll rush to meet them at dawn wherever they're staying. He will say, tearfully, that he recalled a story Tevor once told him, and he just needed to look up references in the ancient records to be sure. Havel will tell the party that the entrance to {@i the Borealus'} resting place is in the Scorched Grove, near a frog-shaped rock in the south.": "{@b {@i If Tevor is dead,}} 哈维尔会承认他不知道任何可能暗示北极光位置的线索，但他可以在守护者总部的档案中查阅一些相当古老的知识。如果给他时间解开这个谜团，哈维尔可能会找到一些有用的信息。他需要一天的时间来发现这些信息，他会迫不及待地想把这些信息交给队伍，以至于他会在黎明时分冲去他们所住的地方与他们见面。他会含泪地说，他想起了特沃尔曾经告诉过他的一个故事，他只是需要在古老的记录中查找参考资料来确认。哈维尔会告诉队伍，{@i the Borealus'} 的入口位于焦土林，在南部一个青蛙形状的岩石附近。",
	"Odwald will ask to accompany the party into the Scorched Grove, but he'll point out that due to his magical restraints he won't be of use to them in a fight. Should any party members try to get crafty and break Odwald out of the silver bangles, a close examination will reveal that the restraints cannot be dispelled or removed through conventional means, and appear to be made of a virtually indestructible material. If another reason to prevent Odwald from fighting by the party's side is required, he can also point out that should he die, the knowledge of the ritual which might save the Wood dies with him.": "奥德沃德(Odwald)会请求加入队伍进入焦土林(Silver Grove)，但他会指出，由于他的魔法约束，他在战斗中对他们没有帮助。如果有队员试图聪明地解开奥德沃德身上的银镯，仔细检查会发现这些约束不能通过常规手段解除或移除，并且似乎是由一种几乎不可摧毁的材料制成。如果需要另一个理由阻止奥德沃德与队伍一起战斗，他还可以指出，如果他死了，可能拯救森林的仪式知识也会随之消失。",
	"While he'll do his best to stay out of combat, Odwald can offer valuable insights. The party makes Intelligence checks with advantage while Odwald is with them. Should the heroes decide to journey without him, Odwald will stay in Alderheart under Perch Guard supervision, and await the party's return.": "尽管奥德瓦尔德(Odwald)会尽力避免参与战斗，但他可以提供宝贵的见解。当奥德瓦尔德(Odwald)与他们同行时，该小队进行智力检定时会获得优势。如果英雄们决定在没有他的情况下出发，奥德瓦尔德(Odwald)将留在奥尔德哈特(Alderheart)接受栖木卫兵(Perch Guard)的监督，并等待小队的返回。",
	"It's also possible that the party could bring Riffin along for this journey. Be sure to adjust encounters appropriately if this is the case.": "如果派对决定带上瑞芬（Riffin）一起旅行，也是有可能的。如果是这种情况，请确保适当调整遭遇。",
	"The party can reach the Grove in a day's travel if they don't mind hiking through the more dangerous parts of the Wood. Much of the Wood is covered in ash, and the energies of the Grove have spread in such a way that small patches of the nearby forested areas have become home to creatures and phenomena previously only witnessed in the Grove. For a more action-filled trip, roll on the {@table Appendix E: Random Encounters; Scorched Grove Encounters (Level 3)|HWCS|Scorched Grove Encounters} table. Optionally, skip right to the next section to increase the pace of the game.": "如果派对不介意穿越更危险的森林部分，他们可以在一天的旅行中到达林地。大部分森林被灰烬覆盖，林地的能量扩散到附近森林区域的小片区域，使得那里成为之前只在林地中见过的生物和现象的家园。要进行更加充满动作的旅行，请在{@table Appendix E: Random Encounters; Scorched Grove Encounters (Level 3)|HWCS|Scorched Grove Encounters}表上投掷骰子。可选择直接跳到下一部分以加快游戏节奏。",
	"In stark contrast to their last trip through the Scorched Grove, the party will find the ashen plain to be eerily silent and devoid of life, even the strange variety that usually finds purchase here. This is due to the increasing influence of the aspect of fire, which has caused the creatures here to scatter. It is much hotter and drier than it was before; have characters make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw once as part of traveling through the Grove, taking a level of {@condition exhaustion} from the heat on a failure.": "与他们上次穿过烧焦树林的情况截然不同，队伍会发现这片灰烬平原异常地寂静，毫无生机，甚至是通常在这里扎根的奇特生物也不见踪影。这是因为火焰之力的影响日益增强，导致这里的生物四处逃散。比以往更加炎热和干燥；让角色在穿越树林时进行一次 DC 12 的体质豁免检定，失败则受到 {@condition exhaustion} 等级的热浪影响。",
	"In order to contain the tremendous ice-aspected energies of {@i the Borealus}, the Tenders created a dungeon hidden beneath ash, and several magical defenses to keep the artifact out of mortal hands. The Elder Tenders of old needed to store the staff where the fire-aspected energies of the Scorched Grove could serve to keep {@i the Borealus'} dangerous energies sequestered. In times long past, Tenders wishing to join the leadership of their organization would come here to be tested for their worthiness; this practice was ended when a breach of the sanctum caused the Tenders to swear the location of {@i the Borealus} to secrecy and destroy records of its location. Only scant myths and snippets of information escaped the culling. Eventually, the last of those who possessed actual knowledge of the artifact died, and the dungeon has sat unused for hundreds of years.": "为了封印{@i the Borealus}所蕴含的巨大冰属性能量，守护者们在灰烬之下创建了一个地下城，并设置了几个魔法防御措施，以防止这件神器落入凡人之手。古老的长老守护者们需要将法杖存放在这里，让灼热林地的火属性能量帮助封印{@i the Borealus'}危险的能量。在很久以前，希望加入组织领导层的守护者会来这里接受考验以证明自己的价值；但当圣所遭到破坏时，守护者们发誓要将{@i the Borealus}的位置保密，并销毁有关其位置的记录，这一做法就此终结。只有少量神话和信息片段幸存下来。最终，那些真正了解这件神器的人全部逝去，这个地下城已经闲置了数百年。",
	"{@i The Borealus} lies at the lowest level of the dungeon, where the flame energies are strongest. It is safeguarded by an ancient treant called {@creature Oakheart|HWCS}. He is a sworn guardian, who was given instructions to only allow {@i the Borealus} to pass into the hands of one who understands and is committed to keeping nature's balance.": "{@i The Borealus}位于地牢的最底层，那里火焰能量最强。它受到一位名为(Trant)的古老树人的保护。他是一位守护者，被赋予指令，只允许{@i the Borealus}通过，交到一个理解并致力于保持自然平衡的人手中。",
	"The party should arrive at the frog-shaped rock after a few hours of travel through the Grove, but they need to figure out how to locate the dungeon's entrance.

The receptacles are large enough to fit the sprig of skyleaf. The fourth pedestal to the north is broken in half and exhibits obvious wear, as though it had been smashed long ago. The pedestal in the center of the disk has no domed receptacle or motif carved, only an inscribed Druidic rhyme.

	"The motifs carved into the three intact pedestals represent elemental forces of nature. The one to the west has motifs of waves and rain clouds, the one to the east has gusting winds and blowing leaves, and the one to the south has flames and smoke plumes. Upon closer examination, the broken pedestal has worn geometric motifs, depicting fallen trees on fractured ground, most likely representing earth. At least one party member must stand in the middle of these pedestals when placing the skyleaf sprig into a receptacle. Whether or not the party chooses the correct answer, nothing will happen if no one is standing in the center of the \"compass\" when placing the sprig inside a receptacle.": "这三座完好的基座上雕刻的图案代表着自然的元素力量。西边的基座上有波浪和雨云的图案，东边的基座上有狂风和飘落的树叶的图案，南边的基座上有火焰和烟雾的图案。仔细观察，破损的基座上有磨损的几何图案，描绘了倒下的树木和破碎的地面，很可能代表着土地。至少一名队伍成员必须站在这些基座的中间，才能将天叶芽放入容器中。无论队伍选择了正确的答案与否，在没有人站在“指南针”中心时，将叶芽放入容器中都不会发生任何事情。",

There is no light source down here, and players without {@sense darkvision} will need to provide illumination for themselves.": "楼梯向地牢深处延伸约150英尺，时而转折弯曲，直到通往一个带有圆形入口的圆形大厅。这里没有光源，没有{@sense darkvision}的玩家需要为自己提供照明。",
	"You see a chamber that appears to have been shaped out of black, volcanic rock. There is a wooden disk in the center of this chamber that has a series of druidic runes carved into its surface. In one quadrant of the disk these runes glow dimly with red light. Four alcoves surround this central room, equidistant from each other. In three of them, large statues of eagles, made from the same volcanic rock, rest upon intricately shaped branches of small, petrified trees. The fourth alcove is empty.": "你看到一个似乎是由黑色火山岩雕刻而成的房间。在这个房间的中央有一个木制圆盘，其表面雕刻着一系列德鲁伊符文。在圆盘的一个象限，这些符文微弱地发出红光。四个凹室环绕着这个中央房间，彼此等距分布。在其中三个凹室中，用同样的火山岩制成的大鹰雕像休息在由小石化树枝精心塑造的支架上。第四个凹室是空的。",
	"This chamber is 60 feet across, and each alcove is 10 feet across. The wooden disk in the center of the room is immune to fire damage, as are the petrified trees upon which the statues rest. As soon as the entire party enters the room, a stone slab closes over circular entryway, trapping the party inside. Each statue comes alight as the rock from which it is composed turns to barely-cooled magma. The 3 statues are Medium creatures that use the stat block for {@creature gargoyle|mm|gargoyles}, with the following changes:": "这个房间直径60英尺，每个凹室直径10英尺。房间中央的木盘对火焰伤害免疫，像石化的树木一样，承托雕像的石头也免疫火焰伤害。当整个队伍进入房间时，一个石板会关闭圆形入口，将队伍困在里面。每座雕像都会点燃，由其组成的岩石变成了刚刚冷却的岩浆。这3座雕像是中型生物，使用{@creature gargoyle|mm|gargoyles}的属性块，但有以下变化：",
	"They speak Ignan instead of Terran.": "他们说的是伊格南语(Ignan)，而不是泰兰语(Terran)。",
	"They are resistant to fire damage, but nothing else.": "他们对火焰伤害有抵抗力，但对其他伤害没有任何抵抗力。",
	"They attack with their claws and their beaks, which use the same stats for the claw and bite attacks of the gargoyles. These attacks deal fire damage instead of slashing or piercing damage.": "它们用它们的爪子和喙进行攻击，使用石像鬼的爪击和咬击攻击的相同属性。这些攻击造成火焰伤害，而不是割伤或穿刺伤害。",
	"When an eagle statue is defeated it transforms into red flames, which are drawn toward the druidic runes on the wooden disk in the room's center. This will cause a section of the central platform's runes to glow red. Once the statues have been defeated, all of the runes will be lit, and the platform can be used to travel between this room and the dungeon's lower level. Stepping onto the activated platform, a character will learn that the code words \"ascend\" and \"descend\" can be spoken anywhere in this dungeon to cause this platform to magically float down to the lower levels, or rise back up to this chamber.": "当一尊鹰雕像被打败时，它会变成红色火焰，被吸引到房间中央木盘上的德鲁伊符文上。这将导致中央平台的一部分符文发出红光。一旦雕像被打败，所有符文都会被点亮，平台就可以用来在这个房间和地牢下层之间旅行。踏上激活的平台，角色会得知代码词“升”和“降”可以在这个地牢的任何地方说出，使这个平台在下层魔法漂浮，或者上升回到这个房间。",
	"Speaking the word \"descend,\" the platform moves down a 50-foot shaft, which opens into a wide subterranean cavern, and lands in a disk-shaped depression on an island.": "当说出“下降”这个词时，平台沿着一个50英尺深的竖井向下移动，进入一个宽阔的地下洞穴，最终降落在一个岛上的圆盘形凹陷处。",
	"This large subterranean cavern is lit by the glow of magma, which flows below an island of rock. A long bridge connects the island to a bank on the other side, where a passageway continues through the cavern wall. It is sweltering in here.": "这个巨大的地下洞穴被岩浆的光芒照亮，岩浆在一个岩石岛下流动。一座长桥连接着岛屿和另一边的岸边，那里有一条通道穿过洞穴壁。这里非常闷热。",
	"The island is a mere 30 feet wide, and the ceilings are 60 feet high. The magma lies 60 feet below the island of rock, and any character that gets too near the edges of the island will feel its full heat. The heat isn't enough to cause damage, but any creature that falls into the magma will almost certainly die, if they're not immune to fire damage, taking 33 ({@dice 6d10}) points of fire damage each time they enter magma for the first time on a turn, or end their turn there. Fortunately, under normal circumstances there are no dangers within this place that would cause a character to fall into the magma. Add such hazards if desired, but consider the risks carefully.": "这个岛仅有30英尺宽，天花板高60英尺。岩石下方有60英尺深的岩浆，任何靠近岛屿边缘的角色都会感受到它的高温。这种热量不足以造成伤害，但任何掉入岩浆中的生物几乎肯定会死亡，除非它们对火焰伤害免疫，在每个回合第一次进入岩浆或在那里结束回合时，会受到33 ({@dice 6d10}) 点火焰伤害。幸运的是，在正常情况下，这个地方内部没有危险会导致角色掉入岩浆中。如果需要，可以添加这样的危险，但请仔细考虑风险。",
	"The bridge over the magma is 10 feet wide and 20 feet long. It appears to have small gaps at 5-foot intervals. Any player who steps onto the bridge's surface will trigger the bridge's main trap, which will cause a 20-foot-high jet of flame to erupt from the nearest gap. This jet remains for a few seconds, receding for a moment before flaring up again.": "这座横跨岩浆的桥宽10英尺，长20英尺。它似乎在每5英尺的间隔处有小缝隙。任何踏上桥面的玩家都会触发桥的主陷阱，导致最近的缝隙喷出一股高20英尺的火焰喷射。这股火焰会持续几秒钟，稍作停顿后再次喷发。",
	"Characters who hesitate once they begin crossing will find their energy sapped, as they are caught between the hot jets. It is impossible for a character to run across the bridge avoiding these jets, unless they succeed on the listed {@skill Acrobatics} check for every jet they cross.": "一旦开始过桥的角色犹豫不决，就会发现他们的能量被耗尽，因为他们被热气流困住了。除非角色在过桥时成功通过每个热气流的列出检定{@skill Acrobatics}，否则不可能避开这些热气流。",
	"There are a few ways to circumvent this obstacle:": "有几种方法可以规避这个障碍：",
	"Players might have access to the {@spell fly} spell, which can be used to avoid the bridge altogether.": "玩家可能会获得{@spell fly}法术的使用权限，可以用来完全避开桥梁。",
	"Players with resistance to fire may be able to make it across even if they cannot succeed on their checks, especially if they have the ability to heal themselves.": "即使不能在检定中取得成功，具有火焰抗性的玩家可能仍然能够通过，特别是如果他们有自愈能力。",
	"Players can attempt to block the jets of flame, though the jets erupt with enough force to blast through wooden barriers. If a metal object (like a shield) is held in place to allow passage across a jet, it will be rendered red hot, causing 9 ({@dice 2d8}) points of fire damage to anyone holding or stepping onto the object.": "玩家可以尝试阻挡火焰喷射，尽管火焰喷射具有足够的力量穿透木制障碍物。如果金属物体（如盾牌）被固定在原地以允许穿越火焰喷射，它将被加热至通红，并对任何持有或踩在上面的人造成9（{@dice 2d8}）点火焰伤害。",
	"The {@spell Tenser's floating disk} spell will completely block the flame jets, and its magic will shield anyone on top of the disk from the heat of the jets, allowing for easy passage.": "{@spell Tenser's floating disk}法术将完全阻挡火焰喷射，其魔法将保护站在飞盘上的任何人免受火焰热量的影响，从而方便通过。",
	"Use the above rules to decide whether any of the more unique solutions players could conceive of will work.": "根据上述规则来决定玩家可能构想的更独特解决方案是否有效。",
	"The passageway from the magma chamber continues for another 400 feet, curving downwards until it leads into a strange space.": "从岩浆室延伸出来的通道还有400英尺，向下弯曲，直到通向一个奇怪的空间。",
	"The tunnel transitions into a room that has been magically shaped from the earth beneath the Grove. The floor is made of black cobblestones, shaped from a layer of volcanic rock. Breaking through the stones is a line of three great trees. Each tree appears black and charred, with leaves of flame and bark that glows like embers. The tree in the middle is the largest, and its roots tangle outward in a great mass.": "隧道过渡到一个被魔法塑造的房间，这个房间是从Grove下面的土地塑造而成的。地板由黑色鹅卵石制成，是由一层火山岩形成的。穿过石头的是一排三棵巨大的树。每棵树看起来都是黑色和烧焦的，叶子如火焰，树皮闪烁着像热炭一样的光芒。中间的那棵树是最大的，它的根向外纠缠成一团巨大的根系。",
	"The room is 90 feet long and 60 feet wide. The largest tree is {@creature Oakheart|HWCS}. Once enough of the party has made it within 80 feet of the trees, Oakheart will reveal himself, shuddering as if waking from a deep slumber. His body shifts into a more humanoid form. Oakheart speaks slowly in Birdfolk, or in Druidic if one of the party members is a druid, with a voice that sounds like a cross between creaking wood and a blasting forge.": "房间长90英尺，宽60英尺。最大的树是{@creature Oakheart|HWCS}。一旦足够多的队伍成员靠近树木80英尺，橡心(Oakheart)将显露自己，仿佛从沉睡中醒来一般颤抖。他的身体转变成更类似人形的形态。橡心用鸟人语或者如果队伍中有德鲁伊，则用德鲁伊语缓慢地说话，声音听起来像是木头嘎吱作响和熔炉爆炸声的交叉。",
	"Suddenly, the great tree at the back of the room quivers, and its bark shifts to reveal eyes and a mouth. Its long branches twist into hands and its roots become large feet. \"Hrrmmmmmm... so... I am to receive... guests? How long has it been?\" the creature creaks. \"You do not look... like Tenders... a test is in order then...\"": "突然，房间后面的巨树颤抖起来，树皮移开露出眼睛和嘴巴。它的长枝条扭曲成手，根部变成了大脚。“嗯......所以......我要接待......客人？多久了？”生物吱吱作响。“你们看起来不像......守护者......那么就需要一场考验......”",
	"Oakheart will then fight the party to test whether or not they possess the skill needed to safely control {@i the Borealus}. If the above dialog was interrupted by a player launching an attack at any point, do not treat Oakheart as being surprised and simply roll initiative as normal. Oakheart is sworn to guard {@i the Borealus} from thieves, and if attacked while speaking he'll scold the players on his turn, saying:": "橡心将与队伍战斗，以测试他们是否具备安全控制{@i the Borealus}所需的技能。如果上述对话被玩家的突然攻击打断，不要认为橡心感到惊讶，只需按照正常情况进行先攻检定。橡心宣誓要保护{@i the Borealus}免受小偷侵害，如果在讲话时遭受攻击，他会在自己的回合责备玩家，说道：",
	"\"Little ones... so impatient...\"": "\"小家伙们...太急躁了...\"",
	"If the party attempts to talk their way out of this fight, he will say:": "如果队伍试图通过交谈来避免这场战斗，他会说：",
	"\"It matters not... None may obtain {@i the Borealus}... until they have proven... their worth!\" ": "\"这并不重要... 在他们证明了自己的价值之前... 没有人能获得{@i the Borealus}!\"",
	"Oakheart will begin by animating the other two charred trees in the room. They have stats identical to Oakheart, but otherwise follow the rules for animated trees in the {@creature treant} stat block.": "Oakheart (橡心) 将开始激活房间里的另外两棵烧焦树木。它们的属性与橡心相同，但在其他方面遵循{@creature treant}状态块中的动态树规则。",
	"Oakheart will not die once he reaches 0 hit points, but he will cease his assault and return the trees he animated to their posts. He is a guardian, but unless the party shows or has shown signs of ill intent throughout the dungeon, he will sense that they are not thieves and try not to kill them. He simply wishes to test whether or not they are strong enough to control the terrible power of {@i the Borealus}.": "Oakheart（橡木之心）在达到0点生命值时不会死亡，但他会停止攻击，并让他激活的树木返回原位。他是守护者，但除非队伍在地牢中表现出或曾表现出恶意，否则他会感知到他们不是小偷，并尽量不去杀死他们。他只是想测试他们是否足够强大来控制{@i the Borealus}这种可怕力量。",
	"If the party does poorly in this fight, Oakheart may cease his assault and dismiss his animated trees, sitting down to parley. He'll ask why they have risked their lives to obtain {@i the Borealus}. If Oakheart is satisfied with the answer (attempting to save the Wood from burning is an acceptable explanation), he will give them the staff.": "如果队伍在这场战斗中表现不佳，橡心可能会停止进攻，解散他的活木树，坐下来进行和谈。他会问他们为什么冒着生命危险要获得{@i the Borealus}。如果橡心对答案满意（试图拯救木之光免于燃烧是可以接受的解释），他会给他们这根法杖。",
	"Whether defeated in battle or convinced to give the players {@i the Borealus}, Oakheart will inform the party that he has safe-guarded the artifact with his own life force, and for its power to become unsealed his life must end. There's no way around this. If characters sympathize, he will thank them for their concerns, and offer a warm smile before delivering the parting statement:": "无论是在战斗中被击败还是被说服交出给玩家{@i the Borealus}，橡心(Oakheart)都会告知队伍，他已经用自己的生命力保护了这件神器，只有在他的生命结束时，它的力量才会被解封。这是无法避免的。如果角色们表示同情，他会感谢他们的关心，并在道别时微笑着说：",
	"\"I have lived for a very... very... very long time. I go... with the blessing of the Nightfather... that I may pass onto you... this burden.\" Oakheart then reaches into a hollow in his trunk, and pulls out a luminous crystal staff. \"Plant this one in flames... such is its power... otherwise... the Wood may freeze...\"": "\"我已经活了很...很...很长时间了。我带着夜父的祝福...希望能将这个负担传给你。\" 橡心然后伸手进他的树干空洞，拿出一根发光的水晶法杖。\"将这个种在火焰中...它的力量如此强大...否则...森林可能会冻结...\"",
	"As Oakheart speaks the light from his bark dims, and his flame-leaves fade, leaving behind a large blackened tree amidst the chamber.": "当橡木之心说话时，他身上的光芒渐渐暗淡，他的火焰叶子也凋零了，只留下一棵巨大的烧焦树在房间中央。",
	"The party receives the artifact they came here for: {@item Borealus|HWCS|the Borealus}.": "队伍获得了他们来这里寻找的神器：{@item Borealus|HWCS|the Borealus}。",
	"Once the party has acquired {@i the Borealus}, have them return to Alderheart.": "一旦队伍获得了{@i the Borealus}，让他们返回到艾尔德哈特（Alderheart）。",
	"Upon returning to Alderheart, give the party a chance to have a long rest and recover from any exhaustion they may have suffered traveling through the Grove. After resting, they will find Dean Windsworth waiting for them in the common room of the inn in which they are staying. He has been called on by the Council to advise the Defenders of Alderheart during these perilous times. The Dean will be stupefied by the existence of {@i the Borealus}, and overjoyed that the party has obtained it. This means there is a chance to stop the aspect and save the Wood.": "当返回到奥德哈特时，给予队伍一个机会进行长时间休息，从穿越格罗夫时可能遭受的任何疲惫中恢复过来。休息后，他们会发现迪恩·温兹沃斯（Dean Windsworth）正在他们所住的客栈的客厅里等待着他们。他被议会召见，以在这危险时期为奥德哈特的守护者提供建议。迪恩会对{@i the Borealus}的存在感到惊讶，并为队伍已经获得它而感到欣喜。这意味着有机会阻止这个面相，拯救这片森林。",
	"If Odwald is with the party, he will explain that the aspect must still be weakened in order for {@i the Borealus} to be useful in sealing it. What's more, in order to channel a power as vast as {@i the Borealus} is said to contain, the ritual requires at least two mages working in tandem to succeed. This ritual must be done over the conjuration circle that was used to seal the aspect the first time. Fortunately for them, Odwald knows its location. If Odwald died, the Dean will take over Odwald's role in explaining the information gleaned from the necromancer's ritual notes.": "如果奥德瓦尔德（Odwald）与队伍同行，他会解释必须仍然削弱该属性，以便使{@i the Borealus}在封印中发挥作用。此外，为了引导像{@i the Borealus}所包含的如此巨大的力量，仪式需要至少两名法师共同合作才能成功。这个仪式必须在第一次用来封印属性的召唤圈上进行。幸运的是，奥德瓦尔德知道它的位置。如果奥德瓦尔德死了，院长（the Dean）将接替奥德瓦尔德的角色，解释从死灵法师的仪式笔记中获得的信息。",
	"After learning about the ritual, the party will notice a commotion outside the inn. Some people are closing up their shops, others appear to be filing to the city gates with hastily packed bags, some with families in tow, and others still are heading toward the canopy. The party will soon learn the cause, either by asking passersby or listening to town criers, who announce an emergency meeting of all citizenry. The party can investigate, but it won't be long before they receive a summons from the Council. The news is grim: the aspect is moving toward the Great Tree City.": "在了解了仪式之后，队伍会注意到客栈外面有一片骚动。一些人正在关店，另一些人看起来正在带着匆忙打包的行李向城门走去，还有一些人带着家人，而另一些人则朝着树荫走去。队伍很快会得知原因，可以通过询问路人或倾听城镇传声筒来了解，后者宣布全体市民紧急会议。队伍可以进行调查，但很快他们会收到理事会的传唤。消息很严峻：(Great Tree City)正在朝着这里移动。",
	"Everyone is crowded around the Council Chambers, some literally hanging from branches and filling up every inch of available space. In this sea of faces, the party will see any currently living friendly NPC they might have encountered on their journey who would reasonably be in Alderheart at this time, including: the Dean, Benna, Riffin, Susan, Odwald, Havel, Tevor, Eliza, and the jerbeen orphans.": "每个人都挤在议会大厅周围，有些人甚至从树枝上悬挂，填满了每一寸可用空间。在这一片人海中，队伍会看到他们在旅途中可能遇到过的任何目前仍然存活且有理由在此时在奥尔德哈特的友好NPC，包括：院长、贝娜、里弗恩、苏珊、奥德瓦尔德、哈维尔、特沃尔、伊莉莎和杰比恩孤儿们。",
	"The citizens are nervous and whispering amongst themselves. Some say they saw an intense red-orange glow far off in the forest, others that Alderheart is under attack, and some are worried the Council will call for an evacuation.": "市民们很紧张，彼此窃窃私语。有些人说他们看到了森林深处的一团橙红色的强烈光芒，还有人说奥尔德哈特(Alderheart)正在遭受攻击，还有一些人担心议会会下令疏散。",
	"A contingent of The Spears escorts the members of the Council (including, if appropriate, any newly-elected humblefolk delegates) onto a specially prepared platform with a row of seats and a podium that bears Alderheart's city crest. {@creature Bita, the Council Speaker|HWCS} appears from out of the ranks of the Council members as they take their seats. A hush falls over the crowd when she approaches the podium:": "一支(`The Spears`)的队伍护送(`escorts`)议会成员（包括任何新选举产生的(`newly-elected`)平民代表）登上一个特别准备好的平台，上面有一排座位和一个印有(`Alderheart`)城市纹章的讲台。当他们就座时，{@creature Bita, the Council Speaker|HWCS} 从议会成员的队伍中走出来。当她走向讲台时，人群突然静了下来：",
	"\"My fellow citizens, we have just received a dire report from our watchposts. The elemental creature that so recently arose from beneath our Wood now makes its way toward Alderheart.\"": "\"吾等同胞们，我们刚刚收到了来自我们哨所的紧急报告。那个最近从我们的木林下升起的元素生物现在正朝着艾尔德哈特（Alderheart）前进。\"",
	"The citizens may remain silent, or begin to despair. They might even start to panic, at which point the Defenders of Alderheart may step in to help regain control. As symbols of hope in the realm, the crowd will listen to them. Any party member can step up to make a reassuring statement and attempt a DC 16 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check to calm the populace, allowing Speaker Bita to continue. Have a character roll this check with advantage if their reputation has earned them particular favor among the many Alderites (if they are seen as a champion of the people, for example).": "市民们可能保持沉默，或开始绝望。他们甚至可能开始恐慌，此时阿尔德哈特的守护者可能会介入帮助恢复控制。作为王国希望的象征，人群会倾听他们的话。任何一名队伍成员都可以站出来发表安抚性的声明，并尝试进行一次 DC 16 魅力检定 ({@skill Persuasion}) 来平息民众，让发言人碧塔继续发言。如果他们的声望在众多阿尔德人中赢得了特别的青睐（例如被视为人民的英雄），让一名角色进行此检定时获得优势投掷。",
	"Speaker Bita gives the crowd a moment, thanking the Defenders of Alderheart if they provided assistance, then resumes, speaking with a grace and dignity that inspires hope even in these dark times:": "Bita发言者给了人群一会儿时间，感谢如果他们提供了帮助的阿尔德之心守护者，然后继续讲话，以一种优雅和尊严的方式，即使在这些黑暗时期也能激发希望：",
	"\"Recently, we have faced many hardships. The flames that ravaged the Wood have threatened to tear our communities apart. Yet, Alderheart still stands. We are not birdfolk and humblefolk, nor are we perch-dwellers and forest-dwellers: we are people of Humblewood. Since its creation, Alderheart was meant to stand as a symbol of our unity. Perhaps we have lost our way since those early days, but there is still a chance for a brighter future. However, in order to obtain it we must stand together now! I implore each and every citizen of Humblewood, not as the Council Speaker, but as a fellow resident of the Wood. We must defend each other, we must defend Humblewood. It is the only home we have.\"": "\"最近，我们面临了许多困难。肆虐森林的烈焰威胁着撕裂我们的社区。然而，阿尔德之心仍然屹立不倒。我们不是鸟人和谦卑之民，也不是栖息者和森林居民：我们是谦卑森林的人民。自从它的建立，阿尔德之心就被视为我们团结的象征。也许自从那些早期的日子以来，我们已经迷失了方向，但仍然有机会迎接更美好的未来。然而，为了实现这一目标，我们现在必须团结起来！我恳请每一位谦卑森林的公民，不是作为议会发言人，而是作为森林的一名居民。我们必须彼此捍卫，我们必须捍卫谦卑森林。这是我们唯一的家园。\"",
	"Someone starts cheering. Whoever starts the cheer is optional: it may be a humblefolk (perhaps one of the jerbeen orphans, or a reformed bandit working for the Wildwood Brigade), or a birdfolk (maybe Tevor, showing his newfound courage, or Riffin, to inspire the people). This one cry will multiply, and soon the crowd cheers together with one voice, as denizens from all parts of Humblewood unite.": "有人开始欢呼。开始欢呼的人是可选的：可以是一个谦卑族（也许是杰比恩孤儿之一，或者是一个为荒野旅团工作的改邪归正的强盗），或者是一个鸟族（也许是特沃（Tevor），展现他新获得的勇气，或者是瑞芬（Riffin），激励人们）。这一声呼喊会传播开来，很快，人群会齐声欢呼，作为谦卑林各地居民团结一致的表现。",
	"After Speaker Bita's speech, the party will be found by either Odwald or the Dean (if Odwald isn't alive) and told that, by the looks of it, the aspect's influence in this region has grown tenfold since the party's first encounter. If they don't take the opportunity to try and seal the aspect with {@i the Borealus} now, even if it is driven back, the aspect may become too strong to attempt sealing again.": "在Bita发言之后，派对将会被奥德瓦尔德或者院长（如果奥德瓦尔德已经死亡）找到，并告知，从情况来看，自派对首次遭遇以来，该力量在这个地区的影响力增长了十倍。如果他们不趁现在尝试用{@i the Borealus}封印这个力量，即使它被击退，这个力量可能会变得太强大，无法再次尝试封印。",
	"The Defenders of Alderheart will soon find their presence requested by the Council: the aspect of fire must be stopped before it reaches the Great Tree City. Its movement has stirred up ashsnakes, emberbats, and other fire creatures that are causing havoc in the surrounding forest. Give the party a chance to explain to the Council what they can do to help (the Council is receptive to most ideas), but if the party doesn't mention sealing away the aspect, then either Odwald or the Dean (if Odwald is dead) will make the suggestion.": "当奥德哈特的守护者们很快会收到议会的邀请：火之本质必须在抵达大树之城之前被阻止。它的移动已经激起了火蛇、燃烧蝙蝠和其他引发周围森林混乱的火元素生物。给予队伍机会向议会解释他们可以如何帮助（议会对大多数想法持开放态度），但如果队伍没有提到封印火之本质，那么奥德瓦尔德或者院长（如果奥德瓦尔德已经死亡）会提出这个建议。",
	"While the Council will listen to the Dean, Odwald will be looked upon more suspiciously, and the party may need to convince the members on his behalf. To keep the tension high maybe have the party roll Charisma checks for this. The Council will trust the Defenders of Alderheart, even if they don't trust Odwald. However the Council is convinced, Speaker Bita will make it clear in no uncertain terms that the fate of the Wood is in the party's hands.": "在听取院长的意见后，奥德瓦尔德会受到更多怀疑的目光，派对可能需要说服成员们支持他。为了保持紧张气氛，也许可以让派对进行魅力检定。议会会相信阿尔德哈特的守护者，即使他们不信任奥德瓦尔德。无论议会如何被说服，发言人碧塔会明确表示木之命运掌握在派对手中。",
	"Odwald will elaborate that in order to complete the ritual to seal the aspect, two mages must work together to weave a spell into the existing conjuration circle to strengthen and alter its magic. He'll also remind the party of the importance of utilizing cold-type magics to subdue the aspect. Once it has been subdued, they will have only an hour before it regenerates, so it's imperative that the character attuned to {@i the Borealus} brings it to the circle, so the mages can complete the sealing.": "奥德瓦尔德将详细说明，为了完成封印力量的仪式，两名法师必须共同合作，将一个咒语编织到现有的召唤阵中，以增强和改变其魔法。他还会提醒队伍利用冰属性魔法来制服这个力量的重要性。一旦它被制服，他们只有一个小时的时间才能再生，所以非常重要的是，那位与{@i the Borealus}共鸣的角色将其带到阵中，这样法师们才能完成封印。",
	"If a spellcasting party member volunteers to help the NPCs prepare the sealing ritual, they will be turned down. Preparing the ritual will be time-consuming and require such focus that the party member wouldn't be able to fight the aspect at the same time. The mages who work the ritual need to rely on the Defenders of Alderheart to ensure their efforts aren't interrupted. Odwald (or the Dean, if Odwald is dead) will explain that the second mage must have a good grasp of arcane theory and precise control over their magic. They will essentially serve as an additional power source and they therefore do not need to have the same familiarity with the ritual.": "如果一个施法的队员自愿帮助NPC们准备封印仪式，他们会被拒绝。准备仪式将耗费大量时间，并需要如此专注，以至于该队员无法同时与那个方面作战。进行仪式的法师们需要依靠奥德瓦尔（或者如果奥德瓦尔已经死了，那就是院长）确保他们的努力不会被打断。奥德瓦尔（或者院长，如果奥德瓦尔已经死了）会解释第二位法师必须对奥术理论有很好的掌握，并对自己的魔法有精确的控制。他们基本上将作为一个额外的能量来源，因此不需要对仪式有相同的熟悉度。",
	"Odwald can think of only one other spellcaster he would trust with this ritual: Susan, and he will ask for her to accompany him (if she is alive). Otherwise, the Dean can help. The Dean has a strong desire to see this through to the end, and would gladly work with Odwald for the good of the Wood. If Odwald is dead, the Dean will need assistance for the ritual. Should Susan not be able to assist, a Council member will mention knowing of a talented spellcasting protégé within the Tenders who may be able to help. This is, of course, Havel.": "Odwald只能想到另外一个他愿意信任的法师来进行这个仪式：苏珊，他会请求她与他同行（如果她还活着的话）。否则，院长可以提供帮助。院长渴望见证这一切的结束，并愿意与Odwald为了森林的利益而共同努力。如果Odwald已经死了，院长将需要仪式的帮助。如果苏珊无法提供帮助，一位议会成员会提到在Tenders内有一位有才华的法术学徒可能能够提供帮助。当然，这就是哈维尔。",
	"If Odwald is conducting the ritual he will request to have the restraints inhibiting his magic removed, which will cause the Council consternation, but they will ultimately agree.": "如果奥德瓦尔德（Odwald）正在进行仪式，他会要求解除限制他魔法的约束，这会让议会感到困惑，但他们最终会同意。",
	"If the party is still suspicious of Odwald's intentions and unwilling to have his restraints removed, the Dean (who has been looking through Odwald's notes) is familiar enough with the material to lead the ritual. Even so, he'll insist they bring Odwald along, shackled or not, as the corvum's knowledge could prove useful should something go awry.": "如果派对仍然怀疑奥德瓦尔德的意图，并不愿意解除他的限制，院长（一直在查看奥德瓦尔德的笔记）对这些材料很熟悉，可以领导仪式。即便如此，他会坚持让他们带上奥德瓦尔德，无论是否被铐着，因为乌鸦兽的知识在出现问题时可能会派上用场。",
	"The plan is to have the mages escorted to the conjuration circle, by either the Wildwood Brigade or the Perch Guard, to prepare the ritual. The rest of the Perch Guard and/or Wildwood Brigade will need to work together to keep the path to the aspect cleared for the party.": "计划是让法师们由野林旅(Wildwood Brigade)或栖地卫士(Perch Guard)护送到幻术法阵，准备仪式。其余的栖地卫士和/或野林旅需要共同努力，保持通往元素之路畅通，以便让队伍通过。",
	"Whoever is leading the ritual indicates that someone will have to grab the aspect's attention and lure it closer to the Grove. If the aspect is too far away when the ritual is completed, there's no guarantee it will be sealed. Scouts report that the aspect is easy to provoke, but it'll be difficult to outpace, and luring it to the Grove will certainly place the volunteer in incredible danger. Riffin volunteers to help draw the aspect back to the circle if he's here, otherwise a Defender of Alderheart has to volunteer for the task. Speed won't matter as much as endurance, since they'll need to be able to withstand whatever the aspect can throw at them in order to make it to the Grove.": "领导仪式的人指出，必须有人吸引那个本质的注意力，将其引诱靠近林地。如果仪式完成时本质距离太远，就无法保证它会被封印。侦察员报告说，激怒本质很容易，但要甩开它却很困难，将其引诱到林地肯定会让志愿者陷入极大的危险中。如果里芬在场，他自愿帮忙将本质引回圈内，否则艾尔德之心的守护者必须自愿承担这个任务。速度不如耐力重要，因为他们需要能够承受本质可能对他们施加的一切，才能抵达林地。",

If they're looking for a little extra, {@adventure Eliza's Emporium|HWAitW|2|Eliza's Emporium} is always open, though even in such dire times the party won't be able to get a magic item for free.

	"Before the characters can do battle with the aspect of fire, they must find a way to lure it out of the forest toward the Scorched Grove. This is necessary not only for the ritual, but because the abundance of available fuel in the forest makes the aspect functionally invincible there. Consider having a scout report that the aspect seems to flare up as it burns through the forest, as players may be unaware that the aspect can heal itself using the trees it consumes. While not a vital clue at this stage, this information about the aspect is essential to the fight. If not given the hint, players will have to deduce why the aspect is not weakening when fought in wooded areas.": "在角色们能够与火之本质进行战斗之前，他们必须找到一种方法将其诱出森林，朝着焦枯林引导它。这不仅是为了仪式所需，还因为森林中丰富的燃料使得本质在那里几乎无敌。考虑让侦察员报告，本质似乎会在燃烧森林时变得更加猛烈，因为玩家可能不知道本质可以利用它所消耗的树木来自我治愈。虽然在这个阶段这不是一个至关重要的线索，但关于本质的这些信息对战斗至关重要。如果没有给出提示，玩家将不得不推断为什么在树木茂密的地区与本质战斗时它并没有虚弱下来。",

	"Harsher sentences for bandits and thieves are being called for by Alderheart's elite, and the news on the wind is that the Bandit Coalition is still around. Though broken, it survives to cause trouble for merchants who can't afford an escort.": "艾尔德哈特(Aldeheart)的精英们呼吁对土匪和小偷采取更严厉的惩罚，风传言说土匪联盟仍然存在。虽然支离破碎，但他们仍然存在，给那些无法负担护卫的商人制造麻烦。",
	"The Scorched Grove has shrunk in recent months, owing to the efforts of Tenders as much as the sealing of the aspect. While the Grove will remain part of Humblewood for the foreseeable future, the ash in its plains no longer burns with embers, reducing the frequency of fires in the Wood. The ashsnakes that appeared with the aspect remain, and have filled new niches in the ecology of the Grove, due to the snake's ability to survive on the energy of consumed elementals and beasts. The ashsnakes help keep some of the more dangerous fire-based creatures at bay. This has greatly helped the Tenders, who now see the ashsnakes as something to be respected from a distance, but not feared. Plants are growing on the lonely hill which marks the final resting place of the aspect of fire, and the sapling which sprouted from its top is quickly growing into a tree. It has been named \"The Healing Hill,\" and is watched over by the Tenders as a sacred site.": "在最近几个月里，由于守望者的努力以及元素的封印，焦痕林地已经缩小。虽然焦痕林地在可预见的将来仍将是谦卑森林的一部分，但平原上的灰烬不再燃烧着余烬，减少了森林火灾的频率。随着元素的出现，灰蛇依然存在，并在焦痕林地的生态系统中填补了新的生态位，这是因为灰蛇能够依靠消化元素和野兽的能量生存。灰蛇帮助阻挡了一些更危险的以火为基础的生物。这对守望者有很大帮助，他们现在将灰蛇视为一种需要尊重但不必恐惧的存在。在标志着火元素最终安息之地的孤独小山上长出了植物，从山顶发芽的幼苗迅速长成了一棵树。它被命名为“治愈之丘”，并被守望者视为一个神圣的场所。",
	"One night, a player's character, will have strange dreams. In the dreams, they encounter Odwald. His form is spectral and he appears to have something to say, but before he can impart any new wisdom, the character wakes up. Who was the entity that tricked him into releasing the aspect? If they could cause such destruction in Humblewood, what might happen to Everden if they're still out there?": "一晚，一名玩家的角色将会做奇怪的梦。在梦中，他们遇到了奥德瓦尔德(Odwald)。他的形态是幽灵般的，似乎有话要说，但在他能传授任何新智慧之前，角色就醒了。是哪个实体欺骗了他释放这个面相？如果他们能在汉布尔伍德(Humblewood)造成如此破坏，那么如果他们仍然存在，埃弗登(Everden)会发生什么？",
		"The terrain is difficult for the party, but not for Fray, who is familiar with the area. Any character trying to pursue Fray on foot will quickly lose her in the forest unless they can make a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check each round. The dense forest also makes gliding difficult. Most birdfolk can't glide through the trees, but Small birdfolk characters can attempt to glide after Fray, avoiding trunks and branches with a DC 15 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check.": "地形对队伍来说很困难，但对熟悉这个地区的Fray来说却不是问题。任何试图步行追赶Fray的角色，除非他们每轮都能通过一次DC 15的感知检定({@skill Perception})，否则很快就会在森林中迷失她。茂密的森林也使得滑翔变得困难。大多数飞禽族无法在树间滑翔，但小型飞禽族角色可以尝试在Fray之后滑翔，通过一次DC 15的敏捷检定({@skill Acrobatics})来避开树干和树枝。",
	"An agitated kindled corvum dressed in finery approaches you, his feathers ruffled with worry. \"Adventurers? Thank Clhuran you happened here! Please, you must help me. Kenna, that foolish girl, has gotten in over her head! She ventured to the caverns looking for slimes, but hasn't returned for days! I can only hope she's still alive—you will help me, won't you?\"": "一只穿着华丽服饰的焦躁的克鲁文乌鸦走向你，羽毛因担忧而蓬乱。“冒险者？感谢克鲁兰，你们来了！请，你们一定要帮帮我。那个愚蠢的女孩肯娜，已经陷入了麻烦！她冒险前往洞穴寻找史莱姆，但已经好几天没有回来了！我只能希望她还活着—你们会帮助我，对吧？”",
	"To speed up travel, a character can make a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check to navigate the swamp and find signs of the witch.": "为了加快旅行速度，角色可以进行一次DC 15的感知({@skill Survival})检定，来导航沼泽并找到女巫的迹象。",
	"One character must make a DC 11 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check to pass off a suitable lie to the Magistrate. If they produce the horn amulet as proof, the character making the check rolls with advantage. If they do not have the amulet, they must account for why they don't have it in order for Walden to accept their story and reward them.": "一个角色必须进行一次 DC 11 魅力检定({@skill Deception})，向大法官说出一个合适的谎言。如果他们出示了角笛护身符作为证据，那么进行检定时会获得优势。如果他们没有护身符，他们必须解释为什么没有它，以便沃尔登接受他们的故事并奖励他们。",
	"After their trials at Winnowing Reach, characters will continue to make their way toward Alderheart to seek an audience with the Birdfolk Council, possibly with Eliza in tow. The road to the capital is long, requiring three days of travel. Be sure to have Eliza or another NPC from Winnowing Reach remind the party to properly stock up before they depart. They can find any supplies they might need for their journey (rations, bedrolls, and the like) at the local general store.": "经过在（Winnowing Reach）的考验后，角色们将继续前往（Alderheart）寻求与（Birdfolk Council）会面的机会，可能会带上（Eliza）。通往首都的道路很长，需要三天的旅行时间。确保Eliza或Winnowing Reach的另一名NPC提醒队伍在启程前妥善准备。他们可以在当地的综合商店购买他们旅途中可能需要的任何物品（干粮、睡袋等）。",
	"If the party examines the outside of the trunk where Figory saw the creature, a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check will be enough to uncover marks on the trunk's surface, as well as a few pieces of bone peeking out of the soft earth.": "如果角色审查了树干外部，就会发现一些标记在树干表面，以及一些骨头露出软土。这需要一个DC 15的智力检定({@skill Investigation})。",
	"If anyone approaches Odwald, he will attempt to bluff that he is a humble traveler looking for work defending caravans in order to hone his skills. A character who sits down with Odwald must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to notice a hiccup in his illusion. The moment Odwald feels unsafe, he'll run.": "如果有人接近奥德瓦尔德，他会试图虚张声势，假装自己是一个谦逊的旅行者，正在寻找保护商队以磨练技能的工作。与奥德瓦尔德坐下的角色必须在感知检定中达到 DC 15 的感知 ({@skill Perception}) 检定，才能察觉到他幻觉中的破绽。一旦奥德瓦尔德感到不安全，他会逃跑。",
	"The party can tell that these flame jets aren't made of magma, but that they are still dangerous. Any character who passes through one will need to succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check to avoid taking damage. Failure on this check means the character must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, or take 10 ({@dice 3d6}) points of fire damage from the flames on a failure, or half as much on a success. Whether or not they succeed on this save, the characters will arrive on the other side of the jet, which will trigger the next flame jet.": "队伍可以看出这些火焰喷射口并非由岩浆构成，但它们仍然很危险。任何通过其中一个的角色都需要成功通过一次 DC 16 敏捷检定（{@skill Acrobatics}）来避免受到伤害。检定失败意味着角色必须进行一次 DC 17 敏捷豁免检定，否则会受到来自火焰的 10 点伤害（{@dice 3d6}），成功则减半。无论他们是否在这次豁免检定中成功，角色都会到达火焰喷射口的另一侧，触发下一个火焰喷射口。",
	"If a player decides to attack the aspect during this chase, resolve their attack as normal, but the aspect won't take any damage. The character should see that once the aspect moves through a stand of trees, its fire consumes the trees, causing it to regain health and blaze brightly.": "如果玩家决定在这场追逐中攻击(`aspect`)，则按照正常方式解决他们的攻击，但`aspect`不会受到任何伤害。角色应该看到，一旦`aspect`穿过一片树林，它的火焰吞噬了树木，使其恢复健康并熊熊燃烧。",
