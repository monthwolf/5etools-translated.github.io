	"This chapter presents a complete Acquisitions Incorporated adventure divided into six episodes. Episode 1 is for players using shiny new 1st-level characters. They're ready to take on the world and hoping to become part-owners of a share in a valuable, prestigious Acquisitions Incorporated franchise—or at least gain a coveted internship with the organization.": "本章介绍了一个完整的收购公司冒险，分为六集。第1集是为使用闪亮的新一级角色的玩家准备的。他们已经准备好向世界挑战，并希望成为有价值、有声望的收购公司特许经营权的部分拥有者--或者至少获得一个令人羡慕的组织实习机会。",
	"At the end of each episode, characters gain a level. Each episode is an appropriate challenge for a party of four characters of the indicated level, but that challenge can be modified to accommodate your group. At the end of the sixth and final episode, the characters attain 7th level. But even more importantly, they will be fully vested in an operational and maybe even profitable Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. After that, the players and characters can take their treasure-hunting activities in any direction that you and they desire.": "在每一集结束时，角色会获得一个等级。每一集都是对指定级别的四名角色的适当挑战，但该挑战可以修改以适应你的团体。在第六集也就是最后一集结束时，人物达到了第七级。但更重要的是，他们将完全拥有一个可运营的、甚至可能盈利的收购公司特许经营权。在那之后，玩家和角色可以按照你和他们的意愿，在任何方向上进行寻宝活动。",
	"Between episodes, characters will use downtime to undertake a variety of activities to better themselves or their franchise. By later episodes, choices of downtime activities might alter the flow and challenge of the story. After all, there's no rest for the wicked, so there shouldn't be rest for heroes either. (Logically then, wicked heroes would need to work twice as hard. Budget the time.) Familiarize yourself with the new activities presented in \"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime}\" in chapter 2 of this book, and with the standard D&D downtime activities discussed in that section.": "在两集之间，人物会利用停工期进行各种活动，以改善自己或其特许经营权。到后来的剧情中，对停工期活动的选择可能会改变故事的流程和挑战。毕竟，恶人是没有休息的，所以英雄也不应该有休息。(从逻辑上讲，邪恶的英雄需要加倍努力工作。编制时间预算）。熟悉本书第二章\"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime} \"中介绍的新活动，以及该节中讨论的标准D&D停工活动。",
	"The {@book Monster Manual|MM} contains stat blocks for most of the creatures found in this adventure. All the necessary stat blocks are included there or in {@book appendix B|AI|4}. When a creature's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue for you to look up the creature's stat block in the {@book Monster Manual|MM} or the monster appendix in this book.": "{@book Monster Manual|MM}包含了本冒险中发现的大多数生物的状态块。所有必要的状态块都包括在这里或{@book appendix B|AI|4}中。当一个生物的名字以{@b bold}的形式出现时，那是一个视觉提示，让你在{@book Monster Manual|MM}或本书的怪物附录中查找该生物的状态块。",
	"This part of the book is for the DM only. If you're planning to run through the adventure as a player, stop reading now! Unless you want to keep going, that is. Because seriously, it's not like anyone's going to stop you. After all, information is power—in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, and in life. Maybe you having a bit of an inside track is just what this adventure needs to make it really pop, and to keep the DM from getting all, \"Ooh, look at me! I'm the one with the secrets!\" I mean, can you believe how smug they are? It's like they're just begging you to turn the page...": "本书的这一部分只为管理员准备。如果你打算以玩家的身份进行冒险，现在就停止阅读吧！除非你想继续下去。除非你想继续下去，那就是。因为说真的，没有人会阻止你。毕竟，信息就是力量--在收购公司的活动中，以及在生活中。也许你有一点内幕消息正是这个冒险所需要的，以使它真正流行起来，并使DM不至于 \"哦，看我的！\"。我才是有秘密的人！\" 我的意思是，你能相信他们是多么自以为是吗？这就像他们只是在乞求你翻开这一页......",
	"The grand buffet that is an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign features plenty of the exciting locations and high adventure common to all great fantasy campaigns. But an Acq Inc game adds a unique helping of humor and corporate intrigue to the mix, creating a rich narrative familiar to anyone who's watched an Acquisitions Incorporated livestream game. To take full advantage of the potential of an Acq Inc campaign, keep the following concepts in mind.": "盛大的自助餐是收购公司的活动，其中有很多令人兴奋的地点和所有伟大的幻想活动中常见的高度冒险。但是，Acq公司的游戏在混合中加入了独特的幽默和企业阴谋，创造了丰富的叙事，这对任何观看过Acquisition Incorporated直播游戏的人来说都很熟悉。为了充分利用Acq公司活动的潜力，请牢记以下概念。",
	"This campaign provides many NPCs for you to do with as you please. They all have roles to play in the encounters and events of the adventure, but what happens to them after that is up to you. Every NPC could be a potential ally, enemy, or foil later in the campaign. If the players take a shine to one, bring that character back—or better yet, make the NPC an integral part of the ongoing plot. All franchises need servants and hirelings to do mundane jobs, and NPCs the characters already know are a great fit for these roles. Employ these NPCs to make the world feel more familiar and real to the players and characters alike.": "这个活动为你提供了许多NPC，你可以随意处置。他们在冒险的遭遇和事件中都有作用，但之后发生在他们身上的事情就取决于你了。每个NPC都可以成为潜在的盟友、敌人，或者在以后的活动中成为陪衬。如果玩家对某个角色感兴趣，就把这个角色带回来，或者更好的是，让这个NPC成为正在进行的情节的一个组成部分。所有的特许经营都需要仆人和雇工来做平凡的工作，而人物已经认识的NPC是这些角色的最佳人选。使用这些NPC，使玩家和角色对这个世界感到更加熟悉和真实。",
	"Even the most heroic heroes sometimes fall short. And in many cases, adventurers aren't even within longbow range of \"virtuous\" in their motivations. As such, what the characters fail to do, do poorly, or do wrongly can be just as important as what they accomplish. Don't let failure and setbacks derail an adventure or a campaign. Rather, look for ways that failure or partial success might lead to new ways to reach a campaign goal.": "即使是最英勇的英雄有时也会落空。而且在许多情况下，冒险家的动机甚至不在长弓的 \"美德 \"范围内。因此，角色的失败、做得不好或做得不对可能与他们的成就一样重要。不要让失败和挫折使冒险或活动脱轨。相反，要寻找失败或部分成功可能导致实现活动目标的新方法。",
	"You might be absolutely confident that the characters will save those townsfolk and earn their trust, letting you use the townsfolk to reveal an important quest goal. But if the town burns down despite the heroes' best intentions—or because they had better things to do—let them be mistaken for local authorities come to lend a hand in the aftermath. Or let them be unexpectedly arrested after being mistaken for the evil forces that burned the town down, and given the dangerous quest out of animosity. Humor plays a big part in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, so make use of unheroic irony whenever the players and characters provide it.": "你可能绝对相信人物会拯救那些乡民，并赢得他们的信任，让你利用乡民来揭示一个重要的任务目标。但是如果镇子被烧毁了，尽管英雄们的意图是好的，或者是因为他们有更好的事情要做，那么就让他们被误认为是当地政府来帮忙善后的。或者让他们在被误认为是烧毁小镇的邪恶势力后被意外逮捕，并因敌意而获得危险的任务。幽默在收购公司的活动中起着很大的作用，所以只要玩家和角色提供了非英雄式的讽刺，就可以利用它。",
	"Wow. Can you believe the advice your players are getting in that sidebar on the last page? And after all the time you're going to put in getting ready to run this adventure? Outrageous! Someone needs to teach these people a lesson.": "哇。你能相信你的玩家在最后一页的侧边栏中得到的建议吗？在你花了那么多时间准备进行这次冒险之后？太离谱了! 有人需要给这些人上一课。",
	"If you're running the adventure for larger or smaller groups, you can adjust the encounters using the guidelines given in chapter 3, \"{@book Creating Adventures|DMG|-1},\" in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. Or maybe you'll adjust them anyway to keep things interesting. And never forget that you can change up any aspects of the adventure to make them a better fit for your campaign. Swap monsters around to keep the players guessing, or make use of the adventure's many suggestions for side treks and additional encounters. That'll keep these so-called heroes in line.": "如果你为较大或较小的团体进行冒险，你可以使用第三章\"{@book Creating Adventures|DMG|-1} \"中给出的准则来调整遭遇战。也可能你会调整它们，以保持事情的趣味性。永远不要忘记，你可以改变冒险的任何方面，使它们更适合你的活动。把怪物换来换去，让玩家猜来猜去，或者利用冒险中的许多建议来进行旁门左道和额外的遭遇战。这将使这些所谓的英雄们保持一致。",
	"By its most basic nature, a roleplaying game campaign focuses on the actions of the characters. However, it's important to remember that the world goes on without them. The heroes can't be everywhere at once. If they establish a base in one town but spend a lot of time away, anything could happen to that base. Hirelings might grow disenchanted in the characters' service if abused, neglected, or left to their own devices for too long. Ramp up the drama and the humor of a campaign by occasionally focusing on what the characters neglected or left behind.": "就其最基本的性质而言，角色扮演游戏活动的重点是人物的行动。然而，重要的是要记住，没有他们，世界也在继续。英雄们不可能同时出现在任何地方。如果他们在一个城镇建立了一个基地，但却花了很多时间在外面，那么这个基地就可能发生任何事情。如果被虐待、被忽视或被放任自流太久，雇佣者可能会对人物的服务感到失望。通过偶尔关注人物被忽视或遗弃的东西来增加活动的戏剧性和幽默感。",
	"An Acquisitions Incorporated franchise is like a newborn baby that the characters all had a hand in conceiving, delivering, and raising. It needs constant care and feeding as it grows to its full potential, but there'll be a lot of risks, drama, and dirty diapers along the way. (Okay, that might be taking the analogy too far, but you get the idea.) Running a franchise can be difficult, but the potential rewards for the characters are tremendous. And for the players, making the franchise the focal point of the campaign provides a joint goal and a shared vessel of creative input.": "收购公司的特许经营权就像一个新生的婴儿，所有角色都参与了孕育、分娩和抚养。它需要不断的照顾和喂养，以充分发挥其潜力，但在这一过程中会有很多风险、戏剧和脏尿布。(好吧，这个比喻可能太远了，但你明白这个意思。)经营一个特许经营权可能是困难的，但对角色的潜在回报是巨大的。而对于玩家来说，将特许经营权作为活动的焦点，提供了一个共同的目标和一个共同的创造性投入的容器。",
	"This adventure touches on a number of classic tropes in its setup and execution. Artifact of incalculable power accidentally stumbled upon? Check. Evil faction with plans to end the world? Got it. But even against potentially world-shattering events and plots, an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign is always centered around humble characters making choices—including one unfortunate NPC whose choices have set the adventure in motion.": "这场冒险在其设置和执行过程中触及了许多经典套路。意外发现了具有不可估量的力量的神器？没错。计划结束世界的邪恶派别？是的。但是，即使是面对可能震惊世界的事件和阴谋，收购公司的活动总是围绕着卑微的角色做出选择--包括一个不幸的NPC，他的选择使冒险开始了。",
	"A year ago, a group of adventurers led by a dwarf named Caerhan Coalsmith found a strange object buried in the remains of a ruined tower. The relic appeared to be a golden orrery housing, missing its geared clockwork components. It was obviously a magic item of some kind, but arcane lore wasn't the party's strong suit, so the orrery was set aside while Caerhan investigated its provenance and history.": "一年前，由一个名叫Caerhan Coalsmith的矮人带领的一群冒险家发现了一个埋在废塔遗迹中的奇怪物体。这个遗物似乎是一个金色的口轮外壳，缺少了齿轮式的发条部件。这显然是某种魔法物品，但奥术理论并不是这个团队的强项，所以在卡伊尔汗调查它的来源和历史时，这个口簧被放在一边。",
	"The dwarf heard a few tales about devices that matched the relic's description. Though he never learned the full scope of its powers, rumors told of how those powers would increase if a magic orrery's missing components were collected and placed within it. Unfortunately, Caerhan also never learned about the curse the orrery carried—and his party paid the price.": "矮人听说过一些关于符合遗物描述的设备的故事。虽然他从未了解过它的全部力量，但有传言说，如果收集到一个魔法饰品的缺失部件并将其放入其中，这些力量就会增强。不幸的是，凯尔汉也从来没有了解过魔戒所携带的诅咒--他的队伍付出了代价。",
	"As an artifact, the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} comes with a random major detrimental property (see the \"{@book Artifacts|DMG|7|Artifacts}\" section in chapter 7 of the {@i {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG})}. The specifics of that property when the orrery housing was found are left up to you, but whatever it was (compulsion to evil for someone in the party, hostile life force, imprisoned death slaad, yadda yadda), Caerhan returned from a research trip to Candlekeep to find his fellow party members all dead.": "作为一件神器，{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}附带一个随机的主要有害属性（见{@i {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}第七章中的\"{@book Artifacts|DMG|7|Artifacts} \"部分）}。发现兽皮屋时，该属性的具体情况由你决定，但无论它是什么（对党内某人的强迫性邪恶，敌对的生命力，被囚禁的死亡之士，哒哒哒），Caerhan从Candlekeep的研究之旅回来时，发现他的党员同伴都死了。",
	"Recognizing too late that the orrery housing channeled dark power, the grieving Caerhan decided that the relic must be destroyed. However, its artifact-level magic made it seemingly impervious to harm. More research was undertaken with the help of Caerhan's goblin sidekick, Gorkoh. In the end, Caerhan concluded that the best place to ensure the orrery's end was a secret shrine to destruction beneath Waterdeep, rumored to be able to destroy even powerful magic relics. So the pair packed up and headed for the City of Splendors.": "悲痛欲绝的卡恩决定必须毁掉这个遗物，但他认识到这是黑暗力量的源泉，为时已晚。然而，它的神器级魔法使它似乎不受伤害。在Caerhan的妖精伙伴Gorkoh的帮助下，进行了更多的研究。最后，凯尔汉得出结论，确保神器终结的最佳地点是沃特迪普地下的一个秘密的毁灭神殿，据传它甚至能摧毁强大的魔法遗迹。于是两人收拾行装，前往辉煌之城。",
	"The veteran dwarf adventurer located the underground tunnels leading to the shrine easily enough. He and Gorkoh braved those dangerous passages, but were separated during an encounter with a carrion crawler. Caerhan pressed on. But when he activated the shrine, he caused a minor earthquake that opened a sinkhole in Waterdeep's Dock Ward, and which cracked walls and sidewalks across the city. In the end, the orrery housing was too strong even for the destructive power of the shrine, and Caerhan died during his heroic attempt to rid the world of the dangerous device. Now, the orrery waits for someone else to take possession of it.": "这位资深的矮人冒险家很容易就找到了通往神殿的地下通道。他和Gorkoh勇敢地走过这些危险的通道，但在遇到腐肉爬行者时被分开了。Caerhan继续前进。但当他启动神殿时，他引起了一场小地震，在沃特迪普的码头区打开了一个天坑，并使整个城市的墙壁和人行道开裂。最后，即使对于神龛的破坏力来说，箭塔的外壳也太强大了，卡伊尔汗在他为世界摆脱危险装置的英勇尝试中死去。现在，这个神器正等待着别人来拥有它。",
	"As the characters will learn in time, the orrery and its components were intentionally scattered long ago. But the pieces of the orrery maintain a connection, and have been steadily making their way toward each other for years. With one piece permanently held by the orrery's creator in the Greypeak Mountains, the other components and the orrery housing have ended up scattered across the Sword Coast, falling into the hands of different adventuring groups. One of those groups is the evil faction known as the Six, whose members have become aware of the orrery's existence—and have a full understanding of its potential for destructive power. That power is described in the orrery write-up in {@book appendix D|AI|6}.": "正如主人公将及时了解到的那样，这个金字塔和它的组成部分在很久以前就被有意地分散了。但是金字塔的碎片保持着一种联系，多年来一直在稳定地走向彼此。其中一块由位于格雷皮亚克山脉的神器创造者永久持有，其他部件和神器外壳最终散落在整个剑海岸，落入不同的冒险团体手中。其中一个团体是被称为 \"六人帮 \"的邪恶派别，他们的成员已经意识到了箭塔的存在--并且完全了解其潜在的破坏性力量。这股力量在{@book appendix D|AI|6}中的口诀中有所描述。",
	"As the characters are drawn into contact with the orrery, they discover that two of the artifact's components have been claimed by Acquisitions Incorporated franchises that have come under recent attack by unknown foes. The rival faction of Dran Enterprises becomes a prime suspect, with its agents found on the scene for both attacks. And all the while, the shadowy members of the Six pull together a tangled plot to gain control of the orrery to destroy Acquisitions Incorporated—and bring ruin to Faerûn.": "当这些人物被吸引去接触神器时，他们发现神器的两个部件已经被收购公司的特许经营权认领，而这些特许经营权最近遭到了未知敌人的攻击。德兰企业的敌对派别成为主要嫌疑人，它的代理人被发现在两次袭击的现场。与此同时，\"六人帮 \"的阴暗成员还策划了一个纠缠不清的阴谋，以获得对神器的控制权，从而摧毁收购公司--为法鲁恩带来毁灭。",
	"As the adventure unfolds, the characters travel hither and yon across the Sword Coast and the North, checking in on some classic adventure locations and exploring a number of brand-new sites. Map 1.1 shows the sites and locations featured in \"The Orrery of the Wanderer.\"": "随着冒险的展开，角色们在剑海岸和北方的各个地方旅行，查看一些经典的冒险地点，并探索一些全新的地点。地图1.1显示了 \"流浪者的奥瑞尔 \"中的景点和地点。",
	"In episode 1 of the adventure, a case of mistaken identity gives the characters a rare opportunity to make a name for themselves in Acquisitions Incorporated. Their assigned task is to investigate a sinkhole fissure that opened up in Waterdeep after a small earthquake struck the city—the side effect of Caerhan Coalsmith's failed attempt to destroy the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}. If the characters can conclude the investigation successfully, Acquisitions Incorporated CEO Omin Dran presents them with a unique chance to rise within the ranks of the organization.": "在冒险的第一集里，一个错误的身份给了人物一个难得的机会，让他们在收购公司里扬名立万。他们的任务是调查沃特迪普市在发生小地震后出现的天坑裂缝--这是卡恩-库尔斯密斯摧毁{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}的尝试失败后的副作用。如果角色们能成功完成调查，收购公司的首席执行官Omin Dran会给他们提供一个独特的机会，让他们在组织中晋升。",
	"Before diving headlong into the events of \"The Orrery of the Wanderer\" campaign, you might wish to spend some time having the characters experience and explore the city of Waterdeep. The adventure {@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH} and the \"Volo's Waterdeep Enchiridion\" section of that book (available at the DMs Guild as a separate download—{@link www.dmsguild.com|http://www.dmsguild.com}) provide a ton of information about the City of Splendors.": "在一头扎进 \"流浪者的修道院 \"活动之前，你可能希望花一些时间让角色体验和探索沃特德普城。这个冒险{@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH}和该书中的 \"沃特德普百科全书 \"部分（可在DMs公会单独下载-{@link www.dmsguild.com|http://www.dmsguild.com}）提供了大量关于辉煌之城的信息。",
	"Additionally, you can make use of the following rumors that characters might hear on the streets or in the taverns of that great metropolis. Some of these rumors tie to the adventure, while the truth of others depends on your wishes for the campaign. Either way, feel free to use these rumors as inspiration for new encounters or side treks.": "此外，你还可以利用以下传言，这些传言是人物在那个大都市的街头或酒馆里可能听到的。其中一些谣言与冒险有关，而其他谣言的真相则取决于你对活动的愿望。无论怎样，请自由使用这些传言作为新的遭遇或侧重点的灵感。",
	"Omin Dran is one of the fabled Masked Lords of Waterdeep. His presence on the council is the impetus for beneficial changes sweeping across the city.": "奥明-德兰是传说中的水底世界蒙面领主之一。他在议会中的存在是席卷整个城市的有益变化的推动力。",
	"Omin Dran is definitely not one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep. The addition to the council of such a power-hungry and ruthless individual would spell the end of the rule of law in the City of Splendors.": "奥明-德兰绝对不是水底城的假面领主之一。这样一个渴望权力、冷酷无情的人加入议会，将意味着辉煌之城的法治的终结。",
	"The earthquake that hit the city two days ago wasn't natural. Strong magic unleashed underground caused it—maybe even magic from Undermountain.": "两天前袭击城市的地震并不是自然的。地下释放的强大魔法造成了它--甚至可能是来自地下山的魔法。",
	"Acquisitions Incorporated is making a play for control in the city, and the other power groups of Waterdeep are not going to let that happen without a fight. The recent hostilities between groups such as the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim have been made even worse by the increasing sway of the company.": "收购公司正在争夺城市的控制权，而沃特迪普的其他势力团体也不会让这种情况不经意间发生。最近Xanathar公会和Zhentarim等团体之间的敌对行动，由于该公司的影响力越来越大而变得更加严重。",
	"A noble merchant in the South Ward survived an assassination attempt last night. A female half-elf was seen fleeing the scene, bearing a deep cut on her shoulder from a bodyguard's blade. A 50 gp bounty has been offered for bringing her in alive for questioning.": "昨晚，南区的一位贵族商人在一次暗杀行动中幸存下来。有人看到一名女性半精灵逃离了现场，她的肩膀上有一道被保镖的刀子划破的伤口。有人悬赏50金币，希望能活捉她进行审问。",
	"A killer is stalking the streets of the North Ward, murdering people in broad daylight. The victims' feet are chopped off, as if by a powerful blow with a sharp blade. Then they're decapitated. The heads are left behind, but the feet are taken!": "一个杀手在北区的街道上徘徊，在光天化日之下谋杀人们。受害者的脚被砍掉，就像被一把锋利的刀子强力打击一样。然后他们被斩首。头部被留下，但脚却被带走了!",
	"The famous Waterdavian actor Tystanya Creed has not been seen since leaving the theatre after her last performance several days ago. Her adoring fans fear she is dead.": "著名的Waterdavian演员Tystanya Creed在几天前最后一次演出后离开剧院后就再也没有出现过。她的崇拜者担心她已经死了。",
	"Towering forms in black cloaks have been seen around the City of the Dead at night. A number of witnesses swear that those cloaks and their deep hoods concealed skeletal forms.": "夜晚，人们在死亡之城周围看到穿着黑色斗篷的高大身影。一些目击者发誓，这些斗篷和它们的深色罩子掩盖了骷髅的形状。",
	"A green dragon was spotted flying over the Sea of Swords just west of the city. The Blackstaff and her team are on high alert in case it ventures closer or harasses ships in the area.": "一条绿龙被发现在城市西部的剑海上空飞行。黑杖和她的团队正处于高度警惕状态，以防它冒险靠近或骚扰该地区的船只。",
	"One of the great walking statues of Waterdeep has been reported to be crying over the last three days. No one is sure about the cause of this watery discharge from the eyes, but some say it means the destruction of the City of Splendors is imminent! Others are certain it's a sign of great fortune on the horizon. Still others say it's just the humidity.": "据报道，在过去的三天里，沃特德普的一个伟大的步行雕像一直在哭泣。没有人确定这种眼睛流泪的原因，但有人说这意味着辉煌之城的毁灭迫在眉睫! 另一些人则肯定这是一个伟大的财富即将到来的标志。还有人说这只是湿度问题。",
	"Members of the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters are going on strike, leaving the streets of Waterdeep dark and dangerous around the next new moon. The thieves and assassins of the city are already getting prepared for a night of carnage.": "Chandlers和Lamplighters公会的成员正在进行罢工，在下一个新月前后，水底世界的街道将变得黑暗而危险。这个城市的盗贼和刺客们已经开始为一夜的屠杀做准备了。",
	"The adventure begins with the characters seeking franchise opportunities or internships at the Waterdeep offices of Acquisitions Incorporated. All the characters should know the popular tales of that well-known organization and might have ties to Acq Inc (especially characters with one of the {@book backgrounds|AI|2|Backgrounds} from {@book chapter 3|AI|2}).": "冒险开始时，人物在收购公司的Waterdeep办公室寻求特许经营机会或实习机会。所有的角色都应该知道那个著名组织的流行故事，并且可能与Acq公司有联系（尤其是与{@book chapter 3|AI|2}的{@book backgrounds|AI|2|Backgrounds}之一的角色）。",
	"Sure, I get it. Your first time meeting Omin Dran can be intimidating. But just remember, under all that armor is a merciless psychopath infused with the power of a god.": "当然，我明白。你第一次见到奥明德兰可能会被吓到。但请记住，在所有的盔甲下是一个被注入神的力量的无情的精神病患者。",
	"For a nervously long length of time, the characters are kept waiting in a conference room at Head Office. Read or paraphrase the following to begin:": "在一段紧张的时间里，这些人物一直在总部的会议室里等待。阅读或转述以下内容，开始。",
	"Your inquiries into internships and franchise opportunities at Acquisitions Incorporated have gone even better than you'd hoped. Ridiculous rumors talk about how prospective interns of Acq Inc aren't always treated with respect, dignity, or care. Even more ridiculous tales of interns dying at an alarming rate are told throughout the city. Thankfully, you don't believe a word of any of that.": "你对收购公司的实习和特许经营机会的询问比你希望的还要顺利。荒谬的传言谈到Acq公司的未来实习生并不总是受到尊重、尊严和关怀。整个城市还流传着关于实习生以惊人的速度死亡的更荒唐的故事。值得庆幸的是，你一个字都不相信。",
	"So far, everyone at Head Office has treated you with kindness, and even a bit of deference. You were shown into this elegant conference room, given fine food and drink, and asked to wait to speak with none other than Omin Dran—founder and CEO of this august organization.": "到目前为止，总部的每个人都对你很客气，甚至有点恭敬。你被带进了这个优雅的会议室，得到了精美的食物和饮料，并被要求等待与这个庄严组织的创始人兼首席执行官奥明-德兰交谈。",
	"If the characters already know each other, they were ushered into the conference room as a group. If they came to Head Office separately, they were each brought in alone and asked to wait with the others, and have a chance to introduce themselves before Omin appears.": "如果这些人物已经互相认识，他们就会被作为一个团体带进会议室。如果他们分别来到总部，他们各自被单独带入，并被要求与其他人一起等待，并在奥明出现之前有机会介绍自己。",
	"It isn't long before the door to the conference room opens, and an intense-looking half-elf in plate armor enters. He wears a holy symbol of Tymora, the goddess of fortune, around his neck. It's Omin Dran! With no introduction, the CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated speaks.": "没过多久，会议室的门打开了，一个身穿板甲、神情紧张的半精灵走了进来。他的脖子上戴着财富女神泰莫拉的神圣标志。这就是奥明-德兰! 不用介绍，收购公司的首席执行官就开口了。",
	"\"Thank you for answering my call so quickly. When the earthquake struck the city two days ago, damage was limited, but a sinkhole opened up a fissure beneath an abandoned warehouse in Dock Ward. Two City Watch guards entered the fissure to investigate, but never came out. They're now feared dead, and the City Watch has asked me to take over the investigation. But my schedule is complicated at the moment, so I'm delegating that job to you. As an experienced adventuring group, I have no doubt that you can handle the task.\"": "\"谢谢你这么快就接了我的电话。两天前地震发生时，损失有限，但一个天坑在码头区一个废弃的仓库下面打开了一个裂缝。两名城市守卫进入裂缝进行调查，但再也没有出来。他们现在恐怕已经死了，而城市守望要求我接手调查。但我现在的日程安排很复杂，所以我把这项工作委托给你。作为一个经验丰富的冒险团，我毫不怀疑你们能处理好这项任务。\"",
	"Then without another word, Omin Dran turns and leaves the room.": "然后没有再说话，奥明德兰转身离开了房间。",
	"Through a crazy and never-to-be-explained misunderstanding, Omin believes that the characters are a group of experienced adventurers that he put out a call for just the day before. If the characters attempt to correct this misunderstanding, he ignores them. The CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated has important business to deal with, and can't be bothered with such trifles.": "通过一个疯狂的、无法解释的误解，Omin认为这些角色是他前一天刚发出的一群有经验的冒险家。如果角色们试图纠正这种误解，他就不理会他们。收购公司的首席执行官有重要的业务要处理，不可能为这些琐事而烦恼。",
	"When visiting Head Office, never approach Omin directly. Use the proper forms and filing procedures. After a brief four-month waiting time, you will be granted a very generous sixty-second meeting. It'll be the best minute of your life.": "在访问总部时，切勿直接接近Omin。使用适当的表格和备案程序。在短暂的四个月等待时间后，你将获得一次非常慷慨的六十秒会面。这将是你生命中最好的一分钟。",
	"With absolutely no idea what they're meant to do or how they got into this position, the characters might try to seek out assistance before they leave Head Office. Or they might just wander around lost for a bit. Either way, Jim Darkmagic approaches the group with some words of... well, let's call it wisdom. When it's time for Jim to make his appearance, read or paraphrase the following:": "由于完全不知道自己要做什么，也不知道自己是怎么走到这一步的，这些人物可能会在离开总部之前试图寻求帮助。或者，他们可能只是迷路了一下。无论哪种情况，吉姆-黑魔王都会用一些......嗯，让我们称之为智慧的话来接近这群人。当吉姆出场的时候，请阅读或解读以下内容。",
	"A puff of smoke erupts out of nowhere. As the haze disperses, a handsome figure steps forward. It's Jim Darkmagic of the New Hampshire Darkmagics! Except he's wearing a set of glasses that he apparently thinks is an effective disguise as he bows before you.": "一股烟雾不知从何处爆发出来。随着烟雾的散去，一个英俊的身影走了出来。那是新罕布什尔州黑暗魔术团的吉姆-黑暗魔术师！他是新罕布什尔州黑暗魔术师。只是他戴着一副眼镜，显然他认为这是一种有效的伪装，因为他在你面前鞠躬。",
	"\"I'm no one you know,\" he says. \"But I couldn't help but notice that you seem a little flustered. I believe Omin just offered you work. And I also have a feeling you might not be the adventurers he thinks you are.\"": "\"我不是你认识的人，\"他说。\"但我忍不住注意到，你似乎有点慌乱。我相信奥明刚刚给你提供了工作。而且我也有一种感觉，你们可能不是他认为的冒险家。\"",
	"Jim looks around to make sure no one else is listening in, then leans forward to deliver a conspiratorial whisper. \"You want my advice? Do the job. If you can pull it off, Omin will be so impressed that you'll have a leg up on everybody else trying to gain footing with the company. You've heard the phrase \"opportunity knocks?\" Well, opportunity is heading right at your door with a battering ram. Stand in that doorway, friends. Let opportunity smash its way in.\"": "吉姆环顾四周，确保没有其他人在偷听，然后俯身向前，发出阴谋论的低语。\"你想要我的建议吗？做好这项工作。如果你能成功，奥明会对你刮目相看，你会比其他想在公司立足的人更有优势。你听说过 \"机会来了 \"这句话吗？那么，机会正带着敲门砖向你走来。朋友们，请站在门口。让机会砸进来。\"",
	"Jim's reasons for interceding with the characters are left to your determination. He might have intercepted the experienced adventurers Omin called for, then sent them off on a secret personal mission on his own behalf. Or he might have accidentally set them on fire when they arrived at Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office. Whatever the case, he needs the players' group to attempt Omin's mission, and he's keen to get them on their way.": "吉姆与这些人物交涉的原因由你决定。他可能拦截了奥明要求的有经验的冒险家，然后以他自己的名义派他们去执行一项秘密的个人任务。或者当他们到达收购公司总部时，他可能不小心放火烧了他们。不管是什么情况，他需要玩家的团队去尝试Omin的任务，而且他很想让他们上路。",
	"If the characters attempt to sort the case of mistaken identity out, Jim tells them Omin is unavailable, and concedes that they don't have to take the job. He points out that the characters are welcome to leave Acq Inc and never come back. But Omin might want to have words with them later about the dastardly way they misrepresented themselves.": "如果角色们试图弄清这个错误的身份，吉姆告诉他们奥明没有空，并承认他们不一定要接受这份工作。他指出，欢迎这些人物离开Acq公司，不再回来。但是奥明可能想在以后和他们谈谈他们错误陈述自己的卑鄙行为。",
	"After finishing up at Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office, the adventurers can set off to perform their appointed mission.": "在收购公司总部结束后，冒险家们可以出发去执行他们指定的任务。",
	"Jim Darkmagic is... uh... How do I put this? He's, uh... hmm. Let me get back to you.": "Jim Darkmagic是...呃...我怎么说呢？他是，呃......嗯。让我给你回话。",
	"Omin's assignment takes the characters to Dock Ward in Waterdeep, a maze of seedy tenements, rough streets, and even rougher alleyways. If the characters have spent time in the city, they might have heard that much of this ward is set up as safe houses, meeting places, and fronts for a variety of criminal organizations, including the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim. None of these groups are particularly happy right now, since the sinkhole caused by the earthquake opened up smack dab in the middle of their territory. The sinkhole also brought the Waterdeep City Watch to the ward, a move welcomed by no one—least of all the members of the Watch, who must now stand guard over the site until it can be investigated and closed.": "Omin的任务是把角色带到Waterdeep的Dock Ward，一个由肮脏的公寓、粗糙的街道和更粗糙的小巷组成的迷宫。如果角色们在这个城市呆过，他们可能听说这个区的大部分地方都被设置成安全屋、聚会场所，以及各种犯罪组织的幌子，包括Xanathar公会和Zhentarim。这些组织现在都不太高兴，因为地震造成的天坑正好开在他们的地盘中间。这个天坑还把沃特迪普城市守卫队带到了病房，此举没有人欢迎，尤其是守卫队的成员，他们现在必须在现场站岗，直到调查和关闭。",
	"A character whose background entails knowledge of the ward knows the general layout of its streets and alleys, but finding Jolly's Lamp Emporium and the abandoned warehouse requires asking for directions at some point. Use the following encounters as a general setup, but you can add additional encounters as the characters make their way through the ward as you see fit.": "一个背景需要了解该区的人物知道其街道和小巷的大致布局，但要找到乔利的灯饰店和废弃的仓库需要在某些时候问路。你可以把下面的遭遇作为一般的设置，但你可以在人物通过病房时增加你认为合适的其他遭遇。",
	"As the adventurers make their way through the streets of Dock Ward, they come upon an unlikely commercial venture.": "当冒险家们穿过码头区的街道时，他们遇到了一个不太可能的商业冒险。",
	"A ramshackle stall set up along the street bears a sign that reads: \"Maps and Poshuns.\" Working the stall is a filthy but cheerful gnome urchin. Several pieces of parchment are on display in the stall, with six small ceramic pots placed next to them.": "一个沿街摆放的破烂摊位上挂着一个牌子，上面写着。\"地图和Poshuns\"。摆摊的是一个脏兮兮但却很欢快的地精顽童。摊位上摆着几张羊皮纸，旁边放着六个小陶罐。",
	"The potions have a faintly fruity aroma. A {@spell detect magic} spell shows that they are indeed magical, though that magic is of the transmutation school rather than conjuration. Each day, a kindly druid who thinks Jerr is an honest soul gives the gnome a goodberry for his health. Rather than eat the berry, Jerr crushes it up and adds a drop of juice to each pot. Jerr sells maps for 1 gp and the potions for 10 gp. He also tries to sell other useless or counterfeit objects at your discretion.": "这些药水有一种淡淡的水果香味。一个{@spell detect magic}的咒语显示它们确实有魔力，尽管这种魔力是转化学派的，而不是魔法。每天，一个好心的德鲁伊认为杰尔是一个诚实的灵魂，他给地精一个好的浆果，让他健康。杰尔没有吃浆果，而是把它压碎，在每个锅里加一滴果汁。杰尔以1戈比出售地图，以10戈比出售药水。他还试图出售其他无用或伪造的物品，由你决定。",
	"If you wish, Jerr can become a recurring character in the campaign. He might keep tabs on the characters as they grow famous, showing up in cities where they travel, trying to sell more useless goods, or eventually spying on them for the Zhentarim. Or if paid and treated well, he could become a valuable source of information for the characters when they need someone to infiltrate tough areas.": "如果你愿意，杰尔可以成为活动中的一个重复出现的角色。他可能会在人物成名后盯着他们，出现在他们旅行的城市里，试图出售更多无用的货物，或者最终为Zhentarim监视他们。或者，如果得到报酬和良好的待遇，当人物需要有人潜入艰难地区时，他可以成为一个有价值的信息来源。",
	"As the characters make their way farther into Dock Ward, they encounter street thugs growing increasing resentful of the presence of the City Watch. These thugs need to earn some quick coin, then lay low until the Watch leaves the ward. And mugging the next group of distracted strangers to wander down the wrong street seems like just the ticket.": "随着人物深入到码头区，他们遇到了街头暴徒，对城市守望的存在越来越反感。这些暴徒需要快速赚取一些钱财，然后在守望先锋离开区之前低调行事。抢劫下一群在错误的街道上徘徊的心不在焉的陌生人，这似乎正是机会。",
	"The four {@creature bandit} members of the crew are run-of-the-mill criminals looking to get ahead in the world through treachery. Their leader, {@creature Jelayne|OoW}, was similar... until she was killed a year before. {@creature Jelayne|OoW} wasn't one to let death keep her down, however, and she continues to lead the group as an unusual {@creature skeleton} with these changes:": "船员中的四个{@creature bandit}成员是普通的罪犯，希望通过背叛在这个世界上出人头地。他们的首领{@creature Jelayne|OoW}也是如此......直到一年前她被杀。然而，{@creature Jelayne|OoW}并不是一个让死亡阻挡她的人，她继续作为一个不寻常的{@creature skeleton}来领导这个团体，而这些变化。",

	"The other members of the crew hide in adjacent alleyways or on the rooftop of a nearby building. They enter the fray if the characters don't surrender their valuables immediately.": "其他成员躲在邻近的巷子里或附近建筑物的屋顶上。如果这些人物不立即交出他们的贵重物品，他们就会加入战斗。",
	"If the adventurers defeat the crew and study {@creature Jelayne|OoW}, a successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Religion}) check confirms that she was raised as undead by a unique ritual that allowed her to keep her intellect and ability to speak. This has no bearing on the encounter, but sets up the existence of such rituals as foreshadowing for later events. See the \"{@area A Horse is a Corpse, of Course|088|x}\" section and \"{@area The Magic of Convenience|08e|x}\" sidebar in episode 2 for more information.": "如果冒险者打败了船员并研究了{@creature Jelayne|OoW}，成功通过DC10智力({@skill Arcana}或{@skill Religion})检查，证实她是由一个独特的仪式养成的不死生物，使她能够保持智力和说话的能力。这对这次遭遇没有影响，但为以后的事件埋下了这种仪式存在的伏笔。更多信息请参见第二集的\"{@area A Horse is a Corpse, of Course|088|x} \"部分和\"{@area The Magic of Convenience|08e|x} \"侧边栏。",
	"If the characters develop a strong interest in creating undead horses or summoning will-o'-wisps to their service, you can decide to reveal the \"unique rituals\" Hoobur knows, which can show up as treasure in the adventure or be something that the characters can learn through research. Otherwise, just assume that like many classic villains, Hoobur Gran'Shoop has access to whatever magic is necessary to advance the plot in the most interesting way.": "如果人物对创造不死马或召唤精灵为他们服务产生了浓厚的兴趣，你可以决定揭示胡伯所知道的 \"独特的仪式\"，这些仪式可以在冒险中作为宝物出现，也可以是人物可以通过研究学会的东西。否则，就假设像许多经典的反派一样，胡伯-格兰肖普可以使用任何必要的魔法，以最有趣的方式推进情节。",

	"Continuing on through Dock Ward, the characters catch unexpected sight of a kidnapping.": "继续穿过Dock Ward，人物意外地看到了一起绑架案。",
	"An old male human hobbles up the street, his long staff bearing most of his weight. His wrinkled face tells a tale of many hard years lived in poverty. As he passes an alleyway entrance, he looks up at you and grins, revealing his last few remaining teeth. But even as he opens his mouth as if to speak, a pair of meaty gray arms emerge from the alley entrance and yank him into the darkness.": "一个年老的男性人类蹒跚地走在街上，他的长杖承受着他的大部分重量。他那张布满皱纹的脸诉说着多年来在贫困中生活的艰辛。当他经过一个小巷的入口时，他抬头看着你，咧嘴一笑，露出了他仅存的几颗牙齿。但就在他张开嘴似乎要说话的时候，一双肉乎乎的灰色手臂从巷子口冒了出来，把他拽进了黑暗中。",

She saves her spells to aid her escape rather than using them offensively.": "大古斯塔瓦是二人组的肌肉。{@creature Devil Dog|OoW}不受伤害，如果看起来情况可能变得很糟糕，就迅速逃离。她保存她的法术来帮助她逃跑，而不是用它们来进攻。",
	"The thugs grabbed Kal because they heard the old fool can predict the future. They don't want to hurt him, but simply hope to persuade him to help them make as much coin as possible with little risk.": "这些暴徒抓住了卡尔，因为他们听说这个老傻瓜能预测未来。他们并不想伤害他，只是希望说服他帮助他们在风险不大的情况下尽可能多地赚取钱财。",
	"If the characters save Kal, he looks at them with the same grin. He doesn't express gratitude, though, because his mind wanders through a different level of existence, as is the case for many mystics, celebrities, and financial planners. He laughs when asked a question. He answers questions that no one asked. He nods but says no, or vice versa, even when he has no reason to do so. However, when the second sight grips him, all that changes.": "如果这些人物救了卡尔，他也会用同样的笑容看着他们。不过他并不表示感谢，因为他的思想在不同层次的存在中徘徊，就像许多神秘主义者、名人和财务规划师一样。当被问到一个问题时，他笑了。他回答没有人问的问题。他点头却说不，或者反过来说，即使他没有理由这样做。然而，当第二道视线抓住他时，这一切都改变了。",
	"Kal's eyes come into focus and he becomes as sober as a priest of Ilmater at sunup. \"Their plans are afoot,\" he whispers. \"Their staff are ready. Their balance sheets are totaled, and that total is grim. They mean to bring the end of all things! You must seek the magic! Only you can stop them! Only you! You... are who again, sorry?\"": "卡尔的眼睛开始聚焦，他变得像日出时分伊尔马特的牧师一样清醒。\"他们的计划正在进行中，\"他低声说。\"他们的工作人员已经准备好了。他们的资产负债表已经计算出来了，而这个数字是严峻的。他们的目的是带来万物的终结! 你必须寻找魔法! 只有你能阻止他们! 只有你! 你......是谁来着，对不起？\"",
	"After this suitably dramatic and stylishly vague telegraphing of the adventure's archplot, Kal reverts to his normal abnormal state of mind for good.": "在这一适当的戏剧性和时尚模糊的冒险情节的预告之后，卡尔永远地恢复了他正常的不正常的心理状态。",

	"{@creature Devil Dog|OoW} carries nothing of value, but in exchange for her life, she promises to take her captors back to her apartment, where she says she keeps her money.

	"Eventually, the characters spot the sign for Jolly's Lamp Emporium. Read the following as they move toward their goal:": "最后，这些人物发现了乔利灯饰店的招牌。在他们朝着目标前进时，请阅读以下内容。",
	"Jolly's Lamp Emporium is an unassuming, ramshackle shop in the midst of other unassuming, ramshackle shops—including the collapsed warehouse next door.

No one else is on the street, except a seemingly inebriated halfling who stumbles toward you.": "Jolly's Lamp Emporium是一家不起眼的破烂商店，位于其他不起眼的破烂商店中间--包括隔壁的倒塌的仓库。当你走近时，附近商店和公寓里的人们透过他们的百叶窗警惕地看着你。在仓库旁边，有三名沃特迪普城市守卫的成员站岗。街上没有其他人，只有一个看起来醉醺醺的半身人跌跌撞撞地向你走来。",

	"When the characters approach, Captain Truff steps forward, tells them that the area is off-limits, and orders them to move along. When the characters get across the purpose of their presence (most easily by stating that Omin Dran sent them), Truff is clearly relieved, though still not entirely friendly.": "当这些人物走近时，特鲁夫船长走上前去，告诉他们这个区域是禁区，并命令他们继续前进。当角色们明白了他们出现的目的（最容易的是说明是奥明德兰派他们来的），特鲁夫显然松了一口气，尽管仍然不完全友好。",

	"Captain Truff's scroll contains the names of the members of the adventuring party that Omin Dran thought he hired to do this job. The number of names conveniently matches the number of characters, and can include any of the following:": "特鲁夫船长的卷轴包含了奥明德兰认为他雇佣的冒险团成员的名字，以完成这项工作。名字的数量很方便地与人物的数量相匹配，可以包括以下任何一种。",

	"To gain access to the warehouse and the sinkhole fissure, the characters must pretend to be the named adventurers. Assume that the City Watch members know the names and reputations of some of the adventurers on the list, but have never met them in person. If a character pretends to be Lord Pompy Fuggelstruck and speaks to the guards, Captain Truff might think it odd that they aren't speaking with Fuggelstruck's well-known lisp, or predilection for using rhyming couplets, or what have you. You can let roleplaying determine the outcome, or call for DC 10 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) checks for the characters to pass off any outright lies.": "为了进入仓库和天坑裂缝，角色们必须假装是被点名的冒险家。假设城市守望的成员知道名单上一些冒险家的名字和名声，但从未见过他们本人。如果一个角色假装是Pompy Fuggelstruck勋爵并和守卫说话，Truff队长可能会觉得奇怪，因为他们没有用Fuggelstruck著名的口齿不清，或者喜欢使用押韵的对联，或者其他什么。你可以让角色扮演来决定结果，或者要求对人物进行DC10魅力（{@skill Deception}）检查，以掩盖任何公然的谎言。",
	"Captain Truff is eager to get someone—anyone—to investigate the fissure as soon as possible, allowing her to go back to her normal duties.

	"Once the characters' identities are \"confirmed,\" they might have some questions for the guards. Use the following points to steer the conversation—and make sure to work in the first three points as a warning from the guards, even if the players fail to seek more information:": "一旦角色的身份被 \"确认\"，他们可能会有一些问题要问守卫。使用以下几点来引导对话--确保将前三点作为守卫的警告，即使玩家没有寻求更多信息。",
	"The fissure opened beneath the warehouse during the earthquake two days ago. The partially collapsed building has been deemed structurally sound, so it shouldn't fall into the fissure unless someone inside does something foolish, such as knock down a support beam or bang against the remaining walls.": "两天前的地震中，仓库下面的裂缝打开了。部分倒塌的建筑被认为结构良好，所以它应该不会落入裂缝，除非里面有人做了一些愚蠢的事情，比如打倒一根支撑梁或撞到剩余的墙壁。",

	"The contract the characters sign is fulfilled only if they investigate and clear every tunnel the fissure exposed. After they finish, a city surveyor will be assigned to map the area, and an engineer needs to assess the integrity of the tunnels to ensure that no further collapses are imminent.

	"Two members of the City Watch—Sergeant Ava Teeshe and Constable Yander Boot—descended into the fissure a day earlier to make sure it held nothing dangerous. From the bottom of the sinkhole, they followed an underground passage north. They haven't been seen or heard from since.": "城市守望的两名成员--阿瓦-提舍中士和扬德-布特警员--在一天前潜入裂缝，以确保其中没有危险。从天坑底部，他们沿着地下通道向北走。此后，他们再也没有被人看到或听到。",
	"Sergeant Teeshe is a tall, strapping female human who has seen her share of scuffles and doesn't back down from a fight. If something took her out, it must be powerful.": "Teeshe警长是一个高大魁梧的女性人类，她见过她的混战，在战斗中不会退缩。如果有什么东西把她干掉了，那一定很厉害。",

	"The three guards have been ordered to remain on site until the exploration of the fissure is complete. Captain Truff is clear in articulating her hopes that the adventurers can wrap up the investigation quickly. Every second she spends in this unruly section of Dock Ward grates on her nerves.": "三名守卫被命令留在现场，直到完成对裂缝的探索。特鲁夫船长明确表示，她希望冒险家们能够迅速结束调查。她在Dock Ward这个不守规矩的地方度过的每一秒钟都让她感到不安。",

	"When the fissure opened up at the bottom of the sinkhole, it exposed a number of tunnels used for a variety of purposes and by a multitude of people over the years. The first of the tunnels beneath the warehouse were dug as smugglers' byways. Later, worshipers of That-Which-Endures (see the sidebar in the \"{@book New Race: Verdan|AI|2|New Race: Verdan}\" section in chapter 3) excavated chambers beneath the ground to hold clandestine meetings and worship at a secret shrine of destruction. Various thieves' guilds employed the tunnels to move from place to place secretly. Renegade wizards did terrible experiments there. At one point, part of the Waterdeep sewer system crossed into the tunnel network. Not long after, the subterranean spaces were abandoned.": "当天坑底部的裂缝打开时，它暴露了许多隧道，多年来被许多人用于不同的目的。仓库下面的第一条隧道是作为走私者的通道而挖掘的。后来，那啥啥的崇拜者（见第三章\"{@book New Race: Verdan|AI|2|New Race: Verdan} \"部分的侧边栏）在地下挖掘了一些房间，举行秘密会议，并在一个秘密的毁灭圣地进行崇拜。各种盗贼行会利用这些隧道从一个地方秘密地转移到另一个地方。叛逆的巫师们在那里做着可怕的实验。有一次，沃特迪普下水道系统的一部分穿过了隧道网络。不久之后，地下空间被遗弃了。",
	"As a result of the earthquake, many of the tunnel system's side passages have been blocked by rubble. The limited zone that is still traversable leads the characters from the fissure to the lost shrine of destruction—and through a number of dangerous areas in between.": "由于地震的影响，隧道系统的许多侧面通道都被瓦砾堵住了。仍可穿越的有限区域将人物从裂缝引向失落的毁灭圣地--并在两者之间穿过一些危险区域。",
	"When the adventurers enter the warehouse, read:": "当冒险者进入仓库时，请阅读。",
	"In the areas where the walls and ceiling didn't collapse, this warehouse contains no crates, no boxes, no barrels, and no wares of any other kind. Directly in front of the missing door, the walls, ceiling, and floor have fallen away to reveal a deep sinkhole fissure. Inside the ruin, a hempen rope anchored firmly in the rubble dangles down into the darkness. The tear in the earth descends at an angle, making it impossible to see how far down it goes or what waits at the bottom.": "在墙壁和天花板没有倒塌的地方，这个仓库里没有板条箱，没有盒子，没有木桶，也没有任何其他种类的物品。在缺失的门的正前方，墙壁、天花板和地板已经脱落，露出一个深深的天坑裂缝。在这个废墟里，一条牢牢固定在瓦砾中的麻绳垂落在黑暗中。地面上的裂缝以一定的角度下降，使人无法看到它有多深，也无法看到底部有什么在等待着。",

	"The sinkhole fissure ends at a level floor of worked stone. Dust, debris, rocks, and pieces of wood that once made up the walls and ceiling of the warehouse above are spread across the floor. An underground passage is blocked to the south, but it continues into darkness to the north. Two pairs of human-sized boot prints, easily spotted in the dust, head northward. Smaller fissures, holes, and cracks riddle the passage, though even a halfling would find the largest of them a tight fit.": "天坑裂缝的尽头是一个由加工过的石头组成的平坦地板。灰尘、碎片、石头和曾经构成上面仓库的墙壁和天花板的木头碎片散布在地板上。南面的地下通道被封锁了，但它继续向北进入黑暗。两双人类大小的鞋印，在灰尘中很容易被发现，向北走。较小的裂缝、孔洞和裂纹在通道中随处可见，不过即使是半身人也会发现其中最大的裂缝也很难适应。",
	"The earthquake sealed many of the passages that once made up this underground maze. As the characters explore, they pass through worked tunnels, natural caverns, and functional sewers at different points. Most side passages are blocked by rubble, making the path of the two Waterdeep City Watch guards easy to follow.": "地震封住了许多曾经构成这个地下迷宫的通道。随着人物的探索，他们会在不同的地方通过工作通道、天然洞穴和功能性下水道。大多数侧面的通道都被瓦砾挡住了，使得两个水底城守卫的路径很容易被追踪。",

	"This rectangular chamber shows no earthquake damage, possibly because of the buttresses and columns supporting the walls and ceiling. Four pools of liquid are set into the floor—one blue, another green, a third clear, and the last cloudy. Carvings on the walls seemingly depict the pools, and show robed figures submerging themselves within. At the far end of the chamber stands a double door with a large, ornately carved lock.": "这个长方形的房间没有显示出地震的破坏，可能是因为有支撑墙壁和天花板的壁架和柱子。地板上有四个液体池，一个是蓝色的，一个是绿色的，一个是透明的，最后一个是浑浊的。墙壁上的雕刻似乎描绘了这些池子，并显示出穿着长袍的人在里面浸泡。在密室的远端矗立着一扇双扇门，门上有一个巨大的、华丽的雕刻的锁。",
	"The pools represent the trials the characters must undertake to pass the test of That-Which-Endures. Each pool is 10 feet deep and has sheer sides.

	"Opening the lock without the key requires a successful DC 17 Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|PHB}. Any unsuccessful attempt to pick the lock triggers a trap (see below). The door cannot be broken down or otherwise smashed, and attempting to do so triggers the trap.": "在没有钥匙的情况下打开锁需要使用{@item thieves' tools|PHB}的DC17灵巧检查成功。任何不成功的撬锁尝试都会触发一个陷阱（见下文）。这扇门不能被打破或以其他方式打碎，试图这样做会触发陷阱。",
	"A character fully submerged in the blue pool must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw as images of horror overwhelm their mind. On a failure, the character has visions of terrible calamities such as rotting flesh, crumbling edifices, and political speeches. This trauma imposes disadvantage on initiative rolls. On a successful save, these visions put the character on edge, granting advantage on initiative rolls. Either effect lasts until the end of the character's next long rest.": "一个完全浸泡在蓝池中的角色必须做一个DC10的魅力储蓄，因为恐怖的图像会淹没他们的头脑。如果失败，这个角色就会看到可怕的灾难，比如腐烂的肉体、摇摇欲坠的建筑和政治演说。这种创伤使他们在主动性方面处于不利地位。如果救治成功，这些幻觉会使角色处于紧张状态，并在主动性卷轴上获得优势。这两种效果都会持续到角色的下一次长时间休息结束。",
	"A character fully submerged in this pool must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw as poison courses into their body.

Otherwise, the creature shambles around for 1 minute.": "在拯救失败的情况下，该生物不再是{@condition paralyzed}，而是被强迫与僵尸一起上升，并向门移动。被这种蛊惑抓住的角色与僵尸没有区别，尽管他们不会被迫攻击。受影响的生物可以在其每个回合结束时重复蓄力，如果成功则结束对自己的影响。否则，该生物将在周围晃动1分钟。",
	"An extensive tunnel system beyond the trap room does not appear on the map. This area is a complex maze of passages crisscrossing each other, collapsed tunnels forcing the characters to take side passages, weak areas exposed by the earthquake and threatening to collapse, and so on. To successfully navigate this area, the characters must tread carefully, look for signs of previous passage and structural weakness, dodge falling rocks, and use their wits.": "陷阱室之外的一个广泛的隧道系统并没有出现在地图上。这个区域是一个复杂的迷宫，通道纵横交错，坍塌的隧道迫使人物走侧面的通道，地震暴露出的薄弱区域有可能坍塌，等等。为了成功地浏览这个区域，人物必须小心翼翼地行走，寻找以前的通道和结构薄弱的迹象，躲避掉下来的石头，并运用他们的智慧。",
	"The characters' first task is to stay on the trail left by Sergeant Teeshe and Constable Boot. Doing so requires one character to succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check. On a successful check, the characters remain safely on the trail. On a failed check, they veer off the trail at one point into an unsafe passage weakened by the earthquake. Each character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 4 ({@dice 1d8}) bludgeoning damage from falling rocks.": "角色们的第一个任务是沿着Teeshe警长和Boot警员留下的线索前进。这样做需要一个角色在DC10智慧({@skill Survival})检查中取得成功。如果检查成功，人物就会安全地留在小路上。如果检查失败，他们就会偏离小路，进入一个被地震削弱的不安全通道。每个角色必须在DC 10的灵巧救赎中成功，否则就会受到落石的4({@dice 1d8})重击伤害。",

	"When Caerhan Coalsmith ventured into these caverns, his goblin sidekick Gorkoh (N male {@creature goblin}) came with him. Caerhan and the other members of his adventuring party had spared Gorkoh's life a few months back when they cleared out a temple to Maglubiyet, the chief of the goblin gods. Caerhan saw potential for the goblin to become a productive member of society, so he became a friend and mentor to Gorkoh, and encouraged him to learn about magic. Caerhan has also encouraged Gorkoh to expand his Common vocabulary, with inconsistent results.": "当Caerhan Coalsmith冒险进入这些洞穴时，他的地精伙伴Gorkoh（N男{@creature goblin}）与他同行。几个月前，凯尔汉和他的冒险队伍的其他成员在清理地精之神马格鲁比耶特的神庙时，饶了戈尔科的命。Caerhan看到了这个地精成为社会上有生产力的成员的潜力，所以他成为了Gorkoh的朋友和导师，并鼓励他学习魔法知识。Caerhan还鼓励Gorkoh扩大他的普通话词汇量，但结果并不一致。",
	"Since becoming separated from Caerhan during a carrion crawler attack, Gorkoh has hidden here waiting for his mentor to return.

	"The passage widens into a natural cavern dotted with stalactites and stalagmites. It continues on to the northeast, but the uneven walls make it hard to see into that section—even as heap of bones and gear is plainly visible.": "通道变宽，进入一个天然洞穴，里面点缀着钟乳石和石笋。它继续向东北方向延伸，但不平整的墙壁使人很难看到那部分--甚至可以清楚地看到一堆骨头和装备。",
	"The goblin emerges from behind a stalagmite and brandishes a gnarled piece of bleached wood. \"I am a powerful wizard. My wand annihilates all those who make me uptight. Go away. Leave Gorkoh alone, and there's no annihilate.

If anyone makes even the slightest effort to reassure Gorkoh that they have no plans to hurt him, the goblin relaxes.": "Gorkoh继续虚张声势，假装他那根磨光了的浮木的虬枝是一根魔杖。通过DC10智慧({@skill Insight})检查成功的角色可以看出Gorkoh在虚张声势。如果检定成功5个或更多，该角色可以直觉到Gorkoh很害怕。如果有人稍稍努力向Gorkoh保证他们没有伤害他的计划，这个妖精就会放松。",
	"If the characters engage Gorkoh in conversation, he tells of how he and Caerhan came to these caverns in search of a lost shrine, and how Caerhan's goal was to destroy some old magic relic. Regarding the relic, Gorkoh knows only that it's \"some broken clock thing,\" and that it was responsible for killing the other members of Caerhan's party. He tells of how the two became separated during a carrion crawler attack in the cavern just beyond this one. Caerhan must have escaped deeper into the tunnels, but Gorkoh wasn't willing to risk facing the monster to follow.": "如果人物与Gorkoh对话，他就会讲述他和Caerhan是如何来到这些洞穴寻找失落的神殿的，以及Caerhan的目标是如何摧毁一些古老的魔法遗迹。关于这个遗迹，Gorkoh只知道它是 \"一个坏掉的钟\"，而且它要对杀死Caerhan一行的其他成员负责。他讲述了两人是如何在这个洞穴之外的腐尸爬行者袭击中走散的。凯尔汉一定是逃到了隧道的深处，但高克不愿意冒着面对怪物的风险去追赶。",
	"If on friendly terms with the characters (or if he needs to offer up information to save his skin), Gorkoh can offer advice on the best way to deal with the carrion crawler, pointing out a fragile and sharp stalactite cluster at a narrow point leading into the next cavern. If the characters lure the creature under the cluster, they might be able to think of some way to drop the sharp rocks on the crawler.": "如果与角色关系友好（或者他需要提供信息以保全自己），Gorkoh可以就对付腐肉爬虫的最佳方法提供建议，指出在通往下一个洞穴的狭窄处有一个脆弱而尖锐的钟乳石群。如果角色们把怪物引到钟乳石群下，他们也许能想出一些办法，把锋利的石头扔到爬行者身上。",
	"If the characters try to hurt or intimidate Gorkoh, he attempts to send them into the carrion crawler's domain unprepared, hoping that the monster takes care of them.": "如果角色试图伤害或恐吓Gorkoh，他就会试图在毫无准备的情况下将他们送入腐肉爬行者的领域，希望怪物能解决他们。",
	"Provided the characters treat Gorkoh well, he's willing to serve the group as a hireling. In return for food and lodging, he becomes a reliable and enterprising employee.": "只要角色们善待高尔基，他就愿意作为雇工为组织服务。作为食宿的回报，他成为一个可靠的、有进取心的雇员。",
	"On the other hand, if the characters mistreat him or regularly put him in danger, Gorkoh abandons them. If that happens, another goblin named Splugoth the Returned approaches Gorkoh with alternative employment.

Alternatively, a character who places their own bare foot on the wall inside the rune-marked footprint automatically succeeds at deactivating those runes. Deactivating both footprints halts the Big Foot's attacks.": "南北墙上的符文脚印为大脚怪的魔法提供了动力。一个角色可以解除符文的魔力，只要站在脚印的5英尺范围内，用一个动作在DC12智力（{@skill Arcana}或{@skill Religion}）检查中成功。另外，如果一个角色将自己的赤脚放在有符文标记的脚印内的墙壁上，就会自动成功解除这些符文。停用两个脚印可以停止大脚怪的攻击。",
	"A murderer in Waterdeep has been killing people, taking their feet, and placing them on an altar hidden in the city as a sacrifice to That-Which-Endures.

By placing clues on the feet that lead to the murderer, you can create a side trek mystery for the characters. You can also have two more feet suddenly appear in midair near the ceiling, then drop into the room as the adventurers fight. Before diving headlong into the events of \"The Orrery of the Wanderer\" campaign, you might wish to spend some time having the characters experience and explore the city of Waterdeep.

	"A small, brass-colored dragon thrashes madly at the far end of the cavern, trapped beneath two large boulders that block a northern tunnel. Two dark creatures resembling flying squids dart just out of the little dragon's reach, harassing it. Another northern tunnel is also blocked with rubble. Only a tunnel to the east stands clear of debris.": "一条黄铜色的小龙在洞穴的远端疯狂地跳动，它被困在两块大石下面，这两块大石堵住了北面的通道。两只类似飞天鱿鱼的黑暗生物在小龙触手可及的地方飞奔，骚扰着它。另一条北面的隧道也被碎石堵住了。只有东边的一条隧道没有碎石。",
	"The two {@creature Darkmantle||darkmantles} understand that the dragon is doomed to eventually die of its wounds, and that they can have an easy meal in a few hours if they bide their time. They are thus staying out of the dragon's reach.

She can also confirm that she saw an armed and armored female human—Sergeant Ava Teeshe—pass through this chamber and head east some hours ago. Dabshabah kept silent, fearing the human would slay her.": "达布沙巴还不到一岁，她讲述了一条绿龙如何袭击她和她的兄弟姐妹，把她从母亲的领地赶到剑海岸的故事。她还可以证实，她看到一个武装和装甲的女性人类--艾娃-提舍中士--在几个小时前穿过这个房间，向东走去。达布沙巴保持沉默，担心这个人类会杀了她。",

	"Waterdeep is protected by a magical ward that keeps dragons from entering the city. The ward doesn't reach this far below ground, so Dabshabah is safe here. However, if the characters attempt to bring her out of the fissure, she can't follow them. The dragon whines and sobs when it becomes clear that the characters must leave her behind. Arranging to meet somewhere outside the city quiets her, but Dabshabah demands assurances that the party won't abandon her.": "沃特德普受到一个魔法阵的保护，使龙无法进入城市。这个魔法阵并没有到达地下这么远，所以达布沙巴在这里是安全的。然而，如果角色们试图把她带出裂缝，她就不能跟着他们。当角色们清楚地知道必须把她留下时，这条龙就会呜呜地哭起来。安排在城外的某个地方见面使她安静下来，但达布沙巴要求保证党不会抛弃她。",
	"It might be fun to run Dabshabah as an NPC member of the party for a bit. However, any dragon—even a chaotic good wyrmling—can be tough to manage. Townsfolk are likely to be terrified at the prospect of a dragon coming into their shops and taverns. Moreover, caring for Dabshabah to her own high standards, including meeting her needs for sustenance and treasure, is equivalent to maintaining a character in a wealthy lifestyle.": "将达布沙巴作为党内的一个NPC成员来管理可能会很有趣。然而，任何龙--即使是混乱的好巫妖--都很难管理。镇民们可能会因为一条龙进入他们的商店和酒馆而感到害怕。此外，按照她自己的高标准照顾达布沙巴，包括满足她对食物和财宝的需求，相当于维持一个角色的富裕生活。",
	"That said, having Dabshabah stay with the party for a short time, then take off on her own to learn the business of being a dragon, could provide a bit of poignant narrative in your campaign. Much later on, if the characters are ever facing long odds in an important battle, Dabshabah might swoop down from the sky to return the favor the heroes once did for her.": "也就是说，让Dabshabah和队伍呆上一小段时间，然后自己去学习做龙的事情，可以在你的战役中提供一点凄美的叙述。以后，如果角色们在一场重要的战斗中面临巨大的困难，达布沙巴可能会从空中俯冲下来，以回报英雄们曾经对她的帮助。",

Splayed on the ground next to the device is the corpse of a dwarf.": "这个破败的密室被一个靠着远处墙壁的祭坛所支配，上面悬挂着某种结构性的齿轮装置，最后形成一个巨大的大锤。祭坛左侧的墙壁已经倒塌，碎石遍布地板。祭坛附近的地板上有一个金色的装置，类似于一个圆形的外壳。这个装置被撞得七零八落，露出了暴露的齿轮和辐条，其外表的碎片和镀层散落在地板上。在装置旁边的地面上，躺着一具矮人的尸体。",
	"In the southwest corner of the room stands a muscular female human dressed in the livery of the Waterdeep City Watch. Her eyes are closed, and she breathes deeply as though resting.": "在房间的西南角，站着一个肌肉发达的女性人类，穿着沃特迪普城市守卫的制服。她闭着眼睛，深呼吸，似乎在休息。",
	"Teeshe touched the altar when she first entered this area, and a spirit loyal to That-Which-Endures possessed her (see below). If the adventurers touch or disturb anything in this chamber (including the altar, the gearwork maul, or Teeshe herself), the spirit controlling Sergeant Teeshe forces her to attack. Use the {@creature thug} stat block for her in this state.": "蒂舍在第一次进入这个区域时触碰了祭坛，一个忠于That-Which-Endures的灵魂附身于她（见下文）。如果冒险者触碰或打扰这个密室中的任何东西（包括祭坛、齿轮加工锤或蒂谢本人），控制蒂谢中士的灵魂会迫使她进行攻击。在这种状态下，对她使用{@creature thug}的状态块。",
	"The gearwork device above the altar is called an entropy guardian, and it animates 1 round after Teeshe attacks. The entropy guardian's expanding clockwork arms allow it to attack anywhere in the room, but it cannot attack beyond it. On initiative count 10, it makes two attacks per round: +4 to hit, 7 ({@dice 1d8 + 2}) bludgeoning damage. The damaged entropy guardian is a Huge object with AC 18, 32 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It focuses its attacks on intruders within 5 feet of the altar, anyone fighting with Sergeant Teeshe, and anyone holding the orrery housing (which its magic recognizes as an ongoing threat).": "祭坛上方的齿轮装置被称为 \"熵守护者\"，它在提舍攻击后的1个回合内会产生动画。熵守卫者膨胀的发条臂使它可以攻击房间里的任何地方，但它不能攻击房间以外的地方。在主动权计数为10时，它每回合进行两次攻击。命中率+4，7({@dice 1d8 + 2})重击伤害。受损的熵守护者是一个巨大的物体，AC值为18，命中率为32，对毒药和精神伤害有免疫力。它的攻击重点是在祭坛5英尺范围内的入侵者，任何与特谢中士战斗的人，以及任何持有兽皮箱的人（它的魔法将其识别为持续的威胁）。",
	"The altar is made of granite and covered in runes. It accepts offerings by destroying them with the attacks of the entropy guardian, representing the entropic power of That-Which-Endures. However, the ancient altar malfunctioned when Caerhan set the orrery housing on it—or perhaps the orrery channeled its own powerful magic to destroy the altar in self-defense. Either way, that pulse of power caused the earthquake, and saw the entropy guardian slay the unfortunate Caerhan when it took him as a threat to the shrine.": "祭坛由花岗岩制成，上面布满了符文。它接受祭品的方式是用熵的守护者的攻击来摧毁它们，代表着 \"那个-那个-结束 \"的熵的力量。然而，当卡伊尔汗在祭坛上设置了口器外壳时，古老的祭坛出现了故障--或者也许是口器引导它自己强大的魔法来摧毁祭坛以进行自我防御。不管怎么说，那股力量的脉冲引起了地震，并且看到熵的守护者把不幸的凯尔汉当成了对神殿的威胁而杀死了他。",
	"If a character tries to identify the runes on the altar, a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Religion}) check determines only that they are connected to no known deity, but that their symbology associates them with the power of destruction and ruin. The magic of the altar and the gearwork maul is faltering, but would once have been capable of destroying even powerful magic items.": "如果一个角色试图识别祭坛上的符文，成功通过DC15智力（{@skill Arcana}或{@skill Religion}）检查，就能确定它们与任何已知的神灵有关，但它们的符号学将它们与破坏和毁灭的力量联系起来。祭坛和齿轮锤的魔力正在减弱，但曾经有能力摧毁强大的魔法物品。",
	"The {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} is a powerful magic artifact, detailed in {@book appendix D|AI|6}. In its present state, the orrery has been battered by the entropy guardian, though its six-sided form remains intact. Its side plating is mostly missing, but can be collected from the floor nearby. If characters replace any of the shattered side plating, it magically reattaches itself. More oddly, if the characters don't replace the plating, it begins to regrow, even as the orrery housing magically straightens itself out.": "{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}是一件强大的魔法神器，详见{@book appendix D|AI|6}。在其目前的状态下，这口塔已经被熵的守护者击打过了，尽管它的六面体仍然完好。它的侧板大部分都不见了，但可以从附近的地板上收集。如果人物替换了任何一块破碎的侧板，它就会神奇地重新连接起来。更奇怪的是，如果人物不更换镀层，它就会开始重新生长，甚至是像铁匠铺一样神奇地恢复了原状。",
	"Within a few days, the orrery housing is a pristine, golden six-sided device with a circular hole in each face. The setup of gears and attachments within the orrery makes it clear that six round components are meant to be placed into the device. Characters will not recall seeing any such devices in the shrine of destruction.": "几天之内，口轮外壳是一个原始的、金色的六面装置，每个面都有一个圆孔。箭塔内的齿轮和附件的设置清楚地表明，六个圆形的部件是要放入这个装置的。人物不会记得在毁灭神殿中看到过任何这样的装置。",
	"With Sergeant Teeshe saved (or with her body in tow and a convenient cover story), the characters can make their way back to the sinkhole. If they left any dangers behind them on their initial pass, those dangers reemerge on the trip back—and will prevent them from fulfilling their contract if not eliminated.": "在救出特谢中士后（或拖着她的尸体和一个方便的掩护故事），角色们可以回到天坑的路上。如果他们在最初的旅程中留下了任何危险，这些危险就会在回去的路上重新出现--如果不消除这些危险，他们就无法履行合同。",
	"When the characters climb out of the sinkhole, Captain Truff is waiting for them alone, and is pleased to see them. She's even more pleased if the characters rescued Sergeant Teeshe. Truff asks the characters to sign an affidavit confirming that they've completely investigated and cleared the passages beyond the fissure. If the characters lie about the success of their mission, they risk a fine, imprisonment, or both.": "当人物爬出天坑时，特鲁夫船长正独自等待他们，看到他们很高兴。如果角色们救出了Teeshe警长，她会更加高兴。特鲁夫要求他们签署一份宣誓书，确认他们已经完全调查并清理了裂缝之外的通道。如果他们在任务成功的问题上撒谎，就有可能被罚款、监禁，或者两者兼而有之。",
	"The characters must also agree to have all the goods they found beneath the city inventoried. If anyone later claims to be the rightful owner of any of the loot, a magistrate might rule that the goods belong to the original owner instead of the characters. Who knew adventuring required so much paperwork?": "角色们还必须同意将他们在城市下面发现的所有货物清点出来。如果后来有人声称自己是任何战利品的合法主人，地方法官可能会裁定这些货物属于原主人而不是人物。谁知道冒险需要这么多文书工作？",
	"Captain Truff fights alongside the characters, as do Gorkoh and Sergeant Teeshe if the characters rescued them. Otis Adalgrim might show up too, either during or after the fight.": "特鲁夫船长与角色们并肩作战，如果角色们救了他们，戈尔科和提舍中士也会出现。奥蒂斯-阿达格雷姆（Otis Adalgrim）也可能出现，在战斗中或战斗后出现。",
	"With this first episode completed, the characters attain 2nd level! But even as they get to bask in the warm glow of that achievement, they must return to Acquisitions Incorporated to report. Omin Dran is there to meet with them when they do. If the characters were successful and dealt with Captain Truff in good faith, Omin gives them the promised reward of 400 gp for the group (500 gp minus the Acquisitions Incorporated fee). If the characters were only partly successful, adjust Omin's reaction and what follows as necessary.": "随着第一集的完成，角色们达到了第二级！但即使他们可以享受到这一成就的温暖光芒，他们也必须回到收购公司报告。但是，当他们沉浸在这一成就的温暖光芒中时，他们必须回到收购公司报告。当他们返回时，奥明-德兰将在那里与他们会面。如果他们成功了，并且真诚地与Truff船长打交道，Omin会给他们承诺的400gp的奖励（500gp减去收购公司的费用）。如果人物只是部分成功，请根据需要调整奥明的反应和接下来的内容。",
	"Having since learned about the initial mistaken identity when he met the characters, Omin is even more impressed by their success. Or he might be in the mood to demand favors from them if things didn't go entirely as planned (because that kind of mess makes the whole company look bad). Either way, read:": "自从了解了最初遇到人物时的错误身份后，奥明对他们的成功更加印象深刻。或者，如果事情没有完全按计划进行，他可能有心情向他们索要好处（因为那种混乱让整个公司看起来很糟糕）。无论怎样，请阅读。",
	"\"I've been told about the misunderstanding regarding your identities. I can't say much for your relative inexperience and lack of skill. But it looks as though you've got enough moxie to cover for that. And a willingness to do what it takes to get ahead.

	"Omin pulls a map from a satchel and places it on the conference room's oak table. \"You know the town of Phandalin? Just off the Triboar Trail? A few months back, we awarded a group a franchise there. We received word that they were taking control of some ruined estate for their headquarters, and everything seemed to be going well. Only they missed this month's franchise payment, and their secretarian isn't answering any calls.\"": "奥明从一个挎包里掏出一张地图，放在会议室的橡木桌上。\"你知道范达林镇吗？就在Triboar Trail附近？几个月前，我们授予一个团体在那里的特许权。我们收到消息，他们正在控制一些被毁坏的房产作为他们的总部，一切似乎都很顺利。只是他们错过了这个月的加盟费，而且他们的秘书也不接任何电话。\"",
	"Omin snaps his fingers, and a paper, a pen, and an ink pot leap from his satchel. \"This note gives you the right to travel to Phandalin and investigate the franchise there on my behalf. If you find the franchise in poor standing or otherwise in distress, I want a full report. And depending on how badly the last group botched things, I might look to you to take over. A failed franchise makes the whole company look bad. I'm sure you understand.\"": "奥明打了个响指，一张纸、一支笔和一个墨水罐从他的挎包里跃出。\"这张纸条让你有权前往范达林，代表我调查那里的特许权。如果你发现专营权状况不佳或有其他困难，我要一份完整的报告。根据上一批人把事情搞砸的程度，我可能会找你来接管。一个失败的特许经营权使整个公司看起来很糟糕。我相信你能理解。\"",
	"Omin then levels a hard stare. \"I want you to appreciate what an incredible opportunity this is for you. You're skipping countless steps in the normal franchise process. No internships. No tests. It's unheard of. But I believe in you.\"": "奥明然后狠狠地瞪了一眼。\"我想让你明白这对你来说是一个多么不可思议的机会。你跳过了正常特许经营过程中的无数个步骤。没有实习期。没有测试。这是闻所未闻的。但我相信你。\"",
	"As before, Omin Dran is a busy CEO, and doesn't have time for a lot of questions. If the characters discuss finding the mysterious orrery housing, he tells them to make researching the relic part of their mission. With the characters all newly minted, official Acquisitions Incorporated employees, Omin trusts that they'll know what to do.": "和以前一样，奥明德兰是个忙碌的CEO，没有时间回答很多问题。如果角色们讨论寻找神秘的ORRERY住房，他就告诉他们把研究遗迹作为他们任务的一部分。由于这些人物都是新晋的收购公司正式员工，奥明相信他们会知道该怎么做。",
	"Once the characters formally establish their franchise at the end of episode 2, downtime activities and franchise tasks will play a bigger role in the adventure. For now, though, encouraging the players to engage in downtime activities before heading off for Phandalin can help them get comfortable with the idea of dedicating nonadventuring time to personal and business development.": "一旦人物在第二集末尾正式建立起他们的特许经营权，停工活动和特许经营任务将在冒险中发挥更大的作用。不过现在，在前往范达林之前，鼓励玩家参与停工活动可以帮助他们适应将非冒险时间用于个人和商业发展的想法。",
	"A few possible downtime activities are suggested below, but the party's downtime escapades can include anything that you and the players come up with.": "以下是一些可能的休息时间活动的建议，但聚会的休息时间可以包括你和玩家想出的任何东西。",
	"Characters interested in the strange altar under Waterdeep can undertake research to study its mysterious runes, which can lead to information regarding That-Which-Endures (see the sidebar in the \"{@book New Race: Verdan|AI|2|New Race: Verdan}\" section in chapter 3.) Gorkoh the goblin might assist with this task if the characters keep him around, as a kind of warm-up for the rules for letting NPCs run franchise tasks (which the characters will gain access to at the end of episode 2).": "对沃特迪普地下的奇怪祭坛感兴趣的角色可以进行研究，以研究其神秘的符文，这可能会导致有关That-Which-Endures的信息（见第三章中\"{@book New Race: Verdan|AI|2|New Race: Verdan} \"部分的侧边栏）。如果角色把他留在身边，地精Gorkoh可能会协助完成这项任务，作为让NPC执行特许任务的规则的一种热身（角色将在第二集末尾获得访问权）。",
	"In episode 2, Omin Dran sends the adventurers (now 2nd level) to Phandalin to learn the fate of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise that opened there a few months earlier but has recently gone dark. After overcoming hazards on the road, the characters enter the town. There, they learn that the franchise had signed an agreement to purchase the oft-ruined Tresendar Manor, a small estate on the outskirts of town. However, something catastrophic occurred at the manor recently, and no one in town has seen any of the occupants since.": "在第二集里，Omin Dran派冒险者（现在是第二级）到Phandalin去了解几个月前在那里开的收购公司专营店的命运，但最近已经黑了。在克服了路上的危险之后，人物进入了小镇。在那里，他们了解到该特许经营权已经签署了一份协议，以购买经常被破坏的特伦达庄园，一个位于镇郊的小庄园。然而，最近庄园里发生了一些灾难性的事情，从那以后，镇上的人都没有见过任何住户。",
	"While in Phandalin, the adventurers have the opportunity to interact with the townsfolk, possibly becoming involved in small-town dramas—including a mayoral election. Those events could have a significant impact on the franchise the characters will establish at the end of this episode.": "在范达林，冒险家们有机会与乡亲们互动，可能会卷入小镇的剧情--包括市长选举。这些事件可能会对人物在本集结束时建立的特许经营权产生重大影响。",
	"After dealing with the threats in the dungeon, the characters run into operatives from Dran Enterprises who have been sent to take control of the site. With the imminent dangers in and around Phandalin neutralized, the characters are rewarded by Head Office with the license to take over the failed Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. From there, they are set to investigate who was behind the attack on Acq Inc, and what connection the mysterious orrery might have to this new threat.": "在处理完地牢里的威胁后，这些角色遇到了德兰企业的特工，他们被派来控制这个地方。随着范达林及其周围的危险被解除，这些角色得到了总部的奖励，获得了接管失败的收购公司特许权的许可。在那里，他们被安排调查谁是攻击Acq公司的幕后黑手，以及神秘的矿石与这个新的威胁有什么联系。",
	"The appearance of Dran Enterprises at the end of this episode is meant very much to imply that the organization was involved in the attack—and to distract the characters and the players alike from speculating on what other nefarious operators might be involved. The plots of the Six are revealed over the course of the adventure. More information on the Six, Splugoth, and Dran Enterprises can be found in \"{@book Factions and Rivals|AI|2|Factions and Rivals}\" in {@book chapter 3|AI|2}, and in {@book appendix B|AI|4}.": "在这一集的结尾，德兰企业的出现在很大程度上是为了暗示该组织参与了这次袭击，并分散人物和玩家的注意力，让他们不去猜测还有哪些邪恶的经营者可能参与其中。在冒险过程中，六人帮的阴谋将被揭露。关于六人帮、Splugoth和Dran企业的更多信息可以在{@book chapter 3|AI|2}的\"{@book Factions and Rivals|AI|2|Factions and Rivals} \"和{@book appendix B|AI|4}中找到。",
	"The trek from Waterdeep to Phandalin requires the adventurers to travel north on the High Road, then head east along the Triboar Trail before taking the track south into town.

	"This first part of the episode features three encounters covering the journey from Waterdeep to Phandalin, all of which offer connections to the rest of the adventure. If you want your campaign to move at a quick pace, run only these encounters. In doing so, you don't have to worry about random encounters and setting up details of the journey such as who keeps watch when the characters camp.": "这一集的第一部分有三个奇遇，涵盖了从沃特迪普到潘达林的旅程，所有这些奇遇都提供了与冒险的其他部分的联系。如果你想让你的活动以快速的速度进行，就只进行这些遭遇战。这样一来，你就不必担心随机遭遇和设置旅途中的细节，如人物扎营时由谁看守。",
	"If you prefer to emphasize the dangerous nature of the adventuring life for lower-level characters, random encounters can be used to create additional tension along the road. As characters gain levels and access to diverse powers, random wilderness encounters become less of a threat, so this is a great point in the campaign to use random encounters to challenge the party.": "如果你喜欢强调低级别的角色的冒险生活的危险性，可以用随机遭遇来创造沿途的额外紧张。随着角色等级的提高和获得不同的力量，随机的野外遭遇变得不那么具有威胁性，所以这是活动中使用随机遭遇来挑战队伍的一个好时机。",

	"Kofutacti, a {@creature young green dragon}, is touring the Sword Coast looking for trouble (see the \"{@area Life in Waterdeep|00b|x}\" sidebar in episode 1). Thankfully for the characters, the dragon is a cowardly sort that prefers intimidation to combat, and which backs away from most fights. Kofutacti is the dragon who hunted Dabshabah in episode 1, which could be interesting if the brass wyrmling is with the party, or if the green dragon catches her scent on one of the characters if they've been in recent contact with her.": "Kofutacti，一只{@creature young green dragon}，正在剑海岸巡视，寻找麻烦（见第一集的\"{@area Life in Waterdeep|00b|x} \"侧边栏）。值得庆幸的是，这条龙是个胆小的家伙，喜欢恐吓而不是战斗，在大多数战斗中都会退缩。Kofutacti是第一集里猎杀Dabshabah的那条龙，如果黄铜女妖和队伍在一起，或者如果绿龙在某个角色身上捕捉到她的气味，如果他们最近和她有过接触，这可能会很有趣。",
	"As the party skirts the Mere of Dead Men on the High Road, they come across a lizardfolk being intimidated and harassed by an unscrupulous Zhentarim merchant and his bodyguards.": "当一行人绕过公路上的死人谷时，他们遇到了一个蜥蜴人，被一个无耻的赞塔林商人和他的保镖恐吓和骚扰。",
	"This part of the High Road runs parallel to the Mere of Dead Men, a swamp full of dangers, pestilence, and death.

	"The human shouts loudly enough for you to hear. \"Not acceptable! Friends, show this walking fish my displeasure.\"": "人类大声地喊叫，足以让你听到。\"不能接受! 朋友们，向这只步行鱼表示我的不悦。\"",
	"The lizardfolk starts to argue, saying, \"I am not a fish. I am—\" But the bugbears interrupt with the hafts of their weapons, knocking the wind out of the lizardfolk and driving it to its knees. The poor creature catches sight of your party, looking at all of you with a pleading expression.": "蜥蜴人开始争论，说：\"我不是鱼。但虫族用他们的武器打断了它，把蜥蜴人的风吹走了，把它逼得跪了下来。这个可怜的生物看到了你们一行人，用恳求的表情看着你们所有人。",
	"If the characters attempt to involve themselves in the altercation, Rasqel rudely orders them to go do things that are possible only during one of the less-restrained services in a temple of Loviatar.

They obey reluctantly, but if it becomes clear that their lives are in danger at any point, or if the characters offer 10 gp or more to each of them, they walk away and leave their boss to his fate. Rasqel, who is indebted to bad people, fights to the death. If the situation looks grim for the adventurers, Thetsis enters the fray.": "如果角色们在第二次警告后拒绝退缩，Rasqel就会命令虫子们进攻，而他则退缩。他们不情愿地服从，但如果他们的生命显然在任何时候都有危险，或者如果人物向他们每个人提供10戈比或更多，他们就走开，让他们的老板听天由命。负债累累的拉斯凯尔，会拼死一搏。如果情况看起来对冒险者来说很严峻，特西斯就会进入战场。",
	"The bugbears carry nothing of value, as Rasqel has not paid them in several days. The bandit carries 25 gp in his belt pouch.": "虫族没有携带任何有价值的东西，因为拉斯克尔已经好几天没有给他们钱了。匪徒的腰包里有25戈比。",
	"These kinds of side ventures can easily expand to become adventures of their own. For example, one of the franchise NPCs handling the algae trade might fail to return from the Mere of Dead Men one day. The characters need to find out what happened if they want to keep employee morale from tanking—and to keep the business relationship with the lizardfolk intact. Choices must be made and consequences faced, which are the hallmarks of a great campaign.": "这些副业可以很容易地扩展成自己的冒险。例如，处理海藻贸易的一个特许NPC可能有一天没有从死人谷回来。如果他们想保持员工的士气不受影响，并保持与蜥蜴人的业务关系不受影响，他们就需要找出发生了什么。必须做出选择并面对后果，这是一个伟大活动的标志。",

More importantly, any character with herbalist or alchemist experience realizes that the algae can be mixed with other reagents costing 150 gp to make a {@item potion of water breathing}. Such a potion might fetch up to 500 gp in a city such as Waterdeep or Neverwinter.": "角色们可能很容易认识到这种情况是一个主要的商业机会。如果没有，建议由一个有商人背景的角色来实现，或者由一个成功通过DC10智力（{@skill Nature}）或智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查的人实现。忒西丝携带的海藻，她愿意以50戈比的价格出售，但在水底世界价值100戈比。更重要的是，任何有草药师或炼金术士经验的人物都会意识到，这些海藻可以和其他价值150戈比的试剂混合，制成{@item potion of water breathing}。这样的药水在水底城或永夜城这样的城市可能会卖到500金币。",
	"After turning east from the High Road onto the Triboar Trail, the characters' travel slows a bit. The High Road is frequently traveled by caravans, and so is better kept and easier to traverse. Triboar Trail, on the other hand, sees less frequent traffic and is less well maintained.": "从大路向东转入特里波尔小道后，人物的旅行速度稍有放缓。高路经常有大篷车经过，所以维护得比较好，比较容易穿越。另一方面，Triboar Trail的交通不那么频繁，维护得也不那么好。",

He might be a beardless dwarf, or a short and pale half-orc, or a human with a gland condition. Either way, he doesn't look up as he speaks in a voice that sounds like a goat choking on sawdust.": "盘腿坐在路中央的是一个看起来很奇怪的人，他没有穿一针一线。他的一只手摆弄着一枚铜质奖章，上面刻着一对细长而纠结的鹿角的图案。他可能是一个没有胡子的侏儒，或者是一个矮小而苍白的半兽人，或者是一个有腺体疾病的人类。无论哪种情况，他都没有抬头，他说话的声音听起来像山羊被锯末噎住。",
	"\"Fortune has strange and wonderful and terrible things in store for you. So I am here as fortune's lackey. Fair or foul? Weal or woe? Chant or howl? Friend or foe?\"": "\"财富为你准备了奇怪的、美妙的和可怕的东西。所以我在这里作为财富的奴仆。公平还是邪恶？顺境还是逆境？吟唱还是嚎叫？朋友还是敌人？\"",

After an hour's travel, the characters come upon the following scene.": "当人物离开Triboar小道，进入到通往Phandalin的更少人使用的小道上时，他们偶然发现了一个看起来很普通的地精伏击，但却变成了更奇怪的事情。经过一个小时的旅行，人物来到了以下场景。",
	"Ahead on the rough road, a pair of dead horses and an overturned cart block your way. Sacks and barrels spilled from the cart litter the ground. Trees grow close to the road here, and the thick undergrowth obscures the view beyond.": "在前方崎岖的道路上，一对死马和一辆翻倒的马车挡住了你的去路。从车上洒落的麻袋和木桶散落在地上。这里的树木紧挨着道路，茂密的树丛遮住了前方的视野。",

	"If the characters poke around the rotting flesh that fell of the horses during the battle, they see that each horse bore scars on its sides that form the image of a draconic skull with a sword driven up through it from the bottom. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check recognizes the sigil as part of a unique necromantic ritual that can turn any creature into an undead creature when it dies.

	"Two people, both current councilors, are running for mayor. One is Harbin Wester, a male human with the integrity and unctuous personality of... well, a career politician. Wester is a former townmaster, and is running against Sildar Hallwinter, a male human, member of the Lords' Alliance, and former adventurer.

	"Wester is the town's banker and a major landowner, so some consider his wealth and power to be ample justification for his greedy, conniving nature. More importantly, a number of monstrous and magical incidents in the area over many years have left Phandalin's citizens anxious for strong-sounding leadership. Even though adventurers solved many of the town's problems in the past, Wester has gained much popularity by convincing people that the town's troubles would have never surfaced if those well-armed wandering busybodies hadn't gotten involved in the first place. The banker has even gone so far as to suggest that adventurers might have orchestrated some of Phandalin's past woes for their own gain.": "威斯特是镇上的银行家和大地主，所以有些人认为他的财富和权力是他贪婪、纵容的充分理由。更重要的是，多年来该地区发生的一些怪物和魔法事件，让范达林的市民们对强大的领导力感到焦虑。尽管过去冒险家们解决了该镇的许多问题，但韦斯特通过说服人们相信，如果那些全副武装的流浪忙人没有参与进来，该镇的麻烦就不会浮现，从而获得了很多人气。这位银行家甚至暗示，冒险家可能为了自己的利益而策划了范达林过去的一些困境。",
	"Sildar Hallwinter isn't a great orator. He spends most of his time refuting Wester's \"unsubstantiated claims.\" The retired warrior also points out that Phandalin needs a leader who knows the dangers of the wilderness, even as its people need a mayor unburdened by scandal and potential conflicts of interest.": "西尔达-霍尔温特并不是一个伟大的演说家。他大部分时间都在反驳韦斯特的 \"未经证实的说法\"。这位退役的战士还指出，范达林需要一个了解荒野危险的领导人，即使其人民需要一个没有丑闻和潜在利益冲突负担的市长。",

	"The Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise previously established in Phandalin. When that group arrived in town a few months ago, they spoke with Harbin Wester about acquiring the ruined Tresendar Manor, since the banker held the property's title.

When not slipping off to adventure for a few days here and there, most of their time was spent at the manor.": "金色独角兽的联谊会是之前在潘达林建立的收购公司专营权。几个月前，当该组织来到镇上时，他们与哈尔滨-维斯特谈起了收购被毁的特伦达庄园，因为银行家持有该房产的所有权。威斯特与总部制定了条款，交易被签署。特许经营权的成员很快就开始了修复庄园的工作，经常到镇上购买物资。在没有溜去冒险的时候，他们大部分时间都在庄园里度过。",
	"A number of days ago (the same day the franchise's payment was due to Head Office), the townsfolk heard explosions from the manor, with a few people reporting seeing gouts of flame and hearing the commotion of a battle. No one was really keen to investigate, wanting to avoid any trouble that the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose had brought on themselves. (Adventurers, right?) But after a few days passed and no one from the manor came into town, Sildar Hallwinter braved the walk up the hill to investigate.": "几天前（也就是特许经营权付款给总部的同一天），镇民们听到了来自庄园的爆炸声，有几个人报告说看到了火焰的喷发，听到了战斗的骚动。没有人真正热衷于调查，想避免金驼团契给自己带来的任何麻烦。(冒险家，对吗？)但几天过去了，庄园里没有人进城，西尔达-霍尔温特勇敢地走到山上去调查。",

	"Just over a year ago, operatives of the Six came across one of the components of the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}—the {@item far gear|AI}. Quickly realizing the potential power in the component and the orrery it was a part of, they began to scour the Sword Coast for information regarding the artifact. A month ago, their intelligence-gathering resources turned up word that two Acquisitions Incorporated franchises—including the newly minted Phandalin franchise—had been scrutineering for lore about mysterious magic clockwork devices. Wanting to determine what Acquisitions Incorporated might know about the orrery, the leaders of the Six put a plan into motion. (The second franchise was based on the Sword Coast between Neverwinter and Luskan. Its fate will be discovered by the characters in {@adventure episode 3|OoW|3}.)": "就在一年多以前，六人帮的成员发现了{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}的一个部件--{@item far gear|AI}。他们很快意识到这个部件和它所组成的轨道的潜在力量，开始在剑海岸搜寻有关这个神器的信息。一个月前，他们的情报收集资源发现了两个收购公司的特许权--包括新成立的潘达林特许权--一直在仔细研究关于神秘的魔法钟表装置的传说。为了确定收购公司可能知道的关于轨道的信息，六人组的领导人启动了一项计划。(第二个专营权是基于永夜和卢斯坎之间的剑海岸。它的命运将由{@adventure episode 3|OoW|3}中的人物来发现）。",
	"The Six set up an agent in Phandalin—Ditch Fundi, who first raised and now runs Phandalin's new Temple of the Coin Maiden. Using Ditch's intelligence on the activities of the Company of the Golden Mongoose, the Six confirmed that the franchise held an orrery component called the {@item timepiece of travel|AI}—and that Acq Inc head office was so far in the dark about their discovery. So the Six hired a number of agents—including archmage Hoobur Gran'Shoop—to attack both franchises.": "六人组在范达林设立了一个代理人--迪奇-芬迪，他首先提出并现在管理着范达林的新币女寺。利用迪奇关于金龟子公司活动的情报，六人组确认该特许经营权拥有一个名为{@item timepiece of travel|AI}的轨道组件--而Acq公司总部对他们的发现至今一无所知。因此，六人帮雇佣了一些特工--包括大法师胡伯-格兰肖普--来攻击这两家专营店。",
	"Only two of the townsfolk have any information regarding the attack on Tresendar Manor.

She knows no details of the attack, assuming that the Golden Mongoose adventurers either blew themselves up or summoned a monster they couldn't control. But she knows that Dran Enterprises is sending a team to clean up the mess and claim the manor.

As such, helping Wester get elected—or at least not being too obvious about opposing him—can put the characters on his good side. Even if Wester loses the election, his power and wealth mean that the characters will be interacting with him—and dealing with his ability to make their lives easier or harder—whether they want to or not.": "西尔达-霍尔温特关心本镇的利益，但却畏首畏尾。他缺乏魅力，损害了他的选举机会。但是，一群聪明的冒险家在幕后工作，可能正是霍尔温特需要的，以激发他的竞选。另一方面，哈尔滨-维斯特控制着潘达林的大部分财富，包括特伦达庄园。因此，帮助维斯特当选--或者至少不要太明显地反对他--可以让这些人物站在他的一边。即使维斯特在选举中失利，他的权力和财富也意味着人物将与他互动，并与他的能力打交道，使他们的生活变得更容易或更困难，无论他们是否愿意。",
	"Another possibility is that one of the characters could run for office as a last-minute wild-card candidate. A stranger wandering into Phandalin is unlikely to gain the trust of enough citizens to win the race, and the need to stick around town and run things will eventually get in the way of the characters venturing all over the North being heroic. But don't discount the narrative possibilities involved in the characters embracing the political side of the story even more wholeheartedly than you expect them to.": "另一种可能性是，其中一个角色可以作为最后一刻的野生候选人参加竞选。一个流浪到范达林的陌生人不太可能获得足够多的公民的信任来赢得竞选，而且坚持在镇上管理事情的需要最终会妨碍人物在北方各地冒险的英雄主义。但是，不要低估人物比你期望的更全心全意地拥抱政治方面所涉及的叙事可能性。",
	"Garaele was once an agent of the Harpers, though she has recently broken ties with that group of agents opposing the abuse of power. Since then, she has taken significant donations from Dran Enterprises, whose agents asked her to keep an eye on the members of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose and any other Acquisitions Incorporated operatives in Phandalin. Garaele is happy to pass this information along in exchange for Dran Enterprises' payments to the temple, and she asks no questions about that organization's long-term goals for the town. She is a good person, however, so she won't knowingly allow harm to befall others. She is helpful to anyone willing to offer wealth, goods, or services to her shrine.": "Garaele曾经是哈珀斯的一名特工，尽管她最近与那群反对滥用权力的特工断了联系。从那时起，她接受了德兰企业的大量捐赠，德兰企业的代理人要求她密切关注金驼团的成员和任何其他收购公司在潘达林的行动者。Garaele很乐意将这些信息传递出去，以换取德兰企业对寺庙的付款，而且她对该组织在该镇的长期目标不闻不问。不过，她是个好人，所以她不会故意让别人受到伤害。她对任何愿意为她的神殿提供财富、货物或服务的人都很有帮助。",
	"In the days since the destruction of the manor, farmers and herders on the outskirts of Phandalin have reported seeing giant-sized footprints, both humanoid and canine, as well as missing animals. No one has spotted Stuuzant, as the ogre has good instincts for avoiding trouble. She keeps moving, hiding until the time is right to strike. When she attacks livestock, she does so when no one can see her, and she takes only what she needs to survive.": "在庄园被毁后的几天里，范达林郊区的农民和牧民都报告说看到了巨大的脚印，包括人形和犬形的，还有失踪的动物。没有人发现Stuuzant，因为这个食人魔有避免麻烦的良好本能。她一直在移动，躲藏起来，直到时机成熟才出手。当她攻击牲畜时，她会在没有人看到她的时候进行，而且她只拿她需要的东西来生存。",
	"Characters might be asked to look into the missing livestock, or they can do so on their own to get on the good side of the locals. Investigating the disappearances might be used to angle for something the characters want or need, such as supplies, a lower price on Tresendar Manor, citizens favoring one mayoral candidate over another, or whatever else you can think of.": "角色可能被要求去调查失踪的牲畜，或者他们可以自己去调查，以获得当地人的好感。调查失踪事件可以用来争取人物想要或需要的东西，比如物资、特伦达庄园的低价、市民对某个市长候选人的偏爱，或者其他你能想到的东西。",
	"Tracking down and defeating Stuuzant is no easy task, however. She is friends with a pair of {@creature Dire Wolf||dire wolves}, and is mostly successful at covering her tracks after her raids. The ogre also has yet to establish a den in the area, so she rarely stays in one place for more than a day.": "然而，追踪并击败斯图赞特并不是一件容易的事。她和一对{@creature Dire Wolf||dire wolves}的朋友，在她的突袭之后，大多能成功地掩盖她的踪迹。这个食人魔还没有在这个地区建立起一个巢穴，所以她很少在一个地方停留超过一天的时间。",
	"If the characters locate her, Stuuzant speaks Common quite well, uses smarter tactics than a typical ogre, and tries to bargain with the characters if it looks like they might defeat her. If questioned, she tells the story of being hired to attack the manor. A goblin in hooded robes paid her to help break into the estate and smash everything in sight. Stuuzant never saw the goblin's face, and knows nothing about the Six (which was never mentioned to her or any of the other hirelings).": "如果角色们找到她，Stuuzant的普通话说得很好，使用比一般食人魔更聪明的战术，如果角色们看起来有可能打败她，她会试图与角色们讨价还价。如果被问起，她会讲述自己被雇佣来攻击庄园的故事。一个穿着连帽长袍的妖精付钱给她，让她帮助闯入庄园，打碎眼前的一切。斯图赞从未见过那个妖精的脸，也对六人组一无所知（她和其他雇工都没有提到过）。",
	"Savvy characters might convince Stuuzant to take a position in their franchise, with the ogre making a great sentry or bodyguard. However, the townspeople might need assurances to accept such a creature living so close to their town.": "精明的角色可能会说服Stuuzant在他们的特许经营中占据一席之地，让食人魔成为一个伟大的哨兵或保镖。然而，镇民们可能需要得到保证才能接受这样的生物离他们的小镇如此之近。",
	"Stuuzant carries the 50 gp she was paid to help attack the manor.": "斯图赞带着她得到的50金币，帮助攻击庄园。",
	"As they explore Phandalin—and eventually set up their franchise in the town—the characters can engage with many of the town's businesses, whether as patrons or potential partners. The most prominent of the town's locations (as well as a few additional NPCs) are detailed in this section. You can come up with details for additional locations and NPCs based on the needs and desires of your players.": "在探索范达林的过程中--最终在镇上建立了自己的特许经营权--人物可以与镇上的许多企业接触，无论是作为顾客还是潜在的合作伙伴。本节中详细介绍了该镇最突出的地点（以及一些额外的NPC）。你可以根据玩家的需要和愿望，为其他地点和NPC提供细节。",
	"The apple trees of Edermath Orchard surround a small group of buildings on the edge of town. The smell of fruit is strong around the orchard year round, with the apples grown and picked here processed throughout the winter into juice, cider, and other products.": "埃德马斯果园的苹果树围绕着城镇边缘的一小群建筑。果园周围一年四季都弥漫着浓浓的果香，这里种植和采摘的苹果在整个冬季都被加工成果汁、苹果酒和其他产品。",
	"Daran's half-elf daughter Bertice went missing the day before the destruction at Tresendar Manor, and he is beginning to fear for her. Most folk in town know that Bertice recently took up with a human miner named Grovet, who is also missing. If the characters met the couple on the road (see the \"{@area Random Encounters|07a|x}\" table earlier in this episode), they can allay at least some of Daran's fears for his daughter's safety.": "达兰的半精灵女儿贝尔蒂丝在特伦达庄园被毁的前一天失踪了，他开始为她担心。镇上的大多数人都知道贝尔蒂丝最近和一个叫格罗维特的人类矿工在一起，他也失踪了。如果人物在路上遇到这对夫妇（见本集前面的\"{@area Random Encounters|07a|x} \"表），他们至少可以减轻达兰对女儿安全的担忧。",
	"Earning Daran's full trust is a long-term proposition, and the characters must prove themselves beyond reproach in any dealings with the orchardist. If they do, however, the elf proves a valuable ally. He has more resources and power in town than his humble orchard might suggest. And as a member of the Order of the Gauntlet—an association of vigilant adventurers that seeks to overthrow evil—Edermath has the ear of powerful people up and down the Sword Coast.": "赢得达兰的完全信任是一个长期的命题，人物必须在与果园主的任何交易中证明自己无可指责。然而，如果他们做到了，这个精灵就会成为一个有价值的盟友。他在镇上拥有的资源和权力比他那简陋的果园所显示的要多。作为高塔骑士团的成员--一个由警觉的冒险家组成的协会，旨在推翻邪恶--埃德马斯拥有剑海岸上上下下有权势的人的耳朵。",
	"Most of the goods in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} can be purchased here. Linene can special order items for delivery in a few days (with a deposit, of course). However, she doesn't buy, procure, or sell morally questionable goods.": "{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的大部分商品都可以在这里购买。Linene可以特别订购商品，在几天内交货（当然要付定金）。然而，她不购买、采购或出售有道德问题的商品。",
	"This trading post once acted as the central hub for mining activity in the area, as well as the authority for maintaining public records. A two-story building, the exchange bears a newly painted sign depicting two crossed pickaxes above a lump of gold. The first story is where business is conducted, while the second story contains living quarters.": "这个贸易站曾经是该地区采矿活动的中心枢纽，也是维护公共记录的机构。这是一座两层楼的建筑，交易所上有一个新画的标志，上面描绘着两把交叉的镐头，上面是一坨金子。第一层是开展业务的地方，而第二层则是生活区。",
	"As with the Lionshield Coster, most of the goods available in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} can be purchased here. Mining gear is also easily had—as are illicit goods, with Sharna Quirstiron's dispensation (see \"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x}\").": "和狮盾成本中心一样，{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的大部分商品都可以在这里购买。采矿设备也很容易买到，非法商品也很容易买到，有莎尔娜-奎斯特隆的调剂（见\"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x}\"）。",
	"Until a month ago, this temple to Tymora was the only shrine in town. With the Temple of the Coinmaiden (see below) newly established, Sister Garaele, the local priestess, works harder each day to keep the attention of the faithful of Phandalin. See \"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x}\" for more information on Sister Garaele.": "直到一个月前，这座献给泰莫拉的神庙还是镇上唯一的神殿。随着硬币女郎神庙（见下文）的新成立，当地的女祭司Garaele修女每天都在努力工作，以保持范达林的信徒们的注意力。关于修女Garaele的更多信息，见\"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x}\"。",
	"This single-story tavern's better days have seen better days. Its weathered sign probably depicts a prone giant, but whatever paint or carvings once adorned the sign have been all but worn away. Inside, the place shows the same lack of care. It's dirty, ill kept, and in need of a thorough cleaning. Or burning.": "这家单层小酒馆的好日子已经过去了。其风化的招牌可能描绘了一个俯卧的巨人，但不管招牌上曾经装饰过什么油漆或雕刻，都已经被磨掉了。在内部，这个地方也显示出同样的缺乏关怀。它很脏，保管不善，需要彻底清洁。或者烧掉。",
	"The miners that frequent the Sleeping Giant are a rough lot, and could become a competent and formidable force if stirred up and pointed at a target. Currently, Sharna at the Miner's Exchange has their trust (see \"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x}\"), mostly for her assurances that the mines will soon be more prosperous than ever. If Sharna discovers that the characters are interfering with her and the Zhentarim's plans, she need only tell the miners that the characters are standing in the way of their gainful employment to inspire them to use their pickaxes for something other than mining. On the other hand, characters who earn the miners' good will can end up with numerous allies in Phandalin.": "经常光顾 \"沉睡的巨人 \"的矿工是一群粗野的人，如果他们被煽动起来并指向一个目标，就会成为一支有能力的、强大的力量。目前，矿工交易所的莎尔娜得到了他们的信任（见\"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x}\"），主要是因为她保证矿场很快会比以前更繁荣。如果莎尔娜发现这些角色干扰了她和Zhentarim的计划，她只需要告诉矿工，这些角色阻碍了他们有收益的工作，就可以激励他们用镐头做采矿以外的事情。另一方面，赢得矿工好感的角色最终会在范达林拥有众多盟友。",
	"Among the few people in town who are wary of Maza are those who question the nature of Alger's death—including a few malcontents who whisper that perhaps the young smith had a compelling reason to kill her master. Whether these rumors hold truth or are just the ramblings of a would-be ironworker who wants Maza's job is up to you.": "在镇上为数不多的对马扎保持警惕的人中，有一些人质疑阿尔杰之死的性质--包括一些心怀不满的人，他们低声说也许这个年轻的铁匠有令人信服的理由杀死她的主人。这些传言是真实的，还是只是一个想得到马扎工作的铁匠的胡言乱语，取决于你。",
	"The Stonehills are unwitting soldiers in the war for power in Phandalin. Although they own and operate their business, they owe a small amount of money to Harbin Wester. The banker wants to take their business, and he keeps an eye out for any opportunity to gain the necessary leverage. He might use the characters to lean on the Stonehills if they end up owing him favors. Alternatively, if the characters befriend the Stonehills, they might become staunch allies in the family's attempts to keep Wester's hands off their business.": "斯通希尔家族是范达林权力争夺战中不知情的士兵。虽然他们拥有并经营着自己的生意，但他们却欠着哈尔滨维斯特的一小笔钱。银行家想夺取他们的生意，他一直在留意任何可以获得必要筹码的机会。他可能会利用这些人物来靠拢Stonehills家族，如果他们最终欠他人情的话。另外，如果这些人物与斯通希尔家族交好，他们可能会成为该家族试图阻止韦斯特染指他们生意的坚定盟友。",
	"Many fantasy campaigns either ignore questions of law or utilize benevolent authoritarian figures to oversee social and economic justice—the wise monarch, the enlightened town council, the Masked Lords, and so forth. This method means that the law is stable. Higher authorities can be consulted on matters requiring arbitration, with concrete edicts handed down to make the line between right and wrong—in a civil sense, at least—crystal clear.": "许多幻想活动要么忽视法律问题，要么利用仁慈的专制人物来监督社会和经济的公正性--明智的君主、开明的镇议会、蒙面领主等等。这种方法意味着法律是稳定的。在需要仲裁的问题上，可以咨询更高的当局，通过具体的法令，使对与错之间的界限--至少在民事意义上--变得清晰。",
	"In Phandalin (as with many of the other locations in this adventure), the situation is not that simple. No king or council owns the lands of or around the town. Eminent domain is neither implied nor accepted. In most of the smaller settlements along the Sword Coast, the person with power is the individual who takes and holds that power. Locales still have authorities and laws, but the person who can kill everyone else—or pay someone to do so—is the one who truly rules.": "在潘达林（就像这次冒险中的许多其他地点一样），情况并不那么简单。没有国王或议会拥有该镇的或周围的土地。征用权既不隐含也不被接受。在剑海岸的大多数小型定居点中，拥有权力的人是采取并持有这种权力的个人。各地仍有当局和法律，但能杀死其他人的人--或付钱给别人这样做的人--才是真正的统治者。",
	"In Phandalin, Harbin Wester is that person. Even if he loses the mayoral election, his monetary resources far outstrip those of anyone else in the town, leaving him in a position of strong economic control. However, part of Wester's power derives from subtlety. He is wary enough to watch out for anyone with the ability to effectively oppose him, and savvy enough to make sure that such people never have any reason to oppose him. As such, when the characters clean out Tresendar Manor and attempt to use it as the base for their new franchise, a potential for social and economic conflict arises.": "在范达林，哈尔滨-维斯特就是这样的人。即使他在市长选举中失利，他的货币资源也远远超过了镇上的其他人，使他处于强大的经济控制地位。然而，韦斯特的权力部分来自于微妙的手段。他有足够的警惕性，注意任何有能力有效反对他的人，也有足够的智慧，确保这些人永远没有任何理由反对他。因此，当这些人物清理了特伦达庄园并试图将其作为新特许经营权的基地时，社会和经济冲突的可能性就产生了。",
	"Wester holds the mortgage on the manor. The legal entity that was the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was the signatory to that mortgage, and unfortunately for Acquisitions Incorporated, the mortgage is now in arrears. The characters can work a deal to take over those payments, but the terms are steep. Fortunately, after the manor is cleared, Head Office is willing to negotiate for the manor's deed. (See the \"{@area Conclusion|117|x}\" section of this episode for more information.) This leaves Harbin Wester bitter, as he recognizes that having the favor of Acq Inc backing them up gives the characters more potential power in Phandalin than he likes.": "维斯特持有该庄园的抵押权。金色独角兽团契的法律实体是该抵押贷款的签字人，不幸的是，对于收购公司来说，该抵押贷款现在已经拖欠了。角色们可以达成协议来接管这些款项，但条件很苛刻。幸运的是，在庄园被清空后，总部愿意为庄园的契约进行谈判。(详见本集的\"{@area Conclusion|117|x} \"部分）。这让哈尔滨威斯特苦不堪言，因为他认识到，有Acq公司的青睐为他们撑腰，让这些人物在范达林的潜在权力比他喜欢的更大。",
	"As the rest of the campaign plays out, keep track of how Wester might try to take advantage of the characters and their deal. What if operatives of Dran Enterprises or representatives of the Six come to him? More importantly, if the characters directly oppose Wester and bring him low, what happens if a worse power steps in to take his place? The options are limitless. Do what challenges and entertains your players most!": "在接下来的活动中，要注意韦斯特可能会如何利用这些人物和他们的交易。如果德兰企业的特工或六人帮的代表来找他怎么办？更重要的是，如果角色们直接反对维斯特，使他的地位下降，那么如果有更坏的势力介入，取代他的位置，会发生什么？选择是无限的。做到挑战和娱乐你的玩家最多!",
	"Half a year past, another general store in Phandalin called Barthen's Provisions went out of business. The building was purchased a month ago for the church of Waukeen by an unknown benefactor, and quickly renovated with all the fineries necessary to draw the attention of the goddess of wealth. The gnome Ditch Fundi oversaw the temple's construction and dedication, and she now runs it in Waukeen's name. (In truth, the benefactor who built the temple is the Six, and Ditch Fundi is their agent. See her entry in \"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x}\" for more information.)": "半年过去了，范达林的另一家名为 \"Barthen's Provisions \"的杂货店倒闭了。一个月前，一位不知名的施主为沃肯教堂买下了这座建筑，并迅速装修了所有必要的装饰品，以吸引财富女神的注意。地精迪奇-芬迪（Ditch Fundi）监督了寺庙的建造和奉献，她现在以沃肯的名义管理它。(事实上，建造寺庙的恩人是六人帮，而迪奇-芬迪是他们的代理人。更多信息见她在\"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x} \"中的条目）。",
	"This one-story hall is the closest thing the people of Phandalin have to a government building. Long used as the town council's meeting room and the townmaster's hall before that, it is set to be expanded to include the new mayor's office after the election. As the two remaining members of the town council, Sildar Hallwinter and Harbin Wester currently share office space here.": "这个一层楼的大厅是范达林人民最接近政府大楼的地方。长期以来，它被用作镇议会的会议室和之前的镇长大厅，在选举之后，它将被扩大到包括新镇长的办公室。作为镇议会剩下的两名成员，西尔达-霍尔温特和哈尔滨-维斯特目前在这里共享办公空间。",
	"After the characters have met some of the locals and heard what's known about the events at Tresendar Manor and the disappearance of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose, they can investigate the fallen manor and the dungeons beneath it. Once a small but elegant estate, the ruined building sits upon a hill overlooking Phandalin. Years of neglect had already done considerable damage to the structure, only some of which the Golden Mongoose adventurers had restored. But the recent attacks undid all that work, pulling most of the above-ground structure down.": "在人物认识了一些当地人，并听说了关于特伦达庄园事件和金驼团员失踪的情况后，他们可以调查这个倒塌的庄园和它下面的地牢。这座破败的建筑曾经是一个小而优雅的庄园，坐落在俯瞰潘达林的山丘上。多年的忽视已经对该建筑造成了相当大的破坏，只有部分被金枪鱼冒险家们修复了。但最近的攻击使所有的工作都付诸东流，将大部分的地面结构拉倒了。",
	"The orrery's components are set up so that their magic gets weird while the orrery is in pieces. At your determination, that magic might act in unpredictable ways, not recharge as often as normal, or add random effects to keep the characters on their toes. One aspect of this unpredictability comes into play in the adventure when the tiefling Talanatha uses the {@item timepiece of travel|AI} to escape from the attack on Tresendar Manor, only to have the timepiece stay behind (see later on in this episode for details).": "箭塔的组件被设置成在箭塔被破坏的时候，它们的魔法会变得很奇怪。在你的决定下，这些魔法可能会以不可预测的方式发挥作用，不象正常情况下那样频繁地充能，或者增加随机效果以使人物保持警惕。这种不可预测性的一个方面在冒险中出现了，当铁皮人塔拉纳塔使用{@item timepiece of travel|AI}从对特伦达庄园的攻击中逃脱时，计时器却被留下来了（详见本集后面）。",
	"When the characters reach the top of the hill and get a closer look at the ruins of Tresendar Manor, read the following:": "当人物到达山顶，仔细观察特伦达庄园的废墟时，请阅读以下内容。",
	"Many of the crumbled walls of the manor show signs of having been recently rebuilt, but even that newer stonework has been toppled and smashed, coating everything in the area with a thick layer of dust. Temporary structures seemingly set up to aid the reconstruction have been badly damaged by force and fire, though a couple of wooden buildings still stand amid the destruction.": "庄园的许多坍塌的墙壁显示出最近被重建的迹象，但即使是那些较新的石制品也被推倒和砸碎，给该地区的一切都涂上了一层厚厚的灰尘。似乎是为了帮助重建而建立的临时建筑已经被武力和火灾严重破坏，尽管有几座木制建筑仍然矗立在破坏之中。",

After careful scrutineering and research, the Golden Mongoose adventurers learned that the timepiece had magical powers dedicated to navigation and teleportation, and speculated that it was just one piece of a larger and more potent magic device.": "{@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW|Gildha}对这个装置有一些了解，她称之为{@item timepiece of travel|AI}。6个月前，金獴团契在一个邪恶的冒险团手中发现了这个遗物，他们声称不久前从一个被亡灵困扰的坟墓里拿走了它。经过仔细的检查和研究，金驼队的冒险家们了解到这个计时器具有专门用于导航和传送的神奇力量，并推测它只是一个更大、更有力的魔法装置的一个部件。",
	"During the attack, Gildha saw one of the Golden Mongoose adventurers—a female tiefling paladin occultant named Talanatha Three-Coins—activate the {@item timepiece of travel|AI} and teleport away. For reasons unknown, the timepiece stayed behind (see the \"{@area Level Inappropriate|0bf|x}\" sidebar). Gildha grabbed the relic, but has no idea where Talanatha went.": "在攻击过程中，Gildha看到一个金艋舺的冒险者--一个名叫Talanatha Three-Coins的女铁弗林圣骑士神秘主义者--激活了{@item timepiece of travel|AI}并传送离开。由于未知的原因，计时器被留下来了（见\"{@area Level Inappropriate|0bf|x} \"侧边栏）。吉尔达抓住了这个遗物，但不知道塔拉纳塔去了哪里。",
	"Gildha also tells the characters that she saw some of the attackers heading into a small cellar beneath the manor, consisting of storage areas and a spring-fed cistern. She knows that the manor features subterranean areas more extensive than the cellar, but the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose had yet to do a thorough search of those areas. (As a result, Gildha doesn't know about the secret door that leads to the dungeon.)": "Gildha还告诉角色们，她看到一些袭击者进入了庄园下面的一个小地窖，里面有储藏区和一个有泉水的蓄水池。她知道庄园的地下区域比地窖更广阔，但金驼团契还没有对这些区域进行彻底搜查。(因此，吉尔德哈不知道通往地窖的秘密门）。",
	"Although the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose didn't find the secret door leading into the hidden basement beneath the manor, the agents of the Six did. They then made extensive use of the dungeon before departing. Map 2.2 shows the layout of the dungeons beneath the manor.": "虽然金驼团没有找到通往庄园下面隐藏的地下室的暗门，但六人组的特工却找到了。然后他们在离开之前大量使用了这个地牢。地图2.2显示了庄园下面的地牢的布局。",

	"Most doors in the dungeon are wooden, and are closed and unlocked. If a door is locked, it takes a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools to open it. A locked door can also be smashed open with a successful DC 15 Strength check.": "地牢里的大多数门都是木制的，而且是关着的，也可以不上锁。如果一扇门被锁住了，需要用盗贼的工具成功地进行DC10灵巧检查才能打开它。被锁住的门也可以通过成功的DC15力量检查来砸开。",

	"The Splintfig sisters sell rare herbs and spell components, and were visiting the manor to see if the franchisees wanted any of their wares. Their choice to stay the night turned out to be a textbook case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time when the Six's operatives attacked.

Drahkso took pity on the sisters and refused to kill them, so his comrades locked him up with them.": "斯普林特菲格姐妹卖的是稀有的草药和法术组件，她们正在参观庄园，看看加盟商是否想要她们的产品。她们选择在这里过夜，结果是一个教科书式的案例，即在错误的时间出现在错误的地点，而六人帮的特工则发动了攻击。Splintfigs在攻击期间躲了起来，但德拉克索-布莱克伯兹（Drahkso Blaakberz），一个龙裔雇佣兵和攻击部队的一员，发现了他们。Drahkso怜悯这对姐妹，拒绝杀死她们，于是他的战友们把他和她们关在一起。",
	"The sisters talked to Drahkso a bit, and learned he was a mercenary hired to attack the manor. He mentioned that his employer was a short, hooded person who sounded like a goblin. Eventually, some thugs came and took Drahkso away. They then returned with his corpse and tossed it back in the cell.": "姐妹们和Drahkso聊了一会，得知他是受雇来攻击庄园的雇佣兵。他提到他的雇主是一个矮小的、戴着头罩的人，听起来像个妖精。最后，一些暴徒来了，把Drahkso带走了。然后他们带着他的尸体回来，把它扔回了牢房。",

Still others are Six agents who died during the attack.": "仔细检查这些仍然完好无损的尸体，发现每具尸体上都有与墙壁上雕刻的符文相匹配的纹身。这些尸体穿着各式各样的衣服和盔甲，但都被剥夺了所有的贵重物品和装备。有些是金驼团契的成员和工作人员。还有一些是六人帮的特工在从北方向庄园移动时遇到的无辜旁观者。还有一些是在袭击中死亡的六人组特工。",
	"A character who has proficiency in {@skill Arcana} can attempt a DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check when examining the corpses and sigils. With a success, the character discerns that the runes are connected to a ritual that could open a rift to the Far Realm. The dead humanoids were likely victims sacrificed to power the ritual.

	"The franchise is licensed to operate in Phandalin and within 5 miles of the town, and is protected against interference in that area from other franchises.": "该特许经营权被许可在范达林和该镇5英里范围内经营，并在该地区受到保护，免受其他特许经营权的干扰。",
	"Acquisitions Incorporated will deal with acquiring the rights to Tresendar Manor from Harbin Wester, as they did for the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose.": "收购公司将处理从哈尔滨维斯特收购特伦达尔庄园的权利，就像他们为金驼团契所做的那样。",
	"\"{@book Franchise Advancement|AI|1|Franchise Advancement}\" in chapter 2 has detailed explanations of all these benefits and more.": "第二章中的\"{@book Franchise Advancement|AI|1|Franchise Advancement} \"详细解释了所有这些好处，以及更多。",
	"One of the franchise's first hires might be right in front of them already. {@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW}, former majordomo for the Company of the Golden Mongoose, is grieving her lost employers and anxious to put her life back together. With previous experience running a franchise (and no fault in that franchise's destruction), she makes an excellent choice for majordomo, and suggests that role for herself if the characters don't ask her. The remaining episodes in this adventure assume that the characters selected {@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW} as their franchise's majordomo. If they chose another NPC to fill that role, simply adjust the text throughout the adventure accordingly.": "特许经营的第一批雇员之一可能已经在他们面前了。{@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW}，前金驼公司的主事人，正在为她失去的雇主感到悲伤，并急于把她的生活重新安排好。她以前有经营特许经营权的经验（而且在特许经营权的破坏中没有过错），她是一个很好的选择，如果角色不要求她的话，她建议自己担任这个角色。在这次冒险中的其余情节中，假设人物选择了{@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW}作为他们的特许经营权的主人公。如果他们选择了另一个NPC来充当这个角色，只需在整个冒险过程中对文本进行相应的调整。",
	"With the contract signed, the ruins of Tresendar Manor become the franchise's starter headquarters! One of the benefits of Head Office negotiating with Harbin Wester for the lease to the manor is that the company can drive a much harder bargain than the characters would ever be able to strike. This beneficial deal might have hidden downsides, though, as the thin profit margins of the lease become a point of ongoing conflict between the characters and the corrupt banker.": "随着合同的签署，特伦达庄园的废墟成为特许经营的启动总部 总公司与哈尔滨维斯特公司就庄园的租约进行谈判的好处之一是，该公司可以比角色们更努力地进行讨价还价。不过，这种有利的交易可能有隐藏的弊端，因为租约的薄利多销成为人物与腐败的银行家之间持续冲突的一个点。",
	"At the signing of the franchise agreement, each character picks one of the positions detailed in \"{@book Company Positions|AI|1|Company Positions}\" in chapter 2. When they do so, Viari hands out any special position gear and instructs the characters in how best to fulfill their roles. Chapter 2 has more details on these positions, the benefits they confer, and what they mean to the franchise. Hopefully, the players have already considered what positions are the best fit for their characters and for the franchise as a whole, but if not, give them time. Make sure it's clear what each position entails and what franchise duties a character with a given position is expected to perform.": "在签署特许经营协议时，每个角色都会选择第二章\"{@book Company Positions|AI|1|Company Positions} \"中详述的一个职位。当他们这样做时，Viari会发放任何特殊的职位装备，并指导人物如何最好地履行他们的角色。第二章有更多关于这些职位的细节，它们所带来的好处，以及它们对特许经营的意义。希望玩家们已经考虑过哪些职位最适合他们的角色和整个特许经营权，但如果没有，请给他们时间。要确保清楚每个职位需要什么，以及拥有特定职位的角色应该履行哪些特许经营职责。",
	"In addition to the characters' positions, the franchise majordomo can also select a company position if desired. This is especially useful if there's a key position that none of the players wants to take, or if the party size is small.": "除了人物的职位外，如果需要的话，特许经营商也可以选择一个公司的职位。如果有一个关键职位没有人愿意担任，或者党员人数不多，这就特别有用。",
	"The process of rebuilding Tresendar Manor will take some time, and as proud franchise owners, the characters need to be around to pitch in and make sure nothing goes awry. At the same time, their newly awarded territory is ripe for exploration and interaction with potential customers and business partners. As the characters take stock of their situation, they can engage in downtime activities and undertake some of the franchise tasks that operate alongside the downtime rules.": "重建特伦达庄园的过程将需要一些时间，作为自豪的特许经营权所有者，这些人物需要在身边投其所好，确保不会出现任何意外。同时，他们新获得的领土已经成熟，可以与潜在的客户和商业伙伴进行探索和互动。随着人物对自己情况的评估，他们可以参与停工活动，并承担一些与停工规则同时运作的特许经营任务。",
	"All the activities mentioned in this section are introduced or talked about in the \"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime}\" section in chapter 2. That section notes which books existing activities can be found in.": "本节中提到的所有活动都在第二章的\"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime} \"部分进行了介绍或谈论。该部分指出了现有活动可以在哪些书中找到。",
	"As the characters spend time establishing their new commercial home turf, the explore territory downtime activity can yield up all kinds of new opportunities and connections. Interesting NPCs might be revealed on a walkabout in the woods around Phandalin, or the characters might locate stands of prime timber or abandoned mines still holding valuable ore. Such resources can become part of the franchise's ongoing revenue stream.": "当人物花时间建立他们新的商业主场时，探索领土的闲暇活动可以产生各种新的机会和联系。有趣的NPC可能会在范达林周围的树林中被发现，或者人物可能会找到优质木材或废弃的矿井，这些矿井仍有宝贵的矿石。这些资源可以成为特许经营权的持续收入来源的一部分。",
	"Commercial connections forged with NPCs could also be formalized and refined. The lizardfolk of the Mere of Dead Men and the Splintfig sisters are just two of the potential business partnerships from this episode, whether the characters engage those NPCs themselves or allocate members of their brand-new staff for those tasks.": "与NPC建立的商业联系也可以被正式化和完善。死人谷的蜥蜴人和Splintfig姐妹只是这一集中的两个潜在的商业伙伴关系，无论人物是自己与这些NPC打交道，还是分配他们全新的员工去完成这些任务。",
	"In Phandalin, the characters might use the marketeering activity to set up a partnership with Linene Graywind at the Lionshield Coster, or with Sharna Quirstiron of the Phandalin Miner's Exchange—whether they know Sharna's true allegiances or not. Depending on how well the characters are getting along with Harbin Wester, the shady business practice activity might let them get more dirt on the banker, or gain his favor by going after some of his rivals.": "在潘达林，角色们可能会利用市场活动与狮盾成本商的Linene Graywind建立合作关系，或者与潘达林矿工交易所的Sharna Quirstiron建立合作关系--无论他们是否知道Sharna的真实忠诚。根据人物与哈尔滨-维斯特相处的情况，这种不光彩的商业行为可能会让他们得到更多关于银行家的污点，或者通过对他的一些竞争对手下手来获得他的青睐。",
	"Shady business practices might be an even bigger part of the characters' plans for their franchise. Any number of dodgy NPCs in town might be interested in partnering with characters who want to skirt the law. Smuggling ore without paying taxes, skimming from the coffers of either temple, running illegal gambling at the Sleeping Giant—any of these activities could net a nice profit with relatively limited risk.": "阴暗的商业行为可能是这些人物的特许经营计划中更重要的一部分。镇上任何一个狡猾的NPC都可能对与那些想规避法律的角色合作感兴趣。走私矿石而不交税，从神庙的库房里偷钱，在沉睡的巨人那里进行非法赌博--这些活动中的任何一个都可以在相对有限的风险下获得丰厚的利润。",
	"If the characters have nobler aspirations for their franchise—or if they're savvy enough to want to hide their franchise's ignoble aspirations from the get-go—a philanthropic enterprise can go a long way toward shoring up the party's reputation. A franchise could work to support the existing charity efforts of either of the local temples, or the characters could create their own fund for out-of-work miners. Doing so makes acquiring ongoing concessions or information from townsfolk much easier, but puts the characters in the bad graces of Sharna Quirstiron at the Miner's Exchange.": "如果人物对他们的特许经营权有更高的追求--或者如果他们足够精明，想从一开始就隐藏他们特许经营权的不光彩的追求--那么慈善事业可以在很大程度上巩固党的声誉。特许经营权可以支持当地寺庙的现有慈善工作，或者这些人物可以为失业的矿工创建自己的基金。这样做可以更容易地从镇民那里获得持续的优惠或信息，但也会使角色们受到矿工交易所的莎尔娜-奎斯特隆的恶感。",
	"Many of the locals had interactions with Talanatha in the three months that the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was around Phandalin, and characters can use the schmoozing or carousing downtime activities to learn more about the tiefling. In particular, a number of the regulars at the Sleeping Giant remember drinking with Talanatha. She often grumbled about whether the Company of the Golden Mongoose was the best fit for her, and talked about a good friend named Wizzy who worked for another Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. The details on Wizzy's franchise are vague, but Talanatha spoke of her friend having \"an awesome headquarters up the coast.\"": "在金驼队在潘达林附近的三个月里，许多当地人都与塔拉纳塔有过交往，角色们可以利用闲暇时间的攀谈或狂欢活动来了解这个铁皮人。特别是，沉睡的巨人的一些常客都记得和塔拉纳塔一起喝酒。她经常埋怨金驼公司是否最适合她，并谈到一个叫威兹的好朋友，他在另一家收购公司的专营店工作。关于Wizzy的特许经营权的细节很模糊，但塔拉纳塔谈到她的朋友在 \"海岸上有一个很棒的总部\"。",
	"Characters can also spend downtime investigating the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} and the {@item timepiece of travel|AI}, using either the scrutineering or research activities. In addition to revealing more details of the orrery as you see fit (see {@book appendix D|AI|6}), such investigation could reveal that the last place the timepiece teleported someone to was a location on the Sea of Swords, north of Neverwinter but south of Luskan. Scrutineering or inquiries through Head Office turns up information on an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise based in that area—the Order of the Stout Half-Pint, which has its headquarters in an old lighthouse along a stretch of coast known locally as Silent Sound.": "角色也可以用停工期来调查{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}和{@item timepiece of travel|AI}，使用检查或研究活动。除了揭示更多你认为合适的钟表细节外（见{@book appendix D|AI|6}），这样的调查可以发现计时器最后传送到的地方是剑海的一个地方，在永冬的北部，但在卢斯坎的南部。通过总部的调查或查询，发现了一个收购公司在该地区的特许经营权的信息--Stout Half-Pint骑士团，其总部设在当地称为Silent Sound的海岸线上的一座旧灯塔里。",
	"Whatever clues the characters obtain regarding Talanatha's likely destination, have those hints play out over the full length of the downtime rather than rushing to advance to the next episode. The players should get used to how big a part downtime and franchise activities play in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.": "无论角色们获得了关于Talanatha可能的目的地的什么线索，都要让这些暗示在整个停工期内发挥出来，而不是急于推进到下一集。玩家应该习惯于在收购公司的活动中，停工期和特许经营活动所占的比重有多大。",
	"Before the next phase of the adventure, make sure the characters have their franchise and business affairs in order. They should know who their franchise employees are, giving those staff members detailed instructions about what to do while the characters are away. This sort of planning is a common theme in any Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, so establish this precedent early.": "在冒险的下一阶段之前，要确保角色们把他们的特许经营权和商业事务安排妥当。他们应该知道谁是他们的特许经营员工，给这些员工以详细的指示，告诉他们在人物不在的时候应该做什么。这种计划是任何收购公司活动的共同主题，所以要尽早建立这种先例。",
	"Speculating that Talanatha Three-Coins might have fled to the Silent Sound lighthouse headquarters of another Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, the characters might attempt to make contact with that franchise, either on their own or through Head Office. However, any such attempts yield no response. At some point, Omin Dran contacts the characters if they don't contact him first. He's worried about what the lack of contact with the Order of the Stout Half-Pint might mean, and he wants the characters to investigate.": "角色们猜测塔拉纳塔-三钱可能已经逃到了另一家收购公司的寂静之声灯塔总部，他们可能会试图与该公司取得联系，无论是自己还是通过总部。然而，任何这样的尝试都没有得到回应。在某些时候，如果他们不先联系Omin Dran，他就会联系这些角色。他很担心与 \"半品脱啤酒团 \"缺乏联系意味着什么，他希望角色们能进行调查。",
	"The presence of Dran Enterprises operatives in Phandalin is troubling for Omin—especially if the Dran Enterprises hobgoblins were killed without the characters questioning them, leading to the assumption that the organization was behind the initial attack. If the characters aren't suitably intrigued by the orrery and its newly discovered component, that can be another thing that Omin charges them with investigating. Armed with a solid guess that Talanatha fled to the lighthouse, the characters prepare to head north!": "德兰企业的特工出现在范达林，这让奥明感到不安--特别是如果德兰企业的霍布林在人物没有询问他们的情况下被杀，就会导致假设该组织是最初袭击的幕后黑手。如果角色们没有适当地对桔梗和它新发现的组件产生兴趣，那就可以成为Omin责成他们调查的另一件事。带着对塔拉纳塔逃往灯塔的可靠猜测，角色们准备向北出发",
	"In this episode, the characters (newly enfranchised and now 3rd level) travel to the Silent Sound lighthouse to search for Talanatha, the tiefling paladin occultant of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose. On the way, Omin Dran contacts them with a request. He wants them to stop in Neverwinter to check on a cache of Acquisitions Incorporated treasure being stored there. However, the doppelganger who hid the cache has been arrested and is about to be executed. Even if the characters save her, retrieving the treasure where it's been hidden in the House of Knowledge—Oghma's temple in Neverwinter—will take more time and effort than Omin predicted.": "在这一集里，角色们（刚被授予权利，现在是3级）前往寂静之音灯塔，寻找金驼团契的铁皮人圣骑士神秘主义者塔拉纳塔。在路上，奥明-德兰联系了他们，提出了一个请求。他希望他们在永夜城停留，检查存放在那里的收购公司的宝藏。然而，藏匿宝藏的二重身已被逮捕，即将被处决。即使角色们救了她，要找回藏在知识之家--奥格玛在永冬的寺庙里的宝藏，也要比奥明预想的花费更多的时间和精力。",
	"Leaving Neverwinter, the characters head north in the direction of Silent Sound. But even as the lighthouse comes into view, they spot a small boat under attack by creatures from the deep. If they rescue the crew, the characters might find a business opportunity that involves partaking in a little mutiny against a ruthless captain.": "离开永无止境，人物向北朝寂静湾的方向走去。但就在灯塔出现的时候，他们发现一艘小船受到了来自深海的生物的攻击。如果他们能救出船员，人物可能会发现一个商机，那就是参与对抗无情的船长的小叛乱。",
	"At the lighthouse, the characters confirm that the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise headquartered there—the Order of the Stout Half-Pint—was attacked, and that most of its members have been killed. Moving up through the different levels of the lighthouse tower, the franchisees find more and more evidence that the same spellcaster whose creations they've previously faced has wrought havoc there. That spellcaster, Hoobur Gran'Shoop, is found working in a grisly laboratory beneath the tower, to which the adventurers gain entrance through the lighthouse's magic lens. That laboratory is only part of the lighthouse's secret basement, though, and the characters engage in some dangerous and lucrative dungeoneering after dealing with—or doing a deal with—Hoobur.": "在灯塔上，这些人物确认总部设在那里的收购公司的特许经营权--坚固的半品脱骑士团--受到了攻击，而且其大部分成员都被杀害了。通过灯塔的不同楼层，加盟商们发现越来越多的证据表明，他们之前面对的那个施法者在这里造成了巨大的破坏。这个施法者名叫胡伯-格兰肖普（Hoobur Gran'Shoop），被发现在塔下的一个可怕的实验室里工作，冒险者们通过灯塔的魔镜进入了这个实验室。不过，这个实验室只是灯塔秘密地下室的一部分，在与胡伯打交道或与胡伯做交易后，角色们参与了一些危险而有利可图的地下活动。",
	"With the threats in the lighthouse dispensed with, the characters learn that its franchise members had also recently collected one of the clockwork components of the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}. They also have evidence in hand pointing to the involvement of Dran Enterprises in the attack on the lighthouse, building on the sighting of Dran Enterprises operatives in Phandalin. But what does Dran Enterprises want with the orrery? And which band of plucky franchisees will be tasked with finding out?": "随着灯塔中的威胁被消除，角色们了解到其特许经营成员最近也收集了{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}的一个发条部件。他们还掌握了证据，表明德兰企业参与了对灯塔的袭击，这是在范达林看到德兰企业人员的基础上形成的。但是，德兰企业想要什么？哪一队勇敢的加盟者将负责找出答案？",
	"With the franchise headquarters in Phandalin secured and the rebuilding of Tresendar Manor underway, the adventurers have a clear path ahead of them to the Silent Sound lighthouse. However, you get to decide how complicated the journey turns out to be.": "随着位于范达林的特许经营总部的安全和特伦达庄园的重建工作的进行，冒险家们有了一条通往寂静之音灯塔的明确道路。然而，你可以决定这段旅程会有多复杂。",
	"Before the characters leave for the lighthouse, or while they are on the High Road traveling toward Neverwinter, Omin Dran makes contact with a \"small favor.\" Neverwinter is located on the High Road on the way to the Silent Sound lighthouse, so is an easy stop for the party to make.": "在人物出发去灯塔之前，或者当他们在前往永夜城的大路上时，奥明-德兰联系到了一个 \"小忙\"。永温特位于通往寂静之音灯塔的公路上，所以对他们来说是一个很容易到达的地方。",
	"Head Office assignments of this sort can become common in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, especially as the characters' reputation as troubleshooters grows. You can use such side treks as useful support for a franchise's main mission, or as an inconvenient interruption.": "在收购公司的活动中，这种总部的任务很常见，特别是当角色作为麻烦解决者的声誉越来越高时。你可以把这种副业作为对特许经营的主要任务的有益支持，或者作为一种不方便的干扰。",

	"\"Yeah, so I'm going to need you to do a little extra work for me. It shouldn't be too taxing. I have a contact in Neverwinter who's secured a cache of treasure. Her name is Oppal DeScart, and you can usually find her in a tavern in the Blacklake District known as the Stable Quiver. She's a shapeshifter, so I can't say for sure what she'll look like when you locate her. You can suss her out with the passphrase \"That's a big hen house,\" and she should reply with \"Only to a small fox.\" When you locate her, tell her that it's safe to \"Move the cargo along the Platinum Road.\" And that's it. She'll give you the treasure to get out of Neverwinter safely. The whole affair should take a few hours, and then you can be on your way. You can get the goods to me when you return.\"": "\"是的，所以我需要你为我做一点额外的工作。这应该不会太累人。我在永夜城有一个联系人，他获得了一批宝藏。她的名字叫Oppal DeScart，你通常可以在黑湖区的一家名为Stable Quiver的酒馆中找到她。她是个变身人，所以我不能确定你找到她时她会是什么样子。你可以用 \"那是个大鸡舍 \"来打探她，她应该回答 \"只对小狐狸\"。当你找到她时，告诉她，\"沿着白金路移动货物 \"是安全的。就这样了。她会给你宝藏，让你安全离开永夜城。整个事件应该只需要几个小时，然后你就可以上路了。你回来后可以把货物交给我。\"",
	"Omin's primary concern is to have Oppal's treasure secured and removed from the city without drawing the attention of Neverwinter's tax collectors. He tells the characters that the treasure is small but its container is warded, and that they should be prepared to store and carry it without looking in it. Omin isn't keen to get into additional details, though, suggesting that the less the characters know, the better. (This is another potentially entertaining hallmark of assignments handed down from Head Office, and plausible deniability is one of the core competencies of any successful Acquisitions Incorporated franchise.)": "奥明最关心的是如何保护奥帕尔的财宝，并在不引起永夜的收税员注意的情况下将其运出城市。他告诉角色们，宝藏不大，但它的容器有防护措施，他们应该准备好储存和携带它而不看里面。但奥明并不热衷于了解更多的细节，他认为人物知道的越少越好。(这是总部下达的任务的另一个潜在的娱乐性特征，而合理的推诿是任何成功的收购公司特许经营的核心竞争力之一）。",
	"Either on their way to Neverwinter or while in the city, the characters might want to dig around a bit to find out more about what exactly they're getting into.

Part of the metropolis is magnificent, with breathtaking architecture, marvelous spires, and opulent decorations. And amid that beauty is a terrible scar caused by the eruption of Mount Hotenow years before.

	"If the characters question the defeated bandits, the criminals admit to working for Moguhl from time to time, but they can provide no other actionable information. If Moguhl is captured and convinced to talk, she can provide intelligence on the prison beneath Castle Never, which she has been gathering in case she needs to break in to talk to Oppal.": "如果角色们询问被打败的强盗，罪犯们会承认不时为Moguhl工作，但他们无法提供其他可操作的信息。如果莫古尔被抓获并被说服谈话，她可以提供关于永无城堡下面的监狱的情报，她一直在收集这些情报，以备她需要闯入与奥帕尔谈话。",

	"The first step to rescuing Oppal is to communicate with her in some way. However, if a plan is hatched that allows the characters to message her indirectly through a third party (a bribed guard or worker, for instance), Oppal's response makes it clear that she is willing to pass along \"the information\" only if she is liberated. She understands that the characters' timely appearance is the only thing that stands between her and certain death.": "救出奥帕尔的第一步是以某种方式与她沟通。然而，如果计划允许人物通过第三方（例如被收买的警卫或工人）间接向她传递信息，那么奥帕尔的反应表明，只有当她被释放后，她才愿意传递 \"信息\"。她明白，这些人物的及时出现是她与死亡之间的唯一障碍。",

	"Like much of the city of Neverwinter, the Hall of Knowledge is currently under repair. Although some of the temple was damaged by the volcano, portions were spared the destruction of the lava flow, including an underground chamber called the Vault of Tomes. That undercroft contains some of the most rare and valuable books in Faerûn outside Candlekeep, and is one of the most secure locations in the city as a result. By disguising herself as an acolyte, Oppal was able to place the false tome in the vault.": "和永夜城的许多地方一样，知识殿堂目前也在维修之中。虽然神殿的一些部分被火山破坏了，但有些部分却没有被熔岩流破坏，其中包括一个叫做 \"宝库 \"的地下室。那间地下室里有一些烛龙镇以外的法鲁恩最稀有和最有价值的书籍，因此是城市中最安全的地方之一。通过伪装成一名圣徒，奥帕尔得以将假的巨著放入金库。",
	"On Omin's instructions, Oppal hired a wizard to place a {@spell glyph of warding} (explosive runes) on the false book to keep it from being opened.

	"Once freed, Oppal is unwilling to assist in any further capers, wanting only to get out of Neverwinter alive. No amount of threatening or cajoling can inspire her to assist the characters. She suggests that they acquire the book, seal it inside something else so as to avoid accidentally triggering the glyph, and leave the city as quickly as possible. They can deliver the goods to Omin at their leisure after that.": "一旦被释放，奥帕尔就不愿意再协助任何进一步的行动，只想活着离开永夜城。无论怎样的威胁和劝说都无法让她帮助这些角色。她建议他们取得那本书，把它封在别的东西里，以避免意外地触发石刻，然后尽快离开这个城市。之后，他们可以在闲暇时将货物交给奥明。",
	"The Hall of Knowledge is a major temple in Neverwinter, acting as a place of learning, a center of socialization, and a repository of government documentation while Castle Never is being rebuilt.

	"Grand Scribe Spivey Liethennson oversees the temple, ruling his limited domain with all the fervor his fragile body can muster. Acolytes and workers freeze in terror when his labored breathing warns of his approach, because he rarely has a kind word to say.

In the meantime, he hopes to impress church elders by running the Hall of Knowledge with an iron hand.": "大抄写员斯皮维-利特森负责监督神庙，用他脆弱的身体所能容纳的所有热情来统治他有限的领域。当他费力的呼吸警告他的到来时，圣徒和工人们都吓得呆住了，因为他很少说一句好话。利特森渴望离开这座城市，与他的奥格玛崇拜者们一起在烛台镇的宁静中生活。同时，他希望通过铁腕管理知识殿堂来打动教会的长老。",
	"If any characters have lycanthropy from their run-in with Moguhl Vloot, Grand Scribe Liethennson can cast {@spell remove curse} for a donation of 50 gp. If he feels indebted to the characters (see \"{@area Alternative Entry|135|x}\" below), he might cast the spell for free.": "如果任何角色因为与莫古尔-弗洛特的冲突而有狼人症，大抄写员李特森可以施展{@spell remove curse}，并捐赠50金币。如果他觉得对这些角色有亏欠（见下面的\"{@area Alternative Entry|135|x}\"），他可能会免费施放这个法术。",
	"Anyone can enter the temple to worship Oghma at a shrine on the first floor. Acolytes and lesser clerics are available to perform rituals for a suitable donation. The first floor also contains books and scrolls of common value, as well as public documents moved here from Castle Never. The second floor holds sleeping quarters and private work areas for staff and clergy, while the basement includes storage rooms, private shrines for generous donors, and the Vault of Tomes.": "任何人都可以进入寺庙，在一楼的神龛上祭拜奥格玛。只要有适当的捐款，圣职者和较低级别的神职人员都可以进行仪式。一楼还存放着具有普遍价值的书籍和卷轴，以及从梦幻城堡转移到这里的公共文件。二楼是工作人员和神职人员的寝室和私人工作区，而地下室则包括储藏室、慷慨捐赠者的私人神龛和古籍库。",
	"At any opportune moment as the characters are within or approaching the temple, they see Kwarter drop her tools at Liethennson's feet, make a rude gesture in his direction, and call on her workers to leave. She knows that she and her team can find easier work for more money elsewhere in the city. Quick-thinking characters can seize this opportunity to pretend to be masons, carpenters, or other craftspeople to gain access to the basement level. This doesn't grant characters access to the Vault of Tomes, but it gets them close.": "当人物在寺庙内或接近寺庙时，在任何合适的时刻，他们都会看到夸特将她的工具丢在利特森的脚下，向他的方向做了一个粗鲁的手势，并叫她的工人离开。她知道她和她的团队可以在这个城市的其他地方找到更容易赚钱的工作。思维敏捷的人物可以抓住这个机会，假装成石匠、木匠或其他工匠，以获得进入地下室的机会。这并不能让人物进入金库，但可以让他们接近。",
	"If the players prefer action, an emergency in the temple could assist them in their quest. An eldritch tome stored in the vault has its dweomer suddenly fail, unleashing a burst of arcane energy that animates two statues in the vault. As the characters case the temple, screams and shouts are heard as the statues run amok. The two veterans on guard step up, only to quickly fall victim to the animated statues. The characters can use the distraction to slip into the vault while scribes and acolytes flee, or they can deal with the threat to earn the favor of Grand Scribe Liethennson.": "如果玩家喜欢行动，神庙里的紧急情况可以帮助他们完成任务。储存在金库中的一本长生书突然失灵，释放出一阵奥术能量，使金库中的两座雕像活了起来。当人物进入神庙时，尖叫声和呼喊声响起，这些雕像乱作一团。两名守卫的老兵走上前去，但很快就成了雕像动画的受害者。角色们可以在文士和信徒们逃跑的时候利用这个分心的机会溜进金库，或者他们可以处理这个威胁，以赢得大文士李特森的青睐。",
	"Each of the animated statues uses the {@creature gargoyle} stat block.": "每个动画雕像都使用{@creature gargoyle}雕像块。",
	"Even after the characters have accessed the basement, entering the Vault of Tomes while it's locked down is a challenge. The door to the vault employs a complex three-stage lock, requiring three successful DC 20 Dexterity checks using thieves' tools to open. If the characters take too long to open the lock, staff or clergy might notice them, alerting any veterans on watch.": "即使人物已经进入了地下室，在地下室被锁住的情况下进入金库也是一个挑战。通往金库的门采用了复杂的三级锁，需要使用盗贼工具进行三次成功的DC20灵巧检查才能打开。如果人物花了太长时间来打开锁，工作人员或神职人员可能会注意到他们，提醒任何守卫的老兵。",
	"If the characters defeated the statues, they have the thanks of Grand Scribe Liethennson. He is reluctant to allow anyone other than worshipers of Oghma into the Vault of Tomes, but characters with his favor have an easy time convincing him of their need to do obscure research or similar claims.": "如果人物打败了雕像，他们就会得到大抄写员Liethennson的感谢。他不愿意让奥格玛的崇拜者以外的人进入古籍库，但得到他青睐的人物很容易说服他他们需要进行晦涩的研究或类似的主张。",

	"A successful check determines that while four of the gems are real diamonds (5,000 gp each), eight are actually finely cut smoky quartz (10 gp each). Omin knows that Oppal mixed the fakes with the real diamonds to throw off would-be thieves, allowing her to offer them the quartz while she used legerdemain to retain the valuable ones. Characters who don't know this might sweat a bit as they try to figure out how to explain the situation to Omin.": "检查成功后，可以确定其中四颗宝石是真的钻石（每颗5,000金币），八颗实际上是切割精细的烟熏石英（每颗10金币）。奥明知道奥帕尔把假钻石和真钻石混在一起，以甩掉那些可能的小偷，使她能够向他们提供石英，而她则用诡计保留了有价值的钻石。不知道这一点的人可能会出点汗，因为他们想知道如何向奥明解释这种情况。",
	"The Silent Sound lighthouse sits atop a cliff three days' travel north of Neverwinter, and acts as a navigation beacon to ships traveling up and down the Sword Coast.

	"Whether they're traveling by land, arriving by boat, or teleporting in, the characters witness a disturbing scene as they first catch sight of the lighthouse.": "无论他们是走陆路，还是坐船，或者是传送过来的，当他们第一次看到灯塔的时候，人物都目睹了令人不安的场景。",
	"Silent Sound lighthouse finally comes into view, rising atop a rough and dangerous-looking promontory of rock that thrusts up from the beach behind it and juts into the Sea of Swords. If the lighthouse is supposed to act as a beacon, though, something is seriously wrong. Its top is hazy and indistinct, as if a fog was obscuring the lantern room. Also, for a place that's an occupied headquarters, there's a lot of scaffolding along the tower's base, and three large tents are pitched on the slope of the beach behind the lighthouse promontory.": "寂静之声灯塔终于进入了人们的视线，它耸立在一个粗糙的、看起来很危险的岩石岬角上，从它后面的海滩上突起，伸向剑海。如果这个灯塔应该作为一个灯塔，那么就有严重的问题。它的顶部是朦胧的，不清晰的，就像雾气遮住了灯笼房一样。另外，对于一个被占领的总部的地方来说，沿着塔基有很多脚手架，在灯塔岬角后面的海滩斜坡上搭着三个大帐篷。",
	"Wind and the crashing of waves against the cliffs is loud, but even over that, panicked shouts can be heard. Along the shore next to the beach, tentacles rising from the sea thrash out against a longboat. Three people in the boat are fighting off the tentacles, and are faring poorly.": "风和海浪对悬崖的撞击声很响亮，但即使在这种情况下，也能听到惊慌失措的喊叫声。沿着海滩旁边的海岸，从海中升起的触手向一艘长船激射而去。船上的三个人正在对抗触手，情况很糟。",
	"Three {@creature Giant Octopus||giant octopuses} are attacking a {@vehicle Longship||longboat} and its crew—Belle Mare, Menard Chatte, and Chalkie Sharke (all CG human {@creature Bandit||bandits}). Adjust the fight to the length of time it'll take the characters to reach the scene, depending on how they're traveling. But if they tarry for no particular reason, Menard is dragged into the water, never to surface again. A similar period later, a tentacle pulls Chalkie into the drink. Belle then perishes if the characters ignore the fight completely.": "三个{@creature Giant Octopus||giant octopuses}正在攻击一艘{@vehicle Longship||longboat}及其船员--Belle Mare、Menard Chatte和Chalkie Sharke（都是CG人类{@creature Bandit||bandits}）。根据他们的旅行方式，将战斗调整到人物到达现场所需的时间长度。但如果他们没有特别的原因而耽搁，梅纳德就会被拖入水中，再也无法浮出水面。同样的时间，一个触手将查基拉入水中。如果角色们完全不理会这场战斗，那么贝勒就会灭亡。",
	"If the characters intercede, the sailors fight alongside them until the octopuses are driven away, or the characters convince the sailors to flee to safety.": "如果人物出面调停，水手们就会与他们并肩作战，直到章鱼被赶走，或者人物说服水手们逃到安全地带。",
	"Friedson is a Northlander who has pushed his crew to more and more dangerous and despicable deeds in recent months.

	"Regardless of the characters' decision, Belle also reveals that she knows something is wrong at the Silent Sound lighthouse. For at least two tendays, the normally reliable light has been dark. She fears that some sort of magic is in play, because it isn't just the case that the light is out. Rather, it appears to radiate some kind of dark energy. Moreover, she's heard that sightings of spectral figures and will-o'-wisps in the area are on the rise.": "不管人物的决定如何，贝儿还透露，她知道寂静湾灯塔出了问题。至少有两个工作日，通常可靠的灯光一直是黑暗的。她担心是某种魔法在作祟，因为这不仅仅是灯光熄灭的情况。相反，它似乎放射出某种黑暗的能量。此外，她听说在这一地区看到的幽灵般的人物和巫师的数量在增加。",

	"The smugglers came ashore to retrieve several bolts of rare Calimshan silk to take to an interested buyer in the Moonshae Isles. The five bolts are worth 100 gp each.

Otherwise, Belle recovers the silk before going back to the {@i Tortured Tortle}, but offers the characters 30 gp from her own purse in thanks for their help.": "走私者上岸是为了取回几根稀有的卡林山丝绸，准备带去给摩恩沙群岛的一个感兴趣的买家。这五根丝线每根价值100金币。如果所有的走私者都死了，角色们可能会在附近的一个海洞里找到这些战利品，还有很多普通的物资。否则，贝勒在回到{@i Tortured Tortle}之前收回了丝绸，但为了感谢他们的帮助，她从自己的钱包里拿出了30GP。",
	"The trip back to the {@i Tortured Tortle} is smooth, and the {@vehicle Longship||longboat} sails into position to be hoisted aboard. Belle yells to the watch that she has new crew to bring aboard, and the watch acknowledges the request. This exchange brings the captain—a tall and muscular Northlander—onto the deck. Standing at his side is a short, stocky human female wearing a holy symbol of Umberlee around her neck.": "回到{@i Tortured Tortle}号的旅程很顺利，{@vehicle Longship||longboat}号驶入位置，被吊上船。贝勒向值班人员喊道，她有新的船员要上船，值班人员承认了这个请求。这场交流使船长--一个高大、肌肉发达的北地人--来到了甲板上。站在他身边的是一个矮胖的人类女性，她的脖子上戴着Umberlee的神圣标志。",
	"As the battle continues, you can decide how the rest of the combat goes with regards to additional help.

	"A lot of people think of piracy as a dead-end job or a last-resort career. This is remarkably shortsighted, as the gig has a startling number of upsides. For example, it's a job that allows you to wear a lot of scarves and sashes. That's rare. What's more, you're never more than two steps from some sort of convenient rope that you can cut and use to dramatically swing into danger.What's more, people don't realize that profit-sharing arrangements are surprisingly common, and there are great opportunities for internal promotion of the dead-sailor's-boots variety. Also? There are a lot of dead sailor's boots, and the resale on those can be very high. Good boots are scarce.": "很多人认为盗版是一份无前途的工作，或者是一份最后的职业。这显然是短视的，因为这份工作有许多令人吃惊的好处。例如，这是一份允许你戴很多围巾和腰带的工作。这很难得。更重要的是，你离某种方便的绳子永远不会超过两步之遥，你可以剪断绳子，用来大幅度地摇摆到危险中。更重要的是，人们没有意识到，利润分享安排是惊人的普遍，而且有很好的机会进行死水手的各种内部晋升。另外，有很多死水手的靴子，这些靴子的转售率可以很高。好的靴子是稀缺的。",

It was six months ago that the order came into possession of a piece of the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} called the {@item rotor of return|AI}, and just over a month ago that their search for lore on the rotor came to the attention of the Six. The Six's attack on the lighthouse actually preceded the attack on Phandalin by a few days, and was similarly headed by archmage Hoobur Gran'Shoop. (As a successful franchise, the Order of the Stout Half-Pint has some slack with Head Office, so that their last missed franchise payment didn't draw the same immediate attention as the missed payment from the Phandalin franchise.)": "在该专营权遭遇与金驼团类似的命运之前，坚固半品脱骑士团已将灯塔作为其总部使用了两年。就在六个月前，骑士团掌握了一块名为{@item rotor of return|AI}的{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}，而就在一个多月前，他们对转轮上的传说的搜索引起了六人帮的注意。六人帮对灯塔的攻击实际上比对范达林的攻击早了几天，而且同样是由大法师胡伯-格兰肖普领导的。 (作为一个成功的特许经营机构，\"烈性半品脱 \"骑士团对总部有一些懈怠，所以他们上次错过的特许经营权付款并没有像范达林特许经营权错过的付款那样立即引起注意。)",

He has claimed the lighthouse since returning here from Phandalin, finding the basement laboratory to be a perfect place for his experiments. Even as he works for the Six, Hoobur continues to make it look as if he works for Dran Enterprises. The leadership of the Six expects that attacks on two Acquisitions Incorporated franchises will attract the attention of Acq Inc Head Office, and {@creature Splugoth the Returned|AI} wants that attention directed elsewhere while his plan to claim the orrery comes together.": "和{@item timepiece of travel|AI}一样，胡伯至今也没能找到{@item rotor of return|AI}，但他并不在意。自从从范达林回到这里后，他就认领了这座灯塔，发现地下室的实验室是他进行实验的最佳场所。即使他为六人帮工作，胡伯也继续让人觉得他为德兰企业工作。六人帮的领导层预计，对两家收购公司特许经营权的攻击会引起收购公司总部的注意，{@creature Splugoth the Returned|AI}希望在他认领灯塔的计划出台时，把注意力转移到其他地方。",

And what happens if the ship gets into trouble and the characters are constantly called upon to rescue the crew and protect their investment?": "也许，这艘船经过多年的忽视，已经破败不堪。角色们能拿出1,000戈比（帆船价值的十分之一）进行维修吗？如果这艘船遇到了麻烦，而人物又不断地被要求去拯救船员和保护他们的投资，会发生什么？",
	"Authorities across the Sword Coast might also want to arrest the crew for Captain Athgar's misdeeds. If any crew members are caught, the authorities might learn about the ship's business relationship with the franchise, creating potential trouble for the characters.": "整个剑海岸的当局可能也想因为阿斯加船长的不轨行为而逮捕船员。如果有船员被抓，当局可能会了解这艘船与专营权的商业关系，给人物带来潜在的麻烦。",
	"On the beach behind the lighthouse, three large tents are set up as temporary lodgings. The members of the Order of the Stout Half-Pint and their staff were living here while preparing the lighthouse for a new round of franchise renovations. Evidence of a fight from many days ago is spread across the grounds, including slashed canvas and broken weapons. Mundane furniture and gear fills the tents, along with kegs of ale, casks of fresh water, boxes of rations, and bundles of arrows. All the tents feature the Dran Enterprises logo scrawled onto them in chalk.": "在灯塔后面的海滩上，有三顶大帐篷作为临时住所。斯托特半品脱骑士团的成员和他们的工作人员住在这里，同时为灯塔进行新一轮的特许经营改造做准备。许多天前的打斗证据散布在院子里，包括被割破的帆布和破碎的武器。平凡的家具和装备摆满了帐篷，还有一桶桶麦酒、一桶桶淡水、一箱箱口粮和一捆捆箭矢。所有的帐篷上都用粉笔写着德兰企业的标志。",

	"Ceilings are 15 feet high and flat.": "天花板有15英尺高，而且是平的。",
	"The lighthouse is mostly dark. Two lanterns full of oil hang within each level on the east and west walls. Window slits stand 3 feet above the floor on each level, at the center of the north and south walls. These slits are 3 feet high but only a few inches wide, so they're too small to allow passage or let much more than a little dim light in.": "灯塔大部分时间是黑暗的。在东西两面墙上的每一层内都挂着两个装满油的灯笼。每层的窗户缝隙高出地面3英尺，位于南北墙的中心。这些缝隙有3英尺高，但只有几英寸宽，所以它们太小了，不能让人通过，也不能让一点微弱的光线进入。",

	"A successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check notices that the lock of the stone door is connected to wires that run into the tower's stone walls. This custom-built franchise defense system is rigged to release a rain of arrows from turrets up higher on the lighthouse. The trap can be bypassed by pressing a hidden button on the door, requiring a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to find. Or it can be disarmed with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. If the check to disarm fails by 5 or more, the trap is triggered.": "成功通过DC15智慧({@skill Perception})检查，可以注意到石门的锁与贯穿塔内石壁的电线相连。这个定制的特许经营防御系统被设置为从灯塔上更高的炮塔释放箭雨。这个陷阱可以通过按下门上的一个隐藏按钮来绕过，需要成功通过DC15智力（{@skill Investigation}）检查才能找到。或者可以用盗贼的工具，通过成功的DC15灵巧检查来解除它。如果解除武装的检定失败了5次或更多，陷阱就被触发了。",
	"If the trap is activated, each creature within 10 feet of the door must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 ({@dice 6d6}) piercing damage from the rain of arrows on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The trap does not reset itself automatically, but it will be restocked with arrows and reset manually by Hoobur Gran'Shoop's undead minions if the characters are away from the lighthouse for more than a few hours.": "如果陷阱被激活，门外10英尺范围内的每个生物都必须做一个DC15的灵巧救赎，如果救赎失败，将受到21({@dice 6d6})的箭雨穿刺伤害，如果成功，将受到一半的伤害。陷阱不会自动重置，但如果角色离开灯塔超过几个小时，它就会被胡伯-格兰肖普的亡灵爪牙重新装上箭矢并手动重置。",
	"Once the trap is disabled or triggered, the lock on the door can be picked with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The sturdy stone door can also be smashed open with a successful DC 20 Strength check, or it can be battered down (AC 13, 50 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage).": "一旦陷阱失效或被触发，门上的锁可以用盗贼的工具通过DC10的灵巧检查来撬开。坚固的石门也可以用成功的DC20力量检查砸开，或者可以把它打倒（AC13，50点命中，对毒药和精神伤害免疫）。",
	"When the characters gain access to the ground floor, they can see what's inside.": "当人物进入一楼时，他们可以看到里面的东西。",
	"In the center of this square room carved into the base of the promontory, a circular staircase spirals upward. The area has been emptied of furniture, but a number of parchments and maps are tacked onto the walls. The corpse of a halfling is sprawled beneath one of those maps. It isn't moving. However, the spectral halfling hanging motionless in the air above it is very much in motion as it drifts toward you, moaning.": "在这个刻在海角底部的方形房间中央，一个圆形的楼梯盘旋而上。这里的家具已经被清空，但墙上贴着一些羊皮纸和地图。一具半身人的尸体就躺在其中一张地图的下面。它没有动。然而，悬挂在它上方空中一动不动的半身人幽灵却很有活力，它向你飘来，发出呻吟。",
	"The ghost and the corpse are all that remain of a deceased member of the Order of the Stout Half-Pint, Patsy McRoyne. An examination of the body reveals no weapon wounds, but a successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) or Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check finds evidence of necrotic damage. A familiar sigil has been carved into the corpse's chest—a draconic skull pierced by a sword thrust upward through it.": "幽灵和尸体是烈性半品脱骑士团成员帕特西-麦克罗恩的全部遗物。对尸体的检查没有发现武器的伤痕，但如果成功地进行DC10智力({@skill Arcana})或智慧({@skill Medicine})检查，可以发现坏死的证据。尸体的胸口被刻上了一个熟悉的符号--被一把剑向上刺穿的龙人头骨。",

	"A wall calendar with the name \"Wizzy\" on it records adventures the order has undertaken. It also notes intended headquarters renovations that are constantly behind schedule, given how much time the franchise members spend away from the lighthouse adventuring. One of those adventures was a raid on an old tomb six months ago, where they cleared out numerous monsters and found something noted as a \"magic clock.\"": "一本印有 \"Wizzy \"名字的挂历记录了该组织所进行的冒险。它还记录了打算进行的总部装修，这些装修一直落后于计划，因为专营权成员花了很多时间离开灯塔去冒险。其中一次冒险是6个月前对一座古墓的突袭，他们在那里清除了许多怪物，并发现了一个被称为 \"魔法时钟 \"的东西。",
	"The next floor is circular, as the square base cut into the promontory gives way to the upper levels of the tower. The stairway continues its upward spiral from this floor to another. Building implements, tools, and boards line the walls. Three tall wardrobes and four large chests stand among these materials.": "下一层是圆形的，因为切入海角的方形底座为塔的上层让路。楼梯继续螺旋式上升，从这一层到另一层。建筑器具、工具和木板在墙上排列。三个高大的衣柜和四个大箱子矗立在这些材料中。",
	"As you step from the stairs into the single room of this floor, a snarling and growling greets you. On opposite sides of this room stand two vicious-looking hounds with black fur. The creatures smell of sulfur and rot, and both wear ornate collars of silvery metal. Each stands within a square scribed onto the floor, ten feet on a side and edged with runes. The rune-marked boundaries appear to push the creatures back as they try in vain to cross through.": "当你从楼梯步入这层楼的单人房间时，一阵咆哮声迎面而来。在这个房间的两边，站着两只长着黑色皮毛的凶恶的猎犬。这两只动物散发着硫磺和腐烂的气味，都戴着银色金属的华丽项圈。每个人都站在一个刻在地板上的正方形内，边上有十英尺，边缘有符文。当这些生物徒劳地试图穿越时，符文标记的边界似乎将它们推回。",
	"Two {@creature Hell Hound||hell hounds} are presently held within magical wards in this area. Hoobur summoned these fiends but has yet to assign them a task, so he keeps them \"crated\" here.

Unless the hell hounds are first destroyed, the only way to safely climb the stairs is to disarm the runes with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. Failure by 5 or more triggers the runes, releasing the hell hounds. {@spell Dispel magic} can remove the runes from one stair.": "一个知道符文并成功通过DC15智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查的角色会发现，任何踏上被困楼梯的人都会将地狱猎犬从警戒区域释放出来。除非地狱猎犬首先被消灭，否则安全爬上楼梯的唯一方法是通过DC15智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查成功解除符文。失败5次以上会触发符文，释放出地狱猎犬。{@spell Dispel magic}可以移除一个楼梯上的符文。",
	"Each hell hound wears an ornate platinum collar, one etched with the name \"Wilbur\" and the other with \"Wilhelmina.\" Each collar is worth 50 gp.": "每条地狱猎犬都戴着一个华丽的铂金项圈，一个刻着 \"威尔伯 \"的名字，另一个刻着 \"威尔米娜\"。每个项圈价值50戈比。",
	"The circular staircase ends on this floor in a room that contains vibrant decor despite its sparse furnishings—a bed, a dresser, a desk, and a glass tank. Bright paint in a rainbow of colors is splashed on the walls in something that might be a pattern. Garish rugs and tapestries cover the floor and walls. Costume gemstones adorn almost every surface that can contain them.": "环形楼梯在这层楼的尽头是一个房间，尽管家具稀少，却包含了充满活力的装饰--一张床、一个梳妆台、一张桌子和一个玻璃缸。彩虹般明亮的油漆被泼洒在墙上，可能是一种图案。怪异的地毯和挂毯覆盖了地板和墙壁。服装宝石装饰着几乎所有可以容纳它们的表面。",
	"A set of rungs on the south wall gives access to a hatch in the high ceiling. The hatch presumably provides access to the top of the lighthouse and the lantern room.": "南墙上的一组梯子可以通向高高的天花板上的一个舱门。据推测，这个舱口可以通往灯塔的顶部和灯笼房。",
	"If the characters find a way to communicate with Rainbow, it speaks in a droll and erudite accent, laced with casual profanity and dripping with sarcasm. If it can't speak with the characters, Rainbow can spin a web to create words, but these are equally derogatory, bitter, and profanity laced. In either case, the spider can pass along the following information:": "如果角色们找到了与Rainbow交流的方法，它就会用一种有趣的、博学的口音说话，带着随意的脏话，滴水不漏地讽刺。如果它不能与角色交流，Rainbow可以织出一张网来创造文字，但这些文字同样是贬义的、苦涩的、带着亵渎的。在任何一种情况下，蜘蛛都可以传递以下信息。",

Its members had gained enough prestige and capital to acquire the lighthouse, which undergoes an endless spate of renovations.": "坚固的半品脱骑士团是一个成功的冒险专营机构，只由地精和半身人组成。它的成员已经获得了足够的声望和资本来收购灯塔，而灯塔正在进行无休止的翻新。",
	"A weird gnome named Hoobur approached the group a month ago, asking to join them. When the members of the order let their guard down, the new gnome called forth a horde of undead creatures that slaughtered everyone.": "一个名叫胡伯的怪异地精一个月前找到了这个团体，要求加入他们。当骑士团成员放松警惕时，这个新地精召唤出了一群不死生物，屠杀了所有人。",
	"Since then, Rainbow has remained in this area. The spider can feel that its master is not dead, but is also not truly alive. Rainbow believes Wizzy persists in some sort of half-life at the hands of the gnome archmage.": "从那时起，彩虹就一直呆在这个地方。蜘蛛能感觉到它的主人没有死，但也没有真正活着。彩虹相信威兹在地精大法师的手中一直处于某种半死不活的状态。",

	"Rainbow knows that the lantern room at the top of the lighthouse allows people to teleport to the secret basement beneath the tower. However, it shares that information only with characters who agree to search for and save Wizzy. Or put the mage out of his half-dead misery. (The spider isn't choosy; it just wants some closure.) Rainbow does not know the current passphrase to activate the teleporting power of the lighthouse lens.": "彩虹知道灯塔顶部的灯笼室可以让人们传送到塔下的秘密地下室。然而，它只与那些同意寻找和拯救威兹的角色分享这一信息。或者把法师从他半死不活的痛苦中解救出来。(蜘蛛并不挑剔，它只是想要一些结局。) 彩虹不知道目前激活灯塔透镜的传送能力的口令。",
	"The hatch in the ceiling of the fourth floor provides access to the top of the lighthouse. Magical shadow causes this area to be lightly obscured. When the characters arrive, read:": "第四层天花板上的舱门提供了通往灯塔顶部的通道。魔法阴影使这个区域被轻度遮蔽。当人物到达时，阅读。",
	"This area is gloomy and dancing with shadows. A ten-foot-wide catwalk encircles the fifteen-foot-high lantern room housing the lighthouse's crystal lens. The lens rotates lazily, but rather than shedding light, it emanates an aura of cold shadow. The walls of the lantern room are five-foot-wide panels of glass set with a single glass door.": "这个区域是阴暗的，在阴影中跳舞。一条十英尺宽的猫道环绕着十五英尺高的灯笼房，里面放着灯塔的水晶镜片。透镜懒洋洋地转动着，但它不是在发光，而是散发出一种冰冷的阴影。灯笼房的墙壁是五英尺宽的玻璃板，上面有一扇玻璃门。",

	"The lens no longer grants benefits to undead.": "镜片不再给予不死族好处。",
	"If the characters learned about the lantern's teleporting qualities from Rainbow on the fourth floor, it's a simple matter to figure out how the lens works. If they didn't learn that information, they can note that the lens continues to pulse with magic even after its necromantic corruption is expunged. An {@spell identify} spell, or a few minutes of study by a character with proficiency in {@skill Arcana} or who uses {@spell detect magic}, reveals not only evocation magic within the lens (used to produce the magical light), but conjuration magic tied to teleportation.": "如果人物从四楼的Rainbow那里了解到灯笼的传送特性，那么弄清透镜的工作原理就很简单了。如果他们没有学到这些信息，他们可以注意到，即使在死灵的腐化被清除之后，透镜仍会继续发出魔法的脉冲。一个{@spell identify}的法术，或者一个精通{@skill Arcana}或使用{@spell detect magic}的人物研究几分钟，不仅可以发现透镜中的唤醒魔法（用于产生魔光），还可以发现与传送相关的魔法。",
	"The original builder of the lighthouse was a kindly old wizard who enjoyed the romantic idea of living rustic by the sea in his final years. He wanted a laboratory inaccessible to the prying eyes and wandering feet of normal folk. He therefore created the magic lens that allowed him to teleport directly from the top of the lighthouse to his underground workshop.": "灯塔的最初建造者是一位善良的老巫师，他喜欢在最后的岁月里在海边过着质朴的生活的浪漫想法。他希望有一个实验室，让普通人的窥视和游荡的脚步无法进入。因此，他创造了魔法透镜，使他能够直接从灯塔的顶部传送到他的地下工作室。",
	"When the Order of the Stout Half-Pint took over the abandoned lighthouse two years ago, Wizzy quickly discovered the teleporting power of the lens. However, renovating the disused basement laboratory had long remained just another item on the franchise's to-do list, and no one ever discovered the super-secret basement beyond.": "两年前，当斯道特半品脱骑士团接管了这座废弃的灯塔时，威兹很快发现了透镜的传送能力。然而，翻新废弃的地下室实验室长期以来一直只是特许经营名单上的另一个项目，没有人发现地下室以外的超级秘密。",
	"After Hoobur Gran'Shoop led his undead minions in the attack on the lighthouse, the gnome archmage used the teleporting lens to inspect the secret basement laboratory, and soon discovered the super-secret basement beyond. Though he didn't explore the super-secret basement, he was delighted to find that most of the equipment he needed to do his work (minus the victims) was already set up for him in the lab. The place was even dark and dreary, just the way he liked it. Not wanting to pass up an incredible opportunity, the archmage decided to make the Silent Sound lighthouse his new home.": "在胡伯-格兰肖普率领他的亡灵爪牙攻击灯塔后，地精大法师用传送镜检查了地下室的秘密实验室，并很快发现了地下室之外的超级秘密。虽然他没有探索这个超级机密的地下室，但他很高兴地发现，他工作所需的大部分设备（除去受害者）都已经在实验室里为他准备好了。这个地方甚至是黑暗和沉闷的，正是他喜欢的方式。大法师不想放弃一个不可思议的机会，他决定把静音灯塔作为他的新家。",
	"During his attack on the lighthouse, Hoobur made sure that his troops captured rather than killed Wizzy Fotz, the gnome leader of the Order of the Stout Half-Pint. When the tiefling Talanatha appeared out of nowhere in her flight from the attack on Tresendar Manor, Hoobur's minions took her alive as well. He later brought these two prisoners to his lab and has been performing magical rites on them, draining their vitality and will to keep them in a state between life and death.": "在进攻灯塔的过程中，胡伯尔确保他的部队抓到了而不是杀死了威兹-福茨，他是粗粮半品脱骑士团的地精领袖。当铁皮人塔拉纳塔在逃离对特伦达庄园的攻击时突然出现，胡伯的部下也把她活捉了。后来他把这两个囚犯带到了他的实验室，一直在对他们进行魔法仪式，耗尽他们的生命力和意志，使他们处于生死之间。",

	"A blinding flash leaves an indelible mark in your brain as you step into the lens. When your vision clears, you find yourselves in the corner of a stone chamber filled with laboratory and arcane equipment. Tall bookcases filled with tomes line two walls, while the other walls feature long tables covered with alembics, flasks, cauldrons, beakers, and containers holding weird reagents and components. An iron cage is set against one wall, its door open.": "当你踏入镜头时，一道刺眼的闪光在你的大脑中留下了不可磨灭的印记。当你的视线清晰时，你发现自己在一个充满实验室和奥术设备的石室的角落里。高大的书柜里装满了书籍，在两面墙上排列着，而其他墙上则摆放着长长的桌子，上面布满了酒杯、烧瓶、大锅、烧杯，以及装着奇怪试剂和成分的容器。一个铁笼子靠着一面墙，笼子的门开着。",
	"Two more tables surrounded by chairs stand in the center of the room. The first contains a variety of humanoid body parts, all on the small side. The second table holds a tiefling restrained with leather straps. She struggles against the bonds with a wild look on her face.": "房间中央还有两张被椅子包围的桌子。第一张桌子上摆放着各种人形的身体部位，都是小的一面。第二张桌子上放着一个被皮筋束缚的铁皮人。她挣扎着反抗束缚，脸上带着狂热的表情。",
	"Standing near the tiefling's table is an odd-looking construct with an even more oddly placed spigot at the base of its barrel-shaped body. A gnome dressed in garishly colorful clothes sits on a stool nearby, his eyes blank. Another gnome sits next to the first, but this one is most lively and chipper. He wears dark robes and a red fez bearing the Dran Enterprises logo—apparently scrawled in white chalk.": "站在铁弗林的桌子旁边的是一个看起来很奇怪的建筑，它的桶状身体底部有一个更奇怪的水龙头。一个穿着花花绿绿的地精坐在旁边的凳子上，眼神空洞。另一个地精坐在第一个地精的旁边，但这个地精最活泼、最爽快。他穿着深色长袍，戴着印有德兰企业标志的红色头巾--显然是用白色粉笔涂抹的。",
	"\"See Wizzy?\" the chipper gnome says to the other. \"I told you we would have visitors. I felt their presence in the lantern room.\" He sips from a cup of tea as he beckons to you. \"Would you like to have a seat? And can I get you some chamomile tea? My name is Hoobur Gran'Shoop, by the way. Pleased to meet you.\"": "\"看到Wizzy了吗？\"这个活泼的地精对另一个人说。\"我告诉过你我们会有访客。我在灯笼房里感觉到他们的存在。\" 他一边喝着茶一边向你招手。\"你想坐下来吗？要不要给你拿点甘菊茶？顺便说一下，我的名字是胡伯-格兰肖普。很高兴见到你。\"",
	"Necromancy as a business model needs more discussion, I think. Who hasn't had that fantasy about having all undead employees? No? Just me? Okay.": "我认为，作为一种商业模式，Necromancy需要更多的讨论。谁没有过那种拥有所有不死员工的幻想？没有吗？只有我吗？好吧。",
	"Hoobur Gran'Shoop is a far more powerful foe than the characters can handle at their current level. Fortunately, he doesn't want to kill them. In fact, the archmage is a big fan of the plucky, can-do attitude that's brought them this far. He was hired—and given a great deal of magic and money—by the Six to wipe out a couple of Acquisitions Incorporated franchises, here and at Tresendar Manor. His instructions were to make it look like Dran Enterprises was responsible. Other than that, he has no dog in this fight.": "胡伯-格兰肖普是一个远比人物目前的水平所能应付的更强大的敌人。幸运的是，他并不想杀死他们。事实上，这位大法师非常喜欢他们这种勇敢、敢作敢为的态度，这让他们走到了今天。他受雇于六人帮，并得到了大量的魔法和金钱，以消灭几个收购公司的特许权，在这里和特伦达庄园。他的指示是要让它看起来像是德兰企业的责任。除此以外，他在这场战斗中没有任何影响力。",
	"Hoobur attempts to establish a sincere dialogue with the characters, chatting about the serenity of the area surrounding the lighthouse, the importance of good friends, the relaxing qualities of a good cup of tea, or any other topic that catches his fancy. During the conversation, he drops as many references to Dran Enterprises as possible, implying that the organization is the characters' true enemy. He reinforces any rumors the characters have heard about Dran Enterprises, or spins those rumors if they haven't. This includes the speculation seen on the map on the lighthouse first floor that Dran Enterprises has a secret headquarters—and thus a sinister presence—in Luskan.": "胡伯试图与人物建立真诚的对话，谈论灯塔周围地区的宁静、好朋友的重要性、一杯好茶的放松特性，或任何其他引起他兴趣的话题。在谈话中，他尽可能多地提到德兰企业，暗示该组织是这些人物的真正敌人。他强化了人物所听到的关于德兰企业的任何传言，如果他们没有听说过，则会转述这些传言。这包括在灯塔一楼的地图上看到的猜测，即德兰企业在卢斯坎有一个秘密总部，因此有一个险恶的存在。",
	"When the talk becomes serious, Hoobur tells the characters he's willing to let them walk away right now, taking Wizzy and Talanatha with them, if they leave him to his work here.

Over time, a similar construct could be used as an offensive upgrade to the franchise's headquarters, either as part of future franchise advancement or with the headquarters modification franchise task.": "如果费力地收集并从地下室取出其部件，一个在{@skill Arcana}方面受过训练的角色可以研究{@creature Mechachimera|OoW|mechachimera's}的设计。随着时间的推移，类似的构造可以作为特许经营总部的进攻性升级，作为未来特许经营推进的一部分，或者与总部改造特许经营任务一起。",
	"Having a small castle estate in Phandalin is cool. But having a lighthouse on the Sword Coast might be even cooler. If it seems like the thing to do, the characters could use the franchise restructuring or headquarters modification activities to officially ask permission to relocate their franchise to the Silent Sound lighthouse. (This assumes that Hoobur Gran'Shoop was driven from the basement, and that the characters are prepared to deal with the possibility of him coming back.)": "在潘达林拥有一个小城堡庄园是很酷的。但在剑海岸有一座灯塔可能更酷。如果这看起来是件好事，角色们可以利用特许经营权的重组或总部改造活动，正式请求允许将他们的特许经营权搬迁到寂静之声灯塔。 (这是假设胡伯-格兰肖普被从地下室赶走了，而且角色们准备应对他回来的可能性)。",
	"Even if the characters don't want to officially change territories, nothing prevents them from quietly checking out the commercial landscape in the area. Characters searching the sea caves along the cliffs near the lighthouse might find that a variety of ne'er-do-wells use them as places to hide from naval pursuers, stow contraband, secure prisoners held for ransom, and engage in other nefarious activities. Joining in on (or getting a percentage of) such activities could be set up with the shady business practice activity—possibly connecting to any deal the characters have recently struck with the newly installed captain of a fast ship.": "即使人物不想正式改变领土，也不妨碍他们悄悄地查看该地区的商业景观。搜索灯塔附近悬崖上的海洞的角色可能会发现，各种新的恶棍把它们当作躲避海军追捕者的地方，藏匿违禁品，保护被劫持的囚犯，以及从事其他邪恶的活动。加入（或获得一定比例的）此类活动可以与不正当的商业行为活动联系起来--可能与人物最近与新上任的快船船长达成的任何交易有关。",
	"Characters not wanting to flout the law (or at least not to do so outside their own territory) could instead clear out smugglers and other riffraff along the coast. Doing so as part of a philanthropic enterprise could get them in good with the authorities in Neverwinter or Luskan.": "不想藐视法律的角色（或至少不想在自己的领土之外这样做），可以在沿海地区清除走私者和其他暴徒。作为慈善事业的一部分，这样做可以使他们与永夜城或卢斯坎的当局保持良好关系。",
	"Taking over the lighthouse also provides the opportunity for a philanthropic enterprise. The light is a warning beacon for ships traveling the coast between Neverwinter and Luskan, but it needs someone to keep it running. Before the Order of the Stout Half-Pint moved in, the authorities in Luskan and Neverwinter struggled to entice anyone to live at the remote lighthouse, given the amount of dangerous bandit and pirate activity in the area. If the characters take over the lighthouse or arrange for it to be staffed, they'll earn the favor of Neverwinter, Luskan, and possibly even the Lords' Alliance for their generosity.": "接管灯塔也为慈善事业的发展提供了机会。这盏灯是行驶在永温特和卢斯坎之间海岸的船只的警示灯，但它需要有人来维持它的运行。在Stout Half-Pint骑士团进驻之前，鉴于该地区有大量危险的强盗和海盗活动，Luskan和Neverwinter的当局很难吸引任何人住在这个偏远的灯塔。如果角色们接管了灯塔，或者安排了工作人员，他们会因为自己的慷慨而赢得永夜、卢斯坎，甚至可能是领主联盟的青睐。",
	"While the characters are engaged in downtime and franchise activities, Omin Dran makes contact. He embraces the characters' reports from Phandalin and the Silent Sound lighthouse as proof that Dran Enterprises is involved in the attacks against Acq Inc franchises, and that its agents are willing to kill to claim the components of the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}. However, something about that approach feels inconsistent with Dran Enterprises' normal approach to acquisition. A ruthless attitude and wanting Acquisitions Incorporated taken apart and absorbed into its own corporate space is one thing, but doing it one franchise at a time seems odd. As such, Omin wants more information before committing to reprisals or confrontation.": "当这些人物在进行停工和特许经营活动时，奥明-德兰进行了联系。他接受了人物从范达林和寂静之声灯塔的报告，证明德兰企业参与了对Acq公司加盟店的攻击，而且其代理人愿意杀人以索取{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}的组件。然而，这种做法让人感觉与德兰企业的正常收购方式不一致。无情的态度和希望收购公司被拆开并吸收到自己的公司空间是一回事，但一次做一个加盟店似乎很奇怪。因此，奥明希望在致力于报复或对抗之前获得更多信息。",
	"The characters are directed to go to Luskan to confirm that Dran Enterprises has a secret headquarters in that lawless city. If they do, they then need to find and infiltrate the operation, learning as much as they can about the plans of Acquisitions Incorporated's biggest business rival!": "人物被指示去卢斯坎确认德兰企业在那个无法无天的城市有一个秘密总部。如果是这样，他们就需要找到并渗透到行动中去，尽可能多地了解收购公司最大的商业对手的计划!",
	"The search for the headquarters takes the characters first to the rough-and-tumble Fishbone Tavern, then to Arla Razortongue, a disgruntled Dran Enterprises ex-employee running a well-known peg and hook shop. After dealing with thugs sent to quiet Arla, the characters learn the location of Dran Enterprises' secret headquarters, and can plan their infiltration.": "在寻找总部的过程中，角色们首先来到了粗犷的鱼骨酒馆，然后找到了Arla Razortongue，一个心怀不满的德兰企业前雇员，经营着一家著名的钉子和钩子店。在与被派来镇压阿拉的暴徒打交道后，角色们得知了德兰企业秘密总部的位置，并可以计划他们的潜入行动。",
	"That headquarters is a seemingly small and unimportant ship at the Luskan docks. But Dran Enterprises' magic has filled the ship with portals leading to some of the faction's many franchises, ships, and business locations. When the characters visit, those portals lead to:": "那个总部是在卢斯坎码头的一艘看起来很小、不重要的船。但德兰企业的魔法使这艘船充满了门户，通向该派系的许多特许经营权、船只和商业地点。当人物访问时，这些门户会通往。",
	"A dead ship being consumed by the power of the Far Realm—which quickly threatens to consume the characters as well.": "一艘死船被远界的力量所吞噬--它很快就威胁到了人物的消耗。",
	"A faction warehouse whose overworked attendant will help them only if they help her.": "一个派别仓库，只有当他们帮助她时，其过度劳累的服务员才会帮助他们。",

	"Only by traveling through a sufficient number of these portals can the characters key themselves to activating the portal to Dran Enterprises' true headquarters—a palatial ship named {@i The Maverick}. There, they are met by a Dran Enterprises operative who is aware of their quest, and who informs them that Dran Enterprises in fact has nothing to do with the attacks against the two Acquisitions Incorporated franchises. Moreover, Dran Enterprises is also aware of the dark power of the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}—and its operatives have collected two of the orrery's components, hoping to keep that power in check. But the characters are not alone as they seek this information. Operatives of the Six are already within the portal network, and are racing to claim the orrery components collected by Dran Enterprises before the characters do.": "只有通过足够数量的这些传送门，角色们才能启动通往德兰企业真正总部的传送门--一艘名为{@i The Maverick}的豪华飞船。在那里，他们遇到了一位知道他们任务的德兰企业特工，他告诉他们，德兰企业实际上与针对两家收购公司特许经营权的攻击毫无关系。此外，德兰企业也意识到了{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}的黑暗力量--它的特工人员已经收集了桔梗的两个部件，希望能够控制住这种力量。但这些人物在寻找这些信息时并不孤单。六人帮的特工已经进入了传送门网络，并且正在争先恐后地抢在人物之前夺取德兰企业收集的ORRERY组件。",
	"The City of Sails is located far to the north of the Sword Coast, and the journey there can be as eventful as you desire. If the players are hankering for random encounters, the wild lands of the North can certainly oblige them. Or you might wish to have the journey pass in relative peace while the players coordinate franchise tasks left over from the previous episode.": "帆之城位于剑海岸的北部，去那里的旅程可以按照你的愿望多姿多彩。如果玩家渴望随机遭遇，北方的荒野之地肯定能满足他们的要求。或者，你可能希望让旅程在相对平静中度过，而玩家则协调前一集留下的特许任务。",
	"Luskan rests upon stone escarpments on either side of the icy River Mirar. Three bridges, named Upstream Span, Dalath's Span, and Long Span, cross forty feet above the river to connect the two sides of the city.

As they seek out Dran Enterprises' secret headquarters, the characters start in the south and work their way to the Open Shore docks.": "卢斯坎坐落在冰冷的米拉河两岸的石质悬崖峭壁上。三座桥被命名为 \"上游跨度\"、\"达拉斯跨度 \"和 \"长跨度\"，横跨河面40英尺，连接城市的两边。开放海岸的码头位于河的最北端，而龙滩的码头在南边。当他们寻找德兰企业的秘密总部时，角色们从南部开始，一路走到开阔海岸的码头。",
	"A key aspect of Luskan life is its rule by groups known as Ships. Five High Captains each rule a Ship made up of pirates and other Northlanders. Ship Kurth, under High Captain Beniago Kurth, is the First Ship, which controls the city's docks and trade. Ship Baram is the Second Ship, operating the fishing industry. Third Ship Suljack leads piracy and raiding, handing down less-desirable opportunities to Fourth Ship Taerl. Fifth Ship Rethnor acts as the city's guard—an unprofitable enough duty that many of its members look for other ways to earn coin.": "卢斯坎生活的一个重要方面是由被称为 \"船 \"的团体统治。五位高级船长各自统治一艘由海盗和其他北地人组成的船。由高级船长Beniago Kurth领导的Kurth号是第一艘船，它控制着城市的码头和贸易。巴拉姆号是第二艘船，经营捕鱼业。三号船Suljack领导海盗和袭击，将不太理想的机会交给四号船Taerl。第五艘船Rethnor作为城市的卫队--这是一项无利可图的职责，许多成员都在寻找其他方式来赚取硬币。",
	"The order of mages known as the Arcane Brotherhood is the other major power group in Luskan.

	"The characters' main goal in this episode is to find Dran Enterprises' secret headquarters. However, owing to that organization's habit of breaking the legs of anyone who talks about company business, this information is hard to come by. Thankfully, the characters are able to learn that Dran Enterprises employees often frequent a specific tavern in Luskan, giving them a starting point for seeking the information they need.": "本集人物的主要目标是找到德兰企业的秘密总部。然而，由于该组织习惯于打断任何谈论公司业务的人的腿，这一信息很难得到。值得庆幸的是，角色们能够了解到德兰企业的员工经常光顾卢斯坎的一个特定酒馆，这给了他们一个寻求所需信息的起点。",
	"The characters can learn the name and location of the Fishbone tavern in any number of ways, including talking to other tavern owners, seeking out merchants and mercenaries who've done business with Dran Enterprises, and the like. Two example encounters are provided to help the characters find the tavern.

	"A sharp, icy wind whistles through South Gate as you enter Luskan. The shops and taverns lining the main thoroughfare of the City of Sails are as battered and weathered as the grim customers entering them. At first glance, the city's reputation as a den for pirates and raiders appears well earned.": "当你进入卢斯坎时，一股尖锐的冰冷的风呼啸着穿过南门。沿着风帆之城的主干道的商店和酒馆，就像进入它们的严峻的顾客一样，都是破烂不堪，饱经风霜。乍一看，这座城市作为海盗和掠夺者的巢穴的名声似乎很好。",
	"Just ahead of you, a wagon has broken down in front of a tavern. The elderly human driver calls out for help, but passersby ignore her. As she calls out once more, the tavern door behind her opens and two guards toss a young male human in bright clothing out into the street. He tumbles into the old woman, sending both of them sprawling to the ground. The door closes, then opens once more as a mandolin comes flying out of the tavern.": "就在你的前面，一辆马车在一家酒馆前抛锚了。年长的人类车夫大声呼救，但路人都没有理会她。当她再次呼喊时，她身后的酒馆门打开了，两个卫兵把一个穿着鲜艳衣服的年轻男性人类扔到了街上。他翻滚着撞向老妇人，把他们两个人都撞倒在地。门关上了，然后再一次打开，一个曼陀林从酒馆里飞出来。",
	"If the characters want to lend a hand, they have ample opportunity to step up.

	"At some point before the party arrives in Luskan, ask the players whether their characters are bringing the orrery housing and any components with them, and if so, who carries the relics. If they plan instead to secure them elsewhere, ask about that location and their security measures. For the purpose of the adventure, it's best if the characters keep the orrery components with them, rather than leaving them at headquarters. (Certainly, reminding the characters of what happened to the last two franchise headquarters that held orrery components should be enough to inspire them to hold onto the components themselves.)": "在队伍到达卢斯坎之前的某个时候，询问玩家他们的角色是否会带着兽皮箱和任何部件，如果是的话，谁会携带这些遗物。如果他们打算在其他地方保护这些东西，请询问那个地方和他们的安全措施。为了冒险的目的，最好是让角色们把神庙部件带在身边，而不是把它们留在总部。(当然，提醒角色们注意前两个持有桔梗组件的特许经营总部的情况，应该足以激励他们自己保管这些组件）。",

	"As long as they're in Luskan, the characters might take the opportunity to try to extend their franchise's reach into the city. A formal presence in this far-flung territory is far beyond the scope of their charter of operations, naturally. And savvy franchisees might have heard rumors that Head Office is working to open a franchise in the City of Sails. However, clever players could work to increase their own franchise's notoriety and add a few more customers without unduly violating the terms of their contract. You might tie such attempts to future franchise tasks or downtime incorporating the shady business practice activity, as the characters try to keep an official distance from any Luskan opportunities.": "只要他们在卢斯坎，这些人物可能会利用这个机会尝试将他们的特许经营权延伸到这个城市。在这块遥远的土地上的正式存在，自然远远超出了他们的经营章程的范围。精明的加盟商可能已经听说了总部正在努力在风帆之城开设加盟店的传闻。然而，聪明的玩家可以在不过度违反合同条款的情况下，努力提高自己加盟店的知名度，增加一些客户。你可以把这种尝试与未来的特许经营任务或停工期联系起来，将黑幕商业行为活动纳入其中，因为角色们试图与任何卢斯坎的机会保持官方距离。",
	"Dabahl cannot afford the repairs or offer to pay the characters for their service, but in her gratitude, she can share that Dran Enterprises has a nefarious reputation. The location of their headquarters is a closely guarded secret, but the organization's employees are said to favor a tavern frequented by fishers. Dabahl sells her goods to Ship Kurth and could also introduce the characters to its merchants, though she does not have any influence with them.": "达巴尔负担不起修理费，也不愿意为这些人物的服务支付报酬，但为了表示感谢，她可以分享德兰企业的恶名。他们总部的位置是一个严密的秘密，但据说该组织的员工喜欢一个渔民经常光顾的小酒馆。达波尔向库尔兹船出售她的货物，也可以把人物介绍给其商人，尽管她对他们没有任何影响力。",
	"If the characters stay on her good side, Eriss confides that she doesn't know where Dran Enterprises has its headquarters. However, she can share that the employees of the organization sometimes gather at a watering hole known as Fishbone Tavern. They keep a low profile, but the tavern's bartender, Fryer, might be able to identify a member of Dran Enterprises or help the characters further.": "如果角色保持在她的好的一面，艾莉丝坦白说，她不知道德兰企业的总部在哪里。不过，她可以告诉大家，该组织的员工有时会聚集在一个名为 \"鱼骨酒馆 \"的饮品店。他们保持低调，但酒馆的酒保弗莱尔可能会认出德兰企业的成员或进一步帮助这些人物。",
	"NPC scenes can encourage cooperative roleplaying, so give the players lots of space to discuss how to help characters like Noriel and Dabahl—and then run with the players' ideas. A desire to help Noriel could lead to helping the bard land a paying gig at a tavern, or seeking out one of the Ships or the loremasters of the Arcane Brotherhood to learn of his father. Helping Dabahl could lead to an encounter with a guild of teamsters or a disgruntled repair shop employee. Such efforts could lead to additional roleplaying scenarios, to which you can add ability checks and combat encounters as desired.": "NPC场景可以鼓励合作性的角色扮演，所以给玩家很多空间来讨论如何帮助像诺里尔和达巴尔这样的角色--然后按照玩家的想法去做。帮助诺瑞尔的愿望可能会导致帮助吟游诗人在酒馆找到一份有报酬的工作，或者寻找船主或奥术兄弟会的会长来了解他的父亲。帮助Dabahl可能会导致他遇到一个团队成员公会或一个心怀不满的修理厂雇员。这种努力可能会导致更多的角色扮演场景，你可以根据需要增加能力检查和战斗遭遇。",
	"Of course, some players will simply ignore Dabahl and Noriel. That's okay. Let the characters' reactions take things in a different direction, and have a different NPC provide the same information. However, always feel free to have Dabahl or Noriel make another appearance. Maybe the two team up, with Noriel helping improvise the repairs (soon to fail at any time), while Dabahl teaches Noriel a song or two. Their story can move forward, intersecting with the party's story at a later opportune moment.": "当然，有些玩家会直接无视达巴尔和诺利尔。这也没关系。让人物的反应把事情引向不同的方向，让不同的NPC提供相同的信息。然而，请随时让达巴尔或诺里尔再次出场。也许两人合作，Noriel帮助即兴修理（很快就会失败），而Dabahl教Noriel唱一两首歌。他们的故事可以向前推进，在以后一个合适的时刻与党的故事相交。",
	"Any fisher or laborer in the north of the city can provide directions to Fishbone Tavern. None of the NPCs currently at the tavern know the location of Dran Enterprises headquarters, but they can provide pointers to someone who does.": "城北的任何渔夫或工人都可以提供去鱼骨酒馆的路线。目前在酒馆的NPC都不知道德兰企业总部的位置，但他们可以为知道的人提供指点。",
	"Fishbone Tavern is located a few blocks from Luskan's Open Shore docks, close enough that you can smell the sea air and hear the cries of gulls swooping over the fishing ships. A few lazy snowflakes fall from a cloudy sky as you approach the tavern's front entrance—and a sign decorated with an actual rotting fish nailed to a board bearing the tavern's name. Standing before the door is an immense figure who beams a smile missing most of its teeth. He squints his eyes as if trying to make sense of you. \"What... uh... what's your business here?\"": "鱼骨酒馆距离卢斯坎的开阔海岸码头只有几个街区，近到你可以闻到海风，听到海鸥在渔船上俯冲的叫声。当你走近酒馆的前门时，几片懒洋洋的雪花从阴云密布的天空中飘落下来，还有一个用一条真正的腐烂的鱼钉在写有酒馆名称的木板上的标志。站在门前的是一个巨大的身影，他露出了缺了大部分牙齿的笑容。他眯起眼睛，似乎想弄明白你的意思。\"什么......呃......你在这里有什么事？\"",
	"Zurb knows (and absolutely shouldn't share but does) that employees of Dran Enterprises drink at the Fishbone frequently, though he hasn't seen any of them in a few days. He ponders a while on how that's rather unusual. Zurb can suggest the characters talk to Fryer the bartender to figure out why. (She earned that name when she hit a would-be-thief with a searing-hot frying pan.) Zurb can also describe any of the tavern's regulars, including warning the characters that Rakeem can't be trusted.": "祖尔布知道（绝对不应该分享，但确实知道），德兰企业的员工经常在鱼骨酒吧喝酒，尽管他已经有几天没有看到他们中的任何一个。他思索了一会儿，认为这很不寻常。祖尔布可以建议人物与酒保弗莱尔谈谈，以弄清原因。(她是在用灼热的煎锅打了一个小偷之后才得到这个名字的）。Zurb还可以描述酒馆的任何一个常客，包括警告人物Rakeem是不可信任的。",
	"When the characters decide to enter, Zurb opens the door for them. If the characters have befriended him, Zurb announces them as \"really nice people that talked a lot.\" This causes Fryer to shake her head in weary disbelief.": "当这些人物决定进入时，祖尔布为他们开门。如果这些人物与他交好，祖尔布就宣布他们是 \"非常好的人，说了很多话\"。这导致弗莱尔疲惫地摇头表示不相信。",
	"The interior of the Fishbone Tavern is cramped and shadowy. Only two of the eight tables are occupied, one by two fishers and another by a lone figure in a dark, leather-patched cloak. One wall holds a small, smoky fireplace, while a long bar of dark-stained wood stands along the opposite wall. Standing behind the bar under oval plaques set with yellowing fish skeletons is a heavyset human bartender. She pours ale for a half-elf seated at the bar, quietly engaging him in conversation.": "鱼骨酒馆的内部很拥挤，很阴暗。八张桌子中只有两张有人，一张是两个渔夫，另一张是一个身穿深色皮制斗篷的孤独人物。一面墙上有一个冒烟的小壁炉，而对面墙上则有一个长长的黑漆木条。站在吧台后面的椭圆形牌子下，镶嵌着发黄的鱼骨架，是一个身材魁梧的人类酒保。她为坐在吧台前的一个半精灵倒酒，悄悄地与他交谈。",
	"Although Fryer is tight with Dran Enterprises, she carries a certain amount of guilt over an incident from a few months ago. She reported a former friend and Dran Enterprises operative named Arla Razortongue to her bosses for speaking out about the organization's unethical practices. (See \"The Peg and Hook\" below for more on Arla.) Recent word on the street is that Arla continues to be a thorn in Dran Enterprises' side—and that she's been marked for exile or elimination. A character might sense Fryer's remorse over having sold Arla out with a successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check, and could encourage her to share what took place and where to find Arla with appropriate roleplaying.": "虽然弗莱尔与德兰企业关系密切，但她对几个月前的一个事件怀有一定的愧疚。她向她的老板举报了一个前朋友和德兰企业的特工，名叫阿拉-拉佐通格（Arla Razortongue），因为她说出了该组织的不道德行为。(最近有消息称，Arla仍然是德兰企业的眼中钉，她已经被标记为流放或淘汰。一个角色可以通过成功的DC12智慧({@skill Insight})检查感觉到Fryer对出卖Arla的悔恨，并可以通过适当的角色扮演鼓励她分享发生的事情以及在哪里可以找到Arla。",
	"Word on the street is that Dran Enterprises has \"turtled up,\" retreating into wherever they hide due to some trouble known to the company's higher-ups. Rakeem doesn't know what that trouble is, but one person who keeps her ear to the ground about Dran Enterprises is Arla at the Peg and Hook ({@area see below|1ba|x}). He can share Arla's story and provide directions to her shop.": "有消息说，德兰企业已经 \"龟缩 \"了，由于公司高层知道的一些麻烦，他们躲到了哪里。拉基姆不知道那是什么麻烦，但有一个人对德兰企业的情况一直很关注，那就是Peg and Hook（{@area see below|1ba|x}）的Arla。他可以分享Arla的故事，并提供去她店里的路线。",
	"If the characters help Velos and mention their interest in Dran Enterprises, he shares that he recently overheard a melancholy employee talking about how a friend \"got invited to headquarters but accidentally took a wrong door. They managed to scoop up what was left of him.\" His gratitude also makes him a solid potential hire, especially if the franchise has future business in Luskan.": "如果人物帮助维洛斯并提到他们对德兰企业的兴趣，他分享说他最近无意中听到一个忧郁的员工谈论一个朋友如何 \"被邀请去总部，但不小心走错了门。他们设法把他剩下的东西挖了出来\"。他的感激之情也使他成为一个可靠的潜在雇员，特别是如果特许经营在卢斯坎有未来的业务。",
	"Once the characters have learned about Arla from any of the possible sources at the Fishbone, they can travel to her shop.": "一旦人物从鱼骨的任何一个可能的来源了解到Arla，他们就可以前往她的商店。",
	"Arla Razortongue (CG female human {@creature spy} with iconic Dran Enterprises employee features; see \"{@book Iconic Faction Features|AI|4|Iconic Faction Features}\" in {@book appendix B|AI|4}) had a good thing going as an employee of Dran Enterprises. So when she was fired from that organization, the need to start over again in the cutthroat environs of Luskan inspired her to think outside the box. Way, way outside. Given the number of seedy sailors that call the City of Sails their home port, she knew that a shop helping pirates with limb replacements would always make money. However, she felt that a hook was more useful as a replacement for a leg (instead of the traditional peg leg), and that a peg was more useful to replace a lost hand.": "Arla Razortongue（CG女性人类{@creature spy}，具有德兰企业员工的标志性特征；见{@book appendix B|AI|4}中的\"{@book Iconic Faction Features|AI|4|Iconic Faction Features}\"）作为德兰企业的员工，她有一个好的发展。因此，当她被那个组织解雇后，在卢斯坎这个残酷的环境中重新开始的需要激发了她的思维。非常，非常的超脱。鉴于把风帆之城作为母港的肮脏水手的数量，她知道，帮助海盗更换肢体的商店总是会赚钱的。然而，她觉得钩子作为腿的替代品更有用（而不是传统的钉子腿），而钉子对于替代失去的手更有用。",
	"Dran Enterprises ignored Arla at first, convinced that she would be a failure. Surprisingly, though, the plucky entrepreneur managed to convince enough pirates to try out her unconventional system that her business thrived. She has since developed a number of unique attachments (hook shoes, peg arm accessories) that provide surprising functionality—and even replaced one of her own hands and a leg to prove her point.": "德兰企业一开始没有理会阿拉，认为她会是一个失败者。但令人惊讶的是，这位勇敢的企业家成功地说服了足够多的海盗尝试她的非常规系统，使她的生意兴隆起来。此后，她开发了许多独特的附件（钩子鞋、钉子臂配件），提供了令人惊讶的功能--甚至替换了她自己的一只手和一条腿来证明她的观点。",
	"When the characters approach the Peg and Hook, first decide whether their previous investigation has alerted Dran Enterprises. If they allowed Rakeem to eavesdrop and report their conversations, alerted Eriss the broker of their antagonistic intentions, or asked too many strangers how to find the organization, a strike team is already inside the shop and attacking Arla. Go straight to \"{@area Dran Strike Team|1c0|x}\" below and roll for initiative.": "当人物接近Peg和Hook时，首先要决定他们之前的调查是否已经惊动了德兰企业。如果他们允许Rakeem偷听并报告他们的谈话，提醒经纪人Eriss他们的敌对意图，或者问了太多的陌生人如何找到这个组织，那么一支突击队已经在商店里面，并且正在攻击Arla。直接进入下面的\"{@area Dran Strike Team|1c0|x}\"，然后掷出主动权。",
	"If the characters were discreet in their inquiries, Arla is alone in her shop and can be approached in any way they want. Then run the \"{@area Dran Strike Team|1c0|x}\" encounter as the characters prepare to leave the shop.": "如果角色们在询问时很谨慎，Arla独自在她的商店里，可以以任何方式接近她。然后在人物准备离开商店时，执行\"{@area Dran Strike Team|1c0|x} \"遭遇战。",
	"Arla initially assumes the characters are customers, and points out various arm peg accessories, hook foot options, and other products she has developed. She then whips out a bone saw and asks which of the characters she can help first.": "阿拉最初以为这些人物是顾客，并指出了各种臂钉配件、钩脚选项和她开发的其他产品。然后，她拿出一把骨锯，问哪个人物她可以先帮忙。",
	"When she realizes the characters aren't customers, Arla is disappointed, but she's open to their questions. She despises Dran Enterprises, and is willing to help anyone who opposes that organization. Conveniently (for her), she's also looking for investors to help her expand her burgeoning business. She initially asks for 1,000 gp for her information, or half as much if the characters bring her a paying customer. She can be talked down to 500 gp, or 250 gp with one customer.": "当她意识到这些人物不是顾客时，Arla很失望，但她对他们的问题持开放态度。她鄙视德兰企业，并愿意帮助任何反对该组织的人。方便的是（对她来说），她也在寻找投资者，以帮助她扩大她的蓬勃发展的业务。她最初要求提供1000金币的信息，如果人物能给她带来一个付费的客户，则可得到一半的金币。她可以被说服到500戈比，或者250戈比，只要有一个顾客。",
	"A tiny and unassuming ship named {@i Dangerous Business} is always moored at the Open Shore docks, and is more than it appears. The ship houses a series of magic portals leading to various Dran Enterprises warehouses, ships, marketplaces—and to {@i The Maverick} itself. Each of {@i Dangerous Business}'s magic portals is set with and activated by a differently shaped and colored stone. Employees memorize where each stone leads, but the configuration changes on a regular schedule. Moreover, employees are subject to enchantment magic that prevents them from sharing the information. Arla does not know the current portal configuration.": "一艘名为{@i Dangerous Business}的不起眼的小船总是停泊在开阔海岸码头，而且比它的外表更有意义。这艘船有一系列的魔法门，通往德兰企业的各个仓库、船只、市场--以及{@i The Maverick}本身。每一个{@i Dangerous Business}的魔法门都镶嵌着不同形状和颜色的石头，并由其激活。员工们记住了每块石头的位置，但配置会定期改变。此外，员工还受到魔法的影响，无法分享信息。Arla不知道当前的门户配置。",
	"As the characters rise in level and franchise rank, NPCs will begin to take notice of them, and not just vice versa. Rather than the adventurers constantly thinking about which NPCs might make solid prospective business partners, those NPCs might start showing up later in the adventure to pitch the franchise on commercial deals. Keep note of which NPCs the players have the most fun interacting with, and keep those NPCs in mind for future engagement. Conversely, the NPCs the players most actively dislike could become foes, joining Dran Enterprises or the Six, then appearing later in the campaign to pay the characters back for some real or imagined slight.": "随着人物等级和特许经营权等级的提高，NPC会开始注意到他们，而不仅仅是反过来。与其让冒险者不断考虑哪些NPC可能成为可靠的潜在商业伙伴，不如让这些NPC在冒险后期开始出现，向特许经营商推销商业交易。记下玩家与哪些NPC的互动最有趣，并将这些NPC牢记在心，以便将来接触。相反，玩家最不喜欢的NPC可能会成为敌人，加入德兰企业或六人帮，然后在活动后期出现，为某些真实的或想象中的轻视行为向角色进行报复。",
	"The team's primary objective is to convince Arla to abandon her business and leave town. If she won't, they have orders to kill her. Hoffman focuses on attacking Arla, castigating her verbally and physically for being a traitor to Dran Enterprises. In combat, Arla's shortsword attacks take the form of either her sharpened leg hook or a retractable blade attached to her arm peg.": "该小组的首要目标是说服阿尔拉放弃她的生意并离开小镇。如果她不愿意，他们就奉命杀掉她。霍夫曼专注于攻击阿尔拉，用言语和身体来指责她是德兰企业的叛徒。在战斗中，阿拉的短剑攻击采取的形式是她削尖的腿钩或连接在她手臂上的可伸缩刀片。",
	"The strike team members are dressed in fur cloaks and leathers, and their weapons and armor are well maintained. They have the equivalent of a priest's pack and an explorer's pack between them, plus a total of 180 gp.": "突击队成员身着毛皮斗篷和皮革，他们的武器和盔甲都保养得很好。他们之间有相当于一个牧师的背包和一个探险家的背包，另外还有总共180金币。",
	"Map 4.1 shows the layout of the docks where the characters make their initial approach to Dran Enterprises headquarters.": "地图4.1显示了人物最初接近德兰企业总部的码头布局。",
	"As the characters seek an approach to {@i Dangerous Business} and the portals within, they are unaware that they are competing against the Six, who have already infiltrated the ship and are seeking Dran Enterprise's main headquarters aboard {@i The Maverick}. The Six are initially at no more advantage than the characters are in their search for the headquarters, but the characters' actions might tip that balance one way or the other.": "当人物在寻找进入{@i Dangerous Business}和其中的传送门时，他们并不知道他们是在与六人帮竞争，六人帮已经潜入了飞船，并在{@i The Maverick}上寻找德兰企业的主要总部。在寻找总部的过程中，六人组起初并不比角色们更有优势，但角色们的行动可能会使这种平衡发生变化。",
	"During this part of the episode, you'll track a one-off mechanic called \"failure points,\" which are used to represent the race against the Six and determine which side finds the headquarters first. The resolution of that search is described in the \"{@book On Board {@i The Maverick}|AI|7|On Board The Maverick}\" section, but the characters will have opportunities before that to realize they are competing against the Six. When that becomes clear, you can underscore any situation in which the party earns a failure point, letting the players know that accumulating too many points means that the Six will pass through the final portal and arrive at {@i The Maverick} first.": "在这部分剧情中，你将追踪一个名为 \"失败点 \"的一次性机制，它被用来表示与六人帮的竞争，并决定哪一方先找到总部。在\"{@book On Board {@i The Maverick}|AI|7|On Board The Maverick}\"一节中描述了这一搜索的决议，但在此之前，人物会有机会意识到他们正在与六人帮竞争。当这一点变得清晰时，你可以强调任何一方获得失败分数的情况，让玩家知道，积累过多的分数意味着六人组将通过最后的门户，并首先到达{@i The Maverick}。",
	"As always in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, keep an open mind to alternative ways to advance the story, and don't worry if the characters happen to lose an important fight. The face-off against the Dran Enterprises strike team is a tough encounter, and might not go the way the characters expect.": "和收购公司的活动一样，对推进故事的其他方式保持开放的心态，如果人物碰巧输掉了一场重要的战斗，也不要担心。与德兰企业突击队的对决是一场艰难的遭遇战，而且可能不会像人物所期望的那样发展。",
	"If any of the guards see the characters as a threat, they shout out, raising the alarm and imposing one failure point. The alarm alerts all other guards on the docks, and can draw an endless supply of reinforcements from other ships over time. As such, the characters should realize quickly that a stand-up fight will involve more foes than they can handle.": "如果任何一个守卫看到这些角色是一个威胁，他们就会大声喊叫，拉响警报并施加一个失败点。警报声惊动了码头上的所有其他守卫，并且随着时间的推移，可以从其他船只上引来无穷无尽的增援。因此，角色们应该很快意识到，站起来的战斗将涉及更多的敌人，而不是他们能够处理的。",
	"The party can retreat and come back when the heat dies down, but this delay imposes another failure point. Or they can push past any threats to get to {@i Dangerous Business} and the portals within.": "队伍可以撤退，等热度消退后再回来，但这种延迟会带来另一个失败点。或者他们可以越过任何威胁，到达{@i Dangerous Business}和里面的传送门。",
	"When the characters step through into the cabin on {@i Dangerous Business}, read:": "当人物在{@i Dangerous Business}上踏入机舱时，请读。",
	"The small square cabin's interior is far larger than its exterior, opening up as an oval room thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide. Crumpled on the floor before an iron door on the far side of the room, the body of a guard lies in a pool of blood. Standing closed between you and the body, six other oval-shaped iron doors are the only features in the room. Each door has a heavy latch that bears the insignia of Dran Enterprises, but no lock is visible. Above each of the iron doors, a differently shaped and colored glowing stone is set.": "这个小方舱的内部远比它的外部大，打开后是一个长30英尺、宽15英尺的椭圆形房间。在房间远处的一扇铁门前，一名警卫的尸体皱缩在地板上，躺在血泊中。在你和尸体之间，还有六扇椭圆形的铁门是房间里唯一的特征。每扇门都有一个沉重的门闩，上面有德兰企业的徽章，但没有看到锁。在每扇铁门的上方，都镶嵌着一块不同形状和颜色的发光石。",
	"The characters can examine the dead guard or investigate the doors and stones. However, the amount of time they have to do so depends on whether they had other guards in pursuit. If the characters were pursued, give them a round or two to investigate the portal nexus, then have an increasing number of guards burst into the area each round, forcing the characters to enter a portal.": "角色们可以检查死去的卫兵或调查门和石头。但是，他们这样做的时间取决于他们是否有其他卫兵在追赶。如果人物被追捕，给他们一两轮时间来调查传送门节点，然后让越来越多的卫兵每轮都冲进这个区域，迫使人物进入传送门。",
	"If the characters infiltrated the ship without raising the alarm, they have five minutes before they hear a guard patrol approaching. If they leave this area to go back onto the deck of {@i Dangerous Business} for any reason, they immediately attract the attention of nearby guards.": "如果人物潜入船内而没有发出警报，他们在听到警卫巡逻队接近前有5分钟时间。如果他们因为任何原因离开这个区域回到{@i Dangerous Business}的甲板上，他们会立即引起附近守卫的注意。",
	"The dead guard is a male half-orc. Lying on his chest is a black business card bearing unintelligible symbols. More notable is that the unfortunate guard's brain has been removed from his shattered skull. The guard was killed by the mind flayer leading the Six operatives (see \"{@area Portal 4|1e0|x}\" and later for more information). The condition of the guard's head makes it impossible to talk to him with {@spell speak with dead}.": "死去的警卫是一名男性半兽人。躺在他胸前的是一张黑色的名片，上面印有无法理解的符号。更值得注意的是，这个不幸的警卫的大脑已经从他破碎的头骨中被取出。这名警卫是被带领六名特工的心灵杀手杀死的（详情见\"{@area Portal 4|1e0|x} \"及后面的内容）。这名警卫的头部状况使他无法用{@spell speak with dead}与他交谈。",
	"Each of the seven doors has a glowing semiprecious stone above it, carved into a different shape: a green turquoise square, a red feldspar triangle, a white pearl circle, a purple amethyst oval, a blue aquamarine rectangle, a black hematite pentagon, and an orange tiger-eye hexagon. A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals an aura of conjuration on the space beyond each door and on each of the stones.": "七扇门的上方各有一块发光的半宝石，雕刻成不同的形状：绿色的绿松石方形，红色的长石三角形，白色的珍珠圆形，紫色的紫水晶椭圆形，蓝色的海蓝宝石矩形，黑色的赤铁矿五边形，以及橙色的虎眼石六边形。一个{@spell detect magic}的咒语在每扇门外的空间和每块石头上显示出一个魔法的光环。",
	"If the stones are removed, they lose their magical properties but are worth 25 gp each.": "如果这些石头被移走，它们就会失去魔法属性，但每块价值25戈比。",
	"Each portal door leads to a different encounter. Opening any door transports all characters in the portal nexus into the area beyond, with the entrance portal disappearing behind them. The characters must navigate the scene that takes place in the new location, then find an exit portal (another iron door identical to the doors in the nexus) to return to the portal nexus. (Portal 1 is an exception, bringing the characters back automatically.) Eventually, the characters find the portal leading to Dran Enterprises' headquarters in this way.": "每个入口门都通向一个不同的遭遇。打开任何一扇门，都会将传送门节点中的所有角色传送到外面的区域，而入口的传送门则在他们身后消失。角色们必须浏览发生在新地点的场景，然后找到一个出口传送门（另一扇与节点中的门相同的铁门）来返回传送门节点。(传送门1是个例外，会自动把人物带回来。)最终，人物通过这种方式找到了通往德兰企业总部的传送门。",
	"The current destinations of the portals are noted on the Portals table. You can choose encounters you favor, or roll on the table to see where the characters end up, rerolling any locations already visited. For the first three destinations, roll a {@dice d6} to prevent the characters from reaching {@i The Maverick}. For subsequent destinations, roll a {@dice d8}. Alternatively, you can allow the characters to reach the headquarters ship (see \"{@book On Board {@i The Maverick}|AI|7|On Board The Maverick}\" below) any time after they've returned from three other destinations.": "传送门的当前目的地在传送门表上注明。你可以选择你喜欢的遭遇，或者在表格上掷骰子，看看角色最终会去哪里，重掷任何已经去过的地点。对于前三个目的地，掷出{@dice d6}以防止角色到达{@i The Maverick}。对于随后的目的地，掷一个{@dice d8}。另外，你也可以允许角色在从其他三个目的地返回后的任何时候到达总部的飞船（见下文\"{@book On Board {@i The Maverick}|AI|7|On Board The Maverick}\"）。",
	"With the exception of the Far Realm horror, the specific locations of portal encounters are not detailed here. If the characters ask about where they are in any given encounter, or if they're inclined to venture outside the encounter area, the choice of location is up to you.": "除了远界恐怖之外，这里没有详细说明传送门遭遇战的具体位置。如果人物问起他们在任何特定遭遇中的位置，或者他们倾向于在遭遇区域之外冒险，那么地点的选择由你决定。",
	"A month ago, an encounter with operatives of the Six led Dran Enterprises to try to fight that group using its own dark magic. Sadly, that attempt failed, and this portal now remains tied to a pocket dimension channeling the power of the Far Realm. Danger lurks on the other side of the door, whose stone has been marked as off limits for Dran Enterprises employees. If a character opens this door, read:": "一个月前，与 \"六人帮 \"成员的一次遭遇导致德兰企业试图用自己的黑暗魔法来对抗该组织。遗憾的是，这次尝试失败了，这个门户现在仍然与一个输送远界力量的袖珍维度联系在一起。危险潜伏在门的另一边，门上的石头已经被标记为德兰企业员工的禁区。如果一个角色打开这扇门，请阅读。",
	"As the portal opens, a pulse of magic draws you forward. The door vanishes and you stand within an impossible scene. The deck of a ship opens up around you, but the shifting sea to all sides is the color of bruised flesh, roiling beneath a clear sky filled with unfamiliar constellations. Suddenly the door to the ship's main cabin explodes out in a pulse of sickly ethereal light. With a horrid slurping sound, writhing tentacles spill forth through the open doorway and lash toward you.": "当传送门打开时，一股魔法的脉冲吸引你向前。门消失了，你站在一个不可能的场景中。一艘船的甲板在你周围打开，但四面八方变幻莫测的海面是伤痕累累的肉色，在充满陌生星座的晴空下翻滚。突然间，船的主舱门在一束病态的空灵之光的脉冲中炸开了。伴随着可怕的啧啧声，蠕动的触手从打开的门缝中溢出来，向你扑来。",
	"This self-contained dimension is fueled by the power of the Far Realm. Planar instability prevents characters from moving beyond the immediate area of the deck (including jumping off the ship or fleeing belowdecks).": "这个自足的维度是由远界的力量所推动的。平面的不稳定性使人物无法超越甲板的直接区域（包括跳下船或逃离甲板下）。",
	"As the portal opens, you feel a lurch as its magic wraps around you. The door is gone suddenly, and you are standing in a hot and humid warehouse filled with crates stacked to the ceiling. Windows high up on the walls let in light and reveal what look like tropical trees outside. The crates are organized in mazelike rows, making it hard to see how far the warehouse spreads. From somewhere to your right, you hear humming, running footsteps, and the squeak of a wheeled cart drawing closer.": "当传送门打开时，你感到一阵阵颤抖，因为它的魔力包裹着你。门突然消失了，你站在一个湿热的仓库里，里面堆满了堆到天花板的箱子。墙壁上高高的窗户透出光线，露出外面看起来像热带树木的东西。这些板条箱被组织成迷宫般的一排，使人很难看清仓库的范围。从你右边的某个地方，你听到嗡嗡声、跑步的脚步声和一辆轮子车的吱吱声在靠近。",
	"The guardian of this warehouse is {@creature Dagdra Deepforge|OoW} (NG female dwarf), a long-time employee of Dran Enterprises. She has the iconic documancer feature (see \"{@book Iconic Faction Features|AI|4|Iconic Faction Features}\" in {@book appendix B|AI|4}) and uses the {@creature priest} stat block with these changes:": "这个仓库的守护者是{@creature Dagdra Deepforge|OoW}（NG女矮人），是德兰企业的长期雇员。她有标志性的文档管理员功能（见{@book appendix B|AI|4}中的\"{@book Iconic Faction Features|AI|4|Iconic Faction Features}\"），并使用{@creature priest}状态块，有这些变化。",

She pushes a cart loaded with Chultan-themed tourist keepsakes and collectibles. All bear the logo of Acquisitions Incorporated, but these are actually knock-offs created as part of Dran Enterprise's ongoing efforts to undercut Acquisitions Incorporated's reputation and success.": "{@creature Dagdra Deepforge|OoW|Dagdra}戴着一件徽章，它已经破旧不堪，上面的图像的下半部分已经消失。成功通过DC12智力（{@skill Religion}）或智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查可以确定，莫拉丁的神圣标志曾经在徽章上，但只剩下一点火焰。她推着一辆手推车，上面装着以苏丹为主题的旅游纪念品和收藏品。所有的东西都印有收购公司的标志，但这些其实都是山寨货，是德兰企业为削弱收购公司的声誉和成功而不断努力的一部分。",
	"Dagdra has made a lot of bad choices in her life, from leaving her church to joining Dran Enterprises and getting stuck with warehouse duty. Her job mostly involves running from one row of crates to another, filling orders for customers and grouping them for retrieval by other Dran Enterprises employees.

	"If Dagdra notices intruders, she is startled and begins to call for help. The characters must either silence her, overcome her quickly, or convince her to hear their story. Fortunately, Dagdra is open to reconsidering her life choices and allegiances—and is having a really bad day. If the characters agree to help her complete her tasks, she reveals the location of the exit portal.": "如果达格德拉注意到入侵者，她会被吓一跳，开始呼救。角色们必须让她闭嘴，迅速战胜她，或者说服她听他们的故事。幸运的是，达格德拉愿意重新考虑她的生活选择和忠诚，而且她今天的心情非常糟糕。如果角色们同意帮助她完成任务，她就会透露出口门户的位置。",
	"Helping {@creature Dagdra Deepforge|OoW|Dagdra} complete her tasks involves a specific process and a number of ability checks, all at DC 12. When an order comes in, it appears magically on Dagdra's ledger, three items at a time (see the Dagdra's List table below). The dwarf calls out the three items, and a character must make an ability check using one of the skills noted for an item to locate that item in the warehouse. Each check represents the act of either physically searching for the item or understanding the characteristics of the item. The narrow space between piles of crates means that only one character can search for each item.": "帮助{@creature Dagdra Deepforge|OoW|Dagdra}完成她的任务涉及一个特定的过程和一些能力检查，都是DC12。当一个订单进来时，它会神奇地出现在Dagdra的账本上，一次三件（见下面的Dagdra的清单表）。矮人叫出了这三件物品，一个角色必须使用为某件物品注明的技能之一进行能力检查，以在仓库中找到该物品。每一次检定都代表了物理搜索物品或了解物品特性的行为。成堆的板条箱之间的狭窄空间意味着每个物品只能由一个角色来搜索。",
	"The items are found and collected regardless of the success or failure of the checks. But if the characters fail three or more of the four checks necessary to collect a group of items, their lackluster performance causes a {@creature bearded devil} productivity specialist to appear and attack the party (including Dagdra) for 1 round. The devil then vanishes, and the party gains a failure point.": "无论检查的成功与否，这些物品都会被找到并收集。但如果人物在收集一组物品所需的四次检查中失败了三次或更多，他们的乏力表现会导致一个{@creature bearded devil}生产力专家出现，并攻击派对（包括达格德拉）1轮。然后，这个魔鬼消失了，聚会获得一个失败点。",

	"For example, the expansion option available to the headquarters might amount to simply digging out more space beneath Tresendar Manor.

	"Advancing a franchise is meant to be a major accomplishment for the players and their characters. This is a moment to celebrate and reward the party's deeds and to help the players get excited about designing and selecting their franchise upgrades.

There is no wrong way to approach the process.": "推进特许经营权是为了让玩家和他们的角色取得重大成就。这是一个庆祝和奖励党的事迹的时刻，并帮助玩家对设计和选择他们的专营权升级感到兴奋。有些玩家可能会专注于机械，而另一些人则喜欢梦想特许经营总部的外观和感觉的创造力。在这个过程中，没有错误的方法。",
	"Headquarters customization is deliberately open-ended to allow for creativity. This might create some work for you as the DM, since you adjudicate the characters' customization choices.

The urgency of seeking out the final orrery component at Horn Enclave depends on whether the party successfully claimed the two components held by Dran Enterprises, or whether they watched the mind flayer Szorrulax vanish with the components in hand. Moreover, knowing that the Six are behind the attacks on Acquisitions Incorporated, the characters can learn everything Head Office knows about that faction—but what is known about the Six amounts to little more than rumors and their somewhat-trademark-infringing logo.

You also decide how much time and what specific effort is necessary for the characters and Flabbergast to determine and track down those components. This might involve short side quests of your own devising, or having NPCs conveniently turn out to be a source of some components.

	"If the characters need the ritual performed in an emergency, they can activate the token by speaking the command word \"Whippoorwill.\" Flabbergast then uses a crystal ball to locate them and perform the ritual. By possessing the bodies of dwarf guards and Clan Horn operatives, the characters should be able to successfully defend their own magically slumbering bodies and get them out of the enclave safely. And possessing the token also puts the characters in a position where the ritual might be cast accidentally if they don't use it to enter the enclave, strictly for your amusement.": "如果人物在紧急情况下需要进行仪式，他们可以通过说出 \"Whippoorwill \"这个命令词来激活令牌。然后Flabbergast会用水晶球来定位他们并进行仪式。通过拥有矮人守卫和角族特工的身体，角色们应该能够成功地保护自己的魔法沉睡的身体，并将他们安全地带出飞地。而拥有令牌也让人物处于一个位置，如果他们不使用令牌进入飞地，仪式可能会被意外地施放，这完全是为了让你感到高兴。",

To make sure nothing goes wrong with the ceremony that might upset Gwendolyn's mother, he plans on checking the vault while Gwendolyn and Tannus are saying their vows, and must report any disturbances or thefts.": "索曼的秘密涉及他对阿玛拉的职业奉献。为了确保仪式不出任何问题，让格温多林的母亲不高兴，他计划在格温多林和坦努斯说誓言的时候检查金库，并且必须报告任何干扰或偷窃行为。",
	"Gorat (CN male dwarf {@creature berserker}) is Tannus's cousin and oldest friend, and bears many scars from the battles they've fought together. He loves battle still, and is struggling to understand and support Tannus's change of heart and mind. Gorat carries no weapons for the wedding, but he's resourceful enough to turn anything he grabs into a weapon. Such improvised weapons use the normal berserker attack statistics.": "戈拉特（CN男矮人{@creature berserker}）是坦纳斯的表弟和最老的朋友，在他们一起打过的战斗中留下了许多伤痕。他仍然热爱战斗，并且正在努力理解和支持坦纳斯的心态和思想变化。戈拉特在婚礼上没有携带武器，但他足智多谋，可以把他抓到的任何东西变成武器。这种即兴的武器使用正常的狂暴者攻击统计。",
	"Gorat's secret involves his goal to deliver a toast during the dining hall celebration that will call Tannus to battle, to see once and for all whether his friend has changed. Gorat does not do this out of malice, but out of love. He wants to ensure that his friend is on the proper path.": "高拉特的秘密涉及到他的目标，即在食堂的庆祝活动中发表祝酒词，召唤坦努斯参加战斗，以便一劳永逸地看到他的朋友是否已经改变。高拉特这样做不是出于恶意，而是出于爱。他想确保他的朋友走在正确的道路上。",
	"Jormun's secret involves relief that his son has changed his ways. Though he has not confessed this to anyone, he hopes that Tannus can leave his days of battle behind and find love and peace with Gwendolyn. If a battle breaks out, Jormun stands by Tannus or Gwendolyn (whoever is in greater danger).": "乔尔蒙的秘密包括对他的儿子改邪归正的欣慰。虽然他没有向任何人坦白这一点，但他希望坦努斯能够摆脱战斗的日子，与格温多林一起找到爱与和平。如果发生战斗，乔蒙会站在坦努斯或格温多林身边（无论谁的处境更危险）。",
	"Nine other dwarves representing both families have come to see the wedding—and to underline the fact that the two families really don't trust one another. The Dharguns see the Thunderwinds as uncouth and violent, while the Thunderwinds see the Dharguns as uppity and boring. None of the guests carry weapons, for the safety of all attending.": "另外九个代表两个家族的矮人也来参加婚礼，并强调了两个家族真的不信任对方的事实。在达贡家族看来，雷风家族是粗鲁和暴力的，而雷风家族则认为达贡家族是傲慢和无聊的。为了所有与会者的安全，没有一个客人携带武器。",
	"Horn Enclave is a legendary dwarven stronghold run by Clan Horn, wealthy shield dwarves whose estates and holds spread across the Spine of the World mountains. The enclave's business is the leasing of secure vaults to wealthy patrons, with nigh-impregnable defenses designed to keep each vault's contents safe from thieves. Map 5.1 shows the layout of Horn Enclave.": "霍恩飞地是一个传说中的矮人据点，由富裕的盾牌矮人霍恩家族经营，他们的庄园和财产遍布世界之脊山脉。飞地的业务是向富有的主顾出租安全的金库，金库的防御措施几乎是坚不可摧的，以保证每个金库的内容不被盗贼窃取。地图5.1显示了霍恩飞地的布局。",
	"Horn Enclave is a fully inhabited living space, workshop, and stronghold.": "喇叭飞地是一个完全有人居住的生活空间、车间和据点。",
	"The enclave is home to more than one hundred dwarves, with nearly half of those working as guards. Clan Horn is led by Lady Kira Horn and Lord Zardak Horn. Zardak is getting on in years, nearly blind, and increasingly defers to Lady Kira's decisions. Rizwin Horn, their daughter, is a capable diplomat and negotiator who greets all guests to the enclave. The head mage for the enclave is a dwarf known as Ironbeard, responsible for security and charged with inspecting all deposits to the vaults. (The stat blocks to be used for these NPCs are found when they first appear in the adventure.)": "该飞地有一百多个矮人，其中近一半的人从事守卫工作。霍恩家族由基拉-霍恩夫人和扎尔达克-霍恩大人领导。扎尔达克年事已高，几乎失明，越来越听从基拉夫人的决定。他们的女儿里兹温-霍恩（Rizwin Horn）是一位能干的外交家和谈判家，她迎接所有来到飞地的客人。飞地的首席法师是一个被称为 \"铁胡子 \"的矮人，他负责安全，并负责检查所有存入金库的资金。(用于这些NPC的状态块可以在他们第一次出现在冒险中时找到）。",
	"The Horn Enclave map shows the layout of the fortress and its described locations. Guest quarters are located in the northwest, near the tavern. The vaults are located to the northeast. The chambers of the enclave's lady and lord are located to the east, beyond the great halls. To the south stand residences, forges, and the enclave's temple.": "喇叭飞地地图显示了要塞的布局和其描述的位置。客人的宿舍位于西北部，靠近酒馆。金库位于东北部。飞地夫人和领主的房间位于东部，在大殿之外。南边是住宅、锻造厂和飞地的神庙。",
	"If an alarm is raised, the dwarves cordon off sections of the enclave by accessing levers in hidden chambers, each of which drops a portcullis along a major hallway. The lever chamber north of the Hall of War controls the main gates and the two portcullises north of the Hall of War. The lever chamber east of the forge controls the portcullis south of the Hall of War. The lever chamber west of the war room controls two portcullises east of the dwarven residences. Other defenses are noted in relevant sections of the episode.": "如果警报响起，矮人就会通过进入暗室的杠杆来封锁飞地的各个部分，每个暗室都会沿着一条主要的走廊放下一个舷窗。战争大厅北面的杠杆室控制着主门和战争大厅北面的两个门闩。锻造室东面的杠杆室控制着战争大厅南面的门闩。战争厅西边的杠杆室控制着矮人住宅东边的两个舷窗。其他防御措施在本集的相关章节中都有说明。",

	"The Wedding Itinerary table provides an overview of the day's events, which are part of your recipe for hilarity and disaster. At the appointed times, guests move from one location to another and begin a specific event. If an NPC has a secret, it activates during the appropriate event. Take the player of an NPC aside and inform them of their secret goal, and explain that the importance of the goal to the body they inhabit means that they are compelled to try to accomplish this goal. Players can share their secret goal with other individual players once they learn it, as long as sharing it would not contradict that goal. For example, the player running Gwendolyn should not share their goal with the player running Tannus, because the whole point is for Gwendolyn to surprise her new husband with the gift. Likewise, the player running Rala does not share her goal with anyone having an interest in what's in the vaults.": "婚礼日程表提供了当天活动的概况，这也是你制造欢笑和灾难的秘诀之一。在指定的时间，客人们从一个地方到另一个地方，开始一个特定的事件。如果一个NPC有一个秘密，它就会在相应的事件中启动。把一个NPC的玩家带到一边，告诉他们他们的秘密目标，并解释这个目标对他们所居住的身体的重要性意味着他们不得不努力完成这个目标。玩家在得知自己的秘密目标后，可以与其他个人玩家分享，只要分享不会与该目标相矛盾。例如，经营格温多林的玩家不应该与经营坦纳斯的玩家分享他们的目标，因为整个重点是让格温多林用礼物给她的新丈夫一个惊喜。同样地，经营拉拉的玩家也不会与任何对金库中的东西感兴趣的人分享她的目标。",
	"In any free time between events, or by sneaking away from events, the characters can try to realize their primary goal of finding the final orrery component. The time of each event in the itinerary is known to all members of the caravan, so the characters can plan when to perform their heist. Of course, the secret goals of the wedding guests might impact those plans.": "在事件之间的任何空闲时间里，或者通过溜走事件，人物可以尝试实现他们的主要目标，即找到最后的矿石组件。大篷车的所有成员都知道行程中每个事件的时间，因此角色可以计划何时进行抢劫。当然，婚礼客人的秘密目标可能会影响这些计划。",
	"Unlike a typical dungeon infiltration, the layout of the enclave is not as important as the itinerary. Players are not expected to turn this into a dungeon crawl, if only because Horn Enclave is teeming with guards and other dwarves. Any wedding guests seen in private chambers or away from the events of the wedding itinerary are given a warning the first time, then questioned more carefully and searched each time thereafter. Evidence of theft or other lawbreaking could result in a guest being supervised by a guard until the caravan departs.": "与典型的地下城渗透不同，飞地的布局并不像行程那样重要。我们不希望玩家把这变成一个地牢的爬行，如果只是因为霍恩飞地有大量的卫兵和其他矮人的话。任何在私人房间或远离婚礼行程的活动中看到的婚礼客人，第一次会被警告，之后每次都会被更仔细地询问和搜查。盗窃或其他违法行为的证据可能会导致客人被警卫监督，直到商队离开。",
	"If the dwarves of Horn Enclave somehow find out that the characters are members of Acquisitions Incorporated, permanent incarceration or execution are among the best possible outcomes. Ideally, the players coming up with hilarious ways to escape will allow them to prevent such fates. Even if the characters have not used Flabbergast's ritual, it should be clear to them that paying attention to the wedding's schedule makes it easier to find times when they can more easily reach the vaults.": "如果霍恩飞地的矮人发现角色是收购公司的成员，永久监禁或处决是最好的结果。理想的情况是，玩家想出搞笑的方法来逃脱，就能避免这种命运。即使角色们没有使用弗拉博格斯特的仪式，他们也应该清楚，注意婚礼的日程安排可以更容易地找到他们可以更容易到达金库的时间。",
	"The caravan arrives at Horn Enclave.": "大篷车抵达霍恩飞地。",
	"Flabbergast performs the ritual, or the characters can otherwise infiltrate the stronghold.": "Flabbergast进行仪式，或者人物可以以其他方式潜入据点。",

	"Celebration in the dining hall.": "庆祝活动在食堂举行。",
	"Gorat gives his toast. Thoman returns from checking on the vault, informing Amara of its status just as the toast ends. Gwendolyn asks Thoman to go to the vault and bring the suit of armor to the celebration.": "高拉特致祝酒辞。索曼检查完金库后回来，在祝酒词结束时将金库的状况告诉了阿玛拉。格温多林要求索曼去金库，把那套盔甲带到庆祝会上。",
	"The caravan departs from Horn Enclave.": "大篷车从霍恩飞地出发。",
	"Guests prepare to depart. Ironbeard takes Gorat's key and deposits any last gifts in the vault. Flabbergast's ritual ends after the caravan departs.": "客人们准备离开。铁胡子拿着高拉特的钥匙，将最后的礼物存入金库。弗拉贝加斯特的仪式在商队离开后结束。",
	"The Dhargun Ironworks caravan rolls up the mountain and approaches the gates to Horn Enclave. Excitement runs high among the dwarf wedding guests, both for the coming events and for their first trip to the storied enclave. Read or paraphrase the following:": "达贡钢铁厂的大篷车滚上山，接近霍恩飞地的大门。矮人婚礼的客人们兴奋不已，既是为了即将到来的活动，也是为了他们第一次到这个传奇的飞地旅行。阅读或解读以下内容。",
	"On a gray morning with cloudy skies, three horse-drawn carriages roll up the mountain, heavy with cargo. Dwarves can be seen steering the carriages and peering out of windows, and their voices carry a sense of excitement and wonder as they approach Horn Enclave.": "在一个天空多云的灰色早晨，三辆马车载着沉重的货物滚上山。可以看到矮人驾驶着马车，从窗户向外看，当他们接近霍恩飞地时，他们的声音带着一种兴奋和好奇。",
	"The stronghold is indeed awe-inspiring. A massive arched stone entrance—a marvelous work of art in and of itself—leads into the mountain. Four sets of heavy iron portcullises stand fast before the caravan's approach, with a set of stone doors taller than a giant set behind them to mark the interior entrance to the enclave. The caravan stops and waits as a dwarf with bagpipes steps forward before the portcullis gates.": "这个堡垒确实令人敬畏。一个巨大的拱形石头入口--本身就是一件了不起的艺术品--通向山中。四套沉重的铁制舷梯在大篷车接近前严阵以待，后面还有一套比巨人还高的石门，标志着飞地的内部入口。当一个吹着风笛的矮人走到舷窗门前时，商队停下来等待。",
	"While the ritual is in play, characters have full control of their host bodies and enjoy all capabilities of their new forms, including weapon and skill proficiencies, vision, languages, and spellcasting. They can also apply proficiency bonuses or expertise for skills their characters have, albeit using the ability scores of their new form. However, any spellcasting characters discover that they have left their original magic in their original brains.": "在仪式进行时，角色可以完全控制他们的宿主身体，并享受他们新形态的所有能力，包括武器和技能的熟练度、视野、语言和法术。他们还可以应用他们的角色所拥有的技能的熟练度奖励或专长，尽管使用的是他们新形态的能力分数。然而，任何施法的角色都会发现他们把原来的魔法留在了原来的脑子里。",
	"Let each player refer to the entry in the {@book Monster Manual|MM} for their NPC's stat block, so that they can familiarize themselves with their new capabilities. The ritual's magic lasts until nightfall, which is after the caravan's departure. It can be ended before that time for any character with a {@spell dispel magic} spell (DC 20).": "让每个玩家参考{@book Monster Manual|MM}中的条目，了解他们的NPC的状态块，这样他们就可以熟悉他们的新能力。仪式的魔力持续到夜幕降临，也就是商队离开后。在那之前，任何角色都可以用{@spell dispel magic}的法术(DC20)来结束它。",
	"The carriages remain outside the Hall of War, and dwarves of Clan Horn approach to help with the cargo and lead the guests to the vault. If the characters have a different plan, they can execute it now. The party can contact Flabbergast to have him perform the ritual at any time.": "马车留在战争大厅外，霍恩氏族的矮人走过来帮助搬运货物，并带领客人前往金库。如果人物有不同的计划，他们现在就可以执行。宴会可以在任何时候联系弗拉贝加斯特，让他执行仪式。",
	"No secrets specifically activate at this time. However, several NPCs have secrets triggered by events rather than a specific time. For example, you would provide Tannus's player with the groom's secret if at any time Tannus is about to swing a weapon to damage a creature. (You can decide whether to allow Tannus to fight to protect himself or others, but should encourage the player running him to think about creative nonattack ways to influence the fight.) Provide Amara her secret if she sees her daughter Gwendolyn in danger. Provide Jormun his secret if he sees Gwendolyn or Tannus in danger.": "没有秘密在这个时候具体激活。然而，有几个NPC的秘密是由事件而非特定时间触发的。例如，如果在任何时候Tannus要挥舞武器伤害一个生物，你就会向Tannus的玩家提供这个新郎的秘密。(你可以决定是否允许坦纳斯为保护自己或他人而战斗，但应该鼓励经营他的玩家思考创造性的非攻击方式来影响战斗）。如果阿玛拉看到她的女儿格温多林处于危险之中，就为她提供秘密。如果乔蒙看到格温多林或坦努斯处于危险之中，就为他提供秘密。",
	"Though most players should embrace the mayhem and roleplaying opportunity created by their NPCs' goals, some might have trouble reconciling these goals with their desire to accomplish their franchise mission. Downplaying a secret goal can feel like the best path to securing the orrery component and winning, while some players might blurt out their secret goal with the excuse that their character would try to do so.": "尽管大多数玩家应该接受NPC的目标所带来的混乱和角色扮演的机会，但有些人可能会在协调这些目标和完成他们的特许经营任务的愿望之间遇到困难。淡化一个秘密的目标可能会让人觉得这是确保矿石组件和获胜的最佳途径，而有些玩家可能会以他们的角色会尝试这样做为借口而说出他们的秘密目标。",
	"Encourage players to embrace the roles and enjoy the concept of momentarily placing their NPC's secret goal as a top priority. Players might be more willing to take this on if you let them know that the scenario takes their conflicting priorities into account. Indeed, these scenes place an emphasis on situational comedy over numerical challenge. So players should think of the role as their challenge—can they succeed at playing someone they're not?": "鼓励玩家接受这些角色，并享受将他们的NPC的秘密目标暂时作为首要任务的概念。如果你让他们知道这个场景考虑到了他们相互冲突的优先权，那么玩家可能会更愿意承担这个任务。事实上，这些场景强调的是情景喜剧而不是数字挑战。因此，玩家应该把这个角色看作是他们的挑战--他们能否成功地扮演自己不是的人？",
	"The caravan is met in the Hall of War by Rizwin Horn, daughter of Lady Kira and Lord Zardak. Rizwin is a capable diplomat and negotiator, and she expects the wedding guests and caravan servants to stick to the areas indicated by the itinerary. She despises Acquisitions Incorporated, and brings the full force of the enclave down upon the characters if she learns they are members of a franchise.": "商队在战争大厅遇到了基拉夫人和扎尔达克勋爵的女儿里兹温-霍恩。里兹温是个能干的外交家和谈判家，她希望婚礼上的客人和商队的仆人们能坚持在行程表上注明的区域内活动。她看不起收购公司，如果她知道这些人物是特许经营权的成员，她会把飞地的全部力量施加在他们身上。",
	"Beyond the double doors is an enormous rectangular hall, easily fifty feet wide and over a hundred feet long, with smaller double doors set into the other three walls. Every surface of the walls, floor, and ceiling is exquisitely carved with runes and bas reliefs depicting dwarves at war. Grand pillars shaped like stone dwarves hold up the ceiling.": "双门之外是一个巨大的长方形大厅，宽50英尺，长100多英尺，其他三面墙上都有较小的双门。墙壁、地板和天花板的每一个表面都精致地雕刻着符文和浮雕，描绘着矮人的战争。形状像石制矮人的大柱子撑起了天花板。",
	"The floor is intricately carved and appears to be inset with stone tiles that can shift, lift, and rotate. Five dwarves are in the process of moving tiles around, as if shaping a massive mosaic. Not far from the dwarves is a large metallic construct with a terrifying number of appendages ending in blades and saws. It is thankfully unmoving.": "地板上有复杂的雕刻，似乎镶嵌着可以移动、提升和旋转的石砖。五个矮人正在移动石砖，仿佛在塑造一幅巨大的马赛克。离矮人不远的地方有一个巨大的金属结构，它的附属物数量多得吓人，末端是刀片和锯子。幸好它没有移动。",
	"A female dwarf with sharp eyes and deep red hair tied in braids calls out a greeting as she approaches the caravan. \"Welcome, guests and friends of Clan Dhargun and Clan Thunderwind! Horn Enclave is at your disposal for the wonderful occasion of your wedding!\"": "一个眼睛锐利、深红色头发扎成辫子的女性矮人在走近商队时喊出了问候语。\"欢迎，达贡氏族和雷风氏族的客人和朋友! 在你们婚礼的美好时刻，\"号角飞地 \"任由你们处置！\"",
	"If asked about the construct, Rizwin calls it the slaughterstone eviscerator, and explains that it's there to protect Horn Enclave. \"Moradin help anyone who crosses us,\" she says, laughing. The construct can be activated by Ironbeard or Rizwin, or by anyone who accesses the control panel in its belly and succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. If the check fails by 5 or more, the construct animates and attacks.": "如果被问及这个构造，里兹温称它为屠宰石驱逐者，并解释说它的存在是为了保护霍恩飞地。她笑着说：\"莫拉丁帮助任何与我们作对的人\"。铁胡子或里兹温可以激活这个构造，或者任何进入它肚子里的控制面板并使用盗贼工具成功进行DC20灵巧检查的人都可以激活它。如果检定失败了5次或更多，那么这个构造就会被激活并攻击。",
	"The slaughterstone eviscerator is a deadly wild card, which might serve as a frightening distraction or be woven into the characters' outrageous plans. It uses the stat block of a {@creature stone golem}, but its slam attack is a blade attack that deals slashing damage.": "屠宰石驱逐者是一张致命的野牌，它可能作为一个可怕的分心，或者被编织进人物的离谱计划中。它使用的是{@creature stone golem}的状态块，但它的猛击是一种刀刃攻击，造成砍伤。",

	"\"Your vault awaits, ready for the gifts each family has brought for the wedding. As instructed, we will safeguard these gifts until Gwendolyn and Tannus are ready to receive them.

	"Rizwin leads the wedding party through the double doors to the north, through the corridor leading past the barracks where dwarf guards can be seen lounging and training, and to the vaults. The double vault indicated with an \"X\" on the map is the vault for the wedding gifts, the largest and most valuable of which are deposited at this time. (Characters with a solid background in company history might recall that this is the same vault that the core members of Acquisitions Incorporated once robbed.)": "里兹温带领婚礼队伍穿过北面的双门，通过通往军营的走廊，可以看到矮人卫兵在那里休息和训练，然后来到金库。地图上标有 \"X \"的双保险库是存放结婚礼物的保险库，其中最大和最有价值的礼物就存放在这个时候。(对公司历史有深入了解的人物可能会记得，这是收购公司的核心成员曾经抢劫过的那个金库）。",
	"Each vault door is covered in iron bands, lined with lead to prevent scrying, is air- and watertight, and features layers of locks that make opening a vault without its keys nearly impossible. Two keys are required to open a vault door, with one typically held by the enclave and a second by the owner of the vault's contents. When both keys have been turned in multiple locks, the door opens. While the wedding is in progress, Gorat and Thoman each have one of the keys for the wedding vault.": "每个金库的门都用铁带覆盖，内衬铅以防止窥探，空气和水都是密封的，并且有多层锁，没有钥匙几乎无法打开金库。打开金库门需要两把钥匙，一把通常由飞地持有，另一把由金库内容物的所有者持有。当这两把钥匙在多把锁中被转动时，门就会打开。当婚礼正在进行时，戈拉特和索曼各自拥有婚礼金库的一把钥匙。",
	"The vault holding the orrery component has one of its keys held by Ironbeard. The other key is with Lottie at the end of this episode. See \"{@area Orrery Vault|24a|x}\" below for more information.": "存放ORRERY组件的金库，其中一把钥匙由铁胡子持有。另一把钥匙在本集结束时在洛蒂那里。更多信息见下文\"{@area Orrery Vault|24a|x}\"。",
	"Three consecutive successful DC 20 Dexterity checks using thieves' tools are required to open an outer vault door. Failing any check requires restarting the process. After three overall failures, the door to the vault gives off a loud ringing noise and four guards come to investigate. The DC is reduced to 10 if the character has one of the vault's keys. Any character who has read the vault records (found in Ironbeard's quarters or Lady Kira and Lord Zardak's quarters) has advantage on checks to open a vault door.": "需要连续三次使用盗贼工具进行成功的DC20灵巧检查才能打开外库门。任何检查失败都需要重新开始这个过程。总共三次失败后，金库的门会发出响亮的铃声，四个守卫会来调查。如果角色有金库的钥匙，那么DC就会降低到10。任何读过金库记录（在铁胡子的房间或基拉夫人和扎尔达克勋爵的房间找到）的角色在打开金库门的检查中都有优势。",
	"Some vaults are set up as two rooms, with the magically locked door of the second room also requiring a password to be spoken before the door can be opened. The wedding vault is a double vault, with the password set as seen at \"Ironbeard's Entrance\" below.": "有些金库被设置成两个房间，第二个房间被魔法锁住的门也需要说出密码才能打开。婚礼金库是一个双层金库，其密码设置如下文 \"铁胡子的入口 \"所示。",
	"The single vault holding the orrery component is immediately northeast of the vault marked \"X.\" This vault is further detailed in the \"{@area Orrery Vault|24a|x}\" section below. Discovering which vault holds the component is an important bit of business that the characters must accomplish at some point during the day. Rizwin knows the location, as does Ironbeard, Lady Kira, and Lord Zardak. The contents of all vaults are also noted in the vault records, a copy of which is kept in Ironbeard's quarters, with another copy in Lady Kira and Lord Zardak's quarters. A character who has studied the records has advantage on checks to open any vault door.": "装有魔法阵组件的单一金库紧邻标有 \"X \"的金库的东北方向。这个金库在下面的\"{@area Orrery Vault|24a|x} \"部分有进一步的说明。发现哪个金库有这个部件是一件重要的事情，人物必须在一天中的某个时候完成。里兹温知道这个位置，铁胡子、基拉夫人和扎尔达克勋爵也知道。所有金库的内容也都记录在金库记录中，其中一份保存在铁胡子的宿舍里，另一份保存在基拉夫人和扎尔达克大人的宿舍里。研究过这些记录的人物在打开任何金库门的检查中具有优势。",
	"When he's convinced that all is well, Ironbeard asks the couple to set the password they wish to use for the inner door. For the duration of the wedding, the inner door will remain open so that Gorat and Thoman can access the vaults. But Ironbeard explains that afterward, even someone with both keys cannot open the inner vault unless Gwendolyn or Tannus speaks the password.": "当他确信一切正常时，铁胡子要求这对夫妇设置他们希望用于内门的密码。在婚礼期间，内门将保持开放，以便戈拉特和索曼可以进入金库。但铁胡子解释说，之后，即使有两把钥匙的人也无法打开内库，除非格温多林或坦努斯说出密码。",
	"If the characters are running Gwendolyn and Tannus, they can set the password as they wish. If the characters are not possessing the wedding guests but are present in the vault, things can get potentially interesting.": "如果这些人物在管理格温多林和坦努斯，他们可以按自己的意愿设置密码。如果这些人物没有附身于婚礼宾客，但却出现在金库中，事情就有可能变得很有趣。",
	"If the players are not running the wedding party at this point—and if they're up for even more of a roleplaying and improvisational challenge—Gwendolyn and Tannus look to one another and whisper, \"Whippoorwill.\" They laughingly explain that a whippoorwill flew overhead when they first met. Ask any characters within earshot (as they will be if they're acting as tag-along wedding guests) to make Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks, with the highest check overhearing the password. That character gets a moment's warning of what's coming.": "如果玩家在这时没有主持婚礼--如果他们想接受更多的角色扮演和即兴表演的挑战--温多林和坦努斯互相看了一眼，低声说：\"Whippoorwill\"。他们笑着解释说，当他们第一次见面时，头顶上飞过一只whippoorwill。要求任何在耳边的角色（如果他们作为随行的婚礼客人，他们会在耳边）进行智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查，检查结果最高的人听到了密码。这个角色会得到片刻的警告，知道将要发生什么。",
	"In an amazing coincidence, \"Whippoorwill\" is the phrase Flabbergast set on the stone token to trigger casting the ritual. If the players have come up with a savvy approach to entering the enclave that didn't make use of the ritual, you don't need to use this option. But if your group will have fun with it, Flabbergast hears the word spoken and casts the ritual, so that the characters' bodies slip into a state of slumber as they possess the bodies of the wedding party. What approach the possessed dwarves—now run by the players—might take to explain the characters' sudden unconsciousness, then safely hide those slumbering bodies away, is up to the players and you.": "一个惊人的巧合是，\"Whippoorwill \"是Flabbergast为触发施放仪式而设置在石头令牌上的短语。如果玩家们想出了一个进入飞地的精明办法，没有利用仪式，你就不需要使用这个选项。但如果你的小组会玩得很开心的话，弗拉博格斯特听到了所说的话并施放了仪式，这样人物的身体就会在附身于婚礼当事人的身体时滑入沉睡状态。被附身的矮人--现在由玩家管理--可能会采取什么方法来解释角色的突然昏迷，然后安全地把那些沉睡的尸体藏起来，这取决于玩家和你。",
	"No secrets specifically activate at this time. However, Thoman and Gorat now each have a key to the vault that allows them to act on their secrets later.": "这时没有秘密具体激活。然而，索曼和戈拉特现在各有一把金库的钥匙，允许他们以后对自己的秘密采取行动。",

	"Great tree trunks have been cut in half to form a series of long tables in this drinking hall. The northern wall behind the bar is formed entirely of kegs of ale, all of them tapped. Busy servers pour frothy mugs and serve them to the multitude of dwarves already here. As Rizwin steps into the tavern, she claps her hands once and several dwarves quickly clear two central tables for the wedding party and guests. Tall mugs of amber beer are served, while platters loaded with skewers of roasted meat and root vegetables are brought to the table. Drinks and food are on the house!": "大树的树干被切成两半，在这个饮酒大厅里形成了一系列的长桌。吧台后面的北墙完全是由一桶桶的啤酒组成的，所有的啤酒都已被打开。忙碌的服务员倒出泡沫杯，并把它们端给已经在这里的众多矮人。当里兹温走进酒馆时，她拍了一下手，几个矮人迅速为婚礼当事人和客人清理出两张中央桌子。高脚杯的琥珀色啤酒被端了上来，而装着烤肉串和根茎类蔬菜的盘子被端到了桌上。饮料和食物都是免费的!",
	"For the next two hours, the caravan party enjoys ale and food, toasts Gwendolyn and Tannus, and swaps tall tales. Guests can visit other tables to meet Clan Horn dwarves, so the characters can move around without drawing attention to themselves. Ironbeard and Rizwin are both here, and the characters can speak to them to try to pick up clues as to the location of the orrery component. (Attempts by any characters to hit on Rizwin are made with disadvantage.)": "在接下来的两个小时里，商队一行人享受着啤酒和食物，向格温多林和坦努斯敬酒，并交换着高大的故事。客人们可以到其他桌去见霍恩家族的矮人，所以人物可以四处走动而不引起别人的注意。铁胡子和里兹温都在这里，角色们可以和他们交谈，试图找出关于兽栏组件位置的线索。(任何角色试图击中Rizwin都是不利的。)",
	"Many of the Clan Horn dwarves have been drinking heavily. Targeting the heavier drinkers can grant advantage on checks made to pry information from them. While in the tavern, the dwarves are relaxed and won't react negatively to a failed Charisma check. However, continued failures result in guards being called. Those guards issue a warning against bothering folk not in the wedding party, and might eventually search or incarcerate any individual who continues to cause trouble.": "许多霍恩家族的矮人都喝得很厉害。瞄准喝得比较多的人，可以在向他们打探消息的检查中获得优势。在酒馆里，矮人都很放松，不会对魅力检查失败作出消极反应。然而，持续的失败会导致守卫被叫来。这些守卫会发出警告，禁止打扰不在婚礼队伍中的人，并可能最终搜查或监禁任何继续制造麻烦的人。",

	"{@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW}'s wands pulse with magical light, though only two of them have actual useful properties. The first is a {@item wand of binding} that glows purple. The second wand blinks with blue and green light and is a {@item Failed Experiment Wand|AI|failed experiment} at combining a {@item wand of fireballs} and a {@item Wand of Lightning Bolts||wand of lightning}. It functions as a {@item wand of fireballs}, except it has only two charges per day and casts either a green-flamed {@spell fireball} or a blue {@spell lightning bolt} at random. {@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW} also carries a scroll tube with three {@item Spell Scroll||spell scrolls}: {@spell prayer of healing}, {@spell silence}, and {@spell stone shape}.": "{@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW}的魔杖会发出神奇的光，尽管其中只有两个有实际的有用的属性。第一根是发紫光的{@item wand of binding}。第二根魔杖闪烁着蓝色和绿色的光，是一根{@item Failed Experiment Wand|AI|failed experiment}结合{@item wand of fireballs}和{@item Wand of Lightning Bolts||wand of lightning}的魔杖。它的功能和{@item wand of fireballs}一样，只是每天只有两次充电，并随机施放绿色火焰{@spell fireball}或蓝色{@spell lightning bolt}。{@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW}还携带一个卷轴管，里面有三个{@item Spell Scroll||spell scrolls}。{@spell prayer of healing}, {@spell silence}, 和 {@spell stone shape}。",
	"Lady Kira Horn and Lord Zardak Horn (NG female and male dwarf {@creature Veteran||veterans}) arrive halfway through lunch. Zardak is half-blind and periodically confers with his wife to make sure he is speaking to the correct person. Both are pleased to have a wedding in their halls, and they engage in small talk to ask polite questions of their guests. Many of those questions involve the business operations of Dhargun Ironworks and the military history of Clan Thunderwind. Thankfully, neither Kira nor Zardak appear to mind if a character isn't too sure about the answer.": "基拉-霍恩夫人和扎尔达克-霍恩勋爵（NG雌性和雄性侏儒{@creature Veteran||veterans}）在午餐中途到达。扎尔达克是个半瞎子，他不时地和他的妻子交流，以确保他是在和正确的人说话。两人都很高兴在他们的大厅里举行婚礼，他们进行小范围的交谈，向客人提出礼貌的问题。其中许多问题涉及达贡铁厂的商业运作和雷风部族的军事历史。值得庆幸的是，如果一个角色对答案不太确定，基拉和扎尔达克似乎都不会介意。",
	"At a time of your choosing, Lord Zardak appears to notice something odd about one of the characters or the body they inhabit, but this ends up just being his bad eyesight. Fifteen minutes after they arrive, the two take their leave.": "在你选择的时间，扎尔达克勋爵似乎注意到其中一个人物或他们居住的身体有什么奇怪的地方，但这最终只是他的视力不好。在他们到达15分钟后，两人告辞。",
	"Rala's secret triggers during this scene, and the character inside Rala's body is momentarily overwhelmed by the doppelganger's personality. Stealing Gorat's key requires a Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check contested by Gorat's Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. Gorat has disadvantage on the check from the distraction of the festivities—or, if controlled by a character, he could decide to just hand over the key. Rala must then decide whether to also try to steal Thoman's key (if he isn't possessed by a character inspired to give it to her). Having two keys makes opening the door effortless, but the security chief is a cagey and suspicious sort.": "拉拉的秘密在这个场景中被触发，拉拉身体里的人物一时被二重身的人格所淹没。偷取Gorat的钥匙需要一个灵巧（{@skill Sleight of Hand}）的检查，由Gorat的智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查竞争。戈拉特在检查中处于劣势，因为庆典活动让他分心，或者，如果被一个角色控制，他可以决定直接交出钥匙。然后，拉拉必须决定是否也要尝试偷取托曼的钥匙（如果他没有被一个角色所控制来给她的话）。有两把钥匙可以毫不费力地打开门，但保安队长是个狡猾和多疑的人。",
	"Rizwin directs the guests out of the tavern and to the guest quarters. Here they can relax, take a nap (and sober up as necessary) before changing into the formal wedding attire waiting for them in their rooms.": "里兹温引导客人们走出酒馆，来到客人的宿舍。在这里，他们可以放松一下，小睡一下（必要时可以醒酒），然后换上在房间里等着他们的正式婚礼服装。",
	"Once the characters reach the vaults, they must decide how to proceed.

	"No secrets specifically activate at this time.": "目前没有专门激活的秘密。",
	"Dressed in their finest, the members of the Dhargun and Thunderwind families head to the temple. Rizwin leads them south through the Hall of War and east past dwarven residences. Ironbeard exits his quarters to join them, revealing the location of that area if the characters haven't sussed it out already. The temple is beautifully carved to depict the Mordinsamman (the dwarven pantheon), including fine statues of Moradin, Clangeddin Silverbeard, Berronar Truesilver, and Haela Brightaxe.": "穿着最好的衣服，达贡和雷风家族的成员前往神庙。里兹温带领他们向南穿过战争大厅，向东经过矮人的住所。铁胡子走出他的住处与他们会合，如果角色们还没有弄清楚的话，就可以知道那个区域的位置。这座神庙雕刻得非常漂亮，描绘了莫丁萨曼（矮人万神殿），包括莫拉丁（Moradin）、克兰格丁-银须（Clangeddin Silverbeard）、贝罗纳-特鲁西尔弗（Berronar Truesilver）和海拉-布莱特克斯（Haela Brightaxe）的精致雕像。",
	"After initial pleasantries, Rizwin indicates to Jormun that he may climb the steps to the dais to begin the ceremony. At this time, Thoman's secret triggers.": "在最初的寒暄之后，里兹温向乔蒙示意，他可以爬上台阶，开始仪式。这时，索曼的秘密触发了。",
	"As the ceremony begins, Thoman gets an odd feeling as he recalls hearing Amara worrying about the vault and what might happen to the still-fractious relationship between the families if anything were stolen from it. To appease Amara, he wants to check the vault and report to her if all is not well. This requires borrowing Gorat's key, which Gorat lends willingly (whether run by a player or not). The mercurial Thunderwind has no concerns that a Dhargun lackey would dare do anything to jeopardize the wedding. However, if Gorat's key is still missing after being stolen by Rala, the doppelganger will need to quickly arrange to have it found to avoid a sudden catastrophe.": "仪式开始后，索曼有一种奇怪的感觉，因为他想起了阿玛拉对金库的担心，以及如果金库里的东西被盗，可能会对两家人之间仍然不和的关系产生什么影响。为了安抚阿玛拉，他想检查金库，如果一切都不顺利，就向她报告。这需要借用戈拉特的钥匙，而戈拉特是心甘情愿地借给他的（无论是否由玩家操作）。多情的雷风并不担心一个达贡的走狗会敢于做出危害婚礼的事情。然而，如果戈拉特的钥匙在被拉拉偷走后仍然下落不明，二重奏就需要迅速安排人找到它，以避免突然发生灾难。",
	"Jormun would normally provide a fiery ceremony on the virtues of the Mordinsamman, with an emphasis on Clangeddin's battle prowess. If a character is controlling him, that character can be put on the spot to describe the ceremony and how the dwarves reconcile the different elements of the pantheon (in particular, the balance between gods of war such as Clangeddin and those of marriage and home, such as Berronar Truesilver). Clan Dhargun is pleased by an emphasis on the hearth, while Clan Thunderwind appreciates an emphasis on battle.": "乔蒙通常会提供一个火热的仪式，介绍莫丁萨曼的美德，并强调克兰格丁的战斗力。如果有一个角色在控制他，那么这个角色可以当场描述这个仪式，以及矮人如何调和万神殿的不同元素（尤其是在战争之神如Clangeddin与婚姻和家庭之神如Berronar Truesilver之间的平衡）。达贡氏族对强调炉灶感到高兴，而雷风氏族则欣赏对战斗的强调。",
	"The hall then grows quiet. Look to the characters inhabiting the wedding couple, letting them know everyone is staring at them. If they don't guess what's happening, one of the guests leans forward and reminds the couple to join Jormun on the altar. The guests have a good laugh at the couple forgetting the ceremony details, chalking it all up to the pair being nervous.": "大厅随即变得安静起来。看向居住在婚礼夫妇中的人物，让他们知道大家都在盯着他们。如果他们没有猜到发生了什么，其中一个客人就会向前倾，提醒这对夫妇在祭坛上加入乔蒙。宾客们对这对夫妇忘记了仪式的细节感到很好笑，认为这一切都是因为这对夫妇紧张。",
	"Once at the altar, Jormun asks for the couple's vows. This is a fun opportunity to see if the two players want to improvise vows, since they were supposed to have memorized them. After the vows, Jormun pronounces them a married couple and the hall erupts in cheers.": "一旦到了祭坛，乔尔蒙就要求这对夫妇的誓言。这是一个有趣的机会，看看这两个玩家是否想即兴创作誓言，因为他们应该已经记住了。宣誓后，乔尔蒙宣布他们成为夫妻，大厅里爆发出欢呼声。",
	"After allowing everyone to receive the couple, Rizwin thanks Jormun for the wonderful ceremony (even if it left much to be desired) and leads everyone back the way they came and north to the dining hall. Characters could try to make their way to the vault at this time, though anyone doing so runs into Thoman, and are likely to be noticed arriving late to the celebration.": "在让大家迎接这对新人之后，里兹温感谢乔蒙的精彩仪式（尽管它还有很多不足之处），并带领大家原路返回，向北走到饭厅。角色们可以尝试在这个时候前往金库，不过这样做的人都会遇到索曼，而且很可能会被发现在庆祝会上迟到。",
	"The dining hall has been festooned with colored streamers and lit with huge braziers. Long tables in the center include platters of food and seats for guests, while a table nearby holds gifts from attendees (including a few from Clan Horn). Servers bring ale and spirits, and the mood is festive. Ironbeard, Rizwin, and even {@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW} are all here, though Lady Kira and Lord Zardak are not.": "饭厅里已经挂上了彩色的旗帜，用巨大的火盆点燃。中间的长桌包括食物的盘子和客人的座位，而旁边的桌子上放着与会者的礼物（包括一些来自霍恩家族的礼物）。侍者们带来了麦酒和烈酒，气氛喜气洋洋。铁胡子、里兹温，甚至{@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW}都在这里，不过基拉夫人和扎尔达克大人不在。",
	"Gorat's secret is the first to activate in this section. His goal is to come up with a toast that calls Tannus to battle, to see once and for all whether his friend has changed. Encourage the player whose character possesses Gorat to make up a toast that urges Tannus to tell a story of his prowess at war. Secretly, Gorat hopes that Tannus turns down the challenge. How Tannus responds could determine whether his clan has an easier or harder time calming down once chaos erupts. A good battle tale leaves them eager to fight!": "高拉特的秘密是本节中第一个启动的。他的目标是想出一个祝酒词，召唤坦纳斯参加战斗，以一劳永逸地了解他的朋友是否已经改变。鼓励拥有Gorat的角色的玩家编造一个祝酒词，敦促Tannus讲述他在战争中的能力的故事。暗地里，Gorat希望Tannus拒绝这个挑战。坦纳斯的反应可能决定他的部族在混乱爆发后是更容易还是更难平静下来。一个好的战斗故事会让他们渴望战斗!",
	"As the challenge is being resolved, Thoman returns from checking the vault and heads to Amara to report his findings.": "当挑战被解决时，索曼检查完金库回来，前往阿马拉报告他的发现。",
	"When Thoman arrives, Gwendolyn asks him to borrow Gorat's key (if he doesn't still have it), then go to the vault and bring the suit of armor to the celebration. Depending on what Thoman has found, it's possible that he's in the middle of telling Amara about missing items.": "当索曼到达时，格温多林要求他借用戈拉特的钥匙（如果他没有还在的话），然后去金库，把那套盔甲带到庆典上。根据索曼的发现，他有可能正在向阿玛拉讲述失踪物品的情况。",
	"If an item has been stolen, Amara's secret triggers and she races to get her battleaxe from the gift table. She then begins searching for the culprit and screaming about thieves and saboteurs. The items in the vault are meant to bind the fractious families, and if any are missing (presumably taken back by one family or the other), the wedding might be considered invalid.": "如果有物品被盗，阿玛拉的秘密就会被触发，她会争先恐后地从礼品桌上拿回她的战斧。然后她开始寻找罪魁祸首，并大喊小偷和破坏者。保险库中的物品是为了将分裂的家庭联系在一起，如果有任何物品丢失（估计是被一个家庭或另一个家庭拿回去），婚礼可能会被认为是无效的。",
	"News of any trouble at the vault spreads like wildfire, and members of both families begin accusing each other. Chaos erupts! Thankfully, the guards of Horn Enclave know that any dwarven wedding comes with a certain amount of chaos, and are keen to let the two families sort their problems out before getting involved. As such, this scene is a great opportunity for the characters to explore their NPCs' personalities and backstories as things get heated. By focusing on the humor of potential conflicts, you can avoid having the guards rush in as a first response.": "金库出现麻烦的消息像野火一样蔓延开来，两个家族的成员开始相互指责。混乱爆发了! 值得庆幸的是，\"号角飞地 \"的守卫知道任何矮人的婚礼都会伴随着一定程度的混乱，他们很想在介入之前让两个家庭把他们的问题解决。因此，这个场景是一个很好的机会，可以让人物在事情变得激烈的时候探索他们的NPC的个性和背景故事。通过关注潜在冲突的幽默感，你可以避免让卫兵作为第一反应冲进去。",
	"The characters have many options here. They could use the opportunity to escape (or head to the orrery vault if they haven't already). More than likely, they'll be inside NPC bodies and need to defuse the situation so they can reach the caravan departure phase in one piece.": "人物在这里有很多选择。他们可以利用这个机会逃跑（如果还没有的话，也可以去兽栏的金库）。更有可能的是，他们会在NPC的身体里，需要化解这种情况，以便他们能够完整地到达商队出发阶段。",
	"The characters could try to save the marriage, perhaps resolving the crime by pinning it on one person (or convincing Rala to take the fall). Let the players develop a plan and add reactions from the crowd (including Clan Horn NPCs) as needed. Accusations and turmoil prompt Ironbeard and several guards to inspect the wedding vault, which could lead to the discovery of any breach into the orrery vault.": "角色们可以尝试挽救这段婚姻，也许通过将罪行归咎于一个人（或说服拉拉背黑锅）来解决。让玩家制定一个计划，并根据需要加入人群（包括角族的NPC）的反应。指责和骚动促使铁胡子和几个卫兵检查婚礼的金库，这可能会导致发现任何进入兽皮金库的漏洞。",
	"If violence breaks out between the families (or between Horn Enclave and any possible thieves), Tannus finds that he really wants to avoid being violent. This might be his last chance to prove his love to Gwendolyn! Jormun's secret causes him to protect the married couple at all costs. His actions could help bring the warring families together by example.": "如果家族之间爆发暴力事件（或霍恩飞地和任何可能的盗贼之间），坦努斯发现他真的想避免暴力事件。这可能是他向格温多林证明他的爱的最后机会了！。乔蒙的秘密导致他要不惜一切代价保护这对夫妻。他的行动可能有助于以身作则地将交战的家庭团结起来。",
	"If the characters have already accessed the orrery vault, they could decide they don't care what happens and sit on the sidelines to watch. In this case, take the events directly to them so that they're encouraged to react. An effective technique is to couple an NPC approaching them with a surge of emotions within one of the controlled NPCs. For example, Ironbeard could call for everyone to be searched, just as Amara (and the character controlling her) begins to contemplate what might befall her daughter if the families decide the wedding is invalid.": "如果人物已经进入了矿石库，他们可以决定不关心发生了什么，而坐在一旁观看。在这种情况下，把事件直接告诉他们，这样他们就会被鼓励做出反应。一个有效的技巧是将接近他们的NPC与被控制的NPC中的一个人的情绪波动联系起来。例如，当阿玛拉（以及控制她的角色）开始考虑如果家族决定婚礼无效，她的女儿会遭遇什么时，铁胡子可以要求对所有人进行搜查。",
	"Once the chaos dies down, the guests can go back to merrymaking until the evening comes. If the chaos doesn't die down, the dwarves of Clan Horn eventually order the warring Dhargun and Thunderwind families to leave the enclave and sort out their problems on their own.": "一旦混乱平息，客人们就可以继续狂欢，直到夜晚来临。如果混乱没有平息，霍恩家族的矮人最终会命令交战的达贡和雷风家族离开飞地，自行解决他们的问题。",
	"Guests are led—or driven at spear point—through the Hall of War and out the main doors to their waiting carriages. (Characters who triggered the ritual within the enclave will need to juggle getting both their dwarven hosts and their original bodies out.) Rizwin, Ironbeard, Lady Kira, and Lord Zardak all come to say appropriate goodbyes. Ironbeard takes Gorat's key, then returns to the dining hall with several guards to take any last gifts from the celebration to the vault. By the time he does so, the caravan has safely departed.": "客人们被带着或被驱赶着穿过战争大厅，走出大门外到他们等待的马车上。(在飞地内触发仪式的角色需要把他们的矮人主人和他们原来的身体都弄出来。) 里兹温、铁胡子、基拉夫人和扎尔达克大人都来做了适当的告别。铁胡子拿走了高拉特的钥匙，然后带着几个卫兵回到饭厅，把庆典上最后的礼物带到金库。当他这样做的时候，商队已经安全离开了。",
	"The characters can say any final words. If they stole any treasure, they can attempt to drop it over the side of the caravan for later retrieval. As the sun dips below the horizon, Flabbergast's ritual ends and the characters return to their normal bodies. Continue with the section \"{@area Battle in the Skies|26b|x}\" as they travel toward Lottie's domain.": "角色们可以说任何最后的话。如果他们偷了任何财宝，他们可以尝试把它扔到商队的边上，以便以后取回。当太阳落到地平线下时，Flabbergast的仪式结束了，人物也回到了他们正常的身体。继续进行\"{@area Battle in the Skies|26b|x} \"部分，他们向洛蒂的领地行进。",

The center of the far wall features another set of double doors.": "该区域的中心有一个下沉式的赌博坑，里面挤满了人，他们坐在皮革软垫椅上，围着铺有绿色天鹅绒的桌子。大厅的一侧是一个舞台，三个竖琴手在那里演奏，周围是有舒适椅子和小桌子的休息室。在那之后是酒吧，还有一扇大概通往厨房的门。在你的右边有一个标志，表示 \"化妆室\"，而在你的左边有一个标志表示 \"代币\"。最左边是一扇加固的铁门，上面有一把大锁。远处墙壁的中央有另一组双门。",
	"The clientele here all look a lot like the duergar you saw in the town of Fortune. All are gambling in a frenzy, arguing with one another over tokens and swearing that the next game will be the big one. Most of them are drinking heavily.": "这里的顾客都很像你在财富镇看到的杜尔加。所有人都在疯狂地赌博，彼此为代币争论不休，并发誓下一局将是大的一局。他们中的大多数人都喝得很厉害。",
	"As you take it all in, a skeleton wearing a red uniform with a high collar and a crisp-looking hat approaches you.": "当你把这一切看在眼里时，一个穿着高领红色制服、戴着看起来很清爽的帽子的骷髅向你走来。",

	"It speaks Common, though its responses are programmed.": "它能说普通话，尽管它的反应是经过编程的。",
	"A successful DC 11 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check notes a small clockwork device attached to the inside of a skeleton's skull that lights up when it speaks.": "成功通过DC11智慧({@skill Perception})检查可以注意到一个小的钟表装置连接在骷髅头骨的内部，当它说话的时候会亮起来。",
	"None of the skeletons are in a position to set up meetings with Lottie. The characters need to figure out how to get to her on their own.": "没有一个骷髅头有资格安排与洛蒂会面。这些人物需要自己想办法去找她。",
	"All manner of games can be played at Lottie's Palace, including Three-Dragon Ante, dice, Dragonchess, roulette, blackjack, and a cutthroat roleplaying game called Papers & Paychecks. A character can play any game for a cost of 3 tokens (available from the cashier). You can use any combination of checks and roleplaying you like to represent a character's attempts to gamble, but each game should involve at least three checks of DC 12 or higher. An Intelligence ({@skill History}) or Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check might allow a character to suss out the rules of a game or analyze the opposition, while an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) or Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check can represent careful play or cagey bluffing. The DC of any checks made to gamble increases by 1 for each drink a character consumes.": "在洛蒂宫可以玩各种游戏，包括三龙下注、骰子、龙棋、轮盘、21点，以及一种叫做 \"文件与支票 \"的残酷的角色扮演游戏。一个角色可以玩任何游戏，费用为3个代币（可从收银员处获得）。你可以使用你喜欢的检查和角色扮演的任何组合来表示一个角色的赌博尝试，但每个游戏应该涉及至少三个DC12或更高的检查。智力（{@skill History}）或智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查可以让角色找出游戏规则或分析对手，而智力（{@skill Investigation}）或魅力（{@skill Deception}）检查可以代表谨慎的游戏或狡猾的诈骗。角色每喝一次酒，赌博的检查DC就增加1。",
	"If a character fails all the checks for a game, they lose their 3 tokens and owe another 3. If the character fails more than half their checks, they lose their 3 tokens and owe 1 token. If they succeed on all checks, they keep their tokens and gain 2 tokens. This is a great way to lose money, but if a character beats the odds and wins more than three times in a row, the dealer for the game declares that it needs to go on its dinner break (despite being a skeleton).": "如果一个角色在一场比赛中没有通过所有的检查，他们就会失去3个代币，并欠下另外3个。如果角色的检查失败超过一半，他们会失去3个代币并欠1个代币。如果他们所有的检查都成功了，他们保留他们的代币并获得2个代币。这是一个很好的输钱方式，但如果一个角色击败了赔率，连续赢了三次以上，游戏的庄家就会宣布它需要去吃饭休息了（尽管是个骷髅）。",
	"One side of the gambling pit features banks of strange clockwork machines, each with a large red lever and a slot for tokens. These machines promise great fun, surrounded by colorful lights and amazing sounds. They also drain an average of 3 tokens for every minute of play.": "赌坑的一边是一排排奇怪的发条机器，每台机器都有一个大的红色杠杆和一个投币口。这些机器被五颜六色的灯光和惊人的声音包围，保证了极大的乐趣。它们每玩一分钟就会耗尽平均3个代币。",
	"The inebriated patrons are too focused on their gambling to talk to any characters who aren't also in the game. A character who gambles can strike up a conversation at the table, learning three pieces of information for each game they play, chosen from the following revelations:": "醉醺醺的食客们太专注于他们的赌博了，以至于无法与任何不在游戏中的角色交谈。赌博的角色可以在赌桌上进行对话，每玩一局就可以学到三条信息，从以下启示中选择。",
	"Lottie's Palace has been in operation for over ten years. Before the casino was built, the cavern it was carved out of was home to a clan of duergar.": "洛蒂宫已经经营了十余年。在赌场建成之前，它所凿出的洞穴是一个duergar部族的家。",
	"When Lottie arrived, she offered the duergar jobs building her lair and minting tokens. When the casino was complete, Lottie fired her duergar work force but offered each of them a starter set of tokens as a severance package. The duergar took up gambling and drinking.": "当洛蒂到达时，她向duergar提供了建造其巢穴和铸造代币的工作。赌场建成后，洛蒂解雇了她的二人组工人，但向他们每个人提供了一套初始代币作为遣散费。二人组开始赌博和喝酒。",
	"Lottie employs only skeletons to work her palace, many of which were once duergar.": "洛蒂只雇用骷髅在她的宫殿里工作，其中许多骷髅曾经是杜尔加人。",
	"Some of the duergar decided to start up a town next to the casino and sell tokens at lower cost. They took on construction loans and named their town Fortune.": "一些duergar人决定在赌场旁边建立一个小镇，以较低的成本出售代币。他们办理了建筑贷款，并将他们的城镇命名为 \"财富\"。",

	"The tiny gems embedded into the ceiling are valuable if collected. With 1 minute of uninterrupted work, a character can collect 30 gp worth of gems, to a total of 3,000 gp for the entire area. The chances of the characters being able to work uninterrupted are left to your determination.": "嵌在天花板上的小宝石如果收集起来是很有价值的。不间断地工作1分钟，一个角色可以收集到价值30戈比的宝石，整个区域的总价值为3000戈比。人物能够不受干扰地工作的机会由你决定。",
	"A skeleton in a slinky dress behind the cashier window offers tokens for use at the tables. Each token costs 5 gp. The cashier also suggests purchasing \"super lucky tokens,\" which function identically to normal tokens for the low, low cost of 10 gp each. The L-stamped tokens are made of copper covered with a thin layer of gold, as the characters saw with the tokens found in Horn Enclave.": "收银窗口后面有一个穿着吊带裙的骷髅，提供代币在桌子上使用。每个代币的价格是5戈比。收银员还建议购买 \"超级幸运代币\"，其功能与普通代币相同，但每块代币的成本很低，只有10戈比。这些盖有L印章的令牌是由铜制成的，上面覆盖着一层薄薄的金子，就像人物在 \"角之国 \"发现的令牌那样。",
	"The cashier accepts any form of valuables as payment (excluding IOUs), which are taken to a huge chest on the far side of the room. Any nonliving matter placed into the chest is teleported to secret vaults located in a distant land.": "收银员接受任何形式的贵重物品作为付款（不包括欠条），这些物品被带到房间远处的一个巨大的箱子里。任何放在箱子里的非生物物质都会被传送到位于远方的秘密金库中。",
	"This club lounge is clearly the place to hang out. A sign on the wall says so. Huge fish tanks feature brightly colored fish and an octopus. Soft leather chairs provide a great place to sober up or to enjoy a delicious drink at the bar.": "这家俱乐部的休息室显然是聚会的地方。墙上的牌子是这么说的。巨大的鱼缸里有色彩鲜艳的鱼和一只章鱼。柔软的皮椅提供了一个清醒的好地方，或者在酒吧里享受美味的饮料。",
	"The skeleton bartender uses clockwork devices to shake rum drinks, peel fruit, blend fruit juices, and create souvenir flattened tokens (at a cost of 3 tokens). A door behind the bar leads to the kitchen. Characters who sit in the lounge are shown a menu whose only item is \"Delicious Meals\" for 3 tokens.": "骷髅酒保用发条装置摇动朗姆酒饮料，剥开水果，混合果汁，并制作纪念品扁担（费用为3个代币）。吧台后面的一扇门通向厨房。坐在休息室里的人物会看到一份菜单，其中唯一的项目是 \"美味的餐点\"，费用为3代币。",
	"A few duergar are in the lounge, taking a break from gambling and watching the three harpist skeletons on the stage. Chatting up these duergar can provide information as in the gambling hall, at a rate of 1 token per piece of information.": "有几个杜尔加人在休息室里，从赌博中抽身出来，观看舞台上的三个竖琴手骷髅。与这些人聊天可以提供信息，就像在赌博大厅一样，每条信息有1个代币。",
	"Strange clockwork devices prepare food here, all of them slicing, dicing, stirring, mixing, and cleaning in a frenzy. Any character watching the process notes that the fare looks particularly unhealthy, featuring questionable meats, past-their-prime vegetables, and copious amounts of lard. Skeletons come and go to pick up food and drop off dishes. They ignore any characters who don't get in the way.": "奇怪的发条装置在这里准备食物，所有这些装置都在疯狂地切片、切丁、搅拌、混合和清洗。任何观察这个过程的人都会注意到，这些食物看起来特别不健康，有问题的肉，过期的蔬菜，还有大量的猪油。骷髅们来来回回地取走食物，放下餐具。他们无视任何不碍事的人物。",
	"The door leading north into Lottie's domain is not locked. Lottie assumes that anyone coming this way is a staff member on legitimate business, or is looking to die.": "向北进入洛蒂领地的门没有上锁。洛蒂认为，任何从这里来的人都是有合法业务的工作人员，或者是来找死的。",
	"The clockwork machinery in this area generates power for the casino and controls all the other clockwork in the place. The heavy iron door is set with a large lock and a dangerous trap, which sprays anyone who tries to pick the lock with a potent contact poison. The trap can be detected with a successful DC 16 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Investigation}) check and disarmed with a DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check or Dexterity check using thieves' tools. If the lock is picked without disabling the trap, the character picking it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 ({@dice 4d10}) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The trap resets automatically.": "这个区域的发条机械为赌场发电，并控制这里的所有其他发条。沉重的铁门上有一把大锁和一个危险的陷阱，它能给任何试图撬开锁的人喷洒一种强烈的接触性毒药。使用DC16智力({@skill Arcana}或{@skill Investigation})检查可以发现这个陷阱，使用DC14智力({@skill Arcana})检查或使用盗贼工具的灵巧检查可以解除陷阱。如果锁被撬开而没有解除陷阱，撬锁的角色必须进行DC14宪法救赎，如果救赎失败，将受到22({@dice 4d10})的毒药伤害，如果救赎成功，将受到一半的伤害。陷阱会自动复位。",

	"When the door is opened, read the following:": "当门被打开时，请阅读以下内容。",
	"The walls of this room are covered in conduits and glowing panels, many of which leak green fluid that flows toward a grated drain on the floor. In the center of the room stands a large glass globe on a stone pedestal. A brilliant ball of light pulses within the globe, which roils with dark energy bearing a disturbing resemblance to a map of the world.": "这个房间的墙壁上布满了导管和发光的面板，其中很多都漏出绿色的液体，流向地板上的栅栏式排水口。在房间的中心，一个大的玻璃球矗立在一个石制的基座上。一个明亮的光球在球内跳动，球内滚动着黑暗的能量，与世界地图有着令人不安的相似之处。",
	"Coiled around the globe is a long, serpentine creature that resembles a cross between a centipede and a crocodile—and which is made entirely of clockwork. It begins to move, but of more immediate notice is the translucent illusion of a lich in an evening gown lounging on a couch at the far side of the room. She wears an eyepatch and strokes a contented-looking dog as she speaks.": "盘绕着地球的是一条长长的蛇形生物，它类似于蜈蚣和鳄鱼的混合体，而且完全由发条制成。它开始移动，但更值得注意的是一个穿着晚礼服的半透明幻象，它正躺在房间远处的沙发上。她戴着眼罩，说话时抚摸着一只看起来很满足的狗。",
	"\"So, you thought to enter my palace and rob me, did you? Let's make it interesting, then. See if you can convince me to spare you before my clockwork pet destroys you all!\" The lich laughs as the clockwork creature lunges toward you.": "\"那么，你想进入我的宫殿抢劫我，是吗？那么，让我们让它变得有趣吧。看看你是否能说服我在我的发条宠物把你们都毁掉之前放过你们！\" 巫师笑着说，发条生物向你扑来。",

	"Any character fighting the {@creature clockwork behir|OoW} can see that the complex arrangement of its workings gives it a unique vulnerability. Any character within 5 feet of the construct can use an action to attempt a DC 14 Dexterity check using jeweler's tools or thieves' tools. On a success, the behir takes 15 bludgeoning damage as it components start to grind, and it is no longer able to recharge its lightning breath.": "任何与{@creature clockwork behir|OoW}战斗的角色都可以看到它复杂的工作安排给了它一个独特的弱点。任何在它5英尺范围内的角色都可以使用一个动作，尝试用珠宝商的工具或盗贼的工具进行DC14灵巧检查。如果成功，贝里尔就会在它的部件开始磨碎时受到15的重击伤害，而且它不再能够充实它的闪电气息。",
	"Lottie, her couch, and her dog are all a projected illusion. The lich nonetheless behaves like a classic villain, and is keen to reveal secrets during the battle if the characters try to explain themselves or do a deal with her. She is generally forthright in her answers (because she's proud of her brilliance and expects the characters to die), revealing any of the following information:": "洛蒂、她的沙发和她的狗都是投影出来的幻象。然而，这个巫师的行为却像一个典型的反派，如果角色试图解释自己或与她做交易，她会在战斗中热衷于透露秘密。她一般都会直截了当地回答（因为她为自己的聪明才智感到骄傲，并期待着角色们的死亡），透露出以下任何信息。",
	"Lottie created the orrery and its components, but she quickly grew to regret having done so, since the artifact could destroy the world if used improperly.": "洛蒂创造了手镯及其组件，但她很快就对这样做感到后悔，因为如果使用不当，这件文物可能会毁灭世界。",
	"When she realized how dangerous the orrery was, Lottie scattered its pieces and left the message in Horn Enclave that brought the characters here.": "当她意识到桔梗有多危险时，洛蒂把桔梗的碎片撒了出去，并在霍恩飞地留下了信息，把这些人物带到这里。",
	"She is aware that the orrery's components have been coming together, and that all the missing components and the orrery housing have now been found.": "她意识到，口轮机的部件一直在组合，现在已经找到了所有丢失的部件和口轮机外壳。",
	"She knows that the Six wants the orrery. That organization has bargained with terrible powers, which have instructed them in how to use the orrery and its components to open a portal to the Far Realm.": "她知道 \"六人帮 \"想要那块金字塔。该组织已经与可怕的力量讨价还价，这些力量指导他们如何使用口轮及其部件来打开一个通往远界的门户。",
	"If the portal is opened, the world will likely be destroyed. A shame, really, because Faerûn is such a profitable place.": "如果门户被打开，这个世界很可能会被摧毁。真的很遗憾，因为Faerûn是一个如此有利可图的地方。",
	"Even if the Six don't have all the orrery components, they'll be able to start their ritual given enough time, tapping into the power of the Far Realm from somewhere in the material world.": "即使六人组没有所有的矿石组件，只要有足够的时间，他们就能开始他们的仪式，从物质世界的某个地方挖掘出远界的力量。",

	"When the characters have learned all you want them to (or if they start to get the upper hand against the {@creature clockwork behir|OoW}), Lottie ends the conversation by saying, \"Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I have an appointment. I must go. Have fun dying!\" Her illusion then fades.": "当人物学到了你想让他们学到的一切（或者如果他们开始对{@creature clockwork behir|OoW}占了上风），洛蒂以说 \"哦，我非常抱歉 \"结束对话。我有个约会。我必须走了。祝你死得愉快！\" 然后她的幻觉就消失了。",
	"Talking to Lottie and not getting killed is the major point of this area. But characters who defeat the behir can remove the panels to access the clockwork machinery here. With a little experimentation, characters can deactivate any of the machinery in the casino, including the locks on the double doors into area 6. At your determination, tearing down the panels and attacking the clockwork behind them can have the same effect.": "与Lottie交谈并不被杀死是这个区域的主要内容。但打败贝希尔的角色可以拆除面板，进入这里的发条机械。只要稍加试验，人物就可以解除赌场中的任何机械，包括进入第6区的双门上的锁。根据你的判断，拆掉面板并攻击面板后面的发条可以产生同样的效果。",
	"The double doors to this huge chamber are covered in clockwork that functions as a lock. A successful DC 20 Dexterity check using jeweler's tools or thieves' tools unlocks the door. The characters can also open the doors from the machine room, or can use the kitchen to access this area. The skeleton staff in the front areas of the casino assume that anyone entering Lottie's private domain is either invited or is soon to be dead, and pay no mind to characters breaking in.": "这个巨大的房间的双门被覆盖在发条上，可以作为锁使用。使用珠宝商的工具或盗贼的工具，成功地进行DC20的灵巧检查，就可以打开门锁。角色们也可以从机房打开门，或者通过厨房进入这个区域。赌场前台的骷髅工作人员认为，任何进入洛蒂私人领地的人要么是被邀请的，要么是即将死去的，因此对闯入的人物毫不在意。",
	"The floor of this room is covered in red tiles surrounding a large swimming pool, the bottom of which glitters with thousands of gems. Fountains around the room spray water into the air that hangs as a fine mist.": "这个房间的地板上铺着红色瓷砖，围绕着一个大游泳池，池底闪烁着成千上万的宝石。房间周围的喷泉向空中喷水，水雾弥漫。",
	"Unlocked double doors across from the pool lead out to a hallway, while smaller doors lead to Lottie's office and to a changing room stocked with swim suits sized for every type of humanoid creature.": "泳池对面没有上锁的双门通向走廊，而较小的门则通向洛蒂的办公室和一个更衣室，里面有适合各种类型人形生物的泳衣。",
	"Flecks of gemstone embedded into the bottom of the pool are valuable if collected. With 1 minute of uninterrupted work, a character can collect 10 gp worth of gems, to a total of 1,000 gp for the entire pool.": "镶嵌在池底的宝石碎片如果被收集起来是很有价值的。通过1分钟的不间断工作，一个角色可以收集到价值10GP的宝石，整个池子的总价值为1000GP。",
	"This area can also contain other information of your choosing about the Six or the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}. If the characters have missed out on any key revelations up to now, or are having trouble with certain plot points, you can clear them up here and set the stage for a final question-and-answer session in the boardroom.": "这个区域也可以包含你选择的关于六人组或{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}的其他信息。如果人物到现在为止错过了任何关键的启示，或者对某些情节点有困难，你可以在这里把它们弄清楚，并为会议室里的最后问答环节做准备。",
	"Large clockwork double doors open by themselves as you approach, revealing a luxurious room decorated with fine art, rich carpets, several leather couches, and a boardroom table. Crystal balls sitting on pedestals around the room flicker and glow, and a huge fish tank swarms with unusual creatures. Some of them are even alive.": "当你走近时，大型发条双门自行打开，露出一个装饰着精美艺术品、丰富地毯、几张皮沙发和一张会议室桌子的豪华房间。房间周围基座上的水晶球闪烁着光芒，一个巨大的鱼缸里聚集着不寻常的生物。其中一些甚至是活的。",
	"Nine liches occupy the room, either lounging around or arguing at the table. All wear leisure suits or sun dresses, including one sitting comfortably with a dog in her lap. All appear surprised to see you.": "九个地衣占据了这个房间，有的在闲逛，有的在桌前争论。所有的人都穿着休闲服或太阳裙，包括一个舒适地坐着，腿上放着一只狗。所有人看到你都显得很惊讶。",
	"If the characters haven't encountered the illusory Lottie in {@area area 5|290|x}, the revelations in that section can be moved here, revealed by Lottie or the other liches. Some of the other liches have heard rumors of the Six's plots, and that the Six have seemingly bargained with terrible powers to learn how to use the orrery components to open a portal to the Far Realm. The commercial interests of these liches means that all understand how destroying the world is bad for business, so the Six must be stopped.": "如果角色们没有在{@area area 5|290|x}中遇到虚幻的洛蒂，那么该部分的启示可以移到这里，由洛蒂或其他地衣揭示。其他一些地衣听说了关于六人组阴谋的传闻，六人组似乎与可怕的力量讨价还价，以学习如何使用矿石组件来打开通往远界的入口。这些地衣的商业利益意味着他们都明白，破坏世界对商业是不利的，所以必须阻止六人组。",
	"The bored liches' thirst for entertainment might inspire them to ask the characters about what they do—and about Acquisitions Incorporated. Like Lottie, all these undead are focused on the limitless commercial aspects of immortal evil, and might be talked into partnerships with the franchise. The potential for such deals (and the potential risks in dealing with such powerful entities) is left to your imagination.": "无聊的地衣们对娱乐的渴求可能会激发他们去询问这些人物的工作，以及关于收购公司的情况。像洛蒂一样，所有这些亡灵都专注于不朽的邪恶的无限商业方面，并可能被说服与专营权合作。这种交易的潜力（以及与这种强大实体打交道的潜在风险）留给你想象。",
	"Depending on how their dealings with the liches go (and whether they did any damage to Lottie's Palace while getting to her), the characters can spend a few hours hanging out with the undead. Any prospective business dealings can be lined up, after which the liches order one last round of drinks, then kick the characters out of Lottie's Palace.": "根据他们与地衣的交易情况（以及他们在接近洛蒂宫时是否对她造成了任何损害），角色们可以花几个小时与亡灵们一起玩耍。任何潜在的商业交易都可以排上日程，之后地衣们会点上最后一轮酒，然后把角色们赶出洛蒂的宫殿。",
	"With the events of this episode complete, the characters attain 6th level! Leaving Lottie's Palace behind, they can return safely to their borrowed {@vehicle battle balloon|AI} or mobile headquarters, ready to try to figure out where the Six might be conducting their ritual—and how to stop it.": "随着本集事件的完成，人物达到了第6级！他们可以安全地回到他们的借来的{@vehicle battle balloon|AI}或移动总部。离开洛蒂的宫殿，他们可以安全地回到他们借来的{@vehicle battle balloon|AI}或移动总部，准备尝试找出六人帮可能正在进行仪式的地方，以及如何阻止它。",
	"Much of the break between episode 5 and 6 will be focused on determining the location of the Six's ritual site. The key clue to doing so is knowing that the ritual needs to be undertaken in a location where the planar boundaries are already thin, and where an existing planar portal is likely already in operation. Still, though the end of the world might be nigh, on the off chance that the characters are successful in stopping the Six's plans, they'll have bills to pay.": "第五集和第六集之间的大部分休息时间将集中在确定六人组的仪式地点上。这样做的关键线索是知道仪式需要在一个平面边界已经很薄的地方进行，而且现有的平面门户很可能已经在运行。尽管如此，尽管世界末日可能已经临近，但如果角色们成功地阻止了六人帮的计划，他们就会有账单需要支付。",
	"As the endgame approaches, the time the characters have spent with the orrery and its component pieces can grant the necessary insight to build a detector that can sense portals or planar disturbances. A portalometer, if you will. The research or scrutineering activities can help the characters uncover the necessary information or tools, while the crafting a magic item activity can cover the construction of the portalometer.": "随着终局的临近，角色们与口轮及其部件相处的时间可以赋予他们必要的洞察力，以建立一个可以感知门户或平面干扰的探测器。如果你愿意的话，可以说是一个传送门仪。研究或检查活动可以帮助人物发现必要的信息或工具，而制作魔法物品的活动可以涵盖传送门仪的建造。",
	"The details of the portalometer are left to the imaginations of the players (including coming up with a better name if they like). The detector might take the form of a magical receptacle allowing one or more orrery components to function as a compass, a divination window tapping into planar disruptions to show brief glimpses of possible locations, or any other device channeling suitable magic.": "门户仪的细节留给玩家想象（包括想出一个更好的名字，如果他们喜欢）。探测器的形式可以是一个神奇的容器，允许一个或多个轨道组件作为指南针使用；一个占卜窗口，用于探测平面干扰，以显示可能的地点的简短一瞥；或者任何其他引导适当魔法的装置。",
	"The time necessary to locate the ritual site is left to your determination. If the characters are anxious to cut to the chase, you can have a successfully created portalometer lead them straight to the site. In a pinch, you could even say that any orrery components the characters still possess become attuned to the ritual as Splugoth prepares it, allowing the characters to triangulate the ritual site's location. For more build up, you can set up a search involving side treks, which might cover the length and breadth of the Sword Coast as the characters make use of their mobile franchise headquarters.": "找到祭祀地点所需的时间由你决定。如果角色们急于直奔主题，你可以让一个成功创建的传送门引导他们直接到达现场。在紧要关头，你甚至可以说，在斯普鲁戈斯准备仪式的时候，角色们仍然拥有的任何ORRERY组件都会与仪式相适应，从而使角色们能够确定仪式地点的三角位置。为了更多的积累，你可以设置一个涉及到侧面跋涉的搜索，当人物利用他们的移动特许经营总部时，可能会覆盖剑海岸的长度和广度。",
	"These side trek missions might tie in to improving the magic of the portalometer and involving tracking down lore or components. Or the characters could discover several possible locations for the Six's ritual, then investigate and eliminate false leads before finding the real site. One such side trek is detailed in \"{@area The Moon Glade|2b0|x}\" in {@adventure episode 6|OoW|6}, and you can add similar events as you wish.": "这些侧面的跋涉任务可能与提高传送门计的魔力有关，并涉及追踪传说或组件。或者人物可以发现六人组仪式的几个可能地点，然后在找到真正的地点之前进行调查并排除错误的线索。在(%%)的\"{@area The Moon Glade|2b0|x} \"中详细介绍了一个这样的侧翼跋涉，你可以根据自己的意愿添加类似的事件。",
	"Any number of downtime and franchise activities—from research to schmoozing to shady business practices—can be used by characters seeking to learn more about the ritual or how best to take the fight to the Six. For any tasks in which the outcome includes a complication due to a rival, the Six could be attempting to undermine the characters' franchise to eliminate their threat.": "任何数量的停工和特许经营活动--从研究到讨好到阴暗的商业行为--都可以被寻求了解更多关于仪式或如何最好地与六人帮作战的角色所利用。在任何任务中，如果结果包括因对手而产生的复杂情况，六人帮可能试图破坏人物的特许经营权，以消除他们的威胁。",
	"Even as the characters are working on locating the ritual site, they might use the explore territory franchise activity to interact with local customers and allies to strengthen the franchise. A group of merchants might want to sell branded gear manufactured by the liches the characters met at Lottie's, creating additional business opportunities or allowing the characters to follow up on previous negotiations with the liches.": "即使人物在努力寻找祭祀地点，他们也可以利用探索领土的特许经营活动，与当地的客户和盟友互动，以加强特许经营。一群商人可能想出售他们在Lottie's遇到的地衣制造的品牌装备，从而创造更多的商业机会，或者让人物继续跟进之前与地衣的谈判。",
	"Having recently interacted with several powerful organizations—including Lottie's lich alliance, the Six, and Dran Enterprises—the characters might be bursting with ideas for fine-tuning their franchise and headquarters before the final showdown. This might involve organizational restructuring, headquarters modifications, upgraded magic, and other activities meant to grant the franchise an edge in the coming fight.": "最近与几个强大的组织--包括洛蒂的巫师联盟、六人帮和德兰企业--互动后，人物可能会在最后的决战前迸发出微调其特许经营权和总部的想法。这可能涉及到组织结构的重组、总部的修改、魔法的升级，以及其他旨在为特许经营权在即将到来的战斗中提供优势的活动。",
	"Engaging in shady business practices or outright crime during downtime might result in more than financial reward for the characters. With a suitable degree of success, such activities can bring the characters into contact with agents of the Six. Likewise, the characters might use the cover of criminal activity to infiltrate or expose the Six, or they could use carousing or other social activities to contact an ally or operative of the organization.": "在停工期间从事不正当的商业行为或公然犯罪，可能会给人物带来比经济回报更多的好处。如果成功的话，这些活动可以使人物与六人帮的特工接触。同样地，人物可以利用犯罪活动的掩护来渗透或暴露六人帮，或者他们可以利用狂欢或其他社交活动来联系该组织的盟友或行动者。",
	"Any such interactions should automatically create complications to be resolved, with those complications revealing useful information concerning the Six's plots, the ritual site's possible location, and the defenses around the site.": "任何这样的互动都会自动产生需要解决的复杂问题，而这些复杂问题会揭示出有关六人组的情节、仪式地点的可能位置以及该地点周围的防御的有用信息。",
	"If the characters communicate with Head Office at any point during their downtime, it should be made clear that Acquisitions Incorporated is impressed by the franchise's success. Omin Dran does whatever he can to backstop the characters' efforts to find the ritual site, even as he directs other franchises and operatives to seek the site as well. (In the end, the characters will conveniently be the ones to locate the ritual site, but it should be clear that the entire organization takes the impending end of the world as seriously as they do.)": "如果角色们在停工期间的任何时候与总部沟通，应该明确指出收购公司对特许经营的成功印象深刻。奥明-德兰尽其所能地支持人物寻找仪式地点的努力，甚至他还指示其他专营机构和特工人员也要寻找该地点。(最后，这些人物将很方便地找到仪式地点，但应该清楚的是，整个组织对即将到来的世界末日和他们一样认真对待）。",
	"After a suitable amount of questing and research, the characters locate the ritual site, which they learn is in the small town of Red Larch. That settlement is the childhood home of Omin Dran and the stomping grounds of the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise known as the \"C\" Team, whose members have recently gone missing.": "经过适量的探索和研究，这些人物找到了仪式的地点，他们了解到这是在红落叶小镇上。该镇是奥明-德兰的童年故乡，也是被称为 \"C \"小组的收购公司的活动场所，其成员最近失踪了。",
	"The characters speed toward Red Larch, where they find foes allied with the Six guarding the Dran & Courtier inn. That otherwise quiet establishment has always possessed unusual magical qualities, but these have been warped by the slowly opening portal to the Far Realm. The characters can interact with the local townsfolk, learning that the members of the \"C\" Team entered the inn but have not returned. Likewise, the inn's co-owner and proprietor, Propha Dran, has not been seen since the planar strangeness suffusing the inn started.": "角色们飞快地朝红落叶松走去，在那里他们发现了与六人帮结盟的敌人在守卫德兰和库蒂尔旅馆。这家安静的旅馆一直拥有不寻常的魔力，但这些魔力已经被慢慢打开的通往远方世界的门户扭曲了。角色可以与当地居民互动，了解到 \"C \"小组的成员进入了旅馆，但还没有回来。同样地，旅馆的共同拥有者和经营者普罗帕德兰，自从弥漫在旅馆中的平面怪异现象开始，就再也没有出现过。",
	"When the characters enter, the Dran & Courtier appears normal at first. But opening any of its interior doors causes the entire site to transform under the watchful eye of an agent of the Six known as the Keymaster. A nightmare version of the Dran & Courtier is revealed, filled with aberrant horrors. Defeating the horrors of this incarnation of the inn returns the characters to the actual inn.": "当人物进入时，Dran & Courtier起初看起来很正常。但打开任何一扇内部的门，都会使整个场所在被称为 \"钥匙主人 \"的六人组特工的监视下发生变化。一个噩梦般的Dran & Courtier出现了，充满了反常的恐怖。打败这个旅店的恐怖，人物就会回到真正的旅店。",
	"A second transformation turns the characters into miniature heroes as they are greeted by Splugoth the Returned. On behalf of the Six, the wily goblin asks the characters to surrender their orrery components—and then releases {@creature Onyx|OoW}, the giant (relative to the characters) inn's cat, upon them. Successfully fleeing from {@creature Onyx|OoW} transforms the inn once more.": "第二次变身后，人物变成了微型英雄，迎接他们的是 \"回归者 \"斯普鲁戈斯。这个狡猾的小妖精代表六人组，要求角色交出他们的魔法阵部件--然后释放出{@creature Onyx|OoW}，这只巨大的（相对于角色而言）旅馆的猫，来对付他们。成功逃离{@creature Onyx|OoW}后，客栈再次发生变化。",
	"In the final stage, the characters discover the members of the \"C\" Team fallen in combat and must fight the horrid Far Realm creature that slew them. Doing so brings those NPC heroes back to life. Once the Keymaster has been subsequently bested, the characters can open a final door leading to a dark series of dimensional caverns—and the lair of an ancient deep crow. That terrible creature is sure to defeat the characters, unless they can determine that it's suffering from a deep depression and desperately seeks a mate. Successfully playing the part of deep crow relationship counselor allows the characters to continue on, finally reaching the portal site.": "在最后阶段，角色们发现 \"C \"队的成员在战斗中倒下，必须与杀死他们的可怕的远界生物战斗。这样做可以使这些NPC英雄复活。一旦钥匙主人随后被击败，角色们就可以打开最后一扇门，通往一系列黑暗的维度洞穴--以及一个古老的深海乌鸦的巢穴。那个可怕的生物肯定会打败角色，除非他们能确定它正遭受深度抑郁症的折磨，并急切地寻找伴侣。成功扮演深海乌鸦关系顾问的角色，可以让人物继续前进，最终到达传送门地点。",
	"Splugoth is in control of the ritual and has defenses in place to prevent the meddling characters from thwarting his plans. As the characters face off against a mutated Far Realm goblin horde, Splugoth's control of the orrery components that fuel the ritual lets him summon forth twisted, evil versions of some of Acquisitions Incorporated's most famous members. Oh, and there's a thing where the ritual keeps resurrecting Splugoth every time the characters kill him.": "斯普鲁哥特控制着仪式，并有防御措施来防止爱管闲事的人物挫败他的计划。当角色们面对变异的远界地精部落时，Splugoth对助长仪式的火炉组件的控制让他召唤出了一些收购公司最有名的成员的扭曲、邪恶版本。哦，还有一件事，那就是每次人物杀死斯普鲁哥斯时，仪式都会让他复活。",
	"In the end, clever thinking and a measure of luck might allow the heroes to keep Splugoth dead, seize control of the orrery components, and end the ritual. If victorious, the characters will earn accolades from Head Office for a job well done!": "最后，聪明的思维和一定程度的运气可能会让英雄们保持斯普鲁戈斯的死亡，夺取对神庙部件的控制权，并结束仪式。如果获得胜利，这些人物将因出色的工作而获得总部的嘉奖",
	"And the world will be safe from destruction. That's always a plus.": "而且世界将免遭破坏。这始终是一个优点。",
	"In the course of locating the ritual site (see \"{@area Franchise Downtime|2a1|x}\" in {@adventure episode 5|OoW|5}), the characters might travel to any number of locations, either to confirm that those locations are not the ritual site or to gain additional information or magic useful in the search for the real site. If you want to set up a prolonged search for the site, any of the following iconic locations along the Sword Coast might make an interesting stop for the characters. Each location offers the potential to gain information regarding sites known for planar disturbances or strange magic, or to seek lore and materials to refine the operation of the characters' portalometer.": "在寻找仪式地点的过程中（见{@adventure episode 5|OoW|5}中的\"{@area Franchise Downtime|2a1|x}\"），人物可能会前往任何数量的地点，要么确认这些地点不是仪式地点，要么获得额外的信息或对寻找真正地点有用的魔法。如果你想设置一个长期的寻找地点的过程，以下任何一个沿剑海岸的标志性地点都可能成为角色们有趣的一站。每个地方都有可能获得有关已知的平面干扰或奇怪的魔法的信息，或者寻找传说和材料来完善人物的传送门仪的操作。",
	"The many towers of the largest and most storied library in all Faerûn are the perfect place to search for clues leading to the location or nature of the ritual site, or to find instructions for crafting a portalometer. Gaining lore or befriending the monks of the library could reveal that someone else recently came to Candlekeep to inquire into the nature of portals to other dimensions. In fact, this representative of the Six was studying the very tomes the characters are now investigating!": "全法鲁恩最大、最富盛名的图书馆的许多塔楼，是寻找通往仪式地点或性质的线索，或寻找制作传送门仪的说明的最佳场所。获得传说或与图书馆的僧侣交好，可以发现最近还有人来到烛台镇，探究通往其他空间的传送门的本质。事实上，这位六人组的代表正在研究人物现在正在调查的那些书！他的名字是 \"六人组\"。",
	"To dial up the action in an otherwise studious scene, remember that research in Candlekeep is never entirely safe. Opening a particular book might lead to a pocket dimension, conjure up a fiend, or create any other distraction of your design. More information on {@book Candlekeep|SCAG|2|Candlekeep} can be found in the {@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|SCAG}.": "要想在原本的学习场景中增加动作，请记住，在Candlekeep的研究从来都不是完全安全的。打开一本特定的书可能会通向一个袖珍空间，召唤出一个恶魔，或者创造出你所设计的任何其他分心。关于{@book Candlekeep|SCAG|2|Candlekeep}的更多信息可以在{@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|SCAG}中找到。",
	"Depending on how much time the characters spent in Neverwinter in {@adventure episode 3|OoW|3}, they might have heard tales of how the Spellplague (the great magical devastation that tore across Faerûn more than a century ago) tore a large chasm through the city. This chasm (helpfully known as \"the Chasm\") has since been sealed, but pockets of blue spellfire and the warping effects of planar energy can often still be seen in the area.": "根据人物在永夜城度过的时间{@adventure episode 3|OoW|3}，他们可能听说过法术瘟疫（一个多世纪前横扫法鲁恩的巨大魔法破坏）是如何在城市中撕开一条巨大的鸿沟的故事。这条鸿沟（被称为 \"鸿沟\"）后来被封住了，但在该地区仍然可以看到一些蓝色的法术之火和平面能量的扭曲效应。",
	"The characters can make use of contacts from {@adventure episode 3|OoW|3} to determine that agents of the Six appeared recently in Neverwinter and were rumored to have been researching the magic of the Chasm. Tracking down any agents who remain might allow the characters to gain hints regarding the ritual's location. You might also decide that these Six agents have been warped by the latent energy of the Chasm, making them formidable and unpredictable foes.": "角色可以利用{@adventure episode 3|OoW|3}的联系人，确定六人帮的特工最近出现在永夜城，据传他们一直在研究鸿沟的魔法。追踪任何留下的特工可能会让角色获得关于仪式地点的提示。你也可以决定，这些六人组特工已经被鸿沟的潜在能量所扭曲，使他们成为可怕的、不可预测的敌人。",

	"This dread forest abutting the Sword Mountains is the demesne of the ancient green dragon Claugiyliamatar. That terrible and cruel beast—known as Old Gnawbone for her habit of flying over the forest with a corpse in her jaws as a light snack—has long dominated Kryptgarden with her evil presence.": "这片紧邻剑山的可怕森林是古老的绿龙克劳吉利阿玛塔尔的领地。那只可怕而残忍的野兽，因为她习惯在森林上空飞来飞去，嘴里叼着一具尸体作为轻食而被称为 \"老啃骨\"，长期以来一直以她邪恶的存在支配着克里特加登。",
	"The forest is also home to a dryad named Ishaldra, who studies how evil magic can alter locations in the world. She can help the characters learn how to detect powerful magical essences, but only if they can elude Claugiyliamatar and the other dark creatures that dwell within the forest.": "森林里还有一个叫伊莎德拉的干尸，她研究邪恶的魔法如何改变世界的位置。她可以帮助人物学习如何探测强大的魔法精华，但前提是他们必须躲开克劳吉利亚马特和其他居住在森林里的黑暗生物。",
	"More information on Kryptgarden and {@creature Claugiyliamatar|SKT} can be found in the adventures {@adventure Princes of the Apocalypse|PotA} and {@adventure Storm King's Thunder|SKT}.": "关于Kryptgarden和{@creature Claugiyliamatar|SKT}的更多信息可以在冒险{@adventure Princes of the Apocalypse|PotA}和{@adventure Storm King's Thunder|SKT}中找到。",
	"This section expands on one location the characters might journey to as part of their search for the Six's ritual site.": "本节阐述了人物在寻找六人帮仪式地点的过程中可能前往的一个地点。",
	"As the characters work to perfect their portalometer, they hear of a site deep in the High Forest not far from the Star Mounds, known as the Moon Glade. The waters of the Moon Glade rest upon an intersection of magical ley lines, tied to the weave of the world. The glade's waters are thick like mercury and said to have powerful properties of divination. The characters might also learn that the glade is protected by a powerful natural guardian. Or you could keep that information to yourself.": "当这些人物努力完善他们的传送门时，他们听说在离星丘不远的高级森林深处有一个地方，被称为 \"月之谷\"。月亮湿地的水域位于神奇的雷线交汇处，与世界的编织紧密相连。沼泽地的水像水银一样浓稠，据说具有强大的占卜功能。角色们还可能会了解到，这片沼泽地受到一个强大的自然守护者的保护。或者你也可以把这些信息留给自己。",
	"The characters can use their mobile headquarters to reach the Moon Glade easily enough. When they finally arrive at the site, read the following:": "角色们可以使用他们的移动总部，很容易就能到达月光集市。当他们最终到达该地时，请阅读以下内容。",
	"The Moon Glade is a secluded clearing, roughly eighty feet in diameter, with half that space taken up by the pool of water at its center. Huge ancient trees around the perimeter tower overhead, allowing only a narrow slice of sky to illuminate the pool's silvery surface. The pool is surrounded by a circle of huge standing stones, all inscribed with strange writing.": "月亮谷是一块僻静的空地，直径大约八十英尺，其中一半的空间被中心的水潭占据了。周围巨大的古树高耸入云，只允许狭长的天空照亮水池的银色表面。池子周围有一圈巨大的立石，上面都刻着奇怪的文字。",
	"Anyone able to read Druidic can read the writing on the stones, all of which makes reference to divination and magic. The stones of the pool were brought here by visiting druids using large beasts or magical transportation, but any magic they might possess is dormant during this encounter.": "任何能读懂德鲁伊语的人都能读懂石头上的文字，这些文字都提到了占卜和魔法。池子里的石头是由来访的德鲁伊用大型野兽或魔法运输工具带到这里的，但他们可能拥有的任何魔法在这次遭遇中都处于休眠状态。",
	"Garalel initiates combat by animating trees, following up with her Glimpse of the Beyond feature. Characters can see that her bark is covered in dark, foul-smelling moss. A successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Nature}) check identifies the bark as magically tainted. Dealing damage to Garalel harms her but also breaks off large pieces of the tainted bark and moss. When she is reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, enough corrupted bark has been sloughed off that the treant regains her senses and stops fighting.": "加拉里尔通过使树木生动化来发起战斗，然后用她的 \"瞥见外面 \"的功能进行跟进。角色可以看到她的树皮上覆盖着黑暗、恶臭的苔藓。成功通过DC12智力（{@skill Arcana}或{@skill Nature}）检查，就可以确定树皮是被魔法污染的。对Garalel造成的伤害会使她受伤，但也会使受污染的树皮和苔藓大块脱落。当她的生命值减少到30点或更少时，已经有足够多的腐败树皮被剥离，树人恢复了她的感觉并停止战斗。",
	"A character can also use an action to throw water from the pool onto Garalel. Each time she is splashed so, it helps cleanse the dark magic binding her and increases the hit point total at which she regains her senses by 10.": "一个角色也可以用一个动作将池子里的水扔到加拉里尔身上。每次她被这样泼水，都有助于净化束缚她的黑暗魔法，并使她恢复感觉时的总命中率增加10。",
	"If Garalel regains her senses, she apologizes profusely. She allows the characters to approach the pool and tells them how the members of the Six used its waters to determine the ideal location for a dark ritual. Knowing that their actions contaminated the pool, she drew that corruption into herself instead.": "如果加勒尔恢复了理智，她会深深地道歉。她允许人物接近水池，并告诉他们六人帮成员如何利用水池的水来确定举行黑暗仪式的理想地点。她知道他们的行为污染了池子，所以她把这种腐败引向了自己。",
	"What the characters get out of this side trek depends on where it fits in the longer process of perfecting a portalometer or eliminating possible ritual sites. Depending on the goal, Garalel can allow the characters to use the pool's divination power to seek the ritual site, to take a sample of the glade's magical waters for use in their portalometer, or what have you.": "角色们从这次旅行中得到什么，取决于它在完善传送门仪或消除可能的仪式地点的长期过程中的位置。根据目标的不同，加拉尔可以允许角色使用水池的占卜能力来寻找仪式地点，或者取用绿地的魔水样本来用于他们的传送门计，或者其他什么。",
	"At whatever point in the search process you deem appropriate, the characters narrow down the search for the ritual site to a final location: the settlement of Red Larch on the western side of the Dessarin Valley. This small town services passing caravans and has a large quarry from which local folk mine marble favored by the wealthy of Waterdeep. A wagon can reach Waterdeep from Red Larch in seven days, and the town of Phandalin is six days away on foot.": "在你认为合适的搜索过程中，角色们将寻找祭祀地点的范围缩小到了最后一个地点：德萨林谷西侧的红落叶松定居点。这个小镇为过往的商队提供服务，并有一个大型采石场，当地人在那里开采沃特德普富人喜欢的大理石。一辆马车可以在七天内从红松镇到达沃特德，而步行到范达林镇需要六天。",
	"Red Larch is also the hometown of Omin Dran and the location of the Dran family business—the Dran & Courtier inn and restaurant. As the characters soon discover, this is not a coincidence. The {@adventure Princes of the Apocalypse|PotA} adventure contains more information on Red Larch and the surrounding region. As with Phandalin, this version of Red Larch is set about five years later than that earlier adventure.": "红落叶松也是奥明-德兰的故乡，也是德兰家族生意的所在地--德兰和库蒂尔旅馆和餐馆。正如角色们很快发现的那样，这并不是一个巧合。{@adventure Princes of the Apocalypse|PotA}冒险包含了更多关于红落叶松和周围地区的信息。与范达林一样，这个版本的红落叶松的背景比早期的冒险要晚五年左右。",
	"How the characters arrive in Red Larch is likely determined by what they suspect or have learned regarding the defenses the Six have set up around the ritual. They might choose a stealthy incursion in the dead of night, to roar straight in aboard a mobile franchise headquarters at midday, or any approach in between. But however they first enter the town, the characters quickly confirm that the Six's ritual is already underway.": "角色如何到达红叶松，可能取决于他们对六人帮在仪式周围设置的防御措施的怀疑或了解。他们可能会选择在夜深人静时隐秘地入侵，也可能在正午时分乘坐移动的特许经营总部直接进入，或者采取两者之间的任何方法。但无论他们第一次进入小镇，角色们都会很快确认六人帮的仪式已经开始了。",
	"Something is seriously wrong in Red Larch. The Dran & Courtier inn can be seen at the crossroads near the center of town easily enough. But the beams of purple energy emanating from the establishment are decidedly unusual, as is the presence of frightened townsfolk corralled in a pen nearby. Then, of course, there's the small force of bugbears guarding the pen and the gnolls surrounding the inn. That doesn't look right at all.": "红落叶城出了严重的问题。在镇中心附近的十字路口，很容易就能看到 \"德兰与库蒂尔 \"旅馆。但是，从旅馆里发出的紫色能量束显然是不寻常的，就像附近的围栏里有受惊的镇民一样。然后，当然，还有守卫围栏的一小队虫族和包围旅馆的地精。这看起来一点都不对。",
	"Haeleeya is glad to hand the characters her captive bugbear, which is happy to tell the characters everything it knows in exchange for staying alive. It tells how the bugbears were employed by the Six and ordered to round up twenty captives in case the Six needed them for some ritual, though it knows nothing more than that.": "Haeleeya很高兴地把她俘虏的虫子交给这些人物，虫子很高兴地告诉这些人物它所知道的一切，以换取他们的生命。它讲述了虫熊是如何被六人帮雇佣的，并被命令围捕20名俘虏，以备六人帮需要他们进行某种仪式，不过它知道的也就只有这些了。",
	"As you draw closer, you see the sign marking the Dran & Courtier swinging slowly despite the absence of any breeze. Purple light continues to seep out through roof tiles, shuttered windows, and the closed front door.": "当你走近时，你看到尽管没有任何微风，标志着Dran & Courtier的招牌仍在缓慢摆动。紫色的光线继续从屋顶的瓦片、百叶窗和紧闭的前门中渗出。",
	"Even in daylight, the building is shrouded by shadows, as if every part of the inn is somehow in the shade. Ringing the building are twenty {@creature Gnoll||gnolls}, arranged in four packs of five. Even the fearless gnolls are weirded out by the strange lights emanating from the inn. The characters can engage the gnolls head-on or attempt to take them out stealthily. Because the mercenaries are on edge, they can be easily distracted by a fire, recruiting NPCs to draw them off, illusions, or other clever strategies.": "即使在白天，这座建筑也被阴影所笼罩，仿佛客栈的每个部分都在某种程度上处于阴暗之中。环绕建筑的是20个{@creature Gnoll||gnolls}，五人一组，排列成四组。即使是无畏的地精也被客栈里发出的奇怪灯光吓到了。人物可以与地精正面交锋，也可以尝试隐蔽地干掉它们。因为佣兵们都很紧张，所以他们可以很容易地被火引开，招募NPC来引开他们，用幻觉或其他聪明的策略。",
	"Once the gnolls have been dealt with, the characters are free to enter the Dran & Courtier. The incursion of the inn and restaurant plays out as four distinct stages, each channeling a unique version of the establishment—and forcing the characters to face off against the effects of the dark magic churning within.": "一旦解决了地精，人物就可以自由地进入德兰和库蒂尔。对旅店和餐馆的入侵分为四个不同的阶段，每个阶段都有一个独特的场所--迫使角色们面对内部汹涌的黑暗魔法的影响。",
	"The Dran & Courtier is normally a fine inn run by Prophetess \"Propha\" Dran, who happens to be Omin Dran's mother, and her wife, Audra Courtier. The inn is a favorite of locals and travelers alike, but it also serves another purpose. When someone carrying an acorn whose cap is dipped in gold (usually given to them by Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office) passes through the door, they end up in an extradimensional version of the inn known as the Test Market.": "德兰和库蒂尔通常是一家精致的客栈，由女先知 \"普罗帕 \"德兰（恰好是奥明-德兰的母亲）和她的妻子奥德拉-库蒂尔经营。这家旅馆是当地人和旅行者的最爱，但它也有另一个目的。当有人带着一个帽子上沾满金子的橡子（通常是由收购公司总部给他们的）经过这扇门时，他们最终会进入一个被称为 \"测试市场 \"的超维度的客栈。",
	"The Test Market is meant to test new recruits to Acquisitions Incorporated, and it has several known versions. The multifaceted extradimensional nature of the Dran & Courtier makes it an ideal location for the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} to channel the extraplanar magic of the Six's ritual. A convenient number of days before the characters discovered the portal site, Splugoth accessed the extradimensional space and began the process of opening the portal. Energy from the Far Realm has infused several versions of the Test Market, making them even more dangerous than usual—including one version that has already defeated the \"C\" Team.": "测试市场是为了测试收购公司的新员工，它有几个已知的版本。德兰与库尔蒂尔的多面性使其成为{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}引导六人组仪式的星外魔法的理想地点。在人物发现传送门地点的方便几天前，斯普鲁戈斯进入了超维空间，开始了打开传送门的过程。来自远界的能量注入了几个版本的测试市场，使它们比平时更加危险--包括一个已经击败了 \"C \"小组的版本。",
	"Map 6.1 shows the layout of this episode's Test Market versions of the Dran & Courtier.": "地图6.1显示了本集《德兰与库尔蒂亚》测试市场版本的布局。",
	"One of the seemingly ordinary inhabitants of the inn is an agent of the Six. Known as the Keymaster, the agent is a {@creature doppelganger} presently posing as Prophetess \"Propha\" Dran (see {@area area 3|2cb|x}). The doppelganger holds a portal key that allows it to select which version of the Test Market the characters access when they open one of the inn's interior doors. It does so in the hope of destroying anyone attempting to interfere with Splugoth's ritual.": "旅店里的一个看似普通的居民是六人帮的一个特工。这名特工被称为 \"钥匙主人\"，是一个{@creature doppelganger}目前冒充先知 \"普罗帕 \"德兰的人（见{@area area 3|2cb|x}）。这个二重身持有一把传送门钥匙，当人物打开旅馆的内部大门时，它可以选择进入哪个版本的测试市场。它这样做是希望摧毁任何试图干扰斯普鲁哥斯仪式的人。",
	"The Keymaster runs the characters through new versions of the warped Test Market until its identity is discovered. Once caught, the Keymaster can be forced to open the inn's basement door—revealing the dimensional caverns leading to the ritual site.": "钥匙主人通过新版本的扭曲的测试市场让角色们运行，直到发现其身份。一旦被抓住，钥匙主人就会被迫打开旅馆的地下室大门--揭开通往仪式现场的维度洞穴。",
	"Until the characters confront the Keymaster, they advance to the next stage of the Test Market every time they open a door within the default version of the inn. Opened doors remain open, so the characters can explore the rooms beyond when they return from whatever stage is triggered by opening the door. Any treasure or other objects claimed in a stage stay with the characters.": "在人物面对钥匙主人之前，每当他们在默认版本的旅馆中打开一扇门，就会进入测试市场的下一个阶段。被打开的门仍然是开放的，所以当他们从打开门所触发的任何阶段返回时，他们可以探索后面的房间。在一个阶段中获得的任何财宝或其他物品都会留在人物身上。",
	"The Test Market is not advanced when NPCs open the doors, since the Keymaster has control of the inn's magic. As such, the NPCs stuck in the main stage (see below) wander around the inn as they please. If calculating characters think to have an NPC open a door for them, it advances the Test Market to the next stage for them only, plus any NPCs that appear in the next stage.": "当NPC打开门时，测试市场并不先进，因为钥匙主人控制着旅馆的魔法。因此，卡在主舞台上的NPC（见下文）在客栈里随意游荡。如果计算中的人物想到让NPC为他们开门，就会使测试市场推进到下一阶段，只为他们，加上下一阶段出现的任何NPC。",
	"Stop by the Dran & Courtier if you're ever in Red Larch. In late summer, preferably. Come hungry.": "如果你在红落叶山，请到德兰和库尔蒂尔餐厅来。最好是在夏末。饿着肚子来吧。",
	"The inn's windows, chimneys, and other access points are all magically sealed. They cannot be opened from inside or out, and are impervious to spells and damage. The main door opens easily, but a wall of purple light blocks the view inside. Characters must step through the door to take stock of what lies beyond.": "旅店的窗户、烟囱和其他通道都被魔法密封。它们不能从里面或外面打开，而且不受法术和损害的影响。大门很容易打开，但一堵紫色的光墙挡住了里面的视野。角色必须穿过这扇门，才能看到门外的情况。",
	"The door of the Dran & Courtier is neither locked nor trapped—though the building emanates strange sounds, shakes as though it's falling apart, and continues to radiate a strange purple energy. As soon as you step through the door, though, all the strangeness stops.": "Dran & Courtier的门既没有上锁，也没有被困住--尽管这栋建筑发出奇怪的声音，摇晃得好像要散架一样，并持续散发着一种奇怪的紫色能量。不过，当你踏进这扇门时，所有的怪异都停止了。",
	"You see a perfectly ordinary inn, its common room featuring five round tables. Two of those tables are occupied by typical patrons, while two other people stand at the bar. A sleek house cat sizes you up as it paces across the floor, stalking some unseen prey. Oddly, the interior space of the inn seems slightly out of sync with the exterior—almost as if you've stepped into somewhere else. But even as you ponder this, the front door closes behind you, and you notice everyone in the inn glance your way expectantly.": "你看到一家非常普通的旅馆，它的公共房间里有五张圆桌。其中两张桌子被典型的顾客占据，而另外两个人站在吧台前。一只光滑的家猫在地板上踱来踱去，盯着一些看不见的猎物，对你进行观察。奇怪的是，旅店的内部空间似乎与外部空间略微不协调--几乎就像你走进了别的地方。但就在你思考这个问题时，前门在你身后关上了，你注意到旅店里的每个人都期待地朝你这边看。",
	"The door closes behind the characters as soon as they are all inside. Powerful magic imbued into the door makes it impossible to hold it open, as it pushes anything blocking it out of the way.

Just get everyone inside. You'll make it work.": "当人物都在里面时，门就会在他们身后关闭。灌注在门里的强大魔法使人无法把门打开，因为它把任何阻挡它的东西都推开了。试图守住门的人物突然变得心烦意乱，不记得他们为什么要这样做。拒绝进入旅店的角色感到奇怪，不得不向前走。只要让大家进去。你会成功的。",

	"Propha overheard Splugoth talk about the ritual being undertaken in some location called the dimensional caverns. He also bragged that the caverns are guarded by a monster known as an ancient deep crow. Propha can fill the characters in on deep crow lore if they're unfamiliar with those creatures (see {@book appendix B|AI|4}), and makes it clear that even one ancient deep crow is a threat the characters cannot expect to overcome by normal means.": "普罗普哈无意中听到斯普鲁哥斯谈到在某个叫做维度洞穴的地方进行仪式。他还吹嘘说，洞穴由一种被称为古老的深海乌鸦的怪物守护着。如果角色不熟悉这些生物，普罗帕哈可以让他们了解深海乌鸦的传说（见{@book appendix B|AI|4}），并明确指出，即使是一只古代深海乌鸦，角色也不能指望通过正常手段克服的威胁。",

	"Shortly after finding Propha, reality shimmers around the characters and they are returned to the default inn of stage 1.

No magic available to the characters can return them to life, and any magic carried by those adventurers is mysteriously inert. If the characters want to loot the bodies, any treasure they might be carrying is left to your determination. There is nothing of value in any of the bedrooms.": "对 \"C \"小组成员的调查证实，他们确实已经死了。角色们可用的任何魔法都无法使他们复活，而且这些冒险者携带的任何魔法都神秘地失去了作用。如果角色们想要掠夺尸体，他们可能携带的任何宝物都由你来决定。卧室里没有任何有价值的东西。",

	"The inn changes to resemble one of the other inns or taverns the characters have been to previously during the adventure (the Stonehill Inn or the Sleeping Giant in Phandalin, the Fishbone Tavern in Luskan, and so on). The patrons are people the characters have met before, but one of those patrons tells the characters that someone in the establishment is not who they appear to be. Finding the impersonator reveals a powerful monster of your determination, whose defeat ends the stage.": "客栈会改变，以类似于人物在冒险过程中曾经去过的其他客栈或酒馆（Phandalin的Stonehill Inn或Sleeping Giant，Luskan的Fishbone Tavern，等等）。食客们都是人物以前见过的人，但其中一个食客告诉人物，这个地方的某个人不是他们表面上的人。找到这个冒名顶替的人，就会发现一个你决心的强大怪物，打败他就可以结束这个阶段。",
	"No people are found in the Dran & Courtier, but a number of inanimate objects are sitting in chairs where people once were.

	"This Test Market is a puzzle in which the first letter in the name of each object that was formerly a person must be scrambled to determine a password. You choose the password, then choose the nature of the objects so that their names provide the needed letters. For example, the password \"lamp\" could be created from a lock, an arrow, a mirror, and a piton. When the password is spoken, the stage ends.": "这个 \"测试市场 \"是一个谜题，必须对每个以前是人的物体名称中的第一个字母进行扰乱，以确定一个密码。你选择密码，然后选择物体的性质，使它们的名字提供所需的字母。例如，密码 \"灯 \"可以由锁、箭、镜子和钉子组成。当口令被说出后，舞台就结束了。",
	"The tavern becomes the franchise's headquarters, which is under attack by agents of the Six! For even more chaos, each of the characters temporarily transforms into a franchise staff member using an NPC stat block, so that the players must use those NPCs to repel the attackers.

	"The tavern appears normal, but it holds three people who look exactly like Propha Dran and none of them are behind the bar. Each time a Propha touches a character or another patron, the person touched turns into a Propha in body and mind, with the players roleplaying that development as they see fit. Whether as themselves or as Propha, the characters must determine which is the original Propha (still secretly the Keymaster) and get it to touch the other Prophas, which turns them back to normal. Once everyone is their former self, the stage ends.": "酒馆看起来很正常，但里面有三个人，他们看起来和普罗帕德兰一模一样，而且都不在酒吧后面。每当一个普罗帕哈接触到一个角色或其他顾客时，被接触的人就会在身体和心灵上变成一个普罗帕哈，玩家可以根据自己的需要对这种发展进行角色扮演。无论是作为自己还是作为Propha，角色们必须确定哪个是原来的Propha（仍然是秘密的钥匙主人），并让它接触其他的Prophas，从而使他们恢复正常。一旦每个人都变成以前的自己，这个阶段就结束了。",
	"Every patron seen previously in the inn has a head resembling a fleshy ball surrounded by tentacles and a gaping maw where a face should be. These otherworldly creatures are tearing the inn apart and attempting to eat everything they can get their hands on—including the characters.": "之前在旅馆里看到的每个顾客都有一个类似于肉球的头，周围都是触手，脸部应该有一个大口。这些超凡脱俗的生物正在将旅店撕成碎片，并试图吃掉他们能得到的一切，包括人物。",
	"The characters appear behind the bar, with every patron in the inn shouting furiously at them regarding poor service. The patrons begin to hurl food at the characters: +4 to hit, 4 ({@dice 1d8}) bludgeoning damage. The patrons are immune to damage from any of the characters' normal attacks and spells. However, each patron is vulnerable to one type of food currently being hurled around the inn. If that type of food hits a patron, they immediately vanish. When all the patrons have been vanquished in this way, the stage ends.": "人物出现在吧台后面，客栈里的每一个顾客都在愤怒地对他们喊着服务不周。客人们开始向人物投掷食物。命中率+4，4({@dice 1d8})重击伤害。食客们对角色的普通攻击和法术的伤害是免疫的。然而，每个食客都容易受到目前在旅馆周围投掷的一种食物的伤害。如果这种食物击中一个顾客，他们会立即消失。当所有的食客都以这种方式被消灭时，该阶段结束。",
	"Whether as a result of information gathered during stages of the Test Market, magic brought to bear while talking to \"Propha,\" or simply adventurers' instinct, the characters eventually become aware of the Keymaster's identity. If this happens before the characters have triggered all the presented stages of the Test Market, that's fine. You can have the Keymaster flee through an interior door to generate a new stage (see below). Or you can ignore the later stages and let the characters capture the doppelganger (especially if the players are anxious to get to the ritual site as quickly as possible).": "无论是在测试市场的各个阶段收集到的信息，还是在与 \"Propha \"交谈时施展的魔法，或者仅仅是冒险者的直觉，角色们最终会意识到钥匙主人的身份。如果这发生在人物触发了测试市场的所有阶段之前，那也没什么。你可以让钥匙主人从内部的门逃走，从而产生一个新的阶段（见下文）。或者你可以忽略后面的阶段，让角色们抓住二重身（特别是如果玩家们急于尽快赶到仪式现场的话）。",
	"When the Keymaster's true nature is discovered, it shifts to its natural form and engages the characters in combat.

It repeats periodically, always far off in the distance.": "这条隧道持续了很久，感觉像是永远，然后天花板突然开始上升。墙壁上有一个高得不能再高的峡谷，峡谷慢慢变宽，空气变得炎热，充满了硫磺的气味。发光的岩浆喷口使一个巨大的洞穴充满了暗红色的光辉。从前面的某个地方，你听到一声低沉、回荡的鸣叫，听起来像是某种大鸟的叫声。它周期性地重复，总是在很远的地方。",
	"Set into a large cleft in the canyon wall is an enormous nest of sticks, bones, paper, and other debris. An immense black form resembling a crow shelters in the nest.

	"The inky black space above is now dotted by pulses of purple and green fire. The canyon narrows, then opens again into a cavern, where a broad sandstone rise is lit by sheets of green flame that scour the ceiling. Thin shelves of eroded rock emerge from the center of the rise to create a large central mesa. Ten other goblins stand guard around this promontory, which has twisting steps leading up to where Splugoth stands.": "上面墨黑的空间现在被紫色和绿色的火焰脉冲所点缀。峡谷变窄了，然后又打开了一个洞穴，那里有一个宽阔的砂岩高地，被绿色火焰的薄片照亮了天花板。被侵蚀的岩石的薄层从隆起的中心出现，形成一个巨大的中央山丘。其他十个地精在这个岬角周围站岗，岬角上有曲折的台阶，通往斯普鲁戈斯站立的地方。",
	"A sandstone pillar rises from the mesa before the goblin. Floating above it is the orrery, its clockwork components spinning rapidly, glowing with power. Behind Splugoth is a rift in reality—a purple wound in the world, beyond which you can see goblins with purple eyes, extra limbs, and other strange mutations. The Far Realm goblins push forward, trying to press through the portal and into your world.": "一根砂岩柱子从地精面前的山丘上升起。漂浮在它上面的是魔法阵，它的发条部件快速旋转着，闪耀着力量的光芒。在斯普鲁戈斯身后是现实中的一道裂缝--世界上的一道紫色伤口，在这道裂缝之外，你可以看到拥有紫色眼睛、额外肢体和其他奇怪变异的妖精。远界的妖精们向前推进，试图穿过门户，进入你的世界。",
	"Splugoth laughs. \"You are too late! The ritual is under my control, and now you must hear my most villainous speech! Oh, who am I kidding? Goblins, kill these meddlesome fools! And just to sway the odds, how about some ironic assistance for my minions?\" With a flourish, Splugoth manipulates one of the orrery's clockwork components. Four purple-black outlines begin to form before the rift—slowly taking the shape of characters you recognize.": "Splugoth笑了。\"你来的太晚了! 仪式在我的控制之下，现在你必须听我最恶毒的演讲！\"。哦，我在骗谁呢？哥布林们，杀了这些多管闲事的傻瓜！\"。而为了动摇胜算，给我的奴才们一些讽刺性的援助如何？\" 斯普鲁戈斯兴致勃勃地操纵着口轮机的一个发条部件。四个紫黑色的轮廓开始在裂缝前形成，慢慢地形成了你所认识的人物的形状。",
	"As the ritual approaches its end, the magic imbued into the orrery components senses the presence of the characters and works to thwart them. Drawing from the franchise's collective subconscious, the ritual manifests the most terrifying figures the characters can think of—their bosses.": "当仪式接近尾声时，被灌注在祭坛组件中的魔法感应到了人物的存在，并努力阻挠他们。仪式从特许经营的集体潜意识中提取，表现出角色们所能想到的最可怕的人物--他们的老板。",
	"At the start of combat, wraithlike Far Realm versions of Omin Dran, Jim Darkmagic, Môrgæn, and Viari appear in front of the planar rift.

	"Each Far Realm version of an Acquisitions Incorporated character is shaded purple-black, its eyes glowing yellow-gold. A Far Realm friend has all the information about the characters that Head Office knows, and uses that knowledge to be as effective as possible in combat.

	"As the characters fight, their primary goal will be to reach the top of the sandstone mesa, from which the orrery components and the ritual can be controlled. Characters can use the steps to reach the top, but those steps are warded against intruders (see below). Moreover, the Far Realm friends and the goblins fighting for Splugoth attempt to stop the characters from reaching the top at any cost.": "在人物战斗的过程中，他们的首要目标是到达砂岩山顶，从那里可以控制箭塔的部件和仪式。角色可以使用台阶到达顶部，但这些台阶被挡住了，以防止入侵者（见下文）。此外，远方世界的朋友和为斯普鲁哥斯而战的地精们试图不惜一切代价阻止角色到达山顶。",
	"Characters can climb to the top of the promontory, but the weathered sandstone crumbles easily. It takes a successful DC 14 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to reach the top, with climbing gear or a rope providing advantage on the check.": "人物可以爬到海角的顶端，但是风化的砂岩很容易碎裂。需要成功地进行DC14力量（{@skill Athletics}）检查才能到达顶部，攀登装备或绳索在检查中提供优势。",
	"The rift tearing reality apart hovers a few feet above the mesa and pulses with eldritch power.

	"Likewise, if Splugoth is brought back to life by the ritual, you can make it clear to the characters that seizing control of the orrery components can prevent this from happening. At your discretion, you might also limit how many times Splugoth can be returned to life in this manner.": "同样地，如果斯普鲁哥斯通过仪式复活了，你可以让角色们清楚地知道，夺取箭塔组件的控制权可以防止这种情况发生。根据你的判断，你也可以限制斯普鲁哥斯以这种方式复生的次数。",
	"During the fight, feel free to reward player ingenuity. Maybe a character attempts to baffle or seduce a Far Realm friend to remove that manifestation from the fight for the round. If it's roleplayed well enough and you think it might be fun, let it work.": "在战斗中，可以自由地奖励玩家的聪明才智。也许一个角色试图迷惑或引诱一个远古世界的朋友，让他在这一轮的战斗中消失。如果它的角色扮演足够好，而且你认为它可能很有趣，就让它发挥作用。",
	"The ritual takes its own turn on initiative count 1.

	"Depending on which components the Six managed to steal in episode 5, and whether the characters gave up other components to Splugoth in the Test Market, the ritual might be fueled by anything from a single component to all six components set into the orrery housing. While the ritual is in progress, the normal magic of the orrery components and housing does not function in the ritual cavern, even if a component is not being used in the ritual. The ritual works regardless of how many components are involved, but adding or removing pieces has an impact on the ritual's magic (see \"Adding Components\" and \"Removing Components\" below).": "根据六人组在第五集成功偷到的组件，以及角色们是否在测试市场上放弃了其他组件给斯普鲁戈斯，仪式可能由任何东西来推动，从单一的组件到所有六个组件都设置在兽皮箱中。当仪式进行时，即使在仪式中没有使用某个组件，祭坛组件和外壳的正常魔法也不会在祭坛洞穴中发挥作用。无论有多少组件，仪式都能正常进行，但添加或移除组件会对仪式的魔法产生影响（见下文 \"添加组件 \"和 \"移除组件\"）。",
	"Any of the components fueling the ritual can be removed as an action with a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check or Dexterity check using jeweler's tools or thieves' tools. A failed check results in a mishap (see below). Removing a component weakens the ritual, preventing it from summoning any goblins or raising Splugoth on its next turn. This can be done multiple times, until only one component or the orrery housing remains. The final piece can be removed only once the ritual has ended.": "使用珠宝商的工具或盗贼的工具，通过成功的DC12智力({@skill Arcana})检查或灵巧检查，可以作为一个行动来移除仪式的任何组件。检查失败会导致意外发生（见下文）。移除一个组件会削弱仪式，使其在下一回合无法召唤任何地精或复活斯普鲁哥特。这可以多次进行，直到只剩下一个部件或兽皮箱。只有在仪式结束后才能移除最后一个部件。",

	"If the characters were victorious, you can all celebrate a job well done! When the ritual ends, any remaining goblins surrender and beg for mercy (and jobs).

And wherever its pieces end up, the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} still has a will of its own, and might spawn additional adventures in the future.": "为了遵守对洛蒂的承诺，这些人物不得不再次将这个饰品拆开，并将其部件散落到很远的地方。但是，嘿，有时冒险家是健忘的。最后，奥明-德兰可能不得不宣布，总部将负责手镯的最终命运--尽管特许经营权可能当然有权保留一个最喜欢的计时器。(或两个。真的，谁能记住这些东西呢？)而且无论它的碎片最后在哪里，{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}仍然有自己的意志，并可能在未来产生更多的冒险。",

	"Even though \"The Orrery of the Wanderer\" is at an end, the characters should run downtime activities, both as a celebration of their victory (or to lessen the sting of a partial defeat) and to set the course for the campaign to come. The characters might enjoy changing cosmetic elements of their franchise headquarters to reflect their recent victories, spread their reputation as heroes, cement recent alliances, wrap up open plot hooks, or deal with debts or obligations incurred while saving the world.": "尽管 \"漫游者之家 \"已经结束了，但人物应该进行停工活动，这既是对胜利的庆祝（或减轻部分失败的刺痛），也是为接下来的活动设定方向。角色可能会喜欢改变他们的特许经营总部的外观元素，以反映他们最近的胜利，传播他们作为英雄的声誉，巩固最近的联盟，结束开放的情节钩子，或处理在拯救世界时产生的债务或义务。",
	"The characters' heroics might have changed the dynamic between Acquisitions Incorporated and Dran Enterprises, for good or ill. Likewise, a failed ritual deals the Six a severe setback, though Jeff Magic (Splugoth's lich boss) is still out there somewhere.

New rivals, new allies, and new opportunities are sure to make their presence known.": "这些人物的英雄事迹可能已经改变了收购公司和德兰企业之间的动态，无论好坏。同样，一个失败的仪式使六人组受到了严重的挫折，尽管杰夫-魔法（Splugoth的巫师老板）仍在某处。但无论六人组是立即复仇还是决定等待时机，对于收购公司的特许经营权来说，事情都不会平静太久。新的对手、新的盟友和新的机会肯定会让他们的存在变得更有意义。",

	"When the characters left the bodies of the dwarf wedding party at the end of {@adventure episode 5|OoW|5}, the dwarves immediately understood that they'd been possessed.

In the meantime, he makes a living by scribbling on pieces of parchment he scrounges from garbage heaps, selling them as maps to unwitting fools searching for places in Dock Ward.

	"The work of the gnome archmage Hoobur Gran'Shoop is a constant presence in episodes 2 and 3 of the adventure, even before his actual appearance toward the end of {@adventure episode 3|OoW|0}. Savvy players might note that the undead minions Hoobur creates to harry the party don't follow the standard rules by which a spellcaster character might create undead. Likewise, some of the creatures working for Hoobur do so in ways that aren't covered by {@spell dominate monster}.": "在冒险的第2和第3集中，侏儒大法师胡布尔·格兰肖普（Hoobur Gran'Shoop）的工作是一个持续的存在，甚至在{@adventure episode 3|OoW|0}末尾他实际出现之前。精明的玩家可能会注意到，胡布尔创造的不死手下并不遵循一个法术施法者角色可能创造不死生物的标准规则。同样，一些为胡布尔工作的生物以一种{@spell dominate monster}未涵盖的方式行事。",
	"The characters are 20 feet from the alley entrance when the old man—a seer named Kal Ruudheart (NG male human {@creature commoner})—is grabbed. The perpetrators are Big Gustava (NE female {@creature duergar}) and her friend who goes by the name {@creature Devil Dog|OoW} (CE female tiefling {@creature acolyte}). The two are street thieves trying to work their way up to larger scores. {@creature Devil Dog|OoW} uses the acolyte stat block with these racial traits:": "当老人——一位名叫卡尔·鲁德哈特（{@creature commoner} 中立善良 男性 人类 {@creature commoner}）的先知——被抓住时，这些角色距离小巷入口有20英尺。罪犯是大古斯塔娃（{@creature duergar} 中立邪恶 女性 {@creature duergar}）和她的朋友，她用名字 {@creature Devil Dog|OoW}（混沌邪恶 女性 鬼灵 {@creature acolyte}） 。这两人是街头小偷，试图通过小偷行为逐渐积攒更多财富。{@creature Devil Dog|OoW} 使用侍僧的属性表，带有以下种族特征：",

Otis works for the Gray Hands—members of the City Watch or the City Guard invited to join a special security force working directly for Vajra Safahr, the Blackstaff of Waterdeep.

	"Otis can be used as a wild card later in this episode of the adventure. For example, if the characters are faring poorly during the encounters under the warehouse, the halfling could follow and intervene on their behalf, healing {@condition unconscious} party members or dragging them away from danger.

	"The leader of the trio is Captain Mergen Truff (NG female elf {@creature veteran}), a laconic figure who would rather be doing \"real work\" than standing here warning off vagrants too foolish to avoid falling into a massive hole in the ground. Her companions are Orvis Torval (N male firbolg {@creature guard}) and Rosko Bosh (N male halfling {@creature guard}). Orvis and Rosko are new constables, not the sharpest swords in the armory, and as lazy as wizards who've used all their spell slots.

	"The two fishers drinking at a central table are Milo and Tortuk (both N male human {@creature Commoner||commoners}). Both are deep into their cups, lamenting their inability to find employment on the better fishing boats owned by Ship Baram.

Given the number of seedy sailors that call the City of Sails their home port, she knew that a shop helping pirates with limb replacements would always make money. However, she felt that a hook was more useful as a replacement for a leg (instead of the traditional peg leg), and that a peg was more useful to replace a lost hand.": "阿拉·剃刀舌（混沌善良的女性人类{@creature spy}，具有标志性的德兰企业员工特征；见“{@book Iconic Faction Features|AI|5|Iconic Faction Features}”在{@book appendix B|AI|5}中）作为德兰企业的员工，一切都很顺利。所以当她被这家组织解雇时，在卢斯坎残酷的环境中重新开始的需求激发了她的超乎寻常的想法。远远超出寻常。考虑到许多混混水手将城市之帆作为他们的母港，她知道一家帮助海盗进行肢体更换的商店总是能赚钱的。然而，她觉得用钩代替腿（而不是传统的木腿）更有用，用短木杆代替失去的手更实用。",
	"Velos the pirate (from the Fishbone tavern) is a potential customer for Arla, but many others can be found around the city.

If Dran Enterprises has been alerted to the characters' investigations, the strike team is already inside the shop when the party arrives, preparing to take Arla out.

This won't see the characters taken directly to the company's main headquarters, but could provide an alternative means of reaching {@i Dangerous Business}. Once on that ship, one of the spies might mistakenly open the portal door leading to the Far Realm horror, with the strike team members alone dragged into that deadly trap to allow the characters to gain their freedom. See \"{@area Infiltrating Dran Enterprises|1c2|x}\" for more information.": "如果整个队伍被击败或投降，霍夫曼可以下令让角色们保持活着，并被装载到一辆马车上，然后被带到德兰企业进行审问。这不会直接将角色们带到公司的总部，但可以提供另一种到达{@i Dangerous Business}的途径。一旦登上那艘船，其中一名间谍可能会错误地打开通往遥远领域恐怖之门的传送门，导致突击小队成员被单独拖入那个致命陷阱，让角色们获得自由。更多信息请参见\"{@area Infiltrating Dran Enterprises|1c2|x}\"。",
	"The area of the docks around the three ships is patrolled by two groups of Dran Enterprises operatives, each consisting of four {@creature Guard||guards} and four {@creature Mastiff||mastiffs}. Crates and equipment piled along the docks can provide cover, potentially allowing the characters to make a stealthy approach. Various booms and scaffolding can also grant access to the larger ships, from which the characters can work their way to {@i Dangerous Business}. The players might also devise any number of ways to talk their way on board. Dran Enterprises is often hiring, so the characters could pose as expert sailors or specialized consultants. Give the players and characters the freedom to develop a plan, gather information, and fail or succeed spectacularly!": "{@creature Guard||guards}和{@creature Mastiff||mastiffs}，每组四名，负责巡逻三艘船周围的码头区域。码头上堆放的货箱和设备可以提供掩护，有可能让角色们进行隐秘接近。各种吊杆和脚手架也可以让角色们进入更大的船只，从那里他们可以逐步接近{@i Dangerous Business}。玩家们也可以想出各种方法潜入。德兰企业经常招聘，所以角色们可以假扮成专业水手或专业顾问。给予玩家和角色们制定计划、收集信息、失败或成功的自由！",
	"Aside from his grievous head wound, the guard's body is untouched except where his shirt is torn over his chest. A successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check confirms that a brooch or pin was ripped from that location. If a character thinks to check, the size of the round metal pin claimed from Hoffman after the fight with the Dran Enterprises strike team matches the size of the torn hole. (If the characters didn't claim the pin from the strike team and you haven't already arranged for a replacement to be found, this guard has a second pin in his pocket.)": "除了他严重的头部伤口外，卫兵的身体没有受到伤害，只有他的衬衫在胸前被撕破的地方。成功的智力检定{@skill Investigation}检查确认从那个位置撕下了一个胸针或别针。如果角色想要检查，从与Dran Enterprises突击小组战斗后从霍夫曼那里夺回的圆形金属别针的大小与撕裂的洞口的大小相匹配。（如果角色没有从突击小组那里夺回别针，且你还没有安排找到替代品，这名卫兵口袋里有第二个别针。）",
	"Each portal door is made of reinforced iron. A successful DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check reveals that the doors are mundane, but that each is magically trapped. A {@spell detect magic} spell or similar effect reveals an aura of evocation on a door's latch. If a latch is opened by anyone not wearing the round metal pin bearing the symbol of Dran Enterprises, the trap goes off. Each creature within the room must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 ({@dice 3d10}) cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Each trap can be disarmed with a successful DC 13 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check or a Dexterity check using thieves' tools.": "每个传送门都由加固铁制成。成功的 DC 14 智力检定 {@skill Arcana} 揭示了门是平凡的，但每个都被魔法陷阱困住。一个 {@spell detect magic} 法术或类似效果揭示了门闩上的唤灵光环。如果任何未戴着印有德兰企业符号的圆形金属别针的人打开了闩，陷阱就会触发。房间内的每个生物必须进行 DC 15 敏捷豁免检定，未通过则受到 16 ({@dice 3d10}) 冷伤害，通过则只受一半伤害。每个陷阱可以通过成功的 DC 13 智力检定 {@skill Arcana} 或使用盗贼工具的敏捷检定来解除。",
	"The stones are coded markers indicating which doors lead to specific portals. That coding is changed regularly, with the portals reassigned to different locations and the stones swapped around to help keep their destinations a secret. As such, a portal still functions if its stone is removed, and a stone can be reattached to a door with a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. Placing a stone over a different door makes it harder for the operatives of the Six to know which doors they've already gone through as they make use of the portal network. Swapping one or more stones thus removes one of the party's failure points. If the players don't work out that the stones can be moved, a character infers this with a successful DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check.": "这些石头是编码标记，指示哪些门通往特定传送门。这种编码定期更改，传送门重新分配到不同位置，石头也被交换以帮助保持它们的目的地秘密。因此，即使移除了石头，传送门仍然可以正常运作，而通过成功的 DC 12 智力检定({@skill Arcana})，石头可以重新附在门上。将石头放在另一扇门上会让六人的特工更难知道他们已经通过了哪些门，因为他们利用传送门网络。因此，交换一个或多个石头可以减少团队的失败点之一。如果玩家没有意识到石头可以移动，一个角色可以通过成功的 DC 14 智力检定({@skill Arcana}) 推断出这一点。",
	"As an advanced security measure, the magic of the portal network prevents a creature from gaining access to the headquarters on board {@i The Maverick} without a certain amount of experience traversing the network. As such, the first three portals the characters access will never lead to the headquarters.": "作为一项高级安全措施，传送门网络的魔法阻止生物在没有足够穿越网络经验的情况下进入{@i The Maverick}总部。因此，角色访问的前三个传送门永远不会通往总部。",

	"If the players are particularly clever, they might come up with novel ways to shortcut the search for the headquarters portal. Perhaps they use {@spell detect thoughts} on a Dran Enterprises operative who knows which stone currently marks the headquarters portal. Maybe exceptional roleplaying allows them to talk an operative into using that portal while the characters watch. If this happens, the first time the characters try to use the headquarters portal, they are shunted back into the portal nexus.": "如果玩家特别聪明，他们可能会想出新颖的方法来缩短寻找总部传送门的时间。也许他们利用{@spell detect thoughts}对一个知道哪块石头标记着总部传送门的德兰企业特工进行审讯。也许出色的角色扮演让他们说服一个特工在角色们观察的情况下使用那个传送门。如果发生这种情况，当角色们第一次尝试使用总部传送门时，他们会被弹回传送门枢纽。",
	"Any Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check made to read the portal's magic reveals that the way forward is blocked except to those with experience using the portal network. The characters must pass through three other portals first, but you can say that their attempts to access the headquarters portal have locked it down temporarily, preventing the Six from accessing it. Remove one failure point from the party's total.": "任何情报检定({@skill Arcana})用于阅读传送门的魔法都会显示前方的道路被阻挡，除非是有经验使用传送门网络的人。角色们必须先通过其他三个传送门，但你可以说他们尝试访问总部传送门的行动已经暂时锁定了它，阻止了六人进入。从队伍的总失败点中移除一个。",
	"The mass of writhing tentacles is a Far Realm horror known as a {@creature chaos quadrapod|AI} (see {@book appendix B|AI|5}).

	"As soon as the chaos quadrapod is killed or sent back through the door, the unstable magic of this portal draws the characters back to the portal nexus, giving them no time to explore the ship. However, a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check identifies the strange surroundings and the chaos quadrapod as products of the nightmarish Far Realm.": "一旦混沌四足兽被杀死或被送回门内，这个传送门的不稳定魔法会将角色们吸引回传送门枢纽，不给他们探索飞船的时间。然而，成功通过 DC 12 智力检定 ({@skill Arcana}) 可以识别出这个奇怪的环境和混沌四足兽都是来自梦魇般的遥远位面——法术境界 (Far Realm) 的产物。",

	"If the characters did not befriend Dagdra, they must search the endless maze of crates for the exit portal. This search can reveal the various products noted above (which the characters are free to steal and later resell using the shady business practice activity).

Either way, it remains a powerful artifact, as detailed in {@book appendix D|AI|7}.": "天文钟的最终状态取决于仪式期间发生了什么。如果在角色和Splugoth争夺组件的过程中发生了大量意外事件，天文钟可能会发展出更多随机属性，或者可能会失去一些更强大的力量。无论哪种情况，它仍然是一件强大的神器，详细信息请参见{@book appendix D|AI|7}。",
	"If the adventurers ask Jerr to be a guide, he happily takes the job for 1 gp. He then leads the characters straight into an ambush by a gang working for the Zhentarim (see the \"Skeleton Crew\" encounter below). A successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check is needed to see through the skilled lies of the gnome.": "如果冒险者请杰尔(Jerr)充当向导，他会高兴地接受1 gp的工作报酬。然后他会带领角色们直接走进了一个由效忠于黑网络(Zhentarim)的团伙设下的伏击（参见下文的“骷髅船员”遭遇）。需要成功通过DC 15的感知({@skill Insight})检定来看穿这位侏儒熟练的谎言。",
	"{@creature Jelayne|OoW} isn't aware that she's undead. Even though the last of her flesh is constantly sloughing off her, she dismisses that effect as \"allergies.\" The rest of the crew don't know what to do, since {@creature Jelayne|OoW} has kept her intellect, knowledge, and personality. They have always followed her and done fine for themselves, so why let death interfere with a good thing?": "{@creature Jelayne|OoW}并不知道自己是不死生物。尽管她身上最后的血肉不断脱落，她却把这个效应解释为“过敏”。船员们不知道该怎么办，因为{@creature Jelayne|OoW}保留了她的智慧、知识和个性。他们一直跟随她，为自己做得不错，所以为什么要让死亡干扰这一切呢？",
	"This pit trap triggers when weight is put on it. Locating the trap requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) or Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, but the check is made with disadvantage unless the creature making it is within 5 feet of the trap. When the pit opens, the triggering creature drops into a 10-foot-deep pit and takes 3 ({@dice 1d6}) bludgeoning damage. The lid remains open, and the pit begins filling with water flowing up from grates in the floor—along with small, glowing blue fish. These are harmless glowing cave fish, but it takes a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) or Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check to recognize that. The fish immediately start to bite any exposed skin of a creature in the water, but the result is only healthful exfoliation.": "这个坑陷阱会在有重量加在上面时触发。要找到陷阱，需要进行一次成功的 DC 20 智力（{@skill Investigation}）或感知（{@skill Perception}）检定，但除非进行检定的生物在距离陷阱5英尺内，否则检定会受到劣势。当坑洞打开时，触发的生物会掉入一个10英尺深的坑中，并受到3点（{@dice 1d6}）的钝击伤害。盖子保持打开状态，坑开始充满从地板上的格栅中流出的水，还有一些发光的小蓝鱼。这些是无害的发光洞穴鱼，但要认出这一点需要进行一次成功的 DC 12 智力（{@skill Nature}）或感知（{@skill Survival}）检定。这些鱼会立即开始咬水中生物的任何暴露的皮肤，但结果只是有益的去角质作用。",
	"The {@creature carrion crawler} waits in the next area, resting after taking a beating from Caerhan. The creature has only 20 hit points remaining, but it's hungry and angry. It attacks if any character enters the next cavern, and pursues characters who flee in any direction.": "{@creature carrion crawler} 在下一个区域等待，经过与凯尔汉激烈战斗后正在休息。这个生物只剩下20点生命值，但它又饥饿又愤怒。如果有任何角色进入下一个洞穴，它会发动攻击，并追击试图逃跑的角色。",
	"A character who touches the altar willingly must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be {@condition charmed} by a spirit loyal to That-Which-Endures. While {@condition charmed} in this way, the character must use its action each turn to attack any creature defiling the shrine. This effect lasts for as long as the affected creature remains in this area, but the compulsion also prevents the creature from leaving the shrine.": "一个角色若自愿触碰祭坛，必须成功通过 DC 12 的魅力豁免才能抵抗那位永恒之物忠诚的灵魂。被 {@condition charmed} 的角色必须每个回合使用动作攻击亵渎神龛的任何生物。这种效应持续直到受影响的生物离开这个区域，但这种强迫也阻止了生物离开神龛。",
	"Any character who succeeds on the above check or on a DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to study the destruction here determines that a powerful pulse of magical power centered in this area is likely what caused the earthquake. The character also intuits that with the shrine's destructive magic curtailed by the earthquake, it is no longer a threat.": "任何成功通过上述检查或在一次DC 12智力检定中{@skill Investigation}的角色，都会确定这里发生的强大魔法能量脉冲很可能是导致地震的原因。角色还直觉到，由于地震削弱了神龛的破坏性魔法，它不再构成威胁。",
	"As the characters draw closer, a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Investigation}) check reveals that the fire damage isn't natural, and that magic was likely involved. The same successful check allows a character to intuit that the stonework was not smashed by weapons or tools, suggesting that a creature of great size and strength took part in the destruction.": "当角色们走近时，成功通过一次DC 15的智力检定（{@skill Arcana}或{@skill Investigation}）会揭示火焰伤害并非自然产生，很可能涉及到魔法。同样的成功检定让角色直觉到这些石制品并非被武器或工具打碎，暗示着一只巨大而强壮的生物参与了破坏。",
	"Agents of the Six braced three {@item Alchemist's Fire (flask)|PHB|flasks of alchemist's fire} loosely behind the crates. Any character who searches the crates must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to spot the rigged flasks before moving the crates or otherwise disturbing them. If a character moves any crates before spotting the trap, the three flasks tumble in different directions, exploding in a way that covers the entire room. Each creature in the room takes 2 ({@dice 1d4}) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.": "六之代理人们站在箱子后面，三个{@item Alchemist's Fire (flask)|PHB|flasks of alchemist's fire}松散地排列着。任何搜索箱子的角色必须在移动箱子或者其他干扰之前通过一次DC 12的智力检定({@skill Perception})来发现陷阱瓶。如果角色在发现陷阱之前移动了任何箱子，这三个瓶子会朝不同方向倾斜，爆炸并覆盖整个房间。房间内的每个生物在其回合开始时会受到2({@dice 1d4})火焰伤害。生物可以通过使用动作进行一次DC 10的敏捷检定来熄灭火焰来结束这种伤害。",
	"The smaller coffin is a {@creature mimic} left to guard this area by agents of the Six. In its current form, this monster is indistinguishable from an object, so it surprises any group that has no means to detect it before it attacks.": "这个小棺材是由六人组织的特工留下来守护这个区域的{@creature mimic}。在目前的形态下，这个怪物和一个物体没什么区别，所以会在袭击前让没有探测手段的团队感到惊讶。",
	"One of the larger coffins has a pouch sewn into the lining under an embroidered star, which a character can find with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. The pouch detaches from the lining with any sharp tug. Inside is a {@item potion of gaseous form} and a {@item potion of frost giant strength}, kept as a means of escape for someone accidentally entombed alive.": "其中一个较大的棺材在绣有星星的衬里下缝有一个袋子，角色可以通过成功的DC 15感知（{@skill Perception}）检定找到。只要用力一拉，袋子就会从衬里上脱落。里面有一个{@item potion of gaseous form}和一个{@item potion of frost giant strength}，作为一个意外被活埋的人的逃生手段。",
	"Each hobgoblin has 25 gp and a {@i potion of healing}.

	"Rainbow's glass terrarium is full of dirt, plants, insects, and webs. It also contains the {@item rotor of return|AI}, buried beneath the dirt in the tank. Rainbow knows the rotor is there but reveals its presence only if Wizzy is dead and the characters haven't found the object on their own. A character who searches the tank and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) or Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check finds the rotor. If it is taken before Wizzy is confirmed dead, Rainbow is sullen but makes no argument.": "彩虹的玻璃园景箱里充满了泥土、植物、昆虫和蜘蛛网。它还包含着{@item rotor of return|AI}，埋藏在箱子里的泥土下面。彩虹知道转子在那里，但只有在Wizzy死亡且角色们没有自己找到物品时才会透露其存在。一个搜索箱子并在DC 15的智力检定({@skill Investigation})或感知检定({@skill Perception})中成功的角色会找到这个转子。如果在Wizzy被确认死亡之前拿走了它，彩虹会闷闷不乐但不会提出异议。",
	"The device has an easily spotted 6-inch-wide slot on its back, with the edge of a round disk protruding from it. A character within 5 feet of the buzz saw who succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check can pull out a charged disk from the slot, causing the buzz saw to power down. This charged disk is identical to the disks that power the replica modrons.": "该装置在背部有一个宽6英寸的明显的槽，槽口有一个圆盘的边缘突出。在距离旋转锯不到5英尺的角色，如果成功通过DC 10的敏捷检定({@skill Sleight of Hand})，可以从槽中取出一个充电的圆盘，导致旋转锯停止运转。这个充电的圆盘与给复制模德龙供能的圆盘完全相同。",
	"The {@creature mechachimera|OoW} falls apart when destroyed, revealing five large platinum rods worth 100 gp each, as well as its three charged disks. In addition, characters poking through the construct's remains can spot two magic items that were part of its components—a {@item sentinel shield} and a {@item Quaal's Feather Token, Anchor||Quaal's feather token (anchor)}.": "当被摧毁时，{@creature mechachimera|OoW}会分解开，露出五根价值100 gp每根的大型铂金棒，以及它的三个充能圆盘。此外，翻找这个构造物残骸的角色可以发现两件魔法物品，它们曾是构造物的组成部分——一个{@item sentinel shield}和一个{@item Quaal's Feather Token, Anchor||Quaal's feather token (anchor)}。",
	"This humorously small ship is watched over by four {@creature Guard||guards} that stand a silent vigil around the cabin.

	"Despite how strong the doors and magic of the vaults are, the walls between adjacent vaults are relatively thin. Dealing 40 bludgeoning or force damage to an inner wall creates a hole wide enough for a character to enter another vault. (What kind of attention doing so attracts is left to your determination.) Other means of entering might be possible, including some of the scrolls carried by {@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW} the tabaxi (see \"{@area 11:30 AM|237|x}\").": "尽管保险库的门和魔法很坚固，但相邻保险库之间的墙壁相对较薄。对内墙造成40点钝击或力场伤害会创造一个足够宽的洞，让角色可以进入另一个保险库。（这样做会引起怎样的注意取决于你的决定。）还有其他可能的进入方式，包括一些由猫人{@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW} {@area 11:30 AM|237|x}携带的卷轴。",
	"Sticking out like a sore thumb is a lone merchant at the end of one of the long tables. {@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW} (N female tabaxi) wears a bandolier of magic wands and watches over a number of small chests beneath her table. She passes herself off as an accomplished mage and merchant, though she's actually a career rogue—and a member of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. After looting the treasury of a religious order she was formerly affiliated with, {@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW} has come to Horn Enclave to deposit her ill-gained goods and lay low for a while. Whether her franchise is known to the characters (and whether her recent theft was done for the franchise or as a solo job) is left up to you. Naturally, {@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW} has made sure that the dwarves of Clan Horn know nothing of her company affiliations.": "在一张长桌的尽头，一个像是一只鲜明的拇指般显眼的商人。{@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW}（女性塔伯西）身上挂满了魔杖的弹带，她看守着桌子下面的一些小箱子。她自称是一名有成就的法师和商人，实际上是一名职业盗贼，也是《收购公司》分部的成员。在掠夺了她曾经隶属的一个宗教团体的金库之后，{@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW}来到角角落，准备存放她非法获得的货物，并低调一段时间。角色们是否知道她所属的分部（以及她最近的盗窃是为分部还是个人行为）由你决定。当然，{@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW}已经确保角角落的矮人们对她的公司关系一无所知。",
	"{@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW} is a wild card, placed in the adventure to help the characters gain information. She can share details about the vaults in general, where vault records are stored, and the like. {@skill Intimidation} and trickery work on her well enough, but a friendly attitude wins her over to the characters more strongly. If the characters stay on her good side, she might become a valuable ally and resource.": "{@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW}是一个通配符，在冒险中被放置在那里，帮助角色获得信息。她可以分享有关金库的一般细节，金库记录存放的地方等等。{@skill Intimidation}和欺骗对她有效，但友好的态度会更有效地赢得她对角色的好感。如果角色保持与她的良好关系，她可能会成为一个宝贵的盟友和资源。",

	"The three people at the table nearest the door include Luna and Thalen (CG female and male human {@creature Commoner||commoners}), the adolescent servants of a wandering wizard named Thed. They were sent to the Dran & Courtier to reserve a room for their master, and though they keep trying to leave, the outside door doesn't open for them. Bored, they have begun to make notes of everything around them. They have noticed that the mice appear very intelligent, ably eluding the inn's resident cat, {@creature Onyx|OoW}. The dark cat can be seen roaming the area periodically, and keeps an eye on a mouse hole near the fireplace. Luna and Thalen would make excellent wizard hirelings for the franchise if the characters were inclined to train them.": "靠近门口的桌子上坐着三个人，包括Luna和Thalen（{@creature Commoner||commoners}中的CG女性和男性人类），他们是流浪巫师Thed的青少年仆人。他们被派去Dran & Courtier为他们的主人预订房间，尽管他们不断尝试离开，但外面的门对他们不起作用。无聊的时候，他们开始记录周围的一切。他们注意到老鼠似乎非常聪明，能够巧妙地躲避客栈里的猫（{@creature Onyx|OoW}）。这只黑猫定期出现在周围，并盯着壁炉附近的一个老鼠洞。如果角色们有意愿培训他们，Luna和Thalen将成为加盟店的出色巫师雇佣兵。",
