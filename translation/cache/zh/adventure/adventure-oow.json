	"This chapter presents a complete Acquisitions Incorporated adventure divided into six episodes. Episode 1 is for players using shiny new 1st-level characters. They're ready to take on the world and hoping to become part-owners of a share in a valuable, prestigious Acquisitions Incorporated franchise—or at least gain a coveted internship with the organization.": "本章介绍了一个完整的收购公司冒险，分为六集。第1集是为使用闪亮的新一级角色的玩家准备的。他们已经准备好向世界挑战，并希望成为有价值、有声望的收购公司特许经营权的部分拥有者--或者至少获得一个令人羡慕的组织实习机会。",
	"At the end of each episode, characters gain a level. Each episode is an appropriate challenge for a party of four characters of the indicated level, but that challenge can be modified to accommodate your group. At the end of the sixth and final episode, the characters attain 7th level. But even more importantly, they will be fully vested in an operational and maybe even profitable Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. After that, the players and characters can take their treasure-hunting activities in any direction that you and they desire.": "在每一集结束时，角色会获得一个等级。每一集都是对指定级别的四名角色的适当挑战，但该挑战可以修改以适应你的团体。在第六集也就是最后一集结束时，人物达到了第七级。但更重要的是，他们将完全拥有一个可运营的、甚至可能盈利的收购公司特许经营权。在那之后，玩家和角色可以按照你和他们的意愿，在任何方向上进行寻宝活动。",
	"Between episodes, characters will use downtime to undertake a variety of activities to better themselves or their franchise. By later episodes, choices of downtime activities might alter the flow and challenge of the story. After all, there's no rest for the wicked, so there shouldn't be rest for heroes either. (Logically then, wicked heroes would need to work twice as hard. Budget the time.) Familiarize yourself with the new activities presented in \"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime}\" in chapter 2 of this book, and with the standard D&D downtime activities discussed in that section.": "在两集之间，人物会利用停工期进行各种活动，以改善自己或其特许经营权。到后来的剧情中，对停工期活动的选择可能会改变故事的流程和挑战。毕竟，恶人是没有休息的，所以英雄也不应该有休息。(从逻辑上讲，邪恶的英雄需要加倍努力工作。编制时间预算）。熟悉本书第二章\"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime} \"中介绍的新活动，以及该节中讨论的标准D&D停工活动。",
	"The {@book Monster Manual|MM} contains stat blocks for most of the creatures found in this adventure. All the necessary stat blocks are included there or in {@book appendix B|AI|4}. When a creature's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue for you to look up the creature's stat block in the {@book Monster Manual|MM} or the monster appendix in this book.": "{@book Monster Manual|MM}包含了本冒险中发现的大多数生物的状态块。所有必要的状态块都包括在这里或{@book appendix B|AI|4}中。当一个生物的名字以{@b bold}的形式出现时，那是一个视觉提示，让你在{@book Monster Manual|MM}或本书的怪物附录中查找该生物的状态块。",
	"This part of the book is for the DM only. If you're planning to run through the adventure as a player, stop reading now! Unless you want to keep going, that is. Because seriously, it's not like anyone's going to stop you. After all, information is power—in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, and in life. Maybe you having a bit of an inside track is just what this adventure needs to make it really pop, and to keep the DM from getting all, \"Ooh, look at me! I'm the one with the secrets!\" I mean, can you believe how smug they are? It's like they're just begging you to turn the page...": "本书的这一部分只为管理员准备。如果你打算以玩家的身份进行冒险，现在就停止阅读吧！除非你想继续下去。除非你想继续下去，那就是。因为说真的，没有人会阻止你。毕竟，信息就是力量--在收购公司的活动中，以及在生活中。也许你有一点内幕消息正是这个冒险所需要的，以使它真正流行起来，并使DM不至于 \"哦，看我的！\"。我才是有秘密的人！\" 我的意思是，你能相信他们是多么自以为是吗？这就像他们只是在乞求你翻开这一页......",
	"The grand buffet that is an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign features plenty of the exciting locations and high adventure common to all great fantasy campaigns. But an Acq Inc game adds a unique helping of humor and corporate intrigue to the mix, creating a rich narrative familiar to anyone who's watched an Acquisitions Incorporated livestream game. To take full advantage of the potential of an Acq Inc campaign, keep the following concepts in mind.": "盛大的自助餐是收购公司的活动，其中有很多令人兴奋的地点和所有伟大的幻想活动中常见的高度冒险。但是，Acq公司的游戏在混合中加入了独特的幽默和企业阴谋，创造了丰富的叙事，这对任何观看过Acquisition Incorporated直播游戏的人来说都很熟悉。为了充分利用Acq公司活动的潜力，请牢记以下概念。",
	"This campaign provides many NPCs for you to do with as you please. They all have roles to play in the encounters and events of the adventure, but what happens to them after that is up to you. Every NPC could be a potential ally, enemy, or foil later in the campaign. If the players take a shine to one, bring that character back—or better yet, make the NPC an integral part of the ongoing plot. All franchises need servants and hirelings to do mundane jobs, and NPCs the characters already know are a great fit for these roles. Employ these NPCs to make the world feel more familiar and real to the players and characters alike.": "这个活动为你提供了许多NPC，你可以随意处置。他们在冒险的遭遇和事件中都有作用，但之后发生在他们身上的事情就取决于你了。每个NPC都可以成为潜在的盟友、敌人，或者在以后的活动中成为陪衬。如果玩家对某个角色感兴趣，就把这个角色带回来，或者更好的是，让这个NPC成为正在进行的情节的一个组成部分。所有的特许经营都需要仆人和雇工来做平凡的工作，而人物已经认识的NPC是这些角色的最佳人选。使用这些NPC，使玩家和角色对这个世界感到更加熟悉和真实。",
	"Even the most heroic heroes sometimes fall short. And in many cases, adventurers aren't even within longbow range of \"virtuous\" in their motivations. As such, what the characters fail to do, do poorly, or do wrongly can be just as important as what they accomplish. Don't let failure and setbacks derail an adventure or a campaign. Rather, look for ways that failure or partial success might lead to new ways to reach a campaign goal.": "即使是最英勇的英雄有时也会落空。而且在许多情况下，冒险家的动机甚至不在长弓的 \"美德 \"范围内。因此，角色的失败、做得不好或做得不对可能与他们的成就一样重要。不要让失败和挫折使冒险或活动脱轨。相反，要寻找失败或部分成功可能导致实现活动目标的新方法。",
	"You might be absolutely confident that the characters will save those townsfolk and earn their trust, letting you use the townsfolk to reveal an important quest goal. But if the town burns down despite the heroes' best intentions—or because they had better things to do—let them be mistaken for local authorities come to lend a hand in the aftermath. Or let them be unexpectedly arrested after being mistaken for the evil forces that burned the town down, and given the dangerous quest out of animosity. Humor plays a big part in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, so make use of unheroic irony whenever the players and characters provide it.": "你可能绝对相信人物会拯救那些乡民，并赢得他们的信任，让你利用乡民来揭示一个重要的任务目标。但是如果镇子被烧毁了，尽管英雄们的意图是好的，或者是因为他们有更好的事情要做，那么就让他们被误认为是当地政府来帮忙善后的。或者让他们在被误认为是烧毁小镇的邪恶势力后被意外逮捕，并因敌意而获得危险的任务。幽默在收购公司的活动中起着很大的作用，所以只要玩家和角色提供了非英雄式的讽刺，就可以利用它。",
	"Wow. Can you believe the advice your players are getting in that sidebar on the last page? And after all the time you're going to put in getting ready to run this adventure? Outrageous! Someone needs to teach these people a lesson.": "哇。你能相信你的玩家在最后一页的侧边栏中得到的建议吗？在你花了那么多时间准备进行这次冒险之后？太离谱了! 有人需要给这些人上一课。",
	"If you're running the adventure for larger or smaller groups, you can adjust the encounters using the guidelines given in chapter 3, \"{@book Creating Adventures|DMG|-1},\" in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. Or maybe you'll adjust them anyway to keep things interesting. And never forget that you can change up any aspects of the adventure to make them a better fit for your campaign. Swap monsters around to keep the players guessing, or make use of the adventure's many suggestions for side treks and additional encounters. That'll keep these so-called heroes in line.": "如果你为较大或较小的团体进行冒险，你可以使用第三章\"{@book Creating Adventures|DMG|-1} \"中给出的准则来调整遭遇战。也可能你会调整它们，以保持事情的趣味性。永远不要忘记，你可以改变冒险的任何方面，使它们更适合你的活动。把怪物换来换去，让玩家猜来猜去，或者利用冒险中的许多建议来进行旁门左道和额外的遭遇战。这将使这些所谓的英雄们保持一致。",
	"By its most basic nature, a roleplaying game campaign focuses on the actions of the characters. However, it's important to remember that the world goes on without them. The heroes can't be everywhere at once. If they establish a base in one town but spend a lot of time away, anything could happen to that base. Hirelings might grow disenchanted in the characters' service if abused, neglected, or left to their own devices for too long. Ramp up the drama and the humor of a campaign by occasionally focusing on what the characters neglected or left behind.": "就其最基本的性质而言，角色扮演游戏活动的重点是人物的行动。然而，重要的是要记住，没有他们，世界也在继续。英雄们不可能同时出现在任何地方。如果他们在一个城镇建立了一个基地，但却花了很多时间在外面，那么这个基地就可能发生任何事情。如果被虐待、被忽视或被放任自流太久，雇佣者可能会对人物的服务感到失望。通过偶尔关注人物被忽视或遗弃的东西来增加活动的戏剧性和幽默感。",
	"An Acquisitions Incorporated franchise is like a newborn baby that the characters all had a hand in conceiving, delivering, and raising. It needs constant care and feeding as it grows to its full potential, but there'll be a lot of risks, drama, and dirty diapers along the way. (Okay, that might be taking the analogy too far, but you get the idea.) Running a franchise can be difficult, but the potential rewards for the characters are tremendous. And for the players, making the franchise the focal point of the campaign provides a joint goal and a shared vessel of creative input.": "收购公司的特许经营权就像一个新生的婴儿，所有角色都参与了孕育、分娩和抚养。它需要不断的照顾和喂养，以充分发挥其潜力，但在这一过程中会有很多风险、戏剧和脏尿布。(好吧，这个比喻可能太远了，但你明白这个意思。)经营一个特许经营权可能是困难的，但对角色的潜在回报是巨大的。而对于玩家来说，将特许经营权作为活动的焦点，提供了一个共同的目标和一个共同的创造性投入的容器。",
	"This adventure touches on a number of classic tropes in its setup and execution. Artifact of incalculable power accidentally stumbled upon? Check. Evil faction with plans to end the world? Got it. But even against potentially world-shattering events and plots, an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign is always centered around humble characters making choices—including one unfortunate NPC whose choices have set the adventure in motion.": "这场冒险在其设置和执行过程中触及了许多经典套路。意外发现了具有不可估量的力量的神器？没错。计划结束世界的邪恶派别？是的。但是，即使是面对可能震惊世界的事件和阴谋，收购公司的活动总是围绕着卑微的角色做出选择--包括一个不幸的NPC，他的选择使冒险开始了。",
	"A year ago, a group of adventurers led by a dwarf named Caerhan Coalsmith found a strange object buried in the remains of a ruined tower. The relic appeared to be a golden orrery housing, missing its geared clockwork components. It was obviously a magic item of some kind, but arcane lore wasn't the party's strong suit, so the orrery was set aside while Caerhan investigated its provenance and history.": "一年前，由一个名叫Caerhan Coalsmith的矮人带领的一群冒险家发现了一个埋在废塔遗迹中的奇怪物体。这个遗物似乎是一个金色的口轮外壳，缺少了齿轮式的发条部件。这显然是某种魔法物品，但奥术理论并不是这个团队的强项，所以在卡伊尔汗调查它的来源和历史时，这个口簧被放在一边。",
	"The dwarf heard a few tales about devices that matched the relic's description. Though he never learned the full scope of its powers, rumors told of how those powers would increase if a magic orrery's missing components were collected and placed within it. Unfortunately, Caerhan also never learned about the curse the orrery carried—and his party paid the price.": "矮人听说过一些关于符合遗物描述的设备的故事。虽然他从未了解过它的全部力量，但有传言说，如果收集到一个魔法饰品的缺失部件并将其放入其中，这些力量就会增强。不幸的是，凯尔汉也从来没有了解过魔戒所携带的诅咒--他的队伍付出了代价。",
	"As an artifact, the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} comes with a random major detrimental property (see the \"{@book Artifacts|DMG|7|Artifacts}\" section in chapter 7 of the {@i {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG})}. The specifics of that property when the orrery housing was found are left up to you, but whatever it was (compulsion to evil for someone in the party, hostile life force, imprisoned death slaad, yadda yadda), Caerhan returned from a research trip to Candlekeep to find his fellow party members all dead.": "作为一件神器，{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}附带一个随机的主要有害属性（见{@i {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}第七章中的\"{@book Artifacts|DMG|7|Artifacts} \"部分）}。发现兽皮屋时，该属性的具体情况由你决定，但无论它是什么（对党内某人的强迫性邪恶，敌对的生命力，被囚禁的死亡之士，哒哒哒），Caerhan从Candlekeep的研究之旅回来时，发现他的党员同伴都死了。",
	"Recognizing too late that the orrery housing channeled dark power, the grieving Caerhan decided that the relic must be destroyed. However, its artifact-level magic made it seemingly impervious to harm. More research was undertaken with the help of Caerhan's goblin sidekick, Gorkoh. In the end, Caerhan concluded that the best place to ensure the orrery's end was a secret shrine to destruction beneath Waterdeep, rumored to be able to destroy even powerful magic relics. So the pair packed up and headed for the City of Splendors.": "悲痛欲绝的卡恩决定必须毁掉这个遗物，但他认识到这是黑暗力量的源泉，为时已晚。然而，它的神器级魔法使它似乎不受伤害。在Caerhan的妖精伙伴Gorkoh的帮助下，进行了更多的研究。最后，凯尔汉得出结论，确保神器终结的最佳地点是沃特迪普地下的一个秘密的毁灭神殿，据传它甚至能摧毁强大的魔法遗迹。于是两人收拾行装，前往辉煌之城。",
	"The veteran dwarf adventurer located the underground tunnels leading to the shrine easily enough. He and Gorkoh braved those dangerous passages, but were separated during an encounter with a carrion crawler. Caerhan pressed on. But when he activated the shrine, he caused a minor earthquake that opened a sinkhole in Waterdeep's Dock Ward, and which cracked walls and sidewalks across the city. In the end, the orrery housing was too strong even for the destructive power of the shrine, and Caerhan died during his heroic attempt to rid the world of the dangerous device. Now, the orrery waits for someone else to take possession of it.": "这位资深的矮人冒险家很容易就找到了通往神殿的地下通道。他和Gorkoh勇敢地走过这些危险的通道，但在遇到腐肉爬行者时被分开了。Caerhan继续前进。但当他启动神殿时，他引起了一场小地震，在沃特迪普的码头区打开了一个天坑，并使整个城市的墙壁和人行道开裂。最后，即使对于神龛的破坏力来说，箭塔的外壳也太强大了，卡伊尔汗在他为世界摆脱危险装置的英勇尝试中死去。现在，这个神器正等待着别人来拥有它。",
	"As the characters will learn in time, the orrery and its components were intentionally scattered long ago. But the pieces of the orrery maintain a connection, and have been steadily making their way toward each other for years. With one piece permanently held by the orrery's creator in the Greypeak Mountains, the other components and the orrery housing have ended up scattered across the Sword Coast, falling into the hands of different adventuring groups. One of those groups is the evil faction known as the Six, whose members have become aware of the orrery's existence—and have a full understanding of its potential for destructive power. That power is described in the orrery write-up in {@book appendix D|AI|6}.": "正如主人公将及时了解到的那样，这个金字塔和它的组成部分在很久以前就被有意地分散了。但是金字塔的碎片保持着一种联系，多年来一直在稳定地走向彼此。其中一块由位于格雷皮亚克山脉的神器创造者永久持有，其他部件和神器外壳最终散落在整个剑海岸，落入不同的冒险团体手中。其中一个团体是被称为 \"六人帮 \"的邪恶派别，他们的成员已经意识到了箭塔的存在--并且完全了解其潜在的破坏性力量。这股力量在{@book appendix D|AI|6}中的口诀中有所描述。",
	"As the characters are drawn into contact with the orrery, they discover that two of the artifact's components have been claimed by Acquisitions Incorporated franchises that have come under recent attack by unknown foes. The rival faction of Dran Enterprises becomes a prime suspect, with its agents found on the scene for both attacks. And all the while, the shadowy members of the Six pull together a tangled plot to gain control of the orrery to destroy Acquisitions Incorporated—and bring ruin to Faerûn.": "当这些人物被吸引去接触神器时，他们发现神器的两个部件已经被收购公司的特许经营权认领，而这些特许经营权最近遭到了未知敌人的攻击。德兰企业的敌对派别成为主要嫌疑人，它的代理人被发现在两次袭击的现场。与此同时，\"六人帮 \"的阴暗成员还策划了一个纠缠不清的阴谋，以获得对神器的控制权，从而摧毁收购公司--为法鲁恩带来毁灭。",
	"As the adventure unfolds, the characters travel hither and yon across the Sword Coast and the North, checking in on some classic adventure locations and exploring a number of brand-new sites. Map 1.1 shows the sites and locations featured in \"The Orrery of the Wanderer.\"": "随着冒险的展开，角色们在剑海岸和北方的各个地方旅行，查看一些经典的冒险地点，并探索一些全新的地点。地图1.1显示了 \"流浪者的奥瑞尔 \"中的景点和地点。",
	"In episode 1 of the adventure, a case of mistaken identity gives the characters a rare opportunity to make a name for themselves in Acquisitions Incorporated. Their assigned task is to investigate a sinkhole fissure that opened up in Waterdeep after a small earthquake struck the city—the side effect of Caerhan Coalsmith's failed attempt to destroy the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}. If the characters can conclude the investigation successfully, Acquisitions Incorporated CEO Omin Dran presents them with a unique chance to rise within the ranks of the organization.": "在冒险的第一集里，一个错误的身份给了人物一个难得的机会，让他们在收购公司里扬名立万。他们的任务是调查沃特迪普市在发生小地震后出现的天坑裂缝--这是卡恩-库尔斯密斯摧毁{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}的尝试失败后的副作用。如果角色们能成功完成调查，收购公司的首席执行官Omin Dran会给他们提供一个独特的机会，让他们在组织中晋升。",
	"Before diving headlong into the events of \"The Orrery of the Wanderer\" campaign, you might wish to spend some time having the characters experience and explore the city of Waterdeep. The adventure {@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH} and the \"Volo's Waterdeep Enchiridion\" section of that book (available at the DMs Guild as a separate download—{@link www.dmsguild.com|http://www.dmsguild.com}) provide a ton of information about the City of Splendors.": "在一头扎进 \"流浪者的修道院 \"活动之前，你可能希望花一些时间让角色体验和探索沃特德普城。这个冒险{@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH}和该书中的 \"沃特德普百科全书 \"部分（可在DMs公会单独下载-{@link www.dmsguild.com|http://www.dmsguild.com}）提供了大量关于辉煌之城的信息。",
	"Additionally, you can make use of the following rumors that characters might hear on the streets or in the taverns of that great metropolis. Some of these rumors tie to the adventure, while the truth of others depends on your wishes for the campaign. Either way, feel free to use these rumors as inspiration for new encounters or side treks.": "此外，你还可以利用以下传言，这些传言是人物在那个大都市的街头或酒馆里可能听到的。其中一些谣言与冒险有关，而其他谣言的真相则取决于你对活动的愿望。无论怎样，请自由使用这些传言作为新的遭遇或侧重点的灵感。",
	"Omin Dran is one of the fabled Masked Lords of Waterdeep. His presence on the council is the impetus for beneficial changes sweeping across the city.": "奥明-德兰是传说中的水底世界蒙面领主之一。他在议会中的存在是席卷整个城市的有益变化的推动力。",
	"Omin Dran is definitely not one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep. The addition to the council of such a power-hungry and ruthless individual would spell the end of the rule of law in the City of Splendors.": "奥明-德兰绝对不是水底城的假面领主之一。这样一个渴望权力、冷酷无情的人加入议会，将意味着辉煌之城的法治的终结。",
	"The earthquake that hit the city two days ago wasn't natural. Strong magic unleashed underground caused it—maybe even magic from Undermountain.": "两天前袭击城市的地震并不是自然的。地下释放的强大魔法造成了它--甚至可能是来自地下山的魔法。",
	"Acquisitions Incorporated is making a play for control in the city, and the other power groups of Waterdeep are not going to let that happen without a fight. The recent hostilities between groups such as the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim have been made even worse by the increasing sway of the company.": "收购公司正在争夺城市的控制权，而沃特迪普的其他势力团体也不会让这种情况不经意间发生。最近Xanathar公会和Zhentarim等团体之间的敌对行动，由于该公司的影响力越来越大而变得更加严重。",
	"A noble merchant in the South Ward survived an assassination attempt last night. A female half-elf was seen fleeing the scene, bearing a deep cut on her shoulder from a bodyguard's blade. A 50 gp bounty has been offered for bringing her in alive for questioning.": "昨晚，南区的一位贵族商人在一次暗杀行动中幸存下来。有人看到一名女性半精灵逃离了现场，她的肩膀上有一道被保镖的刀子划破的伤口。有人悬赏50金币，希望能活捉她进行审问。",
	"A killer is stalking the streets of the North Ward, murdering people in broad daylight. The victims' feet are chopped off, as if by a powerful blow with a sharp blade. Then they're decapitated. The heads are left behind, but the feet are taken!": "一个杀手在北区的街道上徘徊，在光天化日之下谋杀人们。受害者的脚被砍掉，就像被一把锋利的刀子强力打击一样。然后他们被斩首。头部被留下，但脚却被带走了!",
	"The famous Waterdavian actor Tystanya Creed has not been seen since leaving the theatre after her last performance several days ago. Her adoring fans fear she is dead.": "著名的Waterdavian演员Tystanya Creed在几天前最后一次演出后离开剧院后就再也没有出现过。她的崇拜者担心她已经死了。",
	"Towering forms in black cloaks have been seen around the City of the Dead at night. A number of witnesses swear that those cloaks and their deep hoods concealed skeletal forms.": "夜晚，人们在死亡之城周围看到穿着黑色斗篷的高大身影。一些目击者发誓，这些斗篷和它们的深色罩子掩盖了骷髅的形状。",
	"A green dragon was spotted flying over the Sea of Swords just west of the city. The Blackstaff and her team are on high alert in case it ventures closer or harasses ships in the area.": "一条绿龙被发现在城市西部的剑海上空飞行。黑杖和她的团队正处于高度警惕状态，以防它冒险靠近或骚扰该地区的船只。",
	"One of the great walking statues of Waterdeep has been reported to be crying over the last three days. No one is sure about the cause of this watery discharge from the eyes, but some say it means the destruction of the City of Splendors is imminent! Others are certain it's a sign of great fortune on the horizon. Still others say it's just the humidity.": "据报道，在过去的三天里，沃特德普的一个伟大的步行雕像一直在哭泣。没有人确定这种眼睛流泪的原因，但有人说这意味着辉煌之城的毁灭迫在眉睫! 另一些人则肯定这是一个伟大的财富即将到来的标志。还有人说这只是湿度问题。",
	"Members of the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters are going on strike, leaving the streets of Waterdeep dark and dangerous around the next new moon. The thieves and assassins of the city are already getting prepared for a night of carnage.": "Chandlers和Lamplighters公会的成员正在进行罢工，在下一个新月前后，水底世界的街道将变得黑暗而危险。这个城市的盗贼和刺客们已经开始为一夜的屠杀做准备了。",
	"The adventure begins with the characters seeking franchise opportunities or internships at the Waterdeep offices of Acquisitions Incorporated. All the characters should know the popular tales of that well-known organization and might have ties to Acq Inc (especially characters with one of the {@book backgrounds|AI|2|Backgrounds} from {@book chapter 3|AI|2}).": "冒险开始时，人物在收购公司的Waterdeep办公室寻求特许经营机会或实习机会。所有的角色都应该知道那个著名组织的流行故事，并且可能与Acq公司有联系（尤其是与{@book chapter 3|AI|2}的{@book backgrounds|AI|2|Backgrounds}之一的角色）。",
	"Sure, I get it. Your first time meeting Omin Dran can be intimidating. But just remember, under all that armor is a merciless psychopath infused with the power of a god.": "当然，我明白。你第一次见到奥明德兰可能会被吓到。但请记住，在所有的盔甲下是一个被注入神的力量的无情的精神病患者。",
	"For a nervously long length of time, the characters are kept waiting in a conference room at Head Office. Read or paraphrase the following to begin:": "在一段紧张的时间里，这些人物一直在总部的会议室里等待。阅读或转述以下内容，开始。",
	"Your inquiries into internships and franchise opportunities at Acquisitions Incorporated have gone even better than you'd hoped. Ridiculous rumors talk about how prospective interns of Acq Inc aren't always treated with respect, dignity, or care. Even more ridiculous tales of interns dying at an alarming rate are told throughout the city. Thankfully, you don't believe a word of any of that.": "你对收购公司的实习和特许经营机会的询问比你希望的还要顺利。荒谬的传言谈到Acq公司的未来实习生并不总是受到尊重、尊严和关怀。整个城市还流传着关于实习生以惊人的速度死亡的更荒唐的故事。值得庆幸的是，你一个字都不相信。",
	"So far, everyone at Head Office has treated you with kindness, and even a bit of deference. You were shown into this elegant conference room, given fine food and drink, and asked to wait to speak with none other than Omin Dran—founder and CEO of this august organization.": "到目前为止，总部的每个人都对你很客气，甚至有点恭敬。你被带进了这个优雅的会议室，得到了精美的食物和饮料，并被要求等待与这个庄严组织的创始人兼首席执行官奥明-德兰交谈。",
	"If the characters already know each other, they were ushered into the conference room as a group. If they came to Head Office separately, they were each brought in alone and asked to wait with the others, and have a chance to introduce themselves before Omin appears.": "如果这些人物已经互相认识，他们就会被作为一个团体带进会议室。如果他们分别来到总部，他们各自被单独带入，并被要求与其他人一起等待，并在奥明出现之前有机会介绍自己。",
	"It isn't long before the door to the conference room opens, and an intense-looking half-elf in plate armor enters. He wears a holy symbol of Tymora, the goddess of fortune, around his neck. It's Omin Dran! With no introduction, the CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated speaks.": "没过多久，会议室的门打开了，一个身穿板甲、神情紧张的半精灵走了进来。他的脖子上戴着财富女神泰莫拉的神圣标志。这就是奥明-德兰! 不用介绍，收购公司的首席执行官就开口了。",
	"\"Thank you for answering my call so quickly. When the earthquake struck the city two days ago, damage was limited, but a sinkhole opened up a fissure beneath an abandoned warehouse in Dock Ward. Two City Watch guards entered the fissure to investigate, but never came out. They're now feared dead, and the City Watch has asked me to take over the investigation. But my schedule is complicated at the moment, so I'm delegating that job to you. As an experienced adventuring group, I have no doubt that you can handle the task.\"": "\"谢谢你这么快就接了我的电话。两天前地震发生时，损失有限，但一个天坑在码头区一个废弃的仓库下面打开了一个裂缝。两名城市守卫进入裂缝进行调查，但再也没有出来。他们现在恐怕已经死了，而城市守望要求我接手调查。但我现在的日程安排很复杂，所以我把这项工作委托给你。作为一个经验丰富的冒险团，我毫不怀疑你们能处理好这项任务。\"",
	"Before you have any chance to respond, Omin drops a hefty bag of coins onto the table. \"The pay is 500 gold dragons for the group, with a 20 percent commission going to Acquisitions Incorporated as the broker.

	"Then without another word, Omin Dran turns and leaves the room.": "然后没有再说话，奥明德兰转身离开了房间。",
	"Through a crazy and never-to-be-explained misunderstanding, Omin believes that the characters are a group of experienced adventurers that he put out a call for just the day before. If the characters attempt to correct this misunderstanding, he ignores them. The CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated has important business to deal with, and can't be bothered with such trifles.": "通过一个疯狂的、无法解释的误解，Omin认为这些角色是他前一天刚发出的一群有经验的冒险家。如果角色们试图纠正这种误解，他就不理会他们。收购公司的首席执行官有重要的业务要处理，不可能为这些琐事而烦恼。",
	"When visiting Head Office, never approach Omin directly. Use the proper forms and filing procedures. After a brief four-month waiting time, you will be granted a very generous sixty-second meeting. It'll be the best minute of your life.": "在访问总部时，切勿直接接近Omin。使用适当的表格和备案程序。在短暂的四个月等待时间后，你将获得一次非常慷慨的六十秒会面。这将是你生命中最好的一分钟。",
	"With absolutely no idea what they're meant to do or how they got into this position, the characters might try to seek out assistance before they leave Head Office. Or they might just wander around lost for a bit. Either way, Jim Darkmagic approaches the group with some words of... well, let's call it wisdom. When it's time for Jim to make his appearance, read or paraphrase the following:": "由于完全不知道自己要做什么，也不知道自己是怎么走到这一步的，这些人物可能会在离开总部之前试图寻求帮助。或者，他们可能只是迷路了一下。无论哪种情况，吉姆-黑魔王都会用一些......嗯，让我们称之为智慧的话来接近这群人。当吉姆出场的时候，请阅读或解读以下内容。",
	"A puff of smoke erupts out of nowhere. As the haze disperses, a handsome figure steps forward. It's Jim Darkmagic of the New Hampshire Darkmagics! Except he's wearing a set of glasses that he apparently thinks is an effective disguise as he bows before you.": "一股烟雾不知从何处爆发出来。随着烟雾的散去，一个英俊的身影走了出来。那是新罕布什尔州黑暗魔术团的吉姆-黑暗魔术师！他是新罕布什尔州黑暗魔术师。只是他戴着一副眼镜，显然他认为这是一种有效的伪装，因为他在你面前鞠躬。",
	"\"I'm no one you know,\" he says. \"But I couldn't help but notice that you seem a little flustered. I believe Omin just offered you work. And I also have a feeling you might not be the adventurers he thinks you are.\"": "\"我不是你认识的人，\"他说。\"但我忍不住注意到，你似乎有点慌乱。我相信奥明刚刚给你提供了工作。而且我也有一种感觉，你们可能不是他认为的冒险家。\"",
	"Jim looks around to make sure no one else is listening in, then leans forward to deliver a conspiratorial whisper. \"You want my advice? Do the job. If you can pull it off, Omin will be so impressed that you'll have a leg up on everybody else trying to gain footing with the company. You've heard the phrase \"opportunity knocks?\" Well, opportunity is heading right at your door with a battering ram. Stand in that doorway, friends. Let opportunity smash its way in.\"": "吉姆环顾四周，确保没有其他人在偷听，然后俯身向前，发出阴谋论的低语。\"你想要我的建议吗？做好这项工作。如果你能成功，奥明会对你刮目相看，你会比其他想在公司立足的人更有优势。你听说过 \"机会来了 \"这句话吗？那么，机会正带着敲门砖向你走来。朋友们，请站在门口。让机会砸进来。\"",
	"Jim's reasons for interceding with the characters are left to your determination. He might have intercepted the experienced adventurers Omin called for, then sent them off on a secret personal mission on his own behalf. Or he might have accidentally set them on fire when they arrived at Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office. Whatever the case, he needs the players' group to attempt Omin's mission, and he's keen to get them on their way.": "吉姆与这些人物交涉的原因由你决定。他可能拦截了奥明要求的有经验的冒险家，然后以他自己的名义派他们去执行一项秘密的个人任务。或者当他们到达收购公司总部时，他可能不小心放火烧了他们。不管是什么情况，他需要玩家的团队去尝试Omin的任务，而且他很想让他们上路。",
	"If the characters attempt to sort the case of mistaken identity out, Jim tells them Omin is unavailable, and concedes that they don't have to take the job. He points out that the characters are welcome to leave Acq Inc and never come back. But Omin might want to have words with them later about the dastardly way they misrepresented themselves.": "如果角色们试图弄清这个错误的身份，吉姆告诉他们奥明没有空，并承认他们不一定要接受这份工作。他指出，欢迎这些人物离开Acq公司，不再回来。但是奥明可能想在以后和他们谈谈他们错误陈述自己的卑鄙行为。",
	"After finishing up at Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office, the adventurers can set off to perform their appointed mission.": "在收购公司总部结束后，冒险家们可以出发去执行他们指定的任务。",
	"Jim Darkmagic is... uh... How do I put this? He's, uh... hmm. Let me get back to you.": "Jim Darkmagic是...呃...我怎么说呢？他是，呃......嗯。让我给你回话。",
	"Omin's assignment takes the characters to Dock Ward in Waterdeep, a maze of seedy tenements, rough streets, and even rougher alleyways. If the characters have spent time in the city, they might have heard that much of this ward is set up as safe houses, meeting places, and fronts for a variety of criminal organizations, including the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim. None of these groups are particularly happy right now, since the sinkhole caused by the earthquake opened up smack dab in the middle of their territory. The sinkhole also brought the Waterdeep City Watch to the ward, a move welcomed by no one—least of all the members of the Watch, who must now stand guard over the site until it can be investigated and closed.": "Omin的任务是把角色带到Waterdeep的Dock Ward，一个由肮脏的公寓、粗糙的街道和更粗糙的小巷组成的迷宫。如果角色们在这个城市呆过，他们可能听说这个区的大部分地方都被设置成安全屋、聚会场所，以及各种犯罪组织的幌子，包括Xanathar公会和Zhentarim。这些组织现在都不太高兴，因为地震造成的天坑正好开在他们的地盘中间。这个天坑还把沃特迪普城市守卫队带到了病房，此举没有人欢迎，尤其是守卫队的成员，他们现在必须在现场站岗，直到调查和关闭。",
	"A character whose background entails knowledge of the ward knows the general layout of its streets and alleys, but finding Jolly's Lamp Emporium and the abandoned warehouse requires asking for directions at some point. Use the following encounters as a general setup, but you can add additional encounters as the characters make their way through the ward as you see fit.": "一个背景需要了解该区的人物知道其街道和小巷的大致布局，但要找到乔利的灯饰店和废弃的仓库需要在某些时候问路。你可以把下面的遭遇作为一般的设置，但你可以在人物通过病房时增加你认为合适的其他遭遇。",
	"As the adventurers make their way through the streets of Dock Ward, they come upon an unlikely commercial venture.": "当冒险家们穿过码头区的街道时，他们遇到了一个不太可能的商业冒险。",
	"A ramshackle stall set up along the street bears a sign that reads: \"Maps and Poshuns.\" Working the stall is a filthy but cheerful gnome urchin. Several pieces of parchment are on display in the stall, with six small ceramic pots placed next to them.": "一个沿街摆放的破烂摊位上挂着一个牌子，上面写着。\"地图和Poshuns\"。摆摊的是一个脏兮兮但却很欢快的地精顽童。摊位上摆着几张羊皮纸，旁边放着六个小陶罐。",
	"The potions have a faintly fruity aroma. A {@spell detect magic} spell shows that they are indeed magical, though that magic is of the transmutation school rather than conjuration. Each day, a kindly druid who thinks Jerr is an honest soul gives the gnome a goodberry for his health. Rather than eat the berry, Jerr crushes it up and adds a drop of juice to each pot. Jerr sells maps for 1 gp and the potions for 10 gp. He also tries to sell other useless or counterfeit objects at your discretion.": "这些药水有一种淡淡的水果香味。一个{@spell detect magic}的咒语显示它们确实有魔力，尽管这种魔力是转化学派的，而不是魔法。每天，一个好心的德鲁伊认为杰尔是一个诚实的灵魂，他给地精一个好的浆果，让他健康。杰尔没有吃浆果，而是把它压碎，在每个锅里加一滴果汁。杰尔以1戈比出售地图，以10戈比出售药水。他还试图出售其他无用或伪造的物品，由你决定。",
	"If you wish, Jerr can become a recurring character in the campaign. He might keep tabs on the characters as they grow famous, showing up in cities where they travel, trying to sell more useless goods, or eventually spying on them for the Zhentarim. Or if paid and treated well, he could become a valuable source of information for the characters when they need someone to infiltrate tough areas.": "如果你愿意，杰尔可以成为活动中的一个重复出现的角色。他可能会在人物成名后盯着他们，出现在他们旅行的城市里，试图出售更多无用的货物，或者最终为Zhentarim监视他们。或者，如果得到报酬和良好的待遇，当人物需要有人潜入艰难地区时，他可以成为一个有价值的信息来源。",
	"As the characters make their way farther into Dock Ward, they encounter street thugs growing increasing resentful of the presence of the City Watch. These thugs need to earn some quick coin, then lay low until the Watch leaves the ward. And mugging the next group of distracted strangers to wander down the wrong street seems like just the ticket.": "随着人物深入到码头区，他们遇到了街头暴徒，对城市守望的存在越来越反感。这些暴徒需要快速赚取一些钱财，然后在守望先锋离开区之前低调行事。抢劫下一群在错误的街道上徘徊的心不在焉的陌生人，这似乎正是机会。",
	"The four {@creature bandit} members of the crew are run-of-the-mill criminals looking to get ahead in the world through treachery. Their leader, {@creature Jelayne|OoW}, was similar... until she was killed a year before. {@creature Jelayne|OoW} wasn't one to let death keep her down, however, and she continues to lead the group as an unusual {@creature skeleton} with these changes:": "船员中的四个{@creature bandit}成员是普通的罪犯，希望通过背叛在这个世界上出人头地。他们的首领{@creature Jelayne|OoW}也是如此......直到一年前她被杀。然而，{@creature Jelayne|OoW}并不是一个让死亡阻挡她的人，她继续作为一个不寻常的{@creature skeleton}来领导这个团体，而这些变化。",
	"She has Intelligence and Charisma scores of 14 (+2).": "她的智力和魅力评分为14分（+2）。",
	"She can speak Common.": "她能说普通话。",
	"{@creature Jelayne|OoW} isn't aware that she's undead. Even though the last of her flesh is constantly sloughing off her, she dismisses that effect as \"allergies.\" The rest of the crew don't know what to do, since {@creature Jelayne|OoW} has kept her intellect, knowledge, and personality. They have always followed her and done fine for themselves, so why let death interfere with a good thing?": "{@creature Jelayne|OoW}并不知道她是不死之身。尽管她最后的肉体在不断地从她身上脱落，但她把这种影响当作 \"过敏 \"来看待。其他船员不知道该怎么办，因为(1%)保持了她的智力、知识和个性。他们一直跟着她，自己做得很好，为什么要让死亡来干扰一件好事？",
	"When the encounter begins, read:": "当遭遇开始时，请阅读。",
	"A figure stands in the alleyway, its luminous eyes glowing beneath a dark hood. As the hood is pulled away to reveal a skeletal face, the figure unexpectedly speaks. \"Your money or your life!\"": "一个人影站在巷子里，发光的眼睛在黑暗的兜帽下闪闪发光。当兜帽被拉开，露出一张骷髅脸时，这个人影出乎意料地开口了。\"要么你的钱，要么你的命！\"",
	"The other members of the crew hide in adjacent alleyways or on the rooftop of a nearby building. They enter the fray if the characters don't surrender their valuables immediately.": "其他成员躲在邻近的巷子里或附近建筑物的屋顶上。如果这些人物不立即交出他们的贵重物品，他们就会加入战斗。",
	"If the adventurers defeat the crew and study {@creature Jelayne|OoW}, a successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Religion}) check confirms that she was raised as undead by a unique ritual that allowed her to keep her intellect and ability to speak. This has no bearing on the encounter, but sets up the existence of such rituals as foreshadowing for later events. See the \"{@area A Horse is a Corpse, of Course|088|x}\" section and \"{@area The Magic of Convenience|08e|x}\" sidebar in episode 2 for more information.": "如果冒险者打败了船员并研究了{@creature Jelayne|OoW}，成功通过DC10智力({@skill Arcana}或{@skill Religion})检查，证实她是由一个独特的仪式养成的不死生物，使她能够保持智力和说话的能力。这对这次遭遇没有影响，但为以后的事件埋下了这种仪式存在的伏笔。更多信息请参见第二集的\"{@area A Horse is a Corpse, of Course|088|x} \"部分和\"{@area The Magic of Convenience|08e|x} \"侧边栏。",
	"If the characters develop a strong interest in creating undead horses or summoning will-o'-wisps to their service, you can decide to reveal the \"unique rituals\" Hoobur knows, which can show up as treasure in the adventure or be something that the characters can learn through research. Otherwise, just assume that like many classic villains, Hoobur Gran'Shoop has access to whatever magic is necessary to advance the plot in the most interesting way.": "如果人物对创造不死马或召唤精灵为他们服务产生了浓厚的兴趣，你可以决定揭示胡伯所知道的 \"独特的仪式\"，这些仪式可以在冒险中作为宝物出现，也可以是人物可以通过研究学会的东西。否则，就假设像许多经典的反派一样，胡伯-格兰肖普可以使用任何必要的魔法，以最有趣的方式推进情节。",

	"Continuing on through Dock Ward, the characters catch unexpected sight of a kidnapping.": "继续穿过Dock Ward，人物意外地看到了一起绑架案。",
	"An old male human hobbles up the street, his long staff bearing most of his weight. His wrinkled face tells a tale of many hard years lived in poverty. As he passes an alleyway entrance, he looks up at you and grins, revealing his last few remaining teeth. But even as he opens his mouth as if to speak, a pair of meaty gray arms emerge from the alley entrance and yank him into the darkness.": "一个年老的男性人类蹒跚地走在街上，他的长杖承受着他的大部分重量。他那张布满皱纹的脸诉说着多年来在贫困中生活的艰辛。当他经过一个小巷的入口时，他抬头看着你，咧嘴一笑，露出了他仅存的几颗牙齿。但就在他张开嘴似乎要说话的时候，一双肉乎乎的灰色手臂从巷子口冒了出来，把他拽进了黑暗中。",

	"The thugs grabbed Kal because they heard the old fool can predict the future. They don't want to hurt him, but simply hope to persuade him to help them make as much coin as possible with little risk.": "这些暴徒抓住了卡尔，因为他们听说这个老傻瓜能预测未来。他们并不想伤害他，只是希望说服他帮助他们在风险不大的情况下尽可能多地赚取钱财。",
	"If the characters save Kal, he looks at them with the same grin. He doesn't express gratitude, though, because his mind wanders through a different level of existence, as is the case for many mystics, celebrities, and financial planners. He laughs when asked a question. He answers questions that no one asked. He nods but says no, or vice versa, even when he has no reason to do so. However, when the second sight grips him, all that changes.": "如果这些人物救了卡尔，他也会用同样的笑容看着他们。不过他并不表示感谢，因为他的思想在不同层次的存在中徘徊，就像许多神秘主义者、名人和财务规划师一样。当被问到一个问题时，他笑了。他回答没有人问的问题。他点头却说不，或者反过来说，即使他没有理由这样做。然而，当第二道视线抓住他时，这一切都改变了。",
	"Kal's eyes come into focus and he becomes as sober as a priest of Ilmater at sunup. \"Their plans are afoot,\" he whispers. \"Their staff are ready. Their balance sheets are totaled, and that total is grim. They mean to bring the end of all things! You must seek the magic! Only you can stop them! Only you! You... are who again, sorry?\"": "卡尔的眼睛开始聚焦，他变得像日出时分伊尔马特的牧师一样清醒。\"他们的计划正在进行中，\"他低声说。\"他们的工作人员已经准备好了。他们的资产负债表已经计算出来了，而这个数字是严峻的。他们的目的是带来万物的终结! 你必须寻找魔法! 只有你能阻止他们! 只有你! 你......是谁来着，对不起？\"",

	"{@creature Devil Dog|OoW} carries nothing of value, but in exchange for her life, she promises to take her captors back to her apartment, where she says she keeps her money.

	"Eventually, the characters spot the sign for Jolly's Lamp Emporium. Read the following as they move toward their goal:": "最后，这些人物发现了乔利灯饰店的招牌。在他们朝着目标前进时，请阅读以下内容。",
	"Jolly's Lamp Emporium is an unassuming, ramshackle shop in the midst of other unassuming, ramshackle shops—including the collapsed warehouse next door.

No one else is on the street, except a seemingly inebriated halfling who stumbles toward you.": "Jolly's Lamp Emporium是一家不起眼的破烂商店，位于其他不起眼的破烂商店中间--包括隔壁的倒塌的仓库。当你走近时，附近商店和公寓里的人们透过他们的百叶窗警惕地看着你。在仓库旁边，有三名沃特迪普城市守卫的成员站岗。街上没有其他人，只有一个看起来醉醺醺的半身人跌跌撞撞地向你走来。",

	"When the characters approach, Captain Truff steps forward, tells them that the area is off-limits, and orders them to move along.

	"To gain access to the warehouse and the sinkhole fissure, the characters must pretend to be the named adventurers. Assume that the City Watch members know the names and reputations of some of the adventurers on the list, but have never met them in person. If a character pretends to be Lord Pompy Fuggelstruck and speaks to the guards, Captain Truff might think it odd that they aren't speaking with Fuggelstruck's well-known lisp, or predilection for using rhyming couplets, or what have you. You can let roleplaying determine the outcome, or call for DC 10 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) checks for the characters to pass off any outright lies.": "为了进入仓库和天坑裂缝，角色们必须假装是被点名的冒险家。假设城市守望的成员知道名单上一些冒险家的名字和名声，但从未见过他们本人。如果一个角色假装是Pompy Fuggelstruck勋爵并和守卫说话，Truff队长可能会觉得奇怪，因为他们没有用Fuggelstruck著名的口齿不清，或者喜欢使用押韵的对联，或者其他什么。你可以让角色扮演来决定结果，或者要求对人物进行DC10魅力（{@skill Deception}）检查，以掩盖任何公然的谎言。",
	"Captain Truff is eager to get someone—anyone—to investigate the fissure as soon as possible, allowing her to go back to her normal duties.

	"The fissure opened beneath the warehouse during the earthquake two days ago. The partially collapsed building has been deemed structurally sound, so it shouldn't fall into the fissure unless someone inside does something foolish, such as knock down a support beam or bang against the remaining walls.": "两天前的地震中，仓库下面的裂缝打开了。部分倒塌的建筑被认为结构良好，所以它应该不会落入裂缝，除非里面有人做了一些愚蠢的事情，比如打倒一根支撑梁或撞到剩余的墙壁。",

Captain Truff is clear in articulating her hopes that the adventurers can wrap up the investigation quickly. Every second she spends in this unruly section of Dock Ward grates on her nerves.": "三名守卫被命令留在现场，直到完成对裂缝的探索。特鲁夫船长明确表示，她希望冒险家们能够迅速结束调查。她在Dock Ward这个不守规矩的地方度过的每一秒钟都让她感到不安。",

	"When the fissure opened up at the bottom of the sinkhole, it exposed a number of tunnels used for a variety of purposes and by a multitude of people over the years. The first of the tunnels beneath the warehouse were dug as smugglers' byways. Later, worshipers of That-Which-Endures (see the sidebar in the \"{@book New Race: Verdan|AI|2|New Race: Verdan}\" section in chapter 3) excavated chambers beneath the ground to hold clandestine meetings and worship at a secret shrine of destruction. Various thieves' guilds employed the tunnels to move from place to place secretly. Renegade wizards did terrible experiments there. At one point, part of the Waterdeep sewer system crossed into the tunnel network. Not long after, the subterranean spaces were abandoned.": "当天坑底部的裂缝打开时，它暴露了许多隧道，多年来被许多人用于不同的目的。仓库下面的第一条隧道是作为走私者的通道而挖掘的。后来，那啥啥的崇拜者（见第三章\"{@book New Race: Verdan|AI|2|New Race: Verdan} \"部分的侧边栏）在地下挖掘了一些房间，举行秘密会议，并在一个秘密的毁灭圣地进行崇拜。各种盗贼行会利用这些隧道从一个地方秘密地转移到另一个地方。叛逆的巫师们在那里做着可怕的实验。有一次，沃特迪普下水道系统的一部分穿过了隧道网络。不久之后，地下空间被遗弃了。",
	"As a result of the earthquake, many of the tunnel system's side passages have been blocked by rubble. The limited zone that is still traversable leads the characters from the fissure to the lost shrine of destruction—and through a number of dangerous areas in between.": "由于地震的影响，隧道系统的许多侧面通道都被瓦砾堵住了。仍可穿越的有限区域将人物从裂缝引向失落的毁灭圣地--并在两者之间穿过一些危险区域。",

	"The two {@creature Darkmantle||darkmantles} understand that the dragon is doomed to eventually die of its wounds, and that they can have an easy meal in a few hours if they bide their time. They are thus staying out of the dragon's reach. Dabshabah can't use her breath weapon against the darkmantles because the weight of the boulders makes it hard for her to breathe.": "这两个人{@creature Darkmantle||darkmantles}明白，这条龙注定最终会死于伤痛，而如果他们韬光养晦，几个小时后就能轻松吃上一顿。因此，他们在龙的视线范围之外。达布沙巴不能用她的呼吸武器来对付黑曼陀罗，因为巨石的重量使她难以呼吸。",
	"When the characters engage the darkmantles, the monsters ignore the dragon to focus on the new threat. Both creatures fight to the death.": "当人物与黑魔兽交战时，怪物们无视龙的存在，专注于新的威胁。两种生物都在拼死搏斗。",
	"Dabshabah is less than a year old, and she shares the story of how a green dragon attacked her and her siblings, driving her away from her mother's territory and down the Sword Coast. She can also confirm that she saw an armed and armored female human—Sergeant Ava Teeshe—pass through this chamber and head east some hours ago. Dabshabah kept silent, fearing the human would slay her.": "达布沙巴还不到一岁，她讲述了一条绿龙如何袭击她和她的兄弟姐妹，把她从母亲的领地赶到剑海岸的故事。她还可以证实，她看到一个武装和装甲的女性人类--艾娃-提舍中士--在几个小时前穿过这个房间，向东走去。达布沙巴保持沉默，担心这个人类会杀了她。",
	"Large capital assets such as dragons are a good investment. But you need to remember to record them on your balance sheet at the original cost minus depreciation due to the minor dismemberment or occasional consumption of staff.": "像龙这样的大型资本资产是一项不错的投资。但你需要记住在资产负债表上以原始成本减去因员工的轻微肢解或偶尔的消耗而产生的折旧来记录它们。",
	"Waterdeep is protected by a magical ward that keeps dragons from entering the city. The ward doesn't reach this far below ground, so Dabshabah is safe here. However, if the characters attempt to bring her out of the fissure, she can't follow them. The dragon whines and sobs when it becomes clear that the characters must leave her behind. Arranging to meet somewhere outside the city quiets her, but Dabshabah demands assurances that the party won't abandon her.": "沃特德普受到一个魔法阵的保护，使龙无法进入城市。这个魔法阵并没有到达地下这么远，所以达布沙巴在这里是安全的。然而，如果角色们试图把她带出裂缝，她就不能跟着他们。当角色们清楚地知道必须把她留下时，这条龙就会呜呜地哭起来。安排在城外的某个地方见面使她安静下来，但达布沙巴要求保证党不会抛弃她。",
	"It might be fun to run Dabshabah as an NPC member of the party for a bit. However, any dragon—even a chaotic good wyrmling—can be tough to manage. Townsfolk are likely to be terrified at the prospect of a dragon coming into their shops and taverns. Moreover, caring for Dabshabah to her own high standards, including meeting her needs for sustenance and treasure, is equivalent to maintaining a character in a wealthy lifestyle.": "将达布沙巴作为党内的一个NPC成员来管理可能会很有趣。然而，任何龙--即使是混乱的好巫妖--都很难管理。镇民们可能会因为一条龙进入他们的商店和酒馆而感到害怕。此外，按照她自己的高标准照顾达布沙巴，包括满足她对食物和财宝的需求，相当于维持一个角色的富裕生活。",
	"That said, having Dabshabah stay with the party for a short time, then take off on her own to learn the business of being a dragon, could provide a bit of poignant narrative in your campaign. Much later on, if the characters are ever facing long odds in an important battle, Dabshabah might swoop down from the sky to return the favor the heroes once did for her.": "也就是说，让Dabshabah和队伍呆上一小段时间，然后自己去学习做龙的事情，可以在你的战役中提供一点凄美的叙述。以后，如果角色们在一场重要的战斗中面临巨大的困难，达布沙巴可能会从空中俯冲下来，以回报英雄们曾经对她的帮助。",
	"In this final area of the caverns, the characters discover the missing City Watch guard, the dead dwarf who caused all this mess—and a magical mystery that kicks off the rest of the adventure. When the characters enter this area, read:": "在岩洞的最后一个区域，角色们发现了失踪的城市守卫，发现了造成这一切混乱的死去的侏儒--还有一个神奇的谜团，开启了冒险的其他部分。当人物进入这个区域时，请阅读。",
	"This crumbling chamber is dominated by an altar against the far wall, above which hangs some kind of construct gearwork mechanism ending in a massive maul. The wall to the left of the altar has fallen in to spread rubble across the floor. On the floor near the altar is a golden device resembling an orrery housing. The device is battered and falling apart, revealing exposed gears and spokes, and with its exterior pieces and plating scattered across the floor. Splayed on the ground next to the device is the corpse of a dwarf.": "这个破败的密室被一个靠着远处墙壁的祭坛所支配，上面悬挂着某种结构性的齿轮装置，最后形成一个巨大的大锤。祭坛左侧的墙壁已经倒塌，碎石遍布地板。祭坛附近的地板上有一个金色的装置，类似于一个圆形的外壳。这个装置被撞得七零八落，露出了暴露的齿轮和辐条，其外表的碎片和镀层散落在地板上。在装置旁边的地面上，躺着一具矮人的尸体。",
	"In the southwest corner of the room stands a muscular female human dressed in the livery of the Waterdeep City Watch. Her eyes are closed, and she breathes deeply as though resting.": "在房间的西南角，站着一个肌肉发达的女性人类，穿着沃特迪普城市守卫的制服。她闭着眼睛，深呼吸，似乎在休息。",
	"Teeshe touched the altar when she first entered this area, and a spirit loyal to That-Which-Endures possessed her (see below). If the adventurers touch or disturb anything in this chamber (including the altar, the gearwork maul, or Teeshe herself), the spirit controlling Sergeant Teeshe forces her to attack. Use the {@creature thug} stat block for her in this state.": "蒂舍在第一次进入这个区域时触碰了祭坛，一个忠于That-Which-Endures的灵魂附身于她（见下文）。如果冒险者触碰或打扰这个密室中的任何东西（包括祭坛、齿轮加工锤或蒂谢本人），控制蒂谢中士的灵魂会迫使她进行攻击。在这种状态下，对她使用{@creature thug}的状态块。",
	"The gearwork device above the altar is called an entropy guardian, and it animates 1 round after Teeshe attacks. The entropy guardian's expanding clockwork arms allow it to attack anywhere in the room, but it cannot attack beyond it. On initiative count 10, it makes two attacks per round: +4 to hit, 7 ({@dice 1d8 + 2}) bludgeoning damage. The damaged entropy guardian is a Huge object with AC 18, 32 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It focuses its attacks on intruders within 5 feet of the altar, anyone fighting with Sergeant Teeshe, and anyone holding the orrery housing (which its magic recognizes as an ongoing threat).": "祭坛上方的齿轮装置被称为 \"熵守护者\"，它在提舍攻击后的1个回合内会产生动画。熵守卫者膨胀的发条臂使它可以攻击房间里的任何地方，但它不能攻击房间以外的地方。在主动权计数为10时，它每回合进行两次攻击。命中率+4，7({@dice 1d8 + 2})重击伤害。受损的熵守护者是一个巨大的物体，AC值为18，命中率为32，对毒药和精神伤害有免疫力。它的攻击重点是在祭坛5英尺范围内的入侵者，任何与特谢中士战斗的人，以及任何持有兽皮箱的人（它的魔法将其识别为持续的威胁）。",
	"The altar is made of granite and covered in runes. It accepts offerings by destroying them with the attacks of the entropy guardian, representing the entropic power of That-Which-Endures. However, the ancient altar malfunctioned when Caerhan set the orrery housing on it—or perhaps the orrery channeled its own powerful magic to destroy the altar in self-defense. Either way, that pulse of power caused the earthquake, and saw the entropy guardian slay the unfortunate Caerhan when it took him as a threat to the shrine.": "祭坛由花岗岩制成，上面布满了符文。它接受祭品的方式是用熵的守护者的攻击来摧毁它们，代表着 \"那个-那个-结束 \"的熵的力量。然而，当卡伊尔汗在祭坛上设置了口器外壳时，古老的祭坛出现了故障--或者也许是口器引导它自己强大的魔法来摧毁祭坛以进行自我防御。不管怎么说，那股力量的脉冲引起了地震，并且看到熵的守护者把不幸的凯尔汉当成了对神殿的威胁而杀死了他。",
	"A character who touches the altar willingly must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be {@condition charmed} by a spirit loyal to That-Which-Endures. While {@condition charmed} in this way, the character must use its action each turn to attack any creature defiling the shrine. This effect lasts for as long as the affected creature remains in this area, but the compulsion also prevents the creature from leaving the shrine.": "一个自愿触碰祭坛的角色必须在DC12魅力救赎中成功，否则就会被一个忠于That-Which-Endures的灵魂所控制。在这样的情况下，该角色必须在每一回合使用其行动来攻击任何玷污神坛的生物。只要受影响的生物还在这个区域内，这个效果就会持续下去，但这个蛊惑也会阻止该生物离开神殿。",
	"If a character tries to identify the runes on the altar, a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Religion}) check determines only that they are connected to no known deity, but that their symbology associates them with the power of destruction and ruin. The magic of the altar and the gearwork maul is faltering, but would once have been capable of destroying even powerful magic items.": "如果一个角色试图识别祭坛上的符文，成功通过DC15智力（{@skill Arcana}或{@skill Religion}）检查，就能确定它们与任何已知的神灵有关，但它们的符号学将它们与破坏和毁灭的力量联系起来。祭坛和齿轮锤的魔力正在减弱，但曾经有能力摧毁强大的魔法物品。",
	"Any character who succeeds on the above check or on a DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to study the destruction here determines that a powerful pulse of magical power centered in this area is likely what caused the earthquake. The character also intuits that with the shrine's destructive magic curtailed by the earthquake, it is no longer a threat.": "任何通过上述检查或通过DC12智力检查来研究这里的破坏情况的人物都会确定，以这个区域为中心的强大的魔法力量脉冲很可能是造成地震的原因。该人物还直觉到，由于地震遏制了神殿的破坏性魔法，它不再是一个威胁。",
	"The {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} is a powerful magic artifact, detailed in {@book appendix D|AI|6}. In its present state, the orrery has been battered by the entropy guardian, though its six-sided form remains intact. Its side plating is mostly missing, but can be collected from the floor nearby. If characters replace any of the shattered side plating, it magically reattaches itself. More oddly, if the characters don't replace the plating, it begins to regrow, even as the orrery housing magically straightens itself out.": "{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}是一件强大的魔法神器，详见{@book appendix D|AI|6}。在其目前的状态下，这口塔已经被熵的守护者击打过了，尽管它的六面体仍然完好。它的侧板大部分都不见了，但可以从附近的地板上收集。如果人物替换了任何一块破碎的侧板，它就会神奇地重新连接起来。更奇怪的是，如果人物不更换镀层，它就会开始重新生长，甚至是像铁匠铺一样神奇地恢复了原状。",
	"Within a few days, the orrery housing is a pristine, golden six-sided device with a circular hole in each face. The setup of gears and attachments within the orrery makes it clear that six round components are meant to be placed into the device. Characters will not recall seeing any such devices in the shrine of destruction.": "几天之内，口轮外壳是一个原始的、金色的六面装置，每个面都有一个圆孔。箭塔内的齿轮和附件的设置清楚地表明，六个圆形的部件是要放入这个装置的。人物不会记得在毁灭神殿中看到过任何这样的装置。",
	"With Sergeant Teeshe saved (or with her body in tow and a convenient cover story), the characters can make their way back to the sinkhole. If they left any dangers behind them on their initial pass, those dangers reemerge on the trip back—and will prevent them from fulfilling their contract if not eliminated.": "在救出特谢中士后（或拖着她的尸体和一个方便的掩护故事），角色们可以回到天坑的路上。如果他们在最初的旅程中留下了任何危险，这些危险就会在回去的路上重新出现--如果不消除这些危险，他们就无法履行合同。",
	"When the characters climb out of the sinkhole, Captain Truff is waiting for them alone, and is pleased to see them. She's even more pleased if the characters rescued Sergeant Teeshe. Truff asks the characters to sign an affidavit confirming that they've completely investigated and cleared the passages beyond the fissure. If the characters lie about the success of their mission, they risk a fine, imprisonment, or both.": "当人物爬出天坑时，特鲁夫船长正独自等待他们，看到他们很高兴。如果角色们救出了Teeshe警长，她会更加高兴。特鲁夫要求他们签署一份宣誓书，确认他们已经完全调查并清理了裂缝之外的通道。如果他们在任务成功的问题上撒谎，就有可能被罚款、监禁，或者两者兼而有之。",
	"The characters must also agree to have all the goods they found beneath the city inventoried. If anyone later claims to be the rightful owner of any of the loot, a magistrate might rule that the goods belong to the original owner instead of the characters. Who knew adventuring required so much paperwork?": "角色们还必须同意将他们在城市下面发现的所有货物清点出来。如果后来有人声称自己是任何战利品的合法主人，地方法官可能会裁定这些货物属于原主人而不是人物。谁知道冒险需要这么多文书工作？",
	"Captain Truff fights alongside the characters, as do Gorkoh and Sergeant Teeshe if the characters rescued them. Otis Adalgrim might show up too, either during or after the fight.": "特鲁夫船长与角色们并肩作战，如果角色们救了他们，戈尔科和提舍中士也会出现。奥蒂斯-阿达格雷姆（Otis Adalgrim）也可能出现，在战斗中或战斗后出现。",
	"With this first episode completed, the characters attain 2nd level! But even as they get to bask in the warm glow of that achievement, they must return to Acquisitions Incorporated to report. Omin Dran is there to meet with them when they do. If the characters were successful and dealt with Captain Truff in good faith, Omin gives them the promised reward of 400 gp for the group (500 gp minus the Acquisitions Incorporated fee). If the characters were only partly successful, adjust Omin's reaction and what follows as necessary.": "随着第一集的完成，角色们达到了第二级！但即使他们可以享受到这一成就的温暖光芒，他们也必须回到收购公司报告。但是，当他们沉浸在这一成就的温暖光芒中时，他们必须回到收购公司报告。当他们返回时，奥明-德兰将在那里与他们会面。如果他们成功了，并且真诚地与Truff船长打交道，Omin会给他们承诺的400gp的奖励（500gp减去收购公司的费用）。如果人物只是部分成功，请根据需要调整奥明的反应和接下来的内容。",
	"Having since learned about the initial mistaken identity when he met the characters, Omin is even more impressed by their success. Or he might be in the mood to demand favors from them if things didn't go entirely as planned (because that kind of mess makes the whole company look bad). Either way, read:": "自从了解了最初遇到人物时的错误身份后，奥明对他们的成功更加印象深刻。或者，如果事情没有完全按计划进行，他可能有心情向他们索要好处（因为那种混乱让整个公司看起来很糟糕）。无论怎样，请阅读。",
	"\"I've been told about the misunderstanding regarding your identities. I can't say much for your relative inexperience and lack of skill.

	"Omin snaps his fingers, and a paper, a pen, and an ink pot leap from his satchel. \"This note gives you the right to travel to Phandalin and investigate the franchise there on my behalf. If you find the franchise in poor standing or otherwise in distress, I want a full report. And depending on how badly the last group botched things, I might look to you to take over. A failed franchise makes the whole company look bad. I'm sure you understand.\"": "奥明打了个响指，一张纸、一支笔和一个墨水罐从他的挎包里跃出。\"这张纸条让你有权前往范达林，代表我调查那里的特许权。如果你发现专营权状况不佳或有其他困难，我要一份完整的报告。根据上一批人把事情搞砸的程度，我可能会找你来接管。一个失败的特许经营权使整个公司看起来很糟糕。我相信你能理解。\"",
	"Omin then levels a hard stare. \"I want you to appreciate what an incredible opportunity this is for you. You're skipping countless steps in the normal franchise process. No internships. No tests. It's unheard of. But I believe in you.\"": "奥明然后狠狠地瞪了一眼。\"我想让你明白这对你来说是一个多么不可思议的机会。你跳过了正常特许经营过程中的无数个步骤。没有实习期。没有测试。这是闻所未闻的。但我相信你。\"",
	"As before, Omin Dran is a busy CEO, and doesn't have time for a lot of questions. If the characters discuss finding the mysterious orrery housing, he tells them to make researching the relic part of their mission. With the characters all newly minted, official Acquisitions Incorporated employees, Omin trusts that they'll know what to do.": "和以前一样，奥明德兰是个忙碌的CEO，没有时间回答很多问题。如果角色们讨论寻找神秘的ORRERY住房，他就告诉他们把研究遗迹作为他们任务的一部分。由于这些人物都是新晋的收购公司正式员工，奥明相信他们会知道该怎么做。",
	"Once the characters formally establish their franchise at the end of episode 2, downtime activities and franchise tasks will play a bigger role in the adventure. For now, though, encouraging the players to engage in downtime activities before heading off for Phandalin can help them get comfortable with the idea of dedicating nonadventuring time to personal and business development.": "一旦人物在第二集末尾正式建立起他们的特许经营权，停工活动和特许经营任务将在冒险中发挥更大的作用。不过现在，在前往范达林之前，鼓励玩家参与停工活动可以帮助他们适应将非冒险时间用于个人和商业发展的想法。",
	"A few possible downtime activities are suggested below, but the party's downtime escapades can include anything that you and the players come up with.": "以下是一些可能的休息时间活动的建议，但聚会的休息时间可以包括你和玩家想出的任何东西。",

	"In episode 2, Omin Dran sends the adventurers (now 2nd level) to Phandalin to learn the fate of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise that opened there a few months earlier but has recently gone dark. After overcoming hazards on the road, the characters enter the town. There, they learn that the franchise had signed an agreement to purchase the oft-ruined Tresendar Manor, a small estate on the outskirts of town. However, something catastrophic occurred at the manor recently, and no one in town has seen any of the occupants since.": "在第二集里，Omin Dran派冒险者（现在是第二级）到Phandalin去了解几个月前在那里开的收购公司专营店的命运，但最近已经黑了。在克服了路上的危险之后，人物进入了小镇。在那里，他们了解到该特许经营权已经签署了一份协议，以购买经常被破坏的特伦达庄园，一个位于镇郊的小庄园。然而，最近庄园里发生了一些灾难性的事情，从那以后，镇上的人都没有见过任何住户。",
	"While in Phandalin, the adventurers have the opportunity to interact with the townsfolk, possibly becoming involved in small-town dramas—including a mayoral election. Those events could have a significant impact on the franchise the characters will establish at the end of this episode.": "在范达林，冒险家们有机会与乡亲们互动，可能会卷入小镇的剧情--包括市长选举。这些事件可能会对人物在本集结束时建立的特许经营权产生重大影响。",
	"After dealing with the threats in the dungeon, the characters run into operatives from Dran Enterprises who have been sent to take control of the site.

	"The appearance of Dran Enterprises at the end of this episode is meant very much to imply that the organization was involved in the attack—and to distract the characters and the players alike from speculating on what other nefarious operators might be involved.

More information on the Six, Splugoth, and Dran Enterprises can be found in \"{@book Factions and Rivals|AI|2|Factions and Rivals}\" in {@book chapter 3|AI|2}, and in {@book appendix B|AI|4}.": "在这一集的结尾，德兰企业的出现在很大程度上是为了暗示该组织参与了这次袭击，并分散人物和玩家的注意力，让他们不去猜测还有哪些邪恶的经营者可能参与其中。在冒险过程中，六人帮的阴谋将被揭露。关于六人帮、Splugoth和Dran企业的更多信息可以在{@book chapter 3|AI|2}的\"{@book Factions and Rivals|AI|2|Factions and Rivals} \"和{@book appendix B|AI|4}中找到。",
	"The trek from Waterdeep to Phandalin requires the adventurers to travel north on the High Road, then head east along the Triboar Trail before taking the track south into town.

In doing so, you don't have to worry about random encounters and setting up details of the journey such as who keeps watch when the characters camp.": "这一集的第一部分有三个奇遇，涵盖了从沃特迪普到潘达林的旅程，所有这些奇遇都提供了与冒险的其他部分的联系。如果你想让你的活动以快速的速度进行，就只进行这些遭遇战。这样一来，你就不必担心随机遭遇和设置旅途中的细节，如人物扎营时由谁看守。",
	"If you prefer to emphasize the dangerous nature of the adventuring life for lower-level characters, random encounters can be used to create additional tension along the road. As characters gain levels and access to diverse powers, random wilderness encounters become less of a threat, so this is a great point in the campaign to use random encounters to challenge the party.": "如果你喜欢强调低级别的角色的冒险生活的危险性，可以用随机遭遇来创造沿途的额外紧张。随着角色等级的提高和获得不同的力量，随机的野外遭遇变得不那么具有威胁性，所以这是活动中使用随机遭遇来挑战队伍的一个好时机。",

	"Kofutacti, a {@creature young green dragon}, is touring the Sword Coast looking for trouble (see the \"{@area Life in Waterdeep|00b|x}\" sidebar in episode 1). Thankfully for the characters, the dragon is a cowardly sort that prefers intimidation to combat, and which backs away from most fights. Kofutacti is the dragon who hunted Dabshabah in episode 1, which could be interesting if the brass wyrmling is with the party, or if the green dragon catches her scent on one of the characters if they've been in recent contact with her.": "Kofutacti，一只{@creature young green dragon}，正在剑海岸巡视，寻找麻烦（见第一集的\"{@area Life in Waterdeep|00b|x} \"侧边栏）。值得庆幸的是，这条龙是个胆小的家伙，喜欢恐吓而不是战斗，在大多数战斗中都会退缩。Kofutacti是第一集里猎杀Dabshabah的那条龙，如果黄铜女妖和队伍在一起，或者如果绿龙在某个角色身上捕捉到她的气味，如果他们最近和她有过接触，这可能会很有趣。",

	"If the characters attempt to involve themselves in the altercation, Rasqel rudely orders them to go do things that are possible only during one of the less-restrained services in a temple of Loviatar. If the characters fail to leave after this warning, Rasqel gives them an ultimatum: they can walk away or face the wrath of the Zhentarim.": "如果人物试图参与争吵，拉斯克尔就会粗暴地命令他们去做只有在洛菲亚塔神庙中的某个不太受约束的仪式中才可能做的事情。如果人物在这一警告后没有离开，拉斯克尔就会给他们下最后通牒：他们可以走开，或者面对赞塔林的愤怒。",
	"If the characters refuse to back down after the second warning, Rasqel orders the bugbears to attack while he hangs back. They obey reluctantly, but if it becomes clear that their lives are in danger at any point, or if the characters offer 10 gp or more to each of them, they walk away and leave their boss to his fate. Rasqel, who is indebted to bad people, fights to the death. If the situation looks grim for the adventurers, Thetsis enters the fray.": "如果角色们在第二次警告后拒绝退缩，Rasqel就会命令虫子们进攻，而他则退缩。他们不情愿地服从，但如果他们的生命显然在任何时候都有危险，或者如果人物向他们每个人提供10戈比或更多，他们就走开，让他们的老板听天由命。负债累累的拉斯凯尔，会拼死一搏。如果情况看起来对冒险者来说很严峻，特西斯就会进入战场。",
	"The bugbears carry nothing of value, as Rasqel has not paid them in several days. The bandit carries 25 gp in his belt pouch.": "虫族没有携带任何有价值的东西，因为拉斯克尔已经好几天没有给他们钱了。匪徒的腰包里有25戈比。",
	"These kinds of side ventures can easily expand to become adventures of their own. For example, one of the franchise NPCs handling the algae trade might fail to return from the Mere of Dead Men one day. The characters need to find out what happened if they want to keep employee morale from tanking—and to keep the business relationship with the lizardfolk intact. Choices must be made and consequences faced, which are the hallmarks of a great campaign.": "这些副业可以很容易地扩展成自己的冒险。例如，处理海藻贸易的一个特许NPC可能有一天没有从死人谷回来。如果他们想保持员工的士气不受影响，并保持与蜥蜴人的业务关系不受影响，他们就需要找出发生了什么。必须做出选择并面对后果，这是一个伟大活动的标志。",
	"The \"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime}\" section in chapter 2 has more information about working ongoing business activities into the franchise's campaign story.": "第二章的\"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime} \"部分有更多关于将正在进行的商业活动纳入特许经营的宣传故事的信息。",
	"The characters might easily recognize that this situation is a prime business opportunity. If not, suggest that realization to a character with a merchant-related background, or one who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) or Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check. Thetsis carries algae that she's willing to sell for 50 gp, but which is worth 100 gp in Waterdeep. More importantly, any character with herbalist or alchemist experience realizes that the algae can be mixed with other reagents costing 150 gp to make a {@item potion of water breathing}. Such a potion might fetch up to 500 gp in a city such as Waterdeep or Neverwinter.": "角色们可能很容易认识到这种情况是一个主要的商业机会。如果没有，建议由一个有商人背景的角色来实现，或者由一个成功通过DC10智力（{@skill Nature}）或智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查的人实现。忒西丝携带的海藻，她愿意以50戈比的价格出售，但在水底世界价值100戈比。更重要的是，任何有草药师或炼金术士经验的人物都会意识到，这些海藻可以和其他价值150戈比的试剂混合，制成{@item potion of water breathing}。这样的药水在水底城或永夜城这样的城市可能会卖到500金币。",
	"After turning east from the High Road onto the Triboar Trail, the characters' travel slows a bit. The High Road is frequently traveled by caravans, and so is better kept and easier to traverse. Triboar Trail, on the other hand, sees less frequent traffic and is less well maintained.": "从大路向东转入特里波尔小道后，人物的旅行速度稍有放缓。高路经常有大篷车经过，所以维护得比较好，比较容易穿越。另一方面，Triboar Trail的交通不那么频繁，维护得也不那么好。",
	"After a few hours' travel east, the adventurers come upon the following scene.": "经过几个小时的东行，冒险者们来到了以下场景。",
	"Sitting cross-legged in the middle of the road is an odd-looking figure wearing not a stitch of clothing. In one hand, he fiddles with a copper medallion etched with the image of a thin, tangled pair of antlers. He might be a beardless dwarf, or a short and pale half-orc, or a human with a gland condition. Either way, he doesn't look up as he speaks in a voice that sounds like a goat choking on sawdust.": "盘腿坐在路中央的是一个看起来很奇怪的人，他没有穿一针一线。他的一只手摆弄着一枚铜质奖章，上面刻着一对细长而纠结的鹿角的图案。他可能是一个没有胡子的侏儒，或者是一个矮小而苍白的半兽人，或者是一个有腺体疾病的人类。无论哪种情况，他都没有抬头，他说话的声音听起来像山羊被锯末噎住。",

	"After initial interactions with the characters, Carkuss asks the following riddle:": "在与人物初步互动后，卡库斯问了以下谜语。",
	"When the characters move off the Triboar Trail and onto the even-less-used track to Phandalin, they stumble into what looks like a by-the-numbers goblin ambush that turns into something much more bizarre. After an hour's travel, the characters come upon the following scene.": "当人物离开Triboar小道，进入到通往Phandalin的更少人使用的小道上时，他们偶然发现了一个看起来很普通的地精伏击，但却变成了更奇怪的事情。经过一个小时的旅行，人物来到了以下场景。",
	"Ahead on the rough road, a pair of dead horses and an overturned cart block your way. Sacks and barrels spilled from the cart litter the ground. Trees grow close to the road here, and the thick undergrowth obscures the view beyond.": "在前方崎岖的道路上，一对死马和一辆翻倒的马车挡住了你的去路。从车上洒落的麻袋和木桶散落在地上。这里的树木紧挨着道路，茂密的树丛遮住了前方的视野。",
	"The gnome archmage Hoobur Gran'Shoop animated these dead horses in the aftermath of the attack on Tresendar Manor, commanding them to lie still and attack any humanoid creatures that approach them.": "地精大法师胡伯-格兰肖普在特伦达庄园遭到袭击后，将这些死马变成了动画，命令它们静静地躺着，攻击任何接近它们的人形生物。",
	"If the characters poke around the rotting flesh that fell of the horses during the battle, they see that each horse bore scars on its sides that form the image of a draconic skull with a sword driven up through it from the bottom. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check recognizes the sigil as part of a unique necromantic ritual that can turn any creature into an undead creature when it dies. (The characters will see this rune and this magic again later. See the sidebar \"The Magic of Convenience\" below for more information.)": "如果人物在战斗中探查马匹上掉落的腐肉，就会发现每匹马的侧面都有伤痕，形成一个龙人头骨的形象，有一把剑从底部刺入其中。通过DC10智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查成功的角色认识到这个符文是一个独特的亡灵仪式的一部分，这个仪式可以在任何生物死后将其变成不死生物。(人物以后会再次看到这个符文和这个魔法。更多信息请参见下面的侧边栏 \"便利的魔法\"）。",
	"Most of the crates, sacks, and barrels that litter the road and the wagon have already been emptied of valuables. One cask of Luskan Ice Mead remains intact among the looted goods, worth 50 gp in Phandalin. Alternatively, the characters can get 200 gp for it in Waterdeep, where patrons won't realize that ice mead is just normal mead in Luskan.": "路上和马车上随处可见的板条箱、麻袋和木桶，大部分已经被清空了贵重物品。在被抢的货物中，有一桶卢斯坎冰蜂蜜酒仍然完好无损，在潘达林价值50金币。另外，人物可以在沃特迪普得到200金币，那里的顾客不会意识到冰蜂蜜酒在卢斯坎只是普通蜂蜜酒。",
	"After a harrowing and potentially lucrative journey, the characters arrive in Phandalin. Map 2.1 shows the layout of the small town, with key locations described in the sections below.": "在经历了一段艰辛而又可能有利可图的旅程后，人物抵达了范达林。地图2.1显示了这个小城的布局，关键位置在下面的章节中有所描述。",
	"Read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:": "阅读或转述以下内容以设定场景。",
	"This modest-sized town is comprised of some fifty buildings, most of which show signs of regular upkeep. Farms and an apple orchard mark the outer edge of town, with houses and shops closer in. Townsfolk are milling about in the central square and on the adjacent green. Two people stand on a stage on the green, addressing the crowd, but the distance to them—along with a steady chorus of cheers, boos, and shouts—obscures what's being said.": "这个规模不大的小镇由大约50座建筑组成，其中大部分都有定期维护的迹象。农场和一个苹果园标志着城镇的外围，房屋和商店则更接近。镇民们在中央广场和邻近的绿地上闲逛。两个人站在绿色的舞台上，向人群讲话，但与他们的距离--伴随着不断的欢呼声、嘘声和叫喊声--掩盖了正在说的内容。",
	"Rising from a small hill overlooking the town is an old manor house—or at least it was an old manor house. Most of its walls have collapsed in what appears to be a recent disaster, with traces of smoke still rising from piles of tumbled stone.": "在俯瞰小镇的一座小山上，耸立着一座古老的庄园，或者至少它曾经是一座古老的庄园。它的大部分墙壁都在最近的一场灾难中倒塌了，烟雾的痕迹仍然从翻滚的石头堆中升起。",
	"When the characters approach the stage or try to slip away, continue:": "当人物接近舞台或试图溜走时，继续。",
	"A portly, well-dressed male human on the stage points unexpectedly at your group and shouts. \"You see? This is exactly what I mean! Just when things start to calm down in Phandalin, more murderous vagrants show up. They probably have something to do with what's happened to Tresendar Manor, and with the livestock that have started going missing! And it's only a matter of time before this all ends in misery and bloodshed, I promise you!\"": "舞台上一个身材魁梧、衣着光鲜的男性人类出乎意料地指着你们这群人喊道。\"你们看到了吗？这正是我的意思! 就在潘达林的事情开始平静下来的时候，更多的杀人的流浪者出现了。他们可能与特伦达庄园发生的事情有关，也与开始失踪的牲畜有关！\"。而这一切迟早会在痛苦和流血中结束，我向你保证！\"",
	"Phandalin was long run by an elected townmaster, until trouble with bandits some years ago saw the townmaster replaced by a council of three prominent citizens, elected every two years. However, the recent abdication of one councilor and the town's growing size have prompted the townsfolk to decide that it's time to expand the council to five persons, and to incorporate a mayorship to handle increasingly important decisions about Phandalin's future.": "长久以来，范达林由选举产生的镇长管理，直到几年前与强盗发生纠纷，镇长才被每两年选举一次的由三位杰出公民组成的理事会取代。然而，最近一位议员的退位和小镇规模的扩大促使镇民们决定是时候将议会扩大到五人，并设立市长职位来处理有关范达林未来的越来越重要的决定。",
	"Two people, both current councilors, are running for mayor. One is Harbin Wester, a male human with the integrity and unctuous personality of... well, a career politician. Wester is a former townmaster, and is running against Sildar Hallwinter, a male human, member of the Lords' Alliance, and former adventurer. Hallwinter is a circumspect sort who opposes Wester mostly because of the latter's corruption. For more information on both, see the \"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x}\" section.": "有两个人，都是现任议员，正在竞选市长。一个是哈尔滨-维斯特，一个男性人类，具有正直和不苟言笑的个性......嗯，一个职业政治家。威斯特是前镇长，他的竞选对手是西尔达-霍尔温特，一个男性人类，领主联盟成员，前冒险家。霍尔温特是个谨慎的人，他反对维斯特的主要原因是后者的腐败。关于两人的更多信息，请参阅\"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x} \"部分。",
	"Wester is the town's banker and a major landowner, so some consider his wealth and power to be ample justification for his greedy, conniving nature. More importantly, a number of monstrous and magical incidents in the area over many years have left Phandalin's citizens anxious for strong-sounding leadership. Even though adventurers solved many of the town's problems in the past, Wester has gained much popularity by convincing people that the town's troubles would have never surfaced if those well-armed wandering busybodies hadn't gotten involved in the first place. The banker has even gone so far as to suggest that adventurers might have orchestrated some of Phandalin's past woes for their own gain.": "威斯特是镇上的银行家和大地主，所以有些人认为他的财富和权力是他贪婪、纵容的充分理由。更重要的是，多年来该地区发生的一些怪物和魔法事件，让范达林的市民们对强大的领导力感到焦虑。尽管过去冒险家们解决了该镇的许多问题，但韦斯特通过说服人们相信，如果那些全副武装的流浪忙人没有参与进来，该镇的麻烦就不会浮现，从而获得了很多人气。这位银行家甚至暗示，冒险家可能为了自己的利益而策划了范达林过去的一些困境。",
	"Sildar Hallwinter isn't a great orator. He spends most of his time refuting Wester's \"unsubstantiated claims.\" The retired warrior also points out that Phandalin needs a leader who knows the dangers of the wilderness, even as its people need a mayor unburdened by scandal and potential conflicts of interest.": "西尔达-霍尔温特并不是一个伟大的演说家。他大部分时间都在反驳韦斯特的 \"未经证实的说法\"。这位退役的战士还指出，范达林需要一个了解荒野危险的领导人，即使其人民需要一个没有丑闻和潜在利益冲突负担的市长。",
	"The characters can become involved in the mayoral debate if the players wish. If they don't, wrap it up and let the characters interact with the townsfolk as they see fit.

	"The Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise previously established in Phandalin. When that group arrived in town a few months ago, they spoke with Harbin Wester about acquiring the ruined Tresendar Manor, since the banker held the property's title. Wester worked out terms with Head Office and the deal was signed. The members of the franchise soon got to work on restoring the manor, frequently coming to town for supplies. When not slipping off to adventure for a few days here and there, most of their time was spent at the manor.": "金色独角兽的联谊会是之前在潘达林建立的收购公司专营权。几个月前，当该组织来到镇上时，他们与哈尔滨-维斯特谈起了收购被毁的特伦达庄园，因为银行家持有该房产的所有权。威斯特与总部制定了条款，交易被签署。特许经营权的成员很快就开始了修复庄园的工作，经常到镇上购买物资。在没有溜去冒险的时候，他们大部分时间都在庄园里度过。",
	"A number of days ago (the same day the franchise's payment was due to Head Office), the townsfolk heard explosions from the manor, with a few people reporting seeing gouts of flame and hearing the commotion of a battle. No one was really keen to investigate, wanting to avoid any trouble that the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose had brought on themselves. (Adventurers, right?) But after a few days passed and no one from the manor came into town, Sildar Hallwinter braved the walk up the hill to investigate.": "几天前（也就是特许经营权付款给总部的同一天），镇民们听到了来自庄园的爆炸声，有几个人报告说看到了火焰的喷发，听到了战斗的骚动。没有人真正热衷于调查，想避免金驼团契给自己带来的任何麻烦。(冒险家，对吗？)但几天过去了，庄园里没有人进城，西尔达-霍尔温特勇敢地走到山上去调查。",

	"Just over a year ago, operatives of the Six came across one of the components of the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}—the {@item far gear|AI}. Quickly realizing the potential power in the component and the orrery it was a part of, they began to scour the Sword Coast for information regarding the artifact. A month ago, their intelligence-gathering resources turned up word that two Acquisitions Incorporated franchises—including the newly minted Phandalin franchise—had been scrutineering for lore about mysterious magic clockwork devices. Wanting to determine what Acquisitions Incorporated might know about the orrery, the leaders of the Six put a plan into motion. (The second franchise was based on the Sword Coast between Neverwinter and Luskan. Its fate will be discovered by the characters in {@adventure episode 3|OoW|3}.)": "就在一年多以前，六人帮的成员发现了{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}的一个部件--{@item far gear|AI}。他们很快意识到这个部件和它所组成的轨道的潜在力量，开始在剑海岸搜寻有关这个神器的信息。一个月前，他们的情报收集资源发现了两个收购公司的特许权--包括新成立的潘达林特许权--一直在仔细研究关于神秘的魔法钟表装置的传说。为了确定收购公司可能知道的关于轨道的信息，六人组的领导人启动了一项计划。(第二个专营权是基于永夜和卢斯坎之间的剑海岸。它的命运将由{@adventure episode 3|OoW|3}中的人物来发现）。",
	"The Six set up an agent in Phandalin—Ditch Fundi, who first raised and now runs Phandalin's new Temple of the Coin Maiden. Using Ditch's intelligence on the activities of the Company of the Golden Mongoose, the Six confirmed that the franchise held an orrery component called the {@item timepiece of travel|AI}—and that Acq Inc head office was so far in the dark about their discovery. So the Six hired a number of agents—including archmage Hoobur Gran'Shoop—to attack both franchises.": "六人组在范达林设立了一个代理人--迪奇-芬迪，他首先提出并现在管理着范达林的新币女寺。利用迪奇关于金龟子公司活动的情报，六人组确认该特许经营权拥有一个名为{@item timepiece of travel|AI}的轨道组件--而Acq公司总部对他们的发现至今一无所知。因此，六人帮雇佣了一些特工--包括大法师胡伯-格兰肖普--来攻击这两家专营店。",

She knows no details of the attack, assuming that the Golden Mongoose adventurers either blew themselves up or summoned a monster they couldn't control.

If the characters set up a franchise in Phandalin, she offers to be their roving representative, procuring goods and services from wherever the characters want to send her. Minghee has a great mind for numbers and a strong head for business, but if the characters take her into their franchise, she becomes restless if denied a regular chance to travel. In the long term, Minghee has the drive and instinct to pick up spellcasting (and use a new stat block of your choice) if any spellcasting character takes the time to mentor her.": "明希相当外向，当人物第一次访问狮盾科斯特时，她就兴奋地与他们打交道（如果他们不访问，她就到其他地方去找）。如果这些人物在潘达林建立了一个专营店，她会成为他们的巡回代表，从这些人物想派她去的地方采购货物和服务。明熙对数字有很好的理解，对商业也有很强的头脑，但如果人物把她纳入他们的特许经营范围，如果没有定期旅行的机会，她就会变得很不安。从长远来看，如果有任何施法者花时间指导她，Minghee有动力和本能去学习施法（并使用你选择的新属性块）。",
	"If the characters take Minghee into their employ, Linene is heartbroken at first, but she soon sees the value in having her daughter working for an up-and-coming franchise. Opportunities might arise for the franchise to enter into an ongoing business arrangement with the Lionshield Coster—which might in turn raise the ire of Sharna Quirstiron at the Miner's Exchange (see below) if the coster's success threatens Sharna's own plans for economic domination.": "如果这些人物把Minghee收为员工，Linene起初很伤心，但她很快就看到了让她的女儿为一个新兴的专营店工作的价值。机会可能会出现，特许经营权将与狮盾造价师达成持续的商业安排--如果造价师的成功威胁到莎尔娜自己的经济统治计划，这可能会反过来引起矿工交易所（见下文）莎尔娜-奎斯特隆的愤怒。",
	"Sharna is thoroughly evil, but she's a fine actor. She has the economic interests of Phandalin at heart, but only because she hopes to have a prosperous town at her mercy when the needs of the Zhentarim become her focus. She ingratiates herself to the characters, hiring them to clear out monsters in the local area that threaten mining interests. She offers to partner up on business deals, sharing the profits of the mines if the characters invest their time or money in such operations. If the characters end up on the wrong side of Harbin Wester, she sides with them against the banker, concealing her goal of usurping his wealth and power. She encourages the characters to actively oppose Wester—or even to kill him if she thinks they might be amenable to the idea.": "莎尔娜是个彻头彻尾的恶魔，但她是个优秀的演员。她把范达林的经济利益放在心上，但只是因为她希望在镇塔林的需求成为她的重点时，能有一个繁荣的小镇任她摆布。她讨好这些人物，雇佣他们清除当地威胁采矿利益的怪物。她提出在商业交易中建立伙伴关系，如果角色在此类行动中投入时间或金钱，就可以分享矿场的利润。如果人物最终站在哈尔滨-维斯特的错误一边，她就会站在他们一边反对银行家，隐瞒她要篡夺他的财富和权力的目标。她鼓励人物积极反对韦斯特，如果她认为他们可能会接受这个想法，甚至可以杀死他。",
	"Although he is getting on in years, Sildar still trains with his weapons and keeps himself in shape. He was one of the town's three councilors prior to (as he puts it), \"Halia Thornton leaving without even saying goodbye.\" By running for mayor against Harbin Wester, Sildar hopes to help Phandalin increase its prosperity—and to put that prosperity into everyone's pockets, not just Wester's. What he lacks in charisma, he makes up for in sincerity.": "虽然他年事已高，但西尔达仍在训练他的武器并保持自己的身材。在（正如他所说的）\"哈利亚-桑顿甚至不辞而别 \"之前，他是镇上的三名议员之一。通过与哈尔滨-维斯特竞选市长，西尔达希望帮助范达林增加繁荣--并将这种繁荣放入每个人的口袋，而不仅仅是维斯特的口袋。他在魅力方面的不足，在真诚方面得到了弥补。",
	"Sildar is a member of the Lords' Alliance, a group of allied leaders concerned with the security and prosperity of the North. As such, his goals are to bring stability and wealth to the region. He is brave and honest, but nearly losing his life years before caused him to doubt not only his martial skills but also his decision making. He could prove to be a valuable ally to the characters, especially if he's elected mayor. However, he might also frustrate them with his passivity and indecisiveness—or allow them to take advantage of those same qualities to wield great influence over him.": "西尔达是领主联盟的成员，这是一个关注北方安全和繁荣的联盟领导人团体。因此，他的目标是为该地区带来稳定和财富。他勇敢而诚实，但几年前差点失去生命，这使他不仅怀疑自己的武功，也怀疑自己的决策。他可能被证明是这些人物的一个有价值的盟友，特别是如果他被选为市长。然而，他的被动和优柔寡断也可能使他们感到沮丧，或者让他们利用这些品质对他产生巨大的影响。",
	"An Acquisitions Incorporated campaign works best when it's running on many levels at once. One of those levels is the business aspects of the characters' lives, with satire another obvious side of the campaign. But politics can be another driving force in an Acq Inc story, as can the satirical treatment of people in power.": "当收购公司的活动同时在许多层面上运行时，它的效果最好。其中一个层次是人物生活的商业方面，讽刺是运动的另一个明显的方面。但是，政治可以成为收购公司故事的另一个驱动力，对当权者的讽刺也可以。",
	"The political maneuverings taking place in Phandalin will inevitably have an impact on the characters and their franchise. Still, if the players aren't interested in the political aspect of the campaign story, don't worry about it. Wester is elected mayor, the players can play nice with him to get what they want, and the story moves forward. But if the characters care about who becomes mayor, they have plenty of opportunity to influence the outcome.": "在潘达林发生的政治演习将不可避免地对人物和他们的特许权产生影响。尽管如此，如果玩家对竞选故事中的政治方面不感兴趣，也不用担心这个问题。威斯特被选为市长，玩家可以和他打好关系以获得他们想要的东西，故事就会向前发展。但如果角色们关心谁成为市长，他们就有很多机会来影响结果。",
	"Sildar Hallwinter cares about the good of the town but is wishy-washy. His lack of charisma hurts his chances for election. But a clever group of adventurers working behind the scenes might be just what Hallwinter needs to energize his campaign. On the other hand, Harbin Wester controls much of the wealth in Phandalin, including Tresendar Manor. As such, helping Wester get elected—or at least not being too obvious about opposing him—can put the characters on his good side. Even if Wester loses the election, his power and wealth mean that the characters will be interacting with him—and dealing with his ability to make their lives easier or harder—whether they want to or not.": "西尔达-霍尔温特关心本镇的利益，但却畏首畏尾。他缺乏魅力，损害了他的选举机会。但是，一群聪明的冒险家在幕后工作，可能正是霍尔温特需要的，以激发他的竞选。另一方面，哈尔滨-维斯特控制着潘达林的大部分财富，包括特伦达庄园。因此，帮助维斯特当选--或者至少不要太明显地反对他--可以让这些人物站在他的一边。即使维斯特在选举中失利，他的权力和财富也意味着人物将与他互动，并与他的能力打交道，使他们的生活变得更容易或更困难，无论他们是否愿意。",
	"Another possibility is that one of the characters could run for office as a last-minute wild-card candidate. A stranger wandering into Phandalin is unlikely to gain the trust of enough citizens to win the race, and the need to stick around town and run things will eventually get in the way of the characters venturing all over the North being heroic. But don't discount the narrative possibilities involved in the characters embracing the political side of the story even more wholeheartedly than you expect them to.": "另一种可能性是，其中一个角色可以作为最后一刻的野生候选人参加竞选。一个流浪到范达林的陌生人不太可能获得足够多的公民的信任来赢得竞选，而且坚持在镇上管理事情的需要最终会妨碍人物在北方各地冒险的英雄主义。但是，不要低估人物比你期望的更全心全意地拥抱政治方面所涉及的叙事可能性。",
	"Garaele was once an agent of the Harpers, though she has recently broken ties with that group of agents opposing the abuse of power. Since then, she has taken significant donations from Dran Enterprises, whose agents asked her to keep an eye on the members of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose and any other Acquisitions Incorporated operatives in Phandalin. Garaele is happy to pass this information along in exchange for Dran Enterprises' payments to the temple, and she asks no questions about that organization's long-term goals for the town. She is a good person, however, so she won't knowingly allow harm to befall others. She is helpful to anyone willing to offer wealth, goods, or services to her shrine.": "Garaele曾经是哈珀斯的一名特工，尽管她最近与那群反对滥用权力的特工断了联系。从那时起，她接受了德兰企业的大量捐赠，德兰企业的代理人要求她密切关注金驼团的成员和任何其他收购公司在潘达林的行动者。Garaele很乐意将这些信息传递出去，以换取德兰企业对寺庙的付款，而且她对该组织在该镇的长期目标不闻不问。不过，她是个好人，所以她不会故意让别人受到伤害。她对任何愿意为她的神殿提供财富、货物或服务的人都很有帮助。",
	"In the days since the destruction of the manor, farmers and herders on the outskirts of Phandalin have reported seeing giant-sized footprints, both humanoid and canine, as well as missing animals. No one has spotted Stuuzant, as the ogre has good instincts for avoiding trouble. She keeps moving, hiding until the time is right to strike. When she attacks livestock, she does so when no one can see her, and she takes only what she needs to survive.": "在庄园被毁后的几天里，范达林郊区的农民和牧民都报告说看到了巨大的脚印，包括人形和犬形的，还有失踪的动物。没有人发现Stuuzant，因为这个食人魔有避免麻烦的良好本能。她一直在移动，躲藏起来，直到时机成熟才出手。当她攻击牲畜时，她会在没有人看到她的时候进行，而且她只拿她需要的东西来生存。",
	"Characters might be asked to look into the missing livestock, or they can do so on their own to get on the good side of the locals. Investigating the disappearances might be used to angle for something the characters want or need, such as supplies, a lower price on Tresendar Manor, citizens favoring one mayoral candidate over another, or whatever else you can think of.": "角色可能被要求去调查失踪的牲畜，或者他们可以自己去调查，以获得当地人的好感。调查失踪事件可以用来争取人物想要或需要的东西，比如物资、特伦达庄园的低价、市民对某个市长候选人的偏爱，或者其他你能想到的东西。",
	"Tracking down and defeating Stuuzant is no easy task, however. She is friends with a pair of {@creature Dire Wolf||dire wolves}, and is mostly successful at covering her tracks after her raids. The ogre also has yet to establish a den in the area, so she rarely stays in one place for more than a day.": "然而，追踪并击败斯图赞特并不是一件容易的事。她和一对{@creature Dire Wolf||dire wolves}的朋友，在她的突袭之后，大多能成功地掩盖她的踪迹。这个食人魔还没有在这个地区建立起一个巢穴，所以她很少在一个地方停留超过一天的时间。",
	"If the characters locate her, Stuuzant speaks Common quite well, uses smarter tactics than a typical ogre, and tries to bargain with the characters if it looks like they might defeat her. If questioned, she tells the story of being hired to attack the manor. A goblin in hooded robes paid her to help break into the estate and smash everything in sight. Stuuzant never saw the goblin's face, and knows nothing about the Six (which was never mentioned to her or any of the other hirelings).": "如果角色们找到她，Stuuzant的普通话说得很好，使用比一般食人魔更聪明的战术，如果角色们看起来有可能打败她，她会试图与角色们讨价还价。如果被问起，她会讲述自己被雇佣来攻击庄园的故事。一个穿着连帽长袍的妖精付钱给她，让她帮助闯入庄园，打碎眼前的一切。斯图赞从未见过那个妖精的脸，也对六人组一无所知（她和其他雇工都没有提到过）。",
	"Savvy characters might convince Stuuzant to take a position in their franchise, with the ogre making a great sentry or bodyguard. However, the townspeople might need assurances to accept such a creature living so close to their town.": "精明的角色可能会说服Stuuzant在他们的特许经营中占据一席之地，让食人魔成为一个伟大的哨兵或保镖。然而，镇民们可能需要得到保证才能接受这样的生物离他们的小镇如此之近。",
	"Stuuzant carries the 50 gp she was paid to help attack the manor.": "斯图赞带着她得到的50金币，帮助攻击庄园。",
	"As they explore Phandalin—and eventually set up their franchise in the town—the characters can engage with many of the town's businesses, whether as patrons or potential partners. The most prominent of the town's locations (as well as a few additional NPCs) are detailed in this section. You can come up with details for additional locations and NPCs based on the needs and desires of your players.": "在探索范达林的过程中--最终在镇上建立了自己的特许经营权--人物可以与镇上的许多企业接触，无论是作为顾客还是潜在的合作伙伴。本节中详细介绍了该镇最突出的地点（以及一些额外的NPC）。你可以根据玩家的需要和愿望，为其他地点和NPC提供细节。",
	"The apple trees of Edermath Orchard surround a small group of buildings on the edge of town. The smell of fruit is strong around the orchard year round, with the apples grown and picked here processed throughout the winter into juice, cider, and other products.": "埃德马斯果园的苹果树围绕着城镇边缘的一小群建筑。果园周围一年四季都弥漫着浓浓的果香，这里种植和采摘的苹果在整个冬季都被加工成果汁、苹果酒和其他产品。",
	"Daran's half-elf daughter Bertice went missing the day before the destruction at Tresendar Manor, and he is beginning to fear for her. Most folk in town know that Bertice recently took up with a human miner named Grovet, who is also missing. If the characters met the couple on the road (see the \"{@area Random Encounters|07a|x}\" table earlier in this episode), they can allay at least some of Daran's fears for his daughter's safety.": "达兰的半精灵女儿贝尔蒂丝在特伦达庄园被毁的前一天失踪了，他开始为她担心。镇上的大多数人都知道贝尔蒂丝最近和一个叫格罗维特的人类矿工在一起，他也失踪了。如果人物在路上遇到这对夫妇（见本集前面的\"{@area Random Encounters|07a|x} \"表），他们至少可以减轻达兰对女儿安全的担忧。",
	"Earning Daran's full trust is a long-term proposition, and the characters must prove themselves beyond reproach in any dealings with the orchardist. If they do, however, the elf proves a valuable ally. He has more resources and power in town than his humble orchard might suggest. And as a member of the Order of the Gauntlet—an association of vigilant adventurers that seeks to overthrow evil—Edermath has the ear of powerful people up and down the Sword Coast.": "赢得达兰的完全信任是一个长期的命题，人物必须在与果园主的任何交易中证明自己无可指责。然而，如果他们做到了，这个精灵就会成为一个有价值的盟友。他在镇上拥有的资源和权力比他那简陋的果园所显示的要多。作为高塔骑士团的成员--一个由警觉的冒险家组成的协会，旨在推翻邪恶--埃德马斯拥有剑海岸上上下下有权势的人的耳朵。",
	"Most of the goods in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} can be purchased here. Linene can special order items for delivery in a few days (with a deposit, of course). However, she doesn't buy, procure, or sell morally questionable goods.": "{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的大部分商品都可以在这里购买。Linene可以特别订购商品，在几天内交货（当然要付定金）。然而，她不购买、采购或出售有道德问题的商品。",
	"This trading post once acted as the central hub for mining activity in the area, as well as the authority for maintaining public records. A two-story building, the exchange bears a newly painted sign depicting two crossed pickaxes above a lump of gold. The first story is where business is conducted, while the second story contains living quarters.": "这个贸易站曾经是该地区采矿活动的中心枢纽，也是维护公共记录的机构。这是一座两层楼的建筑，交易所上有一个新画的标志，上面描绘着两把交叉的镐头，上面是一坨金子。第一层是开展业务的地方，而第二层则是生活区。",
	"As with the Lionshield Coster, most of the goods available in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} can be purchased here.

	"Until a month ago, this temple to Tymora was the only shrine in town.

	"This single-story tavern's better days have seen better days. Its weathered sign probably depicts a prone giant, but whatever paint or carvings once adorned the sign have been all but worn away. Inside, the place shows the same lack of care. It's dirty, ill kept, and in need of a thorough cleaning. Or burning.": "这家单层小酒馆的好日子已经过去了。其风化的招牌可能描绘了一个俯卧的巨人，但不管招牌上曾经装饰过什么油漆或雕刻，都已经被磨掉了。在内部，这个地方也显示出同样的缺乏关怀。它很脏，保管不善，需要彻底清洁。或者烧掉。",
	"The miners that frequent the Sleeping Giant are a rough lot, and could become a competent and formidable force if stirred up and pointed at a target. Currently, Sharna at the Miner's Exchange has their trust (see \"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x}\"), mostly for her assurances that the mines will soon be more prosperous than ever. If Sharna discovers that the characters are interfering with her and the Zhentarim's plans, she need only tell the miners that the characters are standing in the way of their gainful employment to inspire them to use their pickaxes for something other than mining. On the other hand, characters who earn the miners' good will can end up with numerous allies in Phandalin.": "经常光顾 \"沉睡的巨人 \"的矿工是一群粗野的人，如果他们被煽动起来并指向一个目标，就会成为一支有能力的、强大的力量。目前，矿工交易所的莎尔娜得到了他们的信任（见\"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x}\"），主要是因为她保证矿场很快会比以前更繁荣。如果莎尔娜发现这些角色干扰了她和Zhentarim的计划，她只需要告诉矿工，这些角色阻碍了他们有收益的工作，就可以激励他们用镐头做采矿以外的事情。另一方面，赢得矿工好感的角色最终会在范达林拥有众多盟友。",
	"Among the few people in town who are wary of Maza are those who question the nature of Alger's death—including a few malcontents who whisper that perhaps the young smith had a compelling reason to kill her master. Whether these rumors hold truth or are just the ramblings of a would-be ironworker who wants Maza's job is up to you.": "在镇上为数不多的对马扎保持警惕的人中，有一些人质疑阿尔杰之死的性质--包括一些心怀不满的人，他们低声说也许这个年轻的铁匠有令人信服的理由杀死她的主人。这些传言是真实的，还是只是一个想得到马扎工作的铁匠的胡言乱语，取决于你。",
	"The Stonehills are unwitting soldiers in the war for power in Phandalin. Although they own and operate their business, they owe a small amount of money to Harbin Wester. The banker wants to take their business, and he keeps an eye out for any opportunity to gain the necessary leverage. He might use the characters to lean on the Stonehills if they end up owing him favors. Alternatively, if the characters befriend the Stonehills, they might become staunch allies in the family's attempts to keep Wester's hands off their business.": "斯通希尔家族是范达林权力争夺战中不知情的士兵。虽然他们拥有并经营着自己的生意，但他们却欠着哈尔滨维斯特的一小笔钱。银行家想夺取他们的生意，他一直在留意任何可以获得必要筹码的机会。他可能会利用这些人物来靠拢Stonehills家族，如果他们最终欠他人情的话。另外，如果这些人物与斯通希尔家族交好，他们可能会成为该家族试图阻止韦斯特染指他们生意的坚定盟友。",
	"Many fantasy campaigns either ignore questions of law or utilize benevolent authoritarian figures to oversee social and economic justice—the wise monarch, the enlightened town council, the Masked Lords, and so forth. This method means that the law is stable. Higher authorities can be consulted on matters requiring arbitration, with concrete edicts handed down to make the line between right and wrong—in a civil sense, at least—crystal clear.": "许多幻想活动要么忽视法律问题，要么利用仁慈的专制人物来监督社会和经济的公正性--明智的君主、开明的镇议会、蒙面领主等等。这种方法意味着法律是稳定的。在需要仲裁的问题上，可以咨询更高的当局，通过具体的法令，使对与错之间的界限--至少在民事意义上--变得清晰。",
	"In Phandalin (as with many of the other locations in this adventure), the situation is not that simple. No king or council owns the lands of or around the town. Eminent domain is neither implied nor accepted. In most of the smaller settlements along the Sword Coast, the person with power is the individual who takes and holds that power. Locales still have authorities and laws, but the person who can kill everyone else—or pay someone to do so—is the one who truly rules.": "在潘达林（就像这次冒险中的许多其他地点一样），情况并不那么简单。没有国王或议会拥有该镇的或周围的土地。征用权既不隐含也不被接受。在剑海岸的大多数小型定居点中，拥有权力的人是采取并持有这种权力的个人。各地仍有当局和法律，但能杀死其他人的人--或付钱给别人这样做的人--才是真正的统治者。",
	"In Phandalin, Harbin Wester is that person. Even if he loses the mayoral election, his monetary resources far outstrip those of anyone else in the town, leaving him in a position of strong economic control. However, part of Wester's power derives from subtlety. He is wary enough to watch out for anyone with the ability to effectively oppose him, and savvy enough to make sure that such people never have any reason to oppose him. As such, when the characters clean out Tresendar Manor and attempt to use it as the base for their new franchise, a potential for social and economic conflict arises.": "在范达林，哈尔滨-维斯特就是这样的人。即使他在市长选举中失利，他的货币资源也远远超过了镇上的其他人，使他处于强大的经济控制地位。然而，韦斯特的权力部分来自于微妙的手段。他有足够的警惕性，注意任何有能力有效反对他的人，也有足够的智慧，确保这些人永远没有任何理由反对他。因此，当这些人物清理了特伦达庄园并试图将其作为新特许经营权的基地时，社会和经济冲突的可能性就产生了。",
	"Wester holds the mortgage on the manor. The legal entity that was the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was the signatory to that mortgage, and unfortunately for Acquisitions Incorporated, the mortgage is now in arrears. The characters can work a deal to take over those payments, but the terms are steep. Fortunately, after the manor is cleared, Head Office is willing to negotiate for the manor's deed. (See the \"{@area Conclusion|117|x}\" section of this episode for more information.) This leaves Harbin Wester bitter, as he recognizes that having the favor of Acq Inc backing them up gives the characters more potential power in Phandalin than he likes.": "维斯特持有该庄园的抵押权。金色独角兽团契的法律实体是该抵押贷款的签字人，不幸的是，对于收购公司来说，该抵押贷款现在已经拖欠了。角色们可以达成协议来接管这些款项，但条件很苛刻。幸运的是，在庄园被清空后，总部愿意为庄园的契约进行谈判。(详见本集的\"{@area Conclusion|117|x} \"部分）。这让哈尔滨威斯特苦不堪言，因为他认识到，有Acq公司的青睐为他们撑腰，让这些人物在范达林的潜在权力比他喜欢的更大。",
	"As the rest of the campaign plays out, keep track of how Wester might try to take advantage of the characters and their deal. What if operatives of Dran Enterprises or representatives of the Six come to him? More importantly, if the characters directly oppose Wester and bring him low, what happens if a worse power steps in to take his place? The options are limitless. Do what challenges and entertains your players most!": "在接下来的活动中，要注意韦斯特可能会如何利用这些人物和他们的交易。如果德兰企业的特工或六人帮的代表来找他怎么办？更重要的是，如果角色们直接反对维斯特，使他的地位下降，那么如果有更坏的势力介入，取代他的位置，会发生什么？选择是无限的。做到挑战和娱乐你的玩家最多!",
	"Half a year past, another general store in Phandalin called Barthen's Provisions went out of business. The building was purchased a month ago for the church of Waukeen by an unknown benefactor, and quickly renovated with all the fineries necessary to draw the attention of the goddess of wealth. The gnome Ditch Fundi oversaw the temple's construction and dedication, and she now runs it in Waukeen's name.

	"This one-story hall is the closest thing the people of Phandalin have to a government building. Long used as the town council's meeting room and the townmaster's hall before that, it is set to be expanded to include the new mayor's office after the election. As the two remaining members of the town council, Sildar Hallwinter and Harbin Wester currently share office space here.": "这个一层楼的大厅是范达林人民最接近政府大楼的地方。长期以来，它被用作镇议会的会议室和之前的镇长大厅，在选举之后，它将被扩大到包括新镇长的办公室。作为镇议会剩下的两名成员，西尔达-霍尔温特和哈尔滨-维斯特目前在这里共享办公空间。",
	"After the characters have met some of the locals and heard what's known about the events at Tresendar Manor and the disappearance of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose, they can investigate the fallen manor and the dungeons beneath it. Once a small but elegant estate, the ruined building sits upon a hill overlooking Phandalin. Years of neglect had already done considerable damage to the structure, only some of which the Golden Mongoose adventurers had restored. But the recent attacks undid all that work, pulling most of the above-ground structure down.": "在人物认识了一些当地人，并听说了关于特伦达庄园事件和金驼团员失踪的情况后，他们可以调查这个倒塌的庄园和它下面的地牢。这座破败的建筑曾经是一个小而优雅的庄园，坐落在俯瞰潘达林的山丘上。多年的忽视已经对该建筑造成了相当大的破坏，只有部分被金枪鱼冒险家们修复了。但最近的攻击使所有的工作都付诸东流，将大部分的地面结构拉倒了。",
	"The orrery's components are set up so that their magic gets weird while the orrery is in pieces. At your determination, that magic might act in unpredictable ways, not recharge as often as normal, or add random effects to keep the characters on their toes. One aspect of this unpredictability comes into play in the adventure when the tiefling Talanatha uses the {@item timepiece of travel|AI} to escape from the attack on Tresendar Manor, only to have the timepiece stay behind (see later on in this episode for details).": "箭塔的组件被设置成在箭塔被破坏的时候，它们的魔法会变得很奇怪。在你的决定下，这些魔法可能会以不可预测的方式发挥作用，不象正常情况下那样频繁地充能，或者增加随机效果以使人物保持警惕。这种不可预测性的一个方面在冒险中出现了，当铁皮人塔拉纳塔使用{@item timepiece of travel|AI}从对特伦达庄园的攻击中逃脱时，计时器却被留下来了（详见本集后面）。",
	"When the characters reach the top of the hill and get a closer look at the ruins of Tresendar Manor, read the following:": "当人物到达山顶，仔细观察特伦达庄园的废墟时，请阅读以下内容。",
	"Many of the crumbled walls of the manor show signs of having been recently rebuilt, but even that newer stonework has been toppled and smashed, coating everything in the area with a thick layer of dust. Temporary structures seemingly set up to aid the reconstruction have been badly damaged by force and fire, though a couple of wooden buildings still stand amid the destruction.": "庄园的许多坍塌的墙壁显示出最近被重建的迹象，但即使是那些较新的石制品也被推倒和砸碎，给该地区的一切都涂上了一层厚厚的灰尘。似乎是为了帮助重建而建立的临时建筑已经被武力和火灾严重破坏，尽管有几座木制建筑仍然矗立在破坏之中。",

	"Hamebi works for the Six, although she doesn't know it. If captured, she can relate that a short, cloaked humanoid came to her in Neverwinter Wood two days ago, hiring her to bring her pack of jackals to Phandalin and search the ruins for bodies. This was Splugoth, unconvinced by Hoobur Gran'Shoop that the orrery component known to be held by the Golden Mongoose company is gone from the area; see the note in {@area area 12|10b|x} of the Tresendar Manor dungeons. Splugoth wanted creatures with keen scent to make another attempt at locating any franchise dead.": "哈梅比为六人帮工作，虽然她不知道。如果被抓到，她可以说两天前在永冬森林有一个矮小的、隐身的人形生物来找她，雇佣她带着她的豺狼人队伍去范达林，在废墟中搜寻尸体。这是Splugoth，他不相信Hoobur Gran'Shoop的说法，即已知由Golden Mongoose公司持有的ORRERY组件已从该地区消失；见Tresendar Manor地牢的{@area area 12|10b|x}的说明。斯普鲁戈斯希望有敏锐嗅觉的生物再次尝试寻找任何特许经营的死者。",

More on Hoobur will be revealed in {@adventure episode 3|OoW|3}.)": "此外，仍然存在的结构的墙壁上有一个白垩的标记--双 \"D \"标志。这就是德兰企业的标志。作为熟悉收购公司运作的冒险者，所有人物都能认出Acq公司最大的对手组织的标记。(这些标记是由大法师胡伯-格兰肖普（Hoobur Gran'Shoop）刻画的，他被六人组责成确保德兰企业为在范达林（Phandalin）对Acq公司特许经营权的攻击承担责任。关于胡伯的更多信息将在{@adventure episode 3|OoW|3}中披露。）",

She tells the characters that she worked for the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise in Phandalin, and that while working on their ongoing renovation of Tresendar Manor, the franchisees were attacked at night by unknown assailants. Gildha knows few details of the attack and heard little of the aftermath. Though she saw one of her group escape by teleporting away, she isn't sure what happened to the others. Falling rubble knocked her down, then buried her. Surviving on nothing but rainwater and her half-orc endurance, Gildha has been in and out of consciousness since the attack.": "如果给她以魔法治疗或在给她食物和水后让她睡上一小时，吉尔达就会恢复理智。她告诉这些人物，她在范达林的收购公司（Acquisitions Incorporated）工作，当他们正在对特伦达庄园进行改造时，加盟商在夜间遭到了不明身份的袭击者的攻击。Gildha对袭击的细节知之甚少，对袭击后的情况也听得不多。虽然她看到她的小组中的一个人通过传送逃走了，但她不确定其他人发生了什么。坠落的瓦砾将她击倒，然后埋葬了她。除了雨水和她的半兽人耐力外，吉尔德哈在袭击发生后一直处于意识模糊状态。",
	"{@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW|Gildha} knows a little about the device, which she calls the {@item timepiece of travel|AI}. The Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose found the relic six months ago in the possession of an evil adventuring band, who claimed to have taken it not long before from a tomb haunted by undead. After careful scrutineering and research, the Golden Mongoose adventurers learned that the timepiece had magical powers dedicated to navigation and teleportation, and speculated that it was just one piece of a larger and more potent magic device.": "{@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW|Gildha}对这个装置有一些了解，她称之为{@item timepiece of travel|AI}。6个月前，金獴团契在一个邪恶的冒险团手中发现了这个遗物，他们声称不久前从一个被亡灵困扰的坟墓里拿走了它。经过仔细的检查和研究，金驼队的冒险家们了解到这个计时器具有专门用于导航和传送的神奇力量，并推测它只是一个更大、更有力的魔法装置的一个部件。",
	"During the attack, Gildha saw one of the Golden Mongoose adventurers—a female tiefling paladin occultant named Talanatha Three-Coins—activate the {@item timepiece of travel|AI} and teleport away. For reasons unknown, the timepiece stayed behind (see the \"{@area Level Inappropriate|0bf|x}\" sidebar). Gildha grabbed the relic, but has no idea where Talanatha went.": "在攻击过程中，Gildha看到一个金艋舺的冒险者--一个名叫Talanatha Three-Coins的女铁弗林圣骑士神秘主义者--激活了{@item timepiece of travel|AI}并传送离开。由于未知的原因，计时器被留下来了（见\"{@area Level Inappropriate|0bf|x} \"侧边栏）。吉尔达抓住了这个遗物，但不知道塔拉纳塔去了哪里。",
	"Gildha also tells the characters that she saw some of the attackers heading into a small cellar beneath the manor, consisting of storage areas and a spring-fed cistern. She knows that the manor features subterranean areas more extensive than the cellar, but the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose had yet to do a thorough search of those areas. (As a result, Gildha doesn't know about the secret door that leads to the dungeon.)": "Gildha还告诉角色们，她看到一些袭击者进入了庄园下面的一个小地窖，里面有储藏区和一个有泉水的蓄水池。她知道庄园的地下区域比地窖更广阔，但金驼团契还没有对这些区域进行彻底搜查。(因此，吉尔德哈不知道通往地窖的秘密门）。",
	"Although the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose didn't find the secret door leading into the hidden basement beneath the manor, the agents of the Six did. They then made extensive use of the dungeon before departing. Map 2.2 shows the layout of the dungeons beneath the manor.": "虽然金驼团没有找到通往庄园下面隐藏的地下室的暗门，但六人组的特工却找到了。然后他们在离开之前大量使用了这个地牢。地图2.2显示了庄园下面的地牢的布局。",

	"Most doors in the dungeon are wooden, and are closed and unlocked. If a door is locked, it takes a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools to open it. A locked door can also be smashed open with a successful DC 15 Strength check.": "地牢里的大多数门都是木制的，而且是关着的，也可以不上锁。如果一扇门被锁住了，需要用盗贼的工具成功地进行DC10灵巧检查才能打开它。被锁住的门也可以通过成功的DC15力量检查来砸开。",

	"The pit is 20 feet deep. Operatives of the Six spread shards of broken glass over the bottom of the pit, so that a creature falling in takes 2 ({@dice 1d4}) slashing damage in addition to 7 ({@dice 2d6}) bludgeoning damage from the fall.

The last time any of the others saw the three, they were alive and among the victors.": "如果人物有帕茨基或斯普林特格姐妹问，他们可以报告说，桌子下面的尸体是帮助攻击庄园的抓捕者。其他任何人最后一次看到这三个人时，他们还活着，而且是在胜利者中。",

	"Dran Enterprises keeps a close watch on Acquisitions Incorporated operations. Whenever an Acq Inc franchise fails, Dran Enterprises swoops in to make a hostile takeover of the assets and expand its own operations. The Phandalin franchise is no exception. As soon as Sister Garaele saw the trouble at Tresendar Manor, the priest of Tymora let Dran Enterprises know. Dran Enterprises then dispatched a crew of hobgoblins to evaluate the area, clean up, and take control of Tresendar Manor as quickly as possible. When the adventurers leave the dungeon for the final time, they see that cleanup crew in any area close to the entrance.": "德兰企业密切关注着收购公司的运作。每当Acq公司的特许经营权失败时，德兰企业就会猛然介入，对资产进行恶意收购，扩大自己的业务。范达林的特许经营权也不例外。加莱尔修女一看到特伦达庄园的麻烦，泰莫拉的牧师就立刻让德兰企业知道。德兰企业随即派出一队地痞流氓，对该地区进行评估、清理，并尽快控制了特伦达庄园。当冒险者们最后一次离开地牢时，他们在靠近入口的任何区域看到了那支清理队伍。",
	"As you step through the door, two hobgoblins pause, staring at you with a mix of anger and confusion. One wears an oversized tank on her back with a hand-held hose and nozzle emerging from it. A clear, viscous liquid drips from the nozzle, sizzling and smoking when it hits the ground. The second hobgoblin brandishes a lethal-looking sword. Both wear leather armor branded with the insignia of Dran Enterprises.": "当你跨进门时，两个妖精停了下来，用愤怒和困惑的目光盯着你。其中一个背上背着一个超大的水箱，里面有一个手持的软管和喷嘴冒出来。一种透明的、粘稠的液体从喷嘴中滴出，落地时发出咝咝的烟声。第二个妖精挥舞着一把看起来很致命的剑。两人都穿着烙有德兰企业徽章的皮甲。",
	"These two {@creature Hobgoblin||hobgoblins}—{@creature Grunka|OoW} and Fraht—lead the Dran Enterprises advance crew. They arrived clandestinely just after the characters entered the dungeon, and aren't expecting any resistance given the low-key nature of their cleaning assignment. {@creature Grunka|OoW} wears an acid spray gun, an invention of Dran Enterprises R&D.

	"If questioned, any surviving hobgoblins proudly admit that they work for Dran Enterprises, and that they were hired to clean up the manor site and prepare it for annexation. The hobgoblins claim (truthfully) to know nothing about what happened to reduce the manor to ruins, or the fate of the missing tiefling from the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose.

	"Sure enough, well-known Acquisitions Incorporated operative Viari (see {@book appendix A|AI|3}) arrives the next day to deliver the documents and supplies, and to officially christen the new Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. He has each of the characters sign a contract crammed full of legalese and double-talk. Any character who reads the document and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check can decipher the jargon to learn the following, or Viari can explain the highlights:": "果然，著名的收购公司特工Viari（见{@book appendix A|AI|3}）第二天就来了，送来了文件和物资，并为新的收购公司特许经营权正式洗牌。他让每个角色都签署了一份充满法律术语和双关语的合同。任何读过文件的角色，如果在DC15智力检查中获得成功，就可以破译这些专业术语，了解以下内容，或者维阿利可以解释其中的重点。",

	"\"{@book Franchise Advancement|AI|1|Franchise Advancement}\" in chapter 2 has detailed explanations of all these benefits and more.": "第二章中的\"{@book Franchise Advancement|AI|1|Franchise Advancement} \"详细解释了所有这些好处，以及更多。",
	"One of the franchise's first hires might be right in front of them already. {@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW}, former majordomo for the Company of the Golden Mongoose, is grieving her lost employers and anxious to put her life back together. With previous experience running a franchise (and no fault in that franchise's destruction), she makes an excellent choice for majordomo, and suggests that role for herself if the characters don't ask her. The remaining episodes in this adventure assume that the characters selected {@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW} as their franchise's majordomo. If they chose another NPC to fill that role, simply adjust the text throughout the adventure accordingly.": "特许经营的第一批雇员之一可能已经在他们面前了。{@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW}，前金驼公司的主事人，正在为她失去的雇主感到悲伤，并急于把她的生活重新安排好。她以前有经营特许经营权的经验（而且在特许经营权的破坏中没有过错），她是一个很好的选择，如果角色不要求她的话，她建议自己担任这个角色。在这次冒险中的其余情节中，假设人物选择了{@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW}作为他们的特许经营权的主人公。如果他们选择了另一个NPC来充当这个角色，只需在整个冒险过程中对文本进行相应的调整。",
	"With the contract signed, the ruins of Tresendar Manor become the franchise's starter headquarters! One of the benefits of Head Office negotiating with Harbin Wester for the lease to the manor is that the company can drive a much harder bargain than the characters would ever be able to strike. This beneficial deal might have hidden downsides, though, as the thin profit margins of the lease become a point of ongoing conflict between the characters and the corrupt banker.": "随着合同的签署，特伦达庄园的废墟成为特许经营的启动总部 总公司与哈尔滨维斯特公司就庄园的租约进行谈判的好处之一是，该公司可以比角色们更努力地进行讨价还价。不过，这种有利的交易可能有隐藏的弊端，因为租约的薄利多销成为人物与腐败的银行家之间持续冲突的一个点。",
	"At the signing of the franchise agreement, each character picks one of the positions detailed in \"{@book Company Positions|AI|1|Company Positions}\" in chapter 2. When they do so, Viari hands out any special position gear and instructs the characters in how best to fulfill their roles. Chapter 2 has more details on these positions, the benefits they confer, and what they mean to the franchise. Hopefully, the players have already considered what positions are the best fit for their characters and for the franchise as a whole, but if not, give them time. Make sure it's clear what each position entails and what franchise duties a character with a given position is expected to perform.": "在签署特许经营协议时，每个角色都会选择第二章\"{@book Company Positions|AI|1|Company Positions} \"中详述的一个职位。当他们这样做时，Viari会发放任何特殊的职位装备，并指导人物如何最好地履行他们的角色。第二章有更多关于这些职位的细节，它们所带来的好处，以及它们对特许经营的意义。希望玩家们已经考虑过哪些职位最适合他们的角色和整个特许经营权，但如果没有，请给他们时间。要确保清楚每个职位需要什么，以及拥有特定职位的角色应该履行哪些特许经营职责。",
	"In addition to the characters' positions, the franchise majordomo can also select a company position if desired. This is especially useful if there's a key position that none of the players wants to take, or if the party size is small.": "除了人物的职位外，如果需要的话，特许经营商也可以选择一个公司的职位。如果有一个关键职位没有人愿意担任，或者党员人数不多，这就特别有用。",
	"The process of rebuilding Tresendar Manor will take some time, and as proud franchise owners, the characters need to be around to pitch in and make sure nothing goes awry. At the same time, their newly awarded territory is ripe for exploration and interaction with potential customers and business partners. As the characters take stock of their situation, they can engage in downtime activities and undertake some of the franchise tasks that operate alongside the downtime rules.": "重建特伦达庄园的过程将需要一些时间，作为自豪的特许经营权所有者，这些人物需要在身边投其所好，确保不会出现任何意外。同时，他们新获得的领土已经成熟，可以与潜在的客户和商业伙伴进行探索和互动。随着人物对自己情况的评估，他们可以参与停工活动，并承担一些与停工规则同时运作的特许经营任务。",
	"All the activities mentioned in this section are introduced or talked about in the \"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime}\" section in chapter 2. That section notes which books existing activities can be found in.": "本节中提到的所有活动都在第二章的\"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime} \"部分进行了介绍或谈论。该部分指出了现有活动可以在哪些书中找到。",
	"As the characters spend time establishing their new commercial home turf, the explore territory downtime activity can yield up all kinds of new opportunities and connections. Interesting NPCs might be revealed on a walkabout in the woods around Phandalin, or the characters might locate stands of prime timber or abandoned mines still holding valuable ore. Such resources can become part of the franchise's ongoing revenue stream.": "当人物花时间建立他们新的商业主场时，探索领土的闲暇活动可以产生各种新的机会和联系。有趣的NPC可能会在范达林周围的树林中被发现，或者人物可能会找到优质木材或废弃的矿井，这些矿井仍有宝贵的矿石。这些资源可以成为特许经营权的持续收入来源的一部分。",
	"Commercial connections forged with NPCs could also be formalized and refined. The lizardfolk of the Mere of Dead Men and the Splintfig sisters are just two of the potential business partnerships from this episode, whether the characters engage those NPCs themselves or allocate members of their brand-new staff for those tasks.": "与NPC建立的商业联系也可以被正式化和完善。死人谷的蜥蜴人和Splintfig姐妹只是这一集中的两个潜在的商业伙伴关系，无论人物是自己与这些NPC打交道，还是分配他们全新的员工去完成这些任务。",
	"In Phandalin, the characters might use the marketeering activity to set up a partnership with Linene Graywind at the Lionshield Coster, or with Sharna Quirstiron of the Phandalin Miner's Exchange—whether they know Sharna's true allegiances or not. Depending on how well the characters are getting along with Harbin Wester, the shady business practice activity might let them get more dirt on the banker, or gain his favor by going after some of his rivals.": "在潘达林，角色们可能会利用市场活动与狮盾成本商的Linene Graywind建立合作关系，或者与潘达林矿工交易所的Sharna Quirstiron建立合作关系--无论他们是否知道Sharna的真实忠诚。根据人物与哈尔滨-维斯特相处的情况，这种不光彩的商业行为可能会让他们得到更多关于银行家的污点，或者通过对他的一些竞争对手下手来获得他的青睐。",
	"Shady business practices might be an even bigger part of the characters' plans for their franchise. Any number of dodgy NPCs in town might be interested in partnering with characters who want to skirt the law. Smuggling ore without paying taxes, skimming from the coffers of either temple, running illegal gambling at the Sleeping Giant—any of these activities could net a nice profit with relatively limited risk.": "阴暗的商业行为可能是这些人物的特许经营计划中更重要的一部分。镇上任何一个狡猾的NPC都可能对与那些想规避法律的角色合作感兴趣。走私矿石而不交税，从神庙的库房里偷钱，在沉睡的巨人那里进行非法赌博--这些活动中的任何一个都可以在相对有限的风险下获得丰厚的利润。",
	"If the characters have nobler aspirations for their franchise—or if they're savvy enough to want to hide their franchise's ignoble aspirations from the get-go—a philanthropic enterprise can go a long way toward shoring up the party's reputation. A franchise could work to support the existing charity efforts of either of the local temples, or the characters could create their own fund for out-of-work miners. Doing so makes acquiring ongoing concessions or information from townsfolk much easier, but puts the characters in the bad graces of Sharna Quirstiron at the Miner's Exchange.": "如果人物对他们的特许经营权有更高的追求--或者如果他们足够精明，想从一开始就隐藏他们特许经营权的不光彩的追求--那么慈善事业可以在很大程度上巩固党的声誉。特许经营权可以支持当地寺庙的现有慈善工作，或者这些人物可以为失业的矿工创建自己的基金。这样做可以更容易地从镇民那里获得持续的优惠或信息，但也会使角色们受到矿工交易所的莎尔娜-奎斯特隆的恶感。",
	"Many of the locals had interactions with Talanatha in the three months that the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was around Phandalin, and characters can use the schmoozing or carousing downtime activities to learn more about the tiefling. In particular, a number of the regulars at the Sleeping Giant remember drinking with Talanatha. She often grumbled about whether the Company of the Golden Mongoose was the best fit for her, and talked about a good friend named Wizzy who worked for another Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. The details on Wizzy's franchise are vague, but Talanatha spoke of her friend having \"an awesome headquarters up the coast.\"": "在金驼队在潘达林附近的三个月里，许多当地人都与塔拉纳塔有过交往，角色们可以利用闲暇时间的攀谈或狂欢活动来了解这个铁皮人。特别是，沉睡的巨人的一些常客都记得和塔拉纳塔一起喝酒。她经常埋怨金驼公司是否最适合她，并谈到一个叫威兹的好朋友，他在另一家收购公司的专营店工作。关于Wizzy的特许经营权的细节很模糊，但塔拉纳塔谈到她的朋友在 \"海岸上有一个很棒的总部\"。",
	"Characters can also spend downtime investigating the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} and the {@item timepiece of travel|AI}, using either the scrutineering or research activities. In addition to revealing more details of the orrery as you see fit (see {@book appendix D|AI|6}), such investigation could reveal that the last place the timepiece teleported someone to was a location on the Sea of Swords, north of Neverwinter but south of Luskan. Scrutineering or inquiries through Head Office turns up information on an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise based in that area—the Order of the Stout Half-Pint, which has its headquarters in an old lighthouse along a stretch of coast known locally as Silent Sound.": "角色也可以用停工期来调查{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}和{@item timepiece of travel|AI}，使用检查或研究活动。除了揭示更多你认为合适的钟表细节外（见{@book appendix D|AI|6}），这样的调查可以发现计时器最后传送到的地方是剑海的一个地方，在永冬的北部，但在卢斯坎的南部。通过总部的调查或查询，发现了一个收购公司在该地区的特许经营权的信息--Stout Half-Pint骑士团，其总部设在当地称为Silent Sound的海岸线上的一座旧灯塔里。",
	"Whatever clues the characters obtain regarding Talanatha's likely destination, have those hints play out over the full length of the downtime rather than rushing to advance to the next episode. The players should get used to how big a part downtime and franchise activities play in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.": "无论角色们获得了关于Talanatha可能的目的地的什么线索，都要让这些暗示在整个停工期内发挥出来，而不是急于推进到下一集。玩家应该习惯于在收购公司的活动中，停工期和特许经营活动所占的比重有多大。",
	"Before the next phase of the adventure, make sure the characters have their franchise and business affairs in order. They should know who their franchise employees are, giving those staff members detailed instructions about what to do while the characters are away. This sort of planning is a common theme in any Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, so establish this precedent early.": "在冒险的下一阶段之前，要确保角色们把他们的特许经营权和商业事务安排妥当。他们应该知道谁是他们的特许经营员工，给这些员工以详细的指示，告诉他们在人物不在的时候应该做什么。这种计划是任何收购公司活动的共同主题，所以要尽早建立这种先例。",
	"Speculating that Talanatha Three-Coins might have fled to the Silent Sound lighthouse headquarters of another Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, the characters might attempt to make contact with that franchise, either on their own or through Head Office. However, any such attempts yield no response. At some point, Omin Dran contacts the characters if they don't contact him first. He's worried about what the lack of contact with the Order of the Stout Half-Pint might mean, and he wants the characters to investigate.": "角色们猜测塔拉纳塔-三钱可能已经逃到了另一家收购公司的寂静之声灯塔总部，他们可能会试图与该公司取得联系，无论是自己还是通过总部。然而，任何这样的尝试都没有得到回应。在某些时候，如果他们不先联系Omin Dran，他就会联系这些角色。他很担心与 \"半品脱啤酒团 \"缺乏联系意味着什么，他希望角色们能进行调查。",
	"The presence of Dran Enterprises operatives in Phandalin is troubling for Omin—especially if the Dran Enterprises hobgoblins were killed without the characters questioning them, leading to the assumption that the organization was behind the initial attack. If the characters aren't suitably intrigued by the orrery and its newly discovered component, that can be another thing that Omin charges them with investigating. Armed with a solid guess that Talanatha fled to the lighthouse, the characters prepare to head north!": "德兰企业的特工出现在范达林，这让奥明感到不安--特别是如果德兰企业的霍布林在人物没有询问他们的情况下被杀，就会导致假设该组织是最初袭击的幕后黑手。如果角色们没有适当地对桔梗和它新发现的组件产生兴趣，那就可以成为Omin责成他们调查的另一件事。带着对塔拉纳塔逃往灯塔的可靠猜测，角色们准备向北出发",
	"In this episode, the characters (newly enfranchised and now 3rd level) travel to the Silent Sound lighthouse to search for Talanatha, the tiefling paladin occultant of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose. On the way, Omin Dran contacts them with a request. He wants them to stop in Neverwinter to check on a cache of Acquisitions Incorporated treasure being stored there. However, the doppelganger who hid the cache has been arrested and is about to be executed. Even if the characters save her, retrieving the treasure where it's been hidden in the House of Knowledge—Oghma's temple in Neverwinter—will take more time and effort than Omin predicted.": "在这一集里，角色们（刚被授予权利，现在是3级）前往寂静之音灯塔，寻找金驼团契的铁皮人圣骑士神秘主义者塔拉纳塔。在路上，奥明-德兰联系了他们，提出了一个请求。他希望他们在永夜城停留，检查存放在那里的收购公司的宝藏。然而，藏匿宝藏的二重身已被逮捕，即将被处决。即使角色们救了她，要找回藏在知识之家--奥格玛在永冬的寺庙里的宝藏，也要比奥明预想的花费更多的时间和精力。",
	"Leaving Neverwinter, the characters head north in the direction of Silent Sound. But even as the lighthouse comes into view, they spot a small boat under attack by creatures from the deep. If they rescue the crew, the characters might find a business opportunity that involves partaking in a little mutiny against a ruthless captain.": "离开永无止境，人物向北朝寂静湾的方向走去。但就在灯塔出现的时候，他们发现一艘小船受到了来自深海的生物的攻击。如果他们能救出船员，人物可能会发现一个商机，那就是参与对抗无情的船长的小叛乱。",
	"At the lighthouse, the characters confirm that the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise headquartered there—the Order of the Stout Half-Pint—was attacked, and that most of its members have been killed. Moving up through the different levels of the lighthouse tower, the franchisees find more and more evidence that the same spellcaster whose creations they've previously faced has wrought havoc there. That spellcaster, Hoobur Gran'Shoop, is found working in a grisly laboratory beneath the tower, to which the adventurers gain entrance through the lighthouse's magic lens. That laboratory is only part of the lighthouse's secret basement, though, and the characters engage in some dangerous and lucrative dungeoneering after dealing with—or doing a deal with—Hoobur.": "在灯塔上，这些人物确认总部设在那里的收购公司的特许经营权--坚固的半品脱骑士团--受到了攻击，而且其大部分成员都被杀害了。通过灯塔的不同楼层，加盟商们发现越来越多的证据表明，他们之前面对的那个施法者在这里造成了巨大的破坏。这个施法者名叫胡伯-格兰肖普（Hoobur Gran'Shoop），被发现在塔下的一个可怕的实验室里工作，冒险者们通过灯塔的魔镜进入了这个实验室。不过，这个实验室只是灯塔秘密地下室的一部分，在与胡伯打交道或与胡伯做交易后，角色们参与了一些危险而有利可图的地下活动。",
	"With the threats in the lighthouse dispensed with, the characters learn that its franchise members had also recently collected one of the clockwork components of the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}. They also have evidence in hand pointing to the involvement of Dran Enterprises in the attack on the lighthouse, building on the sighting of Dran Enterprises operatives in Phandalin. But what does Dran Enterprises want with the orrery? And which band of plucky franchisees will be tasked with finding out?": "随着灯塔中的威胁被消除，角色们了解到其特许经营成员最近也收集了{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}的一个发条部件。他们还掌握了证据，表明德兰企业参与了对灯塔的袭击，这是在范达林看到德兰企业人员的基础上形成的。但是，德兰企业想要什么？哪一队勇敢的加盟者将负责找出答案？",
	"With the franchise headquarters in Phandalin secured and the rebuilding of Tresendar Manor underway, the adventurers have a clear path ahead of them to the Silent Sound lighthouse. However, you get to decide how complicated the journey turns out to be.": "随着位于范达林的特许经营总部的安全和特伦达庄园的重建工作的进行，冒险家们有了一条通往寂静之音灯塔的明确道路。然而，你可以决定这段旅程会有多复杂。",
	"Before the characters leave for the lighthouse, or while they are on the High Road traveling toward Neverwinter, Omin Dran makes contact with a \"small favor.\" Neverwinter is located on the High Road on the way to the Silent Sound lighthouse, so is an easy stop for the party to make.": "在人物出发去灯塔之前，或者当他们在前往永夜城的大路上时，奥明-德兰联系到了一个 \"小忙\"。永温特位于通往寂静之音灯塔的公路上，所以对他们来说是一个很容易到达的地方。",
	"Head Office assignments of this sort can become common in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, especially as the characters' reputation as troubleshooters grows. You can use such side treks as useful support for a franchise's main mission, or as an inconvenient interruption.": "在收购公司的活动中，这种总部的任务很常见，特别是当角色作为麻烦解决者的声誉越来越高时。你可以把这种副业作为对特许经营的主要任务的有益支持，或者作为一种不方便的干扰。",
	"{@creature Omin Dran|AI} contacts the characters via the franchise documancer's {@item documancy satchel|AI} or some other form of magic.

	"\"Yeah, so I'm going to need you to do a little extra work for me. It shouldn't be too taxing. I have a contact in Neverwinter who's secured a cache of treasure. Her name is Oppal DeScart, and you can usually find her in a tavern in the Blacklake District known as the Stable Quiver. She's a shapeshifter, so I can't say for sure what she'll look like when you locate her. You can suss her out with the passphrase \"That's a big hen house,\" and she should reply with \"Only to a small fox.\" When you locate her, tell her that it's safe to \"Move the cargo along the Platinum Road.\" And that's it. She'll give you the treasure to get out of Neverwinter safely. The whole affair should take a few hours, and then you can be on your way. You can get the goods to me when you return.\"": "\"是的，所以我需要你为我做一点额外的工作。这应该不会太累人。我在永夜城有一个联系人，他获得了一批宝藏。她的名字叫Oppal DeScart，你通常可以在黑湖区的一家名为Stable Quiver的酒馆中找到她。她是个变身人，所以我不能确定你找到她时她会是什么样子。你可以用 \"那是个大鸡舍 \"来打探她，她应该回答 \"只对小狐狸\"。当你找到她时，告诉她，\"沿着白金路移动货物 \"是安全的。就这样了。她会给你宝藏，让你安全离开永夜城。整个事件应该只需要几个小时，然后你就可以上路了。你回来后可以把货物交给我。\"",
	"Omin's primary concern is to have Oppal's treasure secured and removed from the city without drawing the attention of Neverwinter's tax collectors. He tells the characters that the treasure is small but its container is warded, and that they should be prepared to store and carry it without looking in it. Omin isn't keen to get into additional details, though, suggesting that the less the characters know, the better.

But if they tarry for no particular reason, Menard is dragged into the water, never to surface again. A similar period later, a tentacle pulls Chalkie into the drink. Belle then perishes if the characters ignore the fight completely.": "三个{@creature Giant Octopus||giant octopuses}正在攻击一艘{@vehicle Longship||longboat}及其船员--Belle Mare、Menard Chatte和Chalkie Sharke（都是CG人类{@creature Bandit||bandits}）。根据他们的旅行方式，将战斗调整到人物到达现场所需的时间长度。但如果他们没有特别的原因而耽搁，梅纳德就会被拖入水中，再也无法浮出水面。同样的时间，一个触手将查基拉入水中。如果角色们完全不理会这场战斗，那么贝勒就会灭亡。",
	"If the characters intercede, the sailors fight alongside them until the octopuses are driven away, or the characters convince the sailors to flee to safety.": "如果人物出面调停，水手们就会与他们并肩作战，直到章鱼被赶走，或者人物说服水手们逃到安全地带。",
	"Friedson is a Northlander who has pushed his crew to more and more dangerous and despicable deeds in recent months. He has even talked about taking up full-on piracy and slave trading to earn extra coin, and the (mostly) good souls aboard the {@i Tortured Tortle} are looking for a new way to make a living. However, Captain Athgar and his new associate, a cleric of Umberlee called Sister Foam, have threatened to kill any crew members \"not brave enough\" to take on these new and terrible pursuits.": "弗里德森是一个北地人，最近几个月，他把他的船员推向了越来越危险和卑劣的行为。他甚至谈到要全面从事海盗和奴隶贸易以赚取额外的钱财，而{@i Tortured Tortle}船上的(大部分)善良的灵魂正在寻找新的谋生方式。然而，阿斯加船长和他的新伙伴，一位名叫 \"泡沫修女 \"的恩贝里教士，威胁要杀死任何 \"不够勇敢 \"来从事这些新的和可怕的追求的船员。",
	"Regardless of the characters' decision, Belle also reveals that she knows something is wrong at the Silent Sound lighthouse. For at least two tendays, the normally reliable light has been dark. She fears that some sort of magic is in play, because it isn't just the case that the light is out. Rather, it appears to radiate some kind of dark energy. Moreover, she's heard that sightings of spectral figures and will-o'-wisps in the area are on the rise.": "不管人物的决定如何，贝儿还透露，她知道寂静湾灯塔出了问题。至少有两个工作日，通常可靠的灯光一直是黑暗的。她担心是某种魔法在作祟，因为这不仅仅是灯光熄灭的情况。相反，它似乎放射出某种黑暗的能量。此外，她听说在这一地区看到的幽灵般的人物和巫师的数量在增加。",
	"In the end, the sailors must return to their ship or risk the captain's wrath against their friends. The characters are left to explore the lighthouse on their own.": "最后，水手们必须回到自己的船上，否则就要冒着被船长怒斥的危险去找他们的朋友。角色们只能靠自己去探索灯塔。",
	"The smugglers came ashore to retrieve several bolts of rare Calimshan silk to take to an interested buyer in the Moonshae Isles. The five bolts are worth 100 gp each. The characters might find this loot in a nearby sea cave, along with lots of mundane supplies, if all the smugglers perish. Otherwise, Belle recovers the silk before going back to the {@i Tortured Tortle}, but offers the characters 30 gp from her own purse in thanks for their help.": "走私者上岸是为了取回几根稀有的卡林山丝绸，准备带去给摩恩沙群岛的一个感兴趣的买家。这五根丝线每根价值100金币。如果所有的走私者都死了，角色们可能会在附近的一个海洞里找到这些战利品，还有很多普通的物资。否则，贝勒在回到{@i Tortured Tortle}之前收回了丝绸，但为了感谢他们的帮助，她从自己的钱包里拿出了30GP。",
	"The trip back to the {@i Tortured Tortle} is smooth, and the {@vehicle Longship||longboat} sails into position to be hoisted aboard. Belle yells to the watch that she has new crew to bring aboard, and the watch acknowledges the request. This exchange brings the captain—a tall and muscular Northlander—onto the deck. Standing at his side is a short, stocky human female wearing a holy symbol of Umberlee around her neck.": "回到{@i Tortured Tortle}号的旅程很顺利，{@vehicle Longship||longboat}号驶入位置，被吊上船。贝勒向值班人员喊道，她有新的船员要上船，值班人员承认了这个请求。这场交流使船长--一个高大、肌肉发达的北地人--来到了甲板上。站在他身边的是一个矮胖的人类女性，她的脖子上戴着Umberlee的神圣标志。",
	"As the battle continues, you can decide how the rest of the combat goes with regards to additional help. If the characters are winning handily, a few loyalists might escape the general melee and fight beside Captain Athgar. If the characters fare poorly, Belle or other mutineers could intervene to relieve some of the pressure.": "随着战斗的继续，你可以决定剩下的战斗如何进行，以获得额外的帮助。如果角色们赢得很轻松，一些忠诚的人可能会逃离一般的混战，在阿斯加船长身边战斗。如果角色表现不佳，贝勒或其他叛变者可以介入以减轻一些压力。",
	"A lot of people think of piracy as a dead-end job or a last-resort career. This is remarkably shortsighted, as the gig has a startling number of upsides. For example, it's a job that allows you to wear a lot of scarves and sashes. That's rare. What's more, you're never more than two steps from some sort of convenient rope that you can cut and use to dramatically swing into danger.What's more, people don't realize that profit-sharing arrangements are surprisingly common, and there are great opportunities for internal promotion of the dead-sailor's-boots variety. Also? There are a lot of dead sailor's boots, and the resale on those can be very high. Good boots are scarce.": "很多人认为盗版是一份无前途的工作，或者是一份最后的职业。这显然是短视的，因为这份工作有许多令人吃惊的好处。例如，这是一份允许你戴很多围巾和腰带的工作。这很难得。更重要的是，你离某种方便的绳子永远不会超过两步之遥，你可以剪断绳子，用来大幅度地摇摆到危险中。更重要的是，人们没有意识到，利润分享安排是惊人的普遍，而且有很好的机会进行死水手的各种内部晋升。另外，有很多死水手的靴子，这些靴子的转售率可以很高。好的靴子是稀缺的。",
	"Silent Sound lighthouse is a seventy-foot-tall cylindrical tower of mortared stone, with a square base carved into the rock it stands on. The lantern room is enclosed within glass walls and features an open-air catwalk. Map 3.1 shows the layout of the lighthouse tower, which is reached by way of a twisting but safe path leading up from the beach behind it.": "寂静湾灯塔是一座七十英尺高的圆柱形石塔，其上的岩石上刻有一个方形底座。灯塔室被封闭在玻璃墙内，并设有一个露天的猫道。地图3.1显示了灯塔的布局，通过一条曲折但安全的小路，从灯塔后面的海滩上去。",
	"The Order of the Stout Half-Pint had been using the lighthouse as its headquarters for two years before that franchise suffered a fate similar to the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose. It was six months ago that the order came into possession of a piece of the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} called the {@item rotor of return|AI}, and just over a month ago that their search for lore on the rotor came to the attention of the Six. The Six's attack on the lighthouse actually preceded the attack on Phandalin by a few days, and was similarly headed by archmage Hoobur Gran'Shoop. (As a successful franchise, the Order of the Stout Half-Pint has some slack with Head Office, so that their last missed franchise payment didn't draw the same immediate attention as the missed payment from the Phandalin franchise.)": "在该专营权遭遇与金驼团类似的命运之前，坚固半品脱骑士团已将灯塔作为其总部使用了两年。就在六个月前，骑士团掌握了一块名为{@item rotor of return|AI}的{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}，而就在一个多月前，他们对转轮上的传说的搜索引起了六人帮的注意。六人帮对灯塔的攻击实际上比对范达林的攻击早了几天，而且同样是由大法师胡伯-格兰肖普领导的。 (作为一个成功的特许经营机构，\"烈性半品脱 \"骑士团对总部有一些懈怠，所以他们上次错过的特许经营权付款并没有像范达林特许经营权错过的付款那样立即引起注意。)",
	"As with the {@item timepiece of travel|AI}, Hoobur has so far failed to find the {@item rotor of return|AI}, but he doesn't mind. He has claimed the lighthouse since returning here from Phandalin, finding the basement laboratory to be a perfect place for his experiments. Even as he works for the Six, Hoobur continues to make it look as if he works for Dran Enterprises. The leadership of the Six expects that attacks on two Acquisitions Incorporated franchises will attract the attention of Acq Inc Head Office, and {@creature Splugoth the Returned|AI} wants that attention directed elsewhere while his plan to claim the orrery comes together.": "和{@item timepiece of travel|AI}一样，胡伯至今也没能找到{@item rotor of return|AI}，但他并不在意。自从从范达林回到这里后，他就认领了这座灯塔，发现地下室的实验室是他进行实验的最佳场所。即使他为六人帮工作，胡伯也继续让人觉得他为德兰企业工作。六人帮的领导层预计，对两家收购公司特许经营权的攻击会引起收购公司总部的注意，{@creature Splugoth the Returned|AI}希望在他认领灯塔的计划出台时，把注意力转移到其他地方。",
	"Perhaps the ship is in sad shape after years of neglect. Can the characters spare 1,000 gp (a tenth of the sailing ship's worth) for repairs? And what happens if the ship gets into trouble and the characters are constantly called upon to rescue the crew and protect their investment?": "也许，这艘船经过多年的忽视，已经破败不堪。角色们能拿出1,000戈比（帆船价值的十分之一）进行维修吗？如果这艘船遇到了麻烦，而人物又不断地被要求去拯救船员和保护他们的投资，会发生什么？",
	"Authorities across the Sword Coast might also want to arrest the crew for Captain Athgar's misdeeds. If any crew members are caught, the authorities might learn about the ship's business relationship with the franchise, creating potential trouble for the characters.": "整个剑海岸的当局可能也想因为阿斯加船长的不轨行为而逮捕船员。如果有船员被抓，当局可能会了解这艘船与专营权的商业关系，给人物带来潜在的麻烦。",
	"On the beach behind the lighthouse, three large tents are set up as temporary lodgings. The members of the Order of the Stout Half-Pint and their staff were living here while preparing the lighthouse for a new round of franchise renovations. Evidence of a fight from many days ago is spread across the grounds, including slashed canvas and broken weapons. Mundane furniture and gear fills the tents, along with kegs of ale, casks of fresh water, boxes of rations, and bundles of arrows. All the tents feature the Dran Enterprises logo scrawled onto them in chalk.": "在灯塔后面的海滩上，有三顶大帐篷作为临时住所。斯托特半品脱骑士团的成员和他们的工作人员住在这里，同时为灯塔进行新一轮的特许经营改造做准备。许多天前的打斗证据散布在院子里，包括被割破的帆布和破碎的武器。平凡的家具和装备摆满了帐篷，还有一桶桶麦酒、一桶桶淡水、一箱箱口粮和一捆捆箭矢。所有的帐篷上都用粉笔写着德兰企业的标志。",
	"The lighthouse is old, and the Order of the Stout Half-Pint has been undertaking recurring renovations since they moved in two years ago. Except where otherwise noted, all areas of the lighthouse have the following features.": "这座灯塔很旧了，自两年前搬进来后，斯特尔特半品脱骑士团一直在进行经常性的修缮。除非另有说明，灯塔的所有区域都有以下特点。",
	"Ceilings are 15 feet high and flat.": "天花板有15英尺高，而且是平的。",
	"The lighthouse is mostly dark. Two lanterns full of oil hang within each level on the east and west walls. Window slits stand 3 feet above the floor on each level, at the center of the north and south walls. These slits are 3 feet high but only a few inches wide, so they're too small to allow passage or let much more than a little dim light in.": "灯塔大部分时间是黑暗的。在东西两面墙上的每一层内都挂着两个装满油的灯笼。每层的窗户缝隙高出地面3英尺，位于南北墙的中心。这些缝隙有3英尺高，但只有几英寸宽，所以它们太小了，不能让人通过，也不能让一点微弱的光线进入。",
	"The door leading into the ground floor at the base of the lighthouse is both locked and trapped.": "通往灯塔底部底层的门既被锁住，又被困住。",
	"A successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check notices that the lock of the stone door is connected to wires that run into the tower's stone walls. This custom-built franchise defense system is rigged to release a rain of arrows from turrets up higher on the lighthouse. The trap can be bypassed by pressing a hidden button on the door, requiring a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to find. Or it can be disarmed with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. If the check to disarm fails by 5 or more, the trap is triggered.": "成功通过DC15智慧({@skill Perception})检查，可以注意到石门的锁与贯穿塔内石壁的电线相连。这个定制的特许经营防御系统被设置为从灯塔上更高的炮塔释放箭雨。这个陷阱可以通过按下门上的一个隐藏按钮来绕过，需要成功通过DC15智力（{@skill Investigation}）检查才能找到。或者可以用盗贼的工具，通过成功的DC15灵巧检查来解除它。如果解除武装的检定失败了5次或更多，陷阱就被触发了。",
	"If the trap is activated, each creature within 10 feet of the door must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 ({@dice 6d6}) piercing damage from the rain of arrows on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The trap does not reset itself automatically, but it will be restocked with arrows and reset manually by Hoobur Gran'Shoop's undead minions if the characters are away from the lighthouse for more than a few hours.": "如果陷阱被激活，门外10英尺范围内的每个生物都必须做一个DC15的灵巧救赎，如果救赎失败，将受到21({@dice 6d6})的箭雨穿刺伤害，如果成功，将受到一半的伤害。陷阱不会自动重置，但如果角色离开灯塔超过几个小时，它就会被胡伯-格兰肖普的亡灵爪牙重新装上箭矢并手动重置。",
	"Once the trap is disabled or triggered, the lock on the door can be picked with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The sturdy stone door can also be smashed open with a successful DC 20 Strength check, or it can be battered down (AC 13, 50 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage).": "一旦陷阱失效或被触发，门上的锁可以用盗贼的工具通过DC10的灵巧检查来撬开。坚固的石门也可以用成功的DC20力量检查砸开，或者可以把它打倒（AC13，50点命中，对毒药和精神伤害免疫）。",
	"When the characters gain access to the ground floor, they can see what's inside.": "当人物进入一楼时，他们可以看到里面的东西。",
	"In the center of this square room carved into the base of the promontory, a circular staircase spirals upward. The area has been emptied of furniture, but a number of parchments and maps are tacked onto the walls. The corpse of a halfling is sprawled beneath one of those maps. It isn't moving. However, the spectral halfling hanging motionless in the air above it is very much in motion as it drifts toward you, moaning.": "在这个刻在海角底部的方形房间中央，一个圆形的楼梯盘旋而上。这里的家具已经被清空，但墙上贴着一些羊皮纸和地图。一具半身人的尸体就躺在其中一张地图的下面。它没有动。然而，悬挂在它上方空中一动不动的半身人幽灵却很有活力，它向你飘来，发出呻吟。",
	"The ghost and the corpse are all that remain of a deceased member of the Order of the Stout Half-Pint, Patsy McRoyne. An examination of the body reveals no weapon wounds, but a successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) or Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check finds evidence of necrotic damage. A familiar sigil has been carved into the corpse's chest—a draconic skull pierced by a sword thrust upward through it.": "幽灵和尸体是烈性半品脱骑士团成员帕特西-麦克罗恩的全部遗物。对尸体的检查没有发现武器的伤痕，但如果成功地进行DC10智力({@skill Arcana})或智慧({@skill Medicine})检查，可以发现坏死的证据。尸体的胸口被刻上了一个熟悉的符号--被一把剑向上刺穿的龙人头骨。",

	"A wall calendar with the name \"Wizzy\" on it records adventures the order has undertaken.

	"The next floor is circular, as the square base cut into the promontory gives way to the upper levels of the tower. The stairway continues its upward spiral from this floor to another.

	"As you step from the stairs into the single room of this floor, a snarling and growling greets you. On opposite sides of this room stand two vicious-looking hounds with black fur. The creatures smell of sulfur and rot, and both wear ornate collars of silvery metal. Each stands within a square scribed onto the floor, ten feet on a side and edged with runes. The rune-marked boundaries appear to push the creatures back as they try in vain to cross through.": "当你从楼梯步入这层楼的单人房间时，一阵咆哮声迎面而来。在这个房间的两边，站着两只长着黑色皮毛的凶恶的猎犬。这两只动物散发着硫磺和腐烂的气味，都戴着银色金属的华丽项圈。每个人都站在一个刻在地板上的正方形内，边上有十英尺，边缘有符文。当这些生物徒劳地试图穿越时，符文标记的边界似乎将它们推回。",
	"Two {@creature Hell Hound||hell hounds} are presently held within magical wards in this area. Hoobur summoned these fiends but has yet to assign them a task, so he keeps them \"crated\" here.

Unless the hell hounds are first destroyed, the only way to safely climb the stairs is to disarm the runes with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. Failure by 5 or more triggers the runes, releasing the hell hounds. {@spell Dispel magic} can remove the runes from one stair.": "一个知道符文并成功通过DC15智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查的角色会发现，任何踏上被困楼梯的人都会将地狱猎犬从警戒区域释放出来。除非地狱猎犬首先被消灭，否则安全爬上楼梯的唯一方法是通过DC15智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查成功解除符文。失败5次以上会触发符文，释放出地狱猎犬。{@spell Dispel magic}可以移除一个楼梯上的符文。",

	"The original builder of the lighthouse was a kindly old wizard who enjoyed the romantic idea of living rustic by the sea in his final years. He wanted a laboratory inaccessible to the prying eyes and wandering feet of normal folk. He therefore created the magic lens that allowed him to teleport directly from the top of the lighthouse to his underground workshop.": "灯塔的最初建造者是一位善良的老巫师，他喜欢在最后的岁月里在海边过着质朴的生活的浪漫想法。他希望有一个实验室，让普通人的窥视和游荡的脚步无法进入。因此，他创造了魔法透镜，使他能够直接从灯塔的顶部传送到他的地下工作室。",
	"When the Order of the Stout Half-Pint took over the abandoned lighthouse two years ago, Wizzy quickly discovered the teleporting power of the lens. However, renovating the disused basement laboratory had long remained just another item on the franchise's to-do list, and no one ever discovered the super-secret basement beyond.": "两年前，当斯道特半品脱骑士团接管了这座废弃的灯塔时，威兹很快发现了透镜的传送能力。然而，翻新废弃的地下室实验室长期以来一直只是特许经营名单上的另一个项目，没有人发现地下室以外的超级秘密。",
	"After Hoobur Gran'Shoop led his undead minions in the attack on the lighthouse, the gnome archmage used the teleporting lens to inspect the secret basement laboratory, and soon discovered the super-secret basement beyond. Though he didn't explore the super-secret basement, he was delighted to find that most of the equipment he needed to do his work (minus the victims) was already set up for him in the lab. The place was even dark and dreary, just the way he liked it. Not wanting to pass up an incredible opportunity, the archmage decided to make the Silent Sound lighthouse his new home.": "在胡伯-格兰肖普率领他的亡灵爪牙攻击灯塔后，地精大法师用传送镜检查了地下室的秘密实验室，并很快发现了地下室之外的超级秘密。虽然他没有探索这个超级机密的地下室，但他很高兴地发现，他工作所需的大部分设备（除去受害者）都已经在实验室里为他准备好了。这个地方甚至是黑暗和沉闷的，正是他喜欢的方式。大法师不想放弃一个不可思议的机会，他决定把静音灯塔作为他的新家。",
	"During his attack on the lighthouse, Hoobur made sure that his troops captured rather than killed Wizzy Fotz, the gnome leader of the Order of the Stout Half-Pint. When the tiefling Talanatha appeared out of nowhere in her flight from the attack on Tresendar Manor, Hoobur's minions took her alive as well. He later brought these two prisoners to his lab and has been performing magical rites on them, draining their vitality and will to keep them in a state between life and death.": "在进攻灯塔的过程中，胡伯尔确保他的部队抓到了而不是杀死了威兹-福茨，他是粗粮半品脱骑士团的地精领袖。当铁皮人塔拉纳塔在逃离对特伦达庄园的攻击时突然出现，胡伯的部下也把她活捉了。后来他把这两个囚犯带到了他的实验室，一直在对他们进行魔法仪式，耗尽他们的生命力和意志，使他们处于生死之间。",

An iron cage is set against one wall, its door open.": "当你踏入镜头时，一道刺眼的闪光在你的大脑中留下了不可磨灭的印记。当你的视线清晰时，你发现自己在一个充满实验室和奥术设备的石室的角落里。高大的书柜里装满了书籍，在两面墙上排列着，而其他墙上则摆放着长长的桌子，上面布满了酒杯、烧瓶、大锅、烧杯，以及装着奇怪试剂和成分的容器。一个铁笼子靠着一面墙，笼子的门开着。",

His instructions were to make it look like Dran Enterprises was responsible.

	"The {@creature mechachimera|OoW} moves to place itself between the characters and the prisoner. It uses the stat block of a {@creature chimera} with these changes:": "{@creature mechachimera|OoW}移动到人物和囚犯之间。它使用{@creature chimera}的状态块，并有这些变化。",
	"It is a construct.": "它是一种构造。",
	"It has immunity to poison and psychic damage.": "它对毒药和精神伤害有免疫力。",
	"Screve held a {@creature pentadrone} from Mechanus as his prisoner in this area, using the modron as a model for the constructs he was creating. The pentadrone, known as 57EV1E (or \"Stevie\" to its friends), has been disconnected from the axiomatic mind of Primus, making it a rogue modron. (See the \"Variant: Rogue Modrons\" sidebar in the modron section of the {@book Monster Manual|MM}.) It wants to go back to Mechanus and reestablish its link with the rest of its kind.": "斯克雷夫在这个区域关押了一个来自麦坎纳斯的{@creature pentadrone}作为他的囚犯，用这个莫德隆作为他正在创造的构造物的模型。这个被称为57EV1E（对它的朋友来说就是 \"史蒂夫\"）的五角龙已经与普利姆斯的公理心断开了联系，使它成为一个流氓模子。(见 \"变体。流氓莫德隆 \"侧边栏中的莫德隆{@book Monster Manual|MM}。它想回到麦加努斯，重新建立与其他同类的联系。",
	"Stevie is willing and able to help the characters, but it must be freed from the padlocked chains that restrain it. One locked chain secures each of the modron's five arms. A successful DC 13 Dexterity check using thieves' tools opens one lock and removes the attached chain. The chains can also be severed (AC 10, 15 hit points, immune to poison and psychic damage) or broken with a successful DC 20 Strength check. The manner in which Stevie is tightly bound prevents the modron from attacking or trying to break the chains.": "史迪威愿意并能够帮助这些人物，但它必须从限制它的挂锁链条中解脱出来。莫德隆的五条手臂上各有一条锁链。使用盗贼工具，成功地进行DC13灵巧检查，就可以打开一个锁，并取下连接的链条。链子也可以被切断（AC10，15点命中率，对毒药和精神伤害免疫），或者通过成功的DC20力量检查来打破。斯蒂文被紧紧捆住的方式使莫德隆无法攻击或试图挣脱锁链。",
	"The {@creature mechachimera|OoW} falls apart when destroyed, revealing five large platinum rods worth 100 gp each, as well as its three charged disks. In addition, characters poking through the construct's remains can spot two magic items that were part of its components—a {@item sentinel shield} and a {@item Quaal's Feather Token, Anchor||Quaal's feather token (anchor)}.": "这个{@creature mechachimera|OoW}被摧毁后会散开，露出五个大的铂金棒，每个价值100金币，以及它的三个带电盘。此外，探查该建筑残骸的人可以发现两件属于其组成部分的魔法物品--一个（1%）和一个（2%）。",
	"If the characters release Stevie, the modron is grateful for the rescue and happy to share its story. The construct relates the story of how it had been sent to the Material Plane to recover a rogue modron that was spreading chaos, but was captured by Screve. The wizard held the pentadrone prisoner and used it as a model to create replica modrons. (If none of the characters speaks Modron or has some alternative means of communication with the construct, Stevie picked up enough Common from Screve during its years of imprisonment to get by.)": "如果角色们释放了史提夫，莫德隆就会感谢他们的救援，并乐意分享它的故事。这个构造物讲述了它是如何被派往物质界去找回一个正在散播混乱的流氓莫德隆的，但却被史蒂夫抓住了。巫师囚禁了五角龙，并将其作为模型来创造复制的莫德隆。(如果没有一个角色会说莫德隆语，或者有一些其他的交流方式，那么史蒂夫在被囚禁的几年里从斯蒂夫那里学到了足够的普通话，可以应付自如）。",
	"Stevie isn't sure how long it has been separated from the mind of Primus, but it wants desperately to return to Mechanus. You can decide whether the characters can help Stevie with this plight as a side trek or a downtime activity. Alternatively, the modron might have been disconnected from Primus for too long, keeping it a rogue modron that might become a recurring villain or allied NPC.": "史迪威不知道自己与普利姆斯的思想分离了多久，但它迫切地想回到麦格纳斯。你可以决定角色们是否可以帮助斯蒂文解决这个困境，作为副业的跋涉或停机活动。另外，莫德隆可能已经与普利姆斯断绝联系太久了，让它成为一个流氓莫德隆，可能会成为一个反复出现的反派或同盟NPC。",
	"After dealing with the threats at Silent Sound lighthouse, the characters attain 4th level! They can take stock of whatever treasure they salvaged from the lighthouse and what information they learned within, then figure out their next move.": "在处理完寂静之声灯塔的威胁后，角色们达到了四级！他们可以评估从灯塔中打捞出的宝物和在里面学到的信息。他们可以总结一下从灯塔里打捞出来的任何财宝，以及在里面学到的信息，然后想出下一步的行动。",
	"If the characters didn't find the {@item rotor of return|AI} when exploring the lighthouse, Wizzy can reveal where the relic is hidden if he survived. He is happy to give it to the characters as thanks for their rescue. Alternatively, if Talanatha survived, she knows that Hoobur Gran'Shoop spoke of not finding the rotor, and can join the characters in another search of the lighthouse.": "如果人物在探索灯塔时没有找到{@item rotor of return|AI}，如果Wizzy幸存下来，他可以透露遗物藏在哪里。他很乐意把它送给人物，以感谢他们的救援。另外，如果塔拉纳塔幸存下来，她知道胡伯-格兰肖普说过没有找到转子，她可以和角色们一起再次搜索灯塔。",
	"Assuming that the tiefling Talanatha is rescued, she is both grateful and beholden to the characters. She can fill in any information regarding what happened in Phandalin if the characters have overlooked something, as she can with what the Company of the Golden Mongoose had learned about the orrery.": "假设铁皮人Talanatha被救出来，她对角色既感激又感激。如果角色们忽略了什么，她可以补上任何关于在潘达林发生的事情的信息，就像她可以补上金驼公司了解到的关于兽栏的信息一样。",
	"If the characters recovered Omin's diamonds, they need to return the goods. It's up to you whether they have to make a side trek to Waterdeep for delivery, or if Omin sends a courier to retrieve the stones. If the characters lost the jewels, the consequences could be financially dire.": "如果角色找回了奥明的钻石，他们需要归还货物。至于他们是要到沃特德普（Waterdeep）去送货，还是奥明派快递员去取回钻石，这取决于你的决定。如果人物丢失了宝石，后果可能是经济上的严重损失。",
	"With the {@item rotor of return|AI} in their possession, the characters can undertake additional research into that component and the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} as a whole. See {@book appendix D|AI|6} for information on the rotor, which can be revealed as you determine.": "有了{@item rotor of return|AI}，人物可以对该部件和整个{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}进行额外的研究。关于转子的信息，请看{@book appendix D|AI|6}，可以根据自己的判断来揭示。",
	"The most important piece of information the characters take away from this episode is the \"evidence\" that Dran Enterprises was involved with the attacks on both Acquisitions Incorporated franchises, back in Phandalin and at the lighthouse. The rumor that Dran Enterprises has a secret headquarters in Luskan can be repeated by both Wizzy and Talanatha, setting the stage for the next episode. If the characters need further prodding to think about heading for Luskan, you could also have the orrery housing provide a mental hint that at least one more of its components has recently been sensed north of the lighthouse, and relatively close.": "角色们从这一集带走的最重要的信息是 \"证据\"，即德兰企业参与了对收购公司两家专营店的攻击，回到范达林和在灯塔。关于德兰企业在卢斯坎有一个秘密总部的传言可以由威兹和塔拉纳塔重复，为下一集埋下伏笔。如果角色们需要进一步促使他们考虑前往卢斯坎，你也可以让箭塔的外壳提供一个心理暗示，即最近在灯塔以北至少又感应到了它的一个部件，而且相对较近。",
	"All the activities mentioned in this section are introduced or talked about in the \"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime}\" section in chapter 2.": "本节中提到的所有活动都在第二章的\"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime} \"部分进行了介绍或谈论。",
	"Making use of scrutineering, research, carousing, or schmoozing during downtime can all yield up hints confirming that Dran Enterprises has a secret headquarters in the city of Luskan—and adding rumors suggesting that the organization has recently been engaging in conduct even more secretive than usual. Such activities can also preview some of the information on Luskan presented in {@adventure episode 4|OoW|4}.": "闲暇时利用仔细检查、研究、狂欢或闲聊，都可以得到一些暗示，证实德兰企业在卢斯坎市有一个秘密总部，并增加一些谣言，表明该组织最近从事的行为比平时更加隐秘。这些活动也可以预示着{@adventure episode 4|OoW|4}中提出的一些关于卢斯坎的信息。",
	"The {@creature pentadrone} Stevie wants to travel back to Mechanus, and the characters could assist by using downtime or franchise tasks to make that happen. Research or schmoozing might gain information from knowledgeable sages regarding existing portals to Mechanus, or unique rituals that can open a temporary portal.": "{@creature pentadrone}史蒂文想回到麦金努斯，角色们可以通过利用停工期或特许任务来协助实现这一目标。研究或讨价还价可能会从知识渊博的圣人那里获得关于现有的通往机械城的门户的信息，或者可以打开临时门户的独特仪式。",
	"A character trained in {@skill Arcana} can study the {@creature Mechachimera|OoW|mechachimera's} design if its components are laboriously collected and taken from the basement. Over time, a similar construct could be used as an offensive upgrade to the franchise's headquarters, either as part of future franchise advancement or with the headquarters modification franchise task.": "如果费力地收集并从地下室取出其部件，一个在{@skill Arcana}方面受过训练的角色可以研究{@creature Mechachimera|OoW|mechachimera's}的设计。随着时间的推移，类似的构造可以作为特许经营总部的进攻性升级，作为未来特许经营推进的一部分，或者与总部改造特许经营任务一起。",
	"Having a small castle estate in Phandalin is cool. But having a lighthouse on the Sword Coast might be even cooler. If it seems like the thing to do, the characters could use the franchise restructuring or headquarters modification activities to officially ask permission to relocate their franchise to the Silent Sound lighthouse. (This assumes that Hoobur Gran'Shoop was driven from the basement, and that the characters are prepared to deal with the possibility of him coming back.)": "在潘达林拥有一个小城堡庄园是很酷的。但在剑海岸有一座灯塔可能更酷。如果这看起来是件好事，角色们可以利用特许经营权的重组或总部改造活动，正式请求允许将他们的特许经营权搬迁到寂静之声灯塔。 (这是假设胡伯-格兰肖普被从地下室赶走了，而且角色们准备应对他回来的可能性)。",
	"Even if the characters don't want to officially change territories, nothing prevents them from quietly checking out the commercial landscape in the area. Characters searching the sea caves along the cliffs near the lighthouse might find that a variety of ne'er-do-wells use them as places to hide from naval pursuers, stow contraband, secure prisoners held for ransom, and engage in other nefarious activities. Joining in on (or getting a percentage of) such activities could be set up with the shady business practice activity—possibly connecting to any deal the characters have recently struck with the newly installed captain of a fast ship.": "即使人物不想正式改变领土，也不妨碍他们悄悄地查看该地区的商业景观。搜索灯塔附近悬崖上的海洞的角色可能会发现，各种新的恶棍把它们当作躲避海军追捕者的地方，藏匿违禁品，保护被劫持的囚犯，以及从事其他邪恶的活动。加入（或获得一定比例的）此类活动可以与不正当的商业行为活动联系起来--可能与人物最近与新上任的快船船长达成的任何交易有关。",
	"Characters not wanting to flout the law (or at least not to do so outside their own territory) could instead clear out smugglers and other riffraff along the coast. Doing so as part of a philanthropic enterprise could get them in good with the authorities in Neverwinter or Luskan.": "不想藐视法律的角色（或至少不想在自己的领土之外这样做），可以在沿海地区清除走私者和其他暴徒。作为慈善事业的一部分，这样做可以使他们与永夜城或卢斯坎的当局保持良好关系。",
	"Taking over the lighthouse also provides the opportunity for a philanthropic enterprise. The light is a warning beacon for ships traveling the coast between Neverwinter and Luskan, but it needs someone to keep it running. Before the Order of the Stout Half-Pint moved in, the authorities in Luskan and Neverwinter struggled to entice anyone to live at the remote lighthouse, given the amount of dangerous bandit and pirate activity in the area. If the characters take over the lighthouse or arrange for it to be staffed, they'll earn the favor of Neverwinter, Luskan, and possibly even the Lords' Alliance for their generosity.": "接管灯塔也为慈善事业的发展提供了机会。这盏灯是行驶在永温特和卢斯坎之间海岸的船只的警示灯，但它需要有人来维持它的运行。在Stout Half-Pint骑士团进驻之前，鉴于该地区有大量危险的强盗和海盗活动，Luskan和Neverwinter的当局很难吸引任何人住在这个偏远的灯塔。如果角色们接管了灯塔，或者安排了工作人员，他们会因为自己的慷慨而赢得永夜、卢斯坎，甚至可能是领主联盟的青睐。",
	"While the characters are engaged in downtime and franchise activities, Omin Dran makes contact. He embraces the characters' reports from Phandalin and the Silent Sound lighthouse as proof that Dran Enterprises is involved in the attacks against Acq Inc franchises, and that its agents are willing to kill to claim the components of the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}. However, something about that approach feels inconsistent with Dran Enterprises' normal approach to acquisition. A ruthless attitude and wanting Acquisitions Incorporated taken apart and absorbed into its own corporate space is one thing, but doing it one franchise at a time seems odd. As such, Omin wants more information before committing to reprisals or confrontation.": "当这些人物在进行停工和特许经营活动时，奥明-德兰进行了联系。他接受了人物从范达林和寂静之声灯塔的报告，证明德兰企业参与了对Acq公司加盟店的攻击，而且其代理人愿意杀人以索取{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}的组件。然而，这种做法让人感觉与德兰企业的正常收购方式不一致。无情的态度和希望收购公司被拆开并吸收到自己的公司空间是一回事，但一次做一个加盟店似乎很奇怪。因此，奥明希望在致力于报复或对抗之前获得更多信息。",
	"The characters are directed to go to Luskan to confirm that Dran Enterprises has a secret headquarters in that lawless city. If they do, they then need to find and infiltrate the operation, learning as much as they can about the plans of Acquisitions Incorporated's biggest business rival!": "人物被指示去卢斯坎确认德兰企业在那个无法无天的城市有一个秘密总部。如果是这样，他们就需要找到并渗透到行动中去，尽可能多地了解收购公司最大的商业对手的计划!",
	"The search for the headquarters takes the characters first to the rough-and-tumble Fishbone Tavern, then to Arla Razortongue, a disgruntled Dran Enterprises ex-employee running a well-known peg and hook shop. After dealing with thugs sent to quiet Arla, the characters learn the location of Dran Enterprises' secret headquarters, and can plan their infiltration.": "在寻找总部的过程中，角色们首先来到了粗犷的鱼骨酒馆，然后找到了Arla Razortongue，一个心怀不满的德兰企业前雇员，经营着一家著名的钉子和钩子店。在与被派来镇压阿拉的暴徒打交道后，角色们得知了德兰企业秘密总部的位置，并可以计划他们的潜入行动。",
	"That headquarters is a seemingly small and unimportant ship at the Luskan docks. But Dran Enterprises' magic has filled the ship with portals leading to some of the faction's many franchises, ships, and business locations. When the characters visit, those portals lead to:": "那个总部是在卢斯坎码头的一艘看起来很小、不重要的船。但德兰企业的魔法使这艘船充满了门户，通向该派系的许多特许经营权、船只和商业地点。当人物访问时，这些门户会通往。",
	"A dead ship being consumed by the power of the Far Realm—which quickly threatens to consume the characters as well.": "一艘死船被远界的力量所吞噬--它很快就威胁到了人物的消耗。",
	"A faction warehouse whose overworked attendant will help them only if they help her.": "一个派别仓库，只有当他们帮助她时，其过度劳累的服务员才会帮助他们。",
	"A Dran Enterprises cargo ship caught in a raging storm, and which will founder on rocks unless the characters lend the crew a hand.": "一艘德兰企业的货船陷入了狂暴的风暴中，除非人物向船员伸出援手，否则它将在岩石上开花结果。",
	"Another cargo ship whose well-armed crew will finish the characters off in short order unless they make their way through the rigging unseen.": "另一艘货船，其装备精良的船员会在短时间内解决掉这些人物，除非他们在看不见的情况下通过索具。",

	"Only by traveling through a sufficient number of these portals can the characters key themselves to activating the portal to Dran Enterprises' true headquarters—a palatial ship named {@i The Maverick}. There, they are met by a Dran Enterprises operative who is aware of their quest, and who informs them that Dran Enterprises in fact has nothing to do with the attacks against the two Acquisitions Incorporated franchises. Moreover, Dran Enterprises is also aware of the dark power of the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}—and its operatives have collected two of the orrery's components, hoping to keep that power in check. But the characters are not alone as they seek this information. Operatives of the Six are already within the portal network, and are racing to claim the orrery components collected by Dran Enterprises before the characters do.": "只有通过足够数量的这些传送门，角色们才能启动通往德兰企业真正总部的传送门--一艘名为{@i The Maverick}的豪华飞船。在那里，他们遇到了一位知道他们任务的德兰企业特工，他告诉他们，德兰企业实际上与针对两家收购公司特许经营权的攻击毫无关系。此外，德兰企业也意识到了{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}的黑暗力量--它的特工人员已经收集了桔梗的两个部件，希望能够控制住这种力量。但这些人物在寻找这些信息时并不孤单。六人帮的特工已经进入了传送门网络，并且正在争先恐后地抢在人物之前夺取德兰企业收集的ORRERY组件。",
	"The City of Sails is located far to the north of the Sword Coast, and the journey there can be as eventful as you desire. If the players are hankering for random encounters, the wild lands of the North can certainly oblige them. Or you might wish to have the journey pass in relative peace while the players coordinate franchise tasks left over from the previous episode.": "帆之城位于剑海岸的北部，去那里的旅程可以按照你的愿望多姿多彩。如果玩家渴望随机遭遇，北方的荒野之地肯定能满足他们的要求。或者，你可能希望让旅程在相对平静中度过，而玩家则协调前一集留下的特许任务。",
	"Luskan rests upon stone escarpments on either side of the icy River Mirar. Three bridges, named Upstream Span, Dalath's Span, and Long Span, cross forty feet above the river to connect the two sides of the city.

As they seek out Dran Enterprises' secret headquarters, the characters start in the south and work their way to the Open Shore docks.": "卢斯坎坐落在冰冷的米拉河两岸的石质悬崖峭壁上。三座桥被命名为 \"上游跨度\"、\"达拉斯跨度 \"和 \"长跨度\"，横跨河面40英尺，连接城市的两边。开放海岸的码头位于河的最北端，而龙滩的码头在南边。当他们寻找德兰企业的秘密总部时，角色们从南部开始，一路走到开阔海岸的码头。",
	"A key aspect of Luskan life is its rule by groups known as Ships. Five High Captains each rule a Ship made up of pirates and other Northlanders. Ship Kurth, under High Captain Beniago Kurth, is the First Ship, which controls the city's docks and trade. Ship Baram is the Second Ship, operating the fishing industry. Third Ship Suljack leads piracy and raiding, handing down less-desirable opportunities to Fourth Ship Taerl. Fifth Ship Rethnor acts as the city's guard—an unprofitable enough duty that many of its members look for other ways to earn coin.": "卢斯坎生活的一个重要方面是由被称为 \"船 \"的团体统治。五位高级船长各自统治一艘由海盗和其他北地人组成的船。由高级船长Beniago Kurth领导的Kurth号是第一艘船，它控制着城市的码头和贸易。巴拉姆号是第二艘船，经营捕鱼业。三号船Suljack领导海盗和袭击，将不太理想的机会交给四号船Taerl。第五艘船Rethnor作为城市的卫队--这是一项无利可图的职责，许多成员都在寻找其他方式来赚取硬币。",
	"The order of mages known as the Arcane Brotherhood is the other major power group in Luskan.

	"The characters' main goal in this episode is to find Dran Enterprises' secret headquarters. However, owing to that organization's habit of breaking the legs of anyone who talks about company business, this information is hard to come by. Thankfully, the characters are able to learn that Dran Enterprises employees often frequent a specific tavern in Luskan, giving them a starting point for seeking the information they need.": "本集人物的主要目标是找到德兰企业的秘密总部。然而，由于该组织习惯于打断任何谈论公司业务的人的腿，这一信息很难得到。值得庆幸的是，角色们能够了解到德兰企业的员工经常光顾卢斯坎的一个特定酒馆，这给了他们一个寻求所需信息的起点。",
	"The characters can learn the name and location of the Fishbone tavern in any number of ways, including talking to other tavern owners, seeking out merchants and mercenaries who've done business with Dran Enterprises, and the like.

The shops and taverns lining the main thoroughfare of the City of Sails are as battered and weathered as the grim customers entering them. At first glance, the city's reputation as a den for pirates and raiders appears well earned.": "当你进入卢斯坎时，一股尖锐的冰冷的风呼啸着穿过南门。沿着风帆之城的主干道的商店和酒馆，就像进入它们的严峻的顾客一样，都是破烂不堪，饱经风霜。乍一看，这座城市作为海盗和掠夺者的巢穴的名声似乎很好。",
	"Just ahead of you, a wagon has broken down in front of a tavern. The elderly human driver calls out for help, but passersby ignore her. As she calls out once more, the tavern door behind her opens and two guards toss a young male human in bright clothing out into the street. He tumbles into the old woman, sending both of them sprawling to the ground. The door closes, then opens once more as a mandolin comes flying out of the tavern.": "就在你的前面，一辆马车在一家酒馆前抛锚了。年长的人类车夫大声呼救，但路人都没有理会她。当她再次呼喊时，她身后的酒馆门打开了，两个卫兵把一个穿着鲜艳衣服的年轻男性人类扔到了街上。他翻滚着撞向老妇人，把他们两个人都撞倒在地。门关上了，然后再一次打开，一个曼陀林从酒馆里飞出来。",
	"If the characters want to lend a hand, they have ample opportunity to step up.

	"At some point before the party arrives in Luskan, ask the players whether their characters are bringing the orrery housing and any components with them, and if so, who carries the relics. If they plan instead to secure them elsewhere, ask about that location and their security measures. For the purpose of the adventure, it's best if the characters keep the orrery components with them, rather than leaving them at headquarters. (Certainly, reminding the characters of what happened to the last two franchise headquarters that held orrery components should be enough to inspire them to hold onto the components themselves.)": "在队伍到达卢斯坎之前的某个时候，询问玩家他们的角色是否会带着兽皮箱和任何部件，如果是的话，谁会携带这些遗物。如果他们打算在其他地方保护这些东西，请询问那个地方和他们的安全措施。为了冒险的目的，最好是让角色们把神庙部件带在身边，而不是把它们留在总部。(当然，提醒角色们注意前两个持有桔梗组件的特许经营总部的情况，应该足以激励他们自己保管这些组件）。",

	"As long as they're in Luskan, the characters might take the opportunity to try to extend their franchise's reach into the city. A formal presence in this far-flung territory is far beyond the scope of their charter of operations, naturally. And savvy franchisees might have heard rumors that Head Office is working to open a franchise in the City of Sails. However, clever players could work to increase their own franchise's notoriety and add a few more customers without unduly violating the terms of their contract. You might tie such attempts to future franchise tasks or downtime incorporating the shady business practice activity, as the characters try to keep an official distance from any Luskan opportunities.": "只要他们在卢斯坎，这些人物可能会利用这个机会尝试将他们的特许经营权延伸到这个城市。在这块遥远的土地上的正式存在，自然远远超出了他们的经营章程的范围。精明的加盟商可能已经听说了总部正在努力在风帆之城开设加盟店的传闻。然而，聪明的玩家可以在不过度违反合同条款的情况下，努力提高自己加盟店的知名度，增加一些客户。你可以把这种尝试与未来的特许经营任务或停工期联系起来，将黑幕商业行为活动纳入其中，因为角色们试图与任何卢斯坎的机会保持官方距离。",
	"Dabahl cannot afford the repairs or offer to pay the characters for their service, but in her gratitude, she can share that Dran Enterprises has a nefarious reputation.

Dabahl sells her goods to Ship Kurth and could also introduce the characters to its merchants, though she does not have any influence with them.": "达巴尔负担不起修理费，也不愿意为这些人物的服务支付报酬，但为了表示感谢，她可以分享德兰企业的恶名。他们总部的位置是一个严密的秘密，但据说该组织的员工喜欢一个渔民经常光顾的小酒馆。达波尔向库尔兹船出售她的货物，也可以把人物介绍给其商人，尽管她对他们没有任何影响力。",
	"If the characters stay on her good side, Eriss confides that she doesn't know where Dran Enterprises has its headquarters. However, she can share that the employees of the organization sometimes gather at a watering hole known as Fishbone Tavern.

	"NPC scenes can encourage cooperative roleplaying, so give the players lots of space to discuss how to help characters like Noriel and Dabahl—and then run with the players' ideas. A desire to help Noriel could lead to helping the bard land a paying gig at a tavern, or seeking out one of the Ships or the loremasters of the Arcane Brotherhood to learn of his father. Helping Dabahl could lead to an encounter with a guild of teamsters or a disgruntled repair shop employee. Such efforts could lead to additional roleplaying scenarios, to which you can add ability checks and combat encounters as desired.": "NPC场景可以鼓励合作性的角色扮演，所以给玩家很多空间来讨论如何帮助像诺里尔和达巴尔这样的角色--然后按照玩家的想法去做。帮助诺瑞尔的愿望可能会导致帮助吟游诗人在酒馆找到一份有报酬的工作，或者寻找船主或奥术兄弟会的会长来了解他的父亲。帮助Dabahl可能会导致他遇到一个团队成员公会或一个心怀不满的修理厂雇员。这种努力可能会导致更多的角色扮演场景，你可以根据需要增加能力检查和战斗遭遇。",
	"Of course, some players will simply ignore Dabahl and Noriel. That's okay. Let the characters' reactions take things in a different direction, and have a different NPC provide the same information. However, always feel free to have Dabahl or Noriel make another appearance. Maybe the two team up, with Noriel helping improvise the repairs (soon to fail at any time), while Dabahl teaches Noriel a song or two. Their story can move forward, intersecting with the party's story at a later opportune moment.": "当然，有些玩家会直接无视达巴尔和诺利尔。这也没关系。让人物的反应把事情引向不同的方向，让不同的NPC提供相同的信息。然而，请随时让达巴尔或诺里尔再次出场。也许两人合作，Noriel帮助即兴修理（很快就会失败），而Dabahl教Noriel唱一两首歌。他们的故事可以向前推进，在以后一个合适的时刻与党的故事相交。",
	"Any fisher or laborer in the north of the city can provide directions to Fishbone Tavern. None of the NPCs currently at the tavern know the location of Dran Enterprises headquarters, but they can provide pointers to someone who does.": "城北的任何渔夫或工人都可以提供去鱼骨酒馆的路线。目前在酒馆的NPC都不知道德兰企业总部的位置，但他们可以为知道的人提供指点。",
	"Fishbone Tavern is located a few blocks from Luskan's Open Shore docks, close enough that you can smell the sea air and hear the cries of gulls swooping over the fishing ships. A few lazy snowflakes fall from a cloudy sky as you approach the tavern's front entrance—and a sign decorated with an actual rotting fish nailed to a board bearing the tavern's name. Standing before the door is an immense figure who beams a smile missing most of its teeth. He squints his eyes as if trying to make sense of you. \"What... uh... what's your business here?\"": "鱼骨酒馆距离卢斯坎的开阔海岸码头只有几个街区，近到你可以闻到海风，听到海鸥在渔船上俯冲的叫声。当你走近酒馆的前门时，几片懒洋洋的雪花从阴云密布的天空中飘落下来，还有一个用一条真正的腐烂的鱼钉在写有酒馆名称的木板上的标志。站在门前的是一个巨大的身影，他露出了缺了大部分牙齿的笑容。他眯起眼睛，似乎想弄明白你的意思。\"什么......呃......你在这里有什么事？\"",
	"Zurb knows (and absolutely shouldn't share but does) that employees of Dran Enterprises drink at the Fishbone frequently, though he hasn't seen any of them in a few days. He ponders a while on how that's rather unusual. Zurb can suggest the characters talk to Fryer the bartender to figure out why. (She earned that name when she hit a would-be-thief with a searing-hot frying pan.) Zurb can also describe any of the tavern's regulars, including warning the characters that Rakeem can't be trusted.": "祖尔布知道（绝对不应该分享，但确实知道），德兰企业的员工经常在鱼骨酒吧喝酒，尽管他已经有几天没有看到他们中的任何一个。他思索了一会儿，认为这很不寻常。祖尔布可以建议人物与酒保弗莱尔谈谈，以弄清原因。(她是在用灼热的煎锅打了一个小偷之后才得到这个名字的）。Zurb还可以描述酒馆的任何一个常客，包括警告人物Rakeem是不可信任的。",
	"When the characters decide to enter, Zurb opens the door for them. If the characters have befriended him, Zurb announces them as \"really nice people that talked a lot.\" This causes Fryer to shake her head in weary disbelief.": "当这些人物决定进入时，祖尔布为他们开门。如果这些人物与他交好，祖尔布就宣布他们是 \"非常好的人，说了很多话\"。这导致弗莱尔疲惫地摇头表示不相信。",
	"The interior of the Fishbone Tavern is cramped and shadowy. Only two of the eight tables are occupied, one by two fishers and another by a lone figure in a dark, leather-patched cloak. One wall holds a small, smoky fireplace, while a long bar of dark-stained wood stands along the opposite wall. Standing behind the bar under oval plaques set with yellowing fish skeletons is a heavyset human bartender. She pours ale for a half-elf seated at the bar, quietly engaging him in conversation.": "鱼骨酒馆的内部很拥挤，很阴暗。八张桌子中只有两张有人，一张是两个渔夫，另一张是一个身穿深色皮制斗篷的孤独人物。一面墙上有一个冒烟的小壁炉，而对面墙上则有一个长长的黑漆木条。站在吧台后面的椭圆形牌子下，镶嵌着发黄的鱼骨架，是一个身材魁梧的人类酒保。她为坐在吧台前的一个半精灵倒酒，悄悄地与他交谈。",
	"Although Fryer is tight with Dran Enterprises, she carries a certain amount of guilt over an incident from a few months ago. She reported a former friend and Dran Enterprises operative named Arla Razortongue to her bosses for speaking out about the organization's unethical practices. (See \"The Peg and Hook\" below for more on Arla.) Recent word on the street is that Arla continues to be a thorn in Dran Enterprises' side—and that she's been marked for exile or elimination. A character might sense Fryer's remorse over having sold Arla out with a successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check, and could encourage her to share what took place and where to find Arla with appropriate roleplaying.": "虽然弗莱尔与德兰企业关系密切，但她对几个月前的一个事件怀有一定的愧疚。她向她的老板举报了一个前朋友和德兰企业的特工，名叫阿拉-拉佐通格（Arla Razortongue），因为她说出了该组织的不道德行为。(最近有消息称，Arla仍然是德兰企业的眼中钉，她已经被标记为流放或淘汰。一个角色可以通过成功的DC12智慧({@skill Insight})检查感觉到Fryer对出卖Arla的悔恨，并可以通过适当的角色扮演鼓励她分享发生的事情以及在哪里可以找到Arla。",
	"Word on the street is that Dran Enterprises has \"turtled up,\" retreating into wherever they hide due to some trouble known to the company's higher-ups. Rakeem doesn't know what that trouble is, but one person who keeps her ear to the ground about Dran Enterprises is Arla at the Peg and Hook ({@area see below|1ba|x}). He can share Arla's story and provide directions to her shop.": "有消息说，德兰企业已经 \"龟缩 \"了，由于公司高层知道的一些麻烦，他们躲到了哪里。拉基姆不知道那是什么麻烦，但有一个人对德兰企业的情况一直很关注，那就是Peg and Hook（{@area see below|1ba|x}）的Arla。他可以分享Arla的故事，并提供去她店里的路线。",
	"If the characters help Velos and mention their interest in Dran Enterprises, he shares that he recently overheard a melancholy employee talking about how a friend \"got invited to headquarters but accidentally took a wrong door. They managed to scoop up what was left of him.\" His gratitude also makes him a solid potential hire, especially if the franchise has future business in Luskan.": "如果人物帮助维洛斯并提到他们对德兰企业的兴趣，他分享说他最近无意中听到一个忧郁的员工谈论一个朋友如何 \"被邀请去总部，但不小心走错了门。他们设法把他剩下的东西挖了出来\"。他的感激之情也使他成为一个可靠的潜在雇员，特别是如果特许经营在卢斯坎有未来的业务。",
	"Once the characters have learned about Arla from any of the possible sources at the Fishbone, they can travel to her shop.": "一旦人物从鱼骨的任何一个可能的来源了解到Arla，他们就可以前往她的商店。",
	"Arla Razortongue (CG female human {@creature spy} with iconic Dran Enterprises employee features; see \"{@book Iconic Faction Features|AI|4|Iconic Faction Features}\" in {@book appendix B|AI|4}) had a good thing going as an employee of Dran Enterprises. So when she was fired from that organization, the need to start over again in the cutthroat environs of Luskan inspired her to think outside the box. Way, way outside. Given the number of seedy sailors that call the City of Sails their home port, she knew that a shop helping pirates with limb replacements would always make money. However, she felt that a hook was more useful as a replacement for a leg (instead of the traditional peg leg), and that a peg was more useful to replace a lost hand.": "Arla Razortongue（CG女性人类{@creature spy}，具有德兰企业员工的标志性特征；见{@book appendix B|AI|4}中的\"{@book Iconic Faction Features|AI|4|Iconic Faction Features}\"）作为德兰企业的员工，她有一个好的发展。因此，当她被那个组织解雇后，在卢斯坎这个残酷的环境中重新开始的需要激发了她的思维。非常，非常的超脱。鉴于把风帆之城作为母港的肮脏水手的数量，她知道，帮助海盗更换肢体的商店总是会赚钱的。然而，她觉得钩子作为腿的替代品更有用（而不是传统的钉子腿），而钉子对于替代失去的手更有用。",
	"Dran Enterprises ignored Arla at first, convinced that she would be a failure. Surprisingly, though, the plucky entrepreneur managed to convince enough pirates to try out her unconventional system that her business thrived. She has since developed a number of unique attachments (hook shoes, peg arm accessories) that provide surprising functionality—and even replaced one of her own hands and a leg to prove her point.": "德兰企业一开始没有理会阿拉，认为她会是一个失败者。但令人惊讶的是，这位勇敢的企业家成功地说服了足够多的海盗尝试她的非常规系统，使她的生意兴隆起来。此后，她开发了许多独特的附件（钩子鞋、钉子臂配件），提供了令人惊讶的功能--甚至替换了她自己的一只手和一条腿来证明她的观点。",
	"When the characters approach the Peg and Hook, first decide whether their previous investigation has alerted Dran Enterprises. If they allowed Rakeem to eavesdrop and report their conversations, alerted Eriss the broker of their antagonistic intentions, or asked too many strangers how to find the organization, a strike team is already inside the shop and attacking Arla. Go straight to \"{@area Dran Strike Team|1c0|x}\" below and roll for initiative.": "当人物接近Peg和Hook时，首先要决定他们之前的调查是否已经惊动了德兰企业。如果他们允许Rakeem偷听并报告他们的谈话，提醒经纪人Eriss他们的敌对意图，或者问了太多的陌生人如何找到这个组织，那么一支突击队已经在商店里面，并且正在攻击Arla。直接进入下面的\"{@area Dran Strike Team|1c0|x}\"，然后掷出主动权。",
	"If the characters were discreet in their inquiries, Arla is alone in her shop and can be approached in any way they want. Then run the \"{@area Dran Strike Team|1c0|x}\" encounter as the characters prepare to leave the shop.": "如果角色们在询问时很谨慎，Arla独自在她的商店里，可以以任何方式接近她。然后在人物准备离开商店时，执行\"{@area Dran Strike Team|1c0|x} \"遭遇战。",
	"Arla initially assumes the characters are customers, and points out various arm peg accessories, hook foot options, and other products she has developed. She then whips out a bone saw and asks which of the characters she can help first.": "阿拉最初以为这些人物是顾客，并指出了各种臂钉配件、钩脚选项和她开发的其他产品。然后，她拿出一把骨锯，问哪个人物她可以先帮忙。",
	"When she realizes the characters aren't customers, Arla is disappointed, but she's open to their questions. She despises Dran Enterprises, and is willing to help anyone who opposes that organization. Conveniently (for her), she's also looking for investors to help her expand her burgeoning business. She initially asks for 1,000 gp for her information, or half as much if the characters bring her a paying customer. She can be talked down to 500 gp, or 250 gp with one customer.": "当她意识到这些人物不是顾客时，Arla很失望，但她对他们的问题持开放态度。她鄙视德兰企业，并愿意帮助任何反对该组织的人。方便的是（对她来说），她也在寻找投资者，以帮助她扩大她的蓬勃发展的业务。她最初要求提供1000金币的信息，如果人物能给她带来一个付费的客户，则可得到一半的金币。她可以被说服到500戈比，或者250戈比，只要有一个顾客。",
	"A tiny and unassuming ship named {@i Dangerous Business} is always moored at the Open Shore docks, and is more than it appears. The ship houses a series of magic portals leading to various Dran Enterprises warehouses, ships, marketplaces—and to {@i The Maverick} itself. Each of {@i Dangerous Business}'s magic portals is set with and activated by a differently shaped and colored stone. Employees memorize where each stone leads, but the configuration changes on a regular schedule. Moreover, employees are subject to enchantment magic that prevents them from sharing the information. Arla does not know the current portal configuration.": "一艘名为{@i Dangerous Business}的不起眼的小船总是停泊在开阔海岸码头，而且比它的外表更有意义。这艘船有一系列的魔法门，通往德兰企业的各个仓库、船只、市场--以及{@i The Maverick}本身。每一个{@i Dangerous Business}的魔法门都镶嵌着不同形状和颜色的石头，并由其激活。员工们记住了每块石头的位置，但配置会定期改变。此外，员工还受到魔法的影响，无法分享信息。Arla不知道当前的门户配置。",
	"As the characters rise in level and franchise rank, NPCs will begin to take notice of them, and not just vice versa. Rather than the adventurers constantly thinking about which NPCs might make solid prospective business partners, those NPCs might start showing up later in the adventure to pitch the franchise on commercial deals. Keep note of which NPCs the players have the most fun interacting with, and keep those NPCs in mind for future engagement. Conversely, the NPCs the players most actively dislike could become foes, joining Dran Enterprises or the Six, then appearing later in the campaign to pay the characters back for some real or imagined slight.": "随着人物等级和特许经营权等级的提高，NPC会开始注意到他们，而不仅仅是反过来。与其让冒险者不断考虑哪些NPC可能成为可靠的潜在商业伙伴，不如让这些NPC在冒险后期开始出现，向特许经营商推销商业交易。记下玩家与哪些NPC的互动最有趣，并将这些NPC牢记在心，以便将来接触。相反，玩家最不喜欢的NPC可能会成为敌人，加入德兰企业或六人帮，然后在活动后期出现，为某些真实的或想象中的轻视行为向角色进行报复。",
	"The team's primary objective is to convince Arla to abandon her business and leave town. If she won't, they have orders to kill her. Hoffman focuses on attacking Arla, castigating her verbally and physically for being a traitor to Dran Enterprises. In combat, Arla's shortsword attacks take the form of either her sharpened leg hook or a retractable blade attached to her arm peg.": "该小组的首要目标是说服阿尔拉放弃她的生意并离开小镇。如果她不愿意，他们就奉命杀掉她。霍夫曼专注于攻击阿尔拉，用言语和身体来指责她是德兰企业的叛徒。在战斗中，阿拉的短剑攻击采取的形式是她削尖的腿钩或连接在她手臂上的可伸缩刀片。",
	"The strike team members are dressed in fur cloaks and leathers, and their weapons and armor are well maintained. They have the equivalent of a priest's pack and an explorer's pack between them, plus a total of 180 gp.": "突击队成员身着毛皮斗篷和皮革，他们的武器和盔甲都保养得很好。他们之间有相当于一个牧师的背包和一个探险家的背包，另外还有总共180金币。",
	"Map 4.1 shows the layout of the docks where the characters make their initial approach to Dran Enterprises headquarters.": "地图4.1显示了人物最初接近德兰企业总部的码头布局。",
	"As the characters seek an approach to {@i Dangerous Business} and the portals within, they are unaware that they are competing against the Six, who have already infiltrated the ship and are seeking Dran Enterprise's main headquarters aboard {@i The Maverick}. The Six are initially at no more advantage than the characters are in their search for the headquarters, but the characters' actions might tip that balance one way or the other.": "当人物在寻找进入{@i Dangerous Business}和其中的传送门时，他们并不知道他们是在与六人帮竞争，六人帮已经潜入了飞船，并在{@i The Maverick}上寻找德兰企业的主要总部。在寻找总部的过程中，六人组起初并不比角色们更有优势，但角色们的行动可能会使这种平衡发生变化。",
	"During this part of the episode, you'll track a one-off mechanic called \"failure points,\" which are used to represent the race against the Six and determine which side finds the headquarters first. The resolution of that search is described in the \"{@book On Board {@i The Maverick}|AI|7|On Board The Maverick}\" section, but the characters will have opportunities before that to realize they are competing against the Six. When that becomes clear, you can underscore any situation in which the party earns a failure point, letting the players know that accumulating too many points means that the Six will pass through the final portal and arrive at {@i The Maverick} first.": "在这部分剧情中，你将追踪一个名为 \"失败点 \"的一次性机制，它被用来表示与六人帮的竞争，并决定哪一方先找到总部。在\"{@book On Board {@i The Maverick}|AI|7|On Board The Maverick}\"一节中描述了这一搜索的决议，但在此之前，人物会有机会意识到他们正在与六人帮竞争。当这一点变得清晰时，你可以强调任何一方获得失败分数的情况，让玩家知道，积累过多的分数意味着六人组将通过最后的门户，并首先到达{@i The Maverick}。",
	"As always in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, keep an open mind to alternative ways to advance the story, and don't worry if the characters happen to lose an important fight. The face-off against the Dran Enterprises strike team is a tough encounter, and might not go the way the characters expect.": "和收购公司的活动一样，对推进故事的其他方式保持开放的心态，如果人物碰巧输掉了一场重要的战斗，也不要担心。与德兰企业突击队的对决是一场艰难的遭遇战，而且可能不会像人物所期望的那样发展。",
	"This humorously small ship is watched over by four {@creature Guard||guards} that stand a silent vigil around the cabin. The ship can be reached from the main dock or the smaller jetty leading out between {@i Dangerous Business} and {@i The Rogue}. A single door opens up into the cabin.": "这艘幽默的小船由四个{@creature Guard||guards}人看守，他们在船舱周围默默地守望。这艘船可以从主码头或从(1%)和(2%)之间的小码头到达。一扇门通向船舱。",
	"If any of the guards see the characters as a threat, they shout out, raising the alarm and imposing one failure point. The alarm alerts all other guards on the docks, and can draw an endless supply of reinforcements from other ships over time. As such, the characters should realize quickly that a stand-up fight will involve more foes than they can handle.": "如果任何一个守卫看到这些角色是一个威胁，他们就会大声喊叫，拉响警报并施加一个失败点。警报声惊动了码头上的所有其他守卫，并且随着时间的推移，可以从其他船只上引来无穷无尽的增援。因此，角色们应该很快意识到，站起来的战斗将涉及更多的敌人，而不是他们能够处理的。",
	"The party can retreat and come back when the heat dies down, but this delay imposes another failure point. Or they can push past any threats to get to {@i Dangerous Business} and the portals within.": "队伍可以撤退，等热度消退后再回来，但这种延迟会带来另一个失败点。或者他们可以越过任何威胁，到达{@i Dangerous Business}和里面的传送门。",
	"When the characters step through into the cabin on {@i Dangerous Business}, read:": "当人物在{@i Dangerous Business}上踏入机舱时，请读。",
	"The small square cabin's interior is far larger than its exterior, opening up as an oval room thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide. Crumpled on the floor before an iron door on the far side of the room, the body of a guard lies in a pool of blood. Standing closed between you and the body, six other oval-shaped iron doors are the only features in the room. Each door has a heavy latch that bears the insignia of Dran Enterprises, but no lock is visible. Above each of the iron doors, a differently shaped and colored glowing stone is set.": "这个小方舱的内部远比它的外部大，打开后是一个长30英尺、宽15英尺的椭圆形房间。在房间远处的一扇铁门前，一名警卫的尸体皱缩在地板上，躺在血泊中。在你和尸体之间，还有六扇椭圆形的铁门是房间里唯一的特征。每扇门都有一个沉重的门闩，上面有德兰企业的徽章，但没有看到锁。在每扇铁门的上方，都镶嵌着一块不同形状和颜色的发光石。",
	"The characters can examine the dead guard or investigate the doors and stones. However, the amount of time they have to do so depends on whether they had other guards in pursuit. If the characters were pursued, give them a round or two to investigate the portal nexus, then have an increasing number of guards burst into the area each round, forcing the characters to enter a portal.": "角色们可以检查死去的卫兵或调查门和石头。但是，他们这样做的时间取决于他们是否有其他卫兵在追赶。如果人物被追捕，给他们一两轮时间来调查传送门节点，然后让越来越多的卫兵每轮都冲进这个区域，迫使人物进入传送门。",
	"If the characters infiltrated the ship without raising the alarm, they have five minutes before they hear a guard patrol approaching. If they leave this area to go back onto the deck of {@i Dangerous Business} for any reason, they immediately attract the attention of nearby guards.": "如果人物潜入船内而没有发出警报，他们在听到警卫巡逻队接近前有5分钟时间。如果他们因为任何原因离开这个区域回到{@i Dangerous Business}的甲板上，他们会立即引起附近守卫的注意。",
	"The dead guard is a male half-orc. Lying on his chest is a black business card bearing unintelligible symbols. More notable is that the unfortunate guard's brain has been removed from his shattered skull. The guard was killed by the mind flayer leading the Six operatives (see \"{@area Portal 4|1e0|x}\" and later for more information). The condition of the guard's head makes it impossible to talk to him with {@spell speak with dead}.": "死去的警卫是一名男性半兽人。躺在他胸前的是一张黑色的名片，上面印有无法理解的符号。更值得注意的是，这个不幸的警卫的大脑已经从他破碎的头骨中被取出。这名警卫是被带领六名特工的心灵杀手杀死的（详情见\"{@area Portal 4|1e0|x} \"及后面的内容）。这名警卫的头部状况使他无法用{@spell speak with dead}与他交谈。",
	"Each of the seven doors has a glowing semiprecious stone above it, carved into a different shape: a green turquoise square, a red feldspar triangle, a white pearl circle, a purple amethyst oval, a blue aquamarine rectangle, a black hematite pentagon, and an orange tiger-eye hexagon. A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals an aura of conjuration on the space beyond each door and on each of the stones.": "七扇门的上方各有一块发光的半宝石，雕刻成不同的形状：绿色的绿松石方形，红色的长石三角形，白色的珍珠圆形，紫色的紫水晶椭圆形，蓝色的海蓝宝石矩形，黑色的赤铁矿五边形，以及橙色的虎眼石六边形。一个{@spell detect magic}的咒语在每扇门外的空间和每块石头上显示出一个魔法的光环。",
	"If the stones are removed, they lose their magical properties but are worth 25 gp each.": "如果这些石头被移走，它们就会失去魔法属性，但每块价值25戈比。",
	"Each portal door leads to a different encounter. Opening any door transports all characters in the portal nexus into the area beyond, with the entrance portal disappearing behind them. The characters must navigate the scene that takes place in the new location, then find an exit portal (another iron door identical to the doors in the nexus) to return to the portal nexus. (Portal 1 is an exception, bringing the characters back automatically.) Eventually, the characters find the portal leading to Dran Enterprises' headquarters in this way.": "每个入口门都通向一个不同的遭遇。打开任何一扇门，都会将传送门节点中的所有角色传送到外面的区域，而入口的传送门则在他们身后消失。角色们必须浏览发生在新地点的场景，然后找到一个出口传送门（另一扇与节点中的门相同的铁门）来返回传送门节点。(传送门1是个例外，会自动把人物带回来。)最终，人物通过这种方式找到了通往德兰企业总部的传送门。",
	"The current destinations of the portals are noted on the Portals table. You can choose encounters you favor, or roll on the table to see where the characters end up, rerolling any locations already visited. For the first three destinations, roll a {@dice d6} to prevent the characters from reaching {@i The Maverick}. For subsequent destinations, roll a {@dice d8}. Alternatively, you can allow the characters to reach the headquarters ship (see \"{@book On Board {@i The Maverick}|AI|7|On Board The Maverick}\" below) any time after they've returned from three other destinations.": "传送门的当前目的地在传送门表上注明。你可以选择你喜欢的遭遇，或者在表格上掷骰子，看看角色最终会去哪里，重掷任何已经去过的地点。对于前三个目的地，掷出{@dice d6}以防止角色到达{@i The Maverick}。对于随后的目的地，掷一个{@dice d8}。另外，你也可以允许角色在从其他三个目的地返回后的任何时候到达总部的飞船（见下文\"{@book On Board {@i The Maverick}|AI|7|On Board The Maverick}\"）。",
	"With the exception of the Far Realm horror, the specific locations of portal encounters are not detailed here.

	"A month ago, an encounter with operatives of the Six led Dran Enterprises to try to fight that group using its own dark magic.

	"As the portal opens, a pulse of magic draws you forward. The door vanishes and you stand within an impossible scene. The deck of a ship opens up around you, but the shifting sea to all sides is the color of bruised flesh, roiling beneath a clear sky filled with unfamiliar constellations. Suddenly the door to the ship's main cabin explodes out in a pulse of sickly ethereal light.

	"As the portal opens, you feel a lurch as its magic wraps around you. The door is gone suddenly, and you are standing in a hot and humid warehouse filled with crates stacked to the ceiling. Windows high up on the walls let in light and reveal what look like tropical trees outside. The crates are organized in mazelike rows, making it hard to see how far the warehouse spreads. From somewhere to your right, you hear humming, running footsteps, and the squeak of a wheeled cart drawing closer.": "当传送门打开时，你感到一阵阵颤抖，因为它的魔力包裹着你。门突然消失了，你站在一个湿热的仓库里，里面堆满了堆到天花板的箱子。墙壁上高高的窗户透出光线，露出外面看起来像热带树木的东西。这些板条箱被组织成迷宫般的一排，使人很难看清仓库的范围。从你右边的某个地方，你听到嗡嗡声、跑步的脚步声和一辆轮子车的吱吱声在靠近。",

When an order comes in, it appears magically on Dagdra's ledger, three items at a time (see the Dagdra's List table below). The dwarf calls out the three items, and a character must make an ability check using one of the skills noted for an item to locate that item in the warehouse. Each check represents the act of either physically searching for the item or understanding the characteristics of the item. The narrow space between piles of crates means that only one character can search for each item.": "帮助{@creature Dagdra Deepforge|OoW|Dagdra}完成她的任务涉及一个特定的过程和一些能力检查，都是DC12。当一个订单进来时，它会神奇地出现在Dagdra的账本上，一次三件（见下面的Dagdra的清单表）。矮人叫出了这三件物品，一个角色必须使用为某件物品注明的技能之一进行能力检查，以在仓库中找到该物品。每一次检定都代表了物理搜索物品或了解物品特性的行为。成堆的板条箱之间的狭窄空间意味着每个物品只能由一个角色来搜索。",
	"The items are found and collected regardless of the success or failure of the checks. But if the characters fail three or more of the four checks necessary to collect a group of items, their lackluster performance causes a {@creature bearded devil} productivity specialist to appear and attack the party (including Dagdra) for 1 round. The devil then vanishes, and the party gains a failure point.": "无论检查的成功与否，这些物品都会被找到并收集。但如果人物在收集一组物品所需的四次检查中失败了三次或更多，他们的乏力表现会导致一个{@creature bearded devil}生产力专家出现，并攻击派对（包括达格德拉）1轮。然后，这个魔鬼消失了，聚会获得一个失败点。",

But Bracus believes that even recovering a few components could be enough for the Six to accomplish their goals.": "六人帮在一年多前得到了{@item far gear|AI}--{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}的组件之一。六人帮的特工们现在正积极地寻找孔雀石的其他部件，希望为某种黑暗仪式重建它。但布拉库斯认为，即使恢复一些组件，也足以让六人帮完成他们的目标。",
	"In an attempt to foil the Six, Dran Enterprises secured two of the orrery's components—the {@item chronolometer|AI} and the {@item dimensional loop|AI}. Dran Enterprises also knows that the last unclaimed component, known as the {@item wheel of stars|AI}, has been securely stored in the northern holdfast known as Horn Enclave, and is under the protection of the dwarves who dwell there.": "为了挫败 \"六人帮 \"的行动，德兰企业获得了其中两个部件--{@item chronolometer|AI}和{@item dimensional loop|AI}。德兰企业还知道，最后一个无人认领的部件，即{@item wheel of stars|AI}，已经被安全地储存在被称为 \"霍恩飞地 \"的北方禁地，并受到居住在那里的矮人的保护。",
	"Bracus is aware that the Six are attempting to gain access to the headquarters portal, and suspects they will arrive at any moment.": "布拉库斯知道六人组正试图进入总部的门户，并怀疑他们随时会到达。",
	"If the Six operatives arrive at the headquarters first, Szorrulax easily defeats and kills Bracus. When the characters arrive, Szorrulax is claiming Dran Enterprises' two components, having destroyed the lizardfolk's {@item Living Loot Satchel|AI|living loot satchel} to empty its contents. Roll for initiative, but Szorrulax's first act is to {@spell plane shift} away.": "如果六名特工先到达总部，Szorrulax会轻易地击败并杀死Bracus。当人物到达时，Szorrulax正在索取Dran企业的两个组件，他已经破坏了蜥蜴人的{@item Living Loot Satchel|AI|living loot satchel}来清空里面的东西。掷出主动权，但Szorrulax的第一个行动是{@spell plane shift}离开。",
	"If Bracus is alive, all Dran Enterprises personnel have been magically ordered to allow the characters to leave the Luskan docks unharmed. If such a message is not received, the guards on the boat and the docks react badly to the party's appearance, and the characters must sneak, talk, or fight their way to safety. Once away from the docks, the characters can lie low for as long as necessary, then depart Luskan.": "如果布拉库斯还活着，所有德兰企业的人员都被神奇地命令允许人物安然离开卢斯坎码头。如果没有收到这样的信息，船上和码头上的守卫会对他们的出现做出不好的反应，角色们必须偷偷摸摸地，通过交谈或战斗来获得安全。一旦离开了码头，人物可以根据需要潜伏一段时间，然后离开卢斯坎。",
	"The Six? Don't waste my time with fables. Yeah, there are people who don't like Acq Inc. People with grudges. People with axes to grind. But they're not some sort of... I don't know, cult or gang or whatever.How am I so sure? Because I've been in this from the beginning. Do you have any idea what I know? What I've seen? The hits I've taken for Acquisitions Incorporated? If there were a cabal of subtle masterminds working the shadows, cunningly plotting the downfall of Acq Inc, they would have definitely recruited me by now.": "那六个人？不要用寓言来浪费我的时间。是的，有一些人不喜欢Acq公司。有怨恨的人。有仇必报的人。但他们不是某种... ... 我不知道，邪教或帮派什么的。我怎么这么肯定？因为我从一开始就在这里面了。你知道我知道什么吗？我看到了什么？我为收购公司所受的打击？如果有一帮狡猾的主谋在暗地里捣鬼，狡猾地策划着Acq公司的垮台，他们现在肯定已经把我招来了。",
	"With their exciting portals-based adventures in Luskan done, the characters attain 5th level! Just as importantly, they've learned that Dran Enterprises isn't the real villain behind the attacks on Acquisitions Incorporated franchises. If the characters spoke to Bracus or obtained the book from the lizardfolk's satchel, they also have a solid lead indicating that Horn Enclave holds the final orrery component. If they failed to talk to Bracus and have not yet deciphered the book, see \"{@area Enter Flabbergast|207|x}\" in the next episode to bring them up to speed.": "随着他们在卢斯坎（Luskan）激动人心的门户式冒险的完成，角色们达到了5级！他们已经了解到德兰企业并不是攻击收购公司特许经营权背后的真正恶棍。同样重要的是，他们了解到德兰企业并不是攻击收购公司特许经营权背后的真正恶棍。如果人物与Bracus交谈过，或者从蜥蜴人的挎包里得到了那本书，他们也就有了一条可靠的线索，表明Horn Enclave拥有最后的ORRERY组件。如果他们没能与布拉库斯交谈，并且还没有破译这本书，请看下一集的\"{@area Enter Flabbergast|207|x}\"，让他们了解情况。",
	"When the characters complete the journey from Luskan back to their headquarters, they find their half-orc majordomo in a great mood.": "当人物完成了从卢斯坎回到总部的旅程时，他们发现他们的半兽人大夫心情很好。",
	"Gilda Duhn is all tusks, grinning from ear to ear. \"I just heard word from Head Office! The bosses have been watching how well you run the business, and your mission in Luskan is all anyone is talking about! Our license has been expanded to cover a broader territory around Phandalin! And even better, I've been crunching the profit statements, and I think we're ready to expand this headquarters!\"": "吉尔达-杜恩满脸堆笑，从耳朵到耳朵。\"我刚刚听到总部的消息! 老板们一直在关注你的经营状况，而你在卢斯坎的任务是所有人都在谈论的! 我们的许可证已经扩大到范达林周围更广泛的地区! 更妙的是，我一直在琢磨利润表，我想我们已经准备好扩大这个总部了！\"",
	"As the characters attain 5th level, the franchise attains rank 2! You and the players should all spend some time in the \"{@book Franchise Advancement|AI|1|Franchise Advancement}\" and \"{@book Company Positions|AI|1|Company Positions}\" sections of chapter 2 to read up on the exciting improvements for the franchise, for its headquarters, and for the characters as their company positions yield even more powerful benefits.": "当人物达到5级时，特许经营权也达到了2级！你和玩家都应该花一些时间在\"{@book Franchise Advancement|AI|1|Franchise Advancement} \"和\"{@book Company Positions|AI|1|Company Positions} \"章节中阅读特许经营权、总部和人物的激动人心的改进。你和玩家都应该在第二章的\"{@book Franchise Advancement|AI|1|Franchise Advancement} \"和\"{@book Company Positions|AI|1|Company Positions} \"部分花一些时间来阅读关于特许经营权、总部和角色的激动人心的改进，因为他们的公司职位会带来更多的好处。",
	"All the characters' hard work and luck to date is about to pay off in the form of headquarters upgrades! The \"{@book Franchise Advancement|AI|1|Franchise Advancement}\" section in chapter 2 has details of the cosmetic, expansion, transportation, and weapon options available to the characters for their headquarters. The available upgrades can cover literally any features that you and the players decide on, but always keep in mind the ways in which the events and developments of the adventure might drive those upgrades.": "迄今为止，所有人物的努力和运气都将以总部升级的形式得到回报! 第二章的\"{@book Franchise Advancement|AI|1|Franchise Advancement} \"部分详细介绍了角色们的总部可供选择的外观、扩展、交通和武器。可用的升级可以涵盖你和玩家决定的任何功能，但要始终牢记冒险中的事件和发展可能推动这些升级的方式。",
	"For example, the expansion option available to the headquarters might amount to simply digging out more space beneath Tresendar Manor. But it also might arise as a result of the franchise moving its headquarters to the Silent Sound lighthouse—or even claiming both sites as a joint headquarters. That latter option is even easier to set up if the characters' possession of the orrery and its components allows them to channel teleportation magic into their headquarters as their transportation option.": "例如，总部可用的扩张方案可能只是在特伦达庄园下面挖出更多空间。但它也可能是由于特许经营权将其总部迁至静音灯塔而产生的，或者甚至将这两个地方作为联合总部。如果角色们拥有魔法阵及其组件，就可以将传送魔法引入总部作为他们的运输选择，那么后一种选择就更容易建立了。",
	"At rank 2, the franchise gains four additional untrained hirelings and one skilled hireling, allowing the characters to hire new staff to meet their needs. Such hires can be done in-character if the players enjoy those kinds of scenes—and the franchise could even set up a job fair for potential employees at a local market or tavern. If the characters have made any allies or hired NPCs during preceding episodes, those NPCs might be taken on as official staff members at this time. This is also an excellent time to bring in an NPC the characters enjoyed interacting with, making that character an official part of the franchise family.": "在等级2中，特许经营权获得了四个未经训练的雇佣者和一个熟练的雇佣者，使角色可以雇佣新的员工来满足他们的需要。如果玩家喜欢这类场景，这种雇佣可以在角色中进行--专营权甚至可以在当地市场或酒馆为潜在的雇员设立一个招聘会。如果角色在之前的剧情中结交了任何盟友或雇佣了NPC，那么这些NPC就可以在这个时候作为正式员工加入。这也是一个很好的时机，可以让人物喜欢的NPC加入，使该人物成为特许经营家族的正式成员。",
	"In addition to staff, ten crew are hired to help with the franchise. In addition to working on the upkeep of the franchise headquarters, these NPCs might be part of the team necessary to operate a mobile headquarters (sailors for a sailing ship or airship, arcane engineers for a walking statue or teleporting tavern, and so forth).": "除了工作人员之外，还雇佣了十名船员来帮助特许经营。除了从事特许经营总部的维护工作外，这些NPC可能是运营移动总部所需团队的一部分（帆船或飞艇的水手，行走的雕像或传送的酒馆的奥术工程师，等等）。",
	"Advancing a franchise is meant to be a major accomplishment for the players and their characters. This is a moment to celebrate and reward the party's deeds and to help the players get excited about designing and selecting their franchise upgrades. Some players might focus on mechanics, while others enjoy the creativity of dreaming up how a franchise headquarters looks and feels. There is no wrong way to approach the process.": "推进特许经营权是为了让玩家和他们的角色取得重大成就。这是一个庆祝和奖励党的事迹的时刻，并帮助玩家对设计和选择他们的专营权升级感到兴奋。有些玩家可能会专注于机械，而另一些人则喜欢梦想特许经营总部的外观和感觉的创造力。在这个过程中，没有错误的方法。",
	"Headquarters customization is deliberately open-ended to allow for creativity. This might create some work for you as the DM, since you adjudicate the characters' customization choices. A good rule of thumb is to allow the players full creative freedom while sticking to the mechanics (however loose) presented by the rules in chapter 2. If the characters want their headquarters to be a giant bouncing rubber ball, let them go for it! In the end, that option can still make use of the general idea and mechanics of a walking statue headquarters, even if the description of the headquarters' appearance and movement is vastly different.": "总部的定制是故意开放的，以允许创造性的存在。这可能会给作为DM的你带来一些工作，因为你要对角色的定制选择进行裁决。一个好的经验法则是允许玩家有充分的创造自由，同时坚持第二章中的规则所提供的机制（无论多么宽松）。如果角色们想让他们的总部成为一个巨大的弹跳橡胶球，就让他们去做吧 最后，这种选择仍然可以利用行走的雕像总部的一般想法和机制，即使对总部的外观和运动的描述有很大的不同。",
	"Once the characters are done planning their upgrades, Gilda the majordomo takes over the mundane task of hiring contractors and starting construction. The length of time it takes for upgrades to be completed is up to you, but one to two months is reasonable. During that period, the characters have plenty of opportunity to engage in downtime activities and franchise tasks.": "一旦人物完成了他们的升级计划，大法官吉尔达就会接手雇佣承包商和开始施工的平凡任务。完成升级所需的时间由你决定，但一到两个月是合理的。在这期间，人物有很多机会从事停工活动和特许经营任务。",
	"During the break between episode 4 and episode 5, the characters are likely to be focused on deciding their next move. The urgency of seeking out the final orrery component at Horn Enclave depends on whether the party successfully claimed the two components held by Dran Enterprises, or whether they watched the mind flayer Szorrulax vanish with the components in hand. Moreover, knowing that the Six are behind the attacks on Acquisitions Incorporated, the characters can learn everything Head Office knows about that faction—but what is known about the Six amounts to little more than rumors and their somewhat-trademark-infringing logo. You can tease any of the information from \"{@book Factions and Rivals|AI|2|Factions and Rivals}\" in chapter 3 as you see fit.": "在第4集和第5集之间的休息时间，人物很可能会集中精力决定他们的下一步行动。在 \"霍恩飞地\"（Horn Enclave）寻找最后一个ORRERY组件的紧迫性，取决于当事人是否成功地领回了德兰企业持有的两个组件，或者他们是否眼睁睁地看着思想絮乱者Szorrulax带着组件消失。此外，知道六人帮是袭击收购公司的幕后黑手，角色可以了解总部对该派别的一切了解--但对六人帮的了解也仅仅是谣言和他们有点侵犯商标权的标志。你可以根据自己的需要，从第三章的\"{@book Factions and Rivals|AI|2|Factions and Rivals} \"中挑出任何信息。",
	"Since the characters are now running a rank 2 franchise, they can assign two franchise tasks to be run by staff in addition to any personal downtime activities they wish to engage in. If those downtime activities or franchise tasks involve actively seeking connections to and information about Horn Enclave, that information can be revealed in any number of ways.": "由于这些人物现在正在经营一个二级特许经营权，因此除了他们希望从事的任何个人停工活动外，他们还可以分配两个特许经营任务，由工作人员负责。如果这些停工活动或特许经营任务涉及到积极寻求与霍恩飞地的联系和信息，那么这些信息可以通过任何一种方式被披露。",
	"Characters or staff engaging in the research, marketeering, or scrutineering activities can uncover all kinds of connections to the dwarven Clan Horn and its fabled fortress.

	"The carousing activity can bring the characters into closer contact with merchants or nobles connected to Horn Enclave. One of those is a company called Dhargun Ironworks, who are sending a caravan to the enclave within the next month for the unlikely purpose of celebrating a wedding. {@adventure Episode 5|OoW|5} has much more information on the Dhargun wedding—and the unique opportunity it offers for the characters to gain access to the enclave.": "狂欢活动可以使人物与与霍恩飞地有关的商人或贵族有更密切的接触。其中之一是一家名为Dhargun Ironworks的公司，他们将在下个月派一个大篷车到飞地，目的是为了庆祝一场婚礼，这不太可能。{@adventure Episode 5|OoW|5}有更多关于达贡婚礼的信息，以及它为人物进入飞地提供的独特机会。",

And as they learn about the enclave, they'll also discover its storied and problematic (for them) connections to Acquisitions Incorporated:": "你可以使用以下准则，让人物快速了解霍恩飞地。随着他们对飞地的了解，他们也会发现飞地与收购公司之间的故事性和问题性（对他们来说）联系。",
	"Horn Enclave is a dwarven stronghold run by the wealthy shield dwarves of Clan Horn.": "霍恩飞地是一个矮人据点，由富裕的霍恩氏族的盾牌矮人经营。",
	"Lady Kira Horn and Lord Zardak Horn head the clan. Rizwin Horn is their daughter, and the public face of the enclave. Ironbeard is the enclave's head mage.": "基拉-霍恩夫人和扎尔达克-霍恩勋爵是该部族的首脑。里兹温-霍恩是他们的女儿，也是飞地的公众形象。铁胡子是飞地的首席法师。",
	"The dwarves of Horn Enclave are no friends to Acquisitions Incorporated. During a prior visit to/incursion of/assault against Horn Enclave by Acquisitions Incorporated, a number of regrettable incidents occurred.": "霍恩飞地的矮人并不是收购公司的朋友。在收购公司之前对霍恩飞地的访问/入侵/攻击中，发生了一些令人遗憾的事件。",

This might include information on residents and guards, gaining access to the hold, the general workings of its vaults, and so forth.": "如果人物加倍研究，如果你愿意，你可以分享第五集的\"{@area Horn Enclave|21b|x} \"部分的额外具体细节。这可能包括关于居民和守卫的信息，获得进入船坞的机会，船库的一般运作情况，等等。",
	"The more the characters learn about Horn Enclave, the stronger their understanding that getting inside will be a difficult task for most—and an impossible task for anyone openly connected to Acquisitions Incorporated. Thankfully, Head Office has some assistance it can offer in that regard as the characters plan their incursion!": "人物对霍恩飞地了解得越多，他们就越明白，对大多数人来说，进入霍恩飞地将是一项艰巨的任务，而对任何与收购公司有公开联系的人来说，则是一项不可能完成的任务。值得庆幸的是，在角色们计划入侵时，总部在这方面可以提供一些帮助",
	"The characters (now 5th level) know that Horn Enclave is the hiding place of the last unclaimed clockwork component of the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}, called the {@item wheel of stars|AI}.

	"With the help of Acq Inc fixer Flabbergast, the characters make use of a unique ritual that lets them swap bodies with a group of dwarves heading to the enclave for a wedding. This gives the characters access to the vaults, but the deception creates complications as they struggle with the deep secrets of their possessed dwarves and must try to keep the wedding on track.": "在Acq公司修理工Flabbergast的帮助下，这些人物利用一种独特的仪式，让他们与一群前往飞地参加婚礼的矮人交换身体。这使角色们能够进入金库，但这种欺骗行为造成了复杂的局面，因为他们要与被附身的矮人的深层秘密作斗争，并必须努力保持婚礼的正常进行。",
	"Accessing the orrery component vault reveals valuable information from the clockwork creatures that guard the vault. But the characters are ultimately chagrined to discover that the component isn't there, with the vault set up as a ruse to distract anyone attempting to rebuild the orrery. Still, the orrery's creator—a wizard named Lottie—wishes to meet anyone savvy enough to have come this far, provided they share her interest in ensuring that the orrery's power is never used.": "进入ORRERY组件库，从看守库房的发条生物那里得到了宝贵的信息。但这些人物最终懊恼地发现，组件并不在那里，金库被设置成一个诡计，以分散试图重建金库的人的注意力。不过，金库的创造者--一个名叫洛蒂的巫师--希望能见到任何足够聪明的人，只要他们和她一样有兴趣确保金库的力量永不被使用。",
	"Traveling in style in a borrowed {@vehicle battle balloon|AI}, the characters journey to Lottie's sanctum in the Greypeak Mountains. But en route, the franchise is intercepted by airships belonging to the Six. The characters get their first glimpse of Splugoth the Returned, one of the Six's mysterious members, and the point goblin for the plan to claim the orrery.

If the characters haven't yet figured out that the enclave is where the component is stored, Flabbergast can fill in the missing bits of what they know, all the while chiding the characters for missing important clues.

	"Flabbergast can also provide or reinforce the backstory regarding Acquisitions Incorporated's well-known incursion of the enclave. In response to any discussion of that past mission, the wizard sums up the party's position as follows:": "Flabbergast还可以提供或加强有关收购公司对飞地的著名入侵的背景故事。在回应任何关于那个过去的任务的讨论时，巫师会将党的立场总结如下。",
	"The characters will not have heard of the legendary ritual Flabbergast names, which has long been lost to history. Its magic allows characters to enter a dreamlike state, leaving their bodies safely behind while their souls temporarily possess other bodies. Flabbergast explains that the ritual's creator died long ago, and its components are now unknown. But if the characters can help him determine and track down those components, Flabbergast can provide them the perfect means to infiltrate the dwarven stronghold. By taking possession of some other group with legitimate business in the enclave, the characters can wander its vaults at their leisure without arousing suspicion. Well, maybe just a little suspicion. But it'll all be fine.": "人物不会听说过传说中的仪式Flabbergast的名字，它早已消失在历史中。它的魔力可以让人物进入一种梦幻般的状态，将他们的身体安全地留在身后，而他们的灵魂则暂时拥有其他身体。Flabbergast解释说，这个仪式的创造者很久以前就死了，它的组成部分现在也不知道。但如果角色们能帮助他确定并追踪这些成分，弗拉贝加斯特就能为他们提供完美的手段来潜入矮人的堡垒。通过占有其他一些在飞地里有合法业务的团体，角色们可以在不引起怀疑的情况下随意逛逛它的金库。好吧，也许只是有点怀疑。但这一切都会好起来的。",
	"You decide what form the ritual's components might take, from ancient verses and arcane inscriptions, to rare herbs and alchemical reagents, to any other obscure bit of magical paraphernalia in between. You also decide how much time and what specific effort is necessary for the characters and Flabbergast to determine and track down those components. This might involve short side quests of your own devising, or having NPCs conveniently turn out to be a source of some components. The Splintfig sisters from episode 2 are good candidates, as is Hoobur Gran'Shoop if the party stayed on good terms with the psychopathic gnome.": "你决定仪式的组成部分可能采取什么形式，从古老的诗句和神秘的铭文，到稀有的草药和炼金试剂，再到介于两者之间的任何其他晦涩的魔法用具。你还可以决定人物和Flabbergast需要多少时间和哪些具体努力来确定和追踪这些组件。这可能涉及到你自己设计的简短的侧面任务，或者让NPC很容易地成为一些组件的来源。第二集里的Splintfig姐妹是很好的人选，如果党派与变态地精保持良好的关系，Hoobur Gran'Shoop也是如此。",
	"If the characters take more downtime to seek out the ritual's components, they might use marketeering to find customers or brokers of magical supplies and rare spell components. The shady business practice activity could alternatively turn up connections to those who dabble in more dangerous and secretive magic.": "如果人物用更多的休息时间来寻找仪式的组件，他们可能会用市场手段来寻找客户或魔法用品和稀有法术组件的经纪人。阴暗的商业实践活动也可能会发现与那些涉足更危险、更隐秘的魔法的人的联系。",
	"This episode assumes that the characters make use of Flabbergast's ritual to enter Horn Enclave, but the information presented on the enclave is easily adaptable to other approaches. As such, the players and characters are absolutely free to come up with other methods of seeking the final orrery component. Even though the dwarves of Clan Horn remain furious at Acquisitions Incorporated and the enclave's defenses are formidable, the players should always have the last say regarding the characters' actions.": "本集假设人物利用Flabbergast的仪式进入Horn Enclave，但关于飞地的信息很容易适应其他方法。因此，玩家和角色们完全可以想出其他的方法来寻找最后的奥瑞金组件。尽管霍恩家族的矮人对收购公司仍然很愤怒，飞地的防御也很强大，但玩家应该对角色的行动有最后的决定权。",
	"Workable alternatives include such plans as the characters secreting themselves aboard the Dhargun Ironworks caravan, posing as last-minute wedding guests, or masquerading as others making a vault deposit. They might attempt to convince the guards that their appointment time was somehow overlooked, pay someone off to learn the song of the day that is the password into the enclave, or any other plan they dream up.": "可行的方案包括：人物秘密登上达贡铁厂的大篷车，冒充最后一刻的婚礼客人，或者伪装成其他人在金库存款。他们可能会试图说服守卫说他们的预约时间被忽略了，买通某人来学习当天的歌曲，作为进入飞地的密码，或者其他任何他们想出的计划。",
	"If another plan is hatched, Flabbergast successfully seeks out the components for the astral transmogrification ritual by himself, strictly as a backup plan for the characters. He's been ordered to journey to the enclave with the party and watch over the operation, and provides one of the characters with a small stone token bearing the symbol of Acquisitions Incorporated.": "如果有另一个计划，Flabbergast会自己成功地寻找到星际转生仪式的组件，严格来说是作为人物的一个备份计划。他被命令与队伍一起前往飞地，并监视行动，并为其中一个角色提供了一个印有收购公司标志的小石块令牌。",
	"If the characters need the ritual performed in an emergency, they can activate the token by speaking the command word \"Whippoorwill.\" Flabbergast then uses a crystal ball to locate them and perform the ritual. By possessing the bodies of dwarf guards and Clan Horn operatives, the characters should be able to successfully defend their own magically slumbering bodies and get them out of the enclave safely. And possessing the token also puts the characters in a position where the ritual might be cast accidentally if they don't use it to enter the enclave, strictly for your amusement.": "如果人物在紧急情况下需要进行仪式，他们可以通过说出 \"Whippoorwill \"这个命令词来激活令牌。然后Flabbergast会用水晶球来定位他们并进行仪式。通过拥有矮人守卫和角族特工的身体，角色们应该能够成功地保护自己的魔法沉睡的身体，并将他们安全地带出飞地。而拥有令牌也让人物处于一个位置，如果他们不使用令牌进入飞地，仪式可能会被意外地施放，这完全是为了让你感到高兴。",
	"The Dhargun Ironworks caravan bound for Horn Enclave is set to reach the main gates in the morning, then depart again that evening. With the characters able to enter the enclave in the bodies of the caravan's wedding party, they can locate the vault, secure the orrery component, and leave when the caravan departs at the end of the day.

Or if the players are dying for some action, you can use wandering monsters to liven the journey up. Once close enough, the characters can set their franchise down in a safe location away from prying eyes, then approach the wide dirt road leading to Horn Enclave. From the safety of cover alongside the road, Flabbergast casts his ritual when the Dhargun Ironworks caravan is spotted. See \"{@area Flabbergast's Ritual|228|x}.\" Flabbergast casts the {@i ritual of astral transmogrification} as the caravan comes to a stop. As the magic takes effect, each character's consciousness departs its normal body and enters that of a named caravan NPC. Go down the list of caravan NPCs in the order presented in the \"{@area Wedding Guests|211|x}\" section above, assigning each guest to a random player until each character has an NPC.

The lever chamber north of the Hall of War controls the main gates and the two portcullises north of the Hall of War. The lever chamber east of the forge controls the portcullis south of the Hall of War. The lever chamber west of the war room controls two portcullises east of the dwarven residences.

Players can share their secret goal with other individual players once they learn it, as long as sharing it would not contradict that goal. For example, the player running Gwendolyn should not share their goal with the player running Tannus, because the whole point is for Gwendolyn to surprise her new husband with the gift. Likewise, the player running Rala does not share her goal with anyone having an interest in what's in the vaults.": "婚礼日程表提供了当天活动的概况，这也是你制造欢笑和灾难的秘诀之一。在指定的时间，客人们从一个地方到另一个地方，开始一个特定的事件。如果一个NPC有一个秘密，它就会在相应的事件中启动。把一个NPC的玩家带到一边，告诉他们他们的秘密目标，并解释这个目标对他们所居住的身体的重要性意味着他们不得不努力完成这个目标。玩家在得知自己的秘密目标后，可以与其他个人玩家分享，只要分享不会与该目标相矛盾。例如，经营格温多林的玩家不应该与经营坦纳斯的玩家分享他们的目标，因为整个重点是让格温多林用礼物给她的新丈夫一个惊喜。同样地，经营拉拉的玩家也不会与任何对金库中的东西感兴趣的人分享她的目标。",
	"In any free time between events, or by sneaking away from events, the characters can try to realize their primary goal of finding the final orrery component.

	"Unlike a typical dungeon infiltration, the layout of the enclave is not as important as the itinerary. Players are not expected to turn this into a dungeon crawl, if only because Horn Enclave is teeming with guards and other dwarves. Any wedding guests seen in private chambers or away from the events of the wedding itinerary are given a warning the first time, then questioned more carefully and searched each time thereafter. Evidence of theft or other lawbreaking could result in a guest being supervised by a guard until the caravan departs.": "与典型的地下城渗透不同，飞地的布局并不像行程那样重要。我们不希望玩家把这变成一个地牢的爬行，如果只是因为霍恩飞地有大量的卫兵和其他矮人的话。任何在私人房间或远离婚礼行程的活动中看到的婚礼客人，第一次会被警告，之后每次都会被更仔细地询问和搜查。盗窃或其他违法行为的证据可能会导致客人被警卫监督，直到商队离开。",
	"If the dwarves of Horn Enclave somehow find out that the characters are members of Acquisitions Incorporated, permanent incarceration or execution are among the best possible outcomes.

If the check fails by 5 or more, the construct animates and attacks.": "如果被问及这个构造，里兹温称它为屠宰石驱逐者，并解释说它的存在是为了保护霍恩飞地。她笑着说：\"莫拉丁帮助任何与我们作对的人\"。铁胡子或里兹温可以激活这个构造，或者任何进入它肚子里的控制面板并使用盗贼工具成功进行DC20灵巧检查的人都可以激活它。如果检定失败了5次或更多，那么这个构造就会被激活并攻击。",
	"The slaughterstone eviscerator is a deadly wild card, which might serve as a frightening distraction or be woven into the characters' outrageous plans. It uses the stat block of a {@creature stone golem}, but its slam attack is a blade attack that deals slashing damage.": "屠宰石驱逐者是一张致命的野牌，它可能作为一个可怕的分心，或者被编织进人物的离谱计划中。它使用的是{@creature stone golem}的状态块，但它的猛击是一种刀刃攻击，造成砍伤。",
	"When all other business is done, Rizwin addresses the wedding party one last time.": "当所有其他事务都完成后，里兹温最后一次向婚礼派对致辞。",
	"\"Your vault awaits, ready for the gifts each family has brought for the wedding. As instructed, we will safeguard these gifts until Gwendolyn and Tannus are ready to receive them. For today only, keys will be given to Thoman Dhargun and Gorat Thunderwind, for the storage of any additional gifts during the celebration. After that time, Thoman Dhargun will retain one key and Horn Enclave shall retain the other.\"": "\"你的保险库在等待，准备好了每个家庭为婚礼带来的礼物。按照指示，我们将保护这些礼物，直到格温多林和坦努斯准备好接受它们。仅在今天，钥匙将交给托曼-达贡和戈拉特-雷风，以便在庆典期间储存任何其他礼物。在此之后，托曼-达贡将保留一把钥匙，霍恩飞地将保留另一把。\"",
	"Rizwin then grows suddenly stern. \"Please remember that Horn Enclave is a secure location. As we are responsible for our other clients, you are expected to remain at all times with your group in the areas indicated for your itinerary. Now, let us proceed together to the vaults.\"": "里兹温随后突然变得严厉起来。\"请记住，霍恩飞地是一个安全的地方。由于我们要对其他客户负责，所以你要一直和你的团队一起留在你的行程所指定的区域内。现在，让我们一起前往金库。\"",
	"Rizwin leads the wedding party through the double doors to the north, through the corridor leading past the barracks where dwarf guards can be seen lounging and training, and to the vaults. The double vault indicated with an \"X\" on the map is the vault for the wedding gifts, the largest and most valuable of which are deposited at this time. (Characters with a solid background in company history might recall that this is the same vault that the core members of Acquisitions Incorporated once robbed.)": "里兹温带领婚礼队伍穿过北面的双门，通过通往军营的走廊，可以看到矮人卫兵在那里休息和训练，然后来到金库。地图上标有 \"X \"的双保险库是存放结婚礼物的保险库，其中最大和最有价值的礼物就存放在这个时候。(对公司历史有深入了解的人物可能会记得，这是收购公司的核心成员曾经抢劫过的那个金库）。",
	"Each vault door is covered in iron bands, lined with lead to prevent scrying, is air- and watertight, and features layers of locks that make opening a vault without its keys nearly impossible. Two keys are required to open a vault door, with one typically held by the enclave and a second by the owner of the vault's contents. When both keys have been turned in multiple locks, the door opens. While the wedding is in progress, Gorat and Thoman each have one of the keys for the wedding vault.": "每个金库的门都用铁带覆盖，内衬铅以防止窥探，空气和水都是密封的，并且有多层锁，没有钥匙几乎无法打开金库。打开金库门需要两把钥匙，一把通常由飞地持有，另一把由金库内容物的所有者持有。当这两把钥匙在多把锁中被转动时，门就会打开。当婚礼正在进行时，戈拉特和索曼各自拥有婚礼金库的一把钥匙。",
	"The vault holding the orrery component has one of its keys held by Ironbeard. The other key is with Lottie at the end of this episode. See \"{@area Orrery Vault|24a|x}\" below for more information.": "存放ORRERY组件的金库，其中一把钥匙由铁胡子持有。另一把钥匙在本集结束时在洛蒂那里。更多信息见下文\"{@area Orrery Vault|24a|x}\"。",
	"Three consecutive successful DC 20 Dexterity checks using thieves' tools are required to open an outer vault door. Failing any check requires restarting the process. After three overall failures, the door to the vault gives off a loud ringing noise and four guards come to investigate. The DC is reduced to 10 if the character has one of the vault's keys. Any character who has read the vault records (found in Ironbeard's quarters or Lady Kira and Lord Zardak's quarters) has advantage on checks to open a vault door.": "需要连续三次使用盗贼工具进行成功的DC20灵巧检查才能打开外库门。任何检查失败都需要重新开始这个过程。总共三次失败后，金库的门会发出响亮的铃声，四个守卫会来调查。如果角色有金库的钥匙，那么DC就会降低到10。任何读过金库记录（在铁胡子的房间或基拉夫人和扎尔达克勋爵的房间找到）的角色在打开金库门的检查中都有优势。",
	"Despite how strong the doors and magic of the vaults are, the walls between adjacent vaults are relatively thin. Dealing 40 bludgeoning or force damage to an inner wall creates a hole wide enough for a character to enter another vault. (What kind of attention doing so attracts is left to your determination.) Other means of entering might be possible, including some of the scrolls carried by {@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW} the tabaxi (see \"{@area 11:30 AM|237|x}\").": "尽管金库的门和魔法有多强，但相邻金库之间的墙壁却相对较薄。对一个内墙造成40的重击伤害或武力伤害，就会产生一个足够宽的洞，让一个角色进入另一个金库。(这样做会引起什么样的注意由你决定。)其他的进入方式也是可能的，包括一些由{@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW}tabaxi携带的卷轴（见\"{@area 11:30 AM|237|x}\"）。",
	"Some vaults are set up as two rooms, with the magically locked door of the second room also requiring a password to be spoken before the door can be opened. The wedding vault is a double vault, with the password set as seen at \"Ironbeard's Entrance\" below.": "有些金库被设置成两个房间，第二个房间被魔法锁住的门也需要说出密码才能打开。婚礼金库是一个双层金库，其密码设置如下文 \"铁胡子的入口 \"所示。",
	"The single vault holding the orrery component is immediately northeast of the vault marked \"X.\" This vault is further detailed in the \"{@area Orrery Vault|24a|x}\" section below. Discovering which vault holds the component is an important bit of business that the characters must accomplish at some point during the day. Rizwin knows the location, as does Ironbeard, Lady Kira, and Lord Zardak. The contents of all vaults are also noted in the vault records, a copy of which is kept in Ironbeard's quarters, with another copy in Lady Kira and Lord Zardak's quarters. A character who has studied the records has advantage on checks to open any vault door.": "装有魔法阵组件的单一金库紧邻标有 \"X \"的金库的东北方向。这个金库在下面的\"{@area Orrery Vault|24a|x} \"部分有进一步的说明。发现哪个金库有这个部件是一件重要的事情，人物必须在一天中的某个时候完成。里兹温知道这个位置，铁胡子、基拉夫人和扎尔达克勋爵也知道。所有金库的内容也都记录在金库记录中，其中一份保存在铁胡子的宿舍里，另一份保存在基拉夫人和扎尔达克大人的宿舍里。研究过这些记录的人物在打开任何金库门的检查中具有优势。",
	"When he's convinced that all is well, Ironbeard asks the couple to set the password they wish to use for the inner door. For the duration of the wedding, the inner door will remain open so that Gorat and Thoman can access the vaults. But Ironbeard explains that afterward, even someone with both keys cannot open the inner vault unless Gwendolyn or Tannus speaks the password.": "当他确信一切正常时，铁胡子要求这对夫妇设置他们希望用于内门的密码。在婚礼期间，内门将保持开放，以便戈拉特和索曼可以进入金库。但铁胡子解释说，之后，即使有两把钥匙的人也无法打开内库，除非格温多林或坦努斯说出密码。",
	"If the characters are running Gwendolyn and Tannus, they can set the password as they wish. If the characters are not possessing the wedding guests but are present in the vault, things can get potentially interesting.": "如果这些人物在管理格温多林和坦努斯，他们可以按自己的意愿设置密码。如果这些人物没有附身于婚礼宾客，但却出现在金库中，事情就有可能变得很有趣。",
	"If the players are not running the wedding party at this point—and if they're up for even more of a roleplaying and improvisational challenge—Gwendolyn and Tannus look to one another and whisper, \"Whippoorwill.\" They laughingly explain that a whippoorwill flew overhead when they first met. Ask any characters within earshot (as they will be if they're acting as tag-along wedding guests) to make Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks, with the highest check overhearing the password. That character gets a moment's warning of what's coming.": "如果玩家在这时没有主持婚礼--如果他们想接受更多的角色扮演和即兴表演的挑战--温多林和坦努斯互相看了一眼，低声说：\"Whippoorwill\"。他们笑着解释说，当他们第一次见面时，头顶上飞过一只whippoorwill。要求任何在耳边的角色（如果他们作为随行的婚礼客人，他们会在耳边）进行智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查，检查结果最高的人听到了密码。这个角色会得到片刻的警告，知道将要发生什么。",
	"In an amazing coincidence, \"Whippoorwill\" is the phrase Flabbergast set on the stone token to trigger casting the ritual. If the players have come up with a savvy approach to entering the enclave that didn't make use of the ritual, you don't need to use this option. But if your group will have fun with it, Flabbergast hears the word spoken and casts the ritual, so that the characters' bodies slip into a state of slumber as they possess the bodies of the wedding party. What approach the possessed dwarves—now run by the players—might take to explain the characters' sudden unconsciousness, then safely hide those slumbering bodies away, is up to the players and you.": "一个惊人的巧合是，\"Whippoorwill \"是Flabbergast为触发施放仪式而设置在石头令牌上的短语。如果玩家们想出了一个进入飞地的精明办法，没有利用仪式，你就不需要使用这个选项。但如果你的小组会玩得很开心的话，弗拉博格斯特听到了所说的话并施放了仪式，这样人物的身体就会在附身于婚礼当事人的身体时滑入沉睡状态。被附身的矮人--现在由玩家管理--可能会采取什么方法来解释角色的突然昏迷，然后安全地把那些沉睡的尸体藏起来，这取决于玩家和你。",
	"No secrets specifically activate at this time. However, Thoman and Gorat now each have a key to the vault that allows them to act on their secrets later.": "这时没有秘密具体激活。然而，索曼和戈拉特现在各有一把金库的钥匙，允许他们以后对自己的秘密采取行动。",
	"Rizwin leads the caravan party back through the barracks, then north, west, and north again to the tavern.": "里兹温带领商队返回，穿过军营，然后向北，向西，再向北，来到酒馆。",
	"Great tree trunks have been cut in half to form a series of long tables in this drinking hall. The northern wall behind the bar is formed entirely of kegs of ale, all of them tapped. Busy servers pour frothy mugs and serve them to the multitude of dwarves already here. As Rizwin steps into the tavern, she claps her hands once and several dwarves quickly clear two central tables for the wedding party and guests. Tall mugs of amber beer are served, while platters loaded with skewers of roasted meat and root vegetables are brought to the table. Drinks and food are on the house!": "大树的树干被切成两半，在这个饮酒大厅里形成了一系列的长桌。吧台后面的北墙完全是由一桶桶的啤酒组成的，所有的啤酒都已被打开。忙碌的服务员倒出泡沫杯，并把它们端给已经在这里的众多矮人。当里兹温走进酒馆时，她拍了一下手，几个矮人迅速为婚礼当事人和客人清理出两张中央桌子。高脚杯的琥珀色啤酒被端了上来，而装着烤肉串和根茎类蔬菜的盘子被端到了桌上。饮料和食物都是免费的!",
	"For the next two hours, the caravan party enjoys ale and food, toasts Gwendolyn and Tannus, and swaps tall tales. Guests can visit other tables to meet Clan Horn dwarves, so the characters can move around without drawing attention to themselves. Ironbeard and Rizwin are both here, and the characters can speak to them to try to pick up clues as to the location of the orrery component. (Attempts by any characters to hit on Rizwin are made with disadvantage.)": "在接下来的两个小时里，商队一行人享受着啤酒和食物，向格温多林和坦努斯敬酒，并交换着高大的故事。客人们可以到其他桌去见霍恩家族的矮人，所以人物可以四处走动而不引起别人的注意。铁胡子和里兹温都在这里，角色们可以和他们交谈，试图找出关于兽栏组件位置的线索。(任何角色试图击中Rizwin都是不利的。)",
	"Many of the Clan Horn dwarves have been drinking heavily. Targeting the heavier drinkers can grant advantage on checks made to pry information from them. While in the tavern, the dwarves are relaxed and won't react negatively to a failed Charisma check. However, continued failures result in guards being called. Those guards issue a warning against bothering folk not in the wedding party, and might eventually search or incarcerate any individual who continues to cause trouble.": "许多霍恩家族的矮人都喝得很厉害。瞄准喝得比较多的人，可以在向他们打探消息的检查中获得优势。在酒馆里，矮人都很放松，不会对魅力检查失败作出消极反应。然而，持续的失败会导致守卫被叫来。这些守卫会发出警告，禁止打扰不在婚礼队伍中的人，并可能最终搜查或监禁任何继续制造麻烦的人。",

After looting the treasury of a religious order she was formerly affiliated with, {@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW} has come to Horn Enclave to deposit her ill-gained goods and lay low for a while. Whether her franchise is known to the characters (and whether her recent theft was done for the franchise or as a solo job) is left up to you.

Zardak is half-blind and periodically confers with his wife to make sure he is speaking to the correct person. Both are pleased to have a wedding in their halls, and they engage in small talk to ask polite questions of their guests.

	"At a time of your choosing, Lord Zardak appears to notice something odd about one of the characters or the body they inhabit, but this ends up just being his bad eyesight. Fifteen minutes after they arrive, the two take their leave.": "在你选择的时间，扎尔达克勋爵似乎注意到其中一个人物或他们居住的身体有什么奇怪的地方，但这最终只是他的视力不好。在他们到达15分钟后，两人告辞。",

The temple is beautifully carved to depict the Mordinsamman (the dwarven pantheon), including fine statues of Moradin, Clangeddin Silverbeard, Berronar Truesilver, and Haela Brightaxe.": "穿着最好的衣服，达贡和雷风家族的成员前往神庙。里兹温带领他们向南穿过战争大厅，向东经过矮人的住所。铁胡子走出他的住处与他们会合，如果角色们还没有弄清楚的话，就可以知道那个区域的位置。这座神庙雕刻得非常漂亮，描绘了莫丁萨曼（矮人万神殿），包括莫拉丁（Moradin）、克兰格丁-银须（Clangeddin Silverbeard）、贝罗纳-特鲁西尔弗（Berronar Truesilver）和海拉-布莱特克斯（Haela Brightaxe）的精致雕像。",

To appease Amara, he wants to check the vault and report to her if all is not well. This requires borrowing Gorat's key, which Gorat lends willingly (whether run by a player or not). The mercurial Thunderwind has no concerns that a Dhargun lackey would dare do anything to jeopardize the wedding. However, if Gorat's key is still missing after being stolen by Rala, the doppelganger will need to quickly arrange to have it found to avoid a sudden catastrophe.": "仪式开始后，索曼有一种奇怪的感觉，因为他想起了阿玛拉对金库的担心，以及如果金库里的东西被盗，可能会对两家人之间仍然不和的关系产生什么影响。为了安抚阿玛拉，他想检查金库，如果一切都不顺利，就向她报告。这需要借用戈拉特的钥匙，而戈拉特是心甘情愿地借给他的（无论是否由玩家操作）。多情的雷风并不担心一个达贡的走狗会敢于做出危害婚礼的事情。然而，如果戈拉特的钥匙在被拉拉偷走后仍然下落不明，二重奏就需要迅速安排人找到它，以避免突然发生灾难。",
	"Jormun would normally provide a fiery ceremony on the virtues of the Mordinsamman, with an emphasis on Clangeddin's battle prowess. If a character is controlling him, that character can be put on the spot to describe the ceremony and how the dwarves reconcile the different elements of the pantheon (in particular, the balance between gods of war such as Clangeddin and those of marriage and home, such as Berronar Truesilver). Clan Dhargun is pleased by an emphasis on the hearth, while Clan Thunderwind appreciates an emphasis on battle.": "乔蒙通常会提供一个火热的仪式，介绍莫丁萨曼的美德，并强调克兰格丁的战斗力。如果有一个角色在控制他，那么这个角色可以当场描述这个仪式，以及矮人如何调和万神殿的不同元素（尤其是在战争之神如Clangeddin与婚姻和家庭之神如Berronar Truesilver之间的平衡）。达贡氏族对强调炉灶感到高兴，而雷风氏族则欣赏对战斗的强调。",
	"The hall then grows quiet. Look to the characters inhabiting the wedding couple, letting them know everyone is staring at them. If they don't guess what's happening, one of the guests leans forward and reminds the couple to join Jormun on the altar. The guests have a good laugh at the couple forgetting the ceremony details, chalking it all up to the pair being nervous.": "大厅随即变得安静起来。看向居住在婚礼夫妇中的人物，让他们知道大家都在盯着他们。如果他们没有猜到发生了什么，其中一个客人就会向前倾，提醒这对夫妇在祭坛上加入乔蒙。宾客们对这对夫妇忘记了仪式的细节感到很好笑，认为这一切都是因为这对夫妇紧张。",
	"Once at the altar, Jormun asks for the couple's vows. This is a fun opportunity to see if the two players want to improvise vows, since they were supposed to have memorized them. After the vows, Jormun pronounces them a married couple and the hall erupts in cheers.": "一旦到了祭坛，乔尔蒙就要求这对夫妇的誓言。这是一个有趣的机会，看看这两个玩家是否想即兴创作誓言，因为他们应该已经记住了。宣誓后，乔尔蒙宣布他们成为夫妻，大厅里爆发出欢呼声。",
	"After allowing everyone to receive the couple, Rizwin thanks Jormun for the wonderful ceremony (even if it left much to be desired) and leads everyone back the way they came and north to the dining hall. Characters could try to make their way to the vault at this time, though anyone doing so runs into Thoman, and are likely to be noticed arriving late to the celebration.": "在让大家迎接这对新人之后，里兹温感谢乔蒙的精彩仪式（尽管它还有很多不足之处），并带领大家原路返回，向北走到饭厅。角色们可以尝试在这个时候前往金库，不过这样做的人都会遇到索曼，而且很可能会被发现在庆祝会上迟到。",
	"The dining hall has been festooned with colored streamers and lit with huge braziers.

Ironbeard, Rizwin, and even {@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW} are all here, though Lady Kira and Lord Zardak are not.": "饭厅里已经挂上了彩色的旗帜，用巨大的火盆点燃。中间的长桌包括食物的盘子和客人的座位，而旁边的桌子上放着与会者的礼物（包括一些来自霍恩家族的礼物）。侍者们带来了麦酒和烈酒，气氛喜气洋洋。铁胡子、里兹温，甚至{@creature Two Dry Cloaks|OoW}都在这里，不过基拉夫人和扎尔达克大人不在。",
	"Gorat's secret is the first to activate in this section. His goal is to come up with a toast that calls Tannus to battle, to see once and for all whether his friend has changed. Encourage the player whose character possesses Gorat to make up a toast that urges Tannus to tell a story of his prowess at war. Secretly, Gorat hopes that Tannus turns down the challenge. How Tannus responds could determine whether his clan has an easier or harder time calming down once chaos erupts. A good battle tale leaves them eager to fight!": "高拉特的秘密是本节中第一个启动的。他的目标是想出一个祝酒词，召唤坦纳斯参加战斗，以一劳永逸地了解他的朋友是否已经改变。鼓励拥有Gorat的角色的玩家编造一个祝酒词，敦促Tannus讲述他在战争中的能力的故事。暗地里，Gorat希望Tannus拒绝这个挑战。坦纳斯的反应可能决定他的部族在混乱爆发后是更容易还是更难平静下来。一个好的战斗故事会让他们渴望战斗!",

	"If an item has been stolen, Amara's secret triggers and she races to get her battleaxe from the gift table. She then begins searching for the culprit and screaming about thieves and saboteurs.

	"News of any trouble at the vault spreads like wildfire, and members of both families begin accusing each other. Chaos erupts! Thankfully, the guards of Horn Enclave know that any dwarven wedding comes with a certain amount of chaos, and are keen to let the two families sort their problems out before getting involved. As such, this scene is a great opportunity for the characters to explore their NPCs' personalities and backstories as things get heated. By focusing on the humor of potential conflicts, you can avoid having the guards rush in as a first response.": "金库出现麻烦的消息像野火一样蔓延开来，两个家族的成员开始相互指责。混乱爆发了! 值得庆幸的是，\"号角飞地 \"的守卫知道任何矮人的婚礼都会伴随着一定程度的混乱，他们很想在介入之前让两个家庭把他们的问题解决。因此，这个场景是一个很好的机会，可以让人物在事情变得激烈的时候探索他们的NPC的个性和背景故事。通过关注潜在冲突的幽默感，你可以避免让卫兵作为第一反应冲进去。",
	"The characters have many options here. They could use the opportunity to escape (or head to the orrery vault if they haven't already). More than likely, they'll be inside NPC bodies and need to defuse the situation so they can reach the caravan departure phase in one piece.": "人物在这里有很多选择。他们可以利用这个机会逃跑（如果还没有的话，也可以去兽栏的金库）。更有可能的是，他们会在NPC的身体里，需要化解这种情况，以便他们能够完整地到达商队出发阶段。",
	"The characters could try to save the marriage, perhaps resolving the crime by pinning it on one person (or convincing Rala to take the fall). Let the players develop a plan and add reactions from the crowd (including Clan Horn NPCs) as needed. Accusations and turmoil prompt Ironbeard and several guards to inspect the wedding vault, which could lead to the discovery of any breach into the orrery vault.": "角色们可以尝试挽救这段婚姻，也许通过将罪行归咎于一个人（或说服拉拉背黑锅）来解决。让玩家制定一个计划，并根据需要加入人群（包括角族的NPC）的反应。指责和骚动促使铁胡子和几个卫兵检查婚礼的金库，这可能会导致发现任何进入兽皮金库的漏洞。",
	"If violence breaks out between the families (or between Horn Enclave and any possible thieves), Tannus finds that he really wants to avoid being violent. This might be his last chance to prove his love to Gwendolyn! Jormun's secret causes him to protect the married couple at all costs. His actions could help bring the warring families together by example.": "如果家族之间爆发暴力事件（或霍恩飞地和任何可能的盗贼之间），坦努斯发现他真的想避免暴力事件。这可能是他向格温多林证明他的爱的最后机会了！。乔蒙的秘密导致他要不惜一切代价保护这对夫妻。他的行动可能有助于以身作则地将交战的家庭团结起来。",
	"If the characters have already accessed the orrery vault, they could decide they don't care what happens and sit on the sidelines to watch. In this case, take the events directly to them so that they're encouraged to react. An effective technique is to couple an NPC approaching them with a surge of emotions within one of the controlled NPCs. For example, Ironbeard could call for everyone to be searched, just as Amara (and the character controlling her) begins to contemplate what might befall her daughter if the families decide the wedding is invalid.": "如果人物已经进入了矿石库，他们可以决定不关心发生了什么，而坐在一旁观看。在这种情况下，把事件直接告诉他们，这样他们就会被鼓励做出反应。一个有效的技巧是将接近他们的NPC与被控制的NPC中的一个人的情绪波动联系起来。例如，当阿玛拉（以及控制她的角色）开始考虑如果家族决定婚礼无效，她的女儿会遭遇什么时，铁胡子可以要求对所有人进行搜查。",
	"Once the chaos dies down, the guests can go back to merrymaking until the evening comes. If the chaos doesn't die down, the dwarves of Clan Horn eventually order the warring Dhargun and Thunderwind families to leave the enclave and sort out their problems on their own.": "一旦混乱平息，客人们就可以继续狂欢，直到夜晚来临。如果混乱没有平息，霍恩家族的矮人最终会命令交战的达贡和雷风家族离开飞地，自行解决他们的问题。",
	"Guests are led—or driven at spear point—through the Hall of War and out the main doors to their waiting carriages. (Characters who triggered the ritual within the enclave will need to juggle getting both their dwarven hosts and their original bodies out.) Rizwin, Ironbeard, Lady Kira, and Lord Zardak all come to say appropriate goodbyes. Ironbeard takes Gorat's key, then returns to the dining hall with several guards to take any last gifts from the celebration to the vault. By the time he does so, the caravan has safely departed.": "客人们被带着或被驱赶着穿过战争大厅，走出大门外到他们等待的马车上。(在飞地内触发仪式的角色需要把他们的矮人主人和他们原来的身体都弄出来。) 里兹温、铁胡子、基拉夫人和扎尔达克大人都来做了适当的告别。铁胡子拿走了高拉特的钥匙，然后带着几个卫兵回到饭厅，把庆典上最后的礼物带到金库。当他这样做的时候，商队已经安全离开了。",
	"The characters can say any final words. If they stole any treasure, they can attempt to drop it over the side of the caravan for later retrieval. As the sun dips below the horizon, Flabbergast's ritual ends and the characters return to their normal bodies. Continue with the section \"{@area Battle in the Skies|26b|x}\" as they travel toward Lottie's domain.": "角色们可以说任何最后的话。如果他们偷了任何财宝，他们可以尝试把它扔到商队的边上，以便以后取回。当太阳落到地平线下时，Flabbergast的仪式结束了，人物也回到了他们正常的身体。继续进行\"{@area Battle in the Skies|26b|x} \"部分，他们向洛蒂的领地行进。",
	"At some point during the wedding itinerary, the characters attempt to breach the vault containing the {@item wheel of stars|AI}. See the \"{@area 11 AM|226|x}\" section for information on the wedding vault, the vault doors, and other defenses. When the characters enter the orrery vault, read:": "在婚礼行程中的某个时刻，人物试图攻破装有{@item wheel of stars|AI}的金库。有关婚礼金库、金库门和其他防御措施的信息，请参见\"{@area 11 AM|226|x} \"部分。当人物进入金库时，请阅读。",
	"Statues of human-sized brass dragons stand at the center of the vault, their heads pointed at a globe of light hovering in the air between them. A circular clockwork device floats within the light, recognizable even at a distance as one of the components of the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}.\"": "人类大小的铜龙雕像站在金库的中心，它们的头对准了盘旋在它们之间空中的光球。一个圆形的发条装置漂浮在光中，即使在远处也能认出是{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}的组成部分之一。\"",
	"Each of the dragon statues in this area is a {@creature clockwork dragon|AI} (see {@book appendix B|AI|4}), and is indistinguishable from a metal statue until it moves. If the characters are possessing the bodies of the dwarf wedding guests, two clockwork dragons are on guard here. If the characters are themselves, they face five of the creatures.": "这个区域的每一个龙形雕像都是{@creature clockwork dragon|AI}（见{@book appendix B|AI|4}），在移动之前与金属雕像无异。如果人物是附身于矮人婚礼客人的身体，则有两条发条龙在此守候。如果人物是自己，他们将面对五只生物。",
	"Properly engaging the constructs gives the characters a chance to learn about the orrery's creator and where she can be found. As part of the conversation, the clockwork creatures start off by asking the characters the following questions:": "适当地与这些构造物接触，可以让角色们有机会了解桔园的创造者，以及在哪里可以找到她。作为对话的一部分，发条生物一开始就向人物提出了以下问题。",
	"\"Who are you, and what are your ideals?\" (Ideals related to running a business or earning a fortune appear to please the clockwork creatures.)": "\"你是谁，你的理想是什么？\" (与经营企业或赚取财富有关的理想似乎能让发条生物感到高兴。)",
	"\"Who do you serve?\" (The clockwork creatures show no reaction to any response.)": "\"你为谁服务？\" (发条生物对任何反应都没有表现出反应。)",
	"\"Why have you come to Lottie's vault?\" (This can lead the characters to ask about Lottie, who the clockwork creatures know as the wizard who created the orrery.)": "\"你为什么要来洛蒂的金库？\" (这可以引导人物询问洛蒂的情况，发条生物知道他是创造桔梗的巫师）。",
	"If any character mentions the orrery, the clockwork creatures ask, \"Why do you seek the orrery?\" (Responses that suggest the franchise is trying to stop some great evil can result in the clockwork creatures sharing Lottie's location.)": "如果有哪个角色提到箭塔，发条生物就会问：\"你为什么要找箭塔？\" (如果回答表明特许经营权是为了阻止某种巨大的邪恶，就会导致发条生物分享洛蒂的位置）。",
	"\"What would disappoint you the most right now?\" (If a character mentions the need to recover the final orrery component, a clockwork creature answers, \"Prepare to be disappointed.\")": "\"现在什么会让你最失望？\" (如果一个角色提到需要恢复最后的轨道组件，一个发条生物会回答：\"准备好失望吧。\")",
	"\"What is the best way to make money?\" (The clockwork creatures are particularly pleased if a risky endeavor, including running a franchise, is mentioned.)": "\"什么是赚钱的最好方法？\" (如果提到有风险的工作，包括经营特许权，发条生物会特别高兴）。",
	"If fully and properly engaged, the clockwork creatures share the following information:": "如果充分和适当地参与，发条生物共享以下信息。",
	"The creatures state that they will harm only those who have come to the vault with the intent of misusing the orrery (which they assume includes anyone trying to steal the component). However, they are not automatically friendly to those claiming other intent.": "这些生物表示，它们只会伤害那些来到金库、意图滥用ORRERY的人（它们认为这包括任何试图偷取组件的人）。然而，它们对那些声称有其他意图的人并不自动友好。",
	"The creatures were created to guard this vault and its contents.": "这些生物被创造出来是为了守护这个金库和里面的东西。",
	"Lottie, a powerful wizard and clockmaker, created them. (The clockwork dragons do not identify Lottie as a lich.)": "洛蒂，一个强大的巫师和钟表匠，创造了它们。(钟表龙并没有认定洛蒂是个巫师）。",
	"Lottie also created the orrery, but later scattered it and its components. The creatures do not know why Lottie did this.": "洛蒂也创造了箭塔，但后来把它和它的部件都撒了出去。生物们不知道洛蒂为什么这样做。",
	"\"It is best not to cross Lottie. She destroys all who dare rise against her.\"": "\"最好不要与洛蒂作对。她会毁掉所有敢于反抗她的人。\"",
	"If the creatures believe the characters' cause is just (or at least coincidentally would prevent a great evil), they can share that Lottie lives in a cave near a destroyed town called Fortune, located amid hills to the east of the Greypeak Mountains, not far from the desert of Anauroch.": "如果生物们相信人物的事业是正义的（或者至少是巧合地会阻止一个巨大的邪恶），他们可以分享Lottie住在一个被摧毁的小镇附近的山洞里，这个小镇叫Fortune，位于Greypeak山脉东部的丘陵之中，离Anauroch的沙漠不远处。",
	"The town of Fortune was built recently and quickly destroyed by Lottie for daring to challenge her authority.": "财富镇是最近建成的，并很快被洛蒂摧毁，因为它敢于挑战她的权威。",
	"\"Lottie would not like our telling you too much about her. She's very powerful, is a master of clockwork, and has lots of style.\"": "\"洛蒂不会喜欢我们告诉你太多关于她的事情。她非常强大，是一位钟表大师，而且有很多风格。\"",

	"The final orrery component, the {@item wheel of stars|AI}, appears to float within the globe of light. However, the characters are ultimately unsuccessful in their attempt to claim the component, because the orrery's creator is using the vaults of Horn Enclave as a clever ruse.": "最后一个神器部件，{@item wheel of stars|AI}，似乎漂浮在光球中。然而，角色们最终还是没能成功地得到这个部件，因为金字塔的创造者正在利用霍恩飞地的金库作为一个巧妙的诡计。",
	"{@i Congratulations on the determination that got you this far in search of the {@item wheel of stars|AI}! And sorry that your reward has been denied you. The wheel has been with me always, and even as this ruse is ended, I promise it shall never be given over to those who would use the power of the orrery for woe.

	"If the characters kill the clockwork dragons without talking to them, the constructs are able to speak even after being smashed. This can allow the characters to question them, and vice versa. If the characters completely miss all the clues in this section, additional downtime or asking Head Office for help can provide details regarding someone named Lottie with a penchant for creating clockwork creatures.": "如果人物在不与发条龙交谈的情况下杀死了它们，那么这些构造物即使在被打碎后也能说话。这可以让角色向它们提问，反之亦然。如果角色们完全错过了这部分的所有线索，那么额外的停工时间或向总部寻求帮助可以提供有关一个名叫洛蒂的人的细节，这个人对创造发条生物情有独钟。",
	"Though the characters are unable to claim the final orrery component at this time, they now know where it and its creator can be found. Once the caravan departs and they return to their bodies, they can plan their next move.": "虽然这些人物此时无法领回最后的饰品部件，但他们现在知道在哪里可以找到它和它的创造者。一旦商队离开，他们回到自己的身体，就可以计划他们的下一步行动。",
	"The journey south and east to the Greypeak Mountains covers miles of treacherous terrain, and time is of the essence.

	"The characters can report back the outcome of their Horn Enclave mission to Flabbergast or Omin Dran, or Head Office makes contact with them if they report back to Gilda Duhn first.

	"The primary focus of the agreement is to clarify the incomprehensibly high rental cost (waived by Omin for this mission), and to emphasize that the vehicle remains the property of Acquisitions Incorporated. The lengthy process of signing, countersigning, witnessing, and signing again is followed by the characters providing samples of fingernail and hair clippings. In case of the destruction of the balloon and all aboard, the company reserves the right to resurrect characters as indentured servants to work off the loss.": "协议的主要重点是澄清令人费解的高额租金（奥明为这次任务免除了租金），并强调车辆仍然是收购公司的财产。漫长的签字、会签、见证、再签字的过程中，人物提供了指甲和头发剪的样本。如果气球和车上的人都被毁了，公司保留复活人物作为契约仆人的权利，以弥补损失。",
	"The crew that delivered the {@vehicle battle balloon|AI} remain with the ship, though the characters are firmly in charge and have plenty to do on board, as seen in the next section. {@book Appendix C|AI|5} provides combat statistics for the {@vehicle battle balloon|AI} (because you know that's coming), so assume that a suitable number of crew are available to operate the balloon and its weapons alongside the characters.": "运送{@vehicle battle balloon|AI}的船员仍然和船在一起，尽管人物被牢牢地控制着，并且在船上有很多事情要做，正如在下一节所看到的。{@book Appendix C|AI|5}提供了{@vehicle battle balloon|AI}的战斗统计数据（因为你知道那会到来），所以假设有适当数量的船员可以和角色一起操作气球和它的武器。",
	"If the characters' mobile headquarters is something cool enough that they would rather use it than the borrowed battle balloon to travel to the Greypeaks, that's fine. Just rework the encounters in the \"Riders on the Storm\" and \"{@area Battle in the Skies|26b|x}\" sections appropriately. For example, a giant walking robot can be toppled by rough storm winds or damaged by lightning and hail. The area around a teleporting headquarters such as a tavern that lets characters travel to other taverns can become the site of the Six's airship attack, and so forth.": "如果人物的移动总部足够酷，以至于他们宁愿用它而不是借来的战斗气球来旅行到Greypeaks，那也没问题。只要把 \"暴风雨中的骑士 \"和\"{@area Battle in the Skies|26b|x} \"部分的遭遇适当地改写一下。例如，一个巨大的步行机器人可以被粗暴的暴风吹倒或被闪电和冰雹损坏。诸如酒馆这样的传送总部周围的区域可以让人物前往其他酒馆，可以成为六人组的飞艇攻击地点，等等。",

On a success, the behir takes 15 bludgeoning damage as it components start to grind, and it is no longer able to recharge its lightning breath.": "任何与{@creature clockwork behir|OoW}战斗的角色都可以看到它复杂的工作安排给了它一个独特的弱点。任何在它5英尺范围内的角色都可以使用一个动作，尝试用珠宝商的工具或盗贼的工具进行DC14灵巧检查。如果成功，贝里尔就会在它的部件开始磨碎时受到15的重击伤害，而且它不再能够充实它的闪电气息。",
	"Lottie, her couch, and her dog are all a projected illusion. The lich nonetheless behaves like a classic villain, and is keen to reveal secrets during the battle if the characters try to explain themselves or do a deal with her. She is generally forthright in her answers (because she's proud of her brilliance and expects the characters to die), revealing any of the following information:": "洛蒂、她的沙发和她的狗都是投影出来的幻象。然而，这个巫师的行为却像一个典型的反派，如果角色试图解释自己或与她做交易，她会在战斗中热衷于透露秘密。她一般都会直截了当地回答（因为她为自己的聪明才智感到骄傲，并期待着角色们的死亡），透露出以下任何信息。",
	"Lottie created the orrery and its components, but she quickly grew to regret having done so, since the artifact could destroy the world if used improperly.": "洛蒂创造了手镯及其组件，但她很快就对这样做感到后悔，因为如果使用不当，这件文物可能会毁灭世界。",
	"When she realized how dangerous the orrery was, Lottie scattered its pieces and left the message in Horn Enclave that brought the characters here.": "当她意识到桔梗有多危险时，洛蒂把桔梗的碎片撒了出去，并在霍恩飞地留下了信息，把这些人物带到这里。",
	"She is aware that the orrery's components have been coming together, and that all the missing components and the orrery housing have now been found.": "她意识到，口轮机的部件一直在组合，现在已经找到了所有丢失的部件和口轮机外壳。",
	"She knows that the Six wants the orrery. That organization has bargained with terrible powers, which have instructed them in how to use the orrery and its components to open a portal to the Far Realm.": "她知道 \"六人帮 \"想要那块金字塔。该组织已经与可怕的力量讨价还价，这些力量指导他们如何使用口轮及其部件来打开一个通往远界的门户。",
	"If the portal is opened, the world will likely be destroyed. A shame, really, because Faerûn is such a profitable place.": "如果门户被打开，这个世界很可能会被摧毁。真的很遗憾，因为Faerûn是一个如此有利可图的地方。",
	"Even if the Six don't have all the orrery components, they'll be able to start their ritual given enough time, tapping into the power of the Far Realm from somewhere in the material world.": "即使六人组没有所有的矿石组件，只要有足够的时间，他们就能开始他们的仪式，从物质世界的某个地方挖掘出远界的力量。",
	"Lottie would totally love to save the world, but she's in the middle of a retreat and completely busy. It's a lot of work keeping all these liches happy.": "洛蒂很想拯救世界，但她正在闭关修炼，完全是在忙。要让所有这些地衣都高兴起来，这可是个大工程。",
	"When the characters have learned all you want them to (or if they start to get the upper hand against the {@creature clockwork behir|OoW}), Lottie ends the conversation by saying, \"Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I have an appointment. I must go. Have fun dying!\" Her illusion then fades.": "当人物学到了你想让他们学到的一切（或者如果他们开始对{@creature clockwork behir|OoW}占了上风），洛蒂以说 \"哦，我非常抱歉 \"结束对话。我有个约会。我必须走了。祝你死得愉快！\" 然后她的幻觉就消失了。",
	"Talking to Lottie and not getting killed is the major point of this area. But characters who defeat the behir can remove the panels to access the clockwork machinery here. With a little experimentation, characters can deactivate any of the machinery in the casino, including the locks on the double doors into area 6. At your determination, tearing down the panels and attacking the clockwork behind them can have the same effect.": "与Lottie交谈并不被杀死是这个区域的主要内容。但打败贝希尔的角色可以拆除面板，进入这里的发条机械。只要稍加试验，人物就可以解除赌场中的任何机械，包括进入第6区的双门上的锁。根据你的判断，拆掉面板并攻击面板后面的发条可以产生同样的效果。",
	"The double doors to this huge chamber are covered in clockwork that functions as a lock. A successful DC 20 Dexterity check using jeweler's tools or thieves' tools unlocks the door. The characters can also open the doors from the machine room, or can use the kitchen to access this area. The skeleton staff in the front areas of the casino assume that anyone entering Lottie's private domain is either invited or is soon to be dead, and pay no mind to characters breaking in.": "这个巨大的房间的双门被覆盖在发条上，可以作为锁使用。使用珠宝商的工具或盗贼的工具，成功地进行DC20的灵巧检查，就可以打开门锁。角色们也可以从机房打开门，或者通过厨房进入这个区域。赌场前台的骷髅工作人员认为，任何进入洛蒂私人领地的人要么是被邀请的，要么是即将死去的，因此对闯入的人物毫不在意。",
	"The floor of this room is covered in red tiles surrounding a large swimming pool, the bottom of which glitters with thousands of gems. Fountains around the room spray water into the air that hangs as a fine mist.": "这个房间的地板上铺着红色瓷砖，围绕着一个大游泳池，池底闪烁着成千上万的宝石。房间周围的喷泉向空中喷水，水雾弥漫。",

	"This area can also contain other information of your choosing about the Six or the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}.

Some of them are even alive.": "当你走近时，大型发条双门自行打开，露出一个装饰着精美艺术品、丰富地毯、几张皮沙发和一张会议室桌子的豪华房间。房间周围基座上的水晶球闪烁着光芒，一个巨大的鱼缸里聚集着不寻常的生物。其中一些甚至是活的。",
	"Nine liches occupy the room, either lounging around or arguing at the table. All wear leisure suits or sun dresses, including one sitting comfortably with a dog in her lap. All appear surprised to see you.": "九个地衣占据了这个房间，有的在闲逛，有的在桌前争论。所有的人都穿着休闲服或太阳裙，包括一个舒适地坐着，腿上放着一只狗。所有人看到你都显得很惊讶。",
	"If the characters haven't encountered the illusory Lottie in {@area area 5|290|x}, the revelations in that section can be moved here, revealed by Lottie or the other liches. Some of the other liches have heard rumors of the Six's plots, and that the Six have seemingly bargained with terrible powers to learn how to use the orrery components to open a portal to the Far Realm. The commercial interests of these liches means that all understand how destroying the world is bad for business, so the Six must be stopped.": "如果角色们没有在{@area area 5|290|x}中遇到虚幻的洛蒂，那么该部分的启示可以移到这里，由洛蒂或其他地衣揭示。其他一些地衣听说了关于六人组阴谋的传闻，六人组似乎与可怕的力量讨价还价，以学习如何使用矿石组件来打开通往远界的入口。这些地衣的商业利益意味着他们都明白，破坏世界对商业是不利的，所以必须阻止六人组。",
	"The bored liches' thirst for entertainment might inspire them to ask the characters about what they do—and about Acquisitions Incorporated. Like Lottie, all these undead are focused on the limitless commercial aspects of immortal evil, and might be talked into partnerships with the franchise. The potential for such deals (and the potential risks in dealing with such powerful entities) is left to your imagination.": "无聊的地衣们对娱乐的渴求可能会激发他们去询问这些人物的工作，以及关于收购公司的情况。像洛蒂一样，所有这些亡灵都专注于不朽的邪恶的无限商业方面，并可能被说服与专营权合作。这种交易的潜力（以及与这种强大实体打交道的潜在风险）留给你想象。",
	"Depending on how their dealings with the liches go (and whether they did any damage to Lottie's Palace while getting to her), the characters can spend a few hours hanging out with the undead. Any prospective business dealings can be lined up, after which the liches order one last round of drinks, then kick the characters out of Lottie's Palace.": "根据他们与地衣的交易情况（以及他们在接近洛蒂宫时是否对她造成了任何损害），角色们可以花几个小时与亡灵们一起玩耍。任何潜在的商业交易都可以排上日程，之后地衣们会点上最后一轮酒，然后把角色们赶出洛蒂的宫殿。",
	"With the events of this episode complete, the characters attain 6th level! Leaving Lottie's Palace behind, they can return safely to their borrowed {@vehicle battle balloon|AI} or mobile headquarters, ready to try to figure out where the Six might be conducting their ritual—and how to stop it.": "随着本集事件的完成，人物达到了第6级！他们可以安全地回到他们的借来的{@vehicle battle balloon|AI}或移动总部。离开洛蒂的宫殿，他们可以安全地回到他们借来的{@vehicle battle balloon|AI}或移动总部，准备尝试找出六人帮可能正在进行仪式的地方，以及如何阻止它。",
	"Much of the break between episode 5 and 6 will be focused on determining the location of the Six's ritual site. The key clue to doing so is knowing that the ritual needs to be undertaken in a location where the planar boundaries are already thin, and where an existing planar portal is likely already in operation. Still, though the end of the world might be nigh, on the off chance that the characters are successful in stopping the Six's plans, they'll have bills to pay.": "第五集和第六集之间的大部分休息时间将集中在确定六人组的仪式地点上。这样做的关键线索是知道仪式需要在一个平面边界已经很薄的地方进行，而且现有的平面门户很可能已经在运行。尽管如此，尽管世界末日可能已经临近，但如果角色们成功地阻止了六人帮的计划，他们就会有账单需要支付。",
	"As the endgame approaches, the time the characters have spent with the orrery and its component pieces can grant the necessary insight to build a detector that can sense portals or planar disturbances. A portalometer, if you will. The research or scrutineering activities can help the characters uncover the necessary information or tools, while the crafting a magic item activity can cover the construction of the portalometer.": "随着终局的临近，角色们与口轮及其部件相处的时间可以赋予他们必要的洞察力，以建立一个可以感知门户或平面干扰的探测器。如果你愿意的话，可以说是一个传送门仪。研究或检查活动可以帮助人物发现必要的信息或工具，而制作魔法物品的活动可以涵盖传送门仪的建造。",
	"The details of the portalometer are left to the imaginations of the players (including coming up with a better name if they like). The detector might take the form of a magical receptacle allowing one or more orrery components to function as a compass, a divination window tapping into planar disruptions to show brief glimpses of possible locations, or any other device channeling suitable magic.": "门户仪的细节留给玩家想象（包括想出一个更好的名字，如果他们喜欢）。探测器的形式可以是一个神奇的容器，允许一个或多个轨道组件作为指南针使用；一个占卜窗口，用于探测平面干扰，以显示可能的地点的简短一瞥；或者任何其他引导适当魔法的装置。",
	"If you really want to dig deep, you could experiment with the idea that the orrery's power gives it a kind of consciousness (or you could even make it a sentient magic item, as detailed in {@book chapter 7|DMG|-1} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}.) In that scenario, the orrery's consciousness might be what the portalometer taps into. Or the orrery components possessed by the Six might begin to call to the components held by the characters, as the artifact seeks to be made whole once more.": "如果你真的想深入研究的话，你可以尝试一下这样的想法：口轮的力量给了它一种意识（或者你甚至可以把它变成一个有意识的魔法物品，就像(%%)中详述的那样。在这种情况下，口簧管的意识可能就是传送门仪所接触到的东西。或者，六人组拥有的箭塔组件可能会开始呼唤人物所拥有的组件，因为这个神器想要再次成为一个整体。",
	"The time necessary to locate the ritual site is left to your determination. If the characters are anxious to cut to the chase, you can have a successfully created portalometer lead them straight to the site. In a pinch, you could even say that any orrery components the characters still possess become attuned to the ritual as Splugoth prepares it, allowing the characters to triangulate the ritual site's location. For more build up, you can set up a search involving side treks, which might cover the length and breadth of the Sword Coast as the characters make use of their mobile franchise headquarters.": "找到祭祀地点所需的时间由你决定。如果角色们急于直奔主题，你可以让一个成功创建的传送门引导他们直接到达现场。在紧要关头，你甚至可以说，在斯普鲁戈斯准备仪式的时候，角色们仍然拥有的任何ORRERY组件都会与仪式相适应，从而使角色们能够确定仪式地点的三角位置。为了更多的积累，你可以设置一个涉及到侧面跋涉的搜索，当人物利用他们的移动特许经营总部时，可能会覆盖剑海岸的长度和广度。",
	"These side trek missions might tie in to improving the magic of the portalometer and involving tracking down lore or components. Or the characters could discover several possible locations for the Six's ritual, then investigate and eliminate false leads before finding the real site. One such side trek is detailed in \"{@area The Moon Glade|2b0|x}\" in {@adventure episode 6|OoW|6}, and you can add similar events as you wish.": "这些侧面的跋涉任务可能与提高传送门计的魔力有关，并涉及追踪传说或组件。或者人物可以发现六人组仪式的几个可能地点，然后在找到真正的地点之前进行调查并排除错误的线索。在(%%)的\"{@area The Moon Glade|2b0|x} \"中详细介绍了一个这样的侧翼跋涉，你可以根据自己的意愿添加类似的事件。",
	"Any number of downtime and franchise activities—from research to schmoozing to shady business practices—can be used by characters seeking to learn more about the ritual or how best to take the fight to the Six. For any tasks in which the outcome includes a complication due to a rival, the Six could be attempting to undermine the characters' franchise to eliminate their threat.": "任何数量的停工和特许经营活动--从研究到讨好到阴暗的商业行为--都可以被寻求了解更多关于仪式或如何最好地与六人帮作战的角色所利用。在任何任务中，如果结果包括因对手而产生的复杂情况，六人帮可能试图破坏人物的特许经营权，以消除他们的威胁。",
	"Even as the characters are working on locating the ritual site, they might use the explore territory franchise activity to interact with local customers and allies to strengthen the franchise. A group of merchants might want to sell branded gear manufactured by the liches the characters met at Lottie's, creating additional business opportunities or allowing the characters to follow up on previous negotiations with the liches.": "即使人物在努力寻找祭祀地点，他们也可以利用探索领土的特许经营活动，与当地的客户和盟友互动，以加强特许经营。一群商人可能想出售他们在Lottie's遇到的地衣制造的品牌装备，从而创造更多的商业机会，或者让人物继续跟进之前与地衣的谈判。",
	"Having recently interacted with several powerful organizations—including Lottie's lich alliance, the Six, and Dran Enterprises—the characters might be bursting with ideas for fine-tuning their franchise and headquarters before the final showdown. This might involve organizational restructuring, headquarters modifications, upgraded magic, and other activities meant to grant the franchise an edge in the coming fight.": "最近与几个强大的组织--包括洛蒂的巫师联盟、六人帮和德兰企业--互动后，人物可能会在最后的决战前迸发出微调其特许经营权和总部的想法。这可能涉及到组织结构的重组、总部的修改、魔法的升级，以及其他旨在为特许经营权在即将到来的战斗中提供优势的活动。",
	"Engaging in shady business practices or outright crime during downtime might result in more than financial reward for the characters. With a suitable degree of success, such activities can bring the characters into contact with agents of the Six. Likewise, the characters might use the cover of criminal activity to infiltrate or expose the Six, or they could use carousing or other social activities to contact an ally or operative of the organization.": "在停工期间从事不正当的商业行为或公然犯罪，可能会给人物带来比经济回报更多的好处。如果成功的话，这些活动可以使人物与六人帮的特工接触。同样地，人物可以利用犯罪活动的掩护来渗透或暴露六人帮，或者他们可以利用狂欢或其他社交活动来联系该组织的盟友或行动者。",
	"Any such interactions should automatically create complications to be resolved, with those complications revealing useful information concerning the Six's plots, the ritual site's possible location, and the defenses around the site.": "任何这样的互动都会自动产生需要解决的复杂问题，而这些复杂问题会揭示出有关六人组的情节、仪式地点的可能位置以及该地点周围的防御的有用信息。",
	"If the characters communicate with Head Office at any point during their downtime, it should be made clear that Acquisitions Incorporated is impressed by the franchise's success. Omin Dran does whatever he can to backstop the characters' efforts to find the ritual site, even as he directs other franchises and operatives to seek the site as well. (In the end, the characters will conveniently be the ones to locate the ritual site, but it should be clear that the entire organization takes the impending end of the world as seriously as they do.)": "如果角色们在停工期间的任何时候与总部沟通，应该明确指出收购公司对特许经营的成功印象深刻。奥明-德兰尽其所能地支持人物寻找仪式地点的努力，甚至他还指示其他专营机构和特工人员也要寻找该地点。(最后，这些人物将很方便地找到仪式地点，但应该清楚的是，整个组织对即将到来的世界末日和他们一样认真对待）。",
	"After a suitable amount of questing and research, the characters locate the ritual site, which they learn is in the small town of Red Larch. That settlement is the childhood home of Omin Dran and the stomping grounds of the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise known as the \"C\" Team, whose members have recently gone missing.": "经过适量的探索和研究，这些人物找到了仪式的地点，他们了解到这是在红落叶小镇上。该镇是奥明-德兰的童年故乡，也是被称为 \"C \"小组的收购公司的活动场所，其成员最近失踪了。",
	"The characters speed toward Red Larch, where they find foes allied with the Six guarding the Dran & Courtier inn. That otherwise quiet establishment has always possessed unusual magical qualities, but these have been warped by the slowly opening portal to the Far Realm. The characters can interact with the local townsfolk, learning that the members of the \"C\" Team entered the inn but have not returned. Likewise, the inn's co-owner and proprietor, Propha Dran, has not been seen since the planar strangeness suffusing the inn started.": "角色们飞快地朝红落叶松走去，在那里他们发现了与六人帮结盟的敌人在守卫德兰和库蒂尔旅馆。这家安静的旅馆一直拥有不寻常的魔力，但这些魔力已经被慢慢打开的通往远方世界的门户扭曲了。角色可以与当地居民互动，了解到 \"C \"小组的成员进入了旅馆，但还没有回来。同样地，旅馆的共同拥有者和经营者普罗帕德兰，自从弥漫在旅馆中的平面怪异现象开始，就再也没有出现过。",
	"When the characters enter, the Dran & Courtier appears normal at first. But opening any of its interior doors causes the entire site to transform under the watchful eye of an agent of the Six known as the Keymaster. A nightmare version of the Dran & Courtier is revealed, filled with aberrant horrors. Defeating the horrors of this incarnation of the inn returns the characters to the actual inn.": "当人物进入时，Dran & Courtier起初看起来很正常。但打开任何一扇内部的门，都会使整个场所在被称为 \"钥匙主人 \"的六人组特工的监视下发生变化。一个噩梦般的Dran & Courtier出现了，充满了反常的恐怖。打败这个旅店的恐怖，人物就会回到真正的旅店。",
	"A second transformation turns the characters into miniature heroes as they are greeted by Splugoth the Returned. On behalf of the Six, the wily goblin asks the characters to surrender their orrery components—and then releases {@creature Onyx|OoW}, the giant (relative to the characters) inn's cat, upon them. Successfully fleeing from {@creature Onyx|OoW} transforms the inn once more.": "第二次变身后，人物变成了微型英雄，迎接他们的是 \"回归者 \"斯普鲁戈斯。这个狡猾的小妖精代表六人组，要求角色交出他们的魔法阵部件--然后释放出{@creature Onyx|OoW}，这只巨大的（相对于角色而言）旅馆的猫，来对付他们。成功逃离{@creature Onyx|OoW}后，客栈再次发生变化。",
	"In the final stage, the characters discover the members of the \"C\" Team fallen in combat and must fight the horrid Far Realm creature that slew them. Doing so brings those NPC heroes back to life. Once the Keymaster has been subsequently bested, the characters can open a final door leading to a dark series of dimensional caverns—and the lair of an ancient deep crow. That terrible creature is sure to defeat the characters, unless they can determine that it's suffering from a deep depression and desperately seeks a mate. Successfully playing the part of deep crow relationship counselor allows the characters to continue on, finally reaching the portal site.": "在最后阶段，角色们发现 \"C \"队的成员在战斗中倒下，必须与杀死他们的可怕的远界生物战斗。这样做可以使这些NPC英雄复活。一旦钥匙主人随后被击败，角色们就可以打开最后一扇门，通往一系列黑暗的维度洞穴--以及一个古老的深海乌鸦的巢穴。那个可怕的生物肯定会打败角色，除非他们能确定它正遭受深度抑郁症的折磨，并急切地寻找伴侣。成功扮演深海乌鸦关系顾问的角色，可以让人物继续前进，最终到达传送门地点。",
	"Splugoth is in control of the ritual and has defenses in place to prevent the meddling characters from thwarting his plans. As the characters face off against a mutated Far Realm goblin horde, Splugoth's control of the orrery components that fuel the ritual lets him summon forth twisted, evil versions of some of Acquisitions Incorporated's most famous members. Oh, and there's a thing where the ritual keeps resurrecting Splugoth every time the characters kill him.": "斯普鲁哥特控制着仪式，并有防御措施来防止爱管闲事的人物挫败他的计划。当角色们面对变异的远界地精部落时，Splugoth对助长仪式的火炉组件的控制让他召唤出了一些收购公司最有名的成员的扭曲、邪恶版本。哦，还有一件事，那就是每次人物杀死斯普鲁哥斯时，仪式都会让他复活。",
	"In the end, clever thinking and a measure of luck might allow the heroes to keep Splugoth dead, seize control of the orrery components, and end the ritual. If victorious, the characters will earn accolades from Head Office for a job well done!": "最后，聪明的思维和一定程度的运气可能会让英雄们保持斯普鲁戈斯的死亡，夺取对神庙部件的控制权，并结束仪式。如果获得胜利，这些人物将因出色的工作而获得总部的嘉奖",
	"And the world will be safe from destruction. That's always a plus.": "而且世界将免遭破坏。这始终是一个优点。",
	"In the course of locating the ritual site (see \"{@area Franchise Downtime|2a1|x}\" in {@adventure episode 5|OoW|5}), the characters might travel to any number of locations, either to confirm that those locations are not the ritual site or to gain additional information or magic useful in the search for the real site. If you want to set up a prolonged search for the site, any of the following iconic locations along the Sword Coast might make an interesting stop for the characters. Each location offers the potential to gain information regarding sites known for planar disturbances or strange magic, or to seek lore and materials to refine the operation of the characters' portalometer.": "在寻找仪式地点的过程中（见{@adventure episode 5|OoW|5}中的\"{@area Franchise Downtime|2a1|x}\"），人物可能会前往任何数量的地点，要么确认这些地点不是仪式地点，要么获得额外的信息或对寻找真正地点有用的魔法。如果你想设置一个长期的寻找地点的过程，以下任何一个沿剑海岸的标志性地点都可能成为角色们有趣的一站。每个地方都有可能获得有关已知的平面干扰或奇怪的魔法的信息，或者寻找传说和材料来完善人物的传送门仪的操作。",
	"The many towers of the largest and most storied library in all Faerûn are the perfect place to search for clues leading to the location or nature of the ritual site, or to find instructions for crafting a portalometer. Gaining lore or befriending the monks of the library could reveal that someone else recently came to Candlekeep to inquire into the nature of portals to other dimensions. In fact, this representative of the Six was studying the very tomes the characters are now investigating!": "全法鲁恩最大、最富盛名的图书馆的许多塔楼，是寻找通往仪式地点或性质的线索，或寻找制作传送门仪的说明的最佳场所。获得传说或与图书馆的僧侣交好，可以发现最近还有人来到烛台镇，探究通往其他空间的传送门的本质。事实上，这位六人组的代表正在研究人物现在正在调查的那些书！他的名字是 \"六人组\"。",

	"Depending on how much time the characters spent in Neverwinter in {@adventure episode 3|OoW|3}, they might have heard tales of how the Spellplague (the great magical devastation that tore across Faerûn more than a century ago) tore a large chasm through the city. This chasm (helpfully known as \"the Chasm\") has since been sealed, but pockets of blue spellfire and the warping effects of planar energy can often still be seen in the area.": "根据人物在永夜城度过的时间{@adventure episode 3|OoW|3}，他们可能听说过法术瘟疫（一个多世纪前横扫法鲁恩的巨大魔法破坏）是如何在城市中撕开一条巨大的鸿沟的故事。这条鸿沟（被称为 \"鸿沟\"）后来被封住了，但在该地区仍然可以看到一些蓝色的法术之火和平面能量的扭曲效应。",
	"The characters can make use of contacts from {@adventure episode 3|OoW|3} to determine that agents of the Six appeared recently in Neverwinter and were rumored to have been researching the magic of the Chasm. Tracking down any agents who remain might allow the characters to gain hints regarding the ritual's location. You might also decide that these Six agents have been warped by the latent energy of the Chasm, making them formidable and unpredictable foes.": "角色可以利用{@adventure episode 3|OoW|3}的联系人，确定六人帮的特工最近出现在永夜城，据传他们一直在研究鸿沟的魔法。追踪任何留下的特工可能会让角色获得关于仪式地点的提示。你也可以决定，这些六人组特工已经被鸿沟的潜在能量所扭曲，使他们成为可怕的、不可预测的敌人。",

The pool is surrounded by a circle of huge standing stones, all inscribed with strange writing.": "月亮谷是一块僻静的空地，直径大约八十英尺，其中一半的空间被中心的水潭占据了。周围巨大的古树高耸入云，只允许狭长的天空照亮水池的银色表面。池子周围有一圈巨大的立石，上面都刻着奇怪的文字。",
	"Anyone able to read Druidic can read the writing on the stones, all of which makes reference to divination and magic. The stones of the pool were brought here by visiting druids using large beasts or magical transportation, but any magic they might possess is dormant during this encounter.": "任何能读懂德鲁伊语的人都能读懂石头上的文字，这些文字都提到了占卜和魔法。池子里的石头是由来访的德鲁伊用大型野兽或魔法运输工具带到这里的，但他们可能拥有的任何魔法在这次遭遇中都处于休眠状态。",
	"Garalel initiates combat by animating trees, following up with her Glimpse of the Beyond feature. Characters can see that her bark is covered in dark, foul-smelling moss. A successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Nature}) check identifies the bark as magically tainted. Dealing damage to Garalel harms her but also breaks off large pieces of the tainted bark and moss. When she is reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, enough corrupted bark has been sloughed off that the treant regains her senses and stops fighting.": "加拉里尔通过使树木生动化来发起战斗，然后用她的 \"瞥见外面 \"的功能进行跟进。角色可以看到她的树皮上覆盖着黑暗、恶臭的苔藓。成功通过DC12智力（{@skill Arcana}或{@skill Nature}）检查，就可以确定树皮是被魔法污染的。对Garalel造成的伤害会使她受伤，但也会使受污染的树皮和苔藓大块脱落。当她的生命值减少到30点或更少时，已经有足够多的腐败树皮被剥离，树人恢复了她的感觉并停止战斗。",
	"A character can also use an action to throw water from the pool onto Garalel. Each time she is splashed so, it helps cleanse the dark magic binding her and increases the hit point total at which she regains her senses by 10.": "一个角色也可以用一个动作将池子里的水扔到加拉里尔身上。每次她被这样泼水，都有助于净化束缚她的黑暗魔法，并使她恢复感觉时的总命中率增加10。",
	"If Garalel regains her senses, she apologizes profusely. She allows the characters to approach the pool and tells them how the members of the Six used its waters to determine the ideal location for a dark ritual. Knowing that their actions contaminated the pool, she drew that corruption into herself instead.": "如果加勒尔恢复了理智，她会深深地道歉。她允许人物接近水池，并告诉他们六人帮成员如何利用水池的水来确定举行黑暗仪式的理想地点。她知道他们的行为污染了池子，所以她把这种腐败引向了自己。",
	"What the characters get out of this side trek depends on where it fits in the longer process of perfecting a portalometer or eliminating possible ritual sites. Depending on the goal, Garalel can allow the characters to use the pool's divination power to seek the ritual site, to take a sample of the glade's magical waters for use in their portalometer, or what have you.": "角色们从这次旅行中得到什么，取决于它在完善传送门仪或消除可能的仪式地点的长期过程中的位置。根据目标的不同，加拉尔可以允许角色使用水池的占卜能力来寻找仪式地点，或者取用绿地的魔水样本来用于他们的传送门计，或者其他什么。",
	"At whatever point in the search process you deem appropriate, the characters narrow down the search for the ritual site to a final location: the settlement of Red Larch on the western side of the Dessarin Valley. This small town services passing caravans and has a large quarry from which local folk mine marble favored by the wealthy of Waterdeep. A wagon can reach Waterdeep from Red Larch in seven days, and the town of Phandalin is six days away on foot.": "在你认为合适的搜索过程中，角色们将寻找祭祀地点的范围缩小到了最后一个地点：德萨林谷西侧的红落叶松定居点。这个小镇为过往的商队提供服务，并有一个大型采石场，当地人在那里开采沃特德普富人喜欢的大理石。一辆马车可以在七天内从红松镇到达沃特德，而步行到范达林镇需要六天。",
	"Red Larch is also the hometown of Omin Dran and the location of the Dran family business—the Dran & Courtier inn and restaurant. As the characters soon discover, this is not a coincidence. The {@adventure Princes of the Apocalypse|PotA} adventure contains more information on Red Larch and the surrounding region. As with Phandalin, this version of Red Larch is set about five years later than that earlier adventure.": "红落叶松也是奥明-德兰的故乡，也是德兰家族生意的所在地--德兰和库蒂尔旅馆和餐馆。正如角色们很快发现的那样，这并不是一个巧合。{@adventure Princes of the Apocalypse|PotA}冒险包含了更多关于红落叶松和周围地区的信息。与范达林一样，这个版本的红落叶松的背景比早期的冒险要晚五年左右。",
	"How the characters arrive in Red Larch is likely determined by what they suspect or have learned regarding the defenses the Six have set up around the ritual. They might choose a stealthy incursion in the dead of night, to roar straight in aboard a mobile franchise headquarters at midday, or any approach in between. But however they first enter the town, the characters quickly confirm that the Six's ritual is already underway.": "角色如何到达红叶松，可能取决于他们对六人帮在仪式周围设置的防御措施的怀疑或了解。他们可能会选择在夜深人静时隐秘地入侵，也可能在正午时分乘坐移动的特许经营总部直接进入，或者采取两者之间的任何方法。但无论他们第一次进入小镇，角色们都会很快确认六人帮的仪式已经开始了。",
	"Something is seriously wrong in Red Larch. The Dran & Courtier inn can be seen at the crossroads near the center of town easily enough. But the beams of purple energy emanating from the establishment are decidedly unusual, as is the presence of frightened townsfolk corralled in a pen nearby. Then, of course, there's the small force of bugbears guarding the pen and the gnolls surrounding the inn. That doesn't look right at all.": "红落叶城出了严重的问题。在镇中心附近的十字路口，很容易就能看到 \"德兰与库蒂尔 \"旅馆。但是，从旅馆里发出的紫色能量束显然是不寻常的，就像附近的围栏里有受惊的镇民一样。然后，当然，还有守卫围栏的一小队虫族和包围旅馆的地精。这看起来一点都不对。",
	"Haeleeya is glad to hand the characters her captive bugbear, which is happy to tell the characters everything it knows in exchange for staying alive. It tells how the bugbears were employed by the Six and ordered to round up twenty captives in case the Six needed them for some ritual, though it knows nothing more than that.": "Haeleeya很高兴地把她俘虏的虫子交给这些人物，虫子很高兴地告诉这些人物它所知道的一切，以换取他们的生命。它讲述了虫熊是如何被六人帮雇佣的，并被命令围捕20名俘虏，以备六人帮需要他们进行某种仪式，不过它知道的也就只有这些了。",
	"As you draw closer, you see the sign marking the Dran & Courtier swinging slowly despite the absence of any breeze. Purple light continues to seep out through roof tiles, shuttered windows, and the closed front door.": "当你走近时，你看到尽管没有任何微风，标志着Dran & Courtier的招牌仍在缓慢摆动。紫色的光线继续从屋顶的瓦片、百叶窗和紧闭的前门中渗出。",
	"Even in daylight, the building is shrouded by shadows, as if every part of the inn is somehow in the shade. Ringing the building are twenty {@creature Gnoll||gnolls}, arranged in four packs of five. Even the fearless gnolls are weirded out by the strange lights emanating from the inn. The characters can engage the gnolls head-on or attempt to take them out stealthily. Because the mercenaries are on edge, they can be easily distracted by a fire, recruiting NPCs to draw them off, illusions, or other clever strategies.": "即使在白天，这座建筑也被阴影所笼罩，仿佛客栈的每个部分都在某种程度上处于阴暗之中。环绕建筑的是20个{@creature Gnoll||gnolls}，五人一组，排列成四组。即使是无畏的地精也被客栈里发出的奇怪灯光吓到了。人物可以与地精正面交锋，也可以尝试隐蔽地干掉它们。因为佣兵们都很紧张，所以他们可以很容易地被火引开，招募NPC来引开他们，用幻觉或其他聪明的策略。",
	"Once the gnolls have been dealt with, the characters are free to enter the Dran & Courtier. The incursion of the inn and restaurant plays out as four distinct stages, each channeling a unique version of the establishment—and forcing the characters to face off against the effects of the dark magic churning within.": "一旦解决了地精，人物就可以自由地进入德兰和库蒂尔。对旅店和餐馆的入侵分为四个不同的阶段，每个阶段都有一个独特的场所--迫使角色们面对内部汹涌的黑暗魔法的影响。",
	"The Dran & Courtier is normally a fine inn run by Prophetess \"Propha\" Dran, who happens to be Omin Dran's mother, and her wife, Audra Courtier. The inn is a favorite of locals and travelers alike, but it also serves another purpose. When someone carrying an acorn whose cap is dipped in gold (usually given to them by Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office) passes through the door, they end up in an extradimensional version of the inn known as the Test Market.": "德兰和库蒂尔通常是一家精致的客栈，由女先知 \"普罗帕 \"德兰（恰好是奥明-德兰的母亲）和她的妻子奥德拉-库蒂尔经营。这家旅馆是当地人和旅行者的最爱，但它也有另一个目的。当有人带着一个帽子上沾满金子的橡子（通常是由收购公司总部给他们的）经过这扇门时，他们最终会进入一个被称为 \"测试市场 \"的超维度的客栈。",
	"The Test Market is meant to test new recruits to Acquisitions Incorporated, and it has several known versions. The multifaceted extradimensional nature of the Dran & Courtier makes it an ideal location for the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} to channel the extraplanar magic of the Six's ritual. A convenient number of days before the characters discovered the portal site, Splugoth accessed the extradimensional space and began the process of opening the portal. Energy from the Far Realm has infused several versions of the Test Market, making them even more dangerous than usual—including one version that has already defeated the \"C\" Team.": "测试市场是为了测试收购公司的新员工，它有几个已知的版本。德兰与库尔蒂尔的多面性使其成为{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}引导六人组仪式的星外魔法的理想地点。在人物发现传送门地点的方便几天前，斯普鲁戈斯进入了超维空间，开始了打开传送门的过程。来自远界的能量注入了几个版本的测试市场，使它们比平时更加危险--包括一个已经击败了 \"C \"小组的版本。",
	"Map 6.1 shows the layout of this episode's Test Market versions of the Dran & Courtier.": "地图6.1显示了本集《德兰与库尔蒂亚》测试市场版本的布局。",
	"One of the seemingly ordinary inhabitants of the inn is an agent of the Six. Known as the Keymaster, the agent is a {@creature doppelganger} presently posing as Prophetess \"Propha\" Dran (see {@area area 3|2cb|x}). The doppelganger holds a portal key that allows it to select which version of the Test Market the characters access when they open one of the inn's interior doors. It does so in the hope of destroying anyone attempting to interfere with Splugoth's ritual.": "旅店里的一个看似普通的居民是六人帮的一个特工。这名特工被称为 \"钥匙主人\"，是一个{@creature doppelganger}目前冒充先知 \"普罗帕 \"德兰的人（见{@area area 3|2cb|x}）。这个二重身持有一把传送门钥匙，当人物打开旅馆的内部大门时，它可以选择进入哪个版本的测试市场。它这样做是希望摧毁任何试图干扰斯普鲁哥斯仪式的人。",
	"The Keymaster runs the characters through new versions of the warped Test Market until its identity is discovered. Once caught, the Keymaster can be forced to open the inn's basement door—revealing the dimensional caverns leading to the ritual site.": "钥匙主人通过新版本的扭曲的测试市场让角色们运行，直到发现其身份。一旦被抓住，钥匙主人就会被迫打开旅馆的地下室大门--揭开通往仪式现场的维度洞穴。",
	"Until the characters confront the Keymaster, they advance to the next stage of the Test Market every time they open a door within the default version of the inn. Opened doors remain open, so the characters can explore the rooms beyond when they return from whatever stage is triggered by opening the door. Any treasure or other objects claimed in a stage stay with the characters.": "在人物面对钥匙主人之前，每当他们在默认版本的旅馆中打开一扇门，就会进入测试市场的下一个阶段。被打开的门仍然是开放的，所以当他们从打开门所触发的任何阶段返回时，他们可以探索后面的房间。在一个阶段中获得的任何财宝或其他物品都会留在人物身上。",
	"The Test Market is not advanced when NPCs open the doors, since the Keymaster has control of the inn's magic. As such, the NPCs stuck in the main stage (see below) wander around the inn as they please. If calculating characters think to have an NPC open a door for them, it advances the Test Market to the next stage for them only, plus any NPCs that appear in the next stage.": "当NPC打开门时，测试市场并不先进，因为钥匙主人控制着旅馆的魔法。因此，卡在主舞台上的NPC（见下文）在客栈里随意游荡。如果计算中的人物想到让NPC为他们开门，就会使测试市场推进到下一阶段，只为他们，加上下一阶段出现的任何NPC。",
	"Stop by the Dran & Courtier if you're ever in Red Larch. In late summer, preferably. Come hungry.": "如果你在红落叶山，请到德兰和库尔蒂尔餐厅来。最好是在夏末。饿着肚子来吧。",
	"The inn's windows, chimneys, and other access points are all magically sealed. They cannot be opened from inside or out, and are impervious to spells and damage. The main door opens easily, but a wall of purple light blocks the view inside. Characters must step through the door to take stock of what lies beyond.": "旅店的窗户、烟囱和其他通道都被魔法密封。它们不能从里面或外面打开，而且不受法术和损害的影响。大门很容易打开，但一堵紫色的光墙挡住了里面的视野。角色必须穿过这扇门，才能看到门外的情况。",
	"The door of the Dran & Courtier is neither locked nor trapped—though the building emanates strange sounds, shakes as though it's falling apart, and continues to radiate a strange purple energy. As soon as you step through the door, though, all the strangeness stops.": "Dran & Courtier的门既没有上锁，也没有被困住--尽管这栋建筑发出奇怪的声音，摇晃得好像要散架一样，并持续散发着一种奇怪的紫色能量。不过，当你踏进这扇门时，所有的怪异都停止了。",
	"You see a perfectly ordinary inn, its common room featuring five round tables. Two of those tables are occupied by typical patrons, while two other people stand at the bar. A sleek house cat sizes you up as it paces across the floor, stalking some unseen prey. Oddly, the interior space of the inn seems slightly out of sync with the exterior—almost as if you've stepped into somewhere else. But even as you ponder this, the front door closes behind you, and you notice everyone in the inn glance your way expectantly.": "你看到一家非常普通的旅馆，它的公共房间里有五张圆桌。其中两张桌子被典型的顾客占据，而另外两个人站在吧台前。一只光滑的家猫在地板上踱来踱去，盯着一些看不见的猎物，对你进行观察。奇怪的是，旅店的内部空间似乎与外部空间略微不协调--几乎就像你走进了别的地方。但就在你思考这个问题时，前门在你身后关上了，你注意到旅店里的每个人都期待地朝你这边看。",
	"The door closes behind the characters as soon as they are all inside. Powerful magic imbued into the door makes it impossible to hold it open, as it pushes anything blocking it out of the way. Characters attempting to hold the door become suddenly distracted, unable to remember why they were doing so. Characters who refuse to enter the inn feel oddly compelled to move forward. Just get everyone inside. You'll make it work.": "当人物都在里面时，门就会在他们身后关闭。灌注在门里的强大魔法使人无法把门打开，因为它把任何阻挡它的东西都推开了。试图守住门的人物突然变得心烦意乱，不记得他们为什么要这样做。拒绝进入旅店的角色感到奇怪，不得不向前走。只要让大家进去。你会成功的。",
	"Once closed, the door cannot be opened or damaged. Teleportation and other modes of extradimensional travel fail in the Dran & Courtier, and magic cannot be used to view or communicate with the outside world.": "一旦关闭，这扇门就不能被打开或损坏。在德兰与库尔蒂尔中，传送和其他维度外的旅行模式都失败了，而且不能用魔法来查看或与外界交流。",
	"If the characters open any of the interior doors of the Dran & Courtier, it advances the Test Market to the next stage.

	"Two male humans are quietly eating a meal at one of the common room tables, while a young male and female human and an elderly female human sit at another. A fireplace occupies the corner closest to the door, burning brightly, and a chandelier above the common room provides additional light from its tall candles. Hanging over the fireplace is a portrait of three children, two female and one male. The male is clearly a young Omin Dran.": "两名男性人类正在休息室的一张桌子上安静地吃着饭，而一名年轻的男性和女性人类以及一名年长的女性人类坐在另一张桌子上。一个壁炉占据了离门最近的角落，燃烧得很旺盛，公共房间上方的吊灯用高大的蜡烛提供了额外的光线。挂在壁炉上的是三个孩子的画像，两个女性和一个男性。男性显然是一个年轻的奥明德兰。",
	"Next to the fireplace is an unoccupied raised stage where a bard might strike up a tune. The bar is to your left, where a half-elf in a heavy leather duster receives a drink from a tall female elf wearing a gold medallion. Stairs beyond the bar lead up to a balcony on the second floor. Eight doors along the open upstairs hallways likely lead to bedrooms.": "壁炉旁边是一个无人的高台，一个吟游诗人可能会在那里弹奏一曲。吧台在你的左边，一个穿着厚重的皮革掸子的半精灵在那里从一个戴着金质奖章的高个子女精灵手中接过饮料。酒吧外的楼梯通向二楼的一个阳台。沿着楼上开放的走廊，有八扇门可能通向卧室。",

They have seen a number of strange, shady people coming and going, including some who wore cloaks to conceal their features. The doors seemed to work for those people. They suggest speaking to Propha, the barkeep and owner, who always appears to be trying to remember something.": "任何通过争论的人都可以了解到，这两个人有一天进来吃午饭，然后就再也没有离开过（至于他们在这里呆了多少天，他们意见不一）。他们看到一些奇怪的、阴暗的人进进出出，包括一些穿着斗篷来掩盖他们的特征。这些门似乎对那些人有用。他们建议和酒吧老板普罗帕哈谈谈，他似乎总是在努力回忆着什么。",

They were sent to the Dran & Courtier to reserve a room for their master, and though they keep trying to leave, the outside door doesn't open for them. Bored, they have begun to make notes of everything around them. They have noticed that the mice appear very intelligent, ably eluding the inn's resident cat, {@creature Onyx|OoW}. The dark cat can be seen roaming the area periodically, and keeps an eye on a mouse hole near the fireplace. Luna and Thalen would make excellent wizard hirelings for the franchise if the characters were inclined to train them.": "离门最近的桌子上的三个人包括露娜和塔伦（CG女性和男性人类{@creature Commoner||commoners}），他们是一个名叫泰德的流浪巫师的青少年仆人。他们被派到德兰与库尔蒂尔为他们的主人保留一个房间，虽然他们一直想离开，但外面的门却不为他们打开。无聊之余，他们开始对周围的一切进行记录。他们注意到，这些老鼠似乎非常聪明，能够躲避旅馆里的住客猫，（1%）。可以看到这只黑猫定期在这一带游荡，并一直注意着壁炉附近的一个老鼠洞。如果角色们愿意训练他们的话，卢娜和塔伦会成为优秀的巫师雇佣者。",

	"Chance (N half-elf {@creature spy}) is a Waterdavian diplomat who has been trapped here for days. Chance has no particular use for gender, preferring to be known simply by their nickname. Chance has seen some strange people come and go, including one in cowled robes who seemed to be a mass of eyes and mouths. There was also a goblin who walked around as if he owned the place.

You hear the thumping noise again, coming from the cabinets underneath the preparation table.": "改造后的厨房的架子上摆放着适合巫婆巢穴的各种材料，包括蝙蝠翅膀、干蜥蜴和太多的人形头骨。一个垃圾桶矗立在一个角落里，旁边有一个铁制的小箱子。在厨房的准备工作台上，摆放着一把长得惊人的屠刀，周围是被切断的手指。其他同样有问题的肉类被安排在附近。炉子上的一个锅有可能会沸腾，锅盖在摇晃。你又听到了砰砰的声音，来自准备台下面的柜子。",
	"The stove has no discernible fuel source or way to turn off its heat. If the lid comes off or is removed, an explosion of tentacles and scalding water fills the kitchen. Each character in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 ({@dice 2d8}) bludgeoning damage and 5 ({@dice 1d10}) fire damage. The trap acts on initiative count 10, repeating this effect each turn until a character uses an action to replace the lid. Even with the lid on, the pot boils over again in {@dice 1d4} rounds unless disabled, as noted above.": "炉子没有明显的燃料来源，也没有办法关闭其热量。如果炉子的盖子脱落或被移开，厨房里就会出现触手和滚烫的水的爆炸。该区域内的每个角色都必须在DC14的灵巧救赎中成功，否则就会受到9({@dice 2d8}的重击伤害和5({@dice 1d10}的火焰伤害。陷阱在主动权计数10时起作用，每回合重复这个效果，直到有角色使用行动来更换盖子。即使盖上盖子，锅子也会在{@dice 1d4}个回合内再次沸腾，除非如上所述，被禁用。",

Locked inside is a {@creature flumph} named Phfffffffft. If freed, Phfffffffft shares how it sensed the aberrant horrors in this pocket dimension and came to help, but was captured. It heard the name \"Splugoth\" used by some of the creatures passing through the horrid inn. Phfffffffft also recalls someone discussing a terrifying guardian that protects \"the dimensional caverns.\" The flumph can accompany the characters back to the default Test Market if they wish, helping them as best it can in future encounters (and probably dying horribly).": "柜子是锁着的，需要用盗贼的工具成功地进行DC14灵巧检查来撬开，或者成功地进行DC14力量（{@skill Athletics}）检查来撬开。被锁在里面的是一个名为Phfffffft的{@creature flumph}。如果被释放，Phfffffft会分享它是如何感觉到这个袖珍空间中的异常恐怖，并前来帮忙，但却被抓走了。它听到了一些经过这个恐怖客栈的生物所使用的名字 \"Splugoth\"。芙芙还记得有人讨论过一个可怕的守护者，它保护着 \"维度洞窟\"。如果他们愿意的话，弗鲁姆夫可以陪同人物回到默认的测试市场，在未来的遭遇中尽可能地帮助他们（可能会死得很惨）。",

Chance heard the goblins talking about a ritual with someone named Splugoth in charge.": "如果chuuls被打败，钱斯被救活，间谍可以分享他们被地精伏击并被扔到楼上被chuuls吃掉的消息。钱斯听到地精们在谈论一个仪式，有一个叫Splugoth的人在负责。",

	"Each creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 ({@dice 2d6}) radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.": "每个生物都必须进行DC13宪法救赎，救赎失败会受到7({@dice 2d6})的辐射伤害，救赎成功则受到一半的伤害。",
	"The ritual targets a random character who is below their hit point maximum. That character regains {@dice 2d4} hit points.": "仪式的目标是一个随机的、低于其最大命中率的角色。该角色会重新获得{@dice 2d4}的命中率。",
	"If a Far Realm friend appears in the next round, roll twice to have two appear.": "如果在下一轮出现一个远界朋友，掷两次就会有两个出现。",
	"If the battle goes poorly for the characters, they can end it at any point by... well, dying. Alternatively, they can retreat and allow Faerûn to be taken over by Far Realm horrors, with either event leaving the fate of the world—and more important, the franchise's future—to be determined by you.": "如果战斗进行得不顺利，他们可以在任何时候通过......嗯，死亡来结束战斗。或者，他们可以撤退，让Faerûn被远古世界的恐怖所占领，无论哪种情况，世界的命运--更重要的是，这个系列的未来由你决定。",
	"With the present threat of the Six and the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} ended, the characters attain 7th level! Or maybe they're dead! When the fate of the world hangs in the balance, there's always a chance that the heroes will be defeated. In which case, congratulations! You get to start a new campaign—perhaps one in which another Acquisitions Incorporated franchise plays a part in undoing all the mistakes made by those losers from the last franchise.": "随着目前六人帮的威胁和{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}的结束，人物达到了第七级! 也可能他们已经死了! 当世界的命运悬而未决时，英雄们总是有机会被打败的。在这种情况下，恭喜你! 你可以开始一个新的战役--也许是一个由另一个收购公司（Acquisition Incorporated）的特许经营权发挥作用的战役，以挽回上一个特许经营权中那些失败者所犯的所有错误。",
	"If the characters were victorious, you can all celebrate a job well done! When the ritual ends, any remaining goblins surrender and beg for mercy (and jobs). Where the rift once opened, a temporary portal now leads back to the Dran & Courtier, which has returned to normal. The freed (and real) Propha Dran thanks the characters for saving the establishment and promises that they will always drink for free while in Red Larch. The members of the \"C\" Team are likewise indebted to the characters, promising them \"just heaps of money\" at some time in the future.": "如果角色们取得了胜利，你们就可以庆祝工作完成得很好! 仪式结束后，任何剩余的地精都会投降并乞求怜悯（和工作）。裂缝曾经打开的地方，现在有一个临时的入口通向德兰与库尔蒂尔，它已经恢复了正常。被释放的（也是真正的）普罗帕德兰感谢这些人物拯救了这个机构，并承诺他们在红落叶山时将永远免费喝酒。C \"小组的成员也同样对这些人物心存感激，并承诺在未来的某个时候给他们 \"一大笔钱\"。",
	"In keeping with their promise to Lottie, the characters are obliged to break the orrery up again and scatter its components far and wide. But hey, sometimes adventurers are forgetful. In the end, Omin Dran might have to announce that Head Office is taking charge of the orrery's final fate—though the franchise might certainly be entitled to keep a favorite timepiece. (Or two. Really, who can keep track of these things?) And wherever its pieces end up, the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} still has a will of its own, and might spawn additional adventures in the future.": "为了遵守对洛蒂的承诺，这些人物不得不再次将这个饰品拆开，并将其部件散落到很远的地方。但是，嘿，有时冒险家是健忘的。最后，奥明-德兰可能不得不宣布，总部将负责手镯的最终命运--尽管特许经营权可能当然有权保留一个最喜欢的计时器。(或两个。真的，谁能记住这些东西呢？)而且无论它的碎片最后在哪里，{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}仍然有自己的意志，并可能在未来产生更多的冒险。",
	"At an appropriate time, Omin Dran summons the characters to Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office in Waterdeep for a special dinner to thank them for a job well done. The cost of admission is even reduced for the characters and their guests! Whatever reward you think is appropriate can be bestowed upon the characters—including magic or contracts that provide convenient hooks for upcoming adventures.": "在适当的时候，奥明-德兰会召集这些角色到位于沃特德普的收购公司总部参加特别晚宴，以感谢他们所做的出色工作。角色和他们的客人的入场费甚至可以减免! 任何你认为合适的奖励都可以授予角色--包括为即将到来的冒险提供便利的魔法或契约。",
	"Even though \"The Orrery of the Wanderer\" is at an end, the characters should run downtime activities, both as a celebration of their victory (or to lessen the sting of a partial defeat) and to set the course for the campaign to come. The characters might enjoy changing cosmetic elements of their franchise headquarters to reflect their recent victories, spread their reputation as heroes, cement recent alliances, wrap up open plot hooks, or deal with debts or obligations incurred while saving the world.": "尽管 \"漫游者之家 \"已经结束了，但人物应该进行停工活动，这既是对胜利的庆祝（或减轻部分失败的刺痛），也是为接下来的活动设定方向。角色可能会喜欢改变他们的特许经营总部的外观元素，以反映他们最近的胜利，传播他们作为英雄的声誉，巩固最近的联盟，结束开放的情节钩子，或处理在拯救世界时产生的债务或义务。",
	"The characters' heroics might have changed the dynamic between Acquisitions Incorporated and Dran Enterprises, for good or ill. Likewise, a failed ritual deals the Six a severe setback, though Jeff Magic (Splugoth's lich boss) is still out there somewhere. But whether the Six seek immediate revenge or decide to bide their time, things don't stay quiet for long for an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. New rivals, new allies, and new opportunities are sure to make their presence known.": "这些人物的英雄事迹可能已经改变了收购公司和德兰企业之间的动态，无论好坏。同样，一个失败的仪式使六人组受到了严重的挫折，尽管杰夫-魔法（Splugoth的巫师老板）仍在某处。但无论六人组是立即复仇还是决定等待时机，对于收购公司的特许经营权来说，事情都不会平静太久。新的对手、新的盟友和新的机会肯定会让他们的存在变得更有意义。",
	"So what's next? Only you and the players know for sure. You can extend this campaign by allowing the characters to resolve plot hooks left open from previous episodes, or you can build on this adventure with new hooks like the following:": "那么下一步是什么？只有你和玩家才知道。你可以通过让角色解决之前剧情中留下的情节钩子来扩展这个活动，或者你可以在这个冒险的基础上增加新的钩子，比如下面这些。",
	"If the characters were successful in giving relationship advice to Raah the ancient deep crow, it might ask for (or, you know, demand) their assistance to locate and assess potential mates, involving combat or matchmaking as you determine.": "如果角色们成功地给古老的深海乌鸦Raah提供了关系建议，它可能会要求（或者，你知道，要求）他们协助寻找和评估潜在的伴侣，涉及战斗或相亲，由你决定。",

	"Lottie the lich calls in her favor of not killing the party to hire the characters as troubleshooters.

Sure, she's evil. But is she really \"evil\"? It's a fine line.": "巫师洛蒂以不杀生为由，要求雇佣这些人物作为麻烦解决者。她可能需要有人帮助她解决在她庞大的商业运作中遇到的困难，或者照顾那些试图挤进格雷派克赌场贸易的对手们。当然，她是邪恶的。但她真的 \"邪恶 \"吗？这是条细线。",
	"When the characters left the bodies of the dwarf wedding party at the end of {@adventure episode 5|OoW|5}, the dwarves immediately understood that they'd been possessed. Through divination magic or incriminating evidence accidentally left in the caravan on the way out of Horn Enclave, Clans Thunderwind and Dhargun know that the characters were the ones responsible. Clan Dhargun might want to hire the characters as operatives for their business operations or engage in commercial agreements with the franchise on the basis of the characters' extraordinarily clever ruse. Clan Thunderwind might want them all dead.": "当人物在{@adventure episode 5|OoW|5}的结尾离开矮人婚礼队伍的尸体时，矮人立即明白他们被附身了。通过占卜魔法或在离开霍恩飞地时不小心留在商队中的罪证，雷风部族和达贡部族知道这些角色就是负责任的人。达贡氏族可能想雇用这些人物作为他们商业运作的操作人员，或者在这些人物异常聪明的诡计的基础上与特许权签订商业协议。雷风部族可能希望他们都死掉。",
	"If the characters didn't defeat him, evil archmage-for-hire Hoobur Gran'Shoop is still out there somewhere. The crazed gnome might be spoiling for revenge. Or he might have forgotten all about the characters, only to accidentally cross their paths again on completely unrelated business. Seriously, he's a little out of it.": "如果人物没有打败他，邪恶的大法师胡伯-格兰肖普仍然在某个地方。这个疯狂的侏儒可能正在为复仇而发愁。或者他可能已经忘记了所有的角色，只是在完全不相关的事情上意外地再次与他们相遇。说真的，他有点不在状态。",
	"As word of their triumph over the Six spreads, characters returning to Waterdeep for business will be sought out by Otis Adalgrim, who wants them to meet the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr. The characters could be asked to join the Gray Hands, and might have an opportunity to work with Force Grey—an elite group of specialist adventurers drawn from the Gray Hands.": "随着他们战胜六人帮的消息传开，回到水底世界做生意的人物会被奥蒂斯-阿达尔格林找出来，他想让他们去见黑杖，金刚萨法尔。这些角色可能会被要求加入灰手党，并可能有机会与灰手党中的精英专业冒险者小组合作。",

	"Whatever direction you and the players decide to take your Acquisitions Incorporated campaign in, keep one eye on the balance sheet, the other eye on the competition—and have fun.": "无论你和球员们决定将你的收购公司活动引向哪个方向，都要关注资产负债表，另一只眼睛盯着竞争，并从中获得乐趣。",
	"Feather is lying low after a failed assassination attempt in the South Ward the previous night (see the \"{@area Life in Waterdeep|00b|x}\" sidebar earlier in this episode), and pretends to be Jolly's assistant.

(A hint of the killings is noted in the \"{@area Life in Waterdeep|00b|x}\" sidebar earlier in this episode.) Any feet placed on the altar teleport to this room. By placing clues on the feet that lead to the murderer, you can create a side trek mystery for the characters. You can also have two more feet suddenly appear in midair near the ceiling, then drop into the room as the adventurers fight.": "沃特德普的一个杀人犯一直在杀人，拿走他们的脚，然后把他们放在隐藏在城市里的一个祭坛上，作为对那啥啥的祭品。(在本集前面的\"{@area Life in Waterdeep|00b|x} \"侧边栏中提到了这些杀人事件的提示）。任何放在祭坛上的脚都会传送到这个房间。通过在脚上放置指向凶手的线索，你可以为人物创造一个侧面的跋涉之谜。你也可以让另外两只脚突然出现在天花板附近的半空中，然后在冒险家们战斗时落入房间。",
	"{@i Congratulations on the determination that got you this far in search of the {@item wheel of stars|AI}! And sorry that your reward has been denied you.
