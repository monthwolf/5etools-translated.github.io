	"The characters are drafted by the Flaming Fist, the army of mercenaries tasked with protecting Baldur's Gate. Without Grand Duke {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} to lead them, the Flaming Fist mercenaries are little more than glorified thugs. The characters' orders are to help maintain peace by rooting out and destroying followers of Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul—evil gods collectively known as the Dead Three. These vile priests, assassins, and necromancers are murdering city folk at random, and the Flaming Fist is too distracted and disorganized to hunt them down and find their lair. In the course of their investigation, the characters learn that the Dead Three cultists are secretly being financed by Thalamra Vanthampur, one of three remaining dukes who preside over the government of Baldur's Gate, using money stolen from the hoard of Tiamat, the evil queen of dragons imprisoned in the Nine Hells.": "这些人物是由火焰之拳征召的，这是一支负责保护博德之门的雇佣军。没有大公{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}的领导，火焰之拳的雇佣兵们不过是些光荣的打手。他们的任务是帮助维持和平，铲除并摧毁贝恩、巴哈和米尔库尔的追随者--这些邪恶的神灵统称为 \"死亡三人组\"。这些卑鄙的牧师、刺客和死灵法师正在随意谋杀城市居民，而火焰之拳分心且无组织，无法追捕他们并找到他们的巢穴。在调查过程中，角色们了解到，死灵三教派是由主持博德之门政府的三位剩余公爵之一的塔拉姆拉-范坦普尔秘密资助的，资金来自于被囚禁在九层地狱的邪恶龙后提亚马特的仓库。",
	"To keep Baldur's Gate from falling into Zariel's clutches, the characters must take the shield far away from the city. Reya Mantlemorn, a young knight from Elturel, suspects that the Vanthampurs are sheltering {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} at their estate and offers aid. Characters who storm Duke Vanthampur's villa find Thavius hidden in the dungeon below it. Thavius is helping Thalamra Vanthampur use the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA} to bring about the fall of Baldur's Gate, in much the same fashion he used the Companion (see \"{@area The Companion|007|x}\") to doom Elturel. If the characters slay Thavius, his soul travels to the Nine Hells and re-forms as an amnizu devil on Avernus (see \"\"{@area Poor Devil: Thavius Kreeg|2b8|x}\").": "为了不让博德之门落入扎里尔的魔掌，人物必须把盾牌带到远离城市的地方。来自Elturel的年轻骑士Reya Mantlemorn怀疑Vanthampur公爵在他们的庄园里避难{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}，并提供了援助。冲进范坦普尔公爵别墅的人物发现塔维乌斯藏在别墅下面的地牢里。Thavius正在帮助Thalamra Vanthampur使用{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}来实现Baldur's Gate的衰落，这与他使用同伴（见\"{@area The Companion|007|x}\"）来毁灭Elturel的方式很相似。如果人物杀死了塔维乌斯，他的灵魂就会前往九层地狱，并在阿弗纳斯重新形成一个无主的魔鬼（见\"\"{@area Poor Devil: Thavius Kreeg|2b8|x}\"）。",
	"In the course of dealing with {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} and the Vanthampur family, characters are likely to acquire the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA} as well as an {@item infernal puzzle box|BGDIA} that they can't open. They might also liberate a spy imprisoned in Duke Vanthampur's dungeon who works for {@creature Sylvira Savikas|BGDIA}, a tiefling expert on the Nine Hells. Determined to thwart devil worshipers in positions of power throughout the Western Heartlands, Sylvira operates out of the library of Candlekeep and has spent years monitoring devil activity in Baldur's Gate, Elturel, and the surrounding region. Her spies are after the puzzle box, which is believed to contain a copy of the fiendish contract Thavius signed to seal Elturel's doom.": "在与{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}和Vanthampur家族打交道的过程中，人物有可能获得{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}以及一个他们无法打开的{@item infernal puzzle box|BGDIA}。他们还可能解放一个被囚禁在Vanthampur公爵地牢里的间谍，他为{@creature Sylvira Savikas|BGDIA}工作，一个研究九层地狱的铁皮人专家。西尔维拉决心挫败在整个西部心脏地带身居要职的魔鬼崇拜者，她在烛光之城的图书馆工作，并花了数年时间监视恶魔在博德之门、埃尔图勒以及周边地区的活动。她的间谍们正在寻找谜盒，据说里面有一份塔维斯签署的封印艾尔图勒厄运的恶魔契约的副本。",
	"{@adventure Chapter 2|BGDIA|2} opens with the characters' arrival in Elturel, which is anchored by enormous chains and trapped under the baleful light of the Companion. If the characters do nothing, the city will be pulled down into the River Styx and bound to the Nine Hells forever. {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} tries her best to serve as the party's guide in Avernus, but the hollyphant's memories are fragmented. It becomes clear, however, that {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} has a personal connection to Zariel, dating back to the archdevil's former angelic existence.": "{@adventure Chapter 2|BGDIA|2}以人物到达Elturel开始，Elturel被巨大的锁链固定住，并被困在同伴的邪恶之光下。如果人物什么都不做，这座城市就会被拉到冥河里，永远被束缚在九幽地狱里。{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}尽力充当党在阿弗纳斯的向导，但冬青象的记忆已经支离破碎。然而，很明显，（2%）与扎里尔有个人联系，可以追溯到大恶魔以前的天使存在。",
	"After scouring Elturel for survivors and clashing with the denizens of Avernus, the characters encounter the valiant {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}, who has been placed in the most unusual situation of defending a city he has long opposed. The beleaguered Ravengard urges the characters to do whatever they can to free Elturel and return what's left of it to Faerûn. To do so, they must scour Avernus for the means to destroy the Companion or break the enormous chains that shackle that city, as described in {@adventure chapter 3|BGDIA|3}.": "在搜寻Elturel的幸存者并与Avernus的居民发生冲突后，人物遇到了英勇的{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}，他被置于最不寻常的境地，保卫他长期反对的城市。陷入困境的拉文加德敦促角色们尽一切可能解放艾尔图勒，并将它剩下的东西归还给法鲁恩。要做到这一点，他们必须在Avernus寻找摧毁同伴或打破束缚该城市的巨大枷锁的方法，如{@adventure chapter 3|BGDIA|3}中所述。",
	"Avernus has long been a battlefield in the never-ending Blood War. Apart from clashing demons and devils, petty warlords scour the Avernian wastelands in search of treasure, salvage, and fuel for their infernal war machines. Characters who forge an alliance with one warlord risk alienating the others. By acquiring an infernal war machine, characters can travel quickly across Avernus—a domain rife with tortured souls, warmongers, and devils eager to tempt would-be heroes into soul-corrupting deals.": "长期以来，Avernus一直是永无止境的血战中的战场。除了恶魔和魔鬼的冲突之外，小军阀们还在阿维尼亚的荒原上寻找宝藏、残余物和他们的地狱战争机器的燃料。与一个军阀结盟的角色有可能疏远其他军阀。通过获得一台地狱战争机器，角色可以快速穿越阿弗纳斯--一个充斥着受折磨的灵魂、战争贩子和渴望诱惑未来的英雄进行灵魂腐蚀交易的恶魔的领域。",
	"The more time she spends with the characters, the more {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} begins to remember long-lost memories of the {@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}, an angelic weapon with the power to destroy the Companion. After Zariel's fall from grace, the sword was hidden in a stronghold called the Bleeding Citadel—a celestial sanctuary trapped in Avernus. The quest for the sword forms the crux of {@adventure chapter 4|BGDIA|7}, leading to the revelation that Zariel can be redeemed.": "她与这些人物相处的时间越长，{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}就越是开始回忆起久违的记忆，{@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}是一把具有摧毁同伴力量的天使武器。在扎里尔堕落之后，这把剑被藏在一个叫做 \"流血堡垒 \"的据点里--一个被困在阿弗纳斯的天体圣地。对这把剑的探索构成了{@adventure chapter 4|BGDIA|7}的关键，导致了扎里尔可以被救赎的启示。",
	"As tempting as such pursuits can be, the characters must be careful, for devil deals, demon lords, and Tiamat's rage number among the multiverse's greatest threats. Also, Zariel herself might become cross with the characters for daring to meddle in her diabolical affairs. How the adventure concludes depends on the choices the characters make, the chaos they foment, and the deals they forge, as discussed in {@adventure chapter 5|BGDIA|8}.": "尽管这种追求很诱人，但人物必须小心，因为魔鬼交易、恶魔领主和提亚马特的愤怒都是多元宇宙的最大威胁。另外，扎里尔本人也可能因为敢于插手她的邪恶事务而与角色发生冲突。冒险如何结束取决于人物的选择、他们煽动的混乱和他们达成的交易，如{@adventure chapter 5|BGDIA|8}所述。",
	"On the plane of Mount Celestia, the angel Zariel chastised her peers for not getting involved in the Blood War. She felt that it was the responsibility of the angelic host to destroy evil in the multiverse, rather than stand back and watch demons and devils annihilate one another, destroying vast swaths of the multiverse in the process. In defiance of her superiors, Zariel left Mount Celestia and went to Elturel, where she rallied an army of warriors and trained them to fight in the Blood War. She promised them that when they were ready, she would lead them into battle on Avernus.": "在天龙山上，天使扎丽尔责备她的同龄人没有参与到血战中。她觉得天使的责任是在多元宇宙中消灭邪恶，而不是站在后面看着恶魔和魔鬼互相消灭，在这个过程中摧毁大片的多元宇宙。为了反抗她的上级，扎丽尔离开了天龙山，去了Elturel，在那里她召集了一支战士的军队，训练他们参加血战。她向他们承诺，当他们准备好时，她将带领他们在阿弗纳斯作战。",
	"Zariel never forgot her betrayers—those who ran from the battlefield. She kept a close eye on Elturel, waiting for the day when she could enact her revenge. That day came in 1444 DR, when Elturel was conquered by a vampire lord. A priest of Torm named {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} appealed to any power to help him save his holy city. In that instant, Zariel emerged from a pillar of fire and offered him a deal, which Thavius readily accepted.": "扎里尔从未忘记她的背叛者--那些从战场上逃跑的人。她一直密切关注着Elturel，等待着有一天她可以实施她的复仇。这一天在公元1444年到来，Elturel被一个吸血鬼领主征服了。一位名叫{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}的托尔姆的牧师呼吁任何力量帮助他拯救他的圣城。在那一瞬间，扎里尔从火柱中出现，向他提出了一个交易，塔维乌斯欣然接受。",
	"In the sky over Elturel, a radiant sphere called the Companion appeared, blazing like a second sun. Powered by a planetar imprisoned within it, the Companion bathed Elturel and the surrounding countryside in holy light which sent the vampire lord scrambling for the shadows and laid waste to his undead army. {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}, who took credit for summoning the Companion, was hailed as the savior of the city and rose to become its high overseer. Under Kreeg's decades-long rule, Elturel embarked on a path to becoming not just a holy city but the holy nation of Elturgard.": "在Elturel的上空，出现了一个被称为 \"同伴 \"的光芒四射的球体，像第二个太阳一样炽热。在一个被囚禁在其中的行星体的驱动下，同伴使艾尔图勒和周围的乡村沐浴在圣光之中，这让吸血鬼领主慌忙躲进阴影中，并浪费了他的亡灵军队。{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}将召唤同伴的功劳归功于他，他被誉为城市的救世主，并升为城市的最高监督者。在克雷格数十年的统治下，埃尔图勒走上了一条道路，不仅成为了圣城，而且成为了埃尔图加德的圣国。",
	"Disguised as a refugee, {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} was one of the first of his people to arrive at Baldur's Gate with news of Elturel's \"destruction.\" He slipped through the city's gates with the help of his influential friend, Duke Vanthampur, and took refuge in her home.": "伪装成一个难民，{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}是他的族人中最早到达Baldur's Gate的Elturel \"毁灭 \"的消息之一。他在他有影响力的朋友Vanthampur公爵的帮助下溜进了城门，并在她家避难。",
	"As the DM, you can play devils as humorous, aloof, bombastic, conniving, or scatterbrained, but a general rule to follow is this: devils have no desire to do good. When dealing with mortals, devils are constantly figuring out how to exploit and corrupt them, often behind thin smiles of feigned concern and false charm.": "作为管理者，你可以把魔鬼扮演成幽默的、冷漠的、狂轰滥炸的、纵容的、或散漫的，但要遵循的一般规则是：魔鬼没有做好事的欲望。在与凡人打交道时，魔鬼不断地想出如何利用和腐蚀他们，往往是在假装关心和虚假魅力的薄薄的笑容背后。",
	"But devils do more than corrupt. They also fight in the Blood War. Asmodeus attests that serving in his infernal legion is a holy honor, for in so doing a devil helps protect the multiverse from demonic destruction. While that sounds impressive, most devils partake in the Blood War only to distinguish themselves among their peers and move up the chain of command. Endlessly fighting demons isn't what most devils signed up for.": "但魔鬼不仅仅是贪污。他们也在血战中战斗。阿斯莫德（Asmodeus）证明，在他的地狱军团中服役是一种神圣的荣誉，因为这样做的话，魔鬼可以帮助保护多元宇宙免受恶魔的破坏。虽然这听起来令人印象深刻，但大多数魔鬼参加血战只是为了在他们的同龄人中脱颖而出，并在指挥系统中获得晋升。无休止地与恶魔战斗并不是大多数魔鬼的目的。",
	"If a devil dies somewhere other than the Nine Hells, it re-forms in the Nine Hells and is therefore not truly killed. However, a devil that is killed in the Nine Hells is dead forever; not surprisingly, that's why devils tend to be more cautious in their dealings at home than abroad.": "如果一个魔鬼在九层地狱以外的地方死亡，它会在九层地狱重新形成，因此并没有真正被杀死。然而，在九层地狱被杀的魔鬼就会永远死去；这并不奇怪，这就是为什么魔鬼在国内的交易往往比国外更加谨慎。",
	"This adventure features the Nine Hells, which is described in {@book chapter 2|DMG|2|The Nine Hells} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. Devils, being the primary inhabitants of the Nine Hells, play prominent roles in this story. Before running the adventure, it's worth taking the time to familiarize yourself with the \"Devils\" entry in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, which not only describes the most common types of devils but also explains their hierarchy, how they behave in accordance with their lawful evil alignment, what pleases and enrages them, and why they're scared of dying on their home plane.": "这个冒险故事的特点是九层地狱，这在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}的{@book chapter 2|DMG|2|The Nine Hells}中有所描述。魔鬼是九层地狱的主要居民，在这个故事中扮演着重要角色。在进行冒险之前，值得花时间熟悉一下{@book Monster Manual|MM}中的 \"魔鬼 \"条目，它不仅描述了最常见的魔鬼类型，还解释了它们的等级制度，它们如何按照合法的邪恶路线行事，什么会让它们高兴和愤怒，以及它们为什么害怕在自己的母体上死亡。",
	"Common traits among devils include the following:": "魔鬼的共同特征包括以下几点。",
	"{@b Charm}. Devils are consummate charmers. Like humans, some are better at it than others. The good ones savor the exchange of pleasantries, speaking in measured sentences or noticing pleasant details about the environment or a character's clothing.": "{@b Charm}. 魔鬼是完美的魅惑者。像人类一样，有些人比其他人更善于此道。优秀的人喜欢寒暄，用有分寸的句子说话，或注意到环境或人物服装的愉快细节。",
	"{@b Patience}. Devils are rarely in a rush to make a deal or sign a contract. As masters of the long con, devils make genuinely good deals with mortals to buy appreciation and trust that can be leveraged during more consequential dealings later on.": "{@b Patience}. 魔鬼们很少急于做交易或签合同。作为长期骗局的大师，魔鬼与凡人做真正的好交易，以购买赞赏和信任，这可以在以后更重要的交易中得到利用。",
	"{@b Civility}. Devils like to pretend that they run by the same rules and obey the same social conventions as mortals. Devils have no problem appearing and acting in whatever manner they need to achieve their end goal—usually a contract for services or a soul. They've learned that more can be gained from behaving in a civilized manner than reacting angrily or violently.": "{@b Civility}. 魔鬼喜欢假装他们和凡人一样遵循同样的规则，遵守同样的社会习俗。魔鬼以任何方式出现和行动都没有问题，他们需要实现他们的最终目标--通常是服务合同或灵魂。他们已经知道，与愤怒或暴力反应相比，以文明的方式行事可以获得更多好处。",
	"{@b Deviousness}. Devils don't age, so there's rarely a sense of urgency with a devil as it plots its conquest or corruption of a soul. This allows for winding schemes that are rarely what they seem on the surface. For minor devils, a simple acceptance of an evil gift is enough, while greater devils enjoy tangling up characters in choices that compromise their values.": "{@b Deviousness}. 魔鬼不会变老，所以当它策划征服或腐蚀一个灵魂时，很少有紧迫感。这就使得曲折的计划很少是表面上看起来的那样。对于小恶魔来说，简单地接受一个邪恶的礼物就足够了，而大恶魔则喜欢在损害其价值观的选择中纠缠角色。",
	"{@b Unscrupulousness}. Being evil and soulless, a devil cannot be embarrassed or shamed, doesn't feel guilt or remorse, and is prepared to do the most heinous acts to get what it wants.": "{@b Unscrupulousness}. 由于邪恶和没有灵魂，魔鬼不会感到尴尬或羞耻，不会感到内疚或悔恨，并准备做最令人发指的行为来获得它想要的东西。",
	"{@b Fear of Demotion}. A devil that disappoints a superior can be demoted, whereupon it's instantly transformed into a lesser form of devil. The greater the devil, the more it fears demotion and the loss of its power. Thus, a devil takes great pains to hide its failures or pin them on someone else.": "{@b Fear of Demotion}. 一个让上司失望的魔鬼可以被降级，这时它就会立刻变成一个较低级的魔鬼。越是伟大的魔鬼，越是害怕降级和失去权力。因此，魔鬼会不遗余力地隐藏自己的失败，或将其归咎于别人。",
	"Much of the adventure takes place on the first layer of the Nine Hells. This is not, to put it mildly, your run-of-the-mill D&D setting. The following tips and tricks can help you make the characters' stay in Avernus a remarkable one.": "冒险的大部分内容发生在九层地狱的第一层。可以说，这不是你的普通的D&D环境。下面的提示和技巧可以帮助你使人物在阿弗纳斯的逗留变得与众不同。",
	"The Nine Hells is a place of abject misery where no one is happy. Weaker devils are exploited and tormented by their superiors. Stronger devils live in constant fear of being passed over for promotion or demoted. Even when something seems to go right, joy is fleeting and only fuels suspicion that things are about to get much worse. Such inescapable pessimism leads many creatures to become apathetic and spiteful. They take perverse delight in spreading their unhappiness like a contagion.": "九层地狱是一个赤裸裸的苦难之地，没有人是幸福的。弱小的魔鬼被他们的上级剥削和折磨。强壮的魔鬼生活在不断的恐惧中，害怕被提拔或降级。即使有什么事情似乎是正确的，快乐也是转瞬即逝的，而且只会助长对事情即将变得更加糟糕的怀疑。这种不可避免的悲观主义导致许多生物变得冷漠和充满怨恨。他们反常地喜欢像传染病一样传播他们的不快乐。",
	"You can remind players that the Nine Hells is a place of misery and suffering in the following ways:": "你可以通过以下方式提醒玩家，九层地狱是一个苦难的地方。",
	"In conversations with the characters, natives of the Nine Hells like to bemoan their misfortune and blame others for their horrible lives.": "在与人物的对话中，九层地狱的当地人喜欢哀叹他们的不幸，并将他们可怕的生活归咎于他人。",
	"When a character accomplishes something, you can undercut that success in some small way. For example, the character's belt might snap, or a hellish insect might sting the character on the neck and leave a welt.": "当一个角色完成了某件事情时，你可以用一些小方法来削弱这种成功。例如，这个人物的腰带可能会断裂，或者一只地狱般的昆虫可能会刺伤这个人物的脖子并留下一道伤痕。",
	"If a character rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll made with a nonmagical weapon, you can decide that the weapon breaks.": "如果一个角色在用非魔法武器进行的攻击卷上掷出自然的1，你可以决定该武器破裂。",
	"Avernus is insidious in the way it fosters greed and makes visitors pay or barter for the things they need to survive. Most of the wildlife on Avernus is not edible to mortals, and most sources of water are poisonous or otherwise tainted. The rarity of edible food and drinkable water encourages hoarding behavior.": "Avernus的阴险之处在于它助长了贪婪，让游客为生存所需的东西付出代价或进行交易。Avernus上的大多数野生动物对凡人来说都是不可食用的，大多数水源都是有毒的或被污染的。可食用的食物和可饮用的水的稀有性鼓励了囤积行为。",
	"You can remind players about the awfulness of Avernus in the following ways:": "你可以通过以下方式提醒玩家阿弗纳斯的可怕之处。",
	"Any food or drink the characters bring with them or conjure by magic retains its nutritional value but tastes awful when eaten or imbibed on Avernus. The food tastes like ash, the water tastes like bile, and the wine tastes like spoiled milk.": "角色们带来的或用魔法变出的任何食物或饮料都保留了其营养价值，但在Avernus上吃或喝的时候味道很糟糕。食物的味道像灰，水的味道像胆汁，酒的味道像变质的牛奶。",
	"If the characters want something that tastes good, they must buy it from licensed sellers such as {@creature Mahadi the rakshasa|BGDIA}, who runs a restaurant called Infernal Rapture (see \"{@area Infernal Rapture|2a1|x}\"). The price of a good-tasting meal is always a bit too high.": "如果人物想吃好吃的东西，他们必须从有执照的卖家那里买，比如{@creature Mahadi the rakshasa|BGDIA}，他经营着一家叫 \"无间狂欢 \"的餐厅（见\"{@area Infernal Rapture|2a1|x}\"）。味道好的饭菜的价格总是有点太高。",
	"If a character commits a selfish act, you can reward that selfishness by granting that character inspiration (as described in {@book chapter 4|PHB|4|Inspiration} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}). Unlike regular inspiration, the benefit can't be transferred to another creature.": "如果一个角色做出了自私的行为，你可以通过授予该角色灵感来奖励这种自私的行为（如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}的{@book chapter 4|PHB|4|Inspiration}所述）。与普通的灵感不同，这种好处不能转移给另一个生物。",
	"Before the Blood War reduced it to a blasted wasteland, Avernus was a honey trap created by Asmodeus, a paradise of infinite delights designed to lure and enrapture mortals. Fragments of this lost paradise still plunge from Avernus's sky as burning meteors, and the land is dotted with the ruins of palaces and idyllic gardens that were obscenely beautiful in eons past.": "在血战将其变成一片废墟之前，阿弗纳斯是阿斯莫德创造的一个蜂蜜陷阱，一个充满无限乐趣的天堂，旨在引诱和迷惑凡人。这个失落的天堂的碎片仍然像燃烧的流星一样从阿弗纳斯的天空坠落，这片土地上遍布着宫殿和田园的废墟，在过去的岁月里，这些宫殿和田园是非常美丽的。",
	"Fleeting reminders of this ancient paradise can come to the characters in the following ways:": "对这个古老的天堂的短暂提醒可以通过以下方式出现在人物身上。",
	"While traveling across Avernus, the characters glimpse a fantastic mirage: a grand palace or garden oasis that vanishes when they get within 100 feet of it.": "在穿越Avernus时，人物瞥见了一个奇妙的海市蜃楼：一个宏伟的宫殿或花园绿洲，当他们进入100英尺范围内就会消失。",
	"A random character hears beautiful music or laughter, catches the scent of flowers or perfume, or experiences a gentle caress. The sensation has no discernible source and fades after a few moments.": "一个随机的角色听到了美妙的音乐或笑声，闻到了花香或香水的味道，或者经历了温柔的爱抚。这种感觉没有明显的来源，片刻之后就会消失。",
	"The characters find a relic that survived the fall of paradise, such as a beautiful vase or toppled statue. The first character to touch the relic experiences a fleeting moment of pure joy.": "角色们找到了在天堂沦陷中幸存下来的遗物，比如一个美丽的花瓶或被推翻的雕像。第一个触摸到遗迹的人物会体验到短暂的纯粹的快乐。",
	"Geography warps at the whims of the Nine Hells. One of the liberating aspects of this planar feature is that you don't need to be fastidious about keeping track of where locations are in relation to one another.": "地理环境随九层地狱的变化而变化。这种平面特征的一个自由方面是，你不需要快速跟踪地点之间的关系。",
	"While the spatial distortion can be unsettling to visitors, it affords you the following benefits as a DM:": "虽然空间上的扭曲会让游客感到不安，但作为DM，它为你带来了以下好处。",
	"You can decide how long it takes for characters to get from one place to the next. For example, the characters might need to travel 6 miles to get from Fort Knucklebone to Haruman's Hill, and 60 miles to get from Haruman's Hill back to Fort Knucklebone.": "你可以决定人物从一个地方到下一个地方需要多长时间。例如，人物可能需要走6英里才能从克努克勒本堡到哈鲁曼山，而从哈鲁曼山回到克努克勒本堡需要60英里。",
	"If the characters are in a rush to get somewhere, an {@creature imp} could appear out of nowhere and, for the price of a {@item soul coin|BGDIA} or other valuable item, show them a shortcut that halves the distance the characters must travel to reach their destination.": "如果人物急于去某个地方，一个{@creature imp}可以突然出现，并以{@item soul coin|BGDIA}或其他有价值的物品为代价，向他们展示一条捷径，使人物到达目的地的距离减半。",
	"There are simple ways in which you can tailor the adventure to make Avernus an even more hellish place for your particular band of adventurers. Consider using the following methods to customize your party's experience:": "你可以用一些简单的方法来定制冒险，使阿弗纳斯成为你的特定冒险者队伍的一个更可怕的地方。考虑使用以下方法来定制你的队伍的经验。",
	"Learn what scares the characters. At the start of the adventure, ask each player to provide you with a note of three things their character fears. Save these until the party reaches the Nine Hells, then use them to customize the terrors that populate Avernus.": "了解人物害怕的东西。在冒险开始时，要求每个玩家向你提供他们的角色害怕的三样东西的笔记。把这些东西保存起来，直到队伍到达九层地狱，然后用它们来定制阿弗纳斯的恐怖事物。",
	"Keep a list of the flaws that the players selected when they first created their characters, so that you can remind the players of these faults when situations arise to test them. For example, a character with the Folk Hero background might have the flaw, \"I'm quick to assume that someone is trying to cheat me.\" Let the player wrestle with this flaw during negotiations with devils and other denizens of Avernus.": "把玩家在第一次创建角色时选择的缺陷列一个清单，这样，当出现考验玩家的情况时，你就可以提醒他们这些缺陷。例如，一个有民间英雄背景的角色可能有这样的缺陷：\"我很快就会认为有人想欺骗我\"。让玩家在与魔鬼和其他Avernus居民的谈判中与这个缺陷搏斗。",
	"The city of Elturel, capital of Elturgard, is located much farther inland along the River Chionthar. Whereas Baldur's Gate has a well-earned reputation for being a nest of vipers, Elturel is seen as a beacon of faith, order, and high culture. The two cities have endured a long, bitter rivalry that originated when Baldur's Gate began stealing cargo and coin from ships heading to and from Elturel, stifling that city's sea trade. Though the conflicts between Baldur's Gate and Elturel have always fallen short of open warfare, relations between the cities have been tense for a long time—too long, some would say.": "Elturgard的首府Elturel市位于Chionthar河沿岸更远的内陆地区。博德之门因其是一个毒蛇的巢穴而获得了良好的声誉，而Elturel则被视为信仰、秩序和高级文化的灯塔。这两座城市长期以来一直存在着激烈的竞争，起源于博德之门开始从往来Elturel的船上偷取货物和钱币，扼杀了该城市的海上贸易。虽然Baldur's Gate和Elturel之间的冲突一直没有公开的战争，但这两个城市之间的关系已经紧张了很久，有人会说太长了。",
	"A tenday ago, Grand Duke {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} left Baldur's Gate with a company of Flaming Fist soldiers on a diplomatic mission to Elturel, accepting a formal invitation from Elturel's High Overseer, {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}. Ravengard did not go eagerly, however. It took months of persuasion by his fellow dukes—the other three members of Baldur's Gate's ruling Council of Four—to convince him to accept Elturel's invitation and leave the city in their capable hands. {@creature Duke Thalamra Vanthampur|BGDIA} was especially convincing, having gathered petitions from the nobility as well as leaders of the common rabble.": "一天前，大公爵{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}带着一连火焰之拳的士兵离开博德之门，前往艾尔图勒执行外交任务，接受艾尔图勒的高级监督官{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}的正式邀请。然而，拉文格德并没有急着去。他的同僚公爵们--博德之门执政的四人委员会的其他三位成员花了几个月的时间来说服他接受Elturel的邀请，把城市交给他们来管理。{@creature Duke Thalamra Vanthampur|BGDIA}特别有说服力，他收集了来自贵族以及普通乌合之众领袖的请愿书。",
	"Not long after Ravengard arrived in Elturel, the city was dragged down into the Nine Hells—wiped off the map. Given the distance between the two cities, it's no surprise that the residents of Baldur's Gate didn't hear of Elturel's fate until refugees from Elturgard starting arriving in droves. Rumors concerning Elturel's disappearance spread like wildfire, stoking fears that Baldur's Gate might be next. At the same time, panic swept through the ranks of the Flaming Fist, which suddenly found itself without a strong leader.": "在Ravengard到达Elturel不久，这座城市就被拖入了九层地狱--从地图上抹去了。鉴于两座城市之间的距离，博德之门的居民没有听说Elturel的命运，直到Elturgard的难民开始成群结队地到来，这并不奇怪。有关Elturel失踪的谣言像野火一样蔓延，激起了人们对Baldur's Gate可能是下一个的恐惧。同时，恐慌席卷了火焰之拳的队伍，它突然发现自己没有一个强有力的领导者。",
	"In the grand duke's absence, the government of Baldur's Gate continues to function under the three remaining dukes—Belynne Stelmane, Dillard Portyr, and Thalamra Vanthampur. Duke Portyr has gone so far as to recall his niece, Liara Portyr, from her post as commander of the Flaming Fist at Fort Beluarian in Chult, in the hopes that she can keep the Flaming Fist in check. However, it will take time for her ship to arrive. Meanwhile, refugees from Elturgard continue to arrive with dire claims that nothing remains of Elturel except a crater in the ground.": "在大公不在的情况下，博德之门的政府继续在剩下的三位公爵--斯泰尔曼尼（Belynne Stelmane）、迪拉德-波特尔（Dillard Portyr）和塔拉姆拉-范坦普尔（Thalamra Vanthampur）的领导下运作。波蒂尔公爵甚至把他的侄女利亚拉-波蒂尔从楚尔特的贝卢安堡的火焰之拳指挥官的岗位上召回，希望她能控制住火焰之拳的发展。然而，她的船需要时间才能到达。与此同时，来自Elturgard的难民继续到来，他们可怕地声称Elturel除了地面上的一个大坑外什么都没有留下。",
	"Among those fleeing Elturgard are several Hellriders—paladins who have sworn oaths to defend Elturel. Those warriors escaped the city's fate only because they weren't in Elturel when it fell, and the Flaming Fist has taken to arresting them on sight, lest they try to stir up trouble in Baldur's Gate. The Hellriders are not going quietly, however, leading to violence and bloodshed.": "在那些逃离艾尔图加德的人中，有几个地狱骑士--那些发誓要保卫艾尔图加德的圣骑士。这些战士逃过了城市的命运，只是因为他们在艾尔图勒沦陷时不在那里，而火焰之拳已经采取了当场逮捕他们的做法，以免他们试图在博德之门挑起麻烦。然而，地狱骑士们并没有安静地离开，而是导致了暴力和流血事件。",
	"Without {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} to stay their hand, Flaming Fist captains are brutally exercising their autonomy under the veneer of maintaining order. They've closed the outer gates to keep Baldur's Gate safe from the refugee \"threat,\" effectively trapping Baldurians behind their own walls. With the Flaming Fist distracted by the refugee crisis, city folk are being hunted and murdered in the streets by cultists of the Dead Three—the evil gods Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul. Without the Flaming Fist to curtail them, these cultists have grown bold and now move freely within the city, their activities financed and supported in secret by {@creature Duke Thalamra Vanthampur|BGDIA}.": "在没有{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}留手的情况下，火焰之拳的队长们在维持秩序的外衣下残酷地行使着他们的自主权。他们关闭了外门，以保证博德门免受难民的 \"威胁\"，实际上是把博德门人困在自己的城墙后面。由于火焰之拳被难民危机分散了注意力，城市居民正在被死亡三神--邪恶的Bane、Bhaal和Myrkul的崇拜者在街上追杀。由于没有火焰之拳的遏制，这些邪教分子胆子越来越大，现在在城市里自由活动，他们的活动得到了（1%）的秘密资助和支持。",

From their high perches in the Upper City, the local nobles—known as patriars—gaze down with veiled contempt upon the common rabble in the grimy Lower City, which hugs the foggy harbor. The whole of Baldur's Gate reeks of blood, crime, and opportunity. One can easily fathom why pirates and traders are drawn to this place like flies to a carcass.": "欢迎来到博德之门，这是一个名副其实的老鼠和毒蛇的巢穴，依附在俯瞰奇安塔尔河的岩石坡上。在上城的高处，当地的贵族们被称为 \"爱国者\"，他们带着蔑视的眼光俯视着下城的普通乌合之众，下城紧挨着雾气缭绕的港口。整个博德之门充满了血腥、犯罪和机会的味道。人们很容易理解为什么海盗和商人会像苍蝇一样被吸引到这个地方。",

	"The patriars pay a mercenary army called the Flaming Fist to protect their interests in Baldur's Gate, and by extension, the city itself. The Flaming Fist has gained even more power since their charismatic leader, {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}, claimed the title of Grand Duke a few years ago. Apparently, Ravengard is missing.

	"All of this was brought to your attention shortly after you were drafted by the Flaming Fist to help defend the city. Your orders are to speak to Captain Zodge at the Basilisk Gate, which pierces the city's eastern wall and takes its name from the various statues that rest in its niches and perch atop its battlements.

	"Characters can try to interrogate Amrik for information, but he's a practiced liar who won't incriminate himself or any family member he fears, including his mother and older brother. If the characters mention Mortlock, Amrik accuses that \"scar-faced hulk\" of consorting with the lowest of the low in Baldur's Gate to bring ruin to their family. Amrik's utter disdain for his younger brother is palpable, though he won't admit to his participation in a conspiracy to assassinate Mortlock. If the characters level accusations against him, Amrik tries to shift the blame to Mortlock.

The staff of the Low Lantern do not intervene.": "阿姆利克从不以死抗争，如果他不能战斗、不能说话或不能以爬行的方式摆脱危险的处境，他就会投降。如果角色们打败了阿姆利克的保镖并把他囚禁起来，他就会听从命令，直到有机会逃脱。低灯笼 \"的工作人员不会进行干预。",

She watched in disbelief as the Companion's light went out, turning black as the city appeared to crumble and sink below the horizon—a horrific image that Reya has been unable to get out of her mind. She returned to Elturel to find a crater where the city once stood, then took it upon herself to lead a group of fearful refugees west to Baldur's Gate. Before the Flaming Fist closed the city gates, Reya and a handful of others managed to sneak inside, but they didn't get far before a group of Flaming Fist soldiers confronted them. The refugees scattered, and Reya soon found herself cornered by a Flaming Fist thug. She wounded the soldier with her longsword, fled down an alley, and stole a cloak to better conceal her armor and weapons. She's been a wanted fugitive ever since.": "城市消失时，雷亚正在埃尔图勒以北几英里处训练。她难以置信地看着同伴的光芒熄灭，当城市似乎崩溃并沉入地平线以下时，她变成了黑色--这是雷亚一直无法忘怀的恐怖画面。她回到Elturel，发现城市曾经存在的一个火山口，然后自告奋勇地带领一群恐惧的难民向西前往Baldur之门。在火焰之拳关闭城门之前，雷亚和其他少数人设法潜入城内，但他们没走多远就被一群火焰之拳的士兵撞见了。难民们四散而逃，雷亚很快发现自己被一个火焰拳头的暴徒逼到了角落。她用长剑打伤了那个士兵，逃到一条小巷里，并偷了一件斗篷以更好地隐藏她的盔甲和武器。从那时起，她就成了一名被通缉的逃犯。",
	"Reya hasn't been in Baldur's Gate long, but she's quickly concluded that the city is a cesspool of corruption with death lurking around every foggy corner. She's investigating a rumor that {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}, the high overseer of Elturel, is in the city. Reya hasn't confirmed whether the rumor is true, but reports say that Kreeg was seen in the company of four guards employed by the Vanthampur family. The Vanthampur estate is located in the Upper City, beyond her reach, but she has learned that {@creature Amrik Vanthampur|BGDIA} runs a business out of the Low Lantern. She aims to question him about the veracity of the rumor.": "雷亚在博德之门的时间并不长，但她很快就得出结论，这个城市是一个腐败的粪坑，每个雾气弥漫的角落都潜藏着死亡。她正在调查一个谣言，说Elturel的高级监督员{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}在这个城市里。雷亚还没有证实这个传言是否属实，但有报道说，有人看到克雷格与范坦普尔家族雇佣的四名卫兵在一起。范坦普尔庄园位于上城，超出了她的能力范围，但她了解到{@creature Amrik Vanthampur|BGDIA}在 \"低灯笼 \"外经营着一项业务。她的目的是要询问他这个传言的真实性。",
	"Reya knows nothing of {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}'s treachery. She simply wants answers regarding what happened to Elturel. If it's possible to save the city, the Hellrider is prepared to do whatever it takes to do so.

	"If the characters appear valiant and forthright, Reya takes a liking to them immediately. Once she realizes that her quest parallels theirs, she asks to join them as they prepare to visit Vanthampur Villa.": "如果这些人物显得英勇和直率，雷亚就会立即对他们产生好感。一旦她意识到她的追求与他们的追求相类似，她就要求加入他们，因为他们准备访问范坦普尔别墅。",
	"If the characters reveal that they're working for the Flaming Fist, Reya draws her longsword in a panic, expecting to have to defend herself. Characters can allay her fears by saying they have no intention of arresting her. In the interests of full disclosure, Reya admits that she's being hunted by the Flaming Fist for an \"unfortunate altercation\" that wasn't entirely her fault.": "如果人物透露他们在为火焰之拳工作，雷亚就会惊慌失措地拔出长剑，以为要为自己辩护。角色可以通过说他们无意逮捕她来消除她的恐惧。为了全面披露，雷亚承认，她被火焰之拳追捕是因为一次 \"不幸的争吵\"，但这并不完全是她的错。",
	"Reya is willing to join the adventuring party if the characters let her. She has no friends in Baldur's Gate, and she can't reach Vanthampur Villa in the heavily guarded Upper City without help.

	"Twenty {@creature Guard||guards} of the Watch vigilantly are posted at every gate to the Upper City. If the characters present the badges given to them by Captain Zodge, the Watch members let them pass through the gates, even if they are accompanied by a prisoner or a known fugitive such as Reya Mantlemorn. Any character without a badge is questioned and required to pay a gate toll of 2 cp.": "20名(%0)守望者警惕地驻扎在上城的每一个大门。如果人物出示了佐奇队长给他们的徽章，守望者就会让他们通过城门，即使他们身边有囚犯或已知的逃犯，如雷亚-曼特莱蒙。任何没有徽章的人物都会受到盘问，并被要求支付2cp的门费。",

She is barrel-bodied, with strong hands and forearms that speak to her beginnings as a manual laborer. Her youth was spent in the cellars and sewers of Baldur's Gate, repairing pipes and clearing out the city's filth. Thalamra rose from such lowly work to become the minister of the city's sewers and waterworks. Now she dresses in the finery that suits her station as a duke of Baldur's Gate.": "塔拉姆拉-范坦普尔是一个狡猾的、崇拜魔鬼的女人，年过六旬的她可以毫不退缩地盯着一只地狱猎犬。她身材魁梧，有一双强壮的手和前臂，说明她最初是个体力劳动者。她的青春是在博德之门的地窖和下水道中度过的，修理管道和清理城市的污秽。塔拉姆拉从这样卑微的工作中脱颖而出，成为城市下水道和水厂的部长。现在，她穿着适合她作为博德之门公爵的身份的华丽服饰。",
	"Thalamra is a widow three times over, and each of her dead husbands was kind enough to give her a son. Her oldest boy, Thurstwell, is a pale and sullen recluse in his forties.

Thurstwell resents both of them—Amrik for being their mother's favorite, and Mortlock for being a monstrous dolt.": "塔拉姆拉是个三代寡妇，她死去的每一个丈夫都好心给她生了一个儿子。她最大的儿子瑟斯韦尔是一个四十多岁、脸色苍白、闷闷不乐的隐士。他是一个名副其实的闭门不出的人，他用小精灵监视他的兄弟Amrik和Mortlock。瑟斯韦尔憎恨他们两个--阿姆利克是他们母亲的最爱，而莫特洛克是一个畸形的傻瓜。",
	"Thurstwell's real problem is that his mother doesn't see him as her successor, and is grooming Amrik to fill that role. Despite his jealousy, Thurstwell would never visit harm upon Amrik for fear of incurring his mother's wrath. Mortlock is a different matter, as it's been made abundantly clear that Thalamra would disown him had she not agreed to the dying wish of her third husband to look after Mortlock despite his countless imperfections.": "瑟斯韦尔真正的问题是，他的母亲没有把他看作是她的继承人，而是在培养阿姆利克来填补这个角色。尽管他很嫉妒，但瑟斯韦尔绝不会伤害阿姆利克，因为他害怕招致他母亲的愤怒。莫特洛克是个不同的问题，因为已经很清楚地表明，如果不是她同意她第三任丈夫的遗愿，尽管莫特洛克有无数的不完美，她也会不承认他。",
	"Vanthampur Villa is a stately stone edifice with a detached stable house. Both buildings have sloped rooftops covered with red clay tiles. A 12-foot-high stone wall encloses the villa.

	"This gallery contains an eclectic collection of tapestries, paintings, and alabaster busts on pedestals meant to impress guests.

	"The easiest option is to have the NPCs stay back and out of the way, limiting their options to following the characters or hiding from enemies. During fights, you can effectively forget about those NPCs, assuming that the most capable among them are dealing with minor threats in the background while the adventurers handle the potent foes. You can also have combat-worthy NPCs join the fight, if you're up for running them.

	"Although the forces of Avernus are occupied driving back the demonic attack from the River Styx, a few teams of devils have been ordered to infiltrate Elturel, sow chaos among the surviving citizenry, reap the souls of any mortals they find, and test the city's defenses.

As such, they have decided to mount a quick and decisive strike against it.": "虽然Avernus的部队正忙着驱赶来自冥河的恶魔攻击，但有几队恶魔被命令潜入Elturel，在幸存的市民中制造混乱，收割他们发现的任何凡人的灵魂，并测试该城市的防御。其中一些先遣队的成员注意到，高堂似乎是城市防御和生存努力的中心。因此，他们决定对它进行一次快速和决定性的打击。",
	"As the characters approach the High Hall, they see that a devilish assault on the fortress's cathedral is underway. The characters can enter the fray, defeat the perpetrators, and help bring temporary stability to the situation.

	"Shortly after Elturel was pulled into Avernus, a meteor hurled through the High Hall, collapsing the offices and residences of those who could best organize a defense of the city. Most of the leaders of Elturel were killed by the meteor, but Grand Duke Ravengard of Baldur's Gate and his retinue were spared the devastation. Ravengard immediately took control of the situation, marshaled Elturel's remaining forces, and set out a plan to protect the city. Ravengard's forces couldn't save the eastern part of the city, and more frequent demonic and devilish incursions have worn away at their control of the western portion.": "在Elturel被拉入Avernus后不久，一颗流星投掷到市政厅，使那些能够最好地组织城市防御的人的办公室和住所倒塌。大多数Elturel的领导人都被流星杀死了，但Baldur's Gate的Ravengard大公爵和他的随从却免于这场灾难。拉文加德立即控制了局势，调集Elturel的剩余部队，并制定了一个保护城市的计划。拉文加德的部队没能拯救城市的东部，更频繁的恶魔和魔鬼的入侵已经消磨了他们对西部的控制。",
	"The survivors here—including the last of the city's leadership—have taken up residence in the cathedral part of the High Hall, perhaps the most secure and sturdy edifice left in Elturel.

	"As the DM, you can decide where the characters encounter each of these groups. These encounters are meant to be run separately, although running two encounters back-to-back with no chance for the characters to rest or heal can be a good challenge for a powerful party.": "作为管理员，你可以决定角色在哪里遇到这些团体。这些遭遇战是要分开进行的，尽管在没有机会让角色休息或治疗的情况下背靠背地进行两个遭遇战，对一个强大的队伍来说也是一个很好的挑战。",
	"If you want to keep these encounters simple and straightforward, you can have them take place in locations with no strange effects or hazards.

	"A {@creature spined devil} leads three human brigands (use the {@creature bandit captain} stat block to represent them) on a rampage. The brigands were driven mad by the journey to Avernus, and have now pledged themselves to their spined devil master.

	"The story picks up where it left off in {@adventure chapter 2|BGDIA|2}, with the characters embarking on a quest to save Elturel while {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} and Reya Mantlemorn stay behind to organize survivors and defend the city. {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} guides the characters to Fort Knucklebone, home to a pair of kenku junk scavengers named {@creature Chukka|BGDIA} and {@creature Clonk|BGDIA}, whom {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} thinks can provide assistance. {@creature Mad Maggie|BGDIA}, the night hag who runs the fort, oversees the construction and repair of infernal war machines. If the characters agree to make a deal with the night hag, they can acquire one or more of these vehicles. {@creature Mad Maggie|BGDIA} can also help {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} unlock some of her forgotten memories.": "故事从{@adventure chapter 2|BGDIA|2}中结束的地方开始，人物踏上了拯救Elturel的征程，而{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}和Reya Mantlemorn则留下来组织幸存者并保卫城市。{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}引导人物来到Knucklebone堡，那里有一对名叫{@creature Chukka|BGDIA}和{@creature Clonk|BGDIA}的肯库垃圾清道夫，{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}认为他们可以提供帮助。{@creature Mad Maggie|BGDIA}是管理该堡垒的夜行者，负责监督地狱战争机器的建造和维修。如果人物同意与夜魔女做交易，他们可以获得一种或多种这样的交通工具。{@creature Mad Maggie|BGDIA}还可以帮助{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}解开她一些被遗忘的记忆。",
	"From Fort Knucklebone, {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} guides the characters to the place where she thinks the {@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA} is hidden: Haruman's Hill. There, they meet Jander Sunstar, a vampire with some information. They also meet Jander's torturer, Haruman—a fallen Hellrider and one of Zariel's infernal generals. {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} eventually realizes she's made a grave mistake and led the characters to the wrong place. She suggests two possible paths going forward: the {@adventure Path of Demons|BGDIA|4} and the {@adventure Path of Devils|BGDIA|5}. Each path features a number of locations across Avernus that the characters must visit in sequence to learn where Zariel's sword is hidden.": "从克努克本堡，{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}引导人物到她认为藏有{@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}的地方：哈鲁曼之山。在那里，他们遇到了詹德-太阳星，一个拥有一些信息的吸血鬼。他们还遇到了詹德的拷问者，哈鲁曼--一个堕落的地狱骑士和扎里尔的地狱将军之一。{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}最终意识到她犯了一个严重的错误，把这些人物引到了错误的地方。她提出了两条可能的前进道路：{@adventure Path of Demons|BGDIA|4}和{@adventure Path of Devils|BGDIA|5}。每条路都有一些遍布阿弗纳斯的地点，人物必须依次访问，以了解扎里尔的剑藏在哪里。",
	"At any time during their exploration of Avernus, the characters and {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} might encounter the Wandering Emporium, a marketplace that wanders Avernus on the backs of giant infernal war machines. The Wandering Emporium provides a good place for the characters to rest and gather supplies that are otherwise hard to find in Avernus.": "在探索Avernus的过程中，人物和{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}可能会遇到Wandering Emporium，一个骑着巨大的地狱战争机器在Avernus游荡的集市。流浪商店为人物提供了一个休息和收集物资的好地方，否则在Avernus很难找到。",
	"Avernus serves as the front line of the great clash between the evil forces of chaos and law known as the Blood War. Demons from the Abyss use the River Styx to enter Avernus, where they hurl themselves against infernal legions of devils.": "阿弗纳斯是被称为血战的混乱和法律的邪恶力量之间的巨大冲突的前线。来自深渊的恶魔利用冥河进入阿弗纳斯，在那里他们与地狱般的恶魔军团展开激烈的斗争。",
	"Avernus was not always the blasted, war-torn battlefield it is today. Long ago, it was a plane of lush gardens and bucolic beauty created by Asmodeus to tempt mortals. The intrusion of the River Styx followed by endless waves of slavering demons destroyed this paradise, leaving layer upon layer of bones, ruins, and shattered war machines. Pieces of cities stolen from other planes, tiny remnants of Avernus's lost beauty, evidence of destroyed celestial armies, and tombs of ancient travelers all dot the Avernian wasteland.": "阿弗纳斯并不总是像今天这样被炸毁、被战争蹂躏的战场。很久以前，它是一个由阿斯莫德创造的拥有郁郁葱葱的花园和田园风光的平面，用来诱惑凡人。冥河的入侵，以及无尽的贪婪的恶魔浪潮摧毁了这个天堂，留下了一层又一层的白骨、废墟和破碎的战争机器。从其他星球偷来的城市碎片，阿弗纳斯失去的美丽的微小残余，被摧毁的天体军队的证据，以及古代旅行者的坟墓，都点缀在阿弗尼亚的荒地上。",
	"Avernus is not a place expressly for the punishment of evil souls; instead, it represents a \"next level\" for evil souls after the end of their wicked lives as mortals. The Nine Hells allows souls to exist in a concentrated form, where they can work through their spiritual bondage to express their dark desires such as cruelty, covetousness, the need to control, the craving for power, and uncontrolled greed. Hell offers an eternity of fulfillment from the most insignificant desires to the seven deadly sins. Every shred of evil is used in the Nine Hells, and each layer specializes in some way to accommodate and exploit the vices and weaknesses of mortals. The devils of Avernus seek to exploit pride and wrath, promising the aggrieved, enraged, and egotistical the power to fulfill their darkest obsessions. Such fulfillment, however, comes at a price.": "阿弗纳斯（Avernus）并不是一个明确用于惩罚邪恶灵魂的地方；相反，它代表了邪恶灵魂在结束他们作为凡人的邪恶生活后的 \"下一个层次\"。九层地狱允许灵魂以集中的形式存在，在那里他们可以通过精神束缚来表达他们的黑暗欲望，如残忍、贪婪、控制的需要、对权力的渴望和不受控制的贪婪。地狱提供了一个永恒的满足，从最微不足道的欲望到七宗罪。每一丝邪恶都被用在九层地狱中，每一层都以某种方式专门适应和利用凡人的恶习和弱点。阿弗纳斯的魔鬼们试图利用骄傲和愤怒，承诺给那些受委屈的、被激怒的和自负的人以力量，以实现他们最黑暗的痴迷。然而，这种满足是有代价的。",
	"Anyone entering Avernus finds a battlefield unlike anywhere else in existence. Evidence of past carnage, such as the ruins of enormous war machines and fields of bleached bones, stretches across the horizon. Through it all, the River Styx winds its way across the plane as knots of demons and devils skirmish along its fetid banks.": "任何进入Avernus的人都会发现一个不同于其他地方的战场。过去大屠杀的证据，如巨大的战争机器的废墟和漂白的骨头田，延伸到地平线上。在这一切中，冥河蜿蜒地穿过平面，恶魔和魔鬼在其腥臭的河岸上展开争斗。",
	"Most devils in Avernus serve Zariel, though other Lords of the Nine send forces here to help repel demonic invaders. Devils who are not part of Zariel's legions serve as emissaries from the other layers or as spies for archdevils seeking signs of weakness that they can exploit to further their dreams of power.": "阿弗纳斯的大多数魔鬼都为扎里尔服务，尽管其他九大领主也会派军队来这里帮助击退恶魔的入侵者。不属于扎里尔军团的魔鬼则作为其他层级的使者，或作为大恶魔的间谍，寻找他们可以利用的弱点，以推进他们的权力梦想。",
	"By bringing Elturel to Avernus and potentially gaining a choke hold on Baldur's Gate, Zariel aims to capture as many evil mortals as she can, turn them into devils, and swell the ranks of her battle-depleted legions. Through {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}, Zariel found a way to exploit the gullible nature of mortals by appealing to their need to follow a leader who proclaims spiritual power. Because of Kreeg, the residents of Elturel are bound by the Creed Resolute to fight and die for Zariel in her endless war.": "通过将Elturel带到Avernus，并有可能获得对Baldur's Gate的控制权，Zariel旨在尽可能多地捕获邪恶的凡人，将他们变成魔鬼，并扩大她的战斗力下降的军团的队伍。通过{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}，扎里尔找到了一种方法，利用凡人容易受骗的天性，吸引他们需要追随一个宣称有精神力量的领袖。因为克雷格，Elturel的居民被坚决的信条所约束，在她无休止的战争中为扎里尔战斗和牺牲。",
	"Despite the conflict within the diabolical ranks, Zariel runs a tight ship and instills fear in her legions. Retribution against those who attempt to betray her is swift and terrible.": "尽管恶魔的队伍中存在冲突，但扎里尔管理得很严密，并在她的军团中灌输了恐惧。对那些试图背叛她的人的报应是迅速而可怕的。",
	"Souls are the most prized commodities in the Nine Hells. The Blood War taxes Zariel's armies, so she must ensure a fresh supply of souls as replacements. To this end, Zariel looks for evildoers in the mortal realms who can deliver more souls to her.": "灵魂是九层地狱中最珍贵的商品。血战给扎里尔的军队带来了沉重的负担，所以她必须确保有新鲜的灵魂供应作为替代。为此，扎里尔在凡间寻找能够向她提供更多灵魂的恶人。",
	"Because devils can't simply walk out of Avernus and step onto the Material Plane, they must rely on minions such as cultists and evil wizards, who can contact them and do their bidding in exchange for wealth and power. A select group of devils and mortal followers who seek to cause strife and destabilize harmonious communities serve as Zariel's chief corruptors. By funding evil groups, making and distributing weapons, and causing random acts of violence in the name of some enemy to ignite the spark of war, devils swell the capacity for mortals to commit acts of evil, corrupting souls by the thousands and thus ensuring the legions of devils are full of diabolic soldiers for the Blood War.": "因为魔鬼不能简单地走出阿弗纳斯，踏上物质界，他们必须依靠邪教徒和邪恶的巫师等爪牙，这些人可以与他们联系，为他们服务，以换取财富和权力。一群精选的魔鬼和凡人追随者，他们试图引起纷争，破坏和谐社区的稳定，成为扎里尔的主要腐败者。通过资助邪恶团体，制造和分发武器，并以某些敌人的名义引发随机的暴力行为来点燃战争的火花，魔鬼们扩大了凡人实施邪恶行为的能力，腐蚀了成千上万的灵魂，从而确保魔鬼军团充满了血战的邪恶士兵。",
	"Under constant pressure from both the Abyss and her infernal peers, Zariel and her high-ranking vassals work to keep her armies constantly in the fight. Zariel's wrath and pride have limits, however, and this offers her an opportunity for redemption. Zariel has, in a twisted way, achieved her dream as an angel—to fight face-to-face against the demon hordes in the Blood War. But the burden is a heavy one, and if given the chance, Zariel could be convinced to set it aside, release Elturel, and return to the light with a completely transformed perspective.": "在来自深渊和她的地狱同僚的持续压力下，扎里尔和她的高级臣子们努力使她的军队不断处于战斗状态。然而，扎里尔的愤怒和骄傲是有限度的，这为她提供了一个救赎的机会。扎丽尔以一种扭曲的方式实现了她作为天使的梦想--在血战中面对面地与恶魔群作战。但这是一个沉重的负担，如果有机会，Zariel可以被说服把它放在一边，释放Elturel，并以完全转变的观点回到光明中。",
	"Whereas demons attack in disorganized mobs, relying on shock and overwhelming numbers to carry the day, devils organize into a basic unit called a legion. Each legion contains one thousand devils organized as follows:": "恶魔以无组织的暴徒形式进攻，依靠冲击和压倒性的数量来完成任务，而魔鬼则组织成一个基本单位，称为军团。每个军团包含一千名魔鬼，组织方式如下。",
	"1 legion = 10 cohorts, commanded by a legate": "1个军团=10个队列，由一名议员指挥",
	"1 cohort = 10 lances, commanded by a signifier": "1支队伍=10支长矛，由一个标志者指挥",
	"1 lance = 10 devils, commanded by an optio": "1支长枪=10个魔鬼，由一名操作人员指挥。",
	"Ranks of miserable {@creature Lemure||lemures} and {@creature Nupperibo|MTF|nupperibos} compose the base of dreg legions, while {@creature Bearded Devil||bearded devils} and {@creature Merregon|MTF|merregons} make up the bulk of regular legions. Each legion sports a unique name, usually denoting its purpose and numerical designation. Examples include the following:": "悲惨的{@creature Lemure||lemures}和{@creature Nupperibo|MTF|nupperibos}军团构成了渣滓军团的基础，而{@creature Bearded Devil||bearded devils}和{@creature Merregon|MTF|merregons}则构成了普通军团的主体。每个军团都有一个独特的名字，通常表示其目的和数字名称。例子包括以下几个。",

	"47th Dreg Legion, \"Piteous Fodder\"": "第47届Dreg军团，\"可怜的炮灰\"",
	"The hellscape of Avernus sits under hideous clouds that obscure the vault of the sky, from which the occasional meteor streaks before crashing into the ground. Ambient light continually swells up from just below the horizon as though lit by nine setting suns, yet no actual celestial bodies fill the sky—no sun, moons, or stars. This constant twilight makes it difficult for the denizens of Avernus to track the passage of time.": "Avernus的地狱景象坐落在可怕的云层之下，遮蔽了天穹，偶尔有流星从那里划过，然后坠入地面。周围的光线不断地从地平线下涌出，仿佛被九个夕阳照亮，但天空中却没有真正的天体--没有太阳、月亮或星星。这种持续的黄昏使阿弗纳斯的居民难以追踪时间的流逝。",
	"The atmosphere reeks of brimstone and burning tar, and hot gusts of wind shriek across the hellscape to scour the land below. Sometimes these winds swirl into immense sandstorms, which can strip flesh from bone and plunge everything into darkness.": "大气中弥漫着硫磺和焦油的味道，热风呼啸着穿过地狱景象，刮向下面的土地。有时，这些风会卷起巨大的沙尘暴，使人骨肉分离，并使一切陷入黑暗。",
	"Biting flies, hellwasps, and blood-sucking stirges patrol the air, hunting for any source of blood to feed on. Swarms of them can grow so large that they blacken the sky and deafen the ears with the sound of their wings. On the ground, wandering bands of nupperibos—blind, bloated castaways of the damned—move in the thousands like living lakes of groaning flesh in their agonizing search for food. Bone fields, quicksand, bubbling tar pits, lakes of lava, canyons of wailing souls, and salt flats made from the tears of the damned all await those who wander the hellscape.": "咬人的苍蝇、地狱蜂和吸血马蜂在空中巡逻，寻找任何可以吸食的血源。它们成群结队，可以使天空变黑，翅膀发出的声音使人耳聋。在地面上，Nupperibos--盲目的、臃肿的被诅咒的弃儿--成群结队地移动，就像呻吟的肉体的活湖，痛苦地寻找食物。骨场、流沙、冒泡的焦油坑、熔岩湖、哭泣的灵魂峡谷，以及由被诅咒者的眼泪制成的盐滩，都在等待着那些在地狱里游荡的人。",
	"The River Styx courses through the Lower Planes, frustrating every attempt to map it or predict its course. Getting lost while sailing the Styx isn't the only danger the river presents. Simply tasting or touching its waters can shatter a creature's intellect and personality, as well as strip away its memories. Certain fiends are immune to the river's effects, but most creatures have no defense against it.": "冥河在下层平面中穿行，让每一个试图绘制它或预测它的路线的人感到沮丧。在冥河上航行时迷路并不是冥河带来的唯一危险。仅仅是品尝或触摸冥河的水，就可以粉碎一个生物的智力和个性，并剥夺其记忆。某些魔族对冥河的影响有免疫力，但大多数生物对它没有防御能力。",
	"Unless immune to the river's effects, a creature that drinks from the Styx or enters the river is targeted by a {@spell feeblemind} spell (save DC 20). A creature must repeat the saving throw whenever it starts its turn in the river, until it fails the save. A feebleminded creature can drink from the Styx and swim in its waters without suffering any additional deleterious effects.": "除非对河流的影响免疫，否则从冥河喝水或进入河流的生物会被一个{@spell feeblemind}的法术所攻击（保存DC20）。每当生物在河中开始行动时，都必须重复这个蓄力动作，直到它蓄力失败。虚弱的生物可以喝下冥河的水，也可以在河中游泳，而不会受到任何额外的有害影响。",
	"Water taken from the River Styx loses its potency after 24 hours, becoming a harmless, foul-tasting liquid. However, {@creature Arcanaloth||arcanaloths}, {@creature Night Hag||night hags}, and other fell creatures might know rituals that can prolong the water's potency, at your discretion.": "从冥河取来的水在24小时后就会失去效力，变成一种无害的、有臭味的液体。然而，{@creature Arcanaloth||arcanaloths}、{@creature Night Hag||night hags}和其他堕落生物可能知道一些仪式，可以延长水的效力，由你决定。",

To stave off this decline, Arkhan needs to use the {@item Hand of Vecna} to snuff the life out of good-aligned creatures. If the characters try to cut a deal with Arkhan—for a vial of Tiamat's blood or help contacting the dragon queen herself—Arkhan demands the sacrifice of a good-aligned creature in exchange. {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} is an ideal candidate, as is the unicorn Mooncolor (see \"{@area Demon Zapper|230|x}\").

	"In the longer term, the characters might also have loose ends in Baldur's Gate to take care of, especially if any villains in {@adventure chapter 1|BGDIA|1} were left alive to continue their dark plots.": "从长远来看，这些人物在《博德之门》中也可能有未了结的事情要处理，特别是如果{@adventure chapter 1|BGDIA|1}中的任何反派人物被留下继续他们的黑暗计划。",
	"Even if the tale of the two cities has been successfully completed to the characters' satisfaction, the events of the adventure continue to play out in Baldur's Gate and Elturel after the fact. In particular, if Grand Duke Ravengard survives and returns with Elturel, the survivors of the city will be greatly in his debt. Ravengard's efforts to defend the city should dramatically change the political landscape of Baldur's Gate and Elturel, ushering in an era of detente, if not full friendship and alliance, between the two cities.": "即使两座城市的故事已经成功完成，让人物满意，冒险的事件也会在事后继续在博德之门和Elturel上演。特别是，如果Ravengard大公幸存下来并带着Elturel回来，那么城市的幸存者将大大地欠下他的债。Ravengard保卫城市的努力应该会极大地改变博德之门和Elturel的政治格局，使两座城市之间迎来一个缓和的时代，如果不是完全的友谊和联盟的话。",
	"At this grim juncture, the characters' only hope is to defeat Zariel or to bend the knee in fealty. Killing Zariel frees the citizens of Elturel from infernal bondage. The characters might choose this endgame intentionally, or they could be forced to fight Zariel if they fail to redeem her.": "在这个严峻的关头，人物的唯一希望就是打败扎里尔或屈膝效忠。杀死扎里尔可以使Elturel的公民摆脱地狱的束缚。人物可能会有意选择这个结局，也可能在未能救赎扎里尔的情况下被迫与之战斗。",
	"{@creature Baphomet|MTF} and {@creature Yeenoghu|MTF} are fighting to claim Avernus for themselves, and {@creature Kostchtchie|BGDIA} (assuming the characters released him in {@area chapter 3|22a|x}) wants his hammer back. None of them can be trusted. Demon lords are savagery incarnate, and they take orders from no one.": "{@creature Baphomet|MTF}和{@creature Yeenoghu|MTF}正在为自己争夺Avernus，而{@creature Kostchtchie|BGDIA}（假设角色在{@area chapter 3|22a|x}中释放了他）想要回他的锤子。他们都不能被信任。恶魔领主是野蛮的化身，他们不接受任何人的命令。",
	"The extent to which Baphomet, {@creature Kostchtchie|BGDIA}, and Yeenoghu are present in Avernus makes it easy for characters to commune with any of these demon lords using {@spell contact other plane} spells or similar magic.": "巴弗灭、{@creature Kostchtchie|BGDIA}和耶诺古在Avernus的存在程度使得角色很容易使用{@spell contact other plane}法术或类似的魔法与这些恶魔领主中的任何一个沟通。",

	"{@creature Bel|BGDIA}'s aim is to let the characters try to redeem Zariel by helping them retrieve her sword. {@creature Bel|BGDIA} knows Zariel's redemption is a long shot, which is why he also gives characters a means to unlock the Companion. Freeing the planetar trapped within the Companion denies Zariel her latest prize—the city of Elturel—and makes her look inept, which is the best {@creature Bel|BGDIA} can hope for.": "{@creature Bel|BGDIA}的目的是让角色通过帮助他们找回扎丽尔的剑来尝试赎罪。{@creature Bel|BGDIA}知道Zariel的救赎是一个漫长的过程，这就是为什么他也给了角色一个解锁同伴的方法。解救被困在同伴中的星球人，会使扎丽尔失去她最新的奖赏--Elturel城，并使她看起来很无能，这是{@creature Bel|BGDIA}所能希望的最好结果。",
	"The {@creature pit fiend} Gargauth would like nothing more than to be released from its prison and replace Zariel as Lord of Avernus. If the characters possess the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}, they can free Gargauth as described in the item's description (see {@adventure Appendix C|BGDIA|12|{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}}).": "{@creature pit fiend} Gargauth最想做的就是被释放出监狱，取代Zariel成为Avernus的主人。如果人物拥有{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}，他们可以按照物品描述中的方法释放加加思（见{@adventure Appendix C|BGDIA|12|{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}}）。",
	"If released, Gargauth thanks the characters through tears of mirth. The pit fiend's first act is to produce a contract out of thin air, claiming that it will aid the characters in their quest to destroy Zariel if they sign it. The contract is full of convoluted text, and is summarized in its final clause: \"I, the undersigned, agree to form a compact with Gargauth, joining with it to destroy the archdevil Zariel. While bound by this compact, no intentional harm shall befall either party by the other party's hand, without voiding this agreement.\"": "如果被释放，加加斯会通过欢笑的眼泪来感谢这些角色。坑魔的第一个行为是凭空产生了一份合同，声称如果他们签署了这份合同，它将帮助角色们完成消灭扎里尔的任务。契约中充满了错综复杂的文字，并在其最后条款中进行了总结。\"我，下面的签名者，同意与Gargauth签订契约，与它一起消灭大恶魔Zariel。在受此契约约束的同时，任何一方不得故意伤害另一方，否则本协议无效。\"",
	"Gargauth takes joy in subverting ill-worded contracts and betraying those bound by them. Notably, the contract presented lasts only until Zariel is destroyed, after which point Gargauth intends to tear the adventurers limb from limb. Clever adventurers can subvert the pit fiend's betrayal by ensuring Zariel's capture, banishment, or some other nonlethal defeat.": "加戈斯以颠覆言辞不当的契约和背叛受其约束的人为乐。值得注意的是，所提出的契约只持续到扎里尔被摧毁为止，之后加古斯打算把冒险家们的肢体撕碎。聪明的冒险者可以通过确保扎里尔被抓、被放逐或其他非致命性的失败来颠覆坑魔的背叛。",
	"In that event, though, Gargauth has left itself an easy out. The only consequence for harming an ally under the terms of the contract is the contract's immediate negation—leaving Gargauth free to do whatever it sees fit. The pit fiend hopes that it can sneak this ruse through unchallenged, and argues fiercely if the characters spot this tricky phrase and demand its removal from the contract.": "不过，在这种情况下，Gargauth给自己留下了一个简单的出路。根据合同条款，伤害盟友的唯一后果是合同被立即否定--让加尔古斯自由地做它认为合适的事情。坑魔希望它可以不受质疑地悄悄通过这个诡计，如果角色们发现这个棘手的短语并要求将其从合同中删除，它就会激烈地争辩。",
	"While the head of Zariel would be a grand trophy, a trophy isn't enough to sway Arkhan. The characters must convince him that he can rule Avernus in Zariel's stead, with Tiamat by his side and armies of abishai and infernal dragons at his back. After contemplating this notion, Arkhan raises the {@item Hand of Vecna} and boasts, \"With this hand, I shall tear Zariel's head from her shoulders and rule Avernus with my queen at my side.\"": "虽然扎里尔的头颅是一个伟大的战利品，但一个战利品并不足以动摇阿克汗。角色们必须说服他，他可以代替扎里尔统治阿弗纳斯，在他身边有提亚马特，在他背后有阿比沙和地狱龙的军队。在考虑了这个想法之后，阿克汗举起了{@item Hand of Vecna}，并吹嘘道：\"用这只手，我将把扎丽尔的头从她的肩膀上扯下来，在我的女王身边统治阿弗纳斯。\"",
	"Arkhan declares that he will muster an army and depose Zariel in ten days. Exactly ten days later, two hundred {@creature white abishai|MTF} fly from Arkhan's tower toward Zariel's current location, with Arkhan leading the charge on the back of Asojano the {@creature chimera}, and {@creature Torogar Steelfist|BGDIA} by his side, carried on the back of Chango the {@creature manticore}. Arkhan's army is bolstered by five chromatic dragons—one adult dragon of each color—sent by Tiamat to help ensure victory. If they so choose, the characters can join Arkhan. The abishai and the dragons engage Zariel's legions while Arkhan, Torogar, and the characters challenge the archdevil herself. This battle can play out as part of the \"{@area Endgame in Elturel|340|x}\" section described at the end of this chapter.": "阿克汗宣布，他将在十天内召集军队并废黜扎里尔。整整十天后，两百名{@creature white abishai|MTF}从阿克汗的塔中飞向扎里尔现在的位置，阿克汗在{@creature chimera}阿索亚诺的背上带头冲锋，{@creature Torogar Steelfist|BGDIA}在他身边，由{@creature manticore}昌戈背负。阿克汗的军队得到了提亚马特派来的五条色龙的支持，每条色龙都有一条成年龙，以帮助确保胜利。如果他们选择的话，人物可以加入阿克汗。阿比莎和龙与扎里尔的军团交战，而阿克汗、托罗格和人物则向大恶魔本人发起挑战。这场战斗可以作为本章末尾描述的\"{@area Endgame in Elturel|340|x} \"部分的一部分进行。",
	"The characters might decide after meeting Zariel that they wish to serve her, joining her army and smiting demons in the Blood War. They also might wind up serving her if they fail to redeem her and wish to live.": "人物在见到扎里尔后可能会决定为她服务，加入她的军队，在血战中消灭恶魔。如果他们没能救赎她并希望活下去，他们也可能最终为她服务。",
	"With no one to sway Zariel from her path to absolute damnation, Zariel demands that the characters give her the {@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA} if they possess it. After she claims the sword, Zariel holds it aloft and shatters it (see \"{@area Relinquishing the Sword|337|x}\").": "由于没有人可以动摇扎里尔的道路，扎里尔要求人物把{@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}交给她，如果他们拥有它。在她认领了这把剑之后，扎里尔高举着它并将其击碎（见\"{@area Relinquishing the Sword|337|x}\"）。",
	"For Zariel to fall beyond redemption is the worst outcome for {@creature Lulu|BGDIA}. This unimaginable tragedy shatters the hollyphant's mind, leaving {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} insane. Roll or choose the specific effects of her madness from the {@table long-term madness||Long-Term Madness table} in {@adventure chapter 8|DMG|-1} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, but this madness can be overcome only by a {@spell greater restoration} spell or similar magic.": "对于扎里尔来说，堕落到无法救赎的地步是{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}最糟糕的结果。这个难以想象的悲剧击碎了冬青象的心灵，让{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}变得疯狂。从{@adventure chapter 8|DMG|-1}的{@table long-term madness||Long-Term Madness table}中滚动或选择她疯狂的具体效果，但这种疯狂只能通过{@spell greater restoration}的咒语或类似的魔法来克服。",
	"If Zariel is redeemed or killed, the first layer of the Nine Hells falls into chaos. You can decide which of the many powerful figures in Avernus make a play to replace Zariel, but any new ruler immediately faces enemies on all sides. The invading armies of Baphomet and Yeenoghu are wreaking havoc and threatening to tear Avernus apart. Moreover, dozens of ambitious greater devils will gleefully try to supplant their new and untested ruler.": "如果扎里尔被赎回或被杀，九层地狱的第一层就会陷入混乱。你可以决定在Avernus的众多强势人物中，哪位可以取代扎里尔，但任何新的统治者都会立即面临四面楚歌。巴弗灭和耶诺古的入侵军队正在进行破坏，并威胁要将阿弗纳斯撕裂。此外，几十个野心勃勃的大魔王将欣喜地试图取代他们新的、未经考验的统治者。",
	"Ruling a layer of the Nine Hells as a mortal is effectively impossible. None of the devils of Avernus will knowingly serve anyone but a superior devil. However, Asmodeus admires ambition. The Lord of the Nine Hells might see a brash and powerful mortal as a worthy replacement for Zariel, offering to transform the character into an NPC archdevil that can rule Avernus. Alternatively, the characters might attempt to claim Avernus on their own terms.": "作为一个凡人，统治九层地狱的一层实际上是不可能的。没有一个阿弗纳斯的魔鬼会明知故犯地服务于任何人，除了一个高级魔鬼。然而，阿斯莫德欣赏野心。九层地狱之主可能会把一个粗鲁而强大的凡人看成是扎里尔的合格替代者，并提议把这个角色改造成一个可以统治阿弗纳斯的NPC大魔鬼。另外，这些人物可能会试图以自己的方式要求获得Avernus。",
	"Idealistic characters seeking to destroy the Nine Hells from the inside out might see this power vacuum as an opportunity to strike a mortal blow to Asmodeus's reign. This might be the only time in cosmic history that such a blindly idealistic cause could succeed. But even if the party can wrest Avernus from Asmodeus's control, this ultimately serves to unite the remaining archdevils, aligning them toward the common goal of reclaiming Avernus—which works to Asmodeus's advantage.": "追求从内到外摧毁九幽地狱的理想主义人物可能会将这一权力真空视为对阿斯莫德的统治进行致命打击的机会。这可能是宇宙历史上唯一一次这种盲目的理想主义事业能够取得成功。但是，即使该党能够从阿斯莫德的控制下夺回阿维纳斯，这最终也会使剩余的大恶魔们团结起来，使他们朝着夺回阿维纳斯的共同目标前进--这对阿斯莫德有利。",
	"Unless the characters intervene, Elturel is inevitably dragged into the River Styx. The memories of its inhabitants will be wiped clean, and their souls will be made into devils—fodder for the front lines of the Blood War.": "除非人物介入，否则Elturel将不可避免地被拖入冥河。这里居民的记忆将被抹去，他们的灵魂将成为血战前线的魔鬼炮灰。",
	"At some point after the destruction of the {@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}, Zariel gives her servants (including the characters if they have taken on that role) the task of forging a new blade for her. This endeavor comes with the following objectives:": "在{@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}被摧毁后的某个时刻，扎里尔给她的仆人（包括角色，如果他们承担了这个角色的话）一个任务，为她锻造一把新刀。这项工作有以下目标。",

	"Zariel needs at least ten pounds of metal or material to make the blade of the sword. Adamantine would do, or a talon from Tiamat.": "扎里尔需要至少10磅的金属或材料来制作剑刃。金刚石也行，或者来自提亚马特的爪子。",
	"To grant the blade its power, the freshly forged weapon must be quenched in the blood of a celestial, a demon lord, and an archdevil. Zariel can supply her own blood, but her servants must collect the other two sacrifices.": "为了赋予这把刀以力量，新锻造的武器必须在一位天人、一位恶魔领主和一位大恶魔的血液中淬炼。扎丽尔可以提供她自己的血，但她的仆人必须收集其他两个祭品。",
	"Eight chains of infernal iron anchor Elturel to its binding posts, and each of those chains must be broken to free the city. If all the chains are broken, Elturel remains floating above Avernus and is no longer drawn toward the River Styx. However, the characters must still find a way to return the city to the Material Plane.": "八条地狱铁链将Elturel固定在捆绑的柱子上，每条铁链都必须被打破才能使城市获得自由。如果所有的铁链都被打破，Elturel将继续漂浮在Avernus之上，不再被吸引到冥河。然而，角色们仍然必须想办法将城市送回物质界。",
	"Tiamat's divine power is mighty enough to break the chains that bind Elturel. {@creature Arkhan the Cruel|BGDIA} is willing to commune with his goddess to this end, but only if the characters offer him a suitably potent gift. In an inscrutable twist, Tiamat decides to aid the characters, and tells Arkhan as such. Read or paraphrase the following:": "提亚马特的神力足以打破束缚艾尔图勒的枷锁。{@creature Arkhan the Cruel|BGDIA}愿意为此目的与他的女神交流，但前提是角色们要为他提供一份合适的有力的礼物。在一个难以捉摸的转折中，提亚马特决定帮助这些角色，并这样告诉阿克汗。阅读或解读以下内容。",
	"A shroud of confusion passes over Arkhan's face, dissolving his bravado. He mutters to Tiamat under his breath, \"Is that wise, my queen?\" Then his eyes darken as his body hangs limp like a puppet cut from its strings. After a moment, Arkhan stands up straight, his eyes glowing with prismatic light. A hungry smile crosses his face, and five voices echo from his mouth, each resonating with the ire of an imprisoned goddess.": "一层迷惑的阴影笼罩着阿肯的脸，消解了他的狂妄。他对提亚马特小声嘀咕道：\"这是明智之举吗，我的女王？\" 然后他的眼睛变黑了，他的身体像被切断了线的木偶一样瘫软下来。过了一会儿，阿克汗站直了身子，他的眼睛闪着棱形的光。一个饥饿的微笑掠过他的脸，五个声音从他的嘴里回响，每一个都是被囚禁的女神的愤怒的共鸣。",
	"\"I will aid you,\" Tiamat growls. \"If your power is enough to threaten Zariel's ambitions, then I have nothing to fear. I can destroy the chains binding Elturel, but you must be present to bear witness to my majesty. Now go. I will know when you are there.\"": "\"我会援助你，\"提亚马特咆哮道。\"如果你的力量足以威胁到扎里尔的野心，那么我就没什么好怕的了。我可以摧毁束缚Elturel的锁链，但你必须在场，见证我的威严。现在去吧。你到了那里我就知道了。\"",
	"When the characters next set foot in Elturel, {@creature Tiamat|RoT} bursts forth from her distant lair and blazes like a meteor across the sky of Avernus. Appearing above the city, she swoops down and focuses her breath weapons on one chain at a time, dealing 67 acid damage, 88 lightning damage, 72 cold damage, and 91 fire damage—more than enough to destroy the chain's links. Once all eight chains are destroyed, Tiamat roars in triumph and departs.": "当人物下一次踏入艾尔图勒时，{@creature Tiamat|RoT}从她遥远的巢穴中冲了出来，像一颗流星一样在阿弗纳斯的天空中闪耀。她出现在城市的上空，俯冲下来，将她的呼吸武器集中在一条链子上，造成67点酸性伤害、88点闪电伤害、72点寒冷伤害和91点火焰伤害--足以摧毁链子的链接。一旦所有八条链子都被摧毁，提亚马特就会发出胜利的怒吼并离开。",
	"{@creature Crokek'toeck|BGDIA} appears near Elturel within 1 hour of the first drop of blood being shed.

The demon can gnaw through a bloodied chain link in 1 minute.": "{@creature Crokek'toeck|BGDIA}在流下第一滴血的1小时内出现在Elturel附近。所有附近的恶魔立即试图杀死这个恶魔，而附近的恶魔则跃跃欲试地去保卫它。当两股对立的力量发生冲突时，(1%)从恶魔身边溜走。恶魔可以在1分钟内咬断一个带血的链环。",
	"The original contract resembles the copy stored in Thavius's {@item infernal puzzle box|BGDIA}: nine square plates of infernal iron linked together by short chains, each plate inseparable from the others and inscribed with the terms of the contract written in Infernal. Casting the contract into the River Styx or immersing it in molten magma of one of Avernus's active volcanoes destroys it instantly.": "契约原件与存放在塔维乌斯{@item infernal puzzle box|BGDIA}的副本相似：九块方形的地狱铁板由短链连接在一起，每块铁板都与其他铁板不可分割，并刻有用地狱语书写的契约条款。将契约投入冥河或浸入阿弗纳斯活火山的熔融岩浆中，就会立即毁掉它。",
	"Destroying Zariel voids all the active contracts she has made with beings across the multiverse. This causes no small amount of cosmic chaos.": "摧毁扎里尔会使她与整个多元宇宙的生命签订的所有有效契约失效。这造成了不小的宇宙混乱。",
	"If the characters killed {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} in Baldur's Gate, he crawled out of the River Styx as a {@creature lemure}. In accordance with the terms of their contract, Zariel promoted him to an {@creature amnizu|MTF}, then confined him in her fortress (see \"{@area Poor Devil: Thavius Kreeg|2b8|x}\"). If Thavius dies in the Nine Hells as a devil, he is permanently dead—but this does not break the full terms of Zariel's contract. Even with the primary signatory dead, the people of Elturel remain bound to Zariel by the Creed Resolute.": "如果人物在《博德之门》中杀死了{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}，他就会作为{@creature lemure}从冥河中爬出来。根据他们的契约条款，扎里尔将他晋升为{@creature amnizu|MTF}，然后将他禁锢在她的堡垒中（见\"{@area Poor Devil: Thavius Kreeg|2b8|x}\"）。如果塔维乌斯在九层地狱中以魔鬼的身份死去，他就会永久死亡--但这并没有破坏扎里尔的合同的全部条款。即使主要的签约者死了，Elturel的人们仍然被坚决的信条约束着与Zariel。",
	"If the characters left Thavius alive in {@adventure chapter 1|BGDIA|1}, they must find a way back to the Material Plane to kill him.

	"If the characters threaten him, Thavius snivels and begs for his life. He also claims to know where the original contract that sealed Elturel's doom is hidden. This is a lie, the claim a desperate ploy to buy time and, hopefully, a chance to escape.": "如果这些人物威胁他，塔维斯就会哭哭啼啼地乞求饶命。他还声称，他知道将艾尔图勒的厄运封存起来的原始合同藏在哪里。这是一个谎言，这个说法是一个绝望的伎俩，以争取时间，并希望有机会逃脱。",
	"If the characters have no other options for dealing with Zariel, one or more of them might be willing to give up everything in order to save the innocent people of Elturel. When a good-aligned paladin or cleric of 10th level or higher performs such a selfless act, the power of that deed is eternally written upon their soul. To creatures that covet souls, this deed blazes like a bonfire in the darkness—and Zariel desires it. Such a character is likely destined to pass into the Upper Planes after death, and as such, they make a handsome prize for an archdevil to shape into a loyal servant of the Nine Hells.": "如果这些人物没有其他办法对付扎里尔，他们中的一个或多个可能愿意放弃一切，以拯救Elturel的无辜人民。当一个10级以上的善良的圣骑士或牧师做出这种无私的行为时，这种行为的力量会永远地写在他们的灵魂上。对于觊觎灵魂的生物来说，这种行为就像黑暗中的篝火一样熊熊燃烧--扎里尔也渴望如此。这样的人物在死后很可能注定要进入上层世界，因此，他们是大恶魔塑造九层地狱忠诚仆人的丰厚奖品。",

	"If the characters try to bargain for Elturel's release without the {@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}, Zariel considers their offer and produces a contract stating that she will release the city in exchange for the sword, delivered without any complications or deceit. {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} rankles at the idea of the characters forging any sort of pact with the archdevil, but holds out hope that Zariel can be redeemed if the sword is brought before her.": "如果人物试图在没有{@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}的情况下为Elturel的释放讨价还价，Zariel会考虑他们的提议，并出示一份合同，说明她将释放城市以换取剑，并且没有任何复杂的情况或欺骗。{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}对人物与大恶魔签订任何形式的契约的想法感到不安，但对扎里尔抱有希望，如果把剑带到她面前，她就能得到救赎。",

	"Centuries ago, the hero Balduran spent years questing in lands across the Sea of Swords and beyond. When finally he returned to his village of Gray Harbor, he brought fantastic wealth with him, much of which he gifted to friends and family. These boons greatly improved Gray Harbor's fortunes, launching businesses, expanding its docks, and seeing the creation of a defensive wall around the town.

	"As the city swelled, questions of law and taxation arose. The community's eldest families—largely those wealthy enough to afford homes within the city walls—came to be known as patriars and grew wary of the influx of strangers settling beyond their walls. The creation of various additional taxes on trade and travel led to violence breaking out between the Upper City—behind the original walls of Gray Harbor—and the Lower City, built on the slopes leading down to the Chionthar River. Patriar houses were ransacked, family heirlooms were lost forever, and heirs were kidnapped, never to be seen again. Gold flowed like blood as families and guilds hired mercenaries to protect them. Only the election of a new group of rulers—known as the dukes and, collectively, as the Council of Four—put the matter to rest. These elected rulers have been a part of the city's governance ever since.": "随着城市的扩大，法律和税收问题也随之而来。社区最年长的家庭--主要是那些富裕到可以在城墙内买得起房子的家庭--被称为爱国者，并对涌入他们城墙外定居的陌生人越来越警惕。对贸易和旅行征收的各种附加税导致了上城--在格雷港原来的城墙后面--和下城--建在通往奇安塔尔河的山坡上--之间爆发了暴力。族长的房子被洗劫一空，传家宝永远失去了，继承人被绑架，再也见不到了。黄金像血一样流淌，因为家庭和行会雇用雇佣兵来保护他们。只有一批新的统治者被选举出来，他们被称为公爵，并被统称为四人会议，才使这件事得以平息。从那时起，这些当选的统治者一直是城市治理的一部分。",
	"Another pillar of order in Baldur's Gate formed when the adventurer Eltan, a noted warrior raised in the area, returned home from exploits abroad. Seeing the chaos that had splintered his beloved city, Eltan united the city's independent mercenary companies under a single banner, that of the Flaming Fist. Eltan used the mercenaries to quash what pockets of disorder he found, punishing lawbreakers for their crimes. Though plenty of theft, blackmail, and assassination continued behind closed doors, the founding of the Flaming Fist marked a new chapter in the city's story.": "博德之门的另一根秩序支柱是在冒险家艾尔坦--一位在当地长大的著名战士--从国外探险归来后形成的。看到他心爱的城市陷入混乱，艾尔坦将城市的独立佣兵公司统一在一面旗帜下，即火焰之拳。埃尔坦利用这些雇佣兵来平息他所发现的混乱地区，惩罚违法者的罪行。尽管大量的盗窃、勒索和暗杀行为仍在闭门进行，但火焰之拳的成立标志着这个城市的故事进入了新的篇章。",
	"Over the years, Baldur's Gate has harbored countless evil schemes and conspiracies. Perhaps the most dastardly, though, was that perpetrated by Bhaal, god of murder, who foresaw his own death during the Time of Troubles. While in mortal form, Bhaal conceived multitudes of offspring, plotting to have them resurrect him. They actively hunted and slew each other, with the survivors collecting ever more of Bhaal's godly essence.": "多年来，博德之门孕育了无数的邪恶计划和阴谋。不过，最卑鄙的也许是谋杀之神Bhaal所犯下的罪行，他在动乱时期预见到了自己的死亡。当Bhaal以凡人的形式存在时，他孕育了大量的后代，计划让他们复活自己。他们积极猎杀对方，而幸存者则收集更多巴尔的神性精华。",

	"While the Outer City might seem the most lawless, every district of Baldur's Gate has its own threats. In the Upper City, patriar families and government officials jostle to secure their positions. Many are not above using private agents to acquire blackmail material, sabotage public appearances, or even frame innocents to secure power. The victims of these plots, and officials who want a fair and honest legal system, must resort to hiring their own agents to unearth conspiracies, break out unfairly imprisoned citizens, and obtain evidence the Flaming Fist cannot.": "虽然外城似乎是最无法无天的，但博德之门的每个区都有自己的威胁。在上城，贵族家庭和政府官员为确保他们的地位而争夺。许多人不惜使用私人代理人来获取勒索材料，破坏公众场合，甚至陷害无辜者以确保权力。这些阴谋的受害者，以及希望有一个公平和诚实的法律制度的官员，必须雇用自己的代理人来揭发阴谋，救出被不公平监禁的公民，并获得火焰拳头无法获得的证据。",
	"The Upper City's political intrigues and the Outer City's violence spills over into the Lower City, the city's middle ground. Rampant crime, class grudges, foreign threats, and economic pressures leave many Baldurians feeling trapped within their own homes. Flaming Fist patrols react to threats with indiscriminate violence, doing little to make citizens feel safer. As a result, in recent years many citizens have started banding together in crews. These counter-gangs align along professional or neighborhood affiliations, doing their best to protect their territories. While this has given some of the city's people a way of feeling more in control of their lives, it's also increased the number of armed citizens on the streets. Whether the Lower City is actually safer after the formation of crews remains an open question.": "上城的政治阴谋和外城的暴力蔓延到下城，这个城市的中间地带。猖獗的犯罪、阶级怨恨、外来威胁和经济压力使许多鲍杜尔人感到被困在自己的家里。火焰之拳的巡逻队对威胁的反应是不分青红皂白的暴力，几乎没有让市民感到安全的作用。因此，近年来，许多公民开始联合起来，组成团队。这些反帮派按照职业或邻里关系结盟，尽力保护他们的领土。虽然这给了城市的一些人一种感觉，使他们更容易控制自己的生活，但它也增加了街上武装公民的数量。组建小组后，下城是否真的更安全，仍然是一个有待解决的问题。",
	"In the Outer City, all the world washes against the city's gates. Here crime and poverty are contrasted by wonders from afar and the riches of cultures across Faerûn. The mix of wanderers and refugees remains in constant flux, with communities forming and disbanding on a monthly basis. None can possibly keep track of all the foreign traditions or the dangerous—sometimes outright evil—religious practices observed in the Outer City. As a result, Baldur's Gate has widely adopted a \"do no harm\" policy when it comes to faiths and organizations operating in the city. Any group is welcome to operate openly so long as the city's important citizens aren't harmed.": "在外城，所有的世界都冲向城市的大门。在这里，犯罪和贫穷与来自远方的奇迹和整个法鲁恩的文化财富形成鲜明对比。流浪者和难民的组合一直在不断变化，社区每月都在形成和解散。没有人能够跟踪所有的外国传统或危险的--有时是完全邪恶的--外城的宗教习俗。因此，当涉及到在城市中运作的信仰和组织时，博德之门广泛采取了 \"不伤害 \"政策。只要城市的重要公民不受伤害，任何团体都可以公开活动。",
	"Beyond all its dangers, Baldur's Gate is an adventurer's city, a place where a sword-for-hire can find a rich patron, join a secret guild, stalk killers for a bounty, or come to the aid of desperate citizens. Good-hearted champions fight against corruption and bring murderers to justice, while less moral mercenaries find a good price for their services. The city offers opportunities as well as the most reliable and ruthless market on the Sword Coast.

It also serves as a departure point for smuggling the region's treasures back the Sword Coast, as well as other ventures the Baldurians would prefer the native Chultans don't learn about. As a result, rarities from the depths of Chult, seen nowhere else on the Sword Coast, regularly trickle into the port and market stalls of Baldur's Gate.": "在尼安扎鲁港之外，博德之门在楚尔特保持着自己的势力范围。贝卢安堡是该城市、火焰之拳以及楚尔特的众多父系家族利益的滩头堡。这个小型的军事中心负责监督博德之门在楚尔特地区的大部分探索（和开发）。它也是将该地区的财宝走私回剑海岸的出发点，以及其他博德门不希望本地楚尔特人知道的冒险活动。因此，来自楚尔特深处的珍品，在剑海岸的任何地方都看不到，经常流入博德之门的港口和市场摊位。",
	"The sea routes between Baldur's Gate and Chult are far from safe. Pirates, Amnian privateers, and sea monsters are common in these waters.": "博德之门（Baldur's Gate）和楚尔特（Chult）之间的海上航线远非安全。海盗、阿姆尼亚私掠者和海怪在这些水域中很常见。",
	"Common belief holds that many parliament members, and possibly one or more of the dukes, can be bribed for their votes. Corrupt parliament members don't wish to be caught taking payments, usually not out of fear of legal reprisal, but of being perceived as incompetent among their peers. The perception is that one who can't be trusted to receive something as simple as a bribe likely can't be trusted to manipulate the city's intricate social web. Such leads to the common farce of officials buying cheap jewelry or fake art objects with their bribe money (usually in the form of platinum coins or jewels) hidden inside.": "人们普遍认为，许多议会成员，可能还有一位或多位公爵，都可以通过贿赂来获得选票。腐败的议员不希望被发现收受贿赂，通常不是因为害怕法律报复，而是害怕在同行中被认为是无能的。人们的看法是，一个不能被信任接受像贿赂这样简单的东西的人，很可能不能被信任去操纵这个城市复杂的社会网络。这就导致了常见的闹剧，即官员购买廉价的珠宝或假的艺术品，里面藏着他们的贿赂金（通常以铂金币或珠宝的形式）。",
	"Comprised of four dukes, the Council of Four presides over the government of Baldur's Gate. Though the Parliament of Peers and the patriars hold a great deal of power, the Council of Four is the ultimate authority. It convenes in High Hall, a fortress in the middle of the Upper City, and controls the Flaming Fist, the navy, the tax collectors, and all public utilities, among other things.": "四人议会由四位公爵组成，主持博德之门的政府。虽然贵族议会和元老们拥有很大的权力，但四人议会是最终的权威。它在上城中央的堡垒--高堂召开会议，控制着火焰之拳、海军、征税人和所有公共事业，以及其他事项。",
	"{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} is a fearless soldier who rose up through the ranks of the Flaming Fist to become its supreme marshal. Ravengard used his military position and influence to secure for himself a seat on the Council of Four. Following the deaths of two council members amid a cloud of corruption and scandal, he persuaded the Parliament of Peers to back his election to grand duke.": "{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}是一个无畏的士兵，他通过火焰之拳的等级上升到了最高元帅的位置。拉文加德利用他的军事地位和影响力，为自己争取到了四人议会的席位。在两名议会成员在腐败和丑闻的阴云中死亡后，他说服了议员议会支持他当选为大公爵。",
	"Upon ascending to the highest position in the city government, Ravengard refused to relinquish command of the Flaming Fist, making him the most powerful figure in the city by far. This decision has not endeared him to anyone, but Ravengard could care less about his popularity. His only concerns are the stability and prosperity of Baldur's Gate, and he doesn't trust any of the other dukes or anyone in the Parliament of Peers to put the city's interests before their own.": "在登上城市政府的最高职位后，拉文加德拒绝放弃对火焰之拳的指挥权，使他成为迄今为止城市中最有权势的人物。这个决定并没有让他得到任何人的青睐，但拉文加德可以不在乎他的人气。他唯一关心的是博德之门的稳定和繁荣，他不相信其他公爵或议会中的任何人会把城市的利益放在自己的利益之前。",
	"Ravengard rose to grand duke on a platform largely backed by idealistic commoners and enemies of the other established dukes. While he won election handily, Ravengard has struggled in performing his duties, finding his hands tied at every turn by both overt and invisible bureaucracy. Despite this, he's been a voice of reason and common sense on the Council of Four—if not the egalitarianism some hoped. He's also proven largely resistant to scandal and corruption, though many of his fellow dukes and those in the Parliament of Peers still regularly outmaneuver him politically. One of his only obvious pleasures remains the surprise inspections he regularly visits upon the troops at {@area Wyrm's Rock|3c4|x}.": "拉文加德在一个主要由理想主义的平民和其他既定公爵的敌人支持的平台上晋升为大公爵。虽然他顺利地赢得了选举，但拉文加德在履行职责时却很挣扎，发现他的双手处处被公开的和无形的官僚机构束缚。尽管如此，他在四人议会中一直是理性和常识的代言人--即使不是一些人希望的平等主义。他也被证明在很大程度上抵制了丑闻和腐败，尽管他的许多公爵伙伴和议员们仍然经常在政治上战胜他。他唯一明显的乐趣之一仍然是他定期对部队进行突击检查。",
	"Ravengard was recently tricked into attending a diplomatic summit in Elturel, unaware that his political enemies in Baldur's Gate orchestrated this meeting in a fiendish plot to remove him from power. In his absence, the Flaming Fist is leaderless, the council rudderless.": "拉文加德最近被骗去参加在艾尔图勒举行的外交峰会，他不知道他在博德之门的政敌精心策划了这次会议，是为了把他赶下台的邪恶计划。在他缺席的情况下，火焰之拳失去了领导，议会失去了方向。",
	"Once a vigorous and formidable politician, Duke Belynne Stelmane recently suffered a seizure that left her with a partially paralyzed face and slowed speech. In truth, a mind flayer provoked the duke's \"seizure\" when it took mental possession of her.

Not even Stelmane's aides are aware of her secret struggle, though they cover for her as best they can.": "贝琳-斯泰尔曼公爵曾经是一位精力充沛、令人敬畏的政治家，最近她的癫痫发作使她的脸部部分瘫痪，说话缓慢。事实上，当一个噬心者在精神上占有公爵的时候，激起了她的 \"发作\"。现在，斯泰尔曼对噬心者的影响发动了一场无声的战争，等待时机，直到她能找到一种方法来发出求援信号或恢复她的意志。甚至连斯泰尔曼的助手都不知道她的秘密斗争，尽管他们尽可能地掩护她。",
	"Given her current situation, Duke Stelmane is in no position to oppose attempts by her fellow dukes to seize the reins of power in Baldur's Gate.": "鉴于她目前的处境，斯特尔曼公爵没有资格反对她的公爵同伴们在博德之门夺取权力的企图。",
	"Duke Dillard Portyr was once a respected businessman, but after a string of sour deals, he pulled back from his investments. Now he uses his time to enjoy the comforts that his wealth and title provide him. He lives alone in his manor, having outlived his two wives and three sons, and trades correspondence with his niece, Liara Portyr, who commands a Flaming Fist outpost on Chult known as Fort Beluarian.": "迪拉德-波特尔公爵曾经是一位受人尊敬的商人，但在一连串不愉快的交易之后，他从投资中抽身。现在他利用他的时间享受他的财富和头衔给他带来的舒适感。他独自住在他的庄园里，已经超过了他的两个妻子和三个儿子，并与他的侄女利亚拉-波蒂尔进行通信往来，她在楚尔特指挥着一个被称为贝卢安堡的火焰拳前哨。",
	"Duke Portyr is conflict-averse and goes out of his way to avoid stress. He shows well in social situations, but is easily manipulated in the political arena. He is known for listening with concern, showing an earnest desire to help, making promises to look into things, and then doing nothing. As a result, a great deal of the citizenry's scorn lies heaped upon Duke Portyr's shoulders.": "波尔蒂尔公爵厌恶冲突，不遗余力地避免压力。他在社交场合表现良好，但在政治舞台上很容易被操纵。他以关心倾听而闻名，表现出真诚的帮助愿望，承诺调查事情，然后什么也不做。因此，市民们对波提尔公爵的蔑视很大程度上是堆在他的肩上。",
	"Duke Portyr expressed concern about Ravengard's diplomatic mission to Elturel, fearing what the Flaming Fist might do while Ravengard is away. If his worst fears come true and the Flaming Fist can't control itself, Duke Portyr plans to write a letter to his niece, urging her to return to Baldur's Gate and take command of the Flaming Fist in Ravengard's absence. It's literally the least he can do.": "波特尔公爵对拉文加德前往埃尔图勒的外交任务表示担忧，担心火焰之拳在拉文加德不在的时候会做出什么。如果他最担心的事情成真，火焰之拳无法控制自己，波特尔公爵计划给他的侄女写一封信，敦促她回到博德之门，在拉文加德不在时指挥火焰之拳。这简直是他能做的最起码的事。",
	"Acid-tongued, shrewd, and aggressive, {@creature Duke Thalamra Vanthampur|BGDIA} is the matriarch of the Vanthampur family. Born with nothing, she spent years wallowing in obscurity, repairing and renovating the city's ancient sewer system.

	"Years of political dealing, blame shuffling, and bribery paid off when Thalamra was elected to the Council of Four. Although she has served on the council for the shortest amount of time, Duke Vanthampur is easily the most politically savvy council member. She speaks little during meetings of the council, preferring to further her political agenda through meetings in her private offices and at her family estate.

On occasion, a vigilante or hired mercenary will break an accused commoner out of prison in order to ensure the accused's safety until the trial date.": "如果他们目睹了正在进行的犯罪行为，守望者和火焰之拳都有权利立即执行正义。在不明确的情况下，或者当涉及到有影响力的人时，被告会被监禁，直到可以确定审判。族长和其他有权势的人通常会被软禁，除非是在恶劣的情况下。普通人则在监狱中等待审判。有时，义务警员或雇佣的雇佣兵会将被指控的平民从监狱中救出，以确保被告在审判日期前的安全。",
	"Minor crimes, such as creating a public disturbance, petty theft, or vandalism carry commensurate punishments. Time in the stocks, public humiliation, or a fine are the usual judgments.

	"Many of the patriar families of Baldur's Gate can trace their lineage back for generations, but a significant portion of Baldurians were not born in the city. Most citizens began their lives in Tethyr, the North, the Western Heartlands, or other communities along the Sword Coast. Baldurians born in Amn, the High Forest, and nations bordering the Inner Sea are less common, but still present. Rarely, travelers from as far away as Chult, Mulhorand, or Luiren decide to follow the flow of trade and settle in the city.": "博德之门的许多元老级家族可以追溯到几代人的血统，但相当一部分博德人并不是出生在这座城市。大多数公民在泰特希尔、北方、西部中心地带或剑海岸的其他社区开始他们的生活。出生在阿姆、高级森林和与内海接壤的国家的鲍杜尔人不太常见，但仍然存在。很少有来自遥远的楚尔特、穆尔霍兰或卢伊伦的旅行者决定跟随贸易的流动而在城市定居。",
	"Baldur's Gate can be a rough place for ordinary folk. Among the twisting streets of the Lower City, commoners have significantly fewer rights than patriars, with only the brusque mercenaries of the Flaming Fist to keep them safe. Even worse off are the poor residents of the Outer City, many of whom aren't recognized as citizens. With the Flaming Fist too eager to punish criminal behavior by drubbing both accuser and accused, it's important that common folk have someone to watch their backs. That's why the people of Baldur's Gate created crews—collections of likeminded folk who band together for mutual protection. Depending on the crew, this protection can range from taking someone's side in a tavern brawl or guarding each other's shops to price fixing or inter-crew loans.": "对于普通人来说，博德之门可能是一个艰难的地方。在下城曲折的街道上，平民的权利明显少于爱国者，只有火焰之拳的粗暴的雇佣兵才能保护他们的安全。更糟糕的是外城的贫困居民，其中许多人不被承认为公民。由于火焰之拳急于惩罚犯罪行为，将指控者和被指控者都打倒在地，因此，普通人有一个人保护他们的安全是很重要的。这就是为什么博德之门的人们创建了团体--由志同道合的人组成的团体，他们在一起相互保护。根据不同的团队，这种保护的范围可以从在酒馆争吵中站在某人一边，或守卫对方的商店，到操纵价格或团队间的贷款。",
	"Crews were the first to institute the common practice of {@i burl}. Under this system, anyone seeking shelter and safety—usually those fleeing from the Flaming Fist or some other danger—can approach a house or shop and give three sharp knocks followed by a heavier one. The residents are then obligated to take that person in and hide them. This applies even to members of opposing crews, though anyone requesting sanctuary from a crew other than their own incurs a debt, both personally and on behalf of their crew. Abusing someone who's granted burl is grounds for immediate expulsion from one's crew, and such \"drowners\" are universally shunned.": "队员们是第一个实行{@i burl}这一普遍做法的人。根据这一制度，任何寻求庇护和安全的人--通常是那些逃离火焰之拳或其他危险的人--都可以走近房屋或商店，敲三下急促的敲门声，然后再敲重一点。然后，居民们就有义务接纳这个人，并把他们藏起来。这甚至适用于敌对团队的成员，尽管任何向自己团队以外的团队请求庇护的人都会产生债务，无论是个人还是代表其团队。虐待被授予burl的人是立即被驱逐出自己船员的理由，这样的 \"溺水者 \"被普遍回避。",
	"The dozens of crews calling Baldur's Gate home are as different in attitude and approach as the city's residents. For instance, everyone in the Lower City knows that if you need cheap muscle, you hire members of the burly Porters' Union or Stonemasons' Guild, and not even the Flaming Fist would willingly pick a fight with the blood-spattered Butchers' Block or the mercenaries and \"security consultants\" of the Bannerless Legion. Other crews, such as the Scribes and Sages or the Honorable Order of Moneylenders, would never dream of getting their hands dirty, while the Apothecary Alliance and Brethren of Barbers don't need to throw a punch to strike fear into rivals. From carpenters to grocers, the Forgeworkers' Lodge to the Wisewoman Weavers, nearly every profession offers some access to a crew. And not just legal professions, either; the Revelers' Union, made up of night-workers who sell drugs, companionship, and other recreations, is one of the most powerful in the city, thanks to the information it gathers from its clients.": "以博德之门为家的几十个团队在态度和方法上与城市的居民一样不同。例如，下城的每个人都知道，如果你需要廉价的肌肉，你会雇佣粗壮的搬运工联盟或石匠公会的成员，甚至连火焰之拳都不愿意与血迹斑斑的屠夫集团或无旗军团的雇佣兵和 \"安全顾问 \"打一架。其他团队，如文士和贤者或放债人荣誉团，做梦也不会想到会弄脏自己的手，而药师联盟和理发师兄弟会则不需要挥拳就能让对手感到恐惧。从木匠到杂货商，从锻工协会到女织工，几乎每一种职业都能提供一些接触船员的机会。也不仅仅是合法的职业；狂欢者联盟由出售毒品、陪伴和其他娱乐活动的夜班工人组成，是城市中最强大的组织之一，这要归功于它从客户那里收集的信息。",
	"Some crews are simply neighborhood-based, their association based on territory rather than trade, such as the Right Pashas of Little Calimshan, the Crossed of Wyrm's Crossing, the Gravemakers of Tumbledown, or the Bloomridge Dandies.": "有些团队只是以社区为基础，他们的联系是基于领地而非贸易，比如小卡林山的右帕夏人、巫师十字路口的十字人、翻滚镇的造墓人或布卢姆里奇的丹迪人。",
	"By far the most important crew to travelers, however, is the Gateguides. Made up primarily of teenage lantern bearers, the Gateguides earn a living hiring themselves out to newcomers to show them the ropes of the city, help make connections with other crews, and offer some degree of collective protection.": "然而，到目前为止，对旅行者来说，最重要的团队是Gateguides。Gateguides主要由十几岁的持灯人组成，他们以雇佣新人为生，向他们介绍城市的规则，帮助他们与其他团队建立联系，并提供某种程度的集体保护。",

	"While traders and visitors to Baldur's Gate are always welcome, spies and saboteurs are not. Legitimate foreign agents, such as ambassadors, are required to report to the High Hall for an elaborate series of interviews and licenses. Visitors technically should do the same, but the law is rarely mentioned at the city's gates and even more rarely enforced. What distinguishes a visitor and a foreign agent can be unclear, and if an individual doesn't have a license marking them as one or the other, any duke or peer can unilaterally change a non-citizen's status, effectively sentencing them to imprisonment or worse.": "虽然博德之门的商人和游客总是受到欢迎，但间谍和破坏者却不受欢迎。合法的外国代理人，如大使，需要向市政厅报告，接受一系列复杂的面试和许可。从技术上讲，游客也应该这样做，但法律在城市的大门口很少被提及，甚至更少被执行。访客和外国代理人的区别可能并不明确，如果一个人没有许可证，标志着他们是其中之一，任何公爵或同僚都可以单方面改变一个非公民的身份，有效地将他们判处监禁或更糟。",
	"Most travelers pay to stable oversize animals, either in Outer City liveries or at ranches outside the city. Some animals are simply surrendered at the gate, though, becoming property of the Watch (in the Upper City) or the Flaming Fist (in the Lower City), or sold during monthly auctions.": "大多数旅行者都会花钱在外城的牲口棚或城外的牧场饲养超大型动物。不过，有些动物只是在门口被交出，成为守望者（在上城）或火焰之拳（在下城）的财产，或者在每月的拍卖会上出售。",
	"Patriars are the elite upper class of the city, a rank defined largely by money and lines of vague, increasingly inconsequential heritage. Many nobles claim generations of lineage, dating to the earliest days of Baldur's Gate. Their money funds industries and lines political pockets, but their names allow them to wield influence throughout the city.": "族长是这个城市的上层精英，这个等级主要由金钱和模糊的、越来越不重要的遗产线来定义。许多贵族声称自己有几代人的血统，可以追溯到博德之门最早期的时代。他们的钱资助了工业和政治口袋，但他们的名字使他们能够在整个城市发挥影响力。",
	"Some patriars are economically-minded individuals who rise early and spend their days in meetings and negotiations. They fund expeditions into dangerous locales and hire explorers to map uncharted territories. Other patriars manipulate the city's power players through diplomacy and intrigue. They spend their days flitting from theater performances to private balls, while quietly making and breaking the alliances that underwrite the city's structures.": "一些爱国者是有经济头脑的人，他们起得很早，整天都在开会和谈判。他们资助探险队进入危险地区，并雇用探险家绘制未知的领土。其他爱国者则通过外交和阴谋来操纵城市的权力人物。他们整天从剧院演出到私人舞会中穿梭，同时悄悄地建立和破坏支撑城市结构的联盟。",
	"Patriars live and work in the Upper City. Their manor homes employ dozens of servants, along with contingents of personal guards. The wall surrounding the Upper City as well as the constant presence of the Watch—which exclusively patrols that district—goes far toward assuring their security. As a side effect, it also means many patriars go months without engaging with the city's common folk, their insulation leading to the spread of divisive rumors.": "族长们在上城生活和工作。他们的庄园雇佣了几十个仆人，还有几支私人卫队。围绕上城的围墙以及专门在该地区巡逻的守望者的持续存在，在很大程度上保证了他们的安全。作为一个副作用，这也意味着许多族长数月不与城市的普通民众接触，他们的隔绝导致了分裂性谣言的传播。",
	"Patriars know the danger of the other districts, where their wealth is a lure and their names carry no weight. Patriars who have to travel the Lower City always do so with guards, and still risk robbery or worse violence.": "族长们知道其他地区的危险，在那里他们的财富是一种诱惑，而他们的名字没有重量。不得不在下城旅行的护法者总是在警卫的陪同下进行旅行，而且仍然面临着被抢劫或更严重的暴力的风险。",
	"Many patriar families hire proxies to carry out their business in the Lower City or Outer City. If circumstances force patriars to visit the Outer City personally, they typically travel in disguise, paying adventurers or mercenaries to protect them without drawing the attention of a uniformed personal guard.": "许多爱国者家族雇佣代理人在下城或外城开展他们的业务。如果情况迫使元老们亲自去外城，他们通常会乔装出行，付钱给冒险者或雇佣兵来保护他们，而不会引起穿制服的私人卫队的注意。",
	"Among the common folk and criminal element of the city, patriars have a reputation for callousness. Common wisdom holds that patriars are out of touch with everyday life and value citizens' lives cheaply. For some nobles, this assessment holds true. These patriars are class-conscious dilettantes who spend their money on frivolous bets, debauched entertainment, and risky business ventures. For this callous lot, the common people are nothing more than fools to be bilked, clods undeserving of comfort and wealth due to their lack of comfort and breeding.": "在城市的普通民众和犯罪分子中，爱国者以冷酷无情著称。一般人认为，爱国者与日常生活脱节，对市民的生命看得很淡。对于一些贵族来说，这种评价是正确的。这些爱国者是有阶级意识的二流子，他们把钱花在轻浮的赌博、放荡的娱乐和冒险的商业投资上。对这些冷酷无情的人来说，老百姓不过是被骗的傻瓜，是不配享受舒适和财富的笨蛋，因为他们缺乏舒适和教养。",
	"For a few patriars, though, the inequality of Baldur's Gate is a serious concern. Blocked by a corrupt government and uncaring peers, these civic-minded nobles use unorthodox channels to distribute aid. They quietly fund vigilante action that protects the vulnerable groups. They stage robberies on their own property and secretly send the \"stolen goods\" to sick houses and charities. These patriars know that to act openly is to invite scorn from their peers, which may edge them out of alliances and deals that could strengthen their standing. Worse, it makes them targets for corrupt elite who prefer the city's divisions as they are.": "不过，对于少数爱国者来说，博德之门的不平等是一个严重的问题。在腐败的政府和无情的同僚的阻挠下，这些有公民意识的贵族使用非正统的渠道来分配援助。他们悄悄地资助保护弱势群体的民团行动。他们在自己的财产上制造抢劫案，并秘密地将 \"赃物 \"送到病院和慈善机构。这些爱国者知道，公开行动会招致同行的嘲笑，这可能会使他们脱离可以加强其地位的联盟和交易。更糟的是，这使他们成为腐败精英的目标，他们更喜欢城市的分裂状态。",
	"Some good-hearted but naïve patriars have been known to venture into the Lower City and even the Outer City to volunteer with the disadvantaged or share their wealth. Even in disguise, though, these nobles are usually quickly identified and become targets of the Guild or other criminals. More than one patriar on a mission of mercy has disappeared into the Lower City, never to be seen again.": "一些心地善良但天真烂漫的爱国者被称为冒险进入下城甚至外城，为弱势群体提供志愿服务或分享他们的财富。不过，即使是伪装，这些贵族通常很快就会被识别出来，成为公会或其他罪犯的目标。不止一个执行仁慈任务的爱国者消失在下城，再也没有人看到。",

	"{@b Whitburn} owns the slate quarry east of the city.": "{@b Whitburn}拥有城东的板岩采石场。",
	"With trade ways running north and south along the Sword Coast, a port on the Sea of Swords, and the Chionthar River leading inland, Baldur's Gate is perfectly situated for its role as a commercial hub. Craftspeople, merchants, traders, and smugglers all make a brisk living in the city, and many immigrants are drawn by the dream that anyone willing to work hard can be successful in Baldur's Gate.": "沿着剑海岸的南北贸易通道，剑海上的港口，以及通往内陆的奇昂塔尔河，博德之门的地理位置非常适合作为商业中心。工匠、商人、交易员和走私者都在这个城市里赚得盆满钵满，许多移民都被这样的梦想所吸引：任何愿意努力工作的人都能在博德之门获得成功。",
	"Baldur's Gate has plenty of exports, notably fish, fish glue, and sea salt, but its main economic force is trade itself. The city boasts multiple large and well-connected trade guilds and a marketplace where wholesalers can exchange goods before moving up or down the Sword Coast.": "博德之门有很多出口产品，特别是鱼、鱼胶和海盐，但其主要经济力量是贸易本身。这个城市拥有多个大型的、关系良好的贸易行会和一个市场，批发商可以在剑海岸的上下游进行货物交换。",
	"The number of ships in port and traders making their way north or south mean that Baldur's Gate boasts one of the most expansive markets in the west. Coin trumps morals in Baldur's Gate, with profit being the ultimate good. As a result, nearly anything can be bought and sold in the city's shops, whether it be rare jewels, magic weapons, secrets, alliances, or even murder. People visit the city seeking imports from Port Nyanzaru, verdigris-covered treasures dredged from the sea, blackmail information on political rivals, or custom-brewed poisons.": "港口的船只和南来北往的商人的数量意味着博德之门拥有西部最广阔的市场之一。在博德之门，钱财胜过道德，利润是最终的利益。因此，几乎任何东西都可以在城市的商店里买卖，无论是稀有珠宝、魔法武器、秘密、联盟，甚至是谋杀。人们来到这座城市，寻求从尼安萨鲁港进口的物品、从海里挖出的覆盖着绿泥的宝物、关于政治对手的敲诈信息，或者定制的毒药。",
	"Though the city has laws regarding the sale of stolen property, smuggling, and contract killing, such crimes are rarely reported and even more rarely enforced. Unless the complainant is a patriar or other powerful individual, law enforcement lacks the time and interest to pursue those engaging in mutually beneficial transactions. The unwritten law is do nothing that interferes with the city's economy and make your bargains in peace. Individuals who suffer due to morally questionable contracts must seek out private means of obtaining justice.": "虽然该市有关于出售赃物、走私和合同杀人的法律，但这些罪行很少被举报，甚至更少被执行。除非投诉人是族长或其他有权势的人，否则执法部门没有时间和兴趣去追究那些从事互利交易的人。不成文的法律是，不要做任何干扰城市经济的事情，在和平中进行交易。由于道德上有问题的合同而遭受损失的个人必须寻求私人途径来获得正义。",
	"Craftspeople and merchants organize in professional guilds and follow official charters. Unofficial guilds are technically illegal, but in the Outer City, such informal guilds are common.": "工匠和商人在专业的行会中组织起来，并遵循官方的章程。非官方的行会在技术上是非法的，但在外城，这种非正式的行会很常见。",
	"Most professional guilds operate in the Lower City, but prefer to provide their goods to the wealthy patriar families of the Upper City. Commoners grumble that they can't even buy from their own neighbors, with the choicest items and freshest food traveling up the hill. A laborer might toil all day at a fishmonger's shop, then be forced to take their pay to the Outer City and buy yesterday's catch from an unlicensed seller.": "大多数专业行会在下城经营，但更愿意向上城的富豪家族提供他们的货物。平民们抱怨说，他们甚至不能从自己的邻居那里买东西，最挑剔的物品和最新鲜的食物都在山上。一个工人可能会在鱼贩子的店里辛苦一整天，然后被迫带着他们的工资去外城，从一个没有执照的卖家那里购买昨天的鱼。",
	"In many cases, guilds intersect with crews. Such groups take an interest in their members beyond a professional level, working to assure that they're safe on the streets and at home so they can return to work the next morning. Those who mistreat a guild member might find themselves ostracized by all members of that profession, or even find themselves cornered by members of the guild's associated crew, their most menacing tools of the trade in hand.": "在许多情况下，行会与团队有交集。这类团体对其成员的关注超出了专业水平，他们努力确保他们在街上和家里的安全，以便他们第二天早上能够返回工作岗位。那些虐待公会成员的人可能会发现自己被该行业的所有成员所排斥，甚至发现自己被公会相关的团队成员逼得走投无路，手里拿着他们最可怕的交易工具。",
	"Baldurians are permitted to worship whatever deities they wish, so long as they refrain from violent acts and practices that disrupt trade. While multiple temples rise within the city walls, hundreds of tiny shrines sit along the twisted streets of the Outer City.": "鲍杜尔人被允许崇拜他们想要的任何神灵，只要他们不采取暴力行动和破坏贸易的做法。城墙内有多座神庙，外城曲折的街道上则有数百座小神庙。",
	"In the city proper, worship centers around a handful of well-known and generally respectable deities. Most established temples, with clergy and daily rituals, are in the Upper City, which precludes commoners from worshiping after dark, when only residents are allowed to remain in the Upper City. Since most commoners work during the day, their faith usually becomes secondary in their lives. Ostentatious adherence to religious rituals is seen as a privilege of the wealthy. Some Baldurians even think outwardly displaying one's faith is a sign of pretentiousness and insincerity.": "在城市中，崇拜的中心是少数几个著名的、普遍受人尊敬的神灵。大多数固定的寺庙，包括神职人员和日常仪式，都在上城，这使得平民在天黑后不能进行崇拜，因为只有居民才被允许留在上城。由于大多数平民在白天工作，他们的信仰通常成为他们生活中的次要内容。对宗教仪式的过分坚持被视为富人的特权。一些巴尔杜尔人甚至认为，向外展示自己的信仰是自命不凡和不真诚的表现。",
	"Among the many deities worshiped in Baldur's Gate, a handful hold particular prominence.": "在《博德之门》中所崇拜的众多神灵中，有几个神灵的地位特别突出。",
	"The High House of Wonders, located in the Upper City, serves as the city's temple of Gond, a god of innovation and invention. Within the walls of the temple, clergy members are permitted to brew experimental potions and elixirs, build and test mechanical constructs, and hire locals to participate in controlled experiments—all in the spirit of invention and innovation.": "奇迹之家位于上城，是城市中创新和发明之神冈德的庙宇。在神庙的墙内，神职人员被允许酿造实验性的药水和灵药，建造和测试机械构造，并雇用当地人参与受控实验--所有这些都是为了发明和创新的精神。",
	"High-ranking members of Gond's clergy oversee a number of secret projects sponsored by wealthy patriars or the Flaming Fist.": "冈德教士的高级成员监督着由富有的爱国者或火焰之拳赞助的一些秘密项目。",
	"In a city as dangerous as Baldur's Gate, prayers to the Vigilant One are many. Members of the Watch and the Flaming Fist, mercenaries, bodyguards, and the fearful pray for Helm's protection at his shrine, the Watchful Shield, located in the Upper City. Patriars who see themselves as protectors of the common folk pray to Helm for guidance as well.": "在博德之门这样一个危险的城市，向守望者祈祷的人很多。守夜人和火焰之拳的成员、雇佣兵、保镖以及害怕的人都在他的圣地--位于上城的守望之盾--祈求赫尔姆的保护。那些视自己为普通人的保护者的守护者们也向赫尔姆祈求指导。",
	"The Order of the Gauntlet, a good-aligned faction devoted to Helm, quietly sponsors vigilantes throughout Baldur's Gate. These self-styled \"protectors of the innocent\" leave Helm's holy symbol on the bodies of dead criminals, or carved into the flesh of live ones left at the Flaming Fist's doorstep.": "高塔骑士团是一个致力于赫尔姆的正统派别，在整个博德之门悄悄地赞助了一些义务兵。这些自诩为 \"无辜者的保护者 \"的人在死去的罪犯身上留下赫尔姆的神圣标志，或者将其刻在留在火焰之拳门口的活人的肉上。",
	"Ilmater's humble shrine stands in a quiet square in Heapside. The Shrine of Suffering provides free meals and a few coppers to the poor and destitute.": "伊尔马特的简陋祠堂矗立在海普赛德的一个安静的广场上。苦难祠堂为穷人和赤贫者提供免费膳食和几个铜板。",
	"Even in the Upper City, some citizens feel their existence is one of secret torment and suffering. The idea that pain has nobility to it—that there can be a divine reason behind the trials that face Baldurians—comforts many.": "即使在上城，一些市民也觉得他们的存在是一种秘密的折磨和痛苦。痛苦具有高尚性的想法--在巴尔杜尔人所面临的考验背后可能有一个神圣的理由--使许多人感到欣慰。",
	"Some patriars spread word of Ilmater's faith not out of devotion, but to control their lessers. If people believe their suffering is worthy, they are less likely to demand safer conditions, higher pay, or more rights. In recent memory, cryptic notes have appeared on the gates of patriar estates, warning that \"those who falsely champion the Crying God will find their own suffering multiplied.\"": "一些爱国者传播伊尔马特的信仰不是出于虔诚，而是为了控制他们的下属。如果人们相信他们的痛苦是值得的，他们就不太可能要求更安全的条件、更高的工资或更多的权利。在最近的记忆中，爱国者庄园的大门上出现了隐秘的字条，警告说 \"那些错误地拥护哭泣之神的人将会发现他们自己的痛苦成倍增加\"。",
	"An eye-catching, white marble pavilion in the Upper City known as the Unrolling Scroll serves as Oghma's shrine. Pilgrims on the road to Candlekeep often stop at the shrine to purchase or trade rare tomes. Adventurers looking for work sometimes linger nearby, waiting to hire on to missions intent on recovering lost books of magic.": "在上城有一个醒目的白色大理石亭子，被称为 \"展开的卷轴\"，是奥格玛的神殿。前往烛台镇的朝圣者经常在神殿前停留，购买或交易稀有书籍。寻找工作的冒险家们有时也会在附近徘徊，等待被雇佣去执行旨在找回丢失的魔法书的任务。",
	"Siamorphe, goddess of nobility and divine right, is not widely worshiped in Baldur's Gate, but her image looks out from the alcoves of weathered noble estates and from behind vines within patriar gardens.": "Siamorphe，贵族和神权的女神，在《博德之门》中没有受到广泛的崇拜，但她的形象从风化的贵族庄园的凹槽中以及从家长花园的藤蔓后面向外看。",
	"Long ago, many nobles of Baldur's Gate worshiped Siamorphe. Legend tells that her temple was a wonder to behold, its nave decorated with crests of the most powerful ruling families of the time. A secret vault contained signet rings, family trees, and copies of important decrees, holding them in case of some calamity.": "很久以前，博德之门的许多贵族都崇拜西亚莫菲。传说中，她的神庙是一个奇迹，它的中殿装饰着当时最强大的统治家族的徽章。一个秘密的金库里装着徽章、家谱和重要法令的副本，在发生灾难的时候可以保存它们。",
	"During one of the city's early uprisings, the temple became a target for rioters and was burned to the ground. Where the temple stood has since been forgotten. However, rumors persist that the temple's vault is likely hidden beneath a patriar home or even a different temple. Urban treasure hunters, desperate politicians, and disenfranchised nobles still sift through the unreliable records of ages past to find it.": "在该市早期的一次起义中，该寺庙成为暴乱者的目标，并被烧成灰烬。寺庙的位置从此被遗忘。然而，一直有传言说，神庙的金库很可能藏在一个族长家的下面，甚至是另一座神庙。城市里的寻宝者、绝望的政客和被剥夺权利的贵族们仍然在筛选过去时代的不可靠记录，以寻找它。",
	"Adherents of the goddess of good fortune maintain her temple in the Upper City. Given the number of people in Baldur's Gate who rely on luck to make it through each day, her following thrives. Even cruel-hearted criminals turn to Tymora for luck, hoping the goddess recognizes their boldness and daring. Evildoers who work outside the Guild tip their hats to Lady Luck before going out on a job.": "幸运女神的追随者们在上城保留着她的寺庙。鉴于博德之门中依靠运气度过每一天的人很多，她的追随者很兴旺。即使是心狠手辣的罪犯也会向泰莫拉寻求好运，希望女神能认可他们的胆量和勇气。在行会外工作的恶棍们在外出工作前都会向幸运女神致敬。",
	"Citizens who must walk the Lower City at night, or who venture into the depths of the Outer City, usually whisper joint prayers to Tymora and Helm. They know that luck is almost as valuable as vigilance when it comes to staying alive in the city.": "必须在夜间行走在下城的市民，或者冒险进入外城深处的市民，通常会低声向泰莫拉和赫尔姆共同祈祷。他们知道，当涉及到在城市中生存时，运气几乎和警觉一样宝贵。",
	"Tymora's temple unofficially serves as a gathering place for adventurers seeking dangerous quests. Citizens with bizarre problems or in overwhelmingly perilous situations come to the temple in hopes of finding the perfect aid to help them.": "泰莫拉的神庙非官方地成为寻求危险任务的冒险者的聚集地。遇到怪异问题或处于极度危险境地的公民都会来到神庙，希望能找到帮助他们的完美援助。",
	"No city as reliant on the sea as Baldur's Gate could do without a temple to Umberlee. Fisherfolk pray to the Queen of the Depths for good waters to ply their trade, and sailors beg Umberlee's mercy before embarking on their voyages.": "像Baldur's Gate这样依赖海洋的城市都不能没有Umberlee神庙。渔民们向深海女王祈祷，希望有好的水域来从事他们的贸易，而水手们在开始航行前也会乞求Umberlee的怜悯。",
	"Smugglers, too, pay homage to Umberlee. A great deal of illegal trade passes through the harbor in small crafts on moonless nights, and smugglers—particularly of dangerous beasts and kidnapped souls—know to drop a few coins into the water as they pass into the harbor to appease Umberlee.": "走私者也向Umberlee表示敬意。大量的非法贸易在无月的夜晚由小船通过港口，而走私者--特别是危险的野兽和被绑架的灵魂--知道在他们进入港口时向水中投下几个硬币以安抚Umberlee。",
	"Umberlee's adherents work out of the Water Queen's House, a magnificent structure on the city docks. They provide blessings to sailors and identify relics dredged up from the deep. When Umberlee is offended by the removal of an item from the sea, she expresses her displeasure to the clergy by sending them omens, urging the priests to advise the finder to return the plundered item to the depths at once—or else.": "Umberlee的追随者在水女王的房子里工作，这是城市码头上的一个宏伟建筑。他们为水手们提供祝福，并识别从深海中挖出的遗物。当Umberlee对从海里挖出的物品感到不快时，她会通过向神职人员发送预兆来表达她的不满，敦促神职人员建议发现者立即将被掠夺的物品送回深海，否则的话。",
	"Crime is a powerful force in the city. Fearsome creatures hunt along cobbled streets, and the worship of evil deities continues to rise.": "犯罪是这个城市的一股强大力量。可怕的生物在鹅卵石铺成的街道上捕食，对邪恶神灵的崇拜继续上升。",
	"The organization known simply as the Guild unites cutpurses, loan sharks, killers, thugs, con artists, grave robbers, cat burglars, and every other type of criminal in the city. The Guild operates under the noses of the Watch and the Flaming Fist by adroitly keeping its illicit activities quiet.": "这个被称为 \"公会 \"的组织联合了裁缝、高利贷、杀手、暴徒、骗子、盗墓者、偷猫贼以及城市中其他各种类型的罪犯。该组织通过巧妙地保持其非法活动的安静，在守望先锋和火焰之拳的眼皮底下运作。",
	"Each city neighborhood falls under control of one or more kingpins, crime bosses who report to the head of the Guild. These kingpins style themselves as elite criminals, often adopting memorable nicknames and distinctively decadent dress. Scores of common criminals work beneath each kingpin, with the most competent and cutthroat members rising to favored status.": "每个城市街区都在一个或多个大亨的控制之下，这些大亨都是向公会首脑报告的犯罪头目。这些头目把自己打扮成精英罪犯，经常采用令人难忘的绰号和独特的颓废打扮。数十名普通罪犯在每个头目手下工作，其中最能干和最残忍的成员被提升到受宠的地位。",
	"Some kingpins keep strictly to the shadows, but others operate more openly. Particularly in the Outer City, citizens often know their local kingpin. A kingpin might receive requests for help from citizens, asking for loans or dealing with unauthorized crime, such as a thieving neighbor. A kingpin tracks these favors and debts, calling them in when it suits them—often with interest.": "一些大亨严格保持在阴影中，但其他大亨则更公开地运作。特别是在外城，市民往往知道他们当地的头目。枭雄可能会收到市民的帮助请求，要求贷款或处理未经授权的犯罪，如偷盗的邻居。枭雄会追踪这些恩惠和债务，在适合他们的时候叫他们过来，通常会有利息。",
	"Rivalries exist between kingpins, and their territorial borders shift constantly. As long as these internal feuds don't disrupt Guild business or draw the attention of the authorities, no one interferes. Recent rumors claim that an Outer City kingpin known as Straightstick is calling in all his favors to make a move on a Lower City turf. Crossing the wall is riskier than the average power play, and those in the know predict the coming conflict to be a bloody one.": "枭雄之间存在竞争，他们的领土边界不断变化。只要这些内部争斗不扰乱公会的业务或引起当局的注意，就没有人干涉。最近有传言称，一个被称为 \"直棍 \"的外城大亨正在召集他所有的人马，对下城的地盘采取行动。越过围墙的风险比一般的权力游戏更大，知情者预测即将发生的冲突将是一场血腥的冲突。",
	"Guild operations in the Outer City center on smuggling and gambling. Some violent crime and theft occur, but for the most part, Outer City residents are too poor to draw the attention of the Guild. Travelers and visitors do fall victim to pickpocketing, muggings, and assault, though. As the Flaming Fist rarely comes to the district, the Guild has long operated with impunity. In recent years, though, the interference of vigilantes and hired adventurers has been on the rise.": "行会在外城的活动以走私和赌博为中心。一些暴力犯罪和盗窃事件时有发生，但在大多数情况下，外城居民太穷了，无法引起公会的注意。不过，旅行者和游客确实会成为扒窃、抢劫和袭击的受害者。由于火焰之拳很少来到这个地区，公会长期以来一直不受惩罚地运作。不过，近年来，义警和雇佣的冒险家的干预一直在增加。",
	"The Lower City serves as the heart of the Guild's operations. The locals here have enough money to make burglary and protection schemes worthwhile, and the Flaming Fist is spread too thin to address every instance of petty crime. The Guild's operations widen to numerous commercial ventures, such as gambling dens, animal fights, races, and brawling tournaments. Their traffickers also maintain routes into other districts, and guide individuals and illicit trade through them for a fee. Those who oppose the Guild—typically by going to the Flaming Fist—invite retaliation upon themselves and their neighbors. This makes most folk afraid to report crimes and pressures their neighbors to keep quiet as well.": "下城是公会行动的中心。这里的当地人有足够的钱来进行入室盗窃和保护计划，而火焰之拳的力量太过分散，无法解决每一起轻微的犯罪事件。行会的业务范围扩大到许多商业企业，如赌馆、动物搏斗、比赛和斗殴锦标赛。他们的人贩子还维持着进入其他地区的路线，并引导个人和非法贸易通过这些路线，以获取费用。那些反对公会的人--通常是去找火焰之拳的人--会招致对自己和邻居的报复。这使得大多数人不敢举报犯罪，并迫使他们的邻居也保持沉默。",
	"In the Upper City, the Guild engages in burglary, extortion, blackmail, and confidence games. Patriars might even hire Guild members to gain (or plant) information about their rivals, involving the Guild in Upper City politics.": "在上城，行会从事盗窃、敲诈、勒索和信任游戏。族长们甚至可能雇佣公会成员来获得（或植入）关于他们对手的信息，让公会参与上城的政治。",
	"Only the most talented criminals dare to burgle patriar estates, but the lower ranks of a kingpin's operation often work as pickpockets or try to con residents of the district. Here, the Watch zealously monitors for Guild activities and targets anyone threatening the peace. Kingpins can often come to an agreement with the Watch, though, offering bribes so that Watch officers look the other way. Every month, the kingpin makes their payment to the Watch and selects a new safe word. Guild members caught by the Watch utter the safe word to avoid arrest. Rival kingpins and unaffiliated criminals looking to work in the Upper City pay well for the month's safe word, though any member of the Guild found selling the information faces harsh punishment.": "只有最有才华的罪犯才敢偷盗父老乡亲的庄园，但枭雄的下层人员往往会当扒手或试图欺骗该地区的居民。在这里，守望者热心地监督公会的活动，并针对任何威胁和平的人。不过，大亨们往往能与守夜人达成协议，提供贿赂，让守夜人的官员另眼相看。每个月，大亨们都会向守望先锋付款并选择一个新的安全词。被观察者抓住的行会成员说出安全词，以避免被捕。敌对的大亨和想在上城工作的无党派罪犯为当月的安全词支付高额报酬，但任何被发现出售信息的公会成员都会受到严厉的惩罚。",
	"The current leader of the Guild, {@creature Nine-Fingers Keene|BGDIA}, disdains flashy garb and illusion magic. She appears to the world as she is: an unassuming woman of middling age and build. Her forgettable looks have proven her greatest asset as a thief, as her victims have trouble recognizing her even when they meet her again face-to-face. Keene's leadership over the years earned her a reputation of thoughtful pragmatism. When necessary, she seeks revenge for offenses against the Guild—provided doing so is profitable. Her methods are vicious when necessary, and she is as feared as she is respected.": "公会的现任领导人，{@creature Nine-Fingers Keene|BGDIA}，不屑于华丽的服装和幻觉魔法。她以自己的身份出现在世人面前：一个年龄和身材都中等的不起眼的女人。她那令人难忘的外表已经证明了她作为一个小偷的最大优势，因为她的受害者即使在面对面地再次见到她时也很难认出她来。基恩多年来的领导力为她赢得了深思熟虑的实用主义的声誉。必要时，她会为对公会的冒犯寻求报复--只要这样做是有利可图的。必要时，她的方法很恶毒，她既让人害怕，也让人尊敬。",
	"Keene has become increasingly intolerant of the populous tide turning against her organization. While the occasional rabble-rouser has always impeded criminal business, the rise of organized crews and vigilantes is interfering with Guild operations. After a carefully coordinated attack on a patriar's estate fell to pieces when a vigilante clumsily alerted the estate guards, Keene declared open season on do-gooders of all stripes.": "基恩已经变得越来越不能容忍民众对她的组织的反感。虽然偶尔的乌合之众总是阻碍了犯罪活动，但有组织的团伙和义警的兴起正在干扰公会的运作。在一次精心协调的对一个元老庄园的袭击中，一个义务警员笨拙地惊动了庄园的守卫，从而使该庄园化为乌有，基恩宣布对各种类型的行善者开放季节。",
	"The plots of patriars and the schemes of Guild operatives fill the gossip and whispers of Baldur's Gate. Yet, throughout the city, no names are as synonymous with dastardly acts as those of Dead Three. The demigods Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul walk among mortals, personally seeking followers to their cause. More than once, it's rumored, the trio has even trod the streets of Baldur's Gate.": "在博德之门的流言蜚语中，充斥着爱国者的阴谋和公会成员的计划。然而，在整个城市中，没有哪个名字能像死亡三人组那样成为卑鄙行为的同义词。半神贝恩（Bane）、巴哈（Bhaal）和米尔库（Myrkul）在凡人中行走，亲自为他们的事业寻找追随者。不止一次，有传言说，这三个人甚至在博德之门的街道上行走。",
	"Nefarious patriars whisper prayers to Bane when they seek to gain power through coercion, intimidation, and forceful exaction of the law. Gang leaders, evil mercenaries, and others who rely on fear and control, also pay homage to Bane. Those who want to evoke dominance and ruthlessness favor wearing black gloves—a nod to Bane's holy symbol.": "当邪恶的爱国者试图通过胁迫、恐吓和强行征用法律来获得权力时，他们会向贝恩低声祈祷。黑帮头目、邪恶的雇佣兵以及其他依靠恐惧和控制的人也会向贝恩致敬。那些想唤起统治力和无情的人喜欢戴上黑色手套--这是对贝恩的神圣象征的点头。",
	"Myrkul claims a following among those who wish to learn from or command the dead. Those who plunder tombs for lost knowledge, grim entrepreneurs who see business sense in undead servants, even pragmatic necromancers seeking to conjure secrets from the wealthy dead of Cliffside Cemetery all whisper prayers to Myrkul. Of the Dead Three, Myrkul's base of power is the smallest. Residents of Baldur's Gate rarely fear death by old age—a grim fact of living in such a dangerous city. As a result, few desperate elders seek the blessing of the Lord of Bones. Those who do, though, tend to be both cagey and wealthy, which means that although Myrkul's worshipers are small in number, their resources have hidden depths.": "米尔库在那些希望向死人学习或指挥死人的人中拥有一批粉丝。那些掠夺陵墓以寻找失落的知识的人，那些从不死的仆人身上看到商业意义的严峻的企业家，甚至是务实的死灵法师，想要从悬崖边公墓的富有的死人身上变出秘密，都对米库尔低声祈祷。在死亡三人组中，米尔库尔的权力基础是最小的。博德之门的居民很少害怕年老时的死亡--这是生活在这样一个危险城市中的严峻事实。因此，很少有绝望的长者寻求骨头之王的祝福。不过，那些寻求祝福的人往往既狡猾又富有，这意味着虽然米尔库尔的崇拜者人数不多，但他们的资源却很有深度。",
	"Since the time when the Bhaalspawn Sarevok plotted to start a war between Baldur's Gate and Amn as a path to claiming Bhaal's power, awareness of the Lord of Murder's children has grown. Baldur's Gate maintains a grim draw for Bhaalspawn, whether due to some foul influence in the city itself, or merely because of Sarevok's lingering reputation.": "自从Bhaalspawn Sarevok密谋在Baldur's Gate和Amn之间发动战争，作为夺取Bhaal权力的途径以来，人们对谋杀之主的孩子们的认识就越来越深。博德之门对Bhaalspawn保持着严峻的吸引力，不管是由于城市本身的一些肮脏的影响，还是仅仅由于Sarevok挥之不去的名声。",
	"At the same time, worship of Bhaal proves darkly popular in Baldur's Gate. Few openly admit to worshiping the Lord of Murder, but there is an unspoken assumption that anyone who benefits from violent death has some respect for Bhaal. Assassination and murder underpin many of the plots in the city, from the business of highly-paid killers on patriar payrolls to slayings of opportunity committed by Outer City fanatics. Such bloodthirsty faithful rarely gather in numbers, but they typically mark themselves by carving a fresh gouge on their thumbs—spilling their blood in Bhaal's name while creating a subtle mark identifying that identifies them among allies. Despite the Lord of Murder's decentralized worship, some believe a temple to Bhaal exists near or under the city, possibly in an ancient chamber beneath the sewers or carved into Dusthawk Hill. Rumor holds that eleven red crystals on the wall of the temple grow brighter with every murder committed, gathering power for either Bhaal or one of his future chosen. Some claim that Bhaal himself regularly visits the temple, his presence contributing to the city's high murder rate.": "同时，在《博德之门》中，对Bhaal的崇拜被证明是黑暗的流行。很少有人公开承认自己崇拜杀人之王，但有一个不言而喻的假设，即任何从暴力死亡中获益的人都对Bhaal有一些敬意。暗杀和谋杀是城市中许多阴谋的基础，从高薪杀手的生意到外城狂热者的杀戮机会。这种嗜血的信徒很少聚集在一起，但他们通常会在自己的拇指上刻上一个新的刻痕--以巴尔的名义洒下鲜血，同时创造一个微妙的标记，在盟友中识别他们。尽管谋杀之主的崇拜是分散的，但有些人相信在城市附近或地下有一座Bhaal的神庙，可能在下水道下面的一个古老的房间里，或者刻在Dusthawk山上。有传言说，每发生一起谋杀案，神庙墙上的11块红色水晶就会变得更亮，为巴尔或他未来选中的人收集力量。有些人声称，巴哈尔本人会定期访问这座寺庙，他的存在导致了这座城市的高谋杀率。",
	"While the Dead Three occupy a prominent place in Baldurians' fears, their faiths currently have only the shallowest roots in the city. Followers of the Dead Three have done more to incite dread than faith. As a result, their numbers remain relatively small. Their sinister reputations outstrip their actual influence, though, with gossip spreading quickly whenever the deities' ominous symbols appear in graffiti or the Flaming Fist cracks down on overzealous fanatics. Despite public fears and resistance from law enforcement, the cults of the Dead Three persist, causing many to darkly wonder why the servants of Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul hold such interest in Baldur's Gate.": "虽然 \"死亡三人组 \"在Baldurians的恐惧中占据了重要位置，但他们的信仰目前在这个城市只有最浅的根基。死亡三人组的追随者在煽动恐惧方面做得更多，而不是信仰。因此，他们的人数仍然相对较少。不过，他们险恶的名声超过了他们的实际影响力，每当神灵的不祥符号出现在涂鸦中，或者火焰之拳对过度狂热的狂热者进行打击时，流言蜚语就会迅速传播。尽管有公众的恐惧和执法部门的抵制，\"死亡三人组 \"的邪教仍然存在，这让很多人暗自纳闷，为什么班恩、巴哈和米尔库尔的仆人对博德之门如此感兴趣。",
	"All Guild operations are overseen by kingpins, a handful of which are described below.": "所有公会的运作都由王牌监督，下面介绍其中的少数几个。",
	"Most are surprised to find Goblin Behnie looks nothing like his name or monstrous reputation suggest, the Bloomridge kingpin being a tall, polished-looking gentleman in his early thirties. The name comes from his ferocious ego, wild rages, and a propensity for biting off the fingers of those who disappoint him. Behind his viciousness, though, Goblin Behnie has a keen eye, making him and his forgers the city's best source of illicit Watch tokens (for passage into the Upper City), visitor licenses, and docking permits.": "大多数人惊讶地发现，哥布林-贝尼的长相与他的名字和畸形的名声完全不同，这位布卢姆里奇的头目是一位高大、彬彬有礼的绅士，三十出头。这个名字来自于他凶猛的自我，疯狂的愤怒，以及咬断那些让他失望的人的手指的倾向。不过，在他凶恶的背后，妖精贝尼有一双敏锐的眼睛，使他和他的伪造者成为本市非法观察令牌（用于进入上层城市）、访客许可证和停靠许可证的最佳来源。",
	"The kingpin of the Twin Songs Faithless runs one of the city's best smuggling operations, slipping goods into the city along the Chionthar River and over Dusthawk Hill. The seventy-year-old claims to have been attacked by the infamous (and doubtfully real) Ol' Cholms, a giant snapping turtle rumored to sleep at the bottom of Gray Harbor. To prove his story, Straightstick uses a splinted old ferry pole as a crutch. Recently, the kingpin has grown bitter about his position, believing he deserves a territory within Baldur's Gate proper. He's planning an attack on Brampton, the destination of much of his smuggling and the territory of his ex-wife, Diamond Urchin.": "双子星的头目无信仰者经营着本市最好的走私业务之一，沿着奇安塔尔河和翻越尘鹰山将货物运入本市。这位七十岁的老人声称曾被臭名昭著的老乔尔姆攻击过（而且怀疑是真的），据传是一只睡在灰港底部的巨大鳄龟。为了证明他的故事，Straightstick用一根带夹板的旧渡轮杆作为拐杖。最近，这个头目对自己的地位越来越不满，认为自己应该在博德之门内拥有一块领土。他正计划攻击布兰顿，这是他大部分走私活动的目的地，也是他前妻钻石乌尔奇的领地。",
	"Few know that the last true heir of the Raddle patriar family died several years ago. Despite this, \"Dowager Raddle\" continues to throw lavish social events at her estate, though she never personally attends. Instead, her supposed relative welcomes guests, engaging them with sharp wit, hard liquor, political gossip, and political opportunities of \"gray\" legality. No one seem to know their host's name, though—a faux pas none would ever admit. As a result, the Manorborn neighborhood's politically active Guild kingpin is known only as the Whiskey Lady.": "很少有人知道，拉德尔父系家族的最后一位真正的继承人几年前就去世了。尽管如此，\"拉德尔太后 \"仍然在她的庄园里举办奢华的社交活动，尽管她本人从未参加过。相反，她的所谓亲戚欢迎客人，用敏锐的智慧、烈酒、政治八卦和 \"灰色 \"合法性的政治机会吸引他们。不过，似乎没有人知道他们主人的名字--这是一个没有人愿意承认的假象。因此，Manorborn社区政治上活跃的公会头目只被称为威士忌女士。",
	"Blackmail and theft pay well, but murder is the preferred tool of the ambitious. Murder silences witnesses, disposes of enemies, and clears the path to power. Assassins never lack for work in Baldur's Gate.": "敲诈和偷窃的报酬很高，但谋杀是野心家们的首选工具。谋杀可以让目击者闭嘴，处置敌人，并为权力扫清道路。在《博德之门》中，刺客们从不缺乏工作。",
	"In the Outer City, murder is practically a way of life. With neither the Watch nor the Flaming Fist to look after residents, criminals run free in the sprawling district. Criminals use murder to keep order among their ranks and remove threats to their organization. So-called \"snuff streets\" hold the bodies of the dead, dumped by their murderers in piles along the lane. The most desperate of Outer City residents prowl the snuff streets, hoping to find a missed copper piece or a salvageable boot to pawn. They strip the teeth from bodies, cut off hair that might fetch a coin, and sometimes—it is rumored—slice flesh from the corpses to stave off starvation. Recent reports of ghoul activity in the Outer City likely have their origins in these snuff streets.": "在外城，谋杀实际上是一种生活方式。由于没有守望者和火焰拳头照顾居民，犯罪分子在这个广阔的地区自由活动。罪犯们用谋杀来维持他们队伍的秩序，消除对他们组织的威胁。所谓的 \"鼻烟街 \"存放着死者的尸体，这些尸体被谋杀者堆积在小巷中。外城居民中最绝望的人在鼻烟街徘徊，希望能找到漏掉的铜片或可挽救的靴子来当掉。他们剥掉尸体上的牙齿，剪掉可能会得到一个硬币的头发，有时--据传闻--从尸体上切下肉来避免饥饿。最近关于外城食尸鬼活动的报告很可能是源于这些鼻烟壶街。",
	"In the Lower City, murder is less common but remains a threat. Long-time residents know to travel in groups after dark. Those looking to earn a few coins sometimes linger outside of taverns, hiring out as escorts for drunken patrons. Revelers can stay as late as they wish and still get home safely, provided they hire someone trustworthy to guard their trip home.": "在下城，谋杀不太常见，但仍然是一种威胁。长期以来，居民们知道天黑后要结伴而行。那些想赚点钱的人有时会在酒馆外徘徊，为醉酒的顾客提供护送服务。狂欢者可以随心所欲地待到很晚，但仍然可以安全地回家，只要他们雇用值得信赖的人看守他们的回家之路。",
	"Most murders in the Lower City have reasons behind them. The merchant found with his throat cut and pockets emptied, the husband murdered so his wife can marry her young mistress, the tyrannical shop owner stabbed by a desperate underling—residents understand these crimes. What frightens people are the senseless murders. The man found ripped to pieces with his pockets still full of gold, the woman slaughtered so viciously that her grieving husband is sent to the asylum, the shop owner who suddenly strikes down his faithful clerk—these are the crimes that lead to panic and wild rumors.": "下城的大多数谋杀案背后都有原因。商人被割喉，口袋被掏空，丈夫被谋杀，以便他的妻子能娶她的年轻情妇，暴虐的店主被一个绝望的下人刺伤--居民们理解这些罪行。让人们感到恐惧的是那些毫无意义的谋杀案。被发现的男人被撕成碎片，而他的口袋里还装满了金子；女人被狠狠地屠杀，以至于她悲伤的丈夫被送进了精神病院；店主突然袭击了他忠实的店员--这些罪行导致了恐慌和疯狂的流言。",
	"Some commoners claim that something about the city itself sparks violence in its citizens. A popular theory is that the spirits of the vicious pirates that once sailed the harbors still influence the city. Another is that the spirit of the long-executed serial murderer Alhasval Drenz, the Whitkeep Whistler, still stalks the city, possessing innocents to continue her unmatched killing spree. This adventure posits a third possibility: that the presence of the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA} fuels the avarice and ambitions of evil-minded folk in Baldur's Gate. This magic item lies in a vault under Vanthampur Villa (see {@adventure chapter 1|BGDIA|1}) and has a pit fiend trapped inside it (see \"{@adventure Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA|12|Shield of the Hidden Lord}\"). Were the shield to be taken from the city, the murder rate might drop suddenly.": "一些平民声称，这个城市本身的某些东西在其公民中激发了暴力。一个流行的理论是，曾经在港口航行的恶毒海盗的灵魂仍然影响着这座城市。另一种说法是，长期被处决的连环杀人犯阿尔哈斯瓦尔-德伦兹（Alhasval Drenz）的灵魂仍然在这个城市游荡，附身于无辜者身上，继续她无与伦比的杀人狂欢。这次冒险提出了第三种可能性：{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}的存在助长了博德之门中心怀邪恶的人们的贪婪和野心。这个魔法物品位于范坦普尔别墅下的一个金库里（见{@adventure chapter 1|BGDIA|1}），里面有一个坑道恶魔被困（见\"{@adventure Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA|12|Shield of the Hidden Lord}\"）。如果这个盾牌被带离城市，谋杀率可能会突然下降。",
	"It's unclear whether the rise of Bhaal's faith in Baldur's Gate stems from the frequency of murders, or if the murders spring from the worship of Bhaal. The Flaming Fist suspects a group of Bhaal worshipers behind a spate of recent similar murders, the victims stabbed to death and their own blood dribbled like a crown around their heads. The Fist's investigations have not yet resulted in an arrest, but officers suspect the murderers to be commoners with seemingly unremarkable lives covering their true, bloodthirsty natures.": "目前还不清楚Baldur's Gate中Bhaal信仰的兴起是源于谋杀案的频繁发生，还是谋杀案源于对Bhaal的崇拜。火焰之拳怀疑最近发生的一连串类似的谋杀案背后有一群巴哈的崇拜者，受害者被刺死，他们自己的血像皇冠一样滴在头上。拳头公司的调查尚未导致逮捕，但官员们怀疑凶手是普通人，他们看似不起眼的生活掩盖了他们真正的、嗜血的本性。",
	"In the Upper City, murder brings results. Muggings and crimes of opportunity are rare here. The Watch keeps Upper City residents safe from criminals and riffraff. The biggest threat to patriars are other patriars.": "在上城，谋杀带来了结果。抢劫和机会犯罪在这里很少见。守望者使上城居民免受罪犯和暴徒的侵害。对爱国者的最大威胁是其他爱国者。",
	"Bribery and blackmail can secure votes or sway an allegiance temporarily, but murder permanently changes the makeup of the Parliament of Peers. Several elite assassins exclusively take on political targets. The Watch puts little effort into tracking down expert assassins, knowing that arresting one means possibly exposing a whole cadre of powerful patriars. The wrath that would fall on the Watch isn't worth putting one assassin in the cells.": "贿赂和勒索可以获得选票或暂时动摇一个人的忠诚，但谋杀则会永久地改变议会的组成。一些精英刺客专门对付政治目标。观察家们在追踪刺客专家方面投入的精力很少，因为他们知道逮捕一个人就意味着可能会暴露一整批有实力的爱国者。观察站的愤怒并不值得把一个刺客关进牢房。",
	"Today, Baldur's Gate is split into three districts: the wealthy Upper City on the hills above the docks, the bustling Lower City around the harbor, and the lawless Outer City (which includes all neighborhoods outside the city walls). Regardless of what district one might be visiting, certain features are impossible to ignore, like the wash of Gray Harbor, the shadows of Dusthawk Hill, or the gates that contribute to the city's name.": "今天，博德之门分为三个区：位于码头上方山上的富裕的上城，港口周围热闹的下城，以及无法无天的外城（包括城墙外的所有街区）。无论人们在哪个区参观，某些特征都是无法忽视的，比如灰港的水洗，尘鹰山的阴影，或者为城市命名的大门。",
	"Important landmarks are marked on the large map of the city ({@adventure map 6.2|BGDIA|9|Map 6.2: Baldur's Gate}), which shows the entirety of Baldur's Gate and its immediate surroundings.": "重要的地标都标在城市的大地图上（{@adventure map 6.2|BGDIA|9|Map 6.2: Baldur's Gate}），它显示了整个博德之门及其附近的环境。",
	"Nine gates separate the districts of Baldur's Gate, providing the only points of entry to pass from the Upper City to the Lower City, or from the walled city proper to the Outer City and the wider world beyond. Baldurians, particularly if they do not wish to reveal a crew or family affiliation to a potentially hostile audience, often describe themselves by the nearest gate to their homes. Terms like \"Gondgater\" and \"Dragongater\" are widely understood as neighborhood identities, and are also understood as a way of eliding more troublesome connections.": "九道门将博德之门的各区分开，提供了从上城到下城，或从城墙内到外城以及更广阔的世界的唯一入口。鲍杜尔人，特别是如果他们不希望向潜在的敌对观众透露船员或家庭关系，往往用离他们家最近的门来描述自己。像 \"Gondgater \"和 \"Dragongater \"这样的术语被广泛理解为邻里身份，同时也被理解为一种逃避更多麻烦关系的方式。",
	"The Watch guards gates leading to the Upper City, while the Flaming Fist oversees the rest. Guards assigned to Baldur's Gate and Black Dragon Gate stay at sharp attention and seldom accept bribes. Those assigned to the smaller and more secluded gates, however, can be less attentive, particularly when distracted by jingling coins.": "守望者守卫着通往上城的大门，而火焰之拳则负责监督其他地方。被派往博德门和黑龙门的守卫保持高度警惕，很少接受贿赂。然而，那些被分配到较小和较隐蔽的大门的卫兵可能会不太注意，特别是在被叮叮当当的硬币所吸引时。",
	"Anyone entering the city must pay a nominal entry toll of 5 cp. While this is a small sum, it ensures that the truly destitute remain outside, consigned to the slums of the Outer City. Beggars and refugees crowd at the fringes of these slums, typically around Black Dragon Gate and Basilisk Gate, pleading for money to pay the toll and hoping that the guards won't drive them off for annoying more prosperous travelers.": "任何进入城市的人都必须支付名义上的入城费，即5cp。虽然这是一个小数目，但它确保了真正的穷人留在外面，被送到外城的贫民窟。乞丐和难民挤在这些贫民窟的边缘，通常是在黑龙门和玄武门附近，恳求有钱支付过路费，并希望守卫不会因为他们惹恼了更富裕的旅行者而把他们赶走。",
	"When the city is not under lockdown, merchants pour through the external gates from morning till night, while peddlers, delivery carriers, and servants move in equally swift streams through the inner gates. Toll collectors work quickly but methodically to inspect incoming and outgoing trade goods, ensuring that commerce flows smoothly and the city gets its share at every turn.": "当城市没有被封锁时，商人们从早到晚涌入外部大门，而小贩、送货员和仆人也同样迅速地通过内部大门。收费员快速而有条不紊地工作，检查进出的贸易货物，确保商业流通顺畅，城市每次都能得到它的份额。",
	"The city gates are closed at night. At dusk, the Watch evicts anyone from the Upper City who is not a patriar, bearing a patriar's livery or permission letter, or carrying a Watch-issued token. The enforcement of this rule is one of the means by which the Upper City reinforces its snobbery over the other districts. More than one Lower City merchant visiting an Upper City restaurant or theater near sundown has been embarrassed by a Watch member's loud, public caution that the gates are about to close. While being seen hurrying toward the gates is an obvious embarrassment, being caught and escorted out would be far more bruising—both to one's ego and body.": "城门在夜间关闭。黄昏时分，守望者会将任何不是族长、持有族长制服或许可信、或携带守望者颁发的令牌的人驱逐出上城。这一规则的执行是上城加强对其他地区的势利的手段之一。不止一个下城的商人在日落时分去上城的餐馆或剧院，被一个守夜人大声警告说大门即将关闭而感到尴尬。虽然被人看到匆匆忙忙地走向大门是一种明显的尴尬，但被抓到并被护送出去，对一个人的自我和身体都会造成更大的伤害。",
	"The nightly closing of the gates ostensibly keeps the patriars safe. Closing off the Upper City pushes street crime into poorer neighborhoods, or out of the city altogether. In the Upper City, patriars can walk down alleys with relatively little fear, but beyond its well-lit streets and tightly watched gates, the other districts become much more dangerous after dark.": "每晚关闭城门，表面上是为了保证爱国者的安全。关闭上城，将街头犯罪推向了更贫穷的社区，或者完全离开了城市。在上城，元老们可以走在小巷里，相对来说没有什么恐惧，但除了光线充足的街道和严密监视的大门，其他地区在入夜后变得更加危险。",
	"One of the largest and deepest harbors on Faerûn's western coast, Gray Harbor is also one of the busiest. The city's independence and general laissez-faire attitude toward the types of goods and people flowing through its port—so long as the government gets its cut—means that the harbor throngs with both honest captains conducting forthright trade and pirate crews looking to fence their wares. Plenty of sailors also make their homes nearby in the Lower City.": "灰港是法鲁恩西海岸最大、最深的港口之一，也是最繁忙的港口之一。这个城市的独立性和对货物和人员流动的普遍放任态度--只要政府能得到它的分成--意味着港口里有诚实的船长在进行坦率的贸易，也有海盗船员在寻求销赃。大量的水手也在附近的下城安家。",
	"The port itself is a tangle of piers, floating docks, and anchorages, from the massive Freighter's Finger pier catering to the heaviest barges to the more ordinary slips at Northtree or Commonsdock. Not actually attached to shore, the chaotic Flotilla is the city's cheapest long-term moorage option, where boats are welcome to raft together around common anchor buoys, and where some houseboats haven't moved in generations. A special division of the Flaming Fist called the Gray Wavers patrols the harbor, yet it's no secret that the more expensive docks are safer than the budget options. Sailors and even whole ships have been known to go missing in Gray Harbor, and while some assume such disappearances are the result of local shore-based pirates, others speak of Ol' Cholms, a mysterious sea beast capable of dragging ships down to the river's lightless bottom.": "港口本身是由码头、浮动码头和锚地组成的，从迎合最重的驳船的巨大的Freater's Finger码头到Northtree或Commonsdock的更普通的泊位。混乱的船队实际上并不连接到岸边，是该市最便宜的长期停泊选择，这里欢迎船只在共同的锚泊浮标周围一起漂流，有些房子的船已经几代人没有移动过了。火焰之拳的一个特殊部门叫灰衣人，在港口巡逻，然而，更昂贵的码头比预算选项更安全，这不是什么秘密。水手甚至整艘船都曾在灰港失踪过，虽然有些人认为这种失踪是当地岸上的海盗所为，但也有人说是老乔姆斯，一种能够把船拖到河底的神秘海兽。",
	"East of the city, high above the scattered slums and cut-rate inns that stretch along the trade road, rises the steep yellow granite of Dusthawk Hill. This cliff-skirted hill is one of the last known refuges of the Chionthar dusthawk (use the {@creature hawk} statistics), a once-common raptor whose numbers precipitously declined over the last century as regional turmoil and the ever-spreading slums outside Baldur's Gate consumed its habitat.": "在城市的东部，在沿贸易道路延伸的零星贫民窟和廉价旅馆的高处，耸立着尘鹰山的陡峭黄色花岗岩。这座被悬崖环绕的山丘是奇安特尘鹰（使用{@creature hawk}统计）最后的已知庇护所之一，这种曾经很常见的猛禽在上个世纪由于地区动荡和博德之门外不断蔓延的贫民窟消耗了它的栖息地，数量急剧下降。",
	"Local legend holds that the dusthawk was Balduran's favorite hunting bird, and that the Chionthar population is descended from his own personal hunting hawks. When the dukes of Baldur's Gate realized that the dusthawk was on the verge of extinction, they declared the hill, which included both the hawks' cliffside nests and their hunting grounds, to be off limits to unlicensed hunters. Despite the fences and cliffs that cordon off most of the hill, trespassers remain common, the demand for dusthawk hunting birds having exploded among the wealthy.": "当地传说尘鹰是Balduran最喜欢的猎物，Chionthar的人口是他个人的猎鹰的后代。当Baldur's Gate的公爵们意识到尘鹰已经濒临灭绝时，他们宣布这座包括鹰的崖边巢穴和猎场在内的山丘禁止无证猎人进入。尽管有栅栏和悬崖封锁了大部分的山头，但闯入者仍然很常见，因为富人对尘鹰猎物的需求已经爆炸。",
	"Many in the Outer City resent the hill being turned into private land. Several camps and slums were cleared as a result, their dwellers losing everything. The homeless resent the patriars for being willing to spend money giving hawks a home, but not them. Others resent the Flaming Fist guards who keep them from trapping on the hill. Stringy rabbits and scrawny quail made poor meals, but they were meals, and now many hunters have none.": "外城的许多人对山丘被变成私人土地感到不满。一些营地和贫民窟因此被清除，他们的居住者失去了一切。无家可归者怨恨爱国者愿意花钱给老鹰一个家，而不是他们。其他人则怨恨那些不让他们在山上捕猎的火焰拳守卫。瘦弱的兔子和潦倒的鹌鹑是可怜的食物，但它们是食物，现在许多猎人没有了。",
	"Rumors hold that werewolves lair in the sea caves under Dusthawk Hill, pretending to be ordinary smugglers—or ordinary animals—while plotting against the city. Whenever a grisly murder captures Baldurians' imaginations, someone is always quick to claim that it must be one of the Dusthawk werewolves who did the deed.": "有传言说，狼人躲在尘鹰山下的海洞里，假装成普通的走私者或普通的动物，同时谋划着对付这座城市。每当一桩可怕的谋杀案吸引了Baldurians的想象力，总有人迅速声称这一定是尘鹰山狼人所为。",
	"The Upper City, home to the patriar aristocracy of Baldur's Gate, is a place of beauty and splendor, where magnificent public sculptures stand alongside historic manors, upscale theaters and boutiques, and tiny stone-walled gardens tucked among the streets like hidden jewels. Flowers bloom along the tree-lined streets, ushering away any stray miasma that escapes from the less fortunate quarters below. Silks and velvets, gold braid and mink, water-clear diamonds and luminous pearls: these are common sights in the Upper City, and hardly glimpsed elsewhere except as cheap imitations.": "上城是博德之门的贵族们的家，是一个美丽和辉煌的地方，在那里，宏伟的公共雕塑与历史悠久的庄园、高档剧院和精品店并列，小小的石墙花园像隐藏的珠宝一样藏在街道之间。沿着绿树成荫的街道，鲜花盛开，把从下面不那么幸运的街区逃出来的任何杂散的瘴气赶走。丝绸和天鹅绒，金辫子和貂皮，透明的钻石和发光的珍珠：这些都是上城常见的景象，除了廉价的仿制品，其他地方几乎看不到。",
	"Everything in the Upper City speaks of privilege and wealth. Magical lights illuminate the clean-swept streets, some bearing enchantments that hold back the river fog. Most of the city's major temples are located in this district, flagrant evidence of how the faiths value the city's wealthy elite over congregants with shallower pockets. The finest wine shops, ateliers, and jewelers are all in the Upper City, where the Watch's nightly ritual of expelling all non-residents reinforces their air of luxurious exclusivity. Those without either Watch-issued tokens or a patriars' vouchsafe must leave at nightfall, without exception.": "上城的一切都代表着特权和财富。神奇的灯光照亮了干净整洁的街道，有些灯光带有魔法，可以挡住河水的雾气。这个城市的大多数主要寺庙都位于这个区，这公然证明了信仰是如何重视城市的富裕精英而不是口袋浅薄的教徒的。最好的葡萄酒商店、工作室和珠宝商都在上城，守夜人每晚驱逐所有非居民的仪式加强了他们的豪华排他性。那些没有守夜人发行的令牌或元老担保的人必须在夜幕降临时离开，没有例外。",
	"Residents of the Upper City feel great pressure to maintain outward appearances, and will keep their estate's facade finely maintained even at the cost of pawning everything within. Admitting to poverty in this district is admitting to shameful failure.": "上城的居民在保持外在形象方面感受到了巨大的压力，他们会保持他们的庄园的外观精美，甚至不惜典当内部的一切。在这个地区承认贫穷就是承认可耻的失败。",
	"The patriars' unabashed snobbery fosters deep resentment among denizens of the Lower City and Outer City, who can see the good life enjoyed before their eyes but are excluded from all but the smallest tastes. The Watch is merciless about turning beggars and malcontents away from the gates, where an erratically enforced entry toll for non-residents and those without Watch tokens or escorts effectively bars the poor from setting foot within this district. A patriar caught outside the Upper City after dark, therefore, is at high risk of robbery, beating, or worse.": "爱国者们不加掩饰的势利眼在下城和外城的居民中激起了深深的怨恨，他们可以看到美好的生活就在眼前，但却被排除在所有最小的品味之外。守望者毫不留情地将乞丐和不满者拒之门外，对非居民和没有守望者令牌或护卫的人不定期地征收进入费，有效地阻止了穷人踏入这个地区。因此，天黑后在上城外被抓到的爱国者，很有可能遭到抢劫、殴打，甚至更糟。",

	"The Old Wall, built at Balduran's behest centuries ago, surrounds the Upper City. Six gates pierce it, channeling the district's visitors and commerce. Entering the Upper City requires either being a patriar, having a patriar's letter or livery, showing a Watch token issued to the Upper City's residents or licensed to its few inns for guest use, or paying an entry toll. Tokens and tolls are only accepted at Citadel Gate, Baldur's Gate, and the Black Dragon Gate, since the other gates are reserved for the exclusive use of patriars, their servants, and their guests.": "几个世纪前在巴尔杜兰的授意下建造的旧城墙环绕着上城。六道门穿透它，引导该地区的游客和商业。进入上城需要成为一名爱国者，拥有爱国者的信件或制服，出示发放给上城居民的守望令牌，或授权给少数旅馆供客人使用，或支付进入费。只有城堡门、博德门和黑龙门才接受令牌和通行费，因为其他大门只保留给族长、他们的仆人和他们的客人使用。",
	"{@b Black Dragon Gate}. Named for the dragon's head that a victorious knight once hung upon its arch, the Black Dragon Gate faces the road heading north toward distant Waterdeep. The original dragon's head is long gone, but a stone replacement snarls above the gate's arch. Local legend claims that the stone head will magically spew acid at attackers if the city should ever fall under siege.": "{@b Black Dragon Gate}. 黑龙门因其拱门上曾经挂着一个胜利的骑士的龙首而得名，它面对着向北走向遥远的沃特迪普的道路。原来的龙头早已不复存在，但一个石制的替代物在大门的拱门上咆哮着。当地的传说称，如果城市被围困，这个石头会神奇地对攻击者喷出硫酸。",
	"{@b Citadel Gate}. The only entrance to the Watch's fortress, Citadel Gate nestles into the Upper City's landward wall. The Watch maintains a small cavalry, nominally for defense and crowd control, but primarily for parades, honor escorts, and other ceremonial functions. Because of this, the Citadel maintains the only stable within the city walls.": "{@b Citadel Gate}. 城堡门是通往守望先锋堡垒的唯一入口，依偎在上城的向陆墙内。守夜人保持着一支小规模的骑兵，名义上是为了防御和控制人群，但主要是为了游行、荣誉护送和其他仪式功能。正因为如此，城主府维持着城墙内唯一的马厩。",
	"{@b Patriar Gates}. The four gates known collectively as the patriar gates—Gond Gate, Heap Gate, Manor Gate, and Sea Gate—are smaller and are generally not accessible by the general public. They were built after the construction of the Lower City walls and were intended to offer patriars convenient access from their homes to their business concerns and back. Privately funded by the patriars, and thus serving as a display of their personal success, these gates are more ornate and tightly guarded than the public gates. Officially, none may use them without bearing a patriar's livery or letter of permission, although rumors persist that Guild kingpins and veteran servants among several patriar staffs know exactly which guards to bend. Regardless, the visible double standard imposed at these gates is a constant gall to Lower City residents forced to take longer routes through the public gates because they cannot use the ones in their own neighborhoods.": "{@b Patriar Gates}. 被统称为族长门的四个门--贡门、堆门、庄园门和海门--规模较小，一般公众无法进入。它们是在下城墙建成后建造的，目的是为族长们提供从他们的家到他们的生意所在地的便利通道。这些门是由元老们私人出资建造的，因此也是他们个人成功的展示，这些门比公共门更加华丽，而且戒备森严。官方规定，没有族长的制服或许可信，任何人都不能使用这些大门，尽管有传言说，行会的王公贵族和几个族长幕僚中的资深仆人知道哪些守卫可以屈服。不管怎么说，这些门上明显的双重标准对下城居民来说是一种持续的压力，因为他们不能使用自己社区的门而被迫走更长的路线通过公共门。",
	"While most outsiders see only rampant luxury among the Upper City's streets, the district's residents perceive a wide spectrum of style and status. Wealth and taste as much as location serve to divide the Upper City into a variety of distinct neighborhoods.": "虽然大多数外人只看到上城的街道上有猖獗的奢侈品，但该区的居民却看到了一个广泛的风格和地位。财富和品味以及地理位置将上城划分为各种不同的社区。",
	"{@b Citadel Streets}. The northern part of the Upper City is dominated by the Watch Citadel, where the Watch conducts training, maintains its barracks and stable, and keeps a few jail cells. Beyond the Citadel, this neighborhood includes many shops and the comparatively modest, though still grand, houses that belong to the few non-patriar residents of the Upper City.": "{@b Citadel Streets}. 上城的北部以守望堡为主，守望堡在这里进行训练，维持其军营和马厩，并保留一些牢房。在城堡之外，这一带包括许多商店和属于上城少数非宗主国居民的相对简陋的房屋，虽然仍然很宏伟。",
	"{@b Manorborn}. The most palatial residences lie on the Upper City's west side. Most of the Parliament of Peers live here, as do the old, proud families who trace their lineages back to Balduran's day. Climbing gardens, fountained courtyards, and private orchards adorn many of these elegant homes.": "{@b Manorborn}. 最富丽堂皇的住宅位于上城的西侧。大多数议会议员都住在这里，那些古老而骄傲的家族也住在这里，他们的血统可以追溯到巴尔杜兰时代。攀登花园、喷泉庭院和私人果园装饰着许多这些优雅的住宅。",
	"{@b Temples}. Grand cathedrals and shrines shape the skyline in this central neighborhood, with Gond's High House of Wonders foremost among them. Priests in ceremonial finery and congregants dressed for the public eye are a common sight in this part of the city. Humbler petitioners are rare, though some come doggedly day after day, paying the tolls for hope each time.": "{@b Temples}. 宏伟的大教堂和神殿塑造了这个中心区的天际线，其中最重要的是冈德的高级奇迹之家。在城市的这一地区，身着仪式盛装的牧师和为公众着想的教徒是常见的景象。谦卑的请愿者很少，尽管有些人日复一日地来，每次都要为希望付出代价。",
	"{@b The Wide}. The primary market and largest civic space in Baldur's Gate is the Wide, where sellers set up their stalls and put out their wares each day at dawn. Street music and noisy performances are forbidden, and every night the sellers who are not Upper City residents must pack up and leave. Bustling by day, the Wide is desolate at night, except on holidays and when hosting grand celebrations.": "{@b The Wide}. 博德之门的主要市场和最大的市民空间是宽阔的，每天黎明时分，卖家在这里摆好摊位，把他们的商品摆出来。街头音乐和嘈杂的表演是被禁止的，每天晚上，非上城居民的卖家必须收拾东西离开。白天熙熙攘攘，晚上却一片荒凉，除了节假日和举办盛大的庆祝活动。",
	"The original wall built during Balduran's day, which encloses the Upper City and separates it from the Lower City, occupies an outsize place in the city's history and imagination. As the original relic of the city's first borders—and, more importantly for daily life, the physical embodiment of the division between patriars and ordinary citizens—the Old Wall is a symbol for much that Baldurians both admire and resent about their city.": "在巴尔杜兰时代建造的原始城墙，将上城与下城隔离开来，在城市的历史和想象中占据了巨大的地位。作为城市最初边界的原始遗迹--更重要的是在日常生活中，它是爱国者和普通公民之间划分的实际体现--老墙是巴尔杜兰人对其城市既钦佩又反感的象征。",
	"Most of the Old Wall was rebuilt following revolts early in the city's history, then reinforced during every major period of tumult that troubled Baldur's Gate afterward. Each push for renewal saw a conflict between Gondan engineers advocating for new building techniques and materials, and patriars and preservationists striving to protect the original architecture. Meanwhile, smugglers and Guild agents bribed building crews, altered blueprints, and otherwise put their fingers in the plans at every turn to steer reinforcement efforts away from their own secret passageways or induce builders to make new ones.": "大部分旧城墙是在城市历史早期的叛乱后重建的，然后在此后困扰博德之门的每个重大动荡时期进行加固。在每一次的重建过程中，主张采用新的建筑技术和材料的贡丹工程师与努力保护原有建筑的爱国者和保护主义者之间都会发生冲突。同时，走私者和行会代理人贿赂建筑人员，修改蓝图，并以其他方式随时插手计划，以引导加固工作远离他们自己的秘密通道，或诱使建筑商制造新的通道。",
	"After centuries of such unreliable maintenance, the Old Wall stands proud and strong, but only outwardly so. In truth, the barrier is riddled with numerous secret holes through—or, more often, underneath—its stones. Knowledge of such secret passages' locations is jealously guarded, and the hidden ways are used only sparingly, for the risk of discovery is too great to use them routinely. Nevertheless, if the Old Wall were ever to be seriously tested, its defenders might find it far less impenetrable than it seems.": "经过几个世纪这样不可靠的维护，古墙傲然屹立，但只是外表上如此。事实上，这道屏障上有许多秘密的洞口，穿过--或者更多时候，在石头下面。对这些秘密通道的位置的了解受到了严格的保护，而这些隐秘的通道也只是偶尔使用，因为被发现的风险太大，不可能经常使用它们。然而，如果古墙受到严重考验，它的守卫者可能会发现它远没有看上去那么坚不可摧。",
	"Baldur's Gate has a couple interesting features not mentioned elsewhere in this gazetteer.": "博德之门》有几个有趣的特点，在这个地名录的其他地方没有提到。",
	"One of the reasons why pirates find Gray Harbor attractive is the thick fog that shrouds the river, the docks, and most of the Lower City. The persistent fog makes it easy to conduct illicit business or commit a murder without anyone catching sight of the \"interaction\" through a spyglass. The fog sometimes creeps into the Upper City as well, but here it's much too thin to veil crimes.": "海盗们发现灰港有吸引力的原因之一是笼罩着河流、码头和大部分下城的浓雾。持续的大雾使得进行非法交易或实施谋杀很容易，而没有人通过望远镜看到这种 \"互动\"。雾有时也会潜入上城，但这里的雾太稀薄了，无法掩盖犯罪。",
	"In Baldur's Gate, lit lanterns fitted with panes of green glass are hung outside of permanent establishments to indicate that they're open for business. On foggy nights, these lanterns cast the city's lively taverns, brothels, dance halls, and festhalls in eerie green light.": "在《博德之门》中，常设机构的外面都挂着装有绿色玻璃窗的灯笼，以表示它们正在开门营业。在有雾的夜晚，这些灯笼将城市中热闹的酒馆、妓院、舞厅和宴会厅投射在阴森的绿光中。",
	"The great houses of the patriars are the wellspring of their pride and the center of high society. A manor stands as proof that the family held anchor in Baldur's Gate when the Old Wall was raised, and that its line has remained prosperous and unbroken since. Even on the rare occasion that a patriar manor changes hands entirely, the new owner generally goes to great lengths to prove—or fabricate—some connection, however tenuous, to the previous holder's line.": "族长们的大房子是他们骄傲的源泉，也是上流社会的中心。一座庄园证明了当旧城墙升起时，该家族在博德之门的地位，以及它的血统在此后一直保持着繁荣和不间断。即使在极少数情况下，一个父系庄园完全易手，新主人通常也会不遗余力地证明--或者编造--与前任持有人的某些联系，无论多么脆弱。",
	"Most patriar manors are townhomes rather than free-standing mansions, for the Upper City has always been constrained by its walls, and even the wealthiest families are limited to narrow footprints. In general, patriar manors have only small courtyard gardens, and rely on vertical arrangements such as espaliered fruit trees, trellised roses and wisteria, and vines trained along the house's walls.": "大多数族长庄园都是联排别墅，而不是独立的豪宅，因为上城一直受到城墙的限制，即使是最富有的家庭也被限制在狭窄的范围内。一般来说，族长庄园只有小的庭院花园，并依靠垂直布置，如espaliered果树、棚架玫瑰和紫藤，以及沿着房子墙壁训练的藤蔓。",
	"Because of the manors' storied pasts and small spaces, most manors are crowded with heirlooms and treasures accumulated across generations. Occasionally, however, a manor's grand facade hides destitution. Estates are expensive to maintain, and dynasties are prone to decline. Although no patriar would ever openly admit to lacking money, quite a few are hunting marriages with wealthy outsiders who might bring an influx of capital and ambition to their moribund lines.": "由于庄园的传奇历史和狭小的空间，大多数庄园都挤满了世代积累的传家宝和珍品。然而，偶尔，一个庄园宏伟的外表下隐藏着穷困。庄园的维护费用很高，而王朝也容易衰落。虽然没有一个族长会公开承认自己缺钱，但相当多的族长正在寻求与富有的外来者联姻，这些外来者可能会给他们奄奄一息的家族带来资本和野心的涌入。",
	"Despite its well-policed streets and decorous homes, the Upper City harbors secrets both marvelous and scandalous. Some of its most notable locales are described below in alphabetical order. These locations are also marked on the map of Baldur's Gate ({@adventure map 6.2|BGDIA|9|Map 6.2: Baldur's Gate}).": "尽管上城的街道治安良好，房屋整洁，但它却隐藏着令人惊叹和丑闻的秘密。下面将按字母顺序介绍一些最著名的地点。这些地点在博德之门的地图上也有标记（{@adventure map 6.2|BGDIA|9|Map 6.2: Baldur's Gate}）。",
	"Situated in the Manorborn neighborhood, Bormul House is an elegant three-story townhouse of yellow granite and slate with cream-colored roses climbing its garden walls. Last spring, a distant uncle came for a holiday visit, bringing a large load of baggage. The house servants acted strangely during his visit, though the Bormuls attributed this to a bout of shellfish poisoning that afflicted many households that spring. Days later, the uncle departed, leaving some of his curios behind. The Bormuls, lacking space to store these unwanted things in the manor, moved them to the family crypt beneath the house. There they lie now, largely forgotten.": "坐落在曼诺伯恩社区的博穆尔之家是一座优雅的三层联排别墅，由黄色花岗岩和石板组成，奶油色的玫瑰花爬满了花园的墙壁。去年春天，一位远方的叔叔带着一大堆行李前来度假访问。在他来访期间，家里的仆人表现得很奇怪，不过博穆尔夫妇把这归咎于那年春天许多家庭都出现了贝类中毒的情况。几天后，这位叔叔离开了，留下了他的一些古玩。博穆尔家族由于没有空间在庄园里存放这些不需要的东西，就把它们搬到了房子下面的家族墓穴里。现在它们躺在那里，基本上被遗忘了。",
	"Not long after, shantytown residents in the Outer City began suffering brutal attacks by a silent murderer wearing an archaic, threadbare patriar's cloak. Many have glimpsed this pale killer, but no one has ever been able to confront or follow the murderer to his lair, for he seems to melt into the city's fog after each slaying.": "不久之后，外城的棚户区居民开始遭受一个沉默的杀人犯的残酷攻击，这个杀人犯穿着一件古老的、破旧的族长斗篷。许多人都瞥见了这个苍白的杀手，但从来没有人能够面对或跟踪这个杀手的巢穴，因为他在每次杀人后似乎都会融化在城市的雾气中。",
	"Tendai and Khennen Shore (chaotic good human {@creature Commoner||commoners}) are a married couple that runs a successful business importing dried meats, spices, authentic cookware, and traditional recipes from Port Nyanzaru, where the rest of Tendai's family lives. Their pre-mixed assortments of ajwain, coriander, ginger, various curries, and colored salts have done much to bring Chultan delicacies to patriar tables.": "Tendai和Khennen Shore（乱世佳人{@creature Commoner||commoners}）是一对夫妻，他们成功地经营着从尼安扎鲁港进口干肉、香料、正宗厨具和传统食谱的业务，Tendai的其他家人就住在那里。他们预先混合的各种阿胶、香菜、生姜、各种咖喱和彩色盐，为把苏丹的美味佳肴带到父老乡亲的餐桌上做了很多工作。",
	"Despite their success, the Shores' business is straight forward and unpretentious, attracting attention from business prospectors interested in buying the couple out and expanding the business. The Shores have no interest in selling, despite numerous offers from patriar families and anonymous buyers. As a result, in recent weeks Distant Shores has suffered vandalism and the owners have received threatening letters.": "尽管他们取得了成功，但肖尔夫妇的生意直截了当，朴实无华，吸引了有意收购他们夫妇并扩大生意的商业前景者的注意。尽管有许多来自爱国者家庭和匿名买家的报价，但Shores夫妇对出售没有兴趣。因此，最近几周，遥远的海岸遭受了破坏，业主也收到了威胁信。",
	"While Nysene's siblings—Dolandre, Rusorra, and Trenteller—view this behavior as embarrassing and unworthy of her station, they also don't care enough to stop her, since the victims are social inferiors whose welfare isn't worth interrupting their own revels. It's also likely that her siblings are in denial about the true extent of their sister's sadism. Some of the city's evil faiths have begun to take notice of Nysene's games, however, with Bane's faith seeing a talent worth cultivating in Eomane House.": "虽然Nysene的兄弟姐妹--Dolandre、Rusorra和Trenteller--认为这种行为令人尴尬，不配她的地位，但他们也不在乎阻止她，因为受害者是社会的下层人士，他们的福利不值得打断他们自己的狂欢。她的兄弟姐妹很可能也在否认他们姐姐的虐待狂的真实程度。然而，这个城市的一些邪恶的信仰已经开始注意到尼森的游戏，贝恩的信仰看到了在尤曼之家值得培养的人才。",
	"This large, stately building serves as a quasi-religious museum for the magnificent inventions wrought in Gond's name. Unlike the similarly named High House of Wonders, which serves as both temple and workshop housing working prototypes not yet ready for public view, the Hall of Wonders is meant to showcase Gond's perfected inspirations. It holds marvels ranging from lockboxes cleverly disguised as ordinary furniture to unparalleled wonders such as a steam-operated mechanical orchestra, a steam \"dragon\" powering a heavy engine for moving immense weights, and elaborate orreries and nautical tools. Small cards posted beneath each display indicate the purpose of these curious tools and credit the inventors and lands of origin, where known.": "这座庞大而庄严的建筑是一个准宗教博物馆，展示以冈德的名义进行的宏伟发明。与名字相似的奇迹之家（High House of Wonders）不同的是，奇迹大厅既是寺庙又是工场，里面存放着尚未准备好供公众参观的工作原型，而奇迹大厅则是为了展示刚德完善的灵感。它拥有各种奇迹，从巧妙地伪装成普通家具的锁箱到无与伦比的奇迹，如蒸汽操作的机械管弦乐队、为移动巨大重量的重型发动机提供动力的蒸汽 \"龙\"，以及精致的轨道和航海工具。每件展品下面都贴有小卡片，说明这些奇特工具的用途，并注明发明者和原产地（如果知道）。",
	"Persistent rumors hold that a hidden treasure vault, guarded by clockwork monsters, lies beneath the Hall of Wonders. These tales are true: beneath the grand altar in the Hall of Wonders is a complex pressure-plate system that opens a secret passageway leading beneath the temple. One can follow this path to a series of saferooms secured by mechanical devices. Some saferooms hold treasures of the faith, while others are rented to wealthy individuals who wish to keep their prizes under the highest possible security.": "顽固的传言认为，奇迹大厅下面有一个隐藏的宝库，由发条怪兽看守。这些传说是真实的：在奇迹大厅的大祭坛下面有一个复杂的压力板系统，可以打开一条通往神庙下面的秘密通道。人们可以沿着这条通道来到一系列由机械装置固定的安全室。一些保险室存放着信仰的宝物，而另一些则租给那些希望将其奖品置于最高安全级别的富人。",
	"The Helm and Cloak draws an unusual mixture of well-heeled but unpretentious patriars, traveling nobles, famed bards, and socially ambitious Lower City residents hoping to rub shoulders with the elite. The inn is unfussy, but conducts its service with flawless technique and the finest ingredients: it serves roast chicken rather than peacocks or partridges, and the fish never have that distinctive Gray Harbor film.": "舵手和斗篷吸引了一群不同寻常的混合体，他们是富裕但朴实无华的爱国者、旅行的贵族、著名的吟游诗人，以及希望与精英擦肩而过的有社会抱负的下城居民。这家旅馆并不挑剔，但以完美的技术和最好的原料进行服务：它提供的是烤鸡，而不是孔雀或鹌鹑，鱼也从来没有那种独特的灰色港湾膜。",
	"The establishment consists of two buildings joined as a single enterprise. The Helm is a rooming house with an entryway shadowed by an immense iron helm that supposedly belonged to a fire giant. The Cloak, slightly smaller, is signaled by the bright flutter of a Sunite cloak draped over its porch. Both buildings are decorated with adventuring trophies both exotic and mundane, including a bronze-horned marble unicorn bust in the Helm's common room. Its horn, which patrons often rub for good luck, is as shiny as the day it was made.": "该机构由两座建筑组成，是一个单一的企业。舵手 \"是一间客房，入口处有一个巨大的铁盔，据说属于一个火巨人。斗篷屋略小，门廊上披着的苏尼特斗篷明亮地飘动着，是它的标志。这两座建筑都装饰着异国情调和世俗的冒险战利品，包括舵手室里的青铜角大理石独角兽半身像。它的角，顾客们经常摩擦它以获得好运，就像它被制造出来的那天一样闪闪发光。",
	"The High Hall is the center of almost all governmental activity in Baldur's Gate. The Parliament of Peers and the Council of Four meet here, and each of the four dukes has a sumptuous office and discreetly appointed meeting rooms. Criminal trials, tax counts, and professional guild meetings also take place in the High Hall.": "大厅是博德之门中几乎所有政府活动的中心。议员大会和四人会议在这里举行，四位公爵中的每一位都有一个豪华的办公室和谨慎的会议室。刑事审判、税收统计和职业公会会议也在高级大厅进行。",
	"Most criminal trials are presided over by a proxy judge appointed by one of the four dukes, and most are resolved as a simple administrative matter that proceeds from arraignment to sentencing within minutes. Unless an impartial witness or evidence of questionable circumstances is brought to the court's attention, the word of a Flaming Fist or Watch officer suffices to convict, and the judge has only to stamp a seal on the paperwork that the guards have already prepared. This results in a certain degree of corruption, naturally, which is compounded by the proxy judge's near-absolute discretion in deciding whether to accept a conviction or exonerate a suspect. Bribery and influence-peddling run rife through the courts, where honest judges are rare and widely feared.": "大多数刑事审判是由四位公爵之一任命的代理法官主持的，而且大多数是作为简单的行政事务解决的，从提审到判刑只需几分钟。除非有公正的证人或有问题的证据引起法庭的注意，否则火焰之拳或守夜人的一句话就足以定罪，而法官只需在守卫已经准备好的文件上盖个章。这自然会导致一定程度的腐败，而代理法官在决定是否接受定罪或免除嫌疑人的责任时，几乎有绝对的自由裁量权，这使腐败更加严重。贿赂和权钱交易在法庭上比比皆是，诚实的法官很少，而且广为人知。",
	"In addition to hosting trials, the High Hall holds libraries containing all local laws and ordinances, summaries of judicial decisions and trial outcomes, deed records, guild charters, census tallies, and family genealogies for all the noble houses and sufficiently important commoners. The records go back to the city's founding, encompassing centuries of meticulously maintained documents. The libraries don't share a common index, and sorting through their overlapping and idiosyncratically organized holdings can be confusing, so most people opt to pay one of the resident librarians to locate what they need.": "除了主持审判外，高堂还拥有包含所有当地法律和条例、司法裁决和审判结果摘要、契约记录、行会章程、人口普查数据以及所有贵族家族和足够重要的平民的家谱的图书馆。这些记录可以追溯到城市的建立时期，包含了几个世纪以来精心维护的文件。这些图书馆没有一个共同的索引，而且对其重叠和特异性组织的馆藏进行分类可能会让人感到困惑，所以大多数人选择付钱给一个常驻图书馆管理员来寻找他们需要的东西。",
	"Finally, the ground floor of the High Hall's easternmost wing contains a museum to the history of Baldur's Gate and a mausoleum for its many dukes and heroes. Statues of ancient notables, including Balduran himself, loom over caskets containing their dusty bones—or, in Balduran's case, a glass casket containing all that lingers from the city's vanished founder: the age-cracked remnants of his cloak, longsword, shield, and favorite spyglass.": "最后，大礼堂最东边的底层有一个博德之门历史博物馆和一个公爵和英雄的陵墓。包括Balduran本人在内的古代知名人士的雕像在装着他们尘封的骨头的棺材上晃动，或者，在Balduran的案例中，一个玻璃棺材里装着这个城市消失的创始人的所有东西：他的斗篷、长剑、盾牌和最喜欢的望远镜等岁月裂痕的残骸。",
	"This vast workshop is the center of Gond's religion in Baldur's Gate. Every day, the anvils and worktables that fill the High House of Wonders ring with the clamor of hammer and saw. Under the scrutiny of the meticulous High Artificer Andar Beech, a neutral male human {@creature priest}, inventors work alongside priests and acolytes beside masters of all disciplines. Because the creations in these workshops are largely experimental prototypes, they are not deemed fit for public view.": "这个巨大的工场是《博德之门》中贡德宗教的中心。每天，装满高级奇迹之屋的铁砧和工作台面都会响起锤子和锯子的喧闹声。在一丝不苟的高级工匠安达尔-比奇（Andar Beech）的监督下，发明家们与牧师和圣徒们一起工作，与各学科的大师们一起工作。因为这些工场的创作主要是实验性的原型，所以它们被认为不适合公开展示。",
	"Gond's temple doesn't flourish in Baldur's Gate by simple happenstance. While there are certainly more industrious and academic cities along the Sword Coast, in few other places could Gond's faithful have access to more and rarer resources with less oversight. The city cares more about the clerics' innovations than the morality of those creations or how they came into being. Rumors claim that the High House of Wonders maintains a secret testing facility in or just outside the city.": "冈德的神庙在博德之门的繁荣并不是简单的偶然。虽然剑海岸上确实有更多勤奋和学术的城市，但在其他地方，很少有贡德的信徒能在较少的监督下获得更多和更稀有的资源。这个城市更关心神职人员的创新，而不是那些创造的道德或它们是如何产生的。有传言称，高级奇迹之家在城内或城外有一个秘密测试设施。",
	"Ostensibly, Gond's priests offer healing and other magical services to anyone willing to pay. However, priests often prove so caught up with their projects that they're reticent to attend to any but those with the most novel wounds and provocative ailments.": "表面上看，冈德的牧师为任何愿意付费的人提供治疗和其他魔法服务。然而，牧师们常常被他们的项目所吸引，除了那些最新奇的伤口和挑衅性的疾病外，他们不愿意为任何人服务。",
	"The power of the Hhunes waxes and wanes like the moon, but other patriar families maintain a healthy fear of them because the Hhunes have powerful connections up and down the Sword Coast that could make life difficult for would-be rivals.": "胡恩家族的势力像月亮一样忽高忽低，但其他父系家族对他们保持着健康的恐惧，因为胡恩家族在剑海岸上下都有强大的关系，可以让潜在的竞争对手难以生存。",
	"Lutecia's valet is Kaddrus, a {@creature cambion} that takes the form of a strikingly handsome man half her age. Kaddrus was sent by powerful nobles in Tethyr to protect the Hhune family's secrets, which include a connection to the Knights of the Shield, a secret society tied to the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}. This shield recently disappeared from the crypts under the Hhune estate, and Kaddrus is assisting efforts to get the shield back and punish those responsible for its theft. Lutecia is content to leave this task in his capable hands.": "Lutecia的男仆是Kaddrus，一个{@creature cambion}年龄只有她一半大的英俊男子的形态。卡德鲁斯被泰特希尔的有权势的贵族们派来保护胡内家族的秘密，其中包括与盾牌骑士的联系，这是一个与（1%）有联系的秘密社团。这个盾牌最近从Hhune庄园下的地窖里消失了，Kaddrus正在协助努力找回盾牌并惩罚那些对其被盗负有责任的人。鲁特西亚很满意把这项任务交给他的能力。",
	"Tymora's temple in Baldur's Gate is made of local yellow granite, roofed with slate shingles, and inconspicuously blended into the surrounding architecture. Recently added to the structure are beautiful mosaics depicting souls prevailing against ill fortune at sea.": "泰莫拉在博德之门的神庙由当地的黄色花岗岩制成，屋顶是石板瓦，不显眼地与周围的建筑融为一体。最近在结构上增加了美丽的马赛克，描绘了灵魂在海上战胜厄运的景象。",
	"Other than holding formal religious observances—which most of Tymora's faithful only attend on major holidays—the primary purpose of the temple is to accept requests, and large donations, from petitioners seeking the temple's intercession. For countless reasons, Baldurians are reluctant to trust the Watch, the Flaming Fist, or the Guild. When they find it necessary to seek aid from an influential organization, such people often turn to Lady Luck for help. The Lady's Hall is there to hear their pleas, and to accept their offerings in exchange. While such intercession often takes the form of blessings, magical or otherwise, clergy moved by a tale of exceptional injustice might be swayed to petition the church elders to intercede. Such happens rarely, the church being unwilling to jeopardize its standing by pitting itself against every specific injustice laid at its doorstep. Yet, members of the clergy often anonymously reach out to the adventurers that congregate near their temple, sponsoring small acts of justice whenever they can.": "除了举行正式的宗教仪式--大多数泰莫拉的信徒只有在重大节日才会参加--神庙的主要目的是接受寻求神庙代祷的请愿者的请求和大量捐款。出于无数的原因，Baldurians不愿意相信守望者、火焰之拳或公会。当他们发现有必要向有影响力的组织寻求援助时，这些人往往会向幸运女神寻求帮助。女士大厅在那里听取他们的请求，并接受他们的供品作为交换。虽然这种代祷通常采取的是魔法或其他形式的祝福，但神职人员被一个特殊的不公正故事所打动，可能会向教堂的长老请愿，要求他们代祷。这种情况很少发生，因为教会不愿意通过反对摆在其门口的每一个具体的不公正现象而危及其地位。然而，神职人员经常匿名向聚集在他们寺庙附近的冒险者伸出援手，只要他们有能力，就会赞助一些小的正义行动。",
	"Six stories high and built of weathered red brick in a cylindrical, pagoda-style structure, Ramazith's Tower is considered a unique landmark by some and a regrettable eyesore by others. It was built nearly a century ago by the eccentric wizard Ramazith, a sailor from faraway Durpar who acquired a vast knowledge of the deeps—and equally vast wealth. Ramazith had not been known as either an exceptional mariner or an exceptional arcanist before he came into enough money to build his tower, and the source of his success remains a mystery.": "拉玛兹塔有六层楼高，由风化的红砖建成，是一个圆柱形的宝塔式结构，一些人认为它是一个独特的地标，而另一些人则认为它是一个令人遗憾的障碍物。它是由古怪的巫师拉马兹斯在近一个世纪前建造的，他是一个来自遥远的杜尔帕的水手，获得了大量的深海知识--同样也获得了大量的财富。在他有足够的钱建造他的塔之前，Ramazith并不以杰出的航海家或杰出的奥术师而闻名，他的成功来源仍然是个谜。",
	"Not long after the tower was completed, Ramazith died under suspicious circumstances. Some say he met his end after an ill-fated dalliance with a nymph, but rumors have always persisted that his death was linked to his unlikely ascent. One version holds that the nymph exacted revenge for some terrible crime Ramazith committed against her people to gain his power, while another rumor suggests his soul was itself the price of his bargain. Whatever the truth, Ramazith's tower stood empty for decades before it was acquired a few years ago by Lorroakan, a young and short-tempered mage known for having expensive tastes and a perpetual shortage of funds. Lorroakan hails from the city of Athkatla to the south, and local gossip holds that he's a disgraced Cowled Wizard who may even be a fugitive from the powerful House Selemchant in Amn.": "塔建成后不久，拉马兹思就死于可疑的情况。有些人说他是在与一位仙女的不伦之恋后遭遇不幸的，但一直有传言说他的死亡与他不可能的登塔有关。一个版本认为，这位仙女是为了报复拉玛兹思对她的人民犯下的一些可怕罪行而获得他的权力，而另一个传言则认为他的灵魂本身就是他交易的代价。无论真相如何，拉玛兹思的塔在几年前被罗罗坎收购之前已经空了几十年，罗罗坎是一个年轻的、脾气暴躁的法师，以品味昂贵和长期缺乏资金而闻名。Lorroakan来自南部的Athkatla市，当地的流言蜚语认为他是一个失宠的Cowled巫师，甚至可能是Amn强大的Selemchant家族的一个逃犯。",
	"Lorroakan's ever-pressing need for money has led the mage to begin looking for hired hands who might be willing to venture into the long-shuttered heights of Ramazith's tower and uncover the secret of the late wizard's wealth. That Ramazith's secret may have brought him to an untimely end, and that Lorroakan is himself no more skilled—and perhaps significantly less so—than the tower's previous master does not seem to concern him.": "Lorroakan对钱的需求越来越大，这使得法师开始寻找可能愿意冒险进入Ramazith塔的长期封闭的高度并揭开这位已故巫师的财富秘密的雇佣者。拉玛兹思的秘密可能使他过早地结束了生命，而洛洛亚肯本人的技术也不比塔的前任主人高明，也许还差得远，这似乎与他无关。",
	"Realizing that her family needed a long term source of financial support, Yvandre opened a sword-wielding school in a guest house adjoining her family's estate. The Rillyn School is about to graduate its first class of students, all of whom have trained with Yvandre for at least five years and have won her approval with their skill. As Yvandre is a hard teacher, this is an impressive feat, and her students are justly proud. She hopes that they'll spread her name throughout the region and win acclaim for the school. In the meantime, she continues to enroll young students, keeping those with promise and weeding out the rest. Some of those who failed to make the cut, embittered by their perceived humiliation, nurse grudges against Yvandre and her house.": "意识到她的家庭需要一个长期的经济支持来源，伊万德在毗邻她家庄园的一个招待所里开办了一所持剑学校。里昂学校即将毕业第一届学生，他们都在伊万德尔那里训练了至少五年，并以其技术赢得了她的认可。由于伊万德勒是个刻苦的老师，这是一个令人印象深刻的成就，她的学生有理由感到自豪。她希望他们能在整个地区传播她的名字，为学校赢得赞誉。同时，她继续招收年轻学生，保留那些有前途的学生，淘汰其余的学生。一些没有被录取的学生，因为认为自己受到了羞辱而愤愤不平，对伊万德和她的房子怀恨在心。",
	"Named for its sign, three lashed-together barrels hanging from a pole, the Three Old Kegs is popular with current and retired members of the Flaming Fist. It serves simple and hearty meals, keeps a variety of good-quality but inexpensive wines and beers, and tolerates no rowdiness among its clientele. Rooms are available for both short- and long-term stays, and the Three Old Kegs offers laundry, mending, repair, and sharpening services to its guests. Its reasonable prices and welcoming atmosphere have led several retired Flaming Fist mercenaries to adopt the place as a full-time residence. These long-term regulars act as additional security, making the Three Old Kegs one of the safest places for visitors to stay in Baldur's Gate.": "三只老酒桶 \"因其招牌而得名，即在一根杆子上挂着三只绑在一起的酒桶，受到火焰之拳现任和退役成员的欢迎。它提供简单而丰盛的饭菜，保存着各种质量好但价格低廉的葡萄酒和啤酒，并且不容忍顾客之间的吵闹。房间可供短期和长期居住，\"三只老酒桶 \"为客人提供洗衣、补衣、修理和磨刀等服务。其合理的价格和温馨的氛围使几个退休的火焰之拳雇佣兵将这里作为一个全职住所。这些长期的常客充当了额外的保安，使 \"三只老酒桶 \"成为博德之门中最安全的游客住宿地之一。",
	"Beneath the Wide is a maze of storage chambers, ale cellars, and cobwebbed tunnels known collectively as the Undercellar. Archways, many with iron-barred gates and rusty but functional locks, connect one cobbled chamber to the next. Some tunnels ascend to street-level buildings, while others open through grates and sewer covers to the streets themselves. At least two dozen ways into and out of the Undercellar exist, although only a few are widely known, and some are deliberately kept secret.": "广场下面是一个由储藏室、酒窖和蜘蛛网般的隧道组成的迷宫，统称为地下酒窖。拱门，许多都有铁栅栏门和生锈但实用的锁，将一个鹅卵石室连接到另一个。有些隧道可以上升到街道上的建筑物，而其他隧道则通过栅栏和下水道盖板通向街道本身。至少有二十多条进出地下城的通道，但只有少数几条是广为人知的，还有一些是故意保密的。",
	"Most Baldurians know of the Undercellar as a seedy speakeasy and brothel. The Watch and the Flaming Fist never police the Undercellar, leaving it to a gang of masked toughs who call themselves the Cellarers to enforce order. This near-total absence of the law makes the Undercellar a popular place of business for unsavory characters who would never risk being caught in the Upper City otherwise. Their \"indulgence rooms\" offer gambling, prostitution, exotic intoxicants, and pit fights between animals—such as giant sewer rats pitted against dog-sized spiders. Most ordinary citizens who venture into the Undercellar for a taste of danger keep to these areas.": "大多数巴尔杜尔人都知道地下酒窖是一个肮脏的地下酒吧和妓院。守望者和火焰之拳从不对地下酒窖进行监管，而是由一帮自称酒窖主的蒙面硬汉来维持秩序。这种几乎完全没有法律约束的情况使得地下酒窖成为不怀好意的人做生意的热门场所，否则他们绝不会冒险在上城被抓。他们的 \"放纵室 \"提供赌博、卖淫、异国情调的麻醉品，以及动物之间的搏斗--例如巨大的下水道老鼠与狗大小的蜘蛛之间的搏斗。大多数普通市民为了体验危险而冒险进入地下城的时候，都会选择这些地方。",
	"However, those in search of more serious danger can generally find it. Several gray and black marketeers hold heavily reinforced, Guild-approved secure rooms in the Undercellar, from which they deal in weapons, illicit disguises, counterfeit Watch tokens, rare poisons, and other contraband. Access to these dealers requires Guild approval or significant bribes to the Cellarers.": "然而，那些寻找更严重危险的人一般都能找到它。一些灰色和黑市商人在地下酒窖中拥有经过严格加固的、行会批准的安全房间，他们在那里交易武器、非法伪装、假冒的手表代币、稀有毒药和其他违禁品。要进入这些交易商的房间，需要得到公会的批准，或者向酒窖管理员进行大量的贿赂。",
	"In addition to harboring illicit businesses, the Undercellar is rumored to run throughout much of the Upper City. Its secret tunnels wind beneath numerous patriar manors, banks, businesses, and even the High Hall itself, connecting through false walls in wine cellars and basements throughout the district. Some of the walls are supposedly thin enough for an eavesdropper to overhear all manner of sensitive plans and scandalous liaisons.": "除了窝藏非法企业外，据传暗窖还贯穿上城的大部分地区。它的秘密通道蜿蜒在众多的庄园、银行、企业，甚至是市政厅本身的下面，通过整个地区的酒窖和地下室的假墙连接。有些墙据说很薄，偷听者可以偷听到各种敏感计划和丑闻的联络。",
	"Built of white marble, with an arched roof of vibrant red edged in gold leaf, the temple of Oghma stands out among the surrounding buildings. A wide reflecting pool rests in a deep basin under its roof, which is built with exceptional acoustics so that a speaker's words project clearly and effortlessly across the assembled audience. This has made the shrine a popular place for weddings, dedication ceremonies, and other oaths.": "奥格玛神庙由白色大理石建成，拱形的屋顶是用金箔镶边的鲜艳红色，在周围的建筑中显得格外突出。屋顶下的深盆里有一个宽大的反射池，它的声学效果非常好，所以演讲者的话语可以清晰地投射到聚集在一起的听众身上，毫不费力。这使得该神社成为举行婚礼、献身仪式和其他宣誓的热门场所。",
	"Legend holds that bards and artists who study their own reflections in the basin for half a day, opening their minds to Oghma's will as they do, behold a vision to inspire their next creation. The reflective period can be dawn to dusk, midnight to midday, or any other period. As the Unrolling Scroll stands in the Upper City, though, non-residents of the district are evicted after sundown.": "传说中，吟游诗人和艺术家如果在盆地中研究自己的倒影半天，在研究过程中向奥格玛的意志敞开心扉，就会看到一个激发他们下一步创作的愿景。思考的时间可以是黎明到黄昏，午夜到正午，或任何其他时间。不过，由于 \"展开卷轴 \"矗立在上城，非本区居民在日落后会被驱逐。",
	"The Upper City's guard force uses the Watch Citadel as training grounds, barracks, and organizational offices. A stable holds the Watch's warhorses, while a few jail cells can host ordinary prisoners awaiting transport to trials in the High Hall or prison in the Seatower of Balduran.": "上城的守卫部队将守望堡作为训练场、军营和组织办公室。一个马厩关押着守望先锋的战马，而一些牢房可以关押普通的囚犯，等待运送到高级大厅的审判或Balduran的Seatower的监狱。",
	"From the Citadel, the Watch runs regular patrols through the Upper City and staffs the Old Wall, day and night. Many Watch officers are patriars themselves, hailing from families with a long and proud tradition of service to Baldur's Gate. As most live in the Upper City, members of the Watch are familiar with the city's patriars and possess a well-developed ability to spot pretenders. Many Watch members interact with citizens from the other districts only at the gates, and then usually under tense and stressful circumstances that foster jaundiced views.": "从城堡出发，守望者在上城进行定期巡逻，并在旧城墙上日夜值守。许多守望者本身就是爱国者，他们来自于为博德之门服务的悠久而自豪的传统家庭。由于大多数人都住在上城，守望先锋的成员熟悉该城的爱国者，并拥有识别伪装者的完善能力。许多守望先锋的成员只在门口与其他地区的市民交流，而且通常是在紧张的环境下进行，这也培养了他们的偏见。",
	"Because few of its members have ever lived outside their privileged walls, the Watch tends to be blind to the day-to-day hardships of life outside the Upper City. Watch soldiers can be suspicious if not outright contemptuous of those whose lower-class mannerisms mark them as \"of poor breeding.\" While most officers attempt to enforce a code of civility toward all Baldurians, a current of antipathy toward the poor runs deep through the Watch, though it more often manifests as condescension than outright hostility. Absent unusual circumstances, the Watch always gives the benefit of the doubt to a patriar or Upper City resident, and never takes an Outer City denizen's word over anyone else's.": "因为很少有成员曾在他们的特权之墙外生活过，所以守望者往往对上层城市以外的日常生活的艰辛视而不见。守望先锋的士兵们对那些举止低俗、\"教养差 \"的人可能会产生怀疑，甚至是直接蔑视。虽然大多数军官都试图对所有Baldurian人执行文明守则，但对穷人的反感在守望先锋中根深蒂固，尽管它更多地表现为居高临下，而不是彻底的敌视。如果没有特殊情况，守望者总是会将怀疑的利益给予爱国者或上层城市的居民，而不会将外城居民的说法置于其他人之上。",
	"Helm's shrine in Baldur's Gate consists of a small chapel flanked by wings at its door and a vigilant eye inscribed in silver above the lintel.

	"When called upon by the Watch or the Flaming Fist, Helm's clergy aids in maintaining the city's walls and turning back those who would storm its gates.

	"Helm's clerics provide healing to any willing to make a donation in gold or arms. They uphold a long-standing tradition of waving this donation for those who suffer grievous wounds in the course of defending other. This leads to all manner of unlikely stories being told at the Watchful Shield's gates, explaining how roughed-up brawlers or Guild cutthroats actually suffered their wounds performing heroic acts.": "赫尔姆的神职人员为任何愿意捐赠黄金或武器的人提供治疗。他们坚持一个长期的传统，为那些在保卫他人的过程中遭受重伤的人挥舞这笔捐款。这导致在守望之盾的门前发生了各种不可能的故事，解释了粗暴的斗士或公会的杀手是如何在执行英雄行为时受伤的。",
	"By law, all commercial buying and selling not done in a licensed and taxed establishment must be conducted in the Wide, the city's most prominent civic space and public market.

Every sunset, vendors cart their unsold wares back out, or pay exorbitantly expensive warehouse storage fees.": "根据法律规定，所有不在有执照和有税收的机构中进行的商业买卖都必须在Wide进行，这是该市最突出的公民空间和公共市场。每天早上，大量的小贩涌入这里摆放摊位，并从一小队搬运工那里取货。每天日落时分，小贩们将他们未售出的商品运回外面，或者支付昂贵的仓库储存费。",
	"In the hours between, the Wide hosts a vibrant, crowded market where fortune-tellers and con artists sit beside dealers hawking spices, fish, furs, perfumes, and every other luxury good to be found across the continent and beyond. Despite its crowds, the Wide is well regulated, the Watch keeping a sharp eye out for pickpockets. Street musicians are forbidden on pain of heavy fines and expulsion from the market, so the Wide proves more subdued than the chaotic markets of the Outer City. Quiet performers, such as puppeteers and sleight-of-hand tricksters, are common.": "在这之间的时间里，Wide有一个充满活力、拥挤的市场，在那里，算命先生和骗子坐在经销商旁边，兜售香料、鱼、毛皮、香水，以及在整个大陆和其他地方可以找到的所有其他奢侈品。尽管人多势众，但 \"宽 \"的管理却很好，守望者对扒手保持高度警惕。街头音乐家是被禁止的，否则将被处以巨额罚款和驱逐出市场，因此，与外城混乱的市场相比，宽阔的市场被证明是比较平和的。安静的表演者，如木偶人和变戏法的人，很常见。",
	"For years the Wide hosted one of the city's most cherished landmarks: the Beloved Ranger, a statue of a powerful warrior in plate mail wearing a cheerful grin and cradling a hamster in his hands. Recently, though, the statue was revealed to be the Rashemi hero, Minsc, and his \"miniature giant space hamster\" companion, Boo, trapped under the effects of petrifying magic. When the magic was dispelled, it freed the heroes to walk the world once more but robbed the Wide of a bit of its charm. The merchants complained loudly, and a replacement statue of Minsc and Boo was promptly commissioned and set atop the pedestal where the actual heroes stood for years.": "多年来，Wide一直是这个城市最珍贵的地标之一：心爱的游侠，一个身穿板甲的强大战士的雕像，他带着欢快的笑容，手里抱着一只仓鼠。但最近，这座雕像被发现是拉希米英雄明斯克和他的 \"微型巨型太空仓鼠 \"伙伴布，被石化魔法所困。当魔法被驱散时，它使英雄们再次行走在世界上，但却夺走了广域的一点魅力。商人们大声抱怨，并迅速委托制作了明斯克和布的替代雕像，并在真正的英雄所站的基座上放置了多年。",
	"A crescent of steeply sloping neighborhoods plays home to the common folk of Baldur's Gate. The Lower City is a chaotic tangle of conjoined, slate-roofed buildings, its narrow cobblestone thoroughfares spanned by bridges and buttresses designed to keep overflowing tenements from tumbling into the streets. As cramped and noisy as the Lower City can be during the day, bustling with business from a thousand shops, the district turns eerily quiet at night. Though lit by street lamps and traversed by hired lantern bearers, the darkened streets are far from safe, and those citizens not running taverns or other late-night establishments tend to lock their doors and bar their colorful window shutters as the river's dense fog rolls in.": "一个由陡峭的街区组成的新月形区域是博德之门的平民百姓的家。下城是一个由连在一起的板顶建筑组成的混乱的纠结体，狭窄的鹅卵石大道被桥梁和扶壁所横跨，以防止溢出的公寓翻到街上去。白天，下城是那么的拥挤和嘈杂，一千多家商店的生意熙熙攘攘，而到了晚上，这个地区却变得异常安静。虽然有路灯照明，并有雇来的灯笼工穿行，但黑暗的街道远非安全，那些不经营酒馆或其他深夜场所的市民往往在河水的浓雾中锁上他们的门，挡住他们五颜六色的窗户。",
	"Nearly everyone in the Lower City is engaged in some sort of trade. Crime of all sorts is rampant, from petty smuggling to outright robbery and murder. Though the city government tries to curtail this by paying the Flaming Fist to patrol the streets, the mercenaries sometimes seem more like an occupying army than a true police force, better suited to indiscriminate head-cracking than delicate investigation. As such, while most residents are happy to shout for the Fist when beset by obvious criminals, they also band together into local crews to better watch each other's backs and settle more subtle scores. In such an environment, laws are often treated as suggestions, and while most residents are just ordinary folks trying to get by, there's truth to the old adage that everyone in Baldur's Gate has a secret to keep.": "在下城，几乎所有人都在从事某种贸易。各种各样的犯罪猖獗，从小规模的走私到赤裸裸的抢劫和谋杀。尽管市政府试图通过支付火焰之拳在街上巡逻来遏制这种现象，但这些雇佣兵有时看起来更像是一支占领军，而不是真正的警察部队，他们更适合于不分青红皂白地敲打脑袋，而不是进行细致的调查。因此，虽然大多数居民在遇到明显的犯罪分子时都乐意为拳头喊话，但他们也会结成当地的团队，以便更好地互相照应，解决更微妙的问题。在这样的环境中，法律往往被视为建议，虽然大多数居民只是试图过日子的普通人，但在博德之门，每个人都有一个秘密要保守，这句老话是真的。",

As the only gate allowing ordinary people through the Old Wall, Baldur's Gate embodies the power imbalance between rich Upper City patriars and Lower City commoners. Once the sole gate leading to the harbor, it's still the primary route by which the city's wealth flows from port to patriar.": "{@b Baldur's Gate}. 博德门是城市中最古老、最不起眼的门，但仍然是城市的心脏。作为唯一允许普通人通过旧城墙的大门，博德门体现了富裕的上城贵族和下城平民之间的权力不平衡。它曾经是通往港口的唯一大门，现在仍然是城市财富从港口流向族长的主要途径。",
	"{@b Basilisk Gate}. Piercing the city's eastern wall, this statue-lined gate connects the Lower City to the great Coast Way, stretching through the majority of the Outer City and then southeast toward Amn, Tethyr, and Calimshan.": "{@b Basilisk Gate}. 穿过城市的东墙，这座雕像林立的大门将下城与伟大的海岸之路连接起来，穿过外城的大部分地区，然后向东南方向延伸至安恩、泰特希尔和卡林山。",
	"{@b Cliffgate}. This foggy minor gate grants access to the Tumbledown neighborhood and its graveyards. Many stories claim that Cliffgate is haunted by the spirits of former citizens seeking reentry to the city and passage back to their homes, but locals know that any mysterious disappearances are more likely the result of a quick mugging and a long fall to the river below.": "{@b Cliffgate}. 这座雾气弥漫的小门允许人们进入翻滚镇（Tumbledown）街区和它的墓园。许多故事声称，悬崖门被以前的市民的灵魂所困扰，他们寻求重新进入城市和回到他们的家，但当地人知道，任何神秘的失踪更可能是快速抢劫和长时间坠落到下面的河流的结果。",
	"General wealth, predominant profession, and traditions divide the Lower City into several neighborhoods. These divisions foster stereotypes and rivalries between city residents, some comical, some age-old insults that can quickly turn violent.": "一般的财富、主要的职业和传统将下城分为几个街区。这些划分促进了城市居民之间的成见和竞争，有些是滑稽的，有些是古老的侮辱，可以迅速变成暴力。",
	"{@b Bloomridge}. The wealthiest and most fashionable Lower City residents gravitate toward the commanding views of Bloomridge, where townhouses squeeze in among upscale boutiques and cafes, their rooftop gardens and tiled terraces creating explosions of cheerful color.": "{@b Bloomridge}. 最富有和最时尚的下城居民都倾向于布卢姆里奇的美景，那里的联排别墅挤在高档精品店和咖啡馆之间，他们的屋顶花园和瓷砖露台创造了欢快的色彩爆炸。",
	"{@b Brampton}. The easternmost Lower City neighborhood, Brampton is notoriously poor, its location making it the worst for residents seeking to serve Upper City denizens—but the best for smuggling in untaxed goods from Rivington.": "{@b Brampton}. 布兰普顿是下城最东边的社区，是出了名的贫穷，它的位置使它成为寻求为上城居民服务的最糟糕的居民，但却是从里夫顿走私未缴税货物的最佳地点。",
	"{@b Eastway}. Home to the Basilisk Gate, Eastway is the city's primary gateway to the Outer City and the world beyond, catering to travelers with its profusion of inns, porters, and caravan supplies, as well as to Outer City residents looking for reasonably priced Lower City luxuries. The flow of travelers and strangers through this neighborhood makes it one of the most dangerous parts of the city, as criminals prey on those unfamiliar with the city and without local ties to avenge them.": "{@b Eastway}. 东道是巴斯里斯克门的所在地，是城市通往外城和外面世界的主要门户，这里有大量的旅店、搬运工和商队用品，满足了旅行者的需求，也满足了外城居民寻找价格合理的下城奢侈品的需求。旅行者和陌生人在这里的流动使这里成为城市最危险的地方之一，因为犯罪分子对那些不熟悉城市、没有本地关系的人进行报复。",
	"{@b Heapside}. A solidly middle-class neighborhood, Heapside has its share of shops but tends to be more residential, catering to the city's workforce with ancient but reasonably priced homes and only a moderate likelihood of being stabbed in the street.": "{@b Heapside}. 作为一个坚实的中产阶级社区，希普赛德有它的商店，但更倾向于住宅，以古老但价格合理的住宅来迎合城市的劳动力，在街上被刺伤的可能性不大。",
	"{@b Seatower}. Everything in this neighborhood revolves around the {@area Seatower of Balduran|3ae|x}. The best armorers and weaponsmiths in the city can be found here, along with residences for Fist mercenaries and their families. Dance halls, fighting dens, taverns, and other delights jockey for position near the fortress's causeway, hoping to be the first place a carousing mercenary stumbles into, and each Flaming Fist payday sees the neighborhood swell into the most boisterous corner of the city as soldiers celebrate with riotous good cheer and flagrant street brawls.": "{@b Seatower}. 这个街区的一切都围绕着{@area Seatower of Balduran|3ae|x}。在这里可以找到城市中最好的装甲师和武器匠，还有拳头雇佣兵和他们的家人的住所。舞厅、格斗场、酒馆和其他娱乐场所都在要塞的堤道附近争夺位置，希望成为狂欢的雇佣兵偶然进入的第一个地方，而每一个火焰之拳的发薪日都会看到这个街区膨胀成城市最喧闹的角落，因为士兵们用暴乱的欢呼和公然的街头争斗来庆祝。",
	"{@b The Steeps}. As the most direct route from the harbor to the Upper City via Baldur's Gate, the Steeps has a natural advantage in securing business from wealthy travelers, and many of the city's most successful merchants maintain lucrative storefronts along its dramatically steep thoroughfares. This also makes it the Lower City neighborhood most likely to be visited by patriars, and thus the Steeps sees more than its fair share of patrols by the Flaming Fist.": "{@b The Steeps}. 作为从港口经博德之门到上城的最直接路线，陡坡区在争取富裕旅客的生意方面有天然的优势，许多城市最成功的商人在其陡峭的大道上开着有利可图的店面。这也使得它成为下城最可能被爱国者访问的街区，因此，陡坡区看到了更多火焰之拳的巡逻。",
	"The fact that city's numerous crews can be based on both geographical and professional communities means that their territories often overlap or stretch beyond the borders of any particular neighborhood. The Harborhands, for instance, can be found across the Lower City wherever a neighborhood touches the water, but would rarely try to flex its claim outside of the actual docks and piers. More common is the situation of groups like the Greengrocers' Guild or the Brethren of Barbers, who operate out of all corners of the city and therefore claim no physical territory at all, banding together only in the interests of their trade. For many such crews, there's often no need for a formal meeting place—they meet whenever and wherever necessary, in shop stockrooms or around kitchen tables, and have little interest in banners and sigils.": "事实上，城市的众多团队可以基于地理和职业社区，这意味着他们的领土经常重叠或延伸到任何特定社区的边界之外。例如，在整个下城，只要有居民区接触到水，就能找到港湾帮，但他们很少试图在实际的码头之外提出要求。更常见的情况是，像杂货商公会或理发师兄弟会这样的团体，他们在城市的各个角落经营，因此根本没有实际的领土，只是为了他们的贸易利益而联合起来。对许多这样的团体来说，通常不需要一个正式的会议场所--他们随时随地都可以开会，在商店的库房里或厨房的桌子旁，对旗帜和标志没有什么兴趣。",
	"Still, there's no denying that certain crews dominate certain corners of the city. Sometimes this is the result of a community forming its own crew in a direct attempt to control and protect its neighborhood. Such is the case with the Bloomridge Dandies, wealthy merchant scions who loudly proclaim that the Flaming Fist isn't doing enough to protect their neighborhood, and who relish the opportunity to display their bravery by patrolling neighborhood taverns wearing expensive swords and purple armbands. More often, physical territory is the result of a citywide crew having a natural local nexus, such as the Porters' Union and the Butchers' Block tending to dominate Eastway, as their members congregate near the Basilisk Gate for easy access to the stockyards and incoming caravans.": "然而，不可否认的是，某些团队在城市的某些角落占主导地位。有时，这是一个社区组建自己的团队的结果，直接试图控制和保护其社区。布卢姆里奇丹迪（Bloomridge Dandies）就是这种情况，他们是富有的商人后代，大声宣称火焰之拳在保护他们的社区方面做得不够好，而且他们很乐意有机会通过佩戴昂贵的剑和紫色臂章在附近的酒馆巡逻来展示他们的勇敢。更常见的情况是，实际领地是一个城市范围内的团队在当地有一个自然的联系，例如搬运工联盟和屠夫街区倾向于支配Eastway，因为他们的成员聚集在Basilisk门附近，以方便进入货场和进货的商队。",
	"Unless there's active conflict between two crews, most members are content to work with members of other crews, and see little point in staking out physical turf. After all, a neighborhood needs many different professions to thrive—carpenters and cooks, grocers and apothecaries—and the fact that siblings and spouses often belong to different crews helps keep inter-crew conflict to a minimum.": "除非两个小组之间有积极的冲突，否则大多数成员都满足于与其他小组的成员一起工作，并认为在物理上争夺地盘没有什么意义。毕竟，一个社区的繁荣需要许多不同的职业--木匠和厨师，杂货商和药剂师，而且兄弟姐妹和配偶往往属于不同的团队，这有助于将团队间的冲突降到最低。",

	"Patronized by all levels of society, Baldur's Mouth is the city's primary news service and gossip rag. Utilizing a small army of lantern bearers, the Mouth spreads news both by selling broadsheets on street corners and by shouting summaries of top stories at passersby. From the slums of the Outer City to the finest manor house sitting rooms, the Mouth is where Baldurians go to be informed, incited, and pleasantly scandalized. While some of the news—such as word of new laws passed by the Council of Four or official election results—is handed down directly by the government, most comes from freelance journalists, and official pronouncements often sit side by side with scathing editorials or unflattering political cartoons of those same officials.": "博德之口 \"受到社会各阶层的青睐，是城市的主要新闻服务和八卦报纸。大嘴利用一小群提灯人，通过在街角卖大字报和对路人喊出热门故事的摘要来传播新闻。从外城的贫民窟到最好的庄园起居室，《大嘴》是巴尔杜尔人获得信息、受到煽动和愉快的丑闻的地方。虽然有些新闻--例如四人议会通过的新法律或官方选举结果--是由政府直接发布的，但大多数是由自由记者发布的，官方声明往往与严厉的社论或对这些官员不恭敬的政治漫画并列在一起。",
	"Baldur's Mouth is a prime source of opportunity for adventurers in the city, as Needle is always looking to hire daring \"investigative reporters\" willing to investigate rumors of strange happenings or procure proof of corruption by the city's elite. Even just reading the broadsheet can present adventure opportunities via advertisements recruiting mercenaries, half-substantiated reports of monster attacks ignored by the Flaming Fist, and more.

	"While Aurayaun was quiet about her past, she had no enemies that Lupin knew about. Lupin furiously rejects the Flaming Fist's conclusion that her wife simply abandoned her. A local vagrant claims to have seen Aurayaun climb up and remove the sign-shield late on the night she went missing, then vanish into an alley with a cloaked figure. Since then, though, Lupin has received parcels containing pieces of the shattered shield, each bearing a tiny constellation upon it. Lupin is convinced it's a map, but to where, and whether that destination is terrestrial or the heavens she doesn't know. She's willing to pay to find out, though.": "虽然欧拉雅云对她的过去很低调，但她没有鲁班知道的敌人。鲁邦愤怒地拒绝了火焰之拳的结论，即她的妻子只是抛弃了她。一个当地的流浪汉声称，在她失踪的那个深夜，他看到奥拉雅云爬了起来，取下了标志牌，然后和一个隐身的身影消失在小巷里。不过，从那时起，鲁邦收到了一些包裹，里面有破碎的盾牌碎片，每块碎片上都有一个小小的星座。鲁邦确信这是一张地图，但要去哪里，以及目的地是陆地还是天堂，她都不知道。不过，她愿意花钱去寻找答案。",
	"Infamous up and down the Sword Coast, the Blushing Mermaid is known as the best tavern and inn in Baldur's Gate for those looking to get their teeth kicked in, or to kick in someone else's. Always one spilled drink away from a brawl, the bar is the sort of place most don't visit unless they're well-armed or with a lot of friends—preferably both. The place takes its name from the life-sized wooden mermaid hanging above the incongruous reception desk, a dozen blackened and withered hands nailed to its body—souvenirs left by those who refused to pay their bill.": "红颜美人鱼在剑海岸上下都很有名，是博德之门中最好的酒馆和旅店，适合那些想打牙祭的人，或者想打别人的人。这家酒吧总是在争吵中被打翻，是那种大多数人不会去的地方，除非他们有足够的武器或者有很多朋友--最好是两者都有。这个地方的名字来自于悬挂在不协调的接待台上方的真人大小的木制美人鱼，十几只发黑和枯萎的手被钉在它的身上，这是那些拒绝付账的人留下的纪念品。",
	"For as long as anyone can remember, the moon elves of the Candulhallow family have managed the city's small fleet of corpse carts. Though family members rarely push carts themselves anymore, their terse agents are a constant sight around the city, picking up the dead and using hand-drawn wagons to haul their shrouded loads to the Shrine of the Suffering or outlying cemeteries, funded by city stipends and tips from grieving loved ones.": "从人们有记忆以来，坎杜尔哈洛家族的月精灵就一直在管理这个城市的小型运尸车队。虽然家族成员已经很少亲自推车了，但他们简明扼要的代理人是城市周围一道永恒的风景线，他们捡起死者，用手拉马车将他们的裹尸布拖到苦难者圣殿或外围的墓地，资金来自城市津贴和悲伤的亲人的小费。",
	"In secret, the Candulhallows have grown quietly rich off a variety of death-related scams. Chief among these is a secret smuggling arrangement with {@creature Nine-Fingers Keene|BGDIA} to conceal contraband in corpses' funeral wrappings, which the guards and toll collectors never check. Even less savory is the harvesting and sale of corpses or their parts for the city's cultists and necromancers. Chief among these latter customers is the family matriarch, Leylenna Candulhallow, a neutral evil female moon elf {@creature mage} who takes the choicest and rarest of the deceased for her experiments, replacing them with pauper's corpses and weighted coffins. Should any of the family's misdealing come to light, it would doubtlessly shock the city to the core and potentially force Leylenna to reveal the elaborate necromantic masterpiece—an evolution of both art and life—that she's been slowly patching together for months in her basement.": "在秘密的情况下，坎杜尔霍洛家族通过各种与死亡有关的骗局悄悄地发了财。其中最主要的是与{@creature Nine-Fingers Keene|BGDIA}的秘密走私安排，将违禁品藏在尸体的裹尸布中，而守卫和收费员从不检查。更为不妙的是，为该市的邪教分子和死灵法师收割和出售尸体或其部分。后者的主要客户是家族族长莱伦娜-坎杜哈洛（Leylenna Candulhallow），她是一个中立的邪恶的女性月精灵（1%），为她的实验收集最优秀和最稀有的死者，用贫民的尸体和加重的棺材取代他们。如果这个家族的任何不正当行为被曝光，无疑会震惊整个城市，并可能迫使Leylenna揭示她精心制作的亡灵魔法杰作--艺术和生活的演变--这是她几个月来在地下室慢慢拼凑出来的。",

Most ordinary patrons never make it past the ground-level offices, yet the majority of the Counting House stretches below, extending down into the mud like a cylindrical stone taproot.

Only the most vetted of humanoid guards are allowed in the Counting House's depths.

Eventually the local government got involved after several overly ambitious patriar scions vanished on ventures hastily outfitted by Eastway Expeditions. Now Shilvin can sell her modest selection of goods and any jungle-related gear only after a ten-day waiting period, helping to ensure that fewer citizens rush off to Chult unprepared. To make up for the resulting loss of business, Shilvin has made connections with several trading (and piratical) ventures in regular need of crew.

Those who come around looking for such things are challenged to a friendly sparring match in the atrium, usually with Garmult. If they impress Garmult, they're welcomed with a laugh and a firm handshake, at which point Garmult is happy to hook the new members up with bodyguarding contracts and other work, taking only a nominal finder's fee. Though not everyone in the Legion is as welcoming of new members, Garmult allows only consensual, nonlethal sparring within their establishment. Few members challenge Garmult's authority for risk of missing out on future contracts.": "虽然任何人都可以付钱给加莫特在 \"大师之家 \"学习，但只有那些获得无旗军团成员资格的人才能在这里社交和找工作。那些来寻找这些东西的人，会在中庭接受友好的比武挑战，通常是与加穆特比试。如果他们给加莫特留下了深刻印象，他们就会受到笑声和坚定的握手欢迎，这时加莫特很乐意为新成员提供保镖合同和其他工作，只收取名义上的介绍费。虽然军团中不是每个人都那么欢迎新成员，但加莫特只允许在他们的机构中进行自愿的、非致命的拼搏。很少有成员挑战加莫特的权威，因为他们有可能失去未来的合同。",
	"Generations ago, an outbreak of extremely contagious dancing croup—a deadly plague that caused those afflicted to cough themselves to death even as their limbs thrashed uncontrollably—caused many Baldurians to rethink their approach to medicine. Requiring individual victims to seek out healing from their respective clergies accelerated the disease's spread as the infected traveled to different houses of worship throughout the city, overwhelming the facilities at each. In the aftermath, the Lower City decided to consolidate. While patriars might still be able to afford house calls and personal priests and physicians, commoners funded the building of a single large facility where everyone could come for treatment. Eager to no longer have every worship service interrupted by contagious congregants, several of the city's temples were only too happy to provide clerics to work in the facility. Of course, coin still determines one's quality of care, the clerics rarely work for free, and those without sufficient funds generally end up in the ominously stained basement with the chirurgeons-in-training—but at least those in need know where they can go for help. Chronically understaffed, especially in those wards catering to poor Outer City residents, the hospital has constant security problems, from angry patients to spontaneously arising undead, unethical or experimental treatments by priests of non-good faiths, or excessive withdrawals from the stores of painkilling narcotics.": "几百年前，一场传染性极强的舞毒症爆发了，这是一种致命的瘟疫，它使患者在四肢不受控制地颤抖时也会咳嗽致死，这使得许多巴尔杜尔人重新思考他们的医疗方法。要求受害者向他们各自的神职人员寻求治疗，加速了疾病的传播，因为感染者前往整个城市的不同礼拜场所，使每个礼拜场所的设施不堪重负。事后，下城决定进行整合。虽然贵族们可能仍然有能力支付上门服务和私人牧师及医生的费用，但平民们却出资建造了一个大型设施，每个人都可以来这里接受治疗。由于渴望不再让每次礼拜都被有传染性的教徒打断，该市的几座寺庙都非常乐意提供神职人员在该设施中工作。当然，硬币仍然决定了一个人的护理质量，神职人员很少免费工作，那些没有足够资金的人通常会在不祥的地下室和正在受训的医生一起工作，但至少有需要的人知道他们可以去哪里寻求帮助。医院长期以来人手不足，尤其是那些为贫困的外城居民服务的病房，不断出现安全问题，从愤怒的病人到自发产生的亡灵，非善良信仰的牧师进行的不道德或实验性治疗，或从止痛麻醉品仓库中提取过多的药物。",
	"It perhaps says something about Baldur's Gate that city officials decided to build the hospital right next to Cliffgate, convenient to the graveyard and as far as possible from the wealthy neighborhoods.": "这也许说明了《博德之门》的特点，城市官员决定将医院建在悬崖门旁边，方便墓地，并尽可能远离富人区。",
	"This low stone bathhouse in the Seatower neighborhood is one of the oldest buildings in the area. Built in the Chessentan style, it features heated pools, echoing halls, and gorgeous tile mosaics.": "这座位于Seatower社区的低矮的石头浴场是该地区最古老的建筑之一。它采用切森特风格建造，具有温水游泳池、回声大厅和华丽的瓷砖马赛克。",
	"This establishment's commitment to discretion also makes the bathhouse the prime venue for paid companionship in the Lower City. Many of the most sought-after courtesans meet their patrons in the Hissing Stones' steamy private rooms, trusting to Merilyn's silence and the house's reputation for business meetings to deflect the suspicion of jealous spouses or gossipy wags. Unlike Merilyn, the Reveler's Union—the city-spanning crew of night-workers—isn't averse to selling secrets teased from the bathhouse's clients, and those looking to purchase such information need only whisper in the right ear here. Though this dichotomy keeps Merilyn herself from officially joining the Union, the crew uses the location as its de facto headquarters, regularly renting out and conducting meetings in its vast central pool.": "这家机构对谨慎的承诺也使澡堂成为下城有偿陪侍的主要场所。许多最抢手的歌妓在嘶嘶石的蒸汽包房里与她们的顾客见面，她们相信梅里林的沉默和这所房子在商业会议上的声誉，以转移嫉妒的配偶或八卦的人的猜疑。与梅里林不同，\"狂欢者联盟\"--遍布全城的夜班工人--并不排斥出售从澡堂客户那里得到的秘密，而那些想要购买此类信息的人只需在这里轻声细语就可以了。虽然这种二元对立使梅里林本人无法正式加入联盟，但该团队将该地点作为其事实上的总部，定期出租并在其巨大的中央水池中进行会议。",
	"The main appeal of Insight Park is the Drawing Tree. Planted by Torimesh and grown to full-size in a matter of days, the tree is of a species no one can identify, and Torimesh steadfastly refuses to say anything about its origins, yet everyone knows its power. When properly entreated by Torimesh, the tree's red bark cracks and curls like parchment. Pulling it carefully away reveals a prophetic scene rendered in bloody sap. These arboreal visions of the future are often cryptic, yet inevitably come to pass. As much as the city's elite would love to harness this power, anyone else attempting to peel the tree's bark or force a prophecy reveals only bark and sends Torimesh into a near-murderous rage. For his part, the druid refuses to work for money, peeling off prophecies only according to the unspoken whims of the tree, or in exchange for bizarre and dangerous favors.": "洞察力公园的主要吸引力是绘图树。这棵树是托里梅什种植的，并在几天内长成了大树，没有人能够识别它的种类，托里梅什坚定地拒绝说出它的来源，但所有人都知道它的力量。当托里梅什正确对待这棵树时，它的红色树皮会像羊皮纸一样开裂和卷曲。把它小心翼翼地拉开，就能看到用血色树液渲染的预言场景。这些树上的未来预言往往是隐晦的，但却不可避免地会成为现实。尽管城市的精英们很想利用这种力量，但其他任何试图剥开树皮或强迫预言的人都只能看到树皮，并使托里梅什陷入近乎谋杀的愤怒之中。就他而言，德鲁伊拒绝为钱而工作，只根据树的无言的奇思妙想来剥离预言，或者用奇异而危险的恩惠来交换。",
	"Jopalin also runs a more traditionally squalid moonflower den in the shop's damp basement, catering to ordinary addicts and those who've become so reliant on the tea that they can no longer pass as normal customers. These sad cases are shuffled in through an entrance in the building next door to avoid suspicion, where a group of thugs presides over several dozen filthy cots, collecting Jopalin's fees and dispensing his moonflower supply. The paranoid Jopalin himself lives in a lavish and heavily booby-trapped loft above the café.": "乔帕林还在店内潮湿的地下室经营着一个更传统的肮脏的月季窝点，为普通的瘾君子和那些对茶的依赖已经到了不能再作为正常顾客的程度的人提供服务。这些可悲的人被从隔壁大楼的一个入口送进来，以避免被怀疑，那里有一群打手主持着几十个肮脏的小床，收取乔巴林的费用并分发他的月季花供应。妄想症患者乔帕林本人住在咖啡馆上方一个奢华且有大量诱杀装置的阁楼里。",
	"This old, three-masted ship rocks gently in the water alongside Stormshore Street Dock on the harbor's eastern side. A notorious festhall and tavern, the ship is no longer seaworthy and is in desperate need of repair.": "这艘古老的三桅船在港口东侧的风暴海岸街码头旁的水中缓缓摇晃。这艘船是一个臭名昭著的宴会厅和酒馆，已经不适合航海，急需修理。",
	"On warm days and evenings, respectable clients can sit at tables on the upper deck beneath hanging lanterns, smoking and drinking between wagers, while a more raucous crowd congregates around bars and gambling tables on the decks below.": "在温暖的日子和晚上，有身份的客人可以坐在上层甲板的吊灯下的桌子旁，在下注的间隙抽烟喝酒，而更喧闹的人群则聚集在下面甲板上的酒吧和赌桌旁。",
	"The only blight in otherwise upscale Bloomridge, this mansion appeared out of nowhere in the middle of the night, taking over a previously vacant lot. Fully staffed with close-lipped servants, the imposing manse hosted a few lavish parties for the Lower City elite, presided over by an eccentric and brooding human wizard named Mandorcai. And then, just as suddenly as he had arrived, Mandorcai shut the manor's doors and vanished from public life. Curious locals who peered through the windows reported a completely empty manor, its furniture looking as though it hadn't been touched in years. Yet soon thereafter, individuals around the city began to receive invitations to visit, written in silver on black paper folded into pentagons.": "这座豪宅是原本高档的布卢姆里奇唯一的污点，它在半夜突然出现，占据了一块之前的空地。这座宏伟的宅邸配备了大量密不透风的仆人，为下城的精英们举办了一些奢华的派对，由一个古怪而忧郁的人类巫师主持，名叫曼多卡伊。然后，就像他突然到来一样，曼多凯关上了庄园的大门，从公共生活中消失了。好奇的当地人透过窗户看到的是一个完全空荡荡的庄园，它的家具看起来就像多年来没有被碰过一样。然而，此后不久，城市周围的人开始收到访问邀请，邀请函用银色写在折成五角形的黑纸上。",
	"Those who entered the mansion for the requested appointments never emerged. After a handful of such disappearances, a Flaming Fist squad smashed its way into the building. Only two of its members emerged, babbling about shifting rooms and blood-soaked abattoirs filled with writhing hooks and chains. With no laborers willing to tear the place down, the Council of Four boarded up the doors but left the mansion standing. For decades now, no one has been observed going in or out. Whether the little black invitations that still occasionally appear on citizens' doorsteps are genuine or harmless pranks remains anyone's guess.": "那些进入公馆参加要求的约会的人从未出现过。在经历了几次这样的失踪之后，一支火焰拳的小队冲进了大楼。只有两名成员出现了，他们喋喋不休地谈论着变幻莫测的房间和被血浸透的屠宰场，里面充满了蠕动的钩子和铁链。由于没有工人愿意拆毁这个地方，四人委员会用木板封住了大门，但却留下了这座豪宅。几十年来，没有人看到有人进出。偶尔出现在市民门前的黑色小邀请函是真的还是无害的恶作剧，谁也说不准。",
	"In truth, Mandorcai gained occult knowledge and his magical manor in a bargain with the obese twin {@creature Chain Devil||chain devils} Kyrix and Valisog. For years Mandorcai upheld his side of the contract by bringing the fiends mortal sacrifices, until an accidental breach of contract let the devils haul him screaming into the Nine Hells. Since then, the mansion's hungry traps and shape-changing powers have lain dormant. Recently, however, a group of {@creature Cultist||cultists} have broken into the house, seeking to harness its fell powers. Though they haven't yet figured out how to commune with the chain devils yet, when they do, it'll likely be without the safeguards Mandorcai managed to negotiate, potentially resulting in fiendish disaster for the whole neighborhood.": "事实上，曼多凯是在与肥胖的双胞胎(%0)基里克斯和瓦里索格的交易中获得神秘知识和他的魔法庄园的。多年来，曼多凯通过为恶魔提供致命的祭品来维护他的契约，直到一次意外的违约让恶魔们把他拖入九层地狱。从那时起，这座宅邸的饥饿陷阱和变身能力就一直处于休眠状态。然而，最近，一群{@creature Cultist||cultists}的人闯入了这所房子，试图利用它堕落的力量。虽然他们还没有想出如何与链魔交流，但当他们这样做时，很可能没有曼多凯设法协商的保障措施，可能会给整个社区带来恶魔般的灾难。",
	"The headquarters of the Flaming Fist stands on a rocky islet in the harbor, its sheer walls erupting from the stone in such a way as to grant invaders from the sea few footholds. From the fortress's five stout towers, specially made Gondan trebuchets stand ready to hurl stones three times the distance of an ordinary siege weapon, giving the fortress command of not just the entire harbor but the opposite bank of the river as well. Any invading ships not intimidated by such death from above would also have to contend with the massive chain running from the Seatower to pilings under the easternmost wharf in Brampton. A capstan in the tower can raise the chain, stretching it across the harbor mouth and keeping anything larger than a rowboat from entering or leaving. As for land-based attacks, the 400-foot-long causeway connecting the Seatower's islet to the shore needs no gates or drawbridges, as any attackers foolish enough to charge along its length would be easy marks for the wall's archers.": "火焰之拳的总部矗立在港口的一个岩石小岛上，它的峭壁从石头中喷涌而出，使来自海上的入侵者几乎没有立足之地。从堡垒的五座坚固的塔楼上，特制的贡丹风车随时准备投掷三倍于普通攻城武器的石头，使堡垒不仅可以指挥整个港口，还可以指挥河的对岸。任何没有被这种从上而下的死亡所吓倒的入侵船只也将不得不与从海塔到布兰普顿最东边的码头下的桩基的巨大链条抗衡。塔楼上的绞盘可以提升链条，使其横跨港湾，并阻止任何比划艇更大的东西进入或离开。至于陆地上的攻击，连接海塔小岛和海岸的400英尺长的堤道不需要大门或吊桥，因为任何愚蠢到沿着堤道冲锋的攻击者都会成为城墙上的弓箭手的目标。",
	"Roughly a hundred Flaming Fist soldiers occupy the fortress at any given time, along with the residents of the Officers' Tower. In the central bailey, the organization's vast armory holds every weapon a mercenary company could need, along with trophies from campaigns abroad, a priceless library of war-related texts, and more. Rumors also speak of the Fist's treasury, kept in a lead-lined vault somewhere beneath the Officers' Tower and surrounded by yards of solid stone, the secret doors leading to its vaults hidden by clever mechanisms and cleverer magic.": "在任何时候，都有大约一百名火焰之拳的士兵和军官楼的居民占据着这个堡垒。在中央大院里，该组织庞大的军械库里存放着一个雇佣兵公司可能需要的每一件武器，以及海外战役的战利品，一个无价的战争相关文本的图书馆，等等。谣言还提到了拳头公司的金库，它被保存在军官塔下的某个铅制金库里，周围是一码码的坚固石头，通往金库的秘密大门被巧妙的机制和更巧妙的魔法所隐藏。",
	"In addition to defending the city, the Seatower also serves as the local prison of Baldur's Gate. Three levels of dungeons extend beneath it, the lower two below sea level and integrating part of a naturally occurring cavern system. This both keeps the prison secure and pacifies prisoners, as any who act out know that they can always be moved from the dry cells to the dank lower levels. Particularly problematic inmates end up in the Swimming Hole—a flooded and lightless shaft where prisoners must constantly tread water or risk drowning, while also fending off the blind, biting shrimp that dwell there. Though long-term incarceration is rare in the city, there are always a few inmates rotting in these cells, ranging from petty criminals to political prisoners locked away on trumped-up charges.": "除了保卫城市之外，Seatower也是博德之门的地方监狱。它下面有三层地牢，较低的两层低于海平面，与自然形成的洞穴系统结合在一起。这既保证了监狱的安全，也安抚了囚犯，因为任何有行为的人都知道，他们总是可以从干燥的牢房转移到潮湿的下层。特别有问题的囚犯最终会被关进游泳洞--一个被水淹没、没有光线的竖井，囚犯必须不断地踩水，否则就会有被淹死的危险，同时还要抵御住在那里的盲目、咬人的虾子。虽然长期监禁在这个城市很少见，但总有一些囚犯在这些牢房里腐烂，从轻罪犯到以莫须有的罪名被关押的政治犯。",
	"Ambitious and thoroughly amoral, Skoond rose to prominence as the Council of Four's wizard, doing regular favors for the council to further his own plots. Though rarely home, he boards four alchemist lackeys in the building, along with several guards, using the secret passages to cover their comings and goings. Their only job is to uncover and map out as many of the building's secrets as possible—one of the histories Skoond read suggested that the building's original architect had died while smuggling a rare magical tome, leading him to suspect that it still lies hidden in the house's walls.": "斯科恩德野心勃勃，完全不道德，作为四人议会的巫师而崭露头角，经常为议会提供帮助，以推进自己的阴谋。虽然很少在家，但他把四个炼金术士的走狗和几个警卫一起安置在大楼里，利用秘密通道掩护他们的来往。他们唯一的工作就是尽可能多地揭开并描绘出这栋建筑的秘密--斯考恩德读到的历史表明，这栋建筑最初的建筑师是在偷运一本罕见的魔法书时死亡的，这让他怀疑这本书仍然藏在房子的墙壁里。",
	"Like many port cities, Baldur's Gate has traditionally dumped its sewage downstream and let the river carry its problems elsewhere. As the city grew, however, this began to dangerously pollute the river, leading a coalition of druids and patriars to construct the Sewer Keep.": "像许多港口城市一样，博德之门传统上将污水倾倒在下游，让河流将问题带到其他地方。然而，随着城市的发展，这开始对河流造成了危险的污染，导致德鲁伊和守护者的联盟建造了下水道城堡。",
	"A series of three towers built into the walls at the western end of the Seatower neighborhood, the facility was intended to treat the sewage just before it enters the river, using vast enclosed holding tanks of magically augmented plants to purify the effluent. Though the facility was a marvel of magical ecological engineering, the public proved singularly unwilling to care about their waste, and funding quickly collapsed. Since then, the Keep has been a shadow of its intended glory, struggling to keep the worst of Baldur's Gate from the waterway.": "该设施由三座塔组成，建在Seatower社区西端的墙壁上，目的是在污水进入河道之前对其进行处理，使用巨大的封闭式储水池，用魔法增强的植物来净化污水。虽然该设施是一个神奇的生态工程的奇迹，但事实证明，公众完全不愿意关心他们的废物，而且资金很快就崩溃了。从那时起，这个堡垒就成了它本来的荣耀的影子，它努力地把博德之门最糟糕的东西挡在水道之外。",
	"Today, the facility still operates, but mostly as a headquarters and cover for the Sewerkeepers crew. Most of the \"druids\" and technicians running the plant are anything but—instead, they're a specialized thieving crew that uses the keep's position to pass unseen through the city's network of sewer pipes and cisterns. From this warren of tunnels, they can smuggle goods and conduct daring burglaries, as well as occasionally acting as subterranean monster-hunters and paid guides through the city's guts.": "今天，该设施仍在运作，但主要是作为下水道管理员团队的总部和掩护。大多数管理工厂的 \"德鲁伊 \"和技术人员都不是这样的--相反，他们是一个专门的盗贼团队，利用守卫的位置，在城市的下水道管道和蓄水池网络中不被发现。他们可以从这个隧道网中走私货物，进行大胆的盗窃，偶尔也会充当地下怪物猎手和城市内的付费导游。",
	"The oldest temple in Baldur's Gate, the Water Queen's House clings to its enormous pier like a monster of the deep, its stone walls trailing over the side and descending down beneath the waves and river mud. At the pier's tip, a huge fountain in the shape of a sinking ship sprays water high, reminding faithful of the price of failing to appease Umberlee.": "作为博德之门最古老的神庙，水女王之家就像一个深海怪物一样紧贴在巨大的码头上，它的石墙拖在边上，在海浪和河泥的下面往下掉。在码头的顶端，一个巨大的沉船形状的喷泉将水喷得很高，提醒着信徒们不能安抚翁贝里的代价。",
	"Though no outsiders know exactly how the temple's finances work, the dour waveservants buy little in the markets save essentials. The rest of the tithes are carried in solemn procession down crumbling, moss-covered stairs that cling to the outside of the temple and descend into the murky water. The waveservants disappear below the water for a few minutes, only to return empty-handed. What happens to the treasures is anyone's guess, with some suggesting they're hidden in underwater vaults. Others believe the gifts are borne away by Umberlee herself. In truth, the waveservants leave the treasures at the bottom of the staircase, where they are fetched within the hour by {@dice 2d6} {@creature sahuagin} led by a {@creature sahuagin priestess}. The sahuagin make the long trip from the Sea of Swords to obtain these treasures, and in exchange, they refrain from attacking the city, its harbor, and ships heading out to sea.": "虽然没有外人知道寺庙的财务是如何运作的，但沉闷的浪人在市场上几乎不买东西，除了必需品。其余的什一税在庄严的队伍中被抬下破败的、布满青苔的楼梯，这些楼梯紧贴着寺庙的外面，并下降到阴暗的水中。浪人在水底消失了几分钟，最后空手而归。谁也不知道这些宝物会发生什么，有些人认为它们被藏在水下的地下室里。还有人认为这些礼物被Umberlee自己带走了。事实上，海员们把宝物留在了楼梯的底部，在那里，他们会在一小时内被{@dice 2d6}{@creature sahuagin}由{@creature sahuagin priestess}带领的人取走。萨瓦金人从剑海长途跋涉来获取这些宝物，作为交换，他们不会攻击城市、港口和出海的船只。",
	"If the waveservants wish harm to befall a ship or its crew, they leave a clam with the treasure in the water. When the clam is opened, it magically recites up to 25 words in Common. This information helps the sahuagin identify the ship. The sahuagin priestess uses a {@spell tongues} spell to translate the clam's words, then executes an attack on the ship during the next new moon.": "如果海浪人希望船只或其船员受到伤害，他们会在水中留下一个装有宝物的蚌壳。当蛤蜊被打开时，它会神奇地背诵最多25个普通词汇。这些信息可以帮助萨瓦金人识别这艘船。萨瓦金女祭司用一个{@spell tongues}的法术来翻译蛤蜊的话，然后在下一个新月期间对该船进行攻击。",
	"Dirty and uncouth, the Outer City holds everything the elite of Baldur's Gate resist allowing within their walls: the poor, refugees, tanneries and stockyards, and other industries that offend highborn sensibilities. Stretching forth from each of the city's external gates, the Outer City sprawls in a chaotic tangle of shanties and shops, carts and tents lining the roads in hopes of bleeding off enough city trade for their owners to survive. And indeed, much of the commerce in Baldur's Gate happens in these unregulated markets, with even patriars shopping from inside perfumed litters.": "肮脏而粗野的外城容纳了博德之门的精英们所不允许的一切：穷人、难民、制革厂和畜牧场，以及其他触犯高尚情感的行业。外城从城市的每一个外部大门延伸出来，在混乱的纠结中，棚屋和商店、马车和帐篷在道路两旁排列，希望为它们的主人提供足够的城市贸易来生存。事实上，博德之门的大部分商业活动都发生在这些不受管制的市场上，甚至有爱国者从香喷喷的轿子里购物。",
	"While smaller neighborhoods such as Tumbledown and Blackgate squat outside their respective gates, the majority of the Outer City runs along the Coast Way as it curves around the foot of Duskhawk Hill, between Wyrm's Crossing and the city proper. Residents of these neighborhoods are not technically citizens and receive no representation in the government, nor do they receive the benefit of the city's police forces. The Flaming Fist rarely patrols the Outer City, usually emerging only to pursue Outer City residents for crimes committed within the walls.": "虽然较小的社区，如Tumbledown和Blackgate蹲在他们各自的门外，但外城的大部分都是沿着海岸线，因为它在黄昏之鹰山脚下弯曲，在Wyrm's Crossing和城市本身之间。这些街区的居民在技术上不是公民，在政府中没有代表权，也没有得到城市警察部队的帮助。火焰之拳很少在外城巡逻，通常只出现在追捕外城居民在城墙内犯下的罪行。",

	"Visitors approaching Baldur's Gate by road first pass through the Outer City's ramshackle neighborhoods, their traffic hemmed in by cook fires, market stalls, and industries too noisy or repugnant for more genteel citizens. Here travelers must leave any sizable mounts or beasts of burden at one of countless stables and caravanserais before paying the fees to pass through the gates into the city proper. Travelers from the south are twice blessed in this regard, paying once for the bridge at Wyrm's Crossing and again once they've run the gauntlet of Outer City neighborhoods circling Duskhawk Hill.": "从公路上接近博德之门的游客首先要经过外城的破旧街区，他们的交通被炉火、市场摊位和对较有风度的市民来说过于嘈杂或令人厌恶的行业所包围。在这里，旅行者必须将任何大型坐骑或负重牲畜留在无数的马厩和商队中，然后再支付费用通过城门进入城市。从南方来的旅行者在这方面受到两次祝福，一次是在巫妖之桥支付费用，另一次是在绕过黄昏之鹰山的外城街区后支付费用。",

	"{@b Twin Songs}. Standing ready to welcome visitors as they cross the river, Twin Songs is renowned for its enormous diversity of shrines and places of worship, from tiny roadside altars and idols to home-based temples. While those in search of significant magic must still generally visit the larger temples in the city proper, no god is too foreign or obscure to be worshiped in Twin Songs' divine sprawl, where even non-criminal worship of fiends and the Dead Three goes unchallenged.": "{@b Twin Songs}. 当游客过河时，双子星随时准备迎接他们，它以其巨大的神龛和崇拜场所的多样性而闻名，从路边的小祭坛和神像到家庭式的寺庙。虽然那些寻找重要魔法的人一般还是必须去城市里较大的寺庙，但在双子星的神性蔓延中，没有什么神是过于陌生或晦涩难懂的，甚至对恶魔和死亡三人的非犯罪性崇拜也不会受到挑战。",
	"{@b Whitkeep}. This neighborhood takes its name from the white manor house at its center, which houses the city's largest enclave of gnomes.

	"Shortly after Balduran disappeared for the final time, this statue appeared on the cliffs of Tumbledown. Twice the size of the actual man, the statue bears an uncanny likeness to Balduran, squinting west over city and river. While its sudden arrival created something of a stir, most assumed it was simply a tribute to the great man—until one morning several months later when passersby noticed that one of the statue's hands had risen to shade its eyes. Scholars immediately began studying the statue, learning that at sunrise on the first day of each new year, the statue flickers, changing its position in an eyeblink. Though it always looks west, the precise line of its gaze can change by up to thirty degrees, and it may peer through a spyglass, stand with hands on hips, point with an open hand, and so on.": "在Balduran最后一次消失后不久，这座雕像出现在Tumbledown的悬崖上。这座雕像的大小是真人的两倍，它与Balduran有着惊人的相似之处，在城市和河流上向西眯着眼睛。虽然它的突然到来引起了一些轰动，但大多数人都认为这只是对这位伟人的致敬--直到几个月后的一个早晨，路人发现雕像的一只手抬起来遮住了它的眼睛。学者们立即开始研究这座雕像，了解到在每一个新年的第一天日出时，雕像会闪烁，在一个眨眼之间改变其位置。虽然它总是看向西方，但其目光的精确线路可以改变多达30度，它可能通过望远镜观察，双手叉腰站立，用张开的手指向，等等。",
	"For centuries, the predominant theory was that Balduran still lived somewhere far to the west, and the statue tracked his movements. Yet a generation ago, a knight of Oghma vowed to follow the line of the statue's gaze as far as necessary to learn the truth. His journey was shorter than expected. In a wood just a few miles west of the city, he came upon a cylindrical stone building, its open doorway revealing stairs leading down into the forest floor. Atop the building, a smaller statue of Balduran stared back the way he had come. Prevented from entering by a pattern of magical lights he couldn't identify, the knight raced back to the city to gather additional scholars—yet when he returned, the structure was gone. Since then, the forested structure—which popular stories now refer to as Balduran's Tomb—has been discovered three more times in the same fashion, each time in a different location, yet so far no one has been able to enter.": "几个世纪以来，最主要的理论是，Balduran仍然生活在西方某处，而雕像则跟踪他的行动。然而在一代人之前，一位奥格玛的骑士发誓要沿着雕像的视线走到最远，以了解真相。他的旅程比预期的要短。在城市以西几英里的树林里，他看到了一座圆柱形的石头建筑，它敞开的门缝中露出通往森林地面的楼梯。在建筑物的顶部，一尊较小的巴尔杜兰雕像回头注视着他来时的方向。骑士被他无法辨认的魔法灯光图案阻止了进入，他飞快地跑回城市去召集更多的学者--然而当他回来时，这个建筑已经消失了。从那时起，这个森林结构--现在流行的故事称之为Balduran的坟墓--又被发现了三次，每次都是在不同的地点，但至今没有人能够进入。",
	"The value of land and sheer population density in Baldur's Gate means only the wealthiest patriars can afford to bury their dead within the city, interring them in catacombs beneath the city's temples or in family crypts on their own grounds. For everyone else, there's the ignoble Shrine of the Suffering or the scattering of cemeteries outside the city. The largest of the latter is Cliffside Cemetery, located in the Tumbledown neighborhood and employing many local residents as gravediggers, stonemasons, morticians, and professional mourners.": "博德之门的土地价值和纯粹的人口密度意味着只有最富有的族长才有能力在城内埋葬他们的死者，将他们埋葬在城市的寺庙下的地下墓穴或在自己的土地上的家族墓穴。对于其他人来说，可以选择卑鄙的苦难者圣殿或城外零星的墓地。后者中最大的公墓是悬崖边公墓，位于Tumbledown社区，雇用了许多当地居民作为掘墓人、石匠、殡仪员和专业哀悼者。",
	"Long ago, the graveyard was an empty estate owned by the mercantile Szarr family, with only a few family crypts near the cliffs. When a business rival murdered the entire family in their beds, no one was eager to move into their former manor, and the city decided to turn the estate into a single massive graveyard that acts as the primary repository for the city's dead.": "很久以前，这个墓地是一个空荡荡的庄园，由商人Szarr家族拥有，只有悬崖边上的几个家族墓穴。当一个商业对手将整个家族谋杀在床上时，没有人急于搬进他们以前的庄园，于是城市决定将庄园变成一个巨大的墓地，作为城市死者的主要存放地。",
	"The graveyard itself is a maze of crypts and monuments, its organization nearly impossible for outsiders to discern as the multi-chamber ossuaries of rich merchants and pirate lords loom over the simple plaques and rotting wooden holy symbols of the poor. Natural cavern systems have been expanded and shored up to create extensive crypts, yet over generations maps have been lost or poorly updated, and it's not uncommon for a gravedigger to find themselves striking the wood of a coffin where no coffin should be, or tumbling through into a forgotten stretch of tunnel. Rampant grave robbery by brigands and necromancy-obsessed followers of Myrkul only increases the chaos, as bodies get exhumed and reburied wherever it's convenient. Most significantly, a major landslide decades ago dropped a large portion of the cemetery's cliff into the river below, causing the remaining bone-houses and markers to shift and lean, while also exposing numerous crypts and tomb-tunnels to the air, prompting a fresh rush of grave robbing. Though Baldurians rarely bury their dead with valuables anymore, and many of the easier pickings have been taken, it's common wisdom that some of the greatest treasures of past centuries still lie entombed with their heroes, their headstones wiped anonymously clean by wind and rain.": "墓地本身就是一个由墓穴和纪念碑组成的迷宫，外人几乎无法辨别其组织结构，因为富商和海盗领主的多室骨灰盒在穷人的简单牌匾和腐烂的木制圣物上若隐若现。天然的洞穴系统被扩大和加固，形成了广泛的地下墓穴，但随着时间的推移，地图已经丢失或更新不及时，挖墓人发现自己撞到了不应该有的棺材的木头上，或者翻滚着进入了被遗忘的隧道，这并不罕见。强盗和迷恋死灵的米尔库尔（Myrkul）的追随者猖獗的盗墓行为只会加剧混乱，因为尸体被挖出并重新埋在方便的地方。最重要的是，几十年前的一次重大山体滑坡使墓地的大部分悬崖掉进了下面的河里，导致剩余的骨屋和标记物移位和倾斜，同时也使许多墓穴和墓道暴露在空气中，引发了新的盗墓潮。尽管鲍杜尔人很少用贵重物品埋葬死者，而且许多容易采摘的东西都被人拿走了，但人们普遍认为，过去几个世纪的一些最伟大的宝藏仍然与他们的英雄们躺在一起，他们的墓碑被风和雨无名地擦拭干净。",
	"This combined chapel and asylum in the Twin Songs neighborhood has long offered sanctuary for the depressed and mentally ill. The few attendants ascribe to the faith of no particular god, but extol the virtues of meditation and whatever calm faiths visitors might bring with them.": "这个位于双子星社区的综合教堂和庇护所长期以来一直为抑郁症和精神病人提供庇护。为数不多的服务员不信奉任何特定的神，而是颂扬冥想的美德，以及访客可能带来的任何平静的信仰。",
	"While Danthelon may never have been a real adventurer, he loves associating with them, and constantly keeps his ears open for rumors and opportunities, which he happily passes along to paying customers. At the moment, he's obsessed with reports of a group of smugglers who recently went missing in the Riverveins tunnels along with a chest full of valuable magic potions, and eagerly encourages his shoppers to investigate—and then return to tell him the story.": "虽然丹特伦可能从来都不是一个真正的冒险家，但他喜欢与他们交往，并不断地听着谣言和机会，他很乐意将这些谣言和机会传递给付费的顾客。目前，他对一群走私者的报告非常着迷，这些走私者最近在河湾区的隧道里失踪，同时还有一个装满珍贵魔法药水的箱子，他热切地鼓励他的顾客去调查，然后回来告诉他这个故事。",
	"As horses and other beasts of burden aren't allowed inside the city walls, the Outer City overflows with stables and hostlers, ranging from muddy pens to barns nicer than most inns. Of these, the largest is Garynmor Stables, which offers the unique benefit of operating locations in both Stonyeyes and Blackgate; those travelers passing through have the option of leaving their beasts on one side of the city and picking them up on the other, after grooms have ferried them around the outside of the walls. The stables are also unusual in their willingness to rent mounts to city residents in need of transportation, cutting down on the need of city dwellers to own their own horses. Yet the true gem setting Garynmor Stables apart is its menagerie.": "由于马匹和其他牲畜不允许进入城墙，外城充斥着马厩和主人，从泥泞的围栏到比大多数旅馆更漂亮的谷仓。其中，最大的马厩是加里莫尔马厩，它有一个独特的好处，就是在石门和黑门都有经营地点；那些路过的旅客可以选择把他们的牲口留在城市的一边，在马夫把它们送到城墙外后，再到另一边去接它们。马厩也很特别，他们愿意把坐骑租给需要交通工具的城市居民，减少了城市居民对自己马匹的需求。然而，使加里莫尔马厩与众不同的真正宝藏是它的动物群。",
	"This huge complex of pens, barns, and abattoirs is the largest slaughterhouse and knackery in Baldur's Gate. Located in the Stonyeyes neighborhood so as to be convenient to the city's butchers, the facility has a generally adversarial relationship with neighboring establishments, as other herders and hostlers claim the omnipresent smell of blood makes their animals nervous. Yet it's the citizens themselves who should be nervous, for the slaughterhouse recently came under new management.": "这座由围栏、谷仓和屠宰场组成的巨大建筑群是博德之门最大的屠宰场和加工厂。为了方便城市的屠夫，该设施位于Stoneyes附近，与附近的机构有着普遍的敌对关系，因为其他牧民和主人声称无处不在的血腥味让他们的动物紧张。然而，应该紧张的是市民自己，因为屠宰场最近有了新的管理。",
	"Seeking to spread fear and chaos, cultists of the Dead Three have infiltrated the slaughterhouse and begun murdering people across the city, leaving the victims in an alley behind the Smilin' Boar in Bloomridge. To further fan the flames, the cult slices the corpses across the wrists and inflicts a heart-piercing wound, giving rise to rumors that the murders are the result of a supernaturally deadly serial killer.": "为了散播恐惧和混乱，\"死亡三人组 \"的邪教分子潜入屠宰场，开始在全市范围内杀人，并将受害者留在布卢姆里奇的 \"微笑野猪 \"后面的一条小巷中。为了进一步煽风点火，该邪教组织将尸体的手腕切开，并造成穿心的伤口，从而引起了关于这些谋杀案是一个超自然的致命连环杀手所为的传言。",
	"Pasque Enrial, a {@creature black gauntlet of Bane|BGDIA}, is the cult's mastermind. He engineered the death of the slaughterhouse's former owner so that he could take over, figuring that constant blood, offal, and animal screams would provide a suitable cover for the cult's murderous activities. Since then, he's been slowly laying off existing workers and replacing them with cultists loyal to the group's mission. Assisting him are Corian Khee, a {@creature death's head of Bhaal|BGDIA} who spends days crushing livestock skulls with a massive hammer and nights leading the cult's murderous field operations, and Jaemus Exheltarion, a half-elf {@creature master of souls|BGDIA}. Of the three, Jaemus is the least convincing in his role as the slaughterhouse's new accountant, as he greets customers with an eerie stare, openly reads strange-looking tomes, and spends entirely too much time in the cult's trophy locker, a cold-storage facility where he's using pieces harvested from victims and livestock to construct a ram-headed flesh golem.": "帕斯克-恩里亚尔（Pasque Enrial），是这个邪教的主谋。他策划了屠宰场前老板的死亡，这样他就可以接管屠宰场，他认为不断的血液、内脏和动物的尖叫声可以为邪教的谋杀活动提供合适的掩护。从那时起，他就开始慢慢地裁减现有的工人，用忠于该组织使命的邪教人员来取代他们。协助他的是科里安-奇（Corian Khee），他是一个（1%），白天用巨大的锤子敲碎牲畜的头骨，晚上领导邪教的谋杀行动，还有一个半精灵（2%）杰姆斯-埃克塞塔伦（Jaemus Exheltarion）。在这三个人中，Jaemus作为屠宰场的新会计是最没有说服力的，因为他用阴森的目光迎接顾客，公开阅读奇怪的书籍，并且在邪教的战利品柜里花了太多的时间，这是一个冷库，他用从受害者和牲畜身上获得的碎片来建造一个公羊头的肉身雕像。",
	"Generations ago, a fleet of Calishite refugees fleeing war in the south came sailing into Gray Harbor. Rather than opening their doors to the foreigners, the people of Baldur's Gate quickly hustled them out of the city, forcing them out the Basilisk Gate in the middle of the night and taxing them for the privilege. Desperate and weary, the refugees finally found succor in a caravanserai run by a fellow Calishite in the Outer City. There they used what little wealth they'd been able to bring with them to construct a new home—a traditional Calishite settlement that would be precisely as friendly to Baldur's Gate as the Baldurians had been to them.": "几百年前，一支逃离南方战争的卡利希特难民船队驶入灰港。博德之门的人没有向这些外国人敞开大门，而是迅速将他们赶出了城市，强迫他们在半夜从Basilisk门出去，并为此向他们征税。在绝望和疲惫中，难民们终于在外城一个由卡利希特人经营的商队里找到了救助。在那里，他们用带来的一点财富建造了一个新的家园--一个传统的喀里希特人定居点，这个定居点对博德门的友好程度恰如博德人对他们的友好程度。",
	"Though much time has passed since that ignominious beginning, tensions remain high between Little Calimshan and the rest of the city, particularly with regard to those Baldurians living in the city proper. Unlike most of the Outer City, where neighborhoods blend into each other and no one can quite say where one ends and another begins, Little Calimshan is sharply defined by brick-and-plaster walls, 15 feet tall, 5 feet thick, and topped with minarets in the classic Calishite style. These walls don't simply surround the neighborhood, either. Little Calimshan is built like a traditional Calishite city in miniature, with its interior divided into multiple drudachs (neighborhoods). Each drudach is walled off and inhabited by a particular family or tribe, with its own religious site, inn or tavern, marketplace, and places of industry such as smithies, armories, tanneries, or mills. While such an abundance of walls might make Little Calimshan seem fractious and standoffish, in fact the opposite is true: the thick wall walks act as elevated streets, with locals able to look out over the layout from above and easily pick a path to their intended destination.": "虽然从那个可耻的开始到现在已经过去了很长时间，但小卡里姆山和城市其他地方之间的关系仍然很紧张，特别是那些住在城市里的鲍杜里人。与外城的大部分地区不同，那里的居民区相互融合，没有人能够说清楚哪里是结束，哪里是开始，而小卡里姆山则被砖墙和石膏墙清晰地界定，15英尺高，5英尺厚，上面有经典卡里什特风格的尖塔。这些墙也不是简单地围绕着这个社区。小卡利姆山的建造就像一个传统的卡利什特城市的缩影，其内部被划分为多个drudachs（街区）。每个街区都有围墙，由一个特定的家庭或部落居住，有自己的宗教场所、旅馆或酒馆、市场和工业场所，如铁匠铺、军械库、制革厂或磨坊。虽然如此多的墙壁可能会使小卡里姆山看起来分崩离析、冷冷清清，但事实上却恰恰相反：厚厚的墙面就像高架街道一样，当地人可以从上面俯瞰整个布局，轻松挑选出一条通往预定目的地的道路。",
	"Among Little Calimshan's most notorious locations is the Calim Jewel Emporium, widely regarded as the best jeweler in the city—and the best place to fence stolen gems, as it's also the local Guild headquarters. In addition to hosting regular public forums in her shop, Rael tacitly oversees the Garden of Whispers, a maze of wood-and-paper screens where people from across the city can buy and sell secrets with Guild agents and each other, speaking through the barriers so as to maintain anonymity. Also popular are schools like the Lamp of Learning and the Verdashir Academy (also known as the Dervish Academy), which train spellcasters and warriors in the styles of their ancestral homeland, allowing only the most talented outsiders to access their archives or join in their lessons. And, of course, every patriar in the city has visited the famous Oasis Theater, home of the city's most daring—and sometimes dangerous—productions.": "在小卡林山最臭名昭著的地点中，卡林珠宝店被广泛认为是该市最好的珠宝商，也是销赃的最佳场所，因为它也是当地行会的总部。除了在她的店里定期举办公共论坛外，雷尔还默默地监督着 \"私语花园\"，这是一个由木头和纸质屏幕组成的迷宫，来自整个城市的人们可以在这里与公会代理人和彼此之间买卖秘密，通过屏障说话，以保持匿名。同样受欢迎的还有像学习之灯和维达希尔学院（也被称为Dervish学院）这样的学校，它们以其祖国的风格训练法术师和战士，只允许最有天赋的外来者访问他们的档案或加入他们的课程。当然，这个城市的每一位元老都参观过著名的绿洲剧院，这里有这个城市最大胆的--有时是最危险的--作品。",
	"Even lowbrow theatergoers unable to decipher Goodnight's artistic genius can appreciate his flagrant breaking of taboos, with risqué burlesque and satirical scripts mocking everyone from the dukes to {@creature Nine-Fingers Keene|BGDIA} herself. The fact that these performances sometimes go terribly awry, with monsters breaking loose or a broken piece of equipment sending a performer plummeting into the crowd, only adds to the excitement, and patriars and common folk alike vie for seats at the theater's afternoon-only performances. Ticket prices are decided capriciously and on the spot by Goodnight, varying wildly between any given individual.": "即使是无法解读古德奈特的艺术天才的低级戏剧观众，也能欣赏到他对禁忌的公然打破，用冒失的滑稽剧和讽刺性的剧本嘲弄从公爵到（%）她自己的所有人。事实上，这些表演有时会出现可怕的失误，怪物失控或设备损坏使表演者坠落到人群中，这只会让人更加兴奋，爱国者和普通人都在争夺剧院下午演出的座位。票价是由晚安当场决定的，在任何一个人之间都有很大的差异。",
	"While Goodnight is always looking for new performers, at the moment he needs more than just a talented bard or contortionist. The cost of putting on his outrageous shows has landed him deep in debt, and his compulsive need to roast every potential patron or ally in the city hasn't helped matters. With the Guild ready to step in and assume ownership if he doesn't start repaying his loans, he needs to either turn to outright crime or put on a show more amazing than anything he's done before. He's got an idea, but to pull it off, he'll need an experienced adventuring party willing to play the stars in the world's first live-audience adventure.": "虽然晚安一直在寻找新的表演者，但目前他需要的不仅仅是一个有天赋的吟游诗人或柔术师。举办他那令人发指的演出的费用使他深陷债务之中，而他强迫性地需要烤掉城市中每一个潜在的赞助人或盟友，这对事情没有帮助。如果他不开始偿还贷款，行会准备介入并接管所有权，他需要要么转向直接的犯罪，要么上演一场比他以前做的任何事情都更惊人的表演。他有一个想法，但为了实现这个想法，他需要一个有经验的冒险团队，愿意在世界第一个现场观众的冒险中扮演明星。",
	"Just east of the city, where Dusthawk Hill rises along the Chionthar River, eddies captured by outcroppings have bored into the stone, carving a maze of meandering tunnels and draining into subterranean aquifers. Though hardly diverting enough water to impact the river's flow, the web of submerged chambers has become a source of mystery and legend for locals.": "就在城市的东部，尘鹰山沿着奇安塔尔河升起的地方，被突起物捕获的漩涡钻进了石头里，雕刻出一个蜿蜒的隧道迷宫，并排入地下含水层。虽然几乎没有转移足够的水来影响河水的流动，但这一网状的潜水室已成为当地人神秘和传奇的来源。",
	"In a city often thought to be dour and dangerous, the Whitkeep Hostel is a spark of light and levity. Built by a wealthy caravan operator who lost their fortune to monster attacks, this white-walled manor house was quickly overtaken by squatters, and has now spent most of a century as an all-gnome artist's commune. Though only gnomes are invited to rent one of the rambling manor's thirty-seven studio apartments, Baldurians of all races are welcome to socialize at the place's infamous surrealist parties or attend its concerts and offbeat art happenings. As such, the hostel has become the central gathering point for the city's radicals and revolutionaries, as well as many artists and dreamers.": "在这个经常被认为是沉闷和危险的城市，白守旅馆是一个光明和轻松的火花。这座白墙的庄园是由一个富有的大篷车经营者建造的，他们因为怪物的攻击而失去了财富，很快就被棚户区居民所占领，现在已经度过了一个世纪的大部分时间，成为一个全地精艺术家的公社。尽管只有地精被邀请租用这个漫无边际的庄园的37个单间公寓之一，但所有种族的Baldurians都欢迎在这个地方的臭名昭著的超现实主义派对上进行社交活动，或参加其音乐会和非主流艺术活动。因此，该旅馆已成为该市激进分子和革命者，以及许多艺术家和梦想家的中心聚集点。",
	"This neighborhood is actually two enormous bridges, each spanning half the Chionthar River and meeting at Wyrm's Rock, a tall, rocky islet in the center. While the Flaming Fist maintains a fortress on the island to tax travelers along the Coast Way and control city access in times of trouble, the bridges themselves are fair game for squatters. Ramshackle wooden tenements, taverns, and shops crowd both sides of the arched stone spans, leaning out over the narrow road between them. Even more cling to the sides of the bridges, anchored to each other or cantilevered over the water. The tendency of these latter structures to occasionally drop into the rushing river, pulling their neighbors down with them, is not enough to deter residents who hope to be the first to sell to travelers on their way into the city, or the last to pick their pockets on the way out.": "这个街区实际上是两座巨大的桥，每座桥都横跨半条基昂萨尔河，在中心的高大岩石小岛Wyrm's Rock相遇。虽然火焰之拳在岛上保留了一个堡垒，以便对海岸线上的旅行者征税，并在遇到麻烦时控制城市交通，但这些桥本身对非法移民来说是公平的。破旧的木制公寓、酒馆和商店挤满了拱形石桥的两边，靠在它们之间的狭窄道路上。更多的人依附在桥的两侧，相互固定在一起，或者悬臂在水面上。后面的这些建筑偶尔会掉进奔腾的河水中，把它们的邻居也拉下去，但这并不足以阻止那些希望在旅行者进城时第一个向他们推销，或在出城时最后一个掏他们口袋的居民。",
	"Even among members of the Outer City, residents of Wyrm's Crossing have a reputation as rakes and riffraff, and the neighborhood specializes in seedy dive bars and gambling halls where belligerent drunks can be ejected directly out over the river. At the same time, it also has a large and tight-knit strongheart halfling community, whose low-ceilinged tenements and lighter weight are perfect for the neighborhood's precarious architectural style.": "即使在外城的成员中，Wyrm's Crossing的居民也有耙子和流氓的名声，这个街区专门有肮脏的潜水酒吧和赌博厅，好斗的醉汉可以直接被赶到河边。同时，这里也有一个庞大而紧密的强心半身人社区，他们的低矮公寓和较轻的体重非常适合该地区不稳定的建筑风格。",
	"While the Crossing is renowned for cheats and criminals, the residents stick together, and a local crew called the Crossers ensures that all predatory practices are applied primarily to travelers, and never to fellow bridge-dwellers. For those who consistently refuse to play well with their neighbors, the answer is often Sweetjen's Spices, a precarious bridge-side shop whose halfling proprietor quietly sells some of the most potent drugs and untraceable poisons in the city.": "虽然十字路口以骗子和罪犯而闻名，但居民们团结一致，一个名为十字路口的当地团队确保所有掠夺性行为主要适用于旅行者，而不是桥上的同伴。对于那些始终拒绝与邻居打好关系的人，答案往往是Sweetjen's Spices，这是一家不稳定的桥边商店，其半身人老板悄悄地出售一些城市中最有效的药物和无法追踪的毒药。",
	"This formidable fortress rises from the center of the river on an algae-slick islet, its sheer walls nearly impossible to scale. Built by the Flaming Fist on a rock once said to have housed a bronze dragon, the fortress is the first checkpoint at which Baldur's Gate taxes northbound travelers. Anyone seeking to cross the river via the fortress's two massive bridges must pay the 5 cp toll and pass through the fortress via a long central tunnel riddled with arrow slits and murder holes. Between twenty-five and fifty Flaming Fist soldiers staff the checkpoint, which operates only during the day. After dark, the drawbridges on either side of the keep are raised, halting all traffic and forcing latecomers to take shelter at one of the many bridge-top inns in Wyrm's Crossing until morning.": "这座可怕的堡垒从河中心的一个海藻粘稠的小岛上升起，其陡峭的墙壁几乎无法攀登。堡垒由火焰之拳建造在一块据说曾容纳过一条青铜龙的岩石上，是博德之门向北行旅客征税的第一个检查站。任何想通过要塞的两座巨桥过河的人都必须支付5cp的过路费，并通过一条长长的、布满箭缝和杀人孔的中央隧道通过要塞。25到50名火焰之拳的士兵在检查站工作，只在白天运作。天黑后，堡垒两边的吊桥会升起，停止所有的交通，迫使迟到的人在巫师之路众多的桥头旅馆中躲避，直到天亮。",
	"The fortress has four levels: the bridge level, taken up by the gauntlet tunnel and offices devoted to traffic management; a second-story armory full of oil, javelins, and everything the soldiers need to withstand a siege; a third story for soldier's quarters; and a high-ceilinged dungeon level below the bridges to hold temporary prisoners and the fortress's supply of small boats (should the garrison need to sally through heavily fortified river-level gates). Soldiers stationed in the fortress tend to fall into two categories: those disappointed at being stuck on toll-collection duty so far from the city, and those overjoyed at easy work and a chance to carouse in Wyrm's Crossing, with the latter ensuring that the Fist doesn't patrol their neighboring bridges too heavily.": "堡垒有四层：桥梁层，由铠甲隧道和专门负责交通管理的办公室占据；第二层是军械库，里面装满了石油、标枪和士兵们需要的所有东西，以抵御围攻；第三层是士兵的宿舍；桥梁下面有一个天花板很高的地牢，用来关押临时囚犯和堡垒的小船供应（如果驻军需要通过戒备森严的河岸闸门进行偷袭）。驻扎在要塞的士兵往往分为两类：一类是对远离城市的收费任务感到失望，另一类是对轻松的工作和在Wyrm's Crossing狂欢的机会感到高兴，后者确保拳头公司不会对邻近的桥梁进行过多的巡逻。",
	"The commander of Wyrm's Rock, an old brute named Skorpin Crane, died in his sleep recently. Foul play was ruled out, and Grand Duke {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} was in the midst of finding Crane's replacement when he was lured away on a diplomatic mission to Elturel. Until a replacement is found, the Mage Defender of Wyrm's Rock, a neutral evil shield dwarf {@creature mage} named Gardak Horn, has taken command. The guards loathe Gardak because he uses a {@creature homunculus} to spy on them.": "Wyrm's Rock的指挥官，一个名叫Skorpin Crane的老畜生，最近在睡梦中死去。大公爵{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}被排除了犯规的可能性，他正在寻找克雷恩的替代者，但他被引诱到Elturel去执行外交任务了。在找到替代者之前，巫妖石的法师卫士，一个名叫加达克-霍恩的中立邪恶的盾牌矮人（%%），已经开始指挥。守卫们厌恶加达克，因为他用一个{@creature homunculus}来监视他们。",

	"This material is meant to be a tool for you, the DM. Once players have decided on their characters' backgrounds, review the material here. Some backgrounds have at least one new variant feature that ties the background to a group in Baldur's Gate, provided to give characters an additional connection to the city. Characters may choose to replace the standard feature of their background with one of these variant features. Each background also includes a bonus feature that marks a character as a native of Baldur's Gate who's familiar with the city—both its streets and its scars. These additional features are referred to as \"Baldur's Gate features.\" While a character's background features are broadly useful, the effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate. These location-based features do not replace other features; a character gains them merely for being familiar with Baldur's Gate. If a background presents multiple Baldur's Gate features, you gain all the features associated with that background, or as many of them as you wish to take.": "这些材料旨在为你--DM提供一个工具。一旦玩家决定了他们的角色的背景，请回顾这里的材料。有些背景至少有一个新的变体特征，将背景与博德之门中的某个团体联系起来，为角色提供了与城市的额外联系。角色可以选择用这些变异特征之一来取代其背景的标准特征。每个背景还包括一个额外的特征，标志着一个角色是博德之门的本地人，他熟悉这个城市--包括它的街道和它的伤痕。这些额外的特征被称为 \"博德之门特征\"。虽然角色的背景特征广泛有用，但博德之门特征的效果只能在角色处于博德之门时使用--尽管由DM决定，它们可能在与博德之门类似的情况下有适用的效果。这些基于地点的特征并不取代其他特征；一个角色仅仅因为熟悉博德之门而获得这些特征。如果一个背景呈现出多个博德之门的特征，你就会获得与该背景相关的所有特征，或者你想获得多少就有多少。",

	"A devil's ultimate goal is to claim mortal souls.

	"Despite their thirst for trapping mortal souls in binding contracts, devils can enter into deals only in specific circumstances. The easiest way for a devil to forge a deal is to do so within the Nine Hells, where it's closer to the infernal hierarchy and can more easily channel its power. Elsewhere in the multiverse, most devils are too removed from their power structure to enter into binding deals without some extraordinary circumstances.": "尽管他们渴望将凡人的灵魂困在有约束力的合同中，但魔鬼只有在特定情况下才能达成交易。魔鬼达成交易的最简单方法是在九层地狱内进行，在那里它更接近地狱的等级制度，可以更容易地引导其力量。在多元宇宙的其他地方，大多数魔鬼都与它们的权力结构相距甚远，如果没有一些特殊情况，就无法达成有约束力的交易。",

	"An archdevil who wishes to make a deal with a character can do so in person or send a minion to propose the deal and negotiate on its behalf. A character can also contact an archdevil by killing a chaotic- or good-aligned humanoid and praying to the archdevil over the course of 1 hour. The archdevil hears the character's prayer and can choose to respond in dreams or visions, or it can send a minion with the authority to make a deal on its behalf.": "希望与角色达成交易的大恶魔可以亲自去做，也可以派一个奴仆去提出交易并代表它进行谈判。一个角色也可以通过杀死一个混沌或善良的人形生物并在1小时内向大恶魔祈祷来联系大恶魔。大恶魔听到了角色的祈祷，并可以选择在梦境或幻觉中做出回应，或者它可以派出一个有权力代表它进行交易的爪牙。",

Not every deal is meant to be.": "邪恶的交易开始于魔鬼或人物提出的主题和提供的东西。交易的条件至少要求魔鬼提供一份礼物，人物同意一个价格。如果条件不被任何一方接受，他们可以进行谈判，试图通过提供更有价值的条件来增加交易的甜头，或者干脆离开。不是每一笔交易都是注定的。",

	"Most deals with devils can be resolved without rolling dice to determine the outcome. A Charisma check can't deceive or persuade most devils into a bad deal because the fiends are too clever and experienced in deal-making to be fooled. If devils do get involved in a deal that sounds too good to be true or is confusing, they're likely to pause negotiations while they ask smarter devils for their opinions on the deal.": "大多数与魔鬼的交易可以不通过掷骰子来决定结果。魅力检查不能欺骗或说服大多数魔鬼进行糟糕的交易，因为这些魔鬼太聪明了，在交易方面也很有经验，不会被愚弄。如果魔鬼确实卷入了一个听起来好得不像真的或令人困惑的交易，他们很可能会暂停谈判，同时向更聪明的魔鬼询问他们对交易的意见。",
	"The following ability checks can be made during deal-making:": "在交易过程中可以进行以下能力检查。",
	"A devil wants souls, as every soul that it acquires brings the devil one step closer to its next promotion. If a character wants something from a devil but isn't willing to trade their soul, the devil might ask the character to perform a service for it instead. Archdevils are also fond of making mortals swear fealty to them.": "魔鬼想要灵魂，因为它获得的每一个灵魂都会使魔鬼离它的下一次晋升更近一步。如果一个角色想从魔鬼那里得到什么，但不愿意用他们的灵魂来交换，魔鬼可能会要求这个角色为它提供服务。大恶魔也喜欢让凡人向他们宣誓效忠。",

	"A devil that can't claim a character's soul might demand a service by way of compensation. Such services drive the character toward committing evil or morally questionable acts designed to make the character more amenable to darker deals in the future. Here are a few examples:": "一个不能索取角色灵魂的魔鬼可能会以补偿的方式要求提供服务。这种服务会促使角色犯下邪恶或道德上有问题的行为，以使角色在未来更容易接受更黑暗的交易。这里有几个例子。",
	"Without using magical coercion, the character must convince another mortal to enter into an infernal contract with the devil.": "在不使用魔法胁迫的情况下，该角色必须说服另一个凡人与魔鬼签订无间契约。",

	"Archdevils prize fealty almost as much as souls. One way in which a mortal can demonstrate fealty to an archdevil is to lead a religious cult devoted to the archdevil or perform heinous acts in the archdevil's name. A character can also enter into an agreement to serve the archdevil as a warlock. Such a character must take at least one level in the warlock class, choosing {@class Warlock||the Fiend|Fiend} (represented in this case by the archdevil) as their otherworldly patron.": "大恶魔几乎和灵魂一样看重忠诚。凡人对大恶魔表示忠诚的一种方式是领导一个致力于大恶魔的宗教崇拜，或以大恶魔的名义进行令人发指的行为。一个角色也可以签订协议，作为术士为大恶魔服务。这样的角色必须在术士等级中至少提升一个等级，选择{@class Warlock||the Fiend|Fiend}（在这种情况下由大恶魔代表）作为他们的异世界守护者。",

	"Contracts take a variety of forms, with the terms of the deal written out in Infernal, and are made binding in one of several ways, ranging from a simple signature to a revolting act.

	"In some ways, Zariel is a jewel in Asmodeus's crown—a former angel, now an archdevil, in his infernal service. Given her origin, Zariel has more than the normal share of devils plotting to overthrow her, the first among them being the pit fiend {@creature Bel|BGDIA}, whom she displaced. By Asmodeus's decree, {@creature Bel|BGDIA} now serves Zariel as an advisor, though the two can barely stand to be in each other's presence.": "在某种程度上，扎瑞尔(Zariel)是阿斯莫迪斯(Asmodeus)王冠上的一颗明珠——她曾是一位天使，如今是他地狱服务中的一位大恶魔。由于她的出身，扎瑞尔拥有比正常恶魔更多的策划推翻她的敌人，其中首要的是炼狱恶魔{@creature Bel|BGDIA}，她曾取代了他的地位。根据阿斯莫迪斯的命令，{@creature Bel|BGDIA}现在作为扎瑞尔的顾问，尽管两者几乎无法忍受彼此的存在。",

	"Archdevils can eavesdrop on communication spells such as {@spell message} and {@spell sending} sent from or within the Nine Hells.

At the same time, the character falls under the effect of a {@spell geas} spell (no saving throw allowed). If this spell ends prematurely, the character immediately drops to 0 hit points and is dying. The task that the character must complete is usually simple and straightforward, and always for the benefit of the archdevil who struck the deal.

	"One way to run a complex social encounter like this one is to imagine a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 representing the worst possible outcome and 10 the best. The characters start at 5, and as they progress through the scene, they may move up or down the scale. Positive and helpful interactions move them up the scale, and antagonistic or unfriendly exchanges lose them points, as you determine. Where they end determines the consequences of the encounter. For example, if the characters end at a 10 on the scale, they get everything they want from {@creature Mad Maggie|BGDIA}: one or more vehicles to expedite travel across Avernus, all the information they need, monetary or magical gifts, and provisions. If they end at a 1 on the scale, they anger {@creature Mad Maggie|BGDIA} and get nothing. They might even have to fight their way out of Fort Knucklebone. As long as the characters still have a path forward, a spectacular failure can be just as memorable as success.": "在处理这样的复杂社交场景时，一种方法是想象一个从1到10的刻度，1代表最糟糕的结果，10代表最好的结果。角色从5开始，随着场景的发展，他们可能会在刻度上上下移动。积极和有帮助的互动会让他们上升，而对抗性或不友好的交流会让他们失去分数，由你来决定。他们最终停留在刻度上决定了这次交流的后果。例如，如果角色最终停留在刻度的10，他们将从{@creature Mad Maggie|BGDIA}那里得到他们想要的一切：一个或多个车辆以加快穿越阿弗尼斯的速度，所有他们需要的信息，金钱或魔法礼物，以及补给品。如果他们最终停留在刻度的1，他们会惹怒{@creature Mad Maggie|BGDIA}并一无所获。他们甚至可能不得不与钢铁之骨堡搏斗。只要角色仍然有前进的道路，壮丽的失败和成功一样令人难忘。",

Once the glabrezu has taken three turns, Bazelsteen returns and scares the demon away if it hasn't been defeated by then.

	"Of course, guests leaving Infernal Rapture are expected to pay their bills in full prior to departure. If a guest cannot pay for whatever reason, the contract they signed on entry clearly stipulates their soul is forfeit. They're required to pay off their debt through service. All such individuals fall under the effect of a {@spell geas} cast as a 9th-level spell, which cannot be willingly broken by the affected individual until their debt is paid in full. What Mahadi does with such defaulters depends on their capabilities. Some become indentured servants, working at Infernal Rapture. If they possess a talent for sales, they might eventually obtain a business to run within the Wandering Emporium.": "当然，离开地狱狂喜酒店的客人在离开之前应当全额支付账单。如果客人因任何原因无法支付，他们在入住时签署的合同清楚规定了他们的灵魂将被没收。他们需要通过服务来偿还债务。所有这些个体都受到{@spell geas}作为第9级法术的影响，受影响的个体在债务全额偿还之前无法自愿解除。Mahadi对这些拖欠者的处理取决于他们的能力。有些人成为契约奴隶，在地狱狂喜酒店工作。如果他们擅长销售，他们可能最终会在流浪集市内经营一家企业。",

All such deals must be presented to the other party without alteration, and they are not negotiable. In all such agreements, Asmodeus wants one thing only: a character signing one of these contracts gives up their soul forever. After the signing character reaches 17th level, if at any point they die, their death is permanent, with no chance to return from the grave. Asmodeus takes their soul and makes them a {@creature pit fiend}, in his service for eternity.": "马哈迪有权力根据阿斯莫迪斯的指示和授权，就像他是一名大恶魔一样进行交易（见{@adventure appendix A|BGDIA|10}）。所有这类交易必须原样呈现给对方，且不可谈判。在所有这类协议中，阿斯莫迪斯只想要一件事：签署这些合同的角色永远放弃他们的灵魂。在签署角色达到17级后，如果他们在任何时候死亡，他们的死亡是永久的，没有机会从坟墓中返回。阿斯莫迪斯夺走他们的灵魂，并让他们成为{@creature pit fiend}, 为他效劳直到永远。",

	"Specialty services include dream therapy, whole body restoration, and longevity therapy, as well as a host of services for every appetite, both wholesome and degenerate.

As soon as mid-afternoon arrives, however, shoppers are shuffled back out the arched gates, and the only non-Calishites still allowed within the neighborhood are those who've married into a Little Calimshan family or otherwise earned the sacred trust of a drudach's residents. While many residents of Little Calimshan venture into the larger city for business or pleasure, not even the Flaming Fist is able to force its way into the neighborhood-turned-fortress after hours except in the direst circumstances, and each drudach is instead patrolled by a militia of young unmarried warriors ({@creature Guard||guards} with scimitars instead of spears) called amlakkars.": "仅次于繁华热闹的广场，小卡利姆山在市场上也别具风情，每天仅向外人开放几个小时。在其错综复杂的集市中，当地商人凭借与各种商队的独家贸易协议，几乎垄断了许多南方进口商品，从卡利姆钢的绸缎和精美刀剑到稀有魔法传说的书籍。然而，一旦午后到来，购物者便被赶出拱门，唯一仍被允许留在社区内的非卡利姆人是那些嫁入小卡利姆山家庭或以其他方式赢得了德鲁达奇居民神圣信任的人。虽然许多小卡利姆山居民会进入更大的城市进行商务或休闲活动，但即使是火焰拳也无法在非营业时间闯入这个变成堡垒的社区，除非在极端情况下，而每个德鲁达奇则由一支年轻未婚战士组成（{@creature Guard||guards}手持弯刀而非长矛）的民兵巡逻。",
