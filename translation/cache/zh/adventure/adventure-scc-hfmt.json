Will the characters unveil and thwart the threats before something terrible befalls the event?": "在这次冒险中，人物以二年级学生的身份回到了Strixhaven大学。随着新学年的开始，人物的同龄人敦促他们组成一个团队，参加一场备受瞩目的法师塔游戏。他们将调查游戏中心的魔法生物的奇怪行为，同时为大比赛做准备。而在这一年中，邪恶的力量在校园里造成了巨大的破坏--直到人物在Strixhaven体育场的决定性比赛日为止。在可怕的事情发生之前，这些人物能否揭开并挫败这些威胁？",

	"Once the announcement ends, the teams are required to move from the locker rooms onto the main field. When both teams meet Professor Sharpbeak at the center of the field, Professor Sharpbeak snags the characters' mascot, flies it to the southern end of the field, and places it there. She then flies the opposing team's mascot to the field's north end.": "宣布结束后，各队被要求从更衣室移到主场。当两队在球场中心与夏普比克教授相遇时，夏普比克教授会抓住角色的吉祥物，把它飞到球场的南端，并把它放在那里。然后她将对方的吉祥物飞到球场的北端。",

	"Examining the mage hunters reveals that these are the creatures that have been stalking the characters throughout this academic year. Their chitin matches the type the characters found near Wiltroot Hall, the Rose Stage, Aerojaunt Field, and the Scriptoria Collections. Characters who read the tome in the Scriptoria Collections, which mentioned that mage hunters work in pairs, should feel reassured that the threat has ended on Strixhaven's campus.": "对法师猎人的检查显示，这些是在整个学年中一直跟踪人物的生物。他们的甲壳素与人物在威尔特罗特大厅、玫瑰舞台、Aerojaunt场地和Scriptoria收藏馆附近发现的类型一致。读过剧本集的人应该会对法师猎人成双成对地工作感到放心，因为威胁已经在Strixhaven的校园里结束了。",

	"As he grows more proficient in his ability to siphon creatures' energy to power his magic, {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} is practicing lesser forms of the magic that will eventually culminate in his destructive ritual in {@adventure chapter 6|SCC-ARiR|0}. Evidence of his magic persists in {@adventure area W5|SCC-HfMT|0|W5. Southern Clearing}. The strange energy of his magic has drawn creatures to the area around Wiltroot Hall and made them unusually aggressive. Professor Sharpbeak's stray mascots have also been drawn to the area, though they are no more aggressive than usual.": "随着他在将生物能量转化为魔法能量的能力上变得更加娴熟，{@creature Murgaxor|SCC} 正在练习那些较小的魔法形式，最终将在{@adventure chapter 6|SCC-ARiR|0} 中达到毁灭性的仪式。 他魔法的证据仍然存在于{@adventure area W5|SCC-HfMT|0|W5. Southern Clearing}。 他魔法的奇特能量已经吸引了生物聚集在威尔特鲁特大厅周围，并使它们异常攻击性。 夏普喙教授的迷路吉祥物也被吸引到了这个区域，尽管它们并没有比平常更具攻击性。",

	"The cracked stone the pest is gnawing on is an {@item Ioun Stone, Awareness||Ioun stone (awareness)}. The stone is malfunctioning and was discarded here.

	"This clearing appears to be empty. However, a DC 13 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check reveals movement in the western part of the surrounding brush.

	"Once the ankhegs are dispatched, the characters see an {@creature inkling mascot|SCC} (see {@book chapter 7|SCC|8|Inkling Mascot}) poke its head out from the underbrush nearby.

	"If the characters approach the refuse, it reveals itself to be an aggressive {@creature black pudding}.

	"If the characters approach the two lumps, a guttural gurgle emits from them in tandem. Rising to stand is a fungal, mossy beast that groans, \"Disturbed!
