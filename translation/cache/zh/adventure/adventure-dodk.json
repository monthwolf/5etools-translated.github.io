Each has pledged their swords and lives to rebuild Drakkenheim and restore the Realm of Westemär. Several noble houses have set aside their feuds to support the Hooded Lanterns' efforts.

	"The Queen's Men are a loose affiliation between a hundred gangs of brigands, outlaws, and scoundrels, all of whom owe fealty to the enigmatic {@creature Queen of Thieves|DoDk}.

	"The Knights of the Silver Order are an organization of oath-bound paladins and devout warriors sworn to combat supernatural evil, dark magic, and otherworldly incursions. The questing knights normally travel the realms in small bands and companies, and adhere to the Faith of the Sacred Flame, the dominant religion across the continent. They believe delerium is a contaminating blight borne of the darkest chaos, and have resolved to annihilate the corrupted crystals, slay every monster it has created, and hunt down diabolical mages who would wield its power to work evil magic.

Even still, masses of devout commonfolk now embark on a dangerous pilgrimage to Drakkenheim to take their place in a divine plan.": "德拉肯海姆的毁灭引发了圣焰信仰内部严重的宗教分裂。一个名为落火信徒（Followers of the Falling Fire）的新教派出现了，他们信奉前圣焰守护者{@creature Lucretia Mathias|DoDk}的预言。她声称狂热石是一种神圣的礼物，而不是一种疾病，并且这些神圣的石头将在即将到来的更大黑暗中提供救赎。主流教士已经将卢克莲蒂亚·马西亚斯（Lucretia Mathias）逐出教门，并将她的追随者们定性为持有异端信仰和亵渎行为的疯狂邪教。尽管如此，大批虔诚的平民现在正在危险的朝圣之旅中前往德拉肯海姆，以在神圣计划中扮演自己的角色。",

	"Characters will also encounter deadly {@b eldritch contamination} caused by creatures, delerium, and other magical phenomena in Drakkenheim.

	"Every major event, location, and non-player character is detailed in this book, and we've included many more completely new ones for you to explore in your own game. In many ways, the original campaign was a playtest for this book, and we've refined and updated several sections since. If you've watched the original series and notice an inconsistency between this book and the show (there are many), the version in this book takes precedence. On the flipside, you should feel empowered to alter, change, and expand the material here, especially if doing so builds stronger connections or better stories for you and your players.": "这本书详细介绍了每一个重要事件、地点和非玩家角色，我们还为您提供了许多全新的内容供您在自己的游戏中探索。在很多方面，原始的战役是这本书的试玩版本，我们自那时起对几个部分进行了完善和更新。如果您观看了原始系列并注意到本书与节目之间的不一致之处（有很多），本书中的版本优先。另一方面，您应该有权修改、更改和扩展这里的材料，特别是如果这样做可以为您和您的玩家建立更强的联系或更好的故事。",
	"The events of our original campaign are non-canonical with regards to this book, so several elements of Drakkenheim strongly connected to the original characters have been altered or removed.

Running an exciting and dynamic nonlinear adventure requires sound judgement and good use of logic on your part.

Occasionally, you may even need to devise your own material or repurpose adventure hooks, characters, and locations to better suit the changing conditions in your campaign.": "这本书包含了灵感、指南和工具，帮助你裁决和回应玩家角色在探索德拉肯海姆时的行动。进行一场令人兴奋和动态的非线性冒险需要你具备明智的判断力和良好的逻辑运用。你应该有能力进行改动，让玩家们获得有益且具有挑战性的体验。偶尔，你甚至可能需要设计自己的材料或重新利用冒险钩子、角色和地点，以更好地适应你的战役中不断变化的情况。",
	"The characters arrive in Drakkenheim to pursue their personal quests or a few freelance missions from friendly contacts in Emberwood Village. They face ravenous {@creature Ratling|DoDk|ratlings}, malfeasant wizards, and rival adventurers in the Outer City Ruins. During their first forays into the city, the characters witness the strange magic of delerium and contend with the mysterious Haze. The threat of contamination makes survival in Drakkenheim difficult and dangerous. The characters may seek assistance and resources from the five factions to accomplish their goals and find a way deeper into the city.": "角色们抵达德拉肯海姆（Drakkenheim）追寻他们的个人任务，或从恩伯伍德村（Emberwood Village）友好联系人处接受一些自由职业任务。他们在外城废墟中面对饥饿的{@creature Ratling|DoDk|ratlings}、邪恶的巫师和竞争对手冒险者。在他们首次进入这座城市时，角色们目睹了癫狂魔法和神秘的薄雾，并与之抗衡。污染的威胁使得在德拉肯海姆生存变得困难且危险。角色们可以寻求五大派系的帮助和资源，以完成他们的目标并找到深入城市的方法。",
	"As the characters learn more about the factions' differing ideologies, the various faction leaders take notice of their progress. Once the characters successfully traverse the City Walls and begin exploring the Inner City Ruins, each leader approaches the characters for help with their objectives. They appeal to the characters' Ideals and Bonds, offer resources and support, and promise crucial assistance with the characters' personal quests.": "随着角色们对各派系不同意识形态的了解加深，各派系领袖们开始注意到他们的进展。一旦角色们成功穿越城墙，开始探索内城废墟，每位领袖都会接近角色们，寻求帮助实现他们的目标。他们会呼吁角色们的理想和羁绊，提供资源和支持，并承诺在角色们的个人任务中提供关键帮助。",
	"However, as the characters collaborate with the factions to advance their mutual goals, they become increasingly entangled in the political machinations between the competing groups. Each organization has a different vision for the future of Drakkenheim, and the tenuous peace won't last much longer. Nevertheless, with the support of one or more of these groups, the characters can explore dangerous Inner City locations such as the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio, the Inscrutable Tower of the Amethyst Academy, or perhaps even mount an expedition into the crater. Characters may unearth stunning revelations from Drakkenheim's past and recover powerful artifact which threaten the balance of power between the factions. They might even discover how the Haze threatens to engulf the world itself.": "然而，随着角色与派系合作以推动彼此的共同目标，他们越来越卷入竞争团体之间的政治阴谋中。每个组织对德拉肯海姆的未来有不同的愿景，脆弱的和平不会持续太久。然而，凭借这些团体中一个或多个的支持，角色可以探索危险的内城地点，如圣维特鲁维奥大教堂、紫晶学院的神秘塔楼，甚至可能发起一次进入火山口的探险。角色可能会发掘德拉肯海姆过去的惊人启示，并找回威胁派系之间力量平衡的强大神器。他们甚至可能发现雾霾如何威胁着吞噬整个世界。",
	"The factions are deeply divided over what must be done to solve these problems. As a result, simmering tensions boil over into outright conflict. As the city streets become a battlefield between the organizations, the faction leaders each demand the characters' loyalty. Now, the characters must decide which factions are their allies, and which are their enemies. Eventually, the unraveling situation may require the characters to act directly against one or more of the factions, who respond with counterstrikes of their own. In turn, the characters may launch major assaults against enemy factions to destroy their strongholds, defeat their leaders, and drive them out of Drakkenheim. As the conflict reaches its zenith, the surviving factions set their master plans into motion, requiring an expedition into Castle Drakken. There, a final showdown will decide the fate of Drakkenheim.": "各派别在解决这些问题上存在深刻分歧。结果，潜在的紧张局势演变成了公开冲突。随着城市街道成为各组织之间的战场，派别领袖们各自要求角色们的忠诚。现在，角色们必须决定哪些派别是他们的盟友，哪些是他们的敌人。最终，混乱的局势可能要求角色们直接对抗一个或多个派别，而这些派别则会做出自己的反击。接着，角色们可能对敌对派别发动重大攻击，摧毁他们的据点，击败他们的领袖，并将他们赶出德拉肯海姆。随着冲突达到顶峰，幸存的派别将启动他们的主计划，需要进行一次远征进入德拉肯城堡。在那里，最终的决战将决定德拉肯海姆的命运。",

	"Characters looking to revive a slain companion have limited options. Few non-player characters are capable of casting the necessary spells, and the expensive material components are rare. Prominent members of the Silver Order and the Followers of the Falling Fire can cast {@spell raise dead} and other higher level spells.

Characters might also seek out the druid of the Shrine of Morrigan (see {@area chapter 6|33c|x}).

	"Magic attracts more magic. Under extraordinarily rare circumstances, magical energies crystallize into delerium. The stones slowly draw more raw magic into the world from distant planes, possible realities, and alternate dimensions. The rate is exponential. Considerably more leakage occurs around vast quantities of delerium. These chaotic energies are inherently destabilizing. Unfocused magic conjures up paradoxical improbabilities at random, leaving behind lingering eldritch contamination. Uncontained, these magical forces manifest as the Haze. More delerium forms within, and so the process accelerates.": "魔法吸引更多的魔法。在极为罕见的情况下，魔法能量会结晶成狂乱石(`Delerium`)。这些石头会慢慢地从遥远的位面、可能的现实和替代维度中吸引更多原始魔法进入世界。这种速率是指数级的。在大量狂乱石周围会发生更多泄漏。这些混乱的能量本质上是不稳定的。无焦点的魔法会随机召唤出悖论的不可能性，留下持久的奥术污染。如果不加控制，这些魔法力量会表现为“薄雾”(`the Haze`)。更多狂乱石在其中形成，因此这个过程会加速。",
	"The meteor left behind vast deposits of delerium, enough to manifest an erratic magical field called the {@b Haze}. New delerium deposits gradually emerge within the Haze, which causes the affected region to expand slowly over time. Left unchecked, the Haze can overtake an entire world within a few centuries, leaving behind a chaotic landscape of churning madness and wild magic. The infected world cataclysmically shatters when more destructive magic inevitably erupts, sending a hail of delerium-filled comets throughout the cosmos. After hurtling through the Astral Void for eons, some collide with new worlds where the process begins again. Countless worlds have met this fate, the rest are wholly ignorant of the doom that might one day descend upon them.": "这颗陨石留下了大量的癫狂矿床，足以形成一个名为{@b Haze}的不稳定魔法领域。新的癫狂矿床会逐渐在“薄雾”中出现，导致受影响区域随着时间缓慢扩大。如果不加控制，这片“薄雾”可以在几个世纪内占领整个世界，留下一片翻腾的疯狂和狂野魔法的混乱景观。受感染的世界最终会在更具破坏性的魔法不可避免地爆发时，发生灾难性的破碎，将充满癫狂的彗星雨送往宇宙各地。在星空虚空中飞行了无数岁月后，一些彗星与新世界相撞，整个过程重新开始。无数世界已经遭遇了这样的命运，其余的世界完全不知道可能有一天会降临在它们身上的厄运。",
	"If nothing is done to stop the spread, the Haze will fully engulf Westemär in roughly one hundred and fifty years.

Civilization and society collapse into a monster-filled wasteland that catastrophically ruptures about one thousand years later.": "如果不采取任何措施阻止传播，(`Westemär`)将在大约一百五十年内完全被(`Haze`)所笼罩。一旦发生这种情况，几乎没有逆转的希望，恐怖的雾气将在两个世纪后笼罩整个世界。文明和社会将崩溃成一个充满怪物的荒地，在大约一千年后发生灾难性的破裂。",
	"None know the complete truth about the Haze at the outset of the campaign, and little knowledge is revealed via divination magic save mad whispers. Throughout the adventure, player characters may find clues about delerium from which they may develop their own theories and speculations regarding the origins of the meteor. They can learn much by exploring deep into the ruins, especially locations such as the Inscrutable Tower, the crater, and Castle Drakken. Faction leaders and malfeasant wizards might also offer their research and insights to help players along the way.": "在活动开始时，关于(`Haze`)的完整真相无人知晓，除了疯狂的耳语外，神秘魔法也很少透露知识。在冒险过程中，玩家角色可能会发现关于(`delerium`)的线索，从中他们可以发展自己关于流星起源的理论和推测。通过深入探索废墟，尤其是(`Inscrutable Tower`)、撞击坑和(`Castle Drakken`)等地点，他们可以学到很多。派系领袖和邪恶巫师也可能提供他们的研究和见解，帮助玩家顺利前行。",
	"House von Kessel ruled Westemär from the capital of Drakkenheim for one hundred fifty years. The last monarch, Ulrich IV, inherited a period of relative political stability, and so pursued interests in architecture, education, and carnal affairs instead of politics and warfare. He married a Caspian princess, Lenore, and they had three children: Leonard, Katarina, and Eliza. Ulrich IV was ten years into his reign when the meteor struck Drakkenheim. The King, his wife, and their children were never seen again after that day, but their true fate remains a mystery.": "凯塞尔伯爵家族自首都德拉肯海姆统治了西特马尔一百五十年。最后一位君主，乌尔里希四世，继承了一个相对政治稳定的时期，因此他更关注建筑、教育和肉体之事，而非政治和战争。他娶了一位卡斯皮亚公主莱诺尔，他们育有三个孩子：伦纳德、卡塔琳娜和伊丽莎。乌尔里希四世在位十年时，德拉肯海姆遭到陨石袭击。国王、王后和他们的孩子在那天之后再也没有被见到，但他们的真实命运仍然是个谜。",
	"However, many members of the royal household were not in Drakkenheim when the meteor struck, including the King's younger siblings, Mannfred and Cecilia von Kessel. The two spent vast sums commissioning the clergy of the Sacred Flame and the mages of the Amethyst Academy to use divination magic to discern what happened, but to no avail. They nearly bankrupted themselves by launching multiple large-scale military expeditions attempting to reclaim Drakkenheim, all of which failed. Eventually, Mannfred became convinced further efforts were futile, and proposed he would take up the crown and relocate the capital. However, Cecilia contested the claim, arguing there was no conclusive evidence that confirmed their brother and his children were dead. The nobility was divided over the issue, and a civil war ensued that raged for nearly a decade. As Westemär itself descended into political and financial ruin, Mannfred von Kessel and his children were assassinated in a dramatic betrayal. Cecilia von Kessel herself died unexpectedly only a few days later, leaving behind no heirs of her own. Lacking a clear successor, the Civil War ended with a whimper.": "然而，当陨石降临时，许多皇室成员并不在德拉肯海姆，包括国王的弟弟曼弗雷德(Mannfred)和塞西莉亚(Cecilia)·冯·凯塞尔。这两人花费巨资委托圣焰教会的神职人员和紫晶学院的法师使用占卜魔法来查明事情的真相，但毫无结果。他们几乎破产，发动了多次大规模的军事远征，试图夺回德拉肯海姆，但所有尝试都以失败告终。最终，曼弗雷德相信进一步努力是徒劳无功，提议自己接过王位并迁都。然而，塞西莉亚对此提出异议，认为没有确凿证据证实他们的兄弟及其子女已经死亡。贵族对此意见不一，一场持续近十年的内战爆发。随着韦斯特马尔(Westemär)本身陷入政治和财政困境，曼弗雷德·冯·凯塞尔和他的子女在一场惊人的背叛中被暗杀。塞西莉亚·冯·凯塞尔本人在几天后意外去世，没有留下自己的继承人。由于缺乏明确的继承人，内战以失败告终。",

Those who knew the King in life remember him as a capable if overindulgent ruler who left most matters of state to his administrators.": "他是一个身材魁梧、个子中等的男人，留着一把卷曲的胡须，相貌平平。艺术作品经常夸大他的外表，展现出一个英雄般的粗壮胸膛、一把浓密的卷曲胡须和一副威严的面容。庄严的艺术作品展示了他穿着一件皇家披风，戴着{@item Crown of Westemär|DoDk}。那些在生前认识这位国王的人记得他是一个能干但过度放纵的统治者，大部分国事都交给了他的行政官员处理。",

Artwork often depicts him as an aristocratic young soldier with sandy brown hair wearing a dragon-decorated breastplate and wielding a longsword.": "当流星撞击时，莱昂纳德（Leonard）已经十八岁，但现在应该是三十三岁。他很小的时候就对军事感兴趣。艺术作品经常将他描绘成一个有着金黄色头发、穿着装饰有龙图案胸甲、手持长剑的贵族年轻士兵。",
	"was an inquisitive and acrobatic eleven-year-old with wide eyes and auburn hair. She typically wore a frilled shirt, fitted trousers, and cape instead of dresses, and had a penchant for stealing hats. She would now be twenty six years old.": "她是一个好奇而擅长杂技的十一岁小女孩，眼睛大大的，头发是赤褐色的。她通常穿着褶边衬衫、合身的长裤和披风，而不是裙子，喜欢偷帽子。她现在应该是二十六岁了。",

There are many reasons why a potential claimant to the throne hasn't emerged yet.

While an heir could possess a locket, signet ring, or some other document, this must be substantiated with something from the ruins to prove their identity and ancestry. Consider introducing one of the following additional complications:": "在战役开始时，王位继承人尚未出现，也没有任何可靠的王位索赔者站了出来。潜在的王位索赔者尚未出现有许多原因。数十年的丑闻、灾难和战争已经摧毁了公共记录，通过魔法手段来确定血统需要乌尔里希四世的血液或遗骸。虽然继承人可能拥有一枚小锁链、印玺戒指或其他文件，但这必须通过废墟中的某物来证实他们的身份和血统。考虑引入以下额外的复杂情节之一：",

Much like an earthquake, hurricane, or volcano, the calamitous forces that cause such magical catastrophes are entirely beyond mortal means to control or reverse. This fact may come as a surprise to players who expect they can simply defeat some tangible evil entity and save the world.

	"While outwardly presenting a tantalizing mystery, the meteor functions more as a catalyst for conflict in Drakkenheim.

	"The personal quests have been kept open-ended so you can work with your players to deeply customize them. You should feel free to integrate unexpected twists or complications along the way, and establish strong connections to the city, events, and factions in the process. Here's a few suggestions for how these quests might proceed:": "个人任务一直保持开放性，这样你就可以与玩家合作，深度定制它们。你应该随意地在途中加入意想不到的转折或复杂情节，并在过程中与城市、事件和派系建立紧密联系。以下是这些任务可能进行的一些建议：",
	"The character's relative may be found in an area of the Deep Haze: near the Inscrutable Tower, Queen's Park, the crater, or perhaps in thrall to the Duchess or the {@creature Pale Man|DoDk}. Unfortunately, they are indeed mad, and once found resist capture and constantly try to escape. A monstrous transformation can be reversed in three ways: using a {@spell wish} spell, by {@creature Lucretia Mathias|DoDk} performing a divine intervention, or by researching the {@spell siphon contamination|DoDk} spell.": "这个角色的亲戚可能在深雾地区的某个地方被找到：靠近难以理解的塔楼、女王公园、火山口，或者可能被公爵夫人或者{@creature Pale Man|DoDk}所控制。不幸的是，他们确实疯狂了，一旦被找到就会抵抗捕获，并不断试图逃跑。一个怪物般的变身可以通过三种方式逆转：使用{@spell wish}法术，通过{@creature Lucretia Mathias|DoDk}进行神圣干预，或者研究{@spell siphon contamination|DoDk}法术。",
	"This quest ties the character strongly to a central conflict in the campaign. A fun twist is introducing a rival adventurer with an equally valid claim. Consult that section for more details. This character could even be one of the children of Ulrich IV.": "这个任务将角色与战役中的核心冲突紧密联系在一起。一个有趣的转折是引入一个同样有合理主张的竞争冒险者。请查看该部分以获取更多细节。这个角色甚至可以是乌尔里希四世(Ulrich IV)的孩子之一。",
	"This character will need to seek out the means to survive the most contaminated area in the city. Once they reach the heart of the crater, the character has another apocalyptic vision when they touch the Delerium Heart. The character must now decide what they will do to save the world.": "这个角色将需要寻找方法在城市中最受污染的区域生存下来。一旦他们到达火山口的中心，当他们触摸到疯狂之心(Delerium Heart)时，这个角色又有了另一个启示。现在，这个角色必须决定他们将如何拯救世界。",
	"Advancement in a faction requires a full commitment from the character, exclusive of any other faction. Achieving this quest happens when a faction's leader regards the character as a capable and trusted confidant, and appoints them as their right-hand lieutenant. The most challenging aspect of this quest are the conflicts of interest it may cause with the other player characters, but embrace this conflict as a sticking point between the characters!": "在一个派系中晋升需要角色全身心投入，不能同时加入其他派系。完成这个任务的关键是派系领袖认为角色是一个能干且值得信赖的密友，并任命他们为自己的得力副手。这个任务最具挑战性的方面是可能会引起与其他玩家角色之间的利益冲突，但要将这种冲突视为角色之间的一个关键点！",
	"This is a very difficult personal quest, but a straightforward one. The faction leaders are all well-protected and formidable in their own right, though {@creature Lord Commander Elias Drexel|DoDk|Elias Drexel} and {@creature Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal|DoDk|Theodore Marshal} are significantly easier to encounter in person. Characters targeting the {@creature Queen of Thieves|DoDk} or {@creature Eldrick Runeweaver|DoDk} are in for a vexing challenge!": "这是一个非常困难的个人任务，但是一个直截了当的任务。派系领袖们都有很好的保护措施，并且在自己的权利范围内是强大的，尽管{@creature Lord Commander Elias Drexel|DoDk|Elias Drexel}和{@creature Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal|DoDk|Theodore Marshal}更容易亲自遇见。那些瞄准{@creature Queen of Thieves|DoDk}或{@creature Eldrick Runeweaver|DoDk}的角色将面临令人头疼的挑战！",
	"These spells can be learned from {@creature Oscar Yoren|DoDk}, the {@creature Pale Man|DoDk}, Ryan Greymere and spellbooks contained within the Inscrutable Tower; the character must seek knowledge from each. Collecting these spells raises the ire of the Amethyst Academy, who wish to keep knowledge of this magic secret. Characters can complete this quest by researching the {@spell contaminated power|DoDk} spell.": "这些咒语可以从{@creature Oscar Yoren|DoDk}、{@creature Pale Man|DoDk}、Ryan Greymere以及位于神秘塔内的咒语书中学习；角色必须向每个人寻求知识。收集这些咒语会激怒紫水晶学院，他们希望保持这种魔法知识的秘密。角色可以通过研究{@spell contaminated power|DoDk}咒语来完成这个任务。",
	"After visiting each location, the character can research the {@item Aqua Expurgo|DoDk|aqua expurgo potion}, {@spell neutralizing field|DoDk}, and {@spell contamination immunity|DoDk} spells respectively, even if they haven't met the other prerequisites to research these spells.": "在访问每个地点后，角色可以分别研究{@item Aqua Expurgo|DoDk|aqua expurgo potion}，{@spell neutralizing field|DoDk}和{@spell contamination immunity|DoDk}法术，即使他们没有满足研究这些法术的其他先决条件。",
	"Captive or convert, the relative is found at a faction stronghold. They could even be one of the faction lieutenants! It is difficult to convince them to leave; they have to see the faction do something horrible with their own eyes.": "俘虏或者改变信仰，亲戚被发现在一个派系的据点。他们甚至可能是派系的副手之一！要说服他们离开是困难的；他们必须亲眼看到派系做出一些可怕的事情。",
	"Rival adventurers, a Queen's Men strike team, or an assassin might be pursuing a bounty on the character. You may want to have the Queen of Thieves or the Amethyst Academy \"acquire\" the character's debt and use that as leverage over them!": "竞争对手冒险者，女王的士兵突击队，或刺客可能正在追捕角色的悬赏。你可能希望让盗贼女王或紫晶学院“收购”角色的债务，并利用这一点来对他们施加压力！",
	"Any rare magic item is an appropriate heirloom, and you can choose any location in the city where the item is lost, although Reed Manor, the Kleinberg Estate, and Slaughterstone Square are good possibilities. If you'd really like to create complications, this item could be stolen by the Queen of Thieves or a rival adventurer, or could even be one of the Seals of Drakkenheim.": "任何稀有的魔法物品都可以作为合适的传家宝，你可以选择城市中物品丢失的任何地点，尽管里德庄园、克莱因伯格庄园和屠石广场都是不错的选择。如果你想制造麻烦，这件物品可能会被盗贼女王或竞争对手冒险家偷走，甚至可能是德拉肯海姆的封印之一。",
	"The ritual the character wishes to perform at each location need not be simple. Instead, it might be a time-consuming process that requires a rare offering and takes several hours to complete, or perhaps can only be performed at a certain time of day (either dawn or dusk). As such, the character will need the protection and support of their allies to stay safe during the rite.": "角色希望在每个地点执行的仪式不一定简单。相反，它可能是一个耗时的过程，需要一种稀有的供品，并需要几个小时才能完成，或者可能只能在一天中的某个特定时间（黎明或黄昏）执行。因此，角色将需要他们的盟友的保护和支持，以在仪式期间保持安全。",
	"Suitable foes might include the {@creature Rat Prince|DoDk}, the {@creature Crimson Countess|DoDk}, the Duchess, the {@creature Lord of the Feast|DoDk}, the Prince of Carnage, a {@creature grotesque gargant|DoDk}, or a {@creature crater wurm|DoDk}.": "适合的敌人可能包括{@creature Rat Prince|DoDk}、{@creature Crimson Countess|DoDk}、公爵夫人、{@creature Lord of the Feast|DoDk}、屠戮王子、{@creature grotesque gargant|DoDk}或{@creature crater wurm|DoDk}。",
	"Upon completing a personal quest, a player character gains rewards as described in {@area chapter 1|010|x}. In addition, you should reward each character in the party experience points based on the advancement method you are using.": "完成个人任务后，玩家角色会获得如{@area chapter 1|010|x}所描述的奖励。此外，你应根据你所使用的进阶方法，奖励队伍中每个角色经验点。",
	"When designing a custom personal quest, keep the following principles in mind:": "设计自定义个人任务时，请牢记以下原则：",
	"The quest should require characters to explore one or more locations within the Inner City ruins. A character shouldn't be able to complete their personal quest too early. Conversely, a personal quest involving Castle Drakken likely can't be completed until late in the campaign.": "任务应该要求角色在内城废墟中探索一个或多个地点。一个角色不应该能够太早完成他们的个人任务。相反，涉及到德拉肯城堡的个人任务可能要等到战役后期才能完成。",
	"It should present some sort of complication with one of the factions, or perhaps require the characters to seek help from the faction to complete their quest.": "任务应该与其中一个派系出现某种复杂情况，或者需要角色寻求该派系的帮助来完成他们的任务。",
	"The quest should be specific and achievable, and not related to character advancement (such as reaching 10th level or taking a specific feat).": "任务应该具体可行，并且与角色进阶无关（比如达到10级或获得特定天赋）。",
	"Be careful about using a \"ticking clock\" for a personal quest. While this can introduce a compelling complication, focus on long-term goals rather than extremely urgent matters.": "在个人任务中使用“滴答作响的时钟”要小心。虽然这可以引入引人入胜的复杂情节，但更应专注于长期目标，而不是极其紧急的事务。",
	"Players often suggest personal quests involving missing persons, lost objects, or revenge. Many example personal quests provided already cover such motivations, such as \"A Family Matter'', \"A Lost Heirloom\", and \"A Score to Settle\". Ask players to consider these options first. Perhaps their idea can be easily adapted to work with one of these quests (or vice versa).": "玩家经常提出涉及失踪人员、失物或复仇的个人任务建议。已经提供了许多示例个人任务，涵盖了这些动机，比如“家族事务”、“失落的传家宝”和“冤家对头”。建议玩家首先考虑这些选项。也许他们的想法可以很容易地与这些任务之一相结合（反之亦然）。",
	"Five factions are struggling to control the ruins of Drakkenheim: the {@area Hooded Lanterns|0f4|x}, the {@area Queen's Men|16e|x}, the {@area Knights of the Silver Order|138|x}, the {@area Followers of the Falling Fire|0b6|x}, and the {@area Amethyst Academy|07c|x}. Each is commanded by a prominent faction leader, but the faction as a whole behaves like a major recurring NPC, except they are composed of many individuals working together who share the same ideology, goals, methods, and resources. {@adventure Chapter 3: Factions|DoDk|2} describes the background, objectives, roleplaying traits, major NPCs, and assets of each faction. Using this information, it's up to you to determine how the factions might help or hinder the player characters during their adventures in Drakkenheim.": "五个派系正在努力控制德拉肯海姆的废墟：{@area Hooded Lanterns|0f4|x}、{@area Queen's Men|16e|x}、{@area Knights of the Silver Order|138|x}、{@area Followers of the Falling Fire|0b6|x}和{@area Amethyst Academy|07c|x}。每个派系都由一位杰出的派系领袖指挥，但整个派系的行为就像一个重要的经常出现的NPC，除了它们由许多共同分享相同意识形态、目标、方法和资源的个体组成。{@adventure Chapter 3: Factions|DoDk|2}描述了每个派系的背景、目标、角色扮演特征、重要NPC和资产。利用这些信息，由你来决定在德拉肯海姆历险期间，这些派系可能如何帮助或阻碍玩家角色。",
	"Rather than uniting the factions as one against a common foe, the player characters must navigate a fractious web of intrigue, negotiation, sabotage, and violent conflict if they wish to uncover the greatest treasures and secrets in Drakkenheim. Their relationships with each faction will naturally develop as a consequence of the character's choices, but it's ultimately up to them to decide who they want to join and who they will oppose. Thus, each individual faction might become a supportive patron, fierce competitor, close ally, bitter enemy, or anything in between.": "与将派系团结起来对抗共同敌人不同，玩家角色必须在《德拉肯海姆》中航行一个充满纷争的阴谋、谈判、破坏和暴力冲突的网络，如果他们希望揭示最伟大的宝藏和秘密。他们与每个派系的关系将自然地随着角色的选择而发展，但最终由他们决定要加入谁，要反对谁。因此，每个派系可能会成为一个支持的赞助人、激烈的竞争对手、亲密的盟友、激烈的敌人，或者介于两者之间的任何角色。",
	"Exploring the most dangerous locations in Drakkenheim is extraordinarily difficult without gaining the support (or inciting the ire) of one or more factions. Correspondingly, the factions need the player characters' help to accomplish their own goals in the city, and offer rewards to their allies and assistance with the characters' personal quests. Conversely, factions that become antagonistic create dynamic problems and new complications throughout the campaign when they use their resources against the characters. Either way, the factions are best played in a reactive manner. Their leaders make firm demands when characters try to negotiate, orchestrate counterstrikes when characters foil their plans, and conduct sabotage when characters oppose their goals.": "在探索德拉肯海姆最危险的地点时，要想不招致一方或多方势力的支持（或激起他们的愤怒）是非常困难的。相应地，这些势力需要玩家角色的帮助来实现他们在城市中的目标，并向他们的盟友提供奖励，并协助角色的个人任务。相反，如果势力变得敌对，当他们利用资源对抗角色时，会在整个战役中制造动态问题和新的复杂情况。无论哪种情况，最好以一种反应性的方式来玩这些势力。他们的领导在角色试图进行谈判时提出坚定的要求，当角色破坏他们的计划时策划反击，并在角色反对他们目标时进行破坏。",
	"Eventually, these interactions may blossom into a full-scale hostility between the factions. Once this occurs, aim to keep each faction in play as long as possible. Don't be afraid of letting the players get in over their heads if they make enemies with more than one faction, either. Your players will find surprising ways to foil the factions, and develop cunning plans when they collaborate with them. Embrace their creativity by responding with new challenges, and rewarding players when they succeed by having their allies recognize their accomplishments. The factions are equipped with the tools to help you escalate tension and raise the stakes of the conflict in interesting ways.": "最终，这些互动可能会演变成派系之间的全面敌意。一旦发生这种情况，要努力让每个派系尽可能地保持在游戏中。如果玩家与多个派系结怨，也不要害怕让他们陷入困境。你的玩家会想出令人惊讶的方法来挫败派系，并在与他们合作时制定狡猾的计划。通过回应新的挑战来拥抱他们的创造力，并在玩家取得成功时奖励他们，让他们的盟友认可他们的成就。这些派系都配备了工具，可以帮助你升级紧张气氛，以有趣的方式提高冲突的风险。",
	"Many adventure sites provide hooks and missions connected to the factions you may use to prompt the characters to visit each area. Each location also details how the factions could respond to possible events and outcomes that may occur.": "许多冒险场所提供与您可能使用的派系相关的钩子和任务，以促使角色访问每个区域。每个地点还详细说明了派系可能如何对可能发生的事件和结果做出回应。",

	"Despite their conflicts, the faction leaders know they can't achieve their goals on their own. Not only do they seek the aid of the player characters, many factions see the benefits to collaborating with each other. Diplomatic characters could negotiate an alliance, truce, or ceasefire between two (or more) factions. Convincing any two factions to set aside their differences and work together should be difficult, but achievable. In order to broker such a deal, characters will need to demonstrate how the alliance will help both factions achieve their objectives, but also make an appeal to the roleplaying traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws of the factions and their leaders. These tense negotiations can make for some of the most memorable moments in the campaign, so potential alliances are best arranged in dramatic locations such as the faction strongholds and the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio.": "尽管各派系领袖之间存在冲突，但他们知道单凭自己无法实现目标。他们不仅寻求玩家角色的帮助，许多派系也看到与其他派系合作的好处。外交角色可以协商两个（或更多）派系之间的联盟、停战或休战。说服任何两个派系放下分歧共同合作应该是困难的，但可行的。为了促成这样的交易，角色需要展示联盟将如何帮助两个派系实现他们的目标，同时还要针对派系和他们领袖的角色特征、理想、羁绊和缺陷提出呼吁。这些紧张的谈判可能成为战役中最难忘的时刻之一，因此潜在的联盟最好在戏剧性的地点安排，如派系据点和圣维特鲁维奥大教堂。",
	"The factions have been designed such that a long-term alliance between any two factions is achievable, and a short-term truce involving three is difficult but entirely possible. Countless situations in your campaign may emerge that could cause the factions to re-evaluate their priorities, and clever and convincing players might present compelling arguments. Bear in mind of course, that the factions are composed of people: and people don't always act in logical ways. These alliances are always unstable, however, as each faction presses to have their own goals prioritized. Unless the player characters make an ongoing effort to keep a coalition together, any alliance between factions will inevitably collapse.": "这些派系的设计使得任意两个派系之间建立长期联盟是可行的，而涉及三个派系的短期停战虽然困难但完全可能。在你的冒险中可能出现无数情况，这些情况可能导致派系重新评估他们的优先事项，聪明而有说服力的玩家可能会提出令人信服的论点。当然要记住，这些派系由人组成：而人并不总是按照逻辑方式行事。这些联盟总是不稳定的，因为每个派系都在努力推动他们自己的目标得到优先考虑。除非玩家角色不断努力保持联盟的稳定，否则派系之间的任何联盟最终都将崩溃。",
	"Factions such as the Amethyst Academy and the Queen's Men may even use alliances as a convenient opportunity to manipulate the player characters and the other factions, and possibly even make a dramatic reversal at a critical moment. Especially cunning characters might help the factions weave such deceptions and plots, resulting in brutal betrayal against an unsuspecting ally which allows the faction to seize full control of Drakkenheim for themselves.": "诸如紫晶学院和女王之人等派系甚至可能利用联盟作为操纵玩家角色和其他派系的便利机会，甚至在关键时刻进行戏剧性的反转。特别狡猾的角色可能会帮助派系编织这样的欺骗和阴谋，导致对毫无戒心的盟友进行残酷背叛，从而让该派系完全控制德拉肯海姆。",
	"Since the threat of betrayal is so real, player characters who build a coalition between multiple factions may compromise the trust they earn with an individual faction. They won't receive the greatest boons the faction can offer, and faction agents don't trust characters with sensitive information. Faction leaders are wary of double-agents, and would much rather see the player characters make a commitment to them. As a result, the player characters should constantly be called upon to demonstrate their loyalty.": "由于背叛的威胁如此真实，玩家角色如果在多个派系之间建立联盟，可能会损害他们在某个特定派系中获得的信任。他们将无法获得该派系能够提供的最大好处，派系特工也不会信任那些知晓敏感信息的角色。派系领袖对双面间谍心存戒备，更希望看到玩家角色对他们做出承诺。因此，玩家角色应该不断被要求证明他们的忠诚。",
	"Unfortunately for the player characters, discovering the full properties of delerium and facts regarding the meteor's origins will not unite the factions. Instead, these revelations will drive further wedges between the fractious groups since they deeply disagree on the best way to address the problem. Given that The Haze threatens to overtake the entire world, it may at first appear the Silver Order is completely correct that the crystals must be destroyed. Throughout the campaign however, the feasibility of accomplishing such a task should be consistently cast in doubt. You should strive to contrast this viewpoint against the rational yet questionable stance of the Amethyst Academy which insists arcane means may harness delerium to prevent further catastrophe, and the zealous and apocalyptic prophecies of the Followers of the Falling Fire. Whenever it seems like the players have made up their minds, rival factions should present a gnawing sense that some alternative might still be possible. You should avoid presenting any \"correct\" answer: It's up to the characters to piece it all together, draw their own conclusions, and decide how to act.": "对于玩家角色来说，发现癫狂症的全部特性以及关于陨石起源的事实并不能团结各派系。相反，这些揭示将进一步加深这些不和谐团体之间的分歧，因为他们在如何解决问题上存在着深刻分歧。考虑到“薄雾”威胁着整个世界，乍看之下，银色骑士团完全正确，晶体必须被摧毁。然而在整个冒险过程中，应该始终对完成这样一项任务的可行性产生怀疑。你应该努力将这种观点与紫晶学院的理性但值得怀疑的立场形成对比，后者坚持认为奥术手段可能利用癫狂症来防止进一步的灾难，以及追随者们热切而世界末日般的预言。每当玩家似乎已经下定决心时，对手派系应该呈现出一种令人不安的感觉，即仍然可能存在其他选择。你应该避免提供任何“正确”的答案：这取决于角色将所有事情串联起来，得出自己的结论，并决定如何行动。",
	"As such, there is no fixed resolution to the faction conflict. By the end of the campaign, several factions could be routed from Drakkenheim entirely, their leaders slain and strongholds toppled. While a showdown in Castle Drakken is inevitable, who exactly is present for that battle and the outcomes that may arise are unforeseeable. {@adventure Chapter 10: The Fate of Drakkenheim|DoDk|9} describes a few possibilities.": "因此，派系冲突没有固定的解决方案。在战役结束时，有几个派系可能会被彻底驱逐出德拉肯海姆，他们的领袖被杀，据点被摧毁。虽然在德拉肯城堡的决战是不可避免的，但到底有谁参与了那场战斗以及可能出现的结果是无法预料的。{@adventure Chapter 10: The Fate of Drakkenheim|DoDk|9}描述了一些可能性。",

When it comes to making a good rival, interesting roleplaying traits are far more important than game statistics.

	"A flock of {@creature Harpy||harpies} dwells in the Cosmological Clocktower. They viciously attack any who trespass on their territory, but they are deathly afraid of cats.": "{@creature Harpy||harpies}群居在宇宙钟楼中。他们凶猛地攻击任何侵入他们领地的人，但他们却对猫感到死怕。",
	"Whispers say the {@creature Ratling|DoDk|ratlings} serve a demonic god.": "传闻中 {@creature Ratling|DoDk|ratlings} 侍奉着一个恶魔之神。",
	"Many of the monsters lurking in Drakkenheim are in fact its former inhabitants, twisted by fell magic. They can be made docile by showing them a token of their former life.": "德拉肯海姆(Drakkenheim)中许多潜伏的怪物实际上是它的前居民，被邪恶魔法扭曲了。通过展示他们以前生活的标志，它们可以变得温顺。",
	"Marlowe has no intention of turning back, and insists the caravan press on towards Emberwood Village (described in {@adventure chapter 4|DoDk|3}). In town, they will meet agents of the five factions, detailed in the next chapter.": "马洛没有打算回头，坚持让队伍继续前往(在{@adventure chapter 4|DoDk|3})描述的安伯伍德村。在镇上，他们将会遇到五个派系的代理人，详细内容会在下一章中描述。",
	"This chapter describes the roleplaying traits, resources, and major NPCs for each of the five factions. Each dossier is broken down into the following sections:": "本章描述了五个派系的角色扮演特征、资源和重要NPC。每个档案都分为以下几个部分：",
	"This details a brief history of each faction and its recent activities in Drakkenheim.": "这份文件详细描述了德拉肯海姆（Drakkenheim）每个派系的简要历史以及最近的活动。",
	"These describe the faction's major goals in Drakkenheim. Most concern two core conflicts that define the campaign: {@i Who should control Drakkenheim? What should be done about delerium}? Conflict is inevitable because every faction desires very different outcomes with regard to these questions. All wish to control the ruins and decide how delerium will be used (or destroyed). In addition, some factions have additional objectives which may directly oppose those of a rival faction.": "这些描述了在德拉肯海姆中派系的主要目标。大多数涉及到定义了这场战役的两个核心冲突：{@i Who should control Drakkenheim? What should be done about delerium}？冲突是不可避免的，因为每个派系对这些问题有着非常不同的期望。所有人都希望控制废墟，并决定如何使用（或摧毁）疯狂石。此外，一些派系还有额外的目标，这些目标可能直接与对手派系的目标相冲突。",
	"Each faction's {@b Roleplaying Traits} resonate strongly with their {@b Objectives}. However, a faction may tolerate setting aside or even adjusting its objectives if it perceives a chance for greater gain in the future; if acting on its objectives would incite overwhelming retribution from political forces beyond Drakkenheim; or if circumstances emerge where achieving its objectives would contradict the faction's own ideals. In such a situation, a faction might even modify its objectives. Player characters might create alliances or expose weaknesses in the factions by taking advantage of this fact.": "每个派系的{@b Roleplaying Traits}与他们的{@b Objectives}紧密相关。然而，如果一个派系认为未来有更大的收益机会，它可能会容忍搁置甚至调整其目标；如果按照其目标行事会引发来自德拉肯海姆以外政治力量的压倒性报复；或者如果出现情况，实现其目标将与该派系自身理念相矛盾。在这种情况下，一个派系甚至可能修改其目标。玩家角色可以利用这一事实建立联盟或揭示派系的弱点。",
	"Each faction has two major NPCs: the faction leader and their lieutenant(s). The stat blocks for these characters are detailed in {@adventure Appendix B|DoDk|11}, and their roleplay traits are provided here. Use these NPCs as the player characters' primary points-of-contact during faction interactions such as:": "每个派系都有两个重要的NPC：派系领袖和他们的副手。这些角色的属性块在{@adventure Appendix B|DoDk|11}中详细描述，他们的角色扮演特征在这里提供。在派系互动中，将这些NPC作为玩家角色的主要联系人，例如：",
	"Briefing or hiring the characters for a mission,": "为一项任务进行简要介绍或雇佣角色。",
	"Meetings and diplomatic negotiations,": "会议和外交谈判 (Meetings and diplomatic negotiations)",
	"Sharing information, advice, and creating mutual plans,": "分享信息，建议，并制定共同计划，",
	"Offering rewards or resources to the player characters on behalf of the faction.": "代表派系向玩家角色提供奖励或资源。",
	"A formidable legendary non-player character commands each faction. These faction leaders issue orders to faction agents, direct faction resources, and make the final decision on how the faction acts in all matters. Each has their own individual Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws, and perhaps a few dark secrets too! As conflict in Drakkenheim escalates, the player characters should interact with the faction leaders often, and might even bring several faction leaders together for negotiations.": "每个阵营都有一位强大的传奇非玩家角色来指挥。这些阵营领袖向阵营特工发布命令，管理阵营资源，并最终决定阵营在所有事务上的行动。每位领袖都有自己独特的个性特征、理想、羁绊和缺陷，也许还有一些黑暗的秘密！随着德拉肯海姆的冲突升级，玩家角色应经常与阵营领袖互动，甚至可能让几位领袖共同进行谈判。",
	"The faction leaders spend most of their time coordinating strategy and logistics within their faction stronghold. They are the organizational lynchpin for their entire faction, and rarely take to the field. A faction leader should only personally venture into Drakkenheim for a major gathering or offensive involving the cathedral, Castle Drakken, or a faction stronghold. The risk to the faction is simply too great to risk their lives in the field otherwise.": "派系领袖大部分时间都花在协调他们派系要塞内的战略和后勤工作上。他们是整个派系的组织中枢，很少亲自上阵。派系领袖只应在涉及大型聚会或攻势，涉及大教堂、德拉肯城堡或派系要塞时亲自前往德拉肯海姆。否则，冒着生命危险亲自上阵对派系来说风险太大。",
	"If a faction leader is slain or permanently {@condition incapacitated}, the faction must withdraw from Drakkenheim shortly thereafter unless there is someone else to take up their mantle. Surviving faction agents may seek immediate retribution, but the death of a faction leader seals their defeat in Drakkenheim for the foreseeable future.": "如果一个派系领袖被杀或永久{@condition incapacitated}，该派系必须在此之后不久撤离德拉肯海姆，除非有其他人接替他们的位置。幸存的派系特工可能会寻求立即报复，但派系领袖的死亡意味着他们在可预见的未来内在德拉肯海姆的失败。",
	"Under the right circumstances, a player character who demonstrates unwavering belief in the faction and great leadership could rise through the ranks and replace a faction leader.": "在适当的情况下，一个玩家角色如果表现出对派系的坚定信念和出色的领导能力，就有可能在派系中逐级晋升，并取代一个派系领袖。",
	"The faction lieutenant is the right-hand of the faction leader. As such, the lieutenant is usually the first point of contact the player characters have with a faction, and most can be encountered in Emberwood Village. Once the lieutenant is confident the players are capable and trustworthy collaborators, they'll facilitate an introduction with the faction leader.": "派系副官是派系领袖的得力助手。因此，副官通常是玩家角色与派系接触的第一人，大多数可以在灰木村遇到。一旦副官确信玩家有能力并值得信赖作为合作伙伴，他们会安排与派系领袖的见面。",
	"Many lieutenants also lead elite faction strike teams. If the lieutenant is slain, the faction leader will appoint another faction member as a replacement.": "许多中尉也领导着精英派系突击小队。如果中尉被杀，派系领袖将任命另一名派系成员作为替补。",
	"Each faction has numerous rank-and-file members, support staff, craftspeople, recruits, and other followers. Use these lists to generate quick NPCs who might be guarding a stronghold, relaying a message, maintaining the supply lines, or fighting alongside (or against!) the player characters. You can add additional NPCs to the factions if you wish, but be careful when adding high-level NPCs or spellcasters capable of casting spells above 3rd level. The factions have specific and limited access to high-level magic. Powerful NPCs are meant to be rare so the player characters may rise to a position of importance and prominence during the campaign.": "每个派系都有众多的普通成员、支持人员、手工艺人、新兵和其他追随者。利用这些名单来生成可能在守卫要塞、传递消息、维护补给线或与玩家角色并肩作战（或对抗）的快速NPC。如果愿意，你可以向派系中添加额外的NPC，但在添加能施放3级以上法术的高级NPC或法师时要小心。派系对高级魔法的获取是特定且有限的。强大的NPC应该是稀有的，以便玩家角色在战役中崭露头角并升至重要地位。",
	"Much like a player character, every faction has Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws. Rather than qualities of any individual person, these describe ideological beliefs shared by all faction members. Use these characteristics to guide roleplaying interactions with faction agents, determine the way the faction behaves, and judge how their leaders might react to changing circumstances or unexpected events.": "就像玩家角色一样，每个派别都有个性特征、理想、羁绊和缺点。与任何个人的品质不同，这些描述的是所有派别成员共享的意识形态信念。利用这些特征来引导与派别代理人的角色扮演互动，确定派别的行为方式，并判断他们的领导者可能如何对待变化的情况或意外事件。",
	"Faction NPCs often possess these characteristics, but may have their own personal interpretations. However, a faction that betrays its ideals or bonds has betrayed its own members. When a faction repeatedly fails to uphold its own ideals and bonds, its agents might start deserting Drakkenheim or refuse to comply when called to action.": "派系NPC通常具有这些特征，但可能有他们自己的个人解释。然而，一个背叛其理想或羁绊的派系就是在背叛自己的成员。当一个派系反复未能坚守自己的理想和羁绊时，其特工可能会开始逃离德拉肯海姆，或在被召唤行动时拒绝服从。",
	"Most factions have several holdings in Drakkenheim, but one major location is the faction stronghold. Full details on each faction stronghold are described in {@adventure chapter 8|DoDk|7}. This is where most faction members reside and where many faction resources are kept. If a faction loses its stronghold, the rank-and-file members are routed and the power of the faction is broken. If the faction leader survives, they may still be able to muster together a few remaining diehard agents to cause a few more complications for the player characters, but the faction teeters on the brink of defeat.": "大多数派系在德拉肯海姆拥有几处据点，但一个主要地点是派系的据点。每个派系据点的详细信息在{@adventure chapter 8|DoDk|7}中描述。这是大多数派系成员居住的地方，也是许多派系资源的存放地。如果一个派系失去了它的据点，普通成员会四散逃离，派系的力量会受到瓦解。如果派系领袖幸存下来，他们可能仍然能够召集一些顽固的特工来给玩家角色制造更多麻烦，但派系岌岌可危。",
	"As useful as magicians and wizards can be when organized, You should always have a bag of tricks...for sale of course.": "魔术师和巫师在组织起来时可能非常有用，但你总是应该有一袋戏法...当然是要出售的。",
	"The faction leader or faction lieutenant may present these missions to the player characters, which further the faction's objectives. The missions are presented in a rough progression: those presented first may lead to later ones. Characters who complete these missions gain greater respect and trust from the faction, and are rewarded with faction boons (described below). In addition, when the player characters complete a faction mission they receive experience points based on the advancement method you are using (as described in {@area Character Advancement|023|x} in {@adventure chapter 2|DoDk|1}).": "派系领袖或派系副领袖可以向玩家角色提供这些任务，以推动派系的目标。 这些任务以大致的顺序呈现：首先呈现的任务可能会导致后续任务。 完成这些任务的角色会从派系获得更多的尊重和信任，并获得派系奖励（如下所述）。此外，当玩家角色完成一个派系任务时，根据您使用的升级方法（如{@area Character Advancement|023|x}中所述在{@adventure chapter 2|DoDk|1}中）获得经验点。",
	"Many missions are directly tied to the {@b City Locations} described in {@adventure chapters 6|DoDk|5} and {@adventure 7|DoDk|6}. In such cases, further details for running that mission are found in the \"Adventure Hooks\" section of the location entry. Other missions are open-ended adventure seeds to spur interactions with other factions. Nevertheless, you should feel free to invent additional missions for the factions based on the player characters' choices. Especially when the factions clash against each other, the player characters themselves collaborate with their faction allies to devise their own missions and specific goals.": "许多任务直接与在{@adventure chapters 6|DoDk|5}和{@adventure 7|DoDk|6}中描述的{@b City Locations}相关联。在这种情况下，有关运行该任务的进一步细节可在位置条目的“冒险钩子”部分找到。其他任务是开放式的冒险种子，用以促进与其他派系的互动。然而，您可以根据玩家角色的选择自由发挥，为派系创造额外的任务。特别是当派系之间发生冲突时，玩家角色本身会与他们的派系盟友合作，制定自己的任务和具体目标。",
	"Every faction possesses valuable resources and knowledge they use to advance their agenda, including equipment, information, magic items, mounts, spellcasting services, and more. These are represented by faction boons, which may be awarded to the player characters for completing faction missions, but also offered to player characters {@i before} a mission to help them complete it.": "每个派系都拥有宝贵的资源和知识，它们用来推动自己的议程，包括装备、信息、魔法物品、坐骑、施法服务等等。这些都由派系奖励来代表，可以作为奖励给玩家角色完成派系任务，也可以提供给玩家角色{@i before}一项任务来帮助他们完成任务。",
	"These boons are presented in a roughly escalating order: latter boons should only be offered later in the campaign to characters who have demonstrated their commitment to the faction. Unless otherwise indicated, a faction can only offer each boon once. Beyond this, how often you reward characters with a faction boon is up to you.": "这些恩惠按照大致递增的顺序呈现：后续的恩惠应该只在战役后期向已经展示对该派系承诺的角色提供。除非另有说明，一个派系只能提供每个恩惠一次。除此之外，奖励角色派系恩惠的频率由你决定。",
	"The factions' exact assets and wealth are intentionally abstract so you may exercise your judgement and decide what's appropriate given the circumstances. Regardless, the factions do not have infinite resources. Every faction is stretched thin, and must cope with severe limits and constraints on their finances, personnel, materials, equipment, and time. The nearest large city is several weeks' travel away and the surrounding villages have been abandoned. More troops require exponentially more supplies since there are so few uncontaminated food and water sources. For many of the factions, simply maintaining the ground they currently hold requires everything they've got. {@b This is why the factions need the player characters to help them.}": "各派系的确切资产和财富被故意抽象化，以便您可以行使判断权，并根据情况决定什么是合适的。无论如何，各派系都没有无限的资源。每个派系都在财务、人员、材料、装备和时间方面受到严格限制和约束。最近的大城市需要数周的旅行时间，周围的村庄已经被遗弃。更多的部队需要指数倍的供应，因为几乎没有未受污染的食物和水源。对于许多派系来说，仅仅维持他们目前控制的领土就需要他们付出一切。{@b This is why the factions need the player characters to help them.}",
	"The characters may occasionally demand more from the factions; citing dire need or urgent circumstances. If the characters push hard for more resources and appeal to the factions' ideals, objectives, and bonds, you might grant them an additional boon for that mission. However, the next time the characters need help from the faction or would receive a boon, the faction can't offer them anything as they are recuperating their stockpile!": "角色们偶尔可能会向派系要求更多；引用迫切需要或紧急情况。如果角色们努力争取更多资源，并呼吁派系的理念、目标和联系，你可能会为该任务授予他们额外的恩惠。然而，下次角色们需要派系的帮助或将获得恩惠时，由于他们正在恢复库存，派系无法为他们提供任何帮助！",
	"While the factions seek assistance from the player characters, they aren't without their own agents. When they must dispatch their own warriors directly into the ruins, they send a {@b Strike Team}.": "当派系寻求玩家角色的帮助时，他们也有自己的特工。当他们必须直接派遣自己的战士进入废墟时，他们会派遣一个{@b Strike Team}。",
	"An allied faction might send strike teams as reinforcements to help the player characters on a critical mission. Consequently, an enemy faction can dispatch a strike team against the player characters to disrupt missions, capture them, or even assassinate them. Each faction keeps tabs on the player characters, and might even send a strike team to interfere during a mission that wouldn't otherwise involve them just to sabotage the characters' efforts. More ruthless factions might take the fight directly to the characters' doorsteps, hitting them while they are retreating, recuperating, or simply unprepared for battle. Especially devious GMs may opt to have faction strike teams operate behind-the-scenes by carrying out attacks while the player characters are occupied elsewhere!": "一个盟友派系可能会派遣突击小队作为增援，帮助玩家角色完成一项关键任务。因此，敌对派系可能会派遣一支突击小队对抗玩家角色，以破坏任务、抓捕他们，甚至暗杀他们。每个派系都会密切关注玩家角色，并可能甚至派遣一支突击小队在本不涉及他们的任务中干扰，以破坏角色的努力。更为残忍的派系可能会直接向角色的家门口发起攻击，趁他们撤退、休养或者毫无准备地进行战斗。尤其阴险的GM可能选择让派系突击小队在幕后行动，趁玩家角色在别处忙碌时发动袭击！",
	"Any faction can call up a strike team within a few hour's notice. However, mustering up larger forces for major offensives takes time. When a faction needs to assemble multiple teams at once to perform a specific task, it takes at least one day per strike team involved. This can give characters the chance to notice something big is being planned.": "任何派系都可以在几小时内召集一支突击小队。然而，为了进行重大进攻，集结更大的力量需要时间。当一个派系需要同时组建多支小队来执行特定任务时，每增加一支突击小队就需要至少一天的时间。这可以让角色有机会察觉到正在策划一项重大行动。",
	"The factions regularly bring in reinforcements and new recruits. However, increasing casualties amongst the rank-and-file devastate morale within all the factions, and it's a problem when its more elite strike teams are captured, defeated, or killed. When a faction strike team is destroyed, it takes roughly five days for the faction to assemble a replacement team. Under desperate circumstances, a faction can put together another group immediately. Should this group also be taken out, it takes ten days to draw up further replacements thereafter.": "各派系经常会增援和招募新成员。然而，基层成员的伤亡增加严重打击了所有派系的士气，当其精英突击队被俘虏、击败或杀死时，问题就更加严重了。当一个派系的突击队被摧毁时，大约需要五天时间才能重新组建一个替补队伍。在绝望的情况下，一个派系可以立即组建另一个小组。如果这个小组也被消灭，之后再次组建替补队伍需要十天时间。",
	"Faction leaders often investigate when their agents go missing. Each faction possesses a web of informants, {@creature Scout||scouts}, and {@creature Spy||spies}, and can possibly use magical means to find out what happened. Unless an active effort is made to conceal what occurred, most factions can discover the fate of their agents within seven days and possibly even determine who was responsible. Skirmishes between adventurers and low-level faction agents are relatively common in the ruins, so such events may not incite immediate retribution, but rather careful observation. If the situation continues to escalate, the faction responds.": "派系领袖经常在他们的特工失踪时进行调查。每个派系都拥有一系列的线人，{@creature Scout||scouts}，和{@creature Spy||spies}，并且可能会使用魔法手段来查明发生了什么事。除非有积极的努力来掩盖发生的事情，大多数派系都可以在七天内发现他们特工的命运，甚至可能确定谁是责任人。冒险者和低级别派系特工之间的小规模冲突在废墟中相对常见，因此这类事件可能不会立即引起报复，而是会被谨慎观察。如果情况继续升级，派系会做出回应。",
	"Every faction knows that sending large numbers of soldiers into Drakkenheim is a foolish risk: several attempts have been made by much larger forces and failed. The biggest issue is contamination: there simply aren't enough spellcasters and materials to remove it quickly enough. Generally speaking, the factions will only consider launching major offensives if it means taking the cathedral, Castle Drakken, or another faction stronghold.": "每个派系都知道，向德拉肯海姆派遣大量士兵是一个愚蠢的风险：许多更大规模的部队曾经尝试过，但都失败了。最大的问题是污染：根本没有足够的法师和材料来迅速清除它。一般来说，只有当攻击意味着夺取大教堂、德拉肯城堡或其他派系的据点时，派系才会考虑发动重大进攻。",
	"Should your player characters become enemies with one of the factions, the factions enact these dastardly plots against them. These schemes are presented in escalating hostility; so latter schemes are only used in dire conflict. Set one of these schemes into motion the next time the player characters venture into the ruins. If the players manage to foil the faction's schemes, the defeated faction will need at least a week before they can muster up another. On the other hand, the factions don't do things \"just to get revenge\". They instead consider their long-term goals first. They retreat, regroup, and find a way to attack from a position of strength.": "如果你的玩家角色与其中一个派系成为敌人，那么这些派系会对他们实施这些卑鄙的阴谋。这些计划按照敌意逐渐升级呈现；因此后续计划只会在紧急冲突中使用。在玩家角色下次冒险进入废墟时，启动其中一个计划。如果玩家设法挫败了派系的计划，被打败的派系将需要至少一周的时间才能再次集结。另一方面，这些派系不会“只是为了报复而行动”。他们首先考虑他们的长期目标。他们会撤退、重新集结，并找到一种从强势地位发起攻击的方式。",
	"You can invent your own schemes. Try using a strike team in a creative or unexpected way, or consider the personal capabilities of each faction leader: especially the spells, magic items, and unique knowledge at their disposal. Don't be afraid to turn the player characters' own motivations, goals, and flaws against them either!": "你可以发明自己的计划。尝试以创造性或意想不到的方式使用突击小组，或考虑每个派系领袖的个人能力：特别是他们掌握的法术、魔法物品和独特知识。也不要害怕将玩家角色自己的动机、目标和缺点用来对付他们！",
	"The player characters have demonstrated themselves to be staunch supporters of the faction's cause. They've successfully completed multiple missions for the faction that prove their loyalty, including a mission where they acted directly against another faction. The faction offers the characters complete access to their resources, support, and information. The characters receive faction boons to help them complete missions.": "玩家角色已经证明自己是该派系事业的坚定支持者。他们成功完成了多个任务，证明了他们的忠诚，其中包括一项直接针对另一个派系的任务。该派系为角色提供了完全访问他们的资源、支持和信息。角色们获得了派系福利，帮助他们完成任务。",
	"The party and the faction are working together to advance their mutual goals, but they have some minor differences and disagreements. Characters might be working with multiple factions in this manner. The characters have helped the faction in several ways by completing a few missions, and proven themselves reliable and capable. The faction rewards characters with boons after they complete these missions.": "该队伍和派系正在共同努力推进彼此的共同目标，但他们之间存在一些轻微的分歧和分歧。角色可能以这种方式与多个派系合作。角色通过完成一些任务帮助了该派系，并证明了自己是可靠且能干的。在完成这些任务后，该派系会奖励角色一些好处。",
	"They are neutral. Perhaps they aren't known to each other yet. The faction is willing to hire the party on a freelance basis to help fulfil their objectives—especially ones that require arms' length interaction (such as working against another faction), but the faction doesn't trust the players yet. They may have had some rough interactions with low-level faction members, so the faction won't offer the players resources, support, or information beyond what is required to fulfil any missions they hire them to do. The faction might offer to trade for services and pay the characters in gold rather than grant them boons.": "他们是中立的。也许他们还不认识彼此。该派别愿意以自由职业者的身份雇佣该队伍来帮助实现他们的目标—尤其是那些需要保持距离的互动（比如与另一个派别对抗），但该派别还不信任玩家。他们可能与低级别的派别成员有过一些粗糙的互动，因此该派别不会为玩家提供超出完成雇佣任务所需的资源、支持或信息。该派别可能会提议以服务交换，并用金币支付角色，而不是给予他们好处。",
	"There isn't any trust here. The players show disregard for the faction's objectives. Minor skirmishes may have broken out with low-level faction members. The faction won't let the players use their resources or help. If the players want to repair the relationship, the faction offers the players a chance to complete a mission to demonstrate their commitment, possibly by striking directly at a rival faction. The faction occasionally sends strike teams to impede the party, disrupt their goals, and dissuade them from entering the city. However, these teams don't try to kill the characters. If violence breaks out, these strike teams either knock the characters out to try to capture them, deescalate, or flee.": "这里缺乏信任。玩家们对派系的目标表现出漠视。可能会发生与低级别派系成员的小规模冲突。派系不会让玩家使用他们的资源或寻求帮助。如果玩家想修复关系，派系会给予玩家完成一项任务的机会，以展示他们的承诺，可能是直接打击对手派系。派系偶尔会派遣突击小队阻止玩家，干扰他们的目标，并劝阻他们进入城市。然而，这些小队并不会试图杀死角色。如果发生暴力事件，这些突击小队会将角色击昏，试图擒获他们，缓和局势，或逃离。",
	"The characters have betrayed the faction's trust, murdered its members, and are working against the faction's most important goals in a profound way. The faction actively tries to thwart the characters using its schemes, and sends its deadly strike teams against the the characters.": "这些角色背叛了派系的信任，谋杀了其成员，并且以一种深远的方式违背了派系最重要的目标。派系积极地试图通过其阴谋阻挠这些角色，并派遣致命的突击小组对抗这些角色。",
	"Suffice to say, the Amethyst Academy has developed the means to harness the incredible arcane energies contained within delerium. We shall use it to create unfathomable magical wonders on a scale hitherto undreamt of, for the betterment and protection of all people. Only the Amethyst Academy has the knowledge to accomplish such a feat, and the wisdom to temper the wild and destructive potential of this volatile resource.": "可以说，紫晶学院已经开发出了利用狂乱之中蕴含的不可思议奥术能量的方法。我们将利用它来创造前所未有的难以想象的魔法奇迹，为了所有人的福祉和保护。只有紫晶学院拥有完成这一壮举的知识，以及调和这种易变资源的狂野和破坏潜力的智慧。",
	"The Amethyst Academy is a research institute, educational organization, and mage guild pursuing the arcane mysteries of delerium. The faction is small and outwardly aloof, yet subtly influential and tremendously wealthy. They are led by a shadowy directorate of powerful archmages who dispatched Archwizard {@creature Eldrick Runeweaver|DoDk} to oversee their operations in Drakkenheim. Most of its members are potent arcane spellcasters with access to rare magical resources, but only a handful of agents are active in Drakkenheim.": "紫晶学院是一个研究机构、教育组织和法师公会，致力于探索迪勒里姆的奥秘。该派系规模较小，表面上冷漠，但潜在影响力巨大，财富丰厚。他们由一群强大的大法师组成的神秘董事会领导，派遣大法师{@creature Eldrick Runeweaver|DoDk}监督他们在德拉肯海姆的运作。大多数成员都是强大的奥术施法者，拥有稀有的魔法资源，但在德拉肯海姆只有少数特工活跃。",
	"The Amethyst Academy began as a secret school for young sorcerers during a time when arcane magic faced extreme persecution from the clergy of the Sacred Flame. The mages located children who manifested magical talents, rescued them from their fearful and paranoid communities, and educated them in hidden strongholds and far-away castles so they might wield their abilities with trained and refined control. The secret school gradually grew into a secret society in its own right.": "紫晶学院（Amethyst Academy）起初是一所秘密学校，为年轻巫师提供教育，当时奥术魔法面临着圣焰教廷极端的迫害。这些法师找到了表现出魔法天赋的孩子们，将他们从恐惧和偏执的社区中解救出来，在隐藏的要塞和遥远的城堡中教育他们，让他们能够训练和精细控制自己的能力。这所秘密学校逐渐发展成为一个独立的秘密社会。",
	"Sequestered in unseen universities to hide from the mage-slaying Knights of the Silver Order, the mages pooled their knowledge. They conducted research into arcane and cosmological phenomena, and developed the modern practice of wizardry. Over time, the Amethyst Academy secured allies amongst the nobility by providing them clandestine magical services and occult counsel, crafting enchanted heirlooms, protecting their castles with arcane wards, and teaching their heirs magic.": "在不为人知的大学中隐居，以避开银色骑士团（Knights of the Silver Order）的法师杀手，这些法师汇集了他们的知识。他们进行了对奥术和宇宙现象的研究，并发展出了现代巫术的实践。随着时间的推移，紫晶学院（Amethyst Academy）通过为贵族提供秘密的魔法服务和神秘的咨询，打造魔法传家宝，用奥术结界保护他们的城堡，并教导他们的继承人魔法，获得了贵族们的盟友。",
	"When these schemes were discovered by the Faith of the Sacred Flame, a renewed series of brutal inquisitions and vengeful witch-hunts began. What had been a shadow conflict between paladins and sorcerers for centuries spilled into outright war between noble houses who championed the Faith, and those that supported the Amethyst Academy. These conflicts ended with the {@area Edicts of Lumen|70a|x} (detailed in {@adventure Appendix E|DoDk|14}). Enacted three hundred years ago, this landmark treaty stopped the murderous suppression of arcane magic by the religious ministry, and established a new balance of power between mages, the Faith, and the nobility throughout the continent.": "当这些阴谋被圣焰信仰发现时，一系列新的残酷审讯和复仇性的巫师猎巫行动开始了。几个世纪以来，圣骑士和巫师之间的阴影冲突演变成了支持圣焰信仰的贵族家族与支持紫晶学院的家族之间的全面战争。这些冲突以{@area Edicts of Lumen|70a|x}（详见{@adventure Appendix E|DoDk|14}）结束。这项具有里程碑意义的条约是三百年前颁布的，它阻止了宗教部门对奥术魔法的谋杀性镇压，并在整个大陆的法师、信仰和贵族之间建立了新的权力平衡。",
	"The Edicts of Lumen bestow extensive protections, full autonomy, and economic advantages to the Amethyst Academy, but also require the Academy to observe strict standards of mercantile neutrality and political non-intervention. Most importantly, it grants the Amethyst Academy guardianship of any child who demonstrates magical aptitude until they come of age and master their abilities. In exchange, the agreement stipulates that all arcane spellcasters are disinherited from any land, rank, or titles, including the scions of noble and royal families. Since the Edicts, Academy mages may work magic without fear of oppression from church or state, though the organization remains withdrawn as it increasingly turns its attention to global affairs and extraplanar happenings. However, the direction and focus of the Amethyst Academy has dramatically shifted following the destruction of Drakkenheim, when their greatest stronghold was cut off from them.": "卢梦法令向紫晶学院赋予广泛的保护、完全自治权和经济优势，但也要求学院遵守严格的商业中立和政治不干涉标准。最重要的是，它授予紫晶学院对表现出魔法才能的任何孩子的监护权，直到他们成年并掌握自己的能力。作为交换，协议规定所有奥术施法者被剥夺任何土地、头衔或称号的权利，包括贵族和皇室家族的后裔。自从颁布这些法令以来，学院的法师们可以在不受教会或国家压迫的情况下施展魔法，尽管该组织仍然保持独立，但它越来越将注意力转向全球事务和外部平面事件。然而，自从德拉肯海姆被摧毁后，紫晶学院的方向和重心发生了戏剧性的转变，他们最大的据点被切断了。",
	"While the Amethyst Academy outwardly upholds the Edicts of Lumen, in recent years some have claimed the mages furtively flaunt its restrictions and disregard the terms that forbid dark magical practices.

A set of five or more functions as a {@item ring of spell storing}, and some allow control over a {@creature shield guardian}. However, each set is made for a specific individual, and only that person may attune that set of academy rings.": "紫水晶学院的成员每人佩戴一套由异域奥术金属制成的戒指。佩戴的戒指数量对应着他们能施展的最高等级法术。被称为{@i academy rings}(Amethyst Academy Rings)的这些魔法物品标识着他们是学院的毕业生，并常常允许进入学院的要塞。一套五个或更多的戒指作为{@item ring of spell storing}(Ring of Spell Storing)发挥作用，有些还可以控制{@creature shield guardian}(Ring of Elemental Command)。然而，每套戒指都是为特定个人制作的，只有那个人可以调谐那套学院戒指。",

	"Far away from Drakkenheim in secret laboratories, Amethyst Academy wizards relentlessly research delerium samples recovered from the ruins. Their brilliant minds have crafted potent arcane artefacts and invented mighty new spells powered by the vast energies contained within the crystals. Though the true origin of delerium remains unknown to them, many Academy assets are now dedicated to the study and refinement of delerium. They procure enormous quantities to fuel their esoteric experiments and eldritch industries. Rather than risk their own members' lives in the ruins of Drakkenheim, the Academy usually obtains delerium through various grey market sources, typically by hiring adventurers.": "在距离德拉肯海姆遥远的秘密实验室中，紫晶学院的巫师们不懈地研究从废墟中回收的癫狂症样本。他们卓越的头脑创造了强大的奥术神器，并发明了由这些晶体中蕴含的巨大能量驱动的强大新法术。尽管他们对癫狂症的真正起源一无所知，但许多学院的资源现在都致力于研究和改进癫狂症。他们获取大量晶体来供给他们的神秘实验和神秘产业。紫晶学院通常不愿冒风险让自己的成员在德拉肯海姆的废墟中冒生命危险，而是通过各种灰色市场来源获取癫狂症，通常是通过雇佣冒险者。",
	"The mages do not disregard the dangers presented by delerium's contaminating properties. In fact, it is precisely because of these hazards that the mages believe only they can use the crystals responsibly. Thus, the Academy seeks complete control over this critical resource both to protect the wider world and to secure their magical hegemony for the foreseeable future. However, other factions are now moving to reclaim Drakkenheim and potentially install a new ruling dynasty. Such political upheavals could affect the Academy's ability to research and harvest delerium. The Academy does not want a ruler who will destroy delerium, force the Academy to pay exorbitant sums to obtain it, or impose conditions on how the Academy may use the crystals.": "法师们并不忽视癫狂晶体所带来的危险。事实上，正是因为这些危险，法师们相信只有他们才能负责地使用这些晶体。因此，学院寻求对这一关键资源的完全控制，既是为了保护更广泛的世界，也是为了确保他们在可预见的未来保持魔法霸权。然而，其他派系现在正试图夺回德拉肯海姆，并有可能建立一个新的统治王朝。这种政治动荡可能会影响学院研究和收割癫狂晶体的能力。学院不希望有一个会摧毁癫狂晶体、迫使学院支付巨额费用以获取它、或者对学院使用这些晶体的方式施加条件的统治者。",
	"Ultimately, the Academy has zero interest in seeing Drakkenheim restored and rebuilt, and view this as a folly doomed to fail. Rather, they have an ambitious plan to transform the city ruins into a quarry for their research and industry. Once they fulfil their other goals, the Amethyst Academy wants the other factions to totally abandon Drakkenheim so they can have sole control over the ruins.": "最终，（Amethyst Academy）对于看到德拉肯海姆（Drakkenheim）被恢复和重建没有任何兴趣，并认为这是注定要失败的愚蠢行为。相反，他们有一个雄心勃勃的计划，将这座城市废墟转变为他们研究和工业的采石场。一旦他们实现了其他目标，（Amethyst Academy）希望其他派系完全放弃德拉肯海姆，这样他们就可以独自控制这些废墟。",
	"Drakkenheim was home to one of the Amethyst Academy's most important strongholds: the Inscrutable Tower. This immense structure houses vast repositories of magical lore, incomplete magical experiments, hidden vaults containing unspeakable extraplanar entities, and powerful magic items sheltered from the world at large—all rendered completely inaccessible to the Academy since the meteor fell. The Deep Haze has settled within the tower, scrambling the Academy's own arcane wards and foiling every attempt to enter or observe the Tower using teleportation or divination magic.": "德拉肯海姆（Drakkenheim）是紫晶学院（Amethyst Academy）最重要的据点之一：神秘塔（Inscrutable Tower）。这座巨大的建筑物内设有大量的魔法知识库、未完成的魔法实验、隐藏的保险库，其中藏有无法言说的外域实体，以及强大的魔法物品，这些物品都被完全封锁，紫晶学院自陨石坠落以来无法进入。深雾已经笼罩在塔内，扰乱了学院自身的奥术结界，并挫败了任何试图使用传送或占卜魔法进入或观察塔的尝试。",
	"The mages have already expended considerable effort attempting to retake the Tower on their own. These attempts catastrophically failed. The pragmatic wizards cannot afford to exhaust the Academy's resources in such a fruitless manner any longer, so now they turn to research and patient methods to advance their goals in Drakkenheim. They seek a suitably talented, trustworthy, and expendable adventuring party to conduct survey and recovery missions into the Inscrutable Tower. If the Tower were to be secured and repaired, the Amethyst Academy would have the ideal staging ground to begin the mass industrial exploitation of delerium, and would be able to bring its full resources to bear in Drakkenheim.": "法师们已经付出了相当大的努力，试图独自夺回(`Tower`)。这些尝试以灾难性失败告终。务实的巫师们不能再在这种毫无成果的方式上耗尽学院的资源，因此他们现在转向研究和耐心的方法来推进他们在德拉肯海姆(`Drakkenheim`)的目标。他们寻找一个足够有才华、值得信赖且可以牺牲的冒险队伍，进行对(`Inscrutable Tower`)的勘测和恢复任务。如果(`Tower`)能够被安全地夺回并修复，紫晶学院将拥有理想的基地，开始大规模开发(`delerium`)，并能够全力支持在德拉肯海姆(`Drakkenheim`)的行动。",

	"{@creature Lucretia Mathias|DoDk} was one such Flamekeeper who read omens in the night sky, and was regarded as one of the most learned and wise amongst the clergy.

	"Her visions proved true; right down to the hour. However, even Lucretia Mathias did not expect the actual destruction the meteor would cause, nor did she anticipate it would annihilate her birthplace, Drakkenheim. She spent several years afterwards contemplating the heavens and several strange stones recovered from the city. Her conclusion was dire indeed: the world stands on the precipice of darkness unending. Yet within delerium, she saw the spark of salvation. Though the stones are the stuff of chaos, black charcoal and midnight oil may fuel a great flame. Perhaps if taken up by righteous souls, the crystals might become an earthly vessel for the Sacred Flame itself. Rather than fall to all-consuming shadows, Lucretia Mathias prophesied a New Age of Heroes that could meet the coming night. She spoke widely about her beliefs and discoveries, and her fiery sermons galvanized a throng of loyal supporters who proselytized her new creed across Elyria, Westemär, and Caspia. As her support grew, she resolved to make a pilgrimage to the crater itself to confirm her revelations.": "她的预言被证明是真实的；甚至到了小时候。然而，即使是Lucretia Mathias也没有预料到陨石将造成的实际破坏，也没有预料到它将毁灭她的出生地，德拉肯海姆。之后的几年里，她一直在思考天空和从城市中找到的几块奇怪的石头。她的结论确实令人担忧：世界正处于无尽黑暗的边缘。然而，在狂喜中，她看到了拯救的火花。虽然这些石头是混沌之物，黑炭和午夜油可能会燃起一团巨大的火焰。也许，如果被正直的灵魂接受，这些水晶可能会成为神圣火焰的一个地上容器。Lucretia Mathias预言了一个新的英雄时代，可以迎接即将到来的黑夜，而不是沦陷于吞噬一切的阴影之中。她广泛地宣扬自己的信仰和发现，她热情洋溢的布道激励了一群忠实的支持者，他们在厄利亚、韦斯特马和卡斯皮亚传教她的新信条。随着支持者的增加，她决定朝着陨石坑本身进行朝圣，以确认她的启示。",
	"Meanwhile, the mainstream clergy reacted to delerium with disgust and horror. When Lucretia Mathias returned from her pilgrimage bearing a {@adventure delerium crystal|DoDk|13|Delerium} embedded in her own body, she was declared a heretic and excommunicated. However, she refused to be silenced. Escaping Elyria, she expanded her original writings and published them as the {@i Testament of the Falling Fire}.

Their holy missions transcend sovereign borders, but the order is headquartered in the Holy City of Lumen in Elyria.": "几个世纪前，白银骑士团(The Silver Order)作为神圣火焰信仰的武装力量而成立。这些骑士和圣骑士们奉圣母的命令，保护信徒免受恶魔和怪物的侵害，当误入歧途的法师涉足禁忌魔法时，他们会被召集为猎巫者。他们的神圣使命超越了国界，但骑士团的总部设在埃尔利亚的圣光之城(Lumen)。",
	"Paladins are revered figures in the Faith of the Sacred Flame, as the founder of the faith was herself a paladin. Though not every warrior in the Silver Order is a paladin, each strives to emulate Saint Tarna's valiant example. Though they usually operate as individual questing knights or in small warrior-companies, occasionally they are deployed as a regiment. Members of the Silver Order have been traditionally drawn from all peoples and all levels of society. {@creature Noble||Nobles} and {@creature Commoner||commoners} are found within the Order, and one's station in life does not reflect one's position in the Order.": "圣焰信仰中的圣武士备受尊崇，因为该信仰的创始人本身就是一名圣武士。尽管银色骑士团中并非每位战士都是圣武士，但每个人都努力效仿塔尔娜圣女的英勇榜样。他们通常作为独立的探险骑士或小型战士团队行动，偶尔也会作为一个团队出征。银色骑士团的成员传统上来自各个民族和社会各个阶层。{@creature Noble||Nobles} 和 {@creature Commoner||commoners} 在团中都有，一个人的社会地位并不代表在团中的地位。",
	"In their role as witch-hunters and mage-slayers, the Silver Order was complicit in the persecution and oppression of arcane spellcasters. To this day, the issue remains a deep stain on the order's honour, as many observed that the injustices and persecution visited upon spellcasters stand in stark contrast against the tenets of the faith of the Sacred Flame, a faith that calls out for justice for the oppressed. Nevertheless, staunch supporters of the Silver Order argue that their deeds were indeed justified. Decisive action is necessary to defend the innocent and the faithful from wicked sorcerers who sought to dominate others with magical might, or cut down foul warlocks who spread wickedness through demonology and necromancy. The chronicle of the Silver Order records countless heroic missions that have prevented a dire threat from growing into a far greater crisis.": "在他们作为猎巫者和法师杀手的角色中，白银骑士团（Silver Order）在迫害和压制奥术施法者方面是有罪的。直到今天，这个问题仍然是该团荣誉上的深重污点，因为许多人注意到，对施法者的不公和迫害与圣焰教（Sacred Flame）信仰的原则形成了鲜明对比，这个信仰呼吁为受压迫者伸张正义。然而，白银骑士团的坚定支持者认为他们的行为是正当的。果断行动是必要的，以保护无辜者和信徒免受那些试图用魔法力量统治他人的邪恶巫师，或者铲除通过恶魔学和死灵术传播邪恶的邪恶术士。白银骑士团的编年史记录了无数英勇使命，阻止了一场严重威胁演变成更大危机的发生。",
	"The Silver Order answers to the Faith of the Sacred Flame, not to the command of any sovereign nation. However, the Order remains strongly connected to its roots, and most of its members hail from Elyria. Ever since the realm of Elyriacame under the de facto rule of the religious ministry, the order has become increasingly entangled in state affairs. Their knights have been deployed on inquisitional crusades against heretics, heathens, and other political enemies of the Sacred Flame. The distinction between an \"enemy of the Sacred Flame\" and an \"enemy of Elyria\" is not entirely clear anymore. As such, some worry the Order's presence in Drakkenheim is an invasive ploy by Elyria to wrest control of Westemär, rather than a righteous expedition to purify the city of eldritch contamination.": "白银骑士团（The Silver Order）效忠于神圣之焰信仰（Faith of the Sacred Flame），而非任何主权国家的命令。然而，该骑士团仍然与其根源紧密相连，大多数成员来自厄利亚（Elyria）。自从厄利亚领地事实上落入宗教部门统治之下以来，该骑士团越来越卷入国家事务之中。他们的骑士被派往对异端、异教徒和其他神圣之焰的政治敌人进行审讯式的十字军圣战。\"神圣之焰的敌人\"和\"厄利亚的敌人\"之间的区别不再那么明显。因此，一些人担心骑士团在德拉肯海姆（Drakkenheim）的存在是厄利亚为了控制维斯泰马（Westemär）而进行的入侵策略，而不是一次正义的远征，以净化这座城市的邪术污染。",

	"Two decades ago, Emberwood Village was little more than a farmers market, blacksmith, a pub, a small chapel and a few dozen cottages. The local businesses served the farmlands and logging camps surrounding the capital, and the town was an occasional rest stop for merchants to stop off on their way to Drakkenheim.": "二十年前，(Emberwood Village)艾伯伍德村只不过是一个农贸市场、铁匠铺、一家酒吧、一座小教堂和几十间小屋。当地的商家为首都周围的农田和伐木营地提供服务，这个小镇偶尔也是商人在前往(Drakkenheim)德拉肯海姆途中的一个休息站。",
	"As the town lies some five miles south of the capital city, it was not directly damaged by the meteor shower, though the impact shattered the windows of every building, caused some weaker structures to collapse, and left some in the village {@condition blinded} or {@condition deafened}.

	"Drakkenheim was a grandiose capital city famous for its many architectural wonders. The even-handed rule of House von Kessel fostered a vibrant and industrious spirit that welcomed folk throughout the realm and beyond, and the city was an international hub for trade and culture. Nearly a hundred thousand people called Drakkenheim home, and thousands more lived in small villages and hamlets a few days travel from the city. Only a few hundred people survived the cataclysm that devastated the city, and the folk who lived in the surrounding countryside have abandoned the area for safer regions.": "德拉肯海姆（Drakkenheim）是一个宏伟的首都，以其众多建筑奇迹而闻名。凯瑟尔伯爵家族（House von Kessel）的公正统治培育了一个充满活力和勤劳精神的社会，欢迎来自王国内外的人们，这座城市是国际贸易和文化的中心。将近十万人称德拉肯海姆为家，还有成千上万人居住在距离城市几天路程的小村庄和聚落中。只有几百人幸存了摧毁这座城市的灾难，而居住在周边乡村的人们已经放弃这个地区，转移到更安全的地方。",
	"The recorded history of Drakkenheim stretches back about six hundred years, but a settlement and fortification have stood here since antiquity. The city was named after its founders, the now-extinct House von Drakken. Four distinct dynasties have ruled the city since, with House von Kessel claiming the throne one hundred fifty years ago.": "德拉肯海姆（Drakkenheim）的记载历史可追溯到大约六百年前，但自古以来，这里就有一个定居点和要塞。这座城市以其创始人、现已灭绝的德拉肯家族（House von Drakken）命名。自那时以来，已有四个不同的王朝统治过这座城市，其中军队家族（House von Kessel）一百五十年前夺得王位。",

	"Five major highways lead to Drakkenheim. The roads transition into the city's main streets: King's Road, Temple Road, Shepherd's Way, Champion's Way, and College Street. Each passes through a correspondingly-named gate, and ranges from twenty to forty feet wide with broad sidewalks along either side. Wrought-iron lamp posts and sewer drains are placed throughout. They converge at Market Square. Elsewhere in the city, the common cobblestone-paved roads are twelve to eighteen feet wide. Most have a narrow two-foot wide brick sidewalk. Sidestreets are often no more than ten feet wide, and in other areas only a narrow alley separates the buildings. In the outer city slums, many roads are merely gravel-covered or raw dirt, though there are some stone-paved streets.": "五条主要高速公路通往德拉肯海姆。这些道路过渡到城市的主要街道：国王大道(King's Road)，神殿路(Temple Road)，牧羊人之路(Shepherd's Way)，冠军之路(Champion's Way)和学院街(College Street)。每条道路都经过一个同名的城门，宽度从二十到四十英尺不等，两侧都有宽阔的人行道。铁艺路灯和下水道排水沟遍布其中。它们在市场广场汇聚。在城市的其他地方，普通的鹅卵石铺就的道路宽度为十二到十八英尺。大多数道路都有一个窄窄的两英尺宽的砖铺人行道。小巷往往不超过十英尺宽，在其他地区，只有一条狭窄的小巷分隔建筑物。在城市外围的贫民窟，许多道路仅是覆盖着碎石或裸露的泥土，尽管也有一些铺着石头的街道。",
	"Drakkenheim is a city of stone buildings and slate spires. Many in the Inner City may be three or four storeys tall, sometimes taller. Most are tightly packed townhouses built on stone ground levels, although the upper levels are often made from wood, and boast fine glass windows and sturdy chimneys. Wealthier homes even feature indoor plumbing directly connected to the city's water system. Dozens of smaller chapel domes and spires mark distinct boroughs in the city. In contrast, the outer city is mostly a ramshackle slum consisting of crumbling tenements, wattle and daub cottages, and fieldstone shacks. However, the northern estates and the sections along major roads boast fine construction similar to that of the inner city.": "德拉肯海姆(Drakkenheim)是一个由石头建筑和板岩尖塔构成的城市。内城的许多建筑可能有三到四层高，有时甚至更高。大多数是紧密排列的联排别墅，建在石头地面上，尽管上层通常是用木头建造的，拥有精美的玻璃窗户和坚固的烟囱。更富裕的住宅甚至配备了直接连接到城市供水系统的室内管道。城市中有许多较小的教堂圆顶和尖塔标志着不同的行政区。相比之下，外城主要是一个摇摇欲坠的贫民窟，由摇篮和泥巴小屋以及粗石板棚构成。然而，北部庄园和沿主要道路的区域的建筑质量与内城相似。",

	"Drakkenheim is dangerous and unpredictable. There is no such thing as a foolproof plan for safely exploring the ruins.

Ever since the Queen of Thieves brought the gangs under her influence, the street has been controlled by the Queen's Men: bandits and brigands meet here on neutral ground, join in revelry together, trade with fences and smugglers, and only occasionally slit each other's throats. There's few rules and even less order. Flowing ale and gold tend to calm the most violent disputes, but for anything else the hidden fighting pit is the perfect place to settle feuds, make some bets, and lose a few teeth.": "这一排臭名昭著的酒吧和肮脏的酒馆位于德拉肯海姆东南郊。几十年前，这些地方是下层劳工、汗湿的手工艺人和各种歹徒的首选聚集地。如今，巴克尔顿巷成为了歹徒、被放逐者、拾荒者等的聚集地。这些酒馆大多保存完好，靠近城镇边缘，方便一群粗暴的恶棍前来，但又远离城市中心，阻止其他人跟随。自从盗贼女王控制了这些帮派以来，这条街道一直由女王的手下控制：强盗和土匪在这里会面，共同狂欢，与贼赃贩子交易，只偶尔互相残杀。这里几乎没有规则，更缺乏秩序。畅饮的啤酒和金子通常能平息最激烈的争端，但对于其他事情来说，隐藏的搏斗场是解决纠纷、下注和掉几颗牙的完美场所。",
	"On the surface, Buckledown Row might appear to be the stronghold for the Queen's Men in Drakkenheim. It's certainly a gathering point for the gangs and a hub for illicit activity, and the characters just might be able to make contact with the Queen of Thieves here. Alternatively, they might just want to crack some skulls in the fighting ring!": "表面上看，(Drakkenheim)中的(女王之人)可能会认为(Buckledown Row)是他们的据点。这里无疑是各帮派的聚集地和非法活动的中心，角色们可能会在这里与(盗贼女王)取得联系。或者，他们可能只是想在搏斗场中打破一些头颅！",
	"The Queen of Thieves makes an appearance in Buckledown Row, usually appearing for a few hours on a Friday or Saturday evening to watch the best fights.": "盗贼女王在(Buckledown Row)出现，通常会在周五或周六晚上出现几个小时，观看最精彩的战斗。",
	"The bandits that fill the streets and taverns might not notice strangers, but also are not afraid to stab or steal from anyone who seems like they don't belong.": "在街道和酒馆里到处都是强盗，他们可能不会注意到陌生人，但也不会害怕刺伤或从任何看起来不属于他们的人身上偷东西。",
	"Asking around the taverns and streets, it's easy to gather that the fighting pits below the taverns are the way people around here get known. Many of the fighters in the pits are renowned legends amongst the gangs. Anyone who can defeat the other fighters gets to take a crack at the Queen's champion in the royal fighting pits. Beat the champion, and you get a private audience with the Queen.": "在酒馆和街头打听，很容易得知，在这里，人们通过地下酒馆的搏斗场来出名。搏斗场里的许多斗士都是各帮派中著名的传奇人物。任何能打败其他斗士的人都有机会挑战皇家搏斗场的女王冠军。战胜冠军，就能获得与女王私下会面的机会。",
	"The five taverns in Buckledown Row are all filled with various gangs of the Queen's Men. Around every corner is gambling, cards, dice, and occasionally people brawling openly in the streets. A body being thrown out a window, or the sound of shattering glass or splintering wood are so common that they become almost part of the backdrop of the place. Everyone here is a little rough around the edges and if you stick out too much you'll draw a lot of unwanted attention.": "在Buckledown Row的五家酒馆里，都挤满了女王卫队的各种帮派。每个角落都有赌博、打牌、掷骰子，偶尔还会有人在街上公然厮打。有人被从窗户扔出去的尸体，或者玻璃破裂和木头碎裂的声音是如此之常见，以至于几乎成为这个地方的背景之一。这里的每个人都有点粗糙，如果你显得太过起眼，就会招来很多不必要的注意。",
	"Consult the {@area Outlaws and Scoundrels|183|x} from the {@area Queen's Men Dossier|16e|x} for some of the symbols and characters to fill out the taverns. The gangs all mingle here but usually each gang has a preferred tavern that their leader can be found in, and a few characteristics to help bring any NPCs to life.": "请向{@area Queen's Men Dossier|16e|x}的{@area Outlaws and Scoundrels|183|x}咨询一些符号和字符，以填写酒馆。各个帮派都在这里交际，但通常每个帮派都有一个首领常出没的首选酒馆，并有一些特征可以帮助塑造任何NPC的形象。",
	"If the party manages to fit in without drawing unwanted attention, the gangs pay them no mind above anyone else. The gangs are gaining so many members that if you are in Buckledown Row, most assume you ought to be there. Discussing other factions, or any plans or adventures that seem suspicious, might arouse the attention of people nearby. Also if the party is acting awkward or nervous, this may draw attention - it may also help their cause to dress in appropriate gang attire or to have symbols of a gang on their gear. Again, the {@area Outlaws and Scoundrels|183|x} detailed in the {@area Queen's Men Dossier|16e|x} can provide information the party might gather to help them disguise themselves or hatch a plan to fit in. If the party openly approaches a gang leader without invitation, they may gain some attention as well, but most of the leaders are eager to hear out anyone bold enough to approach them and will engage with the party in amused curiosity. Otherwise the gangs accept the characters as more new recruits and try and encourage them with drinking, games, sometimes a fight, or a game of cards. Or maybe trying to push them to join the fighting pits below.": "如果队伍成功融入环境而不引起不必要的注意，帮派们会对他们不予理睬，就像对其他人一样。帮派的成员越来越多，以至于在Buckledown Row，大多数人都会认为你应该在那里。讨论其他派别，或者任何看起来可疑的计划或冒险，可能会引起附近人们的注意。此外，如果队伍表现得尴尬或紧张，这可能会引起注意 - 穿上适当的帮派服装或在装备上带有帮派符号可能有助于他们的目的。同样，{@area Outlaws and Scoundrels|183|x}中提到的{@area Queen's Men Dossier|16e|x}中的详细信息可以提供一些信息，帮助队伍伪装自己或制定融入计划。如果队伍未经邀请就公开接近一个帮派领袖，他们也可能引起一些注意，但大多数领袖都渴望倾听任何足够大胆接近他们的人，并会以好奇心与队伍互动。否则，帮派会将角色视为新的招募，并尝试用饮酒、游戏、有时是一场战斗或一局牌来鼓励他们。或者也许试图推动他们加入地下的搏斗场。",
	"Roughshod fences and makeshift barricades block off this muddy street of ramshackle taverns. Crudely made bridges stretch between the rooftops, and crooked street lamps glow brightly in the mists. Laughter, cheering, and a general uproar echo down the alleys from a motley assortment of thugs, ruffians, cutthroats, and scoundrels who drink, gamble, and traffic down the street. Keen-eyed sharpshooters look down from the lookout posts, and a pair of muscled bruisers stand watch outside the ramparts.": "粗糙的篱笆和临时路障挡住了这条泥泞的街道，两旁是摇摇欲坠的小酒馆。粗制的桥梁横跨屋顶，歪斜的街灯在薄雾中闪耀。笑声、欢呼声和一片混乱的喧嚣从小巷中传来，一群暴徒、流氓、刺客和恶棍们在街上喝酒、赌博和交易。瞭望塔上的狙击手注视着四周，一对强壮的打手在城墙外放哨。",
	"At any time, 21 ({@dice 6d6}) {@creature Bandit||bandits} stroll the streets, and 5 ({@dice 2d4}) {@creature Scoundrel|DoDk|scoundrels} lurk upon the rooftops.

	"An ancient moss-covered fieldstone well rests on a terrace behind one of the taverns. Upon a skeleton nailed to a gnarled tree nearby is a crudely-painted sign that reads \"Make a Wish\". Peering down the well reveals an impenetrable gloom.": "一个古老长满青苔的石井坐落在一家酒馆后面的一个平台上。附近一棵扭曲的树上钉着一个骷髅，上面挂着一个粗糙绘制的牌子，上面写着“许个愿望”。往井里望去，只见一片深不可测的黑暗。",
	"Each week, representatives from each of the hundred gangs of the Queen's Men deposit their tribute to the Queen of Thieves here by dropping a marked satchel of gold or gems down the well. Each outfit pays a sum of 100 gold or more, depending on their arrangements with the Queen.": "每周，女王的百个帮派的代表们通过往井里投放标记过的金子或宝石来向盗贼女王献上贡品。每个团伙支付100金币或更多的金额，取决于他们与女王的安排。",
	"The gangs don't know what happens afterwards, but the Queen always knows when someone misses a payment.": "这些帮派不知道之后会发生什么，但女王(`the Queen`)总是知道有人未按时付款。",
	"The bottom of the well is concealed by a permanent {@spell major image} and a silent {@spell alarm} spell, but their magic has been hidden with the {@spell Nystul's Magic Aura||arcanist's magic aura} spell.

The door is missing and the wall where the entrance was has been blasted away to leave just a gaping hole that people come and go through. No signage seems to exist but in the large window next to the blasted entrance is the cook of the place. There is a smoking grill where a large bugbear named Brian is cooking some charred-looking meat; he is wet with sweat caused by the heat of the grill. Baskerville, the leader of the Howlin' Dogs gang, sits at a table in the corner with cushioned seats, a bottle of mead in hand and talking with some scary-looking thieves. There is a game of knife throwing happening in the back. There also seems to be a gnome in a top hat strapped to the target they are throwing knives at.": "这家破旧的小酒馆简直就像是一堵潮湿的墙壁上的一个洞。几乎就是字面意义上。门不见了，入口处的墙壁被炸开，只留下一个巨大的洞口供人出入。没有任何招牌存在，但在被炸开的入口旁边的大窗户里，是这个地方的厨师。那里有一个冒着烟的烤架，一个名叫布莱恩的大熊人正在烹饪一些看起来烤焦了的肉；他被烤架的热量搞得浑身湿透。霍林狗帮的头目巴斯克维尔坐在角落里的一张带有软垫的座位上，手里拿着一瓶蜜酒，正在和一些看起来吓人的贼人交谈。后面正在进行一场投掷刀的游戏。还有一个穿着高顶礼帽的侏儒被绑在他们投掷刀的目标上。",

	"Baskerville is amused by anyone coming to talk to him and listens to whatever they have to say. However if it doesn't involve smashing, killing, or getting rich, he laughs at the intrusion and waves them away.

	"A large neon-painted sign of a ram skull with swirling designs and patterns inside it is posted on the front of this old building. It's three storeys high and has balconies all along the top two floors, with a large wooden door that has a cobra motif on it. Inside the tavern there are several small private booths with tables and seating for four to six people. At the far end of the tavern is a small stage where some rough looking scoundrels are playing instruments and riling the place up. A long bar along one side has a row of red-velvet-topped stools contrasting against the dark almost black wood of the bar. A dwarf woman behind the bar named Reeda Blackstone is polishing glasses. She is friendly, kind-hearted, and welcoming to any who come through the door. Everyone who orders a drink from her tips her one gold and says \"Thank you Reeda.\" Above the bar is a wall of swords and daggers, all stuck in place in an array of metal and leather. The entire wall is just thousands of blades. Sitting at the end of the bar is Veronica Venom and her gang.": "这座老建筑的正面挂着一个巨大的霓虹灯标志，上面绘有一个羊头骨，内部有纷繁复杂的设计和图案。建筑有三层高，前两层顶部都有阳台，大门上有一个眼镜蛇图案。酒馆内有几个小包间，每个包间都有桌子和四到六个座位。酒馆的远端有一个小舞台，一些粗鲁的恶棍在那里演奏乐器，搞得现场热闹非凡。一侧有一长条吧台，上面排着一排红丝绒顶部的凳子，与几乎黑色的木吧台形成鲜明对比。吧台后面是一位名叫雷达·布莱克斯通(Reeda Blackstone)的矮人女子，正在擦拭玻璃杯。她友善、善良，对所有进门的人都很热情。每个向她点酒的人都会给她一枚金币，并说“谢谢雷达”。吧台上方是一面刀剑和匕首墙，所有的武器都被固定在那里，由金属和皮革组成。整面墙上满是成千上万的刀剑。坐在吧台尽头的是维罗尼卡·毒蛇(Veronica Venom)和她的团伙。",

If the characters don't smooth-talk their way out, there could be blood.": "如果角色在Reeda那里点餐却不给她一枚金币小费，或者不说“谢谢你，Reeda”，她会抓住他们并问：“亲，你是新来镇上的吗？你看起来有点迷茫。”然后示意Veronica过来。这通常会吸引酒馆里所有人的注意。如果角色不能巧妙地摆脱，可能会引发冲突。",
	"Veronica ignores anyone who approaches her that she didn't invite. If she notices anyone who looks stealthy and like they have a killer instinct, she may ask one of her gang members to go invite that character and that character alone over.

And although two stories tall, there is no upstairs save for a small balcony and a spiral staircase going up to it. A man sits up on the balcony in an animal fur coat with a large purple mohawk. The tavern is filled with leather clad bandits with spike studded armour and chains hanging from all over their gear. There is a lot of hollering and it seems a fight is breaking out every couple minutes somewhere in the place. There is a small corner bar with a shelf of various bottles of alcohol spanning both storeys from floor to ceiling. A long rickety ladder transcends the shelves on a wheeled system so it can slide back and forth across the many types of alcohol. Three goblins work the bar. One on the ladder, the other below catching and tossing bottles, and one making the drinks and sliding them down the bar to whoever catches them. People don't seem to ask questions, the goblins seem to make whatever mix of booze suits them and toss it down the bar to whoever catches it.

	"\"Just as one cannot make a mast from a thousand saplings, a thousand small shards of delerium are nothing compared to a single large geode. Bigger crystals contain exponentially more arcane power. Fracturing the rock is a wasteful endeavor, as it causes valuable samples to lose their great magical potential. Delerium crystals and geodes are ideally suited for great spells and ambitious magical constructions. However, it has been difficult to find these specimens in the outer ruins. Nevertheless, small twigs are good for kindling, to set a fire, to keep one warm... and so the small shards make excellent alchemical reagents and arcane inks.\"": "“就像不能用一千株树苗造一根桅杆一样，一千小块狂乱碎片相比于一颗大晶石微不足道。更大的晶石蕴含着指数倍的奥术能量。破碎岩石是一种浪费，因为它会导致宝贵的样本失去巨大的魔法潜力。狂乱晶石和晶石是理想的用于强大咒语和雄心勃勃的魔法建筑。然而，在外部废墟中很难找到这些标本。尽管如此，小树枝适合点火，取暖...因此小碎片非常适合作为炼金材料和奥术墨水。”",
	"\"The warping effects of delerium have caused new plants and animals to flourish in the city. A half-mad straggler returned from Queen's Park bearing a wondrous flower - an eldritch lily.

He won't act on these plans until he obtains eldritch lilies, and tries to convince characters to bring him more delerium and other resources, citing the needs for it to further his own work. In truth, he starts using these items to conjure demons, create undead, and conspire against the characters.": "如果奥斯卡·约伦幸存下来，但被人物袭击或虐待（或后来发现他们欺骗了他），他会密谋报复。他不会立即采取行动，直到获得了eldritch lilies，然后试图说服人物们给他带来更多delirium和其他资源，声称这些资源对推动他自己的工作至关重要。事实上，他开始使用这些物品召唤恶魔，制造不死生物，并密谋反对人物。",

However, the Ironhelms have since acquired new weaponry, and no longer feel they need to pay such a large cut for protection that has never actually materialised. The Queen of Thieves is furious, and charges the characters with stealing, sabotaging, or destroying the dwarves' gunpowder weapons to make sure they'll have to depend on her services.

He charges the characters to convince the Ironhelms to abandon Drakkenheim. If they refuse, the characters must do what is necessary to drive them out: perhaps by destroying their supplies, the smithy fortifications and weapons, or even somehow making the Scar too dangerous for the dwarves to continue mining it.

Worse, the dwarves have killed several Falling Fire pilgrims who came to the Scar seeking delerium, as the devotees stubbornly refused to back down when threatened by the Ironhelms. Unfortunately, the dwarven guns are simply too much for their pilgrims to overcome on their own, and so the Followers of the Falling Fire need the player characters to be their instrument of wrath.": "落火信徒对矮人露天矿感到震惊，并希望整个作业停止。疯狂之痕必须被用于神圣目的。更糟糕的是，矮人已经杀死了几名前来疯狂之痕寻找疯狂之痕的落火朝圣者，因为信徒们在被铁盔军威胁时顽固地拒绝退缩。不幸的是，矮人的火器对他们的朝圣者来说实在太过强大，因此落火信徒需要玩家角色成为他们的愤怒工具。",

	"If the dwarven mining operations are extensively sabotaged, the Ironhelm siblings are financially ruined. The cost of buying new equipment, hiring new labourers, and building new defenses is simply too much to bear. Combined with the threat of further retribution from another faction, this is sufficient to convince them to leave.": "如果矮人的采矿行动遭到广泛破坏，那么铁盔兄弟姐妹们将面临财务破产。购买新设备、雇佣新劳工和建造新防御工事的成本实在是难以承受。再加上另一个派系可能发起的进一步报复威胁，这足以说服他们离开。",

The next time the characters arrive, a strike team from a rival faction is on site as additional muscle.": "然而，如果矮人们似乎能够恢复或修复玩家角色造成的任何损害，他们可能会寻求另一个派系的帮助，以保护他们免受未来的攻击。下次角色到达时，来自敌对派系的突击小队将在现场作为额外的支援力量。",
	"Should the characters decide to simply slay the dwarves, they're in for a bloody battle. If the tide of battle turns against them, Reginald and Elouise contact their siblings outside Drakkenheim via a {@spell sending} spell. Since the dwarves work in two shifts, the characters will have to deal with both groups. If one group is slain, the other does not exact immediate vengeance - instead, the survivors seek out help from the Hooded Lanterns, the Amethyst Academy, or the Queen of Thieves. Each faction is more than willing to send a strike team of their own to help the Ironhelm dwarves.": "如果角色决定简单地屠杀矮人，他们将卷入一场血腥的战斗。如果战斗的局势对他们不利，雷金纳德(Reginald)和埃洛伊丝(Elouise)通过{@spell sending}咒语联系他们在德拉肯海姆(Drakkenheim)外的兄弟姐妹。由于矮人分两班工作，角色们将不得不应对两组敌人。如果一组被杀，另一组不会立即报复 - 而是幸存者会寻求来自披风灯笼会(Hooded Lanterns)、紫晶学院(Amethyst Academy)或盗贼女王(Queen of Thieves)的帮助。每个派系都乐意派遣自己的突击小队来帮助铁盔矮人。",

	"The major bridges spanning the Drann River are all located within the Inner City. Before Drakkenheim was destroyed, crossing the river via these bridges required merchants and travellers to pay the gate tax to enter the city proper, or otherwise make a detour fifteen miles south or west to other river crossings. During this time, an old boatman named Pixis Stick made his living illicitly ferrying folk across the Drann River on the southern side of town using his rowboat. Often simply called the \"Ferryman\", he enjoyed meeting the urchins and ne'er-do-wells who inhabited Drakkenheim, and swapping stories and gossip with penny-pinching merchants.": "跨越德兰河的主要桥梁都位于内城。在德拉肯海姆被摧毁之前，通过这些桥梁跨越河流需要商人和旅行者支付门税才能进入市区，否则就需要绕道南边或西边十五英里到其他河流渡口。在那段时间里，一位名叫皮克西斯·斯蒂克（Pixis Stick）的老船夫在城镇南部用他的划艇非法地为人们渡过德兰河谋生。他经常被简单地称为“渡船老头”，喜欢与居住在德拉肯海姆的顽童和不法之徒交流，并与吝啬的商人分享故事和八卦。",
	"When the meteor fell, the Ferryman became a {@creature haze husk|DoDk}, one of the tortured and mindless undead creatures that drift aimlessly about the city. However, he retained a strange semblance of his past memory, and is not hostile to passersby.

He now only communicates in low moans and grunts, but the Ferryman still seems to enjoy company, conversation, and of course, gold.": "当陨石坠落时，渡船夫成为了{@creature haze husk|DoDk}，成为了在城市中漂泊无目的的受折磨和无意识的不死生物之一。然而，他保留了过去记忆的奇怪影像，并且并不对过路人敌意。相反，渡船夫像在生前一样，接载乘客来回穿梭于德兰河上。他现在只用低沉的呻吟和咕哝来交流，但渡船夫似乎仍然喜欢有人陪伴、交谈，当然还有金子。",

	"The Ferryman inexplicably rows up to the water's edge whenever characters arrive at either bank of the river on the southwest outskirts of Drakkenheim. If the characters approach him, the Ferryman grunts, gestures to his boat, and holds out his hand. He waits until each person who enters his rowboat gives him anything resembling a gold piece. Once every passenger has paid their fare, the Ferryman takes them across the water. He only transports characters to the opposite side of the river, and cannot be commanded to do anything else. He growls if someone else tries to take the oars from him, and only fights to defend himself or protect his boat.": "每当角色抵达德拉肯海姆西南郊的河岸时，渡船夫会莫名其妙地划到水边。如果角色走近他，渡船夫会咕哝着、指向自己的船，并伸出手。他会等待每位登上他的划船的人给他类似金币的东西。一旦每位乘客都支付了船费，渡船夫就会把他们送过河。他只会把角色运送到河的对岸，不能被命令做其他事情。如果有人试图夺桨，他会咆哮，并只会为了自卫或保护自己的船而战斗。",
	"When alone, the Ferryman mindlessly returns to his old stash to hide his gold. He keeps a duck-shaped buoy in the middle of the river, which connects to several ropes attached to sacks of gold hidden below the water. All told, the Ferryman's treasure consists of 2,374 gold pieces placed in about a dozen satchels.": "当独自一人时，渡船夫会不假思索地返回到他的旧藏身处，将他的金藏起来。他在河中间放了一个鸭子形状的浮标，连接着几根系着藏金袋的绳子，这些藏金袋隐藏在水下。总共，渡船夫的财宝包括 2,374 金币，放在大约十几个小包里。",

	"Characters should reach at least 5th or 6th level before they attempt getting over the city walls.

	"The Hooded Lanterns have tried on multiple occasions to push back the garmyr, but the Lord of the Feast has proven a formidable foe. Lord Commander Elias Drexel is open to working with the Silver Order on a joint operation, and proposes a pincer strike with the Hooded Lanterns working inside the city, and the Silver Order engaging in a frontal assault.

He knows the Silver Order are keen to destroy delerium, which is a problem for the Academy. However, he's doubtful destroying all the delerium in the city is even possible, so he wants to know if the Silver Order has an ace-in-the-hole.

	"Lucretia Mathias is concerned about the Silver Order's plan, and doesn't want them to gain a footing so close to her flock. She foresees the Silver Order will use this momentum to force a war on the Falling Fire and attempt to drive them from the city as if they were no better than the garmyr. Lucretia wants to find a way to prevent the Silver Order from taking the gate, and instead have the characters lure the Lord of The Feast out of the cathedral and into open war with the Silver Order. This may give them time to claim the cathedral for themselves while the two forces whittle each other down.": "卢克莱蒂亚·马西亚斯（Lucretia Mathias）对银色骑士团的计划感到担忧，她不希望他们在她的群众附近站稳脚跟。她预见到银色骑士团会利用这股势头，强迫与“陨落之火”开战，并试图将他们驱逐出城市，就像他们不比加米尔（garmyr）好一样。卢克莱蒂亚希望找到一种方法阻止银色骑士团夺取城门，而是让角色们引诱“盛宴之主”（Lord of The Feast）走出大教堂，与银色骑士团开战。这样一来，他们就有时间夺取大教堂，而这两股力量会相互削弱。",
	"Many adventurers think they can take the 'easy' way into the city by going over the walls...Funny enough I never see them come back that way...or come back at all.": "许多冒险者认为他们可以通过爬墙这种“简单”方式进入城市...有趣的是，我从来没有看到他们那样回来过...或者干脆就是再也没有回来过。",
	"The characters can participate in the battle of Temple Gate in any way they choose, regardless of their alliances.

	"The force at the gate consists of 100 {@creature Gnoll||garmyr} and their {@creature chimera}. They have sentries on the walls armed with crossbows, and two ballistas atop each tower always manned by several garmyr.

	"Lucretia Mathias needs to make it to the cathedral before the Silver Order does, and pushes the matter on the characters if they are allies.

	"Perhaps the events did not go well, or perhaps the player characters found themselves opposed to the Silver Order's goals. If the Silver Order fails to take the gate, the Lord of the Feast claims the victory, putting many Silver Order knights on a gruesome display hanging over the city gate. The Silver Order maintain their position in Camp Dawn, but unless aided by the characters, fail to gain a footing in the city.

	"The Cosmological Clocktower is built on the Market Square Plaza at the heart of Drakkenheim. Created at the behest of an eccentric monarch, this mechanical wonder mysteriously stopped one hundred eleven years ago, and its function as a public belltower was replaced by Saint Vitruvio's Cathedral. Many early expedition teams into the ruins used the clocktower as a landmark and bivouac; remarkably the tower attic lies just above the Haze. Yet the highest spires of Drakkenheim are no safer than the streets below, especially since a bloodthirsty flock of harpies took to roost in the tower.": "宇宙钟楼建在德拉肯海姆市场广场中心。这座机械奇迹是根据一位古怪君主的要求建造的，神秘地在一百一十一年前停止运转，其作为公共钟楼的功能被圣维特鲁维奥大教堂取代。许多最早进入废墟的探险队将这座钟楼作为地标和临时营地；令人惊讶的是，钟楼的阁楼就在迷雾之上。然而，德拉肯海姆最高的尖塔并不比下面的街道更安全，尤其是自从一群嗜血的鹰身女妖开始在钟楼栖息以来。",

	"A long-standing rumour holds that the Cosmological Clocktower is one of the few \"safe\" places to rest within Drakkenheim. These rumours are indeed true: the tower attic juts out just above the Haze, thus the area is a safe place for characters to take a long rest. Every faction leader knows the value of the clocktower as a base of operations within the city. Once the characters begin developing a positive and collaborative relationship with any faction leader, they'll suggest the characters claim it from the vicious harpies who dwell there.": "有一个长期存在的传言称，宇宙钟楼是在德拉肯海姆中少数“安全”的休息地之一。这些传言确实是真的：钟楼的阁楼突出在雾气之上，因此这个区域是角色们安全休息的地方。每个派系领袖都知道钟楼作为城市内行动基地的价值。一旦角色开始与任何派系领袖建立积极合作关系，他们会建议角色们从那里栖息的凶猛的鹰身女妖那里夺取它。",
	"It's unknown if these harpies were the result of strange mutations wrought upon birds or humans, perhaps both are true. Nevertheless these capricious, cruel, and territorial monsters have little interest in bargaining or negotiations.

Scattered across the plaza are the remains of Drakkenheim's central open air market: rows of stalls, canvas tents, pavilions, baskets, crates, wagons, barrels, wheelbarrows, carts, and bones creating a tattered display of the chaos of that day left behind. The distant sounds of a lullaby, chimes, and faraway bells fills the air.": "这个广场由两个广场组成，中间有一群银行、金库、行会大厅和商业建筑隔开。广场周围是高级别墅和商店的废墟和遗迹。广场上散落着德拉肯海姆中心露天市场的遗迹：排成一排的摊位、帐篷、亭子、篮子、板条箱、货车、桶、手推车和骨头，展示出那天留下的混乱景象。远处传来摇篮曲、风铃声和遥远钟声填满了空气。",
	"Market Square Plaza bears the scars of many battles: makeshift barricades, scorch marks, broken weapons, armour scraps, and a few scattered corpses.

	"This building is not far from the clocktower. Formerly the administrative hub for trade and industry in Drakkenheim, this larger open hall is a gathering place for the city guild leaders and merchants, and contains offices, vaults, and a large auditorium that served as council chambers for the guild. However, the once-great vaulted roof has entirely collapsed, leaving mostly only the outer shell of the great building behind. Perhaps several impressive vaults lay buried under heaps of wreckage and rubble, but it would take significant effort to excavate the damage.": "这座建筑离钟楼不远。这座大型开放大厅曾是德拉肯海姆贸易和工业的行政中心，是城市行会领袖和商人的聚集地，内设办公室、金库和一个大型礼堂，曾是行会议会的地方。然而，曾经宏伟的拱顶已完全坍塌，如今只剩下这座大楼的外壳。也许有几个令人印象深刻的金库被埋在废墟和瓦砾之下，但要清理这些损坏需要付出巨大的努力。",
	"At the centre of the square is the clocktower. The three-hundred-foot tall square tower is about fifty feet wide at the base, with rounded turret corners and walls supported by great buttresses. The front facade is a mechanical wonder. Near the top of the tower is a massive thirty-foot-wide clock face made from glass, the numerals and hands filigreed with silver, brass, and gold. Above are several crenellated balconies, and the roof is a steep spire topped with a wrought-iron weathervane.": "在广场的中心是钟楼。这座高三百英尺的方形塔楼在底部约五十英尺宽，四个圆角塔楼和墙壁由巨大的支撑拱支撑。正面立面是一个机械奇迹。在塔楼的顶部附近是一个由玻璃制成的巨大三十英尺宽的钟面，钟面上的数字和指针镀银、黄铜和金。上面有几个垛口阳台，屋顶是一个陡峭的尖顶，顶部有一个铁艺风向标。",
	"Bordering the central clock is an embossed metal and glass dial that depicts the transit of the sun and the phases of the moon through each month. From this dial, one can read not only the time but the date, as it shows a stylized interpretation of the seasons and constellations. Extending down the clock face is a further system of circular glass plates, gears, and wheels that illustrate in mechanical precision the grand cosmic dance of the planets and stars as they hurtle through the astral void. Multicoloured glass lenses superimposed over the planet depict the metaphysical orbit of the afterworlds and side-realms and their relation to the mortal world. The rest of the tower is decorated with elegant carved statues depicting angels, saints, demons, devils, elementals, and the various creatures of the worlds beyond. On some levels are rows of gothic windows with trefoil arches filled with stained-glass mosaics.": "在中央时钟的边缘，有一个凸起的金属和玻璃表盘，描绘了太阳的运行和月相在每个月中的变化。通过这个表盘，人们不仅可以读取时间，还可以读取日期，因为它展示了季节和星座的风格化解释。沿着时钟表盘延伸下去是另一个由圆形玻璃板、齿轮和轮子组成的系统，以机械精度展示了行星和恒星在星空虚空中穿越时的宏伟宇宙之舞。覆盖在行星上的多彩玻璃透镜描绘了冥界和边界领域的形而上学轨道，以及它们与凡间世界的关系。塔的其余部分装饰着优雅的雕像，描绘了天使、圣徒、恶魔、魔鬼、元素精灵和其他世界生物。在一些层次上，有排列着哥特式窗户和三叶草拱门，填满了彩色玻璃马赛克。",

	"The tower interior is a dramatic contrast to the elegant outer facade. The walls are exposed brick, and a rickety wooden staircase ascends the interior supported by a wrought-iron scaffold. The decorative exterior windows allow some light to pass into the tower; many along the way are shattered and broken. The stone floor is covered in dust, bone, debris, and avian feces. Gears connected by chains, stacks of heavy dangling counterweights on pulleys, and pendulum mechanisms hang down the northern wall. High above can be seen the bells.": "塔楼内部与优雅的外立面形成鲜明对比。墙壁是裸露的砖墙，一座摇摇欲坠的木质楼梯沿着内部上升，由锻铁脚手架支撑。装饰性外窗允许一些光线透入塔楼；沿途许多窗户都是破碎的。石地板上覆盖着灰尘、骨头、碎片和鸟类粪便。连接着链条的齿轮、吊在滑轮上的沉重悬挂式配重和摆钟机构挂在北墙上。高处可以看到钟铃。",

Hardy vines cling to the statues like leeches, and strange flowers in unnatural hues bloom in the gardens. A potent pollen hangs in the air - a smell between musk and sweet perfume.

On either side of the path is a beautiful decorated floral garden. The gardens are lined with fluorescent purple flowers accented with hints of orange, yellow, or green. They are not eldritch lilies, but to the untrained eye they may appear to be. A DC 20 {@skill Nature} check reveals them to be false lilies.
