	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} tells an epic story spanning two adventures, {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ} and {@i The Rise of Tiamat}—the two tales contained within this collection. Both adventures are introduced here, outlining their backgrounds, plots, and fundamental ties, followed by details on allies and villains relevant to both adventures. Regardless of which adventure you're running, this overview provides useful information, applicable to the wider campaign and helpful for foreshadowing the threats unleashed by the Cult of the Dragon.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}讲述了一个跨越两个冒险的史诗故事，即{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}和{@i The Rise of Tiamat}--这套书中的两个故事。这里介绍了两个冒险，概述了它们的背景、情节和基本联系，然后是与两个冒险有关的盟友和反派的细节。无论你在进行哪一个冒险，这个概述都提供了有用的信息，适用于更广泛的战役，并有助于预示龙之教所释放的威胁。",
	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} is set in the Forgotten Realms on Faerûn's western shore—the Sword Coast. A thin strip of civilization stretches down this coast, where widely spaced cities are arranged like beads on a string. Roads loosely connect the cities that stretch from Luskan in the north to Calimport in the south, passing through Neverwinter, Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, and other ports along the way. The bulk of this adventure takes place on the stretch between Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的背景是被遗忘的领域，在Faerûn的西海岸--剑海岸。一条细长的文明带沿着这个海岸线延伸，那里的城市像串珠子一样排列着。道路松散地连接着从北部的卢斯坎到南部的卡林波特的城市，沿途经过永夜城、水底城、博德之门和其他港口。这场冒险的大部分内容发生在博德之门和永夜之间的路段。",
	"You can play this adventure with just the Dungeons & Dragons basic rules and the {@i Tyranny of Dragons} appendix online, which contains all the monsters and magic items not described in this book. Both of these supplements are available as free downloads on {@link DungeonsandDragons.com|https://dnd.wizards.com}.": "你可以只用《龙与地下城》的基本规则和网上的{@i Tyranny of Dragons}附录来玩这个冒险，其中包含了本书中没有描述的所有怪物和魔法物品。这两个附录都可以在{@link DungeonsandDragons.com|https://dnd.wizards.com}上免费下载。",
	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} tells an epic story across two adventures, of which {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ} is the first. Characters begin this adventure at 1st level; by the end of it they should be 7th or 8th level and ready to continue with {@i The Rise of Tiamat}. The ideal party size is four characters. If your group is larger or smaller, you can adjust the adventure's difficulty by adjusting the number of enemies in each encounter.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}通过两个冒险讲述了一个史诗般的故事，其中{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}是第一个。角色从1级开始冒险；在冒险结束时，他们应该是7级或8级，并准备好继续进行{@i The Rise of Tiamat}。理想的队伍规模是四个角色。如果你的队伍人数较多或较少，你可以通过调整每个遭遇中的敌人数量来调整冒险的难度。",
	"At your option, you can use the milestone experience rule. Under this rule, you pick events in the campaign that cause the characters to level up. In {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}, the characters gain a level after completing each chapter except chapter 5.": "根据你的选择，你可以使用里程碑式的经验规则。在这个规则下，你在战役中挑选事件，使角色的等级提高。在{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}中，人物在完成每一章后都会获得一个等级，第五章除外。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon has been active in Faerûn for centuries. It has focused on making undead dragons to fulfill a prophecy most of that time, but that's changing.": "龙的崇拜在法鲁恩已经活跃了几个世纪。在那段时间里，它一直专注于制造不死龙来实现一个预言，但这正在改变。",
	"{@creature Severin|RoT}'s ambition amused {@creature Tiamat|RoT}, so she revealed the existence of five dragon masks to him—one for each chromatic dragon color. Individually, these ancient masks allow wearers to communicate with dragons. More importantly, a person who is erudite in draconic lore becomes a wyrmspeaker while wearing the mask, which allows the wearer to think like a dragon, gain favor among dragons, and subtly influence their behavior. When all five are brought together, they magically merge into a single Mask of the Dragon Queen. With the assembled mask, the cult can release {@creature Tiamat|RoT} from her prison in the Nine Hells.": "{@creature Severin|RoT}的雄心壮志让{@creature Tiamat|RoT}感到高兴，所以她向他透露了五个龙面具的存在--一个代表每种色泽的龙。单独来看，这些古老的面具允许佩戴者与龙交流。更重要的是，一个精通龙族传说的人在戴上面具后会成为一个巫师，这让佩戴者能够像龙一样思考，在龙族中获得青睐，并巧妙地影响他们的行为。当所有五个人被聚集在一起时，他们会神奇地合并成一个龙后的面具。有了组装好的面具，邪教可以把{@creature Tiamat|RoT}从她在九层地狱的监狱中释放出来。",
	"After {@creature Severin|RoT} (subtly guided by {@creature Tiamat|RoT}) discovered that secret, he bent all the cult's resources to finding the long-lost dragon masks in their secret hiding places. When he recovered the red mask, {@creature Severin|RoT} became the first of the wyrmspeakers, but others soon followed.": "在{@creature Severin|RoT}（在{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的巧妙引导下）发现了这个秘密后，他将邪教的所有资源用于寻找失传已久的龙面具的秘密藏身处。当他找到红色面具时，{@creature Severin|RoT}成为第一个讲巫术的人，但其他人很快就跟上了。",
	"Besides his cultists, {@creature Severin|RoT} has forged an alliance with a splinter faction of the Red Wizards of Thay. This small and secretive group, led by an outcast named Rath Modar, plots to unseat the lich Szass Tam from his position over the Red Wizards. Rath believes that in exchange for his help in releasing {@creature Tiamat|RoT}, she will grant him the power he needs to overthrow Szass Tam.": "除了他的崇拜者，{@creature Severin|RoT}还与泰伊红袍巫师的一个分裂派别结成联盟。这个小而隐秘的团体由一个名叫拉斯-莫达尔（Rath Modar）的弃儿领导，计划将巫师萨斯-塔姆（Szass Tam）从他在红袍巫师的位置上赶下来。拉斯认为，作为释放{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的交换条件，她会给予他所需的力量来推翻萨斯-谭。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon is organized in cells, which vary in size from just a handful of members to scores. Leaders in the cult are known as Wearers of Purple, and they outrank normal cultists, but no formal grades exist within the ranks of the Wearers of Purple.": "神龙教是以小组为单位组织的，小组的规模从几名成员到几十名成员不等。邪教中的领袖被称为 \"穿紫 \"者，他们的地位高于普通的邪教成员，但在 \"穿紫 \"者的队伍中没有正式的等级。",
	"Although the cult uses regalia in its rituals and its distant camps, members who operate in public places dress and act no differently from anyone else.": "尽管该邪教在其仪式和远处的营地中使用礼服，但在公共场所活动的成员的穿着和行为与其他人没有区别。",
	"The cult is not above hiring mercenaries when it has special jobs to fulfill. Indeed, many of the \"cultists\" that characters encounter in the first three chapters of this adventure are working for pay.": "当邪教有特殊的工作需要完成时，它也会雇佣雇佣兵。事实上，在这次冒险的前三章中，角色们遇到的许多 \"邪教徒 \"都是为了报酬而工作。",
	"During the time covered by the first half of this adventure, the cult already has several of the five dragon masks. While the cult works to gain more, {@creature Severin|RoT} initiates the second part of his plan to release {@creature Tiamat|RoT}: recruiting dragons and assembling a treasure hoard worthy of the queen of evil dragons. These efforts draw the characters' attention to the cult.": "在本冒险的前半部分所涵盖的时间里，邪教已经拥有了五个龙面具中的几个。在邪教组织努力获得更多的时候，{@creature Severin|RoT}启动了他释放{@creature Tiamat|RoT}计划的第二部分：招募龙并组建一个配得上恶龙女王的宝库。这些努力吸引了人物对邪教的注意。",
	"The action begins when a town comes under attack by a dragon and its allies. Characters can intervene to save townsfolk, but not before attackers carry away an important scholar. While rescuing that captive from the raiders' camp, characters learn they are up against the Cult of the Dragon, and they have the chance to destroy a subterranean dragon hatchery that the cult guards.": "行动开始时，一个小镇受到一条龙及其盟友的攻击。角色们可以出面拯救镇民，但在袭击者带走一位重要学者之前。在从袭击者的营地中救出这个俘虏时，角色们得知他们的对手是龙的崇拜，他们有机会摧毁该崇拜所守护的地下龙孵化场。",
	"The hatchery provides clues to the cult's operation and sends the characters on a long journey northward.During that trip, they face threats from the cult and gain some unexpected allies within the Zhentarim, a shadowy organization with an unsavory history. North of Waterdeep, the cult's contraband is offloaded at a smuggler's den for shipment to a castle long ago abandoned.": "孵化场为邪教的运作提供了线索，并将人物送上了向北的漫长旅程。在这次旅程中，他们面临着来自邪教的威胁，并在Zhentarim（一个有着不光彩历史的阴暗组织）中获得了一些意外的盟友。在沃特迪普北部，邪教的违禁品在一个走私者的窝点被卸下，运往一个早已被遗弃的城堡。",
	"A portal beneath the castle connects to the stronghold of one of the cult's most powerful and most disgruntled members, Talis the White, who can become either a deadly enemy or a crucial collaborator to the characters. With or without Talis's help, the characters must get into a flying citadel that a cloud giant placed at the cult's disposal and prevent it from reaching its destination at the Well of Dragons.": "城堡下面的一个传送门连接到邪教最强大和最不满的成员之一--白衣塔利斯的据点，他既可以成为致命的敌人，也可以成为角色们的重要合作者。不管有没有塔利斯的帮助，角色们都必须进入一个云端巨人放置在邪教手中的飞行城堡，并阻止它到达龙之井的目的地。",
	"{@i The Rise of Tiamat} continues the tale of {@i Tyranny of Dragons}. Characters begin this adventure at 8th level, likely having attained that level through the events of the first volume, {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}. By this adventure's conclusion, the characters should reach approximately 15th level. Four characters is the ideal party size. If your group is smaller than that, consider removing a few opponents from combat encounters. If the group is bigger, add opponents to the fights. Consider altering encounters for smaller groups to avoid overly tough battles.": "{@i The Rise of Tiamat}继续讲述了{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的故事。角色开始这次冒险时是8级，很可能是通过第一卷的事件达到了这个等级，{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}。在这次冒险结束时，人物应该达到大约15级。四个角色是理想的聚会规模。如果你的队伍比这个人数少，可以考虑从战斗遭遇中删除一些对手。如果队伍比较大，就在战斗中增加对手。考虑为小团体改变遭遇战，以避免过于艰难的战斗。",
	"The time of dragons dawns. Calling upon ancient magic and a host of draconic allies, the Cult of the Dragon seeks to unleash {@creature Tiamat|RoT} from her prison in the Nine Hells. By bringing the Queen of Dragons bodily into the world, the cult plans to scour away their foes and usher in a new age of draconic dominance. So far, they've gathered great stores of treasure, forged an alliance with Thay to assist with performing the required summoning ritual, gathered the five dragon masks central to the ritual (see \"{@area Dragon Masks|009|x},\" below), and persuaded or cajoled many of the oldest and strongest evil dragons of Faerûn into supporting them.": "龙的时代来临了。召唤古老的魔法和大量的龙族盟友，龙的崇拜试图将{@creature Tiamat|RoT}从她在九层地狱的监狱中释放出来。通过将龙后带入世界，该教派计划扫除他们的敌人，并迎来一个龙族统治的新时代。到目前为止，他们已经收集了大量的财宝，与泰伊结成联盟，协助进行所需的召唤仪式，收集了仪式中最重要的五个龙面具（见下文\"{@area Dragon Masks|009|x}\"），并说服或劝说了许多法鲁恩最古老和最强大的恶龙支持他们。",
	"However, not everything has gone according to the cult's plans. The discovery of an alliance between the Cult of the Dragon and the Red Wizards of Thay has shaken the various factions aligned against both organizations. The Harpers view any such alliance as an abomination, as does the Order of the Gauntlet. The Lords' Alliance recognizes the obvious threat to the lands and rulers of the Sword Coast and the North, while the Emerald Enclave suspects that anything Thay promotes is likely against the natural order. Even the Zhentarim fear the union of two such powerful forces.": "然而，并非一切都按照邪教的计划进行。发现神龙教和泰伊的红袍巫师之间的联盟，动摇了与这两个组织结盟的各个派别。哈珀人认为任何这样的联盟都是可憎的，高塔骑士团也是如此。领主联盟认识到对剑海岸和北方的土地和统治者的明显威胁，而翡翠飞地则怀疑泰伊所提倡的任何东西都可能违反自然秩序。甚至赞塔林也害怕两个如此强大的势力的联合。",
	"News of the alliance has thus brought the various factions of the Sword Coast together. The leaders of those factions understand that they must gather and rally forces to fight the cult, even as the situation in Faerûn grows more dire. Abductions and raids undertaken by the Cult of the Dragon increase daily, and refugees are fleeing from burned-out regions under cult attack to major cities and fortresses. Villagers have abandoned their homes, fleeing the constant predation of dragons. In many cities, all-out panic has created a growing movement in favor of agreeing to the cult's demands in the hope of winning concessions in return. It is difficult to muster troops when people are afraid they will be burned by dragonfire. This is a time for heroes to inspire the people of the Sword Coast with a great victory or two. Fortunately, the Forgotten Realms has just such a group of heroes.": "因此，联盟的消息让剑海岸的各个派别走到了一起。这些派别的领导人明白，他们必须聚集和集结力量来对抗邪教，即使法鲁恩的局势变得更加严峻。神龙教的绑架和袭击每天都在增加，难民们正从被邪教攻击的烧毁地区逃往主要城市和堡垒。村民们放弃了他们的家园，以逃避龙的不断掠夺。在许多城市，全面的恐慌产生了一个日益增长的运动，赞成同意邪教的要求，希望能赢得让步的回报。当人们害怕他们会被龙火烧死时，很难召集军队。这是一个英雄们用一两个伟大的胜利来鼓舞剑海岸人民的时刻。幸运的是，被遗忘的国度就有这样一群英雄。",
	"In the first volume of {@i Tyranny of Dragons}, the Cult of the Dragon gathered up a hoard for {@creature Tiamat|RoT}—then lost a portion of that hoard when Skyreach Castle fell. All the while, the cult kept secret its goal of bringing back {@creature Tiamat|RoT} and its alliance with an exiled group of Red Wizards of Thay. The cult now needs only to gather enough sacrifices to power the ritual by which the dragon masks will open a portal to the Nine Hells, allowing {@creature Tiamat|RoT} to travel to the Material Plane.": "在{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的第一卷中，神龙教为{@creature Tiamat|RoT}收集了一个囤积物--然后在天际城堡陷落时失去了一部分囤积物。一直以来，该教派对其带回{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的目标以及与流亡的泰伊红袍巫师团体的联盟保密。邪教现在只需要收集足够的祭品，为龙面具打开通往九层地狱的入口的仪式提供能量，让{@creature Tiamat|RoT}能够前往物质世界。",
	"These plans continue to move ahead as the Thayan exile Rath Modar and his Red Wizards bring expertise in summoning magic to the cult, preparing a tremendous blood sacrifice to empower the ritual. The alliance between wizards and cultists is fragile, however, since neither side entirely trusts the promises of the other.": "这些计划继续向前推进，因为泰雅族的流亡者拉斯-莫达尔和他的红袍巫师为邪教带来了召唤魔法的专业知识，准备了一个巨大的血祭来增强仪式的力量。然而，巫师和邪教徒之间的联盟是脆弱的，因为双方都不完全相信对方的承诺。",
	"At the start this adventure, representatives of groups and factions from across the Sword Coast meet to discuss their concern about the Cult of the Dragon, and to draw up plans for opposing the cult. The adventurers are summoned to Waterdeep for a summit that will come to be known as the Council of Waterdeep (see {@area chapter 9|05f|x} for details).": "在这次冒险的开始，整个剑海岸的团体和派别的代表开会讨论他们对神龙教的关注，并制定了反对该教派的计划。冒险家们被召集到沃特迪普参加一个峰会，这个峰会将被称为沃特迪普议会（详见{@area chapter 9|05f|x}）。",
	"Four council sessions take place over the course of the adventure, naturally dividing events into four stages. Between the council gatherings, the characters undertake missions to thwart the cult's plans. Some of these missions will be proposed by NPCs (nonplayer characters) during council sessions. Others can be proposed by the characters. The adventurers understand that thousands of lives depend on their actions. The characters are among the greatest heroes of the Sword Coast, and the Council of Waterdeep looks to them for wise guidance and swift action.": "在冒险过程中会有四次议会会议，自然地将事件分为四个阶段。在理事会会议之间，角色们要执行任务来挫败邪教的计划。其中一些任务将由理事会会议期间的NPC（非玩家角色）提出。其他任务可以由角色提出。冒险家们明白，成千上万的生命都取决于他们的行动。这些角色是剑海岸最伟大的英雄之一，沃特德普议会期待他们提供明智的指导和迅速的行动。",
	"Many of the power groups represented on the council don't trust each other, and some even have conflicting goals. Over the course of the council's four meetings, the players and characters need to forge this disparate, feuding group into a coordinated force. Only with all factions working together and contributing to the overall effort can enough power be brought to bear against the cult to prevent {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s return. The more successful the characters are in their actions against the cult, the more esteem and influence they gain with the council.": "理事会中的许多权力集团彼此不信任，有些甚至有冲突的目标。在委员会四次会议的过程中，玩家和角色需要将这个不相干的、有争执的团体打造成一个协调的力量。只有所有的派别一起工作并为整体努力做出贡献，才能有足够的力量来对抗邪教，阻止{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的回归。人物对邪教的行动越成功，他们在议会中获得的尊重和影响就越大。",
	"The events of {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ} lead directly into {@i {@i The Rise of Tiamat}.} The shape of this adventure is defined by the meetings of the Council of Waterdeep, which divide the adventure into four stages.": "{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}的事件直接导致了{@i {@i The Rise of Tiamat}。这场冒险的形式是由沃特德普议会的会议决定的，它将冒险分为四个阶段。",
	"{@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT}, a tiefling sorcerer of the Arcane Brotherhood, is an acknowledged expert on the {@item Draakhorn|RoT}—an ancient relic being used by the cult to summon dragons to their cause. She disappeared three years ago in the Sea of Moving Ice, where she is presently a prisoner of the white dragon Arauthator. The characters must make their way to Arauthator's iceberg lair and convince Maccath to join them. By driving away the dragon and carrying off valuable dragon lore, they deal a blow to the cult and might gain the Arcane Brotherhood as allies in the process.": "{@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT}，一个奥术兄弟会的铁皮人巫师，是公认的{@item Draakhorn|RoT}专家--一个被邪教用来召唤龙的古老遗物，是他们的事业。她三年前在移动的冰海中失踪了，目前她被白龙Arauthator囚禁在那里。角色们必须前往Arauthator的冰山巢穴，说服Maccath加入他们。通过赶走龙并带走有价值的龙的传说，他们对邪教进行了打击，并可能在这个过程中获得奥术兄弟会的盟友。",
	"The cult's leaders aren't oblivious to the damage being caused by the heroes. Assassins try to stop the characters' interference, but the cultists misjudge the strength needed to complete the job.": "邪教的领导人并没有对英雄们造成的伤害视而不见。刺客们试图阻止人物的干扰，但邪教分子错误地判断了完成工作所需的力量。",
	"The characters regroup with the leaders of the Sword Coast's factions at the Council of Waterdeep, assessing their victories over the cult and planning the factions' next moves.": "角色们在沃特德普议会与剑海岸各派系的领袖重新聚集，评估他们对邪教的胜利，并计划各派系的下一步行动。",
	"The metallic dragons of the Sword Coast send word to the Council of Waterdeep that they wish to participate in the coming struggle. The adventurers are chosen to attend a council of dragons in the Sunset Mountains, pleading the humanoid factions' case to some of the oldest and most powerful creatures in Faerûn.": "剑海岸的金属龙向沃特德普的议会传话，说他们希望参与即将到来的斗争。冒险家们被选中参加落日山脉的龙族议会，向法鲁恩最古老、最强大的生物恳求人形派别的情况。",
	"After a first attempt to assassinate the heroes failed, the Cult of the Dragon tries again. With a better idea of what they're up against, they have a better chance to succeed.": "在第一次试图暗杀英雄的行动失败后，神龙教再次尝试。由于对他们的对手有了更多的了解，他们有更好的机会成功。",
	"At the third meeting of the Council of Waterdeep, the characters take lead roles in shaping the fight against the cult.": "在沃特德普议会的第三次会议上，这些人物在塑造打击邪教的斗争中发挥了主导作用。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon is not without its own internal strife, as the adventurers discover when a cultist contacts them with the offer to turn over one of the dragon masks essential to {@creature Severin|RoT}'s plans. The characters must infiltrate a cult stronghold and claim the mask, then save a nearby village from the blue dragon that means to take the relic back.": "当一个邪教分子与他们联系，提出交出对{@creature Severin|RoT}的计划至关重要的一个龙面具时，冒险者们发现，龙之教并非没有内部纷争。冒险家们必须潜入邪教的据点，夺取面具，然后从企图夺回遗物的蓝龙手中拯救附近的村庄。",
	"The ritual that will bring {@creature Tiamat|RoT} to Faerûn is too complex for the cult's spellcasters to perform without their {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} allies—all Thayan exiles. The adventurers travel to Thay to forge an alliance with the Red Wizards, whose lich lord Szass Tam hungers for revenge against the exiles. The Red Wizards of Thay are evil to the core, though, and the delegates must tread carefully as they present their case.": "这个仪式将把{@creature Tiamat|RoT}带到法鲁恩，对于邪教的施法者来说，如果没有他们的{@creature Red Wizard|RoT}盟友--所有泰雅族的流亡者，就无法完成这个仪式。冒险家们前往泰伊，与红袍巫师结成联盟，他们的巫师领主萨斯-塔姆渴望向流亡者复仇。不过，泰伊的红袍巫师们邪恶至极，代表们在陈述他们的理由时必须小心谨慎。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon now knows the adventurers' strengths and methods. If the characters don't take precautions to safeguard themselves, the cult stands a good chance of killing them all with a third attack.": "神龙教现在知道了冒险者们的实力和方法。如果人物不采取预防措施保护自己，邪教很有可能通过第三次攻击将他们全部杀死。",
	"At the final meeting of the council, the characters must work to unite the factions of the Sword Coast for the final battle against the Cult of the Dragon. {@creature Severin|RoT} is ready to fulfill his plans, and the combined forces of the Sword Coast must strike now if the cult is to be stopped.": "在议会的最后一次会议上，角色们必须努力团结剑海岸的各个派别，与神龙教进行最后的战斗。{@creature Severin|RoT}已经准备好实现他的计划，如果要阻止这个邪教，剑海岸的联合力量必须现在就出击。",
	"At the Well of Dragons, a battle unfolds that will decide the fate of Faerûn. The factions of the Sword Coast fight alongside new and unexpected allies, facing off against the assembled might of the dragon cultists, flights of chromatic dragons, other monsters, and mercenaries. The adventurers choose their own role during the battle, and might rescue sacrificial prisoners, shut down the {@item Draakhorn|RoT}, or take the lead in disrupting the magical ritual that will allow {@creature Tiamat|RoT} to enter the world.": "在龙之井，一场决定Faerûn命运的战斗展开了。剑海岸的各派别与新的和出乎意料的盟友一起战斗，面对龙崇拜者的集结力量、彩龙的飞行、其他怪物和雇佣兵。冒险家们在战斗中选择自己的角色，可能拯救牺牲的囚犯，关闭{@item Draakhorn|RoT}，或者带头破坏让{@creature Tiamat|RoT}进入世界的魔法仪式。",
	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons: {@i The Rise of Tiamat}} was designed around the milestone system of advancement. At the start of the adventure, the characters should be 7th or 8th level. Instead of tracking specific experience awards, characters can level up at the completion of significant chapters of the adventure. The characters level up after every chapter listed below:": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons: {@i The Rise of Tiamat}}是围绕里程碑式的晋级系统设计的。在冒险开始时，角色应该是7级或8级。角色可以在完成冒险的重要章节时提升等级，而不是跟踪具体的经验奖励。角色在下面列出的每一章之后都会提升等级。",

	"{@i The Rise of Tiamat} is an open-framework adventure designed for higher-level characters. As such, not all your game sessions need to stick to the main track of the adventure narrative. Additional events, rumors, and encounters can be used as needed or added as side treks or distractions. The following encounter seeds are meant to be used when you want to break up the narrative or if the players get off track. Each can be expanded as you like, and is meant to tie into one of the main chapters in the adventure (or to let you gently guide the players in that direction). Each additional encounter also provides a sense of the wider scope of the setting.": "{@i The Rise of Tiamat}是一个为高等级角色设计的开放框架的冒险。因此，并不是所有的游戏环节都需要坚持冒险叙事的主轨道。额外的事件、传言和遭遇可以根据需要使用，也可以作为侧面的跋涉或分散注意力而添加。下面这些遭遇的种子，是为了在你想打破叙事的时候，或者在玩家偏离轨道的时候使用。每一个都可以根据你的需要进行扩展，目的是与冒险中的一个主要章节联系起来（或者让你温和地引导玩家往那个方向走）。每一个额外的遭遇也能让人感受到更广泛的背景。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon expands its operation in larger and bolder ways. Its leaders send diplomatic missions to Berdusk, Triel, and other settlements demanding tribute—and offering protection from dragon raids for those who comply. Cultists shake down caravans seeking protection money, and have been burning caravans that belong to the rivals of those who do pay. Less scrupulous merchants are finding it easier to do business with the cult than to fight against them. Any Zhentarim contacts of the adventurers are understandably worried about these developments.": "神龙教以更大、更大胆的方式扩展其行动。其领导人向伯达斯克（Berdusk）、特里尔（Triel）和其他定居点派出外交使团，要求进贡--并为那些遵守规定的人提供保护，使其免受龙的袭击。崇拜者摇晃着寻求保护费的商队，并一直在焚烧属于那些付钱的人的对手的商队。没有那么多顾虑的商人发现与邪教做生意比与他们作对更容易。冒险者的任何Zhentarim联系人都对这些发展感到担忧，这是可以理解的。",
	"Though the Cult of the Dragon and the Red Wizards are making use of diabolic allies as they plan the ritual that will free {@creature Tiamat|RoT}, not all devils are on their side. Some fiends not wanting to see {@creature Tiamat|RoT} gain worldly power seek to break the alliance between the cult and Thay. This encounter can be used to reveal to the characters the divisions already present among the evil factions.": "尽管神龙教和红袍巫师在计划释放{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的仪式时利用了邪恶的盟友，但并非所有的魔鬼都站在他们一边。一些不希望看到{@creature Tiamat|RoT}获得世俗权力的魔鬼试图破坏邪教和泰伊之间的联盟。这个遭遇可以用来向人物揭示邪恶派别之间已经存在的分歧。",
	"The devils who are aligned against {@creature Tiamat|RoT} send a delegation of 5 {@creature Cultist||cultists} and 2 {@creature Cult Fanatic||cult fanatics} (devil worshipers) and a {@creature bone devil} named Lord Volmer to treat with the party.

The bone devil assures the characters that they can earn the Red Wizards' favor by providing him with information leading to Rath Modar's capture.": "沃尔默勋爵用心灵感应告诉冒险者们所谓的 \"泰雅人的复活\"（泰雅人流亡者试图取代萨斯-塔姆），以及萨斯-塔姆打算摧毁拉斯-莫达尔和他的 \"分裂教派 \"的事实，因为他们无礼。骨魔向这些人物保证，他们可以通过向红袍巫师提供捕获拉斯-莫达尔的信息来获得红袍巫师的青睐。",
	"Lord Volmer also tells the party that the lords of the Nine Hells are divided when it comes to the matter of {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s release. He tells the party that if {@creature Tiamat|RoT} is prevented from escaping, the party will earn \"powerful friends\" in the Nine Hells.

The devil is not worried about dying, since he reforms at full strength in the Nine Hells upon his demise.": "沃尔默勋爵还告诉大家，在释放{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的问题上，九层地狱的领主们存在分歧。他告诉一行人，如果阻止{@creature Tiamat|RoT}逃跑，一行人将在九层地狱赢得 \"强大的朋友\"。如果人物攻击沃尔默勋爵，他和他的盟友会进行报复。魔鬼并不担心死亡，因为他死后会在九层地狱中全力改造。",
	"A group of dwarf miners has captured a high-ranking member of the Cult of the Dragon—a Wearer of Purple named Cheela Flegsteel who got a little too greedy while leading a group of cultists that was terrorizing the dwarves.

	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} is a big, sprawling adventure that covers many levels of play and a huge swath of the Forgotten Realms. This book outlines the overall structure of the adventure and presents many chapters and events with which to challenge the characters as they investigate the nefarious plots of the Cult of the Dragon. This is not, however, a script to be read aloud with stage directions that must be followed. {@i Tyranny of Dragons} does not hold your hand and guide you step-by-step from the story's beginning to its inevitable conclusion. Instead, it presents people, creatures, locations, and situations for the adventurers to explore and interact with in a constantly changing, lively way.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}是一个大型的、庞大的冒险，涵盖了许多层次的游戏和被遗忘的领域的大片区域。本书概述了冒险的整体结构，并提出了许多章节和事件，在人物调查龙之教的邪恶阴谋时对他们进行挑战。然而，这并不是一个可以大声朗读的剧本和必须遵守的舞台指示。{@i Tyranny of Dragons}不会牵着你的手，一步一步地引导你从故事的开始到其不可避免的结论。相反，它为冒险者提供了人物、生物、地点和情况，让他们以不断变化、生动的方式进行探索和互动。",

However, D&D players are curious and unpredictable, and Faerûn is immense and filled with possibility. In a scenario as open-ended as this one, it is all but guaranteed that at some point during the adventure—and possibly at many points—the players will develop their own ideas about how to handle a situation or how to deal with the cult. And just like that, they'll be off and running in directions that aren't covered by this book. Those kinds of situations put a DM's skill to the test—but they also produce some of the greatest gaming moments and memories.": "你，地下城管理员，扮演着一个重要的角色。{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的创作者已经试图预见人物在冒险中最可能采取的行动路线。然而，D&D玩家是好奇的、不可预测的，而Faerûn是巨大的，充满了可能性。在一个像这样的开放式场景中，几乎可以保证在冒险过程中的某个时刻--可能是很多时刻--玩家会对如何处理某种情况或如何处理邪教组织产生自己的想法。就这样，他们就会向本书没有涉及的方向跑去。这类情况对管理员的技能是个考验，但它们也会产生一些最美好的游戏时刻和回忆。",

	"The Cult of the Dragon has existed for centuries. During most of that time, its members have focused on the creation and worship of dracoliches, based on a prophecy translated by the cult's founder, Sammaster. However, those goals changed with the rise of a young cultist named {@creature Severin|RoT}.": "龙的崇拜已经存在了几个世纪。在大部分时间里，其成员根据邪教创始人Sammaster翻译的预言，专注于创造和崇拜龙的工作。然而，这些目标随着一个名叫{@creature Severin|RoT}的年轻邪教徒的崛起而改变。",

Dragons shall rule the world entire...\" {@creature Severin|RoT}'s quest to reshape the cult led him to the dragon Hoondarrh, \"the Red Rage of Mintarn.\" The fact that {@creature Severin|RoT} not only survived this encounter but befriended the dragon impressed {@creature Tiamat|RoT} in her exile in the Nine Hells. As a reward and further test, she allowed {@creature Severin|RoT} a scrap of knowledge regarding the existence of the five dragon masks. {@creature Severin|RoT} took that bit of information and did what few others could have accomplished, searching for and finding all five masks. The task took years to complete, and it led directly to the crisis that Faerûn now faces.": "在{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的启发下，{@creature Severin|RoT}重新审视了由Sammaster翻译的文本，发现了不同的解释，认为 \"除了破碎的王座，什么都不会留下，除了死者，没有统治者。龙将统治整个世界......\" {@creature Severin|RoT}对重塑邪教的追求使他找到了龙Hoondarrh，\"Mintarn的红色怒火\"。{@creature Severin|RoT}不仅在这次遭遇中幸存下来，还与龙结为好友，这给流亡在九层地狱的{@creature Tiamat|RoT}留下了深刻印象。作为奖励和进一步的测试，她允许{@creature Severin|RoT}获得关于五龙面具存在的一丝知识。{@creature Severin|RoT}带着这一点信息，做了很少有人能完成的事情，寻找并找到了所有五个面具。这项任务耗时多年才完成，它直接导致了法鲁恩现在面临的危机。",
	"{@creature Severin|RoT} kept the red mask for himself. As other masks were found, he presented them to his closest allies in the Cult of the Dragon, granting each the power of a wyrmspeaker. Using the magic of the dragon masks, this Inner Circle of Wyrmspeakers helps {@creature Severin|RoT} prepare the way for {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s return.": "{@creature Severin|RoT}为自己保留了红色面具。随着其他面具的发现，他把它们送给了他在神龙教中最亲密的盟友，赋予了每个人巫师的力量。利用龙面具的魔力，这个巫师内圈帮助{@creature Severin|RoT}为{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的回归做准备。",
	"The plots of the Cult of the Dragon are secret, but its existence is not. Most folk of the Sword Coast have heard of the cult, but know only that its members revere evil dragons. The cult recruits new members in major cities, and word quickly gets around. Moreover, many cultists engage in legitimate business or are assigned to ordinary academic research. Only a relative few serve as thieves, assassins, and spies.": "神龙教的阴谋是秘密的，但它的存在却不是。剑海岸的大多数人都听说过这个邪教，但只知道其成员崇尚邪恶的龙。该邪教在主要城市招募新成员，消息很快就传开了。此外，许多邪教成员从事合法的商业活动，或被指派从事普通的学术研究。只有相对少数人充当小偷、刺客和间谍。",
	"Dragon-themed symbolism and iconography pervade the cult's official regalia—black clothing that features a cape or cloak cut to resemble dragon wings, and festooned with jewelry and draconic imagery reflecting the wearer's favorite type of dragon. Masks are common at cult gatherings.": "以龙为主题的象征意义和图腾充斥着邪教的官方服饰--黑色的服装，其特点是披风或斗篷剪裁得像龙的翅膀，并缀有反映佩戴者最喜欢的龙类型的珠宝和龙的图像。面具在邪教集会上很常见。",
	"Cult operation groups are assembled to match their assigned tasks. They vary in size, from a few low-ranking cultists operating on their own to hundreds of cultists of various ranks under the control of multiple Wearers of Purple.": "邪教行动小组是根据其指定的任务而组建的。他们的规模各不相同，从几个低级别的邪教人员单独行动到数百名不同级别的邪教人员在多名紫袍佩戴者的控制下行动。",
	"The Wearers of Purple stand at the top of the cult's humanoid hierarchy, and their word is law for the cultists in the cities, strongholds, and lairs they command. They are the only members of the cult to wear purple, and most are proud enough to flaunt the color. The Wearers of Purple have an affinity for talking to and negotiating with dragons—the gift of wyrmspeaking. Dozens of Wearers of Purple are spread throughout the Cult of the Dragon, and all are able to marshal the cult's resources.": "紫色穿戴者站在邪教人形等级制度的顶端，他们的话就是他们所指挥的城市、据点和巢穴中的邪教徒的法律。他们是邪教中唯一穿着紫色衣服的成员，而且大多数人都很自豪地炫耀这种颜色。紫色穿戴者有一种与龙交谈和谈判的亲和力--巫妖之语的天赋。数十名紫色穿戴者分布在整个神龙教中，他们都能调集教派的资源。",
	"These four Wearers of Purple are the keepers of the dragon masks and {@creature Severin|RoT}'s most devoted servants in the effort to summon {@creature Tiamat|RoT}. Each of these wyrmspeakers bears one of the dragon masks, which they never part with except under the direst circumstances—and then only at the request of {@creature Severin|RoT} or a draconic ally. The members of the inner circle each have an affinity for a particular color of chromatic dragon. They treat with dragons of those colors to recruit more dragons to the cause, and plan cult missions that advance {@creature Severin|RoT}'s plots.": "这四位紫袍人是龙面具的守护者，也是{@creature Severin|RoT}在召唤{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的努力中最忠实的仆人。每位巫师都有一个龙面具，除非在最糟糕的情况下，否则他们绝不会将其分开，而且只有在{@creature Severin|RoT}或龙族盟友的要求下才会分开。内圈的成员都对一种特定颜色的色龙有亲和力。他们与这些颜色的龙打交道，以招募更多的龙加入，并策划邪教任务，推进{@creature Severin|RoT}的阴谋。",
	"If any wyrmspeakers are killed or captured in your campaign—including Rezmir, who the characters might have defeated in {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}—{@creature Severin|RoT} appoints new followers to his inner council.": "如果任何巫师在你的战役中被杀或被俘--包括在{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}中可能被击败的雷兹米尔--{@creature Severin|RoT}会任命新的追随者进入他的内部委员会。",
	"Cultists are suitable foes for the adventurers in most situations. They keep a low profile in public, so characters are unlikely to see cultists in full regalia on the streets of Waterdeep or Scornubel. As their plots near fruition, however, the cultists grow bolder and might engage the adventurers openly.": "在大多数情况下，邪教徒是冒险者的合适敌人。他们在公共场合保持低调，所以角色们不可能在沃特迪普或斯科努贝尔的街道上看到身着盛装的邪教分子。然而，随着他们的计划接近尾声，邪教徒们会变得更加大胆，并可能与冒险家们公开交锋。",
	"The Red Wizards hail from Thay, over two thousand miles east of the Sword Coast. A grim, dismal region spread across a towering plateau, Thay is defended by an army of undead warriors and ruled by the lich Szass Tam and the zulkirs he appoints to rule over the eight schools of magic. The Red Wizards of Thay are known across Faerûn, and are easily recognized by their distinctive crimson robes and the arcane sigils tattooed onto their shaved heads. Because of their evil reputation, Red Wizards are arrested or killed on the spot in many lands. For that reason, they often travel in disguise, invisibly, or by magical means.": "红袍巫师来自泰伊，在剑海岸以东两千多英里处。泰伊是一个遍布高耸高原的阴森恐怖的地区，由不死族战士组成的军队保卫，并由巫师萨斯-塔姆和他任命的祖尔基尔统治着八个魔法学校。泰伊的红袍巫师在整个法鲁恩都很有名，他们很容易被认出，因为他们穿着独特的深红色长袍，剃光的头上纹着神秘的符号。由于他们的邪恶名声，红袍巫师在许多地方都会被逮捕或当场杀死。出于这个原因，他们经常乔装打扮，隐身，或通过魔法手段出行。",
	"For many years, Szass Tam's grip on absolute power in Thay has been weakened by internal strife. Mortal Red Wizards have risen against their undead masters, destroying some of Szass Tam's lich zulkirs and thinning the ranks of other undead. Little is known of the conflict beyond Thay's borders, however. In this quiet civil war, both sides fear that too much attrition will make Thay a target for its long list of enemies. Szass Tam questions the allegiance of all living Red Wizards outside Thay, and has made it clear that death and worse await any who oppose him.": "多年来，萨斯-塔姆对泰伊绝对权力的控制由于内部纷争而被削弱了。凡人的红袍巫师们已经起来反对他们的亡灵主人，摧毁了萨斯-谭的一些巫师祖尔基尔，并削弱了其他亡灵的队伍。然而，人们对泰伊边界以外的冲突知之甚少。在这场平静的内战中，双方都担心过多的损耗会使泰伊成为其众多敌人的目标。萨斯-塔姆质疑泰伊之外所有活着的红袍巫师的忠诚度，并明确表示，任何反对他的人都将面临死亡和更坏的结果。",
	"The secret cornerstone of this union is Rath Modar's belief that once {@creature Tiamat|RoT} returns, she will see that the Red Wizards are more useful allies than the devoted but magically weak cultists. Rath Modar hopes that {@creature Tiamat|RoT} will show her gratitude for the pivotal role he and his fellow Red Wizards played in her return, granting them an army of dragons with which to assault Thay. After unseating Szass Tam, Rath Modar plans to take his place at the head of all Red Wizards. Whether {@creature Tiamat|RoT} will grant such a reward—or have any further use for the Red Wizards at all—remains unknown.": "这个联盟的秘密基石是拉斯-莫达尔相信，一旦{@creature Tiamat|RoT}回来，她会看到红袍巫师是比那些忠诚但魔法薄弱的邪教徒更有用的盟友。拉斯-莫达尔希望{@creature Tiamat|RoT}会对他和他的红袍巫师同伴在她的回归中所扮演的关键角色表示感谢，给予他们一支龙的军队来攻击泰伊。在推翻萨斯-谭之后，拉斯-莫达尔计划取代他成为所有红袍巫师的首领。{@creature Tiamat|RoT}是否会给予这样的奖励，或者对红袍巫师有任何进一步的利用，目前还不得而知。",
	"{@creature Tiamat|RoT} has long threatened Faerûn, often appearing in lands such as Chessenta and Unther to drive mortals to worship her awesome power. Although mortals don't know it, the end of the Sundering and the Era of Upheaval also put an end to such direct meddling by the gods. Without powerful magic and mortal aid, {@creature Tiamat|RoT} cannot travel from her home in Avernus into the world.": "{@creature Tiamat|RoT}长期以来一直威胁着Faerûn，经常出现在Chessenta和Unther等地，驱使凡人去崇拜她的可怕力量。虽然凡人不知道，但 \"毁灭 \"和 \"动乱时代 \"的结束也终止了诸神的这种直接干预。如果没有强大的魔法和凡人的帮助，{@creature Tiamat|RoT}无法从她在阿弗纳斯的家进入这个世界。",
	"Avernus is a boulder-strewn desolation where fiery comets streak across the sky and devil aristocrats rule from dismal iron fortresses. The River Styx saws a jagged course through Avernus's basalt cliffs, winds its way across ashen plains, and eventually plunges through a yawning pit into the eight levels of the Hells below. All the rivers of Avernus feed into the Styx, each one flowing red with blood beneath a roiling cloud of flies.": "阿弗纳斯是一片巨石遍布的荒芜之地，火红的彗星划过天空，恶魔贵族们在凄凉的铁堡垒中进行统治。冥河在阿弗纳斯的玄武岩悬崖上锯出一条锯齿状的路线，蜿蜒穿过灰暗的平原，最终通过一个大坑坠入下面八层地狱。阿弗纳斯的所有河流都汇入冥河，每条河流都在滚滚的苍蝇云下流淌着红色的血液。",
	"Asmodeus recently reinstated the fallen angel Zariel as the Archduchess of Avernus, reversing an earlier decision that allowed a pit fiend named Bel to take the throne. While in exile from her seat of power, Zariel was at the mercy of {@creature Tiamat|RoT}—a fate that rankles her still. Despite her power as ruler of the first layer of the Nine Hells, Zariel cannot kill the dragon goddess, and she sees the summoning of {@creature Tiamat|RoT} to the world as a way to be rid of her.": "阿斯莫德最近恢复了堕落天使扎里尔作为阿弗纳斯大公夫人的地位，推翻了先前允许一个名为贝尔的坑道恶魔夺取王位的决定。在被流放出她的权力之位时，扎丽尔受到了{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的摆布--这个命运让她至今仍感到不安。尽管她拥有九层地狱第一层统治者的权力，但扎丽尔无法杀死龙神，她把召唤（%%）来到这个世界看作是摆脱她的一种方式。",
	"Ordinarily, the Cult of the Dragon has nothing to do with devils. However, releasing {@creature Tiamat|RoT} into the world is a massive undertaking, and {@creature Severin|RoT} has called on every resource he can. Though many of his allies among the Red Wizards are well schooled in summoning and commanding devils, doing so is never a straightforward process. Devils cannot leave the Nine Hells of their own accord, and though Asmodeus can bend these laws, he seldom does. Most devils in the Material Plane were summoned there by mortal mages who expended tremendous amounts of magical power to breach the barriers that separate the Nine Hells from other planes.": "通常情况下，神龙教与魔鬼没有任何关系。然而，将{@creature Tiamat|RoT}释放到这个世界上是一项巨大的工程，{@creature Severin|RoT}已经调用了他能调用的所有资源。虽然他在红袍巫师中的许多盟友在召唤和指挥魔鬼方面很有经验，但这样做绝不是一个简单的过程。魔鬼不能主动离开九层地狱，尽管阿斯摩德可以弯曲这些法律，但他很少这样做。物质界的大多数魔鬼都是由凡人法师召唤而来，他们耗费了巨大的魔力来突破九幽地狱与其他位面之间的障碍。",
	"Devils in the adventure should always be one step ahead of the adventurers. Characters who like to charge in and decide on strategy later will find that their diabolical foes have well-executed plans. If the characters plan two steps ahead, the devils are one step beyond that. Nothing mortals do should ever surprise them.": "冒险中的魔鬼应该总是比冒险者领先一步。那些喜欢冲锋陷阵，稍后再决定策略的角色会发现，他们的魔鬼敌人有着完善的计划。如果角色们提前两步计划，魔鬼们就会超前一步。凡人所做的任何事情都不应该让他们吃惊。",
	"{@creature Severin|RoT} and his supporters intend to use the ancient draconic artifact known as the {@item Draakhorn|RoT} to rally the chromatic dragons to {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s cause. However, chromatic dragons are notoriously arrogant, territorial, greedy, and suspicious of any creatures begging favors—especially if those creatures might be a threat. Getting dragons to cooperate is a monumental task, even when bringing the Queen of Dragons into the world is the ultimate goal.": "{@creature Severin|RoT}和他的支持者打算利用被称为{@item Draakhorn|RoT}的古老龙族神器，将色龙召集到{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的事业中。然而，色龙是出了名的傲慢、领地、贪婪，而且对任何乞求恩惠的生物都持怀疑态度--尤其是当这些生物可能是一种威胁时。让龙合作是一项艰巨的任务，即使把龙后带入世界是最终目标。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon has a secret weapon for dealing with chromatic dragons, in the form of the five dragon masks. Even with a dragon mask, the process of influencing a dragon remains arduous and dangerous—though the payoff is enormous. These relics give their wearers the ability to communicate with dragons, but more importantly, they impart a subtle influence over dragons that cannot be detected. Dragons cannot be controlled by the masks, but they can be swayed by ideas and proposals that they would not normally find persuasive.": "神龙教有一个对付色龙的秘密武器，就是五个龙形面具。即使有了龙面具，影响龙的过程仍然是艰巨而危险的--尽管回报是巨大的。这些遗物赋予佩戴者与龙沟通的能力，但更重要的是，它们对龙施加了一种无法察觉的微妙影响。龙不能被面具控制，但它们可以被通常认为没有说服力的想法和建议所动摇。",
	"The power of the chromatic dragons is a motif running through every aspect of {@i Tyranny of Dragons: {@i The Rise of Tiamat}.} As the events of the adventure unfold, more and more dragons respond to the {@item Draakhorn|RoT|Draakhorn's} rumbling moan and journey to the Well of Dragons—a migration that inspires alarm and panic in people across Faerûn.": "色素龙的力量是贯穿《{@i Tyranny of Dragons: {@i The Rise of Tiamat}》各个方面的一个主题。｝ 随着冒险事件的展开，越来越多的龙对{@item Draakhorn|RoT|Draakhorn's}隆隆的呻吟声做出反应，并前往龙之井--这种迁移激发了整个法鲁恩的人们的惊慌和恐慌。",
	"Characters and players should seldom be allowed to forget that the evil dragons are on the move. Whenever the adventurers are outside, they might see a dragon winging overhead in the distance. The shadow of a dragon could fall across the adventurers in the daytime, and dark draconic wings might momentarily blot out the moon at night. When the characters arrive in a settlement, they should hear stories about dragon sightings and attacks. When they travel, burned-out hamlets and demolished caravans line the road.": "应该很少让角色和玩家忘记恶龙在移动。只要冒险者在外面，他们就可能看到一条龙在远处的上空飞翔。白天，龙的影子可能会落在冒险者的身上，晚上，黑暗的龙翼可能会瞬间遮住月亮。当人物到达一个定居点时，他们应该听到关于龙的踪迹和攻击的故事。当他们旅行时，烧毁的小村庄和被拆毁的商队会在路上出现。",
	"Dragons are among the oldest, most intelligent, and most powerful monsters in Faerûn and the Dungeons & Dragons game. Chromatic dragons are evil and merciless, and every battle against these creatures should be a life-or-death struggle. No dragon should ever fall without the heroes suffering during the battle. Chromatic dragons use every possible advantage with no regard for fairness, and their chief advantage is flight. A dragon never fights on foot where enemies might hack at it when it can soar majestically out of reach and slaughter foes with its breath weapon. Only in its lair will a dragon typically engage in melee, and then only if its hoard is threatened.": "龙是Faerûn和《龙与地下城》游戏中最古老、最聪明、最强大的怪物之一。色素龙是邪恶和无情的，每一次与这些生物的战斗都应该是一场生死攸关的斗争。在战斗中，没有任何一条龙可以在英雄们不受伤害的情况下倒下。色素龙利用一切可能的优势，不顾公平，而它们的主要优势是飞行。龙从不在敌人可能砍杀它的地方步行作战，因为它可以雄伟地翱翔在敌人的视野之外，用它的呼吸武器屠杀敌人。只有在它的巢穴里，龙才会进行近战，而且只有在它的囤积物受到威胁时才会进行。",
	"Characters who can tackle the challenges of this adventure are high enough level to have allies raised from the dead when those allies fall to a draconic foe. If the characters can't do so themselves, their allies in the Order of the Gauntlet or the Harpers should be willing to help out.": "能够应对这次冒险的挑战的角色等级足够高，当这些盟友倒在龙人的敌人面前时，他们可以让盟友从死里复活。如果角色自己不能这样做，他们在高塔骑士团或哈珀斯的盟友应该会愿意帮忙。",
	"With lifetimes of a thousand years or more to lose, chromatic dragons have no interest in dying in battle against mere humanoids, and they don't sacrifice themselves nobly for any cause—{@creature Tiamat|RoT} included. A dragon caught in a losing battle takes any escape that presents itself, most often simply soaring away. This changes during the final showdown at the Well of Dragons, however, when {@creature Tiamat|RoT} can be seen clawing her way through the portal from the Nine Hells.": "有着一千年或更久的寿命，色龙没有兴趣在与普通人类的战斗中死去，它们不会为任何事业高尚地牺牲自己，包括{@creature Tiamat|RoT}。陷入败局的龙会采取任何逃避的方式，最常见的是简单地腾空而去。然而，在龙之井的最后决战中，这种情况发生了变化，人们可以看到{@creature Tiamat|RoT}在九层地狱的入口处张牙舞爪。",
	"If the characters claimed Skyreach Castle in {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}, they might well hear from a frost giant diplomat who shows up to reclaim it as property of the giants who built it. A frost giant named Harshnag lives on Mount Sar north of Waterdeep, and he is sometimes called upon when the Sword Coast faces dire threats. The player characters could fly the citadel to him or—in a more dramatic interlude—he might come to a council meeting and demand the citadel's return on behalf of his kin so that he might rally them against their ancient foes.": "如果人物在{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}中宣称拥有Skyreach城堡，他们很可能会听到一个冰霜巨人外交官出现，将其作为建造它的巨人的财产收回。一个名叫哈什纳格（Harshnag）的冰霜巨人住在沃特迪普北部的萨尔山上，当剑海岸面临可怕的威胁时，他有时会被召唤。玩家角色可以把城堡飞给他，或者在一个更戏剧性的插曲中，他可能会来参加议会会议，代表他的亲属要求归还城堡，这样他就可以召集他们来对抗他们古老的敌人。",
	"If the player characters did not claim the citadel (or crashed it), this option is not available to them.": "如果玩家角色没有认领城堡（或将其撞毁），他们就不能使用这个选项。",
	"Giants are unlikely to appear side by side with dragons anywhere before the final showdown at the Well of Dragons. However, characters who gain any insight into the giants' alliance with the dragons should understand its apocalyptic significance.": "在龙之井的最后决战之前，巨人不太可能在任何地方与龙并肩出现。然而，对巨人与龙的联盟有任何了解的角色都应该理解其世界末日的意义。",
	"Several powerful organizations battle the Cult of the Dragon even as the party does.

Each faction has a presence in the Council of Waterdeep, and all factions are ultimately on the adventurers' side—even if some of them occasionally hinder the characters more than they help.": "几个强大的组织与神龙教作战，甚至与党派作战。这些角色是剧中的关键人物，但法鲁恩的每个人都与对抗{@creature Tiamat|RoT}和她的盟友的战斗结果有关系。每个派别都在水底议会中占有一席之地，而且所有派别最终都站在冒险者一边--即使他们中的一些人偶尔会阻碍人物而不是帮助他们。",
	"This section describes each faction's goals and driving concerns, its leading delegate or delegates to the council, and what resources it can contribute to the final battle against the Cult of the Dragon.": "本节介绍了每个派别的目标和驱动力，其在议会中的主要代表，以及在与龙神教的最后战斗中可以贡献哪些资源。",
	"The secret society known as the Harpers has been disbanded and rebuilt several times over its long history. The latest incarnation of the group retains its focus on gathering information, keeping a close watch on the balance of power in Faerûn, and promoting fairness and equality in quiet, unobtrusive ways. Harpers try to keep out of the public eye, preferring secrecy to fame and using knowledge to win the day over brute force. However, as the Cult of the Dragon grows more brazen and destructive, the Harpers are forced to act more openly in their opposition.": "被称为哈珀斯的秘密组织在其漫长的历史中已经被解散和重建了好几次。该组织的最新化身仍然专注于收集信息，密切关注法鲁恩的权力平衡，并以安静、不引人注意的方式促进公平和平等。哈珀斯试图远离公众的视线，宁可选择保密也不选择出名，并利用知识来赢得胜利，而不是用蛮力。然而，随着神龙教越来越肆无忌惮和具有破坏性，哈珀人被迫采取更公开的反对行动。",
	"If the characters played through {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}, they've already met one of the most influential of the Harpers: Leosin Erlanthar, a male half-elf monk from Berdusk.": "如果人物玩过了{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}，他们已经见过了哈珀人中最有影响力的一个。Leosin Erlanthar，一个来自Berdusk的男性半精灵修士。",
	"Harper agents operate most effectively alone or in small groups, much like adventurers. When on a mission, they are independent and self-reliant. The ideal Harper is a keen observer, persuasive, and able to go almost anywhere without arousing suspicion.": "哈珀特工单独行动或在小团体中行动最为有效，很像冒险家。在执行任务时，他们是独立和自力更生的。理想的哈珀人是一个敏锐的观察者，有说服力，并且几乎能够去任何地方而不引起怀疑。",
	"NPC Harpers are the kinds of characters who consistently pop up when they're least expected and most useful. If the characters need a safe house in a strange city, are unable to locate an elusive foe, or have been captured by the cult and need inside help to escape, a Harper can offer up a secure hideout, a whispered clue, or a smuggled knife. Bards, mages, and rogues are the most common character types in the Harpers, but characters of every class can be found in the organization.": "NPC哈珀是那种在人们最不期望的时候突然出现的人物，也是最有用的人物。如果角色们在一个陌生的城市需要一个安全的住所，无法找到一个难以捉摸的敌人，或者被邪教抓住了，需要内部帮助才能逃脱，哈珀人可以提供一个安全的藏身之处，一条低声的线索，或者一把走私的刀。吟游诗人、法师和流氓是哈珀人中最常见的角色类型，但每个阶层的角色都可以在该组织中找到。",
	"The elf noble Remallia—\"Remi\" to her friends—is the Harper's leading delegate to the Council of Waterdeep. She is quiet, speaking only after others have had their turn, and is content to let events unfold until she feels a need to offer intervention and guidance. This embodies her attitude about combating the cult as well.": "精灵贵族雷玛利亚--她的朋友们称她为 \"雷米\"--是哈珀家族在水底世界议会的主要代表。她很安静，只有在别人轮到她的时候才发言，并且满足于让事件发展，直到她觉得有必要提供干预和指导。这也体现了她对打击邪教的态度。",
	"Remi is convinced that the rumors of {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s return are true, and she is frustrated by the unwillingness of the other Harpers to commit to fighting the Cult of the Dragon. She understands their hesitation, however. The Harpers' have only recently been reformed, and the cause of their near-destruction was the decision to act more openly and aggressively.": "雷米相信{@creature Tiamat|RoT}回归的传言是真的，她对其他哈珀人不愿意致力于打击龙之教感到沮丧。然而，她理解他们的犹豫不决。哈珀人只是在最近才进行了改革，而导致他们几乎毁灭的原因是决定更公开、更积极地行动。",
	"The Harpers measure success in the value and quantity of intelligence gained by a course of action, as well as how that knowledge can be used to leverage an enemy into submission. Remallia wants the party to succeed using such tactics, knowing that this will sway the conservatives in her faction.": "哈珀人衡量成功的标准是，通过某项行动获得的情报的价值和数量，以及如何利用这些知识来使敌人屈服。雷玛利亚希望党派利用这种战术取得成功，因为她知道这将动摇她派系中的保守派。",
	"The Harpers are willing to cooperate with unsavory types and leverage evil assets, but not if doing so endangers others unnecessarily. They can respect the deftness and skill needed to make such an arrangement, even if they do not like the arrangement itself. The Harpers are always dissatisfied if the characters kill important cultists rather than capturing them—or at least trying to extract information from them beforehand.": "哈珀人愿意与不怀好意的人合作，并利用邪恶的资产，但如果这样做会不必要地危及他人，则不会。他们可以尊重做出这种安排所需的灵活性和技巧，即使他们不喜欢这种安排本身。如果人物杀死了重要的邪教徒而不是抓住他们--或者至少事先试图从他们那里获取信息，哈珀人总是不满意的。",
	"The Order of the Gauntlet shares the Harpers' dedication to justice and equality, but their methods and attitude are quite different.

Evil must be opposed openly and vanquished in the light of day, so that all can see and be emboldened by its destruction.": "高塔骑士团与哈珀斯人一样致力于正义和平等，但他们的方法和态度却截然不同。高塔骑士团的成员都是圣洁的战士，他们正直地追求粉碎邪恶和促进正义，他们从不躲在阴影里。邪恶必须被公开反对，并在光天化日之下被征服，以便所有人都能看到它的毁灭，并为之壮胆。",
	"Members of the order are driven by religious fervor and by devotion to the principle of justice for all. Whether a member places more emphasis on one or the other of those ideals is an individual choice.

	"Before the final battle, members of the order make interesting NPCs for roleplaying encounters because of their outgoing ways and strong opinions. Sharing a roadside inn with twenty paladins from the Order of the Gauntlet, or joining their march for a few days when headed in the same direction, should be a memorable experience.": "在最后的战斗之前，骑士团的成员由于其外向的方式和强烈的意见，成为角色扮演中有趣的NPC。与20名高塔骑士团的圣骑士共用一家路边旅馆，或者在朝同一方向前进时加入他们的行军队伍几天，应该是一次难忘的经历。",

	"Ontharr Frume's dedication to heroic justice creates a strong connection between him and the paladin Sir Isteval. However, Ontharr has difficulty reconciling the heroic Isteval of legend with the diplomatic and retiring figure of the Council of Waterdeep. It's incomprehensible to him why Sir Isteval does not take to the field himself in this great conflict.": "奥瑟尔-弗鲁姆（Ontharr Frume）对英雄正义的献身精神使他与圣骑士伊斯特瓦尔爵士之间产生了强烈的联系。然而，昂赛尔很难将传说中英勇的伊斯特瓦尔与沃特德普议会的外交和隐忍形象相协调。他无法理解为什么伊斯特瓦尔爵士不在这场伟大的冲突中亲自上阵。",
	"The Emerald Enclave is dedicated to maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance.

	"{@creature Severin|RoT}'s plan to release {@creature Tiamat|RoT} from the Nine Hells represents a grave threat to the natural order.

	"Druids, rangers, and barbarians make up most of the Emerald Enclave, but any character with a strong affinity for nature can find a place in the order.": "德鲁伊、游侠和野蛮人构成了翡翠飞地的大部分成员，但任何对自然有强烈亲和力的角色都能在秩序中找到一席之地。",
	"Delaan has come to the Council of Waterdeep as the lone representative of the Emerald Enclave. Even his regular companion, a winter wolf named Loska, remains on patrol outside the city.

He is clearly uncomfortable in Waterdeep.": "德兰作为翡翠飞地的唯一代表来到水底世界的议会。甚至他的固定伙伴，一只名叫洛斯卡的冬狼，也仍然在城外巡逻。德拉恩大部分时间都在北方的荒野上游荡，虽然他每年都会去拜访内斯梅的朋友，但除此之外，他对大型定居点避之不及。他在沃特迪普显然是不舒服的。",
	"There is no question that {@creature Tiamat|RoT} must be stopped, but the Emerald Enclave wants to see the world restored to order. This sometimes means taking a middle ground in battles between good and evil. Delaan is acutely aware of the destruction accompanying the recent activities of the Cult of the Dragon. He knows the cult must be destroyed for upsetting the balance of nature, and he knows that many dragons supporting the cult will die before the end. He would rather not kill unnecessarily, however.": "毫无疑问，{@creature Tiamat|RoT}必须被阻止，但翡翠飞地希望看到世界恢复秩序。这有时意味着在善与恶的斗争中采取中间立场。德兰敏锐地意识到伴随着龙之教最近的活动而产生的破坏。他知道该邪教必须被摧毁，因为它破坏了自然界的平衡，而且他知道许多支持该邪教的龙会在结束前死去。然而，他宁愿不做无谓的杀戮。",
	"Delaan is initially reserved in his support of the party. To earn his respect, the characters must recognize that their battle is not just to save civilization but to preserve the natural order. He thus objects to many actions that good or neutral characters might not think twice about—including destroying chromatic dragon eggs and other acts that disrupt the natural cycle.": "Delaan最初对党的支持有所保留。为了赢得他的尊重，角色们必须认识到他们的战斗不仅仅是为了拯救文明，而是为了保护自然秩序。因此，他反对许多善良或中立的角色可能不会考虑的行为--包括摧毁色龙蛋和其他破坏自然循环的行为。",
	"\"The Lords' Alliance\" is not a metaphor. This organization was created and is led by leaders and nobles from across Faerûn. Although many of its members have conflicting goals and long-standing rivalries outside the alliance, they band together in the face of events that are too big for any of them to handle on their own. The rulers of Waterdeep, Silverymoon, Baldur's Gate, and other cities, families, and trading houses of the Sword Coast might never set aside their differences, but they can pull together when the survival of all depends on it.": "\"领主联盟 \"并不是一个比喻。这个组织是由来自法鲁恩各地的领袖和贵族创建并领导的。虽然它的许多成员在联盟之外有着相互冲突的目标和长期的竞争，但在面对他们中的任何一个人都无法独立处理的大事件时，他们团结起来。水底城、银月城、博德之门以及剑海岸的其他城市、家族和商行的统治者们可能永远不会搁置他们的分歧，但当所有人的生存都取决于此时，他们可以团结起来。",
	"The Lords' Alliance represents the richest interests and the most powerful armies on the Sword Coast. The order controls wealth that can hire mercenaries, ensure the loyalty of wavering princes, and possibly even bribe a few chromatic dragons to switch sides or break from {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s cause. Without the help of the alliance against the Cult of the Dragon, the Dragon Queen's victory might be assured.": "领主联盟代表了剑岸上最富有的利益集团和最强大的军队。该组织控制着财富，可以雇佣雇佣兵，确保动摇的王子们的忠诚，甚至可能贿赂一些色龙，让他们转换立场或脱离{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的事业。如果没有联盟对神龙教的帮助，龙后的胜利可能是有把握的。",
	"Even while they are working together, members of the Lords' Alliance are always advancing their own interests. Everyone knows and expects it—it's a fact of dealing with the alliance. That doesn't mean member cities don't cooperate and help each other in times of crisis.

For anyone to move up, someone else must move down.": "即使他们在一起工作，领主联盟的成员也总是在推进自己的利益。每个人都知道并期待着这一点--这是与联盟打交道的一个事实。这并不意味着成员城市在危机时不合作和互相帮助。但如果一场危机重新安排了剑海岸的权力结构，所有参与其中的人都希望新的秩序能让他们过得更好。任何人要向上发展，其他人就必须向下发展。",
	"Whenever a military campaign is underway, the Lords' Alliance is likely to be in command. Even if it isn't, alliance representatives will be on hand to observe and advise. If the characters find themselves in legal trouble, a councilor might come to the party's aid with a writ of pardon.": "每当有军事行动进行时，领主联盟很可能处于指挥地位。即使不是这样，联盟的代表也会在一旁观察并提供建议。如果角色们发现自己遇到了法律上的麻烦，一位议员可能会带着赦免令来帮助他们。",
	"Fighters and sorcerers are plentiful in the Lords' Alliance, but the order takes on any character who feels at home in civilized lands. Barbarians, rangers, and druids are seldom involved with this faction, which sometimes leads to strained relations with the Emerald Enclave.": "在领主联盟中，战士和巫师很多，但该组织也接受任何在文明土地上感到自在的角色。野蛮人、游侠和德鲁伊很少参与这个派别，这有时会导致与翡翠飞地的关系紧张。",
	"Because the Lords' Alliance is a confederation, the order sends seven delegates to the Council of Waterdeep, each effectively representing his or her own faction. Their diverse character, motivations, and obligations ensure that they are not in agreement about the current threat facing Faerûn. Moreover, the standing of certain delegates changes from one council to the next.": "由于领主联盟是一个联盟，该组织向水底城议会派出了七名代表，每个人都有效地代表自己的派系。他们的性格、动机和义务各不相同，这确保了他们对法鲁恩目前面临的威胁意见不一。此外，某些代表的地位在不同的议会中会发生变化。",
	"Although it is not necessary for all delegates to back the adventurers, without at least some support from the Lords' Alliance, there is almost no way for the party to marshal enough forces to win the day.": "虽然没有必要让所有代表都支持冒险家，但如果没有至少来自领主联盟的一些支持，该党几乎没有办法调集足够的力量来赢得这场比赛。",
	"Lady Laeral is present starting with the second council, at which point she becomes the Open Lord of Waterdeep. She is one of the Seven Sisters—legendary, nigh-immortal figures known to have been blessed by Mystra. (Some even say they are the goddess's daughters.) Her spellcasting ability is impressive but is beginning to wane, and she focuses more on political power than on the arcane these days. The Masked Lords of Waterdeep choose her as the successor to Dagult Neverember between the first and second sessions of the Council of Waterdeep, making her the leader of the Lords' Alliance.": "拉伊尔夫人从第二次议会开始出现，此时她成为水底世界的公开领主。她是七姐妹之一--传说中的、近乎不朽的人物，众所周知，她受到了神秘拉的祝福。(她的法术能力令人印象深刻，但已经开始减弱，而且她现在更关注政治权力而不是奥术。沃特德普的蒙面领主们在沃特德普议会第一届和第二届会议之间选择了她作为达古特-纽伦堡的继承人，使她成为领主联盟的领袖。",
	"Laeral Silverhand brings centuries of leadership experience and an impressive reputation to the negotiations. A consummate diplomat, she can wield words that wound or soothe with equal ease. As the Open Lord of Waterdeep, she holds great sway with all the delegates except Dagult Neverember, who believes that she engineered his removal from the position of Open Lord.": "Laeral Silverhand为谈判带来了几个世纪的领导经验和令人印象深刻的声誉。作为一个完美的外交家，她可以轻松地挥舞话语，使人受伤或舒缓。作为沃特德普的开放领主，她在所有的代表中都有很大的影响力，除了达古特-纽伦堡（Dagult Neverember），他认为是她策划了将他从开放领主的位置上撤下来。",
	"If the adventurers sway Laeral to their side, she speaks highly of the party in the periods between council sessions. Having the support of the leader of the Lords' Alliance increases the party's stature in the eyes of all other factions, granting additional bonuses. See \"{@adventure Chapter 9: Council of Waterdeep|RoT|1}\" and the Council Scorecard ({@adventure appendix B|HotDQ|10}) for more information.": "如果冒险者将拉伊尔拉到自己一边，她就会在议会闭会期间对该党进行高度评价。得到领主联盟领袖的支持，会提高该党在所有其他派别眼中的地位，并给予额外的奖励。更多信息见\"{@adventure Chapter 9: Council of Waterdeep|RoT|1} \"和议会记分卡（{@adventure appendix B|HotDQ|10}）。",
	"Lord Neverember holds many titles and wears several crowns. During the first council, he is the Open Lord of Waterdeep, the Lord Protector of Neverwinter, and leader of the Lords' Alliance. He looks the part of such an impressively titled figure: tall and broad-shouldered, with a thick beard, a wild mane of hair, and a forceful manner. Rarely seen without his hand around a glass of strong spirits, he is a master manipulator and looks and behaves as a king should.": "永恒之城领主拥有许多头衔，戴着好几顶皇冠。在第一次议会中，他是水底世界的公开领主，永夜的保护者，以及领主联盟的领袖。他看起来就是这样一个令人印象深刻的头衔：高大宽阔的肩膀，浓密的胡须，狂野的头发，以及强硬的态度。他是一个操纵者，看起来和行为都是一个国王应该做的。",
	"Strong and decisive, Dagult acts always for the good of his subjects and realm—and in doing so, has consistently built up his own power and wealth. Unfortunately for him, the Masked Lords of Waterdeep have recently chosen to replace him as Open Lord. Laeral Silverhand, his successor, claims her title in the second council meeting.": "强大而果断的达古特总是为了他的臣民和王国的利益而行动--在这样做的过程中，他一直在建立自己的权力和财富。不幸的是，沃特德普的蒙面领主们最近选择取代他成为开放领主。Laeral Silverhand，他的继任者，在第二次议会会议上声称她的头衔。",
	"Dagult demands order and rewards discipline, but he is pragmatic and driven by results above all else. He knows that nothing comes without effort, and sacrifices must be made when necessary. Tireless in his actions, he never stops until he has achieved his goals. He will use any means at his disposal, as long as those means are legally justifiable—even when such justification must be \"rediscovered\" from long-forgotten or ignored laws.": "达古特要求秩序，奖励纪律，但他是务实的，以结果为导向，高于一切。他知道没有什么是不劳而获的，必要时必须做出牺牲。他的行动不知疲倦，不达目的决不罢休。他将使用他所掌握的任何手段，只要这些手段在法律上是合理的--即使这种合理性必须从早已被遗忘或忽视的法律中 \"重新发现 \"出来。",
	"In the first council meeting, Lord Dagult's resources have been spread thin between the massive investments he's made in rebuilding Neverwinter and in maintaining dominance in Waterdeep. He strongly supports the members of the Lords' Alliance pooling resources, because he worries that neither of his investments can survive the coming catastrophe without assistance. This changes by the second council. Though losing Waterdeep allows him to consolidate his strength, Dagult resents Laeral for taking his position. He avoids letting his feelings cloud his judgment, however, intent on showing that he is a more fitting leader by backing the adventurers and taking a firm leadership role in the council.": "在第一次议会会议上，达古特领主在重建永夜城和维持沃特德普的统治方面进行了大量投资，他的资源已经被分散。他强烈支持领主联盟的成员集中资源，因为他担心如果没有援助，他的任何投资都无法在即将到来的灾难中生存。这种情况在第二次议会时有所改变。虽然失去沃特德普让他巩固了自己的实力，但达古特对拉伊尔抢走他的位置感到不满。然而，他避免让他的感情影响他的判断，而是打算通过支持冒险者和在议会中发挥坚定的领导作用来显示他是一个更合适的领导者。",

	"Even though Connerad hates dragons, devils, and cultists alike, he is as stubborn as a mule about committing troops anywhere but his homeland. The dwarven kingdoms in the North have lost many people in recent years, and the dwarves that remain are struggling to retain ancient lands only recently reclaimed. He knows the adventurers only by reputation, and desires tangible proof that they have the mettle and wits to lead soldiers and dwarves before he'll make a serious commitment. Like Ontharr Frume of the Order of the Gauntlet, Connerad responds well to bold demonstrations of heroism. However, he is personally and deeply insulted by any slight against dwarves or intrusions by the characters into dwarven affairs. His reactions to the adventurers' exploits determine how he votes in the fourth council.": "尽管康纳德憎恨龙、魔鬼和邪教徒，但他像骡子一样顽固，不愿意在除故乡之外的任何地方投入军队。北方的矮人王国近年来失去了很多人，而留下来的矮人正在努力保留最近才收回的古老土地。他对冒险者的了解仅仅来自于声誉，他希望在做出严肃的承诺之前，能够切实证明他们有能力和智慧来领导士兵和矮人。就像高塔骑士团的昂赛尔-弗鲁姆（Ontharr Frume）一样，康纳德对大胆的英雄主义表现反应良好。然而，对于任何针对矮人的轻视或人物对矮人事务的侵入，他个人都会受到深深的侮辱。他对冒险家们的表现的反应决定了他在第四届议会中的投票情况。",
	"Ulder Ravengard is the leader of the Flaming Fist—the military might of Baldur's Gate. He has the greatest martial acumen of anyone at the council (and probably in the whole Lords' Alliance). He can also muster more soldiers than any other delegate, and he is not bashful about saying so. His place is at the head of the war council and the front of the battle—but he will take that place only if the party proves worthy of his trust.": "Ulder Ravengard是火焰之拳的领袖--博德之门的军事力量。他是议会中最有军事头脑的人（可能也是整个领主联盟的人）。他还能召集比任何其他代表更多的士兵，而且他也不吝于这样说。他的位置是战争委员会的领导，也是战斗的前线--但他只有在当事人证明值得他信任的情况下才会担任这个位置。",
	"Ravengard is a stern warrior dedicated to discipline and results. Having risen through the ranks of the Flaming Fist by the might of his blade and the sharpness of his wits, he sometimes lacks sophistication and tact, but he possesses an unwavering commitment to the law. More comfortable working with soldiers than adventurers, Ravengard is used to giving orders and having them obeyed without question.": "拉文加德是一个致力于纪律和结果的严厉的战士。在火焰之拳的队伍中，他靠着刀剑的威力和智慧的敏锐度不断晋升，有时缺乏成熟和策略，但他拥有对法律坚定不移的承诺。与冒险者相比，拉文加德更喜欢与士兵一起工作，他习惯于下达命令并让他们毫无疑问地服从。",
	"Though Baldur's Gate is still recovering from the havoc caused by the resurrection within the city of Bhaal, god of murder, the metropolis remains one of Faerûn's most populous, wealthy, and powerful cities. Ravengard recognizes his duty to protect the city above all else, and the Flaming Fist's tired reserves are desperately needed for reconstruction and policing. However, he would love to see the Flaming Fist take a leading role in the fight against the Cult of the Dragon, if only to give the defenders of Baldur's Gate a stature befitting the greatest city in Faerûn. This opportunity for glory makes Ravengard receptive to the adventurers' overtures, as long as their plans and decisions promise stability and discipline.": "虽然博德之门仍在从谋杀之神巴尔的城市内的复活所造成的破坏中恢复，但这座大都市仍然是法鲁恩人口最多、最富裕、最强大的城市之一。拉文加德认识到他有责任保护这座城市，而火焰之拳的疲惫储备也亟需用于重建和维持治安。然而，他很想看到火焰之拳在与龙之崇拜的斗争中发挥主导作用，哪怕只是为了让博德之门的守卫者拥有与法鲁恩最伟大城市相称的地位。只要冒险者的计划和决定能保证稳定和纪律，这种荣耀的机会让拉文加德接受了冒险者的请求。",
	"The King of the Misty Forest is the delegate for the elves of both the Misty Forest and the High Forest. Whereas his sons Alagarthas and {@creature Neronvain|RoT} always rushed headlong into their own pursuits, Melandrach is more circumspect. He has led the elves of the Misty Forest since before most of their kind abandoned their lands in the Retreat. Despite the years of discussion and meditation that preceded it, Melandrach considered the Retreat a rash decision, and he is understandably hesitant to commit to any sudden course of action.": "迷雾森林的国王是迷雾森林和高级森林的精灵的代表。他的儿子阿拉格萨斯和{@creature Neronvain|RoT}总是一头扎进自己的追求中，而梅兰德斯则比较谨慎。他从大多数同类放弃他们在撤退区的土地之前就开始领导迷雾森林的精灵们了。尽管之前经过多年的讨论和冥想，梅兰德斯认为撤退是一个轻率的决定，他对任何突然的行动方案都感到犹豫，这是可以理解的。",
	"Silverymoon has a large army and many wizards who would greatly assist in the coming battle, but Taern has not lived this long by being rash. He is one of the most cautious delegates, knowing that Silverymoon's great wards of protection have stood against dragons before. Fearing that committing soldiers to the effort against the Cult of the Dragon might leave the city weakened, Taern needs to know that the party will protect any troops he lends to the coalition. As such, he seeks to gather as much information as possible about the adventurers and other potential allies.": "银月有一支庞大的军队和许多巫师，他们会在即将到来的战斗中提供极大的帮助，但泰恩并不是因为轻率而活了这么久。他是最谨慎的代表之一，因为他知道银月城的巨大保护屏障以前曾抵御过龙。由于担心将士兵投入到对抗龙神教的工作中可能会使城市受到削弱，泰恩需要知道，党会保护他借给联盟的任何部队。因此，他试图尽可能多地收集关于冒险者和其他潜在盟友的信息。",
	"Sir Isteval is a former adventurer and Purple Dragon Knight of Cormyr. Though not an actual member of the Lords' Alliance, he is present at the Council of Waterdeep as the alliance's nominal representative for Daggerford. That small settlement can contribute little to the effort to defeat the Cult of the Dragon, however, and in truth, Isteval has been drafted by Cormyr to gain insight into what looks to be a war brewing on its western border.": "伊斯特瓦尔爵士是一位前冒险家和科米尔的紫龙骑士。虽然他不是领主联盟的实际成员，但他作为联盟名义上的达格福特代表出席了沃特德普的议会。然而，这个小定居点对打败龙之崇拜的努力贡献不大，事实上，伊斯特瓦尔被科米尔征召，以深入了解其西部边境上似乎正在酝酿的一场战争。",
	"Isteval has too much respect for the other delegates to hide this information from them, and he assures those present that his loyalties—to Daggerford, to Cormyr, to the Lords' Alliance, and to all good folk—are not at cross-purposes. This forthright approach nevertheless causes an uproar among other delegates, and the adventurers must take a hand in insuring that Isteval is not expelled from the council meetings.": "伊斯特瓦尔非常尊重其他代表，不会对他们隐瞒这些信息，他向在场的人保证，他对达格福特、科米尔、领主联盟和所有善良的人们的忠诚并不相悖。但这种直截了当的做法还是在其他代表中引起了骚动，冒险家们必须参与其中，以确保伊斯特瓦尔不被驱逐出议会会议。",
	"A veteran dragon slayer, Isteval bears a wound in his leg that resists magical healing, and he walks with a cane made from a bone of the green dragon that dealt him the injury. The paladin can be a helpful source of dragon lore, but his advice is always guarded. He sees his infirmity as a reminder from his god Lathander of the dangers of hubris. As befits his deity's ethos, Isteval has chosen to treat his injury as a reason to encourage the heroics of others even as his own legend fades. Still, at times like these when the world needs heroes, he doesn't like being reminded that he must watch the fight from the sidelines.": "作为一名资深的屠龙者，伊斯特瓦尔的腿上有一道伤口，可以抵抗魔法的治疗，他用一根绿龙的骨头做成的手杖行走。这位圣骑士可以成为龙的传说的有用来源，但他的建议总是受到保护。他认为自己的虚弱是他的神Lathander对傲慢的危险的一种提醒。与他的神的精神相称，伊斯特瓦尔选择把他的伤痛当作鼓励他人的英雄事迹的理由，即使他自己的传说已经消失。不过，在这种世界需要英雄的时候，他并不喜欢被提醒他必须在一旁观战。",
	"Isteval believes in heroes as the spark that can ignite the flames of righteousness in others and the light that chases away the darkness of evil. Seeing this spark in the adventurers makes the paladin one of the party's strongest advocates at the Council of Waterdeep, as long as they pursue a principled path.": "伊斯特瓦尔相信英雄是能够点燃他人正义之火的火花，是驱赶邪恶黑暗的光芒。看到冒险者身上的这种火花，使圣骑士成为党在沃特德普议会最有力的支持者之一，只要他们追求有原则的道路。",
	"Sir Isteval has much in common with Ontharr Frume of the Order of the Gauntlet. The two are potential allies in all things, which worries some of the other Lords' Alliance members.": "伊斯特瓦尔爵士与高塔骑士团的昂赛尔-弗鲁姆有很多共同点。两人在所有事情上都是潜在的盟友，这让其他一些领主联盟的成员感到担忧。",
	"The Zhentarim—also known as the Black Network—is a loose affiliation of merchants, mercenaries, and malefactors. Common folk know the Zhentarim as the people to talk to when you need the best guards or mercenaries money can buy. And if the cargo is shady or the cause you're fighting for is questionable or even unjust, the Zhentarim don't mind.": "Zhentarim--也被称为黑网--是一个由商人、雇佣兵和恶棍组成的松散联盟。普通人都知道，当你需要用钱买到最好的警卫或雇佣兵时，可以和Zhentarim谈谈。如果货物有问题，或者你为之奋斗的事业有问题，甚至是不公正的，Zhentarim也不会介意。",
	"Affiliation with the Zhentarim can be profitable to sellswords, thieves, and rogues of every stripe. It's plausible that adventurers in your campaign might become members of the organization—but like most residents of Faerûn, they won't know the full extent of the Zhentarim's operations and goals.": "隶属于Zhentarim的组织对各种类型的卖家、盗贼和流氓来说都是有利可图的。在你的活动中，冒险者有可能成为该组织的成员，但就像法鲁恩的大多数居民一样，他们并不了解Zhentarim的全部活动和目标。",
	"Unknown to all but a few, the heart of the Zhentarim is a cabal of evil and sometimes monstrous leaders who seek to extend the Black Network's blood-soaked reach into every assassination, black market, and illegal deal that happens in Faerûn. The order's criminal connections burrow into every major city and thieves' guild in the Western Heartlands and along the Sword Coast. Wherever a city's coinage is disastrously undermined by counterfeiting, wherever an up-and-coming business runs roughshod over its established competitors, and wherever a political struggle turns to widespread intimidation, it's a safe bet that the Zhentarim are involved.": "除了少数人之外，根塔林的核心是一个由邪恶的、有时是畸形的领导人组成的阴谋集团，他们试图将黑色网络的血腥触角延伸到法鲁恩的每一次暗杀、黑市和非法交易中。该组织的犯罪关系深入到西部心脏地带和剑海岸的每个主要城市和盗贼公会。每当一个城市的钱币因造假而遭到灾难性破坏，每当一个新兴企业对其成熟的竞争对手采取粗暴手段，每当一场政治斗争演变成广泛的恐吓，都可以肯定根塔林会参与其中。",
	"This viewpoint makes the Zhentarim an interesting addition to the characters' possible allies. Under normal circumstances, the Harpers, the Lords' Alliance, the Order of the Gauntlet, and the Emerald Enclave would shun ties to the Black Network—and possibly arrest its emissaries. However, the crisis created by the Cult of the Dragon is unprecedented. Every resource that can be mustered will be needed in the final showdown against the cult, and the Zhentarim's network of spies, assassins, and mercenary armies cannot be ignored.": "这种观点使赞塔林成为人物可能的盟友中一个有趣的补充。在正常情况下，哈珀人（Harpers）、领主联盟（Lords' Alliance）、高塔骑士团（Order of the Gauntlet）和翡翠飞地（Emerald Enclave）会回避与黑网的关系，并可能逮捕其使者。然而，神龙教造成的危机是空前的。在与该邪教的最后决战中，将需要每一种可以调动的资源，而镇塔林的间谍、刺客和雇佣军网络是不容忽视的。",
	"Even with the fate of the world and the Zhentarim's own future hanging in the balance, the order demands payment for services—and where need and risk are greatest, the pay is expected to be equally great. This mercenary attitude does not sit well with the Lords' Alliance, however, and they are the only group with the resources to pay the Black Network's price. The heroes can attempt to sway the opinions of the other factions—and have a chance to buy the Zhentarim's allegiance outright in the follow-up to {@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}.": "即使世界的命运和Zhentarim自己的未来都岌岌可危，该组织仍要求为服务付费--在需求和风险最大的地方，报酬也会同样巨大。然而，这种雇佣兵的态度让领主联盟很不满意，他们是唯一有资源来支付黑网代价的团体。英雄们可以尝试动摇其他派别的意见--并且有机会在后续的{@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}中直接买下赞塔林的效忠。",
	"In the end, too much is at stake to sit this fight out, and the Zhentarim pitch in against the cult regardless of whether their price is paid. However, if the other factions want a voice in how the Zhentarim go to war against the cult, it will cost them. If the Zhentarim fight on their own, they strike when and how they choose.": "最后，这场战斗的利害关系太大了，无论是否付出代价，Zhentarim都会投向邪教。然而，如果其他派别想在根塔林人如何与邪教开战的问题上有发言权，他们就会付出代价。如果Zhentarim独立作战，他们会在自己选择的时间和方式上进行打击。",
	"Black Network agents are useful NPCs that you can introduce at appropriate times during the adventure. Characters who played {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ} have already met one member of the Black Network—the female gnome Jamna Gleamsilver. If the characters need information or gear they can't obtain any other way, seeking out or being approached by a Zhentarim agent is an easy way for you to provide it.": "黑网特工是有用的NPC，你可以在冒险过程中的适当时候介绍他们。玩过{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}的角色已经见过黑网的一个成员--女地精Jamna Gleamsilver。如果角色需要他们无法通过其他方式获得的信息或装备，寻找或被一个Zhentarim特工接近是你提供信息的一个简单方法。",
	"A typical Black Network agent is a highly capable adventurer with no scruples. Some Zhentarim have winged snake companions that carry messages on scrolls as they fly, allowing agents to keep in contact with one another.": "一个典型的黑网特工是一个能力很强的冒险家，没有任何顾忌。一些真塔林人有带翅膀的蛇伙伴，它们在飞行时将信息写在卷轴上，使特工们能够保持彼此的联系。",
	"Although the Zhentarim as a whole oppose the cult's plans, not everyone in the Black Network shares that view. A number of Zhentarim agents believe that the cult's victory is inevitable, and that by standing against the cult, the Zhentarim risk losing everything. If events are going too smoothly for the heroes, you can introduce a few rogue Black Network agents to throw a wrench into the characters' plans at the worst possible moment.": "虽然根塔林作为一个整体反对邪教的计划，但在黑色网络中并不是每个人都赞同这种观点。一些Zhentarim特工认为，邪教的胜利是不可避免的，如果站在邪教的对立面，Zhentarim有可能失去一切。如果事件对英雄们来说太顺利了，你可以引入几个流氓黑网特工，在最糟糕的时刻给人物的计划带来麻烦。",
	"Rian is a member of the Zhentarim and the Black Network's envoy during the third Council of Waterdeep. She is seated at the table as a special adviser to Lord Neverember, and her affiliation with the Zhentarim will not be mentioned. However, neither she nor Lord Neverember try to deny or conceal that affiliation if the characters question why Rian is present.": "里安是根塔林的成员，也是黑网在第三届沃特德普议会中的特使。她作为纽文伯领主的特别顾问坐在会议桌前，她与根塔林的关系不会被提及。然而，如果角色们质疑里安的存在，她和纽文伯领主都不会试图否认或隐瞒这种关系。",
	"The Black Network backs any plans that increase the likelihood of defeating the cult. Any and all alliances are fine, as are any outcomes that add to the council's strategic resources. Rian doesn't have any particular interest in morality, and dark acts have no impact on her attitude toward the party. She disapproves of taking any wyrmspeakers alive, though, fearing the power of such dangerous figures and questioning the chance of success for attempts to turn or interrogate them. She favors discreet execution, interrogation of the corpse with appropriate rituals, and destruction of the body to prevent resurrection.": "黑网支持任何增加击败邪教的可能性的计划。任何和所有的联盟都没有问题，任何能增加理事会战略资源的结果也是如此。里安对道德没有任何特别的兴趣，黑暗行为对她对党的态度没有任何影响。但她不赞成活捉任何讲巫术的人，因为她害怕这种危险人物的力量，并对试图策反或审讯他们的成功率表示怀疑。她倾向于谨慎地处决，用适当的仪式审问尸体，并销毁尸体以防止复活。",
	"The Black Network remains uncommitted until the final council when pledges are made. If the party has earned the Zhentarim's respect, they provide their services at only a nominal cost. However, such action almost certainly alienates most of the other factions from the adventurers. Unlike the other factions, the Zhentarim's loyalty can be purchased regardless of their respect for the characters, if the party can negotiate terms to be paid by the other factions.": "黑网在最后的议会上作出承诺之前，一直没有作出承诺。如果队伍赢得了赞塔林的尊重，他们只需付出象征性的代价就能提供服务。然而，这样的行动几乎肯定会使大多数其他派系与冒险者疏远。与其他派别不同的是，不管他们对角色的尊重程度如何，如果党派能够谈判出由其他派别支付的条件，那么就可以买到Zhentarim的忠诚度。",
	"The good dragons of Faerûn hear the {@i Draakhorn's} call and know what it portends. With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, the good dragons will take action to oppose the return of {@creature Tiamat|RoT}. However, it remains to be seen whether they do so in concert with the humanoid factions of the Sword Coast, or whether they strike on their own with no thought or concern for the fate of the lesser races.": "法鲁恩的好龙们听到了{@i Draakhorn's}的召唤，知道它预示着什么。由于世界的命运悬而未决，好龙们将采取行动反对{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的回归。然而，他们是与剑海岸的人形派别协同行动，还是不顾较小种族的命运而独自行动，还有待观察。",
	"Though many giants have thrown their lot in with the Cult of the Dragon, most remember the ancient dragon-giant wars with bitterness and hatred. Tales of feuds, bloodletting, and death fuel the giants' hatred of dragons, but the giant races are their own masters. As such, they don't easily cooperate with the small races. Even when good giants see the need and wisdom in joining forces with lesser folk, they often resist the idea out of pride until someone or something can command their respect.": "虽然很多巨人都投靠了龙之教，但大多数人对古代龙-巨人战争的记忆是痛苦和仇恨的。关于仇杀、流血和死亡的故事加剧了巨人对龙的仇恨，但巨人种族是他们自己的主人。因此，他们不轻易与小种族合作。即使善良的巨人看到了与小民族联合的必要性和智慧，他们也常常出于骄傲而抵制这种想法，直到有人或事能得到他们的尊重。",
	"Engaging the giants in an alliance against the Cult of the Dragon can be handled by NPCs (most likely by members of the Harpers or the Emerald Enclave). If the characters completed {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ} in possession of Skyreach Castle, offering to return it to the giants (either behind the scenes or in a side trek chapter of your own creation) is sure to guarantee their support of the factions against the Cult of the Dragon. The presence of giants at the final showdown will be an enormous advantage for the forces fighting against the cult.": "与巨人结盟对抗龙之崇拜，可以由NPC处理（很可能是哈珀斯或翡翠飞地的成员）。如果人物完成了{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}拥有Skyreach城堡，提出把它还给巨人（无论是在幕后还是在你自己创造的侧面跋涉章节），肯定会保证他们支持各派别对抗龙神教。巨人出现在最后的决战中，将是对抗邪教的部队的一个巨大优势。",
	"{@i The Rise of Tiamat} begins immediately after the conclusion of {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}, and assumes that the characters have returned to Waterdeep in the aftermath of that adventure. While in the city, the adventurers are summoned to the first meeting of the Council of Waterdeep. While at that gathering, they hear the sounding of the ancient {@item Draakhorn|RoT} that heralds the next stage of the Cult of the Dragon's plots. (See {@adventure Chapter 17|RoT|8} for more information on the {@item Draakhorn|RoT}, but be sure to withhold that information until the characters have played through the \"{@adventure Chapter 10: The Sea of Moving Ice|RoT|2}.\")": "{@i The Rise of Tiamat}在{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}结束后立即开始，并假设角色在那次冒险之后回到了沃特德普。在这座城市里，冒险者们被召集参加沃特德普议会的第一次会议。在那次会议上，他们听到了古老的{@item Draakhorn|RoT}的声音，预示着神龙教的下一阶段的阴谋。(关于{@item Draakhorn|RoT}的更多信息，请参见{@adventure Chapter 17|RoT|8}，但一定要在角色玩过\"{@adventure Chapter 10: The Sea of Moving Ice|RoT|2} \"之后再告知。)",
	"{@i The Rise of Tiamat} begins in Waterdeep. If you played {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}, the characters might have already made their way back to the City of Splendors after Skyreach Castle crashed at the end of that first adventure. If you didn't play {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}, if Skyreach Castle wasn't crashed, or if the characters went somewhere other than Waterdeep afterward, you need to get the party back to Waterdeep for the start of this adventure.": "{@i The Rise of Tiamat}开始于Waterdeep。如果你玩过{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}，在第一次冒险结束时，Skyreach城堡坠毁后，人物可能已经回到了辉煌之城。如果你没有玩{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}，如果Skyreach城堡没有坠毁，或者如果人物后来去了Waterdeep以外的地方，你需要让队伍回到Waterdeep来开始这次冒险。",
	"It's easy enough to simply tell the players that their characters are back in Waterdeep. However, if you suspect that your group won't find that satisfying, you can avoid playing through a long overland journey by making use of the following scenario.": "简单地告诉玩家他们的角色回到了Waterdeep，这很容易。然而，如果你怀疑你的小组不会觉得满意，你可以通过利用下面的场景来避免玩一个漫长的陆路旅行。",
	"Wherever the characters are when this session begins, a raven flies up to them. The bird is part of an {@spell animal messenger} relay dispatched by Leosin Erlanthar's allies in the Emerald Enclave.": "当这个环节开始时，无论角色在哪里，一只乌鸦都会飞到他们面前。这只鸟是Leosin Erlanthar在翡翠飞地的盟友派出的{@spell animal messenger}中继站的一部分。",
	"The raven lands a dozen paces from you, then boldly hops closer, a flat parcel wrapped in oilskin strapped to its belly. It eyes you enigmatically for a few moments, then speaks in a familiar voice. \"Leosin Erlanthar sends his heartiest congratulations! Please use the gift this bird brings to meet me in Waterdeep as soon as possible.\"": "乌鸦在离你十几步远的地方降落，然后大胆地跳近，它的肚子上绑着一个用油皮包裹的扁平包裹。它神秘地看了你一会儿，然后用熟悉的声音说话。\"Leosin Erlanthar向你致以最诚挚的祝贺! 请使用这只鸟带来的礼物，尽快到水底世界来见我。\"",
	"The bird waits patiently while the leather parcel is removed from its harness. The parcel contains a carefully folded {@item spell scroll} of {@spell teleport} and the sigil sequence of a permanent teleport circle in Waterdeep. The circle can be in a temple, a government building, or any other site of your choice. If the party includes more than six characters, the parcel contains two scrolls. If none of the characters can use a {@spell teleport} scroll, they'll need to seek out an NPC who can. Just don't make it too difficult.": "这只鸟耐心地等待着，而皮革包裹则从它的马具上取下。包裹里有一张精心折叠的{@item spell scroll}的{@spell teleport}，以及沃特德普的永久传送圈的标志序列。这个圈子可以在寺庙、政府大楼或你选择的任何其他地点。如果队伍里有六个以上的人物，包裹里就有两个卷轴。如果没有一个角色可以使用{@spell teleport}卷轴，他们就需要寻找一个可以使用的NPC。不要让它变得太难。",
	"The most powerful factions of the Sword Coast all recognize the significance of {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s possible return, and they are willing to cooperate with each other to prevent it. Trust doesn't come easily for these disparate groups. But even for orders and organizations that have been in conflict in the past, the \"enemy of my enemy\" is easily understood.": "剑海岸最强大的派别都认识到{@creature Tiamat|RoT}可能回归的重要性，他们愿意相互合作来阻止它。对于这些不同的团体来说，信任来得并不容易。但即使对于过去有冲突的命令和组织，\"敌人的敌人 \"也很容易理解。",
	"To coordinate their efforts against the Cult of the Dragon, the factions have sent important delegates for secret meetings in Waterdeep. If the adventurers played through {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}, they now know as much as anyone about the cult's activities, and their heroics have been brought to the attention of powerful leaders and earned them a place at the council table. If you didn't play {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}, a separate group of heroes assaulted Skyreach Castle and bravely gave their lives to crash the fortress. The characters are then invited to the council simply because of their reputation as powerful adventurers, and because the council expects to need their services.": "为了协调他们对龙之崇拜的努力，各派别都派出了重要的代表，在沃特迪普召开秘密会议。如果冒险者玩过{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}，他们现在对邪教的活动了解得和别人一样多，他们的英雄事迹已经引起了强大的领导人的注意，并为他们赢得了在议会桌前的位置。如果你没有玩{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}，另外一群英雄袭击了Skyreach城堡，并勇敢地献出了自己的生命，使堡垒崩溃。然后，这些人物被邀请到议会，仅仅是因为他们作为强大的冒险家的声誉，以及议会期望需要他们的服务。",
	"When the characters arrive in Waterdeep, they are met by the Harper agent Leosin Erlanthar. The monk explains the purpose of the council and tells the adventurers they are expected to attend the first gathering—both so the council can thank them for their great deeds and to advise the council about the Cult of the Dragon. Four meetings of the council occur at critical points throughout the crisis, right up to the final chapter of the adventure at the Well of Dragons.": "当人物到达沃特迪普时，哈珀的代理人利奥辛-埃兰萨（Leosin Erlanthar）接待了他们。僧侣解释了议会的目的，并告诉冒险家们他们应该参加第一次聚会--这样议会就可以感谢他们的伟大功绩，并向议会提供关于龙之崇拜的建议。在整个危机的关键时刻，理事会举行了四次会议，一直到冒险的最后一章龙之井。",
	"During the {@b first session} of the council, all the Sword Coast becomes aware of how the Cult of the Dragon's plots are advancing when the {@item Draakhorn|RoT} sounds.

	"{@b second session} of the council is summoned to address increasingly aggressive dragon activity.

	"A {@b third session} of the council is called to assess the gains made by the allied factions against the Cult of the Dragon. The party is called on to pursue two leads that might grant even more advantage over the cult—a renegade cultist offering to turn over one of the dragon masks, in {@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}, and an attempt to undercut the power of the exile Red Wizards in {@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}.": "议会召开了一次{@b third session}会议，以评估联盟派别在对抗神龙教方面取得的成果。党派被要求追踪两条可能对邪教产生更大优势的线索--一个叛变的邪教分子提出交出其中一个龙面具，在{@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}，以及试图削弱流亡的红袍巫师的力量，在{@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}。",

	"Though every faction provides some troops and resources toward the final showdown with the forces of {@creature Tiamat|RoT}, the extent of their support—and how much effect that support will have—is dependent on the respect the adventurers garner from each group for their actions. Before committing irrevocably to the fight, a faction must be convinced that the cult presents a danger surpassing all other concerns—and that the adventurers are the right heroes to lead this fight. Moreover, what is worthy of respect in one faction might lose respect from another.": "尽管每个派别都为与{@creature Tiamat|RoT}势力的最后决战提供了一些部队和资源，但他们的支持程度--以及这种支持会产生多大的效果--取决于冒险者从每个团体那里获得的对其行动的尊重。在不可逆转地投入战斗之前，一个派别必须确信邪教带来的危险超过了所有其他的担忧，而且冒险者是领导这场战斗的正确英雄。此外，在一个派别中值得尊重的东西可能会失去另一个派别的尊重。",

	"Though the leadership of the Cult of the Dragon could not have realized it, one of the key events in the fight to thwart {@creature Severin|RoT}'s plans was the cult's assassination of Arthagast Ulbrinter, a Masked Lord of Waterdeep and husband of Remi Haventree of the Harpers. News of Arthagast's recent murder has spread across the Sword Coast, and has galvanized opposition to the cult in Waterdeep.": "虽然神龙教的领导层不可能意识到这一点，但在挫败{@creature Severin|RoT}计划的斗争中，关键事件之一是该教派暗杀了沃特德普的假面领主、哈珀斯人雷米-哈文特里的丈夫阿萨加斯特-乌尔布林特。Arthagast最近被谋杀的消息已经传遍了整个剑海岸，并激发了水底世界对邪教的反对。",

	"A sudden shift in the wind brings with it a strange sense of unease. The feeling is akin to the drop in air pressure before the approach of a deadly storm, or faint tremors felt from a landslide or earthquake far away. You're not the only ones who have noticed. The city around you goes unnaturally quiet suddenly. No dogs bark, no birds squawk. Even the street vendors have gone silent.": "风的突然转变带来了一种奇怪的不安感。这种感觉类似于致命风暴来临前的气压下降，或者远处山体滑坡或地震带来的微弱震荡。你们不是唯一注意到的人。你周围的城市突然变得不自然的安静。没有狗叫，没有鸟叫。甚至连街上的小贩也变得沉默了。",
	"The silence lasts only a moment before the normal sounds of Waterdeep return to mask the unexplained sensation. If the characters get to a quiet place, they notice the disturbance again, like a rumbling almost too faint to hear. As well, subtle changes in the behavior of animals can be noted. Dogs are nervous and on edge, horses are skittish, cats are more feral than usual, and rats gather in large, bold packs. Sensitive NPCs are also affected, becoming nervous, fearful, and impatient.": "寂静只持续了一会儿，然后水底世界的正常声音又回来了，掩盖了这种无法解释的感觉。如果人物到了一个安静的地方，他们又会注意到这种干扰，就像隆隆声一样，几乎微弱得听不到。同样，也可以注意到动物行为的微妙变化。狗很紧张，马很胆小，猫比平时更野性，老鼠则聚集成大群。敏感的NPC也会受到影响，变得紧张、恐惧和急躁。",
	"During the first session of the council (or earlier if the characters make efforts to investigate the strange phenomenon), the adventurers are approached by Dala Silmerhelve—a Waterdhavian noble. Read or paraphrase the following when the characters speak to Dala.": "在议会的第一次会议上（如果人物努力调查这个奇怪的现象，则更早），冒险家们被达拉-西尔梅赫夫（Dala Silmerhelve）找去了，他是一个沃特达威的贵族。当人物与达拉交谈时，请阅读或转述以下内容。",
	"\"The disturbance that's been sensed across the Sword Coast is the {@item Draakhorn|RoT}—an ancient device whose sounding alerts dragons across Faerûn that great events are unfolding. It's impossible to say what the sounding means, but the dragons hear it clearly and will eventually answer its call. \"": "\"整个剑海岸所感应到的干扰是{@item Draakhorn|RoT}--一个古老的装置，它的声音提醒整个法鲁恩的龙，伟大的事件正在展开。不可能说这声音意味着什么，但龙能清楚地听到它，并且最终会响应它的召唤。\"",
	"Lady Silmerhelve learned this from her family's secret benefactor, an ancient bronze dragon named Nymmurh. She knows a little more about the {@item Draakhorn|RoT}, but she waits to reveal it until she attends the first council meeting. She flatly refuses to tell anyone the source of her knowledge if asked. This makes Ulder Ravengard, King Conneerad, and Ontharr Frume suspicious, but others take the secrecy in stride. If Lady Silmerhelve is treated poorly, It might affect how Nymmurh interacts with the characters in {@adventure Chapter 14.|RoT|5}\"": "西尔梅赫夫夫人是从她家族的秘密恩人那里得知的，那是一条名叫尼姆赫的古老青铜龙。她还知道一点关于{@item Draakhorn|RoT}的事情，但她等到参加第一次议会会议时才透露。如果被问及，她断然拒绝告诉任何人她的知识来源。这让乌尔德-拉文加德（Ulder Ravengard）、康奈拉德国王（King Conneerad）和昂赛尔-弗鲁姆（Ontharr Frume）起了疑心，但其他人对这种保密态度也很坦然。如果Silmerhelve女士受到恶劣的对待，可能会影响Nymmurh与{@adventure Chapter 14.|RoT|5}中人物的互动。\"",
	"Having accepted the invitation to the council meeting, the adventurers are received at the Lords' Palace. Make the introduction to the City of Splendors and the Lords' Palace as detailed or as simple as fits your campaign style.": "在接受了议会会议的邀请后，冒险家们在领主府受到了接待。根据你的活动风格，对辉煌之城和领主府的介绍可以很详细，也可以很简单。",
	"Once inside the Lords' Palace, the party is escorted to the secret council chambers by Leosin Erlanthar. The outer galleries are packed with nobles engaged in heated debate, and the guards are wearing livery from city-states across the North.": "进入领主府后，一行人在利奥辛-埃兰萨的陪同下前往秘密议事厅。外面的长廊挤满了正在进行激烈辩论的贵族，卫兵们穿着来自北方各城邦的制服。",
	"Although Erlanthar is not invited to the council discussions, Remallia Haventree has informed him of the agenda and the reason the party has been summoned. He advises the characters that though the factions are all nominally committed to stopping the Cult of the Dragon, none of the delegates have made substantive pledges yet.": "虽然埃尔兰萨没有被邀请参加议会的讨论，但雷玛利亚-哈文特里（Remallia Haventree）已经告诉了他议程和聚会被召集的原因。他告诉这些人物，虽然各派别在名义上都致力于阻止神龙教，但还没有一个代表做出实质性的承诺。",
	"Too much mistrust still burdens the factions, and not enough is known about the situation. Erlanthar thinks the leaders need someone to show them the right path—heroes who will lead the forces of the Sword Coast with certainty into the coming darkness. He believes that the adventurers have a chance to be those heroes. However, he explains that each faction will weigh every word the characters say and scrutinize every one of their decisions. What pleases one group might anger another, and it will be incredibly difficult to make all parties happy.": "太多的不信任仍然困扰着各派别，而且对局势的了解也不够多。埃兰萨认为领袖们需要有人为他们指明正确的道路--那些能够带领剑海岸的军队确定地进入即将到来的黑暗的英雄。他认为冒险者们有机会成为这些英雄。然而，他解释说，每个派别都会权衡人物所说的每一句话，仔细检查他们的每一个决定。让一个团体高兴的事可能会激怒另一个团体，要让各方都满意是非常困难的。",
	"If the party played through the previous adventure, Dagult explains that the council has heard reports from Ontharr, Leosin, and other witnesses, but that the delegates wish to hear from the heroes at the center of recent events. (At this point, use Neverember to also fill in any information the characters did not gather during {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} that you deem important.)": "如果队伍经历了之前的冒险，达古特解释说议会已经听取了昂赛尔、利奥辛和其他证人的报告，但代表们希望听取处于最近事件中心的英雄们的意见。(在这一点上，请用 \"永生 \"来填补人物在{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}期间没有收集到的任何你认为重要的信息）。",
	"Most of the factions recognize that Skyreach Castle needed to be stopped, and they are happy if the castle was crashed. However, some members of the Lords' Alliance think it unconscionable that such a resource would be destroyed, intentionally or otherwise. These dissidents believe it would have been better for the characters to have waited for reinforcements, then attacked to secure the castle (regardless of how unrealistic that plan might have been).": "大多数派别都认识到，天际城堡需要被阻止，如果城堡被撞毁，他们也很高兴。然而，领主联盟的一些成员认为，不管是有意还是无意，这样的资源被摧毁是不合情理的。这些持不同意见的人认为，角色们最好先等待援军，然后再进攻以确保城堡的安全（不管这个计划可能有多么不现实）。",
	"The fate of the dragon hatchery divides opinion as well. Most delegates respect a decision to destroy the hatchery, accepting that having fewer dragons to deal with later on is an advantage. However, the Harpers would have preferred the eggs to be kept for ransoming back to their parents, potentially keeping those dragons from cooperating with the cult. Dagult would have sold the valuable eggs to \"responsible buyers,\" then used that gold to hire more mercenaries. The Emerald Enclave is firmly against any dragon eggs being destroyed, believing that the chromatic dragons are a part of the natural order and that killing their young upsets the balance of that order. Taern Hornblade and Lady Laeral Silverhand think there might have been a way to leverage the eggs as ransom, but both recognize that they would have been dangerous to hold onto—and even more dangerous to return.": "龙的孵化场的命运也存在意见分歧。大多数代表尊重摧毁孵化场的决定，认为以后少一些龙来处理是一个好处。然而，哈珀斯人更倾向于保留这些龙蛋，以便将其赎回给它们的父母，这可能会使这些龙不与邪教合作。达古特会把这些有价值的蛋卖给 \"负责任的买家\"，然后用这些黄金来雇佣更多的雇佣兵。翡翠飞地坚决反对销毁任何龙蛋，认为色龙是自然秩序的一部分，杀死它们的幼龙会破坏这种秩序的平衡。Taern Hornblade和Lady Laeral Silverhand认为可能有办法利用这些龙蛋作为赎金，但他们都认识到，持有这些龙蛋会很危险，而归还龙蛋则更危险。",
	"When the discussion around the events from {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} is concluded, the council moves on to current matters. It's obvious to all that the adventurers have taken a firm hand in addressing this crisis, and that they have proven their worth. The council deputizes the characters with emergency investigative powers and a writ demonstrating such. This grants the characters access to resources and sites they deem necessary for their investigation, but carries with it the burden of oversight from the council. If the adventurers misbehave or abuse their powers, their actions will be reviewed and the writ will be revoked.": "当围绕{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}事件的讨论结束后，议会转而讨论当前的事务。很明显，冒险家们在处理这场危机时采取了坚定的态度，他们已经证明了自己的价值。议会授予这些人物紧急调查的权力和证明这种权力的文件。这使他们有机会进入他们认为必要的资源和地点进行调查，但同时也承担了理事会的监督责任。如果冒险者行为不端或滥用他们的权力，他们的行为将被审查，令状将被撤销。",
	"Once the characters have been vested with their powers, the first stages of the adventure await.": "一旦人物被赋予了他们的力量，冒险的第一阶段就会到来。",
	"At the Second Council of Waterdeep, the adventurers see two new faces. Lord Neverember has been replaced as Open Lord of Waterdeep by Lady Laeral Silverhand, who now sits at the head of the council table. Dagult sits to her right, alongside a human female introduced as Elia (see below).": "在水底世界的第二次会议上，冒险者们看到了两张新面孔。永恒之神（Lord Neverember）已经被银手女士（Lady Laeral Silverhand）取代，成为水底世界的公开领主，她现在坐在议会桌的首位。达古特坐在她的右边，旁边还有一个被介绍为伊利亚的人类女性（见下文）。",
	"The delegates discuss the raids in their various domains after receiving the characters' report, providing flavor for the ongoing activities of the cult and giving a clear impression that the situation is escalating.": "代表们在收到人物的报告后讨论了他们各个领域的突击行动，为邪教正在进行的活动提供了味道，并给人以局势正在升级的清晰印象。",
	"In response to the fate of Wyrmspeaker {@creature Varram|RoT}, the Harpers and Taern are upset if the dwarf was slain without being interrogated, and Connerad is upset that {@creature Varram|RoT} was not captured and made an example of in a court of dwarven law. Though most are pleased with capturing {@creature Varram|RoT}, the Emerald Enclave is nonplussed, believing that capturing him only complicates matters. {@creature Varram|RoT} has already demonstrated a willingness to corrupt the natural order, making a trial excessive—and potentially opening the door to a rescue attempt.": "对于Wyrmspeaker{@creature Varram|RoT}的命运，哈珀斯和塔恩对这个矮人没有被审问就被杀死感到不满，而康纳德对{@creature Varram|RoT}没有被抓到并在矮人法庭上被当做例子感到不满。虽然大多数人对抓捕{@creature Varram|RoT}感到高兴，但翡翠飞地却不以为然，认为抓捕他只会让事情变得复杂。{@creature Varram|RoT}已经表现出了腐蚀自然秩序的意愿，使审判变得过分，并有可能为救援行动打开大门。",
	"The Arcane Brotherhood are powerful allies, and all are pleased if the party wins their allegiance—with the exception of the Order of the Gauntlet. Ontharr Frume knows that the Arcane Brotherhood does not police its members in what kinds of knowledge they pursue, and that they tolerate many evil wizards in their company. Bringing the Arcane Brotherhood into the alliance doesn't lose Frume's respect, but neither does it earn it.": "奥术兄弟会是强大的盟友，如果党派赢得了他们的效忠，所有人都会很高兴--除了高塔骑士团之外。昂赛尔-弗鲁姆知道，奥术兄弟会并不监管其成员追求什么样的知识，而且他们容忍许多邪恶的巫师与他们为伍。将奥术兄弟会带入联盟并不会失去弗鲁姆的尊重，但也不会赢得他的尊重。",
		"During the council, the adventurers are introduced to the silver dragon Otaaryliakkarnos, in her human guise as Elia. She bears an invitation from the metallic dragons to a council of their own, and the council delegates ask the adventurers to attend. This leads into {@adventure chapter 14|RoT|5}.": "在议会期间，冒险家们被介绍给银龙奥塔里亚克卡诺斯，她的人类身份是埃利亚。她带着金属龙的邀请函参加他们自己的议会，议会代表要求冒险者们参加。这导致了{@adventure chapter 14|RoT|5}。",
	"The third council features another new face—the tiefling Rian Nightshade, introduced as a special adviser to Lord Neverember. Characters who pay attention notice that some at the meeting—including Sir Isteval, Ontharr Frume, and Ambassador Brawnanvil—are doing their best to ignore the secret Zhentarim delegate, who makes no statements unless addressed by the party.": "第三次会议的主角是另一张新面孔--铁皮人里安-夜影，他被介绍为纽伦堡爵士的特别顾问。有心人注意到，会议上的一些人--包括伊斯特瓦尔爵士、昂萨-弗鲁姆和布劳南维尔大使--都在尽力忽视那个秘密的赞塔林代表，除非有当事人发言，否则他是不会发言的。",
	"News that the dragon attacks in the elven forest have ended is gratefully received by all on the council. However, King Melandrach responds with cold fury to news of his son {@creature Neronvain|RoT}'s betrayal. He remains hesitant to put elves in the front lines of combat, but no longer acts as a roadblock to negotiations. His pragmatism means that he no longer has any qualms against the adventurers' securing the allegiance of Red Wizards, giants, or even devils in the fight against the Cult of the Dragon—as long as such allies are conveniently arrayed in front of his elves in battle.": "精灵森林中的龙族攻击已经结束的消息被议会中的所有人欣然接受。然而，梅兰德斯国王对他儿子{@creature Neronvain|RoT}背叛的消息做出了冷酷的反应。他仍然对把精灵放在战斗前线犹豫不决，但不再充当谈判的路障。他的实用主义意味着他不再对冒险者在对抗龙之教的斗争中获得红袍巫师、巨人甚至魔鬼的效忠有任何顾虑，只要这些盟友在战斗中能方便地排列在他的精灵面前。",
	"All the delegates are impressed if the party has gained the support of the metallic dragons, even if their own faction was asked to make concessions. The good dragons are wise and just creatures, and their acceptance of the party greatly boosts the adventurers' standing in everyone's eyes.": "如果党获得了金属龙的支持，即使他们自己的派别被要求做出让步，所有代表都会留下深刻印象。好的龙是明智而公正的生物，他们对党的接受大大提升了冒险者在大家眼中的地位。",
	"Bartering away portions of the hoard that the cult stole is the only way some factions can make concessions. For every concession that was made for a share, circle a negative (−) icon in the following order: Dagult Neverember, Connerad, Melandrach, Lady Laeral, Ulder Ravengard, Taern Hornblade, the Harpers, Sir Isteval, and the Order of the Gauntlet. The Emerald Enclave is not affected by such concessions, since the order has not been overly affected by the dragon raids.": "用邪教偷来的囤积物的一部分进行交换，是一些派别做出让步的唯一方式。对于每一个做出让步的份额，按以下顺序圈出一个负数（-）的图标。Dagult Neverember, Connerad, Melandrach, Lady Laeral, Ulder Ravengard, Taern Hornblade, the Harpers, Sir Isteval, and the Order of the Gauntlet。翡翠飞地不受这种让步的影响，因为该骑士团没有受到龙族突袭的过度影响。",
	"As an effect of the way in which the adventurers have impressed the dragon council, it now falls to them to allocate the dragons that have pledged their service to the factions. Dragons allocated to a delegate of the Lords' Alliance are assigned to protect the capital city of the delegate's territory. A dragon assigned to the Harpers will be used for intelligence gathering. The Order of the Gauntlet sends any dragons to the city of Elturel, while the Emerald Enclave sends dragons to guard the ancient treant known as the Grandfather Tree. The party can also distribute dragons to specific regions. In such a scenario, a dragon protects a 100-mile-radius area around the point where it is assigned, stopping draconic raids in that area.": "由于冒险家们给龙会留下了深刻的印象，现在由他们来分配那些已经承诺为各派别服务的龙。分配给领主联盟代表的龙被指派保护该代表领地的首都。分配给哈珀斯的龙将被用于收集情报。高塔骑士团将任何龙派往Elturel城，而翡翠飞地则派龙守护被称为祖父树的古老树人。党派也可以将龙分配到特定区域。在这种情况下，一条龙会保护它被分配到的地点周围100英里半径的区域，阻止龙族在该区域的突袭。",
	"At the summit, information comes to the characters revealing that a senior member of the Cult of the Dragon seeks to defect from the group, and that the cultist is offering a dragon mask as part of his plea for aid. Though the offer could be a trap, the council delegates believe that the risk is worth it. The defector is holed up in a fortress known as Xonthal's Tower, recently taken over by the cult. Because a small team has a better chance to successfully infiltrate the tower than a larger force, the adventurers are asked to investigate. This leads to {@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}.": "在峰会上，这些人物得到的信息显示，神龙教的一名高级成员试图叛离该组织，而且该邪教分子提供了一个龙的面具作为他请求援助的一部分。虽然这个提议可能是一个陷阱，但议会代表们认为这个风险是值得的。叛逃者被藏在一个被称为Xonthal's Tower的堡垒里，最近被邪教组织占领了。因为小队比大队更有机会成功潜入塔内，所以冒险家们被要求进行调查。这导致了{@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}。",
	"The fourth council is the final meeting between the faction leaders and the adventurers. Hundreds of chromatic dragons have been sighted near the Well of Dragons, and the time has come to strike. At the end of this council, the delegates make their final decisions of support for the adventurers and their cause, if they haven't done so already.": "第四次会议是各派别领导人和冒险者之间的最后一次会议。在龙之井附近发现了数百条色龙，现在是出击的时候了。在这次会议结束时，如果代表们还没有做出支持冒险者和他们的事业的最后决定，他们会做出这样的决定。",
	"At an appropriate point in the council meetings, Rian Nightshade approaches the characters and asks for a private audience. She explains her position as an emissary of the Zhentarim, and of the Zhentarim's interest in current affairs. She bemoans the dithering of the other factions, stating that the Black Network is willing to act immediately and unflinchingly—if the party can help arrange agreeable terms for the Zhentarim's support.": "在理事会会议的一个适当时刻，里安-夜影走近这些人物，要求进行私人会谈。她解释了她作为Zhentarim使者的身份，以及Zhentarim对当前事务的兴趣。她哀叹其他派别的犹豫不决，并表示黑网愿意立即毫不犹豫地采取行动--如果该党能够帮助安排赞塔林支持的合意条款。",
	"Rian points out that the Zhentarim have a keen interest in Xonthal's Tower. Ownership of the tower is under discussion by the council, but the tiefling wants to deal directly with the adventurers, who have claim to the tower by right of conquest. The Zhentarim are willing to purchase the adventurers' interest in the tower for 50,000 gold pieces, and Rian can throw in a {@item Potion of Greater Healing|| greater healing potion}, a {@item potion of frost giant strength}, and a {@item spell scroll} of {@spell earthquake} to sweeten the deal. This price could go up considerably if the party negotiates agreeable terms from the other factions for the Zhentarim's support—up to an additional 25,000 gp, at your discretion.": "里安指出，Zhentarim对Xonthal的塔有浓厚的兴趣。议会正在讨论该塔的所有权，但铁皮人想直接与冒险者打交道，因为他们有征服权，对该塔有要求。镇塔人愿意以50,000金币的价格购买冒险者在塔中的权益，而且里安可以在{@item Potion of Greater Healing|| greater healing potion}、{@item potion of frost giant strength}和{@item spell scroll}的{@spell earthquake}中加入甜头。如果党派从其他派别那里谈判出同意的条款，以获得Zhentarim的支持，这个价格可能会大幅上升--最多可额外增加25000金币，由你决定。",
	"Any alliance with the Red Wizards is a mixed blessing. More pragmatic factions and delegates—including the Harpers, King Melandrach, Dagult Neverember, and Taern Hornblade—are impressed by the diplomacy such an arrangement demonstrates, and know that regardless of the Red Wizards' character and previous plots against the Sword Coast, they are a significant asset. Sir Isteval, Ambassador Brawnanvil, and the Order of the Gauntlet object to the idea of even opening dialogue with the Red Wizards, and believe that the Thayans would agree to an alliance only if it furthered their own plots to rule the Sword Coast and all Faerûn. Lady Laeral and Ulder Ravengard both think the Red Wizards unpredictable but necessary, believing that the only important factor is how the Thayans influence the outcome of the final battle.": "任何与红袍巫师的联盟都是喜忧参半的。更加务实的派别和代表--包括哈珀人、梅兰德斯国王、达古特-纽伦堡和泰恩-霍恩布拉德--对这种安排所展现的外交手段印象深刻，并知道无论红袍巫师的性格和之前对剑海岸的阴谋如何，他们都是一笔重要的资产。Isteval爵士、Brawnanvil大使和Gauntlet骑士团反对与红袍巫师展开对话的想法，并认为只有在促进他们自己统治剑海岸和整个Faerûn的阴谋的情况下，Thayans才会同意建立联盟。拉伊尔夫人和乌尔德-拉文加德都认为红袍巫师是不可预测的，但也是必要的，他们认为唯一重要的因素是塔扬人如何影响最后的战斗结果。",
	"The outcome of the support of the metallic dragons (as allocated in the third council) is accounted for in this fourth council. Factions that did not receive draconic aid suffer terribly in the cult's raids, and some delegates resent the adventurers for withholding the service of their dragon allies. Only Isteval, Connerad, and the Harpers maintain their respect for the adventurers regardless of how the dragons were assigned. Cormyr remains largely untouched by the cult, whose operations remain focused on the Sword Coast. The Harpers have no strongholds, and so suffer less than other factions. Ambassador Brawnanvil appreciates the value of dragon guards, but his strongholds are deep underground and hard for the cult to reach—and all dwarves know how even good dragons covet dwarven gems and gold.": "金属龙支持的结果（如在第三次议会中的分配）在这第四次议会中得到了说明。没有得到龙族援助的派别在邪教的袭击中遭受了极大的伤害，一些代表对冒险者扣留龙族盟友的服务感到不满。只有伊斯特瓦尔（Isteval）、康纳德（Connerad）和哈珀斯（Harpers）对冒险者保持尊重，不管龙是如何被分配的。科米尔在很大程度上没有受到邪教的影响，他们的行动仍然集中在剑海岸。哈珀人没有据点，所以比其他派别受到的影响要小。布劳南威尔大使很欣赏龙族守卫的价值，但他的据点深入地下，邪教很难到达--所有矮人都知道即使是好龙也会觊觎矮人的宝石和黄金。",
	"Every faction will donate troops and resources to the struggle against the Cult of the Dragon. However, to win the battle requires the full, unconditional support of multiple factions. The outcome of the Council of Waterdeep is tracked on the {@b Council Scorecard} ({@adventure appendix B|RoT|10}), which determines what resources are available to oppose the Cult of the Dragon during the final confrontation at the Well of Dragons.": "每个派别都会为反对神龙教的斗争捐献军队和资源。然而，要赢得这场战斗，需要多个派别无条件的全力支持。沃特德普议会的结果在{@b Council Scorecard}({@adventure appendix B|RoT|10})上被追踪，这决定了在龙之井的最后对抗中，有哪些资源可以用来反对龙之教。",
	"Which way a faction leans is determined by the adventurers' actions and accomplishments during the adventure. Successfully completing an chapter of the adventure will usually gain support from multiple factions. However, each faction has its own priorities, and sometimes a heroic deed that pleases one faction can anger or disappoint another. In some cases, a faction might even prefer that the characters engage in antiheroic acts—by executing certain enemies rather than taking prisoners, for example. The adventurers might also be seen to be favoring certain factions, if metallic dragon allies are sent to defend the interests and settlements of one faction over another.": "一个派别倾向于哪个方向是由冒险者在冒险过程中的行动和成就决定的。成功完成冒险的某一章节通常会获得多个派系的支持。然而，每个派别都有自己的优先权，有时一个英雄的行为如果让一个派别高兴，就会让另一个派别感到愤怒或失望。在某些情况下，一个派别甚至可能希望人物从事反英雄的行为--例如，处决某些敌人而不是俘虏。如果金属龙的盟友被派去捍卫一个派别的利益和定居点，而不是另一个派别，那么冒险者也可能被视为偏袒某些派别。",
	"Each faction has its own column on the scorecard. Important events that occur during {@i The Rise of Tiamat} are noted along the side of the scorecard, beginning with events that could have occurred in the previous adventure, {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}. If you didn't play {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}, assume that events marked with an asterisk (*) occurred and that other events did not.": "每个派别在记分卡上都有自己的栏目。在{@i The Rise of Tiamat}期间发生的重要事件会沿着记分卡的侧面注明，从可能发生在前一次冒险中的事件开始，{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}。如果你没有玩过{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}，请假设标有星号(*)的事件已经发生，而其他事件没有发生。",
	"A plus sign (+) for a particular faction and event indicates that the faction approves of the successful outcome of that event, and that the characters gain respect for that outcome. Each + counts as +1 in the final tally. A negative icon (−) indicates that a faction disapproves of an outcome and the characters lose respect for it. Each−counts as −1 in the final tally. A blank means that the faction either doesn't consider the event significant or that there's no consensus within the faction. Some events are especially important to certain factions, and are marked double plus (+/+) or double minus (−/−). They count as +2 or −2, respectively, in the tally.": "某一派别和事件的加号（+）表示该派别认可该事件的成功结果，并且人物因该结果而获得尊重。每一个 \"+\"都算作最终统计中的+1。负的图标（-）表示一个派别不赞成某个结果，人物会因此失去尊重。每个-在最后的统计中算作-1。空白表示该派别要么认为该事件不重要，要么派别内部没有达成共识。有些事件对某些派别特别重要，并被标记为双加（+/+）或双减（-/-）。它们在统计中分别算作+2或-2。",
	"Whenever an event occurs as noted in the list, circle or highlight the appropriate icons. You can usually mark all the icons in a row at once.

	"Three rows on the table have icons that can't be marked all at once. These are the decisions about which factions receive metallic dragon guardians, which factions had to make concessions to secure the metallic dragons' aid, and who takes possession of Xonthal's Tower. Only the factions that are affected have their icons marked. For example, if King Melandrach and Ulder Ravengard had to make concessions to win the support of the metallic dragons, only their entries on that line should be circled or highlighted.": "桌子上有三行图标不能同时标记。这些是关于哪些派别获得金属龙守护者的决定，哪些派别不得不做出让步以确保金属龙的援助，以及谁拥有Xonthal的塔。只有受到影响的派别才会有他们的图标标记。例如，如果Melandrach国王和Ulder Ravengard不得不做出让步以赢得金属龙的支持，那么只有他们在该行的条目应该被圈起来或突出显示。",
	"Some attendees are easier to sway toward pledging their full support, including Dagult Neverember. Others are more difficult, such as Connerad Brawnanvil. Additionally, securing Sir Isteval or Laeral Silverhand's full support provides one additional respect for certain of the other factions, since both those senior delegates hold great influence on the council.": "有些与会者比较容易动摇，包括达古特-纽伦堡（Dagult Neverember），以保证他们的全面支持。其他人则比较困难，比如康纳德-布劳南威尔。此外，确保伊斯特瓦尔爵士或拉拉尔-银手的全力支持为其他某些派别提供了额外的尊重，因为这两位高级代表在议会中拥有巨大的影响力。",
	"The scorecard covers the events and outcomes that are likely to occur over the course of the adventure. However, {@i The Rise of Tiamat} is an open-ended scenario, such that decisions by the players might trigger events that aren't noted on the scorecard.

	"At the end of each council, add up all the plusses and minuses from that stage of the adventure and write the subtotal in the provided space. At the end of the fourth council, add up the subtotals.

	"Far to the north, beyond the Spine of the World and above even Icewind Dale, lies the Sea of Moving Ice. Gigantic icebergs wander listlessly through this glasslike sea, or are sent smashing and grinding against each other by bitterly cold winds, the sea spray transformed into fantastic frozen shapes around them. Only creatures adapted to severe cold can survive such frigid extremes, but many beasts—and even people—make their homes in the Sea of Moving Ice. One such creature is the white dragon Arauthator, known as \"Old White Death\" by those he stalks and terrorizes. In this section of the adventure, the heroes' battle against the cult leads them to one of Arauthator's iceberg lairs.": "在遥远的北方，在世界之脊之外，甚至在冰风谷之上，是移动的冰海。巨大的冰山无精打采地在这片玻璃般的海洋中游荡，或者被严寒的风吹得粉碎，相互摩擦，海浪在它们周围变成了奇妙的冰冻形状。只有适应严寒的生物才能在如此寒冷的极端环境中生存，但许多野兽，甚至人类都在移动的冰海中安家。白龙Arauthator就是这样一种生物，他被那些被他跟踪和恐吓的人称为 \"老白死\"。在冒险的这一部分中，英雄们与邪教的战斗将他们带到了阿劳特的一个冰山巢穴中。",
	"The white dragon Arauthator haunts the Sea of Moving Ice like an avenging wind.

	"Arauthator's chief lair is beneath a remote peak known as Lonefang Mountain, but he maintains a number of smaller lairs among the icebergs that drift with the seasonal tides in the Sea of Moving Ice. One of these is known as Oyaviggaton (\"island of eternity\") by the local tribes known as the Ice Hunters, because of the many enemies Arauthator has frozen into the icy walls of the berg's hollowed interior.": "Arauthator的主要巢穴在一个被称为Lonefang Mountain的偏远山峰下，但他在随季节性潮汐漂移的移动冰海的冰山中保持着许多较小的巢穴。其中一个被称为 \"猎冰人 \"的当地部落称为 \"奥亚维加顿\"（\"永恒之岛\"），因为阿劳特将许多敌人冻结在冰山内部的冰墙上。",
	"In addition to his size, cunning, and ferocity, Arauthator wields spellcasting power that makes him a particularly dangerous foe. More than a century ago, during one of the cyclical periods of draconic violence known as the Rage of Dragons, Arauthator joined with a dozen other dragons in attacking the Hosttower of the Arcane in Luskan. Their assault toppled the west arm of the tower, and Arauthator was seen scooping up numerous items of great magical importance and power, including at least three tomes of rare spells. The possibility of recovering those books is part of what drew {@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT} to the Sea of Moving Ice.": "除了他的体型、狡猾和凶猛之外，Arauthator还拥有法术能力，这使他成为一个特别危险的敌人。一个多世纪以前，在被称为 \"龙之怒 \"的龙族暴力周期中，Arauthator与其他十几条龙一起袭击了卢斯坎的奥术主机塔。他们的攻击推翻了塔的西臂，人们看到Arauthator捡起了许多具有巨大魔法重要性和力量的物品，包括至少三本稀有的法术书。恢复这些书籍的可能性是吸引{@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT}来到移动冰海的部分原因。",

Some carry tools and useful items in pouches slung around their necks.": "当人物遇到冰蟾蜍时，他们的智力不会被发现，直到他们采取行动或试图说话。即使如此，角色们也未必能认出冰蟾的呱呱叫声是语言。冰蟾以四肢移动，但它们有蹼的前脚却出奇的灵巧。有些冰蟾将工具和有用的物品放在脖子上的袋子里。",
	"With its caverns carved out of the glacial depths of the iceberg, every surface in Oyaviggaton is made of ice.": "由于其洞穴是在冰山的冰川深处开凿出来的，奥亚维加顿的每一个表面都是由冰构成的。",
	"Most passages in the ice caves are at least 15 feet wide, and ceilings are 20 feet high unless noted otherwise. The walls are intricately carved with draconic imagery, pillars, cornices, filigrees, buttresses, leering dragon faces, and other decorative flourishes. This work has been done by kobolds in Arauthator's service, and its quality varies widely.": "冰洞里的大多数通道至少有15英尺宽，天花板有20英尺高，除非另有说明。墙壁上错综复杂地雕刻着龙族的形象、柱子、檐口、花纹、拱门、倾斜的龙脸以及其他装饰性的图案。这些工作都是由为Arauthator服务的哥布林完成的，其质量差别很大。",
	"The interior of Oyaviggaton is filled with dim light by whale-oil lamps that are kept filled and lit by the kobolds. The light is for the benefit of the ice toads, who are the only residents of the caves who need light to see.": "奥亚维加顿的内部充满了鲸油灯的昏暗光线，这些灯由哥布林保持填充和照明。这些灯光是为了冰蟾蜍的利益，它们是洞穴中唯一需要灯光才能看到的居民。",
	"The ice caves are open to the sea, creating banks of vapor that roll constantly through Oyaviggaton's corridors and chambers. This fog is more common in the low points of the caverns. In areas noted as +10 feet on the map, visibility is unrestricted unless a patch of random fog is encountered. In areas noted as 0 feet, visibility is limited to 75 feet. In areas noted as–10 feet or–20 feet, visibility is limited to 45 feet.": "冰洞向大海开放，形成了水汽的银行，在奥亚维加顿的走廊和房间里不断滚动。这种雾气在岩洞的低洼处更为常见。在地图上标有+10英尺的区域，能见度是不受限制的，除非遇到一片随机的雾气。在标注为0英尺的区域，能见度被限制在75英尺。在标注为10英尺或20英尺的区域，能见度被限制在45英尺以内。",

	"Arauthator brought a pack of unwitting kobolds to Oyaviggaton generations ago, and the creatures have been serving him in the frigid cold ever since. In the event of an encounter, a squad of {@dice 3d6} {@creature Kobold||kobolds} is working in or passing through the area. If the characters are dressed as Ice Hunter villagers or are wearing some other appropriate disguise, the kobolds eye them warily but don't immediately sound an alarm. Make a single Wisdom check for the kobolds with a DC equal to the lowest of the characters' checks to disguise themselves. The kobolds' Wisdom modifier is–2, but they have advantage on this check because of their numbers. If the check is successful (or if the characters aren't disguised), the kobolds launch a single volley of sling stones at the intruders, then flee in as many directions as possible to report the intrusion to the ice toads or ice trolls.": "Arauthator在几代人之前将一群不知情的哥布林带到了奥亚维加顿，从那时起，这些生物一直在寒冷的环境中为他服务。在遇到这种情况时，有一队{@dice 3d6}{@creature Kobold||kobolds}的人在该地区工作或经过。如果这些人物打扮成猎冰人村民或穿着其他适当的伪装，哥布林会警惕地看着他们，但不会立即发出警报。对哥布林进行一次智慧检查，检查的DC等于角色的伪装检查中最低的一次。哥布林的智慧修正值是2，但是由于他们的数量，他们在这次检查中具有优势。如果检定成功（或者如果角色没有伪装），哥布林会向入侵者发射一排吊石，然后尽可能地朝多个方向逃离，向冰蟾或冰巨魔报告这次入侵。",

The ice toads flee to the ice trolls if threatened, fighting only if they must.": "有一队{@dice 1d6}{@creature Ice Toad|RoT|ice toads}(见{@adventure appendix D|RoT|12})的人正在这个区域工作或沿着走廊经过。伪装对冰蟾蜍是无效的，它们知道在任何时候在奥亚维加顿生活着什么生物。如果它们看到任何意外的情况--甚至是猎冰人村民未经许可进入洞穴--它们就会停下手中的工作，观察人物的行动，如果可以的话，就会问问题。如果受到威胁，冰蟾蜍会逃到冰巨魔那里，只有在必要时才会战斗。",
	"The ice toads speak their own language, plus enough Draconic and Uluik to communicate with Arauthator, the kobolds, and the Ice Hunters. They work for Arauthator but have no special devotion to the dragon. If a fight is coming, their loyalty goes to whomever they expect to win. That means the dragon, unless the characters somehow impress them.": "冰蟾蜍会说他们自己的语言，还有足够的Draconic和Uluik语言，可以和Arauthator、哥布林以及冰雪猎人交流。他们为阿劳特工作，但对龙没有特别的奉献精神。如果一场战斗即将来临，他们的忠诚度将归于他们所期望的胜利者。这意味着龙，除非这些角色以某种方式打动他们。",

	"Inside the hut of the shaman Bonecarver, old furs heaped atop poles are laid across an opening leading down to the ice caves. Steps are cut into the wall of the chute, creating steep, icy stairs that drop down 100 feet in a tight spiral. Because this entrance is seldom used, the steps become increasingly obscured by frost as the characters descend. At the 40-foot mark, a character must attempt a DC 12 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check to maintain a grip on the dangerously uneven footholds. Failure means the character loses his or her footing, sliding and tumbling 60 feet to the bottom and taking 21 ({@dice 6d6}) bludgeoning damage. Characters can mitigate this danger by roping themselves together or using a climber's kit. Past the 40-foot mark, the steps improve again so that no further checks are necessary.": "在萨满Bonecarver的小屋里，堆在柱子上的旧毛皮被铺在通往冰洞的开口上。在滑道的墙壁上凿出了台阶，形成了陡峭的冰台阶，以紧密的螺旋形下降了100英尺。由于这个入口很少被使用，随着人物的下降，台阶越来越被冰霜所遮挡。在40英尺的地方，角色必须尝试用DC12灵巧({@skill Acrobatics})检查来保持对危险的不平坦的立足点的抓握。失败意味着角色失去了他或她的立足点，滑行和翻滚60英尺到底部，并受到21({@dice 6d6})的重击伤害。角色可以通过把自己绑在一起或使用攀爬者装备来减轻这种危险。过了40英尺，台阶会再次改善，因此不需要进一步检查。",
	"The chute and its icy stairs end at the ceiling. A sturdy ladder then descends into the approximate center of a rectangular chamber. The exit to the corridor is an icy, 15-foot-wide passageway sloping downward.": "滑道和其冰冷的楼梯在天花板上结束。然后，一个结实的梯子下降到一个长方形房间的大约中心。通往走廊的出口是一条冰冷的、15英尺宽的通道，向下方倾斜。",
	"The chamber is empty except for a dozen baskets woven from leather strips and walrus ribs, stacked in the north corner. These contain frozen fish and a few skin-wrapped bundles of rotting shark meat that the Ice Hunters consider a delicacy.": "这个房间是空的，只有北边角落里堆放着一打用皮条和海象肋骨编织的篮子。这些篮子里有冰冻的鱼和几捆包着皮的腐烂鲨鱼肉，冰雪猎人认为这是一道美味。",
	"Hidden beneath the planks in the back corner of the village hall, this entrance to the ice caves consists of a chute carved with icy stairs descending 100 feet in a tight spiral. This route is used regularly to bring supplies to Arauthator's minions, so the steps are clear and easy to climb. Supplies are carried down strapped to villagers' backs, or lowered in baskets with the pulley and rope in the village hall.": "这个冰洞的入口隐藏在村子大厅后角的木板下，由一个刻有冰梯的滑道组成，以紧密的螺旋方式下降100英尺。这条路线经常被用来给阿劳特的爪牙运送物资，所以台阶很清晰，很容易攀爬。补给品被绑在村民的背上背下来，或者用村委会的滑轮和绳子放在篮子里放下来。",
	"This chamber is empty except for three bundles of rolled-up sealskins sitting where the ladder descends from the chute above to the approximate center of the room. Additionally, a bed of piled furs has been arranged in the southwest corner, from which the sound of loud coughing can be heard when the characters enter the chamber.

The coughing villager is named {@creature Mend-nets|RoT} ({@creature tribal warrior}).": "这个房间是空的，只有三捆卷起来的海豹皮坐在梯子上，从上面的滑道下降到房间的大约中心。此外，西南角还摆放着一张堆放毛皮的床，当人物进入房间时，可以从那里听到大声的咳嗽声。患有疾病或受伤的村民，如果超过了博纳弗有限的治疗能力，就会被隔离在这里，在相对温暖的山洞里。咳嗽的村民被命名为{@creature Mend-nets|RoT}({@creature tribal warrior})。",
	"The supplies that the villagers provide for Arauthator and his minions are stored here—mostly dried and frozen fish, whale, seal, walrus, and giant squid, plus furs that the kobolds fashion into protective clothing. Fish organs, shells, bones, soft stone, and other sundries are stored in smaller quantities, and are used by the ice toads to make ink, brushes, parchment, and other items for their work. A few seemingly inexplicable items are stored away from the other supplies, including a single steel gauntlet, a silver brooch containing a cameo, the brass hilt of a dueling knife, and a decorative belt buckle—bits and pieces that the villagers have pulled from the stomachs of sharks or giant octopi that have fed on explorers lost to the Sea of Moving Ice.": "村民们为Arauthator和他的爪牙提供的物资都存放在这里--主要是干燥和冷冻的鱼、鲸鱼、海豹、海象和巨型鱿鱼，还有哥布林们用来制作防护服的毛皮。鱼的器官、贝壳、骨头、软石和其他杂物的储存量较小，被冰蟾用来制作墨水、画笔、羊皮纸和其他工作物品。一些看起来莫名其妙的物品被存放在远离其他用品的地方，包括一个钢铠，一个含有浮雕的银色胸针，一把决斗刀的铜柄，以及一个装饰性的皮带扣--这些都是村民们从鲨鱼或巨型章鱼的肚子里掏出来的碎片，这些鲨鱼或章鱼曾以迷失在移动冰海的探险者为食。",
	"Also stockpiled in this chamber are coils of rope, spikes, and a few pulleys. It's clear at a glance that this gear has come from the south and was not made by the Ice Hunters. The kobolds use this equipment when something—or someone—needs to be lowered down into Arauthator's lair through area 6. The pulley is attached to the iron hook in the ceiling of that chamber.": "在这个密室里还堆放着一圈圈的绳子、钉子和一些滑轮。一看就知道，这些装备来自南方，不是猎冰人制造的。当一些东西--或者一些人--需要通过6号区域被放下去进入阿劳特的巢穴时，哥布林们就会使用这个装备。滑轮连接在那个房间天花板上的铁钩上。",
	"Arauthator's kobold servants live in this chamber.": "Arauthator的哥布林仆人住在这个房间里。",
	"A dozen kobolds occupy this disheveled and filthy chamber. Half-eaten fish heads and gnawed seal flippers are tossed into corners or carelessly strewn around matted heaps of furs, which would undoubtedly smell as bad as they look if not for the cold.": "十几个哥布林占据了这个凌乱而肮脏的房间。吃了一半的鱼头和被咬碎的海豹鳍被扔在角落里，或者不经意地散落在垫高的毛皮堆周围，如果不是因为寒冷，这些毛皮无疑会像它们看起来一样难闻。",

	"The kobolds throw their litter, food scraps, waste, worn-out boots, and other useless junk into this cavernous chamber. Its pit-like floor is filled to a depth of several feet, courtesy of minions that have been serving Arauthator in this iceberg for centuries. The trash floor of the chamber can be safely traversed, but there is nothing of value here.": "哥布林们把他们的垃圾、食物残渣、废物、破旧的靴子和其他无用的垃圾扔进这个空洞的房间。它的坑状地板被填到几英尺深，这是几个世纪以来一直在这个冰山中为阿劳特服务的奴才们的功劳。密室的垃圾地板可以安全穿越，但这里没有任何有价值的东西。",

	"This chamber feels far colder than any area of the ice caves you've explored so far. The cold issues from a yawning pit in the floor that twists down into darkness, and above which a heavy iron hook is anchored in the ice of the ceiling. A five-foot-wide walkway extends around both sides of the pit, connecting this entrance to an exit across the room. Carved into the ice of the walls are images of white dragons in flight.": "这个密室感觉比你迄今为止探索过的任何冰洞区域都要冷得多。寒冷来自于地板上的一个大坑，这个大坑一直延伸到黑暗中，上面有一个沉重的铁钩被固定在天花板的冰层上。一条五英尺宽的走道围绕着坑的两边延伸，将这个入口与房间对面的一个出口连接起来。墙壁的冰面上刻有白龙飞翔的图像。",
	"A visual inspection from either doorway indicates that the walkway looks safe enough—aside from being icy, narrow, and adjacent to an apparently bottomless pit. The walkway that crosses the east and north sides of the chamber is, in fact, safe, and characters can walk along it without difficulty. The walkway that crosses the west and south walls is weakened and dangerous. When a character reaches the bend in the walkway, have the player roll any die. If an odd number is rolled, a portion of the wall crumbles, and any creature on the walkway must attempt a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed off the walkway into the chute.": "从任何一个门口进行目测，都会发现走道看起来足够安全--除了冰冷、狭窄和毗邻一个明显的无底洞之外。事实上，穿过密室东侧和北侧的走道是安全的，人物可以毫无困难地沿着它行走。穿过西面和南面墙壁的走道被削弱了，很危险。当一个角色走到走道的拐弯处时，让玩家掷出任何一个骰子。如果掷出的数字是奇数，墙的一部分就会崩塌，走道上的任何生物都必须尝试DC17的灵巧救赎动作。如果救赎失败，该生物将被推下走道进入滑道。",
	"The chute drops 60 feet to the top of the ice platform in {@area area 16 |0d0|x} in Arauthator's lair. A creature tipped into the chute slides as much as falls, taking only 10 ({@dice 3d6}) bludgeoning damage when hitting bottom. The creature must then attempt a Dexterity saving throw or fall off the ice platform; see area 16 for more information.

	"The bodies of some of the frost giants Arauthator has fought and killed over the centuries are on display in this chamber, frozen into crystal-clear ice walls. Visibility at this level is only 45 feet, so characters won't be able to see much from the doorway. As they move into the chamber, the shape of the first frost giant becomes dimly visible at a distance of 60 feet. At 45 feet, the figure is easily mistakable for a living frost giant standing perfectly still. At 30 feet, the characters recognize that the giant is dead and frozen, seeing its torn armor and the awful claw wounds in its pale blue flesh. The hall displays the bodies of eight frost giants, one fire giant, and one cloud giant.": "几个世纪以来，阿罗伊特与冰霜巨人战斗并杀死的一些人的尸体就陈列在这个房间里，被冻成了水晶般透明的冰墙。这一层的能见度只有45英尺，所以人物从门口看不太清楚。当他们进入密室时，第一个冰霜巨人的形状在60英尺的距离上变得模糊可见。在45英尺处，这个身影很容易被误认为是一个完全静止的活体冰霜巨人。在30英尺处，人物可以认出这个巨人已经死了，而且被冻住了，看到它被撕裂的盔甲和它淡蓝色肉体上可怕的爪子伤口。大厅里陈列着八个冰霜巨人、一个火巨人和一个云巨人的尸体。",
	"Trophies of Arauthator's many battles are displayed in this chamber. Visibility is 45 feet, so the characters won't be able to see much from the doorway. Among the creatures frozen here in death are two remorhazes, a trio of behirs, five abominable yetis, and a giant squid of jaw-dropping size. A complete longship with sail raised is also on display here. The ship clearly will not fit through any of the iceberg's entrances; it was painstakingly disassembled outside and reassembled here by the kobolds. Characters who know ships can see mistakes in the rigging and hull planking, but it's passably good work for a display.": "Arauthator多次战斗的战利品就陈列在这个房间里。能见度为45英尺，所以人物从门口看不出什么来。在这里被冻死的生物中，有两只雷莫哈兹（remorhazes），三只贝赫（behirs），五只可恶的雪人，以及一只大得令人瞠目结舌的巨大乌贼。这里还展示了一艘完整的长船，船帆已经升起。这艘船显然无法通过冰山的任何一个入口；它是由哥布林们在外面煞费苦心地拆卸并在这里重新组装的。了解船只的人可以看到索具和船身木板上的错误，但对于展示来说，这还算不错的作品。",
	"Of more immediate interest is the open chest of gold and jewels sitting on the ship's deck. The chest contains 375 gp, 1,480 ep, and 495 sp, plus jewelry and precious objects worth another 225 gp.

	"When the characters step inside, read or paraphrase the following.": "当人物走进去的时候，阅读或转述以下内容。",
	"The interior of the shelter is surprisingly warm, thanks to a small stove and simple lamps burning aromatic whale oil. Carpets are heaped on the floor in thick layers, and tapestries from every culture in Faerûn hang suspended from a sturdy frame of whale ribs.": "由于有一个小炉子和燃烧着芳香鲸油的简单灯具，庇护所的内部出奇地温暖。地板上铺着厚厚的地毯，来自法鲁恩各种文化的挂毯悬挂在鲸鱼肋骨的坚固框架上。",
	"Books and scrolls are stacked neatly on tables and reading stands made of hide and whalebone. The only furnishings in the shelter not made from these natural materials are the carpets and tapestries, and a portable writing desk that appears to have been taken from a sailing ship.": "书籍和卷轴整齐地堆放在用兽皮和鲸骨制成的桌子和阅读架上。庇护所中唯一不是由这些天然材料制成的家具是地毯和挂毯，以及一张似乎是从帆船上拆下来的便携式写字台。",

	"Seated at the writing desk is a female tiefling wearing a blazing crimson cloak over tailored furs. The cloak is fastened with a silver-and-ivory brooch bearing a design reminiscent of a stylized, branching tree—the symbol of the Arcane Brotherhood. Two kobold attendants stand nearby, glancing nervously between you and the tiefling. After a few moments, the tiefling looks up with an expression of pale disinterest and asks, \"Have you come to save me or kill me? Not that there will be much difference between the two.\"": "坐在写字台前的是一个女铁皮人，穿着一件深红色的斗篷，外面套着合身的皮草。斗篷上系着一枚银色和象牙色的胸针，上面的图案让人联想到一棵风格化的树，这是奥术兄弟会的象征。两个哥布林随从站在附近，紧张地在你和铁弗林之间扫视。过了一会儿，铁皮人抬起头来，露出苍白无力的表情，问道：\"你们是来救我还是来杀我？这两者之间并没有什么区别。\"",
	"When Maccath arrived at Oyaviggaton three years ago, Arauthator would normally have killed her without a second thought. However, the brooch of the Arcane Brotherhood she wore suggested to Arauthator that the tiefling might present a solution to two problems. First, the dragon possessed numerous items stolen from the Arcane Brotherhood, some of which defied his understanding even after decades of study. Second, Arauthator had long sought to help his mate Arveiaturace overcome her grief over the death of the wizard she once served. Replacing that wizard with a member of the Arcane Brotherhood seemed a perfect solution.": "三年前，当马卡斯来到奥亚维加顿时，Arauthator通常会不假思索地杀死她。然而，她佩戴的奥术兄弟会的胸针向Arauthator建议，这个铁皮人可能是两个问题的解决方案。首先，这条龙拥有许多从奥术兄弟会那里偷来的物品，其中一些物品即使经过几十年的研究也让他无法理解。第二，Arauthator长期以来一直试图帮助他的伴侣Arveiaturace克服她对她曾经服务的巫师的死亡的悲痛。用一个奥术兄弟会的成员取代那个巫师似乎是一个完美的解决方案。",
	"Though she is a prisoner, Maccath has become obsessed with completing Arauthator's challenging magical translations. Like most members of the Arcane Brotherhood, she is dedicated to the point of arrogance, believing that even if she is fated to die as a dragon's plaything, she will have accomplished something magnificent first.": "虽然她是个囚犯，但马卡思已经迷上了完成Arauthator的挑战性魔法翻译。像大多数奥术兄弟会成员一样，她专注到了傲慢的地步，认为即使她注定要作为龙的玩物死去，她也会先完成一些宏伟的任务。",
	"As such, the tiefling sets out terms for her rescue, saying that she won't leave Oyaviggaton without bringing along as much of the Arcane Brotherhood's stolen property as she can. If the characters agree, Maccath shares the following information:": "因此，铁皮人提出了营救她的条件，说她如果不把奥术兄弟会偷来的财产尽可能多地带上，就不会离开奥亚维加顿。如果人物同意，麦卡思会分享以下信息。",
	"Arauthator is currently in{@area  area 20|0d5|x} of his lair, close to the entrance beneath the scriptorium (area 11).": "Arauthator目前在{@area  area 20|0d5|x}他的巢穴里，靠近剧本馆下面的入口（11区）。",
	"Maccath knows the general layout of the dragon's cavern but not its specific dangers. Arauthator has never allowed her out of his sight in the lair. In particular, she knows nothing of the scrags in {@area area 15|0cf|x} or the traps in {@area area 18|0d2|x}.": "马卡思知道龙穴的大致布局，但不知道它的具体危险。Arauthator在巢穴中从未让她离开过他的视线。特别是，她对{@area area 15|0cf|x}的碎石和{@area area 18|0d2|x}的陷阱一无所知。",

	"The {@item Draakhorn|RoT} was here when Maccath came to Oyaviggaton, but a group of humans wearing distinctive robes came to the iceberg half a year ago.

In addition to this, Maccath can tell the characters all the information about the {@item Draakhorn|RoT} as it's described in {@adventure chapter 17|RoT|8}.": "当马卡斯来到奥亚维加顿时，这个{@item Draakhorn|RoT}就在这里，但半年前一群穿着独特长袍的人类来到了冰山。在与Arauthator交涉后，他们带走了这个装置。(在马卡思对这些人类的描述中，人物认出了神龙教的服饰)。除此之外，马卡思还能告诉人物关于{@item Draakhorn|RoT}的所有信息，因为它在{@adventure chapter 17|RoT|8}中被描述。",
	"Trying to escape from the iceberg on a ship would be suicidal while Arauthator is able to attack from the air. The dragon is content to let his minions deal with intruders, but he will be alerted if the characters flee.": "试图乘船逃离冰山将是自杀行为，而Arauthator能够从空中攻击。这条龙满足于让他的爪牙来对付入侵者，但如果人物逃跑，他就会被惊动。",

	"Maccath knows that surprise is the characters' best weapon for challenging the dragon, and that he will not risk dying over this single lair. Though he hates the idea of abandoning a home with its treasure and trophies, if bested by the adventurers, Arauthator will flee to one of his other lairs.": "马卡斯知道，出其不意是角色们挑战巨龙的最好武器，他不会为这个单一的巢穴冒死。虽然他讨厌放弃有财宝和战利品的家，但如果被冒险家们打败，阿罗伊特会逃到他的其他巢穴。",
	"If the party seems intent on fighting Arauthator, Maccath offers them a {@item Ring of Cold Resistance||ring of resistance (cold)} and two {@item Arrow of Slaying||arrows of slaying (dragons)} that she has crafted during her captivity. Though these items and her draconic knowledge give the characters an edge, she warns the party that Arauthator has devoured almost every hero he has faced.": "如果队伍似乎有意与阿劳特战斗，麦卡思会给他们一个{@item Ring of Cold Resistance||ring of resistance (cold)}和两个{@item Arrow of Slaying||arrows of slaying (dragons)}她在囚禁期间制作的东西。虽然这些物品和她的龙族知识给角色带来了优势，但她警告大家，阿劳特几乎吞噬了他所面对的所有英雄。",
	"Though this chamber is deeper than the adjacent caverns, no mist hangs in the air here.": "虽然这个密室比邻近的洞穴更深，但这里的空气中没有雾气缭绕。",
	"Three shelves stand in this otherwise empty cavern, cobbled together out of salvaged wood, whale bone, pieces of giants' armor, and even the frozen limbs of yetis. A number of scrolls, books, parchments, and folios are carefully arranged on the shelves, all bearing the markings of magical writing.": "在这个空荡荡的洞穴里，有三个书架，是用打捞上来的木头、鲸鱼骨、巨人的盔甲碎片，甚至是雪人的冰冻肢体拼凑而成。一些卷轴、书籍、羊皮纸和对开本小心翼翼地排列在架子上，都带有魔法书写的标记。",
	"If Maccath is with the characters, she can direct them to the items stolen from the Hosttower of the Arcane. She cautions the characters not to read or even peruse the material for their own safety. The writings are laced with diabolical lore that is anathema to the mortal mind.": "如果麦卡思和这些人物在一起，她可以引导他们去看从奥术之主塔偷来的物品。她告诫角色们，为了他们自己的安全，不要阅读甚至浏览这些材料。这些著作中夹杂着邪恶的传说，对凡人的思想来说是一种诅咒。",
	"Characters unable to read magic can't make any headway in the books. A character who can read magic who examines the writings must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Success indicates that the character recognizes the danger and stops reading. Failure indicates the character absorbs the power of the fiendish lore and suffers a psychic shock. While suffering this shock, the character has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and must attempt a DC 10 Constitution check to cast a spell. On a failed check, the spell cannot be cast, though the spell slot is not expended. The character can make another saving throw to end the effect each time he or she finishes a long rest.": "不能读懂魔法的角色无法在书中取得任何进展。一个能读懂魔法的角色在检查这些著作时必须做一个DC15的智慧储蓄动作。成功表明该角色认识到了危险并停止阅读。失败则表明该角色吸收了邪恶传说的力量，并遭受了精神冲击。在遭受这种冲击时，角色在攻击卷和能力检查中处于劣势，并且必须尝试用DC 10宪法检查来施展咒语。如果检定失败，则无法施法，尽管法术槽没有被消耗。该角色在每次完成长期休息后，可以再次进行蓄力以结束该效果。",
	"Arcane spellcasters can find much of value in this scriptorium, along with much that's worthless. Arauthator has collected many spellbooks from slain wizards over the centuries. More importantly for the party's immediate benefit, he also collected dozens of scrolls. Though many of those here have deteriorated from dampness or age, characters who spend a few minutes searching can find ten {@item Spell Scroll||spell scrolls}: {@spell gaseous form}, {@spell haste}, {@spell protection from energy}, {@spell water breathing}, {@spell Evard's black tentacles}, {@spell fire shield}, {@spell wall of fire}, {@spell hold monster}, {@spell chain lightning}, and {@spell disintegrate}.": "奥术施法者可以在这个书房里找到很多有价值的东西，同时也有很多没有价值的东西。几个世纪以来，Arauthator从被杀的巫师那里收集了许多法术书。更重要的是，他还收集了几十个卷轴，这对我们的直接利益来说是很重要的。虽然这里的很多都因为潮湿或年代久远而变质了，但花几分钟时间搜索的角色可以找到十本{@item Spell Scroll||spell scrolls}。{@spell gaseous form}, {@spell haste}, {@spell protection from energy}, {@spell water breathing}, {@spell Evard's black tentacles}, {@spell fire shield}, {@spell wall of fire}, {@spell hold monster}, {@spell chain lightning}, 和{@spell disintegrate}。",
	"Near the western end of the scriptorium, a 15-foot-wide chute leads down to area 19 of Arauthator's lair. The dragon can clamber up and down this passage without difficulty. Characters proficient in {@skill Athletics} can climb down the chute using crampons or some other device to grip the wall. Other characters can climb down only with ropes, pitons, and other climbing gear. The chute descends 60 feet to the roof of {@area area 19|0d4|x}, after which characters must drop 15 feet to the ice platform.": "靠近剧本馆的西端，有一条15英尺宽的滑道通往阿罗伊特的巢穴19区。龙可以毫不费力地爬上爬下这个通道。精通{@skill Athletics}的角色可以用板鞋或其他装置抓紧墙壁爬下滑道。其他角色只能用绳索、岩钉和其他攀爬装备爬下来。滑道下降了60英尺到{@area area 19|0d4|x}的屋顶，之后人物必须下降15英尺到冰台。",
	"Before the characters head down into the cavern, Maccath tells them they have no easy way back up to these chambers. Old White Death doesn't want anyone—intruders or guests—to be able to easily leave his lair.": "在人物下到洞穴之前，马卡思告诉他们，他们没有简单的方法回到这些房间。老白死神不希望任何人--入侵者或客人--能够轻易离开他的巢穴。",
	"The ice trolls that Arauthator has gathered to his service use this hall as their residence, and no other creatures are permitted here. An {@creature ice troll|RoT} has bluish, translucent skin and immunity to cold damage; it otherwise has the statistics of an ordinary troll.": "Arauthator召集的冰雪巨魔将这个大厅作为他们的住所，其他生物都不允许在这里出现。一个{@creature ice troll|RoT}拥有蓝色的、半透明的皮肤和对寒冷伤害的免疫力；除此之外，它还具有普通巨魔的统计数据。",

	"Ice pillars and pressure ridges form razor-sharp crags that loom out of the roiling fog. Streams of crackling water, magically flowing even at subzero temperatures, course thickly through the hollows beneath wind-driven, icy snow.": "冰柱和压力山脊形成尖锐的峭壁，从滚滚浓雾中隐约可见。噼里啪啦的水流，即使在零下的温度下也能神奇地流动，在风吹的冰雪下，密密麻麻地穿过空地。",
	"From the entrance, only swirling fog can be seen and only the wind can be heard. If Maccath or any ice toad is with the party, they advise the characters in the strongest possible terms to stay out of this chamber. Those who venture here aree silently surrounded and ambushed by the ice trolls. The trolls hungrily pursue the adventurers if they flee, but they heed the ice toads and refrain from attacking if the toads command them to.": "从入口处，只能看到旋转的雾气，只能听到风声。如果马卡斯或任何冰蟾和队伍在一起，他们会以最强烈的措辞建议人物不要进入这个房间。在这里冒险的人都会被冰巨魔悄悄地包围和埋伏。如果冒险者逃跑，巨魔会饥肠辘辘地追赶他们，但他们会听从冰蟾蜍的指示，在冰蟾蜍的命令下不进行攻击。",
	"The trolls speak Giant and understand a little bit of the Draconic tongue. They are willing to trade or bargain with characters who prove too difficult to kill. Only the verifiable offer of food and treasure can convince the trolls to turn against Arauthator.": "巨魔会说巨人语，并能听懂一点德拉科尼亚语。他们愿意与那些被证明难以杀死的人物进行交易或讨价还价。只有提供可证实的食物和财宝才能说服巨魔反对阿劳特。",
	"Giant ice toads serve Arauthator as overseers at Oyaviggaton. They manage the labor of the kobolds, direct the Ice Hunter villagers to provide the lair with food and other supplies, and have the patience required to deal with the ornery ice trolls.": "巨大的冰蟾蜍在奥亚维加顿作为监督者为Arauthator服务。他们管理哥布林的劳动，指挥猎冰人村民为巢穴提供食物和其他补给，并有足够的耐心来处理暴躁的冰巨魔。",
	"A bizarre sight greets you in this rough-walled chamber. About a dozen giant toads with thick, mottled white hides are at work here, scribing strange writing into the ice of the walls, or onto weathered parchment and stone tablets. A few toads transfer parchments and tablets into and out of floor-to-ceiling cubbyholes cut into the ice along the entire southern wall.": "在这个墙面粗糙的房间里，一个奇怪的景象在迎接你。大约有十几只巨大的蟾蜍，它们有着厚厚的、斑驳的白皮，正在这里工作，在墙壁的冰面上或风化的羊皮纸和石板上刻下奇怪的文字。一些蟾蜍将羊皮纸和石板移入和移出沿整个南墙开在冰上的落地小孔。",
	"A total of 11 {@creature Ice Toad|RoT|ice toads} (see {@adventure appendix D|RoT|12} for statistics) work in this chamber, scribing records and tallies into the ice using sharpened antlers or their own claws.

At regular intervals, their temporary records are transferred to more permanent form.": "共有11名{@creature Ice Toad|RoT|ice toads}(统计数字见{@adventure appendix D|RoT|12})在此工作，用削尖的鹿角或自己的爪子在冰上刻画记录和统计数字。他们还根据猎冰人村民的报告，维护移动冰海的粗略地图。每隔一段时间，他们的临时记录就会被转移到更永久的形式。",
	"See \"Random Encounters\" (above) for guidelines on how the giant ice toads respond to intruders. The characters' best chance to avoid a fight in this area—and to keep the toads from alerting the ice trolls—is to win the ice toads to their cause by treating with their leader, {@creature Marfulb|RoT}.": "关于巨型冰蟾蜍对入侵者的反应，请参见 \"随机遭遇\"（上文）的指南。角色们避免在此区域发生战斗的最好机会--防止蟾蜍惊动冰巨魔--是通过与冰蟾蜍的首领{@creature Marfulb|RoT}打交道来赢得他们的支持。",
	"In addition to data about Arauthator—his treasures, mating habits, and epic battles with frost giants and other monsters—the information amassed by the ice toads includes exhaustive details on the ever-changing Sea of Moving Ice, the weather north of the Spine of the World, and the culture of the elusive Ice Hunters. {@creature Marfulb|RoT} feels great satisfaction in her life's work, but she knows too little about society south of the Spine of the World to sense its full importance.": "除了关于Arauthator的数据--他的宝藏、交配习惯以及与冰霜巨人和其他怪物的史诗般的战斗--冰蟾所积累的信息还包括关于不断变化的移动冰海、世界之脊以北的天气以及难以捉摸的冰雪猎人文化的详尽细节。{@creature Marfulb|RoT}对她一生的工作感到非常满意，但她对世界之脊以南的社会了解太少，无法感受到其全部的重要性。",
	"Characters equipped with a {@item bag of holding} could take all the parchments and stone slabs with them when they leave Oyaviggaton. The Arcane Brotherhood would regard the lore as one of the most amazing works of natural philosophy in existence (once it is painstakingly translated from the ice toads' unique language), and they would clamor to meet and praise {@creature Marfulb|RoT}. Without a {@item bag of holding}, the collection is too large to move.": "装备了{@item bag of holding}的角色在离开奥亚维加顿时可以带走所有的羊皮纸和石板。奥术师兄弟会将把这些传说视为现存的最神奇的自然哲学作品之一（一旦它被煞费苦心地从冰蟾蜍的独特语言中翻译出来），他们会吵着要见{@creature Marfulb|RoT}并赞美它。如果没有{@item bag of holding}，这批藏品就会大得无法移动。",
	"This freezing, miserable chamber makes a perfect home for the ice toads, but is presently empty. None of the toads' belongings here has value as loot, but they make a strange and curious collection. Such objects include walrus-tooth wart scrapers, spears fashioned from narwhal horn, oddly shaped furniture sculpted into the icy floor instead of rising above it, writing implements carved from baleen and shaped for a webbed hand, and art objects that combine carved whalebone, driftwood, and mundane items such as silverware and glass stoppers salvaged from shipwrecks.": "这个冰冷、悲惨的房间是冰蟾蜍的完美家园，但目前是空的。蟾蜍们在这里的物品没有一件是有价值的战利品，但它们却组成了一个奇怪而又奇特的收藏。这些物品包括海象牙疣刮刀、独角鲸角制成的长矛、雕刻在冰冷的地板上而不是高出地板的奇怪家具、用鲸须雕刻而成的有蹼手的书写工具，以及将鲸骨雕刻、浮木和从沉船上打捞的银器和玻璃瓶等世俗物品相结合的艺术品。",

	"The terrain levels represented on the map of the cavern show increments of 8 feet. The elevation of the floor results from the ice splitting and splintering, so the ledges are abrupt and have a distinctly step-like appearance. Characters can drop down a level without difficulty. Scrambling up a level requires a successful DC 15 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check; the climber has advantage on the check if equipped with crampons or climbing gear.": "洞穴地图上代表的地形层次显示出8英尺的增量。地面的高低是由冰块的分裂造成的，所以壁架是突兀的，有明显的阶梯状外观。人物可以毫无困难地下降一层。攀登一层需要成功地进行DC15力量({@skill Athletics})检查；如果装备了板鞋或攀登装备，攀登者在检查中具有优势。",
	"The lair cavern is colder than the tunnels and chambers above it. The cavern is a bone-chilling 0 degrees Fahrenheit. Area 20 is even colder.": "巢穴洞窟比上面的隧道和密室更冷。洞穴中的温度为华氏0度，令人毛骨悚然。20号区域甚至更冷。",

	"Unlike other ledges in the cavern, the horizontal surfaces of the Icewolf's Spine aren't level. The denizens of the lair can traverse the ledges without difficulty, but any other creature that moves more than 15 feet during a round must make a DC 12 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. Failure indicates that the creature loses its footing and falls to the next level below, taking 3 ({@dice 1d6}) bludgeoning damage and landing {@condition prone}. Wearing crampons grants advantage on this check.": "与洞穴中的其他壁架不同，冰狼之脊的水平面并不平整。巢穴中的居民可以毫无困难地穿越壁架，但任何其他生物在一回合内移动超过15英尺时，必须进行DC12的灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）检查。失败表明该生物失去了立足点，并跌落到下一层，受到3({@dice 1d6})的重击伤害，落地{@condition prone}。穿着板鞋可以在这个检查中获得优势。",
	"Arauthator immediately becomes aware of intruders if the {@spell stinking cloud} is triggered. The dragon does not set off the trap if it moves through the area.": "如果{@spell stinking cloud}被触发，Arauthator会立即意识到入侵者的存在。如果龙在该区域内移动，则不会触发陷阱。",
	"This narrow passage is rigged with a magic trap. When the first character moves through the narrowest point of the passage, a {@spell slow} spell is triggered, targeting every creature in the area. Creatures affected by the spell suffer its effects for 1 minute.": "这个狭窄的通道被装上了一个魔法陷阱。当第一个角色通过通道的最窄处时，一个{@spell slow}的咒语被触发，针对该区域的每一个生物。受该咒语影响的生物会在1分钟内受到其影响。",

	"Pools of slush spread across the floor of the cavern, prevented from freezing by the seawater's high salt content. One such pool, in the westernmost angle of the cavern, conceals a flooded passage connecting to the Sea of Moving Ice. This is Arauthator's customary entrance and exit. When the dragon is reduced to 100 hit points or fewer and facing three or more foes, he dives for this exit and escapes into the frozen sea. If the dragon flees, the ice trolls retreat as well.": "泥浆池遍布洞穴的地面，由于海水含盐量高，因此不会结冰。在洞穴最西边的角度，有一个这样的池子，隐藏着一个连接到移动冰海的水淹通道。这是Arauthator惯用的入口和出口。当龙的命中率降至100或更低，并面临三个或更多的敌人时，他会潜入这个出口并逃入冰海。如果巨龙逃走了，冰巨魔也会随之撤退。",
	"If the characters defeat Arauthator, the reactions of Oyaviggaton's other inhabitants are dependent on whether the dragon is killed or driven off.": "如果角色们打败了Arauthator，Oyaviggaton的其他居民的反应就取决于龙是被杀死还是被赶走。",
	"{@b If Arauthator is killed}, the ice toads grieve, but they won't take any action against the characters. In contrast, the kobolds are furious with grief, throwing themselves at the characters in frenzied, suicidal attacks. The ice trolls' reaction will likely be influenced by whatever interaction the characters had with them earlier. The trolls might flee without a word, or they might decide they like Oyaviggaton and make it their permanent home.": "{@b If Arauthator is killed}，冰蟾蜍很悲伤，但它们不会对角色采取任何行动。与此相反，哥布林因悲痛而暴怒，以狂热的、自杀式的攻击方式向角色投掷。冰巨魔的反应可能会受到角色们之前与他们的互动的影响。巨魔可能一言不发地逃走，也可能决定喜欢奥亚维加顿并把它作为自己的永久家园。",
	"The Ice Hunters are elated over the dragon's death. When the characters emerge from the iceberg, the normally reserved villagers greet them with cheers and offers of the choicest fermented fish. The villagers then begin packing their few belongings into their hide boats and prepare to leave immediately.": "猎冰人对龙的死亡感到欣喜。当这些人物从冰山中走出来时，平时矜持的村民们欢呼着迎接他们，并提供了最美味的发酵鱼。然后，村民们开始把他们为数不多的财物装进他们的皮船，准备立即离开。",
	"{@b If Arauthator is wounded and driven off}, Maccath or {@creature Marfulb|RoT} know enough of the dragon to predict that he will spend months recovering at one of his other lairs before returning to Oyaviggaton. The Ice Hunters believe that this gives them enough time to lose themselves in the vast expanse of the Sea of Moving Ice and find a new home where Arauthator can't track them. The dragon is vengeful, but with everything else going on, Maccath believes Arauthator won't put any real effort into seeking out his former thralls. The Ice Hunters have no contact with civilization, so they can't possibly spread word of his humiliating defeat.": "{@b If Arauthator is wounded and driven off}, Maccath或{@creature Marfulb|RoT}对龙的了解足以预测他在返回奥亚维加顿之前会在他的一个其他巢穴中度过几个月的恢复期。猎冰人认为，这使他们有足够的时间在广袤的移动冰海中迷失自我，并在阿罗伊特无法追踪他们的地方找到一个新家。这条龙是报复性的，但由于发生了其他事情，马卡斯相信阿劳特不会花任何真正的精力去寻找他以前的王族。猎冰者与文明社会没有联系，所以他们不可能传播他的耻辱性失败的消息。",
	"With the dragon's disappearance, the kobolds hide if they can, while the ice toads demonstrate the same impassive stoicism they show if the dragon is killed. The ice trolls shy away from Arauthator's treasure as long as he is alive, knowing better than to come between a dragon and its hoard. They don't really care if someone else plunders items from the dragon's hoard, and they're too stupid to think they might be blamed for any such thefts.": "随着龙的消失，哥布林们尽可能地躲藏起来，而冰蟾蜍则表现出与龙被杀时一样的无动于衷。只要Arauthator还活着，冰巨魔就对他的财宝敬而远之，因为他们知道最好不要在龙和它的囤积物之间来回穿梭。他们并不关心是否有其他人从龙的囤积物中掠夺物品，而且他们太愚蠢了，认为自己可能会因为任何此类盗窃而受到指责。",
	"If Old White Death is killed or driven away, he leaves his iceberg lair's treasure hoard behind. (Because Oyaviggaton is just one of a number of minor lairs maintained by the dragon, the treasure here represents only the smallest part of his total wealth.)": "如果老白死被杀或被赶走，他就会把他的冰山巢穴的财宝囤积起来。(因为奥亚维加顿只是巨龙维护的若干小巢穴之一，这里的宝藏只代表他总财富的最小部分)。",
	"Areas 19 and 20 contain a total of 700 gp, 1,000 sp, and 20 precious stones (five each worth 200 gp, 400 gp, 600 gp, and 800 gp).

Alternatively, use the {@book treasure tables|DMG|7|Treasure Tables} in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to generate a hoard whose value is in line with your campaign.": "19区和20区共有700金币、1,000英镑和20块宝石（每块宝石价值200金币、400金币、600金币和800金币）。此外，可酌情添加药水、卷轴和魔法物品。或者，使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的{@book treasure tables|DMG|7|Treasure Tables}来生成一个价值与你的活动相一致的囤积物。",
	"To claim this treasure, it must be hacked out of the ice in the lair cavern. Doing so takes half a day (and is thus impossible if Arauthator is still in the lair).": "要想得到这个宝藏，必须把它从巢穴的冰层中砍出来。这样做需要半天时间（因此，如果阿劳特还在巢穴中，就不可能做到）。",
	"{@creature Marfulb|RoT}'s four decades of data on Arauthator is priceless to the Arcane Brotherhood (a fact Maccath will recognize if the characters don't) or to other collectors of draconic lore. If the dragon is dead, {@creature Marfulb|RoT} can be talked into letting this material be transported south, provided she gets to come along. If Arauthator still lives, the ice toad would prefer to stay and continue her work with her records intact.": "{@creature Marfulb|RoT}四十年来关于Arauthator的资料对奥术兄弟会来说是无价之宝（如果角色不认识，Maccath会认识到这一点），对其他龙族传说的收集者来说也是如此。如果龙已经死了，{@creature Marfulb|RoT}可以被说服让这些材料被运往南方，只要她能一起去。如果Arauthator还活着，冰蟾更愿意留下来继续她的工作，并保留她的记录。",
	"Arauthator is a strong ally of the Cult of the Dragon, and the adventurers deal a solid blow to the cult by defeating him.

	"The attack lasted only a short while, then the dragon unexpectedly retreated. The cultists followed, but as they fled, they took nothing of value from the village. This is a stark contrast to the dragon's other raids, which were focused on capturing treasure.": "攻击只持续了一小会儿，然后龙意外地撤退了。邪教徒们紧随其后，但在逃离时，他们没有从村子里带走任何有价值的东西。这与龙的其他突袭形成了鲜明的对比，这些突袭的重点是夺取财宝。",
	"Galin the warden is a nervous-looking elf with a dark secret. The folk of the village describe him as suffering from the weight of his new leadership role and the deaths of more than a hundred villagers—including his own wife.": "典狱长加林是一个看起来很紧张的精灵，有一个黑暗的秘密。村里的人说他被新的领导角色和一百多个村民的死亡（包括他自己的妻子）所困扰。",
	"In response to any question about Galin, the characters are directed to his residence in the upper boughs of the village.": "在回答关于加林的任何问题时，人物都被引导到他在村子上层树桠的住所。",
	"Stepping into a modest dwelling suspended among iron-strong boughs, you enter a cozy sitting room. A slim elf sits at a desk, standing to greet you with a forced smile as a raven perched in a nearby cage caws hideously. \"Welcome to our village,\" the elf says. \"How can I be of service?\"": "踏入一个悬挂在铁质枝桠间的简陋住所，你进入一个舒适的起居室。一个瘦小的精灵坐在书桌前，站起来强颜欢笑地迎接你，一只栖息在附近笼子里的乌鸦狰狞地叫着。\"欢迎来到我们的村庄，\"精灵说。\"我能为你做什么？\"",
	"Galin answers any questions the characters put to him, but his responses echo only what the other survivors know. He claims to have not seen the dragon rider and disbelieves those who say they did, dismissing such reports as the result of fear and chaos during the raid. A successful DC 18 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check reveals that the elf warden is withholding information. If he is pressed on this, he admits that he saw the dragon kill his wife and is wracked by guilt that he could not save her. A follow-up successful DC 16 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check reveals that even this isn't the whole truth, but Galin takes umbrage if the character ply him with any more questions.": "加林回答了人物向他提出的任何问题，但他的回答只回应了其他幸存者知道的情况。他声称没有看到龙骑士，并且不相信那些说他们看到了的人，认为这些报告是突袭中的恐惧和混乱造成的。成功通过DC18智慧({@skill Insight})检查，可以发现精灵典狱长在隐瞒信息。如果他被问及此事，他承认他看到龙杀死了他的妻子，并且因为没能救她而感到内疚。后续成功的DC16智慧检查显示，即使这不是全部的事实，但如果人物再向他提问，加林就会感到不满。",
	"If the characters use {@spell speak with animals} to question the raven, they learn that Galin walked a mile or more into the woods and came face to face with the green dragon Chuth and his rider the previous night. Remember that an animal intelligence is not as articulate as a humanoid, and it might take subtle coaxing to get the raven to describe a scene that likely frightened it.": "如果角色使用{@spell speak with animals}来询问乌鸦，他们会了解到加林在森林里走了一英里或更远，并在前一天晚上与绿龙楚斯和他的骑手面对面。记住，动物的智慧不像人那样善于表达，可能需要巧妙的哄骗才能让乌鸦描述出可能吓到它的场景。",
	"The characters might also choose to watch and follow Galin on one of his late night excursions. {@creature Neronvain|RoT} does not show up that night, but the warden's prearranged meeting place is a spot of flattened brush where a dragon has clearly landed more than once.": "人物也可以选择观察和跟踪加林的一次深夜出游。{@creature Neronvain|RoT}当晚没有出现，但典狱长预先安排的会面地点是一处被压扁的灌木丛，显然龙已经在那里降落了不止一次。",
	"Galin will not respond to intimidation. However, effective roleplaying can be used to tap into his guilt. If he is offered commiseration for his wife's death—as opposed to accusations—the warden eventually breaks down. He confesses that after seeing his wife killed, he found himself face to face with {@creature Neronvain|RoT} in the thick of battle and begged for his life, offering anything in return. {@creature Neronvain|RoT} took the warden up on his offer, agreeing to spare Galin and leave Altand intact in exchange for information on other settlements that would become the targets of the cult's next round of raids.": "加林不会对恐吓做出反应。然而，可以利用有效的角色扮演来挖掘他的内疚感。如果有人对他妻子的死表示同情--而不是指责，监狱长最终会崩溃。他承认在看到他的妻子被杀后，他发现自己在激烈的战斗中与{@creature Neronvain|RoT}面对面，并乞求他的生命，提供任何回报。{@creature Neronvain|RoT}接受了典狱长的提议，同意放过加林，让阿尔坦德完好无损，以换取其他定居点的信息，这些定居点将成为邪教下一轮袭击的目标。",
	"Galin does not know the identity of the green wyrmspeaker, or the location of {@creature Neronvain|RoT} and Chuth's lair. However, from the meeting place, he has watched": "加林不知道绿色巫师的身份，也不知道{@creature Neronvain|RoT}和楚斯的巢穴的位置。然而，从会面的地方，他已经观察到了",
	"the dragon flying off on a course due southeast and he has noticed that the wyrmspeaker's clothes and hair are often wet.": "他注意到巫师的衣服和头发经常是湿的，而龙在东南方向飞走了。",
	"{@creature Neronvain|RoT}'s stronghold lies thirty miles from Altand through dense, fog-filled forest. As they seek the wyrmspeaker and his dragon, the characters meet an old druid and must deal with spidery sentries.": "{@creature Neronvain|RoT}的据点位于离阿尔坦德30英里的地方，穿过浓密的、充满雾气的森林。在寻找巫师和他的龙的过程中，角色们遇到了一个老德鲁伊，并必须对付蜘蛛般的哨兵。",
	"If the characters help the druid without reservation, read the following.": "如果这些人物毫无保留地帮助德鲁伊，请阅读以下内容。",
	"It takes all your effort to lift the tree, knowing that you put yourselves at risk if it shifts against you. But then even as you are close to freeing the woman, the tree begins to rise on its own. Two other trees standing nearby shift back along the ground as the elf stands and smiles, showing no sign of injury.": "你们花了所有的力气来抬起这棵树，知道如果这棵树向你们倾斜，你们就会把自己置于危险之中。但是，即使在你接近释放这个女人的时候，这棵树开始自己上升。站在附近的另外两棵树沿着地面向后移，因为精灵站着并微笑着，没有受伤的迹象。",
	"\"Heroes at last!\" she says. \"How many might fall back in fear at the sight of a stranger in the woods, or think first of their own safety before helping another? I grant you my blessing. May your hearts prove true where others fear to tread.\"": "\"终于有英雄了！\"她说。\"有多少人在看到森林里的陌生人时可能会害怕而退缩，或者在帮助别人之前首先考虑自己的安全？我向你们表示祝福。愿你们的心在别人不敢踏足的地方证明是真的。\"",
	"The woman picks flowers from her hair that you swear were not there a moment ago, then twists her fingers to weave them into garlands as if by magic. She lays a garland around each of your necks, then suddenly transforms into an owl. Her awakened tree servants stomp after her into the forest.": "这个女人从她的头发上摘下你发誓刚才还没有的花朵，然后像变魔术一样用手指把它们编成花环。她在你们每个人的脖子上挂了一个花环，然后突然变身为猫头鹰。她那被唤醒的树上的仆人在她身后跺着脚进入森林。",
	"As long as the characters wear these garlands, they are {@condition invisible} to Chuth's animal spies (part of the magic imbued into the area around the dragon's lair) as they approach {@creature Neronvain|RoT}'s stronghold. In addition, the first time a character wearing a garland is confronted by Chuth, he or she feels a stirring warmth from the garland and automatically succeeds on the saving throw against the dragon's Frightful Presence.": "只要角色戴着这些花环，当他们接近{@creature Neronvain|RoT}龙的据点时，对楚斯的动物间谍来说，他们就是{@condition invisible}的动物间谍（龙的巢穴周围被灌输的魔法的一部分）。此外，戴着花环的角色第一次面对楚斯时，会感受到花环带来的刺激性温暖，并自动成功抵御龙的可怕存在。",
	"If the characters ignore the druid, she calls out pitifully for help as they move away, offering a last lament against their cowardice as they disappear. If the adventurers attack the druid, the awakened trees attack. They fight to the death as the druid turns into an owl and flies away.": "如果角色无视德鲁伊，她会在他们离开时可怜地呼救，在他们消失时对他们的懦弱发出最后的哀叹。如果冒险者攻击德鲁伊，被唤醒的树木就会攻击。当德鲁伊变成猫头鹰飞走时，他们就会拼命地战斗。",
	"The Green Wyrmspeaker has established a stronghold for himself and Chuth within a cave complex in the Misty Forest, its entrance hidden behind a waterfall that tumbles down a high cliff. The green dragon has taken over the largest cavern of the stronghold as one of its many lairs.": "绿语者为自己和楚斯在迷雾森林的一个洞穴群中建立了一个据点，其入口隐藏在一个从高崖上滚落的瀑布后面。绿龙占据了据点中最大的洞穴，作为它众多巢穴中的一个。",
	"Secret doors inside the stronghold are little more than cracks between chambers, just large enough for Medium creatures to squeeze through. They are obscured behind loose rocks or other cover, and require a DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to notice.": "堡垒内部的密门只是房间之间的裂缝，大到足以让中型生物挤过去。它们被掩盖在松散的岩石或其他掩体后面，需要通过DC14智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查才能发现。",
	"The stronghold is dark unless otherwise noted.": "除非另有说明，否则该据点是黑暗的。",
	"The pool at the foot of the waterfall is 20 feet deep at its center, its surface obscured by an emerald haze that marks this place as a green dragon's lair.": "瀑布脚下的水池中心有20英尺深，其表面被翡翠色的雾气所遮蔽，标志着这里是绿龙的巢穴。",
	"If the characters wear the garlands given to them by the druid, Chuth has no idea of their approach, allowing them to safely pass through this area and into the caves.": "如果人物戴上德鲁伊给他们的花环，楚斯就不知道他们的行踪，从而使他们能够安全地通过这个区域，进入山洞。",
	"Chuth uses his {@sense blindsight} to detect when the characters are approaching the entrance to the cave. He then dives through the waterfall, soaring above the characters as he uses his Poison Breath, attacking with surprise if no one in the party noticed him. Characters not wearing the garlands are also exposed to the dragon's Frightful Presence. Characters who fail their saving throws against Frightful Presence likely flee back into the woods, where spiders might be waiting. On the dragon's next turn, it retreats back to area 2 to await the heroes' next move.": "丘特用他的{@sense blindsight}探测到人物接近洞口的时候。然后他潜入瀑布，在使用他的毒气时翱翔于人物之上，如果队伍中没有人注意到他，他就会出其不意地攻击。没有佩戴花环的角色也会被暴露在龙的恐怖存在之下。对惊恐的存在判断失败的角色可能会逃回树林里，那里可能有蜘蛛在等着。在龙的下一个回合，它退回到2区，等待英雄们的下一步行动。",
	"Even if they are fooled initially, the elves become suspicious if the characters begin to ask any questions that cultists should know (including questions about {@creature Neronvain|RoT}, Chuth, or the stronghold). In this event, the elves call out for help and attack at once.": "即使他们一开始被骗了，如果角色开始问任何邪教徒应该知道的问题（包括关于{@creature Neronvain|RoT}、楚斯或据点的问题），精灵们也会变得怀疑。在这种情况下，精灵们会大声呼救，并立即发动攻击。",
	"The dragon's roar signals the start of the fight for the servants of Chuth and {@creature Neronvain|RoT} lying in wait for the adventurers. The elves fire bows from atop the bluff of area 4, while the {@creature Ettin||ettins} and cultists wade into melee beside their master. See areas 3, 4, and 5 for creature stats and information. {@creature Neronvain|RoT} attacks at range from behind the cultists, staying close to the entrance to areas 5 and {@area 6|149|x}.": "龙的咆哮预示着楚斯的仆人和{@creature Neronvain|RoT}等待冒险者的战斗开始了。精灵们从4号区域的悬崖顶上发射弓箭，而{@creature Ettin||ettins}和邪教徒则在他们的主人身边涉足近战。有关生物的统计和信息，请看3、4、5区。{@creature Neronvain|RoT}从邪教徒身后进行远程攻击，靠近5号和{@area 6|149|x}区域的入口。",
	"If the characters kill or incapacitate all of {@creature Neronvain|RoT} and Chuth's servants, the dragon hides in the pool and emerges each time his breath weapon recharges. While hiding in the water, the dragon is heavily obscured.Chuth is amphibious and can use any of his attacks underwater, as well as his lair actions. Characters swimming through the underwater passage might be suddenly restrained by underwater vines, making them easy targets for the dragon's breath weapon, or putting them at risk of drowning if they cannot free themselves.": "如果角色们杀死了{@creature Neronvain|RoT}和楚斯的所有仆人或使其丧失能力，龙就会躲在池子里，每次他的呼吸武器充能时就会出现。躲在水中时，龙会被严重遮蔽。楚斯是水陆两栖的，可以在水下使用他的任何攻击，以及他的巢穴行动。游过水下通道的角色可能会突然被水下的藤蔓束缚住，使他们很容易成为龙的呼吸武器的目标，或者使他们在无法挣脱时有被淹死的危险。",
	"With a bit of clever roleplaying, the characters might be able to incite the ettins to fight one another. This costs each ettin 21 hit points and keeps them busy for 10 minutes as they wrestle and shout.": "通过巧妙的角色扮演，角色们也许能够煽动ETTIN们互相争斗。这将使每个ETTIN损失21点命中率，并使他们在摔跤和喊叫中忙碌10分钟。",
	"The leader of the ettins is a female named Grunda-Gurga. She has a {@item belt of hill giant strength} but wears it improperly as a sash, receiving none of its benefits and having no awareness of its magical potential.": "埃廷斯的领袖是一位名叫格鲁达-古尔加的女性。她有一个{@item belt of hill giant strength}，但作为腰带佩戴不当，没有得到任何好处，也没有意识到其神奇的潜力。",
	"{@creature Neronvain|RoT} and Chuth brought a dozen elves back from their raids in the Misty Forest as prisoners—8 {@creature Commoner||commoners}, 3 {@creature Noble||nobles} with whom {@creature Neronvain|RoT} converses on occasion, and a {@creature knight} and {@creature mage} who are Chuth's playthings.": "{@creature Neronvain|RoT}和楚斯从迷雾森林的袭击中带回来十几个精灵作为俘虏--8个{@creature Commoner||commoners}，3个{@creature Noble||nobles}，{@creature Neronvain|RoT}偶尔与之交谈，还有一个{@creature knight}和{@creature mage}，是楚斯的玩物。",
	"If the characters have entered the caverns undetected, any elves not on guard duty (see area 2) are here. As long as no alarm has been raised, the elves are hesitant to attack possible guests of {@creature Neronvain|RoT} or Chuth, but they remain suspicious.": "如果人物在未被发现的情况下进入岩洞，那么任何没有在守卫的精灵（见区域2）都在这里。只要没有发出警报，精灵们对攻击可能是{@creature Neronvain|RoT}或Chuth的客人犹豫不决，但他们仍然很怀疑。",
	"The elves are terrified of Chuth, and the cunning dragon has convinced them that he will free them in time if they are loyal. It takes convincing roleplaying and a DC 17 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check to convince the elves to flee rather than wait around for the dragon to eventually tire of and eat them. If the characters received the garlands from the druid and place them on the elves, this automatically convinces them to safely flee.": "精灵们都很害怕楚斯，而这只狡猾的龙让他们相信，如果他们忠诚，他就会及时释放他们。这需要令人信服的角色扮演和DC17魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查来说服精灵们逃离，而不是等待龙最终厌倦并吃掉他们。如果人物从德鲁伊那里得到了花环，并把它们放在精灵身上，这就会自动说服它们安全逃离。",
	"This area is brightly lit by torches set into roughly carved wall sconces. Long tables made of split logs are where the cultists sit to eat or entertain themselves. A cooking fire burns in the center of the room, its smoke rising out to the central cavern and then out of the caves.": "这个区域被镶嵌在粗糙雕刻的壁灯上的火把照得很明亮。用劈开的原木制成的长桌是邪教徒们坐下来吃饭或娱乐的地方。房间中央燃烧着炊火，其烟雾升到中央洞穴，然后又升到洞穴外。",
	"Hidden under the mattresses in the bunks are a total of 30 gp, 120 sp, 23 ep, and 200 cp, plus a single 5 pound silver trade bar from Baldur's Gate (20 gp).": "在床铺的床垫下藏着总共30GP、120SP、23EP和200CP，外加一根来自博德之门的5磅银质贸易条（20GP）。",
	"The cult keeps considerable quantities of food and alcohol here. Judging by the volume of these stores, {@creature Neronvain|RoT} is planning a long series of assaults against the elves of the Misty Forest.": "邪教组织在这里保留了相当数量的食物和酒。从这些仓库的数量来看，{@creature Neronvain|RoT}正在计划对迷雾森林的精灵进行一长串的攻击。",
	"The food is mostly common fare, but {@creature Neronvain|RoT}'s personal stock includes 8 bottles of Evermead, each worth 100 gp. Since contact with the elven island of Evermeet is so rare, it is easy to find a buyer.": "食物大多是普通的食物，但{@creature Neronvain|RoT}的个人库存包括8瓶Evermead，每瓶价值100gp。由于与精灵岛的Evermeet接触非常少，所以很容易找到买家。",
	"{@creature Neronvain|RoT} has created a lush living space in this rough-walled cavern, decorating it with select art and craftworks from his raids. Rich carpets and tapestries cover the floor and walls of the cavern, which features a hewn-log bed, a large mirror, and a trunk.": "{@creature Neronvain|RoT}在这个壁垒森严的洞穴里创造了一个郁郁葱葱的生活空间，用他搜刮来的精选艺术品和手工艺品来装饰它。丰富的地毯和挂毯覆盖了洞穴的地板和墙壁，里面有一张凿开的木床、一面大镜子和一个箱子。",
	"The entrance tunnel to this chamber is protected by a {@spell glyph of warding} attuned to {@creature Neronvain|RoT}. A DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check notices the glyph. If anyone but {@creature Neronvain|RoT} steps within 5 feet of the glyph, it erupts.All creatures within 20 feet of the glyph must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 ({@dice 5d8}) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.": "这个房间的入口通道被一个与{@creature Neronvain|RoT}相适应的{@spell glyph of warding}所保护。通过DC14智力测验可以注意到这个石刻。如果除了{@creature Neronvain|RoT}以外的任何人走到石刻的5英尺范围内，它就会喷发。所有在石刻20英尺范围内的生物都必须做一个DC14的灵巧救赎，如果救赎失败，会受到22({@dice 5d8})的酸液伤害，如果救赎成功，会受到一半的伤害。",
	"If {@creature Neronvain|RoT} is in the stronghold, he is found in this area only if the characters have managed to come this far without engaging in any combat or causing any alert to be sounded. He is otherwise encountered when he enters the fight against the characters.": "如果{@creature Neronvain|RoT}在据点里，只有当人物成功地走到这里而没有参与任何战斗或导致任何警报响起时，才会在这个区域发现他。否则，当他进入与角色的战斗中时，就会遇到他。",
	"If the characters can collect all the furniture, carpets, tapestries, and art objects from this area, the lot is worth a total of 1,500 gp. However, it should occur to the characters that these goods are the rightful property of the elves they were stolen from.": "如果人物能够收集到这一区域的所有家具、地毯、挂毯和艺术品，那么这批物品的总价值为1,500GP。然而，人物应该想到，这些货物是他们被盗的精灵的合法财产。",
	"This secret room is for {@creature Neronvain|RoT}'s personal use only. A small shrine to Fenmarel Mestarine—the elven god of outcasts, scapegoats, and solitude—resembles a pair of white eyes peering out from the dark wall above a small basin.": "这个密室仅供{@creature Neronvain|RoT}个人使用。一个供奉芬玛勒-梅斯塔林的小神龛--精灵族的弃儿、替罪羊和孤独之神--像一双白色的眼睛，从小盆地上方的黑墙中探出。",
	"Also present here is a journal that reveals {@creature Neronvain|RoT}'s relationship to King Melandrach, whom {@creature Neronvain|RoT} refers to frequently as \"my poor father.\" The journal also reveals that the {@item Green Dragon Mask|RoTOS} is already at the Well of Dragons, under {@creature Severin|RoT}'s protection and ready to be assembled into the {@item Mask of the Dragon Queen|RoT}.": "这里还有一本日记，揭示了{@creature Neronvain|RoT}与Melandrach国王的关系，{@creature Neronvain|RoT}经常把他称为 \"我可怜的父亲\"。这本日记还显示，{@item Green Dragon Mask|RoTOS}已经在龙之井，在{@creature Severin|RoT}的保护下，准备被组装成{@item Mask of the Dragon Queen|RoT}。",
	"No one but the dragon and {@creature Neronvain|RoT} are allowed in this area. Along the east wall is Chuth's portion of the hoard collected from the elves of the Misty Forest, though this pales in comparison to what the cult claimed for {@creature Tiamat|RoT} and what the dragon possesses in his other lairs. The vaulted ceiling is 60 feet high here.": "除了龙和{@creature Neronvain|RoT}之外，没有人可以进入这个区域。沿着东墙是楚斯从迷雾森林的精灵那里收集来的那部分囤积物，尽管与邪教声称的{@creature Tiamat|RoT}和龙在其他巢穴中拥有的东西相比，这些东西相形见绌。这里的拱顶有60英尺高。",
	"If Chuth is in the stronghold, he is initially found here only if the characters have come this far without engaging in any combat or sounding any alarm, or if he and {@creature Neronvain|RoT} have retreated to the lair.

	"Because this is only a small portion of his total hoard, Chuth has no interest in dying to protect it. He flees when he is reduced to half his hit points or fewer. {@creature Neronvain|RoT} fights until similarly reduced, then makes his way to Chuth and convinces the dragon to flee the caverns.": "因为这只是他全部囤积物的一小部分，所以楚斯没有兴趣为保护它而死。当他的生命值减少到一半或更少时，他就会逃走。{@creature Neronvain|RoT}战斗到类似的减分，然后赶到楚斯那里，说服龙逃离洞穴。",

	"The cult's attacks can happen anywhere, but the characters are at greatest risk while on their home ground. The cult wants its enemies to know that they aren't safe anywhere. If the characters ever split up to pursue separate missions in what seem like safe environments, the cult is almost certain to strike.": "邪教的攻击可以发生在任何地方，但人物在他们的主场时面临的风险最大。邪教组织希望它的敌人知道，他们在任何地方都不安全。如果角色们在看似安全的环境中分散开来执行不同的任务，邪教几乎肯定会发动攻击。",
	"The cult's first attack against the heroes is a measured assault designed to deliver a warning.": "邪教对英雄们的第一次攻击是一次有分寸的攻击，旨在发出一个警告。",
	"This attack can occur anywhere. The cult has no concern for innocent bystanders, but the encounter will be easier for you to run without a panicking crowd to deal with. This combat encounter should occur after a previous combat encounter has drained some of the characters' resources, but before they can finish a long rest.": "这种攻击可以发生在任何地方。邪教对无辜的旁观者并不关心，但如果没有惊慌失措的人群来对付，这场遭遇战会让你跑得更轻松。这个战斗遭遇应该发生在之前的战斗遭遇耗尽了人物的一些资源之后，但在他们能够完成长时间的休息之前。",
	"The assailants the cult throws against the characters should be adjusted for the strength of the party.

	"If the characters are staying at an inn, the cultists might opt for a direct assault, crashing through the front door. A more subtle approach sees them enter the inn a few at a time disguised as customers, then attacking when they have the characters outnumbered and surrounded. The dragon is unlikely to enter the inn building, opting to use its breath weapon through the windows or attacking any characters or bystanders who step outside.": "如果角色们住在旅馆里，邪教分子可能会选择直接攻击，从前门冲进去。一种更隐蔽的方法是，他们每次进入旅店时，先伪装成顾客，然后在人物人数较少且被包围时进行攻击。龙不太可能进入客栈的建筑，它会选择通过窗户使用它的呼吸武器，或者攻击任何走出去的人物或旁观者。",
	"As the characters are traveling, the cultists can get ahead of them and lay an ambush. Alternatively, cultists might follow the party at a distance by day, then move closer when the characters stop to rest for the night. A surprise attack in the dark or at dawn is particularly dangerous, granting the dragon complete freedom of movement and creating the possibility that some party members will be asleep or unarmored.": "当人物在旅行时，邪教分子可以走在他们前面并设下埋伏。另外，邪教分子可能会在白天远远地跟着队伍，然后在人物停下来休息过夜时靠近。在黑暗中或黎明时分的突然袭击特别危险，因为它给予了龙完全的行动自由，并创造了一些党员睡着或没有盔甲的可能性。",
	"Because the cult has underestimated the heroes' strength, this first assault is doomed to fail. However, try to ensure that at least one cultist escapes to report what happened. If no one gets away alive, leave signs that other cultists were hanging back as reinforcements, but fled when the original force was overwhelmed.": "因为邪教低估了英雄们的力量，所以这第一次攻击注定要失败。但是，要尽量保证至少有一个邪教人员逃脱，报告所发生的事情。如果没有人活着离开，就留下痕迹，表明其他邪教分子作为援军在后方徘徊，但在原来的部队被压倒时逃跑了。",
	"Make sure the characters understand what this attack was about. If it makes sense for the circumstances of the attack, the cultists will be dressed in full regalia, complete with masks and dragon-wing capes.

You cannot stop us!\"": "确保人物明白这次袭击是为了什么。如果对这次攻击的情况来说是合理的，那么邪教分子将身着盛装，戴着面具，穿着龙翼披风。濒临死亡的邪教徒应该用他们最后的呼吸来诅咒角色，并感叹道：\"龙的崛起！你无法阻止我们！你无法阻止我们！\"",
	"The first attack established that the heroes are an even more dangerous threat than the cult believed. In this second encounter, a stronger cult force attacks to kill.": "第一次攻击确定了英雄们是比邪教相信的更危险的威胁。在这第二次遭遇中，一股更强大的邪教力量发动了攻击，要杀人。",
	"Place this encounter at a point when the characters are not at their strongest or most well prepared.

In particular, if the attack comes during a long rest but before the characters have finished that rest, they won't yet have recovered full hit points, spells, and other resources. Such an attack puts the characters at a huge disadvantage, but reinforces that the Cult of the Dragon wants the adventurers dead.": "在人物不是最强壮或准备最充分的时候安排这个遭遇战。等到他们被打散了，他们的法术和功能被之前的战斗耗尽了，或者他们受伤了，治疗能力不足。特别是，如果攻击发生在长时间的休息期间，但在人物完成那次休息之前，他们还没有恢复全部命中率、法术和其他资源。这样的攻击使人物处于巨大的劣势，但却强化了龙之教想要冒险者死亡的事实。",
	"A dramatic location works best for this attack. The cultists not only want to eliminate a threat, they want to send a message to all others who oppose them. Attacking at an important public building such as a major temple or a palace declares that no place is safe from the cult, while an assault at a large marketplace or a royal garden guarantees a maximum number of witnesses.": "一个戏剧性的地点对这种攻击最有效。邪教分子不仅想消除威胁，他们还想向所有反对他们的人发出信息。攻击重要的公共建筑，如主要的寺庙或宫殿，宣布没有一个地方是安全的，而攻击大型市场或皇家花园，则保证有尽可能多的证人。",
	"The second attack force comprises a team led by a {@creature dragonsoul|RoT} cultist (see {@adventure appendix D|RoT|12}). If this is an isolated fight with the characters at or near full strength, choose adversaries that create a deadly encounter. If the adventurers are weakened from earlier encounters, aim for a hard encounter instead.": "第二支攻击部队包括一个由{@creature dragonsoul|RoT}邪教徒领导的团队（见{@adventure appendix D|RoT|12}）。如果这是一场孤立的战斗，人物处于或接近全盛状态，那么就选择能创造致命遭遇的对手。如果冒险者在之前的遭遇战中被削弱了，那就以艰难的遭遇战为目标。",
	"Don't be reluctant to use forces that are likely to kill one or more characters. The destruction of the heroes is the goal of this attack, and if the risk of death doesn't feel real, the players won't take the threat of the cult seriously.": "不要勉强使用可能会杀死一个或多个角色的力量。毁灭英雄是这次攻击的目标，如果死亡的风险感觉不真实，玩家就不会认真对待邪教的威胁。",
	"These attackers know more about their targets than the first group did, thanks to the survivors from that battle.": "这些攻击者比第一批人更了解他们的目标，这要归功于那场战斗的幸存者。",
	"The attackers launch their assault while the characters are visiting an important location crowded with innocent bystanders. The black dragon begins by tearing off a section of the roof to incite as much terror as possible. While the characters are distracted by that assault, {@condition invisible} nycaloths move in and attack with surprise. The mezzoloths use {@spell cloudkill} to surround the characters, unconcerned about NPCs caught up in the attack.": "袭击者在人物访问一个挤满无辜旁观者的重要地点时发起攻击。黑龙一开始就撕掉了屋顶的一部分，以尽可能地煽动恐怖。当角色们被这次攻击分散注意力时，{@condition invisible}尼卡洛特人进入并发动了突袭。狼牙棒使用{@spell cloudkill}来包围角色，对被攻击的NPC毫不在意。",
	"An attack in a marketplace, garden, or some other outdoor location opens with the black dragon and one or more flying nycaloths appearing overhead to create a panic. The cultists are hanging on to the dragon, but they drop down to engage the party in melee while the dragon circles above, attacking with its breath weapon and using its Frightful Presence on rounds when its breath is still recharging. While the crowd inhibits the characters' movement, mezzoloths can easily and rapidly teleport through it.": "在集市、花园或其他户外场所的攻击中，黑龙和一只或多只飞蛾出现在头顶，制造恐慌。邪教徒们被挂在龙身上，但他们会掉下来与党派进行近战，而龙则在上面盘旋，用它的呼吸武器进行攻击，并在它的呼吸还在充能的时候使用它的恐怖存在进行回合。虽然人群抑制了角色的移动，但马佐洛特人可以轻松而迅速地穿过它。",
	"Don't be afraid to engage in some triumphal monologuing by the dragonsoul cultist leading the attack. Whether the attackers are winning or losing, the cultist fights with cries of \"The dragons rise!\" and \"We are unstoppable!\" At some point, the leader lets important information slip: \"The Masks are joined, the call has sounded! Soon the Gates of the Nine Hells shall swing wide and She shall return!\"": "不要害怕领导进攻的龙魂崇拜者进行一些胜利的独白。无论攻击者是赢是输，邪教者都会以 \"龙族崛起！\"和 \"我们是不可阻挡的！\"的呼声进行战斗。在某些时候，领导者泄露了重要信息。\"面具人已经加入，召唤已经响起! 很快，九层地狱之门将大开，她将回来！\"",
	"As with the first assault on the adventurers, try to ensure that if the attackers are defeated, at least one escapes to report the outcome of the battle. Most easily, the dragon can fly away if the battle turns against it.": "与第一次袭击冒险者一样，尽量保证如果袭击者被打败，至少有一个人逃出来报告战斗的结果。最容易的是，如果战斗结果对它不利，龙可以飞走。",
	"The yugoloths were summoned by Red Wizards and paid by the cult to kill the adventurers, but they have no loyalty to their benefactors. If a yugoloth takes damage from a single attack that deals more than half its remaining hit points, it withdraws from combat on its next turn. If it hasn't already tried to summon another yugoloth, it does so immediately. If it's already used that power, it simply flees, intending to regroup with other survivors later.": "这些尤格立斯是由红袍巫师召唤出来的，并由邪教付钱给他们来杀死冒险者，但他们对他们的恩人并不忠诚。如果尤格罗特受到一次攻击的伤害超过其剩余命中率的一半，它将在下一回合退出战斗。如果它还没有试图召唤另一个尤戈洛人，它就会立即这样做。如果它已经使用了这种力量，它就会简单地逃走，打算以后与其他幸存者重新组合。",
	"Because the yugoloths are mercenaries, the characters can attempt to buy them off with a better offer—one that not only exceeds what the cult is paying but covers the damage to reputation that comes from changing sides in the middle of battle. A good starting offer is 10,000 gp, or 2,000 gp per yugoloth if more than five of them are in the fight.": "由于尤戈洛人是雇佣兵，角色们可以尝试用更好的报价来收买他们--这个报价不仅要超过邪教所支付的费用，还要包括在战斗中改变立场所造成的声誉损失。一个好的开价是10,000金币，如果超过5个尤格罗人参加战斗，则每个尤格罗人可以得到2,000金币。",
	"In addition to damaging bystanders, this encounter can easily destroy buildings and great landmarks. This formidable assault should provide a sense of the destruction that will wash over the Sword Coast if the Cult of the Dragon is successful in its plans.": "除了伤害旁人之外，这种遭遇可以轻易地摧毁建筑物和伟大的地标。如果神龙教的计划获得成功，这种强大的攻击应该能让人感受到剑海岸将面临的破坏。",
	"The characters gain a level at the end of this event.": "角色在这个事件结束时获得一个等级。",
	"The second attack was meant to finish off the heroes. If a third attack proves necessary, the cult escalates to the highest level.": "第二次攻击是为了解决英雄们的问题。如果证明有必要进行第三次攻击，邪教就会升级到最高级别。",
	"If nothing else, the second attack should impress on the characters that the first attack wasn't a fluke or a one-time event. They have a price on their heads. Additionally, the potency of the second attack should make the characters understand that if a third strike is even more powerful than the second, they won't survive. If it doesn't occur to the players that the characters should take steps to protect themselves, a concerned NPC can make the suggestion.": "如果不出意外的话，第二次攻击应该让角色们印象深刻，第一次攻击并不是侥幸或一次性事件。他们的头顶上有一个价格。此外，第二次攻击的威力应该使角色们明白，如果第三次攻击比第二次攻击更强大，他们将无法生存。如果玩家们没有想到人物应该采取措施保护自己，那么一个关心他们的NPC可以提出建议。",
	"This attack can occur in any settlement the characters are staying in or passing through. Ideally, use a location where one or more characters have homes or family.": "这种攻击可以发生在人物逗留或经过的任何定居点。理想的情况是，使用一个或多个角色有家或家人的地方。",
	"After the second cult attack, allow the characters to complete one or two chapters of the adventure before the cult makes this final attempt on their lives. Because this attack is an all-out assault, the characters should have full access to spells, healing, and other resources.": "在邪教的第二次攻击之后，在邪教对他们的生命进行最后的尝试之前，让角色们完成冒险的一到两章内容。因为这次攻击是一次全面的攻击，所以人物应该能够充分使用法术、治疗和其他资源。",
	"Enough chromatic dragons have responded to the {@item Draakhorn|RoT|Draakhorn's} call that a full flight of young red dragons can be dispatched to deal with the heroes once and for all. For this final assault, the cult bolsters the red dragons with a handful of cultists, half-dragons, and Red Wizards (mages) who are members of Rath Modar's splinter sect. The cultists and Red Wizards arrive on the backs of the red dragons.": "足够多的色龙响应了{@item Draakhorn|RoT|Draakhorn's}的号召，可以派出一整队年轻的红龙来彻底解决英雄们的问题。在这最后的攻击中，邪教用少量的邪教徒、半龙人和红袍巫师（法师）来支持红龙，他们是拉斯-莫达尔的分裂教派成员。邪教徒和红袍巫师是在红龙的背上到达的。",
	"Make this a deadly encounter—and not just by the numbers prescribed in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|3|Creating a Combat Encounter}{@i}. By now, the cult knows how the characters fight, and so do you. Sometimes players can make a group of characters tougher than their basic game statistics indicate. If that's the case for your group, take that into account when selecting the attacking force.": "让这是一场致命的遭遇战--不仅仅是通过{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|3|Creating a Combat Encounter}{@i}中规定的数字。现在，邪教组织知道这些角色是如何战斗的，你也知道。有时，玩家可以让一组角色比他们的基本游戏统计数字显示的更强硬。如果你的小组是这种情况，在选择攻击力量时要考虑到这一点。",
	"This encounter should challenge the adventurers in every way. The characters should be no easy match for the attacking force, such that retreat and escape might be their best option if they hope to survive. However, if the characters haven't made escape plans ahead of time, the attackers will have taken steps to make retreat impossible. The specifics are up to you, but should be based around any obvious features of the encounter area. Standard escape paths such as back doors and known sewer entrances will be watched, and tactics the characters have used before will be known. Only a special escape route—a secret passage known only to a palace's most trusted servants, for example—should come as a surprise to the cultists and Red Wizards.": "这次遭遇战应该在各个方面挑战冒险者。角色们应该不是攻击部队的简单对手，如果他们希望活下来，撤退和逃跑可能是他们最好的选择。但是，如果人物没有提前制定逃跑计划，攻击者就会采取措施使他们无法撤退。具体细节由你决定，但应围绕遭遇区的任何明显特征。标准的逃生路径，如后门和已知的下水道入口将被关注，人物以前使用过的战术也将被了解。只有特殊的逃跑路线--例如只有宫殿里最信任的仆人知道的秘密通道--才会让邪教分子和红袍巫师感到惊讶。",
	"Because clever ruses and ambush have failed in previous attacks, the cult's third assault opts for overwhelming force. The dragons attack the characters from the air, attempting to draw them outside if they are indoors. When they finally face off against the adventurers, the attackers fight to kill. If the characters try to stay inside and under cover, the dragons attack whatever building they hide in, setting it ablaze. Half-dragons, cultists, and mages watch all known exits, including underground ones, to prevent the characters from slipping away.": "由于之前的攻击中巧妙的诡计和埋伏都失败了，邪教的第三次攻击选择了压倒性的力量。龙从空中攻击人物，如果他们在室内，则试图将他们引到室外。当他们最终与冒险家们对峙时，攻击者们就会拼命杀人。如果人物试图呆在室内和掩护下，龙就会攻击他们所躲藏的建筑物，将其烧毁。半龙人、邪教徒和法师监视着所有已知的出口，包括地下的出口，以防止人物溜走。",
	"This battle will likely be a challenge to run. It is designed to create an emotional low spot in the adventure, during which overall defeat for the forces of good looks like a real possibility. Character death—even if temporary—can crush some players' spirits.": "这场战斗很可能是一个挑战。它的目的是在冒险中创造一个情感的低点，在这个过程中，善的力量的整体失败看起来是真实的可能性。角色的死亡--即使是暂时的--也会压垮一些玩家的精神。",
	"For those players, don't make this battle just a relentless slog toward death. Give the adventurers opportunities to save innocent townsfolk from being slaughtered and turn dragons away from fleeing crowds. The characters can clear burning buildings, use magic to douse flames or save the dying, and stand up for those who cannot defend themselves. Let their sacrifice during this fight mean something.": "对于这些玩家来说，不要让这场战斗只是无情地走向死亡。让冒险者有机会拯救无辜的镇民，使他们免于被屠杀，让龙远离逃亡的人群。角色们可以清理燃烧的建筑物，使用魔法浇灭火焰或拯救垂死的人，并为那些无法自卫的人站出来。让他们在这场战斗中的牺牲意味着什么。",
	"Great heroes rebound from losses to fight even harder for the cause they believe in. Thanks to {@spell raise dead}, a lost battle is a setback, not a defeat. It's a wake-up call to any players who assumed that the characters' victory was assured. The Cult of the Dragon is committed to its goal and will stop at nothing to achieve it. The characters must be even more committed to theirs.": "伟大的英雄们从失败中反弹，为他们所相信的事业更加努力地战斗。由于{@spell raise dead}，一场失败的战斗是一种挫折，而不是失败。这对任何认为角色的胜利已经得到保证的玩家来说是一个警钟。神龙教致力于其目标，并将不惜一切代价来实现它。角色们必须对自己的目标更加坚定。",
	"Depending on how the adventure unfolds, feel free to alter the forces and tactics in the second and third attacks as you see fit. For example, you might want to hold off with the yugoloths until the third attack, or you might want Red Wizards showing up in the second attack rather than the third.": "根据冒险的发展情况，你可以随意改变第二和第三次攻击的力量和战术，因为你认为合适。例如，你可能想把尤戈洛特人推迟到第三次进攻，或者你可能想让红袍巫师在第二次进攻中出现而不是在第三次进攻中出现。",
	"One of those dragons, an ancient gold wyrm named Protanther, invoked an ancient draconic rite of council, summoning ambassadors from among the metallic dragons. Meeting in the Nether Mountains, the council will determine what metallic dragons should do in the face of the looming threat of {@creature Tiamat|RoT}.": "其中一条龙，一个名为Protanther的古老的黄金巫妖，调用了一个古老的龙族议会仪式，从金属龙中召唤出了大使们。在尼瑟山开会，议会将决定金属龙在面对迫在眉睫的{@creature Tiamat|RoT}威胁时应该做些什么。",
	"The council includes representatives from each of the five metallic dragon races, who will spread word to their fellows of the council's decision. Of specific importance to the factions of Waterdeep is the question of whether the dragons should aid the civilized humanoid races in their fight against the cult, or whether they will act on their own.": "委员会包括来自五个金属龙族的代表，他们将向他们的同伴传达委员会的决定。对于沃特德普的各个派别来说，最重要的问题是，龙族是否应该帮助文明的人形种族对抗邪教，或者它们是否会独自行动。",
	"During the council, the adventurers have a chance to engage and debate some of Faerûn's wisest and most powerful creatures. They must convince the dragons that the cause of the humanoid folk of the Sword Coast is just, and that dragons and non-dragons need to support each other in this conflict.": "在议会期间，冒险者们有机会与法鲁恩最睿智、最强大的生物进行交流和辩论。他们必须说服龙，让他们相信剑海岸的人形生物的事业是公正的，而且龙和非龙需要在这场冲突中相互支持。",
	"To broker such an alliance, the characters might need to promise concessions on behalf of different factions—whether they have those factions' permission to offer concessions or not. If they are successful, the adventurers can gain not only the support of the dragons as a whole but also the specific favor of certain councilors, including valuable magic items from those dragons' own hoards.": "为了促成这样的联盟，人物可能需要代表不同的派别承诺让步--无论他们是否得到这些派别的许可，都要提供让步。如果他们成功了，冒险家们不仅可以获得整个龙族的支持，还可以获得某些议员的特别青睐，包括来自这些龙族自己囤积的宝贵魔法物品。",
	"By ancient tradition, the draconic council includes ambassadors from the diminutive humanoid races. The silver dragon Otaaryliakkarnos—in the guise of the human Elia—comes to the Council of Waterdeep to extend the invitation to the draconic council, at which point, the delegates discuss who should be sent as ambassadors for the humanoid factions of the Sword Coast. As a group not aligned overall with any specific faction or cause, the party is deemed to be the best fit.": "根据古老的传统，龙人议会包括来自矮小的人形种族的大使。银龙奥塔利亚卡诺斯（Otaaryliakkarnos）以人类伊利亚的身份来到沃特德普议会，向龙人议会发出邀请，这时，代表们讨论应该派谁作为剑海岸人形派系的大使。作为一个整体上不与任何特定派别或事业结盟的团体，该党被认为是最合适的。",
	"The journey from Waterdeep to the Nether Mountains is more than six hundred miles. Otaaryliakkarnos is willing to grant the characters the special boon of flying them there on her back in only two days. However, this offer is extended only if the adventurers leave directly from the council, rather than first pursuing any other business.": "从Waterdeep到Nether Mountains的旅程超过了六百英里。Otaaryliakkarnos愿意给予人物特殊的恩惠，让他们在她的背上飞到那里，只需两天时间。然而，只有在冒险者直接从议会出发，而不是先去做其他事情的情况下，才会提供这一优惠。",
	"The journey takes the characters through areas suffering under the cult's attacks. Whether from horseback or by air, they see the ruins of isolated settlements and smoke hanging on the horizon. If the characters travel overland, they might pass through some of these ruined settlements, or encounter cult marauders, brigands, refugees, and chromatic dragons bent on destruction. Use your own discretion when choosing how many combat encounters the journey should encompass.": "旅程中，人物穿越了遭受邪教攻击的地区。无论是骑马还是乘飞机，他们都会看到孤立的定居点的废墟和地平线上的烟雾。如果人物走陆路，他们可能会经过一些废墟上的定居点，或者遇到邪教掠夺者、强盗、难民和一心想要毁灭的色龙。在选择旅程中应包括多少次战斗遭遇时，请自行斟酌。",
	"Five ancient dragons make up the council charged with deciding their metallic kin's response to the cult. Though they are not necessarily the wisest or most powerful specimens of dragonkind, all are well respected. Any decision made by these dragon councilors will be accepted by the metallic dragons as a whole.": "五条古龙组成了委员会，负责决定他们的金属亲属对邪教的反应。虽然他们不一定是龙族中最聪明或最强大的标本，但都很受尊重。这些龙族理事做出的任何决定都将被整个金属龙族所接受。",
	"Each dragon councilor has one of four attitudes in this chapter, ranging from {@b unfriendly} to {@b cautious}, {@b neutral}, and {@b friendly}. To secure the cooperation of the metallic dragons as a whole, the party must conclude this chapter with at least three dragon councilors having a friendly attitude and with none unfriendly. If the characters make a promise or perform an act aimed at a specific dragon, they gain a two-step improvement in the attitude of that dragon (for example, from unfriendly to neutral, or from cautious to friendly). A general concession grants a one-step improvement to a single dragon of your choosing.": "每位龙族议员在本章中都有四种态度之一，从{@b unfriendly}到{@b cautious}、{@b neutral}和{@b friendly}。为了确保整个金属龙的合作，在本章结束时，一方必须至少有三个龙族议员持友好态度，没有一个持不友好态度。如果人物做出承诺或做出针对特定龙的行为，他们会在该龙的态度上获得两步的改善（例如，从不友好到中立，或从谨慎到友好）。一般性的让步可以使你选择的一条龙获得一步的改善。",
	"Metallic dragons are exceedingly wise, but they sometimes have difficulty distinguishing individual humanoids from each other. As such, an individual dragon's initial attitude depends on the party's racial makeup—and on ancient interactions and past wrongs.": "金属龙是非常聪明的，但它们有时很难将单个人类区分开来。因此，个别龙的最初态度取决于当事人的种族构成--以及古代的互动和过去的错误。",
		"Protanther is the leader of the council. A former King of Justice—a royal title among the gold dragons—he does not care for humanoids, particularly humans and elves. Though he sees both good and bad in the lesser races, he believes that their capacity for attaining great power despite their physical limitations makes them dangerous. For all their capability, humanoids have little time to learn the wisdom to direct that capability.": "普罗坦瑟是议会的领袖。他曾是正义之王--一个金龙的皇家头衔，他不关心人类，尤其是人类和精灵。虽然他认为较小的种族有好有坏，但他认为，尽管他们的身体有局限性，但他们获得巨大力量的能力使他们变得危险。对于他们的能力，人类几乎没有时间去学习指导这种能力的智慧。",
	"Protanther can at least appreciate that the crimes of the humanoid races are usually directed against each other. He knows that the short lives of many humanoids means they might not even recognize their own evil. The elves, however, live for long years and possess great knowledge—and have used that knowledge to the detriment of dragonkind in the past. It was the elves who shaped the magic of the {@i Dracorage mythal}, causing dragons across Faerûn to go mad with rage. Convincing Protanther to trust humanoid factions that include elves is a difficult task.": "Protanther至少可以理解，人形种族的罪行通常是针对彼此的。他知道许多类人族的短暂生命意味着他们甚至可能认识不到自己的邪恶。然而，精灵们活了很久，拥有丰富的知识--并且在过去利用这些知识对龙族造成了伤害。正是精灵们塑造了{@i Dracorage mythal}的魔法，导致整个法鲁恩的龙因愤怒而发狂。说服普罗坦斯信任包括精灵在内的人形派别是一项艰难的任务。",
	"Protanther would prefer that the dragons rally their forces with no regard for the humanoid factions, striking immediately and decisively before the cult and its chromatic dragon allies can muster their full strength. If this puts the humanoids at risk, so be it.": "普罗坦斯更希望龙族集结力量时不考虑人形派别，在邪教及其色龙盟友能够集结全部力量之前，立即果断地进行打击。如果这让人形生物处于危险之中，那就这样吧。",
	"Neutral. If there are humans or tieflings in the party, Protanther is instead cautious. If there are elves in the party, he is unfriendly.": "中性。如果党内有人类或铁弗林，普罗坦斯反而会很谨慎。如果党内有精灵，他就不太友好。",
	"Protanther wants a formal apology from one who speaks for elvenkind for the abomination that was the {@i Dracorage mythal}. He is willing to trust that the adventurers can wring such an apology from King Melandrach on the council.": "普罗坦斯希望代表精灵族的人对{@i Dracorage mythal}的可恶行为进行正式道歉。他愿意相信冒险者们能从议会的梅兰德斯国王那里获得这样的道歉。",
	"Ileuthra is an ancient brass dragon who travels the planes in search of knowledge and ever more challenging games. Legend has it that he resides with Oghma, god of knowledge, but the dragon is cagey on that point.": "Ileuthra是一条古老的铜龙，他在各个星球上旅行，寻找知识和更有挑战性的游戏。传说中，他与知识之神奥格玛住在一起，但龙在这一点上很狡猾。",
	"Seeing good and bad in equal measure among the lesser races, Ileuthra recognizes that helping the humanoids is less a case of deciding whether they are worthy of aid, and more about deciding whether these adventurer ambassadors can be trusted to properly lead the factions.": "在较小的种族中看到好的和坏的并存，Ileuthra认识到，帮助人族与其说是决定他们是否值得援助，不如说是决定这些冒险家大使是否可以被信任来正确领导各派。",
	"Ileuthra has no preconceived sense of what might be the best course, and he is willing to hear all sides of the discussion.": "Ileuthra对什么可能是最佳方案没有先入为主的感觉，他愿意听取各方的讨论。",
	"Neutral. Ileuthra has watched the lesser races for long centuries from the planes, and he understands that every individual humanoid possesses the potential for good or evil in equal measure. He is truly undecided, and will weigh all options for action against the cult.": "中性。Ileuthra已经在各个星球上观察了较小的种族长达几个世纪之久，他明白每一个人形生物都拥有同等程度的善与恶的潜力。他确实没有决定权，并将权衡所有针对邪教的行动选项。",
	"Ileuthra believes that the dragon masks are too dangerous to remain in the worldin the world if the humanoid races are aware of where they are. If the characters agree that all dragon masks will be handed over to the metallic dragons as soon as they are found—including any masks captured after the final battle—his attitude can be improved.": "Ileuthra认为，如果人形种族知道龙面具的位置，那么龙面具留在这个世界上就太危险了。如果角色们同意，所有的龙面具一旦被发现就会被移交给金属龙--包括最后一战后捕获的任何龙面具--他的态度就能得到改善。",
	"The representative of the silver dragons believes that among the lesser races, neither good nor bad is ever absolute. The humanoids are in need of protection and guidance, and should be shown Bahamut's righteous way of living rather than ignored and treated as children. If the dragons refuse to engage the humanoids and focus only on their own advancement, the humanoids will persist in making the same mistakes again and again.": "银龙的代表认为，在较小的种族中，好与坏都不是绝对的。人族需要保护和指导，应该向巴哈姆特展示正义的生活方式，而不是被忽视和当作孩子对待。如果龙族拒绝与人族接触，只关注自己的进步，人族就会坚持一次又一次地犯同样的错误。",
	"Otaaryliakkarnos's faith in the potential of humanoids has something of a blind spot when it comes to dwarves, however. She resents the dwarves for their Dragonmoots of old—great hunts during which clans would come together to end the perceived threat of a particular dragon. Centuries before, Otaaryliakkarnos's niece was killed in a Dragonmoot, and with the long ancestral memory of the metallic dragons, she holds all dwarves responsible.": "然而，当涉及到矮人时，奥塔利雅克-卡诺斯对人的潜力的信心却有一些盲点。她憎恨矮人，因为他们有古老的Dragonmoots--伟大的狩猎活动，在这些活动中，各族会聚集在一起，以结束对某条龙的威胁。几个世纪以前，奥塔利雅克-卡诺斯的侄女在一次 \"龙啸 \"中丧生，由于对金属龙有着悠久的祖先记忆，她认为所有的矮人都有责任。",
	"Neutral. If the party includes one or more dwarves, Otaaryliakkarnos is instead unfriendly.": "中立。如果队伍中包括一个或多个矮人，奥塔里亚克卡诺斯反而不友好。",
	"Otaaryliakkarnos would like the metallic dragons to strike now as Protanther suggests, but she does not know if they can succeed alone. An alliance would reduce casualties for all parties, but the dragons must be certain of the intentions of the factions and their leaders.": "Otaaryliakkarnos希望金属龙现在就像Protanther建议的那样出击，但她不知道他们是否能单独成功。一个联盟将减少各方的伤亡，但龙必须确定各派别及其领导人的意图。",
	"Otaaryliakkarnos knows that the skin of her slain kin was used to make armor for the dwarf lord who slew her. She demands the remains be returned and that Ambassador Brawnanvil make an apology on behalf of all dwarves for the wrongful deaths the Dragonmoots have caused.": "Otaaryliakkarnos知道，她被杀的亲属的皮肤被用来为杀害她的矮人领主制作盔甲。她要求归还遗体，并要求布劳南威尔大使代表所有矮人为 \"龙魔 \"造成的错误死亡道歉。",
	"Of all the dragons on the council, Nymmurh disagrees most strongly with Protanther. He knows that the metallic dragons are made in the image of Bahamut, and have no choice in the matter of being good or evil. Thus, how much greater and more precious is good when it is freely chosen by the humanoids, who must consciously turn away from villainy?": "在议会的所有龙中，尼莫尔最不同意普罗坦斯的观点。他知道，金属龙是按照巴哈姆特的形象制造的，在善恶问题上没有选择。因此，如果善是由人族自由选择的，他们必须有意识地远离恶行，那么善是多么伟大和珍贵？",
	"Nymmurh would like to help the factions, looking to the Harpers and the Order of the Gauntlet as epitomizing the best traits of humanoid aspiration.": "尼莫尔愿意帮助各派别，他认为哈珀斯和高塔骑士团是人族愿望的最佳特质的缩影。",
	"Unless the party has engaged in problematic behavior in his presence (or where he would hear of it), Nymmurh is friendly. He knows that the characters come to the council on the recommendation of those he respects and loves.": "除非当事人在他面前有问题的行为（或他会听到的地方），否则尼穆尔是友好的。他知道这些人物是在他所尊敬和爱戴的人的推荐下来到议会的。",
	"Nymmurh needs no concession unless the characters have somehow offended him. In such a scenario, the adventurers must prove their worth and goodness in a way you deem suitable.": "除非人物以某种方式冒犯了他，否则Nymmurh不需要让步。在这种情况下，冒险者必须以你认为合适的方式证明他们的价值和善良。",
	"Tazmikella is fond of humans and has spent a great deal of time living among them, but she has reservations about supporting the factions. Her lair and hoard have been the target of cunning thieves and fast-talking swindlers more than once, and she perceives betrayal as a humanoid trait. She fears what might happen if one or more factions turn against the metallic dragons to demonstrate loyalty to {@creature Tiamat|RoT}.": "塔兹米凯拉喜欢人类，并花了大量时间生活在他们中间，但她对支持各派别有保留。她的巢穴和囤积物已经不止一次成为狡猾的小偷和快嘴骗子的目标，她认为背叛是人类的特征。她担心如果一个或多个派别为了显示对{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的忠诚而背叛金属龙会发生什么。",
	"The copper dragon also believes that unrestricted interaction between humanoids and dragons has been disastrous for both races. The {@i Dracorage mythal} serves as a sore reminder of the animosity that has often arisen between the two peoples.": "铜龙还认为，人类和龙之间不受限制的互动对两个种族都是灾难性的。{@i Dracorage mythal}是对两个民族之间经常出现的敌意的一个痛心提醒。",
	"Tazmikella agrees with Protanther that the metallic dragons could strike against the chromatic dragons themselves. However, she is not convinced they would succeed, and having humanoid allies would reduce casualties for both sides.": "塔兹米凯拉同意普罗坦瑟的观点，即金属龙可以自己对色龙进行攻击。然而，她不相信他们会成功，而且有类人的盟友会减少双方的伤亡。",
	"Neutral. If any character is a dragonborn, Tazmikella is instead cautious. If the party contains any character with a personal reputation for shady dealings (particularly a rogue or bard), she is unfriendly.": "中性。如果任何角色是龙裔，塔兹米凯拉反而会很谨慎。如果队伍中包含任何有个人声誉的阴暗交易的角色（尤其是流氓或吟游诗人），她就不友好了。",
	"Pick one magic item owned by a member of the party, and which was found during a previous adventure. That item turns out to have once belonged to Tazmikella, and was part of a hoard she took from an ancient black dragon she defeated. ({@spell Legend lore} or similar magic used on the item confirms this story.) The item holds sentimental value to her—or it did until a thief stole it from her hoard. Returning the item to her with an apology improves Tazmikella's attitude.": "挑选一件党员拥有的魔法物品，而且是在以前的冒险中发现的。那件物品原来曾经属于塔兹米凯拉，是她从一条被她打败的古老黑龙那里得到的囤积物的一部分。({@spell Legend lore}或对该物品使用的类似魔法证实了这个故事。) 这件物品对她来说具有感情上的价值--或者说，在一个小偷从她的囤积物中偷走它之前，它是如此。把物品还给她并表示歉意可以改善塔兹米凯拉的态度。",
	"The party can make general concessions to the dragons to appease them as a group, rather than make personal concessions to individual dragons. A general concession improves the attitude of a single dragon of your choice by one step.": "党派可以对龙做出一般的让步，以安抚它们作为一个团体，而不是对个别龙做出个人让步。一般性让步可以使你选择的一条龙的态度提高一步。",
	"The attitude of the dragons is improved by wealth in the following order: Tazmikella, Otaaryliakkarnos, Ileuthra, Protanther, and Nymmurh. Promising one-third (five shares among fifteen factions) or more of the treasure improves the attitude of all five dragons.": "龙的态度因财富而改善，其顺序如下。塔兹米凯拉（Tazmikella）、奥塔里亚克卡诺斯（Otaaryliakkarnos）、伊留特拉（Ileuthra）、普罗坦瑟（Protanther）和尼穆尔（Nymmurh）。承诺三分之一（十五个派别中的五份）或更多的财宝可以改善所有五条龙的态度。",
	"The dragons do not prompt the party with options, but the characters can potentially sway them with other offers. Reward player ingenuity for options such as the following:": "龙并没有向当事人提示选择，但人物有可能用其他提议来动摇他们。奖励玩家的聪明才智，比如说以下的选择。",
	"Promise to turn over {@creature Severin|RoT} as a prisoner if captured, or to deliver his body to the dragons if slain": "承诺如果被俘，将交出{@creature Severin|RoT}作为俘虏，如果被杀，则将其尸体交给龙。",
	"Consecrating a major monastery or temple to Bahamut": "将一座重要的寺院或庙宇献给巴哈姆特",

	"When the characters have reached a satisfactory agreement with the dragons, Otaaryliakkarnos offers to return to Waterdeep to let the council know an agreement has been reached. The details and terms—including any concessions promised by the characters—can be discussed during the next council session.

	"Two of the leading dracolich traditionalists—a dragonsoul named Jorgen Pawl and his trusted lieutenant {@creature Iskander|RoT}—have been most vocal in their objections. As the time of the summoning ritual approaches, {@creature Severin|RoT} understands that he can't risk losing loyal troops to infighting and insurrection. He has thus agreed to give Jorgen Pawl and his followers a dragon mask to examine, allowing them to determine whether {@creature Severin|RoT}'s understanding of the masks' power is correct. If {@creature Severin|RoT} is wrong, he will know before risking everything on a do-or-die gamble. If he is right, the traditionalists will give their support to {@creature Severin|RoT}'s plans.": "两个主要的龙族传统主义者--一个叫约根-波尔的龙魂和他信任的副官{@creature Iskander|RoT}--一直是最强烈的反对意见。随着召唤仪式时间的临近，{@creature Severin|RoT}明白他不能冒因内讧和叛乱而失去忠诚部队的风险。因此，他同意给约根-波尔和他的追随者一个龙形面具来检查，让他们来确定{@creature Severin|RoT}对面具力量的理解是否正确。如果{@creature Severin|RoT}是错的，他就会在把一切都押在一场不死不休的赌局上之前知道。如果他是对的，传统主义者会支持{@creature Severin|RoT}的计划。",
	"What Jorgen does not know is that {@creature Severin|RoT} asked his {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} allies to create a false mask, supplying the scholar with a duplicate of the {@item Blue Dragon Mask|RoTOS} that appears both powerful and inscrutable, though it holds little in the way of real magic. {@creature Severin|RoT} knows the scholars will discover the deception eventually, but he hopes that the false mask will keep the traditionalists occupied while he completes his plans.": "约根不知道的是，{@creature Severin|RoT}让他的{@creature Red Wizard|RoT}盟友制造了一个假面具，给学者提供了一个{@item Blue Dragon Mask|RoTOS}的复制品，看起来既强大又难以捉摸，尽管它没有什么真正的魔法。{@creature Severin|RoT}知道学者们最终会发现这个骗局，但他希望在他完成计划的时候，这个假面具能让传统主义者忙得团团转。",
	"{@creature Iskander|RoT}'s message to the party can arrive in any manner you see fit, including through contacts in the Zhentarim. Whether it comes directly to the characters or to an NPC on the Council of Waterdeep, the message could be a hastily scribbled note, an eloquent appeal delivered by bonded messenger, or a whispered plea in a dark corridor.": "{@creature Iskander|RoT}给队伍的信息可以以你认为合适的方式到达，包括通过Zhentarim的联系人。不管是直接传给人物还是传给沃特德普议会的NPC，信息可以是一张匆忙写下的纸条，也可以是由保税信使发出的雄辩的呼吁，或者是在黑暗的走廊里低声的哀求。",

	"Xonthal's Tower is legendary among the wizards and tale-spinners of Faerûn for its unusual magical defenses, including a magical hedge maze that surrounds it. The cultists avoid the hedge maze by accessing a portal inside the tower that they use to travel in and out.": "Xonthal's Tower在Faerûn的巫师和传说家中是个传奇，因为它有不寻常的魔法防御，包括一个环绕它的魔法树篱迷宫。邪教徒们通过进入塔内的一个传送门来避开篱笆迷宫，他们用这个传送门来进出。",
	"The wizard Xonthal was an extraordinary figure. Beginning as a lowly adventurer, he traveled across Faerûn and beyond, reaching distant Zakhara, Kara-Tur, and even Maztica. His work focused on conjuration and elemental evocation, so he often kept elementals and genies for company.": "巫师Xonthal是一个非凡的人物。从一个卑微的冒险家开始，他走遍了法鲁恩和其他地方，到达了遥远的扎哈拉、卡拉图尔，甚至是马兹提卡。他的工作重点是施展魔法和元素召唤，所以他经常与元素和精灵为伴。",
	"Xonthal prized solitude, so he designed his tower and its surrounding hedge maze to deter intruders and unwanted visitors. Over a century ago, the wizard kicked his apprentices out and sealed the tower. No one knows what Xonthal has been up to in the intervening decades, or whether he's even still alive. Some think he must have become a lich, while others believe he's just dead. All that's certain is that the hedge maze remains a frustrating barrier, and the spells and wards protecting the tower against entry remain as powerful as ever.": "Xonthal珍视孤独，所以他设计了他的塔和周围的树篱迷宫，以阻止入侵者和不受欢迎的访客。一个多世纪以前，这位巫师把他的学徒们赶了出去，并封存了这座塔。没有人知道Xonthal在这几十年里做了什么，或者他是否还活着。有些人认为他一定是变成了一个巫师，而其他人则认为他只是死了。所有可以确定的是，树篱迷宫仍然是一个令人沮丧的障碍，保护塔的法术和防护装置仍然像以前一样强大。",
	"Spreading out along the edge of the hedge maze is a village, also called Xonthal's Tower. The settlement began as a place where Xonthal's many apprentices established homes of their own. As years passed, more settlers were drawn to the area as word spread that the wizard and his apprentices offered excellent protection against marauding orcs and monsters. The village is smaller now than in the tower's heyday, but about three hundred people still live there.": "沿着树篱迷宫的边缘蔓延开来的是一个村庄，也叫Xonthal的塔。这个定居点最初是Xonthal的许多学徒建立自己的家的地方。随着时间的推移，更多的定居者被吸引到这个地区，因为有消息说，巫师和他的学徒们提供了很好的保护，可以抵御兽人和怪物的掠夺。现在的村庄比塔的全盛时期要小，但仍有大约三百人住在那里。",
	"The locals are friendly enough, but they're wary of strangers who ask too many questions about the tower. Things were quiet there for a long time, but for almost a year now, the villagers have seen lights through the windows at night and heard unearthly sounds. A few claim to have seen a blue dragon lingering in the sky high above. Some villagers scoff at that idea, but everyone agrees that the tower has been reoccupied.": "当地人足够友好，但他们对那些问太多关于塔的问题的陌生人很警惕。那里的事情平静了很久，但近一年来，村民们在晚上看到了透过窗户的灯光，并听到了非人的声音。有几个人声称看到一条蓝龙在高高的天空中徘徊。一些村民对这一想法嗤之以鼻，但大家都认为塔已经被重新占领了。",
	"Once the villagers are satisfied that the adventurers haven't come to lay waste to the tower (fearing that an all-out battle would likely destroy the village too), they're interested in talking of little else besides who could be inside. The most popular theories are that Xonthal has returned or has awakened as a lich, or that one of the genies and elementals he once imprisoned finally broke free of its restraints but remains trapped inside the tower.": "一旦村民们确信冒险家们不是来浪费塔的（担心一场全面的战斗很可能也会摧毁村庄），他们就会有兴趣谈论除了谁可能在里面之外的其他事情。最流行的理论是，Xonthal已经回来了，或者已经觉醒为一个巫师，或者他曾经囚禁的某个精灵和元素最终挣脱了束缚，但仍然被困在塔里。",
	"The villagers warn the characters sternly about the danger of entering the maze. Few who enter it ever come back out, and those who do come out are much worse for wear. Even animals and birds avoid the maze.": "村民们严厉地警告这些人物进入迷宫的危险。进入迷宫的人很少有机会出来，而那些出来的人则更惨。甚至连动物和鸟类都避开了迷宫。",
	"The hedge maze surrounding the central tower is an astounding work of magical construction. In certain regards, it's even more impressive than the tower because of the powerful ways it manipulates space.": "围绕中央塔楼的篱笆迷宫是一个令人震惊的魔法建筑作品。在某些方面，它甚至比塔楼更令人印象深刻，因为它以强大的方式操纵着空间。",
	"A gently curving path leads into the maze from the edge of the village. The villagers built a low fence across the entrance to keep young children and animals from wandering in. Fear of the maze is hammered into all other residents of the village from the time they're old enough to appreciate its dangers, and they shun it diligently.": "一条缓缓弯曲的小路从村子的边缘通向迷宫。村民们在入口处建了一道低矮的栅栏，以防止年幼的孩子和动物误入其中。村子里的其他居民从长大到能体会到迷宫的危险时，就对迷宫产生了恐惧，他们也会努力避开它。",
	"Seen from above—either by a flying character or from nearby rooftops—the maze appears to be an overgrown, tangled mess with no discernible paths longer than a dozen yards. It looks exactly like what it is: a hedge maze left untended for more than a century, grown into a nearly solid mass of hedge and thorn.": "从上面看--无论是从飞行角色还是从附近的屋顶--迷宫似乎是一个杂草丛生、纠缠不清的烂摊子，没有超过十几码的可辨认的路径。它看起来就像它是什么：一个被遗弃了一个多世纪的树篱迷宫，成长为一个几乎由树篱和荆棘组成的固体。",
	"Seen from ground level, however, the maze appears to be a pleasant, hedge-ringed garden with no resemblance to a maze at all. Villagers are quick to point out this anomaly, to prove to the characters that the maze is nothing to take lightly. The view from above reveals the maze as it exists in the real world. The view up the path from ground level looks into the extradimensional space that Xonthal crafted as a barrier around his home.": "然而，从地面上看，迷宫似乎是一个令人愉快的、有树篱环绕的花园，与迷宫一点也不相像。村民们很快就指出了这一反常现象，以向人物证明迷宫是不可轻视的。从上面看，迷宫就像它在现实世界中存在的那样。从地面往上看，可以看到Xonthal在他家周围制作的作为屏障的超维空间。",
	"The tower's entrance exists only within this extradimensional space. Entering the maze any other way than walking up the main path quickly leads characters into densely tangled brush that is all but impassable, and that doesn't physically connect to any tower entrance. Characters who cut their way through to the tower, fly across to it, or tunnel beneath the maze to the outside wall find only smooth, unbroken stone that cannot be breached or bypassed by any means. A balcony juts out from the top level of the tower, but it is surrounded by an invisible, impenetrable barrier that deflects all objects and effects. The only way to reach the tower's entrance is through Xonthal's extradimensional maze.": "塔的入口只存在于这个超维空间中。除了走上主路之外，以任何其他方式进入迷宫都会很快将角色带入密密麻麻的灌木丛中，这些灌木丛几乎无法通行，而且在物理上并不与任何塔的入口相连。角色们通过切入塔楼的方式，飞过塔楼，或者在迷宫下面的隧道里找到外墙，却发现只有光滑的、没有破损的石头，无法通过任何手段突破或绕过。一个阳台从塔的顶层伸出来，但它被一个无形的、不可逾越的障碍物所包围，使所有的物体和影响发生偏转。到达塔的入口的唯一方法是通过Xonthal的次元迷宫。",
	"Because the maze doesn't exist in normal space, it cannot be traditionally mapped. Instead, it is shown here as a set of seven nodes where encounters occur. Moving between two nodes takes {@dice 2d6} rounds regardless of whether characters walk or run. Characters experience such movement as if walking down a well-groomed path in a hedge garden. The path curves so that characters can't see more than 15 feet ahead, exactly as if they were in a circular garden with concentric paths. Cutting through hedges has no effect on how long it takes characters to get from one node to the next. Characters who return to look for a spot previously cut through will never find it.": "由于迷宫不存在于正常的空间中，所以它不能被传统地映射出来。取而代之的是，它在这里被显示为一组七个节点，这些节点会发生遭遇战。在两个节点之间移动需要{@dice 2d6}个回合，不管角色是走还是跑。角色体验这样的运动，就像走在篱笆花园里一条修剪整齐的小路上。路径弯曲，使角色无法看到前方超过15英尺的地方，完全就像他们在一个有同心小径的圆形花园里一样。穿过树篱对人物从一个节点到下一个节点所需的时间没有影响。角色如果返回去寻找之前被切开的地方，将永远找不到它。",
	"The hedge walls are 8 feet tall, allowing the adventurers to see the tower above them from many locations. This view provides no clue to direction, however. Characters who see the tower to the left one moment might spot it to the right, or behind, or closer or farther away a moment later. When trying to focus on the tower's new location, characters suddenly find that they can't remember its old location clearly, or begin to wonder if it was in its current spot all along.": "篱笆墙有8英尺高，使冒险者可以从许多地方看到他们头上的塔。然而，这种视野并没有提供方向的线索。一会儿看到左边的塔，一会儿看到右边的，一会儿看到后面的，一会儿看到更近的、更远的。当试图把注意力集中在塔的新位置时，人物突然发现他们不能清楚地记得它的旧位置，或者开始怀疑它是否一直在现在的位置上。",
	"If a character who entered the extradimensional maze along the path tries to fly above it once inside, the tower immediately fades from view, and the view becomes endless hedge-lined paths stretching to the horizon in every direction. Alternatively, characters who fly above the maze are shunted back into the real world, emerging above the hedge tangle with their companions nowhere in sight. The only way for them to rejoin the party is to enter the maze again and retrace their steps, dealing with all encounters along the way. (Use this option carefully if you're not a fan of splitting the party.)": "如果一个沿着路径进入超时空迷宫的角色在进入迷宫后试图飞到它上面，塔就会立即从视野中消失，而视野则变成了无尽的树篱小径，从各个方向延伸到地平线。另外，飞到迷宫上方的人物会被分流回现实世界，出现在树篱纠结的上方，而他们的同伴却不见踪影。他们重新加入队伍的唯一方法是再次进入迷宫，重新走一遍，处理沿途的所有遭遇。(如果你不喜欢分头行动，请谨慎使用这个选项）。",
	"If the characters enter the maze at night, starlight from a clear sky is bright enough for them to find their way through—and even bright enough for the sundial in {@area area 1|19c|x} to cast a shadow. However, anyone with a passing familiarity of the sky notices that the constellations are completelyunfamiliar.": "如果人物在晚上进入迷宫，来自晴朗天空的星光足以让他们找到通过的方法--甚至足以让{@area area 1|19c|x}的日晷投下阴影。然而，任何对天空稍有了解的人都会注意到，这些星座是完全不熟悉的。",
	"Area 1 is the heart of the maze, and characters will return there many times as they seek the entrance to the tower. If they do things correctly, they won't need to face any of the maze's dangers. That's unlikely, though.": "区域1是迷宫的中心，人物在寻找塔的入口时将多次回到那里。如果他们做得正确，他们将不需要面对迷宫中的任何危险。但这是不可能的。",
	"Although the maze is devilishly hard to get through, it's easy to leave. All the characters need to do is express a desire to leave the maze while they're in area 1, and whatever route they take next leads them back to the entrance and the path at the edge of the village. They can turn around and come back in again, and they'll wind up in area 1, at the start of the maze.": "虽然这个迷宫非常难通过，但要离开却很容易。角色们只需要在1号区域内表达离开迷宫的愿望，无论他们接下来走什么路线，都会把他们带回入口和村子边缘的小路。他们可以转身再回来，然后他们就会回到迷宫的起点--1号区域。",
	"As the characters prepare to enter the maze for the first time, or if they are spending too long in the village, read or paraphrase the following.": "当人物准备第一次进入迷宫时，或者如果他们在村子里呆的时间太长，读一下或转述一下以下内容。",
	"As you prepare to step onto the garden path, you notice movement high up on the tower. A human male dressed in black robes stands on the balcony, waving something over his head. It's hard to make out details from this distance, but it might be a blue mask.": "当你准备踏上花园小路时，你注意到塔楼上的动静。一个身穿黑色长袍的男性人类站在阳台上，在头上挥舞着什么。从这个距离看很难看出细节，但它可能是一个蓝色的面具。",
	"\"Heroes,\" the figure screams, \"they saw you in the village! I've taken the mask, but they'll realize it's missing within minutes! Look for me beneath the tower, for it's the only place I have a chance to hide. This is the key that will let you teleport into the dungeon.\" As he speaks, the figure holds aloft a second item—some sort of white, glimmering hourglass. \"I will leave it behind after I use it, but others may find it before you do.\"": "\"英雄们，\"那个人影尖叫道，\"他们在村子里看到了你！我拿走了面具，但他们在几分钟内就会发现它不见了。我拿走了面具，但他们在几分钟内就会发现它不见了! 在塔下找我，因为这是我唯一有机会藏身的地方。这是一把钥匙，可以让你传送到地牢里。\" 在他说话的时候，这个人物高举着第二件物品--某种白色的、闪闪发光的沙漏。\"我使用后会把它留下，但其他人可能会在你之前找到它。\"",
	"The speaker looks over his shoulder as another figure suddenly dashes out onto the balcony. A flash of blades and spell-fire erupts. Then the figure who spoke pitches his attacker over the railing before dashing back inside.": "当另一个人影突然冲到阳台上时，说话者向他的肩膀看去。一阵刀光剑影和法术火焰爆发出来。然后那个说话的人把他的攻击者扔到栏杆上，然后冲回屋里。",
	"After walking up the entrance path into the maze, this is the first area the characters arrive at, entering along pathway E.": "走上进入迷宫的入口路径后，这是人物到达的第一个区域，沿着E路径进入。",
	"You've entered an intersection where eight paths converge symmetrically. You can see Xonthal's Tower dead ahead above the hedge wall, but the way the paths curve, there's no telling which one might lead to it.": "你已经进入了一个交叉口，那里有八条小路对称地汇合在一起。你可以看到Xonthal的塔就在篱笆墙的正前方，但从小路的弯曲程度来看，不知道哪条路会通向它。",
	"A sundial stands in the center of the intersection, the shadow from its gnomon pointing straight toward the tower—which is highly odd, because the sun isn't behind you. Your shadows point in the proper direction. Only the sundial's shadow points ahead.": "一个日晷矗立在十字路口的中央，其日晷的影子直指塔楼--这非常奇怪，因为太阳不在你身后。你的影子指向正确的方向。只有日晷的影子指向前方。",
	"The sundial is anchored to the ground and cannot be moved or shifted. The eight paths leading out of this area are identical. If the characters try to make any identifying marks on the ground or leave items in this area, the marks and items are gone the next time they arrive here. The adventurers shouldn't know whether they're coming back to the same spot each time or whether more than one identical sundial intersection exists in the maze.": "日晷被固定在地面上，不能被移动或移位。通往这个区域的八条路都是一样的。如果人物试图在地上做任何识别标记或在这个区域留下物品，那么在他们下次到达这里时，这些标记和物品就会消失。冒险家们不应该知道他们是否每次都会回到同一个地方，或者迷宫中是否存在不止一个相同的日晷交叉点。",
	"The sundial's shadow indicates the correct path. If the characters follow one of the paths not indicated by the sundial, it leads them to one of the other areas of the maze (your choice). There is no turning back from a wrong path. Once the last character has gone out of sight of the sundial (15 feet along the curving path), reversing direction delivers all characters to the same area they would have reached if they'd kept going forward.": "日晷的影子表示正确的路径。如果人物沿着日晷没有指示的一条路走，就会把他们带到迷宫的其他区域（你选择）。走错的路是不能回头的。一旦最后一个角色离开了日晷的视线（沿着弯曲的路径走了15英尺），扭转方向就会把所有角色带到他们如果继续向前走就会到达的相同区域。",
	"If the characters take the correct path, they return to area 1 after {@dice 2d6} rounds. Each time they return, the sundial points toward a different path, in the order presented below. However, each time the characters enter this area after the first, the gnomon casts more than one shadow. The adventurers must deduce the correct path from among multiple shadows, but those solutions aren't obvious or even fair. Xonthal was trying to keep enemies and curiosity-seekers out—not just to present them with an enjoyable mental challenge.": "如果角色走的是正确的道路，他们会在{@dice 2d6}回合后回到区域1。每次他们返回时，日晷都指向不同的路径，其顺序如下所示。然而，每次人物在第一次之后进入这个区域，日晷都会投下一个以上的阴影。冒险家们必须从多个影子中推断出正确的路径，但这些解决方案并不明显，甚至也不公平。Xonthal试图将敌人和好奇心强的人拒之门外--而不仅仅是为他们提供一个愉快的精神挑战。",
	"Sundial": "日晷",
	"Edge of hedge": "树篱的边缘",
	"The {@b first three sundials} are straightforward, even if the solutions are not always obvious.": "{@b first three sundials}是直截了当的，即使解决方案并不总是显而易见。",
	"The {@b fourth sundial} casts four shadows in an \"X\" shape. As the characters examine them, the shadows start slowly rotating around the face of the sundial, spinning faster and becoming shorter until they shrink into the gnomon and the sundial shows no shadow at all. The correct path in this case is the sundial itself. A character who jumps or climbs onto the sundial is drawn into its stone surface, then is suddenly dropped out of the sky to land harmlessly around sundial 5.": "{@b fourth sundial}投下四个 \"X \"形的影子。当人物检查它们的时候，影子开始围绕日晷的表面慢慢旋转，旋转的速度越来越快，越来越短，直到它们缩进日晷，日晷上根本没有影子。在这种情况下，正确的路径是日晷本身。跳上或爬上日晷的人物会被卷入其石面，然后突然从空中落下，无害地落在日晷5周围。",
	"The {@b fifth sundial} casts eight shadows that point at every possible pathway. No path is the right one. To correctly bisect the shadows, characters must move between the paths, straight into the end of any hedge. As soon as a character steps, runs, or dives headlong into a hedge, he or she emerges safely at the foot of the tower.": "{@b fifth sundial}投下八个影子，指向每一条可能的路径。没有一条路是正确的。为了正确地将影子一分为二，角色必须在路径之间移动，直接进入任何树篱的末端。只要一个角色迈步、奔跑或一头扎进树篱，他或她就会安全地出现在塔的脚下。",
	"Each time the characters choose a wrong path, they emerge at one of the other maze areas described below, which you can use in any order you like. If the characters make the wrong choice more than six times, you can reuse areas, create new ones of your own, or let the characters wander down a path much longer than usual before encountering the sundial again.": "每次人物选择错误的道路，他们就会出现在下面描述的其他迷宫区域之一，你可以按你喜欢的顺序使用这些区域。如果人物的错误选择超过六次，你可以重复使用这些区域，自己创造新的区域，或者让人物在再次遇到日晷之前在一条比平时更长的路上徘徊。",
	"Characters always return to the same sundial puzzle they most recently departed (sundial 1 through 5), so that they do not need to retrace their steps from the very beginning after each wrong turn. However, they have no way to tell whether they have returned to the same specific sundial, as noted above.": "角色总是回到他们最近离开的那个日晷谜题（1至5号日晷），这样他们就不需要在每次转错弯后从头开始重走一步。然而，如上所述，他们没有办法知道自己是否回到了同一个特定的日晷。",
	"Some parties are going to try splitting up in the hope of outwitting the maze. No matter how the characters attempt to do so, however, they always wind up back together. If groups take separate paths, they meet at the same destination. If one character stays at the sundial while others take a path, that path leads back to the sundial where the character is waiting. Moreover, that character swears that the others have been gone for {@dice 1d6} hours—long enough to gain the benefit of a short rest (though taking a long rest is impossible in the maze). As usual, any identifying marks made in the area vanish during those hours without anyone noticing.": "一些当事人要尝试分开，希望能智取迷宫。然而，无论这些人物如何尝试，他们最后总是会回到一起。如果各组采取不同的路径，他们会在同一个目的地相遇。如果一个角色留在日晷上，而其他人走了一条路，那条路就会回到日晷上，这个角色就在那里等着。此外，该角色发誓其他人已经离开了{@dice 1d6}小时，足以获得短暂休息的好处（尽管在迷宫中不可能长时间休息）。像往常一样，在这几个小时里，任何在该地区做的识别标记都会消失，没有人注意到。",
	"A few seconds after the first character steps onto the circle, all creatures in the circle are teleported to{@area  area 8|1b6|x}. Alternatively, the characters can walk out of the garden from the foot of the tower without any detours or difficulties. However, any gems they collected in the maze (see below) will mysteriously vanish from their possession.": "在第一个角色踏上圆圈的几秒钟后，圆圈内的所有生物都被传送到{@area  area 8|1b6|x}。另外，人物可以从塔脚下走出花园，不需要走任何弯路或困难。然而，他们在迷宫中收集的任何宝石（见下文）将从他们身上神秘地消失。",
	"Filling the center of this eighty-foot-square courtyard is a circular pool of water sixty feet across. The water is dark and murky, reducing visibility to about one foot. A garnet gemstone hovers one foot above the center of the pool. Another path leaves the area through the hedge wall on the far side of the pool, directly opposite where you entered.": "在这个八十英尺见方的院子里，有一个六十英尺宽的圆形水池，充满了中心。水是黑暗和浑浊的，能见度降低到大约一英尺。一颗石榴石宝石在水池中心上方一英尺处盘旋。另一条路通过水池远处的篱笆墙离开这里，正对着你进来的地方。",
	"Four {@creature Chuul||chuuls} dwell in this dark water. They stay hidden as long as the characters remain in the courtyard, but attack any creature that enters the pool or touches the gem. Attacking chuuls try to paralyze characters, then drag or throw them into the 50-foot-deep pool to drown them. They are fascinated by magic, though, and if any magic item is dropped into the pool, the chuuls are distracted for 5 rounds. They won't attack during that time, and if they were already attacking, they stop and dive to the bottom of the pool to inspect their new treasure.": "四个{@creature Chuul||chuuls}住在这个黑水里。只要人物还在院子里，他们就一直隐藏着，但会攻击任何进入水池或接触宝石的生物。攻击者试图麻痹角色，然后把他们拖或扔到50英尺深的水池里淹死他们。不过它们对魔法很着迷，如果有任何魔法物品掉进池子里，楚尔人就会被分散注意力，持续5个回合。在这段时间内，它们不会攻击，如果它们已经在攻击了，它们会停下来并潜入池底检查它们的新宝藏。",
	"If the characters attempt to leave the area without retrieving the garnet, both paths curve away and bring them back here after a short walk. If the characters leave any marks, items, or companions behind in this area, all the same conditions apply here as in area 1.": "如果人物试图离开这个区域而不取回石榴石，两条路都会转弯，走一段路后会回到这里。如果人物在这个区域留下了任何标记、物品或同伴，那么所有的条件都会在这里适用，就像在区域1一样。",
	"If the garnet is carried out of this area, either path leads the characters back to the sundial.": "如果石榴石被带出这个区域，无论哪条路都能让人物回到日晷上。",
	"You emerge from the path into an area far larger than any open area you expected to encounter in the maze garden. This rectangular space must be ninety feet across, with its far side almost 150 feet away. It looks like a boulder-strewn pasture, with a large pond to one side and a fenced vegetable garden and oversized cottage on the other. Sheep graze in the pasture, tended by a pair of cyclopes, but none of them are moving. They all appear frozen in time.": "你从小路走出来，进入一个远大于你预期在迷宫花园中遇到的任何开放区域。这个长方形的空间一定有九十英尺宽，它的远侧几乎有一百五十英尺远。它看起来像一个布满巨石的牧场，一边是一个大池塘，另一边是有围栏的菜园和超大的别墅。羊群在牧场上吃草，由一对独眼巨人照看，但它们都没有动。它们似乎都被冻结在时间中。",
	"As soon as any character advances into the area, the creatures here spring to life, with the sheep grazing and the cyclopes chatting idly with each other. When the cyclopes notice the characters, they exchange a few unheard words, then play some sort of game analogous to rock/paper/scissors. One loses, and both cyclopes approach the characters. They don't appear to be carrying weapons.": "只要有角色进入这个区域，这里的生物就会活跃起来，羊群在吃草，独眼巨人在闲聊。当独眼巨人注意到这些角色时，他们交换了几句没听清的话，然后玩起了类似于石头/剪子/布的某种游戏。一个人输了，两个独眼巨人就会接近这些角色。他们似乎并没有携带武器。",
	"When the cyclopes are within 20 feet of the characters, the one that lost the game scoops up a small boulder from the ground and gestures toward the party. He then looks downfield and heaves the boulder 100 feet, where it bounces and rolls another 20 feet. Both cyclopes then turn and look at the characters expectantly.": "当独眼巨人在人物的20英尺范围内时，输掉比赛的那只独眼巨人从地上捡起一块小石块，向队伍打手势。然后他往下看，将巨石抛出100英尺，在那里反弹后又滚了20英尺。然后两个独眼巨人都转过身来，满怀期待地看着这些角色。",
	"The boulders at this end of the field are all at least 2 feet in diameter and weigh 500 pounds or more.": "场地这一端的巨石都至少有2英尺的直径，重达500磅或以上。",
	"The cyclopes speak only Giant. If any character addresses them in that language, they ignore any questions but explain the rules of their game: the characters' boulder must fly farther than the cyclops's. How the characters accomplish this is unimportant to the cyclopes, but the boulder can't be dragged or carried—it must fly at least part of the distance.": "剑水蚤只会说巨人语。如果任何角色用这种语言和他们说话，他们会忽略任何问题，但会解释他们的游戏规则：角色的巨石必须比独眼巨人的飞得更远。角色如何实现这一目标对独眼巨人来说并不重要，但巨石不能被拖动或搬运，它必须至少飞过一部分距离。",
	"When the characters beat the challenge, the stone that the cyclops threw splits in half, revealing a topaz gemstone inside. If the topaz is carried out of this area, either path leads the characters back to the sundial.": "当角色们战胜挑战时，独眼巨人扔出的石头会裂成两半，露出里面的黄宝石。如果把黄宝石带出这个区域，无论哪条路都能把人物带回到日晷上。",
	"If the characters attempt to leave the area without winning the contest, both paths curve away and bring them back here after a short walk.

	"Ahead, you see a bubbling fountain filling the pathway. Large bright flowers grow in the hedges on both sides of the fountain, each blossom shimmering in the light. The air smells particularly fresh and sweet here.": "在前面，你看到一个冒着气泡的喷泉充满了小路。喷泉两边的树篱里生长着大片鲜艳的花朵，每朵花都在灯光下闪闪发光。这里的空气闻起来特别新鲜和甜美。",
	"A large flower grows on each northern and southern side of each square on the map except the square with the fountain. As the characters get closer, they can see that the shimmering of the flowers comes from a large pearl set into each one. However, if any of these carnivorous flowers is attacked, or if a character tries to remove a pearl from a flower, all twelve flowers attack any enemy they can reach. Use the statistics of an {@creature otyugh} to represent each flower, except they have speed 0, and they have the plant type.": "除了有喷泉的广场外，地图上每个广场的南北两侧各生长着一朵大花。当人物走近时，他们可以看到这些花的光泽来自于镶嵌在每朵花上的一颗大珍珠。然而，如果这些食肉花中的任何一朵被攻击，或者如果一个角色试图从一朵花上取下珍珠，所有12朵花都会攻击它们所能到达的任何敌人。用一个{@creature otyugh}的统计数据来代表每朵花，除了它们的速度为0，而且它们有植物类型。",
	"Once a flower is killed, its pearl can be removed. If a pearl is carried out of this area, either path leads the characters back to the sundial.": "一旦一朵花被杀死，它的珍珠就可以被取出。如果珍珠被带出这个区域，无论哪条路都会把人物带回到日晷。",

	"A placid pond fills the center of this open space. A stout pagoda rises from a huge boulder that stands in the water like an island. An arched bridge crosses the water to the pagoda, whose red roof is held up by six sturdy pillars and capped with carved fish. A human male wearing yellow silk robes embroidered with red and gold fish stands in the pagoda. You hear exotic music being played on a stringed instrument.": "一个平静的池塘填满了这个开放空间的中心。一座坚固的宝塔从一块巨石上升起，像一座岛屿一样矗立在水中。一座拱桥横跨水面通向宝塔，宝塔的红色屋顶由六根结实的柱子支撑，上面有雕刻的鱼。一个身穿绣有红色和金色鱼的黄色丝绸长袍的男性站在塔内。你会听到用弦乐器演奏的异国音乐。",
	"When the characters arrive, the robed figure bows to them, and sits down on the boulder where it protrudes through the floor of the pagoda. He waits patiently for the party to join him. Around the boulder, the floor of the pagoda is not wood, but rather is a rock garden of decorative stones and brushed sand. A charcoal pit smolders beside the boulder where the man sits.": "当人物到达时，长袍人向他们鞠躬，并在巨石上坐下，巨石突出于宝塔的地板。 他耐心地等待着当事人加入他。在巨石周围，宝塔的地板不是木头的，而是由装饰性石头和刷过的沙子组成的岩石花园。在那人坐着的巨石旁边，有一个炭火坑在冒烟。",
	"The master of the pagoda does not speak, and he waits as long as long as it takes for the adventurers to join him. When they enter the pagoda, he gives a brief smile and proffers silk cushions. He then waves his hand and an iron tea kettle rises up from beneath the embers. The kettle resembles a scowling face with thick features, and a character who studies it may recognize it as a dao with a successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) or Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. The man pours clear water from a clay jug into the kettle and adds tea leaves. He bows to the kettle and shows great reverence to the vessel, then lowers his head in meditation. Soon steam rises from the kettle.": "宝塔的主人没有说话，他等待的时间有多长，冒险家们就会加入他。当他们进入宝塔时，他露出一个简短的微笑，并递上丝绸坐垫。然后他一挥手，一个铁茶壶就从余烬下升了起来。这个水壶像一张皱着眉头的脸，有厚重的特征，研究它的人可以通过成功的DC12智慧（{@skill Perception}）或智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查认出它是一个道士。这个人将清水从泥壶中倒入水壶，并加入茶叶。他向水壶鞠躬，对容器表现出极大的敬意，然后低头沉思。很快，水壶里就冒出了蒸汽。",
	"With a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check, a character realizes that an innate ability lifted the teapot from the coals ({@spell move earth} acting on a small clay column). Characters who watch the leaves going into the kettle can attempt a DC 13 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) or Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check. Success indicates the character recognizes drakeswort, a potentially lethal herb.": "在成功通过DC15智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查后，角色意识到一种与生俱来的能力将茶壶从炭火中举起（{@spell move earth}作用于一个小泥柱）。看着叶子进入水壶的角色可以尝试用DC13智力（{@skill Nature}）或智慧（{@skill Medicine}）检查。成功表明该人物认出了龙葵，一种潜在的致命草药。",
	"Trapped characters have several options for escape:": "被困的人物有几种逃跑的选择。",
	"The stone walls are AC 5, 6 inches thick, and have 15 hit points per inch of thickness (90 hp total). Motivated characters can create air holes in the walls.": "石墙的AC值为5，厚度为6英寸，每英寸厚度有15点命中率（共90HP）。有动机的人物可以在墙上制造气孔。",
	"Plugging the kettle's spout or extinguishing the fire reduces the saving throw DC to 8.": "堵住水壶的出水口或熄灭火，可以将救赎的DC降低到8。",
	"A jade gemstone sits inside the teapot. If it is carried out of this area, either path leads characters back to the sundial.": "茶壶里放着一块玉石。如果把它带出这个区域，无论哪条路都能把人物带回到日晷上。",

Another pathway opens up at the far side of this area.": "六套华丽的板甲站在这个区域，仿佛在守卫。在他们面前的地毯上，散落着被打碎的盔甲和武器碎片。青苔和地衣覆盖在盔甲上，尽管它仍然没有生锈。在这个区域的远处开辟了另一条通道。",
	"When the characters begin exploring the area, two suits of {@creature animated armor} swing into motion and attack. Each time a suit of armor is destroyed, two more activate.When there are no more suits of armor to activate, the suits reassemble themselves from the components littering the ground.

This continues as long as any character remains in this area": "当人物开始探索该地区时，两套{@creature animated armor}的盔甲会摆动起来并进行攻击。每摧毁一套盔甲，就会有两套盔甲被激活。当没有更多的盔甲被激活时，盔甲会用地上的部件重新组装起来。重组需要一个装甲的全部行动--它在该回合中不能做其他事情。重组之后，动画盔甲恢复了攻击。只要有任何角色留在这个区域，这种情况就会持续下去。",

	"As they follow the path, the characters are drawn into a maze within the larger maze of the magical garden.": "当他们沿着这条路走的时候，这些人物被卷入了魔法花园这个更大的迷宫中。",
	"The curving path you follow suddenly twists to reveal a proper maze cut out of the surrounding hedges. Moments later, the pounding of hooves rings out, and a gorgon charges out of the greenery toward you.": "你所走的弯曲小路突然转弯，显示出一个从周围的树篱中切出的适当的迷宫。几分钟后，马蹄声响起，一只戈尔贡从绿色植物中冲向你。",

	"After making their way through the dangers of the hedge maze, the adventurers can enter Xonthal's Tower. Once inside, they learn that {@creature Iskander|RoT}'s fellow cultists have discovered his treason and are trying to kill him. The characters must figure out the tower's magical teleportation system, then defeat both the cultists and some of Xonthal's original defenses to rescue {@creature Iskander|RoT} and claim the dragon mask he promised them. Before the characters can leave, however, they must deal with the blue dragon summoned to protect the mask.": "在穿过树篱迷宫的危险后，冒险者们可以进入Xonthal的塔。一旦进入，他们就会发现{@creature Iskander|RoT}的同伙发现了他的叛国行为，并试图杀死他。冒险家们必须弄清楚塔内的魔法传送系统，然后击败邪教分子和Xonthal的一些原始防御措施，救出{@creature Iskander|RoT}并取得他答应给他们的龙面具。然而，在人物离开之前，他们必须对付被召唤来保护面具的蓝龙。",
	"Though the tower appears square from the outside, its chambers and walls are circular when seen from inside. This strange incongruity is another manifestation of Xonthal's ability to manipulate space.": "虽然从外面看塔是方形的，但从里面看它的房间和墙壁却是圆形的。这种奇怪的不协调性是Xonthal操纵空间能力的另一种表现形式。",
	"Chambers in the tower have 10-foot-high ceilings.": "塔内的房间有10英尺高的天花板。",
	"Areas 8 to 13 are brightly lit by narrow windows and magic lamps.": "第8至13区由窄小的窗户和魔法灯照明，光线明亮。",

The tall windows in the tower are too narrow for any creature more than a few inches wide to pass through.": "Xonthal塔的地面层没有楼梯。从一层到另一层的唯一方法是使用塔内的传送圈（地图上标有 \"T\"）。因为他们没有爬上或爬下，所以人物在传送后没有办法知道他们在哪一层，只能通过看窗外。塔里的高大窗户太窄，任何超过几英寸宽的生物都无法通过。",

	"When the characters have time to examine the skeleton (a black dragon), they can see that the bones are disconnected and placed roughly, and that the creature's forelimbs are missing.

	"Xonthal used this chamber for making observations of the starry sky. The ladder is for reaching the ceiling-mounted lens, which looks upward from the tower. Little can be seen through it during daytime, but at night, the lens gives the telescope a view of the entire sky from horizon to horizon.": "Xonthal用这个房间来观察星空。梯子是用来到达安装在天花板上的镜头的，它从塔上往上看。白天，通过它可以看到的东西很少，但在晚上，这个镜头使望远镜可以看到从地平线到地平线的整个天空。",
	"Jorgen Pawl and {@creature Iskander|RoT} share this presently empty chamber, which might have been luxurious before being subjected to the ravages of time.

	"Though the cultists have claimed the upper levels of Xonthal's Tower, they have no control over the dungeon beneath it. The secrets and ancient guardians of this area remain a mystery to them.

	"When the first two groups of cultists sent down here to explore were killed by the elementals in{@area  area 15|1c7|x}, Jorgen Pawl quickly declared the dungeon off limits. {@creature Iskander|RoT} understood the risks of fleeing here, but he knew it was the one place where Jorgen's fanatical followers would be reluctant to pursue him.": "当前两批被派到这里探索的邪教徒被{@area  area 15|1c7|x}的元素杀死后，约根-波尔迅速宣布这个地牢为禁地。{@creature Iskander|RoT}明白逃到这里的风险，但他知道这是乔根的狂热追随者不愿意追捕他的地方。",

	"{@creature Iskander|RoT} was waiting in this chamber for pursuers to appear. He killed two immediately but the third chased him into area 15, where the elementals attacked both of them.": "{@creature Iskander|RoT}在这个密室里等待着追兵的出现。他立即杀死了两个人，但第三个人追到了15号区域，在那里，元素们攻击了他们两个人。",
	"The teleporter here can reach any teleport circle in the tower above, but its controls do not allow characters to return to the sundial.": "这里的传送器可以到达上方塔楼的任何一个传送圈，但它的控制不允许角色返回日晷。",
	"Blood streaks the floor here, including the smeared trail leading back to the teleport chamber and a second trail of bloody boot prints heading up the corridor to the north. Standing amid the gore are three humanoid figures—two that look like misshapen statues of clay and stone and one appearing as a humanoid made of flame.": "这里的地板上血迹斑斑，包括通往传送室的污迹和第二条通往北面走廊的血腥鞋印的痕迹。站在血泊中的是三个人形物体--两个看起来像粘土和石头的错位雕像，一个看起来像火焰制成的人形。",
	"The creatures are 2 {@creature Earth Elemental||earth elementals} and a {@creature fire elemental} Xonthal called forth to guard his workshops. In the absence of new orders, the elementals eternally follow Xonthal's last command to slay intruders. When any character enters the room, the elementals attack. They fight until destroyed, or until the party flees back to area 14 or moves further into the dungeon. The elementals do not pursue outside this area unless attacked from a distance.": "这些生物是2个{@creature Earth Elemental||earth elementals}和一个{@creature fire elemental}Xonthal被召唤出来守护他的工场。在没有新的命令的情况下，元素们会永远遵循Xonthal最后的命令，杀死入侵者。当任何角色进入房间时，这些元素就会攻击。它们一直战斗到被消灭，或者直到队伍逃回14区或进一步进入地牢。除非从远处受到攻击，否则元素人不会在这个区域外追击。",
	"A large, round table with four chairs sits in one corner of the room, with shelves and workbenches arranged along the walls. Books and papers are scattered on the table, along with a locked wooden chest about the size of a shoebox. Opening the lock requires {@item thieves' tools|PHB} and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A failed check sets off a magic {@spell glyph of warding} trap that triggers a {@spell slow} spell affecting all creatures in the area except elementals. Creatures affected by the spell can attempt the saving throw again at the end of each of their turns. Otherwise, the effect ends after 1 minute.": "房间的一角摆放着一张有四把椅子的大圆桌，沿墙摆放着书架和工作台。书籍和文件散落在桌子上，还有一个上了锁的木箱，大小和鞋盒差不多。打开锁需要{@item thieves' tools|PHB}和一个成功的DC15灵巧检查。如果检查失败，就会触发一个魔法{@spell glyph of warding}的陷阱，引发一个{@spell slow}的咒语，影响该区域内所有的生物，除了元素。受该咒语影响的生物可以在他们每个回合结束时再次尝试蓄力攻击。否则，该效果在1分钟后结束。",
	"The writing on the papers and books in the room has become illegible, and the paper is so brittle from the fire elementals' heat that it crumbles at a touch.": "房间里的纸张和书籍上的字迹已经变得难以辨认，纸张因为火元素的热量而变得非常脆，一碰就碎。",
	"It's obvious at a glance that this area was once a wizard's workroom. Worktables are covered with notes, alchemical flasks, beakers, braziers, and other arcane apparatus. More startling is the whirlwind occupying the center of the room. Ten feet across and stretching from floor to ceiling, it swirls endlessly, revealing a number of sparkling gems within it.": "一目了然，这个区域曾经是巫师的工作间。工作台上摆满了笔记、炼金瓶、烧杯、火炉和其他神秘的仪器。更令人吃惊的是占据房间中心的旋风。它有十英尺宽，从地板延伸到天花板，无休止地旋转着，里面露出许多闪闪发光的宝石。",
	"Steps descend to a walkway that appears to stretch across infinite space. Thousands of stars twinkle in unfamiliar constellations, and meteors streak through the vastness above and below the path. Just past the base of the stairs, a door framed by nothingness rises from the path. Fifty feet beyond that, the path meets an intersection, with another door straight ahead.": "阶梯下降到一条似乎延伸到无限空间的走道。成千上万的星星在陌生的星座中闪烁，流星在路径上方和下方的浩瀚空间中闪耀。刚过楼梯底部，一扇被虚无所包围的门从路径上升起。再过50英尺，道路遇到一个十字路口，前方是另一扇门。",
	"This corridor is a relic of Xonthal's experimentation with extradimensional space. The path is formed by the floor of the corridor, which is perfectly solid and secure despite appearing to extend into the void. Reaching beyond the edge of the walkway confirms the absence of walls or ceiling. The atmosphere is thin and cold, but not uncomfortably so.": "这条走廊是Xonthal对超维空间进行实验的遗迹。这条路是由走廊的地板形成的，尽管看起来延伸到了虚空中，但它是完全坚实和安全的。伸到走道边缘之外，证实了没有墙壁或天花板。大气是稀薄和寒冷的，但并不令人感到不舒服。",
	"At an opportune moment when one or more characters are moving along the path, a swarm of tiny meteors shoots past, threatening to knock them off the walkway. All creatures on the path must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to dodge the meteors. On a failed save, a creature is struck, takes 9 ({@dice 2d8}) bludgeoning damage, and is knocked off the walkway.": "在一个合适的时刻，当一个或多个角色在路上移动时，一群小流星射了过去，威胁着要把他们从走道上撞下来。所有在路上的生物都必须在DC10的灵巧救赎中成功，以躲避流星的攻击。如果救赎失败，生物会被击中，受到9({@dice 2d8})的重击伤害，并被击落在走道上。",
	"A creature knocked off the walkway appears to fall into infinite space. Unless the creature can fly or teleport back to the walkway, it quickly vanishes from sight. Roll {@dice 1d4 + 17}; the number rolled is the number of the room where the character materializes and crashes to the floor on the following round, taking 14 ({@dice 4d6}) bludgeoning damage from the fall.": "一个被撞出走道的生物似乎掉进了无限的空间。除非该生物能飞或传送回走道上，否则它很快就会从视线中消失。掷出{@dice 1d4 + 17}；掷出的数字是该角色实体化的房间的编号，并在下一回合坠落到地板上，从坠落中受到14({@dice 4d6})重击伤害。",
	"This circular room is obviously a library or study, its walls lined with bookshelves that extend from the floor to the gently domed ceiling twenty feet overhead. A wheeled ladder is connected to a rail that runs around the curved wall, allowing access to the upper shelves. A delicate, ornate desk stands at the center of the room, surrounded by piles of blank paper. A large map sits on the desk, its corners held down with stones.": "这个圆形的房间显然是一个图书馆或书房，墙壁上摆放着书架，从地板一直延伸到头顶20英尺高的平缓的圆顶。一个带轮子的梯子与环绕弧形墙壁的轨道相连，可以进入上部的书架。一张精致、华丽的书桌矗立在房间中央，周围是成堆的白纸。一张大地图放在桌子上，其四角用石头压住。",
	"The two secret doors in this area are concealed behind swinging bookshelves, and can each be found with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check. The door to the spellbook study ({@area area 20|1d3|x}) is opened by shifting a book at floor level. The door to the observation room (area 19) is located 10 feet above the floor. It is opened by positioning the rolling ladder in front of the door and pushing on the shelf 15 feet above the floor.": "这个区域的两扇暗门隐藏在摇摆的书架后面，只要成功地进行DC15智力({@skill Investigation})检查，就可以找到它们。通往法术书研究室的门（{@area area 20|1d3|x}）可以通过移动地面上的一本书而打开。通往观察室（19区）的门位于离地面10英尺的地方。将滚梯放在门前，然后推开离地面15英尺的架子，就可以打开它。",
	"If anyone but Xonthal opens either secret door, the papers piled throughout the room begin to ruffle as though a breeze blows through the area. Thousands of sheets of heavy paper then fly into the air in a great whirlwind, slashing at any creature in the area. One distinct storm of paper forms around each character on the first round. Every round after that, two more cyclones form, to a maximum of three per character.": "如果除了Xonthal以外的任何人打开这两扇秘门，整个房间里堆积的纸张就会开始褶皱，就像一阵微风吹过这个区域。数以千计的厚重纸张在空中形成一股巨大的旋风，向该地区的任何生物扑去。在第一轮中，每个角色周围都会形成一个明显的纸张风暴。此后的每一轮，都会再形成两个旋风，每个角色最多形成三个。",
	"Treat these paper whirlwinds as {@creature Swarm of Ravens||swarms of ravens}, but they are constructs instead of beasts, and they have vulnerability to fire. When the paper swarms form, they remain on guard in the study for 30 minutes, then collapse to piles of paper once more. They won't pursue characters into the hallway, but will chase them into the two adjoining rooms.": "将这些纸旋风视为{@creature Swarm of Ravens||swarms of ravens}，但它们是构造物而不是野兽，而且它们对火有脆弱性。当纸群形成后，它们会在书房里守候30分钟，然后再一次倒塌成纸堆。它们不会追着人物进入走廊，但会追着他们进入相邻的两个房间。",
	"The contents of Xonthal's library are as valuable as they are voluminous. The wizard's collection includes nearly five thousand books, pamphlets, folios, quartos, scrolls, and tablets with a combined weight of more than a ton. The entire collection would be worth 50,000 gp if it could be moved. Alternatively, the characters can pick out a few especially valuable volumes.": "Xonthal的图书馆的内容既珍贵又庞大。巫师的收藏包括近五千本书籍、小册子、对开本、四开本、卷轴和石板，总重量超过一吨。如果能搬动的话，整个收藏品价值50,000金币。另外，人物可以挑出几本特别有价值的书。",
	"A character trained in one of the following skills can make a check to search the library for a work on that subject: {@skill Animal Handling}, {@skill Athletics}, {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, {@skill Medicine}, {@skill Nature}, {@skill Performance}, {@skill Persuasion}, {@skill Religion}, or {@skill Sleight of Hand}. Multiply the total of the check by 10 to get the gp value of the single most valuable book a character can find on that subject. Each skill check takes 10 minutes, but many characters can be searching at the same time. Characters who search for more books take a cumulative–10 penalty to subsequent checks.": "受过以下技能训练的人物可以进行检查，在图书馆中寻找有关该主题的作品。{@skill Animal Handling}, {@skill Athletics}, {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, {@skill Medicine}, {@skill Nature}, {@skill Performance}, {@skill Persuasion}, {@skill Religion}, 或 {@skill Sleight of Hand}。检查的总数乘以10，就可以得到一个角色在该主题上能找到的最有价值的书的GP值。每次技能检查需要10分钟，但许多角色可以同时进行搜索。搜索更多书籍的角色在随后的检查中会受到累计10的惩罚。",
	"The map shows the region of the Elemental Plane of Fire surrounding the fabled City of Brass. The map cannot be harmed by fire, and is worth 500 gp to a planar scholar or explorer.": "这张地图显示了传说中的黄铜城周围的火元素位面的区域。该地图不能被火伤害，对一个平面学者或探险家来说价值500金币。",
	"The floor of this room is 10 feet higher than the floor of area 18.": "这个房间的地板比18区的地板高10英尺。",
	"A circular pane of crystal ten feet in diameter hangs vertically in this chamber, anchored to the ceiling, walls, and floor by chains. A scene of roiling fire can be glimpsed within the crystal. In front of the crystal, an ornate rod is set into the floor.": "一块直径为10英尺的圆形水晶板垂直悬挂在这个房间里，用链子固定在天花板、墙壁和地板上。在水晶中可以瞥见一副火光冲天的场景。在水晶的前面，一根华丽的杆子被镶嵌在地板上。",
	"A large, simple desk with several ink pots, quill pens, and a single chair occupy the center of this otherwise empty room.": "一张简单的大桌子上有几个墨盒、羽毛笔和一把椅子，占据了这个原本空荡荡的房间的中心。",
	"Xonthal used this room for writing his spellbooks, but those books went with him when he vanished. The ink pots are dried up, but any character trained in {@skill Arcana} will recognize the specific type of ink used for magical writing. The quill pens are exquisitely fashioned and still usable.": "Xonthal用这个房间来写他的法术书，但那些书在他消失后也跟着消失了。墨水罐已经干涸，但任何接受过{@skill Arcana}培训的人物都能认出用于魔法书写的特定类型的墨水。羽毛笔做工精致，仍然可以使用。",
	"This area is lined with shelves holding hundreds of mundane and exotic reagents and components used by Xonthal in his experiments. Most of the supplies have evaporated, congealed, or decayed over long years, but any spellcasting characters can find enough useable materials here to replenish their material components if necessary.": "这个区域的架子上摆放着数百种Xonthal在实验中使用的世俗和奇异的试剂和组件。大多数物资在漫长的岁月中已经蒸发、凝固或腐烂，但任何施法者都能在这里找到足够的可用材料，在必要时补充他们的物质成分。",
	"Where the hallway bends to the northeast, it once again takes on the appearance of a stone corridor.": "在走廊向东北方向弯曲的地方，它再次呈现出石头走廊的样子。",
	"Light shines out ahead as the corridor opens into a room set with comfortable-looking oversized furnishings. In the center of the room, a red-skinned creature wearing armor of flame, bronze, and volcanic stone sits cross-legged on the floor, studying a chessboard.": "当走廊通向一个摆放着看起来很舒服的特大号家具的房间时，光线照亮了前方。在房间的中央，一个身穿火焰、青铜和火山石盔甲的红皮肤生物盘腿坐在地板上，研究一个棋盘。",
	"The creature is an {@creature efreeti} named Taraz the Fair. The name has nothing to do with his sense of justice or fair play, however, but refers to the light hues of his fiery hair. Xonthal trapped Taraz and was trying to bend or trick the efreeti into service when he disappeared. The trapped creature has had over a century of solitude to rue its fate.": "这个生物是一个{@creature efreeti}叫做公平的塔拉兹。然而，这个名字与他的正义感或公平竞争无关，而是指他火热头发的浅色调。Xonthal困住了Taraz，并试图屈服或欺骗efreeti为其服务，这时他消失了。被困的生物有一个多世纪的孤独，对自己的命运感到后悔。",
	"Taraz greets the adventurers with a fiery smile. He assumes correctly that the characters' arrival so soon after {@creature Iskander|RoT}'s appearance is no coincidence, and he uses the missing mage as leverage for negotiating. Taraz's only concern is escape, and he will do anything to win his freedom.": "塔拉兹带着火热的笑容迎接冒险者们。他正确地假设，人物在{@creature Iskander|RoT}出现后这么快就来到这里并不是巧合，他用失踪的法师作为谈判的筹码。塔拉兹唯一关心的是逃跑，他将不惜一切代价来赢得自由。",
	"Taraz's conversation with the adventurers covers the following points—many of which are utter lies designed to help him gain the characters' trust:": "塔拉兹与冒险者的对话包括以下几点--其中许多是完全的谎言，旨在帮助他获得人物的信任。",
	"Xonthal stripped Taraz's power to grant wishes when he trapped the efreeti here, to prevent him from escaping. He will recover his power only when he is freed. (Both false.)": "Xonthal为了防止塔拉兹逃跑，把他困在这里时，剥夺了他实现愿望的能力。只有当他被释放时，他才能恢复他的力量。(两者都是假的。)",
	"Xonthal warded the chamber to prevent the efreeti from harming anyone, so that the wizard and the genie could play chess. Xonthal promised to set Taraz free if he ever won a match. (False on all counts. Xonthal never entered this area, because Taraz can and will harm creatures in his chamber.)": "Xonthal给密室装上了防护罩，以防止伊夫里提伤害任何人，这样巫师和精灵就可以下象棋。Xonthal承诺，如果塔拉兹赢了比赛，他将获得自由。(在所有方面都是假的。Xonthal从未进入过这个区域，因为Taraz可以而且会伤害他房间里的生物）。",
	"The characters are perfectly safe in the corridor. (True, as long as Taraz is confined to area 22.)": "人物在走廊里是完全安全的。(没错，只要塔拉兹被限制在22区。)",
	"Taraz has no desire to harm the characters, and couldn't even if he wanted to, thanks to Xonthal's protective magic. (False. Xonthal's wards confine the efreeti and its magic to area 22, but they don't protect other creatures in that area.)": "塔拉兹不想伤害这些人物，即使他想也不能，这要归功于桑塔尔的保护性魔法。(假的。Xonthal的防护罩将伊夫里提和它的魔法限制在22号区域，但它们并不保护该区域的其他生物）。",
	"Taraz saw a human ({@creature Iskander|RoT}) come down the corridor ahead of the adventurers. He was carrying a mask that resembled a dragon's face, and he looked badly wounded. (All true.)": "塔拉兹看到一个人类({@creature Iskander|RoT})从冒险者前面的走廊走过来。他带着一个类似于龙脸的面具，看起来受了重伤。(都是真的。)",
	"{@creature Iskander|RoT} stumbled and fell off the walkway with the mask into the infinite space beyond, where he undoubtedly is still falling. To rescue him and recover the mask, the characters will need Taraz's help, for the only way to get the mask back from the cosmic well around the walkway is with a wish. The efreeti will bestow this powerful magic on the party in exchange for his freedom. (False on all counts, including the efreeti's ability to bestow a wish.)": "{@creature Iskander|RoT}跌跌撞撞，带着面具从走道上摔下来，掉进了无边无际的空间，毫无疑问，他还在那里摔着。为了营救他并找回面具，人物需要塔拉兹的帮助，因为从走道周围的宇宙井中拿回面具的唯一方法就是许愿。埃弗里蒂人将把这个强大的魔法赐给党，以换取他的自由。(在所有方面都是假的，包括伊夫里提赐予愿望的能力）。",
	"Freeing Taraz is as simple as breaking the line of salt across the entryway. (True.)": "释放塔拉兹就像打破横在入口处的盐线一样简单。(没错。）",
	"In the end, Taraz is desperate to escape the dungeon, and he will promise almost anything—short of continued servitude—to win his freedom. Unless the terms of the deal are ironclad, however, the efreeti will seek a way to weasel out of any bargain once he is free, and to attack the characters out of sheer malice. Because he can fly, Taraz has no fear of falling off the walkway, and he will push characters off it.": "最后，塔拉兹急于逃离地牢，他几乎会答应任何事情--除了继续当奴仆--来赢得他的自由。然而，除非交易的条款是铁的，否则一旦他获得自由，伊夫里提就会想办法摆脱任何交易，并出于纯粹的恶意而攻击这些人物。因为他能飞，塔拉兹并不害怕从走道上掉下来，他将把人物推下走道。",
	"Two massive hourglasses occupy this irregularly shaped chamber. Their glass globes are nearly fifteen feet across, with each hourglass rising almost to the ceiling thirty feet overhead. Each is suspended by chains, pulleys, and gears in such a way that it can be turned over to set its sand running.": "两个巨大的沙漏占据了这个不规则形状的房间。它们的玻璃球有近15英尺宽，每个沙漏几乎都升到30英尺高的天花板上。每个沙漏都被链子、滑轮和齿轮悬挂起来，这样就可以把它翻过来，让它的沙子运转。",
	"Slumped against the wall at the far side of the chamber is the cultist who called to you from the balcony of the tower. His dark robes are charred and torn, and a blue dragon mask is clutched in his red-stained hands.": "斜靠在密室远处的墙上的是那个在塔楼阳台上向你呼唤的邪教徒。他的深色长袍被烧焦了，也被撕碎了，一个蓝色的龙形面具被攥在他满是红斑的手中。",
	"In addition to his mastery of spatial magic, Xonthal dabbled in the manipulation of time. These hourglasses were part of his attempt to control the flow of time, though he abandoned that research. The hourglasses can be rotated by pulling on their chains, but the only effect is a hideous, ear-grating groan. The sand runs, but the hourglasses' magic has long since dissipated.": "除了对空间魔法的掌握之外，Xonthal还涉足了对时间的操纵。这些沙漏是他试图控制时间流的一部分，尽管他放弃了这项研究。沙漏可以通过拉动它们的链子来旋转，但唯一的效果是发出可怕的、刺耳的呻吟声。沙子在流动，但沙漏的魔力早已消散。",
	"Casting a {@spell detect magic} spell reveals faint auras of transmutation magic within the sand of each hourglass. An hourglass has AC 5, 25 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning and thunder damage. An hourglass that drops to 0 hit points shatters, spilling its sand onto the floor. Sifting through the pile reveals {@dice 1d4 + 2} tiny diamonds amid the grains of sand. Each diamond has an apparent value of 100 gp, and a character in possession of a diamond can use a bonus action to teleport to a space it can see up to 30 feet away, whereupon the diamond disappears.": "施放{@spell detect magic}法术会在每个沙漏的沙子中显示出微弱的转化魔法的光环。一个沙漏有5点攻击力，25点命中率，易受击打和雷霆伤害。击中率降至0的沙漏会碎裂，沙子会洒在地上。筛查这堆沙子时，发现沙粒中夹杂着{@dice 1d4 + 2}的小钻石。每颗钻石的表面价值为100金币，拥有钻石的角色可以使用一个额外的行动来传送到它能看到的30英尺以外的空间，在那里钻石会消失。",
	"{@creature Iskander|RoT} has been dead since shortly after he arrived here, slain by the wounds inflicted by the elementals. The (false) {@item Blue Dragon Mask|RoTOS} is bloody but undamaged.": "{@creature Iskander|RoT}在到达这里后不久就已经死了，被元素所造成的伤口杀死了。(假){@item Blue Dragon Mask|RoTOS}是血淋淋的，但没有损坏。",
	"The teleport circle in {@area area 14 |1c6|x} can take the characters back to any level of the tower (areas {@area 8|1b6|x} to {@area 13|1bf|x}). The teleport circles in those areas can take them back to the sundial, from which they can exit the maze. The characters are not yet in the clear, though.": "在{@area area 14 |1c6|x}的传送圈可以把人物带回塔的任何一层（{@area 8|1b6|x}至{@area 13|1bf|x}区域）。这些区域的传送圈可以把他们带回日晷，他们可以从那里离开迷宫。不过，这些人物还没有被清除。",
	"However much Jorgen Pawl opposed {@creature Severin|RoT}, he remained loyal to the Cult of the Dragon. As soon as he understood that the traitorous {@creature Iskander|RoT} was somehow in league with the adventurers, he used {@spell sending} to call an {@creature adult blue dragon} from its nearby lair, telling it of {@creature Iskander|RoT}'s theft of the dragon mask.": "无论约根-波尔如何反对{@creature Severin|RoT}，他仍然对神龙教忠诚。当他了解到叛徒{@creature Iskander|RoT}在某种程度上与冒险者结盟时，他就用{@spell sending}把{@creature adult blue dragon}从它的巢穴里叫出来，告诉它{@creature Iskander|RoT}偷了龙面具的事。",
	"When the characters teleport to the sundial, they are greeted by the terrible sound of villagers screaming, a dragon roaring, and lightning bolts tearing houses to splinters. When they reach the edge of the garden, they see the dragon swooping over the village and terrified villagers fleeing in every direction. A character with passive {@skill Perception} of 14 or higher recognizes this dragon as Lennithon, the adult blue dragon the party faced in the {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}.": "当人物传送到日晷时，迎接他们的是村民们的尖叫声、龙的咆哮声和闪电将房屋撕成碎片的可怕声音。当他们到达花园边缘时，他们看到龙在村子上空俯冲，惊恐的村民向各个方向逃窜。被动{@skill Perception}为14或更高的角色认出这条龙是Lennithon，即党派在{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}中面对的那条成年蓝龙。",
	"Like any smart foe, Lennithon tries to fight on its terms, not the enemy's. It stays in the air and uses its breath weapon to maximum effect. If the characters refuse to face it, Lennithon is happy to wreck the village and murder innocents in an effort to bring the heroes into the open.": "像任何聪明的敌人一样，Lennithon试图按照自己的条件而不是敌人的条件进行战斗。它呆在空中，使用它的呼吸武器来达到最大效果。如果角色们拒绝面对它，伦尼森很乐意破坏村庄并杀害无辜者，以努力将英雄们带到公开场合。",
	"When the characters face the dragon, read or paraphrase the following.": "当人物面对龙的时候，读或转述以下内容。",
	"\"The mask, fools! The mask is what I've come for. Give it to me, and I'll leave these crawling ants with their miserable lives. The Queen is returning! Who are you to hope to stop her? Give me the mask!\"": "\"面具，傻瓜！面具是我来的目的。把它给我，我就把这些爬行的蚂蚁留在他们的悲惨生活中。女王要回来了! 你是谁，希望能阻止她？把面具给我！\"",
	"This dragon is loyal to the cult, but it has no intention of getting killed before {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s glorious return. It fights until it is reduced to 75 hit points, then flies away to recuperate.": "这条龙对邪教很忠诚，但它无意在{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的光荣回归之前被杀死。它一直战斗到生命值降到75点，然后飞走休养。",
	"The fact that the {@item Blue Dragon Mask|RoTOS} is a forgery is quickly discovered by experts at Waterdeep. It becomes a cause for much concern among the members of the council, some of who see it as a sign that the cult might have placed spies within the council. {@spell Speak with dead} used to contact either {@creature Iskander|RoT} or Jorgen Pawl can shed some light on why a false mask might have been supplied to the cultists at Xonthal's Tower, but the false mask might otherwise remain a troubling mystery.": "{@item Blue Dragon Mask|RoTOS}是伪造的这一事实很快就被沃特德普的专家发现了。这引起了议会成员的极大关注，其中一些人认为这表明邪教可能在议会中安插了间谍。(用来联系{@spell Speak with dead}或乔根-波尔的方法可以说明为什么假面具会被提供给松塔尔塔的邪教分子，但假面具可能仍然是一个令人不安的谜。",
	"Early during his rise to power, {@creature Severin|RoT} enlisted the aid of a group of Thayan exiles in his scheme to return {@creature Tiamat|RoT} to the world. He needs the Red Wizards' expertise in the rituals that will open the portal between {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s home on Avernus and the Well of Dragons. Without the Red Wizards, {@creature Severin|RoT}'s plan can't succeed.": "在他崛起的早期，{@creature Severin|RoT}在他返回{@creature Tiamat|RoT}世界的计划中争取到了一群泰雅族流亡者的帮助。他需要红袍巫师在仪式上的专业知识，以打开{@creature Tiamat|RoT}在阿弗纳斯的家和龙之井之间的门户。没有红袍巫师，{@creature Severin|RoT}的计划不可能成功。",
	"The Red Wizards enlisted by {@creature Severin|RoT} are among the many exiled Thayans who have fled the rule of Szass Tam, the lich lord of Thay, and his council of undead zulkirs. So great is the lich lord's wrath that all such exiles are under a sentence of death. The leader of the {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} exiles allied with {@creature Severin|RoT} is Rath Modar, a human illusionist.": "被{@creature Severin|RoT}招募的红袍巫师是众多被流放的泰伊人中的一员，他们逃离了泰伊的巫师领主萨斯-塔姆的统治，以及他的不死祖尔基尔议会。巫师领主的愤怒是如此之大，以至于所有这些流亡者都被判处了死刑。与{@creature Red Wizard|RoT}流亡者结盟的{@creature Severin|RoT}领导人是人类幻术师拉斯-莫达尔(Rath Modar)。",
	"The visit to the embassy will last only a few days, but the location of the meeting is not negotiable. The duties of the tharchion (a Thayan governor) the characters will meet precludes her leaving her post.

	"The characters should understand that without the Red Wizards, {@creature Severin|RoT}'s plans are severely compromised. Moreover, it is common knowledge that Szass Tam wants all exiled Red Wizards dead in the worst possible way. Despite reservations from some on the council, most believe that since the factions and Szass Tam have a common goal, the invitation is worth accepting.": "人物应该明白，没有红袍巫师，{@creature Severin|RoT}的计划就会受到严重影响。此外，众所周知，萨斯-谭希望所有被流放的红袍巫师以最坏的方式死去。尽管议会中的一些人持保留意见，但大多数人认为，既然各派别和萨斯-谭有一个共同的目标，这个邀请是值得接受的。",
	"The final decision is up to the characters, of course. No one will compel them to go to Thay. But in the council's estimation, the potential to delay or even undo {@creature Severin|RoT}'s plan at a single blow is too much to pass up.": "当然，最后的决定由人物决定。没有人会强迫他们去找泰伊。但在议会的估计中，一举拖延甚至撤销{@creature Severin|RoT}的计划的可能性太大，不能放弃。",
	"Travelers to this land must be wary of its dark politics—rampant paranoia, a police-state mentality, and necromancers commanding the top of the social order—as much as the threats of the undead and Red Wizards that dwell here.

	"The Cult of the Dragon discovered the Well of Dragons long ago. Lava tubes snaking beneath the now-dormant volcano formed natural corridors connecting caverns that the cult enlarged for their own use. Within the central caldera, they raised a ritual space for creating dracoliches from dragons drawn to the site knowing they would soon die. Under {@creature Severin|RoT}'s leadership, the caldera and the catacombs beneath it have been repurposed as the site where {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s vast temple will be raised and the Dragon Queen's new reign begun. The floor of the caldera is blanketed with the bones of dragons, mounded into immense, tangled heaps.": "神龙教在很久以前就发现了龙之井。在现在休眠的火山下蜿蜒的熔岩管形成了连接洞穴的天然走廊，邪教组织将其扩大为自己所用。在中央破火山口内，他们建立了一个仪式空间，用于创造龙的仪式，这些龙被吸引到这个地方，因为它们很快就会死去。在{@creature Severin|RoT}的领导下，破火山口和它下面的地下墓穴被重新利用，作为{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的巨大神庙将被升起，龙后的新统治开始。火山口的地面上铺满了龙的骨头，堆积成巨大而纠结的一堆。",
	"The caldera of the Well of Dragons is roughly oval-shaped, with high, steep walls. The dragons flying above it are not scouting for infiltrators, thankfully, but are quarreling and posturing for each other before the battle.": "龙之井的火山口大致呈椭圆形，有高而陡峭的墙壁。谢天谢地，飞在上面的龙不是在侦察渗透者，而是在争吵，在战斗前为对方摆姿势。",
	"In the past, the number of cultists at the Well of Dragons seldom exceeded one hundred. Now, with ultimate victory near at hand, their numbers have swelled. Only cultists live and work in the warrens beneath the caldera. The thousands of mercenaries, giants, devils, and monsters serving the cult are camped chiefly along the north and east slopes.": "过去，龙之井的邪教徒人数很少超过100人。现在，随着最终的胜利近在咫尺，他们的人数已经膨胀了。只有邪教徒在火山口下的战壕里生活和工作。数以千计的雇佣兵、巨人、魔鬼和为邪教服务的怪物主要在北坡和东坡扎营。",
	"A mind-numbing structure has pushed up from beneath the tangled bones to tower above the blasted volcano.

Entrance 3 is never used; the cult believes that this tunnel is still blocked after a collapse sixty years before.": "大多数熔岩管的入口都有明显的路径标志，沿着火山的山坡。{@area Entrance 2A |1f9|x}很少看到使用，所以人物不仔细搜索很可能会忽略它。3号入口从未被使用过；邪教认为这条隧道在六十年前的坍塌后仍然被封锁。",
	"The lava tubes range from 15 to 25 feet in diameter. They are large enough for dracoliches and dragons to move through easily.": "熔岩管的直径从15到25英尺不等。它们大到足以让龙虾和龙轻松通过。",
	"The lava tube corridors are dimly lit by lamps or torches hung on the walls at wide intervals. Chambers within the Well of Dragons are brightly lit by lamps unless otherwise noted.": "熔岩管走廊上每隔一段距离就有一盏灯或火把挂在墙上，光线很暗。除非另有说明，龙之井内的房间都有明亮的灯光。",
	"The sound of the {@item Draakhorn|RoT} constantly moans throughout the Well of Dragons, originating from {@area area 8|201|x}. Combined with the cult's activity in and above the caverns, it creates a constant thrum of background noise transmitted through the stone. Sounds of combat go unnoticed if a fight is over in 3 rounds or fewer, or if the combat is more than 200 feet away from creatures that might hear it. Especially loud noises, such as a {@spell thunderwave} spell, are easily heard.": "龙之井里不断传出{@item Draakhorn|RoT}的呻吟声，源自{@area area 8|201|x}。再加上邪教组织在洞穴内和洞穴上方的活动，它创造了一个持续的背景噪音，通过石头传播。如果战斗在3个回合或更短的时间内结束，或者如果战斗距离可能听到的生物超过200英尺，那么战斗的声音就不会被注意到。特别响亮的声音，如{@spell thunderwave}的咒语，很容易被听到。",
	"As the time for the ritual draws near, the Well of Dragons is crawling with cultists and their allies. Whether using stealth or disguising themselves as cultists, the characters can easily survey the entrances to the lava tubes or see the risen temple from the edge of the caldera. However, once the adventurers enter the Well of Dragons, disguises prove ineffective. The cultists working in and patrolling the caverns are on high alert, and use a complex system of checks and passwords as proof against spies and enemy agents.": "随着仪式时间的临近，龙之井里爬满了邪教分子和他们的盟友。无论是使用隐身术还是伪装成邪教徒，角色们都可以轻易地勘察熔岩管道的入口，或者从火山口的边缘看到上升的神庙。然而，一旦冒险者进入龙之井，伪装就会失效。在洞穴中工作和巡逻的邪教人员处于高度警戒状态，他们使用复杂的检查和密码系统来防止间谍和敌方特工。",
	"The advanced state of the ritual means that all cultists have been ordered to patrol or prepare for battle. If the characters tarry too long in one place or wander around the Well of Dragons without purpose, add additional guard patrols based on existing encounters.": "仪式的高级状态意味着所有邪教徒都被命令去巡逻或准备战斗。如果角色们在一个地方耽搁太久，或者毫无目的地在龙之井周围徘徊，那么就根据现有的遭遇增加额外的警卫巡逻。",
	"Entrances 1B and 1C are within sight of each other, but 1A is hidden from the other two by the curve of the mountainside.": "入口1B和1C在视线范围内，但1A被山坡的曲线所遮挡，无法看到其他两个入口。",
	"Of the tunnel entrances on the east side of the caldera, only 2C is heavily used. All the prisoners held in the warrens are brought through that tunnel on their way to areas {@area 16|20a|x}, {@area 17|20a|x}, or {@area 18|20a|x}. Entrance 2A is seldom used. Entrance 2B is used by the cultists who live in areas {@area 12|207|x} and {@area 13|207|x}, but by no one else.": "在火山口东侧的隧道入口中，只有2C号隧道被大量使用。所有被关押在战壕里的囚犯在前往{@area 16|20a|x}、{@area 17|20a|x}或{@area 18|20a|x}地区的路上都要经过该隧道。2A入口很少使用。住在{@area 12|207|x}和{@area 13|207|x}地区的邪教徒使用2B入口，但没有其他人使用。",
	"No cultist has used this entrance since the tunnel collapsed at the three-way intersection sixty years ago, rendering the passageway useless. Recently, an umber hulk burrowed by accident into these tunnels, reopening the passage in all three directions. As a result, this tunnel offers an unguarded entrance into the caldera and the warrens.": "自从六十年前隧道在三叉路口坍塌，使通道失去作用后，就没有邪教徒使用这个入口了。最近，一个黄褐色的大块头意外地钻进了这些隧道，重新打开了三个方向的通道。因此，这条隧道提供了一个进入火山口和战地的无人看守的入口。",
	"A thin wall of rubble still standing to the east of the three-way intersection makes the cultists believe the passage remains completely blocked. However, the wall can be carefully taken down to allow movement in that direction. Characters at the three-way intersection can feel air moving along the northern part of the tunnel, suggesting open space beyond.": "在三叉路口的东边仍有一堵薄薄的瓦砾墙，使邪教徒们认为通道仍然完全被封锁。然而，这堵墙可以被小心翼翼地拆掉，以允许在那个方向移动。在三叉路口的人物可以感觉到空气沿着通道的北部移动，这表明通道之外有开放的空间。",
	"As a wight, Naergoth has little use for quarters, but the presence of objects that belonged to him in life make this a pleasing spot for him. The chamber looks like the home of a noble knight that was abandoned centuries ago, its contents now covered in dust and hung with cobwebs and pathos.": "作为一个巫师，纳戈斯对宿舍没有什么用处，但生活中属于他的物品的存在使这里成为他的一个愉悦的地方。这间密室看起来就像几百年前被遗弃的贵族骑士的家，里面的东西现在被灰尘覆盖，挂满了蜘蛛网和悲怆。",

	"This cavern holds treasure beyond counting. If the characters seek a particular item and have hours to spend searching, they can probably find it here. A {@spell detect magic} spell is blocked by the metal of the coins, so only items on the surface can be easily found. Place whatever common or uncommon magic items you wish on the surface, but finding something rare should take a long and noisy search.": "这个洞穴里的宝藏无法计数。如果人物寻找某件物品，并且有几个小时的时间来寻找，他们很可能在这里找到它。一个{@spell detect magic}的法术被硬币的金属挡住了，所以只有表面的物品才能被轻易找到。在表面上放置任何你想要的普通或不普通的魔法物品，但找到稀有的东西应该需要长时间的嘈杂搜索。",

	"This well-appointed dormitory houses the most important Wearers of Purple staying at the Well of Dragons. Rows of beds line the north and east walls, with locker-style wardrobes holding mundane gear along the west wall. As the activity at the Well of Dragons reaches its peak, this chamber is empty.": "这间设备齐全的宿舍是住在龙之井的最重要的紫袍人的宿舍。北面和东面的墙上摆放着一排排床铺，西面的墙上摆放着储物柜式的衣橱，里面放着普通的装备。当龙之井的活动达到高峰时，这个房间是空的。",
	"Cultists of dragonsoul and dragonfang rank stationed inside the warrens use these quarters. The chambers are arranged like barracks, with cots for sleeping and trunks for storing personal belongings.

	"If the characters pass this way while the sacrifices are taking place, area 16 is empty except for a dozen corpses of prisoners who died of starvation. However, a half-starved fifteen-year-old human male named Stirling is hiding amid the corpses. Stirling can tell the character that the cultists ushered prisoners towards the caldera a few hours ago, but he knows little else.": "如果人物在献祭时经过这里，第16区是空的，只有十几具饿死的囚犯的尸体。然而，一个叫斯特林的15岁半饥饿的人类男子正躲在尸体中。斯特林可以告诉角色，几个小时前，邪教分子把囚犯引向火山口，但他对其他事情所知甚少。",

	"The dragon bones that blanket the caldera have been pushed away from these exits to create a bleak open plaza connecting both tunnel exits to the entrance to the temple.

	"The temple in the caldera of the Well of Dragons is the same temple that marks the center of {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s realm on Avernus. The Red Wizards' ritual has brought it here to act as a beachhead and beacon for the Dragon Queen, melding it into the caldera floor in the process.

	"When the ritual begins, the temple is the focus of the cult's activity, with {@creature Severin|RoT}'s {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} allies (use {@creature mage} statistics) at the center of the action.

The Red Wizards will then guide {@creature Tiamat|RoT} as she claws her way into the mortal realm.": "当仪式开始时，神庙是邪教活动的焦点，{@creature Severin|RoT}的{@creature Red Wizard|RoT}盟友(使用{@creature mage}统计数据)是活动的中心。祭品的灵魂提供了神奇的力量，在九层地狱和物质界之间打开了一条通道。然后，红袍巫师将引导{@creature Tiamat|RoT}她用爪子进入凡人界。",
	"The interior of the temple is a single open expanse. Though divided into distinct areas, the cathedral-like space has no interior walls or upper floors. Five chapels are devoted to one of the five aspects of {@creature Tiamat|RoT} and the matching branch of chromatic dragons, all surrounding a central apse. The apse and all five chapels rise into separate spires, culminating in the sanctuary at the pinnacle of the central spire.

	"Once your eyes adjust to the stunning chaos of {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s Temple, you see that its interior is a single, cathedral-like space that towers far overhead.

There, a kaleidoscopic whorl of arcane energy rises above the blackened floor, stretching up into the twisting recesses of the temple's central spire.": "红袍巫师站在五个拱顶中的每一个，吟唱并将魔法力量输送到中央的天顶。在那里，一个万花筒般的奥术能量漩涡在发黑的地板上升起，延伸到寺庙中央尖顶的扭曲凹处。",

	"The {@item Mask of the Dragon Queen|RoT} is essential to the ritual, and {@creature Severin|RoT} cannot leave the sanctuary.

	"The simplest approach is a one-to-one matchup, with specific good assets canceling out cult assets. Give the players free reign on matching assets, but weigh in on whether a specific plan has merit if you feel the need. For example, the players might decide that assassins provided by the Zhentarim should counter the sacrificial prisoners by infiltrating the cult complex and escorting those prisoners to freedom. In that case, you might remind the players that the Black Network's expert killers can be put to better use against the cult leaders of {@creature Severin|RoT}'s inner circle, while Harper agents or forces of the Lords' Alliance help in the tunnels beneath the caldera.": "最简单的方法是一对一的匹配，用特定的好资产来抵消邪教资产。让玩家自由支配资产的匹配，但如果你觉得有必要的话，也要权衡一个具体的计划是否有价值。例如，玩家可能会决定，由Zhentarim提供的刺客应该通过潜入邪教建筑群并护送这些囚犯获得自由来对抗牺牲的囚犯。在这种情况下，你可以提醒玩家，黑网的专业杀手可以更好地用来对付{@creature Severin|RoT}的邪教领袖，而哈珀特工或领主联盟的部队则在火山口下的隧道里帮忙。",

	"The process of bringing back {@creature Tiamat|RoT} involves four key components—the treasure amassed by the cult, the {@item Mask of the Dragon Queen|RoT}, the sacrifice of prisoners, and the ritual that is the culmination of all {@creature Severin|RoT}'s mad plans. The crashing or capture of Skyreach Castle has already set back the cult in its goal of collecting suitable treasure for the Dragon Queen, making the other three stages of the process that much more important.": "带回{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的过程涉及四个关键部分--邪教组织积累的宝藏、{@item Mask of the Dragon Queen|RoT}、囚犯的牺牲，以及作为所有{@creature Severin|RoT}疯狂计划的高潮的仪式。撞毁或占领Skyreach城堡已经使邪教为龙后收集合适的宝藏的目标受挫，使其他三个阶段的工作变得更加重要。",

Characters trying to pass as cultists might find this sign useful if they don't overdo it.": "异教徒在公共场合避免使用这种服饰，但了解细节的角色通常能够在人群中识别出隐蔽的龙族异教徒。异教徒有时会用 {@creature Tiamat|RoT} 的手势互相打招呼：右手伸出，掌心向前，五指展开，模仿 {@creature Tiamat|RoT} 的五个头。试图伪装成异教徒的角色如果不过火，可能会发现这个手势很有用。",
	"Cult members venerate dragons as powerful icons and masters, but their worship is reserved for {@creature Tiamat|RoT}. They look forward to the Dragon Queen's return, believing that she will destroy mortal civilization and usher in a glorious reign of dragons—and of those who helped bring about draconic rule. The complex plot dedicated to bring {@creature Tiamat|RoT} to Faerûn has so far seen the cult recover the five dragon masks and collect an immense treasure worthy of the Dragon Queen.

	"Rank in the cult is based on merit and fanaticism. As raw recruits, initiates (represented by {@creature Cultist||cultists} and {@creature Cult Fanatic||cult fanatics}) have no rank and follow the orders of their superiors.

A Wearer of Purple can promote an initiate along the track of {@creature dragonclaw|HotDQ} (first rank), {@creature dragonwing|HotDQ} (second rank), {@creature dragonfang|RoT} (third rank), and {@creature dragonsoul|RoT} (fourth rank).

	"Under {@creature Severin|RoT}'s leadership, most cultists are devoted to {@creature Tiamat|RoT}—but not all. Some of the old guard dislike the cult's new direction, and long for the established traditions and the rise of the dracoliches. A common thought among the dracolich loyalists is that {@creature Severin|RoT} is being played by the fiendish {@creature Tiamat|RoT}. Notable among these members of the old guard are {@creature Naergoth Bladelord|RoT}, the former commander of the stronghold at the Well of Dragons, and Jorgen Pawl and {@creature Iskander|RoT}, two high-ranking cultists in command of Xonthal's Tower.": "在{@creature Severin|RoT}的领导下，大多数异教徒都忠于{@creature Tiamat|RoT}—但并非所有人都如此。一些老一辈成员不喜欢异教团体的新方向，他们渴望传统的建立和巨龙巫妖的崛起。巨龙巫妖忠实支持者中普遍认为{@creature Severin|RoT}被邪恶的{@creature Tiamat|RoT}操控着。在这些老一辈成员中，值得注意的有{@creature Naergoth Bladelord|RoT}，曾经是在龙井要塞的指挥官，以及乔根·波尔和{@creature Iskander|RoT}，掌管着松萨尔之塔的两位高级异教徒。",
	"One such {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} exile is {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}, an illusionist of great skill who long ago made the Sword Coast his home. Having a natural interest in dragons, it wasn't long before Rath Modar came into contact with the Cult of the Dragon and {@creature Severin|RoT}. The young, ambitious cult leader sought powerful magic to locate the scattered dragon masks and to perform the ritual that would summon {@creature Tiamat|RoT} from the Nine Hells. Rath Modar dreamed of an army that could confront and defeat Szass Tam. Out of mutual need, their alliance was born.": "其中一位{@creature Red Wizard|RoT}流亡者是{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}，一位技艺高超的幻术师，他很久以前就把剑海岸当作自己的家园。由于对龙类有着天生的兴趣，不久之后拉斯·莫达尔便与龙之邪教和{@creature Severin|RoT}取得了联系。这位年轻、雄心勃勃的邪教领袖寻求强大的魔法，以便找到散落的龙面具，并执行召唤{@creature Tiamat|RoT}从九层地狱归来的仪式。拉斯·莫达尔梦想着一个能够对抗并击败萨斯·塔姆的军队。出于相互需要，他们的联盟应运而生。",
	"Red Wizards can be encountered anywhere on the Sword Coast (use {@creature mage} stats if necessary), whether operating alongside cultists or on their own. They most often work alone, but two or three Red Wizards might join forces for an important assignment. In a public area where their appearance could put them at risk, Red Wizards favor deep hoods and scarves to hide their faces. Their undead {@creature wight} bodyguards are usually nearby—and often {@condition invisible}. Each {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} specializes in a single school of magic, but all learn spells outside their specialty schools.": "红袍法师可以在剑海岸的任何地方遇到（如有必要，使用{@creature mage}的属性），无论是与异教徒一起行动还是独自行动。他们通常独自行动，但两到三名红袍法师可能会联手执行重要任务。在可能使他们处于危险之中的公共区域，红袍法师喜欢深深的兜帽和围巾来隐藏他们的面容。他们的不死{@creature wight}护卫通常就在附近，而且经常{@condition invisible}。每位{@creature Red Wizard|RoT}专精于一种魔法学派，但都会学习超出其专精学派范围的法术。",
	"Red Wizards don't share the cultists' fanaticism for {@creature Tiamat|RoT}. For them, bringing the Dragon Queen into the world is just one stage of what they call the Thayan Resurrection—the larger plan to destroy Szass Tam and reclaim Thay. They tolerate the dragon cultists but do not acknowledge them as equals.": "红袍巫师不像那些狂热崇拜{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的邪教徒。对于他们来说，将龙女王带入这个世界只是他们所谓的泰亚复活计划的一部分——更大的计划是摧毁萨斯·坦，并夺回泰伊。他们容忍龙邪教徒，但不承认他们是平等的。",
	"Not every {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} on the Sword Coast is working for Rath Modar or the Cult of the Dragon. Some pursue their own interests, while others are spies for Szass Tam. The adventurers might thus find themselves making uneasy alliances with characters they would normally never trust, since the easiest and surest way to eliminate a {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} in service to the cult is to betray that wizard's location to an agent of Szass Tam. However, characters who get too close to Szass Tam's servants and his paranoid vendetta against the {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} exiles might find themselves at the mercy of the Thayans. This possibility is explored more fully in {@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}.": "在剑海岸，不是每个{@creature Red Wizard|RoT}都为拉斯莫达尔或龙之邪教效力。一些人追求自己的利益，而另一些人则是萨斯·坦的间谍。冒险者可能会发现自己不得不与他们通常不会信任的角色结成不安的联盟，因为除掉为邪教效力的{@creature Red Wizard|RoT}的最简单、最可靠的方法就是向萨斯·坦的特工出卖那位巫师的位置。然而，那些与萨斯·坦的仆人和他对{@creature Red Wizard|RoT}流亡者的偏执复仇关系过于亲近的角色可能会发现自己受制于泰国人的怜悯。这种可能性在{@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}中得到了更充分的探讨。",
	"Zariel has directed her mortal agents to assist those who seek to free {@creature Tiamat|RoT}, and her power has made it easier for the Red Wizards to summon devils and for the Cult of the Dragon to find more adherents. However, just as Zariel wants {@creature Tiamat|RoT} out, other devils would be happy to see the Dragon Queen stay in Avernus. Foremost among them is the deposed pit fiend Bel and the devils still loyal to him.": "Zariel已指示她的凡间代理协助那些寻求解救{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的人，并且她的力量让红袍巫师更容易召唤恶魔，让龙之邪教找到更多信徒。然而，正如Zariel希望{@creature Tiamat|RoT}离开，其他恶魔则乐意看到龙女王留在阿维努斯。其中最重要的是被废黜的深渊恶魔贝尔和仍然忠于他的恶魔。",
	"Devils aren't numerous in {@i The Rise of Tiamat} until the final showdown at the Well of Dragons, but their presence elsewhere in the adventure (including the additional encounter \"Devilish Demands\") should make attentive players wonder at the connection between devils and dragons. Devils are supreme manipulators, and if the characters have the opportunity to speak with devils that aren't working for the cult, don't be afraid to offer them diabolical assistance. Such an offer should put all characters—not just those of good alignment—in a bind. Bargaining with devils is a fool's game, but if the alternative is the end of the world, it might be the adventurers' only option.": "在{@i The Rise of Tiamat}，恶魔并不多见，直到在龙井的最后决战，但在冒险的其他地方（包括额外的遭遇“恶魔的要求”）中，它们的存在应该让细心的玩家思考恶魔与龙之间的联系。恶魔是至高无上的操纵者，如果角色有机会与不为邪教工作的恶魔交谈，不要害怕为他们提供恶毒的帮助。这样的提议应该让所有角色——不仅仅是那些善良阵营的角色——陷入困境。与恶魔讨价还价是愚人的游戏，但如果另一种选择是世界的末日，那么这可能是冒险者的唯一选择。",
	"Boisterous and gregarious to a fault, Ontharr is the leading delegate for the Order of the Gauntlet. He has all the justification he needs to support the party (especially if the characters played through {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}). However, the rest of the order is not yet convinced. In particular, the order does not tolerate evil, and if the characters are known to have committed acts of a dubious moral nature, Ontharr Frume will be pressured to withhold his support. Members of the order will seek proof that the party is righteous or has divine guidance, for it is only with the blessing of Torm and the other gods that {@creature Tiamat|RoT} can be defeated.": "Ontharr (奥萨尔) 是一个过于喧闹和爱交际的人，他是铁环骑士团(Order of the Gauntlet)的首席代表。他有充分的理由支持该队伍（尤其是如果角色们通过了{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}）。然而，骑士团的其他成员尚未被说服。特别是，该团不容忍邪恶，如果角色们已知犯下了可疑道德行为，奥萨尔·弗鲁姆(Ontharr Frume)将受到压力不支持他们。骑士团的成员将寻求证据证明该队伍是正义的或者得到了神圣的指引，因为只有在获得图尔姆(Torm)和其他神祝福的情况下，{@creature Tiamat|RoT}才能被打败。",
	"Just as good deeds must be performed in the light for all to see, evil must be shunned and fought at every turn. Members of the order can be won over by heroic and righteous deeds, but they will turn against characters who cooperate with or tolerate evil. The order can best be swayed by actions that demonstrate heroism and divine providence—uniting the metallic dragons to fight {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s brood, for example. Slaying a wyrmspeaker will also serve the party well, while capturing and delivering such a villain to justice will raise them even higher in the order's sight.": "正如善行必须在光明中展现给所有人看，邪恶必须被摒弃并在每一个转折点上与之作斗争。{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的成员可以被英勇和正义的行为所感化，但他们会反对与邪恶合作或容忍邪恶的角色。该组织最容易被那些展现出英雄主义和神圣意志的行动所影响——比如团结金属龙来对抗{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的子嗣。杀死一个龙语者也会对队伍有所帮助，而捕获并将这样的恶棍送上法庭将使他们在该组织眼中更加高尚。",
	"Delaan's oldest friend and mentor is a mighty treant named Turlang who resides in the High Forest. With Delaan's support, many treants will join the fight against {@creature Tiamat|RoT}.": "德兰(Delaan)最老的朋友和导师是一位强大的树人，名叫图兰(Turlang)，居住在高森林(High Forest)。在德兰的支持下，许多树人将加入对抗{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的战斗。",
	"Laeral's primary concern is keeping all parties at the negotiating table, and making sure that concrete actions result from each council's discussions. However, she is leery of committing troops to battle. No stranger to the horrors of war, she is keenly aware that the lands represented by the Lords' Alliance need their soldiers for the protection of their own people. Only when convinced that the Cult of the Dragon is likely to succeed in summoning {@creature Tiamat|RoT} does she change her mind. However, she doesn't trust the adventurers with leadership unless their deeds in the field and at the negotiating table have impressed her.": "莱拉尔的主要关注是让所有各方均坐到谈判桌旁，并确保每次议会讨论都能产生具体行动。然而，她对将军队投入战斗持谨慎态度。作为一名对战争恐怖并不陌生的人，她敏锐地意识到由诸侯联盟代表的土地需要他们的士兵来保护自己的人民。只有当她确信龙之邪教有可能成功召唤{@creature Tiamat|RoT}时，她才改变主意。然而，除非他们在战场上和谈判桌上的行为给她留下深刻印象，否则她不会相信冒险者有领导能力。",
	"During meetings of the council, Melandrach consistently argues for caution and more information, and nothing the adventurers say seems to make any difference. That changes when it is revealed that his lost son {@creature Neronvain|RoT} has become the cult's Green Wyrmspeaker.": "在议会会议期间，梅兰达尔 (Melandrach) 始终主张谨慎和获取更多信息，冒险者们说的话似乎毫无影响。当揭露他失踪的儿子 {@creature Neronvain|RoT} 已成为邪教的绿龙发言人时，情况发生了变化。",
	"Taern Hornblade has lived an unnaturally long life by consuming {@i potions of longevity}. The wizard led Silverymoon for many years as high mage, but eventually ceded control to Methrammar, leader of the city's army and son of its most famous ruler, Alustriel. Though Methrammar remains leader of Silverymoon and a member of the Lords' Alliance, he is too forthright and earnest to succeed as a diplomat. As such, Taern was sent to the Council of Waterdeep in his stead.": "泰恩·霍恩布莱德通过消耗{@i potions of longevity}过上了不自然的长寿生活。这位巫师曾多年领导着辛瑞玛，担任高级法师，但最终将控制权让给了梅斯拉玛，这座城市军队的领袖，也是最著名统治者奥斯特瑞尔的儿子。尽管梅斯拉玛仍然是辛瑞玛的领袖，也是领主联盟的成员，但他过于直率和真诚，无法成功地担任外交使节。因此，泰恩代表他前往了水晶城议会。",
	"However, engaging in mainstream corruption and wanting to see {@creature Tiamat|RoT} ascendant are two different things. The Zhentarim have no illusions about what the Dragon Queen's return would mean for their plans. Wanting to secretly rule the world from the shadows for themselves, the leaders of the Black Network have no desire to become agents and errand-runners for some petty god and her dragon cohorts.": "然而，参与主流腐败和希望看到{@creature Tiamat|RoT}崛起是两回事。黑网络对龙女王的回归意味着什么并没有幻想。黑网络的领导者想要在暗中统治世界，他们并不想成为某个琐碎神灵及其龙伙伴的代理人和使者。",
	"At least one Black Network mission is carried out regardless of payment. Without the knowledge of anyone outside the Zhentarim, one of their agents has infiltrated the cult and gets close enough to Wyrmspeaker {@creature Varram|RoT} to steal the {@i White Dragon Mask}.

	"The metallic dragons will strike against the cultists at the Well of Dragons, but they are much more effective if their attacks are coordinated as part of the overall plan of battle. Moreover, if they can be brought into the alliance represented by the Council of Waterdeep, they can help defend humanoid territories from the cult's devastating raids. This is covered in greater detail in {@adventure chapter 14|RoT|5}.": "金属龙将在龙井对抗异教徒，但如果它们的攻击能够作为整体战斗计划的一部分进行协调，它们将更加有效。此外，如果它们能够加入由瓦特德普议会代表的联盟，它们可以帮助保卫人类领土免受异教徒毁灭性袭击。这在{@adventure chapter 14|RoT|5}中有更详细的介绍。",
	"During each new council, the various factions measure the party's actions and achievements, comparing those actions to their own goals. Characters who further the goals of a faction will find that faction willing to pledge more resources to the fight against the cult. However, gaining the allegiance of one faction might lead to distrust from others. The adventurers must strike a careful balance in their appeal to—and appeasement of—the delegates to gather the strongest force possible to confront {@creature Tiamat|RoT}.": "在每次新的议会中，各个派别都会衡量该党的行动和成就，将这些行动与他们自己的目标进行比较。支持某个派别目标的角色会发现该派别愿意向对抗邪教的斗争中投入更多资源。然而，获得一个派别的盟友可能会导致其他人的不信任。冒险者必须在向代表们呼吁和安抚中保持谨慎的平衡，以聚集尽可能强大的力量来面对{@creature Tiamat|RoT}。",
	"Shortly after the crash or capture of Skyreach Castle, operatives of the Cult of the Dragon sounded the {@item Draakhorn|RoT} at the distant Well of Dragons.

	"One of Remallia Haventree's first acts in her fight against the Cult of the Dragon was to encourage the Harpers to focus all their resources on the cult's activities and its most powerful members.

	"King Melandrach is furious if the characters agreed to an apology for the {@i Dracorage mythal}. He makes the apology because honor demands it, but he resents the party for forcing his hand. Connerad Brawnanvil is similarly unhappy if a concession was made in response to the ancient dragonmoots of the dwarves. The traditions of the dragonmoot saved many lives in their time, and the fact that one metallic dragon was injured indicates that it was probably misbehaving. Dwarves have no patience for tolerating misbehaving dragons, no matter what their color.": "梅兰达尔国王对于角色们对{@i Dracorage mythal}的道歉感到愤怒。他道歉是因为荣誉所需，但他对于被迫这么做感到愤恨。康纳拉德·布劳纳维尔如果对矮人的古代龙会做出让步同样感到不满。龙会的传统在当时拯救了许多生命，而一只金属龙受伤表明它可能行为不端。矮人对于容忍行为不端的龙没有耐心，无论它们的颜色如何。",
	"The Red Wizards are integral to the cult's plans for summoning {@creature Tiamat|RoT}, but the Red Wizards allied with the Cult of the Dragon are exiles with no connection to Thay.

When the proud, ambitious {@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT} arrived in Arauthator's lair, the dragon enticed her with the prospect of becoming Arveiaturace's master and rider.": "阿劳萨托的冰山巢穴主要用作他与他的伴侣、古老的白龙阿维亚图雷斯（“白蛟”）的会面地点。她知晓邪教的活动，但一直不愿加入，并且阿劳萨托正在寻找一种方法来获得她的支持。曾经，阿维亚图雷斯为一位名叫梅尔萨隆德的巫师效力，梅尔萨隆德的尸体仍然绑在龙背上的鞍上。她从未接受他的死亡，仍然像他活着一样与他交谈。阿劳萨托希望，如果他提供一个新的巫师来侍奉阿维亚图雷斯，她将从悲伤中恢复过来，并全力支持龙之邪教。当骄傲、雄心勃勃的{@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT}来到阿劳萨托的巢穴时，龙用前景诱惑她，让她成为阿维亚图雷斯的主人和骑手。",
	"Searching the Sea of Moving Ice for the plateau-like iceberg described by Maccath is a time-consuming process. Roll a {@dice d6} each morning, afternoon, and night. On a roll of 1, an encounter occurs. Roll on the table to determine the specifics, adding +1 for each previous table roll made while the characters were searching from the ship on water by day.

	"Arauthator has attracted a number of ice toads to Oyaviggaton, where they help to maintain the iceberg and the dragon's many treasures and trophies.

	"The floors inside the iceberg are worn glass-smooth from decades of traffic. Arauthator, the ice trolls, and the ice toads move across the slick ice with ease thanks to claws and bony spurs on their feet that give them traction. The dragon's kobold servants wear crampons made of animal teeth strapped to their feet. Characters without crampons or the ability to walk on ice treat all areas of the ice caves as {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.

Snowshoes are of no help inside the iceberg.": "冰山内部的地板因为数十年的行走而变得光滑如玻璃。阿劳萨托(Arauthator)、冰巨魔和冰蟾蜍在光滑的冰面上轻松移动，这要归功于它们脚上的爪子和骨刺，这些结构让它们能够获得牢固的抓地力。龙的龙崽仆从们则穿着用动物牙齿制成的抓钉绑在脚上。没有抓钉或无法在冰面行走的角色将所有冰洞区域视为{@quickref difficult terrain||3}。成功的DC 10智力检定允许角色使用攀登工具包中的物品制作一副抓钉，或将一双适合龙崽大小的抓钉改装成适合中等生物使用的尺寸。在冰山内部，雪鞋毫无帮助。",

The characters must not look into the darkness in the statues' hoods. Any character who does must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw against a {@spell suggestion} spell. Success indicates that the character shrugs off the statue's magic, while failure indicates the character is held by the dark gaze within the stony cowl for 1 round. During this time, the statue whispers impossible secrets to the character, which carry both benefit and burden.": "当第一个冒险者通过房间的中点时，石头磨擦的声音宣告着雕像转动他们戴兜帽的头部以跟随角色的动作。角色们不能直视雕像兜帽中的黑暗。任何这样做的角色必须进行一次 DC 15的感知豁免检定，对抗{@spell suggestion}法术。成功表示角色摆脱了雕像的魔法影响，而失败则表示角色被石头兜帽内的黑暗凝视困住1轮。在此期间，雕像向角色低语不可能的秘密，既带来好处又带来负担。",

	"The dragons have no need to judge the different factions of the Sword Coast, for they know of their reputations and actions already. The dragons' attitudes are effectively fixed in that regard. However, they know also that among all the humanoid races, leaders often determine the character of societies. Though they understand that the adventurers are not the nominal leaders of any faction, the dragons already know that the heroes' actions have set the course of the factions' battle against {@creature Tiamat|RoT}.

	"The gold dragon knows that many of the world's most blighted creatures descend from humans who bargained with dark forces for power, including yuan-ti and tieflings. He considers the cycle of failed human civilizations across Faerûn as a sign of a quintessential flaw in human nature. Moreover, he is quick to point out that humans make up the majority of evil archmages and liches—including Sammaster, who founded the Cult of the Dragon, and Szass Tam's Red Wizards. Even the current leader of the Cult of the Dragon, {@creature Severin|RoT}, and a majority of the cult's members are human.": "黄金龙知道，世界上许多最不幸的生物都是源自与黑暗势力交易获取力量的人类后裔，包括蛇人和堕落者。他认为在法罗的失败人类文明循环是人类本性中固有的缺陷的一个迹象。此外，他迅速指出，邪恶大法师和巫妖中大多数是人类，包括创立龙之邪教的萨姆斯特和萨斯·坦的红袍巫师。甚至龙之邪教的现任领袖{@creature Severin|RoT}和大多数教徒都是人类。",
		"Metallic dragons are known to bestow magic and treasure from their hoards to help heroes from time to time. If the characters do an excellent job impressing the dragons—for example, bringing all five dragons up to an attitude of friendly—or if they roleplayed the encounter well, the council dragons might grant one or more characters with a token of their esteem. This is likely a set of 3 {@item Arrow of Slaying||arrows of slaying (dragons)}, or {@item Armor of Resistance||armor of resistance (lightning)}. Either will prove useful against the cult, especially if the characters have yet to play through {@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}.

(She does not covet it when it might do others good, but simply resents having had it stolen.)": "金属龙以偶尔帮助英雄的方式，将魔法和宝藏从他们的宝藏中赐予。如果角色们在给龙留下深刻印象方面表现出色，例如，让所有五只龙都友好地对待他们，或者他们在角色扮演中表现出色，议会龙可能会授予一个或多个角色一枚他们的尊敬令牌。这可能是一套3{@item Arrow of Slaying||arrows of slaying (dragons)}，或{@item Armor of Resistance||armor of resistance (lightning)}。无论哪种都将对对抗邪教很有帮助，尤其是如果角色们还没有经历{@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}。Tazmikella甚至可以作为让步，归还角色们给她的物品。（当它可能对他人有益时，她并不贪求它，而只是对它被偷这事感到愤怒。）",
	"Even good dragons love treasure, and bestowing a share of the hoard the cult has collected for {@creature Tiamat|RoT} goes a long way toward improving the attitudes of the council dragons. The party can effectively treat the dragons as another faction receiving an equal portion of the hoard, granting one share of the total treasure divided among eleven factions. Doing so improves the attitude of a single dragon by one step. For every additional share the dragons are promised (two shares among twelve factions, three shares among thirteen factions, and so on), the party improves the attitude of another dragon by one step.": "即使是善良的龙也喜欢财宝，并且分享给{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的部分收藏品对改善议会龙的态度有很大帮助。队伍可以有效地将龙视为另一个派系，获得总财宝的一个份额，分配给十一个派系。这样做会使一个龙的态度提升一步。对于每额外承诺给龙的份额（十二个派系中的两份额，十三个派系中的三份额等等），队伍可以使另一个龙的态度提升一步。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon recently took control of Xonthal's Tower—an ancient and mysterious wizard's tower on the southern slope of Mount Hlim.

	"The characters can beat this challenge in several ways. The most straightforward solution is to reduce the boulder with an {@spell enlarge/reduce} spell, then use the same spell to enlarge a strong character to throw it. Other solutions might involve casting {@spell levitate} on the rock and giving it a push, digging a trench for the rock to roll down the length of the field, or propelling it with magic in some other way.

	"The six {@creature Cult Fanatic||cult fanatics} in this room move in as soon as anyone appears in the teleporter. If they can, the cultists try to reach the teleport circle and activate it while one or more characters are still on it. The teleport circle takes only a few seconds to activate, so characters standing in the circle won't be able to move away unless they have the ability to move as a reaction. The cultists select the shrine level as the adventurers' destination.": "当有人出现在传送门时，房间里的六个{@creature Cult Fanatic||cult fanatics}会立即移动。如果可能的话，邪教徒们会试图到达传送圈并在一个或多个角色仍在上面时激活它。传送圈只需要几秒钟就能激活，所以站在圈内的角色除非有能力作为反应移动，否则无法离开。邪教徒们选择将冒险者传送到神龛层级。",
	"Jorgen Pawl ({@creature mage}) and 3 {@creature Cult Fanatic||cult fanatics} are outside this chamber on the balcony when the characters teleport in. All four wait to ambush the first character who steps onto the balcony.

	"The chest contains three scrolls: two {@item Scroll of Protection||scroll of protection against fire elementals} and one {@item Scroll of Protection||scroll of protection against earth elementals}. Characters who claim these scrolls can use them to move safely past the elementals, if they bunch tightly together to keep everyone inside the effect's five-foot radius from the caster.

	"The scrying crystal allowed Xonthal to peer into other planes, and is currently set to view the Elemental Plane of Fire. The view is controlled by the rod set into the floor, and moving it shifts the scene. Doing so properly is challenging, however.

Imbued with potent wards by Xonthal, the salt rings the bases of all four walls and extends across the doorway in the joints between paving stones.

	"Though he has no particular bond with dragons, Rath Modar believes that when {@creature Tiamat|RoT} returns, she will be willing to do favors for those who supported her. In comparison to the feeble members of the Cult of the Dragon, who offer {@creature Tiamat|RoT} devotion but little else, the Red Wizards who opened the gate for her can wield great magical power in her name. All Modar plans to ask in return is the Dragon Queen's aid in overthrowing the hated Szass Tam and restoring Thay to its former glory. Rath Modar and his splinter sect refer to their movement as the Thayan Resurrection.": "尽管拉斯莫达(Rath Modar)与龙没有特殊的联系，但他相信当{@creature Tiamat|RoT}回归时，她会愿意为那些支持过她的人提供帮助。与龙邪教(Cult of the Dragon)那些虚弱的成员相比，他们虽然献出{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的虔诚，却几乎没有其他贡献，为她打开大门的红袍巫师却能够以她的名义行使强大的魔法力量。莫达尔计划要求的回报只是龙女王在推翻仇恨的萨斯·塔姆(Szass Tam)并恢复泰国至昔日荣耀中的帮助。拉斯莫达和他的分裂教派将他们的运动称为泰国复兴(Thayan Resurrection)。",
	"At the start of this chapter, the characters are summoned to a secret meeting by someone they trust on the Council of Waterdeep. At the meeting, they learn that the council has been approached by a {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} of Thay named Nyh Ilmichh. Ilmichh has extended an invitation to the council to send an envoy to Thay, to discuss ways in which Thay and the Sword Coast might aid each other during the current crisis.

	"Thay is an isolated and arid windswept plateau some twenty-five hundred miles east of Waterdeep, its dark skies constantly clouded by volcanic ash. This land is defined by the prevalence of undead within its borders. The supreme leader of Thay is the lich Szass Tam, whose council of advisers—the zulkirs—are powerful liches themselves. Everyone of consequence in Thay is a spellcaster, and necromancers are common there. Undead servants are everywhere, and many of the commanders in Thay's armies are the free-thinking undead soldiers (use the {@creature wight} statistics).": "泰(Thay)是一个偏远而干旱的高原，位于距离沃特德普(Waterdeep)东约两千五百英里，其黑暗的天空经常被火山灰遮蔽。这片土地以其境内不死生物的盛行而闻名。泰的最高领袖是巫妖萨斯·塔姆(Szass Tam)，他的顾问委员会——祖尔基尔(zulkirs)——本身就是强大的巫妖。在泰，所有有影响力的人都是咒术师，那里的死灵术士很常见。不死仆从随处可见，泰军队中许多指挥官都是思想自由的不死士兵(使用{@creature wight}的统计数据)。",

	"The tharchion waits for the characters' response, and engages them in a discussion of what is known of the plot to release {@creature Tiamat|RoT} and the Red Wizards aiding that plot. Her questions are straightforward and intelligent, and offer little opportunity for sly or clever responses. If a character is less than truthful, Eseldra Yeth probes for more information.

	"Rath Modar leads the ritual of guidance, but any {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} can take on that role. When the temple is attacked, he hands over his part in the ritual and leads the attack against the adventurers. See {@adventure appendix D|RoT|12} for {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ|Rath Modar's} statistics.": "拉斯·莫达(Rath Modar)领导着指引仪式，但任何{@creature Red Wizard|RoT}都可以担任这个角色。当寺庙遭到袭击时，他放弃了仪式的部分并带领对抗冒险者的攻击。查看{@adventure appendix D|RoT|12}以获取{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ|Rath Modar's}的统计数据。",
	"The few giants who fight for the cult believe that {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s return is inevitable, but they are sullen and uncooperative. They fight when they see easy victory but withdraw when they sense defeat.": "为该教派而战的少数巨人相信{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的回归是不可避免的，但他们沉默寡言且不合作。他们在看到容易取胜时会战斗，但在感到失败时会撤退。",
	"The temple is necessary as the site of the ritual. Damaging it can help weaken {@creature Tiamat|RoT} if the ritual is successful.": "作为仪式的场所，寺庙是必要的。如果仪式成功，破坏它可以帮助削弱{@creature Tiamat|RoT}。",
	"The mask, the sacrifices, and the ritual can all be targeted by the characters. Doing so effectively might actually end the ritual and prevent the appearance of {@creature Tiamat|RoT}. Even if the heroes cannot manage to end the threat before it begins, however, disrupting any part of the ritual process weakens the Dragon Queen.": "角色可以选择瞄准面具、献祭和仪式。这样做可能会有效地结束仪式，阻止{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的出现。即使英雄们无法在威胁出现之前结束威胁，干扰仪式过程的任何部分也会削弱龙女王。",
	"{@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s heads enter the battle starting on the second round after the ritual is completed, in the following order: white, black, green, blue, and red. Her red head announces the Dragon Queen's full appearance in the sixth round after the ritual is completed. Until that round, {@creature Tiamat|RoT} can make use only of her bite attacks and breath weapons. This gives the characters a last chance to try to weaken the Dragon Queen before she appears.": "{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的头颅在仪式完成后的第二轮开始参与战斗，按照以下顺序：白色、黑色、绿色、蓝色和红色。她的红头颅在仪式完成后的第六轮宣布龙女王完全出现。在那一轮之前，{@creature Tiamat|RoT}只能使用咬击攻击和吐息武器。这给了角色们最后一次机会试图削弱龙女王在她出现之前。",
	"The actions of the heroes in and prior to this final battle can reduce {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s power before she appears. Make a note if any of the following events occurs:": "在这场最终战斗中，英雄们在战斗前的行动可以削弱{@creature Tiamat|RoT}出现前的力量。如果发生以下任何事件，请做好记录：",
	"When any of the previous events occurs, the following penalties are applied to {@creature Tiamat|RoT}, in this order:": "当发生任何先前事件时，按照以下顺序对{@creature Tiamat|RoT}施加以下处罚：",
	"If the characters reduce {@creature Tiamat|RoT} to 0 hit points, her Discorporation trait kicks in. The portal collapses as the shrieking Dragon Queen disintegrates and is dragged back to Avernus. She will remain trapped there until someone else can recreate the conditions of the ritual and try again to free her.": "如果角色将{@creature Tiamat|RoT}减少到0点生命值，她的解体特性就会启动。当尖叫的龙女王被分解并被拖回到阿弗瑞斯时，传送门会坍塌。她将被困在那里，直到有人能重新创造仪式的条件并再次尝试释放她。",
	"Except as noted above, {@creature Tiamat|RoT} should not be arbitrarily weakened in the interest of a fair fight. Presenting the Dragon Queen as anything less than a deity undercuts the whole adventure. Characters who tangle with {@creature Tiamat|RoT} must know that they are in the fight of their lives.": "除非上面有注明，{@creature Tiamat|RoT}不应为了公平的战斗而随意削弱。将龙女王呈现为低于神明的形象会削弱整个冒险的氛围。与{@creature Tiamat|RoT}交锋的角色必须意识到他们正在经历一场生死之战。",

	"Just as most adventurers don't walk into a dragon's lair without a plan, neither were D&D's iconic monsters developed without considerable forethought. This gallery explores some of the behind-the-scenes development that went into creating {@i Tyranny of Dragons}, as well as defining a spectrum of monsters, allies, and enemies that would feature in Dungeons & Dragons offerings for years to come.": "就像大多数冒险者不会毫无计划地走进一条龙的巢穴一样，D&D的标志性怪物也不是毫无考虑地开发出来的。这个画廊探讨了创造{@i Tyranny of Dragons}所需的一些幕后开发工作，同时定义了一系列怪物、盟友和敌人，它们将在未来多年的《龙与地下城》作品中扮演重要角色。",
