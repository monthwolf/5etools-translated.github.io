	"North of the Spine of the World and west of the towering Reghed Glacier is a frigid expanse few dare to explore, let alone inhabit. This icy land of windswept tundra recently became locked in a perpetual, dark winter without reprieve. Auril the Frostmaiden, the divine embodiment of winter's fury, has withdrawn to this cold corner of the world to live among mortals. Further, she has cast a terrible spell over Icewind Dale, to the detriment of most of its denizens.": "世界之脊以北，高耸的雷格德冰川以西是一片寒冷的土地，很少有人敢于探索，更不用说居住了。这片被风吹动的苔原的冰雪之地最近被锁在一个永久的、没有缓和的黑暗冬天。寒霜少女奥里尔，冬天愤怒的神圣化身，已经撤回到世界的这个寒冷角落，生活在凡人之中。此外，她还对冰风谷下了一个可怕的咒语，对其大多数居民造成了伤害。",
	"Each night before midnight, Auril takes to the sky on the back of a white roc and weaves her spell, which manifests as a shimmering curtain of light—a beautiful aurora that illuminates the night sky and fades before dawn. This powerful magic prevents the next day's sun from rising above the horizon, turning midday into twilight and trapping Icewind Dale in winter's dark embrace, with no sunlight or warmth to melt the snow and ice. Each casting of the spell leaves the Frostmaiden weakened, with just enough divine power left to barricade the mountain pass with blizzards and churn the Sea of Moving Ice with blistering winds. Such measures discourage travelers from approaching or leaving Icewind Dale, further isolating the region. Icewind Dale has thus been trapped in a different reality from the rest of the world, for though the sun never rises over the dale, it continues to rise everywhere else.": "每晚午夜前，欧瑞尔骑着白鹏鸟飞上天空，编织她的咒语，表现为一道闪亮的光幕--美丽的极光，照亮夜空，在黎明前消逝。这个强大的魔法阻止了第二天的太阳从地平线上升起，将正午变成了黄昏，将冰风谷困在冬天的黑暗怀抱中，没有阳光和温暖来融化冰雪。每一次施法都会使冰封女巫变得虚弱，只剩下足够的神力用暴风雪封锁山口，用刺骨的寒风搅动移动的冰海。这些措施阻止了旅行者接近或离开冰风谷，进一步孤立了这个地区。冰风谷因此被困于与世界其他地方不同的现实中，因为尽管太阳从未在谷地上空升起，但在其他地方却继续升起。",
	"The people of Icewind Dale know Auril's wrath when they feel it, and they have a name for the unending winter she has inflicted on them. They call it the Everlasting Rime. No one understands why the Frostmaiden has imposed her will in this way or why the other gods refuse to challenge her. This prolonged winter, which has gone on for more than two years, threatens to doom not just the flickering lights of civilization known as Ten-Towns but also the indigenous flora and fauna that need sunlight and the change of seasons to survive.": "冰风谷的人们在感受到欧瑞尔的愤怒时就知道了，他们对她施加给他们的无休止的冬天有一个名字。他们称其为 \"永恒的风铃\"。没有人理解为什么冰霜女巫以这种方式强加她的意志，也没有人理解为什么其他神灵拒绝挑战她。这个漫长的冬天已经持续了两年多，它不仅威胁着被称为 \"十镇 \"的闪烁的文明之光，也威胁着需要阳光和季节变化来生存的本地动植物。",
	"Not all creatures are discouraged by what has transpired north of the Spine of the World. The long nights and sunless days are a blessing to {@creature Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF}, a duergar who longs to carve out a domain for himself on the surface and enslave the people of Ten-Towns in the process. Already, he has taken advantage of Auril's magic and raised a fortress amid the dark shadows of the mountains. From here, his underlings strike out across the tundra in search of chardalyn—a crystalline substance known to exist only in Icewind Dale. Once he gathers enough of it, Xardorok plans to construct a chardalyn dragon and unleash it upon Ten-Towns.": "并非所有的生物都对世界之脊以北发生的事情感到气馁。漫长的夜晚和没有阳光的白天对{@creature Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF}来说是一种祝福，他渴望在地面上为自己开辟一块领地，并在此过程中奴役十镇的人民。他已经利用了奥里尔的魔法，在山脉的黑暗阴影中建立了一个堡垒。从这里，他的手下在苔原上寻找Chardalyn--一种只存在于冰风谷的晶体物质。一旦他收集到足够的物质，Xardorok计划建造一条chardalyn龙，并将其释放到十镇。",
	"Despite Auril's blizzards and other deterrents, visitors still come and go. Among the recent arrivals are four wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood, a powerful society of spellcasters based in Luskan. They've come chasing rumors of a lost city buried under the Reghed Glacier—a fragment of the long-gone Empire of Netheril, whose wizards wielded magic that terrified the gods. Netherese magic has a way of attracting power-hungry wizards, as members of the Arcane Brotherhood often are. The cities of Netheril floated among the clouds, making them almost impervious to assault for centuries. Then, nearly two thousand years ago, this floating city crashed during the fall of the empire, and no one has found or explored it since. It is, arguably, Icewind Dale's greatest secret—a necropolis of Netherese wizards and the magic they left behind. What survived the crash is anyone's guess, but we're about to find out!": "尽管有奥里尔的暴风雪和其他阻挠因素，游客仍然来来往往。在最近到来的人中，有四位来自奥术兄弟会的巫师，这是一个位于卢斯坎的强大的施法者协会。他们是来追寻埋藏在雷格德冰川下的失落之城的传闻--一个早已消失的尼瑟尔帝国的碎片，其巫师们挥舞着令诸神恐惧的魔法。尼瑟尔的魔法有一种吸引渴望权力的巫师的方式，就像奥术兄弟会的成员常常是这样。尼瑟尔的城市漂浮在云层之间，使它们在几个世纪里几乎不受攻击。然后，近两千年前，这座漂浮的城市在帝国的衰落中坠落，此后没有人发现或探索过它。可以说，它是冰风谷最大的秘密--尼瑟斯巫师的墓地和他们留下的魔法。谁也不知道坠机后有什么幸存下来，但我们马上就会知道了!",

	"A duergar despot forging a dragon out of chardalyn. A lost city of magic entombed in a glacier. A frozen wilderness trapped in Auril's grip. These three plot elements, woven together, form this adventure.": "一个二战时期的暴君用查尔达林锻造出一条龙。埋藏在冰川中的失落的魔法之城。一个被困在奥里尔控制下的冰冻荒野。这三个情节元素交织在一起，构成了这个冒险。",
	"The Reghed nomads who stalk the tundra and the Ten-Towners who keep civilization alive are so concerned with day-to-day survival that they typically pay little heed to the evil forces gathering on the fringes of Icewind Dale. Adventurers are much better equipped to deal with such threats, particularly in the dead of winter.": "在苔原上游荡的雷格德（Reghed）游牧民族和维持文明的天主（Ten-Towners）都非常关心日常的生存问题，他们通常很少注意到聚集在冰风谷边缘的邪恶力量。冒险者们更有能力应对这种威胁，尤其是在严冬。",
	"One recent arrival in the area is {@creature Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF}, a duergar warlock formerly of the Underdark. His patron, Deep Duerra, has urged Xardorok to fulfill his destiny and become the first duergar to rule a kingdom on the surface. Icewind Dale is cold, dark, and heartlessly cruel—the perfect realm for Xardorok to claim as despot. Unbeknownst to Xardorok, however, it is not Deep Duerra guiding his actions but the archdevil Asmodeus in the guise of Deep Duerra. In Xardorok, the Lord of the Nine Hells has found an eager and petty tyrant.": "最近来到这个地区的是{@creature Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF}，一个以前在暗黑世界的duergar术士。他的赞助人，深渊杜拉（Deep Duerra），敦促Xardorok完成他的命运，成为第一个统治地面王国的duergar。冰风谷冰冷、黑暗、无情、残酷--是Xardorok成为暴君的完美境界。然而，Xardorok不知道的是，指导他行动的不是Deep Duerra，而是化身为Deep Duerra的大恶魔Asmodeus。在Xardorok身上，九层地狱的主宰找到了一个急切而小气的暴君。",
	"To achieve his goal, Xardorok is scouring the land for chardalyn, which he is forging into a dragon that he will send to destroy Ten-Towns. His sons, Durth and Nildar, lead teams of duergar on quests to retrieve more of this dark-colored crystal for their grasping, despotic father.": "为了实现他的目标，Xardorok正在搜罗土地上的chardalyn，他要把它锻造成一条龙，然后派它去摧毁十镇。他的儿子Durth和Nildar带领着duergar团队进行任务，为他们贪婪、专制的父亲夺回更多这种深色的水晶。",
	"The wizards of bygone Netheril wielded magic that could reshape the world. They used such magic to raise their cities into the sky. The city of Ythryn was one such wonder. It crashed long ago but still exists, buried under the Reghed Glacier on the eastern edge of Icewind Dale.": "昔日尼德兰的巫师们掌握着可以重塑世界的魔法。他们用这样的魔法将他们的城市升入天空。Ythryn城就是这样一个奇迹。它在很久以前就崩溃了，但仍然存在，被埋在冰风谷东部边缘的雷格德冰川之下。",
	"This frozen necropolis holds the remnants of some of the most powerful spellcasters in the history of the Realms, including a Netherese demilich. It also contains a {@i mythallar} (described in {@adventure appendix D|IDRotF|22}), a magic item that can raise an entire city into the air and alter the weather in a fifty-mile radius. The characters can use this device to counteract Auril's spell and free Icewind Dale from her Everlasting Rime.": "这个冰冻的尸骨城保存着一些王国历史上最强大的法术师的残骸，包括一个尼瑟尔人的恶魔。它还包含一个{@i mythallar}（在{@adventure appendix D|IDRotF|22}中描述），一个可以将整个城市升到空中并改变50英里范围内天气的魔法物品。角色们可以用这个装置来对抗奥里尔的咒语，并将冰风谷从她的恒定时间中解放出来。",
	"More than a hundred years prior to this adventure, a wizard named Akar Kessel found an artifact suffused with demonic magic called {@i Crenshinibon} (better known as the {@i Crystal Shard}) and used it to erect a great black tower in Icewind Dale. When this tower was destroyed, the magic used to create it fused with the surrounding ice to form what is now known as chardalyn: a nonmagical, crystalline substance as strong as metal, though considerably easier to work with than steel. In the years since, more deposits of chardalyn have been found across Icewind Dale. Like the {@i Crystal Shard}, these deposits tend to be suffused with demonic magic. Prolonged contact with chardalyn that has become suffused with demonic magic can warp a creature's mind, causing madness that usually fades away once the contact is broken.": "在这次冒险的一百多年前，一个名叫阿卡-凯瑟的巫师发现了一件充满恶魔魔法的工艺品，叫做{@i Crenshinibon}(更多的是称为{@i Crystal Shard})，并用它在冰风谷建立了一座巨大的黑塔。当这座塔被摧毁时，用来创造它的魔法与周围的冰融合在一起，形成了现在已知的Chardalyn：一种非魔法的晶体物质，与金属一样坚固，但比钢铁更容易操作。在此后的几年里，冰风谷各地发现了更多的chardalyn矿藏。与(2%)一样，这些矿床往往充满了恶魔的魔力。长时间接触充斥着恶魔魔力的chardalyn，可以扭曲生物的心智，导致疯狂，一旦接触中断，这种疯狂通常就会消失。",
	"Chardalyn is cold to the touch and readily accepts magical enchantment, making it an ideal substance for wands, staffs, and other magic items. A chardalyn object suffused with the magic of the Upper Planes is considered a consecrated object, while a chardalyn object suffused with the magic of the Lower Planes is considered a desecrated object; both can be identified as such using a {@spell detect evil and good} spell or similar magic.": "Chardalyn触摸起来很冷，而且很容易接受魔法，因此它是制作魔杖、法杖和其他魔法物品的理想物质。充斥着上层世界魔法的chardalyn物品被认为是被献祭的物品，而充斥着下层世界魔法的chardalyn物品被认为是被亵渎的物品；两者都可以通过{@spell detect evil and good}的咒语或类似的魔法来识别。",
	"Long before Akar Kessel left his mark on Icewind Dale, Netherese wizards created their own chardalyn. Many items made from this dark-colored crystal can be found in the ruins of ancient Netherese enclaves.": "早在阿卡-凯瑟尔在冰风谷留下他的印记之前，尼德兰的巫师们就创造了他们自己的Chardalyn。在古代尼瑟斯人的废墟中可以找到许多由这种深色水晶制成的物品。",
	"Four members of the Arcane Brotherhood (a cabal of wizards who act like Wild West gunslingers) have come to Icewind Dale in search of the lost Netherese enclave, hoping to unearth its secrets. Whether the characters choose to aid or oppose these wizards is up to them, but one thing is certain: the Arcane Brotherhood won't let a band of adventurers stand between them and the magic that waits to be found in the doomed, sepulchral ruin.": "奥术兄弟会（Arcane Brotherhood）（一个由巫师组成的阴谋集团，他们的行为就像西部的枪手）的四名成员来到冰风谷，寻找失落的尼瑟斯飞地，希望能发掘出它的秘密。角色们是选择帮助还是反对这些巫师，由他们自己决定，但有一点是肯定的：奥术兄弟会不会让一帮冒险者挡在他们和等待在这个注定灭亡的废墟中发现的魔法之间。",
	"Anyone who hopes to reach the Netherese city buried in the ice must first visit Auril's island and obtain {@item The Codicil of White|IDRotF}, a book compiled by the Frostmaiden's most ardent followers.

This poem has the power to crack the Reghed Glacier, opening a path from the surface to the buried Netherese city of Ythryn.": "任何希望到达埋藏在冰中的尼瑟斯城的人都必须首先访问奥里尔的岛屿并获得{@item The Codicil of White|IDRotF}，一本由冰霜女巫最热心的追随者编纂的书。这本书包含了一首写成诗的魔法咒语。这首诗有能力破解雷格德冰川，打开一条从地表到被埋葬的尼瑟斯城市Ythryn的道路。",

	"The character with this secret knows the location of the crashed nautiloid in {@area chapter 2|346|x} and can lead the party to it. The trauma of being held captive by the illithids prevents the character from remembering events prior to the crash. A {@spell greater restoration} spell removes this trauma, allowing the character to remember details about the illithids as well as the other prisoners aboard the nautiloid when it crashed (a bulette and two carrion crawlers).": "拥有这个秘密的人知道坠毁的鹦鹉螺的位置，并且可以带领大家找到它。被伊利特人囚禁的创伤使该人物无法回忆起坠机前的事件。一个{@spell greater restoration}的法术可以消除这种创伤，让这个角色能够记住关于illithids的细节，以及鹦鹉螺号坠毁时的其他俘虏（一个bulette和两个腐尸爬虫）。",
	"This is one of the more useful secrets, since the character possessing it is immune to the effects of extreme cold. Also, the player might decide that their character is sympathetic toward Auril because of the gift she has bestowed. If the party succeeds in killing Auril, the benefits of this secret are lost.": "这是一个比较有用的秘密，因为拥有它的角色对极寒的影响是免疫的。另外，玩家可能会决定他们的角色因为奥里尔赐予的礼物而对她产生同情。如果玩家成功地杀死了奥里尔，这个秘密的好处就会消失。",
	"This secret comes to light when the player chooses the character's secret lover.

	"Ten-Towns didn't spring up overnight. It started from humble beginnings four centuries ago. Immigrants from all over Faerûn came here in search of escape or adventure and built a modest trade post atop the hill where Bryn Shander now stands. One by one, settlements sprung up on the shores of Maer Dualdon, Lac Dinneshere, and Redwaters. The ever-present threat of orcs and other monsters compelled the poorly defended lakeside towns to turn Bryn Shander from a modest hilltop trading post into a walled town capable of defending all Ten-Towners if and when the worst comes.": "腾博会官网诚信为本并不是一夜之间崛起的。它是在四个世纪前从卑微的起点开始的。来自法鲁恩各地的移民来到这里寻找逃生或冒险，并在现在布林山德所在的山顶上建立了一个简陋的贸易站。一个接一个的定居点在Maer Dualdon、Lac Dinneshere和Redwaters的海岸上兴起。兽人和其他怪物无处不在的威胁迫使这些防卫薄弱的湖边小镇将布林山德从一个简陋的山顶贸易站变成了一个有围墙的小镇，在最坏的情况发生时，能够保卫所有的Ten-Towners。",
	"Most of the towns contain trace evidence of the immigrant cultures that birthed them. This evidence is carved into houses, statues, and other fixtures. For example, the dinosaur carvings on the older buildings of Good Mead remind folk that many of its original settlers were Chultan.": "大多数城镇都有孕育它们的移民文化的痕迹。这些证据被刻在房屋、雕像和其他装置上。例如，古德米德的老建筑上的恐龙雕刻提醒人们，其最初的定居者中有许多是楚丹人。",
	"Residents of Ten-Towns tend to remain indoors when they're not working, since it's so frightfully cold outside, which gives each settlement a deathly quiet aspect. Most people who venture outdoors are bundled up in so much cold weather clothing as to be barely recognizable, and they don't stand around long enough for the cold wind to get the better of them.": "十镇的居民在不工作的时候倾向于留在室内，因为外面冷得吓人，这使每个定居点都有一种死一般的安静。大多数冒险到户外的人都被捆绑在寒冷的天气里，几乎无法辨认，而且他们不会站在那里太久，因为寒风会让他们更难受。",
	"Auril's winter spell has caused the population of Ten-Towns to dwindle and has heightened rivalries that have simmered for years, turning neighboring towns against one another as competition for resources becomes increasingly intense. The alliance of Ten-Towns won't hold if the mounting tribalism continues to threaten the common good.": "奥里尔的冬季魔咒导致十镇的人口减少，并加剧了酝酿多年的竞争，随着对资源的竞争变得越来越激烈，邻近的城镇也开始相互对抗。如果日益严重的部落主义继续威胁到共同利益，十镇联盟将无法维持。",
	"Most of the ten towns except Bryn Shander are built on the shores of three big lakes. The largest population of knucklehead trout is in Maer Dualdon, the deepest of the lakes. Redwaters, the shallowest lake, almost completely freezes in winter, making the fishing there difficult. Lac Dinneshere catches the worst of the winds blowing off the Reghed Glacier to the east and thus has the roughest waters. Small thermal vents at the bottom of these lakes keep them from freezing completely, even in the coldest winters.": "除布林山德外，这十个城镇中的大多数都建在三个大湖的岸边。最深的湖泊Maer Dualdon是最大的节头鳟鱼种群。最浅的湖泊--红水湖（Redwaters）在冬季几乎完全结冰，使得那里的捕鱼变得困难。Dinneshere湖赶上了东面Reghed冰川吹来的最坏的风，因此拥有最汹涌的水域。这些湖泊底部的小型热力喷口使它们即使在最冷的冬天也不会完全冻结。",
	"Ten-Towns fishing boats are simple affairs. The smallest are rowboats and single-masted skiffs that require careful handling to avoid capsizing. Larger, twin-masted cogs and keelboats with single decks handle the wind and waves better. These ships fly the flags of their towns and provide fish for the whole community, not for any individual fisher.": "Ten-Towns渔船是简单的事务。最小的是划艇和单桅小船，需要小心操作以避免翻船。较大的双桅小船和单层甲板的龙骨船能更好地处理风和浪。这些船挂着他们城镇的旗帜，为整个社区提供鱼，而不是为任何个别渔民。",
	"When thick ice covers the lakes, many fishers stay to the shelters of their homes and hearths, but the most dedicated or desperate cut holes in the ice and dangle their lines down in hopes of tempting hungry trout.": "当厚厚的冰层覆盖在湖面上时，许多渔民呆在家里和炉灶的庇护所里，但最热心或最绝望的人在冰上凿洞，把鱼线垂下来，希望能引诱饥饿的鳟鱼。",
	"The folk of Ten-Towns don't have a lot of options when it comes to keeping warm. People from Good Mead, Lonelywood, and Termalaine burn wood salvaged from nearby forests to heat their houses. In the other towns of Icewind Dale, wood is too precious a commodity to burn, so whale oil is used in lamps and small stoves around which townsfolk huddle for warmth.": "在取暖方面，十镇的居民没有太多的选择。来自Good Mead、Lonelywood和Termalaine的人们燃烧着从附近森林打捞上来的木材来取暖。在冰风谷的其他城镇，木材太过珍贵而无法燃烧，所以鲸鱼油被用在灯和小炉子上，镇民们挤在一起取暖。",
	"Ten-Towners buy their whale oil from whalers who live on the shores of the Sea of Moving Ice. Whaling is thus a lucrative (if inherently dangerous) business in Icewind Dale.": "Ten-Towners从居住在移动冰海海岸的捕鲸者那里购买鲸鱼油。因此，在冰风谷，捕鲸是一项有利可图的生意（尽管本身就很危险）。",
	"The Winter Survival Gear table provides costs for cold weather clothing, crampons, and snowshoes, which can be added to the list of things that characters can buy in Ten-Towns.": "冬季生存装备表提供了防寒服、登山杖和雪鞋的费用，这些都可以添加到人物在十城可以购买的东西列表中。",

	"Snowshoes reduce the likelihood of their wearer getting stuck in the deep snow.": "雪鞋减少了穿戴者陷入深雪中的可能性。",
	"Most Ten-Towners travel from town to town on foot. Those who need to transport more goods than they can carry use wooden sleds pulled by dogs or domesticated axe beaks as pack animals. Such things can be bought and sold in every Ten-Towns settlement.": "大多数天镇人从一个镇到另一个镇都是步行。那些需要运输更多货物的人则使用狗拉的木制雪橇或驯化的斧头嘴作为驮运动物。这种东西在每个天镇定居点都可以买到和卖到。",
	"An empty sled costs 20 gp, weighs 300 pounds, and has room at the back for one driver.

	"Residents in a three-snowflake town are friendly and helpful, by and large. Conversely, a one-snowflake town is full of unhelpful, unfriendly folk. A two-snowflake town has both.": "大体上，三片雪花镇的居民都很友好，乐于助人。相反，一朵雪花的小镇充满了无助的、不友好的居民。两片雪花的小镇两者都有。",
	"A three-snowflake town is where characters are most likely to find the services they need. A two-snowflake town has a much narrower selection. Characters will have trouble getting any sort of service in a one-snowflake town.": "三片雪花的小镇是最有可能找到他们需要的服务的地方。两片雪花的小镇的选择范围要窄得多。在一朵雪花的小镇上，人物将很难得到任何形式的服务。",
	"Characters can find decent food and drink, as well as warm beds, in a three-snowflake town. A two-snowflake town might have a small tavern plus an inn with drafty rooms to rent. A one-snowflake town might have a cold shed or attic where characters can crash for the night, and that's about it.": "角色可以在三雪花镇找到体面的食物和饮料，以及温暖的床。一个两片雪花的小镇可能有一个小酒馆和一个有通风房间出租的旅馆。一片雪花的小镇可能有一个寒冷的棚子或阁楼，角色可以在那里过夜，仅此而已。",
	"The desperate people of Ten-Towns, hoping to appease Auril so that summer can return to Icewind Dale, make sacrifices to the Frostmaiden on nights of the new moon. This is a new practice that started a little over a year ago, when it became clear that Auril was angry and summer would not be returning anytime soon. The town speakers (see the \"Council of Speakers\" sidebar) have unanimously agreed to honor these practices, which they consider necessary evils, but would end them in a heartbeat if Auril were to be appeased or dealt with in some other way.": "十镇绝望的人们，希望能安抚欧瑞尔，使夏天能回到冰风谷，在新月之夜向冰霜女巫献祭。这是一种新的做法，始于一年多以前，当时很明显，欧瑞尔很生气，夏天不会很快回来。镇上的议长们（见 \"议长委员会 \"侧栏）一致同意尊重这些做法，他们认为这是必要的罪恶，但如果奥里尔被安抚或以其他方式处理，他们会立即终止这些做法。",

Ferocious blizzards make the mountain pass through the Spine of the World exceedingly treacherous, and this land has not felt the warmth of the sun in over two years. In fact, the sun no longer appears above the mountains, not even in what should be the height of summer. In this frozen tundra, darkness and bitter cold reign as king and queen.

One of the larger sacks on Torrga's sled contains the frozen corpse of a male half-elf in his thirties with a stab wound in his chest. The half-elf had a bounty on his head and came to Icewind Dale to disappear. Torrga found him and killed him with Sephek's help.

	"The best way to deal with Sephek is to confront him while he's separated from Torrga and her other cronies. Sephek stays close to Torrga during business hours.

After Torrga retires for the night, Sephek is free to do as he pleases until the following morning. If he happens to be in Bryn Shander, Easthaven, or Targos, he stalks his next murder victim. If he's elsewhere, he spends the night drinking and carousing, then falls asleep for a few hours, preferably in an unheated place such as a barn or an abandoned cottage.": "对付Sephek的最好办法是在他与Torrga和她的其他亲信分开时与他对峙。塞菲克在营业时间内与托尔加保持密切联系。一旦活动减少，托尔加就会在一天之内关闭她的业务，把狗放在狗窝里，把雪橇放在一个安全的棚子里，并支付团队的住宿费。在托尔加退休过夜后，塞菲克可以自由地做他喜欢的事，直到第二天早上。如果他碰巧在布林山德、伊士文或塔戈斯，他就会跟踪他的下一个谋杀受害者。如果他在其他地方，他就会在晚上喝酒和狂欢，然后睡上几个小时，最好是在一个没有暖气的地方，比如谷仓或废弃的小屋。",

In truth, Sephek was not born during Midwinter. He was a mariner whose ship sank off the coast of Auril's island a few months ago. He swam to the island but nearly froze to death. As his life was fading, the spirit of a frost druid beholden to Auril possessed him. The winter spirit cannibalized Sephek's spirit and is using him as a living vessel to do the Frostmaiden's work. The spirit can't leave Sephek's body; if Sephek dies, the winter spirit is destroyed along with him.": "当被问及他奇怪的着装风格时，{@creature Sephek Kaltro|IDRotF}声称他是在中秋节出生的，而且冰霜女巫的祝福能保护他免受寒冷。事实上，塞菲克并不是在仲冬节期间出生的。他是一个水手，几个月前他的船在奥里尔岛的海岸边沉没了。他游到岛上，但几乎被冻死了。当他的生命逐渐消逝时，一个听命于欧瑞尔的冰霜德鲁伊的灵魂附身于他。冬日之魂吞噬了塞菲克的灵魂，并将他作为一个活的容器来做冰霜女巫的工作。灵魂不能离开萨菲克的身体；如果萨菲克死了，冬天的灵魂也会随着他一起毁灭。",

As Hlin suspects, he has been killing Ten-Towners who pay off low-ranking town officials to exclude their names from the lotteries in Bryn Shander, Easthaven, and Targos. Because he's doing the Frostmaiden's work, the spirit inside Sephek doesn't care about getting caught, and he isn't shy about admitting his guilt. He considers surrendering only because it buys time for him to escape and commit more murders. In combat, he wields a magical sword and magical daggers made of ice that he can conjure at will.

Over the next few years, many explorers in the region came to see the Caer for themselves, and some built cottages in the shadow of its walls. No sooner had the small town taken hold than marauding orcs swept down from the tundra to put it to the torch. The town's residents tried to take refuge in the castle, but the Dinevs, alarmed by the size of the orc horde, barred the gates and refused to open them. The orcs fell upon the stranded people and slaughtered them to the last one. The Dinevs survived the initial assault, but not the siege that followed. After three weeks of being confined in the Caer, the Dinevs were so weakened by hunger that they were unable to resist when the orcs scaled the castle walls. Thus, the Dinev family's brief rule in Icewind Dale came to a bloody end.": "这座小城堡是四百多年前由来自科米尔的迪内夫家族建造的，当时十镇还没有任何东西，只是一些分散的探险者营地，靠土地为生。迪内夫家族希望对冰风谷这块未开发的土地拥有主权。当这座被称为Caer-Dineval的城堡完工后，工人们和他们的家人在悬崖下较远的地方建造的附属建筑中定居下来，同时还有Dinevs带来的家臣的家人。在接下来的几年里，该地区的许多探险家来到这里亲眼目睹了Caer，一些人在城墙的阴影下建造了小屋。小镇刚站稳脚跟，掠夺性的兽人就从苔原上冲下来，把它烧成灰烬。镇上的居民试图在城堡里避难，但迪涅夫人被兽人部落的规模所惊吓，封锁了大门并拒绝打开。兽人扑向受困的人们，将他们屠杀殆尽。迪内夫人在最初的攻击中幸存下来，但没有在随后的围攻中幸存。在被关在凯尔的三个星期后，迪内夫家族因饥饿而变得非常虚弱，当兽人翻越城堡的墙壁时，他们无法抵抗。因此，迪内夫家族在冰风谷的短暂统治就这样血腥地结束了。",

The cultists' stories are all the same: the archdevil reached out to them in their minds as they were freezing to death, offering a second chance at life in exchange for their absolute devotion. After they agreed to follow Levistus, a pale glow caught their eye in the snow nearby, leading to the discovery of a sword-shaped amulet of chardalyn. Each of these amulets has an inner radiance that provides warmth and aid, protecting its wearer against the cold while guiding them safely back to civilization. Once its wearer reaches Ten-Towns, the talisman loses its inner radiance, yet the cultists keep their amulets as signs of their devotion to the archduke of Stygia (see the \"Chardalyn Amulets\" sidebar).": "大多数邪教徒都是冰风谷的本地人，如果不是莱维斯托斯为他们出面干预，他们就会在荒野中灭亡。这些邪教徒的故事都是一样的：当他们快要冻死的时候，大恶魔在他们的脑海中向他们伸出了手，提供了第二次生命的机会，以换取他们的绝对奉献。在他们同意追随莱维斯特后，附近的雪地上有一道淡淡的光芒吸引了他们的目光，导致他们发现了一个剑形的查尔达林护身符。这些护身符中的每一个都有内在的光芒，提供温暖和帮助，保护佩戴者抵御寒冷，同时引导他们安全返回文明社会。一旦佩戴者到达十镇，护身符就会失去内在的光芒，但崇拜者会保留他们的护身符，作为他们对斯蒂吉亚大公的奉献的标志（见 \"Chardalyn护身符 \"侧边栏）。",

The cult's oldest living member, Hethyl (a peg-legged shield dwarf who has lost her right foot to frostbite), hates duergar as most dwarves do.

	"The cultists shun contact with outsiders and, posing as members of Speaker Crannoc's staff, turn away all visitors to the castle. If the time is right, however, they welcome the characters with open arms. That time comes when Levistus instructs the cultists, in no uncertain terms, to form an alliance with the party. For that to happen, one of the following statements must be true:": "这些邪教分子回避与外人接触，并冒充克兰诺克议长的工作人员，拒绝所有进入城堡的访客。然而，如果时机成熟，他们会张开双臂欢迎这些人物。当莱维斯托斯明确指示邪教分子与本方结成联盟时，这个时机就来了。要做到这一点，下面的说法必须有一个是真的。",

Following the footprints leads to a different set of tracks, which were made by an ogre zombie pulling a dogsled. These new tracks begin where the duergar tracks end, a quarter-mile outside of town. (The ogre zombie waited all night for the duergar to return. The duergar hopped onto the dogsled before ordering the ogre zombie to march.) Any character who examines these tracks and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check identifies the creature tracks as belonging to an ogre. The characters can follow these fresh tracks, which head toward the mountain and then veer toward the duergar outpost hidden in the northeastern foothills of Kelvin's Cairn.": "如果角色们等到早上再出发，他们会发现一串新的脚印，这是一个孤独的duergar侦察员留下的。这个精灵没有进入任何建筑物，只是在村子里看了看，然后在接近早晨的时候离开。沿着这些脚印，可以找到另一组脚印，这是一个拉着雪橇的食人魔僵尸留下的。这些新的脚印从杜尔加脚印的终点开始，在镇外四分之一英里的地方。(食人魔僵尸等了一整夜，等着杜尔加回来。二人组在命令食人魔僵尸行进之前，跳上了雪橇）。任何检查这些足迹并在DC15智慧({@skill Survival})检查中成功的角色都能识别出这些生物足迹是属于食人魔的。人物可以沿着这些新鲜的足迹前进，这些足迹朝山的方向前进，然后转向隐藏在凯尔文巢穴东北部山麓的杜格尔人前哨。",
	"Once the characters get within a mile of the outpost, they discover that the wind has erased the tracks they've been following, making it difficult for them to find the exact destination. For every hour the characters spend searching the foothills, have them make a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) group check. Jarthra contributes to this group check, if she's present, and has advantage on her roll. If the group check succeeds, the characters find the outpost. If the group check fails, they didn't find the outpost during that hour but can try again. If they fail two of these group checks in a row, the characters have a random encounter in the wilderness, possibly during a blizzard (see \"{@area Wilderness Encounters|28e|x}\").": "当人物进入到离前哨站一英里的范围内时，他们发现风已经抹去了他们一直以来的足迹，使他们很难找到确切的目的地。人物在山脚下每搜寻一小时，就让他们进行一次DC15的智慧（{@skill Survival}）集体检查。如果Jarthra在场的话，她会对这个团体检定做出贡献，并且在她的检定中具有优势。如果团体检查成功，角色们就能找到前哨。如果团体检查失败，他们在那一小时内没有找到前哨，但可以再试一次。如果连续两次团体检查失败，人物就会在荒野中随机遭遇，可能是在暴风雪中（见\"{@area Wilderness Encounters|28e|x}\"）。",

Waylen is willing to pay 50 gp for each stolen fragment that is returned to him.

On a failed check, no useful information is obtained. If the check succeeds, the character is urged to speak with Scython, the tiefling ferryman, who spends most of his free time in a tavern called the Wet Trout. Scython is widely regarded as a font of useful information. Although he doesn't know anything about the duergar or the stolen chardalyn, he knows several rumors that might steer the characters in new directions (see \"{@area The Wet Trout|166|x}\").

From what the hunters have seen, their prey is smarter than the average moose, and its white hide makes it hard to spot in the snow. What they don't know is that the moose is using a magic mirror as a scrying device to show it where its enemies are.": "一只白色的驼鹿正在孤独林附近的森林里攻击伐木工人。该镇的伐木业对十镇的发展和生存至关重要，议长尼姆西-哈德向其他发言者保证，孤独林的 \"驼鹿问题 \"将在短期内得到解决。猎人已经被派去杀死驼鹿，但到目前为止，驼鹿还没有被他们发现。根据猎人的观察，他们的猎物比一般的驼鹿更聪明，而且它的白色皮毛使它在雪地上很难被发现。他们不知道的是，驼鹿正在使用一面魔镜作为窥探装置，以显示它的敌人在哪里。",
	"Speaker Huddle tries to seduce the characters with a basket of halfling-shaped cookies, hoping they'll join the hunt for the white moose. If the characters turn her down, Speaker Huddle sweetens the deal with coin.": "Huddle议长试图用一篮子半身人形状的饼干来引诱这些人物，希望他们能加入寻找白驼鹿的行列。如果角色们拒绝了她，哈德议长就会用硬币作为交易的甜头。",
	"If the characters aren't staying in Nimsy Huddle's attic, they are summoned to the town speaker's home by one of her children—a cheery little halfling named Scoop. When the characters pay Speaker Huddle a visit, read:": "如果人物不是住在Nimsy Huddle的阁楼上，他们就会被她的一个孩子--一个名叫Scoop的愉快的小半身人--召唤到镇上演讲者的家里。当人物去拜访哈德议长时，请阅读。",
	"Nimsy Huddle, the town speaker, tempts you with freshly baked, halfling-shaped cookies. Her house was clearly built for humans, but most of the furniture is sized for halflings, with a few big chairs for visitors of taller stock. Four halfling children scamper from room to room and climb a ladder up to the loft, chasing one another with wooden swords, while a fire crackles in the hearth in Speaker Huddle's cluttered kitchen.": "Nimsy Huddle是镇上的发言人，她用新鲜出炉的半身人形状的饼干来诱惑你。她的房子显然是为人类建造的，但大多数家具都是为半身人设计的，还有几把大椅子供身材高大的访客使用。四个半身人的孩子从一个房间跑到另一个房间，爬上梯子到阁楼，用木剑互相追逐，而哈德议长杂乱的厨房里的壁炉里火光冲天。",
	"\"Our loggers are being terrorized by a white moose,\" says Speaker Huddle, \"and the beast has eluded the hunters we've sent to kill it. We depend on the forest for our survival. I wouldn't be a very good town speaker if I let a dumb moose get the better of us. Will you help?\"": "\"我们的伐木工人正受到一只白驼鹿的恐吓，\"哈德议长说，\"这只野兽躲过了我们派去杀死它的猎手。我们的生存依赖于森林。如果我让一只愚蠢的驼鹿影响了我们，我就不是一个很好的城镇发言人。你愿意帮忙吗？\"",
	"If the characters demand more than tasty treats as an incentive, Speaker Huddle is willing to pay them 100 gp for the moose's head, though she can be talked up to 125 gp with a successful DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. She suggests that the characters can sell the moose's carcass to a local butcher for 10 gp. If the characters want the pot sweetened further, Speaker Huddle says she can offer them Ramshackle (the closed inn) as an investment property, to do with what they will. \"Of course,\" she adds with a smile, \"if our hunters get the moose first, the rewards will be theirs!\"": "如果角色们要求的奖励不仅仅是美味的食物，哈德议长愿意为驼鹿的头付给他们100金币，不过如果成功通过DC15魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查，她可以被说服到125金币。她建议角色们可以把麋鹿的尸体以10金币的价格卖给当地的一个屠夫。如果角色们想要更多的甜头，Huddle议长说她可以给他们提供Ramshackle（关闭的旅馆）作为投资物业，让他们做他们想做的事。\"当然，\"她笑着补充说，\"如果我们的猎人先得到麋鹿，奖励就是他们的了！\"",

The ship's cocaptains, Vorryn Q'uuol and Dredavex Sinfiz, are chaotic neutral gnome ceremorphs, which are smaller-than-normal mind flayers spawned from gnome hosts. Their crew consists of three gnome squidlings named Rin, Rix, and Zglarrd. See the \"Mind Flayers\" entry in {@adventure appendix C|IDRotF|21} for more information about gnome ceremorphs and squidlings.": "七天前，希望捕获一些有趣的物种进行研究的太空思想传播者在试图驾驶飞船穿越暴风雪时，撞毁了他们的飞船--一艘名为{@i Id Ascendant}的鹦鹉螺。这艘船的船长，沃瑞恩-库奥尔（Vorryn Q'uuol）和德雷达维克斯-辛菲兹（Dredavex Sinfiz），是混乱的中性地精ceremorphs，它们是由地精宿主催生出来的比正常小的心灵传播者。他们的团队由三个地精乌贼组成，分别是林（Rin）、里克斯（Rix）和兹格拉德（Zglarrd）。更多关于地精的脑残粉和乌贼的信息，请参见{@adventure appendix C|IDRotF|21}中的 \"掠夺者 \"条目。",
	"The illithids are stuck unless they can find a {@item psi crystal|IDRotF} (see {@adventure appendix D|IDRotF|22|{@item Psi Crystal|IDRotF}}) to jump-start the ship's propulsion system. Vorryn and Dredavex are expending considerable effort to keep their ship functional and thus cannot conduct the search themselves. They also can't trust the moronic squidlings to accomplish such a delicate task. For these reasons, the gnome ceremorphs need help. They have built a device that can detect the presence of {@item Psi Crystal|IDRotF|psi crystals} in a 5-mile radius but haven't found any. The characters might have harvested a {@item psi crystal|IDRotF} from the gem mine near Termalaine (see \"{@area A Beautiful Mine|24d|x}\"), in which case the gnome ceremorphs would be very interested in acquiring it.": "除非他们能找到一个{@item psi crystal|IDRotF}（见{@adventure appendix D|IDRotF|22|{@item Psi Crystal|IDRotF}}）来启动飞船的推进系统，否则illithids就被困住了。Vorryn和Dredavex正在花费相当大的精力来保持他们的船的功能，因此不能自己进行搜索。他们也不能相信那些低能的乌贼们能完成这样一个棘手的任务。由于这些原因，地精ceremorphs需要帮助。他们制造了一个设备，可以探测到5英里范围内有{@item Psi Crystal|IDRotF|psi crystals}的存在，但没有发现任何东西。这些人物可能在Termalaine附近的宝石矿中收获了一颗{@item psi crystal|IDRotF}（见\"{@area A Beautiful Mine|24d|x}\"），在这种情况下，地精ceremorphs会对获取它非常感兴趣。",
	"Complicating matters is the damage done by the crash to the nautiloid's life support system, for once this system shuts down, the illithids are at risk of freezing to death. If the shutdown occurs before they acquire a {@item psi crystal|IDRotF}, the gnome ceremorphs' back-up plan is to activate the nautiloid's self-destruct system (see {@area area N7|363|x}) before abandoning ship and making their way toward Ten-Towns with the gnome squidlings in tow.": "更加复杂的是坠机对鹦鹉螺号的生命支持系统造成的损害，因为一旦这个系统关闭，illithids就有被冻死的危险。如果在他们获得{@item psi crystal|IDRotF}之前发生关闭，地精ceremorphs的后备计划是启动鹦鹉螺的自毁系统（见{@area area N7|363|x}），然后弃船，在地精乌贼的牵引下向十镇前进。",
	"Vorryn and Dredavex want to leave Icewind Dale and return to the stars they call home with their squidling brood mates and a couple of interesting new creations or discoveries. They retain their gnomish curiosity and love of tinkering, now blended with the illithids' drive for control and experimentation. They are delighted to meet visitors who are willing to help them acquire a {@item psi crystal|IDRotF} or, failing that, help them and the gnome squidlings infiltrate Ten-Towns. In exchange, the {@creature Gnome Ceremorph|IDRotF|gnome ceremorphs} are willing to part with their laser pistols and the magic items in {@area area N9|36c|x}.": "Vorryn和Dredavex想离开冰风谷，带着他们的乌贼伙伴和一些有趣的新创造或发现，回到他们称之为家的星空。他们保留了地精的好奇心和对修补工作的热爱，现在又融合了illithids的控制和实验的动力。他们很高兴遇到愿意帮助他们获得{@item psi crystal|IDRotF}的访客，或者，如果不行的话，帮助他们和地精乌贼们潜入十镇。作为交换，（1%）愿意放弃他们的激光手枪和（2%）的魔法物品。",
	"Unlike most mind flayers, who prefer to communicate using telepathy, Vorryn and Dredavex prefer to speak aloud in Gnomish or Undercommon, with an accent best described as \"gooey.\" Vorryn is persnickety and exasperated most of the time but also has a dry sense of humor. Dredavex is industrious and likes to ease tension by telling crude jokes it has learned from eating goblin brains. If they or any of the gnome squidlings are threatened, the ceremorphs react with deadly intent; otherwise, they shun combat.": "与大多数喜欢用心灵感应进行交流的心灵感应者不同，Vorryn和Dredavex更喜欢用地精语或Undercommon语大声说话，其口音最好描述为 \"粘稠\"。Vorryn在大多数时候都很挑剔和气急败坏，但也有一种干燥的幽默感。Dredavex很勤快，喜欢讲它从吃地精大脑中学到的粗俗笑话来缓解紧张。如果他们或任何地精乌贼受到威胁，ceremorphs会做出致命的反应；否则，他们会回避战斗。",
	"The {@creature Gnome Squidling|IDRotF|gnome squidlings} have a blind hunger for brains that often overrides their common sense.

They have the reasoning and emotional control of toddlers blended with the guile of bored housecats.": "{@creature Gnome Squidling|IDRotF|gnome squidlings}对大脑有一种盲目的饥饿感，这种饥饿感往往压倒了他们的常识。除了这种基本的饥饿感，地精乌贼们不知道自己想要什么。他们有学步儿童的推理和情绪控制能力，与无聊的家猫的狡猾相融合。",
	"Rin, Rix, and Zglarrd make squelching and keening noises when excited or upset; otherwise, they communicate in bursts of emotion punctuated with short, simple words conveyed telepathically. The squidlings trust Vorryn and Dredavex and would be lost without the gnome ceremorphs to watch over them.": "Rin、Rix和Zglarrd在兴奋或不高兴时，会发出压抑和尖锐的声音；否则，他们会用简短的心灵感应来交流情感，并以简单的话语作为点缀。乌贼们信任Vorryn和Dredavex，如果没有地精Ceremorphs照看他们，他们会迷失方向。",
	"After the {@i Id Ascendant} crashed, the gnome ceremorphs activated a distress signal meant to be heard only by creatures that have telepathy, including any character who is attuned to the {@i psi crystal} found in the gem mine outside Termalaine (see \"{@area A Beautiful Mine|24d|x}\"). The signal's technology hasn't been perfected yet, such that nontelepathic creatures have been known to pick up the signal as well. You get to decide whether a nontelepathic creature can sense the signal or not.": "在{@i Id Ascendant}坠毁后，地精族人启动了一个求救信号，该信号只被有心灵感应的生物听到，包括任何与在Termalaine外的宝石矿发现的{@i psi crystal}相适应的角色（见\"{@area A Beautiful Mine|24d|x}\"）。该信号的技术还没有完善，所以非心灵感应的生物也被称为能接收到该信号。你可以决定非心灵感应的生物是否能感应到这个信号。",
	"The signal has a range of 50 miles. Those lucky few who can detect it and set out for the source can feel it guiding them toward the downed nautiloid. The signal is a sequence of words in Deep Speech with a buzzing undertone. Any creature that understands Deep Speech and is sensitive to the signal can translate the message:": "该信号的范围为50英里。那些能够探测到它并开始寻找信号源的少数幸运者可以感觉到它在引导他们走向被击落的鹦鹉螺。该信号是一连串的深层语言词汇，带有嗡嗡的低音。任何能理解深层语言并对信号敏感的生物都能翻译出这个信息。",

The seventh giant, Reggaryarva, is slightly larger than the others and wears a coat of white dragon scales and a magnificent horned helm. Reggaryarva was once called the \"jarl of jarls\" and often had the final say—or axe blow—in any heated discussion. He sits in the throne that faces north, as he should. Beneath Reggaryarva's throne is a vault dedicated to Thrym, the god of the frost giants.": "古老的王座是由石块雕刻而成的。当冰霜巨人的幽灵出现时，他们的眼睛在黑暗中发出白色的光芒。其中三个巨人穿着毛皮背心和皮裤；另外三个从头到脚都穿着链子。第七个巨人，雷加里瓦（Reggaryarva），比其他巨人稍大，穿着白色龙鳞的外套，戴着华丽的角质头盔。雷加里瓦曾被称为 \"领主中的领主\"，在任何激烈的讨论中，他常常有最后的决定权，或者说是斧头的打击。他坐在面向北方的宝座上，这是他应该做的。在雷加里瓦的宝座下有一个拱顶，供奉着冰霜巨人之神泰瑞姆。",

	"Five years ago, before Icewind Dale became the perpetually frozen hellscape it is today, {@creature Spellix Romwod|IDRotF} was traveling through the mountain pass with a small caravan when it was caught in an avalanche. The goblins who triggered the avalanche captured Spellix's mates and dragged them back to their caves in the mountains to be eaten. Spellix, whom the goblins overlooked, followed them and devised a cunning plan to free his companions. Using materials scavenged from the wrecked caravan, he engineered a costume for himself. Disguised as a half-metal goblin, he infiltrated the goblins' lair and did his best to fit in, cleverly using {@spell silent image} spells to hide the imperfections in his disguise. When he was offered a bone to gnaw on, his mechanical goblin mouth malfunctioned and wouldn't stop grinding its teeth. Thus, {@creature Spellix Romwod|IDRotF} came to be known as Yarb-Gnock, which means \"Ever-Gnawing\" in Goblin.": "五年前，在冰风谷成为今天这个永久冰封的地狱景区之前，{@creature Spellix Romwod|IDRotF}与一个小商队一起穿越山口时，被卷入雪崩。引发雪崩的地精抓住了斯佩利克斯的伙伴们，并把他们拖回山中的洞穴吃掉。妖精们忽略了斯佩利克斯，他跟踪了他们，并制定了一个狡猾的计划来解救他的同伴们。他利用从残破的商队中搜出的材料，为自己设计了一套服装。他伪装成一个半金属的妖精，潜入了妖精的巢穴，并尽力融入其中，巧妙地使用{@spell silent image}法术来掩盖他伪装中的缺陷。当有人给他一根骨头让他啃的时候，他的机械地精的嘴出现了故障，不停地磨牙。因此，{@creature Spellix Romwod|IDRotF}被称为Yarb-Gnock，在哥布林语中意为 \"永远的啃食\"。",
	"Spellix was repulsed by the goblins' squalor and took pity on them. Abandoning all concern for his former mates, whom he didn't particularly like anyway, Spellix adopted the name given to him by the goblins and spent the next several months engineering ways to improve their standard of living. Long after the other members of the caravan had been eaten, Yarb-Gnock became the new chief after the previous one choked to death on a mountain goat tongue. By then, Yarb-Gnock had already drawn up plans to build a fortress in the mountains. Karkolohk, the Gnomish word for \"home,\" became the goblin tribe's dream of a better future.": "斯佩利克斯对地精们的肮脏生活感到厌恶，并同情他们。斯佩利克斯放弃了对他以前的伙伴们的关心，反正他也不是特别喜欢他们，他采用了地精们给他起的名字，并在接下来的几个月里想办法提高他们的生活水平。在商队的其他成员被吃掉很久之后，在前任首领被山羊舌头噎死之后，亚尔布-格诺克成为新的首领。那时，亚尔布-格诺克已经制定了在山上建造堡垒的计划。Karkolohk，地精语中的 \"家\"，成为地精部落对美好未来的梦想。",
	"As the goblins were finishing construction of their new home, everlasting winter descended upon Icewind Dale. Fewer caravans made their way through the mountain pass, forcing Chief Yarb-Gnock to send goblin wagons far and wide in search of food and resources. Despite his best efforts, the gnome-in-goblin's-clothing could sense that the tribe was becoming increasingly frustrated. The goblins felt like they were working harder for less, and a few are beginning to suspect that Chief Yarb-Gnock is a fraud.": "当地精们完成了他们新家的建设时，永恒的冬天降临到了冰风谷。通过山口的商队越来越少，迫使首领Yarb-Gnock将地精的马车送到很远的地方去寻找食物和资源。尽管他做出了最大的努力，但身穿地精衣服的地精可以感觉到，这个部落正变得越来越沮丧。妖精们觉得他们工作得更辛苦了，而少数人开始怀疑Yarb-Gnock酋长是个骗子。",
	"Cooped up in the cold with creatures that would kill him if they learned the truth, Chief Yarb-Gnock is running out of ideas to keep the goblins motivated on other tasks and has begun to fear that the goblins are on to him. His costume is beginning to come apart, and paranoia has made him sleep-deprived. The number of \"traitors\" hurled from the mountaintop increases with every cycle of the moon, and the goblins don't know who among them are Yarb-Gnock's loyal spies. Mistrust has infected every nook and cranny of Karkolohk.": "亚尔布-格诺克酋长被关在寒冷的地方，与那些一旦得知真相就会杀了他的生物在一起，他已经没有办法让妖精们继续执行其他任务，并开始担心妖精们会盯上他。他的服装开始散架，偏执狂使他寝食难安。从山顶上扔下的 \"叛徒 \"的数量随着每个月的周期而增加，地精们不知道他们中谁是亚尔布-格诺克的忠实间谍。不信任已经感染了卡科洛赫的每一个角落和缝隙。",
	"{@creature Spellix Romwod|IDRotF} was beginning to think that the time had come to abandon his goblin kin and seek refuge in Ten-Towns when, two days ago, his fortunes improved suddenly. Goblins out scavenging in a wagon stumbled across a curious object in the tundra—a metallic, egg-shaped crate. (This object was jettisoned from an illithid nautiloid soon before it crashed in the mountains to the east, as described in \"{@area Id Ascendant|346|x}\"), Chief Yarb-Gnock thinks the crate might hold something wondrous, and getting it open has become his new obsession.": "{@creature Spellix Romwod|IDRotF}开始认为是时候抛弃他的地精亲属，到十镇寻求庇护了，但两天前，他的命运突然好转。乘坐马车外出拾荒的地精们在苔原上偶然发现了一个奇怪的东西--一个金属的、蛋形的箱子。(这个东西是在一个幻影鹦鹉螺在东边的山里坠毁前不久被抛弃的，如\"{@area Id Ascendant|346|x} \"中所述），Yarb-Gnock首领认为这个箱子里可能有奇妙的东西，而打开它已经成为他新的痴迷。",

Prisoners are kept in dangling cages until they freeze to death, whereupon the goblins cook and eat them.": "卡科洛赫的妖精们经常在连接十镇和更南边的其他定居点的小路上出没，尽管现在很少有人来往。囚犯被关在悬空的笼子里，直到他们被冻死，然后妖精们就把他们煮熟吃掉。",

	"Chief Yarb-Gnock has taught the goblins to seize their destiny and stop at nothing to get what they want. Opportunistic creatures that they are, they take any sign of weakness as an opening to gain an advantage. If bullying and intimidation don't work, the goblins use more underhanded and passive-aggressive tactics. If they think that they are at a disadvantage or that they will come to an unavoidable loss, the goblins will do whatever they can to backtrack out of such a situation, be it through bribery, wheedling, or treachery.": "亚尔布-格诺克酋长教导地精们要抓住自己的命运，不惜一切代价来获得他们想要的东西。他们是机会主义的生物，他们把任何软弱的迹象都当作获得优势的机会。如果欺负和恐吓不起作用，妖精们就会使用更多的暗器和消极的攻击手段。如果他们认为自己处于劣势，或者他们将面临不可避免的损失，地精们会想尽办法从这种情况下倒退出来，无论是通过贿赂、讨好，还是背叛。",
	"Visitors are not welcome at Karkolohk. Moreover, the goblins who live here detest non-goblins, especially gnomes. Were the goblins just a little smarter, they would see through Chief Yarb-Gnock's crude disguise and the magic he uses to hides its imperfections, and tear {@creature Spellix Romwod|IDRotF} limb from limb.": "卡科洛赫克不欢迎游客。此外，住在这里的地精厌恶非地精，尤其是地精。如果地精们稍微聪明一点，他们就会看穿亚尔布-格诺克首领粗糙的伪装和他用来掩盖伪装缺陷的魔法，并将{@creature Spellix Romwod|IDRotF}肢体撕碎。",
	"If you decide to use the \"Peace Out\" quest (see \"{@area Peace Out|287|x}\"), the characters are treated as diplomats by the goblins and permitted to approach and enter the fortress unmolested, provided they do no harm to its inhabitants.

It asserts that the goblins of Karkolohk will refrain from attacking travelers and caravans heading to and from Ten-Towns for as long as the peace treaty between Ten-Towns and Karkolohk lasts, and it bears Yarb-Gnock's signature at the bottom. After handing them the message, Yarb-Gnock urges the characters to leave at once and deliver it to the Council Hall in Bryn Shander.": "如果亚尔布-格诺克的目标是与十镇媾和，那么他就会在用餐结束后给宴会上的人一张卷起来的兔皮条。在这张皮条上，他用普通话写了一份简短的正式通知，致十镇的议长会议。它宣称，只要十镇和卡科洛赫的和平条约还在，卡科洛赫的地精就不会攻击来往于十镇的旅行者和商队，并且在底部有亚尔布-格诺克的签名。亚尔布-格诺克把信息交给他们后，催促他们马上离开，并把信息送到布林山德的议会大厅。",
	"If Yarb-Gnock's goal is to flee Karkolohk, the meal concludes with Yarb-Gnock requesting that the characters escort him to the Council Hall in Bryn Shander.

	"The shield guardian was built by a Netherese wizard and is nearly two thousand years old. Carved into its massive forearms is the wizard's personal sigil. After the wizard's tower crashed, the guardian left the spire to go find help but got buried in an avalanche. It eventually shut down. Centuries later, a band of goblins dug it out and hauled it back to Karkolohk. Unfortunately for them, the guardian could not be reactivated. After some thought, Chief Yarb-Gnock decided to dangle it from this platform, using ropes and pulleys like puppet strings to make the guardian appear animate and terrifying. This construct must have been a lively sight to behold at one point, but the aura of menace surrounding it quickly faded, and the goblins lost all interest in it.": "盾牌守护者是由一位尼瑟斯巫师建造的，有近两千年的历史。在它巨大的前臂上刻着这位巫师的个人标志。巫师的塔楼坠毁后，守护者离开尖塔去寻找帮助，但却被雪崩掩埋。它最终关闭了。几个世纪后，一帮地精把它挖了出来，并把它拖回了卡科洛赫克。不幸的是，他们无法重新启动守护者。经过一番思考，亚尔布-格诺克酋长决定把它吊在这个平台上，用绳索和滑轮像木偶线一样让守护者显得有生命力和可怕。这个构造在某一时刻一定是一个热闹的景象，但围绕着它的威胁的光环很快就消失了，地精们对它完全失去了兴趣。",

	"The goblin healer in the easternmost hut is named Manafek. She also tells fortunes by studying patterns of raven's blood spilled on the snow. She is wise enough to have seen through Chief Yarb-Gnock's disguise and is contemplating whether to blackmail the rock gnome or expose him. She's leaning toward the former, since she's not sure the goblins will pick her as their new leader if Yarb-Gnock dies.": "最东边小屋中的地精治疗师名叫马纳费克。她还通过研究乌鸦血洒在雪地上的图案来算命。她很聪明，看穿了亚尔布-格诺克酋长的伪装，正在考虑是敲诈岩石地精还是揭穿他。她倾向于前者，因为她不确定如果亚尔布-格诺克死了，地精们会不会选择她作为他们的新领袖。",

Ravens have picked the skulls clean.": "每当亚尔布-格诺克酋长想杀一儆百的时候，这个可怜虫就会被尖叫着拖到这条走道上。妖精要么从悬崖上跳下去摔死，要么死在亲属的剑下。这些头骨属于那些从未走到走道尽头的妖精。乌鸦把这些头骨摘得干干净净。",

It knows nothing about {@creature Dzaan|IDRotF}'s fate or the crimes for which the real {@creature Dzaan|IDRotF} was executed.": "看过{@creature Dzaan|IDRotF}火刑的人物（见\"{@area Toil and Trouble|16c|x}\"）认出这个年轻人是{@creature Dzaan|IDRotF}--死而复生，似乎是这样。另一方面，模拟人以前从未见过这些人物。为了赢得他们的信任，它努力做到诚实和坦诚。它有足够的自我意识，知道自己是什么，但它不能以目前的形式成长或学习。它要求人物帮助它成为一个有血有肉的生物，就像创造它的巫师一样。它对{@creature Dzaan|IDRotF}的命运或真正的{@creature Dzaan|IDRotF}被处决的罪行一无所知。",
	"In the course of a conversation, the simulacrum shares the following information:": "在对话过程中，模拟人分享以下信息。",

	"\"On the lowest level of this inverted tower, my creator found a chamber that can turn illusions into reality. The life-spark of a living creature is needed to activate its power. As a creation of snow and shadow, I have no life-spark of my own, and Krintaas, my undead bodyguard, is of no help in this regard. I assure you, the chamber can in no way harm anyone.\"": "\"在这座倒置的塔的最底层，我的创造者发现了一个可以将幻觉变成现实的密室。要激活它的力量，需要一个生物的生命火种。作为雪和影子的创造物，我没有自己的生命火种，而克林塔斯，我的亡灵保镖，在这方面也没有帮助。我向你保证，这个密室不会伤害任何人。\"",

	"This particular {@item shield guardian amulet|IDRotF} is a rare magic item that requires attunement, and only humanoids can attune to it. A humanoid that attunes to the amulet knows the distance and direction of the shield guardian, provided the amulet and the guardian are on the same plane of existence. As an action, the amulet's attuned wearer can try to reactivate the shield guardian, doing so with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check.

The amulet otherwise functions as described in the shield guardian's entry in {@book Monster Manual|MM}.": "这个特别的{@item shield guardian amulet|IDRotF}是一个稀有的魔法物品，需要调和，只有人形生物能调和它。与护身符相合的人知道护身符的距离和方向，只要护身符和护身符在同一个存在平面。作为一项行动，护身符的佩戴者可以尝试重新激活护身符，只要成功进行DC20智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查即可。只有当护身符和守护者在彼此的10英尺范围内时才能尝试重新激活。除此之外，护身符的功能与{@book Monster Manual|MM}中盾牌守护者的条目所述相同。",
	"The simulacrum has been picking through the spire's wreckage and gathering books that might be useful. Characters can find the following readable titles among the stacks of worthless, damaged books on the floor:": "这个模拟人一直在捡拾尖塔的残骸，收集可能有用的书籍。角色们可以在地板上堆积的毫无价值的、损坏的书籍中找到以下可读的书目。",

	"The first time a character who can cast spells touches the symbol of Mystryl carved into the front of the altar, a stoppered flask filled with a luminous blue liquid appears in a shimmer of light \"atop\" the altar and immediately falls, shattering on the ceiling-turned-floor unless someone within reach catches it. Catching the falling flask requires a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. If more than one character succeeds on this save, the one who rolled highest is the one who catches it. If the flask shatters, its contents evaporate instantly. Only one such flask can be created, after which the altar becomes nonmagical.": "当一个可以施法的角色第一次触碰刻在祭坛正面的Mystryl符号时，一个装满蓝色发光液体的塞子瓶就会出现在祭坛的 \"顶部\"，并立即坠落，在天花板变成的地板上碎裂，除非有人能接住它。接住落下的酒瓶需要成功地进行DC 10的灵巧救赎。如果有多个角色成功地进行了这个救赎，那么掷出最高分的人就是接住它的人。如果瓶子碎了，里面的东西就会立刻蒸发掉。只能创造一个这样的酒瓶，之后祭坛就会变得没有魔力。",
	"A character can use an {@spell identify} spell or similar magic to determine the properties of the blue liquid in the flask.

	"The Reghed nomads eke out a meager existence on the desolate tundra of Icewind Dale, yet this is a life to which they are accustomed. Auril's everlasting winter has made hunting and travel more challenging, to be sure, but the tribes are weathering these difficult times by rationing their food and letting nothing go to waste. If anything, the Frostmaiden's cruelty has hardened the nomads' determination to survive. By following herds for their food and occasionally restocking on wood, the Reghed can get by without relying on trade. They shun Ten-Towns and expect to prevail long after those feeble lights of civilization have been snuffed out.": "雷格德游牧民族在冰风谷荒凉的苔原上勉强度日，但这是他们所习惯的生活。奥里尔（Auril）永恒的冬天使狩猎和旅行更具挑战性，这是肯定的，但部落通过配给食物和不让任何东西被浪费来度过这些困难时期。如果说有什么原因的话，那么冰霜女巫的残忍已经使游牧民族的生存决心更加坚定。通过跟随牧群获取食物，偶尔补充木材，雷格德人可以不依赖贸易而生存。他们避开了十镇，并期望在那些微弱的文明之光被扼杀后还能长期存在。",
	"A Reghed camp is a somber and subdued place, except for the barking of sled dogs and the sounds of children playing in the snow. The warriors and hunters like to conserve their strength for when it's needed, preferring to spend their idle hours doing as little as possible. Telling familiar stories and inventing new ones that glorify the nomads' outlook on life are common pastimes (see the \"Reghed Stories\" sidebar), as is sharpening weapons.": "瑞格德的营地是一个阴沉而低调的地方，除了雪橇犬的叫声和孩子们在雪地上玩耍的声音。战士和猎人喜欢保存自己的力量，以备不时之需，宁愿在闲暇时尽可能少做事情。讲述熟悉的故事和编造新的故事来颂扬游牧民族的人生观，是常见的消遣方式（见 \"摄取的故事 \"边栏），磨练武器也是如此。",
	"Food is critical, of course, and certain beasts of the tundra are staples among the Reghed tribes. Knucklehead trout and seals are often prepared for eating very near the scene of the kill, filleted or chopped and generally eaten raw. {@creature Reindeer|IDRotF} meat, on the other hand, must be cooked before consumption. {@creature Reindeer|IDRotF} also provide the Reghed tribes with sinew, bone, and hide, all of which are used in the manufacture of weapons and armor.": "当然，食物是至关重要的，某些苔原上的野兽是雷盖德部落的主食。刀头鳟鱼和海豹通常是在杀戮现场附近准备吃的，切成片或切碎，一般都是生吃。而{@creature Reindeer|IDRotF}肉则必须煮熟后才能食用。{@creature Reindeer|IDRotF}还为雷盖德部落提供筋、骨和皮，所有这些都被用于制造武器和盔甲。",

	"Revel's End is a panopticon, a prison configured in such a way that the activities of the prisoners can be closely monitored from a central location. Situated on the frigid, misty coast of the Sea of Moving Ice, the prison is a single-story structure topped with battlements. Rising from the core of the panopticon is a tower that holds the prison's administrative offices and guard barracks. Both the prison and the tower are carved out of a tall, blade-shaped rock that rises high above the sea cliffs. This rock, called the Windbreak, shields the tower against the brutal winds that sweep down from the Reghed Glacier.": "雷弗的尽头是一座全景监狱，这座监狱的配置方式使囚犯的活动可以从一个中心位置受到密切监视。监狱位于移动冰海的寒冷、迷雾的海岸上，是一个单层结构，顶部有城墙。监狱的核心是一座塔楼，里面有监狱的行政办公室和警卫营房。监狱和塔楼都是由一块高大的刀状岩石雕刻而成，高高耸立在海崖之上。这块岩石被称为 \"防风墙\"，为塔楼挡住了从雷盖德冰川上掠过的残酷的风。",

To be imprisoned in Revel's End, one must have committed a serious crime against one or more members of the alliance and been sentenced to a lengthy period of incarceration (typically a year or more). Moreover, the offender must have political connections that make incarceration in another facility less dependable. Captured spies, for example, are often brought here to cool their heels.": "启示录由领主联盟控制，这是一个松散的定居点联盟，目前的成员包括博德之门、米拉巴尔、永夜、银月、水底和亚尔塔等城市；安菲勒、达格福德和长鞍等城镇；以及矮人的据点米特拉尔厅。要想被囚禁在雷弗尔尽头，必须对联盟的一名或多名成员犯下严重罪行，并被判处长期监禁（通常是一年或更长时间）。此外，犯罪者必须有政治关系，使监禁在另一个设施中不那么可靠。例如，被抓获的间谍经常被带到这里，以冷却他们的脚步。",
	"Each member of the Lords' Alliance assigns one representative to Revel's End, and together they form a parole committee called the Absolution Council. Rarely are all ten council members present, since Revel's End offers little in the way of comfort and amenities.

	"The characters might also come to Revel's End hoping to book passage on a ship, as such vessels are known to bring prisoners and supplies to the prison.

Later carvings focus on wars against the orcs, when the Skytower and Wyrmdoom goliaths were united against a common foe. Carvings made within the past century chronicle the souring of the friendship between the two goliath clans, with scenes showing warriors of Wyrmdoom Crag slaying griffons followed by bloody skirmishes between the goliath clans on mountainsides.

	"If the characters ask about the rune-carved tunnel that burrows under the floor, Demelok tells them that it serves two purposes: to test young goliaths on the cusp of adulthood and to impart the wisdom that comes from knowing one's own character.": "如果人物问起钻在地板下的符文雕刻的隧道，德梅洛克告诉他们，它有两个作用：测试即将成年的年轻巨人，以及传授了解自己性格后的智慧。",
	"After learning the lessons needed to become full-fledged adults, a young goliath offers up a symbol of their childhood—a doll—and crawls through the tunnel. Members of their family wait for them on the other side, ready to welcome them into adulthood. The visions seen by those who crawl through the tunnel force them to face their fears, experience what it means to be truly alone, and recognize their own weaknesses. Not everyone has the fortitude to make it through the tunnel on the first attempt, but those who fail can try again.": "在学习了成为成熟的成年人所需的课程后，一个年轻的高丽人献出了他们童年的象征--洋娃娃，并爬过了隧道。他们的家庭成员在另一边等待着他们，准备迎接他们进入成年。那些爬过隧道的人看到的幻象迫使他们面对自己的恐惧，体验什么是真正的孤独，并认识到自己的弱点。不是每个人都有毅力在第一次尝试时就能通过隧道，但那些失败者可以再次尝试。",
	"Visitors who want to experience this trial are warned that it is not for the faint of heart. A character who reaches the tunnel's midpoint must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw and a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If either save fails, the character is unable to move forward and must withdraw the way they came. If both saves fail, the character is so overwhelmed by visions of terror that they fall into a coma, becoming {@condition unconscious} for {@dice 4d6} hours. A character who succeeds on both saving throws can crawl through the tunnel and out the other side, having confronted the visions and overcome them.": "想体验这个试验的游客被警告说，胆小的人是不适合的。到达隧道中点的角色必须在DC15宪法救赎和DC15魅力救赎中取得成功。如果任何一次救赎失败，该角色将无法继续前进，必须从原路返回。如果两次救赎都失败了，角色就会被恐怖的幻觉所淹没，从而陷入昏迷，在1%的时间内变成{@condition unconscious}。两次救赎都成功的角色可以爬过隧道并从另一边出来，因为他已经面对了幻觉并克服了它们。",
	"Any character who gets Chief Ogolai's consent to crawl through the tunnel is considered an honorary member of the Thuunlakalaga clan if they pass the trial.": "任何得到奥戈莱酋长同意爬过隧道的角色，如果通过了试验，就会被认为是图恩拉卡拉加部族的荣誉成员。",
	"This cavern has a domed roof thirty feet high and an open well in the middle of the floor. Two youthful goliaths use ropes and a bucket to draw water from the well while six adults wrangle a handful of exuberant goliath toddlers.": "这个洞穴有一个30英尺高的圆顶，地板中间有一口开放的井。两个年轻的巨人用绳索和水桶从井里打水，而六个成年人则管理着一小撮兴高采烈的巨人幼儿。",
	"Rough-hewn stairs ascend to the southern part of the cave, where the floor is ten feet higher. Seated in this area next to a crackling fire is a female goliath with gray hair, many scars, and a white cloak made of mountain goat hide. Leaning against the wall behind her is a greataxe with a bone haft. She gnaws on a pipe as she tries to settle a dispute between two goliath children.": "粗糙的楼梯上升到洞穴的南部，那里的地板高出10英尺。在这个区域里，坐在噼啪作响的火堆旁的是一位女性巨人，她头发灰白，身上有许多伤痕，穿着山羊皮制成的白色斗篷。靠在她身后的墙上的是一把带骨柄的大斧头。她一边啃着烟斗，一边试图解决两个歌利亚孩子之间的争端。",

	"Ogolai greets new arrivals and invites them to join her by the fire. If she takes a shine to them, she walks them back to the feasting cave ({@area area W7|456|x}) for a hot meal. If she is asked why the Skytower and Wyrmdoom goliaths don't get along, Ogolai says:": "奥戈莱欢迎新来的人，并邀请他们加入她的火堆。如果她对他们有好感，她会带他们回到宴席洞（{@area area W7|456|x}）吃一顿热饭。如果有人问她为什么天塔和Wyrmdoom的巨人不能相处，Ogolai说。",
	"\"Many summers ago, the children of Wyrmdoom challenged the children of Skytower to a game of goat-ball. During the game, the ball tumbled near one of the griffons of Skytower. When one of our children tried to fetch the ball, the griffon went berserk and grievously wounded her. The game was called off. Hungry for more of the child's flesh, the griffon haunted Wyrmdoom for days. Our hunters were forced to kill it to protect the child. The two clans have been opposed ever since.\"": "\"许多年前的夏天，Wyrmdoom的孩子们向Skytower的孩子们挑战，玩起了山羊球。在比赛中，球在天塔的一只狮鹫附近翻滚。当我们的一个孩子试图去捡球时，那只狮鹫发狂了，把她打成重伤。游戏被取消了。由于渴望得到更多孩子的肉体，这只狮鹫在Wyrmdoom徘徊了好几天。我们的猎人被迫杀死它以保护这个孩子。从那时起，这两个部族就一直处于敌对状态。\"",
	"Although she doesn't say so, Ogolai is the child who was wounded by the griffon, as the scars on her face suggest. To this day, she fears griffons and blames the Skytower goliaths for not keeping theirs under control.": "虽然她没有说，但奥戈莱是被狮鹫打伤的孩子，她脸上的伤疤表明了这一点。时至今日，她仍然惧怕狮鹫，并指责天塔的狮鹫没有控制好它们。",
	"If the characters claim to be neutral arbiters seeking to end the conflict between the clans, Ogolai says she's prepared to meet with Arn Akannathi, the leader of the Skytower goliaths, but refuses to meet him at Skytower Shelter. Ogolai insists that the meeting occur on the goat-ball court at Wyrmdoom Crag, which she knows Arn will never agree to. Ogolai's refusal to conduct negotiations at Skytower Shelter stems from her deep-seeded fear of griffons, though she would never admit to this fact lest she appear weak. Ogolai is not interested in offering any goodwill gesture to Arn, whom she bluntly calls a \"walking stillborn.\"": "如果这些人物声称自己是寻求结束部族间冲突的中立仲裁者，奥戈莱说她准备与天塔巨人的首领阿恩-阿坎纳提会面，但拒绝在天塔庇护所与他会面。Ogolai坚持要在Wyrmdoom Crag的山羊球球场进行会面，她知道阿恩绝不会同意。Ogolai拒绝在Skytower Shelter进行谈判，是因为她对狮鹫的恐惧根深蒂固，尽管她从不承认这一事实，以免她显得软弱。Ogolai对向阿恩提供任何善意的姿态都不感兴趣，她直截了当地称阿恩是一个 \"会走路的死胎\"。",
	"If the characters establish a rapport with Ogolai, she tells them that one of her clan's warriors, a young male named Kapanuk, got separated from his hunting party during a blizzard a few days ago. Ogolai asks only that the characters keep an eye out for him as they travel through the mountains. (The characters might locate Kapanuk in {@area area X28|4bc|x} of Xardorok's fortress in {@adventure chapter 3|IDRotF|13}.)": "如果人物与奥戈莱建立了良好的关系，她会告诉他们，她部族的一个战士，一个名叫卡帕努克的年轻男子，几天前在暴风雪中与他的狩猎队走散了。奥戈莱只要求人物在穿越山区时留意他。(人物可能会在Xardorok的堡垒的{@area area X28|4bc|x}处找到Kapanuk。",

Sikki-kree crashed in the mountains when she was caught in a blizzard and was rescued by goliath hunters. Aruk has been nursing the aarakocra back to health, but he can do only so much. Although Sikki-kree's minor wounds have healed, she has a broken wing that requires at least 10 hit points of magical healing to be mended. The goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag have no such magic at their disposal.

	"Once Sikki-kree can fly again, she thanks the characters for their help before getting Ogolai's permission to depart.

	"The characters are more likely to survive an invasion of Xardorok's fortress if they are at least 4th level. Characters of lower level can succeed if they take frequent rests or have an edge, such as plenty of healing magic or allies to back them up.": "如果角色的等级至少在4级以上，他们更有可能在入侵Xardorok的堡垒中幸存下来。等级较低的角色如果经常休息或有优势，比如有大量的治疗魔法或盟友支持他们，就能成功。",
	"If the characters lack incentive to confront Xardorok in his fortress, either because they didn't encounter his sons in {@adventure chapter 1|IDRotF|1} or because the duergar threat hasn't impacted them yet, you can have one of the speakers in Ten-Towns invite them to a private meeting. The speaker would know the characters by reputation, if nothing else. At this meeting, the speaker presents the following information:": "如果人物缺乏在Xardorok的堡垒中对抗他的动机，要么是因为他们没有在{@adventure chapter 1|IDRotF|1}遇到他的儿子们，要么是因为duergar的威胁还没有影响到他们，你可以让Ten-Towns的一个发言人邀请他们参加一次私人会议。如果不出意外的话，这位发言人会通过声誉认识这些人物。在这次会议上，发言人会介绍以下信息。",

Any character who casts a {@spell speak with dead} spell on the dead duergar can validate the information that the speaker has already imparted.": "如果人物要求与被俘的精灵对话，说话者会告诉他们，精灵在被审讯后被处死，以防止他逃跑并警告他的亲属。如果角色们坚持要见杜尔加，说话者就会把他们带到一个存放尸体的地窖里。任何对死去的精灵施展{@spell speak with dead}法术的角色都可以验证说话者已经传授的信息。",
	"The speaker has little to offer the characters as recompense beyond hospitality and friendship. If the characters insist on a more tangible reward, the speaker scowls, apologizes for misjudging them, and lets them go about their business. Their reputation takes a blow if they decline to help.

	"The following sections describe what the characters are up against in this chapter.": "以下章节描述了本章中人物所面临的情况。",
	"Xardorok's obsession with chardalyn is a form of madness that has consumed the duergar warlock, to the extent that he will stop at nothing to obtain all of it. Xardorok prizes chardalyn more than he loves his sons and his clan, which has alienated his closest advisors and forced them to question their blind obedience to him.": "Xardorok对Chardalyn的痴迷是一种疯狂的形式，它已经吞噬了这个duergar术士，以至于他将不惜一切代价来获得所有的东西。Xardorok对Chardalyn的珍视超过了他对儿子和家族的爱，这使他最亲密的顾问们感到疏远，并迫使他们质疑对他的盲目服从。",
	"Prolonged contact with malevolent magic suffusing the chardalyn has made Xardorok extraordinarily paranoid. He keeps his two sons, Durth and Nildar, as far away from him as possible, sending them on dangerous missions to acquire more chardalyn in and around Ten-Towns, fearing that they might usurp his throne otherwise. Xardorok rewards his subjects for spying on one another and uncovering plots against him. The duergar closest to him are aware of the changes in his demeanor, but they lack the courage to stand up to him. A few have learned to capitalize on his paranoia, gaining Xardorok's favor by fabricating evidence of coups orchestrated by their rivals.": "长期与充斥在chardalyn中的邪恶魔法接触，使Xardorok变得异常偏执。他让他的两个儿子Durth和Nildar离他越远越好，让他们执行危险的任务，在Ten-Towns及其周围获取更多的chardalyn，担心他们会篡夺他的王位。Xardorok奖励他的臣民，因为他们互相刺探并揭露了针对他的阴谋。与他最亲近的杜尔加人意识到了他举止的变化，但他们缺乏勇气站出来反对他。有几个人学会了利用他的偏执狂，通过捏造对手策划的政变证据来获得夏多禄的青睐。",
	"{@creature Grandolpha Muzgardt|IDRotF}, the grand dame of the Muzgardt duergar clan, has recently arrived at the fortress after being invited here by Xardorok. The Muzgardts are based in Gracklstugh, a duergar city in the Underdark. They mass-produce and distribute a filthy duergar ale made from mushrooms. Xardorok has been eager to take a fourth wife and has had his eye on {@creature Grandolpha Muzgardt|IDRotF} for many years. He asked Grandolpha to his fortress to give her a gift—a pseudodragon made of chardalyn (a pseudo-pseudodragon, if you will)—and make her an offer she can't refuse. Once he conquers Icewind Dale, he wants the Muzgardts to control the ale trade throughout his sunless surface kingdom.": "{@creature Grandolpha Muzgardt|IDRotF}，Muzgardt duergar氏族的大夫人，在被Xardorok邀请到这里之后，最近来到了要塞。穆兹加德家族的总部设在地下城的杜尔加城市格拉克斯图（Gracklstugh）。他们大量生产和销售一种由蘑菇制成的肮脏的杜尔加啤酒。Xardorok一直渴望娶到第四个妻子，多年来一直盯着{@creature Grandolpha Muzgardt|IDRotF}。他把格兰道尔法请到他的堡垒，送给她一份礼物--由查尔达林制成的假龙（如果你愿意的话，就是假的假龙）--并向她提出一个她无法拒绝的条件。一旦他征服了冰风谷，他想让穆兹加德家族控制整个他的无阳光表面王国的麦酒贸易。",
	"Grandolpha, for her part, is too canny and jaded to fall for Xardorok's blunt attempt at seduction. She has begun plotting with disenfranchised advisors and warriors in his ranks to overthrow him when the moment is right. Ironically, despite his paranoia, Xardorok is too blinded by his admiration for Grandolpha to foresee her treachery. In Grandolpha, the characters might find an unlikely (if temporary) ally.": "格兰多法，就她而言，太狡猾了，也太迟钝了，不会被夏多禄直截了当的诱惑所迷惑。她已经开始与他队伍中被剥夺权利的顾问和战士们密谋，准备在时机成熟时推翻他。具有讽刺意味的是，尽管Xardorok有妄想症，但他被对Grandolpha的仰慕蒙蔽了双眼，没有预见到她的背叛。在格兰道尔法，这些人物可能会找到一个不太可能的（如果是暂时的）盟友。",

	"Angajuk can travel up to 25 miles a day but takes a leisurely, meandering route to Auril's island, resulting in a three-day journey. The whale is submerged for most of the trip, allowing the characters to see what life is like in the frigid depths. Like a tour guide, the whale takes its passengers within sight of spectacular underwater attractions, including shipwrecks, storm giant castles, and cyclopean ruins from the bygone empire of giants known as Ostoria.": "安加茹克每天最多可以行驶25英里，但前往欧里尔岛的路线却很悠闲，蜿蜒曲折，因此需要三天的时间。鲸鱼在旅行的大部分时间里都被淹没，让人物看到了冰冷的深海中的生活。鲸鱼就像一个导游，带着它的乘客看到壮观的水下景点，包括沉船、暴风雨中的巨型城堡，以及被称为奥斯托利亚的巨人帝国的独眼巨人遗迹。",
	"After delivering the characters safely to the island, Angajuk is willing to circle the island until the characters are ready to leave, provided they don't make the whale wait for too long. Auril's roc poses a threat to Angajuk, so the whale surfaces only when it must.": "在把人物安全送到岛上后，安加茹克愿意在岛上转悠，直到人物准备好离开，前提是他们不要让鲸鱼等太久。奥里尔的大鹏鸟对安加茹克构成了威胁，所以鲸鱼只有在必要时才会浮出水面。",
	"The prison of Revel's End has easy access to the Sea of Moving Ice. On the downside, captains who are brave enough to take their ships into the Sea of Moving Ice expect to be well compensated; characters can expect to pay 1,000 gp or more for a one-way trip to Auril's island, or five times that amount if they expect the ship to wait for them and take them back to Revel's End.": "启示录的监狱可以很容易地进入移动的冰海。勇敢地把船开进移动冰海的船长希望得到很好的补偿；人物可以期望为去奥里尔岛的单程旅行支付1000金币或更多，如果他们希望船等他们并把他们送回雷弗尔尽头，则需要支付5倍的金额。",

	"Regardless of the means by which the characters travel to the island, assume that they arrive near the ruined dock on the island's southeast arm. This puts them on the far side of the island from where the wizard Nass Lantomir met her doom.": "无论人物通过何种方式来到岛上，都要假设他们到达了岛上东南臂的废墟码头附近。这使他们处于岛屿的远端，即巫师娜斯-兰托米尔遭遇厄运的地方。",

	"Characters flying on the backs of griffons can bypass the dock and find somewhere else on the island to land. But if one or more griffons come within 200 feet of the fortress of Grimskalle while Auril's {@creature roc} is atop the fortress, it takes to the air and tries to kill the griffons so that their riders fall.

	"Söpo enjoys watching other creatures suffer. Initially, however, it acts as a guide to earn the characters' trust, pointing out areas where characters might slip on a patch of ice or get bonked on the head by a low-hanging icicle. Vellynne's snowy owl familiar, if it's present, senses the mephit's cruel intent. Söpo and the owl have an instant dislike for one another.": "Söpo喜欢看其他生物受苦。然而，一开始，它充当向导来赢得角色的信任，指出角色可能滑倒在一块冰上或被低垂的冰柱砸中头部的地方。薇琳熟悉的雪地猫头鹰，如果它在场的话，会感觉到梅菲特的残酷意图。Söpo和猫头鹰立即对彼此产生了厌恶。",

	"The party members don't need to help the nomads tear down the camp or set up a new one, but they must accompany the nomads on their journey and endure the same hardship. The trip is a grueling march across the tundra with the wind against them the whole time.

	"A demilich is what becomes of a lich that neglects to feed souls into its phylactery, and Iriolarthas's phylactery has been empty for nearly two thousand years, buried under the rubble of Ythryn far from the demilich's reach.

The same is true of invasive NPCs such as members of the Arcane Brotherhood. A party can fool the demilich into thinking they belong in Ythryn by succeeding on a DC 13 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) group check. If the group check is successful, Iriolarthas believes the party is what it pretends to be; on a failed group check, the demilich sees through the party's deception and becomes hostile toward the characters. If the demilich thinks that the characters are rescuers, given how they appear and act, it follows them around until something happens to change its mind.": "当遇到新来的人时，demilich会认为他们是来自另一个Netherese飞地的救援者，并观察他们做什么。demilich没有通讯手段，也不能用心灵感应与之联系，所以它在沉默中判断新来的人。观察Iriolarthas并成功通过DC13智慧({@skill Insight})检查的角色可以确定demilich正在密切关注他们，看他们对周围环境的反应。如果demilich根据它的观察得出结论，这些角色不是来自另一个Netherese飞地的救援队，它就会试图在他们偷取Ythryn的任何秘密之前摧毁他们。侵入性的NPC也是如此，比如奥术兄弟会的成员。队伍可以通过DC13魅力（{@skill Deception}）团体检查成功来愚弄demilich，让它以为自己属于Ythryn。如果团体检定成功，伊里欧拉塔斯就会相信队伍是它所假装的那样；如果团体检定失败，迪米利希就会看穿队伍的欺骗，并对角色产生敌意。如果demilich认为这些角色是救援者，鉴于他们的外表和行为，它就会一直跟着他们，直到发生一些事情改变它的想法。",

After many fruitless excavations, they found a large stone spindle bearing strange sigils at the bottom of the Sea of Moving Ice and brought it back to Ythryn for study in the fall of −343 DR, the Year of Chilled Marrow. During one of their experiments, something went wrong—a flash of power from the spindle caused the {@i Ythryn} {@i mythallar} to shut down, which in turn caused the city to fall out of the sky and crash into the ice below.": "在使用{@item Ythryn mythallar|IDRotF}(见{@adventure appendix D|IDRotF|22|{@item Ythryn Mythallar|IDRotF}})将Ythryn的飞地升上天空之后，Iriolarthas和他的学徒们前往冰封的北方，寻找Ostoria的遗迹，一个由挥舞着魔法的巨人组成的已逝帝国，在四万年前与龙展开了战争。经过多次无果的挖掘，他们在移动的冰海底部发现了一个带有奇怪符号的大石锭，并在-343 DR的秋天，即冰冷的骨髓年，将其带回了Ythryn进行研究。在他们的一次实验中，出了点问题--纺锤的闪光导致{@i Ythryn}{@i mythallar}关闭，这反过来又导致城市从空中坠落，坠入冰层之下。",
	"Some of those inside tried to flee Ythryn, but glacial ice blocked all conventional routes of escape, and attempts to leave by magic were thwarted by a troublesome intercessor: the mysterious spindle in Iriolarthas's citadel was still putting out magical pulses of energy to hinder spellcasting. By the time this disruption stopped some fifty years later, fear and madness had warped the minds of the apprentice mages, transforming them into nothics. Meanwhile, Iriolarthas grew increasingly feeble until, finally, the lich's skeletal body turned to dust.": "里面的一些人试图逃离Ythryn，但冰川阻挡了所有常规的逃生路线，而试图通过魔法离开的行为也被一个麻烦的干扰者挫败了：Iriolarthas城堡中的神秘主轴仍然在放出魔法能量脉冲，阻碍了施法。大约五十年后，当这种干扰停止时，恐惧和疯狂已经扭曲了法师学徒的思想，将他们变成了无名氏。与此同时，伊利奥拉塔斯变得越来越虚弱，直到最后，这个巫师的骷髅身体变成了灰尘。",

	"Despite their great power, the Netherese faced a growing threat. Under the heart of their empire lived spellcasting aberrations called phaerimm. Using their ability to drain magic, the phaerimm began to unravel the Weave, without which Netheril would collapse into ruin. In −339 DR, four years after the fall of Ythryn, the empire's most powerful arcanist, Karsus, attempted to neutralize the phaerimm threat by casting a spell of unparalleled power that would enable him to replace Mystryl as the god of magic, giving him absolute control over the Weave. Mystryl countered Karsus at a key moment during the casting of the spell, a feat she could accomplish only by sacrificing herself and tearing the Weave. Karsus was slain instantly, and for a time thereafter, most of the creatures of the world were either without magic or simply unable to control it.": "尽管他们拥有强大的力量，尼瑟斯人却面临着一个日益增长的威胁。在他们帝国的中心地带，住着被称为phaerimm的施法反常者。利用他们消耗魔法的能力，phaerimm开始解开织网，没有织网，尼瑟尔就会崩溃，变成废墟。在-339 DR，也就是Ythryn陷落的四年后，帝国最强大的奥术师Karsus试图通过施放一个无与伦比的咒语来消除phaerimm的威胁，这将使他能够取代Mystryl成为魔法之神，使他能够绝对控制编织网。在施法的关键时刻，Mystryl反击了Karsus，她只有通过牺牲自己和撕裂织网才能完成这一壮举。卡萨斯当场被杀，此后的一段时间里，世界上的大多数生物要么没有魔法，要么根本无法控制它。",
	"Without great magic to keep them aloft, the remaining flying cities of Netheril crashed to the ground, and many arcanists who survived were driven mad. Once magic came back into use, Netherese arcanists could no longer cast their mightiest spells as they had before, forcing them to resort to traditional wizardry. Four hundred years after Karsus cast his spell, the Netherese empire was no more—crushed by its enemies and undone by its own hubris.": "没有伟大的魔法来维持它们的飞行，尼瑟尔剩下的飞行城市坠落到地面，许多幸存的奥术师被逼疯了。一旦魔法重新开始使用，尼瑟尔的奥术师就不能再像以前那样施展他们最强大的法术，迫使他们求助于传统的巫术。在Karsus施法的四百年后，尼瑟斯帝国不再存在--被它的敌人击溃，被它自己的狂妄所毁灭。",
	"In the Forgotten Realms, Netheril is the definitive lost empire. It rose to unparalleled heights but eventually fell into ruin. If you've ever played a science fiction game that includes the concept of a lost, highly advanced civilization, then you can begin to imagine what ancient Netheril must have been like. Out of this empire came many of the fearsome monsters, bizarre dungeons, and wondrous magic items found in Faerûn today.": "在《被遗忘的领域》中，尼瑟尔是一个绝对的失落帝国。它上升到了无与伦比的高度，但最终却落入了废墟。如果你曾经玩过一个科幻游戏，其中包括一个失落的、高度先进的文明的概念，那么你就可以开始想象古代尼瑟尔一定是什么样子。从这个帝国中诞生了许多今天在Faerûn发现的可怕的怪物、怪异的地牢和奇妙的魔法物品。",

It might take months, but the hungry tarrasque eventually makes its way southward through the mountain pass, imperiling the rest of the Sword Coast, if nothing is done to curtail its rampage.": "如果在Ythryn被召唤出来，{@creature tarrasque}会摧毁眼前的一切，然后砸开饥饿洞穴，继续在冰风谷横冲直撞，不可避免地将十镇置于危险之中。南边的山，北边和西边的海，以及东边高耸的冰川，都能暂时遏制住塔拉斯克。极端的寒冷也使这种生物昏昏欲睡。这可能需要几个月的时间，但饥饿的龙卷风最终会通过山口向南移动，如果不采取任何措施来遏制它的横行，就会危及剑海岸的其他地区。",
	"If summoned on Auril's island, the tarrasque is trapped there by the deep, churning Sea of Moving Ice.

The characters won't have to deal with her again in their lifetimes unless they continue meddling in her followers' affairs.": "奥里尔的死亡是暂时的，因为一个拥有凡人崇拜者的神不可能真正死亡。当冰霜少女在下一个冬至复活时，她拥有所有的神力。但她倾向于从这个世界上撤退，不允许自己再一次受到凡人的威胁。除非他们继续插手她的追随者的事务，否则人物在他们的一生中不会再与她打交道。",
	"Characters who help rebuild Ten-Towns might be asked to take up the mantle of speaker in one or more communities, replacing leaders who were killed during the adventure.

	"If the characters don't stop Auril, her everlasting winter becomes unendurable to most of Icewind Dale's inhabitants. The hostile climate and the scarcity of food force indigenous creatures to migrate southward or die. As go the {@creature reindeer|IDRotF}, so go the Reghed tribesfolk. In time, even the lakes freeze solid, depriving Ten-Towners of the knucklehead trout upon which their survival depends. Within a year or two, Icewind Dale becomes a gods-forsaken wasteland as cold as Stygia. The bitter cold allows Levistus to open portals between Icewind Dale and the sixth layer of the Nine Hells, from which come forth ice devils under the archdevil's command.

	"If the characters use Iriolarthas's {@item staff of power} to activate the obelisk in Ythryn, they inadvertently reset the world to a time predating the fall of Ythryn and the end of Netheril. The obelisk has sent them back to the spring of −343 DR, the Year of Chilled Marrow, six months prior to the catastrophe that causes Ythryn's fall and another four years before Netheril's demise. The characters find themselves high in the sky over Icewind Dale.

	"The obelisk is gone, leaving an indentation in the ground where it once stood. In its place is an aarakocra with brilliantly colored plumage.

Now, history can be rewritten.\"": "方尖碑不见了，在它曾经站立的地方留下了一个凹痕。取而代之的是一个有着绚丽色彩的羽毛的arakocra。它使用心灵感应，依次向你们每个人伸出手，介绍自己是内卡利。\"它说：\"我从一个早已被遗忘的职责中释放出来。\"世界已经倒退了一千五百多年。现在，历史可以被改写了。\"",
	"The city is no longer trapped deep beneath the Reghed Glacier. Instead, it drifts among the clouds, its spires and other structures agleam and undamaged.

	"Weaving between the city's spires are boulevards traversed by tall humans of noble bearing in wizardly robes, many of them accompanied by hairless, green-skinned humanoids that serve as their valets and bodyguards. Some take note of your presence, while others gawk at the empty space where the obelisk once stood.": "在城市的尖顶之间穿梭着林荫道，身着巫师长袍的高大人类穿行其间，他们中的许多人身边都有没有头发、绿色皮肤的人形生物，作为他们的侍从和保镖。有些人注意到了你的存在，而其他人则目不转睛地看着方尖碑曾经矗立的空地。",
	"Necalli, a {@creature couatl} shapechanged into the form of an aarakocra, doesn't remember why it was bound to the obelisk or by whom. It knows only that it is free of its obligation to the obelisk's builders.

Necalli can administer healing to wounded characters, after which it assumes its true form and departs. It takes no action that might harm another creature.": "Necalli，一个{@creature couatl}被改变成arakocra的形状，不记得它为什么被绑在方尖碑上，也不记得被谁绑。它只知道自己已经摆脱了对方尖碑建造者的义务。它竭力让人物相信，方尖碑已经永远消失了，连同近两千年的历史。Necalli可以为受伤的角色提供治疗，之后它就会变成自己的真实形态并离开。它不会采取任何可能伤害其他生物的行动。",
	"The obelisk is gone, erased from history, leaving the characters stranded. They are now stuck in −343 DR. If the characters warn Iriolarthas about the fate that awaits Ythryn and recount the circumstances leading to its fall, the lich takes steps to ensure that history does not repeat itself, including but not limited to keeping Ostorian relics away from the {@item Ythryn mythallar|IDRotF}. In exchange for their information, Iriolarthas gives the characters a skycoach to expedite their departure from the city. Characters who flee rather than allow themselves to be detained can commandeer a skycoach and plot a course away from the city. A skycoach has the statistics of an {@item airship} (see the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}), but its magic wanes quickly unless it's recharged using magic foreign to the characters. Soon, the skycoach struggles to remain aloft, forcing the characters to set down and salvage what they can from the vessel.": "方尖碑消失了，从历史中抹去了，留下了这些人物被困在这里。他们现在被困在-343 DR。如果角色们警告Iriolarthas等待Ythryn的命运，并讲述了导致它倒下的情况，那么巫师会采取措施确保历史不会重演，包括但不限于让Ostorian遗物远离{@item Ythryn mythallar|IDRotF}。作为对他们信息的交换，Iriolarthas给了这些角色一辆空中客车，以加快他们离开城市的速度。逃离而不是让自己被扣留的角色可以征用一辆空中客车，并制定一个远离城市的路线。空中客车拥有{@item airship}的统计数据（见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}），但它的魔力很快就会减弱，除非使用对角色来说陌生的魔法来充能。很快，空中客车就难以保持在高空，迫使角色们坐下来，从船上打捞出他们能打捞的东西。",
	"To put it mildly, the characters have a whole new world to explore. Ten-Towns doesn't exist in this timeline, nor do most of the cities along the Sword Coast that characters might recognize. Many tribes of Reghed nomads prowl Icewind Dale, while Uthgardt tribes descended from Netherese claim vast tracts of untamed land south of the Spine of the World, kept in check by marauding monsters. The Empire of Netheril controls the lush, temperate lands doomed to become the desert of Anauroch. The town of Illusk (still centuries away from becoming Luskan) surrounds the brooding Hosttower of the Arcane. Characters hoping to visit some past version of Waterdeep or Neverwinter find nothing but unsettled land surrounded by the remnants of the elven kingdom of Illefarn. Humans won't begin farming the plateau above Deepwater Harbor (the future site of Waterdeep) or building the settlement of Eigersstor (later renamed Neverwinter) for another three centuries.": "说白了，人物有一个全新的世界需要探索。在这条时间线中，十镇并不存在，角色们可能认识的剑海岸上的大多数城市也不存在。许多Reghed游牧部落在冰风谷游荡，而Netherese后裔的Uthgardt部落在世界之脊以南拥有大片未被驯服的土地，被掠夺的怪物所控制。尼瑟尔帝国控制着郁郁葱葱的温带土地，注定要成为阿诺罗奇的沙漠。伊鲁斯克（Illusk）镇（距离成为卢斯坎（Luskan）还有几个世纪）围绕着忧郁的奥术师主塔。希望访问某个过去版本的沃特迪普（Waterdeep）或永冬（Neverwinter）的角色，除了被伊尔法恩（Illefarn）精灵王国的残余物所包围的不平静的土地之外，什么都没有。人类要再过三个世纪才会开始在深水港（未来的沃特德普所在地）的高原上耕种，或者建造艾格斯托尔（Eigersstor）的定居点（后来改名为永冬）。",
	"To run a campaign set in this earlier time frame, you will need to delve into earlier products tied to the Forgotten Realms to get the lay of the land circa–343 DR. Of course, once the characters move beyond the strongholds of civilization, the Realms of the past is very much like the Realms of the present—a land of mystery, with old ruins and lost dungeons waiting to be explored. Only now the characters are poised to witness the inevitable fall of Netheril, or find a way to stop it.": "要在这个较早的时间框架内开展活动，你需要深入研究与被遗忘的领域有关的早期产品，以了解公元前343年左右的土地情况。当然，一旦角色超越了文明的堡垒，过去的王国就和现在的王国非常相似--一片神秘的土地，有古老的遗迹和失落的地牢等待着他们去探索。只是现在人物准备见证Netheril不可避免的衰落，或者找到阻止它的方法。",
	"I'm a scion of the Alagondar bloodline and the only known heir to the crown of Neverwinter. If Dagult Neverember, the city's lord-regent, learns that I'm alive, he'll send assassins to kill me.": "我是Alagondar血统的后代，也是永夜城唯一已知的王位继承人。如果城市的统治者Dagult Neverember知道我还活着，他就会派刺客来杀我。",

	"I was brought here from another world by spacefaring mind flayers. The ship in which I was imprisoned crashed in the mountains south of Ten-Towns.

I fear some of my captors also survived the crash and might come looking for me.": "我是从另一个世界被太空中的思想传播者带到这里的。囚禁我的飞船在Ten-Towns南部的山区坠毁了。坠毁后，我在穿越苔原到达十镇时几乎被冻死了。如果不是一些友好的捕猎者发现了我，我就会丧命。我担心我的一些俘虏也在坠机中幸存下来，可能会来找我。",

	"As an action, I can use the stone to summon the spirit of an orc warrior, which appears within 30 feet of me.

	"The Arcane Brotherhood is a cabal of powerful wizards that operates out of the Hosttower of the Arcane, a multi-spired structure that towers above Luskan (a city south of Icewind Dale on the Sword Coast).

Every year, scores of wizards from across Faerûn flock to the Hosttower of the Arcane, hoping to gain admittance into the prestigious ranks of the brotherhood. Nearly all candidates are dismissed out of hand, without so much as a test, feeding rumors that the brotherhood's leaders are more interested in marketing their own brand of exclusivity than finding new talent. Yet wizards seem willing to debase themselves regardless, for admittance to the brotherhood grants access to the Hosttower's incredible libraries of magical lore.": "奥术师兄弟会是一个由强大的巫师组成的阴谋集团，在奥术师的主塔中运作，主塔是一个耸立在卢斯坎（剑海岸冰风谷南部的一个城市）之上的多重风格的建筑。兄弟会的领导层由五位著名的大法师组成，他们亲自挑选其他成员，偏爱有巨大成就的巫师。每年，来自法鲁恩各地的数十名巫师都会涌向奥术之塔，希望能进入兄弟会的著名行列。几乎所有的候选人都被直接开除了，甚至连测试都没有，这就助长了一些谣言，说兄弟会的领导人对推销他们自己的独家品牌比寻找新人才更感兴趣。然而，无论如何，巫师们似乎都愿意贬低自己，因为加入兄弟会就可以进入Hosttower不可思议的魔法传说图书馆。",
	"The truth behind the brotherhood's ongoing quest for new members is based on the adage, \"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.\" The brotherhood's leaders seek out wizards who might by their exploits compete with the brotherhood's acquisition and hoarding of arcane lore and magical secrets. By bringing these wizards into the fold, the brotherhood turns potential enemies into colleagues, in effect neutralizing future threats.": "兄弟会不断寻求新成员背后的真相是基于一句格言：\"让你的朋友靠近，让你的敌人靠近\"。兄弟会的领导人寻找那些可能通过他们的探索与兄弟会获取和囤积奥秘传说和魔法秘密相竞争的巫师。通过拉拢这些巫师，兄弟会将潜在的敌人变成了同事，实际上是消除了未来的威胁。",
	"Once welcomed into the brotherhood, wizards are free to pursue their own interests so long as they place the security and sanctity of the Hosttower and the cabal above all else. When not rallying to defend their home, wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood act like friendly and unfriendly rivals to one another, striving to outdo their peers in magic. Open conflict between members is forbidden, yet members are adroit at finding underhanded ways to needle and sabotage one another.": "一旦被欢迎加入兄弟会，巫师们就可以自由地追求自己的利益，只要他们把主塔和阴谋集团的安全和神圣性放在第一位。在不团结起来保卫家园的时候，奥术兄弟会的巫师们就像彼此之间的友好和不友好的对手一样，努力在魔法方面超过他们的同行。成员之间的公开冲突是被禁止的，但成员们却善于找到暗中的方法来针锋相对，互相破坏。",

Cora misses her son terribly and she hopes he is still alive.

	"Before they can follow their quarry up Kelvin's Cairn, the characters must locate Garret's base camp at the foot of the mountain. Jarthra Farzassh can lead them there, since she recommended the location to Garret before his expedition left Caer-Konig. Garret's sled dog can also lead characters straight to the base camp. Without help of any sort, the characters can spend 8 hours searching for the camp on their own, finding it with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) group check. If the group check fails, they can repeat it after another 8 hours of looking.": "在他们能够追踪凯尔文之巅上的猎物之前，角色们必须找到加勒特在山脚下的营地。贾瑟拉·法扎斯 (Jarthra Farzassh) 可以带领他们到那里，因为在加勒特的探险队离开凯尔-科尼格 (Caer-Konig) 之前，她向加勒特推荐了这个地点。加勒特的雪橇犬也可以直接带领角色们找到营地。如果没有任何帮助，角色们可以花费 8 小时自行搜索营地，通过一次成功的 DC 15 智力 ({@skill Survival}) 团队检定来找到它。如果团队检定失败，他们可以在另外 8 小时的搜索后重复检定。",
	"If Boy is with the party, the dog can lead the characters to Garret (see \"{@area Fallen Climber|22e|x}\").": "如果小男孩与队伍在一起，狗可以带领角色们找到加勒特（见“{@area Fallen Climber|22e|x}”）。",
	"The party finds itself in the path of an avalanche (see \"{@hazard Avalanche|IDRotF|Avalanches}\"). The avalanche is 200 feet wide, 100 feet long, and 30 feet deep.": "冒险者队伍发现自己处于雪崩的路径中（见\"{@hazard Avalanche|IDRotF|Avalanches}\"）。这场雪崩宽200英尺，长100英尺，深30英尺。",
	"The figure in the snow is Garret Velryn (neutral good human {@creature scout}), a rugged, bearded man in his prime. He has one level of {@condition exhaustion} and 6 hit points remaining. In addition to his weapons, he carries a climber's kit. His other equipment is lost. If the characters have Boy with them, the dog and Garret become inseparable.": "雪地中的人物是加瑞特·维尔林（中立善良人类{@creature scout}），一个英俊而多须的壮年男子。他有一级的{@condition exhaustion}并且剩余6点生命值。除了他的武器，他还携带着一个登山工具包。他的其他装备已经丢失。如果角色们有男孩（Boy）与他们同行，那只狗和加瑞特会变得形影不离。",
	"As the characters tend to Garret, two {@creature Crag Cat|SKT|crag cats} (see {@adventure appendix C|IDRotF|21}) move to within 20 feet of the party and attack, each one pouncing on a randomly determined party member. Known to Ten-Towners as \"Hunters of Men,\" the crag cats caught Garret's scent but failed to reach him before the characters showed up. Characters with passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) scores of 17 or higher are not {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised} by the crag cats. If one crag cat dies, the other one disengages from melee combat and tries to flee down the mountain on its next turn.": "当角色们靠近加勒特时，两只{@creature Crag Cat|SKT|crag cats}（见{@adventure appendix C|IDRotF|21}）靠近队伍20英尺处并发动攻击，每只猛扑向一个随机确定的队伍成员。在十镇人眼中被称为\"人类猎手\"的悬崖猫嗅到了加勒特的气味，但在角色出现之前未能抓到他。感知被动智慧分数（{@skill Perception}）为17或更高的角色不会被悬崖猫袭击。如果一只悬崖猫死亡，另一只会在下一回合退出近战并试图逃向山下。",
	"The cave is home to a mated pair of {@creature Yeti||yetis} and their child, a {@creature yeti tyke|IDRotF} (see {@adventure appendix C|IDRotF|21}). Mother and child are both inside; the father is out hunting but returns shortly with a fresh kill. The cave's interior is shown on map 1.17.": "洞穴是{@creature Yeti||yetis}的一对配偶和他们的孩子，一个{@creature yeti tyke|IDRotF} (见{@adventure appendix C|IDRotF|21}) 的家。母亲和孩子都在里面；父亲正在外面狩猎，不久就带着新猎物回来。洞穴内部显示在地图 1.17 上。",
	"The floor of this 10-foot-high tunnel is strewn with the bones of Mokingo Growling Bear, whose dead body was dragged here. Bits of flesh still cling to the bones. The head has been ripped from its shoulders, gnawed, and stuffed in a niche dug out of the wall. Amid the goliath's bones are torn bits of hide armor, a greataxe, and the skulls and bones of three mountain goats. Seven other crude niches in the walls hold the frozen heads of humanoids previously decapitated by the yetis. One belongs to a dwarf named Oobok (see \"{@area Foaming Mugs|0a1|x}\"). Another belongs to a dwarf named Barthoom, who was killed farther up the mountain a month ago (see \"{@area Ruined Camp|239|x}\").": "这条10英尺高的隧道地面上散落着莫金戈·咆哮熊(Mokingo Growling Bear)的骨骼，它的尸体被拖到这里。骨骼上还残留着一些肉块。头颅已被撕裂，咬碎，并塞进墙壁上挖出的一个壁龛中。在巨人的骨骼中，有撕碎的兽皮盔甲、一把巨斧，以及三只山羊的头骨和骨骼。墙壁上还有七个粗糙的壁龛，里面放着以前被雪怪斩首的人形生物的冻结头颅。其中一个属于一个名叫乌博克(Oobok)的矮人(见“{@area Foaming Mugs|0a1|x}”)。另一个属于一个名叫巴苏姆(Barthoom)的矮人，他在一个月前在山上更高处被杀害(见“{@area Ruined Camp|239|x}”)。",
	"This cave contains a strange sight: a female adult {@creature yeti} watching her child, a {@creature yeti tyke|IDRotF} (see {@adventure appendix C|IDRotF|21}), as it plays with a lightfoot halfling dressed in cold weather clothing and curled up in the fetal position. The halfling is Perilou Fishfinger (neutral good lightfoot halfling {@creature acolyte} of Yondalla). The yeti tyke is knocking her around like a ball, and it's clear from her cries that Perilou is still alive. She has three levels of {@condition exhaustion} but is otherwise unharmed.": "这个洞穴里有一个奇怪的景象：一个成年女性{@creature yeti}正在看着她的孩子，一个{@creature yeti tyke|IDRotF}(见{@adventure appendix C|IDRotF|21})，与一个穿着寒冷天气服装、蜷缩成胎儿姿势的轻足半身人玩耍。这个半身人是Perilou Fishfinger (中立善良的轻足半身人{@creature acolyte}，归属于Yondalla)。雪人幼崽像球一样把她踢来踢去，从她的哭声可以看出Perilou 仍然活着。她有三级的{@condition exhaustion}，但其他方面没有受伤。",
	"As the characters leave the yeti cave, the male adult {@creature yeti} returns home with a dead mountain goat tucked under one arm. Under normal circumstances, the male yeti is hostile, but a character with the Littlest Yeti secret (see {@adventure appendix B|IDRotF|20}) can improve the yeti's attitude. If no one has this secret but the characters have the yeti tyke with them, they can trade the tyke for safe passage up or down the mountain.": "当角色离开雪人洞穴时，成年雄性{@creature yeti}带着一只死山羊夹在一只胳膊下回家。在正常情况下，雄性雪人是敌对的，但拥有“小雪人秘密”（见{@adventure appendix B|IDRotF|20}）的角色可以改善雪人的态度。如果没有人知道这个秘密，但角色们带着雪人幼崽，他们可以用幼崽交换安全通过山上或山下的通行权。",
	"The trip back to Targos can be as fraught or as uneventful as you wish. If the characters take the more direct but dangerous route across the open tundra, they have at least one random encounter in the wilderness (see \"{@area Wilderness Encounters|28e|x}\").": "返回塔戈斯的旅程可以是惊险的，也可以是平静的。如果角色选择更直接但危险的路线穿越开阔的冻原，他们至少会在荒野中遇到一次随机事件（见\"{@area Wilderness Encounters|28e|x}\"）。",
	"Oarus Masthew (lawful good half-orc {@creature scout}) was declared speaker after a close and contentious election. The child of half-orc adventurers, he was adopted by Shaelen Masthew, the previous speaker, who retired from her leadership role but still lives in Termalaine. Oarus is bright, with a sharp sense of humor, but he has political enemies in town and lacks the full support of the town militia.": "在一场激烈而争议的选举后，奥拉斯·马修（(lawful good half-orc {@creature scout})）被宣布为发言人。作为半兽人冒险家的孩子，他被前发言人夏伦·马修收养，后者已经从领导职务上退下来，但仍然居住在特马莱恩。奥拉斯聪明睿智，幽默风趣，但在镇上有政治敌人，也缺乏全体镇民的支持。",
