	"Welcome to {@i Tales from the Yawning Portal}. Within this book you will find seven of the deadliest dungeons from the history of D&D, updated for the current edition of the game. Some are classics that have hosted an untold number of adventurers, while others are newer creations boldly staking their place in the pantheon of notable D&D adventures.": "欢迎来到{@i Tales from the Yawning Portal}。在这本书中，你会发现D&D历史上最致命的七个地牢，并为当前版本的游戏进行了更新。有些是承载了无数冒险者的经典之作，而其他的则是较新的创作，大胆地在著名的D&D冒险圣殿中占据了一席之地。",
	"Just as these dungeons have made an impression on D&D players, so too have tales of their dangers spread across the D&D multiverse. When the night grows long in Waterdeep, City of Splendors, and the fireplace in the taproom of the Yawning Portal dims to a deep crimson, adventurers from across the Sword Coast-and even some visiting from other D&D worlds-spin tales and rumors of lost treasures.": "正如这些地牢给D&D玩家留下的印象一样，关于其危险的故事也在D&D多元宇宙中传播。当辉煌之城沃特迪普的夜色渐浓，打哈欠之门酒馆的壁炉暗淡成深红色时，来自整个剑海岸的冒险者--甚至是一些来自其他D&D世界的来访者，都在传颂着关于丢失宝藏的故事和传闻。",
	"A wanderer from the distant Shou Empire speaks of strange, leering devil faces carved in dungeon walls that can devour an explorer in an instant, leaving behind not a single trace of the poor soul's passing.": "一个来自遥远的寿氏帝国的流浪者说，在地牢的墙壁上雕刻着奇怪的、淫荡的魔鬼面孔，可以在瞬间吞噬一个探险者，不留下一个可怜的灵魂经过的痕迹。",
	"A bald, stern wizard clad in blue robes and speaking with a strange accent tells of a wizard who claimed three powerful weapons from a city on the shores of a lake of unknown depths, who spirited them away to a slumbering volcano and dared adventurers to enter his lair and recover them.": "一个身穿蓝色长袍、说话带着奇怪口音的秃头严厉的巫师讲述了一个巫师从一个不知名的深湖岸边的城市领走了三件强大的武器，他把这些武器带到了一座沉睡的火山，并让冒险家们敢于进入他的巢穴并找回这些武器。",
	"A one-eyed dwarf spins tales of a castle that fell into the earth, and whose ruins stand above a subterranean grove dominated by a tree that spawns evil.": "一个独眼矮人讲述了一个坠入地底的城堡的故事，其废墟矗立在一个地下小树林之上，该小树林由一棵孕育邪恶的树主导。",
	"These are only a few of the tales that have spread across the Sword Coast from the furthest reaches of Faerûn and beyond. The minor details change with the telling. The dread tomb of Acererak shifts its location from a dismal swamp, to a searing desert, to some other forbidding clime in each telling. The key elements remain the same in each version of the tales, lending a thread of truth to the tale.": "这些只是从法鲁恩最远的地方和其他地方传遍剑海岸的几个故事。这些小细节随着故事的进行而改变。可怕的阿塞拉克之墓在每次讲述中都会将其位置从阴暗的沼泽地转移到炙热的沙漠，再转移到其他一些禁忌的气候。在每个版本的故事中，关键因素保持不变，为故事提供了一条真实的线索。",
	"The seeds of those stories now rest in your hand. D&D's deadliest dungeons are now part of your arsenal of adventures. Enjoy, and remember to keep a few spare character sheets handy.": "这些故事的种子现在就在你手中。D&D最致命的地牢现在是你的冒险武器库的一部分。尽情享受吧，并记得保留一些备用的角色表。",

	"These adventures provide the perfect side quest away from your current campaign. If you run published D&D campaigns, such as {@i Storm King's Thunder}, the higher level adventures presented here are an ideal way to extend the campaign beyond.": "这些冒险提供了远离你当前战役的完美副线任务。如果你运行已出版的D&D活动，如{@i Storm King's Thunder}，这里介绍的更高级别的冒险是扩展活动的理想方式。",
	"{@i The Sunless Citadel,} written by Bruce R. Cordell, was the first published adventure for the third edition of the D&D game. It is designed for a party of four or five 1st level player characters.": "{@i The Sunless Citadel,}由Bruce R. Cordell编写，是D&D游戏第三版的第一个出版的冒险。它是为四个或五个一级玩家角色的聚会设计的。",
	"Ever since its publication in 2000, The Sunless Citadel has been widely regarded as an excellent way to introduce new players to the game. It's also a great starting experience for someone looking to be a Dungeon Master for the first time.": "自2000年出版以来，《无日城堡》一直被广泛认为是向新玩家介绍游戏的绝佳方式。对于那些希望首次成为地下城主的人来说，这也是一个很好的开始经验。",

	"{@i The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan,} written by Harold Johnson and Jeff R. Leason, made its debut under the title {@i Lost Tamoachan} at the Origins game convention in 1979, where it was used in the official D&D competition. The first published version of the adventure was produced in 1980.": "{@i The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan,}由Harold Johnson和Jeff R. Leason编写，在1979年的起源游戏大会上以{@i Lost Tamoachan}的标题首次亮相，并被用于官方的D&D竞赛。该冒险的第一个出版版本是在1980年制作的。",

	"Lawrence Schick, the author of {@i White Plume Mountain}, related in the 2013 compilation Dungeons of Dread that he wrote the adventure as a way of persuading Gary Gygax to hire him as a game designer. Not only did he get the job, but {@i White Plume} became an instant favorite when it was first published in 1979.": "{@i White Plume Mountain}的作者Lawrence Schick在2013年的汇编《Dungeons of Dread》中提到，他写这个冒险是为了说服Gary Gygax雇佣他做游戏设计师。他不仅得到了这份工作，而且(1%)在1979年首次出版时就立即成为了人们的最爱。",
	"The version of the adventure in this book is tailored to a group of characters of 8th level.": "本书中的冒险版本是为一组8级的角色量身定做的。",

	"The three linked adventures that make up {@i Against the Giants} were created and originally released in 1978, during the time when Gary Gygax was still writing the {@i Player's Handbook} for the original AD&D game. Despite being (in a sense) older than the game itself, these adventures continue to hold a special place in the hearts and memories of D&D players of all ages.": "构成{@i Against the Giants}的三个链接的冒险故事是在1978年创作并最初发布的，当时Gary Gygax还在为最初的AD&D游戏编写{@i Player's Handbook}。尽管（从某种意义上说）比游戏本身还要古老，但这些冒险在所有年龄段的D&D玩家心中仍然占有特殊的地位和记忆。",
	"The compilation of {@i Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl}, and {@i Hall of the Fire Giant King} was published in 1981 as {@i Against the Giants}. The version presented here is designed to be undertaken by characters of 11th level.": "{@i Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl}和{@i Hall of the Fire Giant King}的汇编在1981年作为{@i Against the Giants}出版。这里介绍的版本是为11级的人物所设计的。",
	"The first version of the adventure was crafted for Gary Gygax's personal campaign in the early 1970s and went on to be featured as the official Dungeons & Dragons event at the original Origins gaming convention in 1975. The first publication of {@i Tomb of Horrors}, as a part of the Advanced D&D game, came in 1978.": "该冒险的第一个版本是在1970年代早期为Gary Gygax的个人活动精心设计的，并在1975年最初的起源游戏大会上作为官方龙与地下城活动的特色。作为高级D&D游戏的一部分，{@i Tomb of Horrors}的首次出版是在1978年。",
	"As a proving ground for characters and players alike, fabricated by the devious mind of the game's cocreator, Tomb of Horrors has no equal in the annals of D&D's greatest adventures. Only high-level characters stand a chance of coming back alive, but every player who braves the Tomb will have the experience of a lifetime.": "作为一个由游戏创造者的邪恶思想所创造的角色和玩家的试验场，恐怖之墓在D&D最伟大的冒险史上是无与伦比的。只有高级别的角色才有机会活着回来，但每一个勇闯古墓的玩家都会有一生难忘的经历。",
	"Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.": "出现在这样的方框中的文字是为了让玩家在他们的角色第一次到达某个地点或在某个特定情况下大声朗读或转述，如文中所述。",
	"The {@i Monster Manual} contains stat blocks for most of the monsters and NPCs found in this book. When a monster's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block in the Monster Manual. Descriptions and stat blocks for new monsters appear in the adventure itself.": "{@i Monster Manual}包含本书中大多数怪物和NPC的状态块。当一个怪物的名字以{@b bold}的字体出现时，那是一个视觉提示，指向怪物手册中该生物的状态块。新怪物的描述和状态块出现在冒险本身中。",
	"While these adventures were never meant to be combined into a full campaign-over 30 years separates the newest from the oldest-they have been selected to provide play across a broad range of levels. With a little work, you can run a complete campaign using only this book.": "虽然这些冒险从来都不是为了组合成一个完整的战役--最新的和最老的相隔30多年--但它们被选来提供广泛的等级游戏。只要稍加努力，你就可以只用这本书开展一个完整的活动。",
	"Starting with The Sunless Citadel, guide your players through the adventures in the order that they are presented in this book. Each one provides enough XP that, upon completing the adventure, the characters should be high enough level to advance to the next one.": "从《无日城堡》开始，引导你的玩家按照本书中的顺序完成冒险。每一个冒险都提供了足够的XP，在完成冒险后，角色应该有足够高的等级来进入下一个冒险。",
	"The Yawning Portal, or some other tavern of your own invention or drawn from another D&D setting, provides the perfect framing device for the campaign. The characters hear rumors of each dungeon, with just enough information available to lead them to the next adventure. Perhaps a friendly NPC drawn from the upcoming adventure visits the tavern in search of help, or some element of a character's background pushes the group down the proper road. In any case, these dungeons are designed to be easily portable to any campaign setting.": "Yawning Portal，或其他你自己发明的或来自其他D&D设定的酒馆，为活动提供了完美的框架装置。角色们听到了每个地牢的传闻，有足够的信息来引导他们进行下一次冒险。也许一个从即将到来的冒险中抽出的友好的NPC会到酒馆寻求帮助，或者一个角色的背景的某些元素会把他们推到正确的道路上。在任何情况下，这些地牢的设计都可以很容易地移植到任何活动环境中。",
	"Amid the bustle of Waterdeep, within the Castle Ward where barristers, nobles, and emissaries battle with word and contract, stands an inn not quite like any other. Before there was a Castle Ward or even what could be recognized as an ancestor of the City of Splendors, there was a dungeon, and in that dungeon begins the tale of the Yawning Portal.": "在沃特迪普的喧嚣中，在大律师、贵族和使者们用言语和契约战斗的城堡区，矗立着一家与其他地方不太一样的旅馆。在没有城堡区或者甚至可以被认为是辉煌之城的祖先之前，有一个地牢，而在那个地牢里，打哈欠的门的故事开始了。",
	"In ages past, the mighty wizard Halaster built his tower at the foot of Mount Waterdeep and delved deep into tunnels first built by dwarves and drow in search of ever greater magical power. Halaster and his apprentices expanded the tunnels they found, worming out new lairs under the surface for reasons of their own. In time, their excavations grew into the vast labyrinth known today as Undermountain, the largest dungeon in all of the Forgotten Realms. Halaster eventually disappeared, as have all his apprentices, but the massive complex he built remains to this day.": "在过去的岁月里，强大的巫师哈拉斯特在沃特德普山脚下建造了他的塔，并深入到最初由矮人和乌鸦建造的隧道中，寻找更强大的魔法力量。哈拉斯特和他的学徒们扩大了他们所发现的隧道，出于他们自己的原因在地表下挖出了新的巢穴。随着时间的推移，他们的挖掘工作逐渐发展成为今天被称为 \"地下山 \"的巨大迷宫，这是整个被遗忘之域中最大的地牢。哈拉斯特最终消失了，他的所有学徒也都消失了，但他建造的巨大建筑群至今仍在。",
	"For untold years, the secrets of Undermountain remained hidden from the surface world. Everyone who entered its halls failed to return. Its reputation as a death trap grew to the point that criminals in Waterdeep who were sentenced to die were forcibly escorted into the dungeon and left to fend for themselves.": "无数年来，地下山的秘密一直被隐藏在地面世界。所有进入其大厅的人都没有回来。它作为死亡陷阱的名声越来越大，以至于在沃特迪普被判处死刑的罪犯被强行押入地牢，任其自生自灭。",
	"All of that changed with the arrival of two men, a warrior named Durnan and a ne'er-do-well named Mirt. The duo were the first adventurers to return from Undermountain, laden with riches and magic treasures. While Mirt used his wealth to buy a mansion, Durnan had different plans. Durnan retired from adventuring and purchased the land on which sat the deep, broad well that was the only known entrance to the dungeon. Around this well he built a tavern and inn that caters to adventurers and those who seek their services, and he called it the Yawning Portal.": "这一切都随着两个人的到来而改变，一个叫杜南的战士和一个叫米特的新教徒。这两个人是第一批从地下山回来的冒险家，满载着财富和魔法宝藏。米特用他的财富买了一座豪宅，而杜南则有不同的计划。杜南从冒险中退休，并购买了土地，那里有一口又深又宽的井，是地牢唯一已知的入口。围绕这口井，他建造了一个酒馆和旅店，以满足冒险者和那些寻求他们服务的人的需求，他把它称为打哈欠的入口。",
	"Some of the magic Durnan looted on his successful foray into Undermountain granted him a life span that exceeds even that of an elf. And for decades Durnan left delving into Undermountain to younger folk. Yet one day, something drew him back. Days of waiting for his triumphant return from the dungeon turned to months and then years. For nearly a century, citizens of Waterdeep thought him dead. But one night, a voice called up from the well. Few at first believed it could be Durnan, but folk as long-lived as he vouched it so. The Yawning Portal had passed into the hands of his ancestors, but Durnan returned with enough riches for them to quietly retire. Durnan took his customary place behind the bar, raised a toast to his own safe return, and then began serving customers as if he'd never left.": "杜南在成功进入地下山时掠夺的一些魔法使他的寿命甚至超过了精灵的寿命。几十年来，杜南把深入地下山的工作留给了年轻的人们。然而有一天，有东西吸引他回来了。等待他从地牢中凯旋的日子变成了几个月，然后是几年。近一个世纪以来，沃特德普的公民都认为他已经死了。但有一天晚上，一个声音从井里叫了起来。起初很少有人相信这可能是杜南，但和他一样长寿的人都证明了这一点。曙光之门已经落入他的祖先手中，但杜南带着足够的财富回来，让他们悄悄退休。杜南在酒吧后面找到了他习惯的位置，为自己的安全返回举杯，然后开始为顾客服务，就像他从未离开一样。",
	"Adventurers from across Faerûn, and even from elsewhere in the great span of the multiverse, visit the Yawning Portal to exchange knowledge about Undermountain and other dungeons. Most visitors are content to swap stories by the hearth, but sometimes a group driven by greed, ambition, or desperation pays the toll for entry and descends the well. Most don't survive to make the return trip, but enough come back with riches and tales of adventure to tempt other groups into trying their luck.": "来自法鲁恩各地的冒险者，甚至是来自多元宇宙其他地方的冒险者，都会来拜访打哈欠的入口，交流关于地下山和其他地牢的知识。大多数来访者都满足于在壁炉旁交换故事，但有时一群人在贪婪、野心或绝望的驱使下，会支付进入的费用并下井。大多数人都没能活到回程，但有足够的人带着财富和冒险故事回来，引诱其他团体尝试他们的运气。",
	"The Yawning Portal is not the only renowned tavern in D&D lore. In the Free City of Greyhawk stands the Green Dragon Inn, which has been the starting point for some of the most successful expeditions to Castle Greyhawk and beyond. The place is crowded and smoke-filled. Patrons talk in low voices, and anyone attempting to strike up a conversation without making a clear intent to pay can expect a cold reception. Paranoia and suspicion run rampant here, as befits a free city that stands at the nexus between a devil-haunted empire, a vast domain locked in the irontight grip of a demigod of evil, and a splintered, bickering host of kingdoms nominally committed to justice and weal. In the battered, weary world of Greyhawk, profit and power take precedence over heroics.": "Yawning Portal并不是D&D传说中唯一著名的酒馆。在灰鹰的自由城，矗立着绿龙客栈，它是一些最成功的远征灰鹰堡和其他地方的起点。这个地方很拥挤，烟雾缭绕。顾客们用低沉的声音交谈，任何试图在没有明确的付款意向的情况下进行交谈的人都会受到冷遇。妄想症和怀疑在这里肆虐，这与一个自由的城市相称，它站在一个被魔鬼困扰的帝国、一个被邪恶的半神牢牢控制的广阔领域，以及一个分裂的、争吵的名义上致力于正义和福利的王国之间的交界处。在灰鹰这个疲惫不堪的世界里，利益和权力高于英雄主义。",
	"The Yawning Portal's taproom fills the first floor of the building. The 40-foot-diameter well that provides access to Undermountain dominates the space. The \"well\" is all that remains of Halaster's tower, and now, devoid of the stairways and floors that formed subterranean levels, it drops as an open shaft for 140 feet. Stirges, spiders, and worse have been known to invade the Yawning Portal from below.": "Yawning Portal的自来水室占满了建筑的第一层。直径40英尺的井提供了通往地下山的通道，占据了整个空间。这口 \"井 \"是哈拉斯特塔的全部遗迹，现在，没有了形成地下楼层的楼梯和地板，它就像一个开放的竖井一样下降了140英尺。据了解，搅屎棍、蜘蛛和更坏的东西都会从下面入侵打哈欠的门户。",
	"Balconies on the tavern's second and third floors overlook the well, with those floors accessed by way of wooden stairs that rise up from the taproom. Guests sitting at the tables on the balconies have an excellent view of the well and the action below.": "酒馆二楼和三楼的阳台可以俯瞰水井，通过从酒水间升起的木质楼梯进入这两层。坐在阳台上的桌子旁的客人可以看到水井和下面的活动，视野极佳。",
	"Those who wish to enter Undermountain for adventure (or the daring tourists who just want to \"ride the rope\") must pay a gold piece to be lowered down. The return trip also costs a piece of gold, sent up in a bucket in advance. Once the initial payment is made, a few stairs takes one to the top of the waisthigh lip of the well. The rope that hangs in the center of the well is levered over to the lip by a beam in the rafters, and when those who have paid are ready, they mount the rope and take the long ride down.": "那些想进入山下探险的人（或只是想 \"骑绳 \"的大胆游客）必须支付一块金子才能被放下去。回程也要付一块金子，事先用桶装好送上去。一旦支付了最初的费用，走几步楼梯就可以到达井口的腰部。悬挂在井中央的绳索被椽子上的横梁撬到了井口，当那些已经付款的人准备好了，他们就登上绳索，长途跋涉下去。",
	"A staggering variety of curios and oddities adorn the taproom. Traditionally, adventurers who recover a strange relic from Undermountain present it to Durnan as a trophy of their success. Other adventurers leave such curios to mark their visits to the tavern, or relinquish them after losing a bet with Durnan, who likes to wager on the fate of adventuring bands that enter the dungeon. Occasionally, something that strikes Durnan's fancy can be used to pay a bar tab.": "种类繁多的奇珍异宝装饰着这个酒馆。传统上，冒险者如果从地下山找回了一件奇怪的遗物，就会把它送给杜南，作为他们成功的战利品。其他冒险者会留下这样的古玩来纪念他们对酒馆的访问，或者在与杜南打赌失败后放弃它们，杜南喜欢对进入地牢的冒险队伍的命运下注。偶尔，杜南看中的东西可以用来支付酒吧的帐单。",

	"On quiet nights, guests in the Yawning Portal gather around a large fireplace in the taproom and swap tales of distant places, strange monsters, and valuable treasures. On busier nights, the place is loud and crowded. The balconies overflow with merchants and nobles, while the tables on the ground floor are filled with adventurers and their associates. Invariably, the combination of a few drinks and the crowd's encouragement induces some folk to pay for a brief trip down into Undermountain. Most folk pay in advance for a ride down and immediately back up, though a few ambitious souls might launch impromptu expeditions into the dungeon. Few such ill-prepared parties ever return.": "在安静的夜晚，\"打哈欠门户 \"的客人们聚集在自来水间的大壁炉旁，交换关于遥远地方、奇怪的怪物和宝贵的宝藏的故事。在比较繁忙的夜晚，这里就会变得喧闹而拥挤。阳台上挤满了商人和贵族，而一楼的桌子上则坐满了冒险家和他们的伙伴。几杯酒加上众人的鼓励，总能诱使一些人花钱到山下做一次短暂的旅行。大多数人都是先付钱，然后马上回来，不过也有几个雄心勃勃的人可能会临时进入地牢探险。这种准备不足的队伍很少有机会回来。",
	"Groups seeking to enter Undermountain for a specific reason generally come to the tavern during its quiet hours. Even at such times, there are still a few prying eyes in the taproom, lurkers who carry news of the comings and goings from Undermountain to the Zhentarim, dark cults, criminal gangs, and other interested parties.": "因特殊原因想进入暗山的团体一般都是在酒馆安静的时候来的。即使在这种时候，酒馆里仍然有一些窥探的目光，这些潜伏者将地下山的来往消息传递给镇塔林、黑暗教派、犯罪团伙和其他感兴趣的人。",

	"Durnan is a man of few words.

Despite his stony heart, he is an excellent source of information about Undermountain and other dungeons, provided one can pay his price.": "杜南是一个寡言的人。他希望自己的时间能得到回报，只有在得到硬性现金的情况下才会提供见解和传言。他说：\"我们知道机会，并抓住我们的机会。\"不管他是在打断一场变成暴力的牌局，还是拒绝被困在井底的冒险者的请求，因为他们无力支付上来的费用。尽管他的心很冷漠，但他是关于地下山和其他地牢的绝佳信息来源，只要人们能支付他的价格。",

	"When the slab finishes moving, it locks into place, so the floor remains steeply sloped and the passage north remains blocked. The locking mechanism is hidden by the northern (elevated) edge of the floor, and it's in a very narrow space. The stone around it can be chipped away over several hours of tedious labor until the edge of the slab no longer holds in place. A {@spell knock} spell can also defeat the locking mechanism.": "当板块完成移动时，它就会被锁住，所以地板仍然是陡峭的斜坡，北方的通道仍然被封锁。锁定机制被地板的北面（高架）边缘所隐藏，而且是在一个非常狭窄的空间。它周围的石头可以通过几个小时的繁琐劳动被削掉，直到石板的边缘不再保持原状。一个{@spell knock}的法术也可以使锁住的机制失效。",

	"The runes are in a script similar to Elvish and spell out the name Ilnedraw. Deft fingers will be able to open the small panel, revealing a hollow inside which is a wall of lighted, colored beads.": "这些符文是类似于精灵语的文字，拼出了Ilnedraw这个名字。灵巧的手指能够打开小面板，露出里面的空洞，里面有一堵亮着的彩色珠子。",
	"Touching any of the beads will cause the panel to close. A few seconds thereafter, the figurine will rise into the air and start to fly about the alcove, hovering at times and avoiding being touched by characters or missiles. Once an exit is available, the figure will fly from the party and move randomly through the ruins, stopping at doors and pausing for a minute. This floating statuette serves no purpose and is more or less a false lead.": "触摸任何一个珠子都会导致面板关闭。几秒钟后，小雕像会升到空中，并开始在凹室中飞行，有时会盘旋，避免被人物或导弹触及。一旦有了出口，这个雕像就会从聚会中飞出，在废墟中随机移动，在门前停下，停顿一分钟。这个漂浮的雕像没有任何作用，或多或少是个假线索。",

	"If the characters approach the statue, the {@creature panther} will stand and pad menacingly in their direction... and then continue on past them. The panther has a mental block that prevents it from being able to see humans, which initially applies to other humanoids as well. It likewise ignores familiars, but it attacks any beast companion or other non-humanoid present with the party.": "如果角色接近雕像，{@creature panther}会站起来，气势汹汹地朝他们的方向踱步......然后继续走过他们。豹子有一个心理障碍，使它无法看到人类，最初也适用于其他人形动物。它也同样无视家族成员，但它会攻击任何野兽伙伴或其他与队伍一起出现的非人类。",
	"If the panther is not attacked and is unable to find a target, it takes to pacing in front of the door. If the party attacks the cat, its mental block regarding other humanoids fails, and the panther attacks any such creature it can see. If it can see no target, the bewildered panther resumes its pacing.": "如果黑豹没有受到攻击，也无法找到目标，它就会在门前踱步。如果对方攻击这只猫，它对其他人类的精神封锁就会失效，黑豹就会攻击它能看到的任何此类生物。如果它看不到目标，迷惑的黑豹就会继续踱步。",
	"The illumination inside the well comes from liquid light, a fluid that clings like oil if touched to a given surface and in the presence of other light eventually spreads to cover the entire surface.": "井内的照明来自于液态光，这种液体如果接触到特定的表面，就会像油一样附着在上面，在有其他光线的情况下，最终会扩散到整个表面。",
	"If a creature falls into the well and is pulled out, the liquid light clings to a small portion of its body, then spreads to cover an additional 5 percent of the body every round. Eventually the liquid covers its eyes, nose and mouth. If this happens, the character can't breathe until the liquid is removed by immersion in water. In the absence of a light source, the liquid light doesn't spread, and a {@spell darkness} spell renders it inert for 1 hour.": "如果一个生物掉进井里并被拉出来，液态光就会附着在它身体的一小部分上，然后每轮扩散，覆盖身体的另外5%。最终，液体覆盖了它的眼睛、鼻子和嘴巴。如果发生这种情况，这个角色就无法呼吸，直到液体被浸入水中而被清除。在没有光源的情况下，液态光不会扩散，一个{@spell darkness}的法术会使其在1小时内失去活力。",
	"If anything is tossed into the well, brilliant light flashes upward and a bellowing voice fills the chamber. The voice belongs to Xipe, and he asks (in Giant) who has come and for what purpose. Nothing else happens, for Xipe can't be bothered to leave his lair to investigate.": "如果有什么东西被扔进井里，灿烂的光芒就会向上闪现，一个吼叫的声音充满了整个房间。这个声音属于Xipe，他问道（用巨人语）谁来了，有什么目的。其他的事情都没有发生，因为Xipe不愿意离开他的巢穴去调查。",
	"The hole in the ceiling leads to Xipe's lair. If the characters try to climb the walls, they discover the walls are too slick to be ascended in this way.": "天花板上的洞通向Xipe的巢穴。如果人物试图爬墙，他们会发现墙面太滑，无法以这种方式登顶。",
	"A surefire way of getting in is to tie a grappling hook to an arrow and shoot the arrow up through the hole. This method never fails to anchor the hook on something, for Xipe grabs the rope once it is fired through his front door. If a creature then decides to climb the rope up into the lair, Xipe starts to reel in the climber when it has ascended halfway.": "一个万无一失的方法是把抓钩绑在箭上，然后把箭从洞口射上去。这种方法从来都能将钩子固定在什么东西上，因为一旦绳子从他的前门射出，Xipe就会抓住它。如果这时有生物决定爬上绳子进入巢穴，Xipe就会在爬到一半的时候开始卷起绳子。",
	"A creature being hauled up into the tunnel can release the rope and drop into the well, taking no immediate damage (other than being covered in the liquid light), or it can swing its body outward and drop onto the floor, taking falling damage. Otherwise, Xipe pulls the climber into his lair in 1 round.": "被拖进隧道的生物可以松开绳子，掉进井里，不会立即受到伤害（除了被液态光覆盖），或者它可以向外摆动身体，掉到地上，受到坠落伤害。否则，西佩会在1个回合内将攀爬者拉入他的巢穴。",
	"Beyond the hole in the ceiling is a chamber that measures 30 feet in each direction. It is the lair of Xipe, an {@creature oni}. Xipe can't cast {@spell cone of cold}, but he can cast {@spell sleet storm} and {@spell fear} once per day each. When he casts {@spell fear}, he unleashes a great bellow that shakes the room.": "天花板上的洞之外是一个每个方向都有30英尺的密室。这是Xipe的巢穴，一个{@creature oni}。Xipe不能施放（1%），但他每天可以施放（2%）和（3%）各一次。当他施放{@spell fear}时，他会发出巨大的吼声，震动整个房间。",
	"Xipe's treasure includes a wooden cylinder that holds a {@item spell scroll} of {@spell detect magic}. Also in his lair are piles of rich cat furs, eight of the furs worth 5 gp each. Two leather bags beneath the furs hold 1,000 sp each.": "Xipe的宝藏包括一个木制圆筒，里面装着{@item spell scroll}的{@spell detect magic}。在他的巢穴里还有成堆的富贵猫毛皮，其中8张毛皮每张价值5戈比。毛皮下面的两个皮袋各装着1000斯普。",
	"The floor of this room is covered with a layer of fine gray dust and ash, three inches deep. Across the room, opposite where you entered, is another set of double doors. There are two empty alcoves to the north and south. On small ledges in each corner of the room are pieces of what appear to be broken pottery.": "这个房间的地板上覆盖着一层灰色的细小灰尘和灰烬，有三英寸深。在房间的对面，在你进来的地方，是另一组双扇门。北面和南面有两个空的凹室。在房间的每个角落的小壁架上都有一些似乎是破碎的陶器碎片。",
	"As you move into the room, your steps send motes of dust and ash swirling into the air, and these clouds form into shapes.": "当你进入房间时，你的脚步让灰尘和灰烬的微粒在空中旋转，这些云彩形成了形状。",
	"First, from the ash, a dusty phantom assumes the shape of a woman. Her face is forlorn and tear-streaked. She throws up her hands in despair, rushes into one of the alcoves, and disappears.": "首先，从灰烬中，一个尘土飞扬的幻影变成了一个女人的形状。她的脸是悲哀的，泪痕累累。她绝望地举起双手，冲进其中一个小房间，然后消失了。",
	"Immediately afterward, two more dusty phantoms emerge—mighty warriors armed with jagged-edged swords and bearing fierce countenances. They move to block the doorway opposite where you entered.": "紧接着，又有两个尘土飞扬的幻影出现了--手持锯齿状剑的强大战士，面目狰狞。他们移动到你进来的地方，堵住了对面的门道。",
	"If the characters approach the phantom guards, they raise their swords threateningly. But they can cause no harm, for they are just images of the long-dead past. For as long as the characters remain in the room, other phantoms—in the shapes of priests, sages, and mourning young women—briefly form out of the dust and then dissipate. Moving through any of these phantom forms causes them to collapse.": "如果人物接近幻影守卫，他们会威胁性地举起剑。但他们不会造成任何伤害，因为他们只是久已逝去的过去的形象。只要人物还在房间里，其他幻影--祭司、圣人和哀悼的年轻女子的形状--就会从灰尘中短暂形成，然后消散。在这些幻影中的任何一个中移动，都会导致它们崩溃。",
	"(Zeel-OAN-an)": "(Zeel-OAN-an)",
	"In the center of this room is a withered tree that looks like a leafless willow, rooted in a terraced depression. The bottom of this hollow is filled with oily water, a few inches deep. Across the room, beyond the dead tree, is another door. Around the sides of the room, a five-foot-wide ledge encircles the tree. The walls of the room are beaded with condensation.": "在这个房间的中心，有一棵看起来像无叶柳树的枯树，扎根在一个梯形的凹陷处。这个凹陷的底部充满了油腻的水，有几英寸深。在房间的对面，枯树之外，是另一扇门。在房间的两侧，有一个五英尺宽的壁架环绕着这棵树。房间的墙壁上布满了凝结的水珠。",
	"The walls of the passage glow magenta, bathing the corridor with a ghastly hue. After fifteen feet, the floor drops away to a pit that fills the hallway ahead. The pit is twenty-five feet deep. Eight large, spidery bushes with thorny stems, white leaves, and enormous yellow blossoms grow across its bottom.": "通道的墙壁发出洋红色的光芒，给走廊染上了一种可怕的色调。十五英尺后，地板掉落到一个填满前面走廊的坑里。这个坑有二十五英尺深。八个大的、带刺的茎、白色的叶子和巨大的黄色花朵的刺状灌木在底部生长。",
	"Five feet beyond the nearest edge of the pit is a bronze bar, set level with the floor and embedded in the pit walls to either side. Farther out over the pit can be seen other similar bronze rungs, set at five-foot intervals. On the floor by the edge of the pit is a scattering of broken, rotting wooden planks.": "在离坑边最近的五英尺处有一根青铜杆，与地面持平，嵌入坑壁的两侧。在坑的更远处可以看到其他类似的青铜阶梯，每隔五英尺设置一个。在坑边的地板上，散落着一些破碎、腐烂的木板。",
	"The third and sixth bars along the way are corroded. When a character moves onto one of these bars, roll a {@dice d20}. On a roll of 5 or lower, or 2 or lower for a Small character, the bar breaks. If the bar doesn't break and the roll is 10 or lower, some obvious sign of the bar's weakness becomes evident, such as chipping or bending.": "沿途的第三条和第六条都被腐蚀了。当一个角色移动到其中一个栏杆上时，掷一个{@dice d20}。如果掷出5或更低的分数，或者对于一个小人物来说，掷出2或更低的分数，铁栏就会断裂。如果钢筋没有断裂，而且掷出的分数是10或更低，那么钢筋弱点的一些明显迹象就会显现出来，例如崩裂或弯曲。",

	"This enormous chamber is thirty feet tall with mighty buttressing and a vaulted ceiling. Parts of the ceiling and walls have collapsed, and raw earth has spilled down from a gaping hole in the east wall. Crushed beneath a fallen block in the center of the room are humanoid remains. Elsewhere around the floor are the chewed and decayed corpses of baboons. Through a hole in the eastern ceiling, daylight and fresh air filter in. Above, through this gap, can be seen four baboons. They jump around the hole and and scream in agitation, and as they do, dirt begins to slide down the banks and rocks in the walls shift slightly.": "这个巨大的房间有30英尺高，有强大的支撑物和拱形的天花板。天花板和墙壁的一部分已经坍塌，生土从东墙的一个缺口中溢出来。在房间中央的一块倒下的石块下面压着的是人形的遗骸。在地板周围的其他地方，有狒狒的咀嚼和腐烂的尸体。通过东边天花板上的一个洞，日光和新鲜空气被过滤进来。在上面，通过这个缺口，可以看到四只狒狒。它们在洞口周围跳来跳去，并激动地尖叫，随着它们的跳动，泥土开始从岸边滑落，墙壁上的岩石也微微移动。",

The back wall is covered by a bas-relief of a giant bat-thing, nine feet tall, with a wingspan of twenty feet. In front of this wall is an altar stone, carved to represent a mass of squirming rats, weasels, and worms. On the front of the altar is the head of a screaming bat. Jutting above the altar on either side are a pair of sharp-edged, metal bat-wings, eight feet long. The floor in front of the altar is worn smooth.": "这显然是一个大型的某种寺庙。曾经是一个主要的建筑，现在只剩下后墙和足够的屋顶来遮挡祭坛。其他地方似乎都被倒下的瓦砾封闭了。有几根柱子倒下了，它们散落在地板上。阳光透过屋顶上的小孔，从三十五英尺高的屋顶上照射下来，屋顶上有很多裂痕和裂缝，形成了一个迷宫。后墙被一个巨型蝙蝠的浮雕所覆盖，它有九英尺高，翼展二十英尺。在这面墙的前面是一块祭坛的石头，雕刻着大量蠕动的老鼠、黄鼠狼和蠕虫。祭坛的正面是一只尖叫的蝙蝠的头。祭坛上方两侧突出的是一对边缘锋利的金属蝙蝠翅膀，长8英尺。祭坛前面的地板被磨得很光滑。",
	"Climbing elsewhere on the debris causes a minor collapse, dealing 2 ({@dice 1d4}) bludgeoning damage to each climber. Each climber must also succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be buried by the debris, taking 7 ({@dice 3d4}) more bludgeoning damage. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the debris engulfs the digger completely, and the trapped character can't breathe until dug out. Struggling out on one's own requires a successful DC 15 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check, and doing so takes 1 minute. Any of these sorts of collapses open no access to the inside.": "在废墟上攀爬会导致轻微的坍塌，对每个攀爬者造成2({@dice 1d4}的重击伤害。每个攀爬者还必须在DC13的灵巧救赎中成功，否则就会被残骸掩埋，再受到7({@dice 3d4})的重击伤害。如果救赎失败5次或更多，碎石会完全吞噬挖掘者，被困的角色无法呼吸，直到被挖出来。自己挣扎出来需要成功地进行DC15力量({@skill Athletics})检查，这样做需要1分钟。任何这类坍塌都无法打开通往内部的通道。",
	"Each time a creature ends its turn on the portion of the roof that remains standing, there is a 20 percent chance that the roof beneath its feet gives way. The creature falls 35 feet, to the rubble below, taking 14 ({@dice 4d6}) bludgeoning damage.": "每当一个生物在屋顶上结束它的回合时，有20%的机会使它脚下的屋顶塌陷。该生物会跌落35英尺，到下面的瓦砾中，受到14{@dice 4d6}的重击伤害。",
	"If the characters begin their investigations of the hidden shrine by arriving at the temple, they need to find a way in. One route is by way of a trapdoor in the floor about 10 feet in front of the altar. A character can discover the seam of the door with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. Any creature that walks across the top of the door has a 1-in-12 chance of triggering it, for the mechanism is old, and long disuse has made it unreliable. Any skilled character's reasonable attempt to keep the door from opening works. Forcing the door to stay open requires a successful DC 10 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. The trapdoor opens onto a slide that emerges above the pit in {@adventure area 53|TftYP-THSoT|1|53. The Valve}. Anyone who slides down the tunnel to the hidden hatch at the other end is dumped into that room.": "如果人物从到达神庙开始调查隐藏的神殿，他们需要找到一条进入的途径。有一条路线是通过祭坛前面10英尺处的地板上的一个活板门。角色可以通过成功的DC 15智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查来发现门缝。任何走过门顶的生物都有1/12的机会触发它，因为这个装置很古老，长期的废弃使它不可靠。任何有技能的角色合理地试图阻止门的开启都是有效的。迫使门保持打开需要成功地进行DC10力量（{@skill Athletics}）检查。活板门开在一个滑道上，滑道在{@adventure area 53|TftYP-THSoT|1|53. The Valve}的坑上方出现。任何顺着通道滑到另一端的隐藏舱门的人都会被扔进那个房间。",
	"Close inspection of the altar reveals handholds along the front side and hinges at the back, indicating that the altar can be lifted from the front and tipped on its side. This can be accomplished by the combined effort of up to three characters with a total Strength of 30 or higher. If the altar is lifted quickly by characters in a standing position, the metal wings whip through an arc from the sides of the altar to the front center about 4 feet off the floor. Each wing's leading edge is razor-sharp. Anyone in the path of a wing must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 ({@dice 3d8}) slashing damage. If a wing misses its first target, it sweeps past that creature with the possibility of striking another creature along the same path.": "仔细观察祭坛，可以发现它的正面有扶手，背面有铰链，这说明祭坛可以从正面抬起来，然后侧向翻转。这可以通过最多三个总力量在30以上的人物的共同努力来完成。如果祭坛被处于站立状态的角色迅速抬起，金属翅膀会从祭坛的两侧向前方中心鞭打出一个弧线，离地约4英尺。每个翅膀的前缘都是锋利的。任何在翅膀路径上的人都必须在DC15的灵巧救赎中成功，否则会受到13({@dice 3d8})的砍伤。如果翅膀错过了它的第一个目标，它就会掠过那个生物，并有可能沿着同一路径攻击另一个生物。",
	"If the altar is tilted by characters while they are in a kneeling position, the wings whistle harmlessly overhead. The other way to avoid the trap is by being careful in the lifting.": "如果祭坛在人物处于跪姿时被倾斜，翅膀就会在头顶上发出无害的哨声。另一个避免陷阱的方法是在抬起时要小心。",
	"The mechanism for the trap is inside the altar. Characters who lift the altar slowly and look underneath it can easily spot the levers and joints that connect with the bladed wings. The characters can prop the altar up, enabling someone to crawl under and disable the trap. Doing that requires 10 minutes of work and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.": "陷阱的机制在祭坛内。角色们慢慢地抬起祭坛，看看它的下面，就可以很容易地发现连接刃翼的杠杆和关节。角色们可以把祭坛托起来，让人爬到下面去解除陷阱。做到这一点需要10分钟的工作，并且需要使用盗贼的工具成功地进行DC15灵巧检查。",
	"Beneath the altar is an 8-foot-deep pit in which are many items of value and two bodies cut in half. The treasure is very bulky. Resting on and buried in a pile of 20,000 silver pieces are the following items: fifty silver chased goblets (worth 5 gp each), twenty gold-plated statuettes (10 gp apiece), forty embossed silver chalices and servings (5 gp each), eighty pieces of jewelry (5 gp apiece), fifty mother-of-pearl pieces (1 gp each), a jade placard bearing the image of Zotzilaha (100 gp), and a marble statue of a reclining figure (50 gp).": "祭坛下面是一个8英尺深的坑，里面有许多有价值的物品和两具被切成两半的尸体。这些财宝非常笨重。躺在和埋在一堆20,000银币里的是以下物品。50个银制的高脚杯（每个价值5戈比），20个镀金的雕像（每个10戈比），40个压花的银制圣杯和餐具（每个5戈比），80件珠宝（每个5戈比），50件珍珠母（每个1戈比），一个印有Zotzilaha形象的玉牌（100戈比），以及一个大理石的卧像（50戈比）。",
	"It is very likely that if large portions of this treasure are taken, Zotzilaha finds out about it and sends a {@creature vampire} or a {@creature giant bat} to seek retribution.": "如果这个宝藏的大部分被拿走，很可能被Zotzilaha发现，并派出一个{@creature vampire}或一个{@creature giant bat}来寻求报复。",
