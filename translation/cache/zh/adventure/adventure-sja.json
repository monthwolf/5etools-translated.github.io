Pots clang and clatter as he turns and waves goodbye to the {@i Flighty Foundling}, which has already set a course back to the academy.": "{@i Flighty Foundling}码头停靠在暴君船旁，它看起来像一个巨大的、石雕的眼魔，漂浮在托瑞尔上空。你被毫不客气地扔进了暴君船的货舱，还有一箱补给、一张导航地图和一个闪亮的{@i spelljammer helm}。瑞贝克下士背着一个装满烹饪用具的背包，走在最后。当他转身挥手告别时，锅碗瓢盆发出叮当声，{@i Flighty Foundling}已经设定了返回学院的航线。",
	"Unless otherwise noted, the ceilings in the chambers within this vessel are 20 feet high. Since the entire ship was constructed using disintegration rays, the surfaces of the floors, walls, and ceilings are smooth and featureless. Climbing a vertical surfaces is difficult without climbing gear or magic, requiring a successful DC 25 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check.": "除非另有说明，否则该飞船内的房间天花板高度为20英尺。由于整艘船都是使用溶解射线建造的，因此地板、墙壁和天花板的表面都是光滑且没有特征。在没有攀爬工具或魔法的情况下，攀爬垂直表面是困难的，需要成功通过DC 25 力量检定（{@skill Athletics}）。",
	"Petty Officer Ryeback (RIE-bak) is a muscular {@creature giff|MPMM} in charge of the food served at the Academy (and on the rare occasion, he crews a ship). Like anyone else who runs a respectable galley, he's a staunch believer in the four basic food groups: beans, bacon, whiskey, and lard. He's raucous and brash and gives bear hugs so good you think he might break a rib (but in a good way). His gray skin is usually coated with light sheen of sweat; kitchens are hot!": "莱巴克（RIE-bak）下士是一个肌肉发达的{@creature giff|MPMM}，负责学院（和在罕见的情况下，他会担任船员）供应的食物。像任何一个管理体面厨房的人一样，他坚定地相信四大基本食物类别：豆类、培根、威士忌和猪油。他粗鲁而喧闹，给人的熊抱好得让你觉得他可能会折断一根肋骨（但是是一种好的方式）。他灰色的皮肤通常被轻微的汗水覆盖；厨房很热！",

	"As soon as the ship starts to spin, Petty Officer Winston Ryeback activates magic tattoo on his arm that allows him to cast the {@spell feather fall} spell once. The tattoo then vanishes.

They can each be fed a {@item potion of healing} from the equipment brought on board.": "当船开始旋转时，下士温斯顿·赖巴克激活了他手臂上的魔法纹身，使他能够施放{@spell feather fall}法术一次。然后纹身消失了。如果麦肯、克里克利特和普弗雷德仍然和他在一起，法术也会影响到他们。如果他们不在他身边，假设当旋转结束时，他们都处于{@condition unconscious}状态，但稳定在0点生命值。他们可以各自从船上携带的装备中获得一个{@item potion of healing}。",
	"Once the characters have disabled or survived the spin cycle trap, they can place the {@i spelljamming helm} in any of the Command Deck's chambers. A spellcasting character can then attune to the helm. If no character can attune to the helm, Miken Haverstance volunteers to serve as the ship's spelljammer. Otherwise, Miken keeps quiet and sticks with Petty Officer Ryeback.": "一旦角色们成功解除或幸存于旋转陷阱，他们可以将{@i spelljamming helm}放置在指挥甲板的任何一个房间里。一个施法角色随后可以调谐到船首。如果没有角色可以调谐到船首，Miken Haverstance自愿担任飞船的法术驾驶员。否则，Miken保持沉默，继续跟随Ryeback下士。",

	"Miken denies knowing who or what started the fire, but he's the only NPC cadet who has any magical talent, making him the most likely suspect. A {@spell detect thoughts} spell or similar magic can reveal his guilt. A character can try to force a confession from Miken, doing so with a successful DC 13 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) check. If the truth comes out, Miken explains that he was recruited by a mercane to set a trap for Petty Officer Ryeback. The mercane gave Miken two {@item Spell Scroll||spell scrolls} to set the trap. Miken expected Petty Office Ryeback would be hurt, but not killed.
