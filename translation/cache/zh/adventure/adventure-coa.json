	"This story takes place in the Nine Hells and sees the characters confront its ruler, {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}. They venture into the Nine Hells to save the souls of their loved ones (or their own) and are aided by a powerful faction. This faction has its own reasons for wanting revenge on {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}. With the help of the characters, the faction believes it can deal a devastating blow to him. In return for a favor, the faction provides characters with access to the Nine Hells and a means of traversing the different layers. The characters travel by barge down the River Styx, also known as the River of Blood, a cross-planar river that links the layers of the Nine Hells. Those who touch or drink from its waters risk forgetting their past lives permanently.": "这个故事发生在九层地狱，看到角色们面对它的统治者，{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}。他们冒险进入九层地狱，拯救他们所爱之人的灵魂（或者他们自己的灵魂），并得到一个强大派系的帮助。这个派系有自己对{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}想要复仇的理由。在角色的帮助下，这个派系相信他们可以对{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}造成毁灭性打击。作为回报，这个派系提供角色们进入九层地狱和穿越不同层次的手段。角色们乘坐驶向血河（也被称为血河的斯提克斯河）的驳船旅行，这是一条连接九层地狱各层的跨位面河流。那些接触或饮用它的水的人会面临永久遗忘过去生活的风险。",
	"The characters try to avoid {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s attention, believing themselves unwanted infiltrators who are there to undermine the Lord of the Nine Hells. Little do they know, they're here by his design. They're integral to one of {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s plots, and he aims to recruit them. But to get them under his control, he needs to corrupt them. It took years of careful planning, and now, finally, he has the characters exactly where he wants them. They will be tested, with temptations and traps set which only the pure of heart can resist. Each time a character gives in to sin, a link is added to the chains that bind them to the Nine Hells, to {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}. Can they save their loved ones without losing themselves in the process?": "这些角色试图避开{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}的注意，他们认为自己是不受欢迎的渗透者，被认为是要破坏九层地狱之主。他们并不知道，他们是被他设计来到这里的。他们是{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}阴谋的关键，他打算招募他们。但要控制他们，他需要腐化他们。经过多年的精心策划，现在，他终于把角色们置于他想要的位置。他们将接受考验，只有纯洁的心灵才能抵抗诱惑和设下的陷阱。每当一个角色屈服于罪恶，就会增加一根链条将他们与九层地狱，与{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}联系在一起。他们能在不失去自己的情况下拯救自己所爱的人吗？",
	"The Nine Hells is the ultimate plane of evil and the epitome of premeditated cruelty. The devils of the Nine Hells are bound to obey the laws of their superiors, and at the very top of the hierarchy is {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}. The Nine Hells has nine layers. The first eight are ruled by archdevils who answer to {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.": "九层地狱是邪恶的终极位面，是预谋残忍的典范。九层地狱的恶魔们被束缚于遵守他们上级的法律，而在层级体系的最顶端是{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}。九层地狱有九个层次。前八层由大恶魔统治，它们须服从{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}。要到达九层地狱的最深层，必须按顺序穿越以上所有八层。最快捷的方法是斯提克斯河，它从一层流向下一层时不断深入。只有最勇敢的冒险者才能忍受那段旅程中的折磨和恐怖。",

	"The River Styx This river bubbles with foul water, and along its banks are the remains of thousands of battles. There are captains who are skilled enough to command a ship through the unpredictable currents of the river. For a price, these pilots are willing to carry passengers into the lower depths of the Nine Hells. They're the only ones who know how to avoid the dangers of the River Styx, including the warships that patrol it.": "冥河(Styx)这条河水泡泡汹涌，沿岸散落着无数战斗的残骸。有些船长技艺高超，能够指挥船只穿越这条变幻莫测的河流。他们愿意以一定的价格，将乘客带入九层地狱的深处。只有他们知道如何避开冥河的危险，包括那些巡逻的战舰。",
	"These warships are built from infernal iron (bristling with spikes, blades, and chains) and can travel the waters of the River Styx. Weapons used by the infernal warships include flamethrowers, acid spewed from bronze tubes, and launchers that fire a dozen ballista bolts at once.": "这些战舰是由地狱铁（上面布满尖刺、刀片和链条）建造而成，可以航行在冥河的水域。地狱战舰使用的武器包括喷火器、从青铜管中喷出的酸液，以及可以一次发射一打弩箭的发射器。",
	"Sin must be at the core of any story that takes place in the Nine Hells. These Hells are based on Dante's Inferno, the famed 14th-century poem which depicted Hell as nine concentric circles of torment. Each circle of Hell tormented a different class of sinner, from the unbelievers of the 1st circle down to the great betrayers of the 9th circle.": "罪恶必须是发生在九层地狱中的任何故事的核心。这些地狱是基于但丁的《神曲》，这部著名的14世纪诗歌描绘了地狱为九个同心圈的折磨。每个地狱圈折磨着不同类别的罪人，从第一圈的不信者到第九圈的大叛徒。",
	"The poem focused on describing the acknowledgement and rejection of sin. In this story, good people have committed grievous sins that will have consequences. Some of these people might be the player characters.": "这首诗专注于描述对罪恶的承认和拒绝。在这个故事中，善良的人犯下了严重的罪行，将会有后果。其中一些人可能是玩家角色。",
	"Each layer of the Nine Hells embodies a particular sin, as described in the sections that follow. Feel free to add other sins, but be careful when you do. Some classical interpretations of sins shouldn't be used in any adventure. Others, such as lust or gluttony, should be handled very carefully.": "九层地狱的每一层代表着特定的罪恶，如下所述。可以添加其他罪恶，但在这样做时要小心。一些传统的罪恶解释不应该在任何冒险中使用。而其他一些，比如淫欲或暴食，应该非常谨慎处理。",
	"The sin of anger fuels wrath, vengeance, and inner turmoil. It takes root in Avernus, the domain of the archdevil {@creature Zariel|CoA}.": "愤怒之罪助长了愤怒、复仇和内心的混乱。它扎根于阿弗努斯（Avernus），这是大恶魔{@creature Zariel|CoA}的领地。",

	"Some say that this is the original sin which led to all other sins and is the sin that led to the fall of {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} and thus is his domain.": "有人说这是导致所有其他罪恶的原罪，也是导致{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}堕落的罪孽，因此是他的领域。",
	"Betraying a loved one, a god, or a sovereign can damn one's soul to Stygia, the domain of the archdevil {@creature Levistus|CoA}.": "背叛所爱之人、神明或君主可能会导致灵魂被诅咒至斯提吉亚（{@creature Levistus|CoA}）的领域。",

	"Some players may be uncomfortable if a soul is consigned to the Nine Hells for a sin when the person so condemned lived a good life in aggregate. However, all the souls consigned to the Nine Hells in this adventure were deceived by {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}. While they committed sins, that wasn't the reason they were consigned to the Nine Hells. However, {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} ensures that the soul is punished as if the sin was the one that defined it.": "一些玩家可能会感到不舒服，如果一个灵魂因为犯了一个罪过而被送入九层地狱，而这个人在整体上过着善良的生活。然而，在这个冒险中，所有被送入九层地狱的灵魂都被{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}欺骗了。虽然他们犯了罪，但这并不是他们被送入九层地狱的原因。然而，{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}确保灵魂被惩罚，就好像罪过定义了它一样。",
	"To run this adventure, you need the fifth edition rulebooks: {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, {@book Monster Manual|MM}, and {@book Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}. {@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA} would also be a good source; {@adventure Chains of Asmodeus|CoA} can be run as a continuation of that story.": "为了进行这个冒险，你需要第五版规则书：{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}、{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}、{@book Monster Manual|MM}和{@book Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}。{@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA}也是一个很好的参考来源；{@adventure Chains of Asmodeus|CoA}可以作为那个故事的延续。",

If they've any interest in saving those unfortunates, the characters need to locate the citadel for Baphomet.": "巴福梅特(Baphomet)指着大地的另一边，远离冥河(Styx River)，建议他们从那个方向开始搜索。在这一点上，角色们可以自由离开，轻松地绕道返回{@creature Koh Tam|CoA}的驳船，确保逃脱，尽管这会让被囚禁的人类置身于恶魔的摆布之下。如果他们对拯救这些不幸的人有兴趣，角色们需要找到巴福梅特的城堡。",
	"Baphomet assembled his camp at this location, knowing it was near a devil patrol route, so locating a citadel won't be difficult. After {@dice 1d4} hours the characters see a citadel on the horizon. Any activity out of the ordinary attracts the attention of the citadel's crew (a spell or other visually impressive distraction suffices). Once it begins moving towards them it is easy for the characters to keep ahead of the citadel and reach the camp and Baphomet's tent before it arrives. Baphomet is ecstatic at their success, though distracted at the impending battle. He gestures to their reward and then exits his tent. Through the open flap, the characters watch the citadel's arrival.": "巴尔弗梅特(Baphomet)在这个位置建立了他的营地，因为他知道这附近是恶魔巡逻路线，所以找到一座城堡不会很困难。{@dice 1d4}小时后，角色们看到地平线上出现了一座城堡。任何不寻常的活动都会引起城堡船员的注意（一个咒语或其他视觉上引人注目的干扰就足够了）。一旦城堡开始朝他们移动，角色们就很容易领先城堡并在它到达之前到达营地和巴尔弗梅特的帐篷。巴尔弗梅特对他们的成功感到欣喜，尽管他对即将到来的战斗感到分心。他指向他们的奖励，然后走出帐篷。透过敞开的帐篷帘，角色们看着城堡的到来。",
	"The gigantic basalt citadel, shaped like a sword's blade, emerges from the clouds above the River Styx. Screaming demons madly scurry onto the bone platforms laying around the fort. Chasmes add to the cacophony as groups of those fly-like demons grasp the platforms, dragging each into the sky.": "巨大的玄武岩城堡，形状如剑刃般，从冥河上方的云层中显现出来。尖叫的恶魔疯狂地匆匆跑上围绕堡垒的骨头平台。查斯姆(Chasmes)加入了混乱的喧嚣，一群群飞蝇般的恶魔抓住平台，将每个平台拖入天空。",
	"There are several choices the characters can make at this point but attacking the citadel is a doomed endeavor and the party should be encouraged to avoid joining the demons.": "在这一点上，角色们有几种选择，但攻击要塞是注定会失败的努力，应鼓励队伍避免加入恶魔。",
	"As Baphomet departs the characters should try and make an escape with their reward. If they didn't win the captives' freedom earlier, they must now defeat one {@creature goristro} guard to free the captives. The remainder of the demonic host doesn't notice these hostilities, busy as they are with the assault. Once on the barge, the characters witness the assault's failure from a distance.": "当巴尔弗梅特（Baphomet）离开时，角色们应该试图携带他们的奖励逃跑。如果他们之前没有赢得俘虏的自由，他们现在必须打败一个{@creature goristro}卫兵来释放俘虏。其余的恶魔军队并没有注意到这些敌对行动，因为他们正忙于进攻。一旦登上驳船，角色们就可以从远处目睹进攻的失败。",
	"As {@creature Koh Tam|CoA}'s barge drifts down the River Styx, you watch the ill-fated attack on the flying citadel fail as the great swarms of chasmes are torn asunder by various winged devils, their precarious platforms tumbling, each collapse sending dozens of demons and their human allies to their deaths. Silhouetted against the skyline stands Baphomet, the great demon merely shrugging at the failure before walking back towards his camp.": "当 {@creature Koh Tam|CoA} 的驳船漂流在冥河上时，你看着注定失败的对飞行堡垒的攻击，众多恶魔群被各种有翅膀的恶魔撕裂，他们脆弱的平台摇摇欲坠，每次倒塌都会导致数十个恶魔和他们的人类盟友坠入深渊。在天际线的映衬下，巴尔弗摩（Baphomet）站在那里，这位伟大的恶魔对失败只是耸耸肩，然后走回他的营地。",
	"If the characters want to join in the assault on the citadel, it is clear that the demons shall lose this battle.

A swarm of them will push against the mast, sails and even hull of the Styx barge to drive it against the shore. A successful {@dc 15} Strength check is required by the navigator to keep a boat on course. The ayperobos aren't interested in eating the flesh of their victims; instead, they serve a greater threat.

	"Surviving in the Nine Hells is entirely dictated by one's ability to follow mindless legal codes and a self-preservation instinct that has no qualms about backstabbing. New arrivals find that, unless they offer a uniquely powerful skillset, they're the lowest of the low, used only as cannon fodder in the Blood War. Moving through the ranks requires either manipulating the strict laws of the realm, betraying comrades, or commanders—or sometimes both. Devils that find themselves higher in the hierarchy tend to lead relatively comfortable lives, so long as they obey their superiors and maintain a steady stream of souls. For the battle-hungry, the Blood War always longs for more combatants, and proving oneself on the battlefield is a surefire way to a quick promotion. As for the various non-devil inhabitants, existence remains possible so long as it doesn't interfere with devilish schemes. For mortals? Just try not to die.": "在九层地狱中生存完全取决于一个人遵守毫无意义的法规和一种毫不犹豫背叛他人的自我保存本能。新到达的人会发现，除非他们拥有独特强大的技能，否则他们是最低贱的，只被用作血战中的炮灰。要晋升需要操纵领域的严格法律、背叛同志或指挥官，有时两者兼而有之。发现自己在等级制度中更高的恶魔往往过着相对舒适的生活，只要他们服从上级并保持源源不断的灵魂供应。对于渴望战斗的人来说，血战总是渴望更多战士，在战场上证明自己是一个快速晋升的绝佳途径。至于各种非恶魔居民，只要不干扰恶魔的计划，他们的存在就是可能的。对于凡人来说？尽量不要死。",

	"In the Nine Hells, it is safe to assume that someone is always listening. This has left the occupants of the Nine Hells in a constant state of paranoia. Anyone who tries to communicate telepathically here, has the unnerving feeling of an infernal presence listening in.

	"In the mortal world, springs bring water to the surface, trickling lines of liquid coming together, forming streams of ever-increasing size until they feed into great rivers. The River Styx is different, like the Ouroboros, it feeds in on itself. Smaller branches circle around, and, on an adjacent layer of the Nine Hells, feed back into the river.

	"The waters of the River Styx aren't just dangerous to navigate. Unless immune to the river's effects, a creature that drinks from the Styx or enters the river is targeted by a {@spell Feeblemind} spell (save {@dc 20}).

And the blazing and barbed armies of the Nine Hells rose to meet them, as they always do, and it went on. And on. A single engagement of the Blood War that raged back and forth while, on more mundane planes, mortal lifetimes came and went, empires rose and fell, species were created and became extinct. Countless demons and devils fought and were destroyed or banished. Countless. That was the problem.\" {@creature Koh Tam|CoA} pauses, as if not quite sure of where he's taking the story. He glances at you, then continues.": "\"曾经有一场战斗，甚至将九层地狱的极限推至其破裂点。恶魔们仍在低声议论着这场伟大的混战，主要是因为它仍然导致了地狱的官僚主义。在那一天，阿弗瑞斯的天空裂开，恶魔们不断涌入，一波又一波。九层地狱的炽炎和带刺的军队崛起迎战，就像他们总是做的那样，战斗持续着。一场血战的单次交锋来回肆虐，而在更加平凡的位面上，凡人的一生来来去去，帝国兴衰，物种诞生灭绝。无数的恶魔和恶魔战斗，被摧毁或被放逐。无数。这就是问题所在。\" {@creature Koh Tam|CoA} 暂停了一下，仿佛不太确定自己要把故事带向何方。他看了你一眼，然后继续说道。",

The island at the center of the lake is one such nest.": "有一段时间，{@creature Zariel|CoA}的手下仍然怀抱希望，认为还剩下有限数量的恶魔，它们会在无尽的岁月中慢慢减少，直到没有一个恶魔剩下，而沼泽可能会恢复到阿弗纳斯(Avernus)的自然状态。最近的地狱调查发现，这个地方有大量证据表明，恶魔物质的聚集地（类似巢穴）正在以至少与被杀死的生物同样快的速度产生随机的恶魔。通过这些巢穴，战争沼泽(WarSlough)不断延续着自己。湖中心的岛屿就是这样一个巢穴。",
	"Moist ichor covers the floors and walls. There's a pounding noise in the distance, as if a large machine is rumbling away, performing some unfathomable work. The tunnels seem to undulate, in rhythm with the noise, and in places you think you see terrible faces etched into the stone. Many tunnels appear to lead into caves where ichor has accumulated.": "潮湿的血浆覆盖着地板和墙壁。远处传来一阵隆隆声，仿佛一台巨大的机器正在轰鸣，进行着一些难以理解的工作。隧道似乎在随着这个声音起伏，有些地方你觉得在石头上刻着可怕的面孔。许多隧道似乎通向积聚了血浆的洞穴。",
	"Each cave has {@creature hezrou} and {@creature barlgura} embedded in its walls, many only partially formed. Blood vessels in the walls pump demonic ichor into the catatonic demons. Attacking any of them awakens {@dice 1d6} of each.": "每个洞穴的墙壁上嵌有{@creature hezrou}和{@creature barlgura}，许多只是部分形成。墙壁中的血管将恶魔的血浆泵入那些陷入瘫痪状态的恶魔体内。攻击其中任何一个会唤醒{@dice 1d6}中的每一个。",
	"A mixture of two dozen {@creature dretch||dretches} and {@creature manes} mill about mindlessly in these caves. They ignore intruders but descend with fury on anyone who attacks them.": "这些洞穴里有两打{@creature dretch||dretches}和{@creature manes}混合在一起，毫无目的地四处走动。它们会无视入侵者，但对任何攻击它们的人展开猛烈反击。",
	"A great lake of ichor sits before you, undulating to the demonic rhythm that has only grown louder. Along the shoreline you see a small demon clamber out of the ichor, its arm covered in dozens of eyeballs. It pays you no heed and shambles down a tunnel. Across the grotesque expanse is an island upon which sits a heart the size of an elephant. This heart pumps demonic ichor into the blood vessels permeating these caverns.": "你面前是一片巨大的脓血湖，随着愈发响亮的恶魔节奏起伏不定。沿岸，你看到一个小恶魔从脓血中爬了出来，它的手臂上布满了数十只眼球。它毫不理会你，蹒跚走进了一个隧道。在那个怪诞的湖泊对面，有一个岛屿，上面坐着一个像大象心脏那么大的心脏。这颗心脏将恶魔脓血泵入贯穿这些洞穴的血管中。",
	"Coming into contact with the ichor of the lake forces a creature to succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or roll on the Flesh Warping table. Gibbering dretches or manes demons that spawn from the demonic heart swim across the lake. They ignore anyone they see and emerge from the lake with a new deformity (use the Flesh Warping table for examples). These demons tend to accumulate in the various caves. The characters need to cross the lake to reach \"The Heart.\"": "接触湖水的粘液会迫使生物成功通过一次 {@dc 15} 体质豁免检定，否则需要在肉体扭曲表上进行投掷。从恶魔之心产生的咕噜恶魔或鬼怪恶魔在湖中游动。它们忽略任何看到的人，然后带着新的畸形从湖中出现（可参考肉体扭曲表的例子）。这些恶魔往往会聚集在各个洞穴中。人物需要穿过湖泊才能到达“心脏”。",
	"The island is about 60 feet from the shore. Once it is reached, the characters can walk up to the heart itself. The heart has an AC of 8 and 200 hit points. Killing it causes the lake to become inert. However, as soon as it is damaged, the heart will awaken the hezrou and barlgura to come to its aid. On initiative count 10 of each round {@dice 1d4} of each arrive in the chamber and begin swimming across the lake.": "小岛距离岸边约60英尺。一旦到达，角色可以走到心脏本身。心脏的防御等级为8，有200点生命值。杀死它会导致湖泊变得不活跃。然而，一旦受到伤害，心脏将唤醒赫兹鲁(`hezrou`)和巴尔古拉(`barlgura`)前来帮助。在每轮的10号先攻中，{@dice 1d4}每个都会到达房间并开始横渡湖泊。",
	"When the lake becomes inert all the demons act as if they're under the {@spell Confusion} spell. However, instead of acting normally on rolling a 9 or a 10 (as per the spell), this roll results in the demon inflating like a balloon and then exploding, showering demonic ichor in a 10-foot-radius. Anyone in that area must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or be forced to roll on the Flesh Warping table.": "当湖泊变得惰性时，所有恶魔都会表现得好像受到了{@spell Confusion}咒语的影响。然而，与其像咒语规定的那样在掷出9或10时表现正常，这次掷骰的结果是恶魔会像气球一样膨胀然后爆炸，在10英尺半径范围内洒下恶魔的血浆。在那个区域内的任何人必须成功进行{@dc 15}宪法豁免才能免受迫使进行肉体扭曲表格掷骰的影响。",
	"A character who seeks their brother's soul, notices movement in the ground underneath the demonic heart.": "一个寻找自己兄弟灵魂的角色，注意到了恶魔之心下方地面的动静。",
	"There's a glimmer of movement beneath sticky ichor pooling under the pulsating heart. For a moment you see your brother's face protrude from the floor. He glances your way but briefly, a grimace of pain on his face, before succumbing and falling back into the ichor.": "在那颗跳动的心脏下面，粘稠的粘液池中有一丝微弱的动静。你看到你兄弟的脸从地板上凸起。他瞥了你一眼，脸上带着痛苦的苦笑，然后不情愿地倒在粘液中。",
	"Once the heart is slain, the ichor can be pulled aside, and the brother's phylactery recovered. The character gains the Phylactery Benefit associated with it.": "一旦心脏被杀死，精华就可以被拉开，兄弟的魂器就可以被找回。角色获得与之相关的魂器效益。",
	"A vast and twisted battlefield extends before you, cleaved in two by a massive canyon. Whether the canyon existed before that great battle, or arose because of it, you cannot be certain. A trail, paved in corpses, descends into the canyon.": "一片广阔而扭曲的战场展现在你面前，被一条巨大的峡谷分成两半。无论这条峡谷是在那场大战之前存在的，还是因为那场战斗而形成的，你都无法确定。一条由尸体铺成的小径蜿蜒而下进入峡谷。",
	"The characters' attention is drawn by a voice from a nearby pile of corpses. If they investigate, they find a powerful artifact buried within. This is an opportunity to conjure a tempting reward for one of the characters; select a character and an item they've been coveting. That is the item they now find. You may also select an item that multiple characters might want so that they may argue among themselves over who gains possession of it.": "当角色们听到附近一堆尸体中传来声音时，他们的注意力被吸引了。如果他们进行调查，他们会发现其中埋藏着一件强大的神器。这是一个为其中一个角色制造诱人奖励的机会；选择一个角色和一个他们一直渴望的物品。这就是他们现在发现的物品。你也可以选择一件多个角色可能想要的物品，这样他们可以争论谁获得它的所有权。",
	"Once one character has taken the item, run the \"{@adventure Sentient Artifact|CoA|3|Sentient Artifact}\" temptation event found in chapter 2.": "一旦一个角色拿起了物品，就运行在第2章中找到的“{@adventure Sentient Artifact|CoA|3|Sentient Artifact}(%temptation event%)”事件。",
	"This isolated canyon descends into the depths of the Slough and is where the real treasures of the War-Slough are found, including the horn that Rexlexkala desires. Strange things occur sporadically as the characters descend, the place twisted and distorted by the great war. When a character least expects it (perhaps just after a rest, or in the midst of battle), a {@creature grotesque tentacle|CoA} with a shrieking mouth instead of suckers bursts from the canyon wall to flail about wildly before withdrawing again. The tentacles are harmless unless the characters decide to attack one (then the tentacles have the statistics of a {@creature guardian naga}, but 0 movement speed, lawful evil alignment and no spellcasting trait).": "这个偏僻的峡谷深入到Slough的深处，是战斗沼泽的真正宝藏所在，包括Rexlexkala所渴望的角。当角色们下降时，奇怪的事情偶尔发生，这个地方被大战扭曲和扭曲。当角色最不期望的时候（也许就在休息后，或者在战斗中间），一个{@creature grotesque tentacle|CoA}从峡谷墙壁上爆发出来，嘴巴尖叫而不是吸盘，疯狂地挥舞着然后再次撤退。触手是无害的，除非角色决定攻击其中一个（那么触手就具有{@creature guardian naga}的统计数据，但没有移动速度，合法邪恶的阵营，也没有施法特性）。",
	"Though the tentacles can be safely ignored, there are real dangers in the canyon. And to find items of true value, the characters have to make an effort to explore, heading deep into the canyon's bowels. Each hour the characters make a {@dc 20} Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check to search for clues that might lead them to the treasures they seek. Failure results in an encounter, while success leads to treasure.": "尽管触手可以安全地被忽略，峡谷中确实存在真正的危险。为了找到真正有价值的物品，角色们必须努力探索，深入峡谷的深处。每小时角色们都要进行一次 {@dc 20} 智力 ({@skill Survival}) 检定，以寻找可能带领他们找到所寻宝藏的线索。失败会导致一次遭遇，而成功则会带来宝藏。",
	"The first time the characters fail their search results in them encountering the \"Temptation of Anger.\" Afterwards, on future failures, roll a {@dice d8}. 1–4 means an empty cave; 5–6 means they stumble upon {@dice 1d2} {@creature glabrezu}; a 7–8 means they find {@dice 1d4} {@creature hezrou}.": "角色们第一次搜索失败时，他们遭遇到“愤怒的诱惑”。之后，在未来的失败中，掷出一个{@dice d8}。1-4表示一个空洞；5-6表示他们偶然发现{@dice 1d2} {@creature glabrezu}；7-8表示他们找到{@dice 1d4} {@creature hezrou}。",
	"Every time the characters succeed in their search for clues, they have a {@chance 50|50 percent} chance of finding Rexlexkala's Horn. Otherwise, they roll on the Infernal Items table. For a description of these items {@adventure see appendix D|CoA|16}. When they find the item, it might be in the clutches of a tentacle that erupts from the canyon walls, or it might be lodged at the bottom of a bubbling pool of {@creature demon ichor|CoA} (which is a black pudding with 120 hit points and immunity to fire damage). After 3 such items, they'll no longer find any more infernal items here and even successful searches are now treated as failures.": "每次角色们成功寻找线索时，他们有{@chance 50|50 percent}的机会找到雷克斯莱卡拉的号角。否则，他们需要在地狱物品表上投掷骰子。有关这些物品的描述{@adventure see appendix D|CoA|16}。当他们找到物品时，它可能被夹在从峡谷壁上喷发出来的触手中，或者被卡在一个冒着泡泡的{@creature demon ichor|CoA}池底（这是一个拥有120点生命值和对火焰伤害免疫的黑布丁）。在找到3个这样的物品后，他们将不再在这里找到任何地狱物品，即使成功搜索也会被视为失败。",
	"A {@creature nalfeshnee} carries the artifact that Rexlexkala seeks and won't relinquish it without a fight. The artifact looks like a metallic horn, but if touched it begins to wriggle like a grotesque worm. Other than this it can be handled safely. An {@spell Identify} spell reveals that it is meant to be swallowed to attune to it, but if anyone other than a devil does so, they gain none of its powers and instead are afflicted with a random major insanity that can't be removed until the artifact is extracted.": "一名{@creature nalfeshnee}携带着雷克斯莱卡拉（Rexlexkala）寻找的神器，并不会轻易放弃，除非经过激烈的战斗。这件神器看起来像一只金属号角，但如果触摸它，它会开始像一个怪诞的蠕虫一样扭动。除此之外，它可以安全地处理。一种{@spell Identify}法术揭示出它是要被吞食以调谐的，但如果除了恶魔之外的任何人这样做，他们将不会获得任何力量，而是会受到一种无法移除的随机重大精神错乱的影响，直到神器被取出。",

	"The city lies nestled within a fiery ring of mountains, with the only two ways in or out being the Iron Road and the River Styx. It is described by visitors as impossibly large and yet cramped at the same time. Like the Iron Road, its buildings are constructed from a mix of cobblestone and burning iron, both mined from the mountains of the realm. Because the iron is heated, it emits smoke and covers the city in a smog, making it difficult to see and breathe for mortals. Additionally, the city and the Iron Road are bathed in a warm light from the burning steel, with the surrounding mountains remaining dark aside from the lit mines.

Many bazaars and shops are set up offering strange wares from different planes, and {@creature Dispater|CoA} encourages any on the plane to establish contracts whenever possible. These contracts usually involve souls and the greater devils, who make homes in the massive iron towers scattered throughout the town. Beneath the city lies a labyrinthian structure of dungeons, said to contain mortals from the Material Plane. Vents in certain areas of the city allow bloodcurdling screams to float up from below.": "超位面旅行者常常在前往其他地方之前停留在这座城市，因为它以在各个层面内作为贸易和商业中心而闻名。许多集市和商店摆摊，提供来自不同位面的奇特商品，{@creature Dispater|CoA} 鼓励任何在这个位面上的人尽可能建立合同。这些合同通常涉及灵魂和更大的恶魔，他们居住在遍布城镇的巨大铁塔中。城市下方是一个迷宫般的地下城结构，据说里面关押着来自物质位面的凡人。城市某些区域的通风口允许令人毛骨悚然的尖叫声从下方飘出。",
	"Unlike leaving Avernus, traveling deeper into the Nine Hells from Dis is quite difficult. The only two known passages are the Styx and a staircase, both of which descend to Minauros. Though the location of the staircase isn't publicly known, everyone assumes it to be located within {@creature Dispater|CoA}'s Iron Tower, making it difficult to find without connections. The Styx is especially dangerous, as the drop from Dis to Minauros consists of steep inclines, rapids, and waterfalls. It takes a seasoned captain or a large amount of luck to navigate the passage, leaving nascent souls or mortals without means of traveling deeper.": "与离开阿弗努斯不同，从迪斯深入地狱九层相当困难。已知的两个通道只有斯提克斯河和一座楼梯，它们都通往米诺罗斯。尽管楼梯的具体位置并不为人所知，但每个人都假定它位于{@creature Dispater|CoA}的铁塔内，这使得没有关系的人很难找到。斯提克斯河尤其危险，因为从迪斯到米诺罗斯的降落包括陡峭的斜坡、急流和瀑布。要想航行这一通道，需要经验丰富的船长或大量的运气，否则新生灵或凡人将无法继续深入。",
	"Iron itself bends to the influence of Dis. Whenever a good-aligned creature touches nonmagical iron, they take 4 ({@damage 1d8}) fire damage.

However, they can also learn from Orishada, who is a braggart, that {@creature Dispater|CoA} must leave his Wrought-Iron Tower with Orishada before he goes to an audience with {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}. He can't bring his symbol of power when he goes before his master, and he doesn't trust to leave it with someone at his abode; thus, he often leaves it in Orishada's care.": "{@creature Dispater|CoA} 将在几个小时内访问奥里沙达。虽然极为困难，但一群特别聪明的角色也许能通过欺骗（虽然幻术不起作用）或者简单地抢夺并逃跑来窃取{@creature Dispater|CoA}的锻铁塔（这是他的护符）。然而，他们也可以从奥里沙达那里得知，他是一个自吹自擂的人，{@creature Dispater|CoA} 必须在去见{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}之前将他的锻铁塔留在奥里沙达那里。当他去见他的主人时，他不能带着他的权力象征，也不放心把它留给他住处的某人；因此，他经常把它留在奥里沙达的照料下。",
	"If the characters express disbelief that Orishada could safely care for such a powerful item, the devil bristles at the offense. He shows off the special chest he has had constructed to safeguard the artifact. The adamantine chest is built into the floor itself and hence unmovable and protected with a magical lock that requires a code writ in glyphs to be entered successfully, in sequence. Each failure results in a loud boom heard up to a mile away (surely drawing any guards' attention) and a devious trap. Each creature within 30 feet of the chest when the trap is triggered must make a {@dc 19} Dexterity saving throw. A failed save results in 36 ({@damage 8d8}) damage of a type that the creature is vulnerable to (necrotic damage if the creature has no vulnerability). Succeeding on the saving throw results in the damage being halved.": "如果角色们对奥里沙达能够安全保管如此强大的物品表示怀疑，那魔鬼会对这种冒犯感到愤怒。他展示了特制的保护神器的特殊箱子。这个精钢箱嵌入地板中，因此无法移动，并且受到一个需要用符文书写的代码才能成功输入的魔法锁保护。每次失败都会导致一声巨响，可以在一英里之外听到（肯定会引起任何卫兵的注意），并触发一个狡猾的陷阱。当陷阱被触发时，距离箱子30英尺内的每个生物都必须进行一次{@dc 19}敏捷豁免投掷。未通过豁免的生物将受到36({@damage 8d8})点易受伤害类型的伤害（如果生物没有易受伤害类型，则为死灵伤害）。通过豁免则伤害减半。",

	"Entering the realm on a series of artificial channels the Styx's stretch into Minauros is one of the most dangerous sections of the river. Closing the massive distance between the ceiling of the cave and the bog below, the river turns into cascading waterfalls and severe rapids, eventually falling almost 200 feet into a small pool in the swamp. From here, it winds through the bog to a hot corner of the layer and into an extinct volcano. Inside the caldera is a whirlpool, which dumps into Phlegethos below. For the inexperienced, knowing where the swamp ends and the Styx begins is extremely difficult, and more than a few inhabitants end up walking right into the deadly river, drowning as their memories depart.": "穿越一系列人工水道进入幽冥河(Minauros)的延伸是这条河最危险的部分之一。河流将洞穴的天花板与下方的泥沼之间的巨大距离缩短，变成了瀑布和急流，最终跌落近200英尺到沼泽中的一个小水池。从这里，它蜿蜒穿过泥沼，到达该层的一个炎热角落，然后进入了一座死火山。在火山口内部有一个漩涡，将水倾泻到下方的(Phlegethos)。对于缺乏经验的人来说，很难分辨泥沼的尽头和幽冥河的开始，许多居民最终走进这条致命的河流，随着他们的记忆消失而溺亡。",
	"Although the swamp itself could prove dangerous, native inhabitants to the layer feel their realm is perhaps the most magnificent. Indeed, it contains vegetation, animal life, and differing pockets of temperature, all features largely unique to Minauros. The entire layer is lit by a bioluminescent fog excreted from the trees, which some devils even describe as beautiful. However, the weather helps temper expectations. Minauros experiences galeforce winds almost constantly, which carry with them the stench of death. Precipitation of some form is constant, with rain and sleet leaving behind an oily slime that covers everything. The occasional hailstorms are extremely dangerous, with pieces of hail falling like thrown daggers.": "虽然沼泽本身可能很危险，但该层的本地居民却觉得他们的领域可能是最壮丽的。事实上，它包含了植被、动物生命和不同的温度区域，这些特征在米诺洛斯（Minauros）是独一无二的。整个层都被树木排泄出的生物发光雾气照亮，一些恶魔甚至形容它美丽动人。然而，天气却让人难以满足期望。米诺洛斯经常遭受强风，带来的是死亡的腥臭。降水形式是持续的，雨水和雨夹雪留下一层油腻的粘液覆盖一切。偶尔的冰雹风暴极为危险，冰雹坠落如投掷的匕首。",
	"Despite being known as the layer of bogs, Minauros is more than just swamp. Outcroppings of volcanic stone, flooded volcanos, and crystalline obsidian are all scattered throughout the layer. Ancient cities, half-sunk underneath the bog, contain hidden treasures or small communities. Perhaps due to {@creature Mammon|CoA}'s obsession with wealth over duty, Minauros is the plane containing the most wayward and lost souls.": "尽管被称为沼泽之层，但（Minauros）不仅仅是沼泽。火山岩矗立、火山被淹没、晶莹的黑曜石散布在整个层中。古老的城市半沉在沼泽下，隐藏着宝藏或小社区。也许由于{@creature Mammon|CoA}对财富而非责任的痴迷，（Minauros）是包含最多迷失灵魂的位面。",

	"Travel from Minauros to the lower layers is relatively easy, assuming one can appeal to the native creatures. Navigating the Styx only requires an understanding of the swamp, and even new captains can sometimes find their way. If one can gain entry into Jangling Hiter, the kytons maintain a passageway between layers, and aren't stingy about its use. Last and perhaps most dangerous are the mud geysers found in the hotter parts of the bog. They create a wreathing passage directly into Phlegethos, though the path is often blocked by strange creatures, molten mud, tight passages, and heat vents.": "从米诺罗斯(Minauros)到更低的层次旅行相对容易，只要能够与当地生物沟通。穿越斯提克斯(Styx)只需要了解这片沼泽，即使新船长有时也能找到前进的方向。如果能够进入叮当地狱(Jangling Hiter)，凯顿(kytons)会维护层次之间的通道，并且对使用通道并不吝啬。最后，也许最危险的是在沼泽炎热部分发现的泥浆间歇泉。它们直接通往弗莱吉索斯(Phlegethos)，尽管路径经常被奇怪生物、熔岩泥浆、狭窄通道和热气孔阻挡。",
	"Toxicity flows from the swamps of Minauros into the air, and spreads throughout the entire layer.

Around the Trove, however, the usual tribulations of the place are combined with an unsettling babble, in the ears and in the mind.

Now she broods restlessly in her lair deep in the swamps, tormented by the understanding that her 'treasure' is something she can't hold or physically possess.

In return, Klassk keeps Ilfrich safe from the dangers of Minauros, and the two have become strong allies.

Four enormous vultures loom behind her, their beady eyes fixed upon you.": "当你跋涉穿过浑浊的沼泽时，腐烂和腐朽的恶臭弥漫在空气中，你看到一只翅膀的身影栖息在前方一根多节的树桩上。这个生物的皮肤是深黑色的，虽然她大部分被盔甲覆盖着。她的头发是火红色的，与她的眼睛相匹配。她腰间系着一条带有闪亮铂金扣的优雅腰带。四只巨大的秃鹫在她身后隐约可见，它们的圆滚滚的眼睛盯着你。",
	"Thelekarna, an {@creature erinyes}, is another power of the Trove. Once a powerful captain under {@creature Mammon|CoA}'s command, she was given the region around the Trove to patrol in ages past. Exposure to the contamination of mortal qualities seeped into some flaw in her infernal nature, and she fell prey to a peculiar madness. {@creature Mammon|CoA} has often boasted that Minauros is the grandest of Hells because of its thronging life, and Thelekarna doubles down on this dubious philosophy, claiming that she is the protector of the region's horrible, crawling ecology. Infested with mortal ideas, she claims to be an infernal druid and supplements her regular fiendish powers by mustering and commanding the life of the swamps around her. She is always accompanied by four {@creature giant vulture||giant vultures} that look like they're rotting from the inside out.

	"Nobody is quite sure what Grinken Eyre originally was, not even {@creature Mammon|CoA}. It crept into the Trove long ago, and the constant rub of mortal feelings wore it smooth like a stone on a beach. All that is left is a vacant malevolence papered over with a face constructed of all the pieces of mind and life around it—much as the larvae of some insects build shells of plants and stones to disguise themselves. What Grinken Eyre is now is a kind of infernal doppelganger, a thing that can show its visitors any face, feign any positive quality and be absolutely convincing in the moment because there is nothing beneath at all. A guide, a fellow treasure hunter, a questing paladin, a lovable rogue with a charming grin, that kindly old mage or your own best friend, all these things can be Grinken Eyre. And, being a thing of the Nine Hells, any meeting with the creature ends badly sooner or later, a blade in the back, hands at the throat or a treacherous path to a monster's lair. Countless travelers claim to have rid the Nine Hells of Eyre, and yet the thing always seems to haunt the Trove. More recently stories suggest a shift in the monstrous deceiver, though. Those who have encountered it and survived tell of longer and longer grace periods before their new companion revealed its evil nature, as though the stitched-together identities Eyre constructs are becoming more and more real, to the point of suppressing the creature's own evil nature. The Trove is full of all manner of mortal experience, after all.

It mingles with the lava inside the volcano and exits inside its molten rivers. A small layer of obsidian serves as the riverbank, which is also a bank to the lava river flowing alongside the flanks of the Styx. It passes many of the landmarks in the layer, including a dock just outside Abriymoch.

	"If the characters are to have any chance of finding what they're looking for they need to meet Kordichai.

	"Having spent so long outside the Nine Hells, in the company of non-devils, Kordichai is as close to eccentric as a denizen of the inferno can become. Kordichai lives for the hunt. He bitterly envies the mortals who get to live and die and truly risk themselves against the great monsters of their worlds, who are all mere puppies and kittens to a great Fiend like himself. Wealth and power in the Nine Hells mean very little to him compared to the thrill of the chase. And so Kordichai decided that if he couldn't travel to hunt, he'd bring the hunt home to him. Of course, the searing fields of Phlegethos are hostile territories for most of the great monsters the planes can boast, so Kordichai—through the calling in of a great many favors—opened a portal that decanted the entire contents of a swathe of the Plane of Fire out into his territory in the Nine Hells.": "在九层地狱外度过了如此长时间，与非恶魔为伴，科迪凯（Kordichai）已经接近怪僻，就像一个地狱居民可以变得的那样。科迪凯为狩猎而活。他痛苦地羡慕那些可以在他们的世界中生活、死去并真正冒险对抗伟大怪物的凡人，对于像他这样的伟大恶魔来说，这些怪物只不过是小狗和小猫。对他来说，九层地狱中的财富和权力与追逐的刺激相比微不足道。因此，科迪凯决定，如果他不能出去狩猎，他就会把狩猎带回家。当然，菲莱戈索斯（Phlegethos）的灼热领域对于大多数平面可以引以为傲的伟大怪物来说是敌对领土，因此科迪凯——通过许多人情的召唤——打开了一个传送门，将火焰位面一大片区域的全部内容倒出到他在九层地狱的领土中。",
	"Between the shores of the molten sea and the basalt canal walls of the Styx he built his wildlife preserve, stocked with Elemental creatures of all kinds. He raised mountains and sunk chasms, had sweating teams of minor devils dig artificial lakes and channels for the lava to roll into, even had them plant whole flaming forests of elemental trees that burn forever without turning to ash, releasing searing seeds buoyed on the eternal updrafts. In seeking to create a hunting ground, Kordichai also inadvertently created a place of eerie and violent beauty within Phlegethos' burning wastes.": "在熔岩海岸和冥河玄武岩运河墙之间，他建立了他的野生动物保护区，里面养着各种元素生物。他耸立山峦，沉没深渊，让一队队汗流浃背的小恶魔挖掘人工湖泊和渠道，让熔岩滚滚而下，甚至让他们种植整片元素树林，这些树永远燃烧而不化为灰烬，释放出灼热的种子在永恒的上升气流中漂浮。Kordichai试图创建一个狩猎场所，却无意中在Phlegethos的燃烧废墟中创造了一个怪异而暴力美丽的地方。",

	"As well as his floating barges, Kordichai maintains a number of hunting lodges of incandescent iron dotted across the Preserve, staffed by {@creature barbed devil||barbed devils} and {@creature Pain Devil (Excruciarch)|CoA|pain devils} ({@adventure see appendix B|CoA|14}) and stocked with food, drink, and souls for the refreshment of his guests. Here he keeps his trophies, the blazing horns and tusks and wall-mounted heads of his greatest kills—both the fiery beasts of the preserves and those he hunted down on further planes.

	"The Elemental Preserve isn't entirely the unchallenged territory of Fiends. Kordichai perhaps received a little more than he bargained for when he stole away a great stretch of the Plane of Fire. A community of efreet has its home somewhere in the wilds, established in caves and ambushing unwary devils. Trapped for generations, they've since found their way to the portal and been able to cross sporadically back and forth to their home. Their leader, Hateli of the Storm, has sworn vengeance on all of the Nine Hells for the desecration wreaked against the Firelands. She and her people remain in the Preserve by choice, sabotaging the devils where they can. Kordichai is well aware of them but considers their efforts an additional spice to his hunts. While efreet are usually almost as unwelcome as devils to a mortal, Hateli has been known to shelter and aid those cut loose in the Preserve purely to spite the devils. Hateli ({@creature efreeti} with 250 hit points) is accompanied by {@dice 1d4} {@creature efreeti||efreet} and {@dice 2d4} {@creature salamander||salamanders}.": "元素保护区并非完全是邪魔们无可争议的领地。当科迪凯窃取了一大片火焰位面时，或许他得到的比他预期的要多一些。一群伊弗利特在荒野中找到了自己的家园，他们在洞穴中建立了基地，埋伏那些不警惕的恶魔。被困数代，他们终于找到了传送门，并能够偶尔来回穿梭到他们的家园。他们的领袖，风暴之怨哈特莉，发誓要为对火焰之地的亵渎报仇。她和她的人民选择留在保护区，尽力破坏恶魔们的计划。科迪凯对他们了如指掌，但认为他们的努力为他的狩猎增添了额外的乐趣。虽然对于凡人来说，伊弗利特通常几乎和恶魔一样不受欢迎，但哈特莉因恶魔而故意庇护和帮助那些在保护区中迷失的人。哈特莉（{@creature efreeti}拥有250点生命值），她的随从包括{@dice 1d4} {@creature efreeti||efreet}和{@dice 2d4} {@creature salamander||salamanders}。",

	"This is a rare opportunity for the characters to interact with an archdevil directly. Both are willing to talk with the characters, though are amused at the presence of mortals among the other hunters.": "这是角色们与一位大恶魔直接互动的难得机会。两者都愿意与角色们交谈，尽管对于其他猎人中出现凡人感到好笑。",
	"As members of the hunt, the characters may use the ballista on the barge, or leave the safety of the barge to face the prey directly. Each hour roll on the Hunt Random Encounters table to see what the hunters discover.": "作为狩猎团成员，角色可以使用驳船上的弩炮，或者离开驳船的安全，直接面对猎物。每小时在狩猎随机遭遇表上投掷骰子，看猎人们会发现什么。",
	"Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@damage 3d10}) cold damage. A creature with fire resistance or immunity is considered vulnerable to the damage of this bolt.": "远程武器攻击：+6命中，射程120/480英尺，目标为一名敌人。命中：16 ({@damage 3d10}) 冰冷伤害。对于具有火焰抗性或免疫力的生物，这支箭的伤害会被视为具有致命性。",
	"Every hunt needs a team of beaters to rouse the prey so that the hunters can have their fun. A selection of devils, powerful outsiders and even particularly wicked mortal rangers are recruited into Kordichai's service for this purpose. He even barters for the souls of those who were formally his hunting companions, recruiting them into eternal service as his beaters and wardens.": "每次狩猎都需要一支驱赶者团队来惊动猎物，以便猎人们能尽兴地狩猎。一些恶魔、强大的异界生物，甚至特别邪恶的凡人游侠都被招募到科迪凯(Kordichai)的服务中来。他甚至为曾经是他狩猎伙伴的人的灵魂进行交易，将他们招募为他的驱赶者和典狱长，永远为他效劳。",
	"As beaters, the characters join a group that includes a {@creature bone devil}, a pair of {@creature azer||azers}, a {@creature salamander} and a tiefling {@creature scout}. These beaters follow the leadership of whoever the characters appoint as captain. Their job is to drive the prey toward Kordichai's barge. To do this, they need to spread out in a formation that has them 30 feet away from the nearest beater. Every hour, the designated captain must make a {@dc 15} Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check. Success results in a roll on the Hunt Random Encounters table. Each failure angers Kordichai. Three failures in a row and Kordichai calls the hunt off and sends a halfdozen {@creature horned devil||horned devils} to dispose of the beaters. The characters are now treated as 'prey' and should use the appropriate encounters during the remainder of their exploration of the preserve.": "作为打猎者，角色们加入了一个小组，其中包括一个{@creature bone devil}，一对{@creature azer||azers}，一个{@creature salamander} 和一个鬼族{@creature scout}。这些打猎者遵循角色们任命为队长的人的领导。他们的工作是将猎物驱赶到科迪恰伊的驳船附近。为了做到这一点，他们需要以距离最近的打猎者30英尺的间距展开队形。每小时，指定的队长必须进行一次{@dc 15}感知({@skill Survival})检定。成功会导致在猎物随机遭遇表上进行一次投掷。每次失败都会激怒科迪恰伊。连续三次失败，科迪恰伊就会取消狩猎并派遣半打{@creature horned devil||horned devils}前来处理打猎者。角色们现在被视为“猎物”，在探索保护区的其余时间里应该使用适当的遭遇。",
	"As well as hunting powerful creatures, Kordichai has other cruel pastimes on the Preserve. Bands of valiant mortals who brave the Nine Hells are sometimes brought to him for disposal, and he releases them into the searing wilds of the Preserve. Each is given some trinket that wards off the heat and the choking air, but only for a limited period. The wretched mortals are told of the portal to the Plane of Fire that might allow them escape from the Nine Hells (though not whether it is open at this particular point in time) and set loose. Shortly after, Kordichai, his beaters, and guests start their own hunt, in the air or on foot. He particularly appreciates it when his victims turn on each other and fight over the protective trinkets. In cases where there is only one runner left at the end, Kordichai normally grants the fugitive the honor of single combat, a risk that raises infernal eyebrows but at least provides entertainment one way or the other.": "在保护区，除了狩猎强大的生物外，科迪凯还有其他残忍的消遣方式。那些勇敢冒险穿越九层地狱的人类团队有时会被带到他那里处置，然后释放到保护区的灼热荒野中。每个人都会被赠予一些能够抵御炎热和令人窒息的空气的小玩意，但只能维持有限的时间。这些可怜的人类会被告知有一扇通往火焰位面的传送门，或许可以让他们逃离九层地狱（尽管并不清楚这个特定时间点是否开放），然后被释放。不久之后，科迪凯、他的驱赶者和客人们开始他们自己的狩猎，无论是在空中还是步行。他特别欣赏当他的受害者互相攻击，为了争夺那些保护性小玩意而战斗。在最后只剩下一个逃跑者的情况下，科迪凯通常会授予逃犯进行单挑的荣誉，这种冒险会引起地狱般的惊讶，但至少提供了某种形式的娱乐。",
	"If Kordichai designates the characters as prey, then they're told of a location in the Preserve where they can meet the other prey. If the characters are looking for the prey on their own, they can use divination magic or tracking—a successful {@dc 20} Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check—to locate them. The prey consists of a human {@creature veteran}, elf {@creature mage}, dwarf {@creature gladiator} and tiefling {@creature priest}. They look to the characters for leadership. They know some of the locations and denizens of the Preserve, including the hunting lodges, the {@creature efreeti} and the {@creature Eriflamme|CoA}. Each hour, the prey must make a {@dc 20} Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check to avoid the dangers of the Preserve. Failure means a roll on the Hunt Random Encounters table. A failure of 10 or less means that Kordichai's barge has found them. They can also try to find a specific location or denizen such as a hunting lodge. This requires a successful {@dc 15} Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check, but also means that they can't avoid the dangers and so must roll on the Hunt Random Encounters table, even if they succeed.": "如果科迪凯(Kordichai)将角色指定为猎物，那么他们会被告知一个在保护区内可以与其他猎物会面的地点。如果角色自行寻找猎物，他们可以使用占卜魔法或追踪——一个成功的{@dc 20} 智力 ({@skill Survival}) 检定——来定位它们。这些猎物包括一个人类 {@creature veteran}，一个精灵 {@creature mage}，一个矮人 {@creature gladiator} 和一个鬼灵 {@creature priest}。他们寻求角色的领导。他们了解保护区的一些地点和居民，包括狩猎小屋，{@creature efreeti} 和 {@creature Eriflamme|CoA}。每小时，猎物必须进行一个 {@dc 20} 智力 ({@skill Survival}) 检定，以避免保护区的危险。失败意味着在狩猎随机遭遇表上进行一次投掷。10或更低的失败意味着科迪凯的驳船找到了他们。他们也可以尝试寻找特定的地点或居民，比如一个狩猎小屋。这需要一个成功的 {@dc 15} 智力 ({@skill Survival}) 检定，但也意味着他们无法避免危险，因此必须在狩猎随机遭遇表上投掷骰子，即使他们成功了也是如此。",
	"Each of the hunted is given an amulet. Once worn, it grants them immunity to fire damage for three hours. After which point the amulet smolders then disintegrates. The other prey only have two hours remaining before they begin taking fire damage.

	"Dragons and phoenixes may not be the most dangerous denizens of the Preserve. There remains one beast hidden across the many miles of wilderness that Kordichai has hunted but never caught. A thing of guile and power and stealth hiding in the brightness and ambushing the unwary, it is neither an Elemental nor a Fiend but allegedly a creature formed of the two different planes meeting. The {@creature Eriflamme|CoA} (see the accompanying stat block), as it has become known, is said to resemble a perpetually blazing tarrasque formed of interlocking Elementals all tessellated together. It is malleable, capable of breaking apart into a host of individual bodies and forming again at will. Track it as he might, Kordichai has never brought the monster to bay. Only the twisted wreckage of barges, the ruin of lodges, and the bodies of his servants testify to its existence and its power. Over time, Kordichai has grown more and more obsessed with this one elusive denizen of his Preserve, taking greater and greater risks, even shirking his duties at the slightest suggestion it has made an appearance.": "龙和凤凰可能不是保护区中最危险的居民。在科迪奇（Kordichai）曾经猎杀但从未捕获的广袤荒野中，仍然隐藏着一种野兽。这是一种狡诈、强大且隐秘的生物，隐藏在明亮之中，埋伏着不谨慎的人。它既不是元素生物，也不是恶魔，据说是由两个不同位面相遇形成的生物。这个被称为{@creature Eriflamme|CoA}（请参阅附带的属性块）的生物据说类似于一个永远燃烧的恐龙，由相互锁定的元素生物组成，全部拼贴在一起。它是可塑的，能够分裂成一群个体，并随意重新组合。无论科迪奇如何追踪，他都从未将这个怪物逼入绝境。只有沉船的扭曲残骸、小屋的废墟和他仆人的尸体证明了它的存在和力量。随着时间的推移，科迪奇对他保护区中这个难以捉摸的居民变得越来越着迷，冒着越来越大的风险，甚至在它一露面的最微小暗示下都放弃了自己的职责。",
	"Even as Abriymoch is the preferred destination for devils from all over the Nine Hells seeking off-duty entertainment, so a place on Kordichai's hunts is the prize for any infernal notable. Needless to say, his superiors {@creature Fierna|CoA} and {@creature Belial|CoA} are constantly foisting less than suitable guests on him, sometimes because they wish to genuinely reward an underling or curry favor with magnates from other layers of the Nine Hells, alternatively because they wish to make a fool of some pompous upstart they know is ill-equipped to keep up with Kordichai's hectic pace. Devils have been killed on his hunts, sometimes in hunting accidents and occasionally—should {@creature Fierna|CoA} give Kordichai the word—in 'hunting accidents'. Everyone knows it happens, and that only adds to the thrill of the chase. If the characters have persuaded Kordichai to set up an ambush on {@creature Fierna|CoA} or {@creature Belial|CoA}, then this is when he makes his move.": "即使阿布里莫克（Abriymoch）是来自九层地狱各地寻求休闲娱乐的恶魔们首选的目的地，但在科迪凯（Kordichai）的狩猎中获得一个位置对于任何地狱的显要人物来说都是一个奖励。不用说，他的上级{@creature Fierna|CoA}和{@creature Belial|CoA}经常把不太合适的客人推给他，有时是因为他们真的想奖励下属或讨好来自九层地狱其他层的大人物，另一方面是因为他们想让一些自以为是的新人出丑，他们知道这些人根本无法跟上科迪凯忙碌的步伐。在他的狩猎中，有恶魔被杀死，有时是因为狩猎意外，偶尔——如果{@creature Fierna|CoA}给科迪凯下令——是“狩猎意外”。每个人都知道这种情况会发生，这只会增加追逐的刺激。如果角色已经说服科迪凯在{@creature Fierna|CoA}或{@creature Belial|CoA}设下伏击，那么这就是他行动的时刻。",

Going up requires navigating the lightning storm, which is powerful and chaotic enough that few make it out alive. Likewise, the pit leading to Malbolge is plagued by falling rocks and sudden shifts in wind pattern, making the descent more luck than skill.": "包括直接连接到冥河的次元门，穿越斯提吉亚的各个层次是简单而简洁的。进入和离开这个领域是通过冥河进行的。拥有飞行能力的生物可以飞向冥河进入的菲列格索，或者飞向马尔波尔格，但这两条路线都极其危险。向上飞行需要穿越雷电风暴，这场风暴强大而混乱，以至于很少有人能活着走出来。同样，通往马尔波尔格的坑洞充斥着掉落的岩石和风向突变，使得下降更多靠运气而非技巧。",
	"The cold of Stygia chills to the bone, leaving creatures fighting for survival.

	"Constructed along a bank of the Styx, Tantlin overlooks a unique branch in the river. Many portals connecting to other planes of existence are tied to the distributaries, and travelers from all over arrive and depart on the Styx. This makes Tantlin a unique trading city in the Nine Hells, with its focus on commerce completely disconnected from the soul trade. While they welcome travelers of all kinds, mortals find the temperature extremely dangerous, and demons are slain on sight by an elite hunting party-turned-police force.": "坐落在冥河岸边，坦特林（Tantlin）俯瞰着河流中的一条独特支流。许多通往其他存在平面的传送门都与这些支流相连，来自世界各地的旅行者都会抵达并离开冥河。这使得坦特林成为了九层地狱中一个独特的贸易城市，其商业重心完全脱离了灵魂交易。虽然他们欢迎各种旅行者，但凡人发现这里的气温极其危险，而恶魔则会被一支精英狩猎队伍转变而来的警察部队当场击毙。",
	"A {@creature pit fiend}, perhaps in the service of {@creature Levistus|CoA}, approaches a character.": "一个{@creature pit fiend}，或许是为了{@creature Levistus|CoA}效劳，走向一个角色。",

The sahuagin roam the waters of Sheyruushk. In those places where the ice is thin enough, they can be glimpsed, riding massive sharks, and gliding through the water underneath. However, travelers would be wise to resist the urge to go and see this sight. If the ice is thin enough to allow a glimpse of the sahuagin, it is also thin enough for these fierce aquatic warriors to breach it for an attack. If the characters don't want to be dragged underneath the ice, they best not visit here.": "在坦特林市附近，两座冰山之间的裂缝通往谢伊鲁什克(`Sheyruushk`)。在这里可以找到鲨鱼般的塞胡亚金(`sahuagin`)，这些海上恶魔已经在冰下的水域中建立了家园。塞胡亚金在谢伊鲁什克的水域中游荡。在冰层足够薄的地方，它们可以被瞥见，骑着巨大的鲨鱼，在水下滑行。然而，游客最好抵制前往观看这一景象的冲动。如果冰层足够薄以便瞥见塞胡亚金，那么这些凶猛的水下战士也足够强大，可以突破冰层发动攻击。如果角色不想被拖入冰下，最好不要来这里参观。",

	"If the characters spend an hour or more exploring this area before returning to a safer location, they find a devilish arm extruding from the ice. It takes half an hour to excavate the corpse and when they do so they observe that the dead creature is holding a ring in its hand, its frozen eyes staring at it in rapture. The characters must break the corpse's hand to take the Ring of Collecting ({@adventure see appendix D|CoA|16}).": "如果角色在返回到一个更安全的地点之前在这个区域探索了一个小时或更长时间，他们会发现一只恶魔般的手从冰块中伸出。挖掘尸体需要半个小时，当他们这样做时，他们观察到死去的生物手中拿着一枚戒指，它的冰冻眼睛盯着它陶醉地看着。角色必须打破尸体的手来取得《收集之戒》（{@adventure see appendix D|CoA|16}）。",
	"Those traveling across the frozen wastes of Stygia, looking for a place to rest may be unlucky enough to wander into the Chasm of Found Things. They may believe themselves fortunate, thinking they've found shelter from the icy cold. But they're mistaken. No one finds the Chasm, it finds you.

	"\"Still, you must venture out there, into the cold. Allow yourself to get lost.\" {@creature Koh Tam|CoA} gestures at the frozen wastes. \"Sometimes those lost within the blizzards of Stygia find signs: mortal tracks through the snow, set down recently.

	"The mouth of the cave is a curious piece of theatre. Mortal hands have certainly touched the place. The ice is carved into dwellings—huts and chambers laboriously scoured from its freezing substance. Elsewhere, materials have been hauled in to build huts and lean-tos. There are the ashes of old fires. Mortals have dwelled here, and recently.": "洞穴的入口是一出奇特的戏剧。肯定有凡人的手触摸过这个地方。冰被雕刻成住所——小屋和房间从冰冷的物质中费力地刮出。在其他地方，材料被搬来建造小屋和棚屋。这里有旧火的灰烬。凡人曾在这里居住，而且是最近的。",
	"It is enough to give a living traveler hope and drive devils to a rage. In either case, the idea is to draw the traveler inwards and downwards. From the depths of the cave can be heard faint sounds: the echo of voices, confused and distorted. The caves are occupied; the dwellers at the threshold have retreated deeper into the ice to escape Stygia's harsh climate. And the caves truly are warmer, a little. Enough that meltwater is constantly flowing into them, carving runnels on the floor and trickling inwards so that all the caves resound to the music of it, further confusing the suggestion of life and voices from below. The keen-eyed visitor might feel that signs of habitation at the cave-mouth seem oddly shallow and staged but by then it may be too late. Every visitor drawn to the cave mouth feels a powerful fascination with the depths, a need to know what is down there, the certainty that what they seek can be found below. Those equipped with divinatory magic may discover that the ubiquitous infernal taint of the Nine Hells really is weaker here, and perhaps mistake that for virtue. In truth there is only ever a choice of evils.": "给予一个活着的旅行者希望足矣激怒恶魔。无论哪种情况，都是为了将旅行者引向内部和向下。从洞穴深处传来微弱的声音：回声，声音混乱扭曲。洞穴已被占据；门口的居民已经退到更深的冰层中，以避开斯提吉亚严酷的气候。而这些洞穴确实更温暖一些。足够让融水不断流入其中，在地板上刻出沟壑，向内淌去，使得整个洞穴都回荡着这种音乐，进一步混淆了来自下方的生命和声音的暗示。眼尖的访客可能会觉得洞口处的居住迹象似乎奇怪地浅薄且布置好像舞台，但那时也许已经为时已晚。每一个被吸引到洞口的访客都会对深处产生强烈的迷恋，渴望知道下面是什么，确信他们所寻找的东西可以在下方找到。那些具备占卜魔法的人可能会发现九层地狱普遍的邪恶气息在这里确实较弱，或许会误以为这是一种美德。事实上，这里只有恶的选择。",
	"Progressing downwards from the abandoned structures at the cave mouth the visitor finds a maze of twisting ice tunnels, slippery with the constant run of meltwater, and from this point they're observed. The heedless or weary visitor will just stumble deeper and deeper, but more careful explorers find upward-sloping spurs to the caves that lead to larger spaces clawed out from the ice. Here dwell the first of the Chasm's inhabitants, the Congregation of Gjaaki.": "从洞口处废弃的建筑物向下延伸，游客会发现一条迷宫般的冰隧道，因持续融水而变得湿滑。从这一点开始，他们就会被观察到。那些不留心或疲惫的游客会一头栽入更深的地方，但更谨慎的探险者会发现通往从冰中挖掘出的更大空间的上坡支脉。这里居住着深渊的第一批居民，(Gjaaki)的(Conregation)。",
	"The ice around you creaks and groans and the sound echoes frightfully in the cold, still darkness of the caves. There is no cutting blizzard wind, but the chill of the caves is a heavy thing. The cold pushes down until your throat aches and your bones feel stiff and strange. If you hold your breath and listen, you think you might hear movement in the shadows.": "你周围的冰发出吱吱作响的声音，在洞穴寒冷、静谧的黑暗中可怕地回荡着。这里没有刺骨的暴风雪，但洞穴的寒冷却是一种沉重的感觉。寒冷向下压迫，直到你的喉咙疼痛，骨头感到僵硬而奇怪。如果你屏住呼吸倾听，或许会听到阴影中的动静。",
	"How kuo-toa even reached the Nine Hells is unknown to scholars, but they dwell here in some numbers, farming albino fish in shallow pools and constructing for themselves a truly byzantine mythology. The Congregation are pallid, eyeless, and stealthy, stealing about the upper passages of the Chasm and sporadically descending on visitors, mortal and devil alike, to claim sacrifices for their complex pantheon of gods. Their theology is entirely unique, quite separate from their usual deities. They worship that which lies deeper within the caves and have constructed a whole idiolectic myth-cycle to account for their presence in the Chasm, which they see as the center of a cold and uncaring universe. They make pilgrimages into the depths, sacrifice each other or those that fall into their hands, and conduct meaningless rituals according to nonsensical texts carved into the ice. Sometimes their artisans venture to the cave mouth and create another fake ice dwelling to add to the lure of the caves.": "有关葵夸(Kuo-toa)族如何抵达九层地狱，学者们并不清楚，但他们在这里定居，养殖浅水池中的白化鱼，并为自己构建了一个极为复杂的神话。这些会众(The Congregation)苍白、无眼、潜行，悄悄地在峡谷的上层通道中穿行，偶尔下降到访客身上，无论是凡人还是恶魔，以供奉他们复杂的众神。他们的神学是完全独特的，与他们通常的神完全不同。他们崇拜那些深处洞穴的存在，并构建了一个完整的独特神话循环，以解释他们存在于峡谷中心，他们认为这是一个冷漠无情宇宙的中心。他们会朝着深处朝圣，相互或抓住他们手中的人进行牺牲，并根据雕刻在冰上的无意义文本进行毫无意义的仪式。有时，他们的工匠会冒险前往洞口，制造另一个虚假的冰居所，以增加洞穴的诱惑力。",
	"The Congregation is deranged and murderous, but luckier visitors might happen upon them when their bloodlust has been sated, or when their ritual calendar prescribes periods of contemplation. In times like these their philosophers are only too happy to talk about their beliefs for hours and hours, to the degrading sanity of their listeners.": "这个教众疯狂且凶残，但幸运的访客可能会在他们的嗜血欲望得到满足时遇见他们，或者在他们的仪式日历规定的冥想时期。在这样的时候，他们的哲学家会乐意花上几个小时甚至更长时间谈论他们的信仰，这会让听众的理智受到侵蚀。",
	"The Congregation consists of three dozen {@creature kuo-toa monitor||kuo-toa monitors} and a trio of {@creature kuo-toa archpriest||kuo-toa archpriests}. The kuo-toa are in a period of contemplation and therefore peaceful, if not attacked.

If a kuo-toa is attacked here, it summons all its brethren to defend it. If the entire kuo-toa populace in this area is slain, the characters recover 8,000 gp worth of various gems and other valuables.": "这个教众由三打{@creature kuo-toa monitor||kuo-toa monitors}和三个{@creature kuo-toa archpriest||kuo-toa archpriests}组成。这些夸托亚族正处于冥想期，因此和平，除非受到攻击。然而，他们如此疯狂以至于提供的信息稀少，角色需要花费大量时间在各个隧道之间移动才能遇到他们。如果这里的夸托亚族受到攻击，它会召唤所有同伴来保卫自己。如果这个地区的整个夸托亚族被杀死，角色将获得价值8000gp的各种宝石和其他贵重物品。",

Their torture is one of endless frustration, believing that within they can find riches grander than any they ever possessed in life. They're consumed by the desperate need to attain them.

	"There is a dripping sound in the cold tunnels. The space around you feels emptier, the walls have pulled away and the caves that lie ahead are vast and full of lakes of ink-dark water.

	"What is the Keeper of Found Things? Not a devil, certainly. Something ancient that has dwelled in the Chasm and tended its collection for longer than infernal records have been kept. A thing of the shadows that even the keenest eyes can never quite make out in detail or gain a complete picture of. Rambling accounts speak of too many arms, long-fingered hands, a twisted wedge of a head with a vertical mouth bristling with needle teeth. And a voice. A quiet, reasonable (so very reasonable) voice that speaks to mortals about salvation, rest, and peace—all the promises that lured them down into the caves past all those other tribulations. To forlorn devils, the Keeper instead whispers of a great and endless order, a perfect moment of torment perpetually prolonged. The Keeper has only terrible things to say, and yet it is hideously persuasive. Every moment of the journey through the caves goes to prepare its visitors to accept its blandishments. The Congregation's nonsense theology, the Echoes, the tentacled monsters thrashing blindly in the depths, all plant the seeds of surrender in the mind.": "`物之守护者`是什么？绝不是恶魔。它是一种古老存在，长久居住在深渊中，并且比地狱的记录还要久远地照料着它的收藏品。它是阴影中的存在，即使是最敏锐的眼睛也无法完全看清其细节或获得完整的画面。漫无目的的描述中提到了太多的手臂、长手指、一个带有垂直嘴巴和长满针齿的扭曲楔形头部。还有一种声音。一种安静、理性（非常理性）的声音，对凡人谈论救赎、安息和和平——所有诱使他们穿过所有那些磨难走进洞穴的诺言。对于绝望的恶魔，守护者却耳语着一个伟大而无尽的秩序，一个永无止境地延续的完美折磨时刻。守护者只说可怕的事情，然而它却极具说服力。穿越洞穴的旅程中的每一刻都是为了让访客接受它的花言巧语。`会众`的无稽神学、回声、在深渊中盲目挣扎的触手怪物，都在心灵中播下了屈服的种子。",

There are monsters, trapped forever—dimly glimpsed against the strange flat light that emanates from every direction. And there are the mortals and devils, hundreds of them, who came this far and no farther. Who couldn't resist the soft entreaties of the Keeper. Here is rest and peace and an endless perfect cruelty.

	"For those of stronger will, the ice itself reaches for them. The Keeper reshapes the very stuff of the Chasm to entrap less compliant victims by drawing forth frozen golems, gleaming facets flickering with echoes drawn from their victims' past. The luckiest might find their way back to the caves, to struggle against the slope and the water, braving all the perils they've already passed for the dubious safety of Stygia's surface.

This is an Amulet of Appearance ({@adventure see appendix D|CoA|16}) and if the character initially declines the purchase, the charming devil insists the character tries it on before deciding. A successful {@dc 15} Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check reveals it to be a magic amulet but not that it is cursed. If the character tries the amulet on, they transform. Any blemishes and imperfections vanish, they've never looked better. Audible gasps of approval can be heard from onlookers who see the transformation take place.": "在城市周围的摊位上翻找时，魅力值最低的角色被一个恶魔走近，提议以600金币出售一枚强大的护身符。这是一枚外貌护身符({@adventure see appendix D|CoA|16})，如果角色最初拒绝购买，迷人的恶魔会坚持让角色试戴后再决定。成功的{@dc 15}智慧({@skill Insight})检定会揭示它是一枚魔法护身符，但不会揭示它是被诅咒的。如果角色戴上护身符，他们会发生变化。任何瑕疵和缺陷都会消失，他们看起来前所未有地美丽。旁观者听到变化发生时发出的赞许声。",
	"Near the bottom of the layer also lies Maggoth Thyg, a mysterious cavern from which no creature ever returns. Even the devils native to Malbolge fear Maggoth Thyg, claiming it has existed far longer than the Nine Hells. The characters should know to be wary of a location that even the denizens of the Nine Hells are fearful of.": "在地层的底部附近还有Maggoth Thyg（玛戈斯·泰格）, 一个神秘的洞穴，从那里没有任何生物返回过。即使是马尔博尔吉（Malbolge）的恶魔也害怕Maggoth Thyg（玛戈斯·泰格），声称它存在的时间比九层地狱还要久远。角色应该知道要谨慎对待连九层地狱的居民都害怕的地点。",
	"If the characters decide to go in search of Maggoth Thyg despite the obvious perils, have them venture for four hours towards a cavern system at the bottom of Malbolge. When they get close to the area where they expect to find the cave, the ground is scattered with corpses. If they insist on venturing at least another hour further, roll on the {@adventure Random Temptations|CoA|2|Random Temptations} table from chapter 2.": "如果角色决定尽管明显的危险还是要去寻找Maggoth Thyg，让他们朝着马尔博尔吉（Malbolge）底部的一个洞穴系统冒险四个小时。当他们接近他们期望找到洞穴的地方时，地面上散布着尸体。如果他们坚持再冒险至少一个小时，就在第二章的{@adventure Random Temptations|CoA|2|Random Temptations}表上进行投掷。",
	"Another landmark utilizing Malagard's remains in its construction is the Sign of the Hag's Arms. This multi-leveled structure rises out from the ground near a place where many tunnels and thoroughfares cross paths. One of the hag's dismembered arms serves as a gruesome marker for this location, which {@creature Koh Tam|CoA} deems the most likely to house what the characters seek.": "另一个利用马拉加德(Malagard)遗迹建造的地标是《女巫臂章》(Sign of the Hag's Arms)。这座多层建筑物从地面上升起，靠近许多隧道和道路交汇的地方。女巫的一个被肢解的手臂被用作这个地点的恐怖标记，{@creature Koh Tam|CoA}认为这里最有可能藏有角色们寻找的东西。",
	"The Hag's Arms is run by hags, of course, the entrepreneurs of the lower planes. There are three of them, as is traditional, each with her own specialty, each a powerful magician beyond the regular dreams of her kind. Irabella runs the inn and kitchen, the night hag Malacki tinkers on hideous creations in her underground workshops, and {@creature Anacreda|CoA} the Angelmaker is the coven's undisputed leader.": "{@creature Anacreda|CoA} 处理酒馆的是当然是由女巫们经营，她们是下层位面的企业家。按照传统，有三位女巫，每位都有自己的专长，每位都是超越她们种族常规梦想的强大魔法师。伊拉贝拉经营客栈和厨房，夜行女巫玛拉奇在她的地下车间里修补着可怕的创造物，而{@creature Anacreda|CoA}“天使制造者”则是女巫团的无可争议的领袖。",
	"When the characters first enter Malbolge, {@creature Koh Tam|CoA} or {@creature Tiax|CoA} impart the following knowledge about the layer to them:": "当角色们第一次进入Malbolge时，{@creature Koh Tam|CoA}或{@creature Tiax|CoA}向他们传授关于这个层面的以下知识：",
	"{@creature Koh Tam|CoA} explains the windswept and endless slopes of this new layer of the Nine Hells, \"In Malbolge there is no level ground, but always the strength-sapping slog of up or down, and the going is riven with crevasses and the colossal, eternal remains of Malagard, the former ruler of this layer, constantly festering but never decaying away.\"": "{@creature Koh Tam|CoA}解释了九层地狱的这一新层的风吹草动和无尽斜坡，“在玛尔博尔格，没有平地，只有不断消耗体力的上下坡路，道路上布满了裂缝和巨大的、永恒的玛拉加德的遗骸，这位前统治者的遗骸不断腐烂，却永远不会消失。”",
	"\"There are tunnels, lairs for such fauna as calls Malbolge home: the insects and spiders with their kin, in swarms and of huge size.

The things have adapted their natural weapons and strategy to prey on fiends, though they will take mortals gladly.\"": "\"有隧道，是马尔博尔格之家的各种动物的巢穴：昆虫和蜘蛛及其同类，成群结队，体型巨大。有人说它们是从玛拉加德巨大的肉体散播的腐化中产生的。这些生物已经适应了它们的天然武器和策略，以猎食恶魔，尽管它们也乐意捕食凡人。\"",
	"He toes a clump of profane soil, releasing numerous scuttling insects that flee into the dirt below and then continues, \"But those, devil, or mortal, who lament the cheerless character of the plane should dampen their enthusiasm when the Sign of the Hag's Arms comes into sight. Hospitality is to be had there, it's true, but not every guest who enters its doors has the luxury of checking out again.\"": "他踩到一团亵渎的泥土，释放出许多匆匆逃入地下的昆虫，然后继续说道：“但是，无论是恶魔还是凡人，如果为这片荒凉的地方感到悲哀，当看到女巫之臂的标记时，就应该冷静下来。那里确实提供了款待，但并非每位进入其门的客人都有幸再次离开。”",
	"They should visit The Sign of the Hag's Arms, where they might start looking for answers. But he warns them: the hags are powerful adversaries.": "他们应该去拜访（The Sign of the Hag's Arms）, 在那里他们可能会开始寻找答案。但他警告他们：女巫是强大的对手。",

	"Some of the major locations found in and around the inn are described below.": "以下是关于旅馆周围一些主要地点的描述。",
	"You stand upon the lower slopes of a great uprising of earth. A well-worn path curves upwards but a fetid mist hangs low, allowing only the murky outline of a building crouching upon the hilltop above. Closer to you there appear to be numerous, less-worn paths, leading into various crevices and small canyons.": "你站在一个巨大的地势上升的低处。一条磨损严重的小路蜿蜒而上，但一股恶臭的雾气低垂，只能看到山顶上蹲着的建筑物的模糊轮廓。离你更近的地方似乎有许多不太熟悉的小径，通向各种裂缝和小峡谷。",
	"The inn sits at a confluence of chasm and tunnel thoroughfares between infernal fortresses, in a particularly perilous region of the plane. Perilous more for Fiends than for travelers from outside the lower planes. From long feeding on the toxic flesh of Malagard—perhaps helped along by the tinkering of the inn's proprietors—the local life has developed some potent weapons to deploy against devils. In place of the regular poisons that Fiends are immune to, many species of {@creature giant scorpion||giant scorpions} and {@creature giant spider||giant spiders} inject acid with their stingers and fangs, or even more bizarre fluids that sear like the radiant touch of angels, rendering down fiendish flesh into a readily ingestible soup.": "客栈坐落在地狱堡垒之间的峡谷和隧道交汇处，在位于该位面特别危险的地区。这个地方对于外来自下位面的旅行者来说并不那么危险，但对恶魔来说却是危险重重。由于长期食用Malagard的有毒肉体——或许还得益于客栈老板的改良——当地的生物已经发展出一些强大的武器来对抗恶魔。许多种类的{@creature giant scorpion||giant scorpions}和{@creature giant spider||giant spiders}不再注射对恶魔无效的常规毒素，而是用它们的刺和毒牙注射酸液，甚至更奇异的液体，像天使的光辉之触一样灼烧，将恶魔的肉体溶解成易于食用的汤。",
	"The tumultuous air above isn't safe either, as flights of {@creature ayperobo swarm|CoA|ayperobo swarms} ({@adventure see appendix B|CoA|14}) issue from their crevice nests, eager to devour prey. Those devils tasked to take messages and goods through the region of the inn always hurry to take shelter there, no matter the risks, and mortal travelers would be advised to do the same.": "上方混乱的空气也并不安全，因为{@creature ayperobo swarm|CoA|ayperobo swarms} ({@adventure see appendix B|CoA|14}) 从它们的裂缝巢穴中飞出，渴望捕食猎物。那些被派遣在旅馆地区传递消息和货物的恶魔总是匆忙寻找庇护所，不顾一切风险，凡人旅行者最好也效仿。",
	"Approaching travelers are set upon by {@dice 2d6} {@creature giant scorpion||giant scorpions} and {@dice 2d6} {@creature giant spider||giant spiders} that crawl out from the various crevices around them.

	"Any giant insects encountered in Malbolge deal acid damage instead of poison damage and each of their attacks deals an additional 4 ({@damage 1d8}) radiant damage. These insects also have resistance to acid, poison, and fire damage.": "在马尔波奇(Malbolge)遇到的巨型昆虫造成酸性伤害，而不是毒性伤害，并且它们的每次攻击额外造成4({@damage 1d8})辐射伤害。这些昆虫还对酸性、毒性和火焰伤害具有抗性。",
	"You notice numerous gashes on stone outcroppings, crevices, and the ground itself, that apparently form the entrance to tunnels, leading into a darkness below. Peering into an opening, you see a network of tunnels and chambers illuminated by a soft, pulsing glow and hear the faint sound of scraping and digging. The tunnels are lined with hardened earth, and seemingly form a complex labyrinthine network. The air is thick and humid, carrying the scent of dirt and decay.": "你注意到岩石露头、裂缝和地面上有许多伤口，似乎形成了通往地下黑暗的隧道入口。凝视着一个开口，你看到一片由柔和、跳动的光芒照亮的隧道和房间网络，并听到微弱的刮擦和挖掘声音。隧道内壁覆盖着硬化的土壤，似乎形成了一个复杂的迷宫网络。空气浓重而潮湿，弥漫着泥土和腐烂的气味。",
	"Malecki provides {@creature Ekengarik|CoA} with ever more noxious underlings to serve her hive, and she in turn ensures that travelers in the locale are 'encouraged' to visit the inn, and those trying to escape without paying their due meet a sorry end. It was {@creature Ekengarik|CoA} that sent the swarm of insects towards the characters earlier. {@creature Ekengarik|CoA} (see accompanying stat block) wants to drive the characters to the inn, but her patience is limited. Keep track of this by using a counter. The counter starts at 1 if the giant insects have been slain, zero otherwise, and for each hour the characters spend in the hive, and each time a fiendish formian is slain, it increases by +1. Once this counter reaches 6, {@creature Ekengarik|CoA} uses Dimension Door and attacks, generally starting battle with Prismatic Wall to separate the characters from going deeper into her hive. If at any point the characters retreat, she allows them.": "Malecki为她的蜂巢提供越来越多的有毒下属，而她则确保当地的旅行者被“鼓励”去拜访客栈，那些试图逃避付款的人则会遭遇不幸。正是{@creature Ekengarik|CoA}之前派遣了一群昆虫朝着角色们。{@creature Ekengarik|CoA}（见附带的属性块）想要把角色们驱赶到客栈，但她的耐心有限。通过计数器来跟踪这一点。如果巨型昆虫已被击败，则计数器从1开始，否则为零；每当角色在蜂巢中度过一个小时，或每次击败一个邪恶的蚁人形态，计数器就会增加+1。一旦计数器达到6，{@creature Ekengarik|CoA}会使用《次元之门》发动攻击，通常会以五彩墙开始战斗，将角色们与深入她的蜂巢分开。如果角色们任何时候撤退，她会允许他们。",
	"Most corridors in the hive are 5 feet wide, 10 feet tall, and extend in stretches for 50-90 feet before turning sharply. A variety of stones, wooden debris, and various items collected over the years, has been partly cemented into the tunnel walls.

Over and over again his energy is painfully sucked out of him to sustain the taskmaster that controls him. Once the imp collapses in exhaustion the taskmaster moves away, coming back for more once he needs sustenance again. The imp is in truth the character's old mentor transformed to undergo this torment. To rescue them the character has to defeat the formian that is treating their old master as a snack.

	"Read the following as the characters approach the inn.": "当角色们走近客栈时，请阅读以下内容。",
	"The Sign of the Hag's Arms is well, if bleakly, named. The outer courtyard sits in the crook of one of Malagard's lesser limbs, or at least a recognizable fragment of the same. Within this elbow space the upper level of the inn itself is made entirely from the ancient hag's substance, bones as scaffolding, leathery skin stretched out as a vaned roof, the walls built of tessellated teeth and ragged plates of nails. As a feat of architecture, it is simultaneously impressive and nauseating.": "(`The Sign of the Hag's Arms`)的招牌取得不错，虽然有点冷酷。外庭位于(Malagard)的一个较小的肢体弯曲处，或者至少是同一个的一个可识别的碎片。在这个弯曲的空间里，客栈本身的上层完全由古老的女巫物质构成，骨骼作为脚手架，皮革般的皮肤伸展成有翼的屋顶，墙壁由镶嵌的牙齿和锈蚀的钉片构成。作为一项建筑壮举，它既令人印象深刻又令人恶心。",
	"Had the plane's current ruler, {@creature Glasya|CoA}, any respect for her predecessor then doubtless the construction would be counted as deep disrespect. {@creature Glasya|CoA} isn't sentimental, however, and Malbolge offers little else in respect of building material. Even the iron of the infernal fortresses must be hauled in from more productive layers. As with most locations in Malbolge, the inn continues on many levels under the ground. There are always guest rooms to be had, for a price. The proprietors accept a variety of currencies. {@item Soul Coin|CoA|Soul Coins}, most commonly, but also magic objects or rare ingredients, given the work all three tend to. Devils passing this way know to bring appropriate recompense for the shelter, but mortals may be dismayed to find that all their gold and gems buy them nothing. However, there are always other options for those visiting from other planes. Not necessarily palatable options.": "如果飞机的现任统治者{@creature Glasya|CoA}对她的前任有任何尊重的话，那么毫无疑问，这种建筑将被视为极度的不敬。然而，{@creature Glasya|CoA}并不多愁善感，而马尔博尔格在建筑材料方面提供的选择很少。即使是地狱堡垒的铁也必须从更具生产力的层中运来。与马尔博尔格的大多数地点一样，旅馆在地下有许多层。总有客房可供使用，但需付出代价。业主接受各种货币，其中{@item Soul Coin|CoA|Soul Coins}最常见，但也接受魔法物品或稀有成分，考虑到它们三者的作用。路过这里的恶魔知道要带来适当的报酬以换取庇护，但凡人可能会惊讶地发现他们所有的黄金和宝石都无法买到什么。然而，对于那些来自其他位面的访客，总是有其他选择。不一定是令人愉快的选择。",

At the top of the staircase lies a long hallway with many doors, the first pair of which are open. Through them you see a great feasting hall with a host of long tables covered in heaps of food. Most of it seems to be meat.

Mortals are advised to bring their own lunches unless they have a cast iron immunity to poisons.": "在客栈的一楼发现了一个宏伟的宴会厅，通常每时每刻都至少有二十个恶魔在那里。他们在用马拉加德(Malagard)的骨头雕刻而成的桌子上肘部相互挤压，享用独特的菜单。马拉加德的肉通常即使对恶魔来说也难以下咽，但客栈的老板们有将其变成值得恶魔前来一趟的美味的技巧。除非有对毒药有铸铁般的免疫力，否则建议凡人自带午餐。",

Unfortunately, the narrow corridors make it almost impossible to avoid contact with them. A putrid smell hangs in the air.": "客房占据了客栈大部分的上层空间。墙壁看起来像是有机的，散发着一种令人不安的温暖。不幸的是，狭窄的走廊几乎让人无法避免与它们接触。空气中弥漫着一股腐臭的气味。",
	"The guest rooms themselves are comfortable enough, if one doesn't contemplate the materials used to furnish them. There are six double bedrooms on each level.": "客房本身还算舒适，如果不去考虑用来装饰它们的材料的话。每层有六间双人卧室。",
	"Below all of this—the rooms, the hall, the unspeakable kitchens—are the workshops, for the three old women who run the inn have another business they conduct here. Business that draws infernal patrons from every layer of the Nine Hells.": "在这一切之下——房间、大厅、无法言说的厨房——是车间，三位老妇人经营着这家旅馆的另一门生意。这门生意吸引了来自九层地狱各个阶层的地狱客。",
	"The work of the hags, when they aren't playing hostess to select visitors, is in the construction of monsters. The secret lies in the flesh of Malagard, which is infinitely dead yet simultaneously bubbling with corrosive and stinking life. Using carefully selected components harvested from the ancient archdevil, adding in parts, pieces, and rare ingredients collected from across the Nine Hells and beyond, they create new beings with independent existence and will. For, while they lack the divine spark that would permit them to create true life, still the carrion flesh of Malagard holds enough vitality to grant a permanent animation to their stitched-together creations. The secret of how they harness the deceased hag-mother's power is known only to the three of them and represents their last bargaining chip should the powers of the Nine Hells decide their tenure is at an end.": "当那些女巫们不在招待特定访客时，她们的工作就是制造怪物。秘密在于马拉加德(Malagard)的血肉，它无限地死去，却同时冒着腐蚀和恶臭的生命。她们从古老的大恶魔那里精心挑选组件，再加入从九层地狱及更远处收集来的部件、碎片和稀有材料，创造出拥有独立存在和意志的新生物。尽管她们缺乏创造真正生命所需的神圣火花，但马拉加德的腐肉仍然蕴含足够的活力，使她们拼凑在一起的创造物永久地具有生命。她们如何利用已故的女巫母亲的力量的秘密只有她们三个人知道，这也是她们最后的筹码，如果九层地狱的力量决定她们的任期结束。",
	"While the basements are sealed off from the rest of the inn, there are no guards when the hags are off dealing with guests. The basements are accessible through an iron door that has Arcane Lock on it. Read the following if the characters decide to investigate:": "尽管地下室与客栈的其余部分隔离开来，但当女巫们忙于招待客人时，并没有守卫。地下室可通过一扇铁门进入，门上施有奥术锁。如果角色决定进行调查，请阅读以下内容：",
	"The basement of the inn is a huge cavern carved from the rock. Arches of bone are built into the walls of the cavern for some unknown purpose. What looks like an angel hangs slackly from hooks on the ceiling; it seems to have been constructed out of the body parts of angels and devils.": "客栈的地下室是一个巨大的岩石洞穴。骨头拱门嵌入了洞穴的墙壁，用于某种未知目的。一个看起来像天使的东西无力地挂在天花板上的钩子上；它似乎是由天使和恶魔的身体部分构建而成。",
	"This cavern is where the creations that the hags are currently working on are found. The angel doesn't have a spark of life as of yet, but if {@creature Anacreda|CoA} feels threatened she can awaken her creation. The angel is a {@creature planetar} that is considered a lawful evil Construct. It doesn't have its spellcasting feature. If the characters are here peacefully, review the \"Services\" section, for a description of what the hags might offer the characters, and ask for in return.": "这个洞穴是女巫们目前正在努力创造的地方。天使目前还没有生命的迹象，但如果{@creature Anacreda|CoA}感到受到威胁，她可以唤醒她的创造物。这个天使是一个被认为是秩序邪恶的构造体。它没有施法特性。如果角色们在这里和平相处，请查看“服务”部分，了解女巫们可能为角色们提供的服务，并询问他们想要什么作为回报。",
	"A curious splash draws your attention to an area of the basement dotted with large pools of brackish water. Amidst the pools, a green-skinned woman is partly submerged within a large iron-clad bathtub, set upon a wheeled platform. She is leaning out of the tub, studying various body parts arranged on a table before her. The waters of the brackish pools ripple continuously, as if something large moves beneath their surfaces.": "一个奇怪的溅水声引起了你的注意，你看到地下室的一个区域散布着大片混浊水池。在水池中间，一个绿皮肤的女人部分浸没在一个装在轮式平台上的大铁皮浴缸里。她身体倾斜在浴缸外，正在研究摆放在她面前桌子上的各种身体部位。混浊水池的水面不断泛起涟漪，仿佛有什么大物在水下移动。",
	"Irabella the hag (Irabella uses the {@creature archmage} stat block, but her creature type is Fey) seldom leaves her great wheeled bath, that is hauled laboriously about the ramps and elevators of the inn by the staff of {@creature kobold||kobolds} she commands. Her workshops are half-submerged, and here she creates aquatic monstrosities on demand. Great Sahuagin priestkings, aboleth archmages and elder kraken all send emissaries to her, and she makes benthic terrors to trouble the dreams of sea gods. She is sharp and bitter in manner, abusive to her servants and needling to her patrons and sisters, but she also commands the day-to-day running of the inn and its kitchens, tedious work the other two have no taste for. Hence her constant barbs are endured.": "海妖伊拉贝拉（Irabella使用{@creature archmage}状态块，但她的生物类型是精灵）很少离开她的大型轮式浴缸，这个浴缸由她指挥的{@creature kobold||kobolds}的员工费力地推上旅馆的斜坡和电梯。她的工作坊半沉在水中，在这里她按需创造水生怪物。伟大的鲨人祭司王、深渊法师和上古巨章鱼都派遣使者前来拜访她，她制造深海恐怖来困扰海神的梦境。她言辞尖刻且狠毒，对待仆人咄咄逼人，对待顾客和姐妹们则挑剔刁钻，但她也指挥着旅馆和厨房的日常运营，这是其他两位不感兴趣的乏味工作。因此，她的刺痛话语总是被忍受着。",
	"Each pool is 150 feet deep and connected to one another. The creature in the pool is a lawful evil {@creature dragon turtle} stripped of most of its shell but imbued with infernal energies (Legendary Resistance 2/Day and its Steam Breath deals necrotic damage instead of fire damage). If any pool is disturbed, or Irabella is attacked while in this room, the dragon turtle attacks. During battle, it uses its movement to slip through the tunnels connecting the pools, to position itself tactically, as required.": "每个池塘深150英尺，彼此相连。池塘中的生物是一个秩序邪恶{@creature dragon turtle}，虽然大部分壳被剥去，但却注入了地狱能量（传奇抗性 2/天，其蒸汽吐息造成死灵伤害而非火焰伤害）。如果任何池塘被打扰，或者Irabella在这个房间里受到攻击，龙龟就会发动攻击。在战斗中，它利用移动穿过连接池塘的隧道，根据需要采取战术位置。",

	"As soon as the character searching for the phylactery containing their mother's soul enters this room, they hear her voice whisper their name. But her voice sounds like she's trapped under water, and it's distorted. Each hour they may make a {@dc 17} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to try to find her. Only that character can make the check, and no one can help them with it. If they fail the check there is a 1 in 6 chance that Irabella, if not previously encountered, enters the room and confronts them. Once found, the characters are able to retrieve their mother's phylactery from beneath the brackish waters.": "当角色寻找包含母亲灵魂的护身符进入这个房间时，他们听到她的声音在耳边轻声呢喃他们的名字。但她的声音听起来像是被困在水下，并且被扭曲了。每小时他们可以进行一次{@dc 17}智力({@skill Investigation})检定来尝试找到她。只有该角色可以进行检定，没有人可以帮助他们。如果他们未通过检定，有1/6的几率伊拉贝拉，如果之前未遇到过，会进入房间并与他们对抗。一旦找到，角色们就能从混浊的水下取回他们母亲的护身符。",

An elf woman is apparently tending to the creature.": "透过两根骨柱间的缝隙，你看到各种大型围栏，周围都是骨墙。一个巨大的野兽被锁在中央一个围栏里，它的头上长满长牙，身体布满尖刺。一个精灵女人显然正在照料这个生物。",
	"Malecki, who claims to be the direct descendant of Malagard, is a {@creature night hag} (with 150 hit points) whose work is on a grand scale. Her workshops are huge caverns in the rock, supplied with arches of bone that serve as gates from which her creations can leave, too vast to navigate the physical tunnels to the surface. She calls her work 'bespoke behemoths', living war engines of armor and tusks and spines, and she is happy to deliver them via her gates direct to a battlefield of her patron's choice if required. Malecki appears as plump and cheerful and is absolutely not to be trusted under any circumstance. Her creations are of undeniable power but are best released and then avoided as they've a tendency to forget who their master is soon after being deployed.": "马莱基（Malecki）声称是马拉加德（Malagard）的直系后裔，是一名{@creature night hag}（拥有150点生命值）的工匠，其作品规模宏大。她的工坊是巨大的岩洞，里面有供应骨骼拱门，作为她的创造物离开的门户，这些创造物太庞大，无法穿越地下通道到达地表。她称自己的作品为“定制巨兽”，是由盔甲、獠牙和脊椎组成的生物战争机器，如果需要，她很乐意通过她的门直接将它们送到赞助者选择的战场上。马莱基看起来丰满和开朗，但绝对不能在任何情况下信任。她的创造物具有不可否认的力量，但最好释放它们后远离，因为它们往往会在部署后不久忘记谁是它们的主人。",
	"Malecki is still working on her latest creation, a yet-to-be-named fiendish war-machine (uses the statistics of a {@creature goristro} demon). It is tethered by a magical chain with a length of 5 feet (though given the creature's size, it is capable of reaching much further than that). Currently it is docile and apparently tolerates, if not enjoys, Malecki's grotesque surgery. If she is attacked, Malecki uses a bonus action to free it from the chain, and the creature defends her.": "Malecki仍在致力于她的最新创作，一台尚未命名的恶毒战争机器(使用{@creature goristro}恶魔的统计数据)。它被一根长度为5英尺的魔法链条所束缚（尽管考虑到生物的大小，它能够达到更远的距离）。目前它温顺，显然容忍，甚至享受Malecki的怪诞手术。如果她受到攻击，Malecki会使用一个奖励动作来解开链条，生物会为她辩护。",
	"Malecki carries a strange amulet in one of her robe's many pockets. This is a cursed item known as the Amulet of Duplicity ({@adventure see appendix D|CoA|16}).": "Malecki在她的长袍口袋中携带着一个奇怪的护身符。这是一个被称为复制护身符的诅咒物品({@adventure see appendix D|CoA|16})。",
	"A workshop that also appears to be used for the storage of spare creature parts is tucked away on the opposite side of the other basement chambers. Shelves line many of the walls, floor to ceiling, and upon those shelves sit several iron cannisters full of feathers of various plumages and colors.": "在地下室的另一侧，有一个看起来也被用来存放备用生物部件的车间。许多墙壁从地板到天花板都有架子，架子上摆放着几个铁罐，里面装满了各种羽毛，颜色和羽毛种类繁多。",
	"A hideous winged woman is apparently examining the paraphernalia, though it is unclear whether she is looking for something or simply admiring the collection. Her dove-grey wings twitch, as she glances over her shoulder in your direction. She asks, \"Are you here to commission a build, or have you arrived to offer my sisters and I a discount on the used body parts of one of your companions?\"": "一位丑陋的有翅膀的女人显然正在检查这些器具，尽管不清楚她是在寻找什么还是仅仅在欣赏这个收藏。她那鸽灰色的翅膀抽搐了一下，当她朝你的方向扫视时。她问道：“你是来委托建造的，还是来给我和我的姐妹们提供你同伴的旧身体部件打折？”",
	"Finally, there is {@creature Anacreda|CoA} the Angelmaker, the leader of the coven. {@creature Anacreda|CoA} (see accompanying stat block) makes beasts of the air and bears a great pair of dove-grey wings herself, a living advertisement of her skills. She is only ever hideous, never bothering to disguise her true visage, but at the same time she has a stern grandeur to her that strikes Fiends and mortals both with its gravity and awe. Nobody has tested her to find out how personally powerful she is, but when {@creature Glasya|CoA} herself comes to visit it is {@creature Anacreda|CoA} she guests with. The two of them sit for hours, drinking peculiar vintages and exchanging secrets. And, while {@creature Glasya|CoA} is the one entity whom {@creature Anacreda|CoA} visibly defers to as her superior, the archdevil treats the ancient hag better than most of her own direct subordinates.": "最后，{@creature Anacreda|CoA}是“天使制造者”，这个女巫团的领袖。{@creature Anacreda|CoA}（见附带的属性块）能够制造空中的野兽，她自己拥有一双巨大的鸽灰色翅膀，是她技能的生动广告。她从不掩饰自己真实的面容，总是丑陋的，但同时她有一种严肃的威严，这种威严让邪魔和凡人都感到她的庄严和敬畏。没有人敢尝试测试她的个人实力，但当{@creature Glasya|CoA}亲自造访时，她会与{@creature Anacreda|CoA}共进晚餐。她们两人坐在一起数小时，喝着奇特的美酒，交换着秘密。虽然{@creature Glasya|CoA}是唯一一个{@creature Anacreda|CoA}明显尊敬的实体，大恶魔对待这位古老的丑陋女巫比对待自己的直接下属还要好。",
	"As well as making monsters to order, the three sisters keep up a busy trade in exotic components and pieces, part of a network of speculators, harvesters and collectors that spans the planes. In addition, they happily modify Fiends and even mortals. They replace and add limbs, senses, and organs, both on request from those seeking greater personal power, and to fulfill specific punishments for recalcitrant Fiends that {@creature Glasya|CoA} sends to them. Because they represent an unusual little blister of relative lawlessness in the Nine Hells, the sisters have also been known to hide fugitive mortals from infernal pursuit, for a price—though they're also not averse to taking payment and then betraying their guests, if they're feeling treacherous. The three sisters of the Hag's Arms are anything but reliable collaborators save where their business partners are too powerful to play games with.": "除了定制怪物外，这三姐妹还忙着经营异国的组件和零件贸易，他们是一个跨越位面的投机者、收割者和收藏家网络的一部分。此外，她们乐意修改邪魔甚至凡人。她们会根据需求替换和添加肢体、感官和器官，既是为了那些寻求更强个人力量的人，也是为了执行{@creature Glasya|CoA}派遣给她们的特定惩罚，以对付桀骜不驯的邪魔。由于她们在九层地狱中代表了一个相对无法无天的小团体，这三姐妹也以帮助逃避地狱追捕的凡人而闻名，当然要收取一定的代价——尽管她们也不排斥收取报酬然后背叛客人，如果她们感到背叛。哈格之臂的三姐妹绝不是可靠的合作伙伴，除非她们的商业伙伴实在太强大，无法玩弄。",
	"When mortals do beg their services, the required payment varies. Most often they might simply ask for one member of the visiting group—as a plaything, for their soul, or to trade on to some fiendish creditor. As mortals are oddly reluctant to enter into that kind of transaction, they take other services. There is almost always some rare component one or another sister is after for her latest creation, and they've devised a variety of powerful geas-type bindings to ensure that any agreement isn't reneged on. They particularly like effects that have their errand-runners gradually mutate or deteriorate the longer the task remains undone. In game terms, any Geas they cast works as if it was cast at 9th level. In addition, the geas can only be ended with the {@spell Wish} spell or by killing the hag that cast the spell.": "当凡人请求她们的服务时，所需的付款各不相同。最常见的情况是她们可能只是要求访问团队中的一名成员——作为玩物、换取灵魂，或者转卖给某个邪恶的债权人。由于凡人对参与这种交易有些犹豫，她们会提供其他服务。几乎总会有某个姐妹为她最新的创作寻找一些稀有成分，她们设计了各种强大的类似祝福的约束，以确保任何协议不会被违背。她们特别喜欢那些让使者逐渐变异或恶化的效果，这种效果会随着任务未完成的时间而加剧。在游戏术语中，她们施放的任何祝福都会像是以9级施放的一样。此外，这个祝福只能通过{@spell Wish}法术或杀死施放该法术的女巫来终止。",
	"All three sisters appreciate things that are in short supply in the Nine Hells. A bard's skilled performance, some witty repartee and a challenging game of skill might serve just as well as a quest across all the known planes for a piece of an ancient monster still currently within its original owner. Until you go before them, cap in hand, it's impossible to know how hard a bargain the hags will drive.": "在九层地狱中，三位姐妹都欣赏那些稀缺的东西。一位诗人娴熟的表演，一些机智的回应和一场具有挑战性的技能游戏可能会像穿越所有已知位面寻找一块仍在原主手中的古代怪物碎片一样有效。在你跪地求饶之前，很难知道这些女巫会讨价还价到何种程度。",
	"Risk-taking characters might want the hags to help them survive the dangers of the Nine Hells. Roll on the Hag Parts table... this is the modification available currently (this might change the next time the characters visit Malbolge).

Roll on the Bad Deal table.": "喜欢冒险的角色可能希望寻求女巫的帮助，帮助他们在九层地狱的危险中生存下来。在女巫零件表上进行投掷……目前可以使用的修改是（这在角色下次访问玛尔博尔格时可能会改变）。如果支付3 {@item Soul Coin|CoA|Soul Coins} 的代价，一个角色在经过 {@dice 2d4} 小时的手术后获得这个修改。然而，几乎总会有一个弊端。在糟糕交易表上进行投掷。",
	"The hags can apply a patchwork collection of skin to the character, granting the character immunity to either fire or cold damage (character picks before surgery).": "这些女巫可以将一系列拼接的皮肤贴在角色身上，使角色对火焰或寒冷伤害免疫（手术前角色选择）。",

Alternatively, if the characters defeat {@creature Anacreda|CoA} and her sisters in combat, the hag bargains for her life by offering up both the scourge and {@creature Glasya|CoA}. The archdevil visits often, usually without any guard. What could be a better revenge for the characters, than killing the daughter of {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}? The hag is more than willing to help set an ambush for the archdevil.": "如果角色们正在寻找{@item Scourge of Shadow|CoA}，{@creature Anacreda|CoA}想要与他们达成交易。她希望{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}的总司令{@creature Abigor|CoA}的头颅，以报复他上次访问小酒馆时对她的轻蔑。{@creature Anacreda|CoA}承诺会取得这个祸害，但前提是他们同意接受{@spell Geas}法术的施加。另外，如果角色们在战斗中击败{@creature Anacreda|CoA}和她的姐妹，那个女巫会通过提供祸害和{@creature Glasya|CoA}来讨价还价以换取她的性命。大执政魔鬼经常造访，通常没有任何护卫。对于角色们来说，有什么比杀死{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}的女儿更好的报复呢？那个女巫非常乐意帮助设伏大执政魔鬼。",
	"When {@creature Glasya|CoA} ({@adventure see appendix A|CoA|13}) arrives, {@creature Anacreda|CoA} sits with her and serves a frothing tea that both consume.

As soon as {@creature Glasya|CoA} finishes her tea, {@creature Anacreda|CoA} beckons the characters from the shadows to attack. During combat, the hag uses her Spinewall to disrupt and corral {@creature Glasya|CoA} and she claws at the archdevil as long as the characters are nearby to assist. {@creature Glasya|CoA} doesn't seem overly surprised at the betrayal—this is the way of the Nine Hells after all.": "当{@creature Glasya|CoA}({@adventure see appendix A|CoA|13})到达时，{@creature Anacreda|CoA}和她坐在一起，倒了一杯起泡的茶，两人都喝了。如果{@creature Anacreda|CoA}正在合作伏击大恶魔，那么茶会以以下方式削弱{@creature Glasya|CoA}。{@creature Glasya|CoA}在马尔波尔吉无法使用她的召唤手下、邪恶再生或迷人凝视能力1周。当{@creature Glasya|CoA}喝完茶后，{@creature Anacreda|CoA}从阴影中招呼角色进行攻击。在战斗中，这个女巫使用她的脊椎墙来干扰和围困{@creature Glasya|CoA}，并在角色附近协助时抓向大恶魔。{@creature Glasya|CoA}似乎对背叛并不感到过分惊讶——毕竟这是九层地狱的方式。",

Two of the cities the characters might choose to visit: Grenpoli and Gorloron. The city of Grenpoli serves as a welcome safe haven for many. Within its walls all forms of aggression are forbidden. The city of Gorloron, the latest of {@creature Baalzebul|CoA}'s vanity projects, will no doubt be surpassed by an even more ambitious metropolis in the future. Besides the cities, the characters can explore the Carnival Eternal.

In between the deforestation lie strip mines, surface mines, and processing facilities that belch smog and toxins into the air. Any water that once existed has turned to sludge, save only for the secluded Styx. The layer is truly a testament to {@creature Baalzebul|CoA}'s failure in his search for perfection.": "在其鼎盛时期，（Maladomini）是一个美丽的天堂，拥有各种不同的生态系统和郁郁葱葱的植被。不幸的是，现在唯一剩下的森林要么正在腐烂，要么已经死去，再也找不到野生动物或美丽的景色。在这些砍伐过的地区之间，散布着露天矿、露天矿和排放烟雾和毒素的加工设施。曾经存在的水源已经变成了淤泥，只有隐蔽的（Styx）例外。这一层实在是对{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}在追求完美中失败的真实见证。",
	"Each of the ruins covering the realm is more spectacular than the last. During their construction, {@creature Baalzebul|CoA} wanted each to be his ultimate metropolis and spared no expense. Even in their detritus they remain grotesquely beautiful. Occasional treasure hunters from other planes explore the ruins in search of treasure, and many escaped devils or souls hide deep inside. The overexploitation of the surrounding lands makes the ruins some of the safest spots in the layer, and they remain largely forgotten by the ruling archdevil.": "每一个遍布王国的废墟都比上一个更壮观。在建造过程中，{@creature Baalzebul|CoA} 想要每一个都成为他的终极大都会，不惜一切。即使在废墟中，它们仍然保持着怪诞而美丽的风采。来自其他位面的偶尔的寻宝者会探索这些废墟，寻找宝藏，许多逃脱的恶魔或灵魂深藏其中。周围土地的过度开发使这些废墟成为该层中一些最安全的地方，它们在很大程度上被统治的大恶魔遗忘了。",
	"Despite his disloyalty to {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}, {@creature Baalzebul|CoA} remains the archdevil in charge of Maladomini. His rule is assisted by other powerful archdevils, including {@creature Abigor|CoA}. {@creature Baalzebul|CoA} is driven towards perfecting his realm and many construction projects are constantly underway. Devils not working on the various construction projects prefer life in the domed city of Grenpoli.": "尽管对{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}不忠，{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}仍然是掌管马拉多米尼的大恶魔。他的统治得到其他强大的大恶魔的协助，包括{@creature Abigor|CoA}。{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}致力于完善他的领域，许多建设项目正在不断进行中。那些没有参与各种建设项目的恶魔更喜欢生活在穹顶城市格伦波利。",
	"The only known way in or out of Maladomini is the Styx, though rumors claim other entrances and exits exist. Because of the stream of devils entering and exiting the realm for training and schooling, scholars believe there to be a hidden infernal passageway that connects the layer to the rest of the Nine Hells. Explorers also claim that the cave system the Styx passes through has connections to other layers, though such connections have yet to be found. Besides, if one can brave the cave systems, the Styx is a relatively easy method of travel.": "马拉多米尼（Maladomini）唯一已知的进出通道是斯提克斯（the Styx），尽管有传言称存在其他入口和出口。由于源源不断的恶魔进出该领域进行训练和学习，学者们相信存在一条隐藏的地狱通道连接该层与其他九层地狱。探险家还声称，斯提克斯经过的洞穴系统与其他层有连接，尽管这样的连接尚未被发现。此外，如果有人能够勇敢地穿越洞穴系统，斯提克斯是一个相对容易的旅行方式。",
	"Although Maladomini remains one of the safer layers, the influence of the Lord of the Flies remains powerful. Whenever a creature is asked a question, they must make a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is magically compelled to tell a lie, stretch the truth, or avoid answering—anything that would prevent the truth from being told.": "尽管(Maladomini)（马拉多米尼）仍然是较为安全的层之一，但蝇王的影响仍然强大。每当有生物被问到问题时，它们必须进行一次{@dc 14}感知豁免投掷。如果未通过豁免，该生物将被魔法驱使说谎、扭曲事实或回避回答——任何可以阻止真相被揭示的行为。",
	"The characters need to make their way to the Eye Market but may want to spend some time in the other locations found in Maladomini. Use the information below to guide their excursion.": "人物需要前往眼市(Eye Market)，但也许想在马拉多米尼(Maladomini)的其他地方逗留一段时间。使用下面的信息来指导他们的行程。",
	"The characters are approached by a devil that offers them the ability to read the thoughts of someone important to them for the cost of 1 {@item Soul Coin|CoA} and 800 gp. If one of the characters is tempted, run the {@adventure appropriate temptation event|CoA|2|Betrayal} from chapter 2.": "角色们被一个恶魔接近，提供了一个能够读取他们重要人物的思绪的能力，代价是 1 {@item Soul Coin|CoA} 和 800 金币。如果其中一个角色受到诱惑，运行第 2 章中的 {@adventure appropriate temptation event|CoA|2|Betrayal}。",
	"Unique to Maladomini and known throughout the Nine Hells is Grenpoli, the City of Diplomacy. All forms of aggression or weapons are forbidden within the city, and a powerful spell suppresses violence when it would occur. Upon entering the city through one of its four gates, visitors are searched, and their weapons confiscated. These will only be returned once their visit to the city has ended. Grenpoli contains the Political College of the Nine Hells, which offers devils courses in deception, manipulation, and negotiation. Located just outside the city is Offalion, a training facility that enacts large-scale scenarios to train devils, testing and enhancing their ability to barter effectively with mortals. These exercises prepare a multitude of devils for delicate excursions into the Material Plane.": "独特于(Maladomini)并贯穿整个九层地狱的是格伦波利(Grenpoli)，即外交之城。在这座城市内，一切形式的攻击或武器都是被禁止的，一种强大的法术会在暴力事件发生时压制它。当游客通过城市的四个门进入时，会接受搜查并被没收武器。这些武器只有在他们离开城市时才会归还。格伦波利包含了九层地狱的政治学院，为恶魔提供欺骗、操纵和谈判课程。城市外有奥法利翁(Offalion)，一个训练设施，通过实施大规模场景来训练恶魔，测试并增强他们与凡人有效讨价还价的能力。这些训练准备了大量的恶魔，让他们可以进行对物质位面的细致探险。",
	"{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}'s \"greatest\" city of the moment is Gorloron, which contains his seat of power and much of the devil population in the realm. The city's construction is still underway, and the place is utter chaos.": "{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}的“至高”之城此刻是戈洛隆(Gorloron)，其中包含了他的权力中心和领域中大部分的恶魔人口。这座城市的建设仍在进行中，整个地方一片混乱。",
	"Here in the (current) capital of {@creature Baalzebul|CoA}'s realm, you can't throw a stone without hitting an architect. All are vying to gain favor from the tormented archdevil and to convince him to let them build bigger and better. One of these architects approaches the characters, explaining that his latest proposal was rejected once more. It is desperate for work and offers to build the characters a fortress or a temple in their name. The price is 3 {@item Soul Coin|CoA|Soul Coins} and 2,000 gp (a rare magic item brings the price down to 500 gp). If any of the characters take the devil up on their offer run the {@adventure appropriate temptation event|CoA|2|Oppression} from chapter 2.": "在{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}王国的现任首都，你随处可见建筑师。他们都在竞相争取那位备受折磨的大恶魔的青睐，试图说服他让他们建造更大更好的建筑。其中一位建筑师走向角色，解释说他最新的提案再次被拒绝。他急需工作，并提议为角色建造一座堡垒或寺庙以他们的名义。价格是3{@item Soul Coin|CoA|Soul Coins}和2,000 gp（一件稀有魔法物品可以将价格降至500 gp）。如果角色中有任何人接受了恶魔的提议，请运行第2章的{@adventure appropriate temptation event|CoA|2|Oppression}。",
	"Also of note is the Carnival Eternal, which is a terrifying and absurd amusement park built to reward successful devils. If the characters have not yet encountered the \"Ruin and Amusement\" random encounter ({@adventure see chapter 2|CoA|2}), feel free to run that now if the characters explore the Carnival Eternal.": "另外值得一提的是永恒狂欢节，这是一个令人恐惧且荒谬的游乐园，专门为成功的恶魔建造。如果角色们还没有遇到“毁灭与娱乐”随机事件({@adventure see chapter 2|CoA|2})，那么如果角色们探索永恒狂欢节，可以随时进行这个事件。",
	"This dangerous area is nestled in the center of a ring of partly abandoned buildings, all of it the turf of various factions vying for control.": "这个危险的区域坐落在一圈部分废弃建筑物的中心，所有这些都是各种派系争夺控制权的地盘。",
	"The Eye Market is run by an odd couple—a mind flayer and a beholder. For the right price, they will replace the eyes of a customer with new jeweled eyes of great magical power.": "眼睛市场由一对奇特的夫妇经营——一个思想吞噬者和一个眼魔。只要付出合适的价格，他们就会用具有强大魔力的新宝石眼睛替换顾客的眼睛。",
	"If asked about the Eye Market, {@creature Koh Tam|CoA} has this to say:": "如果被问及眼市场，{@creature Koh Tam|CoA}会这样说：",
	"\"Maladomini is the layer of deceit but none are more deceived perhaps than its master, {@creature Baalzebul|CoA} himself who ruins every part of it in a vain attempt to create a wonder of beauty that will put the other planes to shame. Constantly beginning and then abandoning his increasingly ambitious projects, he leaves behind a polluted waste of dead forests, toxic water, and the shells of half-completed palaces, castles and cities, each abandoned as it fails to meet its architect's impossible standards.\" He gestures at the debris of the various unfinished projects that litter the landscape.": "\"马拉多米尼是欺诈之层，但也许没有人比它的主人{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}更受骗，他毁坏了其中的每一部分，试图创造出一种美的奇迹，使其他位面感到羞愧。他不断开始然后放弃他日益雄心勃勃的项目，留下了一片被污染的废弃森林、有毒的水域，以及半建成的宫殿、城堡和城市的残骸，每一个都因未能达到建筑师不可能的标准而被抛弃。”他手势指向散布在景观中的各种未完成项目的残骸。\"",
	"\"In one particularly expansive cityscape comprised of a labyrinth of roofless houses, half-raised towers, and foundations of great works, there in the shadow of a ruined dome surely too grand ever to have been completed, squats the Eye Market, the underside of Maladomini. A festering secret hidden under the nose of the layer's archdevil, a siren's lure to all those exhausted by the hideous waste of the layer. Because there is salvation to be had there, of a kind. If the sights of Maladomini offend your eyes, the devils say, then pluck them out. My intuition tells me you should venture to the Market next.\"": "在一个特别广阔的城市景观中，由一座迷宫般的无顶房屋、半建成的塔楼和伟大工程的基础组成，在一座毁坏的圆顶的阴影下，这里就是眼市场，马拉多米尼的底层。这是一个在层主大恶魔的鼻子底下隐藏的腐烂秘密，对所有那些被这一层可怕浪费所厌倦的人来说，它是一个诱惑。因为在那里有一种救赎。如果马拉多米尼的景象冒犯了你的眼睛，恶魔们说，那就把它们拔出来。我的直觉告诉我，你应该冒险前往市场。",
	"{@creature Koh Tam|CoA} warns the characters to be careful while on the streets around the Eye Market. He can also offer the following advice:": "{@creature Koh Tam|CoA} 警告角色在（Eye Market）周围的街道上要小心。他还可以提供以下建议：",

	"Watching over the streets around the Eye Market is Akrekarn, the closest this morass has to the law. A {@creature Corruption Devil (Paeliryon)|CoA|corruption devil} ({@adventure see appendix B|CoA|14}) retired from a life of blackmailing mortals, Akrekarn patrols the streets around the market with a writ from {@creature Baalzebul|CoA}, allegedly enforcing the archdevil's will but in truth simply shaking down locals and visitors for all he can get. He is more than ready to have his mob of infernal deputies (six {@creature bearded devil||bearded devils}) seize anyone who won't bow the knee or proffer a bribe, taking them to be tormented, sold, or ransomed as he thinks best. When not terrorizing the streets, Akrekarn takes his unspeakable pleasures in the one completed building in the city, a guard house he has made his headquarters. Or else he is to be found at the Eye Market itself, shaking down the proprietors and reminding them that they operate only on sufferance.": "在眼市周围巡逻的是阿克雷卡恩，这个混乱地区最接近法律的存在。一名{@creature Corruption Devil (Paeliryon)|CoA|corruption devil} ({@adventure see appendix B|CoA|14})，曾经从事勒索凡人的生活，阿克雷卡恩携带着一纸来自{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}的文书，在市场周围 patrolling，据称是在执行大恶魔的意志，但实际上只是向当地人和游客敲诈尽可能多的钱财。他随时准备让他的六名地狱副手（{@creature bearded devil||bearded devils}）逮捕任何不肯屈服或行贿的人，将他们带走进行折磨、出售或赎回，他认为怎么做都行。当不在恐吓街道时，阿克雷卡恩会在城市中唯一一座已建成的建筑物里尽情享受他的快乐，这座警卫站已成为他的总部。否则，他会出现在眼市本身，向业主敲诈，并提醒他们他们只是在容忍之下经营。",
	"There are watchful eyes everywhere and the moment characters attack either Ilkatar, Memnoriac, or Jacelisk, Akrekarn is informed. Before the battle finishes, he arrives in an infernal airship, a gift from {@creature Baalzebul|CoA}, accompanied by his bodyguard of six bearded devils. He doesn't interfere with the battle but if the characters are victorious, he takes control of the vacated gang-leader's territory and won't permit passage until he's gotten approval from {@creature Baalzebul|CoA}. Akrekarn makes it clear that attacking him will bring on the archdevil's wrath.": "到处都有警惕的眼睛，一旦角色攻击伊尔卡塔(Ilkatar)、梅姆诺里亚克(Memnoriac)或杰塞利斯克(Jacelisk)，阿克雷卡恩(Akrekarn)就会得到通知。在战斗结束之前，他乘坐一艘来自{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}的地狱飞艇赶到，带着他的六名胡须恶魔护卫。他不会干涉战斗，但如果角色获胜，他将接管被遗弃的团伙领袖领地，并且在得到{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}的批准之前不允许通行。阿克雷卡恩明确表示，攻击他将招致大恶魔的愤怒。",

Every gang is the heart of a web of alliances and carefully negotiated territorial arrangements, all of which contain hidden get-out clauses and exceptions that allow them to be shrugged off at any moment.

	"Vaness is a {@creature beholder} of exceptional size, his pinkish hide puffed-up and corpulent. His central eye has been replaced by a lens of ruby quartz that, it is said, focuses magic rather than negating it. In his workshop, using telekinesis and extremely fine-scale disintegration, he crafts the eyes that are the Market's stock in trade. Fling, in contrast, is an {@creature alhoon|MPMM} (see Monsters of the Multiverse), a mind flayer long gone on their peculiar path to lichdom. It acts as surgeon, implanting Vaness' creations and connecting them to the brains of its patients/ customers. They make a strange and jarring pair, not least because of their manner. Vaness and Fling strike the unwary as an old married couple, constantly bantering back and forth, making jokes at one another's expense, and exploding into arguments that settle almost instantaneously. It seems impossible that either creature could actually form a real bond, but to all intents and purposes the pair seem genuinely attached. Which often serves to lull visitors into a false sense of security. Vaness and Fling have not survived the Nine Hells for so long by being nice. They're as ruthless and powerful as any other infernal magnates, able to defend themselves physically if need be, but preferring to rely on their minions, treaties with the gangs and, if necessary, protection from Akrekarn and his posse.

A simple thing, in a way, and yet priceless. Vaness' eyes allow his patients to see the layer the way it was meant to be. When a newly altered customer wakes from the surgery, the dome above them is complete, its ceiling ornate and painted with frescoes of surpassing loveliness. Vaness and Fling are elegant and dignified, the master-surgeon and the genial artificer, surrounded by their immaculate staff. Outside, the spires of the city reach towards a glorious golden sky, and beyond that there are great verdant forests, jeweled castles that would melt the heart of a Fey queen, a world of glory and wonder such as the Nine Hells have never known.": "在他们的工作室里，由Fling的精神力量奴役的{@creature grell}和{@creature grimlock||grimlocks}盲目劳动力的帮助下，Vaness和Fling移除客户的天然眼睛，并用Vaness工作室的宝石创作替换，为Maladomini提供全新的视角。在某种程度上，这是一件简单的事情，但却是无价的。Vaness的眼睛让他的患者看到了这个世界本应如何。当一个新近改变的顾客从手术中醒来时，他们头顶的圆顶完整无缺，天花板华丽而绘有超凡美丽的壁画。Vaness和Fling优雅而庄重，是大师级外科医生和和蔼的工匠，周围是他们无可挑剔的员工。在外面，城市的尖塔伸向辉煌的金色天空，再远一点是巨大的翠绿森林，宝石般的城堡会融化一位仙后的心，这是一个光辉和奇迹的世界，九层地狱从未见过。",

To live in the plane visible through Vaness' eyes is to be truly blessed.": "眼睛的真正力量在于这些事物并非幻象，对于那些能看到它们的人来说。那些塔楼可以攀登，树林结出的果实确实能够满足饥饿。与马拉多米尼(Maladomini)的有毒淤泥不同，溪流现在流淌着闪闪发光的深红色液体，尝起来像是最上等的葡萄酒，给饮者带来即刻的舒缓和清新。生活在范内斯(Vaness)眼中可见的位面中是一种真正的祝福。",

And this being the Nine Hells, they're frequently hostile. Many eye-bearers have been killed and devoured by glorious and majestic monsters that their companions can't even see, let alone fight. Moreover, everyone who leaves the Eye Market having conducted business with Vaness and Fling becomes a target. All those waiting outside would give a great deal more than their eyes to get hold of such things, even though the services of Fling would still be required to implant them. Overcome with wonder, many new patients are easy marks for muggers and back-street surgeons.": "当然，也存在一些缺点。曾经在(Maladomini)森林中漫游的古老而神奇的野兽早已灭绝，但对于那些有眼睛看到它们的人来说，它们肯定存在。在九层地狱，它们经常是敌对的。许多眼睛持有者已经被辉煌而威严的怪物杀死和吞食，而他们的同伴甚至看不到，更别说与之战斗了。此外，每个离开眼市与范尼斯(Vaness)和弗林(Fling)交易过的人都成为了目标。所有那些在外面等待的人都愿意付出比他们的眼睛更多的代价来获得这些东西，尽管弗林的服务仍然需要用来植入它们。对于这些新患者来说，被奇观所震撼，他们很容易成为抢劫犯和街头外科医生的目标。",
	"The chief question about all of this must be why {@creature Baalzebul|CoA} puts up with any of it. Vaness, Fling, and Akrekarn maintain a careful charade where the two put-upon artisans are constantly under threat from the devil, about to be turned in to the layer's archdevil unless they can come up with the latest bribe or protection instalment. And yet it never quite happens, and somehow the peculiar pair are permitted to run their business, which seems to make a mockery of everything that {@creature Baalzebul|CoA} is constantly, futilely trying to achieve in his domain.": "关于所有这些的主要问题必须是为什么{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}容忍这一切。Vaness（范尼斯）, Fling（弗林）, 和 Akrekarn（阿克雷卡恩）保持了一个小心翼翼的伪装，两位受气的工匠经常受到来自恶魔的威胁，随时可能被交给领域的大魔王，除非他们能想出最新的贿赂或保护分期付款。然而，这似乎从未发生过，而这对奇特的伙伴却被允许经营他们的生意，这似乎对{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}在他的领域中不断而徒劳地努力实现的一切都是一个讽刺。",
	"The most persuasive reason is that the eyes, for all their vaunted promise, are a curse. The wearer is at first overwhelmed by the beauty they see, delighted to walk in a 'Hell' that is suddenly restorative and pleasant. Except the truth always creeps in. Those who wear the eyes can stave off reality only so far. In their dreams they see the truth of it, the ruin and the ugliness. Day by day the understanding grows that everything they see, that they could now never live without, is only a sham, however real it is to them. The knowledge torments them, and they're driven to their own hopeless attempts to achieve a lasting perfection. In this way they share in {@creature Baalzebul|CoA}'s private misery, and perhaps that is enough reason to keep Vaness and Fling around.": "最具说服力的理由是，眼睛，尽管它们被吹捧为充满希望的象征，却是一种诅咒。戴上这些眼睛的人起初会被他们所看到的美所淹没，高兴地在一个突然变得恢复和愉快的“地狱”中行走。但真相总是悄悄逼近。戴上这些眼睛的人只能在梦中看到现实的真相，毁灭和丑陋。日复一日，他们逐渐明白，他们所看到的一切，现在他们无法再没有的东西，只是一个骗局，无论它对他们来说有多么真实。这种认识折磨着他们，驱使他们做出自己绝望的努力来实现永恒的完美。通过这种方式，他们分享了{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}的私人痛苦，也许这就足以让Vaness和Fling留在身边。",
	"A seditious whisper suggests that there is another reason. That {@creature Baalzebul|CoA}, lord of temptation, feels the hook of their services in him. The idea that he could see Maladomini as he wishes it to be, the great blueprint he constantly fails to build, eats him up constantly. So that he is constantly on the point of ordering Akrekarn to obliterate the Market, but never quite gives the order, because what if...": "一声煽动性的耳语暗示着另一个原因。那{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}，诱惑之主，感受到他们的服务在他身上的诱惑。他可以将马拉多米尼看作他希望它成为的样子，这个他不断失败的伟大蓝图，不断地折磨着他。因此，他总是在考虑命令阿克雷卡恩摧毁市场，但从未真正下令，因为如果...",

The expressions of semi-divine entities who understood, at the very last, that they had been deceived—and that they were doomed to this frozen, eternal end.": "那些到达冰川上游的人看到了巨人的面孔。这些半神实体的表情透露出他们最终明白自己被欺骗了，并且注定要被困在这冰冷永恒的尽头。",
	"The mere fact and sight of the Heights of Anakim is enough to bring mortals to their knees, but it gets worse. Whilst devils aren't averse to the idea of just leaving things to be tormented forever, they found a use for the giants. So it is that the sharp-eyed visitor scanning the upper reaches of that appalling cliff finds scaffolding and gantries and excavation. Tunnels and quarries that carve into the literal faces of the giants to get at the treasure within.": "只是看到(`Anakim之高`)的事实和景象就足以让凡人跪倒，但情况变得更糟。虽然恶魔并不反对让事物永远受折磨的想法，但他们却找到了巨人的用途。因此，那些目光敏锐的访客在那个可怕悬崖的上部发现了脚手架、走廊和挖掘设备。隧道和采石场刻进巨人的字面脸庞以获取内部的宝藏。",
	"Long after the powers of the Nine Hells had tricked the Anakim, {@creature Mephistopheles|CoA} discovered the trapped giants contained a unique resource valuable to the rest of the Nine Hells and beyond. A combination of their semidivine nature, the ancient age they were preserved from and their own vast horror at being betrayed means the minds of the giants are a source of the most concentrated misery to be found anywhere in the planes.": "在九层地狱的力量欺骗了安纳金之后，{@creature Mephistopheles|CoA} 发现被困的巨人们蕴含着一种独特的资源，对于九层地狱及其它地方都非常宝贵。这些巨人们半神的本质、被保存的古老年代以及他们自己对被背叛的巨大恐惧的结合，意味着巨人们的思想是整个位面中最集中的痛苦之源。",
	"The labyrinthine brains of the Anakim contain blue-silver seams of the stuff, that can be quarried out, rendered down, and condensed into vials and barrels of pure corrosive suffering that the devils jovially refer to as 'sorrow wine'. To mortals, the substance is pure vitriol. Concentrated, it causes wounds that strong magic can't heal, and that burn with fresh agony forever. Diluted into a potion it imposes a burden of existential unhappiness that drives the drinkers to empty hedonism and sin as their lives become hollow and meaningless. To devils, the sorrow wine is a potent beverage, a unique vintage of misery fit for the tables of {@creature Mephistopheles|CoA} and {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} themselves. In the Giant Mine, Cania's ruler has a commodity not to be found anywhere else that he uses for bribery, reward, and leverage across the lower planes. His only challenge is reliably extracting it.": "安纳基姆族的迷宫般的大脑中含有蓝银色的物质，可以被开采出来，提炼并浓缩成纯净的腐蚀性痛苦，恶魔们欢快地称之为“悲伤酒”。对凡人来说，这种物质是纯粹的尖刻。浓缩后，它造成的伤口连强大的魔法也无法治愈，永远带着新鲜的痛苦灼烧。稀释成药剂后，它会给饮用者带来存在的不幸，驱使他们沦为空洞和毫无意义的放纵和罪恶。对于恶魔来说，悲伤酒是一种强大的饮料，是一种只适合{@creature Mephistopheles|CoA}和{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}自己的独特的痛苦佳酿。在巨人矿山中，卡尼亚的统治者拥有一种其他地方找不到的商品，他用它来贿赂、奖励和在下层位面施加压力。他唯一的挑战是可靠地提取它。",
	"If sorrow wine is consumed by a creature that is not a Fiend, that creature takes 18 ({@damage 4d8}) necrotic damage. This damage can be healed only with a short or long rest.": "如果不是恶魔的生物饮用了悲伤酒，那个生物会受到18 ({@damage 4d8}) 点死灵伤害。这种伤害只能通过短休或长休来治愈。",
	"Locations relevant to this part of the adventure are described below.": "以下是与本部分冒险相关的地点描述。",
	"Ahead of you, at the base of those giant sorrowful figures, there are the tell-tale signs of settlement: a glimmer of lantern light and the shadow of smoke blown thin across the gray sky by the icy wind. As you approach, you make out the shape of buildings. A sad collection of crude huts carved from ice and arranged around the only structure that looks like it was built with any care. This building is vast and tall, and even from a distance, you hear the sounds of machinery and harried workers within.": "在你前方，在那些巨大悲伤雕像的基座上，有一些定居的明显迹象：一抹灯光的微光和被冰冷的风吹散在灰色天空中的烟影。当你走近时，你看到建筑物的轮廓。一座由冰雕刻而成的粗糙小屋的悲伤集合，围绕着唯一一座看起来用心建造的建筑物。这座建筑物巨大而高，即使在远处，你也能听到机械和匆忙工人的声音。",
	"An odd assortment of creatures use the paths leading from town to mine: carrying empty baskets on their way up and heavier loads on their way down.": "一群奇怪的生物沿着从城镇通往矿山的道路前行：上行时空着篮子，下行时携带更重的负载。",
	"At the foot (literally) of the Heights of Anakim there is a town of sorts. A huddle of buildings, mostly carved from ice, built around one vast hall raised from iron interlayered with the hides of long-extinct monsters, where the raw giant-stuff is rendered down into sorrow wine. Beyond, the cliff face itself is cut and carved with multiple zig-zagging paths up to the heights, along with winches and lifts to take miners up, and bring the yield down. In the town dwells a variety of devils seldom seen elsewhere in Cania who deal with the administration of the mining efforts, the constant infernal accountancy of supply and demand and a modicum of trading with visitors.": "在阿纳金高地（Anakim）的脚下（字面上）有一个类似城镇的地方。这里有一群建筑，大部分是由冰雕刻而成，围绕着一个巨大的大厅建造而成，大厅由铁和长已灭绝怪兽的皮革交错而成，这里将原始的巨人材料提炼成悲伤酒。在大厅之外，悬崖本身被切割和雕刻成通往高地的多条曲折路径，还有绞盘和升降机将矿工带上去，将产量带下来。在这个城镇里居住着各种在卡尼亚（Cania）其他地方很少见到的恶魔，他们负责管理采矿工作，不断进行地狱式的供需会计核算，并与访客进行一定程度的贸易。",
	"The first time the characters enter the town with {@creature Tiax|CoA} accompanying them, he hurries to the back of one of the buildings. \"{@creature Tiax|CoA} has a mighty burden to discard! I'll just be a moment.\" If the characters follow him, they catch a glimpse of {@creature Tiax|CoA} handing something to an imp that vanishes promptly. If confronted, {@creature Tiax|CoA} lies and says he was just repaying an old debt. In fact, he is preparing an ambush, to occur when the characters depart Cania. See \"{@creature Tiax|CoA}'s Betrayal\" at the end of this chapter for more details.": "第一次角色们带着{@creature Tiax|CoA}进入镇子时，他匆忙走向一座建筑物的后面。\"{@creature Tiax|CoA}有一个沉重的负担要丢弃！我只需要一会儿。\" 如果角色们跟着他，他们会看到{@creature Tiax|CoA}递东西给一个立刻消失的小恶魔。如果被质问，{@creature Tiax|CoA}会撒谎说他只是在偿还一笔旧债。事实上，他正在策划一场伏击，计划在角色们离开Cania时发生。有关更多细节，请参阅本章末尾的“{@creature Tiax|CoA}的背叛”。",
	"While most of the buildings in this town have been carved from the ice itself and squat low to the ground, as if huddling for warmth from the merciless cold, this stone and metal manor has a tall tower rising skyward. This is certainly the home of someone important.": "尽管这个小镇上的大多数建筑都是直接雕刻在冰块中，矮矮地蹲在地面上，仿佛在寒冷无情的天气中聚集取暖，但这座石头和金属建筑庄园却有一座高塔直插云霄。这肯定是某位重要人物的住所。",
	"The town itself is overseen by the gelugons—who shun such menial work—and commanded by one Baron Klendisk ({@creature ice devil} with 250 hit points), who reports directly to {@creature Mephistopheles|CoA}. The baron is an ice devil of twice the usual size, emaciated and hunched almost double, usually to be seen squatting on a spider-legged throne formed from an enslaved ice Elemental. Klendisk's public face is that of a monstrous tyrant, cruel in his discipline towards other gelugons and doubly so to any other devil breeds. Behind closed doors, he is a devil with a problem, because mining the giants and producing the sorrow wine is difficult and his own master brooks no excuses. Hence, while a terror to other devils, Klendisk is known to at least give a hearing to outsiders with a solution.": "镇上由格鲁冈（不愿从事这种琐碎工作）管理，由巴伦·克伦迪斯克（拥有250点生命值）指挥，直接向{@creature Mephistopheles|CoA}汇报。这位男爵是一名体型是寻常冰魔鬼两倍的冰魔鬼，消瘦而驼背，通常可以看到他蹲在由被奴役的冰元素形成的蜘蛛腿宝座上。克伦迪斯克的公开形象是一个怪物般的暴君，对其他格鲁冈和其他恶魔品种都残酷地施加纪律。在闭门之后，他是一个有问题的恶魔，因为挖掘巨人和生产悲伤酒是困难的，而他自己的主人不容任何借口。因此，虽然对其他恶魔是一种恐怖，克伦迪斯克被认为至少会倾听有解决方案的外来者。",
	"The difficulty is in the very nature of the stuff they mine. The raw seams of misery in the brains of the giants are powerfully destructive. Whilst Klendisk has no compunction about destroying souls or mortal prisoners, the cold of Cania and the corrosive nature of the misery destroys such tools before they can be of much use. Infernal labor has other problems. Contact with the giant-stuff makes them drunk: boisterous and leery with the heady misery of ages. A fiendish workforce would fall to squabbling, brawling and unacceptable indiscipline, even the icy gelugons themselves. It is a pitiful devil that needs to go beg outside help but that is the situation that Klendisk often finds himself in.": "挖掘的困难在于他们开采的物质的本质。巨人们大脑中的原始悲苦之缝具有强大的破坏力。虽然克伦迪斯克对毁灭灵魂或凡间囚犯毫不犹豫，但卡尼亚的寒冷和悲苦的腐蚀性质会在这些工具能发挥作用之前将其摧毁。地狱劳工还有其他问题。与巨人物质接触会让他们陶醉：兴高采烈，对岁月沉重的悲苦感到怀疑。一个邪恶的劳动力会陷入争吵、斗殴和不可接受的纪律问题，甚至连冰冷的盖鲁冈本身也无法幸免。一个可怜的恶魔需要向外求助，但这经常是克伦迪斯克发现自己处于的境地。",
	"Though these mines would seem to be a good place to avoid, mortal travelers do visit. It helps that Cania has few other locales to recommend it, and the town at the foot of the Heights does at least have shelter and goods for trade. Sometimes mortals are sent there by other Fiends, seeking to abstract some of the processed sorrow wine for their own delectation or trade. Klendisk's ice devils keep a compound eye out for strangers, though, and anyone who comes to their attention without a good excuse or permits signed in triplicate find themselves introduced to the mines or the vats in swift order, or else claimed by Klendisk for a little informal torment. Assignment to the Heights is short on entertainment.": "尽管这些矿山似乎是一个要避免的好地方，但凡间旅行者确实会造访。幸好卡尼亚没有其他很多推荐的地点，而山脚下的小镇至少有庇护所和货物可供交易。有时候，其他恶魔会派遣凡人前往那里，试图获取一些经过加工的悲伤酒以供自己享用或交易。克伦迪斯克的冰魔鬼会警惕地留意陌生人，任何未能提供充分理由或未经三次签字许可的人会很快引起他们的注意，然后被送进矿山或酒缸，或者被克伦迪斯克索取一些非正式的折磨。被分配到这个高地的人很难找到娱乐。",
	"Usually, visitors simply stay long enough to turn a profit and then leave. Others hang on too long or try to claw too much from Klendisk. When his temper breaks, he loses all perspective and has them destroyed or cast out into Cania's killing cold.": "通常，访客只停留足够长的时间来赚取利润，然后离开。其他人则挂得太久或试图从克伦迪斯克(Klendisk)抓取太多。当他发脾气时，他失去了所有的视角，让他们被摧毁或赶出到卡尼亚(Cania)的杀戮寒冷之中。",
	"Currently there are two major contractors working at the face, and one more running the rendering shed. Both mining contractors, Kargan and Cornelius, have a constant need of specialist materials—necromantic or machine components—and anyone bringing in fresh stocks will find favor with one (and attract the ire of the other). Alternatively, particularly wicked mortals with a solution to Klendisk's labor problems are always assured a hearing. The mines can always use a new contractor. For the price of 300 gp per day, Klendisk is willing to grant a dispensation to the characters so that they may attempt to work the mines.": "目前有两家主要承包商在现场工作，还有一家负责运行砌筑棚屋。两家采矿承包商，Kargan和Cornelius，对专业材料——不管是死灵还是机械零件——有持续需求，任何带来新货物的人都会得到一方的青睐（却会招致另一方的愤怒）。另外，对于有解决Klendisk劳工问题的邪恶凡人，总是能得到倾听。矿山总是需要新的承包商。以每天300 gp的价格，Klendisk愿意给予角色们特许，让他们可以尝试在矿山工作。",
	"In the Sorrow Mines most of the workforce is either Undead or made of metal. However, there are still plenty of devils roaming about, many of them are under the influence of the sorrow wine. Imbibing too much doesn't always end well for the devil in question. The prison at the edge of Klendisk's Fort houses those unfortunate devils whose liquid bravado provoked Klendisk's wrath. It is run by chain devils with several prisoners of little importance currently housed in the cells.": "在悲伤矿坑中，大部分的劳动力要么是不死族，要么是由金属构成。然而，仍然有许多恶魔在四处游荡，其中许多受到了悲伤酒的影响。对于涉及的恶魔来说，饮用过量并不总是有好结果。克伦迪斯克堡垒边缘的监狱关押着那些不幸因液体骄傲而招致克伦迪斯克的愤怒的恶魔。这里由链恶魔管理，目前有几名不太重要的囚犯被关押在牢房里。",
	"The prison is where the soul of the merciless can be found. Upon entering the village at the foot of the mines, the character searching for this soul, feels a strange pull towards this location. When the characters enter, they must evade a patrol of three {@creature chain devil||chain devils}. If they're discovered, they're attacked, and at initiative count 20 of round 5, and every 5 rounds thereafter while combat continues, another chain devil arrives to help. While being attacked in this way, the characters can't easily investigate the cells—they need to eliminate the devils and go back to hiding first.": "监狱是无情灵魂的所在之地。当角色进入矿山脚下的村庄时，寻找这个灵魂的角色会感受到对这个地点的奇怪吸引。当角色进入时，他们必须躲避三个巡逻队{@creature chain devil||chain devils}。如果他们被发现，他们会遭受攻击，在第5轮的20号先攻中，以及每隔5轮继续战斗时，会有另一个锁链恶魔到来帮忙。在这种被攻击的情况下，角色不能轻易调查牢房——他们需要先消灭恶魔，然后再回到隐藏中。",
	"Finding their way is easy, as the character in question recognizes the voices coming from one of the cells. Inside two figures are torturing a flesh golem that resembles a haggard and emaciated version of the character. The torturers look and sound exactly like the character's true love but are actually {@creature chain devil||chain devils}. If the character slays the devils without exposing their true form first, another chain devil appears in the doorway. They immediately transform into the form of the character's true love before entering the cell and attacking. During these battles the devils constantly taunt and mock the character in the voice of their loved one.": "找到他们的方法很容易，因为这个角色认出了从其中一个牢房传来的声音。在里面，两个人正在折磨一个看起来像角色的憔悴和消瘦版本的血肉傀儡。这两个折磨者看起来和听起来完全像角色真正爱的人，但实际上是{@creature chain devil||chain devils}。如果角色在暴露他们真正形态之前杀死了恶魔，另一个锁链恶魔会出现在门口。它们立即变成角色真正爱的人的形态，然后进入牢房并发动攻击。在这些战斗中，恶魔们不断用他们所爱之人的声音嘲讽和嘲笑角色。",
	"A successful {@dc 14} Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check can help the characters understand that they need to remove the devils' disguises before slaying them. They can use {@spell Dispel Magic} or any other similar means to help them break the magical disguise. Once the devils are wearing their own faces, and then slain, the flesh golem vanishes, leaving the phylactery in its place.": "一次成功的{@dc 14}智慧({@skill Insight})检定可以帮助角色们意识到在杀死恶魔之前他们需要先去除恶魔的伪装。他们可以使用{@spell Dispel Magic}或其他类似方法来帮助他们打破这种魔法伪装。一旦恶魔露出真面目被杀死后，血肉傀儡就会消失，留下魂器在原地。",
	"As the characters retreat, they must evade another patrol on their way out, as described earlier.": "当角色撤退时，他们必须避开另一支巡逻队在他们离开的路上，就像之前描述的那样。",
	"A large mass of blue-green ice, comprised primarily of sharp angles, appears to be someone's home. All the windows are frozen over and so thick as to obscure any spying from the outside. Only the massive double doors at the front appear free of such frozen constraints.": "一大块蓝绿色的冰块，主要由锐利的角构成，看起来像是某人的家。所有的窗户都冻结了，冰层如此厚，以至于遮挡了外面的窥视。只有正面的巨大双开门似乎没有被这样的冰冻约束所困扰。",
	"This is the home of the most long-standing mine baron, Kargan Skul, and even she, a frost giant, bundles herself in fur, against the uncanny cold of the plane. She spends most of her time at the mines (area T6), tending to the Undead workforce she maintains. If the characters enter her home without permission, they're attacked by Kargan's butler (archmage but their creature type is Undead), and the household staff which consists of ten ogre zombies. An {@spell Alarm} spell alerts the frost giant to the intrusion and if Kargan is encountered later in the mines, she attacks the characters without hesitation.": "这是最悠久的矿业大亨卡尔甘·斯库尔(Kargan Skul)的家园，即使是她这位冰巨人，也要裹着毛皮，抵御这个位面的刺骨寒冷。她大部分时间都在矿区(T6区)里，照料她管理的不死族劳工。如果角色未经允许进入她的家，他们将受到卡尔甘的男仆(大法师，但生物类型是不死族)以及由十个食尸鬼食尸鬼组成的家庭工作人员的攻击。一个{@spell Alarm}法术会提醒这位冰巨人有人闯入，如果稍后在矿井里遇到卡尔甘，她会毫不犹豫地攻击角色。",
	"There's a {@item Soul Coin|CoA}, 10 diamonds (each worth 1,000 gp) and 4,500 gp that can be recovered by pilfering Kargan Skul's home.": "在Kargan Skul的家中可以找到一个{@item Soul Coin|CoA}，10颗钻石（每颗价值1,000 gp）和4,500 gp。",
	"You realize that this is a home-within-a-home when you step through the ice-lodge's door and encounter wood paneling, fine (if scuffed) tile flooring, and a blazing fireplace on the far wall. Near the fire, a gnome sits in an over-sized chair that appears to have been assembled from various cogs, levers, and bits of leather. \"It's all insulated,\" he says, his voice deeper than you expected. \"Keeps the outer walls from melting. It is a simple principle, you see, one that involves thermo... well... wait... Ah. Now I see. The giant, she's finally sent you to kill me, has she?\"": "当你踏进冰屋的门，看到木板墙、精美（虽然有些磨损）的瓷砖地板和远处墙上熊熊燃烧的壁炉时，你意识到这是一个家中的家。在火堆附近，一个侏儒坐在一个看起来是由各种齿轮、杠杆和皮革碎片组装而成的超大椅子上。“这里全部都有隔热层，”他说，声音比你预想的要深。“可以防止外墙融化。这是一个简单的原理，你看，涉及到热力学...嗯...等等...啊。现在我明白了。那位巨人，她终于派你来杀我了，对吧？”",
	"Cornelius Brassgrave (neutral evil {@creature veteran}) is a gnome artificer driven from a dozen separate haunts in the mortal planes, a creature of pure reason and no morality whose industrious experiments have poisoned seas and turned the living earth into a metal-tasting wasteland. He has made a number of large claims to Klendisk about how his machinery will revolutionize the mining at the Heights and is now finding that even golems and automata can be ground down by the weight of misery. Cornelius is less suited to Cania than most of the inhabitants of this mining town, so he tends to spend most of his time here, in his very warm home. His Constructs keep him informed and alert him to any problems in production.": "Cornelius Brassgrave（中立邪恶{@creature veteran}）是一位依照当地语言习惯的侏儒工匠，被驱逐出几十个不同的凡间栖所，是一个纯粹理性而没有道德观念的生物，他勤奋的实验污染了海洋，将生命之地变成了味道像金属的荒地。他向克伦迪斯克（Klendisk）声称他的机器将彻底改变高地（the Heights）的采矿方式，但现在发现即使是魔像和自动人也会被痛苦的重压所击溃。Cornelius比这个采矿小镇的大多数居民更不适合卡尼亚（Cania），所以他倾向于在这里度过大部分时间，他的家非常温暖。他的构造体（Constructs）让他时刻保持警惕，及时通知他生产中的任何问题。",
	"Another reason that he's sticking to this haven is that Kargan Skul has been in a foul mood, believing him to be responsible for disrupting her supply lines. He isn't responsible, however, and just as confused about it as she is. If he is attacked, pieces of {@creature Animated Furniture|CoA|furniture animate} (two {@creature stone golem||stone golems} with immunity to cold and fire damage) and come to his defense. If the characters slay Kargan Skul, thus raising Cornelius' value to Baron Klendisk, or they deal with the rogue modron in the mines, Cornelius rewards each character with brass armbands, engraved with the gnome's name and family crest (each is worth 600 gp but have no special properties).": "他坚守这个避难所的另一个原因是因为卡尔甘·斯库尔一直心情糟糕，认为他是破坏她补给线的罪魁祸首。然而，他并不负责任，和她一样感到困惑。如果他受到攻击，{@creature Animated Furniture|CoA|furniture animate}（两个免疫冷冻和火焰伤害的{@creature stone golem||stone golems}）会前来保护他。如果角色们击败卡尔甘·斯库尔，从而提升了科尼利厄斯在克伦迪斯男爵心目中的价值，或者他们处理了矿井中的流氓摩德伦，科尼利厄斯会用刻有侏儒姓名和家族纹章的黄铜臂环奖励每个角色（每个价值600 gp，但没有特殊属性）。",
	"The air inside the rendering sheds is thick with the cloying scent of fermenting drink. Beneath this ugly, sour-sweet smell there hangs a heavy sense of misery, pushing down like an overbearing hand. But, somehow, the modrons that work the sheds have not collapsed beneath that weight. The short, geometrical creatures rush around, checking on machinery and inspecting vast vats of dark liquid.": "在制革棚内，空气中弥漫着发酵饮料令人作呕的气味。在这种难闻的酸甜气味之下，还有一种沉重的悲苦感，像一只压倒性的手一样向下压迫。但是，以某种方式，工作在棚内的模都（Modrons）并没有在这种重压下崩溃。这些矮小的几何生物匆忙来回奔波，检查机器并检视着巨大的黑色液体大缸。",
	"The rendering sheds themselves are run under a quite different arrangement, one that has persisted for as long as any denizens of the Heights can recall, and which Klendisk himself is powerfully uncertain about. The {@creature Regular Orthoclath|CoA} (lawful neutral {@creature iron golem} with Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom scores of 16) is a thing of facets, eyes and geometrical shapes from the lawful planes of Nirvana, here with an apparently endless workforce of modrons. They work the vats and stills tirelessly, producing sorrow wine so long as the mines yield raw materials, and never complain or ask for payment. They usually work in teams of a dozen {@creature tridrone} modrons overseen by a {@creature pentadrone} modron. {@creature Quadrone} modrons are used by the {@creature Regular Orthoclath|CoA} to send messages to teams.": "渲染棚本身是按照一种完全不同的安排运行的，这种安排已经持续了高地居民所能记忆的时间，克伦迪斯克本人对此深感不确定。{@creature Regular Orthoclath|CoA}（守序中立{@creature iron golem}，魅力、智力和感知得分为16）是一个由来自涅瓦那守序位面的多面体、眼睛和几何形状组成的存在，这里有一个似乎无穷无尽的模德龙劳动力。他们不知疲倦地操作着大缸和蒸馏器，只要矿井提供原材料，就能生产出悲伤酒，从不抱怨或要求报酬。他们通常以由一个{@creature pentadrone}模德龙监督的一打{@creature tridrone}模德龙小组的形式工作。{@creature Quadrone}模德龙被{@creature Regular Orthoclath|CoA}用来向小组发送消息。",
	"The modron's involvement predates Klendisk's appointment and the devil exhausts himself trying to discover the actual terms of their employment. In the absence of certainty, infernal rumor is that either these are, in some way, bad modrons who are being punished for crimes against lawfulness meaningless to others—or else the whole business is some grand experiment into the enduring nature of law. Certainly, individual workers eventually become corrupted by the work, sad little pieces of geometry infected with emotion, grinding to a halt as they're consumed by misery. At which point the Orthoclath casts them out, and the devils are free to devour or toy with them, not that the creatures give any real sport. There are always, apparently, more modrons ready to troop down from the lawful planes and give themselves to the work.": "在克伦迪斯 (Klendisk) 被任命之前，莫德龙的参与就已经存在了，恶魔竭尽全力试图发现他们雇佣的实际条款。在缺乏确定性的情况下，地狱传言称这些可能是以某种方式犯了违法之罪的坏莫德龙，对其他人毫无意义，或者整个事务是对法律持久性的一次伟大实验。当然，个别工作者最终会被工作腐蚀，成为被情感感染的可怜的几何形状，随着被悲伤吞噬而停滞不前。在这一点上，欧索克拉斯 (Orthoclath) 将它们驱逐出去，恶魔们可以自由地吞食或戏耍它们，尽管这些生物并不提供任何真正的娱乐。显然，总是有更多的莫德龙准备从法定位面涌入并投身于工作。",
	"Once the characters reach the mine entrance at the top of the glacier, read the following:": "一旦角色们到达冰川顶部的矿井入口，阅读以下内容：",
	"You notice the eyes first. Each of them is enormous, in proportion to the colossal faces they're set in. Most are blown wide in horror, in pure, undisguised terror. These eyes rest above faces full of pain, with mouths drawn tight in grief or frozen open, midscream. But more haunting than the eyes of fear and rage are the eyes that contain nothing at all. No emotion. Just dull acceptance. There are shapes just above the eyes of some of these giants. As you draw closer, you think they might be caves and then you see the workers that scramble in and out of them and you realize that they're tunnels. Mines. Dug straight through the frozen heads of the dead.": "你首先注意到的是眼睛。每只眼睛都巨大无比，与它们所在的庞大脸庞相比。大多数眼睛都因恐惧而瞪大，流露出纯粹、毫无掩饰的恐怖。这些眼睛盯着充满痛苦的脸庞，嘴巴紧闭或者张得大大的，仿佛在尖叫。但比恐惧和愤怒之眼更加令人不安的是那些什么也没有的眼睛。没有情感，只有麻木的接受。有些巨人的眼睛上方有形状。当你走近一看，你会觉得它们可能是洞穴，然后你看到工人们在里面进进出出，你意识到那是隧道。矿洞。直接挖穿了死者的冰冻头颅。",
	"There are more treasures than mere misery frozen in the glacier. The giants were artisans to the gods before they rebelled. They clutch in their colossal frozen arms treasures from elder ages, secrets on great withered scrolls, the raw stuff of creation stolen from divine workshops. An intrepid team of mortals might steal up the cliffs and into the mines where untold treasures wait to be unearthed deep in the heart of the ice. Even the spoil-heaps of the mines themselves glitter with discarded wonders, if only one can get to them. For while the devils care only for the misery and the wine they make from it, punishing errant thieves remains one of their few pleasures and they always look forward to the next visitors—mortals or devils—to try it.": "冰川中不仅仅是悲苦，还藏着更多的宝藏。巨人们在背叛之前曾是众神的工匠。他们在巨大的冰冻手臂中抓住了来自上古时代的宝藏，伟大枯萎卷轴上的秘密，从神圣工坊偷来的创世原料。一支无畏的凡人团队或许可以攀登悬崖，进入矿井，那里埋藏着无数宝藏，深藏在冰川之心。甚至矿井的废料堆本身也闪烁着被抛弃的奇迹，只要有人能够接近。因为恶魔们只关心悲苦和从中酿造的葡萄酒，惩罚违规的窃贼始终是他们少数的乐趣之一，他们总是期待着下一批访客——无论是凡人还是恶魔——来尝试。",
	"The items of value these giants crafted aren't easily transported. If an entire day is spent excavating, the characters recover a 100-pound statue made of gold and gems (and worth {@dice d12 x 500} gp). However, this excavation draws the attention–and wrath–of the devils unless the baron has granted the characters a dispensation. A similar statue can be recovered with each day's effort, until {@dice 3d4} have been unearthed.": "这些巨人制作的有价值的物品不容易运输。如果整整一天都花在挖掘上，角色们会找到一座价值{@dice d12 x 500} gp 的由黄金和宝石制成的重100磅的雕像。然而，这次挖掘会引起恶魔的注意和愤怒，除非男爵给予角色们特许。每天的努力可以找到类似的雕像，直到挖出{@dice 3d4}座为止。",
	"While in the Sorrow Mine, any creature that isn't a Fiend that fails a saving throw, now has disadvantage on all saving throws, including death saving throws, until they leave the Sorrow Mine and finish a long rest.": "在悲伤矿井(Sorrow Mine)中，任何不是恶魔的生物如果未能通过豁免检定，现在在离开悲伤矿井(Sorrow Mine)并完成一次长休之前，都将在所有豁免检定上获得劣势，包括生死豁免检定。",
	"Most of the workers in the mines are either automatons, under the control of Cornelius Brassgrave, or the Undead created by Kargan Skul (lawful evil, Huge-sized {@creature lich} but she isn't Undead, her creature type is Giant). Cornelius is at his home in the town below, but Kargan is almost always in the mine. She is a necromancer of considerable power and her solution to efficiently mining has been to use mindless Undead to do the brute work. She is constantly importing bones and cadavers from elsewhere in the planes, preferring to create ogre zombies and minotaur skeletons for the mining operation. The misery erodes even these, but so long as she can get the raw material, she can keep up productivity.": "矿山中的大多数工人要么是自动机器人，受到康尼利厄斯·布拉斯格雷夫的控制，要么是由卡尔甘·斯库尔（守序邪恶，巨大型{@creature lich}但她不是不死族，她的生物类型是巨人）创造的不死族。康尼利厄斯在下面的城镇里的家中，但卡尔甘几乎总是在矿山里。她是一位实力非凡的死灵法师，她解决高效采矿的方法是利用无意识的不死族来做粗活。她不断地从其他位面进口骨骼和尸体，更喜欢为采矿作业创造食人魔僵尸和牛头怪骷髅。这种悲惨情况甚至侵蚀了这些不死族，但只要她能获得原材料，她就能保持生产力。",
	"Kargan Skul wields the {@item Staff of the Magi} (40 charges), carries it with her everywhere, and is quick to use it if threatened. She will generally not relinquish the staff without a fight. However, if the characters deal with the rogue modron sabotaging her Undead workers, she is willing to sell the staff to them, for the sum of 10,000 gp.": "Kargan Skul挥舞着{@item Staff of the Magi} (40 charges)，她随身携带这个法杖，并且一旦受到威胁就会迅速使用它。她通常不会轻易放弃这根法杖。然而，如果角色们处理了破坏她不死族工人的流氓模德隆，她愿意以1万金币的价格将法杖卖给他们。",
	"There is a steady stream of Constructs and Undead, harvesting the raw material of sorrow wine, and carrying it to the mining town below. The two factions seem to ignore—or not even notice—one another. However, Kargan's workforce has deteriorated faster than usual, with fewer of her zombie and skeletons making the return trek to town. She has attracted Klendisk's ire by falling behind, and believes that her chief competitor Cornelius is sabotaging her supply lines.": "有一股源源不断的构造体和不死族，正在收割悲伤酒的原材料，并将其运送到下面的采矿小镇。这两个派系似乎互不理会，甚至根本没有注意到彼此。然而，卡尔甘的劳动力比平时下降得更快，她的僵尸和骷髅回城的数量也减少了。她因为落后而招致了克伦迪斯的愤怒，并相信她的主要竞争对手科尼利厄斯正在破坏她的供应线。",
	"Only if the characters are investigating Kargan Skul's claims of sabotage, do they discover the truth. A lowly modron (chaotic neutral {@creature quadrone} with 50 hit points) has been corrupted by the overwhelming grief permeating the mines. It has gone rogue and skulks the shadows of the mines, pushing miners off scaffolding, or narrow rock bridges when it can. Unfortunately, the Undead tend to be easier to shove than the golems, so many more of Kargan's minions have been lost to the mines, than Cornelius' golems.": "只有当角色们调查卡尔甘·斯库尔关于破坏的指控时，他们才会发现真相。 一个卑微的模德机（混乱中立 {@creature quadrone}，拥有50点生命值）已经被充斥矿井的压倒性悲伤所腐化。 它已经变得狂暴，并潜伏在矿井的阴影中，尽可能地将矿工推下脚手架或狭窄的岩石桥。 不幸的是，不死者往往比魔像更容易推开，所以卡尔甘的手下中有更多人丧生于矿井，而不是科尼利厄斯的魔像。",
	"After an hour of investigation, the characters come upon the following:": "经过一个小时的调查，角色们发现了以下情况：",
	"There's a loud swoosh and you see a strange, blockish figure with wings fly out from the shadows and slam into an iron golem carrying a large satchel of ore. The golem doesn't even register the attack, and continues marching forward, while the winged creature shakes its head a moment before flapping its wings and flying back into the shadows.": "有一声巨大的嗖声，你看到一个奇怪的、方块状的带着翅膀的身影从阴影中飞出，猛地撞向一个提着一大袋矿石的铁傀儡。那个傀儡甚至没有察觉到这次袭击，继续向前行进，而那个有翅膀的生物摇了摇头，然后扇动翅膀飞回到阴影中。",
	"If the characters pursue the modron, it tries to stay in the air 60-80 feet away from them and fires arrows. It can't be reasoned with. If it is badly damaged, it charges the weakest looking character and tries to grapple them. If successful, it uses its movement to jump into the abyss of the mine with its victim (maximum fall damage).": "如果角色们追击莫德龙，它会试图保持在离他们60-80英尺的空中，并射箭。它无法与之交谈。如果它受到严重伤害，它会冲向看起来最虚弱的角色并试图将其抓住。如果成功，它会利用自己的移动力跳入矿井的深渊，带着受害者一起（最大坠落伤害）。",
	"The characters can use this information as they see fit—if either Kargan or Cornelius learn of the rogue modron, hostility between their two factions decreases a bit. Klendisk, if told, won't reveal the truth to Kargan. He, of course, is more than happy to have Brassgrave and Kargan constantly sniping at each other. He has no interest in his underlings uniting and ending up in a position where they could make demands of him.": "角色们可以根据自己的需要使用这些信息——如果Kargan或Cornelius中的任何一位得知这个流氓模德龙的事情，他们两个派系之间的敌意会稍微减少一些。如果告诉Klendisk，他不会向Kargan透露真相。他当然很乐意看到Brassgrave和Kargan不断地互相攻击。他对于自己的部下团结起来并最终处于可能向他提出要求的位置没有兴趣。",
	"If the modron's body is returned to the {@creature Regular Orthoclath|CoA} (area T5), it is taken away to be repurposed.": "如果模德龙的身体被送回到{@creature Regular Orthoclath|CoA}（T5区域），它将被带走重新利用。",
	"A character looking for the phylactery of the student, notices a gnome that is dashing between the feet of the zombie workers. The gnome is holding a bucket above her head. In truth the gnome is a shell that is used to torture the student. The soul is linked to the body of a long-deceased female gnome and has been imprisoned here in the mines, enduring the agonizing pain and despair that comes from contact with the sorrow. The student is driven to work harder and harder by the brutish overseers.": "一个角色正在寻找（the student）的魂器，注意到一个侏儒正在在僵尸工人的脚下穿梭。这个侏儒举着一个桶放在头顶上。事实上，这个侏儒是一个外壳，用来折磨（the student）。这个灵魂与一个早已逝去的女侏儒的身体联系在一起，被囚禁在这座矿山中，忍受着与悲伤接触带来的极度痛苦和绝望。（the student）被粗暴的监工逼得越来越努力地工作。",
	"A gnome sprints past you carrying, over her head, a bucket filled to the edges, the sorrow sloshing out of it as she runs. As it hits her face and hands, she lets out an agonizing wail. Fresh wounds appear where the oozing liquid touches her skin. Her knees buckle underneath her, and she falls to the floor sobbing. An overseer stomps over and starts chastising the gnome, forcing her to crawl back up. With a despondent sigh, she picks up the now empty bucket and turns back to fill the bucket anew.": "一名侏儒从你身边飞奔而过，头顶上方举着一个桶，桶里装满了边缘的悲伤，随着她奔跑时溅出来。当液体溅到她的脸和手上时，她发出一声痛苦的哀号。液体触及她的皮肤时，新伤口就会出现。她的膝盖在她身下弯曲，她跪倒在地板上哭泣。一名监工跺着脚走过来开始责备这名侏儒，逼着她爬起来。她叹了口气，捡起现在空空如也的桶，然后转身回去重新装满桶。",
	"If the characters follow the gnome into the workshop, they are attacked by four ogre zombies. Once three of the brutes have died, Kargan joins the fight to defend her workforce. After Kargan is defeated the body of the imp collapses lifeless on the floor, dissolving and leaving the phylactery in its place. Once the character takes possession of the phylactery of the student, they gain the Phylactery Benefit associated with it.": "如果角色跟随侏儒进入车间，他们会遭遇四个食人魔僵尸。当三个蛮子死后，卡尔甘加入战斗保护她的员工。在卡尔甘被打败后，小恶魔的身体无生命地倒在地板上，溶解并留下魂器。一旦角色拿到学生的魂器，他们会获得与之相关的魂器效益。",
	"When the characters are ready to meet with their group patron after completing all of the required objectives, they may ask {@creature Koh Tam|CoA} to sail them to the agreed upon location in Cania. This location should probably be close to the Lake of Wael to encourage the characters to travel there after this meeting.": "当角色完成所有必要的任务后，准备与他们的团队赞助人见面时，他们可以请求{@creature Koh Tam|CoA}将他们带到在卡尼亚约定的地点。这个地点可能应该靠近韦尔湖，以鼓励角色在会面后前往那里旅行。",
	"Sailing through the icy Styx is a ponderous affair, as the vessel glides past erratic ice floes and evades larger icebergs that seem to rise from the waters with disheartening frequency. Eventually the barge slides down yet another ice-crusted tributary and crests a bend in the waters. A pavilion-style tent waits along the shore, several feet back of the waters. A banner rises above the tent, apparently frozen in mid-motion despite these gusting winds of Cania.": "穿越冰冷的冥河是一件沉重的事情，船只在不规则的浮冰旁滑行，躲避似乎频繁地从水中升起的更大冰山。最终，渡船再次滑过另一条结满冰层的支流，到达水域的一个拐角。一座亭子式的帐篷伫立在岸边，离水面几英尺远。一面旗帜在帐篷上方飘扬，尽管坎尼亚的狂风肆虐，但似乎被冻结在半空中。",
	"The banner is a deep red with electrum-colored striping if the group patron is the Conclave of Halruaa. If the characters allied instead with the Deathstalkers, the banner is a velvety black, speckled with white frost. The Hellrider's banner is a bright silver, on it their coat of arms is depicted in radiant gold.": "如果团队的赞助者是哈鲁亚议会，横幅是深红色的，带有电银色条纹。如果角色们与死亡潜行者结盟，横幅是丝绒般的黑色，上面点缀着白色霜。地狱骑士的旗帜是明亮的银色，上面用辉煌的金色描绘了他们的家徽。",

	"The rattle of armor alerts you to a warrior's presence beyond the tent, but before you're able to enter, {@creature Sarevok|CoA} himself strides from the interior to confront you on the snowy shoreline of Cania.

Exactly how it came to the Nine Hells in the first place is lost to time—brought by some infernal collector or slipping through a temporary portal between planes. It found its way to the Styx, losing all recollection of its own past and nature but not simply dissipating.

Though, in this case, 'lesser' can still mean very powerful indeed. Adramalech and Morax have served the greatest of Fiends faithfully since the earliest days of the Nine Hells. They were angels within the host {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} commanded. When he fell, they cast themselves willingly down to be with him. In an internal hierarchy rife with ambition and betrayal, the brothers' lawful nature manifests as absolute loyalty. In return, {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} gives them what they want. They stand outside the intricate hierarchies of the Nine Hells, reporting directly to him and undertaking his commands with their own hands, his personal enforcers. His 'hounds', say other devils with a sneer of contempt, but Adramalech and Morax are as content with their lot as any devil can be.": "{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}在激怒时很少亲自挥鞭。他有次等恶魔为他效劳。然而，在这种情况下，“次等”仍然可能意味着非常强大。自九层地狱的早期起，阿德拉马勒克(Adramalech)和莫拉克(Morax)就忠实地侍奉着最伟大的恶魔。他们曾是{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}指挥下的天使。当他堕落时，他们自愿投身其中。在一个充满野心和背叛的内部等级制度中，这对兄弟的守法本性表现为绝对的忠诚。作为回报，{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}给予他们他们想要的。他们站在九层地狱错综复杂的等级制度之外，直接向他报告，并亲手执行他的命令，成为他的私人执法者。其他恶魔用轻蔑的口吻称他们为“猎犬”，但阿德拉马勒克和莫拉克对自己的处境感到满足，就像任何恶魔一样。",
	"They manifest most often as chalky white humanoids, Adramalech around eight feet tall and the hulking Morax, twelve. Morax is the more physically potent of the two, his hide spined and barbed, his hands jagged talons. Adramalech does most of the talking, to dreadful effect. As befits {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s devils-of-all-work, they're a versatile pair of monsters, more than equipped to punish those who have disappointed their master. And 'punish' is the operative term. {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} dispatches his enemies to them when they've roused his personal ire.": "它们通常表现为粉笔般的白色人形生物，阿德拉马勒克（Adramalech）身高约八英尺，而庞大的莫拉克（Morax）则有十二英尺高。莫拉克是两者中更具身体力量的，他的皮肤长满了刺和倒钩，手上是锯齿状的利爪。阿德拉马勒克则大多数时候负责讲话，效果可怕。作为{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}的万能恶魔，它们是一对多才多艺的怪物，足以惩罚那些让他们的主人失望的人。而“惩罚”正是关键词。当{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}对敌人感到愤怒时，他会把他们送交给这两个怪物。",
	"{@creature Brother Morax|CoA|Morax} (see the accompanying stat block) has the tremendous strength and speed one would expect of a martial devil. His spines are brittle and hollow, and shards of them lodge in the flesh of those he strikes, or who strike him, where they rapidly begin to grow jagged extrusions of their own like miniature sea urchins. The shards must be cut out swiftly before they carve his victims up from the inside.

	"Adramalech retains his angelic voice from before the fall. His golden words inveigle their way into the ears of listeners, confusing, distracting, distorting the way they see the world and causing mind-wrenching dissonance in mortal minds. Worse than this, Adramalech can conjure simulacra of his enemies' loved ones, living or dead. More than mere illusions, these creations have a temporary life and thought drawn from the memories of the brothers' enemies. This psychic link means that, when Adramalech torments them or Morax tears them apart, the pain is felt by those whose minds gave rise to them. In this way, {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s decreed punishments combine physical agony and mental trauma in equal measure.": "阿德拉马勒克（Adramalech）保留了他堕落之前的天使般嗓音。他那金色的言辞巧妙地钻入听众的耳朵，混淆、分散、扭曲他们看待世界的方式，在凡人心灵中引起脑海剧痛的不和谐感。更糟糕的是，阿德拉马勒克能召唤他的敌人所爱的人的模拟体，无论是活着还是已故。这些创造物不仅仅是幻象，它们拥有暂时的生命和思想，来源于兄弟敌人的记忆。这种心灵联系意味着，当阿德拉马勒克折磨它们或者莫拉克（Morax）撕裂它们时，痛苦也会被那些心灵孕育它们的人所感受。这样，{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}所颁布的惩罚将身体的痛苦和心灵创伤等量结合在一起。",

	"The long hallway of the bridge is eerily silent. You hear the steady rush of water outside the submersible as the vessel cuts through the river, but inside it is still and dark. The brightest light comes from the words writ in fire on the walls, that flash briefly and then vanish. A long metal device hangs from the ceiling in the center of the room, with handles on the sides and small windows for the eyes.": "桥梁的长廊异常安静。当潜水艇穿过河流时，你听到外面水流的稳定声音，但里面一片寂静和黑暗。最明亮的光来自墙上用火焰写的字，它们会短暂地闪烁然后消失。在房间中央的天花板上悬挂着一个长长的金属装置，两侧有把手，眼睛的位置有小窗户。",

	"This small room appears to usually be used for storage, but manacles have been bolted to the wall and a tiefling sits in a comfy chair beside them. There's a plate of food in his lap and a half full bottle of wine beside the chair. A small satchel sits under the chair. As he hears you enter, he looks up, licks his fingers, and smiles. \"More guests of our superb host, {@creature Abigor|CoA}? I'll wager a soul coin, that you are here to rescue me.\"": "这个小房间看起来通常用于储物，但是手铐已经被螺栓固定在墙上，一个座椅旁边坐着一个鬼族，他身旁有一盘食物和一瓶半满的酒。一个小袋子放在椅子下面。当他听到你进来时，他抬起头，舔了舔手指，微笑着说道：“我们出色的主人又迎来了新客人，{@creature Abigor|CoA}？我打赌一枚灵魂币，你是来救我的。”",
	"The prisoner is named {@creature Aeshma|CoA} (see his entry in {@adventure appendix C|CoA|15}).

To fulfill their patron's objective, the characters must capture and destroy {@creature Aeshma|CoA}'s soul. {@creature Aeshma|CoA} knows nothing of this: as far as he is concerned, he's just a fairly lucky (albeit compulsive) gambler making his way through life. Despite his ignorance, {@creature Aeshma|CoA}, and the protection being the Unmaker provides, isn't going to make this grim task easy for the characters. The following describes what the characters might learn from {@creature Aeshma|CoA}, or how he might react depending on how they interact with him:": "如果角色为议会工作，{@creature Aeshma|CoA} 就是毁灭者。为了完成他们的主人的目标，角色必须捕获并摧毁{@creature Aeshma|CoA}的灵魂。{@creature Aeshma|CoA} 对此一无所知：在他看来，他只是一个相当幸运（尽管有强迫症）的赌徒在人生中前进。尽管他对此一无所知，{@creature Aeshma|CoA}，以及作为毁灭者提供的保护，不会让角色轻松完成这个严峻的任务。以下描述了角色可能从{@creature Aeshma|CoA}那里学到的东西，或者根据他们与他的互动方式他可能会如何反应：",
	"If asked why he's not chained up, he merely shrugs and says he made a bet with the guards and he won. He'll raise the plate of food and declare, \"That's how I got this as well.\" However, if the characters appear to be dangerous to him, he lies instead and insists that there was another prisoner here, \"A really bad fellow; they just dragged him off, that-away.\" If they leave, he attempts to hide from them in the submersible.": "如果有人问他为什么没有被锁起来，他只是耸耸肩，说他和卫兵打赌，他赢了。他会举起盘子里的食物，宣称：“这也是我得到的方式。”然而，如果人物对他显得危险，他会撒谎，坚称这里曾经有另一个囚犯，“一个真正坏蛋；他们刚刚把他拖走了，那边。”如果他们离开，他会试图在潜水艇里躲藏起来。",
	"If asked about being the Unmaker, {@creature Aeshma|CoA} (truthfully) has no idea what the characters are talking about. The reality is that {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}—and perhaps other archdevils—would like to use the Unmaker to set the stage for a wager of divine proportions, one that will leave the world permanently changed and possibly irrevocably broken. Though {@creature Aeshma|CoA} himself is innocent in this future wrongdoing, his soul is simply too dangerous to be allowed to exist.": "如果被问及是否是“毁灭者”，{@creature Aeshma|CoA}（如实地）完全不知道人物在谈论什么。事实是，{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}——也许还有其他大恶魔——想要利用“毁灭者”来为一场神圣级别的赌局铺平道路，这场赌局将永久改变世界，可能会使其无法挽回地破碎。尽管{@creature Aeshma|CoA}本人在这未来的罪行中是无辜的，但他的灵魂实在是太危险，不能允许其继续存在。",
	"{@creature Aeshma|CoA} tries to talk his way out of conflict, and if that fails, he flees. If slain, the characters have 1 minute to use the Conclave Coin to capture {@creature Aeshma|CoA}'s soul, otherwise the Unmaker is reborn in the next generation and the threat returns (the characters fail their patron, who no longer provides additional support, other than {@creature Koh Tam|CoA}'s services).": "{@creature Aeshma|CoA}试图通过交谈化解冲突，如果失败，他会逃跑。如果被杀，角色们有1分钟时间使用议会硬币来捕捉{@creature Aeshma|CoA}的灵魂，否则毁灭者将在下一代中重生，威胁将再次出现（角色们失败了他们的主保护者，除了{@creature Koh Tam|CoA}的服务外，不再提供额外支持）。",
	"Ultimately the characters must slay {@creature Aeshma|CoA} and capture his soul with the Conclave Coin. Once accomplished, they can bring the coin with them to their final meeting with their patrons (see \"{@adventure A Thankful Patron|CoA|10|A Thankful Patron}\" in chapter 10). Clever characters might instead destroy the coin now, ensuring that the soul doesn't fall into the wrong hands. An infernal ship's furnace consumes the Conclave Coin instantly and destroys the coin in the process. The soul trapped in the coin becomes trapped in the furnace instead, powering the infernal ship. Not even divine intervention can restore a soul destroyed in this manner.": "最终角色们必须击败{@creature Aeshma|CoA}并用议会硬币捕获他的灵魂。一旦完成，他们可以携带硬币与他们的赞助人进行最后的会面(见第10章中的\"{@adventure A Thankful Patron|CoA|10|A Thankful Patron}\")。聪明的角色们也许会选择立刻摧毁硬币，确保灵魂不会落入错误的手中。地狱船的熔炉会立刻吞噬议会硬币并在过程中摧毁硬币。被困在硬币中的灵魂会被困在熔炉中，为地狱船提供动力。即使是神圣干预也无法恢复以这种方式摧毁的灵魂。",
	"There is an immense tank filled with water in the center of the room. A grotesque creature with countless tentacles swims in it. The creature uses its many limbs to touch the infernal sigils carved into the wide wall in front of it with careful intention, leaving streaks of slime in its wake.": "房间中央有一个装满水的巨大水槽。一个长着无数触手的怪物在其中游动。这个怪物用它众多的肢体小心地触摸着面前宽阔墙壁上雕刻的地狱符文，留下一道道黏液痕迹。",
	"The tentacled creature is an {@creature aboleth} that was imprisoned by {@creature Abigor|CoA} centuries ago. It now serves the purpose of keeping {@creature Abigor|CoA} in communication with everyone on the ship and its other servants throughout the Nine Hells. The aboleth uses the sigils to send messages to other rooms in the submersible or receive messages from those locations. Likewise, and not unlike a {@item Sending Stones||Sending Stone}, some of {@creature Abigor|CoA}'s minions carry talismans that can send messages to this room or receive messages from it, even when they are on a different layer.": "这个长着触手的生物是一个{@creature aboleth},几个世纪前被{@creature Abigor|CoA}囚禁起来。它现在的作用是让{@creature Abigor|CoA}与船上所有人以及九层地狱中的其他仆人保持沟通。邪贝利用这些符文来发送信息到潜艇的其他房间，或者接收来自那些地点的信息。同样地，就像一个{@item Sending Stones||Sending Stone}一样，{@creature Abigor|CoA}的一些仆从携带着可以发送信息到这个房间或者从这个房间接收信息的护身符，即使他们在不同的层面上。",
	"The aboleth knows many things and it is willing to share for the right price. A rare or more powerful magic item is what it wants in exchange for knowledge.

	"{@creature Asmodeus|CoA} arose from the primordial chaos as the mightiest of the lawful gods, with Jazirian the only one who could rival him.

His body fell through the multiverse until it crashed into Nessus forming the canyon known as the Serpent's Coil.": "{@creature Asmodeus|CoA} 从混沌初现，作为最强大的秩序神之一，只有贾兹里安(Jazirian)能与他匹敌。他们两个都化身为巨蛇，决心将秩序带给混沌。最终，这两位神祗交战，{@creature Asmodeus|CoA} 被打败。他的身体穿越多元宇宙，最终坠落到涅瑟斯(Nessus)，形成了被称为蛇环峡谷的地方。",
	"{@creature Asmodeus|CoA} is a fallen angel. He was originally tasked with keeping the demons of the Abyss in check, but eventually to become better at killing demons he and his angelic followers took on demonic traits. This led to him being banished by the gods. But before he was exiled to the Nine Hells, he was able to fool the gods into signing the Pact Primeval. This is a contract between {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} and the gods of the multiverse that allows {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} and his servants to legally corrupt mortal souls so that they end up in the Nine Hells. These souls can then be used to increase {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s power.": "{@creature Asmodeus|CoA} 是一位堕落天使。他最初的任务是控制深渊中的恶魔，但为了更有效地杀死恶魔，他和他的天使追随者们逐渐带上了恶魔的特征。这导致他被众神放逐。但在被流放到九层地狱之前，他成功欺骗众神签署了原始契约。这是{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}和多元宇宙的众神之间的合同，允许{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}和他的仆人们合法地腐化凡人的灵魂，使它们最终进入九层地狱。这些灵魂可以用来增加{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}的力量。",
	"{@creature Asmodeus|CoA} served the first and most powerful god, He Who Was. {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} chaffed at having a master, so he used an artifact called the Shard of Evil to kill his god.

	"{@creature Abigor|CoA} is {@creature Baalzebul|CoA}'s chief general, a warlike monster fit for the violence that the Lord of Deceit considers beneath him. Its preferred shape is a flayed-looking humanoid with musculature of polished metal. Physically, {@creature Abigor|CoA} commands tremendous strength and destructive power. Its greatest joy, however, is to command a battlefield, ordering legions of infernal troops in complex stratagems against the enemies of the Nine Hells. In times past, {@creature Abigor|CoA} has commanded the legions of Maladomini up in Avernus to stem the tides of the Abyss. Most of the time, though, {@creature Baalzebul|CoA} keeps the monstrous creature close to guard against domestic threats or punish those underlings whose construction efforts disappoint their master, as they inevitably do. {@creature Abigor|CoA} considers its talents wasted in such sideshows and its frustrated dreams of war manifest in counterproductive ways. Visitors sneaking through Maladomini might be surprised to find legions of devils standing about in parade ground order, or else marching and drilling, every maneuver perfect, yet their general is never satisfied. What the perfect city is to {@creature Baalzebul|CoA}, military exercises are to {@creature Abigor|CoA}. The archdevil forces its troops to march and salute and trudge through ever more complex motions as it plays at war. Alternatively, it throws its soldiers into vast war games across the ruinous country of Maladomini, decimating its own troops just to try out some new stratagem. {@creature Abigor|CoA} is rightfully hated by all the devils under its command, and covertly mocked by its peers for its obsessions.": "{@creature Abigor|CoA}是{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}的总大将，一个适合暴力的战斗怪物，这种暴力被欺诈之主认为是低贱的。它偏好的形态是一个看起来像被剥皮的人形，肌肉像抛光的金属。在身体上，{@creature Abigor|CoA}拥有巨大的力量和破坏力。然而，它最大的乐趣是指挥战场，指挥地狱军队执行复杂的战略对抗九层地狱的敌人。在过去，{@creature Abigor|CoA}曾指挥驻扎在阿弗努斯的马拉多米尼军团，以阻止深渊的潮流。然而，大部分时间，{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}让这个怪物般的生物近身保护，以防范国内威胁或惩罚那些让主人失望的下属，而这些情况必然会发生。{@creature Abigor|CoA}认为自己的才能在这些闹剧中被浪费，它对战争的沮丧梦想以逆向的方式显现。潜入马拉多米尼的访客可能会惊讶地发现恶魔军团整齐地站在操场上，或者在进行游行和操练，每一个动作都完美无缺，然而他们的将军从未感到满足。对{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}来说，完美的城市是什么，对{@creature Abigor|CoA}来说，军事演习就是什么。这位大恶魔强迫它的部队进行行军、敬礼和进行越来越复杂的动作，仿佛在进行战争游戏。或者，它将士兵投入到马拉多米尼的废墟之地进行大规模的战争游戏，为了尝试一些新的战略而消灭自己的部队。{@creature Abigor|CoA}被它指挥的所有恶魔们正当地憎恶，被同行们暗中嘲笑它的执念。",
	"Getting close to {@creature Abigor|CoA} without engaging legions of infernal troops is difficult—to {@creature Abigor|CoA}'s regret, in fact. Sometimes the archdevil decides to test Maladomini's security by creating openings for imaginary assassins and spies, to see who might take advantage of them. On one occasion this resulted in a determined paladin getting far too close to {@creature Baalzebul|CoA} himself, for which {@creature Abigor|CoA} spent some decades being whipped by infernal rust monsters. After that incident, {@creature Abigor|CoA} became obsessed with presenting a clean and martial appearance, employing a small legion of imps to burnish its skin to a blazing shine.": "在不引起地狱军队的注意的情况下接近{@creature Abigor|CoA}是困难的——这让{@creature Abigor|CoA}感到遗憾。有时，这位大恶魔会决定通过制造虚构的刺客和间谍来测试马拉多米尼的安全性，以查看谁会利用这些漏洞。一次，这导致一位坚定的圣骑士离{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}本尊太近，结果是{@creature Abigor|CoA}被地狱锈蚀怪鞭笞了几十年。在那次事件之后，{@creature Abigor|CoA}变得痴迷于展现干净和军事化的外表，雇佣了一小队小恶魔来擦亮它的皮肤，使其闪闪发光。",
	"An actual physical run-in with {@creature Abigor|CoA} (see the accompanying stat block) should be a simple, brutal experience but its relative isolation at the heart of Maladomini has left it curiously desperate to make the most of any fight it might get into. Rather than simply tear up the opposition, it constantly changes to more and more complex and convoluted tactics, desperate to make the very most of any melee. In doing so, it can end up missing obvious opportunities to destroy its enemies, or even inadvertently give them an advantage or let them escape. In one recorded instance, the archdevil even broke off the fight at its moment of victory to school its enemies in how they could provide a greater challenge, then insisted on beginning the fight anew.": "与 {@creature Abigor|CoA}（见附带的属性块）实际发生的肉体冲突应该是一个简单而残酷的经历，但它在马拉多米尼的中心相对孤立，让它变得异常渴望在任何战斗中充分利用。它不只是简单地撕裂对手，而是不断转变为更加复杂和曲折的战术，渴望充分利用任何近战。在这样做的过程中，它可能会错过摧毁敌人的明显机会，甚至无意中给予他们优势或让他们逃脱。在一次记录中，这位大恶魔甚至在取得胜利的时刻中断了战斗，教导敌人如何提供更大的挑战，然后坚持重新开始战斗。",
	"If the characters have come to slay {@creature Abigor|CoA} for the hag, {@creature Anacreda|CoA}, when the archdevil is defeated, they feel the ever-pressing weight of the geas that has bound them magically lift.

	"The characters don't need to keep {@creature Abigor|CoA} alive for the Triad's ruse to work. They simply must defeat {@creature Abigor|CoA} and capture the submersible before convincing the aboleth to lure {@creature Baalzebul|CoA} into a rescue attempt. If they've done this, and the aboleth still lives, and the characters return to area B3, then read the following:": "这些角色不需要让{@creature Abigor|CoA}活着，三合会的诡计才能成功。他们只需要打败{@creature Abigor|CoA}并捕获潜水艇，然后说服鱼人{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}进行营救尝试。如果他们做到了这一点，鱼人仍然活着，并且角色返回B3区域，那么请阅读以下内容：",
	"As you prepare yourself for the arrival of the archdevil, {@creature Baalzebul|CoA}, you watch the aboleth's slimy tentacles press against various glowing sigils. A long silence ensues, punctuated only by the occasional ping as the Styx's immeasurable pressure exerts against the submersible's metal hull. Then a sigil draws itself upon the floor, lines arcing and dovetailing, flaring bright and fading swiftly. For a moment a man with features exceedingly fine appears, in shadow, and then he shrieks, his voice deepening into a grotesque gurgle as the human-form shatters, expanding into a bulging mass of flesh, until a slug-like creature looms over you.": "当你为大恶魔{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}的到来做准备时，你看着那条阿布莱斯黏滑的触手压在各种发光的符文上。 一阵长时间的沉默随之而来，只偶尔被斯提克斯河的无法估量的压力对潜水艇金属船壳施加的偶发的响声打断。然后，一个符文在地板上绘制出来，线条弯曲交错，闪亮一瞬间又迅速消失。有一瞬间，一个长相异常精致的男人出现在阴影中，然后他尖叫起来，声音变得沉重，变成了一个怪诞的咕噜声，人形状体破碎，膨胀成一团肉块，直到一个像蛞蝓一样的生物笼罩在你上方。",

An impregnable citadel, the structure is home to {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s elite forces and acts as a vault, safeguarding his most valuable possessions.": "九层地狱中最大的城市是马尔辛（Malsheem），是{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}和他的地狱军团的家园。这座城市位于内萨斯（Nessus）最大的沟壑中，从底部延伸至天空，标志着这个领域的中心。从城塔上，{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}俯瞰内萨斯，有时还会眺望其他九层地狱。该层唯一的其他建筑物，塔布加里（Tabjari），是一座建在收割者峡谷边墙上的铜制堡垒。这座坚不可摧的城堡是{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}的精英部队的驻地，也是一个保险库，保护着他最宝贵的财产。",
	"All devils native to the Nine Hells, those that don't arise from the souls of the damned, are \"born\" on Nessus. {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s true form continues to bleed from his wounds, and from this blood sprout devils. They're quickly redistributed to various other layers, depending on need and duty, with {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} keeping only the most powerful. Each archdevil answers to {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}, the Overlord of the Nine Hells, who rules from the infernal throne in Nessus. They all plot and hope to gain the throne for themselves, yet {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} has ruled the Nine Hells since their inception, and likely will continue to do so until the end of time.": "所有来自九层地狱的恶魔，那些不是由被诅咒的灵魂产生的，都是在奈萨斯（Nessus）“诞生”的。{@creature Asmodeus|CoA} 的真实形态仍然从他的伤口中流血，而从这血液中长出恶魔。它们很快被重新分配到各个不同的层，取决于需要和责任，{@creature Asmodeus|CoA} 仅保留最强大的恶魔。每位大恶魔都向九层地狱的统治者{@creature Asmodeus|CoA} 作出回应，后者从奈萨斯的地狱王座统治。他们都密谋并希望夺取王座，然而{@creature Asmodeus|CoA} 自九层地狱成立以来一直统治着，很可能会一直如此直到时间的尽头。",
	"Entrance into Nessus is nigh impossible, and rarely done. Those that choose to enter the realm do so by {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s invitation or are almost certainly destroyed by the realm's defenses. As the lowest layer in the Nine Hells, exiting Nessus is only possible by ascending into Cania. Malsheem certainly contains portals of some kind within its walls, though their location is known only to {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} and his guards—as is their destination.": "进入奈萨斯（Nessus）的入口几乎是不可能的，也很少有人这样做。那些选择进入这个领域的人要么是受到{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}的邀请，要么几乎肯定会被这个领域的防御系统摧毁。作为九层地狱中最低的一层，要离开奈萨斯只能通过升入卡尼亚（Cania）。马尔希姆（Malsheem）肯定在其墙壁内含有某种类型的传送门，尽管这些传送门的位置只有{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}和他的卫兵知道，就像它们的目的地一样。",
	"{@creature Asmodeus|CoA} knows of all that enter his realm. Without some method of concealing their presence, {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} always knows the relative location of each creature in Nessus. Visitors feel a constant state of paranoia, as if something is always watching.": "{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}知晓进入他领域的一切。如果没有一些方法来隐藏他们的存在，{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}总是知道尼萨斯中每个生物的大致位置。访客会感到持续的被监视状态，仿佛总有什么东西在观察着他们。",
	"The great gray swell of the River Styx begins to slow. Here and there great chunks of ice appear and are pushed along by the churning waters until they collide and begin accumulating into one mass that pushes up against the riverbanks. The ice becomes thick enough to stand on, but the rush of moving water below can be heard. Eventually this sound slows to a gurgling whisper and then falls silent. The ice stretches out for a distance, solid and white with arching crests where swells and rapids have frozen, and then it ends, and all that remains is empty sky. At the edge of the ice one can see out over the barren Nessus plains, vast and sprawling, reaching the far horizon. The drop below is dizzying. The powerful waters of the Styx have tumbled over the edge of the cliff and frozen into an enormous curtain of solid ice. The ground is scarcely visible, hazy with distance. Trapped within the plunging frozen waterfall is a titanic skeleton of humanoid shape dressed in gleaming armor. A giant.": "冥河(Styx)的巨大灰色浪潮开始减缓。这里那里出现了大块冰，被搅动的水流推动着，直到它们相互碰撞并开始积聚成一个质量，推向河岸。冰变得足够厚，可以站在上面，但下方奔流的水声仍然可听到。最终这种声音减缓为潺潺的低语，然后变得寂静无声。冰延伸出一段距离，坚实而洁白，拱形的山峰在那里冻结，形成了浪涌和急流，然后它结束了，剩下的只有空旷的天空。在冰的边缘，人们可以看到贫瘠的尼索斯(Nessus)平原，广阔而绵延，一直延伸到远处的地平线。下方的陡坡令人眩晕。冥河的强大水流从悬崖边瀑布而下，结冻成一幅巨大的固体冰幕。地面几乎看不见，被远处的雾气所笼罩。被困在急速冻结的瀑布中的是一具巨大的人形骨架，身着闪闪发光的盔甲。一个巨人。",
	"To reach Nessus, the characters must climb down the body of an ancient giant, half submerged in a frozen waterfall that is the last stage of the River Styx. This skeletal figure, of a scale beyond the stature of mortal Giants, is armored in gleaming mail that remains pristine and shimmers within the ice.": "要到达涅瑟斯（Nessus），角色们必须沿着一个古代巨人的身体爬下去，这个巨人半身浸没在冰冻瀑布中，那是冥河斯提克斯（River Styx）的最后阶段。这个骷髅般的身影，比凡人巨人的身材还要庞大，身披闪闪发光的铠甲，依然保持着原始的光泽，在冰中闪闪发光。",
	"Although no more than bones, some trace of life still clings to the frozen titan. Those approaching hear its voice in their head, speaking whatever language is most native to them. It names itself as {@creature Devorastus|CoA}, a warrior of law, who came to the Nine Hells unknown centuries ago and, after slaying countless devils, ended up imprisoned in the eternal ice of Cania.": "尽管只剩下骨头，但一些生命的痕迹仍然依附在这个冰冻的泰坦上。那些接近它的人会在脑海中听到它的声音，用最符合他们本族的语言说话。它自称为{@creature Devorastus|CoA}，一位法律战士，数个世纪前来到九层地狱，屠杀了无数恶魔，最终被囚禁在卡尼亚的永恒冰中。",
	"{@creature Devorastus|CoA} asks all passers-by to work towards freeing it, even if it is only to chip a few handfuls of ice away from its frozen tomb. Its words are persuasive, and an ability to read the thoughts of others permits it to tempt them with targeted inducements appealing to their morality, offering bribes, or pledging services.": "{@creature Devorastus|CoA}请求所有路人努力解救它，即使只是从它的冰冻坟墓中凿掉几把冰。它的话语具有说服力，能够读取他人的思维，诱使他们通过针对性的诱因来诱惑他们的道德感，提供贿赂或承诺服务。",
	"There is a furious commotion around the titan's head. Mortals and devils brush shoulders as they chip and claw away at the ice around it. Some seem to be working in groups, others alone, but each acts with the same desperate fervor.": "巨人头部周围一片混乱。凡人和恶魔肩并肩，不断地在冰块上凿、抓。有些人似乎是在团队中工作，有些人独自行动，但每个人都表现出同样绝望的狂热。",
	"Over time a cult of desperate dissidents has arisen around the ice-locked head of {@creature Devorastus|CoA}. Some cultists are mortal travelers who have nothing else in the plane save their hope that the giant will somehow save them. Others are actual Fiends, outcasts or rebels fleeing {@creature Mephistopheles|CoA}' ire, who intend to use the skeletal giant as their war machine to fight their former master. Thus far the archdevil is either ignorant of the cult or considers action against it not worth the resources—or it is simply amused by its folly. The score or so of cult members pick feebly at the ice covering, attempt to light fires that the cold of Cania kills, and make sacrifices in the hope the warm blood and shed life force will help free their champion.": "随着时间的推移，围绕着{@creature Devorastus|CoA}的冰封头部出现了一群绝望的异见者的异教团体。一些教众是凡人旅行者，在这个位面上除了希望这位巨人能够拯救他们之外别无他物。另一些是真正的恶魔，是{@creature Mephistopheles|CoA}的流亡者或叛乱者，他们打算利用这个骷髅巨人作为他们的战争机器，与他们的前主人作战。到目前为止，大恶魔要么对这个异教团一无所知，要么认为采取行动对他们不值得耗费资源——或者他只是对他们的愚蠢感到好笑。这些教团成员中大约有二十人，他们试图若有所思地挖掘覆盖在冰上的部分、试图点燃被卡尼亚的寒冷杀死的火焰，并做出牺牲，希望温暖的鲜血和流失的生命力能帮助解救他们的英雄。",
	"{@creature Devorastus|CoA}' vast armored form is plainly a long way from being free, and to chip a little ice away might seem a meagre price to pay to avoid the predations of the cult. However, {@creature Devorastus|CoA}' true nature is very different, and the creature is far closer to escaping than it looks. {@creature Devorastus|CoA}' actual form is similar to a gelatinous cube, currently wrapped around the bones of the titan. It is a demon, a lieutenant or perhaps rival of Juiblex, which travelled down the swift flow of the Styx before being trapped in the ice. As soon as even a small hole in the ice pierces through to the chamber it is encysted in, the creature will surge out, feed off the flesh of mortals and devils alike and then seek to return to the river in the hope it can follow the current to more hospitable climes.": "{@creature Devorastus|CoA}的庞大装甲形态显然还远未获得自由，为了避免那个教派的掠夺，凿掉一点冰似乎是微不足道的代价。然而，{@creature Devorastus|CoA}的真实本质却大不相同，这个生物比看起来更接近逃脱。{@creature Devorastus|CoA}的实际形态类似于一个明胶立方体，目前缠绕在泰坦的骨骼周围。它是一个恶魔，是朱比莱克的下属或竞争对手，曾沿着斯提克斯河的急流而下，然后被困在冰中。一旦冰层中有一个小洞穿透到它所困的空间，这个生物就会涌出来，吞食凡人和恶魔的血肉，然后寻求返回河流，希望能顺流而下到更宜居的地方。",
	"Characters must expend significant energy to free {@creature Devorastus|CoA}. Track each hour of active digging/excavating, per character, with every 30 points of fire damage counting as an additional 1 hour of effort. Once this tracker reaches 50, {@creature Devorastus|CoA} (see the accompanying stat block) is freed.": "角色必须耗费大量精力来解救{@creature Devorastus|CoA}。每位角色每小时进行挖掘/发掘活动时，每30点火焰伤害计为额外1小时的努力。一旦这个追踪器达到50，{@creature Devorastus|CoA}（请参阅附带的属性块）将被解救。",
	"Though your efforts have only produced a small, albeit deep, channel in the ice, there's a disturbing hissing noise, as if water has found its way to a tiny crack in a massive dam. A surge of pale liquid bubbles out from the hole you have created, almost instantly becoming a huge mound of ooze sticking to the ice. The trapped titan collapses as if whatever once sustained it, has escaped.": "尽管你的努力只在冰面上开了一个小而深的通道，但有一种令人不安的嘶嘶声，仿佛水已经找到了一道巨大坝上的细小裂缝。一股苍白的液体从你开的洞口冒出，几乎瞬间变成了一大团粘在冰面上的软泥。被困的泰坦崩塌了，仿佛曾经支撑它的一切都已经逃逸。",
	"The massive ooze-like demon, barely visible against the ice, climbs up or down as necessary, attempting to consume anything nearby. If no enemies are detected within 60 feet, it begins crawling upwards, in the hopes of finding a more comfortable resting place.": "这只庞大的类似软泥怪的恶魔，在冰面上几乎看不见，根据需要向上或向下爬行，试图吞噬附近的任何东西。如果在60英尺范围内没有发现敌人，它会开始向上爬行，希望找到一个更舒适的休息地点。",
	"Climbing down the titan isn't without its dangers. {@creature Shredwing|CoA|Shredwings} roost in parts of the body of the titan. {@dice 2d6} of them attack anyone descending, but once half of them are killed, the rest retreat.": "攀爬泰坦并非没有危险。{@creature Shredwing|CoA|Shredwings} 栖息在泰坦身体的某些部位。{@dice 2d6} 中的一部分会攻击任何下降的人，但一旦有一半被杀死，剩下的会撤退。",
	"If the characters enter Nessus without any protection against divination, then they are sensed by {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} immediately. He sends a force to escort them to Malsheem.": "如果角色们进入涅瑟斯(Nessus)而没有任何对抗占卜的保护措施，那么他们会立即被{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}感知到。他派遣一支部队护送他们前往马尔辛(Malsheem)。",
	"From across the arid plains there comes a distant roar. The ground trembles slightly and a hot, sweeping wind follows, sending up a curtain of red dust. A shadow passes suddenly over the land ahead of you. It is immense and slips over the distance with alarming speed. A second shadow joins it. There is another ground-shaking roar and then the sound of snarling and the rattle of weaponry. A massive fiend approaches, red, winged, and armed with a heavy metal mace. Following it are four equally large devils with dark, leathery skin and wings and six devils with enormous horns carrying tall forks with sharpened tips that glow with heat. Flanking this monstrous party are two dragons. The scales of the beasts' gleam a brilliant red and the cutting wind born of their powerful wingbeats carries with it the scent of smoke and sulfur.": "在干旱的平原上，传来遥远的咆哮声。大地微微颤动，一股炎热的扫荡风随之而来，卷起一幕红色尘土的幕帘。一道巨大的影子突然掠过你面前的土地。它巨大无比，以惊人的速度滑过远方。第二道影子加入其中。接着又是一声震天的咆哮，随之是咆哮声和武器碰撞声。一只巨大的恶魔走来，身披红色翅膀，手持沉重的金属狼牙棒。在它后面跟随着四只同样巨大的拥有黑色皮肤和翅膀的恶魔，以及六只拥有巨大角的恶魔，手持尖端闪烁热光的高叉。在这个庞大队伍的两侧是两只龙。这些巨兽的鳞片闪耀着鲜红色，他们强大的翅膀拍打所带来的劲风中夹杂着烟和硫磺的气味。",
	"The escort is led by a {@creature pit fiend} and includes four {@creature war devil|CoA|war devils} ({@adventure see appendix B|CoA|14}), six {@creature horned devil||horned devils}, and a pair of {@creature adult red dragon||adult red dragons} that the characters are to ride if they can't fly themselves. Even the most powerful characters will find this to be a difficult fight if it comes to violence, but the devils have been told to simply escort the characters, not imprison them. They only attack to defend themselves or if the characters refuse to accompany them. Proceed to the \"Adventure: Malsheem\" section.": "这支护送队伍由一个{@creature pit fiend}领导，包括四个{@creature war devil|CoA|war devils}{@adventure see appendix B|CoA|14}，六个{@creature horned devil||horned devils}，以及一对{@creature adult red dragon||adult red dragons}，供角色们骑乘，如果他们自己不能飞行。即使是最强大的角色，如果发生暴力冲突，也会发现这是一场艰难的战斗，但恶魔们被告知只是护送角色，而不是监禁他们。他们只会在自卫或者角色拒绝跟随时才会发动攻击。继续前往“冒险：玛尔辛”部分。",
	"Those traveling across Nessus can stick close to the River Lethe or strike out into the plains to avoid the traffic of devils that can be found along the river's edge. Below are two possible encounters.": "那些穿越涅索斯的旅行者可以紧贴莱西河，或者冒险进入平原，避开沿河边可以找到的恶魔交通。以下是两个可能的遭遇。",
	"The River Lethe is, if possible, less navigable than the River Styx. In many places the river plunges over vast, wild falls, and devils have had to laboriously build complex sequences of locks to permit their great river barges to safely traverse the drops.": "莱西河 (River Lethe) 在可能的情况下，比斯提克斯河 (River Styx) 更难以航行。在许多地方，这条河流从巨大的狂野瀑布上跌落，恶魔们不得不费力地建造复杂的船闸系统，以确保他们的大型河船能够安全地穿越这些陡坡。",
	"On occasion, political feuds between devils spill over into direct sabotage and action. Consignments of valuable goods—souls, sorrow wine, magic artifacts, and mortal prisoners—are wrecked or sunk as one diabolic magnate strikes indirectly against a rival. The falls of Telkalal are a favorite location for such skullduggery.": "有时，恶魔之间的政治纷争会演变为直接的破坏和行动。一位恶魔大亨间接打击对手，导致一批有价值的货物——灵魂、悲伤酒、魔法器物和凡间囚犯——被毁或沉没。泰卡拉尔瀑布是这种诡计的常见地点。",
	"The crew of a merchant's barge is desperate, running around and tripping over each other as they try to catch grappling hooks on the jagged rocks that line the top of the falls. They have little success and the few lines that draw taut snap under the weight of the barge and the strength of the water. Terrified screaming can be heard from the cargo hold. The barge jolts as another line snaps and draws closer to the edge of the falls. The screaming increases in volume. The drop of the falls is monstrous and there are towering rocks below, cutting out from the white spray like hungry teeth.": "一艘商船的船员们绝望地奔跑着，相互绊倒，试图在瀑布顶部的锯齿状岩石上抓住抛钩。他们几乎没有成功，只有少数几根绷紧的绳索在船只的重量和水流的力量下断裂。货舱里传来恐惧的尖叫声。又一根绳索断裂，船只颠簸着靠近瀑布边缘。尖叫声的音量增加了。瀑布的落差巨大，下面有高耸的岩石，从白色的水雾中伸出，就像饥饿的牙齿。",
	"The barge is carrying a tithe from the archdevil Orvrastus, intended for Nessus. The loss of this tribute will bring Orvrastus into bad odor with {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}. A variety of pettifogging bureaucratic obstinacies have resulted in {@creature Fierna|CoA} of Phlegethos becoming irritated by Orvrastus, and she has sent a team of four {@creature erinyes} to haul the barge astray. Instead of travelling into the calm waters of the locks, the erinyes are attempting to drag the vessel over the falls, while the infernal crew back the engines and launch missiles at their flying tormentors.": "驳船上载着来自大恶魔奥瓦拉斯特斯的什一税，目的地是奈萨斯。失去这份贡品将使奥瓦拉斯特斯在{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}那里声名狼藉。一系列琐碎的官僚障碍导致费列格索斯的{@creature Fierna|CoA}对奥瓦拉斯特斯感到恼火，她派遣了一队四名{@creature erinyes}来拖曳驳船偏离航道。恶毒天使们试图将船只拖向瀑布，而地狱船员则倒退引擎并向飞翔的折磨者发射导弹。",
	"A dispute between devils may not be of overt interest to mortals such as the characters, but the treasures on board may well be—whether they constitute people to be rescued or valuables to be pilfered. In the chaos of the fight, it might be possible to get on board the ship, loot it, and get off before it goes over the falls.": "恶魔之间的争执对角色等凡人可能并不引人关注，但船上的宝藏可能会——无论是需要营救的人还是值得窃取的财宝。在战斗的混乱中，有可能登上船只，掠夺宝藏，然后在它坠入瀑布之前逃离。",
	"Alternatively, the characters could assist the vessel's demise, and then hotfoot it below to sieve the River Lethe for spilled treasures. In doing so they must contend with not only the usual denizens of Nessus, but habitual mobs of infernal salvagers intent on acquiring the same riches.": "或者，角色们可以协助船只的毁灭，然后迅速下潜，筛选莱茵河（River Lethe）中溢出的宝藏。在这个过程中，他们不仅必须应对尼修斯（Nessus）的常住居民，还要面对习惯性的地狱打捞者群体，他们也渴望获取相同的财富。",
	"If the characters are successful, they obtain {@dice 4d4 x 1000} pp and one rare magic item from the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}.

	"There is a saying in the Nine Hells, that nobody works harder than {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}. The lord of all the Nine Hells neither sleeps nor rests, and whilst most of his servants devote plenty of time to sating their hedonistic pleasures, the greatest of all Fiends constantly bends his mind to the corruption of the planes and the ensnaring of souls.": "在九层地狱有句谚语，说没有人比{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}更努力。九层地狱的主宰既不睡觉也不休息，而他的大多数仆从则花大量时间满足他们的享乐欲望，而所有恶魔中最伟大的却不断用心腐化位面并诱使灵魂陷入困境。",
	"Even {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} permits himself some entertainment from time to time, though his joys are little different to his duties. At times he enjoys hunting some of the more formidable captive souls in his possession.": "即使{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}偶尔也会允许自己一些娱乐，尽管他的快乐与他的职责几乎没有什么不同。有时，他喜欢狩猎他掌控的一些更为强大的被囚禁的灵魂。",
	"Those he torments personally are, of course, lost beyond any hope of retrieval. Not one of them will ever escape his grasp. However, the finest razor edge of torment is that he persuades each one of them that there is a hope of reprieve. For his hunts, he often likes to allow his prey to think they've broken out of the prisons of Malsheem and that they've some sort of chance at freedom.": "他亲自折磨的人当然是无法挽回的。他们中没有一个能够逃脱他的掌控。然而，折磨的最尖锐之处在于他说服每一个人都有希望得到缓解。在他的猎物中，他经常喜欢让猎物误以为他们已经逃出了马尔辛的监狱，并且有某种自由的机会。",
	"A large, armored wagon, drawn by a colossal monster, careens wildly over the plains. Overhead, thin figures with feathered wings that still shine with faint celestial light swoop and fall.": "一辆巨大的装甲马车，由一只庞大的怪兽拉着，在平原上狂奔。头顶上，一些身材纤细、带着羽翼的人形生物，身上依然散发着微弱的天国光芒，翱翔着飞翔着。",
	"In this case, {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} has permitted a gang of desperados to stage a breakout, purely for the joy of hunting them down.": "在这种情况下，{@creature Asmodeus|CoA} 允许一群亡命之徒发动越狱，纯粹是为了追捕他们而感到快乐。",
	"The supposed escapees are a selection of some of the worst the mortal planes have had to offer over several centuries. Their current leader—though they fight among themselves a lot—is an orc warlord named Ormogg (neutral evil, orc {@creature assassin} with 120 hit points), whose hordes despoiled cities and burned forests and flooded dwarven holds with magma, but they've great sorcerers, wicked priests, tyrants and murderers among their ranks. As befits prisoners of the Nine Hells, each one is irredeemably evil. They've stolen—been permitted to steal—a vast armored wagon drawn by a monstrous beast, and now they ride it across the barrens of Nessus with a ragged mob of devils hounding their heels. {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} watches on, greatly amused, until he decides to send in his special hunters.": "所谓的逃犯是几个世纪以来凡间最糟糕的一些人的精选。他们目前的领袖——尽管他们经常内讧——是一位名叫奥莫格（中立邪恶，半兽人 {@creature assassin}，拥有120点生命值）的兽人军阀，他的部队掠夺了城市，烧毁了森林，用岩浆淹没了矮人要塞，但他们中有伟大的巫师、邪恶的祭司、暴君和杀人犯。作为地狱九层的囚犯，每个人都是不可救赎的邪恶。他们偷走了一辆巨大的装甲马车，由一只巨兽拉动，现在他们骑着它穿越涅瑟斯的荒原，身后跟着一群群魔鬼。{@creature Asmodeus|CoA} 观看着，非常高兴，直到他决定派遣他的特别猎人。",
	"This might be an opportunity to resurface villains from earlier in the character's adventures before they ventured into the Nine Hells, having them side with Ormogg in this prison break. Alternatively have the prisoners be comprised of an {@creature archmage}, four {@creature priest||priests}, six {@creature gladiator||gladiators} and eight {@creature veteran||veterans}. The creature pulling their wagon is a {@creature miasmorne|CoA} ({@adventure see appendix B|CoA|14}) but it isn't truly under their control, at any moment it might turn upon them.": "这可能是一个机会，让角色在他们进入九层地狱之前的冒险中再次出现早期的恶棍，让他们在这次越狱中与奥莫格一起行动。或者让囚犯包括一个{@creature archmage}，四个{@creature priest||priests}，六个{@creature gladiator||gladiators}和八个{@creature veteran||veterans}。拉着他们马车的生物是一个{@creature miasmorne|CoA} ({@adventure see appendix B|CoA|14})，但它并不完全受他们控制，随时可能反目。",
	"{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s former captives are well used to the torment of Fiends. His Bright Hounds are something else. The breaking of angels is an especial pleasure to the lords of the Nine Hells. {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} revels in perverting them to his while, twisting them into cruel falcons. He has stables of them, no longer resembling angels but their radiant power might still bite the hand that unhoods them. They represent an additional test of his mastery that makes the whole hunt truly interesting.": "{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}的前俘虏们已经习惯了恶魔的折磨。他的明亮猎犬们却是另一回事。将天使摧毁对九层地狱的领主们来说是一种特别的快乐。{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}乐此不疲地将它们扭曲成残忍的猎鹰。他有一群这样的天使，虽然不再像天使，但它们的光芒力量仍可能反噬解开束缚的手。它们代表了他掌握能力的额外考验，使整个狩猎变得真正有趣。",
	"The Bright Hounds are comprised of four {@creature deva||devas} and two {@creature planetar||planetars} (lawful evil and delivering necrotic damage instead of radiant). The characters, encountering the wagon on its headlong flight, might get involved in a variety of ways. The wagon's inhabitants, believing they know a way out of Nessus (which conveniently is at the Oasis of the Lethe, but is also just a lie planted by {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}) may offer them a place aboard in return for fighting off the devils—only to be revealed as monsters almost as bad as the devils outside. The angelic hunters may provoke pity, though there is little the characters can do for them save end them.": "明亮猎犬由四名{@creature deva||devas}和两名{@creature planetar||planetars}(守序邪恶，使用死灵伤害代替光辉)组成。角色们在追赶这辆马车时，可能以各种方式参与其中。马车上的居民相信他们知道一条通往奈萨斯的出路（方便地位于遗忘绿洲，但实际上只是{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}种下的谎言），他们可能会提供角色们上车的机会，作为回报，要求角色们击退恶魔，但最终会发现这些居民几乎和外面的恶魔一样糟糕。天使猎手可能引起怜悯，尽管角色们除了结束他们外几乎无能为力。",
	"Everything within Nessus' bounds is the unchallenged domain of {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}, yet the Oasis exists just slightly beyond. Enough to satisfy the legalistic minds of devils, perhaps. The River Lethe runs through Nessus, heedless of topography, reaches the edge of the wasteland and just keeps going. It flows forever into the red void, eerie, discomfiting, and unexplained. The greatest infernal minds can't account for it, nor any god that has been petitioned for an answer. What lies at the end of the Lethe? Does it empty out into another constellation of planes? The question has ever troubled philosophers and cosmologists. And so, on the banks of the Lethe, a community of scholars and wizards has arisen to study this phenomenon and, through it, the underlying nature of the planes themselves. The Oasis of the Lethe is their haven.": "在{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}的辖区内，一切都是无可挑战的，然而绿洲却存在于略远之处。或许足以满足恶魔那种爱较真的头脑。莱西河穿过涅瑟斯，无视地形，抵达荒原边缘后继续流淌。它永远地流向红色虚空，诡异、令人不安，无法解释。即使是最伟大的地狱思想家也无法解释，任何被请求回答的神祇也无法。莱西河的尽头是什么？它是否流入另一个星座的位面？这个问题一直困扰着哲学家和宇宙学家。因此，在莱西河岸边，一群学者和巫师的社区已经兴起，研究这一现象，以及位面本身的基本性质。莱西绿洲是他们的避风港。",
	"{@creature Koh Tam|CoA} previously gave the characters an infernal map. Show the players the map of the Oasis of the Lethe in {@adventure appendix F|CoA|18}.

	"There are certainly threats that come to trouble those at the oasis. Inexplicable monsters sometimes undulate out of the red void—bizarre beasts never seen before and never replicated. Whilst they represent unparalleled opportunities for study, they also devour the occasional student. Desperate fugitive souls and marauding adventurers fleeing {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s pursuit occasionally find their way to the Oasis and make demands of the arch-magister Elihandrel, though thus far his magical abilities have sufficed to return them to the archdevil's custody in short order. Sometimes conjurations called up by the mages themselves get loose and have a brief career of havoc before they're banished once more. But from the devils of the Nine Hells themselves, there is no threat. They're as obliging as the most unctuous servants.": "在绿洲，肯定会有一些威胁困扰着那里的人。有时，无法解释的怪物会从红色虚空中蠕动而出——这些奇异的生物从未被见过，也从未被复制过。虽然它们代表着无与伦比的研究机会，但它们也会偶尔吞噬学生。绝望的逃亡灵魂和逃离{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}追捕的掠夺者有时会找到通往绿洲的道路，并向大魔导师Elihandrel提出要求，尽管到目前为止，他的魔法能力足以迅速将他们送回大恶魔的监管之下。有时，由魔法师召唤出的幻象会逃脱，短暂地制造混乱，然后再次被驱逐。但来自九层地狱的恶魔本身并不构成威胁。它们像最恭顺的仆人一样乐于助人。",
	"Some of the major locations found in the oasis are described below.": "绿洲中一些主要地点的描述如下。",
	"The Oasis is a floating island seemingly tethered magically to the endless flow of the River Lethe, a mile out from Nessus' edge. In contrast to the barren plane, it is green and verdant, thronging with life. There are trees meticulously trained together to form living buildings; there are pools of sparkling water that promise refreshment. Animals and birds dwell here, apparently without fear of mortal or devil. Lions and lambs, serpents and deer, all living in harmony.": "绿洲是一个漂浮的岛屿，似乎被魔法系牢固地连接在尼修斯(Nessus)边缘无尽流动的莱西河(River Lethe)上。与贫瘠的平原形成鲜明对比，这里一片翠绿，充满生机。树木被精心训练在一起，形成活生生的建筑；有闪闪发光的水池，让人心生清凉。动物和鸟类居住在这里，似乎毫无对凡人或恶魔的恐惧。狮子和羔羊，蛇和鹿，所有生物和谐共处。",
	"Within the buildings of the Oasis there are libraries that would make a sage weep, telescopes and scrying pools and all manner of divinatory instruments to look into Nessus and the river and the wider planes. There are debating rooms and places for quiet contemplation. Any mortal who has ever valued the pursuit of knowledge instantly feels that they've come home.": "在绿洲的建筑物内，有着让智者痛哭的图书馆，望远镜、占卜池和各种占卜工具，可以窥视涅瑟斯、河流和更广阔的位面。还有辩论室和静思之地。任何珍视知识追求的凡人都会立刻感到仿佛回到了家中。",
	"Some of the planes' greatest minds can be found here studying the intrinsic nature of the cosmos—both the living who have made the arduous journey and the souls of the dead. {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} sporadically signs orders releasing the most learned of scholars within his domain from their torments so that they may aid in the research of the Oasis. The prospect of questioning the great minds of elder days is enough to bring some visitors to the community here.": "一些飞机的最伟大头脑可以在这里找到，研究宇宙的固有本质——包括那些已经完成艰苦旅程的生者和死者的灵魂。{@creature Asmodeus|CoA} 时不时地签署命令，释放他领地内最博学的学者，让他们帮助研究绿洲。有机会询问古老时代伟大头脑的前景足以吸引一些访客来到这个社区。",
	"One of the most respected minds of the current roster of scholars at the Oasis is that of Aldri Teskethmus, a living human {@creature archmage} of the Red Wizards, who theorizes that the traditional arrangement of the planes is merely an artifact of mortals' limited ability to comprehend the wider universe.": "在绿洲现有学者中，最受尊敬的思想家之一是艾尔德里·特斯凯斯穆斯（Aldri Teskethmus），一位来自红袍巫师的活着的人类{@creature archmage}，他认为传统的位面安排仅仅是凡人有限理解更广阔宇宙的产物。",

	"It is an inevitable fact that those long-dead souls at the Oasis are mostly of evil persuasion. There are other incautious mortals who fall into {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s power, but the majority of souls in his domain are those drawn to the Nine Hells by the choices they made in life. However, the arch-magister of the Oasis, Elihandrel (use {@creature empyrean} stats but Elihandrel is Medium sized), keeps order. His word is law, as much as {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s is within Malsheem. Those who won't abide by his codes of peace and scholarly amity know that a return to the Nine Hells awaits.": "在绿洲的那些长已逝去的灵魂大多是邪恶倾向是一个不可避免的事实。还有其他一些粗心大意的凡人会落入{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}的权力之下，但他领地中的大多数灵魂是因为他们在生前所做的选择而被引向九层地狱。然而，绿洲的大魔导师Elihandrel（使用{@creature empyrean}的属性，但Elihandrel是中等体型）维持秩序。他的话语就是法律，就像{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}在玛尔辛的地位一样。那些不遵守他的和平与学术友好准则的人知道，他们将会回到九层地狱。",
	"Elihandrel himself is an ageless high elf, robed in simple grey. He appears mild, confident in his authority and power, proud of the peaceful community he has built. His soft-spoken word is the end of any disagreements, ensuring that those under his charge never let civilized debate get out of hand. His guests have everything they need—the trees bear endlessly nutritious fruit and there are always books, tools, and scholars' supplies of surpassing quality. He even sanctions research expeditions to other layers of the Nine Hells. At his beck and call are a staff of curiously meek devils, still monstrous of aspect but on their very best behavior. Elihandrel himself reports to {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} on a regular basis, sharing all the knowledge that his faculty uncovers. He denies that he is in any way enabling evil. Learning, he insists, is without alignment. His ultimate goal is to push past the adversarial model of the universe that has trapped all life in constant conflict, law against chaos, good against evil. He genuinely believes that a full understanding of the planes can lead to a perfect future without hardship or sin.": "伊利汉德雷尔(Elihandrel)本人是一位永恒的高等精灵，身穿简朴的灰色长袍。他看起来温和自信，对自己的权威和力量充满自豪，为他建立的和平社区感到自豪。他说话轻声细语，一言九鼎，确保手下的人永远不会让文明辩论失控。他的客人拥有一切所需——树木不断结出营养丰富的水果，总是有书籍、工具和卓越品质的学者用品。他甚至批准前往九层地狱的研究探险。在他的召唤下，一群态度奇特温顺的恶魔随时待命，虽然外表仍然恶魔，但举止端庄。伊利汉德雷尔本人定期向{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}汇报，分享他的团队发现的所有知识。他否认自己以任何方式在助长邪恶。他坚称，学习与阵营无关。他的最终目标是超越宇宙中困扰所有生命的对抗模式，法则对抗混沌，善对抗恶。他真诚地相信，对各个位面的全面了解可以引领人类走向一个没有困难或罪恶的完美未来。",
	"Elihandrel is very eager to spread word of his faculty out into the wider planes. He maintains correspondence with a number of temples, universities, and mage schools on the mortal planes. Whilst the appeal of studying the secrets of the Nine Hells is plain to evil mages and luminaries of all kinds, Elihandrel is very keen to maintain balance by attracting those of other aspects as well. He writes persuasively of the possibility of studying the heart of evil with an eye to countering its influences. One must truly understand a thing before one can defeat it, is his frequent refrain. Scholars visiting the Oasis from the mortal planes find the opportunities of the place overwhelming. There is always something new to learn—and not just miserly scraps but the great truths of the universe hanging just out of reach like fruit ready to be plucked. Conversation with other resident scholars is transcendent, opening the doors of the mind. Very few ever want to leave once they arrive.": "Elihandrel非常渴望将他的学院的声誉传播到更广阔的位面。他与几所位于凡间的寺庙、大学和法师学校保持联系。虽然研究九层地狱的秘密对邪恶法师和各种杰出人物具有吸引力，但Elihandrel非常热衷于通过吸引其他方面的人来保持平衡。他动情地描述了研究邪恶之心并着眼于对抗其影响的可能性。在能够击败一样东西之前，人必须真正理解它，这是他经常强调的。来自凡间的学者在绿洲发现了这个地方的机遇令人难以置信。这里总有新的东西可以学习——不仅仅是吝啬的碎片，而是宇宙的伟大真理就像成熟的水果一样悬在眼前等待被摘取。与其他驻地学者的交谈是超凡脱俗的，打开了心灵的大门。一旦他们到达，很少有人愿意离开。",

Magnificent marble pillars line the hallways, dividing them into sections, and each section stretches off until it is lost in distant shadows. There are upper levels, and these also grow faint as they rise beyond where the eye can see. Elaborate, curling staircases descend underground, suggesting further levels below, and rise upward until they vanish.

Despite being beyond Nessus' physical borders, the Oasis remains in {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s domain, and Elihandrel must pay rent for his tenure there. At irregular intervals, carefully calculated by complex infernal clocks, the forces of the Nine Hells visit the Oasis and sweep it bare of everyone save Elihandrel himself. Every scholar and soul is hauled off to Malsheem, to be dissected for all they know and then put to eternal service or suffering as {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} prefers. To study at the Oasis is to tacitly permit the Nine Hells a claim to your soul, and over the centuries the archdevil has drained the best and brightest minds of the planes by indulging Elihandrel's little project. The arch-magister himself considers the deal unfortunate, but a small matter compared to the vast reams of learning that his charges uncover. After all, the libraries remain intact. Nothing, therefore, is truly lost.": "{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}与Elihandrel达成的交易几乎没有人知晓。一旦大执政官收取，没有人真正有机会谈论它。尽管超出了奈萨斯的物理边界，绿洲仍然属于{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}的领地，Elihandrel必须为他在那里的任期支付租金。由于复杂的地狱时钟精确计算的不规则间隔，九层地狱的力量会造访绿洲，并将其横扫一空，除了Elihandrel本人。每位学者和灵魂都会被带到Malsheem，被解剖出所有他们知道的东西，然后按照{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}的喜好永恒地服役或受苦。在绿洲学习意味着默认地允许九层地狱对你的灵魂提出索赔，几个世纪以来，大执政官通过纵容Elihandrel的小项目耗尽了各个位面最优秀和最聪明的头脑。大法师本人认为这笔交易不幸，但与他的学生们揭示的广阔知识相比，这只是小事。毕竟，图书馆仍然完好无损。因此，没有真正失去任何东西。",

The scream is joined by another, and then another, and the roar too gains company until the cold, marble halls echo with a cacophony of gleeful snarls and beastly roars and terrified, pained screaming and wailing shrieks.": "图书馆里传来一声强烈的撞击声，随后是一声咆哮和一声刺耳的尖叫。尖叫声接连不断，然后又是另一声，咆哮声也有了伴奏，直到寒冷的大理石走廊回荡着一片充满欢乐的咆哮声、野兽般的咆哮声、恐惧的、痛苦的尖叫声和哀嚎的尖叫声。",

	"The learning of the Oasis, that seems infinitely convincing to all the scholars who debate within its leafy halls, doesn't travel. Like a wine of uncertain vintage, the further you carry it from its region of origin, the less satisfying the taste. The cast-iron logic of Elihandrel and his fellows weakens, or else becomes abstruse, impossible to follow. It all sounds very intelligent until someone starts picking at the details, and then it seems to mean nothing at all. {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s last joke on the Oasis is that almost everything that those serious and high-minded scholars write down is complete nonsense once taken away from the curious influence of the Oasis itself. Almost everything. The final barb of the archdevil is that every so often something that Elihandrel disseminates to the wider planes turns out to be of incalculable value, a true insight for the ages, perhaps even a weapon that can be turned against the Nine Hells. Those little scraps of true value mean that even those scholars who suspect the true nature of the Oasis still hear the siren call of temptation. After all, are they not the greatest minds of the age? Surely, they will be shrewd enough to outwit the trap the Oasis represents. And {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} smiles to himself as yet another great sage descends to Nessus clutching one of Elihandrel's invitations, because there is no pride sweeter than the folly of the wise.": "那个绿荫蔽日的绿洲的学识，似乎能够无限地说服所有在其叶茂密大厅内辩论的学者们，却无法传播。就像一种年代不明的葡萄酒，你离开它的原产地越远，它的味道就越不尽人意。Elihandrel及其同僚们的铁证逻辑变得薄弱，或者变得深奥，难以理解。所有的一切听起来都很聪明，直到有人开始挑剔细节，然后似乎什么都不意味着。{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}对绿洲的最后一个玩笑是，那些认真而高尚的学者们写下的几乎所有东西，一旦远离绿洲本身那种神秘的影响，就变成了完全无意义的胡言乱语。几乎所有的东西。大恶魔的最后一击是，偶尔Elihandrel传播到更广阔位面的某些东西竟然具有无法估量的价值，是一个真正的时代洞见，甚至可能是一个可以对抗九层地狱的武器。那些真正有价值的小片段意味着，即使那些怀疑绿洲真实本质的学者们仍然听到了诱惑的诱惑之声。毕竟，他们不是这个时代最伟大的头脑吗？他们肯定足够精明，可以瞒过绿洲所代表的陷阱。当又一位伟大的贤者拿着Elihandrel的邀请函降临到奈萨斯时，{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}对自己微笑着，因为没有什么比智者的愚蠢更让人自豪了。",

	"Malsheem is a behemoth of a city. It stretches from the bottom of a deep, jagged trench to the heights of Nessus' blood red sky, its towers and flagpoles stabbing like spears through the thick, roiling clouds overhead. In width it is also massive, swollen so greatly that the giant trench in which it lies seems a tight fit. There is a strange and frightening beauty to the place. Even from a distance you can see that the city's walls are uniform and polished, the curling spires of its palaces are precise and elegant and everywhere there is the gleam of precious metal and the light of burning fires.": "玛尔希姆(Malsheem)是一个巨大的城市。它从一个深邃、崎岖的沟壑底部一直延伸到尼萨斯(Nessus)血红色的天空，其塔楼和旗杆如同长矛刺破了头顶厚重、翻腾的云层。在宽度上也是庞大的，膨胀得如此之大，以至于它所在的巨大沟壑似乎显得有些狭窄。这个地方有一种奇异而令人恐惧的美。即使从远处看，你也能看到这座城市的墙壁是整齐而光滑的，宫殿的螺旋尖塔精确而优雅，到处都闪耀着珍贵金属的光芒和燃烧火焰的光辉。",
	"There are several ways the characters might arrive at the city: captured upon entering Nessus and taken directly to Malsheem, brought here as captives of the Dukes—some brave characters may even choose to walk into the city themselves. No matter how they get here, they always enter through the city gates of Malsheem. Here they're met by an escort of two {@creature pit fiend||pit fiends} and eight {@creature horned devil||horned devils} who announce that they're to be guests in the palace of {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}. The characters can go with them or attack. If they attack, the devils are joined by another pit fiend on initiative count 15 of every round. Once defeated, the characters are deposited at the palace for an audience with The Triad.": "角色可能会以几种方式抵达这座城市：被俘后进入尼萨斯并直接被带到马尔辛，作为公爵的俘虏被带到这里——一些勇敢的角色甚至可能选择自己走进这座城市。无论他们如何到达这里，他们总是通过马尔辛的城门进入。在这里，他们会被两名 {@creature pit fiend||pit fiends} 和八名 {@creature horned devil||horned devils} 的护卫迎接，他们会宣布他们将成为 {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} 宫殿的客人。角色可以跟随他们或发动攻击。如果他们发动攻击，恶魔们会在每轮的15号先攻上加入另一只深渊魔王。一旦被打败，角色将被送到宫殿与三位一体进行会面。",
	"When the characters arrive at the palace, they are confronted by the three archdevils known as the Triad.": "当角色们抵达皇宫时，他们被三位被称为三巨头的大恶魔所对抗。",
	"This triumvirate of bloated devils were angels once, who fell alongside their master back at the dawn of all things. Rather than committing to taking arms against the gods or embracing their fate, they attempted to play lawyer with the divine. For an age they sought to escape their fate by exploiting technicalities in what it truly meant to rebel or be counted among the supporters of {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}. Eventually, their legalistic hair-splitting failed, and the gods delivered them to their master, who viewed them with utter contempt. He transformed them from their radiant angelic forms into great floating sacs of flesh and made them his notaries, so they could exercise their lawyerly talents in his service.": "这三个膨胀的恶魔曾经是天使，与他们的主人一起堕落于万物诞生之初。与其对抗众神或接受命运，他们试图与神明辩解。他们试图通过利用技术上的细微差别来逃避命运，不论是叛逆还是被{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}支持者。多年来，他们试图逃避命运，但最终失败了。众神将他们交给了他们的主人，后者对他们深感蔑视。他将他们从光辉的天使形态变成了漂浮的巨大肉囊，并让他们成为他的记录官，以便他们可以在他的服务中发挥他们的律师才能。",
	"The Triad might appear homogenous to mortals at first sight, but they have different natures and predilections.

In those rare occasions where a mortal advances a line of argument that interests or surprises him, he has been known to recruit them to his staff of twisted legal minds—as an alternative to having {@creature Asmodeus|CoA}'s eternal enmity.

Their greatest weapon, in the fray, is that those who are bound by infernal contracts are automatically vulnerable to their powers. In the small print of all their agreements is a clause of implied consent, so that every spell cast by the Triad can evade any attempt at resistance, and any physical defense comes to nothing. When you sign the contracts of the Nine Hells, you really are agreeing to get everything you deserve, whether you want it or not.": "(请查看随附的属性块) 是折磨者。她的角色是一旦{@creature Zagum|CoA}已经证明了它们的约束性质毋庸置疑，就要执行合同。她那可怕的大嘴可以永远地咀嚼灵魂，她是绝对没有怜悯心的，是法律的不可动摇的鞭子。当三位一体被迫战斗时，{@creature Buer|CoA}带来了身体上的威胁，而其他两位依靠魔法来支持她。他们在战斗中最大的武器是，那些被地狱契约束缚的人自动对他们的力量脆弱。在所有协议的小字条款中都有一项隐含同意的条款，这样一来，三位一体施放的每个法术都可以规避任何抵抗尝试，任何物理防御都无济于事。当你签署九层地狱的合同时，你真的是在同意得到你应得的一切，无论你是否想要。",
	"The Triad acknowledges that the characters have likely come to Malsheem to nullify the contracts that bind either them or one of their loved ones. They have the power to nullify the contracts, but only if the characters give an item of value or provide a service.": "三合会承认角色们很可能来到了(Malsheem)来废除束缚他们或他们所爱之人的契约。他们有能力废除这些契约，但前提是角色们必须提供一件有价值的物品或提供一项服务。",
	"In the event the characters come before the Triad after being captured by the Dukes, they may not have gathered all needed phylacteries. It should be clear to them that performing a service for the Triad is their best option. If they agree to do this, they're allowed to leave the palace. They can collect the phylacteries, capture {@creature Abigor|CoA}, and resume negotiations.": "如果角色在被公爵俘虏后遇到三合会，他们可能还没有收集到所有必需的魂器。对他们来说，明确表明为三合会效劳是最佳选择。如果他们同意这样做，他们将被允许离开宫殿。他们可以收集魂器，俘虏{@creature Abigor|CoA}，然后恢复谈判。",
	"The characters could opt to trick {@creature Baalzebul|CoA} into leaving Maladomini, so that {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} can turn the archdevil back into his slug form. To do this they must capture {@creature Baalzebul|CoA}'s trusted lieutenant {@creature Abigor|CoA}. {@creature Asmodeus|CoA} knows exactly where the infernal submersible that {@creature Abigor|CoA} captains can be found. Once they capture the submersible, they must use the aboleth within the infernal submersible to lure {@creature Baalzebul|CoA} into trying to rescue {@creature Abigor|CoA}. When {@creature Baalzebul|CoA} turns into a slug and realizes he has been tricked, he does everything in his power to kill the characters.": "角色可以选择欺骗{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}离开马拉多米尼，这样{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}就可以将大恶魔变回他的蛞蝓形态。为了做到这一点，他们必须捕获{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}的亲信副手{@creature Abigor|CoA}。{@creature Asmodeus|CoA}确切地知道{@creature Abigor|CoA}船长的地狱潜水艇的位置。一旦他们捕获了潜水艇，他们必须利用潜水艇内的鱼人来诱使{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}试图营救{@creature Abigor|CoA}。当{@creature Baalzebul|CoA}变成蛞蝓并意识到自己被欺骗时，他会竭尽全力杀死这些角色。",

	"This final negotiation is influenced by the choices the characters made during their time in the Nine Hells. If they're corrupted their options are severely limited.
