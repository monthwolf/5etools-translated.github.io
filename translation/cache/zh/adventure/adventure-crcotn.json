	"Long ago, a war between gods of good and evil scoured the surface of the world of Exandria. Both the noble Prime Deities and the selfish Betrayer Gods imbued their mortal champions with supernatural gifts that granted them strength enough to challenge their divine foes. The greatest of these champions was Alyxian the Apotheon, who received the blessings of three Prime Deities to save the world from the apocalyptic power of the Betrayer Gods.": "很久以前，一场善恶之神之间的战争席卷了埃克桑德里亚世界的表面。高贵的主神和自私的背叛者诸神都给他们的凡人冠军灌输了超自然的天赋，使他们有足够的力量来挑战他们的神性敌人。这些冠军中最伟大的是阿普斯安，他得到了三位主神的祝福，从背叛者诸神的末日力量中拯救了世界。",
	"Centuries later, all knowledge of this godlike hero has been lost to time, and two groups of adventurers are called upon to retrace this mythic hero's steps and free him from his timeless prison. The tale begins in lands familiar to {@i Critical Role} fans—the war-scarred wastes of Xhorhas and the glimmering oasis city of Ank'Harel—but ultimately stretches beyond the Material Plane to a realm of lightless despair known as the Netherdeep.": "几个世纪后，所有关于这位神一样的英雄的知识都被时间湮没了，两组冒险家被召唤去追溯这位神话英雄的足迹，并把他从永恒的监狱中解救出来。这个故事开始于{@i Critical Role}粉丝熟悉的土地--战火纷飞的Xhorhas荒原和闪闪发光的绿洲城市Ank'Harel，但最终延伸到物质世界之外的一个无光的绝望境界，即尼瑟德普。",
	"This adventure is set in Exandria, the world of {@i Critical Role}. Its continents include Tal'Dorei, Wildemount, Marquet, and Issylra. The adventure begins in a region of Wildemount called Xhorhas and transitions to the great Marquesian oasis city of Ank'Harel.

Each season is a complete Dungeons & Dragons campaign that revolves around a particular band of lovably flawed heroes, with Matthew Mercer guiding the narrative and breathing life into the world of Exandria as the show's Dungeon Master. Like any D&D game, the show is full of drama, laughter, silly voices, dice rolls, and stories that will live on in infamy.": "{@i Critical Role}是一个直播节目，在周四晚上播出，由配音演员特拉维斯-威灵汉、玛丽莎-雷、萨姆-里格尔、塔利辛-贾菲、阿什利-约翰逊、利亚姆-奥布莱恩、劳拉-贝利和马修-默瑟主演。每一季都是一个完整的龙与地下城活动，围绕着一群可爱的有缺陷的英雄，由马修-默瑟作为该剧的地下城主引导叙事并为艾克桑德里亚的世界注入活力。就像任何D&D游戏一样，该剧充满了戏剧性、笑声、愚蠢的声音、掷骰子，以及将流传于世的故事。",
	"A cataclysmic war among gods and mortals occurred on Exandria centuries ago. This war, known as the Calamity, ended when the Prime Deities locked their evil brethren—and themselves—behind a Divine Gate that prevents the gods from directly interfering with the affairs of mortals. The gods can still bestow power upon their faithful and send powerful supernatural beings to help enact their will, but they can't directly touch the mortal works of Exandria.": "几个世纪前，埃克桑德里亚发生了一场众神和凡人之间的灾难性战争。这场被称为 \"灾难 \"的战争，在主神将他们的邪恶同胞--以及他们自己--锁在神门之后而结束，神门阻止了诸神直接干涉凡人的事务。诸神仍然可以将力量赋予他们的信徒，并派遣强大的超自然生物来帮助实现他们的意志，但他们不能直接接触艾克桑德里亚的凡人作品。",

	"Xhorhas, on the continent of Wildemount, was once a land dominated by the Betrayer Gods. It was their seat of power during the Calamity, and after their defeat, it was left a war-scarred wasteland prowled by demons. Today, it is a land populated by diverse creatures and people often considered to be monsters by their neighbor, the totalitarian Dwendalian Empire. The dominant political power in Xhorhas is the Kryn Dynasty, founded by drow who fled the Underdark and escaped the fell influence of Lolth the Spider Queen. They have discovered the power of an unusual deity of light and rebirth called the Luxon. The Bright Queen Leylas Kryn leads her people to glory in this blighted land.": "荒野大陆上的Xhorhas，曾经是背叛者之神统治的土地。在灾变期间，这里是他们的权力所在地，在他们被打败后，这里就变成了一片被战争毁坏的荒地，到处是恶魔。今天，它是一个由不同的生物和人居住的土地，通常被他们的邻居，极权主义的德文达尔帝国认为是怪物。Xhorhas的主导政治力量是Kryn王朝，由逃离暗黑世界的乌鸦建立，并躲避蜘蛛女王Lolth的影响。他们发现了一个不寻常的光明和重生的神灵的力量，这个神灵叫做卢克逊。光明女王莱伊拉斯-克莱恩（Leylas Kryn）带领她的人民在这片枯萎的土地上获得荣耀。",
	"Many beings lived in the wastes of Xhorhas before the drow of the Kryn Dynasty escaped the Underdark and built their civilization on the surface. Goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears, orcs, lizardfolk, kobolds, and countless other beings have banded together under the banner of the Kryn Dynasty—some willingly, others under duress.": "在克莱恩王朝的乌鸦逃离暗黑世界并在地面上建立他们的文明之前，许多生物都生活在霍哈斯的荒野上。哥布林、霍布林、虫人、兽人、蜥蜴人、哥布林，以及无数其他生命在克莱恩王朝的旗帜下联合起来--有些是自愿的，有些则是被胁迫的。",
	"Xhorhasian locations the characters will visit in this adventure include the settlements of Jigow and Bazzoxan, both described below.": "在这次冒险中，人物将访问的Xhorhasian地点包括Jigow和Bazzoxan的定居点，这两个地方将在下面介绍。",
	"The military encampment of Bazzoxan keeps watch over the Betrayers' Rise, a dark temple that was instrumental to the Betrayer Gods during the Calamity. Xhorhasian explorers and settlers built the foundation of a new city around the looming stone structures of the abandoned sanctum—until demonic forces from within the old temple threw the burgeoning society into chaos.": "巴佐桑的军营一直在监视背叛者的崛起，这是一座黑暗的神庙，在灾变期间对背叛者的神灵很有帮助。Xhorhasian探险家和定居者围绕着这个被遗弃的圣殿的隐约的石头结构建立了一个新的城市的基础--直到来自旧神庙内的恶魔力量将这个新兴的社会带入混乱。",
	"As the characters discover in {@adventure chapter 3|CRCotN|3}, Bazzoxan is now locked in a stalemate between the Kryn Dynasty's forces and the demons of the Betrayers' Rise. This unholy site is the subject of constant research and of growing worry for the dynasty.": "正如人物在{@adventure chapter 3|CRCotN|3}中所发现的那样，巴佐桑现在正处于克里恩王朝的军队和背叛者崛起的恶魔之间的僵持状态。这个邪恶的地方是王朝不断研究的对象，也是王朝越来越担心的对象。",
	"The continent of Marquet is scarred by a vast, arid desert, which was created long ago when the Betrayer God known as Gruumsh the Ruiner struck a cataclysmic blow with his spear into Marquet's lush jungles. Within this desert is one of the greatest city-states known to the mortals of this age: Ank'Harel, also called the Jewel of Hope.": "马奎特大陆上有一片巨大的干旱沙漠，这是很久以前被称为 \"毁灭者格鲁姆什 \"的背叛者之神用他的长矛对马奎特的茂密丛林进行了一次灾难性的打击后形成的。在这片沙漠中，有一个为这个时代的凡人所知的最伟大的城邦。Ank'Harel，也被称为希望之宝。",
	"Traders who needed to traverse the desert to sell their wares founded Ank'Harel around an oasis, unknowingly locating their new home above the sunken ruins of an elven city called Cael Morrow, which was destroyed by Gruumsh in the same spear thrust that laid waste to much of the continent.": "需要穿越沙漠出售商品的商人们在一片绿洲周围建立了安克哈雷尔，他们不知道自己的新家位于一座名为凯尔-莫罗（Cael Morrow）的精灵城市的沉没废墟之上，这座城市被格鲁姆什在摧毁大陆大部分地区的同一支长矛中摧毁。",

	"Beneath Ank'Harel lie the remains of a former Marquesian metropolis. Its true name is lost to time, since nearly all records from before the Calamity were obliterated when Gruumsh destroyed the city. Modern scholars call it Cael Morrow, the Drowned City. The epithet refers to the fact that the ruins are submerged in a vast underground cistern—part of the same body of water that feeds the oasis that gives life to the city.": "在Ank'Harel的下面，有一个前侯赛因大都市的遗迹。它的真实名字已经被时间湮没，因为几乎所有灾难前的记录都在格鲁姆什摧毁该城市时被抹去了。现代学者称其为Cael Morrow，即淹没的城市。这个称谓是指废墟被淹没在一个巨大的地下蓄水池中--这也是滋养绿洲的水体的一部分，而绿洲赋予了这座城市生命。",
	"Hidden within Cael Morrow is a rift to the Netherdeep, which the characters discover in {@adventure chapter 5|CRCotN|5}.": "在Cael Morrow中隐藏着一个通往Netherdeep的裂缝，人物在{@adventure chapter 5|CRCotN|5}中发现了它。",
	"A realm of despair, the Netherdeep was created when the spear of Gruumsh pierced through the Material Plane and into the Elemental Plane of Water. It is an extraplanar labyrinth of lightless trenches, infused with the distorted emotions of a demigod who is both the Netherdeep's prisoner and jailer. This location awaits the characters in {@adventure chapter 6|CRCotN|6}.": "一个绝望的领域，Netherdeep是在Gruumsh的长矛刺穿物质界并进入水元素界时产生的。它是一个由无光壕沟组成的星外迷宫，注入了一个半神的扭曲情绪，他既是Netherdeep的囚徒，也是狱卒。这个地方在{@adventure chapter 6|CRCotN|6}中等待着人物。",
	"Two moons hang in the sky of Exandria. One is Catha, a large, pale orb that cycles through its phases once per month. The other is Ruidus, a ghostly vermilion satellite that circles Exandria once every six months.": "埃克桑德里亚的天空中悬挂着两个月亮。一个是卡塔，一个大而苍白的球体，每个月循环一次其阶段。另一个是Ruidus，一个幽灵般的朱红色卫星，每六个月绕艾克桑德里亚一圈。",
	"Catha's brightness is constant, its phases predictable. Conversely, Ruidus exhibits strange behavior, seeming to glow more brightly at times or suddenly casting off its shadow to appear full. The vermilion moon often disappears from the night sky entirely, while at other times it unexpectedly flares with bright, ruddy light.": "Catha的亮度是恒定的，它的阶段是可预测的。相反，Ruidus表现出奇怪的行为，有时似乎会发出更亮的光，或突然投下它的阴影，显得很饱满。朱红色的月亮经常从夜空中完全消失，而在其他时候，它却意外地闪现出明亮的红光。",
	"Not all people fear Ruidus, but superstitions about it are widespread across Exandria. Some of the more well-known superstitions include the following:": "并非所有的人都害怕Ruidus，但关于它的迷信在整个Exandria广泛存在。一些比较知名的迷信包括以下内容。",
	"Those who are born on a night when Ruidus is full are destined to bring suffering to others or to experience great tragedy in their own lives.": "那些在Ruidus满员的夜晚出生的人，注定要给别人带来痛苦，或者在自己的生活中经历巨大的悲剧。",
	"Those who study Ruidus and become obsessed with its secrets are compelled to cause misfortune and woe.": "那些研究Ruidus并沉迷于其秘密的人，被迫造成不幸和灾难。",
	"Plans made or set in motion when Ruidus is full are doomed to failure, often due to betrayal or miscommunication.": "当Ruidus满员时，所做的计划或启动的计划注定要失败，往往是由于背叛或沟通不畅。",
	"The story at the heart of this adventure begins long ago in an age shrouded in myth and legend, as befits an epic {@i Critical Role} tale.": "这场冒险的核心故事开始于很久以前的一个笼罩在神话和传说中的时代，正如一个史诗般的(%0)故事一样。",
	"During the Founding, a time when the gods still walked the face of Exandria, the world's divine creators discovered an unidentifiable power seeping through the fabric of reality. Legends assert that this alien influence was a threat to all life on Exandria, and the gods banded together to banish it.": "在建国时期，当诸神还在艾克桑德里亚的脸上行走时，这个世界的神圣创造者发现了一种无法识别的力量正在渗入现实的结构。传说中，这种外来的影响对艾克桑德里亚的所有生命都是一种威胁，众神联合起来驱逐了它。",
	"This cancerous incursion of dark power is said to have crystallized into Ruidus, the small, vermilion moon that hangs in the sky along with Catha, the world's natural moon. The gods agreed to create a tale about Ruidus to conceal its alien origin from the mortals of the world, informing them that it was a moon of ill omen, and its magical influence was always to be avoided. This tale concocted by the gods was not a lie, for Ruidus's alien magic twists the fate of those who are born or embark on ventures while bathed in its vermilion light.": "这种黑暗力量的癌细胞入侵据说已经结晶为Ruidus，这颗朱红色的小月亮与世界的自然月亮Catha一起挂在天空中。诸神同意创造一个关于Ruidus的故事，向世界上的凡人隐瞒它的异类起源，告诉他们这是一个不祥的月亮，它的魔法影响总是要避免的。众神编造的这个故事并不是谎言，因为Ruidus的外星魔法扭曲了那些在它的朱红色光芒下出生或开始冒险的人的命运。",
	"Some eons later, a schism rocked the pantheon of Exandria, splitting the divine beings into Betrayer Gods and Prime Deities. The Betrayer Gods strove to ruin and dominate the world, and they battled the Prime Deities in a war called the Calamity.": "几个世纪后，一场分裂震撼了埃克桑德里亚的万神殿，使神灵们分裂为背叛者之神和主神。背叛者诸神努力破坏和统治世界，他们在一场名为 \"灾难 \"的战争中与主神交战。",
	"Eventually, the war brought the Apotheon to the great jungle city now known as Cael Morrow, a utopian domain of elves and orcs. These orcs were the first generation of their kind, who had been transformed by the spilled blood of Gruumsh the Ruiner. Although fear had reigned for a short time after the transformation, the two peoples soon realized they were still kin. The city was the jewel of the lush and verdant continent of Marquet, and its people gave thanks daily to Corellon the Arch Heart for their protection.": "最终，战争把阿波提翁带到了现在被称为Cael Morrow的巨大丛林城市，一个由精灵和兽人组成的乌托邦领域。这些兽人是他们的第一代同类，他们被毁灭者格鲁姆什洒下的鲜血改造了。虽然在改造后的短时间内，恐惧笼罩着这两个民族，但他们很快意识到他们仍然是亲属。这座城市是马奎特大陆上郁郁葱葱的宝石，它的人民每天都在感谢大心脏科里隆对他们的保护。",
	"The Ruiner despised the Arch Heart and swore to annihilate Cael Morrow and all of Marquet with a single stroke of his spear. He strode into the center of the city, smiting all who dared raise a blade against him. When he reached the city's heart, Gruumsh raised his spear to strike the earth with cataclysmic force—but his blow was intercepted by the Apotheon at the last possible second.": "毁灭者鄙视拱心，发誓要用他的长矛一举消灭卡奥-莫罗和整个马尔凯。他大步走进城市的中心，痛击所有敢于对他举刀的人。当他到达城市的中心时，格鲁姆什举起他的长矛，以灾难性的力量击打大地--但他的打击在最后一秒被阿波提翁拦截了。",
	"The Apotheon's intervention kept Gruumsh from annihilating all life on Marquet, but the force of his spear thrust still brought the lands of Marquet to ruin. Fire raged across the lush jungle, turning verdant beauty into blasted desert, and Cael Morrow was shunted deep into the earth. Towers toppled, stone crumbled, and all trace of the great civilization was wiped from the face of Exandria.": "阿普特恩的干预使格鲁姆什没有消灭马尔凯特的所有生命，但他的长矛刺入的力量仍然使马尔凯特的土地遭到破坏。火焰在郁郁葱葱的丛林中肆虐，将青翠的美景变成了被炸毁的沙漠，而卡奥-莫罗也被甩到了地底深处。塔楼倒塌，石头碎裂，伟大文明的所有痕迹都从埃克桑德里亚的脸上抹去了。",
	"In that moment of destruction and death, the Apotheon's connection to Ruidus flared to life. A rift was torn between worlds, in which alien energy from an unknown realm and the waters of Cael Morrow's oasis mingled to produce a lightless realm of water and strange magic. There, in what came to be known as the Netherdeep, the Apotheon has been trapped for untold ages, consumed with sadness, furious over his defeat, and yearning for his freedom.": "在那个毁灭和死亡的时刻，阿波提翁与Ruidus的联系被激发出来。世界之间出现了一道裂缝，来自未知领域的外来能量和Cael Morrow绿洲的水混合在一起，产生了一个无光的水和奇怪的魔法领域。在那里，在后来被称为Netherdeep的地方，Apotheon已经被困了无数个时代，被悲伤所吞噬，对他的失败感到愤怒，并渴望着他的自由。",
	"In time, the immortal Apotheon fell into a long and troubled slumber. In his dreams, the barren caverns of the Netherdeep began to shift. His memories filled the darkness, and a cocoon of melancholy formed around his body. From this Heart of Despair emerged a crimson element that embodied the Apotheon's power. It spread, growing and crystallizing as it moved, until all of the Netherdeep was suffused with its power.": "随着时间的推移，不朽的Apotheon陷入了漫长而不安的沉睡。在他的梦中，Netherdeep的贫瘠洞穴开始转变。他的记忆充满了黑暗，他的身体周围形成了一个忧郁的茧。从这个 \"绝望之心 \"中出现了一个深红色的元素，体现了阿波提翁的力量。它蔓延开来，随着它的移动而成长和结晶，直到整个Netherdeep都被它的力量所充斥。",
	"Centuries have passed since the Calamity, and life has returned to the desert lands of Marquet. A grand city called Ank'Harel has been built around a desert oasis. Little did its founders know that the water of their oasis originated in the Netherdeep, and that beneath the new desert metropolis was an underwater cavern holding the ruined city of Cael Morrow.": "灾难过后，几个世纪过去了，马凯的沙漠土地上又恢复了生机。一座名为Ank'Harel的宏伟城市在沙漠绿洲周围建成。城市的创建者们并不知道，他们的绿洲之水源自尼瑟德普，而在这个新的沙漠大都市下面，有一个水下洞穴，里面有废墟般的凯尔莫罗城。",
	"A new form of conflict entered the story when the Allegiance of Allsight, an influential group of academics in Ank'Harel, discovered a strange mineral in the sunken ruins beneath their city. This substance—a slick, oily stone veined with blood-like streaks—possessed unknown magical properties. The Allegiance tried to keep its discovery secret, but the news soon attracted the attention of a rival faction.": "一个新的冲突形式出现在故事中，Allsight联盟，一个在Ank'Harel有影响力的学术团体，在他们城市下面的沉没废墟中发现了一种奇怪的矿物。这种物质是一种光滑的、油性的石头，上面有血一样的条纹，拥有未知的魔法特性。联盟试图对其发现保密，但这一消息很快引起了一个敌对派别的注意。",
	"The Consortium of the Vermilion Dream—a secret occult society obsessed with the magic of the Moon of Ill Omen, Ruidus—heard a rumor about the discovery of this mineral. Consortium agents broke into the Allegiance of Allsight's excavation site in Cael Morrow and learned about the discovery firsthand. They dubbed the mineral \"ruidium,\" because its red veins and its mysteriousness reminded them of the light and power of Ruidus.": "朱雀梦财团--一个痴迷于恶兆之月瑞德斯的魔法的秘密神秘社团--听到了关于发现这种矿物的传言。财团的特工闯入Allsight的Allegiance在Cael Morrow的挖掘现场，亲身了解了这一发现。他们把这种矿物称为 \"Ruidium\"，因为它的红色脉络和它的神秘性让他们想起了Ruidus的光和力量。",
	"The consortium continued sneaking into the excavation, hunting further deposits of the mineral, and discovered a planar rift within the ruins. One of their agents succeeded in getting inside the rift—and when that agent returned, she claimed that she had entered a dark, underwater realm where the walls themselves were veined with ruidium. She managed to recover a sample and escape before the water's intense pressure crushed her body.": "财团继续潜入挖掘现场，寻找更多的矿藏，并在废墟中发现了一个平面裂缝。他们的一名特工成功地进入了裂缝--当这名特工回来时，她声称自己进入了一个黑暗的水下世界，那里的墙壁本身就有Ruidium的纹理。她设法找到了一个样本，并在水的巨大压力将她的身体压碎之前逃脱了。",
	"When that sample of ruidium was torn from the Netherdeep, the shock of the extraction roused the dormant Apotheon from his slumber. All at once, centuries of accumulated grief crashed down upon him, and the Netherdeep roared with the strength of his tempestuous emotions.": "当Ruidium的样本从Netherdeep中被撕开时，提取的冲击将沉睡的Apotheon从他的沉睡中唤醒。一下子，几个世纪以来积累的悲痛向他袭来，Netherdeep因他暴躁的情绪的力量而咆哮。",
	"The power that flows from the Apotheon is no longer truly his own. Try as he might to hang on to the memory of the hero he once was, he is driven entirely by his tortured emotions. Throughout his centuries of isolation, the dormant, dreaming Alyxian had hoped for someone to find and rescue him. But when mortals discovered him, they seemed interested only in stealing his power for themselves. The furious Apotheon tapped into the alien nature of the Netherdeep to cause ruidium to slowly corrupt all who hold it.": "从Apotheon流出的力量不再是真正属于他的。尽管他试图坚持他曾经是英雄的记忆，但他完全被他被折磨的情绪所驱使。在他与世隔绝的几个世纪里，这个休眠的、正在做梦的Alyxian一直希望有人能找到并拯救他。但当凡人发现他时，他们似乎只对为自己窃取他的力量感兴趣。愤怒的Apotheon利用Netherdeep的异样性质，使Ruidium慢慢腐蚀所有持有它的人。",
	"Alyxian beseeched the three gods he had prayed to in ancient times—Sehanine the Moon Weaver, Avandra the Change Bringer, and Corellon the Arch Heart—to send heroes to save him. Despite being sealed behind the Divine Gate, the gods were able to propel the {@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN} to a site where Alyxian once beseeched the Moon Weaver for aid long ago. The jewel materialized within a sunken temple in the Emerald Gulch near Jigow, and the gods hoped that a good-hearted band of heroes would find it, learn of the Apotheon's plight, and rescue their tortured champion. The {@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN} is currently dormant, waiting to be awakened by a determined hero.": "Alyxian恳求他在古代祈祷过的三位神明--织月者Sehanine、改变者Avandra和拱心者Corellon--派英雄来拯救他。尽管被封在神门之后，诸神还是能够将{@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN}推进到阿利仙很久以前曾经向织月者祈求援助的地方。这颗宝石在吉高附近的翡翠谷的一个沉没的神庙里出现，众神希望一帮好心的英雄能找到它，了解阿普特恩的困境，并拯救他们受折磨的冠军。这个{@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN}目前处于休眠状态，等待着被一个坚定的英雄所唤醒。",
	"The first chapter of this adventure begins in Jigow, a Xhorhasian town populated mostly by orcs and goblins brought together by the Kryn Dynasty. Smaller populations of other peoples live among them. Unlike some other Kryn settlements, the people of Jigow have maintained their city's distinctive culture. Jigow's most popular event is the annual Festival of Merit, in which locals and visitors compete in tests of strength and cunning. Rivalries are forged, bets are won and lost, and bragging rights are secured for the year—until the next festival.": "这场冒险的第一章开始于吉高，这是一个霍尔哈斯人的城镇，居民大多是由克里恩王朝带来的兽人和哥布林。其他民族的小部分人口生活在他们中间。与其他一些克莱恩定居点不同的是，吉高人保持了他们城市的独特文化。吉高最受欢迎的活动是一年一度的功绩节，当地人和游客在其中进行力量和狡猾的测试。竞争的结果，赌注的输赢，以及一年的吹嘘权利--直到下一个节日的到来。",

Here, the {@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN} waits to be found. The discovery of this item and a vision in which Alyxian pleads with the characters to save him from his prison of darkness and despair set the adventure in motion.

	"The characters battle for the soul of the Apotheon, with all of Exandria hanging in the balance.": "这些人物为阿普特恩的灵魂而战，整个埃克桑德里亚都悬于一线。",
	"Alyxian is trapped in an extradimensional prison of his own making and longs for freedom. He still has a connection to several holy sites where he received power from the gods during the Calamity, and his consciousness reaches out to certain mortals whose hearts resonate with his own.": "阿利仙被困在他自己制造的维度外监狱中，渴望自由。他与几个圣地仍有联系，在灾变期间，他在那里得到了诸神的力量，他的意识伸向了某些心脏与他自己共鸣的凡人。",
	"Beyond this, Alyxian yearns to be remembered. He is a being composed of little more than memory, sorrow, and hatred. He fears that the world has forgotten his sacrifice entirely—and the Netherdeep has preyed on his selfish urges, instilling in him an obsessive desire to be remembered and idolized by a world that seemingly has forsaken him.": "除此之外，Alyxian还渴望被人记住。他是一个由记忆、悲伤和仇恨组成的生命。他担心这个世界已经完全忘记了他的牺牲--Netherdeep利用了他自私的冲动，向他灌输了一种强迫性的欲望，希望被这个似乎已经抛弃了他的世界所记住和崇拜。",
	"Alyxian appears to the characters several times in visions. The version of himself he shows them is the idealized way he sees himself—someone who has always tried to do good but has been punished nonetheless. The Apotheon is trying to put his best self forward to get what he wants out of the characters. This isn't a false persona, but it isn't the whole picture. In later visions, when the characters are able to speak to Alyxian and ask him questions, probing too deeply can cause the Apotheon to reveal the more raw, selfish parts of himself. These parts of him see the characters as pawns—tools granted to him by the gods.": "Alyxian在幻觉中多次出现在人物面前。他向他们展示的自己的版本是他眼中理想化的方式--一个一直试图做好事但还是受到惩罚的人。阿波提翁试图把自己最好的一面展现出来，以便从这些人物身上得到他想要的东西。这不是一个虚假的角色，但也不是全貌。在后来的幻象中，当人物能够与Alyxian交谈并向他提问时，太深入的探究会导致Apotheon暴露出他自己更原始、更自私的部分。他的这些部分把人物看作是诸神赐予他的棋子和工具。",
	"Ultimately, your job is to try to balance the selfless man that Alyxian once was with the traumatized, manipulative being that he has become. By the end of the adventure, if all goes well, the characters will realize that Alyxian can be redeemed, and that helping him overcome his pain and trauma—thus restoring the hero who once saved Exandria from destruction—is a cause worth fighting for.": "归根结底，你的工作是努力平衡阿利桑曾经的无私和他已经成为的受创伤、被操纵的人。在冒险结束时，如果一切顺利的话，角色们会意识到阿利贤是可以被救赎的，帮助他克服痛苦和创伤--从而恢复那个曾经将埃克桑德里亚从毁灭中拯救出来的英雄--是一项值得为之奋斗的事业。",
	"The events of the adventure should make the characters feel stressed and anxious, but the players should be relaxed and having fun. Before starting the adventure, have a candid conversation with your players about hard and soft limits on what topics can be broached at the table. Your players might have phobias and triggers you aren't aware of; never assume you know your players' deepest fears, no matter how long you've been playing together. Any topic or theme that makes a player feel unsafe should be avoided. If a topic or theme makes one or more players nervous but they give you consent to include it in-game, incorporate it with care. Since D&D adventures aren't heavily scripted, these elements might arise unexpectedly during play. Be prepared to move away from such topics and themes quickly if any player feels uncomfortable.": "冒险的事件应该让角色感到压力和焦虑，但是玩家应该是放松的，并获得乐趣。在开始冒险之前，与你的玩家进行坦诚的对话，讨论哪些话题可以在桌子上讨论的软硬限制。你的玩家可能有你不知道的恐惧症和诱因；无论你们在一起玩了多久，都不要假设你知道你的玩家最深的恐惧。任何让玩家感到不安全的话题或主题都应该避免。如果某个话题或主题让一个或多个玩家感到紧张，但他们同意你在游戏中加入这个话题或主题，那就谨慎地加入吧。由于D&D冒险并没有大量的剧本，这些元素可能会在游戏中意外出现。如果有玩家感到不舒服，请做好准备，迅速远离这些话题和主题。",
	"During this adventure, the characters will explore sunken grottoes, submerged ruins, and an extraplanar aquatic abyss. To run these underwater scenarios in a smooth and fun manner, familiarize yourself with the {@book underwater combat rules|PHB|9|Underwater Combat} in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} as well as the rules below.": "在这次冒险中，角色们将探索沉没的石窟、被淹没的废墟和星外的水生深渊。为了顺利而有趣地运行这些水下场景，请熟悉{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的{@book underwater combat rules|PHB|9|Underwater Combat}以及下面的规则。",

	"Ruidium originates in the Netherdeep. It penetrates and grows into all things it touches. Inanimate objects that become bonded with ruidium are imbued with a sliver of the Apotheon's power. Creatures that interact with ruidium can be physically and emotionally corrupted by it. Their bodies become laced with ruidium veins, and their minds become tormented by the same emotions that haunt the Apotheon.": "Ruidium起源于Netherdeep。它渗透并成长为它所接触的所有事物。与Ruidium结合的无生命物体被灌输了Apotheon的一小部分力量。与Ruidium互动的生物可以在身体和情感上被它腐蚀。他们的身体会变成带有Ruidium的血管，他们的思想会被困扰Apotheon的相同情绪所折磨。",
	"A red rash appears, originating from the point of contact with ruidium.": "出现红色皮疹，起源于与Ruidium的接触点。",
	"Pulsing crimson veins spread across the creature's skin.": "脉动的深红色血管在生物的皮肤上蔓延。",

	"When ruidium corruption ends on a creature, all physical and emotional signs of it disappear from the creature instantly.": "当Ruidium腐败在一个生物身上结束时，所有身体和情绪上的迹象都会从生物身上瞬间消失。",
	"From the beginning, the characters are challenged by a rival adventuring party. This rivalry starts small, with the two groups first meeting while they play games of skill and strength in Jigow. As the rivals make their own way through the adventure, they grow in power and ambition just as the characters do. They are determined to prove that they are the true heroes of this story.": "从一开始，这些人物就受到了敌对的冒险队伍的挑战。这种竞争开始时规模不大，两组人在吉高玩技巧和力量的游戏时第一次见面。随着对手在冒险过程中的发展，他们的力量和野心也在增长，就像角色们一样。他们决心证明自己才是这个故事的真正英雄。",
	"This adventure presents five rivals. Ideally, the number of rivals should be equal to the number of characters in the players' party. If there are fewer than five characters in their party, remove one rival of your choice or give one of them a dramatic death early on. If there are more than five characters in your party, create new rivals. (Maybe one of the rivals has an identical twin.) Alternatively, start with a party of five rivals, and keep an eye out for chances to add new nonplayer characters to the rival party as the characters meet them.": "这次冒险提出了五个对手。理想情况下，对手的数量应该与玩家队伍中的角色数量相等。如果玩家队伍中的人物少于5个，就从你的选择中删除一个对手，或者让他们中的一个在早期就戏剧性地死亡。如果你的队伍中有五个以上的人物，就创造新的对手。(也许其中一个对手有一个同卵双胞胎。)或者，开始时有五个对手，并注意在角色遇到新的非玩家角色时有机会将其加入对手方。",
	"The following descriptions pertain to the rivals at the start of the adventure.": "下面的描述与冒险开始时的对手有关。",
	"As the de facto leader of a new, unnamed adventuring party, Ayo Jabe has a lot of responsibility on her shoulders. She and her companions have worked odd jobs around the town of Jigow for a few weeks now, and she's starting to feel confident that they're ready for real adventure.": "作为一个新的、未命名的冒险队伍的实际领导者，阿尤-贾贝肩上有很多责任。她和她的同伴们在吉高镇周围打零工已经有几个星期了，她开始觉得有信心，他们已经准备好进行真正的冒险。",
	"Ayo is a water genasi who was born to orc parents during a terrible storm in the Emerald Gulch. Her family has lived in Jigow for generations, and she's eager to leave home and see the world.": "阿尤是一个水精灵，在翡翠沟的一场可怕的风暴中由兽人父母所生。她的家族世代居住在吉高，她渴望离开家，看看这个世界。",
	"Ayo picked up her combat skills while working as a hunter for the town of Jigow. She recently joined up with her childhood friend Dermot, as well as Maggie Keeneyes, a mercenary who came to town several weeks ago. Despite Maggie's brusque demeanor, she became a loyal friend of Ayo and Dermot, and the three of them have become inseparable, even as more adventurers have joined their party.": "阿尤在为吉高镇做猎人时学会了战斗技能。她最近与她的童年朋友德莫特以及几周前来到镇上的雇佣兵麦琪-基尼耶斯会合。尽管玛姬举止粗鲁，但她成为了阿尤和德莫特的忠实朋友，他们三人已经变得形影不离，甚至有更多的冒险者加入他们的队伍。",
	"Ayo is hotheaded and appreciates people who make decisions as impulsively as she does. Nevertheless, she respects Dermot's even-tempered advice and dutifully plays the role of the wise leader. She has no patience for people who are indecisive, and she is infuriated by people who don't say what they really mean.": "阿尤是个急性子，欣赏像她一样冲动地做决定的人。尽管如此，她还是尊重德莫特平和的建议，并尽职尽责地扮演着明智的领导者的角色。她对那些优柔寡断的人没有耐心，她对那些不说真话的人感到愤怒。",
	"When you're the twelfth son of a poor goblin family in Jigow, the only way to make a name for yourself is to become a great champion—someone who can win bragging contests in the local taverns night after night. Young Dermot Wurder, however, wasn't interested in performing feats of strength or agility that would win him a boast-worthy epithet. Fame wasn't for him, nor was the aggressiveness that becoming famous required. He was more interested in cooking, planting flowers, and sewing clothes—doing the work that kept his family together while his carefree siblings dove off waterfalls and wrestled stray dogs.": "当你是吉高一个贫穷的妖精家庭的第十二个儿子时，为自己扬名立万的唯一途径是成为一个伟大的冠军--一个能在当地酒馆里夜夜赢得吹嘘的人。然而，年轻的德莫特-沃尔德对表演力量或敏捷性的壮举不感兴趣，这将为他赢得一个值得夸耀的外号。名声对他来说并不重要，成名所需的进取心也不重要。他更感兴趣的是做饭、种花和缝衣服--当他无忧无虑的兄弟姐妹从瀑布上跳下来和与流浪狗搏斗时，他做的工作使他的家庭团结一致。",
	"Dermot and Ayo Jabe have known each other long enough that their first meeting has vanished into the haze of youthful pre-memory. Dermot accompanied Ayo whenever he could, packing herbs and medicines when they went exploring in the woods. When Ayo recently told him of her dream to form an adventuring party, he started training to wear heavy armor and threw himself into studying the faith of the Luxon so he could wield the blessings of the light to protect those he cares about.": "德莫特和阿约-贾贝相识已久，他们的第一次见面已经消失在青春前的记忆的阴霾中。只要有机会，德莫特就会陪伴阿尤，当他们去森林探险时，他会带上草药和药品。当阿尤最近告诉他她的梦想是组建一支冒险队伍时，他开始训练穿上重甲，并投入到研究卢克逊人的信仰中，以便他能挥舞光明的祝福，保护他所关心的人。",
	"Dermot is fiercely protective of his friends and furiously rebukes anyone who disparages or threatens them. His deepest need—one even he doesn't know he has—is to make a friend who will help him realize what he wants for himself.": "德莫特激烈地保护他的朋友，并愤怒地斥责任何贬低或威胁他们的人。他最深的需求--连他自己都不知道--是结交一个能帮助他实现自己愿望的朋友。",
	"Beautiful, ethereal, deathly, shadowy—all accurately describe Galsariad Ardyth, a drow in his two-hundredth year of life. He's recently taken up the study of arcane magic, and he's pursuing the life of an adventurer in hopes of improving his reputation within the Kryn Dynasty. Loquacious, snarky, and sarcastic to a fault, he's ready with a barb for any occasion—usually to mask his own insecurities.": "美丽的、空灵的、死亡的、阴暗的--所有这些都准确地描述了Galsariad Ardyth，一个生命中两百岁的乌鸦。他最近开始学习神秘的魔法，并追求冒险家的生活，希望能提高他在克莱恩王朝的声誉。他健谈、尖刻、讽刺，在任何场合都准备好了尖锐的言辞--通常是为了掩饰自己的不安全感。",
	"A city-dweller from the Kryn capital of Rosohna, Galsariad is blessed with sharp aesthetic sensibilities and an interest in ancient lore, especially history concerning the Age of Arcanum, Exandria's long-lost magical golden age. He's also the newest member of the rival party, and both Ayo and Irvan are impressed by his ethereal elegance—and have a bit of a crush on him, even if he does talk too much.": "来自克里恩首都罗索纳的城市居民，加尔萨里德拥有敏锐的审美感觉和对古代传说的兴趣，特别是关于阿卡努姆时代的历史，艾克桑德里亚久违的魔法黄金时代。他也是敌对党的最新成员，阿尤和伊万都对他的空灵优雅印象深刻--并且对他有点好感，尽管他确实说得太多了。",
	"Galsariad appreciates people who share his interests and are willing to spend time studying with him, though he also likes it when people treat him with respect even if they don't care about magic. He dislikes people who keep secrets from him, and hates when people judge him for being a novice at magic even though he's centuries old.": "Galsariad欣赏那些与他志趣相投、愿意花时间和他一起学习的人，不过他也喜欢人们对他的尊重，即使他们并不关心魔法。他不喜欢那些对他保密的人，也讨厌人们评判他是个魔法新手，尽管他已经有几个世纪的历史。",
	"The name \"Wastewalker\" conjures fear on the plains of Xhorhas, as the name of a clan of Xhorhasian nomads. Irvan—Irv to his friends—was born into that clan, but he hates the name. He left his family when he was a teenager, struck out on his own across the wastes, and made his way to the city of Asarius. Even though the \"City of Beasts\" is renowned for danger, Irv felt at home there in a way he'd never felt with his clan.": "\"Wastewalker \"这个名字在Xhorhas平原上引起了恐惧，这是Xhorhasian游牧民族的一个部族的名字。Irvan-Irv是他的朋友，他出生在那个部族，但他讨厌这个名字。他在十几岁的时候就离开了他的家庭，独自一人穿越荒野，来到了阿萨留斯城。尽管 \"野兽之城 \"以危险而闻名，但艾弗在那里有一种家的感觉，这是他在他的家族中从未感受到的。",
	"He earned a reputation for being a party animal who could put down a dozen drinks in a night and still dance with the vigor and elegance of an archfey. Irv is young—just a few weeks past his nineteenth birthday—and he is secretly ashamed of his patchy beard and scrawny, human body. He has a bigger secret related to that feeling: he was consecuted in another life. The act of consecution is a sacred Kryn ritual of rebirth through the mystical power of the Luxon. Irvan has memories of his previous life as a bugbear of Den Hythenos, and he hopes to prove to himself that he can do great things without the aid of his powerful \"family\" in the Kryn Dynasty.": "他因是一个派对动物而赢得了声誉，他可以在一个晚上喝下一打酒，而且还能像大法官那样充满活力和优雅地跳舞。欧文很年轻--他的19岁生日刚过几个星期--他暗自为自己斑驳的胡子和瘦弱的人形身体感到羞愧。他有一个与这种感觉有关的更大的秘密：他在前世被迫害过。迫害行为是克莱恩的一种神圣仪式，通过卢克松的神秘力量重生。欧文有他前世作为登赫特诺斯的虫子的记忆，他希望向自己证明，没有他在克里恩王朝强大的 \"家族 \"的帮助，他也能做伟大的事情。",
	"He met Ayo and her friends when he traveled to Jigow to experience its contests of strength and skill. He sticks with the group in part because he's interested in what adventures they'll get into, and also because he's smitten with the group's newest addition, a drow arcanist named Galsariad.": "他在前往吉高体验力量和技巧的竞赛时遇到了阿尤和她的朋友。他坚持和这个团体在一起，部分原因是他对他们会有什么冒险感兴趣，也因为他对这个团体的最新成员--一个名叫加尔萨里德的鸦人奥术师--很感兴趣。",
	"People might laugh when a 12-foot-tall ogre orders a drink at a bar and says her name is Maggie, but they don't laugh for long. Some people fixate on her name, her enormous size, her muscles, or the weapon at her side. Wiser folk take notice of Maggie's bright blue eyes. All her life, people have considered Maggie a stupid meathead because of her size, but her eyes betray her intelligence. She can read others with a glance, whether in conversation or in a duel. When her eyes dart back and forth across a battlefield, they take in enough information to give her allies an advantage in the fight.": "当一个12英尺高的食人魔在酒吧点了一杯饮料并说她的名字叫麦琪时，人们可能会笑，但他们不会笑很久。有些人专注于她的名字，她巨大的体型，她的肌肉，或她身边的武器。更聪明的人则注意到麦琪明亮的蓝眼睛。在她的一生中，人们都认为麦琪是一个愚蠢的肉头，因为她的体型，但她的眼睛出卖了她的智慧。不管是在谈话中还是在决斗中，她都能一眼看透别人。当她的眼睛在战场上来回逡巡时，会吸收足够的信息，使她的盟友在战斗中获得优势。",
	"Things changed for Maggie when she first arrived in Jigow and met Ayo Jabe three weeks ago. She came looking for mercenary work to make ends meet but found a true friend instead. Ayo saw the intelligence in Maggie's eyes and was keen to hear Maggie's thoughts. They became fast friends, and Maggie would sooner die than let harm come to her new companion.": "三个星期前，麦琪第一次来到吉哥，遇到了阿尤-贾贝，事情就发生了变化。她是来寻找雇佣兵工作以维持生计的，但却发现了一个真正的朋友。阿约从麦琪的眼中看到了智慧，并热衷于倾听麦琪的想法。他们很快成为朋友，麦琪宁愿死也不愿让她的新伙伴受到伤害。",
	"Maggie loves poetry and music with profound lyrics, as well as matching wits with people as clever as she is. She hates being stereotyped and has a dim view of those who are too quick to judge others.": "麦琪喜欢诗歌和歌词深刻的音乐，也喜欢与像她一样聪明的人比拼智慧。她讨厌被定型，并对那些过于急于评判他人的人看法模糊。",
	"Each rival has goals. As the characters interact with the rivals, they might choose to help the rivals achieve their goals or use their own knowledge of those goals to manipulate the rivals into doing what they want. A Charisma check to ask for help (see \"{@area Asking for Help|031|x}\" below) is made with advantage if the rival thinks agreeing to the character's request will help achieve the rivals' goals and is made with disadvantage if it goes directly against the rivals' goals.": "每个对手都有目标。当角色与对手互动时，他们可能会选择帮助对手实现他们的目标，或者利用自己对这些目标的了解来操纵对手做他们想要的事情。如果对手认为同意人物的请求会有助于实现对手的目标，那么就可以通过魅力检查来寻求帮助（见下面的\"{@area Asking for Help|031|x}\"）；如果直接与对手的目标相违背，就会产生不利影响。",
	"The Rivals' Goals table summarizes each rival's goals at the start of this adventure. Some of them are broadly applicable and might never be definitively achieved. Others are highly specific (such as Galsariad's goal to match wits with an archmage). The rivals can acquire new goals as the adventure progresses, as you see fit.": "敌对者的目标表总结了每个敌对者在这次冒险开始时的目标。其中有些目标是广泛适用的，可能永远也无法明确地实现。其他的则是非常具体的（比如Galsariad的目标是与大法师比拼智慧）。随着冒险的进展，对手可以获得新的目标，只要你认为合适。",
	"Ayo Jabe": "Ayo Jabe",
	"Become a hero like the ones she has read about in stories; make a friend she can be truly herself around; kill a legendary monster": "成为像她在故事中读到的那样的英雄；交一个可以在她身边真正做自己的朋友；杀一个传说中的怪物。",
	"Dermot Wurder": "Dermot Wurder",
	"Protect his friends; have a life-changing holy vision; discover that he has value himself, not just as someone who can help others": "保护他的朋友；有一个改变生活的圣洁愿景；发现他自己有价值，而不仅仅是可以帮助别人的人。",

	"Stat blocks for the rivals can be found in {@adventure appendix A|CRCotN|8}. Each of the rivals has three stat blocks; like the characters, they become more powerful as the adventure progresses. The Rival Stat Blocks table shows you which stat blocks to use based on the chapter you are running.": "竞争对手的状态块可以在{@adventure appendix A|CRCotN|8}找到。每个对手都有三个状态块；和角色一样，随着冒险的进行，他们会变得更加强大。竞争对手的状态块表显示了根据你正在运行的章节使用哪些状态块。",
	"When the characters meet the rivals in {@adventure chapter 1|CRCotN|1}, all the rivals have an indifferent attitude toward them. It's up to you to determine when a rival's attitude toward a character might change. For example, after a combat encounter in which one character saves a rival's life or helps a rival achieve one of their goals (see the {@area Rivals' Goals table|02c|x}), you can decide if that deed enabled the rival to see the character in a new light, changing the rival's attitude toward the character from hostile to indifferent or indifferent to friendly. The {@book rules for changing attitude|DMG|8|Resolving Interactions} are detailed in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}.": "当人物在{@adventure chapter 1|CRCotN|1}中遇到对手时，所有的对手都对他们抱有冷漠的态度。由你来决定对手对某个角色的态度何时可能改变。例如，在一次战斗中，一个角色救了对手的命，或者帮助对手实现了他们的一个目标（见{@area Rivals' Goals table|02c|x}），你可以决定这个行为是否使对手对这个角色有了新的看法，使对手对这个角色的态度从敌视变为冷漠，或者从冷漠变为友好。{@book rules for changing attitude|DMG|8|Resolving Interactions}详见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}。",
	"Since every rival's attitude toward the characters starts out as indifferent, it's important to note only the hostile and friendly relationships that blossom between the two parties and the reasons why the relationship became friendly or hostile.": "由于每个对手对人物的态度一开始都是冷漠的，所以只需要注意双方之间的敌对和友好关系，以及关系变得友好或敌对的原因。",
	"You can decide that certain actions—such as a character killing one of the rivals—automatically turn all the rivals hostile against all the characters. The converse isn't true; singular acts of kindness toward an individual rival aren't as likely to make all the rivals friendly toward all the characters.": "你可以决定某些行为--比如一个角色杀死一个对手--会自动使所有的对手对所有的角色产生敌意。反之亦然；对个别对手的单一善意行为并不可能使所有对手对所有角色都友好。",
	"{@i Critical Role} stories are known for their rich cast of characters. The characters created by the players are the protagonists of this story.

	"Nevertheless, these other participants are of crucial importance. They exist to goad the heroes into making reckless decisions, to prey on their flaws, to spur the story forward when it stalls, and to enhance the mysteries of the world.": "然而，这些其他参与者具有至关重要的意义。他们的存在是为了诱导英雄们做出鲁莽的决定，利用他们的缺陷，在故事停滞不前时刺激其前进，并增强世界的神秘性。",
	"At times, the characters might want help from one or more rivals to accomplish their goals. Any character who requests help from a rival must make a successful Charisma check to convince that rival to help them. Consider that rival's relationship to the character in question, then consult the {@book Conversation Reaction|DMG|8|Conversation Reaction} table in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to determine the DC of the check and the rival's reaction to the character's request.": "有时，人物可能希望得到一个或多个对手的帮助来完成他们的目标。任何请求对手帮助的角色都必须进行成功的魅力检查，以说服该对手帮助他们。考虑该对手与该角色的关系，然后参考{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的{@book Conversation Reaction|DMG|8|Conversation Reaction}表，以确定检定的DC以及该对手对该角色请求的反应。",

	"This adventure begins in Xhorhas, where most humans are nomads; most elves are drow who live aboveground; dwarves and halflings are rare; and goblinoids, orcs, lizardfolk, kobolds, and other creatures sometimes seen as \"monstrous\" elsewhere are more populous than gnomes and dragonborn. Whether the characters are natives of Xhorhas or outsiders, assume they are aware of what's said in the \"{@area What the Characters Know|037|x}\" section below.": "这个冒险开始于Xhorhas，在那里大多数人类是游牧民族；大多数精灵是生活在地面上的乌鸦；矮人和半身人很少；地精、兽人、蜥蜴人、哥布林和其他有时在其他地方被视为 \"畸形 \"的生物比地精和龙裔更多。无论人物是Xhorhas的本地人还是外来者，都要假定他们知道下面\"{@area What the Characters Know|037|x} \"部分所说的内容。",
	"Before starting the adventure, consider spending a game session—colloquially called session zero—to establish expectations, share house rules, and help your players create characters. If you have a copy of {@book Tasha's Cauldron of Everything|TCE}, see that book's \"{@book Session Zero|TCE|4|Session Zero}\" section for advice on how to lay the groundwork in session zero for a fun campaign that exceeds your players' expectations.": "在开始冒险之前，考虑花一个游戏环节--俗称零环节--来建立期望，分享内部规则，并帮助你的玩家创建角色。如果你有一本《{@book Tasha's Cauldron of Everything|TCE}》，请参阅该书的\"{@book Session Zero|TCE|4|Session Zero} \"部分，了解如何在零会话中打下基础，以开展超出玩家期望的有趣活动。",
	"Additional race options appear in {@book Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}, with bugbear, duergar, goblin, hobgoblin, kobold, lizardfolk, minotaur, and orc being appropriate choices for players who want their characters to come from cultures or societies with roots in Xhorhas.": "额外的种族选项出现在{@book Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}中，对于那些希望自己的角色来自与Xhorhas有渊源的文化或社会的玩家来说，虫人、duergar、地精、hobgoblin、kobold、蜥蜴人、牛头人和兽人是合适的选择。",
	"All class options presented in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} can be used in this adventure, and players can choose options from other D&D books with your approval.": "{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中介绍的所有等级选项都可以在这个冒险中使用，玩家可以在你的同意下从其他D&D书籍中选择选项。",
	"Dungeon Masters are fallible, just like everyone else, and even the most experienced DMs make mistakes. If you overlook, forget, or misrepresent something, correct yourself and move on.

As long as your players are having fun, everything will be just fine.": "地下城管理员是易变的，就像其他人一样，而且即使是最有经验的管理员也会犯错。如果你忽略了什么，忘记了什么，或者错误地描述了什么，请纠正自己并继续前进。这是一个有很多相互联系的元素的大冒险；没有人期望你把它的每个方面都内化或记住。只要你的玩家玩得开心，一切都会好起来的。",
	"The beginning of this adventure assumes the characters are familiar with each other. Are they using Jigow as a rest stop on their way elsewhere, are they residents of Jigow, or some combination of the two?": "这场冒险的开始是假设角色们彼此都很熟悉。他们是在其他地方的路上把吉哥作为休息站，还是吉哥的居民，或者两者的某种组合？",
	"If the players are unfamiliar with Exandria and the lands of Xhorhas, they might find it daunting to create a back story set in this world. If you have {@book Explorer's Guide to Wildemount|EGW}, the {@book Heroic Chronicle|EGW|5|Heroic Chronicle} section in that book roots a character's history in the lands of Wildemount by helping the player determine their character's birth nation, home settlement, and relationships with family members, allies, and enemies. It also helps establish major events that happened to the character before the campaign began.": "如果玩家对艾克桑德里亚和Xhorhas的土地不熟悉，他们可能会发现在这个世界上创造一个背景故事是很困难的。如果你有{@book Explorer's Guide to Wildemount|EGW}，该书中的{@book Heroic Chronicle|EGW|5|Heroic Chronicle}部分会帮助玩家确定角色的出生国、家乡定居点以及与家庭成员、盟友和敌人的关系，从而使角色的历史扎根于怀德蒙的土地。它还有助于确定在活动开始之前发生在角色身上的重大事件。",
	"Regardless of whether you use that information, asking the players the following questions about their characters can help them come up with a strong back story:": "无论你是否使用这些信息，向玩家询问关于他们角色的以下问题可以帮助他们想出一个强有力的背景故事。",

	"The Kryn Dynasty is the dominant nation in Xhorhas. It was founded by a drow queen named Leylas Kryn, who fled the Underdark and the tyrannical rule of Lolth the Spider Queen along with her disciples. The Bright Queen still rules the dynasty centuries later, and its cities contain more than just drow. Orcs, goblinoids, tieflings, humans, and many others call the cities of the dynasty their home. Countless more denizens of the dynasty are nomads who roam the wastes in clans, hunting mastodons and other Xhorhasian megafauna.": "克林王朝是Xhorhas的主导国家。它是由一位名叫莱伊拉斯-克莱恩（Leylas Kryn）的乌鸦女王建立的，她和她的弟子们一起逃离了暗黑世界和蜘蛛女王洛尔思的暴政。几个世纪后，光明女王仍然统治着这个王朝，而它的城市里不仅仅有乌鸦。兽人、地精、铁弗林、人类和其他许多人都把这个王朝的城市当作他们的家。王朝还有无数的居民是游牧民族，他们以部落的形式在荒原上游荡，猎杀乳齿象和其他Xhorhasian巨型动物。",
	"This coastal settlement is actually a string of villages that are home to a collection of folk from all over Xhorhas. Goblin and orc clans founded Jigow, which explains why the settlement is governed by two elders—a goblin and an orc. The Aurora Watch (the military arm of the Kryn Dynasty) maintains a presence here, under the command of a drow called Taskhand Durth Mirimm.": "这个沿海定居点实际上是一连串的村庄，是来自Xhorhas各地的居民的家。地精和兽人氏族建立了吉高，这也解释了为什么这个定居点由两位长老管理--一位地精和一位兽人。曙光守望（Kryn王朝的军事部门）在这里保持着存在，由一个叫Taskhand Durth Mirimm的乌鸦指挥。",
	"Townsfolk tend to be competitive, and friendly rivalries are commonplace. Most of Jigow's residents live in a central region called the Jumble.": "镇民们倾向于竞争，友好的竞争是很常见的。大多数吉高的居民都住在一个叫做 \"Jumble \"的中心区域。",
	"The official deity of the Kryn Dynasty, whose symbol appears on the nation's heraldry, is the Luxon. This mysterious divine entity of light and rebirth has granted its faithful several esoteric secrets, the greatest of which is consecution—the act of preparing one's soul for rebirth. Through consecution, some people within the Kryn Dynasty have lived many lifetimes, often in bodies different from the ones they were first born in. In the sequence of consecution, a drow might become a goblin, then be reborn as a bugbear, then an orc, and so on—all the while gaining greater knowledge about the world through their experiences. This process has no mechanical benefit, but players can make consecution and rebirth an interesting part of their characters' back stories.": "克林王朝的官方神灵是卢克松，其标志出现在国家的纹章上。这个神秘的光明和重生的神灵赋予其信徒一些神秘的秘密，其中最大的秘密是迫害--为重生准备灵魂的行为。通过迫害，克莱恩王朝的一些人已经活了很多世，往往是在与他们第一次出生时不同的身体中。在迫害的顺序中，一个鸦人可能会变成妖精，然后转生为虫人，然后是兽人，等等，同时通过他们的经历获得对世界的更多知识。这个过程没有任何机械上的好处，但玩家可以让迫害和重生成为他们角色背景故事中有趣的一部分。",
	"If a follower of the Luxon who has undergone the ritual of consecution dies within 100 miles of a Luxon beacon, their soul is ensnared by it and reincarnated within the body of a random Humanoid newborn within 100 miles of the beacon.": "如果一个经历过迫害仪式的卢克逊信徒在卢克逊信标100英里范围内死亡，他们的灵魂会被信标俘虏，并在信标100英里范围内随机转世到一个人形新生儿的体内。",

	"The characters are in Jigow during the city's annual Festival of Merit. Though they are the protagonists of this story, today they are but a small handful of excited festivalgoers amid a merry throng. Many of the Xhorhasians present are famed warriors, skilled athletes, cunning con artists, and talented arcanists. Among those taking part in the festivities are the characters' rivals, another group of adventurers whose fates are entwined with the characters.": "这些人物是在吉哥市一年一度的功德节期间出现的。虽然他们是这个故事的主角，但今天他们只是欢乐的人群中的一小撮兴奋的节日参与者。在场的许多霍哈斯人都是著名的战士、熟练的运动员、狡猾的骗子和天才的奥术师。参加庆典的人中有人物的对手，另一群冒险家，他们的命运与人物纠缠在一起。",

These suggestions will help you develop the relationships between the rivals and the characters. The evolution of a fierce rivalry into a friendship—or even a romance—is an exciting way to enhance the ongoing story of this adventure. Conversely, a friendship crumbling because of a breakdown in communication or a clash of two unbending ideals is a tragedy that echoes the darker tones of this adventure.": "在本章中，每当有对手出现的时候，\"对手印象 \"部分就会解释这个人可能对人物的行为做出的反应。这些建议将帮助你发展对手和人物之间的关系。激烈的竞争演变为友谊--甚至是恋情--是一种令人兴奋的方式，可以增强这个冒险故事的持续性。相反，由于沟通的中断或两个不坚定的理想的冲突而导致的友谊崩溃是一个悲剧，与这个冒险的黑暗色调相呼应。",

	"Jigow is located in northern Xhorhas on the banks of the Emerald Gulch and the Ifolon River. An amalgamation of coastal villages that were originally settled by several nomadic clans of orcs and goblins, Jigow is now home to humans and other folk as well, and the city gained a significant drow population after Jigow became a part of the Kryn Dynasty.": "吉高位于Xhorhas北部的翡翠沟和伊福隆河畔。吉高是一个沿海村庄的综合体，最初由几个兽人和地精的游牧部族定居，现在吉高也是人类和其他民俗的家园，在吉高成为克里恩王朝的一部分后，这个城市获得了大量的鸦人人口。",
	"The villages and townships that make up Jigow are loosely divided into three major areas: the Meatwaters, the main dock area on the shores of the Ifolon River; the Wetwalks, a collection of houses on stilts closest to the wetlands and marshes; and the Jumble, the most densely populated region of the city, where houses are built among giant mangrove trees or on the backs of horizonback tortoises and used as traveling homes.": "组成吉高的村庄和乡镇被松散地分为三大区域：Meatwaters，伊佛龙河岸边的主要码头区；Wetwalks，最靠近湿地和沼泽地的高跷房屋集合；Jumble，城市中人口最密集的区域，房屋建在巨大的红树林间或地平线上的乌龟背上，作为旅行的住所。",
	"The Jumble is the heart of Jigow and home to a colorful patchwork of local cultures. The traditions of ancient Xhorhasian peoples, many of them orcs and goblins, live on in the peaceful chaos of the Jumble. The twisting, unplanned streets give the district its name—a medley of homes, shops, workshops, athletic fields, amphitheaters, shrines, taverns, stables, and public spaces for lively gatherings.": "大杂烩是吉高的心脏，也是当地文化五彩斑斓的家园。古代Xhorhasian民族的传统，其中许多是兽人和地精，在Jumble的和平混乱中继续生存。曲折的、没有规划的街道使该区得名--由住宅、商店、工场、运动场、露天剧场、神殿、酒馆、马厩和用于热闹聚会的公共空间组成。",
	"Jigow was built from the sweat of its founders' brows, the strength of their muscles, and the music of their voices. In Jigow, any chance to show off one's physical, social, or intellectual prowess is a welcome one, and there's no opportunity better than the annual festival. On this day, friendly and not-so-friendly contests between residents are settled. Every public space is filled with festival games, food stalls, or other amenities for the merrymakers, and plenty of shops and private residences have flung their doors wide to join in the revelry.": "吉高是由其创始人的眉毛的汗水、肌肉的力量和声音的音乐建立的。在吉高，任何展示自己身体、社交或智力的机会都是值得欢迎的，而没有什么机会比一年一度的节日更好了。在这一天，居民之间的友好和不友好的竞赛都会得到解决。每个公共场所都摆满了节日游戏、食品摊位或其他供欢庆者使用的设施，大量的商店和私人住宅也敞开大门，加入到狂欢中。",
	"This story begins as the characters enter the Jumble. Read or paraphrase the boxed text below to set the scene:": "这个故事从人物进入Jumble时开始。阅读或转述下面的方框内的文字来设定场景。",
	"You have entered the Jumble, a large district of tangled roads and single-story buildings in the town of Jigow. Throngs of people, most of them orcs and goblins, move through the streets, laughing, singing, running, and sightseeing. All are enthralled by the raucous sights and sounds of the town's Festival of Merit.": "你已经进入了 \"混乱\"，这是吉高镇的一个由纠结的道路和单层建筑组成的大区。成群结队的人，其中大部分是兽人和地精，在街道上穿梭，欢笑、歌唱、奔跑和观光。所有人都被镇上功德节的喧闹景象和声音迷住了。",
	"You hear snippets of conversations as people pass by: a goblin mother telling her children not to go near the baby horizonback tortoises, a drow guard in shining insectile armor complaining to his partner that his gauntlet was crushed by a hulking orc while arm-wrestling, and a pair of young orcs in swimwear hollering as they rush toward the banks of the Ifolon River.": "你听到人们经过时的对话片段：一个地精母亲告诉她的孩子不要靠近小角背龟，一个穿着闪亮的昆虫盔甲的乌鸦卫士向他的伙伴抱怨他的铠甲在掰手腕时被一个巨大的兽人捏碎了，还有一对穿着泳装的年轻兽人一边叫喊一边冲向伊佛隆河岸。",
	"All around you, colorful signs and banners point toward festival booths surrounded by cheering people. On this street alone, you can see a meat-pie eating contest near a shop mounted on the back of a massive tortoise, and on the other side of the road, a banner emblazoned with the words \"Riddles and Rhymes: Unbeatable Riddles!\" That banner points toward a three-story temple in the center of the Jumble. The town is yours to explore—where do you want to go?": "在你的周围，五颜六色的标志和横幅指向节日的摊位，周围是欢呼的人群。仅仅在这条街上，你就可以看到一家装在巨大乌龟背上的商店附近的吃肉馅饼比赛，而在路的另一边，有一条横幅，上面写着 \"谜语和韵律。无与伦比的谜语！\" 这条横幅指向 \"大杂烩 \"中心的一座三层楼的寺庙。这个小镇由你来探索，你想去哪里？",

	"A maze has been constructed in the Jumble. Competitors win a prize if they navigate the maze in one try without coming upon a dead end.": "在Jumble里建了一个迷宫。参赛者如果能在一次尝试中走完迷宫而不走到死胡同，就可以赢得奖品。",
	"Some distance offshore in the Ifolon River, a rusted spear is lodged into a weathered piece of a pier that has long since rotted away. It is a popular spot for Jigow's most talented swimmers to test their speed and skill.": "在离伊福隆河不远的地方，一根生锈的长矛插在一块早已腐烂的码头上，风化得很厉害。这里是吉哥最有天赋的游泳者测试其速度和技巧的热门地点。",
	"One of the Aurora Watch soldiers stationed in Jigow has challenged anyone and everyone to best her in an arm-wrestling contest. So far, she remains undefeated.": "驻扎在吉哥的一名曙光守望者士兵向任何人和所有人发出挑战，要在掰手腕比赛中打败她。到目前为止，她仍然是不败之身。",
	"Members of the Gakthash and Uvuroh goblin clans time their rice paddy harvests to coincide with the Festival of Merit every year. This event turns the mundane act of harvesting into a spirited competition.": "Gakthash和Uvuroh妖精部族的成员每年都会在功德节期间收割稻谷。这一活动将收割这一平凡的行为变成了一场激烈的竞争。",
	"This year's brood of young horizonback tortoises must be relocated from the Wetwalks to the Jumble.": "今年的一窝小地平线陆龟必须从Wetwalks迁移到Jumble。",

	"The characters might want to look for a particular type of game: a contest of athleticism, a test of puzzle-solving, or a trial of endurance.

	"A character who inspects the keys can see that each is made of a different metal—one bronze, one copper, one silver, and one gold. Close examination of the box reveals that its lock is shaped like a dragon with a fluted crest, and the edges of the box are decorated with engravings of pearls and shells.": "检查钥匙的人可以看到，每把钥匙都是由不同的金属制成的--一把青铜，一把铜，一把银，一把金。仔细检查盒子可以发现，它的锁的形状像一条有凹槽的龙，盒子的边缘有珍珠和贝壳的雕刻装饰。",
	"The lock's shape and sea-themed decorations are clues that suggest a bronze dragon—and thus, it's the bronze key that opens the lock.

Bottle 5, containing the glow potion, is the correct bottle.": "一个角色必须喝下正确的瓶子才能获胜，任何尝试挑战的人只有两次机会猜对。如果有人猜错了两次，他们就不能通过这个谜语。装有发光药水的5号瓶是正确的瓶子。",
	"A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence check comes to one of the following conclusions:": "一个角色如果在DC12智力检查中成功，会得出以下结论之一。",
	"Bottles 2 and 6 are both directly to the right of a purple bottle and thus must contain blight brew.": "2号瓶和6号瓶都在一个紫色瓶子的右边，因此必须含有枯萎酒。",
	"Bottles 2, 4, and 6—the \"even\" ones—should be avoided, as they hold only \"pain.\"": "应避免使用第2、4和6瓶--\"偶数 \"瓶，因为它们只装 \"痛苦\"。",

	"Unless the characters solve each riddle on the first try, Galsariad brusquely brushes past them, chuckling, \"Better luck next time.\" Nonetheless, he is impressed by characters who display a ruthless drive to succeed.

As a consolation prize, he offers them rooms at the Unbroken Tusk inn for the night, free of charge.": "当乡亲们围着对手转的时候，乌斯鲁长老走近了这些人物。虽然他们输掉了比赛，但长老向他们保证，他选择他们这组人参加比赛是有原因的--真正的功绩不是在一天之内就能证明的，而是在一个人的一生中，一次一个小的行为。作为安慰奖，他为他们提供了在 \"未断的獠牙 \"旅馆过夜的免费房间。",

	"The gloomstalker shrieks as it descends upon a mammoth with claws bared, but its attacks have little effect. Frustrated, it ascends into the sky and spots the party. The gloomstalker lets out another shriek as it flies toward the characters, eager to feast on their flesh.

	"If you think a rival has a chance to achieve one of their goals (see the {@area Rivals' Goals table|02c|x} in the {@adventure introduction|CRCotN|0}), this is an opportunity for them to try to achieve that goal. For example, Maggie, who wants to spar with a tactical genius, might invite a character to take a seat at her Dragonchess board and have a game. While they play, she makes conversation about battle tactics—how she prefers to gang up on foes and overwhelm them, rather than engaging in a fair fight, since, in her words, \"People who fight fair don't win fights.\" Determine the winner of the game by having each participant make an Intelligence check at the end of the conversation, with victory going to whoever rolls the highest.": "如果你认为对手有机会实现他们的某个目标（见{@adventure introduction|CRCotN|0}中的{@area Rivals' Goals table|02c|x}），这就是他们尝试实现这个目标的机会。例如，想和一个战术天才切磋的麦琪，可能会邀请一个角色在她的龙门棋盘前坐一坐，来一局。当他们玩的时候，她会谈论战斗策略--她更喜欢群殴敌人并压倒他们，而不是进行公平的战斗，因为用她的话说，\"公平战斗的人不会赢得战斗。\" 在谈话结束时，让每个参与者进行智力检查，谁的分数最高，谁就获胜，以此来决定游戏的赢家。",

	"Because the characters can go anywhere in town, it's important for you to read both the \"{@area Bazzoxan Overview|0ed|x}\" and \"{@area Locations in Bazzoxan|0f2|x}\" sections to familiarize yourself with the town before running this chapter.": "因为人物可以去镇上的任何地方，所以在运行本章之前，你必须阅读\"{@area Bazzoxan Overview|0ed|x} \"和\"{@area Locations in Bazzoxan|0f2|x} \"两部分，以熟悉镇上的情况。",
	"If the characters get stuck or frustrated, you can use friendly nonplayer characters such as {@creature Verin Thelyss|CRCotN} and the faction agents to give them hints about how they could learn more. Ultimately, the characters need to find the prayer site inside the Betrayers' Rise.": "如果角色们被卡住或感到沮丧，你可以利用友好的非玩家角色，如{@creature Verin Thelyss|CRCotN}和派系代理人，给他们提示如何能了解更多。最终，人物需要找到背叛者崛起里面的祈祷场所。",
	"The path to the prayer site can be opened only by using the {@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN}. Doing so allows access to a segment of the Betrayers' Rise that has never been explored by the Aurora Watch. If the characters don't have the jewel, they might need to take it from the rivals—by stealth, by force, or by barter—as described in {@area area B7|116|x}, later in the chapter.": "只有通过使用{@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN}才能打开通往祈祷场所的道路。这样做可以进入 \"背叛者的崛起 \"中从未被极光守卫探索过的部分。如果人物没有珠宝，他们可能需要通过隐蔽、武力或以物易物的方式从对手那里得到它--如本章后面的{@area area B7|116|x}中所述。",
	"In addition, the final confrontation in this chapter is a duel for the possession of the jewel. Regardless of whether the rivals or the characters end up with the jewel, the adventure continues on the far-off continent of Marquet. The \"{@area Next Steps|171|x}\" section of the chapter explains how to transition the characters from Bazzoxan to their new location.": "此外，本章的最后一次对抗是为争夺宝石的所有权而进行的决斗。不管是对手还是角色最终得到了宝石，冒险都将在遥远的马奎特大陆继续进行。本章的\"{@area Next Steps|171|x} \"部分解释了如何将人物从巴佐克山过渡到新的地点。",
	"From around the corner of a crumbling building, five twitching, skinless masses of blinking eyes and slavering mouths wriggle into view. One of them is shredding the flesh of a hapless soldier in three of its amorphous maws. Trumpets blare an alarm, and several Aurora Watch soldiers hurry into the streets. One of them, a male drow, pauses to address you. \"Newcomers? No time for pleasantries—draw your weapons or get to safety! Find me at the barracks after!\"": "从一栋摇摇欲坠的建筑物的拐角处，五个抽搐的、没有皮肤的、眼睛眨动的、嘴里发出奴役声的物体蠕动着进入人们的视野。其中一个正在用它的三个无定形的大嘴撕碎一个无能的士兵的肉。喇叭响起了警报，几个曙光之神的士兵匆匆忙忙地跑到街上。其中一个男性乌鸦停顿了一下，对你说。\"新来的？没有时间寒暄了--拔出你们的武器，或者到安全的地方去！\"。之后到军营找我！\"",
	"To the people of Bazzoxan, Verin is a beacon of hope amid the darkness that shrouds the town. But the weight of responsibility colors Verin's otherwise bright and youthful demeanor with melancholy. He cares about the town he has sworn to protect, but he is weary of the incessant threat posed by the denizens of the Betrayers' Rise.": "对于巴佐桑的人们来说，维林是笼罩在该镇的黑暗中的希望之光。但责任的重压使维林原本明亮而年轻的举止染上了忧郁的色彩。他关心他发誓要保护的小镇，但他对背叛者崛起的居民所构成的持续威胁感到厌倦。",
	"The alarms sounding from watchtowers across the town indicate that similar attacks are happening in other areas. Civilians head for secure buildings while members of the Aurora Watch mobilize to engage the threat. Characters can tell from everyone's drawn faces and practiced movements that attacks like this occur often. The characters can either get involved in the fight or run for safety.": "全镇的瞭望塔发出的警报声表明，其他地区也在发生类似的攻击。平民们前往安全的建筑物，而曙光守望的成员则动员起来与威胁作斗争。角色可以从每个人的表情和练习过的动作中看出，这样的攻击经常发生。角色们要么参与战斗，要么逃往安全地带。",
	"If the characters choose to help the Aurora Watch, everyone rolls initiative. {@creature Verin Thelyss|CRCotN|Verin} and two orc {@creature Guard||guards} of the Aurora Watch stay with the party, while the rest of the soldiers leave to secure other parts of the city.": "如果角色们选择帮助极光守卫，每个人都会掷出主动权。曙光守卫的{@creature Verin Thelyss|CRCotN|Verin}和两个兽人{@creature Guard||guards}留在队伍中，其余的士兵则离开去保护城市的其他地方。",
	"If the rivals are accompanying the characters when they enter Bazzoxan, Verin directs the rivals to assist in defense of the infirmary ({@area area B3|0fe|x}). They're momentarily indignant at being ordered around, but they fall in line when Ayo echoes the command.": "如果对手在进入巴佐克山时陪伴着角色，维林会指示对手协助保卫医务室（{@area area B3|0fe|x}）。他们对被人指使一时愤愤不平，但当阿尤附和命令时，他们就排好队了。",
	"If the characters flee, they must find a safe building in which to hide. It quickly becomes clear that most such places have already been barricaded shut by the residents holed up inside them. A character who wants to get into one of these safe houses must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check to convince its occupants to open the door. Alternatively, a character can make a DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to scan the area, finding an available safe house on a success. A character can make either check once per minute. Every time a character gets a failure on one of these checks, a {@creature gibbering mouther} emerges from hiding and attacks that character.": "如果人物逃跑，他们必须找到一个安全的建筑物来躲藏。很快就会发现，大多数这样的地方已经被躲在里面的居民封锁了。想进入这些安全屋的角色必须通过DC20魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检定成功，才能说服里面的人打开门。或者，一个角色可以用DC20的智慧({@skill Perception})检查来扫描这个区域，如果成功，就能找到一个可用的安全屋。一个角色每分钟可以做一次这样的检查。每当一个角色在这些检查中失败，一个{@creature gibbering mouther}就会从藏身处出现并攻击该角色。",
	"If the rivals are with the characters when they enter Bazzoxan, Verin orders the rivals to stay and fight while the characters flee. Ayo Jabe doesn't like taking orders, but she falls in line—as do her companions.": "如果对手在人物进入巴佐克山时与他们在一起，维林就会命令对手留下来作战，而人物则逃跑。阿尤-贾贝不喜欢接受命令，但她和她的同伴们一样，服从命令。",
	"The alarms stop after 5 minutes, signaling that the danger has been quelled. The uneasy calm of daily life in Bazzoxan resumes. The monsters that attacked other parts of town have been handled by Aurora Watch soldiers.": "警报在5分钟后停止，表明危险已被平息。巴佐克山的日常生活又恢复了不安的平静。袭击镇上其他地方的怪物已经被曙光守望的士兵处理了。",
	"If the characters fought alongside Verin, the rivals are safe at the infirmary and eager for news.": "如果人物与维林并肩作战，对手在医务室很安全，渴望得到消息。",
	"If the characters fled with the civilians, leaving the rivals to fight alongside Verin, Ayo Jabe was gravely wounded in the battle. Maggie Keeneyes carried Ayo to the infirmary, where she is treated by Dermot Wurder. Irvan and Galsariad linger outside the infirmary, concerned about their group's future.": "如果人物与平民一起逃亡，留下对手与维林并肩作战，阿尤-贾贝在战斗中受了重伤。玛吉-基尼耶斯将阿尤背到医务室，在那里接受德莫特-沃德的治疗。欧文和加尔萨里德在医务室外徘徊，担心他们小组的未来。",
	"If the characters are with Verin when the battle ends, he formally introduces himself as the leader of Bazzoxan and apologizes that their arrival was complicated by the gibbering mouther attack. He answers general questions about Bazzoxan (anything found in the \"Bazzoxan Overview\" section below) but soon excuses himself to check on the rest of the town. He leaves the characters to explore Bazzoxan at their leisure and invites them to meet with him later at the Gatehold Barracks ({@area area B4|104|x}).": "如果战斗结束时人物和维林在一起，他就会正式介绍自己是巴佐克山的领袖，并为他们的到来被胡言乱语的人袭击而感到抱歉。他回答了关于巴佐克山的一般问题（任何问题都可以在下面的 \"巴佐克山概述 \"部分找到），但很快就借口去检查镇上的其他地方。他让角色们在闲暇时探索巴佐克山，并邀请他们稍后在Gatehold兵营（{@area area B4|104|x}）与他会面。",
	"Bazzoxan hums with activity. People are cleaning up debris from the last attack, tending to the injured, performing last rites for the dead, repairing fortifications, and preparing for the next incursion. Gibbering mouthers—created by demons in the Betrayers' Rise—are common threats, as are dretches, quasits, and other lesser demons. On rare occasions, more powerful demons attack, or demonic energy animates the bodies of dead Aurora Watch soldiers.": "巴佐克山充满了活力。人们正在清理上次袭击的残骸，照顾伤员，为死者举行最后的仪式，修理防御工事，并为下一次入侵做准备。由 \"背叛者的崛起 \"中的恶魔创造的口齿不清的人是常见的威胁，还有矮人、夸塞特和其他较小的恶魔。在极少数情况下，更强大的恶魔会发动攻击，或者恶魔的能量会使死去的极光守望士兵的尸体变得生动。",
	"Most of the town's inhabitants are soldiers who understand that their role here is not to defeat the horrors in the Betrayers' Rise, but to keep them in check for as long as possible. The town's civilian residents go about their lives as normally as they can, and few complain about their situation.": "镇上的大多数居民都是士兵，他们明白他们在这里的作用不是打败背叛者崛起中的恐怖，而是尽可能长时间地控制他们。该镇的平民居民尽可能地正常生活，很少有人抱怨他们的处境。",
	"Details about locations in the town can be found in the \"{@area Locations in Bazzoxan|0f2|x}\" section later in the chapter.": "关于镇上地点的详细情况可以在本章后面的\"{@area Locations in Bazzoxan|0f2|x} \"部分找到。",
	"Bazzoxan is built into the base of a rust-red mountain range north of the valley known as the Barbed Fields. The craggy, rocky landscape is mostly devoid of plant life, except for a few scraggly pines and patches of scrub.": "巴佐克山建在被称为 \"带刺的田野 \"的山谷北部的锈红色山脉的山脚下。嶙峋的岩石地貌大多没有植物，只有几棵杂乱无章的松树和成片的灌木丛。",
	"Bazzoxan was once a thriving mining town, but it was ravaged when explorers awakened a portal to the Abyss in the depths of the Betrayers' Rise. Many of the town's buildings were destroyed when the first surge of demons attacked, and the town was hastily converted into a military outpost to hold the demons at bay. The only structures regularly tended to are the Aurora Watch barracks, most of which are buildings converted from their original purpose.": "巴佐桑曾经是一个繁荣的采矿镇，但当探险家们在背叛者崛起的深处唤醒了一个通往深渊的入口时，它被蹂躏了。当第一波恶魔袭击时，镇上的许多建筑都被摧毁了，镇子被匆忙地改成了军事前哨，以抵御恶魔的侵袭。唯一有规律的建筑是极光守望的军营，其中大部分是由原来的用途改造的建筑。",
	"Among the most prominent features of Bazzoxan are the town's two sacrifice engines, each one a 30-foot-deep pit lined with rows of silver blades. The blades can be made to spin by pulling a lever near the edge of the pit. A creature in the pit while the blades are spinning takes 44 ({@dice 8d10}) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns.": "巴佐桑最突出的特点是该镇的两个祭祀引擎，每个引擎都是一个30英尺深的坑，坑里有一排排银色的刀片。通过拉动坑边的杠杆，可以使刀片旋转。当刀片旋转时，坑里的生物在每个回合开始时都会受到44({@dice 8d10})的砍伤。",
	"In bygone days, servants of the Betrayer Gods threw mortals into these pits to appease their evil lords. Now, the Aurora Watch herds demons and other monsters into them to avoid prolonged battles.": "在过去的日子里，背叛者之神的仆人将凡人扔进这些坑里，以安抚他们邪恶的领主。现在，极光守望者将恶魔和其他怪物放进坑里，以避免长时间的战斗。",
	"The majority of Bazzoxan's inhabitants are members of the Aurora Watch. Also residing here are a handful of Kryn Dynasty arcanists attempting to find and seal the planar rifts that threaten the city. Dealing with these phenomena is far beyond the characters' abilities at present, and in any event they can't afford to linger in Bazzoxan, lest their rivals find the prayer site of Avandra before them. Nonetheless, this chapter provides an opportunity for you to foreshadow the devastation that the rift to the Netherdeep can cause for Ank'Harel later in the adventure.": "巴佐克斯安的大部分居民是极光守望的成员。这里还居住着少数克里恩王朝的奥术师，他们试图找到并封印威胁该城市的平面裂缝。处理这些现象远远超出了人物目前的能力，而且无论如何他们都不能在巴佐克山逗留，以免他们的对手在他们之前找到阿凡达的祈祷地。尽管如此，这一章还是为你提供了一个机会，预示着通往尼瑟斯底层的裂缝会在以后的冒险中对安克哈勒造成破坏。",
	"The few civilians who remain in Bazzoxan support the soldiers as well as they can and are trained in the basics of combat in case the forces from the Betrayers' Rise begin to overwhelm the military. Most residents are drow, but some goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears, orcs, and other Xhorhasian folk live here as well.": "留在巴佐桑的少数平民尽可能地支持士兵，并接受基本的战斗训练，以防背叛者崛起的部队开始压倒军队。大多数居民是鸦人，但也有一些地精、霍布格林、虫人、兽人和其他Xhorhasian人住在这里。",
	"Most residents of Bazzoxan avoid conversation, citing the need to tend to their duties if they are approached. The Bazzoxan Scenes table provides suggestions for small engagements the characters can experience while exploring the town.": "巴佐克山的大多数居民都避免交谈，如果有人找他们谈话，他们会说需要处理自己的职责。巴佐克山的场景表提供了人物在探索该镇时可以经历的小型约定的建议。",
	"After the encounter with the gibbering mouthers, the rivals lose some of their bluster. Though they try to keep up appearances, they are severely shaken by the experience. Galsariad is the most deeply affected, his already sarcastic demeanor becoming close to insulting toward friend and foe alike as his insecurities threaten to rise to the surface. Irvan becomes withdrawn, overwhelmed by the oppressive atmosphere in Bazzoxan and the morbid humor of the locals. Dermot throws himself fervently into following the Luxon's precepts, determined to do whatever it takes to protect his friends and rarely leaving Ayo's side. If he is persuaded to take a moment away from the group, he talks openly about his concerns. He recognizes that his friends have been traumatized and would like them to go home rather than continuing. No matter what, he intends to support them to the end.": "在遇到胡言乱语的人之后，对手们失去了一些虚张声势的能力。虽然他们试图保持表面形象，但他们被这次经历严重震撼了。加萨里德受到的影响最深，他本来就讽刺的举止变得对朋友和敌人都近乎侮辱，因为他的不安全感有可能上升到表面。欧文变得孤僻，被巴佐克山的压抑气氛和当地人的病态幽默所淹没。德莫特狂热地投入到遵守卢克逊的戒律中，决心不惜一切代价保护他的朋友，并且很少离开阿尤的身边。如果他被劝说离开这群人一会儿，他就会公开谈论他的担忧。他认识到他的朋友们已经受到了创伤，希望他们回家，而不是继续。无论怎样，他都打算支持他们到最后。",
	"If Ayo was injured in the encounter as a result of the characters' decision to run and hide, the rivals are hostile toward whomever they see as the characters' leader, and Maggie Keeneyes is hostile toward the entire party because of their cowardice. Ayo is shaken by the injuries, causing her to question her skill as a leader, but she bears no ill will toward the characters for putting their safety first.": "如果Ayo在遭遇战中受伤是由于角色们决定逃跑和躲藏的结果，那么对手们就会对他们认为是角色们的领导者的人产生敌意，而Maggie Keeneyes则会因为他们的胆怯而对整个队伍产生敌意。阿尤因受伤而动摇，使她对自己作为领袖的能力产生了怀疑，但她对角色们把自己的安全放在第一位的做法没有恶意。",
	"The following locations are keyed to the map of Bazzoxan.": "以下地点都是以巴佐珊的地图为关键。",
	"The entrance to Bazzoxan is a wide gate that is opened or closed from atop its battlements by operating a series of wheels, chains, and pulleys.": "巴佐克山的入口是一个宽阔的大门，通过操作一系列的轮子、链条和滑轮，从其城垛顶部打开或关闭。",
	"The crematorium is a simple stone building built against the mountainside.": "火葬场是一座简单的石头建筑，依山而建。",
	"When the characters approach the building, read or paraphrase the following:": "当人物接近建筑物时，阅读或转述以下内容。",
	"Thick, acrid smoke billows from the chimneys of this stone building. Corpses wrapped in beige cloth are stacked in a small yard northeast of the building.": "这座石头建筑的烟囱里冒着浓烈的刺鼻的烟。建筑物东北面的一个小院子里堆放着用米色布包裹的尸体。",
	"A willowy man wearing a leather apron greets you at the entrance with surprising cheer. \"New bodies for Bazzoxan, I see!\" Behind him stands a giant of a man: muscular, blue-eyed, with short-cropped hair and a missing arm.": "一个身穿皮围裙的柳叶形男子在入口处迎接你，他的欢呼声令人惊讶。\"我看到了，巴佐克桑的新机构！\" 在他身后站着一个巨人：肌肉发达，蓝眼睛，短发，缺少一只手臂。",
	"When the characters arrive, the brothers are burning the latest batch of corpses. Reynard promptly asks the characters to help him and his brother with their task.": "当人物到达时，兄弟们正在焚烧最新的一批尸体。雷纳德立即要求这些人物帮助他和他的兄弟完成他们的任务。",
	"Characters who are helping with the pile of bodies find the source of Reynard's disgust: a dead vrock whose body reeks of offal and blood. Reynard has been putting off the task of burning it because he finds the demon repulsive and because the corpse hasn't dissolved into a pool of demonic ichor as it should have, which suggests some sort of abnormality.": "正在帮助处理尸体堆的人物发现了雷纳德厌恶的源头：一个死掉的弗洛克，其身体散发着内脏和血腥味。雷纳德一直在拖延烧掉它的任务，因为他觉得这个恶魔令人厌恶，而且尸体没有像它应该的那样溶化成一滩恶魔的汁液，这表明它有某种异常情况。",
	"Before anyone can dispose of the vrock's remains, a commotion arises nearby:": "在所有人都能处理好弗洛克的遗体之前，附近出现了一阵骚动。",
	"\"Wait! Stop!\" a voice shouts from down the street. A bookish tiefling jogs into view. A variety of archaeology tools hang at his waist along with a satchel holding his notebooks. \"You can't burn that yet. I need to study it!\" Reaching into the satchel, he pulls out a badge and holds it up, as if the badge alone explained his reason for being here.": "\"等等！停下！\"一个声音从街道上喊道。一个书生气十足的铁弗林慢悠悠地走进了人们的视野。他腰间挂着各种考古工具，还有一个装着笔记本的挎包。\"你还不能烧掉这个。我需要研究它！\" 他把手伸进书包里，掏出一个徽章并举起来，仿佛光是这个徽章就能解释他来这里的原因。",
	"The tiefling is {@creature Prolix Yusaf|CRCotN}, a lawful neutral {@creature scholarly agent|CRCotN} (see {@adventure appendix A|CRCotN|8}) from the Allegiance of Allsight. His badge displays the symbol of his faction: a scroll bearing a single, watchful eye.": "这个盗贼是{@creature Prolix Yusaf|CRCotN}，来自Allsight Allegiance的合法中立{@creature scholarly agent|CRCotN}（见{@adventure appendix A|CRCotN|8}）。他的徽章上显示了他的派别的标志：一个印有单眼的卷轴。",
	"Prolix introduces himself as an archaeologist from Ank'Harel, a city on the distant continent of Marquet. He nervously explains that because vrocks often swallow jewelry and other ornamental objects, he has reason to believe that the vrock might have a few valuable items from the Betrayers' Rise in its stomach—and he'd like to try to cut them out before the Allertons burn the corpse.": "普利克斯自我介绍说，他是来自遥远的马凯大陆上的城市安克哈勒的考古学家。他紧张地解释说，由于弗洛克经常吞下珠宝和其他装饰品，他有理由相信弗洛克的肚子里可能有一些背叛者崛起的宝贵物品--他想在阿勒顿人烧掉尸体之前把它们切出来。",
	"\"I'm an archaeologist, but I'm not here to perform archaeology, per se. I was sent by the Allegiance of Allsight to spy on a rival agent of the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream.\" Prolix says that the Allegiance doesn't know why the Consortium dispatched someone to Bazzoxan, but the reason can't be good.": "\"我是一名考古学家，但我不是来进行考古的，本身就是。我是被Allsight的Allegiance派来监视Vermilion Dream财团的一个敌对代理人的。\" 普罗利克斯说，阿列克斯不知道为什么财团要派人到巴佐桑，但原因不可能是好的。",
	"\"Aloysia. That's her name. She's looking for something in the Betrayers' Rise. She's not hard to spot. Tall, pale, dressed in red. Cold-blooded. Seems like she'd do anything to get what she wants. And what she wants is... well, that's what I'd like to know!\" Prolix goes on to say that both he and Aloysia are staying at the Ready Room ({@area area R7|142|x}).": "\"阿洛伊西亚。这是她的名字。她在寻找背叛者的崛起中的东西。她并不难发现。高个子，脸色苍白，穿着红衣服。冷血。看起来她为了得到她想要的东西会做任何事。而她想要的是......嗯，这就是我想知道的！\" 普利克斯继续说，他和阿洛伊西亚都住在准备室（{@area area R7|142|x}）。",
	"\"Of course not! But it came from inside the temple—it must hold something important.\" Prolix intends to keep the box and its contents from falling into Aloysia's hands.": "\"当然不是！\"。但它来自寺庙内部--它一定装着重要的东西。\" 普罗利克斯打算不让盒子和里面的东西落入阿洛伊西亚的手中。",
	"If the characters let Prolix keep the puzzle box, he offers them a deal: if they find out what Aloysia is up to and stop her, he will give them 200 gp, as well as the box and whatever might be inside it.": "如果角色们让普利克斯保留这个谜题盒，他就会给他们一个交易：如果他们找出阿洛伊西亚的目的并阻止她，他就会给他们200金币，以及这个盒子和里面可能存在的东西。",
	"If the characters have the {@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN} and show it to Prolix, he says he doesn't know what the jewel represents, although he recognizes it as something both powerful and ancient. If the characters give him the opportunity, he draws a quick sketch of the item, jots down some notes, and invites the characters to return with him to the Crystal Chateau, his university in Ank'Harel, once their respective missions in Bazzoxan are complete. He suggests the university's libraries might have more information about the jewel's purpose.": "如果人物拿到了{@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN}，并把它拿给普利克斯看，他说他不知道这颗宝石代表什么，尽管他认识到它是一种既强大又古老的东西。如果人物给他机会，他就会快速画出这个东西的草图，记下一些笔记，并邀请人物在完成各自在巴佐桑的任务后，和他一起回到水晶城堡，即他在安克哈雷尔的大学。他建议大学的图书馆可能会有更多关于这颗珠宝的用途的信息。",
	"If the characters seem eager to learn more about the jewel, Prolix mentions meeting a \"real smartie\" who is also staying at the Ready Room ({@area area B7|116|x}). This other scholar is a tiefling named Question, who Prolix believes is visiting Bazzoxan for research as well. Prolix relates having an animated discussion with Question the other night about key historical figures of the Calamity.": "如果这些人物似乎急于了解更多关于宝石的信息，普罗利克斯就会提到遇到一个 \"真正的聪明人\"，他也住在准备室（{@area area B7|116|x}）。这名学者是一个名叫 \"问题 \"的铁皮人，普利克斯认为他也是为了研究而访问巴佐桑。普利克斯说，有一天晚上他和 \"问题 \"就灾难的主要历史人物进行了热烈的讨论。",
	"Three buildings on the perimeter of the central square have doors marked with a symbol of a hand alight with magic, identifying them as places of healing. When the characters enter one of the buildings, read or paraphrase the following:": "中央广场周边的三座建筑的门上标有一只被魔法点燃的手的符号，表明它们是治疗的地方。当人物进入其中一座建筑时，请阅读或解读以下内容。",
	"The walls are lined with shelves that hold old books and medical supplies. The floor is crammed with narrow cots. There's a small office in the back, its door ajar, and the air reeks of medicinal poultices.": "墙壁上挂着架子，上面放着旧书和医疗用品。地板上挤满了狭窄的小床。后面有一个小办公室，门虚掩着，空气中弥漫着药膏的味道。",
	"When she sees the characters, the priest leaves her patient's side to greet them, introducing herself as Bautha Dyrr. She then asks them about their health. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check identifies a pin in the shape of a black wing attached to Bautha's cloak as the holy symbol of Xalicas, a legendary solar who served as the right hand of Corellon the Arch Heart before falling in the Calamity. As a follower of Xalicas, Bautha disapproves of the reclamation efforts in Bazzoxan; though she supports the effort to hold back the forces of the Abyss, she believes the Kryn Dynasty's military presence here is creating needless casualties with little to show for it. Nevertheless, Bautha strives to heal and protect those in Bazzoxan, and she casts {@spell cure wounds} or {@spell lesser restoration} on victims for free, as long as she has spell slots to spare.": "当她看到这些人物时，牧师离开她的病人身边，向他们问好，介绍自己是鲍塔-迪尔。然后她询问他们的健康状况。一个通过DC15智力({@skill Religion})检查成功的人物可以识别出Bautha斗篷上的一个黑色翅膀形状的别针是Xalicas的神圣标志，Xalicas是一个传奇的太阳神，在灾难中倒下之前曾是大心脏Corellon的左右手。作为Xalicas的追随者，Bautha不赞成在Bazzoxan的开垦工作；虽然她支持阻止深渊力量的努力，但她认为克莱恩王朝在这里的军事存在造成了不必要的伤亡，却没有什么可炫耀的。尽管如此，鲍特哈还是努力治疗和保护巴佐桑的人们，只要她有法术槽，她就会免费为受害者施放（1%）或（2%）的法术。",
	"If the characters show Bautha the {@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN}, identify it by name, and ask her about it, she doesn't recognize it, but something about the name reminds her of an old tale. She thinks for a moment, then says:": "如果人物给鲍特哈看了{@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN}，指出它的名字，并问她关于它的情况，她不认识它，但这个名字让她想起了一个古老的故事。她想了一会儿，然后说。",
	"\"Three prayers... Oh! You know, it must be that old story about the champion of three gods. Goodness gracious, I can't believe I remembered it. It's a fragment of a fragment of a legend, even in temples in Vasselheim and Ank'Harel.\" She clears her throat. \"Long ago, a hero of the Calamity begged for aid from three different gods in his time of need. Avandra the Change Bringer was one of them, and I think Sehanine the Moon Weaver was another. And, uh, I'm afraid I don't remember anything else.\"": "\"三个祈祷... 哦！你知道，这一定是那个关于三个神的冠军的古老故事。天哪，我真不敢相信我竟然记住了它。这是一个片段的片段的传说，甚至在瓦塞尔海姆和安克哈勒的寺庙里都有。\" 她清了清嗓子。\"很久以前，一位灾难的英雄在他需要的时候向三位不同的神灵乞求援助。变化使者阿凡达是其中之一，我想织月者塞哈宁是另一个。还有，呃，恐怕我不记得其他事情了。\"",
	"As the characters prepare to leave the infirmary, Bautha suddenly recalls one other detail:": "当这些人物准备离开医务室时，Bautha突然想起了另一个细节。",
	"\"This might be a fiction, but Avandra is said to have grieved for the hero—not because he had died, but because she feared her aid forced him to give up so much of himself that he would be robbed of a future.\"": "\"这可能是个虚构的故事，但据说阿凡达为英雄感到悲伤--不是因为他死了，而是因为她担心她的援助迫使他放弃了很多自己的东西，以至于他被剥夺了未来。\"",
	"As the characters make their way to the exit, the wounded member of the Aurora Watch calls for the characters to approach her cot. Her body is covered with wounds she received in the gibbering mouther attack.": "当人物走向出口时，极光守望的受伤成员呼吁人物靠近她的小床。她的身体上布满了在胡言乱语的攻击中受到的伤痕。",
	"When the characters enter this area for the first time, read or paraphrase the following:": "当人物第一次进入这个区域时，阅读或转述以下内容。",
	"These barracks are filled with the sounds of chatter, voices shouting orders, and clanging metal. Armored Aurora Watch soldiers go about their business, performing drills and sharpening weapons.": "这些军营里充满了喋喋不休的声音，喊着命令的声音，以及金属的叮当声。装甲的极光守望者士兵在做他们的事情，进行演习和磨练武器。",
	"The barracks are divided into four main sections: the war room, the mess hall, the training area, and the sleeping quarters.

	"The vision shifts again, and everyone in the company of soldiers is dead except for Alyxian, who continues to fight while surrounded by the corpses of mortals and demons.

At the end of his prayer, he's lifted to his feet by a tall young woman with light brown skin and flowing black hair.": "视线再次转移，连队里的每个人都死了，除了阿利贤，他在被凡人和恶魔的尸体包围时继续战斗。他被一个大猩猩般的恶魔的爪子扔到了战场上。场景模糊了，他跪倒在一个简单的木制祭坛前，恳求着，上面有阿凡达的神圣标志。在他的祈祷结束时，他被一个有着浅棕色皮肤和飘逸黑发的高大年轻女子扶起。",
	"A foreboding voice cuts through this scene of divine intervention, and Alyxian freezes. \"The Change Bringer and a mortal,\" the voice intones. \"What brings you into my sacred, devouring darkness? Even if you save him, Change Bringer, he will suffer. He will die. He will be forgotten. All that he has worked to save will crumble and be devoured by worms. Why invite further suffering? Let go. Give in. All is futile in the end, so why...\"": "一个不祥的声音划破了这个神圣的干预场面，阿利贤愣住了。\"变化的使者和一个凡人，\"这个声音沉吟道。\"是什么让你进入我神圣的、吞噬性的黑暗？即使你救了他，变化使者，他也会受苦。他将死去。他将被遗忘。他所努力拯救的一切都会崩溃，被虫子吞噬。为什么要招致更多的痛苦？放手吧。屈服吧。一切到头来都是徒劳的，那么为什么......\"",
	"As the voice trails off, Alyxian turns to face you and falls to his knees in tears.

Please, help me set it right.\"": "随着声音的消失，阿利森转过身来面对你，跪倒在地，泪流满面。景色变了，这个被抛弃的战士现在在水下，在一座沉没的城市的废墟中。\"爬行王说的是真的，\"他喃喃道。\"一切都是徒劳的。一切都被遗忘了......而我在黑暗中迷失了。请帮助我把它纠正过来。\"",
	"The vision persists long enough for the characters to speak to Alyxian for a few moments. Once the characters have had three questions answered, the vision ends as new arrivals come on the scene (see \"Confrontation for the Jewel\" below). Alyxian addresses the characters' questions with the following information:": "异象持续的时间足以让人物与阿利森交谈片刻。一旦人物得到了三个问题的回答，幻象就会结束，因为有新的人来到了现场（见下面的 \"为宝石而对抗\"）。Alyxian用以下信息来回答人物的问题。",

These divine gifts transformed him from a mortal being into something more. Alyxian says that the city of elves and orcs was destroyed centuries ago. (This is partly true; the city Alyxian speaks of is now the underwater ruin called Cael Morrow, described in {@adventure chapter 5|CRCotN|5}.)": "他在灾难中战斗，被称为阿普特恩，因为他三次向诸神祈求力量，三次都得到了力量--第一次是在荒野山庄的海岸，第二次是在背叛者崛起的深处，还有一次是在马奎特丛林中的精灵和兽人城市中的拱心神殿。这些神圣的礼物将他从一个凡人转变为更多的东西。Alyxian说那座精灵和兽人之城在几个世纪前就被摧毁了。（这部分是真的；Alyxian所说的城市现在是名为Cael Morrow的水下废墟，在{@adventure chapter 5|CRCotN|5}中描述。）",
	"Alyxian is imprisoned in an underwater place lit by a crimson glow. He grows angry as he explains that mortals are harvesting the source of the glow and leaving him in darkness, and that this act is torture for him.

Bereft of her moniker \"the Raven Queen,\" here the god is associated with twilight, inevitability, and the passage of time, and she presides over the transition between life and death.

	"Situated on the far western side of the Guided District, the octagonal Tower of Memory juts out of the ground at a slightly crooked angle.

	"Built partially into the side of the mountain that borders the north side of the district, the Sunfire Forge is the premier blacksmith and weapons manufacturer in Ank'Harel. Its name comes from the forge's unique power source: liquid sunlight, harvested from the iridescent crystals lining its roof. The consistent heat of this concentrated form of energy allows for the creation of fine metalwork that incorporates fragile components such as arcane minerals and gem dust. Two glowing streams of sunfire cascade down the sides of the forge's pitched roof before coming to rest in stone reservoirs, where the liquid is stored before being funneled into the forge.": "太阳火锻造厂部分建在与该区北侧接壤的山的一侧，是安克哈雷尔的首要铁匠和武器制造商。它的名字来自于锻造厂独特的动力来源：液体阳光，从其屋顶上的彩虹色晶体中获取的。这种集中的能量形式所产生的持续热量，使其能够创造出精细的金属制品，其中包含了脆弱的成分，如奥术矿物和宝石粉。两股发光的太阳之火从锻炉倾斜的屋顶两侧倾泻而下，然后停在石头水库中，液体在被输送到锻炉之前被储存在那里。",
	"Its atmosphere permeated by the smell of wet earth, the River District is where most of the city's farming is done. Strips of irrigated cropland are intermingled with newer hydroponic farms, and in place of roads, canals connect the subdivisions of the district. Most folks traverse the canals of the River District in skiffs and lightweight canoes.": "河区的空气中弥漫着湿润的泥土气息，这里是城市大部分农业生产的地方。成片的灌溉农田与较新的水培农场交织在一起，而且用运河代替道路，连接该区的各个分区。大多数人乘坐小艇和轻型独木舟在河区的运河中穿行。",
	"This glass dome crowns the source of water in Ank'Harel: the oasis around which the city was built. All the canals in the River District originate from the Life Dome, and the structure is a center of celebration and a monument to the city's history. At night, the inside of the dome is magically lit by drifting orbs of blue and green luminescence, painting the nearby area in a display of colored light.": "这个玻璃穹顶为安克哈雷尔的水源加冕：这个城市就是围绕这个绿洲建立的。河区的所有运河都起源于生命穹顶，该结构是一个庆祝中心和城市历史的纪念碑。到了晚上，穹顶内部神奇地被漂浮的蓝色和绿色发光体照亮，将附近地区描绘成彩色的光影。",
	"The Life Dome also serves an important agricultural purpose. Because the water that fills Ank'Harel's oasis flows not from a natural source but from underground caverns created by the acts of the gods, the water level frequently fluctuates. The water can surge forth or slow to a trickle, threatening to bring about floods or dry spells, respectively. To counteract this problem, the Life Dome instantly transmutes any water that exceeds the accepted level into vapor and stores it in the seams of the dome. When the water level drops, the stored vapor is transmuted back into liquid and fed into the irrigation canals.": "生命穹顶也有一个重要的农业用途。由于填充安克哈勒绿洲的水不是来自自然源头，而是来自众神行为所创造的地下洞穴，因此水位经常波动。水可能会涌出或减缓到涓涓细流，分别威胁到洪水或旱灾的发生。为了解决这个问题，生命穹顶将任何超过公认水位的水瞬间转化为蒸汽，并将其储存在穹顶的缝隙中。当水位下降时，储存的水蒸气又被转化为液体，并被输送到灌溉渠中。",
	"The scope of Old Man Kruuk's operation far exceeds what anyone might suspect—or even what he should be capable of as a single individual. Some rumormongers suggest that Kruuk is a high-ranking member of the Veil, but no one has verified this supposition.": "克鲁克老人的行动范围远远超过了任何人的猜测，甚至超过了他作为一个人应有的能力。一些造谣者认为克鲁克是 \"面纱 \"的高级成员，但没有人证实这一推测。",
	"The most luxurious of Ank'Harel's arboretums, the Steam Gardens are popular because they include a bathhouse and spa. Water from the canals is fed into the gardens' magically fueled hot springs, which bubble as they release massaging jets of water.": "蒸汽花园是安克-哈雷尔植物园中最奢华的地方，因为它包括一个澡堂和温泉，所以很受欢迎。来自运河的水被输入到花园的神奇温泉中，这些温泉在释放按摩水柱时冒着气泡。",
	"The center of military activity and law enforcement in Ank'Harel, the Sand-Herald District houses the headquarters of the Hands of Ord. The organization's stronghold is a major feature of the district, dwarfed only by the Cerulean Palace.": "作为安克-哈雷尔的军事活动和执法中心，沙-赫尔德区是奥德之手的总部所在地。该组织的据点是该区的一个主要特征，仅次于塞鲁利亚宫。",

	"Skyship travel is undertaken primarily by those who want to avoid the time and danger of an ocean voyage or a long trek through the desert—and who can afford the cost of such transportation.

	"Unknown to Prolix, the rumors of a second entrance to Cael Morrow were planted by Lymmle Wist, a member of the Sentinels of Memory who has infiltrated the Allegiance of Allsight by posing as a highly accredited professor of antiquities. Though Lymmle doesn't appear during this mission, her machinations drive the plot. The characters are walking into an ambush—an effort by the Sentinels of Memory to wipe out those who would bring Cael Morrow back into living memory.": "普利克斯不知道，关于凯尔-莫罗的第二个入口的谣言是由记忆哨兵的成员莱姆勒-威斯特（Lymmle Wist）栽赃的，她假扮成一个被高度认可的古物学教授，潜入了万能的联盟。虽然莱姆勒在这次任务中没有出现，但她的阴谋却推动了剧情的发展。这些人物正走进一个埋伏--记忆哨兵试图消灭那些会让凯尔-莫罗重新回到人们记忆中的人。",
	"When they arrive at the Life Dome, the characters are met by Carliale Kroogan, who's standing outside:": "当他们到达生命穹顶时，站在外面的卡利亚尔-克罗根见到了这些人物。",
	"\"I rarely get visitors,\" the gnome explains before turning to face the Life Dome. He holds aloft a thin shard of iridescent, glowing quartz, and, with a quiet hum, one of the dome's glass panels suddenly comes alight with blue and purple arcane runes—which then flicker and fade, leaving behind an opening. \"Come on in! I'll give you the tour.\"": "\"我很少有访客，\"地精解释说，然后转身面对生命穹顶。他高举一块薄薄的彩虹色发光石英碎片，随着一声轻哼，穹顶的一块玻璃板突然亮起了蓝色和紫色的奥术符文--然后闪烁消逝，留下了一个开口。\"进来吧! 我给你介绍一下。\"",
	"The inside of the dome is humid and sweltering, the smell of damp earth hitting one's senses along with a blast of hot air. A series of crystal bridges span the oasis's 60-foot-diameter lake, and the edges of the dome are lined with vegetation. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 17 or higher notice a brief, cool current of air as they begin to move about inside the dome (the side effect of an {@creature invisible stalker} stealing Carliale's magic crystal).": "穹顶内部潮湿而闷热，潮湿的泥土气息与一阵阵热气一起冲击着人们的感官。一系列的水晶桥横跨绿洲的60英尺直径的湖泊，穹顶的边缘长满了植物。被动智慧({@skill Perception})得分在17分以上的角色在开始在穹顶内活动时，会注意到一股短暂的、凉爽的气流（这是{@creature invisible stalker}偷窃卡利亚尔的魔法水晶的副作用）。",
	"Carliale tries to answer any questions the characters have about the oasis. He knows the following information:": "卡利亚尔试图回答人物关于绿洲的任何问题。他知道以下信息。",
	"The oasis is the primary source of fresh water in Ank'Harel.": "该绿洲是安克哈勒的主要淡水来源。",

	"Relics retrieved from the Allegiance of Allsight's expeditions indicate that Cael Morrow was the site of a pre-Calamity society originally built above the water. Carliale theorizes that natural tectonic shifting caused the city to slip beneath the surface, but the fluctuation of the water level in the caverns seems to defy explanation.": "从Allegiance of Allsight的探险中收回的遗物表明，Cael Morrow是一个前卡拉米特社会的遗址，最初建在水面上。Carliale推断，自然构造的变化导致城市滑落到地表之下，但洞穴中水位的波动似乎无法解释。",
	"The Life Dome regulates the water flow to and through the canals. Using a combination of enchantment and engineering, the Life Dome dispenses water from the lake into the major canals while also drawing extra moisture from the air to supplement the water flow when necessary.": "生命之穹调节流入和通过运河的水流。利用魔法和工程的结合，生命穹顶将湖水分配到主要运河中，同时也从空气中吸取额外的水分，在必要时补充水流。",
	"The Life Dome normally functions automatically. As chief supervisor, Carliale can manually override the dome's controls and adjust the water level as needed.": "生命穹顶通常自动运行。作为首席监督员，卡利亚尔可以手动控制穹顶的控制装置，并根据需要调整水位。",
	"At some point during the conversation, Carliale notices that his arcane override—the magic crystal he uses to open the entrance to the Life Dome and to adjust the dome's controls—has disappeared from his pocket. He assures the party that he must have dropped it back at the entrance.": "在谈话的某个时刻，卡利亚尔注意到他的奥术超控器--他用来打开生命穹顶的入口和调整穹顶控制的魔法水晶--已经从他的口袋里消失了。他向大家保证，他一定是把它丢在了入口处。",
	"As Carliale begins searching for his missing arcane override crystal, read:": "当卡利亚尔开始寻找他丢失的奥术超控水晶时，请阅读。",
	"The surface of the lake begins to churn white with foam, and seconds later an enormous geyser of water bursts upward and outward, sending you flying.": "湖面开始搅动白色的泡沫，几秒钟后，一个巨大的水泉向上和向外迸发，把你送上天。",
	"Everyone in the Life Dome is swept outside the dome and propelled along a 5-foot-deep canal by the sudden surge of water.": "生命穹顶中的每个人都被冲到穹顶之外，被突然涌来的水推到一个5英尺深的运河上。",
	"After the battle, Carliale suspects that the {@condition invisible} stalkers' summoner is associated with either the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream or the Sentinels of Memory. He describes these factions to the characters if they ask about them (see \"{@area City Factions|192|x}\" earlier in the chapter).": "战斗结束后，卡利亚尔怀疑{@condition invisible}潜行者的召唤师与朱雀之梦的财团或记忆的哨兵有关。如果人物问起这些派别，他就会向他们介绍（见本章前面的\"{@area City Factions|192|x}\"）。",
	"After foiling the ambush, the characters can take a moment to regroup before returning to the Crystal Chateau.

	"Lymmle previously owned a {@item ring of red fury|CRCotN} (see {@adventure appendix B|CRCotN|9|{@item Ring of Red Fury|CRCotN}}), which was given to her by the Consortium as a reward for her services.

Recently, with the Allegiance of Allsight on high alert after the attack at the Life Dome, Lymmle planted the ring on {@creature Prolix Yusaf|CRCotN} and plans to falsely accuse the tiefling of being a traitor. Her contact with the ruidium in the ring has left its mark on her skin.": "莱姆勒以前拥有一枚{@item ring of red fury|CRCotN}(见{@adventure appendix B|CRCotN|9|{@item Ring of Red Fury|CRCotN}})，是财团送给她的，作为对她的奖励。她决定将这枚戒指作为一个更宏大计划的一部分。最近，在生命穹顶遭到袭击后，全知之心处于高度警戒状态，莱姆勒将戒指安放在{@creature Prolix Yusaf|CRCotN}身上，并计划诬陷铁皮人是个叛徒。她与戒指中的Ruidium接触后，在她的皮肤上留下了痕迹。",
	"Prolix wears nondescript dark clothes instead of his usual Allegiance of Allsight attire. When he and the characters are away from prying ears, he explains his plight:": "普罗利克斯穿的是不伦不类的深色衣服，而不是他一贯的 \"全知之明 \"的服装。当他和角色们远离窥探的耳朵时，他解释了自己的困境。",

You believe me, right?\"": "他在口袋里翻了翻，掏出一枚带有红色金属条纹的银戒指。\"我想有人把它塞进了我的口袋，但我发誓这不是我的。它看起来像是从凯尔-莫罗打捞上来的魔法物品之一，但我不能确定。你相信我，对吗？\"",
	"Prolix is earnest and desperate in his claims of innocence. He fears that whoever planted the ring on him also planted something in his satchel to further incriminate him. He has no intention of returning to the Crystal Chateau or checking in with his superiors until he learns who is trying to set him up.": "普利克斯认真而绝望地声称自己是无辜的。他担心，不管是谁在他身上安插了戒指，也在他的挎包里安插了一些东西，以进一步指控他。他不打算回到水晶城堡，也不打算向他的上级汇报，直到他知道谁在试图陷害他。",
	"If the characters agree to help, Prolix points them toward his friend, Bookkeeper Khime, who manages the Omnival Library in the Sigil District and has records of every item of antiquity salvaged from Cael Morrow.

	"Inspecting the building's front and making a successful DC 16 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check enables a character to notice that the sign hanging from the door's handle is surrounded by a field of colored dots. The dots seem erratically placed to the untrained eye, but a character who knows thieves' cant recognizes the pattern as part of a code, identifying this place as a repository of stolen goods. The sign alone, however, is not enough to prove that Kruuk is trafficking in illicit magic items.": "检查建筑物的正面，并成功地进行DC16智慧({@skill Perception})检查，可以使角色注意到挂在门把手上的标志被一圈彩色的点所包围。在未经训练的人看来，这些点的摆放很不规则，但了解盗贼行为的人却能认出这些图案是密码的一部分，从而确定这个地方是赃物的存放处。然而，仅凭这个标志还不足以证明克鲁克在贩卖非法魔法物品。",
	"If the characters try to engage Kruuk in conversation, he replies that the bakery is closed but offers to sell them some leftover tarts or rolls before they go.": "如果人物试图与克鲁克交谈，他就会回答说面包店已经关门了，但在他们走之前会向他们出售一些吃剩的蛋挞或面包卷。",

If the characters express interest in buying the weapon, Kruuk asks them to wait until his buyer arrives, after which he'll sell the blade to the highest bidder. If a character fails the check, Kruuk says nothing about the magic shortsword or his illegal business.": "与克鲁克用盗贼的口吻交谈或成功通过DC15魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查的角色会得到他的信任，他就会透露最近有一把 \"魔法短剑 \"落入他的手中，他计划今晚晚些时候将其出售（见下文\"{@area A Deal Goes Down|256|x}\"）。如果人物表示有兴趣购买这把武器，克鲁克会要求他们等到买家到来，然后他将把剑卖给出价最高的人。如果人物没有通过检查，克鲁克就不会说任何关于魔法短剑和他的非法生意的事情。",
	"Kruuk's bedroom contains a writing desk and chair, a mattress on the floor, shelves covered with personal belongings, and a pair of 25-pound dumbbells.

	"In the center of Kruuk's property is a grass-covered courtyard. It has wooden doors leading to all four rooms surrounding it. These doors are locked, but any of them can be opened by using a key Kruuk keeps on his person.

	"The lockbox holds the {@item ruidium shortsword|CRCotN} that Kruuk plans to sell (see \"A Deal Goes Down\" below). If the characters have gained Kruuk's trust, he opens the lockbox to show them the sword, then explains its magical properties (see {@adventure appendix B|CRCotN|9|{@item Ruidium Weapon|CRCotN}}).": "箱子里放着克鲁克计划出售的{@item ruidium shortsword|CRCotN}(见下文 \"交易进行中\")。如果人物获得了克鲁克的信任，他就会打开锁箱给他们看这把剑，然后解释它的魔法特性（见{@adventure appendix B|CRCotN|9|{@item Ruidium Weapon|CRCotN}}）。",
	"If {@creature Ashann|CRCotN} has been taken out of the equation, a character can convince Kruuk to sell the shortsword for 500 gp by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation} or {@skill Persuasion}) check, either by threatening his life or by convincing him that the characters are interested in being repeat customers.": "如果{@creature Ashann|CRCotN}已经被排除，一个角色可以通过DC14魅力({@skill Intimidation}或{@skill Persuasion})检查成功说服克鲁克以500金币出售短剑，要么威胁他的生命，要么让他相信角色有兴趣成为回头客。",
	"The characters can wait to snatch the {@item ruidium shortsword|CRCotN} from {@creature Ashann|CRCotN} after her deal with Kruuk is done, in which case {@creature Ashann|CRCotN} tries to flee with the sword rather than fight, resulting in a chase (use the {@book chase rules|DMG|8|Chases} and the {@table Urban Chase Complications} table in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}). If {@creature Ashann|CRCotN} is caught, she fights to keep the {@item ruidium shortsword|CRCotN} but surrenders it if she is reduced to 10 hit points or fewer.": "人物可以在她与克鲁克的交易完成后，等待从{@creature Ashann|CRCotN}那里抢夺{@item ruidium shortsword|CRCotN}，在这种情况下，{@creature Ashann|CRCotN}试图带着剑逃跑，而不是战斗，结果是追击（使用{@book chase rules|DMG|8|Chases}和{@table Urban Chase Complications}表中的{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}）。如果{@creature Ashann|CRCotN}被抓，她会奋力保住{@item ruidium shortsword|CRCotN}，但如果她的命中率降到10点或更低，就会交出它。",
	"Iwo is happy to receive the {@item ruidium shortsword|CRCotN} and hands over the agreed-upon reward in exchange for it. Iwo is careful not to touch the weapon bare-handed. (After examining the sword carefully for a few days, the monks of the Cobalt Soul destroy it to ensure that it doesn't corrupt anyone.) If the characters seem reluctant to part with the sword, Iwo warns them that the weapon might be dangerous to its wielder. If necessary, Iwo increases the reward to 1,000 gp, hoping the extra coin will convince the characters to part with the weapon.": "伊沃很高兴收到{@item ruidium shortsword|CRCotN}，并交出了约定的奖励以换取它。伊沃小心翼翼，不敢赤手空拳地触摸这把武器。(在仔细检查了这把剑几天后，钴之魂的僧侣们销毁了它，以确保它不会腐蚀任何人）。如果角色们似乎不愿意放弃这把剑，伊沃警告他们，这把武器可能会对持剑者造成危险。如果有必要，伊沃会将奖励提高到1000金币，希望额外的硬币能说服人物放弃武器。",

In those days, it was home to elves of all kinds—including those who were transformed into Exandria's first orcs by the blood of Gruumsh the Ruiner after Corellon pierced his eye on the field of battle.

	"Cael Morrow, the Drowned City, is the grave of thousands of Gruumsh's victims. Even Alyxian's sacrifice, which protected much of the land of Marquet at the cost of his freedom, could not save the city. Now, the center of Cael Morrow is a planar rift born from the place where Gruumsh's spear struck the earth. This rift is the gateway to the Netherdeep, the fountainhead of the corrupting element ruidium, and an object of fascination to Ank'Harel's factions. The rift will draw the characters and their rivals into conflict once more—with the chance to become heroes.": "淹没之城Cael Morrow是成千上万格鲁姆什受害者的坟墓。即使是阿莱克斯安的牺牲，以他的自由为代价保护了马奎特的大部分土地，也无法拯救这座城市。现在，凯尔-莫罗的中心是一个平面裂缝，诞生于格鲁姆什的长矛击打大地的地方。这个裂缝是通往Netherdeep的大门，是腐蚀元素Ruidium的源头，也是Ank'Harel各派别的一个迷恋对象。这条裂缝将把人物和他们的对手再次卷入冲突--有机会成为英雄。",
	"This chapter contains a description of the ruins of Cael Morrow, which the characters explore over the course of the various faction missions detailed in the previous chapter. These missions, which differ depending on which faction the characters have allied themselves with, form the story of this chapter.

But if they need a push to enter the Netherdeep, the missions in {@adventure chapter 4|CRCotN|4} can help motivate them.": "本章包含了对凯尔-莫罗（Cael Morrow）废墟的描述，人物在前一章详述的各种派别任务过程中对其进行了探索。这些任务因人物与哪个派别结盟而不同，构成了本章的故事。这些任务对于推进冒险情节并不是必须的；如果角色想拯救Alyxian并进入Netherdeep，他们可以不经派系的提示而这样做。但如果他们需要一个推动力来进入Netherdeep，{@adventure chapter 4|CRCotN|4}的任务可以帮助激励他们。",

Irvan fears that any further mistake could cost him his life—permanently.": "{@creature Irvan Wastewalker (Tier 3)|CRCotN|Irvan Wastewalker}. 当他在凯尔-莫罗（Cael Morrow）与滑行血鳍的战斗中失去手臂时，艾文的骑士风度消失了。他的派别盟友为他安装了一个时尚而实用的奥术假肢，但这次与死亡的擦肩而过使他变得脾气暴躁、小心翼翼和不信任。欧文担心，任何进一步的错误都会使他永久地失去生命。",
	"{@creature Maggie Keeneyes (Tier 3)|CRCotN|Maggie Keeneyes}. A deep melancholy has taken root in Maggie's heart. She continues the mission out of love for Ayo, but she fears that her leader's determination might not be enough to achieve victory. Maggie doesn't trust the Allegiance of Allsight agents in Cael Morrow (even if the rivals have allied with that faction), believing them to be influenced by a malevolent force. She has shared her misgivings about this organization with Ayo on several occasions.": "{@creature Maggie Keeneyes (Tier 3)|CRCotN|Maggie Keeneyes}. 一种深深的忧郁在麦琪的心中扎下了根。出于对阿尤的爱，她继续执行任务，但她担心她的领导人的决心可能不足以取得胜利。玛姬不相信卡奥-莫罗（Cael Morrow）的Allsight特工（即使对手已经与该派别结盟），认为他们受到一股邪恶力量的影响。她曾多次与阿尤分享她对这个组织的疑虑。",
	"The rivals have become affiliated with a faction of your choice, most likely the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream.

	"A good time for the characters to encounter the rivals is when the characters try to leave Cael Morrow with something valuable in their possession, such as the Key to the Netherdeep (see the faction story tracks in {@adventure chapter 4|CRCotN|4}) or the {@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN} in its {@item Jewel of Three Prayers (Exalted)|CRCotN|Exalted State} (see {@area area M9|2ad|x}).": "角色遇到对手的好时机是当角色试图带着有价值的东西离开Cael Morrow时，例如Netherdeep的钥匙（见{@adventure chapter 4|CRCotN|4}中的派系故事轨道）或其{@item Jewel of Three Prayers (Exalted)|CRCotN|Exalted State}中的{@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN}（见{@area area M9|2ad|x}）。",
	"If the characters get the better of the rivals in this chapter, you can use the rivals' defeat to change the pace of the exploration of the Netherdeep in the next chapter.

	"Rare are the things that remain beautiful after their deaths—Cael Morrow is one of them. Through the efforts of the Allegiance of Allsight, portions of the sunken city have been reclaimed and magically warded against the pervasive deluge.

	"Despite these efforts, though, Cael Morrow remains a largely inhospitable place. Otherworldly aquatic creatures thrive in the ruins, some adapted to and warped by the impenetrable darkness and others aberrant growths spawned in the Netherdeep. To make matters worse, the spirits of the dead and the damned from the Calamity long ago still haunt the wreckage of the city.": "尽管有这些努力，但卡奥-莫罗仍然是一个基本上不适宜居住的地方。其他世界的水生生物在废墟中茁壮成长，有些适应并扭曲了不可逾越的黑暗，有些则是在尼瑟斯底层产生的反常生长。更糟糕的是，很久以前的灾难中的死者和被诅咒者的灵魂仍然在城市的残骸中出没。",

	"One ounce of ruidium can be substituted for 500 gp worth of any material component needed to cast a spell. A creature that casts a spell using ruidium as a replacement component must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or gain 1 level of {@condition exhaustion} after the spell is cast.

Both have olive skin and wear simple, dirt-stained garments made of a single piece of cloth. Their attackers are shadowy, faceless facsimiles of people draped in worn-out clothes. Red eyes burn from beneath their wide-brimmed hats. These shadowy assailants use the {@creature berserker} stat block, but their weapon attacks deal psychic damage.

I don't know if a curse truly follows you—but people believe it does, and that's enough for them.\" The characters then hear Alyxian whisper the following words: \"I have watched Saqiri's death a thousand times.

	"After the first wave is defeated, the characters have 2 rounds to heal and prepare for the second wave: two {@creature Moorbounder|EGW|moorbounders} (see {@adventure appendix A|CRCotN|8}) accompanied by five {@creature Sword Wraith Warrior|MPMM|sword wraith warriors}. Before the characters can do anything to prevent it, the sword wraiths merge into one creature—a {@creature slithering bloodfin|CRCotN} (see {@adventure appendix A|CRCotN|8}) that swims through the air as easily as it normally swims through water. The howling faces of the warriors are visible on the bloodfin's flesh. The bloodfin is not what the Apotheon sought to conjure in this moment; rather, it represents Alyxian's inability to keep the Netherdeep from intruding upon his memories.": "在击败第一波敌人后，角色们有2轮时间来治疗和准备迎接第二波敌人：两个{@creature Moorbounder|EGW|moorbounders} (见{@adventure appendix A|CRCotN|8}) 伴随着五个{@creature Sword Wraith Warrior|MPMM|sword wraith warriors}。在角色们能够采取任何行动来阻止之前，剑鬼融合成了一个生物——一个{@creature slithering bloodfin|CRCotN} (见{@adventure appendix A|CRCotN|8})，它在空中游动就像在水中游动一样轻松。战士们嚎叫的面孔可在血鳍兽的肌肤上看到。血鳍兽并不是阿波西翁在这一刻试图召唤的东西；相反，它代表了阿利西安无法阻止幽冥深渊侵入他记忆的无能。",
	"After the second wave is defeated, the characters have 1 round to heal and prepare for the final wave: a {@creature sword wraith commander|MPMM} and four {@creature Sword Wraith Warrior|MPMM|sword wraith warriors} on the back of a {@creature horizonback tortoise|EGW} (see {@adventure appendix A|CRCotN|8} for these creatures' stat blocks). Alyxian shares his thoughts as the tortoise lumbers toward the party:": "在击败第二波敌人后，角色们有1轮时间来治疗和准备迎接最后一波敌人：一只{@creature sword wraith commander|MPMM}和四只{@creature Sword Wraith Warrior|MPMM|sword wraith warriors}骑在一只{@creature horizonback tortoise|EGW}的背上（参见{@adventure appendix A|CRCotN|8}中这些生物的属性块）。当乌龟缓慢地朝着队伍走来时，Alyxian分享了他的想法：",
	"When the commander drops to 0 hit points, it lets out a terrible scream, and any remaining sword wraith warriors flee on their next turn. When the tortoise drops to 0 hit points, it falls {@condition prone} and lets out one last shudder before expiring. The characters are victorious when both the commander and the tortoise are slain.": "当指挥官的生命值降至0点时，它发出一声可怕的尖叫，任何剩余的剑鬼战士会在它们的下一个回合逃跑。当乌龟的生命值降至0点时，它倒下{@condition prone}，在断气前发出最后一丝颤抖。只有当指挥官和乌龟都被击败时，角色们才算取得胜利。",
	"When all three waves of foes are defeated, Alyxian's allies cheer as the enemy is routed. A {@creature veteran} covered in blood limps toward the characters and says, \"You won the day, brave Alyxian. My wounds burn, but if you command it, I will follow you to the end.\" Alyxian whispers an answer that only the characters can hear: \"It never ends.\" The wounded soldier, named Talmyth, has 1 hit point. If a character heals him, that act has a positive effect on the final battle against Alyxian (see \"{@area Emotional Healing|3be|x}\" in {@adventure chapter 7|CRCotN|7}).": "当所有三波敌人被击败时，(%Alyxian%)的盟友们欢呼，敌人被击溃。 一个浑身是血的{@creature veteran}向角色们蹒跚而来，说道：“你们赢得了这一天，勇敢的(%Alyxian%)。我的伤口灼烧着，但如果你下令，我会跟随你到最后。” (%Alyxian%)低声回答，只有角色们能听见：“永无止境。” 这名受伤的士兵名叫塔尔米斯，只剩下1点生命值。如果有角色治愈了他，这个行为将对最后与(%Alyxian%)的战斗产生积极影响（见{@adventure chapter 7|CRCotN|7}中的“{@area Emotional Healing|3be|x}”）。",
	"Once the battle has ended and the scene with Talmyth has played out, the characters are returned to the underwater grotto. At the same time, two secret doors open in the north wall (see \"{@area Secret Doors|32e|x}\" earlier in the chapter). Behind one secret door is a narrow, dimly lit tunnel that connects to area N7a; behind the other is {@area area N8|336|x}.": "一旦战斗结束并与塔尔米斯的场景发生，角色们会被带回水下的岩洞。与此同时，北墙上的两扇秘密门打开了（见本章前面的“{@area Secret Doors|32e|x}”）。其中一扇秘密门后是一条狭窄昏暗的隧道，通往N7a区域；另一扇门后是{@area area N8|336|x}。",
	"The mote of light above the pedestal is the Fragment of Pity (see \"{@adventure Fragments of Suffering|CRCotN|6|Appendix D: Fragments of Suffering}\" earlier in the chapter). When a character touches the mote, it disappears and becomes part of the character's soul. When this happens, all the characters receive a fleeting vision (see the {@area Apotheon Lore table|2de|x} earlier in the chapter).": "台座上方的光点是怜悯碎片(见本章前文\"{@adventure Fragments of Suffering|CRCotN|6|Appendix D: Fragments of Suffering}\")。当角色触碰这个光点时，它会消失并融入角色的灵魂。在这种情况下，所有角色都会收到一个瞬间的幻象(见本章前文\"{@area Apotheon Lore table|2de|x}\")。",
	"The wooden chest is closed and unlocked. It contains four stoppered {@item Potion of Greater Healing||potions of healing (greater)} in red crystal vials and a fully charged {@item wand of secrets}. If the rivals reach this area before the characters do, Dermot takes the magic items and doesn't bother closing the chest after emptying it.": "木制箱子是关闭的，但没有锁。里面装有四个封好塞子的红水晶瓶{@item Potion of Greater Healing||potions of healing (greater)}和一个充能饱满的{@item wand of secrets}。如果敌对势力在角色之前到达这个区域，德莫特会拿走这些魔法物品，并在清空箱子后不再费心关闭它。",
	"Two tunnels, one to the north and one to the south, lead away from this chamber. The south tunnel heads to area N7. The north tunnel is longer, descends almost vertically to {@area area N16|364|x}, and is dimly lit by red light emanating from that location. Each tunnel ends at a secret door (see \"{@area Secret Doors|32e|x}\" earlier in the chapter). A creature leaving this location automatically finds either secret door.": "两条隧道，一条通往北方，一条通往南方，从这个房间通往外面。南方隧道通往N7区域。北方隧道更长，几乎垂直下降到{@area area N16|364|x}，被那个地点发出的红光昏暗地照亮。每条隧道都通往一个秘密门（请参见本章前面的“{@area Secret Doors|32e|x}”）。离开这个地点的生物会自动找到其中一个秘密门。",
	"Every character in the grotto and any character who enters the grotto while the manifestation of the Betrayer God is present falls {@condition prone} on the floor and has their speed reduced to 0 by the force of the Betrayer God's spear, as though the character were being impaled by it. No force, magical or otherwise, can move a character from the space in which they fall {@condition prone}.": "在洞穴中的每个角色以及在背叛者之神的显现期间进入洞穴的任何角色都会倒地并且速度被减为0，就好像角色被背叛者之神的矛刺穿一样。无论是什么力量，无论是魔法还是其他方式，都无法将角色从他们倒下的位置移开。",
	"Alyxian whispers in the mind of the first character to succeed on three saves, saying, \"Perhaps you will be remembered. Now, what about your companions?\" That character can take the {@action Help} action to speak words of encouragement to other characters still trapped by the spear, granting them advantage on the next saving throw they make to resist it.": "Alyxian在第一个成功通过三次豁免检定的角色心中低语道：“也许你会被记住。那么，你的同伴呢？”那个角色可以采取{@action Help}行动，对仍被长矛困住的其他角色说出鼓励的话语，使他们在下次抵抗长矛的豁免检定中获得优势。",
	"The characters can enter this chamber by stepping through the open doorway in the south wall after surviving the attack in area N8. Hidden in the north wall is a secret door that leads to {@area area N26|3a9|x} (see \"{@area Secret Doors|32e|x}\" earlier in the chapter).": "角色可以通过在南墙上的敞开门道踏入这个房间，这是在N8区域的攻击中幸存下来后的。隐藏在北墙上的是一扇秘密门，通往{@area area N26|3a9|x}（请参见本章前面的“{@area Secret Doors|32e|x}”）。",
	"If a character speaks out against the Apotheon a third time in the Vents of Fury, the Apotheon bellows, \"So be it. You too shall know the suffering of betrayal.\" Sludgy ichor oozes out from the character's skin and coalesces, taking the form of a {@creature cloaker} whose face resembles that of someone the character loves or thinks of fondly. This cloaker has the following changes to its stat block:": "如果一个角色在愤怒通风口第三次发表反对阿波西翁的言论，阿波西翁会咆哮道：“既然如此。你也将体验背叛的痛苦。” 黏稠的粘液从角色的皮肤中渗出并凝聚，形成一个{@creature cloaker}，其面孔酷似角色所热爱或深思的某人。这个披风怪具有以下对其属性块的更改：",
	"The cloaker attacks the character, ignoring all other creatures. When either the cloaker or its target drops to 0 hit points, the cloaker disappears in a vermilion haze that fills its space and disperses after 1 minute. The area within the haze is {@quickref Vision and Light|PHB|2||lightly obscured}.": "披风兽袭击角色，无视其他所有生物。当披风兽或其目标中的任何一方的生命值降至0时，披风兽会在一个朱红色的薄雾中消失，填满其所在的空间，并在1分钟后消散。薄雾范围内为{@quickref Vision and Light|PHB|2||lightly obscured}。",
	"In the distance, a {@creature slithering bloodfin|CRCotN} chases a {@creature swarm of sorrowfish|CRCotN} (see {@adventure appendix A|CRCotN|8} for these creatures' stat blocks). A character who isn't carrying a light source can move around in the flooded cavern without attracting the attention of these creatures by succeeding on a DC 14 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check. If the check fails or the character makes no attempt to hide, the bloodfin notices and attacks the intruder. The sorrowfish are attracted to blood and attack any creature in the cavern that is wounded, including the bloodfin.": "在远处，一只{@creature slithering bloodfin|CRCotN}追逐一只{@creature swarm of sorrowfish|CRCotN}（查看{@adventure appendix A|CRCotN|8}以获取这些生物的属性块）。如果角色没有携带光源，可以通过成功进行一次DC 14的敏捷({@skill Stealth})检定，在洪水淹没的洞穴中移动而不会引起这些生物的注意。如果检定失败或角色没有试图隐藏，血鳍鱼会注意到并攻击入侵者。悲伤鱼被血液吸引，并攻击洞穴中受伤的任何生物，包括血鳍鱼。",
	"Hidden in the north wall is a secret door (see \"{@area Secret Doors|32e|x}\" earlier in the chapter). On the other side of the secret door is a narrow passage that climbs steeply and ends before another secret door that opens into {@area area N19|37e|x}.
