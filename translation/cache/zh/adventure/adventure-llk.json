	"The legendary inventor Kwalish disappeared eons ago... as it turns out, finding a crashed planar ship and studying its technology to fuel his own experiments. Only now, Kwalish's lost research is desperately needed! Will you dare an alternate expedition into the Barrier Peaks to find him?": "传说中的发明家Kwalish在几个世纪前就消失了......事实证明，他找到了一艘坠毁的星球飞船，并研究其技术以推动自己的实验。只是现在，Kwalish遗失的研究被急切地需要！你是否敢于另辟蹊径，进入壁垒探险？你是否敢于另辟蹊径，进入壁垒峰寻找他？",
	"As a special offering in support of Extra Life 2018, we're pleased to present the following adventure scenario, built around a new expedition to the legendary Barrier Peaks. This adventure is suitable for characters of 5th to 10th level.": "作为支持《额外生活》2018年的特别奉献，我们很高兴地介绍以下冒险场景，它是围绕着对传奇的屏障峰的新探险而建立的。这个冒险适用于5到10级的角色。",
	"In centuries long past, a common scholar named Kwalish took an unlikely path to becoming one of the most powerful arcane inventors of all time, after his discovery of strange magic in the Barrier Peaks. His studies of an ancient, crashed planar craft set him on a path that might have seen him rival Ioun and Heward—until his experiments overtook him, and he became lost to the ages. All that's left of his legacy is a single example of his earliest work—the {@item Apparatus of Kwalish} that is the only way most folk now know his name.": "在很久以前的几个世纪里，一个名叫Kwalish的普通学者在屏障之峰发现了奇怪的魔法之后，走上了一条不可能的道路，成为有史以来最强大的奥术发明家之一。他对一个古老的、坠毁的平面飞行器的研究使他走上了一条可能与伊昂和休沃德相抗衡的道路--直到他的实验超越了他，而他也迷失在了岁月中。他的遗产只剩下他最早的作品的一个例子--{@item Apparatus of Kwalish}，这是大多数人现在知道他名字的唯一途径。",
	"It was Kwalish's foray into the Barrier Peaks that set his advanced studies into motion, when he joined an ill-fated expedition in search of Daoine Gloine, a legendary city said to be populated by creatures of glass. Though the rest of his party perished along the way, Kwalish stumbled upon a wrecked planar craft of unknown providence and spent years exploring its secrets. He even repurposed much of the craft's unique magical technology into his first laboratory, building planar gates of his own design.": "夸里什进入壁垒峰，开始了他的高级研究，当时他加入了一个命运多舛的探险队，寻找Daoine Gloine，一个传说中由玻璃生物居住的城市。虽然他的队伍中的其他人在途中丧生，但夸里什偶然发现了一艘残破的平面飞船，并花了数年时间探索其秘密。他甚至将这艘飞船的大部分独特的魔法技术重新用于他的第一个实验室，建造他自己设计的平面门。",
	"Testing one such gate as it forged a connection to the Nine Hells attracted the attention of a bone devil. Trailing Kwalish back across the planes, the devil took over the inventor's laboratory for itself. Kwalish managed to escape but left much of his lore behind, while the bone devil spent the years that followed converting the place into a dark monastery—and establishing its own cult.": "测试一个这样的门，因为它与九层地狱建立了联系，吸引了一个骨魔的注意。追踪Kwalish回到各个星球，骨魔为自己占领了这位发明家的实验室。夸里什成功逃脱，但留下了他的大部分理论，而骨魔则在随后的几年里将这里改造成了一个黑暗的修道院，并建立了自己的邪教。",
	"After much wandering in the mountains, Kwalish relocated to an equally remote location—Daoine Gloine, the mysterious city his expedition had originally sought. The site's isolation made it a suitable place for him to continue his research. However, its populace turned out not to be creatures of glass as the legends suggested, but clans of kenku that worshipped a medusa with the unique ability to transform her victims into glass.": "在山里徘徊了很久之后，夸里什搬到了一个同样偏远的地方--道恩-格洛因，那是他的探险队最初寻找的神秘城市。这个地方与世隔绝，是一个适合他继续研究的地方。然而，这里的居民并不像传说中的那样是玻璃生物，而是崇拜一个具有将受害者变成玻璃的独特能力的美杜莎的肯库部族。",
	"Before Kwalish could be made to suffer the same fate at the hands of the chaotic kenku and their mad medusa, he once more opened a planar gate, this time to the 222nd layer of the Abyss—Juiblex's Slime Pits, from which he summoned forth a horrific plague of ooze to clear out the city and help him defend his new lab.": "在夸里什被混乱的肯库和他们疯狂的美杜莎弄得遭受同样的命运之前，他再次打开了一道平面门，这次是通往深渊的第222层--吉布利克斯的粘液坑，他从那里召唤出了可怕的粘液瘟疫来清除城市，帮助他保卫他的新实验室。",
	"Kwalish cut off all access to Daoine Gloine, and the city was lost to the ages. The legendary inventor has not been heard from since. Only now, the characters are in dire need of his aid...": "夸里什切断了所有通往道恩-格洛因的通道，而这座城市也消失在岁月中。从此，这位传奇的发明家就没有了消息。只是现在，这些人物急需他的帮助......",
	"In 2017, the D&D team added several projects to the DMs Guild in support of Extra Life (including One Grung Above, The Lost Kenku, and The Tortle Package). The funds raised from the sale of these packages went to this extremely worthy cause—and for 2018, you'll find even more projects made available on the DMs Guild throughout the year. As part of these efforts, it's our privilege to contribute the following adventure to the cause. We wanted to provide as much value for your donation as we could, providing new maps, monsters, and magic items—and of course, the scenario itself, accompanied by a range of notes and options to help cater to your preferred play style. We hope you enjoy Lost Laboratory of Kwalish. And you have our sincere thanks for your support of Extra Life and Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.": "2017年，D&D团队在DMs公会中增加了几个项目以支持Extra Life（包括One Grung Above、The Lost Kenku和The Tortle Package）。出售这些套餐所筹集的资金用于这一极其有意义的事业--而在2018年，你会发现全年在DMs公会上有更多的项目。作为这些努力的一部分，我们很荣幸地将以下冒险活动贡献给这项事业。我们希望为您的捐赠提供尽可能多的价值，提供新的地图、怪物和魔法物品--当然还有剧情本身，伴随着一系列的注释和选项，以帮助迎合您喜欢的游戏风格。我们希望你能喜欢《失落的Kwalish实验室》。我们衷心感谢您对《额外生命》和儿童奇迹网络医院的支持。",
	"The characters are charged with locating Kwalish's long-lost laboratory and the magical technology that might be found there. As they start their search, they're first directed to an accomplished gnome map merchant named Anaxi Zephries, known as \"the Cartophile.\" Information collected by Anaxi over the years has traced Kwalish's route into the Barrier Peaks—at least up to the point where his expedition was lost, despite its members' formidable knowledge and skill.": "这些人物负责寻找Kwalish失落已久的实验室和可能在那里发现的魔法技术。当他们开始搜索时，他们首先被引导到一个名叫Anaxi Zephries的有成就的地精地图商人那里，他被称为 \"制图者\"。Anaxi多年来收集的信息追踪了Kwalish进入屏障峰的路线--至少到他的探险队迷失的那一刻为止，尽管其成员拥有强大的知识和技能。",
	"Working their own way into the Barrier Peaks, the characters eventually arrive at Kwalish's first laboratory—the remains of a planar craft whose technology drove the inventor's early research. But they discover that Kwalish has long since been exiled, and his lab converted into a monastery now dedicated to the bone devil that is the site's Grand Master. The characters must negotiate their entrance into the monastery, and from there to its treasury. Hidden within the treasury are notes from Kwalish's original expedition that lead to Daoine Gloine, the legendary city deep within the Barrier Peaks—and the site of Kwalish's current laboratory.": "角色们通过自己的方式进入屏障峰，最终到达了Kwalish的第一个实验室--一个平面飞行器的遗迹，其技术推动了这位发明家的早期研究。但是他们发现Kwalish早就被流放了，他的实验室被改造成了一座修道院，现在供奉的是该地的大法师--骨魔。角色们必须通过谈判进入修道院，并从那里进入其库房。库房里藏着夸里什最初的探险笔记，这些笔记通往道恩-格洛因（Daoine Gloine），那是位于屏障之峰深处的传奇城市，也是夸里什目前的实验室所在地。",
	"After reaching Daoine Gloine, the characters find the city buried beneath a flood of gelatinous ooze, with only its tallest stone structures left rising above the surface. The characters must find a safe means of descent into the ooze as they seek the entrance to Kwalish's hidden laboratory—and avoid the empty city's deadly guardians. Once they reach the lab, the characters meet with the legendary inventor and can negotiate for the assistance necessary to complete their quest—and they might even have the chance to help Kwalish deal with one of a number of problems of his own.": "在到达Daoine Gloine之后，角色们发现这座城市被埋在胶状渗出物的洪流之下，只有最高的石头建筑耸立在表面。角色们必须找到一个安全的方法，让他们能够安全地下降到渗出物中，同时寻找Kwalish隐藏的实验室的入口--避免空城的致命守护者。一旦他们到达实验室，角色们就会见到这位传奇的发明家，并可以通过谈判获得完成任务所需的援助--他们甚至有机会帮助Kwalish处理他自己的一些问题。",
	"The original Expedition to the Barrier Peaks—1980's adventure module S3 for first edition AD&D—placed its titular mountains in Greyhawk, north of the Grand Duchy of Geoff and the Valley of the Mage. Depending on your campaign, you can set this adventure in any similar location: a mysterious mountain range that even dedicated explorers have failed to fully map. In the Forgotten Realms, one possible location for the adventure is Chult, the land explored in Tomb of Annihilation. The mysterious and poorly mapped peninsula contains several suitable mountain ranges, including the Mistcliffs and the Kobold Mountains. Elsewhere in Faerûn, the peaks surrounding Halruaa, a land known for its magical technology, are a good choice. Alternatively, campaigns making use of the {@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH} adventure might look for a location closer to the city, including the Greypeaks or the Nether Mountains.": "最初的《屏障之峰远征》--1980年第一版AD&D的冒险模块S3--将其名下的山脉放在格雷霍克，位于杰夫大公国和法师谷的北部。根据你的活动，你可以把这个冒险放在任何类似的地方：一个神秘的山脉，即使是专门的探险家也未能完全描绘出来。在被遗忘的领域，一个可能的冒险地点是楚尔特，即《毁灭之墓》中探索的土地。这个神秘且地图绘制不全的半岛上有几条合适的山脉，包括雾崖和哥布林山脉。在Faerûn的其他地方，以魔法技术著称的Halruaa周围的山峰也是一个不错的选择。另外，利用{@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH}冒险的活动可以寻找一个离城市更近的地方，包括Greypeaks或Nether山脉。",
	"Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.": "出现在这样的方框中的文字是为了让玩家在他们的角色第一次到达某个地点或在某个特定情况下大声朗读或转述，如文中所述。",
	"This adventure features numerous encounters and challenges that should keep a group entertained for multiple sessions. However, you can easily run a shorter version of the adventure, or even an exciting one-shot, by making the following modifications:": "这个冒险的特点是有许多遭遇和挑战，应该能让一个小组在多个环节中保持娱乐。然而，你可以通过以下的修改，轻松地运行一个较短的冒险版本，甚至是一个令人兴奋的单次拍摄。",
	"Run the adventure as written, making use of both the monastery and the ooze-flooded city locations.": "按规定进行冒险，同时利用修道院和水灾城市的地点。",
	" Run the adventure as written, up to the monastery. Then forgo a second laboratory location, instead replacing the final brain in a jar in the treasury (area M10) with Kwalish, and conclude the adventure there": " 按规定进行冒险，一直到修道院。然后放弃第二个实验室的位置，而用库房（M10区）的罐子里的最后一个大脑替换掉Kwalish，并在那里结束冒险。",
	"Give your players an adventure hook, assign them a guide (see \"{@adventure Part 1: Mission to the Barrier Peaks|LLK|1}\"), and start them at {@area C1|032}, overlooking the bone devil's monastery. Then as above, replace the treasury's brain in a jar with Kwalish for an exciting conclusion.": "给你的玩家一个冒险的钩子，给他们分配一个向导（见\"{@adventure Part 1: Mission to the Barrier Peaks|LLK|1}\"），然后让他们在{@area C1|032}开始，俯瞰骨魔的修道院。然后如上所述，用Kwalish取代宝库里的大脑，以获得一个令人兴奋的结论。",
	"In the course of previous adventures, the characters might have come up against a special magical-mechanical dilemma too challenging to overcome. Perhaps a secret door in a dungeon complex has been built around an iron golem, or an array of dangerous clockwork devices discovered within a city defy any attempts to turn them off. All research into the problem suggests that the inventor Kwalish might have the solution—if only he hadn't gone missing years before.": "在以前的冒险过程中，人物可能会遇到一个特殊的魔法-机械困境，难以克服。也许地牢里的一扇秘密大门是围绕着一个铁制傀儡建造的，或者在一个城市里发现的一系列危险的发条装置无视任何试图将其关闭的尝试。对这个问题的所有研究表明，发明家Kwalish可能有解决方案--如果他没有在几年前失踪的话。",
	"Alternatively, you might consider any of the following hooks. Several involve a pending crisis, such that the players are seeking Kwalish not just on their own behalf, but to prevent hardship to friends, family, or the common folk. Just make sure that the peril doesn't come on too quickly, though, as an expedition into the Barrier Peaks will take some time.": "另外，你可以考虑以下任何一种钩子。其中有几个涉及到即将发生的危机，比如玩家不仅是为了自己的利益，也是为了防止朋友、家人或普通人陷入困境而寻找Kwalish。但要确保危险不会来得太快，因为对壁垒山峰的探险需要一些时间。",
	"If you're playing through or using events from {@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA} in your campaign, the characters might hear rumors that Kwalish's laboratory holds lore that can help deactivate the Soulmonger. If the characters have any hope of surviving the tomb and ending the death curse, they must first make the dangerous journey to the inventor's lost lab.": "如果你在你的战役中通过或使用{@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA}的事件，角色们可能会听到传言说Kwalish的实验室拥有可以帮助解除灵魂使者的传说。如果角色们有任何希望从坟墓中幸存下来并结束死亡诅咒，他们必须首先进行危险的旅程，前往发明家丢失的实验室。",
	"Alternatively, in the aftermath of a {@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA} campaign, a friend, family member, or mentor important to the characters might have been placed in stasis within a magical sarcophagus to protect them from the death curse. With the curse lifted, this NPC can now be saved—except the sarcophagus cannot be opened by any magical or mundane means. After learning that the sarcophagus is one of Kwalish's designs, the characters must seek out his lost laboratory for the means to open it—or their friend will sleep for eternity.": "另外，在{@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA}战役结束后，一个对角色很重要的朋友、家人或导师可能被放置在一个魔法石棺里，以保护他们不受死亡诅咒的影响。随着诅咒的解除，这个NPC现在可以被拯救了--但石棺不能用任何魔法或世俗的方法打开。在得知石棺是Kwalish的设计之一后，角色们必须寻找他丢失的实验室以获得打开石棺的方法，否则他们的朋友将永远沉睡。",
	"A number of hooks can connect to the exploits of characters engaged in a {@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH} campaign. The famed walking statues of Waterdeep are showing signs of getting ready to power up once more, and not even the Blackstaff can shut them down. Old histories suggest that Kwalish's lore might hold the secrets of doing so, and the characters are sent to seek that lore out before the great magical statues can run amok.": "一些钩子可以连接到参与{@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH}活动的角色的探索。水底世界著名的行走雕像有准备再次发力的迹象，甚至连黑杖都无法关闭它们。古老的历史表明，Kwalish的传说可能蕴含着这样做的秘密，人物被派去寻找这个传说，以免伟大的魔法雕像横行。",
	"Alternatively, the grand parade of the Day of Wonders turns to deadly chaos when one of its inventive mechanical floats goes berserk and unleashes destruction across the city. After stopping the threat, the characters learn that it was built based on a Kwalish design, and that other such designs might be used to build great engines of destruction. The secrets to overcoming such inventions can be found only in Kwalish's lab.": "另外，奇迹日的盛大游行变成了致命的混乱，因为其中一个创造性的机械花车发狂了，并在整个城市释放了破坏。在阻止了这一威胁后，角色们了解到它是根据Kwalish的设计建造的，而其他这样的设计可能被用来建造伟大的毁灭引擎。克服这种发明的秘密只能在Kwalish的实验室里找到。",
	"As a more integral part of a {@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH} campaign, characters who successfully discover the location of the Vault of Dragons might discover that the keys needed to access it are lost. Rumors speak of another means of opening the vault—a secret known only to the lost inventor.": "作为{@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH}战役的一个重要组成部分，成功发现龙库位置的人物可能会发现，进入龙库所需的钥匙已经丢失。有传言说有另一种打开龙库的方法--只有失落的发明家才知道的秘密。",
	"If your campaign is set in the city world of Ravnica, as outlined in {@book Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica|GGR}, Kwalish might be a chemister from the Izzet League who left the guild to pursue his own work away from Niv-Mizzetr's prying eyes. Centuries later, Izzet researchers have uncovered some of Kwalish's notes. Desperate to locate the chemister's laboratory, the Izzet League reaches out to the characters to accomplish the task.": "如果你的战役设定在拉夫尼卡的城市世界，如{@book Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica|GGR}所述，Kwalish可能是Izzet联盟的一名化学家，他离开公会，远离Niv-Mizzetr的窥视，追求自己的工作。几个世纪后，伊泽特的研究人员发现了夸利什的一些笔记。由于急于找到化学家的实验室，伊泽特联盟向这些人物伸出援手，以完成这项任务。",
	"A massive magical-mechanical golem, an unknown planar vessel, or some other rare threat has appeared in civilized lands. Though local settlements are safe for the moment, the characters are charged with tracking down Kwalish and his laboratory in hopes that the secrets to disabling the imminent threat might be found there.": "一个巨大的魔法机械傀儡，一个未知的星球容器，或者其他一些罕见的威胁已经出现在文明的土地上。虽然当地的居民点暂时是安全的，但角色们负责追踪Kwalish和他的实验室，希望能在那里找到解除迫在眉睫的威胁的秘诀。",
	"A powerful marut (detailed in {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}) hunts one or more of the characters for breaking some cosmic contract. Their only hope of survival is to find Kwalish's laboratory, whose planar magic holds the means of restoring the balance the marut seeks to enforce.": "一个强大的马鲁特（详见{@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}）追捕一个或多个角色，因为他们违背了某种宇宙契约。他们唯一的生存希望是找到Kwalish的实验室，他的平面魔法拥有恢复马鲁特所寻求的平衡的手段。",
	"The characters are hired by a gnome sage known as the Cartophile for a mission of exploration, as he seeks to complete a failed expedition to Daoine Gloine undertaken by his ancestors. The characters must find their way to the lost city hidden within the Barrier Peaks, then return with its location.": "这些人物受雇于一位被称为 \"Cartophile \"的地精圣人，执行一项探索任务，因为他要完成他的祖先对Daoine Gloine的一次失败的探险。他们必须找到隐藏在壁垒山峰中的失落之城，然后带着它的位置返回。",
	"No matter what hook brings the characters into the adventure, any research into Kwalish's lost laboratory—or any NPC familiar with the inventor's failed expedition to the Barrier Peaks—establishes that seeking out the gnome known as the Cartophile is a crucial first step for their mission.": "无论什么样的钩子将角色带入冒险，对Kwalish丢失的实验室的任何研究--或者任何熟悉发明家对屏障山峰的失败探险的NPC--都会发现寻找被称为 \"嗜卡者 \"的地精是他们任务的关键第一步。",
	"Anaxi Zephries is a wealthy gnome merchant and sage. He is well known for his vast collection of maps, which cover the known world, pocket dimensions, routes across the planes, and more. In this role, the Cartophile has served as patron for numerous expeditions of exploration, sending adventurers to all corners of the world—both to draw new maps and to verify the authenticity of others already in his possession.": "阿纳西-泽弗里斯是一位富有的地精商人和圣人。他因收集了大量的地图而闻名，这些地图涵盖了已知的世界、袖珍空间、穿越位面的路线等等。在这个角色中，\"制图者 \"曾作为众多探险队的赞助人，将冒险者派往世界各个角落--既要绘制新的地图，又要验证他手中的其他地图的真实性。",
	"The gnome's collection contains notes and an initial map from the early stages of Kwalish's expedition into the Barrier Peaks. In exchange for allowing the characters to use that lore, he asks only that any further journals, notes, maps, and other documents from Kwalish's earlier expedition be returned to him.": "地精的收藏中包含了Kwalish对屏障之峰的早期探险的笔记和一张初始地图。作为允许角色使用这些传说的交换条件，他只要求将Kwalish早期探险中的任何其他日记、笔记、地图和其他文件归还给他。",
	"The Cartophile has no interest in adventuring, talking of how he once stood too close to a {@item Bag of Holding} accidentally placed within a {@item Portable Hole} and never fully recovered from it. However, in the interest of ensuring a successful mission, he offers the characters the services of a number of hirelings in his employ—and insists that at least one of those hirelings accompany the party, to serve as custodian of his maps and materials.": "嗜图者对冒险没有兴趣，他说他曾经站得太近，不小心把一个{@item Bag of Holding}放在了一个{@item Portable Hole}里面，然后就再也没有完全恢复过来。然而，为了确保任务的成功，他向人物提供了一些他雇佣的雇工的服务--并坚持要求这些雇工中至少有一个人随行，作为他的地图和资料的保管人。",
	"If the characters develop an especially close relationship to the Cartophile, the gnome might reveal that his professional career commissioning expeditions and maps has been background research for a personal obsession. One of his ancestors took part in Kwalish's lost expedition to find Daoine Gloine, the mythical city of the Barrier Peaks inhabited by \"people of glass.\" The gnome has long sought to learn the truth of the expedition's demise.": "如果人物与制图师建立了特别密切的关系，地精可能会透露，他委托探险和地图的职业生涯一直是个人痴迷的背景研究。他的一个祖先参加了Kwalish的失落的探险，以寻找Daoine Gloine，那个由 \"玻璃人 \"居住的壁垒山峰的神话城市。侏儒长期以来一直在寻求了解探险队灭亡的真相。",
	"Any of the following NPCs can join the party as custodians and translators of the materials loaned to the characters by the Cartophile. Each hireling is also charged with chronicling the party's progress along the way, in the hope of finally mapping the route to Daoine Gloine, and has specific value to the party in certain areas of expertise. However, each hireling also has one or more secret agendas that might work against the characters' interests.": "以下任何一个NPC都可以加入队伍，作为Cartophile借给人物的材料的保管人和翻译。每个雇佣兵都负责记录党派沿途的进展，希望最终绘制出通往道恩-格洛因的路线，并且在某些专业领域对党派有特殊价值。然而，每个雇工也有一个或多个秘密议程，可能会对人物的利益产生不利影响。",
	"You can let the party's size and the players' interest in bringing NPCs into their group determine whether more than one of the Cartophile's hirelings join the expedition. Or, instead of front-loading hirelings at the start, these NPCs can be set up as independent explorers not connected to the Cartophile. You can stagger their introduction throughout the course of the adventure (as suggested in each NPC's description below), with each one able to provide a useful next step to help the expedition along.": "你可以让队伍的规模和玩家对把NPC带入他们的队伍的兴趣来决定是否有超过一个嗜车者的雇佣者加入探险队。或者，这些NPC可以被设定为与嗜车者无关的独立探险者，而不是一开始就把雇佣者放在前面。你可以在整个冒险过程中错开介绍他们（正如下面每个NPC的描述中所建议的那样），每个人都可以提供一个有用的下一步来帮助探险队前进。",
	"Once a dwarven warrior, Ctenmiir was transformed into a {@creature Vampire} and hidden away within White Plume Mountain (see {@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP}) until captured there by an Emerald Enclave ranger. The vampire has long been imprisoned within a magical iron coffin mounted atop animated golem legs (an early Kwalish design), forced to atone for his evil deeds by working for the Cartophile.": "曾经是一名矮人战士的克滕米尔被改造成了一个{@creature Vampire}，藏在白翎山(见{@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP})里，直到被一名翡翠飞地的游侠抓住。长期以来，这个吸血鬼一直被囚禁在一个神奇的铁棺材里，铁棺材被安装在灵动的格木腿上（早期Kwalish设计），被迫通过为Cartophile工作来赎罪。",
	"Ctenmiir's coffin has a speed of 30 feet and a climbing speed of 10 feet, and protects the vampire from sunlight even as it prevents him from escaping his servitude. Though Ctenmiir is able to speak from within the coffin and help guide the expedition, the coffin obeys only the commands of the party members. Cold, calculating, and manipulative, the vampire aids the party as long as he believes he can earn his release from the coffin along the way—by any means possible.": "Ctenmiir的棺材有30英尺的速度和10英尺的攀爬速度，可以保护吸血鬼不受阳光照射，即使它阻止他逃脱他的奴役。虽然克滕米尔能够在棺材里说话并帮助指导探险，但棺材只听从党员的命令。吸血鬼冷酷无情、精打细算、善于操纵，只要他认为自己可以通过任何可能的方式从棺材中获得释放，他就会协助党的工作。",
	"Get out of the coffin. Feed on at least one character.": "从棺材里出来。至少以一个角色为食。",
	"If Ctenmiir does not start with the party, he might instead be found in the foothills, in the possession of outlaws seeking the monastery who use the vampire as their guide.": "如果克滕米尔没有和队伍一起出发，他可能会在山脚下被寻找修道院的歹徒占有，这些歹徒把吸血鬼当作他们的向导。",
	"If he joins the expedition from the start, the vampire might lead the characters to the foothills, then claim to no longer recognize the route ahead. He asks to be released so that he can scout more easily. But if he is, any promise of obedience he makes to the characters is ignored as he attacks them.": "如果他从一开始就加入探险队，吸血鬼可能会把人物带到山脚下，然后声称不再认识前方的路线。他要求被释放，以便他能更容易地侦察。但如果他被释放了，那么他对人物的任何服从的承诺都会被忽略，因为他在攻击他们。",
	"The Cartophile's first choice to join the characters' expedition, Garret is an untrustworthy bon vivant and magpie. His mapmaking skills are first rate, though, and the Cartophile trusts him to accurately detail the route to Daoine Gloine and sketch images of things discovered along the way. Garret claims that his infernal lineage goes back to Levistus (see {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}), and he keeps his horns adorned with rings, coins and other charms, some of which he claims are powerful magic items ready to be called on. See {@adventure appendix C|LLK|6} for Garret's stat block.": "Garret是Cartophile加入探险队的第一人选，他是一个不值得信任的生活家和喜鹊。不过他的地图制作技术是一流的，制图师相信他能准确地描述前往道恩-格洛因的路线，并勾画出沿途发现的事物的图像。Garret声称他的地狱血统可以追溯到Levistus（见{@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}），而且他的角上一直挂着戒指、硬币和其他符咒，他声称其中一些是强大的魔法物品，随时可以调用。加雷特的状态块见{@adventure appendix C|LLK|6}。",
	"Garret can draw the maps requested by the Cartophile. He also knows several rumors (both true and false) regarding the Barrier Peaks, and provides advantage to any characters' ability checks made to interact with the monastery's Grand Master.": "加雷特可以画出 \"制图师 \"要求的地图。他还知道一些关于壁垒峰的传言（有真有假），并为任何与寺院大法师互动的人物提供能力检查的优势。",
	"Steal the highest-valued object from the party without getting caught; convince as many characters as possible to sit for a sketch; and relay a secret communication to the Grand Master. This message takes the form of a written note from Garret's infernal patron, ordering the Grand Master to return to Stygia in the Nine Hells to complete a service required by Levistus. A forged addendum adds that the bearer of the note should be rewarded handsomely.": "在不被抓到的情况下偷取聚会中价值最高的物品；说服尽可能多的人物参加素描；并向大法师转达一个秘密通讯。这个信息的形式是加雷特的地狱赞助人的书面说明，命令大法师回到九层地狱的斯蒂吉亚，完成列维斯托斯要求的服务。一份伪造的附录补充说，纸条的持有者应该得到丰厚的回报。",
	"A simple and kindly {@creature Monodrone} modron, Gearbox has been sent as an agent of Mechanus to investigate Kwalish's works and experiments. Its mechanical body has been programmed with several unique utility powers (see below) that make the modron a perfect cartographer's assistant. If both Garret and Gearbox join the expedition, Gearbox assists the tiefling with his work, even as Garret delights in referring to the modron as \"Doohickey\", \"Contraption\", \"Thingamabob\", and so on.": "齿轮箱是一个简单而亲切的{@creature Monodrone}modron，作为Mechanus的代理人被派来调查Kwalish的作品和实验。它的机械身体已经被编入了几个独特的实用能力（见下文），使这个模子成为一个完美的制图师助手。如果加雷特和齿轮箱都加入了探险队，齿轮箱就会协助铁皮人完成他的工作，甚至加雷特还乐于把modron称为 \"Doohickey\"、\"Contraption\"、\"Thingamabob\"，诸如此类。",
	"None as such. Gearbox genuinely wishes to help the characters, but he will be tempted to connect with the monastery control room.": "没有这样的。齿轮箱真心希望能帮助这些人物，但他会受到诱惑，与寺院控制室联系。",
	"Gearbox can appear with Garret whenever the tiefling first appears, or he could be found in the monastery's control room.

	"The floating island is all that remains of the planar craft that crashed into the mountains eons ago. The force of its impact created this valley and nearly destroyed the craft.

	"Instead of asking a traditional riddle that the characters must solve, the enhanced sphinx demands that they ask a question that it cannot answer. This could be a riddle, a secret, a logical contradiction, or any other question—but the sphinx warns the characters that with all the knowledge it has collected throughout the years, it knows the answer to every question. If it fails to answer, the characters are allowed to cross to the island without paying the toll.": "狮身人面像没有提出人物必须解决的传统谜题，而是要求他们提出一个它无法回答的问题。这可能是一个谜语，一个秘密，一个逻辑矛盾，或任何其他问题--但狮身人面像警告角色们，凭借它多年来收集的所有知识，它知道每个问题的答案。如果它不回答，人物就可以不付通行费而穿越到岛上。",
	"With its enhanced knowledge, the sphinx can correctly answer almost any question. To simulate this around the table, you might challenge the players to stump you as the DM with a riddle or trivia question.

	"The flying ferry is summoned from the monastery's dock at the sphinx's mental command, crossing over to the cliff ledge. The ferry also comes if the sphinx is killed, adhering to the Grand Master's orders that any powerful visitors are to be brought to the devil's attention.

	"The ferry is operated by a {@creature Merrenoloth|MTF} (originally from {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}). It is crafted from laboratory debris attached to a small engine similar to the large engines holding the monastery aloft. The skiff can ferry up to ten Medium creatures at one time, and can be controlled automatically by the merrenoloth, Gearbox the modron, or a rescued brain in a jar (see area M8). A character can decipher the controls of a skiff with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check, allowing that character to control it. A skiff also requires at least one fully charged energy cell from the treasury (area M10) for fuel.": "这艘渡船是由一个{@creature Merrenoloth|MTF}(最初来自{@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF})操作的。它是由实验室的碎片制作而成，连接着一个类似于支撑修道院高空的大型引擎的小型引擎。这艘船一次最多可运送10个中型生物，并可由merrenoloth、Gearbox the modron或罐子里的获救大脑（见M8区）自动控制。一个角色可以通过成功的DC15智力检查来破译小艇的控制，从而使该角色能够控制它。一艘快艇还需要至少一个来自宝库（M10区）的充满电的能量电池作为燃料。",
	"The merrenoloth stays silent, but any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to glimpse beneath its hood sees a skeletal face. (The character can later note the resemblance between this visage and the monastery's flayed monks.)": "梅里诺洛特保持沉默，但任何通过DC14智慧({@skill Perception})检定成功的角色都能瞥见它头巾下的一张骷髅脸。(角色后来可以注意到这张脸与寺院的剥皮僧侣之间的相似性。）",
	"If any character is unfortunate enough to fall from the cliff, the other characters quickly lose sight of them in a light mist that covers the valley floor. Any subsequent search for a body comes up empty—because a floating teleportation-field device (see the sidebar) zooms around the bottom of the valley, and automatically teleports the falling character into the prison cells at area M6.": "如果有哪个角色不幸从悬崖上掉下来，其他角色很快就会在覆盖谷底的轻雾中失去踪影。随后对尸体的搜索都是空的--因为一个漂浮的传送场装置（见边栏）会在谷底放大，并自动将坠落的角色传送到M6区的牢房。",
	"The crashed planar craft still makes up most of the monastery's general structure, having been long ago converted into Kwalish's first laboratory, then converted again into this present sinister site. The overall sense of the place—as evidenced in the alien geometries of its buildings and its exposed technology—should be one of a brooding, otherworldly environ where nothing feels quite right.": "坠毁的平面飞行器仍然构成了寺院的大部分总体结构，很久以前被改造成Kwalish的第一个实验室，然后又被改造成现在这个阴森的地方。这个地方的整体感觉--从其建筑的异形几何形状和暴露的技术中可以看出--应该是一个忧郁的、另一个世界的环境，没有什么感觉是对的。",
	"Over long years, the monastery has drawn hundreds of dark recruits to its hidden location, through both whispered rumor and dark outreach to criminals seeking refuge from the law. Though the vast majority of those recruits have perished or been imprisoned at the hands of the Grand Master, twenty-five monks—all a motley assemblage of evil humanoids—currently occupy various areas of the monastery. All wear cowled robes to conceal their features, which can be seen only if a monk is forced to unmask, or if a watchful character gets close to a monk and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. Any monk whose face is seen shows an identical grim countenance—a face flayed nearly to the bone, the result of a brutal initiation to better match the appearance of the Grand Master.": "漫长的岁月里，通过低声的传言和对寻求法律庇护的罪犯的黑暗宣传，该寺院已经吸引了数百名黑暗的新兵来到它的隐蔽地点。虽然这些新兵中的绝大多数已经在大法师手中丧生或被囚禁，但25名僧侣--所有邪恶的人形生物的杂乱组合--目前占据着寺院的各个区域。所有的人都穿着有罩子的长袍来掩盖他们的特征，只有当一个僧侣被迫揭开面具，或者当一个警觉的人物接近一个僧侣并成功通过DC12智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查时，才能看到这些特征。任何被看到的僧侣的脸都显示出相同的狰狞面孔--一张几乎被剥去骨头的脸，这是为了更好地匹配大法师的外表而进行的残酷的启动仪式的结果。",
	"Wherever they are initially stationed, the monks all gather together if a general alarm is sounded, or to witness an audience in the central abbey (area M3). Each monk is a {@creature Cultist} that carries a smaller version of a bone devil's hooked polearm (see the sidebar in the \"Bone Devil\" section in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}), typically disguised as a staff or tool:": "无论他们最初驻扎在哪里，如果有总警报响起，僧侣们都会聚集在一起，或者在中央修道院（M3区）见证一个观众。每个僧侣都是一个{@creature Cultist}，携带一个较小版本的骨魔的钩状杆枪（见{@book Monster Manual|MM}中 \"骨魔 \"部分的侧边栏），通常伪装成法杖或工具。",
	"{@i Melee Weapon Attack}: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@i Hit}: 4 ({@dice 1d6 + 1}) piercing damage.

	"In addition, each group of five monks is led by an elder monk. These are {@creature Cult Fanatic||Cult Fanatics} that have outfitted their polearms with laser weapons secured from the monastery's stores of technology. These weapons are notoriously ineffective against polished metal armor and shields, which reflect their laser bolts:": "此外，每组五名僧侣由一名长老僧侣领导。这些人都是{@creature Cult Fanatic||Cult Fanatics}在他们的杆枪上装备了从寺院的技术仓库中获得的激光武器。这些武器对抛光的金属盔甲和盾牌是出了名的无效，因为它们会反射激光炮弹。",
	"{@i Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack}: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 40/100 ft., one creature. {@i Hit}: 7 ({@dice 1d10 + 2}) force damage.

	"One of the more impressive bits of technology from the crashed planar craft, teleportation-field devices consist of two matched magical-mechanical rings. Both rings channel the power of teleportation and flight, and were originally used to undertake repairs on the outside of the craft, handle dangerous substances at a distance, and so forth.": "从坠毁的平面飞船中获得的更令人印象深刻的技术之一，传送场装置由两个匹配的魔法机械环组成。这两个环都能引导传送和飞行的力量，最初是用来在飞船外部进行维修，在远处处理危险物质，诸如此类。",
	"When a creature passes an arm or other appendage into one ring, that appendage appears to emerge from the other ring, no matter how far apart the devices are. The second device has a flying speed of 40 feet, and can be flown remotely under the creature's control as part of its own movement. The remote device also grants the creature a sensory awareness of the area around it. This allows the appendage to be used normally, so that the creature can undertake any activity remotely that it could accomplish close up, including making physical ability checks and attacks.": "当一个生物将手臂或其他附属物传入一个环中时，该附属物就会从另一个环中出现，无论这些装置相距多远。第二个装置的飞行速度为40英尺，并且可以在生物的控制下远程飞行，作为其自身运动的一部分。远程装置也赋予生物对其周围区域的感官意识。这使得该附属装置可以正常使用，因此该生物可以在远程进行任何它可以近距离完成的活动，包括进行物理能力检查和攻击。",
	"Because they are linked to the planar craft, teleportation-field devices function only in the monastery and in Daoine Gloine (where Kwalish has used the magical-mechanical technology of the craft to set up his new lab). If the characters manage to secure a pair of such devices, you can let the players come up with novel ways to make use of them in those locations (assigning appropriate Intelligence checks if you want to make the process difficult). However, they can't be claimed as treasure.": "因为它们与平面飞船相连，所以传送场装置只在修道院和道恩-格洛因（Kwalish在那里利用飞船的魔法-机械技术建立了他的新实验室）发挥作用。如果角色们设法获得了一对这样的装置，你可以让玩家想出新奇的方法来在这些地方利用它们（如果你想让这个过程变得困难，可以指定适当的智力检查）。但是，它们不能作为宝物被认领。",
	"The Monastery of the Distressed Body has been secretly drawing in outlaws for decades. As such, you might add to the ranks of the monks with any number of villainous NPCs the players have heard about, or even foes that slipped through their clutches in years past. Sir Bluto Sans Pite from White Plume Mountain in {@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP} is a good candidate, as are Faroul and Gondolo from Port Nyanzaru in {@i Tomb of Annihilation}.": "几十年来，\"痛苦的身体 \"修道院一直在秘密地吸引着不法之徒。因此，你可以用玩家们听说过的任何数量的反派NPC，甚至是过去几年中从他们的魔掌中溜走的敌人来增加僧侣的队伍。来自{@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP}的白翎山的Bluto Sans Pite爵士是个不错的人选，来自{@i Tomb of Annihilation}的Nyanzaru港的Faroul和Gondolo也是。",
	"The monks do not interfere as the characters initially explore the monastery, and they keep their cowls down if they are approached. They say little about the workings of the place, but vaguely hint at how newcomers will be welcome to either join their \"immured brothers\" (the prisoners in area M6) or the \"enlightened ones\" (the brains in jars in the control room of area M8). They readily direct characters toward the Grand Master in the central abbey (area M3). If the monks are harassed, or if the characters spend too much time exploring on their own, Lean Meimbaol from area M1 arrives to personally escort them to the abbey.": "角色们最初探索修道院时，僧侣们并不干涉，如果有人接近他们，他们也会把头巾放下。他们对这个地方的运作几乎不闻不问，只是含糊地暗示新来者将被欢迎加入他们的 \"被监禁的兄弟\"（M6区的囚犯）或 \"开明的人\"（M8区控制室里装在瓶子里的大脑）。他们很容易将人物引向中央修道院（M3区）的大法师。如果僧侣们受到骚扰，或者角色们花了太多时间独自探索，M1区的Lean Meimbaol会亲自护送他们到修道院。",
	"If combat breaks out, the monks all reveal their true natures, and attempt to overwhelm and capture the characters.": "如果战斗爆发，僧侣们都会暴露出他们的真实本性，并试图压倒和俘虏这些角色。",
	"Some thirty humanoid prisoners ({@creature Commoner||Commoners}) are held in the monastery. All have had their faces flayed to make them barely distinguishable from the monks. Most work in the engine room (area M5) during the day, and are penned together at night in the cells of area M6. A smaller group of more dangerous humanoids has been permanently imprisoned in that same area.": "寺院里关押着大约三十名人形囚犯（{@creature Commoner||Commoners}）。所有的人都被剥去了脸皮，使他们几乎无法与僧侣们区分开来。大多数人白天在机房（M5区）工作，晚上则被关在M6区的牢房里。一小部分更危险的人形生物被永久地囚禁在同一区域。",
	"Several of the prisoners are survivors from previous expeditions sent into the Barrier Peaks by the Cartophile. They recognize any of the hirelings with the characters, or any other signs of the Cartophile's patronage (maps, notebooks, and so forth). Once contact has been made, they look to help the characters—especially if this also leads to their own escape. However, most of the other prisoners are former monks that tried to leave or otherwise got into trouble, and they look to curry favor with their captors by reporting subversive activity.": "有几个囚犯是以前被嗜车者派往壁垒峰的探险队的幸存者。他们能认出任何与人物在一起的雇佣者，或者任何其他有Cartophile赞助的迹象（地图、笔记本等等）。一旦取得联系，他们就会去帮助这些人物--特别是如果这也会导致他们自己的逃跑。然而，大多数其他囚犯都是试图离开或陷入麻烦的前僧侣，他们希望通过报告颠覆活动来讨好他们的俘虏。",
	"The following locations are identified on the map on page 9.": "第9页的地图上确定了以下地点。",
	"The merrenoloth's ferry departs from and arrives at this metallic dock. As the characters arrive, an elder monk named Lean Meimbaol greets them.": "Merrenoloth的渡船从这个金属码头出发并到达。当人物到达时，一位名叫Lean Meimbaol的长老和尚向他们问好。",
	"A figure dressed as a hooded monk stands beside the dock, awaiting your arrival. Though he does not lower his cowl, he greets you warmly.": "一个打扮成蒙面僧人的人物站在码头边上，等待着你的到来。虽然他没有放下他的头罩，但他热情地迎接你。",
	"\"Congratulations on your finding us! The Monastery of the Distressed Body remains ever open to new prospects. I am sure the Grand Master will find suitable use for your bodies... or your minds. May I take you to him now?\"": "\"祝贺你找到我们! 痛苦的身体寺院对新的前景永远是开放的。我相信大法师会为你们的身体......或你们的思想找到合适的用途。我现在可以带你们去见他吗？\"",
	"If the characters agree, they are brought to the central abbey (area M3). If they demure or refuse, Lean Meimbaol does not interfere with their exploration of the monastery. However, he does issue a subtle warning.": "如果人物同意，他们会被带到中央修道院（M3区）。如果他们畏缩或拒绝，Lean Meimbaol并不干涉他们对修道院的探索。然而，他确实发出了一个微妙的警告。",
	"\"It makes no difference, really. All who come here find their way to the Grand Master... eventually.\"": "\"这没有什么区别，真的。所有来到这里的人都会找到他们的路，最终找到大法师。\"",
	"At the surface level of the floating rock island, the monastery is laid out as a large campus composed of sharp-angled buildings. These jut out of the ground like massive metallic crystals, with scraggly gardens set between them and paths winding throughout. Five monks led by an elder can be found here, silently going about the business of gardening, observing prayers, scrubbing flagstones, and other mundane activities.": "在浮动石岛的表面，寺院被布置成一个由尖角建筑组成的大型校园。这些建筑像巨大的金属晶体一样突出地面，它们之间有杂乱无章的花园，小路蜿蜒而过。这里有五名僧侣，由一名长老带领，默默地进行着园艺、观察祈祷、擦洗旗杆石和其他世俗活动的工作。",
	"With a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) or Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check made to quietly search or inspect the area, a character learns a number of things regarding the monastery's darker nature. Graffiti scratched into the walls in thieves' cant and Infernal reveals dire sentiments regarding how the doubtful are punished, and how only service to the monastery can keep it aloft. In addition, the original metal of the structures here has been melted and reworked in many places into a preponderance of leering skulls.": "如果成功通过DC12智力({@skill Investigation})或智慧({@skill Perception})检查，悄悄地搜索或检查这个区域，角色就会了解到一些关于修道院的黑暗本质的事情。用盗贼的语气和无间道在墙上的涂鸦揭示了关于可疑者如何受到惩罚的可怕情绪，以及只有对修道院的服务才能使它保持高尚。此外，这里结构的原始金属已经被熔化，并在许多地方被重新加工成大量可耻的头骨。",
	"With a successful check result of 16 or higher, characters note that strange wiring runs throughout the grounds, seeming to connect all the buildings together, and originating in area M8 (the control room).": "如果检查结果为16或更高，人物会注意到奇怪的电线贯穿整个场地，似乎把所有的建筑都连接在一起，并且从M8区域（控制室）开始。",
	"If the check result is 14 or higher, a character catches sight or warning of magically animated leather faces (from area M7, the leather works) lurking around the most shadowy corners of the grounds. These unnatural creatures flutter away if any characters approach them, but they attack if pressed. Treat any group of leather faces as a {@creature Swarm of Bats}, and see the leather works (area M7) for more information.": "如果检查结果为14或更高，一个角色会看到或警告潜伏在场地最阴暗的角落里的、具有魔力的皮革脸（来自M7区，皮革厂）。如果有人物接近它们，这些非自然的生物就会飞走，但如果被逼迫，它们就会攻击。把任何一组皮革面孔看作是{@creature Swarm of Bats}，更多信息请看皮革工厂（M7区）。",
	"Visible from across the monastery grounds, the planar craft's former main conning tower rises several hundred feet into the air. It now serves as the monastery's central abbey.": "从整个修道院的院子里可以看到，这个平面飞行器以前的主炮塔耸立在几百英尺的空中。它现在是寺院的中央修道院。",
	"A massive pair of cathedral doors open onto a long nave. Rows of balconies line the walls, occupied by a couple of dozen hooded monks seemingly come to watch the audience about to take place.": "一对巨大的大教堂门通向一个长长的中殿。一排排的阳台排列在墙上，被几十个戴着头巾的僧侣占据着，他们似乎是来观看即将发生的听证会的。",
	"At the far end of the nave, a throne resembling a twisted metal captain's chair rises from a metallic dais backed by an ornate arch. There sits the Grand Master of the Distressed Body—a bone devil flanked by two massive bodyguards. The Grand Master wears a patchwork leather robe and a gleaming crown, and it carries a scepter set with odd crystal bumps and metal flanges. With its other hand, the devil taps the arm of the throne, showing off nails set with gleaming metallic shards.": "在大殿的远端，一个类似于扭曲的金属船长椅的宝座从一个金属台子上升起，台子后面是一个华丽的拱门。那里坐着的是 \"痛苦的身体 \"的大法师--一个骨质的魔鬼，两边是两个巨大的保镖。大法师穿着一件拼接的皮袍，戴着一顶闪闪发光的皇冠，拿着一根镶嵌着奇怪的水晶凸点和金属凸缘的权杖。魔鬼用另一只手拍打着王座的手臂，露出镶嵌着闪亮金属碎片的指甲。",
	"\"Welcome,\" the Grand Master says. \"We get few supplicants here of your obvious experience and skill. You shall do well in service here at the monastery. But will that service be with the strength of your bodies or the strength of your minds?\"": "\"欢迎，\"大法师说。\"我们这里很少有像你这样有明显经验和技能的祈求者。你们将在寺院的服务中表现出色。但这种服务是用你们身体的力量还是用你们思想的力量？\"",
	"As the characters draw closer to the Grand Master, anyone can see that the devil's horrid leather cloak is crafted from the faces of flayed monks and prisoners, the flesh cured to leather and roughly stitched together. The scepter and crown it bears appear almost mechanical in nature, and are crafted from repurposed magical-mechanical parts from the planar craft. Large rings seemingly crafted in the same way encircle the devil's arms and tail.": "随着人物越来越接近大法师，任何人都可以看到，魔鬼可怕的皮斗篷是由剥落的僧侣和囚犯的脸制成的，肉体被固化为皮革，粗略地缝合在一起。它所带的权杖和王冠看起来几乎是机械性的，是由平面工艺中的魔法机械部件重新制作而成的。大环似乎是以同样的方式制作的，环绕着恶魔的手臂和尾巴。",
	"If a monk escorted the characters here, the Grand Master makes an example of that servitor for allowing weapons to be brought into its holy presence. Otherwise, the Grand Master is making an example of a random monk when the characters enter this area. In either event, the devil's elder monk bodyguards (see below) are ordered to strike with their exotic weapons, executing the errant monk while the Grand Master welcomes the characters.": "如果有僧侣护送人物到此，大法师就会以该仆人为榜样，因为他允许武器被带入其圣地。否则，当人物进入这个区域时，大法师就会对一个随机的僧侣做出榜样。无论是哪种情况，魔鬼的长老僧侣保镖（见下文）都会被命令用他们的异域武器出击，在大法师欢迎这些人物的同时处决那个犯错的僧侣。",
	"The bone devil is an arrogant bully, and assumes that the characters have come to join its cult. However, it also comes across as whiny and petulant, reliant on the protection of its bodyguards rather than making any physical threats. If asked about Kwalish, the Grand Master gladly recounts how it took over the floating island and drove Kwalish to a second location—some lost city farther into the Barrier Peaks.": "骨魔是个傲慢的恶棍，它认为这些人物是来加入它的邪教的。然而，它也表现得爱发牢骚、爱撒娇，依赖其保镖的保护，而不是进行任何人身威胁。如果被问及Kwalish，大法师会很高兴地讲述它是如何占领浮岛并将Kwalish赶到第二个地方--某个更远的壁垒峰的失落城市。",
	"The devil has seen Kwalish's notes (found in the treasury, area M10), which confirm that the inventor was intent on seeking the legendary city of Daoine Gloine. It offers to let the characters see them as well—in exchange for the \"modest fee\" of all the characters' magic items, and one year of service from either the strongest or most intelligent character. (The devil is always in need of fresh servants to shovel fuel in the engine room, and fresh minds to replace the brains in the control room.) If the characters reject this offer, the Grand Master demands a year of service simply for the honor of the characters having visited the monastery, after which they are free to leave.": "恶魔看到了Kwalish的笔记（在库房中找到，M10区），证实了发明家有意寻找传说中的城市Daoine Gloine。它提出让角色们也看看这些笔记--以所有角色的魔法物品的 \"适度费用\"，以及最强壮或最聪明的角色一年的服务作为交换。(魔鬼总是需要新的仆人在机房里铲油，需要新的头脑来取代控制室里的大脑）。如果角色拒绝这个提议，大法师会要求他们服务一年，这仅仅是为了角色访问修道院的荣誉，之后他们就可以自由离开。",
	"Any characters foolish enough to volunteer their service are taken to the leather works (area M7) to have their faces flayed. As soon as those characters are out of the abbey, the Grand Master orders the other adventurers to be murdered and looted. If it is attacked or its orders are openly defied, the bone devil orders the characters attacked at once. The Grand Master fights only if directly threatened, or if its bodyguards and monks appear to be losing the fight.": "任何愚蠢到自愿服务的角色都会被带到皮革厂（M7区）剥去脸皮。一旦这些角色离开了修道院，大法师就会命令其他冒险者被谋杀和掠夺。如果它受到攻击或它的命令被公然违抗，骨魔就会命令这些角色立即受到攻击。大法师只有在受到直接威胁时才会战斗，或者它的保镖和僧侣似乎在战斗中失败。",
	"Shards of a {@item Vorpal Sword} once broken against the devil replace its claws. A successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) or Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check identifies them as such. When the devil rolls a 20 on an attack roll with a claw, the target is decapitated. (At your option, the attack can instead deal an extra {@dice 6d8} slashing damage.) A target is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, has legendary actions, doesn't have or need a head, or if you decide that the target is too large for its head to be cut off by the devil's claws. If removed, the shards lose their magical powers.": "曾经对着魔鬼打碎的{@item Vorpal Sword}的碎片取代了它的爪子。成功通过DC12智力({@skill Arcana})或智慧({@skill Perception})检查可识别它们的身份。当魔鬼在用爪子攻击时掷出20分，目标会被斩首。(根据你的选择，攻击可以造成额外的{@dice 6d8}砍击伤害。) 如果目标对砍杀伤害免疫，有传奇行动，没有或不需要头，或者你决定目标太大，它的头会被恶魔的爪子砍掉，那么它就对这个效果免疫。如果被移除，碎片会失去它们的魔力。",
	"Local teleportation-field bracelets encircle the devil's arms and tail. These devices allow the Grand Master to make its claw and sting attacks remotely, though still on the devil's turn and using its actions.": "局部传送场手镯环绕着魔鬼的手臂和尾巴。这些装置允许大法师远程进行爪击和刺击攻击，尽管仍然是在魔鬼的回合中，并使用它的行动。",
	"Two half-orc monks named East Wind and West Wind protect the Grand Master at all times. Each is a {@creature Martial Arts Adept|VGM} with these changes:": "两个名为东风和西风的半兽人僧侣一直在保护大法师。每个人都是{@creature Martial Arts Adept|VGM}，有这些变化。",
	"{@i Melee Weapon Attack}: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@i Hit}: 7 ({@dice 1d8 + 3}) piercing damage. If East Wind rolls a 20 on the attack roll, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the effects of a {@i polymorph} spell.": "{@i Melee Weapon Attack}: 命中率+5，范围5英尺，一个目标。{@i Hit}: 7 ({@dice 1d8 + 3})穿刺伤害。如果东风在攻击卷上掷出20分，目标必须在DC15智慧救赎中成功，否则会受到{@i polymorph}法术的影响。",
	"{@i Melee Weapon Attack}: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@i Hit}: 7 ({@dice 1d8 + 3}) piercing damage. If West Wind rolls a 20 on the attack roll, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effects of a {@i flesh to stone} spell.": "{@i Melee Weapon Attack}: 命中率+5，范围5英尺，一个目标。{@i Hit}: 7 ({@dice 1d8 + 3})穿刺伤害。如果西风在攻击卷上掷出20分，目标必须在DC15宪法救赎中成功，否则会受到{@i flesh to stone}法术的影响。",
	"The Grand Master makes for a difficult fight on its own, and the addition of bodyguards and monks targeting characters from the balconies could quickly overwhelm a party. You might opt to have the Grand Master reveal some of the workings of the monastery through its boasting—specifically, the existence of the treasury and the brains in jars guarding its access. Doing so might encourage characters to escape in that direction during the commotion of a fight.": "大法师本身就很难打，如果再加上保镖和僧侣从阳台上瞄准人物，很快就会把一个队伍压垮。你可以选择让大法师通过吹嘘来揭示寺院的一些运作情况--特别是库房的存在和守卫库房通道的罐子里的大脑。这样做可能会鼓励人物在战斗的骚动中向那个方向逃跑。",
	"If the characters are overwhelmed, the Grand Master looks to have them captured rather than killed, as the devil is ever in need of fresh servants. Captured characters are taken to the cells in area M6, where you can create escape scenarios for them of your own devising.": "如果人物被压倒，大法师希望他们被俘，而不是被杀，因为魔鬼永远需要新的仆人。被俘的人物会被带到M6区的牢房，在那里你可以为他们创造自己设计的逃跑方案。",
	"The throne is an assemblage of magical-mechanical parts backed by a standing metallic arch set with complex filigree. The armrests of the throne are set with a complicated array of instruments, though many of the controls have been stripped away. (The throne was once the control center of the archway—the gate Kwalish opened to the Nine Hells, crafted from the technology of the crashed planar craft.)": "宝座是一个由魔法机械部件组成的组合，背后是一个立着的金属拱门，上面镶嵌着复杂的花纹。宝座的扶手上设置了一系列复杂的仪器，尽管许多控制装置已经被剥离了。(王座曾经是拱门的控制中心--奎利什打开的通往九层地狱的大门，由坠毁的星球飞船的技术制作而成）。",
	"A character who sits on the throne notes that many of its instruments are still operational, allowing them to track the comings and goings of the merrenoloth's ferry. If a creature seated in the throne wears the bone devil's crown and holds its scepter, that creature can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check to reopen the archway. Treat a successful check as if the character had cast the {@spell gate} spell to open a gate to the Nine Hells.": "坐在宝座上的人物注意到，宝座上的许多仪器仍在运作，使他们能够追踪梅里诺洛斯渡船的来去。如果坐在宝座上的生物戴着骨魔的冠冕，拿着它的权杖，该生物可以尝试用DC15智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查来重新打开拱门。如果检查成功，就像该角色施展了{@spell gate}的法术来打开通往九幽地狱的大门一样。",
	"The crown and scepter are crafted of rare metal alloys and set with jeweled crystalline buttons plundered from the planar craft's instrument panels. They have no magical power outside the monastery and the city of Daoine Gloine (see area O4), but if sold as art objects, the crown is worth 500 gp and the scepter is worth 750 gp.": "王冠和权杖由稀有的金属合金制成，并镶有从平面飞船的仪表板上掠夺来的宝石晶石按钮。它们在修道院和道恩-格洛因城（见O4区）之外没有魔法力量，但如果作为艺术品出售，王冠价值500金币，权杖价值750金币。",
	"When not on duty, the monks reside in this series of ill-kept rooms.": "在不值班的时候，僧侣们就住在这一系列保管不善的房间里。",
	"Each of these dormitory cells contains only a bed, a trunk for personal effects, and a table. All are crafted of scrap parts from the complex mechanical detritus of the monastery, and feature residual buttons, dials, and meters that have no discernible purpose. The walls here are covered in graffiti, suggesting a steady series of new residents over long years.": "每间宿舍只包含一张床、一个放个人物品的箱子和一张桌子。所有这些都是用修道院复杂的机械残骸中的废旧零件制作的，并有一些没有明显用途的残留按钮、表盘和仪表。这里的墙壁上布满了涂鸦，表明在漫长的岁月里有一系列稳定的新居民。",
	"A group of five monks led by an elder monk can be found here at any time, sleeping, eating, and taking part in decidedly non-monastic activities (gambling, flinging chamber pots at one another, comparing dueling scars, plotting a way to rob the treasury, and so forth).": "在这里可以随时找到由一位长老带领的五名僧人，他们睡觉、吃饭，并参加明显的非寺院活动（赌博、互相扔锅子、比较决斗的疤痕、策划抢劫国库的方法，等等）。",
	"This area contains the magical workings of the monastery's engines.": "这个区域包含了寺院发动机的神奇工作原理。",
	"The fuel originally carried by the planar craft has long been exhausted, and prisoners now shovel low-grade ore mined from the surrounding mountains into the furnaces beneath this area. The powerful fires of those furnaces keep the monastery in the air, and instantly destroy anything thrown into their open vents.": "最初由平面飞行器运载的燃料早已耗尽，现在囚犯们将从周围的山中开采的低级矿石铲入这片区域下面的熔炉。这些熔炉的强大火力使寺院保持在空中，并立即摧毁任何被扔进其开放的通风口的东西。",
	"If ore ceases to be fed to the furnaces (most likely due to the characters freeing the prisoners here and breaking the Grand Master's power) the engines begin to fail over a 24-hour period. When the furnaces stop burning after that point, the monastery plunges into the valley to be destroyed, along with any creatures still inside it.": "如果矿石不再被送入熔炉（很可能是由于角色释放了这里的囚犯并打破了大法师的权力），引擎就会在24小时内开始失效。当熔炉在那之后停止燃烧时，寺院就会坠入山谷，连同里面的任何生物一起被摧毁。",
	"Five monks led by an elder oversee a group of twenty prisoners toiling to keep the engines burning and the monastery aloft. If the monks are dealt with and the prisoners are freed, they can fill the characters in on the layout of the monastery. All the prisoners are desperate to escape the monastery before its engines fail. They can steal a skiff and follow the marked trails out of the Barrier Peaks if left to their own devices.": "五个和尚在一个长老的带领下，监督着20个囚犯，让他们努力维持发动机的燃烧和寺院的运转。如果这些僧侣被解决了，囚犯被释放了，他们就可以向人物介绍寺院的布局。所有的囚犯都急切地想趁着修道院的引擎失灵之前逃出修道院。如果让他们自己决定，他们可以偷一艘小船，沿着有标记的小路离开屏障峰。",
	"This area is lined with boxlike metal cells, all built of the same strange materials seen elsewhere in the monastery. Most of the cells are empty, but shouts and a sound of creatures hammering on locked doors are heard from a few.": "这个区域有很多箱形金属牢房，都是用修道院其他地方的奇怪材料建造的。大多数牢房都是空的，但有几间牢房里传出喊叫声和生物敲打上锁门的声音。",
	"Any prisoners not working in the engine room or mining the ore fed to the engines (see \"{@area Cavern Encounters|0b9|x}\" in {@adventure appendix A|LLK|4}) are kept here, as are any prisoners that are sick or injured but still able to move under their own power. As well, a group of prisoners deemed too dangerous to work but too valuable to kill have been designated \"immured ones\" and incarcerated here, where the monks attempt to break their wills and return them to servitude.": "任何不在机房工作或开采供给发动机的矿石的囚犯（见{@adventure appendix A|LLK|4}中的\"{@area Cavern Encounters|0b9|x}\"）都被关在这里，任何生病或受伤但仍能靠自己的力量行动的囚犯也是如此。此外，一群被认为太危险而不能工作，但又太有价值而不能杀死的囚犯被指定为 \"被囚禁者\"，并被关押在这里，僧侣们试图打破他们的意志，让他们回到奴役状态。",
	"The cells are all repurposed metal containers from the planar craft, and are all locked. A character can pick a cell's lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The metal of the cells is especially susceptible to the planar craft's technology, allowing a lock to be automatically sliced open with an attack from an elder monk's force pike.": "这些牢房都是由平面工艺改造的金属容器，并且都上了锁。一个角色可以使用盗贼的工具，通过成功的DC15灵巧检查来撬开一个牢房的锁。牢房的金属特别容易受到平面工艺技术的影响，允许用长老僧侣的力矛攻击自动切开锁。",
	"Characters who fall to the valley floor (area C4) from area C1 or area M9 are picked up by a floating teleportation-field device (see the sidebar) and teleported into one of these locked cells.": "从C1区或M9区掉到谷底（C4区）的角色会被一个漂浮的传送场装置（见侧边栏）接走，并被传送到这些锁定的牢房中。",

	"The planar craft's medical station has been repurposed into a torture chamber by the Grand Master. Here, new arrivals are flayed to take on the bone devil's own ghastly image.": "平面飞行器的医疗站被大法师改造成了一个刑讯室。在这里，新来的人被剥皮，呈现出骨魔本身的可怕形象。",
	"This chamber resembles some horrid combination of a tanner's, an alchemist's, and a butcher's. Knives and other implements lie scattered about, razor sharp and streaked with blood and gore. Bottles and canisters of preserving chemicals are heaped up on tables and shelves, many of them leaking or spilled. Barrels identifiable by their sharp smell as powerful tanning acids stand open against the walls, beneath rows of hanging chains.": "这个房间类似于某种可怕的皮匠、炼金术士和屠夫的组合。刀子和其他工具散落一地，锋利无比，上面布满了血迹和血浆。桌子和架子上堆满了保存化学品的瓶子和罐子，其中许多都漏了或洒了。在一排排悬挂着的铁链下，可以从其尖锐的气味中辨别出是强力的鞣酸，靠墙而立。",
	"A limp, leather-clad figure is curled against the wall beneath the chains. Another figure lies strapped to a table, showing no sign of injury but surrounded by a group of monks that appear to be preparing for some horrid ceremony. Hanging on the walls around the table are a number of grotesque leather masks.": "一个软弱无力、身穿皮衣的人蜷缩在铁链下的墙上。另一个人躺在一张桌子上，没有受伤的迹象，但周围有一群僧侣，似乎正在准备举行某种可怕的仪式。桌子周围的墙壁上挂着一些怪异的皮革面具。",
	"The leather masks that hang around the room are the flayed faces of monks and prisoners, recognizable as such with a successful DC 13 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check or by any character who has seen the horrid leather robe worn by the Grand Master.": "悬挂在房间里的皮面具是僧侣和囚犯的剥皮脸，只要成功通过DC13智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查，或者任何见过大法师所穿的恐怖皮袍的角色都能认出这一点。",
	"Any inspection or a successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check reveals that the leather-clad figure on the floor is actually a suit of {@item Leather Golem Armor|LLK}. See {@adventure appendix D|LLK|7} for more information.": "任何检查或成功的DC12智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查都会发现，地板上的皮衣形象实际上是一套{@item Leather Golem Armor|LLK}的衣服。更多信息见{@adventure appendix D|LLK|7}。",
	"If any leather mask is placed on the face of a flayed prisoner while that prisoner is targeted by healing magic, the magic of the mask is undone and the prisoner's original face is restored.": "如果在被剥皮的囚犯被治疗魔法锁定时，将任何皮革面具放在该囚犯的脸上，那么面具的魔法就会被解除，囚犯的原貌就会恢复。",
	"This central area once served as the bridge of the planar craft.": "这个中心区域曾经是平面飞船的桥梁。",
	"This area is a maze of damaged controls and broken machinery. Countless wires twist their way across the walls, erupting from control panels that have been pulled apart to lay bare their internal components. Five clear canisters connected by metal tubing and wires line the walls, each one filled with viscous fluid—and what appears to be a humanoid brain.": "这个区域是一个由损坏的控制装置和破碎的机器组成的迷宫。无数的电线在墙壁上缠绕，从被拉开的控制面板上喷涌而出，使其内部组件暴露无遗。墙上有五个由金属管和电线连接的透明罐子，每个罐子里都装着粘稠的液体--似乎是一个人形大脑。",
	"Any wires spotted by the characters in area M2 all eventually end up here. An inspection of the room and its control panels show that most of the magical-mechanical components once here have been stripped out. These were worked into Kwalish's original experiments or otherwise repurposed.": "M2区的人物所发现的任何电线最终都在这里。对这个房间及其控制面板的检查显示，曾经在这里的大部分魔法机械部件都被剥离了。这些都是在夸里什原来的实验中使用的，或者以其他方式重新利用。",
	"Each brain speaks Common and another language of your choice, and is able to communicate from within its canister. Some identify themselves as members of Kwalish's original expedition, while others are wizards and other spellcasters enslaved by the monks.": "每个大脑都会说普通话和你选择的另一种语言，并且能够从它的罐子里进行交流。有些人认为自己是夸里什最初的探险队成员，而其他人则是被僧侣们奴役的巫师和其他施法者。",
	"With respectful discussion and a successful DC 12 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, a brain can be enticed to reveal its knowledge of Kwalish and his initial expedition. All of Kwalish's companions died at the hands of the sphinx, but the inventor managed to harvest their brains in order to return them to a semblance of life. Kwalish promised to research a means of finding new bodies for his fallen companions, but was driven away by the Grand Master before he could complete this task. The brains suspect that Kwalish traveled onward to Daoine Gloine, and though they don't know the route, they do know that Kwalish's journal from their original expedition can be found in the treasury (area M10).": "通过尊重的讨论和成功的DC12魅力({@skill Persuasion})检查，一个大脑可以被引诱来透露它对Kwalish和他最初探险的知识。奎利什的所有同伴都死于狮身人面像之手，但这位发明家设法收获了他们的大脑，以使他们恢复了生命的模样。夸里什承诺为他死去的同伴们研究出一种寻找新身体的方法，但在他完成这项任务之前就被大法师赶走了。大脑们怀疑夸里什继续前往道恩-格洛因，虽然他们不知道路线，但他们知道夸里什最初探险的日记可以在宝库（M10区）找到。",

But you can easily reverse that setup by having the Cartophile's lore lead the characters straight to Daoine Gloine—with the lost city set up as the site of Kwalish's first lab. Kwalish isn't there, but old lore and notes talk of how he was driven from the area by the ooze, and allow the characters to reach the monastery. There, Kwalish can be found as the final brain in a jar in the treasury (area M10). Alternatively, the Cartophile's material might lead the characters to the monastery, but also reveal caverns that continue past and provide a route straight to Daoine Gloine. Taking that route to find Kwalish in the city, the characters are asked by the inventor to help purge the monastery of the Grand Master and finally reunite the brains in jars with new bodies.": "当人物进入屏障之峰时，冒险中的Cartophile的笔记和地图最初将他们引向曾经是Kwalish的第一个实验室的修道院。修道院的宝库中还藏有更多的笔记和传说，让人物继续向道恩-格洛因推进。但是你可以很容易地颠覆这种设定，让嗜卡者的传说直接将人物引向Daoine Gloine--将这座失落的城市设定为Kwalish的第一个实验室的所在地。奎利什不在那里，但古老的传说和笔记中提到了他是如何被渗出物赶出该地区的，并允许人物到达修道院。在那里，Kwalish可以在库房（M10区）的一个罐子里找到最后的大脑。另外，嗜卡者的材料可能会把人物带到修道院，但也会发现继续过去的洞穴，并提供一条直接通往Daoine Gloine的路线。沿着这条路线找到城市中的Kwalish，人物被发明家要求帮助清除修道院中的大法师，并最终使罐子中的大脑与新的身体重新结合。",
	"When Kwalish found it, the legendary lost city of Daoine Gloine was already an isolated mountain settlement. After he took over, the inventor set about closing off any and all routes to the site. As such, as the characters follow the notes found in Kwalish's journal, they find that the narrow mountain passes begin to tighten around them the closer they come to the location where the city is said to be. Many of the passes, tunnels, and trails the characters follow are deliberately blocked off with rockslides and other unexplained disasters. The need to circumnavigate such areas accounts for much of the travel time to the city, unless the characters have arranged an alternative method of travel.": "当Kwalish发现它的时候，传说中的失落之城Daoine Gloine已经是一个与世隔绝的山区定居点。在他接手后，这位发明家着手关闭了通往该地的所有路线。因此，当人物按照Kwalish日记中的说明行事时，他们发现，越是接近传说中的城市所在地，周围狭窄的山路就越是紧张。人物所走过的许多通道、隧道和小路都被故意用岩石滑坡和其他无法解释的灾难封锁了。绕过这些区域的需要占去了前往城市的大部分时间，除非人物安排了其他的旅行方式。",

	"The city of Daoine Gloine has long been thought of as mere legend—just another strange tale from the already-strange Barrier Peaks. Occasionally, travelers would return from the mountains with wild claims of having been lost in the peaks and visiting the city by accident. And though none of them could produce a full map showing the route they took, their stories all shared a common element—that Daoine Gloine was populated by creatures made of living glass, tended to by kenku in love with those creatures' shining beauty. These occasional tales drove more explorers—including Kwalish's own expedition—to seek out the route to Daoine Gloine and learn the truth of who dwelled there.": "Daoine Gloine城长期以来一直被认为只是一个传说--只是来自已经很奇怪的屏障山峰的另一个奇怪的故事。偶尔会有旅行者从山上回来，疯狂地宣称自己在山峰中迷路，意外地来到了这座城市。尽管他们中没有人能够拿出一张完整的地图来显示他们所走的路线，但他们的故事都有一个共同点--道恩-格洛因的居民都是由活的玻璃制成的生物，由热爱这些生物的闪亮之美的肯库来照顾。这些偶发的故事促使更多的探险家--包括Kwalish自己的探险队--去寻找通往Daoine Gloine的路线，了解谁居住在那里的真相。",
	"After Kwalish fled his first laboratory, he used the initial research of his expedition to eventually make his way to Daoine Gloine. But instead of being welcomed and allowed to work in peace, Kwalish found the city's evil high priest threatening to transform him into Daoine Gloine's latest art installation. Desperate, Kwalish constructed another planar gateway while imprisoned in the temple, then opened a portal to the 222nd layer of the Abyss—Juiblex's Slime Pits. A flood of ooze issued forth, driving the kenku from Daoine Gloine and effectively sealing the city away from the rest of the world.": "在Kwalish逃离他的第一个实验室后，他利用最初的考察研究，最终来到Daoine Gloine。但是，Kwalish并没有受到欢迎并被允许和平地工作，而是发现这个城市邪恶的大祭司威胁要把他变成Daoine Gloine的最新艺术装置。绝望的Kwalish在被囚禁在神庙中时建造了另一个平面网关，然后打开了一个通往深渊第222层的门户--Juiblex的粘液坑。渗出物的洪流喷涌而出，将肯库赶出了道恩-格洛因，并有效地将该城市与世界其他地方隔离开来。",
	"The entire site—including the entrance to Kwalish's second lab—now spreads beneath a deadly layer of clear gelatinous ooze—perfectly preserved, eerily staged, and utterly devoid of anything organic. The kenku that once occupied Daoine Gloine have all long been turned to glass or driven out. The city's only resident is Kwalish, but the inventor has developed potent defenses to defend the entrance to his lab.": "整个场地--包括Kwalish的第二个实验室的入口--现在散布在一层致命的透明胶状渗出物之下--完美地保存着，阴森地上演着，完全没有任何有机物。曾经占据Daoine Gloine的Kenku早就变成了玻璃，或者被赶走了。这个城市唯一的居民是Kwalish，但这位发明家已经开发了强大的防御系统来保卫他的实验室的入口。",

	"On the ground floor of the temple tower, beneath the ooze where it fills the lower levels of the building, is a standing arch that is a match to the arch in the central abbey of the monastery ({@area area M3|04e|x}), but without the throne. If the crown and scepter from that area are worn and held by a creature within 5 feet of the arch (including a creature within an {@item Apparatus of Kwalish} or similar device), that creature can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check to open the archway. Treat this as if the character had cast the {@spell gate} spell to open a gate to the 222nd layer of the Abyss.": "在寺庙塔楼的底层，在充斥着建筑下层的渗水下面，有一个立着的拱门，与寺院中央修道院（{@area area M3|04e|x}）的拱门相匹配，但没有王座。如果该区域的王冠和权杖被拱门周围5英尺内的生物（包括{@item Apparatus of Kwalish}或类似装置内的生物）佩戴并持有，该生物可以尝试用DC15智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查来打开拱门。这就像人物施展{@spell gate}法术来打开通往深渊第222层的大门一样。",

	"A {@creature Clockwork Kraken|LLK} has been installed in this area by Kwalish to protect the city. The main component of the construct's clockwork engine is a coffin-like structure that bears a strong resemblance to Ctenmiir's coffin. The engine housing can be opened with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check or Dexterity check made with thieves' tools or tinker's tools.

	"The scattered notes and diagrams in this area can be used to repair and operate the {@item Apparatus of Kwalish}, but must first be deciphered with a successful DC 13 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. They also describe Kwalish's desire to construct a final laboratory hidden within an extradimensional space, and how he experimented with the city's materials to construct such spaces within baubles of glass and crystal.

	"The suit of armor at the end of the room is clearly the focus of the lab's current experimentation, connected to various pieces of equipment by more silver wire recognizable as a form of astral cord.

Though surprised by visitors, Kwalish listens to the characters and might even be willing to bargain for whatever help they need to complete their quest.

If unsuccessful, he demands one bit of soul from each character in exchange for his aid or information. The magically enhanced demilich skull built into the lab's instrumentation panels is used to channel a character's soul energy once the bargain is struck. A character who has a portion of their soul removed in this way falls under a curse. While so cursed, whenever the character drops to 0 hit points, they are treated as if they had already failed one death saving throw. This curse can be removed only by a {@spell remove curse} spell cast by an 18th-level spellcaster, by defeating Kwalish and reversing the process using his machines, or by completing a separate task for the inventor.": "在成功通过DC15魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查与Kwalish谈判时，地精只要求任何一个角色提供一点灵魂能量。如果不成功，他就要求每个角色提供一点灵魂能量以换取他的帮助或信息。一旦达成交易，实验室的仪器面板上内置的魔力增强的Demilich头骨会被用来引导角色的灵魂能量。一个以这种方式被移除部分灵魂的角色会受到诅咒。在被诅咒期间，只要角色的命中率下降到0，他们就会被视为已经失败了一次死亡拯救。这个诅咒只能通过18级施法者施展的{@spell remove curse}法术来解除，或者通过击败Kwalish并使用他的机器逆转这个过程，或者通过为发明家完成一个单独的任务。",
	"Once he is freed, Kwalish is as grateful as he is able to express, and willing to listen to the characters' requests. This has the same outcome as above, but assume that negotiations are automatically successful and only one character needs to offer up a piece of their soul.": "一旦他被释放，Kwalish就会像他所能表达的那样感激，并愿意倾听人物的请求。这与上面的结果相同，但假设谈判自动成功，只有一个角色需要献出他们的一块灵魂。",
	"Kwalish is missing, his physical body having been caught up within his laboratory equipment and rendered into various bodily components that now make their way through the glass piping in perpetuity. His mind, however, can still communicate through various means—clockwork ants forming signals and signs, messages drawn by mechanical hands, consultation with the trapped mind flayer, and so on. As best he can, Kwalish tries to instruct characters in the methods that might reconstitute his body (with those methods determined by you). Unfortunately, some of his body parts have been installed elsewhere in the city (within other baubles, forming part of the kraken's engine, and so forth) and must be tracked down.": "夸里什失踪了，他的肉体被卷入他的实验室设备中，并被转化为各种身体部件，这些部件现在通过玻璃管道永久地进行着。然而，他的思想仍然可以通过各种方式进行交流--发条蚂蚁形成的信号和标志、机械手画出的信息、与被困的读心者的协商，等等。夸里什尽其所能，试图用可能重建他身体的方法来指导角色（这些方法由你决定）。不幸的是，他的一些身体部位已经被安装在城市的其他地方（在其他宝物中，形成克拉肯的引擎的一部分，等等），必须被追踪到。",
	"If the characters are successful, the regenerated Kwalish is grateful enough to help them with their quest even without payment. He then offers an additional boon to any interested character, granting the use of his laboratory to craft or summon any item or creature they desire (within any limits you set).

	"However he is met, Kwalish presents himself as a detached, single-minded researcher. In his mind, his work is more important than any other concerns, and he believes that the secrets of the technology found in the Barrier Peaks hold a vast potential to advance knowledge. If questioned, he proudly details his experiments (including with the {@i powered armor}), as well as the complete history of his time in the Barrier Peaks. If pressed, he talks of how he salvaged the minds of the members of his first expedition only after they were slain by the sphinx, and of how he buried Daoine Gloine in ooze only after discovering its inhabitants to be depraved cultists. In both cases, the inventor deemed his desperate actions as necessary measures to advance his research.": "无论人们如何认识他，夸里什都把自己表现为一个超然的、一心一意的研究者。在他看来，他的工作比其他任何问题都要重要，他相信在壁垒峰发现的技术秘密拥有推动知识发展的巨大潜力。如果被问及，他自豪地详述了他的实验（包括与{@i powered armor}的实验），以及他在壁垒峰的完整历史。如果被追问，他就会说到他是如何在第一次探险的成员被狮身人面像杀死后才抢救出他们的思想，以及他是如何在发现Daoine Gloine的居民是堕落的邪教徒后才将其埋入渗水中。在这两种情况下，发明家认为他的绝望行为是推进其研究的必要措施。",
	"Depending on your specific adventure hook and how this adventure fits into your overall campaign, completing the adventure might have multiple ramifications.": "根据你具体的冒险钩子和这个冒险如何适合你的整个活动，完成冒险可能有多种后果。",
	"If Kwalish's knowledge was needed to oppose threats in other lands, those threats might have been permanently quelled—or they might only have been temporarily driven back. Moreover, Kwalish's aid could inadvertently create new threats, as might happen if opening the coffin-prison of the vampire, Ctenmiir, opens similar Kwalish-designed prisons across the world.": "如果需要Kwalish的知识来反对其他土地上的威胁，这些威胁可能已经被永久平息了，或者它们可能只是被暂时赶了回去。此外，Kwalish的援助可能无意中创造了新的威胁，如果打开吸血鬼Ctenmiir的棺材监狱，在世界各地打开类似Kwalish设计的监狱，就可能发生这种情况。",
	"The power in the Barrier Peaks likely shifts dramatically if the Grand Master is defeated, and a new power struggle soon ensues for control of the monastery. If Ctenmiir escapes or is freed, he might return to the monastery to occupy it as his new lair. {@creature Mary Greymalkin|LLK} joins him there, creating a sanctum of evil magic. If Gearbox has connected with the monastery, he might remain there as the pair's unwitting servant—or the modron might seek to overthrow this new set of evil lords in the name of establishing the monastery as a place of pure knowledge and balance.": "如果大法师被打败，壁垒峰的权力很可能会发生巨大的转变，很快就会出现新的权力斗争，以争夺对修道院的控制权。如果克滕米尔逃脱或被释放，他可能会回到修道院，占据它作为他的新巢穴。{@creature Mary Greymalkin|LLK}在那里加入他，创造一个邪恶魔法的圣地。如果齿轮箱与修道院有联系，他可能会留在那里，成为这对夫妇不知情的仆人，或者莫德隆可能会以建立修道院作为一个纯粹的知识和平衡的地方为名，寻求推翻这套新的邪恶领主。",
	"Kwalish has long yearned to help the members of his former expedition trapped as brains in jars in the Monastery of the Distressed Body. Knowing that they still survive, he might provide instructions and materials for the characters to return to the monastery and provide the brains with new bodies. And in Daoine Gloine, the characters might entreat the inventor to discover a way to return the vitrified statues of the city to flesh. (If the characters haven't destroyed the undead medusa yet, such means might involve a side quest where they bring Kwalish her severed head.)": "夸里什长期以来一直渴望帮助他以前的探险队成员，他们作为大脑被困在痛苦的身体修道院的罐子里。知道他们还活着，他可能会为人物提供指示和材料，让他们回到修道院，为大脑提供新的身体。而在Daoine Gloine，人物可能会恳求发明家发现一种方法，使城市中的玻璃雕像恢复肉身。(如果人物还没有消灭不死的冥王，这种方法可能会涉及到一个副线任务，他们会把Kwalish的头割下来。）",
	"The Cartophile possesses a good number of treasure maps in his extensive collections—some of which are even accurate. As an added reward for returning with maps and news of Kwalish's original expedition, he might gift one such map to the characters. He might also look to hire the characters for future mapping expeditions, or to undertake specific dangerous missions in exchange for a share of the knowledge or treasure to be found there.": "制图师在他广泛的收藏中拥有大量的藏宝图，其中一些甚至是准确的。作为对带着地图和Kwalish最初探险的消息回来的额外奖励，他可能会把一张这样的地图送给人物。他还可能希望雇佣这些人物进行未来的地图探险，或者承担特定的危险任务，以换取在那里发现的知识或宝藏的份额。",
	"KWALISH LIVES?": "KWALISH的生活？",
	"Since his expedition vanished ages ago, it's prudent to think about how it's possible for Kwalish to be found alive and well in his lab. If the gnome is found trapped inside the powered armor in stasis or scattered throughout his laboratory, the answer is easy. You might also consider that Kwalish's research into the planar craft's magical technology, astral cords, and similar topics might have allowed him to prolong his life indefinitely by magical means. Alternatively, given the inventor's ability to craft lifelike constructs, this version of Kwalish might not be the original gnome at all.": "由于他的探险队在很久以前就消失了，所以我们应该谨慎地思考，怎么可能在他的实验室里发现Kwalish还活着。如果发现地精被困在停滞的动力装甲内，或者散落在他的实验室里，答案就很简单了。你也可以考虑Kwalish对平面飞行器的魔法技术、星际绳索和类似主题的研究可能使他能够通过魔法手段无限期地延长自己的生命。另外，鉴于发明家有能力制作栩栩如生的构造物，这个版本的Kwalish可能根本不是原来的地精。",
	"Characters undertaking this adventure will spend a significant amount of game time on the journey to the Monastery of the Distressed Body and the lost city of Daoine Gloine. You can help bring those weeks of exploration to life with random encounters—some of which might increase or decrease the length of the characters' journey, as you decide.": "进行这次冒险的角色将花费大量的游戏时间在前往苦难之躯修道院和失落之城Daoine Gloine的路上。你可以用随机的遭遇来帮助将这几周的探索变得生动起来--其中一些可能会增加或减少角色的旅程长度，由你决定。",

Or you can roll for or select more detailed encounters using the following tables.": "{@adventure Chapter 2|XGE|-1}的{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}包括随机森林奇遇、地下城奇遇和山区奇遇。或者你可以使用下面的表格来滚动或选择更详细的遭遇。",
	"Reaching the foothills of the Barrier Peaks takes the characters through a broad range of wild lands—including woods infused with the power of the Feywild.": "到达壁垒峰的山脚下时，角色们将穿过一片广阔的荒野之地--包括注入了精灵之力的树林。",
	"A pack of {@creature Sprite||Sprites} pester the party, playing tricks and attempting to steal small items until the characters leave their territory. If they are treated with deference, the sprites might help the characters find the correct path and hurry them along. If assaulted in any way, fifteen {@creature Sprite||Sprites} riding {@creature Stirge||Stirges} attack. (The sprites' invisibility extends to the stirges as well while they are mounted.)": "一群{@creature Sprite||Sprites}纠缠着队伍，玩弄花招，试图偷取小物品，直到人物离开它们的领地。如果对它们敬而远之，这些精灵可能会帮助人物找到正确的道路，并催促他们前进。如果受到任何攻击，15个{@creature Sprite||Sprites}骑{@creature Stirge||Stirges}攻击。(精灵们的隐身能力也延伸到了骑马时的搅拌器上)。",
	"The path leads into a lonely grove that serves as the grave of a former dryad queen. If appropriate respects are paid, the characters have a {@chance 50|50 percent} chance to receive a supernatural gift (see {@book chapter 7|DMG|7|Supernatural Gifts} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG})—a charm that allows a character to cast the {@spell Galder's Tower|LLK|Galder's tower} spell (see {@adventure appendix E|LLK|7}) once as an action.": "这条路通向一个孤独的小树林，那里是一位前干尸女王的坟墓。如果进行了适当的祭奠，人物有{@chance 50|50 percent}的机会获得一份超自然的礼物（见{@book chapter 7|DMG|7|Supernatural Gifts}的{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}）--一个允许人物作为行动施展{@spell Galder's Tower|LLK|Galder's tower}法术（见{@adventure appendix E|LLK|7}）一次的符咒。",
	"A leprechaun (use {@creature Quickling|VGM} statistics from {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}) crosses the characters' path.

	"Some strange creature has wandered down from the Monastery of the Distressed Body. Such creatures might include an ancient security construct gone mad (use {@creature Oaken Bolter|MTF} statistics from {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}) or a {@creature Gibbering Mouther} with a mechanical skull housing its central brain.": "一些奇怪的生物从痛苦的身体的修道院游荡下来。这类生物可能包括一个发疯的古代安全结构（使用{@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}的统计数据）或一个有机械头骨的{@creature Gibbering Mouther}的中央大脑。",
	"The caverns and tunnels of the Barrier Peaks are a treacherous maze that has claimed more than one adventurer. This challenging route might involve cavern encounters that can help flesh out the characters' journey to the Monastery of the Distressed Body.": "屏障峰的洞穴和隧道是一个险恶的迷宫，已经夺走了不止一个冒险者。这条具有挑战性的路线可能涉及到洞穴奇遇，可以帮助充实人物前往苦难之躯修道院的旅程。",
	"A {@creature Xorn} and an {@creature Umber Hulk} hunt as a team, with the umber hulk working to herd characters toward its partner. Alternatively, the xorn and the umber hulk are rivals, with the characters caught in the middle.": "一个{@creature Xorn}和一个{@creature Umber Hulk}作为一个团队进行捕猎，黄褐色绿巨人努力将角色赶向它的伙伴。另一种情况是，Xorn和umber hulk是竞争对手，角色被夹在中间。",
	"The characters' tunnel route leads through the lair of a {@creature Froghemoth|VGM} or some other exotic monstrosity escaped from another planar craft that crashed into the Barrier Peaks long ago.": "人物的隧道路线通向一个{@creature Froghemoth|VGM}或其他异国怪兽的巢穴，这些怪兽是很久以前从另一个坠入壁垒峰的星球飞船中逃出来的。",
	"A monastery work party—six humanoid prisoners ({@creature Commoner||Commoners}) watched by five {@creature Cultist||Cultists} and a {@creature Cult Fanatic}—is seen collecting ore to fuel the monastery's engines. If the prisoners are rescued, they can supply some knowledge of the monastery before fleeing the mountains.": "一个修道院的工作小组，有六个人形囚犯（{@creature Commoner||Commoners}），由五个{@creature Cultist||Cultists}和一个{@creature Cult Fanatic}看着，他们被看到在收集矿石，为修道院的引擎提供燃料。如果这些囚犯被救出来，他们可以在逃离山区之前提供一些关于修道院的知识。",
	"The rocky trails and forbidding passes of the Barrier Peaks hold endless mysteries, and are ripe for random encounters as the characters make their way to Daoine Gloine.": "屏障峰的岩石小径和禁忌通道蕴含着无尽的神秘，在人物前往道恩-格洛因的路上，随机遭遇的机会已经成熟。",
	"The characters discover signs of past expeditions to the Barrier Peaks—the remains of travelers crushed by fallen rocks. If searched, the bodies might still possess useful gear or fragmentary maps showing the layout of Daoine Gloine. But a close inspection shows that some bodies have had part of their flesh melted away (from encounters with wandering ooze-folk).": "角色们发现了过去远征壁垒峰的痕迹--被落石压碎的旅行者的遗体。如果搜查的话，这些尸体可能还拥有有用的装备或显示道恩-格洛因布局的零星地图。但仔细检查会发现，有些尸体的部分肉体已经融化了（因为遇到了流浪的oz-folk）。",
	"A {@creature Galeb Duhr} (sibling to the one in the monastery tunnels) blocks a key route into the lost city of Daoine Gloine. A character must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check for the party to pass. But these galeb duhr have an instinctive knowledge of each other, granting advantage or disadvantage on the check depending on how the other galeb duhr was treated. If the other galeb duhr was killed, this one attacks as soon as the characters are recognized.": "一个{@creature Galeb Duhr}（与修道院隧道里的那个是同胞）阻挡了进入失落之城道恩-格罗因的关键路线。角色必须在DC14魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查中成功，才能通过。但是这些加勒布都尔对彼此有一种本能的了解，在检查中给予优势或劣势，这取决于另一个加勒布都尔被如何对待。如果另一个盖勒布杜尔被杀了，这个人就会在人物被认出后立即攻击。",
	"The starting point for the adventure has a big impact on establishing the full identity of the Cartophile. In Waterdeep, Anaxi Zephries might be a member of that city's Surveyors', Map-, and Chart-makers' Guild. But if the adventure is tied to Chult and {@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA}, he might instead work as a merchant prince in Port Nyanzaru. And either way, no matter how genuinely you portray him, the Cartophile might fall under suspicion by the characters in the manner of so many too-helpful NPCs. You can opt to run with such suspicions by giving the Cartophile a secret agenda.": "冒险的出发点对确定嗜图者的全部身份有很大影响。在Waterdeep，Anaxi Zephries可能是那个城市的测量师、地图和制图师公会的成员。但如果冒险与楚尔特和{@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA}有关，他可能会在尼安萨鲁港做一个商人王子。不管怎么说，不管你如何真诚地描绘他，嗜图者可能会像许多太过热心的NPC一样被人物怀疑。你可以选择通过给嗜车者一个秘密议程来处理这种怀疑。",
	"He might be a criminal agent working for the Monastery of the Distressed Body, sending party after adventuring party to become new prisoners of the Grand Master. He might even be a construct sent from the monastery for that purpose—or his body might be such a construct, and the brain in a jar from the monastery's treasury is actually his. As such, the Cartophile wishes to have it returned at all costs, and any hirelings accompanying the party attempt to complete this secret agenda over any others.": "他可能是一个为 \"痛苦之躯 \"修道院工作的犯罪代理人，将一队又一队的冒险者送去成为大法师的新囚犯。他甚至可能是修道院为此目的派来的构造物--或者他的身体可能就是这样一个构造物，而修道院库房里的罐子里的大脑实际上就是他的。因此，嗜卡者希望不惜一切代价将其归还，而随行的任何雇工都试图完成这一秘密议程而不是其他。",
	"Even if his goals are legitimate, the Cartophile's desire to trace the original expedition of his ancestors might offer further connections to be developed. If one of the brains in jars belongs to one of those relatives and is provided with a new body (see below), it might return to civilization with the characters. The Cartophile will be keen to meet this ancestor, perhaps leading to a new family business. Or considering that they're both gnomes, perhaps Kwalish is the ancestor the Cartophile sought all along!": "即使他的目标是合法的，Cartophile对追踪其祖先最初的远征的渴望也可能提供进一步的联系，以待开发。如果罐子里的一个大脑属于这些亲戚之一，并被提供了一个新的身体（见下文），它可能会和人物一起回到文明社会。嗜车族会很想见见这位祖先，也许会促成新的家族生意。或者考虑到他们都是地精，也许Kwalish就是Cartophile一直在寻找的祖先!",
	"You might also decide that the cards' effects are as closely tied to the adventure as they are because they are really a set of clockwork-controlling punch cards from the crashed planar craft. Whether Gearbox is with the party or not, the cards might be used to connect to any of the technology in the adventure that the modron can interface with. You might also add additional possible effects, such as inserting the correct card into the sphinx's enhanced brain in order to issue it commands. Even if used in these ways, though, a card must first be formally drawn so that its primary effect can play out.": "你也可以决定这些卡片的效果与冒险紧密相连，因为它们实际上是一套来自坠毁的平面飞船的时钟控制打卡机。无论齿轮箱是否和聚会在一起，这些卡片都可以用来连接冒险中的任何技术，而这些技术是modron可以连接的。你还可以增加额外的可能效果，比如将正确的卡片插入斯芬克斯的强化大脑，以便向它发出指令。不过，即使以这些方式使用，也必须首先正式抽出一张牌，以便发挥其主要效果。",
	"Plenty of additional options can be used during the process of resolving the sphinx's riddle, including working with the idea that because the enhanced sphinx gains much new knowledge from outlaws crossing into the monastery, asking about good-aligned topics might negate its advantage on the Intelligence check it makes to answer. Alternatively, you might decide that the dock the sphinx sits on magically fuels its enhanced abilities, and that by tricking or forcing the creature off the dock, it has disadvantage on its Intelligence checks to answer.": "在解决狮身人面像的谜语的过程中，还有很多其他的选择，包括这样的想法：由于增强的狮身人面像从穿越到修道院的歹徒那里获得了很多新的知识，问一些善意的话题可能会否定它在回答问题时的智力检查的优势。另外，你也可以决定狮身人面像所坐的码头为其增强的能力提供了神奇的动力，通过欺骗或迫使该生物离开码头，它在回答问题的智力测验中处于不利地位。",
	"Another obvious option is to allow the characters to trick the sphinx with a logical conundrum, perhaps along the lines of asking: {@i How can we cross to the monastery without paying the toll}? The answer to the question is to ask the question, pressing the sphinx into a strange loop of logic that forces her to let the characters pass. It's also possible that the characters might wish to use the enhanced sphinx to ask a question they truly need to know the answer to, perhaps from some other mystery in your campaign. The sphinx always answers truly, and so can be used to provide rare knowledge or lore if the characters are willing to pay the price.": "另一个明显的选择是让人物用一个逻辑难题来欺骗斯芬克斯，也许可以按照这样的思路来问。{@i How can we cross to the monastery without paying the toll}? 的答案，将狮身人面像压入一个奇怪的逻辑循环，迫使她让人物通过。角色们也有可能希望利用增强的狮身人面像来问一个他们真正需要知道答案的问题，也许是来自你的战役中的其他神秘事件。狮身人面像的回答总是真实的，因此如果角色愿意付出代价，它可以用来提供稀有的知识或传说。",
	"As a custodian of rare knowledge, the sphinx might have long coveted the knowledge of the monastery's brains in jars—all of them creatures with advanced intellect and a unique perspective on the world. She might strike a deal with the characters if they agree to find the brains and bring her one, allowing them to summon the ferry without paying her toll.": "作为稀有知识的守护者，斯芬克斯可能长期以来一直觊觎修道院罐子里的大脑知识--他们都是拥有高级智力和对世界独特视角的生物。她可能会与人物达成协议，如果他们同意找到大脑并给她带来一个，允许他们召唤渡船而无需支付她的费用。",
	"As the leader of the monastery, the Grand Master is meant to present a difficult but not impossible challenge. You might wish to modify his capabilities depending on the relative power of the characters.": "作为寺院的领袖，大法师是为了提出一个困难但并非不可能的挑战。你可能希望根据人物的相对能力来修改他的能力。",
	"Even while keeping the idea that the grand master's claw shards are from a {@item Vorpal Sword}, you might wish to mitigate their threat of an instant kill by having them deal an extra {@dice 6d8} slashing damage instead. You might also have the shards be from a {@item Polymorph Blade|LLK}, a {@item Blade of the Medusa|LLK}, or some other type of weapon.": "即使保持大法师的爪子碎片来自于{@item Vorpal Sword}的想法，你也可能希望通过让它们造成额外的{@dice 6d8}砍击伤害来减轻它们瞬间死亡的威胁。你也可以让这些碎片来自{@item Polymorph Blade|LLK}、{@item Blade of the Medusa|LLK}或其他类型的武器。",
	"The Grand Master might have long ago figured out how to activate this gate. If things go bad for it in combat, it might choose to do so in order to escape (if you wish to preserve the Grand Master as a future villain), or to summon an ally (if the fight against it proves too easy).": "大法师可能早就知道如何启动这道门了。如果在战斗中情况不妙，它可能会选择这样做，以便逃跑（如果你希望保留大法师作为未来的反派），或者召唤盟友（如果与它的战斗证明太容易）。",
	"You could also establish that the process of returning a brain to a new body might require knowledge available only from Kwalish. In this scenario, one or more brains will secure a promise from the characters to return with this knowledge—or they might seek to accompany them onward. The brains can go mobile by attaching their canisters to Gearbox, Ctenmiir's coffin, the merrenoloth's skiff, one of the treasury floating disks made mobile—or even to the characters themselves.": "你还可以确定，将大脑送回新身体的过程可能需要只有Kwalish才能提供的知识。在这种情况下，一个或多个大脑将从人物那里获得承诺，带着这些知识回来，或者他们可能会寻求陪同他们继续前进。大脑可以通过将它们的罐子固定在齿轮箱、Ctenmiir的棺材、Merrenoloth的小船、一个可移动的国库浮动盘上，甚至是人物本身。",
	"If you work with the idea that the sphinx seeks the knowledge held by the brains in jars, the brains know this—and greatly fear that outcome. They might strike a deal with the characters to use their control over the monastery to aid the party—but only if they agree to first go back and slay the sphinx. Once the sphinx is slain—or if the characters killed it before coming to the monastery—any ability checks made to deal with the brains are made with advantage.": "如果你认为狮身人面像在寻找罐子里的大脑所持有的知识，那么大脑知道这一点，并且非常害怕这种结果。他们可能会与角色达成协议，利用他们对修道院的控制来帮助他们--但前提是他们同意先回去杀死斯芬克斯。一旦狮身人面像被杀死，或者如果人物在来到寺院之前就杀死了它，那么任何与大脑打交道的能力检查都是有利的。",
	"A secret entrance might be concealed behind the Grand Master's throne in area M3, opening to reveal a spidery contraption resembling an iron golem, and operating as a climbing elevator down into the lower decks. Another entrance might be concealed within one of the immured ones' cells at area M6. Opening the cell could reveal the entrance standing open, with the prisoner gone and residing somewhere below.": "一个秘密入口可能隐藏在M3区大法师的宝座后面，打开后可以看到一个类似于铁制魔像的蜘蛛网状装置，并可作为攀登电梯下到下层甲板。另一个入口可能隐藏在M6区的一个被囚禁者的牢房里。打开牢房可以发现入口是敞开的，而囚犯已经离开，住在下面的某个地方。",
	"Any such entrance might need to be accessed with one of the {@i deck of several things}' clockwork control cards (see \"{@area Mary Greymalkin|0bd|x},\" above). But however they are reached, these lower levels might contain any number of threats and mysteries: escaped biological specimens, advanced technologies, or even the planar craft's original pilots trapped in stasis. The means to reignite the craft's engines might also be found there if the monastery is in imminent danger of dropping from the sky.": "任何这样的入口都可能需要用{@i deck of several things}的发条控制卡（见上文\"{@area Mary Greymalkin|0bd|x}\"）来进入。但无论如何到达，这些低层可能包含任何数量的威胁和谜团：逃跑的生物标本、先进的技术，甚至是被困在静止状态下的平面飞船的原始飞行员。如果修道院面临着从天上掉下来的危险，重新点燃飞船引擎的方法也可能在那里找到。",
	"As an added challenge to the task of rescuing characters captured by the monks (including those who fall to the valley floor below the monastery), such prisoners might be outfitted with teleportation-field devices around their necks, so that their bodies and heads are separated and imprisoned in two different locations. Characters are fully conscious and ambulatory while in such a state, their heads operating independently of their bodies until both are reunited. See the \"Teleportation-Field Devices\" sidebar for more information.": "作为解救被僧侣俘虏的人物（包括那些掉到寺院下面的谷底的人）的额外挑战，这些囚犯的脖子上可能装有传送场装置，因此他们的身体和头被分开，被囚禁在两个不同的地方。在这种状态下，人物是完全有意识的，而且可以移动，他们的头独立于身体运作，直到两者重新结合。更多信息请参见 \"传送场装置 \"侧栏。",
	"In the ooze-flooded city of Daoine Gloine, the high priest in area O5 might negotiate with the characters for a new physical body. She readily agrees to deactivate the clockwork kraken if the characters open her coffin and help her, suggesting that they drop her into the gelatinous ooze covering the city so that she can sink down and use one of Kwalish's armatures for a new body. However, you might decide that if this is done, the priest's still-potent magical power allows her to merge with the great ooze and control it—effectively using that titanic creature as the new body she seeks.": "在渗水城市Daoine Gloine，O5区的大祭司可能会与角色谈判，以获得新的肉体。如果角色们打开她的棺材并帮助她，她就会欣然同意停用发条克拉肯，并建议他们把她扔进覆盖城市的胶状渗水中，这样她就可以沉下去，用夸利什的一个臂章来换取新的身体。然而，你可以决定，如果这样做了，牧师仍然强大的魔法力量可以让她与巨大的渗出物融合并控制它，从而有效地使用那个巨大的生物作为她寻求的新身体。",
	"As the characters search through the endless baubles of Daoine Gloine, you might want to distinguish the single bauble leading to Kwalish's lab from the other crystal baubles by having it composed of diamond. A successful DC 18 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check spots the difference between the diamond bauble and the other crystal specimens.": "当人物在Daoine Gloine的无尽宝珠中搜寻时，你可能想把通往Kwalish实验室的那个宝珠与其他水晶宝珠区分开来，让它由钻石组成。成功通过DC18智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查，可以发现钻石小饰品和其他水晶标本的区别。",
	"In addition to crafting new options for the encounters inside the baubles, you can set up each bauble so that leaving its extradimensional space requires some sort of victory condition. Such conditions might include killing the wraith in bauble 1, finding a special item in the market in bauble 2, and so forth. You can also increase or decrease the number of decoy baubles throughout the city—or even have baubles taken from the city and hidden throughout the world!": "除了为宝瓶中的遭遇制作新的选择之外，你还可以将每个宝瓶设置为离开其外空间需要某种胜利条件。这些条件可能包括杀死宝瓶1中的巫师，在宝瓶2中的市场上找到一个特殊的物品，等等。你还可以增加或减少整个城市的诱饵宝珠的数量，或者甚至让宝珠从城市中被拿走，藏在世界各地",
	"Additionally, the extradimensional portal Kwalish used to open a gate to the Abyss from Daoine Gloine might be reversible. If the characters meet descendants of the city's original inhabitants, they might be asked to free the city of the ooze, perhaps in exchange for valuable lost lore. Kwalish might also ask for their aid in restoring the city to its former state.": "此外，Kwalish用来从Daoine Gloine打开通往深渊之门的超维门户可能是可逆的。如果人物遇到城市原居民的后裔，他们可能会被要求将城市从淤泥中解放出来，也许是为了交换宝贵的失落的传说。奎利什也可能要求他们协助将城市恢复到以前的状态。",
	"The legendary arcane inventor is presented as an obsessed, distracted, but basically benign figure in the adventure. However, you might choose to present him as a much more sinister villain. Instead of preserving the brains of his fallen comrades in the hope of one day reviving them, Kwalish might have worked with the sphinx to arrange their deaths in order to harvest their brains for his research. Any of the brains in jars in the Monastery of the Distressed Body can detail those events.": "传说中的奥术发明家在冒险中被表现为一个痴迷的、心不在焉的、但基本上是善良的人物。然而，你可以选择将他表现为一个更加阴险的恶棍。夸里什可能与狮身人面像合作，安排他们的死亡，以便为他的研究收集他们的大脑，而不是保存他死去的战友的大脑，希望有一天能使他们复活。窘迫之躯修道院中的任何一个罐子里的大脑都可以详细说明这些事件。",
	"Likewise, instead of flooding Daoine Gloine with ooze in order to save himself from the city's evil cultists, Kwalish might simply have wished to drive away the population and seal off the city for his own use. Descendants of Daoine Gloine's original inhabitants met on the way to the city (see {@adventure appendix A|LLK|4}) can detail these events, as can any revived statues, or even the medusa if the characters use {@spell speak with dead} after ending her threat for good.": "同样地，夸里什并不是为了从城市的邪恶邪教徒手中救出自己而用渗水淹没道恩-格洛因，他可能只是想赶走人口，并将城市封闭起来供自己使用。Daoine Gloine原居民的后代在去往城市的路上遇到的（见{@adventure appendix A|LLK|4}）可以详述这些事件，任何复活的雕像也是如此，甚至如果角色在永远结束美杜莎的威胁后使用{@spell speak with dead}，美杜莎也可以。",
	"If used as a villain, Kwalish should be presented as a final opponent to overcome in his laboratory. Any knowledge required to complete the party's quest can then be found within his journals and personal notes.": "如果作为一个反派，夸里什应该在他的实验室里作为一个最后的对手来克服。完成党的任务所需的任何知识都可以在他的日记和个人笔记中找到。",
	"This section includes new monsters and nonplayer characters introduced in {@i Lost Laboratory of Kwalish}, as well as stat blocks from the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}, and {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF} that are referenced in the adventure.": "这一部分包括在{@i Lost Laboratory of Kwalish}中介绍的新怪物和非玩家角色，以及冒险中引用的{@book Monster Manual|MM}、{@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}和{@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}中的状态块。",
	"The unique magical-mechanical crafting techniques seen in the Monastery of the Distressed Body and the lost city of Daoine Gloine are the basis of a number of unique magic items found in the adventure. Because of their power and rarity, the items in this section (or at least those that aren't cursed) are best suited for characters in a high-magic campaign. Alternatively, treat each item as the equivalent of two or more magic items appropriate for characters of 5th to 10th level.": "在窘迫之躯修道院和失落之城Daoine Gloine看到的独特的魔法-机械制作技术是冒险中发现的许多独特魔法物品的基础。由于它们的威力和稀有性，本节中的物品（或者至少是那些没有被诅咒的物品）最适合于高魔法活动中的角色。或者，将每件物品视为相当于两个或更多适合5-10级角色的魔法物品。",
	"You can also treat this section as potential treasure for future play at higher levels. Some of these items might be experiments that Kwalish is working on, which can be made available to the characters if they return to the Barrier Peaks. Alternatively, if you'd like to make full use of these items during the adventure but don't want to make them part of your long-term campaign, some of them might function only in the monastery or Daoine Gloine, while others might be charge-dependent. When an item's charges run dry, its magic drains away—or the item might malfunction or explode, with effects determined by you.": "你也可以把这部分当作潜在的宝藏，以便将来在更高层次上进行游戏。其中一些物品可能是夸里什正在进行的实验，如果角色们回到屏障山峰，可以让他们获得这些物品。另外，如果你想在冒险过程中充分利用这些物品，但又不想让它们成为长期活动的一部分，那么其中一些物品可能只在修道院或Daoine Gloine中发挥作用，而其他物品可能取决于电荷。当一个物品的电荷耗尽时，它的魔力就会耗尽，或者这个物品可能会发生故障或爆炸，其效果由你决定。",

	"Originally wounded in an encounter that nearly destroyed Kwalish's expedition, the enhanced sphinx was subsequently repaired with magical-mechanical parts—and (unknown to it) programmed by Kwalish to serve his needs and guard this location.

The original bone devil met its demise after Kwalish's exile, when it was drawn into the laboratory's machinery while trying to convert the planar craft into the monastery. This rendered the devil into the treasury's brain in a jar. In the aftermath, the Grand Master's servant Whazzit discovered Kwalish's war machine designs and managed to construct it using the bone devil's exoskeleton. The tiny fiend has kept up this pretense for years, piloting this exoskeleton in the guise of the Grand Master.

See the \"{@adventure Powered Armor Options|LLK|7}\" sidebar in {@adventure appendix D|LLK|7}.": "夸利什(Kwalish)失踪了，在自己的{@i powered armor}中被困在停滞状态中。角色必须首先通过仔细调查盔甲来发现他的位置，然后找到一种方法来操作它的控制器。可以通过成功的DC 16智力({@skill Arcana})检定或使用盗贼工具或修理工具进行的敏捷检定来完成这一任务。另外，那些尝试使用实验室中找到的工具的角色也可以在足够的时间内操作盔甲的控制器。即使在操作了控制器之后，没有人能够靠近盔甲而不触发其自动防御系统。请参阅{@adventure appendix D|LLK|7}中的“{@adventure Powered Armor Options|LLK|7}”侧栏。",
	"If the characters engage Kwalish successfully, or as an added reward if they rescue him, the inventor can use his skill to remove the curse imposed by the enhanced sphinx (whose machinery he created). This restores to normal any ability scores decreased by the sphinx (see {@area area C2|034|x}).": "如果角色成功与考瓦利什(Kwalish)交涉，或者作为额外奖励，如果他们解救了他，这位发明家可以利用他的技能消除被增强狮身人面兽(他创造的机械)施加的诅咒。这将使受狮身人面兽减少的任何能力值恢复正常(见{@area area C2|034|x})。",
	"If negotiations break down, or if the characters take unkindly to Kwalish's cavalier attitude toward life, they might decide to confront and attack him. Kwalish first creates a distraction by releasing the mephits and the mind flayer in his lab as an action. He then turns on the monitor and ducks down to stay out of the medusa's field of view. During the subsequent chaos, the gnome attempts to don the {@i powered armor}, then wreak havoc.": "如果谈判破裂，或者角色们对卡利什(Kwalish)对生命的漫不经心态度感到不满，他们可能决定面对并攻击他。卡利什首先通过释放他实验室里的小恶魔和控制脑鞭者来制造分散注意力的动作。然后他打开监视器，躲到一边避开美杜莎的视线。在随后的混乱中，侏儒试图穿上{@i powered armor}，然后制造混乱。",
	"Ultimately, Kwalish might become a patron of sorts to the party, especially if the {@i powered armor} is loaned out. If any character has bestowed a bit of their soul to the inventor, he promises to return it in exchange for the completion of certain tasks he sets before them (including helping restore his friends). The place of such a valuable and powerful contact in the campaign is yours to determine.": "最终，考瓦利什(Kwalish)可能会成为一种赞助人，尤其是如果{@i powered armor}被借出的话。如果有任何角色将自己的一部分灵魂赐予这位发明家，他承诺会在完成他所设定的某些任务之后归还，这些任务包括帮助恢复他的朋友。在战役中，这样一个宝贵而强大的联系人的地位由你来决定。",
	"To E. Gary Gygax, as author of the original Expedition to the Barrier Peaks (may chocolate and peanut butter forever collide into one another).

	"A {@creature Treant} and a {@creature Stone Golem} were magically locked together during an ancient battle. Over the centuries since, fey gardeners have turned the two into a temple. Characters who explore the temple might inadvertently help the treant or the golem finally overcome its foe.": "在一场古老的战斗中，一个{@creature Treant}和一个{@creature Stone Golem}被魔法锁在一起。自那时以来的几个世纪里，精灵园丁们将这两者转变成了一座寺庙。探索这座寺庙的角色可能会无意中帮助树人或魔像最终战胜它的敌人。",
	"Gathering firewood results in a visit from an angered undead {@creature Treant}. (Use normal statistics, but the creature has the undead type and cannot use its Animate Trees feature).

	"The characters come across a group of roving outlaws (five to ten {@creature Thug||Thugs} led by a {@creature Bandit Captain}), who are heading to the monastery to join its ranks. They possess rumors and fragments of a map, and are keen to steal the characters' resources—especially if {@creature Gearbox|LLK} the modron is present.": "角色们遇到了一群流窜的歹徒（五到十名{@creature Thug||Thugs}由一个{@creature Bandit Captain}领导），他们正前往修道院加入其中。他们掌握着一些谣言和地图碎片，并渴望窃取角色们的资源——尤其是如果{@creature Gearbox|LLK}莫德龙在场的话。",

	"Roving outlaws (five to ten {@creature Thug||Thugs} led by a {@creature Bandit Captain}) heading to the monastery to join its ranks are hopelessly lost in the tunnels.

	"Six prisoners ({@creature Commoner||Commoners}) escaping from the monastery look to the characters for aid. They are pursued by monks (five {@creature Cultist||Cultists} led by a {@creature Cult Fanatic}).

	"A party of monks (five {@creature Cultist||Cultists} led by a {@creature Cult Fanatic}) either survived the characters' assault on the Monastery of the Distressed Body or were away from the monastery and returned to find it routed. They pursue the characters—to try to convince them to take on leadership of the monastery.": "一队僧侣（五名{@creature Cultist||Cultists}由一名{@creature Cult Fanatic}带领）在角色袭击苦难之体修道院时要么幸存下来，要么不在修道院时返回发现它被打败了。他们追随角色——试图说服他们接管修道院的领导权。",
	"A party of surviving monks (five {@creature Cultist||Cultists}) pursues the characters in revenge, led by an escaped {@creature Brain in a jar|LLK} using cobbled-together mechanical gear for mobility.

	"A wandering {@creature Ooze-Folk|LLK} appears, having accidentally trekked out of the city.": "一只流浪的{@creature Ooze-Folk|LLK}出现了，它不小心走出了城市。",
	"An isolated village clings to the mountainside, populated by {@creature Kenku} descended from Daoine Gloine refugees who fled the city when it was flooded with ooze. The kenku still remember ancient legends their forebears told about a cult of the medusa, as well as Kwalish's arrival and the \"plague of ooze.\" However, their ability to speak only in mimicry might make it challenging for the characters to communicate with them. In the course of the conversation, the kenku might mimic the sounds of destruction and screaming heard as the city was overwhelmed, relay the mad ranting of the medusa, and so forth. They might even repeat the words of Kwalish himself as he talks of his extradimensional experiments with glass baubles, and his efforts to hide his lab inside of one.": "一个偏僻的村庄依附在山腰上，居住着{@creature Kenku}，他们是从Daoine Gloine难民后裔中传承下来的，当城市被淤泥淹没时逃离了。肯库人仍然记得他们的祖先讲述的关于美杜莎教派的古老传说，以及奎利什的到来和“淤泥之疫”。然而，他们只能模仿说话的能力可能会让角色们与他们交流变得具有挑战性。在交谈过程中，肯库人可能会模仿城市被淹没时听到的毁灭和尖叫声，传达美杜莎的疯狂咆哮等。他们甚至可能会重复奎利什自己的话，当他谈论他用玻璃小球进行的超维实验，以及他努力将实验室隐藏在其中的时候。",
	"The wide-open nature of this adventure, the optional setups provided in the \"Adventure Length\" and \"First Things Last\" sidebars, and the options in the \"Meeting Kwalish\" section give you the opportunity to run {@i Lost Laboratory of Kwalish} in a number of different ways. But if you'd like to customize this scenario even further, consider any of the following options.": "在这个冒险的广阔性质，以及在“冒险长度”和“最后的第一件事”侧边栏中提供的可选设置，以及“会见奎利什”部分中的选项，让你有机会以多种不同的方式进行{@i Lost Laboratory of Kwalish}。但如果你想要进一步定制这个情节，考虑以下任何一个选项。",
	"A number of options present themselves for using the {@i deck of several things} within the adventure. As written, Mary already carries the deck, and no matter how many cards are drawn from it, the complete deck reappears magically in her possession at the conclusion of the adventure. But if she remains as an NPC in your campaign, or is first placed in an earlier adventure, consider modifying the cards' effects to more broadly fit the campaign.": "在冒险中有几种选项可供使用{@i deck of several things}。按照原文，玛丽已经携带这副牌，无论从中抽取多少张牌，整副牌在冒险结束时都会神奇地重新出现在她手中。但如果她在你的战役中保持为NPC，或者首次出现在早期的冒险中，请考虑修改这些牌的效果，使其更广泛地适用于整个战役。",
	"Additionally (and especially if the characters don't choose to take Mary as a hireling), the {@i deck of several things} might not be in her possession. Instead, characters can find the cards scattered in various locations throughout the adventure, allowing them to be collected, then used.": "另外（尤其是如果角色们选择不雇佣Mary），{@i deck of several things}可能不在她的手中。相反，角色们可以在冒险中的各个地方找到散落的卡片，收集起来后再使用。",
	"If the sphinx is slain, the mechanical items that circle around her (functioning as {@item Ioun Stone|LLK|Ioun stones}) might all be released. The life force they contain (in the form of decreases to ability scores) might then be usable by their original owners to reverse the decrease. If any of those owners are still alive, the stones might help guide the characters to them, allowing the party to gain favor by returning the sphinx's toll to some of those who have paid it. If Mary is with the party, she might seek to keep all the mechanical {@item Ioun Stone|LLK|Ioun stones} for herself—and might stop at nothing to get them back if the other characters seize them.": "如果狮身人面像被杀死，围绕她的机械物品（作为{@item Ioun Stone|LLK|Ioun stones}运转）可能会全部释放。它们所包含的生命力（以减少属性分数的形式）可能会被它们的原始所有者使用，以扭转这种减少。如果这些所有者中有任何人仍然活着，这些石头可能会帮助引导角色找到他们，让队伍通过将狮身人面像的通行费归还给其中一些人而获得好感。如果玛丽与队伍在一起，她可能会试图将所有的机械{@item Ioun Stone|LLK|Ioun stones}留给自己，并且如果其他角色夺走它们，她可能会不择手段地夺回它们。",
	"Another option is to allow decapitated characters to have their heads magically reattached and their life restored at the leather works, through the advice of the control room brains or Kwalish's notes. Similarly, you might have notes and technology found throughout the adventure that allow the characters to recreate the {@item Vorpal Sword} successfully if the shards are recovered.": "另一个选择是允许被斩首的角色在制革作坊通过控制室大脑或者奎利什的笔记的建议，让他们的头部被魔法重新接回，生命得以恢复。同样地，你可能会在整个冒险中找到笔记和技术，让角色在成功找回碎片后重新创造{@item Vorpal Sword}。",
	"If an added threat is needed, you might have the Grand Master's cloak fly apart into its various faces during battle, attacking as a {@creature swarm of bats}.": "如果需要增加威胁，你可以让大师长的斗篷在战斗中分裂成各种面孔，作为一个{@creature swarm of bats}攻击。",
	"Depending on your campaign, you might wish to identify some or all of the monastery's brains with other figures from D&D lore. Perhaps the monastery has long been home to obscure or lesser-known figures such as Quaal, Queen Ehlissa, Keoghtom, Nolzur, and Tuerny the Merciless—all of them known mostly for the magic items that bear their names. If you use Nolzur, the creator of {@item Nolzur's Marvelous Pigments} would be of special interest to Garret, while Tuerny (creator of the lost artifact {@i The {@item Iron Flask} of Tuerny the Merciless}) would be of special interest to {@creature Mary Greymalkin|LLK}.": "根据你的战役情况，你可能希望将一些或所有的僧院的智者与D&D传说中的其他人物联系起来。也许这个僧院长期以来一直是一些鲜为人知的或不太出名的人物的家园，比如Quaal, Queen Ehlissa, Keoghtom, Nolzur和Tuerny the Merciless，他们大多因为以他们名字命名的魔法物品而闻名。如果你使用Nolzur，作为{@item Nolzur's Marvelous Pigments}的创造者将对Garret特别感兴趣，而Tuerny（创造了失落神器Tuerny the Merciless {@i The {@item Iron Flask}）将对{@creature Mary Greymalkin|LLK}特别感兴趣。",
	"Every brain in a jar is desperate for a new body, and a brain immediately agrees to aid the characters any way it can if they promise to restore it to life. Any number of possible options might be available to characters wanting to achieve this end. Most easily, the brains can guide characters through the process of transferring their intellect into a host such as a slain monk, or a mechanical entity such as Ctenmiir's coffin or {@creature Gearbox|LLK}. This process requires a successful DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check or Dexterity check with thieves' tools or tinker's tools. However, on a failed check, the brain is destroyed and any floating disks it controls in the treasury (area M10) are permanently deactivated.": "每个罐中的大脑都渴望一个新的身体，一个大脑立即同意帮助角色们，只要他们答应将其复活。角色们想要实现这一目标可能有多种选择。最简单的方法是，这些大脑可以指导角色们将他们的智慧转移到一个宿主身上，比如一个被杀死的僧侣，或者一个机械实体，比如Ctenmiir的棺材或者{@creature Gearbox|LLK}。这个过程需要成功通过DC 14的智力({@skill Medicine})检定或者使用盗贼工具或修理工具进行敏捷检定。然而，如果检定失败，大脑将被摧毁，并且它在宝库（M10区域）中控制的任何漂浮盘都将永久停用。",
	"The characters might also attempt to craft an entirely new mechanical body as a brain host—either individual bodies for each brain, or a single body that houses all the brains at once. Doing so requires a suitable amount of time, access to materials, and a successful DC 16 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check or Dexterity check with thieves' tools or tinker's tools. Furthermore, each such body also requires a new energy cell from the treasury.": "角色们也可能尝试制作一个全新的机械身体作为大脑的宿主——可以是为每个大脑制作单独的身体，也可以是一个同时容纳所有大脑的身体。这样做需要足够的时间、材料，并且需要通过一次成功的 DC 16 智力检定（{@skill Arcana}）或使用盗贼工具或工匠工具进行敏捷检定。此外，每个这样的身体还需要从宝库中取出一个新的能量电池。",
	"You could also establish that the process of returning a brain to a new body might require knowledge available only from Kwalish. In this scenario, one or more brains will secure a promise from the characters to return with this knowledge—or they might seek to accompany them onward. The brains can go mobile by attaching their canisters to {@creature Gearbox|LLK}, Ctenmiir's coffin, the merrenoloth's skiff, one of the treasury floating disks made mobile—or even to the characters themselves.": "你也可以设定，将大脑放回新身体的过程可能需要只有库奥利什(Kwalish)才知道的知识。在这种情况下，一个或多个大脑会要求角色们承诺带着这个知识回来，或者他们可能想要继续与他们同行。这些大脑可以通过将他们的罐子连接到{@creature Gearbox|LLK}、Ctenmiir的棺材、梅伦诺洛斯的轻舟、其中一个移动的财宝浮盘，甚至连接到角色们自己来移动。",
	"The original {@i Expedition to the Barrier Peaks} mapped out six levels of the adventure's crashed ship: \"a large exploration-colonization expedition of human origin.\" This adventure focuses on only a cursory exploration of a similarly crashed planar craft, but you can easily expand the adventure by allowing characters to discover portals in the monastery that lead to lower levels of the vessel.": "原始{@i Expedition to the Barrier Peaks}描述了冒险中坠毁飞船的六个级别：“一个人类探险殖民的大型远征队。” 这个冒险仅侧重于对类似坠毁的位面飞船进行粗略探索，但您可以通过允许角色在修道院发现通往飞船更低级别的传送门来轻松扩展冒险。",
	"Opening either of these devices (in the central abbey or the tomb of the medusa) creates the effect of casting a {@spell gate} spell. As per that spell, the characters might wish to name a specific creature from the plane the gate leads to, hoping to interact with it. Or you might have a creature Kwalish previously met through the gate arrive in response to it being opened. That creature might have knowledge to impart, a debt to repay, or a grudge to have righted. You could even have creatures from the two gates know of each another—and, as with the monastery's sphinx and brains in jars—attempt to work with the characters against one another.": "打开这两个装置中的任何一个（在中央修道院或美杜莎之墓）会产生施放{@spell gate}法术的效果。根据该法术，角色可能希望命名来自传送门所通往平面的特定生物，希望与之互动。或者你可以让之前通过传送门遇到过的生物Kwalish作为回应而出现。那个生物可能有知识要传授、债务要偿还，或者怨恨要平复。你甚至可以让来自两个传送门的生物彼此知晓——就像修道院里的狮身人面像和大罐中的脑袋——试图让角色彼此对抗。",
	"If the undead medusa guarding area O4 is overcome, the crown and scepter recovered from the monastery can be used to open the temple gate, as noted in the adventure. A follow-up successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check can then trigger ritual magic that reverses the flood of ooze and sends it back to the Slime Pits. However, if this check is failed by 5 or more, the botched ritual summons forth a new plague of acidic slime—so potent that it quickly melts the stone of the city away, destroying Daoine Gloine for all time.": "如果成功克服守卫O4区域的不死美杜莎，从修道院中找回的王冠和权杖可以用来打开神殿的大门，正如冒险中所指出的。接着，一个成功的DC 15智力检定({@skill Religion})可以触发仪式魔法，逆转黏液的洪水并将其送回粘液坑。然而，如果这个检定失败了5点或更多，失败的仪式会召唤出一波新的酸性黏液瘟疫——它如此强大，以至于迅速将城市的石头融化，永远毁灭Daoine Gloine。",
	"To raise the stakes for characters attempting to activate or reverse the abyssal gate, you can also require that the character wearing the crown and holding the scepter must be in physical contact with the standing arch—making it impossible to activate the gate from inside the {@item Apparatus of Kwalish} or any similar protective device.": "为了增加角色尝试激活或逆转深渊之门的难度，你也可以要求戴着皇冠并握着权杖的角色必须与立在那里的拱门保持身体接触——这样就不可能从{@item Apparatus of Kwalish}内部或任何类似的防护装置中激活门。",
	"The \"{@book Alien Technology|DMG|9|Alien Technology}\" section in chapter 9 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} offers useful general guidelines for dealing with strange devices of the sort found in this adventure. If Kwalish's notes can't be deciphered (or if the inventor doesn't show up when the characters need him), you might ask for successful Intelligence checks on the Figuring Out Alien Technology table from anyone trying to operate magical technology. It might take one success to operate a trinket, two successes to operate a force pike or a teleportation-field device, and four successes to operate Kwalish's {@i powered armor}.": "在第9章中，{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}的“{@book Alien Technology|DMG|9|Alien Technology}”部分提供了有用的一般指导，用于处理类似冒险中发现的奇怪装置。如果无法解密奎利什的笔记（或者当角色需要时发明者没有出现），你可以要求任何尝试操作魔法技术的人在《弄清外星科技》表上进行成功的智力检定。可能需要一个成功来操作一个小玩意，两个成功来操作一把力场矛或传送场装置，以及四个成功来操作奎利什的{@i powered armor}。",
