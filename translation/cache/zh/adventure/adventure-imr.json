	"A fallen clock tower holds components from an ancient artifact. Upon discovery of the components, competing agents look to launch expeditions to uncover additional components scattered across distant places—and times. The now-lost Temple of Moloch and the construction site of the legendary {@adventure Tomb of Horrors|TftYP} are two of those locations. However great the risks, finding the components demands the effort, for whoever does so can reassemble the fabled {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad!}": "一座倒下的钟楼里有一个古代艺术品的部件。在发现这些部件后，相互竞争的特工们希望发起探险，以发现散落在遥远的地方和时间的其他部件。现在已经消失的摩洛神庙和传说中的{@adventure Tomb of Horrors|TftYP}的建筑工地就是其中的两个地点。无论风险有多大，找到这些组件都需要付出努力，因为谁找到了，谁就能重新组装传说中的{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad!}。",

However, Kwalish was not the first explorer to do so.": "几百年前，一个来历不明的平面飞行器坠落在壁垒山峰内。学者Kwalish后来发现了这个飞船，将其改造成自己的实验室，研究其技术，为自己的实验提供动力。然而，夸里什并不是第一个这样做的探险家。",
	"Earlier expeditions also chanced upon the crash site, and although most parties perished while delving through the craft, a few managed to recover rare objects never conceived by even the greatest minds of this world. Many of these objects were subsequently lost over time—and most resulted in the deaths of their owners along the way. But a few persisted, controlled by those able to glean some partial understanding of their operation.": "早期的探险队也偶然发现了坠机地点，虽然大多数探险队在钻研飞船时丧生，但也有少数人设法找到了这个世界上最伟大的思想家都没有想到的稀有物品。这些物品中的许多后来随着时间的推移而丢失，大多数导致其主人在途中死亡。但也有少数人坚持了下来，被那些能够对其运作有部分了解的人所控制。",
	"Among the most important of these relics was the planar craft's central command console, used to guide its flight through space and time. Legend of this object grew as it fell into the hands of a warlord and came to be known as a most powerful artifact: the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad} (so named after its last owner). Yet with the defeat of Baron Lum, his {@i Infernal Machine} was said to have been destroyed as well.": "这些遗物中最重要的是平面飞行器的中央指挥台，用来指导它在空间和时间中的飞行。当这个东西落入一个军阀手中时，它的传说越来越多，被称为最强大的神器：{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}（以其最后的主人命名）。然而，随着卢姆男爵的失败，他的{@i Infernal Machine}据说也被摧毁了。",
	"Currently, the archdevils Zariel and Bel both have designs on rebuilding Lum's infernal machine. Zariel is the present master of Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. Bel is the deposed former master of that layer. But to rebuild the infernal machine, both devils require a number of missing components—former control buttons vital to the machine's operation. Zariel and Bel have both planted agents in the world, tasking those agents with finding adventurers to track down and claim these components. Once the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad} is complete, whichever devil controls it plans to use the machine to claim final dominion over Avernus.": "目前，大恶魔扎里尔和贝尔都有重建卢姆的地狱机器的打算。扎里尔是九层地狱的第一层阿弗纳斯的现任主人。贝尔是被废黜的该层的前主人。但要重建无间道机器，两个魔鬼都需要一些缺失的部件--对机器的运作至关重要的前控制按钮。扎里尔和贝尔都在这个世界上安插了代理人，让这些代理人负责寻找冒险者来追踪和索取这些部件。一旦{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}完成，无论哪个魔鬼控制它，都计划利用机器对Avernus进行最终统治。",
	"While journeying through fey woods, the characters must choose whether to help a trio of (supposed) dryads or a unicorn, with each faction blaming the other for the woods' corruption.

	"The Temple of Moloch derives from the sample dungeon map appearing in the first edition Dungeon Masters Guide of 1979, and includes the famed statue of Moloch featured on the cover of the first edition Players Handbook from 1978.

Kwalish has long researched legends about the missing components of the {@i Infernal Machine} scattered across the world. Reaching out to the characters, he tasks them with recovering the missing components, with {@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR} and {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} serving as rivals along the way. Kwalish can then send the characters out to investigate the manor of one or both agents, wanting to know how far along each agent is in their reconstruction of the {@i Infernal Machine}.": "作为{@i Lost Laboratory of Kwalish}的延续，你可以用这位传奇的发明家来代替这次冒险的代理人，{@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR}和{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}。夸里什长期研究关于散落在世界各地的{@i Infernal Machine}失踪部件的传说。他向这些人物伸出援手，让他们负责找回丢失的部件，而{@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR}和{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}则是沿途的对手。然后，Kwalish可以派人物去调查一个或两个特工的庄园，想知道每个特工在重建{@i Infernal Machine}方面进展如何。",

	"To enter Candlekeep in {@i Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus}, the characters need a book or scroll that isn't already in the library's vast archives.

	"The hags of {@adventure chapter 1|IMR|1} might also be in contact with Mad Maggie. Instead of working for either agent, the characters could be tasked with collecting the missing components for Mad Maggie's outpost.

	"Traveling to the distant past, the characters explore a version of the Tomb of Horrors still under construction. To obtain the missing components, they must contend with the tomb's architect, {@creature Moghadam|IMR}, and disrupt the evil ceremony that keeps a powerful balor imprisoned.": "旅行到遥远的过去，人物探索一个仍在建设中的恐怖之墓的版本。为了获得缺失的部件，他们必须与古墓的建筑师{@creature Moghadam|IMR}抗争，并破坏将一个强大的巴洛克人囚禁起来的邪恶仪式。",

	"Whichever hook you choose, the adventure begins while the characters are traveling through a remote fey wood. If {@i Infernal Machine Rebuild} is played in combination with {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}, this could be part of the thick band of woods surrounding the pass leading into the Barrier Peaks, known to be infused with the power of the Feywild. The High Forest in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, the Svalich Woods in Barovia, or Xen'drik in Eberron also make excellent starting points.": "无论你选择哪种钩子，冒险都是在人物穿越一个遥远的费伊森林时开始的。如果{@i Infernal Machine Rebuild}与{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}结合使用，这可能是通往屏障山峰的山口周围茂密树林的一部分，众所周知，它被注入了精灵的力量。被遗忘的领域》战役设定中的高森林，巴罗维亚的斯瓦里奇森林，或者《艾伯伦》中的Xen'drik也是很好的起点。",
	"A large section of a fey-infused woodland has fallen under the control of a coven of green hags. Using dark gardening techniques, the hags have grafted myconids into the trees of the wood, creating dangerous hybrids and a spreading corruption.": "一片被精灵感染的林地的很大一部分已经落入了一个绿衣女巫团的控制之下。利用黑暗的园艺技术，女巫们将菌类嫁接到树林的树木上，创造出危险的杂交种和蔓延的腐败。",
	"Opposing the hags' evil is a female unicorn named Banrion. After years of skirmishes, the hags have driven Banrion to an isolated pinnacle of rock. This pinnacle stands among the ruins of an ancient city that once housed the {@i Infernal Machine}, until Baron Lum the Mad discovered and claimed it for himself. A fallen clock tower still holds some of the machine's components, which retain enough power to manipulate time.": "与女巫们的邪恶相对立的是一只名叫班里昂的女独角兽。经过多年的小规模冲突，女巫们把班里昂赶到了一个孤立的岩石顶峰。这座山峰矗立在一座古城的废墟中，这座城市曾经是{@i Infernal Machine}的所在地，直到疯狂男爵卢姆发现并将其据为己有。一座倒下的钟楼仍然保存着机器的一些部件，它们保留了足够的力量来操纵时间。",
	"In addition to mundane animals, these woods are populated by numerous fey creatures (including dryads, pixies, sprites, and satyrs). These fey have taken sides in the conflict between the unicorn and the hags, with those corrupted by the hags having gained control over the woods.": "除了世俗的动物之外，这些森林里还居住着许多精灵生物（包括干尸、小精灵、精灵和萨提尔）。这些精灵在独角兽和女巫的冲突中站在了一边，那些被女巫腐蚀的精灵获得了对森林的控制。",

	"Three hags form a coven, which results in heightened power. For higher-level characters, run the hags with their coven benefits to make a hard encounter. For lower-level parties, consider removing the coven's Shared Spellcasting. This feature is something the hags gain only after capturing Banrion.": "三个女巫组成了一个巫师团，这导致了力量的增强。对于高等级的角色来说，使用女巫们的巫师团利益来制造一个困难的遭遇。对于低级别的队伍来说，可以考虑取消女巫团的共享法术。这个功能是女巫们在俘获班瑞恩后才获得的。",
	"As the guardian of the fey woods, the {@creature unicorn} Banrion has grown weary in her losing battle against the hags, and remains effectively confined to the rocky plateau that is her lair.

	"The hags are not to be trusted, and characters (not to mention players) are often wise to be suspicious even at the best of times. You can adjust the encounters with the dryad-hags according to the players' reactions as you see fit.

Or if the characters travel to the cottage and suss out the hags' true nature, the hags might try to threaten the characters into capturing Banrion, or claim that the unicorn is a greater evil—one that might destroy the woods if left unchecked.

In their illusory guise as dryads, they offer the characters shelter and delicious food, as well as a healing tea that fully heals any damage or effects from the hazards activated by the sunbeams.": "雄鹿妈妈介绍了臭鼬妈妈和鼹鼠妈妈，以及她们的助手Olitor（如果人物还没有见过）。他们以虚幻的干尸身份，为人物提供住所和美味的食物，以及一种治疗茶，可以完全治疗由太阳光激活的危险所造成的任何伤害或影响。",
	"When the characters have partaken of any aid they wish to take, Mother Stag explains that the woods protected by the three mothers have fallen under the influence of an evil unicorn.": "当人物吃完他们想吃的任何援助后，雄鹿妈妈解释说，由三位母亲保护的森林已经陷入了邪恶独角兽的影响。",
	"\"Just as goodly deities assign unicorns to protect sacred places,\" Mother Stag explains, \"Banrion serves an evil god, who sent her to corrupt these peaceful woods. Since her arrival, the dark-hearted unicorn has hunted goodly fey into near extinction, with the help of evil creatures that now serve her.\"": "\"就像善良的神灵指派独角兽保护圣地一样，\"雄鹿妈妈解释说，\"班瑞恩为一个邪恶的神灵服务，后者派她来破坏这些和平的森林。自从她来到这里，这只黑心的独角兽在现在为她服务的邪恶生物的帮助下，已经把善良的费伊人猎杀到几乎灭绝。\"",
	"The three mothers offer to serve as guides, leading the characters safely through the woods to their original destination. But in exchange, they ask for assistance in defeating this evil unicorn. They do not want Banrion killed, however. Instead, if the characters can capture the unicorn, Mother Stag claims that they can undo her corruption—and perhaps even convert her to more goodly ways. (In reality, the hags wish to capture the unicorn and force her to become their servant and mount.)": "三位母亲主动提出充当向导，带领人物安全地穿过森林，到达他们原来的目的地。但作为交换，她们要求帮助她们打败这个邪恶的独角兽。然而，她们并不希望班瑞恩被杀。相反，如果角色们能抓住独角兽，雄鹿妈妈声称他们可以消除她的腐败--甚至可能让她改邪归正。(实际上，雄鹿们希望抓住独角兽，强迫她成为他们的仆人和坐骑）。",
	"To help the characters in this task, the three mothers have corrupted a {@item bridle of capturing|IMR} (see {@adventure appendix C|IMR|8}), which can control the unicorn and allow it to be led back to them. (Even though the bridle normally targets only beasts, the hags' magic allows this bridle to target Banrion specifically.)": "为了帮助人物完成这项任务，三位母亲腐蚀了一个{@item bridle of capturing|IMR}（见{@adventure appendix C|IMR|8}），它可以控制独角兽，让它被引回他们身边。(尽管辔头通常只针对野兽，但女巫们的魔法使这个辔头可以专门针对班瑞恩)。",
	"If a crown is closely examined by a character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) or Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, or with a {@spell detect magic} spell cast using a 3rd-level or higher spell slot, the nature of its magic is discovered.": "如果一个角色在DC20智力（{@skill Nature}）或智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查中成功地仔细检查了王冠，或者用3级以上的法术槽施展了{@spell detect magic}法术，它的魔法性质就会被发现。",
	"The dryad-hags lead the characters toward the clock tower bridge, but are too frightened of the unicorn to approach any closer. They leave Olitor to guide the characters the rest of the way. The satyr-redcap leads the characters to the edge of the ruins before sneaking off to hide and spy on their progress.": "干尸巫师带领人物走向钟楼桥，但他们太害怕独角兽了，不敢再靠近了。他们留下了Olitor来引导角色走完剩下的路。萨提尔-红帽带领角色们来到废墟的边缘，然后偷偷地躲起来，窥视他们的进展。",
	"As the characters make their way toward Banrion's lair, they come across the ruins of an old clock tower, which make an unusual and dangerous bridge.": "当人物向班瑞恩的巢穴进发时，他们遇到了一座旧钟楼的废墟，它是一座不寻常的危险桥梁。",
	"The trees part to reveal the ruins of an ancient city. All that remains are worn flagstones covered in moss and lichen, toppled blocks of weathered stone, and a former tower fallen and now lying stretched across a fifty-foot-wide chasm.": "树木分开，露出了一座古城的废墟。剩下的只是覆盖着苔藓和地衣的破旧旗杆石，倒下的风化石块，以及一座曾经倒下的塔，现在横卧在50英尺宽的鸿沟中。",
	"The chasm fully circles an isolated plateau of rock at its center. More ruins rise atop this plateau, including sections of walls held together by the roots of stunted trees. On the near side of the chasm, the base of the fallen tower can be seen, reduced to a broken section of its former ground floor. ": "鸿沟完全环绕着其中心的一个孤立的岩石高原。更多的废墟耸立在这个高原上，包括由矮小的树根支撑起来的部分墙壁。在鸿沟的近旁，可以看到倒下的塔的底座，只剩下以前地面上的一段断裂。",
	"The collapsed structure crosses the 100-foot-deep chasm and appears extremely unstable. (Banrion can teleport across the chasm, but does so only rarely. Because she can teleport only once per day, she is wary of being stuck on the other side if the hags' servants are nearby.) The foundation of the tower still rests on the forest side of the chasm—and holds the instrument panel that formerly operated the tower's time mechanism.": "坍塌的结构横跨100英尺深的鸿沟，看起来极其不稳定。(Banrion可以传送过鸿沟，但只是很少这样做。因为她每天只能传送一次，如果女巫的仆人在附近，她就会警惕地被卡在另一边）。塔的地基仍然在鸿沟的森林一侧，并保留着以前操作塔的时间机制的仪表板。",
	"The characters can attempt to cross over using the fallen tower as a bridge, or they might discover the controls within the foundation that allow the bridge to be stabilized.": "角色们可以尝试利用倒下的塔作为桥梁越过，或者他们可能会发现地基内的控制装置，使桥梁得以稳定。",
	"A character can attempt to cross the chasm using the exterior of the fallen clock tower as a bridge, or using its interior as a tunnel. Either way, the character must succeed on two DC 14 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) checks to safely cross. Characters who are roped together gain no benefit for these checks, but are in a better position to help each other if one falls.": "一个角色可以尝试用倒下的钟楼的外部作为桥梁，或者用它的内部作为隧道来跨越鸿沟。无论哪种方式，角色都必须通过两次DC14的灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）检查才能安全穿越。被绑在一起的角色在这些检查中没有任何好处，但是如果有一个人掉下去，他们会处于更好的位置来帮助对方。",
	"On a first failed check, pieces of the tower crumble and fall 100 feet to the bottom of the chasm, but the character is unharmed. On a second failed check, more crumbling rock trips up or batters the character, who takes 4 ({@dice 1d8}) bludgeoning damage and falls. A character who is not roped to another character or some solid part of the tower falls 100 feet, taking {@dice 10d6} bludgeoning damage.": "在第一次检查失败的情况下，塔的碎片碎裂并掉落到100英尺的鸿沟底部，但角色没有受到伤害。在第二次检查失败时，更多的碎石会绊倒或撞击角色，角色会受到4({@dice 1d8})的重击伤害并坠落。没有被绳索绑在另一个角色或塔的某个坚固部分上的角色会跌落100英尺，受到{@dice 10d6}重击伤害。",
	"If failed checks cause significant sections of the tower to crumble, you might decide that the DC of the check to climb across increases, or that checks are made with disadvantage.": "如果检查失败导致塔的重要部分崩塌，你可能会决定增加爬过塔的检查DC，或者以劣势进行检查。",
	"Within the foundation of the tower on the near side of the chasm, an instrument panel is built into the wall. Characters who have seen the planar craft in {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK} recognize the design of the panel, as well as the silver wires that connect it to the rest of the tower structure.": "在鸿沟近旁的塔基内，墙内有一个仪表板。见过{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}的平面飞行器的人物可以认出这个面板的设计，以及连接它和塔的其他结构的银色电线。",
	"A successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) or Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check notices two gemstone-like buttons lying on the ground nearby, one a deep red and one a light blue, and both made of some unknown material. The buttons are two of the missing components of the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}, as the characters will discover.": "成功通过DC10智力({@skill Investigation})或智慧({@skill Perception})检查，可以注意到附近地面上躺着两个类似宝石的按钮，一个是深红色，一个是浅蓝色，都是由某种未知的材料制成。钮扣是{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}的两个缺失的部件，人物会发现这一点。",
	"Two empty slots in the panel once housed the components before they fell loose. A successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check identifies the components as associated with the transmutation school of magic—and specifically, with the transmutation of time. If the components are placed back in the panel, a successful DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check allows them to be used to adjust a localized time field surrounding the tower in either direction.": "在面板上有两个空槽，在它们松动之前曾经放置过这些组件。成功通过DC12智力({@skill Arcana})检查，可以确定这些组件与魔法的转化学派有关，特别是与时间的转化有关。如果这些组件被放回面板中，成功通过DC14智力({@skill Arcana})检查，就可以用它们来调整塔周围任何方向的局部时间场。",
	"The red component allows the time field to be adjusted toward the future. If the check to do so is successful, the tower begins to rapidly age and crumble. If advanced too far, or if any check made to operate the red component is failed by 10 or more, the tower collapses into the valley with a resounding crash.": "红色部分允许时间场向未来调整。如果这样做的检查成功，塔开始迅速老化和崩溃。如果推进得太远，或者任何操作红色组件的检查都失败了10次或更多，塔就会在巨大的撞击声中倒塌到山谷中。",
	"The blue component allows the time field to be adjusted toward the past. If the check to do so is successful, the tower begins to revert back to its original condition. If this process is stopped before the tower returns to its standing position, it becomes a stable bridge that can be crossed without ability checks.": "蓝色组件允许时间场向过去调整。如果这样做的检查是成功的，塔就开始恢复到它的原始状态。如果这个过程在塔回到它的站立位置之前被阻止，它就会变成一座稳定的桥，无需能力检查就可以通过。",
	"Adjusting the time field affects only the tower. Other creatures and objects that might happen to be in or on the tower at the time remain unaffected.": "调整时间场只影响到塔。当时可能碰巧在塔内或塔上的其他生物和物体仍然不受影响。",
	"The rocky plateau beyond the chasm holds the crumbled shell of an ancient castle. Banrion the unicorn makes her home here, along with a number of goodly fey who shelter in a network of tiny tunnels within the ruins. Having long been hunted by the hags and their evil servants, these fey—including sprites, pixies, and good boggles and satyrs—are too weak and terrified to help in any fight.": "鸿沟外的岩石高原上有一座古老城堡的碎裂外壳。独角兽班瑞恩在这里安家，还有一些在废墟中的小隧道网络中避难的善良的费伊人。由于长期被女巫和她们邪恶的仆人追杀，这些精灵--包括精灵、小精灵、善良的博格和萨提尔--都太过虚弱和恐惧，无法帮助任何战斗。",
	"The {@creature unicorn} Banrion defends her home and its inhabitants with her life. If the characters threaten or attack her here, she fights to the finish, refusing to teleport away. But if the characters have peaceful intent (most likely because they saw through the dryad-hags' ruse, or they simply want to assess Banrion's nature themselves), they can approach unarmed and announcing themselves. With appropriate roleplaying or a DC 16 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, Banrion accepts that the characters mean her no harm. If the hags are still at large, she beseeches the characters to help her defeat them.": "{@creature unicorn}班瑞恩用她的生命来保卫她的家园和居民。如果角色在这里威胁或攻击她，她会战斗到底，拒绝传送离开。但是如果角色有和平的意图（很可能是因为他们看穿了干尸巫师的诡计，或者他们只是想自己评估一下Banrion的本性），他们可以不带武器地接近并宣布自己。通过适当的角色扮演或DC16魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查，班瑞恩接受了这些角色对她没有恶意。如果女巫仍然逍遥法外，她恳求这些人物帮助她打败她们。",
	"If the characters agree to fight the hags, Banrion joins them. But she asks that before the fight, the characters help escort the fey living in the ruins across the bridge, then manipulate the fallen clock tower back to its standing position. This seals off her plateau defensively, denying it to the hags in case she falls. (If she survives, the unicorn remains able to teleport across the chasm.) In this way, the characters discover the tower's controls if they have not already.": "如果角色们同意与女巫作战，班瑞恩会加入他们。但她要求在战斗前，角色们帮助护送住在废墟中的费伊人过桥，然后操纵倒下的钟楼回到其站立位置。这样就可以防御性地封住她的高原，万一她倒下了，就会被女巫们拒绝。(如果她能活下来，独角兽仍能传送到鸿沟对面。）通过这种方式，角色们发现了塔的控制权，如果他们还没有的话。",
	"If asked, Banrion knows only that the clock tower was once part of an ancient city. She describes its controls as \"a magical machine of gems and silver,\" but has not approached too closely for fear of the magic it radiates. As for who built the city, she cannot say, as it fell to ruin even before her time.": "如果问起，班瑞恩只知道这座钟楼曾经是一座古城的一部分。她把它的控制装置描述为 \"由宝石和银子组成的神奇机器\"，但由于担心它所散发的魔力而没有太过接近。至于谁建造了这座城市，她不能说，因为它甚至在她的时代之前就已经沦为废墟了。",
	"In D&D canon, Lum the Mad discovered an artifact of unknown origin (reimagined in this adventure as technology from a crashed planar craft) and used it to conquer large territories in Greyhawk's world of Oerth.": "在D&D典籍中，疯狂的卢姆发现了一件来历不明的艺术品（在这次冒险中被重新想象为来自坠毁的星球飞船的技术），并利用它征服了格雷霍克的奥尔斯世界中的大片领土。",
	"Opposing him was his former general, Leuk-O, who discovered a second artifact—a \"relic of a visiting race of space travelers.\" This magic suit of powered armor became known as the {@i Mighty Servant of Leuk-O}.": "反对他的是他的前将军，Leuk-O，他发现了第二件文物--\"一个来访的太空旅行者种族的遗迹\"。这套神奇的动力盔甲被称为{@i Mighty Servant of Leuk-O}。",
	"If Banrion is bridled, she must obey the characters as they deliver her to the dryad-hags. Assuming the characters don't uncover the hags' deception (or if they don't care), the unicorn's fate is a sad one, as the woods fall under the Three Mothers' corruption. ": "如果Banrion被束缚住了，她就必须服从人物的命令，把她交给干尸巫师。假设人物没有揭穿干尸的骗局（或者他们不在乎），独角兽的命运是悲惨的，因为森林陷入了三母的腐败。",
	"In this event, some time after the characters depart, they are visited by a knightly {@creature sprite} on a {@creature stirge} mount, who has hunted the party down to demand a duel by combat. He explains what the characters have really done, and offers to lead the characters back to the woods to right their wrongs if they can be persuaded to.": "在这个事件中，在人物离开一段时间后，一个骑着{@creature stirge}坐骑的骑士{@creature sprite}来拜访他们，他追捕他们，要求进行战斗决斗。他解释了这些人物的真实行为，并提出如果他们能被说服的话，可以带领这些人物回到森林中去纠正他们的错误。",
	"If the characters defeat the hags, Banrion returns to prominence and drives the rest of the wicked fey out of the woods. Before the characters depart, she asks them to once more use the panel at the clock tower bridge, adjusting time back toward the past. Combined with her own magical influence, this allows the unicorn to separate the myconids from the trees, returning the woods to their former condition.": "如果角色们打败了女巫，班瑞恩就会重出江湖，并将其他邪恶的精灵赶出森林。在人物离开之前，她要求他们再一次使用钟楼桥的面板，将时间调整到过去。再加上她自己的魔法影响，这使得独角兽能够将菌类从树木中分离出来，使森林恢复到以前的状态。",
	"With the hags defeated, Banrion has no further need for the clock tower panel's magical power. She insists that the characters take the two components, both as a reward and as items worthy of magical study. (She is also keen to ensure that the panel can never be used again to adjust time, in case doing so causes the hags or their corruption to return).": "随着女巫被打败，班瑞恩不再需要钟楼面板的魔力了。她坚持让这些人物拿走这两个部件，既作为奖励，也作为值得研究的魔法物品。(她也很想确保钟楼面板不能再被用来调整时间，以防止这样做会导致女巫或她们的堕落回来）。",
	"If the characters research the components or the ancient city, a successful DC 18 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill History}) check leads to the discovery that the city was the site from which Lum the Mad seized the great artifact that bears his name—and that the two components were once part of that artifact.": "如果角色研究这些部件或古城，成功通过DC18智力（{@skill Arcana}或{@skill History}）检查，就会发现这个城市是疯子卢姆夺取以他名字命名的伟大神器的地方，而这两个部件曾经是那个神器的一部分。",
	"After the characters return from the woods (or at any appropriate time depending on which adventure hooks you've used), the party is sought out by two competing agents. {@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR} and {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} are both searching for any missing components from the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}, and their spies have returned with news of the characters' knowledge or possession of the components from the clock tower. The agents look to meet with the characters, acquire the components they've found, and engage them to help find more.": "在人物从树林里回来后（或在任何适当的时候，取决于你所使用的冒险钩子），一行人被两个相互竞争的特工找出来。{@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR}和{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}都在寻找从{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}丢失的部件，他们的间谍带着人物知道或拥有钟楼上的部件的消息回来。探员们希望与这些人物会面，获得他们找到的部件，并让他们帮助寻找更多的部件。",
	"Two archdevils—Zariel and Bel—have longed battled for control over Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. To advance their cause, both archdevils plan to rebuild the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}, then incorporate that artifact into a powerful infernal war machine. To this end, both devils have placed competing agents into the world, tasking them with collecting as many of the missing components of the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad} as possible.": "两个大恶魔--扎里尔和贝尔--长期以来一直在为控制九层地狱的第一层阿弗纳斯而争斗。为了推进他们的事业，两个大恶魔都计划重建{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}，然后将该神器纳入一个强大的地狱战争机器。为此，两个魔鬼都在世界范围内安插了相互竞争的特工，让他们尽可能多地收集{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}的缺失部件。",

	"Through their own research of legends, ancient texts, journals, and the like (as well as spying on one another), both agents have located additional missing components. However, recent expeditions to the locations described in these texts has proven fruitless, with the missing components revealed as lost, destroyed, or locked away beyond mortal reach. Each agent now desires to launch a new expedition to these locations—but to a different time in the past when the missing components might still be recoverable.": "通过他们自己对传说、古籍、期刊等的研究（以及互相刺探），两名特工都找到了更多失踪的部件。然而，最近对这些文本中描述的地点进行的探险被证明是没有结果的，失踪的部件被发现是丢失的、被破坏的，或者被锁在凡人无法到达的地方。每位特工现在都希望对这些地点进行新的考察--但要到过去的不同时期，那时失踪的部件可能还能恢复。",

Chief among those causes is the defeat of the servants of the archdevil Bel. An eccentric dilettante, Lynx has had her thick horns intricately carved and inlaid with sigils and figures in silver, including multiple images of her namesake lynx. She has also lost one eye from old adventuring misfortunes, replacing it with a glass eye of hazy crystal. Several of her teeth have also been replaced with precious stones and metals.": "她以一个盗贼流氓的身份出现，{@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR}谈到她是如何作为一个冒险家退休的，以利用她收集的财富和收集的古物为更高尚的事业服务。这些事业中最主要的是打败大恶魔贝尔的仆人。猞猁是个古怪的二流子，她的厚厚的角上精雕细琢，镶嵌着银色的符号和数字，包括她同名的猞猁的多个图像。她的一只眼睛也因为以前的冒险不幸而失去了，取而代之的是一只朦胧的水晶玻璃眼。她的几颗牙齿也被换成了珍贵的宝石和金属。",
	"In truth, Lynx is an active agent of Zariel but is no longer among the living. Rather, she's a lawful evil undead tiefling, with her skeleton specially crafted to retain her former skills and intellect, and bonded to an equally special flesh golem that she wears as a costumed skin. (If you are playing through {@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA}, this setup was one of Mad Maggie's creations while the hag was in Zariel's employ.) Beneath this golem costume, Lynx's bones are carved and silver-scribed in the same manner as her horns. She uses her skull, which is locked and accessed from inside the back of her mouth, as a container for her most private treasures.": "事实上，林克斯是扎里尔的一个活跃的特工，但却不再是活人了。相反，她是一个合法的邪恶的不死铁弗林，她的骨架是专门制作的，以保留她以前的技能和智力，并与一个同样特殊的肉体格姆结合在一起，她把它当作服装的皮肤。(如果你在玩穿越{@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA}，这个设置是疯狂的麦琪在受雇于扎里尔时的创作之一。) 在这套魔像服装下，猞猁的骨头被雕刻成与她的角一样的银色。她用她的头骨作为她最私人的宝物的容器，而她的头骨是锁着的，可以从她嘴的后面进入。",
	"If the characters accept Lynx's invitation, she meets them while strolling the long hallways of her manor, the walls of which are filled with fine paintings. Rather than noting their artists or subjects, however, Lynx describes each painting based on where she stole it from.": "如果人物接受了林克斯的邀请，她就会在她的庄园的长长的走廊上与他们见面，墙上挂满了精美的绘画。然而，林克斯并没有注意到他们的艺术家或主题，而是根据她从哪里偷来的画来描述每一幅画。",
	"As she talks with the characters, Lynx relates that several of the missing components are mentioned in various legends surrounding the Tomb of Horrors, but recent expeditions sent to the tomb have all failed to return. Lynx believes that an expedition should instead be sent to an earlier time in the tomb's construction, when the missing components are known to be there. She further theorizes that existing components of the {@i Infernal Machine} (either those the characters have brought to her, or those already in her possession) could allow time to be manipulated in some localized fashion within the tomb.": "当她与这些人物交谈时，林克斯说，在围绕恐怖之墓的各种传说中提到了几个失踪的部件，但最近派往该墓的探险队都没有回来。猞猁认为，应该把探险队派到古墓建造的较早时期，那时已知失踪的部件就在那里。她进一步推测，现有的{@i Infernal Machine}组件（要么是那些人物带给她的，要么是那些已经在她手中的）可以让时间在古墓中以某种局部的方式被操纵。",

Ursas proudly claims to be the very figure depicted in {@i A Paladin in Hell}—a painting that has become famous throughout Faerûn—and that he lost his arm on that expedition, fighting the forces of the archdevil Zariel.": "战士{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}的形象很有气势--一个巨大的、肌肉发达的战士，他的一只胳膊在肘部被嫁接了一只灰熊的爪子。他的黑发长而蓬松，眼睛充血，肤色始终红润，似乎是由于运动、劳累和对下属的吼叫而造成的。Ursas骄傲地说他就是{@i A Paladin in Hell}中描绘的人物--一幅在整个Faerûn都很有名的画，他在那次远征中失去了手臂，与大恶魔Zariel的部队作战。",
	"However, {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} is hardly the honorable knight he presents himself as. He is secretly a warrior in the service of Bel, and has sworn vengeance against all those who would oppose Bel and the archdevil's struggle to reclaim Avernus—especially followers of Zariel.": "然而，{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}并不是他所表现出来的光荣的骑士。他暗地里是一个为贝尔服务的战士，并发誓要对所有反对贝尔和大恶魔夺回阿弗纳斯的斗争的人进行报复，特别是扎里尔的追随者。",

Its grounds are surrounded by a vast and intricate hedge maze under a permanent {@spell guards and wards} spell. Any creature navigating the maze on their own without guidance must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become disoriented and lost. Such creatures are unable to find their way to the manor, as all paths appear to only exit the maze.": "{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}居住在一个名副其实的据点，位于城市范围之外。它的地面被一个巨大而复杂的篱笆迷宫所包围，并受到永久（1%）的咒语。任何生物在没有指引的情况下独自在迷宫中航行，必须在DC18智慧救赎中成功，否则就会迷失方向并迷失方向。这样的生物无法找到他们去庄园的路，因为所有的路似乎都只能从迷宫里出来。",

	"Ursas states that he seeks the missing components in order to complete his version of the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}. When complete, the powerful artifact will allow him to finish the military campaign he started long ago, letting him return to Avernus and take on the forces of Zariel. Further, he is open about his rivalry with Lynx. He claims that the retired rogue is after the missing components only to add them to her collection of stolen rarities, and that she has no intention of putting them into the service of good.": "Ursas说他在寻找缺失的部件，以便完成他的{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}的版本。完成后，这个强大的神器将使他能够完成他很久以前开始的军事行动，让他回到阿弗纳斯并对付扎里尔的部队。此外，他还公开了他与林克斯的竞争关系。他声称，这个退役的流氓追寻失踪的部件只是为了将它们加入她偷来的稀有物品的收藏中，而她并不打算将它们用于正义的事业。",
	"As he talks with the characters, {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} relates that several of the missing components are mentioned in legends surrounding an ancient Temple of Moloch. Recent expeditions there have found the temple ruined and looted, and the missing components are long gone. Ursas believes that an expedition should instead be sent to an earlier time in the temple's history, when the missing components are known to be there. He further theorizes that existing components of the {@i Infernal Machine} (either those the characters have brought to him, or those already in his possession) could allow time to be manipulated in some localized fashion within the temple.": "当他与这些人物交谈时，{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}说，在围绕一个古老的摩洛神庙的传说中提到了几个失踪的部件。最近的探险队在那里发现神庙被毁坏并被洗劫一空，而失踪的部件也早已不复存在。Ursas认为，应该将探险队派往该神庙历史上较早的时期，那时已知失踪的部件就在那里。他进一步推测，现有的(1%)组件（要么是人物带给他的，要么是他已经拥有的）可以让时间在神庙内以某种局部的方式被操纵。",

If the characters possess any missing components, he asks to buy those so that they can be added to the construct as well.": "{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}为角色们提供了一个神奇的构造物的服务，这个构造物与{@i Mighty Servant of Leuk-O}的缩小版相似，并被昵称为卢克。该建筑由Ursas收集的{@i Infernal Machine}组件之一提供动力。如果人物拥有任何缺失的部件，他要求购买这些部件，以便将它们也添加到该建筑中。",

	"The characters can ally themselves with either agent, whether choosing to deal with the first agent they meet, or meeting both before making a choice. They might even meet with both in order to play one against the other. They might distrust both agents and ally with neither, instead undertaking the adventure on their own to capture the missing components and prevent them falling into the wrong hands. In the latter case, you simply need to arrange for them to gain access to their own mechanical guide, whether through theft, purchase, or an alternative patron (such as Kwalish).": "人物可以与任何一个特工结盟，无论是选择与他们遇到的第一个特工打交道，还是在做出选择之前与两个特工见面。他们甚至可以同时与两个人见面，以便让一个人对抗另一个人。他们可能不信任这两个特工，不与任何一个结盟，而是自己进行冒险，捕捉失踪的部件，防止它们落入坏人手中。在后一种情况下，你只需要安排他们获得自己的机械指南，无论是通过偷窃、购买，还是通过其他赞助人（如Kwalish）。",
	"Depending on which agent they ally themselves with, the characters will initially travel to either the Tomb of Horrors or the Temple of Moloch. If you want to focus on only one location in the adventure, that's fine. But plot hooks and NPC interactions at each location give you lots of opportunity to inspire or compel the characters to travel to the second location, either after or in conjunction with exploring the first location.": "根据他们与哪个特工结盟，人物最初将前往恐怖之墓或摩洛神庙。如果你想在冒险中只关注一个地点，那也可以。但每个地点的情节钩子和NPC互动给了你很多机会来激发或迫使角色去第二个地点，无论是在探索第一个地点之后还是在探索第一个地点的过程中。",
	"Each guide is an unaligned Medium construct with AC 20, 50 hit points, and a speed of 20 feet. It has no attacks, and has a +0 modifier for all its ability scores.": "每个向导都是一个不结盟的中型结构体，AC为20，50点命中率，速度为20英尺。它没有攻击力，所有的能力值都是+0的修正值。",
	"Each guide has 6 charges, and regains {@dice 1d6} expended charges daily at dawn. Teleporting itself and the party to either adventure locale or back to its home manor costs a guide 1 charge. A guide can also be commanded to spend 1 or more charges to manipulate time in the local area at either adventure location. See \"{@area Manipulating Time|049|x}\" below for more information.": "每个向导有6个电荷，并且每天在黎明时分重新获得{@dice 1d6}已消耗的电荷。将自己和队伍传送到任何一个冒险地点或回到自己的庄园，都要花费向导1个电荷。导游也可以被命令花费1个或更多的费用来操纵任何一个冒险地点的当地时间。更多信息见下面的\"{@area Manipulating Time|049|x}\"。",
	"All damage dealt to a guide can be restored during a long rest with a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools or tinker's tools. A damaged guide can also be restored to full hit points by the use of a {@spell mending} spell or similar magic. If reduced to 0 hit points, the guide is destroyed and no longer functions—possibly stranding the characters in the distant past. {@adventure Chapter 3|IMR|3} and {@adventure chapter 4|IMR|4} each offer appropriate suggestions for how the characters might repair or replace a destroyed guide.": "导游受到的所有伤害可以在长时间的休息中通过使用盗贼的工具或工匠的工具进行成功的DC14灵巧检查来恢复。受损的向导也可以通过使用{@spell mending}的咒语或类似的魔法恢复到全部命中率。如果降低到0命中率，指南就会被摧毁，不再起作用--可能会把人物困在遥远的过去。{@adventure Chapter 3|IMR|3}和{@adventure chapter 4|IMR|4}分别对人物如何修复或替换被破坏的指南提供了适当的建议。",

	"If the characters meet with both agents, they might agree to work for both without the other agent knowing. In that case, it's possible that they acquire both mechanical guides. You can decide whether the programming of the two constructs causes them to bicker and one-up each other—or whether each guide attempts to sabotage and destroy its counterpart. Or you might decide that they develop a mutual respect for each other, perhaps even becoming friends as a result of their shared adventures. If on friendly terms, a guide can restore any damage dealt to its counterpart during a short rest, by willingly sacrificing parts for the other.": "如果人物与这两个特工见面，他们可能会同意为这两个特工工作而不被另一个特工知道。在这种情况下，他们有可能获得两个机械向导。你可以决定这两个构造物的程序是否会导致他们争吵和互相指责，或者每个引导者是否试图破坏和摧毁其对应物。或者，你可以决定他们发展出相互尊重的关系，甚至可能因为他们共同的冒险而成为朋友。如果是友好关系，向导可以在短暂的休息中恢复对其同伴造成的任何伤害，愿意为对方牺牲一部分。",
	"The ability to manipulate time at either the Tomb of Horrors or the Temple of Moloch is a fun part of the adventure, so make sure the players are clear on the parameters for doing so. The following information reflects what the characters learn from the mechanical guide they work with:": "在恐怖之墓或摩洛神庙操纵时间的能力是冒险的一个有趣部分，所以要确保玩家清楚地了解这样做的参数。下面的信息反映了人物从他们工作的机械指南中了解到的情况。",
	"The {@i Infernal Machine} components placed into the mechanical guides allow the characters to order a guide to spend 1 or more charges to alter time within individual areas of the Tomb of Horrors and the Temple of Moloch. If the localized time in an area at either site can be altered, that area's description has a \"Manipulating Time\" section, detailing the effects that result when a mechanical guide spends charges to alter the flow of time in that area.": "放在机械导引器中的{@i Infernal Machine}组件允许角色命令导引器花费1个或更多的费用来改变恐怖之墓和摩洛神庙的个别区域的时间。如果这两个地方的某个区域的局部时间可以被改变，那么该区域的描述中有一个 \"操纵时间 \"的部分，详细说明了当机械向导花钱改变该区域的时间流时产生的效果。",
	"A guide spends 1 or more charges using its action. Commanding a guide to spend a charge requires no action.": "一个向导使用其行动来花费1个或多个冲锋。指挥一个向导花费一个冲锋，不需要任何行动。",
	"Neither the characters nor the agents know in advance which rooms are subject to localized time effects, which areas can be affected by multiple charges, whether spending charges advances or rewinds time, or if the effects will be helpful, harmful, or simply wondrous in nature. Ultimately, some amount of experimentation might be necessary.": "角色和代理人都不知道哪些房间会受到局部时间效应的影响，哪些区域会受到多次收费的影响，花钱是为了让时间前进还是倒退，或者这些效应是有益的、有害的，还是仅仅是奇妙的性质。最终，某种程度的实验可能是必要的。",
	"By spending 1 or more charges in an area, a mechanical guide alters the flow of time within that area in a limited way. As time flows forward or backward, the characters see the area and its occupants move like ghosts into the future or the past, then settle back into the normal time frame once more. As was seen at the clock tower in chapter 1, this time manipulation affects only the immediate area and that area's original inhabitants. The characters, any creatures accompanying them, and any creatures that enter the area while time is shifting are not affected.": "通过在一个区域花费1个或更多的费用，一个机械向导以有限的方式改变了该区域的时间流。当时间向前或向后流动时，人物会看到这个区域和它的居民像幽灵一样移动到未来或过去，然后再一次回到正常的时间框架中。正如第一章中在钟楼看到的那样，这种时间操纵只影响到附近的区域和该区域的原始居民。人物、陪伴他们的任何生物，以及在时间转移时进入该区域的任何生物都不受影响。",
	"For example, having a mechanical guide spend 1 or more charges in a specific room might cause that room's occupants to move to a different location, as local time speeds forward or back to a point when those occupants are going on or off duty, starting or ending a rest period, and so on. The characters and other outside observers see the affected occupants retreating or advancing in time, but cannot interact with them.": "例如，让一个机械向导在一个特定的房间里花费1个或更多的电荷，可能会导致这个房间里的人移动到不同的位置，因为当地的时间加速前进或后退到一个点，当这些人要上岗或下班，开始或结束一个休息时间，等等。人物和其他外部观察者会看到受影响的住户在时间上撤退或前进，但不能与他们互动。",
	"Once the affected creatures arrive at their new time and location, they start acting as they normally would from that point forward. This means that creatures going back in time have their memories revert, such that they forget any interactions with characters in the area they just left. Likewise, time-manipulated creatures will suddenly \"discover\" characters if they encounter them in the area where they return to normal time.": "一旦受影响的生物到达他们的新时间和新地点，他们就会从那一刻开始像平常一样行动。这意味着回到过去的生物的记忆会恢复，这样他们就会忘记与他们刚刚离开的区域内的人物的任何互动。同样地，被时间操纵的生物如果在他们回到正常时间的区域遇到人物，就会突然 \"发现 \"他们。",
	"By manipulating time in either adventure locale, NPCs and monsters can be moved into new positions so that combat can be avoided (even if that combat is already underway). Likewise, characters who fail badly in negotiations with NPCs can try to wind back the clock to replay those negotiations as desired.": "通过操纵冒险地点的时间，NPC和怪物可以被移到新的位置，这样就可以避免战斗（即使战斗已经开始了）。同样，在与NPC的谈判中严重失败的角色可以尝试让时间倒流，以重新进行所需的谈判。",
	"The Tomb of Horrors is one of the most legendary dungeons in the multiverse. Shaped by the demilich Acererak as a testing ground for would-be heroes—and as a place to steal the souls of those heroes whose skills where found wanting—the tomb has claimed countless lives over millennia, and even some of the most hardened adventurers would think twice about entering those deadly halls. But by going back into the past, the characters have a chance to explore a version of the Tomb of Horrors that few have ever seen, and to engage one of the world's deadliest dungeons on their own terms.": "恐怖之墓是多元宇宙中最具传奇色彩的地牢之一。恐怖之墓是由半人半兽的阿克雷拉克（Acererak）塑造的，作为未来英雄的试验场，并作为窃取那些技能不足的英雄的灵魂的地方，千百年来夺去了无数人的生命，即使是一些最强硬的冒险家也会对进入这些致命的大厅三思而行。但是，通过回到过去，角色们有机会探索一个很少有人见过的恐怖之墓的版本，并以自己的方式参与世界上最致命的地牢之一。",
	"According to legend, Acererak was a tiefling fathered by a balor named {@creature Tarnhem|IMR}. In his youth, he studied spellcasting under Vecna, and has since become an archmage of surpassing evil. While researching the means to achieve lichdom, Acererak built a number of dungeons and tombs, including his famed Tomb of Horrors. Those dungeons were created partly as a means to draw out and defeat those adventurers driven to seek and destroy him—and partly to claim those adventurers' souls to feed his phylactery.": "根据传说，Acererak是一个名叫{@creature Tarnhem|IMR}的巴洛尔人所生的铁皮人。年轻时，他在韦克纳手下学习法术，此后成为一名超越邪恶的大法师。在研究实现巫术的方法时，阿塞拉克建造了许多地牢和坟墓，包括他著名的恐怖之墓。建造这些地牢的目的，一方面是为了引出并击败那些被驱使寻找并摧毁他的冒险者，另一方面是为了夺取这些冒险者的灵魂来喂养他的法器。",
	"Even after Acererak eventually became an archlich whose dark plots would threaten the world, he left behind the Tomb of Horrors as a monument to his greatness. But in its earliest stages, the tomb was a very different sort of place.": "即使在阿克雷拉克最终成为大法官，其黑暗的阴谋将威胁到世界之后，他仍然留下了恐怖之墓作为他伟大的纪念碑。但在其最初阶段，该墓是一个非常不同的地方。",
	"Over the years of the tomb's construction, {@creature Moghadam|IMR} and his rival artificer, {@creature Thessalar|IMR}, have competed fiercely against each other's endeavors. {@creature Moghadam|IMR} takes pleasure in having lured away several sculptors from {@creature Thessalar|IMR}'s temple to help with the tomb's construction. He has also recently sent a party of thieves and a master gemsmith to his rival's temple, instructing them to steal the temple's two most famous gems—set into the eyes of a great statue of Moloch—for use in the creation of Acererak's jeweled demilich skull. Unfortunately, those thieves have failed to return, and are presumed captured by {@creature Thessalar|IMR}.": "在建造坟墓的这些年里，{@creature Moghadam|IMR}和他的对手工匠，{@creature Thessalar|IMR}，对对方的努力进行了激烈的竞争。{@creature Moghadam|IMR}很高兴从{@creature Thessalar|IMR}的寺庙里引诱了几个雕塑家来帮助建造坟墓。他最近还派了一队盗贼和一位宝石大师去他的对手的神庙，指示他们偷取神庙里最有名的两颗宝石--镶嵌在摩洛神的大雕像的眼睛里--用于制造阿克拉克的宝石半身人头骨。不幸的是，这些小偷没有回来，估计是被{@creature Thessalar|IMR}抓住了。",
	"This version of the Tomb of Horrors takes place in the distant past, when various legendary figures of in-game history (Acererak included) still operate as mere mortals. Several of such figures have been included as NPCs, but you should not treat this adventure's approach to those characters as canon. Rather, use them to flesh out this particular adventure in \"what-if\" fashion. Alternatively, if you prefer not to populate the adventure with such prominent names, you can substitute those characters with unnamed general NPCs who can fill the same roles.": "这个版本的恐怖之墓发生在遥远的过去，当时游戏历史上的各种传奇人物（包括Acererak）仍然作为凡人活动。有几个这样的人物被列为NPC，但你不应该把这次冒险对这些人物的处理方式当作正统。相反，用他们来充实这个特定的冒险，以 \"假设 \"的方式。另外，如果你不愿意用这些著名的名字来充实这个冒险，你可以用没有名字的一般NPC来代替这些人物，他们可以担任同样的角色。",

In recent years, he has also researched the prolonging of life—namely his own. {@creature Thessalar|IMR} hopes that by becoming a lich, his research and experiments can continue indefinitely.": "作为一个工匠，{@creature Thessalar|IMR}是虚荣的、自负的，而且在推进他的研究方面是完全无情的。他的职业生涯开始于为摩洛神服务的牧师，在那里他不断晋升，最终接管了神庙作为一个工作实验室。他的大部分实验都涉及到对新的生命形式的追求，产生了诸如thessalhydra和猫头鹰熊等生物。近年来，他还研究了延长生命的问题，尤其是他自己的生命。{@creature Thessalar|IMR}希望通过成为一个巫师，他的研究和实验可以无限期地继续下去。",
	"Over time, {@creature Thessalar|IMR} has subjected himself to so many of his own experiments that his blood has taken on alchemical and magical properties. He regularly uses it as the basis for many of the reagents used throughout his labs. As a side effect, although {@creature Thessalar|IMR} is now immune to poison and the {@condition poisoned} condition, any magical liquid or salve that restores hit points acts as a poison against him if applied to a piercing or slashing weapon.": "随着时间的推移，{@creature Thessalar|IMR}让自己接受了许多自己的实验，他的血液已经有了炼金术和魔法的特性。他经常用它作为他整个实验室中使用的许多试剂的基础。作为一个副作用，虽然{@creature Thessalar|IMR}现在对毒药和{@condition poisoned}状况免疫，但任何恢复命中率的魔法液体或药膏，如果用在穿刺或切割的武器上，都会对他产生毒害。",

	"If the characters' mechanical guide is lost or destroyed while they explore the Temple of Moloch, you can make use of a number of options to keep the characters from remaining stranded in the past. {@creature Thessalar|IMR} can repair or rebuild the guide for a suitable price, as can {@creature Moghadam|IMR} if an overland trek is made to reach him. (The sculptors in the temple possess maps showing the way to the Tomb of Horrors.) Alternatively, replacement parts for the guide might be recovered from the bottom of the underground lake at the end of the adventure—if the characters are able to deal with the thessalkraken!": "如果人物在探索摩洛神庙时，他们的机械向导丢失或被毁，你可以利用一些选项来使人物不至于一直被困在过去。{@creature Thessalar|IMR}可以以合适的价格修理或重建向导，如果从陆路跋涉到他那里，也可以{@creature Moghadam|IMR}。(寺庙里的雕塑家拥有显示通往恐怖之墓的地图）。另外，在冒险结束时，可以从地下湖底找到向导的替换零件--如果角色们能够对付萨克拉肯的话！）。",

	"During the fight, both agents shout out accusations that reveal the other's true natures. Those natures are then confirmed by the agents themselves.

If this happens, a guide's time traveling ability can be curtailed as you desire.": "机械导引器被设定为服务于它们的代理人主人--在其他人试图控制它们的情况下会自我毁灭。尽管如此，接触到{@i Infernal Machine}组件的力量可能会改变向导的程序，允许人物与它交好并永久地将其作为伙伴或盟友。如果发生这种情况，向导的时间旅行能力可以按照你的意愿被削减。",
	"Because this adventure traverses both time and space, you might decide that actions carried out by the characters in the past of chapters 3 and 4 create changes in the present of the campaign world when they return. For example, the construction of the Tomb of Horrors might be disrupted, in which case it holds less prominence in later times. If {@creature Thessalar|IMR} regains his missing sculptors, he might complete his stone golem and send it out to destroy {@creature Moghadam|IMR} and demolish the tomb while it's under construction. {@creature Thessalar|IMR} might also create more monsters than he is already known for, which can spread throughout the world.": "因为这次冒险穿越了时间和空间，所以你可以决定让角色在第三章和第四章的过去进行的行动在他们回来时对现在的活动世界产生变化。例如，恐怖之墓的建造可能会被破坏，在这种情况下，它在后来的时代中的地位就不那么突出了。如果{@creature Thessalar|IMR}重新找回了他失踪的雕塑家，他可能会完成他的石雕，并派它去摧毁{@creature Moghadam|IMR}，并在坟墓建设中拆除它。{@creature Thessalar|IMR}也可能创造出比他已经出名的更多的怪物，这些怪物可以在全世界传播。",

	"If having three dryads working together is too immediate a tipoff that these might be hags forming a coven, you can add a fourth illusory mother to the mix to help allay suspicion.

If the characters attempt to speak with her, the programmed illusion is able to mumble a few incoherent words. A successful DC 16 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check detects this illusion.": "如果三个干尸在一起工作太过直接，让人觉得他们可能是女巫组成的女巫团，你可以在其中加入第四个虚幻的母亲，以帮助消除怀疑。用几根木头和树枝做成的刺猬妈妈，静静地坐在小屋的角落里。如果角色试图和她说话，这个程序化的幻象能够喃喃自语，说一些语无伦次的话。成功通过DC16智力({@skill Investigation})检查可以发现这个幻象。",
	"The hags' cottage is built from three trees entwined together. These trees might contain the three true dryads whose appearances the hags have stolen for their own use, and who have been enslaved by the hags to help with their corrupt gardening.

": "女巫的小屋是由三棵树缠绕在一起建成的。这些树可能包含了三个真正的干尸，她们的外表被女巫们窃取为己用，并被女巫们奴役，帮助她们进行腐败的园艺工作。如果人物与Banrion交谈，独角兽会要求他们帮助释放干尸，使森林恢复秩序。",
	"Instead of the hags being disguised as goodly dryads, you might instead choose to reverse the scenario. The Three Mothers might really be dryads in need of help, with Banrion the unicorn an evil creature that must be defeated to save the woods. The unicorn might even be using its dark magic to cause the dryads to appear as hags.": "与其把女巫伪装成善良的干尸，你可能会选择颠覆这个场景。三位母亲可能真的是需要帮助的干尸，而独角兽Banrion是邪恶的生物，必须被打败才能拯救森林。独角兽甚至可能使用它的黑暗魔法，使干尸们变成了巫婆。",
	"If the characters initially make an aggressive approach toward Banrion (whether because the hags have fooled them or because the unicorn is evil), you can make the fight tougher by having the unicorn appear while the characters are attempting to cross the clock tower bridge. While fighting on the bridge, Banrion looks to knock characters off the tower into the chasm below, or even to try to collapse the tower under the characters while she teleports away.": "如果角色最初对班瑞恩采取了积极的态度（无论是因为女巫欺骗了他们还是因为独角兽是邪恶的），你可以让独角兽在角色试图穿过钟楼桥时出现，从而使战斗更加艰难。在桥上战斗时，班瑞恩会把角色从塔上打到下面的鸿沟里，甚至在她传送走的时候试图把塔压在角色下面。",

Each expedition also has its own mechanical guide. You might use the members of the rival expedition to chase after the characters, or they might have already arrived at one of the locations and be set up for the characters to stumble upon. The members of the alternative expedition might set obstacles along the way, possibly inspiring the characters to do the same. Using the power of a mechanical guide might allow for the creation of particularly devious traps that can be set across space and time. And the members of the alternative expedition certainly look to sabotage or destroy the characters' mechanical guide in order to strand them.": "这些远征队由五个{@creature cultist}仆人组成，由{@creature enhanced medusa|IMR}的猞猁带领，或由{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}的铁脑袋带领（关于两者的更多信息见下文）。每个探险队也有自己的机械向导。你可以用对手的探险队成员来追赶角色，或者他们可能已经到达某个地点，并被安排好让角色偶然遇到。另一支探险队的成员可能会在路上设置障碍，可能会激励角色做同样的事。利用机械向导的力量，可以创造出特别狡猾的陷阱，可以跨越空间和时间来设置。而另类探险队的成员当然会破坏或摧毁人物的机械向导，以便将他们困住。",

The medusa is nicknamed \"Daoud's Living Lanthorn\" as a result.": "和{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}的增强型狮身人面像一样，这个生物也被增强了来自壁垒峰的各种技术。具体来说，它的眼睛被替换成了机械框架，里面可以插入不同的镜片。这也是用来创造另一件神器（1%）的神奇技术。因此，这只美杜莎被昵称为 \"达乌德的活兰瑟\"。",
	"The {@creature enhanced medusa|IMR} uses the {@creature medusa} stat block with the following changes:": "{@creature enhanced medusa|IMR}使用{@creature medusa}的统计块，并做了以下改动。",
	"It can cast the {@spell light} cantrip at will.": "它可以随意施放{@spell light}的咒语。",
	"Its Petrifying Gaze trait turns creatures into metal, wood, or porcelain (the medusa's choice) rather than stone.": "它的石化凝视特性可以将生物变成金属、木头或瓷器（由美杜莎选择）而不是石头。",
	"If this adventure is played as a sequel to {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}, the {@creature enhanced medusa|IMR} might seek revenge for what befell its ancestor {@creature Gloine Nathair-Nathair|IMR}, or could be appeased with information regarding that medusa's whereabouts.": "如果这次冒险是作为{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}的续集，{@creature enhanced medusa|IMR}可能会为它的祖先{@creature Gloine Nathair-Nathair|IMR}的遭遇寻求报复，或者用关于那个美杜莎的下落的信息来安抚它。",
	"This creature originated from old designs of Kwalish, and takes the form of multiple brains that have been magically preserved and which collectively operate a new mechanical body. The brains share insights and knowledge with one another, and have typically been taken from creatures that desired to prolong their consciousness—or that were tasked with controlling a construct for all time as punishment.": "这种生物起源于Kwalish的古老设计，以多个大脑的形式出现，这些大脑被神奇地保存下来，共同操作一个新的机械身体。这些大脑彼此分享见解和知识，通常是从那些希望延长自己意识的生物身上取下来的，或者是那些作为惩罚而被要求永远控制一个构造物的生物。",
	"A {@creature brain in iron|IMR} uses the {@creature brain in a jar|LLK} stat block with the following changes:": "A{@creature brain in iron|IMR}使用{@creature brain in a jar|LLK}的状态块，并做了以下修改。",

	"It has a speed of 20 feet.": "它的速度为20英尺。",
	"If this adventure is played as a sequel to {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}, this creature began as the brains in jars encountered in the Barrier Peaks. After constructing a new collective body from spare parts, the brains escaped (and now seek revenge against the characters if they did not aid the brains sufficiently during that adventure). The brains' collective goal in seeking the missing components is to be able to transfer themselves into the ultimate mechanical body—the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}.": "如果这次冒险是作为{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}的续集来玩的，这种生物开始是在屏障峰遇到的罐子里的大脑。在用零件构建了一个新的集体身体后，这些大脑逃了出来（如果在那次冒险中没有充分帮助这些大脑，他们现在会对这些人物进行报复）。大脑的集体目标是寻找缺失的部件，以便能够将自己转移到最终的机械身体--{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}。",
	"You can expand the characters' exploration of the Tomb of Horrors construction site in a number of ways.": "你可以通过多种方式扩展人物对恐怖之墓建筑工地的探索。",
	"Even villains have their hobbies—and for {@creature Moghadam|IMR}, that hobby is death traps. Any character who discusses traps with {@creature Moghadam|IMR} can impart to him a new deadly design—either using suitable roleplaying and player ingenuity, or a successful DC 16 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. Doing so gains {@creature Moghadam|IMR}'s favor and advantage on further ability checks made to negotiate with the artificer, as you determine.": "即使是恶棍也有他们的爱好--对{@creature Moghadam|IMR}来说，这个爱好就是死亡陷阱。任何与{@creature Moghadam|IMR}讨论过陷阱的角色都可以向他传授新的致命设计--要么使用合适的角色扮演和玩家的聪明才智，要么成功进行DC16魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查。这样做可以获得{@creature Moghadam|IMR}的好感，并在与工匠谈判的进一步能力检定中获得优势，具体由你决定。",
	"As an added element of danger and dilemma during the ceremony in the chapel ({@area area 14|093|x}), each time a character succeeds on a saving throw to resist the ceremony's power, one of the worshipers in the pews is overcome and transforms into black rock.": "在礼拜堂的仪式中，作为一个额外的危险和困境的元素（{@area area 14|093|x}），每当一个角色在抵抗仪式的力量时蓄力成功，就会有一个在座位上的崇拜者被征服并变成黑岩。",
	"If the black rocks from the chapel are brought to the sculptors, you might decide that they can help restore those victims to life using their superior mason's tools. Alternatively, the sculptors might want to incorporate these magic rocks into an even more impressive golem, helping to ensure their escape. Likewise, if taken to the Temple of Moloch, these rocks might be highly prized for the crafting of statues and homunculi.": "如果把小教堂里的黑色石头带给雕塑家，你可能会决定他们可以用他们优越的石匠工具帮助那些受害者恢复生命。另外，雕塑家们可能会想把这些神奇的石头融入到一个更令人印象深刻的巨石中，帮助确保他们逃脱。同样地，如果被带到摩洛神庙，这些石头可能会被高度重视，用于制作雕像和同形体。",

	"{@creature Thessalar|IMR}'s fixation on monster design provides an opportunity for bonding with any character with insight into that topic—or who can fake it well enough, either using suitable roleplaying and player ingenuity, or a successful DC 16 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. Suggesting a new design for a magical creature (ideally one combining the aspects of two or more existing creatures in some particularly deadly way) can grant advantage on checks made to interact with the artificer.": "{@creature Thessalar|IMR}对怪物设计的痴迷提供了一个与任何对该主题有洞察力的角色建立联系的机会--或者说谁能很好地伪造它，要么使用合适的角色扮演和玩家的智慧，要么成功地进行DC 16魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查。建议一个新的魔法生物的设计（最好是以某种特别致命的方式结合两个或更多现有生物的方面）可以在与工匠互动的检查中获得优势。",
	"If the characters pass through the village mentioned in the \"{@area Temple Approach|0c1|x}\" section, they might discover that one of the villagers is one of Mack Francache's thieves, left behind to keep an eye on activities outside the temple. When the characters arrive, this thief presents themself as a seemingly reluctant guide willing to join the characters on the incursion into the temple. While there, they secretly try to direct the characters toward rescuing the imprisoned thieves.": "如果人物经过\"{@area Temple Approach|0c1|x} \"部分提到的村庄，他们可能会发现其中一个村民是Mack Francache的一个盗贼，被留下来监视神庙外的活动。当人物到达时，这个盗贼以一个看似不情愿的向导身份出现，愿意和人物一起进入神庙。在那里，他们秘密地试图引导人物去解救被囚禁的盗贼。",
	"Mack Francache the wererat prisoner ({@area area 9|0eb|x}) might instead be a lycanthrope of some kind never seen before: a weremouse, a weremoose, or even a wereooze. {@creature Thessalar|IMR} is extremely interested in studying this new lycanthropy. Alternatively, Mack might have been a normal human when he came to the temple, only to have {@creature Thessalar|IMR} impose this strange lycanthropy upon him.": "狼人囚犯Mack Francache({@area area 9|0eb|x})可能是某种从未见过的狼人：狼鼠、狼驼，甚至是狼犬。{@creature Thessalar|IMR}对研究这种新的狼化现象非常感兴趣。另外，麦克来到神庙时可能是一个正常的人类，只是被{@creature Thessalar|IMR}强加给他这种奇怪的狼人。",
	"You might introduce different options for interacting with the statues in {@area area 24|136|x}, especially if combat breaks out there. For example, if the eidolon inhabits a statue of Zariel or Bel, the characters might gain advantage on attack rolls against that statue if they serve the archdevil's agent (or disadvantage on attack rolls against the statue of the competing agent's patron). Out of combat, if the characters are allied with {@creature Moghadam|IMR} and remove a hand and an eye from any statue, Vecna rewards them with some boon (advantage on attack rolls during the first round of their next fight, having a consumable magic item appear in the statue's remaining hand, and so forth).": "你可以引入不同的选项来与{@area area 24|136|x}的雕像互动，尤其是在那里发生战斗的时候。例如，如果Eidolon居住在Zariel或Bel的雕像中，如果角色为大恶魔的代理人服务，他们可能会在对该雕像的攻击卷中获得优势（或在对竞争代理人的守护者的雕像的攻击卷中处于劣势）。在战斗之外，如果人物与{@creature Moghadam|IMR}结盟，并从任何雕像上取下一只手和一只眼睛，Vecna就会奖励他们一些好处（在下一次战斗的第一轮中获得攻击卷的优势，在雕像剩下的手上出现一个可消耗的魔法物品，等等）。",
	"One of the chickens in {@area area 35|15f|x} might be one of {@creature Thessalar|IMR}'s experiments, such that it occasionally lays silver eggs (worth 10 gp) or even golden eggs (worth 20 gp). In this scenario, both boggles originally came to the temple to steal this chicken. Or this might just be a tale the remaining boggle tells, planting false eggs with the chickens in order to better negotiate with the characters.": "{@area area 35|15f|x}的一只鸡可能是{@creature Thessalar|IMR}的实验品之一，这样它偶尔会下银蛋（价值10金币）甚至金蛋（价值20金币）。在这种情况下，这两个妖怪最初来到寺庙是为了偷这只鸡。或者这可能只是剩下的博格讲的一个故事，为了更好地与人物谈判，他用鸡下了假蛋。",
	"The presence of a legendary artifact in the final chapter of the adventure opens up lots of possibilities.": "在冒险的最后一章中出现了一个传说中的神器，这为我们提供了很多可能性。",
	"For deeper integration with {@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA}, an alternative climax could have the characters' chosen agent complete their version of the {@i Infernal Machine}—which is then converted into an infernal war machine. Such a process might involve drawing on other elements of the adventure's locations (the Tomb of Horrors' still-to-be-built stone juggernaut, the skeleton of the thessalkraken, and so forth) for use in the war machine's chassis.": "为了与{@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA}更深入地结合，另一个高潮可以让角色选择的代理人完成他们版本的{@i Infernal Machine}--然后将其转化为一个地狱战争机器。这个过程可能会涉及到借鉴冒险地点的其他元素（恐怖之墓中尚待建造的石质巨兽，thessalkraken的骨架，等等），以用于战争机器的底盘。",
	"The characters are then asked to drive the war machine into Avernus, to confront the minions of the archdevil opposed by their agent and thwart that archdevil's plans. Alternatively, the {@i Infernal War Machine} might be teleported to the Nine Hells, where the characters later encounter it during the course of {@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA} and are required to stop it.": "然后人物被要求将战争机器开进Avernus，与他们的代理人所反对的大恶魔的爪牙对峙，并挫败该大恶魔的计划。另外，{@i Infernal War Machine}可能会被传送到九层地狱，后来人物在{@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA}的过程中遇到了它，并被要求阻止它。",
	"So many of the iconic locations in D&D would make great additions to this adventure, from the tower of Sorcere in Menzoberranzan, to one of the elemental nodes in {@adventure Princes of the Apocalypse|PotA}, to the level of Dweomercore in {@adventure Dungeon of the Mad Mage|WDMM}, to Skyreach Castle in {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}.

	"Missing components could be hidden in any number of locations in the jungles of Chult, including the Lost City of Omu, or even integrated into the Tomb of the Nine Gods. For example, to recover a component located at the City of Omu's amphitheater, the characters might need to overcome the King of Feathers at some point in the past (making it a younger, weaker tyrannosaurus rex) or the future (where it has become a deadly dinosaur zombie).": "缺少的部件可能藏在楚尔特丛林中的任何一个地方，包括失落的奥穆城，甚至是整合到九神之墓中。例如，为了找回位于奥姆城圆形剧场的部件，角色们可能需要在过去的某个时间点（让它成为一只更年轻、更弱小的霸王龙）或未来（它已经成为一只致命的恐龙僵尸）战胜羽毛之王。",
	"The characters might need to travel back to a time when Keraptis first constructed his legendary dungeon (featured in {@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP}), and used components from the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad} to magically secure {@item Wave}, {@item Whelm}, and {@item Blackrazor} in place. Alternatively, he might trade missing components in his possession for the three famed weapons, which are still hidden elsewhere in the world, or for some of the monstrous creatures that will eventually guard the dungeon.": "人物可能需要回到Keraptis第一次建造他的传奇地牢（在{@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP}中出现）的时候，并使用{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}中的组件，用魔法将{@item Wave}、{@item Whelm}和{@item Blackrazor}固定住。另外，他可能会用手中缺失的部件换取仍藏在世界其他地方的三件著名的武器，或者换取一些最终将守护地宫的怪物。",
	"If you are playing this adventure alongside {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}, {@adventure White Plume Mountain|TftYP} offers a number of connections to that adventure's guides.

	"To let the characters dig even deeper into the world of the adventure, you can also consider adding a few more iconic NPCs.": "为了让人物更深入地挖掘冒险的世界，你还可以考虑增加一些标志性的NPC。",
	"If enmity arises between the characters and Acererak, the would-be lich is a formidable foe. You might make this special version of Acererak even more so by having him wielding a sword with a {@item sphere of annihilation} fashioned into its blade, and with the matching {@item talisman of the sphere} fashioned into the hilt.": "如果角色和阿塞拉克之间产生了敌意，这个可能的巫师就是一个可怕的敌人。你可以让他挥舞着一把剑，在剑刃上刻上{@item sphere of annihilation}，并在剑柄上刻上相应的{@item talisman of the sphere}，从而使这个特殊版本的阿塞拉克更加强大。",
	"A potential guide in {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}, Mary Greymalkin might appear in this adventure as a servant of {@creature Moghadam|IMR} or {@creature Thessalar|IMR}, a guide for the thieves who entered the Temple of Moloch, one of either agents' couriers, and so forth. As she does in {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}, she offers to let the characters draw from her {@i deck of several things}. Some of the deck's cards bestow effects more relevant to this adventure, as follows:": "作为{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}的潜在向导，玛丽-格雷马尔金可能会在这次冒险中作为{@creature Moghadam|IMR}或{@creature Thessalar|IMR}的仆人出现，成为进入摩洛神庙的盗贼的向导，成为这两个特工的信使之一，等等。正如她在{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}中所做的那样，她提出让人物从她的{@i deck of several things}中抽出。这副牌中的一些牌赋予了与这次冒险更相关的效果，如下所示。",
