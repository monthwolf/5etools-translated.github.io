	"A fallen clock tower holds components from an ancient artifact. Upon discovery of the components, competing agents look to launch expeditions to uncover additional components scattered across distant places—and times. The now-lost Temple of Moloch and the construction site of the legendary {@adventure Tomb of Horrors|TftYP} are two of those locations.

But a few persisted, controlled by those able to glean some partial understanding of their operation.": "早期的探险队也偶然发现了坠机地点，虽然大多数探险队在钻研飞船时丧生，但也有少数人设法找到了这个世界上最伟大的思想家都没有想到的稀有物品。这些物品中的许多后来随着时间的推移而丢失，大多数导致其主人在途中死亡。但也有少数人坚持了下来，被那些能够对其运作有部分了解的人所控制。",
	"Among the most important of these relics was the planar craft's central command console, used to guide its flight through space and time. Legend of this object grew as it fell into the hands of a warlord and came to be known as a most powerful artifact: the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad} (so named after its last owner). Yet with the defeat of Baron Lum, his {@i Infernal Machine} was said to have been destroyed as well.": "这些遗物中最重要的是平面飞行器的中央指挥台，用来指导它在空间和时间中的飞行。当这个东西落入一个军阀手中时，它的传说越来越多，被称为最强大的神器：{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}（以其最后的主人命名）。然而，随着卢姆男爵的失败，他的{@i Infernal Machine}据说也被摧毁了。",

Bel is the deposed former master of that layer. But to rebuild the infernal machine, both devils require a number of missing components—former control buttons vital to the machine's operation.

	"Whichever hook you choose, the adventure begins while the characters are traveling through a remote fey wood. If {@i Infernal Machine Rebuild} is played in combination with {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}, this could be part of the thick band of woods surrounding the pass leading into the Barrier Peaks, known to be infused with the power of the Feywild.

	"Three hags form a coven, which results in heightened power. For higher-level characters, run the hags with their coven benefits to make a hard encounter.

Since her arrival, the dark-hearted unicorn has hunted goodly fey into near extinction, with the help of evil creatures that now serve her.\"": "\"就像善良的神灵指派独角兽保护圣地一样，\"雄鹿妈妈解释说，\"班瑞恩为一个邪恶的神灵服务，后者派她来破坏这些和平的森林。自从她来到这里，这只黑心的独角兽在现在为她服务的邪恶生物的帮助下，已经把善良的费伊人猎杀到几乎灭绝。\"",
	"The three mothers offer to serve as guides, leading the characters safely through the woods to their original destination. But in exchange, they ask for assistance in defeating this evil unicorn. They do not want Banrion killed, however. Instead, if the characters can capture the unicorn, Mother Stag claims that they can undo her corruption—and perhaps even convert her to more goodly ways. (In reality, the hags wish to capture the unicorn and force her to become their servant and mount.)": "三位母亲主动提出充当向导，带领人物安全地穿过森林，到达他们原来的目的地。但作为交换，她们要求帮助她们打败这个邪恶的独角兽。然而，她们并不希望班瑞恩被杀。相反，如果角色们能抓住独角兽，雄鹿妈妈声称他们可以消除她的腐败--甚至可能让她改邪归正。(实际上，雄鹿们希望抓住独角兽，强迫她成为他们的仆人和坐骑）。",
	"To help the characters in this task, the three mothers have corrupted a {@item bridle of capturing|IMR} (see {@adventure appendix C|IMR|8}), which can control the unicorn and allow it to be led back to them. (Even though the bridle normally targets only beasts, the hags' magic allows this bridle to target Banrion specifically.)": "为了帮助人物完成这项任务，三位母亲腐蚀了一个{@item bridle of capturing|IMR}（见{@adventure appendix C|IMR|8}），它可以控制独角兽，让它被引回他们身边。(尽管辔头通常只针对野兽，但女巫们的魔法使这个辔头可以专门针对班瑞恩)。",
	"If a crown is closely examined by a character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) or Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, or with a {@spell detect magic} spell cast using a 3rd-level or higher spell slot, the nature of its magic is discovered.": "如果一个角色在DC20智力（{@skill Nature}）或智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查中成功地仔细检查了王冠，或者用3级以上的法术槽施展了{@spell detect magic}法术，它的魔法性质就会被发现。",
	"The dryad-hags lead the characters toward the clock tower bridge, but are too frightened of the unicorn to approach any closer. They leave Olitor to guide the characters the rest of the way. The satyr-redcap leads the characters to the edge of the ruins before sneaking off to hide and spy on their progress.": "干尸巫师带领人物走向钟楼桥，但他们太害怕独角兽了，不敢再靠近了。他们留下了Olitor来引导角色走完剩下的路。萨提尔-红帽带领角色们来到废墟的边缘，然后偷偷地躲起来，窥视他们的进展。",
	"As the characters make their way toward Banrion's lair, they come across the ruins of an old clock tower, which make an unusual and dangerous bridge.": "当人物向班瑞恩的巢穴进发时，他们遇到了一座旧钟楼的废墟，它是一座不寻常的危险桥梁。",
	"The trees part to reveal the ruins of an ancient city. All that remains are worn flagstones covered in moss and lichen, toppled blocks of weathered stone, and a former tower fallen and now lying stretched across a fifty-foot-wide chasm.": "树木分开，露出了一座古城的废墟。剩下的只是覆盖着苔藓和地衣的破旧旗杆石，倒下的风化石块，以及一座曾经倒下的塔，现在横卧在50英尺宽的鸿沟中。",
	"The chasm fully circles an isolated plateau of rock at its center. More ruins rise atop this plateau, including sections of walls held together by the roots of stunted trees. On the near side of the chasm, the base of the fallen tower can be seen, reduced to a broken section of its former ground floor. ": "鸿沟完全环绕着其中心的一个孤立的岩石高原。更多的废墟耸立在这个高原上，包括由矮小的树根支撑起来的部分墙壁。在鸿沟的近旁，可以看到倒下的塔的底座，只剩下以前地面上的一段断裂。",
	"The collapsed structure crosses the 100-foot-deep chasm and appears extremely unstable. (Banrion can teleport across the chasm, but does so only rarely. Because she can teleport only once per day, she is wary of being stuck on the other side if the hags' servants are nearby.) The foundation of the tower still rests on the forest side of the chasm—and holds the instrument panel that formerly operated the tower's time mechanism.": "坍塌的结构横跨100英尺深的鸿沟，看起来极其不稳定。(Banrion可以传送过鸿沟，但只是很少这样做。因为她每天只能传送一次，如果女巫的仆人在附近，她就会警惕地被卡在另一边）。塔的地基仍然在鸿沟的森林一侧，并保留着以前操作塔的时间机制的仪表板。",
	"The characters can attempt to cross over using the fallen tower as a bridge, or they might discover the controls within the foundation that allow the bridge to be stabilized.": "角色们可以尝试利用倒下的塔作为桥梁越过，或者他们可能会发现地基内的控制装置，使桥梁得以稳定。",
	"A character can attempt to cross the chasm using the exterior of the fallen clock tower as a bridge, or using its interior as a tunnel. Either way, the character must succeed on two DC 14 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) checks to safely cross. Characters who are roped together gain no benefit for these checks, but are in a better position to help each other if one falls.": "一个角色可以尝试用倒下的钟楼的外部作为桥梁，或者用它的内部作为隧道来跨越鸿沟。无论哪种方式，角色都必须通过两次DC14的灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）检查才能安全穿越。被绑在一起的角色在这些检查中没有任何好处，但是如果有一个人掉下去，他们会处于更好的位置来帮助对方。",
	"On a first failed check, pieces of the tower crumble and fall 100 feet to the bottom of the chasm, but the character is unharmed. On a second failed check, more crumbling rock trips up or batters the character, who takes 4 ({@dice 1d8}) bludgeoning damage and falls. A character who is not roped to another character or some solid part of the tower falls 100 feet, taking {@dice 10d6} bludgeoning damage.": "在第一次检查失败的情况下，塔的碎片碎裂并掉落到100英尺的鸿沟底部，但角色没有受到伤害。在第二次检查失败时，更多的碎石会绊倒或撞击角色，角色会受到4({@dice 1d8})的重击伤害并坠落。没有被绳索绑在另一个角色或塔的某个坚固部分上的角色会跌落100英尺，受到{@dice 10d6}重击伤害。",
	"If failed checks cause significant sections of the tower to crumble, you might decide that the DC of the check to climb across increases, or that checks are made with disadvantage.": "如果检查失败导致塔的重要部分崩塌，你可能会决定增加爬过塔的检查DC，或者以劣势进行检查。",
	"Within the foundation of the tower on the near side of the chasm, an instrument panel is built into the wall.

	"A successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) or Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check notices two gemstone-like buttons lying on the ground nearby, one a deep red and one a light blue, and both made of some unknown material. The buttons are two of the missing components of the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}, as the characters will discover.": "成功通过DC10智力({@skill Investigation})或智慧({@skill Perception})检查，可以注意到附近地面上躺着两个类似宝石的按钮，一个是深红色，一个是浅蓝色，都是由某种未知的材料制成。钮扣是{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}的两个缺失的部件，人物会发现这一点。",
	"Two empty slots in the panel once housed the components before they fell loose. A successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check identifies the components as associated with the transmutation school of magic—and specifically, with the transmutation of time. If the components are placed back in the panel, a successful DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check allows them to be used to adjust a localized time field surrounding the tower in either direction.": "在面板上有两个空槽，在它们松动之前曾经放置过这些组件。成功通过DC12智力({@skill Arcana})检查，可以确定这些组件与魔法的转化学派有关，特别是与时间的转化有关。如果这些组件被放回面板中，成功通过DC14智力({@skill Arcana})检查，就可以用它们来调整塔周围任何方向的局部时间场。",
	"The red component allows the time field to be adjusted toward the future. If the check to do so is successful, the tower begins to rapidly age and crumble. If advanced too far, or if any check made to operate the red component is failed by 10 or more, the tower collapses into the valley with a resounding crash.": "红色部分允许时间场向未来调整。如果这样做的检查成功，塔开始迅速老化和崩溃。如果推进得太远，或者任何操作红色组件的检查都失败了10次或更多，塔就会在巨大的撞击声中倒塌到山谷中。",
	"The blue component allows the time field to be adjusted toward the past. If the check to do so is successful, the tower begins to revert back to its original condition. If this process is stopped before the tower returns to its standing position, it becomes a stable bridge that can be crossed without ability checks.": "蓝色组件允许时间场向过去调整。如果这样做的检查是成功的，塔就开始恢复到它的原始状态。如果这个过程在塔回到它的站立位置之前被阻止，它就会变成一座稳定的桥，无需能力检查就可以通过。",
	"Adjusting the time field affects only the tower. Other creatures and objects that might happen to be in or on the tower at the time remain unaffected.": "调整时间场只影响到塔。当时可能碰巧在塔内或塔上的其他生物和物体仍然不受影响。",
	"The rocky plateau beyond the chasm holds the crumbled shell of an ancient castle. Banrion the unicorn makes her home here, along with a number of goodly fey who shelter in a network of tiny tunnels within the ruins. Having long been hunted by the hags and their evil servants, these fey—including sprites, pixies, and good boggles and satyrs—are too weak and terrified to help in any fight.": "鸿沟外的岩石高原上有一座古老城堡的碎裂外壳。独角兽班瑞恩在这里安家，还有一些在废墟中的小隧道网络中避难的善良的费伊人。由于长期被女巫和她们邪恶的仆人追杀，这些精灵--包括精灵、小精灵、善良的博格和萨提尔--都太过虚弱和恐惧，无法帮助任何战斗。",
	"The {@creature unicorn} Banrion defends her home and its inhabitants with her life. If the characters threaten or attack her here, she fights to the finish, refusing to teleport away. But if the characters have peaceful intent (most likely because they saw through the dryad-hags' ruse, or they simply want to assess Banrion's nature themselves), they can approach unarmed and announcing themselves. With appropriate roleplaying or a DC 16 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, Banrion accepts that the characters mean her no harm. If the hags are still at large, she beseeches the characters to help her defeat them.": "{@creature unicorn}班瑞恩用她的生命来保卫她的家园和居民。如果角色在这里威胁或攻击她，她会战斗到底，拒绝传送离开。但是如果角色有和平的意图（很可能是因为他们看穿了干尸巫师的诡计，或者他们只是想自己评估一下Banrion的本性），他们可以不带武器地接近并宣布自己。通过适当的角色扮演或DC16魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查，班瑞恩接受了这些角色对她没有恶意。如果女巫仍然逍遥法外，她恳求这些人物帮助她打败她们。",
	"If the characters agree to fight the hags, Banrion joins them. But she asks that before the fight, the characters help escort the fey living in the ruins across the bridge, then manipulate the fallen clock tower back to its standing position. This seals off her plateau defensively, denying it to the hags in case she falls. (If she survives, the unicorn remains able to teleport across the chasm.) In this way, the characters discover the tower's controls if they have not already.": "如果角色们同意与女巫作战，班瑞恩会加入他们。但她要求在战斗前，角色们帮助护送住在废墟中的费伊人过桥，然后操纵倒下的钟楼回到其站立位置。这样就可以防御性地封住她的高原，万一她倒下了，就会被女巫们拒绝。(如果她能活下来，独角兽仍能传送到鸿沟对面。）通过这种方式，角色们发现了塔的控制权，如果他们还没有的话。",
	"If asked, Banrion knows only that the clock tower was once part of an ancient city. She describes its controls as \"a magical machine of gems and silver,\" but has not approached too closely for fear of the magic it radiates. As for who built the city, she cannot say, as it fell to ruin even before her time.": "如果问起，班瑞恩只知道这座钟楼曾经是一座古城的一部分。她把它的控制装置描述为 \"由宝石和银子组成的神奇机器\"，但由于担心它所散发的魔力而没有太过接近。至于谁建造了这座城市，她不能说，因为它甚至在她的时代之前就已经沦为废墟了。",
	"In D&D canon, Lum the Mad discovered an artifact of unknown origin (reimagined in this adventure as technology from a crashed planar craft) and used it to conquer large territories in Greyhawk's world of Oerth.": "在D&D典籍中，疯狂的卢姆发现了一件来历不明的艺术品（在这次冒险中被重新想象为来自坠毁的星球飞船的技术），并利用它征服了格雷霍克的奥尔斯世界中的大片领土。",
	"Opposing him was his former general, Leuk-O, who discovered a second artifact—a \"relic of a visiting race of space travelers.\" This magic suit of powered armor became known as the {@i Mighty Servant of Leuk-O}.": "反对他的是他的前将军，Leuk-O，他发现了第二件文物--\"一个来访的太空旅行者种族的遗迹\"。这套神奇的动力盔甲被称为{@i Mighty Servant of Leuk-O}。",
	"If Banrion is bridled, she must obey the characters as they deliver her to the dryad-hags. Assuming the characters don't uncover the hags' deception (or if they don't care), the unicorn's fate is a sad one, as the woods fall under the Three Mothers' corruption. ": "如果Banrion被束缚住了，她就必须服从人物的命令，把她交给干尸巫师。假设人物没有揭穿干尸的骗局（或者他们不在乎），独角兽的命运是悲惨的，因为森林陷入了三母的腐败。",
	"In this event, some time after the characters depart, they are visited by a knightly {@creature sprite} on a {@creature stirge} mount, who has hunted the party down to demand a duel by combat. He explains what the characters have really done, and offers to lead the characters back to the woods to right their wrongs if they can be persuaded to.": "在这个事件中，在人物离开一段时间后，一个骑着{@creature stirge}坐骑的骑士{@creature sprite}来拜访他们，他追捕他们，要求进行战斗决斗。他解释了这些人物的真实行为，并提出如果他们能被说服的话，可以带领这些人物回到森林中去纠正他们的错误。",
	"If the characters defeat the hags, Banrion returns to prominence and drives the rest of the wicked fey out of the woods. Before the characters depart, she asks them to once more use the panel at the clock tower bridge, adjusting time back toward the past. Combined with her own magical influence, this allows the unicorn to separate the myconids from the trees, returning the woods to their former condition.": "如果角色们打败了女巫，班瑞恩就会重出江湖，并将其他邪恶的精灵赶出森林。在人物离开之前，她要求他们再一次使用钟楼桥的面板，将时间调整到过去。再加上她自己的魔法影响，这使得独角兽能够将菌类从树木中分离出来，使森林恢复到以前的状态。",
	"With the hags defeated, Banrion has no further need for the clock tower panel's magical power. She insists that the characters take the two components, both as a reward and as items worthy of magical study. (She is also keen to ensure that the panel can never be used again to adjust time, in case doing so causes the hags or their corruption to return).": "随着女巫被打败，班瑞恩不再需要钟楼面板的魔力了。她坚持让这些人物拿走这两个部件，既作为奖励，也作为值得研究的魔法物品。(她也很想确保钟楼面板不能再被用来调整时间，以防止这样做会导致女巫或她们的堕落回来）。",
	"If the characters research the components or the ancient city, a successful DC 18 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill History}) check leads to the discovery that the city was the site from which Lum the Mad seized the great artifact that bears his name—and that the two components were once part of that artifact.": "如果角色研究这些部件或古城，成功通过DC18智力（{@skill Arcana}或{@skill History}）检查，就会发现这个城市是疯子卢姆夺取以他名字命名的伟大神器的地方，而这两个部件曾经是那个神器的一部分。",
	"After the characters return from the woods (or at any appropriate time depending on which adventure hooks you've used), the party is sought out by two competing agents. {@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR} and {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} are both searching for any missing components from the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}, and their spies have returned with news of the characters' knowledge or possession of the components from the clock tower.

Each agent now desires to launch a new expedition to these locations—but to a different time in the past when the missing components might still be recoverable.": "通过他们自己对传说、古籍、期刊等的研究（以及互相刺探），两名特工都找到了更多失踪的部件。然而，最近对这些文本中描述的地点进行的探险被证明是没有结果的，失踪的部件被发现是丢失的、被破坏的，或者被锁在凡人无法到达的地方。每位特工现在都希望对这些地点进行新的考察--但要到过去的不同时期，那时失踪的部件可能还能恢复。",

Chief among those causes is the defeat of the servants of the archdevil Bel. An eccentric dilettante, Lynx has had her thick horns intricately carved and inlaid with sigils and figures in silver, including multiple images of her namesake lynx.

Several of her teeth have also been replaced with precious stones and metals.": "她以一个盗贼流氓的身份出现，{@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR}谈到她是如何作为一个冒险家退休的，以利用她收集的财富和收集的古物为更高尚的事业服务。这些事业中最主要的是打败大恶魔贝尔的仆人。猞猁是个古怪的二流子，她的厚厚的角上精雕细琢，镶嵌着银色的符号和数字，包括她同名的猞猁的多个图像。她的一只眼睛也因为以前的冒险不幸而失去了，取而代之的是一只朦胧的水晶玻璃眼。她的几颗牙齿也被换成了珍贵的宝石和金属。",
	"In truth, Lynx is an active agent of Zariel but is no longer among the living. Rather, she's a lawful evil undead tiefling, with her skeleton specially crafted to retain her former skills and intellect, and bonded to an equally special flesh golem that she wears as a costumed skin. (If you are playing through {@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA}, this setup was one of Mad Maggie's creations while the hag was in Zariel's employ.) Beneath this golem costume, Lynx's bones are carved and silver-scribed in the same manner as her horns. She uses her skull, which is locked and accessed from inside the back of her mouth, as a container for her most private treasures.": "事实上，林克斯是扎里尔的一个活跃的特工，但却不再是活人了。相反，她是一个合法的邪恶的不死铁弗林，她的骨架是专门制作的，以保留她以前的技能和智力，并与一个同样特殊的肉体格姆结合在一起，她把它当作服装的皮肤。(如果你在玩穿越{@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA}，这个设置是疯狂的麦琪在受雇于扎里尔时的创作之一。) 在这套魔像服装下，猞猁的骨头被雕刻成与她的角一样的银色。她用她的头骨作为她最私人的宝物的容器，而她的头骨是锁着的，可以从她嘴的后面进入。",
	"If the characters accept Lynx's invitation, she meets them while strolling the long hallways of her manor, the walls of which are filled with fine paintings. Rather than noting their artists or subjects, however, Lynx describes each painting based on where she stole it from.": "如果人物接受了林克斯的邀请，她就会在她的庄园的长长的走廊上与他们见面，墙上挂满了精美的绘画。然而，林克斯并没有注意到他们的艺术家或主题，而是根据她从哪里偷来的画来描述每一幅画。",
	"As she talks with the characters, Lynx relates that several of the missing components are mentioned in various legends surrounding the Tomb of Horrors, but recent expeditions sent to the tomb have all failed to return. Lynx believes that an expedition should instead be sent to an earlier time in the tomb's construction, when the missing components are known to be there. She further theorizes that existing components of the {@i Infernal Machine} (either those the characters have brought to her, or those already in her possession) could allow time to be manipulated in some localized fashion within the tomb.": "当她与这些人物交谈时，林克斯说，在围绕恐怖之墓的各种传说中提到了几个失踪的部件，但最近派往该墓的探险队都没有回来。猞猁认为，应该把探险队派到古墓建造的较早时期，那时已知失踪的部件就在那里。她进一步推测，现有的{@i Infernal Machine}组件（要么是那些人物带给她的，要么是那些已经在她手中的）可以让时间在古墓中以某种局部的方式被操纵。",

He is secretly a warrior in the service of Bel, and has sworn vengeance against all those who would oppose Bel and the archdevil's struggle to reclaim Avernus—especially followers of Zariel.": "然而，{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}并不是他所表现出来的光荣的骑士。他暗地里是一个为贝尔服务的战士，并发誓要对所有反对贝尔和大恶魔夺回阿弗纳斯的斗争的人进行报复，特别是扎里尔的追随者。",

	"Ursas states that he seeks the missing components in order to complete his version of the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}. When complete, the powerful artifact will allow him to finish the military campaign he started long ago, letting him return to Avernus and take on the forces of Zariel. Further, he is open about his rivalry with Lynx. He claims that the retired rogue is after the missing components only to add them to her collection of stolen rarities, and that she has no intention of putting them into the service of good.": "Ursas说他在寻找缺失的部件，以便完成他的{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}的版本。完成后，这个强大的神器将使他能够完成他很久以前开始的军事行动，让他回到阿弗纳斯并对付扎里尔的部队。此外，他还公开了他与林克斯的竞争关系。他声称，这个退役的流氓追寻失踪的部件只是为了将它们加入她偷来的稀有物品的收藏中，而她并不打算将它们用于正义的事业。",
	"Ursas is aware that Lynx has knowledge of other missing components that might relate to the Tomb of Horrors.": "Ursas知道Lynx知道其他可能与恐怖之墓有关的失踪部件。",
	"{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} offers the characters the services of a magical construct built to resemble a smaller version of the {@i Mighty Servant of Leuk-O}, and which is nicknamed Luke.

If the characters possess any missing components, he asks to buy those so that they can be added to the construct as well.": "{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}为角色们提供了一个神奇的构造物的服务，这个构造物与{@i Mighty Servant of Leuk-O}的缩小版相似，并被昵称为卢克。该建筑由Ursas收集的{@i Infernal Machine}组件之一提供动力。如果人物拥有任何缺失的部件，他要求购买这些部件，以便将它们也添加到该建筑中。",
	"See the \"{@area Mechanical Guides|047|x}\" section below for information on Luke's statistics.

	"This adventure is designed to provide plenty of options for you as the DM, and to help give the players a strong sense of agency and choice.": "这个冒险的设计是为了给你这个管理员提供大量的选择，并帮助给玩家一个强烈的代理和选择的感觉。",
	"The characters can ally themselves with either agent, whether choosing to deal with the first agent they meet, or meeting both before making a choice. They might even meet with both in order to play one against the other. They might distrust both agents and ally with neither, instead undertaking the adventure on their own to capture the missing components and prevent them falling into the wrong hands. In the latter case, you simply need to arrange for them to gain access to their own mechanical guide, whether through theft, purchase, or an alternative patron (such as Kwalish).": "人物可以与任何一个特工结盟，无论是选择与他们遇到的第一个特工打交道，还是在做出选择之前与两个特工见面。他们甚至可以同时与两个人见面，以便让一个人对抗另一个人。他们可能不信任这两个特工，不与任何一个结盟，而是自己进行冒险，捕捉失踪的部件，防止它们落入坏人手中。在后一种情况下，你只需要安排他们获得自己的机械指南，无论是通过偷窃、购买，还是通过其他赞助人（如Kwalish）。",
	"Depending on which agent they ally themselves with, the characters will initially travel to either the Tomb of Horrors or the Temple of Moloch. If you want to focus on only one location in the adventure, that's fine. But plot hooks and NPC interactions at each location give you lots of opportunity to inspire or compel the characters to travel to the second location, either after or in conjunction with exploring the first location.": "根据他们与哪个特工结盟，人物最初将前往恐怖之墓或摩洛神庙。如果你想在冒险中只关注一个地点，那也可以。但每个地点的情节钩子和NPC互动给了你很多机会来激发或迫使角色去第二个地点，无论是在探索第一个地点之后还是在探索第一个地点的过程中。",
	"Each guide is an unaligned Medium construct with AC 20, 50 hit points, and a speed of 20 feet. It has no attacks, and has a +0 modifier for all its ability scores.": "每个向导都是一个不结盟的中型结构体，AC为20，50点命中率，速度为20英尺。它没有攻击力，所有的能力值都是+0的修正值。",
	"Each guide has 6 charges, and regains {@dice 1d6} expended charges daily at dawn. Teleporting itself and the party to either adventure locale or back to its home manor costs a guide 1 charge. A guide can also be commanded to spend 1 or more charges to manipulate time in the local area at either adventure location. See \"{@area Manipulating Time|049|x}\" below for more information.": "每个向导有6个电荷，并且每天在黎明时分重新获得{@dice 1d6}已消耗的电荷。将自己和队伍传送到任何一个冒险地点或回到自己的庄园，都要花费向导1个电荷。导游也可以被命令花费1个或更多的费用来操纵任何一个冒险地点的当地时间。更多信息见下面的\"{@area Manipulating Time|049|x}\"。",
	"All damage dealt to a guide can be restored during a long rest with a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools or tinker's tools. A damaged guide can also be restored to full hit points by the use of a {@spell mending} spell or similar magic. If reduced to 0 hit points, the guide is destroyed and no longer functions—possibly stranding the characters in the distant past. {@adventure Chapter 3|IMR|3} and {@adventure chapter 4|IMR|4} each offer appropriate suggestions for how the characters might repair or replace a destroyed guide.": "导游受到的所有伤害可以在长时间的休息中通过使用盗贼的工具或工匠的工具进行成功的DC14灵巧检查来恢复。受损的向导也可以通过使用{@spell mending}的咒语或类似的魔法恢复到全部命中率。如果降低到0命中率，指南就会被摧毁，不再起作用--可能会把人物困在遥远的过去。{@adventure Chapter 3|IMR|3}和{@adventure chapter 4|IMR|4}分别对人物如何修复或替换被破坏的指南提供了适当的建议。",
	"Each guide follows the party and obeys all the characters' commands. If two characters issue commands to the guide at the same time, you decide how the commands are resolved.": "每个向导都跟随队伍，服从所有人物的命令。如果两个角色同时向向导发出命令，你决定如何解决这些命令。",
	"If the characters meet with both agents, they might agree to work for both without the other agent knowing. In that case, it's possible that they acquire both mechanical guides. You can decide whether the programming of the two constructs causes them to bicker and one-up each other—or whether each guide attempts to sabotage and destroy its counterpart. Or you might decide that they develop a mutual respect for each other, perhaps even becoming friends as a result of their shared adventures. If on friendly terms, a guide can restore any damage dealt to its counterpart during a short rest, by willingly sacrificing parts for the other.": "如果人物与这两个特工见面，他们可能会同意为这两个特工工作而不被另一个特工知道。在这种情况下，他们有可能获得两个机械向导。你可以决定这两个构造物的程序是否会导致他们争吵和互相指责，或者每个引导者是否试图破坏和摧毁其对应物。或者，你可以决定他们发展出相互尊重的关系，甚至可能因为他们共同的冒险而成为朋友。如果是友好关系，向导可以在短暂的休息中恢复对其同伴造成的任何伤害，愿意为对方牺牲一部分。",
	"The ability to manipulate time at either the Tomb of Horrors or the Temple of Moloch is a fun part of the adventure, so make sure the players are clear on the parameters for doing so. The following information reflects what the characters learn from the mechanical guide they work with:": "在恐怖之墓或摩洛神庙操纵时间的能力是冒险的一个有趣部分，所以要确保玩家清楚地了解这样做的参数。下面的信息反映了人物从他们工作的机械指南中了解到的情况。",
	"The {@i Infernal Machine} components placed into the mechanical guides allow the characters to order a guide to spend 1 or more charges to alter time within individual areas of the Tomb of Horrors and the Temple of Moloch. If the localized time in an area at either site can be altered, that area's description has a \"Manipulating Time\" section, detailing the effects that result when a mechanical guide spends charges to alter the flow of time in that area.": "放在机械导引器中的{@i Infernal Machine}组件允许角色命令导引器花费1个或更多的费用来改变恐怖之墓和摩洛神庙的个别区域的时间。如果这两个地方的某个区域的局部时间可以被改变，那么该区域的描述中有一个 \"操纵时间 \"的部分，详细说明了当机械向导花钱改变该区域的时间流时产生的效果。",
	"A guide spends 1 or more charges using its action. Commanding a guide to spend a charge requires no action.": "一个向导使用其行动来花费1个或多个冲锋。指挥一个向导花费一个冲锋，不需要任何行动。",
	"Neither the characters nor the agents know in advance which rooms are subject to localized time effects, which areas can be affected by multiple charges, whether spending charges advances or rewinds time, or if the effects will be helpful, harmful, or simply wondrous in nature. Ultimately, some amount of experimentation might be necessary.": "角色和代理人都不知道哪些房间会受到局部时间效应的影响，哪些区域会受到多次收费的影响，花钱是为了让时间前进还是倒退，或者这些效应是有益的、有害的，还是仅仅是奇妙的性质。最终，某种程度的实验可能是必要的。",
	"By spending 1 or more charges in an area, a mechanical guide alters the flow of time within that area in a limited way. As time flows forward or backward, the characters see the area and its occupants move like ghosts into the future or the past, then settle back into the normal time frame once more. As was seen at the clock tower in chapter 1, this time manipulation affects only the immediate area and that area's original inhabitants. The characters, any creatures accompanying them, and any creatures that enter the area while time is shifting are not affected.": "通过在一个区域花费1个或更多的费用，一个机械向导以有限的方式改变了该区域的时间流。当时间向前或向后流动时，人物会看到这个区域和它的居民像幽灵一样移动到未来或过去，然后再一次回到正常的时间框架中。正如第一章中在钟楼看到的那样，这种时间操纵只影响到附近的区域和该区域的原始居民。人物、陪伴他们的任何生物，以及在时间转移时进入该区域的任何生物都不受影响。",
	"For example, having a mechanical guide spend 1 or more charges in a specific room might cause that room's occupants to move to a different location, as local time speeds forward or back to a point when those occupants are going on or off duty, starting or ending a rest period, and so on. The characters and other outside observers see the affected occupants retreating or advancing in time, but cannot interact with them.": "例如，让一个机械向导在一个特定的房间里花费1个或更多的电荷，可能会导致这个房间里的人移动到不同的位置，因为当地的时间加速前进或后退到一个点，当这些人要上岗或下班，开始或结束一个休息时间，等等。人物和其他外部观察者会看到受影响的住户在时间上撤退或前进，但不能与他们互动。",
	"Once the affected creatures arrive at their new time and location, they start acting as they normally would from that point forward. This means that creatures going back in time have their memories revert, such that they forget any interactions with characters in the area they just left. Likewise, time-manipulated creatures will suddenly \"discover\" characters if they encounter them in the area where they return to normal time.": "一旦受影响的生物到达他们的新时间和新地点，他们就会从那一刻开始像平常一样行动。这意味着回到过去的生物的记忆会恢复，这样他们就会忘记与他们刚刚离开的区域内的人物的任何互动。同样地，被时间操纵的生物如果在他们回到正常时间的区域遇到人物，就会突然 \"发现 \"他们。",
	"By manipulating time in either adventure locale, NPCs and monsters can be moved into new positions so that combat can be avoided (even if that combat is already underway). Likewise, characters who fail badly in negotiations with NPCs can try to wind back the clock to replay those negotiations as desired.": "通过操纵冒险地点的时间，NPC和怪物可以被移到新的位置，这样就可以避免战斗（即使战斗已经开始了）。同样，在与NPC的谈判中严重失败的角色可以尝试让时间倒流，以重新进行所需的谈判。",
	"The Tomb of Horrors is one of the most legendary dungeons in the multiverse. Shaped by the demilich Acererak as a testing ground for would-be heroes—and as a place to steal the souls of those heroes whose skills where found wanting—the tomb has claimed countless lives over millennia, and even some of the most hardened adventurers would think twice about entering those deadly halls. But by going back into the past, the characters have a chance to explore a version of the Tomb of Horrors that few have ever seen, and to engage one of the world's deadliest dungeons on their own terms.": "恐怖之墓是多元宇宙中最具传奇色彩的地牢之一。恐怖之墓是由半人半兽的阿克雷拉克（Acererak）塑造的，作为未来英雄的试验场，并作为窃取那些技能不足的英雄的灵魂的地方，千百年来夺去了无数人的生命，即使是一些最强硬的冒险家也会对进入这些致命的大厅三思而行。但是，通过回到过去，角色们有机会探索一个很少有人见过的恐怖之墓的版本，并以自己的方式参与世界上最致命的地牢之一。",
	"According to legend, Acererak was a tiefling fathered by a balor named {@creature Tarnhem|IMR}. In his youth, he studied spellcasting under Vecna, and has since become an archmage of surpassing evil. While researching the means to achieve lichdom, Acererak built a number of dungeons and tombs, including his famed Tomb of Horrors. Those dungeons were created partly as a means to draw out and defeat those adventurers driven to seek and destroy him—and partly to claim those adventurers' souls to feed his phylactery.": "根据传说，Acererak是一个名叫{@creature Tarnhem|IMR}的巴洛尔人所生的铁皮人。年轻时，他在韦克纳手下学习法术，此后成为一名超越邪恶的大法师。在研究实现巫术的方法时，阿塞拉克建造了许多地牢和坟墓，包括他著名的恐怖之墓。建造这些地牢的目的，一方面是为了引出并击败那些被驱使寻找并摧毁他的冒险者，另一方面是为了夺取这些冒险者的灵魂来喂养他的法器。",
	"Even after Acererak eventually became an archlich whose dark plots would threaten the world, he left behind the Tomb of Horrors as a monument to his greatness. But in its earliest stages, the tomb was a very different sort of place.": "即使在阿克雷拉克最终成为大法官，其黑暗的阴谋将威胁到世界之后，他仍然留下了恐怖之墓作为他伟大的纪念碑。但在其最初阶段，该墓是一个非常不同的地方。",
	"Over the years of the tomb's construction, {@creature Moghadam|IMR} and his rival artificer, {@creature Thessalar|IMR}, have competed fiercely against each other's endeavors. {@creature Moghadam|IMR} takes pleasure in having lured away several sculptors from {@creature Thessalar|IMR}'s temple to help with the tomb's construction. He has also recently sent a party of thieves and a master gemsmith to his rival's temple, instructing them to steal the temple's two most famous gems—set into the eyes of a great statue of Moloch—for use in the creation of Acererak's jeweled demilich skull. Unfortunately, those thieves have failed to return, and are presumed captured by {@creature Thessalar|IMR}.": "在建造坟墓的这些年里，{@creature Moghadam|IMR}和他的对手工匠，{@creature Thessalar|IMR}，对对方的努力进行了激烈的竞争。{@creature Moghadam|IMR}很高兴从{@creature Thessalar|IMR}的寺庙里引诱了几个雕塑家来帮助建造坟墓。他最近还派了一队盗贼和一位宝石大师去他的对手的神庙，指示他们偷取神庙里最有名的两颗宝石--镶嵌在摩洛神的大雕像的眼睛里--用于制造阿克拉克的宝石半身人头骨。不幸的是，这些小偷没有回来，估计是被{@creature Thessalar|IMR}抓住了。",
	"This version of the Tomb of Horrors takes place in the distant past, when various legendary figures of in-game history (Acererak included) still operate as mere mortals. Several of such figures have been included as NPCs, but you should not treat this adventure's approach to those characters as canon. Rather, use them to flesh out this particular adventure in \"what-if\" fashion. Alternatively, if you prefer not to populate the adventure with such prominent names, you can substitute those characters with unnamed general NPCs who can fill the same roles.": "这个版本的恐怖之墓发生在遥远的过去，当时游戏历史上的各种传奇人物（包括Acererak）仍然作为凡人活动。有几个这样的人物被列为NPC，但你不应该把这次冒险对这些人物的处理方式当作正统。相反，用他们来充实这个特定的冒险，以 \"假设 \"的方式。另外，如果你不愿意用这些著名的名字来充实这个冒险，你可以用没有名字的一般NPC来代替这些人物，他们可以担任同样的角色。",

	"The thessalheart construct has a telepathic bond to {@creature Thessalar|IMR}, who becomes aware of the characters through the construct's senses if they encounter it as they wander. If encountered, the construct gets close enough to identify the characters, then attempts to flee to protect itself.": "Thessalheart 构造物与 {@creature Thessalar|IMR} 有心灵感应的联系，如果角色在游荡时遇到它，它就会通过构造物的感官意识到他们。如果遇到了，这个构装体就会靠近，足以识别这些角色，然后试图逃离以保护自己。",

As they go, the agent talks about deducting expenses for any resources used, damage to the mechanical guide, and so forth—in general, becoming increasingly insidious.": "当人物与他们选择的代理人见面时，林克斯或{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}要求检查他们收集到的任何丢失的部件。代理人同意按照安排支付给人物，但只有在他们的仆人检验出这些部件处于工作状态之后。然后，这些人物被带到了代理商的车间。在他们走的时候，代理人说要扣除任何使用的资源的费用，对机械指南的损害，等等--总之，变得越来越阴险。",
	"When the characters first see the workshop, they become aware of the scope of what the agent is hoping to achieve.": "当人物第一次看到工作室时，他们就意识到代理人希望实现的范围。",
	"A door on the far side of the workshop opens, and six more assistants stride forth with a weary-looking prisoner in tow. A human male with a haughty bearing, and wearing tattered, once-regal clothes, the figure gazes up at the great machine with a sense of recognition and longing.": "车间远处的一扇门打开了，又有六个助手拖着一个看起来很疲惫的囚犯大步走来。这是一个傲慢的男性，穿着破烂的、曾经的贵族衣服，他抬头望着这台巨大的机器，眼神中充满了认同和渴望。",
	"Your host laughs, gesturing toward the figure with a flourish. \"Adventurers! May I present Lum the Mad!\"": "你的主人哈哈大笑，用手势示意这个人物。\"冒险家们! 请允许我介绍疯子卢姆！\"",
	"Lum uses the {@creature warlord|VGM} stat block, but is unarmed and has no attacks while under guard. He possesses sufficient knowledge to program the {@i Infernal Machine}, allowing it to fully function according to its description now that the missing components have been restored. In his state of low-grade madness, Lum has no reason to not follow the agent's orders and help bring the machine online. However, he is also able to deactivate the machine, or even cause it to self-destruct—if the characters can convince him to do so with appropriate roleplaying or Charisma checks of your determination.": "卢姆使用{@creature warlord|VGM}状态块，但没有武器，在守卫时没有攻击。他拥有足够的知识对{@i Infernal Machine}进行编程，允许它按照其描述完全运作，现在缺失的部件已经恢复了。在他低级的疯狂状态下，卢姆没有理由不听从特工的命令，帮助将机器上线。然而，他也能够停用机器，甚至使其自毁--如果角色能够通过适当的角色扮演或对你的决心进行魅力检查来说服他这样做。",
	"Immediately after the missing components are installed and Lum is presented, the other agent launches a surprise raid against the first agent's manor. Read the following, adding details as appropriate depending on whether Lynx or {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} is the one coming for the {@i Infernal Machine}, and whether or not the characters have met the other agent:": "在缺失的组件安装完毕，卢姆出现后，另一名特工立即对第一名特工的庄园发动了突袭。阅读下面的内容，根据猞猁或{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}是来找{@i Infernal Machine}的人，以及人物是否见过其他特工，酌情增加细节。",
	"A sudden shattering crash is heard as the wall of the workshop collapses to rubble! A fighting force advances through a cloud of dust, led by a most unusual-looking figure.": "当车间的墙壁坍塌成瓦砾时，突然传来了一声震耳欲聋的撞击声! 一支战斗部队在一片尘土中前进，领头的是一个看起来最不寻常的人物。",
	"During the fight, both agents shout out accusations that reveal the other's true natures. Those natures are then confirmed by the agents themselves. Any injury dealt to {@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR} shows the unnatural construction of her undead flesh and the rune-scribed skeleton beneath it. Any injury dealt to {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} causes him to shout out in rage, swearing vengeance \"in the name of my unholy patron, Bel!\"": "在战斗中，双方特工都大声指责对方，揭示了对方的真实本性。这些本性随后由特工们自己确认。任何对{@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR}造成的伤害都会显示出她不死之身的非自然构造和其下的符文骨架。任何对{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}的伤害都会导致他愤怒地大喊，发誓要 \"以我邪恶的守护者贝尔的名义 \"进行报复。",
	"If either agent gains control of the {@i Infernal Machine}, they immediately use it to attempt to defeat their rival. (The machine has all its normal functions except its {@spell wish} ability, which will require additional programming.) If confronted by the characters, the agent turns the {@i Infernal Machine} against them. If the characters leave the agent in control of the machine, the agent departs with it to the Nine Hells when their rival has been dealt with.": "如果任何一个特工获得了{@i Infernal Machine}的控制权，他们会立即使用它来试图击败他们的对手。(这台机器拥有所有的正常功能，除了它的{@spell wish}能力，这需要额外的编程。） 如果被角色撞见，特工就会用{@i Infernal Machine}来对付他们。如果角色们让特工控制机器，当他们的对手被解决后，特工就会带着机器离开，前往九层地狱。",
	"During the raid, any number of complications might arise. As desired, you can roll on the Machine Fight Complications table (see the next page) at the end of each round of combat, rerolling or ignoring results that have already occurred.": "在突袭过程中，可能会出现任何数量的复杂情况。根据需要，你可以在每轮战斗结束时在机器战斗并发症表（见下页）上滚动，重新滚动或忽略已经发生的结果。",

	"{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} slays Lynx. He tears her flesh golem suit away to reveal the skeleton within, which he then shatters. Lynx's skull might still remain animated and conversational.": "{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}杀死了林克斯。他把她的肉体盔甲撕开，露出里面的骨架，然后把它打碎。猞猁的头骨可能仍然保持着活力和对话性。",
	"Both Lynx and {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} decide that events have grown too heated and escape into the city. High bounties are set for their capture.": "猞猁和{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}都认为事件发展得太激烈了，于是逃到了城里。他们被高价悬赏捉拿。",
	"Depending on the hook you used and how this adventure fits into your overall campaign, a number of things can happen at the end of {@i Infernal Machine Rebuild}.": "根据你使用的钩子以及这个冒险如何适合你的整个活动，在{@i Infernal Machine Rebuild}的结尾会发生一些事情。",
	"If either agent is successful in taking the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad} to the Nine Hells, it changes the balance of power in Avernus. Either Zariel is able to solidify her rule of that level, or Bel is able to reclaim the level using the machine's power. What happens as a result is entirely up to you, and might come into play if you are running {@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA} as part of your campaign.": "如果任何一个特工成功地将{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}带到九层地狱，就会改变Avernus的权力平衡。要么扎里尔能够巩固她对该层的统治，要么贝尔能够利用机器的力量夺回该层。结果是什么完全取决于你，如果你把{@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA}作为你的竞选活动的一部分，可能就会发生作用。",
	"If the characters plan on keeping the missing {@i Infernal Machine} components for themselves, for delivery to another patron (such as Kwalish), or simply to keep them out of the hands of the agents, both Lynx and {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} launch separate attacks to recover them. These attacks can either be spaced out to avoid overwhelming the characters, or you can have both agents attack at the same time and largely concentrate on each other.": "如果角色们打算把丢失的{@i Infernal Machine}部件留给自己，交付给另一个赞助人（如Kwalish），或者仅仅是为了不让它们落入特工之手，那么Lynx和{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}都会发动单独的攻击来恢复它们。这些攻击可以间隔开来，以避免人物被压倒，或者你可以让两个特工同时攻击，主要集中在对方身上。",
	"If one or both of Lynx and {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} are defeated, the characters might end up in possession of the {@i Infernal Machine}. If you opt to keep this powerful artifact in your campaign, see {@adventure appendix C|IMR|8} for its statistics. Otherwise, you can decide that the machine has been fatally programmed to disperse its components to all-new locations—but only after the characters have had a bit of time to experiment with it.": "如果林克斯和{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}中的一个或两个都被打败了，角色可能最终会拥有{@i Infernal Machine}。如果你选择在你的战役中保留这个强大的神器，请参阅{@adventure appendix C|IMR|8}关于它的统计数据。否则，你可以决定这台机器被设计成致命的程序，将其部件分散到所有新的地点--但必须在人物有一点时间来试验它。",
	"Of course, if the characters take possession of the machine for any length of time, any surviving agents seek revenge against them. Likewise, so will the agents' patron archdevils, Zariel and Bel, who might send forces of cultists to finish the characters off.": "当然，如果这些角色占有机器的时间过长，任何幸存的特工都会对他们进行报复。同样，特工们的守护神扎里尔和贝尔也会这样做，他们可能会派邪教徒的部队来干掉这些角色。",
	"The mechanical guides are programmed to serve their agent masters—and to self-destruct in the event that anyone else attempts to take control of them. Still, exposure to the power of the components of the {@i Infernal Machine} might change a guide's programming, allowing the characters to befriend and permanently claim it as a companion or ally. If this happens, a guide's time traveling ability can be curtailed as you desire.": "机械导引器被设定为服务于它们的代理人主人--在其他人试图控制它们的情况下会自我毁灭。尽管如此，接触到{@i Infernal Machine}组件的力量可能会改变向导的程序，允许人物与它交好并永久地将其作为伙伴或盟友。如果发生这种情况，向导的时间旅行能力可以按照你的意愿被削减。",
	"Because this adventure traverses both time and space, you might decide that actions carried out by the characters in the past of chapters 3 and 4 create changes in the present of the campaign world when they return. For example, the construction of the Tomb of Horrors might be disrupted, in which case it holds less prominence in later times. If {@creature Thessalar|IMR} regains his missing sculptors, he might complete his stone golem and send it out to destroy {@creature Moghadam|IMR} and demolish the tomb while it's under construction. {@creature Thessalar|IMR} might also create more monsters than he is already known for, which can spread throughout the world.": "因为这次冒险穿越了时间和空间，所以你可以决定让角色在第三章和第四章的过去进行的行动在他们回来时对现在的活动世界产生变化。例如，恐怖之墓的建造可能会被破坏，在这种情况下，它在后来的时代中的地位就不那么突出了。如果{@creature Thessalar|IMR}重新找回了他失踪的雕塑家，他可能会完成他的石雕，并派它去摧毁{@creature Moghadam|IMR}，并在坟墓建设中拆除它。{@creature Thessalar|IMR}也可能创造出比他已经出名的更多的怪物，这些怪物可以在全世界传播。",
	"Feel free to keep track of what events and choices in the past might have future implications—and have fun presenting the fallout of those events to your players!": "请自由跟踪过去的哪些事件和选择可能会对未来产生影响--并在向你的玩家介绍这些事件的后果时获得乐趣。",
	"{@i Infernal Machine Rebuild} hopefully provides plenty of options for you to run the adventure the way that works best for your campaign. But if you'd like to customize this adventure even further, consider any of the following possibilities.": "{@i Infernal Machine Rebuild}，希望为你提供足够的选择，以最适合你的活动的方式进行冒险。但如果你想进一步定制这个冒险，可以考虑以下任何一种可能性。",
	"The conflict between the hags and the unicorn Banrion can be complicated or augmented in a number of ways.": "女巫和独角兽Banrion之间的冲突可以以多种方式复杂化或增强。",
	"If having three dryads working together is too immediate a tipoff that these might be hags forming a coven, you can add a fourth illusory mother to the mix to help allay suspicion. Created from a few logs and branches, Mother Hedgehog sits quietly in the corner of the cottage. If the characters attempt to speak with her, the programmed illusion is able to mumble a few incoherent words. A successful DC 16 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check detects this illusion.": "如果三个干尸在一起工作太过直接，让人觉得他们可能是女巫组成的女巫团，你可以在其中加入第四个虚幻的母亲，以帮助消除怀疑。用几根木头和树枝做成的刺猬妈妈，静静地坐在小屋的角落里。如果角色试图和她说话，这个程序化的幻象能够喃喃自语，说一些语无伦次的话。成功通过DC16智力({@skill Investigation})检查可以发现这个幻象。",
	"The hags' cottage is built from three trees entwined together. These trees might contain the three true dryads whose appearances the hags have stolen for their own use, and who have been enslaved by the hags to help with their corrupt gardening. If the characters treat with Banrion, the unicorn asks them to help free the dryads to set the woods back to order. ": "女巫的小屋是由三棵树缠绕在一起建成的。这些树可能包含了三个真正的干尸，她们的外表被女巫们窃取为己用，并被女巫们奴役，帮助她们进行腐败的园艺工作。如果人物与Banrion交谈，独角兽会要求他们帮助释放干尸，使森林恢复秩序。",
	"Instead of the hags being disguised as goodly dryads, you might instead choose to reverse the scenario. The Three Mothers might really be dryads in need of help, with Banrion the unicorn an evil creature that must be defeated to save the woods. The unicorn might even be using its dark magic to cause the dryads to appear as hags.": "与其把女巫伪装成善良的干尸，你可能会选择颠覆这个场景。三位母亲可能真的是需要帮助的干尸，而独角兽Banrion是邪恶的生物，必须被打败才能拯救森林。独角兽甚至可能使用它的黑暗魔法，使干尸们变成了巫婆。",
	"If the characters initially make an aggressive approach toward Banrion (whether because the hags have fooled them or because the unicorn is evil), you can make the fight tougher by having the unicorn appear while the characters are attempting to cross the clock tower bridge. While fighting on the bridge, Banrion looks to knock characters off the tower into the chasm below, or even to try to collapse the tower under the characters while she teleports away.": "如果角色最初对班瑞恩采取了积极的态度（无论是因为女巫欺骗了他们还是因为独角兽是邪恶的），你可以让独角兽在角色试图穿过钟楼桥时出现，从而使战斗更加艰难。在桥上战斗时，班瑞恩会把角色从塔上打到下面的鸿沟里，甚至在她传送走的时候试图把塔压在角色下面。",
	"If the unicorn later makes peace with the characters, she teleports down into the chasm (if still able to) and heals them.": "如果独角兽后来与人物和解，她就会传送到鸿沟里（如果还能传送的话）并治疗他们。",
	"Meeting with the infernal agents has the potential for a number of interesting story options.": "与无间道特工会面有可能产生一些有趣的故事选项。",
	"When the characters make their choice of which agent they want to work with, whatever agent they turn down immediately arranges to send out their own competing expedition. (If the characters agree to work for both agents, both agents might still send out second redundant expeditions as insurance.)": "当人物选择他们想与哪个代理人合作时，无论他们拒绝了哪个代理人，都会立即安排他们自己的竞争性探险队。(如果人物同意为两个代理人工作，两个代理人仍然可能派出第二个多余的探险队作为保险。)",
	"These expeditions are composed of five {@creature cultist} servants, led either by the {@creature enhanced medusa|IMR} for Lynx, or the brains in iron for {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} (see below for more information on both). Each expedition also has its own mechanical guide. You might use the members of the rival expedition to chase after the characters, or they might have already arrived at one of the locations and be set up for the characters to stumble upon. The members of the alternative expedition might set obstacles along the way, possibly inspiring the characters to do the same. Using the power of a mechanical guide might allow for the creation of particularly devious traps that can be set across space and time. And the members of the alternative expedition certainly look to sabotage or destroy the characters' mechanical guide in order to strand them.": "这些远征队由五个{@creature cultist}仆人组成，由{@creature enhanced medusa|IMR}的猞猁带领，或由{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}的铁脑袋带领（关于两者的更多信息见下文）。每个探险队也有自己的机械向导。你可以用对手的探险队成员来追赶角色，或者他们可能已经到达某个地点，并被安排好让角色偶然遇到。另一支探险队的成员可能会在路上设置障碍，可能会激励角色做同样的事。利用机械向导的力量，可以创造出特别狡猾的陷阱，可以跨越空间和时间来设置。而另类探险队的成员当然会破坏或摧毁人物的机械向导，以便将他们困住。",
	"These competitors might succeed in securing some of the missing components, whether they steal them out from under the characters or take them directly in combat. Any stolen components will be delivered to their respective agents before the characters return from the past.": "这些竞争者可能会成功地获得一些缺失的部件，不管他们是在角色下面偷出来的还是在战斗中直接拿走的。任何被盗的部件都将在人物从过去回来之前交付给他们各自的代理人。",
	"The {@creature enhanced medusa|IMR} uses the {@creature medusa} stat block with the following changes:": "{@creature enhanced medusa|IMR}使用{@creature medusa}的统计块，并做了以下改动。",

	"Its Petrifying Gaze trait turns creatures into metal, wood, or porcelain (the medusa's choice) rather than stone.": "它的石化凝视特性可以将生物变成金属、木头或瓷器（由美杜莎选择）而不是石头。",
	"If this adventure is played as a sequel to {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}, the {@creature enhanced medusa|IMR} might seek revenge for what befell its ancestor {@creature Gloine Nathair-Nathair|IMR}, or could be appeased with information regarding that medusa's whereabouts.": "如果这次冒险是作为{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}的续集，{@creature enhanced medusa|IMR}可能会为它的祖先{@creature Gloine Nathair-Nathair|IMR}的遭遇寻求报复，或者用关于那个美杜莎的下落的信息来安抚它。",
	"This creature originated from old designs of Kwalish, and takes the form of multiple brains that have been magically preserved and which collectively operate a new mechanical body. The brains share insights and knowledge with one another, and have typically been taken from creatures that desired to prolong their consciousness—or that were tasked with controlling a construct for all time as punishment.": "这种生物起源于Kwalish的古老设计，以多个大脑的形式出现，这些大脑被神奇地保存下来，共同操作一个新的机械身体。这些大脑彼此分享见解和知识，通常是从那些希望延长自己意识的生物身上取下来的，或者是那些作为惩罚而被要求永远控制一个构造物的生物。",

	"It has a speed of 20 feet.": "它的速度为20英尺。",
	"If this adventure is played as a sequel to {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}, this creature began as the brains in jars encountered in the Barrier Peaks. After constructing a new collective body from spare parts, the brains escaped (and now seek revenge against the characters if they did not aid the brains sufficiently during that adventure). The brains' collective goal in seeking the missing components is to be able to transfer themselves into the ultimate mechanical body—the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}.": "如果这次冒险是作为{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}的续集来玩的，这种生物开始是在屏障峰遇到的罐子里的大脑。在用零件构建了一个新的集体身体后，这些大脑逃了出来（如果在那次冒险中没有充分帮助这些大脑，他们现在会对这些人物进行报复）。大脑的集体目标是寻找缺失的部件，以便能够将自己转移到最终的机械身体--{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}。",
	"You can expand the characters' exploration of the Tomb of Horrors construction site in a number of ways.": "你可以通过多种方式扩展人物对恐怖之墓建筑工地的探索。",
	"Even villains have their hobbies—and for {@creature Moghadam|IMR}, that hobby is death traps. Any character who discusses traps with {@creature Moghadam|IMR} can impart to him a new deadly design—either using suitable roleplaying and player ingenuity, or a successful DC 16 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. Doing so gains {@creature Moghadam|IMR}'s favor and advantage on further ability checks made to negotiate with the artificer, as you determine.": "即使是恶棍也有他们的爱好--对{@creature Moghadam|IMR}来说，这个爱好就是死亡陷阱。任何与{@creature Moghadam|IMR}讨论过陷阱的角色都可以向他传授新的致命设计--要么使用合适的角色扮演和玩家的聪明才智，要么成功进行DC16魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查。这样做可以获得{@creature Moghadam|IMR}的好感，并在与工匠谈判的进一步能力检定中获得优势，具体由你决定。",
	"As an added element of danger and dilemma during the ceremony in the chapel ({@area area 14|093|x}), each time a character succeeds on a saving throw to resist the ceremony's power, one of the worshipers in the pews is overcome and transforms into black rock.": "在礼拜堂的仪式中，作为一个额外的危险和困境的元素（{@area area 14|093|x}），每当一个角色在抵抗仪式的力量时蓄力成功，就会有一个在座位上的崇拜者被征服并变成黑岩。",
	"If the black rocks from the chapel are brought to the sculptors, you might decide that they can help restore those victims to life using their superior mason's tools. Alternatively, the sculptors might want to incorporate these magic rocks into an even more impressive golem, helping to ensure their escape. Likewise, if taken to the Temple of Moloch, these rocks might be highly prized for the crafting of statues and homunculi.": "如果把小教堂里的黑色石头带给雕塑家，你可能会决定他们可以用他们优越的石匠工具帮助那些受害者恢复生命。另外，雕塑家们可能会想把这些神奇的石头融入到一个更令人印象深刻的巨石中，帮助确保他们逃脱。同样地，如果被带到摩洛神庙，这些石头可能会被高度重视，用于制作雕像和同形体。",

	"You might introduce different options for interacting with the statues in {@area area 24|136|x}, especially if combat breaks out there. For example, if the eidolon inhabits a statue of Zariel or Bel, the characters might gain advantage on attack rolls against that statue if they serve the archdevil's agent (or disadvantage on attack rolls against the statue of the competing agent's patron). Out of combat, if the characters are allied with {@creature Moghadam|IMR} and remove a hand and an eye from any statue, Vecna rewards them with some boon (advantage on attack rolls during the first round of their next fight, having a consumable magic item appear in the statue's remaining hand, and so forth).": "你可以引入不同的选项来与{@area area 24|136|x}的雕像互动，尤其是在那里发生战斗的时候。例如，如果Eidolon居住在Zariel或Bel的雕像中，如果角色为大恶魔的代理人服务，他们可能会在对该雕像的攻击卷中获得优势（或在对竞争代理人的守护者的雕像的攻击卷中处于劣势）。在战斗之外，如果人物与{@creature Moghadam|IMR}结盟，并从任何雕像上取下一只手和一只眼睛，Vecna就会奖励他们一些好处（在下一次战斗的第一轮中获得攻击卷的优势，在雕像剩下的手上出现一个可消耗的魔法物品，等等）。",
	"One of the chickens in {@area area 35|15f|x} might be one of {@creature Thessalar|IMR}'s experiments, such that it occasionally lays silver eggs (worth 10 gp) or even golden eggs (worth 20 gp).

	"The characters might need to travel back to a time when Keraptis first constructed his legendary dungeon (featured in {@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP}), and used components from the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad} to magically secure {@item Wave}, {@item Whelm}, and {@item Blackrazor} in place.

	"Seeing through the hags' illusions without touching them requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check. But a character who touches one of the hags does not automatically sense that the creature's form is false. The hags' clothing, their hair, and features such as Mother Stag's antlers are all real. Only by touching a hag's skin can a character detect a difference between the illusory form and the real creature beneath it—and the hags attempt to prevent such contact.": "在不触碰她们的情况下看穿女巫的幻象需要成功通过一次DC 20的智力检定({@skill Investigation})。但是触碰其中一位女巫的角色并不会自动感知到这个生物的形态是虚假的。女巫的衣服、她们的头发，以及像Mother Stag的鹿角这样的特征都是真实的。只有通过触碰女巫的皮肤，角色才能察觉到幻象形态和底下真实生物之间的差异——而女巫们会设法阻止这种接触。",
	"If the characters attack and destroy the hags, the cottage can contain a crude map indicating the location of the clock tower bridge if the characters are likely to seek out such a mysterious site on their own.

	"The three mothers offer to serve as guides, leading the characters safely through the woods to their original destination. But in exchange, they ask for assistance in defeating this evil unicorn.

	"The dryad-hags also lend each character a woven crown of willow branches—an uncommon magic item called a {@item crown of the forest|IMR}. They insist that the crowns be worn at all times for the characters' own safety, claiming (truthfully) that the crowns will allow the characters to see the sunbeam tripwires and step safely through them. However, the crowns also intensify the hags' illusion of themselves as dryads and Olitor as a satyr, make the unicorn {@creature Banrion|IMR} appear to be a fiendish, haggard beast, and make the fey in the unicorn's care appear as vicious kobolds.": "树精女巫还为每个角色提供了一顶柳树枝编织的王冠——一种名为{@item crown of the forest|IMR}的罕见魔法物品。她们坚持要求角色时刻佩戴这些王冠，声称（事实属实）这些王冠将使角色能够看到阳光绊索，并安全地穿越它们。然而，这些王冠也加强了女巫们将自己幻化为树精、将奥利托幻化为半人马的错觉，使得独角兽{@creature Banrion|IMR}看起来像是一个邪恶、憔悴的野兽，并使得独角兽照料的精灵看起来像凶恶的狡猾小妖。",
	"While wearing a crown, a character automatically fails any Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check made to see through an illusion.

	"The collapsed structure crosses the 100-foot-deep chasm and appears extremely unstable. ({@creature Banrion|IMR} can teleport across the chasm, but does so only rarely. Because she can teleport only once per day, she is wary of being stuck on the other side if the hags' servants are nearby.)

	"The rocky plateau beyond the chasm holds the crumbled shell of an ancient castle. {@creature Banrion|IMR} the unicorn makes her home here, along with a number of goodly fey who shelter in a network of tiny tunnels within the ruins.

	"The {@creature unicorn} {@creature Banrion|IMR} defends her home and its inhabitants with her life. If the characters threaten or attack her here, she fights to the finish, refusing to teleport away. But if the characters have peaceful intent (most likely because they saw through the dryad-hags' ruse, or they simply want to assess {@creature Banrion|IMR}'s nature themselves), they can approach unarmed and announcing themselves.

	"If the characters agree to fight the hags, {@creature Banrion|IMR} joins them. But she asks that before the fight, the characters help escort the fey living in the ruins across the bridge, then manipulate the fallen clock tower back to its standing position.

In this way, the characters discover the tower's controls if they have not already.": "如果角色们同意与女巫们战斗，{@creature Banrion|IMR} 会加入他们。但她要求在战斗前，角色们帮助护送废墟中的精灵穿过桥梁，然后将倒塌的钟楼重新竖立起来。这样可以防御性地封锁她的高原，以防女巫们占领。 (如果她存活下来，独角兽仍然可以穿越峡谷进行传送。) 通过这种方式，角色们可以发现塔楼的控制方式，如果他们还没有发现的话。",
	"If asked, {@creature Banrion|IMR} knows only that the clock tower was once part of an ancient city.

	"If the characters defeat the hags, {@creature Banrion|IMR} returns to prominence and drives the rest of the wicked fey out of the woods. Before the characters depart, she asks them to once more use the panel at the clock tower bridge, adjusting time back toward the past. Combined with her own magical influence, this allows the unicorn to separate the myconids from the trees, returning the woods to their former condition.": "如果角色们击败了女巫，{@creature Banrion|IMR}将重新占据主导地位，并驱赶其他邪恶的精灵离开树林。在角色们离开之前，她要求他们再次使用时钟塔桥上的面板，将时间调整回过去。再加上她自己的魔法影响，这使得独角兽能够将菌人从树木中分离，将树林恢复到以前的状态。",
	"With the hags defeated, {@creature Banrion|IMR} has no further need for the clock tower panel's magical power. She insists that the characters take the two components, both as a reward and as items worthy of magical study.

	"Regardless of whether the characters take the missing components, their activity in the woods is eventually noted by spies of the two agents, {@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR} and {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} (introduced in {@adventure chapter 2|IMR|2}).

It has since grown too large to return to the temple, and now serves as a kind of living demigod to the cultists and lizardfolk serving {@creature Thessalar|IMR}, who refer to it as the \"Child of Moloch.\"": "{@creature Thessalar|IMR}的怪物创造之一，{@creature thessalkraken|IMR}，被证明过于危险，无法安全处理，因此多年前被流放到这些洞穴中。它已经长到无法返回神庙，现在作为一种活着的半神存在，供给着仰仗{@creature Thessalar|IMR}的教徒和蜥蜴人，他们称之为“摩洛克之子”。",
	"Lizardfolk in service to {@creature Thessalar|IMR} are sent here to brave the waters and attempt to recover more gemstones from the bottom of the lake. When the characters arrive here, the bottom of the lake is littered with {@dice 1d10} rubies. Roll a {@dice d10} to determine the value of each ruby found—": "服务于{@creature Thessalar|IMR}的蜥蜴人被派遣到这里，冒险潜入水中，尝试从湖底找回更多的宝石。当角色们到达这里时，湖底散落着{@dice 1d10}颗红宝石。掷出一个{@dice d10}来确定每颗找到的红宝石的价值—",
	"The entire workshop is filled with a massive magical-mechanical device, worked on by a half-dozen servants. With no visible means to move it, the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad} must presumably have the power to teleport itself from place to place. It appears ancient, the style of its crafting unlike anything you've ever seen before. It features some sixty levers, forty dials, and twenty massive switches, as well as a booth large enough to hold four humans—but whether those humans would be the machine's operators or the targets for its magic is unknown.": "整个车间里摆满了一个庞大的魔法机械装置，由六个仆人操作。没有明显的移动方式，{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad} 可能具有自我传送的能力。它看起来古老，制作风格与你以往见过的任何东西都不同。它有大约六十个杠杆，四十个刻度盘，二十个巨大的开关，以及一个足够容纳四个人的小隔间——但这四个人是机器的操作者还是其魔法的目标，尚不得而知。",
	"When the components the characters collected are presented, the agent's assistants (six {@creature Cultist||cultists} in official-looking white lab coats) work quickly to install those components into the {@i Infernal Machine}. The mechanical guide that's accompanied the characters attaches itself to the machine, allowing it to serve as a command unit.": "当角色收集到的零件被呈现出来时，代理的助手们（穿着正式的白色实验室外套的六名{@creature Cultist||cultists}）迅速地将这些零件安装到{@i Infernal Machine}中。随同角色的机械向导附着在机器上，使其能够作为一个指挥单元。",
	"Another six {@creature Cultist||cultists} then appear with the agent's secret prisoner to finalize the programming.": "另外六名{@creature Cultist||cultists}随后出现，与特工的秘密囚犯一起完成程序设计。",
	"In response to any reaction or questions, the agent proudly explains how the partially functioning {@i Infernal Machine} was used to find and capture Lum the Mad, so that he could assist in restoring the machine to its primal state.": "作为回应任何反应或问题，特工自豪地解释部分运作的{@i Infernal Machine}是如何被用来找到并捕捉疯狂的卢姆(Lum the Mad)，以便他能帮助恢复机器到原始状态。",
	"The other agent arrives with a full complement of a dozen servants (use the {@creature cultist} stat block).": "另一位特工带来了一整队十二名仆人（使用 {@creature cultist} 统计数据表）。",
	"During the raid, both agents attempt to attune to the {@i Infernal Machine}. You can decide which one is successful or allow chance to decide (see \"Complications\" below), taking into account the actions of the characters if they support one agent or the other.": "在突袭过程中，两名特工都试图调谐到{@i Infernal Machine}。您可以决定哪一个成功，或者让机会决定（参见下文的“复杂情况”），考虑到角色的行动是否支持其中一名特工。",
	"If the characters failed to recover a significant number of components from either site in the past—and assuming you don't want to send them back—you can work that into this final showdown. Whichever agent the characters return to is disappointed in their progress, but comes up with an alternative plan. Knowing that the other agent might also have sent their own operatives back to collect the missing components, the characters' agent invites them to help break into the rival agent's workshop to steal those components from the rival's version of the {@i Infernal Machine}. Reverse the general setup of this section to have the characters on the side that breaks into the workshop. There, they see the rival agent holding Lum the Mad, and in the process of completing the {@i Infernal Machine}.": "如果角色们过去未能从任何一个地点恢复大量组件，并且假设你不想让他们返回，你可以将这一点融入到最终的对决中。无论角色们回到哪位特工那里，都会对他们的进展感到失望，但会提出另一个计划。知道另一位特工可能也派遣了自己的特工回去收集丢失的组件，角色们的特工邀请他们帮忙闯入对手特工的车间，从对手版本的{@i Infernal Machine}中偷取这些组件。颠倒这一部分的一般设置，让角色们站在闯入车间的一方。在那里，他们看到对手特工正在控制疯人卢姆，并且正在完成{@i Infernal Machine}的过程中。",
	"Lynx slays {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}. She cuts off his bear paw, promising to turn it into her personal backscratcher.": "猞猁杀死了{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}。她砍下了他的熊掌，承诺把它变成她的个人挠背器。",
	"Both Lynx and {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} manage to slay one another simultaneously.": "猞猁和{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}同时互相击杀。",
	"The conflict between the hags and the unicorn {@creature Banrion|IMR} can be complicated or augmented in a number of ways.": "{@creature Banrion|IMR}与独角兽之间的冲突可以通过多种方式变得复杂或加剧。",
	"The hags' cottage is built from three trees entwined together. These trees might contain the three true dryads whose appearances the hags have stolen for their own use, and who have been enslaved by the hags to help with their corrupt gardening. If the characters treat with {@creature Banrion|IMR}, the unicorn asks them to help free the dryads to set the woods back to order.": "这些女巫的小屋是由三棵树交织在一起建造的。这些树可能包含了三位真正的树精，她们的外表被女巫偷走，被奴役来帮助她们腐化的园艺。如果角色与{@creature Banrion|IMR}交涉，独角兽会要求他们帮助释放树精，让森林恢复秩序。",
	"Instead of the hags being disguised as goodly dryads, you might instead choose to reverse the scenario. The Three Mothers might really be dryads in need of help, with {@creature Banrion|IMR} the unicorn an evil creature that must be defeated to save the woods. The unicorn might even be using its dark magic to cause the dryads to appear as hags.": "与其让女巫伪装成善良的树精，你可以选择颠倒情况。三位母亲可能真的是需要帮助的树精，在{@creature Banrion|IMR}独角兽可能是一个邪恶生物，必须被打败以拯救森林。这只独角兽甚至可能正在利用它的黑暗魔法让树精看起来像女巫。",
	"If the characters initially make an aggressive approach toward {@creature Banrion|IMR} (whether because the hags have fooled them or because the unicorn is evil), you can make the fight tougher by having the unicorn appear while the characters are attempting to cross the clock tower bridge. While fighting on the bridge, {@creature Banrion|IMR} looks to knock characters off the tower into the chasm below, or even to try to collapse the tower under the characters while she teleports away.": "如果角色最初对{@creature Banrion|IMR}采取了攻击性的态度（无论是因为女巫们愚弄了他们还是因为独角兽是邪恶的），你可以让战斗变得更加艰难，让独角兽在角色试图穿过钟楼桥时出现。在桥上战斗时，{@creature Banrion|IMR}试图击倒角色，使他们掉落到下面的深渊中，甚至试图在瞬间传送后让塔楼倒塌在角色身上。",
	"As written, the mechanical guides can safely teleport the characters to and from the specific adventure locations. If it fits with your campaign, you might opt to allow teleportation to other locations in time and space with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. A failed check causes the characters to be misdirected physically or temporally, as you determine. If the characters claim any missing components of the {@i Infernal Machine}, those components can be added to the mechanical guide, providing a +2 bonus to this check per component.": "按照所写的内容，机械向导可以安全地将角色传送到特定的冒险地点并从中传送出来。如果符合你的战役设定，你可以选择允许通过成功的DC 20智力检定（{@skill Arcana}）将角色传送到时间和空间中的其他位置。检定失败会导致角色在物理或时间上被错误引导，具体效果由你决定。如果角色声称缺少{@i Infernal Machine}的任何组件，这些组件可以被添加到机械向导中，每个组件提供+2的检定加值。",
	"You might decide that neither agent would ever allow the components they already possess to leave their sight, or that the characters are the first ones to have come across any missing components. If so, Lynx's guide is powered by a dangerous combination of living {@spell teleport} and {@spell time stop} spells, and might malfunction as you see fit. {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}'s guide is a captured quarut (an inevitable that seeks to uphold the laws of space and time), and which is forced to use its powers as Ursas demands. Though the quarut is programmed to prevent it from revealing its plight outright, it might provide clues during the adventure that all is not as it seems.": "你可能决定，两位特工都绝不会让他们已经拥有的组件离开视线，或者这些角色是第一个发现任何缺失组件的人。如果是这样，Lynx的向导由危险的活体{@spell teleport}和{@spell time stop}咒语的组合驱动，可能会出现故障，您可以自行决定。{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}的向导是一只被俘虏的夸鲁特（一种旨在维护时空法则的必然存在），被迫使用其力量以满足乌尔萨的要求。虽然夸鲁特被程序化阻止直接透露其困境，但在冒险中可能会提供线索，表明一切并非表面所见。",
	"While little is known of Daoud, his lanthorn was part of the treasure to be recovered in the AD&D adventure module {@i Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth}. Light cast through the different faces of the lanthorn created different magical effects, which the lanthorn fueled with crushed gemstones.": "虽然对Daoud的了解甚少，但他的灯笼是AD&D冒险模组{@i Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth}中要恢复的宝藏的一部分。透过灯笼的不同面投射的光会产生不同的魔法效果，而灯笼则通过碎宝石提供能量。",
	"As written, the sculptors in the Tomb of Horrors are eager to escape but the muralists are loyal to {@creature Moghadam|IMR}. However, you might decide that the muralists have their own reasons to flee servitude, and have secured a set of {@item claws of the umber hulk|PotA} (see {@adventure appendix C|IMR|8}) to do so. They might also look for the characters' help to escape, using the claws to dig a secret tunnel beneath their chambers in {@area area 9|07d|x}—and potentially intersecting with the umber hulks' excavations.": "如原文所述，墓室中的雕塑家渴望逃脱，但壁画家忠于{@creature Moghadam|IMR}。然而，你可以决定壁画家有他们自己的逃离奴役的理由，并已经获得了一套{@item claws of the umber hulk|PotA}（见{@adventure appendix C|IMR|8}）来实现这一目的。他们可能会寻求角色的帮助来逃脱，利用爪子在他们的房间下挖掘一个秘密通道，通往{@area area 9|07d|x}——可能会与土色巨蟹的挖掘活动相交。",
	"The fiery rift of area 16 allows {@creature Tarnhem|IMR} to return to the Abyss. But depending on the setup of your campaign (and particularly if you are playing through {@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA}), you might instead have this rift lead to the Nine Hells. There, {@creature Tarnhem|IMR} joins the demonic horde taking part in the Blood War.": "16区域的烈焰裂缝允许{@creature Tarnhem|IMR}返回深渊。但根据你的战役设置（尤其是如果你正在玩{@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA}），你可能会让这个裂缝通往九层地狱。在那里，{@creature Tarnhem|IMR}加入了参与血战的恶魔军团。",
	"If the characters later travel through Avernus, they might encounter {@creature Tarnhem|IMR} there—with his reaction to them depending on their interactions at the tomb.": "如果角色们后来穿越到阿弗尼斯，他们可能会在那里遇到{@creature Tarnhem|IMR}—他对他们的反应取决于他们在墓穴中的互动。",
	"Considering the variety of laboratory creatures residing in the temple, its hallways might also be populated by roving packs of wild, escaped {@creature tressym|BGDIA}. These flying cats follow and spy on the characters, but might help lead them to various locations (such as the secret door outside {@area area 38|16b|x}) if treated well. The tressym despise {@creature Barbatos|IMR}'s {@creature hell hound} ({@area areas 12|102|x} and {@area 13|106|x}), and actively aid any effort to destroy it.": "考虑到寺庙中居住的各种实验室生物，其走廊上也可能会有漫游的野生逃脱者群体。这些飞猫会跟踪并监视角色，但如果受到善待，它们可能会帮助引导他们到达各个地点（比如外面的秘密门{@area area 38|16b|x}）。天猫魔猫厌恶{@creature Barbatos|IMR}的{@creature hell hound}（{@area areas 12|102|x}和{@area 13|106|x}），并积极帮助任何摧毁它的努力。",
	"When the characters deliver the missing components to their chosen agent and the other agent launches a raid, that raid is led by a second artifact that the agent has been constructing—the {@i Mighty Servant of Leuk-O}. Alternatively, if Kwalish is involved, he might build or upgrade a suit of {@i powered armor} (from {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}) to become the {@i Mighty Servant of Leuk-O}. The characters can then use that artifact (with features determined by you) to counter the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}.": "当角色们将缺失的组件交给他们选择的代理人时，另一位代理人发起了一次突袭，这次突袭由代理人一直在制造的第二件神器——{@i Mighty Servant of Leuk-O}，来领导。或者，如果卡维利什参与其中，他可能会建造或升级一套{@i powered armor}（来自{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}）成为{@i Mighty Servant of Leuk-O}。角色们随后可以使用该神器（具体特性由您决定）来对抗{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}。",
	"You can turn this adventure into an entire campaign by adding additional locations containing more missing components of the {@i Infernal Machine}. Just as the Tomb of Horrors was repurposed here, you might similarly repurpose other adventures from D&D history or your previous campaigns, manipulating their time lines to create alternative scenarios.": "你可以通过添加更多包含{@i Infernal Machine}更多缺失组件的地点，将这次冒险扩展成一个完整的战役。就像这里重新利用了恐怖之墓一样，你也可以类似地重新利用D&D历史上的其他冒险或你以前的战役，操纵它们的时间线来创造替代情节。",
	"If you are playing this adventure alongside {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}, {@adventure White Plume Mountain|TftYP-WPM} offers a number of connections to that adventure's guides. Ctenmiir the vampire once haunted White Plume Mountain, while Mary Greymalkin's former tutor, the witch Thingizzard, dwelled nearby.": "如果你与{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}一起玩这个冒险，{@adventure White Plume Mountain|TftYP-WPM}提供了一些与那个冒险向导的联系。吸血鬼Ctenmiir曾经在白羽山出没，而玛丽·格雷马尔金的前导师，女巫辛吉扎德，就住在附近。",
	"During the time frame in which the characters visit the Tomb of Horrors, Acererak is still a mortal human spellcaster—albeit an incredibly evil and powerful one. You can play him as an {@creature archmage}—or for higher-level parties, use his stat block from {@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA}, but without his undead traits, his Rejuvenation and Turn Resistance traits, and his Disrupt Life legendary action. Acererak does not reside in the Tomb of Horrors at the time the characters travel there in chapter 3, but he might appear if its construction is hindered. He is keen on preventing characters from utterly destroying the tomb, but might grace them with an audience if they look as though they could prove useful to furthering his plans.": "在角色们参观恐怖之墓时，阿塞拉克仍然是一个凡人法术施法者，尽管是一个极其邪恶和强大的人。你可以将他玩成一个{@creature archmage}，或者对于高级别的队伍，使用他在{@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA}中的属性块，但不包括他的不死特征、他的重生和抗转特征，以及他的破坏生命传奇动作。阿塞拉克并不居住在恐怖之墓中，当角色们在第3章前往那里时，但如果其建造受到阻碍，他可能会出现。他热衷于阻止角色们彻底摧毁墓室，但如果他们看起来可能对推动他的计划有用，他可能会赐予他们一次会面。",
	"You are instantly teleported to and confined within either the Tomb of Horrors (in {@area area 7|076|x}) or the Temple of Moloch (in {@area area 10|081|x}) as the DM determines. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You draw no more cards.": "你会被立即传送到并被困在DM确定的{@area area 7|076|x}的恐怖之墓或{@area area 10|081|x}的摩洛克神殿中。你所穿戴和携带的一切都会留在你消失时所占据的空间里。你不会再抽取更多的牌。",
	"A powerful artificer ({@creature Moghadam|IMR} or {@creature Thessalar|IMR}, at the DM's determination) becomes your enemy. The artificer seeks your ruin, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you.": "一位强大的制造师（{@creature Moghadam|IMR}或{@creature Thessalar|IMR}，由DM决定）成为了你的敌人。这位制造师追求毁灭你，享受你的痛苦，然后才试图杀死你。",
	"You gain the service of one of the servants of your chosen agent (see {@adventure chapter 2|IMR|2}), who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The NPC serves you loyally for the duration of the adventure, understanding that the fates have drawn them to you. However, they remain violently opposed to any servants of the opposing agent. You control this character.": "你获得你选择的代理人（见{@adventure chapter 2|IMR|2}）之一的仆人的服务，该仆人出现在你选择的距离不超过30英尺的空间内。NPC会忠诚地为你效劳，直到冒险结束，明白命运将他们带到你身边。然而，他们会对任何来自对立代理人的仆人保持激烈的敌意。你控制这个角色。",
	"This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and held within a soul gem in the Temple of Moloch (with the gemsmith in {@area area 31|151|x}). While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is {@condition incapacitated}. {@spell Divination}, {@spell contact other plane}, or a similar spell of 4th level or higher reveals the location of the soul gem. You draw no more cards.": "这张黑卡预示着灾难。你的灵魂被抽离出身体，并被困在莫洛克神殿的灵魂宝石中（与{@area area 31|151|x}的宝石匠一起）。当你的灵魂被困在这种方式下时，你的身体是{@condition incapacitated}。{@spell Divination}，{@spell contact other plane}，或者一个类似的4级或更高级别的法术会揭示灵魂宝石的位置。你不再抽取更多的卡。",
	"This lawful evil male human {@creature archmage} is no longer at the Tomb of Horrors, but contributed to the construction in his own way. Acererak hired Tuerny to install magical technology obtained from the Barrier Peaks into the tomb (including the missing components), which now hold {@creature Tarnhem|IMR} imprisoned here and drain his life force. Since leaving the tomb, Tuerny has used what he learned in crafting {@creature Tarnhem|IMR}'s prison to create the first of his fabled {@item Iron Flask||iron flasks}]. If the characters choose to stay in the time frame of the under-construction tomb, they might find a map leading to Tuerny's fortress.": "这位人类男性{@creature archmage}是一位秩序邪恶的角色，他已经离开了《恐怖之墓》，但以自己的方式为其建造做出了贡献。阿瑟拉克雇佣了图尔尼（Tuerny）将从屏障峰获得的魔法技术安装到墓穴中（包括缺失的部件），这些技术现在囚禁着{@creature Tarnhem|IMR}并吸取他的生命力。离开墓穴后，图尔尼利用他在打造{@creature Tarnhem|IMR}的监狱中学到的知识，创造了他传说中的第一个{@item Iron Flask||iron flasks}]. 如果角色选择留在建造中的墓穴时间线中，他们可能会找到一张通往图尔尼堡垒的地图。",
	"This chapter details new poisons, spells, and magic items that appear in the adventure—including the legendary artifact {@i The Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}.": "这一章详细介绍了在冒险中出现的新毒药、法术和魔法物品，包括传奇神器{@i The Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}。",
