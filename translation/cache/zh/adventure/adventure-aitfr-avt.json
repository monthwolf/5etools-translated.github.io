	"Decades ago, a powerful wizard from a distant plane of existence came to the Sword Coast as an explorer. Here she adventured as an explorer, toiled in study, and eventually departed with her young son, back to their home plane of Ravnica. She was called Sylvene, and she left behind memories of beloved allies she met and befriended in the lands of the Sword Coast. Many of those memories were celebrated and commemorated with the construction of a grand crypt in a verdant land—where she hid valuable treasures. Now, those treasures attract not only adventures but the attention of her grandson, Tyreus, whose greed for power knows no bounds.": "几十年前，一位来自遥远位面的强大巫师作为一名探险家来到了剑海岸。在这里，她以探险家的身份进行冒险，在研究中辛勤劳作，最终和她的小儿子一起离开，回到了他们的家乡拉夫尼卡位面。她被称为希尔维尼，她留下了关于她在剑海岸的土地上遇到和结识的心爱盟友的记忆。其中许多记忆被庆祝和纪念，在一片青翠的土地上建造了一个宏伟的墓穴--她把宝贵的宝藏藏在那里。现在，这些宝藏不仅吸引了冒险，还吸引了她的孙子提瑞斯的注意，他对权力的贪婪是无止境的。",

	"This adventure involves a recurring villain named Tyreus. More about his plans and powers can be discovered in future adventures. If you prefer not to wait, or if you want to substitute another villain in for ours, you can adapt this adventure to refer to a villainous NPC of your own.": "这次冒险涉及到一个反复出现的反派，名叫泰鲁斯。更多关于他的计划和能力可以在未来的冒险中发现。如果你不愿意等待，或者你想用另一个反派来代替我们的反派，你可以改编这个冒险来指代你自己的反派NPC。",
	"By combining the immediacy of the players' choices with the mysterious histories and ambitions of key NPCs, this scenario explores themes of secrecy, hindsight, and loss. Future adventures in this series expand on other themes, to explore both the origins of these situations and the consequences of the players' choices along the way.": "通过将玩家的选择的直接性与关键NPC的神秘历史和野心相结合，这个场景探讨了秘密、事后诸葛亮和损失的主题。这个系列的未来冒险将扩展到其他主题，以探索这些情况的起源和玩家一路走来的选择的后果。",
	"A powerful mage is at work enacting a villainous plan near the Sword Coast. He is a trespasser from another plane. He is here in pursuit of legends and lore, in the footsteps of forebears who came here long ago. He is called Tyreus, though few here know him by name.": "一个强大的法师正在工作，在剑海岸附近制定一个反派计划。他是一个来自另一个位面的入侵者。他在这里追寻传奇和传说，追寻很久以前来到这里的先人的足迹。他被称为提瑞斯，尽管这里很少有人知道他的名字。",
	"Tyreus sought out the Wizard's Barrow (prior to the adventure In Scarlet Flames) after discovering a reference to it in a book that cited his grandmother, Sylvene. He tore into the Wizard's Barrow while looking for an arcane secret that might make him powerful—and worthy of his own pride—then had his minions burn the barrow's library in his wake. Tyreus found what he was looking for: a planar key that took him to a secret demiplane refuge Sylvene had created decades before. There Tyreus plundered more books (prior to the adventure in The Hidden Page), in hopes of discovering how Sylvene had created her demiplane.": "泰勒斯在一本引用他祖母希尔维尼的书中发现了关于巫师之丘的参考资料后，找到了巫师之丘（在《猩红的火焰》的冒险之前）。他撕毁了巫师墓穴，同时寻找一个可能使他强大的奥秘--值得他自己骄傲的奥秘--然后让他的部下在他之后烧毁了墓穴的图书馆。泰勒斯找到了他要找的东西：一把平面钥匙，把他带到了希尔维尼几十年前创造的一个秘密半平面避难所。在那里，泰勒斯掠夺了更多的书籍（在《隐藏的一页》的冒险之前），希望能发现希尔维尼是如何创造她的半位面的。",
	"Now he's found what he was looking for.": "现在他找到了他所寻找的东西。",
	"Tyreus has been busy. This might not all become known to the characters in this adventure but can be useful for you to know when portraying Tyreus: he's been searching for the hiding place of Sylvene's unused artifacts, called keystones of creation. In her diaries and journals, he found the answers he sought and the sigils he needed to access a teleportation circle in her final secret location. Sylvene buried her keystones of creation with the man she loved, Tyreus's grandfather. Years later, she was buried there, too.": "Tyreus一直很忙。这可能不会全部为这次冒险中的人物所知晓，但在扮演泰瑞丝时可以让你知道：他一直在寻找希尔维尼未使用的神器的藏身之处，这些神器被称为创造的关键石块。在她的日记和日志中，他找到了他所寻求的答案和他所需要的符号，以进入她最后的秘密地点的一个传送圈。希尔维尼将她的创造之钥与她所爱的人--泰勒斯的祖父埋在一起。多年以后，她也被埋在了那里。",
	"Bent on recovering the keystones for his own use, Tyreus has ventured to Sylvene's tomb, recovered the artifacts, and set traps to harrow whoever ventures to the tomb next. (And that almost certainly means the characters.)": "泰勒斯一心想要找回钥匙石为自己所用，他冒险去了希尔维尼的坟墓，找回了文物，并设置了陷阱来骚扰接下来冒险去坟墓的人。(而这几乎可以肯定是指人物。）",
	"Sylvene was a wizard of the distant city-world of Ravnica who came to Faerûn to explore the possibilities of magic across the multiverse. During her time in the Realms, she met and fell in love with a human named Waltarn Everlake, a shepherd from the village of Secomber, on the verge of the High Moors. He left his mundane life to travel with Sylvene and become an adventurer, but he didn't get very far. While exploring the High Moor in pursuit of an artifact called the Stone of Creation, Waltarn perished.": "西尔维尼是一位来自遥远的拉夫尼卡城市世界的巫师，她来到法鲁恩探索整个多元宇宙的魔法的可能性。在她的王国里，她遇到并爱上了一个叫Waltarn Everlake的人类，一个来自高沼泽边缘的Secomber村的牧羊人。他离开了平凡的生活，与希尔维尼一起旅行，成为一名冒险家，但他并没有走得很远。在探索高沼泽地，追寻一件名为 \"创造之石 \"的神器时，华塔恩殒命。",
	"He was interred in a lavish addition to his familial tomb, created by the only survivors of his adventuring party: Sylvene and a dwarven fighter called Artura Dwaircalis. They designed Waltarn's crypt to be accessible by teleportation circle in later years, so Sylvene might eventually be buried next to him.": "他被安葬在他家族坟墓的一个奢华的附加物中，由他的冒险队伍中唯一的幸存者创建。希尔维尼和一个叫阿图拉-德瓦卡利斯的矮人战士。他们把华塔恩的墓穴设计成在以后的日子里可以通过传送圈进入，所以希尔维尼最终可能会被埋在他身边。",
	"Sylvene and Artura told almost no one else, but the expansion they built into the tombs was also created to house a treasure they plundered from the High Moors during the very adventure that got Waltarn killed: keystones of creation.": "西尔维尼和阿图拉几乎没有告诉其他人，但他们在墓穴中建造的扩建部分也是为了存放他们在冒险中从高等摩尔人那里掠夺来的宝物，而这一冒险正是让沃坦恩被杀的：创造的关键石块。",
	"The adventure is set in motion when the adventurers learn where they can find the tomb of Sylvene and Waltarn and why it is important to get inside. The adventure truly begins when they arrive at the tomb's riverside sepulcher. Getting inside and exploring the site makes up the heart of the scenario, during which the adventurers face several monsters and traps. Their venture likely culminates in a meeting with Tyreus himself—or what seems to be him. Tyreus has prepared much of the crypt as a trap to thin the ranks of adventurers who might oppose him, lording over the tomb through an illusory manifestation. In the end, the adventurers likely learn what Tyreus has stolen from the tomb—powerful fragments of an artifact called the Stone of Creation—and get a sense of his heartless plans for the future.": "当冒险家们了解到在哪里可以找到西尔维尼和华塔恩的坟墓，以及为什么要进入坟墓时，冒险就开始了。当他们到达古墓的河边墓室时，冒险才真正开始。进入墓穴和探索墓穴是整个剧情的核心，在这个过程中，冒险者会面对一些怪物和陷阱。他们的冒险很可能在与泰鲁斯本人--或者看似是他的人--会面时达到高潮。泰勒斯将墓室的大部分地方准备成一个陷阱，以削弱可能反对他的冒险者的队伍，并通过一个虚幻的表现形式来统治这个坟墓。最后，冒险者们可能会知道泰勒斯从坟墓里偷了什么--一种叫做 \"创造之石 \"的神器的强大碎片，并了解到他对未来的无情计划。",
	"How the scenario ends is up the adventurers, but they may well escape with their own piece of the Stone, called a chip of creation.": "场景如何结束由冒险者决定，但他们很可能带着他们自己的那块石头，即所谓的创造芯片，逃之夭夭。",
	"The adventurers can become involved in this scenario in several ways, whether they're continuing along from previous scenarios or entering into the fray with this one.": "冒险家们可以通过多种方式参与到这个场景中来，不管他们是继续以前的场景，还是进入这个场景的战场。",
	"Adventurers looking into the origins and history of Sylvene's prior adventures—or dealing with the fallout of their own—attract the attention of Durow Dwaircalis, a dwarven veteran who has retired from the adventuring business and become a pacifist. He is the brother of Artura, who adventured with Sylvene and helped to build her tomb. Durow explains that Artura is gone on some adventure but word is spreading about Tyreus gaining power and growing careless. Durow is worried about Sylvene's secret tomb and cannot protect it himself.": "探究希尔维妮之前冒险的起源和历史的冒险者，或者处理他们自己的后果的冒险者，吸引了杜罗-德瓦卡利斯的注意，他是一个矮人老兵，已经从冒险事业中退休，成为一个和平主义者。他是阿图拉的兄弟，阿图拉曾与希尔维尼一起冒险，并帮助她建造了坟墓。杜罗解释说，阿图拉去冒险了，但关于泰勒斯获得权力和越来越粗心的消息正在传开。杜罗很担心西尔维尼的秘密坟墓，而自己又不能保护它。",
	"(In truth, Durow is the victim of a {@spell modify memory} spell cast by Tyreus, who \"confessed\" his plans for Sylvene's tomb to Durow as a means of flushing out rivals and other enemies. Tyreus has already been to Sylvene's tomb.)": "(事实上，杜罗是泰鲁斯施展的{@spell modify memory}法术的受害者，泰鲁斯向杜罗 \"坦白 \"了他对希尔维尼之墓的计划，以此来赶走对手和其他敌人。Tyreus已经去过Sylvene的坟墓了）。",
	"If the characters have not played prior adventures in this series, they might be asked or hired to find and access Sylvene's tomb by a sage or scholar who has worked with other adventurers in the aftermath of the Wizard's Barrow discovery. Perhaps that sage has even been approached by Durow but is unwilling or unable to go to the High Moors himself. The sage wants to know the fate of the mysterious wizard, Sylvene, and any knowledge she had gathered about the Stone of Creation. The adventurers are his agents in the field.": "如果角色没有玩过这个系列的早期冒险，他们可能会被一个在发现巫师之丘后与其他冒险者合作的圣人或学者要求或雇佣去寻找和进入希尔维尼的坟墓。也许那个圣人甚至已经被杜罗找去了，但他不愿意或不能亲自去高等摩尔。贤者想知道神秘的巫师希尔维尼的命运，以及她收集到的关于创造之石的任何知识。冒险家们是他在这个领域的代理人。",
	"The adventure begins when the adventurers reach the area near the sepulcher, about 40 miles east of the village of Secomber. There the south branch of the Delimbiyr (sometimes called Hark River) runs through reedy marshlands along the feet of cliffs and steep hills that rise to form the High Moors' plateau.": "当冒险者到达墓穴附近的地区时，冒险就开始了，该地区位于塞康伯村以东约40英里处。在那里，德林拜尔河的南支（有时称为哈克河）沿着悬崖和陡峭的山丘脚下流过长满芦苇的沼泽地，这些山丘升起后形成了高地摩尔的高原。",
	"The place they seek is a shrine and once-beautiful mausoleum built by a few wealthy families from Secomber. It is set into a cliff on the south side of the river. Designed to be rustic and remote, the site has fallen into severe disrepair as a result of its distance from Secomber. Many of the families whose ancestors were interred here have since taken their wealth to Waterdeep and never returned. After visitors stopped arriving to remember those buried here, no one came to combat the weather and the waters as they took their toll.": "他们寻找的地方是一个神殿和曾经美丽的陵墓，由塞康伯的几个富有的家庭建造。它被镶嵌在河的南侧的悬崖上。陵墓设计得古朴而偏僻，由于远离塞孔伯，这里已经陷入严重的失修状态。许多祖先被安葬在这里的家庭后来都把他们的财富带到了沃特德普，再也没有回来。在游客们不再前来缅怀埋葬在这里的人之后，没有人来对抗天气和水的侵蚀。",
	"Only one of the participating families stayed in Secomber but fell on hard times decades ago and gradually came to forget their forebears. Their family name was Everlake. The last of them died of old age within the past twenty years.": "在参与的家庭中，只有一个家庭留在了塞孔伯，但几十年前就陷入了困境，并逐渐忘记了他们的祖先。他们的姓氏是Everlake。他们中的最后一个人在过去20年里因年老而去世。",
	"The land immediately around the sepulcher is unkempt, avoided even by the goats and sheep of the few shepherds in the region. Trees are rare here. Stray boulders and scrub plants abound.": "紧挨着墓穴的土地是不整洁的，甚至连该地区少数牧人的山羊和绵羊都要避开。这里的树木很稀少。流浪的巨石和灌丛植物比比皆是。",
	"Cold, windswept rain billows across the reeds and grasses uphill from the river. Water runs off the hills above in muddy streams, bringing dead leaves and clumps of grasses into damp heaps. A single, dead tree bends in the wind, like a bony hand grasping at the sky.": "寒冷的风吹雨打在河边上坡的芦苇和草丛中。水从上面的山丘上流下，形成泥泞的溪流，把枯叶和草丛带到潮湿的堆里。一棵棵枯树在风中弯曲，像一只只骨瘦如柴的手抓着天空。",
	"The grassy ground rises up gradually from the riverbank to where the sepulcher is built into the base of a scrabbly 20-foot cliff. Bits of red granite jut from the cliff and the ground, revealed over long years by the river and the rain. Across the river, wide meadows and wild hedges feed the local sheep.": "长满草的地面从河岸逐渐上升到墓穴建在一个20英尺高的悬崖底部的地方。红色花岗岩的碎片从悬崖和地面上突出来，在漫长的岁月里被河流和雨水冲刷出来。河对岸，宽阔的草地和野生树篱喂养着当地的绵羊。",
	"The will-o'-wisps can make any encounter here more difficult, so use them sparingly. These creatures raise the stakes for any adventurer who drops to 0 hit points, but raising the stakes isn't always required. These particular will-o'-wisps are also selfish and cowardly, they seldom work together. And these aren't their graves they're defending. They simply like the ambiance of a rotten sepulcher.": "巫师会使这里的任何遭遇变得更加困难，所以要少用它们。这些生物提高了任何下降到0命中率的冒险者的赌注，但提高赌注并不总是需要的。这些特殊的巫师也很自私和懦弱，他们很少一起工作。而且他们要保卫的不是他们的坟墓。他们只是喜欢腐烂的墓穴的氛围。",
	"The grounds around the sepulcher are flooded by rain and overflow from the nearby river. Mud and leaves form clogs in the reeds, trapping water in a rough pond surrounded by cattails. The water looks to have partly flooded the sepulcher itself through a few cracks in the facade wide enough to squeeze through.": "墓穴周围的地面被雨水和附近河流的溢流淹没。泥土和树叶在芦苇丛中形成堵塞，将水困在一个由香蒲环绕的粗糙池塘中。水看起来已经部分淹没了墓穴本身，通过外墙的几条足以挤进去的裂缝。",
	"The pond is about 4 feet deep. Its bottom is a mix of sucking mud and fallen rocks.": "这个池塘大约有4英尺深。其底部是吸泥和落石的混合体。",
	"The masonry of the structure's face is eroding from both sides, thanks to the water feature in area 4 and the soaked earth here. Small and Medium-sized creatures can move through the largest crack in the facade; a Large creature can squeeze through it.": "由于第4区的水景和这里浸泡的泥土，结构面的砖石正从两边被侵蚀。小型和中型生物可以通过外墙的最大裂缝移动；大型生物可以挤过去。",
	"A stone arch leans in the tall grass here where the slab it on which it once stood has been overwhelmed. The arch frames a small altar and shelf built into a waisthigh alcove in the front of the sepulcher. The top of the altar is a stone bowl for offerings, flanked by two stone settings meant to hold candles or oil for burning.": "在这里，一个石拱门倚在高高的草丛中，它曾经所在的石板已经被压倒了。拱门框住了一个小祭坛和架子，架子建在墓穴前面的腰部凹处。祭坛的顶部是一个供奉的石碗，两边是两个石架，用来放置燃烧用的蜡烛或油。",
	"This ritual shrine was intended as a way to allow visitors to honor the interred even when the sepulcher was sealed. The fact that the shrine has not been used in years has emboldened the will-o'wisps in the surrounding area.": "这个仪式性的神龛是为了让游客在墓穴被封存的情况下也能纪念被埋葬的人。祠堂多年未被使用的事实，使周围地区的鬼魂更加胆大妄为。",
	"A successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check recalls prayers and other customary rites suitable for the shrine, all of which involve lighting candles or lamp oil, or casting light. If the shrine is lit, it attracts all remaining will-o'-wisps at the sepulcher. They arrive angry, ready to attack, and do not leave until the shrine is darkened or they are destroyed.": "成功通过DC10智力（{@skill Religion}）检查，就能回忆起适合神龛的祈祷和其他习俗仪式，所有这些都涉及到点燃蜡烛或灯油，或投射光。如果神龛被点燃，它就会吸引墓穴里所有剩余的巫师。它们愤怒地来到这里，准备攻击，直到神龛变暗或它们被消灭才会离开。",
	"The door to the mausoleum beyond hasn't been used in a long time. Caked mud and rusted hinges hold the iron gate fast. Behind that, a stone slab with two metal loops set into it, for ropes, stands firm—more of a seal than a door.": "通往陵墓外的门已经很久没有使用了。剥落的泥土和生锈的铰链将铁门牢牢固定。在门后，一块石板上镶嵌着两个金属环，用来拴住绳索，稳稳地站在那里，与其说是门，不如说是封条。",
	"The names of the mausoleum's three founding families are carved above the entrance: Springbank, Dalmoor, and Everlake.": "陵墓的三个创始家族的名字被雕刻在入口处的上方。Springbank、Dalmoor和Everlake。",
	"Loudly opening the iron gate or unsealing the stone slab likely alerts all creatures in the mausoleum as far as area 7.": "大声地打开铁门或解开石板的封印，很可能会惊动陵墓中所有的生物，直到第7区。",
	"The first areas inside the mausoleum are open to each other and can quickly become a single, harrowing encounter.": "陵墓内的第一个区域是相互开放的，很快就会成为一个单一的、令人痛苦的遭遇。",
	"The last humanoid trespassers at this site—before the adventurers—were here to loot the place. Four human grave-robbers swam in through the facade a few years ago and, after ransacking area 5, attracted the attention of a shambling mound that often stalks this area. It is likely still here when the adventurers intrude. Its hulking mass includes the bones of the grave-robbers now.": "在冒险者之前，这个地方的最后一批人形闯入者是来这里抢劫的。几年前，四个人类盗墓者从门面游了进来，在洗劫了5号区域后，引起了一个经常在这个区域徘徊的小土丘的注意。当冒险者闯入时，它可能还在这里。它庞大的身躯包括现在盗墓者的骨头。",
	"Bound to the shambler and the bones within it is a wraith formed from the hateful greed of the lead grave-robber. The wraith haunts its grave, which is essentially inside the shambling mound. The wraith doesn't attack the shambler; it goes where the shambler goes.": "捆绑在碎石堆和其中的骨头上的是一个由带头的盗墓者的可恨贪婪形成的幽灵。裹尸人在它的坟墓里出没，而坟墓基本上就在晃动的土丘里。裹尸人不攻击盗墓者；它去盗墓者所去的地方。",
	"The other three grave-robbers now haunt this place as three specters under the wraith's command. They tend to gather in area 6, near the treasures they collected.": "另外三个盗墓者现在作为三个幽灵在这个地方出没，他们在巫师的指挥下。他们往往聚集在6号区域，靠近他们收集的财宝。",
	"The tombs demonstrate fine designs and quality work, all allowed to rot through neglect.": "这些墓葬展示了精美的设计和高质量的工作，都被允许因疏忽而腐烂。",
	"The interior spaces here were meant for somber memorials and funeral services. The stonework was well done but has been slowly sinking and sagging in mud over decades. The marble floors and carved walls are no longer plumb but are not dangerous.": "这里的内部空间是为阴沉的纪念馆和葬礼服务准备的。石头工程做得很好，但几十年来一直在泥土中慢慢下沉和下陷。大理石地板和雕刻的墙壁已经不再平直，但并不危险。",
	"Most ceilings throughout the tombs are arched to a height of 8 feet. Many are painted with murals of cloudy-blue or starry-night skies, flaking and moldy now.": "整个墓室的天花板大多是拱形的，高度为8英尺。许多壁画上都绘有云蓝色或星夜的天空，现在已经剥落和发霉了。",
	"No natural light makes it into the mausoleum, except for a bit of overcast spill lighting in area 4. Every chamber has iron sconces for torches or lanterns, but no torches or lanterns remain.": "没有自然光进入陵墓，除了4号区域有一点阴天的溢出照明。每个房间都有铁制的火把或灯笼的壁炉，但没有火把或灯笼留下来。",
	"Marble floors and walls carry footfalls, voices, and other echoes throughout the place.": "大理石地板和墙壁上的脚步声、声音和其他回声传遍了这里。",
	"Part of this room is partially submerged in green water, filling what might have once been a ceremonial pool. The rest of this marble chamber is a few stairs above the water line, but still mossy and slick with algae.": "这个房间的一部分被淹没在绿色的水中，填满了可能曾经是一个仪式水池的地方。这个大理石室的其余部分高出水线几级，但仍有青苔和滑腻的藻类。",
	"This space was intended for quiet contemplation and solemn services to honor the dead. It served those purposes for many years. Now it is rotting and crumbling. Loose treasures of monetary value were carried from here into area 6 by the grave-robbers before they died.": "这个空间的目的是用于安静的沉思和庄严的仪式以纪念死者。它为这些目的服务了许多年。现在，它正在腐烂，摇摇欲坠。盗墓者在死前将具有金钱价值的松散宝物从这里带到了6号区域。",
	"The green, iron gate meant to close off this chamber has been pried open. Part of the latch still clings to the marble frame. The stone sarcophagi inside appear intact, but the place is a mess of leaves, mud, and toppled urns.": "用来关闭这个房间的绿色铁门已经被撬开。门闩的一部分仍然粘在大理石框架上。里面的石棺似乎完好无损，但这个地方被树叶、泥土和倒下的骨灰盒弄得一团糟。",
	"This area was thoroughly looted by the grave-robbers a few years ago. All items of monetary value are now in area 6, where the robbers took them before they died.": "几年前，这个区域被盗墓者彻底洗劫一空。所有具有金钱价值的物品现在都在第6区，强盗们在死前把它们带到了那里。",
	"The iron gate meant to guard this chamber hangs on its last hinge. The room beyond is stained with mud and blood, littered with torn clothes and cast-off buckles. A rusty axe juts from dead vines and reeds tangled in the muddy floor.": "用来守卫这个房间的铁门挂在最后的铰链上。外面的房间沾满了泥土和鲜血，到处都是破损的衣服和脱落的搭扣。一把锈迹斑斑的斧头从枯萎的藤蔓和纠缠在泥地上的芦苇中伸出来。",
	"The grave-robbers fled here to save their spoils and their lives from the attack of the shambling mound. They failed. Amid inches of mud and debris on the ground are their rotting backpacks and the treasures they gathered.": "盗墓者逃到这里，以挽救他们的战利品和他们的生命，使其免受晃动的土丘的攻击。他们失败了。在地面上数英寸的泥土和碎片中，是他们腐烂的背包和他们收集的财物。",
	"If they have not already, the three specters attack when \"their\" treasures are disturbed here.": "如果还没有，这三个幽灵会在 \"他们 \"的宝藏被打扰时进行攻击。",
	"The grave-robbers had gathered grave goods, candlesticks, metal fixtures, and other art objects worth a total of 440 gp, plus a {@item spell scroll} of {@spell lesser restoration}, a {@item Potion of Greater Healing||potion of healing (greater)}, and a {@item chime of opening}.": "盗墓者收集了墓地物品、烛台、金属装置和其他艺术品，总价值440金币，另外还有一个{@item spell scroll}的{@spell lesser restoration}，一个{@item Potion of Greater Healing||potion of healing (greater)}，和一个{@item chime of opening}。",
	"This wide, grand hall hosts rows of sealed compartments for coffins and urns. The room is angled roughly to the west, where it has settled unevenly. Water has clearly half-flooded this room before, based on the water damage and masses of rushes, vines, and reeds clinging to the mossy walls. Golden pans, meant to hold lamp oil, hang from the ceiling.": "这个宽阔而宏伟的大厅里摆放着一排排密封的棺材和骨灰盒的隔间。这个房间大致向西倾斜，那里已经不均匀地沉降了。根据水渍和附着在长满青苔的墙壁上的大量芦苇、藤蔓和芦苇，水显然曾经半淹没过这个房间。天花板上挂着用来盛放灯油的金锅。",
	"The leader of the grave-robbers had barely set foot in this chamber when he was attacked. As such, it faintly glitters with traces of silver and gold from chalices, medals, statuettes, and other mementos.": "盗墓者的首领被袭击时，几乎没有踏入这个房间。因此，它微弱地闪烁着来自圣杯、奖章、雕像和其他纪念品的银和金的痕迹。",
	"A total of thirty-six people were interred in the eastern wall of this chamber. As was the custom in Secomber, none of them were interred with treasures of note.": "在这个密室的东墙，总共有36人被埋葬。按照塞孔伯的惯例，他们都没有被埋葬在值得注意的宝物中。",

	"In the corridor, 30 feet beyond the once-sealed doorway, Sylvene installed one of her magic stele traps, facing this door. It has disadvantage on its passive {@skill Perception} score to detect trespassers peering through the gaps in the doorway.": "在走廊里，曾经被封住的门洞外30英尺处，希尔维尼安装了一个她的魔法石碑陷阱，正对着这扇门。它的被动得分{@skill Perception}对探测从门缝中窥视的闯入者有不利作用。",
	"The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. This stele can emit lightning a total of three times before becoming nothing more than inert stone.": "闪电会点燃该区域内没有被佩戴或携带的易燃物。这个石碑在变成惰性石头之前，总共可以发出三次闪电。",
	"Marks of safe passage found in the Wizard's Barrow, in a previous adventure, also work here. Creatures wearing a medallion of safe passage do not trigger the magic stele trap but are not immune to its lightning if it is triggered by someone or something else.": "在之前的冒险中，在巫师墓穴中发现的安全通道的标记，在这里也能发挥作用。戴着安全通道徽章的生物不会触发魔法石碑的陷阱，但如果它是由其他人或东西触发的，则对其闪电没有免疫力。",
	"Aside from housing the trap, this corridor is meant simply to set Waltarn's crypt deeper into the cliff face, to protect it from erosion and settling for a time.": "除了放置陷阱外，这条走廊只是为了将华塔恩的墓穴设置在崖壁深处，以保护它在一段时间内不被侵蚀和沉降。",
	"Red granite supports and details, from rock frequently mined along the nearby cliffs, enliven the gray stones here. Although this corridor is clearly of more recent construction, it struggles against the shifting ground, too. Fitted stones are being pulled apart from each other over years of slow movement.": "红色的花岗岩支架和细节，来自附近悬崖上经常开采的岩石，使这里的灰色石头更加生动。尽管这条走廊显然是最近建造的，但它也在与不断变化的地面作斗争。在多年的缓慢运动中，合身的石头被拉开了。",
