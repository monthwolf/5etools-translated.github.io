	"More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver's Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power. Human spellcasters allied themselves with the dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great forge (called the Forge of Spells), where magic items could be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin (pronounced fan-duh-lin) prospered as well. But then disaster struck when orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path.": "五百多年前，矮人和地精的部族达成了一项被称为 \"潘德夫契约 \"的协议，根据该协议，他们将在一个被称为 \"波浪回声洞 \"的奇妙洞穴中分享一个丰富的矿场。除了矿产资源外，这个矿场还蕴含着巨大的魔法力量。人类施法者与矮人和地精结盟，将这种能量引导并结合到一个伟大的锻造厂（称为 \"法术锻造厂\"），在那里可以制作魔法物品。时代是美好的，附近的人类城镇Phandalin（发音为fan-duh-lin）也随之繁荣起来。但是，当兽人横扫北方，把所有的东西都毁掉的时候，灾难发生了。",
	"A powerful force of orcs reinforced by evil mercenary wizards attacked Wave Echo Cave to seize its riches and magic treasures. Human wizards fought alongside their dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of Spells, and the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern. Few survived the cave-ins and tremors, and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.": "一支强大的兽人部队在邪恶的佣兵巫师的增援下袭击了波浪回音洞，以夺取其财富和魔法宝藏。人类巫师与他们的矮人和地精盟友并肩作战，保卫法术锻造室，随后的法术战斗摧毁了洞穴的大部分。很少有人能从塌陷和震荡中幸存下来，波浪回音洞的位置也随之丢失。",
	"For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine. In recent years, people have resettled the area. Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town. More important, the Rockseeker brothers—a trio of dwarves-have discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave, and they intend to reopen the mines.": "几个世纪以来，关于埋藏财富的传言吸引了寻宝者和机会主义者来到范达林周围地区，但从来没有人成功地找到失落的矿井。近年来，人们重新安置了这一地区。范达林现在是一个粗制滥造的边陲小镇。更重要的是，Rockseeker兄弟--三个矮人--已经发现了Wave Echo洞穴的入口，他们打算重新开矿。",
	"Unfortunately for the Rockseekers, they are not the only ones interested in Wave Echo Cave.

	"In part 2, \"Phandalin,\" the characters arrive in Phandalin to find it terrorized by the Redbrands, a gang of miscreants led by a mysterious figure called Glasstaff. A number of interesting NPCs can also be found in Phandalin, laying the hooks for short adventures in part 3. The Redbrands try to run the characters out of town, so the characters return the favor and storm the Redbrand lair. In a hidden stronghold beneath an old manor, they find that Iarno \"Glasstaff\" Albrek, the leader of the Redbrands, is taking his orders from someone called the Black Spider-and that the Black Spider wants the adventurers out of the picture.": "在第二部分 \"范达林 \"中，角色们来到范达林，发现它被Redbrands恐吓着，这是一帮由一个叫Glasstaff的神秘人物领导的恶棍。在范达林还可以找到一些有趣的NPC，为第三部分的短期冒险埋下了伏笔。Redbrands试图把人物赶出镇子，所以人物以牙还牙，冲进了Redbrand的老巢。在一个古老庄园下的隐蔽据点里，他们发现红番军的首领Iarno \"Glasstaff\" Albrek正听命于一个叫黑蜘蛛的人--而且黑蜘蛛希望冒险者们离开这里。",
	"Part 3, \"The Spider's Web,\" provides the characters with several short adventures in the region around Phandalin as they search for more information about the Black Spider and the dwarves' lost mine. The clues the characters picked up in Phandalin can lead them to spy on a mysterious wizard at the ruins of Old Owl Well, seek the advice of a dangerous banshee, oust a band of orcs lurking at Wyvern Tor, and investigate the ruins of the town of Thundertree.": "第三部分，\"蜘蛛网\"，为人物提供了在范达林周围地区的几个简短的冒险，因为他们要寻找更多关于黑蜘蛛和矮人丢失的矿场的信息。角色们在范达林捡到的线索可以引导他们在老猫头鹰井的废墟上窥探一个神秘的巫师，寻求一个危险的女妖的建议，赶走潜伏在怀恩托的一伙兽人，并调查雷树镇的废墟。",
	"Several of these leads point to Cragmaw Castle, which is the stronghold of King Grol, leader of the Cragmaw goblins. Here the characters discover that the Black Spider is a drow adventurer named Nezznar, and that the Cragmaw goblins work for him (drow are elves who hail from a realm deep underground). More importantly, they recover {@creature Gundren Rockseeker|LMoP}'s map to the lost mine, or learn the mine's location from one of the other leads they unearth during part 3.": "其中有几条线索指向克拉格玛城堡，它是克拉格玛妖精的首领格罗尔国王的据点。在这里，角色们发现黑蜘蛛是一个名叫Nezznar的乌鸦冒险家，而克拉格马夫地精为他工作（乌鸦是来自地下深处的精灵）。更重要的是，他们找到了{@creature Gundren Rockseeker|LMoP}通往失落矿井的地图，或者从第三部分中发现的其他线索中得知矿井的位置。",
	"Following the map or the directions to the lost mine brings the characters to part 4, \"Wave Echo Cave.\" That lost underground complex is now overrun by undead and strange monsters. {@creature Nezznar the Black Spider|LMoP} is there with his loyal followers, exploring the mines and searching for the legendary Forge of Spells. The adventurers have the opportunity to avenge {@creature Gundren Rockseeker|LMoP}, to ensure the prosperity and security of Phandalin by clearing the rich mine of its monsters, and to put an end to the troublemaking of the Black Spider-if they can survive the dangers of the Lost Mine of Phandelver.": "按照地图或迷失矿场的指示，人物来到第四部分，\"波浪回音洞\"。那个失落的地下建筑群现在已经被亡灵和奇怪的怪物所占领。{@creature Nezznar the Black Spider|LMoP}在那里和他忠诚的追随者一起，探索矿井，寻找传说中的法术锻造器。冒险家们有机会为{@creature Gundren Rockseeker|LMoP}报仇，通过清除富饶的矿井中的怪物来确保潘达林的繁荣和安全，并结束黑蜘蛛的捣乱行为--如果他们能在潘达弗迷失矿井的危险中生存下来的话。",
	"You can let players invent their own reasons for visiting Phandalin, or you can use the following adventure hook. The backgrounds and secondary goals on the character sheets also provide characters with motivations for visiting Phandalin.": "你可以让玩家自己发明访问范达林的理由，也可以使用下面的冒险钩子。人物表上的背景和次要目标也为人物提供了访问范达林的动机。",
	"The characters are in the city of Neverwinter when their dwarf patron and friend, {@creature Gundren Rockseeker|LMoP}, hires them to escort a wagon to Phandalin. Gundren has gone ahead with a warrior, {@creature Sildar Hallwinter|LMoP}, to attend to business in the town while the characters follow with the supplies. The characters will be paid 10 gp each by the owner of Barthen's Provisions in Phandalin when they deliver the wagon safely to that trading post.": "当他们的矮人赞助人和朋友{@creature Gundren Rockseeker|LMoP}雇佣他们护送一辆马车到范达林时，角色们正在永夜城中。冈德伦带着一名战士（%%）先行一步，去处理镇上的事务，而人物则带着物资跟随。当他们把马车安全送到范达林的贸易站时，范达林的Barthen's Provisions店主会付给他们每人10戈比。",
	"One of the things that you can do as the DM is reward players for roleplaying their characters well.": "作为DM，你可以做的一件事是奖励玩家对他们的角色进行良好的角色扮演。",
	"Each of the characters included in this set has two personality traits (one positive and one negative), an ideal, a bond, and a flaw. These elements can make the character easier and more fun to roleplay. Personality traits provide a glimpse into the character's likes, dislikes, accomplishments, fears, attitude, or mannerisms. An ideal is something that the character believes in or strives for above all else. A character's bond represents a connection to a person, place, or event in the world-someone the character cares about, a place the holds a special connection, or a treasured possession. A flaw is a characteristic that someone else can exploit to bring the character to ruin or cause the character to act against his or her best interests.": "这套书中的每个人物都有两个性格特征（一个是正面的，一个是负面的），一个理想，一个纽带和一个缺陷。这些要素可以使角色更容易、更有趣地进行角色扮演。个性特征提供了对该角色的喜欢、不喜欢、成就、恐惧、态度或举止的一瞥。理想是指人物所相信的或为之奋斗的东西，高于其他一切。人物的纽带代表着与世界上某个人、某个地方或某个事件的联系--人物所关心的某个人、与之有特殊联系的某个地方、或某个珍贵的财产。缺陷是指别人可以利用的特性，使人物走向毁灭或使人物的行为违背他或她的最佳利益。",
	"When a player roleplays a negative personality trait or gives in to the drawbacks presented by a bond or flaw, you can give that player one inspiration as a reward. A player with inspiration can use it in a situation where his or her character's personality traits, ideal, or bond relate to what's happening. Spending inspiration gives the character advantage on one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.": "当一个玩家扮演了一个消极的人格特征，或者屈服于纽带或缺陷所带来的弊端，你可以给这个玩家一个灵感作为奖励。拥有灵感的玩家可以在他或她的角色的个性特征、理想或纽带与正在发生的事情有关的情况下使用它。花费灵感可以使该角色在一次能力检查、攻击卷或蓄力上获得优势。",
	"A character can have only one inspiration at a time.": "一个角色在同一时间只能有一个灵感。",
	"Just like a fantasy novel or movie, an adventure is set in a larger world. In fact, the world can be anything that the DM and players can imagine. It could be a swords-and-sorcery setting at the dawn of civilization, where barbarians battle evil sorcerers, or a post-apocalyptic fantasy where elves and dwarves wield magic amid the wreckage of a technological civilization. Most D&D settings are somewhere between those two extremes: worlds of medieval high fantasy with knights and castles, as well as elven cities, dwarven mines, and fearsome monsters.": "就像奇幻小说或电影一样，冒险的背景是一个更大的世界。事实上，这个世界可以是DM和玩家所能想象的任何东西。它可以是文明初期的剑与魔法背景，野蛮人与邪恶的巫师作战；也可以是末世的幻想，精灵和矮人在科技文明的残骸中挥舞魔法。大多数D&D设定介于这两个极端之间：有骑士和城堡的中世纪高级幻想世界，以及精灵城市、矮人矿场和可怕的怪物。",
	"The world of the Forgotten Realms is one such setting, and that's where the story in this adventure takes place. In the Realms, knights dare the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate. Clerics in the service of gods wield mace and spell, questing against the terrifying powers that threaten the land. Wizards plunder the ruins of the fallen Netherese empire, delving into secrets too dark for the light of day. Dragons, giants, demons, and unimaginable abominations lurk in dungeons, caverns, ruined cities, and the vast wild places of the world.": "被遗忘的领域世界就是这样一个背景，而这一冒险中的故事就发生在这里。在这个世界里，骑士们敢于进入戴尔松（Delzoun）的矮人国王的墓穴，寻求荣耀和财富。盗贼们在Neverwinter和Baldur's Gate等繁华城市的黑暗小巷中游荡。为神灵服务的教士们挥舞着法杖和咒语，寻求对抗威胁土地的可怕力量。巫师们在堕落的尼瑟斯帝国的废墟上进行掠夺，深入研究那些黑暗到无法见光的秘密。龙、巨人、恶魔和难以想象的憎恶潜伏在地牢、洞穴、废墟和世界的广阔荒野中。",
	"On the roads and rivers of the Realms travel minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers, sailors, and steel-hearted adventurers carrying tales of strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can take even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world. Thousands of restless would-be heroes from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages arrive in Neverwinter and the other great cities every year in search of wealth and renown.": "在王国的道路和河流上，游吟诗人和小贩、商人和卫兵、士兵、水手和铁石心肠的冒险家，带着陌生、光荣、遥远的地方的故事。好的地图和清晰的小路甚至可以把一个没有经验的青年带向世界的远方，实现他的荣耀梦想。每年都有数以千计来自乡间农庄和沉睡村庄的不安分的未来英雄来到永夜城和其他大城市，寻找财富和名声。",
	"Known roads may be well traveled, but they aren't necessarily safe. Fell magic, deadly monsters, and cruel local rulers are all perils that you face when you travel in the Forgotten Realms. Even farms and freeholds within a day's walk of a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.": "已知的道路可能很好走，但它们不一定安全。堕落的魔法、致命的怪物和残酷的地方统治者都是你在被遗忘的领域中旅行时面临的危险。即使是离城市只有一天路程的农场和土地，也可能成为怪物的猎物，没有一个地方可以避免龙的突然发怒。",
	"The regional map shows just a tiny part of this vast world, in a region called the Sword Coast. This is a region of adventure, where daring souls delve into the wreckage of ancient strongholds and explore ruins of long-lost cultures. Amid a wilderness of jagged, snow-capped peaks, alpine forests, lawlessness, and monsters, the coast holds the greatest bastions of civilization, including the coastal city of Neverwinter.": "区域地图显示的只是这个广阔世界的一小部分，在一个叫做剑海岸的地区。这是一个冒险的地区，大胆的灵魂在这里深入到古代据点的残骸中，探索久违的文化遗迹。在一片由参差不齐的雪峰、高山森林、无法无天和怪物组成的荒野中，沿海地区拥有最伟大的文明堡垒，包括沿海城市永冬。",
	"The adventure begins as the player characters are escorting a wagon full of provisions and supplies from Neverwinter to Phandalin.

Gundren was clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found \"something big,\" and that he'd pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting his supplies safely to Barthen's Provisions, a trading post in Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with a warrior escort named {@creature Sildar Hallwinter|LMoP}, claiming he needed to arrive early to \"take care of business.\"": "在永夜城，一个名叫{@creature Gundren Rockseeker|LMoP}的矮人让你把一马车的补给品带到城市东南方几天路程的潘达林的粗犷定居点。冈德伦显然很兴奋，而且对他此行的原因有点保密，只说他和他的兄弟们发现了 \"大东西\"，他将支付你每人10个金币，以护送他的物资安全到达范达林的贸易站--巴特恩的物资。然后他骑着马在你前面出发了，还有一个叫{@creature Sildar Hallwinter|LMoP}的护卫战士，声称他需要提前到达 \"处理生意\"。",

A bustling frontier settlement has grown up on the site of the old town, and is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. Unfortunately, more than a few bandits and brigands have settled here as well, taking advantage of the fact that the area has no local lord or authority to chase them off. A gang known as the Redbrands has controlled Phandalin for the past two months, extorting and bullying everyone in town. The gang is led by a mysterious figure known to the townsfolk as Glasstaff.": "在过去的三四年里，来自永夜城和水底城的坚韧不拔的定居者们已经开始了开垦范达林废墟的艰苦工作。一个繁华的边境定居点已经在旧城的遗址上成长起来，现在是农民、樵夫、毛皮商人和被剑山山麓的黄金和铂金故事吸引的勘探者的家。不幸的是，一些土匪和强盗也在这里定居，利用这个地区没有当地领主或当局来驱赶他们的事实。在过去的两个月里，一个被称为 \"红帮 \"的团伙控制了范达林，敲诈勒索和欺负镇上的每个人。该团伙由一个被镇民称为格拉斯塔夫的神秘人物领导。",

Still, the nothic is untrustworthy.": "这个洞穴的守护者是一个{@creature nothic}，一个疯狂的地下怪物，渴望着肉体。这个怪物被从裂缝中发出的微弱的魔法效果所引诱，在红袍军团进驻时占据了这个区域。伊阿诺设法与怪物达成了交易，说服它帮助守卫据点，以换取财宝和偶尔的鲜肉礼物。不过，这个怪物还是不值得信任。",
	"The nothic communicates using telepathy. If detected, it prefers to negotiate and isn't above betraying the Redbrands for the right incentive, such as the promise of food. When roleplaying the nothic, consider speaking in whispers and throwing in some mad cackles and bits of gibberish.

A creature that fails the check by 5 or more falls and takes {@damage 1d6} bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing {@condition prone} at the bottom.": "裂缝深20英尺。不使用绳索爬上或爬下需要成功的DC 10 力量检定({@skill Athletics})。如果生物检定失败5点或更多，将摔倒并每摔下10英尺受到{@damage 1d6} 钝击伤害，最终落地时受到{@condition prone} 伤害。",
	"Nezznar's divinations are accurate. Buried under heavy rubble at the bottom of the rift is the crushed skeleton of a dwarf wearing {@item gauntlets of ogre power}. The remains are hidden from view but can be found with a successful DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. Each character searching can attempt one check per hour.": "奈兹纳的占卜准确无误。在峡谷底部被厚重瓦砾覆盖的地方，有一具被压碎的矮人骷髅，身穿着{@item gauntlets of ogre power}。这具遗骸被隐藏起来，但可以通过成功的DC 20感知({@skill Perception})检定找到。每位搜索的角色每小时可以尝试一次检定。",
	"{@creature Nezznar the Black Spider|LMoP} is joined by four {@creature giant spider||giant spiders} that defend their master to the death. If they are expecting trouble, the spiders hide behind pillars, and Nezznar casts {@spell invisibility} on himself and stands near the table.

Nezznar joins the fray on the round after the spiders attack.": "{@creature Nezznar the Black Spider|LMoP} 被四只{@creature giant spider||giant spiders} 所伴随，它们将捍卫他们的主人至死。如果它们预料到麻烦，蜘蛛们会躲在柱子后面，而尼兹纳会对自己施放{@spell invisibility} 并站在桌子附近。为蜘蛛们进行敏捷度检定（{@skill Stealth}）。当入侵者出现时，蜘蛛们会试图用蛛网缠住他们，然后再进入近战范围。尼兹纳会在蜘蛛们发动攻击后的回合加入战斗。",
	"The statue depicts Dumathoin, the dwarven god of mining. Any character who has proficiency in {@skill Religion} recognizes the deity. The statue is beautifully carved, and its emerald eyes appear extremely valuable. However, the jewels are clever fakes made of worthless glass, as close inspection and a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check reveals. Nevertheless, a powerful spell protects them, and a {@spell detect magic} spell reveals a strong aura of abjuration magic surrounding the statue.": "这座雕像描绘了矮人矿神杜玛索因(Dumathoin)。任何具备{@skill Religion}熟练的角色都能认出这位神明。雕像被精美地雕刻，它的翡翠眼睛看起来非常珍贵。然而，这些宝石都是精巧的赝品，由毫无价值的玻璃制成，仔细检查并成功通过DC 15的智力检定({@skill Investigation})后会揭示真相。尽管如此，一个强大的法术保护着它们，一个{@spell detect magic}法术会揭示雕像周围强大的驱护魔法光环。",

	"This room formerly belonged to the priest in charge of Dumathoin's temple ({@area 19|18b}), but Nezznar has appropriated it for use as a cell. The figure lying on the floor is {@creature Nundro Rockseeker|lmop|Nundro}, a dwarf {@creature commoner} and the youngest of the three Rockseeker brothers. Nezznar spared him because he thought the dwarf might know more about the mine than he admitted. The drow has interrogated Nundro harshly once or twice a day ever since capturing him.": "这个房间原先属于负责Dumathoin神庙的牧师({@area 19|18b})，但尼兹纳却占为己有，用作囚室。躺在地板上的人是{@creature Nundro Rockseeker|lmop|Nundro}，一名矮人{@creature commoner}，也是三兄弟中最年轻的。尼兹纳放过他，因为他认为这名矮人可能知道比他承认的更多关于矿山的事情。自从俘虏他以来，那个黑暗精灵每天都会严厉地审问Nundro一两次。",
	"By the end of the adventure, the characters should be 5th level.

	"Certain magic items require a user to {@b attune} to them before their magical properties can be used. Attuning to a magic item requires that you spend a short rest concentrating on it (this can't be the same short rest used to learn an item's properties). Depending on the nature of the item, this concentration can take the form of prayers, weapon practice, or meditation. In any case, the concentration period must be uninterrupted. Once you are attuned to an item, you can use its magical properties.": "某些魔法物品需要用户在使用它们之前对其进行{@b attune}。要调谐魔法物品，您需要花费一段时间专注于它（这不能是用于了解物品属性的同一段时间）。根据物品的性质，这种专注可以采取祈祷、武器练习或冥想的形式。无论如何，专注的时间必须是不间断的。一旦您调谐了一个物品，您就可以使用它的魔法属性。"
