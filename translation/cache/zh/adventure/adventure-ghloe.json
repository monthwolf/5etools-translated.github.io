	"From its deep and forbidding forests, where horrific aberrations lurk, to the hulking and impenetrable mountain ranges where lost legacies lie, the landscape of Etharis is formidable. However, the true monsters of this land are found in the degenerating cities of old, where humanity clings to survival. While nefarious figures entice those who seek power, the devotees of dead gods punish the impious. There are few heroes in a world as morally corrupted as this. The only hope in Etharis is that which you bring, yourself.": "从其深邃而可怕的森林，那里潜伏着可怕的畸变，到高大而难以穿透的山脉，那里埋藏着失落的遗产，以太里斯（Etharis）的景观令人敬畏。然而，这片土地上真正的怪物存在于那些正在堕落的古老城市中，那里人类艰难地生存着。邪恶的人物引诱着那些追求权力的人，而死神的信徒则惩罚不虔诚者。在这个道德败坏的世界中，几乎没有英雄。以太里斯唯一的希望就是你自己所带来的。",
	"Etharis is the official world for the Grim Hollow setting. The adventures found herein are an introduction to this gritty and dangerous realm. The rules added in the Grim Hollow tomes are designed for weaving dark fantasy tales. Blood magic, undeath, lycanthropy, fey bargains, fell sorcery, and other temptations: would-be heroes are always one wrong step away from becoming the villains they claim to fight.": "伊萨瑞斯（Etharis）是《阴森之地》（Grim Hollow）设定的官方世界。这里的冒险是对这个充满沉重和危险的领域的介绍。《阴森之地》卷中添加的规则旨在编织黑暗幻想故事。血魔法、不死之身、狼人病、精灵交易、邪恶巫术以及其他诱惑：那些意欲成为英雄的人，总是离成为他们声称要对抗的恶棍只有一步之遥。",
	"{@i Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis} offers a wealth of new creature stat blocks, allowing GMs to challenge, frighten, and delight their players. From new characters cutting their teeth on relatively weak threats, to the most advanced monster slayers dealing with world-shattering events, the monsters in this book offer something for everyone.": "{@i Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis}提供了大量新的生物统计数据，让GM们能够挑战、恐吓和取悦他们的玩家。从新角色在相对较弱的威胁中磨练自己，到最高级的怪物杀手应对世界颠覆性事件，本书中的怪物为每个人都提供了一些内容。",
	"The monsters are drawn from every corner of horror and dark fantasy: gothic intrigue, existential dread, gruesome fairy tales, slasher horror, undead hoards, body horror, killer dolls, and so much more.": "这些怪物来自恐怖和黑暗奇幻的各个角落：哥特式阴谋、存在主义恐惧、血腥的童话故事、切割恐怖、不死军团、肉体恐怖、杀人玩偶等等。",
	"With so many horrible monsters and threats at your fingertips, there's a good chance that something presented here will bring into your players' minds something that they're uncomfortable with.

Gore, child endangerment, loss of free will, nightmares: all of these and more infest these pages.": "在你手中有这么多可怕的怪物和威胁，很可能这里呈现的内容会让你的玩家想到一些让他们感到不舒服的事情。在使用这些怪物之前，或者进行任何基于恐怖的活动之前，我们建议你与玩家讨论他们的偏好、愿望和限制。血腥、儿童危险、自由意志的丧失、噩梦：所有这些等等都存在于这些页面中。",
	"The previous Grim Hollow books talk about safety tools and methods you can use to ensure that everyone involved in your game is having a good time and avoiding problematic material. We suggest you review those guidelines—or use other safety tool procedures and guidelines—to learn more about running games, especially games steeped in horror and dark fantasy, for any player.": "之前的《黑暗荒野》系列书籍讨论了安全工具和方法，您可以使用这些工具和方法来确保参与游戏的每个人都能玩得开心，避免出现问题的内容。我们建议您查阅这些准则，或者使用其他安全工具程序和准则，以了解更多关于如何主持游戏的信息，尤其是那些充满恐怖和黑暗幻想元素的游戏，适用于任何玩家。",
	"Etharis provides a great setting for a grim, gritty campaign. One tool provided in {@i Lairs of Etharis} is salvage rules. These rules encourage a type of play that invites characters to make the most of their knowledge and proficiencies, as well as their downtime, to have the best chance of surviving the threats they face. The blood, bones, brains, and bile of the creatures they kill might provide characters advantages later. Weapons, potions, components, and other magic items might not be readily available, but the characters can make their own from salvaged parts of monsters. And in some cases, monsters might be nigh invulnerable unless the characters use their wits.": "伊萨瑞斯提供了一个适合进行阴郁、现实主义战役的绝佳背景。其中提供的一种工具是{@i Lairs of Etharis}中的打捞规则。这些规则鼓励一种类型的游戏，邀请角色充分利用他们的知识和熟练技能，以及他们的空闲时间，以便有最好的机会生存下来面对的威胁。他们杀死的生物的血液、骨头、大脑和胆汁可能会为角色提供后续的优势。武器、药水、材料和其他魔法物品可能不容易获得，但角色可以利用怪物的打捞部分制作自己的物品。在某些情况下，怪物可能几乎无法被击败，除非角色动用智慧。",
	"Like the salvage rules, lore plays an important part in a dark fantasy setting. Characters may be in trouble if they don't take the time to learn more about the monsters they face. Local legends about a beast may be myth or folly, but even within the folk tales, there could be an iota of truth—and that truth could be the difference between surviving an encounter and suffering an ultimate defeat.": "与打捞规则一样，传说在黑暗奇幻设定中扮演着重要角色。角色们如果不花时间了解他们所面对的怪物，可能会陷入麻烦。关于某种野兽的当地传说可能是神话或愚蠢的，但即使在民间传说中，也可能包含一丁点真相——而这个真相可能是在遭遇中生存和遭受最终失败之间的区别。",
	"The ability checks associated with each monster are meant to provide details on what a character might know about a monster—or what a character might find out. Use these checks to dole out important information. Some checks might require characters to do some research, or even face the creature to observe its traits and behavior. Failed checks could result in characters gaining incorrect or partial bits of information, which could lead to dire consequences.": "每个怪物相关的能力检定旨在提供有关角色可能了解的怪物详情，或者角色可能发现的信息。利用这些检定来分发重要信息。有些检定可能需要角色进行一些研究，甚至面对这个生物以观察其特征和行为。失败的检定可能导致角色获得不正确或部分信息片段，这可能导致严重后果。",
	"Regardless of how you run your games, or what your players want from a game, it's important to remember that the goal of playing this game is to have fun and tell great stories. The monsters in this book are there to challenge characters, but they're also there to enhance stories. No bit of lore or game mechanical number is more important than the fun and the story. Change whatever you must to ensure everyone at the table enjoys themselves, contributes to the story, and leaves the table satisfied.": "无论你如何主持游戏，或者你的玩家希望从游戏中得到什么，重要的是要记住玩这个游戏的目的是为了享受乐趣并讲述精彩的故事。这本书中的怪物旨在挑战角色，但它们也旨在增强故事。没有任何传说或游戏机械数字比乐趣和故事更重要。改变任何必要的内容，以确保每个人在桌旁都能享受自己，为故事做出贡献，并满足地离开桌旁。",

	"The GM's role is to establish the setting of each scene in the Lair, introduce and portray its nonplayer characters (NPCs), and play monsters and villains who long to bring a swift end to the heroes' adventures. The players at your table are storytellers in their own right.

The caverns include its bone manse (a haunting negotiations chamber), a nest for its tamed knifewings, a storeroom, and private chambers. Outside the caverns is the forest, which hides the huts of Fibekruk's faevlin minions, their refuse pit, and a ruined cottage used as a storage space.": "骨头交易者Fibekruk已经将其“庄园”建在这片毗邻森林的山腰凉爽的洞穴中。洞穴包括它的骨头大厦（一个令人不安的谈判室）、用于驯养刀翼兽的巢穴、一个储藏室和私人房间。洞穴外是森林，森林中隐藏着Fibekruk的妖精仆从的小屋、他们的垃圾坑和一个废弃的小屋，用作储藏空间。",
	"The bone trader is busy polishing and cleaning its bone collection; its recent efforts have brought it a measure of success, allowing it to move from animal bones to much more prestigious (and tasty) human bones. The creatures it has pressed into service rest comfortably in their nest, content that the faevlin bring them enough snacks—and that the faevlin themselves are always available as snacks if necessary. A small tribe of nine faevlin are spread out across the Bone House. One is assisting the bone trader with its work. Two are moving supplies into the ruined cabin. Two more are searching the refuse pit for trinkets and gold. Two are out hunting (and can return if the characters take too long exploring or dealing with the lair) while two are sleeping in the huts at the camp. If the faevlin have recently abducted anyone, the abductees are imprisoned in the animals' nesting chamber.": "骨头交易者正忙着擦拭和清洁它的骨头收藏品；它最近的努力取得了一定的成功，使它能够从动物骨头转向更加有声望（和美味）的人类骨头。它所驱使的生物正舒适地休息在它们的巢穴中，满足于faevlin给它们带来足够的零食——而且faevlin自己也随时可以作为必要时的零食。九只faevlin小部落分散在骨头之屋中。一只正在协助骨头交易者工作。两只正在将补给品搬进那座废弃小屋。另外两只正在垃圾坑中搜寻小玩意和金子。另外两只正在外出狩猎（如果角色探索或处理巢穴的时间太长，它们可能会返回），而另外两只正在营地的小屋里睡觉。如果faevlin最近绑架了任何人，被绑架者被囚禁在动物的筑巢室内。",

	"Fibekruk has lately ordered the faevlin to collect bones from humans living in the nearby villages. The characters have been hired by a local village to deal with the faevlin spotted in the area. Perhaps someone close to the characters has also been abducted, and the trail led here.

Of course, it's also possible the characters simply run across the Bone House in their explorations.": "费贝克鲁克最近命令费夫林（Faevlin）收集附近村庄居民的骨头。这些角色已经被当地村庄雇佣，以应对该地区发现的费夫林。也许角色中有人的亲近者也被绑架了，线索就指向这里。如果角色们在长时间离开后（也许在遥远的地方接受培训后）回到这个地区，这座废弃的小屋可能对其中一个或多个角色具有重要意义。当然，角色们也可能在探索中偶然发现了骨头之屋（Bone House）。",
	"The lair is described as it is during nighttime hours, when the faevlin do their best work. During the day, two sleepy faevlin stand watch with the knifewings while the rest of the faevlin sleep in their huts. The bone trader also rests during the day. The only light sources at night are the cooking fire in the faevlin camp and the braziers (kept burning constantly) in the bone manse. Otherwise, the forest and cavern are dark. Characters observing the scene see the faevlin eventually swap places or jobs, but other than the day-night crew change, the faevlin always divide into work crews.": "在夜间，巢穴被描述为费夫林们发挥最佳能力的时候。白天，两只昏昏欲睡的费夫林和刀翼兽守卫着，而其他费夫林则在自己的小屋里睡觉。骨头交易者也在白天休息。夜晚唯一的光源是费夫林营地的炊火和骨庄园中那些（持续燃烧着的）火盆。除此之外，森林和洞穴都是黑暗的。观察这一场景的角色会看到费夫林们最终交换位置或工作，但除了白天和夜晚交接的班次变动外，费夫林们总是分成工作组。",

	"Dealing with the bone trader is making a proverbial deal with the devil: you likely get what you want in the here and now, with regrettable consequences down the line. For example, bone traders are willing to give up immediate gratification (snacking on a character or one of the character's NPC friends) in exchange for long-term satisfaction (such as a blood oath that the character will bring {@i two} humanoids for it to feast on before the next full moon). Captured characters unwilling or unable to make a deal may find themselves fed on, one at a time, over the next few days. Escape is always possible, of course!": "与骨头交易者打交道就像与魔鬼交易一样：你可能会立刻得到想要的东西，但会在未来付出后悔的代价。例如，骨头交易者愿意放弃即时满足（吞食一个角色或角色的NPC朋友）以换取长期满足（比如一个血誓，角色在下一个满月之前要给它带来{@i two}个人形生物供其享用）。被捕获的角色如果不愿意或无法达成交易，可能会在接下来的几天里被一次又一次地吞食。当然，逃跑总是有可能的！",

	"If hauled back to civilization, most of these supplies can be returned to their original owners.

	"The characters may tussle with and eventually make a deal with the bone trader. Villagers don't usually have a lot of coin to use as payoff, so rewards they offer may be in information (perhaps leading to a new adventure) or admiration. If necessary, the villagers can give the characters 10 gp each to convince the bone trader to stop preying on them. This is reduced to 5 gp each if they are only able to convince the bone trader to agree not to hunt the people, leaving the animals as fair game. Obviously, if the characters make a deal that saves their own bones but doesn't account for nearby villages' needs, the villages won't pay them anything!": "人物可能会与骨头交易者搏斗，最终达成交易。村民通常没有太多硬币用作报酬，所以他们提供的奖励可能是信息（也许会导致新的冒险）或者是钦佩。如果必要，村民可以给每个角色10 gp，说服骨头交易者停止对他们的掠夺。如果他们只能说服骨头交易者同意不再猎杀人类，而只猎杀动物，那么每人只需支付5 gp。显然，如果人物达成的交易只是为了保全自己的骨头，而没有考虑到附近村庄的需求，那么村庄将不会支付他们任何报酬！",
	"Dealing with the bone trader could be the first step toward helping a local ruler regain control of their fiefdom, leading the characters back to them for another quest against sinister forces in these lands. The bone trader may mention that its own actions are limited by an even greater bone trader in another vale—one who has several bone trader vassals of its own! Or, perhaps, the bone trader is annoyed because the characters have been sent in breach of an existing contract, and the next adventure for the characters investigates who sent them into a deadly situation to get rid of Fibekruk!": "与骨头交易商打交道可能是帮助当地统治者重新掌控他们领地的第一步，引导角色们再次前往他们对抗这片土地上邪恶势力的另一个任务。骨头交易商可能会提到，它自己的行动受到另一个山谷中更强大的骨头交易商的限制——后者拥有自己的几个骨头交易商附庸！或者，也许骨头交易商感到恼火，因为角色们被派去违反了一项现有合同，角色们的下一个冒险将调查是谁派他们陷入致命局面以摆脱Fibekruk！",

	"Faren's Rest is a roadside village that grew up along a major trading route. Once, it was just an inn and tavern. Over time, it became an important waystation: a stable and a small hamlet grew up around the inn. A few generations ago, a local baron (Faren) got the bright idea to put a tax collector at the waystation. He quickly abused the tax, building a house across from the inn to keep an eye on things—along with a statue of himself as a heroic warrior. Eventually one of the baron's many enemies did him in, and Faren's Rest became independent once again.": "法伦之息是一座沿着主要贸易路线发展起来的路边村庄。最初，它只是一家客栈和酒馆。随着时间的推移，它变成了一个重要的驿站：一个马厩和一个小村庄围绕着客栈发展起来。几代人前，一位当地男爵（法伦）想到在驿站设立一个税收征收员。他很快滥用了税收，对着客栈对面建了一座房子来监视事物——还有一座描绘他自己作为英勇战士的雕像。最终，男爵的众多敌人之一将他铲除，法伦之息再次独立。",
	"Recently, the newest mayor of Faren's Rest, Rolant Joss, began acting strangely. In recent weeks, he's taken in an orphan child, hired bodyguards, and started talking about reviving Faren's dreaded tax.": "最近，法伦之息(`Faren's Rest`)的新市长，罗兰特·乔斯(`Rolant Joss`)，开始表现得很奇怪。最近几周，他收养了一个孤儿，雇佣了保镖，并开始谈论恢复法伦可怕的税收。",
	"The vitebriate is playing the role of the poor orphan child calling herself \"Rose,\" taken in by the mayor. Rose has grown greedy in her years of avoiding discovery and sees in Rolant an opportunity to play the long game and accumulate wealth from the old tax. Eventually, she figures, the town will get mad at Rolant (or she will use up her host), and either way she will be seen as the \"innocent victim\" rather than an unworthy beneficiary of the wealth, and she can disappear again. Unfortunately, her domination of Rolant is making him behave very strangely, and some in town fear something is wrong.": "这只脊椎动物扮演着一个自称“罗斯”、被市长收养的可怜孤儿的角色。罗斯在多年的躲避发现中变得贪婪，她看到罗兰特身上的机会，可以玩长期的游戏，从旧税收中积累财富。她认为，最终，镇上会对罗兰特生气（或者她会耗尽她的主人），无论哪种情况，她都会被视为“无辜的受害者”，而不是财富的不当受益者，然后她就可以再次消失。不幸的是，她对罗兰特的控制让他表现得非常奇怪，一些镇上的人担心出了问题。",
	"There are a few ways the characters might be involved. The easiest is that the inn and tavern (The Outrageous Pig) is a recommended waystation for the party. Perhaps they're on the way to another adventure, or perhaps they are returning from one.

She needs outsiders to talk to the mayor and try to convince him not to revive Faren's road toll and tax.": "角色可能会以几种方式参与其中。最简单的方式是客栈和酒馆(疯狂猪)是队伍的推荐中转站。也许他们正在前往另一个冒险地点，或者他们正在从一个冒险地点返回。当他们到达休息的时候（从探险或旅行中），店主贝莎·马蒂尔迪斯请队伍帮忙。她需要外人与市长交谈，并试图说服他不要恢复法伦的道路过路费和税收。",

Betha is more than willing to share her positive opinion about Rolant (and how he has changed recently), and if the characters ask what might have changed him, the only thing she can think of is adopting Rose. She insists the characters investigate. If the characters want to haggle or insist on further payment for the errand, she informs them that The Outrageous Pig is the only inn for miles, and she won't give them a room if they won't help.": "贝莎邀请角色们免费用餐，条件是他们要处理一个小任务：她一直希望一些看起来能干的外来者能提醒罗兰特·乔斯（{@creature commoner}，受到{@creature vitebriate|GHLoE}*，罗斯的支配）费伦的税收是一个严重的不公，只给他送去他点的一部分餐点。贝莎很乐意分享她对罗兰特的正面看法（以及他最近的改变），如果角色们问起是什么改变了他，她唯一能想到的就是领养了罗斯。她坚持让角色们去调查。如果角色们想要讨价还价或坚持要求更多报酬，她会告诉他们，狂野猪酒馆是唯一的一家酒店，如果他们不愿意帮忙，她就不会给他们房间。",
	"She's serious about the food and the room; once the characters agree to help, she sells them two or three discounted rooms (two beds per room) at a rate of 3 sp per room along with the promise that if they figure out what's wrong with Rolant, she'll comp the rooms entirely.": "她对食物和房间很认真；一旦角色们同意帮忙，她以每间房3 sp的优惠价格出售给他们两到三间打折房间（每间房有两张床），并承诺如果他们找出Rolant出了什么问题，她会免费提供房间。",

In the spythronar and skinweaver sections, spiderwebbing is prevalent on walls and ceilings and make the floors tacky.": "洞穴没有自然光源，所以只有最初的洞口有阳光。三个洞穴区域之间的隧道很狭窄，只有小型生物（如龙裔）可以直立行走，而更大的生物需要挤过去。洞穴潮湿凉爽，墙壁和地面光滑。在斯派斯罗纳(`spythronar`)和皮编者(`skinweaver`)区域，蜘蛛网普遍覆盖在墙壁和天花板上，使地面变得粘乎乎的。",
	"At least once a day, a pair of kobolds (whoever draws the short straws) must bring their latest catch, whether livestock or humanoid, to the skinweaver. Doing so is dangerous both for the capricious nature of the skinweaver and because of the spythronar in the caves between—both the skinweaver and the spythronar sometimes take a kobold as a meal. The kobolds have not dared to bring a separate offering to feed the spythronar, being more afraid of the skinweaver's knives.": "每天至少一次，一对龙裔（谁抽到了短签）必须将他们最新捕获的猎物，无论是牲畜还是人类，带给皮织者。这样做既因为皮织者的反复无常，也因为洞穴中间的斯派斯罗纳尔。皮织者和斯派斯罗纳尔有时会把龙裔当作一顿饭。龙裔们不敢另外带食物来喂斯派斯罗纳尔，更害怕皮织者的刀。",
	"Beyond the partially barricaded mouth, this cave opens to vaulted ceilings. A large cooking fire burns brightly in the center of the space. Two openings lead deeper into the cave system to the north and east.": "在部分被栅栏挡住的入口之后，这个洞穴通向拱形的天花板。一个大篝火在空间中央明亮地燃烧着。两个通道向北和东深入洞穴系统。",
	"Six {@creature Morbus Kobold|GHLoE|morbus kobolds}* are ringing the fire, telling stories instead of paying attention to the cave entrance. Their passive Perception is 6. A fight here draws the attention of the kobolds sleeping in {@area area 3|07b|x}, who arrive as soon as they can. They travel through area 2 to reach area 1 to avoid the pit trap.": "六名{@creature Morbus Kobold|GHLoE|morbus kobolds}正在围着篝火，讲故事而不是注意洞穴入口。 他们的被动感知为6。 在这里发生战斗会吸引{@area area 3|07b|x}中正在睡觉的龙人的注意，他们会尽快赶到。 他们会穿过区域2到达区域1，以避开陷阱坑。",
	"The northern exit to this chamber is trapped. A concealed 10-foot-square spiked pit trap, is on area 1's side of the opening. Passive Perceptions of 15 or higher detect it just before stepping on it; a successful DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check while looking for traps find it as well.

	"This chamber reeks of rotting waste. A large depression in the center buzzes and writhes with the sounds and movements of thousands of insects feasting on the assembled dung and trash. Four crude wooden cages are arrayed on the far side. Three tunnels and an opening lead beyond.": "这个房间散发着腐烂废物的恶臭。中央的一个大凹陷处充斥着成千上万的昆虫在啃食堆积的粪便和垃圾时发出的声音和动作。远处摆放着四个粗糙的木笼。三个隧道和一个开口通向远方。",
	"The lavatory pit is smelly and gross but not dangerous. The cages contain at least two sheep and a single humanoid prisoner. If the characters have been sent to find and rescue anyone, all but one of the NPCs they've been sent to rescue are in the cages. The last prisoner is in {@area area 7|08b|x}. Any prisoners here are suffering from two levels of {@condition exhaustion} from malnutrition and have 1 hp.": "厕所坑很臭很脏，但并不危险。笼子里至少有两只羊和一个人类囚犯。如果角色被派去寻找和营救任何人，除了一个NPC外，他们被派去营救的所有人都在笼子里。最后一个囚犯在{@area area 7|08b|x}。这里的任何囚犯都因营养不良而受到{@condition exhaustion}的惩罚，并且只有1点生命值。",

	"The stench of malodorous sweat fills this cave. Clusters of rough sleeping mats are radially arranged around an enormous stalagmite pillar in the center. The pillar has been carved to resemble a strange, malformed creature. A few battered crates serve as footlockers for the creatures who dwell here. Two tunnels lead east, larger tunnel grades downward to the north, and a larger opening leads south.": "这个洞穴充满了难闻的汗臭味。粗糙的睡垫成团地围绕着中央的巨大石笋柱排列着。这根柱子被雕刻成一个奇怪而畸形的生物。几只破旧的板条箱被用作这里居住的生物的储物柜。两条隧道通向东方，较大的隧道向北方倾斜，一个更大的开口通向南方。",

Large cocoons, some intact and some ripped open, hint at the hungry nature of the cavern's inhabitants.": "这个宽敞的洞穴被无处不在的蛛网所遮蔽：墙壁、天花板和地板都被苍白蛛网的触须所覆盖。一些巨大的茧，有些完整，有些被撕开，暗示了洞穴里生物的贪婪本性。",
	"The webs are tacky, making the floor (and walls and ceiling) here {@book difficult terrain|PHB|8|Difficult Terrain}. One {@creature spythronar swarm|GHLoE}* is concealed in normal webs on the ceiling at the northwest end of the chamber.

	"Emerging from the tunnel, you find yourself in a forest of leather strips and webbing. Spider webs crisscross with patches and strands of leather, making it difficult to see more than a few feet. The strands are attached to the ceiling and form an opaque mass before you, like an overabundance of fabric fringe.": "走出隧道，你发现自己置身于一片由皮条和蜘蛛网构成的森林中。蜘蛛网与皮条的碎片和细丝交织在一起，使得你很难看清超过几英尺的距离。这些细丝连接到天花板上，在你面前形成了一团不透明的团块，就像是过多的织物流苏。",
	"The skinweaver set up this blind as an early warning system for itself. The leather and webbing move only when disturbed (there is no breeze this far into the caves), disturbing the skinweaver's webs, alerting it to a visitor or intruder. If the characters move directly forward through it or follow the wall to their right, they end up in the skinweaver's chamber. If they follow the wall to the left instead, they find one of the narrow tunnels leading to the tanning chamber in {@area area 8|091|x}.": "皮织者为自己设置了这个盲点，作为一种早期警报系统。只有在被打扰时，皮革和蛛丝才会移动（这么深入洞穴里没有风）。这会扰乱皮织者的蛛网，提醒它有访客或入侵者。如果角色直接穿过或沿着右边的墙前进，他们会来到皮织者的房间。如果他们选择沿着左边的墙前进，他们会找到通往{@area area 8|091|x}的一个狭窄隧道。",
	"Characters particularly worried about being ambushed in the blind may want to try hacking their way through it or burning it. Hacking is reasonably effective (though slow). Each strand of webbing acts as webbing: AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage. The leather is similar: AC 12; hp 7; vulnerability to acid damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage. Destroying a web and a leather section exposes and clears a 5-foot-square section of the blind. If the characters take more than three rounds to clear the blind or move through it, the skinweaver attacks them through the blind. Because of its web-connections, treat the skinweaver as having {@sense blindsight} against any characters in contact with the blind.": "特别担心在盲目中被伏击的角色可能想尝试砍破它或点燃它。砍砍是相当有效的（尽管慢）。每根蛛丝作为蛛丝：AC 10; hp 5; 易受火焰伤害；免疫钝击、毒素和精神伤害。皮革类似：AC 12; hp 7; 易受酸性伤害；免疫钝击、毒素和精神伤害。摧毁一根蛛丝和一块皮革部分会暴露和清除盲目的一个5英尺正方形区域。如果角色花费超过三轮来清除盲目或穿过它，皮织者会通过盲目攻击他们。由于其蛛网连接，对于与盲目接触的任何角色，将皮织者视为具有{@sense blindsight}(skinweaver)。",
	"Aside from the grotesque splotches of spider web, this cave looks like the most opulent of bedrooms. Leather tapestries hang on the walls and from the high ceiling; a large crude statue of malformed monstrosity peers out from the north wall; a circular mattress rests on a frame of webbing and leather suspended from the ceiling; and bookcases, wardrobes, and mirrors all give the impression of culture and refinement. Atop a three-tiered dais rests a large throne made of different-colored leather strips.": "除了那些令人作呕的蜘蛛网斑点外，这个洞穴看起来像是最奢华的卧室。皮革挂毯悬挂在墙壁和高高的天花板上；一尊畸形怪物的粗糙雕像从北墙上凝视着；一个圆形床垫悬挂在由蜘蛛网和皮革构成的床架上；书架、衣柜和镜子都给人以文化和精致的印象。在一个三层台阶上放着一个由不同颜色的皮条制成的大宝座。",
	"This is the skinweaver's inner sanctum. If not for how all the clothing and furniture is sized for a Large creature with several more limbs than the average humanoid, it could pass for a royal bedroom suite. All the shine is from bronze and brass, however, not gold or silver. Unless it has been fetched by the kobolds to deal with threats elsewhere, the characters probably run into the {@creature skinweaver|GHLoE}* and three {@creature morbus kobold|GHLoE}* attendants here. The kobolds recently brought a victim for the skinweaver to flay and eat, and they receive new orders as the characters arrive.": "这是皮匠的内密室。如果不是所有的衣物和家具都是为一个拥有比普通人类更多肢体的大型生物量身定制的话，这里几乎可以被当作皇家卧室套房。所有的光泽都来自青铜和黄铜，而不是金或银。除非被狗头人带去应对其他威胁，人物们很可能会在这里遇到{@creature skinweaver|GHLoE}*和三个{@creature morbus kobold|GHLoE}*侍从。狗头人最近带来了一个受害者供皮匠剥皮和食用，他们在人物到达时接到新的命令。",

Metal tables covered in a wide range of tools and hides in various stages of tanning interweave between the vats.": "这个房间异常闷热，充斥着刺鼻、令人眼泪汪汪、灼烧肺部的空气。半打大型金属桶中传出嘶嘶声、爆裂声和咝咝声，每个桶里装满了液体。一排金属架连接在东墙上，足够大，可以束缚一个人类大小的生物。金属桌子上摆放着各种工具和处于不同鞣制阶段的兽皮。",
	"If the characters were sent to rescue someone, they find their quarry here, {@condition unconscious} but stable (0 hp) and strapped to the metal rack. Some of the NPC's skin has been removed with surgical precision in disturbing patches of specific shapes; from a distance, these patches appear as monochromatic red tattoos.

They are dry grimoires with no literary value or illustrations. Only one book on the shelves stands out from the rest: The Mad Treatise. When the bloodbonded hits a dead end in its summoning attempts, it spends some time adding to its experimental log.

If the characters have been contracted to rescue captives (or if they merely witnessed a kidnapping and set out to track the abductors), freeing the prisoners in the cages and getting them to safety qualifies as success as well. If the prisoners are killed (perhaps in a failed hostage negotiation), that reflects poorly on the characters. Similarly, the bloodbonded's closest followers (the commoners) are brainwashed. To earn the most respect from their employers, the characters should allow as few commoners as possible to perish defending their monstrous leader.": "消灭血契是确保其教众不再干扰文明的唯一方法。赶走它只是一个半成品。如果角色们被承包去解救被俘者（或者他们只是目睹了一起绑架案并出发追踪绑匪），解救囚犯并将他们安全带走也算是成功。如果囚犯被杀害（也许是在一次失败的人质谈判中），那会给角色们抹上污点。同样地，血契的最亲密追随者（平民）都被洗脑了。为了赢得雇主最大的尊重，角色们应该尽量避免让平民在保卫他们的怪物领袖时丧生。",
	"Depending on which path led the characters to the ruins, this can start several other adventures: perhaps the temple was built over a dungeon even more ancient than the ruins, and some of the cultists flee into its depths with a prisoner. Perhaps this bloodbonded, with its dying breath, reveals that its plans are already in motion and its death won't stop them—what could those plans be? Other, more powerful bloodbonded may still be out there, and tracking them down to save a church or temple the characters value could also be a follow-up!": "根据角色们前往废墟的路径不同，这可能引发其他几个冒险：也许这座寺庙是建在比废墟更古老的地牢之上，一些教徒带着囚犯逃入地牢深处。也许这位血契者在垂死之际透露，它的计划已经在进行中，它的死亡不会阻止这些计划——这些计划可能是什么？其他更强大的血契者可能仍然存在，追踪他们以拯救角色们珍视的教堂或寺庙也可以是一个后续冒险！",

For a mile in any given direction, the sun is as pale as a cloud-shrouded moon, and, beneath even the slightest shade, total darkness reigns. Trees and plants have begun to wither, and docile animals have fled the area in droves, driven away by the persistent darkness.

The northern area of the cavern is largely static, but if the characters delay too long in {@area area 2|16e|x}, two {@creature Mjork Sootling Swarm|GHLoE|sootling swarms}* climb from the pit and harass them. The {@creature mjork charger|GHLoE}* in {@area area 7|184|x} is on patrol across the southern area. Exceptionally loud noise (as from a {@spell thunderwave} or {@spell knock} spell) draws the charger to almost any location in the mine in {@dice 2d4} rounds.": "矿井异常炎热。尽管岩石表面不会造成伤害，但里面异常温暖，就像桑拿房内一样。长时间暴露在没有缓冲或冷却的情况下，角色会以每八小时一个等级的速度积累{@condition exhaustion}等级。空气又闷又烟熏，即使在没有mjorks的区域也是如此。洞穴的北部区域基本静止，但如果角色在{@area area 2|16e|x}中拖延太久，会有两只{@creature Mjork Sootling Swarm|GHLoE|sootling swarms}*从坑中爬出来骚扰他们。{@area area 7|184|x}中的{@creature mjork charger|GHLoE}*正在南部区域巡逻。异常响亮的噪音（比如来自{@spell thunderwave}或{@spell knock}法术）会在{@dice 2d4}回合内将冲锋者吸引到矿井中的几乎任何位置。",

Built near a large settlement, readily supplied with sundries and patrons, it's far enough from civilization that the powers-that-be didn't need to be threatened by its presence. The citadel was devoted with religious fervor to one pursuit: curses. The priests and mages who built the citadel did so through the favors of the common people: curses in exchange for a year of service building, guarding, maintaining, or cooking for the stronghold. Of course, payment in Shadowsteel or sufficient gold was also acceptable, allowing the rich to buy their curses as the poor pledged their service.": "在龙的到来之前，这座山寨是一个公开的秘密。建在一个大型定居点附近，供应充足，有许多顾客，离文明社会足够远，以至于当权者不需要为其存在感到威胁。这座城堡被宗教狂热地奉献给了一个追求：诅咒。建造这座城堡的神职人员和法师是通过普通人民的恩惠来完成的：以诅咒换取一年的建造、守卫、维护或为山寨烹饪的服务。当然，用暗影钢或足够的黄金支付也是可以接受的，这使得富人可以购买他们的诅咒，而穷人则可以用他们的服务来换取。",
	"Then Chuldroth, a young blightscale dragon, driven mad by his ruined body and knowing distantly of the citadel's work with curses (and blaming it for his condition), attacked it.

	"There are three easy reasons the characters may be investigating the Shadowsteel Citadel. First, a powerful figure in the nearby city may have sought a curse, but found the entrance blocked—such a figure may hire the characters to investigate.

The ilharans have built a small worship space and created an enchanted playground for their darling ithjars to frolic in. They are about to achieve their grandest goal: the stormborn ithjar who roosts here has lain eggs. The ilharans have taken great pains to make sure that the roost is safe—even from curious members of their own sect—and are awaiting the hatchlings. Wild animals have taken over the nearby ruins, but through long months of confrontation, the ilharans stay out of the ruins and the beasts don't venture into the ilharans' sanctuary.": "很久以前，崇拜者们建造了一个神庙和神龛，他们将神想象成了龙的形象。这座神庙和神龛早已废弃，但一群潘加伊安伊尔哈兰人发现了这些废墟，并将它们改造为自己的用途：吸引和保护风暴之生伊斯亚。伊尔哈兰人建造了一个小型的礼拜空间，并为他们心爱的伊斯亚们创造了一个魔法游乐场。他们即将实现他们最伟大的目标：在这里栖息的风暴之生伊斯亚已经产下了蛋。伊尔哈兰人费尽心思确保这个栖息地是安全的——甚至对他们自己教派中好奇的成员也保持警惕，并正在等待幼崽的孵化。野生动物已经占据了附近的废墟，但通过长时间的对抗，伊尔哈兰人避开了废墟，野兽也不会冒险进入伊尔哈兰人的圣地。",
	"The ilharans' plans are at odds with civilized society: hungry ithjar (both regular and stormborn) have been raiding roads and farms for decades, but lately they've grown bolder, wiping out villages and even attacking fortified settlements and castles. The characters have been hired by the governor or regent of the region to find the ithjar lair and wipe out the threat. Diviners have tracked the ithjar to the Storm Sanctuary, and now the characters must take them on. Alternatively, the characters may need an ithjar egg for a ritual, craft, or contract. Their efforts to locate an egg ultimately lead them to the Storm Sanctuary.": "伊尔哈兰人的计划与文明社会背道而驰：饥饿的伊斯贾（包括普通和风暴之生）数十年来一直在掠夺道路和农场，但最近它们变得更加大胆，摧毁村庄，甚至攻击设防的定居点和城堡。人物们受雇于该地区的总督或摄政王，以找到伊斯贾的巢穴并消灭威胁。占卜者已经追踪到伊斯贾的位置在风暴圣所，现在人物们必须应对它们。或者，人物们可能需要一枚伊斯贾蛋用于仪式、工艺或契约。他们努力寻找蛋的过程最终将他们带到风暴圣所。",
	"The Storm Sanctuary is high in the forested mountains and surrounded by natural formations and artificial constructions; many partitions close off parts of the Storm Sanctuary from other areas.

	"Through interaction and diplomacy, the characters may shift Arial and her peers' attitude to indifferent. Doing so avoids combat with the panjaians (for now) and even means they'll share an important secret: no one can see the ithjars now because the key to the gate that leads to their nests was lost in the ruins to the north (and flying or climbing enrages the ithjar).": "通过互动和外交，角色们可以改变阿丽尔（Arial）和她的同伴们的态度，使其变得漠不关心。这样做可以避免与潘加人（panjaians）发生战斗（暂时），甚至意味着他们会分享一个重要的秘密：现在没有人能看到伊斯贾（ithjars），因为通往它们巢穴的门的钥匙在北部的废墟中丢失了（而飞行或攀爬会激怒伊斯贾）。",
	"Characters who manage to do particularly well in negotiations may even be able to shift Arial (if not her peers') to a friendly attitude.

Picking the lock requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check.": "最简单的方法是用钥匙(见区域 4)。强行打开大门需要对其造成 20 点伤害(AC 17, 伤害阈值 5, 40 hp)，但每次对其造成伤害时，会产生回响，制造一股冲击波，对门口 20 英尺半径内的生物造成 7 ({@dice 2d6}) 点雷属性伤害。这会提醒伊萨尔(和潘加伊人)有人正在闯入大门。大门几乎不可能攀爬，需要成功通过 DC 20 力量 ({@skill Athletics}) 检定。周围的悬崖可以更容易攀爬。撬锁需要成功通过 DC 15 敏捷 (盗贼工具) 检定。",
	"A small pool of water collects at the base of a ten-foot waterfall before trickling away into the rocks behind. A series of small cairns have been constructed on the path beside the water. The path ascends to the north and descends to the south.": "在一个十英尺高的瀑布底部聚集了一小池水，然后缓缓流入后面的岩石中。一系列小石堆被建造在水边的小径上。路径向北上升，向南下降。",
	"The cairns were built by the panjaian pilgrims before the gate key was lost. Three {@creature Ithjar|GHLoE|ithjars}* sunbathe on the rocks above the waterfall, keeping an eye on the pool below.

	"The stormborn ithjar rests during the day but hunts briefly during the nighttime hours. Characters who wait for nightfall have a chance to steal the eggs without fighting the stormborn ithjar (if that's their objective).

Over time, as the city's power began to wane, the necropolis was sealed and forgotten.": "在这座城市辉煌和强大的巅峰时期，地下建造了一个死者之城，用来纪念这座城市尊贵的战争亡者和那位在战斗中英勇领导他们军队的将军。随着时间的推移，随着这座城市的力量开始衰落，这座死者之城被封闭并被遗忘。",
	"Now, as the city's future is uncertain, a young and ambitious necromancer has rediscovered the Sardonyx Necropolis, so named for the rare and precious red and white marble and gemstones decorating the central mausoleum. In his quest to enhance his city's power, the necromancer began animating the dead, whose corpses have lain undisturbed for so long. Unfortunately for him, his power was insufficient to control them, and now the city above is attacked each night by bands of roving undead soldiers wearing, horrifically enough, the tattered remnants of the city's own uniforms from its glory days.": "如今，随着城市未来的不确定性，一位年轻而雄心勃勃的死灵法师重新发现了红白大理石和宝石装饰的中央陵墓，被称为Sardonyx Necropolis。在他追求增强城市力量的过程中，这位死灵法师开始让长眠已久的尸体复活。不幸的是，他的力量不足以控制它们，现在城市上方每晚都会受到漫游的不死士兵的袭击，他们身穿着城市昔日辉煌时期的制服残余，这让人感到恐怖。",
	"As the city panics, the characters are brought in to deal with the threat. The city's leadership has been reminded of the Sardonyx Necropolis's existence, but the city's watch has its hands full guarding the sewers, caves, and basements where the undead have broken through to the surface. Adventurers are needed to descend to the necropolis, destroy the undead, and stop whoever is causing the problem.": "当城市陷入恐慌时，角色们被召集来应对威胁。城市的领导被提醒了(`Sardonyx Necropolis`)的存在，但城市的守卫正忙着守护下水道、洞穴和地下室，那里的不死生物已经冲出地面。冒险者们需要下到地下墓地，消灭不死生物，并阻止造成问题的人。",
	"Alternatively, the necropolis may still be sealed, but important people (perhaps including the characters) are receiving horrifying visions of the dead rising from their graves and destroying the city. The visions all end with an image of a red-and-white stone structure embossed with sardonyx stones. Research in the city library reveals the existence of the necropolis, and the characters must go there to confront the source of the visions before the worst comes to pass. If your adventures have taken your characters far from any city, feel free instead to put this necropolis above the first level of a dungeon or just below a ruined wilderness temple.": "或者，尸城可能仍然被封闭，但重要人物（也许包括角色）正在接收到恐怖的幻象，看到死者从坟墓中复活并摧毁城市。所有幻象都以一个镶嵌有红白色石头的石结构的形象结束。在城市图书馆的研究中发现了尸城的存在，角色们必须前往那里，面对幻象的源头，以免灾难降临。如果你的冒险使你的角色远离任何城市，可以考虑将这座尸城放置在地牢的第一层之上，或者就在一座废弃的野外神庙下方。",
	"The necropolis is underground, where natural light never penetrates. While there are torch sconces and braziers for oil spread throughout the area, none are stocked. Characters who put torches in the sconces or oil in the braziers and light them draw the undead like moths to a flame. Clever characters may use this strategy to draw undead where they want them, but since the dead are drawn to the light, they may get more than they bargain for! Descriptions assume the characters have some way to see but not necessarily in color.": "这座地下墓地里，自然光线无法渗透。虽然墓地里到处都有炬台和油炉，但都是空的。角色们如果把火把放在炬台上或在油炉里加油点燃，就会像飞蛾扑火一样吸引不死生物。聪明的角色可以利用这个策略把不死生物引到他们想要的地方，但由于亡者被光线吸引，他们可能会得到更多的东西，超出他们的预期！描述假设角色们有某种方式可以看见，但不一定是彩色的。",
	"Without a necromancer controlling them, most of the dead are listless; they \"patrol\" a small area around their graves but lack a sense of past or future that would cause them to change that routine without outside stimuli. If using the city-under-siege model, the characters should not have time to descend at night but should be strongly encouraged to enter during the day. If they spend too long, the corpse walkers gather the undead hordes and lead them to the surface to pillage and destroy—possibly creating even more undead—before returning to the necropolis.": "没有一个死灵法师控制，大多数死者都是无精打采的；他们会在自己坟墓周围的一个小区域“巡逻”，但缺乏过去或未来的感知，这使得他们没有改变这种例行活动的动力。如果采用城市被围困的模式，角色们晚上没有时间下去，但应该在白天被强烈鼓励进入。如果他们停留时间太长，尸体行者会聚集不死军团，带领他们到地面上掠夺和摧毁——可能会制造更多的不死生物——然后返回到死城。",
	"The natural caverns you've traversed give way to precisely worked cobblestones, a twenty-foot-wide road leading to an enormous stone structure, studded with gemstones, that is covered in angular depictions of soldiers drilling, angels floating, and families crying. Gravestones are spaced to the north and south.": "你穿过的天然洞穴让位给精心铺设的鹅卵石路，一条宽二十英尺的道路通向一个巨大的石头建筑，镶嵌着宝石，上面刻满了士兵操练、飘浮的天使和哭泣的家庭的角形图案。墓碑分布在北部和南部。",

	"Though the structure is magnificent, some expense was spared in its construction: only one in every 10 gemstones that sparkle on the structure are real sardonyx, worth 50 gp each. The rest are colored glass baubles. Characters proficient with jeweler's tools or glassblower's tools notice the difference immediately if attempting to remove one from the wall; otherwise, there is only a 10 percent chance that a given gemstone is real. There are 100 stones across each of the three entrances to the necropolis's main structure, 10 of which are real in each case. Prying a stone from the wall takes 5 minutes and an appropriate tool (such as a crowbar or piton and hammer). Glass fakes shatter after a minute of attempted extraction.": "尽管这座建筑的结构壮观，但在其建造过程中有一些节约成本：在这座建筑上闪耀的每10颗宝石中，只有1颗是真正的红玛瑙，价值50 gp。其余的都是有色玻璃小玩意。熟练使用珠宝工具或玻璃吹制工具的角色在试图从墙上取下一颗宝石时立即注意到区别；否则，每颗宝石是真实的概率只有10%。每个入口通向陵墓主结构的入口上有100颗宝石，每种情况下有10颗是真实的。从墙上撬下一颗宝石需要5分钟和适当的工具（如撬棍或铁钉和锤子）。有色玻璃仿品在尝试取出一分钟后会破碎。",

	"The statue depicts Julara, an angel of health and former servant of Aurelia (now an ally of Miklas). Characters who clear off the fungus from the base of the statue discover a plate inscribed with the following prayer: \"Julara, angel of health, protect us from disease and death.\" The blessing of Julara is potent: cleaning the statue grants characters who participate in the cleaning advantage on saves against disease while in the necropolis.": "这座雕像描绘了朱拉拉(Julara)，一位健康天使，曾是奥蕾利亚(Aurelia)的仆人（现在是米克拉斯(Miklas)的盟友）。清除雕像底座上的真菌的角色会发现一块铭刻有以下祷文的盘子：“朱拉拉，健康天使，保护我们免受疾病和死亡之苦。” 朱拉拉的祝福是强大的：清洁雕像的角色在城市中参与清洁将获得在城市内抵抗疾病的豁免检定的优势。",
	"Closer inspection (and knowledge) can reveal that what appears to be fungus is really a yellow, disease-bearing moss. Druids and those proficient with {@skill Medicine} automatically recognize it. Others must succeed at a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check to discern that the spongy stuff is really moss infected with the Weeping Pox. Physical contact with the moss is sufficient to spread it (though if this contact is in service of cleaning the statue, the character gains advantage on their checks against the disease!).": "更仔细的检查（和了解）可以揭示，看似真菌实际上是一种黄色、携带疾病的苔藓。德鲁伊和那些精通{@skill Medicine}的人会自动认出它。其他人必须在智力检定 DC 15（{@skill Nature}）成功后才能辨别出这种海绵状物实际上是感染了哭泣痘的苔藓。与苔藓接触就足以传播它（尽管如果这种接触是为了清洁雕像，角色在对抗这种疾病的检定中获得优势！）。",

There are two lindwyrms under the Thundering Hills.": "数代传说中都提到雷鸣山脉下方有隆隆声。故事随着时间的推移而变化，但有一点永远不变：总会有一只名为林德温龙(lindwyrm)的巨兽，它是一只拥有一对爪子和无尽食欲的巨蛇。传说说，当林德温龙苏醒时，毁灭总会随之而来。但这些故事是错误的。雷鸣山脉下有两只林德温龙。",
	"Digging through the earth, the Lickscale kobold tribe came across the vast beasts and took to worshipping the century-long sleeping monstrosities. The kobolds piled small offerings around the mated pair in hopes that when they awoke, the draconic creatures grant blessings and favor to the tribe. A few weeks ago, two-thirds of the tribe was eaten the first day the pair woke, but that didn't stop the kobolds. The tribe brought more offerings, capturing wild game, farmers, and livestock to appease the lindwyrm pair which, with their hunger sated, began to tolerate the kobolds. Other than a few raids of their own against nearby villages or farms, the lindwyrms have turned their attention toward their hatching eggs.

The Tolfersons were popular and the eldest son, Ulfrick Snow-Swimmer, was a local hero for saving two children from drowning when they feel through the ice. The adventurers are begged to follow the tracks, rescue the family, and wreck a terrible vengeance upon those who would raid the clan. Many whisper of creatures beneath the Thundering Hills, but the folk tales are rarely consistent beyond claiming a huge feral beast sleeps beneath there, its snores or restless sleep making the hills shake.": "利克鳞族袭击了一座农场，绑架了农民，并带走了牲畜。附近的渔民听到了骚动，但当他们赶到时，托尔弗森家族已经被带走了。从雪地上的足迹可以清楚地看出，一些类人生物袭击了农场，而且至少有些家庭成员在被带走时还活着。托尔弗森一家很受欢迎，长子乌尔弗里克·雪泳者是当地的英雄，曾经救过两个孩子从冰面上掉下去。冒险者们被恳求跟踪这些足迹，解救这个家庭，并对那些袭击家族的人进行可怕的报复。许多人低声议论着雷鸣山下的生物，但民间传说很少一致，只是声称有一只巨大的野兽在那里沉睡，它的打呼声或不安的睡眠让山丘颤抖。",

Felled logs form a rough barrier on each side of the path, slowing plant growth over the path.": "在这片死胎森林的这一区域，茂密的橡树和松树林立。然而，当你旅行时，你会注意到一些变化：道路一侧的树木稀疏了一些，看起来病态且落叶凋零。更少的森林生物从它们的巢穴和栖息地向你叽叽喳喳。被砍伐的原木在道路两侧形成了粗糙的屏障，减缓了道路上的植物生长。",
	"In the distance, on either side of the path, are a pair of wooden structures. Although they are difficult to see through the thick foliage, you can discern a few details. The structure to the west of the path, on the same side as the sickly trees, has obviously sustained structural damage. The structure on the eastern side of the path is in better shape.": "在路径的两侧远处，有一对木结构。虽然它们很难穿过浓密的树叶看清楚，但你可以辨认出一些细节。在路径西侧的结构，与那些病树同侧，显然已经遭受了结构性的损坏。而在路径东侧的结构状况较好。",
	"The characters get a better view only if they approach or use magic. The current lull in the battle between Krumm's contingent and the xakalonuses means there's nothing to hear from the road.": "只有当角色靠近或使用魔法时才能获得更好的视野。目前克鲁姆(Krumm)的队伍和夏卡洛努斯(xakalonuses)之间的战斗平静下来，意味着从道路上听不到任何声音。",
	"A successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check identifies tracks of Medium-sized and booted humanoid creatures, along with some domesticated animals like horses. More recent tracks to and from the area were made by xakalonuses, which look like large wolf tracks but with much sharper claws.": "一次成功的感知检定（智力 DC 15）可以识别到中等体型并穿着靴子的人形生物的足迹，还有一些像马这样的驯养动物的足迹。最近往来于这个区域的足迹是由夏卡洛努斯（xakalonuses）留下的，它们的足迹看起来像是大型狼的足迹，但爪子更加锋利。",
	"If the characters take a moment to examine the corrupted trees along the west of the path, they can attempt a DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Nature}) check. On a success, they learn that these trees were at one point magical, infused with a type of fey magic. Something drained the magic from them, leaving them alive but severely damaged.": "如果角色们花一点时间检查路径西侧的腐化树木，他们可以尝试进行一次DC 20智力检定({@skill Arcana}或{@skill Nature})。成功的话，他们会发现这些树曾经是魔法的，充满了某种精灵魔法。某种力量抽取了它们的魔法，让它们依然存活，但严重受损。",
	"The magic of the trees was drained by the presence of the xakalonuses as they moved through the area recently. Unless the characters have explicit knowledge of the xakalonus, however, they have no way of knowing their presence was the cause of this corruption of the trees. However, when the characters see magic fail to affect those creatures, they might figure it out.": "树木的魔力被最近经过该地区的夏卡洛努斯所耗尽。除非角色们明确知道夏卡洛努斯，否则他们无法知道这种腐蚀树木的原因是它们的存在。然而，当角色们看到魔法无法影响这些生物时，他们可能会推断出来。",
	"Two sets of five {@creature Xakalonus|GHLoE|xakalonuses}* each wait to the north and south of the Krumm's Manor ({@area Area 3|39a|x}). They watch the situation, waiting for the hraptnon to arrive and take part in a final assault against the occupants of the manor. The characters' presence throws their plan into question. If the characters notice either of these sets of monsters and attack, the group of xakalonuses they attack defends themselves.": "两组各有五个{@creature Xakalonus|GHLoE|xakalonuses}*的怪物分别等待在克鲁姆庄园({@area Area 3|39a|x})的北部和南部。它们观察着局势，等待着赫拉普特农到来，参与最后一次对抗庄园居民的攻击。角色的出现打乱了他们的计划。如果角色注意到这两组怪物中的任何一组并发动攻击，他们将自卫反击。",
	"The other group of creatures lingers, waiting to see what happens next. They may be tempted to join any fracas between the characters and Krumm's entourage (see Area 3).": "另一群生物徘徊着，等待看接下来会发生什么。他们可能会被诱惑加入角色和克鲁姆随从之间的混战（见区域3）。",
	"The outer walls and foundation of this dwelling are cracked, the glass windows shattered and the doors torn from their hinges. Three human corpses litter the lawn outside the house.": "这座住宅的外墙和地基裂开，玻璃窗户破碎，门被撬开。三具人类尸体散落在房子外的草坪上。",
	"This building housed Krumm's mundane servants: cooks, farmers, animal keepers, etc. They locked themselves in the building when the xakalonuses attacked, but the monsters entered the building and killed everyone inside, chasing down those who attempted to flee.": "这座建筑是克鲁姆(Krumm)的普通仆人们的住所：厨师、农民、动物看护等。当卡卡洛纳斯(xakalonuses)袭击时，他们把自己锁在建筑里，但怪物进入了建筑并杀死了里面的所有人，追赶那些试图逃跑的人。",
	"A character succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Nature}) check determines that while it looks like the damage to the building was caused by an earthquake, the damage is too localized and specific. Highly concentrated thunder damage was the cause of the damage to the building.": "一个角色在一次DC 15智力检定中成功（{@skill Arcana}或{@skill Nature}）确定，尽管建筑物的损坏看起来像是地震造成的，但损坏过于局部和具体。高度集中的雷电伤害是导致建筑物损坏的原因。",
	"The three corpses in the front lawn belonged to members of Master Krumm's staff: a cook, a farmer, and a woodcutter. A successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check determines that the bodies where slain by claws and bites from a rather larger creature. On the body of the cook is a key, which opens the back door of Krumm's manor.": "前院的三具尸体属于克鲁姆大师的员工：一名厨师，一名农民和一名木匠。成功的DC 15智力检定确定这些尸体是被一只相当大的生物的爪子和咬伤所杀。在厨师的尸体上发现了一把钥匙，可以打开克鲁姆庄园的后门。",
	"Inside the house are more corpses like the ones in the front yard.

Krumm paid well but insisted on secrecy, insisting that Feder tell no one where he was going or who he was serving.": "在过去的两个月里，Krumm和他的大约20人的员工建立了这个小聚居地。现在大部分员工都死在了仆人住所里。Krumm付出了高昂的报酬，但坚持保密，要求Feder不告诉任何人他去了哪里或者为谁服务。",
	"They were attacked today by large wolf-like creatures lacking hair. Their howls shattered windows and buckled doors.": "今天他们遭到了缺乏毛发的大型狼样生物的袭击。它们的嚎叫声打破了窗户，弯曲了门。",
	"Krumm is probably in his manor house, assuming he survived the attack. The Master is a powerful arcanist who sought this remote place to perform his research.": "克鲁姆可能在他的庄园里，假设他在袭击中幸存下来。这位大师是一位强大的奥术师，他选择这个偏远的地方进行研究。",
	"[A successful DC 20 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation} or {@skill Persuasion}) check is needed to prompt the following information.] The staff catches glimpses of strange creatures (the {@creature Chapped Brute|GHLoE|chapped brutes}) moving through the woods, and in and out of the manor house late at night. Occasionally a scream is heard from the manor as well, but no one is brave enough to ask questions or investigate.": "需要成功进行一次 DC 20 魅力检定（{@skill Intimidation} 或 {@skill Persuasion}）才能引出以下信息。工作人员偶尔能看到奇怪生物（{@creature Chapped Brute|GHLoE|chapped brutes}）在树林中穿行，夜晚进出庄园。偶尔还能听到庄园传来尖叫声，但没有人敢于提问或调查。",
	"Unlike the other building, this one is still intact. The bodies of several creatures, looking like some sort of wolf-lizard hybrid, lie dead around the house's perimeter. There are no signs of life within or outside the house.": "与其他建筑不同，这座建筑仍然完好无损。几只看起来像某种狼蜥蜴混合体的生物的尸体散落在房子周围。房子内外都没有生命的迹象。",
	"Master Krumm ({@creature downcast apostate|GHLoE}*) is locked within his home, waiting for the next barrage from the xakalonuses. He is unaware of the presence of the hraptnon nearby, although he knows of its mythical existence and fears that if it attacks, he and his bodyguards won't be able to withstand the assault.

	"Master Krumm's rituals to regain his immortality failed for one simple reason: none of his sacrifices were powerful enough in spirit or magic to ignite the divine spark in him. With the characters, he sees several potential sparks. This leaves him in a quandary: he may need the characters to help hold off further attacks, but if he can kill one to complete the ritual, he can regain immortality, so defending against the attack won't matter.": "克鲁姆大师为了恢复他的不朽失败了，原因很简单：他的牺牲品中没有一个在精神或魔法上足够强大，无法点燃他体内的神圣火花。在这些角色中，他看到了几个潜在的火花。这让他左右为难：他可能需要这些角色来帮助抵御进一步的攻击，但如果他能杀死其中一个来完成仪式，他就可以重获不朽，所以防御攻击就不重要了。",
	"The manor is full of Krumm's personal items, as well as tomes on rituals that could return immortality to once-immortal creatures. Components for those rituals are stored throughout the manor and could be sold for 1,500 gp to the right buyer. In the shed near the garden, three bound woodcutters await their fate as sacrifices to Krumm's ritual.": "这座庄园里堆满了克鲁姆(Krumm)的个人物品，还有关于可以让曾经不朽生物重获不朽的仪式书籍。这些仪式所需的材料分散存放在整个庄园中，可以卖给合适的买家以1,500金币的价格。在花园附近的棚屋里，有三名被捆绑的伐木工等待着作为克鲁姆仪式的牺牲品。",

However, the creature may go after a more accessible target who is almost as powerful.": "当(hraptnon)到达时，它的本能是瞄准那个拥有最强魔法能力的生物。这很可能是(Krumm大师)，他是一名18级的咒术师。然而，这个生物可能会选择攻击一个更容易接近的目标，虽然他们的实力几乎一样强大。",
	"If the hraptnon is being easily handled by the characters, a squad of five {@creature Xakalonus|GHLoE|xakalonuses} enters the fray to support their progenitor.

	"If what could turn into a three-way battle results in the characters' victory, they learn that the foresters' disappearance was caused by both the hraptnon and xakalonuses, as well as the machinations of Master Krumm. Bringing Krumm back to Oakendale for justice settles the affair in the eyes of Yvell, who gratefully provides the promised reward.": "如果导致三方战斗的结果是角色的胜利，他们会发现林务员的失踪是由hraptnon和xakalonuses以及Krumm大师的阴谋所致。将Krumm带回Oakendale接受审判，这样在Yvell的眼中就解决了这件事，Yvell感激地提供了承诺的奖励。",
	"Unfortunately for the characters, unless they find the hraptnon's magical Stillborn Heart at the grove in the center of the Stillborn Forest, a new hraptnon appears within 24 hours of the original's demise. It is likely that the new hraptnon gathers a large force of xakalonuses, and maybe some other deadly forest creatures, and assaults Oakendale directly, hoping to gorge on the brains of any arcane characters.": "不幸的是，除非角色们在(Stillborn Forest)中心的林地找到(hraptnon)的魔法(Stillborn Heart)，否则在原(hraptnon)死亡后的24小时内会出现一个新的(hraptnon)。新的(hraptnon)很可能会聚集大量的(xakalonuses)，也许还有其他致命的森林生物，并直接袭击(Oakendale)，希望能吞食任何奥术角色的大脑。",

Jacoty was reborn as an hourglass widow.": "霍斯肯（Hosken）不得不返回他的家乡在夏诺王国（Charneault Kingdom）处理家庭事务，但在离开后却神秘失踪了。贾科蒂（Jacoty）竭尽全力寻找他失去的爱人，但一切努力都徒劳无功。贾科蒂度过余生为霍斯肯而苦苦相思，内心充满了愧疚和愤怒。当贾科蒂最终因悲伤而死去时，即使在那一刻也无法与他的爱人团聚。贾科蒂转世为沙漏寡妇（hourglass widow）。",
	"As an undead creature that despises hope, Jacoty moves throughout the countryside, snuffing out hope and joy wherever he finds it. He's recently found an opportunity to corrupt the hopes and dreams of a werebear ascetic named Zeragonia. Zeragonia found this region suffused with lycanthropy after a visit from the Great Beast, and she established a cave complex to harbor lycanthropes trying to learn to control their affliction. An acolyte of Miklas, Zeragonia calls upon that Arch Seraph's power to aide her in healing her charges, or at least helping them control themselves.": "作为一个鄙视希望的不死生物，雅科提(Jacoty)在乡间穿行，无论在哪里，他都会扼杀希望和快乐。他最近发现了一个机会，可以腐化一位名叫泽拉戈尼亚(Zeragonia)的狻猊( werebear )苦行者的希望和梦想。泽拉戈尼亚发现这个地区在一次与巨兽的接触后充满了狼人病，她建立了一个洞穴群，用来庇护那些试图控制他们的疾病的狼人。作为米克拉斯(Miklas)的侍僧，泽拉戈尼亚请求这位大天使的力量来帮助她治愈她的病人，或者至少帮助他们控制自己。",
	"When Jacoty learned of Zeragonia's ministrations, he found a new focus for his evil intentions. He wormed his way into Zeragonia's cavern-home, and he is using his powers to subvert Zeragonia and corrupt her followers.

	"Written in code, the journal spans the last two years and talks about Zeragonia's personal struggle with her lycanthropy, how Miklas helped her overcome the affliction, and how she created this place to safely assist others who suffer from lycanthropy to control their more violent instincts. The last entry talks about the arrival of a stranger named Jacoty who seemed troubled. Zeragonia was interested in what those troubles might be, sensing a deeper darkness dwelling within him.": "以代码形式编写，这本日记跨越了过去两年，讲述了Zeragonia与她的狼人病的个人斗争，以及Miklas如何帮助她克服这种病症，以及她是如何创造这个地方来安全地帮助其他患有狼人病的人控制他们更暴力的本能。最后一篇记录谈到了一个名叫Jacoty的陌生人的到来，他似乎心神不宁。Zeragonia对他的困扰感到兴趣，感觉到他内心深处有着更深的黑暗。",

	"The woman is Zeragonia, a {@creature werebear ascetic|GHLoE}*, in her human form. The two flanking her are {@creature Werewolf Ravager|GHLoE|werewolf ravagers}* who've already succumbed to Jacoty's control.

She attacks during the next round unless the characters find a way to help her.": "这位女士是泽拉戈尼亚(Zeragonia)，一位{@creature werebear ascetic|GHLoE}*，她化身为人类形态。两名站在她身旁的是已经被雅科蒂(Jacoty)控制的{@creature Werewolf Ravager|GHLoE|werewolf ravagers}*。当角色们接近神龛时，掠食者们立即发动攻击，但泽拉戈尼亚在战斗的第一回合专注于神龛。除非角色们找到帮助她的方法，否则她会在接下来的回合中发动攻击。",
	"If any of the characters focus on seeing what's happening with Zeragonia, they can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check (no action required). On a success, they see that the woman is highly distressed and confused as she stares at the statue of Miklas.": "如果任何角色专注于观察Zeragonia发生的事情，他们可以尝试进行一次DC 15的感知({@skill Insight})检定（无需行动）。成功的话，他们会发现这位女士看着米克拉斯的雕像，表现出极度的烦躁和困惑。",

In addition, Zeragonia regains her senses and can be convinced into helping the characters fight the rest of the lycanthropes and Jacoty.": "一旦最后一步完成，巢穴的所有魔法停止运作，使得Jacoty的力量减弱，更容易被角色击败。此外，Zeragonia恢复理智，可以被说服帮助角色对抗剩下的狼人和Jacoty。",

	"Floss's Cross was a prosperous hamlet set at the crossroads of two important trade routes. The people of Floss's Cross worked hard to provide the best food, drink, and services to the many travelers who passed through their village, and they grew accustomed to the prosperity that came with a respected reputation. The place earned a high standing among even the most powerful people in Etharis, making it a place where political, religious, social, and economic leaders would meet in secret to discuss, negotiate, barter, entreat, and strategize.": "弗洛斯十字路口（Floss's Cross）是一个繁荣的小村庄，坐落在两条重要贸易路线的交汇处。弗洛斯十字路口的居民努力工作，为经过村庄的众多旅行者提供最好的食物、饮料和服务，并且习惯了与受尊敬声誉相伴的繁荣。这个地方在伊萨瑞斯（Etharis）甚至最有权势的人中间享有很高的声望，成为政治、宗教、社会和经济领袖秘密会面讨论、谈判、交易、恳求和制定战略的地方。",
	"Unfortunately, the hamlet's success and reputation also drew some unwanted attention. An avarice seraph called Rusk and a gluttony seraph called Yort realized that by infiltrating the town, they might be able to corrupt some of the very powerful people who visited Floss's Cross regularly. The pair, along with their lesser disavowed minions, have turned the place into a ticking time bomb.": "不幸的是，这个村庄的成功和声誉也引来了一些不受欢迎的关注。一个名叫拉斯克(Rusk)的贪婪天使和一个名叫约特(Yort)的暴食天使意识到，通过渗透这个城镇，他们也许能够腐化一些经常造访弗洛斯十字镇的非常有权势的人。这对天使，连同他们的次要被否认的手下，已经把这个地方变成了一个不断滋生危机的地方。",
	"They found a way to attract a caprathorn to the area. The potential devastation a caprathorn might cause gives the pair of disavowed leverage over the rich and powerful visitors to the town, and it would certainly bring powerful people to deal with it. Ruck and Yort also hold a powerful hostage in town, and they plan to either kill or corrupt the heroes who come to investigate.": "他们找到了一种方法来吸引一只角羊兽((Caprathorn))来到这个地区。一只角羊兽可能带来的潜在破坏给了这对被否认的人在镇上富有权势的访客身上一些筹码，这肯定会吸引有权势的人前来处理。Ruck和Yort还在镇上扣押了一个有影响力的人质，并计划要么杀死，要么腐蚀那些前来调查的英雄。",
	"A powerful figure in Etharis (or your own world) came to Floss's Cross. Neither they, their bodyguards, nor other members of their retinue have been heard from since they first arrived. The disappearance of such a powerful figure has many people worried. Worse yet, rumors that a dreadful minion of the Great Beast has been hunting in the area stoke those worries. The characters are asked to find out what happened to this powerful figure.": "在埃萨里斯（或你自己的世界）中的一个强大人物来到了弗洛斯十字镇。自从他们最初抵达以来，他们、他们的保镖或其他随行人员都没有消息。这样一个强大人物的失踪让许多人感到担忧。更糟糕的是，有传言称一位大兽的可怕爪牙正在该地区搜寻，这加剧了人们的担忧。人们请求角色们找出这位强大人物发生了什么事情。",

However, all the danger and duplicity the characters find in Floss's Cross radiate out from this central area.

(Adding more interesting elements or enemies to those areas is recommended if you want to lengthen or increase the difficulty of the lair.)": "提供的地图仅显示了弗洛斯十字村的中心。其他商店、企业、酒馆和旅馆都位于村庄中心之外。然而，角色们在弗洛斯十字村发现的所有危险和欺诈都是从这个中心地区辐射出来的。地图上未标号的建筑是空置的住宅，要么是正常居民已经逃离，要么是出租但目前没有租户的建筑。（如果想延长或增加巢穴的难度，建议在这些区域添加更多有趣的元素或敌人。）",

The population of the hamlet has locked themselves in their homes and businesses, waiting for the caprathorn to attack again. The people of the town are unaware that anything untoward is happening in and around the town square—at least in regards to the disavowed taking over and taking a hostage. They've been told to remain in their homes because of the threat of the caprathorn, but they think the problem is being handled.": "市中心已经遭到了卡普拉索恩（Caprathorn）的一次袭击，造成了一些损坏。小镇的居民已经将自己锁在家里和商店里，等待卡普拉索恩再次袭击。镇上的人们并不知道在市中心及周围发生了什么不寻常的事情——至少在被否认接管和劫持人质方面。他们被告知要留在家中，因为卡普拉索恩的威胁，但他们认为问题正在得到处理。",
	"The caprathorn and its minions presently haunt the forested area outside the hamlet. The caprathorn does not approach town until the magic of the Floss Memorial statue (see Area 1) is activated by Rusk or Yort.

	"At the center of town, where the two well-traveled trade routes meet, stands a marble statue depicting a smiling woman, her arms spread wide as if casting a blessing over the entire area.

	"The statue has been magically empowered by the disavowed seraphs Rusk and Yort to act as a beacon for the caprathorn.

	"Not long after the characters enter the building, the diners start suffering the effects of the poison.

They cannot, however, breach the moat and the bridge, so they hurl themselves ineffectively at the barrier, all the while trying to think of other ways to free their mistress.": "本尼坦特(Benitent) 无法永久杀死艾利德拉尼娅(Aeilidrania)，并担心如果摧毁她当前的形态，她只会逃脱。因此，他将这位吸血鬼囚禁在一个由驱护术力量环绕的岛屿上的魔法住所中。这位吸血鬼的许多追随者已经在世界各地搜寻方法来解救他们缺席的主人，但只有少数人找到了这个地方。然而，他们无法突破护城河和桥梁，因此他们无效地投身于障碍物，同时试图想出其他方法来解救他们的女主人。",
	"Benitent is only able to keep this prison intact through the power of a mortal being.

	"For her part, Aeilidrania has given up attempting to escape. She's formed a friendship with the old caretaker, sharing with him much of the knowledge and wisdom she's gathered across the many centuries of her unlife.

After some research and investigation, they hear rumors that the vampire they seek lives in a secluded region far from any civilized areas. Whether or not they learn of the vampire's imprisonment by Benitent, the angel of Empyreus, depends on how much research they undertake and how many resources they use. With no other means of securing the information they need to deal with the incredible threat, the characters are forced to seek out Aeilidrania.": "一个威胁世界的问题正迅速向角色们逼近，而他们需要对抗它的一条信息，却牢牢地掌握在扭曲但聪明的精灵吸血鬼艾莉德拉尼亚的脑海中。经过一番研究和调查，他们听说寻找的吸血鬼居住在远离任何文明地区的隐秘地区。他们是否会得知这位吸血鬼被Empyreus的天使贝尼坦特囚禁的消息，取决于他们进行多少研究和利用了多少资源。在没有其他获得应对巨大威胁所需信息的途径的情况下，角色们被迫寻找艾莉德拉尼亚。",
