	"\"Forgotten Relics\" is a short adventure for a party of four to six 1st-level characters, who advance to 2nd level by the adventure's conclusion. It is set in Sharn and serves as an introduction to the city. A balance of character classes is helpful, since the adventurers will face a variety of challenges.": "\"被遗忘的遗迹 \"是一个简短的冒险，适合四到六个一级角色，在冒险结束时提升到二级。它的背景是沙恩，是对这个城市的介绍。角色等级的平衡是有帮助的，因为冒险者们将面临各种挑战。",
	"Niho Koi, an imposing oni and Daask sub-boss in Sharn, ordered a half-ogre lieutenant named Garra to assemble a team and search the ruins of Old Sharn for arcane relics at the behest of someone much higher up in the organization. With a lot of ground to cover beneath the City of Towers, Garra kidnapped Caden d'Orien, the only son of Alden d'Orien, forcing Alden to use his position in his dragonmarked house to recruit out-of-work warforged—people no one would miss—to scour Old Sharn's ruins. Alden branded the work as a \"secret research-gathering mission\" for his house, paid the warforged workers for their silence, and signed them to binding contracts.": "Niho Koi是沙恩的一个威严的鬼魂和Daask副老板，他命令一个叫Garra的半鬼魂中尉组建一个团队，在组织中更高层的人的授意下，在旧沙恩的废墟中搜索奥术文物。由于塔楼之城下面有很多地方需要覆盖，Garra绑架了Alden d'Orien的独生子Caden d'Orien，迫使Alden利用他在龙纹之家的地位，招募失业的战争锻造者--没有人会错过的人--来搜寻旧沙恩的遗迹。奥尔登将这项工作打造成他家的 \"秘密研究-收集任务\"，为战神工人的沉默支付报酬，并与他们签订了具有约束力的合同。",
	"It took several weeks of dangerous exploring and a few deaths, but eventually the warforged workers found a library of arcane texts and schemas buried in the ruins. These items were moved to a Daask safe house in Tavick's Landing near the Terminus Lightning Rail station. The organization plans to smuggle the relics out Breland to Droaam with Alden's help.": "经过几周的危险探索和几人的死亡，最终战神工人发现了埋藏在废墟中的奥术文本和原理的图书馆。这些物品被转移到了塔维克兰丁（Tavick's Landing）靠近总站闪电铁路站的达斯克安全屋。该组织计划在奥登的帮助下，将这些遗物从布雷兰德偷运到德罗阿姆。",
	"Coal, a destitute warforged hired by Alden, witnessed her good friend Razor die, executed in the ruins of Old Sharn as an example to the other workers. Coal made an appointment to talk to Sergeant Germaine Vilroy of the Sharn Watch, to report the shady operation, Razor's murder, and the kidnapping of the House Orien scion, Caden. Thanks to crooked members of the Sharn Watch in Daask's pocket, Garra found out about the appointment and dispatched killers to prevent Coal from ratting out the operation.": "煤，一个被Alden雇佣的穷困潦倒的战争锻造者，目睹了她的好朋友Razor的死亡，在旧沙恩的废墟上被处决，作为其他工人的榜样。寇尔约好与沙恩守望的杰曼-维尔罗伊中士谈话，报告这个不光彩的行动、雷泽的谋杀以及奥瑞恩家族的子孙凯顿被绑架。多亏了达斯克口袋里的沙恩看守所的腐败成员，加拉发现了这个约会，并派出杀手阻止煤老板告发这次行动。",
	"Germaine is also crooked, but she is on the payroll of the Boromar Clan crime syndicate, whose members are enemies of Daask. Not wanting to put the Sharn Watch or herself between two criminal organizations at war, Germaine called in a few old contacts to meet with Coal and find out what's going on.": "杰曼也是个骗子，但她受雇于博洛玛氏族犯罪集团，其成员是达斯克的敌人。杰曼不想把沙恩观察站或她自己置于两个处于战争状态的犯罪组织之间，她叫来了几个旧的联系人，与煤炭公司见面，了解情况。",

	"The {@book Monster Manual|MM} contains statistics for many of the creatures found in this adventure.

If the stat block appears elsewhere, the adventure's text tells you so.": "{@book Monster Manual|MM}包含了这个冒险中发现的许多生物的统计数据。当一个生物的名字以{@b bold}的字体出现时，那是一个视觉提示，告诉你在{@book Monster Manual|MM}中该生物的状态块。如果状态块出现在其他地方，冒险故事的文字会告诉你。",
	"The adventure begins one evening in Upper Central Plateau, where the characters meet Sergeant Germaine Vilroy, who hires them to meet with a warforged named Coal, hear her out, and bring her back to Vilroy for further questioning. Coal has already been told to wait for the characters at the Cog Carnival, a warforged bar in the High Walls district of Lower's Tavick's Landing.": "冒险开始于上中央高原的一个晚上，人物在那里遇到了Germaine Vilroy中士，后者雇佣他们去见一个叫Coal的战地锻造者，听她说完，并把她带回Vilroy那里进一步审问。煤已经被告知在Cog Carnival等待他们，这是一家位于Lower's Tavick's Landing的High Walls区的warforged酒吧。",
	"After talking to Coal and learning her employer was Alden d'Orien, the characters are confronted by Daask forces sent to kill Coal. If they survive the fight, the characters can meet with Alden in the Mithral Tower district Upper Central Plateau. The scion stays tight-lipped, but Vishtai, Alden's kalashtar bodyguard, telepathically gives the characters directions to the Old Sharn ruin where Caden d'Orien is imprisoned.": "在与Coal交谈并得知她的雇主是Alden d'Orien后，角色们遇到了Daask派来杀死Coal的部队。如果他们在战斗中幸存下来，人物就可以在上中央高原的Mithral塔区与阿尔登见面。这个子孙保持沉默，但阿尔登的卡拉什塔保镖维斯塔伊（Vishtai）以心灵感应的方式向人物提供了前往旧沙恩废墟的方向，凯顿-德奥瑞恩就被囚禁在那里。",
	"Before the adventure begins, inform each character that they are an acquaintance of Sergeant Germaine Vilroy of the Sharn Watch, a Brelish veteran of the Last War. Ask each character to come up with a friendly connection to Germaine, or have them choose or roll on the Germaine Connections table. If a rolled connection doesn't make sense with the character's background, simply roll for a new connection or choose one that seems appropriate.": "在冒险开始前，通知每个角色他们是沙恩守望的杰曼-维尔罗伊中士的熟人，他是最后一次战争中的布雷利什老兵。要求每个角色想出一个与杰曼的友好关系，或者让他们在杰曼关系表上选择或滚动。如果滚出的关系与角色的背景不相符，只需滚出一个新的关系或选择一个看起来合适的关系。",

	"Once the players are ready to begin, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to them:": "一旦玩家准备好开始，就向他们读或转述以下方框内的文字。",
	"An orange glow covers the top of Lyrandar Tower as the sun sinks in the sky. Above, the great airships of House Lyrandar float like leviathans surrounded by brilliant rings of elemental energy. Below, bridges crisscross at all levels of the city, connecting Sharn's great towers. The sounds of crying children, barking vendors, cursing skycoach drivers, and braying hippogriffs rise up to become a unique din that can only be heard in the City of Towers.": "当太阳沉入天空时，橙色的光芒覆盖了Lyrandar塔的顶部。在上面，Lyrandar家族的伟大飞艇像利维坦一样漂浮着，周围是灿烂的元素能量环。在下面，桥梁在城市的各个层面纵横交错，连接着沙恩的大塔。哭闹的孩子、叫卖的小贩、咒骂的空中巴士司机、咆哮的河马等声音此起彼伏，成为只有在塔楼之城才能听到的独特喧嚣。",
	"Each of you carries a letter from your acquaintance Sergeant Germaine Vilroy of the Sharn Watch that reads, \"I'm calling on you for a job. I can't write the details, but it pays well and requires your skills. Meet me at the airship dock on top of Lyrandar Tower. Come armed.\"": "你们每个人都带着一封你们的熟人、沙恩观察所的杰曼-维尔罗伊中士的信，信中写道：\"我向你们征集一份工作。我无法写出细节，但它的报酬很高，而且需要你的技能。在利兰达塔顶的飞艇码头见我。带着武器来。\"",
	"Have the players introduce their characters to each other, if they aren't already acquainted. Ask characters who aren't from Sharn how they arrived, perhaps on an airship (likely paid for by Germaine whose Kundarak account is flush with Boromar gold) or a lightning rail. For characters who are Sharn natives, provide a brief description of various districts that fit the characters' backgrounds if needed using the information in {@book chapter 3|ERLW|8}.": "让玩家们互相介绍自己的角色，如果他们还不熟悉的话。问问那些不是沙恩人的角色，他们是如何到达的，也许是乘坐飞艇（可能是由Germaine支付的，她的Kundarak账户里有大量的Boromar金币）或闪电轨道。对于是沙恩本地人的角色，如果需要的话，用{@book chapter 3|ERLW|8}中的信息对符合角色背景的各个地区进行简要描述。",
	"This is also a good time for characters to make personal connections that might link them, such as having the same birthplace, fighting for the same side in the Last War, or having common backgrounds or interests. Once the characters' relationships to one another have been established, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:": "这也是人物建立可能将他们联系起来的个人联系的好时机，例如有相同的出生地，在最后一次战争中为同一方作战，或者有共同的背景或兴趣。一旦人物之间的关系建立起来，就向玩家宣读或转述以下方框内的文字。",
	"As darkness descends on the city, you see windows light up the towers around you from bottom to top. A cool wind whisks between you, drowning out the other noises of the city. A nearby lift rises, carrying a human in her mid-thirties with close cropped black hair and a glowing pipe in her mouth. Germaine gives a wry smile as she nods to you all, saying, \"Thanks for coming.\"": "当黑暗降临到这座城市时，你看到窗户将你周围的塔楼从下到上照亮。一阵凉爽的风在你们之间呼啸而过，淹没了城市的其他噪音。附近的一部电梯升起，载着一个三十多岁的人类，她紧紧地剪着黑发，嘴里叼着一个发光的烟斗。杰曼给出了一个狡猾的微笑，她向你们所有人点头，说：\"谢谢你们的到来。\"",
	"It seems the Sharn Watch is outsourcing more and more of their jobs to contractors, also known as adventurers, also known as mercenaries, which is what these blood-soaked hirelings are. While many of these second-rate thugs act like they have the absolute authority of the Sharn Watch, know your rights! These sellswords can get away with atrocities, including murder, but only if such crimes are committed in the pursuit of their contracts. Should one of these ruffians steal from or harm you or your loved ones for no reason other than their barbaric attitudes, report them to the Watch and this publication immediately. The Sharn Watch is bound by law to arrest these hooligans when they show their criminal natures.": "似乎沙恩观察站正在将越来越多的工作外包给承包商，也被称为冒险家，也被称为雇佣兵，这就是这些沾满鲜血的雇佣兵。虽然这些二流打手中的许多人表现得好像他们拥有沙恩守望的绝对权威，但要知道你的权利! 这些雇佣兵可以逃脱暴行，包括谋杀，但前提是这些罪行是在履行合同的过程中犯下的。如果这些流氓中的一个人无缘无故地偷窃或伤害你或你的亲人，除了他们的野蛮态度之外，请立即向观察站和本出版物报告他们。根据法律规定，当这些流氓表现出他们的犯罪本性时，沙恩观察组织有义务逮捕他们。",
	"Germaine is gruff and doesn't like wasting time. She gives the characters the information she has and tries to send them on their way before they can ask questions about her involvement in the case. The sooner the characters solve her problem, the sooner she can get back to collecting extra money from the Boromar Clan for doing nothing other than ignoring their crimes.": "杰曼性格粗暴，不喜欢浪费时间。她把她所掌握的信息告诉了这些人物，并试图在他们问及她参与此案的问题之前就把他们送上路。角色们越早解决她的问题，她就能越早从博罗玛家族那里收取额外的钱财，因为她除了无视他们的罪行之外什么都没做。",
	"Germaine gives the characters the following information:": "杰曼给了这些人物以下信息。",
	"Germaine has an appointment to meet with a warforged named Coal, who claims to have knowledge of a crime being committed in Old Sharn. Germaine wants the party to meet with Coal first and see if what she says adds up. Germaine is worried that, with her status as a Watch sergeant, her presence will call undue attention and endanger Coal.": "杰曼约了一个名叫 \"煤 \"的战争锻造者见面，他声称知道在旧沙恩发生的犯罪。杰曼想让大家先去见煤，看看她说的是否属实。杰曼担心，以她守夜人的身份，她的出现会引起不必要的注意并危及到煤。",
	"Germaine can give the characters 25 gp each now and another 50 gp each if they bring in Coal.": "杰曼现在可以给这些人物每人25戈比，如果他们带来煤炭，还可以给每人50戈比。",

	"Germaine also provides a Sharn Watch writ of enforcement. The writ authorizes the bearers to conduct official duties of the Watch under Sergeant Vilroy's authority. City workers and other members of the Watch respect the writ, sometimes grudgingly, as long as the characters don't engage in flagrantly illegal activity.": "杰曼还提供了一份沙恩守望的执行令状。该令状授权持有者在维尔罗伊警长的领导下执行守望的官方职责。只要人物不从事明目张胆的非法活动，城市工人和其他守望先锋成员就会尊重该令状，有时是勉强的。",
	"Germaine tries to play up her concern for Coal as her reason for hiring the characters, but a character who succeeds on a Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check contested by the Germaine's Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check can sense that she's holding something back. A character who talks to Germaine privately and succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check gets her to reveal that she sometimes takes money from the Boromar Clan to look into crimes, and the family is interested in Coal's information (though Germaine also points out that the characters really are Coal's best shot at surviving this ordeal, what with Coal being caught between the two largest criminal syndicates in the city).": "Germaine试图将她对Coal的关心作为她雇佣这些人物的理由，但是一个通过智慧（{@skill Insight}）检查成功的人物，在Germaine的魅力（{@skill Deception}）检查中可以感觉到她在隐瞒什么。一个与Germaine私下交谈并成功通过DC13魅力({@skill Persuasion})检查的角色可以让她透露，她有时会从Boromar家族那里拿钱来调查犯罪，而该家族对Coal的信息很感兴趣（不过Germaine也指出，这些角色确实是Coal在这场磨难中生存的最好机会，因为Coal被夹在城市中两个最大的犯罪集团之间）。",
	"If the characters have no place to stay in Sharn, Germaine puts them up at Ghallanda Hall in Middle Dura for the duration of their investigation.": "如果人物在沙恩没有地方住，杰曼就把他们安置在中杜拉的加兰达厅，供他们在调查期间居住。",
	"Sharn's neighborhood of High Walls in Lower Tavick's Landing is a district mostly enclosed by walls. All of the bridges from other districts to High Walls have massive, magically warded gates that can be sealed at a moment's notice. Each gate incorporates a fortified Sharn Watch station. The neighborhood is home to refugees of the Last War, mainly the displaced peoples of Cyre.": "沙恩所在的下塔维克城的高墙区是一个主要由墙围起来的地区。所有从其他地区通往高墙的桥梁都有巨大的、有魔法防护的大门，可以在任何时候被封锁。每个大门都有一个强化的沙恩守卫站。该区是最后一次战争的难民的家园，主要是赛尔的流离失所者。",
	"When the characters arrive in the district, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:": "当人物到达该区时，向玩家阅读或转述以下方框内的文字。",
	"The stench of body odor, garbage, and tobacco mix together in the streets. High walls cut this district's crumbling, vandalized buildings off from the rest of Sharn, though towers rise over the walls like imposing sentries. Many people stand idly on street corners, eying you suspiciously and keeping to themselves.": "尸臭、垃圾和烟草的臭味在街道上混合在一起。高高的围墙将这个地区破败的、被破坏的建筑与沙恩的其他地方隔绝开来，尽管塔楼像威严的哨兵一样耸立在墙上。许多人无所事事地站在街角，怀疑地盯着你，并保持沉默。",
	"It is a simple matter to find the Cog Carnival, and just about any resident can give directions. It's the only warforged bar in the neighborhood.": "找到 \"齿轮嘉年华 \"是一件很简单的事情，几乎所有的居民都能提供方向。它是附近唯一的战神酒吧。",

	"Smoky, low flames in a fireplace barely illuminate the cracked stone walls and filthy floor of this establishment. The single-room space is crowded with warforged with severed digits or limbs, scars, burns, and other wounds. Other warforged in the area are gathered around traditional dice, card, dart, and board games as well as carnival competitions such as throwing metal rings onto posts, tossing a ball at a tower of weighted iron cups hard enough to make them fall down, and striking a homemade machine hard enough with a hammer to make it ring a bell.": "壁炉里的烟熏火燎，勉强照亮了这个场所开裂的石墙和肮脏的地板。这个单间空间里挤满了断指或断肢、伤疤、烧伤和其他伤口的战友。这里的其他战友都聚集在传统的骰子、纸牌、飞镖和棋盘游戏周围，还有一些狂欢节比赛，比如把金属环扔到柱子上，把球扔到一个有重量的铁杯塔上，使其倒下，以及用锤子用力敲打一个自制的机器，使其响铃。",
	"A small bar in the corner serves cheap ale. Behind this bar, a warforged bartender shouts jeers at patrons losing games.": "角落里的一个小酒吧提供廉价啤酒。在这个酒吧的后面，一个战神级的酒保对输掉游戏的顾客大肆嘲笑。",
	"If the characters mention Sergeant Vilroy as they meet Coal, she stays calm but still asks why Vilroy didn't come herself. Vilroy's explanation to the party about attracting attention soothes Coal, as does the party explaining they are Vilroy's trusted confidants.": "如果人物在见到Coal时提到Vilroy警长，她会保持平静，但仍会问为什么Vilroy没有亲自来。维尔罗伊向当事人解释说会引起别人的注意，而当事人也解释说他们是维尔罗伊信任的知己，这让Coal感到很舒服。",
	"Once Coal is calmed, she hurriedly explains the kidnapping of a child from House Orien, the murder of her friend Razor, and Daask's hunt for artifacts in Old Sharn. Just as Coal is finishing her exposition, a bolt of fire explodes inches from Coal's head, causing bedlam in the Cog Carnival. Coal runs for her life, shouting that the party set her up. The chase is on!": "一旦煤被安抚下来，她就急忙解释奥瑞恩家族的一个孩子被绑架，她的朋友雷泽被谋杀，以及达斯克在旧沙恩寻找文物的事情。就在煤炭完成她的陈述时，一道火光在离煤炭头部几英寸的地方爆炸了，在齿轮嘉年华上引起了混乱。寇尔逃命去了，大叫着说是党组织陷害了她。追捕行动开始了!",
	"Coal sprints 60 feet away from the characters into High Wall's streets, intent on escape. The warforged has no particular destination in mind. She simply wants to get away from the characters, whom she believes set her up to be assassinated. This chase takes place in the \"theater of the mind,\" and there is no map for it.": "煤炭在离人物60英尺远的地方冲向高墙的街道，打算逃跑。这位战神并没有什么特别的目的地。她只是想逃离这些人物，她认为这些人陷害她，让她被暗杀。这场追逐发生在 \"心灵剧场 \"中，没有任何地图。",
	"If Coal runs away and the characters pursue her, use the {@book chase rules|DMG|8|Chases} and {@table urban chase complications||Urban Chase Complications table} in {@book chapter 8|DMG|7} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to resolve the scene. The chase ends when the characters catch up to Coal or after three rounds, when a Daask hit squad intercepts Coal as she runs through an alley.": "如果Coal逃跑了，角色们追赶她，就用{@book chase rules|DMG|8|Chases}和{@table urban chase complications||Urban Chase Complications table}在{@book chapter 8|DMG|7}的{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}来解决这个场景。当人物追上Coal时，或在三个回合后，当Daask的打击小组在Coal跑过小巷时拦截她时，追击就结束了。",

	"The criminals have no other useful information to share with the characters. They don't know Garra is a half-ogre, and they don't know how to contact her. A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence ({@skill History}) check knows Daask's members are mostly immigrants from Droaam and some of the local population from the Cogs and lower wards of Sharn.": "罪犯们没有其他有用的信息可以与人物分享。他们不知道Garra是个半妖，也不知道如何联系她。通过DC13智力({@skill History})检查成功的角色知道Daask的成员大多是来自Droaam的移民和一些来自沙恩的Cogs和下层病房的当地居民。",
	"After the Daask attack, Coal realizes she mistook the characters for assassins and apologizes. The warforged is soft-spoken and mild-mannered. If the characters ask her about Razor, she gets sad and offers the following information:": "在达斯克袭击事件发生后，煤球意识到她把这些人物误认为是刺客并表示道歉。这名战神说话很温柔，态度温和。如果角色们向她询问雷泽的情况，她会很伤心，并提供以下信息。",

	"Razor and Coal had trouble finding work in Sharn, due to the fact that many businesses are reluctant to hire warforged foreigners. The pair became desperate for money.": "剃刀和煤炭在沙恩很难找到工作，原因是许多企业不愿意雇用战地锻造的外国人。这对夫妇为了钱变得很绝望。",
	"A month ago, Razor told Coal she had a job working on a long-term secret mission for Alden d'Orien, the scion of a dragonmarked house. Warforged from other parts of the city were also recruited to help in the task. The job required physical labor, so Coal's injury prevented her from being able to do the job. Razor planned to save money then buy Coal a new arm so she could work with her.": "一个月前，Razor告诉Coal她有一份工作，为Alden d'Orien执行一项长期的秘密任务，他是一个有龙纹的家族的后裔。来自城市其他地方的战神也被招募来帮助完成这项任务。这项工作需要体力劳动，所以煤的伤势使她无法完成这项工作。Razor计划省钱，然后给Coal买一只新的手臂，这样她就可以和她一起工作了。",
	"Razor would often come back from work sullen or wounded but never opened up about the job until shortly before she died. Razor confessed that the job was more dangerous than it seemed when she was recruited. Razor was planning to quit before she died.": "雷泽尔经常会在工作结束后闷闷不乐或受伤，但直到她去世前不久，她从未公开过工作的情况。雷泽坦言，这份工作比她被招募时看起来更危险。在她死前，Razor打算辞职。",
	"After providing the characters with this information, Coal encourages the characters to question Alden d'Orien. The warforged then leaves Sharn, believing she is no longer safe in the city.": "在向人物提供了这些信息后，Coal鼓励人物去询问Alden d'Orien。然后这位战神离开了沙恩，认为她在这个城市不再安全。",
	"If Coal dies at the hands of Daask forces, the characters can still salvage the mission by bringing Coal's corpse to Sergeant Vilroy, who calls in a favor and gets a member of the Blackened Book to cast a {@spell speak with dead} spell on Coal's corpse.": "如果Coal死于Daask军队之手，人物仍然可以通过将Coal的尸体带给Vilroy中士来挽回任务，Vilroy中士叫人帮忙，让黑化书的成员对Coal的尸体施以{@spell speak with dead}法术。",
	"While many of the House Orien members live in the house's enclave in Terminus, the more powerful members of the dragonmarked family live in the upper wards of the city.

If the characters consult with Sergeant Vilroy, she suggests that they confront Alden d'Orien, but cautions them to be diplomatic.": "虽然很多奥瑞恩家族的成员都住在Terminus的飞地里，但这个龙纹家族更强大的成员则住在城市的上层区。如果人物四处打听，他们就会知道奥尔登-德-奥瑞恩在上中央高原的米特拉塔区有一个叫独角兽庄园的住所。如果人物向维尔罗伊警长咨询，她建议他们与阿尔登-德奥瑞恩对质，但告诫他们要有外交手段。",
