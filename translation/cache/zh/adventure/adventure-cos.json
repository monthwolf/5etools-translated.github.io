	"We turned the corner, and there was a vampire.": "我们转过街角，那里有一个吸血鬼。",
	"I groaned and rolled my eyes.": "我呻吟了一声，翻了翻眼睛。",
	"It was 1978, and I was playing in one of my first dungeon adventures. It was being run by a friend I had known in high school, John Scott Clegg, and it was typical of the type of adventure that people played in those days. It was all about exploring a hodgepodge collection of rooms connected by dungeon corridors, beating up the monsters that we encountered, searching for treasure, and gaining experience points.": "那是1978年，我正在玩我的第一个地下城冒险。它是由我在高中时认识的一个朋友约翰-斯科特-克莱格（John Scott Clegg）经营的，它是那个时代人们玩的典型的冒险类型。它是关于探索由地牢走廊连接的房间的大杂烩集合，击败我们遇到的怪物，寻找宝藏，并获得经验值。",
	"Now we were face to face with random encounter number thirty-four: a vampire. Not a Vampire with a capital V, but a so-many-Hit-Dice-with-such-and-such-an-Armor-Class lowercase vampire. Just another monster in the dungeon.": "现在我们面对的是第三十四号随机遭遇：一个吸血鬼。不是大写字母V的吸血鬼，而是一个小写字母 \"Hit-Dice with-such-and-such-an-Armor \"的吸血鬼。只是地牢里的另一个怪物。",
	"I remember thinking at the time, What are {@i you} doing here? This creature seemed completely out of place with the kobolds, orcs, and gelatinous cubes we had seen thus far. This was a creature who deserved his own setting and to be so much more than just a wandering monster. When I came home from that game, I told all these thoughts to Laura.": "我记得当时我在想，{@i you}在这里做什么？这种生物似乎与我们迄今为止看到的哥布林、兽人和胶质方块完全不相称。这是一个值得他自己设定的生物，而且不仅仅是一个游荡的怪物。当我从那个游戏中回家时，我把所有这些想法告诉了劳拉。",
	"Strahd would be no afterthought—he demanded his own setting, his own tragic history. Laura and I launched into researching the mythology and folklore surrounding the vampire. We started with the vague, black-and-white image of Bela Lugosi in 1931, but found so much more.": "斯特拉特不是事后才想到的，他要求有自己的背景，有自己的悲惨历史。劳拉和我开始研究围绕吸血鬼的神话和民间传说。我们从贝拉-卢戈西在1931年的模糊的黑白形象开始，但发现了很多东西。",
	"Byron—like the fictional vampires that he inspired, from Polidori's Lord Ruthven down through the penultimate work of Bram Stoker—was a decadent predator, an abuser hidden behind a romantic veil. He was a comely and alluring monster—but a monster nevertheless. The romantic vampire of the earliest years of the genre was not just a spouse abuser but a spouse killer, the archetype of abuse in the worst kind of destructive codependency.": "拜伦与他所激发的虚构的吸血鬼一样，从波利多里的鲁斯文勋爵到布拉姆-斯托克的倒数第二部作品，都是一个颓废的掠夺者，一个隐藏在浪漫面纱后面的虐待者。他是一个可爱的、诱人的怪物，但还是一个怪物。该类型小说早期的浪漫吸血鬼不仅是一个配偶虐待者，而且是一个配偶杀手，是最糟糕的破坏性依赖中的虐待的典型代表。",
	"For Laura and me, those were the elements that truly defined {@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS}—a selfish beast forever lurking behind a mask of tragic romance, the illusion of redemption that was ever only camouflage for his prey.": "对劳拉和我来说，这些是真正定义{@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS}的元素--一个自私的野兽永远潜伏在悲剧性浪漫的面具后面，救赎的假象永远只是他猎物的伪装。",
	"Initially we were going to title the adventure {@i Vampyr}—one of a series of games we called Nightventure that Laura and I were self-publishing back in 1978. The castle was called Ravenloft, and when Halloween came around each year, our friends asked us if we could play \"that Ravenloft game\" again... and so the better title won out. It was, in part, because of this design that I was hired by TSR, Inc., to write {@b Dungeons & Dragons} adventures in 1982. Soon thereafter, I6 {@i Ravenloft} was published.": "最初，我们打算把这个冒险的标题定为{@i Vampyr}--我们称之为Nightventure的系列游戏之一，劳拉和我早在1978年就开始自行出版了。那座城堡叫Ravenloft，每年万圣节到来时，我们的朋友都会问我们能不能再玩一次 \"那个Ravenloft游戏\"......于是这个更好的标题就赢了。部分是由于这个设计，我在1982年被TSR公司雇用来写{@b Dungeons & Dragons}冒险。此后不久，I6{@i Ravenloft}就出版了。",
	"Since then, fans of {@i Ravenloft} have seen many different creative perspectives on Barovia (a country which, by absolute coincidence, is featured in a 1947 Bob Hope movie called {@i Where There's Life}). It continues to be one of the most popular {@b Dungeons & Dragons} adventures of all time. In its various incarnations, each designer has endeavored to bring something new to the ancient legend of Strahd, and to each of them we are grateful.": "从那时起，{@i Ravenloft}的粉丝们看到了许多关于巴罗维亚的不同创意观点（绝对巧合的是，这个国家在1947年鲍勃-霍普的一部名为{@i Where There's Life}的电影中出现）。它仍然是有史以来最受欢迎的{@b Dungeons & Dragons}冒险故事之一。在其不同的化身中，每个设计师都努力为古老的斯特拉赫特传说带来新的东西，我们对他们每个人都心存感激。",
	"But the vampire genre has taken a turn from its roots in recent years. The vampire we so often see today exemplifies the polar opposite of the original archetype: the lie that it's okay to enter into a romance with an abusive monster because if you love it enough, it will change.": "但近年来，吸血鬼流派已经从其根源上发生了转变。我们今天经常看到的吸血鬼体现了与原始原型截然相反的特点：谎言是，与一个虐待人的怪物谈恋爱是可以的，因为如果你足够爱它，它就会改变。",
	"When Laura and I got a call from Christopher Perkins about revisiting {@i Ravenloft}, we hoped we could bring the message of the vampire folktale back to its original cautionary roots. The talented team at Wizards of the Coast not only graciously took our suggestions but engaged us in a dialogue that delivered new insights on the nightmare beyond the gates of Barovia.": "当劳拉和我接到克里斯托弗-帕金斯关于重温{@i Ravenloft}的电话时，我们希望我们能把这个吸血鬼的民间故事的信息带回它最初的警戒性根源。海岸奇才的天才团队不仅慷慨地接受了我们的建议，还与我们进行了对话，对巴罗维亚城门外的噩梦提出了新的见解。",
	"Now we invite you again as our guests to pass through the Svalich Woods if you dare. For here the romance is tragically dangerous... and a true monster smiles at your approach.": "现在我们再次邀请你作为我们的客人，如果你敢于通过斯瓦里奇森林。因为这里的浪漫是悲惨的危险......一个真正的怪物对你的接近微笑着。",
	"Lightning splits the clouds overhead, casting stark white light across him. Strahd turns to the sky, revealing the angular muscles of his face and hands. He has a look of power—and of madness. His once handsome face is contorted by a tragedy darker than the night itself.": "闪电劈开了头顶的云层，在他身上投下刺眼的白光。斯特拉特转向天空，露出他脸上和手上的棱角分明的肌肉。他有一种力量和疯狂的表情。他曾经英俊的脸庞被一种比黑夜更黑暗的悲剧所扭曲。",
	"Rumbling thunder pounds the castle spires. The wind's howling increases as Strahd turns his gaze back to the village. Far below, yet not beyond his ken, a party of adventurers has just entered his domain. Strahd's face forms a twisted smile as his dark plan unfolds. He knew they were coming, and he knows why they have come—all according to his plan. He, the master of Ravenloft, will attend to them.": "隆隆的雷声敲打着城堡的尖顶。当斯特拉赫特将目光转向村庄时，风的呼啸声越来越大。在遥远的下方，但并不超出他的能力范围，一队冒险者刚刚进入他的领域。随着他的黑暗计划的展开，斯特拉赫特的脸上形成了一个扭曲的微笑。他知道他们会来，也知道他们为什么会来--一切都按照他的计划进行。他，拉文洛夫特的主人，将为他们服务。",
	"Another lightning flash rips through the darkness, its thunder echoing through the castle's towers. But Strahd is gone. Only the howling of the wind—or perhaps a lone wolf—fills the midnight air. The master of Ravenloft is having guests for dinner. And you are invited.": "另一道闪电撕裂了黑暗，它的雷声在城堡的塔楼上回荡。但斯特拉赫特不见了。午夜的空气中只有风的呼啸声，或者说是一匹孤狼。拉文洛夫特的主人要请客人吃饭。你被邀请了。",
	"{@i Curse of Strahd} is a story of gothic horror, presented here as {@b Dungeons & Dragons} roleplaying game adventure for a party of four to six adventurers of levels 1–10. A balance of character classes is helpful, since the adventurers will face a variety of challenges. Each character class will certainly have its moment to shine.": "{@i Curse of Strahd}是一个哥特式恐怖故事，在此以{@b Dungeons & Dragons}角色扮演游戏冒险的方式呈现，适合四至六名1-10级的冒险者。角色等级的平衡是有帮助的，因为冒险者将面临各种挑战。每个角色等级肯定会有其闪光的时刻。",
	"This adventure is a retelling of the original {@i Ravenloft} adventure, which was published in 1983 by TSR, Inc. In the years since, the original has gained a reputation as one of the greatest {@b Dungeons & Dragons} adventures ever, and it went on to inspire the creation of a campaign setting of the same name in 1990: Ravenloft, home of the Domains of Dread.": "这个冒险是对原版{@i Ravenloft}冒险的重述，原版于1983年由TSR公司出版。在此后的岁月里，原作获得了有史以来最伟大的{@b Dungeons & Dragons}冒险之一的声誉，并在1990年激发了同名活动设定的创建。拉文洛夫特（Ravenloft），恐惧之域的所在地。",
	"Module I6: {@i Ravenloft}, written by Tracy and Laura Hickman, broke new ground by presenting a D&D adventure that was as much story-driven as location-based, featuring a villain who was complex and terrifying. Castle Ravenloft, with its amazing three-dimensional maps, remains to this day one of the most iconic and memorable of all D&D dungeons.": "由特雷西和劳拉-希克曼编写的模块I6：{@i Ravenloft}开创了新的局面，呈现了一个既以故事为导向又以地点为基础的D&D冒险，其特色是一个复杂而可怕的反派。拉文洛夫特城堡（Castle Ravenloft）拥有惊人的三维地图，至今仍是所有D&D地牢中最具标志性和令人难忘的地方。",
	"This book includes the original adventure, as well as expanded material developed in consultation with Tracy and Laura Hickman. It expands what we know about the lands around Castle Ravenloft and sheds new light on the dark past of the castle's lord. The lands of Barovia are from a forgotten world in the D&D multiverse, and this adventure gives glimpses into that world. In time, cursed Barovia was torn from its home world by the Dark Powers and bound in mist as one of the Domains of Dread in the Shadowfell.": "本书包括原版冒险，以及与特雷西和劳拉-希克曼协商开发的扩展材料。它扩展了我们对雷文洛夫特城堡周围土地的了解，并为城堡主人的黑暗过去提供了新的线索。巴罗维亚的土地来自D&D多元宇宙中一个被遗忘的世界，这次冒险让人们瞥见了那个世界。随着时间的推移，被诅咒的巴罗维亚被黑暗势力从它的母体世界中剥离出来，并被束缚在迷雾中，成为阴影城中的恐惧之域之一。",

	"Barovia is a land of ghosts, werewolves, and other fell creatures. The wilderness hides many secrets, including forgotten ruins and battlefields that tell the story of Strahd's life as a conqueror. Adventurers who explore the wilderness find the remnants of Strahd's ancient enemies, not all of them as dead as one might expect.": "巴罗维亚是一个充满鬼魂、狼人和其他堕落生物的地方。荒野中隐藏着许多秘密，包括被遗忘的遗迹和战场，讲述着斯特拉赫特作为征服者的故事。探索荒野的冒险家们发现了斯特拉赫特古代敌人的残余，但他们并不像人们想象的那样全部死亡。",
	"For the people of Barovia, there is no escape from this harsh land. The town of Vallaki stands ready to defend itself against the servants of Strahd, but it's far from the sanctuary it purports to be. The village of Krezk lies near the edge of Strahd's domain, its abbey now in the clutches of evil, misguided creatures.": "对于巴罗维亚的人民来说，他们无法逃离这片严酷的土地。瓦拉基镇随时准备抵御斯特拉赫特的仆人，但它远不是它所宣称的圣地。克雷兹克村位于斯特拉赫特领地的边缘，其修道院现在被邪恶的、被误导的生物所控制。",
	"The village of Barovia cowers in the shadow of Castle Ravenloft, Strahd's home and fortress. The castle stands atop a great spire of rock, invincible and ever watchful. Every night, thousands of bats fly out of the castle to feed. It is said that Strahd sometimes flies with them. Barovia will never be safe until the evil in his castle is destroyed.": "巴罗维亚村在拉文洛夫特城堡的阴影下瑟瑟发抖，这是斯特拉赫特的家和堡垒。城堡矗立在一个巨大的岩石尖顶上，所向披靡，时刻警惕着。每天晚上，数以千计的蝙蝠从城堡里飞出来觅食。据说，斯特拉赫特有时会和它们一起飞翔。巴罗维亚永远不会安全，除非他城堡里的邪恶被摧毁。",
	"Once Strahd becomes aware of the adventurers, he and his spies watch them closely. When the time is right, Strahd invites his \"guests\" to Castle Ravenloft. He aims to turn them against one another, torment them, and kill them, as he has done with so many other visitors. Some will become undead thralls. Others will never rise again.": "一旦斯特拉赫特知道了这些冒险家，他和他的间谍就会密切关注他们。当时机成熟时，斯特拉赫特会邀请他的 \"客人 \"到雷文洛夫特城堡。他的目的是让他们彼此对立，折磨他们，并杀死他们，就像他对其他许多访客所做的那样。有些人将成为不死的傀儡。另一些人将永远不会复活。",
	"The adventurers' best hope of defeating Strahd is to learn his secrets, for he is no ordinary vampire. Guided by {@creature Madam Eva|CoS}'s card reading, they must scour his domain and his castle for magic items that might weaken or slay him, all the while trying to stay alive.": "冒险家们打败斯特拉赫特的最大希望是了解他的秘密，因为他不是普通的吸血鬼。在{@creature Madam Eva|CoS}的读卡指导下，他们必须在他的领地和城堡中寻找可能削弱或杀死他的魔法物品，同时努力保住性命。",
	"Although the adventurers can escape by slaying Strahd, he can't be truly destroyed. Barovia is his prison, and not even death can free him from his curse.": "虽然冒险家们可以通过杀死斯特拉赫特逃脱，但他不可能被真正摧毁。巴罗维亚是他的监狱，即使死亡也不能使他摆脱诅咒。",
	"The adventure ends when either {@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS} or the characters are defeated. Your goal is to keep Strahd in play for as long as possible, using all the abilities and resources at his disposal.": "当{@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS}或角色被击败时，冒险就会结束。你的目标是尽可能延长斯特拉赫特的游戏时间，利用他掌握的所有能力和资源。",
	"Much of the adventure's action is driven by the clash between the adventurers' decisions and Strahd's goals, and the adventurers and the vampire are all caught in strands of fate that are represented by a special card reading detailed in {@area chapter 1|021|x}, \"Into the Mists.\" Before you run the adventure, you need to conduct that reading to determine the location of several items that are key to the story, as well as one of the locations where Strahd can be found.": "冒险的大部分行动是由冒险者的决定和斯特拉赫特的目标之间的冲突推动的，冒险者和吸血鬼都陷入了命运的漩涡中，这些命运漩涡在{@area chapter 1|021|x}，\"进入迷雾 \"中详细说明的特殊读卡中得到了体现。在进行冒险之前，你需要进行该读牌，以确定对故事至关重要的几件物品的位置，以及可以找到斯特拉赫特的一个地点。",
	"{@adventure Chapter 1|CoS|2} also outlines Strahd's goals, and it suggests adventure hooks to draw the player characters into the cursed realm of Barovia.

	"The {@adventure epilogue|CoS|17} offers ways for you to end the adventure. {@adventure Appendix C|CoS|20} details the special items—magical or otherwise—introduced in the adventure, and {@adventure appendix D|CoS|21} provides stat blocks for Strahd and various NPCs and monsters that can be met in Barovia. {@adventure Appendix E|CoS|22} shows the tarokka cards that the Vistani use for their fortune telling, and {@adventure appendix F|CoS|23} contains handouts for you to show the players.": "{@adventure epilogue|CoS|17}为你提供了结束冒险的方法。{@adventure Appendix C|CoS|20}详细介绍了冒险中引入的特殊物品--魔法或其他物品，{@adventure appendix D|CoS|21}提供了斯特拉赫以及在巴罗维亚可以遇到的各种NPC和怪物的状态块。{@adventure Appendix E|CoS|22}展示了维斯坦人用来算命的塔罗卡牌，{@adventure appendix F|CoS|23}包含了供你向玩家展示的讲义。",
	"The adventure is meant for characters of levels 1–10 and includes threats for those levels and beyond. Strahd can be an especially deadly challenge at these levels.

Characters who head directly to Castle Ravenloft without first increasing their power will likely die.": "这场冒险是为1-10级的角色准备的，包括这些级别及以上的威胁。在这些级别中，斯特拉赫特可能是一个特别致命的挑战。假设角色在冒险过程中会提高等级，并获得盟友和强大的魔法物品，使天平向他们倾斜。角色如果不先提高自己的实力就直接前往雷文洛夫特城堡，很可能会死亡。",
	"You can award experience points for the defeat of foes, use milestone awards, or a mixture of both.

	"Be prepared for the fact that the adventure is exceedingly open-ended—one of the hallmarks of the original {@i Ravenloft}.

A mirror hanging on a wall might have the power to transfix all who gaze into it, or it might be nothing out of the ordinary. In a horror story, taking the time to describe an object in detail draws attention to it, makes one suspicious of it, and might distract from the real danger. Here are a couple of tricks you can use:": "在一个恐怖故事中，不知道哪里可能潜伏着危险。一个淫荡的石像鬼可能是一个伪装的怪物，或者只是一个邪恶的雕塑。挂在墙上的一面镜子可能有能力迷惑所有注视它的人，或者它可能没有什么特别之处。在一个恐怖故事中，花时间详细描述一个物体会引起人们的注意，使人们对它产生怀疑，并可能分散对真正危险的注意力。这里有几个你可以使用的技巧。",

	"Allow NPCs (even evil ones) to tell jokes, speak in a funny voice, or behave idiotically. Even morbid humor is better than none.": "允许NPC（甚至是邪恶的NPC）讲笑话，用有趣的声音说话，或者表现得很白痴。即使是病态的幽默也比没有好。",
	"When a hero, villain, or monster rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, describe a humorous mishap that occurs as a result of the low roll, such as a character accidentally knocking over a lamp and setting some drapes on fire while trying to hide or move silently.": "当英雄、恶棍或怪物在攻击卷、能力检查或蓄力投掷中掷出自然数为1时，描述因掷出低分而发生的幽默事故，如人物在试图躲藏或悄悄移动时，不小心打翻了台灯，点燃了一些窗帘。",

	"In life, {@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS} was a count, a prince, a soldier, and a conqueror. After the death of his father, King Barov, Strahd waged long, bloody wars against his family's enemies. He and his army cornered the last of these enemies in a remote mountain valley before slaying them all. Strahd named the valley Barovia, after his deceased father, and was so struck by its scenic beauty that he decided to settle there.": "在生活中，{@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS}是一个伯爵，一个王子，一个士兵和一个征服者。在他的父亲巴罗夫国王死后，斯特拉赫特对他家族的敌人发动了漫长而血腥的战争。他和他的军队将这些敌人中的最后一个逼到了一个偏远的山谷里，然后将他们全部杀死。斯特拉特以其已故父亲的名字命名该山谷为巴罗维亚，并被其美丽的风景所震撼，决定在此定居。",
	"Queen Ravenovia lamented the death of Barov and was fearful of Strahd. War had made him cold and arrogant. She kept her younger son, Sergei, away from the battlefield. Strahd envied the love and attention his mother visited upon his brother, so in Barovia he remained. Peace made Strahd restless, and he began to feel like his best years were behind him. Unwilling to go the way of his father, Strahd studied magic and forged a pact with the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell in return for the promise of immortality.": "拉文维亚女王对巴罗夫的死感到惋惜，对斯特拉赫特感到恐惧。战争使他变得冷酷和傲慢。她让她的小儿子谢尔盖远离战场。斯特拉特羡慕母亲对弟弟的爱和关注，所以他留在巴罗维亚。和平让斯特拉赫特感到不安，他开始觉得自己最好的时光已经过去了。由于不愿意走父亲的老路，斯特拉赫特学习了魔法，并与暗影城的黑暗势力签订了契约，以换取不朽的承诺。",
	"Strahd scoured his conquered lands for wizards and artisans, brought them to the valley of Barovia, and commanded them to raise a castle to rival the magnificent fortresses of his ancestral homeland. Strahd named the castle Ravenloft, after his mother, to demonstrate his love for her. When it was complete, Strahd commanded his mother and brother to come to Barovia and stay with him. Sergei eventually took up residence at Ravenloft, but Ravenovia passed away while traveling to her namesake. In sorrowful disappointment, Strahd sealed his mother's body in a crypt beneath the castle.": "斯特拉特在他征服的土地上寻找巫师和工匠，把他们带到巴罗维亚谷地，并命令他们建造一座城堡，与他祖国的宏伟堡垒相媲美。斯特拉特以他母亲的名字命名这座城堡，以示对她的爱。城堡建成后，斯特拉赫特命令他的母亲和弟弟来到巴罗维亚，和他一起住。谢尔盖最终在拉文洛夫特住了下来，但拉文洛夫特在前往她的名字的途中去世了。在悲痛的失望中，斯特拉赫特将母亲的尸体封存在城堡下面的墓穴中。",
	"Strahd's attention soon turned to Tatyana, a young Barovian woman of fine lineage and remarkable beauty. Strahd believed her to be a worthy bride, and he lavished Tatyana with gifts and attention. Despite Strahd's efforts, she instead fell in love with the younger, warmer Sergei. Strahd's pride prevented him from standing in the way of the young couple's love until the day of Sergei and Tatyana's wedding, when Strahd gazed into a mirror and realized he had been a fool. Strahd murdered Sergei and drank his blood, sealing the evil pact between Strahd and the Dark Powers. He then chased Sergei's bride-to-be through the gardens, determined to make her accept and love him. Tatyana hurled herself off a castle balcony to escape Strahd's pursuit, plunging to her death. Treacherous castle guards, seizing the opportunity to rid the world of Strahd forever, shot their master with arrows.": "斯特拉特的注意力很快转移到塔季扬身上，她是一位年轻的巴罗维亚女子，拥有优良的血统和非凡的美丽。斯特拉特认为她是一个值得信赖的新娘，他给塔季扬娜送去了礼物和关注。尽管斯特拉赫特费尽心机，她还是爱上了更年轻、更热情的谢尔盖。斯特拉特的自尊心使他无法阻挡这对年轻夫妇的爱情，直到谢尔盖和塔季扬娜的婚礼那天，斯特拉特凝视着镜子，意识到自己是个傻瓜。斯特拉特杀害了谢尔盖，喝下了他的血，封印了斯特拉特和黑暗势力之间的邪恶契约。然后他在花园里追赶谢尔盖的准新娘，决心让她接受并爱上他。塔季扬娜为躲避斯特拉赫特的追捕，从城堡阳台上跳下，摔死了。狡猾的城堡守卫抓住机会，永远摆脱了斯特拉赫特，用箭射杀了他们的主人。",
	"But Strahd did not die. The Dark Powers honored the pact they had made. The sky went black as Strahd turned on the guards, his eyes blazing red. He had become a vampire.": "但斯特拉赫特并没有死。黑暗势力履行了他们的约定。天空一片漆黑，斯特拉赫特转身向卫兵走去，他的眼睛闪着红光。他已经变成了一个吸血鬼。",
	"After slaughtering the guards, Strahd saw the faces of his father and mother in the thunderclouds, looking down upon him and judging him. He had destroyed the family bloodline and doomed all of Barovia. The castle and the valley were spirited away, locked in a demiplane surrounded on all sides by deadly fog. For Strahd and his people, there would be no escape.": "屠杀守卫后，斯特拉赫特在雷云中看到了父亲和母亲的脸，他们俯视着他，对他进行审判。他破坏了家族的血统，注定了整个巴罗维亚的命运。城堡和山谷被带走了，被锁在一个半位面，四面都被致命的雾气包围。对于斯特拉赫特和他的子民来说，他们将无法逃脱。",
	"Strahd has been the master of Ravenloft for centuries now. Since becoming a vampire, he has taken several consorts—none as beloved as Tatyana, but each a person of beauty. All of them he turned into vampire spawn. Although he feeds on the hapless souls of Barovia, they provide little nourishment and no comfort. From time to time, strangers from faraway lands are brought to his domain, to play the vampire's game of cat-and-mouse. Strahd savors these moments, for though these strangers offer him no lands to conquer, they aren't so easily destroyed and therefore provide a welcome diversion.": "斯特拉赫成为雷文洛夫特的主人已经有几个世纪了。自从成为吸血鬼后，他娶了几个妃子--没有一个像塔蒂亚娜那样受人爱戴，但每个人都很美丽。所有这些人都被他变成了吸血鬼的后代。虽然他以巴罗维亚的不幸灵魂为食，但他们没有提供什么营养，也没有安慰。不时有来自远方的陌生人被带到他的领地，与吸血鬼玩猫捉老鼠的游戏。斯特拉特喜欢这些时刻，因为虽然这些陌生人没有给他提供可以征服的土地，但他们不容易被摧毁，因此提供了一个受欢迎的转移。",
	"Strahd believes that the key to his escaping Barovia lies in finding someone worthy to rule in his stead, but his arrogance are so indomitable that no one is ever good enough in his eyes. He believes in his cold heart that only a von Zarovich as great as he or his father could sway the Dark Powers to release him.": "斯特拉特认为，他逃出巴罗维亚的关键在于找到一个值得代替他统治的人，但他的傲慢是如此不屈不挠，在他眼里，没有人是足够好的。他冷酷地认为，只有像他或他父亲那样伟大的冯-扎罗维奇才能动摇黑暗势力，释放他。",

	"Strahd's unrequited love for Tatyana drove him to slay his brother, Sergei. Some time ago, Strahd glimpsed the young woman {@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS} in the village of Barovia and felt extreme déjà vu. Ireena looked exactly like Tatyana! Strahd now believes that Ireena is the latest reincarnation of Tatyana, and thus he seeks to claim her.": "斯特拉特对塔季扬娜的单相思驱使他杀死了他的兄弟谢尔盖。前段时间，斯特拉赫特在巴罗维亚村瞥见了这位年轻女子{@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS}，感到极度似曾相识。伊莲娜与塔季扬娜长得一模一样! 斯特拉特现在认为，伊莲娜是塔季扬娜的最新转世，因此他试图认领她。",
	"Strahd's evil courtship has led him to visit Ireena twice. On both occasions, he charmed his way into her home—the house of her adopted father, the burgomaster of the village of Barovia—and drank her blood. He intends to kill Ireena during their next meeting and turn her into his vampire spawn consort.": "斯特拉特的邪恶求爱使他两次访问伊莲娜。这两次，他都用魅力进入了她的家--她的养父，巴罗维亚村的村长的家，并喝了她的血。他打算在他们的下一次会面中杀了伊丽娜，把她变成他的吸血鬼卵子妃子。",

	"Although he is usually focused on making {@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS} his bride, Strahd has been distracted by reports that a legendary vampire hunter named Rudolph van Richten has come to Barovia. It takes more than one old man with a death wish to frighten Strahd; nevertheless, the vampire has his spies searching Barovia for van Richten. Strahd would like very much to meet the old vampire hunter, lock him in the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft, and slowly break his spirit.": "虽然他通常专注于制造{@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS}他的新娘，但斯特拉赫特却被一个名叫鲁道夫-范-里希特的传奇吸血鬼猎人来到巴罗维亚的报告所干扰。要想吓唬住斯特拉赫特，可不仅仅是一个有死亡愿望的老人；尽管如此，这位吸血鬼还是让他的间谍在巴罗维亚寻找范里希特。斯特拉特非常想见到这位老吸血鬼猎人，把他关在雷文洛夫特城堡的地牢里，并慢慢打垮他的精神。",

	"Strahd can sense the arrival of new blood in his domain. When newcomers enter Barovia, he shifts his attention from {@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS} and van Richten to his new guests so that he can determine whether any of them is worthy to be his successor or consort. (Eventually, he decides that none of them can replace him as master of Barovia, but he doesn't arrive at this conclusion immediately.)": "斯特拉特能感觉到他的领地里有新血的到来。当新人进入巴罗维亚时，他将注意力从{@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS}和范里顿转移到新客人身上，以便确定他们中是否有人值得成为他的继承人或妃子。(最终，他决定他们中没有人能够取代他成为巴罗维亚的主人，但他并没有立即得出这个结论）。",
	"Strahd pays close attention to adventurers who are charismatic and arrogant, like himself. He focuses his attacks on them, to see how much they can withstand. If they crumble easily, he loses interest in them. If they exhibit great fortitude and defiance, his interest is piqued—even more so if the character displays uncommon knowledge or beauty. Such a person might not be worthy to succeed him, but the man or woman might provide amusement to Strahd as a new possession.": "斯特拉特密切关注那些像他一样有魅力和傲慢的冒险家。他集中攻击他们，看他们能承受多大的伤害。如果他们容易崩溃，他就对他们失去兴趣。如果他们表现出巨大的毅力和反抗精神，他的兴趣就会被激发出来--如果这个人物表现出不寻常的知识或美貌，他就更有兴趣了。这样的人可能不配继承他的事业，但这个人可能为斯特拉赫特提供娱乐，成为他的新财产。",
	"Strahd believes his soul is lost to evil. He feels neither pity nor remorse, neither love nor hate. He doesn't suffer anguish or wallow in indignation. He believes, and has always believed, that he is the master of his own fate.": "斯特拉特认为自己的灵魂已被邪恶所侵蚀。他既不怜悯也不悔恨，既不爱也不恨。他没有痛苦，也不沉湎于愤慨。他相信，而且一直相信，他是自己命运的主人。",
	"When he was alive, Strahd could admit to letting his emotions get the better of him from time to time. Now, as a vampire, he is more monster than man, with barely a hint of emotion left. He is above the concerns of the living. The only event that occasionally haunts him is the death of Tatyana, but his view of the past is bereft of romance or regret. In his mind, her death couldn't have been prevented, and what is done cannot be undone.": "活着的时候，斯特拉赫特可以承认，他时常会让自己的情绪变得更好。现在，作为一个吸血鬼，他与其说是人，不如说是怪物，几乎没有一丝情感。他超越了活人的关注。唯一偶尔困扰他的事件是塔季扬娜的死，但他对过去的看法是没有浪漫或遗憾。在他看来，她的死是无法避免的，而已经发生的事情是无法挽回的。",
	"In life, Strahd lived to conquer. In undeath, he conquers still—not realms, but people, driving good souls to become corrupt and destroying those who won't yield. Characters who try to appeal to Strahd's humanity will be gravely disappointed, because there is little humanity left in him. If they ask Strahd why he's preying on {@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS}, he tells them that Ireena's body is the host for Tatyana's soul, and Tatyana's soul belongs to him.": "生前，斯特拉赫特以征服为生。在死后，他仍在征服--不是王国，而是人，驱使善良的灵魂变得堕落，摧毁那些不愿屈服的人。试图迎合斯特拉赫特的人性的角色会大失所望，因为他身上已经没有什么人性了。如果他们问斯特拉赫特为什么要捕食{@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS}，他会告诉他们，伊莲娜的身体是塔蒂亚娜灵魂的宿主，而塔蒂亚娜的灵魂属于他。",
	"Strahd can be seductive and subtle when he chooses to be, especially if a person is clever or attractive. Men and women of beauty and cunning amuse Strahd for a time—playthings to possess or discard as he desires.": "如果斯特拉赫特愿意，他可以很有诱惑力，特别是当一个人很聪明或很有吸引力时。美貌和狡猾的男人和女人会让斯特拉赫特暂时感到高兴，他可以按照自己的意愿占有或抛弃这些东西。",
	"If he senses a lack of cohesion in a party of adventurers, he preys on that weakness and tries to drive a wedge between the characters by promising to help one at the expense of another. If Strahd senses evil in a person, he cultivates that tendency by offering to turn that character into a full-fledged vampire after helping Strahd destroy the rest of the party. Ultimately, Strahd doesn't honor his promise, instead turning the character into a vampire spawn under his control.": "如果他感觉到冒险者队伍缺乏凝聚力，他就会利用这一弱点，通过承诺帮助一个人而牺牲另一个人，试图在角色之间制造隔阂。如果斯特拉赫特察觉到一个人的邪恶，他就会培养这种倾向，在帮助斯特拉赫特消灭队伍的其他成员后，将该角色变成一个成熟的吸血鬼。最终，斯特拉赫特没有兑现他的承诺，而是将该人物变成了受他控制的吸血鬼卵。",
	"When Strahd wants to terrorize the characters, he pays them a visit, either under the cloak of night or beneath overcast skies during the day.

Strahd and his minions never attack Ireena.": "当斯特拉赫特想恐吓角色时，他就会拜访他们，要么在夜幕下，要么在白天的阴霾天空下。如果他们在室内，他就会试图迷惑或诱导一个角色邀请他进去（如果他的吸血鬼后代在场，也会邀请他们）。斯特拉特和他的爪牙从不攻击伊莲娜。",
	"These encounters are meant to test the characters, not kill them. After a few rounds of toying with them, Strahd and his creatures withdraw. If the characters retreat, Strahd is likely to allow them to flee, savoring their fear and believing he has broken them.": "这些遭遇是为了测试角色，而不是杀死他们。在玩弄他们几轮后，斯特拉赫特和他的生物会撤退。如果角色撤退，斯特拉赫特可能会让他们逃走，品尝他们的恐惧，并认为他已经打破了他们。",

	"Eravien believes that he can gain prestige within the Lords' Alliance if he learns the whereabouts of the \"ancient portal\" that the werewolves are using and destroys it. He is convinced that the portal represents a danger not only to Daggerford but also to Waterdeep. Any Lords' Alliance character who agrees to destroy it is given a {@item spell scroll} of {@spell magic weapon}. Eravien also promises to furnish the character with a letter of recommendation (see \"{@book Marks of Prestige|DMG|7|Marks of Prestige}\" in chapter 7 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}) once the portal is destroyed.": "埃拉温认为，如果他知道了狼人正在使用的 \"古代传送门 \"的下落并将其摧毁，他就能在领主联盟中获得声望。他确信这个传送门不仅对达格福德，而且对水底世界都是一种危险。任何同意摧毁它的领主联盟角色都会得到{@item spell scroll}的奖励。Eravien还承诺，一旦传送门被摧毁，将为该角色提供一封推荐信（见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}第七章的\"{@book Marks of Prestige|DMG|7|Marks of Prestige}\"）。",

Agents of the alliance are chosen primarily for their loyalty, and are trained in observation, stealth, innuendo, and combat. Backed by the wealthy, they carry well-made equipment (often disguised to appear common). Alliance operatives are often glory hounds.": "尽管联盟成员已承诺联合起来应对共同的威胁，但其中的每一位领主都将自己的命运和财富置于所有其他定居点之上。联盟的代理人主要因其忠诚度而被选中，并接受观察、隐蔽、暗示和战斗方面的训练。在富人的支持下，他们携带制作精良的装备（经常被伪装成普通人）。联盟的特工往往是荣誉的猎手。",

	"The idyllic valley nestled in the Balinok Mountains was a slice of heaven to those who knew of its existence before Strahd's arrival. The serenity of the place was forever shattered when Strahd led a bloody crusade against the enemies of his family that ended here with the slaughter of hundreds.

	"The land now called Barovia is no longer part of the world that Strahd once tried to conquer. It now exists within a demiplane formed by Strahd's consciousness and surrounded by a deadly fog.

	"Strahd allows the Vistani to come and go as they please because he admires their lust for life and their willingness to serve him when he needs them. He also owes an ancient debt to the Vistani people. As a soldier centuries ago, he suffered a grievous injury in battle, and the Vistani tended his wounds and returned him safely to his family without making any demand for payment. The Vistani claim to possess potions that allow them to leave Strahd's domain, but the potions are false concoctions with no magical power. Nevertheless, the Vistani are willing to sell them for a hefty price.": "斯特拉特允许维斯坦人来去自如，因为他欣赏他们对生命的渴望，以及他们在他需要时愿意为他服务。他还欠着维斯坦人一笔古老的债务。几个世纪前，作为一名士兵，他在战斗中受了重伤，维斯坦人为他疗伤，并将他安全送回了家，没有提出任何报酬要求。维斯坦人声称拥有能让他们离开斯特拉赫特领地的药水，但这些药水是虚假的混合物，没有神奇的力量。尽管如此，维斯坦人还是愿意以高价出售。",
	"Native Barovians have been terrorized for centuries by the one they call \"the devil Strahd.\" Only a handful of them have the will to oppose him. Barovians congregate in the valley's three main settlements—the villages of Barovia and Krezk and the town of Vallaki—for fear of falling prey to wolves and other beasts that prowl the woods. Among these people are the Keepers of the Feather, a secret society of wereravens. Not powerful enough to defeat Strahd on their own, the Keepers readily assist adventurers who find themselves drawn into Strahd's domain.": "巴罗维亚本地人被他们称为 \"魔鬼斯特拉赫特 \"的人恐吓了几个世纪。他们中只有少数人有意愿反对他。巴罗维亚人聚集在山谷中的三个主要定居点--巴罗维亚和克雷兹克村以及瓦拉基镇，因为他们害怕成为狼和其他在森林中游荡的野兽的猎物。在这些人中，有一个由狼人组成的秘密社团 \"羽毛守护者\"。守护者的力量不足以单独击败斯特拉赫，他们很乐意帮助那些被卷入斯特拉赫领域的冒险者。",

	"The evergreen trees of the Svalich Woods climb the sides of the mountains that enclose the valley. The largest of these peaks is Mount Baratok, with its snow-covered cap and rugged slopes. Baratok's slightly smaller twin, Mount Ghakis, is mostly bald with tufts of trees here and there. Between these two mountains stands Lake Zarovich, which is fed by streams of ice-cold water pouring down the face of Mount Baratok. On the south side of the lake rests the town of Vallaki, enclosed by a palisade. West of the two mountains, atop a hill, stands the Abbey of Saint Markovia, around which the Barovians built a walled village named Krezk. Between Vallaki and Krezk lie the ruins of Argynvostholt, the fallen bastion of a knightly order called the Order of the Silver Dragon, wiped out by Strahd and his army. East of the mountains lies the village of Barovia, shrouded in mist and bereft of walls and defenses. The dark silhouette of Castle Ravenloft looks down on this village from its perch atop a 1,000-foot-high column of rock known as the Pillarstone of Ravenloft.": "斯瓦利奇森林的常青树爬上了包围山谷的山的两侧。这些山峰中最大的是巴拉托克山，山顶白雪覆盖，山坡崎岖。巴拉托克山的孪生兄弟加基斯山略小，大部分是光秃秃的，这里和那里都有一丛丛的树木。在这两座山之间矗立着扎罗维奇湖，湖水从巴拉托克山的山面倾泻而下，冰冷无比。湖的南面是瓦拉基镇，由栅栏围住。在这两座山的西边，在一座山顶上，矗立着圣马科维亚修道院，巴罗维亚人在其周围建造了一个名为克雷兹克的围墙村庄。在瓦拉基和克雷兹克之间是阿金沃斯霍尔特的废墟，这是一个名为银龙骑士团的堕落堡垒，被斯特拉赫和他的军队消灭了。山脉以东是巴罗维亚（Barovia）村，笼罩在迷雾之中，没有城墙和防御设施。拉文洛夫特城堡（Castle Ravenloft）的黑暗轮廓从1000英尺高的石柱上俯视着这个村庄，它被称为拉文洛夫特的柱石。",

	"When a humanoid who has been dead for at least 24 hours returns to life, either by way of a spell or some supernatural means, it gains a random form of indefinite madness brought on by the realization that its spirit is trapped in Barovia, likely forever.

	"After his armies occupied the valley and slew its inhabitants, Strahd repopulated the area with human subjects drawn from his other conquered lands. As a result, Barovians have a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds.": "在他的军队占领山谷并杀害其居民后，斯特拉赫特用从他的其他被征服的土地上抽调的人类臣民重新填充该地区。因此，巴罗维亚人有各种各样的种族背景。",
	"Barovians are deeply invested in their homes and their traditions. They are wary of strange peoples and customs. The way Barovians deal with strangers can be unsettling to those newcomers. Barovians have a tendency to stare openly, in silence, thereby expressing their disapproval of anything that isn't familiar to them. Barovians aren't talkative with strangers, to the extent of being pointedly rude. Most Barovians have violent tempers that boil up through their customary silence when they are provoked. They also have a social cohesiveness (thrust upon them by their weird circumstances) that can make them act together against outsiders if a Barovian is mistreated.": "巴罗维亚人对他们的家园和传统有着深厚的感情。他们对陌生的民族和习俗保持警惕。巴罗维亚人与陌生人打交道的方式会让那些新来者感到不安。巴罗维亚人有一种在沉默中公开凝视的倾向，从而表达了他们对任何不熟悉的事物的不认可。巴罗维亚人对陌生人不善言辞，甚至到了尖锐无礼的程度。大多数巴罗维亚人都有暴躁的脾气，当他们被激怒时，会通过习惯性的沉默而沸腾起来。他们也有一种社会凝聚力（由他们奇怪的环境推给他们的），如果一个巴罗维亚人受到虐待，他们会一起行动起来反对外来者。",

They experience little hope or joy, and they are taught to fear the devil Strahd above all.": "巴罗维亚的孩子并不是快乐的孩子。他们在恐惧的文化中长大，一次又一次地被告知不要离家太远或进入森林。他们很少体验到希望或快乐，他们被教导要敬畏恶魔斯特拉赫特。",
	"Barovian adults eke out modest livings. With no new wealth pouring into the valley, they trade in old coins that bear the profile of their dark lord, Strahd, as he looked when he was alive. They hide their precious baubles in their houses and dress plainly outdoors, so as not to attract the attention of Strahd or his spies.": "巴罗维亚的成年人只能勉强维持生计。由于没有新的财富涌入山谷，他们以旧币交易，这些旧币上印有他们的黑暗主宰斯特拉赫特活着时的轮廓。他们把珍贵的饰品藏在家里，在户外穿着朴素，以免引起斯特拉赫特或其间谍的注意。",
	"Barovians live within a closed ecosystem. Every Barovian adult is expected to learn a trade or serve a function.

	"When a being with a soul dies in Barovia, that soul remains trapped in Strahd's domain until it is reincarnated in a newborn. It can take decades for a bodiless soul to find a host, and Barovians who share the same soul over generations tend to look alike. That is why {@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS} looks exactly like Strahd's beloved Tatyana—both women were born with the same soul.": "当一个有灵魂的人在巴罗维亚死亡时，他的灵魂会被困于斯特拉赫特的领域，直到转世到一个新生儿身上。无躯体的灵魂可能需要数十年才能找到宿主，而世代共享同一灵魂的巴罗维亚人往往长得很像。这就是为什么{@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS}看起来和斯特拉赫特心爱的塔蒂亚娜一模一样--两个女人都是用同一个灵魂出生的。",
	"Strahd needs loyal subjects to feed his ego. Barovians without souls are empty shells created by his consciousness to fill out the local population. Although they are physically indistinguishable from Barovians with souls, they tend to be bereft of charm and imagination and to be more compliant and depressed than the others. They dress in drab clothing, whereas Barovians who have souls wear clothes with a splash of color or individuality.": "斯特拉特需要忠诚的臣民来满足他的自大。没有灵魂的巴罗维亚人是他的意识创造出来的空壳，用来充实当地的人口。虽然他们在身体上与有灵魂的巴罗维亚人没有区别，但他们往往缺乏魅力和想象力，而且比其他人更顺从和抑郁。他们穿着单调的衣服，而拥有灵魂的巴罗维亚人则穿着带有色彩或个性的衣服。",
	"A Barovian woman, soulless or not, can give birth. A child born in Barovia might have a soul even if one or both parents do not. Conversely, the child of two parents with souls isn't certain to have a soul of its own. Barovians without souls are maudlin folk who experience fear but neither laugh nor cry.": "一个巴罗维亚的女人，无论是否没有灵魂，都可以生孩子。在巴罗维亚出生的孩子可能有一个灵魂，即使父母一方或双方都没有。相反，父母双方都有灵魂的孩子也不一定会有自己的灵魂。没有灵魂的巴罗维亚人是个苦闷的人，他们经历过恐惧，但既不笑也不哭。",
	"{@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS} and her brother Ismark both have souls, as do all Vistani. Which Barovians have souls and which don't is left up to you.": "{@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS}和她的兄弟伊斯马克都有灵魂，所有维斯坦人都有。哪些巴罗维亚人有灵魂，哪些没有，由你自己决定。",
	"Strahd periodically feeds on the blood of Barovians who have souls, but he can't draw nourishment from the blood of the soulless. He can tell at a glance whether a Barovian has a soul or is merely a shell.": "斯特拉特定期吸食有灵魂的巴罗维亚人的血液，但他无法从没有灵魂的人的血液中吸取养分。他一眼就能看出一个巴罗维亚人是否有灵魂或只是一个躯壳。",

	"Aside from the secretive dusk elves of Vallaki (see {@adventure chapter 5|CoS|6}), the only nonhumans most Barovians are familiar with are the adventurers that Strahd has lured to his dark realm. Barovians thus react to nonhuman characters the same way most humans in the real world would react to elf, dwarf, or half-orc adventurers suddenly walking the streets. Most such outsiders are scorned, feared, or shunned.": "除了瓦拉基的神秘黄昏精灵（见{@adventure chapter 5|CoS|6}），大多数巴罗维亚人唯一熟悉的非人类是斯特拉赫引诱到他的黑暗领域的冒险家。因此，巴罗维亚人对非人类角色的反应与现实世界中大多数人类对突然走在街上的精灵、矮人或半兽人冒险家的反应一样。大多数这样的外来者都被蔑视、恐惧或回避。",

	"Vistani are silversmiths, coppersmiths, haberdashers, cooks, weavers, musicians, entertainers, storytellers, toolmakers, and horse traders.

	"Each family or clan of Vistani is its own little gerontocracy, with the oldest member ruling the roost.

	"During one of Strahd's military campaigns, years before he became a vampire, a group of Vistani rescued him after he was wounded in battle. These Vistani not only nursed Strahd back to health but also delivered him safely home.

	"In the centuries since Strahd became a vampire, many Vistani have allowed themselves to be corrupted by Strahd, to the extent that they consider him their king. Vistani who serve Strahd are less lively and friendly than normal Vistani, and their hearts are poisoned with dark intentions.

These Vistani will lie to protect the vampire, and they fear the consequences of disobeying him.": "在斯特拉赫成为吸血鬼后的几个世纪里，许多维斯坦人允许自己被斯特拉赫腐蚀，以至于将他视为自己的国王。为斯特拉赫服务的维斯坦人没有普通维斯坦人那么活泼友好，他们的心被黑暗的意图所毒害。斯特拉特利用他们来引诱冒险者进入他的领地，并让他了解在他管辖范围以外的土地上发生的事件。这些维斯特人为了保护吸血鬼会撒谎，他们害怕违背他的后果。",
	"When it comes to sharing information about their dark master, Strahd's Vistani pretend to be helpful, but the information they impart is misleading at best and often deceptive. They readily tell adventurers that they have a potion that protects them from the deadly fog that surrounds Barovia. Although this is a lie, they attempt to sell their fake potion for as much money as they can get.": "在分享有关其黑暗主人的信息时，斯特拉赫的维斯坦人假装乐于助人，但他们传授的信息充其量是误导性的，而且往往具有欺骗性。他们轻易地告诉冒险者，他们有一种药水，可以保护他们不受环绕巴罗维亚的致命雾气的影响。虽然这是个谎言，但他们试图以尽可能多的钱出售他们的假药水。",

A lit hallway to the south contains another set of bronze doors, through which you hear sad and majestic organ tones.": "蜘蛛网在柱子之间延伸，这些柱子支撑着一个巨大的、布满灰尘的大厅的拱形天花板，铁制的壁炉中溅出的火把照得很暗。火把在八个石雕的脸上投下奇怪的影子，这些石雕一动不动地蹲在圆顶的边缘上。开裂和褪色的天花板壁画被腐烂所覆盖。东面的青铜双门紧闭。在北面，一个宽大的楼梯爬上了黑暗。南面有一条亮着的走廊，里面有另一组青铜门，透过这些门，你会听到悲伤而雄伟的风琴声。",

	"Torchlight flutters against the walls of this vaulted hall. To the east, an arched hallway stretches for twenty feet, ending at a spiral staircase that goes up and down. Next to the hallway, a suit of armor, oiled and glistening, stands at attention in a shallow alcove. To the west, large double doors hang slightly open, and a steady bright light escapes through the opening. Swells of organ music come from behind the doors, spilling their melody of power and defeat into the hall.": "火把光在这个拱形大厅的墙壁上飘动。在东边，一条拱形的走廊延伸了20英尺，在一个上上下下的螺旋形楼梯上结束。走廊旁边，一套上了油的、闪闪发光的盔甲站在一个浅浅的凹槽里，一动不动。在西边，大的双扇门微微敞开，稳定的亮光从开口处射出。大门后面传来阵阵的管风琴音乐，将其力量和失败的旋律洒向大厅。",

The table is laden with many delectable foods: roasted beast basted in a savory sauce, roots and herbs of every taste, and sweet fruits and vegetables. Places are set for each of you with fine, delicate china and silver. At each place is a crystal goblet filled with an amber liquid with a delicate, tantalizing fragrance.": "三盏巨大的水晶吊灯辉煌地照亮了这个宏伟的房间。石柱矗立在暗淡的白色大理石墙壁上，支撑着天花板。在房间的中央，一张沉重的长桌子上铺着一块精美的白缎布。桌子上摆放着许多美味的食物：用美味的酱汁烤制的野味，各种口味的根茎和草药，以及甜美的水果和蔬菜。你们每个人的位置都是用精致的瓷器和银器摆放的。每个位置都有一个水晶高脚杯，里面装着琥珀色的液体，散发着精致诱人的香味。",
	"At the center of the far west wall, between floor-to-ceiling mirrors, stands a massive organ. Its pipes blare out a thunderous melody that speaks in its tone of greatness and despair. Seated at the organ, facing away from you, a single caped figure pounds the keys in raptured ecstasy. The figure suddenly stops, and as a deep silence falls over the dining hall, it slowly turns toward you.": "在最西边的墙壁中央，落地镜之间，矗立着一架巨大的风琴。它的管子响起了雷鸣般的旋律，用它的语气诉说着伟大和绝望。坐在风琴前，面对着你，一个戴着帽子的人在狂喜地敲打着琴键。这个身影突然停了下来，当深沉的寂静笼罩着整个餐厅时，它慢慢地转向了你。",
	"The figure is an illusion of Strahd. It welcomes the characters and invites them to dine. The illusion acts like Strahd and plays the part of the gracious host, speaking kindly and telling the characters that they're free to explore the castle. \"Strahd\" might talk about his family or shed light on the castle's history, but the illusion provides no useful information about the castle's inhabitants, treasures, or dangers other than to say that the castle doesn't receive many guests. The illusory vampire converses with the characters for no more than 3 rounds, never moving from the organ bench. When the time is up, or if the illusion is attacked, it simply disappears with a mocking laugh.": "这个人物是斯特拉赫特的幻影。它欢迎这些人物，并邀请他们用餐。幻象表现得像斯特拉赫特，扮演着亲切的主人的角色，说话和蔼可亲，告诉人物他们可以自由探索城堡。\"斯特拉赫特 \"可能会谈论他的家庭，或阐明城堡的历史，但这个幻象没有提供关于城堡居民、宝藏或危险的有用信息，只是说城堡不接待很多客人。虚幻的吸血鬼与人物交谈的时间不超过3个回合，从不离开风琴凳。当时间到了，或者如果幻象被攻击了，它就会带着嘲弄的笑声消失了。",
	"The moment the figure disappears, a fierce, bone-chilling wind rises up and roars through the hall, putting out all open flames. The characters hear the screech of ancient hinges and the solid thud of many heavy doors slamming shut, one after another, into the distance. They also hear the portcullis clang shut and the tired groan of the aged drawbridge pulling up. Finally, unless the doors to this room are being held open, they slam shut (but do not lock). If the characters open the doors, they see that all the torches in areas K7, K8, and K9 have gone out.": "在这个人影消失的那一刻，一股猛烈的、刺骨的寒风升起，在大厅里咆哮，扑灭了所有的明火。角色们听到了古老的铰链的尖叫声和许多沉重的门砰然关上的坚实声响，一个接一个地传向远方。他们还听到了门闩哐当一声关上，以及老化的吊桥拉起时发出的疲惫呻吟。最后，除非这个房间的门被撑开，否则它们会砰然关上（但不锁）。如果人物打开门，他们会看到K7、K8和K9区域的所有火把都熄灭了。",
	"The organ appears locked in place and immovable, but a character who makes a successful DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check notices scratch marks on the floor that suggest that the organ can be slid outward. A character who tries pushing various keys and pedals discovers that one of the pedals, when depressed, causes the organ to slide outward about 2 feet, allowing access to a secret door in the back wall that swings open into area K11. Because this secret door is hidden behind the organ, it can't be found and opened until the organ is moved out of the way.": "这架风琴似乎被锁在原地，无法动弹，但如果有人成功地进行了DC20智慧({@skill Perception})检查，就会发现地板上有划痕，表明这架风琴可以向外滑动。试图按动各种键和踏板的人物发现，其中一个踏板在被按下时，会使风琴向外滑动约2英尺，从而可以进入后墙的一个秘密门，该门可以旋转着进入K11区。由于这扇秘密门藏在风琴后面，所以除非风琴被移开，否则无法找到和打开。",

	"{@creature Gertruda|CoS} is innocent, and years spent as a shut-in have twisted her sense of reality. Consequently, she maintains a fairy-tale view of life.

Fortunately for her, Strahd has not yet bitten her, though he intends to. (If he can do so while the characters look on helplessly, so much the better.)": "{@creature Gertruda|CoS}是无辜的，多年来的闭门造车扭曲了她的现实感。因此，她对生活保持一种童话般的看法。当面临一个决定时，她几乎总是做出最简单的选择。她天真到对自己和他人都很危险的地步。幸运的是，斯特拉赫还没有咬她，尽管他打算咬她。(如果他能在人物无助地看着的时候咬她，那就更好了）。",

The block weighs thousands of tons and pulverizes anything in the space where it comes to rest.": "在电梯上升的同时，一个10英尺长的花岗岩立方体被悬挂在沉重的链条上，在竖井的东半部下降，充当配重。这块巨大的石块轻轻地落在井底，填满了电梯旁边先前开放的10英尺乘10英尺的空间。这块石头重达数千吨，在它落下的空间里，任何东西都会被碾碎。",

	"The dragon, who called himself Argynvost, had come to the valley years earlier in the guise of a nobleman named Lord Argynvost. The dragon didn't lair in the valley solely because of its idyllic beauty. He knew of a place called the Amber Temple—a repository of evil power guarded by the forces of good. Argynvost wanted to make sure that whatever was trapped inside the Amber Temple wouldn't be allowed to escape, so he built his fortified mansion, Argynvostholt, close by.": "这条自称Argynvost的龙，多年前曾以一个名叫Argynvost勋爵的贵族的身份来到山谷中。这条龙在山谷中筑巢，并不只是因为它的田园风光。他知道有一个叫琥珀神殿的地方--一个由正义力量守护的邪恶力量的宝库。Argynvost想确保被困在琥珀神庙里的东西不会被允许逃跑，所以他在附近建造了他的坚固的豪宅，Argynvostholt。",
	"Like many silver dragons, Argynvost was extraordinarily wealthy, and he was comfortable living among humans while disguised as one of them.

	"During the war between Strahd and his foes, the Order of the Silver Dragon drove away malefactors searching for the Amber Temple. It also sheltered Strahd's enemies and proved more than a match for Strahd's battle-weary soldiers. But the early victories of the order didn't win the war. Even with Argynvost on their side, the knights were ultimately overwhelmed when Strahd's reinforcements swept into the valley. Those forces slew the last of the knights and battled the dragon inside Argynvostholt. After the dragon was slain, Strahd had its corpse hacked to pieces, stripped to the bone, and transported to Castle Ravenloft as a trophy.": "在斯特拉赫特和他的敌人之间的战争中，银龙骑士团赶走了寻找琥珀神殿的歹徒。它还庇护了斯特拉赫特的敌人，并证明比斯特拉赫特疲于奔命的士兵更胜一筹。但秩序的早期胜利并没有赢得战争。即使有阿尔金沃斯特（Argynvost）站在他们一边，当斯特拉赫特的援军涌入山谷时，骑士们最终还是被淹没了。这些部队杀死了最后一批骑士，并与阿金沃斯霍特内部的龙进行了战斗。龙被杀死后，斯特拉赫特把它的尸体砍成碎片，剥得精光，并作为战利品运到雷文洛夫特城堡。",

Consumed by hatred, the knights have lost their honor and nobility. Their redemption hinges on whether Vladimir can set aside that hatred. The undead knight can be found brooding in the ruins of Argynvostholt.": "收到这个消息后，弗拉基米尔停止了前进，带领他的骑士们回到了阿金沃斯霍特。他意识到，斯特拉赫特已经死了，并被诅咒到他自己创造的地狱。由于无处可去，无事可做，弗拉基米尔让他的骑士们去杀死斯特拉赫特的代理人和其他任何可能帮助缓解斯特拉赫特痛苦的人。骑士们被仇恨吞噬，失去了他们的荣誉和贵族身份。他们的救赎取决于弗拉基米尔是否能放下仇恨。这位不死的骑士可以在阿金沃斯霍特的废墟中找到他的身影。",
	"The spirit of the dragon Argynvost isn't at rest, either. It can sense that the knights have been corrupted, and it reaches out to the characters, hoping they will help the knights find peace. If the characters retrieve the dragon's skull from Castle Ravenloft and place it in the mausoleum of Argynvostholt, the dragon's spirit ascends to the highest tower of the mansion and transforms into a beacon of light that flashes across Barovia. The light of the beacon reminds {@creature Vladimir Horngaard|CoS} of what he has lost, enabling him and his fellow knights to let go of their hatred and find both redemption and rest.": "龙Argynvost的灵魂也没有安息。它能感觉到骑士们已经被腐蚀了，它向人物伸出了手，希望他们能帮助骑士们找到和平。如果角色们从雷文洛夫特城堡取回龙的头骨，并把它放在阿金沃斯霍特的陵墓里，龙的灵魂就会升到大宅的最高塔上，变成一盏灯塔，闪耀在巴罗维亚。烽火台的光芒提醒{@creature Vladimir Horngaard|CoS}他所失去的东西，使他和他的同伴们能够放下仇恨，找到救赎和休息。",

They believed that an ancient god gave up his divinity to preserve the world from destruction and that his last exhalation as a god produced this mist. Within it were all his memories of the world and all his visions of its possible futures, and with proper preparation, a seeker could go on a vision quest within it. Some students of the arcane contend that the Dark Powers took a bit of that fog and twisted it to create the mists of Barovia, and that perhaps Strahd's domain is just a dark memory in the Whispering Wall.": "如果人物向NPC施法者询问这部分雾墙的情况，那个人可能会讲述一个关于它的古老传说。根据巴罗维亚的山民们的说法，在耶斯特山附近一直有一堵雾墙，甚至在致命的迷雾困住整个巴罗维亚之前就有。古代人把这堵雾墙称为 \"低语墙\"，因为在这堵墙里，他们可以听到来自过去和未来的声音的低语。他们相信，一位古神放弃了他的神性，以保护世界免于毁灭，他作为神的最后一次呼气产生了这团雾。在这里面有他对世界的所有记忆和他对世界可能的未来的所有设想，如果有适当的准备，探索者可以在里面进行视觉探索。一些研究奥术的学生认为，黑暗势力从那片雾气中抽取了一点，并将其扭曲，创造了巴罗维亚的迷雾，也许斯特拉赫特的领域只是低语之墙中的一段黑暗记忆。",

	"If the characters take the children to Krezk, the villagers there look after the children and see that they are fed and properly clothed.

	"A light flashes behind you. Wheeling around, you see a stately man—a being of flesh and blood—in shining armor and a flapping cape. His countenance shows great strength of will, yet the forcefulness of his presence is tempered by his calm, sad eyes. His features are those of Strahd, yet subtly different.": "一道光在你身后闪过。转过身来，你看到一个庄严的人--一个有血有肉的人，穿着闪亮的盔甲，披着飘扬的斗篷。他的面容显示出强大的意志力，但他平静、悲伤的眼神使他的力量得到了缓和。他的特征是斯特拉赫特的特征，但又有微妙的不同。",

	"Shimmering light surrounds Ireena and Sergei. Hand in hand, they walk east toward the edge of the overlook. Their feet do not touch the ground as they tread a path beyond this mortal world. Their invisible road takes them beyond the eastern precipice, their glow illuminating and thinning the clouds above Barovia. The clouds suddenly break open, letting shafts of glorious sunlight flood through. In the valley below, the strange fog dissolves. Barovia is free once more.": "波光粼粼的光线围绕着伊丽娜和谢尔盖。他们手拉手，向东走去，走向眺望台的边缘。他们的脚没有接触到地面，因为他们踏上了一条超越这个凡人世界的道路。他们无形的道路把他们带到了东部的悬崖之外，他们的光芒照亮了巴罗维亚上空的云层并使之变薄。云层突然裂开，让灿烂的阳光照射进来。在下面的山谷里，奇怪的雾气消失了。巴罗维亚再次获得了自由。",
	"Strahd's death grants Barovia a reprieve. The fog that surrounds the land thins, and it no longer harms those who pass through it. The dark clouds that have loomed over the valley for centuries give way to sunshine, shocking the Barovians out of their despair.": "斯特拉赫的死亡给了巴罗维亚一个喘息的机会。围绕着这片土地的雾气逐渐稀薄，它不再伤害那些通过它的人。几个世纪以来笼罩着山谷的乌云让位给了阳光，使巴罗维亚人从绝望中惊醒。",
	"The Barovians take the sunlight as a sign that the evil in their land has been purged. Though escape is now possible, most Barovians realize that they have nowhere to go and no reason to leave. A few depart, fearing the return of the darkness or longing to see their ancestral homelands. Those who have souls can leave the valley, while those without souls fade into nothingness as they take their first steps beyond the edge of Strahd's former domain.": "巴罗维亚人把阳光看作是他们土地上的邪恶已经被清除的标志。虽然现在可以逃跑了，但大多数巴罗维亚人意识到他们无处可去，也没有理由离开。少数人离开了，他们害怕黑暗的回归，或者渴望看到他们祖先的家园。那些有灵魂的人可以离开山谷，而那些没有灵魂的人在走出斯特拉赫特以前的领地边缘时，会逐渐消失在虚无之中。",
	"The bats, wolves, and dire wolves of Barovia lose their supernatural link to Strahd upon his destruction and become ordinary beasts, destined to be hunted down or driven to the farthest reaches of the Svalich Woods.": "巴罗维亚的蝙蝠、狼和地狼在斯特拉赫特毁灭后失去了与他的超自然联系，变成了普通的野兽，注定要被猎杀或被赶到斯瓦里奇森林的最远处。",
	"Even after Strahd's death, Castle Ravenloft remains a haunted place shunned by all Barovians. Its dark immensity and threatening countenance are enough to deter locals from plundering or reoccupying it.": "即使在斯特拉赫特死后，雷文洛夫特城堡仍然是所有巴罗维亚人避之不及的鬼地方。其黑暗的面积和威胁性的面孔足以让当地人不敢掠夺或重新占领它。",

	"If he is still alive, {@creature Rictavio|CoS|Rudolph van Richten} (see \"{@area Rictavio|7b8|x}\" in appendix D) leaves Barovia to live out his remaining days in solitude. His protégé, {@creature Ezmerelda d'Avenir|CoS} (see {@adventure appendix D|CoS|21|Ezmerelda d'Avenir}), isn't convinced that Strahd is truly dead.

	"Ezmerelda's suspicion proves justified. Strahd's destruction is temporary, for his curse can't so easily be ended. The ancient Dark Powers with which Strahd forged his pact cause the vampire to re-form after a period of months—long enough for the Barovians to discover what it feels like to live a life of hope. When Strahd is reborn, the mists surround the land of Barovia once more, and the Barovians' hope turns to horrible despair. Strahd remembers the defeat dealt to him and begins plotting his revenge.": "事实证明，Ezmerelda的怀疑是合理的。斯特拉特的毁灭是暂时的，因为他的诅咒不可能那么容易结束。与斯特拉赫特签订契约的古老黑暗力量使吸血鬼在几个月后重新形成，这足以让巴罗维亚人发现生活在希望中的感觉。当斯特拉赫特重生后，迷雾再次包围了巴罗维亚的土地，巴罗维亚人的希望变成了可怕的绝望。斯特拉特记住了他的失败，开始策划他的复仇。",
	"After the mists reappear, {@creature Madam Eva|CoS} and her Vistani come back to the valley, the beasts of the land once more fall under Strahd's spell, and the burgomasters fortify their settlements, hoping against all hope that someone can save them from Strahd again.": "迷雾重现后，{@creature Madam Eva|CoS}和她的维斯坦尼人又来到了山谷，这片土地上的野兽再次陷入了斯特拉赫特的魔咒，城主们加固了他们的定居点，不抱任何希望地希望有人能再次从斯特拉赫特手中拯救他们。",

It is appropriate for any character or campaign associaed with eeriness or horror.": "在创建角色的过程中，玩家可以在你的同意下，为他们的角色选择以下背景。{@background Haunted One|vrgr}. 它适合于任何与阴森或恐怖有关的角色或活动。",
	"Before the characters can explore the haunted townhouse known as Death House, you need to guide them to the village of Barovia. The \"{@area Creeping Fog|09e|x}\" adventure hook in chapter 1 works best, as it introduces few distractions. Once the characters arrive in Strahd's domain, steer them to the village. For the duration of this introductory adventure, any attempt by the characters to explore other locations in Strahd's domain causes the mists of Ravenloft to block their path.": "在人物探索被称为 \"死亡之屋 \"的鬼屋之前，你需要引导他们到巴罗维亚村。第一章中的\"{@area Creeping Fog|09e|x} \"冒险钩子效果最好，因为它引入的干扰很少。一旦人物到达斯特拉赫特的领地，就引导他们去村庄。在这个介绍性的冒险过程中，如果角色试图探索斯特拉赫特领地的其他地点，就会被雷文洛夫特的迷雾挡住去路。",

	"Death House is the name given to an old row house in the village of Barovia ({@area area E7|168|x} on the {@area village map|143|x}). The house has been burned to the ground many times, only to rise from the ashes time and again—by its own will or that of Strahd. Locals give the building a wide berth for fear of antagonizing the evil spirits believed to haunt it.": "死亡之屋是巴罗维亚村（{@area area E7|168|x}上{@area village map|143|x}）的一座老式排屋的名字。这座房子曾多次被烧成灰烬，只是一次又一次地从灰烬中复活--这是它自己的意愿或斯特拉赫特的意愿。当地人对这栋建筑敬而远之，生怕惹恼了据说在这里出没的恶灵。",
	"The wealthy family that built the house practiced the dark arts. Through seduction and indoctrination, they expanded their cult to include a small yet nefarious circle of friends. When word got out, the rest of the village turned a blind eye to the house and the nightly debaucheries happening within it.": "建造这所房子的富人家庭奉行黑暗艺术。通过引诱和灌输，他们扩大了他们的邪教，包括一个小而邪恶的朋友圈。当消息传出后，村子里的其他人对这所房子和其中发生的夜间放荡行为视而不见。",
	"The cult tried to summon malevolent extraplanar entities with no success. The cultists also preyed on visitors, sacrificed them in bizarre rituals, and hosted morbid banquets to feast on their corpses. When nothing came of these ritualized murders, the cultists' activities became thinly disguised excuses to indulge their lurid fantasies. The ranks of the cult thinned as members began to lose interest in the debacle.": "该邪教试图召唤恶意的星外实体，但没有成功。邪教分子还掠夺游客，在怪异的仪式中牺牲他们，并举办病态的宴会，在他们的尸体上大吃一顿。当这些仪式化的谋杀案没有任何结果时，邪教分子的活动就成了薄薄的借口，让他们沉浸在自己的淫秽幻想中。随着成员们开始对这场灾难失去兴趣，邪教的队伍逐渐稀少。",
	"Then {@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS} arrived.": "然后{@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS}到达。",
	"The cultists regarded Strahd as a messiah sent to them by the Dark Powers. Drawn to Strahd like moths to a flame, they pledged their devotion for a promise of immortality, but Strahd turned them away, deeming the cult and its leaders unworthy of his attention. The cultists withdrew to Death House in despair.": "崇拜者认为斯特拉赫特是黑暗势力派来的救世主。他们像飞蛾扑火一样被斯特拉赫吸引，为获得不朽的承诺而献身，但斯特拉赫将他们拒之门外，认为该教派及其领导人不值得他关注。崇拜者们在绝望中撤回了死亡之屋。",
	"The cult's habit of trapping and devouring wayward visitors proved to be its downfall. On one occasion, the cult snared a band of adventurers whom Strahd had lured to his domain to be his playthings. A black carriage arrived at Death House soon thereafter, and from out of its black heart stepped the vampire himself. The cultists tried to impress Strahd. In response, he slaughtered them for slaying his playthings. Centuries later, the cultists' spirits haunt the dungeons under the house. The building itself, it seems, is unwilling to let the cult be forgotten.": "事实证明，邪教诱捕和吞噬不速之客的习惯是其失败的原因。有一次，邪教诱捕了一队被斯特拉赫特引诱到他的领地做玩物的冒险者。此后不久，一辆黑色的马车来到了死亡之屋，从它的黑色心脏中走出了吸血鬼本人。崇拜者们试图讨好斯特拉赫特。作为回应，他屠杀了他们，因为他们杀了他的玩物。几个世纪后，这些邪教徒的灵魂在房子下面的地牢里出没。这座建筑本身似乎也不愿意让邪教被遗忘。",

	"In truth, this \"virtuous\" calling began as an obsessive effort to destroy a vampire that murdered my child, and it has become for me a tedious and bleak career.

Like a regretful lich, I find myself inexorably bound to an existence I sought out of madness and, seemingly, must now endure for all eternity. Of course I shall die, but whether I shall ever rest in my grave haunts my idle thoughts, and torments me in my dreams.": "事实上，这种 \"美德 \"的呼唤开始于消灭一个谋杀我孩子的吸血鬼的执着努力，对我来说，它已经成为一个乏味而暗淡的职业。即使在我猎杀怪物的生活开始时，我也感到时间的重量压在我疲惫的肩膀上。今天，我是一个简直活得太久的人。就像一个后悔的巫师，我发现自己不可避免地被束缚在我因疯狂而寻求的存在中，而且，似乎现在必须永远忍受下去。我当然会死，但我是否能在坟墓中安息，困扰着我的闲思，并在梦中折磨着我。",

Rather, I come to grips with a devastating realization: I now see that I am the object of a baleful Vistani curse. More tragically, the nature of this hex is such that I have not borne the brunt of it; instead, far worse, those who surround me have fallen victim to it!": "我希望那些认为我是英雄的人在知道我作为非自然界猎手的全部真相后会改变他们的想法。然而，我必须在这里和现在透露，我是许多人死亡的间接原因，也是许多好朋友的损失。不要误解我! 我不只是为自己感到遗憾。相反，我意识到了一个毁灭性的认识。我现在看到，我是一个可恶的维斯坦人诅咒的对象。更可悲的是，这个魔咒的性质决定了我并没有首当其冲；相反，更糟糕的是，我身边的人都成了它的受害者。",

	"In fact, the Vistani took Erasmus with my own, unwitting permission. They had brought an extremely ill member of their tribe to me one evening and insisted that I treat him, but I was unable to save the young man's life. In fear of their retribution, I begged the Vistani to take anything of mine if only they would withhold their terrifying powers, of which I knew nothing. To my lasting astonishment, they chose to surreptitiously take my son in exchange for their loss! By the time I realized what had occurred, they were already an hour gone.": "事实上，维斯坦尼人在我不知情的情况下带走了伊拉斯谟。一天晚上，他们把一个病得很重的部落成员带到我面前，坚持要我为他治疗，但我无法挽救这个年轻人的生命。由于害怕他们的报复，我恳求维斯坦尼人接受我的任何东西，只要他们能保留他们可怕的力量，而我对此一无所知。令我长久以来感到惊讶的是，他们选择偷偷地带走我的儿子，以换取他们的损失。当我意识到发生了什么时，他们已经走了一个小时。",
	"Incensed beyond reason, I strapped the body of the dead young man to my horse and doggedly followed the Vistani caravan through the woods, naively allowing the sun to set before me without seeking shelter from the night. Shortly after darkness fell, I was beset by undead that would have slain me, had not their master—a lich—intervened and spared my life, for reasons that I do not completely understand. He somehow detected me and, with his powerful magic, took control of a pack of zombies that wandered in the forest. He spoke to me through the mouths of the dead things and placed a magic ward against undead on me, then animated the dead Vistana and bade it tell me where I could find its people. Unfortunately (I say in hindsight), the plan worked. I found the child-stealers, and my unwelcome entourage included a growing horde of voracious undead that could not touch me, thanks to the lich's ward.": "我被激怒了，把那个死去的年轻人的尸体绑在马背上，顽强地跟着维斯坦人的商队穿过树林，天真地让太阳在我面前落下，而不去寻求夜的庇护。黑夜降临后不久，我就被亡灵围住了，如果不是它们的主人--利希--介入并饶了我一命，出于我不完全理解的原因，它们会杀了我。他以某种方式发现了我，并以他强大的魔法控制了一群在森林里游荡的僵尸。他通过死物的嘴和我说话，在我身上放了一个防止亡灵的魔法罩，然后让死去的维斯塔纳活了过来，并让它告诉我在哪里可以找到它的人。不幸的是（我事后说），这个计划成功了。我找到了偷孩子的人，而我不受欢迎的随行人员包括越来越多的贪婪的亡灵，由于巫师的防护罩，它们无法触及我。",
	"When I found the caravan, I threatened to set the zombies on the Vistani unless they returned my dear boy. They replied that he had been sold to the vampire, Baron Metus. Something inside me snapped. I released the zombies, and the entire tribe was eaten alive.": "当我找到商队时，我威胁说，如果他们不归还我亲爱的孩子，我就把僵尸放在维斯坦尼人身上。他们回答说，他已经被卖给了吸血鬼梅图斯男爵。我内心的某些东西突然爆发了。我释放了僵尸，整个部落都被活活吃掉了。",
	"Yet the story has not ended. Before she died, the leader cursed me, saying, \"Live you always among monsters, and see everyone you love die beneath their claws!\" Even now, so many years later, I can hear her words with painful clarity. A short time later, I found my dear Erasmus made into a vampire. He begged me to end his curse, which I did with a heavy heart. The darkness had torn him from my loving arms forever, and I foolishly believed that the curse had exacted its deadly toll. I wept until an insatiate desire for vengeance filled the bottomless rift in my heart.": "然而故事并没有结束。在她死之前，领袖诅咒我说：\"你要永远生活在怪物之中，看到你所爱的每个人都死在他们的爪下！\" 即使是现在，这么多年过去了，我还能清楚地听到她的话，很痛苦。不久之后，我发现我亲爱的伊拉斯谟变成了一个吸血鬼。他恳求我结束他的诅咒，我怀着沉重的心情做了这件事。黑暗把他从我爱的怀抱中永远地撕开了，我愚蠢地认为诅咒已经造成了致命的损失。我哭了起来，直到一种贪得无厌的复仇欲望填满了我心中无底的裂缝。",
