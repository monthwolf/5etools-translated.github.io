	"The Forgotten Realms is a world of high fantasy, populated by elves, dwarves, halflings, humans, and other folk—one of many such worlds in the vast multiverse of the D&D game. In the Realms, fighters dare the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate.

	"The roads and rivers of the Realms carry minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers and sailors. Bold adventurers follow tales of strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can take even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world, but these paths are never safe. Travelers in the Realms face fell magic and deadly monsters. Even farms and freeholds a day's walk from a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the wrath of a dragon.": "在王国的道路和河流上，吟游诗人和小贩、商人和卫兵、士兵和水手都在这里。大胆的冒险家们追寻着奇怪的、光荣的、遥远的地方的故事。好的地图和清晰的路径甚至可以把一个没有经验的年轻人带向世界的远方，但这些道路从来都不安全。境界中的旅行者面临着堕落的魔法和致命的怪物。即使是离城市只有一天路程的农场和土地，也可能成为怪物的猎物，没有一个地方能免遭龙的愤怒。",
	"This adventure takes place on Stormwreck Isle, a small island in a region called the Sword Coast. This region is a place of adventure, where daring souls delve into ancient strongholds and explore the ruins of long-lost kingdoms.

	"If you have fewer than four players, you can have some players take on the role of two characters so the group has at least four characters.

	"According to legend, two families of dragons came into being in the very first days of the world's creation. Bahamut, the noble Platinum Dragon, made the metallic dragons—gold, silver, bronze, brass, and copper. Cruel, five-headed Tiamat made the chromatic dragons—red, blue, green, black and white. The metallic and chromatic dragons share a mutual animosity that originates in the enmity between Bahamut and Tiamat (Bahamut is often called the King of Metallic Dragons in the world of the Forgotten Realms, and Tiamat the Queen of Chromatic Dragons. In other worlds they have different names, and like all gods, they are beyond gender.)": "根据传说，在世界诞生的最初几天，有两个龙家族诞生了。巴哈姆特，高贵的白金龙，制造了金属龙--金、银、铜、黄铜和铜。残忍的五头龙提亚马特制造了彩色的龙--红色、蓝色、绿色、黑色和白色。金属龙和彩色龙有一种共同的敌意，这种敌意源于巴哈姆特和提亚马特之间的仇恨（巴哈姆特在《被遗忘的世界》中通常被称为金属龙之王，而提亚马特是彩色龙的女王。在其他世界中，他们有不同的名字，而且像所有的神一样，他们是超越性别的。）",
	"The origin of Dragon's Rest is rooted in that animosity. Ages ago, a fire-breathing red dragon called Sharruth rampaged up and down the Sword Coast. Three metallic dragons joined forces to battle Sharruth and imprisoned her beneath the ocean floor, believing seawater would quench her fire and keep her bound forever. But Sharruth's fury, legend says, caused the undersea volcanic activity that formed Stormwreck Isle.": "龙之息的起源就源于这种敌意。几百年前，一条名叫沙鲁斯的喷火红龙在剑海岸上下肆虐。三条金属龙联合起来与沙鲁斯战斗，并将她囚禁在海底，相信海水可以熄灭她的火，让她永远被束缚。但传说中，沙鲁斯的怒火引起了海底火山活动，形成了风暴残骸岛。",
	"In all likelihood, Sharruth is long dead and entombed beneath the island, but chromatic dragons whisper that she still lives and will one day emerge from her prison. One fact is undeniable: the powerful magic embodied in such an ancient dragon has left a permanent mark on Stormwreck Isle. That magic has drawn other dragons to the island throughout the centuries, making it a recurring battlefield in the conflict between chromatic and metallic dragons. Several of these dragons have died there, each leaving behind a spiritual scar that causes unpredictable magical effects.": "在所有的可能性中，沙鲁斯早就死了，被埋在岛的下面，但半透明的龙低声说，她仍然活着，并且有一天会从她的监狱里出来。有一个事实是不可否认的：这样一条古老的龙所体现的强大魔法在风暴残骸岛上留下了永久的印记。几个世纪以来，这种魔法将其他龙吸引到岛上，使它成为色龙和金属龙之间冲突的一个反复的战场。其中有几条龙死在了那里，每条龙都留下了精神上的伤痕，造成了不可预知的魔法效果。",
	"Runara has grown weary of strife, and Stormwreck Isle's wounds are a constant reminder to her of the cost of such conflict. Devoting herself to peace and reconciliation, she established the cloister of Dragon's Rest as a safe haven from violence. Living in human guise, Runara now serves as the leader of a tiny group of hermits and ascetics.": "鲁纳拉已经厌倦了纷争，风暴残骸岛的伤痕不断提醒她这种冲突的代价。她致力于和平与和解，建立了 \"龙息 \"修道院，作为一个远离暴力的安全港。茹娜拉现在以人类的身份生活，担任一小批隐士和苦行者的领袖。",

	"In {@i Dragons of Stormwreck Isle}, the characters experience the magical scars left behind by the death of dragons.

	"You can give players a sense of how well they're doing against a creature by describing, in narrative terms, how hurt the creature is. For example, if the creature has fewer than half its hit points remaining, you can describe it as being badly wounded.

	"As they fight a creature, characters should learn more about the creature's abilities. Share information with the players as it becomes apparent. For example, if the wizard casts {@spell flaming sphere} (a spell that deals fire damage) against a {@creature fire snake} (a creature that's immune to fire damage), let the wizard's player know the spell doesn't seem to bother the creature at all. Players might correctly guess that a fire snake probably isn't harmed by fire; feel free to subtly confirm their guesses (perhaps smiling and saying, \"That sounds reasonable\").": "在与生物战斗的过程中，角色应该了解更多关于生物的能力。当信息变得明显时，与玩家分享。例如，如果巫师对{@creature fire snake}（对火伤害免疫的生物）施展{@spell flaming sphere}（造成火伤害的法术），让巫师的玩家知道这个法术似乎根本就没有影响到这个生物。玩家可能会正确地猜测火蛇可能不会受到火的伤害；可以巧妙地确认他们的猜测（也许可以微笑着说，\"这听起来很合理\"）。",

	"Place these encounters wherever you want to on the island, or use them as inspiration as you begin to craft your own adventures.": "在岛上任何你想去的地方放置这些奇遇，或者在你开始制作自己的冒险时使用它们作为灵感。",
	"This encounter poses a simple challenge for characters of 2nd level or higher, or a harder challenge for 1st-level characters. It's particularly appropriate if the characters are rowing around the island or making their way along the coast at sea level.": "这个遭遇对2级以上的角色来说是一个简单的挑战，对1级的角色来说则是更难的挑战。如果角色在岛上划船或在海平面上沿着海岸线前进，就特别合适。",
	"Billowing clouds of steam emerge from the rocks ahead, and the air grows thicker with moisture. As you round a bend, you see a cove where a hot spring burbles up from the rocks and spills into a pool before draining into the ocean. The turquoise water is luminescent, and the gray basalt edges of the spring are lined with vibrantly colored mushrooms, which occasionally burst in a shower of rainbow spores.": "前面的岩石上冒出滚滚的蒸汽云，空气中的水分越来越浓。当你转过一个弯时，你看到一个海湾，那里的温泉从岩石中喷涌而出，在排入海洋之前溢出一个水池。绿松石的水是发光的，泉水的灰色玄武岩边缘有许多颜色鲜艳的蘑菇，它们偶尔会在彩虹孢子雨中迸发出来。",
	"The spring is the site of a brass dragon's death, and life-giving magic persists at the site. A character who spends 10 minutes bathing in the waters of the spring can roll one of their Hit Dice (noted on each character sheet) and regain hit points equal to the roll plus their Constitution modifier. A character can benefit from bathing in the hot spring at most once per day.": "该泉水是一条铜龙的死亡之地，而赋予生命的魔法在该处持续存在。在温泉中浸泡10分钟的人物可以掷出他们的一个命中率骰子（在每个人物表上注明），并恢复相当于该骰子加上他们的体质修正值的命中率。一个角色每天最多可以从温泉沐浴中获益一次。",
	"This encounter poses a medium challenge for 3rd-level characters and a difficult challenge for 2nd-level characters. Use it if your group enjoys combat or the players need a chance to practice using their characters' new abilities after gaining a level. It's particularly appropriate if the characters are traveling across the island rather than following the coast.": "这个遭遇对3级的角色来说是一个中等的挑战，对2级的角色来说是一个困难的挑战。如果你的团队喜欢战斗，或者玩家需要一个机会来练习使用他们的角色在获得等级后的新能力，就可以使用它。如果角色要穿越岛屿，而不是沿着海岸线前进，那么它就特别合适。",
	"A discordant sound—half a low growl, half a piercing screech—rips through the air. Abruptly, a hulking creature comes into view. A mix of purple feathers and deep brown fur covers its bearlike body, and its large eyes stare hungrily at you from its owlish head.": "一种不和谐的声音--一半是低沉的咆哮，一半是刺耳的尖叫--在空中荡漾。突然间，一个巨大的生物进入了人们的视野。紫色的羽毛和深棕色的皮毛混合在一起，覆盖在它熊一样的身体上，它的大眼睛从猫头鹰一样的脑袋上饥渴地盯着你。",
	"This encounter is a difficult challenge for 1st-level characters and can be scaled up for 2nd- or 3rd-level characters as noted below. It's appropriate whenever characters are traveling around the island by land.": "这个遭遇对1级人物来说是个困难的挑战，对2级或3级人物来说，可以按下面的比例提高。每当人物从陆地上绕岛旅行时，它都是合适的。",
	"A yipping sound erupts around you as angry kobolds emerge from their hiding places and attack!": "当愤怒的哥布林从他们的藏身处出现并发动攻击时，你的周围爆发出一阵阵的呵斥声!",
	"Their desperation means that they can easily be persuaded to stop fighting with an offer of money or food. Otherwise, they're not interested in conversation or negotiation.": "他们的绝望意味着，只要提供钱或食物，就能轻易说服他们停止战斗。否则，他们对谈话或谈判不感兴趣。",
	"If the characters are 2nd level, use six kobolds and two winged kobolds.": "如果角色是2级的，就用6个哥布林和2个带翅膀的哥布林。",
	"If the characters are 3rd level, use eight kobolds and three winged kobolds.": "如果角色是3级的，就用8个哥布林和3个带翅膀的哥布林。",
	"As described in the \"{@area Adventure Background|005|x}\" section in the introduction, Stormwreck Isle was formed from magic-fueled volcanic activity in the tomb of a monstrous red dragon named Sharruth. Some legends and rumors suggest Sharruth is not actually dead, merely imprisoned beneath the island, and the activity in Seagrow Caves suggests that all is not well beneath Stormwreck Isle.": "正如介绍中的\"{@area Adventure Background|005|x} \"部分所描述的，风暴残骸岛是由一个名叫沙鲁斯的畸形红龙的坟墓中的魔法激发的火山活动形成的。一些传说和传言表明，沙鲁斯其实并没有死，只是被囚禁在岛的下面，而海鸦洞的活动表明，风暴残骸岛下面的一切都不太妙。",
	"You can devise your own adventures around characters investigating Sharruth's tomb. Characters might scour the island until they find hidden vents they can use to access winding tunnels leading deep into the earth. More fume drakes and fire snakes might lurk below. Perhaps there's even a group of kobolds who serve mighty Sharruth.": "你可以围绕调查沙鲁斯墓的角色设计你自己的冒险。角色们可能会在岛上搜寻，直到找到隐藏的通风口，他们可以利用这些通风口进入通往地球深处的蜿蜒隧道。下面可能潜伏着更多的烟尘龙和火蛇。也许甚至还有一群服务于强大的沙鲁斯的哥布林。",
	"Such an adventure is yours to devise, and you can put your unique spin on what the characters do and discover there. Of course, if you're not ready to craft an expedition into the caverns beneath the island, then the characters simply don't discover those subterranean passages no matter how much they search.": "这样的冒险是由你来设计的，你可以对人物在那里的行为和发现做出你独特的解释。当然，如果你没有准备好对岛屿下面的洞穴进行探险，那么无论人物如何寻找，都不会发现那些地下通道。",
	"This chapter assumes the characters come here before going to the wreck of {@i Compass Rose}, and they are still 1st level. It also includes simple instructions to scale up the danger in combat encounters if the characters complete chapter 3, \"{@adventure Cursed Shipwreck|DoSI|3},\" before coming here, and are now 2nd level.": "本章假设人物在去{@i Compass Rose}的沉船前来到这里，而且他们仍然是第一级。它还包括简单的说明，如果人物在来这里之前完成了第三章\"{@adventure Cursed Shipwreck|DoSI|3}\"，并且现在是第二级，那么在战斗中遇到的危险就会加大。",
	"The sea caves on the southwest side of Stormwreck Isle are inhabited by an unusual colony of myconids—fungus people who normally live deep underground. Though they can't abide sunlight, these myconids used to welcome visitors now and then. In particular, they traded with Tarak from Dragon's Rest, giving him rare fungi that grow in their caves in exchange for food scraps and other waste from the cloister, which nourished the fungi in the caves. Recently, though, the myconids have rejected Tarak's visits and placed a monstrous guardian at the entrance to their caves that keeps all visitors away.": "风暴残骸岛西南侧的海洞里居住着一个不寻常的菌类群体--通常生活在地下深处的真菌。虽然他们不能忍受阳光，但这些菌类曾经时不时地欢迎访客。特别是，他们与来自龙之息的塔拉克进行交易，给他生长在他们洞穴中的稀有真菌，以换取食物残渣和其他来自回廊的废物，这些废物滋养了洞穴中的真菌。但最近，菌类拒绝了塔拉克的访问，并在他们洞穴的入口处放置了一个可怕的守护者，让所有的访客都无法进入。",
	"Besides this insidious poison, visitors to Seagrow Caves must face one additional threat: the stirges that nest in the caves. These blood-sucking monsters aren't much of a threat individually and don't bother the bloodless myconids, but they can be deadly in large numbers.": "除了这种阴险的毒药之外，海草洞的游客还必须面对一个额外的威胁：在洞穴中筑巢的海螺。这些吸血的怪物单个并没有什么威胁，也不会打扰到没有血的菌类，但它们数量多了就会致命。",
	"The caves have the following features:": "这些洞穴有以下特点。",
	"Unless noted otherwise, the ceilings in the caverns are 20 feet high, and the tunnels connecting the caverns are 15 feet high.": "除非另有说明，岩洞的天花板有20英尺高，而连接岩洞的隧道有15英尺高。",
	"The interior caves are illuminated by bioluminescent fungi, which provide dim light throughout the area. See \"{@book Vision|PHB|8|Vision and Light}\" in the {@book Basic Rules|PHB}.": "洞穴内部由生物发光的真菌照亮，为整个区域提供昏暗的光线。见\"{@book Vision|PHB|8|Vision and Light} \"中的{@book Basic Rules|PHB}。",
	"The cave walls are formed from hexagonal columns of dark gray basalt—volcanic rock originating from Sharruth's undersea tomb. The walls provide hand- and footholds, so climbing the walls doesn't require an ability check.": "洞壁是由深灰色玄武岩-火山岩的六边形柱子形成的，源自沙鲁斯的海底墓穴。墙壁提供了手和脚的支撑，所以爬墙不需要检查能力。",
	"Once the characters decide to visit Seagrow Caves, they have two options for reaching the site:": "一旦人物决定参观海龙洞，他们有两个选项可以到达该地点。",
	"If the characters arrive at Seagrow Caves at sea level, read the following text:": "如果人物在海平面上到达海龙洞，请阅读以下文字。",
	"A cliff of dark gray stone towers two hundred feet above the crashing waves, which rush in and out of a yawning cave mouth. A swirling slick of colors dances on the water's surface, emanating from the cave.": "一座深灰色石头的悬崖耸立在汹涌的海浪之上，海浪从一个巨大的洞口涌入又涌出。在水面上，有一种旋转的色彩在跳舞，从洞里发出。",
	"If the party approaches from above, read this text:": "如果党从上面接近，请阅读这段文字。",
	"An opening gapes in the cliff face two hundred feet below you, like a mouth drinking in the crashing waves. Two natural stairways formed of stone columns offer ways down the cliffs.": "在你脚下200英尺的悬崖面上有一个缺口，就像一张喝下海浪的嘴。两条由石柱形成的天然楼梯提供了走下悬崖的途径。",
	"The tides shift every 6 hours, as summarized on the Tides table.": "潮汐每6小时转变一次，正如潮汐表所总结的那样。",
	"Midnight to sunrise": "午夜至日出",
	"Sunrise to noon": "日出至中午",
	"Noon to sunset": "中午至日落",
	"Sunset to midnight": "日落至午夜",
	"The myconids' initial attitude toward outsiders is hostile (see \"{@book Social Interaction|PHB|8|Social Interaction}\" in the {@book Basic Rules|PHB}). They aren't malicious, though, and they don't resort to violence immediately. {@creature Myconid Adult||Adults} use their Rapport Spores to telepathically warn visitors to leave. (See \"Rapport Spores\" below for details about this form of communication.) {@creature Myconid Sprout||Sprouts} flee toward the nearest adults to warn them of intruders. If the characters attack, the myconids defend themselves.": "菌类对外来者的最初态度是敌对的（见{@book Basic Rules|PHB}中的\"{@book Social Interaction|PHB|8|Social Interaction}\"）。不过他们并不恶意，也不会立即诉诸暴力。{@creature Myconid Adult||Adults}使用他们的和睦孢子以心灵感应方式警告访客离开。(参见下面的 \"和睦孢子\"，了解这种交流方式的细节。) {@creature Myconid Sprout||Sprouts}逃向最近的成年人，警告他们有入侵者。如果角色攻击，菌类会自我防御。",
	"To convince a hostile myconid to converse or to allow the characters to do anything other than leave the caves, a character must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma check. Depending on the character's approach, the {@skill Deception}, {@skill Intimidation}, or {@skill Persuasion} skill can apply to the check. Mentioning Tarak's name or presenting the offering he sent the myconids grants advantage on this check.": "为了说服敌方菌类交谈或允许角色做任何事情，而不是离开洞穴，角色必须在DC20的魅力检查中取得成功。根据角色的方法，{@skill Deception}、{@skill Intimidation}或{@skill Persuasion}的技能可以适用于该检查。提及塔拉克的名字或出示他送给菌类的祭品，可以在这个检查中获得优势。",
	"An indifferent myconid is willing to explain what is going on in Seagrow Caves. The sprouts know only that their leader, {@creature Sinensa|DoSI}, has fallen ill—and that a nasty smell pervades their caves. Adult myconids know that the \"crystal cave\" ({@area area B6|06b|x}) is the source of the foul odor and that Sinensa fell ill after going into that cave to investigate the issue. The myconids normally avoid that cave because sunlight filters into it by way of the vent at the western end of the cave, and even diffuse sunlight is unpleasant to these cave-dwelling creatures.": "一个冷漠的霉菌愿意解释海草洞里发生的事情。芽胞们只知道他们的领袖{@creature Sinensa|DoSI}病倒了，而且他们的洞穴里弥漫着一股讨厌的气味。成年菌类知道 \"水晶洞\"（%%）是恶臭的源头，而辛恩萨是在进入那个洞穴调查问题后生病的。霉菌类通常会避开那个洞穴，因为阳光会通过洞穴西端的通风口进入洞穴，而即使是漫天的阳光也会让这些穴居生物感到不快。",
	"A myconid's Rapport Spores ability allows all intelligent creatures in the area to communicate telepathically with each other. The characters and the myconids are effectively speaking thoughts at each other. This effect doesn't allow any creature to probe invasively into another creature's mind. But it transcends language barriers, and you can play around with the kind of communication that the spores allow. Myconids' facial expressions might be difficult to read, but their telepathic communication might carry a direct expression of the myconids' emotional state. For example, when the myconids talk about their ailing leader, the characters might feel a deep sadness and a sense of anxiety much more clearly and powerfully than mere words and facial expressions can communicate.": "菌类的和睦孢子能力允许该地区的所有智能生物彼此进行心灵感应。角色和菌类实际上是在互相说想法。这个效果并不允许任何生物侵入另一个生物的心灵。但它超越了语言障碍，而且你可以玩弄孢子所允许的那种交流方式。霉菌的面部表情可能很难读懂，但它们的心灵感应可能带有霉菌的情绪状态的直接表达。例如，当菌类谈论他们生病的领袖时，人物可能会感受到一种深深的悲伤和焦虑感，这比单纯的语言和面部表情所能传达的要清楚和有力得多。",
	"The effect of Rapport Spores lasts for 1 hour, so characters might be telepathically linked to each other whenever they're within 30 feet of each other even after they leave the cave. Encourage the players to think about how this might affect their characters. Does it make them feel closer to their friends? Does it ease any suspicions they might have had about each other?": "和谐孢子的效果持续1小时，所以只要角色在30英尺范围内，即使他们离开了洞穴，也可能会彼此心灵感应。鼓励玩家思考这可能对他们的角色产生什么影响。这是否会使他们感到与朋友更亲近？这是否会减轻他们对彼此的怀疑？",
	"When myconids take damage, they release spores that alert all other myconids within 240 feet of them. All myconids in the cave are in range of each other's Distress Spores. Myconids in {@area areas B2|05b|x} and {@area B3|063|x} move to {@area area B4|066|x} if they detect Distress Spores.": "当菌类受到伤害时，它们会释放孢子，提醒周围240英尺内的所有其他菌类。洞穴中的所有菌类都在彼此的求救孢子的范围内。在{@area areas B2|05b|x}和{@area B3|063|x}的菌类如果探测到危难孢子，就会移动到{@area area B4|066|x}。",
	"The following locations are keyed to map 3, which shows the layout of the Seagrow Caves.": "以下地点与地图3相呼应，该地图显示了Seagrow洞穴的布局。",
	"Multicolored fungus covers the walls of this tunnel, its bioluminescent glow filling the cavern with dim light. The surface of the water swirls with colorful, faintly glowing spores—perhaps reacting to the movement of something under the surface.": "五颜六色的真菌覆盖了这条隧道的墙壁，其生物发光的光芒让洞穴充满了昏暗的光线。水面上旋转着五颜六色、微弱发光的孢子--也许是对水面下某物的运动产生了反应。",
	"As described on the previous page, the water level here varies by up to 10 feet with the tides. At high tide, the water is about 8 feet deep along the edges of the tunnel and 25 feet deep in the middle. At low tide, the walkways along the edges are exposed, and the water is 15 feet deep in the middle.": "正如上一页所描述的，这里的水位随着潮汐的变化而变化，最高可达10英尺。涨潮时，沿隧道边缘的水深约8英尺，中间的水深为25英尺。退潮时，沿边缘的人行道露出来，中间的水深为15英尺。",
	"This fifty-foot-high cavern is a forest of multicolored fungi, ranging from tiny filaments to tree-sized mushrooms. A natural staircase of stone columns along the east wall leads up ten feet to a higher cave area in the north. Water burbles down from that upper cave and collects in a large pool. Two small mushroom-like people are working amid the mushrooms near the pond. A sickening smell, like sulfur, hangs in the air.": "这个五十英尺高的洞穴是一片五彩缤纷的真菌森林，从细小的丝状物到树状物大小的蘑菇。沿着东墙有一个由石柱组成的天然楼梯，通向北部一个更高的洞穴区，有十英尺高。水从那个较高的洞穴中迸发下来，聚集在一个大水池中。两个像蘑菇一样的小人正在池塘边的蘑菇中工作。空气中弥漫着一股令人作呕的气味，像硫磺一样。",
	"The waterfall is fed from a pool in the upper cave, which in turn is supplied by runoff trickling down from the surface. Both pools are 5 feet deep at most.": "瀑布的水源来自于上层洞穴的一个水池，而这个水池的水源又来自于地表涓涓流下的径流。这两个池子最多只有5英尺深。",
	"The two mushroom people are {@creature Myconid Sprout||myconid sprouts} named Molen and Kraz. They are spreading fertilizer from {@area area B3|063|x}, while two {@creature Myconid Adult||myconid adults} named Hipsiz and Rugoso tend the mushrooms near the upper pool, out of sight from below. All four myconids are oblivious to the true threat in the cave—three {@creature Violet Fungus||violet fungi} that grow among the harmless mushrooms here.": "这两个蘑菇人是{@creature Myconid Sprout||myconid sprouts}叫Molen和Kraz。他们正在从{@area area B3|063|x}传播肥料，而两个名叫Hipsiz和Rugoso的{@creature Myconid Adult||myconid adults}则在上层水池附近照料蘑菇，从下面看不到。这四只菌类都对洞中的真正威胁视而不见--三只{@creature Violet Fungus||violet fungi}生长在这里的无害蘑菇中。",
	"If the characters move into the cave toward the myconids, one violet fungus attacks them, extending long tendrils that cause immediate rot when they touch living flesh. Read this text:": "如果人物进入洞穴走向菌类，有一种紫罗兰真菌就会攻击他们，伸出长长的卷须，一碰到活人的肉就会立即腐烂。阅读此文。",
	"As you advance into the cave, a sickly looking mushroom suddenly stirs to life. It extends long purple tendrils toward you and moves slowly across the cave floor on root-like tendrils.": "当你进入山洞时，一个看起来病怏怏的蘑菇突然活了过来。它向你伸出长长的紫色卷须，并以根状的卷须在洞穴地面上缓慢移动。",
	"Because the violet fungi move so slowly, it's easy for the characters to stay out of their reach and kill the fungus monsters with ranged attacks. The interesting part of this encounter is identifying the danger. One violet fungus moves and attacks to start the encounter, but the other two remain motionless until characters move close to them.": "由于紫罗兰真菌的移动速度很慢，角色们很容易在它们的范围之外，用远程攻击杀死真菌怪兽。这个遭遇战的有趣之处在于识别危险。一只紫罗兰真菌开始移动并攻击，但另外两只真菌一动不动，直到角色靠近它们。",
	"You don't need to keep track of exactly where everyone is standing in the room. Instead, rely on your sense of what's fun and exciting. When a character moves away from an active violet fungus, have another fungus stir and attack that character on the fungus's next turn. If a character scans the fungus farm looking for more violet fungi, cast as much doubt as you can: many of the fungi look sickly and purple but pose no danger.": "你不需要准确记录每个人在房间里的位置。相反，依靠你对什么是有趣和刺激的感觉。当一个角色远离一个活跃的紫罗兰真菌时，让另一个真菌搅动并在真菌的下一回合攻击该角色。如果一个角色在真菌农场里寻找更多的紫罗兰真菌，请尽可能多地提出疑问：许多真菌看起来是病态的、紫色的，但不构成危险。",
	"If the characters defeat the violet fungi, the myconids' attitude improves to indifferent, and they are willing to speak to the characters (using their Rapport Spores). The adults agree to accompany the characters and vouch for them with the rest of the myconid colony, improving the other myconids' attitude to indifferent as well.": "如果角色们打败了紫罗兰真菌，菌类的态度就会改善到无所谓，而且它们愿意和角色们说话（使用它们的和睦孢子）。成年人同意陪伴角色，并为他们与其他的霉菌群做担保，使其他霉菌的态度也改善为冷漠。",
	"A character who examines any of the fungi notices that many of the mushrooms are sickly, shriveled, and blotched with black patches of decay. The blight has no obvious source.": "检查任何一种真菌的人都会注意到，许多蘑菇都是病态的，干瘪的，并有黑色的腐烂斑点。这种病症没有明显的来源。",
	"This cave reeks of rot, and the floor is covered with decaying vegetation. Three small mushroom-folk are working amid the filth. In the southwest corner of the cave, a bulbous object the size of a cart clings to the wall and ceiling, glistening like a glob of jelly.": "这个洞穴散发着腐烂的气味，地上布满了腐烂的植物。三个小蘑菇人正在污秽的地方工作。在山洞的西南角，有一个推车大小的球状物体附着在墙壁和天花板上，像果冻球一样闪闪发光。",
	"If the characters are 2nd level, add two stirges to this encounter.": "如果角色是2级，则在这个遭遇中增加两个搅拌器。",
	"Six clusters of giant mushrooms are arranged in a rough circle around this cavern. Several human-sized mushroom folk stand in a circle in the center of the cave. The smell of sulfur is stronger here.": "六簇巨大的蘑菇在这个洞穴周围排列成一个粗略的圆圈。几个人形的蘑菇民工在洞穴中心站成一圈。这里的硫磺味更浓。",
	"All six myconids are ill and fatigued from the blight that is spreading through the caves, so they take turns resting here.": "所有六个霉菌都生病了，并因在洞穴中蔓延的枯萎病而疲惫不堪，所以它们轮流在这里休息。",
	"Glowing fungus and colorful crystals grow from the walls and ceilings of this smaller cave. In the middle of the cave, two human-sized mushroom folk tend to a larger specimen of their kind. The large one is shriveled and covered with unhealthy purple blotches, and it does not move.": "发光的真菌和五颜六色的水晶从这个较小的洞穴的墙壁和天花板上生长出来。在山洞的中间，两个人类大小的蘑菇民工在照看一个较大的同类标本。这个大的标本已经干瘪，上面布满了不健康的紫色斑点，而且它一动不动。",
	"Two {@creature Myconid Adult||myconid adults} named Auranta and Enok are tending the {@condition unconscious} myconid who leads this colony, {@creature Sinensa|DoSI}. The adults collect spores from a barrel-sized, glowing red fungus that vaguely resembles a human brain and puff the spores around the leader's head. The treatment is keeping the leader alive for now, but it is a losing battle. Sinensa's only hope is for the blight to end. The adults zealously defend their leader, immediately attacking intruders who aren't accompanied by other myconids.": "两个名叫奥兰塔和伊诺克的{@creature Myconid Adult||myconid adults}正在照看领导这个菌群的{@condition unconscious}菌类，{@creature Sinensa|DoSI}。成年人从一个木桶大小、发光的红色真菌中收集孢子，这个真菌依稀像人的大脑，并将孢子扑在领袖的头上。这种治疗方法目前还能让领袖活着，但这是一场失败的战斗。辛恩萨唯一的希望是让瘟疫结束。成年人狂热地保护他们的领袖，立即攻击没有其他菌类陪伴的入侵者。",
	"The air in this cave is choked with thick smoke that assaults your nostrils with a pungent odor of brimstone. Strange, flickering orange light illuminates the smoke. This area is free of fungal growth; instead, crystals grow from the rock. To your right, a large cluster of purple crystals juts from the stone. On the far wall, a glowing orange crystal wedged into a fissure in the cave wall seems to be the source of the light. Streaks of soot trace a path along the cave walls between the purple crystals and the fissure.": "这个洞穴里的空气被浓厚的烟雾所窒息，用硫磺的刺鼻气味袭击你的鼻孔。奇怪的、闪烁的橙色灯光照亮了这些烟雾。这个区域没有真菌生长；相反，岩石上长出了晶体。在你的右边，有一大簇紫色的晶体从石头上突出来。在远处的墙壁上，一块发光的橙色晶体夹在洞壁的裂缝中，似乎是光的来源。在紫色晶体和裂缝之间的洞壁上，有条烟灰的痕迹。",
	"This cave is the source of the blight spreading through the myconid colony. As the characters explore the cave, they can easily determine that noxious fumes from deep beneath the island seep up around the vein of purple crystals. Ordinarily, the fumes vent to the surface through a fissure in the west wall, but the fissure is now blocked by the enormous orange crystal, which is also the source of the light here.": "这个洞穴是疫病在菌类殖民地蔓延的源头。当角色们探索这个洞穴时，他们可以很容易地确定，来自岛屿地下深处的有毒气体在紫色晶体的静脉周围渗出。通常情况下，这些烟雾会通过西墙的裂缝排放到地面上，但现在裂缝被巨大的橙色水晶挡住了，这也是这里光线的来源。",
	"The heart of the problem is the tomb of the red dragon Sharruth, deep beneath the island. The presence of such a powerful dragon far underground causes the volcanic activity that produces the noxious fumes. What's more, the dragon's energy occasionally tears open small rifts in the fabric of reality that lead to the Elemental Plane of Fire—another dimension of reality that is the cosmic source of fiery energy. The Plane of Fire is the origin of both the orange crystal blocking the vent (which is actually an egg case) and the creatures currently in the cave.": "问题的核心是红龙沙鲁特的坟墓，在岛屿的深处。如此强大的龙在地下深处的存在导致了火山活动，产生了有毒的烟雾。更重要的是，龙的能量偶尔会撕开现实结构中的小裂缝，通往火元素位面--现实的另一个维度，是炽热能量的宇宙来源。火之界是堵住通风口的橙色水晶（实际上是一个蛋壳）和目前洞穴中的生物的起源。",
	"Breaking the fire crystal also reveals the reason the myconids avoid this cave: the cave is immediately filled with shimmering sunlight refracted through the crystals that line the vent. Bright light fills the entire area.": "打破火晶也揭示了菌类避开这个洞穴的原因：洞穴里立即充满了通过排在通风口的水晶折射出来的闪亮的阳光。明亮的光线充满了整个区域。",
	"The fire snake's egg breaks into 25 tiny chunks of obsidian worth 10 gp each.": "火蛇蛋碎成25块小黑曜石，每块价值10戈比。",
	"If the characters destroy the orange crystal so the toxic fumes can escape the caves, the myconids' attitude improves to friendly. Sinensa, the myconid leader, regains consciousness the following morning. If the characters are present when Sinensa awakens, Sinensa gives them the ruby morel from {@area area B5|068|x} and permission to keep any other treasure or mushrooms they collected in the caves.": "如果角色们摧毁了橙色晶体，使有毒气体能够逃离洞穴，霉菌的态度就会改善，变得友好。菌类的领袖Sinensa在第二天早上恢复了意识。如果人物在辛恩萨醒来时在场，辛恩萨会给他们{@area area B5|068|x}的红宝石羊肚菌，并允许他们保留在洞穴中收集的任何其他宝物或蘑菇。",
	"After they complete this chapter of the adventure, the characters gain a level. If they visited Seagrow Caves before the wreck of {@i Compass Rose}, they advance from 1st level to 2nd level. The residents of Dragon's Rest urge them to visit the wreck of {@i Compass Rose} next (see \"{@adventure Shipwreck|DoSI|3}\").": "在他们完成这一章的冒险后，人物获得了一个等级。如果他们在{@i Compass Rose}号沉船之前访问过Seagrow Caves，他们会从一级升到二级。Dragon's Rest的居民敦促他们接下来访问{@i Compass Rose}号沉船（见\"{@adventure Shipwreck|DoSI|3}\"）。",
	"If they've already explored the wreck of {@i Compass Rose} in {@area chapter 3|072|x}, they advance from 2nd level to 3rd level and are ready to visit Clifftop Observatory in {@adventure chapter 4|DoSI|4}. See \"{@area Lost Wyrmling|03b|x}.\"": "如果他们已经在{@area chapter 3|072|x}中探索了{@i Compass Rose}的残骸，他们就会从第二级升到第三级，并准备在{@adventure chapter 4|DoSI|4}中访问悬崖顶天文台。参见\"{@area Lost Wyrmling|03b|x}\"。",

	"Ever since the violent death of a gold dragon on the rocky shoal on the north side of Stormwreck Isle, the bone-strewn rocks have been the site of many shipwrecks through the centuries. One such shipwreck left a lasting mark on the island.": "自从一条金龙在风暴残骸岛北侧的岩石浅滩上暴毙后，几个世纪以来，这些布满白骨的岩石一直是许多沉船的所在地。其中一次沉船事故在岛上留下了持久的印记。",
	"Not long ago, a {@creature harpy} settled into the wreck of {@i Compass Rose}. With its magically entrancing voice, the harpy has been luring ships to crash on the shoal and feasting on the unlucky sailors. The sailors who escape the harpy's talons end up as zombies menacing the people of Dragon's Rest.": "不久前，一只{@creature harpy}在{@i Compass Rose}的沉船上定居。这只鹞子用它那神奇的声音，引诱船只在浅滩上坠落，并以倒霉的水手为食。逃过鹞鹰爪子的水手最后变成了僵尸，威胁着龙之谷的人们。",
	"This chapter assumes the characters heed Runara's advice and search {@i Compass Rose} for clues to the recent shipwrecks. If the characters decide to explore other recent wrecks, you can use the map of {@i Compass Rose} to represent any other sunken ship's deck plan, though most of the wrecks are entirely underwater. Characters exploring other wrecks might find more zombies—sailors killed in the wrecks who were animated by the talisman in {@i Compass Rose's} hold but couldn't get off their ships for some reason. They might also find giant octopuses (you can use the {@creature spore servant octopus|DoSI} stat block), {@creature Ghoul||ghouls}, or other dangers aboard. These adventures are yours to create, but only the wreck of {@i Compass Rose} holds the secret to freeing Dragon's Rest from the zombie attacks.": "本章假设人物听从Runara的建议，搜索{@i Compass Rose}近期沉船的线索。如果角色决定探索其他最近的沉船，你可以用{@i Compass Rose}的地图来代表任何其他沉船的甲板图，尽管大多数沉船都完全在水下。探索其他沉船的角色可能会发现更多的僵尸--在沉船中被杀死的水手，他们被{@i Compass Rose's}的护身符激活了，但由于某种原因无法下船。他们还可能发现巨大的章鱼（你可以使用{@creature spore servant octopus|DoSI}状态块），{@creature Ghoul||ghouls}，或其他船上的危险。这些冒险是由你来创造的，但只有{@i Compass Rose}的残骸拥有从僵尸攻击中解放龙之息的秘密。",
	"The wreck of {@i Compass Rose} is located at the northern end of a long spur of sharp rocks and dragon bones jutting from the ocean waves, about 2½ miles from the cloister. It remains mostly above the water, held up by the ancient bones that tore its hull. The wreck has the following features:": "{@i Compass Rose}的残骸位于距回廊约2.5英里的海浪中凸出的一长条尖石和龙骨的北端。它大部分仍在水面上，被撕裂船身的古老骨头托起。该沉船有以下特点。",

	"Stairs lead to upper decks at fore and aft, and doors lead into cabins under those decks. The mainmast remains intact and mostly upright, topped with a crow's nest overflowing with debris. A staircase near the mast and a large hatch on the port side both lead down into the hold.": "楼梯通向前后的上层甲板，而门则通向这些甲板下的舱室。主桅杆仍然完好无损，大部分是直立的，上面有一个溢出碎片的鸦巢。靠近桅杆的一个楼梯和左舷的一个大舱门都通向船舱。",

	"The door crashes open to reveal two drowned sailors in a cabin that must once have been luxurious. A bookcase, half collapsed, holds waterlogged and disintegrating books and scrolls. The polished wood desk leans awkwardly on three legs; it has an ornate compass set in its center. The bed is covered in rotting bedding and sags in the middle. A jagged hole gapes in the floor beside the bed.": "门被撞开，露出两个淹死的水手，他们在一个曾经很豪华的船舱里。一个半塌的书柜里放着积水和解体的书籍和卷轴。抛光的木质书桌笨拙地靠在三条腿上；它的中间镶嵌着一个华丽的指南针。床上铺着腐烂的被褥，中间下陷。床边的地板上有一个锯齿状的洞。",

You hear splashing as a walking corpse lumbers toward you, wading in water that doesn't quite reach its knees.": "下到下层甲板的过程是寒冷的、潮湿的、令人不安的。海水掩盖了地板，在船体上晃动。腐烂的板条箱和木桶散落在周围，有些自由漂浮，有些则堆积在角落里。当一具行尸走肉蹒跚地向你走来时，你听到了水花四溅的声音，它在水里游来游去，还没到膝盖。",
	"The {@creature zombie} is an obvious threat, but another Undead monster—a {@creature ghoul}—lurks in the aft part of the hold. Much more cunning than the zombies, the ghoul waits to attack until the characters are busy with the zombie. It hopes to paralyze a character with its Claw attack, then drag the {@condition paralyzed} character away to feast on while the other characters contend with the zombie. Unlike the zombies, the ghoul is not a former member of the ship's crew, but a vile scavenger drawn by the presence of decaying flesh.": "{@creature zombie}是一个明显的威胁，但另一个亡灵怪物--{@creature ghoul}--潜伏在船尾的部分。这只食尸鬼比僵尸要狡猾得多，它等待着攻击，直到角色们忙着对付僵尸的时候。它希望用爪子的攻击来麻痹一个角色，然后在其他角色对付僵尸的时候，把这个{@condition paralyzed}角色拖走大吃一顿。与僵尸不同，食尸鬼不是船上的前成员，而是被腐烂的肉体所吸引的卑鄙的清道夫。",
	"The water on the floor ranges from about 6 inches deep on the starboard (south) side of the ship to 18 inches deep on the port (north) side.

She told me love. Her husband waits for her at Dragon's Rest, having pledged his service to the dragon there. The talisman is made from locks of their hair, woven together as a promise to be reunited no matter what fate might befall them.

If necessary, you can have Runara warn the characters that they're not ready to face this part of the adventure yet.": "本章假设人物在探索了海格罗洞穴和{@i Compass Rose}的残骸后访问了天文台，因此已经达到了第三级。如果他们在参观其他冒险地点之前来到这里，那么战斗遭遇对他们来说可能太难了。这就是Runara在处理完岛上的其他问题后才会给人物月光石钥匙或关于天文台的信息的原因。如果有必要，你可以让Runara警告人物，他们还没有准备好面对冒险的这一部分。",
	"During its heyday, the Clifftop Observatory was a marvel of magical innovation. Adorned with gorgeous stained glass windows and marble spires, the observatory's towers stood high above the churning sea on separate islets, linked by shimmering bridges of magical energy.

	"About five days before the characters arrived on the island, a {@creature bronze dragon wyrmling} named Aidron left the safety of Dragon's Rest and Runara's tutelage and came to the ancient observatory. The two wyrmlings met and immediately clashed.

Ultimately, Sparkrender overpowered Aidron and imprisoned him in the observatory ruins.": "在人物到达岛上的大约五天前，一个名叫艾德隆的{@creature bronze dragon wyrmling}离开了安全的龙息和鲁纳拉的监护，来到了古老的天文台。两只巫妖相遇并立即发生了冲突。斯帕克雷德试图让青铜狼人反对鲁纳拉，但艾德隆对色龙的憎恨比他与鲁纳拉的分歧更强烈。最终，斯帕克雷德制服了艾德隆，并将他囚禁在天文台的废墟中。",
	"Sparkrender believes Aidron is the key to unlocking the observatory's magic and claiming his ancestor's power.

Consider having the wyrmling deliver short lines of dialogue on each of his turns, inspired by the following examples:": "尽管他很年轻，{@creature Blue Dragon Wyrmling||Sparkrender}是一个可怕的敌人和令人厌恶的恶棍。他在第一个回合使用呼吸武器，此后每回合都可以使用。(聪明的角色可以尝试利用雕像来掩护龙的呼吸；见{@book Basic Rules|PHB}中的\"{@book Cover|PHB|9|Cover}\"。可以考虑让暴龙在他的每个回合中发表简短的对话，灵感来自于以下例子。",
	"\"You pests will not stand in my way! I will claim the might of my ancestors!\"": "\"你们这些害虫不会阻挡我的道路！我将要求我的祖先的力量。我将要求我的祖先的力量！\"",
	"\"Get out of here before I tire of this game and end you all!\"": "\"在我厌倦这个游戏并结束你们所有人之前离开这里！\"",

	"\"Enough of this! This work is too important to be hindered by the likes of you!\"": "\"够了! 这项工作太重要了，不能被你们这些人阻碍！\"",
	"The dragon fights until reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, at which point he swears vengeance against the characters and attempts to flee the island starting on his next turn. (He might say something like this as he takes the {@action disengage||Disengage} action and flies away: \"I swear by Eldenemir the Raging Storm and the five heads of Tiamat, you will pay for this insult!\")": "这条龙一直战斗到命中率降到10或更低，这时他发誓要向这些角色复仇，并试图从下一个回合开始逃离这个岛。(他在采取{@action disengage||Disengage}行动并飞走时可能会说这样的话。\"我向愤怒的风暴艾尔德内米尔和提亚马特的五个头颅发誓，你们将为这种侮辱付出代价！\")",
	"If the characters flee, Sparkrender does not pursue them, but he taunts them as they run away. (He might say something like, \"Yes! Flee before my might, as all will flee when I claim my inheritance!\")": "如果人物逃跑，斯帕克雷德不会追赶他们，但他会在他们逃跑的时候嘲弄他们。(他可能会说：\"是的！在我的力量面前逃跑，就像我要求继承遗产时所有人都会逃跑一样！\")",
		"Each of the four statues can be rotated on its base. To unlock the hidden entrance to the observatory's secret archive, each statue must be rotated so it points at the constellation called the Dragon of Dawn on the floor's star map.": "四座雕像中的每一座都可以在其底座上进行旋转。要解开天文台秘密档案室的隐藏入口，必须旋转每个雕像，使其指向地板上的星图上称为 \"黎明之龙 \"的星座。",
	"If the characters found the clue in the isolated study ({@adventure area {@dice D4}|DoSI|4|D4: Isolated Study}) exhorting \"four scholars\" to \"point your eyes toward the Dragon's light,\" they might search the star map for a constellation that looks like a dragon. A character who searches the floor and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check finds a constellation resembling a dragon in the southeast quadrant of the floor.": "如果人物在孤立的书房（{@adventure area {@dice D4}|DoSI|4|D4: 孤立的书房}）中发现了劝告 \"四位学者\"\"将你的眼睛指向龙的光芒 \"的线索，他们可能会在星图上寻找一个看起来像龙的星座。一个在地板上搜索并成功通过DC10智力({@skill Investigation})检查的人物在地板的东南象限发现了一个类似龙的星座。",
	"Once each statue is in its correct position, a semicircular section at the center of the floor begins to glow before descending into the library ({@adventure area {@dice D6}|DoSI|4|D6: Secret Library}). It forms a spiral staircase leading down to the floor of the library. When any statue is rotated out of its position, the staircase rises back up, sealing the library shut once more. (A character on the staircase when this happens is lifted up to this area on the rising stairs.)": "一旦每个雕像都在正确的位置，地板中央的一个半圆形部分开始发光，然后下降到图书馆({@adventure area {@dice D6}|DoSI|4|D6: Secret Library})。它形成一个螺旋形的楼梯，通向图书馆的地板。当任何一个雕像被旋转出它的位置时，楼梯就会重新升起，将图书馆再次封闭。(当这种情况发生时，在楼梯上的人物会被提升到上升的楼梯上的这个区域）。",
	"This space was formerly a hidden archive of knowledge, accessible only to those who knew the observatory's secrets. However, the walls of the tower are crumbling—a fact that Sparkrender used to trap Aidron here. After weakening the bronze wyrmling, Sparkrender forced him into the library and then caused one of the walls to cave in, sealing the exit.": "这个空间以前是一个隐藏的知识档案，只有那些知道天文台秘密的人才能进入。然而，塔楼的墙壁已经摇摇欲坠了--这是斯帕克雷德用来困住艾德隆的事实。在削弱了青铜巫妖后，斯帕克雷德把他逼进了图书馆，然后使其中一面墙塌陷，封住了出口。",
	"Once they've cleared the rubble, the characters can access the library's interior.": "一旦他们清除了废墟，人物就可以进入图书馆的内部。",
	"Stale air heavy with the smell of old parchment floods your nostrils. The walls are lined with shelves stuffed full of old tomes and yellowing scrolls. Glass cases, toppled over and shattered, have strewn their contents across the stone floor. The sound of splintering wood echoes through the space, and a moment later you see an agitated bronze dragon the size of a bear, picking himself up from the wreckage of the old desk he apparently crashed into.": "浓重的陈旧羊皮纸气味的陈旧空气充斥着你的鼻孔。墙壁上的书架上塞满了旧书和发黄的卷轴。玻璃柜子被推倒后破碎，里面的东西散落在石头地板上。木头碎裂的声音在空间里回荡，片刻之后，你看到一条像熊一样大小的激动的青铜龙，从他显然是撞到的旧桌子的残骸中拾起自己。",
	"If the characters have not yet defeated Sparkrender, Aidron decides to face the blue dragon himself. He flies to the top of the observatory tower ({@adventure area {@dice D5}|DoSI|4|D5: Observatory Tower}) to confront Sparkrender once more. However, Aidron is too weak to defeat Sparkrender alone; he needs the characters' help.": "如果角色们还没有打败斯帕克雷德，艾德隆决定亲自面对这条蓝龙。他飞到瞭望塔的顶端（{@adventure area {@dice D5}|DoSI|4|D5: Observatory Tower}），再次与Sparkrender对峙。然而，艾德隆太弱了，他无法独自击败斯帕克雷德；他需要角色们的帮助。",
	"Once Sparkrender is defeated, the bronze wyrmling is excited to return to Dragon's Rest with the characters.": "一旦斯帕克雷德被打败，青铜巫妖就会兴奋地和人物一起回到龙之谷。",
	"This library was once a repository of magical knowledge and items of power, though most of its contents are too weathered to read. However, a character who searches through the room and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check finds a {@item +1 battleaxe} or a {@item Spell Scroll (2nd Level)||spell scroll} of {@spell hold person} ({@item +1 Weapon||+1 weapons} and {@item Spell Scroll||spell scrolls} are both described in {@adventure appendix A|DoSI|5}). A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals the location of both of these items without requiring an ability check. Aidron has also cataloged the contents of the room and can direct the characters to these valuable items.": "这个图书馆曾经是魔法知识和权力物品的储藏室，尽管它的大部分内容已经风化得无法阅读。然而，一个在房间里搜索并成功通过DC15智力（{@skill Investigation}）检查的角色可以找到一个{@item +1 battleaxe}或一个{@item Spell Scroll (2nd Level)||spell scroll}的{@spell hold person}（{@item +1 Weapon||+1 weapons}和{@item Spell Scroll||spell scrolls}都在{@adventure appendix A|DoSI|5}中描述）。一个{@spell detect magic}的咒语可以显示出这两种物品的位置，而不需要进行能力检查。艾德隆也对房间里的物品进行了编目，可以引导人物找到这些有价值的物品。",
	"Another possibility is that the characters drive Sparkrender away from the island without killing him, but leave Aidron imprisoned in {@adventure area {@dice D6}|DoSI|4|D6: Secret Library}. In this case, Runara urges the characters to return to the observatory to find Aidron. When they arrive, Sparkrender has also rested, healed, and returned to finish his work.": "另一种可能是，角色们把斯帕克雷德赶出了岛，但没有杀死他，而是把艾德隆囚禁在{@adventure area {@dice D6}|DoSI|4|D6: Secret Library}。在这种情况下，鲁纳拉敦促角色们回到天文台去找艾德隆。当他们到达时，斯帕克雷德也已经休息好了，痊愈了，并回来完成他的工作。",
	"In either case, the characters arrive just as Sparkrender's ritual is getting underway. (If they took or destroyed the dragon effigies in {@adventure area {@dice D2}|DoSI|4|D2: Rotunda Ruins}, they have been replaced by even cruder versions created in a hurry.) Read the following text:": "无论哪种情况，这些人物都是在斯帕克雷德的仪式即将开始时到达的。(如果他们在{@adventure area {@dice D2}|DoSI|4|D2: Rotunda Ruins}中拿走或毁掉了龙的雕像，那么它们已经被匆忙中制作的更粗糙的雕像所取代了）。阅读下面的文字。",
	"Streams of colored light swirl through the air around the golden statue in the ruined rotunda. Each shimmering display seems to originate from one of the five dragon effigies you saw before, and the lights' colors match the colors of the effigies: red, gold, brass, blue, and bronze. A blue dragon is perched atop the sculpture, throwing his head back in pain or ecstasy as the lights surround him, and he unleashes a bolt of lightning up toward the sky. At the base of the statue, a bronze dragon is bound to the ground by three heavy chains. He looks like he's in agony.": "彩色的光流在废墟圆形大厅的金色雕像周围的空气中旋转。每一个闪亮的显示似乎来自于你之前看到的五座龙像中的一座，灯光的颜色与龙像的颜色一致：红色、金色、黄铜色、蓝色和青铜色。一条蓝龙栖息在雕塑的顶端，当灯光围绕着他时，他痛苦或狂喜地甩着头，并向天空释放出一道闪电。在雕像的底部，一条青铜龙被三条沉重的锁链绑在地上。他看起来很痛苦的样子。",
	"To stop the ritual, the characters must face Sparkrender ({@creature blue dragon wyrmling}), potentially with the help of Aidron ({@creature bronze dragon wyrmling}), if they can free Aidron from his chains (see \"{@area Freeing Aidron|0c7|x}\" below). Any surviving kobolds and winged kobolds lurk here, but they stay out of combat if possible.": "为了阻止仪式，角色们必须面对Sparkrender（{@creature blue dragon wyrmling}），如果他们能把Aidron从锁链中解救出来（见下文\"{@area Freeing Aidron|0c7|x}\"），就有可能得到Aidron（{@creature bronze dragon wyrmling}）的帮助。任何幸存的哥布林和带翅膀的哥布林都潜伏在这里，但如果可能的话，他们不会参与战斗。",
	"See \"{@area Waking the Dragon|0bc|x}\" in {@adventure area {@dice D5}|DoSI|4|D5: Observatory Tower} for ideas on how to play Sparkrender in this encounter. He uses Breath Weapon as the characters approach the scene (unleashing lightning into the sky), so he has to wait for this action to recharge before he can use it on the characters this time. He fights to the death—he has too much riding on the success of this ritual to abandon it now.": "参见{@adventure area {@dice D5}|DoSI|4|D5: Observatory Tower}中的\"{@area Waking the Dragon|0bc|x}\"，了解如何在这场遭遇战中扮演Sparkrender。他在人物接近现场时使用了呼吸武器（向天空释放闪电），所以他必须等待这个动作充能，然后才能对这次的人物使用。他誓死奋战，这个仪式的成功与否对他的影响太大了，他现在不能放弃这个仪式。",
	"At the end of each round of combat (on initiative count 0, after everyone else has acted), a random magical effect occurs, caused by the magical lights that swirl around the rotunda. These lights are manifestations of the dragon spirits Sparkrender is trying to bind to himself, but their effects are unpredictable. Roll a {@dice d10} and consult the Dragon Spirits table to see what happens.": "在每一轮战斗结束时（主动权数为0，在其他人都行动后），会发生一个随机的魔法效果，由旋转在圆形大厅周围的魔法灯光引起。这些光是斯帕克雷德试图将龙魂束缚在自己身上的表现，但其效果是不可预测的。掷一个{@dice d10}，然后参考龙魂表，看看会发生什么。",

	"Large clasps attach the chains to iron rings embedded in the ground. A character can use an action to undo one clasp. Once all three clasps are undone, Aidron is no longer {@condition restrained}, though the chains reduce his speed by 10 feet.

	"The most straightforward way to prevent Sparkrender from completing his ritual and obtaining the power he craves is to kill him. But characters can also use their actions in combat to interfere with the process and hinder Sparkrender in magical ways. Let the players try whatever they can imagine, using these ideas as examples:": "阻止Sparkrender完成他的仪式并获得他所渴望的力量的最直接的方法是杀死他。但是角色们也可以利用他们在战斗中的行动来干扰这个过程，并以神奇的方式阻碍Sparkrender。让玩家以这些想法为例，尝试他们所能想象的一切。",
	"A character might use an action to lift an effigy closer to the central sculpture, breathe a prayer to the dragon it represents, or otherwise coax magic from it. Doing so immediately triggers the corresponding effect from the Dragon Spirits Table.": "一个角色可以用一个动作将一个雕像抬到离中央雕塑更近的地方，向它所代表的龙祈祷，或者用其他方式从它身上哄骗魔法。这样做会立即触发龙魂表中的相应效果。",
	"A character might break an effigy or throw it over the crumbling wall and into the ocean below. This ensures the corresponding effect does not occur again.

She welcomes them to stay at Dragon's Rest as long as they wish and furnishes them with whatever supplies they need for their travels when they're ready to leave the island.

They haven't had much success and are desperate, so they're hostile and fight to the death.": "四名 {@creature Kobold||kobolds} 和一名 {@creature winged kobold}（全部为秩序邪恶）参与了这次伏击。这些残忍、凶狠的龙人拒绝了 {@creature Runara|DoSI} 的和平教导，也不屈从于Sparkrender的暴政，他们把目标锁定在远离龙眠之地的旅行者身上。他们的成功并不多，如今已经走投无路，因此他们充满敌意，战斗到最后一刻。",
	"The sea caves on the southwest side of Stormwreck Isle are inhabited by an unusual colony of myconids—fungus people who normally live deep underground. Though they can't abide sunlight, these myconids used to welcome visitors now and then. In particular, they traded with {@creature Tarak|DoSI} from Dragon's Rest, giving him rare fungi that grow in their caves in exchange for food scraps and other waste from the cloister, which nourished the fungi in the caves. Recently, though, the myconids have rejected {@creature Tarak|DoSI}'s visits and placed a monstrous guardian at the entrance to their caves that keeps all visitors away.": "风暴沉船岛西南侧的海洞中栖息着一群不寻常的菌人——通常生活在地下深处的真菌生物。虽然它们无法忍受阳光，这些菌人过去偶尔会欢迎访客。特别是，它们与龙眠岛的{@creature Tarak|DoSI}进行交易，用它们海洞中生长的稀有真菌交换来自修道院的食物残渣和其他废物，以滋养海洞中的真菌。然而，最近，这些菌人拒绝了{@creature Tarak|DoSI}的访问，并在海洞入口处放置了一只巨大的守护者，阻止所有访客靠近。",
	"The reason for this sudden shift in the myconids' behavior is that a blight has spread through the caves and is poisoning the myconids, twisting their gardens, and even laying low their leader, {@creature Sinensa|DoSI}. The source of the blight is the tomb of the red dragon Sharruth deep beneath the island. Noxious fumes from the dragon's tomb normally filter up through the rock and vent to the surface through a cavern at the back of Seagrow Caves that the myconids avoid, but the vent has become blocked, and the fumes have spilled into the myconids' caves.": "这种蘑菇人行为突变的原因是一种疫病蔓延到了洞穴中，毒害了蘑菇人，扭曲了他们的花园，甚至让他们的领袖{@creature Sinensa|DoSI}倒下了。这种疫病的源头是位于岛屿深处的红龙夏鲁斯的墓穴。红龙墓穴中的有毒气体通常会通过岩石渗透并从Seagrow洞穴后面的一个洞穴通道排出到地表，蘑菇人会避开这个地方，但是这个通道已经被堵塞，有毒气体溢出到了蘑菇人的洞穴中。",
	"Toxic volcanic fumes from deep below the island are slowly poisoning the fungi in the caves. A faint smell of sulfur pervades the place, growing stronger the closer one gets to {@area area B6|06b|x}. If the characters take a long rest inside the caves before opening the vent in B6, each character must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become {@condition poisoned} (see \"{@book Conditions|PHB|12}\" in the {@book Basic Rules|PHB}). The {@spell lesser restoration} spell ends this effect, as does finishing a long rest in fresh air.": "岛下深处的有毒火山气体正在慢慢毒害洞穴中的真菌。硫磺的淡淡气味弥漫在这个地方，随着靠近{@area area B6|06b|x}而变得更加浓烈。如果角色在打开B6中的通风口之前在洞穴内休息很长时间，每个角色必须通过一次DC 13的体质豁免检定，否则会成为{@condition poisoned}(见“{@book Conditions|PHB|12}”在{@book Basic Rules|PHB}中)。{@spell lesser restoration}法术可以结束这种效应，或者在新鲜空气中完成一次长休也可以。",
	"Walking around the coast of the island is a little easier than rowing, even though it's farther because the characters have to walk around the bays instead of rowing across them. The 7-mile trip takes only 2 hours and 20 minutes at a normal walking pace. The characters can choose whether they want to walk on the cliffs high above the sea or pick their way among the tide pools at the base of the cliffs. The lower route is available only at low tide (see the {@adventure Tides table|DoSI|2|Entering the Caves}).": "在岛屿沿岸行走比划船要容易一些，尽管距离更远，因为角色们必须绕过海湾而不是划过它们。这段7英里的旅程只需要以正常步行速度花费2小时20分钟。角色们可以选择是在海面上方的悬崖上行走，还是在悬崖底部的潮池中穿行。较低的路线只在涨潮时可通行（见{@adventure Tides table|DoSI|2|Entering the Caves}）。",
	"At high tide, the 40-foot-high tunnel ({@area area B1|058|x}) is flooded all the way to {@area area B2|05b|x}. The natural stairways, which are not shown on the {@area map of Seagrow Caves|057|x}, descend the cliffs into the sea. The characters can either wait for low tide or row or swim into the tunnel. At low tide, a 5-foot-wide pathway is exposed along the base of the cliffs and the edge of the tunnel.": "在高潮时，这条40英尺高的隧道({@area area B1|058|x})一直淹没到{@area area B2|05b|x}。自然的楼梯，这些在{@area map of Seagrow Caves|057|x}上没有显示，沿着悬崖下降到海里。角色们可以选择等待低潮，或划船或游泳进入隧道。在低潮时，沿着悬崖底部和隧道边缘暴露出一条5英尺宽的路径。",
	"An indifferent myconid is willing to explain what is going on in Seagrow Caves. The sprouts know only that their leader, {@creature Sinensa|DoSI}, has fallen ill—and that a nasty smell pervades their caves. Adult myconids know that the \"crystal cave\" ({@area area B6|06b|x}) is the source of the foul odor and that {@creature Sinensa|DoSI} fell ill after going into that cave to investigate the issue. The myconids normally avoid that cave because sunlight filters into it by way of the vent at the western end of the cave, and even diffuse sunlight is unpleasant to these cave-dwelling creatures.": "一个冷漠的菌人愿意解释Seagrow洞穴中发生了什么。小菌芽们只知道他们的领袖，{@creature Sinensa|DoSI}，病倒了——而且洞穴里弥漫着一股难闻的气味。成年菌人知道“水晶洞”({@area area B6|06b|x})是这股恶臭的源头，而{@creature Sinensa|DoSI}在进入那个洞穴调查问题后生病了。菌人们通常避开那个洞穴，因为阳光通过洞穴西端的通风口进入，即使是弥散的阳光对这些居住在洞穴中的生物也是令人不快的。",
	"At high tide, the tunnel is flooded, so visitors must approach by boat or swim. At low tide, walkways formed by the tops of stone columns line the sides of the tunnel, leading to a flight of natural steps up to {@area area B2|05b|x}. A {@creature spore servant octopus|DoSI} lurks in the water and attacks any creatures (other than myconids) who enter the tunnel, regardless of the state of the tides. Before the myconid leader lapsed into unconsciousness, it created this guardian to keep outsiders away.": "在高潮时，隧道被淹没，因此游客必须乘船或游泳接近。在低潮时，由石柱顶部形成的人行道沿着隧道两侧，通往一段自然阶梯，直至{@area area B2|05b|x}。一只{@creature spore servant octopus|DoSI}潜伏在水中，攻击进入隧道的任何生物（除了粘菌人），无论潮汐状况如何。在粘菌人领袖陷入昏迷之前，它创造了这个守护者来阻止外来者。",

	"Because the violet fungi move so slowly, it's easy for the characters to stay out of their reach and kill the fungus monsters with ranged attacks. The interesting part of this encounter is identifying the danger. One {@creature violet fungus|DoSI} moves and attacks to start the encounter, but the other two remain motionless until characters move close to them.": "由于紫色菌类移动缓慢，角色很容易保持距离，用远程攻击杀死真菌怪物。这次遭遇的有趣之处在于识别危险。一个{@creature violet fungus|DoSI}移动并发动攻击开始遭遇，但另外两个保持静止，直到角色靠近它们。",
	"You don't need to keep track of exactly where everyone is standing in the room. Instead, rely on your sense of what's fun and exciting.

If a character scans the fungus farm looking for more violet fungi, cast as much doubt as you can: many of the fungi look sickly and purple but pose no danger.": "你不需要准确地记住每个人在房间里站的位置。相反，依靠你对什么是有趣和令人兴奋的感觉。当一个角色远离一个活跃的{@creature violet fungus|DoSI}时，让另一个真菌在接下来的回合中激动并攻击那个角色。如果一个角色扫描真菌农场寻找更多紫色真菌，尽可能地产生怀疑：许多真菌看起来病态且紫色，但并不构成危险。",

	"Destroying the orange crystal blocking the western fissure allows the noxious fumes to escape the cave and stops the blight that is harming the myconids. A single strong whack with a weapon, a crowbar, or another tool is sufficient to shatter it.

A waterproof leather case holds a blue silk fan painted with powdered blue gems, worth 25 gp. There are also a few ordinary items Sparkrender enjoyed, including a crude flute with a pleasing sound, an hourglass filled with sparkling sand, and a set of seven candlesticks.": "随着Sparkrender（火花渲染）不再保卫他的新生财宝，角色们可以将其收集起来。其中包括大量的硬币：4,500 cp（铜币），2,200 sp（银币）和130 gp（金币）。还有十颗宝石：五颗苍白{@item blue quartz}的水晶，每颗价值10 gp，以及五颗蓝色{@item jasper}的石头，每颗价值50 gp。一个防水的皮革盒子里装着一把蓝色丝绸扇子，上面绘有蓝宝石粉，价值25 gp。还有一些Sparkrender喜欢的普通物品，包括一支发出悦耳声音的粗制长笛，一个装满闪闪发光沙子的沙漏，和一套七只烛台。",
	"If the characters don't use the hidden entrance in area {@dice D5}, they can attempt to clear away the rubble from the cave-in to access the secret library. To access the rubble, the characters must climb down from area {@dice D5} or swim to the bottom of this spire and climb up from the water. Clearing the rubble takes one character 30 minutes, or the characters can work together to clear it faster (for example, it takes two characters 15 minutes or five characters 6 minutes). If the characters are trying to clear the rubble quietly, it takes twice as long, and at least half of the characters must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check to avoid waking Sparkrender.": "如果角色们不使用区域{@dice D5}的隐藏入口，他们可以尝试清除掉塌方的瓦砾，以便进入秘密图书馆。要清除瓦砾，角色们必须从区域{@dice D5}爬下去，或者游到这座尖塔的底部，然后从水中爬上来。清除瓦砾需要一个角色30分钟，或者角色们可以一起合作更快地清理（例如，两个角色15分钟，五个角色6分钟）。如果角色们试图悄悄地清除瓦砾，那么需要花费两倍的时间，至少一半的角色必须在一次DC 14的敏捷检定中成功，以避免惊醒闪炎者（Sparkrender）。",
	"Aidron the {@creature bronze dragon wyrmling} excitedly greets the characters when they enter. He has spent days trying to dig his way out through the caved-in wall, but his efforts from the inside only caused further collapse. He is eager to escape, but if the characters ask, he explains his conflict with Sparkrender. He expresses regret over his inability to defeat the blue wyrmling and concern for the safety of the island's other inhabitants. And he is terrified of the fate Sparkrender has in store for him—the blue dragon plans to use Aidron's death to claim the power of all the dead dragons on the island, transforming himself into a mighty draconic avatar.": "{@creature bronze dragon wyrmling}激动地向角色们打招呼。他已经花了几天时间试图从塌陷的墙壁中挖出来，但他从内部的努力只导致了进一步的坍塌。他渴望逃脱，但如果角色们询问，他会解释他与Sparkrender的冲突。他对无法击败蓝色幼龙感到遗憾，并担心岛上其他居民的安全。他对Sparkrender为他准备的命运感到恐惧——蓝龙计划利用Aidron的死亡来获得岛上所有死龙的力量，将自己转变为强大的龙化化身。",
	"If the characters leave the observatory without defeating {@creature Blue Dragon Wyrmling||Sparkrender}, they might return to find the blue wyrmling's ritual underway. This is most likely to happen if the characters leave and take a long rest before confronting Sparkrender, or if they flee from combat with Sparkrender and return after they've rested.": "如果角色在没有击败{@creature Blue Dragon Wyrmling||Sparkrender}的情况下离开观测站，他们可能会回来发现蓝色幼龙的仪式正在进行中。如果角色在与闪电炉战斗之前离开并休息很长时间，或者在与闪电炉战斗后逃跑并在休息后返回，这种情况最有可能发生。",
	"Turadaer's Tricks. Aidron and the characters gain {@book advantage|PHB|7|Advantage and Disadvantage} on attack rolls and saving throws until initiative count 0 of the next round, as the brass light shimmers and sparks around them.": "图拉达尔的诡计。艾德隆(Aidron)和角色们在接下来的回合直到倒数计时为0时，攻击投掷和豁免投掷获得{@book advantage|PHB|7|Advantage and Disadvantage}加值，当黄铜光芒在他们周围闪烁迸发。",
	"Aidron is bound by three heavy chains that keep him {@condition restrained}. He can still take actions, such as biting or clawing an enemy that comes within his reach, but he knows Sparkrender is unaffected by his lightning Breath Weapon, so he doesn't bother using it. He might use his Repulsion Breath if he can see a good use for it.": "艾德隆被三根沉重的链条束缚着，使他无法移动{@condition restrained}。他仍然可以采取行动，比如咬或抓住靠近他的敌人，但他知道“闪火”（Sparkrender）对他的闪电吐息无效，所以他不会费心使用它。如果他能看到合适的时机，他可能会使用他的排斥吐息。",
	"Characters might try to manipulate the golden sculpture as a way of disrupting the ritual. The sculpture is large and sturdy, though, so a single action has no noticeable effect on the sculpture or the magic. (The sculpture has AC 20, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.) However, disturbing the sculpture does distract Sparkrender. The first time a character uses an action to attack or otherwise try to disturb the sculpture, the distracted blue dragon has {@book disadvantage|PHB|7|Advantage and Disadvantage} on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of his next turn. Once he sees the character's meddling isn't very effective, he can't be distracted in this way again.": "角色可能会尝试操纵黄金雕塑来干扰仪式。然而，这座雕塑又大又坚固，所以单个动作对雕塑或魔法没有明显影响。 (雕塑的AC为20，27点生命值，并且免疫毒素和精神伤害。) 但是，打扰雕塑会分散Sparkrender的注意力。当角色第一次使用动作攻击或试图干扰雕塑时，这只分心的蓝龙在他的下一个回合结束前攻击检定和豁免检定投掷时有{@book disadvantage|PHB|7|Advantage and Disadvantage}。一旦他发现角色的干预并不是很有效，他就不会再被这种方式分散注意力。",
	"A creature can squeeze through a space large enough for a creature one size smaller than itself. When a creature is squeezing through such a space, its speed is halved, it has {@book disadvantage|PHB|7|Advantage and Disadvantage} on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls against it have {@book advantage|PHB|7|Advantage and Disadvantage}.": "一只生物可以挤过一个足够容纳比自己小一号大小的生物的空间。当一只生物挤过这样的空间时，它的速度减半，攻击投掷和敏捷豁免投掷上有{@book disadvantage|PHB|7|Advantage and Disadvantage}，对它的攻击投掷有{@book advantage|PHB|7|Advantage and Disadvantage}。",
	"Saving throws in a stat block are shown with the total modifier—the creature's ability modifier plus its proficiency bonus. If a creature's stat block says \"Con +4,\" roll a {@dice d20} and add 4 when the creature makes a saving throw using Constitution.": "在属性块中，豁免投掷会显示总修正值——生物的属性修正值加上其熟练加值。如果一个生物的属性块上写着“体质 +4”，那么当这个生物使用体质进行豁免投掷时，掷出一个{@dice d20}，然后再加上4。",
	"The Senses entry gives a creature's passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score, as well as any special senses the creature has, such as the following:": "感知（{@skill Perception}）分数，以及生物具有的任何特殊感官，例如以下内容。",
	"Any damage or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described here. As the DM, you can use the average damage or roll the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented. For example, if a monster deals 4 ({@dice 1d8}) slashing damage with its longsword, that notation means you can have the monster deal 4 damage, or you can roll {@dice 1d8} to determine the damage.": "攻击命中目标造成的任何伤害或其他效果在这里描述。作为DM，你可以使用平均伤害或掷骰确定伤害；因此，平均伤害和骰子表达式都会被呈现。例如，如果一个怪物用它的长剑造成4({@dice 1d8})点割伤伤害，这个标记意味着你可以让怪物造成4点伤害，或者你可以掷骰{@dice 1d8}来确定伤害。",
	"{@b Recharge X–Y}. The notation \"Recharge X–Y\" means a creature can use a special ability once, and then the ability has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the creature's turns, roll a {@dice d6}. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the creature regains the use of that special ability. The ability also recharges when the creature finishes a short or long rest. For example, \"Recharge 5–6\" means a creature can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the creature's turn each round, it regains the use of the ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a {@dice d6}.": "{@b Recharge X–Y}。\"重置 X–Y\" 的标记意味着生物可以使用一次特殊能力，然后在每一轮战斗中有随机机会重置该能力。在生物的每个回合开始时，投掷一个{@dice d6}。如果投掷结果是重置标记中的一个数字，生物就会恢复使用该特殊能力。该能力还会在生物完成短暂休息或长休息时重置。例如，\"重置 5–6\" 意味着生物可以使用该特殊能力一次。然后，在每一轮生物的回合开始时，如果在{@dice d6}上掷出5或6，它就会恢复使用该能力。",
