	"The Forgotten Realms is a world of high fantasy, populated by elves, dwarves, halflings, humans, and other folk—one of many such worlds in the vast multiverse of the D&D game. In the Realms, fighters dare the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate.

	"The roads and rivers of the Realms carry minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers and sailors. Bold adventurers follow tales of strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can take even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world, but these paths are never safe. Travelers in the Realms face fell magic and deadly monsters. Even farms and freeholds a day's walk from a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the wrath of a dragon.": "在王国的道路和河流上，吟游诗人和小贩、商人和卫兵、士兵和水手都在这里。大胆的冒险家们追寻着奇怪的、光荣的、遥远的地方的故事。好的地图和清晰的路径甚至可以把一个没有经验的年轻人带向世界的远方，但这些道路从来都不安全。境界中的旅行者面临着堕落的魔法和致命的怪物。即使是离城市只有一天路程的农场和土地，也可能成为怪物的猎物，没有一个地方能免遭龙的愤怒。",
	"This adventure takes place on Stormwreck Isle, a small island in a region called the Sword Coast. This region is a place of adventure, where daring souls delve into ancient strongholds and explore the ruins of long-lost kingdoms.

	"If you have fewer than four players, you can have some players take on the role of two characters so the group has at least four characters.

	"According to legend, two families of dragons came into being in the very first days of the world's creation. Bahamut, the noble Platinum Dragon, made the metallic dragons—gold, silver, bronze, brass, and copper. Cruel, five-headed Tiamat made the chromatic dragons—red, blue, green, black and white. The metallic and chromatic dragons share a mutual animosity that originates in the enmity between Bahamut and Tiamat (Bahamut is often called the King of Metallic Dragons in the world of the Forgotten Realms, and Tiamat the Queen of Chromatic Dragons. In other worlds they have different names, and like all gods, they are beyond gender.)": "根据传说，在世界诞生的最初几天，有两个龙家族诞生了。巴哈姆特，高贵的白金龙，制造了金属龙--金、银、铜、黄铜和铜。残忍的五头龙提亚马特制造了彩色的龙--红色、蓝色、绿色、黑色和白色。金属龙和彩色龙有一种共同的敌意，这种敌意源于巴哈姆特和提亚马特之间的仇恨（巴哈姆特在《被遗忘的世界》中通常被称为金属龙之王，而提亚马特是彩色龙的女王。在其他世界中，他们有不同的名字，而且像所有的神一样，他们是超越性别的。）",
	"The origin of Dragon's Rest is rooted in that animosity. Ages ago, a fire-breathing red dragon called Sharruth rampaged up and down the Sword Coast. Three metallic dragons joined forces to battle Sharruth and imprisoned her beneath the ocean floor, believing seawater would quench her fire and keep her bound forever. But Sharruth's fury, legend says, caused the undersea volcanic activity that formed Stormwreck Isle.": "龙之息的起源就源于这种敌意。几百年前，一条名叫沙鲁斯的喷火红龙在剑海岸上下肆虐。三条金属龙联合起来与沙鲁斯战斗，并将她囚禁在海底，相信海水可以熄灭她的火，让她永远被束缚。但传说中，沙鲁斯的怒火引起了海底火山活动，形成了风暴残骸岛。",
	"In all likelihood, Sharruth is long dead and entombed beneath the island, but chromatic dragons whisper that she still lives and will one day emerge from her prison. One fact is undeniable: the powerful magic embodied in such an ancient dragon has left a permanent mark on Stormwreck Isle. That magic has drawn other dragons to the island throughout the centuries, making it a recurring battlefield in the conflict between chromatic and metallic dragons. Several of these dragons have died there, each leaving behind a spiritual scar that causes unpredictable magical effects.": "在所有的可能性中，沙鲁斯早就死了，被埋在岛的下面，但半透明的龙低声说，她仍然活着，并且有一天会从她的监狱里出来。有一个事实是不可否认的：这样一条古老的龙所体现的强大魔法在风暴残骸岛上留下了永久的印记。几个世纪以来，这种魔法将其他龙吸引到岛上，使它成为色龙和金属龙之间冲突的一个反复的战场。其中有几条龙死在了那里，每条龙都留下了精神上的伤痕，造成了不可预知的魔法效果。",
	"Runara has grown weary of strife, and Stormwreck Isle's wounds are a constant reminder to her of the cost of such conflict. Devoting herself to peace and reconciliation, she established the cloister of Dragon's Rest as a safe haven from violence. Living in human guise, Runara now serves as the leader of a tiny group of hermits and ascetics.": "鲁纳拉已经厌倦了纷争，风暴残骸岛的伤痕不断提醒她这种冲突的代价。她致力于和平与和解，建立了 \"龙息 \"修道院，作为一个远离暴力的安全港。茹娜拉现在以人类的身份生活，担任一小批隐士和苦行者的领袖。",

	"In {@i Dragons of Stormwreck Isle}, the characters experience the magical scars left behind by the death of dragons.

	"You can give players a sense of how well they're doing against a creature by describing, in narrative terms, how hurt the creature is. For example, if the creature has fewer than half its hit points remaining, you can describe it as being badly wounded.

	"As they fight a creature, characters should learn more about the creature's abilities. Share information with the players as it becomes apparent. For example, if the wizard casts {@spell flaming sphere} (a spell that deals fire damage) against a {@creature fire snake} (a creature that's immune to fire damage), let the wizard's player know the spell doesn't seem to bother the creature at all. Players might correctly guess that a fire snake probably isn't harmed by fire; feel free to subtly confirm their guesses (perhaps smiling and saying, \"That sounds reasonable\").": "在与生物战斗的过程中，角色应该了解更多关于生物的能力。当信息变得明显时，与玩家分享。例如，如果巫师对{@creature fire snake}（对火伤害免疫的生物）施展{@spell flaming sphere}（造成火伤害的法术），让巫师的玩家知道这个法术似乎根本就没有影响到这个生物。玩家可能会正确地猜测火蛇可能不会受到火的伤害；可以巧妙地确认他们的猜测（也许可以微笑着说，\"这听起来很合理\"）。",

While the characters travel between locations on the island, or if they set out to explore the island, they might stumble across fantastical creatures and locations that provide an extra challenge on their journey.": "这次冒险详细介绍了龙的休息和三个冒险地点，但风暴残骸岛在这些地点之外还有可能出现刺激和危险。当人物在岛上的各个地点之间旅行时，或者如果他们开始探索这个岛，他们可能会偶然发现奇异的生物和地点，为他们的旅程提供额外的挑战。",
	"Place these encounters wherever you want to on the island, or use them as inspiration as you begin to craft your own adventures.": "在岛上任何你想去的地方放置这些奇遇，或者在你开始制作自己的冒险时使用它们作为灵感。",
	"This encounter poses a simple challenge for characters of 2nd level or higher, or a harder challenge for 1st-level characters. It's particularly appropriate if the characters are rowing around the island or making their way along the coast at sea level.": "这个遭遇对2级以上的角色来说是一个简单的挑战，对1级的角色来说则是更难的挑战。如果角色在岛上划船或在海平面上沿着海岸线前进，就特别合适。",
	"Billowing clouds of steam emerge from the rocks ahead, and the air grows thicker with moisture. As you round a bend, you see a cove where a hot spring burbles up from the rocks and spills into a pool before draining into the ocean. The turquoise water is luminescent, and the gray basalt edges of the spring are lined with vibrantly colored mushrooms, which occasionally burst in a shower of rainbow spores.": "前面的岩石上冒出滚滚的蒸汽云，空气中的水分越来越浓。当你转过一个弯时，你看到一个海湾，那里的温泉从岩石中喷涌而出，在排入海洋之前溢出一个水池。绿松石的水是发光的，泉水的灰色玄武岩边缘有许多颜色鲜艳的蘑菇，它们偶尔会在彩虹孢子雨中迸发出来。",
	"The spring is the site of a brass dragon's death, and life-giving magic persists at the site. A character who spends 10 minutes bathing in the waters of the spring can roll one of their Hit Dice (noted on each character sheet) and regain hit points equal to the roll plus their Constitution modifier. A character can benefit from bathing in the hot spring at most once per day.": "该泉水是一条铜龙的死亡之地，而赋予生命的魔法在该处持续存在。在温泉中浸泡10分钟的人物可以掷出他们的一个命中率骰子（在每个人物表上注明），并恢复相当于该骰子加上他们的体质修正值的命中率。一个角色每天最多可以从温泉沐浴中获益一次。",
	"This encounter poses a medium challenge for 3rd-level characters and a difficult challenge for 2nd-level characters. Use it if your group enjoys combat or the players need a chance to practice using their characters' new abilities after gaining a level. It's particularly appropriate if the characters are traveling across the island rather than following the coast.": "这个遭遇对3级的角色来说是一个中等的挑战，对2级的角色来说是一个困难的挑战。如果你的团队喜欢战斗，或者玩家需要一个机会来练习使用他们的角色在获得等级后的新能力，就可以使用它。如果角色要穿越岛屿，而不是沿着海岸线前进，那么它就特别合适。",
	"A discordant sound—half a low growl, half a piercing screech—rips through the air. Abruptly, a hulking creature comes into view. A mix of purple feathers and deep brown fur covers its bearlike body, and its large eyes stare hungrily at you from its owlish head.": "一种不和谐的声音--一半是低沉的咆哮，一半是刺耳的尖叫--在空中荡漾。突然间，一个巨大的生物进入了人们的视野。紫色的羽毛和深棕色的皮毛混合在一起，覆盖在它熊一样的身体上，它的大眼睛从猫头鹰一样的脑袋上饥渴地盯着你。",
	"This encounter is a difficult challenge for 1st-level characters and can be scaled up for 2nd- or 3rd-level characters as noted below. It's appropriate whenever characters are traveling around the island by land.": "这个遭遇对1级人物来说是个困难的挑战，对2级或3级人物来说，可以按下面的比例提高。每当人物从陆地上绕岛旅行时，它都是合适的。",
	"A yipping sound erupts around you as angry kobolds emerge from their hiding places and attack!": "当愤怒的哥布林从他们的藏身处出现并发动攻击时，你的周围爆发出一阵阵的呵斥声!",
	"Their desperation means that they can easily be persuaded to stop fighting with an offer of money or food. Otherwise, they're not interested in conversation or negotiation.": "他们的绝望意味着，只要提供钱或食物，就能轻易说服他们停止战斗。否则，他们对谈话或谈判不感兴趣。",
	"If the characters are 2nd level, use six kobolds and two winged kobolds.": "如果角色是2级的，就用6个哥布林和2个带翅膀的哥布林。",
	"If the characters are 3rd level, use eight kobolds and three winged kobolds.": "如果角色是3级的，就用8个哥布林和3个带翅膀的哥布林。",
	"As described in the \"{@area Adventure Background|005|x}\" section in the introduction, Stormwreck Isle was formed from magic-fueled volcanic activity in the tomb of a monstrous red dragon named Sharruth. Some legends and rumors suggest Sharruth is not actually dead, merely imprisoned beneath the island, and the activity in Seagrow Caves suggests that all is not well beneath Stormwreck Isle.": "正如介绍中的\"{@area Adventure Background|005|x} \"部分所描述的，风暴残骸岛是由一个名叫沙鲁斯的畸形红龙的坟墓中的魔法激发的火山活动形成的。一些传说和传言表明，沙鲁斯其实并没有死，只是被囚禁在岛的下面，而海鸦洞的活动表明，风暴残骸岛下面的一切都不太妙。",
	"You can devise your own adventures around characters investigating Sharruth's tomb. Characters might scour the island until they find hidden vents they can use to access winding tunnels leading deep into the earth. More fume drakes and fire snakes might lurk below. Perhaps there's even a group of kobolds who serve mighty Sharruth.": "你可以围绕调查沙鲁斯墓的角色设计你自己的冒险。角色们可能会在岛上搜寻，直到找到隐藏的通风口，他们可以利用这些通风口进入通往地球深处的蜿蜒隧道。下面可能潜伏着更多的烟尘龙和火蛇。也许甚至还有一群服务于强大的沙鲁斯的哥布林。",
	"Such an adventure is yours to devise, and you can put your unique spin on what the characters do and discover there. Of course, if you're not ready to craft an expedition into the caverns beneath the island, then the characters simply don't discover those subterranean passages no matter how much they search.": "这样的冒险是由你来设计的，你可以对人物在那里的行为和发现做出你独特的解释。当然，如果你没有准备好对岛屿下面的洞穴进行探险，那么无论人物如何寻找，都不会发现那些地下通道。",
	"This chapter assumes the characters come here before going to the wreck of {@i Compass Rose}, and they are still 1st level. It also includes simple instructions to scale up the danger in combat encounters if the characters complete chapter 3, \"{@adventure Cursed Shipwreck|DoSI|3},\" before coming here, and are now 2nd level.": "本章假设人物在去{@i Compass Rose}的沉船前来到这里，而且他们仍然是第一级。它还包括简单的说明，如果人物在来这里之前完成了第三章\"{@adventure Cursed Shipwreck|DoSI|3}\"，并且现在是第二级，那么在战斗中遇到的危险就会加大。",
	"The sea caves on the southwest side of Stormwreck Isle are inhabited by an unusual colony of myconids—fungus people who normally live deep underground. Though they can't abide sunlight, these myconids used to welcome visitors now and then. In particular, they traded with Tarak from Dragon's Rest, giving him rare fungi that grow in their caves in exchange for food scraps and other waste from the cloister, which nourished the fungi in the caves. Recently, though, the myconids have rejected Tarak's visits and placed a monstrous guardian at the entrance to their caves that keeps all visitors away.": "风暴残骸岛西南侧的海洞里居住着一个不寻常的菌类群体--通常生活在地下深处的真菌。虽然他们不能忍受阳光，但这些菌类曾经时不时地欢迎访客。特别是，他们与来自龙之息的塔拉克进行交易，给他生长在他们洞穴中的稀有真菌，以换取食物残渣和其他来自回廊的废物，这些废物滋养了洞穴中的真菌。但最近，菌类拒绝了塔拉克的访问，并在他们洞穴的入口处放置了一个可怕的守护者，让所有的访客都无法进入。",
	"Besides this insidious poison, visitors to Seagrow Caves must face one additional threat: the stirges that nest in the caves. These blood-sucking monsters aren't much of a threat individually and don't bother the bloodless myconids, but they can be deadly in large numbers.": "除了这种阴险的毒药之外，海草洞的游客还必须面对一个额外的威胁：在洞穴中筑巢的海螺。这些吸血的怪物单个并没有什么威胁，也不会打扰到没有血的菌类，但它们数量多了就会致命。",
	"The caves have the following features:": "这些洞穴有以下特点。",
	"Unless noted otherwise, the ceilings in the caverns are 20 feet high, and the tunnels connecting the caverns are 15 feet high.": "除非另有说明，岩洞的天花板有20英尺高，而连接岩洞的隧道有15英尺高。",

	"The cave walls are formed from hexagonal columns of dark gray basalt—volcanic rock originating from Sharruth's undersea tomb. The walls provide hand- and footholds, so climbing the walls doesn't require an ability check.": "洞壁是由深灰色玄武岩-火山岩的六边形柱子形成的，源自沙鲁斯的海底墓穴。墙壁提供了手和脚的支撑，所以爬墙不需要检查能力。",
	"Once the characters decide to visit Seagrow Caves, they have two options for reaching the site:": "一旦人物决定参观海龙洞，他们有两个选项可以到达该地点。",

	"The myconids' initial attitude toward outsiders is hostile (see \"{@book Social Interaction|PHB|8|Social Interaction}\" in the {@book Basic Rules|PHB}). They aren't malicious, though, and they don't resort to violence immediately. {@creature Myconid Adult||Adults} use their Rapport Spores to telepathically warn visitors to leave. (See \"Rapport Spores\" below for details about this form of communication.) {@creature Myconid Sprout||Sprouts} flee toward the nearest adults to warn them of intruders. If the characters attack, the myconids defend themselves.": "菌类对外来者的最初态度是敌对的（见{@book Basic Rules|PHB}中的\"{@book Social Interaction|PHB|8|Social Interaction}\"）。不过他们并不恶意，也不会立即诉诸暴力。{@creature Myconid Adult||Adults}使用他们的和睦孢子以心灵感应方式警告访客离开。(参见下面的 \"和睦孢子\"，了解这种交流方式的细节。) {@creature Myconid Sprout||Sprouts}逃向最近的成年人，警告他们有入侵者。如果角色攻击，菌类会自我防御。",
	"To convince a hostile myconid to converse or to allow the characters to do anything other than leave the caves, a character must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma check. Depending on the character's approach, the {@skill Deception}, {@skill Intimidation}, or {@skill Persuasion} skill can apply to the check. Mentioning Tarak's name or presenting the offering he sent the myconids grants advantage on this check.": "为了说服敌方菌类交谈或允许角色做任何事情，而不是离开洞穴，角色必须在DC20的魅力检查中取得成功。根据角色的方法，{@skill Deception}、{@skill Intimidation}或{@skill Persuasion}的技能可以适用于该检查。提及塔拉克的名字或出示他送给菌类的祭品，可以在这个检查中获得优势。",
	"An indifferent myconid is willing to explain what is going on in Seagrow Caves. The sprouts know only that their leader, {@creature Sinensa|DoSI}, has fallen ill—and that a nasty smell pervades their caves. Adult myconids know that the \"crystal cave\" ({@area area B6|06b|x}) is the source of the foul odor and that Sinensa fell ill after going into that cave to investigate the issue. The myconids normally avoid that cave because sunlight filters into it by way of the vent at the western end of the cave, and even diffuse sunlight is unpleasant to these cave-dwelling creatures.": "一个冷漠的霉菌愿意解释海草洞里发生的事情。芽胞们只知道他们的领袖{@creature Sinensa|DoSI}病倒了，而且他们的洞穴里弥漫着一股讨厌的气味。成年菌类知道 \"水晶洞\"（%%）是恶臭的源头，而辛恩萨是在进入那个洞穴调查问题后生病的。霉菌类通常会避开那个洞穴，因为阳光会通过洞穴西端的通风口进入洞穴，而即使是漫天的阳光也会让这些穴居生物感到不快。",
	"A myconid's Rapport Spores ability allows all intelligent creatures in the area to communicate telepathically with each other. The characters and the myconids are effectively speaking thoughts at each other. This effect doesn't allow any creature to probe invasively into another creature's mind. But it transcends language barriers, and you can play around with the kind of communication that the spores allow. Myconids' facial expressions might be difficult to read, but their telepathic communication might carry a direct expression of the myconids' emotional state. For example, when the myconids talk about their ailing leader, the characters might feel a deep sadness and a sense of anxiety much more clearly and powerfully than mere words and facial expressions can communicate.": "菌类的和睦孢子能力允许该地区的所有智能生物彼此进行心灵感应。角色和菌类实际上是在互相说想法。这个效果并不允许任何生物侵入另一个生物的心灵。但它超越了语言障碍，而且你可以玩弄孢子所允许的那种交流方式。霉菌的面部表情可能很难读懂，但它们的心灵感应可能带有霉菌的情绪状态的直接表达。例如，当菌类谈论他们生病的领袖时，人物可能会感受到一种深深的悲伤和焦虑感，这比单纯的语言和面部表情所能传达的要清楚和有力得多。",
	"The effect of Rapport Spores lasts for 1 hour, so characters might be telepathically linked to each other whenever they're within 30 feet of each other even after they leave the cave. Encourage the players to think about how this might affect their characters. Does it make them feel closer to their friends? Does it ease any suspicions they might have had about each other?": "和谐孢子的效果持续1小时，所以只要角色在30英尺范围内，即使他们离开了洞穴，也可能会彼此心灵感应。鼓励玩家思考这可能对他们的角色产生什么影响。这是否会使他们感到与朋友更亲近？这是否会减轻他们对彼此的怀疑？",
	"When myconids take damage, they release spores that alert all other myconids within 240 feet of them. All myconids in the cave are in range of each other's Distress Spores. Myconids in {@area areas B2|05b|x} and {@area B3|063|x} move to {@area area B4|066|x} if they detect Distress Spores.": "当菌类受到伤害时，它们会释放孢子，提醒周围240英尺内的所有其他菌类。洞穴中的所有菌类都在彼此的求救孢子的范围内。在{@area areas B2|05b|x}和{@area B3|063|x}的菌类如果探测到危难孢子，就会移动到{@area area B4|066|x}。",

The surface of the water swirls with colorful, faintly glowing spores—perhaps reacting to the movement of something under the surface.": "五颜六色的真菌覆盖了这条隧道的墙壁，其生物发光的光芒让洞穴充满了昏暗的光线。水面上旋转着五颜六色、微弱发光的孢子--也许是对水面下某物的运动产生了反应。",
	"As described on the previous page, the water level here varies by up to 10 feet with the tides. At high tide, the water is about 8 feet deep along the edges of the tunnel and 25 feet deep in the middle.

	"This fifty-foot-high cavern is a forest of multicolored fungi, ranging from tiny filaments to tree-sized mushrooms. A natural staircase of stone columns along the east wall leads up ten feet to a higher cave area in the north. Water burbles down from that upper cave and collects in a large pool. Two small mushroom-like people are working amid the mushrooms near the pond. A sickening smell, like sulfur, hangs in the air.": "这个五十英尺高的洞穴是一片五彩缤纷的真菌森林，从细小的丝状物到树状物大小的蘑菇。沿着东墙有一个由石柱组成的天然楼梯，通向北部一个更高的洞穴区，有十英尺高。水从那个较高的洞穴中迸发下来，聚集在一个大水池中。两个像蘑菇一样的小人正在池塘边的蘑菇中工作。空气中弥漫着一股令人作呕的气味，像硫磺一样。",
	"The waterfall is fed from a pool in the upper cave, which in turn is supplied by runoff trickling down from the surface. Both pools are 5 feet deep at most.": "瀑布的水源来自于上层洞穴的一个水池，而这个水池的水源又来自于地表涓涓流下的径流。这两个池子最多只有5英尺深。",
	"The two mushroom people are {@creature Myconid Sprout||myconid sprouts} named Molen and Kraz.

	"If the characters move into the cave toward the myconids, one violet fungus attacks them, extending long tendrils that cause immediate rot when they touch living flesh. Read this text:": "如果人物进入洞穴走向菌类，有一种紫罗兰真菌就会攻击他们，伸出长长的卷须，一碰到活人的肉就会立即腐烂。阅读此文。",
	"As you advance into the cave, a sickly looking mushroom suddenly stirs to life. It extends long purple tendrils toward you and moves slowly across the cave floor on root-like tendrils.": "当你进入山洞时，一个看起来病怏怏的蘑菇突然活了过来。它向你伸出长长的紫色卷须，并以根状的卷须在洞穴地面上缓慢移动。",
	"Because the violet fungi move so slowly, it's easy for the characters to stay out of their reach and kill the fungus monsters with ranged attacks. The interesting part of this encounter is identifying the danger. One violet fungus moves and attacks to start the encounter, but the other two remain motionless until characters move close to them.": "由于紫罗兰真菌的移动速度很慢，角色们很容易在它们的范围之外，用远程攻击杀死真菌怪兽。这个遭遇战的有趣之处在于识别危险。一只紫罗兰真菌开始移动并攻击，但另外两只真菌一动不动，直到角色靠近它们。",
	"You don't need to keep track of exactly where everyone is standing in the room. Instead, rely on your sense of what's fun and exciting. When a character moves away from an active violet fungus, have another fungus stir and attack that character on the fungus's next turn. If a character scans the fungus farm looking for more violet fungi, cast as much doubt as you can: many of the fungi look sickly and purple but pose no danger.": "你不需要准确记录每个人在房间里的位置。相反，依靠你对什么是有趣和刺激的感觉。当一个角色远离一个活跃的紫罗兰真菌时，让另一个真菌搅动并在真菌的下一回合攻击该角色。如果一个角色在真菌农场里寻找更多的紫罗兰真菌，请尽可能多地提出疑问：许多真菌看起来是病态的、紫色的，但不构成危险。",
	"If the characters defeat the violet fungi, the myconids' attitude improves to indifferent, and they are willing to speak to the characters (using their Rapport Spores). The adults agree to accompany the characters and vouch for them with the rest of the myconid colony, improving the other myconids' attitude to indifferent as well.": "如果角色们打败了紫罗兰真菌，菌类的态度就会改善到无所谓，而且它们愿意和角色们说话（使用它们的和睦孢子）。成年人同意陪伴角色，并为他们与其他的霉菌群做担保，使其他霉菌的态度也改善为冷漠。",
	"A character who examines any of the fungi notices that many of the mushrooms are sickly, shriveled, and blotched with black patches of decay. The blight has no obvious source.": "检查任何一种真菌的人都会注意到，许多蘑菇都是病态的，干瘪的，并有黑色的腐烂斑点。这种病症没有明显的来源。",
	"The fungus farm contains heart cap mushrooms ready for harvest. A character who spends 15 minutes searching this chamber for useful fungi and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) or Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check finds {@dice 1d6} of these reddish mushrooms, which bear an unsettling resemblance to human hearts. Tarak can make each heart cap mushroom into a {@item potion of healing}.": "真菌农场里有准备收获的心形帽蘑菇。花15分钟在这个房间里寻找有用的真菌，并在DC12智力（{@skill Nature}）或智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查中获得成功的角色可以找到{@dice 1d6}这种红色的蘑菇，它们与人类的心脏有着令人不安的相似之处。塔拉克可以将每个心帽菇做成一个（3%）。",

	"Two {@creature Myconid Adult||myconid adults} named Auranta and Enok are tending the {@condition unconscious} myconid who leads this colony, {@creature Sinensa|DoSI}. The adults collect spores from a barrel-sized, glowing red fungus that vaguely resembles a human brain and puff the spores around the leader's head. The treatment is keeping the leader alive for now, but it is a losing battle. Sinensa's only hope is for the blight to end. The adults zealously defend their leader, immediately attacking intruders who aren't accompanied by other myconids.": "两个名叫奥兰塔和伊诺克的{@creature Myconid Adult||myconid adults}正在照看领导这个菌群的{@condition unconscious}菌类，{@creature Sinensa|DoSI}。成年人从一个木桶大小、发光的红色真菌中收集孢子，这个真菌依稀像人的大脑，并将孢子扑在领袖的头上。这种治疗方法目前还能让领袖活着，但这是一场失败的战斗。辛恩萨唯一的希望是让瘟疫结束。成年人狂热地保护他们的领袖，立即攻击没有其他菌类陪伴的入侵者。",
	"The air in this cave is choked with thick smoke that assaults your nostrils with a pungent odor of brimstone. Strange, flickering orange light illuminates the smoke. This area is free of fungal growth; instead, crystals grow from the rock. To your right, a large cluster of purple crystals juts from the stone. On the far wall, a glowing orange crystal wedged into a fissure in the cave wall seems to be the source of the light. Streaks of soot trace a path along the cave walls between the purple crystals and the fissure.": "这个洞穴里的空气被浓厚的烟雾所窒息，用硫磺的刺鼻气味袭击你的鼻孔。奇怪的、闪烁的橙色灯光照亮了这些烟雾。这个区域没有真菌生长；相反，岩石上长出了晶体。在你的右边，有一大簇紫色的晶体从石头上突出来。在远处的墙壁上，一块发光的橙色晶体夹在洞壁的裂缝中，似乎是光的来源。在紫色晶体和裂缝之间的洞壁上，有条烟灰的痕迹。",
	"This cave is the source of the blight spreading through the myconid colony. As the characters explore the cave, they can easily determine that noxious fumes from deep beneath the island seep up around the vein of purple crystals. Ordinarily, the fumes vent to the surface through a fissure in the west wall, but the fissure is now blocked by the enormous orange crystal, which is also the source of the light here.": "这个洞穴是疫病在菌类殖民地蔓延的源头。当角色们探索这个洞穴时，他们可以很容易地确定，来自岛屿地下深处的有毒气体在紫色晶体的静脉周围渗出。通常情况下，这些烟雾会通过西墙的裂缝排放到地面上，但现在裂缝被巨大的橙色水晶挡住了，这也是这里光线的来源。",
	"The heart of the problem is the tomb of the red dragon Sharruth, deep beneath the island. The presence of such a powerful dragon far underground causes the volcanic activity that produces the noxious fumes. What's more, the dragon's energy occasionally tears open small rifts in the fabric of reality that lead to the Elemental Plane of Fire—another dimension of reality that is the cosmic source of fiery energy. The Plane of Fire is the origin of both the orange crystal blocking the vent (which is actually an egg case) and the creatures currently in the cave.": "问题的核心是红龙沙鲁特的坟墓，在岛屿的深处。如此强大的龙在地下深处的存在导致了火山活动，产生了有毒的烟雾。更重要的是，龙的能量偶尔会撕开现实结构中的小裂缝，通往火元素位面--现实的另一个维度，是炽热能量的宇宙来源。火之界是堵住通风口的橙色水晶（实际上是一个蛋壳）和目前洞穴中的生物的起源。",
	"Breaking the fire crystal also reveals the reason the myconids avoid this cave: the cave is immediately filled with shimmering sunlight refracted through the crystals that line the vent. Bright light fills the entire area.": "打破火晶也揭示了菌类避开这个洞穴的原因：洞穴里立即充满了通过排在通风口的水晶折射出来的闪亮的阳光。明亮的光线充满了整个区域。",
	"The fire snake's egg breaks into 25 tiny chunks of obsidian worth 10 gp each.": "火蛇蛋碎成25块小黑曜石，每块价值10戈比。",
	"If the characters destroy the orange crystal so the toxic fumes can escape the caves, the myconids' attitude improves to friendly. Sinensa, the myconid leader, regains consciousness the following morning. If the characters are present when Sinensa awakens, Sinensa gives them the ruby morel from {@area area B5|068|x} and permission to keep any other treasure or mushrooms they collected in the caves.": "如果角色们摧毁了橙色晶体，使有毒气体能够逃离洞穴，霉菌的态度就会改善，变得友好。菌类的领袖Sinensa在第二天早上恢复了意识。如果人物在辛恩萨醒来时在场，辛恩萨会给他们{@area area B5|068|x}的红宝石羊肚菌，并允许他们保留在洞穴中收集的任何其他宝物或蘑菇。",
	"After they complete this chapter of the adventure, the characters gain a level. If they visited Seagrow Caves before the wreck of {@i Compass Rose}, they advance from 1st level to 2nd level.

This also breaks the curse—the characters still feel something like a sigh in the air, fog rises up to engulf the wreck while the characters are rowing away, and the ship is gone when the fog lifts the next day.": "角色们也可以无视船长日记中的话，在船上销毁护身符。这也打破了诅咒--人物仍然感觉到空气中弥漫着一种叹息，当人物划船离开时，雾气升起吞噬了沉船，第二天雾气散去时，船就不见了。",
	"If the characters undo the talisman's curse, the next time they sleep, the cleric character has another dream. Read this text to the cleric's player:": "如果角色解除了神器的诅咒，那么在他们下次睡觉时，教士角色又会做一个梦。把这段文字读给教士的玩家听。",
	"In your dream, you are once again on the deck of the ship that brought you here, and you see Stormwreck Isle shrouded in darkness, just as it was in your earlier dreams. As you sail closer, the darkness breaks, and a dazzling ray of sunlight shines down over the island. A gentle plume of white smoke rises up from the island as the darkness is driven away. Then the darkness and the smoke are gone, the light swells to enfold you as well, and you feel the love and approval of your god.": "在你的梦中，你又一次站在把你带到这里的那艘船的甲板上，你看到风暴残骸岛笼罩在黑暗中，就像你先前的梦中一样。当你驶近时，黑暗被打破，一束耀眼的阳光照在岛上。当黑暗被驱走时，一缕柔和的白烟从岛上升起。然后，黑暗和烟雾都消失了，光明也涌向你，你感觉到你的神的爱和认可。",
	"After they complete this chapter of the adventure, the characters gain a level. If they visited {@i Compass Rose} before Seagrow Caves, they advance to 2nd level. The residents of Dragon's Rest urge them to visit Seagrow Caves next (see \"{@area Sea Caves|033|x}\").

	"This chapter assumes the characters visit the observatory after exploring Seagrow Caves and the wreck of {@i Compass Rose}, and thus have reached 3rd level. If they come here before visiting the other adventure sites, the combat encounters are probably too difficult for them. That's the reason Runara won't give the characters the moonstone key or information about the observatory until after they've dealt with the island's other problems. If necessary, you can have Runara warn the characters that they're not ready to face this part of the adventure yet.": "本章假设人物在探索了海格罗洞穴和{@i Compass Rose}的残骸后访问了天文台，因此已经达到了第三级。如果他们在参观其他冒险地点之前来到这里，那么战斗遭遇对他们来说可能太难了。这就是Runara在处理完岛上的其他问题后才会给人物月光石钥匙或关于天文台的信息的原因。如果有必要，你可以让Runara警告人物，他们还没有准备好面对冒险的这一部分。",
	"During its heyday, the Clifftop Observatory was a marvel of magical innovation. Adorned with gorgeous stained glass windows and marble spires, the observatory's towers stood high above the churning sea on separate islets, linked by shimmering bridges of magical energy. But the observatory was wrecked when Runara battled her blue dragon rival centuries ago, and now it lies in ruin, a crumbled memory overtaken by nature.": "在其全盛时期，悬崖顶天文台是一个神奇的创新奇迹。在华丽的彩色玻璃窗和大理石尖顶的装饰下，天文台的塔楼高高地矗立在汹涌的海面上，由闪闪发光的魔法能量桥连接。但天文台在几个世纪前鲁纳拉与她的蓝龙对手作战时被毁了，现在它躺在废墟中，成为被大自然吞噬的破碎记忆。",
	"About five days before the characters arrived on the island, a {@creature bronze dragon wyrmling} named Aidron left the safety of Dragon's Rest and Runara's tutelage and came to the ancient observatory. The two wyrmlings met and immediately clashed.

Ultimately, Sparkrender overpowered Aidron and imprisoned him in the observatory ruins.": "在人物到达岛上的大约五天前，一个名叫艾德隆的{@creature bronze dragon wyrmling}离开了安全的龙息和鲁纳拉的监护，来到了古老的天文台。两只巫妖相遇并立即发生了冲突。斯帕克雷德试图让青铜狼人反对鲁纳拉，但艾德隆对色龙的憎恨比他与鲁纳拉的分歧更强烈。最终，斯帕克雷德制服了艾德隆，并将他囚禁在天文台的废墟中。",
	"Sparkrender believes Aidron is the key to unlocking the observatory's magic and claiming his ancestor's power. With the bronze wyrmling imprisoned, Sparkrender began planning a ritual that will awaken the spirits of all the island's dead dragons and bind them to his will—at the cost of Aidron's life.": "Sparkrender相信Aidron是解开天文台魔法的关键，并能获得他祖先的力量。随着青铜暴龙被囚禁，Sparkrender开始计划一个仪式，唤醒岛上所有死去的龙的灵魂，并将它们与他的意志结合起来--代价是Aidron的生命。",

Alternatively, you could tie the boat up at the bottom of the columns and try to climb directly up to the ruins.": "当你绕过岛屿的东南端时，你可以看到位于玄武岩柱顶的摇摇欲坠的废墟，就在主岛体外。如果你把船停在岛上，就可以很容易地走到悬崖顶上，尽管从悬崖到废墟没有明显的桥梁。另外，你也可以把船拴在柱子的底部，然后试着直接爬到废墟上。",

	"Once the stirges have been defeated, if the kobolds survive, they approach the characters. Their names are Mek and Minn, and they're the brothers of Myla, the kobold tinkerer at Dragon's Rest.

These are the names and colors of the five dragons:": "搅拌器的攻击打断了哥布林们为斯帕克雷德的仪式准备这个场地的指定任务。在巫妖的帮助下，他们把五块碎石粗略地雕刻成隐约的龙形，并在每块碎石上泼上颜料，而哥布林们正在把它们摆放在金属雕塑的周围。每个雕像上都刻有它所代表的龙的名字。这些是五条龙的名字和颜色。",

The fight will be easier for the characters with Aidron on their side, but they can still triumph without Aidron's help.": "斯帕克雷德{@creature blue dragon wyrmling}目前正在这里睡觉，蜷缩在东北面的墙上。这给角色们提出了一个重要的选择：他们可以唤醒龙，现在就和他战斗，或者他们可以偷偷越过龙，找到进入下面的秘密图书馆({@adventure area {@dice D6}|DoSI|4|D6: Secret Library})的方法并释放{@creature Bronze Dragon Wyrmling||Aidron}，然后在艾德隆的帮助下和斯帕克雷德战斗。两种方法都可以。有艾德隆在身边的角色，战斗会更容易，但没有艾德隆的帮助，他们仍然可以取得胜利。",
	"You don't need to encourage one course of action or the other. Make sure the players realize they have a choice, though. You can use Mek and Minn (the kobolds from {@adventure {@dice D2}|DoSI|4|D2: Rotunda Ruins}) to remind the characters there's another dragon around. As you describe the observatory tower, you can also highlight the caved-in wall beneath it (leading to area {@dice D6}) as a potential point of access to the tower. Or you can just tell the players they have these two options—plus any others they come up with on their own!": "你不需要鼓励一个或另一个行动方案。不过要确保玩家意识到他们有选择权。你可以用Mek和Minn（{@adventure {@dice D2}|DoSI|4|D2: Rotunda Ruins}中的哥布林）来提醒角色，周围还有一条龙。在你描述观察塔的时候，你也可以强调它下面凹陷的墙（通向{@dice D6}区域），作为进入塔的一个潜在点。或者你可以直接告诉玩家，他们有这两个选择--再加上他们自己想出来的任何其他选择。",
	"If the characters try to turn the statues (see \"{@area Hidden Entrance|0bd|x}\" below) without waking Sparkrender, have the characters turning the north and east statues (nearest the sleeping dragon) each make a DC 14 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check.

	"Despite his youth, {@creature Blue Dragon Wyrmling||Sparkrender} is a fearsome foe and a loathsome villain. He uses Breath Weapon on his first turn and every round it is available thereafter.

Each shimmering display seems to originate from one of the five dragon effigies you saw before, and the lights' colors match the colors of the effigies: red, gold, brass, blue, and bronze. A blue dragon is perched atop the sculpture, throwing his head back in pain or ecstasy as the lights surround him, and he unleashes a bolt of lightning up toward the sky. At the base of the statue, a bronze dragon is bound to the ground by three heavy chains. He looks like he's in agony.": "彩色的光流在废墟圆形大厅的金色雕像周围的空气中旋转。每一个闪亮的显示似乎来自于你之前看到的五座龙像中的一座，灯光的颜色与龙像的颜色一致：红色、金色、黄铜色、蓝色和青铜色。一条蓝龙栖息在雕塑的顶端，当灯光围绕着他时，他痛苦或狂喜地甩着头，并向天空释放出一道闪电。在雕像的底部，一条青铜龙被三条沉重的锁链绑在地上。他看起来很痛苦的样子。",

He was laid to rest in the graveyard atop the cliffs at the northern point of the island, northwest of Dragon's Rest.": "如果人物在船舱里找到Aleitha的护身符，他们可以完全解决僵尸问题。如果他们把护身符带给{@creature Runara|DoSI}，并解释他们在船长日志中发现的东西，{@creature Runara|DoSI}会难过地点点头。她记得阿莱塔的丈夫布拉斯托斯，但他多年前就死了。他被安葬在岛屿北端悬崖顶上的墓地里，在龙息岛的西北方。",
	"This chapter assumes the characters visit the observatory after exploring Seagrow Caves and the wreck of {@i Compass Rose}, and thus have reached 3rd level. If they come here before visiting the other adventure sites, the combat encounters are probably too difficult for them. That's the reason {@creature Runara|DoSI} won't give the characters the moonstone key or information about the observatory until after they've dealt with the island's other problems. If necessary, you can have {@creature Runara|DoSI} warn the characters that they're not ready to face this part of the adventure yet.": "本章假设人物在探索了海草洞和{@i Compass Rose}的残骸后访问了天文台，因此已经达到了第三级。如果他们在参观其他冒险地点之前来到这里，那么战斗遭遇对他们来说可能太难了。这就是{@creature Runara|DoSI}在他们处理完岛上的其他问题后才会给人物月光石钥匙或关于天文台的信息的原因。如果有必要，你可以让{@creature Runara|DoSI}警告角色，他们还没有准备好面对冒险的这一部分。",
	"During its heyday, the Clifftop Observatory was a marvel of magical innovation. Adorned with gorgeous stained glass windows and marble spires, the observatory's towers stood high above the churning sea on separate islets, linked by shimmering bridges of magical energy. But the observatory was wrecked when {@creature Runara|DoSI} battled her blue dragon rival centuries ago, and now it lies in ruin, a crumbled memory overtaken by nature.": "在其全盛时期，悬崖顶天文台是一个神奇的创新奇迹。在华丽的彩色玻璃窗和大理石尖顶的装饰下，天文台的塔楼高高地矗立在汹涌的海面上，由闪闪发光的魔法能量桥连接。但在几个世纪前，天文台在与她的蓝龙对手的战斗中被毁坏了，现在它躺在废墟中，成为被自然界淹没的破碎的记忆。",
	"In recent months, the observatory ruins have become the home of an arrogant {@creature blue dragon wyrmling} called Sparkrender, a descendant of {@creature Runara|DoSI}'s ancient rival. Like his ancestor, Sparkrender seeks to claim the destructive magic that lingers at the site. Like {@creature Runara|DoSI}, Sparkrender has recruited kobolds to join his cause.": "最近几个月，天文台的废墟成了一个傲慢的{@creature blue dragon wyrmling}叫Sparkrender的人的家，他是{@creature Runara|DoSI}古代对手的后代。就像他的祖先一样，Sparkrender试图获得萦绕在这个地方的破坏性魔法。和{@creature Runara|DoSI}一样，Sparkrender也招募了哥布林来加入他的事业。",
	"If the characters actively helped the kobolds or mention that {@creature Myla|DoSI} is alive, the kobolds' attitude becomes friendly. They offer to introduce the characters to their leader and help the characters in any way they can (such as retrieving the moonstone key from {@adventure area {@dice D1}|DoSI|4|D1: Overlook} so the characters can activate the bridge to {@adventure {@dice D4}|DoSI|4|D4: Isolated Study}). They won't help the characters fight Sparkrender, though; they are loyal to the dragon.": "如果角色积极帮助哥布林或提到{@creature Myla|DoSI}还活着，哥布林的态度就会变得友好。他们会主动将角色介绍给他们的首领，并以任何方式帮助角色（比如从{@adventure area {@dice D1}|DoSI|4|D1.Overlook}取回月光石钥匙，这样角色就可以激活通往{@adventure {@dice D4}|DoSI|4|D1.Overlook}的桥梁。俯瞰}，这样人物就可以激活通往{@adventure {@dice D4}|DoSI|4|D4: 孤立的书房}的桥梁）。不过他们不会帮助角色与斯帕克雷德战斗，他们对龙很忠诚。",
	"Another possibility is that the characters drive Sparkrender away from the island without killing him, but leave Aidron imprisoned in {@adventure area {@dice D6}|DoSI|4|D6: Secret Library}. In this case, {@creature Runara|DoSI} urges the characters to return to the observatory to find Aidron. When they arrive, Sparkrender has also rested, healed, and returned to finish his work.": "另一种可能是，角色们把斯帕克雷德赶出了小岛，但却把艾德隆囚禁在{@adventure area {@dice D6}|DoSI|4|D6: Secret Library}。在这种情况下，{@creature Runara|DoSI}敦促角色们回到天文台去找艾德隆。当他们到达时，斯帕克雷德也已经休息好了，痊愈了，并回来完成他的工作。",
	"With Aidron in tow, the characters can return victorious to Dragon's Rest. {@creature Runara|DoSI} is pleased by the bronze wyrmling's safe return. As a reward, she gives each of the characters a {@item potion of healing} and an exquisite {@item pearl} worth 100 gp. She welcomes them to stay at Dragon's Rest as long as they wish and furnishes them with whatever supplies they need for their travels when they're ready to leave the island. If Sparkrender is dead, she grieves the death of yet another dragon on Stormwreck Isle, but she doesn't condemn the characters for killing him.": "在艾德隆的带领下，人物可以胜利地回到龙之谷。{@creature Runara|DoSI}对青铜巫妖的安全返回感到高兴。作为奖励，她给了每个角色一个{@item potion of healing}和一个精致的{@item pearl}，价值100金币。她欢迎他们在 \"龙之休息站 \"呆多久都可以，当他们准备离开这个岛的时候，她会给他们提供旅行所需的任何物资。如果斯帕克雷德死了，她会为风暴残骸岛上又一条龙的死亡感到悲伤，但她不会谴责杀死他的角色。"
