	"The Snout of Omgar is a geographical region {@adventure described briefly|ToA|2|Snout of Omgar} in {@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA}. Not much is revealed about the location or its inhabitants in that adventure, however. The Tortle Package is written for Dungeon Masters who want to know more about the Snout of Omgar. This supplement also introduces a new playable character race, the {@race tortle|ttp}, and a new adventure location: {@adventure Dangwaru, the Typhoon Palace|ttp|3|Dangwaru (The Typhoon Palace)}.": "奥格尔的鼻孔是{@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA}的一个地理区域{@adventure described briefly|ToA|2|Snout of Omgar}。然而，在那次冒险中，关于这个地方和它的居民并没有透露多少信息。Tortle包是为那些想了解奥格尔之鼻的地下城主编写的。这个补充文件还介绍了一个新的可玩角色种族--{@race tortle|ttp}，以及一个新的冒险地点。{@adventure Dangwaru, the Typhoon Palace|ttp|3|Dangwaru (The Typhoon Palace)}.",
	"Tortles are intelligent, turtle-like humanoids that have a knack for wilderness survival. The race first appeared in early editions of the D&D game, nowhere more prominently than in module X9, The Savage Coast, which was set in the world of Mystara. Tortles, like most other adventurous races, can appear on any D&D world. In the Forgotten Realms, the {@adventure peninsula of Chult|ToA|2} and the Snout of Omgar make good homes for them.": "龟甲人是一种聪明的、类似乌龟的人形生物，有在野外生存的本领。该种族首次出现在D&D游戏的早期版本中，其中最突出的是X9模块 \"野蛮海岸\"，该模块设定在Mystara世界。托尔人，像其他大多数冒险种族一样，可以出现在任何D&D世界。在被遗忘的世界里，{@adventure peninsula of Chult|ToA|2}和奥格尔的鼻孔是它们的好家。",

If a stat block appears elsewhere, the text tells you so.": "{@book Monster Manual|mm}、{@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|vgm}和{@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA}包含了这里发现的大多数生物的状态块，还有一些新的怪物出现在本补编的最后。当一个生物的名字以{@bold bold}的字体出现时，那是一个视觉提示，指向{@book Monster Manual|mm}中的状态块。如果一个状态块出现在其他地方，文字会告诉你。",
	"The Snout of Omgar was once a peninsula, but upheaval wrought by the Spellplague broke off the tip of the peninsula, creating an island separated from mainland Chult by a narrow strait. When the separation occurred, tortles living in the vicinity claimed the island as their domain. The strait provided a natural defense against aggressive mainland predators.": "奥格尔之鼻曾经是一个半岛，但咒语瘟疫造成的动荡使半岛的顶端断裂，形成了一个与丘特大陆隔着一条狭窄海峡的岛屿。当分离发生时，生活在附近的托尔人声称该岛是他们的领地。海峡提供了一个天然的防御手段，以抵御大陆上的侵略性掠食者。",
	"Over time, the island's {@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|SCAG} worshipers died off, and the palace fell into ruin. Descendants of the tortles who built the {@adventure Typhoon Palace|ttp|3|Dangwaru (The Typhoon Palace)} soon discovered evil creatures lurking within. Older tortles wisely shun the ruined palace, but younger tortles occasionally try to explore it as a rite of passage. Few of them get far before strange monsters frighten them away.": "随着时间的推移，岛上的{@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|SCAG}崇拜者逐渐死去，宫殿也陷入废墟。建造{@adventure Typhoon Palace|ttp|3|Dangwaru (The Typhoon Palace)}的托尔人的后代很快发现里面潜伏着邪恶的生物。年长的托特人明智地避开了废墟宫殿，但年轻的托特人偶尔会尝试探索它，作为一种成年仪式。他们中很少有人走远了，就被奇怪的怪物吓跑了。",

Zhanthi offers a 1,000 gp reward to adventurers who are willing to visit each of the island's landmarks and report back to her with news of their discoveries. {@adventure Zhanthi|ToA|1|Zhanthi} gives them the map and arranges for a fast ship ({@adventure the Brazen Pegasus|ToA|1|Harbor Ward}) to transport them to the island.": "{@adventure Port Nyanzaru|ToA|1}的商人王子们对他们城市里越来越多的{@filter yuan-ti|bestiary|tag=yuan-ti}间谍感到担忧，担心蛇人族正计划暗杀他们。在一个试图潜入{@adventure Merchant Prince Zhanthi's|ToA|1|Zhanthi}家庭的被杀{@creature yuan-ti pureblood|mm}间谍的尸体上发现了一张奥格尔之鼻的地图。湛西为那些愿意访问岛上每个地标并向她报告发现的消息的冒险者提供了1000金币的奖励。{@adventure Zhanthi|ToA|1|Zhanthi}给他们地图，并安排一艘快船({@adventure the Brazen Pegasus|ToA|1|Harbor Ward})运送他们到岛上。",

He lost more than he won but caught the eye of the {@adventure Merchant Prince Jobal|ToA|1|Jobal}, who convinced him there was more profit in wilderness exploration.
