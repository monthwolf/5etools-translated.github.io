	"Rumored to be associated with metallic dragons, the Golden Vault is a secretive organization that has its base on one of the good-aligned Outer Planes. Its membership and activities are almost impossible for outsiders to track, but those in the know are aware that the organization rights moral wrongs, supports virtuous underdogs, and handles delicate situations local authorities won't touch.

	"Once an adventuring group proves itself effective and virtuous, an operative approaches the characters to offer Golden Vault membership. Should the group accept, its members join the ranks of the Golden Vault, and the person who invited them becomes their handler for future missions. For an example of a handler, see the \"{@area Meera Raheer|009|x}\" section.": "一旦一个冒险团证明自己是有效的、有德行的，一个特工就会接近这些人物，提供黄金库的成员资格。如果该团体接受，其成员就会加入金库的行列，而邀请他们的人就会成为他们未来任务的负责人。关于联络人的例子，见\"{@area Meera Raheer|009|x} \"部分。\"做好事，不计代价\"。金库的任务往往是非法的，但它们总是支持一个公正的、道德的事业。",

	"When Meera was young, her kindhearted and upstanding mothers served as city clerks. But when they began investigating financial irregularities, the unscrupulous mayor framed them for embezzlement to cover his own corruption. The only evidence of the Raheers' innocence was a packet of letters between the mayor and his conspirators. The letters were locked in the mayor's office.": "当米拉年轻时，她善良和正直的母亲担任城市书记员。但当她们开始调查财务违规行为时，无良的市长为了掩盖自己的腐败行为而诬陷她们贪污。证明拉赫夫妇清白的唯一证据是市长和他的同谋者之间的一包信件。这些信被锁在市长的办公室里。",
	"Luckily for the Raheers, a crew of Golden Vault operatives infiltrated city hall, retrieved the letters, and revealed the mayor's crimes. The Raheers kept fighting against government corruption, and Meera has followed in her parents' footsteps, continuing their anti-corruption work by becoming a city's clerk and a member of the Golden Vault.": "幸运的是，一群金库特工潜入市政厅，取回了这些信件，并揭露了市长的罪行。拉赫夫妇继续与政府腐败作斗争，米拉也追随她父母的脚步，继续他们的反腐工作，成为一名城市的书记员和金库的一名成员。这些信被锁在市长的办公室里。",

	"Unforeseen complications are an iconic aspect of heist narratives. Whether they take the form of a rival crew appearing out of nowhere or a treasure that turns out to be fake, complications ratchet up the tension and require the characters to think on their feet.": "不可预见的复杂情况是抢劫案叙述的一个标志性方面。无论是突然出现的竞争对手，还是被证明是假的宝藏，复杂情况都会增加紧张感，并要求角色用自己的方式思考。",
	"If you want to challenge your players, consider adding one of the complications below to any of this book's adventures.": "如果你想挑战你的玩家，可以考虑在本书的任何一个冒险中加入下面的一个复杂情况。",
	"Many of this book's heists involve procuring a MacGuffin. Part of preparing for these heists is determining where the MacGuffin in question is located.": "本书中的许多抢劫案都涉及到采购MacGuffin。为这些抢劫做准备的部分工作是确定有关的MacGuffin的位置。",
	"If the characters are having too easy of a time finding the MacGuffin, consider shifting its location to another place that makes sense. Or consider revealing that the MacGuffin is a fake, and the real prize is still nearby. The characters should still be able to determine where it's really located.": "如果人物在寻找麦克格芬时太容易了，可以考虑将其位置转移到另一个有意义的地方。或者考虑透露麦克格芬是假的，而真正的奖品仍然在附近。人物应该仍然能够确定它的真正位置。",
	"For example, in \"{@adventure The Murkmire Malevolence|KftGV|1},\" perhaps the MacGuffin is no longer in the Gemstone Wing and is being stored in the museum's attic overnight. The characters could learn this detail by reading notes they discover in the curator's office or by questioning one of the museum guards.": "例如，在\"{@adventure The Murkmire Malevolence|KftGV|1} \"中，也许MacGuffin已经不在宝石翼，而是在博物馆的阁楼上存放了一夜。人物可以通过阅读他们在馆长办公室发现的笔记或询问博物馆的一个警卫来了解这个细节。",
	"If you use the moving MacGuffin complication, be careful of moving the MacGuffin more than once. Having trouble locating the object of the heist could unduly frustrate your players.": "如果你使用了移动麦克格芬的并发症，要小心移动麦克格芬超过一次。在确定抢劫对象的位置上遇到困难可能会使你的玩家感到沮丧。",
	"A rival crew vying for the same goal can increase the pressure on the characters. Regardless of your players' goal, once another crew appears, the adventure becomes a race to accomplish the objective first.": "争夺同一目标的敌对船员可以增加人物的压力。无论你的玩家的目标是什么，一旦另一个船员出现，冒险就会变成一场争先恐后地完成目标的比赛。",
	"You can add a rival crew to an adventure at any time. When you do, make it clear to the characters that they have competition. The characters might see evidence of their rivals, such as an alarm that has already been disabled or an {@condition incapacitated} guard. At some point, the characters might even catch their rivals trying to steal the adventure's MacGuffin from right under their noses!": "你可以在任何时候在冒险中加入对手的船员。当你这样做时，要让角色清楚地知道他们有竞争。角色们可能会看到对手的证据，比如一个已经被禁用的警报器或一个{@condition incapacitated}的警卫。在某些时候，角色们甚至可能抓到他们的对手试图在他们的眼皮底下偷取冒险中的麦克格芬！这时，他们就会发现，他们的对手已经在他们的眼皮底下了。",

	"On a recent expedition into the nearby Murkmire, the archaeologists unearthed a strange object. Light green, opaque, and with a gemstone-like sheen, this ovoid stone was covered in strange furrows. The stone seemed ritualistic in nature, but it matched no recorded historical practices, and no one could identify its composition. The more Dr. Dannell studied it, the more she became convinced this object, which the archaeologists dubbed the Murkmire Stone, was not created by any known civilization—and might be dangerous.": "在最近一次对附近的Murkmire的考察中，考古学家们发现了一个奇怪的物体。浅绿色，不透明，具有宝石般的光泽，这块卵形的石头上布满了奇怪的沟壑。这块石头似乎具有仪式感，但它与历史上记载的做法并不相符，而且没有人能够确定其成分。丹奈尔博士对它研究得越多，她就越相信这个被考古学家称为Murkmire石的物体不是由任何已知的文明创造的，而且可能是危险的。因此，在她毕业后，丹奈尔博士成为了瓦肯布洛夫的教员和野外科学家，陪同大学的考古人员在该地区进行挖掘。",

	"Dr. Dannell continued to research the strange stone. Her concern turned to dread when she found descriptions of similar objects in her occult tomes. These objects were, in fact, the eggs of eldritch creatures. She learned that such eggs lay dormant for generations, but once the eggs are unearthed, the creatures within rapidly develop and hatch. The resulting creatures are ravenous for raw meat and grow exponentially as they feed, eventually overwhelming entire villages. The eggs are nearly indestructible, but the tomes claim encasing them in crystal can neutralize them.": "Dannell博士继续研究这块奇怪的石头。当她在她的神秘学书籍中发现对类似物体的描述时，她的担忧变成了恐惧。事实上，这些物体是长生生物的卵。她了解到，这种蛋会休眠几代人，但一旦蛋被挖掘出来，里面的生物就会迅速发育和孵化。孵化出来的生物对生肉非常渴望，并在进食时成倍增长，最终压倒了整个村庄。这些蛋几乎是无坚不摧的，但文献中声称将它们包裹在水晶中可以中和它们。Rkenbluff的教员和野外科学家，陪同大学的考古人员在该地区进行挖掘。博物馆，偷蛋，并在它释放出长生不老的恐怖之前将其送还给Cassee Dannell博士，使其中和。",

	"If the characters come before Jarazoun posing as visitors with legitimate business at the hold, the efreeti treats them with indifference.

	"The ghost describes the events chronicled in the \"{@area What Really Happened|360|x}\" section, then asks the characters to release the spirits of Xeluan's heroic companions. Edino trapped their spirits in chunks of oztocanite (see {@area area X10|399|x}), and {@creature Rilago|KftGV} knows how to release them: each oztocanite fragment must be brought in physical contact with the giant's petrified remains (in {@area area X4|381|x}). Physical contact with Xeluan reduces each oztocanite fragment to dust and frees the spirit trapped inside it. Freed spirits manifest as motes of spectral light that the petrified giant seems to absorb.": "这个幽灵描述了\"{@area What Really Happened|360|x}\"部分中记录的事件，然后要求角色们释放Xeluan的英雄同伴的灵魂。Edino将他们的灵魂困在奥兹托坎石块中（见{@area area X10|399|x}），而{@creature Rilago|KftGV}知道如何释放它们：每个奥兹托坎石块必须与巨人的石化遗骸（在{@area area X4|381|x}）进行物理接触。与Xeluan进行物理接触会使每个奥兹托坎石块化为尘土，并释放其中被困的灵魂。被释放的灵魂会表现为幽灵光点，似乎被石化巨人吸收。",
	"Once the spirits of Xeluan's four companions are released from their oztocanite prisons, the characters can safely enter this crypt (the wraiths don't arise from their caskets) and reconvene with {@creature Rilago|KftGV}'s ghost. The ghost reveals that it can mend Xeluan's heart only by possessing the body of a hero and using its host to place the {@item shard of Xeluan|KftGV} where it belongs: with the rest of Xeluan's heart. The ghost then asks permission to possess one of the characters, leaving it up to the characters to decide which of them should become {@creature Rilago|KftGV}'s temporary host.": "一旦谢卢安的四位同伴的灵魂从他们的奥兹托卡尼特监狱中释放出来，角色们就可以安全地进入这个地下室（幽灵不会从棺材里出来），并与{@creature Rilago|KftGV}的幽灵重新相聚。幽灵透露只有通过操控一个英雄的身体，利用宿主将{@item shard of Xeluan|KftGV}放回到谢卢安的心中，才能修复谢卢安的心。然后幽灵请求允许操控其中一个角色，让角色们决定谁应该成为{@creature Rilago|KftGV}的临时宿主。",
	"{@creature Rilago|KftGV}'s offer to mend the giant's heart is genuine.

Only then can the ghost leave the crypt and return the {@item shard of Xeluan|KftGV} to its rightful place. When {@creature Rilago|KftGV}'s host touches the shard to the giant's heart, they bind as one.

	"If Xeluan's heart is mended, the earthquakes stop. Peace returns to Oztocan. {@creature Rilago|KftGV}'s redemption and the characters' heroism have strengthened the protective wards around Xeluan, rendering the giant impervious to further harm. No longer able to mine oztocanite from the giant, the Onyx Scar terminates its mining operation.": "如果谢鲁安的心得到修复，地震就会停止。和平将重返奥兹托坎。{@creature Rilago|KftGV}的救赎和角色们的英勇行为加强了围绕谢鲁安的保护结界，使这位巨人不再受到伤害。奥尼克斯之痕不再能从巨人身上开采奥兹托坎矿石，终止了挖矿行动。",

All towers also have doors that open onto the walkways of adjoining curtain walls, as well as trapdoors that open onto the towers' roofs.": "塔楼墙壁厚15英尺，由雕刻的玄武岩制成，并镶有箭孔。堡垒下层的塔楼({@area areas B2a, B2b,|4de|x})和({@area B3|4e2|x})高60英尺，而堡垒上层的塔楼(区域{@area B8|4f2|x})和({@area B9|4f4|x})高80英尺。塔楼每20英尺有一个内部楼层，内部墙壁上有通往各楼层之间的石阶楼梯。地图上显示的塔楼门可从地面进入。所有塔楼还有门可通往相邻帘墙的走道，以及可通往塔楼屋顶的活板门。",
	"Any fights or suspicious activities in the hold are reported to the {@creature efreeti} {@creature Jarazoun|KftGV}, who places the defenders on high alert. Even if Vrakir is at the hold, the defenders bring their reports to {@creature Jarazoun|KftGV} first, allowing him to deal with any trouble himself rather than risk Vrakir's ire. While on high alert, the hold's inhabitants can't be surprised, and {@creature Jarazoun|KftGV} responds personally to any further reports of trouble, arriving after 1 minute with two {@creature Salamander||salamanders} from {@area area B20|50d|x}. After 24 hours with no incidents, the hold goes off high alert.": "任何在货舱内发生的争斗或可疑活动都会报告给{@creature efreeti}的{@creature Jarazoun|KftGV}，后者会让防御者保持高度警惕。即使Vrakir在货舱内，防御者也会先将报告交给{@creature Jarazoun|KftGV}，让他自己处理任何麻烦，而不是冒着惹怒Vrakir的风险。在高度警惕状态下，货舱内的居民不会被突袭，{@creature Jarazoun|KftGV}会亲自回应任何进一步的麻烦报告，在1分钟后与来自{@area area B20|50d|x}的两名{@creature Salamander||salamanders}一同到达。如果在24小时内没有发生任何事件，货舱将解除高度警惕状态。",
	"Two {@creature erinyes} are stationed on the rooftops of the towers closest to the bridge. If the characters approach the gatehouse and give a sound reason for being here, the erinyes open the way (see \"Doors\" and \"Portcullises\" below), escort the characters to {@area area B10|4f6|x}, and announce their presence to the salamanders in {@area area B22|512|x} before returning to their posts.": "两名 {@creature erinyes} 驻守在靠近桥梁的塔楼上。如果角色接近门楼并提出合理的理由在这里，厄里尼斯会打开道路（见下文的“门”和“升降栅门”），护送角色到 {@area area B10|4f6|x}，并在返回岗位前向 {@area area B22|512|x} 的火蜥蜴宣布他们的到来。",
	"Most of the prisoners are too fearful to speak with visitors, but one prisoner named Venture (chaotic good, tiefling {@creature gladiator}) tries to get the characters' attention, seeing the party's arrival as a golden opportunity to escape. If the characters smuggle her some weapons, rope, and a grappling hook, Venture agrees to start a prison riot (see \"Prison Riot\" below).": "大多数囚犯都太害怕与访客交谈，但有一个名叫冒险（混乱善良，鬼族{@creature gladiator}）的囚犯试图引起角色们的注意，将队伍的到来视为逃跑的绝佳机会。如果角色们偷偷给她一些武器、绳索和抓钩，冒险就同意发动一场监狱暴动（见下文“监狱暴动”）。",
	"The passages into the hold's interior are blocked by portcullises. The winch to operate the northern portcullis is accessible from the yard. The winch to operate the southern portcullis is inside the passage leading to {@area area B11|4f9|x}. It takes 3 actions to raise a portcullis or 1 action to lower it using the winch. As an action, a creature can try to lift a portcullis above its head, doing so with a successful a DC 20 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check.": "货舱内的通道被升降栅栏挡住了。操作北侧升降栅栏的绞盘可以从院子里进入。操作南侧升降栅栏的绞盘位于通往{@area area B11|4f9|x}的通道内。使用绞盘升起栅栏需要3个动作，使用绞盘降低栅栏只需1个动作。作为一个动作，生物可以尝试将栅栏举过头顶，成功进行DC 20力量检定({@skill Athletics})。",
	"The upper yard is patrolled by a {@creature young red dragon} named Kalimrax. The dragon guards the fortress against aerial assault, but attacks from the air are few and far between. Kalimrax spends most of her time prowling about the harbor, idly threatening to devour any dockhands working there.": "上院由一只名为卡利姆拉克斯(Kalimrax)的{@creature young red dragon}巡逻。这条龙保卫着要塞免受空中攻击，但空中袭击很少。卡利姆拉克斯大部分时间都在港口徘徊，懒散地威胁要吞食任何在那里工作的码头工人。",
	"Kalimrax finds her task incredibly dull and looks to the hold's occasional visitors to provide some interest. The dragon interrogates newcomers, hoping to hear something other than the same tales of conquest Vrakir's armies always tell.

The dragon threatens to eat any character who fails to hold her interest.": "卡利姆拉克斯发现她的任务非常乏味，期待要塞偶尔出现的访客能带来一些趣味。这条龙会审问新来的人，希望听到不同于弗拉基尔的军队总是讲述的征服故事。一个角色如果在一次DC 15的魅力检定中成功({@skill Performance})，就能吸引卡利姆拉克斯的注意力长达1小时。这条龙威胁要吃掉任何不能引起她兴趣的角色。",
	"Kalimrax attacks any character she sees trying to enter the hold by stealth or by force, but she doesn't pursue characters into the hold's interior. If reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, Kalimrax retreats to her lair in {@area area B10|4f6|x}.": "卡利姆拉克斯（Kalimrax）会袭击任何试图通过潜行或强行进入船舱的角色，但她不会追击角色进入船舱内部。如果她的生命值降至50点或更少，卡利姆拉克斯会撤退到她在{@area area B10|4f6|x}的巢穴。",
	"The yard's four outbuildings have 2-foot-thick walls of basalt blocks and 10-foot-high ceilings roofed with slate. The smaller buildings (area B6a) are littered with ropes and loading hooks and contain stairwells that lead to the hold's main storage rooms (areas {@area B19|50b|x} and {@area B21|50f|x}). The larger buildings (area B6b) each contain a dozen cots and serve as quarters for the hold's visitors, most frequently Klax and her traders.": "院子里的四座附属建筑有由玄武岩石块垒砌而成的2英尺厚墙壁和铺着石板的10英尺高天花板。较小的建筑（区域 B6a）散落着绳索和装载钩，内部包含通往货舱主要储藏室（区域 {@area B19|50b|x} 和 {@area B21|50f|x}）的楼梯间。较大的建筑（区域 B6b）每个都有十二张床铺，作为货舱的访客住所，最常见的是克拉克斯（Klax）和她的贸易商。",
	"If the characters arrive at the hold while the traders are present, one of the larger buildings is inhabited by Klax (chaotic neutral {@creature cambion}) and eight traders ({@creature Commoner||commoners}).

Each erinyes is hostile to anyone attempting to climb the outer walls but is otherwise indifferent to the goings-on in the yards below.": "每座塔楼中都有一名{@creature erinyes}值勤，偶尔会离开塔楼，沿着相邻的帘墙走动。每个厄里尼斯对试图攀登外墙的人都持敌意，但对下方庭院中的事务却漠不关心。",
	"Two {@creature erinyes} guard access to the harbor, one in each tower. These guards are hostile to anyone attempting to enter or leave the hold via the river without {@creature Jarazoun|KftGV}'s approval. The erinyes admit Klax and her traders after a cursory inspection of their cargo, although the erinyes become suspicious if the traders aren't following their usual schedule.": "两名卫兵守护着港口，每座塔楼一名。这些卫兵对任何试图未经{@creature Jarazoun|KftGV}批准就通过河流进入或离开码头的人都持敌意。厄里尼斯在对他们的货物进行粗略检查后，允许克拉克斯和她的贸易商进入，尽管如果贸易商没有按照他们通常的时间表行事，厄里尼斯会变得怀疑起来。",
	"The efreeti's mouth is the main entrance to the hold's interior and is primarily used by Vrakir and {@creature Jarazoun|KftGV}, who can easily navigate its 20-foot elevation above the yard.

	"A chaotic neutral {@creature ogre} named Yug occupies this cell. For the past three days, Yug has been confined here for breaking a duergar's arm in anger over the theft of Gruk-Gruk, a crude rag doll.": "一个混乱中立的{@creature ogre}叫做尤格（Yug）占据了这个牢房。在过去的三天里，尤格因为愤怒地打断了一名杜尔加的手臂，因为他们偷了古克-古克（Gruk-Gruk），一个简陋的布娃娃。",
	"Three {@creature erinyes} lounge in their hammocks here, resting between shifts patrolling the walls. The erinyes are immediately suspicious of the characters, as visitors don't usually come here. Unless the characters provide a compelling reason for their intrusion and succeed on a DC 20 Charisma ({@skill Deception} or {@skill Persuasion}) check, the erinyes try to capture the characters for questioning.": "这里有三名{@creature erinyes}躺在吊床上休息，他们在轮班巡逻城墙之间休息。厄里尼斯对角色们立刻产生了怀疑，因为通常不会有访客来这里。除非角色们提供一个令人信服的入侵理由，并在一次DC 20的魅力检定({@skill Deception})或({@skill Persuasion})中成功，否则厄里尼斯会试图抓住角色们进行询问。",
	"Two {@creature duergar} are busily preparing the hold's next meal: tuber stew. They are arguing about how spicy the stew ought to be. If the duergar notice the party, they assume the characters are members of Klax's crew and start instructing them where to put the new supplies. Only if the characters ignore the cooks' instructions do the duergar become suspicious, attacking while shouting to the duergar in area B18 if the characters can't justify their presence.": "两名{@creature duergar}正忙着准备船舱的下一顿饭：块茎炖菜。他们正在争论炖菜应该有多辣。如果地底精灵注意到了队伍，他们会假设角色是克拉克斯船员，并开始指示他们把新的补给放在哪里。只有当角色们不理睬厨师的指示时，地底精灵才会产生怀疑，大声对B18区域的地底精灵喊话，如果角色们不能证明他们的存在理由，地底精灵就会发动攻击。",
	"The iron chests are unlocked. Each chest contains ten spare sets of plain, dwarf-sized clothing. One chest also holds a small black {@item pouch|PHB} containing two eight-sided obsidian dice (50 gp) and a dagger with a malachite blade (250 gp).

	"This is the fortress's primary storage area. Most of Klax's deliveries are carried here by the dockhands via the staircase from the outbuilding above ({@area area B6a|4eb|x}). The supplies primarily consist of food, water, timber, rope, and raw iron.": "这是要塞的主要储存区。大部分克拉克斯(Klax)的交付物品都是通过码头工人经由楼上的外部建筑的楼梯({@area area B6a|4eb|x})运送到这里。这些供应主要包括食物、水、木材、绳索和生铁。",
	"Two {@creature Salamander||salamanders} rest in these barracks, their bodies coiled to nestle into the depressions in the solidified lava. If the characters aren't escorted by other members of the hold, the salamanders assume the characters are a threat and attack immediately.": "这个营房里有两只{@creature Salamander||salamanders}，它们的身体盘曲着，蜷缩在凝固的熔岩凹陷中。如果角色没有其他矮人陪同，火蜥蜴会认为角色是威胁并立即发动攻击。",
	"Two {@creature Salamander||salamanders} stand guard here along with a {@creature beholder} known as the Eye of the Efreet. These creatures are hostile unless the characters arrive with an escort, in which case the characters are directed to area B23 to make an appointment to see {@creature Jarazoun|KftGV}. Once the characters proceed to {@area area B25|51b|x}, the salamanders accompany them and remain there for the duration of their visit.": "这里有两名{@creature Salamander||salamanders}守卫，以及一只被称为{@creature beholder}的伊夫利特之眼。这些生物很敌对，除非角色有护送，否则会攻击。在这种情况下，角色会被引导到B23区域，预约见{@creature Jarazoun|KftGV}。一旦角色前往{@area area B25|51b|x}，火蜥蜴会陪同他们，并在他们访问期间留在那里。",
	"Nebukath the {@creature arcanaloth} sees to the hold's administrative tasks. Nebukath is initially indifferent toward the characters and presumes they have come seeking an audience with {@creature Jarazoun|KftGV}. The arcanaloth languidly informs the characters that the efreeti is too busy to meet with them.": "内布卡斯{@creature arcanaloth}负责堡垒的行政任务。内布卡斯最初对角色们漠不关心，并假定他们是来拜访{@creature Jarazoun|KftGV}的。这位奥术恶魔慵懒地告诉角色们，伊弗利提现在太忙了，无法见他们。",
	"If Nebukath discovers the party's purpose, the arcanaloth follows them closely, waiting for the characters to steal the {@item Book of Vile Darkness (Variant)|KftGV|Book of Vile Darkness}.

	"If he hasn't been encountered and defeated elsewhere, the {@creature efreeti} {@creature Jarazoun|KftGV} sits on the throne, acting as master of Brimstone Hold in Vrakir's absence. {@creature Jarazoun|KftGV} has little patience for the business of running a stronghold and leaves most of the decision-making to Nebukath. The stronghold's denizens see {@creature Jarazoun|KftGV} for the petty tyrant he is, but they obey him out of fear of his patron, Vrakir.": "如果{@creature efreeti} {@creature Jarazoun|KftGV}在其他地方没有被遇到和打败，他就会坐在王座上，代表Vrakir缺席时担任Brimstone Hold的主人。{@creature Jarazoun|KftGV}对于管理要塞的事务没有太多耐心，大部分决策都交给了Nebukath。要塞的居民看出{@creature Jarazoun|KftGV}是个小暴君，但他们出于对他的主人Vrakir的恐惧而服从他。",
	"If the characters come before {@creature Jarazoun|KftGV} posing as visitors with legitimate business at the hold, the efreeti treats them with indifference. He enjoys lording his power over petitioners and denies any requests the characters make dismissively, relenting only if plied with substantial wealth or flattery—a very rare magic item, 10,000 gp worth of treasure, or a successful DC 25 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check suffices.": "如果角色在{@creature Jarazoun|KftGV}之前以合法商务访客的身份出现，那个伊弗利特会对他们置之不理。他喜欢在请求者身上展示自己的权力，并会傲慢地拒绝角色提出的任何请求，只有在被提供大量财富或奉承之后才会让步——一个非常罕见的魔法物品，价值10,000 gp的财宝，或者一个成功的DC 25魅力检定((Charisma))。",
	"If the characters insult {@creature Jarazoun|KftGV} or reveal their true purpose, the efreeti becomes hostile and shouts for the salamanders in {@area area B22|512|x} to apprehend the characters and imprison them in {@area area B13|4fd|x}. If the party resists, {@creature Jarazoun|KftGV} fights desperately, fearing Vrakir's wrath if the characters were to escape.": "如果角色侮辱{@creature Jarazoun|KftGV}或者透露他们真正的目的，伊弗利特会变得敌对，并大声呼喊{@area area B22|512|x}的火蜥蜴来逮捕角色并将他们关押在{@area area B13|4fd|x}中。如果队伍抵抗，{@creature Jarazoun|KftGV}会拼命战斗，害怕如果角色逃脱，维拉基尔会发怒。",
	"{@creature Jarazoun|KftGV} wears a gold chain of office studded with fire opals (5,000 gp) and eight gold rings set with precious stones (250 gp each).

	"The statues are two {@creature Stone Golem||stone golems} that are normally quiescent and don't react to the characters' presence. However, the golems are magically attuned to the door to area B29 and become hostile if a creature attempts to open the door by any means other than using Vrakir's key. A character who succeeds on their ability check to pick the lock by 10 or more avoids triggering the golems. Entering area B29 by using magic (such as the {@spell passwall} spell) to bypass the door entirely doesn't trigger the golems.": "这两座雕像是平时静止不动的{@creature Stone Golem||stone golems}，不会对角色的存在做出反应。然而，这些魔像与通往B29区域的门有魔法联系，如果有生物试图通过任何方式打开门而不使用Vrakir的钥匙，它们就会变得敌对。如果角色在尝试撬锁的能力检定中成功地比要求的值高出10点，就可以避免触发魔像。通过使用魔法（比如{@spell passwall}法术）完全绕过门进入B29区域不会触发魔像。",

	"The room's back wall appears solid but is the anchor for a magical doorway to area B30: the demiplane where Vrakir keeps the real {@item Book of Vile Darkness (Variant)|KftGV|Book of Vile Darkness}. Anyone examining the wall using {@spell detect magic} can see the outline of the door. The scorch marks and cracked masonry are due to the book's corrupting influence, which seeps out every time the doorway is opened.": "房间的后墙看起来坚固，但实际上是通往B30区域的一个魔法门的锚点：这是Vrakir保管真正{@item Book of Vile Darkness (Variant)|KftGV|Book of Vile Darkness}的半位面。任何使用{@spell detect magic}检查墙壁的人都可以看到门的轮廓。墙上的烧焦痕迹和破裂的砖石是由于这本书的腐化影响，每次打开门时都会渗出。",
	"The key to opening the door is the gemstone set in the wall carving. The gem is trapped with a 6th-level {@spell glyph of warding} spell. The glyph casts {@spell disintegrate} on any creature that touches the gem without speaking Vrakir's motto: atka ignari. While touching the gem, a creature can take an action to open the door to area B30 as if the creature had cast the {@spell demiplane} spell; this causes the face in the wall to stretch its mouth wide as a shimmering gray portal appears within. Removing the gem from the wall causes the doorway to disappear, trapping anything in area B30 in the demiplane until the gem is replaced or someone else accesses the room with a {@spell demiplane} spell.": "打开门的关键是嵌在墙雕中的宝石。这颗宝石被困在一个6级{@spell glyph of warding}法术中。符文会对触摸宝石但未说出Vrakir的座右铭：atka ignari的生物施放{@spell disintegrate}。当触摸宝石时，生物可以采取行动打开通往B30区域的门，就好像生物施放了{@spell demiplane}法术一样；这会导致墙上的脸张开嘴巴，一个闪烁的灰色传送门出现在其中。将宝石从墙上取下会导致门消失，将B30区域中的任何东西困在次元平面中，直到宝石被放回或其他人用{@spell demiplane}法术进入房间。",
	"If removed from the wall, the gem continues to radiate magic but doesn't otherwise function. It is worth 5,000 gp.": "如果从墙上移除，宝石仍然会散发魔法，但除此之外不起作用。它价值5000 gp。",
