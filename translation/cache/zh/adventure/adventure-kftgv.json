	"{@i Keys from the Golden Vault} presents thirteen Dungeons & Dragons adventures that feature heists. In each adventure, the characters receive a mission, plan the job, execute their plan, and try to escape the scene. You can run each heist as a standalone adventure or as part of a larger campaign (see \"{@area A Campaign of Heists|005|x}\" later in this introduction). Each adventure can be adapted to take place in any campaign setting you wish.": "{@i Keys from the Golden Vault}介绍了13个以抢劫为特色的龙与地下城冒险。在每个冒险中，人物都会接到一个任务，计划工作，执行计划，并试图逃离现场。你可以把每个抢劫案作为一个独立的冒险，或者作为一个更大的战役的一部分来运行（见本介绍后面的\"（1%）\"）。每一次冒险都可以改编为发生在任何你希望的战役环境中。",
	"The Heist Adventures table summarizes the adventures in this anthology. Each adventure is designed for four to six characters of a particular level and adheres to the following narrative structure:": "盗贼历险记》表总结了本文集的历险记。每个冒险都是为四到六个特定级别的角色设计的，并遵循以下叙事结构：导言）。每一次冒险都可以改编为发生在任何你希望的战役环境中。",

	"Rumored to be associated with metallic dragons, the Golden Vault is a secretive organization that has its base on one of the good-aligned Outer Planes. Its membership and activities are almost impossible for outsiders to track, but those in the know are aware that the organization rights moral wrongs, supports virtuous underdogs, and handles delicate situations local authorities won't touch. The Golden Vault's motto reflects its primary motivation: \"Do good, no matter the cost.\" Missions from the Golden Vault are often illegal, but they always support a just, moral cause.": "据传与金属龙有关，金库是一个神秘的组织，它的基地在一个与正义结盟的外部星球。它的成员和活动几乎不可能被外人追踪到，但那些知情者都知道，该组织为道德上的错误辩护，支持有德行的弱者，并处理当地政府不愿触及的棘手情况。金库的座右铭反映了其主要动机。\"做好事，不计代价\"。金库的任务往往是非法的，但它们总是支持一个公正的、道德的事业。",

An operative might be a priest, a scholar, a charity worker, a government liaison, a philanthropist, or any other upstanding local.": "金库的卧底人员监视着物质界主要城市的冒险团体。一个特工可能是牧师、学者、慈善工作者、政府联络员、慈善家，或者其他任何一个正直的地方。金库的座右铭反映了其主要动机。\"做好事，不计代价\"。金库的任务往往是非法的，但它们总是支持一个公正的、道德的事业。",
	"Once an adventuring group proves itself effective and virtuous, an operative approaches the characters to offer Golden Vault membership. Should the group accept, its members join the ranks of the Golden Vault, and the person who invited them becomes their handler for future missions. For an example of a handler, see the \"{@area Meera Raheer|009|x}\" section.": "一旦一个冒险团证明自己是有效的、有德行的，一个特工就会接近这些人物，提供黄金库的成员资格。如果该团体接受，其成员就会加入金库的行列，而邀请他们的人就会成为他们未来任务的负责人。关于联络人的例子，见\"{@area Meera Raheer|009|x} \"部分。\"做好事，不计代价\"。金库的任务往往是非法的，但它们总是支持一个公正的、道德的事业。",
	"If the characters get stuck, the Golden Vault can provide unexpected help. For instance, if the characters lack vital information needed for a heist, their handler might share a recent discovery.

	"When Meera was young, her kindhearted and upstanding mothers served as city clerks. But when they began investigating financial irregularities, the unscrupulous mayor framed them for embezzlement to cover his own corruption. The only evidence of the Raheers' innocence was a packet of letters between the mayor and his conspirators. The letters were locked in the mayor's office.": "当米拉年轻时，她善良和正直的母亲担任城市书记员。但当她们开始调查财务违规行为时，无良的市长为了掩盖自己的腐败行为而诬陷她们贪污。证明拉赫夫妇清白的唯一证据是市长和他的同谋者之间的一包信件。这些信被锁在市长的办公室里。",
	"Luckily for the Raheers, a crew of Golden Vault operatives infiltrated city hall, retrieved the letters, and revealed the mayor's crimes. The Raheers kept fighting against government corruption, and Meera has followed in her parents' footsteps, continuing their anti-corruption work by becoming a city's clerk and a member of the Golden Vault.": "幸运的是，一群金库特工潜入市政厅，取回了这些信件，并揭露了市长的罪行。拉赫夫妇继续与政府腐败作斗争，米拉也追随她父母的脚步，继续他们的反腐工作，成为一名城市的书记员和金库的一名成员。这些信被锁在市长的办公室里。",

	"Unforeseen complications are an iconic aspect of heist narratives. Whether they take the form of a rival crew appearing out of nowhere or a treasure that turns out to be fake, complications ratchet up the tension and require the characters to think on their feet.": "不可预见的复杂情况是抢劫案叙述的一个标志性方面。无论是突然出现的竞争对手，还是被证明是假的宝藏，复杂情况都会增加紧张感，并要求角色用自己的方式思考。",
	"If you want to challenge your players, consider adding one of the complications below to any of this book's adventures.": "如果你想挑战你的玩家，可以考虑在本书的任何一个冒险中加入下面的一个复杂情况。",
	"Many of this book's heists involve procuring a MacGuffin. Part of preparing for these heists is determining where the MacGuffin in question is located.": "本书中的许多抢劫案都涉及到采购MacGuffin。为这些抢劫做准备的部分工作是确定有关的MacGuffin的位置。",
	"If the characters are having too easy of a time finding the MacGuffin, consider shifting its location to another place that makes sense. Or consider revealing that the MacGuffin is a fake, and the real prize is still nearby. The characters should still be able to determine where it's really located.": "如果人物在寻找麦克格芬时太容易了，可以考虑将其位置转移到另一个有意义的地方。或者考虑透露麦克格芬是假的，而真正的奖品仍然在附近。人物应该仍然能够确定它的真正位置。",
	"For example, in \"{@adventure The Murkmire Malevolence|KftGV|1},\" perhaps the MacGuffin is no longer in the Gemstone Wing and is being stored in the museum's attic overnight. The characters could learn this detail by reading notes they discover in the curator's office or by questioning one of the museum guards.": "例如，在\"{@adventure The Murkmire Malevolence|KftGV|1} \"中，也许MacGuffin已经不在宝石翼，而是在博物馆的阁楼上存放了一夜。人物可以通过阅读他们在馆长办公室发现的笔记或询问博物馆的一个警卫来了解这个细节。",
	"If you use the moving MacGuffin complication, be careful of moving the MacGuffin more than once. Having trouble locating the object of the heist could unduly frustrate your players.": "如果你使用了移动麦克格芬的并发症，要小心移动麦克格芬超过一次。在确定抢劫对象的位置上遇到困难可能会使你的玩家感到沮丧。",
	"A rival crew vying for the same goal can increase the pressure on the characters. Regardless of your players' goal, once another crew appears, the adventure becomes a race to accomplish the objective first.": "争夺同一目标的敌对船员可以增加人物的压力。无论你的玩家的目标是什么，一旦另一个船员出现，冒险就会变成一场争先恐后地完成目标的比赛。",
	"You can add a rival crew to an adventure at any time. When you do, make it clear to the characters that they have competition. The characters might see evidence of their rivals, such as an alarm that has already been disabled or an {@condition incapacitated} guard. At some point, the characters might even catch their rivals trying to steal the adventure's MacGuffin from right under their noses!": "你可以在任何时候在冒险中加入对手的船员。当你这样做时，要让角色清楚地知道他们有竞争。角色们可能会看到对手的证据，比如一个已经被禁用的警报器或一个{@condition incapacitated}的警卫。在某些时候，角色们甚至可能抓到他们的对手试图在他们的眼皮底下偷取冒险中的麦克格芬！这时，他们就会发现，他们的对手已经在他们的眼皮底下了。",

	"Dr. Cassee Dannell, a brilliant academic, long ago learned to hide her interest in the occult. She instead built a career gaining expertise in the peoples and cultures of the region surrounding Varkenbluff, continuing her occult research in secret. By age twenty-four, Dr. Dannell had earned her doctorate in anthropology from Varkenbluff University, a prestigious institution in her home city.

	"On a recent expedition into the nearby Murkmire, the archaeologists unearthed a strange object. Light green, opaque, and with a gemstone-like sheen, this ovoid stone was covered in strange furrows. The stone seemed ritualistic in nature, but it matched no recorded historical practices, and no one could identify its composition. The more Dr. Dannell studied it, the more she became convinced this object, which the archaeologists dubbed the Murkmire Stone, was not created by any known civilization—and might be dangerous.": "在最近一次对附近的Murkmire的考察中，考古学家们发现了一个奇怪的物体。浅绿色，不透明，具有宝石般的光泽，这块卵形的石头上布满了奇怪的沟壑。这块石头似乎具有仪式感，但它与历史上记载的做法并不相符，而且没有人能够确定其成分。丹奈尔博士对它研究得越多，她就越相信这个被考古学家称为Murkmire石的物体不是由任何已知的文明创造的，而且可能是危险的。因此，在她毕业后，丹奈尔博士成为了瓦肯布洛夫的教员和野外科学家，陪同大学的考古人员在该地区进行挖掘。",

	"Dr. Dannell continued to research the strange stone. Her concern turned to dread when she found descriptions of similar objects in her occult tomes. These objects were, in fact, the eggs of eldritch creatures. She learned that such eggs lay dormant for generations, but once the eggs are unearthed, the creatures within rapidly develop and hatch. The resulting creatures are ravenous for raw meat and grow exponentially as they feed, eventually overwhelming entire villages. The eggs are nearly indestructible, but the tomes claim encasing them in crystal can neutralize them.": "Dannell博士继续研究这块奇怪的石头。当她在她的神秘学书籍中发现对类似物体的描述时，她的担忧变成了恐惧。事实上，这些物体是长生生物的卵。她了解到，这种蛋会休眠几代人，但一旦蛋被挖掘出来，里面的生物就会迅速发育和孵化。孵化出来的生物对生肉非常渴望，并在进食时成倍增长，最终压倒了整个村庄。这些蛋几乎是无坚不摧的，但文献中声称将它们包裹在水晶中可以中和它们。Rkenbluff的教员和野外科学家，陪同大学的考古人员在该地区进行挖掘。博物馆，偷蛋，并在它释放出长生不老的恐怖之前将其送还给Cassee Dannell博士，使其中和。",

The warden refuses to make the journey, however, because she can't bear to lose all contact with Vlax.

	"If the characters reveal their true purpose, Nebukath perks up and excitedly offers to aid them.

	"If the characters come before Jarazoun posing as visitors with legitimate business at the hold, the efreeti treats them with indifference. He enjoys lording his power over petitioners and denies any requests the characters make dismissively, relenting only if plied with substantial wealth or flattery—a very rare magic item, 10,000 gp worth of treasure, or a successful DC 25 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check suffices.": "如果这些人物在贾拉祖恩面前冒充有合法业务的游客，埃弗里蒂就会以冷漠的态度对待他们。他喜欢把自己的权力凌驾于请愿者之上，并轻蔑地拒绝人物提出的任何请求，只有在得到大量财富或奉承的情况下才会松口--非常稀有的魔法物品、价值10,000金币的财宝，或者成功通过DC25魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查即可。",
	"If the characters insult Jarazoun or reveal their true purpose, the efreeti becomes hostile and shouts for the salamanders in {@area area B22|512|x} to apprehend the characters and imprison them in {@area area B13|4fd|x}.

The creature must finish a long rest before it can gain this benefit again.": "贾拉祖恩在这里招待受宠的客人。红宝石般的液体是从黄铜之城进口的火酒。任何喝了这种酒的生物都会获得15个临时打击点数。该生物必须在完成一次长时间的休息后才能再次获得这一好处。",
