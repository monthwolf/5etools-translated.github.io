	"This Dungeons & Dragons adventure begins in a world of your choosing—perhaps a world of your own creation—then ventures into the Feywild. Also known as the Plane of Faerie, the Feywild is a place of wonder and whimsy ruled by unfettered emotion. Before running this adventure, please read the \"{@book Feywild|DMG|2|Feywild}\" section in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, as it contains useful information about this dusky, fantastic plane of existence.": "这个龙与地下城的冒险从你选择的世界开始--也许是你自己创造的世界--然后冒险进入精灵世界。也被称为精灵界，精灵界是一个由无拘无束的情感所统治的奇迹和奇思妙想的地方。在进行这个冒险之前，请阅读{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的\"{@book Feywild|DMG|2|Feywild} \"部分，因为它包含了关于这个昏暗的、奇妙的存在空间的有用信息。",
	"The information in this book is intended for the DM's eyes only. If you're planning to play through the adventure with someone else as your DM, stop reading now!": "本书中的信息仅用于DM的眼睛。如果你打算和别人一起玩这个冒险，那么现在就不要再看了。",
	"The main antagonists of this story are three hags who collectively form the Hourglass Coven, which is described in {@area appendix B|44e|x}. These hags are the adoptive sisters of Iggwilv, a powerful figure from D&D's past and a key player in the adventure's unfolding drama. Using an artifact called {@item Iggwilv's Cauldron|WBtW}, the hags have trapped an archfey named Zybilna in temporal stasis and carved up her fey domain among them. This domain is called Prismeer. To enter it, the characters must first visit the Witchlight Carnival, which travels across the Material Plane and appears on the characters' world once every eight years. The carnival owners are a pair of shadar-kai (elves native to the Shadowfell) named {@creature Mister Witch|WBtW} and {@creature Mister Light|WBtW}, who can help or hinder the characters' efforts to reach Prismeer.": "这个故事的主要对立面是三个女巫，她们共同组成了沙漏女巫团，在{@area appendix B|44e|x}中有所描述。这些女巫是Iggwilv的养姐妹，Iggwilv是D&D过去的一个强大人物，也是冒险故事中的一个关键人物。这些女巫使用一种叫做{@item Iggwilv's Cauldron|WBtW}的神器，将一个名叫Zybilna的大帝困在了时间静止中，并在她们中间划分出了她的精灵领域。这个领域被称为Prismeer。要进入这个领域，人物必须首先访问巫师之光狂欢节，它穿越物质世界，每八年在人物的世界出现一次。狂欢节的主人是一对名叫{@creature Mister Witch|WBtW}和{@creature Mister Light|WBtW}的Shadar-kai（原产于Shadowfell的精灵），他们可以帮助或阻碍角色到达Prismeer的努力。",
	"One of the many novelties of this adventure is that the characters can accomplish their goals without resorting to violence—but only if they're clever. They can fight their way through the adventure as well, but the odds won't always be in their favor.": "这场冒险的许多新奇之处在于，人物可以在不诉诸暴力的情况下实现他们的目标--但前提是他们要聪明。他们也可以通过冒险的方式战斗，但胜算并不总是对他们有利。",
	"The characters are drawn into the adventure by one of two adventure hooks. You choose which hook to use. Both hooks are described in \"{@area Beginning the Adventure|045|x},\" later in this introduction.": "角色被两个冒险钩中的一个吸引到冒险中。你可以选择使用哪个钩子。这两个钩子都在本介绍后面的\"{@area Beginning the Adventure|045|x} \"中描述。",
	"{@adventure Chapters 2|WBtW|2}, {@adventure 3|WBtW|3}, and {@adventure 4|WBtW|4} describe the carved-up domain of Prismeer, which the hags of the Hourglass Coven have usurped and split into thirds. The characters can move between these splinter-realms only if they have the right fey guides to help them.": "{@adventure Chapters 2|WBtW|2}、{@adventure 3|WBtW|3}和{@adventure 4|WBtW|4}描述的是普利斯梅尔的刻板领域，沙漏巫师团的巫师们篡夺了这个领域，并将其分成了三部分。只有在有合适的精灵向导帮助他们的情况下，人物才能在这些分裂的领域之间移动。",
	"{@adventure Chapter 5|WBtW|5} describes the Palace of Heart's Desire, where the archfey Zybilna and her court are frozen in time by the magic of {@item Iggwilv's Cauldron|WBtW}. The palace is where the characters need to go if they hope to thwart the Hourglass Coven by freeing Zybilna or destroying the cauldron.": "{@adventure Chapter 5|WBtW|5}描述了心愿之宫，大王Zybilna和她的宫廷被{@item Iggwilv's Cauldron|WBtW}的魔法冻结在那里。如果他们希望通过解救Zybilna或摧毁大锅来挫败沙漏女巫团，那么这座宫殿就是他们需要去的地方。",
	"The book concludes with several appendices wherein you'll find rules for new magic items, stat blocks for new creatures, and other goodies. At the end of the book is a {@adventure Story Tracker|WBtW|11} you can use to keep track of story developments as they occur. Advice on how to use the Story Tracker appears later in this introduction.": "本书最后有几个附录，其中你会发现新的魔法物品的规则，新生物的状态块，以及其他一些好东西。在书的末尾有一个{@adventure Story Tracker|WBtW|11}，你可以用它来跟踪故事的发展，因为它们发生了。关于如何使用故事追踪器的建议将在本介绍的后面出现。",
	"The adventure assumes that the characters start at 1st level. If your players are more interested in exploration and social interaction than combat, or if you want to make the characters' Feywild excursion less dangerous, have them start at 3rd level instead. Advancement is handled the same way regardless.": "这个冒险假定角色从1级开始。如果你的玩家对探索和社会交往比战斗更感兴趣，或者如果你想让角色的Feywild之旅不那么危险，可以让他们从3级开始。无论如何，进阶的方式都是一样的。",
	"In this adventure, the characters receive experience points for achieving milestones rather than defeating monsters:": "在这次冒险中，人物因实现里程碑而获得经验值，而不是打败怪物。",
	"Whenever the characters enter a hag's realm (Hither, Thither, or Yon) for the first time, everyone in the party receives enough XP to advance 1 level. For example, when the characters leave the Witchlight Carnival and arrive in Hither for the first time, they gain a level.": "每当人物第一次进入巫师的领域（Hither, Thither, or Yon），队伍中的每个人都会得到足够的XP来提升1级。例如，当人物离开巫师之光狂欢节并首次到达Hither时，他们会获得一个等级。",
	"After the characters encounter a hag of the Hourglass Coven for the first time, everyone in the party who survives the encounter receives enough XP to advance 1 level.": "在人物第一次遇到沙漏女巫后，党内每个人只要在这次遭遇中幸存下来，就能得到足够的XP值来提升1级。",
	"If the characters free Zybilna from temporal stasis or destroy {@item Iggwilv's Cauldron|WBtW}, everyone in the party receives enough XP to advance 1 level.": "如果人物将Zybilna从时空停滞中解救出来或摧毁{@item Iggwilv's Cauldron|WBtW}，党内的每个人都会得到足够的XP来提升1级。",
	"If you follow this method of character advancement, characters who start the adventure at 1st level might reach 8th level by the adventure's conclusion.": "如果你按照这种方法进行角色升级，从1级开始冒险的角色在冒险结束时可能达到8级。",
	"Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.": "出现在这样的方框中的文字是为了让玩家在他们的角色第一次到达某个地点或在某个特定情况下大声朗读或转述，如文中所述。",
	"This book contains a fold-out, double-sided poster map and several interior maps. These elements are further described in the sections that follow.": "本书包含一张折叠式双面海报地图和几张内部地图。这些内容将在后面的章节中进一步描述。",
	"The adventure lets you know when it's safe to show your players either side of the double-sided poster map.": "冒险让你知道什么时候可以向你的玩家展示双面海报地图的任何一面，这是很安全的。",
	"One side of the poster map shows the Witchlight Carnival and a Time Tracker, to help you track the passage of time as the characters explore the carnival. Certain carnival events occur only when the Time Tracker reaches a certain point. Though it's not necessary, your group can place tokens or miniatures on the map to keep track of where the characters are in the carnival at any given time.": "海报地图的一面显示了巫师之光狂欢节和一个时间追踪器，以帮助你在人物探索狂欢节的过程中追踪时间的推移。只有当时间追踪器达到某个点时，某些狂欢节事件才会发生。虽然没有必要，但你的小组可以在地图上放置令牌或小模型，以追踪角色在任何特定时间内在嘉年华会的位置。",
	"The reverse side of the poster map shows the Feywild domain of Prismeer, now divided into three splinter-realms called Hither, Thither, and Yon. Lodged between them is the Palace of Heart's Desire—the home of Prismeer's archfey ruler, Zybilna. This side of the map is meant to be shared with the players once the characters reach the palace, from where they can look out over the whole domain. DM-friendly versions of this map appear in {@adventure chapters 2|WBtW|2|Hither}, {@adventure 3|WBtW|3|Thither}, and {@adventure 4|WBtW|4|Yon}, to help you track the party's progress through Prismeer's splinter-realms.": "海报地图的反面显示了Prismeer的Feywild领域，现在分为三个分裂的王国，分别称为Hither、Thither和Yon。位于它们之间的是 \"心愿之宫\"--Prismeer的大帝统治者Zybilna的家。地图的这一面是为了在角色到达宫殿后与玩家分享的，在那里他们可以俯瞰整个领域。该地图的DM友好版本出现在{@adventure chapters 2|WBtW|2|Hither}、{@adventure 3|WBtW|3|Thither}和{@adventure 4|WBtW|4|Yon}中，以帮助你追踪党派在普利斯米尔分裂领域的进展。",
	"The number eight is symbolically important, as this adventure plays with the themes of time and nostalgia. The numeral 8 resembles an hourglass, which measures the passage of time, and looks like the symbol for infinity (∞) turned on its side. Hidden within the numeral 8 itself is the numeral 3. In the D&D multiverse, there exists the Rule of Three, which states that events of cosmic consequence often manifest in threes. Time, for instance, has a past, present, and future. The Hourglass Coven has three members. The fey domain of Prismeer is divided into three splinter-realms, which adventurers explore with the help of three guides.": "数字8具有重要的象征意义，因为这次冒险玩的是时间和怀旧的主题。数字8类似于一个沙漏，用来测量时间的流逝，看起来就像无限的符号（∞）被翻转过来。数字8本身隐藏着数字3。在D&D多元宇宙中，存在着 \"三法则\"，即具有宇宙性影响的事件往往以三的形式出现。例如，时间有过去、现在和未来。沙漏女巫团有三个成员。普利斯梅尔（Prismeer）的精灵领域被划分为三个不同的领域，冒险者在三个向导的帮助下探索这些领域。",
	"Hidden within the adventure are numerous other mentions of the numbers eight and three. Can you find them all?": "在这个冒险中还隐藏着许多其他提到的数字8和3。你能把它们都找出来吗？",
	"Maps that appear in this book are for your eyes only. As the characters explore locations on a given map, you can redraw portions of the map on graph paper, a wet-erase mat, or another surface to help your players visualize locations that might have unusual shapes or features. Your hand-drawn maps need not be faithful to the originals, and you can alter a map's features as you see fit. Nor do your maps need to be painstakingly rendered. You can omit details that are not readily visible (such as secret doors and other hidden features) until the characters are able to detect and interact with them.": "本书中出现的地图仅供您参考。当人物探索某张地图上的地点时，你可以在图画纸、湿擦笔垫或其他表面上重新绘制地图的部分内容，以帮助玩家直观地看到可能有不寻常形状或特征的地点。你的手绘地图不需要忠实于原作，你可以根据你的需要改变地图的特征。你的地图也不需要刻意渲染。你可以省略那些不容易看到的细节（如暗门和其他隐藏的特征），直到人物能够发现并与之互动。",
	"An arrow on a slope or staircase always points in the ascending direction.": "斜坡或楼梯上的箭头总是指向上升的方向。",
	"The poster map of Prismeer and the interior maps of Hither, Thither, and Yon show important landmarks that are described in the text. These landmarks are not drawn to scale.": "Prismeer的海报地图和Hither, Thither, and Yon的内部地图显示了文本中描述的重要地标。这些地标没有按比例绘制。",
	"At various times in the adventure, you will be advised to jot down information on the Story Tracker, as events that happen in earlier chapters can give characters an advantage in later chapters. The Story Tracker also allows you to record important details. For example, if a character falls under a curse, noting the specifics of the curse on the Story Tracker might remind you of the effect.": "在冒险的不同时期，你会被建议在故事追踪器上记下信息，因为在早期章节发生的事件可以使角色在后面的章节中获得优势。故事追踪器还允许你记录重要的细节。例如，如果一个角色受到了诅咒，在故事追踪器上记下诅咒的具体内容可能会提醒你注意其效果。",
	"A lost unicorn horn plays an important part in the adventure. Its location is determined randomly by rolling on the Unicorn Horn's Location table. Once you determine where the horn is, record its location on the {@adventure Story Tracker|WBtW|11}.": "一个丢失的独角兽角在冒险中起着重要作用。它的位置是通过在独角兽角的位置表上滚动随机确定的。一旦你确定了角的位置，就在{@adventure Story Tracker|WBtW|11}上记录它的位置。",
	"The horn belongs to a unicorn named Elidon, who was captured and transformed into a rocking horse by the Hourglass Coven. For more information about Elidon, see {@area area L6|24f|x} in {@adventure chapter 3|WBtW|3}.": "这只角属于一只名叫埃利顿的独角兽，它被沙漏女巫会抓住并变成了一匹摇摆马。关于埃利顿的更多信息，请参见{@adventure chapter 3|WBtW|3}中的{@area area L6|24f|x}。",
	"Offered for sale at Trinket, Bauble, and Charm's in Downfall (see {@adventure area D10|WBtW|3|D10.

	"Most of this book is for the DM's eyes only, since it's full of secrets that your players won't discover until you run the adventure for them. That said, the adventure contains a lot of information that can be shared with the players at specific times, as discussed below.": "这本书的大部分内容都是给管理员看的，因为它充满了秘密，你的玩家在你为他们进行冒险之前不会发现这些秘密。也就是说，这个冒险包含了很多可以在特定时间与玩家分享的信息，如下文所述。",
	"During character creation, you can allow your players to read the new backgrounds and race options that appear in this introduction, if you're comfortable with allowing these options in your game.": "在创建角色的过程中，你可以让你的玩家阅读本介绍中出现的新背景和种族选项，如果你愿意在游戏中允许这些选项的话。",
	"When the characters acquire a new magic item and figure out what it does (see \"{@book Identifying a Magic Item|DMG|7|Identifying a Magic Item}\" in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}), give that item's description to the players.": "当人物获得一个新的魔法物品并弄清楚它的作用时（见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的\"{@book Identifying a Magic Item|DMG|7|Identifying a Magic Item}\"），将该物品的描述给玩家。",
	"Creature stat blocks should be kept hidden from the players until circumstances warrant otherwise, as discussed below.": "生物状态块应该对玩家隐藏起来，除非情况需要，如下文所述。",
	"When characters make attacks against a creature, you compare those attacks to the creature's Armor Class to determine whether the attacks hit. After a certain number of hits and misses, players can usually pinpoint a creature's AC on their own. However, in the interest of speeding up combat, you can divulge a creature's AC once the characters have hit the creature at least once, allowing players to know without asking if attacks made against the creature hit or miss.": "当角色对生物进行攻击时，你将这些攻击与生物的护甲等级进行比较，以确定攻击是否击中。在经过一定数量的命中和未命中之后，玩家通常可以自己确定一个生物的护甲等级。然而，为了加快战斗速度，一旦角色至少击中生物一次，你就可以透露该生物的AC，让玩家不用问就能知道对该生物的攻击是否击中。",
	"It's better not to tell players how many hit points a creature has. However, you can give the players a sense of how well they're doing against the creature by describing, in narrative terms, how hurt the creature is. For example, if the creature has fewer than half its hit points remaining, you can describe it as being badly wounded or on the ropes. Such information gives the players a sense of accomplishment and might spur them to press the attack. On the other hand, if the characters aren't putting much of a dent in the creature's hit points, either because it has a lot of them or it has a trait such as Regeneration, it's a good idea to let the players know that the creature looks like it can take a lot more punishment. That information alone might encourage the players to consider a change of plan, such as a tactical retreat.": "最好不要告诉玩家一个生物有多少击打点。然而，你可以用叙述的方式让玩家感觉到他们对这个生物的表现如何。例如，如果该生物剩下的命中率不到一半，你就可以把它描述成受了重伤或濒临死亡。这样的信息给了玩家一种成就感，可能会刺激他们加强攻击。另一方面，如果角色们没有给生物的命中率带来多大的影响，要么是因为它的命中率很高，要么是因为它有再生这样的特性，那么让玩家知道这个生物看起来可以承受更多的惩罚是一个好主意。仅仅是这一信息就可以鼓励玩家考虑改变计划，比如进行战术撤退。",
	"Players need you to tell them how much damage their characters take and what type of damage it is. Whenever the adventure presents damage that is variable, it shows the average damage first, followed by a die expression in parentheses, like this: 10 ({@dice 3d6}). You decide whether to use the average or roll the dice. Using average damage speeds up play, but it might feel less exciting, and players can take advantage of its predictability. Rolling the dice takes more time but can yield more volatile results. In the interest of fairness, commit to one approach or the other for the duration of an encounter or game session.": "玩家需要你告诉他们，他们的角色受到多少伤害，是什么类型的伤害。每当冒险中出现的伤害是可变的，它首先显示的是平均伤害，然后是括号中的死亡表达式，像这样。10 ({@dice 3d6}). 你决定是使用平均数还是掷骰子。使用平均伤害可以加快游戏速度，但可能感觉不那么刺激，而且玩家可以利用其可预测性。掷骰子需要更多的时间，但可以产生更不稳定的结果。为了公平起见，在一场遭遇战或游戏环节中，应致力于使用一种方法。",
	"As their characters fight a creature, players expect to learn more about the creature's strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. It's okay to share such information with them as it becomes apparent. For example, you can describe a creature's wounds closing up when it regenerates.": "当他们的角色与生物战斗时，玩家希望了解更多关于该生物的力量、弱点和能力。当这些信息变得明显时，与他们分享这些信息是可以的。例如，你可以描述一个生物在再生时的伤口会闭合。",
	"Don't be afraid to dole out information to characters who have the applicable knowledge. If you're not sure whether the characters possess such knowledge, have them make an Intelligence check (see the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} for more guidance about {@book ability checks|DMG|8|Ability Checks}), and share the information if one or more characters succeed on the check.": "不要害怕向拥有相关知识的角色提供信息。如果你不确定这些角色是否拥有这些知识，可以让他们进行智力检查（参见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中关于{@book ability checks|DMG|8|Ability Checks}的更多指导），如果一个或多个角色检查成功，就可以分享这些信息。",
	"Many DMs like to roll their dice in the open, for all the players to see, to maintain transparency. Other DMs prefer to roll dice behind a screen to maintain suspense. Either approach is fine.": "许多管理员喜欢在公开场合掷骰子，让所有的玩家都看到，以保持透明度。其他DM喜欢在屏幕后面掷骰子以保持悬念。两种方法都可以。",
	"Even DMs who conceal their dice rolls might divulge certain results. For example, when a creature scores a critical hit against a character, it's customary to let the player know that their character just took a particularly nasty hit before revealing how much damage was dealt.": "即使是隐瞒骰子结果的管理员也可能泄露某些结果。例如，当一个生物对一个角色造成关键打击时，通常会让玩家知道他们的角色刚刚受到了特别严重的打击，然后再透露造成了多少伤害。",
	"It's okay to ask one of your players to make a die roll for you. For example, if you plan to use one of this adventure's random encounters, you can have a player roll to determine what the characters encounter, rather than making the roll yourself.": "让你的一个玩家为你掷骰子是可以的。例如，如果你打算使用这个冒险中的一个随机遭遇，你可以让一个玩家掷骰子来决定角色遇到什么，而不是自己掷骰子。",
	"Important information that doesn't appear in boxed text is usually communicated to players through roleplaying. As the DM, you roleplay all the creatures that the characters encounter in the adventure. Many of the DM-controlled creatures (also called nonplayer characters, or NPCs) in this adventure know information that the characters can learn through inquiry. The adventure outlines the most likely circumstances under which a creature will share what it knows.": "没有出现在方框内的重要信息通常是通过角色扮演传达给玩家的。作为DM，你要对角色在冒险中遇到的所有生物进行角色扮演。在这个冒险中，许多由DM控制的生物（也叫非玩家角色，或NPC）知道的信息，角色可以通过询问了解。冒险中概述了最有可能的情况，在这种情况下，生物会分享它所知道的东西。",
	"Dungeon Masters are fallible, just like everyone else, and even the most experienced DMs make mistakes. If you overlook, forget, or misrepresent something, correct yourself and move on. This is a big adventure with lots of interconnecting elements; no one expects you to internalize or memorize every aspect of it. As long as your players are having fun, everything will be just fine.": "地下城管理员是易变的，就像其他人一样，而且即使是最有经验的管理员也会犯错。如果你忽略了什么，忘记了什么，或者错误地描述了什么，请纠正自己并继续前进。这是一个有很多相互联系的元素的大冒险；没有人期望你把它的每个方面都内化或记住。只要你的玩家玩得开心，一切都会好起来的。",
	"The {@item Feywild Trinket|WBtW|Feywild Trinkets} table that follows offers a selection of trinkets appropriate for Feywild-themed adventures such as this one. Players whose characters have the {@background feylost|WBtW} or {@background Witchlight hand|WBtW} background can roll on this table instead of the {@book Trinkets|PHB|5|Trinkets} table in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} to determine what trinkets their characters possess.

Although he has been out of touch with Zybilna for almost a year, he knows that time passes differently in parts of the Feywild, including Zybilna's realm of Prismeer. He can't predict how much time it will take for the characters to complete their quest; they might come back in a matter of days, or years could pass on the Material Plane before they return.

	"After trading their sinister carnival for a more lighthearted one, the two shadar-kai took the names Witch and Light. Gradually, these morose, emotionally stunted shadar-kai transformed into fun-loving free spirits who secretly dread the day when the two carnivals cross paths again. They have no desire to return to their gloomy old carnival, which is described in more detail in {@book Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft|VRGR}.": "在用阴险的狂欢节换取更轻松的狂欢节后，这两个沙达凯取名为巫婆和光。渐渐地，这些情绪低落、情感迟钝的Shadar-kai变成了爱玩的自由精神，他们暗自害怕有一天两个嘉年华会再次相交。他们不愿意回到他们阴郁的旧狂欢节，这在{@book Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft|VRGR}中有更详细的描述。",
	"The shadar-kai are aware that the Hourglass Coven has usurped Zybilna's domain in the Feywild. They don't know how the coven accomplished this coup, but Witch and Light would like nothing more than to see the hags defeated and Zybilna returned to power. But they dare not play a part in making that dream a reality. If the coven caught a whiff of dissent from Witch and Light, the hags would punish the shadar-kai for their impudence (see the \"Witch and Light's Hourglass Pact\" sidebar). Witch and Light do what they can to appease the hags while secretly rooting for Zybilna's return. They know Zybilna's true identity but dare not reveal it.": "shadar-kai知道沙漏女巫团已经篡夺了Zybilna在Feywild的领地。他们不知道女巫会是如何完成这次政变的，但女巫和光明最希望看到的是女巫被打败，Zybilna重获权力。但他们不敢在实现这一梦想的过程中扮演任何角色。如果女巫和光的异见被女巫和光发现，女巫们会因为他们的厚颜无耻而惩罚沙达凯（见 \"女巫和光的沙漏契约 \"边栏）。巫婆和光明尽其所能安抚女巫，同时暗中支持Zybilna的回归。他们知道Zybilna的真实身份，但不敢透露。",

	"Witch, who used to go by the name Naeryx Krumple, spent his youth as a homeless orphan, eking out a meager and dreary existence on the fog-shrouded streets of Gloomwrought, a city in the Shadowfell. He earned a few coppers selling broadsheets as a young boy, then later swept floors until an old clock tower keeper took him on as a helper. The tower's clock was in such poor condition that it would break down often. Naeryx helped with the repairs and found that the work gave him a sliver of joy. When the old keeper died years later, Naeryx replaced him.": "巫师，曾用名Naeryx Krumple，年轻时是个无家可归的孤儿，在阴影地带的城市Gloomwrought的雾气笼罩的街道上过着微薄而沉闷的生活。他小时候卖大字报赚了几个铜板，后来又扫地，直到一个老钟楼看守人收留他做帮手。塔里的钟状况很差，经常会坏掉。Naeryx帮助修理，发现这项工作给他带来了一丝快乐。几年后，老看守人去世，Naeryx取代了他。",
	"The wealthy family that owned the clock tower didn't pay Naeryx a lot of money for his work, but they occasionally had him over for dinner. He owned one fine suit that he wore on such occasions, and though he didn't care for the family's matriarch or patriarch, he enjoyed the company of their eldest son, Urmius Umbrage—a brooding shadar-kai ne'er-do-well with a cruel sense of humor. Naeryx and Urmius were close in age and got along well in all respects. Years later, without informing the rest of his family, Urmius bought a run-down carnival and persuaded Naeryx to help him operate it. Naeryx and Urmius—now calling themselves {@creature Mister Witch|WBtW} and {@creature Mister Light|WBtW}—have been partners and collaborators ever since.": "拥有钟楼的富裕家庭并没有因为他的工作而付给Naeryx很多钱，但他们偶尔会请他来吃饭。他拥有一套精美的西装，在这样的场合穿，虽然他不关心这个家庭的族长或家长，但他喜欢他们的长子Urmius Umbrag--一个忧郁的Shadar-kai ne'er-do-well，具有残酷的幽默感。Naeryx和Urmius年龄相仿，在各方面都相处得很好。几年后，在没有通知家人的情况下，Urmius买下了一个破旧的狂欢节，并说服Naeryx帮助他经营。Naeryx和Urmius--现在称自己为{@creature Mister Witch|WBtW}和{@creature Mister Light|WBtW}--从那时起一直是伙伴和合作者。",
	"Light, formerly known as Urmius Umbrage, belonged to a filthy rich shadar-kai family that haunted a crumbling mansion in Gloomwrought. Although he wanted for nothing as a child, Urmius found himself surrounded by family members, caretakers, and teachers who were uniformly cold, callous, and mean-spirited. He grew tired of being seen as nothing more than the inheritor of the Umbrage estate and legacy, and he did everything in his power to make life miserable for everyone around him, especially his parents. He seemed bereft of ambition and spent much of his time playing in his room. He collected costumes and liked nothing more than to parade around Umbrage Mansion in strange garments and outlandish makeup.": "光，原名Urmius Umbrage，属于一个肮脏富有的Shadar-kai家族，在Gloomwrought的一座破败的豪宅里出没。虽然他从小就一无所求，但乌尔米乌斯发现自己身边的家庭成员、看护人和老师都是一致的冷漠、无情和刻薄。他渐渐厌倦了被看作是安布雷格财产和遗产的继承人，他尽其所能地使他周围的人，特别是他的父母生活得很痛苦。他似乎没有野心，大部分时间都在自己的房间里玩。他收集服装，只喜欢穿着奇怪的衣服，化着怪异的妆，在安柏拉格大厦周围游行。",
	"Urmius first met Naeryx Krumple at a family dinner and didn't think much of the clock tower keeper at first. But Urmius found himself taken aback by Naeryx's ability to find even a small amount of joy in his work. He was eager to get to know Naeryx better, though it took a while for Naeryx to trust him. After getting his hands on some money, Urmius bought a sad little carnival that was camped on the outskirts of Gloomwrought and asked Naeryx to help him run it. For Urmius, the carnival was a chance to emerge from under his family's shadow and become the master of his own fate, but it also meant forsaking his inheritance in order to embrace the unconventional lifestyle, fashions, and friendships he desired.": "乌尔米乌斯在一次家庭晚宴上第一次见到奈瑞克斯-克鲁普尔，起初对这个钟楼看守人没有什么想法。但Urmius发现自己被Naeryx在工作中找到哪怕一点点快乐的能力吓了一跳。他渴望更好地了解Naeryx，尽管Naeryx花了一些时间来信任他。在拿到一些钱后，乌尔米乌斯买下了一个在格洛姆沃特郊区扎营的悲惨的小嘉年华，并请纳瑞克斯帮助他经营。对乌尔米乌斯来说，嘉年华会是一个机会，让他从家庭的阴影下走出来，成为自己命运的主人，但这也意味着放弃了他的遗产，以接受他所期望的非传统的生活方式、时尚和友谊。",
	"{@creature Mister Light|WBtW} has a slender frame. He is always dressed in some sort of costume and is rarely seen in public without makeup. He carries around a fancy weather vane given to him by the carnival's previous owner. He twirls it and waves it around like a fool's scepter, but its power is far greater than he lets on. With this magic vane, he can affect the mood of everyone in the Witchlight Carnival.": "{@creature Mister Light|WBtW}有一个纤细的框架。他总是穿着某种服装，很少在公众场合看到他不化妆。他随身带着一个花哨的风向标，是嘉年华会的前主人送给他的。他旋转着它，像傻瓜的权杖一样挥舞着，但它的力量远比他说的要大。有了这个神奇的风向标，他可以影响巫师之光狂欢节中所有人的情绪。",

	"As the night progresses, Tumblestrum can reappear to provide hints about what the group needs to do; she can even guide the characters to Prismeer if all of their plans fall through (see \"Tumblestrum's Intervention\" in the \"{@area Timed Events|0eb|x}\" section later in the chapter). If she is threatened, she disappears in a flashy yet harmless pyrotechnic display. No stat block for Tumblestrum is necessary, since she won't harm or hinder the characters and can't be seriously harmed by them. Her thoughts are likewise hidden, since no magic can read them.": "随着夜幕的降临，Tumblestrum可以再次出现，为他们提供有关需要做什么的提示；如果他们的计划都失败了，她甚至可以引导他们去找Prismeer（见本章后面\"{@area Timed Events|0eb|x} \"部分的 \"Tumblestrum的干预\"）。如果她受到威胁，她会在一个华丽但无害的烟火表演中消失。没有必要为Tumblestrum设置状态块，因为她不会伤害或阻碍人物，也不会被他们严重伤害。她的思想也同样被隐藏起来，因为没有魔法可以读取它们。",
	"Tumblestrum is meant to be an enigma to the player characters. In truth, she is a savvy planar traveler who has visited and entertained folks on countless worlds. In some corners of the multiverse, she is what's known as a Planeswalker—a fiercely independent and extremely powerful entity not to be trifled with. Tumblestrum disapproves of the Hourglass Coven's cruelty and aims to deliver some much-needed comeuppance. The gnome sees the characters as agents of change who can undo some of the damage caused by the coven, and she suspects that if they do so, the characters will be on their way to becoming heroes worthy of epic ballads.": "Tumblestrum对于玩家角色来说是个谜。事实上，她是一个精明的星球旅行者，曾经访问过无数个世界，并为人们提供娱乐。在多元宇宙的某些角落，她是所谓的 \"行者\"（Planeswalker）--一个激烈的、独立的、极其强大的实体，不容小觑。Tumblestrum不赞成沙漏女巫团的残忍行为，并旨在提供一些亟需的惩罚。地精认为这些人物是变革的推动者，他们可以消除女巫团造成的一些损害，她怀疑如果他们这样做了，这些人物就会成为配得上史诗民谣的英雄。",

	"Here's a fantastic opportunity for you to explore your hidden talents as a mime.

	"Following the characters' meeting with Witch and Light, Burly pulls the characters aside for a hushed conversation:": "在人物与女巫和光的会面之后，伯力把人物拉到一边进行了一次安静的谈话。",
	"Burly removes his jack-o'-lantern helmet, revealing a worried expression. \"Bad things have been happening at the carnival for a while. People and things have been going missing. My bosses know more than they're telling, but their hands are tied somehow. You're the first people I've met who might be able to set things right. Witch and Light are good guys, but you'll need leverage to make them spill the beans.\"": "伯利摘下了他的千斤顶头盔，露出了担忧的表情。\"嘉年华会发生坏事已经有一段时间了。人和物一直在失踪。我的老板们知道的比他们说的要多，但他们的手不知为何被绑住了。你们是我遇到的第一个可能能够纠正事情的人。巫师和光是好人，但你需要杠杆作用来使他们吐露心声。\"",
	"Burly suggests the characters purloin {@creature Mister Witch|WBtW}'s {@item Witchlight watch|WBtW} (without which the carnival can't stay on schedule) and use it to compel Witch and Light to provide the answers they seek. He proposes that the best time to swipe the watch is during the Big Top Extravaganza, since it's the only time when Witch and Light are separated. Although he doesn't condone theft, Burly has talked himself into believing that it's not really stealing if the characters give back the watch. Burly offers to assist where he can, but he doesn't want Witch and Light to know that he plotted against them, because it would cost him his job and his home. He also warns that he'll see no harm come to his bosses; they might be flawed, but without them, the carnival will fall apart.": "伯利建议这些人物偷取{@creature Mister Witch|WBtW}的{@item Witchlight watch|WBtW}（没有它，狂欢节就不能按计划进行），并利用它来迫使女巫和光明提供他们所寻求的答案。他提议，盗取手表的最佳时间是在大顶棚盛会期间，因为这是唯一一个女巫和光明分开的时间。虽然他并不宽恕偷窃行为，但Burly已经说服自己相信，如果角色们把手表还给他们，那就不是真正的偷窃。伯利表示愿意提供力所能及的帮助，但他不想让女巫和光明知道他谋害了他们，因为这将使他失去工作和家。他还警告说，他不会看到他的老板受到伤害；他们可能有缺陷，但没有他们，狂欢节就会崩溃。",
	"Over the course of the conversation, Burly shares the following additional pieces of information:": "在谈话过程中，伯力分享了以下额外信息。",
	"\"The Witchlight Monarch is chosen by {@creature Mister Light|WBtW}'s {@item Witchlight vane|WBtW}. Witch and Light have no control over who the monarch will be, but it's always the guest who has contributed the most to the happiness of the carnival. The monarch is also given a charm that lets them fly.\"": "\"巫光君主是由{@creature Mister Light|WBtW}的{@item Witchlight vane|WBtW}选择的。巫师和光无法控制谁将成为君主，但总是对嘉年华会的幸福贡献最大的客人。君主还被赋予一个让他们飞翔的符咒。\"",
	"\"{@creature Mister Witch|WBtW}'s {@item Witchlight watch|WBtW} is attached to his waistcoat by a chain, so whoever tries to steal it needs something to break or unfasten the chain.\"": "\"{@creature Mister Witch|WBtW}的{@item Witchlight watch|WBtW}是用一条链子拴在他的马甲上的，所以无论谁想偷它都需要有东西来打破或解开链子。\"",
	"\"Dirlagraun, Candlefoot, and Palasha might help you—they're good eggs. But stay away from Thaco—he's untrustworthy.\"": "\"Dirlagraun、Candlefoot和Palasha可能会帮助你--他们是好蛋。但要远离塔科，他不值得信任。\"",
	"If the characters suggest stealing the {@item Witchlight vane|WBtW} instead of the {@item Witchlight watch|WBtW}, Burly asserts that the watch is easier to steal because it's smaller and often tucked in {@creature Mister Witch|WBtW}'s pocket, whereas {@creature Mister Light|WBtW} is rarely seen without the vane in hand. Burly concedes, however, that the vane yields almost as much leverage in negotiations with Witch and Light, though he has no plan for stealing the vane.": "如果角色们建议偷{@item Witchlight vane|WBtW}而不是{@item Witchlight watch|WBtW}，Burly断言，手表更容易被偷，因为它更小，而且经常被塞在{@creature Mister Witch|WBtW}的口袋里，而{@creature Mister Light|WBtW}很少看到没有风向标在手。然而，Burly承认，在与女巫和光明的谈判中，风向标几乎可以产生同样多的筹码，尽管他没有计划去偷风向标。",
	"See \"{@area Timed Events|0eb|x}\" later in the chapter for details of the coronation. It's up to the characters to come up with a plan to get close enough to {@creature Mister Witch|WBtW} to steal his pocket watch.

	"If the characters rob {@creature Mister Witch|WBtW} of his timepiece, he and Light are desperate to get it back. They'd prefer not to cause a scene in front of the guests and promise to show the characters the way to Prismeer once the watch is returned. Witch and Light are true to their word (see \"{@area Through the Looking Glass|0f8|x}\" at the end of the chapter).": "如果角色们抢走了{@creature Mister Witch|WBtW}他的计时器，他和光就会急切地想把它拿回来。他们不希望在客人面前闹事，并承诺一旦手表被归还，就会给角色们指明去Prismeer的路。巫师和光忠实于他们的承诺（见本章末尾的\"{@area Through the Looking Glass|0f8|x}\"）。",
	"{@creature Kettlesteam the Kenku|WBtW|Kettlesteam} (see the accompanying stat block) snoops around the carnival under the cover of a {@spell disguise self} spell, looking to cause trouble.

	"If Kettlesteam has not already been caught, a character who spends 1 hour searching for the disguised kenku can, with a successful DC 13 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check, see through her disguise while moving through crowds and paying close attention to suspicious-looking folks. If discovered, Kettlesteam tries to flee from the main thoroughfare, using tents and other carnival features to break line of sight to her. She's willing to cautiously parley with characters who claim they are investigating the carnival for their own reasons.": "如果Kettlesteam还没有被抓住，一个花了1个小时寻找这个伪装的Kenku的人物，只要成功通过DC13智力({@skill Investigation})检查，就能看穿她的伪装，同时在人群中穿梭，并密切注意那些看起来可疑的人。如果被发现，Kettlesteam会试图从主干道上逃走，利用帐篷和其他狂欢节的特征来打破对她的视线。她愿意谨慎地与那些声称出于自己的原因调查狂欢节的人物进行谈判。",

	"Many years ago, she made a fey pact with Zybilna, the archfey who rules the Feywild domain of Prismeer. Recently, Kettlesteam has become convinced something is amiss with her patron. As a warlock, she senses that Zybilna is no longer in touch with her—a very disconcerting thought!": "许多年前，她与Zybilna签订了一个精灵契约，Zybilna是统治Prismeer的精灵领域的大帝。最近，Kettlesteam确信她的守护者有些不对劲。作为一个术士，她感觉到Zybilna不再与她联系了--这是一个非常令人不安的想法",
	"Kettlesteam wants to question the carnival's owners about Prismeer, but they keep giving her the cold shoulder. She's sure they know more than they're letting on.": "Kettlesteam想向嘉年华会的主人询问Prismeer的情况，但他们一直对她冷眼相待。她确信他们知道的比他们透露的要多。",
	"During her last visit, Kettlesteam overheard Witch and Light talking in their wagon. She repeats the conversation, using her Mimicry trait to imitate Light's agitated voice (\"Someone is going to find out about this! They'll shut us down!\") followed by Witch's calm yet firm reply (\"We agreed to this pact. Our hands were forced but our eyes were open. We let the Hourglass Coven take what it wants, and in return, we stay in business. That is what you want, right?\").": "在她的最后一次访问中，Kettlesteam无意中听到了女巫和光在他们的马车上的谈话。她重复了这段对话，用她的模仿特质来模仿光的激动的声音（\"有人会发现这一点！他们会关闭我们的！\"），然后是巫的平静而坚定的回答（\"我们同意这个协议。我们的手是被迫的，但我们的眼睛是睁开的。我们让沙漏女巫团拿走它想要的东西，而作为回报，我们保持营业。这就是你想要的，对吗？\"）。",

Each thinks the other is untrustworthy.": "如果一个或多个角色为Madryck工作（见{@adventure introduction|WBtW|0}中的\"{@area Warlock's Quest|054|x} \"冒险钩），并且这些角色提到了Madryck的名字，Kenku就会皱起眉头，发出一声尖叫，承认她和Madryck是竞争对手，但碰巧拥有同一个赞助人（Zybilna）。双方都认为对方不值得信任。",

In the course of their travels, they could find themselves on the Brigands' Tollway, being bedeviled by a notorious brigand named {@creature Agdon Longscarf|WBtW}.": "寻找坠落的气球的人物发现它挂在一座倾斜的塔顶上。热气球的篮子里有一个叫{@creature Sir Talavar|WBtW}的笼中精灵龙骑士，他乞求人物的帮助。为了把{@creature Sir Talavar|WBtW}从他的魔笼中解救出来，角色们可能要到Telemy Hill去寻找一个拥有笼子钥匙的妖精。在旅行的过程中，他们可能会发现自己在旅店的收费公路上，被一个名叫{@creature Agdon Longscarf|WBtW}的恶名昭彰的强盗缠住。",
	"As the characters navigate the swamp, they might have one or more random encounters, as described in the \"Random Encounters in Hither\" section.": "当人物在沼泽地中航行时，他们可能会有一个或多个随机遭遇，如 \"在Hither的随机遭遇 \"部分所述。",
	"If the characters need a guide to Thither, they can find one in Downfall—home of {@creature Bavlorna Blightstraw|WBtW} and the bullywugs of the Soggy Court. This guide is an animated scarecrow named Clapperclaw, who can guide characters from Hither to Thither and back to Hither. Clapperclaw is encountered in {@adventure area D5|WBtW|3|D5. Chattering Heads}, but you can move the scarecrow elsewhere if the characters don't visit that location.": "如果角色们需要一个前往Thither的向导，他们可以在Downfall--{@creature Bavlorna Blightstraw|WBtW}和Soggy Court的恶棍们的家中找到一个。这个向导是一个名叫Clapperclaw的动画稻草人，他可以引导角色从Hither到Thither再回到Hither。稻草人在{@adventure area D5|WBtW|3|D5.

	"Prismeer was a single Feywild domain until the Hourglass Coven broke it into three splinter-realms: Hither (a vast swamp), Thither (an ancient forest), and Yon (a stormy, mountainous landscape). The only way to restore Prismeer to its former state is to free the archfey Zybilna, who is frozen in time and trapped in her palace, which sits at the point where Hither, Thither, and Yon used to be connected.": "Prismeer是一个单一的Feywild领域，直到沙漏女巫团将其分成三个分裂的领域。Hither（一个巨大的沼泽），Thither（一个古老的森林）和Yon（一个暴风雨的山地）。将Prismeer恢复到以前的状态的唯一方法是释放大酋长Zybilna，她被冻结在时间中，并被困在她的宫殿中，宫殿位于Hither、Thither和Yon曾经连接的地方。",
	"General information about Prismeer is presented in this chapter, since Hither is where the characters take their first steps in this fractured Feywild domain.": "本章介绍了有关普利斯梅尔的一般信息，因为赫特是人物在这个断裂的Feywild领域迈出第一步的地方。",
	"The poster map of Prismeer shows the Feywild domain divided into four sections: the splinter-realms of Hither, Thither, and Yon, and the Palace of Heart's Desire. These fragments are partitioned off from one another and the rest of the Feywild by walls of shimmering, silvery mist.": "普利斯梅尔的海报地图显示，Feywild领域分为四个部分：Hither、Thither和Yon的分裂领域，以及Heart's Desire宫殿。这些碎片被闪闪发光的银色雾墙分隔开来，与仙境的其他部分隔开。",
	"The hags of the Hourglass Coven and their minions can travel freely between Hither, Thither, Yon, and the Palace of Heart's Desire simply by walking into or flying over the border mist, whereupon they are instantly transported to the border of whichever part of Prismeer contains their intended destination. Most other creatures—including the characters—are forbidden from leaving one part of Prismeer and entering another. Upon reaching the edge of Hither, Thither, Yon, or the palace, they find all paths forward blocked by the mist, which disorients them and sends them back the way they came. Those who try to fly above the mist never get where they intend to go, their destination always appearing to be miles away.": "沙漏女巫团的女巫和她们的爪牙可以在Hither、Thither、Yon和Heart's Desire宫殿之间自由旅行，只需走进或飞过边界的迷雾，然后她们就会被瞬间传送到Prismeer的任何一个地方的边界，那里有她们预定的目的地。大多数其他生物--包括人物--都被禁止离开普利斯梅尔的一个部分而进入另一个部分。在到达Hither、Thither、Yon或宫殿的边缘时，他们会发现所有前进的道路都被迷雾所阻挡，迷雾使他们丧失信心，并将他们送回原路。那些试图飞越迷雾的人永远无法到达他们想要去的地方，他们的目的地似乎总是在数英里之外。",
	"The outer borders of Prismeer are blocked by similar walls of mist through which no creature can pass without Zybilna's consent (which she can't give while frozen in time). Even the hags of the Hourglass Coven are bound by this restriction; they must use {@spell plane shift} spells to leave Prismeer or reenter it. Other creatures capable of casting the spell can do the same.": "Prismeer的外部边界被类似的雾墙所阻隔，没有Zybilna的同意（她在时间冻结的情况下无法同意），任何生物都无法通过。即使是沙漏女巫会的女巫也受此限制；她们必须使用{@spell plane shift}法术才能离开Prismeer或重新进入它。其他有能力施法的生物也可以这么做。",
	"In each of Prismeer's splinter-realms, the characters can find a guide—a disloyal minion of the Hourglass Coven—who is willing and able to lead them from one splinter-realm to another. While in the company of one or more of these guides, the characters can move through the mist separating Prismeer's splinter-realms without being turned back. These guides are as follows:": "在Prismeer的每一个分裂领域中，角色们都可以找到一个向导--一个不忠于沙漏女巫会的奴才--他愿意并且能够带领他们从一个分裂领域到另一个分裂领域。在一个或多个向导的陪伴下，人物可以在分隔普利斯梅尔的分裂领域的迷雾中移动而不被折返。这些向导如下。",

	"Although Zybilna is indisposed, three of the rules she put into place when she created her Feywild domain continue to hold weight: the rule of hospitality, the rule of ownership, and the rule of reciprocity. These three rules are common knowledge in Prismeer, and both natives and visitors would do well to abide by them:": "虽然Zybilna身体不适，但她在创建Feywild领域时制定的三条规则仍然很重要：好客的规则、所有权的规则和互惠的规则。这三条规则在普利斯米尔是众所周知的，无论是本地人还是游客，都会很好地遵守它们。",
	"When a friend, an enemy, or a stranger enters your home, you are expected to be gracious and accommodating to them until such time as they prove, by their words or actions, undeserving of such hospitality.": "当一个朋友、一个敌人或一个陌生人进入你的家时，你应该对他们感到亲切和包容，直到他们通过自己的言行证明不值得这样的款待。",
	"You must not steal from a friend, an enemy, or a stranger. To take something that doesn't belong to you without the rightful owner's permission is a crime and an unforgivable breach of etiquette.": "你不能从朋友、敌人或陌生人那里偷东西。在没有合法主人的允许下拿走不属于你的东西是一种犯罪，是对礼仪的一种不可原谅的违反。",
	"When a friend, an enemy, or a stranger offers you a gift, you are obliged to accept it and offer something of comparable value (be it a gift or a service) in return. Such reciprocation need not happen immediately.": "当朋友、敌人或陌生人向你提供礼物时，你有义务接受它，并提供价值相当的东西（无论是礼物还是服务）作为回报。这种回报不需要立即发生。",
	"When Zybilna ruled Prismeer, few of her subjects dared to violate her rules. Those who did often disappeared without a trace. Now, with the Hourglass Coven in charge, the rules remain in force, though the circumstances are different. The hags believe strongly in hospitality and reciprocity, but they have a self-centered view of ownership—each claims ownership of everything in her realm. (For example, {@creature Bavlorna Blightstraw|WBtW} considers herself the owner of Hither and everything in it.)": "当Zybilna统治Prismeer时，她的臣民中很少有人敢于违反她的规则。那些违反规则的人常常消失得无影无踪。现在，随着沙漏女巫团的掌管，这些规则仍然有效，尽管情况有所不同。女巫们坚信好客和互惠，但她们对所有权有一种以自我为中心的看法--每个人都声称拥有她领域里的一切。(例如，{@creature Bavlorna Blightstraw|WBtW}认为自己是Hither的主人，以及其中的一切。）",
	"Also, the hags are far less inclined to punish those who break the rules than Zybilna was, and it's not even clear to other residents of Prismeer when a rule has been broken. For example, brigands are able to take what they want from other folk without paying for it, and nothing bad seems to happen to them as a result, but that fact alone is not enough to encourage most others to likewise break the rules—for all they know, the brigands might be acting in the hags' interests.": "而且，女巫们远不如Zybilna那样倾向于惩罚那些违反规则的人，而且对于Prismeer的其他居民来说，甚至不清楚什么时候规则被打破了。例如，强盗们能够从其他居民那里拿走他们想要的东西而不付钱，而且他们似乎没有因此而发生什么坏事，但仅仅这一事实还不足以鼓励大多数其他人同样违反规则--他们知道，强盗们可能是为了女巫们的利益而行动。",
	"If Zybilna were to return to power, strict enforcement of the rules would resume in a heartbeat, and brigands would be wise to take their propensity for malfeasance elsewhere.": "如果Zybilna重新掌权，严格的规则执行将在瞬间恢复，强盗们会明智地把他们的渎职倾向带到其他地方。",
	"In this chapter and in later chapters, the characters might encounter children who were lured to Prismeer from the Witchlight Carnival or who stumbled into Zybilna's domain by other means. These children have been stuck in Prismeer long enough to forget about the worlds they came from, yet they haven't aged much at all.": "在这一章和以后的章节中，人物可能会遇到从巫师之光狂欢节被引诱到Prismeer的孩子，或者通过其他方式偶然进入Zybilna的领域。这些孩子被困在Prismeer的时间足够长，以至于忘记了他们来自的世界，但他们根本就没怎么老。",
	"Zybilna's magic protects all children in Prismeer (but not creatures disguised as children). The hags of the Hourglass Coven are aware of this magic and unable to dispel it. Any child in Prismeer who would take damage as a consequence of another creature's actions vanishes in a burst of multicolored light and is spirited away to a safe corner of Prismeer, unharmed and unreachable from the domain's splinter-realms or the palace, until Zybilna wills the child to return to her. Children sequestered in this fashion are beyond the reach of everyone else and can't be located or scried upon using magic.": "Zybilna的魔法保护着Prismeer的所有儿童（但不包括伪装成儿童的生物）。沙漏女巫团的女巫们都知道这个魔法，并且无法驱散它。Prismeer中的任何儿童如果因为其他生物的行为而受到伤害，就会在一阵五颜六色的光芒中消失，并被带到Prismeer的一个安全角落，不受伤害，也无法从领域的分裂领域或宫殿中到达，直到Zybilna希望这个孩子回到她身边。以这种方式被封存的孩子是其他人无法触及的，而且无法被找到，也无法使用魔法进行搜救。",
	"Prismeer, like other Feywild domains, is shaped by the emotions of the creatures that inhabit it. Even creatures of little consequence can transform the domain in minor ways as long as no other, more powerful force is exerting its influence. For example, flowers might wilt in the presence of a goblin who is terribly unhappy. Similarly, a satyr's laughter might cause a smile to appear on the trunk of an inanimate tree nearby. A more powerful creature, such as a hag, can reshape a larger portion of the domain to reflect their emotional state. An archfey is so attuned to the Feywild that their emotions can suffuse an entire domain, overriding the emotional influence of all other creatures in it. From that standpoint, Zybilna's dormancy enables other creatures to affect Prismeer more than they could if she were still active.": "Prismeer，像其他Feywild领域一样，被居住在其中的生物的情绪所塑造。只要没有其他更强大的力量在施加影响，即使是没什么影响的生物也能以微小的方式改变这个领域。例如，在一个非常不开心的妖精面前，花朵可能会枯萎。同样，一个萨提尔的笑声可能会使附近无生命的树干上出现一个微笑。一个更强大的生物，如女巫，可以重塑领域的更大部分以反映他们的情绪状态。一个大法师与精灵世界如此契合，他们的情绪可以充斥整个领域，凌驾于所有其他生物的情绪影响之上。从这个角度看，兹比娜的休眠使其他生物能够比她仍然活跃时更多地影响普利斯梅尔。",
	"As the characters make their way across the splintered realms of Prismeer, any emotional outburst or change in mood they exhibit might be accompanied by a minor reaction in the environment, which you can determine by choosing an entry that you like from the Domain Transformation table or by rolling on the table to determine a random result. Not every emotion felt in Prismeer is worthy of a roll on the table; you can save these effects for occasions when emotions are running high, to remind your players that the Feywild is not like the Material Plane. Because these effects have no impact on the story, you can forgo using the table if you want.": "当角色在Prismeer的分裂领域中前进时，他们表现出的任何情绪爆发或情绪变化都可能伴随着环境中的轻微反应，你可以通过从领域转换表中选择一个你喜欢的条目来确定，或者通过在表中滚动来确定一个随机结果。并非每一种在普利斯梅尔感受到的情绪都值得在桌子上滚动；你可以把这些效果留到情绪高涨的场合，以提醒你的玩家，仙界与物质世界不同。因为这些效果对故事没有影响，如果你愿意，你可以放弃使用这个表格。",
	"If Zybilna is released from her temporal stasis, the ability of other creatures to alter her domain is suppressed until she is {@condition incapacitated}, killed, or no longer in Prismeer.": "如果Zybilna从她的时空静止中被释放出来，其他生物改变她的领域的能力会被抑制，直到她被{@condition incapacitated}，被杀死，或者不再在Prismeer。",

	"Whenever a creature—including a player character—dies in Prismeer, its death has a chance of triggering one of several magical effects put in place by Zybilna. The effect is determined by rolling a {@dice d8} and referring to the Death Effects table.": "每当一个生物--包括玩家角色--在Prismeer死亡时，它的死亡有机会触发Zybilna设置的几个魔法效果之一。该效果是通过滚动{@dice d8}并参考死亡效果表来决定的。",

	"Hither's fetid waters rise and fall sporadically. In minutes, neck-deep murk might recede to reveal a soggy landscape of squelching mud and skeletal mangrove roots, but only until the waters ooze back into the swamp to fill it once again in an hour or three.

	"The characters find an abandoned, 8-foot-square wooden raft that can support up to 1,200 pounds. The characters need a 10-foot pole or similar tool to guide the raft across the water.

It weighs 300 pounds.": "角色们发现了一个被遗弃的8英尺见方的木筏，可以支撑1200磅的重量。人物需要一根10英尺长的杆子或类似工具来引导木筏过水。当沼泽地的水位降到最低时，木筏就会卡在泥土里，除非被人抬着或拖着，否则不会动弹。它有300磅重。",
	"The characters hear the rush of water in the distance. If they investigate, they come to an o'-well that is 10 feet tall and 5 feet in diameter. A steady geyser of water shoots from the well, rising to a height of 30 feet above the well. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 13 or higher see {@dice 1d4} Feywild trinkets bobbing in the water at the top of the geyser.

For each trinket, one {@condition invisible} {@creature will-o'-wisp} hovers within 5 feet of the geyser.": "角色们听到了远处传来的水声。如果他们进行调查，他们会来到一个10英尺高、5英尺直径的井边。一股稳定的水柱从井中喷出，升至井上30英尺的高度。被动智慧({@skill Perception})得分在13分以上的角色可以看到{@dice 1d4}间歇泉顶部的水中晃动的精灵小饰品。(在介绍中的{@area Feywild Trinkets table|01a|x}上滚动，以依次确定每一个。) 每个饰品都有一个{@condition invisible}{@creature will-o'-wisp}在间歇泉的5英尺范围内徘徊。",
	"The geyser is powerful enough to lift up to 300 pounds into the air, and the flow of water can be stopped if the well is covered by something weighing more than 300 pounds. If the water is prevented from erupting, anything being lifted by the geyser plummets to the ground within 5 feet of the base of the well.": "间歇泉的力量足以将300磅的东西举到空中，如果井口被超过300磅的东西覆盖，水流就会停止。如果水被阻止喷发，被间歇泉抬起的东西就会坠落到井底5英尺内的地面。",
	"The will-o'-wisps are the spirits of creatures who owned the trinkets in life. If a character tries to take one or more of the trinkets, the will-o'-wisps turn visible, accuse the character of being a dishonorable thief, and insist that the stolen items be returned to the well at once. The will-o'-wisps will also accept a different trinket as payment for one that was stolen. They attack if the character fails to return the stolen trinkets or provide worthy substitutes.": "O'-wisps是生前拥有这些饰品的生物的灵魂。如果一个角色试图拿走一个或多个饰品，will-o'-wisps就会出现，指责该角色是一个不光彩的小偷，并坚持要求立即将被盗物品送回井中。巫师们也会接受不同的饰品作为被盗饰品的报酬。如果角色未能归还被盗的饰品或提供有价值的替代品，它们就会攻击。",
	"The Inn at the End of the Road is the only inn in Hither. It crawls through the swamp on fleshy legs and has a walking speed of 30 feet. Its movement is not reduced by swampy terrain or water up to 10 feet deep. It crosses the characters' path as they make their way through the swamp. Every mile, the inn stops for 10 minutes and lowers itself so that guests can enter or exit without risking injury.": "路尽头的旅店是希尔特唯一的旅店。它用肉质的腿在沼泽中爬行，行走速度为30英尺。它的行动不会因为沼泽地形或10英尺深的水而减少。当人物在沼泽中前进时，它将穿过人物的路径。每隔一英里，旅店就会停下来10分钟，并将自己放低，以便客人可以在没有受伤风险的情况下进入或离开。",

	"The inn is a squat, three-story structure with a slate-shingled roof and worm-eaten wood walls. Dozens of tiny orbs of pale light buzz about the exterior like flies. The structure rocks and heaves while in motion, but these movements cannot be perceived from inside the inn.": "这家旅馆是一个扁平的三层楼结构，有一个板条状的屋顶和被虫蛀的木墙。几十个微小的淡色光球像苍蝇一样在外部嗡嗡作响。结构在运动时摇晃和起伏，但这些运动从客栈内部无法察觉。",
	"As the inn passes by the characters, they catch the smell of hearty stew wafting from its open windows and see smoke rising in cottony puffs from its stone chimney.": "当客栈从人物身边经过时，他们闻到了从敞开的窗户里飘出的丰盛的炖菜的味道，看到烟从石烟囱里冒出棉絮状的烟雾。",

	"Tsu despises Bavlorna. If the characters mention the hag or the Hourglass Coven, the druid spits and mutters, \"In Zybilna's time, this inn was the talk of Prismeer.\" She speaks about Zybilna reverently, though her tone remains morose.": "津鄙视巴弗洛纳。如果人物提到女巫或沙漏女巫会，德鲁伊就会吐口水，并喃喃自语：\"在齐比尔纳的时代，这家旅馆是普利斯梅尔的话题。\" 她虔诚地谈论着齐比尔纳，尽管她的语气仍然很低沉。",
	"One of the hazards of Hither is marsh gas, which erupts from iridescent bubbles in the muck. When a bubble touches something edged, such as a twig or a blade of grass, it pops, releasing its gas with a sound of stifled laughter. The gas smells like old cheese.": "沼泽地的危害之一是沼泽地气体，它从淤泥中的彩虹色气泡中喷发出来。当气泡接触到有棱角的东西，如树枝或草叶时，它就会爆裂，释放出气体，发出令人窒息的笑声。这种气体闻起来像老奶酪。",
	"As the characters cross the swamp, they encounter a field of marsh gas bubbles and must make a DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) group check. If the group check is successful, the characters avoid popping any of the bubbles as they wade through the field. On a failed check, a bubble bursts within 10 feet of the character who had the lowest check result, perhaps catching other nearby characters in its area at your discretion.": "当角色们穿过沼泽地时，他们遇到了一片沼泽地的气泡，必须进行DC 10智慧({@skill Survival})团体检查。如果团体检定成功，角色们在穿越沼泽地时将避免爆出任何气泡。如果检定失败，气泡会在检定结果最低的角色的10英尺范围内爆裂，也许会把附近的其他角色卷入其范围内，由你决定。",

	"Babble Gas. Whenever the character speaks, their words come out as gibberish that only the character and others affected by the gas can understand. This effect does not impede the character's ability to cast spells that have verbal components.": "胡言乱语的气体。每当角色说话时，他们的话语就会变成胡言乱语，只有角色和受气体影响的人能够理解。这个效果并不妨碍该角色施展含有语言成分的法术的能力。",

	"This encounter takes place in a mist-veiled field of tall swamp grass dotted with clusters of cattails. It begins when the characters hear rustling in the vegetation ahead of them. The sound foreshadows the arrival of six Humanoid creatures on stilts. The stilts allow these creatures to move more easily through the muck and to stay above the water. Their walking speed on stilts is 30 feet, and this movement is not reduced by mud or water.": "这场遭遇战发生在一片被雾气笼罩的高大沼泽草地上，上面点缀着一簇簇鲶鱼。当角色们听到前面的植被有沙沙声时，就开始了。这个声音预示着六个踩着高跷的人形生物的到来。高跷让这些生物更容易在淤泥中移动，并停留在水面上。他们在高跷上的行走速度是30英尺，而且这种移动不会因为泥土或水而减少。",
	"If they are left alone, the stilt walkers pass by the characters without so much as a greeting. If the characters try to communicate, the stilt walkers stop and regard them silently for a moment before prompting them to continue. If asked about what they're doing, the stilt walkers explain (in Goblin or, if necessary, in Common) that they are gathering eggs for trading in Downfall. They know in which direction Downfall is located and share that information freely. If the characters attack the stilt walkers, the hobgoblins flee.": "如果他们被单独留下，高跷演员从人物身边经过，甚至连招呼都不打一声。如果角色试图交流，高跷会停下来，静静地看他们一会儿，然后提示他们继续。如果被问及他们在做什么，高跷解释说（用哥布林语，如果有必要，用普通话），他们在收集鸡蛋，以便在Downfall进行交易。他们知道Downfall在哪个方向，并自由地分享这一信息。如果角色们攻击高跷，妖精们就会逃跑。",
	"When the water level of the swamp is low, the characters chance upon a 10-foot-wide stream. Unknown to them, the stream flows from Downfall, and any character who looks into the water's reflective surface catches a glimpse of an event transpiring in Downfall at that very moment. Each character who looks might see something different. Roll a {@dice d8} and consult the Stream of Visions table to determine what each character sees. Each character can receive only one such vision.": "当沼泽的水位较低时，人物偶然发现了一条10英尺宽的小溪。他们不知道的是，这条小河是从地下城流出来的，任何看向水面反光的角色都能瞥见那一刻在地下城发生的一件事。每个看的人都可能看到不同的东西。掷一个{@dice d8}，然后参考 \"幻象之流 \"表，以确定每个角色看到了什么。每个角色只能得到一个这样的幻象。",

As the figure approaches the house, their shadow seems to detach from their body, move across the walls of the house, and crawl through an open window.": "一个瘦高的身影戴着一顶尖尖的黑色帽子，披着一件带帽的黑色斗篷，爬上一个摇摇欲坠的楼梯，通向一栋建在高跷上的破烂的大房子。当这个人物接近房子时，他们的影子似乎从他们的身体上分离出来，在房子的墙壁上移动，并从一扇打开的窗户爬了进去。",

	"Each suit of animated armor mimics the movements of the character closest to it. For example, if the character closest to a suit of armor swings a sword, the armor makes a similar gesture, though it wields no weapons. If the character casts a spell, the suit uses its action to mimic the somatic component of casting a spell on its next turn, though it lacks the ability to cast spells. If one or both suits are attacked, they stop mimicking the characters and defend themselves. Otherwise, they are harmless. They can't leave the battlefield.": "每套动画盔甲都会模仿离它最近的角色的动作。例如，如果最靠近盔甲的角色挥舞剑，盔甲也会做出类似的动作，尽管它没有挥舞武器。如果角色施法，盔甲会在下一回合使用它的行动来模仿施法的体能部分，尽管它缺乏施法的能力。如果一个或两个套装被攻击，它们会停止模仿人物并进行自我防御。否则，它们是无害的。它们不能离开战场。",
	"The following encounters are tied to locations marked on the map of Hither. Move these locations as needed to put them in the characters' path, and chalk up any discrepancy with the map to the shifty nature of the Feywild. (The Feywild is known to play tricks on travelers, redirecting them without their knowledge to places they are meant to go. Consequently, the characters might think they're heading toward one part of Hither, only to find themselves arriving somewhere else.) Ideally, you should run all three encounters in the following order before the characters arrive at Downfall:": "下面的遭遇与Hither地图上标记的地点相关联。请根据需要移动这些地点，使其位于角色的路径上，并将任何与地图的差异归结为妖精的狡猾本质。(众所周知，Feywild会捉弄旅行者，在他们不知情的情况下将他们转到他们本该去的地方。因此，角色们可能会认为他们正朝着Hither的某个地方前进，但却发现自己来到了其他地方）。理想情况下，你应该在人物到达下城之前按以下顺序进行这三个遭遇战。",
	"The last of these encounters is with a native of Prismeer who remembers what the domain was like before the Hourglass Coven shattered it. {@creature Agdon Longscarf|WBtW}, a nefarious bandit leader, can tell the characters how to reach Downfall if they get the better of him.": "最后一次遇到的是一个Prismeer的本地人，他还记得沙漏女巫团打碎这个领地之前是什么样子。{@creature Agdon Longscarf|WBtW}，一个邪恶的强盗首领，如果他们能得到他的帮助，可以告诉他们如何到达道夫。",

	"As the characters approach the edge of the bramble patch, they hear a whispered voice say in Common, \"Psst. You there, I need your help.\" The whisper comes from the basket that dangles from the top of the tower. If a character responds with anything louder than a whisper, a quick \"Shush!\" cuts them off. The voice belongs to {@creature Sir Talavar|WBtW}, who quietly explains his predicament:": "当人物接近荆棘丛的边缘时，他们听到一个低语的声音用普通话说：\"嘘，你在那里，我需要你的帮助。\" 这个低语来自于塔顶上悬挂的篮子。如果一个角色用比耳语更响亮的声音回应，一句快速的 \"嘘！\"就会打断他们。这个声音属于{@creature Sir Talavar|WBtW}，他悄悄地解释他的困境。",

	"Prior to the events of this adventure, {@creature Sir Talavar|WBtW}, a noble faerie dragon and emissary of Titania the Summer Queen, traveled to Prismeer to persuade Zybilna to ally with the Seelie Court against its hated enemies, the fomorians. {@creature Sir Talavar|WBtW} soon discovered that Prismeer had been seized by the hags of the Hourglass Coven.

In that case, the creature's reflection also smiles, and a secret door in the wall holding the mirror swings inward, revealing a hidden passage ({@area area B9|1bd|x}).": "一个{@spell detect magic}的法术在这面镜子周围显示了一个转化魔法的光环。镜子的框架以{@item sovereign glue}粘在墙上，如果不破坏它，就无法移除镜子。这面镜子改变了任何注视它的生物的反射，使反射没有表情或情绪，除非有生物对着镜子微笑。在这种情况下，该生物的倒影也会微笑，并且在装着镜子的墙上有一扇秘密的门向内打开，露出一个隐藏的通道（{@area area B9|1bd|x}）。",
	"This is a dusty, uncluttered room. Several shadow boxes hang on the wall to either side of a modest bed with moldering linens. Most of the shadow boxes contain mummified pixies pinned to boards like a collection of butterflies. The glass on one of the shadow boxes has been broken, and its contents are missing.": "这是一个尘土飞扬、不甚整洁的房间。几个影盒挂在墙上，在一张铺着发霉床单的简陋的床的两边。大多数影盒里都有木乃伊式的小精灵，像蝴蝶的集合体一样被钉在木板上。其中一个影盒的玻璃被打破了，里面的东西也不见了。",

Lifting the needle allows the tiny door to be pulled open easily, revealing a moldy stretch of floor underneath the potion cabinet that stands against the wall in area B10.": "一堵实心墙似乎挡住了通往B10区的通道，但仔细观察，发现墙根处有一个2英寸宽、4英寸高的老鼠洞。这个老鼠洞被一扇小木门挡住了，木门的这一边被一根钢针挡住。抬起针头可以轻易地拉开这扇小门，露出B10区靠墙的药水柜下面的一片发霉的地板。",
	"Two creatures are having a conversation over tea in the middle of this room. The first figure is seated in a timeworn armchair. She is a tall, lean woman of gray complexion, dressed in black with a wide-brimmed hat obscuring her eyes. The other figure is a toad-like creature with bulging eyes and cracked skin. It is clad in a shapeless garment and sits on one end of a love seat with its legs pulled up beneath it. Flies flit into and out of its mouth, which hangs agape when it isn't speaking. Two tiny versions of the creature cling to it like pets.": "在这个房间的中央，有两个生物正在喝茶交谈。第一个人物坐在一张陈旧的扶手椅上。她是一个高瘦的女人，肤色灰白，身着黑衣，宽边帽遮住了她的眼睛。另一个人物是一个蛤蟆状的生物，眼睛凸出，皮肤开裂。它穿着一件没有形状的衣服，坐在一张爱情座椅的一端，腿被拉起来放在下面。苍蝇在它的嘴里飞进飞出，当它不说话的时候，它的嘴就悬空着。两个微小的生物像宠物一样依附在它身上。",
	"The room is filthy. Dirty dishes and bits of discarded food lie everywhere. The furniture was perhaps once of fine quality, but now stains of mysterious origin mottle every surface, and the upholstery has been patched numerous times.

When the characters arrive, Charm is gossiping with Bavlorna about the hag's sisters, Endelyn and Skabatha. The conversation is a distraction, buying time for Charm's shadow to perpetrate a heist in area B19. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 13 or higher notice that the black-clad figure doesn't cast a shadow. This is not a trait that darklings possess, but rather the result of Endelyn's using her {@item scissors of shadow snipping|WBtW} (see {@adventure appendix A|WBtW|6}) to cut loose Charm's shadow and transform it into a separate creature.

	"Bavlorna's Big Book of Bad Blood has gone missing. It contains copious notes on everyone who has wronged her. She assumes the book hasn't been taken far and wants the characters to search Downfall for it. (The book is currently in the hands of Gullop XIX, the bullywug king in {@adventure area D6|WBtW|3|D6.

	"When all three chores are complete, Bavlorna insists on taking a short rest in her preservation pool to moisten her skin. Only then will she consider bargaining with the characters.": "当这三件杂事都完成后，巴弗洛娜坚持要在她的保鲜池里短暂休息一下，以滋润她的皮肤。只有到那时，她才会考虑与这些人物讨价还价。",
	"While the characters are busy performing one or more of Bavlorna's unfinished chores, the darkling elder and her elusive shadow find what they were after and return to their balloon ({@adventure area D10|WBtW|3|D10.

	"If you used the \"Lost Things\" adventure hook and the {@adventure Story Tracker|WBtW|11} indicates that Bavlorna has one or more things in her possession that the characters desire, she agrees to give up these items on one condition: she wants the characters to steal a portrait of her older sister, Skabatha, and deliver it to Bavlorna's cottage within eight days. Bavlorna provides three pieces of information before spitting into her hand and requiring the characters to shake it, thus sealing the bargain:": "如果你使用了 \"丢失的东西 \"冒险钩子，并且{@adventure Story Tracker|WBtW|11}表明Bavlorna有一件或多件人物想要的东西，她同意放弃这些东西，但有一个条件：她要人物偷一张她姐姐Skabatha的画像，并在八天内把它送到Bavlorna的小屋里。Bavlorna提供了三条信息，然后向她的手吐口水，要求人物握手，从而完成交易。",
	"Loomlurch is a giant, hollowed-out tree located deep in the forest of Thither. Skabatha uses it as a lair.": "Loomlurch是一棵巨大的、被挖空的树，位于Thither的森林深处。斯卡巴塔（Skabatha）将其作为一个巢穴。",

If the characters fail to deliver Skabatha's portrait within the agreed-upon time, each character who agreed to the bargain must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or be cursed. While cursed in this way, the character loses one cherished possession (chosen by you). This possession disappears and is not regained until the curse ends. Bavlorna can end the curse on a character (no action required), as can any spell that ends a curse.": "如果Skabatha的画像被准时送到Bavlorna，巫婆就完成了她的交易。如果角色们未能在约定的时间内将Skabatha的画像送达，每个同意交易的角色必须在DC19魅力救赎中成功，否则将被诅咒。当被诅咒时，该角色将失去一件珍爱的物品（由你选择）。这个财物会消失，直到诅咒结束才会恢复。Bavlorna可以结束对一个角色的诅咒（不需要行动），正如任何可以结束诅咒的法术一样。",
	"If the characters were drawn to Prismeer by the \"Warlock's Quest\" adventure hook, they can strike a different bargain with Bavlorna, but she won't deal with anyone who claims to be searching for a way to help Zybilna and thereby weaken the Hourglass Coven. First and foremost, Bavlorna wants Skabatha's portrait (with the same time restrictions as the \"Lost Things\" bargain above) and is willing to trade for it. Once she has the portrait, her greed might focus on something else in Skabatha's possession, at your discretion.": "如果人物是被 \"术士的任务 \"的冒险钩子吸引到Prismeer的，他们可以与Bavlorna达成不同的交易，但她不会与任何声称在寻找帮助Zybilna从而削弱沙漏女巫的方法的人交易。首先，也是最重要的，巴弗洛娜想要斯卡巴塔的画像（时间限制与上述 \"丢失的东西 \"的交易相同），并愿意用它来交换。一旦她得到了画像，她的贪婪可能会集中在斯卡巴塔拥有的其他东西上，由你决定。",
	"If Bavlorna feels threatened, or if a fight turns against her, she flees to Thither on her {@item bobbing lily pad|WBtW} (in {@area area B1|1a6|x}) and reluctantly takes refuge with her older sister, Skabatha (see {@adventure chapter 3|WBtW|3} for details).": "如果巴弗洛尔娜感到受到威胁，或者一场战斗对她不利，她就会骑着她的{@item bobbing lily pad|WBtW}(在{@area area B1|1a6|x})逃到Thither，并不情愿地与她的姐姐Skabatha一起避难（详见{@adventure chapter 3|WBtW|3}）。",

	"The dryad, Meadowleaf, was bound to an enchanted tree that Granny Nightshade felled and used to make wooden toys.

	"The dryad is too bitter and angry to apologize for any errors in judgment on her part. Reminding her of the rule of hospitality (see \"{@area Rules of Conduct|105|x}\" in {@adventure chapter 2|WBtW|2}) is enough to convince her that she should be nicer to travelers passing through the forest, which is the closest thing she has to a home now that her beloved tree is gone.": "这个干尸太过痛苦和愤怒，不会为她的任何判断错误道歉。提醒她好客的规则（见{@adventure chapter 2|WBtW|2}中的\"{@area Rules of Conduct|105|x}\"）足以说服她，她应该对经过森林的旅行者好一点，因为现在她心爱的树已经不在了，森林是她最接近的家。",

One thing the characters can do is gather up the redcaps' sickles (which they dropped when they started throwing rocks at the tree). The seizure of these weapons causes the goats to attack.": "如果人物接近这棵树并且不表现出威胁性，三个名叫金盏花、卡露娜和紫荆花的小精灵就会出现，并警告人物不要杀死山羊，以免它们变回红帽。这些小精灵是非暴力的，并希望得到人物的帮助。角色们可以做的一件事是收集红帽的镰刀（它们在开始向树上扔石头时掉落的）。缴获这些武器后，山羊们就会发动攻击。",
	"If they are deprived of their weapons and returned to their normal forms, the redcaps stomp their iron boots and demand that their sickles be returned to them.

If the characters seem unable to deal with the redcaps on their own, the pixies use their magic to assist.": "如果他们被剥夺了武器并恢复了正常形态，红帽会跺着他们的铁靴，要求把镰刀还给他们。如果角色拒绝这样做，红帽就会愤怒地大叫，并在跺脚离开之前大肆咒骂。没有了镰刀，这些红帽人就会虚张声势。如果他们的武器被还给他们，红帽就会攻击角色，希望用角色的血来浸透他们的帽子。如果人物似乎无法独自对付红帽，小精灵们就会用他们的魔法来协助。",

	"Three {@creature Pixie||pixies} sit around a tiny table, sipping tea and nibbling cakes. A 6-inch-long wedge made of wood lies on the ground nearby. The pixies found this piece of wood (a doorstop) on one of their recent forays into the Material Plane and are arguing about what it could be.

	"The pixies entreat the characters to settle their dispute. They are profoundly disappointed to learn of the doorstop's mundane purpose and giggle with delight if they are treated to a convincing lie. Either way, they give a reed whistle to the character who impressed them the most. Once before the end of this adventure, that character can blow the whistle to summon the three pixies. This effect functions as a {@spell conjure woodland beings} spell that summons only the three pixies and doesn't require concentration. The pixies fly away when the spell ends after 1 hour.": "小精灵们恳求这些人物解决他们的争端。他们得知门挡的平凡用途后深感失望，如果他们被一个令人信服的谎言所吸引，则会高兴地笑起来。无论怎样，他们都会把一个芦苇哨子送给给他们留下最深刻印象的人物。在这次冒险结束前，该角色可以吹响哨子来召唤这三个小精灵。这个效果就像一个{@spell conjure woodland beings}的法术，只召唤三个小精灵，不需要集中注意力。1小时后法术结束时，小精灵会飞走。",

If a character asks Nib to make something specific, Nib honors that request, provided the desired item is a nonmagical item worth no more than 1,000 gp, or a magic item of common or uncommon rarity. Nib can make only one gift for each character, and his spinning wheel can't work its magic under any other hand. Nib's supply of gold coins decreases by an amount equal to the value of the item he creates (minimum 1 gp).

	"A character might feel obliged to honor the rule of reciprocity (see \"Rules of Conduct\" in chapter 2) and offer Nib something in return for his gifts. Nib kindly accepts whatever the character offers but isn't looking for help to end his curse, because as long as Granny Nightshade remains in control of Thither, he sees no hope of escape.": "一个角色可能觉得有义务遵守互惠规则（见第二章的 \"行为规则\"），并为尼布的礼物提供一些回报。尼布善意地接受了这个角色提供的任何东西，但并不寻求帮助来结束他的诅咒，因为只要夜影婆婆仍然控制着瑟瑟，他就看不到逃脱的希望。",

The ghoul assumes that the characters are Granny Nightshade's workers, sent to fetch her for a new task.

	"The portraits are enchanted to display the last creature that pricked its skin on the brambles' thorns in addition to its four closest family members, if it has any. These family members can be living or dead. (If the creature has fewer than four close family members, any remaining portraits are blank.) Each portrait magically animates to create the impression that the subject is looking around and shifting uncomfortably, but the animation has the quality of an old movie. The moving images are silent.": "画像被施了魔法，显示最后一个被荆棘刺破皮肤的生物，以及它的四个最亲密的家庭成员，如果它有的话。这些家庭成员可以是活的或死的。(如果该生物的近亲少于四人，剩下的画像都是空白的）。每张画像都会神奇地产生动画，让人觉得主体在四处张望，不自觉地晃动，但这种动画具有老电影的质量。移动的图像是无声的。",

A character can use an action to try to spot the hidden boggles, doing so with a successful DC 16 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. Because of the children's fearful glances, the characters have advantage on this check. The boggles avoid combat, surrendering if they face certain harm.": "三个{@creature Boggle|VGM|boggles}(见{@adventure appendix C|WBtW|8})在没有人的时候对童工们耍花招。当人物到达时，这些怪兽被藏在房间的角落里，尽管孩子们向怪兽们投去恐惧的目光，希望人物能注意到发生了什么事。一个角色可以用一个行动来尝试发现隐藏的boggles，只要成功地进行DC 16智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查即可。由于孩子们恐惧的眼神，人物在这个检定上有优势。妖怪们会避免战斗，如果他们面临一定的伤害就会投降。",
	"If Squirt is with the party, it encourages the characters to acquire as much slippery boggle oil as they can (see the \"{@area Boggle Oil|244|x}\" sidebar earlier in the chapter).

The effect lasts until she finishes her next long rest or until she takes damage from the creature, at which point she remembers everything.

These casks are used to ferment a mixture of water and honey, which Mudlump combines with other ingredients to make honey mead. A great beehive—considerably larger than the one Mudlump carries around—fills an ancient, rotted-out tree stump on one side of the tower. The stump is 10 feet tall, twice as wide, and has openings at the top through which Mudlump can reach into the hive.

	"The safest way to free Feenia from the kite without aging her is to untie the bows, which can be accomplished only while the kite is on the ground (see \"The Kite Falls\" below).

A dreadful place indeed.\" Obud suggests a trade: knowledge of the location of the tunnel in exchange for something that would benefit him and his fellow brigganocks. Ending the quarrel between the brigganocks and the korreds would suffice (see the \"{@area Brigganocks and Korreds|2b2|x}\" sidebar earlier in the chapter). Obud also accepts tasty food, including but not limited to sweets, a wheel of cheese, or a head of lettuce. Candy from the {@area Witchlight Carnival|0c1|x} or the {@area goblin market|232|x} in Loomlurch would suffice.": "欧布德又老又累，但既不太老也不太累，对这些人物表现出热情好客。他欢迎他们来到他的石窟，把他们介绍给凯格，并问他们为什么要越过鸿沟来见他。如果他们问起通往母港的秘密隧道，他就说：\"啊，是的。爬行的林氏恐怖剧场。真是个可怕的地方。\" 奥布德建议进行一项交易：用隧道位置的知识来换取对他和他的旅居者同伴有利的东西。结束布里格诺克人和科瑞德人之间的争吵就足够了（见本章前面的\"{@area Brigganocks and Korreds|2b2|x} \"侧边栏）。奥布德也接受美味的食物，包括但不限于糖果、一轮奶酪或一头莴苣。从卢姆勒奇的{@area Witchlight Carnival|0c1|x}或{@area goblin market|232|x}处得到的糖果就足够了。",
	"A permanent illusion of a rock wall conceals an 8-foot-high, 3-foot-wide tunnel in the back wall of Obud's grotto. This secret tunnel leads to a storage room ({@area area M12|31c|x}) beneath Motherhorn's stage. The illusory wall has no substance, which means that creatures and objects can pass right through it. A successful casting of {@spell dispel magic} (DC 19) causes the illusory wall to disappear.": "在奥布德石窟的后墙上，有一个永久的岩壁假象，隐藏着一条8英尺高、3英尺宽的隧道。这条秘密通道通向母角台下的一个储藏室（{@area area M12|31c|x}）。这面虚幻的墙没有实体，这意味着生物和物体可以直接穿过它。成功施展{@spell dispel magic}(DC19)会使虚幻的墙壁消失。",
	"Obud informs the characters that Creeping Lyn is unaware of this tunnel's existence (\"Let's keep it that way, aye?\" he adds). The characters can return to the grotto through the tunnel whenever they want, provided they are on good terms with the brigganocks. If the characters use the tunnel without Obud's consent, brigganock miners spend the next 8 hours collapsing the tunnel on itself, preventing the characters from returning to the mine by that route.": "奥布德告诉角色们，\"爬行的林 \"并不知道这条隧道的存在（\"让我们保持这种状态，好吗？\"他补充道）。只要人物与旅居者关系良好，他们可以随时通过隧道返回石窟。如果人物未经奥布德同意使用隧道，布里格诺克矿工就会在接下来的8个小时内把隧道压塌，使人物无法通过这条路线返回矿区。",
	"Check the {@adventure Story Tracker|WBtW|11} to see if any of the characters made wishes while with Northwind (see \"{@area Hour 1: Welcome Gifts|0ec|x}\" in {@adventure chapter 1|WBtW|1}). If so, echoes of their wishes have crystallized in the depths of Yon and were mined by the brigganocks. As the characters are preparing to leave the mine, a cheerful brigganock named Ajak arrives with a wheelbarrow containing the characters' wish stones. These stones look like round lumps of crystal and have not yet been shaped or cut. If a character's wish was good-natured, its stone glows with golden light (bright light out to a range of 20 feet and dim light for an additional 20 feet). If the wish was evil-natured, its stone glows with purple light (bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet).": "检查{@adventure Story Tracker|WBtW|11}，看是否有任何角色在与北风一起时许了愿（见{@adventure chapter 1|WBtW|1}中的\"{@area Hour 1: Welcome Gifts|0ec|x}\"）。如果是的话，他们的愿望的回声已经在Yon的深处结晶，并被brigganocks开采了。当人物准备离开矿场时，一个名叫Ajak的欢快的brigganock来到这里，用手推车装着人物的愿望石。这些石头看起来像圆形的水晶块，还没有被塑形或切割。如果一个角色的愿望是善意的，那么它的石头就会发出金色的光芒（20英尺范围内为亮光，另外20英尺为暗光）。如果愿望是邪恶的，它的石头会发出紫色的光（在5英尺范围内发出亮光，另外5英尺范围内发出暗光）。",
	"Characters whose wishes were good-hearted can keep their stones as mementos or leave the stones with the brigganocks to be cut into sparkling gemstones—a process that takes 8 hours with the help of the brigganocks' Time Lapse action. (The characters can return to the mine to collect their gems after attending to other matters.) A fairly common wish produces a 50 gp gemstone, an unusual wish produces a 100 gp gemstone, and an exceptionally original wish produces a 500 gp gemstone (as determined by you). Once a wish stone is cut into a gem, it loses its magic and ceases to glow.": "那些心地善良的角色可以保留他们的宝石作为纪念品，或者把宝石留给旅居者，让他们切割成闪闪发光的宝石--在旅居者的时间推移动作的帮助下，这个过程需要8小时。(角色们在处理完其他事情后，可以回到矿场领取宝石）。一个相当普通的愿望会产生一个50GP的宝石，一个不寻常的愿望会产生一个100GP的宝石，而一个特别新颖的愿望会产生一个500GP的宝石（由你决定）。一旦愿望石被切割成宝石，它就会失去魔力并停止发光。",
	"The brigganocks don't make gemstones out of malignant wish stones. Instead, they toss these purple-glowing stones into Rivenwish Chasm unless the characters who created them want to take the stones with them. Mild nausea plagues any good-aligned creature that has one or more of these stones in its possession, though this nausea has no game effect.": "布里格诺克人不会用恶毒的愿望石来制作宝石。相反，他们把这些发着紫光的石头扔进瑞文维什峡谷，除非创造它们的角色想把石头带走。轻微的恶心困扰着任何拥有一颗或多颗这种石头的善良生物，不过这种恶心没有游戏效果。",

	"If Endelyn's sisters were forced to flee to Motherhorn, here is where they park their flying mounts (Bavlorna's lily pad and Skabatha's rocking horse).

The steady hiss of all those falling grains of sand can be heard throughout the room.": "几十个沙漏被固定在墙上。每当沙漏的沙子用完时，将沙漏固定在墙上的装置就会使它翻转过来。整个房间都能听到所有这些沙粒掉落的稳定嘶嘶声。",

On a failed check, the marionettes hanging from the ceiling scream \"Intruders!\" over and over until Endelyn commands them to stop or until they are all destroyed. Each marionette has AC 15, 1 hit point, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Any character who has interacted with korreds can tell that the marionettes are strung with iron wires made from korred hair, and any character who knows the korreds' special jig (see \"{@area Korred Dance|2b7|x}\" earlier in the chapter) can command the hair to wind itself around the marionettes' jaws, preventing them from screaming.": "要想在房间里安静地走动，角色必须在DC12的灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查中成功。如果检定失败，悬挂在天花板上的木偶就会一遍又一遍地尖叫 \"入侵者！\"，直到恩德林命令它们停止或者它们被全部摧毁。每个牵线木偶有15点攻击力，1点命中率，对毒药和精神伤害免疫。任何与科瑞德人打过交道的人物都能看出，这些牵线木偶是用科瑞德人的头发制成的铁丝串起来的，任何知道科瑞德人的特殊动作（见本章前面的\"{@area Korred Dance|2b7|x}\"）的人物都能命令头发缠绕在牵线木偶的下巴上，防止它们发出尖叫。",

	"The wicker basket belonged to Endelyn's missing cat, {@creature Gloam|WBtW}, which the characters might have found in {@area chapter 2|1c3|x}. Harmless cat toys (three tiny, stuffed birds from Bavlorna and three tiny, wind-up clockwork birds from Skabatha) are strewn around the basket. A creature can use an action to wind the key on one of the clockwork birds, causing it to chirp softly and shuffle its feet. If placed on the floor, the wound-up bird walks counterclockwise in a 5-foot-diameter circle, completing one circle every 10 seconds. After walking for 30 seconds, the bird stops moving and chirping until it is wound up again.": "这个柳条篮子属于恩德林失踪的猫，{@creature Gloam|WBtW}，人物可能在{@area chapter 2|1c3|x}找到它。篮子周围散落着无害的猫咪玩具（三只来自Bavlorna的小毛绒鸟和三只来自Skabatha的小发条鸟）。一个生物可以用一个动作给其中一只发条鸟的钥匙上发条，使它轻声鸣叫并洗脚。如果放在地板上，上了发条的鸟会在一个5英尺直径的圆圈中逆时针行走，每10秒完成一个圆圈。走了30秒后，小鸟停止移动和鸣叫，直到它再次上弦。",
	"If the characters ring the silver bell in {@area area M20|33f|x}, they can travel to the palace on the backs of Zybilna's giant cranes, which swoop gracefully over the pinnacles of Yon and gently deposit the characters in the palace garden.

In the Feywild, she raised a magnificent palace and set about establishing herself as the benevolent archfey Zybilna of Prismeer, avatar of mercy for destitute mortals. Her closest allies saw the cracks in her facade, flashes of arrogance and cruelty that conflicted with her kindly persona, but they ascribed this behavior to the mercurial nature of archfey.": "{@creature Iggwilv the Witch Queen|WBtW}创造了Zybilna这个角色来躲避她最讨厌的敌人。在Feywild，她建造了一座宏伟的宫殿，并着手将自己打造成Prismeer的仁慈大公Zybilna，为贫穷的凡人提供怜悯的化身。她最亲密的盟友看到了她表面上的裂缝，看到了与她善良的形象相冲突的傲慢和残忍的闪光，但他们把这种行为归结为大法官的多变性。",
	"Over time, Iggwilv made the mistake of placing too much trust in the hags of the Hourglass Coven, who served in her court as advisors.

	"Iggwilv learned several dark secrets while studying the Abyss, including the ability to summon demons and demonic spirits. But in her quest for absolute power, she made too many enemies and underestimated their determination to destroy her, so she fled to other worlds and across planes to escape the worst of them. She eventually took a page from her mother's book and sequestered herself in the Feywild, where she assumed the guise of an archfey and carved out a spectacular domain for herself. Gradually, Iggwilv transformed into a Fey creature, though she outwardly appears human.

Wrath knows the same information that {@creature Envy|WBtW} knows (see area P9).": "愤怒不喜欢{@creature Envy|WBtW}，但这两个人被Zybilna的魔法阻止了互相伤害。当人物第一次出现在铁蹄面前时，铁蹄要求他们服从并命令他们跪在它面前。如果角色按照愤怒的命令去做，铁蹄就会很高兴，并允许他们留在它面前。未能对它表示敬意的角色会被要求立即离开塔楼，而愤怒会攻击那些拒绝的人。愤怒知道的信息与{@creature Envy|WBtW}知道的信息相同（见区域P9）。",
	"To transform the crown of silver needles from {@area area P8|383|x} into the crown of golden roses, it must be placed on Wrath's brow, but Wrath doesn't know that.

This holds true even if the iron hart is dead.": "要把{@area area P8|383|x}的银针王冠变成金玫瑰王冠，必须把它戴在Wrath的眉心，但Wrath并不知道这一点。当Wrath戴上金冠时，宫殿里所有有hart标记的门都会被解锁（见本章前面的\"{@area Crown Locks|364|x}\"）。即使铁蹄已死也是如此。",
	"Wrath is willing to let the characters take the crown from it temporarily, but it wants something in exchange each time it relinquishes the crown: a basket of berries picked from the palace garden ({@area area P2|36d|x}). If they so desire, the characters can take one of the baskets from the tower and use it to collect the berries. A single character needs 1 hour to pick the berries, but multiple characters working together can reduce the time proportionately. The berries must be presented to Wrath as a gift, whereupon the iron hart devours them. To determine whether Wrath is satisfied, each character who picked any of them can make a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check. On a successful check, the berry selection is deemed acceptable, and Wrath relinquishes the crown. If any character's check total is 25 or higher, the berry selection is deemed extraordinary, and from that point on, Wrath relinquishes the crown whenever the characters ask for it.": "愤怒愿意让角色们暂时从它那里拿走王冠，但它每次放弃王冠时都想得到一些东西作为交换：一篮子从宫殿花园采摘的浆果（{@area area P2|36d|x}）。如果他们愿意，角色们可以从塔上拿一个篮子，用它来收集浆果。一个角色需要1个小时来采摘浆果，但多个角色一起工作可以按比例减少时间。浆果必须作为礼物送给愤怒，然后由铁蹄吞食。为了确定愤怒是否满意，每个采摘它们的角色都可以进行DC15智力（{@skill Nature}）检查。如果检查成功，浆果的选择就被认为是可以接受的，而愤怒则放弃了王冠。如果任何角色的检定总分是25或更高，则浆果选择被视为非同寻常，从那时起，只要角色要求，愤怒就会放弃皇冠。",

Zybilna kept the carriage's magic key inside the vehicle and used {@spell misty step} spells to retrieve it as needed. The carriage's crystal structure is mostly opaque except for its windows. Anyone who looks through a carriage window spots an ornate glass key resting on the seat inside. To reach the key, a character must smash a window or use magic. Characters who smash their way into the carriage alert {@creature Zargash|WBtW} (see {@area area P30|3d0|x}), who investigates the noise.": "齐比尔纳用这辆飞行马车前往费城的其他地方。马车的门是密封的，没有把手、铰链或钥匙孔。Zybilna将马车的魔法钥匙放在车内，并在需要时使用{@spell misty step}法术来取回它。马车的水晶结构大部分是不透明的，除了它的窗户。任何透过马车窗户看的人都会发现里面的座位上放着一把华丽的玻璃钥匙。要拿到这把钥匙，角色必须砸碎窗户或使用魔法。砸进马车的人物会提醒{@creature Zargash|WBtW}（见{@area area P30|3d0|x}），后者会调查这些噪音。",

Turning the key clockwise in the keyhole unlocks both carriage doors and animates the {@creature Glass Pegasus|WBtW|glass pegasi}, causing them to stamp their hooves impatiently. They use the {@creature pegasus} stat block, with these changes:": "如果把钥匙放在马车两侧的门上3英寸以内，门的表面会神奇地出现一个钥匙孔。在钥匙孔中顺时针转动钥匙，可以解锁两边的马车门，并使{@creature Glass Pegasus|WBtW|glass pegasi}产生动画，使它们不耐烦地跺着蹄子。它们使用{@creature pegasus}的状态块，并有这些变化。",

	"Turning the key counterclockwise in either door's lock can be done only while the carriage is on the ground and not moving; doing so locks both doors and causes the pegasi to revert to inanimate glass statues.": "只有当马车在地面上不动时，才能逆时针转动任何一扇门锁的钥匙；这样做可以锁住两扇门，并使小精灵恢复成无生命的玻璃雕像。",
	"Characters can use the carriage to travel beyond Prismeer to other locations in the Feywild, but the carriage and its glass pegasi shatter if the vehicle leaves the Feywild.": "角色可以使用马车超越普利斯米尔前往仙境的其他地方，但如果车辆离开仙境，马车和它的玻璃埙就会破碎。",

A five-foot-wide ledge at floor level circles the room, and a row of five iron levers protrudes from the wall above the ledge on the far side of the room. Five feet below the ledge is the surface of a pool of reeking sludge. Five slender, gilded cages dangle from chains that hang down from holes in the sixty-foot-high ceiling.

	"If the characters parley with {@creature Kelek|WBtW}, he sneers that the palace is now his to rule, though any mention of the Hourglass Coven or the jabberwock causes a flush of dread to pass over {@creature Kelek|WBtW}'s face. Throughout any conversation, {@creature Warduke|WBtW} remains silent, eyeing the party mirthlessly. {@creature Zargash|WBtW}, if present, does as little as possible to help {@creature Kelek|WBtW} without revealing his treasonous heart.

To free {@creature Ringlerun|WBtW}, {@creature Kelek|WBtW} needs a unicorn horn. (He won't explain how the horn works.)

	"The harpsichord is a Medium object with AC 15, 12 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around it. If it loses half or more of its hit points, the harpsichord is too damaged to play music. Reducing the harpsichord to 0 hit points destroys it and causes eight pieces of wreckage to magically spring to life and attack the harpsichord's assailants.

The letters, each of which appear several times, are A, B, I, L, N, Y, and Z. Rearranged, they spell ZYBILNA. Zybilna needed the lettered ornaments as material components for the ritual that created the dretches, but now they are merely decorative distractions for the baby-like dretches.

	"Each dretch is bound by Zybilna's magic and has a speed of 0 feet while in its cradle. If a dretch is removed from its cradle, its disposition doesn't change, but it is free to go where it pleases. It shuns combat and fights only in self-defense. Killing one or more dretches causes an upswell of dark emotions in Iggwilv, which can have consequences for the characters in their climactic encounter with her (as described at the end of the chapter).": "每个弹弓都被Zybilna的魔法所束缚，在摇篮中时速度为0英尺。如果一个弹弓被从摇篮中取出，它的性情不会改变，但它可以自由地去它喜欢的地方。它回避战斗，只在自卫时战斗。杀死一个或更多的dretches会使Iggwilv的黑暗情绪高涨，这可能会对人物与她的高潮相遇产生影响（如本章末尾所述）。",

	"The adventure describes important creatures in detail, while creatures of little consequence get no more than a passing reference. As such, you have enough information to bring important creatures to life, but not so much that it becomes a chore to remember all the details. The adventure seldom goes so far as to describe what a creature sounds like, nor does it reveal everything that a creature might say or do. You're expected to improvise and bring creatures to life as best you can. For example, the adventure describes {@creature Mister Light|WBtW} (one of the owners of the Witchlight Carnival) as a flamboyant figure, but you get to decide what his voice sounds like and how he reacts to a given situation, based on what the adventure says about him. You can also ignore what the text says and roleplay {@creature Mister Light|WBtW} or any other creature as you see fit.": "这个冒险详细描述了重要生物，而对于无关紧要的生物只是简单提及。因此，你可以获得足够的信息来让重要生物栩栩如生，但又不至于记住所有细节成为一种负担。冒险很少描述生物的声音是什么样子，也不会透露生物可能说或做的一切。你需要即兴发挥，尽力让生物栩栩如生。例如，冒险描述了{@creature Mister Light|WBtW}（女巫之光嘉年华的所有者之一）是一个华丽的人物，但你可以决定他的声音是什么样子，以及他如何对待特定情况，根据冒险对他的描述。你也可以忽略文本内容，根据自己的判断扮演{@creature Mister Light|WBtW}或其他生物。",

Over the course of an hour, Burly the bugbear performs feats of strength, Palasha the mermaid serenades the audience from a clamshell bathing pool, Candlefoot the mime plays silent games with audience members, and faerie dragons with bright streamers tied to their tails perform dazzling acts of synchronized flying as a troupe of acrobats, clowns, and fire-breathers parade about. If the characters attempt to disrupt the show, {@creature Mister Light|WBtW} deflects their interruptions with banter and maintains a jovial demeanor.

The will-o'-wisps ask the characters to identify themselves and state their intentions. If the characters express interest in undoing the damage wrought by Bavlorna, the will-o'-wisps are cheerful at the prospect of Bavlorna's ruin.
