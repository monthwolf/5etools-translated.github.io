	"Three hundred years ago, the Cataclysm brought ruin to the world of Krynn. In a single day, an age of wonders came to an end. Countless innocents died, the face of the world was reshaped, and the gods themselves faded into legend. Through ages of struggle, the peoples of Krynn survived, but the world isn't what it was. Those nations that remain linger in the shadows of their ancestors' wonders. Only slowly have they begun to push back centuries of darkness and rediscover how the world has changed.": "三百年前，大灾变给克莱恩世界带来了毁灭。在短短的一天里，一个充满奇迹的时代就这样结束了。无数无辜的人死去，世界的面貌被重塑，而诸神本身也消逝在传说中。经过漫长的斗争，克莱恩的人民幸存下来，但世界已经不是原来的样子。那些留下来的国家在他们祖先的奇迹的阴影下徘徊。只有慢慢地，他们才开始推倒几个世纪的黑暗，重新发现世界是如何改变的。",
	"Then came the Dragon Armies, legions of soldiers devoted to the wicked god Takhisis the Dragon Queen, and the world faces ruin once more. The War of the Lance has begun, and in a conflict between gods and dragons, a wounded world hangs in the balance.": "然后，龙族军队来了，他们是献给邪恶之神龙后塔克西丝的士兵军团，世界再次面临毁灭。长矛战争已经开始，在诸神与龙的冲突中，一个受伤的世界悬而未决。",

	"War is coming—that truth I can no longer deny. Here in Solamnia's eastern reaches, rumors swirl of human-led armies on the march, their ranks swelled by hobgoblins, minotaurs, ogres, and mysterious hooded mercenaries, all seeking a share of the spoils. Our allies in Nordmaar have fallen silent, and desperate travelers say the people of Khur have joined the enemy en masse. Whispers also speak of winged doom, wild reports of riders on dragonnels—and I dare imagine worse.": "战争即将来临--这是我再也无法否认的事实。在索兰尼亚的东部地区，关于人类领导的军队正在行军的传言不绝于耳，他们的队伍中充斥着妖精、牛头人、食人魔和神秘的蒙面雇佣兵，他们都想分得一杯羹。我们在诺德玛尔的盟友已经陷入沉默，绝望的旅行者说库尔的人民已经集体加入了敌人的行列。窃窃私语中还提到了有翅膀的厄运，关于骑龙人的疯狂报道--我敢想象更糟糕的情况。",

Rather than providing an overview of the entire world, the book focuses on the region surrounding the city of Kalaman in the nation of Solamnia as the War of the Lance first reaches its borders. Details of the world and the perils facing Kalaman are presented through this introduction, supplemented by reports from Solamnic scholars and soldiers. Beyond this, the book is divided into the sections below.": "本书通过一场特定冲突的视角，展示了克莱恩世界的一瞥。本书没有对整个世界进行概述，而是在长矛战争首次到达边界时，将重点放在索兰尼亚国卡拉曼城周围的地区。世界的细节和卡拉曼所面临的危险通过这个介绍来呈现，并辅以索兰尼亚学者和士兵的报告。除此以外，本书还分为以下几个部分。",

	"While every world's history is vast and fractured, with missing pieces and forgotten perspectives, Krynn's tale has been shattered by the global catastrophe called the Cataclysm. The world of Krynn was forged and destroyed, yet—broken and scarred—it continued on. Most of its people, seeking merely to survive in their slowly healing lands, care little for eons past. But the sages who piece together fragments of the past focus on three periods: before the Cataclysm, the Cataclysm itself, and the dire age since.": "每个世界的历史都是庞大而断裂的，有缺失的碎片和被遗忘的观点，而克莱恩的故事却被称为大灾变的全球灾难所打破了。克莱恩的世界被锻造和摧毁，但它仍在继续前进，而且伤痕累累。它的大多数人仅仅是为了在他们慢慢愈合的土地上生存，对过去的岁月并不关心。但那些将过去的碎片拼凑在一起的贤者们则专注于三个时期：大灾变之前，大灾变本身，以及大灾变之后的悲惨时代。",
	"Krynn's earliest centuries have passed into mythohistory. The story begins in the Age of Starbirth when the gods forged the world from primordial chaos. This period's records are mere legends and scriptures, and few credit their details as fact.": "Krynn最早的几个世纪已经进入了神话史。故事开始于星辰时代，当时诸神从原始的混沌中铸造了这个世界。这个时期的记录仅仅是传说和经文，很少有人把它们的细节当作事实。",
	"Next came the Age of Dreams, a time when heroes battled the forces of evil. Many modern cultures and institutions saw their origins in this era, including the Knights of Solamnia, the Mages of High Sorcery, and the dwarven kingdom of Thorbardin. Ironically, these cultures often dismiss one another's foundational stories as baseless myths while fiercely insisting on the veracity of their own.": "接下来是梦想时代，这是一个英雄与邪恶力量战斗的时代。许多现代文化和机构都起源于这个时代，包括索兰尼亚骑士团、高阶巫术法师和矮人王国索巴丁。具有讽刺意味的是，这些文化经常将彼此的基础故事视为毫无根据的神话而加以驳斥，同时却激烈地坚持自己的故事的真实性。",
	"During the thousand years before the Cataclysm, known as the Age of Might, several human nations flourished, conquering vast swaths of the continent of Ansalon in the name of good. But the triumph of the Age of Might sowed the seeds of its downfall.": "在大灾变之前的一千年里，也就是所谓的强权时代，几个人类国家蓬勃发展，以善的名义征服了安萨隆大陆的大片土地。但强大时代的胜利却为它的衰落埋下了种子。",
	"Over the centuries, the city of Istar in eastern Ansalon grew into a continent-spanning empire, thanks in part to a military alliance with the Knights of Solamnia. Istar came to be ruled by a series of kingpriests who declared Istar the center of the world and themselves the holy messengers of the gods of good. Under their leadership, Istar declared war on actions, peoples, and even thoughts the kingpriests considered evil. Increasingly rigid and theocratic, Istar reached its apex of power just before its apocalyptic fall. The last kingpriest undertook ever more audacious magical feats, culminating in a ritual to attain godhood and rule Krynn forever in the name of good. At last, the gods acted, united in their condemnation of Istar.": "几个世纪以来，安萨隆东部的伊斯塔城发展成为一个横跨大陆的帝国，这部分归功于与索兰尼亚骑士团的军事联盟。伊斯特城由一系列祭司统治，他们宣称伊斯特城是世界的中心，自己是善神的神圣使者。在他们的领导下，伊斯塔向那些被祭司认为是邪恶的行为、民族、甚至思想宣战。Istar越来越僵化，越来越神权化，在其世界末日来临之前达到了权力的顶峰。最后一位祭司进行了更加大胆的魔法表演，最终在一个仪式中达到了神的地位，并以善的名义永远统治克莱恩。最后，众神采取了行动，联合起来谴责伊斯特。",
	"As a last effort to avoid mass destruction, the gods sent the Thirteen Warnings, a series of signs meant to deter the kingpriest. Trees wept blood, fires raged unnaturally, and cyclones struck the gleaming Temple of the Kingpriest. The gods also warned a few chosen mortals, reasoning that if any of them reached Istar and prevented the ritual, the world might not be beyond redemption. But the messengers failed—the kingpriest and his followers dismissed the warnings as the work of evil and continued on their path. As the hour of the kingpriest's ritual to attain godhood arrived, the gods whisked away their most devout followers and unleashed punishment on all who remained.": "作为避免大规模破坏的最后努力，众神发出了十三条警告，这是一系列旨在威慑王师的迹象。树木泣血，大火不正常地肆虐，旋风袭击了金碧辉煌的王师庙。诸神还警告了一些被选中的凡人，认为如果他们中的任何一个人到达伊斯塔并阻止了仪式，世界可能就不会被救赎。但是信使们都失败了--祭司和他的追随者们将这些警告视为邪恶之举，继续走他们的路。当国王牧师举行成神仪式的时刻到来时，诸神带走了他们最虔诚的追随者，并对所有留下来的人进行了惩罚。",
	"A mountain of fire fell from the sky, destroying Istar. The Blood Sea—a new ocean that split eastern Ansalon—consumed the empire. Coastlines shifted all over the world, sundering nations, drowning whole regions, and stranding ports miles from the sea. Though some lands escaped the worst of the destruction, none were spared divine wrath.": "一座火山从天而降，摧毁了伊斯塔。血海--一个分割安萨隆东部的新海洋，吞噬了整个帝国。世界各地的海岸线都发生了变化，分裂了国家，淹没了整个地区，并将港口搁置在离海数英里的地方。虽然有些地方躲过了最严重的破坏，但没有人能够幸免于神的愤怒。",
	"The gods and their blessings then faded from the world, and in time, even their names were all but forgotten.": "然后，诸神和他们的祝福就从世界上消失了，久而久之，连他们的名字都被遗忘了。",
	"The Cataclysm! It looms larger than any other event in the history of our world, forever dividing time into before and after. Even our calendar reflects this, marking our last four chaotic centuries in years After Cataclysm (AC), while the millennia before, stretching back into shrouded myth, are Pre-Cataclysm (PC).": "大灾变! 它比我们世界历史上的任何其他事件都要大，永远将时间分为之前和之后。甚至我们的日历也反映了这一点，在大灾变（AC）之后的四个混乱的世纪，而之前的几千年，一直延伸到被遮蔽的神话中，是大灾变之前（PC）。",
	"Many records of the time before the Cataclysm are lost to us. Those that do survive are often perplexing, referencing nations and cultures that no longer exist and geography that has changed beyond recognition.": "大灾变之前的许多记录对我们来说已经消失了。那些幸存下来的记录往往令人困惑，提到了不再存在的国家和文化，以及已经改变得面目全非的地理环境。",
	"Still, it is possible to piece these scattered sources together. At the request of the good knights of Maelgoth, here are my notes, compiling a rough introduction to the histories recorded here at the Great Library of Palanthas.": "不过，我们还是有可能将这些零散的资料拼凑起来。应梅尔戈斯的好骑士们的要求，这里是我的笔记，对帕兰萨斯大图书馆这里记录的历史进行了粗略的介绍。",
	"Nikkas of Palanthas, Assistant to the Librarian": "帕兰萨斯的尼卡斯，图书管理员的助理",
	"The Cataclysm ushered in a period of chaos. During the next three centuries, known as the Time of Darkness, cultures and ecologies were radically altered, causing famine, plague, and mass migrations. The Knights of Solamnia, the champions who might've kept Ansalon united, were distrusted as former allies of Istar and persecuted across the continent, even in Solamnia.": "大灾变迎来了一个混乱的时期。在接下来的三个世纪里，也就是所谓的黑暗时期，文化和生态环境被彻底改变，造成了饥荒、瘟疫和大规模移民。索兰尼亚骑士，这些可能使安萨隆保持团结的冠军，作为伊斯塔的前盟友而受到不信任，在整个大陆甚至在索兰尼亚都受到迫害。",
	"The elven nations shut their borders. The dwarves of Thorbardin withdrew to their deep tunnels, refusing entrance to refugees from the surface. Many societies turned on one another or fell to disease and war. Nations of hobgoblins and ogres spread, capitalizing on humanity's decline and claiming whole regions. Much that survived the Cataclysm was lost in darkness.": "精灵族国家关闭了他们的边界。索尔巴丹的矮人撤回了他们的深坑，拒绝来自地面的难民进入。许多社会彼此反目，或倒向疾病和战争。妖精和食人魔的国家蔓延开来，利用人类的衰落，占领了整个地区。在大灾变中幸存下来的许多东西都消失在黑暗中。",
	"At length, the worst effects of the disaster waned. Though many elves and mountain dwarves remained reclusive, other cultures tentatively rebuilt. Explorers ventured forth to map the drastically altered continent. Societies reestablished bonds of trade that united and diversified them.": "渐渐地，灾难的最坏影响减弱了。虽然许多精灵和山地矮人仍然隐居，但其他文化却在试探性地重建。探险家们冒险去绘制这个被彻底改变的大陆。各个社会重新建立了贸易纽带，将他们团结在一起并使之多样化。",
	"As the civilizations of Krynn rebuilt, and new societies arose, the world learned to live with a jarring truth: the gods were truly gone. Religion on Krynn was altered forever. True clerics, who once worked miracles on behalf of their gods, had vanished. While some people remained devout, many others turned to false religions in search of answers and comfort. Some of these new faiths were founded by charlatans, others by zealots. Some claimed the names of the gods, others dismissed them entirely. In this radically changed world bereft of immortal insight, truth became subject to conjecture, even among Krynn's most dedicated scholars.": "随着克莱恩文明的重建和新社会的出现，世界学会了接受一个令人震惊的事实：诸神真的消失了。克莱恩的宗教被永远改变了。曾经代表他们的神明创造奇迹的真正的神职人员已经消失了。虽然有些人仍然很虔诚，但许多人转向了虚假的宗教以寻求答案和安慰。这些新的信仰有些是由骗子建立的，有些是由狂热者建立的。有些人宣称有神的名字，有些人则完全否定了它们。在这个失去了不朽洞察力的彻底改变的世界里，真理成为猜测的对象，即使在克莱恩最敬业的学者中也是如此。",
	"Even as Ansalon healed, a new threat grew. The Dragon Queen Takhisis—known as Tiamat on other worlds—was banished from Krynn over a thousand years ago. Since then, she had waited patiently, plotting her return. Unbeknownst to the other gods, she planted a piece of the kingpriest's ruined temple at Neraka—hidden in the volcanic Taman Busuk region. There it grew into a baleful shadow of Istar's greatest edifice. Though this allowed the Dragon Queen to influence the world through a portal opened there, a fragment of the temple's foundation stone was missing, preventing her from fully returning to the world. She called on the evil dragons who served her, long withdrawn from the world, and began once more to plot the conquest of Krynn.": "即使在安萨隆痊愈的时候，一个新的威胁也在增长。龙后塔克西丝（Takhisis）在其他世界被称为提亚马特（Tiamat），在一千多年前被驱逐出克莱恩。从那时起，她一直耐心地等待着，策划着她的回归。在其他神明不知情的情况下，她在内拉卡（Neraka）种植了一块国王牧师的废墟神庙--隐藏在塔曼布苏克火山地区。在那里，它成长为Istar最伟大的建筑的一个可怕的阴影。虽然这使龙后能够通过在那里打开的门户影响世界，但神庙基石的碎片缺失，使她无法完全返回世界。她召唤了为她服务的恶龙，这些恶龙早已退出了这个世界，并再次开始策划对克莱恩的征服。",
	"Chromatic dragons, acting on their god's orders, stole the eggs of good metallic dragons. The metallic dragons reluctantly pledged to not interfere in the coming war in exchange for the promised safety of their abducted broods.": "色素龙根据他们的神的命令，偷走了好的金属龙的蛋。金属龙不情愿地承诺不干涉即将到来的战争，以换取他们被绑架的孩子的安全承诺。",
	"But the Dragon Queen's servants secretly broke their promises. Takhisis taught her followers to corrupt the stolen eggs into monstrous warriors known as draconians, gambling that draconian armies will conquer Ansalon by the time the metallic dragons learn of this betrayal.": "但龙后的仆人们秘密地违背了他们的承诺。塔克西丝教导她的追随者将偷来的龙蛋腐蚀成被称为龙人的畸形战士，赌的就是当金属龙知道这一背叛时，龙人军队将征服安萨隆。",
	"Unrivaled by gods or dragons, the Dragon Queen unleashes her forces upon a shattered world. In their god's name, these Dragon Armies begin their conquest of Krynn.": "诸神和龙都无法匹敌，龙后将她的力量释放在一个破碎的世界上。以他们神的名义，这些龙族军队开始了对克莱恩的征服。",
	"The Dragon Queen's forces are organized into five Dragon Armies. Draconians fill the ranks of each, though the armies' numbers also include humans, goblins, hobgoblins, ogres, and others who seek wealth and a return to pre-Cataclysm glories. Each Dragon Army is supported by chromatic dragons and their smaller kin, such as dragonnels and wyverns. These winged terrors provide a staggering advantage not seen on battlefields for over a thousand years.": "龙后的部队被组织成五支龙军。龙人充斥着每支军队，尽管军队的人数也包括人类、地精、妖精、食人魔，以及其他寻求财富和恢复大灾变前辉煌的人。每支龙族军队都由色龙和它们较小的亲属支持，如龙巢和狼人。这些长着翅膀的恐怖动物提供了一个在战场上超过千年未见的惊人优势。",
	"The Dragon Queen has elevated her five most cunning and devout followers to the rank of dragon highlord, each commanding one of her armies. The highlords all report to Takhisis's champion, Duulket Ariakas, but there is no shortage of treachery between—and within—the Dragon Armies. The Dragon Queen encourages these conflicts, trusting them to bring the most ruthless and capable leaders to prominence.": "龙女王将她的五个最狡猾、最虔诚的追随者提升为龙族领主，各自指挥着她的一支军队。这些领主都向塔克西丝的冠军杜尔克特-阿里阿卡斯（Duulket Ariakas）报告，但龙族军队之间和内部都不乏背叛行为。龙女王鼓励这些冲突，相信它们会让最无情和最有能力的领导人崭露头角。",
	"The ambitious Highlord Kitiara Uth Matar commands the Blue Dragon Army. Second in power among the Dragon Queen's forces, the Blue Dragon Army prepares to join the Red Dragon Army's multipronged invasion of Solamnia. The Green Dragon Army recently came under the command of Salah-Khan, a Khur leader who united the region's nomads under Dragon Army rule. The half-ogre Lucien of Takar commands the Black Dragon Army, whose focused force supports the other armies and occupies the lands they conquer, including Nordmaar and Goodlund. Finally, the small White Dragon Army is led by Highlord Feal-Thas, a Silvanesti elf and black-robed member of the Mages of High Sorcery.": "雄心勃勃的大领主基蒂亚拉-乌斯-马塔尔指挥着蓝龙军。在龙后的部队中，蓝龙军的实力排名第二，准备加入红龙军对索兰尼亚的多路入侵。绿龙军最近在萨拉赫-汗的指挥下，他是库尔人的领袖，将该地区的游牧民族团结在龙军统治之下。塔卡的半戈尔人卢西恩指挥着黑龙军，其重点部队支持其他军队并占领他们所征服的土地，包括诺德玛尔和古德隆。最后，小规模的白龙军由高阶领主费尔-塔斯（Feal-Thas）领导，他是希尔瓦内斯的精灵和高阶巫术法师的黑袍成员。",

	"The Green Dragon Army was dispatched to the steppes of Khur to subdue the tribes there. Rather than fight a protracted campaign, Ariakas allowed the cunning Khur leader Salah-Khan to defeat the Green Dragon Army's original highlord in battle, then offered to make Salah-Khan highlord in his place. In exchange for control over Khur and the surrounding lands, Salah-Khan accepted and pledged his people to Takhisis, adding to the Dragon Armies' ranks. Few can say whether he did so to further his own ambitions or to spare Khur a long, bloody conflict, but many Khur view Salah-Khan as a traitor to his people and fiercely resist the Green Dragon Army's occupation.": "绿龙军被派往库尔草原，征服那里的部落。阿里阿卡斯没有打一场旷日持久的战役，而是让狡猾的库尔领导人萨拉赫-汗在战斗中击败了绿龙军的原领主，然后提出让萨拉赫-汗代替他成为领主。为了换取对库尔和周围土地的控制权，萨拉赫-汗接受了，并把他的人民交给了塔克西丝，加入了龙军的队伍。很少有人能说清他这样做是为了实现自己的野心，还是为了让库尔避免一场漫长的血腥冲突，但许多库尔人认为萨拉赫-汗是他的人民的叛徒，并激烈地抵制绿龙军的占领。",
	"Without substantial military resistance, Balifor and the Goodlund Peninsula fell to the Black and White Dragon Armies.

	"With virtually all of eastern Ansalon under their control, the Dragon Armies have spent much of the last year regrouping and consolidating their power.

	"Kalaman began as a sleepy fishing village on the coast of the Turbidus Ocean. It might have remained so if not for the arrival of an Istarian trading mission centuries before the Cataclysm. Seeing the potential of a deep harbor so close to the mouth of a great river, the Empire of Istar invested heavily in the town, transforming it into a thriving trade hub. Solamnia soon found Istar's stranglehold on the booming port intolerable, and after a climactic battle on the plains west of the city, Istar ceded control of Kalaman.": "卡拉曼起初是浊海沿岸的一个沉睡的渔村。如果不是因为大灾变前几个世纪一个伊斯塔利亚贸易代表团的到来，它可能一直如此。Istar帝国看到了靠近大河入海口的深水港的潜力，对该镇进行了大量投资，将其改造成一个繁荣的贸易中心。索兰尼亚很快发现伊斯塔对这个蓬勃发展的港口的扼制是无法容忍的，在城市西部的平原上进行了一场高潮迭起的战斗后，伊斯塔放弃了对卡拉曼的控制。",
	"Today, long after the fall of Istar and the trials of the Cataclysm, Kalaman remains a thriving port city surrounded by tall Istarian-built walls that have never been breached. In its busy harbor, vessels from all over Ansalon go about their business under the light of the city's two grand beacons, pre-Cataclysm marvels that have survived for generations. At the center of the city, the ancient Castle Kalaman rises intimidatingly on a sheer hill. The castle's architectural marvels include defenses yet to be recreated in the modern age. The city of Kalaman is further detailed in {@area Chapter 4|16f|x}.": "今天，在伊斯塔的陨落和大灾变的考验之后很久，卡拉曼仍然是一个繁荣的港口城市，周围是伊斯塔利亚人建造的高大城墙，从未被攻破。在繁忙的港口，来自安萨隆各地的船只在城市的两座宏伟灯塔的照耀下开展业务，这些灯塔是大灾变前的奇迹，已经保存了几代人。在城市的中心，古老的卡拉曼城堡令人生畏地耸立在一座陡峭的山上。城堡的建筑奇迹包括尚未在现代重现的防御措施。卡拉曼市的详细情况见{@area Chapter 4|16f|x}。",
	"The city of Kalaman is notably cosmopolitan, while most people in surrounding communities make their livelihood through fishing and farming. Many of the region's inhabitants are Solamnic humans, while others descend from the city's Istarian founders. Traders from all over Ansalon settle in Kalaman through preference or necessity. As a result, some humans hail or have ancestors from Abanasinia, Nordmaar, Ergoth, Estwilde, and farther-flung lands. Kender, hill dwarves, and gnomes are common in the region, while some elves, mountain dwarves, and other people also make their home in the city. Anyone is welcome in Kalaman if they come peaceably with goods to trade.": "卡拉曼市是值得注意的国际大都市，而周围社区的大多数人则以捕鱼和耕作为生。该地区的许多居民都是索兰尼克人，而其他人则是该城市的伊斯特里安创始人的后代。来自安萨隆各地的商人因喜好或需要而在卡拉曼定居。因此，一些人类来自阿巴纳西尼亚、诺德玛尔、埃尔戈特、埃斯特维德以及更远的地方，或者他们的祖先来自这些地方。坎德人、山地矮人和地精在该地区很常见，而一些精灵、山地矮人和其他民族也在该市安家。卡拉曼欢迎任何人，只要他们带着货物和平地前来交易。",
	"To the west of the Kalaman region lies Hinterlund. Even farther west lie the Plains of Solamnia, from where crops and crafted goods make their way to Kalaman for trade. Even in parts of Solamnia closer to the port of Palanthas, it's often cheaper and easier to move goods down the river to Kalaman.": "卡拉曼地区的西部是欣特伦德。更远的西部是索兰尼亚平原，那里的农作物和手工制品都可以运到卡拉曼进行贸易。即使在靠近帕兰萨斯港口的索兰尼亚地区，将货物沿河运到卡拉曼也往往更便宜更容易。",
	"North of Kalaman, the grasslands characteristic of Solamnia give way to the broken steppes and labyrinthine canyons known as the Northern Wastes. Deadly beasts, treacherous cliffs, and unpredictable flooding make the wastes a dangerous land where it's said nothing survives for long.": "在卡拉曼以北，索兰尼亚特有的草原让位于被称为北方荒原的破碎大草原和迷宫般的峡谷。致命的野兽、险恶的悬崖和不可预知的洪水使荒原成为一片危险的土地，据说在这里没有什么东西可以长期生存。",
	"East of Kalaman, the lands of Estwilde hold inhospitable terrain and peoples who have been unfriendly to Solamnia since the days of Istar. Across the bay in northern Estwilde lie the swamps of Qwalmish. To the south and east of Kalaman are the rolling steppes of Qlettaar, which in turn give way to the forbidding peaks of the Taman Busuk region beyond Estwilde.": "在卡拉曼的东部，埃斯特维尔德的土地拥有荒凉的地形和自伊斯塔时代就对索兰尼亚不友好的人民。在埃斯特维尔德北部的海湾对面，是奎尔米什的沼泽地。在卡拉曼的南部和东部，是Qlettaar连绵不断的大草原，而这些大草原又让位于埃斯特威尔德以外的塔曼-布苏克地区的险峻山峰。",
	"For generations, the Soths of Dargaard Keep—a family of Knights of Solamnia—ruled the Solamnic province once known as Knightlund. Before the Cataclysm, the gods of good forewarned Knightlund's leader, Lord Loren Soth, about the coming destruction and offered him a chance to stop it, but he failed to accomplish this task. Since then, the province has had a cursed reputation. People have come to know the land as Nightlund and ascribe the region's frequent storms to the old gods' disfavor.": "几代人以来，达尔加德堡的索斯家族--一个索兰尼亚的骑士家族--统治着曾经被称为奈特伦德的索兰尼亚省。在大灾变之前，善神向奈特伦德的领袖洛伦-索斯大人发出了即将到来的毁灭的警告，并给了他一个阻止毁灭的机会，但他没能完成这个任务。从那时起，该省就有了一个被诅咒的声誉。人们将这片土地称为Nightlund，并将该地区频繁发生的风暴归咎于旧神的不喜欢。",

	"The gods of Krynn are said to have abandoned the world, and in the great cities of Ansalon, temples and centers of faith are few. Nevertheless, small miracles occur across the world. Druids and hidden communities offer prayers in the old ways and employ mysterious magic. Long-lived peoples remember the worship of the gods and see their shapes in nature and the constellations above. Ancient, forgotten sanctuaries hold wonders beyond imagination, and divine whispers reach those with the minds and hearts to listen. The gods haven't wholly abandoned Krynn, and as threats grow, mortals turn to them once more—sometimes after a remarkable encounter with a messenger of the gods.": "据说克莱恩的众神已经抛弃了这个世界，在安萨隆的大城市中，寺庙和信仰中心很少。尽管如此，小的奇迹还是在世界各地发生。德鲁伊和隐藏的社区以古老的方式提供祈祷，并运用神秘的魔法。长寿的人们记得对神的崇拜，并在自然界和上方的星座中看到他们的形状。古老的、被遗忘的圣地拥有超乎想象的奇迹，神圣的低语传到那些有思想和心灵的人那里。诸神并没有完全抛弃克莱恩，随着威胁的增加，凡人再次转向他们--有时是在与诸神的信使有了非凡的接触之后。",
	"The gods of Krynn loosely align with one another along the principles of good, neutrality, and evil.

Betrayed and hungry, these surface dwarves allied with other desperate refugees and unsuccessfully attempted to take Thorbardin by force. The conflict that came to be called the Dwarfgate War caused deep enmity between the dwarven communities of the surface and those that live below.": "索尔巴丹的矮人以古老的部族划分。在大灾变之前的许多世代，居住在地表的矮人建立了尼达尔部族，以耕种土地和与其他地表居民进行贸易而闻名。在大灾变之后，由于食物匮乏和未来的不确定性，索尔巴丹的大王封住了王国的大门，禁止所有外来者进入，包括尼达尔人。在被背叛和饥饿的情况下，这些地表矮人与其他绝望的难民结盟，试图用武力夺取索尔巴丹，但未获成功。这场被称为 \"矮人之门战争 \"的冲突在地表的矮人社区和地下的矮人社区之间引起了深深的敌意。",

	"Over two thousand years ago, the Kinslayer War divided the high elves of Ansalon into two groups, Silvanesti in the east and Qualinesti in the west. Through the intervening millennia, neither group has sought reconciliation.

	"As the elves of Ansalon largely keep to themselves, half-elves are few and are rarely seen outside the elven nations.": "由于安萨隆的精灵们大多独来独往，半身人很少，在精灵国家之外也很少见到。",
	"Silvanesti, the original elven kingdom, lies in southern Ansalon. For untold generations, the aloof Silvanesti elves lived in a stratified society closed to outsiders. They don't hate their cousins in Qualinesti, but they consider their ways misguided.": "希尔瓦娜斯提，最初的精灵王国，位于安萨隆南部。无数代以来，冷漠的希尔瓦娜斯蒂精灵生活在一个对外人封闭的分层社会中。他们并不恨他们在奎林斯提的表亲，但他们认为他们的方式是错误的。",
	"In recent years, war has come to Silvanesti. When the Dragon Armies besieged the realm, the leader Lorac Caladon, Speaker of the Stars, ordered his people to evacuate. Lorac then attempted to defend the kingdom with an {@item orb of dragonkind}—but the artifact's magic unexpectedly warped Silvanesti into a nightmarish land. The surviving elves of Silvanesti now find themselves a people without a homeland. Most journeyed together across the sea to Southern Ergoth, seeking refuge with the Kagonesti, while others refused to give up Silvanesti and sought to reclaim their ancestral home.": "近年来，战争来到了希尔瓦内斯。当龙族军队围攻这个王国时，领袖Lorac Caladon，星星的发言人，命令他的人民撤离。然后，洛拉克试图用一个{@item orb of dragonkind}来保卫王国--但这个神器的魔法意外地将希尔瓦内斯蒂扭曲成一个噩梦般的土地。希尔瓦娜斯提幸存的精灵们现在发现自己是一个没有祖国的民族。大多数人一起渡海到南尔戈斯，向卡贡斯蒂人寻求庇护，而其他人则拒绝放弃希尔瓦娜斯蒂，并试图夺回他们的祖先家园。",
	"As a Silvanesti high elf, you know what few in Ansalon do: the home of the elves has fallen. During the Dragon Armies' invasion of Silvanesti, you might have been separated from your people or even taken captive before escaping the Dragon Armies in unfamiliar lands.

Or perhaps you've spent your life exploring the world, cultivating relationships with people other than your kin.": "作为一个希尔瓦娜斯提的高等精灵，你知道安萨隆中很少有人知道的事情：精灵的家园已经沦陷。在龙族军队入侵希尔瓦娜斯提的过程中，你可能与你的人民分离，甚至被俘虏，然后在陌生的土地上逃离龙族军队。你可能已经和你的人民一起逃离了希尔瓦娜斯提，但现在寻求恢复你的家园的方法。或者你一生都在探索世界，与你的亲属以外的人培养关系。",
	"Long ago, a group of high elves left Silvanesti, desiring a more egalitarian society. They traveled far to the west and founded a new forested homeland called Qualinesti. Less hierarchical than their progenitors and more willing to deal with outsiders, Qualinesti elves even enjoyed good relations with the dwarves of Thorbardin. Since the Cataclysm, however, they've withdrawn from the world, and few outsiders dare approach their well-guarded borders.": "很久以前，一群高等精灵离开了希尔瓦内斯蒂，渴望一个更加平等的社会。他们远赴西方，建立了一个新的森林家园，叫做奎林斯蒂。与他们的祖先相比，奎林斯蒂的等级制度较少，而且更愿意与外来者打交道，奎林斯蒂的精灵们甚至与索尔巴丹的矮人保持着良好的关系。然而，自从大灾变以来，他们已经从这个世界上撤走了，很少有外人敢接近他们守卫森严的边界。",
	"As a Qualinesti high elf, you might have been raised in seclusion in the forests of Qualinesti.

	"Kagonesti are the descendants of elves who never settled in the forest cities of Silvanesti, instead living a nomadic way of life and seeking harmony with nature. Most of these wood elves live in small tribes in the forests of Southern Ergoth.

While the Kagonesti welcome their cousins and seek to support them, they refuse to be overwhelmed by the Silvanesti's numbers and distinct ways.": "卡贡斯蒂是精灵的后裔，他们从未在希尔瓦内斯蒂的森林城市定居，而是以游牧的方式生活，寻求与自然的和谐。这些木精灵大多以小部落的形式生活在埃尔戈斯南部的森林中。虽然很少有外人闯入卡贡斯蒂人古老的森林土地，但成千上万的希尔瓦内斯蒂难民已经开始寻求他们的帮助。虽然卡冈尼斯人欢迎他们的表亲并寻求支持，但他们拒绝被希尔瓦内斯人的数量和独特的方式所淹没。",
	"As a Kagonesti wood elf, you likely spent a great deal of your life in the forest and know much about the natural world.

	"Two groups of sea elves inhabit the oceans surrounding Ansalon. Dargonesti, also known as deep elves, call the vast oceans home. Their cousins, Dimernesti, are often called shoal elves. Although Dimernesti live closer to land, they have deep bonds with the sea and all life within. Both groups of sea elves are rarely seen by the peoples of Ansalon and keep to their own aquatic communities.

Originally put forth by Vinas Solamnus as an organizational scheme and code of conduct for the knightly orders, the Measure grew over the years to encompass thirty-seven volumes, covering everything from courtly etiquette to the proper saddling of mounts.

	"Often reviled and feared in equal measure, the Black Robes follow the example of the evil god Nuitari, the black moon of Krynn.

	"Thousands of years ago, the Mages of High Sorcery cooperated to build five Towers of High Sorcery, centers of learning to advance the craft of magic and the interests of the orders.

Some order members hunt renegades, seeking to punish or slay those who've defied the Mages of High Sorcery.": "如果一个施法者离开或被赶出高阶巫术法师组织，或者他们没有通过高阶巫术测试而存活下来，该组织的领导者就会禁止他们继续练习魔法。蔑视协约组织而练习魔法的法师被视为叛徒。长袍骑士团的成员有义务举报和反对这些叛徒。有些教团成员会追捕叛徒，试图惩罚或杀死那些蔑视高阶巫术法师的人。",

	"For hundreds of years, the world of Krynn has been bereft of those who call upon the favor of the gods. Legends say deities turned away from the world after the Cataclysm, and the prayers of the few who remember them have been met with silence ever since. But that silence is now being broken. A chosen few hear the call of the gods and awaken to their power. This prelude suits characters who hear that calling and respond to it.": "数百年来，克莱恩的世界已经没有了那些呼唤众神青睐的人。传说中，在大灾变之后，神灵们远离了这个世界，而少数记得他们的人的祈祷也从那时起以沉默告终。但这种沉默现在正在被打破。少数被选中的人听到了众神的召唤，并唤醒了他们的力量。这个前奏适合那些听到这种召唤并对其作出反应的人物。",
	"The prelude unfolds in a surreal, dreamlike situation where characters can follow a divine calling to learn about their deity's goals and become one of their chosen. You may alter any of this prelude's elements to better match individual gods' virtues and identities.": "序幕在一个超现实的梦境中展开，人物可以听从神的召唤，了解他们神的目标，并成为他们选中的一员。你可以改变这个前奏的任何元素，以更好地配合个别神灵的美德和身份。",
	"Before you begin, make sure any players involved have chosen gods for their characters. Krynn's deities and their provinces are listed in this book's {@area introduction|01c|x}.": "在你开始之前，确保所有参与的玩家都为他们的角色选择了神灵。Krynn的神祗和他们的省份在本书的{@area introduction|01c|x}中列出。",
	"This prelude focuses on characters who have been experiencing a recurring vision that comes to them in times of great turmoil or doubt. This vision might be a recent occurrence or something they've been experiencing for a long time, possibly since childhood.": "这篇序言关注的是那些一直在经历一种反复出现的异象的人物，这种异象在巨大的动荡或怀疑的时候出现在他们身上。这种异象可能是最近发生的，也可能是他们长期以来一直在经历的，可能是从童年开始。",
	"The read-aloud text below describes such a vision. You can add details that correspond to each character's deity. For example, a character who worships Sirrion might find the surrounding forest aflame, while a character called by Paladine might notice the fallen soldier's eyes turning into pools of silver.": "下面的朗读文本描述了这样一个异象。你可以根据每个角色的神性添加细节。例如，崇拜Sirrion的角色可能会发现周围的森林在燃烧，而被Paladine召唤的角色可能会注意到死去的士兵的眼睛变成了银色的池子。",
	"Read or paraphrase the following text to describe the vision the characters have been having:": "阅读或转述以下文字，描述人物一直以来的愿景。",
	"You stand at the center of a forest clearing. Clashing steel echoes from the thicket beyond. As you look around, you realize piles of bodies cover the ground. One of the fallen clutches something against their chest. You're not sure what it is, but you feel the urge to reach for it. Before you can, the object glows and then flashes with intense light.": "你站在一片森林空地的中心。灌木丛中回荡着钢铁的碰撞声。当你环顾四周时，你发现地面上堆满了尸体。其中一个倒下的人紧紧抓住胸前的东西。你不确定那是什么，但你感到有一种冲动想去拿它。在你伸手之前，那东西发着光，然后闪烁着强烈的光。",
	"The characters wake after having the vision and find nothing out of the ordinary. They realize the object in the vision was an amulet. The amulet bears a design they might not recognize, but is the symbol of the god the character's player chose during character creation. The echoes of battle don't mean anything in particular to the characters but feel like a bad omen.": "人物在出现幻觉后醒来，没有发现任何异常。他们意识到异象中的物体是一个护身符。护身符上有一个他们可能不认识的图案，但它是角色的玩家在创建角色时选择的神的象征。战斗的回声对人物来说没有什么特别的意义，但感觉像是一个坏兆头。",
	"Prior to the vision, the characters were traveling to Vogler and had stopped to camp or rest near a forested path. After experiencing the vision, the characters wake to find their camp sacked and some of their belongings missing. The characters are the only creatures in the camp; no one else who might have been traveling with them is in sight.": "在出现异象之前，这些人物正在前往沃格勒，并在一条林间小路附近停下来扎营或休息。在经历了异象之后，人物醒来发现他们的营地被洗劫一空，他们的一些物品也不见了。他们是营地里唯一的生物；没有看到其他可能与他们一起旅行的人。",
	"A character who examines the surroundings finds a trail of food, cloth, and discarded trinkets that leads into the brush. A few hundred feet away, the characters find their belongings discarded in the middle of the forest. Nothing is missing or damaged. There is no sign of what brought the characters' possessions here.": "一个检查周围环境的人物发现了一条食物、布匹和被丢弃的小饰品的痕迹，它通向灌木丛中。在几百英尺外，人物发现他们的物品被丢弃在森林中间。没有任何东西丢失或损坏。没有迹象表明是什么东西把人物的财物带到了这里。",
	"Among their belongings, the characters find an item that closely matches the amulet from their visions. As in the vision, the characters might feel inexplicably drawn to the item. If the characters have different gods, they each find a holy symbol for their chosen deity. As soon as a character touches the amulet, a pulse of divine energy ripples from them, causing the amulet to vanish from their hands. The pulse flattens the surrounding vegetation, creating an unnatural clearing similar to the one in the characters' visions. The cleared plants also reveal overgrown ruins nearby:": "在他们的物品中，人物发现了一件与他们幻觉中的护身符密切相关的物品。就像在异象中一样，人物可能会感到莫名其妙地被这个物品吸引。如果角色们有不同的神，他们就各自找到一个他们所选择的神的神圣符号。当一个角色接触到护身符时，一股神圣的能量脉冲从他们身上荡漾开来，使护身符从他们手中消失。脉冲将周围的植被夷为平地，创造出一个非自然的空地，与人物幻觉中的空地相似。被清除的植物还显示出附近杂草丛生的废墟。",
	"A crumbling stone structure lies among the undergrowth. Its roof is pierced by the trunk of an immense tree, but its walls are mostly intact. A large, empty doorframe leads inside.": "一座摇摇欲坠的石质结构躺在灌木丛中。它的屋顶被一棵大树的树干刺穿，但它的墙壁基本完好。一个大而空的门框通往里面。",
	"Characters who don't approach the ruin feel supernaturally drawn toward the place, as if a familiar voice were calling their name. As characters approach the door, they hear faint voices inside.": "没有接近废墟的角色会感到超自然地被吸引到这个地方，就像一个熟悉的声音在叫他们的名字。当人物接近门时，他们听到里面有微弱的声音。",
	"Read the following text when the characters enter the ruin:": "当人物进入废墟时，阅读以下文字。",
	"The tree visible from outside breaks through the ruin's marble floor and stretches through the collapsed ceiling. Around it, broken statues line the remaining walls, standing in crumbling alcoves.": "从外面可以看到的那棵树冲破了废墟的大理石地板，延伸到坍塌的天花板上。在它周围，残破的雕像在剩余的墙壁上排列，站在摇摇欲坠的凹槽里。",
	"The statues were once larger-than-life depictions of several of Krynn's deities, but most of them are ruined. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check can identify as many of the statues as you deem appropriate. The character instantly recognizes the statue of the god whose symbol they just found.": "这些雕像曾经是对克莱恩的几个神灵的栩栩如生的描绘，但大部分都被毁了。通过DC12智力({@skill Religion})检查成功的角色可以识别你认为合适的雕像。这个角色会立刻认出他们刚刚发现的那个神像的标志。",
	"Soon after the characters enter the room, a faint glow begins emanating from the statue of the god whose symbol they just discovered. The glow coalesces around the ruined statue, creating a spectral semblance of what the statue looked like in the past. Depending on its nature, the holy symbol might also appear somewhere on or near the statue, perhaps held or worn by it. If the characters have different gods, this happens to multiple statues.": "在人物进入房间后不久，一个微弱的光芒开始从他们刚刚发现的那个神的雕像上散发出来。光芒在破败的雕像周围凝聚起来，形成了雕像过去的样子的幽灵状。根据其性质，神圣的符号也可能出现在雕像上或附近的某个地方，也许是由它持有或佩戴。如果人物有不同的神，这种情况会发生在多个雕像上。",
	"Once a character approaches the statue of their deity, they hear that deity's voice in their thoughts. The deity invites the character to take the holy symbol and become their herald in the world. Use the details on Krynn's deities from the {@area introduction|01c|x} to roleplay the deity. The deity wants the character to carry their power and divine message into the world now—when Krynn needs it most. The god won't elaborate on why they chose the character or why they're revealing themself now. This brief conversation allows characters to learn as much as you deem necessary about their gods, and it ends with the characters gaining access to any god-granted spells and divine class features.": "一旦一个角色接近他们的神像，他们就会在思想中听到神的声音。神灵邀请角色拿着神圣的标志，成为他们在这个世界上的传令官。使用{@area introduction|01c|x}中关于克莱恩神灵的详细资料来扮演神灵。神灵希望角色现在就把他们的力量和神圣的信息带到世界上--在克莱恩最需要它的时候。神灵不会详细说明他们为什么选择这个角色，也不会说明他们为什么现在要显露自己。这个简短的对话允许角色尽可能多地了解他们的神灵，并以角色获得任何神赐的法术和神级特征而结束。",
	"As soon as the characters exit and leave sight of the temple, the structure vanishes.": "当人物退出并离开寺庙的视线时，该结构就消失了。",
	"The characters find no trace of any disturbance in their camp. If they were traveling with anyone else, their companions are waiting for them when they return. Any fellow travelers didn't notice the characters leaving the camp and have no recollection of anything strange happening.": "这些人物在他们的营地里没有发现任何干扰的痕迹。如果他们和其他人一起旅行，当他们回来时，他们的同伴正在等待他们。任何同行者都没有注意到人物离开营地，也不记得有什么奇怪的事情发生。",
	"Any attempt to return to the ruined temple fails, as if it was never there.": "任何返回废墟寺庙的尝试都会失败，仿佛它从未出现过。",
	"The Mages of High Sorcery harness the magical power of the three moons of Krynn: Solinari the White, Lunitari the Red, and Nuitari the Black. Those blessed by the moons might show talent for magic and, with proper training, become apprentice mages. But to be accepted into one of the robed orders, a mage must officially join the Mages of High Sorcery and be subjected to the Test of High Sorcery, wherein their dedication to the magical arts is challenged. Failing the test can be deadly, but those who dare to seek magical power without passing the test are branded renegades and enemies of the Mages of High Sorcery.": "高等巫术法师掌握着克莱恩三个月亮的魔法力量：白之月Solinari、红之月Lunitari和黑之月Nuitari。那些受到月亮祝福的人可能会显示出魔法的天赋，并通过适当的训练，成为法师学徒。但是要想被长袍教团接受，法师必须正式加入高阶巫术法师，并接受高阶巫术测试，在测试中他们对魔法艺术的奉献受到了挑战。未能通过测试可能是致命的，但那些敢于在未通过测试的情况下寻求魔法力量的人被打成叛徒和高阶法师的敌人。",
	"The prelude focuses on characters who are apprentice spellcasters aspiring to take the Test of High Sorcery. Characters of any background are welcome, but the focal characters must be able to cast spells. Spellcasting characters with no interest in joining the Mages of High Sorcery might participate in the \"{@area Scales of War|0cb|x}\" prelude instead.": "前奏的重点是那些渴望参加高阶巫术测试的法术学徒角色。我们欢迎任何背景的人物，但重点人物必须能够施法。对加入高阶巫术法师没有兴趣的施法者可以参加\"{@area Scales of War|0cb|x} \"序幕。",
	"Every year and a half, the moons of Krynn align in an event known as the Night of the Eye. This prelude unfolds during one of these fateful nights, shortly before the characters head to Vogler.": "每隔一年半，克莱恩的月亮就会在一个被称为 \"眼睛之夜 \"的事件中排列起来。这个序幕就是在其中一个决定性的夜晚展开的，就在人物前往沃格勒的前不久。",
	"The prelude happens at the Barb, a centuries-old spire where promising apprentice mages go to test their magic. The Barb is located anywhere in the world that befits your story. It was built before the Cataclysm by the Mages of High Sorcery, but its intended purpose is lost to time. Many extradimensional spaces within it remain active, though they're accessible only during the Night of the Eye.": "前奏发生在 \"倒刺\"，一个有几百年历史的尖塔，有前途的法师学徒会去那里测试他们的魔法。倒刺位于世界上任何适合你的故事的地方。它是在大灾变之前由高阶法师建造的，但是它的目的已经被时间所遗忘。它里面的许多次元空间仍然是活跃的，尽管它们只有在 \"眼睛之夜 \"才能进入。",
	"The prelude begins with the characters nearing the Barb:": "前奏以人物接近 \"倒刺 \"开始。",
	"Tonight is an important night. Ahead rises the Barb: a jagged, half-ruined spire of gray stone. Many who aspire to join the Mages of High Sorcery have come here to prove their magical proficiency. The Barb is usually nothing more than a ruin, its construction predating the Cataclysm. But tonight, on the Night of the Eye, when Krynn's three moons align, the ruin is alive with magic once more. Soft light shines from the archway leading into the structure.": "今晚是一个重要的夜晚。前方耸立着 \"倒刺\"：一个参差不齐的、半毁的灰色石头尖顶。许多有志于加入高阶巫术法师的人都来到这里，以证明他们的魔法能力。倒刺通常只不过是个废墟，它的建造早于大灾变。但是今晚，在克莱恩的三个月亮一致的 \"眼睛之夜\"，这个废墟再次充满了魔法的活力。柔和的光线从通往建筑的拱门处照耀出来。",
	"The characters know that they're here to participate in a test and that if they succeed, they'll learn the next steps to joining the Mages of High Sorcery. They also know any of the information from this prelude's introduction.": "这些人物知道他们在这里是为了参加一个测试，如果他们成功了，他们将学习加入高阶巫术法师的下一个步骤。他们也知道本序幕介绍中的任何信息。",
	"When the characters enter the Barb, read the following description to set the scene:": "当人物进入 \"倒刺 \"时，请阅读以下描述，以设定场景。",
	"The arch opens into a large atrium lit with flaming sconces and adorned by grand tapestries depicting Krynn's three moons. Doors circle the room. The light of the moons cascades through broad windows high above. At the center of the room stands a serene-looking woman with long, gray hair and red robes. She nods as you enter.": "拱门通向一个大的中庭，里面有火红的壁灯，并有描绘克莱恩三个月亮的大挂毯装饰。门环绕着房间。月亮的光芒透过高处的宽大窗户洒落下来。在房间的中心，站着一个长着灰色长发、身穿红色长袍、面容安详的女人。你进来时她点了点头。",
	"The red-robed mage is named Rovina, and she serves as the Barb's caretaker. She welcomes the characters to the atrium. She explains that the Barb is a place of ancient power where, during the Night of the Eye, magic flares to life to test would-be mages. Rovina also answers any questions the characters have about the {@area Mages of High Sorcery|067|x} (as detailed in {@adventure chapter 1|DSotDQ|1}).": "红袍法师名叫罗维纳，她是 \"倒刺 \"的看守人。她欢迎这些人物来到中庭。她解释说，\"倒刺 \"是一个拥有古老力量的地方，在 \"眼睛之夜\"，魔法会在这里爆发，以测试未来的法师。罗维纳还回答了人物关于{@area Mages of High Sorcery|067|x}的任何问题（详见{@adventure chapter 1|DSotDQ|1}）。",
	"Characters who examine the tapestries recognize each of the three moons and their relation to the three orders of the Mages of High Sorcery.": "检查挂毯的人物会认出三个月亮中的每一个，以及它们与高级巫术法师的三个等级的关系。",
	"Rovina leads the characters to a door and shares the following information:": "罗维纳带领人物来到一扇门前，分享了以下信息。",

	"The trial requires magical talent but carries none of the dangers of the Test of High Sorcery. It provides a foundation for the real test.": "这个试验需要魔法天赋，但没有高级巫术测试的危险性。它为真正的测试打下了基础。",
	"The goal is to complete the challenge presented in the room, implying different apprentices will face different challenges.": "目标是完成房间里提出的挑战，这意味着不同的学徒将面临不同的挑战。",

Atop the pedestal, an ornate key balances on its tip.": "门打开后是一个宽大的圆形大厅，黑色的石头地板和墙壁上雕刻着精致的符文。室内空无一人，只有房间中央的一个基座。在基座上，一把华丽的钥匙在其顶端平衡。",
	"Behind you, the door you entered through vanishes. On the opposite side of the room, an identical, closed door appears.": "在你身后，你进来的那扇门消失了。在房间的另一侧，出现了一扇相同的、封闭的门。",

The door is locked and can be opened only by the key at the center of the rotunda or by casting the {@spell knock} spell on the door.": "这个房间的直径为100英尺，在人物对面的墙上有一扇门，中心是基座。这扇门是锁着的，只有通过圆形大厅中央的钥匙或对门施展{@spell knock}的咒语才能打开。",
	"If the characters move more than 5 feet toward the pedestal, they run into an invisible wall. The wall extends to the ceiling and is part of an invisible, shifting maze that the characters must traverse to reach the key at the center. The maze is 90 feet in diameter, leaving a 5-foot gap between it and the rotunda's walls.": "如果人物向基座移动超过5英尺，他们就会碰到一堵看不见的墙。这堵墙一直延伸到天花板，是一个无形的、可移动的迷宫的一部分，人物必须穿越这个迷宫才能到达中心的钥匙。迷宫的直径为90英尺，与圆形大厅的墙壁之间留有5英尺的间隙。",
	"The carvings on the wall around the rotunda are magical runes. A character who examines the carvings learns their meaning by succeeding on a DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check or by spending an hour studying them. The runes are an arcane cipher for the {@spell knock} spell. Reading the spell from the wall allows a character to cast the spell as if they were casting it from a {@item spell scroll} of {@spell knock}, except the spell on the wall isn't consumed. The characters can use this spell to open the door and complete the test.": "圆形大厅周围墙壁上的雕刻是神奇的符文。检查这些符文的人可以通过DC14智力({@skill Arcana})检查成功或花一小时研究它们来了解它们的含义。这些符文是{@spell knock}法术的奥术密码。从墙上读取咒语，可以让角色像从{@item spell scroll}的{@spell knock}施法一样施法，只是墙上的咒语不会被消耗。角色可以使用这个咒语来打开门，完成测试。",
	"Touching the key at the center causes the walls of the maze to vanish. The key can then be used to open the locked door. The key vanishes once it is used.": "触摸中心的钥匙会使迷宫的墙壁消失。然后可以用这把钥匙来打开锁着的门。钥匙一旦被使用就会消失。",
	"Upon completing the trial and passing through the door, the characters emerge into the atrium of the Barb. Rovina congratulates them on passing the challenge and deems their apprenticeship complete. They are now ready to take the next step on the path to becoming members of the Mages of High Sorcery.": "在完成试验并通过门后，人物出现在 \"倒刺 \"的中庭里。罗维纳祝贺他们通过了挑战，并认为他们的学徒生涯结束了。他们现在已经准备好在成为高阶巫术法师的道路上迈出下一步了。",

	"If the draconians notice the characters, the kapak draconian orders two of the baaz draconians to attack, then slips away with the other two into the surrounding forest. The baaz draconians are battered from the fight with the knights and have half their normal hit points.

	"Shortly after the draconians are defeated, Rhys rejoins the characters and asks them what those monsters were. He has no idea, and the characters likely don't either. This is one of the first times draconians have made their way into Solamnia, but it won't be the last.": "在龙人被打败后不久，瑞斯重新加入了这些角色，并问他们那些怪物是什么。他不知道，角色们可能也不知道。这是龙人第一次进入索兰尼亚，但这不会是最后一次。",

	"At the edge of the Solamnic province of Hinterlund lies the quiet fishing village of Vogler. Home to humans, kender, and hill dwarves, Vogler is the last stop on the road to nowhere. To the village's north, scattered woods and shady brooks give way to the deadly badlands known as the Northern Wastes. Across the Vingaard River to the south stretches a land of grim legends and opportunity: the province of Nightlund, whose nearby port of Kalaman welcomes traders from long-forgotten lands. Vogler's people know little of the evil afoot in the world. On the day the characters arrive, the people of Vogler are concerned with two things: kicking off the annual Kingfisher Festival and putting a local hero to rest.": "在辛特伦德的索拉姆尼克省的边缘，有一个安静的渔村沃格勒。沃格勒是人类、坎德人和山地矮人的家园，是通往不归路的最后一站。在村子的北部，零星的树林和阴暗的小溪让位于被称为北方荒原的致命坏境。穿过文加德河，向南延伸出一片充满残酷传说和机遇的土地：夜郎省，其附近的卡拉曼港欢迎来自被遗忘已久的土地的商人。沃格勒的人民对这个世界上的邪恶知之甚少。在人物到达的那一天，沃格勒的人们只关心两件事：启动一年一度的翠鸟节和让当地的英雄安息。",

	"The fishing village of Vogler clings to a spit of land reaching into the Vingaard River. Wooded cliffs overlook the community, and the only path from the north descends past the ivy-covered remnants of a crumbling stone keep. The village's modest wooden buildings cluster around a quaint central circle and along the riverbank.": "沃格勒渔村紧贴着伸入文加德河的一片土地。树木茂盛的悬崖俯瞰着这个社区，从北边走来的唯一一条小路，经过了被常春藤覆盖的破败石堡的残骸。村子里简陋的木制建筑围绕着一个古朴的中心圈和河岸而建。",
	"Jutting into the river—out of place and seemingly out of time—stands an incomplete stone bridge of incredible artisanship. The structure clearly dates to before the Cataclysm, eclipsing its modern peers in size and sturdiness. The bridge crosses less than half the river's width before giving way to a series of ropes and tethered rafts serving as ferries.": "一座不完整的石桥矗立在河中，它的位置和时间似乎都不在这里，它的艺术性令人难以置信。这个结构显然可以追溯到大灾变之前，其规模和坚固程度让现代的同行们黯然失色。这座桥穿过不到一半的河面，然后让位于一系列作为渡船的绳索和拴住的木筏。",
	"On the river itself, dozens of small boats drift along the slow, murky waters as the fishers of Vogler ply their trade.": "在河上，几十条小船在缓慢而浑浊的水面上漂流，沃格勒的渔民们正在从事他们的贸易。",

Individuals or small groups could peruse the market, observe villagers preparing for the Kingfisher Festival, or find the rooms that—per their invitations—await them at the Brass Crab.": "人物可以随心所欲地探索沃格勒。个人或小团体可以逛市场，观察村民们为翠鸟节做准备，或者在铜蟹餐厅找到等待他们的房间--根据他们的邀请函。",
	"The characters' visit to Vogler overlaps with the kickoff of the Kingfisher Festival, an annual celebration commemorating Solamnia's victory over the forces of Istar during a clash near the town centuries ago. The festival takes its name from the kingfisher, a symbol of the Knights of Solamnia and a bird the fishers of Vogler consider lucky. Festivities culminate with the locals' reenactment of the Battle of High Hill, a clash between Istarian and Solamnic soldiers.": "角色们对沃格勒的访问与翠鸟节的开幕相重合，这是一个一年一度的庆祝活动，纪念索兰尼亚在几个世纪前在该镇附近的冲突中战胜了伊斯塔的军队。这个节日的名字来自于翠鸟，它是索兰尼亚骑士团的象征，也是沃格勒的渔民们认为的幸运之鸟。节日的高潮是当地人重演高山之战，这是伊斯塔利亚和索拉姆尼亚士兵之间的冲突。",
	"While in Vogler, the characters might visit any of the locations in this section. These sites are marked on map 3.1.": "在沃格勒的时候，人物可能会访问本节中的任何地点。这些地点在地图3.1上都有标记。",
	"High Hill stands a mile north of Vogler. Centuries ago, Solamnic and Istarian forces clashed here, and legends claim the spirits of fallen knights haunt the hill and watch over the town. Each year, the Kingfisher Festival's reenactment of the battle serves as a reminder of the village's history and nominally honors any spirits lingering at the battlefield.": "高山矗立在沃格勒北部一英里处。几个世纪前，索拉姆尼克和伊斯塔利亚的军队在这里发生了冲突，传说中，牺牲的骑士的灵魂在山上徘徊，并监视着这个小镇。每年的翠鸟节都会重演这场战役，提醒人们注意村庄的历史，并在名义上纪念任何在战场上徘徊的灵魂。",
	"Along the road north of Vogler, a mile past High Hill, lies a mercenary camp. Known as the Ironclad Regiment, the soldiers here are under the command of Captain Ridomir \"Cudgel\" Ironsmile (introduced in the \"{@area Final Farewell|0ea|x}\" section). Cudgel is a friend of the deceased Ispin Greenshield and many others in town, and she brought her company to Vogler a week ago to attend Ispin's funeral.

	"Those who enter Vogler from the north pass through the unguarded River Gate, a 15-foot-tall wooden archway carved with two leaping fish on its frame. Over the years, locals have etched the coin-sized scales of these fish with prayers for bountiful fishing. Two large wooden doors stand within the arch, but they haven't been closed for years and are embedded in the surrounding dirt.": "从北方进入沃格勒的人要经过无人看守的河门，这是一个15英尺高的木制拱门，门框上雕刻着两条跳跃的鱼。多年来，当地人在这些鱼的硬币大小的鳞片上刻下了对丰收的祈祷。拱门内有两扇大木门，但多年来一直没有关闭，而是嵌入周围的泥土中。",

	"Vogler should begin to feel like a home away from home for the characters, and the villagers might even become like family to them.

	"The homes and shops in Vogler cluster around a grassy patch shaded by an ancient tree. This green is encircled by a dirt road that branches off into streets leading north out of the village and south to the ferry across the Vingaard, and others radiating out into the town. The village circle serves as a public space, meeting spot, and festival ground. An iron bell hangs atop a tall pole near the mayor's house. In times of need, anyone who vigorously rings the bell summons the mayor and {@dice 2d12} volunteer militia members ({@creature Guard||guards}) who arrive in about 5 minutes. The local militia is largely composed of retired farmers and fishers who exhibit more zeal than skill in the village's defense, but they all take the bell's sounding very seriously.": "沃格勒的住宅和商店都聚集在一片有古树遮挡的草地上。这片绿地被一条土路所包围，土路的分支是向北出村、向南通往文加德河对岸的渡口的街道，以及向镇上辐射的其他街道。村庄的圆圈是一个公共空间、聚会地点和节日场地。一个铁钟挂在镇长家附近的高杆上。在需要的时候，任何用力摇铃的人都会召唤镇长和{@dice 2d12}志愿民兵({@creature Guard||guards})，他们在大约5分钟内到达。当地的民兵主要由退休的农民和渔民组成，他们在村子的防御中表现出的热情多于技巧，但他们都非常重视铃声的响起。",
	"South of Vogler, an incomplete stone bridge begins to stretch across the Vingaard River. Half-constructed before the Cataclysm using techniques lost in the ages since, the bridge looks like a glorified pier—a remnant of once-promised glory. A simple ferry system of ropes and winches follows the bridge's supports and connects with posts on the opposite shore. Simple rafts and skiffs allow travelers and even small wagons to cross the river. The process is safe but slow, taking approximately 10 minutes for a raft to cross the broad river. Travelers can make use of the crossing themselves or hire a ferrier to aid them for 1 sp.": "在沃格勒的南部，一座不完整的石桥开始延伸到文加德河上。这座桥是在大灾变之前利用已经失传的技术建造的，看起来就像一个荣耀的码头--曾经承诺的荣耀的遗迹。一个由绳索和绞盘组成的简单渡轮系统沿着桥的支架，与对岸的柱子相连。简单的木筏和小艇让旅行者甚至是小马车都能过河。这个过程是安全的，但也是缓慢的，一个木筏需要大约10分钟才能穿过宽阔的河流。旅行者可以自己利用这个渡口，也可以雇佣一个渡工来帮助他们，费用为1比索。",
	"The horseshoe-shaped structure known as Westide House is only slightly larger than the other homes in Vogler, but its owner speaks of it as if it were an opulent country manor. This is the home of Lord {@creature Bakaris Uth Estide|DSotDQ} (neutral evil, human {@creature noble}; detailed in {@area chapter 4|189|x}) and his son, {@creature Bakaris the Younger|DSotDQ} (introduced in the \"{@area Heckler|0f4|x}\" section later in this chapter). Lord Bakaris is a Solamnic noble who claims to be living in exile after raiders burned his family home in Estwilde. In truth, Lord Bakaris and his son were driven from the region and sought anonymity in Vogler. They've been in the village for over a year, throwing their wealth around and treating the people of Vogler as backward yokels.": "被称为 \"Westide House \"的马蹄形建筑只比沃格勒的其他住宅大一点，但它的主人说起它时，就好像是一座富丽堂皇的乡村庄园。这是{@creature Bakaris Uth Estide|DSotDQ}勋爵（中立邪恶，人类{@creature noble}；详见{@area chapter 4|189|x}）和他儿子{@creature Bakaris the Younger|DSotDQ}（在本章后面的\"{@area Heckler|0f4|x} \"部分介绍）的家。巴卡利斯勋爵是一个索兰尼克贵族，在突袭者烧毁了他在埃斯特维尔德的家之后，他声称自己在流亡中生活。事实上，巴卡利斯勋爵和他的儿子被赶出了该地区，在沃格勒寻求隐姓埋名。他们在村子里呆了一年多，把他们的财富到处乱扔，把沃格勒的人当作落后的乡巴佬。",
	"Once the characters have reconnected with one another and explored Vogler to their liking, it's time to assemble at the Brass Crab for the funeral of Ispin Greenshield. {@creature Becklin Uth Viharin|DSotDQ}, who sent the characters their funeral invitations, catches up to the characters prior to the funeral.": "一旦角色们彼此重新联系起来，并按照自己的喜好探索沃格勒，就该在铜蟹餐厅集合，参加伊斯平-绿盾的葬礼了。葬礼前，给人物发送葬礼邀请函的{@creature Becklin Uth Viharin|DSotDQ}追上了人物。",
	"Becklin is hard to miss, as she's dressed in the full-plate armor and horned helmet of the Knights of Solamnia. Though she's never met the characters before, she recognizes one or more of them from Ispin's descriptions. Becklin introduces herself, offers her condolences, and invites the characters to come with her to the Brass Crab if they aren't already there. She explains that the service is meant to be a celebration of Ispin's life, and people will be encouraged to share over-the-top stories about him—like the inflated tales he was known for sharing.": "贝克林很难错过，因为她穿着索兰尼亚骑士团的全副盔甲，戴着角状头盔。虽然她以前从未见过这些人物，但她从伊斯平的描述中认出了他们中的一个或多个。贝克林做了自我介绍，表示哀悼，并邀请这些人物和她一起去铜蟹餐厅，如果他们还没有到那里的话。她解释说，这个仪式是为了庆祝伊斯平的一生，人们将被鼓励分享关于他的夸张故事，就像他以分享夸张故事而闻名。",

	"The region's commonfolk generally don't hold the Knights of Solamnia in high regard, most believing the knights had a hand in causing—or, at least, not preventing—the Cataclysm. However, the people of Vogler accept Becklin, as her skill at arms has kept the village safe from bandits and dangerous beasts for years.": "该地区的老百姓对索兰尼亚骑士团普遍不看好，大多数人认为骑士团与大灾变有关，或者至少没有阻止大灾变。然而，沃格勒的人们接受了贝克林，因为她的武器技能多年来一直使村庄免受强盗和危险野兽的侵害。",

	"This enormous cuirassed carp is a Vogler legend. Even sighting Benebog is considered good luck, and catching it makes a fisher an instant town legend. Benebog can be caught only once. If a character rolls a 20 on the Fish to Catch table after Benebog has been caught, a greater cuirassed carp tugs on their line instead.": "这条巨大的铜钱鱼是沃格勒的一个传奇。即使看到Benebog也被认为是好运气，而钓到它会使渔民立即成为镇上的传奇。贝内博格只能被捕获一次。如果一个角色在钓到贝内博格后，在 \"捕鱼表 \"上掷出20分，那么一条更大的红鲤鱼就会拽住他们的鱼线。",
	"The winner is determined by totaling the length of all fish each participant caught. Mayor Raven's catch totals 7 feet, followed by a villager whose catch totals 5 feet. The participant with the highest total is the winner. Participants then receive prizes.": "赢家是由每个参与者捕获的所有鱼的长度总和决定的。乌鸦市长的渔获物总长度为7英尺，其次是一位村民的渔获物总长度为5英尺。总数最高的参赛者为获胜者。然后，参与者将获得奖品。",
	"All contest participants receive tiny wooden carvings of kingfishers, while the winner receives their choice of a blue knit cap or a fishing fly made from blue feathers. These prizes are charmingly made but have no significant value. Should a character catch Benebog, the mayor gives the character an exceptionally crafted fishing pole carved with kingfishers, worth 50 gp. Additionally, for the rest of the day, the villagers laud the character with congratulations and free drinks.": "所有参赛者都会收到小小的翠鸟木雕，而获胜者则可以选择一顶蓝色的针织帽或用蓝色羽毛制成的钓鱼飞。这些奖品做得很迷人，但没有重要的价值。如果一个角色钓到了贝内博格，镇长会给这个角色一根雕刻着翠鸟的特殊工艺的钓鱼竿，价值50金镑。此外，在这一天的其余时间里，村民们会用祝贺和免费的饮料来赞美这个角色。",
	"Lord Bakaris drinks heavily during the festival and spends much of his time on the wharf, watching the fish catch and grumbling about how boring it is. He stands near the most competent-looking character participating in the contest and mockingly asks why they enjoy such a ridiculous pastime. (The {@area \"Castle Kalaman|183|x}\" section in {@adventure chapter 4|DSotDQ|4} presents more information on roleplaying Lord Bakaris.) For as long as Lord Bakaris is present, the character he's haranguing has disadvantage on Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) checks made during the fish catch.

	"The Kingfisher Festival culminates in the annual reenactment of the Battle of High Hill, held at a hill located about a 30-minute walk north of the village. The reenactment, which also serves as a drill for Vogler's militia, is followed by a feast at the Brass Crab.": "翠鸟节的高潮是一年一度的高山之战的重演，重演地点位于村子北面的一个山头，步行约30分钟。这场重演也是沃格勒民兵的演习，之后在铜蟹餐厅举行盛宴。",

	"Mayor Raven has given the village's militia a lot of attention recently. Some villagers think she hired Cudgel to visit Vogler and help with this event—possibly because of vague rumors of war in the east. With trained mercenaries on the opposing side, this year's reenactment could be more of a challenge for the militia than in past years.": "拉文村长最近对村里的民兵很重视。一些村民认为她雇佣了卡德格尔来访问沃格勒并帮助这次活动--可能是因为东部的战争的模糊传言。由于对立面有训练有素的雇佣兵，今年的重演对民兵来说可能比往年更有挑战性。",
	"Agents of the Red Dragon Army—part of the greater army waging war in eastern Ansalon—hatched this plan when they learned the mercenaries would join in the mock battle. The commanders of the Red Dragon Army bought Gragonis's loyalty, and they seek to take Vogler quickly as part of a greater scheme.": "红龙军的特工--在安萨隆东部发动战争的大军中的一员，在得知雇佣兵将加入模拟战役时，萌生了这个计划。红龙军的指挥官们买下了格拉戈尼斯的忠诚，他们试图迅速拿下沃格勒，作为更大计划的一部分。",
	"A contingent of the Red Dragon Army slipped into the lands near Vogler and crossed the Vingaard River in recent days. The draconians the characters might have encountered in {@area chapter 2|0cb|x} were part of this force. If Vogler can be taken by the traitorous members of the Ironclad Regiment, all the better. If it can't, the Dragon Army plans to bring its own devastating forces to bear.": "最近几天，一支红龙军的特遣队溜进了沃格勒附近的土地，并越过了文加德河。人物在{@area chapter 2|0cb|x}中可能遇到的龙人是这支部队的一部分。如果沃格勒能被铁甲团的叛徒成员拿下，那就更好了。如果不能，龙人军团计划将自己的破坏力发挥到极致。",

	"Passing through woods and fields, Vogler's parade of militia members and reenactment spectators finally reaches High Hill. The grassy slope is spotted with trees and crumbled stone fencing. Near the base, several dozen soldiers in matching armor stand in even formation. The contrast is striking between these mercenaries of the Ironclad Regiment and Vogler's militia—with their mismatched armor and crooked helmets—but it does nothing to dampen the spirits of those assembled for the Kingfisher Festival's climactic reenactment.": "穿过树林和田野，沃格勒的民兵成员和重演观众的游行队伍终于到达高山。草坡上布满了树木和破碎的石质围栏。在基地附近，几十名身着配套盔甲的士兵以均匀的队形站立。这些铁甲团的雇佣兵和沃格勒的民兵之间形成了鲜明的对比--他们的盔甲不配套，头盔歪歪扭扭，但这丝毫没有影响到为翠鸟节的高潮重演而聚集的人们的精神。",
	"Encourage all characters to participate in the reenactment, if for no other reason than to honor Ispin Greenshield's last wishes. If a character refuses, Mayor Raven offers to pay them 5 gp to be a judge during the battle, making sure no one uses real weapons and calling for aid if someone gets hurt.": "鼓励所有角色参与重演，如果没有其他原因，就是为了尊重伊斯平-绿盾的遗愿。如果有角色拒绝，乌鸦镇长会付给他们5戈比，让他们在战斗中担任裁判，确保没有人使用真正的武器，并在有人受伤时呼唤援助。",
	"To prepare for the battle, Mayor Raven calls out to those assembled, explaining the mercenaries will charge up the west side of the hill while the militia and other participants charge down. The two groups will clash midway in a mock fight, with the mercenaries' Istarian forces eventually retreating. Participants are encouraged to use their own armor but are given wooden spears with padded tips to prevent them from dealing damage. The mayor reminds everyone not to use real weapons during the reenactment so nobody gets hurt.": "为了准备战斗，拉文市长向聚集在一起的人喊话，解释说雇佣兵将从山丘的西侧冲上去，而民兵和其他参与者则从山丘上冲下来。两组人马将在中途发生冲突，进行模拟战斗，雇佣军的伊斯塔利亚部队最终将撤退。鼓励参与者使用他们自己的盔甲，但会得到带垫子的木质长矛，以防止它们造成伤害。市长提醒大家在重演过程中不要使用真正的武器，以免有人受伤。",

	"After much laughter and jostling, the mayor, Cudgel, and other spectators walk to a nearby vantage to watch. As they do, the militia takes up its position atop High Hill—the same hill Solamnic troops held centuries ago. They face the mercenaries of the Ironclad Regiment at the base of the hill, arrayed as the forces of Istar once were. Although the event is only a reenactment, a tingle of excitement fills the field. Somewhere on the line, a reenactor hoots and yells, \"Let's send those Istarian rats running!\"": "在许多笑声和打闹声中，市长、卡德格尔和其他观众走到附近的有利位置观看。当他们这样做的时候，民兵们在高山顶上站好了位置--几个世纪前，索拉姆尼克的军队也曾占据过这座山。他们在山脚下面对铁甲军团的雇佣兵，他们的阵容与伊斯塔的部队曾经的阵容一样。虽然这只是一场重演，但场内却充满了兴奋的感觉。在队伍的某处，一个重演者吼叫着说：\"让我们让那些伊斯塔利亚的老鼠跑起来！\"",
	"A moment later, a trumpet blast signals the start of the battle. \"For Istar!\" yells the mercenaries' leader, a tall half-ogre among several mounted soldiers. The mock Istarian troops assault the hill. Around you, the Vogler militia charges to meet them.": "片刻之后，一声号角吹响，预示着战斗的开始。\"为了伊斯特！\"雇佣兵的首领大喊道，他是几个骑兵中的一个高大的半戈尔。模仿伊斯塔利亚的军队向山头进攻。在你周围，沃格勒的民兵冲锋陷阵，迎接他们。",
	"The unexpected sound of metal clashing on armor rings across the field, silencing laughter and melodramatic boasts. A ribbon of red splashes over the grassy hill, followed by shocked screams. Any pretense of a reenactment shatters—High Hill is the site of a true battle once more. Within moments, all around you, armed mercenaries attack unprepared villagers fighting for their lives.": "金属与盔甲碰撞的意外声音响彻原野，使笑声和夸夸其谈的声音消失。一条红色的带子飞溅在草坡上，接着是震惊的尖叫声。任何重演的幌子都被打破了--高山再次成为真正的战斗现场。顷刻间，在你周围，武装的雇佣兵袭击了毫无准备的村民，为他们的生命而战。",

Castle Kalaman is a towering structure and easy to find without directions, and the guards can also direct the characters to any site in the \"{@area Kalaman Locations|172|x}\" section.": "门卫拦住人物，询问他们的业务，但只要人物没有敌意，就允许他们进入城市。如果有人物问起巴卡利斯勋爵或沃格勒难民的代表，守卫就会为他们指明卡拉曼城堡的道路。守卫们记得他们的队长不久前带领一个符合巴卡利斯描述的人来到城堡。卡拉曼城堡是一个高耸的建筑，没有指示也很容易找到，守卫也可以引导人物到\"{@area Kalaman Locations|172|x} \"部分的任何地点。",
	"When the characters and Darrett arrive at Castle Kalaman, read the following:": "当人物和达雷特到达卡拉曼城堡时，请阅读以下内容。",
	"Even if the imposing Castle Kalaman didn't stand atop hundred-foot cliffs, it would still tower over every other structure in the city. The path to it rises up the cliffside, overlooked by gigantic statues matching those that line the city's walls. At the path's end, guards stand before an open gate.": "即使巍峨的卡拉曼城堡没有矗立在百英尺高的悬崖上，它仍然会耸立在城市的其他建筑之上。通往它的道路在悬崖边升起，被巨大的雕像所俯瞰，这些雕像与城墙上的雕像一样。在路的尽头，守卫站在一扇打开的门前。",
	"The guards at Castle Kalaman ask the characters to state their business. If the characters explain that they're representatives of Vogler's people, a guard leads them across a courtyard toward a council chamber where Lord Bakaris is speaking with the city council.": "卡拉曼城堡的守卫要求人物说明他们的事情。如果人物解释说他们是沃格勒的人的代表，一个卫兵就会带他们穿过一个院子，走向一个议事厅，巴卡利斯勋爵正在和市议会谈话。",
	"While the characters are making their way to the council chamber, read the following text:": "在人物前往议会厅的过程中，阅读以下文字。",
	"As you cross Castle Kalaman's paved courtyard, a familiar figure intercepts you with an arrogant smile—{@creature Bakaris the Younger|DSotDQ}.": "当你穿过卡拉曼城堡铺设的庭院时，一个熟悉的身影带着傲慢的微笑拦住了你--{@creature Bakaris the Younger|DSotDQ}。",

	"When the group arrives at the council chamber, the guard escorts the characters inside and explains who they are. After this, read the following:": "当他们到达议事厅时，卫兵护送人物进去，并解释他们的身份。在这之后，阅读以下内容。",
	"Eight serious-looking people sit around a broad table in the middle of a spacious hall. At the table's end, a tall man with plaited blond hair and a velvet vest of blue and gold stands to greet you.": "八个表情严肃的人围坐在宽敞的大厅中央的一张宽大的桌子旁。在桌子的一端，一个梳着金色辫子、穿着蓝色和金色天鹅绒背心的高个子男人站起来迎接你。",
	"\"Welcome, guests. I'm Governor Calof Miat. Your leader has briefed us on the situation in Vogler, his bold defense, and his eagerness to strike back against these invaders.\" As Miat says this, he nods to a man near him—Lord Bakaris, who glares at your intrusion.": "\"欢迎，客人们。我是卡洛夫-米亚特总督。你们的领袖已经向我们介绍了沃格勒的情况，他的大胆防御，以及他对这些入侵者的急切反击。\" 当米亚特说这句话时，他向他身边的一个人--巴卡利斯勋爵点了点头，他对你的闯入瞪着眼睛。",
	"\"Tell us,\" the governor continues, \"are your people still preparing for battle?\"": "\"告诉我们，\"总督继续说，\"你的人还在为战斗做准备吗？\"",
	"It's clear from the governor's words and Lord Bakaris's expression that Bakaris is trying to advance his own agenda. Lord Bakaris told the council the villagers are taking up arms to retake their home. The characters know this isn't the case, though. Mayor Raven is focused on ensuring the villagers have food, security, and support in the days to come. And the characters are certain the refugees didn't appoint Lord Bakaris their leader.": "从总督的话和巴卡利斯勋爵的表情可以看出，巴卡利斯是想推进自己的计划。巴卡利斯勋爵告诉议会，村民们正在拿起武器夺回他们的家园。不过，人物们知道情况并非如此。拉文市长专注于确保村民们在未来的日子里有食物、安全和支持。角色们确信，难民们并没有任命巴卡利斯爵士为他们的领袖。",
	"\"I was born for greatness, and I'll take what I deserve.\"": "\"我为伟大而生，我将接受我应得的东西。\"",
	"\"My brilliance and worthiness are clear to everyone intelligent enough to deserve my time.\"": "\"我的才华和价值对每一个聪明到值得我花时间的人来说都很清楚\"。",

	"\"My blood makes me a leader. If commoners can do it, how hard can it be?\"": "\"我的血统使我成为领导者。如果普通人都能做到，那还能有多难？\"",
	"During the conversation with Kalaman's leaders, the characters might ask about retaking Vogler. Lord Bakaris is eager to do this, while Darrett prioritizes ensuring the villagers' safety. For the time being, the city council is more interested in gaining information about the enemy than running headlong into battle. If necessary, use Darrett to temper characters' desire for immediate revenge.": "在与卡拉曼领导人的谈话中，人物可能会问到重新夺回沃格勒的问题。巴卡利斯勋爵很想这么做，而达雷特则优先考虑确保村民的安全。就目前而言，市议会对获得有关敌人的信息更感兴趣，而不是一头扎进战斗。如果有必要，可以用达雷特来克制人物对立即复仇的渴望。",
	"It's up to the characters to correct Bakaris's misinformation. Kalaman's council listens to what the characters say, asking probing questions until the truth of what happened in Vogler comes out. As the characters speak, Lord Bakaris contradicts them, trying to bolster his own fictitious position as the village leader who deserves accolades for bravely facing the Red Dragon Army. Through roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) check, a character can silence Lord Bakaris.": "纠正巴卡利斯的错误信息要靠这些人物。卡拉曼的议会听取了这些人物的发言，提出了一些探究性的问题，直到沃格勒发生的事情真相大白。当人物说话时，巴卡利斯勋爵反驳他们，试图支持他自己作为村长的虚构地位，因为他勇敢地面对红龙军，应该得到赞誉。通过角色扮演或在DC14魅力({@skill Intimidation})检查中成功，一个角色可以让巴卡利斯勋爵沉默。",
	"After the characters explain the current situation of those who escaped Vogler, read the following:": "在人物解释完逃离沃格勒的人的现状后，阅读以下内容。",
	"Governor Miat frowns. \"This is all dire news. My heart goes out to your friends and families, but I hope you can understand our reticence to welcome you all through our city's gates. These aren't normal times. Marshal?\"": "米亚特总督皱起眉头。\"这都是可怕的消息。我对你们的朋友和家人表示同情，但我希望你们能理解我们对欢迎你们进入我们城市的大门的迟疑。这不是一个正常的时代。元帅？\"",
	"The governor gestures to a stern woman wearing armor embellished with the blue and gold colors of Kalaman. She nods and begins, \"I am Marshal Vendri, commander of Kalaman's military forces. I'm afraid your situation is far from unique.\"": "总督向一位身穿卡拉曼蓝金两色盔甲的严酷女性打手势。她点点头，开始说：\"我是文德里元帅，卡拉曼军事力量的指挥官。我担心你的情况远非独特。\"",
	"Marshal Vendri goes on to explain that Vogler isn't the only community in the region to face peril. She shares the following details:": "文德里警长继续解释说，沃格勒并不是该地区唯一面临危险的社区。她分享了以下细节。",

	"Marshal Vendri knows nothing of draconians, the Dragon Queen, or the Dragon Army. Her experience is considerable, but it involves battling raiders from Estwilde and ogres from the Taman Busuk. Everyone here has heard rumors of war in the eastern nation of Khur, but until now, they hadn't considered that far-off nation's struggles relevant.": "文德里元帅对龙人、龙后或龙军一无所知。她的经验是相当丰富的，但它涉及到与来自埃斯特维尔德的突袭者和来自塔曼布苏克的食人魔作战。这里的每个人都听说过东部国家库尔的战争传闻，但直到现在，他们还没有考虑到那个遥远的国家的斗争与之相关。",
	"Marshal Vendri is eager to hear anything the characters know about the enemy. She's even more impressed if the characters have physical evidence of draconians or Dragon Army soldiers.": "文德里元帅很想听听人物对敌人的任何了解。如果这些人物有龙人或龙军士兵的实物证据，她会更加印象深刻。",
	"Once the characters have heard the marshal's report, the governor asks the characters and Darrett to step outside while the council discusses what they've learned. Lord Bakaris isn't asked to leave.": "当人物听完元帅的报告后，州长要求人物和达雷特到外面去，让议会讨论他们所了解的情况。巴卡利斯大人并没有被要求离开。",
	"Darrett and the characters are ushered into the hall outside the council chamber. Use this opportunity to have Darrett reemphasize how important it is for Vogler's people to have Kalaman's support and protection.

	"When the characters reenter the council chamber, the governor bids them sit. After they're settled, read the following text:": "当人物重新进入议事厅时，州长请他们坐下。在他们落座后，阅读以下文字。",
	"In a decisive tone, Governor Miat says, \"The citizens of Kalaman are prepared to offer your people shelter in the neighborhoods outside the city walls, the protection of our soldiers, and—while we can spare it—food from our tables.\" He folds his hands and fixes his eyes on you. \"There is a condition, though.\"": "米亚特总督用果断的语气说：\"卡拉曼的公民准备为你们的人提供城墙外街区的庇护，提供我们士兵的保护，以及--当我们能抽出时间时--提供我们餐桌上的食物。\" 他双手合十，将目光投向你。\"不过，有一个条件。\"",

	"Sworn characters will be given a palm-sized emblem with the blue-and-gold symbol of Kalaman etched into its face. This is a symbol of their special rank, which is akin to a lieutenancy (higher than soldiers but lower than commanders).": "宣誓过的人物会得到一个手掌大小的徽章，其表面刻有卡拉曼的蓝金符号。这是他们特殊等级的象征，类似于中尉（比士兵高，但比指挥官低）。",
	"If the characters refuse, Darrett asks to speak with them for a moment. He plans to accept the governor's terms and attempts to convince the characters to join him. He wants their aid not only to protect his people, but to counter the terrifying threat of the Dragon Army. If the characters still resist, Darrett suggests the characters could work for him as aides rather than working directly for the military—a proposal Kalaman's leaders are willing to accept.": "如果人物拒绝，达雷特会要求与他们交谈片刻。他打算接受州长的条件，并试图说服这些人物加入他。他希望他们的援助不仅是为了保护他的人民，而且是为了对抗龙族军队的可怕威胁。如果这些人物仍然抵制，达雷特建议这些人物可以作为助手为他工作，而不是直接为军队工作--这是卡拉曼的领导人愿意接受的建议。",

	"After hearing that Darrett—and likely some of the characters—agreed to aid Kalaman's military, Raven says she and the survivors of Vogler's militia intend to offer their assistance as well. She also asks the characters to stop calling her mayor—so long as Vogler is in Dragon Army hands, she's just Raven.": "在听说达雷特--可能还有一些人物--同意援助卡拉曼的军队后，拉文说她和沃格勒的民兵幸存者也打算提供他们的援助。她还要求这些人物不要再叫她市长--只要沃格勒在龙军手中，她就只是瑞文。",

	"Encourage the characters to use skills like Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) or any artisan's tools they might have to support Vogler's people and make their accommodations more welcoming.

Mark this hex on the players' map of the region in {@adventure appendix E|DSotDQ|12|Appendix E: Maps}.": "当队伍离开神殿时，如果角色们还没有救出卡里昂克雷营地的海精灵，就会有一个{@creature sea elf scout|DSotDQ}接近{@creature Ishvern|DSotDQ}，告诉他他们已经找到了被抓走的同伴的下落。这些海精灵被囚禁在一个浑浊的湖泊中的龙军营地（见\"{@area I: Camp Carrionclay|2f1|x} \"部分）。这些海精灵斥候提供了前往{@adventure map 5.1|DSotDQ|5|Map 5.1: kalaman and northern wastes}的I区的方向。在玩家的{@adventure appendix E|DSotDQ|12|Appendix E: Maps}区域地图上标记这个六角。"
