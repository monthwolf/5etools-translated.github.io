	"This adventure debuts as a part of the second Ravnica Weekend, a celebration of all things Ravnica. The adventure takes place a few weeks after the events depicted in {@adventure Krenko's Way|kkw}, an adventure featured at the first Ravnica Weekend and available as the introductory adventure in {@book Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica|ggr}. Prior knowledge of that adventure is not necessary to enjoy {@i A Zib for Your Thoughts}.": "这个冒险作为第二个拉夫尼卡周末的一部分首次亮相，这是一个关于拉夫尼卡的庆祝活动。这个冒险发生在{@adventure Krenko's Way|kkw}所描述的事件之后的几个星期，{@book Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica|ggr}是第一个拉夫尼卡周末中的一个冒险，可以作为介绍性的冒险。欣赏{@i A Zib for Your Thoughts}不需要事先了解该冒险。",
	"Vezska, a member of the Golgari Swarm, came upon a discarded magic item on her travels throughout the Undercity of the Tenth District. She surreptitiously had the item identified as a {@item vial of thought capture|azfyt}, an item allows the user to encode and store thought strands. As a findbroker, Vezska takes discarded items and resells them to surface dwellers. Once she determined what she had, Vezska put out to her network that she was in possession of the item and got a prospective client within hours.": "Vezska，Golgari Swarm的成员，在她穿越第十区的地下城市时，发现了一个被丢弃的魔法物品。她偷偷地把这个物品鉴定为{@item vial of thought capture|azfyt}，这个物品可以让使用者编码和储存思想链。作为一个找到的经纪人，Vezska将被丢弃的物品转卖给地面居民。一旦确定了她所拥有的东西，维兹卡就向她的网络发出她拥有该物品的消息，并在几小时内得到了一个潜在的客户。",
	"The client promised a handsome sum of zinos (gold pieces) to Vezska but had a catch–the vial had to be delivered to them with three specific thoughts already captured. Vezska accepted the deal, got the information from the client on the individuals and thoughts that needed capturing, and contacted the adventurers for help.": "客户承诺给Vezska一笔丰厚的Zinos（金币），但有一个条件--小瓶必须与已经捕获的三种特定思想一起交付给他们。维兹卡接受了这笔交易，从客户那里得到了关于需要捕捉的个人和思想的信息，并联系了冒险家寻求帮助。",
	"The vial belongs to a powerful operative of House Dimir, the guild of secrets and spies. Its absence from its owner's possession will not go undetected for too long...": "这个小瓶属于迪米尔家族的一名强大的特工，即秘密和间谍行会的特工。它从主人手中消失的时间不会太长，不会被发现......",
	"{@i A Zib for Your Thoughts} is a short Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game adventure for a party of four to six 2nd-level adventurers, playable in about two hours. It is set in the Tenth District of Ravnica and can serve as an introductory adventure to the setting. A balance of character classes is helpful, since the adventurers will face a variety of challenges. Adventurers can be affiliated with any of the guilds.": "{@i A Zib for Your Thoughts}是一个简短的龙与地下城角色扮演游戏的冒险，适合四至六名二级冒险者，可在约两小时内玩完。它的背景是拉夫尼卡的第十区，可以作为这个环境的入门冒险。角色等级的平衡很有帮助，因为冒险者将面临各种挑战。冒险者可以隶属于任何一个行会。",
	"Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.": "出现在这样的方框中的文字是为了让玩家在他们的角色第一次到达某个地点或在某个特定情况下大声朗读或转述，如文中所述。",
	"The adventure begins with the characters in a sewer tunnel below the streets where they've arranged a meeting with Vezska, a Golgari findbroker. She came into possession of a {@item vial of thought capture|azfyt}, a magic item that allows the user to capture a few thoughts and store them for later access. A client approached her and wanted to purchase not only the vial, but specific thoughts to be placed in it. Vezska decided that it was best to outsource this sort of work and contacted the adventurers.": "冒险开始时，人物在街道下面的一个下水道隧道里，他们安排了与戈尔加里找到的经纪人维兹卡会面。她得到了一个{@item vial of thought capture|azfyt}，一个允许使用者捕捉一些想法并储存起来以便日后使用的魔法物品。一个客户找到她，不仅想购买这个小瓶，还想购买要放在里面的特定思想。维兹卡决定最好把这种工作外包出去，于是联系了冒险家。",
	"Vezska presents an errand list to the adventurers, which includes names of three individuals and the specific thoughts that they need to store within the vial. Once all three thoughts are captured within the vial, the adventurers can return to Vezska to collect their reward. She will deliver the \"filled\" vial to her client.": "维兹卡向冒险者出示了一份任务清单，其中包括三个人的名字和他们需要在小瓶中储存的具体思想。一旦在小瓶中捕获了所有三种思想，冒险者就可以回到维兹卡那里领取他们的奖励。她会把 \"装满 \"的小瓶交给她的客户。",
	"The adventurers must visit three individuals and find a way to get the thoughts out of each one. Each individual has reasons for holding back their information, so the party must find a way to obtain the specific thoughts–through deception, negotiation, or coercion. Once they have all three thoughts, they can return to Vezska and collect their reward.": "冒险家们必须访问三个人，并想办法从每个人那里获得思想。每个人都有隐瞒信息的理由，所以他们必须找到一种方法来获得特定的思想--通过欺骗、谈判或胁迫。一旦他们得到了所有三种思想，他们就可以回到维兹卡，领取他们的奖励。",
	"It's not just that easy, though. The {@item vial of thought capture|azfyt} is a prized item among House Dimir, a guild that trades in knowledge and secrets. The magic item has a built-in silent alarm system to notify the owner if someone uses it. After it is first activated while in possession of the characters, the Dimir operative that owns the item is notified pending retrieval specialists to reacquire the vial from the party by whatever means necessary.": "不过，这并不只是那么简单。{@item vial of thought capture|azfyt}是迪米尔家族的珍贵物品，这是一个以知识和秘密为交易对象的行会。这个魔法物品有一个内置的无声警报系统，如果有人使用它就会通知主人。当它在人物手中首次被激活后，拥有该物品的迪米尔人就会被通知，等待检索专家通过任何必要的手段从当事人那里重新获得小瓶。",
	"Veszka was hired by a client from a guild to accomplish this task. Each guild has their own reason for wanting the specific information presented.": "Veszka受雇于一个公会的客户来完成这项任务。每个行会都有自己的理由，希望得到所介绍的具体信息。",
	"At the beginning of the adventure, roll a client from the chart below, or choose one. The guild affiliation of the client may influence future adventures if you choose. Vezska does not give up the description of the client unless forced to do so.": "在冒险开始时，从下面的图表中掷出一个客户，或者选择一个。如果你选择的话，客户的公会归属可能会影响未来的冒险。维兹卡不会放弃对客户的描述，除非被迫这样做。",

	"If they haven't done so already, the players may want to establish connections between some of the characters before their introductions. Personal connections between characters could include:": "如果他们还没有这样做，玩家可能想在他们的介绍之前建立一些人物之间的联系。人物之间的个人联系可以包括。",

	"In addition, one or more of the characters might want to have Vezska as their contact in the Golgari if they haven't already established their contacts with their character. If that's the case, then the meetup was brokered through that adventurer. If not, Vezska could have simply put out word she was looking for adventurers, the party got word and assembled itself.": "此外，如果一个或多个角色还没有与他们的角色建立联系，他们可能想让Vezska作为他们在Golgari的联系人。如果是这样的话，那么这次会面就是通过那个冒险家促成的。如果不是这样，维兹卡可以简单地放出消息说她在寻找冒险者，队伍得到消息后就会自行集结。",

	"This dark blue vial allows you to read another's surface thoughts and capture them as thought strands, storing the strands within the vial. As an action, you can activate the vial to target a creature you can see within 10 feet of you to learn its surface thoughts and pull the thoughts learned out of the creature's head as a tangible glowing string of energy known as a thought strand. The strands can be stored in the vial for up to 24 hours or until the vial reaches capacity, in which case the oldest strands dissipate. A creature affected by the vial knows that its thoughts are being probed.": "这个深蓝色的小瓶允许你读取他人的表面思想，并将它们捕捉为思想串，将这些思想串储存在小瓶中。作为一个行动，你可以激活这个小瓶，以你10英尺范围内可以看到的生物为目标，学习它的表面思想，并将学到的思想从生物的头脑中拉出来，成为一串有形的发光的能量，称为思想串。思想串可以在小瓶中储存24小时，或者直到小瓶达到容量，在这种情况下，最古老的思想串会消散。受小瓶影响的生物知道它的思想正在被探查。",
	"The vial can also store thought strands created by the {@spell encode thoughts|GGR} cantrip. It does not extend the duration of those strands beyond 8 hours, but stored strands do not disappear if you cast {@spell encode thoughts|GGR} again during the duration of the cantrip.": "这个小瓶也可以储存由{@spell encode thoughts|GGR}咒语创造的思想线。它不会将这些思想线的持续时间延长到8小时以上，但如果你在咒语持续期间再次施放{@spell encode thoughts|GGR}，储存的思想线也不会消失。",

	"Vezska hands over the vial and gives the party the information she was provided on the subjects and what thoughts need to be obtained. All the individuals are known to reside in the Tenth District. Vezska doesn't know any of them personally or by reputation.": "维兹卡交出了小瓶，并向当事人提供了关于这些对象的信息以及需要获得的想法。所有这些人都是已知的居住在第十区的人。Vezska并不认识他们中的任何一个人，也不知道他们的名声。",
	"A red-haired, roan, female centaur and horncaller (a type of beastmaster) in the Selesnya Conclave. The characters must learn the name of the gardening book that she recently returned to the Ismeri Library.": "塞勒斯尼亚协约国中的一个红发、罗恩、女半人马和角斗士（一种兽人）。人物必须了解她最近返回伊斯梅里图书馆的园艺书的名字。",

If they don't succeed, they don't get paid. If they ask about keeping the vial, Vezska tells them that it's hers and taking from a findbroker is a good way to wind up as fertilizer.": "一旦人物得到适当的简报并准备好开始，Vezska提醒他们，他们有24小时的时间带着小瓶和所需的思想线回来。如果他们不成功，他们就没有报酬。如果他们问起保留小瓶的问题，维兹卡告诉他们，这是她的，从一个经纪人那里拿东西是一个很好的方式，可以作为肥料结束。",
	"The party can take different approaches to find the individuals on the list. Once the characters find out the location of the individuals, see the appropriate section below.": "党派可以采取不同的方法来寻找名单上的人。一旦人物找到了这些人的位置，请看下面相应的章节。",
	"If a character has an appropriate contact to press for information, they can reach out to that contact for assistance. It takes one hour to arrange a meeting with the contact and {@dice 1d6} hours for the contact to find the individual's place of work and residence. If the contact is not particularly suited to find the requested individual, the time it takes to find their location is doubled.": "如果一个角色有合适的联系人，可以向其逼问信息，他们可以向该联系人寻求帮助。安排与联系人会面需要一个小时，而联系人找到个人的工作和住所需要{@dice 1d6}小时。如果该联系人不是特别适合寻找被请求的个人，那么找到他们的位置所需的时间就会增加一倍。",
	"Characters can go to public gathering places to attempt to find out where the individuals are located. After {@dice 1d4} hours, a character sifting through many idle conversations makes a DC 10 Charisma check. On a success, they find out either the place of work or the residence of the individual, as they choose. Characters get advantage on this check if they are in the precinct where the subject lives.": "角色可以去公共集会场所试图找出这些人的位置。在{@dice 1d4}个小时后，通过许多闲谈的人物进行DC10魅力检查。如果成功，他们就会发现个人的工作地点或住所，由他们选择。如果人物在目标人物居住的辖区内，则在这个检查中获得优势。",

	"It takes roughly a half an hour to travel to where Argona or Delrim are found no matter where the characters are in the city, thanks to public transit. The journey through the rubblebelt to visit Herringbone takes about two hours.": "无论人物在城市的哪个角落，由于有了公共交通，到阿尔戈纳或德尔林所在的地方大概需要半小时。穿过废墟地带去拜访赫林邦，大约需要两个小时。",
	"After the characters have used the vial to capture at least one thought strand, a silent magical alarm is sent to the former owner of the vial to inform them that it has been used by someone else. The former owner, a powerful Dimir operative not present in this adventure, sends out a response to attempt to reclaim the vial. The former owner is aware of the vial's location as a result of the magic placed on the vial, but that divination magic fades within 24 hours.": "在人物使用小瓶捕获了至少一条思想链之后，一个无声的魔法警报被发送到小瓶的前主人那里，告知他们小瓶已经被别人使用了。前主人是一个强大的迪米尔特工，在这次冒险中没有出现，他发出了一个回应，试图夺回小瓶。由于小瓶上的魔法，前主人知道小瓶的位置，但这种占卜魔法在24小时内就会消失。",

Ideally, this encounter would take place on a busy street, a transit station, or some other location with good hiding spots and escape routes.": "与迪米尔家族的遭遇应该发生在第二次使用小瓶的时候。理想的情况是，这次遭遇发生在繁忙的街道、中转站或其他一些有良好藏身之处和逃跑路线的地方。",

	"The thought spy casts {@spell disguise self} to appear as an innocuous individual (a shopkeep, librarian, etc.) and walks up to the character with the vial and asks to accompany the disguised spy back to their place for help. The thought spy takes them to a nearby House Dimir safehouse (where the other spies are waiting) and attempts to obtain the item through a Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check, {@spell charm person} spell, or by force. If the retrieval team resorts to using force, a {@creature flying horror|ggr} arrives as backup after one round of combat.": "思想间谍施展{@spell disguise self}，显示为一个无害的人（店主、图书管理员等），走到拿着小瓶的角色面前，要求陪同伪装的间谍回到他们的地方寻求帮助。被认为是间谍的人将他们带到附近的迪米尔家族安全屋（其他间谍在那里等待），并试图通过灵巧（{@skill Sleight of Hand}）检查、{@spell charm person}法术或武力来获得物品。如果取回物品的队伍选择使用武力，那么在一轮战斗后会有一个{@creature flying horror|ggr}的人赶来作为后援。",
	"Captured spies know only that they were brought in to retrieve the vial and drop it off at a secure location in the undercity. The secretive cells of the Dimir ensure that no unneeded information is passed on to operatives in the field.": "被抓获的间谍只知道他们被带去取回小瓶，并把它扔在城市地下的一个安全地点。迪米尔的秘密小组确保没有不需要的信息被传递给外地的特工人员。",
	"If a character in the party is a member of House Dimir, they are aware of what thought strands are and how valuable a commodity they represent to the guild of secrets. The character might sympathize with the operative who lost the vial and try to side with them in order to curry favor with their guild.": "如果聚会中的某个角色是迪米尔家族的成员，他们就知道思想线是什么，以及它们对秘密公会来说是多么宝贵的商品。该人物可能会同情丢失小瓶的特工，并试图站在他们一边，以讨好他们的公会。",
	"It's okay for this character to have this sort of conflict and possibly their own agenda, so long as it doesn't create too much tension within the rest of the party. Remind the player that there are many cells within the Dimir and they are operating in a relatively independent fashion. Some cells may be at odds with others, so it's not unreasonable to be keeping the operative from retrieving their lost vial.": "这个角色有这种冲突，可能还有自己的议程，只要不在党内其他成员中造成太多紧张就可以了。提醒玩家，迪米尔内部有许多细胞，它们以相对独立的方式运作。有些细胞可能会与其他细胞发生冲突，所以阻止行动者取回他们丢失的小瓶也不是没有道理的。",
	"In the end, the disposition of the vial after Vezska gives it to her client could serve as a fertile seed for another adventure for that character, amongst the many other secrets that this adventure presents": "最后，在Vezska将小瓶交给她的客户后，小瓶的处置可以作为该角色另一次冒险的肥沃种子，以及这次冒险所呈现的许多其他秘密。",
	"If the spies succeed in stealing the item, but the party notices the theft, a chase through the streets of the Tenth District ensues. You can use the {@table Urban Chase Complications|dmg} table in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg|8|chases} to adjudicate the chase.": "如果间谍成功地偷到了物品，但当事人注意到了偷窃行为，那么接下来就会在第十区的街道上展开追逐战。你可以使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg|8|chases}中的{@table Urban Chase Complications|dmg}表来裁决这场追逐战。",
	"If the spies manage to steal the vial and escape the party, their mission has failed. They can still attempt to find each individual and the answers to the questions, but it's only for their use.": "如果间谍们设法偷到了小瓶并逃离了聚会，他们的任务就失败了。他们仍然可以尝试找到每个人和问题的答案，但这只是为他们所用。",
	"The Selesnyan centaur {@creature horncaller|GGR} Argona has had some attitude issues of late, earning some remedial work time from her superiors. She is a recent convert to the Conclave, having been raised in a Gruul clan. As a horncaller, she's responsible for the care and training of beasts in the guild. But her temper has earned her some time landscaping the topiaries on the grounds of Millennial Platform, a floating structure moored to immense chains that affords the best view of the Tenth District and beyond. She can be found on this platform during the day.": "塞勒斯尼亚半人马{@creature horncaller|GGR}阿戈纳最近有一些态度问题，赢得了她的上司的一些补救工作时间。她是最近才皈依协约国的，在格鲁尔家族中长大。作为一名角斗士，她负责照顾和训练公会里的野兽。但她的脾气为她赢得了一些时间来美化千年平台上的拓扑植物。千年平台是一个浮动的结构，停泊在巨大的铁链上，提供了第十区和其他地区的最佳视野。白天可以在这个平台上找到她。",
	"In the evening, Argona retires to her yurt in Beast Haven, a neighborhood known for raising the best animals in the Tenth District. If the characters encounter her here, she's warier of them and all social interaction checks are made with disadvantage unless initiated by a member of Selesnya or Gruul guilds.": "傍晚时分，Argona回到了她位于野兽港的蒙古包里，这是一个以饲养第十区最好的动物而闻名的街区。如果角色在这里遇到她，她会对他们更加警惕，所有的社会交往检查都是不利的，除非是由塞勒斯尼亚或格鲁尔公会的成员发起。",
	"Every citizen has an annual token that they can redeem for one zeppelid ride to the platform, including the characters. The public zeppelid transports only run from dawn to dusk. If they wish to pay for the journey instead, it costs 1 zino (gp) to take the zeppelid from the main transit hub Augustin Station to Millennial Platform.": "每个公民都有一个年度代币，他们可以用这个代币换取一次前往平台的zeppelid，包括人物。公共zeppelid运输工具只在黎明至黄昏运行。如果他们希望支付旅程费用，从主要交通枢纽奥古斯丁站乘坐zeppelid到千禧年平台的费用是1兹诺（gp）。",
	"These are immense floating creatures that remain buoyant through many air sacs on their balloon-like bodies. The result of the Simic Combine's biomancy, they are easily tamed and are often used by Ravnicans for air transportation. An enclosed compartment is often harnessed to their frames to carry travelers.": "这是一种巨大的漂浮生物，通过其气球般的身体上的许多气囊保持浮力。它们是西米克组合的生物魔法的结果，很容易被驯服，并经常被拉夫尼克人用于空中运输。一个封闭的车厢经常被绑在它们的框架上，用来运送旅客。",

	"The garden grounds where Argona works are a short walk away near an elegantly carved marble building ringed on three sides by manicured topiaries depicting all manner of beasts.": "阿尔戈纳工作的花园场地离一座雕刻精美的大理石建筑很近，它的三面都是修剪整齐的拓荒植物，描绘着各种野兽。",

	"Argona is attempting to trim the topiaries, but she's having problems. The topiaries are animated, and don't particularly take well to trimmings. Normally, the Conclave would assign a druid to this task, but Argona has been asked to do it to help her \"get in touch with her peaceful self.\" It's not going well so far.": "阿尔戈纳正试图修剪这些植物，但她遇到了问题。这些植物都是有生命的，而且对修剪并不特别适应。通常情况下，协约国会指派一名德鲁伊来完成这项任务，但阿尔戈娜被要求这样做，以帮助她 \"接触到她平静的自我\"。到目前为止，进展并不顺利。",
	"If the characters approach Argona, she hails them and tries to downplay her frustration now that others have noticed her. She explains what she's doing and tells the characters the topiaries keep moving away when she draws close. She must trim four of them today–two that look like brushstriders (an elk-like creature) and two that look like ceratoks (a rhino-like creature). Each should only take a few minutes to trim, but she admits even though she's been learning how to garden, she's not a plant person and they're skittish.": "如果人物接近阿尔戈娜，她会向他们打招呼，并试图淡化她的挫折感，因为别人已经注意到她了。她解释了她正在做的事情，并告诉那些人物，当她靠近时，那些拓印植物就会不断地移开。她今天必须修剪四个，其中两个看起来像刷子（一种类似麋鹿的生物），两个看起来像Ceratoks（一种类似犀牛的生物）。每种植物只需几分钟就能修剪完毕，但她承认，尽管她一直在学习如何园艺，但她并不是一个植物人，而且它们很胆小。",
	"If the characters explain why they're here and what they want from her, Argona asks them for a favor in exchange for the information they seek–help her cut the topiaries. The characters can accept her deal, or they can instead make a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. On a success, they ply the information from her and leave her to her toils. If the characters mention that they are going to capture her thought in a vial and opt out of helping her, the check is made with disadvantage.": "如果这些角色解释了他们在这里的原因以及他们想从她那里得到什么，Argona就会要求他们帮一个忙，以换取他们所寻求的信息--帮助她砍掉这些拓印植物。人物可以接受她的交易，或者他们可以进行DC15魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查。如果成功，他们就会从她那里得到信息，然后让她去干她的活。如果人物提到他们将在小瓶中捕获她的思想，并选择不帮助她，那么检查将以劣势进行。",
	"There are four topiaries–two are brushstriders ({@creature awakened shrub||animated shrubs}) and two are ceratoks ({@creature awakened tree||animated trees}). In order to successfully get close to trim them, a character can attempt one of the following methods:": "一共有四个拓片--两个是刷子蜘蛛（{@creature awakened shrub||animated shrubs}），两个是瑟拉托克（{@creature awakened tree||animated trees}）。为了成功接近修剪它们，一个角色可以尝试以下方法之一。",
