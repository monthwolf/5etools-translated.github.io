	"Welcome to {@i Tales from the Yawning Portal}. Within this book you will find seven of the deadliest dungeons from the history of D&D, updated for the current edition of the game. Some are classics that have hosted an untold number of adventurers, while others are newer creations boldly staking their place in the pantheon of notable D&D adventures.": "欢迎来到{@i Tales from the Yawning Portal}。在这本书中，你会发现D&D历史上最致命的七个地牢，并为当前版本的游戏进行了更新。有些是承载了无数冒险者的经典之作，而其他的则是较新的创作，大胆地在著名的D&D冒险圣殿中占据了一席之地。",
	"Just as these dungeons have made an impression on D&D players, so too have tales of their dangers spread across the D&D multiverse. When the night grows long in Waterdeep, City of Splendors, and the fireplace in the taproom of the Yawning Portal dims to a deep crimson, adventurers from across the Sword Coast-and even some visiting from other D&D worlds-spin tales and rumors of lost treasures.": "正如这些地牢给D&D玩家留下的印象一样，关于其危险的故事也在D&D多元宇宙中传播。当辉煌之城沃特迪普的夜色渐浓，打哈欠之门酒馆的壁炉暗淡成深红色时，来自整个剑海岸的冒险者--甚至是一些来自其他D&D世界的来访者，都在传颂着关于丢失宝藏的故事和传闻。",
	"A wanderer from the distant Shou Empire speaks of strange, leering devil faces carved in dungeon walls that can devour an explorer in an instant, leaving behind not a single trace of the poor soul's passing.": "一个来自遥远的寿氏帝国的流浪者说，在地牢的墙壁上雕刻着奇怪的、淫荡的魔鬼面孔，可以在瞬间吞噬一个探险者，不留下一个可怜的灵魂经过的痕迹。",
	"A bald, stern wizard clad in blue robes and speaking with a strange accent tells of a wizard who claimed three powerful weapons from a city on the shores of a lake of unknown depths, who spirited them away to a slumbering volcano and dared adventurers to enter his lair and recover them.": "一个身穿蓝色长袍、说话带着奇怪口音的秃头严厉的巫师讲述了一个巫师从一个不知名的深湖岸边的城市领走了三件强大的武器，他把这些武器带到了一座沉睡的火山，并让冒险家们敢于进入他的巢穴并找回这些武器。",
	"A one-eyed dwarf spins tales of a castle that fell into the earth, and whose ruins stand above a subterranean grove dominated by a tree that spawns evil.": "一个独眼矮人讲述了一个坠入地底的城堡的故事，其废墟矗立在一个地下小树林之上，该小树林由一棵孕育邪恶的树主导。",
	"These are only a few of the tales that have spread across the Sword Coast from the furthest reaches of Faerûn and beyond. The minor details change with the telling. The dread tomb of Acererak shifts its location from a dismal swamp, to a searing desert, to some other forbidding clime in each telling. The key elements remain the same in each version of the tales, lending a thread of truth to the tale.": "这些只是从法鲁恩最远的地方和其他地方传遍剑海岸的几个故事。这些小细节随着故事的进行而改变。可怕的阿塞拉克之墓在每次讲述中都会将其位置从阴暗的沼泽地转移到炙热的沙漠，再转移到其他一些禁忌的气候。在每个版本的故事中，关键因素保持不变，为故事提供了一条真实的线索。",
	"The seeds of those stories now rest in your hand. D&D's deadliest dungeons are now part of your arsenal of adventures. Enjoy, and remember to keep a few spare character sheets handy.": "这些故事的种子现在就在你手中。D&D最致命的地牢现在是你的冒险武器库的一部分。尽情享受吧，并记得保留一些备用的角色表。",
	"Tales from the Yawning Portal contains seven adventures taken from across D&D's history.": "来自哈欠门的故事》包含七个来自D&D历史上的冒险。",

	"These adventures provide the perfect side quest away from your current campaign. If you run published D&D campaigns, such as {@i Storm King's Thunder}, the higher level adventures presented here are an ideal way to extend the campaign beyond.": "这些冒险提供了远离你当前战役的完美副线任务。如果你运行已出版的D&D活动，如{@i Storm King's Thunder}，这里介绍的更高级别的冒险是扩展活动的理想方式。",
	"{@i The Sunless Citadel,} written by Bruce R. Cordell, was the first published adventure for the third edition of the D&D game. It is designed for a party of four or five 1st level player characters.": "{@i The Sunless Citadel,}由Bruce R. Cordell编写，是D&D游戏第三版的第一个出版的冒险。它是为四个或五个一级玩家角色的聚会设计的。",

Those who survive the experience can expect to advance to 5th level—seasoned adventurers ready to strive for greater glory and renown.": "与前作一样，{@i The Forge of Fury}也是为人物在要塞中前进的过程中提供越来越强的威胁而量身定做的。那些活下来的人可望晋级到第五级--经验丰富的冒险家，准备为更大的荣耀和名声而奋斗。",
	"{@i The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan,} written by Harold Johnson and Jeff R. Leason, made its debut under the title {@i Lost Tamoachan} at the Origins game convention in 1979, where it was used in the official D&D competition. The first published version of the adventure was produced in 1980.": "{@i The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan,}由Harold Johnson和Jeff R. Leason编写，在1979年的起源游戏大会上以{@i Lost Tamoachan}的标题首次亮相，并被用于官方的D&D竞赛。该冒险的第一个出版版本是在1980年制作的。",

	"The three linked adventures that make up {@i Against the Giants} were created and originally released in 1978, during the time when Gary Gygax was still writing the {@i Player's Handbook} for the original AD&D game. Despite being (in a sense) older than the game itself, these adventures continue to hold a special place in the hearts and memories of D&D players of all ages.": "构成{@i Against the Giants}的三个链接的冒险故事是在1978年创作并最初发布的，当时Gary Gygax还在为最初的AD&D游戏编写{@i Player's Handbook}。尽管（从某种意义上说）比游戏本身还要古老，但这些冒险在所有年龄段的D&D玩家心中仍然占有特殊的地位和记忆。",
	"The compilation of {@i Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl}, and {@i Hall of the Fire Giant King} was published in 1981 as {@i Against the Giants}. The version presented here is designed to be undertaken by characters of 11th level.": "{@i Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl}和{@i Hall of the Fire Giant King}的汇编在1981年作为{@i Against the Giants}出版。这里介绍的版本是为11级的人物所设计的。",
	"The first version of the adventure was crafted for Gary Gygax's personal campaign in the early 1970s and went on to be featured as the official Dungeons & Dragons event at the original Origins gaming convention in 1975. The first publication of {@i Tomb of Horrors}, as a part of the Advanced D&D game, came in 1978.": "该冒险的第一个版本是在1970年代早期为Gary Gygax的个人活动精心设计的，并在1975年最初的起源游戏大会上作为官方龙与地下城活动的特色。作为高级D&D游戏的一部分，{@i Tomb of Horrors}的首次出版是在1978年。",
	"As a proving ground for characters and players alike, fabricated by the devious mind of the game's cocreator, Tomb of Horrors has no equal in the annals of D&D's greatest adventures. Only high-level characters stand a chance of coming back alive, but every player who braves the Tomb will have the experience of a lifetime.": "作为一个由游戏创造者的邪恶思想所创造的角色和玩家的试验场，恐怖之墓在D&D最伟大的冒险史上是无与伦比的。只有高级别的角色才有机会活着回来，但每一个勇闯古墓的玩家都会有一生难忘的经历。",
	"Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.": "出现在这样的方框中的文字是为了让玩家在他们的角色第一次到达某个地点或在某个特定情况下大声朗读或转述，如文中所述。",
	"The {@i Monster Manual} contains stat blocks for most of the monsters and NPCs found in this book. When a monster's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block in the Monster Manual. Descriptions and stat blocks for new monsters appear in appendix B. If a stat block is in that appendix, an adventure's text tells you so.": "{@i Monster Manual}包含本书中大多数怪物和NPC的状态块。当一个怪物的名字以{@b bold}的字体出现时，那是一个视觉提示，指向怪物手册中该生物的状态块。新怪物的描述和状态块出现在附录B中。如果一个状态块在该附录中，冒险的文本会告诉你。",
	"While these adventures were never meant to be combined into a full campaign-over 30 years separates the newest from the oldest-they have been selected to provide play across a broad range of levels. With a little work, you can run a complete campaign using only this book.": "虽然这些冒险从来都不是为了组合成一个完整的战役--最新的和最老的相隔30多年--但它们被选来提供广泛的等级游戏。只要稍加努力，你就可以只用这本书开展一个完整的活动。",
	"Starting with The Sunless Citadel, guide your players through the adventures in the order that they are presented in this book. Each one provides enough XP that, upon completing the adventure, the characters should be high enough level to advance to the next one.": "从《无日城堡》开始，引导你的玩家按照本书中的顺序完成冒险。每一个冒险都提供了足够的XP，在完成冒险后，角色应该有足够高的等级来进入下一个冒险。",
	"The Yawning Portal, or some other tavern of your own invention or drawn from another D&D setting, provides the perfect framing device for the campaign. The characters hear rumors of each dungeon, with just enough information available to lead them to the next adventure. Perhaps a friendly NPC drawn from the upcoming adventure visits the tavern in search of help, or some element of a character's background pushes the group down the proper road. In any case, these dungeons are designed to be easily portable to any campaign setting.": "Yawning Portal，或其他你自己发明的或来自其他D&D设定的酒馆，为活动提供了完美的框架装置。角色们听到了每个地牢的传闻，有足够的信息来引导他们进行下一次冒险。也许一个从即将到来的冒险中抽出的友好的NPC会到酒馆寻求帮助，或者一个角色的背景的某些元素会把他们推到正确的道路上。在任何情况下，这些地牢的设计都可以很容易地移植到任何活动环境中。",
	"Amid the bustle of Waterdeep, within the Castle Ward where barristers, nobles, and emissaries battle with word and contract, stands an inn not quite like any other. Before there was a Castle Ward or even what could be recognized as an ancestor of the City of Splendors, there was a dungeon, and in that dungeon begins the tale of the Yawning Portal.": "在沃特迪普的喧嚣中，在大律师、贵族和使者们用言语和契约战斗的城堡区，矗立着一家与其他地方不太一样的旅馆。在没有城堡区或者甚至可以被认为是辉煌之城的祖先之前，有一个地牢，而在那个地牢里，打哈欠的门的故事开始了。",
	"In ages past, the mighty wizard Halaster built his tower at the foot of Mount Waterdeep and delved deep into tunnels first built by dwarves and drow in search of ever greater magical power. Halaster and his apprentices expanded the tunnels they found, worming out new lairs under the surface for reasons of their own. In time, their excavations grew into the vast labyrinth known today as Undermountain, the largest dungeon in all of the Forgotten Realms. Halaster eventually disappeared, as have all his apprentices, but the massive complex he built remains to this day.": "在过去的岁月里，强大的巫师哈拉斯特在沃特德普山脚下建造了他的塔，并深入到最初由矮人和乌鸦建造的隧道中，寻找更强大的魔法力量。哈拉斯特和他的学徒们扩大了他们所发现的隧道，出于他们自己的原因在地表下挖出了新的巢穴。随着时间的推移，他们的挖掘工作逐渐发展成为今天被称为 \"地下山 \"的巨大迷宫，这是整个被遗忘之域中最大的地牢。哈拉斯特最终消失了，他的所有学徒也都消失了，但他建造的巨大建筑群至今仍在。",
	"For untold years, the secrets of Undermountain remained hidden from the surface world. Everyone who entered its halls failed to return. Its reputation as a death trap grew to the point that criminals in Waterdeep who were sentenced to die were forcibly escorted into the dungeon and left to fend for themselves.": "无数年来，地下山的秘密一直被隐藏在地面世界。所有进入其大厅的人都没有回来。它作为死亡陷阱的名声越来越大，以至于在沃特迪普被判处死刑的罪犯被强行押入地牢，任其自生自灭。",
	"All of that changed with the arrival of two men, a warrior named Durnan and a ne'er-do-well named Mirt. The duo were the first adventurers to return from Undermountain, laden with riches and magic treasures. While Mirt used his wealth to buy a mansion, Durnan had different plans. Durnan retired from adventuring and purchased the land on which sat the deep, broad well that was the only known entrance to the dungeon. Around this well he built a tavern and inn that caters to adventurers and those who seek their services, and he called it the Yawning Portal.": "这一切都随着两个人的到来而改变，一个叫杜南的战士和一个叫米特的新教徒。这两个人是第一批从地下山回来的冒险家，满载着财富和魔法宝藏。米特用他的财富买了一座豪宅，而杜南则有不同的计划。杜南从冒险中退休，并购买了土地，那里有一口又深又宽的井，是地牢唯一已知的入口。围绕这口井，他建造了一个酒馆和旅店，以满足冒险者和那些寻求他们服务的人的需求，他把它称为打哈欠的入口。",
	"Some of the magic Durnan looted on his successful foray into Undermountain granted him a life span that exceeds even that of an elf. And for decades Durnan left delving into Undermountain to younger folk. Yet one day, something drew him back. Days of waiting for his triumphant return from the dungeon turned to months and then years. For nearly a century, citizens of Waterdeep thought him dead. But one night, a voice called up from the well. Few at first believed it could be Durnan, but folk as long-lived as he vouched it so. The Yawning Portal had passed into the hands of his ancestors, but Durnan returned with enough riches for them to quietly retire. Durnan took his customary place behind the bar, raised a toast to his own safe return, and then began serving customers as if he'd never left.": "杜南在成功进入地下山时掠夺的一些魔法使他的寿命甚至超过了精灵的寿命。几十年来，杜南把深入地下山的工作留给了年轻的人们。然而有一天，有东西吸引他回来了。等待他从地牢中凯旋的日子变成了几个月，然后是几年。近一个世纪以来，沃特德普的公民都认为他已经死了。但有一天晚上，一个声音从井里叫了起来。起初很少有人相信这可能是杜南，但和他一样长寿的人都证明了这一点。曙光之门已经落入他的祖先手中，但杜南带着足够的财富回来，让他们悄悄退休。杜南在酒吧后面找到了他习惯的位置，为自己的安全返回举杯，然后开始为顾客服务，就像他从未离开一样。",
	"Adventurers from across Faerûn, and even from elsewhere in the great span of the multiverse, visit the Yawning Portal to exchange knowledge about Undermountain and other dungeons. Most visitors are content to swap stories by the hearth, but sometimes a group driven by greed, ambition, or desperation pays the toll for entry and descends the well. Most don't survive to make the return trip, but enough come back with riches and tales of adventure to tempt other groups into trying their luck.": "来自法鲁恩各地的冒险者，甚至是来自多元宇宙其他地方的冒险者，都会来拜访打哈欠的入口，交流关于地下山和其他地牢的知识。大多数来访者都满足于在壁炉旁交换故事，但有时一群人在贪婪、野心或绝望的驱使下，会支付进入的费用并下井。大多数人都没能活到回程，但有足够的人带着财富和冒险故事回来，引诱其他团体尝试他们的运气。",
	"The Yawning Portal is not the only renowned tavern in D&D lore. In the Free City of Greyhawk stands the Green Dragon Inn, which has been the starting point for some of the most successful expeditions to Castle Greyhawk and beyond. The place is crowded and smoke-filled. Patrons talk in low voices, and anyone attempting to strike up a conversation without making a clear intent to pay can expect a cold reception. Paranoia and suspicion run rampant here, as befits a free city that stands at the nexus between a devil-haunted empire, a vast domain locked in the irontight grip of a demigod of evil, and a splintered, bickering host of kingdoms nominally committed to justice and weal. In the battered, weary world of Greyhawk, profit and power take precedence over heroics.": "Yawning Portal并不是D&D传说中唯一著名的酒馆。在灰鹰的自由城，矗立着绿龙客栈，它是一些最成功的远征灰鹰堡和其他地方的起点。这个地方很拥挤，烟雾缭绕。顾客们用低沉的声音交谈，任何试图在没有明确的付款意向的情况下进行交谈的人都会受到冷遇。妄想症和怀疑在这里肆虐，这与一个自由的城市相称，它站在一个被魔鬼困扰的帝国、一个被邪恶的半神牢牢控制的广阔领域，以及一个分裂的、争吵的、名义上致力于正义和福利的王国之间的交界处。在灰鹰这个疲惫不堪的世界里，利益和权力高于英雄主义。",
	"The Yawning Portal's taproom fills the first floor of the building. The 40-foot-diameter well that provides access to Undermountain dominates the space. The \"well\" is all that remains of Halaster's tower, and now, devoid of the stairways and floors that formed subterranean levels, it drops as an open shaft for 140 feet. Stirges, spiders, and worse have been known to invade the Yawning Portal from below.": "Yawning Portal的自来水室占满了建筑的第一层。直径40英尺的井提供了通往地下山的通道，占据了整个空间。这口 \"井 \"是哈拉斯特塔的全部遗迹，现在，没有了形成地下楼层的楼梯和地板，它就像一个开放的竖井一样下降了140英尺。据了解，搅屎棍、蜘蛛和更坏的东西都会从下面入侵打哈欠的门户。",
	"Balconies on the tavern's second and third floors overlook the well, with those floors accessed by way of wooden stairs that rise up from the taproom. Guests sitting at the tables on the balconies have an excellent view of the well and the action below.": "酒馆二楼和三楼的阳台可以俯瞰水井，通过从酒水间升起的木质楼梯进入这两层。坐在阳台上的桌子旁的客人可以看到水井和下面的活动，视野极佳。",
	"Those who wish to enter Undermountain for adventure (or the daring tourists who just want to \"ride the rope\") must pay a gold piece to be lowered down. The return trip also costs a piece of gold, sent up in a bucket in advance. Once the initial payment is made, a few stairs takes one to the top of the waisthigh lip of the well. The rope that hangs in the center of the well is levered over to the lip by a beam in the rafters, and when those who have paid are ready, they mount the rope and take the long ride down.": "那些想进入山下探险的人（或只是想 \"骑绳 \"的大胆游客）必须支付一块金子才能被放下去。回程也要付一块金子，事先用桶装好送上去。一旦支付了最初的费用，走几步楼梯就可以到达井口的腰部。悬挂在井中央的绳索被椽子上的横梁撬到了井口，当那些已经付款的人准备好了，他们就登上绳索，长途跋涉下去。",
	"A staggering variety of curios and oddities adorn the taproom. Traditionally, adventurers who recover a strange relic from Undermountain present it to Durnan as a trophy of their success. Other adventurers leave such curios to mark their visits to the tavern, or relinquish them after losing a bet with Durnan, who likes to wager on the fate of adventuring bands that enter the dungeon. Occasionally, something that strikes Durnan's fancy can be used to pay a bar tab.": "各种各样的奇珍异宝装饰着这个酒馆。传统上，冒险者如果从地下山找回了一件奇怪的遗物，就会把它送给杜南，作为他们成功的战利品。其他冒险者会留下这样的古玩来纪念他们对酒馆的访问，或者在与杜南打赌失败后放弃它们，杜南喜欢对进入地牢的冒险队伍的命运下注。偶尔，杜南看中的东西可以用来支付酒吧的帐单。",

	"On quiet nights, guests in the Yawning Portal gather around a large fireplace in the taproom and swap tales of distant places, strange monsters, and valuable treasures. On busier nights, the place is loud and crowded. The balconies overflow with merchants and nobles, while the tables on the ground floor are filled with adventurers and their associates. Invariably, the combination of a few drinks and the crowd's encouragement induces some folk to pay for a brief trip down into Undermountain. Most folk pay in advance for a ride down and immediately back up, though a few ambitious souls might launch impromptu expeditions into the dungeon. Few such ill-prepared parties ever return.": "在安静的夜晚，\"打哈欠门户 \"的客人们聚集在自来水间的大壁炉旁，交换关于遥远地方、奇怪的怪物和宝贵的宝藏的故事。在比较繁忙的夜晚，这里就会变得喧闹而拥挤。阳台上挤满了商人和贵族，而一楼的桌子上则坐满了冒险家和他们的伙伴。几杯酒加上众人的鼓励，总能诱使一些人花钱到山下做一次短暂的旅行。大多数人都是先付钱，然后马上回来，不过也有几个雄心勃勃的人可能会临时进入地牢探险。这种准备不足的队伍很少有机会回来。",
	"Groups seeking to enter Undermountain for a specific reason generally come to the tavern during its quiet hours. Even at such times, there are still a few prying eyes in the taproom, lurkers who carry news of the comings and goings from Undermountain to the Zhentarim, dark cults, criminal gangs, and other interested parties.": "因特殊原因想进入暗山的团体一般都是在酒馆安静的时候来的。即使在这种时候，酒馆里仍然有一些窥探的目光，这些潜伏者将地下山的来往消息传递给镇塔林、黑暗教派、犯罪团伙和其他感兴趣的人。",
	"Kicking off a dungeon adventure can be as simple as having a mysterious stranger offer the characters a quest while they are at the Yawning Portal (or some other tavern).

	"Durnan is a man of few words.

Despite his stony heart, he is an excellent source of information about Undermountain and other dungeons, provided one can pay his price.": "杜南是一个寡言的人。他希望自己的时间能得到回报，只有在得到硬性现金的情况下才会提供见解和传言。他说：\"我们知道机会，并抓住我们的机会。\"不管他是在打断一场变成暴力的牌局，还是拒绝被困在井底的冒险者的请求，因为他们无力支付上来的费用。尽管他的心很冷漠，但他是关于地下山和其他地牢的绝佳信息来源，只要人们能支付他的价格。",

	"Giants have been raiding civilized lands in bands, with giants of different sorts in these marauding groups. Death and destruction have been laid heavily upon every place these monsters have visited. This has caused great anger in high places, for life and property loss means failure of the vows of noble rulers to protect the life and goods of each and every subject—and possible lean times for the rulers as well as the ruled. Therefore, a party of the bravest and most powerful adventurers has been assembled and given the charge to punish the miscreant giants. Characters whose homes lay in the devastated land probably need little more motivation to face their oppressors.": "巨人一直在成群结队地袭击文明的土地，在这些掠夺的群体中，有不同种类的巨人。这些怪物所到之处，死亡和破坏都很严重。这在高层引起了极大的愤怒，因为生命和财产的损失意味着高贵的统治者保护每一个臣民的生命和财产的誓言的失败，也意味着统治者和被统治者可能会陷入困境。因此，一支由最勇敢、最强大的冒险家组成的队伍被召集起来，负责惩治那些不守规矩的巨人。那些家在被破坏的土地上的角色可能不需要更多的动力来面对他们的压迫者。",
	"This is a series of three linked adventures. It is designed for a group of four or five player characters of 11th level. If the characters persevere, they are likely to advance in level at the end of each section of the story. Only strong and experienced characters should adventure into these giants' areas if the party consists of no more than four characters. The characters should have magic items to help them overcome the challenges they face. For a small party, the most important qualities are experience and caution. A group of four well-played characters can expect a reasonable chance of survival if they use their knowledge and cunning to best advantage.": "这是一个由三个相连的冒险系列。它是为四或五个11级的玩家角色设计的。如果角色坚持下去，他们有可能在故事的每个部分结束时提升等级。如果队伍由不超过四个角色组成，那么只有强壮且有经验的角色才应该进入这些巨人的区域冒险。角色们应该有魔法物品来帮助他们克服面临的挑战。对于一个小队伍来说，最重要的素质是经验和谨慎。一组四个玩得好的角色，如果他们把自己的知识和狡猾发挥到极致，可以期待有合理的生存机会。",
	"These adventures were designed for strategic play, so some areas of the giant settlements are very dangerous even for characters of the recommended level. Further, adventurers who call too much attention to themselves are likely to be doomed. It takes only one or two extra giants in an encounter to turn a manageable situation into a very deadly one.": "这些冒险是为战略游戏而设计的，所以即使对于推荐等级的角色来说，巨型定居点的某些区域也是非常危险的。此外，冒险者如果过于关注自己，很可能会遭到灭顶之灾。在一场遭遇战中，只需要一两个额外的巨人，就可以把一个可以控制的情况变成一个非常致命的情况。",
	"Therefore, be free with information the players need to make informed decisions. For example, any seasoned adventurer can see that the giants in the great hall of the steading represent an overwhelming challenge. So, the question becomes how to accomplish punishing the giants and discovering what is influencing them without having to face so many at once. The adventure contains some possible answers.": "因此，要免费提供玩家做出明智决定所需的信息。例如，任何一个经验丰富的冒险家都可以看到，在大棚的大殿里的巨人是一个巨大的挑战。因此，问题变成了如何完成对巨人的惩罚，并发现影响他们的因素，而又不必同时面对这么多的巨人。这场冒险包含了一些可能的答案。",
	"Keep track of the fate of important giants and their allies or captives. Escaping adversaries will generally flee to the next higher-ranking stronghold (from the steading to the rift and from the rift to Snurre's hall); freed captives may join forces with their rescuers (this is a good way to introduce replacement player characters). This assumes survival of the individuals, of course, as well as opportunity for them to act. Some provision for the movement of surviving giants is given in the latter scenarios, but you will have to modify these according to the outcome of previous adventuring by your group.": "追踪重要巨人及其盟友或俘虏的命运。逃跑的对手一般会逃到下一个更高级的据点（从堡垒到裂缝，从裂缝到Snurre大厅）；被释放的俘虏可能会与他们的救援者联合起来（这是介绍替代玩家角色的好方法）。当然，这是以个人的生存为前提的，同时也为他们提供了行动的机会。后面的场景中对幸存的巨人的行动做了一些规定，但你必须根据你的团队以前的冒险结果来修改这些规定。",
	"The preferred habitats of {@creature Hill Giant||hill giants}, {@creature Frost Giant||frost giants}, and {@creature Fire Giant||fire giants} exist in virtually every D&D setting, so it's not too difficult to find locations for the strongholds and the events in {@i Against the Giants}.": "{@creature Hill Giant||hill giants}、{@creature Frost Giant||frost giants}和{@creature Fire Giant||fire giants}的首选栖息地几乎存在于每一个D&D设定中，所以要为据点和{@i Against the Giants}的事件找到位置并不难。",
	"On Krynn, the alliance of giants could center on the Kharolis Mountains, bringing Abanasinia, Qualinesti, Thorbardin, Kharolis, and Tarsis into the conflict. The ultimate villains in the Dragonlance setting would have to be dark exiles of an even more unexpected sort than those described in this adventure.": "在克莱恩，巨人联盟可以以卡洛斯山脉为中心，将阿巴纳西尼亚、奎林斯蒂、索尔巴丁、卡洛斯和塔西斯纳入冲突。在《龙之谷》的设定中，最终的反派必须是黑暗流亡者，其种类甚至比这次冒险中所描述的更出人意料。",
	"The giant conspiracy could have its roots in faraway Xen'drik, with an outpost in Breland serving as the hill giant steading. Or the giants could be from Droaam, perhaps acting against the wishes of the Daughters of Sora Kell due to another sinister influence.": "巨人的阴谋可能扎根于遥远的Xen'drik，在Breland的一个前哨作为山地巨人的大本营。或者，这些巨人可能来自德罗安（Droaam），也许是由于另一种阴险的影响而违背了索拉-凯尔之女的意愿而行动。",
	"In Faerûn, the giants could be raiding the Sword Coast after emerging from the Sword Mountains or the Sunset Mountains or the Spine of the World. They might be preparing to move on Damara from out of the Galena Mountains, or to descend upon the Dalelands and Cormyr from the Stormhorns or the Thunder Peaks.": "在法鲁恩，巨人可能会在从剑山、落日山脉或世界之脊出来后袭击剑海岸。他们可能正准备从加莱纳山脉向达玛拉进发，或者从风暴之角或雷霆之峰降临达利兰和考密尔。",

	"If you want to add some variability to the encounters in these adventures, a good way to do this is by modifying the armor and weapons the giants use. In particular, the servants and the young that are found among the giants might not be outfitted with the gear described in the statistics used for them. Servants could use improvised weapons, such as giant-sized tools and utensils they have available. If you decide to change any giant's melee weapon to some other giant-sized weapon, adjust its damage accordingly: Huge giants deal three times normal weapon damage, and Large giants, such as ogres, deal twice normal weapon damage.": "如果你想给这些冒险中的遭遇增加一些变化，一个很好的方法是修改巨人使用的盔甲和武器。特别是，在巨人中发现的仆人和年轻人可能没有配备用于他们的统计数据中所描述的装备。仆人们可以使用即兴的武器，比如他们所拥有的巨人大小的工具和器皿。如果你决定将任何巨人的近战武器改为其他巨人大小的武器，请相应调整其伤害。巨大的巨人会造成正常武器伤害的三倍，而大型巨人，如食人魔，会造成正常武器伤害的两倍。",
	"When a giant uses the statistics of an ogre, that creature might use throwing rocks for ranged attacks (assuming any are on hand) rather than the ogre's standard weaponry. If projectiles are available, throwing rocks is always a giant's best (and preferred) ranged attack.": "当一个巨人使用食人魔的统计数据时，该生物可能会使用投掷石块进行远程攻击（假设手上有任何石块），而不是食人魔的标准武器。如果有投射物，投掷石块总是巨人最好的（也是首选的）远程攻击。",
	"{@i Against the Giants}, by Gary Gygax, was originally produced in 1981 as a compilation of three adventures written in the earliest days of the game. Those adventures were created and originally released in 1978, during the time when Gary Gygax was still writing the {@i Player's Handbook} for the original AD&D game. Despite being (in a sense) older than the game itself, these adventures continue to hold a special place in the hearts and memories of D&D players of all ages.": "{@i Against the Giants}，由Gary Gygax编写，最初是在1981年制作的，是在游戏最早期编写的三个冒险的汇编。这些冒险是在1978年创作并最初发行的，当时Gary Gygax还在为最初的AD&D游戏编写(%%1)。尽管（从某种意义上说）比游戏本身还要古老，但这些冒险在所有年龄段的D&D玩家心中仍然占有特殊的地位和记忆。",
	"Many opportunities arise throughout these adventures for the characters to search miscellaneous bags and chests that belong to giants. The contents of these containers can be determined randomly by using the following table. Roll {@dice 3d4} to determine the number of different items among the contents, then roll {@dice d100} for each item and refer to the table to determine its nature. Either apply the result of the roll or use it as inspiration for something along the same lines.": "在这些冒险中，有很多机会让人物去搜索属于巨人的杂物袋和箱子。这些容器的内容可以通过以下表格随机确定。掷出{@dice 3d4}来确定内容物中不同物品的数量，然后为每个物品掷出{@dice d100}，并参照表格来确定其性质。你可以应用掷骰子的结果，也可以用它作为灵感来做同样的事情。",

There will inevitably be player actions which the script has not anticipated, and you will have to judge their results.

	"Remember also that these giants are not only the toughest so far encountered but also have the best advice immediately available to them. As soon as the party strikes and then retires, the attack will be assessed and countermeasures taken. Even when the party first enters the hall, you will have to gauge the reaction of the giants if and when they learn that intruders are within. How will they react? From whence will they call in guards? Where will Snurre go? Most assuredly, he will not remain seated upon his throne when an attack is in progress!

While the characters offered no quarter and slew every giant or other creature encountered with absolute ruthlessness, their opponents fought with reckless abandon and self-sacrifice.": "当队伍从大厅里退下来休息时，火巨人会在这种情况下布置他们所能准备的任何陷阱和伏击。灯光会被扼杀，哨兵会被派上用场，等等。在最初的游戏测试中，在（特别强壮和玩得好的）一方的第一次闯入中幸存下来的巨人设置了几个埋伏，每个惊喜的时间都是为了让他们在通道的转弯处或通过一组门迅速撤退，逐渐退回到通往下层的走廊。虽然角色们不留情面，并以绝对无情的方式杀死了遇到的每一个巨人或其他生物，但他们的对手却以鲁莽的放弃和自我牺牲的方式战斗。",

Once the wire is found, it can be avoided, but cutting it sets off the ballista.

(these chime tubes are hollow and are worth 100 gp each).": "第一层的地板是黑色的石头，上面有紫色的纹路。第一层的西侧放着一个由发黑的皮肤和壳质材料组成的大鼓。东边有一个架子，上面挂着九个银色的圆柱体，显然是一套风铃。(这些风铃管是空心的，每个价值100金币）。",
	"The second tier is dark gray stone, with specks of lilac and orange and purple. It holds a huge stone altar block of dull, porous-looking, somewhat rust-colored black mineral. To either side of the altar are large bronze braziers whose corroded green coloration is particularly nauseating in this setting. Flanking the braziers, in the form of triangles pointing downward, are two sets of candelabra, each candelabrum having three branches. These are made of bronze that is green with age, and each branch holds a fat black candle that burns with a flame of leaping lavender and deep glowing purple but never grows shorter.": "第二层是深灰色的石头，有紫丁香和橙紫色的斑点。它放着一个巨大的石坛块，看起来暗淡无光，多孔，有点锈色的黑色矿物。祭坛的两侧是大型青铜火炉，其腐蚀的绿色在这种环境中特别令人作呕。炉子的两侧是两组烛台，呈三角形朝下，每个烛台有三个分支。这些都是由青铜制成的，因年代久远而呈绿色，每根枝条上都有一根肥大的黑色蜡烛，燃烧着跳跃的薰衣草和深紫色的火焰，但从未变短。",
	"If the drum on the first tier is beaten, the chimes are rung, and the triangle is struck while the altar is in this translucent state, a glowing golden eye swims into view in the stone's writhing center. For each creature that sees the eye, roll a {@dice d12} and consult the following table. The creature is affected as if by a {@spell symbol} spell of the indicated type (save DC 15):": "如果在祭坛处于这种半透明状态时，第一层的鼓被敲响，风铃被敲响，三角板被敲响，一只发光的金色眼睛就会在石头蠕动的中心游进视野。对于每一个看到这只眼睛的生物，掷一个{@dice d12}，并参考以下表格。该生物会受到一个指定类型的{@spell symbol}法术的影响（保存DC15）。",

	"If the three {@item Tentacle Rod||tentacle rods} from {@adventure area 12|TftYP-AtG|1|12.

Then a tentacle comes out of the altar and grabs the nearest living creature. The tentacle has a reach of 20 feet and a +11 bonus to hit. A creature hit by the tentacle is drawn into the stone—totally gone, destroyed.": "如果当眼睛出现时，来自{@adventure area 12|TftYP-AtG|1|12. Drow Clerics' Area}的三个{@item Tentacle Rod||tentacle rods}在人物身上，并且火炉保持点燃，那么祭坛就会成为召唤上古元素神的手段--它变成透明的日光岩颜色，中心的黑块变大并呈现紫色的肿胀血管，而眼睛则是火红的橘色。然后一条触手从祭坛里出来，抓住最近的生物。触手的伸长距离为20英尺，命中率为+11。被触手击中的生物会被卷入石块中--完全消失，被摧毁。",
	"If a creature is drawn into the altar, the altar returns to its dormant state, and atop it will be the thing most wished for by the party—or something that will enable the characters to attain the end or state they most desire.": "如果一个生物被吸引到祭坛中，祭坛就会恢复到休眠状态，在它上面会出现当事人最希望得到的东西--或者能使角色达到他们最渴望的目的或状态的东西。",
	"If a second summoning of this Elder Elemental God is attempted within the same day, roll a {@dice d12} and apply the indicated result from the table below.": "如果在同一天内试图第二次召唤这个上古元素之神，请掷出{@dice d12}，并从下表中应用指定结果。",

	"The chamber south of the wall is lit by the same everburning black candles that are found in the temple ({@adventure area 11|TftYP-AtG|1|11. Priests' Area}), so the illumination is eerie and dim.

	"A smoldering copper brazier near the door gives off an incense-like smoke that is sweet, cloying, decayed-smelling, disgusting, alluring, and euphoric all at once. In the candlelit room are two low black couches, each inlaid with silver. To one side sit a round table and two armchairs. At the foot of each couch is a low table with a basin and ewer made of jasper. Small stools and enameled coffers provide a bit of decoration.": "靠近门口的一个燃烧着的铜火炉散发出一种类似于香的烟雾，它是甜美的、令人陶醉的、有腐烂气味的、令人厌恶的、诱人的，同时也是令人兴奋的。在烛光闪耀的房间里，有两张黑色的低矮沙发，每张沙发上都镶嵌着银子。一边是一张圆桌和两把扶手椅。每张沙发的脚下都有一张矮桌，上面放着碧玉制成的盆子和水壶。小凳子和搪瓷棺材提供了一些装饰。",

	"Here the light from candles is supplemented by two small braziers of black and silver. Tapestries of a suggestive nature adorn the walls. The furnishings include a large bed, two small tables, three coffers, a buffet, a cabinet, a large wardrobe, two divans with a low chest between them, a dressing table and chair, a large mirror, two hampers, and two chests. All furnishings are of ebony or black stone, and most have silver inlay. The wardrobe holds feminine clothing and the priestess's vestments of mauve, black, and plum, stitched with gold.": "在这里，蜡烛的光线由两个黑色和银色的小火炉来补充。墙上挂着具有暗示性的挂毯。家具包括一张大床、两张小桌、三个棺材、一个自助餐、一个橱柜、一个大衣柜、两张夹着矮柜的沙发、一张梳妆台和椅子、一面大镜子、两个行李箱和两个箱子。所有的家具都是乌木或黑石的，大多数都有银色的镶嵌。衣柜里放着女性的衣服和女祭司的法衣，有淡紫色、黑色和梅色，用黄金缝制而成。",
	"A small screen of ebony inlaid with amber (weighing 10 pounds and worth 150 gp) sets off a dressing area in the southeast corner near the wardrobe, where a low-backed chair stands with a gown thrown over it. This screen effectively hides the location of the secret door, which enables the priestess to slip in and out unseen.": "在东南角靠近衣柜的地方，一个镶嵌着琥珀的乌木小屏风（重10磅，价值150金币）衬托出一个穿衣区，那里立着一把低背椅，上面扔着一件长袍。这个屏风有效地隐藏了暗门的位置，使女祭司可以神不知鬼不觉地溜进去和出来。",

	"The entrance to this chamber is protected by a wall of tentacles (not depicted on the map). It appears as rough brown-purple stone. This magic wall is like two {@creature Roper||ropers} combined into one creature, giving it two bite attacks and eight tendrils that it can employ every round (though the tendrils have a range of only 20 feet). The wall has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.
