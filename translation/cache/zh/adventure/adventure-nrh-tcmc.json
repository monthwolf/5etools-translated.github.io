	"Ever jealous of the cheery dispositions and colorful deliciousness of the NERDS, Emo the beholder and his hired muscle, Mr. Greystone, have struck a blow against the NERDS' beloved city of Harmony. After years of searching, the nefarious duo have found the sacred Prismatic Well that gives Harmony its vibrant and fabulous colors. Now, with access to the Prismatic Well, Emo and Mr. Greystone have begun to leech the color from the city of Harmony. If they aren't stopped, the city will gradually turn gray, with everything eventually becoming black and white.": "Emo和他的雇佣兵Greystone先生一直嫉妒NERDS的快乐性格和多彩的美味，他们对NERDS所热爱的城市Harmony进行了打击。经过多年的搜寻，这对邪恶的二人组已经找到了神圣的棱镜井，它赋予了和谐城鲜艳而美妙的色彩。现在，有了进入棱镜井的机会，埃莫和格雷斯通先生开始从和谐城中吸取颜色。如果不阻止他们，这个城市将逐渐变成灰色，所有东西最终都会变成黑色和白色。",
	"To the NERDS, the colors beginning to flicker and drain out of Harmony is an unsettling mystery. What brings the colors to Harmony is an enigma to them. All they can do is hope the power comes back on and restores the vibrancy of Harmony's colors once more. But one group knows what's up, and that group is the Lorekeeper Society—a secret society sworn to protect Harmony. The Lorekeepers know about the power of the Prismatic Well, but its true location is lost even to themselves. However, they have a way to find the well using an ancient artifact known as the Amulet of Harmony, but to activate it they need to find the six Gems of Power. Once activated, the amulet guides whoever controls it to the secret location of the Prismatic Well. But once activated, the amulet also has the power to turn off the well.": "对于NERDS来说，颜色开始闪烁并从Harmony中流失是一个令人不安的谜。是什么给和谐号带来了色彩，对他们来说是个谜。他们所能做的就是希望电力恢复，再次恢复和谐号的色彩活力。但有一个团体知道这是怎么回事，这个团体就是传说守护者协会--一个发誓要保护和谐的秘密团体。传说守护者知道棱镜井的力量，但它的真实位置连他们自己都不知道。然而，他们有办法通过一个被称为 \"和谐护身符 \"的古老神器来找到这口井，但要激活它，他们需要找到六颗力量宝石。一旦激活，护身符会引导控制它的人到达棱镜井的秘密地点。但一旦激活，护身符也有能力关闭水井。",

No one in the Lorekeeper Society knows the details of the magical beasts and traps guarding the gems, but our heroic NERDS are more than up to the challenge of restoring Harmony!": "力量宝石很久以前就被藏在地牢、森林和塔楼里保管起来了。守望者协会中没有人知道守护宝石的魔兽和陷阱的细节，但我们英勇的NERDS足以应对恢复和谐的挑战!",
	"Due to the solo player nature of the adventures (with the exception of Adventure 7 Adventure Together), the power level of some monsters may be difficult with respect to the level of the character. You may want to present a roleplaying solution (such as making friends with the monster or tricking them) to players who are eager to rush into combat. With any encounter in this or subsequent adventures, feel free to present opportunities for unconventional solutions and alternatives to combat.": "由于冒险的单人性质（《冒险7》《一起冒险》除外），一些怪物的力量等级可能与角色的等级有一定的差距。你可能想向那些急于投入战斗的玩家提出一个角色扮演的解决方案（如与怪物交朋友或欺骗它们）。在这次或以后的冒险中遇到的任何情况，都可以自由地提出非常规的解决方案和战斗的替代方案的机会。",

	"After hanging out in the marketplace, Pink meets {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}, who asks them to find and recover the Coral Gem in the abandoned mine under Candy Mountain. {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} gives Pink two ways to get there (as the DM, you may find you like a particular path, so you can choose to have {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} give Pink only one option).": "在市场上闲逛后，粉红遇到了{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}，他要求他们在糖果山下的废弃矿井中找到并收回珊瑚宝石。{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}给了粉红两种方法去那里（作为管理人，你可能会发现你喜欢某条路，所以你可以选择让{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}只给粉红一个选择）。",

	"The adventure begins in the vibrant and colorful city of Harmony where mysterious \"color outages\" are beginning to cause alarm.

	"Here are some other fun activities for Pink:": "这里有一些其他有趣的粉红色活动。",
	"A young NERD, who looks up to Pink, wants to be a great rogue someday. Pink can teach them how to do sleight of hand, pick a lock, put on a disguise to trick a vendor they know, or some other rogue skill like how to do a flip or walk a tightrope. All these skills are DC 10 Dexterity checks (with the corresponding skill like {@skill Acrobatics} or {@skill Sleight of Hand}) and, if successful, amaze the young NERD, increasing their admiration.": "一个仰慕粉红的年轻NERD，希望有一天能成为一个伟大的流氓。粉红可以教他们如何耍花招、开锁、乔装打扮以欺骗他们认识的小贩，或者其他一些流氓技能，比如如何翻跟头或走钢丝。所有这些技能都是DC 10的灵巧检查（相应的技能如{@skill Acrobatics}或{@skill Sleight of Hand}），如果成功，会让年轻的NERD感到惊讶，增加他们的敬佩。",
	"Rose, a merchant who Pink knows well, pulls Pink aside and points to a shady NERD who's stolen some of Rose's prized jollyberries. Rose asks if Pink could steal them back. To do this, Pink must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check to sneak up on the thief and then a successful DC 12 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check to swipe back the jollyberries. A failure on any of these checks can result in the thief attempting to escape or, if cornered, to provoke a fight.": "粉红熟悉的商人罗斯把粉红拉到一边，指着一个阴暗的NERD说，他偷了罗斯一些珍贵的Jollyberries。萝丝问平克能不能把它们偷回来。要做到这一点，粉红必须成功地进行DC 12灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查，以偷袭小偷，然后再成功地进行DC 12灵巧（{@skill Sleight of Hand}）检查，以偷回jollyberries。这些检查中的任何一项失败都会导致小偷试图逃跑，或者如果被逼到墙角，就会挑起一场战斗。",

	"Honeycutt goes on to explain that the Lorekeeper Society needs the Coral Gem recovered. The Society hid the gem for safekeeping centuries ago in the catacombs under Candy Mountain—a once bustling mine that's long since been abandoned—but now they need the gem back. {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} won't go into details about why, only that the gem is needed to solve the mystery of the color outages.": "Honeycutt继续解释说，Lorekeeper协会需要找回珊瑚宝石。协会在几个世纪前将宝石藏在糖果山下的地下墓穴中保管--一个曾经繁华的矿场，现在早已被遗弃，但现在他们需要找回宝石。{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}不会详细说明原因，只说需要这颗宝石来解开颜色缺失之谜。",

	"Hidden behind a fake wall near the central marketplace is the entrance to a secret tunnel that leads all the way to the catacombs under Candy Mountain. {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} says that while this path offers a secret way into the mine, it could be perilous as it's unknown how well the tunnel has held up over the years.": "在中央市场附近的一堵假墙后面，隐藏着一条秘密隧道的入口，它一直通往糖果山下的地下墓穴。{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}说，虽然这条道路提供了进入矿井的秘密途径，但可能会有危险，因为不知道这条隧道多年来的保存情况如何。",

	"As Pink goes deeper along the tunnel, they can see holes in the walls and ceiling. These holes are too small for Pink to crawl into, but big enough for something unpleasant to hide in.": "随着粉红沿着隧道的深入，他们可以看到墙壁和天花板上的洞。这些洞对粉红来说太小了，无法爬进去，但却足以让一些不愉快的东西躲进去。",
	"Ask your player if they're comfortable with scary situations. If not, feel free to make this tunnel a mildly spooky walk in the dark with no monsters or traps. If they enjoy a good scare, then proceed with the adventure as written.": "问问你的玩家，他们是否对可怕的情况感到舒服。如果不喜欢，可以让这条隧道成为一个没有怪物或陷阱的、温和的黑暗中的幽灵之旅。如果他们喜欢惊吓，那么就按规定进行冒险。",
	"The tunnel goes for several miles, so the trek is long, giving you ample opportunity to describe creepy moments when Pink might hear something like scraping, chittering, or scratching—most likely from within the holes dotted throughout the tunnel. When your player is sufficiently creeped out, read the following:": "这条隧道有几英里长，因此，你有足够的机会来描述令人毛骨悚然的时刻，这时粉红可能会听到一些声音，如刮擦声、鸣叫声或抓挠声--很可能是来自遍布整个隧道的洞。当你的玩家被吓得够呛的时候，请阅读下面的内容。",

	"As with anything in Harmony, the chance for friendship is possible. If {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC} is treated with exceptional kindness, offered food, and won over with a successful DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, then a truce is possible and maybe even friendship. You can make this friendship automatic without the need for a roll, if you wish.": "就像在和谐中的任何事情一样，友谊的机会是可能的。如果{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}受到特别的善待，被提供食物，并通过成功的DC14魅力({@skill Persuasion})检查赢得了他，那么休战是可能的，甚至可能是友谊。如果你愿意，你可以让这种友谊自动产生，而不需要进行检定。",

	"There are two traps:": "有两个陷阱。",
	"While navigating the dark tunnel and being harassed by {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}, Pink must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check or fall into the pit, taking 3 ({@damage 1d6}) piercing damage from the spikes. {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC} knows exactly where this pit trap is (and can easily avoid it) and cheers gleefully if Pink falls in. But if Pink manages to avoid the pit, {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}'s curses echo through the tunnel. If Pink falls in, {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC} waits for Pink to climb out and then attacks.": "在黑暗的隧道中航行并受到{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}的骚扰时，粉红必须成功地进行DC14智慧({@skill Perception})检查，否则就会掉进坑里，受到3({@damage 1d6}的尖刺伤害。{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}清楚地知道这个坑的位置（并且可以很容易地避开它），如果粉红掉进去，他会高兴地欢呼。但如果粉红设法避开了这个坑，{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}的诅咒就会在隧道里回响。如果粉红掉进去了，{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}会等着粉红爬出来，然后攻击。",
	"{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}'s directions help Pink find Candy Mountain without much trouble. Pink can either hike through the woods or follow the main road to the entrance of the abandoned mine set into the side of the mountain face.": "{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}的指示帮助粉红找到了糖果山，没有什么麻烦。粉红可以徒步穿过树林，或者沿着大路走到镶嵌在山壁一侧的废弃矿场的入口。",

	"If Pink goes to the main entrance, read the following:": "如果平克去了正门，请阅读以下内容。",

	"Pink can put on a disguise and try to deceive the guards. To pull it off Pink must make a successful DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check. If their disguise is especially creative, Pink has advantage on the roll.": "粉红可以乔装打扮，试图欺骗守卫。为了完成这个任务，粉红必须成功地进行DC14魅力（{@skill Deception}）检查。如果他们的伪装特别有创意，粉红在检查中就有优势。",
	"Pink can create a diversion and then sneak past the guards. Pink must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check. If you feel the diversion is effective, then give Pink advantage on the roll.": "粉红可以制造一个声东击西的机会，然后偷偷溜过守卫。粉红必须成功地进行DC12灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查。如果你觉得声东击西是有效的，那么就给平克在掷骰子上的优势。",

	"If Pink has climbing gear, they gain advantage on the checks.": "如果Pink有攀爬装备，他们在检查中获得优势。",
	"Inside the main gate are many old, dilapidated buildings in various stages of disrepair and collapse. After a brief glance, Pink easily finds the entrance to the mine—a gate made of iron bars secured by a chain and padlock. Picking the lock quietly requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check. On a failure, the door still opens, but the noise alerts the kobolds in area C5d and any nearby guards. Using thieves' tools grants Pink advantage on the roll.": "大门内有许多破旧的建筑，处于不同的失修和倒塌阶段。简单地看了一眼，平克很容易就找到了矿场的入口--一扇用铁链和挂锁锁住的铁栏杆制成的大门。悄悄地撬开锁需要成功地进行DC12灵巧（{@skill Sleight of Hand}）检查。如果失败，门还是会打开，但声音会惊动C5d区的哥布林和附近的守卫。使用盗贼的工具可以使粉红色的优势得到体现。",

	"You see a roughly hewn 30-foot-square room that still has old, rusted picks, shovels, crowbars, a wheelbarrow, and a wooden mining cart in it. Everything is covered with a thick layer of dust and cobwebs. A sloped passage exits to the north. Footprints can be seen all over the floor but most head north.": "你看到一个粗糙的30英尺见方的房间，里面还有生锈的旧镐、铲子、撬棍、一辆手推车和一辆木制矿车。一切都覆盖着一层厚厚的灰尘和蜘蛛网。一条倾斜的通道向北出口。地板上到处都可以看到脚印，但大多数都是往北走。",
	"The wooden mining cart still is operational, but unless Pink oils its wheels before rolling it, the cart makes a terrible racket that alerts the kobolds in area C5d.": "木制采矿车仍然可以使用，但除非平克在滚动它之前给它的轮子上油，否则该车会发出可怕的喧闹声，惊动C5d区的哥布林。",
	"The passageways here are even more roughly hewn and are irregular in their height and width. Here and there along the tunnels are glittering bits of the delicious rock candy that was mined here in days past. In places are puddles of water that are 6 inches or more deep; more than enough to extinguish a dropped torch.": "这里的通道凿得更加粗糙，高度和宽度都不规则。沿着隧道，这里和那里都是过去在这里开采的美味岩糖的闪亮碎片。有些地方有6英寸或更深的水坑；足以熄灭掉落的火把。",
	"Unless the kobolds were alerted, as Pink descends into the mine, they can hear heated chatter coming from the tunnels, but because of the echoing, it isn't clear which ones.": "除非哥布林被惊动了，当平克下到矿井里时，他们可以听到从隧道里传来的激烈的交谈声，但由于有回声，并不清楚是哪一个。",

	"This area has assorted rubble and junk scattered about. The cavern wall has crude hack marks on it, as if someone has been wildly swinging at it with a pickaxe.": "这个区域散落着各种碎石和垃圾。洞壁上有粗糙的砍痕，好像有人用镐头在上面疯狂地挥舞。",
	"The room has nothing of value in it, but if Pink makes a successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, they discover a secret door (see \"Path 1: The Secret Tunnel,\" above) that looks like a boulder set in the wall. The secret door reveals a tunnel that leads all the way back to the city of Harmony.": "这个房间里没有任何有价值的东西，但如果平克成功地进行了DC12智慧({@skill Perception})检查，他们就会发现一个秘密的门（见上面的 \"路径1：秘密隧道\"），看起来像一块镶嵌在墙上的巨石。秘密门揭示了一条隧道，它一直通往和谐城。",
	"This cavern has piles of rubble within it, but there's still a good vein of red rock candy visible in the wall.": "这个洞穴内有成堆的瓦砾，但在墙壁上仍然可以看到很好的红岩糖的矿脉。",
	"If eaten, the rock candy is sweet and delicious. If Pink wants to work for 5 minutes, a pouchful of rock candy worth 5 sp can be mined from the wall. If the kobolds are in area C5d, any noise here alerts them.": "如果吃了，冰糖是甜美可口的。如果平克想工作5分钟，可以从墙上开采出一袋价值5SP的冰糖。如果哥布林在C5d区，这里的任何声音都会提醒他们。",
	"There's nothing else of interest in the room.": "房间里没有其他感兴趣的东西。",
	"Unless they were alerted previously, there are two {@creature kobold||kobolds}, Kribbitz and Zurff, in this room bickering over how to open a 6-foot-square, locked stone box they've unearthed from a cave-in on the northernmost wall. An {@condition unconscious} kobold, Nurzle, is lying on the floor with a needle in his neck. Kobolds are reptilian Humanoids who generally shy away from conflict unless cornered.": "除非他们之前被惊动了，否则在这个房间里有两个{@creature kobold||kobolds}，克里比兹和祖尔夫，正在为如何打开他们从最北边的墙壁上的洞穴中发掘出来的一个6英尺见方的带锁石盒而争吵。一个名叫努尔兹勒（Nurzle）的哥布林（1%）正躺在地板上，脖子上插着一根针。哥布林是爬行类人形动物，除非被逼到绝境，否则一般都会回避冲突。",
	"If Pink surprises the kobolds, they try to feel out Pink and see if they can get them to open the box. After which, the kobolds attempt to steal the gem and run.": "如果粉红让哥布林们感到惊讶，他们就会试图摸清粉红的底细，看看能否让他们打开盒子。之后，哥布林们试图偷取宝石并逃跑。",
	"If they were alerted earlier, the kobolds have hidden behind some old shelving under a canvas tarp with their {@condition unconscious} friend and are waiting to see if Pink can open the box.": "如果他们早些时候被惊动了，哥布林已经和他们的{@condition unconscious}朋友躲在一些旧架子的帆布篷下，等着看平克是否能打开盒子。",
	"If Pink manages to unlock the box, then the kobolds dash out and try to steal the gem. If Pink is ready for them, the kobolds try to intimidate, barter with, or beg Pink to hand it over. Mr. Greystone has been quite clear what will happen to the kobolds if they fail, and it isn't pleasant in the slightest.": "如果平克成功地打开了盒子，那么哥布林就会冲出来，试图偷走宝石。如果粉红准备好了，哥布林们就会试图恐吓、讨价还价，或者乞求粉红把宝石交出来。格雷斯通先生已经很清楚，如果哥布林们失败了，他们会有什么后果，而且丝毫不令人愉快。",
	"If Pink wants to make friends with the kobolds, Pink must promise that they'll protect the kobolds against the wrath of Mr. Greystone and then make a successful DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. If they do, the kobolds agree to leave Pink with the gem and not cause any more trouble.": "如果粉红想和哥布林交朋友，粉红必须保证他们会保护哥布林免受格雷斯通先生的愤怒，然后成功地进行DC14魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查。如果他们做到了，哥布林们就会同意把宝石留给平克，不再给他们带来任何麻烦。",
	"If Pink won't give it up without a fight, the kobolds fight 1 round of combat. As soon as one takes damage, they flee and yell all about what's going to happen to Pink when Mr. Greystone finds out.": "如果粉红不愿意不战而降，哥布林们就会打一回合的战斗。只要有一个人受到伤害，他们就会逃走，并大喊大叫，说当格雷斯通先生发现时，粉红会发生什么。",
	"The Coral Gem is a fist-sized gemstone worth 250 gp and it glows with a soft, pink light. It has no magic properties of its own.": "珊瑚宝石是一块拳头大小的宝石，价值250gp，它发出柔和的粉红色光芒。它本身没有魔法属性。",
	"This large cavern has more piles of rock candy rubble within it, but embedded in the eastern wall is the massive fossil of a 40-foot-long dragon.": "这个大洞穴内有更多的岩石糖果瓦砾堆，但在东面的墙壁上嵌有一条40英尺长的巨大龙的化石。",
	"If Pink carefully chips away at the rock for 20 minutes and makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, they can free a perfect dragon tooth from the stone. If the kobolds are still in area C5d, they're alerted by any attempts to chip free a fossil.": "如果平克小心翼翼地在岩石上凿了20分钟，并成功地进行了DC15灵巧检查，他们就可以从石头上解救出一颗完美的龙牙。如果哥布林还在C5d区，他们会被任何试图撬开化石的行为所惊动。",
	"The dragon tooth is worth 20 gp to an alchemist or collector. It would take about 6 months' work to free the entire skeleton which would sell for 1500 gp to a museum.": "这颗龙牙对炼金术士或收藏家来说价值20金币。要释放整个骨架需要6个月的时间，在博物馆里可以卖到1500戈比。",
	"{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} then bows and heads out the door. As he does, he flips the bartender a gold piece. Mauve does a double take then nods approvingly at Pink.": "{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}，然后鞠了一躬，向门外走去。当他这样做时，他给酒保扔了一块金币。莫夫看了两眼，然后赞许地朝粉红点点头。",
	"The following magic items appear in this adventure.": "下列魔法物品出现在这次冒险中。",
	"In solo play, there's always a chance the character can die. In the case of a single adventurer, this death results in the end of play; which isn't optimal for an afternoon of fun! One way to avoid death is to have healing readily available to the adventurer. If they're without healing, have the character find the odd {@item potion of healing} lying in a dusty crate or have them discover a special healing plant on their journey that, if eaten, puts them back to full hit points.": "在单人游戏中，角色总是有可能死亡。对于一个单独的冒险者，死亡会导致游戏结束；这对于一个下午的娱乐来说并不理想！避免死亡的一种方法是让冒险者随时获得治疗。如果他们没有治疗，可以让角色在一个灰尘箱子里找到一个奇怪的{@item potion of healing}，或者让他们在旅途中发现一种特殊的治疗植物，如果吃下去，就能让他们恢复满血。",
	"In the case of an untimely death, you can have a helpful NPC (like {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}) save the day and revive them, or you can have them forego death saving throws and wake up as they're being dragged someplace unpleasant.": "在发生意外死亡的情况下，你可以让一个有帮助的NPC（如{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}）挽救他们，让他们复活；或者让他们放弃死亡豁免检定，当他们被拖到一个不愉快的地方时醒来。",
	"Following {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}'s directions, Pink finds the dead-end alleyway. If Pink breaks through the fake wall, they see a dusty, stone staircase that descends 20 feet beneath the city, turning into a dark tunnel that leads east under Harmony. This tunnel is on average 10 feet wide and 10 feet tall and is roughly hewn from the dirt and rock. The tunnel eventually opens out into area C5a in Candy Mountain Mine (see below).": "按照{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}的指示，粉色发现了一条死胡同。如果粉色冲破假墙，他们会看到一条布满灰尘的石楼梯，向城市下方延伸20英尺，转向东边通往和谐之下的黑暗隧道。这条隧道平均宽10英尺，高10英尺，粗糙地从泥土和岩石中凿成。隧道最终通向糖果山矿区C5a区域（见下文）。",
	"From up ahead (or is it coming from behind you?), you hear a rasping voice that says, \"Ooooh. It smells like fresh meat has come down into the darky-dark just for {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC} to feast on.\"": "从前方传来（或者是从你身后传来？）一阵沙哑的声音说道：“哦呀。闻起来像是新鲜的肉下到了黑暗中，只为了供{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}享用。”",
	"Here, the ceiling has given away, resulting in a pile of loose boulders and treacherous footing that goes on for 50 feet. Treat the rubble as {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. Once Pink is halfway across, {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC} attacks from a hole in the ceiling. {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC} isn't affected by the {@quickref difficult terrain||3} and moves normally.": "这里，天花板坍塌了，导致一堆松散的巨石和危险的脚下，长达50英尺。将瓦砾视为{@quickref difficult terrain||3}。一旦粉红(Pink)走过一半，{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}从天花板的一个洞口袭击。{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}不受{@quickref difficult terrain||3}的影响，可以正常移动。",
	"Pink can use creative methods to get past the two {@creature guard||guards} at the gate. Here are a few ideas:": "粉红色可以使用创造性的方法来越过大门处的两个{@creature guard||guards}。以下是一些建议：",
	"Although it's old and neglected, the 20-foot-high stone wall surrounding the mine is still formidable. To scale the wall, Pink must succeed on two consecutive DC 10 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) checks. If the first check fails, Pink falls 10 feet and takes 3 ({@damage 1d6}) bludgeoning damage. If the second check fails, Pink falls 20 feet and takes 7 ({@damage 2d6}) bludgeoning damage.": "尽管这座矿山周围的20英尺高的石墙古旧且被忽视，但仍然令人生畏。为了攀爬这堵墙，粉红必须连续成功进行两次DC 10力量检定({@skill Athletics})。如果第一次检定失败，粉红会摔落10英尺并受到3({@damage 1d6}) 钝击伤害。如果第二次检定失败，粉红会摔落20英尺并受到7({@damage 2d6}) 钝击伤害。",
	"The staircase descends 40 feet and ends at a wooden door. A successful DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check reveals the footprints belong to a kobold.": "楼梯下降40英尺，最后到达一扇木门。成功的智力检定 DC 14 ({@skill Nature}) 检查显示这些脚印属于一个龙裔((kobold))。",
	"If the player chose Path 2 and didn't take Path 1, let them go about 100 feet into the tunnel before reminding them that this could be the second entrance to the mine that leads back to Harmony. If they ignore that and continue, then have them encounter {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC} and the traps before emerging near the marketplace.": "如果玩家选择了路径2，并没有选择路径1，在让他们在隧道里走大约100英尺后，提醒他们这可能是通往和谐镇的第二个矿井入口。如果他们忽略了这一点并继续前进，那么让他们遭遇{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}和陷阱，然后出现在市场附近。",
	"The shaft leading to this area has a trip wire strung across the floor at ankle height. A successful DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check is needed to find it. If the trip wire is triggered, a net filled with old cans falls on the intruders. Pink must make a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or get tangled in the net and be {@condition restrained}. Pink must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. On a success, Pink escapes from the trap.": "通往这个区域的通道上有一根绊线横穿在脚踝高度的地面上。需要成功通过DC 14的感知检定才能发现它。如果绊线被触发，一个装满旧罐头的网会落在闯入者身上。Pink必须成功通过DC 14的敏捷豁免才能避免被网困住并被{@condition restrained}。Pink必须在每个回合结束时重复这个豁免检定。若成功，Pink就能逃离陷阱。",
	"The racket alerts the two {@creature kobold||kobolds} in area C5d, who arrive 1 round after the trap triggers.": "球拍警报了C5d区域中的两个{@creature kobold||kobolds}，他们在陷阱触发后1回合后到达。",
	"The stone box weighs 3,000 lb. and is made of quartzite—a very hard type of stone. The box is covered with runes and glyphs. It has a keyhole and six buttons. The lock is trapped and requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check to open. On a failure, a poison needle shoots out. Whoever is picking the lock must roll a {@dice d6}. On a 2–6, they're hit by the needle and fall asleep for 8 hours. On a 1, the needle misses. Either way the box remains closed.": "这个石盒重达3,000磅，由石英岩制成——一种非常坚硬的石头。盒子上覆盖着符文和象形文字。它有一个钥匙孔和六个按钮。锁上设有陷阱，需要成功进行一次DC 15的敏捷检定({@skill Sleight of Hand})才能打开。如果失败，将会有毒针射出。试图撬锁的人必须投掷一个{@dice d6}。在掷出2-6的情况下，他们会被针刺中，然后昏睡8小时。掷出1的情况下，针会错过。无论如何，盒子都会保持关闭状态。",
	"If Pink makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check, they know this is the fossil of a blue dragon. Pink knows that as well as being ferocious hunters that breathe lightning to stun or kill their prey, blue dragons are among the most intelligent of the dragons.": "如果粉色角色成功进行一次 DC 12 智力检定（{@skill Nature}），他们会知道这是一只蓝龙的化石。粉色角色也知道，蓝龙是凶猛的猎手，可以喷射闪电来击晕或杀死猎物，而且它们是龙类中最聪明的之一。",
	"When Pink returns to Harmony, they're met by {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} at the inn where Pink is staying. If Pink hands over the Coral Gem, {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} breathes a sigh of relief and then shakes Pink's hand with vigor while thanking them profusely. {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} invites Red to join the Lorekeeper Society. If Red accepts, {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} then reaches into his satchel and gives Pink a pair of gloves of thievery (see below) with the hopes that Pink will put them to good use in the days to come. \"The battle isn't over yet,\" {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} exclaims to Pink. \"There's still more work to be done before the color can come back to Harmony. The Lorekeeper Society will be in touch.\"": "当粉色回到和谐镇时，在粉色住的客栈里，他们遇到了{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}。如果粉色交出了珊瑚宝石，{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}松了口气，然后热情地握住粉色的手，感谢他们。{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}邀请红色加入博学者协会。如果红色接受，{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}便伸手进他的背包，给了粉色一双盗贼手套(见下文)，希望粉色能在未来的日子里好好利用它们。“战斗还没有结束，”{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}对粉色说道。“在和谐镇恢复色彩之前，还有更多工作要做。博学者协会会与你联系的。”"
