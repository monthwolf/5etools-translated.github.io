Tristan asks the characters to get rid of this menace.": "角色们被崔斯坦爵士召唤，他是位于一片孤独的山脉中的小领地的统治者。一头可怕的怪物，叫作thessalhydra，一直在攻击他的领地。它是一种奇怪而可怕的生物，有八个头，围绕着一张大圆嘴，边缘有锯齿。它的嘴里滴着酸液，它的尾巴末端是一对锋利的钳子。崔斯坦要求这些人物摆脱这种威胁。",
	"The thessalhydra was last seen going into caverns belonging to an unfriendly tribe of troglodytes. The characters must enter the caverns and deal with the stinky trogs.

He will help them escape only if they prove themselves worthy by solving his riddles.": "人们最后一次看到海蛇进入属于一个不友好的troglodytes部落的洞穴。角色们必须进入岩洞，对付那些臭气熏天的trogs。循着海蛇的足迹，他们进入了一个被诅咒的迷宫，在那里他们遇到了失落的骑士。只有当他们通过解开他的谜语来证明自己的价值时，他才会帮助他们逃脱。",
	"The way to escape from the labyrinth is through a portal into a strange, dark, parallel dimension called the Upside Down.

They treat the characters well—they're the heroes Sir Tristan turns to in his time of need. Give them confidence to take bold action (sometimes Will needs to be reminded that he's playing a character, not just himself).": "这个场景都是关于对话的。人物直接与崔斯坦爵士交谈，但这里也有其他人--皇家顾问、与怪物作战的卫兵，等等。他们善待这些人物--他们是崔斯坦爵士在需要时求助的英雄。给他们信心，让他们采取大胆的行动（有时需要提醒威尔，他在扮演一个角色，而不仅仅是他自己）。",

	"Once the deal is struck, Sir Tristan might have a surprise for the group. If the characters negotiated a fair deal and respected their friendship with Sir Tristan, he will give them some magic equipment that will be useful in this adventure. If they were greedy or acted like they didn't care about their friendship with Sir Tristan, he won't give them anything extra.": "一旦达成交易，崔斯坦爵士可能会给大家一个惊喜。如果角色们谈判达成了公平的交易，并且尊重他们与崔斯坦爵士的友谊，他就会给他们一些在这次冒险中有用的魔法装备。如果他们很贪婪或者表现得不在乎他们与崔斯坦爵士的友谊，他就不会给他们任何额外的东西。",

A key component of this ritual is blood from a monstrosity (a type of creature). The thessalhydra is a monstrosity, so it can use its own blood to open a gateway.": "蛇头人利用颠倒空间作为返回其巢穴而不被追踪的方法。巢穴是一个山洞，物质世界和颠倒世界在这里接触。那里生长着一种特殊的植物--一种在两个世界都能开花的植物。如果你完成一个特定的仪式，这些花就可以用来穿越世界。这个仪式的一个关键组成部分是来自怪兽（一种生物）的血液。水螅是一种怪兽，所以它可以用自己的血来打开一个通道。",
	"If the characters don't want to spill their own blood, they can stalk the demogorgon, but this is very difficult. One character should try a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check for the group.

	"A demogorgon is a monstrosity the size and shape of an adult human, but its mouth fills its face and opens like a blooming flower. One currently lives in the Upside Down, and no one knows where it came from originally. It's incredibly strong and can heal itself from damage it takes (even here in the Upside Down).

	"If the characters kill the thessalhydra, they have successfully completed this adventure. When they chop off the creature's heads and bring them back to Sir Tristan, he will welcome them as conquering heroes, shower them with treasure, and grant each one a boon (as long as it is within his power to do so).
