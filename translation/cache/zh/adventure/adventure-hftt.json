Tristan asks the characters to get rid of this menace.": "角色们被崔斯坦爵士召唤，他是位于一片孤独的山脉中的小领地的统治者。一头可怕的怪物，叫作thessalhydra，一直在攻击他的领地。它是一种奇怪而可怕的生物，有八个头，围绕着一张大圆嘴，边缘有锯齿。它的嘴里滴着酸液，它的尾巴末端是一对锋利的钳子。崔斯坦要求这些人物摆脱这种威胁。",

	"Nearby is a hidden passage (marked as an \"S\" on the map). It takes a successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to notice it. Once found, it can be used freely.": "附近有一个隐藏的通道（在地图上标为 \"S\"）。需要通过DC12智慧({@skill Perception})检查才能发现它。一旦发现，就可以自由使用。",
	"This is where the troglodytes go to leave offerings in worship of the thessalhydra. The walls are covered with small niches, each of which contains an offering. (See \"Conclusion\" below.)": "这里是troglodytes去留下祭品以崇拜thessalhydra的地方。墙壁上布满了小壁龛，每个壁龛都有一个祭品。(见下文 \"结论\"）。",
	"If the characters kill the thessalhydra, they have successfully completed this adventure. When they chop off the creature's heads and bring them back to Sir Tristan, he will welcome them as conquering heroes, shower them with treasure, and grant each one a boon (as long as it is within his power to do so). Additionally, in area 6 of the thessalhydra's lair they will find coins, gems, and artwork worth 1,000 gold pieces, plus one magic item of your (the Dungeon Master's) choice.": "如果角色们杀死了西斯尔海德拉，他们就成功完成了这次冒险。当他们砍下怪物的头颅并将其带回给崔斯坦爵士时，他将以征服者的身份欢迎他们，用财宝沐浴他们，并给予每个人一个恩惠（只要他有能力这样做）。此外，在深海巨兽巢穴的第6区，他们将找到价值1000金币的硬币、宝石和艺术品，以及你（地下城管理员）选择的一件魔法物品。",
	"Perhaps the best reward of all is that the characters each gain a level. Use the information in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} to make them 4th level. They will then be ready to seek more adventure and rewards in future games of Dungeons & Dragons!": "也许最好的奖励是，人物各自获得一个等级。使用{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的信息，使他们达到第四级。然后，他们将准备好在未来的龙与地下城游戏中寻求更多的冒险和奖励!",
	"If the characters don't want to spill their own blood, they can stalk the demogorgon, but this is very difficult. One character should try a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check for the group. If this is successful, they have found the demogorgon. If it fails, the group may try again (with the same character or a different one making the check). If the group fails three times, the demogorgon has found them and attacks, but the characters are {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised} (see chapter 2 of the rulebook for how surprise works).": "如果角色们不想洒自己的血，他们可以跟踪魔形怪，但这是非常困难的。一个角色应该为这群人做一个DC15智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查。如果成功的话，他们就找到了魔形怪。如果失败了，小组可以再试一次（由同一个角色或不同的角色进行检查）。如果他们三次都失败了，那么妖怪就发现了他们并发动了攻击，但这些角色是{@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised}（关于惊喜的作用，请参见规则手册的第二章）。",
	"When the players start getting bored with roleplaying encounters, it's time for them to find the {@creature troglodyte} caves. If they've wandered off following false leads, just have them luckily stumble upon the right cave.": "当玩家开始对角色扮演遭遇感到厌倦时，是时候让他们找到{@creature troglodyte}洞穴了。如果他们迷失在错误的线索中，就让他们幸运地偶然发现正确的洞穴。",
	"If the skill check fails, they still arrive at the caves, but unluckily do so at the same time as a returning hunting party of 8 {@creature Troglodyte||troglodytes}. They must defeat the hunting party before they can enter the caves.": "如果技能检定失败，他们仍然会抵达洞穴，但不幸的是与一个由8名猎人组成的返回队伍同时抵达{@creature Troglodyte||troglodytes}。他们必须在进入洞穴之前击败这支猎人队伍。",
	"The cave is empty, but the hall to area 4 is trapped, which requires a successful DC 10 ability check to detect, using Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}), or disarm, using Dexterity. If triggered, the roof collapses. Anyone in the hall must make a DC 10 Dexterity save. Those who fail take {@dice 2d6 + 2} bludgeoning damage. Those who succeed take half as much damage. The hall becomes impassable.": "洞穴是空的，但通往区域4的大厅被设置了陷阱，需要进行一次成功的DC 10能力检定来发现，使用智力（{@skill Investigation}），或者使用敏捷来解除。如果触发，屋顶会坍塌。大厅内的任何人必须进行一次DC 10的敏捷豁免检定。那些失败的人会受到{@dice 2d6 + 2}的钝击伤害。那些成功的人会受到一半伤害。大厅变得无法通过。",
	"This is where the troglodytes keep their few valuable items. There are 200 gp in coins and gems, plus artwork and other valuables worth 200 gp more. The secret door that connects to area 6 needs a successful DC 15 ability check to detect, using Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}), or open, using Dexterity.": "这是穴居人保存他们少量贵重物品的地方。有200 gp 的硬币和宝石，加上价值更多200 gp 的艺术品和其他贵重物品。连接到区域6的秘密门需要通过一个成功的 DC 15 能力检定来发现，使用智力 ({@skill Investigation})，或者打开，使用敏捷。",

	"This is where the five {@creature troglodyte} leaders sleep. The head trog is a fair and noble ruler (like a trog version of Sir Tristan). He'd rather talk than fight (unlike most trogs, he speaks Common). But if the group angers him, all the trogs attack and fight to the death. If the group politely asks about the thessalhydra, he'll say that it comes in from the woods, passes through the caves, and enters the Cursed Labyrinth. It never travels the opposite way.": "这就是五位{@creature troglodyte}领袖休息的地方。头号洞穴怪是一位公正而高贵的统治者（就像是特里斯坦爵士的洞穴怪版本）。他更愿意交谈而不是战斗（与大多数洞穴怪不同，他会说通用语）。但如果团队惹怒了他，所有洞穴怪都会发起攻击，并战斗到死。如果团队礼貌地询问关于多头蛇，他会说它是从树林中进入，穿过洞穴，然后进入被诅咒的迷宫。它从不沿着相反的路线行进。",
	"One {@creature owlbear} is here and sleeping. Characters may attempt Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks against its passive Perception (13). Failure means it wakes up and attacks.": "有一个{@creature owlbear}在这里睡觉。角色可以尝试根据它的被动感知（13）进行敏捷检定({@skill Stealth})。失败意味着它会醒来并发动攻击。",
	"They find the remains of an ancient adventurer who died trying to escape the labyrinth. The body has treasure worth {@dice 3d20} gold pieces.": "他们发现了一位古代冒险家的遗骸，他在试图逃离迷宫时死去。这具尸体上有价值{@dice 3d20}金币的宝藏。",

	"The {@b first riddle} is simple. All they have to do is catch him. He runs around the corner and calls back:": "这个{@b first riddle}很简单。他们只需要抓住他。他跑过拐角，然后回头喊道：",
	"The sword that the characters might have received from Sir Tristan, {@item Winter's Dark Bite|HftT}, is made of metal mined from the Upside Down, so it gets even stronger when it's used here. While in the Upside Down, Winter's Dark Bite acts like a +4 greatsword.": "角色们可能从特里斯坦爵士{@item Winter's Dark Bite|HftT}那里收到的剑是用从倒置世界挖掘出的金属制成的，因此在这里使用时会变得更加强大。在倒置世界中，冬季黑暗之咬的作用就像一把+4的大剑。",
	"The Proud Princess can point them to the cavern where the flowers grow, but if the characters want to open a gateway, they'll also need the blood of a monstrosity. Luckily, she knows of one that has been stalking around the Upside Down lately: a {@creature demogorgon|HftT}!": "骄傲的公主可以指引他们找到鲜花生长的洞穴，但如果角色们想要打开一个通道，他们还需要一个怪物的血液。幸运的是，她知道最近在颠倒世界里四处游荡的一个: 一个{@creature demogorgon|HftT}!",
	"She tells them that the demogorgon is attracted to the smell of blood. The easiest way to get its attention is to spill blood on the ground. But since there are so few creatures in the Upside Down, the only source is the characters themselves. Using a weapon carefully, a character can do minor damage (cutting their palm) causing 1 hp of damage and spilling a small amount of blood. If the group spills a total of 3 hp worth of blood, the demogorgon will arrive {@dice 1d6} minutes later, leaping from the darkness and attacking the group.": "她告诉他们，恶魔之王被血腥气味所吸引。吸引它注意的最简单方法是在地面上洒上鲜血。但由于倒置世界中生物稀少，唯一的来源就是这些角色自己。使用武器小心翼翼地，一个角色可以造成轻微伤害（划破他们的手掌），造成1点生命值的伤害并洒出少量鲜血。如果小组总共洒出了价值3点生命值的血液，恶魔之王将在{@dice 1d6}分钟后出现，从黑暗中跃出并袭击小组。",
	"The Proud Princess says that they need a few ounces of blood from the creature to open a gateway (filling an empty potion vial will do nicely, but let the characters solve the problem). If the {@creature demogorgon|HftT} is killed, they can get the blood easily. But let them try other ways if they don't want to fight to the death. For example, they can get blood off a sword blade immediately after it strikes and damages the creature (they must do this four times to get enough blood).": "骄傲的公主说他们需要从生物身上取几盎司的血来打开一个传送门（将一个空的药瓶装满就可以了，但让角色们自己解决这个问题）。如果{@creature demogorgon|HftT}被杀死，他们可以轻松地得到血液。但如果他们不想打到生物死亡，让他们尝试其他方法。例如，他们可以在剑刃击中并伤害生物后立即取得血液（他们必须这样做四次才能得到足够的血液）。",
	"After the characters have gotten enough demogorgon blood, they can take it to the cavern with the flowers. If they pour the blood on one of the flowers, it bursts open violently (anyone standing next to the flower must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity save or be knocked {@condition prone}), creating a cross-planar gate. Stepping through leads to area 1 of the lair of the thessalhydra.": "在角色们获得足够的德莫戈尔冈血液后，他们可以将其带到带有鲜花的洞穴。如果他们将血液倒在其中一朵花上，花朵会猛烈地爆开（站在花旁边的任何人必须成功通过 DC 12 的敏捷豁免，否则被击倒{@condition prone}），形成一个跨平面之门。穿过门会通往螳螂蛇兽巢穴的区域1。",
	"There's a 20-foot-wide pit. It takes a successful DC 12 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to jump across. Failing a jump without a safety rope tied to you means you fall away into darkness and take {@dice 3d10} bludgeoning damage. The pit is 30 feet deep.": "这里有一个宽20英尺的坑。成功跳过需要进行一次DC 12的力量检定({@skill Athletics})。如果跳跃失败且没有安全绳绑在身上，意味着你会坠入黑暗中，受到{@dice 3d10}的钝击伤害。这个坑有30英尺深。",
	"A tribe of ten {@creature Troglodyte||troglodytes} live here. When the thessalhydra moved in, the trogs began to worship it as a god. Now they protect it while it sleeps.
