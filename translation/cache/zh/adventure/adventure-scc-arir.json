	"As the fourth and final year of the characters' academic career at Strixhaven dawns, the university faces a crisis. In this adventure, the characters come face-to-face with an awful truth: not only does {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} Grenshel threaten the safety of everyone on campus, but the university's masters are powerless against the villain.

A former student who was expelled 200 years ago, he has artificially extended his life and seeks true immortality. He corrupted eldritch balm to cause magical mishaps, schemed to attack students at a Mage Tower game, and manipulated one of Lorehold's deans to harm students. Now his schemes threaten the entire campus.": "如果你把这一章的冒险作为一个独立的项目，你可以总结一下{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}在过去三年里所展开的计划，以确立他是人物必须面对的威胁。他是200年前被开除的学生，人为地延长了自己的生命，并寻求真正的永生。他腐蚀了长生不老药膏以造成魔法事故，在法师塔游戏中阴谋袭击学生，并操纵罗尔霍德的一位院长来伤害学生。现在他的计划威胁着整个校园。",
