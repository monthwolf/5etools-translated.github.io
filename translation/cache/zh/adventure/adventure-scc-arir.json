A former student who was expelled 200 years ago, he has artificially extended his life and seeks true immortality. He corrupted eldritch balm to cause magical mishaps, schemed to attack students at a Mage Tower game, and manipulated one of Lorehold's deans to harm students.

	"Once the characters are ready to embark on their mission to stop {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} once and for all, they can head through the badlands again and into the Ruins of Caerdoon.": "一旦角色们准备好开始他们的任务，彻底阻止{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}，他们可以再次穿过荒地，进入卡尔顿废墟。",
	"Nothing can physically pass through the dome unless certain conditions are met, as explained below. However, the dome doesn't block ethereal creatures or prevent the use of spells such as {@spell dimension door} or {@spell teleport}.": "除非满足特定条件，否则任何物体都无法穿过这个圆顶，具体条件如下所述。然而，这个圆顶不会阻挡虚影生物，也不会阻止使用像{@spell dimension door}或{@spell teleport}这样的法术。",
	"The dome is impervious to most damage. However, a character who examines the dome and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check ascertains that it's possible to make a temporary hole in the dome by dealing radiant damage to it, and that a skilled arcanist can manipulate the dome's magical harmonics to make it susceptible to other damage types, as well (as described below).": "这个圆顶几乎无法受到任何伤害。然而，一个角色检查这个圆顶并且在一次DC 15的智力检定中成功（{@skill Arcana}）可以确定，通过对其造成辐射伤害，可以在圆顶上制造一个临时的孔洞，并且一个熟练的秘术师可以操纵圆顶的魔法和谐来使其容易受到其他类型的伤害，如下所述。",
	"A character who searches the area and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check finds a catapult munition roughly the size and weight of a cannonball amid the wreckage. A successful DC 13 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check reveals that the munition is powerful enough to damage the Shield of the Fallen in area N2, provided the dome's magical harmonics are altered so that the dome becomes susceptible to fire damage.": "一个角色在搜索区域并成功通过一次DC 15的感知检定({@skill Perception})后，在残骸中发现了一个大致与炮弹相同大小和重量的投石器弹药。一次成功的DC 13的智力检定({@skill Arcana})揭示了这个弹药足够强大，可以对N2区域的陨落之盾造成伤害，前提是改变圆顶的魔法谐波，使其对火焰伤害产生脆弱性。",
	"The area covered by wreckage is {@book difficult terrain|PHB|8|Difficult Terrain}.": "残骸覆盖的区域为{@book difficult terrain|PHB|8|Difficult Terrain}。",
	"Six {@creature Wight||wights} crawl out of the wreckage if the characters move or rummage through it. When the wights appear, read:": "如果角色移动或在废墟中搜寻，将会有六个{@creature Wight||wights}爬出来。当战鬼出现时，阅读：",
	"The wights take their orders from the wraith in {@adventure area N1|SCC-ARiR|0|N1. Haunted Watchtower}, and the wraith has instructed the wights to attack trespassers on sight. However, a character who calls for a cessation of hostilities can, with a successful DC 13 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, convince the wights not to attack on their next turn and answer a few questions instead. This ploy works once, after which further calls for peace fall on deaf ears. Questions the wights can answer include the following:": "幽灵们听从{@adventure area N1|SCC-ARiR|0|N1. Haunted Watchtower}中的幽灵的命令，幽灵指示幽灵在看到闯入者时发动攻击。然而，一个角色若要求停止敌对行动，可以通过一次成功的DC 13魅力检定({@skill Persuasion})，说服幽灵在他们的下一个回合不发动攻击，而是回答几个问题。这个计谋只能使用一次，之后再呼吁和平将毫无效果。幽灵可以回答的问题包括以下内容：",
	"In each 5-foot square marked X on {@adventure map 6.4|SCC-ARiR|0|Map 6.4: ruins of caerdoon} is a {@spell glyph of warding} placed by {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}. Finding each glyph requires a successful DC 16 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check. If the wights in area N5 warned the characters about the glyphs, checks made to find them have advantage.": "在每个标有X的5英尺正方形格子上，都有一个由{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}放置的{@spell glyph of warding}。要找到每个符文，需要进行一次成功的DC 16智力检定({@skill Investigation})。如果N5区域的幽灵警告了角色有关这些符文，那么寻找它们的检定获得优势。",
	"A character who examines the sphere and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check ascertains that it powers the dome around the ruins (see {@adventure area N2|SCC-ARiR|0|N2. Wailing Moat}), and that its haphazard construction makes it susceptible to having its innards torn out or its magic destabilized.": "一个角色检查这个球体并在一次DC 15智力检定中成功，可以确定它给废墟周围的圆顶（见{@adventure area N2|SCC-ARiR|0|N2. Wailing Moat}）提供能量，并且它杂乱的结构使得它容易被拆解或者魔法被破坏。",
	"A character can reach inside the Locus through one of its mouths and try to rip out its innards with a DC 15 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. If the check fails, the character is unsuccessful and takes 10 necrotic damage. If the check succeeds, the character takes 5 necrotic damage and deals 22 ({@dice 4d10}) slashing damage to the Locus, ignoring its damage threshold and resistance to slashing damage.": "一个角色可以通过Locus的一个口进入其中，并尝试用DC 15 力量检定({@skill Athletics})来撕裂其内脏。如果检定失败，角色将无功而返并受到10点死灵伤害。如果检定成功，角色将受到5点死灵伤害，并对Locus造成22({@dice 4d10})斩击伤害，无视其伤害阈值和对斩击伤害的抗性。",
	"A character within 5 feet of the Locus can use an action to try to overload it using an incantation taught in school. The character concludes the incantation by making an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. If the check fails, the character takes 5 necrotic damage. If the check succeeds, the Locus takes 22 ({@dice 4d10}) force damage, ignoring its damage threshold.": "一个距离聚焦点5英尺内的角色可以使用一个动作，尝试使用学校教授的咒语来过载它。角色通过进行一个智力检定（{@skill Arcana}）来完成咒语。如果检定失败，角色会受到5点死灵伤害。如果检定成功，聚焦点会受到22点力场伤害，无视其伤害阈值。",
	"The doors are constructed of heavy wood. Each sports a simple but sturdy drop-down latch on the outside unless otherwise specified. Latched doors require a successful DC 16 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to batter open from the inside.": "这些门由厚重的木头构成。除非另有规定，每扇门外都有一个简单但坚固的下拉式门闩。从内部打开已锁上的门需要进行一次成功的 DC 16 力量检定({@skill Athletics})。",
	"A character who spends 1 minute searching the crates can, with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Nature}) check, find one of the following useful concoctions. Only one of each concoction can be found here:": "一个角色花费1分钟搜索这些板条箱，如果成功进行一次DC 15的智力检定({@skill Arcana}或{@skill Nature})，就可以找到以下其中一种有用的混合物。这里只能找到每种混合物中的一种：",
	"Grain and other dry goods used to be stored here, but {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} has consumed them, leaving the room bare except for some empty sacks.": "谷物和其他干货曾经存放在这里，但{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}已经把它们吞噬一空，只剩下一些空袋子。",

	"Once the barrier is destroyed, characters can attack {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} and the five ritual stones circling him. Each stone is an 8-inch-long cylindrical opal covered with delicate golden runes. It has AC 18, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} to 0 hit points or destroying all five ritual stones ends the ritual before it can be completed (see \"{@adventure Stopping the Ritual|SCC-ARiR|0|Stopping the Ritual}\" below).": "一旦障碍被摧毁，角色可以攻击{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}和环绕着他的五块仪式石。每块石头都是一块长8英寸的圆柱形蛋白石，上面覆盖着精致的金色符文。它的护甲等级为18，有30点生命值，并且免疫毒素和精神伤害。将{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}的生命值降为0或摧毁所有五块仪式石会在仪式完成之前结束仪式（见“{@adventure Stopping the Ritual|SCC-ARiR|0|Stopping the Ritual}”）。",
	"On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} can take one of the following lair actions; after he does so, he can't use that action again until he finishes a long rest:": "在20号先攻计数（先攻相同时，{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}），{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}可以选择以下其中一项巢穴行动；在使用完一项行动后，直到完成一次长休之前，不能再次使用该行动：",
	"A {@creature clay golem} erupts from the floor in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of the ritual circle. The golem obeys {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}'s commands, takes its turns on initiative count 10 (losing initiative ties), fights until destroyed, and reverts to a mound of inanimate clay after 1 hour.": "一个 {@creature clay golem} 从仪式圈内15英尺范围内的空地中喷发而出。这个傀儡听从 {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} 的命令，在10号（失去先攻平局）的先攻顺序上行动，战斗直到被摧毁，在1小时后变回一堆无生命的黏土。",
	"A Medium fist made of packed earth rises from the floor in an unoccupied space that {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} can see within 30 feet of him. The fist then attacks one creature of his choice that is within 5 feet of the fist. The fist has a +11 bonus to hit, and on a hit, the target takes 13 ({@dice 3d8}) bludgeoning damage and is {@condition grappled} (escape DC 15). The fist disappears if the attack roll misses or if the grapple ends. When the fist disappears, this lair action recharges, allowing {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} to use it again.": "一个由紧实土地制成的中型拳头从地板上升起，出现在{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}在30英尺内能看到的一个空地方。然后这只拳头攻击距离它5英尺内的{@dice 3d8}选择的一个生物。拳头有+11的命中加值，命中时，目标受到13点({@dice 3d8})的殴打伤害，并被{@condition grappled} (逃脱 DC 15)。如果攻击失手或者抓取结束，拳头就会消失。当拳头消失时，这个巢穴动作会重新充能，允许{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}再次使用它。",
	"Tendrils of necrotic energy erupt from the ritual circle and lash out at any number of creatures {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} can see within 15 feet of the circle.

	"{@creature Murgaxor|SCC} summons four {@creature Mud Mephit||mud mephits} that appear in unoccupied spaces within 15 feet of the ritual circle.

	"A warbling, high-pitched wail escapes {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} as he crashes to the floor with a wet thump. A rush of air and a concussive blast momentarily replaces all sound. The thrum of magical power is gone.": "当他重重摔倒在地板上发出湿响时，一个颤抖、尖锐的哀鸣声从{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}中传出。一股气流和冲击波瞬间取代了所有声音。那股魔法力量的嗡鸣消失了。",
	"The pitiful, muddy figure on the floor is {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} (use the {@creature bullywug} stat block). When the ritual was disrupted, his powers dissipated as well. In this state, he no longer poses a threat to anyone. The characters have won!": "地板上可怜、泥泞的身影是{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}（使用{@creature bullywug}属性块）。当仪式被打断时，他的力量也消散了。在这种状态下，他不再对任何人构成威胁。角色们获胜了！",
	"If all the characters fall {@condition unconscious} or die in the final encounter, they fail to stop {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}'s ritual. Shortly afterward, the ritual deals 70 ({@dice 20d6}) necrotic damage to everyone on campus as {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} siphons their life force. Hundreds of scholars die, and many more are severely injured. {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} becomes immortal and one of the most powerful spellcasters in the world. If the characters survive, perhaps the Founder Dragons and the archaics can guide them as they attempt to stop {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} in a dystopian new world.": "如果所有角色在最后一场遭遇中倒下{@condition unconscious}或死亡，他们将无法阻止{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}的仪式。仪式完成后不久，{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}吸取他们的生命力，对校园内的每个人造成70({@dice 20d6})点死灵伤害。数百名学者死亡，更多人受重伤。{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}成为不朽者，成为世界上最强大的法师之一。如果角色幸存下来，也许创始巨龙和古老者可以指引他们，帮助他们试图在一个充满压抑的新世界中阻止{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}。",
