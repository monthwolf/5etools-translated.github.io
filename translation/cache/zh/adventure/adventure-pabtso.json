	"Klarg received a messenger goblin from King Grol a few days ago. The messenger told him that someone named \"the Spider\" was paying the Cragmaws to capture {@creature Gundren Rockseeker|PaBTSO} and send him and anything he was carrying to King Grol.

	"Recently, strange goblins have sometimes joined the Cragmaws in their roadside ambushes, though not today. These strange goblins have elongated skulls, and glowing green energy surrounds their weapons when they attack. The Cragmaw goblins don't know who these newcomers are; the new goblins simply cackle and leave after each attack. The Cragmaws are afraid of these strange goblins and think the characters should be, too. (This is a reference to the psionic goblins that factor more prominently in later chapters.)": "最近，奇怪的地精有时会加入克拉格莫部落在路边设伏的行动中，尽管今天没有。这些奇怪的地精头骨很长，当它们攻击时，武器周围会笼罩着发光的绿色能量。克拉格莫地精不知道这些新来者是谁；新地精只是咯咯地笑着，在每次袭击后离开。克拉格莫部落害怕这些奇怪的地精，认为角色们也应该害怕。（这是对稍后章节中更为突出的念力地精的提及。）",

The shop was in the southeast part of Thundertree. (If the characters decide to explore the ruins of Thundertree, see {@area chapter 3|0de|x}.)": "尽管她目前没有什么立即可以作为奖励提供，米尔娜告诉角色她可能知道一个有价值的传家宝藏的地方。当她还是个年轻女孩时，她和家人在不死生物占领了这个地方后逃离了雷树镇。她的家人在雷树镇的东南部有一家草药和炼金店，店内有一个藏在储物架下的盒子里的翡翠项链。她从未 dared 返回去取回它。这家店位于雷树镇的东南部。（如果角色决定探索雷树镇的废墟，请参见{@area chapter 3|0de|x}。）",

	"The characters likely arrive here by one of three routes: the tunnel from {@area area R1|093|x}; the storeroom at {@area area R7|0ab|x}; or the rough-hewn passage to the south, which continues off the map for about one hundred feet and emerges from a cave in the woods south of Tresendar Manor. The southern passage is an excellent way to smuggle people or goods in and out of Phandalin. If the characters spoke to Carp Alderleaf (see the \"{@area Alderleaf Farm|079|x}\" section), he will lead them to the tunnel entrance but won't follow them inside.": "这些角色可能通过三条路线中的一条到达这里：从{@area area R1|093|x}的隧道；从{@area area R7|0ab|x}的储藏室；或者向南的粗糙通道，它在地图之外延伸约一百英尺，从Tresendar庄园南部的树林中的一个洞穴中出来。南部通道是一个极好的走私人员或货物进出Phandalin的方式。如果角色与Carp Alderleaf（见“{@area Alderleaf Farm|079|x}”部分）交谈过，他会带他们去隧道入口，但不会跟随他们进去。",

Lured by a faint magical effect emanating from the crevasse, the creature was occupying the area when Glasstaff moved in.

Ssarnak is untrustworthy but loyal enough, for the moment.": "一个地下怪物，它渴望肉食——一个名叫萨纳克（Ssarnak）的{@creature nothic}，守护着这个洞穴。被裂缝中发出的微弱魔法效果吸引，当格拉斯塔夫搬进这里时，这个生物已经占据了这个区域。格拉斯塔夫与这个怪物达成了协议，说服它帮助守卫这个据点，作为交换，提供宝藏和偶尔的新鲜肉食。萨纳克不可信任，但目前足够忠诚。",

If it notices intruders entering the cave, it hides behind one of the large stone columns and watches them, attempting to use its Weird Insight to discern the intruders' secrets.": "Ssarnak通常潜伏在两座桥的西端附近。如果它注意到入侵者进入洞穴，它会藏在其中一根大石柱后面观察他们，试图使用其奇异洞察力来揭示入侵者的秘密。",
	"Ssarnak communicates via telepathy. If detected, it prefers to negotiate and will betray the Redbrands for the right incentive, such as the promise of food.

A character next to the bridge can spot the rigged construction with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. Any creature, including Ssarnak, can dislodge one end of either bridge, dropping it into the crevasse, as an action. A creature that falls into the crevasse takes 7 ({@dice 2d6}) bludgeoning damage, has the {@condition prone} condition, and lands in a jumble of rubble that counts as {@book difficult terrain|PHB|8|Difficult Terrain}.": "这些桥是由木板制成的，没有栏杆。南边的桥被设置成当重量超过50磅的生物通过时会坍塌。站在桥旁的角色可以通过成功的DC 10感知({@skill Perception})检定发现被设置的构造。任何生物，包括Ssarnak，在行动中可以撬动任一桥的一端，使其掉入裂缝中。掉入裂缝的生物会受到7({@dice 2d6})的钝击伤害，获得{@condition prone}状态，并着陆在一堆碎石中，算作{@book difficult terrain|PHB|8|Difficult Terrain}。",

The magic causes all organic matter in the crevasse to age and decompose at half the normal rate.": "裂缝底部感觉异常寒冷。当用{@spell detect magic}法术查看时，这个区域散发出微弱的死灵气息。这种魔法导致裂缝中的所有有机物以正常速度的一半老化和分解。",
	"Heaped at the bottom is the skeleton of Thel Dendrar, the woodcarver of Phandalin who was murdered by the Redbrands.

In the wake of the natural disaster, a plague of strange zombies swept over the area, killing or driving off those who survived the eruption.": "在从无冬森林涌出的无冬河附近，矗立着废弃的雷树村(Thundertree)。曾经，这里是一个繁荣的社区，靠着伐木工和捕兽者的劳作致富。三十年前，北部火焰山(Mount Hotenow)的喷发摧毁了雷树村。在这场自然灾害的余波中，一群奇怪的僵尸肆虐该地区，杀死或驱赶了幸存于喷发的人们。",
	"Though most of the zombies have long since crumbled to dust, strange magic permeating the area has mutated the local vegetation into new and dangerous forms. Few people dare to venture into the ruined village now, and those who do so seldom stay long—with two notable exceptions. The druid Reidoth (see {@area area U4|0ec|x}) visits Thundertree from time to time, keeping a wary eye on its dangers. Some cultists also arrived recently (see {@area area U13|108|x}) to treat with a dragon that claims Thundertree as its domain (see {@area area U7|0f6|x}).": "尽管大多数僵尸早已化为尘土，但区域中弥漫的奇异魔法已经使当地的植被变异成了新的危险形态。如今很少有人敢冒险进入这座废弃的村庄，而那些冒险者也很少能在那里逗留太久——除了两个值得注意的例外。德鲁伊雷多斯（见{@area area U4|0ec|x}）偶尔会造访雷霆树，时刻警惕着周围的危险。最近还有一些教徒（见{@area area U13|108|x}）前来，与声称雷霆树为领地的一只龙进行交涉（见{@area area U7|0f6|x}）。",
	"As the party approaches the ruined settlement, read the following:": "当队伍接近废墟聚落时，请阅读以下内容：",
	"Gradually, the trail becomes an old, overgrown lane winding between dilapidated buildings choked with vines and brush. In the middle of the settlement rises a steep hill, upon which stands a stone tower with a partially collapsed roof and an adjoining cottage. A dirt road hugs the base of the hill and wends its way between old stone houses, many of which are roofless ruins. Other buildings appear intact. The whole place is eerily silent.": "逐渐，小径变成了一条古老的、长满杂草的小巷，在破败的建筑物之间蜿蜒而过，这些建筑物被藤蔓和灌木覆盖。在定居点的中心矗立着一座陡峭的小山，山上矗立着一座石塔，顶部部分坍塌，旁边有一座小屋。一条土路环绕山脚，穿过古老的石屋之间，其中许多已经成为没有屋顶的废墟。其他建筑看起来完好无损。整个地方异常安静。",

	"Reidoth is adept at staying away from the ash zombies that overrun the village, as well as avoiding the area's mutated plants. She knows that dangerous spiders lurk in the ruins at the base of the hill, and she suspects that miscreants have a hideout on the eastern side of town—she's seen \"people in black masks and cloaks\" (the cultists) skulking around. However, she is most concerned that a young green dragon has moved into the tower ({@area area U7|0f6|x}) since the last time she was here. She warns the characters of all these threats and suggests that they leave Thundertree before they're killed.": "雷多斯（Reidoth）擅长避开充斥村庄的火山灰僵尸，以及避开该地区的变异植物。她知道在山脚废墟中潜伏着危险的蜘蛛，她怀疑罪犯们在镇的东侧有一个藏身之处——她看到“戴着黑色面具和斗篷的人”（邪教徒）在四处潜伏。然而，她最担心的是自从上次来这里以来，一只年轻的绿龙已经搬进了塔楼（{@area area U7|0f6|x}）。她警告角色们要注意这些威胁，并建议他们在被杀之前离开桑德树（Thundertree）。",

The enclave works to restore and preserve the natural order by keeping the elemental forces of the world in check, preventing civilization and the wilderness from destroying one another, and helping others survive the perils of the wilds. As such, Reidoth doesn't want to rile the goblins without good cause. If any of the characters appear to respect her position and beliefs, the druid tells them where to find the goblin stronghold. Otherwise, Reidoth offers a bargain: if the characters chase off Venomfang the dragon in area U7, she'll provide directions.": "如果角色询问关于Cragmaw Castle，蕾多思会犹豫提供方向。她是翡翠飞地（Emerald Enclave）的成员，这是一个遍布广泛的荒野生存主义者团体，他们在维护自然秩序的同时清除不自然的威胁。该飞地致力于通过控制世界的元素力量，防止文明和荒野相互摧毁，并帮助他人在荒野中生存来恢复和保护自然秩序。因此，蕾多思不想没有充分理由就激怒哥布林。如果角色中有任何人表现出尊重她的立场和信仰，德鲁伊会告诉他们哪里可以找到哥布林的据点。否则，蕾多思会提出一个交易：如果角色们赶走U7区域的龙毒牙（Venomfang），她会提供方向。",

	"If the party helps Reidoth by chasing off Venomfang, the druid privately approaches certain members of the group and urges them to join the Emerald Enclave.

The blights are fearless and attack until destroyed.": "每轮进行3轮，两个树枝模糊向南门口前进，另外两个向北门口前进。第3轮时，针刺模糊跟随，每个都朝着不同的门口移动。这些模糊是无畏的，会一直攻击直到被摧毁。",
	"At an intersection near the middle of the village, a narrow lane winds up the steep hillside to the north. Directly to the south is a ruined building that might've been a store or workshop.

This caused the entire arch to collapse atop the shrine, damaging it.": "由周围荒野搜集的材料建造而成，（幸运神龛）由一堆奇怪的岩石和石头组成。镇民们并不知道，神龛中的一块石头原本来自方尖碑。这块小的黑曜石碎片曾是神龛拱门的中心多年，直到一群地精在清晨时分走进来，将其从原位取走。这导致整个拱门坍塌在神龛上，造成了损坏。",

You see two figures attempting to move some of the shrine's larger rocks: the elf Sister Garaele and a human girl no more than ten years old.": "曾经是一座由五颜六色的石头和供品构成的引人注目的堆石祭坛，现在看起来岌岌可危。你看到两个人正试图移动一些祭坛上较大的石头：精灵加雷尔修女和一个年龄不到十岁的人类女孩。",
	"The young girl working alongside Sister Garaele is Tamara Stonehill, the daughter of innkeeper Toblen Stonehill. Early one morning, Tamara visited the Shrine of Luck to pray with her mother, Trilena. However, as they were walking up, part of the shrine collapsed, and three small creatures—the goblins—hurried away from the rubble carrying a stone. Tamara and Trilena have since been helping Sister Garaele rebuild the shrine; Tamara is sorting through smaller chunks of rubble to find still-usable pieces, while Trilena is retrieving food and water at the Stonehill Inn.": "在与加雷尔修女一起工作的年轻女孩是塔玛拉·斯通希尔(Tamara Stonehill)，是旅店老板托布伦·斯通希尔(Toblen Stonehill)的女儿。 一大清早，塔玛拉和她的母亲特里莲娜一起去了幸运神龛祈祷。然而，当她们走近时，神龛的一部分倒塌了，三只小生物——哥布林——匆匆从瓦砾中逃走，还带着一块石头。此后，塔玛拉和特里莲娜一直在帮助加雷尔修女重建神龛；塔玛拉正在整理较小的瓦砾，以找到仍可用的碎片，而特里莲娜则在斯通希尔旅店取食物和水。",

If asked for information, she refers the characters to Trilena and Tamara.": "在神龛被破坏几个小时后，加拉艾尔修女从一次哈珀任务中回到芬德林。因此，她对发生的事情知之甚少。如果被询问情况，她会把角色们引荐给特里莲娜和塔玛拉。",
	"Regardless, Garaele is visibly upset that the shrine has been desecrated. She gladly accepts any offers of help to rebuild and rededicate the shrine. A character can try to help by making a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}), Wisdom ({@skill Religion}), or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. On a failed check, the shrine crumbles more, and the character takes 2 ({@dice 1d4}) bludgeoning damage from falling rocks.": "尽管如此，加拉尔(Garaele)明显感到心烦意乱，因为神龛被亵渎了。她乐意接受任何帮助来重建和重新奉献神龛。角色可以尝试通过进行一次DC 15的感知({@skill Survival})、感知({@skill Religion})或敏捷({@skill Acrobatics})检定来帮助。如果检定失败，神龛会进一步崩塌，角色会受到2点({@dice 1d4})来自掉落石块的钝击伤害。",
	"After three successful checks, the shrine is repaired.": "经过三次成功的检查，神龛已经修复。",

	"Both Trilena and Tamara saw three squat shadows hurry away from the shrine after it fell. Tamara swears she also heard a gaggle of shrill voices just before it fell, though she didn't understand the language the voices were speaking.": "特里莱娜(Trilena)和塔玛拉(Tamara)都看到三个矮胖的影子在神龛倒塌后匆匆离开。塔玛拉发誓她在神龛倒塌之前还听到一群尖声的声音，尽管她听不懂那些声音在说什么语言。",
	"Based on how the stones fell, Tamara figures that someone must have taken the centerpiece of the shrine's rock archway without replacing it. She remarks that the stone was a very pretty, shimmery black color.": "根据石头掉落的方式，塔玛拉推断肯定有人拿走了神龛石拱门的中心石头却没有放回去。她说那块石头是一块非常漂亮、闪闪发光的黑色。",

Most townsfolk are still wary of the place, though a few have started coming to the tavern for cheaper drinks.": "随着角色们削弱了红袍团的行动，沉睡巨人酒馆不再是犯罪分子的聚会地点。大多数镇民仍然对这个地方持谨慎态度，尽管有一些人开始前来这家酒馆喝更便宜的酒。",
	"Beyond its connection to the Redbrands, the Sleeping Giant is known for its collection of curios, amassed from travelers visiting Phandalin. One such curio was embedded in the bar itself: a near-spherical piece of glittering obsidian. Local myth says it is a piece of the {@condition petrified} giant that gave the tavern its name. In reality, this is an obelisk shard.": "除了与红袍帮有关之外，睡熊酒馆还以其收藏的珍玩而闻名，这些珍玩是从访问芬德林的旅行者那里积累而来的。其中一件珍玩嵌在酒吧本身：一块近似球形的闪闪发光的黑曜石。当地传说称其为给这家酒馆命名的{@condition petrified}巨人的一部分。实际上，这是一块方尖碑碎片。",

The bar's owner, a dwarf named Grista, chased the goblins away, but not before the tavern sustained significant damage.": "在夜间，一群地精闯入了睡熊酒馆，砸毁吧台以取出方尖碑碎片，并洗劫了厨房。酒馆的老板，一位名叫格里斯塔(Grista)的矮人，赶走了地精，但酒馆在此过程中遭受了重大损坏。",
	"The taproom of the Sleeping Giant is quiet, save for the occasional thunk of tankard against table. The bar itself is in shambles, the wooden stiles smashed to splinters and the top split in half. Nevertheless, a tall purple tiefling works behind the broken counter, diligently cleaning mugs and plates under the watchful eye of the surly dwarf owner, Grista.": "沉睡巨人旅馆的酒吧很安静，偶尔只有啤酒杯碰撞桌子的声音。酒吧本身已经破败不堪，木制柱子被砸成碎片，台面裂成两半。尽管如此，一个高大的紫色鬼族人正站在破损的柜台后面，认真地清洁着杯子和盘子，受着脾气暴躁的矮人老板格里斯塔的监视。",
	"Grista gruffly greets the characters. The dwarf makes it clear that she despises Harbin and his attempts to govern the town, but she wants the criminals who destroyed her bar brought to justice. She gives the characters free rein to poke around the tavern as necessary.": "格里斯塔(Grista)粗暴地向角色们打招呼。这位矮人明确表示她鄙视哈宾(Harbin)及其试图管理这个小镇的努力，但她希望那些摧毁她酒吧的罪犯能够受到制裁。她允许角色们自由查看酒馆内的一切。",

	"The Sleeping Giant's kitchen area suffered less damage than the bar, but many of the barrels and crates of foodstuffs have been ransacked.

These coins, stolen from the tavern's lockbox, spilled from the goblins' bag as Grista chased them away.": "《沉睡巨人》的厨房区受到的损坏比酒吧要轻，但许多装满食物的桶和箱子已经被洗劫一空。当一个角色在扫描厨房时成功通过一次DC 15的感知({@skill Perception})检查，会注意到地面上散落着一串铜币和银币。这些硬币是从酒馆的保险箱中偷走的，从哥布林的袋子里掉出来，当Grista赶走他们时。",

	"A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check intuits that Wheel-of-Fortune is hiding something. When pressed, Wheel-of-Fortune explains that every drink they poured ended up being slightly \"off\" in some way: the ale often caused a headache, and the mead shimmered with an oil-slick iridescence. Wheel-of-Fortune doesn't know how this keeps happening and is embarrassed by their ineptitude, believing they're cursed. (Unbeknownst to them, close proximity to the obelisk shard in the counter caused the ill effects.)": "一名成功通过DC 12的感知({@skill Insight})检定的角色直觉到“命运之轮”(Wheel-of-Fortune)在隐瞒某事。在追问下，“命运之轮”解释说，他们倒出的每一杯饮料都在某种程度上有些“不对劲”：麦酒经常会引起头痛，蜜酒则闪烁着油膜般的七彩光泽。命运之轮不知道这是怎么发生的，对自己的无能感到尴尬，认为自己被诅咒了。(他们并不知道，柜台上的方尖碑碎片导致了这些不良影响。)",

	"Zorzula's Rest is an ancient duergar mining outpost located in one of the Sword Mountains east of Phandalin.

Ruxithid's overlords described the obelisk to him and used powers drawn from the Far Realm to roughly locate the obelisk's scattered pieces.": "在通过一次 DC 15 智力检定（{@skill Investigation}）后，角色还会发现一张粗糙的草图，描绘了一座由黑色石头制成的残破方尖碑。图中有四块碎片被划掉，而另外三块被圈出。这是涅瑞斯方尖碑的草图，被划掉的四块碎片对应着在范德林找到的碎片，而被圈出的三块对应着还需要找到的三块碎片。鲁西西德的上级向他描述了这座方尖碑，并利用来自远境的力量粗略地定位了方尖碑的散落碎片。",
	"Although Ruxithid was their leader, the Sawplee goblins aren't particularly loyal to him. Ruxithid ruled through fear and put the goblins into harm's way for his own selfish quest for power.": "尽管卢克西西德（Ruxithid）是他们的领袖，索普利（Sawplee）地精并不特别忠诚于他。卢克西西德通过恐惧统治，并将地精置于危险之中，只为了他自己对权力的自私追求。",
	"Without their wicked leader to push them, the goblins are peaceful and curious, if mischievous. It's up to the characters how they want to handle the Sawplee goblins. The townspeople of Phandalin dislike the goblins, but the characters can broker an easy peace if they wish for hostilities between the Sawplees and the townspeople to end.": "没有邪恶的领袖推动，哨普利(Sawplee)地精们变得和平好奇，尽管调皮捣蛋。角色们可以自行决定如何处理哨普利地精。芬德林(Phandalin)的镇民们不喜欢地精，但如果他们希望哨普利地精和镇民之间的敌对关系结束，角色们可以促成轻松的和平。",
	"After defeating Ruxithid and learning that there are larger, more sinister forces at play, the characters should realize Phandalin is in danger. They'll likely wish to return to Phandalin to rest and plan their next moves. If the players need a nudge in this direction, remind them that the kidnap victims in the sanctum need food and medical attention as soon as possible. The survivors may not be strong enough to make the journey to Phandalin themselves, requiring the characters to escort them to town. Upon their return to Phandalin, Harbin pays the characters the agreed upon amount and thanks them deeply for their assistance.": "在击败了Ruxithid并得知有更大、更邪恶的势力在起作用后，角色们应该意识到费伦德林正处于危险之中。他们很可能希望返回费伦德林休息并计划下一步行动。如果玩家们需要在这个方向上得到一点提示，提醒他们圣所中被绑架的受害者需要尽快得到食物和医疗照顾。幸存者可能没有足够的力气自己前往费伦德林，需要角色们护送他们到城镇。当他们回到费伦德林时，Harbin支付给角色们约定的金额，并对他们的帮助表示深深的感谢。",
	"Regardless of the characters' choices during this part of the adventure, the goblins have already delivered four obelisk shards from Phandalin to the mind flayers. The adventure now becomes a race against the clock to find the remaining three shards.": "无论角色在冒险中做出何种选择，哥布林已经将四块方尖碑碎片从法丹林运送给了心灵食者。现在冒险变成了一场与时间赛跑，要找到剩下的三块碎片。",
	"The characters have defeated Ruxithid, the Sawplee goblin leader who collected fragments of a Netherese obelisk. However, an unsettling truth has emerged: Ruxithid acted at the behest of much more powerful overlords who want the obelisk pieces to impose some terrible fate upon the town.": "角色们已经击败了拉克西西德(Ruxithid)，这位收集了尼瑟尔方尖碑碎片的索普利(Sawplee)地精首领。然而，一个令人不安的事实浮出水面：拉克西西德是受到更强大的统治者的指使行事，他们想要利用方尖碑碎片对镇上施加一些可怕的命运。",
	"The characters discovered Ruxithid's map, which shows the locations of the remaining obelisk pieces. (This {@adventure map|PaBTSO|6|The Sawplee Goblins' Map} is shown on this page; you should feel free to distribute it to your players as a handout.) Further, some townspeople are still missing and could be captives at one of these locations. To save Phandalin and its missing inhabitants, the characters must collect the remaining obelisk shards before the overlords do. Along the way, the heroes learn more about the shadowy threat looming over Phandalin.": "角色们发现了Ruxithid的地图，展示了剩余方尖碑碎片的位置。 (这个 {@adventure map|PaBTSO|6|The Sawplee Goblins' Map} 在这一页上显示；你可以随意将其分发给你的玩家作为资料。) 此外，一些镇民仍然失踪，可能被囚禁在这些地点之一。 为了拯救芬德林及其失踪居民，角色们必须在霸主们之前收集剩余的方尖碑碎片。 在此过程中，英雄们会了解更多关于悬在芬德林上方的阴影威胁。",
	"The Sawplee goblins indirectly served three mind flayers that draw power from a malevolent Far Realm godlet named Ilvaash. Using their godlet as a warped sort of elder brain, these mind flayers are even more alien than others of their kind. (For more information, see {@adventure chapter 7|PaBTSO|7}.)": "Sawplee地精间接地侍奉了三个取力于邪恶远境神灵伊尔瓦什的触须怪。这些触须怪将他们的神灵作为一种扭曲的长者脑使用，使他们比同类更加异类。(更多信息，请参见{@adventure chapter 7|PaBTSO|7}。)",
	"Mind flayer activity in the area around Phandalin isn't new; centuries ago, as evidenced in Zorzula's Rest, mind flayers swept through the Underdark beneath and around Phandalin, consuming or destroying all in their path. That illithid empire eventually fell, but the mind flayer threat never entirely subsided. Now, mind flayers pose more of a threat to Phandalin than ever before.": "芬德林（Phandalin）周围的触须怪（Mind flayer）活动并不新鲜；几个世纪前，正如在佐祖拉之墓（Zorzula's Rest）中所证明的那样，触须怪席卷了芬德林周围和下方的地底世界，吞噬或摧毁一切。那个邪恶的魔导帝国最终崩溃了，但触须怪的威胁从未完全消失。现在，触须怪对芬德林构成的威胁比以往任何时候都更大。",
	"The mind flayers seek to enact a dreadful ritual that will transform the entire population of Phandalin into mind flayers.": "触须怪寻求执行一场可怕的仪式，将范达林的整个人口转变为触须怪。",
	"As if that brutal process weren't terrifying enough, the ritual would work from a significant distance—even from the Far Realm itself, as described in {@adventure chapter 8|PaBTSO|8}—and would affect individuals on a large scale. However, the fanatics learned from Ilvaash that transforming beings into mind flayers from afar requires a powerful source of magic.": "就算那残酷的过程本身已经够可怕了，这种仪式还能在相当远的距离内生效——甚至可以来自远境本身，就像在{@adventure chapter 8|PaBTSO|8}中描述的那样——并且会对大规模的个体产生影响。然而，狂热者们从伊尔瓦什(Ilvaash)那里学到，远距离将生物转化为智力食人魔需要强大的魔法源泉。",
	"After much communing and research, the mind flayer fanatics determined that the Netherese obelisk can power their ritual. Long ago, this obelisk was broken into fragments that are now scattered around the region. The mind flayer fanatics need to collect these fragments and rebuild the obelisk as completely as possible so the ancient object can power their ritual.": "经过长时间的交流和研究，触须怪狂热者们确定了尼瑟尔(Netherese)方尖碑可以为他们的仪式提供能量。很久以前，这座方尖碑被打碎成碎片，如今散落在该地区各处。触须怪狂热者们需要收集这些碎片，并尽可能完整地重建方尖碑，以便这古老的物品可以为他们的仪式提供能量。",
	"The characters learned in {@adventure chapter 5|PaBTSO|5} about four obelisk shards around Phandalin that the Sawplee goblins gathered. The mind flayer fanatics possess these shards now, but the fanatics need as many obelisk fragments as possible to ensure their ritual will succeed.": "在{@adventure chapter 5|PaBTSO|5}中学到了有关费安达林周围四块方尖碑碎片的情报，这些碎片是萨普利地精收集的。现在，控制这些碎片的是那些思维吸食者狂热者，但他们需要尽可能多的方尖碑碎片来确保他们的仪式能够成功。",
	"The Sawplees' map reveals the locations of three other fragments: an abandoned dwarven temple called Talhundereth, the crypt beneath it, and a subterranean trading nexus called Gibbet Crossing. These locations are in the Starmetal Hills, several days northeast of Phandalin.": "Sawplees 家族的地图揭示了另外三个碎片的位置：一个被遗弃的矮人神庙叫做塔尔亨德雷斯(Talhundereth)，它下面的地下墓穴，以及一个地下交易枢纽叫做吊刑枢纽(Gibbet Crossing)。这些地点位于星金山脉，在芬德林(Phandalin)东北数天的路程。",
	"In the previous chapter, a loyal grimlock servant of {@creature Qunbraxel|PaBTSO} (an ally of the mind flayer fanatics that's described later in this adventure) traveled to Zorzula's Rest to retrieve the shards before the adventurers arrived to confront the goblins.": "在前一章中，{@creature Qunbraxel|PaBTSO}（后来在这次冒险中描述的心灵吸食者狂热者的盟友）的忠诚格里姆洛克仆人前往佐祖拉之墓，以在冒险者赶到对抗地精之前取回碎片。",
	"In this chapter, the characters might prevent the mind flayers from acquiring the other three fragments. The fanatics can proceed with the fragments they have, but the more obelisk pieces the mind flayers acquire, the more difficult it will be to stop their ritual. The characters must race against the clock to keep the mind flayers and their lackeys from recovering more of the shattered obelisk.": "在这一章中，角色们可能会阻止（mind flayers）获取另外三块碎片。狂热者们可以继续使用他们手头的碎片，但（mind flayers）获得的方尖碑碎片越多，阻止他们仪式的难度就会越大。角色们必须在时间紧迫的情况下，竭尽全力阻止（mind flayers）及其走狗恢复更多破碎的方尖碑碎片。",
	"If stopping the threat against Phandalin isn't enough motivation for the characters, concern about the still-missing townspeople should prompt them to follow the previous chapter's clues. The characters rescued some kidnapped townspeople in {@adventure chapter 5|PaBTSO|5}, but there are eleven people still missing, and the locations on the goblins' map are the only leads about where these victims might be. The characters won't find these victims in this chapter, but they will find them later in the adventure.": "如果对抗费兰德林的威胁还不足以激励角色们，对仍然失踪的镇民的担忧应该促使他们追随前一章的线索。角色们在{@adventure chapter 5|PaBTSO|5}解救了一些被绑架的镇民，但仍有十一个人失踪，地图上标记的地点是关于这些受害者可能所在地的唯一线索。角色们在本章找不到这些受害者，但他们会在冒险的后续中找到他们。",
	"In addition to the individuals below, other townspeople might still be missing, at your discretion. Consider identifying additional still-missing townspeople as individuals the characters are familiar with. Gwyn, Grista, Sister Garaele, Ander, and Halia haven't been kidnapped, but anyone else the characters might have come across in Phandalin might be victims.": "除了以下这些人，其他的镇民可能仍然失踪，由你自行决定。考虑将额外失踪的镇民确定为角色熟悉的人。Gwyn(格温), Grista(格里斯塔), Sister Garaele(加拉尔修女), Ander(安德)和Halia(哈莉娅)没有被绑架，但角色可能在芬德林遇到的其他人可能成为受害者。",

Ultimately, the characters can choose their course of action.": "格温相信有关地精神秘统治者的答案一定存在于这些危险的地方。她敦促大家谨慎，并建议塔尔亨德雷斯（Talhundereth）可能是一个比吉贝特十字路口（Gibbet Crossing）更好的起点，仅仅因为她对塔尔亨德雷斯了解更多。吉贝特十字路口更为遥远，其危险也是未知的。最终，角色们可以选择他们的行动路线。",
	"Before they leave, the characters have more opportunities to help the people of Phandalin—as well as to gain a base of operations and learn more about the threat against the town—by undertaking the following quests.": "在他们离开之前，角色们有更多机会帮助费兰德林（Phandalin）的居民，同时也可以通过完成以下任务来建立行动基地并了解更多关于对该镇的威胁。",

	"After Pip followed the gemmules for a while, the creatures dropped from sight. They fell through the top of a dwarven ruin and couldn't escape.": "皮普跟随着晶胞一段时间后，这些生物突然消失了。它们从一个矮人废墟的顶部掉了下去，无法逃脱。",
	"This put Pip in a quandary. He needed to tell someone about the monsters, but he knew he might get in trouble for leaving town. Worse, the monsters might escape, and no one would know where they'd gone. He watches the hole from behind a boulder while he decides what to do next.": "这让Pip陷入了困境。他需要告诉某人关于怪物，但他知道自己可能因为离开镇子而惹上麻烦。更糟糕的是，这些怪物可能会逃走，而没有人会知道它们去了哪里。他在一个大石头后面观察着洞口，同时决定接下来该怎么办。",

	"The most direct way to find Pip is to follow his tracks in the field. This requires a character to succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check. Alternatively, the characters might remember from their investigations in previous chapters that Pip is good friends with the halfling Carp Alderleaf. (Trilena Stonehill might even recommend talking to Carp.) Carp isn't allowed to venture far from Alderleaf Farm, but he points to where he saw Pip go into the hills.": "找到Pip最直接的方法是沿着田野上他的足迹追踪。这需要一个角色成功进行一次DC 14的智力检定({@skill Survival})。另外，角色们可能会记得在之前章节的调查中，Pip是与半身人Carp Alderleaf交好的。 (Trilena Stonehill甚至可能会建议与Carp交谈。) Carp不允许离开Alderleaf农场太远，但他指出了他看到Pip进入山丘的方向。",
	"It's easy to follow Pip's trail because he's following a trio of creatures that bounce on small, spindly feet. Characters who follow the trail for two miles find Pip hunkered behind a boulder. With obvious admiration for the characters, Pip explains his whole adventure.": "很容易跟踪派普的踪迹，因为他在追随一群用细长小脚蹦跳的生物。跟随这条踪迹两英里的角色发现派普蜷缩在一个大石头后面。派普对这些角色显然很钦佩，他解释了自己的整个冒险。",

The drow provided the duergar with security in exchange for inclusion in svirfneblin trade contracts, while the drow simultaneously negotiated fair prices for duergar goods. Tensions between the three groups were always present.

	"The duergar initially tried to mine metal for their cage workshop here, but they soon learned the svirfneblin provided better product. The door at the rear of the mine was installed later as an escape route that let many duergar flee the mind flayers during the attack.": "刚开始，矮人（duergar）试图在这里的矿坑里开采金属用于他们的笼子车间，但很快他们发现地底侏儒（svirfneblin）提供的产品更好。矿坑后面的门后来被安装，作为一个逃生通道，让许多矮人在被脑食人怪（mind flayers）袭击时逃脱。",

	"The long-ago collapse caused desperate times for the svirfneblin enclave. The tunnel once led to several other svirfneblin communities from which these svirfneblin acquired mithral, but the collapse proved too extensive for even the skilled tunnelers to safely excavate. The isolated svirfneblin began to rely on traders from Talhundereth to get mithral, even though this cut deeply into their profits.": "很久以前的崩塌给斯维夫内布林（Svirfneblin）聚居地带来了绝望的时刻。这条隧道曾经通往其他几个斯维夫内布林社区，这些斯维夫内布林从那里获取米萨利（mithral），但这次崩塌对于即使是技艺娴熟的挖掘者来说也太过广泛，无法安全地进行挖掘。孤立的斯维夫内布林开始依赖来自塔尔亨德雷斯（Talhundereth）的贸易商获取米萨利，尽管这严重侵蚀了他们的利润。",

A character can remove the bar from the other side by succeeding on a DC 15 Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|PHB}, or by succeeding on a DC 21 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to shove the door hard enough to break the bar. {@creature Qunbraxel|PaBTSO} rightly believes a passage to Talhundereth is behind the door, so the mind flayer sent grimlocks to investigate. The door bears marks from {@creature Qunbraxel|PaBTSO}'s grimlocks.

	"This room's blurry appearance is the result of a permanent magical effect from when the mind flayers burst into this room and slaughtered the svirfneblin.

This ruse worked; the mind flayers never entered the shrine or found the yochlol demon bound to protect it.": "当触须怪袭击时，黑暗精灵居民将大而空的金属柜移动到神龛（区域 G20）门前以将其隐藏起来。这个诡计奏效了；触须怪从未进入神龛，也没有发现被束缚在那里保护它的约克洛恶魔。",

	"The {@creature yochlol} Zuluthl was summoned by the priests of House Azfadiel, and it has remained here ever since. The demon knows that the Azfadiel drow here were killed a long time ago, but the fight was over too quickly for the yochlol to join. Although Zuluthl doesn't need to remain here, the yochlol considers itself on an extended break from the chaotic machinations of the Demonweb Pits. It enjoys the solitude and reacts violently to intruders.": "{@creature yochlol}祖鲁斯尔被阿兹法迪尔家族的祭司召唤出来，自那时以来一直留在这里。这个恶魔知道这里的阿兹法迪尔卓尔很久以前就被杀死了，但战斗结束得太快，以至于约克洛尔无法加入。尽管祖鲁斯尔不需要留在这里，但约克洛尔认为自己正在从混乱的蛛网深渊的阴谋中休息。它喜欢独处，并对入侵者做出激烈反应。",
	"The table contains several slate tablets filled with notes in Undercommon. Reviewing them reveals that the writer was eavesdropping on conversations between duergar and drow. Apart from dull trade information about sharing resources to get more money from traveling customers, the duergar were seeking a command word to activate a magical stone tower. The drow claimed ignorance. The notes indicate that the drow already researched the command word and were separately negotiating with the nearby svirfneblin about sharing it with them. The drow hoped to be paid twice for the same command word. Characters who spend at least 10 minutes reading the notes find a drawing of a tower with the Terran word for \"petrification\" written under it.

They hoped {@creature Qunbraxel|PaBTSO} would acquire the fragments, but {@creature Qunbraxel|PaBTSO} was more interested in establishing a court of grimlocks and turning Gibbet Crossing into a lair.

	"{@creature Qunbraxel|PaBTSO} guessed that the nearby fragment was somehow connected to the toppled tower that's blocking the way to the old drow vault. {@creature Qunbraxel|PaBTSO} ordered the grimlocks to bash through it, determined to eventually overcome the tower's regenerative protections. {@creature Qunbraxel|PaBTSO} isn't aware of the {@item Mudslick Tower|PaBTSO|mudslick tower's} nature, or even that it's a magic item wedged into the stone.": "{@creature Qunbraxel|PaBTSO} 猜测附近的碎片与倒塌的塔楼有某种联系，这座塔楼挡住了通往旧的卓尔德宝库的道路。{@creature Qunbraxel|PaBTSO} 命令格里姆洛克砸穿它，决心最终克服塔楼的再生保护。{@creature Qunbraxel|PaBTSO} 不知道它的{@item Mudslick Tower|PaBTSO|mudslick tower's}性质，甚至不知道它是嵌入石头中的魔法物品。",
	"{@creature Qunbraxel|PaBTSO} is less certain about the locations of the other fragments.

Tiny Humanoid figures in the town that are touched by the wavy lines appear to be transforming into mind flayers. Several mathematical formulas calculate the percentage of people who will transform into mind flayers. Variables in this equation produce different outcomes, from as few as three in ten to as many as seven in ten people transforming into mind flayers. The ritual painfully kills anyone who doesn't transform. If the characters haven't already figured it out, share the information in the \"{@area The Sinister Truth|224|x}\" and \"{@area The Ritual|225|x}\" sections at the beginning of the chapter.": "这些思想吞噬者身上散发出波浪状线条，延伸至一个描绘着费兰德林的草图，高出伊利西诺克数英里。镇上的微小人形图像被这些波浪线触及后，似乎正在变成思想吞噬者。几个数学公式计算了将会变成思想吞噬者的人的百分比。方程中的变量会产生不同的结果，从十人中有三人到十人中有七人变成思想吞噬者。这个仪式会痛苦地杀死任何没有变身的人。如果角色还没有弄清楚，可以在本章开头的\"{@area The Sinister Truth|224|x}\"和\"{@area The Ritual|225|x}\"部分分享这些信息。",

Unable to batter through the stone tower, the thieves starved to death amid the treasures they sought.": "这些骨骼是三名黑暗精灵窃贼的遗骸。他们在前往洗劫这个地窖的途中发现了方尖碑碎片。然而，方尖碑碎片中涌动的魔法最终导致了他们的厄运，因为它激活了附近的{@item mudslick tower|PaBTSO}，封锁了地窖唯一的出口。无法破坏石塔，窃贼们最终在他们所追求的财宝中饿死。",

	"While hunting obelisk fragments in the previous chapter, the characters learned of the fanatics' headquarters: a mind flayer enclave called Illithinoch deep in the Underdark below Phandalin. In this chapter, the characters learn more about the fanatics and rescue the kidnap victims from Phandalin. However, doing so—as well as stopping the ritual that threatens to turn Phandalin's townspeople into mind flayers—will be far more harrowing than the characters realize.": "在前一章中狩猎方尖碑碎片时，角色们得知了狂热者的总部：位于法丹林下方地下世界深处的一群控脑食人魔的聚居地，名为伊利西诺克 (Illithinoch)。在这一章中，角色们将了解更多关于狂热者的情况，并从法丹林解救被绑架的受害者。然而，这样做——以及阻止威胁将法丹林镇民变成控脑食人魔的仪式——将比角色们意识到的要艰难得多。",
	"The characters start this chapter knowing that a trio of mind flayers are preparing a ritual to transform surface-dwelling Humanoids into mind flayers.

	"Shortly after returning to Phandalin, the characters discover a passage beneath the town that leads into the Underdark and to Illithinoch. They set off through the Underdark to reach the deteriorating mind flayer stronghold of Illithinoch, facing threats along the way. In Illithinoch, the characters learn that the mind flayer fanatics already escaped through a gateway into the Far Realm. To pursue them, the characters must explore three Far Realm rifts scattered around Illithinoch and collect keys to open the gateway.": "回到范达林不久后，角色们发现了一条通往地下世界和伊利西诺克的地下通道。他们踏上了穿越地下世界前往日益恶化的掌控者伊利西诺克的旅程，在途中面临各种威胁。在伊利西诺克，角色们得知控制者狂热者已经通过一扇门逃往了遥远领域。为了追踪他们，角色们必须探索伊利西诺克周围散布的三个遥远领域裂隙，并收集打开门户的钥匙。",

	"Illithinoch was originally a stronghold of the mind flayer empire that rose to prominence across the Underdark and fell into obscurity centuries ago. The stronghold languished in disrepair when all but a few weakened mind flayers abandoned it. The mind flayers that remained continued their service to Illithinoch's elder brain, but the elder brain became obsessed with recovering their lost grandeur, and many mind flayers transformed themselves into tormented monsters called nothics.

	"The three most ruthless, domineering, and cunning mind flayers in Illithinoch spent their early lives scheming against one another.

	"The three mind flayers eventually heard a strange psychic call from a Far Realm godlet called Ilvaash, the Dissonant Psyche. Singing a siren song made up of profane and alien whispers, Ilvaash invited the three mind flayers to join the godlet's psyche—much like mind flayers normally join a hive mind—and leave behind any reliance on Illithinoch's diseased elder brain. Ilvaash also promised the three mind flayers vast power, but only if they would carry Ilvaash's worship into their world. The mind flayer fanatics agreed, embracing their new Far Realm godlet and in turn adopting new personalities that set them apart from their ilk.": "三个触须怪最终听到了一个来自遥远位面的小神，名为伊尔瓦什(Ilvaash)，即不和谐心灵。伊尔瓦什发出了一首由亵渎和外星语呢喃构成的塞壬之歌，邀请这三个触须怪加入小神的心灵中——就像触须怪通常加入脑囊体心灵一样——并抛弃对伊利西诺奇(Illithinoch)那颗病态的老脑的依赖。伊尔瓦什还承诺给予这三个触须怪巨大的力量，但前提是他们要将伊尔瓦什的崇拜带入他们的世界。这三个触须怪狂热者同意了，拥抱他们新的遥远位面小神，并相应地采纳了让他们与同类有所不同的新个性。",
	"The fanatics' plan hinges on the transformation ritual, as it promises to provide the beginnings of a new mind flayer empire on the surface—one that will spread Ilvaash's influence and crush any creatures who would resist.": "狂热者的计划取决于转化仪式，因为它承诺在地表上建立一个新的章鱼人帝国的开端，这将传播伊尔瓦什(Ilvaash)的影响力，并粉碎任何抵抗的生物。",
	"The three fanatics are {@creature Chishinix|PaBTSO}, {@creature Hashutu|PaBTSO}, and {@creature Voalsh|PaBTSO} (see {@adventure chapter 8|PaBTSO|8} for their stat blocks). Each considers themself the group's leader and Ilvaash's secret favorite. Although most mind flayers reject the notion of having individual personalities, the fanatics have embraced their own unique qualities, each hoping to become Ilvaash's most beloved.": "这三个狂热者分别是{@creature Chishinix|PaBTSO}、{@creature Hashutu|PaBTSO}和{@creature Voalsh|PaBTSO}（请参阅{@adventure chapter 8|PaBTSO|8}查看他们的属性块）。每个人都认为自己是团队的领袖，也是伊尔瓦什的秘密宠儿。尽管大多数食脑怪拒绝认同拥有个人特质的概念，但这些狂热者却拥抱了他们独特的品质，每个人都希望成为伊尔瓦什最心爱的人。",
	"{@creature Chishinix|PaBTSO} is a powerful psychic and sees flashes of future events. In return for this power, Ilvaash created a severed head that looks just like {@creature Chishinix|PaBTSO}'s. The mind flayer's psychic powers are tied to this severed head, which {@creature Chishinix|PaBTSO} must keep by her side. The severed head, in turn, reads {@creature Chishinix|PaBTSO}'s thoughts, ensuring she stays loyal to Ilvaash, and demands frequent treats. The severed head constantly leaks a greasy purple ichor that stains {@creature Chishinix|PaBTSO}'s clothing.": "{@creature Chishinix|PaBTSO} 是一位强大的通灵者，能够看到未来事件的闪现。作为交换，伊尔瓦什（Ilvaash）创造了一个看起来和{@creature Chishinix|PaBTSO}一模一样的被斩断的头颅。这位掠心魔的通灵能力与这个被斩断的头颅相连，{@creature Chishinix|PaBTSO} 必须将其随身携带。而这个被斩断的头颅则读取{@creature Chishinix|PaBTSO}的思绪，确保她对伊尔瓦什忠诚，并且要求经常被喂食。这个被斩断的头颅不断地渗出一种油腻的紫色粘液，弄脏{@creature Chishinix|PaBTSO}的衣物。",
	"{@creature Hashutu|PaBTSO} was paranoid that enemies waited around every corner and prayed to Ilvaash for more power. The Far Realm godlet answered, offering to trade {@creature Hashutu|PaBTSO}'s hands for tentacles that could warn him of incoming attacks. {@creature Hashutu|PaBTSO} gladly took the gift, and now his arms end in writhing tentacles that alert {@creature Hashutu|PaBTSO} of any movement or other threat that might lurk nearby.": "{@creature Hashutu|PaBTSO}对敌人潜伏在每个角落感到很恐慌，并祈祷伊尔瓦什(Ilvaash)赐予更多力量。远境之神小神回应了这个请求，提议用触须交换{@creature Hashutu|PaBTSO}的双手，这样就能警告他即将发生的攻击。{@creature Hashutu|PaBTSO}欣然接受了这份礼物，现在他的手臂末端长着扭动的触须，可以提醒{@creature Hashutu|PaBTSO}附近可能潜伏的任何移动或其他威胁。",
	"In a desperate bid to reclaim their autonomy, the other mind flayers of Illithinoch ambushed {@creature Voalsh|PaBTSO}. Right before the moment of her death, Ilvaash granted her wings, which unfurled from her back like enormous, writhing tentacles. {@creature Voalsh|PaBTSO} vanquished her foes from above in short order. Ever since, she regularly takes to the air to investigate her paranoid suspicions that her enemies might attack at any time. {@creature Voalsh|PaBTSO} has fashioned a magical, floating disk that she often uses to hover above the eye level of anyone else, unfurling her wings to emphasize her intimidating and otherworldly nature.": "在绝望的尝试中重新夺回他们的自主权，伊利西诺克（Illithinoch）的其他掌控者{@creature Voalsh|PaBTSO}遭到了伏击。就在她临死之际，伊尔瓦什（Ilvaash）赐予她翅膀，从她的背后展开，如同巨大而扭曲的触手。{@creature Voalsh|PaBTSO} 迅速从空中击败了她的敌人。从那时起，她经常飞上天空，调查她偏执的怀疑，认为敌人随时可能发动攻击。{@creature Voalsh|PaBTSO} 制作了一个魔法的漂浮圆盘，她经常用来悬停在任何其他人的眼睛水平以上，展开她的翅膀以强调她令人生畏和超凡脱俗的本质。",
	"The fanatics aren't present when the characters arrive. They recently retreated through a gateway into the Far Realm, taking the Netherese obelisk pieces and Phandalin prisoners with them. The gateway closed behind them, but the characters can open the gateway again by exploring three Far Realm rifts around Illithinoch. (The rifts are in areas {@area X4|361|x}, {@area X5|364|x}, and {@area X10|374|x}, and they are further described in the \"{@area Far Realm Rifts|394|x}\" section later in this chapter.)

	"Ceilings throughout Illithinoch are 14 feet high.": "伊利西诺克（Illithinoch）各处的天花板高度为14英尺。",
	"Illithinoch's heavy stone doors lack handles or latches. When a creature looks directly at a door for more than a few seconds, it swings open and assails the creature opening it with a jarring mental pulse that sounds to the creature like the clashing of cymbals. This pulse deals no damage, but all creatures other than mind flayers find it unpleasant. No one else within Illithinoch can hear this mental pulse except for the infected elder brain in {@area area X15|389|x}, which uses it to keep track of movement through the stronghold. An open door swings shut after 1 minute unless something is in the doorway, in which case it swings shut once the doorway is clear.": "伊利希诺克（Illithinoch）的沉重石门没有把手或门闩。当生物直视门超过几秒钟时，门会自动打开，并对打开它的生物发出一股震撼的精神脉冲，听起来像是铙钹的碰撞声。这股脉冲不会造成伤害，但除了掌控者之外的所有生物都会觉得不舒服。伊利希诺克内的其他人听不到这种精神脉冲，除了{@area area X15|389|x}中的被感染的老脑，它利用这种脉冲来追踪要塞内的移动。打开的门会在1分钟后自动关闭，除非门口有物体，此时门会在门口清空后关闭。",
	"The infected elder brain at Illithinoch's center ({@area area X15|389|x}) remains aware of the characters moving throughout the stronghold due to its Creature Sense ability. If a character has the {@condition incapacitated} condition in Illithinoch, the infected elder brain establishes a Psychic Link with the character and determines the character's intentions.": "在伊利西诺克中心的被感染的长者脑（{@area area X15|389|x}）通过其生物感应能力仍然意识到在要塞内移动的角色。如果一个角色在伊利西诺克中有{@condition incapacitated}状态，被感染的长者脑将与该角色建立心灵联系，并了解角色的意图。",
	"The psychic link remains until the creature shakes it off, as described in the infected elder brain's stat block, or until the linked creature leaves Illithinoch (including by passing through the Far Realm rifts).": "直到生物摆脱这种联系，或者直到被链接的生物离开伊利西诺克((Illithinoch))（包括通过远境裂缝穿过）, 通灵联系仍然存在，就像感染的长者脑的属性块中描述的那样。",
	"Mind flayers prefer the aesthetics of sweeping lines to sharp angles, and they've had generations to mold Illithinoch to their preferences. Most corners are rounded, even those between floors and walls and between walls and ceilings. This makes the stronghold feel unsettlingly organic to most creatures.": "思想吸食者更喜欢流畅线条而非锐利角度，他们已经有几代人的时间来塑造伊利西诺克(`Illithinoch`)以符合他们的喜好。大多数角落都是圆润的，即使是楼层和墙壁之间，以及墙壁和天花板之间也是如此。这使得这座要塞对大多数生物来说感觉令人不安地有机。",
	"The fanatics have carved symbols sacred to Ilvaash on the walls and doors throughout Illithinoch. These are most often knots of tentacles, blood-soaked brains, and jagged lines reminiscent of jaws. These symbols all move slightly when viewed for more than a moment: tentacles writhe, brains pulse, and jaws gnash. This movement ceases if the infected elder brain is destroyed.": "狂热者在伊利西诺克(Illithinoch)的墙壁和门上雕刻了伊尔瓦什(Ilvaash)神圣的符号。这些符号通常是触手的结，浸满鲜血的脑袋，以及类似下颚的锯齿线条。这些符号在超过一刻钟的观察后会略微移动：触手扭动，脑袋跳动，下颚咬合。如果被感染的长者脑被摧毁，这种移动就会停止。",
	"Illithinoch was originally lightless, but pinpricks of eerie green light from the Far Realm now suffuse the stronghold, casting it in {@quickref Vision and Light||2||dim light}.": "伊利西诺克 (Illithinoch) 最初是没有光线的，但现在来自远域的怪异绿光点缀着这座要塞，使其呈现出 {@quickref Vision and Light||2||dim light}。",
	"Rooms in Illithinoch the mind flayer fanatics claimed as their own (areas {@area X3|35e|x}, {@area X7|36b|x}, {@area X8|36e|x}, and {@area X14|385|x}) are inscribed with messages in Qualith, a form of tactile writing. Mind flayers use their tentacles to read Qualith, which is composed in four-line stanzas indecipherable to other creatures. A creature that touches a Qualith inscription, however, can receive fragmentary insight into the multilayered thoughts contained in it.": "伊利西诺克 (Illithinoch) 的房间被那些思想吸血鬼狂热者们宣称为自己的领地 (区域 {@area X3|35e|x}, {@area X7|36b|x}, {@area X8|36e|x}, 和 {@area X14|385|x})，上面刻有奎里斯 (Qualith) 文字。思想吸血鬼使用触手阅读奎里斯，这种文字以四行诗的形式组成，其他生物无法解读。然而，触碰奎里斯铭文的生物可以接收到其中包含的多层思想的片段洞察。",
	"A non-illithid who wants to understand a Qualith inscription in Illithinoch can make a DC 18 Intelligence check to interpret the inscription. A failed attempt results in a crushing headache and requires the creature to succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw.

A {@spell comprehend languages} spell provides understanding of the inscription roughly equivalent to what a mind flayer would get from it.": "一个非思想君主想要理解伊利西诺克（Illithinoch）中的夸利思（Qualith）铭文，可以进行一次智力检定（DC 18）来解释这个铭文。失败的尝试会导致剧烈头痛，并需要该生物成功通过一次感知豁免检定（DC 13）。在未通过检定的情况下，生物会受到17 ({@dice 5d6}) 精神伤害，通过检定则伤害减半。一次{@spell comprehend languages}法术可以让生物对铭文有大致相当于思想君主所得到的理解。",
	"The following locations are keyed to map 7.2.": "以下位置对应地图7.2。",
	"The long tunnel ends at an immense double door. An eerie green light emanates from the seam.": "长长的隧道尽头是一扇巨大的双门。从门缝中散发出一种怪异的绿光。",

Lounging against the south wall are two mind flayers, their face tentacles periodically gesticulating.": "在这个长房间的东端，一座巨大的雕像描绘了一个巨大的（心灵吞噬者(Mind Flayer)），双臂伸展开来，每只手拿着一颗大脑。这座雕像由一块绿色石头制成，尽管大脑上覆盖着绿色黏液，从雕像的手滴落到地板上形成一滩。墙壁上装饰着流畅的图案。靠在南墙上的是两只（心灵吞噬者(Mind Flayer)），它们的面部触手不时地做出手势。",
	"Two {@creature Mind Flayer||mind flayers} named Shalghast and Ulthundul guard this room while engaging in telepathic conversation, but they aren't expecting an attack. The fanatics have told the mind flayers to expect surface cultists, such as the aberrant zealots who reside elsewhere in Illithinoch, or minions delivering obelisk fragments. Both mind flayers are imperious and demanding. Shalghast does the communicating, while Ulthundul casts {@spell detect thoughts} to try to uncover any trickery.": "两个名为夏尔加斯特(Shalghast)和乌尔杜杜尔(Ulthundul)的{@creature Mind Flayer||mind flayers}守卫着这个房间，同时进行心灵交流，但他们并没有料到会遭受攻击。狂热者已经告诉脑鞭怪要准备迎接地表邪教徒，比如居住在伊利希诺克(Illithinoch)其他地方的畸变狂热者，或者运送方尖碑碎片的爪牙。两个脑鞭怪都非常傲慢和要求严格。夏尔加斯特负责交流，而乌尔杜杜尔则施展{@spell detect thoughts}来尝试揭露任何诡计。",

	"The infected elder brain's proximity magically creates the mucus that drips from the statue. The mucus is bland but nutritious, and oddly mentally fortifying; if the mind flayers here are on good terms with the characters, they might invite the characters to partake in the brain drippings.

	"A pool against the room's north wall is ringed by a low wall bearing repeated motifs of brains and twisting spinal columns interlocked with one another.

The figures are engrossed in discussion.": "房间北墙边的一个池塘被一堵低墙环绕着，墙上反复出现大脑和扭曲的脊柱相互交错的图案。锈迹斑斑的镣铐悬挂在池塘附近的天花板上，池塘旁站着两个人形的身影。两个身影都穿着黑袍，其中一个脖子上还有触手在蠕动。这两个身影正在沉浸在讨论中。",
	"In this former feeding chamber, an {@creature aberrant zealot|PaBTSO} named Duoro Engletor is instructing a human {@creature cult fanatic} named Larnon Veddin. Both are neutral evil Far Realm scholars who were driven from Neverwinter when their nascent Far Realm cult was exposed. Whispers from Ilvaash led the pair here. Duoro wholly embraced Ilvaash's malignant faith, resulting in his physical transformation. He can't speak above a hoarse whisper, and black eyes continually sprout and close across his face. Larnon has been slower to accept the \"gifts\" of the Far Realm and give up his humanity, so Duoro is lecturing him about Ilvaash.": "在这个前喂养室里，一名名为杜罗·恩格雷托{@creature aberrant zealot|PaBTSO}的人正在指导一名名为拉农·维丁{@creature cult fanatic}的人类。两人都是中立邪恶的异界学者，在他们的新生异界教派被揭露后被驱逐出了无冬城。伊尔瓦什的低语引导着这对人来到这里。杜罗完全接受了伊尔瓦什的邪恶信仰，导致他身体发生了变化。他无法大声说话，脸上不断长出并闭合着黑色的眼睛。拉农则较慢地接受了异界的“礼物”并放弃了自己的人性，所以杜罗正在向他讲授有关伊尔瓦什的知识。",

	"Duoro is easy to fool, as he's eager to believe that the characters are mind flayer minions, or converts to the veneration of Ilvaash or the Far Realm itself. Tricking Duoro requires a successful DC 12 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check.": "杜罗(Duoro)很容易被愚弄，因为他渴望相信这些角色是控制者的手下，或者是转变为崇拜伊尔瓦什(Ilvaash)或远境(Far Realm)本身的人。欺骗杜罗需要成功通过 DC 12 魅力检定({@skill Deception})。",
	"If Duoro believes the characters are allies, he shares the following:": "如果杜罗(Duoro)相信这些角色是盟友，他会分享以下内容：",
	"Duoro relays that Ilvaash was formed from cerebral matter the mind flayer god Ilsensine left behind upon leaving the Far Realm.

	"When Illithinoch was part of the old mind flayer empire, its mind flayer denizens shared knowledge and plans with their minions in this lecture hall (they only rarely shared knowledge with each other here, relying instead on the elder brain to share necessary knowledge among mind flayers).

Bashudu can explain how the three mind flayer fanatics who took over the stronghold traded it and the other nothics to Naruv to scribe their bolstering rune here.

	"Phandalin has changed since the characters' last visit. The mind flayer fanatics of the godlet Ilvaash have begun their ritual, and the open rifts to the Far Realm directly beneath the town have accelerated the townsfolk's transformation. The four residents who began transforming at the start of the last chapter—Sister Garaele, Ander, Halia Thornton, and Wheel-of-Fortune—have undergone extreme changes. They're locked in their homes to protect themselves and others. Regular, cautious visits from their friends keep these four people tenuously grounded, so there haven't been any further violent incidents.": "自角色上次访问以来，法达林（Phandalin）已经发生了变化。以伊尔瓦什（Ilvaash）为神的脑食人怪狂热者已经开始他们的仪式，而直接位于城镇下方的远境（Far Realm）裂缝加速了镇民的转变。上一章开始时开始转变的四名居民——加拉艾尔修女（Sister Garaele）、安德尔（Ander）、哈莉亚·索顿（Halia Thornton）和命运之轮（Wheel-of-Fortune）——经历了极端的变化。他们被锁在家中以保护自己和他人。来自朋友的定期谨慎访问使这四个人勉强保持理智，因此没有发生进一步的暴力事件。",

Others have sprouted eyes in strange places or experienced other aberrant changes.": "其他居民也显示出转变的迹象。一些人在心不在焉时有一种令人不安的倾向，会用深言语（(Deep Speech)）胡言乱语地谈论“即将到来的崛起”。另一些人在奇怪的地方长出了眼睛，或者经历了其他异常的变化。",
	"The town's buildings seem oddly askew, as though their once-solid construction were deteriorating. This effect is due to a warping in space, so the buildings aren't actually at risk of collapse.": "这个镇的建筑物看起来有些奇怪地倾斜，仿佛它们曾经坚固的结构正在恶化。这种效果是由于空间扭曲造成的，因此这些建筑实际上并不会面临倒塌的风险。",

	"The characters can create their own musical echoes here by playing an instrument or singing, but they risk a bad performance taking on malevolent life. A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma ({@skill Performance}) check causes any existing shadows to wink out and new shadows to replace them and repeat the tune for {@dice 2d4} days. On a failed check, the shadows solidify and become malevolent, taking the form of {@dice 1d4 + 1} {@creature Wraith||wraiths} that attack anyone they can catch. These wraiths automatically fail Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks to hide, as they continually emit jarring music.": "角色可以通过演奏乐器或唱歌在这里创造自己的音乐回声，但他们冒着表现不佳的风险，让邪恶力量附身。成功通过 DC 13 魅力检定的角色会让任何现有的阴影消失，并被新的阴影取代，重复演奏旋律 {@dice 2d4} 天。如果检定失败，这些阴影会凝实并变得邪恶，化为 {@dice 1d4 + 1} {@creature Wraith||wraiths} 的形态，袭击任何他们能抓住的人。这些幽灵会自动失败敏捷检定，因为它们不断发出刺耳的音乐。",

	"A thick, translucent membrane stretches across an opening in one wall, holding back fluid. The fluid on the membrane's other side presses it outward like an infected eardrum, making the membrane thicker in some places and thinner in others.": "一层厚厚的半透明膜伸展在一面墙上的一个开口上，阻挡着流体。膜的另一侧的流体将其向外推，就像感染了的耳膜一样，使膜在某些地方变厚，在另一些地方变薄。",
	"The Nematode's mouth remains closed until the pressure of it brain fluid is released. Once the fluid is released, the Nematode opens its mouth and doesn't close it again for weeks.": "线虫的嘴一直保持关闭，直到它的脑脊液释放出压力。一旦液体释放出来，线虫就会张开嘴巴，并在接下来的几周内不再关闭。",
	"The membrane has AC 10; 80 hit points; and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage. When the membrane is reduced to 0 hit points, it tears open with a violent shudder. The Nematode reacts with regurgitation. This forces its digestive juices upward and into its mouth, which opens.": "这个膜有AC 10；80点生命值；并且免疫钝击、毒素和精神伤害。当这个膜的生命值降低到0点时，它会猛烈颤抖地撕裂开。线虫会做出反应，进行反胃。这会迫使它的消化液向上流动，进入张开的口中。",
	"When the membrane is destroyed, each creature inside the Nematode must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw as the acidic digestive juices surge throughout the Nematode, taking 66 ({@dice 12d10}) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points from this acid damage is completely dissolved.": "当膜被破坏时，线虫内的每个生物必须进行一次 DC 18 的体质豁免检定，因为酸性消化液在线虫内涌动，未通过检定的生物会受到 66 ({@dice 12d10}) 点酸性伤害，通过检定的生物受到一半伤害。受到这种酸性伤害使生物的生命值降至 0 点的话，生物将完全溶解。",
	"Controlling the fluid's release more carefully requires the following steps:": "更仔细地控制流体的释放需要以下步骤：",
	"A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) or Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check realizes that destroying the membrane entirely would force the creature to open its mouth but would also trigger a dangerous physical reaction. Releasing the fluid through a small hole in the proper place causes the creature to open its mouth without triggering regurgitation.": "一个角色成功通过一次DC 10的感知({@skill Medicine})或智力({@skill Nature})检定后意识到，完全破坏这层膜会迫使生物张开嘴巴，但也会引发危险的生理反应。通过在正确位置的小孔释放液体可以让生物张开嘴巴而不触发呕吐反应。",
	"Locating the proper place on the membrane that is neither too thick to puncture nor thin enough to tear requires a successful DC 16 Wisdom ({@skill Medicine} or {@skill Perception}) check.": "在薄膜上找到既不太厚以刺穿也不太薄以撕裂的合适位置，需要进行一次成功的感知检定 DC 16 智力检定（{@skill Medicine} 或 {@skill Perception}）。",
	"Track all the damage characters deal to the membrane, deducting it from the membrane's total hit points. At least 10 points of piercing damage applied to a proper place causes the membrane to relax and the Nematode's mouth to open. Otherwise, the membrane is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points, with the consequences described previously.": "跟踪角色对膜造成的所有伤害，从膜的总生命值中扣除。至少对膜的一个正确位置造成10点穿刺伤害会导致膜放松，线虫的嘴巴打开。否则，当膜的生命值降至0时，膜被摧毁，后果如前所述。",
	"The passage through the creature drops off suddenly into a lake of churning acid.": "生物体的通道突然消失在一个翻滚的酸湖中。",
	"The throat ends at a digestion pool 30 feet in diameter and 20 feet deep. If the characters destroyed the membrane and caused the Nematode to disgorge digestive acid, the pool is only 10 feet deep. Muscular contraction keeps other exits from the digestion pool closed until the Nematode rouses from its inert state.": "喉咙尽头是一个直径30英尺、深20英尺的消化池。如果角色们破坏了膜并导致线虫呕吐消化酸，那么池子只有10英尺深。肌肉收缩会保持其他出口关闭，直到线虫从其惰性状态中苏醒。",
	"Any creature that enters the digestion pool for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there takes 33 ({@dice 6d10}) acid damage. Increase the damage to 99 ({@dice 18d10}) acid damage if the creature is fully immersed in the pool. A creature reduced to 0 hit points from this acid damage is completely dissolved.": "任何生物在自己的回合第一次进入消化池或者在那里开始回合时，会受到33 ({@dice 6d10}) 点酸性伤害。如果生物完全浸泡在池中，将伤害增加至99 ({@dice 18d10}) 点酸性伤害。受到这种酸性伤害使生物生命值降至0的话，生物会完全溶解。",
	"This location is presented on map 8.6.": "这个位置显示在地图8.6上。",
	"A roiling, roughly spherical, yellow-green cloud tumbles through the void.": "一团翻滚的、粗略球形的、黄绿色的云团在虚空中翻滚。",
	"The poisonous fog is a permanent {@spell cloudkill} effect that's 200 feet in diameter and can't be dispersed by wind. The fog conceals a small nodule made of dirt, only 25 feet across, at its center. A smooth, flat ribbon of metal about a foot long is the only thing on the nodule. The metal is bumpy on one side and smooth on the bottom, resembling an oversized human tongue (see below). If a character casts {@spell detect magic} within 30 feet of the tongue, the tongue gives off an abjuration aura.": "这种有毒的雾气是一个直径为200英尺的永久性{@spell cloudkill}效应，不会被风吹散。雾气掩盖着一个直径仅为25英尺的由泥土制成的小结节，位于其中心。结节上唯一的东西是一根约一英尺长的光滑扁平金属带。金属带一侧凹凸不平，底部光滑，形似超大人类舌头(见下图)。如果角色在舌头附近30英尺内施放{@spell detect magic}，舌头会散发出一种遏制光环。",
	"Three {@creature Invisible Stalker||invisible stalkers} lurk in the fog. The mind flayer fanatics summoned the stalkers to watch over the metal tongue. The invisible stalkers don't have any special way to see through the fog and simply fly through it in irregular patrols. They're immediately aware if anyone touches the tongue.": "三个{@creature Invisible Stalker||invisible stalkers}潜伏在雾中。思维吸食者狂热信徒召唤了这些潜伏者来守护那块金属舌头。这些隐形潜伏者没有特殊的方式来看穿雾气，只是不规律地飞行巡逻。他们会立刻察觉到有人触碰到那块舌头。",
	"The metal tongue belongs to the Toppled Statue nodule (see below). The tongue is about 1 foot long and half as wide. It was inside the statue's mouth and functioned as a lever to access a secret room in the statue's base, but the mind flayer fanatics broke off the tongue to trap prisoners from Phandalin in the statue. The fanatics hid the tongue in the Occluding Miasma's fog.": "这块金属舌头属于倾覆雕像结节（见下文）。这块舌头大约有1英尺长，宽度一半。它原本位于雕像的嘴里，作为一个杠杆，用来进入雕像底座的秘密房间，但是脑食人怪狂热者折断了舌头，用来困住从范达林来的囚犯。狂热者把舌头藏在遮蔽瘴气的雾中。",
	"Anyone who takes the tongue becomes the invisible stalkers' quarry. The invisible stalkers attack intruders and pursue thieves, droning, \"The tongue must remain hidden,\" in Auran while they do. They fight until destroyed.": "任何拿走舌头的人都会成为隐形追猎者的猎物。这些隐形追猎者会攻击入侵者，追捕小偷，边攻击边用风语说着“舌头必须保密”。它们会战斗直到被摧毁。",
	"This location is presented on map 8.7.": "这个位置显示在地图8.7上。",
	"This metal statue, once eighty feet tall, has fallen from its large, cube-shaped metal base. The statue depicts a robed mind flayer with a humanlike grin just visible beneath its facial tentacles. A faint hammering emanates from the statue's metal base.": "这座金属雕像曾经有八十英尺高，已经从它巨大的、立方形的金属基座上倒下。雕像描绘了一个穿着长袍的思维吸食者，其面部触手下露出一丝类似人类微笑的表情。从雕像的金属基座中传来微弱的敲击声。",
	"This statue depicts Ablinash, a mind flayer zealot of Ilsensine who forsook its deity to swear obeisance to the discarded divine meninges that became Ilvaash. Ablinash was thus Ilvaash's first follower.": "这座雕像描绘了阿布林纳什(Ablinash)，一个背弃了它的神而向成为伊尔瓦什(Ilvaash)的废弃神经膜宣誓效忠的伊尔森辛(Ilsensine)的掠心者。阿布林纳什因此成为了伊尔瓦什的第一个追随者。",
	"Ablinash possessed an unusual mutation: its mouth was that of a human instead of a mind flayer. Ablinash had facial tentacles like other mind flayers, allowing it to extract brains, but it could consume brains only by messily chewing them. It loved licking brain matter off its even, white teeth. Ablinash believed the meninges was the tastiest and most significant part of the brain, which is why it dedicated itself to the nascent godlet Ilvaash.": "阿布利纳什（Ablinash）拥有一种不同寻常的变异：它的嘴是人类的，而不是控脑怪（mind flayer）的。阿布利纳什像其他控脑怪一样有面部触手，可以提取大脑，但只能通过凌乱地咀嚼来消化大脑。它喜欢用舌头舔干净大脑物质，从它那均匀洁白的牙齿上。阿布利纳什相信脑膜是大脑中最美味和最重要的部分，这就是为什么它将自己奉献给新生的小神（godlet）伊尔瓦什（Ilvaash）。",
	"Later, cultists erected this statue and built the metal base to support it. The only adornment on the base is a 4-foot-wide, humanlike grin affixed to one side to represent Ablinash's mutation. The base's grin has no face around it, just bare metal.": "后来，邪教徒们竖起了这座雕像，并建造了金属底座来支撑它。底座上唯一的装饰是一个4英尺宽的类人笑容，固定在一侧，代表着阿布利纳什(Ablinash)的变异。底座上的笑容周围没有脸，只是光秃秃的金属。",
	"The cultists constructed a secret room in the statue's base. The only way to access it was to manipulate the tongue in the statue's mouth like a lever. Doing so caused the matching grin on the base to open.": "邪教徒在雕像底座中建造了一个秘密房间。唯一进入的方法是操纵雕像嘴里的舌头，就像操作一个杠杆一样。这样做会导致底座上的相应笑容打开。",
	"Many years ago, the heavy statue toppled. One foot remained affixed to the base, distorting the metal when the statue fell. The top of the head is lodged in the hard, fleshy material of the nodule.": "许多年前，沉重的雕像倒塌了。一只脚仍然固定在基座上，在雕像倒下时扭曲了金属。头顶被卡在结节的坚硬、肉质材料中。",
	"If the characters have seen the large metal tongue hidden in the Occluding Miasma, it's clear to them that the tongue is the proper size and shape to fit in this statue. When the characters attempt to reattach the tongue, it snaps into place.": "如果角色们看到了隐藏在遮蔽瘴气中的大金属舌头，他们会清楚地意识到这个舌头的大小和形状适合这座雕像。当角色们试图重新安装舌头时，它会轻轻地卡入位置。",
	"The statue's base has only one adornment and a single opening. The wide grin affixed to the metal on one side doesn't move except by manipulating the missing tongue-lever in the statue.": "这座雕像的底座只有一个装饰和一个开口。金属上的宽笑只固定在一侧，除非通过操纵雕像中缺失的舌杠来移动。",
	"The metal is twisted near the statue's foot, creating an inch-wide tear several feet deep. This space ensures the interior of the cube gets air but is much too small to pass through (except by characters in gaseous or liquid form).": "在雕像脚附近，金属被扭曲，形成了一个宽一英寸、深数英尺的撕裂。这个空间确保了立方体内部能够通风，但太小了，除非是以气体或液体形式的角色，否则无法通过。",
	"The mind flayer fanatics realized the base would make an ideal prison for their most valuable human captives. They used the lever in the statue to open the mouth, ushered their prisoners inside, then closed the mouth. They then broke off the lever and hid it in the Occluding Miasma, under guard, until they could return for it.": "心灵吞噬者狂热者意识到这个基地将是他们最有价值的人类俘虏的理想监狱。他们利用雕像上的杠杆打开嘴巴，把俘虏们带进去，然后关闭嘴巴。然后他们折断了杠杆，将其藏在阻隔瘴气中，并派人看守，直到他们返回取回。",
	"The hammering comes from the captives inside the base signaling for help. They are desperate to get free but lack any means of escape.": "锤子声来自基地内的俘虏，发出求救信号。他们渴望获得自由，但却缺乏任何逃脱的手段。",
	"The four townspeople are all {@creature Commoner||commoners} with an Intelligence of 16: a pair of human clerks named Hovnar Tartesh and Menvin Tartesh, a dwarf named Nalpina Goldstone who is a traveling inventor, and an orc farmer named Mildra Merkel. They haven't eaten in many days and are nearly overcome with hunger and dread. Hovnar has tried to rally the group, mostly to support his brother Menvin, who is nearly comatose with despair.": "这四位镇民都是智力16的{@creature Commoner||commoners}：一对名叫霍夫纳·塔特什 (Hovnar Tartesh) 和门文·塔特什 (Menvin Tartesh) 的人类职员，一位名叫纳尔皮娜·戈德斯通 (Nalpina Goldstone) 的矮人旅行发明家，以及一位名叫米尔德拉·默克尔 (Mildra Merkel) 的半兽人农民。他们已经好几天没吃东西了，几乎被饥饿和恐惧所压倒。霍夫纳试图鼓舞团队，主要是为了支持他那陷入绝望的兄弟门文。",
	"The townspeople can share the following information, shouting through the tiny opening atop the base if necessary:": "镇民可以分享以下信息，必要时可以通过基座顶部的小开口大声喊出：",
	"The mind flayers intend to use the captives' brains to create something called a \"new elder brain\" when they complete their ritual. They're performing this ritual on some other nodule they call \"Ilvaash's Anima.\"": "触须怪意图利用俘虏的大脑来创造一种被称为“新老者脑”(new elder brain)的东西，当他们完成仪式时。他们正在某个被称为“伊尔瓦什之魂”(Ilvaash's Anima)的结节上执行这个仪式。",
	"The mind flayers used the tongue inside the statue's mouth to open the statue's base. The mind flayers then left, used the lever to close the base, and broke off the tongue, trapping the townspeople inside.": "触手食人魔使用雕像嘴里的舌头打开雕像的底座。然后触手食人魔离开，用杠杆关闭底座，并折断舌头，困住了镇民。",
	"Nalpina speaks some Deep Speech, and she heard the mind flayers talk about \"hiding the tongue in the poison cloud.\" Nalpina saw the mind flayers use the statue's tongue as a lever to open the statue's mouth. The mind flayers then broke off the tongue, but Nalpina doesn't know where it is.": "Nalpina会说一些深语，她听到食脑怪谈论“在毒云中隐藏舌头”。Nalpina看到食脑怪使用雕像的舌头作为杠杆打开雕像的嘴。食脑怪随后折断了舌头，但Nalpina不知道它在哪里。",
	"This location is presented on map 8.8.": "这个地点显示在地图8.8上。",
	"Crumbled remnants of an old battlefield cover the top and sides of this massive nodule. Smoke drifts across the battlefield, and a broken pyramid rises above the smoke. A blackened windmill with slowly turning blades keeps the smoke away. A pervasive wailing emanates from the battlefield.": "这个巨大的结节的顶部和侧面覆盖着一个古老战场的残骸。烟雾在战场上飘荡，一个破损的金字塔耸立在烟雾之上。一个黑色的风车带着缓慢转动的叶片将烟雾吹散。一阵阵哀嚎声从战场上传来。",
	"The sulfurous smoke that moves across the battlefield never dissipates. It lightly obscures the details of the buildings and the denizens within them. The wails of soldiers in pain can be heard everywhere on the battlefield, but they have no source.": "战场上弥漫的硫磺烟永不消散。它轻轻地遮掩了建筑物和其中居民的细节。到处都能听到士兵痛苦的哀鸣，但却找不到声音的来源。",

	"Against {@creature Nellik|PaBTSO}'s wishes, these mezzoloths assaulted the Mire of Doubt and fled when the nagas killed one of their number. They know {@creature Nellik|PaBTSO} will be furious at the loss, so they freed the umber hulk trapped here and are trying to disguise it as their lost companion.

The umber hulk is just glad to have survived its interminable stasis.": "违背{@creature Nellik|PaBTSO}的意愿，这些梅佐洛斯袭击了疑惧泽，当那些那伽杀死其中一员后便逃走了。他们知道{@creature Nellik|PaBTSO}会对这次损失感到愤怒，所以他们释放了被困在这里的土色巨蟹，并试图将其伪装成他们失去的同伴。这只土色巨蟹比梅佐洛斯高出几英尺，少了两只手臂，颜色也较浅，但梅佐洛斯们却绝望地这么做。土色巨蟹只是庆幸自己幸存于无尽的停滞之中。",
	"If the characters realize what's going on and share that they killed {@creature Nellik|PaBTSO}, the mezzoloths scatter, visibly relieved. Otherwise, the mezzoloths attack.

She recognizes the characters' arrival as a problem and tries to delay them with conversation to draw out more information. She's interested in discovering whether the characters have brought the other fragments with them. If so, she demands the characters turn them over in exchange for a high position in the \"Empire of the Mind\" that the fanatics are creating in Ilvaash's name. She attacks to acquire the fragments, if necessary. Even if the characters deal peaceably with her, {@creature Chishinix|PaBTSO} isn't likely to suffer their presence for long.

	"The fanatics don't need to rest while performing the lengthy ritual, but they still need to eat. Prior to starting the ritual, they prepared for their needs by installing these metal tubes. When a tube is touched, it produces a fresh Humanoid brain from an extraplanar repository. The brain slowly squelches from the tube and, if not caught, plops onto the ground. Each tube can produce a maximum of one brain per hour.": "狂热者在进行漫长的仪式时不需要休息，但他们仍然需要进食。在开始仪式之前，他们通过安装这些金属管来准备他们的需求。当触摸到管子时，它会从外部位面的存储库中产生一个新鲜的类人脑。大脑会缓慢地从管子中挤出，如果没有被接住，就会掉在地上。每个管子每小时最多可以产生一个大脑。",

	"When the obelisk would take damage, the nearest fanatic instead takes the damage. If the characters retrieved one or more obelisk fragments during {@adventure chapter 6|PaBTSO|6}, the fanatic takes twice as much damage as the obelisk.

	"The true scope of the danger dawns as the morning light illuminates the Nematode writhing 500 feet above the town like a malevolent cloud.

	"This time, the Nematode's interior is populated with eel-like young spawned in its digestive juices (use the {@creature behir} stat block, but they exhale acid rather than lightning).

	"The characters can quell these attacks only by finding and draining the Shallows of Sudden Thought, a miles-wide dead lake similar to the {@area Briny Pool|429|x} in chapter 8. There, a {@creature kraken} named Ghaluzesh directs the attacks against the characters. Ghaluzesh is invulnerable while swimming in the waters of the Shallows of Sudden Thought, but once the characters drain the Shallows, they can take the fight to the kraken. While exploring the Shallows, the characters learn that Ghaluzesh keeps the brain breakers focused on their tasks because the brain breakers fall to fractious infighting without firm leadership.": "角色们只能通过找到并排干突然思绪之浅（与第8章中的{@area Briny Pool|429|x}相似的一个宽阔死湖）来制止这些攻击。在那里，一位名叫Ghaluzesh的{@creature kraken}指挥着对角色们的攻击。在浅思湖的水中游泳时，Ghaluzesh是无敌的，但一旦角色们排干了浅思湖，他们就可以与海怪展开战斗。在探索浅思湖时，角色们得知Ghaluzesh让脑破坏者专注于任务，因为没有坚定的领导，脑破坏者会陷入内讧。",
