	"Ever jealous of the cheery dispositions and colorful deliciousness of the NERDS, Emo the beholder and his hired muscle, Mr. Greystone, have struck a blow against the NERDS' beloved city of Harmony. After years of searching, the nefarious duo have found the sacred Prismatic Well that gives Harmony its vibrant and fabulous colors. Now, with access to the Prismatic Well, Emo and Mr. Greystone have begun to leech the color from the city of Harmony. If they aren't stopped, the city will gradually turn gray, with everything eventually becoming black and white.": "Emo和他的雇佣兵Greystone先生一直嫉妒NERDS的快乐性格和多彩的美味，他们对NERDS所热爱的城市Harmony进行了打击。经过多年的搜寻，这对邪恶的二人组已经找到了神圣的棱镜井，它赋予了和谐城鲜艳而美妙的色彩。现在，有了进入棱镜井的机会，埃莫和格雷斯通先生开始从和谐城中吸取颜色。如果不阻止他们，这个城市将逐渐变成灰色，所有东西最终都会变成黑色和白色。",
	"To the NERDS, the colors beginning to flicker and drain out of Harmony is an unsettling mystery. What brings the colors to Harmony is an enigma to them. All they can do is hope the power comes back on and restores the vibrancy of Harmony's colors once more. But one group knows what's up, and that group is the Lorekeeper Society—a secret society sworn to protect Harmony. The Lorekeepers know about the power of the Prismatic Well, but its true location is lost even to themselves. However, they have a way to find the well using an ancient artifact known as the Amulet of Harmony, but to activate it they need to find the six Gems of Power. Once activated, the amulet guides whoever controls it to the secret location of the Prismatic Well. But once activated, the amulet also has the power to turn off the well.": "对于NERDS来说，颜色开始闪烁并从Harmony中流失是一个令人不安的谜。是什么给和谐号带来了色彩，对他们来说是个谜。他们所能做的就是希望电力恢复，再次恢复和谐号的色彩活力。但有一个团体知道这是怎么回事，这个团体就是传说守护者协会--一个发誓要保护和谐的秘密团体。传说守护者知道棱镜井的力量，但它的真实位置连他们自己都不知道。然而，他们有办法通过一个被称为 \"和谐护身符 \"的古老神器来找到这口井，但要激活它，他们需要找到六颗力量宝石。一旦激活，护身符会引导控制它的人到达棱镜井的秘密地点。但一旦激活，护身符也有能力关闭水井。",

No one in the Lorekeeper Society knows the details of the magical beasts and traps guarding the gems, but our heroic NERDS are more than up to the challenge of restoring Harmony!": "力量宝石很久以前就被藏在地牢、森林和塔楼里保管起来了。守望者协会中没有人知道守护宝石的魔兽和陷阱的细节，但我们英勇的NERDS足以应对恢复和谐的挑战!",
	"Due to the solo player nature of the adventures (with the exception of Adventure 7 Adventure Together), the power level of some monsters may be difficult with respect to the level of the character. You may want to present a roleplaying solution (such as making friends with the monster or tricking them) to players who are eager to rush into combat. With any encounter in this or subsequent adventures, feel free to present opportunities for unconventional solutions and alternatives to combat.": "由于冒险的单人性质（《冒险7》《一起冒险》除外），一些怪物的力量等级可能与角色的等级有一定的差距。你可能想向那些急于投入战斗的玩家提出一个角色扮演的解决方案（如与怪物交朋友或欺骗它们）。在这次或以后的冒险中遇到的任何情况，都可以自由地提出非常规的解决方案和战斗的替代方案的机会。",
	"You can also adjust the story to be more benevolent in nature, allowing automatic successes on rolls, having monsters become instant friends, or giving your player advantage on all their rolls.": "你也可以把故事调整得更仁慈一些，允许卷轴自动成功，让怪物立即成为朋友，或者让你的玩家在所有的卷轴上获得优势。",
	"In the case of an untimely death, you can have a helpful NPC (like Mr. Honeycutt) save the day and revive them, or you can have them forego death saving throws and wake up as they're being dragged someplace unpleasant.": "在意外死亡的情况下，你可以让一个有帮助的NPC（如Honeycutt先生）拯救他们并使他们复活，或者你可以让他们放弃死亡储蓄，在他们被拖到某个不愉快的地方时醒过来。",

Many spend their days reading thick tomes filled with ancient knowledge, while others work with the community to inspire a sense of togetherness.": "灵感修道院的教士们正在为整个和谐地区发生的断色事件寻找答案。许多人整天都在阅读充满古老知识的厚重书籍，而其他人则与社区一起工作，以激发人们的团结意识。",
	"Today, you are sitting near a fountain pondering the mystery of the color outages when you see a bee floundering in the water about to drown. You remember a saying from your elder at the monastery that all living things, no matter how small or if they cause you fear, are to be spared, as such is the way of the order.": "今天，你坐在喷泉边上，思考着颜色中断的奥秘，这时你看到一只蜜蜂在水中挣扎着要淹死。你记得你在修道院的长老说过的一句话：所有的生物，不管它们有多小，也不管它们是否会引起你的恐惧，都应该被放过，因为这就是修行的方式。",
	"If Yellow saves the bee, they gain an unlikely ally later in the adventure.": "如果Yellow救了这只蜜蜂，他们就会在以后的冒险中获得一个不太可能的盟友。",
	"After the encounter with the bee, read the following:": "在与蜜蜂相遇后，阅读以下内容。",

	"I belong to a secret order that has sworn to protect Harmony. These color outages are being caused by a nefarious force that is still unknown to us, but we need your help to recover an item that will aid us in rooting out the evil. The item is called the Saffron Gem. It's been lost for some time, but my recent studies have me almost certain of its location. Can you help us recover it?": "我属于一个发誓要保护和谐的秘密组织。这些颜色的中断是由一个我们还不知道的邪恶力量造成的，但我们需要你的帮助来恢复一个物品，以帮助我们根除这个邪恶。这个物品被称为红花宝石。它已经丢失了一段时间，但我最近的研究让我几乎确定了它的位置。你能帮助我们找回它吗？",
	"Mr. Honeycutt gives Yellow an old map that highlights a location deep within Darkwood Forest. There is a cryptic note written on the map: \"Follow the sweetness.\"": "汉尼卡特先生给了黄一张旧地图，上面标明了黑木森林深处的一个地点。地图上写着一个神秘的说明。\"跟着甜蜜走\"。",

	"The Temple of Miel was once a sanctuary dedicated to the worship of bees. When Yellow reaches the temple, read or paraphrase the following:": "米尔神庙曾经是一个专门用于崇拜蜜蜂的圣地。当小黄到达神庙时，阅读或解说以下内容。",

	"If Yellow goes into the well, they are met with a host of unhappy bees (use the swarm of insects stat block), unless Yellow assisted the bee in the garden, in which case, the bees allow them to pass. If Yellow did not save the bee earlier in the adventure, then the swarm harasses Yellow, who must fight or distract them. Allow for creative problem-solving here, like building a giant flower or smoking the bees into sleepy docility.": "如果黄进入井中，他们会遇到一群不高兴的蜜蜂（使用昆虫群状态块），除非黄在花园中协助蜜蜂，在这种情况下，蜜蜂会允许他们通过。如果黄在冒险过程中没有早点救出蜜蜂，那么蜂群就会骚扰黄，黄必须与它们战斗或引开它们。在这里允许创造性地解决问题，比如建造一朵巨大的花或者把蜜蜂熏得昏昏欲睡。",
	"Once the bees are dealt with, Yellow can climb down the well or use the rope and bucket to lower themselves down. Yellow must succeed on a DC 12 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check or fall into the honey-sweetened water. If Yellow is covered with the honeyed water, the bees follow Yellow for the rest of the adventure, giving them disadvantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks.": "一旦解决了蜜蜂，黄可以爬下井，或者用绳子和桶把自己放下去。黄必须在DC12力量（{@skill Athletics}）检查中成功，否则就会掉进蜜糖水里。如果黄被蜜糖水覆盖，蜜蜂会在剩下的冒险过程中跟随黄，使它们在灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查中处于不利地位。",
	"Just above the waterline, Yellow sees an opening in the side of the well—a small 5-foot-wide corridor (see area T1 on the map below).": "就在水线以上，黄看到井的一侧有一个开口--一个5英尺宽的小走廊（见下图中的T1区）。",
	"Area T2 is the nest of a giant spider. Make sure that your player does not have arachnophobia (a deep fear of spiders) before moving on with the following scene. If your player isn't comfortable with spiders, area T2 is instead guarded by a skeleton and area T1 is filled with bones instead of spiderwebs.": "T2区是一只大蜘蛛的巢穴。在继续下面的场景之前，请确保你的玩家没有蜘蛛恐惧症（对蜘蛛的深度恐惧）。如果你的玩家对蜘蛛不感冒，那么T2区将由一个骷髅看守，T1区则充满了骨头而不是蜘蛛网。",
	"If Yellow enters the narrow tunnel that leads from the well to area T2, they see that the tunnel is filled with an increasingly thick network of spiderwebs that crisscrosses the area. To reach area T2, Yellow must pick their way carefully through the webs.": "如果Yellow进入从水井通往T2区的狭窄隧道，他们会发现隧道里布满了越来越厚的蜘蛛网，纵横交错。为了到达T2区，Yellow必须小心翼翼地穿过这些蜘蛛网。",
	"When Yellow enters this room, read or paraphrase the following:": "当黄晓明进入这个房间时，阅读或转述以下内容。",

Large chunks of beehive hang from the walls, and honey drips from the combs.": "这个房间的形状像一个巨大的蜂巢，上面布满了蜂巢和蜘蛛网。墙壁上雕刻着六边形的图案，向上弯曲到头顶40英尺高的圆顶。大块的蜂巢挂在墙上，蜂蜜从蜂巢中滴落下来。",
	"On the floor, under a dense mat of spiderwebs, there's a chest atop a 4-foot-tall stone plinth.": "在地板上，在密密麻麻的蜘蛛网下，有一个箱子在一个4英尺高的石基上。",
	"This is the lair of {@creature Szikzith|NRH-AWoL}, an awakened giant wolf spider. {@creature Szikzith|NRH-AWoL} is greedy and scheming and has developed a taste for honey. She wants all the honey she can get—but she's eaten so much of the delicious honey that there's no more within the beehive room and she has become too fat to escape through the small tunnel.": "这里是{@creature Szikzith|NRH-AWoL}的巢穴，一只觉醒的巨狼蜘蛛。{@creature Szikzith|NRH-AWoL}贪婪而诡计多端，已经养成了对蜂蜜的喜好。她想得到所有她能得到的蜂蜜--但她已经吃了很多美味的蜂蜜，以至于蜂房内没有更多的蜂蜜，她已经变得太胖了，无法通过小通道逃走。",
	"{@creature Szikzith|NRH-AWoL} guards her lair, and if she finds out that there's something Yellow wants—like the chest—she demands that they bring honey to her. {@creature Szikzith|NRH-AWoL} is not very smart, so she can be tricked with a successful DC 13 Intelligence ({@skill Deception}) check. {@creature Szikzith|NRH-AWoL} is also not above going back on a deal and demanding more honey if she feels like she can intimidate Yellow into getting more. Reward your player for good roleplaying here.": "{@creature Szikzith|NRH-AWoL}守卫着她的巢穴，如果她发现有黄种人想要的东西--比如箱子--她会要求他们把蜂蜜带给她。{@creature Szikzith|NRH-AWoL}不是很聪明，所以只要成功通过DC13智力（{@skill Deception}）检查就可以骗过她。{@creature Szikzith|NRH-AWoL}也不排除在交易中反悔，并要求更多的蜂蜜，如果她觉得她可以恐吓黄来获得更多的蜂蜜。奖励你的玩家在这里进行良好的角色扮演。",
	"Honey can be found around the temple ruins, but obtaining it can be tricky. Yellow must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check to get some honey without getting attacked by bees (use the {@creature swarm of insects} stat block). If your player comes up with a clever plan for getting the honey, then allow them to roll with advantage or automatically succeed. Good roleplaying is always rewarded!": "在神庙废墟周围可以找到蜂蜜，但获得它可能很棘手。黄必须在DC15智力（{@skill Nature}）检查中成功获得一些蜂蜜而不被蜜蜂攻击（使用{@creature swarm of insects}状态块）。如果你的玩家想出了一个聪明的计划来获取蜂蜜，那么就允许他们用优势卷或者自动成功。好的角色扮演总是会得到回报的。",
	"Getting the Saffron Gem Once {@creature Szikzith|NRH-AWoL} is dealt with, Yellow must cut through the webs to uncover a locked chest that's beautifully decorated with bee and flower motifs. There's a riddle written on the lid of the chest: \"I'm a comb but not for hair.\"": "获得红花宝石 一旦解决了{@creature Szikzith|NRH-AWoL}的问题，Yellow必须剪开网，揭开一个上了锁的箱子，箱子上有漂亮的蜜蜂和花朵的图案装饰。箱子的盖子上写着一个谜语。\"我是一把梳子，但不是用来梳头的。\"",
	"The chest has five rotating disks on its side. Each disk is carved with the letters of the alphabet and can be rotated independently of the others to create different letter-alignment combinations. To unlock the chest, the disks must be aligned so the topmost letters spell out \"HONEY.\"": "箱子的侧面有五个旋转盘。每个圆盘上都刻有字母，可以独立于其他圆盘旋转，形成不同的字母排列组合。要解开箱子，必须将圆盘对准，使最上面的字母拼出 \"HONEY\"。",

	"If Yellow returns to the monastery to meet with Mr. Honeycutt and delivers the Saffron Gem as promised, Mr. Honeycutt thanks Yellow profusely. He offers Yellow membership in the Lorekeeper Society and asks if Yellow will help him put an end to those who would \"dare to dull the vibrant soul of Harmony\". Mr. Honeycutt says that he's close to figuring out the culprits behind the color outages and he feels like he's going to need the help of heroes to stop them.": "如果Yellow回到修道院与Honeycutt先生见面并如约交付了红花宝石，Honeycutt先生会对Yellow表示深深的感谢。他为Yellow提供了洛瑞守护者协会的会员资格，并询问Yellow是否会帮助他结束那些 \"敢于使和谐的活力之魂黯淡 \"的人。霍尼卡特先生说，他已经接近弄清颜色中断背后的罪魁祸首，他觉得他将需要英雄们的帮助来阻止他们。",
	"The following magic items appear in this adventure.": "下列魔法物品出现在这次冒险中。",
	"In solo play, there's always a chance the character can die. In the case of a single adventurer, this death results in the end of play; which isn't optimal for an afternoon of fun! One way to avoid death is to have healing readily available to the adventurer. If they're without healing, have the character find the odd {@item potion of healing} lying in a dusty crate or have them discover a special healing plant on their journey that, if eaten, puts them back to full hit points.": "在独自冒险中，角色总是有可能会死亡。对于一个单独的冒险者，死亡会导致游戏结束；这对于一个下午的娱乐来说并不理想！避免死亡的一种方法是让冒险者随时获得治疗。如果他们没有治疗，可以让角色在一只灰尘飘飘的箱子里发现一个奇怪的{@item potion of healing}，或者让他们在旅途中发现一种特殊的治疗植物，如果食用，可以让他们恢复满血。",
	"The man introduces himself as {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}, the Magister of the Lorekeeper Society.

	"On the journey through Darkwood, Yellow has a chance to spot some healing herbs that, if collected and brewed into a tea, can act as a {@item potion of healing}. To find enough herbs to make a single dose of the tea, Yellow must first succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check to find the herbs and then make a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Medicine}) check to brew them into a medicine. There are only enough herbs for one potion.": "在穿越黑木森林的旅途中，小黄有机会发现一些治愈草药，如果收集起来煮成茶，可以起到一个{@item potion of healing}的作用。为了找到足够的草药来制作一剂茶，小黄必须首先成功通过一次 DC 12 智力检定({@skill Nature}) 来找到草药，然后再进行一次 DC 12 智力检定({@skill Medicine}) 来将它们煮成药物。只有足够的草药来制作一瓶药剂。",
	"For every 10 feet Yellow travels through the webs, have them make a DC 13 Dexterity check. On a failure, they touch a web which sends a vibration and alerts {@creature Szikzith|NRH-AWoL} (see area T2). {@creature Szikzith|NRH-AWoL} either waits in ambush or comes down into the tunnel to investigate. On a success, Yellow has surprise.": "当黄色穿过蜘蛛网的每10英尺，让他们进行一次DC 13的敏捷检定。如果失败，他们触碰到一张蜘蛛网，发出振动并警报{@creature Szikzith|NRH-AWoL}（见区域T2）。{@creature Szikzith|NRH-AWoL}要么隐藏伏击，要么下到隧道中调查。如果成功，黄色获得意外性。",
