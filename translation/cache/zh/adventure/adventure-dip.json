	"The adventure is set a short distance from the city of Neverwinter in the Sword Coast region of the Forgotten Realms setting. The Sword Coast is part of the North—a vast realm of free settlements surrounded by lawless, untamed wilderness. You don't need to be a Forgotten Realms expert to run the adventure, as everything you need to know about the setting is contained in this book.": "这场冒险的背景是离永夜城不远的被遗忘国度背景中的剑海岸地区。剑海岸是北方的一部分--一个由自由定居点组成的广阔领域，周围是无法无天的荒野。你不需要成为被遗忘的领域的专家来运行这个冒险，因为你需要知道的关于这个设定的一切都包含在这本书中。",
	"If this is your first time running a D&D adventure, read the \"Role of the Dungeon Master\" section.": "如果这是你第一次进行D&D冒险，请阅读 \"地下城主的角色 \"部分。",
	"The Dungeon Master (also called \"the DM\") has a special role in the D&D game.": "地牢管理员（也称为 \"DM\"）在D&D游戏中具有特殊作用。",
	"The most important thing to remember about being a good DM is that the rules are a tool to help you and the players have fun. The rules aren't in charge. You're the DM—you're in charge of the game.": "要成为一个好的管理人，最重要的一点是，规则是帮助你和玩家获得乐趣的工具。规则并不负责任。你是管理员，你负责游戏。",
	"Who should be the DM for your gaming group? Whoever wants to be! The person who has the most drive to pull a group together and start up a game often ends up being the DM by default, but that doesn't have to be the case.": "谁应该是你的游戏小组的DM？谁想做就做! 最有动力把一个小组拉到一起并开始游戏的人往往最终会被默认为管理员，但情况并不一定是这样。",
	"As the DM, you are the final authority when it comes to rules questions or disputes during the game. Here are some guidelines to help you arbitrate issues as they arise.": "作为管理人，当涉及到游戏中的规则问题或争议时，你是最终的权威。这里有一些准则，可以帮助你在出现问题时进行仲裁。",
	"{@b When in doubt, make it up}. It's better to keep the game moving than to get bogged down in the rules.": "{@b When in doubt, make it up}. 与其在规则上纠缠不清，不如让游戏继续前进。",
	"{@b Embrace the shared story}. D&D is about telling a story as a group, so let the players contribute to the outcome through the words and deeds of their characters. If some players are reluctant to speak up, remember to ask them what their characters are doing.": "{@b Embrace the shared story}. D&D是在讲一个团体的故事，所以让玩家通过他们的角色的言行对结果做出贡献。如果有些玩家不愿意说话，记得问问他们的角色在做什么。",
	"{@b It's not a competition}. The DM isn't competing against the player characters. Your job is to referee the rules, run monsters, and keep the story moving.": "{@b It's not a competition}. 管理员不是在与玩家角色竞争。你的工作是对规则进行裁判，管理怪物，并保持故事的进展。",
	"{@b Be consistent and fair}. If you decide that a rule works a certain way, make sure it works that way the next time it comes into play. Treat the rules and your players in a fair, impartial manner.": "{@b Be consistent and fair}. 如果你决定某条规则以某种方式运作，请确保它在下次出现时以这种方式运作。以公平、公正的方式对待规则和你的球员。",

	"{@b Keep a notepad and some graph paper handy}. Use the notepad to keep track of details such as the characters' marching order. Graph paper will be helpful if you need to draw a quick map for your players.": "{@b Keep a notepad and some graph paper handy}. 用记事本来记录细节，如人物的行军顺序。如果你需要为你的球员画一张快速的地图，石墨纸会有帮助。",
	"The adventure often tells you what ability checks characters might try in a certain situation, and the Difficulty Class (DC) of those checks. Sometimes characters try things that the adventure can't possibly anticipate. You decide whether their attempts are successful.": "冒险通常会告诉你角色在某种情况下可能会尝试哪些能力检查，以及这些检查的难度等级（DC）。有时角色会尝试一些冒险中不可能预料到的事情。你决定他们的尝试是否成功。",
	"Ability checks only come into play if there's a genuine chance of succeeding or failing at the task. If it seems like anyone should have an easy time doing it, don't ask for an ability check. Just tell the player what happens. Conversely, if there's no way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player it doesn't work.": "能力检查只有在任务有真正的成功或失败的机会时才会发挥作用。如果看起来任何人都应该很容易做到这一点，就不要要求进行能力检查。只要告诉玩家会发生什么。相反，如果任何人都不可能完成这个任务，那么就告诉玩家这是不可能的。",
	"If and when you decide that an ability check is required, ask yourself these questions:": "如果以及当你决定需要进行能力检查时，请问自己这些问题。",
	"Use the descriptions of the ability scores and their associated skills in the rulebook to help you decide what kind of ability check to use.": "使用规则手册中对能力分数及其相关技能的描述来帮助你决定使用哪种能力检查。",

	"{@b DC 15 (Moderate}). A moderate task requires a higher level of competence to accomplish. A character with natural aptitude and specialized training can accomplish a moderate task more often than not.": "{@b DC 15 (Moderate}). 一个中等程度的任务需要较高的能力水平来完成。一个具有天赋能力和专门训练的人物可以更经常地完成一个中等程度的任务。",
	"{@b DC 20 (Hard}). Hard tasks include things beyond the capabilities of most people without aid or exceptional ability. Even with aptitude and training, a character needs some amount of luck—or a lot of specialized training—to pull off a hard task.": "{@b DC 20 (Hard}). 艰巨的任务包括在没有援助或特殊能力的情况下超出大多数人的能力的事情。即使有能力和训练，一个角色也需要一定的运气或大量的专门训练来完成一项艰难的任务。",
	"The box containing this adventure includes components designed to help you as the Dungeon Master. In addition to the rulebook, these components are as follows:": "包含这个冒险的盒子里有一些组件，旨在帮助你这个地下城主。除了规则手册之外，这些组件还包括以下内容。",

	"When you're ready to begin the adventure, unfold the poster map so that the map of Phandalin faces up. Here is where the adventure begins. When it comes time for players to embark on quests, use the Sword Coast map on the reverse side to help chart their overland journey.": "当你准备好开始冒险时，展开海报地图，让范达林的地图朝上。这里是冒险开始的地方。当玩家开始做任务的时候，使用反面的剑海岸地图来帮助绘制他们的陆路旅程。",
	"The box contains the following cards:": "盒子里有以下卡片。",
	"{@b Combat Step by Step Cards}. These identical cards outline the order of combat, as described in the rulebook.": "{@b Combat Step by Step Cards}. 这些相同的卡片概述了战斗的顺序，如规则手册中所述。",

A player whose character is suffering from a condition can keep the card as a reminder, giving it back to you when the condition ends for that character.": "{@b Condition Cards}. 这些卡片描述了游戏中可能影响生物的各种状况。角色受到某种状况影响的玩家可以保留这张卡作为提醒，当该角色的状况结束时再把它还给你。",
	"{@b Initiative Cards}. After the characters and each group of monsters involved in a combat roll initiative, distribute these cards among the combat participants, from the highest to lowest initiative count. For example, whoever rolls the highest initiative gets the \"1\" card and acts first, whoever rolls the second highest initiative gets the \"2\" card, and so on. Keep the numbered cards for the creatures you're running.": "{@b Initiative Cards}. 在参与战斗的角色和每组怪物掷出主动权后，将这些卡片在战斗参与者之间分配，从最高到最低的主动权计数。例如，谁掷出的主动权最高，谁就得到 \"1 \"牌并首先行动，谁掷出的主动权第二高，谁就得到 \"2 \"牌，以此类推。为你正在运行的生物保留编号的卡片。",
	"{@b Magic Item Cards}. When the characters acquire a magic item and identify it, give the players the card for that item. Let the player whose character has the item keep the card for reference until the item is expended or no longer in that character's possession.": "{@b Magic Item Cards}. 当角色获得一个魔法物品并识别它时，给玩家该物品的卡片。让拥有该物品的玩家保留该卡片作为参考，直到该物品被消耗或不再由该角色拥有。",

	"{@b Sidekick Cards}. If you're running the game for a single player, give the player these cards and let them choose a sidekick. The sidekick's corresponding stat block can be found in the rulebook. If the sidekick dies, collect the card; the player can't choose that sidekick again.": "{@b Sidekick Cards}. 如果你是为单个玩家进行游戏，给玩家这些牌，让他们选择一个伙伴。伙伴的相应状态块可以在规则手册中找到。如果这个伙伴死了，就把牌收起来；玩家就不能再选择这个伙伴了。",
	"Maps that appear in this book are for the DM's eyes only. A map not only shows an adventure location in its entirety but also shows secret doors, hidden traps, and other elements the players aren't meant to see—hence the need for secrecy.": "本书中出现的地图只供DM观看。地图不仅显示了冒险地点的全貌，而且还显示了秘密的门、隐藏的陷阱和其他玩家不应该看到的元素--因此需要保密性。",
	"When the characters arrive at a location marked on a map, you can either rely on a verbal description to give them a clear mental picture of the location, or you can draw what they see on a piece of graph paper, copying what's on your map while omitting details as appropriate. It's not important that your hand-drawn map perfectly match what's in the printed adventure. Focus on getting the shape and dimensions correct, and leave the rest to the players' imaginations.": "当人物到达地图上标记的地点时，你可以依靠口头描述来让他们对该地点有一个清晰的印象，或者你可以把他们看到的东西画在一张图画纸上，复制地图上的内容，同时适当地省略一些细节。你的手绘地图是否与印刷的冒险书中的内容完全一致并不重要。把重点放在形状和尺寸的正确性上，其余的留给玩家的想象力。",
	"The world of the Forgotten Realms is one of high fantasy, populated by elves, dwarves, halflings, humans, and other folk. In the Realms, knights dare the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate. Clerics in the service of gods wield mace and spell, questing against the terrifying powers that threaten the land. Wizards plunder the ruins of the fallen Netherese empire, delving into secrets too dark for the light of day. Bards sing of kings, queens, heroes, and tyrants who died long ago.": "被遗忘的王国的世界是一个高度幻想的世界，由精灵、矮人、半身人、人类和其他民族居住。在这个王国里，骑士们敢于在德尔祖恩死去的矮人国王的墓穴中寻找荣耀和财宝。盗贼们在Neverwinter和Baldur's Gate等繁华城市的黑暗小巷中游荡。为神灵服务的教士们挥舞着法杖和咒语，寻求对抗威胁土地的可怕力量。巫师们在堕落的尼瑟斯帝国的废墟上进行掠夺，深入探究黑暗的秘密，以获得光明。吟游诗人歌唱国王、女王、英雄和很久以前死去的暴君。",
	"On the roads and rivers of the Realms travel minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers and sailors. Steel-hearted adventurers from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages follow tales of strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can take even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world, but these paths are never safe. Fell magic and deadly monsters are the perils one faces when traveling in the Realms. Even farms and freeholds within a day's walk of a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.": "在王国的道路和河流上，游吟诗人和小贩、商人和卫兵、士兵和水手。来自乡间农庄和沉睡村庄的铁石心肠的冒险家们追寻着奇怪的、光荣的、遥远的地方的故事。好的地图和清晰的小路甚至可以把一个没有经验的青年带向世界的远方，但这些道路从来都不安全。坠落的魔法和致命的怪物是人们在王国中旅行时面临的危险。即使是离城市只有一天路程的农场和土地，也可能成为怪物的猎物，没有一个地方可以避免龙的突然发怒。",
	"The map below shows a region of the Forgotten Realms called the Sword Coast. This is a place of adventure, where daring souls delve into ancient strongholds and explore the ruins of long-lost kingdoms. Amid a lawless wilderness of jagged, snow-capped peaks, alpine forests, bitter winds, and roaming monsters, the coast holds such great bastions of civilization as the city of Neverwinter, in the shadow of the fuming volcano known as Mount Hotenow.": "下面的地图显示了被遗忘的领域中一个叫做 \"剑海岸 \"的地区。这是一个充满冒险的地方，大胆的灵魂在这里深入古老的堡垒，探索久违的王国的废墟。在一片由嶙峋的雪峰、高山森林、凛冽的寒风和游荡的怪物组成的无法无天的荒野中，海岸上有一些伟大的文明堡垒，如永夜城，在被称为霍特诺火山的阴影中。",
	"This map is for the DM's eyes only, as it indicates the locations of places described later in this adventure. A larger, player-friendly version of the map appears on one side of the poster map included with this adventure. The poster map of the Sword Coast can be shared freely with the players as their characters explore the region.": "这张地图仅供管理员参考，因为它标明了本冒险中稍后描述的地方的位置。该地图的一个较大的、适合玩家使用的版本出现在本冒险所附的海报地图的一面。剑海岸的海报地图可以在玩家的角色探索该地区时与他们自由分享。",
	"Geographical locations marked on both the DM's map and the players' map are described below in alphabetical order. This information is not secret, and can be shared with players if they request details about a particular location.": "在DM的地图和玩家的地图上标注的地理位置，按字母顺序描述如下。这些信息并不是秘密，如果玩家要求了解某个特定地点的细节，可以与他们分享。",
	"These rocky, windswept hills are dotted with old mines that have become infested with monsters.": "这些多岩石、多风的山丘上点缀着已被怪物侵袭的旧矿。",
	"This highway hugs the coast, connecting Neverwinter to the coastal cities of Luskan to the north and Waterdeep to the south. For years, the stretch of road south of Neverwinter fell into disuse because of frequent monster attacks. Of late, efforts have been made to keep the road safe, with light patrols of guards on horseback moving between Neverwinter and Leilon.": "这条公路环绕着海岸，将永夜城与北边的卢斯坎和南边的沃特德普等沿海城市连接起来。多年来，由于频繁的怪物袭击，永夜城南部的这段路已经荒废了。最近，人们努力保持道路的安全，由骑马的卫兵组成的轻型巡逻队在永温特和莱隆之间穿梭。",
	"This ancient forest tucked behind the Sword Mountains contains the ruins of bygone dwarven civilizations.": "这座隐藏在剑山后面的古老森林包含了过去的矮人文明的遗迹。",
	"This small town along the High Road is in the midst of rebuilding itself after being abandoned for years. Its inhabitants hail from Neverwinter and are in the paid service of the city's Lord Protector, who has tasked them with turning Leilon into a fortified settlement that can ward off threats from the Mere of Dead Men.": "这个沿着高路的小镇在被遗弃多年后正处于重建之中。它的居民来自永夜城，为该城的保护者大人提供有偿服务，保护者大人责成他们将雷隆变成一个坚固的定居点，以抵御来自死人谷的威胁。",
	"This city was badly damaged when Mount Hotenow erupted some fifty years ago. Now, the City of Skilled Hands works to rebuild under the watchful eye of its Lord Protector, Dagult Neverember, who rules in the absence of an heir to Neverwinter's crown. At present, no legitimate heirs to the old Alagondar royal line are known to exist, and many believe that the line is ended. Lord Neverember, taking no chances, quietly pays off or disposes of anyone claiming a connection to the rulers of old.": "这座城市在大约五十年前霍特诺火山爆发时遭到了严重破坏。现在，\"巧手之城 \"在其保护者达古特-纽文伯的注视下努力重建，他在永夜城王室没有继承人的情况下进行统治。目前，老阿拉贡达王室的合法继承人并不存在，许多人认为这一血统已经结束。Neverember勋爵不抱任何侥幸心理，悄悄地收买或处理任何声称与旧统治者有联系的人。",
	"The forest east of Neverwinter seems to have a magical quality about it, or at least an air of mystical secrecy. Reclusive spellcasters are rumored to dwell deep within.": "永夜城东部的森林似乎有一种神奇的气质，或者至少有一种神秘的气息。据传，隐秘的施法者就居住在森林深处。",
	"This range of rocky knolls is so named because the area has been the impact site of a number of meteor showers over millennia. The hills are haunted by ruthless barbarian tribes, giving others little reason to visit the area.": "这片岩石山丘的范围之所以被命名，是因为该地区在数千年来一直是一些流星雨的撞击地点。这些山丘被无情的野蛮人部落所困扰，使其他人没有理由访问这个地区。",
	"These steep, craggy, snow-capped mountains are home to scattered tribes of orcs as well as other monsters. Icespire Peak is the tallest among them. Their foothills are strewn with the ruins of bygone kingdoms, and more than a few half-forgotten dungeons and tombs.": "这些陡峭的雪山是分散的兽人部落以及其他怪物的家园。冰火峰是其中最高的一座。它们的山麓散布着过去王国的废墟，还有更多半被遗忘的地牢和坟墓。",
	"This path south of Neverwinter Wood is the safest route between Neverwinter and the town of Triboar, located in the Dessarin Valley to the east (off the map). The trail is not patrolled, and monster attacks are commonplace.": "永冬森林南部的这条小路是永冬镇和位于东边的德萨林谷（地图外）的特里波尔镇之间最安全的路线。这条小路没有人巡逻，怪物袭击是常有的事。",
	"Dungeons & Dragons is a game that requires several hours to play, but you can stop the game at any time and continue it later. The first session should focus on character creation—one of the most fun aspects of the game. If the players create and equip their characters with time to spare, you can begin the adventure once they're ready to go. Otherwise, congratulate them on building their characters and begin the adventure with the next session.": "龙与地下城是一个需要几个小时的游戏，但你可以在任何时候停止游戏，以后继续。第一次会议应该集中在创建角色上--这是游戏中最有趣的方面。如果玩家在创建和装备他们的角色时时间充裕，你可以在他们准备好后开始冒险。否则，祝贺他们建立了自己的角色，并在下一次会议上开始冒险。",
	"Each player has options when it comes to choosing a character race, class, and background. These options are summarized in the Character Options table. If there are multiple players in the group, encourage them to choose different classes so that the party has a range of abilities. It's less important that the party include multiple races or backgrounds, as sometimes it's fun to play an all-dwarf party or a troupe of adventuring entertainers.": "在选择角色的种族、等级和背景方面，每个玩家都有一些选择。这些选项在 \"角色选项 \"表中作了总结。如果小组中有多个玩家，鼓励他们选择不同的阶级，以便聚会有一系列的能力。队伍中是否包括多个种族或背景并不重要，因为有时玩一个全矮人的队伍或一个冒险艺人的剧团也很有趣。",
	"While your players follow the steps of character creation as outlined in the rulebook, pay attention to the choices they make. The backgrounds they choose define who their characters were before becoming adventurers, and also include roleplaying hooks in the form of ideals, bonds, and flaws—things that you, as the DM, want to know. For example, if a player chooses the Criminal background, one of the options for the character's bond is, \"I'm trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.\" If that's the character's bond, work with the player to decide who that generous benefactor is.": "当你的玩家按照规则手册中的步骤进行角色创建时，要注意他们的选择。他们选择的背景决定了他们的角色在成为冒险家之前的身份，也包括以理想、纽带和缺陷为形式的角色扮演钩子--这些都是你，作为DM，想要知道的。例如，如果一个玩家选择了犯罪背景，那么角色的纽带选项之一就是：\"我正在努力偿还我欠一位慷慨的恩人的旧债。\" 如果这是该角色的纽带，请与该玩家一起决定谁是那个慷慨的恩人。",
	"If you have two or more players, the easiest way to start the adventure is to assume that the characters know each other and have some sort of history together, however brief that history might be. The characters might have met in Neverwinter and traveled to Phandalin together, or they might have arrived in Phandalin separately and gotten to know each other while staying at the local inn.": "如果你有两个或更多的玩家，开始冒险的最简单方法是假设角色们互相认识，并且有某种共同的历史，不管这段历史有多简短。这些角色可能是在永夜城认识的，然后一起去了潘达林，也可能是分别到达了潘达林，在当地旅馆住下的时候认识了对方。",
	"Here are some questions you can ask the players as they create characters:": "这里有一些问题，你可以在玩家创建角色时问他们。",
	"Are any of the characters related to each other?": "有什么人物是相互关联的吗？",
	"What keeps the characters together as a party?": "是什么让这些人物保持在一起，成为一个政党？",
	"What does each character like most about every other member of the adventuring party?": "每个角色最喜欢冒险队伍中的其他成员的什么？",
	"If you're running this adventure for a single player, you can give that player a sidekick as a secondary character. Let the player choose one of the pregenerated sidekicks from the selection of Sidekick Cards. Rules and stat blocks for sidekicks appear in the rulebook. You might need to help the player run the sidekick for the first few sessions. If a sidekick is lost or no longer needed, the character can return to Phandalin and acquire a new one.": "如果你是为一个玩家进行这个冒险，你可以给这个玩家一个副手作为次要角色。让玩家从副角卡的选择中选择一个预先生成的副角。副角的规则和状态块出现在规则手册中。你可能需要在最初的几节课上帮助玩家管理这个副角。如果跟班丢失或不再需要，角色可以返回范达林并获得一个新的跟班。",
	"Make sure the player understands the roles and limitations of sidekicks in this adventure:": "要确保玩家了解在这次冒险中副手的作用和限制。",
	"Sidekicks are stalwart companions who can perform tasks both in and out of combat, including things such as setting up camp and carrying gear.": "副手是顽强的伙伴，在战斗中和战斗外都能执行任务，包括建立营地和携带装备等。",
	"Ideally, a sidekick's abilities should complement those of the main character. For example, a spellcaster makes a good sidekick for a fighter or rogue.": "理想情况下，跟班的能力应该是对主角的补充。例如，一个施法者可以成为一个战士或流氓的好伙伴。",
	"As the players familiarize themselves with the character options and adventuring gear described in the rulebook, take advantage of the opportunity to read ahead.": "当玩家熟悉了规则手册中描述的角色选项和冒险装备后，要利用机会提前阅读。",
	"\"{@area The Adventure Begins|028|x}\" section tells you everything you need to know about what's happening in and around Phandalin.

	"At various places, the adventure presents descriptive text that's meant to be read or paraphrased aloud to the players. This read-aloud text is offset in boxes. Boxed text is most commonly used to describe locations or present bits of scripted dialogue.": "在不同的地方，冒险中出现了描述性的文字，这些文字是为了让玩家朗读或转述的。这种朗读的文字是用方框来抵消的。盒子里的文字最常用于描述地点或呈现剧本中的对话片段。",
	"Any monster or NPC that is likely to be involved in combat requires game statistics so that the DM can run it effectively. These statistics are presented in a format called a stat block.

	"Driven from lands farther north by more powerful dragons, a {@creature young white dragon} named Cryovain has descended upon the Sword Mountains, claiming the snow-capped range as its domain. Typical of its kind, Cryovain is dim-witted and cruel. The dragon patrols the skies around Icespire Peak, surveying its territory while hunting for food and easy treasure. With each passing day, the dragon's domain grows as it ranges farther across the land, preying on anything it can catch with its claws or freeze to death with its icy breath. Sightings of the dragon are becoming more common, as are its attacks.": "在更强大的龙的驱使下，一个名为Cryovain的{@creature young white dragon}从更北的地方来到了剑山，将这片白雪皑皑的山脉作为自己的领域。作为其同类的典型代表，Cryovain智力低下，而且很残忍。这条龙在冰火峰周围的天空中巡逻，一边监视它的领地，一边猎取食物和容易得到的财宝。随着时间的推移，这条龙的领地越来越大，它的活动范围也越来越广，它可以用爪子抓取任何东西，也可以用冰冷的气息将其冻死。龙的踪迹越来越多，它的攻击也越来越普遍。",
	"The frontier town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, the old Phandalin was a thriving human town whose people were firmly allied with neighboring dwarves and gnomes. Then an orc horde swept through the area and laid waste to the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.": "边境小镇范达林是建立在一个更古老的定居点的废墟上的。几百年前，古老的范达林是一个繁荣的人类城镇，其人民与邻近的矮人和侏儒结成了牢固的联盟。后来，兽人部落横扫该地区，将该定居点夷为平地，范达林被遗弃了几个世纪。",
	"In the last three or four years, settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Phandalin. The new settlement is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. The arrival of a white dragon threatens to destroy all that they've worked to rebuild.": "在过去的三四年里，来自永夜城和水底城的定居者已经开始了开垦潘达林废墟的艰苦工作。新的定居点现在是农民、樵夫、毛皮商人和被剑山山麓的黄金和白金故事吸引的探矿者的家。一条白龙的到来威胁到了他们努力重建的一切。",

	"Icespire Hold is a stone fortress perched on the icy northeast spur of Icespire Peak. A warlord named Delsendra Amzarr built the stronghold, and dwelled there for many years while she and her soldiers kept the orcs of the Sword Mountains in check. When supply lines were cut off by heavy snow and blizzards during a brutal winter, Delsendra and her followers starved to death. Orcs later took over the fortress, which was damaged by an earthquake ten years ago and never repaired.": "冰火之城是一座石制堡垒，坐落在冰火峰的东北侧支脉上。一位名叫戴尔森德拉-阿姆扎尔（Delsendra Amzarr）的军阀建造了这个据点，并在那里居住了很多年，她和她的士兵们一直在控制着剑山的兽人。在一个残酷的冬天，供应线被大雪和暴风雪切断，戴尔森德拉和她的追随者饿死了。兽人后来占领了要塞，要塞在十年前的一次地震中受损，从未修复。",

	"Recently, evil mercenaries calling themselves the Stone-Cold Reavers infiltrated the gatehouse and escaped Cryovain's notice. They assume (incorrectly) that the dragon has amassed a hoard and hidden it in the fortress. The next time the dragon flies off, they plan to steal it. They treat adventurers as they would any other competitors—either trying to scare them off or killing them.": "最近，自称 \"石冷掠夺者 \"的邪恶雇佣兵潜入门楼，躲过了克雷奥文的注意。他们认为（不正确地），龙已经积累了一个囤积物，并把它藏在堡垒里。下次龙飞走的时候，他们打算把它偷走。他们对待冒险者就像对待其他竞争者一样--要么试图吓跑他们，要么杀死他们。",

On a failed saving throw, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and its speed is halved.

These effects end on the creature after it spends at least an hour in a place of warmth.": "白天的温度略高于冰点，晚上则骤降。每当温度达到或低于华氏0度时，暴露在寒冷中的生物必须在每小时结束时做一个DC 10的宪法救赎动作。对寒冷伤害有抵抗力或免疫力的生物，以及穿着寒冷天气装备的生物和自然适应寒冷气候的生物，都会自动成功地进行蓄力。如果救赎失败，该生物在能力检查、攻击卷和救赎方面处于劣势，其速度也会减半。如果该生物连续六个小时受到这些影响，就会被冻死。当该生物在一个温暖的地方呆了至少一个小时后，这些影响就会结束。",
	"Icespire Hold is so tucked away in the mountains that few people know of its existence, let alone anything about its history or current state. Characters might learn of it after experiencing a vision at the {@adventure Shrine of Savras|DIP|11}, or they might search for it on their own.

	"Clouds partly obscure a stone fortress situated atop the icy spur of a jagged, snow-covered mountain that you recognize as Icespire Peak, a landmark so enormous as to be visible from Phandalin on a clear day. The mountain dwarfs the fortress, which consists of two separate structures joined together by a stone bridge.

	"If the dragon realizes intruders are near but can't determine their whereabouts, it lets out a roar and takes to the air. As it circles the fortress, it glances around for signs of intrusion. If it finds nothing to attack, it returns to the rooftop and waits for intruders to come to it. The dragon is small enough that it can squeeze through doorways and passageways, but it needs an incentive to enter the fortress because it dislikes confined spaces. Like most white dragons, Cryovain is slow-witted and easily baited.": "如果龙意识到入侵者就在附近，但无法确定他们的下落，它就会发出一声怒吼，并腾空而起。当它绕过堡垒时，它瞥了一眼周围的入侵迹象。如果没有发现可以攻击的东西，它就回到屋顶上，等待入侵者来找它。这条龙很小，可以挤过门洞和通道，但它需要一个诱因来进入堡垒，因为它不喜欢封闭的空间。像大多数白龙一样，Cryovain头脑迟钝，容易上钩。",
