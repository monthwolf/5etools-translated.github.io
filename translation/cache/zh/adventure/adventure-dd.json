	"A war criminal is broken out of prison by well-armed kobolds working for a mysterious mastermind who threatens the gnomish city of Hupperdook. \"Dangerous Designs\" is an adventure that takes characters from 1st to 3rd level, and which introduces them to the Western Wynandir region of the continent under the rule of the Dwendalian Empire. This region is geared toward adventures that involve monster hunting, political intrigue, and the war with Xhorhas.": "一个战犯被全副武装的哥布林带出监狱，他为一个威胁地精城市Hupperdook的神秘主谋工作。\"危险的设计 \"是一次冒险，需要1到3级的角色，并向他们介绍德文达里亚帝国统治下的大陆西部威南迪尔地区。这个地区面向的是涉及怪物狩猎、政治阴谋和与Xhorhas的战争的冒险。",
	"If your players are using the heroic chronicle to create their characters (see {@book chapter 4|EGW|5|Heroic Chronicle}), they might wish to create characters who grew up in the Zemni Fields or Marrow Valley, giving them a closer connection to this region and to the Dwendalian Empire. For characters not from Western Wynandir, the players should consider what has drawn those characters to Hupperdook. Because this adventure ties directly to the Kryn Dynasty's conflict with the Dwendalian Empire, you can also ask each player to consider their character's stance on the war and how the war might tie into their background.": "如果你的玩家使用英雄编年史来创建他们的角色（见{@book chapter 4|EGW|5|Heroic Chronicle}），他们可能希望创建在泽姆尼田野或骨髓谷长大的角色，让他们与这个地区和德温达里亚帝国有更紧密的联系。对于不是来自西威南迪尔的角色，玩家应该考虑是什么吸引这些角色来到胡珀杜克。因为这次冒险直接关系到克莱恩王朝与德文达尔帝国的冲突，你也可以要求每个玩家考虑他们的角色对战争的立场，以及战争如何与他们的背景结合。",
	"The characters are drawn into this adventure in the lower regions of the city of Hupperdook, an industrious gnomish enclave where long days of hard work in the forges and scrapyards end with evenings of extensive celebration and debauchery. A brilliant human engineer named Huron Stahlmast was assigned to Hupperdook by the Dwendalian Empire, where he led the development of weapons for the war against the Kryn Dynasty. After years of rising disapproval of his ideas and methods, Stahlmast was ousted by the folk of the city due to his eccentric experimentation and brutal means of testing his weapon designs. Shamed and without funds, the inventor allowed his dark hatred to push him to meet with agents of the Kryn Dynasty, seeking aid that would let him complete his work and enact his revenge.": "人物被吸引到Hupperdook城的下层地区进行冒险，这是一块勤劳的地精飞地，在那里，在锻造厂和废品收购站的漫长日子以广泛的庆祝和放荡的夜晚结束。一位名叫赫伦-斯塔尔马斯特（Huron Stahlmast）的杰出人类工程师被德文达利亚帝国派往胡珀杜克，在那里他领导了对克里恩王朝战争的武器开发工作。经过多年对他的想法和方法的反对，斯塔马斯特被城市的人们赶走了，因为他古怪的实验和测试他的武器设计的残酷手段。羞愧和没有资金，这位发明家让他的黑暗仇恨促使他与克里恩王朝的代理人会面，寻求援助，让他完成他的工作并实施他的复仇。",
	"With the Kryn resources now funneled to him, Stahlmast has amassed and trained a force of kobold minions to help him steal resources from Hupperdook and establish a secret subterranean base deep within the Silberquel Ridge. As construction of his experimental weapons nears completion, Stahlmast plans to use those weapons against the empire that cast him aside.": "随着克莱恩的资源现在被输送给他，Stahlmast已经聚集并训练了一支哥布林奴仆部队，帮助他从Hupperdook偷取资源，并在Silberquel山脊深处建立了一个秘密的地下基地。随着他的实验性武器的建造接近完成，Stahlmast计划用这些武器来对付将他抛弃的帝国。",
	"Stahlmast's plot to take over Hupperdook and hobble the military might of the Dwendalian Empire's gnomish war machine begins with a prison break. The target is a Kryn operative whose assistance Stahlmast needs. From there, the characters are drawn into the growing chaos orchestrated by Stahlmast and his minions, chasing down leads and eventually confronting the mad inventor within his mountain lair.": "Stahlmast接管Hupperdook并削弱Dwendalian帝国地精战争机器的军事力量的阴谋始于一次越狱。目标是一名克莱恩特工，斯塔尔马斯特需要他的帮助。从那以后，这些人物被卷入了斯塔尔马斯特和他的爪牙策划的日益混乱的局面中，追寻线索，并最终在他的山中巢穴里与这位疯狂的发明家对峙。",
	"In the first part of the adventure, even as the characters arrive in Hupperdook, a jailbreak sees a dangerous goliath prisoner of war named Sken Zabriss freed by a group of cloaked kobolds. Their violent escape route crosses the characters' path before they flee into the night. The city's watchmaster, Bram Gulchswattle, hires the characters to investigate the breakout and to discover the whereabouts of Zabriss and her kobold allies.": "在冒险的第一部分，甚至在人物到达Hupperdook的时候，一次越狱看到一个名叫Sken Zabriss的危险的巨人战俘被一群隐身的哥布林释放了。在他们逃入黑夜之前，他们暴力的逃跑路线穿过了人物的道路。城市的守望者，Bram Gulchswattle，雇佣了这些角色来调查这次越狱，并发现Zabriss和她的哥布林盟友的下落。",
	"Clues lead the adventurers to a waterfall-cloaked cavern that conceals Sken Zabriss, a force of kobolds, and a master artisan missing from the city. When the characters complete this encounter, they reach 2nd level and can return the subdued Sken Zabriss to Hupperdook and collect their reward.": "线索将冒险家们引向一个被瀑布覆盖的洞穴，那里隐藏着Sken Zabriss、一支哥布林部队和一个在城市中失踪的工匠大师。当人物完成这个遭遇时，他们就达到了第二级，可以将被制服的斯肯-扎布里斯送回胡珀杜克并领取奖励。",
	"In the final part of the adventure, the characters are urged to continue their investigation by entering Stahlmast's base—or they might pursue Sken to that base if they allowed the goliath to escape. Once inside the halls of Stahlmast's mountain compound, the adventurers must uncover the depths of the mad inventor's betrayal of the empire. The dangerous incursion culminates with an all-out battle against Stahlmast and his prototype war machine.": "在冒险的最后部分，角色们被敦促继续他们的调查，进入Stahlmast的基地--如果他们允许这个巨人逃跑的话，他们可能会追击Sken到那个基地。一旦进入Stahlmast的山庄大厅，冒险者们必须揭开这位疯狂的发明家背叛帝国的深层原因。这次危险的入侵以一场与斯塔马斯特和他的战争机器原型的全面战斗而达到高潮。",
	"Before the adventure begins, talk to your players about why their characters might have made the journey to Hupperdook. You can provide details regarding the city and the surrounding region as outlined in {@book chapter 3|EGW|4|Hupperdook}. You can also ask the players if they want to share any of their characters' goals, which might provide reasons for their group to come together. Seeking paying work, purchasing equipment, and wanting to join the war effort are all common reasons for traveling to the gnomish enclave.": "在冒险开始之前，和你的玩家谈谈为什么他们的角色可能会到Hupperdook来旅行。你可以提供关于这个城市和周围地区的细节，如{@book chapter 3|EGW|4|Hupperdook}所述。你还可以问玩家是否想分享他们的角色的任何目标，这可能为他们的小组走到一起提供理由。寻找有报酬的工作，购买装备，以及想要加入战争，都是前往地精飞地的常见原因。",
	"Use this time to also discuss if the characters are meeting for the first time or if any of them already know each other.": "利用这段时间也可以讨论一下这些人物是否是第一次见面，或者他们中是否有人已经认识对方。",
	"The adventure begins with the characters arriving (whether singly or together) in Hupperdook. {@adventure Map 5.4|DD|0|Map 5.4: Lower Hupperdook View Player Version} shows Lower Hupperdook and marks the locations of the Ironlot and Assembly Yard sections of the city.": "冒险开始时，角色们（无论是单独还是一起）到达了Hupperdook。{@adventure Map 5.4|DD|0|Map 5.4: Lower Hupperdook View Player Version}显示的是下胡珀杜克，并标出了城市中铁矿区和集会场的位置。",
	"Once the players are ready to begin, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to set the scene:": "一旦玩家准备好开始，就读或转述以下方框内的文字，以设定场景。",
	"A chi7lled, misty night hangs over the industrious mountainside city of Hupperdook, the scent of a recent rain on the air as you walk the muddied path. The nightly festivities have already begun, with the elevated section of the city known as the Idleworks Shelf alight with colorful lanterns and streamers. The distant sounds of music and firecrackers echo from hundreds of feet up the stairs of the mountain. You arrive at the quiet, dark fields of the Assembly Yard, passing massive forges and partially constructed war machines. All the city's industry has seemingly been abandoned for the night, while the workers of Hupperdook unwind in the celebrations of the upper city.": "在勤劳的山边城市胡珀杜克上空笼罩着一个气雾弥漫的夜晚，当你走在泥泞的小路上时，空气中弥漫着最近一场雨的气味。夜间的庆祝活动已经开始，城市的高架部分被称为 \"闲置工程架\"，上面挂满了五颜六色的灯笼和彩旗。远处的音乐声和鞭炮声从数百英尺高的山阶上回荡。你来到集结场安静、黑暗的场地，经过巨大的锻造厂和部分建造的战争机器。所有城市的工业似乎都已被放弃过夜，而胡珀杜克的工人们则在上层城市的庆祝活动中放松。",
	"Start by having the players describe their characters and determine which of them are traveling together. If they arrive as an established party, prompt them to talk about their collective goals in coming to Hupperdook. If they arrive as smaller groups or solo characters, play out their interactions as smaller vignettes covering how they cross each other's paths, prompting introductions on the way to a destined meeting. Either way, point out that most activity appears to be happening in the upper city.": "首先，让玩家描述他们的角色，并确定他们中哪些人是一起旅行的。如果他们是作为一个既定的团队到达的，提示他们谈论他们来到Hupperdook的集体目标。如果他们是以小团体或单独的角色到达的，就把他们的互动作为小插曲来播放，包括他们是如何相互交叉的，促使他们在通往注定的会议的路上进行介绍。无论是哪种方式，都要指出大多数活动似乎都发生在上层城市。",
	"When the characters are headed past the Assembly Yard into the Ironlot area of the city, proceed with the next section.": "当人物经过集结场进入城市的Ironlot地区时，继续进行下一节。",
	"Before the characters reach the stairs to the Idleworks Shelf, read:": "在人物到达通往闲置工程架的楼梯之前，请阅读。",
	"The peace of the evening is shattered by the deafening crack of a massive explosion that rocks the southeast part of the city. At the base of the mountain, shards of rock spray the street a hundred yards from where you stand. Heavy smoke billows from a cavernous hole in the mountain wall. As you shake the ringing from your ears, six cloaked figures appear in the street, running from the source of the explosion—and charging straight toward you!": "一声震耳欲聋的爆炸声打破了夜晚的宁静，它震撼了城市的东南部分。在山脚下，岩石碎片喷洒在离你所站位置一百码远的街道上。浓重的烟雾从山壁上的一个空洞中飘出。当你甩掉耳边的铃声时，六个披着斗篷的身影出现在街上，他们从爆炸源头跑来，直接向你冲来！他们是谁？",
	"Ask each player how their character reacts. If any of the players wish to try to stop or engage with the running figures, tell everyone to roll initiative. The action begins near the mountain base of Lower Hupperdook, so see the Ironlot streets (area H1) below for more information.": "问每个玩家他们的角色是如何反应的。如果有玩家想尝试阻止或与奔跑的人物交战，告诉大家掷出主动权。行动开始于下胡珀杜克的山脚下，所以请看下面的铁矿街道（H1区）以了解更多信息。",
	"Depending on their interest or sense of curiosity, the players might wish to simply step away from the intruders and allow them to escape, perhaps following them afterward. If so, they can get a good look at the figures before one of them releases a cloud of magical fog behind them, aiding their escape and making it impossible for the characters to pursue them. If the players wish to set up a trap or surprise the cloaked figures as they rush past, ask them how they choose to prepare in the few moments available to them, then begin combat once the trap is sprung.": "根据他们的兴趣或好奇心，玩家可能希望简单地远离这些入侵者，让他们逃走，也许之后再跟着他们。如果是这样的话，他们可以在其中一个人身后释放出一团魔法雾气之前好好看看这些人物，帮助他们逃跑，使角色们无法追赶他们。如果玩家希望设置一个陷阱，或者在隐身人物冲过去的时候给他们一个惊喜，请问他们选择如何在有限的时间内做好准备，然后在陷阱启动后开始战斗。",
	"If the characters convinced Auby the gnome to guide them through the city, they've inadvertently led him into a dangerous fray. Enemies attempt to strike him if he gets in their way, and the characters might need to decide between protecting their guide and focusing on the attackers.": "如果角色们说服了地精Auby引导他们穿过城市，他们无意中把他带入了一场危险的战斗。如果他挡住了敌人的路，敌人就会试图攻击他，角色们可能需要在保护他们的向导和关注攻击者之间做出决定。",
	"If any kobold underlings are reduced to 0 hit points during the fight, the characters have only 2 rounds to investigate and loot the corpse before the body begins to emit a high-pitched whine. If a kobold was reduced to 0 hit points by a critical hit, it explodes immediately (see the Messy End trait in the kobold underling's stat block).": "如果任何哥布林下属在战斗中被降低到0命中率，在尸体开始发出高亢的哀鸣之前，角色只有2个回合的时间来调查和掠夺尸体。如果一个哥布林被一个关键性的打击减为0命中率，它会立即爆炸（见哥布林下属状态块中的混乱结局特性）。",
	"If the characters manage to subdue or capture any kobolds, their loyalty to Stahlmast is hard to break. A successful DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) check begins to turn a captured kobold, but before it can reveal any information, crossbow bolts shot from the distant shadows (where more of Stahlmast's loyal forces are watching) silences the would-be confessor.": "如果人物设法制服或捕获任何哥布林，他们对Stahlmast的忠诚是难以打破的。一个成功的DC15魅力({@skill Intimidation})检定开始使被俘的哥布林变身，但在它能透露任何信息之前，从远处阴影中射出的弩箭（Stahlmast的忠诚部队在那里监视）使这个可能的忏悔者沉默。",
	"Bram might recognize the characters as adventurers by their actions in trying to stop the escaping criminals (if they did so), by their attire and equipment, or if they introduce themselves as such. Either way, he offers to hire them. He describes the runaway goliath as Sken Zabriss, a prisoner of war, but has no idea who the kobolds were. He offers a bounty of 500 gp to anyone who will hunt down and bring Sken back, as well as investigate who was responsible for breaking her out. Bram offers 250 gp up front. If the contract is accepted, he presents the characters with a copper-and-gold badge that indicates they are working under his authority. While the emblem is visible, all the characters have advantage on Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) checks made to pry information from stubborn citizens of Hupperdook.": "布拉姆可能会通过他们试图阻止逃跑的罪犯的行为（如果他们这样做的话），通过他们的服装和装备，或者通过他们的自我介绍，认出这些人物是冒险家。无论怎样，他都愿意雇用他们。他将逃跑的巨人描述为战俘斯肯-扎布里斯，但不知道哥布林是谁。他提供了500金币的赏金给任何能追捕并带回斯肯的人，并调查是谁把她带出来的。布拉姆先提供250金币。如果合同被接受，他就会给人物颁发一个铜金徽章，表明他们是在他的授权下工作。在徽章可见的情况下，所有人物在向胡珀杜克的顽固市民打探消息时，在魅力({@skill Persuasion})的检查上都有优势。",
	"The characters can travel across Lower Hupperdook to hunt down their quarry. If they ask Bram for guidance on where to look first, he points them in the direction of the smoking hole in the side of the mountain, at the site of Gearhole Prison.": "人物可以穿越下胡珀杜克（Lower Hupperdook）去追捕他们的猎物。如果他们向布拉姆请教先去哪里找，他就会指给他们看山边那个冒烟的洞，也就是齿轮洞监狱的位置。",
	"If the adventurers head toward Gearhole Prison, read:": "如果冒险者向齿轮孔监狱进发，请阅读。",
	"It's easy to see the metallic sheen of many tall steel plates affixed to the mountainside—the outer walls of Gearhole Prison. Moonlight and still-smoldering fires frame the billowing smoke that pours from a gaping cavity in the rock and metal, marking the violent escape route taken by the goliath and her accomplices.": "很容易看到贴在山坡上的许多高大钢板的金属光泽--齿轮孔监狱的外墙。月光和仍在燃烧的火苗映衬着从岩石和金属的空隙中涌出的滚滚浓烟，这标志着巨人和她的同伙采取的暴力逃亡路线。",
	"When the characters are led to the scene of the escape, read:": "当人物被领到逃亡现场时，读。",
	"A ten-foot-wide hole edged with twisted steel and jagged rock opens up above a pile of rubble. Beyond the hole is a badly damaged stone prison cell, little more than soot-stained walls and an overturned bed charred on one side. A thin skylight above the hole matches others alongside it in the steel wall, and was apparently the cell's window. A mangled chamber pot is embedded in the right wall, where a elf in a long leather coat is pulling it from the stone. She pockets three charred pieces of paper from the brass pot before turning and acknowledging your presence.": "在一堆瓦砾之上，打开了一个十英尺宽的洞，边上是扭曲的钢铁和锯齿状的岩石。洞外是一间被严重损坏的石制牢房，除了被烟熏过的墙壁和一边被烧焦的翻倒的床之外，没有其他东西。洞口上方有一个薄薄的天窗，与旁边的钢墙上的其他天窗相匹配，显然是牢房的窗户。一个残缺不全的罐子嵌在右边的墙上，一个穿着长皮大衣的精灵正在把它从石头上拉下来。她从铜锅里掏出三张烧焦的纸片，然后转过身来，承认你的存在。",
	"The elf asks the characters their business, and introduces herself as {@creature Yinra Emberwind|EGW} (see her stat block later in the adventure), a bounty hunter who heard the commotion from the Idleworks Shelf. She brags about having already finished her work here, and wishes the characters good luck in finding Sken before she does. The characters can attempt to barter for the paper Yinra recovered, which she relinquishes for 50 gp in coins or other treasure. A character who wants to steal the paper from Yinra while she's engaged in conversation must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check. On a failure, Yinra grabs the would-be thief's hand and laughs at them before leaving.": "这名精灵询问人物的业务，并自我介绍说她是{@creature Yinra Emberwind|EGW}（见她在冒险中的数据块），是一名赏金猎人，从闲置工程架上听到了骚动。她吹嘘自己已经完成了在这里的工作，并祝愿角色们好运，在她之前找到斯肯。角色们可以尝试用Yinra找回的纸来交换，她放弃了50戈比的硬币或其他宝物。想在殷拉谈话时从她那里偷纸的角色必须在DC18的灵巧（{@skill Sleight of Hand}）检查中成功。如果失败，Yinra会抓住这个想偷东西的人的手，在离开前对他们大笑。",
	"Worry not. I am an ally of your comm..... no questions.": "不要担心。我是你们的盟友，.....，没有问题。",
	"Take this ring and follow.... my humble domain....tand back!": "拿着这枚戒指，跟随....，我卑微的领域....，回来！",
	"A character who investigates the rubble confirms that the explosion came from inside the room, with most of the stone and steel having been blown out from the inside. A successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check notes signs of multiple simultaneous explosions at various points on the inside wall.": "对废墟进行调查的人物证实，爆炸来自房间内部，大部分的石头和钢铁都是从里面被炸出来的。成功通过DC12智力检查({@skill Investigation})可以注意到在内墙的不同点上有多个同时爆炸的迹象。",
	"Use the following to guide the next steps of the characters' investigation:": "使用以下内容来指导人物调查的下一步。",
	"If they ask about the automaton, the characters are directed toward Master Maker Cleff Tinkertop. His shop in the Idleworks Shelf has been closed since the war picked up. The city's leaders keep him and his daughter Rissa working on warfare designs down in the Builder's Plot ({@adventure area h3|DD|0|H3. The Builder's Plot}).": "如果他们问起自动机，这些人物会被引向制造大师克里夫-廷克托普。自从战争开始后，他在闲置工厂货架上的商店就被关闭了。城市的领导人让他和他的女儿Rissa在建造者的地盘上进行战争设计（{@adventure area h3|DD|0|H3. The Builder's Plot}）。",
	"If the characters ask around regarding explosives or blasting powder, helpful citizens can point them toward the city's only sanctioned creators of such things at the Firemark Facility ({@adventure area H5|DD|0|H5. Firemark Facility}).": "如果人物四处打听炸药或爆破粉，热心的市民可以把他们引向本市唯一认可的火印设施({@adventure area H5|DD|0|H5. Firemark Facility})的创造者。",
	"If the characters ask if anyone saw where Sken and the kobolds escaped to, a number of people saw them running toward the north side of the city, but they eventually vanished from sight in the shadows.": "如果人物问是否有人看到斯肯和哥布林逃到了哪里，有不少人看到他们向城市的北面跑去，但他们最终在阴影中消失了。",
	"Asking about strange happenings in the city recently, a number of builders and designers complain of a growing rash of thefts. Tools, raw materials, metal ingots, and other manufacturing supplies are consistently targeted, though always in small amounts.": "在询问最近在该市发生的奇怪事件时，一些建筑商和设计师抱怨说，盗窃事件越来越多。工具、原材料、金属锭和其他制造用品一直是目标，尽管数量总是很少。",
	"If the adventurers head toward the Builder's Plot, read:": "如果冒险者朝建筑商的地盘走去，请阅读。",
	"Stepping past the outer walls of the city brings you back into the dusty expanse of the Assembly Yard. Row after row of shaded construction bays and towers flank partially built catapults, heavy cannons, and other odd, experimental weaponry encircled by metal fences. Following the directions you were given to the Builder's Plot leads you toward high piles of metal sheeting and the sounds of incessant hammering.": "走过城市的外墙，你又回到了尘土飞扬的集结场。一排又一排的阴凉的建筑台面和塔楼侧面是部分建成的弹射器、重炮和其他奇怪的、被金属栅栏包围的实验性武器。循着建造者地块的指示，你走向高高堆起的金属板和不断敲打的声音。",
	"Cleff is an amiable middle-aged gnome, albeit a bit absent-minded and easily distracted. Rissa is sharp and keeps her father on track as best she can. If they are asked about explosives or shown the bronze shrapnel, they direct the characters toward the Firemark Facility ({@adventure area H5|DD|0|H5. Firemark Facility}), the only sanctioned manufacturing den of {@item blasting powder|EGW} and black powder in Hupperdook.": "克莱夫是一个和蔼可亲的中年地精，尽管有点心不在焉，容易分心。瑞莎很敏锐，尽其所能地让她的父亲走上正轨。如果他们被问及炸药或展示青铜弹片，他们会引导人物走向火印设施（{@adventure area H5|DD|0|H5. Firemark Facility}），这是胡珀杜克唯一被认可的{@item blasting powder|EGW}和黑火药的制造场所。",
	"If the characters show Cleff the damaged automaton, he recognizes the design as his own. Thinking at first that the device might be one of his older models, he inspects it further and scoffs at the realization that it is a poor copy. The crafting reminds him of the work of an old colleague of his—Huron Stahlmast. Talented but impatient, Stahlmast was prone to copying the work of others and executing it poorly. He hasn't been seen in Hupperdook for years.": "如果人物向克莱夫展示了损坏的自动装置，他就会认出这个设计是他自己的。起初，他认为这个装置可能是他的一个旧型号，但他进一步检查后，发现这是一个糟糕的复制品，于是嘲笑道。这种工艺使他想起了他的一位老同事--胡伦-斯塔尔马斯特的作品。斯塔尔马斯特才华横溢，但缺乏耐心，他很容易复制别人的作品，而且执行得很糟糕。他已经多年没有在Hupperdook出现了。",
	"If the characters are particularly interested in the functionality of the broken automaton, Cleff offers to repair it. Doing so takes a few hours and costs 15 gp for materials, whereupon the characters are the owners of a {@item vox seeker|EGW} (see {@book chapter 6|EGW|7|Vox Seeker}).": "如果人物对坏掉的自动装置的功能特别感兴趣，Cleff就会提议修理它。这样做需要几个小时，需要花费15戈比的材料费，然后人物就会成为一个{@item vox seeker|EGW}的主人（见{@book chapter 6|EGW|7|Vox Seeker}）。",
	"If the adventurers find their way to this shop, read:": "如果冒险家们找到这家商店，请阅读。",
	"Navigating the winding streets of the Ironlot, you find a wedge-shaped hutch of smoke-stained thatch and warped wood. A faded sign bearing the name \"Lay of the Land\" dangles above the door. Entering the shaded interior, you are greeted by all manner of smells, from pungent fungi, to dried weeds, to burning incense. A woman turns toward you where she eats at a corner table, her smiling mouth half-filled with food, her voluminous black hair framing her face.": "在铁矿区蜿蜒曲折的街道上，你找到了一个由烟熏火燎的茅草和扭曲的木头组成的楔形小屋。门上挂着一个褪色的牌子，上面写着 \"Lay of the Land\"。进入阴暗的室内，你被各种气味所吸引，从刺鼻的真菌，到干枯的野草，再到燃烧的香。一个女人转向你，她在角落的一张桌子上吃饭，她微笑的嘴里装着一半的食物，她丰满的黑发衬托着她的脸。",
	"If the characters describe the stained, muddy feet of the kobolds who helped break Sken Zabriss out of prison, she tells them that red clay shouldn't be found in Hupperdook. The most likely place for it to have come from is farther up the mountain, near the long-dormant volcanic caps of the Silberquel Ridge.": "如果人物描述了帮助斯肯-扎布里斯越狱的哥布林的沾满泥土的脚，她就会告诉他们，在胡珀杜克不应该有红色粘土。它最有可能来自更远的山上，靠近希尔伯克尔山脊长期休眠的火山帽。",
	"When the adventurers arrive at the Firemark Facility, read:": "当冒险者到达火印设施时，请阅读。",

As you draw near, a gnome guard approaches you with a suspicious look.": "这座棕红色的砖瓦建筑比你想象的要大，它的黑铁屋顶延伸到一个巨大的院落。这里的空气中弥漫着硫磺和炸药的气味，这些气味在牢房里是很熟悉的。当你走近时，一个地精警卫带着怀疑的眼神向你走来。",
	"If asked about the ill artisan, Sleese mentions that a gnome named Nima Cinnarid had been one of the Firemark Facility's most diligent suppliers of raw materials and most skilled crafters of high-quality blasting powder, at least until she took ill three weeks ago. She's been holed up in her house in the northern part of the Ironlot ever since. A few of her Firemark compatriots have tried to visit her, but she won't let anyone in. Sleese is noticeably fearful over how bad this illness might be.": "如果被问及生病的工匠，Sleese提到，一个名叫尼玛-辛纳瑞德（Nima Cinnarid）的地精一直是火印设施最勤奋的原材料供应商和最熟练的高质量爆破粉工匠之一，至少在她三周前生病之前是这样。从那时起，她就一直躲在铁矿区北部的房子里。她的几个火印同胞曾试图探望她，但她不让任何人进去。Sleese对这种疾病可能有多严重感到明显的恐惧。",
	"Sleese offers a pouch of {@item blasting powder|EGW} (see the \"{@adventure Alchemical Items|DD|0|Alchemical Items}\" sidebar later in the adventure) as a gift if the characters agree to check in on Nima Cinnarid.

	"The front and side doors to the house are locked, but can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. Knocking once on the front door yields no answer, but a second knock summons a coughing, creaky voice from the other side that falteringly tells the characters to stay away for fear of catching the sickness. Any character with a passive Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) score of 15 or higher, or who is successful on a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check, recognizes that the voice is nervous—and is definitely not a female gnome.": "房子的正门和侧门都是锁着的，但如果使用盗贼的工具，通过DC15的灵巧检查，就可以打开。敲一次前门没有回应，但第二次敲门会从另一边传来一个咳嗽的、吱吱作响的声音，这个声音颤颤巍巍地告诉人物不要靠近，因为他们害怕染上疾病。任何被动智慧（{@skill Insight}）得分在15分以上的角色，或者成功通过DC 15智慧（{@skill Insight}）检查的角色，都能认出这个声音很紧张--而且绝对不是一个女地精。",
	"If the characters mention anything about the prison break, the voice pauses, then states, \"Actually, I think I might know something about that.\" As the front door is unlocked, the voice invites the characters in.": "如果人物提到关于越狱的事情，这个声音就会停顿一下，然后说：\"事实上，我想我可能知道一些事情。\" 当前门被打开的时候，这个声音邀请人物进来。",

Driven by blind vengeance, Stahlmast has become the self-styled leader of his personal army of minions, determined to punish all those who cast him aside.": "Stahlmast是一个夸夸其谈、自恋的发明家，他从来都无法接受或承认自己的缺点。这种骄傲，再加上喜欢对他不完美的设计进行危险和不道德的测试，一直阻碍着他的成功，把别人推开，看到他被放逐出Hupperdook，并毁了他曾经受人尊敬的声誉。在盲目复仇的驱使下，斯塔姆斯特已经成为他个人的奴才军队的自封领袖，决心惩罚所有将他抛弃的人。",

Clockwork Forge}.": "当角色们第一次到达这里时，有四名{@creature Kobold||kobolds}正接受伊舍尔(Ishel)—克莱恩王朝的一位黑暗精灵大使的训练。{@creature Ishel|EGW}使用{@creature drow}的属性块，但拥有24点生命值，这将他的挑战等级提升至1/2 (100经验值)。他携带着通往L10区域的宝箱和{@adventure area L19|DD|0|L19.

	"If the characters have made a lot of noise in any nearby caverns (including by opening the chest in area L10 or fighting in area L9), the three {@creature Kobold||kobolds} are pretending to sleep and have their weapons hidden. A successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check uncovers their ruse. Otherwise, any character who approaches within 10 feet of the sneaky kobolds causes all three to leap up and attack.": "如果角色在附近的洞穴里制造了很多噪音（包括在L10区域打开箱子或在L9区域战斗），这三个{@creature Kobold||kobolds}正在假装睡觉，并隐藏了武器。成功的DC 12智力检定({@skill Insight})揭穿了他们的诡计。否则，任何接近这三只狡猾的狗头人的角色都会导致它们全部跳起来并发动攻击。",
	"The blacksmith, Roguun (a lawful evil, male {@creature duergar}), is hard at work when the characters first enter this area. He attacks intruders at once but flees to join Stahlmast in the clockwork forge ({@adventure area L19|DD|0|L19. Clockwork Forge}) if he is reduced to 11 hit points or fewer. Roguun carries the keys to the volatile materials storage cavern ({@adventure area L3|DD|0|L3. Volatile Materials Storage}).": "当角色们第一次进入这个区域时，铁匠Roguun（一名{@creature duergar}的男性，守序邪恶）正在努力工作。他会立即攻击入侵者，但如果他的生命值降至11点或更低，他会逃跑去加入时钟锻造厂（{@adventure area L19|DD|0|L19.

	"The sleeping {@creature kobold underling|EGW} (see its stat block earlier in the adventure) has its chest wrapped with bloodstained bandages. If the sore and scared kobold is woken up, characters have advantage on Charisma checks to question it (see \"{@adventure Stahlmast's Minions|DD|0|Stahlmast's Minions}\" at the beginning of this section). In addition to any other information you want to reveal, the kobold complains about the pain in its chest. (Stahlmast recently implanted an {@item explosive seed|EGW} inside the kobold.)": "在冒险早期看到的睡着的{@creature kobold underling|EGW}（请参考其属性块）胸部裹着染血绷带。如果这只受伤害和惊吓的龙人被唤醒，角色在进行提问时获得优势（请参见本节开头的“{@adventure Stahlmast's Minions|DD|0|Stahlmast's Minions}”）。除了你想要透露的其他信息外，这只龙人抱怨胸部的疼痛。（最近斯塔尔马斯在这只龙人体内植入了{@item explosive seed|EGW}。）",
	"The armoire holds five sets of fine clothing, one of which has a {@item Sending Stones||sending stone} in its pocket. The stone can be found with a successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, or by anyone putting on the clothing. If the stone is activated, a voice responds in a thick accent, asking \"What is it you need?\" A successful DC 12 Intelligence check reveals the accent to be Xhorhasian. No matter what the response of the character using the stone, they must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check or the agent with the other {@item Sending Stones||sending stone} recognizes that the stones have been compromised. The other stone is then destroyed, severing the connection.": "这个衣橱里有五套精美的衣服，其中一套口袋里有一个{@item Sending Stones||sending stone}。这块石头可以通过成功的DC 12感知（Wisdom）检定{@skill Perception}找到，或者任何人穿上这套衣服也能找到。如果激活了这块石头，一个带着浓重口音的声音会回应，询问“你需要什么？”成功的DC 12智力（Intelligence）检定会揭示这个口音是索哈斯人的。无论角色使用石头做出什么回应，他们必须成功通过DC 18魅力（Charisma）检定{@skill Deception}，否则另一块石头的持有者会意识到石头已经被篡改。另一块石头随即被摧毁，切断了连接。",
	"A locked chest is hidden beneath the bed, and can be opened with thieves' tools and a successful DC 16 Dexterity check. The chest holds 170 gp, 65 sp, and two {@item Potion of Healing||potions of healing}. It also contains a letter written in Undercommon, which promises that more support and minions will soon be sent through the tunnel. The letter thanks Stahlmast for his soon-to-be fruitful alliance with Den Hythenos of the Kryn Dynasty. Turning the letter over to Watchmaster Bram Gulchswattle earns the characters an additional reward (see \"{@adventure Concluding the Adventure|DD|0|Concluding the Adventure}\" at the end of this adventure).": "一个锁着的箱子被藏在床下，可以用盗贼工具打开，需要成功通过DC 16的敏捷检定。箱子里有170 gp，65 sp，和两个{@item Potion of Healing||potions of healing}。里面还有一封用地下语写的信，承诺会很快通过隧道送来更多支援和手下。这封信感谢Stahlmast与Kryn王朝的Den Hythenos即将建立的有利联盟。将这封信交给守望长官Bram Gulchswattle会让角色们获得额外奖励（见“{@adventure Concluding the Adventure|DD|0|Concluding the Adventure}”在这次冒险的结尾处）。",
	"Huron Stahlmast (a lawful evil human {@creature cultist} wearing {@item goggles of night}) awaits the characters in this elaborate workshop. If the drow ambassador from {@adventure area L9|DD|0|L9. Training Room} or Roguun from {@adventure area L14|DD|0|L14. Smithy} escaped earlier encounters with the characters, he has joined Stahlmast here for the final fight.": "Huron Stahlmast（一名穿着{@item goggles of night}的秩序邪恶的人类{@creature cultist}）正在这个精心布置的车间等待角色。如果来自{@adventure area L9|DD|0|L9. Training Room}的黑暗精灵大使或者来自{@adventure area L14|DD|0|L14. Smithy}的Roguun在之前的交锋中逃脱了，他们现在已经加入Stahlmast，准备进行最后的战斗。",
	"The {@b Stahlmaster} (see the stat block below) surges toward the characters and attacks in a final confrontation. If the Stahlmaster drops to 0 hit points, Huron Stahlmast is ejected from the broken clockwork suit and lands {@condition prone} in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. On his next turn, he attempts to move to the secret door, use his action to unlock it, and flee down the passage to the Underdark (area L20). The door locks automatically behind him, and Stahlmast collapses the tunnel 1 round later to prevent anyone from following him.": "{@b Stahlmaster}（见下方的属性块）冲向角色并在最后一次对决中发动攻击。如果Stahlmaster的生命值降至0点，Huron Stahlmast从损坏的发条装甲中被弹出，落在距离它不超过5英尺的未被占据的空间中。在他的下一个回合，他会试图移动到秘密门口，用动作打开它，然后逃到通往地下世界（区域L20）的通道。门在他身后自动锁上，1回合后Stahlmast会坍塌隧道，以防止任何人跟随他。",
	"During the fight, any creature pushed into the open forge for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 7 ({@dice 2d6}) fire damage.": "在战斗中，任何生物第一次被推入开放的熔炉中，或者在那里开始它的回合，都会受到7 ({@dice 2d6}) 火焰伤害。",
	"A steel lever topped with a brass sphere is mounted on the east wall. If the lever is pulled, the doors to {@adventure area L12|DD|0|L12. Steam Trap} close and the steam trap in that area triggers. If the wall holes in area L12 are plugged when the lever is pulled, a jet of scalding hot steam erupts from the forge in a line that is 15 feet long and 1 foot wide, and which deals 10 ({@dice 4d4}) fire damage to each creature in its area (including the Stahlmaster while it remains in its initial position).": "东墙上安装了一个顶部带有黄铜球的钢杠。如果拉动杠杆，{@adventure area L12|DD|0|L12. Steam Trap}的门会关闭，并且该区域的蒸汽陷阱会触发。当拉动杠杆时，如果区域L12的墙孔被堵塞，一股滚烫的蒸汽会从熔炉中喷射出来，形成一条长15英尺、宽1英尺的线，对其范围内的每个生物造成10({@dice 4d4})火焰伤害（包括斯塔尔大师，只要它仍然保持在初始位置）。",
	"If Stahlmast is killed or subdued, the characters can claim his {@item goggles of night}. Any investigation of the Stahlmaster shows that it is beyond repair. However, with one hour's work, the characters can strip 350 gp of gold and silver clockwork components from it.": "如果Stahlmast被杀死或制服，角色们可以夺取他的{@item goggles of night}。对Stahlmaster的任何调查都显示它已经无法修复。然而，角色们可以在一个小时内的工作中，从中剥离出350 gp的金银发条零件。",
