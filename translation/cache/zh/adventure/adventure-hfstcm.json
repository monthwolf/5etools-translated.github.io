	"The River Shining Tavern is located in the town of Daggerford, in the Sword Coast region of the Forgotten Realms. The tavern's menu is legendary, but shipments from Holrow Homestead, the tavern's main supplier of ingredients, have suddenly stopped.": "《(辉光河畔酒馆)The River Shining Tavern》位于《(匕首渡镇)Daggerford》，位于《(被遗忘的国度)Forgotten Realms》的《(剑海岸)Sword Coast》地区。这家酒馆的菜单是传奇般的，但来自《(霍洛农场)Holrow Homestead》的食材供应突然中断了。",
	"Kaga, the tavern's head chef, is growing anxious. A week ago, he sent adventurers to Holrow Homestead to investigate, but yesterday their bodies were found floating down the river. Concerned, Kaga pleads with the characters to find out what has happened to the homestead and its proprietor, Arthur Holrow, and to bring back the ingredients for a special pasta dish beloved by the tavern's youngest patrons.": "卡加(Kaga)，这家酒馆的主厨，变得焦虑起来。一周前，他派冒险者去霍洛农场(Holrow Homestead)进行调查，但昨天他们的尸体被发现漂浮在河里。卡加担心地请求角色们去找出发生在农场及其所有者亚瑟·霍洛(Arthur Holrow)身上的事情，并带回一道特别意大利面菜的食材，这道菜深受酒馆最年轻顾客的喜爱。",
	"On arriving at the homestead, the characters discover a fire giant named Ignis and her twin toddlers, Flauma and Calor. If the characters convince Ignis they mean her and her children no harm, the characters can peacefully look around the homestead for the ingredients they need.": "抵达农舍后，角色们发现了一位名叫伊格尼丝(Ignis)的火巨人，以及她的双胞胎幼儿，弗劳玛(Flauma)和卡洛尔(Calor)。如果角色们成功说服伊格尼丝，表明他们并不想伤害她和她的孩子，那么角色们就可以和平地在农舍周围寻找他们需要的材料。",
	"While the characters are collecting the ingredients, fire giant warriors searching for Ignis track her to the homestead. Suddenly there's more at stake than a bowl of magic noodles—if the characters don't intervene, Ignis's children will be abducted by a cruel villain.": "当角色们正在收集食材时，火巨人战士们追踪到了伊格尼丝的住所。突然间，不仅仅是一碗魔法面条的事情受到威胁——如果角色们不干预，伊格尼丝的孩子们将被一个残忍的恶棍绑架。",
	"Before running this adventure, check with each player to see if they're open to playing in an adventure where children are in danger (though the villains intend to capture the children and not harm them). You can adjust the adventure so the giants seek only to harm Ignis, leaving the children alone.": "在开始这个冒险之前，请与每位玩家确认是否愿意参与一个儿童处于危险中的冒险（尽管恶棍们打算抓住孩子而不是伤害他们）。你可以调整冒险，让巨人只追求伤害伊格尼斯，让孩子们安全。",
	"As the characters walk through the streets of Daggerford, they find themselves drawn to the delicious aroma emanating from the River Shining Tavern. When they enter, Jacque—a tall, thin man wearing a crisp white jacket—greets them. Jacque is the head waiter. Seeing the characters are adventurers, he hustles them into the kitchen. There he introduces them to Kaga, the head chef. Kaga is usually pleasant but formal; today, however, his tone is grave. He shares the following information:": "当角色们穿过Daggerford的街道时，他们被从River Shining Tavern散发出来的美味香气所吸引。当他们进入时，Jacque——一个穿着一件干净的白色夹克的高瘦男子——迎接他们。Jacque是首席服务员。看到角色们是冒险者，他迅速把他们带进了厨房。在那里，他介绍他们给Kaga，这位主厨。Kaga通常很和蔼但拘谨；然而，今天他的语气很严肃。他分享以下信息：",
	"\"Jacque was wise to bring you to me. I have need of adventurers such as yourselves, but it's a matter of the utmost discretion. If you are willing to help, together we will bring joy to all the children of Daggerford. And your reward! You shall dine on the most delicious food you have ever tasted, food that grants you a magical boon. Will you help me and the young folk of Daggerford?\"": "\"Jacque明智地把你带到我这里。我需要像你们这样的冒险者，但这是一项极端谨慎的事情。如果你们愿意帮忙，我们将一起给Daggerford所有的孩子带来快乐。而你们的奖励！你们将享用到有史以来最美味的食物，这种食物会赐予你们魔法的恩惠。你们愿意帮助我和Daggerford的年轻人吗？\"",
	"If the adventurers agree to help, proceed to \"What Kaga Knows.\"": "如果冒险者们同意帮助，继续前往“卡加(Kaga)所知”。",
	"Kaga relates that the tavern's secret supplier, an eccentric druid named Arthur Holrow, has an extensive garden and dairy farm known as Holrow Homestead. Arthur's unique produce and dairy products are of the highest quality and have magical properties. When these ingredients are cooked into dishes by someone exceptionally well trained (\"one such as myself,\" Kaga notes), the dishes grant magical boons to those who eat them.": "卡加（Kaga）提到，酒馆的秘密供应商是一位古怪的德鲁伊，名叫亚瑟·霍洛（Arthur Holrow），他在霍洛农庄（Holrow Homestead）拥有一片广阔的花园和奶牛场。亚瑟种植的独特农产品和奶制品质量上乘，具有魔法属性。当这些食材被一个训练有素的人（卡加指出是“像我这样的人”）烹饪成菜肴时，这些菜肴会赋予食用者魔法恩惠。",
	"These special ingredients have helped make Kaga's dishes famous all over the Sword Coast—particularly Kaga's Stumblenoodles, which are the hallmark of the tavern's children's menu. But Kaga hasn't heard from Arthur for a month and is very worried.": "这些特殊的食材帮助使Kaga的菜肴在剑海岸广为人知——尤其是Kaga的Stumblenoodles，这是酒馆儿童菜单的招牌菜。但Kaga已经一个月没收到Arthur的消息，非常担心。",
	"A week ago, the tavern hired adventurers to investigate Holrow Homestead, but local authorities found the lifeless bodies of these adventurers yesterday morning. They had been beaten and thrown into the Delimbiyr River, eventually floating downriver to Daggerford. Kaga describes these adventurers as young and brash. \"They were the sort of adventurers who draw swords first and ask questions later. Hiring them was my mistake. But Arthur is a peaceful man, and I can't believe he's responsible for their deaths. I hope you can solve this mystery without further violence.\"": "一周前，酒馆雇佣了冒险者去调查霍洛农场，但当地当局昨天早上发现了这些冒险者的尸体。他们被殴打后扔进了德林比尔河，最终漂流到了达格福德。卡加描述这些冒险者年轻而鲁莽。“他们是那种先拔剑后问问题的冒险者。雇佣他们是我的错误。但阿瑟是个和平的人，我不相信他对他们的死负责。希望你能解开这个谜团，而不需要更多暴力。”",
	"Kaga fears for Arthur's life, but he's desperate for answers. He hopes the characters can figure out what's going on at Holrow Homestead and restart regular shipments, or at least collect the ingredients for Kaga's Stumblenoodles. If the characters agree to investigate and return with the necessary ingredients, Kaga will prepare the party a magical dish as payment.": "卡加为亚瑟的生命感到担忧，但他急于找到答案。他希望角色们能够弄清楚霍洛农场发生了什么事，并重新开始定期发货，或者至少收集卡加手忙脚乱面条的配料。如果角色们同意调查并带回必要的配料，卡加将为派对准备一道魔法菜作为报酬。",
	"Kaga needs the following ingredients to prepare his famous Stumblenoodles:": "Kaga需要以下食材来准备他著名的Stumblenoodles：",
	"{@area One can of milk|024|x} from Holrow's specially fed cows": "从霍洛(Holrow)的特别喂养的奶牛中提取{@area One can of milk|024|x}",
	"{@area A wheel of Holrow cheese|010|x}, aged exactly seven seasons": "{@area A wheel of Holrow cheese|010|x}，年龄正好七个季节",
	"{@area A small bag of mustard seeds|029|x} from Arthur Holrow's garden": "从亚瑟霍洛{@area A small bag of mustard seeds|029|x}的花园",
	"Kaga got the recipe for Stumblenoodles from a kender adventurer who hailed from the world of Krynn. ({@race Kender|DSotDQ} and Krynn are both described in {@adventure Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen|DSotDQ}.) This kender told Kaga dozens of wild stories about traveling the multiverse, but Kaga believed none of them. Regardless, the kender didn't stay long, and Kaga rechristened the recipe in his own name. It has proven incredibly popular with the children of Daggerford. You can find {@area the recipe|037|x} for the original Kender Stumblenoodles at the end of this adventure and in {@i Heroes' Feast: Flavors of the Multiverse}.": "卡加从一位来自克瑞恩世界的肯德冒险者那里得到了“绊绊面”（Stumblenoodles）的食谱。({@race Kender|DSotDQ}和克瑞恩都在{@adventure Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen|DSotDQ}中描述。) 这位肯德告诉卡加许多关于穿越多元宇宙的疯狂故事，但卡加并不相信。尽管如此，这位肯德没有久留，卡加将这道食谱以自己的名字重新命名。它在达格福德的孩子们中间非常受欢迎。你可以在这次冒险的结尾和{@i Heroes' Feast: Flavors of the Multiverse}找到原版肯德“绊绊面”的食谱。",
	"Holrow Homestead is a farm that has been in the Holrow family for generations. The two-story, saltbox farmhouse is built atop a hill with a huge secret (see the \"Secret of Holrow Homestead\" sidebar). Arthur Holrow was one of twelve children, born to parents of hardy country stock. Naturally quite shy, Arthur kept to himself. While his siblings were drawn to lofty pursuits and traveled far and wide to make names for themselves, Arthur stayed home and took care of his aging parents. The Holrow name is well known, and many members of the family became accomplished magicians or crafters. But little is known about Arthur Holrow.": "Holrow Homestead（霍洛农场）是一座世代相传的农场，属于霍洛家族。这座两层楼的盐箱式农舍建在一座小山上，隐藏着一个巨大的秘密（见“Holrow Homestead的秘密”侧边栏）。亚瑟·霍洛（Arthur Holrow）是十二个孩子中的一个，出生在勇敢的乡村家庭。亚瑟天生害羞，喜欢独来独往。他的兄弟姐妹们都追求高远的目标，四处奔波以谋求名利，而亚瑟则守在家中照顾年迈的父母。霍洛这个姓氏很有名，家族中许多成员都成为了优秀的魔法师或工匠。但关于亚瑟·霍洛，人们知之甚少。",
	"It turns out young Arthur conducted magical experiments when he wasn't helping his mom and dad on the farm. He was eventually able to produce magically enhanced crops and farm animals, which he sold to surrounding towns at a healthy profit. When his parents died twenty years ago, he buried them in a small plot on the west side of the property. Arthur continued his thriving business and lived a quiet, contented life alone at Holrow Homestead.": "原来年轻的亚瑟在不帮助父母在农场的时候进行了魔法实验。最终，他成功地生产出了经过魔法增强的作物和农场动物，然后将它们以可观的利润卖给周边的城镇。二十年前，他的父母去世了，他将他们埋葬在了财产西侧的一小块地里。亚瑟继续经营着他蓬勃发展的生意，在霍尔罗农场过着安静、满足的独居生活。",
	"The animals and plants that grow on and around the hill at Holrow Homestead are extraordinary. That's partly due to Arthur's magical experiments and his skill with druidic magic. But there's another, more ominous reason for the land's fecundity.": "在霍尔罗农场（Holrow Homestead）的山丘上生长的动植物是非同寻常的。这在一定程度上归功于亚瑟（Arthur）的魔法实验和他在德鲁伊魔法上的技艺。但这片土地肥沃的背后还有另一个更不祥的原因。",
	"The hill at Holrow Homestead covers a slumbering giant, a grandchild of Annam known as a {@creature scion of Grolantor|BGG}. This enormous giant came down from the foothills and lay down to sleep here many centuries ago. A sleeping scion of Grolantor magically enhances plant and animal growth around it, resulting in rich crops and thriving livestock. Arthur never learned this secret, but he recorded his suspicions in a book in the house's library (see {@area area 2|01a|x} later in the adventure).": "在霍尔罗农场的山丘上，隐藏着一位沉睡的巨人，一个安南的后代，被称为{@creature scion of Grolantor|BGG}。这位巨大的巨人在许多个世纪前从山麓降临并躺下来在这里沉睡。作为格罗兰托的后裔，这位沉睡的巨人通过魔法增强了周围植物和动物的生长，导致丰收和牲畜蓬勃发展。亚瑟从未得知这个秘密，但他在房子的图书馆里记录了他的怀疑（见冒险后的{@area area 2|01a|x}）。",
	"Scions of the Giant Gods are detailed in {@book Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants|BGG}.": "巨人之神的传人在{@book Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants|BGG}中有详细描述。",
	"About a month ago, Arthur heard a loud noise outside. When he went to investigate, he found a fire giant running up the hillside toward his house, with two young fire giant children held close to her chest. She seemed eager to hide, so Arthur opened the doors to his barn and magically regrew the pasture grass to cover her tracks. She accepted his help, and they waited quietly together as they listened for her pursuers.": "大约一个月前，亚瑟听到外面传来一阵巨大的响声。当他去调查时，他发现一个火巨人正沿着山坡朝他的房子跑来，怀里紧紧抱着两个年幼的火巨人孩子。她似乎急于躲藏，于是亚瑟打开了谷仓的门，用魔法重新长出牧草来掩盖她的踪迹。她接受了他的帮助，他们静静地等待，一起倾听着追捕者的动静。",
	"Sure enough, heavy footfalls soon stomped up the hill toward the house, and a hushed conversation took place just outside the barn doors, but eventually the pursuers moved on.": "果然，沉重的脚步很快就朝着房子的方向跺上了山坡，一场压低声音的对话就在谷仓门外进行，但最终追捕者们离开了。",
	"Arthur allowed the fire giant mother and her children to stay, and the giants bonded to Arthur gradually. They never had a common language but communicated through pantomime and learned each other's names. Arthur's generous heart embraced the whole family. He made space for them in the main house by pulling down the second story, boarding up the windows, and opening up the ground level, and Ignis and the children moved in.": "亚瑟允许火巨人母亲和她的孩子们留下来，巨人们逐渐与亚瑟建立了联系。他们虽然没有共同的语言，但通过比划交流，并学会了彼此的名字。亚瑟慷慨的心融化了整个家庭。他为他们在主屋里腾出空间，拆掉了二楼，用木板封住了窗户，打开了底层，伊格尼斯(Ignis)和孩子们搬了进去。",
	"Ignis was a queen among her people, but when she gave birth to her twins, she felt the mood at court change. The twins' father wasn't a noble, and one of her trusted advisers, Lord Invido, suggested this consort might try to usurp her throne. But it was Invido himself who coveted her power.": "伊格尼丝(Ignis)是她人民中的女王，但当她生下双胞胎时，她感觉到宫廷的氛围发生了变化。双胞胎的父亲并不是贵族，她信任的顾问之一，因维多(Lord Invido)，暗示这位配偶可能试图篡夺她的王位。但实际上是因维多自己渴望她的权力。",
	"When Ignis disregarded Invido's feigned concerns, Invido took matters into his own hands. He had her consort killed and tried to abduct the heirs, intending to raise them as his own. Ignis was ready to fight for her family and throne, but Invido had already turned the other nobles against her. Outnumbered and afraid for her children, she fled.": "当Ignis无视Invido的虚伪关心时，Invido决定自己动手。他让她的亲信被杀，并试图绑架继承人，打算把他们当成自己的孩子抚养。Ignis准备为了她的家族和王位而战，但Invido已经让其他贵族背叛了她。在人数上处于劣势并担心她的孩子，她逃走了。",
	"Arthur and Ignis could never communicate well enough for him to get the whole story, but he understood that Invido is a giant who wants Ignis and her family dead and that Ignis was an influential individual among her people. Arthur sympathized with her and the children and strove to protect them at any cost.": "Arthur 和 Ignis 之间的沟通从未足够顺畅，以至于他无法完全了解整个故事，但他明白 Invido 是一个巨人，想要杀死 Ignis 和她的家人，而 Ignis 在她的族群中是一个有影响力的人物。Arthur 对她和孩子们表示同情，并努力保护他们，不惜一切代价。",
	"A week ago, when adventurers sent by the River Shining Tavern arrived at Holrow Homestead, they rashly attacked Ignis and her children. Arthur tried to defend his guests but lost his life in the attempt. Ignis, outraged by Arthur's death and the threat against her children, killed the adventurers and threw their corpses into the river. Ignis then buried Arthur in the plot next to his parents. She feels relatively safe at the homestead but remains alert for more adventurers who might threaten her family and for giants sent by Invido.": "一周前，当由河边闪光酒馆派遣的冒险者抵达霍洛农场时，他们冲动地攻击了伊格尼丝和她的孩子。亚瑟试图保护客人，但却在尝试中失去了生命。伊格尼丝对亚瑟的死亡和对她孩子的威胁感到愤怒，杀死了冒险者并将他们的尸体扔进了河里。伊格尼丝随后将亚瑟埋葬在他父母旁边的墓地。她觉得在农场相对安全，但仍然警惕可能威胁她家人的更多冒险者和因维多派遣的巨人。",
	"Supply shipments from Holrow Homestead usually come on a barge down the Delimbiyr River and take about half a day to arrive. Kaga doesn't know the exact location of the homestead, but he knows it stands atop a hill visible from the water. If the characters follow the river east, they should be able to spot it.": "霍尔罗农场(Holrow Homestead)的供应货物通常会通过德林比尔河(Delimbiyr River)上的驳船运来，大约需要半天的时间才能到达。 卡加(Kaga)不知道农场的确切位置，但他知道它坐落在一个从水面可见的山丘之上。 如果角色们沿着河向东走，他们应该能够发现它。",
	"If the characters follow the river on foot, they eventually come to a small mooring and a path that leads up a hillside to a well-kept farm nestled in the foothills of Mount Illefarn. The farm is surrounded by a fence that keeps in roaming farm animals, which are friendly to strangers. A single enormous tree rises from the hill, creating shade over the house.": "如果角色步行沿着河流前行，最终会来到一个小码头和一条通往山脚下伊勒凡山（Mount Illefarn）的小路。这个农场被一道篱笆围绕着，围着漫游的农场动物，它们对陌生人很友好。一棵巨大的树矗立在山坡上，为房屋提供阴凉。",
	"The fields and orchards around the house are exceptionally lush. A path leads up the hill to a sturdy and artistically crafted wooden gate. \"Holrow Homestead\" is painted on a sign by the gate.": "房子周围的田地和果园异常茂盛。一条小路通向山顶，那里有一扇坚固而艺术感十足的木门。“Holrow Homestead（霍洛农场）”的标牌挂在门旁。",
	"Once inside the gate, the characters are greeted by happy piglets and a few hungry goats looking for treats. Chickens cluck and scratch around the grounds, and a tough old barnyard cat looks on from its perch atop a fencepost. All the animals are healthy, and the grass is green and verdant.": "一旦进入大门，角色们会被一群快乐的小猪和几只正在寻找食物的饥饿山羊所迎接。鸡儿在场地周围咯咯叫着，啄食着，一只强壮的老农场猫则站在篱笆桩顶上注视着。所有动物都很健康，草地绿油油的。",
	"The carriageway leads up from the south to the house's front entrance. A glass greenhouse is built into the east side of the house, and a large barn is attached to the north side. Soft mooing can be heard coming from the barn.": "车道从南边通往房子的前门。一个玻璃温室建在房子的东侧，一间大谷仓附在北侧。可以听到从谷仓传来的轻柔的牛叫声。",
	"Rows of beans, garlic, shallots, cabbages, onions, and other vegetables line the hill on all sides, along with apple, cherry, pear, and quince trees and other flourishing plants that bear a plethora of fruits, nuts, and berries.": "各种蔬菜如豆类、大蒜、青葱、卷心菜、洋葱等在山坡两侧排成一排，还有苹果树、樱桃树、梨树、以及其他长势蓬勃的植物，结满了各种水果、坚果和浆果。",
	"Near the house, three-foot-high mustard plants grow in raised beds among other herbs; a character who searches the garden and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check spots them. A character can harvest the seeds from the mustard plants with a few minutes of work and a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check, rolling the seed pods between their fingers so the seeds fall out into a bag. A {@spell Detect Magic} spell reveals that a faint aura of enchantment magic emanates from the seeds.": "在房子附近，三英尺高的芥菜植物生长在凸起的花坛中，与其他草药一起；在花园中搜寻的角色如果在一次DC 12感知检定中成功({@skill Perception})，就会发现它们。角色可以通过几分钟的努力和一次成功的DC 15智力检定({@skill Nature})，从芥菜植物中收获种子，将种子荚在手指间滚动，使种子掉落到袋子里。一次{@spell Detect Magic}法术揭示，种子散发着微弱的魔法魅力光环。",
	"West of the house is a small graveyard with three simple graves. The graves lack headstones or any other way to identify who is buried there. Two of the graves are many years old, but one is newer, the dirt still fresh and heaped in an untidy pile. Plucked wildflowers lie atop this grave; although they're starting to wilt, the flowers still smell fresh.": "房子西边是一个小墓地，有三座简单的坟墓。这些坟墓没有墓碑或其他任何标识。其中两座坟墓已经有很多年了，但有一座是新的，土堆还新鲜，堆放得很凌乱。摘下的野花铺在这座坟墓上；尽管它们开始枯萎，但花的香味依然清新。",
	"Arthur's corpse lies in this fresh grave, and the {@spell Speak with Dead} spell works on him. A key inside his trouser pocket opens the safe in the house's library.": "阿瑟的尸体躺在这个新坟墓里，{@spell Speak with Dead}法术对他有效。他裤子口袋里的一把钥匙可以打开房子图书馆里的保险柜。",
	"If the characters aren't trying to be stealthy as they move about the house, Ignis, the neutral good {@creature fire giant} currently inside the barn, comes to investigate the newcomers. Otherwise, the characters must {@action hide} and succeed on a DC 16 group Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check to avoid attracting her attention.": "如果角色在房子里移动时没有试图保持潜行，中立善良的伊格尼丝，目前在谷仓里，会前来调查新来的人。否则，角色必须进行一次DC 16的团体敏捷检定，以避免引起她的注意。",
	"Ignis speaks only Giant, but she is intelligent and can tell if the characters are respectful and mean no harm. If the party has no way to talk to her, she patiently tries to communicate through pantomime. If the party convinces her of their good intentions, she allows them to search the premises. Ignis is displeased if anyone flagrantly loots the home or otherwise disrespects Arthur or his memory. Beyond that, she doesn't stop the party from taking ingredients from the farm, so long as the characters don't trample the plants or harm the animals.": "伊格尼斯(Ignis)只会说巨人语，但她很聪明，能够判断角色是否尊重并无恶意。如果队伍无法与她交流，她会耐心地尝试通过比划来沟通。如果队伍说服她他们的善意，她会允许他们搜查房屋。伊格尼斯会对任何公然抢劫家园或以其他方式不尊重亚瑟(Arthur)或他的记忆的人感到不悦。除此之外，她不会阻止队伍从农场取材料，只要角色不践踏植物或伤害动物。",
	"Ignis is suspicious of intruders, but she's also reluctant to start a fight. If the party displeases her, she becomes angry and orders them out of the house with forceful gestures. However, she won't initiate combat unless the characters threaten her or her children.": "伊格尼丝(Ignis)对闯入者持怀疑态度，但她也不愿意轻易发动战斗。如果队伍惹恼了她，她会变得愤怒，并用有力的手势命令他们离开房屋。然而，除非人物威胁到她或她的孩子，否则她不会发起战斗。",
	"If Ignis becomes hostile, a character can get her to stand down by succeeding on a DC 18 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. But any hint of a subsequent threat—or if she fears any danger will come to her children—ends negotiation and she attacks. If a fight does occur, you might remind the players that characters who reduce a target to 0 hit points can choose to leave the defeated foe alive but {@condition unconscious}. If defeated in this way and then awakened, Ignis can again be reasoned with.": "如果Ignis变得敌对，角色可以通过成功进行一次DC 18的魅力检定来让她停手。但是一旦出现任何暗示后续威胁，或者她担心自己的孩子会受到任何危险，谈判就会结束并且她会发起攻击。如果发生战斗，你可以提醒玩家，将目标击倒至0点生命值的角色可以选择让被打败的敌人保留一条命，但是{@condition unconscious}。如果以这种方式被击败然后苏醒，Ignis可以再次被说服。",
	"Ignis's children, Flauma and Calor, are noncombatants. Where the children appear later in the adventure, you'll find guidance for their interactions with the characters. Use the {@creature commoner} stat block for them, if necessary. Change their creature type to Giant and increase their Strength to 14 (+2). They're too young to speak fluently, but they know a few words of Giant (see the \"{@area Fire Giant Baby Talk|01e|x}\" sidebar later in the adventure).": "伊格尼斯的孩子，弗劳玛 (Flauma) 和卡洛尔 (Calor)，是非战斗人员。当孩子们在冒险中再次出现时，你会找到他们与角色互动的指导。必要时使用{@creature commoner}的属性块。将他们的生物类型更改为巨人，并将力量提高到14 (+2)。他们年纪太小，无法流利地说话，但懂得一些巨人语（请参阅冒险后面的“{@area Fire Giant Baby Talk|01e|x}”侧边栏）。",

Then, out from the shadows at the back of the loft space staggers Calor, a 6-foot-tall fire giant toddler. He reaches toward his mother, who snuggles him and gives him the bottle.

In the second season, winter, there were no conditions that affected the cheese. In the third season, spring, wet conditions left the salable cheese with a pink rind and the weather was hotter than expected. In the fourth season, summer, two consecutive hot seasons caused the salable cheese to double in size. In the fifth season, fall, Arthur covered the cheese, resulting in holes in the salable cheese. In the sixth season, winter, wet weather again turned the rind of the salable cheese pink, but in the final season, spring, dry weather turned the rind of the salable cheese green again.": "角色们可以使用亚瑟的{@i Cheesemonger's Almanac}（在{@area library|01a|x}中找到并在{@area appendix A|034|x}中复制）来推断亚瑟打算将哪个奶酪轮卖给卡加。为此，他们必须将亚瑟的季节报告和年鉴中的奶酪样品观察表与货架上的奶酪轮进行比较：在第一个季节，秋天，潮湿的天气使得可销售的奶酪的外皮变成了粉红色。在第二个季节，冬天，没有任何影响奶酪的条件。在第三个季节，春天，潮湿的条件使得可销售的奶酪外皮呈现粉红色，天气比预期的更热。在第四个季节，夏天，连续两个炎热的季节导致可销售的奶酪体积翻倍。在第五个季节，秋天，亚瑟盖住了奶酪，导致可销售的奶酪上出现了洞。在第六个季节，冬天，潮湿的天气再次使得可销售的奶酪外皮变成了粉红色，但在最后一个季节，春天，干燥的天气使得可销售的奶酪外皮再次变成了绿色。",

A hound that uses the {@action Search} action and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) catches a whiff of the children's scent. If the hounds succeed on two such checks, they pinpoint the children's location. Invido's fire giants attack Ignis and the characters first, pursuing the children only if there are no defenders present.

	"If Ignis survives and the characters helped protect her children, she gives the characters a nod of appreciation. If she wasn't already friendly to them, she becomes friendly now. Indeed, a grateful tear runs down her cheek. She speaks with them freely in Giant and gladly tells her story. She has resolved to return home and reclaim control from Invido. But first, she must recover and make a plan. She'll hide in the mountains while she does so, and if the characters wish to help her, that's where they'll find her. If none of the characters speaks Giant, she tries to pantomime her thanks and her plan to head into the mountains to hide temporarily. If Ignis doesn't survive, but her children do, the characters must decide how to protect Flauma and Calor.": "如果伊格尼丝幸存下来，并且角色们帮助保护她的孩子，她会向角色们点头以示感激。如果她之前对他们不友好，现在她会变得友好起来。的确，一滴感激的眼泪从她的脸颊上流下。她用巨人语自由地与他们交谈，并乐意讲述自己的故事。她已经决定要回家，夺回对因维多的控制权。但首先，她必须恢复体力并制定计划。在这段时间里，她会藏在山中，如果角色们想帮助她，他们会在那里找到她。如果没有角色会说巨人语，她会试图用手势表达感谢以及她计划暂时躲进山中的意图。如果伊格尼丝没有幸存下来，但她的孩子们幸存，角色们必须决定如何保护弗劳玛和卡洛尔。",

	"If the characters retrieved all the ingredients, Kaga prepares a feast fit for heroes. Jacque places a heaping plate of Kaga's Stumblenoodles in the center of the large round table, along with anything else the characters desire (you can use dishes from {@i Heroes' Feast: Flavors of the Multiverse} to round out the tavern's menu). Many children from the town of Daggerford join the party for a great feast. Everyone digs in, family style. Characters who have a serving of Stumblenoodles begin to feel a tingling sensation all over. They gain the {@reward Charm of the Stumblenoodle|HFStCM}.": "如果角色们找到了所有的食材，Kaga会准备一顿适合英雄的盛宴。Jacque把一大盘Kaga的Stumblenoodles放在大圆桌中央，还有角色们想要的其他任何食物（你可以使用从{@i Heroes' Feast: Flavors of the Multiverse}中的菜肴来丰富酒馆的菜单）。来自达格福镇的许多孩子加入了盛宴。大家一起动筷享用。品尝了Stumblenoodles的角色们开始全身发麻。他们获得了{@reward Charm of the Stumblenoodle|HFStCM}。",
	"With dinner over, the characters are free to roam the Sword Coast. They might want to inform Arthur's siblings of his death. Perhaps, moved by Ignis's plight, they'll help her regain her rightful position among her people. They might even return to Holrow Homestead to investigate the mystery of its unusual fertility, potentially unleashing the awesome power of a {@creature Scion of Grolantor|BGG|hill giant scion}!": "晚餐结束后，角色们可以自由地在剑海岸漫游。他们可能想要通知亚瑟的兄弟姐妹他的死讯。也许，被伊格尼丝的困境所感动，他们会帮助她恢复在她人民中的合法地位。他们甚至可能返回霍尔罗农场，调查其异常肥沃的奥秘，潜在地释放出一个{@creature Scion of Grolantor|BGG|hill giant scion}的强大力量！",
	"The almanac is in Arthur's handwriting and contains a record of the weather over the last two years, a chart with the results of Arthur's experiments, and his notes.": "这本年鉴是由亚瑟亲笔写就的，其中包含了过去两年的天气记录、一张展示亚瑟实验结果的图表，以及他的笔记。",

	"Finally, nice, dry, and warm.": "终于，天气晴朗、干燥、温暖。",
	"It is important to rotate samples to the next shelf space every season to keep track of their age. Each season, I make a control sample from ordinary curds, an experimental sample not safe for consumption until further tests are conducted, and a salable sample from curds perfectly enhanced for peak flavor. To identify the effects of a season's conditions on each kind of sample, refer to the Cheese Sample Observations chart.": "每个季节都很重要地将样本转移到下一个货架空间，以便追踪它们的年龄。每个季节，我会从普通凝乳中制作一个对照样本，一个在进一步测试前不适合食用的实验样本，以及一个经过完美处理以获得最佳风味的凝乳可销售样本。要了解季节条件对每种样本的影响，请参考《奶酪样本观察》表。",
