	"You are about to embark on a great adventure that pits heroes against giants bent on reshaping the world. {@i Storm King's Thunder} is a Dungeons & Dragons adventure for four to six player characters. You can start the adventure with 1st-level characters or 5th-level characters. Either way, the characters should reach at least 11th level by the adventure's conclusion. Because giants figure prominently in the story, at least one character should be able to speak and understand the Giant language.": "你即将踏上一场伟大的冒险，让英雄们对抗一心想要重塑世界的巨人。{@i Storm King's Thunder}是一个龙与地下城的冒险，适合四到六个玩家角色。你可以用1级的角色或5级的角色开始冒险。无论哪种方式，角色在冒险结束时都应该达到至少11级。因为巨人在故事中占有重要地位，所以至少有一个角色应该能够说并理解巨人的语言。",
	"The adventure takes place in the Forgotten Realms, specifically in a region known as the Savage Frontier, in the northwest corner of the continent of Faerûn. Nonetheless, you can easily adapt the adventure to your home campaign by changing the names of various locations and factions.": "这场冒险发生在被遗忘的领域，特别是在法鲁恩大陆西北角的一个被称为野蛮人边境的地区。尽管如此，你可以通过改变不同地点和派别的名称，轻松地将这个冒险改编为你的家庭活动。",

	"The Savage Frontier (also known as the North) is a cold, rugged, sparsely populated land of snow-capped mountains, rocky hills, sprawling forests, and foggy vales. Isolated strongholds, ancient burial mounds, and the ruins of many forgotten empires dot this vast landscape. Bounded by the Sea of Swords to the west and the desert of Anauroch to the east, the Savage Frontier extends as far north as Icewind Dale and as far south as the town of Daggerford. Old roads stretch across this great expanse, linking the dwarven strongholds and mines in the mountains to the coastal settlements, frontier towns, and fortified outposts of humans and other folk. These roads are long, lonely, or poorly defended, making them dangerous to traverse. In fertile valleys, towns and cities have sprung up, separated by dozens if not hundreds of miles of untamed wilderness haunted by bandits, barbarians, and monsters.": "野蛮人边境（又称北方）是一片寒冷、崎岖、人烟稀少的土地，由雪山、岩石山、无垠的森林和多雾的山谷组成。孤立的堡垒、古老的坟冢和许多被遗忘的帝国的废墟点缀着这片广阔的土地。西边是剑海，东边是阿诺罗奇沙漠，野蛮人边境向北延伸到冰风谷，向南延伸到达格福特镇。古老的道路在这片广阔的土地上延伸，将山区的矮人据点和矿场与沿海的定居点、边境城镇以及人类和其他民族的坚固前哨连接起来。这些道路漫长、孤独，或者防守不力，使得它们在穿越时很危险。在肥沃的山谷中，城镇和城市如雨后春笋般涌现，它们之间隔着几十甚至几百英里的未开垦的荒野，那里有强盗、野蛮人和怪物出没。",
	"Evil dragons stirred into action by their dark queen, Tiamat, threatened the settlements of the Savage Frontier for a time. Ultimately, they were defeated and forced to withdraw to their lairs, while Tiamat was banished to the Nine Hells. Fear of the dragons' wrath has faded quickly with the coming of a new threat: giants. The peoples of the North are no strangers to giant incursions. Frost giants have long claimed the Spine of the World as their demesne, and hill giants are known to scrounge for food in the untamed hills. But now, in the past couple of months, giants of every kind have emerged from their strongholds in force to threaten civilization as never before—and not just frost giants and hill giants, but also stone giants, fire giants, and cloud giants. All of the giants are in an uproar. Reports of giant attacks throughout the North have reached the coastal cities of Luskan, Neverwinter, and Waterdeep, stoking fears that the giants are waging war against humans, dwarves, elves, and other small folk.": "被它们的黑暗女王提亚马特煽动起来的邪恶巨龙，曾一度威胁到野蛮边境的定居点。最终，它们被打败并被迫撤回它们的巢穴，而提亚马特被放逐到九层地狱。随着新威胁的到来，对龙的愤怒的恐惧迅速消退：巨人。北方的人民对巨人的入侵并不陌生。长期以来，冰霜巨人一直声称世界之脊是他们的领地，而山丘巨人也被称为在未被驯服的山丘上觅食。但现在，在过去的几个月里，各种类型的巨人都从他们的据点里出来，以前所未有的方式威胁着人类文明--不仅仅是冰霜巨人和山丘巨人，还有石巨人、火巨人和云巨人。所有的巨人都在骚动。关于整个北方的巨人攻击的报告已经传到了卢斯坎、永夜和水底的沿海城市，激起了人们对巨人正在对人类、矮人、精灵和其他小民发动战争的担忧。",
	"Giant society (such as it is) is defined in large part by the ordning, a caste system imposed upon the giants by their gods, chief among them Annam the All-Father. The ordning determines where a giant stands among his or her ilk. Traditionally, storm giants have stood at the top of the ordning. Tall and powerful, they struggle to keep the weaker races of giants from despoiling the realms of small folk and sparking conflict. The greatest storm giants are powerful seers, skilled at identifying and interpreting cosmic signs and divine omens. The aloof and aristocratic cloud giants, one step below the storm giants, rarely condescend to deal with lesser giants or small folk. Extravagance defines their culture and their place in the ordning. Below them are the tyrannical, warmongering fire giants and the merciless, predatory frost giants. Fire giants rank themselves by their forging skill, whereas frost giants rank themselves by their martial prowess. Near the bottom of the ordning are the xenophobic stone giants, who mostly live underground and regard the surface world as a realm of dreams. How well they sculpt stone determines their place among their peers. The lowest and smallest of the true giants are the hill giants, as gluttonous as they are loathsome. Hill giants are dullards who live in fear of their more powerful giant cousins. In hill giant society, the biggest rule.": "巨人社会（比如说）在很大程度上是由秩序决定的，这是一个由他们的神明强加给巨人的种姓制度，其中最主要的是全能之父安南。等级制度决定了一个巨人在他或她的同族中的地位。传统上，风暴巨人一直站在阶级的顶端。他们高大而强大，努力阻止弱小的巨人种族掠夺小民的领域并引发冲突。最伟大的风暴巨人是强大的预言家，善于识别和解释宇宙的迹象和神圣的预兆。冷漠而贵族化的云巨人，比风暴巨人低一级，很少屈尊与低等巨人或小民打交道。奢侈的生活决定了他们的文化和他们在军团中的地位。在他们之下是暴虐的、好战的火巨人和无情的、掠夺性的冰霜巨人。火巨人以他们的锻造技术为标准，而冰霜巨人则以他们的武艺为标准。靠近底层的是排外的石巨人，他们大多生活在地下，把地面世界看作是一个梦境。他们对石头的雕琢程度决定了他们在同龄人中的地位。真正的巨人中最低级和最小的是山丘巨人，他们既贪吃又令人厌恶。山地巨人是呆子，他们生活在对他们更强大的巨人表亲的恐惧之中。在山地巨人社会中，最大的统治者。",
	"Dragons are the ancient enemies of giants. Thousands of years ago, the last great empire of giants—Ostoria—fell after a long and brutal conflict with dragons. Little of Ostoria remains in what is now called the Savage Frontier. The civilizations of small folk have taken over the land once ruled by giants. Although evil giants make occasional forays into territory settled by small folk, their ambitions have long been curtailed by their lack of cohesion and the imposition of good-aligned storm giants and cloud giants whose memories of ancient, glorious Ostoria have faded over time.": "龙是巨人的古老敌人。几千年前，巨人的最后一个大帝国--奥斯托利亚--在与龙的漫长而残酷的冲突后灭亡。在现在被称为 \"野蛮人边境 \"的地方，奥斯托里亚的遗迹很少。小民的文明已经占领了曾经被巨人统治的土地。虽然邪恶的巨人偶尔会闯入小民定居的领土，但他们的野心早已被他们缺乏凝聚力和善意的风暴巨人和云层巨人的强加限制了，他们对古代辉煌的奥斯托利亚的记忆已经随着时间的推移而淡化。",
	"The recent efforts by dragons to bring Tiamat into the world (as told in the adventures {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} and {@i The Rise of Tiamat}) and the attempts by small folk to thwart them so upset the giant gods that Annam the All-Father shattered the ordning between the giants to break his \"children\" out of their complacency, pitting the six giant types against one another while keeping some semblance of order within each type. In so doing, Annam has spurred cloud, fire, frost, stone, and hill giants to challenge the established hierarchy and reforge their destiny. All the giants sensed the upheaval instantly, and now the giant types fiercely compete against one another, striving to create a new ordning through their deeds and accomplishments. These giants' calamitous endeavors have not only put the settlements of humans and other small folk in jeopardy but also attracted the attention of the giants' ancient enemies—the dragons—who will not abide the rise of another giant empire.": "最近，龙为将提亚马特带入世界所做的努力（如冒险故事{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}和{@i The Rise of Tiamat}中所述），以及小人物为挫败他们所做的尝试，使巨神们非常不满，全能之父安纳姆打破了巨人们之间的秩序，使他的 \"孩子们 \"不再自满，让六种类型的巨人互相对立，同时保持每种类型中某种秩序的样子。这样一来，安南就刺激了云、火、霜、石和山丘巨人去挑战既定的等级制度，重新塑造他们的命运。所有的巨人都立刻感觉到了这种动荡，现在各类型的巨人都在激烈地相互竞争，力争通过他们的行为和成就创造一个新的秩序。这些巨人的灾难性努力不仅使人类和其他小民的定居点处于危险之中，而且还吸引了巨人的古老敌人--龙的注意，它们不会容忍另一个巨人帝国的崛起。",
	"Small folk can only speculate as to the cause of the giants' unrest. It remains to be seen whether the old ordning between the giant types will be restored, or whether a new hierarchy will replace the old one, knocking the storm giants from their lofty perch.": "小民们只能猜测巨人动荡的原因。巨人类型之间的旧秩序是否会恢复，或者新的等级制度是否会取代旧的等级制度，将风暴巨人从其崇高的位置上打下来，我们拭目以待。",
	"For as long as Hekaton had reigned, fear of the king's wrath and respect for the ordning was enough to keep lesser giants from rising up against him. But in recent years, {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} had become convinced that the age of the giants was past, as evidenced by the growing distance between the giants and their gods. Annam the All-Father didn't answer prayers, and his divine offspring—the lesser giant gods—were out of touch, constantly waging war against one another on the Outer Planes. Hekaton came to believe that the giants were no longer the rightful masters of the world.": "在赫卡顿统治的这么长时间里，对国王的愤怒的恐惧和对法令的尊重足以让较小的巨人不起来反抗他。但近年来，{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}已经确信，巨人的时代已经过去了，巨人和他们的神之间的距离越来越远就是证明。全能之父安南（Annam the All-Father）不回应祈祷，他的神性后代--较小的巨神--失去了联系，不断地在外层星球上相互发动战争。赫卡顿开始相信，巨人不再是世界的合法主人了。",
	"Then, several months ago, Hekaton's fear became reality when the ordning was shattered. The king was profoundly shaken by the realization that storm giants might lose their apex status among giants. In the aftermath of the upheaval, he did his utmost to hold his court together, bullying weaker giants into submission.": "然后，几个月前，当法令被打破时，赫卡顿的恐惧成为现实。国王意识到风暴巨人可能会失去他们在巨人中的最高地位，因而受到了深深的震撼。在动荡之后，他尽最大努力来维持他的宫廷，欺负弱小的巨人，使他们屈服。",
	"Hekaton's wife, Queen Neri, was particularly fond of the small folk. She visited them often in the years before the ordning was sundered, rising up out of the sea to meet them on the shores of the Sword Coast. Neri continually urged her husband to respect the civilizations of the small folk and leave them alone, if he could not countenance forming alliances with them. Hekaton, inherently distrustful of the small folk, wanted nothing to do with them, but he respected his wife's desire to treat with them on occasion.": "赫卡顿的妻子，奈里女王，特别喜欢这些小民。在法令被废除之前的几年里，她经常拜访他们，从海中升起，在剑海岸边与他们会面。内里不断敦促她的丈夫尊重小民的文明，不要打扰他们，如果他不能忍受与他们结成联盟。赫卡顿本来就不信任小民，不想和他们有任何瓜葛，但他尊重他妻子的愿望，偶尔和他们交往。",
	"{@creature Mirran|SKT} and {@creature Nym|SKT} abided by his decision, but nevertheless their unhappiness was clear. Secretly, they blamed their mother for persuading their father to pass them over. Their blame was unfounded, in fact; Queen Neri had actually warned her husband against making any such pronouncement. {@creature Mirran|SKT} and {@creature Nym|SKT} seethed inside but were too terrified of their father to do anything, until a recent arrival to Maelstrom named {@creature Iymrith|SKT} wormed her way into Hekaton's court and goaded them into action.": "{@creature Mirran|SKT}和{@creature Nym|SKT}遵守了他的决定，但尽管如此，他们的不快乐是显而易见的。他们暗地里责怪他们的母亲劝说他们的父亲放弃他们。事实上，他们的责备是毫无根据的；内里王后实际上已经警告过她的丈夫不要做出任何这样的宣告。{@creature Mirran|SKT}和{@creature Nym|SKT}内心愤怒，但对他们的父亲太害怕了，什么都不敢做，直到最近一个叫{@creature Iymrith|SKT}的人来到漩涡镇，蠕动着进入赫卡顿的宫廷，促使他们行动起来。",
	"The elder sisters, acting in accordance with {@creature Iymrith|SKT}'s counsel, are responsible for both Neri's death and Hekaton's disappearance. {@creature Mirran|SKT} and {@creature Nym|SKT} got their revenge against Neri by plotting—with {@creature Iymrith|SKT}'s help—to have her assassinated. Then they urged their father to hunt down the small folk who killed their mother and fed him false information on the whereabouts of the assassins, to throw the king off track and put him in peril.": "大姐们按照{@creature Iymrith|SKT}的建议行事，对奈里的死和赫卡顿的失踪都负有责任。{@creature Mirran|SKT}和{@creature Nym|SKT}通过谋划--在{@creature Iymrith|SKT}的帮助下--暗杀了奈里，为她报了仇。然后，他们怂恿他们的父亲追捕杀害他们母亲的小人物，并向他提供关于刺客下落的虚假信息，以使国王偏离轨道，使他处于危险之中。",
	"In the wake of Hekaton's disappearance, turmoil engulfed his court. After nearly a month of waiting for him to come back, {@creature Serissa|SKT} reluctantly claimed her father's throne at {@creature Imperator Uthor|SKT}'s urging.": "在赫卡顿失踪后，他的宫廷陷入了动荡之中。在等待他回来的近一个月后，{@creature Serissa|SKT}在{@creature Imperator Uthor|SKT}的催促下，不情愿地认领了她父亲的王位。",
	"{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}'s eldest daughter, {@creature Mirran|SKT}, is a spoiled brat with the forcefulness and unpredictability of a typhoon. She covets the power of the {@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT} and believes it rightfully belongs to her. She is angry with her parents for placing {@creature Serissa|SKT} next in the line of succession, and she has made her feelings plain. {@creature Mirran|SKT} believes she is destined to rule and has seen signs that reinforce her belief. Once she claims the throne, {@creature Mirran|SKT} expects all other giants to kneel before her. She plans to use her newfound power to resurrect the ancient empire of Ostoria, sweeping away the cities and kingdoms of the small folk.": "{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}的长女{@creature Mirran|SKT}是个被宠坏的孩子，有着台风般的强势和不可预测。她觊觎{@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}的权力，认为它理应属于她。她对父母将{@creature Serissa|SKT}安排在继承人行列中感到愤怒，她已经把自己的感受说得很清楚。{@creature Mirran|SKT}认为她注定要统治，并看到了加强其信念的迹象。一旦她登上王位，{@creature Mirran|SKT}希望所有其他巨人都能在她面前下跪。她计划用她新发现的力量来复活古老的奥斯托利亚帝国，扫除小民的城市和王国。",
	"If {@creature Mirran|SKT} is the blustery gale of an ocean storm, then {@creature Nym|SKT} is the undercurrent. {@creature King Hekaton|SKT}'s middle child is cold and calculating. She has always felt neglected by her parents, in part because {@creature Mirran|SKT} was so demanding and {@creature Serissa|SKT} so young. In truth, {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} and Queen Neri loved {@creature Nym|SKT} as much as they adored their other daughters, but they found her distant and difficult to please. {@creature Nym|SKT} wants {@creature Mirran|SKT} to seize the throne—and then, when {@creature Mirran|SKT} makes enemies at every turn and proves to everyone that she is unfit to rule, {@creature Nym|SKT} plans to supplant her. She has received omens that support her bid for power. Unlike her blustery older sister, {@creature Nym|SKT} is worried about the consequences of the dissolution of the ordning. Nonetheless, {@creature Iymrith|SKT} has convinced her that she has an important destiny to fulfill, and that the gods will reward her if she brings about the return of Ostoria.": "如果{@creature Mirran|SKT}是海洋风暴的狂风，那么{@creature Nym|SKT}就是暗流。{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}的中间孩子很冷漠，很有心计。她一直觉得自己被父母忽视了，部分原因是{@creature Mirran|SKT}要求太高，{@creature Serissa|SKT}太年轻。事实上，{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}和内里王后对{@creature Nym|SKT}的爱和他们对其他女儿的爱一样多，但他们发现她很遥远，难以取悦。{@creature Nym|SKT}想让{@creature Mirran|SKT}夺取王位--然后，当{@creature Mirran|SKT}处处树敌，向所有人证明她不适合统治时，{@creature Nym|SKT}计划取代她。她已经收到了支持她争夺权力的预兆。与她那虚张声势的姐姐不同，{@creature Nym|SKT}担心法令解体的后果。尽管如此，{@creature Iymrith|SKT}已经说服了她，她有一个重要的命运要完成，如果她能使奥斯托利亚回归，诸神会奖励她。",
	"{@creature Serissa|SKT} values the counsel of her advisors, but she has her own mind. She wants to see her faith—and her mother's faith—in the small folk vindicated, so she leaps at any opportunity to use small folk to find her father, who she believes has the power to set things right. She is hoping for a cosmic sign to validate her beliefs, but time is not on her side.": "{@creature Serissa|SKT}重视她的顾问们的建议，但她有自己的想法。她希望看到她的信仰--以及她母亲对小民的信仰得到平反，所以她抓住任何机会，利用小民找到她的父亲，她相信父亲有能力纠正一切。她希望有一个宇宙标志来验证她的信仰，但时间不在她这边。",
	"{@creature Iymrith|SKT} is an ancient blue dragon who can assume the form of a storm giant. In this guise, she has infiltrated Hekaton's court. While concealing her true nature and agenda from the giants, {@creature Iymrith|SKT} offers counsel to Princess {@creature Serissa|SKT} and at the same time secretly feeds the anger and jealousy of {@creature Serissa|SKT}'s older siblings, with the ultimate goal of thrusting the giants into war with the small folk. The dragon also wants to wrest the {@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT} from the storm giants and add it to her trove.": "{@creature Iymrith|SKT}是一条古老的蓝龙，可以化身为风暴巨人。在这个伪装下，她已经潜入了赫卡顿的宫廷。在向巨人隐瞒她的真实本性和目的的同时，{@creature Iymrith|SKT}向公主{@creature Serissa|SKT}提供建议，同时暗中助长{@creature Serissa|SKT}兄妹的愤怒和嫉妒，最终目的是将巨人推入与小民的战争。这条龙还想从风暴巨人那里夺取{@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}，并将其加入自己的宝库。",
	"The disguised dragon put {@creature Mirran|SKT} and {@creature Nym|SKT} in contact with representatives of {@creature Slarkrethel|SKT}, a legendary kraken that haunts the Trackless Sea. These small folk belong to a secret yet widespread organization called the Kraken Society. Using information given to them by the evil storm giant sisters, Kraken Society operatives ambushed and killed Queen Neri. {@creature Iymrith|SKT} then planted rumors in the storm giant court that the queen had been assassinated by the Lords' Alliance, a confederacy of cities and settlements populated by small folk and scattered throughout the North.

The nobles of House Nandar had a hunting lodge in the forest two centuries ago, but elves forced them to abandon it. Ten years ago, members of House Nandar—Lord Drezlin Nandar and Lady Velrosa Nandar—decided it was time to return. They built a new motte-and-bailey settlement south of the Ardeep Forest and began making forays into the woods with friends to hunt and explore. Unknown to the Nandars, wood elves from Evermeet then settled in the forest, determined to protect the remnants of old elf empires from plunder and desecration. As in the past, the interests of the elves and Nandars were at cross purposes. A year ago, the conflict came to a head, and the elves attacked Nightstone. Drezlin was among the many slain—shot and killed by elf arrows while standing on the roof of his keep. His widow, Lady Velrosa Nandar, made peace with the elves and promised to make no further incursions into the Ardeep Forest—a promise she kept for the rest of her life.

	"Sirac knows that he's a son of the immortal Artus Cimber and thus carries the Cimber bloodline, not that it has ever benefited him. Artus's immortality, it is said, comes from a magic ring—a ring that Sirac has never seen. Sirac's parents gave him up as a baby; he was raised in an orphanage and learned his survival skills as a teenager living on the streets of Suzail. He traveled west with a caravan to Baldur's Gate, then sailed up the Sword Coast to Neverwinter. He came to Icewind Dale three months ago to try his hand at knucklehead trout fishing, and ended up befriending Dellvon Ludwig. Sirac has since come to appreciate Torm's mantra, espousing courage and heroism above all.": "西拉克知道他是不朽的阿图斯-辛伯的儿子，因此带有辛伯的血统，但这对他来说并没有什么好处。据说，阿图斯的不死之身来自一枚魔戒--一枚西拉克从未见过的戒指。西拉克的父母在他还是个婴儿时就把他抛弃了；他在孤儿院长大，十几岁时在苏泽尔的街头学会了生存技能。他随一个商队向西走到博德之门，然后沿着剑海岸航行到永夜。三个月前，他来到冰风谷，想试试自己钓鳟鱼的手艺，结果结识了戴尔文-路德维格。此后，西拉克开始欣赏托尔姆的咒语，崇尚勇气和英雄主义高于一切。",
	"The Speaker's Palace is the private residence of the town speaker. The \"palace\" part of its name is an overstatement, compared to such buildings elsewhere in the world.

At the same time, its taproom is the best place in all of Ten-Towns to get the latest news and rumors, including leads on profitable ventures. The proprietor, a retired sellsword who goes by the name Scramsax (N male Illuskan human {@creature veteran}), takes advantage of the high hopes and good fortunes of his customers by charging the most exorbitant rates in town. (His prices for room and board are double those listed in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB|4}.)

	"One of the oldest inns in town, Geldenstag's Rest is run by Myrtle (LN female Illuskan human noncombatant), a gray-haired widow. Myrtle makes it her business to know everyone else's business, asking her guests a lot of questions about what they're up to each day. The inn's accommodations are lackluster—the small rooms are furnished with only a stool, a chamber pot, and two cots with dirty furs thrown over them. It might seem the kind of place that would attract lowlifes and troublemakers, but Myrtle's pestering tends to drive away people who have secrets to keep. The absence of that element from its clientele makes Geldenstag's Rest a popular destination for travelers who aren't looking for too much excitement during their stay in Bryn Shander.": "Geldenstag's Rest是镇上最古老的旅馆之一，由Myrtle（LN女性Illuskan人类非战斗人员）经营，她是一个灰头发的寡妇。桃金娘把了解别人的事当作自己的事，每天都会问客人很多问题，问他们在做什么。旅店的住宿条件很差--小房间里只有一张凳子、一个锅和两张扔在上面的脏毛皮的小床。它似乎是那种会吸引低等生物和麻烦制造者的地方，但默特尔的纠缠往往会赶走那些有秘密要保守的人。客人中没有这种因素，使得格登斯塔格的休息处成为那些在布林山德逗留期间不寻求太多刺激的旅行者的热门目的地。",

If her demands aren't met immediately, Drufi uses the horn to signal the other frost giants, who advance to within 100 feet of the town and begin hurling rocks over the walls, not targeting anyone or anything specifically but looking to cause widespread panic. As townsfolk take cover, Drufi and her two giant bodyguards try to break down the southwest gate and fight their way inside. While this is happening, a young man named Sirac at the House of the Triad learns what the giants are after and realizes he might be able to save the town.": "德鲁菲携带一个由猛犸象牙制成的号角，并可将其作为一项行动吹响。喇叭的声音可以传到一英里的范围内。如果她的要求没有立即得到满足，德鲁菲会用号角向其他冰霜巨人发出信号，他们前进到离镇子100英尺的范围内，开始向墙上投掷石块，不是专门针对任何人或任何东西，而是希望引起广泛的恐慌。当镇民们躲避时，德鲁菲和她的两个巨人保镖试图打破西南门，并在里面拼杀。在这一过程中，三合会之家的一个名叫西拉克的年轻人得知了巨人的目的，并意识到他可能能够拯救这个小镇。",

Called \"the Granary of the North,\" it's the only reason many Northerners ever taste soft-fleshed fruit larger than bush berries. Waterdeep and its neighbors consume the temple's reliable output: carefully husbanded grains and dried, oil-packed, or salted foodstuffs preserved in vast storage cellars, vats, and squat stone grain-towers.": "Goldenfields是一个巨大的、有围墙的寺庙农场，供奉农业女神Chauntea。它被称为 \"北方的粮仓\"，是许多北方人品尝比灌木浆果更大的软肉水果的唯一原因。沃特迪普和它的邻居们消费着神庙的可靠产出：精心饲养的谷物和干燥的、油包的或盐渍的食品，保存在巨大的储藏室、大桶和蹲式石制谷物塔里。",
	"Run by Abbot Ellardin Darovik, Goldenfields is a stronghold of the Emerald Enclave. Members of that faction are as welcome here as clergy of Chauntea; many of them stay for months at a time to help with the work and the vigilant defense of the farm against insects and blights, as well as would-be vandals and plunderers. Hired guards and adventurers patrol the walls and the land immediately around them. Inside the farm, young treants allied with the Emerald Enclave hide within stands of trees, ready to animate trees to repel invaders. More than five thousand people live and work in Goldenfields year round, farming more than twenty square miles of tillage in gangs of hard-working gardeners.": "由Ellardin Darovik院长管理，Goldenfields是翡翠飞地的一个据点。该派系的成员在这里和Chauntea的神职人员一样受到欢迎；他们中的许多人在这里一呆就是几个月，帮助工作，并警惕地保护农场免受昆虫和瘟疫以及可能的破坏者和掠夺者的侵害。雇佣的卫兵和冒险家在城墙和周围的土地上巡逻。在农场内，与翡翠飞地结盟的年轻树人躲在树丛中，准备用树木的生命力来击退入侵者。超过五千人常年生活和工作在Goldenfields，在辛勤工作的园丁团伙中耕种着超过20平方英里的耕地。",
	"The sprawling temple-farm is built on higher ground than the surrounding fields, and it's enclosed on all sides by a wall of mortared stone. The outer wall is 60 feet high (20 feet high inside the compound) and 30 feet wide. The wall is built out at several points, spaced at least a mile apart, with stone pagodas and barracks at those locations.

	"The entrance to Goldenfields is a large stone gatehouse set into the middle of the south wall. Beyond its gates, dirt roads crisscross the interior of the compound, providing passage between and through its fields and orchards. Roads also run along the inside of the wall, connecting the various watch posts. During the harvest season, wagons make their way between the fields, gathering food and grain and transporting it to cellars beneath the watch posts, where the food is kept under lock and key until caravans from Waterdeep and other settlements arrive to pick it up. In addition to the large grain fields, fruit orchards, and vegetable gardens, smaller gardens hug the outer walls. These gardens grow berries, rhubarb plants, and other such fare.": "金田园的入口是一个大的石头门楼，镶嵌在南墙的中间。在门外，土路纵横交错，为田地和果园之间提供通道。道路也沿着城墙内侧运行，连接各个观察站。在收获季节，马车在田地之间穿梭，收集食物和谷物，并将其运送到哨所下面的地窖里，在那里，食物被锁住，直到来自沃特迪普和其他定居点的商队来取走它们。除了大型粮田、果园和菜园之外，小型花园也紧紧围绕着外墙。这些花园种植浆果、大黄植物和其他类似的食物。",

	"At more or less regular intervals around the perimeter of Goldenfields, the outer wall (which is 60 feet high on the outside and 20 feet high on the inside) widens to accommodate broad stone parapets with buildings atop them. Each parapet features a 30-foot-tall stone pagoda topped by a weather vane. A wooden statue of Chauntea stands in the middle of each pagoda, holding a large bronze gong and surrounded by cornucopias. Next to each pagoda are one or two stone outbuildings that serve as barracks. A 10-foot-wide, moss-covered stone staircase leads from the top of the parapet down to the compound. A set of locked, ironbound wooden doors at ground level provide access to storerooms and cellars located underneath each watch post.

Any other watch posts within that range ring their gongs as well, putting more of the compound on alert.": "看守所相距甚远，喊叫报警是无效的。如果一个哨所需要发出警报，一名守卫就会跑到宝塔前，用一个沉重的木槌敲打锣鼓。宝塔的设计可以放大声音，使每面锣的响声在两英里外都能听到。在这个范围内的任何其他哨所也会敲响他们的锣，使更多的院落处于警戒状态。",
	"The watch posts were designed to warn Goldenfields of approaching armies and dragons. Even though the watch posts and the wall patrols provide a great measure of security, a small group of invaders could scale the outer wall and enter the compound undetected if they were lucky enough to avoid the notice of the guards.": "观察哨是为了警告金地的军队和龙的接近。尽管哨所和城墙巡逻提供了很大的安全保障，但如果一小群入侵者幸运地避开守卫的注意，他们可以翻越外墙，进入院落而不被发现。",

A handful of guards confront the two foolish giants, but they retreat once Lob and Ogg start breaking off and hurling wall battlements (treat as hurled rocks).

	"The Savage Frontier, or the North, is a harsh and untamed wilderness dotted with fortified settlements and the lairs of terrible monsters.

Grim dwarfholds, tribes of fierce barbarians, and half-legendary elf realms might stand for a short time, but none are destined to last. An orc horde or a flight of dragons could sweep them all away tomorrow, leaving nothing but mile upon unmapped mile of wilderness.": "野蛮的边疆，或者说北方，是一个严酷的、未被驯服的荒野，点缀着坚固的定居点和可怕怪物的巢穴。在数百个关于危险和困难的令人毛骨悚然的故事中，北方被描绘成一个广阔、寒冷和无法无天的领域，它藐视所有使其文明化的企图。严峻的矮人家庭、凶猛的野蛮人部落和半传奇的精灵王国可能会在短时间内屹立不倒，但没有一个是注定要持久的。兽人部落或龙的飞行可以在明天将它们全部扫除，只留下一英里又一英里的未开发的荒野。",
	"The Savage Frontier lies between the Sword Coast and the desert of Anauroch, extending as far north as Icewind Dale and as far south as the city of Waterdeep.

Here, too, can be found the wealth of history—the plunder of lost civilizations such as Illefarn and Eaerlann, the ancient kingdoms of the gold elves; Delzoun, a long-buried nation of dungeon-dwelling dwarves; and Netheril, a fallen empire of human spellcasters. Throughout the Savage Frontier lie the ruins and dungeons of these and other \"forgotten realms.\" Cities such as Waterdeep, Mirabar, and Neverwinter would like to claim this wealth and knowledge for themselves, but enforcing such claims is next to impossible.

	"Humans are the most widespread of the civilized races, but no unified human nation exists in the North—only individual cities, towns, villages, fiefdoms, farmsteads, fortresses, and outposts connected to one another by long, mostly unprotected rivers and roads. Human settlements rely on various industries for survival. For example, most of the humans of Ten-Towns and Port Llast are fishers, the humans of Mirabar and Leilon are primarily miners, and the humans who live in Beliard, Triboar, and other settlements of the central Dessarin Valley are mostly farmers. Coastal cities such as Waterdeep, Luskan, and Neverwinter—as well as riverside cities such as Yartar, Everlund, and Silverymoon—are home to human traders, shipbuilders, and artisans.": "人类是最广泛的文明种族，但在北方没有统一的人类国家，只有个别的城市、城镇、村庄、封地、农庄、堡垒和前哨，通过长长的、大部分没有保护的河流和道路相互连接。人类定居点依靠各种行业生存。例如，Ten-Towns和Port Llast的大部分人类是渔民，Mirabar和Leilon的人类主要是矿工，而居住在Beliard、Triboar和Dessarin山谷中部其他定居点的人类大多是农民。沿海城市如沃特迪普（Waterdeep）、卢斯坎（Luskan）和永夜（Neverwinter），以及河边城市如亚尔塔（Yartar）、埃弗伦（Everlund）和银月（Silverymoon）都是人类商人、造船师和工匠的家园。",
	"Although each city of the North enjoys and maintains its independence, all these communities are at risk of being overrun by the monstrous threats that live outside their walls. Fear of the wilderness and its many terrors led to the formation of the Lords' Alliance, a loose confederacy of human-dominated settlements built on mutually beneficial trade agreements and a willingness to seek out and destroy threats to civilization. Members of the Lords' Alliance include the cities of Waterdeep, Neverwinter, Mirabar, Yartar, and Silverymoon, as well as the towns of Amphail, Daggerford, and Longsaddle and the dwarfhold of Mithral Hall.

	"Within the settlements of the North, one can find humans, dwarves, elves, and other civilized races commingling more or less peacefully. Waterdeep, in particular, is a melting pot of races from all over Faerûn. Outside these communities, however, people have much less tolerance for other races, as folk tend to feel safer among their own kind. Small towns and villages dominated by humans tend to have few if any nonhumans, with most dwarves, elves, and halflings preferring to live in their own settlements, far from human-claimed lands. In generations past, most human settlers of the North were fair-haired and light-skinned. Since then, the riches and promise of the Savage Frontier have attracted distant foreigners, and several generations of cultural intermingling have given the humans of the North much more diversity in their appearance (see \"{@race human||Human Names and Ethnicities}\" in {@book chapter 2|PHB|1} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}).": "在北方的定居点内，人们可以发现人类、矮人、精灵和其他文明种族或多或少地和平共处。尤其是水底城，是来自法鲁恩各地的种族的大熔炉。然而，在这些社区之外，人们对其他种族的容忍度要低得多，因为人们倾向于在自己的同类中感到更安全。由人类主导的小城镇和村庄往往很少有非人类，大多数矮人、精灵和半身人喜欢住在自己的定居点，远离人类的土地。在过去的几代人中，北方的大多数人类定居者都是白发和浅色皮肤。从那时起，野蛮边境的财富和前景吸引了遥远的外国人，几代人的文化交融使北方的人类在外表上更加多样化（见{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的\"{@race human||Human Names and Ethnicities}\"）。",

They refer to one of several tall, fair-haired, seagoing peoples that ply the cold northern waters and dwell on the islands of the west, including Tuern, Gundarlun, Ruathym, the Purple Rocks, and the Korinn Archipelago. Northfolk ancestors built small villages along the Sword Coast that have since become cities, including fabled Illusk (now Luskan), Eigersstor (now Neverwinter), and Nimoar's Hold (now Waterdeep). These early Northlanders farmed the rocky coastlines, fished coastal waters, and hunted seals and whales on the open sea. A few clans of Northlanders explored the monster-infested interior of the Savage Frontier, and they became the ancestors of the Uthgardt tribes and the present-day denizens of Icewind Dale.": "北方人、Northfolk和Northmen这三个词是可以互换的。他们指的是几个高大、白发的航海民族之一，他们在寒冷的北方水域航行，居住在西部的岛屿上，包括图恩、贡达伦、鲁阿西姆、紫岩和科林群岛。诺斯福克人的祖先在剑海岸建立了一些小村庄，这些村庄后来都变成了城市，包括传说中的伊鲁斯克（现在的卢斯坎）、艾格斯托尔（现在的永冬）和尼莫尔之城（现在的沃特迪普）。这些早期的北地人在岩石海岸线上耕种，在沿海水域捕鱼，并在公海上猎取海豹和鲸鱼。有几个北地人的部族探索了野蛮边境的怪物泛滥的内部，他们成为了乌斯加德部落和今天冰风谷居民的祖先。",
	"Northlanders farm, fish, and mine their rugged lands, then shrewdly trade their goods with foreign buyers. Many once-feared tribes have become merchants whose bartering skills are equal to or better than the warlike talents of their ancestors, such that many a Northlander merchant is wealthier than their raiding neighbors.": "北方人在他们崎岖的土地上耕种、捕鱼和采矿，然后精明地与外国买家交易他们的货物。许多曾经害怕的部落已经成为商人，他们的易货贸易技能等同于或优于他们祖先的好战才能，因此许多北地人的商人比他们的突袭邻居更富有。",

Markedly taller than most southerners, with some males approaching seven feet in height, Reghed barbarians have blue eyes and hair of blond, red, or light brown. Their skin is bronzed from the sun and cracked by the wind, giving their faces the look of tough leather set in an expressionless mask. They dress in leather and furs. At one time, scores of Reghed tribes roamed the frozen north. Now, due to wars with orcs and battles against their own kind, not to mention the encroachment of civilization, only four Reghed tribes remain. They follow herds of reindeer on the animals' annual migrations, moving southwest in the winter and northeast in the summer. The barbarians live in large, round tents made of deerskin and supported by beams of wood or whalebone.": "冰风谷的冰冻苔原是游牧的雷格德野蛮人的家园。他们因雷格德冰川而得名，该冰川在他们领地的东部边界形成一道高耸的冰墙。雷格德野蛮人明显比大多数南方人高，有些男性身高接近7英尺，他们有蓝色的眼睛和金色、红色或浅棕色的头发。他们的皮肤被太阳晒成古铜色，被风吹得干裂，使他们的脸看起来就像镶嵌在无表情面具中的坚硬皮革。他们穿着皮革和毛皮的衣服。曾几何时，几十个瑞格德部落在冰冷的北方游荡。现在，由于与兽人的战争和与同类的战斗，更不用说文明的侵袭，只剩下四个瑞格德部落。他们每年跟随驯鹿群迁徙，冬季向西南方向移动，夏季向东北方向移动。野蛮人住在用鹿皮制成的大圆帐篷里，由木头或鲸骨的横梁支撑。",
	"In the past, the Reghed tribes were known to raid Ten-Towns for supplies, but now the Tribe of the Elk is learning to live in peace with the more civilized people of Ten-Towns. The other three Reghed tribes—the Tribe of the Tiger, the Tribe of the Wolf, and the Tribe of the Bear—are more likely to attack one another than to threaten their more civilized neighbors, fighting over sustenance at the risk of their own extinction.": "在过去，Reghed部落以突袭Ten-Towns的物资而闻名，但现在麋鹿部落正在学习与Ten-Towns更文明的人们和平共处。其他三个雷格德部落--虎部落、狼部落和熊部落--更有可能相互攻击，而不是威胁他们更文明的邻居，他们为了生计而争斗，不惜自己灭亡。",
	"A single Reghed tribe is made up of small clans scattered throughout Icewind Dale, each with its own chieftain. The chieftains choose the most powerful among them to be their king or queen—the one around whom others rally in times of crisis. When a monarch dies, the tribe's chieftains gather to choose a new one. Disputes over who should be named king or queen are resolved through trials by nonlethal combat. Without a unifying leader, a Reghed tribe is more fractured and vulnerable to its enemies. Thus, chieftains are motivated to name one among them who rules above all. A chieftain who becomes king or queen wears that mantle for life.": "一个Reghed部落是由分散在冰风谷的小部族组成的，每个部族都有自己的酋长。酋长们选择其中最强大的人作为他们的国王或女王--在危机时刻，其他人都会团结在他周围。当君主去世时，部落的首领们会聚在一起选择新的君主。关于谁应该被任命为国王或王后的争议通过非致命战斗的审判来解决。如果没有一个统一的领袖，Reghed部落就会更加支离破碎，容易受到敌人的攻击。因此，酋长们都想在他们中间指定一个人统治所有的人。成为国王或王后的酋长会终身戴着这顶帽子。",

The kings and queens of the other tribes would see the Tribe of the Wolf obliterated, but the Wolf King and his followers are adept at avoiding the traps set for them by their rivals.": "雷格德野蛮人憎恨兽人，熊部落、麋鹿部落和虎部落将抛开部落间的争斗来消灭他们。这些部落还将联合起来对抗白龙和冰霜巨人，因为这些生物威胁着冰风谷的食物供应。狼部落及其疯狂的国王Isarr Kronenstrom不与其他部落结盟--他们是如此的凶恶和嗜血，以至于无法接近。其他部落的国王和女王希望看到狼部落被消灭，但狼王和他的追随者善于避开对手为他们设置的陷阱。",
	"One of the Bear tribe's two remaining chieftains, Wolvig Barrundson, recently fell under the sway of evil and formed an alliance with a supernatural entity known as the Ice Witch.

	"Weakened by conflict, the Tribe of the Wolf was without a king or queen for three winters. Its most powerful chieftain, Isarr Kronenstrom, is a bloodthirsty tyrant who worships Malar the Beast-Lord. He hunts Ten-Towners for sport and strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies, many of whom believe he's the Chosen of Malar. Several members of Isarr's clan have deserted him or been killed off by rival tribes, but the few that remain are fiercely loyal, Though Isarr's clan has dwindled in recent years, the other Wolf chieftains fear Isarr and are too weak to challenge him.

	"The history of the North is replete with tales of orc hordes spilling out of the mountains to attack the mines, ranches, farmsteads, and settlements of other folk. These orcs hear the call of Gruumsh, the one-eyed god of slaughter, and must satisfy his hunger for carnage lest he visit ruin upon them. When a particularly strong orc chieftain unites multiple clans under one banner, the resulting horde typically rampages across the land, laying waste to strongholds and slaughtering other creatures in its path. Reghed and Uthgardt clans usually put aside their territorial rivalries to oppose and destroy a rampaging orc horde. Settlements throughout the North form their own coalitions to combat rampaging orcs, with mixed results. The War of the Silver Marches (1484–1485 DR), the latest such conflict, saw orcs fighting alongside white dragons and frost giants.

Harbromm's twin sons, Bromm and Harnoth, inherited the throne and, like their father, left Citadel Adbar to join the war. Bromm later perished, leaving the crown to Harnoth.

The decision was touted as an opportunity for Everlund to chart its own course, but more educated citizens believe the vote was orchestrated by the Zoar family, a group of influential nobles that moved to Everlund from Waterdeep over a century ago amid some scandal.

The Zhentarim also laid claim to the gold and silver mines in the nearby hills and utterly depleted them, all the while fighting off Grayvale militias attempting to recapture the town.": "人类和矮人探矿者在灰流河的东岸建立了采矿镇Llorkh。当镇特人第一次开始沿着黑路通过阿瑙罗奇进行贸易时，他们征服了洛尔克，将其作为在北方的一个立足点。镇特人还对附近山上的金矿和银矿提出了要求，并将其彻底耗尽，同时击退了试图夺回该镇的灰谷民兵。",
	"After the mines were tapped out, the Zhents packed up and left the town in ruins. Llorkh later became a bandit lord's stronghold until that villain was finally dispatched. Most recently, an attempt to rebuild Llorkh had just gotten under way when the stone giants of Deadstone Cleft attacked. The residents were driven out, and the giants have begun dismantling the town stone by stone in an effort to erase it from the surface world.": "矿场被开采完毕后，Zhents夫妇收拾行李，将小镇变成了废墟。Llorkh后来成为一个强盗领主的据点，直到这个恶棍最终被赶走。最近，重建Llorkh的尝试刚刚开始，就遭到了死石谷的石巨人的攻击。居民们被赶了出来，巨人开始一块一块地拆解小镇，试图将它从地表世界抹去。",

	"The aptly named Lonely Moor is a desolate, dusty waste of scrub and rock that stretches from the desert of Anauroch to the Forgotten Forest and the foothills of the Graypeak Mountains.": "命名为 \"孤独荒原 \"的地方是一片荒凉的、布满灰尘的灌木和岩石的废墟，从阿瑙罗克的沙漠延伸到被遗忘的森林和灰峰山的山脚。",
	"The Long Road, one of the North's busiest trade routes, begins at the gates of Mirabar and continues for hundreds of miles southward through the Dessarin Valley, meeting the High Road just north of Waterdeep. Many towns and villages lie along the route and depend on the relative safety that the Long Road provides for caravans and other travelers. Unfortunately for those travelers, the road is far too long to be defended properly along its entire length, and attacks by bandits, barbarians, and monsters are all too frequent in some areas.": "长路是北方最繁忙的贸易路线之一，从米拉巴尔的大门开始，向南延伸数百英里，穿过德萨林谷，在沃特迪普的北面与大路相遇。沿途有许多城镇和村庄，依靠长路为商队和其他旅行者提供的相对安全。对这些旅行者来说，不幸的是，这条路太长了，无法在整个路段上进行适当的防御，在一些地区，强盗、野蛮人和怪物的攻击太频繁了。",
	"This sleepy little frontier village and member of the Lords' Alliance straddles the Long Road, with rows of homes and businesses on either side of the trade route. Noteworthy establishments include a rustic inn called the Gilded Horseshoe and a friendly festhall called the Gambling Golem, where card games and a local marbles game known as scattershields are popular. Off in the distance, one can see horses and herds of cattle on sprawling ranches.": "这个沉睡的边境小村庄和领主联盟的成员横跨长路，在贸易路线的两边有一排排的房屋和企业。值得一提的机构包括一家名为 \"镀金马蹄 \"的乡村旅馆和一家名为 \"赌神 \"的友好会所，这里流行纸牌游戏和一种被称为 \"散弹 \"的当地弹珠游戏。在远处，人们可以看到马匹和成群的牛群在广阔的牧场上。",
	"Monsters or brigands sometimes mistake Longsaddle for easy pickings—unaware that a family of powerful human wizards, the Harpells, lives nearby. Their grand house, Ivy Mansion, lies west of Longsaddle at the end of a long, winding path. The Harpells founded the village but take no part in its government, preferring to live quietly on their estate. Magical wards placed throughout Longsaddle and the Ivy Mansion warn the Harpells when trouble's afoot.": "怪物或强盗有时会误以为Longsaddle是个好地方--不知道附近住着一个强大的人类巫师家族--哈佩尔家族。他们的大房子，常春藤大厦，位于龙须沟以西，在一条长长的蜿蜒小路的尽头。哈珀尔家族建立了这个村子，但不参与村子的管理，他们更愿意安静地生活在他们的庄园里。当有麻烦发生时，放置在Longsaddle和常春藤大厦的魔法防护装置会警告哈珀尔夫妇。",

	"With Zelbross, Orlbar, and Llorkh in ruins, Loudwater is the last bastion of civilization in the Delimbiyr Vale east of Secomber. If the town is worried, it doesn't show it. Loudwater provides a welcome respite for weary caravan and riverboat drivers, not to mention adventurers. It lies on both sides of the Delimbiyr River, the two halves linked by an arching stone overpass built by dwarves to honor the elves. Ancient wards placed on the overpass to preserve it had an unintended magical side effect: river trout attempting to swim under the bridge are propelled over it instead, which is why locals refer to it as the Flying Fish Bridge. People crossing the bridge are occasionally struck by these fish, which deal no damage. Whenever a fish hits a traveler and flops onto the bridge, it's a local custom (and considered good luck) to toss the fish back into the river.": "随着泽尔布罗斯、奥尔巴和洛尔克成为废墟，劳德沃特是塞康伯以东德林拜尔谷地的最后一个文明堡垒。如果该镇有忧虑，它也不会表现出来。劳德沃特为疲惫的商队和河船司机提供了一个受欢迎的休息场所，更不用说冒险者了。它位于德林拜尔河的两岸，两半由矮人建造的拱形石桥连接，以纪念精灵。为了保护立交桥，古代的防护措施有一个意外的魔法副作用：试图从桥下游过的河鳟鱼被推到桥上，这就是为什么当地人把它称为飞鱼桥。过桥的人偶尔会被这些鱼撞到，但它们不会造成任何伤害。每当有鱼撞到旅行者并翻到桥上时，当地的习俗是把鱼扔回河里（被认为是好运气）。",
	"Once a home to elves, Loudwater is a human town today. Its grand wood-and-stone buildings are overgrown by vines and hung with flowering plants. Streets curl and meander. Huge, old trees line the riverbanks, and gardens and bowers are everywhere. The town replaced its earthen rampart with a wall years ago, but the wall has flowers growing along its foundations both inside and outside the settlement. The river is unusually wide here, providing the town with space for a modest harbor.": "劳德沃特曾经是精灵的家园，今天是一个人类城镇。其宏伟的木石建筑被藤蔓所覆盖，挂满了花草。街道弯弯曲曲，蜿蜒曲折。河岸边有巨大的古树，花园和花圃随处可见。几年前，该镇用一堵墙取代了它的土城墙，但这堵墙在定居点内外的地基上都种着花。这里的河道异常宽阔，为该镇提供了一个适度的港口空间。",
	"Adding to Loudwater's problems are the stone giants of the Graypeak Mountains (see chapter 6, \"{@adventure Canyon of the Stone Giants|SKT|6}\"), who have begun laying waste to Llorkh, Orlbar, and the hamlets of Grayvale. Refugees are pouring into Loudwater, and those who can't afford to stay at the local inns are being herded like cows into warehouses overlooking the harbor. As if that weren't bad enough, stone giants have been seen spying on the town from afar, no doubt trying to determine its defensive capabilities. Since the Black Network keeps its forces well hidden in Loudwater and the town militia is a small force, Loudwater might seem like an easy target.": "让劳德沃特的问题雪上加霜的是灰峰山的石巨人（见第6章，\"{@adventure Canyon of the Stone Giants|SKT|6}\"），他们已经开始对Llorkh、Orlbar和Grayvale的村落进行破坏。难民们纷纷涌入劳德沃特，那些住不起当地旅馆的人就像牛一样被赶进了俯瞰港口的仓库。如果这还不够糟糕的话，有人看到石巨人从远处窥探该镇，无疑是想确定其防御能力。由于黑网在劳德沃特的势力隐藏得很好，而镇上的民兵又是一支小部队，劳德沃特似乎是一个容易的目标。",
	"The southern verge of the Lurkwood is safe enough to attract woodcutters, trappers, and hunters from Mirabar, Xantharl's Keep, and Longsaddle, but there's really no corner safe from the Uthgardt tribes that hunt here (primarily Black Raven and Thunderbeast barbarians). Goblinoids, wolves, and dire wolves also prowl these woods.": "卢克森林的南部边缘足够安全，吸引了来自米拉巴尔、桑塔尔堡和长鞍的伐木者、捕猎者和猎人，但实际上没有任何角落可以避开在此狩猎的乌斯加德特部落（主要是黑鸦和雷兽野蛮人）。哥布林人、狼和地狼也在这些森林里游荡。",

	"In reality, Luskan is anything but that. It's a dirty dive with filthy streets, squat buildings, ramshackle docks, creaky old longships, and crass pirates thinly disguised as sea traders. Rising above the fog and the stench is the Hosttower of the Arcane, home of a league of greedy, power-hungry wizards called the Arcane Brotherhood. Their ghastly tower branches into multiple thinner spires at the top. From a distance, the Hosttower might be mistaken for a giant, leafless tree. To those who have the misfortune of seeing it up close, it looks like a clawed hand bursting out of the ground, each of its fingers a tower with many peering windows.": "在现实中，卢斯坎并不是这样。它是一个肮脏的地方，有肮脏的街道、蹲踞的建筑、破旧的码头、吱吱作响的旧长船，以及伪装成海商的粗俗海盗。耸立在浓雾和恶臭之上的是奥术师的主塔，它是一个贪婪的、渴望权力的巫师联盟的家，被称为奥术师兄弟会。他们那座可怕的塔在顶端分成多个较细的尖塔。从远处看，Hosttower可能被误认为是一棵巨大的无叶树。对于那些不幸近距离看到它的人来说，它看起来就像一只张牙舞爪的手从地下迸发出来，它的每个手指都是一座带有许多窥视窗口的塔。",
	"Five High Captains rule the city. Each one is a glorified pirate lord who controls a fleet of longships. The five fleets serve many purposes: they defend Luskan against seafaring barbarians and other enemies, they conduct legitimate sea trade up and down the Sword Coast, and they raid and plunder the island kingdoms to the west (and the occasional settlement on the Sword Coast). The High Captains have no influence over the actions of the Arcane Brotherhood, nor is it apparent that the wizards have any allegiance to Luskan.": "五位高级船长统治着这座城市。每个人都是一个光荣的海盗领主，控制着一支长船舰队。这五支舰队有许多作用：他们保卫卢斯坎，抵御航海的野蛮人和其他敌人；他们在剑海岸上下进行合法的海上贸易；他们袭击和掠夺西部的岛屿王国（以及剑海岸上偶尔出现的定居点）。高级船长们对奥术师兄弟会的行动没有任何影响，也看不出巫师们对卢斯坎有任何效忠。",
	"Luskan's best-kept secret is that the High Captains are under the sway of Jarlaxle Baenre, the leader of a clandestine brotherhood of drow mercenaries and rogues called Bregan D'aerthe. Jarlaxle is a master schemer (and a master of disguise) who would like to bring Luskan into the Lords' Alliance, but the City of Sails has such an unsavory reputation and so little to offer that most alliance members won't allow it. That doesn't stop Jarlaxle from trying, especially now that the alliance has lost two members: Everlund and Sundabar.": "卢斯坎最不为人知的秘密是，高级船长们受贾拉索-贝恩雷（Jarlaxle Baenre）的控制，他是一个名为Bregan D'aerthe的鸦人雇佣兵和流氓的秘密兄弟会的领袖。贾拉索是个阴谋家（也是个伪装大师），他想把卢斯坎带入领主联盟，但风帆之城的名声太差，能提供的东西太少，大多数联盟成员都不允许它。这并不能阻止贾拉索的尝试，尤其是现在联盟已经失去了两个成员。埃弗伦德和桑达巴。",
	"Characters approaching Luskan for the first time see a thick black cloud of smoke rising from the harbor. The smoke billows out of a frost giant greatship (see the \"{@area Svardborg: General Features|350|x}\" sidebar in chapter 7, \"Berg of the Frost Giants\") that blew into port and rammed several longships, sinking them before a group of wizards emerged from the Hosttower of the Arcane and set the ship ablaze with a flurry of {@spell fireball} spells. The wizards have since returned to their monstrous tower, and the High Captains are waiting for the ship to stop burning before they board and search it. (Given the size of the ship, that could take a while.) Several charred frost giant corpses float facedown in the frigid water around the burning wreck, and the greatship's deck is strewn with other dead giants.": "第一次接近卢斯坎的角色看到了从港口升起的厚厚的黑色烟云。烟雾是从一艘冰霜巨人的大船（见第7章 \"冰霜巨人的伯格 \"中的\"{@area Svardborg: General Features|350|x} \"侧边栏）上飘出的，这艘船吹到了港口并撞上了几艘长船，在一群巫师从奥术师的主塔上出现并以一连串的{@spell fireball}法术将这艘船烧毁之前，它们被击沉。巫师们此后回到了他们的畸形塔中，而高级船长们正在等待这艘船停止燃烧，然后登船搜查。(鉴于这艘船的大小，这可能需要一段时间。）几具烧焦的冰霜巨人的尸体面朝下漂浮在燃烧的残骸周围的冰冷的水中，大船的甲板上散落着其他死去的巨人。",

Countless adventurers have perished in the Mere, drawn by true tales of ruined castles half-sunk in the mire. These once noble estates are now home to lizardfolk, undead, and worse. The greatest threats to would-be treasure hunters are the ancient black dragon twins Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor.

Despite its small size, Red Larch offers many fine amenities, including the Allfaiths Shrine, a place of worship that caters to multiple faiths; the Swinging Sword, a respectable three-story stone inn with a high-pitched roof; and the Helm at Highsun, a ramshackle yet lively tavern.": "红落叶松村因建村时被砍伐的一片独特的红落叶松树而得名，它位于桑伯山西郊的一片肥沃的土地上，位于克尔德尔路和凯恩路与长路的交界处。尽管面积不大，红落叶松却提供了许多良好的设施，包括全能神殿，一个迎合多种信仰的礼拜场所；摇摆之剑，一个有高坡屋顶的可敬的三层石头旅馆；以及高森之舵，一个破旧但热闹的小酒馆。",
	"Off the coast lies a collection of tiny islets known collectively as the Red Rocks. Most of these landforms are sea stacks carved by the waves of the Sea of Swords, but some are little more than boulders peeking up above the waves. The Red Rocks have sunk countless ships over the centuries, so sailors tend to give the area a wide berth. Fishers in small vessels frequent these waters, however, since the area is home to a huge variety of fish and shellfish, many of which are prized in Waterdeep.": "海岸外有一系列的小岛，统称为红岩。这些地貌大多是由剑海的波浪雕刻而成的海堆，但有些只不过是在波浪之上探出头来的巨石而已。几个世纪以来，红岩已经击沉了无数船只，所以水手们往往对该地区避而远之。然而，小船上的渔民们却经常光顾这片水域，因为这里盛产各种鱼类和贝类，其中许多都是沃特迪普的珍品。",

They recently found an artifact—half of a giant-sized vase—in the High Moor, and they're widening their search for other evidence of a cloud giant castle that crashed in this area thousands of years ago.

There, the followers of Uthgar buried both halves of a giant relic: a colorfully painted porcelain mask crafted long ago for a cloud giant. The mask is nonmagical, and each half weighs 20 pounds. If the halves are brought together, they display the image of a face that bears a fearsome scowl. The mask is too large to be repaired with a {@spell mending} spell.": "在Shining White的中央有一个祭坛冢，周围有一个狮鹫形状的土坑，它的形式并不明显，直到人们飞到空中或爬到岩石尖顶上。石头巨人把大理石祭坛砸成了瓦砾，但他们并没有在祭坛下面挖掘。在那里，乌斯加的追随者们埋下了一个巨大遗物的两半：一个很久以前为云端巨人制作的色彩斑斓的瓷器面具。面具是非魔法的，每一半都有20磅重。如果把两半放在一起，它们就会显示出一张带着可怕的皱纹的脸的形象。这个面具太大，无法用{@spell mending}的法术来修复。",

Fierce winds swirl through and around the mountains, forcing flying creatures away or causing them to veer suddenly and crash against the rocks.": "这些山峰笼罩在云层中，隐隐约约有一种威胁，它们从高森林的中心升起，高得足以从森林的任何边缘看到。在晴朗的夜晚，星山上会出现奇怪的、闪闪发光的灯光，有时会看到龙在山顶上飞来飞去。猛烈的风在山间和周围旋转，迫使飞行的生物离开，或使它们突然转向并撞上岩石。",
	"The Starmetal Hills are a range of rocky knolls between Neverwinter Wood and the Long Road. They are so named because the area has been the target of several meteor showers over the millennia. The hills are haunted by various tribes of Uthgardt, giving few others reason to visit the area.": "星陨山是永夜森林和长路之间的一系列岩石山丘。它们之所以被命名为 \"流星山\"，是因为千百年来，该地区一直是几个流星雨的目标。丘陵被乌斯加德特的各个部落所困扰，很少有人有理由去拜访这个地区。",

The tree's roots wrap around the ancient relic, which is actually a source of unrest for the Uthgardt ghosts that languish here (see \"Suggested Encounter\"). A {@spell detect magic} spell cast within range of the tree reveals an aura of necromancy magic emanating from underneath it. To reach the relic, characters must dig under the tree and hack away at its roots. This exercise takes a single character 40 hours to accomplish; multiple party members working together can reduce the amount of time accordingly. The buried relic is the skull of Gurt, Lord of the Pale Giants, a frost giant that Uthgar defeated in single combat at the site of Morgur's Mound. The skull weighs 100 pounds.

	"Most locals think only of the larger, higher hills west of the river when they hear \"Sumber Hills,\" because that area once boasted rich quarries and good hunting. Some hunting lodges and keeps owned by wealthy Waterdhavians and adventurers remain—and in recent years have become homes to bandits and monsters. Those who excavate the Sumber Hills for building stone and gravel often talk of finding gemstones and rich veins of ore in the hills—but for the most part, these persistent tales have never been anything but fiction.": "大多数当地人听到 \"桑伯山 \"时，只会想到河西更大、更高的山丘，因为该地区曾经拥有丰富的采石场和良好的狩猎环境。一些富裕的沃特达威人和冒险家拥有的猎场和庄园依然存在--近年来，这些地方成了强盗和怪物的家。那些在桑伯山区挖掘建筑石料和砾石的人经常谈论在山上发现宝石和丰富的矿脉，但在大多数情况下，这些持续的故事从来都是虚构的。",
	"Mirabar's sister-city is a shattered ruin. An orc horde destroyed this once-mighty fortress city during the War of the Silver Marches, wiped out its human population, drove the dwarven population deep underground, slew the city's dwarf king, and, perhaps worst of all, dealt a fatal blow to Sundabar's longstanding alliance with its human and elf neighbors.": "米拉巴尔的姐妹城市是一个破碎的废墟。兽人部落在银色牧场战争期间摧毁了这座曾经强大的要塞城市，消灭了它的人类人口，把矮人人口赶到地下深处，杀死了城市的矮人国王，而且，也许最糟糕的是，对桑达巴尔与其人类和精灵邻居的长期联盟造成了致命打击。",
	"The remaining dwarves of Sundabar have turned their backs on those who offered little or no aid in the city's time of need. They no longer consider themselves part of the Lords' Alliance.

Like most Uthgardt, he is fearful of magic and distrustful of spellcasters.": "{@creature Orok|SKT}的兄弟姐妹们无情地欺负他，所以他逃离了他的部落。虽然他显然是乌斯加特的孩子，但他身上没有任何东西能表明他是蓝熊部落的成员，他也不透露自己的部落归属，因为他害怕被送回部落。如果人物提供{@creature Orok|SKT}食物，他就会拿着食物跑回他的 \"巢穴 \"里去吞食。如果他看到任何魔法，他也会退回到壁炉中。像大多数乌斯加德人一样，他对魔法感到恐惧，对施法者不信任。",
	"{@creature Orok|SKT} is drawn to rough-looking wilderness types, such as barbarians and rangers. If such a character is friendly toward him, he bonds with that character and becomes that character's follower. {@creature Orok|SKT} doesn't willingly accompany the party otherwise, preferring to remain in his lair and live by catching fish in the nearby river.": "{@creature Orok|SKT}被野蛮人和游骑兵等粗犷的野外类型所吸引。如果这样的角色对他很友好，他就会与该角色结合，成为该角色的追随者。{@creature Orok|SKT}不愿意与队伍同行，他更愿意呆在自己的巢穴里，靠在附近的河里抓鱼为生。",
	"Perched atop a crag overlooking the Rauvin Road, with a clear view of the Evermoors to the south and the Moonwood to the north, is a keep of mortared stone with a high-pitched roof that has wooden statues of baying wolves rising from its peaks.

From the keep, the Zymorven family of Silverymoon has watched over the surrounding lands for four generations.": "在俯瞰劳文路的峭壁上，可以清楚地看到南边的常春藤和北边的月光森林，这是一座用石块砌成的堡垒，有一个高坡屋顶，其山峰上耸立着木制的狼群雕像。道路上的一条支线蜿蜒而上，通往堡垒的门楼和堡垒。银月镇的齐莫文家族从这个堡垒开始，四代人都在监视着周围的土地。",
	"Lord Zymorven's duty is to be vigilant and watch for trouble, which could come from any direction. Soldiers patrolling the Rauvin Road on horseback are welcome to use the keep as a place where they can rest as well as obtain food, drink, and lodging for their horses.

	"You spot a crumbling tower atop a hill less than a quarter mile away. Parts of its conical roof and outer shell have fallen inward, leaving a gaping hole above which four hawks circle.": "你发现在不到四分之一英里的山顶上有一座摇摇欲坠的塔。它的锥形屋顶和外壳的一部分已经向内倒塌，留下一个缺口，上面有四只鹰在盘旋。",
	"If the characters approach within a few hundred feet of the tower (see map 3.14), add:": "如果人物接近塔的几百英尺范围内（见地图3.14），则添加。",
	"A large boulder blocks the tower's ground-floor entrance, and a horrible noise comes from within—a deep, guttural, dirge pouring from the lips of something big and awful.": "一块大石头挡住了塔楼的底层入口，里面传来了可怕的声音--从一个大而可怕的东西的嘴里发出的低沉的、阴森的、哀怨的声音。",
	"Moog sits on the upper level of the tower (area 2), her calves and bare feet dangling through a hole in the floor. From this position, she can see anyone that enters the tower through the front door, the hole in the upstairs wall, or the window above the doorway. She has her back to the upstairs window that faces east, and can't see anyone approaching from that direction. Her incessant singing is so loud that she can't hear anything but the loudest noises outside the tower.": "穆格坐在塔楼的上层（2区），她的小腿和赤脚从地板上的一个洞里垂下来。从这个位置，她可以看到任何通过前门、楼上墙上的洞或门口上方的窗户进入塔内的人。她背对着楼上朝东的窗户，看不到从那个方向走来的人。她不停地唱歌，声音很大，除了塔外最响亮的声音，她什么都听不到。",
	"Moog has parked a large boulder in front of the doorway. A Small character can squeeze through a narrow opening to enter the tower. Otherwise, the boulder can be rolled aside with a successful DC 25 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. A stone staircase hugs the inside wall, spiraling upward in a clockwise direction and forming landings at various points. Situated next to each landing is a 9-foot-tall arrow slit that tapers to a width of 5 inches. Much of the tower floor and the staircase is strewn with rubble—stone from the crumbling walls and wood from the partially collapsed roof. The rubble counts as {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.": "穆格在门口停放了一块大石块。一个小个子的角色可以挤过一个狭窄的开口进入塔内。否则，只要成功地进行DC25力量({@skill Athletics})检查，就可以将巨石滚到一边。一条石阶环绕着内墙，以顺时针方向螺旋式上升，并在不同的位置形成落脚点。在每个着陆点旁边都有一个9英尺高的箭形缝隙，其宽度逐渐变小，只有5英寸。塔楼的大部分地板和楼梯都散落着碎石--来自摇摇欲坠的墙壁的石头和来自部分坍塌的屋顶的木材。这些碎石算作（1%）。",
	"Any character who searches through the rubble finds a cracked floor tile with what appears to be a compartment underneath it. Years ago, a halfling adventurer named Keltar Dardragon buried a treasure chest under the floor here, and he never had a chance to reclaim it before he died. Moog hasn't noticed the chest, which is locked but in poor condition. A character can easily break or pick the lock (no ability check required). The chest holds 300 sp and two magic items, determined by rolling on {@table Magic Item Table B} in {@book chapter 7|DMG|-1} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}.": "任何在废墟中搜索的角色都会发现一块破裂的地砖，地砖下面似乎有一个隔间。几年前，一个叫凯尔塔-达德拉贡的半身人冒险家在这里的地板下埋了一个宝箱，他在死前一直没有机会去取回它。穆格没有注意到这个箱子，它是锁着的，但条件很差。一个角色可以轻易地打破或撬开锁（不需要检查能力）。箱子里有300英镑和两件魔法物品，通过在{@book chapter 7|DMG|-1}的{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中滚动来确定。",
	"Nothing of value is to be found on this level of the tower except a large sack lying on the floor. Determine its contents by rolling three times on the Items in a Giant's Bag table in the introduction.": "在塔的这一层没有任何有价值的东西，只有一个躺在地上的大麻袋。通过在介绍中的 \"巨人袋中的物品 \"表上滚动三次来确定其内容。",
	"Moog is here unless she has been lured elsewhere. If the characters wait her out, Moog gets hungry and stops her mournful singing after {@dice 2d20} minutes. The hungry giant leaps down to the ground floor, pushes the boulder aside, and exits the tower in search of food. If the characters hide and let her go, she returns to the tower {@dice 3d10} hours later with a squealing boar tucked under one arm.": "穆格在这里，除非她被引诱到其他地方。如果角色们等她出来，Moog就会饿，并在{@dice 2d20}分钟后停止她的悲鸣。这个饥饿的巨人跳下地面，把巨石推到一边，然后离开塔楼去寻找食物。如果人物躲起来让她走，她会在{@dice 3d10}小时后回到塔里，一只胳膊下夹着一只尖叫的野猪。",
	"Moog has had some bad experiences with small folk in the past. Her inclination is to attack if confronted. Her tower contains enough rubble that she won't run out of rocks to throw anytime soon. Any character who tries to allay Moog's concerns by speaking to her calmly and soothingly in Giant can make a DC 12 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. If Moog is also bribed with food or treasure, this check is made with advantage.": "穆格过去有一些与小人物打交道的糟糕经历。她的倾向是在面对面的情况下进行攻击。她的塔里有足够的碎石，她不会很快就没有石头可扔了。任何试图通过用巨人语平静地和她说话来消除穆格的担忧的人物，都可以进行DC12魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查。如果穆格也被用食物或财宝贿赂，那么这个检查是有优势的。",
	"If the check succeeds, Moog stops attacking long enough to hear what the character has to say. She also reveals why she's so unhappy. If the characters promise to reunite Moog with her husband, she is delighted and tries her best to help them in return. Moog knows where {@creature Chief Guh|SKT} lives and can lead the party to Grudd Haug (see chapter 5, \"{@adventure Den of the Hill Giants|SKT|5}\"). She also knows that Grudd Haug is full of orcs, goblins, hobgoblins, and ogres. Moog is more frightened of {@creature Chief Guh|SKT} than she is of the characters and won't voluntarily help them attack Grudd Haug. She prefers to remain a safe distance away from the hill giant den (at least half a mile), but characters can convince Moog to accompany them by claiming that they need her help to identify Hruk and rescue him from the hill giant chief. Even when coaxed into joining the assault on Grudd Haug, Moog won't attack other hill giants. If she comes across her husband, she grabs him by the hair and leads him far away from Grudd Haug.": "如果检查成功，穆格就会停止攻击足够长的时间来听这个人物说什么。她还会透露她为什么如此不开心。如果人物承诺让Moog与她的丈夫团聚，她会很高兴，并尽力帮助他们作为回报。Moog知道{@creature Chief Guh|SKT}住在哪里，可以带领大家找到Grudd Haug（见第五章，\"{@adventure Den of the Hill Giants|SKT|5}\"）。她还知道格鲁德豪格到处都是兽人、地精、霍布格林和食人魔。Moog对{@creature Chief Guh|SKT}比她对这些人物更害怕，不会主动帮助他们攻击Grudd Haug。她更愿意与山丘巨人的巢穴保持安全距离（至少半英里），但角色可以通过声称他们需要她的帮助来识别赫鲁克并从山丘巨人首领那里救出他来说服摩格与他们同行。即使被哄骗加入对格鲁德-豪格的攻击，摩格也不会攻击其他山地巨人。如果她遇到了她的丈夫，她会抓住他的头发，带他远离Grudd Haug。",
	"Various special quests in chapter 2 can lead adventurers to Moongleam Tower in the city of Everlund. If the characters receive none of these quests, you can still use this encounter by having an agent of the Harpers approach the party and suggest that they visit Moongleam Tower, particularly if they're looking for a faster mode of travel.": "第二章中的各种特殊任务可以将冒险者引向Everlund市的Moongleam塔。如果人物没有接到这些任务，你仍然可以使用这个遭遇，让哈珀斯的代理人接近队伍，建议他们去莫昂莱姆塔，特别是如果他们正在寻找一种更快的旅行方式。",
	"Moongleam Tower is described in more detail in the \"Everlund\" section earlier in this chapter. Its resident archmage, Krowen Valharrow, is well aware of \"the giant problem.\" If the characters approach him, Krowen warns them that the giants' upheaval poses a grave threat to the balance of power in the North. He has it on good authority that the Harpers, the Lords' Alliance, the Emerald Enclave, the Order of the Gauntlet, and the Zhentarim are all taking steps to protect civilization against the giants' depredations. Krowen knows that giants and dragons have a long history of conflict, and he suspects that the dragons might somehow be responsible (directly or indirectly) for the giants' uprising.": "在本章前面的 \"Everlund \"部分，对Moongleam塔有更详细的描述。其常驻大法师克罗恩-瓦尔哈罗（Krowen Valharrow）对 \"巨人问题 \"非常了解。如果人物接近他，克洛温会警告他们，巨人的动荡对北方的权力平衡构成了严重威胁。他有充分的证据表明，哈珀人、领主联盟、翡翠飞地、高塔骑士团和赞塔林都在采取措施，保护文明免受巨人的掠夺。克劳恩知道巨人和龙的冲突由来已久，他怀疑龙可能要对巨人的起义负某种责任（直接或间接）。",

	"Fate brings the characters into contact with {@creature Harshnag|SKT} the Grim, a legendary good-aligned frost giant. In taverns throughout the North, he is known as a monster to some and a hero to others.

Believed to be hundreds of years old, {@creature Harshnag|SKT} wanders the wilderness with greataxe in hand, seeking to lay low his evil giant brethren.": "命运让人物接触到了{@creature Harshnag|SKT}狰狞，一个传说中的善良的冰霜巨人。在整个北方的酒馆里，他对一些人来说是怪物，对另一些人来说是英雄。在沃特迪普，他是灰色力量最大的成员，一个臭名昭著的破坏性冒险公司，不止一次来到城市的防御。他被认为已经有几百岁了，他手持大斧在荒野中游荡，试图压制住他邪恶的巨人兄弟们。",
	"{@creature Harshnag|SKT}'s history isn't important to this adventure, and he doesn't like to talk about his past. What's important is that he knows that the ordning has been broken, that the storm giants no longer have the power to keep the smaller giants in check, and that {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} has gone missing. He aims to protect the North from the depredations of evil giants while seeking out adventurers who share this goal. By the time the characters meet him, he has already slaughtered a few giants.": "{@creature Harshnag|SKT}的历史对这次冒险并不重要，他也不喜欢谈论他的过去。重要的是，他知道法令已经被打破，风暴巨人不再有能力控制小巨人，而且(1%)已经失踪了。他的目标是保护北方不受邪恶巨人的蹂躏，同时寻找与他有共同目标的冒险者。当人物遇到他时，他已经屠杀了几个巨人。",
	"{@creature Harshnag|SKT} looks like a typical frost giant except that he's clad in plate armor and wears the skull of a white dragon as a helm. His jagged axe also looks quite formidable. He's a giant of few words who prefers to let his actions do his talking. When he does speak outside of combat, he comes across as surprisingly calm and soft-spoken. While swinging his axe in battle, however, he bellows and laughs like a berserker. In the company of small adventurers, he tries not to dominate social situations or make too many decisions for them, because he knows how fragile and inflated their egos can be.": "{@creature Harshnag|SKT}看起来就像一个典型的冰霜巨人，除了他身穿板甲，戴着白龙的头骨作为头盔。他那把锯齿状的斧头看起来也很威武。他是一个少言寡语的巨人，更喜欢让他的行动来说话。当他在战斗之外说话时，他表现得出奇的平静和温和。然而，当他在战斗中挥动斧头时，他就像一个狂暴的战士一样，大吼大笑。在小型冒险家的陪伴下，他尽量不主导社交场合，也不为他们做太多的决定，因为他知道他们的自我意识是多么脆弱和膨胀。",
	"{@creature Harshnag|SKT} knows the North well and has no chance of becoming lost in its wilderness. He's sensitive to the fact that many small folk have a freshly rekindled fear of giants striding into their settlements. As a result, if the characters visit a settlement while {@creature Harshnag|SKT} is with them, he prefers to remain unseen on the outskirts.

Multiple characters working together to remove the ice shorten the time proportionately.": "通往这个房间的双扇门有30英尺高，并向房间内打开。通往4号和7号区域的双门上覆盖着一层4英寸厚的冰，在从这一侧拉开门之前，必须将其凿开或融化（无论是用物理方法还是借助敲击法术或开启的钟声）。一个{@spell fireball}的法术产生的热量足以融化一组门上的冰。否则，一个使用武器、镐或类似工具的人物需要1个小时才能削去覆盖在一套门上的冰，或者用火把融化冰。多个角色一起工作来清除冰块，会按比例缩短时间。",

After falling debris deals damage for 2 rounds, the ceiling collapses the next time initiative reaches 0, killing and burying anyone inside the temple.": "{@creature Harshnag|SKT}拒绝离开，并竭力阻止{@creature Iymrith|SKT}逃离，试图在以后的回合中抓住她。在坠落的碎片造成2个回合的伤害后，在下一次主动权达到0时，天花板就会坍塌，杀死并埋葬寺庙内的任何人。",
	"{@creature Iymrith|SKT} escapes the cave-in with the aid of her {@spell teleport} spell. {@creature Harshnag|SKT}'s fate is uncertain. Either he is killed in the collapse, or he manages to retreat to a safe location (such as area 11) at the last possible moment. In either case, the characters are unlikely to encounter him again unless he makes a surprise reappearance (see the \"Hekaton Returns!\" sidebar in chapter 12).": "{@creature Iymrith|SKT}借助她的{@spell teleport}法术逃离了山洞。{@creature Harshnag|SKT}的命运是不确定的。他要么在坍塌中丧生，要么在最后时刻设法撤退到一个安全的地方（比如11区）。无论哪种情况，角色们都不太可能再遇到他，除非他意外地再次出现（见第12章的 \"海卡顿回来了！\"侧边栏）。",

	"In this chapter, adventurers match wits with Guh, a monstrously fat hill giant chief whose den lies on a branch of the Dessarin River in the hills northeast of Goldenfields. If the characters defeat Guh and obtain her {@item conch of teleportation|SKT}, they can use it to teleport to Maelstrom, {@creature King Hekaton|SKT}'s undersea citadel (see chapter 10, \"Hold of the Storm Giants\"). Obtaining the conch is their main goal here. They must be careful not to put the den on alert before eliminating key threats, lest they become overwhelmed by all of Grudd Haug's denizens.": "在这一章中，冒险者将与古赫比试智慧，古赫是一个肥胖的山丘巨人首领，他的巢穴位于金地东北的山丘上的德萨林河的分支上。如果角色们打败了古赫，得到了她的{@item conch of teleportation|SKT}，他们就可以用它来传送到漩涡，{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}的海底城堡（见第10章，\"风暴巨人的控制\"）。获得海螺是他们在这里的主要目标。他们必须小心，在消除关键威胁之前不要让洞穴进入警戒状态，以免他们被格鲁德-豪格的所有居民所淹没。",
	"Before running this part of the adventure, review the information on hill giants in the Monster Manual. It will help you roleplay the giants in this chapter.": "在进行这部分冒险之前，请回顾一下《怪物手册》中关于山地巨人的信息。它将帮助你对本章中的巨人进行角色扮演。",
	"{@creature Chief Guh|SKT} would like hill giants elevated above their traditional betters. But she's no brighter than a typical hill giant, so her plan is anything but inspired. She plans to eat until she grows so enormous that the gods take notice and show her favor. To her, the biggest giant rules.": "{@creature Chief Guh|SKT}希望山地巨人的地位高于他们的传统对手。但她并不比一个典型的山地巨人聪明，所以她的计划并没有什么灵感。她计划一直吃到她长得如此巨大，以至于众神注意到并对她表示青睐。对她来说，最大的巨人才是统治者。",
	"Guh's gluttony knows no bounds. She has been feasting for several months and has grown to such a size that she can no longer walk on her own. She spends her time slumped in a wagon with broken axles, surrounded by heaps of stolen loot and crying out for more food.": "古氏的贪吃是没有止境的。她已经大吃大喝了好几个月，体型已经大到无法独立行走。她在一辆车轴断裂的马车里度过了她的时光，周围是成堆的偷来的战利品，她哭着喊着要更多的食物。",
	"{@creature Chief Guh|SKT} has driven away all the other female hill giants in her tribe and taken their husbands as her own. She tasks her many husbands with bringing her food, and she doesn't care how they go about it. Some of her mates form marauding gangs. Others set out on their own, pillaging the countryside for anything edible.": "{@creature Chief Guh|SKT}已经赶走了她部落里所有其他的女性山地巨人，并把他们的丈夫当作自己的丈夫。她要求她的许多丈夫为她带来食物，她并不在乎他们如何去做。她的一些配偶组成了掠夺团伙。其他人则独自行动，在乡间掠夺任何可食用的东西。",
	"Farmers who live downriver from Grudd Haug have suffered the most from the giants' depredations. The first inkling of trouble was a sudden drop in the river's water level, caused by the dam-like structure of the hill giant den. Not long thereafter, Guh's husbands and their followers began plundering livestock from riverside farms, stealing trees from orchards, knocking down cottages, and snatching up folk who didn't run fast enough.": "住在格鲁德-豪格下游的农民在巨人的掠夺中受害最深。第一个麻烦的苗头是河水水位的突然下降，这是由山丘巨人巢穴的水坝状结构造成的。此后不久，古赫的丈夫和他们的追随者开始从河边的农场掠夺牲畜，从果园偷取树木，推倒茅屋，并抢走跑得不够快的人。",
	"So far, most of the hill giants' activities have been confined to the region of the Dessarin Valley closest to their den, but as food becomes scarce, Guh's husbands are forced to expand their efforts outward. The villages of Beliard, Womford, and Uluvin, as well as caravans traveling the Iron Road between Womford and Uluvin, are all within the hill giants' threat radius. Meanwhile, the female hill giants exiled by Guh have taken to the hills. They crave the return of their husbands, but they are neither strong enough nor shrewd enough to unseat Guh. They might be convinced to help adventurers overthrow her if it means they get to beat their husbands into submission once more. See the \"Old Tower\" section in chapter 3 for an example of a female hill giant outcast.": "到目前为止，山丘巨人的大部分活动都局限在离他们的巢穴最近的德萨林谷地区，但随着食物的匮乏，古赫的丈夫们不得不将他们的努力向外扩展。贝利亚德（Beliard）、沃姆福德（Womford）和乌鲁文（Uluvin）的村庄，以及在沃姆福德和乌鲁文之间的铁道上行驶的商队，都在山地巨人的威胁半径之内。与此同时，被古赫流放的女性山地巨人已经上山了。她们渴望丈夫的回归，但她们既不够强大也不够精明，无法推翻古赫。她们可能会被说服，帮助冒险者推翻她，如果这意味着她们可以再次将自己的丈夫打得落花流水。参见第三章中的 \"旧塔 \"部分，了解一个女性山丘巨人被抛弃的例子。",
	"The hill giants' den is called Grudd Haug, which means \"river mound\" in Giant. Resembling a beaver dam, it straddles a river. The lower level of the den is lodged between two rocky outcroppings and made of piled timber packed with clay and mud, with hollow cavities that resemble caves. Above this piled timber foundation is a mud steading (a house made to giant scale) with a log roof. The structure is an impressive feat of engineering, well beyond the ability of hill giants to fabricate on their own. In fact, Grudd Haug's design is the work of hobgoblin and goblin engineers, assembled with the might of hill giant and ogre laborers. East of the steading is a yard enclosed by a 20-foot-high palisade wall made of logs lashed together with thick twine.": "山地巨人的巢穴被称为Grudd Haug，在巨人语中意为 \"河丘\"。它像一个海狸坝，横跨在一条河上。洞穴的下层位于两块岩石之间，由堆积的木材和粘土及泥浆组成，有类似洞穴的空洞。在这个堆积的木材基础之上是一个带有原木屋顶的泥棚（按巨大比例制作的房屋）。这个结构是一个令人印象深刻的工程壮举，远远超出了山地巨人自己制造的能力。事实上，格鲁德-豪格的设计是地精和妖精工程师的作品，与山地巨人和食人魔工人的力量结合在一起。大棚东面是一个院子，由20英尺高的栅栏墙围起来，栅栏墙是用粗麻绳把原木绑在一起。",
	"The characters can travel to Grudd Haug (shown on map 5.1) on foot or horseback. They can also guide a raft upstream or downriver to the hill giant den. In either case, you can make the journey more interesting by adding one or more wilderness encounters appropriate for hill terrain (see the Random Wilderness Encounters table in chapter 3). If Moog the hill giant is with the party, see the \"{@area Old Tower|27a|x}\" section in chapter 3 for tips on how to roleplay her once she arrives at Grudd Haug.": "人物可以步行或骑马前往格鲁德豪格（如地图5.1所示）。他们也可以引导木筏逆流而上或顺流而下到山丘巨人的巢穴。无论哪种情况，你都可以通过增加一个或多个适合山地地形的荒野遭遇来使旅程更加有趣（见第3章的随机荒野遭遇表）。如果山丘巨人莫格和队伍在一起，请参阅第三章的\"{@area Old Tower|27a|x} \"部分，了解她到达格拉德豪格后如何进行角色扮演的技巧。",
	"If the characters have an airship (see the \"Airship of a Cult\" section in chapter 4), they can land it pretty much anywhere outside Grudd Haug. The hobgoblins in the gong tower (see \"Approaching the Den\") spot the airship if it approaches within 1 mile of the stronghold and sound the alarm, putting the entire den on alert (see \"Denizens\"). If the characters use the airship's weaponry to attack Grudd Haug, the den's defenders are smart enough to take cover behind walls. Defenders armed with weapons that deal piercing damage target the balloon; those that hurl rocks and use weapons that deal bludgeoning damage target the crew.": "如果角色们有一艘飞艇（见第四章的 \"邪教的飞艇 \"部分），他们几乎可以在格鲁德-豪格以外的任何地方降落。如果飞艇接近据点1英里以内，锣鼓塔里的妖精（见 \"接近巢穴\"）就会发现它，并发出警报，使整个巢穴处于警戒状态（见 \"巢穴\"）。如果角色使用飞艇的武器装备来攻击格鲁德-豪格，巢穴的守卫者会很聪明地躲到墙后。装备有造成穿刺伤害的武器的防御者的目标是气球；那些投掷石块和使用造成击打伤害的武器的人的目标是船员。",
	"The characters might instead approach on a flying mount. They can obtain griffon mounts in Fireshear or hippogriff mounts in Hawk's Nest. Neither settlement is close to Grudd Haug, requiring the characters and their mounts to rest between flights. Characters mounted on hippogriffs can travel 54 miles per day (three 3-hour flights with 1-hour rests in between). Those mounted on griffons can travel 72 miles in the same amount of time. The hobgoblins in the gong tower (see \"Approaching the Den\") spot flying mounts that approach within a quarter mile of the stronghold and sound the alarm, putting the entire den on alert (see \"Denizens\").": "人物可能会骑着飞行坐骑接近。他们可以在Fireshear获得狮鹫坐骑，在Hawk's Nest获得河马坐骑。这两个定居点都不靠近格鲁德-豪格，需要人物和他们的坐骑在飞行之间休息。骑着河马的角色每天可以走54英里（三次3小时的飞行，中间休息1小时）。骑着狮鹫的人可以在同样的时间内行驶72英里。锣鼓塔中的妖精（见 \"接近巢穴\"）发现接近据点四分之一英里范围内的飞行坐骑，并发出警报，使整个巢穴处于警戒状态（见 \"居民\"）。",
	"The following features are common throughout the hill giant den, which reeks of filth.": "以下是整个山丘巨穴的共同特征，它散发着污秽的气味。",
	"Unless otherwise noted, interior chambers have 30-foot-high ceilings, with 20-foot-high passages and doorways connecting them.": "除非另有说明，室内的房间有30英尺高的天花板，有20英尺高的通道和门洞连接。",

Grudd Haug's defenders lack a cohesive defense strategy, but they are many.": "一旦发现入侵者或爆发战斗，整个巢穴都会进入警戒状态。因此，冒险者们可能会发现自己同时与好几场遭遇战的生物作战。格鲁德-豪格的守卫者缺乏统一的防御策略，但他们人数众多。",
	"If Guh dies, the morale of Grudd Haug's other denizens breaks, and they flee into the wilderness.": "如果古赫死了，格鲁德-豪格的其他居民的士气就会崩溃，他们就会逃到野外。",
	"All the hill giants in Grudd Haug, with the exception of Guh, are enslaved males. The ogres serve Guh because they are impressed by her size and her determination to rise to the top of the ordning (and, they hope, bring them along with her). The goblinoids have been promised shares of the spoils. The Iceshield orcs haunt the hills and grasslands north of Grudd Haug, near the western edge of the High Forest, and have forged a tenuous alliance with Guh. They are the least loyal of her supporters and don't get along with the goblinoids.": "除了古赫之外，格鲁德豪格的所有山地巨人都是被奴役的男性。食人魔为古赫服务，因为他们对古赫的体型和她登上军营顶峰的决心印象深刻（他们希望能把他们带在身边）。妖精们被许诺分享战利品。冰盾兽人出没于格鲁德豪格以北的山丘和草原，靠近高等森林的西部边缘，并与古赫建立了脆弱的联盟。他们是她的支持者中最不忠诚的，而且与哥布林诺人相处不融洽。",

The yakfolk used their magic to possess the bodies of their dwarven captives and, in the guise of these dwarves, yakfolk spies have infiltrated Citadel Adbar. These agents do everything in their power to discourage the dwarves from attacking Ironslag, mostly by assuring the citadel's leaders that the yakfolk pose no immediate threat. They also stand ready to assassinate Adbar's ruler, King Harnoth, if he tries to mount an attack on the village.": "在未经训练的人眼里，牦牛村看起来就像一个和平的、田园诗般的隐居地，坐落在山崖之上，用花岗岩墙壁挡住了呼啸的风。阿德巴城堡的矮人知道最好不要相信牦牛人，他们偶尔会派巡逻队去北方监视这个村庄。其中一支巡逻队遭到牦牛人的伏击，幸存者被俘。牦牛人用他们的魔法占有了他们的矮人俘虏的身体，并且，在这些矮人的伪装下，牦牛人的间谍已经潜入了阿德巴城堡。这些间谍尽其所能阻止矮人进攻铁矿，主要是向城堡的领导人保证牦牛人不会构成直接威胁。他们还准备在阿德巴的统治者哈诺特国王试图对村庄发动攻击时刺杀他。",

	"North of the Silver Marches is a range of towering, snow-covered mountains known as the Ice Spires. The great dungeon-forge of Ironslag is under the one known to dwarves of the Silver Marches as Mount Hamarhaast (\"hammer of ashes\"). Carved into the base of a 500-foot-high mountainside cliff is a pair of 50-foot-tall adamantine doors—airtight valves sealed by ancient magic. Adventurers hoping to gain access to the forge must figure out a way through these doors or find an alternate route. One such route is a staircase carved into the mountainside (see area 1). Another involves the use of flying mounts or an airship.": "在白银牧场的北部，有一片高耸入云、白雪覆盖的山脉，被称为 \"冰尖山\"。在银色山脉的矮人称为哈玛哈斯山（\"灰烬之锤\"）的那座山下，有一个伟大的铁匠堡。在500英尺高的山腰悬崖的底部，刻着一对50英尺高的金刚门--由古代魔法密封的密闭阀门。希望进入锻造厂的冒险者必须想办法通过这些门，或者找到另一条路线。其中一条路线是刻在山坡上的楼梯（见区域1）。另一条路线涉及到使用飞行坐骑或飞艇。",

If one or more of the characters are members of the Lords' Alliance, they can muster the resources to acquire a {@item spell scroll} of {@spell raise dead} free of charge, as long as they're in Yartar or another settlement that's part of the Lords' Alliance (see \"{@area The Lords' Alliance|00f|x}\" section in chapter 1).": "角色们可能会在Drylund勋爵被审问之前杀死他。如果Drylund勋爵在得知{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}的下落之前死亡，他们仍然可以通过对Drylund勋爵的尸体施展{@spell speak with dead}法术来了解风暴巨人王被关在哪里。如果他们没有这个选择，他们可以让Drylund勋爵起死回生。如果他们自己没有办法做到这一点，他们可以把Drylund勋爵的尸体带到任何一个主要城市的寺庙，然后花钱请人施展{@spell raise dead}法术。当事人必须提供法术的物质成分（一颗价值至少500金币的钻石），并向寺庙捐赠500金币。如果一个或多个角色是领主联盟的成员，他们可以集结资源免费获得{@item spell scroll}的{@spell raise dead}，只要他们在Yartar或其他属于领主联盟的定居点（见第一章的\"{@area The Lords' Alliance|00f|x} \"部分）。",

To calculate how long it takes for the characters to find the {@i Morkoth}, ascertain the rough distance from the party's starting location to the Purple Rocks, then calculate the amount of time it would take the party's conveyance to travel that distance. Once the characters get within 100 miles of the Purple Rocks, they have a base 10 percent chance per day of locating the {@i Morkoth}. This chance assumes that the characters are traveling in one group or aboard multiple conveyances in fairly close formation. If multiple conveyances are searching for the {@i Morkoth} and they are so widespread as to be at least 30 miles apart, roll separately for each conveyance.": "第三章介绍了你可以用来为海上航行增添色彩的随机遭遇。要计算人物找到{@i Morkoth}所需的时间，先确定从队伍的出发地到紫岩的大致距离，然后计算队伍的交通工具行驶这一距离所需的时间。一旦人物进入紫岩的100英里范围内，他们每天就有10%的机会找到{@i Morkoth}。这个概率是假设角色们是在一个团体中旅行，或者是在相当紧密的队列中乘坐多辆交通工具。如果多个运输工具都在寻找{@i Morkoth}，而且它们的分布范围很广，至少相隔30英里，那么就为每个运输工具分别掷硬币。",

Dragons don't tire as easily and can transport characters overseas if they are sufficiently motivated. Dragons are also able to avoid and outpace storms. A friendly metallic dragon of the party's acquaintance might be persuaded to make the journey for a sizable donation to its trove. One rare magic item or 10,000 gp per passenger wouldn't be unreasonable.": "由于无轨之海非常广阔，其岛屿也非常遥远，人物无法骑着狮鹫、河马或类似的生物到达{@i Morkoth}，因为坐骑在疲劳时没有地方可以着陆和休息。龙不会那么容易疲劳，如果有足够的动力，它可以把人物运送到海外。龙也能避开和超越风暴。一条党派认识的友好的金属龙可能会被说服，为它的宝库提供一笔可观的捐款，以完成这次旅行。每位乘客一件稀有的魔法物品或10,000金币并不是不合理的。",

The characters might also want to confront him after meeting the ghost of his dead son, Eigeron, in {@area chapter 4|2b9|x}, \"{@adventure The Chosen Path|SKT|4}.\" The shattering of the ordning has the following effects on Blagothkus:": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的部分内容发生在Skyreach城堡，这是一个属于一个名叫Blagothkus的云端巨人的飞行堡垒。你可以让他成为这次冒险的关键人物，让他的城堡在人物七八级的时候出现，让他们有机会见到这个邪恶的云端巨人，说服他帮助他们的事业。在{@area chapter 4|2b9|x}，\"{@adventure The Chosen Path|SKT|4} \"中见到他死去的儿子Eigeron的鬼魂后，人物可能也想与他对峙。法令的破碎对布拉戈斯库斯有以下影响。",
	"The cloud giant is eager to dispose of his Cult of the Dragon allies, use their money to buy the loyalty of lesser giants, and wage war against dragonkind. If the characters help him rid Skyreach Castle of the cultists and their white dragon ally, the giant pledges to help them in return and offers them one-third of the cult's spoils. Blagothkus honors his agreements as long as the characters pose no threat to him and he gets his way. If they have an airship with Cult of the Dragon members aboard (see the \"Airship of a Cult\" section in chapter 4), these cultists ally with the ones aboard Skyreach Castle.": "云端巨人急于处理他的龙之教盟友，用他们的钱来收买小巨人的忠诚，并对龙族发动战争。如果角色们帮助他清除天外堡的邪教分子和他们的白龙盟友，巨人保证会帮助他们作为回报，并提供他们三分之一的邪教战利品。只要人物不对他构成威胁，布拉戈斯库斯就会遵守他的协议，而他也会得偿所愿。如果他们有一艘载有神龙教成员的飞艇（见第四章的 \"神龙教飞艇 \"部分），这些邪教徒就会与天际城堡上的人结盟。",

	"{@i Princes of the Apocalypse} is a stand-alone adventure that takes place in and around the Sumber Hills in the Dessarin Valley, a lightly settled region of caravan towns, isolated homesteads, and wilderness. Four evil elemental cults have taken refuge there and are building secret temples in the ruins of a dungeon complex beneath the hills. By the time the characters reach 5th level, they will have visited several settlements in the valley, explored ruins in the Sumber Hills, and defeated a number of low- to middle-rank elemental cultists.": "{@i Princes of the Apocalypse}是一个独立的冒险，发生在德萨林山谷的桑伯山及其周围，这是一个由商队城镇、孤立的家园和荒野组成的轻度定居地区。四个邪恶的元素教派在那里避难，并在山下的地牢废墟中建造秘密寺庙。当人物达到5级时，他们将访问山谷中的几个定居点，探索桑伯山的废墟，并击败一些中低级的元素崇拜者。",
	"You can transition the characters from {@i Princes of the Apocalypse} to this adventure by having them defend the town of Triboar from a giant attack. In this scenario, Triboar becomes the starting point for this adventure (see chapter 2), and the characters are pulled away from the threat of Elemental Evil to focus on the giant threat instead. Here are a few hooks to lure the characters to Triboar, if they aren't there already.": "你可以让角色从{@i Princes of the Apocalypse}过渡到这个冒险，让他们保卫Triboar镇免遭巨人的攻击。在这种情况下，Triboar成为这次冒险的起点（见第二章），角色们被从元素邪恶的威胁中拉出来，转而关注巨人的威胁。这里有几个诱饵，可以把人物引到Triboar，如果他们还没有到那里的话。",
	"A priest of Helm, Silvarren Loomshank, is scheduled to relieve Imdarr Relvaunder, one of the priests at the Allfaiths Shrine in Red Larch. Silvarren is several days overdue, however, and Imdarr overheard a rumor that Silvarren is getting drunk nightly at the Talking Troll, a tavern in Triboar.

	"Herivin Dardragon, the halfling proprietor of the Harvest Inn in the town of Westbridge, has received reports that ogres and hill giants are pillaging farms along the Long Road between Westbridge and Triboar. Characters who head north to investigate can see that the reports are true. At one damaged farm, the characters encounter halflings who lost an orchard of olive trees and most of their livestock to hill giants. The Skittermarsh clan has gathered its remaining livestock (a sickly cow and four hungry goats) and packed its belongings on three mules with the intention of relocating to Triboar. The family matriarch, Misty Skittermarsh, offers the characters a 100 gp gem if they escort her family to Triboar.": "西桥镇丰收旅馆的半身人老板Herivin Dardragon收到报告说，食人魔和山地巨人正在西桥和特里波尔之间的长路上掠夺农场。前往北方调查的人物可以看到这些报告是真实的。在一个被破坏的农场里，人物遇到了半身人，他们被山地巨人夺走了一个橄榄树果园和大部分牲畜。斯基特马什（Skittermarsh）家族收集了剩余的牲畜（一头生病的奶牛和四只饥饿的山羊），并将其物品装在三头骡子上，打算搬迁到特里波尔。该家族的族长米斯蒂-斯基特马什（Misty Skittermarsh）为这些人物提供了一个100GP的宝石，如果他们护送她的家人到特里波尔。",
	"The Cult of the Howling Hatred, after witnessing several cloud giant castles drifting in the skies over the Sword Coast, sends representatives to meet with the cloud giants and learn their intentions. {@creature Countess Sansuri|SKT} is fascinated by the cult's ability to create devastation orbs and wants a demonstration.

	"{@i Out of the Abyss} takes place almost entirely in the Underdark, a subterranean expanse of caverns, tunnels, fissures, and lakes. The characters start the adventure as prisoners of the drow and, after escaping their captors, make their way to the surface.

	"Once the characters become embroiled in the affairs of giants, you might want to play down the demonic threat in the Underdark. Or you can move back and forth between the two adventures, giving players the option of accepting Bruenor's quest to descend into the Underdark before returning to the surface to deal with the giants. In the latter case, it's likely that the characters will be higher level than normal, but you can make the encounters in this adventure more challenging to compensate (see the \"{@book Modifying Encounter Difficulty|DMG|3|Modifying Encounter Difficulty}\" section in chapter 3 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}).": "一旦人物卷入巨人的事务，你可能想淡化地下城的恶魔威胁。或者你可以在两个冒险之间来回走动，让玩家选择接受布鲁诺的任务，先下到暗黑世界，然后再返回地面对付巨人。在后一种情况下，角色的等级很可能比正常情况下要高，但你可以让这次冒险中的遭遇更具挑战性以作为补偿（见{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}第三章的\"{@book Modifying Encounter Difficulty|DMG|3|Modifying Encounter Difficulty} \"部分）。",

	"{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} sits on the {@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}, flanked by her two advisors, {@creature Imperator Uthor|SKT} and {@creature Iymrith|SKT} (see {@adventure appendix C|SKT|16}). {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} wears the {@item Korolnor Scepter|SKT} (see \"Treasure\") as a pendant, tied to a kelp necklace.": "{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}坐在{@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}上，身旁是她的两个顾问，{@creature Imperator Uthor|SKT}和{@creature Iymrith|SKT}（见{@adventure appendix C|SKT|16}）。{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}将{@item Korolnor Scepter|SKT}（见 \"宝藏\"）作为吊坠佩戴在海带项链上。",

	"In a short time, {@creature Iymrith|SKT} has established herself as a surrogate mother figure to all three of Hekaton's daughters. {@creature Iymrith|SKT} tries to squash any alliance between the storm giants and the small folk by telling {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} that the adventurers can't be trusted, adding hastily, \"For all we know, they're the ones who murdered your mother and abducted your father!\" {@creature Iymrith|SKT} realizes almost instantly that she has chosen those words poorly, for how could she know that Hekaton has been abducted? If the players fail to pick up on her self-incriminating words, have {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} and all characters present make a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check. Those who succeed on the check realize that {@creature Iymrith|SKT} knows more than she's letting on.": "在很短的时间内，{@creature Iymrith|SKT}已经确立了自己作为赫卡顿所有三个女儿的代理母亲的地位。{@creature Iymrith|SKT}试图粉碎风暴巨人和小市民之间的任何联盟，她告诉{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}，冒险者是不可信任的，并匆忙补充说：\"据我们所知，他们就是杀害你母亲和绑架你父亲的人！\" {@creature Iymrith|SKT}几乎立刻意识到她选择的这些话很糟糕，因为她怎么可能知道赫卡顿被绑架了？如果玩家们没能听出她的自证其罪的话，就让{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}和所有在场的人物做一个DC15的智慧（{@skill Insight}）检查。检查成功的人意识到{@creature Iymrith|SKT}知道的比她说的多。",
	"If the characters accuse {@creature Iymrith|SKT} of being a dragon in disguise, she expresses outrage at the accusation and tries to convince {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} that this claim is a ploy to sow discord in the storm giants' court. Heedless of {@creature Iymrith|SKT}'s words, {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} is inclined to give the characters the benefit of the doubt. When it becomes clear to {@creature Iymrith|SKT} that {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}'s fondness for small folk can't be undone with mere words, the dragon begins plotting her exit strategy.": "如果人物指责{@creature Iymrith|SKT}是伪装的龙，她会对这种指责表示愤怒，并试图说服{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}，这种说法是在风暴巨人的法庭上挑拨离间的伎俩。不理会{@creature Iymrith|SKT}的话语，{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}倾向于给这些人物以怀疑的好处。当{@creature Iymrith|SKT}清楚地意识到{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}对小人物的喜爱是无法用言语来挽回的，龙开始策划她的退出策略。",
	"{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} wears the {@item Korolnor Scepter|SKT}, which allows her to sit on the {@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT} and harness its magical powers.

	"If the characters forge an alliance with {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} or expose {@creature Iymrith|SKT} as a villainous deceiver, the blue dragon returns to her lair in the Anauroch desert and isn't encountered again until chapter 12, \"{@adventure Doom of the Desert|SKT|13}.\"": "如果人物与{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}结成联盟或揭露{@creature Iymrith|SKT}是个反派骗子，那么蓝龙就会回到她在阿瑙罗奇沙漠的巢穴，直到第12章\"{@adventure Doom of the Desert|SKT|13} \"才会再次遇到。",
	"{@creature King Hekaton|SKT} often used the {@spell sending} property of the cave to arrange meetings with lesser giants and used the {@spell teleport} property from time to time to send guests to far-flung destinations.

	"Operatives of the Kraken Society have {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} in their clutches. If the characters forge an alliance with {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT} and agree to find her father, she gives them a wooden coin painted with the image of a golden goose that was found near the corpse of her slain mother, Queen Neri. {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} presumes (correctly) that the coin was accidentally dropped by one of her mother's assassins.": "克拉肯协会的特工将{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}关在他们的魔掌中。如果人物与{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT}结盟并同意找到她的父亲，她会给他们一枚绘有金鹅图案的木币，这枚木币是在她被杀的母亲奈里女王的尸体旁发现的。{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}推测（正确），这枚硬币是她母亲的一个刺客不小心掉落的。",
	"The wooden coin given to the characters by {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT} is fairly unremarkable and easy to produce. It's half again the size of a typical gold coin, and there's nothing magical about it. A {@spell legend lore} spell provides no clues as to its origin, since the coin isn't legendary.": "{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT}给人物的木币相当不显眼，也很容易制作。它只有一般金币的一半大小，而且没有什么神奇之处。一个{@spell legend lore}的法术没有提供任何关于它的来源的线索，因为这枚硬币并不具有传奇性。",
	"Hekaton has no idea that his court has been thrown into upheaval and that evil forces are conspiring to usurp his throne. Only when the battle aboard the {@i Morkoth} has ended can the characters bring Hekaton up to date on recent developments. Regardless of what he is told, the king remains skeptical until he has had a chance to speak with his daughter, {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}, and his brother, Uthor. He urges the characters to return to Maelstrom with him. Characters can either use Hekaton's conch to teleport themselves and the storm giant king to Maelstrom, or they can follow Hekaton as he dives into the water and swims home.": "赫卡顿不知道他的宫廷已经陷入动荡，邪恶势力正在密谋篡夺他的王位。只有当{@i Morkoth}号上的战斗结束后，人物才能向赫卡顿介绍最新的发展情况。不管他被告知了什么，国王仍然持怀疑态度，直到他有机会与他的女儿{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}和他的兄弟乌瑟尔交谈。他敦促角色们和他一起返回漩涡镇。角色可以使用海卡顿的海螺将自己和风暴巨人国王传送到漩涡，也可以跟随海卡顿潜入水中，游回家。",
	"Once it sinks the {@i Morkoth}, the kraken withdraws into the dark depths. If Hekaton is present, the kraken tries to drag the storm giant king down with it, leaving the puny and insignificant surface-dwelling adventurers to fend for themselves. Hekaton doesn't survive long in the kraken's clutches. If the storm giant king dies, all is not lost. Characters can return to Maelstrom and report the sorry news to {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}. Although Hekaton's death is hard on her, {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} is determined to see the ordning restored in his name and takes her father's place in the next chapter of the adventure.": "一旦它沉入{@i Morkoth}，海怪就会撤回到黑暗的深处。如果海卡顿在场，海怪就会试图把风暴巨人王也拖下水，让那些微不足道的表面居住的冒险者自生自灭。海卡顿在克拉肯的魔掌下活不了多久。如果风暴巨人国王死了，一切都不会消失。角色可以回到漩涡镇，向{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}报告这个不幸的消息。虽然海卡顿的死让她很难过，但{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}决心看到以他的名义恢复法令，并在冒险的下一章中取代她父亲的位置。",

	"An ancient blue dragon is more than a match for a party of 10th-level adventurers, but the characters have storm giants watching their backs. Hekaton or {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} also gives each character a {@item potion of giant size|SKT} (see {@adventure appendix B|SKT|15}) from the royal treasury, enabling them to face the dragon as true giants when the time comes. The storm giants describe the effect and duration of the potions, but they leave it to the characters to decide if and when to use them. The characters can quaff their potions before they enter {@creature Iymrith|SKT}'s lair or wait until they are about to engage the dragon in battle. Conversely, one or more characters might prefer to use the potions only as a last resort.": "一条古老的蓝龙对10级的冒险者队伍来说是个不小的挑战，但这些角色有风暴巨人在背后看着。海卡顿或{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}还从皇家宝库中给了每个角色一个{@item potion of giant size|SKT}（见{@adventure appendix B|SKT|15}），使他们能够在时机成熟时作为真正的巨人面对巨龙。风暴巨人描述了药水的效果和持续时间，但他们让角色决定是否和何时使用它们。角色们可以在进入{@creature Iymrith|SKT}的巢穴之前喝下他们的药水，或者等到他们即将与龙交战的时候再喝。相反，一个或多个角色可能更愿意在最后关头才使用药水。",
	"Hekaton or {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} also gives the party a {@item claw of the wyrm rune|SKT} (see {@adventure appendix B|SKT|15}) recovered from a shipwreck near Maelstrom.

	"The storm giants bear the burden of finding the dragon so that the characters can focus on preparing themselves for the final showdown. Hekaton and {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} know that blue dragons favor desert surroundings, and it doesn't take much research for them to discover that {@creature Iymrith|SKT} has a reputation in the North. The storm giants learn the following facts about their nemesis:": "风暴巨人承担了寻找龙的重任，这样人物就可以专注于为最后的决战做准备。赫卡顿和{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}知道蓝龙喜欢沙漠环境，他们不费吹灰之力就发现{@creature Iymrith|SKT}在北方很有名气。风暴巨人们了解到关于他们的克星的以下事实。",

For their part, the cultists are willing to crew the vessel so that the characters can focus on navigation, as well as loading, aiming, and firing the onboard weapons.": "这艘船的船员由八名龙之邪教（中立邪恶的男性和女性人类{@creature Cultist||cultists}，来自不同的种族）组成，他们都穿着黑色皮甲和黑色皮面具。这些教徒是一群不幽默但坚定的人。他们的名字是Delsephine, Nyzroth, Brassik, Laz, Oriskus, Perella, Tralt和Zalthia。Delsephine是他们的领袖。任何时候都有四人值班（两人负责驾驶飞船，两人值班监视），而其他人休息。如果一名队员观察到一名或多名教徒在整整一天内操作飞船，通过成功的DC 15智力检定，就能学到足够关于飞船操作的知识，以取代船员的位置。就他们而言，这些教徒愿意驾驶飞船，以便角色可以专注于导航，以及装载、瞄准和开火飞船上的武器。",
	"The cultists know the way to Klauthen Vale, but they won't lead the characters there willingly until after {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} is set free. Although the cultists don't know it, {@creature Klauth|SKT}'s promise of a reward is disingenuous. If the characters accept his offer and visit him at the appointed time, he attacks them as they enter Klauthen Vale, seeing no further use for them. Old Snarl has no intention of giving the them even one coin from his vast hoard.": "邪教徒知道通往克劳森谷(Klauthen Vale)的路，但在{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}被释放之前，他们不会愿意带领角色们去那里。尽管邪教徒不知道，{@creature Klauth|SKT}的奖励承诺是虚伪的。如果角色们接受他的提议并在约定时间去拜访他，他会在他们进入克劳森谷时袭击他们，认为他们已经没有任何用处。老咆哮者(Old Snarl)根本没有打算从他庞大的财宝中给他们一文钱。",
	"The airship's enormous balloon is made from dragon hide that has been dyed bright red. Atop the balloon is a crow's nest that is reached by crawling up the ropes on the outside of the balloon. Crawling up the ropes requires a DC 10 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. If the check fails, no progress is made; if the check fails by 5 or more, the creature falls.": "飞船巨大的气球是用染成鲜红色的龙皮制成的。气球顶部有一个乌鸦巢，通过沿着气球外部的绳子爬上去可以到达。沿着绳子爬行需要进行一次 DC 10 力量（{@skill Athletics}）或敏捷（{@skill Acrobatics}）检定。如果检定失败，就不会有任何进展；如果检定失败超过5点，生物会摔落。",
	"In the middle of the upper deck is a 10-foot-tall, cylindrical bronze furnace with a {@creature fire elemental} magically trapped inside it. A narrow hatch in the front of the furnace has a small grill through which the elemental can be seen, and the heat pouring out through the grill helps keep the deck crew warm on cold days and nights. An iron wheel on the starboard side of the furnace opens and closes a bronze valve at the top of the cylinder, which has the effect of increasing or reducing the size of the fire spilling out of the furnace. The more heat that is allowed to fill the balloon, the higher the ship can rise.": "在上层甲板中央是一个10英尺高的圆柱形青铜熔炉，里面被困住了一个{@creature fire elemental}。熔炉前面有一个狭窄的舱口，通过舱口的小格栅可以看到元素，格栅中透出的热量有助于在寒冷的日夜里让甲板工作人员保暖。熔炉的右舷侧有一个铁轮，可以打开或关闭圆柱顶部的青铜阀门，这样可以增加或减少从熔炉中喷出的火焰的大小。允许更多热量填满气球，飞船就能升得更高。",
	"Opening the hatch or the valve doesn't release the fire elemental, but destroying the furnace does, as does successfully casting {@spell dispel magic} (DC 19) on it. The furnace has AC 15, 30 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage. The fire elemental goes berserk if released, attacking all other creatures it sees. Inside or outside the furnace, it can be banished using a {@spell banishment} spell or similar magic, or trapped inside an {@item iron flask} or a similar device. If the furnace is destroyed or the elemental released from within it, the air inside the balloon cools, causing the airship to descend at a rate of 10 feet per round.": "打开舱口或阀门不会释放火元素，但摧毁熔炉会释放它，成功施放 {@spell dispel magic} (DC 19) 也会。熔炉的AC为15，有30点生命值，伤害阈值为10，对火焰、毒素和精神伤害免疫。释放后，火元素会暴走，攻击所有看到的其他生物。在熔炉内外，可以使用 {@spell banishment} 法术或类似魔法将其驱逐，或者困在 {@item iron flask} 或类似装置中。如果熔炉被摧毁或从中释放元素，气球内的空气会冷却，导致飞艇每轮下降10英尺。",
	"At the foot of the stairs is a steel hatch bolted shut from the outside, with two horizontal-sliding iron levers in the adjacent wall. One lever is labeled Thrust, the other Direction (in Common). Behind the hatch is a steel-walled compartment that holds a magically bound {@creature air elemental}. The air elemental powers the aft propeller. Moving the Thrust lever to the left opens valves that allow wind from the elemental to spin the propeller. Moving the lever to the right closes the valves, and the propeller stops turning. Moving the Direction lever to the left or right causes the propeller to pivot in that direction, allowing the ship to turn while the propeller is operating. When the Direction lever is centered, the propeller moves the vessel straight ahead. Opening the hatch frees the elemental, whereupon it attacks any creature it sees. Without the air elemental to propel it, the ship can't push itself across ice or snow and, if aloft, it moves in accordance with the prevailing wind.": "在楼梯脚下有一个钢制舱门，从外面用螺栓紧紧地锁住，旁边墙壁上有两个水平滑动的铁制手柄。一个手柄标着推力，另一个是方向（在普通语中）。舱门后面是一个钢墙隔间，里面装着一个被魔法束缚的{@creature air elemental}。这个风元素为船尾推进器提供动力。将推力手柄向左移动会打开阀门，允许元素中的风转动推进器。将手柄向右移动会关闭阀门，推进器停止转动。将方向手柄向左或向右移动会使推进器朝那个方向转动，允许船只在推进器运转时转向。当方向手柄处于中间位置时，推进器会使船只直线前进。打开舱门会释放元素，随后它会攻击看到的任何生物。没有风元素推动，船只无法在冰雪上推进，如果在空中，它会随着主导风向移动。",
	"Each of these cabins has a door that can be bolted shut from the inside, though none of the doors is locked normally. A door can be broken open with a successful DC 13 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. Each cabin contains two hammocks (one above the other), a writing desk, a chair, a footlocker, and a porthole. The portholes' windows are latched shut from the inside, each set in a frame wide enough for a Medium creature to squeeze through.": "这些小屋每一间都有一扇门，可以从里面用门栓锁上，尽管通常情况下这些门都没有锁。要打开一扇门，需要进行一次成功的 DC 13 力量检定（{@skill Athletics}）。每间小屋里有两张吊床（一张在上面，一张在下面），一张写字桌，一把椅子，一个行李箱和一个舷窗。舷窗的窗户可以从里面用闩锁上，每个窗户都嵌在一个足够宽的框架中，足够中等生物通过。",
	"These intelligent avians fly close to the airship to get a better look. They have had several deadly run-ins with the Cult of the Dragon and recognize the cultists from their attire. If they spot one or more uniformed cultists on the deck of the airship or in the crow's nest, they attack. Otherwise, the aarakocra fight only in self-defense. If at least five aarakocra are present, they try to perform an aerial dance to summon an {@creature air elemental} for assistance. Characters can negotiate a truce with the aarakocra by succeeding on a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, but only if they refrain from attacking and communicate in a language that the aarakocra understand.": "这些聪明的鸟人飞得离飞船很近，以便更好地观察。他们曾与龙之教会发生过几次致命冲突，并能从他们的服饰中认出教会成员。如果他们在飞船甲板上或乌鸦巢中发现一个或多个穿着制服的教会成员，他们会发动攻击。否则，飞鹰人只会进行自卫。如果至少有五只飞鹰人在场，他们会尝试进行一场空中舞蹈来召唤 {@creature air elemental} 的帮助。角色可以通过成功进行一次 DC 15 魅力检定 ({@skill Persuasion}) 与飞鹰人达成停战协议，但前提是他们不发动攻击并用飞鹰人能理解的语言交流。",
	"Characters on the upper deck or in the crow's nest spot {@dice 1d4 + 2} {@creature Berserker||berserkers} (CE male and female Uthgardt humans) who belong to either the Black Raven tribe or the Griffon tribe. Each berserker rides a trained {@creature giant raven|SKT} (use the {@creature giant vulture}) or a {@creature griffon}, as appropriate.": "在上层甲板或乌鸦巢{@dice 1d4 + 2}中发现{@creature Berserker||berserkers}(CE 男性和女性乌萨格人)属于黑乌鸦部落或狮鹫部落。每个狂战士骑着一匹训练有素的{@creature giant raven|SKT}(使用{@creature giant vulture})或者{@creature griffon}，视情况而定。",
	"This encounter takes place after the adventurers return to area 6 from area 11, having delivered one or more giant relics and chosen a giant lord to defeat. {@creature Iymrith|SKT} appears as they prepare to exit the temple for the last time.": "冒险者们从区域11返回到区域6后，交付了一个或多个巨人遗物，并选择了要击败的巨人领主，这一场景发生在他们最后一次准备离开神庙时。{@creature Iymrith|SKT}出现在他们准备最后一次离开神庙时。"
