	"Ixalan is a land of exploration and discovery. But the Legion of Dusk—a vampire society that formed from an alliance of nobles and the church—has recently arrived from overseas to expand its territories.

However, their plans have been met with resistance from the inhabitants of Ixalan.": "伊萨兰是一片探索和发现的土地。但黄昏军团--一个由贵族和教会联盟形成的吸血鬼社团--最近从海外来到这里，扩大其领土。军团的军队试图征服该岛，而吸血鬼在南部建立了许多堡垒。然而，他们的计划遭到了艾克萨兰居民的抵抗。",
	"The Sun Empire rules the coast, and has managed to tame dinosaurs enough to work alongside them.

	"At sea, forces of the piratical Brazen Coalition harry the naval forces of the Legion of Dusk, which make landfall to plunder the bounty of Ixalan as they see fit.

	"The Legion of Dusk is ruled by rituals that require its members to feed only from the blood of their foes.

Vona has uncovered a map of the local region that shows the location of a powerful artifact known as the Hierophant's Chalice, hidden in the south of Ixalan at the Temple of Aclazotz.
