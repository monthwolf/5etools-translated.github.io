Then the cataclysm happened. You don't recall what it was, but it scattered the unified tribes to the four winds, and as you fought to survive, all that you once knew, all that you once had, was lost.

	"This room once held services in respect of powerful orc warriors and leaders, whose bodies were sealed behind the walls upon their death. Unlike standard orcish funerary services, which often involve complete immolation or a traditional burial, these highly respected members of society were interred here so that their spirits would remain in the world for guidance and leadership. Now, however, two of the spirits have become {@creature wraith||wraiths} and the third is a {@creature banshee}; maddened by many years of silence, they have developed a hunger for life that far surpasses any desire for glory that they held in life—but should they be appeased, they may provide boons to those that come here.": "这个房间曾经为强大的兽人战士和领袖举行过仪式，他们的尸体在死后被封在墙后。与标准的兽人殡葬仪式不同的是，这些备受尊敬的社会成员被安葬在这里，以便他们的灵魂留在这个世界上，接受指导和领导。然而现在，其中两个灵魂已经变成了{@creature wraith||wraiths}，第三个是{@creature banshee}；由于多年的沉默，他们对生命的渴望已经远远超过了他们生前对荣耀的渴望--但如果他们被安抚，他们可能会给来到这里的人带来好处。",

	"Yesterday, three elven adventurers used this room as their lair. Unfortunately for them, a young pair of hungry owlbears also wanted to be here. When the characters first enter the room, the owlbears are fast asleep, having gorged on the hapless elves; should they awaken, they are neutral to friendly in their initial reactions due to their recent feeding. If the characters are cautious and respectful of the owlbears, they may follow them for a time in the hopes of finding another easy meal or two.": "昨天，三个精灵冒险家把这个房间作为他们的巢穴。不幸的是，一对年轻饥饿的猫头鹰熊也想来这里。当人物第一次进入这个房间时，猫头鹰熊正在大口大口地吃着这些可怜的精灵；如果它们醒来，由于刚刚进食，它们的最初反应是中性到友好的。如果角色们对猫头鹰熊持谨慎和尊重的态度，他们可能会跟随它们一段时间，希望能再找到一两份简单的食物。",

	"It is believed that if you \"prepare a spell but do not cast, lose a memory from your past.\" Most Eroding Ones are resigned to the possibility of their memories eroding in time.

	"On a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill History}) or ({@skill Religion}) check, characters interpret the hall's carvings. On a failure, Audra describes what she's learned. Ages ago, the cave entrance was found by a small group of displaced orcs. In time, there were wars and treaties with other orc groups, and the community grew. Infighting within the united community saw leaders rise and fall. One leader among many makes repeated appearances at the front line of conflicts, portrayed as the hero of some clashes and as the instigator of others. It appears his obsession with fighting elves led to frivolous losses. The likeness and circumstances make Curgain Bloodsplatter (\"Lake of the Ancestors,\" area 41) the most likely name of this overlox. The last scene shows orc healers (Hinsha from \"The Healing Quarters\"), the military, and worgs, preparing for some battle or calamity. It seems none of the ancestors returned to immortalize the outcome in stone. (More descriptions in areas 8a and 8b.)": "在成功通过DC15智力({@skill History})或({@skill Religion})检查后，人物可以解释大厅的雕刻。如果失败，奥德拉将描述她所了解的情况。很久以前，这个洞口是由一小群流离失所的兽人发现的。随着时间的推移，他们与其他兽人团体发生了战争并签订了条约，社区也随之壮大。在这个团结的社区中，领导人的内讧此起彼伏。在众多领导人中，有一位领导人多次出现在冲突的前线，被描绘成一些冲突的英雄和其他冲突的煽动者。看来他对与精灵作战的痴迷导致了轻率的损失。这种相似性和情况使得库尔干-斯普拉特（Curgain Bloodsplatter）（\"祖先之湖\"，第41区）最有可能成为这个过街老鼠的名字。最后一个场景显示了兽人治疗师（\"疗养院 \"中的Hinsha）、军队和虫族，正在为一些战斗或灾难做准备。似乎没有一个祖先回来把结果写在石头上不朽。(在8a和8b区域有更多描述）。",
