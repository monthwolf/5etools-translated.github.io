	"This book is written for the Dungeon Master. It contains a complete Dungeons & Dragons adventure, as well as descriptions for every creature and magic item in the adventure. In the course of reading this overview and playing this adventure, you'll learn the basics of how to run a D&D game.": "本书是为地下城管理员编写的。它包含了一个完整的龙与地下城冒险，以及冒险中每个生物和魔法物品的描述。在阅读这个概述和玩这个冒险的过程中，你会学到如何运行一个D&D游戏的基本知识。",
	"This is not a typical D&D adventure, though. As it's set in the world of {@i Rick and Morty}, much of the adventure beyond this introduction and the book's appendices are written by Rick Sanchez. While Rick's encounters are wildly unpredictable (and sometimes include his outlandish viewpoints), this adventure generally works as any other D&D adventure world. There's just more in-character narration from the author and a lot more butt jokes. The experience here is meant to feel slapstick and wild, so try not to take things too seriously. Additionally, if you feel the need to paraphrase any of Rick's descriptions (or cut back on his personal editorializing) feel free—you have a better sense of what your players will enjoy than Rick does!": "不过，这并不是一个典型的D&D冒险。由于它设定在{@i Rick and Morty}的世界里，除了这段介绍和书中的附录之外，大部分的冒险都是由瑞克-桑切斯写的。虽然瑞克的遭遇是疯狂的不可预测的（有时还包括他离奇的观点），但这个冒险一般来说和其他的D&D冒险世界一样有效。只是有更多来自作者的角色叙述和更多的笑料。这里的体验是为了让人感到滑稽和狂野，所以尽量不要把事情看得太严重。此外，如果你觉得有必要转述瑞克的任何描述（或减少他的个人编辑），请随意，你比瑞克更清楚你的玩家会喜欢什么。",
	"The rulebook in this boxed set contains everything you need to adjudicate the situations that arise during play. As this adventure is more frantic than most, don't worry about messing up. This adventure is all about seat-of-your-pants action, so if there's a rules slip-up, just roll with it. And, if at any point you're uncertain of how to proceed, refer to the \"Dungeon Master Tips\" section.": "这套盒装的规则书包含了你在游戏中出现的情况所需的一切裁决。由于这次冒险比大多数的冒险都要疯狂，所以不用担心会出乱子。这个冒险是所有关于你的裤子的行动，所以如果有一个规则的失误，只是滚动与它。而且，如果在任何时候你不确定该如何进行，请参考 \"地下城主提示 \"部分。",
	"{@i The Lost Dungeon of Rickedness: Big Rick Energy} is an adventure for four to five characters of 1st level. During the course of the adventure, the characters will advance to 3rd level.

	"While the rulebook provides you with everything you need to create your own characters, this adventure assumes players are using the {@i Rick and Morty} {@adventure pregenerated characters|rmbre|0|Pregenerated Characters} provided in this boxed set. If they're not, that's fine, but players might want to consider why their characters find themselves on an adventure in the unpredictable world of {@i Rick and Morty}—or not, and just be prepared for whatever weirdness comes their way!": "虽然规则手册为你提供了创建自己的角色所需的一切，但这次冒险假定玩家使用的是本盒装中提供的{@i Rick and Morty} {@adventure pregenerated characters|rmbre|0|Pregenerated Characters}。如果他们不使用，那也没关系，但玩家可能要考虑为什么他们的角色会在不可预测的{@i Rick and Morty}世界中发现自己的冒险--或者不使用，只要准备好迎接任何奇怪的事情就好了",

	"The Dungeon Master (DM) has a special role in the Dungeons & Dragons game.": "地下城管理员（DM）在龙与地下城游戏中有着特殊的作用。",
	"The DM is a {@b narrator}. The DM sets the pace of the story and presents the various challenges and encounters the players must overcome. The DM is the players' interface to the D&D world, as well as the one who reads (and sometimes also writes) the adventure and describes what happens in response to the characters' actions.": "DM是一个{@b narrator}。DM设定故事的节奏，提出玩家必须克服的各种挑战和遭遇。DM是玩家与D&D世界的接口，也是阅读（有时也写）冒险并描述对角色的行动所发生的事情的人。",
	"Although the DM controls the monsters and villains in the adventure, the relationship between the players and the DM isn't adversarial. The DM's job is to challenge the characters with interesting encounters and tests, keep the game moving, and apply the rules fairly.": "虽然DM控制着冒险中的怪物和恶棍，但玩家和DM之间的关系并不是对抗性的。DM的工作是用有趣的遭遇和测试来挑战角色，保持游戏的进行，并公平地应用规则。",
	"The most important thing to remember about being a good DM is that the rules are a tool to help you have a good time. The rules aren't in charge. You're the DM—you're in charge of the game. Guide the play experience and the use of the rules so that everybody has fun.": "要成为一个好的管理人，最重要的是要记住，规则是一个工具，帮助你有一个好的时间。规则并不负责任。你是管理员，你负责游戏。引导游戏体验和规则的使用，使每个人都有乐趣。",
	"Many players of Dungeons & Dragons find that being the DM is the best part of the game. With the information in this adventure, you'll be prepared to take on that role for your group.": "许多《龙与地下城》的玩家发现，当管理员是游戏中最好的部分。有了这个冒险中的信息，你将准备好为你的小组承担这个角色。",
	"Who should be the Dungeon Master for your group? Whoever wants to be! The person with the most drive to pull a group together and start a game often ends up being the DM, but that doesn't have to be the case.": "谁应该是你的小组的地下城主？谁想做就做。最有动力把小组召集在一起并开始游戏的人往往最终会成为管理员，但这不一定是事实。",
	"As the Dungeon Master, you are the final authority when it comes to rules questions or disputes during the game. Here are some guidelines to help you arbitrate issues as they come up.": "作为地下城管理员，当涉及到游戏中的规则问题或争议时，你是最终的权威。这里有一些准则，可以帮助你在出现问题时进行仲裁。",

	"{@b It's a shared story.} It's the group's story, so let the players contribute to the outcome through the actions of their characters. Dungeons & Dragons is about imagination and coming together to tell a story as a group. Let the players participate in the storytelling.": "{@b It's a shared story.}这是团体的故事，所以要让玩家通过他们的角色的行动对结果作出贡献。龙与地下城是关于想象力和作为一个团体来讲述一个故事。让玩家参与到讲故事中来。",

	"{@b Make sure everyone is involved.} Ensure every character has a chance to shine. If some players are reluctant to speak up, remember to ask them what their characters are doing.": "{@b Make sure everyone is involved.}确保每个角色都有机会发光发热。如果有些玩家不愿意发言，记得问他们的角色在做什么。",
	"{@b Be fair}. Use your powers as Dungeon Master only for good. Treat the rules and the players in a fair and impartial manner.": "{@b Be fair}. 使用你作为地下城管理员的权力只为了做好事。以公平和公正的方式对待规则和玩家。",
	"{@b Pay attention}. Make sure you look around the table occasionally to see if the game is going well. If everyone seems to be having fun, relax and keep going. If the fun is waning, it might be time for a break, or you can try to liven things up.": "{@b Pay attention}. 确保你偶尔环顾一下桌子，看看游戏是否进展顺利。如果每个人看起来都很开心，就放松并继续下去。如果乐趣减退，可能是休息的时候了，或者你可以试着让事情变得生动起来。",
	"The adventure often tells you what ability checks characters might try in a certain situation and the Difficulty Class (DC) of those checks. Sometimes adventurers try things that the adventure can't possibly anticipate. It's up to you to decide whether their attempts are successful. If it seems like anyone should have an easy time doing it, don't ask for an ability check; just tell the player what happens. Likewise, if there's no way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player it doesn't work.": "冒险通常会告诉你角色在某种情况下可能会尝试哪些能力检查，以及这些检查的难度等级（DC）。有时冒险者会尝试一些冒险中不可能预料到的事情。由你来决定他们的尝试是否成功。如果看起来任何人都应该很容易做到，就不要要求进行能力检查；只要告诉玩家会发生什么。同样地，如果任何人都不可能完成这个任务，就告诉玩家这是不可能的。",

Even with aptitude and training, a character needs some amount of luck—or a lot of specialized training—to pull off a hard task.": "{@b Hard (DC 20}). 艰巨的任务包括任何超出大多数人能力的努力，如果没有援助或特殊的能力。即使有能力和训练，一个角色也需要一定的运气或大量的专门训练来完成一项艰难的任务。",
	"The outcome of a successful check is usually easy to determine: the character succeeds at the attempted task. It's usually equally easy to figure out what happens when a character fails a check: the character simply doesn't succeed.": "检查成功的结果通常很容易确定：角色成功完成了尝试的任务。通常也很容易弄清楚当一个角色检查失败时会发生什么：这个角色根本没有成功。",
	"The inside of the folding screen included in this set has information that can help you while running the adventure. You can also use the screen to hide your notes and die rolls, thus keeping the players in suspense. Even though this DM screen has a {@i Rick and Morty} spin to the art, it is 100 percent serious DM business—no jokes there, just loads of valuable DM reference material.": "这套书中所包含的折叠屏幕的内部有一些信息，可以在运行冒险的时候帮助你。你也可以用这个屏幕来隐藏你的笔记和骰子，从而让玩家保持悬念。尽管这套DM屏风在艺术上有{@i Rick and Morty}的旋转，但它是百分之百的严肃的DM业务--那里没有笑话，只有大量有价值的DM参考资料。",
	"Map 1.1 shows the entire dungeon. This map is for your eyes only, providing insight into the dungeon's secrets and how encounters fit together. You probably don't want to share this map with the players, as it can spoil upcoming encounters. When characters arrive at a location marked on the map, you can either rely on a verbal description to give them a clear mental picture of the location, or you can draw what they see on a piece of graph paper, copying what's on your map while omitting details as appropriate. It's not important that your hand-drawn map perfectly match whats in the printed adventure. Focus on getting the shape and dimensions correct, and leave the rest to the players' imaginations.": "地图1.1显示了整个地牢的情况。这张地图仅供你观看，它提供了对地牢秘密的洞察力，以及遭遇战是如何组合的。你可能不想与玩家分享这张地图，因为它可能会破坏即将发生的遭遇。当角色到达地图上标记的地点时，你可以依靠口头描述来让他们对这个地点有一个清晰的印象，或者你可以把他们看到的东西画在一张图画纸上，复制地图上的内容，同时适当地省略一些细节。你的手绘地图是否与印刷的冒险中的内容完全一致并不重要。把重点放在形状和尺寸的正确性上，其余的留给玩家的想象力。",
	"The adventure uses terms that might be unfamiliar to you. Many of those are Rick's words, and you're on your own to figure them out. The most important D&D related ones, though, are described here.

Boxed text is most commonly used to describe rooms or present bits of scripted dialogue.": "在不同的地方，冒险中出现了描述性的文字，这些文字是为了让玩家朗读或转述的。这种朗读的文字是用方框来抵消的。框内文字最常用于描述房间或呈现一些脚本化的对话。",

	"It goes without saying, but this is a great dungeon. How did the characters get here? Who cares?! They're here now, and that's enough to deal with without dwelling on the past. Maybe this is all a bad dream, or some hallucination brought on by eating gnarly shrimp. Are there safe places to take rests? That's up to you, although I say no rest for the Ricked.": "不言而喻，这是个伟大的地牢。人物是如何来到这里的？谁在乎呢？他们现在在这里，这就足够了，不必纠结于过去。也许这都是一个噩梦，或者是吃了恶心的虾而产生的一些幻觉。有安全的地方可以休息吗？这取决于你，虽然我说瑞克德人没有休息。",
	"What about the treasure the characters find here, can they sell it anywhere? Are there things they spend their gold on? To that I say: Isn't the acquisition of treasure the best part? (Translation: There aren't any weird underground-dwelling vendors in here, no. But if the characters are persistent, perhaps some of these dank-ass dungeon denizens will deign to deal.)": "角色们在这里找到的财宝呢，他们能在哪里卖掉吗？他们是否有东西可以花掉他们的黄金？对此我要说。获得宝藏不是最好的部分吗？这里没有任何住在地下的奇怪小贩，没有。但是，如果人物坚持不懈，也许有些地牢里的人就会同意交易）。",

	"Rooms and hallways in the dungeon are made of rough-hewn stone. Ceilings are 20 feet high. Doors are made of wood and have AC 15, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

They're also not into humanoids, so don't try to seduce them.": "地牢中的房间和走廊是由粗凿的石头制成的。天花板有20英尺高。门是由木头制成的，有15点攻击力，20点命中率，对毒药和精神伤害有免疫力。除非某个区域的描述有说明，否则地牢里所有的门都是不上锁的。他们也不喜欢人类，所以不要试图勾引他们。",
	"Some of these rooms might seem a little cramped if you compare the activities inside to the map. But it's magic, so, like, the rooms are just sometimes bigger on the inside. I'm all about that D!

	"Oh, and once a room's been solved and passed, none of its features trigger again if the characters go back the way they came. Any monsters and NPCs hanging out in there might yell rude things, though.": "哦，一旦一个房间被解决并通过，如果角色从原路返回，它的任何功能都不会再次触发。不过，任何挂在那里的怪物和NPC都可能会大喊大叫，这很不礼貌。",
	"By the time they finish this dungeon, the characters should be 3rd level.

	"First of all, if the characters die in the dungeon, great. Working as intended. Second, if the characters die, the players also die in real life. Third, that was a joke—dead players are no fun for anybody. How are you supposed to lord your powers over corpses? Anyway, you can get creative about bringing back dead characters. One pro move is to take the dead character's sheet, cross out the old name, and write a new name with, like, one letter different from before. That's the player's new character, who suddenly steps in from the previous room! Carry on.": "首先，如果人物死在地牢里，很好。按计划进行。第二，如果角色死了，玩家在现实生活中也会死。第三，那是个笑话--死掉的玩家对任何人来说都不好玩。你怎么能把你的权力支配在尸体上呢？无论如何，你可以创造性地让死去的角色复活。有一个很好的办法是，把死去的角色的名单划掉，然后写一个新的名字，比如说，和以前不同的一个字母。这就是玩家的新角色，他突然从以前的房间里走了进来 继续下去。",

	"That's a good start, right? No taverns or want ads or wizards begging you to retrieve the Bauble of Blarglebop. Which, by the way, is actually completely worthless to the Blarglebopians. Total waste of your time.": "这是个好的开始，对吗？没有酒馆，没有招聘广告，也没有巫师求你找回布拉格勒布普的小饰品。顺便说一句，这对布拉格勒布普人来说其实是完全没有价值的。完全是在浪费你的时间。",

	"I wrote \"bunch\" in the description, but you should use at least three stirges.

	"When the characters enter or peek inside the room, read this description:": "当人物进入或窥视房间内部时，请阅读这段描述。",

	"This room is sort of trapezoidal, with doors to the east, north, and south. It's also got statues kind of scattered around—mostly statues of Rick with inscriptions like \"WOW!\" and \"DAMN!\" One of the statues depicts a woman in armor—really fine crafting, real interesting. Seems like a great artist worked hard on this one.": "这个房间有点像梯形，有门通往东、北和南。房间里还散布着一些雕像--主要是瑞克的雕像，上面刻着 \"哇！\"和 \"该死的！\"等字样。其中一个雕像描绘了一个穿着盔甲的女人--真的是精雕细琢，非常有趣。看来一位伟大的艺术家在这上面下了很大功夫。",
	"Most of the statues are pretty self-explanatory, but if a character examines the statue of the armored woman, read the following:": "大多数雕像都是不言自明的，但如果一个角色检查了盔甲女人的雕像，请阅读以下内容。",

Some of the spikes on the floor have skulls mounted on them.": "骷髅头退后了，你可以看到它只是一个骷髅头在叫喊。它浑身燃烧着火焰，眼窝里有小火球。窥视孔外的房间里有数百根金属钉子，从墙壁上向中间探出。地板上的一些钉子上安装着头骨。",

Roll on the Free Treasure table to determine what's inside.": "角落里的箱子是房间里唯一不是由宝石或贵金属制成的东西。除非你认为桦木是一种贵重金属--这样的话，你就错了。如果任何角色与宝箱互动，它就会急切地打开。\"带着我的祝福拿着这个！\"宝箱宣称。哇，这是个会说话的宝箱！\"。在自由宝藏表上滚动，以确定里面有什么。",

Shame on them.": "每当蝴蝶落在一个角色身上，该角色就会恢复1点生命值。在队伍进入房间后不久，让一只蝴蝶落在一个受伤的角色身上来说明这一点。此后，角色可以通过成功的DC 5智慧（{@skill Animal Handling}）检查来哄骗蝴蝶落在他们身上--多么可爱啊! 如果有人攻击这些蝴蝶，它们都会消失。他们真可耻。",
	"If a character sniffs one of the flowers, it smells ever so nice. If they pick one and carry it with them, that character has advantage on Charisma checks and Charisma saving throws for the next 24 hours.": "如果一个角色嗅到了其中一朵花，它就会闻到非常好的味道。如果他们摘下一朵并带在身上，在接下来的24小时内，该人物在魅力检查和魅力救赎上有优势。",

	"Hey Dungeon Master! Ooh boy, Rick's really done it this time! There's an multiplanar intergalactic entity that's been stalking him for a while—tale as old as time, right?

	"Once a character picks up the xylobone mallets, the skeletons run to other nearby bone instruments: two guitars, a drum set, an upright bass, and a saxobone. The skeletons beckon to the other characters, encouraging them to play other instruments. Once everyone is in place, the bone jam session begins! Have each character playing an instrument make a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Performance}) check. If all the characters succeed, the jam session sounds amazing! If any of the characters fail, one of the skeletons comes over to wordlessly give advice on how to play better. Have that character make the check again. If they succeed, the skeleton rejoices. If they fail again, the skeleton gently takes the instrument, exchanging it for something the character can't f*** up—like bone maracas or a skull toot-jug.": "一旦一个角色拿起了xylobone木槌，这些骷髅就会跑到附近的其他骨质乐器上：两把吉他、一个架子鼓、一个立式贝司和一个萨克斯管。骷髅们向其他角色招手，鼓励他们演奏其他乐器。一旦每个人都就位，骨头演奏会就开始了! 让每个演奏乐器的角色进行DC15魅力（{@skill Performance}）检查。如果所有的角色都成功了，那么演奏会的声音就会很好听。如果任何一个角色失败了，其中一个骷髅就会走过来，无声地给如何演奏得更好的建议。让那个角色再次进行检查。如果他们成功了，骷髅就会欢欣鼓舞。如果他们再次失败，骷髅就会轻轻地拿走乐器，用它来换取这个角色不能搞砸的东西，比如骨制马拉卡琴或骷髅头酒杯。",

	"To placate her, the entire party must assuage her grieving maternal instinct. How they do so is up to them, but the easiest way is to disguise themselves as owlbear cublets (using feathers and clumps of fur, easily found in the nest) and get cozy with their new mom.

The experience is actually quite pleasant.": "为了安抚她，整个队伍必须安抚她悲痛的母性本能。如何做到这一点由他们自己决定，但最简单的方法是把自己伪装成猫头鹰小熊（使用羽毛和毛发团，在巢穴中很容易找到），与新妈妈亲密接触。这让猫头鹰熊很高兴，它立即把它们引入巢中，用它那锋利的喙为它们彻底梳理。这种经历实际上是相当愉快的。",

	"Long story short, I let myself get captured by a real piece-of-s*** multidimensional entity (and not that you asked, but its name is Chad). It's been horny to capture me and put my brain in a jar for, like, twenty years now. Thanks to your distraction, I sabotaged its WHOLE s*** and sent it spiraling back through the last few dozen dimensions it's wormed its way through. So needless to say, it won't be bothering me again anytime soon.": "长话短说，我让自己被一个真正的多维实体（不是你问的，而是它的名字叫查德）俘获。它一直想抓住我，把我的大脑放在一个罐子里，好像已经有二十年了。由于你的分心，我破坏了它的整个****，使它在过去的几十个维度中螺旋式上升，它在其中蠕动。所以不用说，它很快就不会再打扰我了。",

Lucky!": "从传送门出来的角色会发现自己坐在史密斯家族餐厅的桌子旁--包括肉脸，他当然是我们心目中的家族朋友，也是我们多年来都很喜欢的角色。那些没有走出地牢的人发现自己几乎立即被压死了，他们在现实生活中死亡。但值得庆幸的是，只是在一个特定的维度，而不是这个维度。幸运的是!",

	"A magic item's description explains how the item works. Handling a magic item is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about the item. Casting the {@spell identify} spell on the item then reveals its properties. Alternatively, a character can concentrate on the item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item's properties. Potions are an exception; a taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.": "一个魔法物品的描述解释了该物品如何工作。处理一件魔法物品足以让角色感觉到该物品的不寻常之处。对该物品施展{@spell identify}的法术，就会显示出它的特性。或者，一个角色可以在短暂的休息中集中精力于该物品，同时与该物品保持身体接触。在休息结束时，角色会了解到该物品的属性。药水是个例外；品尝一下就能告诉品尝者药水的作用。",

	"The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. This space is not a measure of the creature's physical dimensions.
