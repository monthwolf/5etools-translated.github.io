	"\"A historian interrogates the stories we tell ourselves about the past, learning how true they are—or otherwise,\" lectures Dean Tullus. \"Only by understanding the truth of the past might we learn lessons applicable to our magic in the present. Take this, for example.\" The professor reveals a translucent orb. Within it a coil of green mist endlessly knots around itself. \"I unearthed this in the Fortress Badlands during my most recent expedition. Its creator and use remain uncertain. But by investigating the reason for its creation, we stand to learn more about those who made it and how their lessons might teach us more about our own magic.\"": "\"历史学家审视我们告诉自己的关于过去的故事，了解它们的真实性--或其他方面，\"图卢斯院长讲道。\"只有通过了解过去的真相，我们才可能学到适用于我们现在的魔法的教训。以这个为例。\" 教授展示了一个半透明的球体。在它里面，一卷绿色的雾气无休止地围绕着自己打结。\"我在最近的探险中在要塞荒地发掘了这个。它的创造者和用途仍然不确定。但通过调查它的创造原因，我们可以更多地了解制造它的人，以及他们的教训如何能让我们更多地了解我们自己的魔法。\"",
	"Dean Tullus eagerly takes questions on her lecture or the relic she exhibits, but she doesn't know much about it yet. She suspects it was used as a magical focus by an ancient wizard she has yet to identify. A character who subtly casts {@spell detect magic} in class learns the object exudes an aura of enchantment.": "Tullus院长热切地接受关于她的讲座或她所展示的遗物的问题，但她对它还不是很了解。她怀疑它是被一个她还没有确定的古代巫师用作魔法焦点。一个在课堂上巧妙地施展{@spell detect magic}的角色得知该物品散发着一种魔法的光环。",

	"To meet Dean Tullus's demand for historical authenticity, a character must research Strixhaven fashion through the centuries.

	"A character who excels at their fashion research notices a gap in the Biblioplex's records approximately 200 years ago. All information about that year's masquerade is missing. If a character pursues the missing information, cross-checking other university records reveals an unusually high number of student deaths that same year. While Strixhaven experiences the occasional rare fatality among the student body, that year dozens of students perished. No available record notes how the students died. Characters who, in {@adventure chapter 4|SCC-HfMT|0|Quenthorne's History}, learned about the student expelled for practicing forbidden magic realize that these deaths occurred in the same year that student was expelled. Beyond this, no other information on the topic is currently available.": "一个擅长时尚研究的人物注意到了大约200年前Biblioplex记录中的一个空白。所有关于那一年的化妆舞会的信息都不见了。如果一个角色追问缺失的信息，交叉检查其他大学的记录，发现同年的学生死亡人数异常之多。虽然斯特里克斯海文的学生中偶尔会出现罕见的死亡事件，但那一年有几十个学生死亡。没有可用的记录指出这些学生是如何死亡的。在{@adventure chapter 4|SCC-HfMT|0|Quenthorne's History}中了解到因练习禁忌魔法而被开除的学生的人物意识到，这些死亡发生在该学生被开除的同一年。除此以外，目前没有关于这个主题的其他信息。",

	"The Magister's Masquerade is such a Strixhaven institution that an entire section of the Biblioplex's archives is devoted to it. Along with records about the event, these archives serve as storage for masquerade supplies needed annually. The characters are among those students the masquerade organizing committee tasks with retrieving the hundreds of storage boxes conveying them to Kollema Hall. Ten other students (apprentices from all five colleges; see {@book chapter 7|SCC|8} for their stat blocks) are sent along with the characters.": "魔法师的化妆舞会是斯特里克斯海文的一个机构，以至于图书馆的档案室有一整块地方专门用来记录它。除了有关活动的记录外，这些档案还用来储存每年所需的化装舞会用品。这些人物是化装舞会组织委员会的学生之一，他们的任务是取回数百个储存箱，把它们送到科勒玛大厅。另外十名学生（来自所有五个学院的学徒，他们的状态块见{@book chapter 7|SCC|8}）和这些人物一起被派去。",
	"Finding all the supplies related to the Magister's Masquerade, moving them out of the archives, and then transporting them to Kollema Hall should take the characters and their group 6 hours to complete. That assumes everyone in the group helps the entire time and someone arranges for transportation of the supplies. If one or more characters refuse to help or slip away for part of the time, add 1 hour to the task's duration. If the characters don't arrange transportation in advance, the task stalls until they make arrangements.": "找到所有与法师的化妆舞会有关的物资，把它们从档案馆里搬出来，然后把它们运到科勒玛大厅，应该需要人物和他们的小组花6个小时来完成。假设小组中的每个人都全程帮忙，并且有人安排了物资的运输。如果有一个或多个角色拒绝帮忙或在部分时间内溜走，则在任务时间上增加1小时。如果角色没有提前安排运输，任务就会停滞，直到他们做出安排。",
	"The records in the Biblioplex archives weren't available to the characters when they were doing their historical research earlier in the academic year (see \"{@adventure Records Gap|SCC-TMM|0|Records Gap}\" earlier in the chapter). A character who ignores their manual labor duties for an hour and investigates the archive records can make a DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill History}) check.

Dozens of students fell victim to it, experiencing fatigue and headaches; many of them died, wasting away in a matter of days despite all efforts to cure them.": "当人物在学年早些时候进行历史研究时，Biblioplex档案馆里的记录并不是他们可以得到的（见本章前面的\"{@adventure Records Gap|SCC-TMM|0|Records Gap}\"）。忽略他们的体力劳动任务一小时并调查档案记录的人物可以进行DC14智力（{@skill History}）检查。如果他们成功了，他们会发现一份200年前的第一手报告，其中涉及一种袭击校园的神秘疾病。数十名学生成为它的受害者，出现疲劳和头痛；其中许多人在几天内死亡，尽管所有的努力都能治愈他们。",
	"The characters' second Exam in Advanced Arcane History takes place a short while after they complete the errands in preparation for the masquerade.

	"Students don't need to present their invitations to gain admittance to the masquerade, but they are expected to check in. All third-year students and their guests are admitted to the ball, so long as they're wearing appropriate attire.

	"When the characters arrive, they have time to socialize, take in other students' costumes, and meet up with acquaintances they recognize. While characters easily recognize each other, nearly everyone at the masquerade is wearing a magical disguise.

	"If a character failed to notice the faulty device in the \"{@adventure Firebreak|SCC-TMM|0|Firebreak}\" event earlier in the chapter, or noticed it but did nothing about it, the device explodes when activated. The explosion happens in the quadrant of Kollema Hall's first floor with the largest number of characters. Everyone in that quarter of the hall must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or have starry embers burn small holes into their attire. Creatures are otherwise unharmed.

	"As the dean finishes her speech, the magic placed on the Kollema Hall demonstration stage activates. Anyone who enters a space on or above the stage gains a fly speed equal to their walking speed. This allows the guests to literally dance on air. Anyone who leaves the space above the dance floor in midair drifts gently to an unoccupied space in {@adventure area K1|SCC-TMM|0|K1. Serenity Quadrants}. This magic lasts until the end of the masquerade.": "当院长完成她的演讲时，放置在科勒玛大厅演示台上的魔法启动了。任何进入舞台上或上方空间的人都会获得与他们行走速度相等的飞行速度。这让客人们可以真正地在空中跳舞。任何在半空中离开舞池上方空间的人，都会轻轻地漂移到{@adventure area K1|SCC-TMM|0|K1.

	"Use the Magister's Masquerade as an opportunity to heighten the characters' suspicions about Dean Tullus. After her welcome announcement, Dean Tullus grows distant.

	"\"Students of Strixhaven,\" Wise Kollema says in a voice that booms through the hall, yet echoes as if coming from afar. \"Always remember the chain of which you are a part. Wisdom is shared, learned, added to, and passed on. Links are added and lost, but the chain of tradition connects us all—those of us who were, who are, and who are yet to come. You are bonded, students of Strixhaven, to one another and to those you'll never know. Never doubt the wondrousness of what you've learned or the remarkable place you hold as the link between the past and the future. This night, we are one community, knowing no boundaries of role, college, or time.\"": "\"Strixhaven的学生们，\"Wise Kollema用一种在大厅里响起的声音说，但又像从远处传来的一样回声。\"永远记住你是其中的一个环节。智慧被分享、学习、补充和传递。链接被添加和丢失，但传统的链条连接着我们所有人--我们过去的人，现在的人，以及未来的人。斯特里克斯海文的学生们，你们彼此相连，也与那些你们永远不知道的人相连。永远不要怀疑你们所学到的东西的奇妙之处，也不要怀疑你们作为连接过去和未来的纽带所拥有的非凡地位。这个夜晚，我们是一个团体，没有角色、学院或时间的界限。\"",

	"\"But be warned!\" the statue of Kollema unexpectedly continues. \"There is a harsh lesson you have yet to learn. When the mistakes of the past are forgotten, that dire past will return to haunt the present. Beware, mages, of the shadow that reaches for you even now.\"": "\"但请注意！\"科勒玛的雕像意外地继续说。\"有一个严厉的教训你还没有学会。当过去的错误被遗忘时，那段可怕的过去会回到现在来纠缠。小心，法师们，即使是现在也要小心那伸向你们的阴影。\"",
	"The hall falls into silence as the voice of Kollema fades, followed by muttering and the jarringly jaunty notes of the band playing anew.

Beyond office supplies, books on military history (all scribed in the tactile lettering that Plargg invented), and Plargg's awards, the only thing of interest in the room is one of the dean's prized discoveries.": "普拉格院长是这间办公室的主人，与图卢斯院长共同负责罗尔霍德的院长工作。这位粗鲁的兽人教授专门研究军事历史，并以其对无数战役和历史事件的完美回忆而闻名。除了办公用品、军事历史书籍（都是用普拉格发明的触觉字体书写）和普拉格的奖项外，房间里唯一值得关注的是院长的一个珍贵发现。",
	"Hanging behind Plargg's desk is a {@item mace of smiting} with a round head and a grip wrapped in thick red rope. If a character takes this item and any Lorehold faculty member sees them using it, the faculty member confiscates it and returns it to this office.": "在普拉格的办公桌后面挂着一个圆头的{@item mace of smiting}，握柄上缠着粗大的红绳。如果一个角色拿了这个东西，而任何罗尔霍德的教员看到他们在使用它，教员会没收它并把它送回这个办公室。",
	"A bronze nameplate on the door to this room reads \"Augusta Tullus, Dean of Order.\"": "这个房间的门上有一块青铜铭牌，上面写着 \"奥古斯塔-图卢斯，秩序院长\"。",
	"The desk in this office is barely visible beneath heaps of books, papers, and knick-knacks. Every shelf and one of the room's three chairs have similar burdens.": "这间办公室的办公桌在成堆的书籍、文件和小玩意下面几乎看不到。每个书架和房间里的三把椅子中的一把都有类似的负担。",
	"Dean Tullus's office is messy and unoccupied. Characters who search her desk find little more than writing supplies and ungraded student essays.": "Tullus院长的办公室很乱，没有人。搜查她办公桌的人发现除了写作用品和未评分的学生作文外，没有其他东西。",
	"A character who spends 10 minutes sifting through the papers in the room and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check discovers log entries from Dean Tullus's last expedition to the Fortress Badlands. The following notes stand out among them:": "花10分钟翻阅房间里的文件，并在DC12智力({@skill Investigation})检查中成功的角色发现了图拉斯院长最后一次远征荒地堡垒的日志记录。在这些记录中，下面的笔记很突出。",

	"\"Little progress today. Headache making it difficult to focus.\"": "\"今天进展不大。头痛使其难以集中注意力。\"",
	"\"Found myself arguing with the team. Blaming headaches and lack of sleep.\"": "\"发现自己在和团队争论。归咎于头疼和睡眠不足。\"",
	"\"Convinced the glass orb doesn't originate from the badlands inhabitants. More modern? Magic is strange.\"": "\"确信这个玻璃球不是源自坏境居民的。更现代？魔法很奇怪。\"",
	"\"Departing expedition early. Frustrated with team. Eager to investigate orb at Strixhaven's facilities.\"": "\"提前离开探险队。对团队感到沮丧。渴望在Strixhaven的设施中调查球体。\"",
	"\"Home again, home again. Home again, home again. Home again, home again.\"": "\"再次回家，再次回家。又回家了，又回家了。又回家了，又回家了。\"",
	"The final note is repeated dozens of times on the back of the log. The handwriting is also clearly not the same as Tullus's cramped script, being a heavier scrawl.": "最后的说明在日志的背面重复了几十次。笔迹也显然与图卢斯的狭窄字体不一样，是比较重的潦草字迹。",
	"Ancient books and flaking scrolls fill the racks lining the walls of this musty records room. A large case stands along the wall opposite the door.": "在这间发霉的记录室里，古书和剥落的卷轴摆满了墙上的架子。一个大箱子沿着门对面的墙立着。",
	"This room holds documents detailing the research of Lorehold's deans, past and present. While some of the work here contains fascinating historical discoveries, there's little of value to the characters.": "这个房间存放着详细记录罗尔霍德过去和现在的院长们的研究的文件。虽然这里的一些工作包含了迷人的历史发现，但对人物没有什么价值。",
	"The final encounter with Dean Tullus and the forces manipulating her occurs in the Deans' Repository, depicted on map 5.4.": "与图卢斯院长和操纵她的势力的最后遭遇发生在地图5.4所描述的院长储藏室。",
	"When the character enter the Deans' Repository, read:": "当人物进入院长库时，请阅读。",
	"The portal opens into a richly decorated library filled with floor-to-ceiling shelves packed with books and archaeological relics. Four long worktables occupy the room's center, each covered with papers and dirt-encrusted stonework. Stone statues of dragons stare from between the shelves, and at the room's far end, wing-backed chairs face a crackling fireplace.": "入口打开后是一个装饰丰富的图书馆，从地板到天花板的书架上堆满了书籍和考古文物。四张长长的工作台占据了房间的中心位置，每张桌子上都铺满了纸张和布满灰尘的石块。龙的石雕从书架之间凝视着，在房间的远端，翼背椅面对着一个噼里啪啦的壁炉。",
	"The Deans' Repository is a spacious extradimensional library. The only passage leading to or from it is the portal on the wall opposite the fireplace. This portal is the duplicate of the one in {@adventure area L9|SCC-TMM|0|L9. Deans' Records Room} of the Deans' Wing.": "院长的资料库是一个宽敞的次元图书馆。通往它的唯一通道是壁炉对面墙上的入口。这个传送门是院长之翼{@adventure area L9|SCC-TMM|0|L9. Deans' Records Room}中的传送门的复制品。",
	"Her face lit by the eerie green light of the glass orb she holds, Dean Tullus says, \"You shouldn't have come. Ancient ones, take them!\" Four of the statues around the room respond, their eyes flaring with amber light.": "她的脸被她手中的玻璃球的阴森绿光照亮，图卢斯院长说：\"你不应该来。古老的人，带着他们！\" 房间周围的四座雕像作出回应，它们的眼睛闪烁着琥珀色的光芒。",
	"In the course of the battle, Tullus speaks mechanically, making threatening declarations such as \"You can't stop what's coming.\" A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check can tell the dean doesn't seem like herself.": "在战斗过程中，图鲁斯机械地说话，发出威胁性的声明，如 \"你无法阻止即将发生的事情\"。通过DC12智慧({@skill Insight})检查成功的人物可以看出院长似乎并不像自己。",
	"On the worktables lie five nonmagical historical relics from Dean Tullus's and Dean Plargg's ongoing research. These dusty objects—mostly mundane stone or jade vessels—are each worth 100 gp.": "工作台上摆放着五件来自图卢斯院长和普拉格院长正在进行的研究的非魔法历史遗物。这些尘封的物品--主要是世俗的石头或玉器--每件价值100金币。",
	"When Dean Tullus is defeated, {@item Murgaxor's orb|SCC} flares with sickly green light and emits a blast of noxious wind. All creatures within 10 feet of the orb must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from the orb. Read or paraphrase the following text:": "当Tullus院长被打败时，{@item Murgaxor's orb|SCC}会发出病态的绿光，并散发出一阵毒风。所有在球体10英尺范围内的生物都必须在DC16力量救赎中成功，否则将被推离球体10英尺远。阅读或解读以下文字。",
	"A hazy image of a figure appears, hovering above the green, glowing orb. The ominous shape wears hooded black robes, which disguise all but the figure's warty, green hands and broad, frog-like mouth.": "一个朦胧的身影出现了，盘旋在绿色发光的球体之上。这个不祥的身影穿着蒙面的黑袍，除了那双长满疣子的绿手和宽大的、像青蛙一样的嘴，其他的都被掩盖了。",
	"\"Worthless, pathetic meddlers!\" the figure croaks. \"I won't have my plans thwarted again! I'll have my vengeance on Strixhaven soon enough. You all will pay!\"": "\"无用的、可悲的多管闲事的人！\"这个人物呱呱叫。\"我不会再让我的计划受挫了！\"。我很快就会向斯特里克斯港报仇。你们都要付出代价！\"",
	"This is {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}, a wizard long ago expelled from Strixhaven for practicing deadly magic. He's been controlling Dean Tullus through the orb she discovered, using it to channel his magic from afar. Now that Tullus has been thwarted, {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} seeks to carry out his revenge himself. {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} is a bombastic foe, though. Should the characters insult or question him, he gloats about his schemes in the following ways:": "这是{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}，一个很久以前因为练习致命的魔法而被驱逐出斯特里克斯港的巫师。他一直通过她发现的球体控制着迪安-图卢斯，用它从远处引导他的魔法。现在，图卢斯被挫败了，{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}试图亲自进行报复。不过，{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}是一个狂热的敌人。如果人物侮辱或质疑他，他就会以下列方式对他的计划幸灾乐祸。",
	"\"You should already know the name {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} Grenshel! It should be recorded as the name of the greatest mage Strixhaven has ever known. Instead those cowards blotted it out—struck it from the pages of history! But soon all the world will know my name!\"": "\"你应该已经知道{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}Grenshel这个名字! 它应该被记录为斯特里克斯港有史以来最伟大的法师的名字。但那些懦夫却把它抹去了--把它从历史的书页上抹去了! 但很快全世界都会知道我的名字！\"",

	"\"Bah! Manipulating those pawns was only the beginning!\"": "\"呸！操纵这些棋子只是一个开始！\"",
	"\"You've confounded my plots—now for the last time!\"": "\"你扰乱了我的阴谋--现在是最后一次了！\"",
	"After some banter—or if the characters get a good insult in on him—{@creature Murgaxor|SCC} shouts in frustration. In response, the image of {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} vanishes and the orb cracks, releasing a threat from within.": "在一番戏谑之后--或者如果角色们对他进行了很好的侮辱--{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}沮丧地大叫。作为回应，{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}的形象消失了，球体裂开了，从里面释放出一个威胁。",
	"After {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}'s image vanishes, the cracked orb releases a cloud of mist that transforms into an entity composed of equal parts noxious wind and crackling green energy. This creature uses the {@creature air elemental} stat block, except its Slam attack deals necrotic damage instead of bludgeoning damage. The creature fights until destroyed. When reduced to 0 hit points, the creature is drawn back into the cracked orb. The orb glows brightly for 1 minute, after which it releases another such creature with full hit points.": "在{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}的影像消失后，裂开的球体释放出一团雾气，变成一个由同等数量的毒风和噼啪作响的绿色能量组成的实体。这个生物使用{@creature air elemental}的状态块，除了它的猛击造成坏死的伤害而不是重击伤害。该生物会一直战斗直到被摧毁。当生命值降至0时，该生物会被拉回裂纹球体中。球体发光1分钟，之后会释放出另一个具有完整命中率的此类生物。",
	"If Dean Tullus survives her confrontation with the characters, she's free of {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}'s influence and grateful to these resourceful students. She covers for the characters when other faculty members ask about any strangeness (or missing possessions) in the Deans' Wing.": "如果图卢斯院长在与这些人物的对峙中幸存下来，她就摆脱了{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}的影响，并对这些足智多谋的学生表示感谢。当其他教职员工问起院长楼里的任何奇怪现象（或丢失的财产）时，她为这些人物打掩护。",
	"After their encounter with {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}, the characters likely realize that the evil mage has had a hand in numerous threats the characters have experienced, both during this academic year and before.": "在与{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}相遇后，人物很可能意识到这个邪恶的法师与人物所经历的众多威胁都有关系，无论是在本学年还是之前。",
	"Dean Tullus makes sure the rest of the faculty knows about {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}'s threat to the university—a threat every professor takes seriously. Although the faculty is inclined to conceal this information from the student body for the time being (to avoid panic), the characters might learn through Dean Tullus or another professor what they couldn't learn through research: that a Strixhaven student named {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} was expelled long ago for using life-draining magic on his fellow students. {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} was thought defeated, but clearly, he has somehow returned. The university staff doesn't have any more information than that, but they encourage the characters to remain wary.": "Tullus院长确保其他教师知道{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}对大学的威胁--每个教授都很重视这个威胁。虽然教师们倾向于暂时向学生们隐瞒这一信息（以避免恐慌），但角色们可能会通过图卢斯院长或其他教授了解到他们无法通过研究了解到的信息：一个名叫（%%1）的Strixhaven学生很久以前就因为对他的同学使用消耗生命的魔法而被开除。{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}被认为被打败了，但显然，他以某种方式回来了。大学工作人员没有更多的信息，但他们鼓励人物保持警惕。",
	"If this adventure marks the end of your Strixhaven campaign, the school's administrators thank the characters for ending {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}'s threat and promise to destroy any remnants of the evil mage's magic.": "如果这次冒险标志着你的Strixhaven战役的结束，那么学校的管理人员会感谢角色们结束了{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}的威胁，并承诺会摧毁这个邪恶法师的任何魔法残余。",
	"The academic year soon draws to a peaceful close. Give the characters an opportunity to wrap up any remaining plans they still have, but in a scant few days classes end, the dormitories close, and the characters have a several-month-long break before the beginning of their fourth and final year at Strixhaven.": "学年很快就会平静地结束。给人物一个机会来结束他们仍然有的任何剩余计划，但在短短的几天里，课程结束，宿舍关闭，人物在开始他们在Strixhaven的第四年和最后一年之前有一个长达数月的休息时间。",
	"With the adventure's end, each character advances to 8th level.": "随着冒险的结束，每个角色都升到了8级。"
