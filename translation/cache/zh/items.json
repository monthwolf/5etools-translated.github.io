Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao -potentially for the final time.": "很久以前，宁静的拉奥神创造了一个工具，以保护他的新生信徒免受下层世界的邪恶之害。然而，随着岁月的流逝，凡人开发了他们自己的方法来处理存在的威胁，这把钩子基本上被遗忘了。不过，在最近的年代里，拉奥的钩子被重新发现，并被用来对付巫婆女王伊格威夫（巫师塔莎的名字之一）的崛起。虽然她被打败了，但伊格威夫在战斗中设法损坏了羊角，使其感染了一个阴险的诅咒--以及未来胜利的可能性。事后，这把钩子再次丢失。偶尔它也会重新出现，但这个著名的神器已经不是原来的样子了。无论神器的持有者是否意识到它的全部威胁，很少有人冒险使用拉奥古克--可能是最后一次。",

The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.": "在过去的岁月里，在克莱恩世界，精灵和人类与邪恶的龙展开了一场可怕的战争。当世界似乎注定要毁灭时，高阶巫术塔的巫师们聚集在一起，施展他们最伟大的魔法，铸造了五个龙族之球（或称龙族之球）来帮助他们打败龙。五座塔中的每一座都有一个龙珠，在那里它们被用来加速战争的胜利结束。巫师们用龙珠把龙引到他们身边，然后用强大的魔法消灭龙。",
	"As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.": "随着高阶巫术之塔在后世的衰落，这些球体被摧毁或淡出了传说，只有三个被认为幸存下来。几个世纪以来，它们的魔力被扭曲了，所以尽管它们召唤龙的主要目的仍然有效，但它们也允许对龙进行某种程度的控制。",
	"Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.": "每个球体都包含一条恶龙的精华，这种存在对任何试图从它身上哄骗魔法的行为都很反感。那些缺乏人格力量的人可能会发现自己被球体所奴役。",
	"An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.": "球体是一个直径约为10英寸的蚀刻水晶球。使用时，它的直径会增长到20英寸左右，雾气会在它里面旋转。",
	"While you are {@condition charmed} by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts {@spell suggestion} on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis ({@creature Tiamat|RoT|Tiamat's} name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides.": "当你被球体控制的时候，你不能主动结束对它的调和，球体会随意对你施放（1%），敦促你为它所期望的邪恶目的而努力。球体中的龙的本质可能想要很多东西：消灭一个特定的民族，从球体中获得自由，在这个世界上散播痛苦，推进对塔克西丝（{@creature Tiamat|RoT|Tiamat's}克莱恩的名字）的崇拜，或者其他由DM决定的东西。",
	"An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties:": "一个龙族的球体具有以下随机属性。",

	"This common wondrous item is a hollow, 5-inch-diameter orb that weighs 5 pounds. Its outer shell is composed of notched bronze rings, which can be turned so that the notches line up. Aligning the notches requires an action, and doing so causes the orb to gong loudly until the notches are no longer aligned. The sounds are spaced 6 seconds apart and can be heard out to a range of 600 feet.": "这种常见的奇妙物品是一个空心的、直径5英寸的球体，重达5磅。它的外壳是由有凹槽的青铜环组成，可以转动，使凹槽对齐。对齐凹槽需要一个动作，这样做会使球体发出响亮的锣声，直到凹槽不再对齐。声音的间隔为6秒，可以在600英尺的范围内听到。",

	"As an action, you can channel the orb's magic to hold your ground. For the next minute or until you move any distance, you have advantage on all checks and saving throws to resist effects that force you to move. In addition, any enemy that moves to a space within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be unable to move any farther this turn.": "作为一个动作，你可以引导球体的魔力来保持你的位置。在接下来的一分钟里，或者在你移动任何距离之前，你在抵御迫使你移动的效果的所有检查和蓄力上都有优势。此外，任何移动到你10英尺范围内的敌人都必须在DC12力量投掷中获得成功，否则本回合将无法移动更远。",

	"You can transfer the orb's magic to a nonmagical item—a shield or a pair of boots—by tracing the stein rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the orb is destroyed, and the rune appears in silver on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:": "你可以将球体的魔力转移到非魔法物品上--盾牌或一双靴子--通过用手指描画那里的斯坦因符文。转移需要8个小时的工作，要求两件物品彼此在5英尺以内。最后，球体被摧毁，符文以银色出现在所选物品上，物品根据其形态获得好处。",

	"This spherical chunk of granite is about the size of a human fist. The stein rune—the rune of stone—appears on the orb as crystalline veins that play across its surface. When first grasped, the stone feels impossibly heavy, as if even a titan could not lift it. That feeling passes after a moment, allowing you to carry the stone with ease.": "这块球形的花岗岩大约有一个人的拳头大小。斯坦因符文--石头的符文--出现在球体上，成为贯穿其表面的晶莹脉络。初次握住时，这块石头感觉不可能那么重，仿佛即使是泰坦也无法举起它。这种感觉一会儿就过去了，让你能轻松地拿起石头。",
	"As an action, you scribe the stein rune onto the ground at your feet. Until you move, you have advantage on all ability checks and saving throws to resist effects that would force you to move. In addition, any creature that moves within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or have its movement immediately end.": "作为一个动作，你将钢杯符文刻在你脚下的地上。在你移动之前，你在所有的能力检查和抵抗会迫使你移动的效果的蓄力投掷上都有优势。此外，任何在你10英尺范围内移动的生物都必须在DC12力量投掷中获得成功，否则其移动将立即结束。",

	"You have advantage on Wisdom checks to find hidden doors and paths.": "你在寻找隐藏的门和路径的智慧检查上有优势。",
	"The orb is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the orb, keeping it on your person at all times. All nonmagical flames within 30 feet of you automatically extinguish, and fire damage dealt by you is halved.": "这个球体是被诅咒的，成为它的附庸会使诅咒延伸到你身上。只要你还被诅咒，你就不愿意与球体分离，并一直将它带在身上。在你周围30英尺内的所有非魔法火焰都会自动熄灭，你所受到的火灾伤害也会减半。",
	"While holding this orb, you can use an action to determine whether it is morning, afternoon, evening, or nighttime outside. This property functions only on the Material Plane.": "当持有这个球体时，你可以使用一个动作来确定外面是早上、下午、晚上还是晚上。这个属性只在物质界发挥作用。",

	"The Orrery of the Wanderer was created by a renowned clockwork mage known only as Lottie. She crafted the relic as a means of tapping into the power of the planes, and to channel the divination and foretelling powers of the stars. But Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended. As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm.": "漫游者的圣物是由一位著名的钟表法师创造的，他只知道是洛蒂。她制作了这个遗物，作为挖掘星球力量的一种手段，并引导星星的占卜和预言能力。但洛蒂很快就意识到，她的作品比她想象的要强大得多。随着它对星球魔力的挖掘，手镯开始表现出一些星球固有的黑暗和恶意。最终，它将给它的主人留下一个愿望，那就是打开进入最受诅咒和最危险世界的门户，包括远界。",
	"To prevent the orrery from ever being so used, Lottie scattered the components that powered it, secreting them across the world.

	"Soul coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.": "灵魂硬币是由玛门和他的大恶魔们在九层地狱的第三层米瑙罗斯创造的，在一个巨大的密室里，邪恶的凡人的灵魂被束缚在硬币里。这些硬币随后被分发到整个九层地狱，用于购买商品和服务，进行无间道交易，进行黑暗交易和贿赂。",

	"This glass bottle can store one spell of up to 5th level at a time.

	"If you're holding the empty bottle when you see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet of you, you can open the bottle as a reaction in an attempt to interrupt the spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle.": "如果你拿着这个空瓶子，当你看到一个生物在你周围60英尺内施法时，你可以作为反应打开瓶子，试图打断这个法术。如果该生物正在施放3级或更低的法术，则该法术没有效果，并被储存在瓶子里。如果它施放的是四级或更高级别的法术，请进行智力测验。智力值等于10 + 咒语的等级。如果成功，该咒语没有效果，并被储存在瓶子里。",

For example, you may add doors, seal windows, change the arrangement of rooms, or even dispel a structure created by a keystone. To do so, you must concentrate for 1 minute, as if on a spell, while picturing the changes you wish to make in your mind; over the course of that minute, the changes slowly occur.

The aboleth is incensed by the stone's destruction, and it attacks all other creatures it can see.": "在石头形态下，{@creature aboleth}不是生物，也不会受到针对生物的效果。Golorr之石对所有的伤害都是免疫的。如果选择了反感效果，并且该咒语是针对驱除畸形物的，那么对石头施放(1%)的咒语会破坏它。当法术以这种方式施放时，石头会变成粘液并被摧毁，Aboleth Golorr会出现在石头残骸30英尺内的一个无人空间。阿波勒斯因为石头的毁灭而被激怒，它攻击所有它能看到的其他生物。",

	"Explorers who discovered the crash site removed the command console and brought it back to civilization, not understanding its true purpose or powers. In later years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum.

Yet with Lum's eventual defeat, his great machine was destroyed.": "发现坠机地点的探险家们移走了指挥台，并将其带回了文明社会，但他们并不了解其真正的目的和能力。在后来的日子里，这个控制台落入了卢姆男爵的手中。通过对它的许多控制装置进行实验，他能够在建设他的帝国的过程中实现惊人的破坏性魔法效果，因此这件文物被称为 \"疯子卢姆的地狱机器\"。然而，随着卢姆的最终失败，他的伟大机器也被摧毁。",

	"The Infernal Machine's great size makes it largely immobile.

Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the Infernal Machine to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space and time, rendering it inoperable until those components are found again.": "疯子卢姆的无间道机器可以自我修复任何不属于灾难性的损害，在卢姆的时代，它是如何被禁用的仍然是个谜。据传闻，如果设置了一个特定的控制组合，无间道机器就会进入修复模式，允许不受限制地进入其内部工作，并在受到攻击时防止其自我恢复。另外，其他的控制组合可能会导致无间道机器将其最关键的部件传送到时空深处的某个地方，使其无法运作，直到这些部件被再次找到。",

	"When the Accounting and Valuation of All Things is used as a spellbook, it maintains a unique ability to forcibly acquire souls. Any creature killed by a spell transcribed within the book has their soul ripped from their body and sent to Minauros.

	"The second route, in case Mammon is unavailable or unwilling, is to incinerate the book. To accomplish this task, a pot of platinum (valued at no less than 99,999 gp) must be melted, enough to fully submerge the book. Once the platinum is prepared, dropping the tome into the molten solution melts the tome. The process completely destroys the tome, as well as the platinum.": "第二条路线，在魔王(Mammon)不可用或不愿意的情况下，是焚烧这本书。为了完成这个任务，必须熔化一锅铂金(价值不低于99,999 gp)，足以完全浸没这本书。一旦铂金准备好，将书投入熔化的溶液中，书就会被熔化。这个过程完全摧毁了这本书，以及铂金。",
