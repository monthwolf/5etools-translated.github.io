The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.": "用一个金币，一个角色可以买一个腰包，50英尺的好绳子，或者一只山羊。一个熟练的（但不是特殊的）工匠每天可以赚取一块金币。金币是衡量财富的标准单位，即使钱币本身并不常用。当商人讨论涉及价值数百或数千金币的商品或服务的交易时，交易通常不涉及单个金币的交换。相反，金币是一种标准的价值衡量标准，实际的交换是以金条、信用证或有价值的货物进行的。",

	"Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao -potentially for the final time.": "很久以前，宁静的拉奥神创造了一个工具，以保护他的新生信徒免受下层世界的邪恶之害。然而，随着岁月的流逝，凡人开发了他们自己的方法来处理存在的威胁，这把钩子基本上被遗忘了。不过，在最近的年代里，拉奥的钩子被重新发现，并被用来对付巫婆女王伊格威夫（巫师塔莎的名字之一）的崛起。虽然她被打败了，但伊格威夫在战斗中设法损坏了羊角，使其感染了一个阴险的诅咒--以及未来胜利的可能性。事后，这把钩子再次丢失。偶尔它也会重新出现，但这个著名的神器已经不是原来的样子了。无论神器的持有者是否意识到它的全部威胁，很少有人冒险使用拉奥古克--可能是最后一次。",

	"The Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad is self-repairing of anything short of catastrophic damage, and how it was disabled in Lum's time remains a mystery. It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the Infernal Machine will enter a repair mode, allowing unfettered access to its inner workings—and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked. Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the Infernal Machine to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space and time, rendering it inoperable until those components are found again.": "疯子卢姆的无间道机器可以自我修复任何不属于灾难性的损害，在卢姆的时代，它是如何被禁用的仍然是个谜。据传闻，如果设置了一个特定的控制组合，无间道机器就会进入修复模式，允许不受限制地进入其内部工作，并在受到攻击时防止其自我恢复。另外，其他的控制组合可能会导致无间道机器将其最关键的部件传送到时空深处的某个地方，使其无法运作，直到这些部件被再次找到。",

	"When the Accounting and Valuation of All Things is used as a spellbook, it maintains a unique ability to forcibly acquire souls.

	"The second route, in case Mammon is unavailable or unwilling, is to incinerate the book. To accomplish this task, a pot of platinum (valued at no less than 99,999 gp) must be melted, enough to fully submerge the book.
