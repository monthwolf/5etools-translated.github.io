As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends.

	"You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see.

You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.": "你也可以使用这个法术来探测你看不见的有思维的生物。当你施放这个法术或在持续时间内作为你的动作时，你可以搜索30英尺范围内的思维。这个法术可以穿透障碍物，但是2英尺厚的岩石、2英寸厚的除铅外的任何金属，或者一张薄的铅板会阻挡你。你无法探测到智力为3或更低，或者不会说任何语言的生物。",

	"You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it.

Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.": "在法术结束或你使用动作解除法术之前，你可以让自己——包括衣物、盔甲、武器和身上的其他物品——看起来与真实不同。你可以看起来比实际矮或高1英尺，并且可以显得瘦、胖或介于两者之间。你不能改变自己的体型，所以你必须采取与四肢基本排列相同的形态。否则，幻象的程度由你决定。",
	"The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.": "这个法术所带来的变化在物理检查中无法持续。例如，如果你用这个法术给你的服装添加一顶帽子，物体会穿过帽子，任何触碰它的人都感觉不到任何东西，或者会感觉到你的头和头发。如果你用这个法术让自己看起来比实际更瘦，那么伸手触摸你的人的手会碰到你，尽管在他们看来手似乎还在半空中。",

	"This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.": "这个法术会自动将一个大型或更小的非魔法物体或魔法力量创造物分解。如果目标是一个巨大或更大的物体或力量创造物，这个法术会将其分解成一个10英尺立方体的部分。魔法物品不受这个法术的影响。",

The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.": "笼子里的生物不能通过非魔法手段离开。如果生物试图使用传送或者跨位面旅行来离开笼子，它必须首先进行一次魅力豁免检定。若成功，生物可以使用那个魔法来离开笼子。若失败，生物无法离开笼子并浪费了那个法术或效果的使用。笼子也延伸到了以太界，阻止以太旅行。",

	"You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph.

	"You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature.

If the spell requires {@status concentration}, it lasts until the end of its full duration.": "你可以在施放时将一个3级或更低级的准备好的法术存储在符文中。这个法术必须以单个生物或区域为目标。以这种方式施放的存储法术没有立即效果。当触发符文时，存储的法术会被施放。如果法术有目标，它将以触发符文的生物为目标。如果法术影响一个区域，该区域将以该生物为中心。如果法术召唤敌对生物或制造有害物体或陷阱，它们会尽可能靠近入侵者并攻击它。如果法术需要{@status concentration}，它将持续直到完整持续时间结束。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by {@scaledamage 5d8|3-9|1d8} for each slot level above 3rd.

Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.": "你必须与目标交谈，描述其记忆是如何受影响的，目标必须能够理解你所说的语言，才能让修改后的记忆扎根。目标的大脑会填补你描述中的任何细节空白。如果在你完成描述修改记忆之前法术结束，目标的记忆不会被改变。否则，当法术结束时，修改后的记忆会生效。",
	"A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.": "一段修改过的记忆不一定会影响生物的行为，特别是如果这段记忆与生物的天性、阵营或信念相矛盾。一个不合逻辑的修改过的记忆，比如植入一段生物享受用酸液浇灌自己的记忆，可能会被忽略，就像是一场噩梦。DM可能会认为一个修改过的记忆太过荒谬，无法对生物产生重大影响。",

Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.": "当你使用5级或更高级别的法术位施放此法术时，你可以使立方体的尺寸每超过4级增加100英尺。因此，通过使用5级法术位，你可以保护一个边长最多达200英尺的立方体。",
	"You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.": "你创造了一个悬浮在范围内的力场剑形飞行器。它持续到持续时间结束。",
	"When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 3d10} force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.": "当剑出现时，你可以对剑附近5英尺内的目标进行一次近战法术攻击。命中则目标受到{@damage 3d10}的力量伤害。在法术持续期间，你可以在每个回合使用一个奖励动作，将剑移动最多20英尺到一个你能看到的地方，并对同一目标或不同目标重复这次攻击。",
	"Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.": "选择一个不超过40英尺边长的地形区域。在施法距离内，你可以随意改变该区域内的泥土、沙土或黏土。在施法持续时间内，你可以提高或降低该区域的海拔，挖掘或填平沟壑，竖立或拉平墙壁，或者形成支柱。任何这些改变的范围都不能超过该区域最大尺寸的一半。因此，如果你影响一个40英尺的正方形，你可以创建一个高达20英尺的支柱，将正方形的海拔提高或降低最多20英尺，挖掘最多20英尺深的沟壑，等等。这些改变需要10分钟时间完成。",
	"At the end of every 10 minutes you spend {@status concentration||concentrating} on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.": "在你施放{@status concentration||concentrating}这个法术的每10分钟结束时，你可以选择一个新的地形区域来影响。",
	"Because the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.": "由于地形的变化发生缓慢，区域内的生物通常不会被地面的移动所困住或受伤。",
	"This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.": "这个法术不能操纵天然石材或石结构。岩石和建筑物会移动以适应新的地形。如果你塑造地形的方式会使建筑物不稳定，它可能会倒塌。",
	"Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.": "同样地，这个法术并不直接影响植物生长。移动的土地会带走其中的任何植物。",
	"For the duration, you hide a target that you touch from divination magic. The target can be a willing creature or a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can't be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.": "在持续时间内，你可以触摸并隐藏一个目标，使其免受占卜魔法的影响。目标可以是一个愿意的生物，一个地方或一个任何维度不超过10英尺的物体。目标无法被任何占卜魔法所瞄准，也无法通过魔法侦查传感器感知到。",

If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.": "当你施放这个法术时，请选择以下一个或两个效果。效果持续整个持续时间。如果你在连续30天每天都对同一生物或物体施放这个法术，每次都施加相同的效果，那么幻象会持续直到被驱散。",
	"You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as {@spell detect magic}, that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object's magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.": "你可以改变目标在检测魔法光环的法术和魔法效果中出现的方式，比如{@spell detect magic}。你可以让一个非魔法物品看起来像是有魔法的，一个有魔法的物品看起来像是没有魔法的，或者改变物品的魔法光环，让它看起来属于你选择的特定魔法学派。当你在一个物品上使用这个效果时，你可以让虚假的魔法对任何处理该物品的生物显现出来。",
	"You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin's {@classFeature Divine Sense|Paladin|PHB|1} or the trigger of a {@spell symbol} spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.": "你改变目标在检测生物类型的法术和魔法效果中出现的方式，比如圣骑士的{@classFeature Divine Sense|Paladin|PHB|1}或{@spell symbol}法术的触发。你选择一个生物类型，其他法术和魔法效果会将目标视为该类型的生物或该阵营的生物。",
	"A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 10d6} cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.": "一团寒冷能量从你的指尖飞出，飞向范围内你选择的一个点，在那里爆炸形成一个半径60英尺的球体。范围内的每个生物必须进行一次体质豁免投骰。未通过豁免的生物会受到{@damage 10d6}点冷伤害。通过豁免的生物则只会受到一半伤害。",
	"If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.": "如果地球撞击到水体或者主要是水的液体（不包括水生生物），它会使液体结冰，冰层深度为30平方英尺的区域上方6英寸。这层冰持续1分钟。在结冰水面游泳的生物会被困在冰中。被困的生物可以使用一个动作，对抗你的法术豁免 DC 进行一次力量检定来挣脱。",
	"You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already shattered, it explodes.": "在完成施法后，您可以选择不投掷这个（Globe of Invulnerability）魔法球。一个冰凉触感的小球出现在您的手中，大小与投石器石头相仿。您或者您交给的生物随时可以投掷这个球（射程40英尺）或者用投石器投掷（投石器的正常射程）。球在撞击时会破碎，效果与正常施法相同。您也可以将球放置在地面上而不使其破碎。1分钟后，如果球还没有破碎，它会爆炸。",

	"Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.": "没有任何东西——无论是物理物体、能量还是其他法术效果——可以穿过这个屏障，无法进入或离开，尽管球体内的生物可以在那里呼吸。这个球体对所有伤害免疫，球体内的生物或物体不会受到来自外部的攻击或效果的伤害，球体内的生物也无法伤害到外部的任何东西。",
	"The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.": "这个球体没有重量，刚好足够容纳里面的生物或物体。被封闭在内的生物可以使用动作来推动球体的墙壁，从而将球体滚动到生物速度的一半。同样，其他生物也可以捡起并移动这个球体。",

Creatures that can't be {@condition charmed} are immune to this spell.": "选择范围内可见的一个生物。目标开始在原地进行一场滑稽的舞蹈：拖着脚步、踢踏脚步，并且翩翩起舞直到持续时间结束。无法被 {@condition charmed} 的生物对此法术免疫。",
	"A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the spell ends.": "一只跳舞生物必须利用所有移动力在原地跳舞，对敏捷豁免和攻击骰有劣势。当目标受此法术影响时，其他生物对其的攻击骰获得优势。作为一个动作，跳舞生物进行一次感知豁免骰来恢复自控。若成功豁免，则法术结束。",
	"A passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration.

The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.": "在你选择的一个位置上，你可以看到一个出现在射程内的木头、灰泥或石头表面（如墙壁、天花板或地板）上的通道，持续一段时间。你可以选择开口的尺寸：最多5英尺宽，8英尺高，20英尺深。这个通道不会对周围的结构造成不稳定。",
	"When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.": "当开口消失时，由法术创造的通道中仍有生物或物体的话，它们会被安全地弹出到你施放法术的表面附近最近的空间。",
	"You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.": "你制造了一个幻象，植入在你能看到范围内的生物的头脑中。目标必须进行一次智力豁免投。在豁免失败时，你创造一个幻觉物体、生物或其他可见现象，大小不超过一个10英尺的立方体，只有目标能在持续时间内感知到。这个法术对亡灵或构造物没有影响。",
	"The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.": "幻影包括声音、温度和其他刺激，也只对该生物可见。",
	"The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.": "目标可以使用动作对幻影进行智力检定（{@skill Investigation}）与你的法术豁免 DC 相比。如果检定成功，目标意识到幻影是一个幻觉，法术结束。",
	"While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.": "当目标受到这个法术影响时，目标会把幻象当作真实的对待。目标会为与幻象互动产生的任何不合逻辑的结果进行合理化解释。例如，一个试图走过横跨深渊的幻象桥的目标一旦踏上桥就会摔倒。如果目标幸存下来，它仍然相信桥是存在的，并为自己的摔倒想出其他解释——比如被推了、滑倒了，或者是被强风刮倒了。",
	"An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal {@damage 1d6} psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.": "受影响的目标如此深信幻象的真实性，以至于它甚至可以从幻象中受到伤害。一个被创造成看起来像生物的幻象可以攻击目标。同样，一个被创造成看起来像火、一汪酸或熔岩的幻象可以灼伤目标。每个回合在你的轮次上，如果目标在幻象的区域内或在幻象的5英尺范围内，且幻象是一个合乎逻辑可能造成伤害的生物或危险物的话，幻象可以对目标造成{@damage 1d6}点精神伤害。目标会感知这个伤害的类型与幻象相符。",
	"You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes {@condition frightened} for the duration. At the end of each of the target's turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take {@damage 4d10} psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.": "你侵入了你能看到范围内生物的噩梦，并创造了一个幻觉，展现出它最深的恐惧，只有该生物能看到。目标必须进行一次感知豁免投骰。如果未通过豁免，目标在持续时间内变为{@condition frightened}。在法术结束前，目标的每个回合结束时，必须进行一次感知豁免投骰，否则受到{@damage 4d10}点心灵伤害。若通过豁免，法术结束。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 4d10|4-9|1d10} for each slot level above 4th.": "当你使用5级或更高级别的法术位施放这个法术时，伤害会每超过4级的位数增加{@scaledamage 4d10|4-9|1d10}。",
	"A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.": "一个巨大的准实际的、类似马的生物出现在你选择范围内的一个未被占据的空间中。你决定这个生物的外观，但它会配备鞍、嚼子和笼头。如果这个法术创造的任何装备离开坐骑超过10英尺，它们会在一团烟雾中消失。",
	"For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a {@creature riding horse}, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.": "在持续时间内，你或你选择的生物可以骑乘这匹坐骑。该生物使用{@creature riding horse}的统计数据，但速度为100英尺，并且可以以每小时10英里的速度行进，或者以快速速度行进13英里。法术结束时，坐骑会逐渐消失，骑手有1分钟的时间下马。如果你使用一个动作解除法术，或者坐骑受到任何伤害，法术也会结束。",
	"You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a {@filter celestial|bestiary|type=celestial|miscellaneous=!swarm}, an {@filter elemental|bestiary|type=elemental|miscellaneous=!swarm}, or a {@filter fiend|bestiary|type=fiend|miscellaneous=!swarm} loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).": "你请求一位超自然实体的帮助。这个实体必须为你所知：一个神、一个原初生物、一个恶魔王子，或者其他一些拥有宇宙力量的存在。那个实体会派遣一个{@filter celestial|bestiary|type=celestial|miscellaneous=!swarm}，一个{@filter elemental|bestiary|type=elemental|miscellaneous=!swarm}，或者一个{@filter fiend|bestiary|type=fiend|miscellaneous=!swarm} 来帮助你，让这个生物出现在你附近的一个未被占据的空间内。如果你知道某个特定生物的名字，你可以在施放这个法术时说出那个名字来请求那个生物，尽管你可能会得到一个不同的生物（由主持人选择）。",
	"When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.": "当生物出现时，并不受任何特定行为的强制。你可以要求生物提供服务以换取报酬，但它并不一定要这样做。所要求的任务可能从简单的（带我们飞过峡谷，或帮助我们参加战斗）到复杂的（监视我们的敌人，或在我们进入地牢时保护我们）。你必须能够与生物沟通以讨价还价获取其服务。",
	"Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.": "支付可以采用各种形式。 一个天界生物可能需要向一个盟友的神庙捐赠大量的黄金或魔法物品，而一个邪恶生物可能要求活生生的祭品或财宝作为礼物。 一些生物可能会用他们的服务来换取你承担的任务。",
	"As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.": "按照惯例，一个可以用分钟来衡量的任务需要支付每分钟100 gp。一个以小时计算的任务需要每小时1,000 gp。而一个以天为单位（最多10天）的任务需要每天10,000 gp。DM可以根据你施放法术的情况调整这些支付金额。如果任务符合生物的道德准则，支付金额可能会减半甚至免除。无危险的任务通常只需要建议支付金额的一半，而特别危险的任务可能需要更大的报酬。生物很少接受看起来自杀性的任务。",
	"After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.": "在生物完成任务后，或者约定的服务期限到期时，生物会在向您汇报后返回其本源位面，如果任务需要并且可能的话。如果您无法就生物的服务达成价格协议，生物会立即返回其本源位面。",

The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted {@spell magic circle} in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.)

It doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren't removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.": "这个法术在生物死亡时中和任何毒素并治愈正常疾病。然而，它无法去除魔法疾病、诅咒等；如果在施法前未去除这类效果，它们会在生物复活后影响目标。",
	"This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.": "这个法术可以治愈所有致命伤，并恢复任何缺失的身体部位。",
	"Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can't cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.": "施放这个法术来让一名已经死亡一年或更久的生物复活会极大地消耗你的力量。直到你完成一次长休，你将无法再施放法术，并且在所有攻击检定、能力检定和豁免检定中都会受到劣势。",
	"This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.": "这个法术在范围内以一个点为中心，形成半径50英尺、高100英尺的圆柱体，使重力反转。在该区域内，所有未与地面固定的生物和物体都会向上坠落，并在你施放该法术时到达区域顶部。生物可以进行敏捷豁免才能抓住可以触及的固定物体，从而避免坠落。",
	"If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.": "如果在下落过程中遇到了一些固体物体（比如天花板），下落的物体和生物会像在正常向下下落时一样撞击它。如果一个物体或生物到达区域顶部而没有撞击任何东西，它会在那里停留，略微摆动，直到持续时间结束。",
	"At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.": "在持续时间结束时，受影响的物体和生物会掉落回来。",
	"You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.": "你触摸了在过去一分钟内死亡的生物。那个生物以1点生命值复活。这个法术不能让因老年死亡的生物复活，也不能恢复任何缺失的身体部分。",
	"You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.": "你触摸了一根长达60英尺的绳子。绳子的一端随后升入空中，直到整根绳子垂直于地面。在绳子的上端，一个无形的入口打开，通往一个超维空间，持续到咒语结束。",
	"The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space.": "可以通过爬到绳子顶端来进入超维空间。这个空间可以容纳多达八个中型或更小的生物。绳子可以被拉进空间，使得在空间外看不到绳子。",
	"Attacks and spells can't cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope.": "攻击和法术无法穿过进入或离开超维空间的入口，但里面的人可以像通过一个以绳索为中心的3英尺×5英尺窗户一样看到外面。",
	"Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.": "当法术结束时，超维空间内的任何物品都会掉出来。",
	"Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 1d8} radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.": "一道火焰般的光辉降临在你能看到的范围内的生物身上。目标必须成功进行一次敏捷豁免才能避免受到{@damage 1d8}辐射伤害。目标在这次豁免中不得受到掩护的益处。",
	"You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a {@spell fireball}.": "你在范围内保护一个生物免受攻击。直到法术结束，任何以攻击或有害法术瞄准被保护生物的生物必须首先进行一次感知豁免检定。未通过检定的生物必须选择一个新目标，否则失去攻击或法术。这个法术不能保护被保护生物免受区域效果的影响，比如{@spell fireball}的爆炸。",
	"If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.": "如果被施加此法术的生物进行攻击，施放对敌人产生影响的法术，或对另一个生物造成伤害，该法术将会结束。",
	"You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.": "你创造了三道火焰射线，将它们投向射程内的目标。你可以将它们投向一个目标或多个目标。",
	"Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 2d6} fire damage.": "为每一道光线进行远程法术攻击。命中目标时，目标受到{@damage 2d6}火焰伤害。",

	"You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you're casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.": "你可以看到和听到你选择的一个生物，只要它和你在同一个存在平面上。目标必须进行一次感知豁免投掷，这个投掷受你对目标的了解程度和你与目标的身体联系方式的影响。如果目标知道你正在施放这个法术，它可以自愿放弃豁免投掷，如果它想被观察的话。",

	"On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see {@condition invisible} objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.": "在未通过豁免检定时，法术会在目标身边10英尺内创建一个隐形传感器。你可以通过传感器看到和听到，就好像你在那里一样。传感器会随着目标移动，在持续时间内保持在目标的10英尺范围内。一个能看见{@condition invisible}物体的生物会将传感器视为一个大约拳头大小的发光球体。",
	"Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.": "你可以选择一个你之前见过的地点作为这个法术的目标，而不是瞄准一个生物。当你这样做时，感应器会出现在那个位置，并且不会移动。",
	"The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the spell's duration, your weapon flares with white-hot intensity, and the attack deals an extra {@damage 1d6} fire damage to the target and causes the target to ignite in flames. At the start of each of its turns until the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes {@damage 1d6} fire damage. On a successful save, the spell ends. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such as the target being submerged in water), the spell ends.": "在法术持续期间，下次你用近战武器攻击命中生物时，你的武器会闪耀出白热的光芒，攻击额外造成{@damage 1d6}火焰伤害，并使目标燃烧起火焰。在法术持续期间，目标在每个回合开始时必须进行一次体质豁免检定。未通过检定则受到{@damage 1d6}火焰伤害。通过检定则法术结束。如果目标或目标周围5英尺范围内的生物使用一个动作扑灭火焰，或者其他效果熄灭了火焰（比如目标被水浸泡），法术也会结束。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial extra damage dealt by the attack increases by {@scaledamage 1d6|1-9|1d6} for each slot level above 1st.": "当你使用2级或更高级别的法术位施放这个法术时，攻击造成的初始额外伤害每超过1级的位等级增加{@scaledamage 1d6|1-9|1d6}。",
	"For the duration, you see {@condition invisible} creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.": "在这段时间里，你可以看到{@condition invisible}生物和物体，就好像它们是可见的，而且你可以看到虚空位面。虚空生物和物体看起来幽灵般透明。",
	"This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.": "这个法术允许你改变你能看到范围内的任意数量生物的外观。你可以为每个选择的目标赋予一个新的虚幻外表。一个不愿意的目标可以进行一次魅力豁免，如果成功，它不受这个法术的影响。",
	"The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.": "这个法术可以伪装外貌，包括衣服、盔甲、武器和装备。你可以让每个生物看起来比原来矮或高1英尺，并且看起来瘦、胖或介于两者之间。你不能改变目标的体型，所以你必须选择一个有着相同基本肢体结构的形态。否则，幻象的程度由你决定。法术持续一段时间，除非你用动作提前解除它。",
	"The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.": "这个法术所带来的变化在物理检查中无法持续。例如，如果你用这个法术给生物的服装添加一顶帽子，物体会穿过帽子，任何触碰它的人都会感觉不到任何东西，或者会感觉到生物的头部和头发。如果你用这个法术让自己看起来比实际更瘦，那么伸手触碰你的人的手会碰到你，尽管在他看来手似乎还在半空中。",
	"A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.": "生物可以使用其动作来检查一个目标，并进行一次智力检定（{@skill Investigation}）与你的法术豁免 DC 进行对抗。如果成功，它会意识到目标被伪装了。",
	"You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.": "你向一只你熟悉的生物发送少于25个字的简短消息。这只生物会在脑海中听到这条消息，如果它认识你，会认出你是发件人，并能立即以同样的方式回答。这个法术使至少有1点智力的生物能理解你消息的意思。",
	"You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a {@chance 5|||Message lost!|Message arrives} chance that the message doesn't arrive.": "你可以将消息传递到任何距离，甚至到其他存在平面，但如果目标在与你不同的平面上，有{@chance 5|||Message lost!|Message arrives}的机会消息无法到达。",
	"By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes {@condition invisible} and can't be targeted by {@filter divination spells|spells|school=D} or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.": "通过这个咒语，一个愿意的生物或物体可以在一段时间内被隐藏起来，免受探测。当你施放这个咒语并触摸目标时，它变得{@condition invisible}，无法被{@filter divination spells|spells|school=D}瞄准，也无法通过占卜咒语创建的侦查传感器感知到。",
	"If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn't grow older.": "如果目标是一个生物，它将陷入悬停状态。时间对它来说停止流动，它也不会变老。",
	"You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include \"after 1,000 years\" or \"when the {@creature tarrasque} awakens.\" This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.": "你可以设定一个条件来提前结束这个法术。条件可以是你选择的任何事物，但必须发生或可见于目标1英里范围内。例如，“经过1000年”或“当{@creature tarrasque}苏醒时”。如果目标受到任何伤害，这个法术也会结束。",
	"You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can't be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.": "你可以在一段时间内变成另一个生物的形态。新形态可以是任何具有与你等级相等或更低挑战等级的生物。这个生物不能是构造物或不死生物，而且你必须至少见过这种生物。你会变成那种生物的普通例子，没有任何职业级别或施法特性。",
	"Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus in place of yours. You can't use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.": "你的游戏统计数据被选择生物的统计数据所取代，但你保留你的阵营以及智力(Intelligence)、感知(Wisdom)和魅力(Charisma)分数。你还保留所有的技能和豁免加值，同时获得该生物的技能和豁免加值。如果该生物与你具有相同的熟练加值，且其统计数据中列出的加值高于你的，则使用该生物的加值代替你的。你不能使用新形态的任何传奇动作或巢穴动作。",
	"You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can't use any special senses you have (for example, {@sense darkvision}) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.": "你保留你的职业、种族或其他来源的任何特性，并可以使用它们，前提是你的新形态在物理上能够这样做。除非你的新形态也具有该感官，否则你不能使用你拥有的任何特殊感官（例如，{@sense darkvision}）。只有当生物通常能够说话时，你才能说话。",
	"When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.": "当你变形时，你可以选择你的装备是掉落到地面上，融入新形态中，还是被新形态穿戴。穿戴的装备功能正常。根据生物的形状和大小，DM决定新形态是否能够实际穿戴一件装备。你的装备不会改变形状或大小以适应新形态，并且新形态无法穿戴的任何装备必须要么掉落到地面上，要么融入你的新形态中。融入的装备在那种状态下没有任何效果。",

	"A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw.

A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.": "在你选择的范围内的某一点突然发出一阵刺耳的巨响。以那一点为中心的10英尺半径球体范围内的每个生物必须进行一次体质豁免投。一个生物在未通过豁免投的情况下受到{@damage 3d8} 雷属性伤害，通过豁免投的生物受到一半伤害。像石头、水晶或金属等无机材料构成的生物在这次豁免投中有劣势。",
	"A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.": "如果一个非魔法物品没有被穿戴或携带，并且它在法术的范围内，它也会受到伤害。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d8|2-9|1d8} for each slot level above 2nd.": "当你使用3级或更高级别的法术位施放这个法术时，伤害将每个高于2级的法术位等级增加{@scaledamage 3d8|2-9|1d8}。",

The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn't already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.": "你手中的{@item club|phb}或{@item quarterstaff|phb}木材蕴含着大自然的力量。在持续时间内，你可以使用你的施法能力代替力量进行使用该武器的近战攻击和伤害骰投掷，武器的伤害骰变为{@dice d8}。如果武器尚未是魔法武器，它也会变成魔法武器。如果你再次施放该法术或放开武器，法术就会结束。",
	"Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target.

	"You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.": "你可以使用你的动作让影像移动到范围内的任何位置。随着影像改变位置，你可以改变它的外观，使其移动看起来对于影像来说是自然的。例如，如果你创建了一个生物的影像并移动它，你可以改变影像，使其看起来像在行走。",
	"Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

	"The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat.

	"You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the DM's discretion.": "在一段时间内，你获得了理解和与野兽口头交流的能力。许多野兽的知识和意识受到它们的智力限制，但至少，野兽可以向你提供关于附近地点和怪物的信息，包括它们能够感知到或在过去一天内感知到的任何事物。在DM的裁量下，你可能能说服一只野兽为你做一点小事情。",

Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can't speculate about future events.": "直到法术结束，你可以向尸体提出最多五个问题。尸体只知道它在生前知道的事情，包括它懂得的语言。答案通常简短、神秘或重复，如果你对它敌对或它认出你是敌人，尸体没有义务提供真实的答案。这个法术并不会将生物的灵魂送回它的身体，只是它的激发灵魂。因此，尸体无法获得新信息，不理解它死后发生的任何事情，也无法推测未来事件。",
	"You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell's area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.": "你赋予你周围30英尺范围内的植物有限的感知和活力，使它们能够与你沟通并遵循你简单的命令。你可以询问植物关于法术范围内过去一天发生的事件，获取有关经过的生物、天气和其他情况的信息。",

If you are evil, they appear fiendish.": "你召唤出灵魂来保护你。它们在你周围飘动，距离为15英尺，持续时间内。如果你是善良或中立阵营，它们的幽灵形态看起来像天使或精灵(你选择)。如果你是邪恶的，它们看起来像恶魔。",

When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to {@damage 1d8} + your spellcasting ability modifier.": "你在范围内创造一个漂浮的幽灵武器，持续时间为法术持续时间，或直到你再次施放此法术。当你施放这个法术时，你可以对距离武器5英尺内的生物进行近战法术攻击。命中时，目标受到等于{@damage 1d8} + 你的法术属性调整值的力量伤害。",

	"You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range.

If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.": "你和你的小组（或目标对象）最终会出现在一个与目标区域在视觉或主题上相似的不同区域。例如，如果你正前往你的家庭实验室，你可能会出现在另一个巫师的实验室里，或者在一个炼金补给店里，那里有许多与你实验室相同的工具和器具。通常，你会出现在最接近的相似地点，但由于这个法术没有范围限制，你理论上可能会出现在平面上的任何地方。",

You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.": "许多主要的寺庙、行会和其他重要场所内都刻有永久传送阵。每个传送阵都包括一个独特的符文序列——一串以特定模式排列的魔法符文。当你第一次获得施放这个法术的能力时，你会学会两个位于物质位面上的目的地的符文序列，由DM决定。你可以在冒险中学习额外的符文序列。在研究一分钟后，你可以将新的符文序列记在脑中。",

	"The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can't move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.": "当你离它不超过20英尺时，这个圆盘是静止的。如果你离它超过20英尺，圆盘会跟随你，以确保它始终在你的20英尺范围内。它可以穿过不平整的地形，上下楼梯，斜坡之类的地形，但不能跨越10英尺或更高的高差。例如，这个圆盘无法穿过一个10英尺深的坑，如果坑是在底部创建的，它也无法离开这样的坑。",
	"If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.": "如果你离开光盘超过100英尺（通常是因为它无法绕过障碍物跟随你），那么法术就会结束。",

You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.": "你可以在射程内的坚实表面上创建一堵冰墙。你可以将其塑造成一个半球形圆顶或半径长达10英尺的球体，或者你可以塑造成由十个10英尺正方形面板组成的平面表面。每个面板必须与另一个面板相邻。无论是哪种形式，这堵墙都有1英尺厚，并持续一段时间。",
	"If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes {@damage 10d6} cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.": "如果墙壁出现时穿过生物的空间，那么在其区域内的生物将被推到墙壁的一侧，并必须进行一次敏捷豁免检定。如果豁免失败，生物将受到{@damage 10d6}的冰冷伤害，如果豁免成功，则伤害减半。",
	"The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes {@damage 5d6} cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "这堵墙是一个可以被破坏并因此被突破的物体。它的AC为12，每个10英尺的部分有30点生命值，并且对火焰伤害易受伤。将一段10英尺的墙降低到0点生命值会摧毁它，并在墙所占据的空间留下一片寒冷空气。第一次在回合中穿过这片寒冷空气的生物必须进行一次体质豁免检定。该生物在豁免失败时受到{@damage 5d6}的冷伤害，豁免成功时受到一半伤害。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by {@scaledamage 10d6|6-9|2d6}, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by {@scaledamage 5d6|6-9|1d6}, for each slot level above 6th.": "当你使用7级或更高级别的法术位施放此法术时，墙壁出现时造成的伤害增加了{@scaledamage 10d6|6-9|2d6}，穿过寒冷空气屏障时受到的伤害增加了{@scaledamage 5d6|6-9|1d6}，每超过6级的法术位级别增加一次。",
	"A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.": "在你选择的范围内，一堵非魔法的坚固石墙突然出现。这堵墙厚6英寸，由十个10英尺乘10英尺的面板组成。每个面板必须与至少一个其他面板相邻。或者，你可以创建10英尺乘20英尺的面板，厚度只有3英寸。",
	"If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.": "如果墙壁出现时穿过生物的空间，生物会被推到墙壁的一侧（由你选择）。如果一个生物被墙壁（或墙壁和另一坚固表面）包围在四面，那个生物可以进行一次敏捷豁免检定。若成功，它可以使用其反应移动其速度，以便不再被墙壁围住。",
	"The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.": "这堵墙可以是任何你想要的形状，但不能占据与生物或物体相同的空间。这堵墙不需要垂直，也不需要依靠坚固的基础。然而，它必须与现有的石头融合并得到坚实支撑。因此，你可以利用这个法术来横跨深渊或创建一个坡道。",
	"If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.": "如果你创建了长度超过20英尺的跨度，你必须将每个面板的尺寸减半以创建支撑。你可以粗略地塑造墙壁，以创建垛口、城垛等等。",
	"The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.": "这堵墙是由石头制成的物体，可以被破坏，从而被突破。每个面板的护甲等级为15，每英寸厚度有30点生命值。将一个面板的生命值降至0会摧毁它，并可能导致连接的面板在DM酌情下倒塌。",
	"If you maintain your {@status concentration} on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.": "如果你在整个法术持续时间内保持你的{@status concentration}，那么这道墙将变成永久的，无法被驱散。否则，当法术结束时，墙会消失。",
	"You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.": "你创造了一堵坚固、柔韧、长满针尖般锋利刺的灌木墙。这堵墙出现在射程内的坚固表面上，并持续一段时间。你可以选择让这堵墙长达60英尺，高10英尺，厚5英尺；或者是一个直径20英尺，高达20英尺，厚5英尺的圆形。这堵墙会阻挡视线。",

	"A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes {@damage 7d8} slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "生物可以穿过墙壁，尽管缓慢而痛苦。每移动1英尺穿过墙壁，必须花费4英尺的移动力。此外，每当一个生物在一个回合内进入墙壁或在那里结束回合时，该生物必须进行一次敏捷豁免检定。在未通过豁免检定时，受到{@damage 7d8} 钝击伤害，通过时则受到一半伤害。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by {@scaledamage 7d8|6-9|1d8} for each slot level above 6th.": "当你使用7级或更高级别的法术位施放这个法术时，每超过6级的位级，两种伤害都增加{@scaledamage 7d8|6-9|1d8}。",
	"This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.": "这个法术保护一个你触摸的愿意的生物，并在法术结束前在你和目标之间建立一个神秘连接。当目标在你的60英尺范围内时，它的AC和豁免投掷获得+1的加值，并且对所有伤害具有抗性。此外，每当它受到伤害时，你也会受到同样数量的伤害。",
	"The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.": "如果你的生命值降到0点，或者你和目标相隔超过60英尺，那么这个法术就会结束。如果这个法术再次施放在这两个连接的生物中的任何一个身上，它也会结束。你也可以用一个动作来解除这个法术。",
	"This spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.": "这个法术可以让你看到范围内的最多十个愿意的生物在法术结束前拥有在水下呼吸的能力。受影响的生物也保留他们正常的呼吸方式。",
	"This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.": "这个法术赋予了移动在任何液体表面上的能力——比如水、酸、泥浆、雪、流沙或熔岩——就像它们是无害的坚实地面一样（穿越熔岩的生物仍然会受到热量的伤害）。你能看到范围内的最多十个愿意的生物在持续时间内获得这种能力。",

	"If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.": "如果蜘蛛网没有固定在两个坚固的物体（如墙壁或树木）之间，也没有铺设在地板、墙壁或天花板上，那么所施放的蜘蛛网会自行坍塌，法术会在你的下一个回合开始时结束。铺设在平面表面上的蜘蛛网深度为5英尺。",

	"Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes {@condition frightened} for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat.

While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the {@action Dash} action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is {@condition incapacitated} and can't move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.": "在施法距离内，你和最多十个愿意的生物可以进入气态形态，持续时间内看起来像一团云雾。在云雾形态下，生物的飞行速度为300英尺，并对来自非魔法武器的伤害具有抗性。生物在这种形态下只能进行{@action Dash}动作或恢复成正常形态。恢复需要1分钟，期间生物处于{@condition incapacitated}状态且不能移动。法术持续期间，生物可以恢复成云雾形态，同样需要1分钟的转变时间。",

	"You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result.

	"You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.": "你也许能够实现超出以上示例范围的愿望。请尽可能准确地向DM陈述你的愿望。在这种情况下，DM有很大的裁量权来决定发生什么事情；愿望越大，出现问题的可能性就越大。这个法术可能会简单地失败，你所期望的效果可能只能部分实现，或者由于你表达愿望的方式而遭受一些意想不到的后果。例如，希望一个恶棍死去可能会将你推向未来，到那时那个恶棍已经不再活着，从而有效地将你从游戏中移除。同样，希望得到一件传奇魔法物品或神器可能会立即将你传送到该物品当前所有者的面前。",
	"The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take {@damage 1d10} necrotic damage per level of that spell.
