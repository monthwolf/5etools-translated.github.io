	"When you cast this spell, you inscribe a detection glyph that later activates a magical effect at the site of a separate, linked glyph. You inscribe the detection glyph either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the detection glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.": "当你施展这个法术时，你刻下一个探测石刻，随后在一个单独的、相连的石刻处激活一个魔法效果。你可以将探测石刻刻在一个表面上（比如桌子或一段地板或墙壁），或者刻在一个可以关闭的物体内（比如一本书、一个卷轴或一个宝箱），以掩盖石刻。该石刻可以覆盖一个直径不超过10英尺的区域。如果该表面或物体从你施放此法术的地方移动超过10英尺，探测字形就会被破坏，并且该法术结束时不会被触发。",
	"You decide what triggers the detection glyph when you cast this spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.": "当你施展这个法术时，你决定什么会触发探测石刻。对于刻在表面上的石刻，最典型的触发因素包括触摸或站在石刻上，移除覆盖在石刻上的其他物体，接近石刻一定距离内，或操纵刻有石刻的物体。对于刻在物体上的字形，最常见的触发因素包括打开该物体，接近该物体一定距离内，或看到或阅读该字形。一旦一个石刻被触发，这个法术就会结束。",
	"You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.": "你可以进一步细化触发条件，使咒语只在特定情况下或根据身体特征（如身高或体重）、生物种类（例如，可以将守护设置为影响畸形人或乌鸦）或排列组合。你也可以为不触发石刻的生物设置条件，比如说那些说出某种口令的生物。",
	"When you inscribe the detection glyph, choose an alarm glyph or spell glyph to link to it.": "当你刻下探测字形时，选择一个警报字形或咒语字形与之相连。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher to create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use.": "当你使用五级或以上的法术槽施展此法术以创造一个法术字形时，你可以储存任何与你使用的法术槽相同等级的法术。",
	"Both glyphs are nearly invisible, and finding either requires a successful Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check against your spell save DC.": "这两个石刻都几乎不可见，要找到其中任何一个石刻都需要成功的智力（{@skill Investigation}）检查和法术救赎DC。",
	"You create and magically link two glyphs: a detection glyph and an effect glyph. Each of these two glyphs must stay within 100 miles of the other or the spell effect ends. When the detection glyph is triggered, the effect glyph reacts like an alarm spell, creating a mental ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the effect glyph. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.": "你创造并魔法地链接了两个符文：一个侦测符文和一个效果符文。这两个符文中的每一个必须距离另一个符文**100英里**以内，否则咒语效果会消失。当侦测符文被触发时，效果符文会像警报咒语一样反应，如果你距离效果符文**1英里以内**，你的大脑会产生一种心理反应。这种反应会在你睡觉时唤醒你。",
	"You create and magically link two glyphs: a detection glyph and an effect glyph. These two glyphs must be within 100 feet of each other. You can store a prepared spell of 4th level or lower in the effect glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyphs. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the detection glyph is triggered, the spell stored in the effect glyph is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on the effect glyph. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the effect glyph. If the spell requires {@status concentration}, it lasts until the end of its full duration.": "你创造并用魔法连接了两个符文：一个检测符文和一个效果符文。这两个符文必须相距不超过100英尺。你可以通过在创建符文的过程中施放一个准备好的4级或更低级法术来将它储存在效果符文中。被储存的法术必须以单个生物或区域为目标。这种方式施放的储存法术不会立即生效。当检测符文被触发时，效果符文中储存的法术将被施放。若法术有目标，则会以触发符文的生物为目标。若法术作用于区域，则区域以效果符文为中心。若法术召唤敌对生物、或创造有害物体或陷阱，则它们会尽可能靠近效果符文出现。若法术需要{@status concentration}，则持续到完整持续时间结束。"
