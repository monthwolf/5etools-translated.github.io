	"The double-bladed scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long, curving blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over centuries, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double-bladed scimitar is an expensive weapon (100 gp)—few though ever have the opportunity to purchase one. A Valenar blade in the hands of a non-elf is generally assumed to have been stolen or looted from a fallen foe, and a Valenar elf might feel entitled to demand its return or challenge the bearer to prove they're worthy to wield it.": "双刃弯刀是瓦勒纳精灵的标志性武器。细木的刀柄支撑着两端长长的、弯曲的刀片。经过几个世纪的技术磨练，这些刀刃坚固、锋利，而且非常轻。每把弯刀都是一个杰作，因此，双刃弯刀是一种昂贵的武器（100金币）--很少有人有机会购买。非精灵手中的瓦伦纳刀通常被认为是偷来的，或者是从倒下的敌人那里抢来的，瓦伦纳精灵可能会觉得有权要求归还它，或者挑战持有者以证明他们有资格挥舞它。"
