	"This shadowy horror was conjured by Tyreus. It is a powerful example of the terrifying evils that stalk the dark corners of Ravnica.

	"Morwena Veilmist was a Red Wizard of Thay, but she was never loyal. She saw the Thayan wizards as a means to acquire power. When she met Tyreus, she thought she saw a new opportunity.

The lesson she chose to learn was never to trust anyone.": "莫维娜-维米斯特是泰伊的红袍巫师，但她从不忠诚。她把泰伊的巫师视为获取权力的手段。当她遇到提瑞斯时，她认为自己看到了一个新的机会。她放弃了她的老学徒马利瓦，加入了泰勒斯。她希望自己在追求权力的过程中找到一个同行。她对自己的选择感到后悔，但仍然致力于自己的成功，而不是别人的。她选择吸取的教训是永远不要相信任何人。",
