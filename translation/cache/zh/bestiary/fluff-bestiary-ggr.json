	"The rank-and-file members of the Gruul Clans, called anarchs, despise civilization and have sworn to tear down both its physical structures and its institutions. Anarchs scavenge everything, from the hide armor they wear to the weapons they wield. As they pick through the refuse of the rubblebelts, they sometimes come across magic items and other valuable treasures.": "格鲁尔部族的普通成员被称为无政府主义者，他们鄙视文明，并发誓要拆毁其物质结构和制度。无政府主义者搜刮一切，从他们穿的皮甲到他们挥舞的武器。当他们在瓦砾带的垃圾中捡拾时，有时会遇到魔法物品和其他有价值的宝物。",
	"Archons are enigmatic, supernatural embodiments of the harshest aspects of law and order. They espouse a rigid sense of justice and deal ruthless punishment to those who break the law. This nature often aligns them with the Azorius Senate, and they are commonly seen circling above the Azorius guildhall astride their winged felidar mounts, soaring alongside griffon-mounted hussars.": "大主教是神秘的、超自然的法律和秩序的最严酷方面的化身。他们崇尚严格的正义感，对违法者进行无情的惩罚。这种性质常常使他们与阿索里乌斯元老院保持一致，人们经常看到他们骑着长着翅膀的Felidar坐骑在阿索里乌斯市政厅的上空盘旋，与骑着狮鹫的轻骑兵一起翱翔。",
	"An archon appears as an armored humanoid figure, nearly always mounted. Its face is usually shadowed beneath a large hood; those who have seen beneath the hood describe a face of celestial beauty with a stern expression and blank white eyes.": "弓箭手出现时是一个身穿铠甲的人形，几乎总是骑着马。它的脸通常被罩在一个大罩子下面；那些见过罩子下面的人描述了一张天人合一的脸，表情严厉，眼神空洞。",
	"The bond between an archon and its winged felidar mount is so close that the two are sometimes considered a single being, acting with a single mind. If an archon is ever thrown from its saddle, it can magically return to its place astride its mount in an instant.": "弓箭手和其带翅膀的飞利达坐骑之间的联系是如此紧密，以至于两者有时被认为是一个单一的生命，以一个单一的思想行事。如果大弓箭手被从马鞍上摔下来，它可以在瞬间神奇地回到它的坐骑上的位置。",
	"An archon doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.": "弓箭手不需要吃、喝、睡。",
	"An arclight phoenix is variously said to be a byproduct of a lightning strike on an aviary, a mishap in an effort to create a translocation device, or a successful attempt to create an elemental creature in the form of a majestic bird.": "凤凰有多种说法，有的说是鸟舍遭雷击的副产品，有的说是在努力创造移位装置时发生的意外，有的说是以雄伟的鸟的形式创造元素生物的成功尝试。",
	"Whatever its origin, an arclight phoenix looks like a bird of prey formed entirely of electrical energy. Lightning fans out behind it as it bolts from place to place through the sky, making up in speed what it lacks in grace and majesty. It seems happiest during natural thunderstorms, as it darts among the clouds, gliding alongside thunderbolts.": "不管它的起源是什么，光环凤凰看起来就像一只完全由电能形成的猛禽。当它在天空中从一个地方飞到另一个地方时，闪电在它身后展开，在速度上弥补了它在优雅和威严方面的不足。在自然界的雷暴中，它似乎是最快乐的，因为它在云层中飞奔，与雷电一起滑行。",
	"An arclight phoenix doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "箭牌凤凰不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"The angel Aurelia leads the Boros Legion. During the years of her leadership, she has shown a strong appreciation for the ordinary citizens who are often caught in the middle of interguild violence.": "天使奥蕾莉亚领导着博罗军团。在她领导的这些年里，她对那些经常陷入行会间暴力的普通公民表现出强烈的赞赏。",
	"True justice, Aurelia argues, isn't merely the enforcement of the letter of existing laws (let the Azorius fret over that), but the establishment of equitable and compassionate relationships among all of Ravnica's people. That means protecting the weak from the depredations of the strong, sheltering the innocents who are threatened by war, and ensuring that enforcement of the law doesn't become oppressive. Aurelia actively supports efforts to establish a lasting peace among the guilds in the absence of the Guildpact.": "奥蕾莉亚认为，真正的正义并不仅仅是执行现有法律的条文（让阿佐里乌斯为之烦恼吧），而是在拉夫尼卡的所有人民中建立起公平和富有同情心的关系。这意味着保护弱者免受强者的掠夺，庇护受到战争威胁的无辜者，并确保法律的执行不会变成压迫。奥瑞利亚积极支持在没有公会契约的情况下，在各公会之间建立持久的和平的努力。",
	"Aurelia prefers to lead the Boros Legion from the front. She brings swift and unrelenting punishment to the wicked, and her temper is legendary.": "奥瑞莉娅更喜欢从正面领导波罗斯军团。她给邪恶的人带来了迅速而无情的惩罚，她的脾气是传奇性的。",
	"Aurelia doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.": "奥瑞利亚不需要食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Battleforce angels are the radiant hosts that soar into combat, bathed in the light of Boros zeal. They lead companies of mortal soldiers from above or fly ahead of roc-mounted skyknights. They don't shy away from the blood, pain, and confusion of combat; rather, they immerse themselves in the shifting tides of battle. Only by wading into the battle can they fulfill their responsibility to carry out the commands of the warleaders by adapting their tactics to the shifting situation on the ground.": "战斗部队的天使是光芒四射的主人，他们在战斗中沐浴着波罗斯的热情之光。他们从高处带领凡人士兵，或飞在骑着大鹏的天空骑士的前面。他们不回避血腥、痛苦和混乱的战斗；相反，他们沉浸在不断变化的战火中。只有涉足战斗，他们才能履行自己的职责，根据地面上不断变化的局势调整战术，执行战争领袖的命令。",
	"Angels of the Boros Legion view themselves as the embodiments of what their creator intended. They are fierce warriors devoted to justice and dedicated to protecting the weak against evil and oppression. They are commanders, advisors, strategists, and soldiers. Their presence in battle inspires the mortal soldiers of the legion with righteous zeal.": "波罗军团的天使将自己视为创造者意图的化身。他们是致力于正义的凶猛战士，致力于保护弱者免受邪恶和压迫。他们是指挥官、顾问、战略家和士兵。他们在战斗中的存在激发了军团的凡人士兵的正义热情。",
	"Most Boros soldiers assume that angels are paragons of goodness, wisdom, and mercy. The reality is that angels aren't immune to the temptations of corruption, and the necessities of political machination can compromise the best of them.": "大多数博罗士兵认为天使是善良、智慧和仁慈的典范。现实情况是，天使对腐败的诱惑没有免疫力，而政治阴谋的需要可以使他们中最好的人妥协。",
	"The wisest, most visionary angels are responsible for forming and implementing the military strategy of the Boros Legion. Since they are immortal, their plans might span centuries, and they have been known to accept decades of losses as a reasonable cost for a more significant victory many years later. These warleaders have the statistics of planetars or solars (as presented in the Monster Manual), but their appearance is similar to other Boros angels.": "最有智慧、最有远见的天使负责形成和实施波罗斯军团的军事战略。由于他们是不朽的，他们的计划可能会跨越几个世纪，而且他们已经知道接受几十年的损失作为多年后更重大胜利的合理代价。这些战争领袖拥有行星人或索拉人的统计资料（如《怪物手册》所介绍的），但他们的外表与其他波罗斯天使相似。",
	"Nearly all the innovation and advancement in Simic bioengineering comes from the work of biomancers. Specialists in hybridizing and altering creatures through a mixture of science and magic, they have spawned countless hybrids and krasis in search of the perfect union between nature and civilization.": "西米克生物工程的几乎所有创新和进步都来自生物学家的工作。他们是通过科学和魔法的结合来杂交和改变生物的专家，他们已经产生了无数的混血儿和克拉西，以寻求自然和文明的完美结合。",
	"A blistercoil weird is an anthropomorphic brute formed from water and molten rock. It absorbs energy from magical fire, causing its oozelike body to increase in size. During one disastrous experiment, Izzet researchers observed a blistercoil weird expanding to fill a six-story workshop before it released all its excess energy in an enormous explosion and returned to its original size.": "水泡怪是一种由水和熔岩形成的拟人化的野蛮人。它从魔法之火中吸收能量，使其渗水的身体变得越来越大。在一次灾难性的实验中，伊泽特的研究人员观察到一个水泡怪人扩大到填满了一个六层楼的车间，然后它在一次巨大的爆炸中释放了所有多余的能量，恢复到原来的大小。",
	"Weirds are the products of Izzet League experiments intended to combine two opposing elemental types in the hope of creating elementals that were more stable than the norm and easier to control. As commonly happens with Izzet experiments, the outcome was the exact opposite. Weirds are even wilder and more unpredictable than elementals of either of their component elements. Nevertheless, they can make potent guardian creatures and can be urged into fighting on behalf of their creators.": "Weirds是Izzet联盟实验的产物，目的是将两种对立的元素类型结合起来，希望能创造出比普通元素更稳定、更容易控制的元素。正如Izzet实验通常发生的那样，结果恰恰相反。鸟类比其组成元素中的任何一种元素更狂野、更不可预测。然而，它们可以成为强有力的守护生物，并可以被敦促代表它们的创造者进行战斗。",
	"An Izzet weird doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "一个伊泽特人的怪人不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Plenty of blood drinkers haunt Ravnica's alleys and sewers, preying on those who are foolish enough to leave the relative safety of the crowds.": "大量的饮血者在拉夫尼卡的小巷和下水道中出没，捕食那些愚蠢到离开相对安全的人群的人。",
	"Vampires thrive in the Orzhov Syndicate, where they can collect tithes and payments from their debtors in the form of blood. Their undead nature gives them the same immortality enjoyed by the oligarch spirits, but they remain capable of experiencing all the delights of their corporeal forms. In contrast to Orzhov spirits, they also retain their personalities, which are almost uniformly cruel.": "吸血鬼在奥尔佐夫集团中蓬勃发展，他们可以以血液的形式向债务人收取什一税和付款。他们不死的本性使他们享有和寡头精神一样的不朽性，但他们仍然能够体验到肉体形式的所有乐趣。与奥尔佐夫鬼魂相比，他们还保留了自己的个性，这些个性几乎都是残忍的。",
	"Consuming a creature's blood creates a sort of empathic bond that allows the blood drinker vampire to exert some magical influence over its victim.": "饮用一个生物的血会产生一种移情作用，使饮血的吸血鬼能够对其受害者施加一些神奇的影响。",
	"Creatures of the night, vampires are ageless undead beings who subsist on the blood of the living. They are fierce predators who mask their ravenous thirst behind a facade of sophistication and sensuality. Those who sip blood from golden chalices are no less voracious than those who tear out their victims' throats with their fangs; they just hide it better.": "吸血鬼是黑夜中的生物，是以活人的血液为生的不死生物。他们是凶猛的掠夺者，在复杂和感性的外表下掩盖他们贪婪的渴望。那些从金杯中吸血的人与那些用獠牙撕开受害者喉咙的人一样贪婪；他们只是隐藏得更好。",
	"The vampires of Ravnica differ from those in the Monster Manual in important ways. They lack the traits and abilities that those other vampires boast, but also lack the weaknesses that hinder such vampires. What they have in common is an unquenchable thirst for the blood that sustains their undead existence.": "拉夫尼卡的吸血鬼与《怪物手册》中的吸血鬼有很大不同。他们缺乏其他吸血鬼所拥有的特征和能力，但也缺乏阻碍这些吸血鬼的弱点。他们的共同点是对维持其不死之身的血液有着无止境的渴求。",
	"Blood witches imagine themselves to be the intermediaries between Rakdos and his cult-the pinnacle of his priesthood, his trusted advisors, and the messengers who communicate his will to the scattered troupes and ringmasters. The Cult of Rakdos recognizes no authority but Rakdos, and the demon lord requires no advisors. Nonetheless, the blood witches are smart, charismatic, and powerful, so their voices do carry some weight.": "血巫师把自己想象成拉克多和他的崇拜者之间的中间人--他的神职的顶峰，他信任的顾问，以及把他的意志传达给分散的剧团和擂主的信差。拉克多教派不承认除拉克多以外的任何权威，恶魔领主也不需要任何顾问。不过，血巫师们很聪明，有魅力，而且很强大，所以他们的声音确实有一定分量。",
	"Blood witches strive both to protect the cult from external interference and to punish those who bring harm to the guild. They claim grandiose titles, such as Tormentor of the Wojek, as a way of mocking their intended victims.": "血巫师既要努力保护邪教免受外部干扰，又要惩罚那些给公会带来伤害的人。他们宣称自己拥有宏大的头衔，例如 \"沃杰克的折磨者\"，以此来嘲弄他们预定的受害者。",
	"Giants in the Cult of Rakdos act as enforcers, bouncers, and sometimes even pillars, holding the mobile platforms that serve as stages for Rakdos performances. Like other members of the cult, giants thrill to the violence of those shows. Though they can seem entranced by the horror unfolding on the stage, they react quickly and brutally to any interruption of the performance.": "拉克多教派的巨人充当执法者、保镖，有时甚至是支柱，支撑着作为拉克多表演舞台的移动平台。和邪教的其他成员一样，巨人也对这些表演的暴力感到兴奋。尽管他们似乎被舞台上展开的恐怖活动所吸引，但他们对任何表演的中断都会做出迅速而残忍的反应。",
	"Giants use their tremendous size and strength to advance the cause of no less than four guilds. In the Boros Legion and the Orzhov Syndicate, they are cunning soldiers. The giants of the Cult of Rakdos and the Gruul Clans are no less effective but lack discipline.": "巨人利用他们巨大的体型和力量来推动不少于四个公会的事业。在波罗斯军团和奥尔佐夫集团，他们是狡猾的士兵。拉克多斯教派和格鲁尔部族的巨人也同样有效，但缺乏纪律性。",
	"For decades, the enormous cyclops Borborygmos has commanded the respect and obedience of the Gruul Clans by defeating all who challenged him. He embodies the raging fire that the Gruul believe burns in their bellies, and his wrath toward the civilization of Ravnica knows no bounds.": "几十年来，巨大的独眼巨人Borborygmos打败了所有挑战他的人，赢得了格鲁尔族人的尊重和服从。他体现了格鲁尔人认为在他们肚子里燃烧的熊熊烈火，他对拉夫尼卡文明的愤怒是无止境的。",
	"Borborygmos leads the Burning Tree clan, which is the largest and most diverse of the Gruul Clans. He is almost always accompanied by other members of his clan-not because he needs their protection, but because they might need his. His companions include creatures ranging from burly giants to cowering goblins.": "Borborygmos领导燃烧之树部族，该部族是格鲁尔部族中最大和最多样化的。他几乎总是由他的部族的其他成员陪同--不是因为他需要他们的保护，而是因为他们可能需要他的保护。他的同伴包括从魁梧的巨人到畏缩的地精等各种生物。",
	"The Gruul follow strength, and Borborygmos holds his position only because he has proved stronger than any challenger.": "格鲁尔人崇尚力量，博博里格莫斯之所以能保持自己的地位，只是因为他已经证明比任何挑战者都强。",
	"Cacklers are small, jabbering jesters that spice up Rakdos performances with their chaotic antics. Their incessant cackling can inspire uncontrollable laughter by making everything—even the most horrifying spectacles—seem hilarious. Some cacklers excel at vocal mimicry and perform as impressionists; others put their sadistic bent to use by lurking in shadows and terrifying passersby. Rakdos performers enjoy dressing cacklers in a variety of masks, hats, and costumes to lampoon public figures.": "呱呱叫者是小型的、叽叽喳喳的小丑，他们用混乱的滑稽动作为拉克多斯的表演增色。他们不间断的笑声可以激发出无法控制的笑声，使一切--即使是最可怕的景象--都显得滑稽可笑。一些咯咯笑的人擅长声乐模仿，并作为印象派演员表演；其他人则通过潜伏在阴影中恐吓路人来发挥他们的虐待狂倾向。Rakdos表演者喜欢给笑匠戴上各种面具、帽子和服装，以嘲弄公众人物。",
	"Just as angels are incarnations of the ideals of justice, demons embody depraved impulses: selfishness, cruelty, hatred, greed, and lust for power. Demons are strongly associated with the Cult of Rakdos; in fact, the demons of Ravnica might have been created by Rakdos in the same way that angels were created by the Boros Legion's founder. As a demon lord who has chosen to live in Ravnica, Rakdos claims authority over all the demons of this world-even if some of them, ambitious and headstrong as demons are, rebel against his authority.": "正如天使是正义理想的化身，恶魔体现了堕落的冲动：自私、残忍、仇恨、贪婪和对权力的渴望。恶魔与拉克多斯教派有着密切的联系；事实上，拉夫尼卡的恶魔可能是由拉克多斯创造的，就像天使是由波洛军团的创始人创造一样。作为一个选择生活在拉夫尼卡的恶魔领主，拉克多斯宣称对这个世界上所有的恶魔都有权威--即使其中有些恶魔野心勃勃，刚愎自用，反叛他的权威。",
	"Demons are agents of destruction that work their acts of terror in plain sight under the auspices of the Cult of Rakdos. They exhibit their cruelty in dramatic performances that leave the audience members blood-soaked but ecstatic. They incite mob riots that raze entire city blocks. The only thing demons fear is Rakdos himself, who doesn't tolerate rivals and hates to be upstaged.": "恶魔是毁灭的代理人，在拉克多斯教的支持下，在众目睽睽之下实施恐怖行为。他们在戏剧性的表演中展示他们的残忍，让观众们血流成河却欣喜若狂。他们煽动暴民骚乱，将整个城市街区夷为平地。恶魔们唯一害怕的是拉克多斯本人，他不容忍对手，也不喜欢被人抢了风头。",
	"In the deep sinkholes that serve as laboratories and guildhalls for the Simic Combine, biomancers employ a combination of magic and scientific method to create novel life forms. They coax new morphologies from existing creatures or combine traits from multiple organisms into one, producing the creatures known as krasis. Some krasis are unique creatures that can't reproduce. A few multiply and become part of the guild's standard menagerie.": "在作为西米克联合体的实验室和行宫的深邃天坑中，生物学家运用魔法和科学方法的结合来创造新的生命形式。他们从现有的生物中哄骗新的形态，或者将多种生物的特征结合到一起，产生被称为krasis的生物。有些krasis是独特的生物，不能繁殖。少数会繁殖，并成为公会的标准动物群的一部分。",
	"To create a krasis, choose the appropriate stat block: category 1 (Medium), category 2 (Large), or category 3 (Huge). Then roll once on the Major Adaptations table and once on the Minor Adaptations table (or choose an option from each table) to determine its additional characteristics. The potency of some adaptations varies based on the category of the krasis, as indicated in the descriptions of those adaptations.": "要创建一个krasis，选择适当的属性块：类别1（中型），类别2（大型），或类别3（巨大）。然后在主要适应表和次要适应表上各掷一次（或从每个表中选择一个选项），以确定它的额外特性。一些适应物的效力根据克拉西斯的类别而不同，如这些适应物的描述中所示。",
	"Just a few examples of krasis are the battering krasis (a fusion of hammerhead shark and a powerfully built beast), the crocanura (a crocodile-frog), the drakewing krasis (a lizard-drake), the teratosuchus (a crocodile-crab), the shambleshark (a shark-crab), and the sharktocrab (an improved shambleshark that includes octopus elements as well).": "仅举几个krasis的例子，如battering krasis（融合了锤头鲨和强大的野兽）、crocanura（鳄鱼-青蛙）、drakewing krasis（蜥蜴-rake）、teratosuchus（鳄鱼-螃蟹）、shambleshark（鲨鱼-螃蟹）和sharktocrab（一种改进的shambleshark，也包括章鱼元素）。",
	"Acidic Skin. Any creature that touches the krasis or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 2 ({@damage 1d4}) acid damage (category 1), 4 ({@damage 1d8}) acid damage (category 2), or 6 ({@damage 1d12}) acid damage (category 3).": "酸性皮肤。任何生物在5英尺范围内接触到克拉西斯或用近战攻击击中它，都会受到2({@damage 1d4}的酸性伤害（第一类），4({@damage 1d8}的酸性伤害（第二类），或6({@damage 1d12}的酸性伤害（第三类）。",
	"Armored Hide. The krasis has better natural armor afforded by a shell or thick scales, increasing its Armor Class by 4.": "装甲的皮。克拉西斯有更好的自然护甲，由外壳或厚鳞片提供，使其护甲等级增加4。",
	"Bioluminescent Markings. The krasis has glowing patterns on its skin that take the shape of defensive runes, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.": "生物发光的标记。克拉西斯的皮肤上有发光的图案，呈防御性符文的形状，使它在面对法术和其他魔法效果时有优势。",
	"Flight. The krasis has wings and gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed.": "飞行。克拉西斯有翅膀，并获得相当于其行走速度的飞行速度。",
	"Regeneration. The krasis regains hit points (2 for a category 1, 5 for a category 2, and 10 for a category 3) at the start of each of its turns if it has at least 1 hit point.": "再生。如果克拉西斯至少有1个命中点，它就会在每个回合开始时重新获得命中点（1类为2，2类为5，3类为10）。",
	"Amorphous Structure. The krasis can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.": "无定形结构。克拉西斯可以在1英寸宽的狭窄空间内移动而不受到挤压。",
	"Aquatic. The krasis gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed.": "水生。克拉西斯获得的游泳速度与它的步行速度相等。",
	"Climbing Speed. The krasis gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.": "攀爬速度。克拉西斯获得的攀爬速度与它的步行速度相等。",
	"Heightened Awareness. The krasis can't be surprised, as a result of having sensitive barbels like a catfish, stereoscopic vision like a chameleon, a tongue like a snake, eye stalks like a lobster, or an array of several eyes.": "高度的意识。由于拥有像鲶鱼一样敏感的倒钩，像变色龙一样的立体视觉，像蛇一样的舌头，像龙虾一样的眼梗，或者几只眼睛组成的阵列，克拉西斯不能感到惊讶。",
	"Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). While underwater, the krasis can use a bonus action to expel a cloud of ink and then move up to its speed. The ink cloud is stationary and fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point in the krasis's space before it moves. The sphere is heavily obscured until the ink disperses after 1 minute. A strong current also disperses the ink cloud.": "墨水云（短时或长时休息后充能）。当在水下时，克拉西斯可以使用一个额外的动作来排出一团墨水，然后以其速度移动。墨水云是静止的，在它移动之前，会填满一个以克拉西斯空间中的一个点为中心的20英尺半径的球体。该球体被严重遮蔽，直到1分钟后墨水散去。强大的水流也会驱散墨水云。",
	"Leaping Legs. With or without a running start, the krasis's long jump is 20 feet (category 1), 30 feet (category 2), or 40 feet (category 3). Its high jump is 10 feet (category 1), 20 feet (category 2), or 30 feet (category 3).": "跳跃的腿。无论是否有跑步起步，克拉西斯的跳远是20英尺（第一类），30英尺（第二类），或40英尺（第三类）。它的跳高是10英尺（第一类）、20英尺（第二类）或30英尺（第三类）。",
	"The lush forests that once grew on Ravnica are gone, but the dryads remain, striving to bring the sprawling city and the verdant green of nature into harmony. Dryads believe that their efforts are the will of Mat'Selesnya, the soul of the world, and they spread their teachings through every Selesnya enclave.": "曾经生长在拉夫尼卡的郁郁葱葱的森林已经不复存在，但干尸们仍然存在，他们努力使无垠的城市和自然界的青葱绿意达到和谐。干尸相信他们的努力是Mat'Selesnya的意志，是世界的灵魂，他们通过每个Selesnya飞地传播他们的教义。",
	"Thanks to their attunement to Mat'Selesnya, dryads serve as visionaries and spiritual intermediaries for the Selesnya Conclave. They hold positions of great respect as spiritual leaders, and also share their vision of harmonious construction as architects, working with stonemasons and woodshapers to create Selesnya enclaves.": "由于与马特-塞勒斯尼亚（Mat'Selesnya）的契合，干尸成为塞勒斯尼亚协约国的愿景者和精神中介。他们作为精神领袖受到了极大的尊重，也作为建筑师分享他们对和谐建设的看法，与石匠和木工一起创造塞勒斯尼亚飞地。",
	"When leading its guild into battle, a dryad rides a magically summoned creature woven of living branches, vines, and grasses and imbued with a fey spirit.": "当带领公会作战时，干尸会骑着一个由活的树枝、藤蔓和草编织而成的魔法召唤物，并被注入了精灵的精神。",
	"While chemisters focus on inventing new tools, weapons, and other devices for the guild to use, the role of a blastseeker is to put those devices to work. Despite the name, not all such devices produce explosions, but all the most interesting ones (from the Izzet perspective) do.": "化学家专注于发明新的工具、武器和其他供公会使用的装置，而爆破师的作用是将这些装置投入使用。尽管名字叫爆炸，但并不是所有这些设备都会产生爆炸，但所有最有趣的设备（从Izzet的角度来看）都会产生爆炸。",
	"Deathpact angels dwell in the grandest of Orzhov cathedrals, where they surround themselves with wealth and wretched vassals that are utterly in their thrall.": "死亡影响的天使居住在最宏伟的奥尔佐夫大教堂里，他们在那里围绕着财富和完全受他们支配的可怜的附庸。",
	"Posing as a beneficent god, a deathpact angel attracts petitioners who beg the angel for blessings: wealth, prestige, health, revenge, and the like. Imagining itself generous and merciful, the angel usually tries to grant the petitioners what they seek by using its abilities, drawing from its hoard of riches, or extorting favors from other members of the guild. True to the spirit of the Orzhov, though, the angel doesn't bestow these gifts out of kindness, but for the sake of gaining fanatical followers who owe it life debts.": "死亡影响天使冒充仁慈的神灵，吸引着那些乞求天使赐福的人：财富、声望、健康、复仇，等等。天使想象自己是慷慨和仁慈的，通常试图通过使用它的能力，从它的财富囤积中提取，或者从公会的其他成员那里勒索好处，来给予请愿者他们所寻求的东西。不过，忠实于奥尔佐夫的精神，天使并不是出于仁慈而赐予这些礼物，而是为了获得狂热的追随者，因为他们欠了它的命。",
	"Those who receive favors from a deathpact angel incur a debt that they carry with fervent devotion. They regularly bring trinkets and offerings to the angel, no longer asking or expecting anything in return, and even willingly offer up their mortal lives for their angelic patron. Even after death, these debtors continue to serve the angel and the Orzhov Syndicate as indentured spirits (described later in this chapter).": "那些从死亡影响天使那里得到恩惠的人产生了一种债务，他们带着狂热的虔诚。他们定期给天使带去饰品和供品，不再要求或期待任何回报，甚至愿意为他们的天使守护者献出自己的凡人生命。即使在死后，这些债务人也会继续作为契约精神为天使和奥尔佐夫集团服务（在本章后面描述）。",
	"Debts Paid": "已支付的债务",
	"Few angels find anything appealing in the corruption and decadence embodied by the Orzhov Syndicate, since such a society is fundamentally antithetical to their natures, but disillusionment can seduce even immortal beings. When cynicism takes root in an angel's heart, when questions undermine devotion to the cause of justice, when strength becomes a tool to lord over the weak, the Orzhov Syndicate is there to welcome the angel with open arms, offering status, respect, and power.": "很少有天使会发现奥尔佐夫集团所体现的腐败和堕落有什么吸引人的地方，因为这样的社会从根本上说是与他们的本性背道而驰的，但幻灭甚至可以引诱不朽的生命。当愤世嫉俗在天使的心中扎根，当问题破坏了对正义事业的奉献，当力量成为凌驾于弱者之上的工具，奥尔佐夫集团就会张开双臂欢迎天使，提供地位、尊重和权力。",
	"Orzhov angels might claim positions as executioners, commanders, or power brokers, but more often they carve out their own place in the guild, standing apart from the otherwise rigid hierarchy of the Orzhov.": "奥热夫天使可能会声称自己是刽子手、指挥官或权力经纪人，但更多时候他们会在公会中开辟自己的位置，从奥热夫其他僵化的等级制度中分离出来。",
	"Powerful spellcasters of the Devkarin elves, steeped in Golgari magic, can transcend death to become liches. For them, life and death don't merely chase each other in an inevitable cycle; the two can intersect, and at that nexus the liches find immense power, which commands the awe, envy, and fear of other Golgari.": "Devkarin精灵中强大的施法者，深受Golgari魔法的熏陶，可以超越死亡，成为地衣。对他们来说，生命和死亡不仅仅是在一个不可避免的循环中相互追逐；两者可以相交，在这个交汇点上，地衣人发现了巨大的力量，这让其他戈尔加里人感到敬畏、羡慕和恐惧。",
	"Unlike the shambling zombies they command, liches retain their memories, their personalities, and especially their ambition. They also retain the grace and stature of living elves, but their bodies are in a constant state of slow decay. Various forms of fungus grow in and over the rotting flesh to hold the body together.": "与他们指挥的摇摇欲坠的僵尸不同，地衣保留了他们的记忆，他们的个性，尤其是他们的野心。他们还保留着活的精灵的优雅和身材，但他们的身体却一直处于缓慢腐烂的状态。各种形式的真菌在腐烂的肉体里和上面生长，将身体固定在一起。",
	"The lich doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "巫师不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",

	"The druids of the Old Ways believe that civilization will never be eradicated by scattered raids and petty skirmishes. They cling to the idea of a coming apocalypse, the End-Raze, when Ilharg's hoofs will trample every brick and stone of Ravnica's soaring skylines to rubble. The world will return to a state of nature in which the lawless code of muscle and savagery will reign once again.": "旧道的德鲁伊们相信，文明永远不会被零星的突袭和小规模的冲突所根除。他们坚信即将到来的天启，即 \"终结者\"（End-Raze），届时伊尔哈格的铁蹄会将拉夫尼卡高耸的天际线上的每一块砖石都踩成废墟。世界将恢复到自然状态，其中无法无天的肌肉和野蛮的代码将再次统治。",
	"A felidar is a celestial creature whose nature reflects an inherent devotion to law and order. It resembles an enormous cat with two pairs of downward-sloping horns and prominent teeth.

	"Nearly every felidar forms a close bond with one other creature. Winged felidars almost always bond with archons, joining in their relentless pursuit of justice. Other felidars ally with members of the Azorius Senate and form bonds with high-ranking justiciars and ministers, aiding them in enforcing the law and tracking down criminals. Some Azorius felidars form bonds with important prisoners in Azorius custody, ensuring that the felidars can track down the felons if they escape custody.": "几乎每一个猫人都会与另一种生物形成密切的联系。有翅膀的猫人几乎总是与大主教结合，加入他们对正义的无情追求。其他猫人与阿索里乌斯元老院的成员结盟，并与高级司法官和部长们建立联系，协助他们执行法律和追踪罪犯。一些Azorius猫人与Azorius羁押的重要囚犯建立了联系，确保猫人能够在重罪犯逃脱羁押时追踪到他们。",

	"In an effort to create a weird that could be more easily controlled, Izzet mages tried binding elemental lightning, fire, and smoke into a framework made of the magical alloy mizzium.

	"At least three guilds have been known to compel horrors into service. For House Dimir, horrors spread fear and despair in the citizenry and carry out assassinations or kidnappings against well-protected targets.

	"Galvanice weirds seem to be the epitome of weird technology. Indeed, they serve willingly, with cheerful stupidity, as guardians and laborers in Izzet workshops.

Still, most Izzet researchers find that their usefulness outweighs this risk.": "Galvanice weirds似乎是怪异技术的缩影。事实上，他们心甘情愿地以愉快的愚蠢的方式，在伊泽特工场中充当守护者和劳动者。它们将坚硬的冰元素身体与赋予它们生命的闪电核心结合在一起。如果一个怪人被摧毁，冰就会碎裂，闪电就会向外噼啪作响，产生危险的爆炸。然而，大多数伊泽特研究人员发现，它们的作用超过了这种风险。",

These giants are guards and gatekeepers, well represented in the Sunhome Guard, as well as powerful muscle supporting Boros missions.": "Boros军团中的大多数巨人都来自一个单一的部族，即Skorskal，该部族长期以来一直与格鲁尔部族不和。这些巨人是卫兵和守门员，在太阳之家卫队中有很好的代表，也是支持波罗斯任务的强大力量。",
	"Giants of the Skorskal clan are often assigned to protect Boros garrisons and forts throughout Ravnica.

	"The Golgari guildmaster is a Devkarin necromancer and lich named Jarad Vod Savo.

	"Jarad doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "杰拉德不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"The death priests occupy the highest roles in kraul society. They lead the buzzing chants of the kraul rites.

	"The ghosts of the Obzedat function as a unit, driven by their shared desire to accumulate ever more wealth for the guild. In times of disagreement, the eldest of the council exerts his seniority to bend the council to his will.": "奥布扎特的鬼魂们作为一个整体运作，受他们为公会积累更多财富的共同愿望所驱使。在出现分歧的时候，理事会中最年长的人发挥他的资历，使理事会屈从于他的意愿。",
	"The head of the council, who gives final approval to its decisions and breaks ties within the group, is Karlov, known as Grandfather. In life, Karlov was the greediest of Orzhov oligarchs, and his many centuries as a spirit have not diminished his hunger for more wealth.": "对理事会的决定给予最终批准并打破集团内部联系的负责人是卡尔洛夫，被称为祖父。在生活中，卡尔洛夫是奥尔佐夫寡头中最贪婪的人，他作为一个精神的许多个世纪并没有减少他对更多财富的渴望。",
	"An Obzedat ghost doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "一个奥比扎特鬼魂不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"The Ghost Council's Traits": "幽灵委员会的特征",
	"Ideal: \"Influence is measured in power, status, and money, but mostly money.\"": "理想：\"影响力的衡量标准是权力、地位和金钱，但主要是金钱。\"",
	"Bond: \"Gather as much as you can while you can, for when you die, you will take it with you.\"": "邦德：\"在你有能力的时候，尽可能多地收集，因为当你死的时候，你会带着它。\"",
	"Flaw: \"Everyone has a price.\"": "缺陷：\"每个人都有一个价格\"。",
	"A few giants join the ranks of the Orzhov Syndicate and serve as guards, executioners, and thugs-the muscle of the guild. The presence of Orzhov giants in markets and streets serves as an effective reminder for business owners to keep their payments up to date.": "一些巨人加入了Orzhov集团的行列，充当守卫、刽子手和打手--公会的肌肉。奥尔佐夫巨人在市场和街道上的存在，有效地提醒了企业主保持他们的付款时间。",
	"Precognitive mages, a rarity among Azorius spellcasters, are capable of capturing glimpses of the future. They are typically employed to anticipate the actions of wanted criminals, thus aiding in their capture.": "预知法师，在阿索里乌斯的施法者中是很罕见的，他们能够捕捉到未来的一瞥。他们通常被用来预测被通缉的罪犯的行动，从而帮助他们被捕。",
	"Rakdos, the demon for whom his cult is named, embodies hedonism. He is also the consummate entertainer, whose mere appearance is an act of grisly performance art. A monstrous figure standing thirty feet tall, spreading enormous wings, crowned with fire and swinging a flaming scythe, Rakdos demands the spotlight. His every entrance is a showstopper.": "拉克多（Rakdos）是他的崇拜者所命名的恶魔，体现了享乐主义。他也是一个完美的艺人，他的出现就是一种可怕的行为艺术。拉克多是一个身高30英尺的怪物，张开巨大的翅膀，头戴火冠，挥舞着燃烧的镰刀，他需要聚光灯。他的每一次出场都是一场表演。",
	"Sometimes after his grand entrance, Rakdos crouches to witness the performances of those who adore him. To them, his opinion is the only one that matters, but he is a demanding spectator. He has seen thousands of years of circus tricks and has no patience for performers who don't give their all. His flaming scythe has brought more than one tepid show to a sudden and spectacular close. Jaded as he is, Rakdos attends his cult's performances only rarely. He often retreats into his lair below the cult's guildhall for months or years at a time, but his followers know that he might emerge at any time to witness the latest spectacle.": "有时，在他隆重的出场之后，拉克多斯蹲下身子，目睹那些崇拜他的人的表演。对他们来说，他的意见是唯一重要的，但他是一个苛刻的观众。他看过几千年的马戏团戏法，对那些不全力以赴的表演者没有耐心。他的火焰镰刀不只一次让不温不火的表演突然间壮观地结束。厌倦了的拉克多斯很少参加他的教派的表演。他经常躲在邪教大厅下面的巢穴里，一待就是几个月或几年，但他的追随者知道，他可能随时出现，目睹最新的奇观。",
	"One of the most effective weapons in the Rakdos cult's arsenal is satire, and a Rakdos lampooner is a virtuoso of that art. Lampooners generally reserve their mockery for people and guilds that have seized an outsized measure of power, those who need to be taken down a peg, rather than piling further humiliation onto those who are already struggling. They use masks, marionettes, or effigies to caricature public figures, or sometimes play pranks on those individuals directly in the streets.": "讽刺是Rakdos邪教最有效的武器之一，而Rakdos讽刺者是这种艺术的大师。讽刺者通常把他们的嘲笑留给那些夺取了巨大权力的人和行会，那些需要被打倒的人，而不是把更多的羞辱堆在那些已经在挣扎的人身上。他们使用面具、提线木偶或雕像来讽刺公众人物，或者有时直接在街上对这些人进行恶作剧。",
	"By offering a place for those of many different talents, the Cult of Rakdos has seen its numbers swell with performing artists, including blade jugglers, fire eaters, and high wire acrobats. Performers carry the message of Rakdos out into the streets: cut loose, free yourself from the bonds of society's mores and expectations, and indulge your desires.": "通过为那些具有不同才能的人提供一个场所，Rakdos教派的表演者人数不断增加，其中包括刀片杂耍者、食火者和高空钢丝杂技者。表演者们将Rakdos的信息带到了街上：放纵自己，从社会习俗和期望的束缚中解放出来，放纵自己的欲望。",
	"Boros reckoners combine physical power and magical prowess, serving as the shock troops of the legion. They are adept at breaking up mobs and organized lines of defense. Sometimes described as living thunderstorms, reckoners charge their bodies with lightning that bursts forth in their spells and lashes out at enemies who harm them. Many reckoners are minotaurs.": "Boros计算者结合了身体的力量和魔法的能力，作为军团的冲击部队。他们善于瓦解暴民和有组织的防线。有时被描述为活雷锋，算盘手在他们的身体里注入闪电，在他们的法术中迸发出来，对伤害他们的敌人进行鞭挞。许多算盘手是牛头人。",
	"Rubblebelt stalkers are scouts and skirmishers for the Gruul Clans. They excel at moving over challenging terrain, whether they're picking their way through treacherous ruins or clambering across rooftops. They favor ambush tactics and avoid confrontations with stronger forces, relying on their superior mobility to make their escape.": "碎石带跟踪者是格鲁尔部族的侦察兵和小兵。他们擅长在具有挑战性的地形上移动，无论是在险恶的废墟中挑衅，还是在屋顶上攀爬。他们喜欢伏击战术，并避免与更强大的部队对抗，依靠他们优越的机动性来进行逃跑。",
	"The most wretched of thrulls are the servitors, small and slender, that serve as playthings for their Orzhov masters. They run trivial errands, transport small items, caper and dance, and keep their masters' expensive robes from trailing on the dirty street. They are utterly loyal, lacking any concept of thinking for themselves.": "最可恶的鸫鸟是仆人，他们身材瘦小，为他们的Orzhov主人充当玩物。他们做一些琐碎的差事，运送一些小东西，打打闹闹，跳跳舞，让他们主人昂贵的长袍不至于在肮脏的街道上留下痕迹。他们完全忠诚，没有任何独立思考的概念。",
	"When the Orzhov Syndicate rips a soul from its body to create a spirit, the cast-off remains go to the fleshmages, who use their necromantic magic to liquefy the corpse and transform it into something useful. These creations become thrulls, obedient slaves that serve in a variety of menial roles: laborers, messengers, beasts of burden, and even fashion accessories for the elite. Whatever tasks they perform, they wear faceplates forged from devalued coinage to conceal their ghastly features.": "当Orzhov集团把灵魂从身体中剥离出来以创造一个灵魂时，被抛弃的残骸会被送到肉体法师那里，他们用他们的死灵魔法把尸体液化，并把它变成有用的东西。这些被创造出来的东西会成为 \"王牌\"，这些听话的奴隶会担任各种琐碎的角色：劳工、信使、野兽，甚至是精英的时尚配件。无论他们执行什么任务，他们都戴着用贬值的硬币铸造的面罩，以掩盖他们可怕的特征。",
	"A thrull doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "鲛人不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Rakdos nightclubs, where visitors can indulge any dark desire and revel in sadistic spectacle, are the favored haunts of the demons known as sires of insanity. Lurking in an underground vault beneath a Rakdos operation, a sire of insanity feasts on the violence, torment, and depravity unfolding above. Occasionally, cultists bring would-be recruits to the demon's presence, and—true to its name—the sire of insanity breaks the new cultist's mind.": "Rakdos的夜总会，游客可以放纵任何黑暗的欲望，陶醉于虐待狂的场面，是被称为精神错乱之主的恶魔最喜欢的地方。潜伏在拉克多行动之下的地下金库中，精神错乱的主人在上面展开的暴力、折磨和堕落中大快朵颐。偶尔，邪教分子会把可能的新成员带到恶魔面前，而精神错乱之主也如其名，打破了新邪教分子的思想。",
	"A sire of insanity is a bloated demon resembling a bipedal lizard. It stands some thirty feet tall and weighs many thousands of pounds, so it tends to keep hidden away in its subterranean lair, working its evil from the shadows.": "疯人院是一个臃肿的恶魔，类似于一只双足蜥蜴。它高约30英尺，重达数千磅，所以它倾向于隐藏在地下巢穴中，从阴影中作恶。",
	"The aerial forces of the Boros Legion-skyknights who fly alongside the angels-take to the air mounted on Skyjek rocs. These avians are named for the skyknights who are also part of the Wojek League, called Skyjeks. From the backs of their rocs, these mounted soldiers carry out reconnaissance missions, bombard enemies on the ground, and engage flying foes.": "Boros军团的空中力量--与天使并肩飞行的天空骑士--骑着Skyjek大炮飞向空中。这些航空兵是以同属Wojek联盟的skyknights命名的，称为Skyjeks。这些骑兵从他们的大象背上执行侦察任务，轰炸地面上的敌人，并与飞行的敌人作战。",
	"The shape of a Skyjek roc's body makes it relatively easy to saddle and ride, and it is typically equipped with armor plating on its head and chest.": "Skyjek大鹏的身体形状使它相对容易上马和骑行，而且它的头部和胸部通常配备有装甲板。",
	"Skyjek rocs are headstrong and impulsive, but their bravery makes them ideal mounts for the Boros knights.": "Skyjek rocs任性而冲动，但他们的勇敢使他们成为Boros骑士的理想坐骑。",
	"Skyswimmers are enormous, predatory leviathans that feed on drakes, rocs, griffins, and anything else they encounter as they soar through the clouds above Ravnica.": "天游者是巨大的、掠夺性的利维坦，当它们在拉夫尼卡上空的云层中翱翔时，以德拉克、大鹏、狮鹫和其他任何遇到的东西为食。",
	"Soldiers are found in many of Ravnica's guilds. The soldier stat block represents a typical member of the rank and file, though weaponry and armor can vary.": "拉夫尼卡的许多公会中都有士兵。士兵的状态块代表了典型的等级和队伍的成员，尽管武器和盔甲可能有所不同。",
	"Gruul sunder shamans are angry giants that channel their rage into brutal attacks that deal overwhelming damage to foes and structures alike.": "格鲁尔-桑德萨满是愤怒的巨人，他们将自己的愤怒转化为残酷的攻击，对敌人和建筑都造成压倒性的伤害。",
	"These shamans sometimes lead hill giants and stone giants that also live among the Gruul Clans. They are occasionally joined by cyclopes, ettins, fomorians, and ogres. Like the rest of the Gruul, they hate the urban development that encroaches on the wilds where they once lived-not least because they have so much difficulty fitting inside the small structures. They delight in destroying such edifices, and in the heat of their rage, they walk through buildings, trample people underfoot, and generally cause as much chaos as possible. They often armor themselves with pieces of buildings and wield columns or other architectural elements as clubs.": "这些巫师有时会领导山地巨人和石像巨人，他们也生活在格鲁尔部族中。偶尔也会有独眼巨人、埃廷斯、福莫里安和食人魔加入他们。和其他格鲁尔族人一样，他们憎恨侵占他们曾经生活过的荒野的城市发展--至少是因为他们很难适应这些小建筑。他们以破坏这些建筑为乐，在愤怒的时候，他们会穿过建筑物，把人踩在脚下，并尽可能地造成混乱。他们经常用建筑物的碎片武装自己，挥舞着柱子或其他建筑元素作为棍棒。",
	"Thought spies form the backbone of House Dimir's covert operations. They are trained in stealth and infiltration, tactics that they supplement with rigorously developed mental abilities. To ensure that no secrets slip through Dimir's fingers, they infiltrate rival guilds. In addition to traditional means of gathering intelligence, thought spies use their magic to spy on the thoughts of their targets.": "思想间谍是迪米尔家族秘密行动的骨干。他们接受过隐蔽和渗透的训练，并以严格发展的精神能力作为战术补充。为了确保没有秘密从迪米尔的指缝中溜走，他们潜入对手的公会。除了传统的情报收集手段外，思想间谍还利用他们的魔法来窥探目标的思想。",
	"The Selesnya guildmaster is an amalgamation of three dryads in body, will, and soul. Each dryad's body extends from a central trunk, so while they possess independent minds, they share a single name-Trostani and a single life force. Usually Trostani communicates the will of the Worldsoul with one voice, but she retains three distinct personalities that embody the three parts of the Selesnyan ideal: order, life, and harmony. In the midst of increasing tensions on Ravnica, the three personalities have recently been at odds over how best to navigate the conclave through such difficult times.": "塞勒斯尼亚公会的会长是三个干尸的身体、意志和灵魂的混合体。每个干尸的身体都是从一个中央主干延伸出来的，所以虽然他们拥有独立的思想，但他们共享一个名字--Trostani和一个生命力。通常情况下，Trostani用一个声音传达世界的意志，但她保留了三个不同的个性，体现了Selesnyan理想的三个部分：秩序、生命和和谐。在拉夫尼卡日益紧张的局势中，这三个人格最近在如何最好地引导协约国度过这样的困难时期上发生了分歧。",
	"Trostani spends most of her time in the towering tree of Vitu-Ghazi, the Selesnya guildhall. There she communes with Mat'Selesnya and with the dryads who lead individual Selesnya communities across Ravnica.": "Trostani大部分时间都呆在Vitu-Ghazi这棵高大的树上，这是塞勒斯尼亚人的市政厅。在那里，她与马特塞勒斯尼亚以及领导整个拉夫尼卡各个塞勒斯尼亚社区的干尸们交流。",
	"The medusas of Ravnica, often called gorgons, are a monstrous race of creatures that appear superficially similar to human women. In place of hair, a gorgon has a writhing mass of black, serpentine cables, and its hands are scaly claws.": "拉夫尼卡的梅杜莎，通常被称为戈尔贡，是一种畸形的生物种族，表面上看起来与人类女性相似。取而代之的是，戈尔贡有一大堆蠕动的黑色蛇形电缆，而它的手是有鳞的爪子。",
	"The gaze of a medusa's glowing eyes causes living tissue to petrify. The transformation is rapid, leaving the victim as a stone statue, usually frozen in a position of abject fear or agony-a fine trophy for the medusa's macabre collection. The medusa must exert its will to effect this transformation, so the gaze of a surprised or friendly Ravnican medusa is harmless.": "美杜莎发光的眼睛的注视会使活体组织僵化。这种转变是迅速的，使受害者成为一尊石像，通常被冻结在极度恐惧或痛苦的状态中--这也是美杜莎可怕的收藏品的最佳战利品。美杜莎必须施展自己的意志来实现这种转变，所以惊讶或友好的拉弗尼卡美杜莎的目光是无害的。",
	"This deadly gaze attack gives medusas a degree of power among the Golgari that is out of proportion with their small numbers. Medusas command a significant share of the guild's smaller cells around Ravnica, and at least one medusa is thought to be angling for control of the entire guild at the moment.": "这种致命的凝视攻击使美杜莎在戈尔加里人中拥有一定程度的权力，这与他们的小数量不成比例。梅杜莎人在拉夫尼卡周围的公会小单元中占有相当大的份额，而且至少有一个梅杜莎人被认为目前正在为控制整个公会而努力。",
	"Not all gorgons are so ambitious; some prefer to simply stalk the endless shadows of the undercity like hungry predators.": "并非所有的戈尔贡人都如此雄心勃勃；有些人更喜欢像饥饿的掠食者一样简单地跟踪城市地下的无尽阴影。",
	"Winged thrulls are at once the most intelligent of Orzhov thrulls (which isn't saying much), as well as the smallest, most unobtrusive, and most mobile. They act as messengers and spies for their Orzhov masters and tend to mimic the mannerisms and movements of the oligarchs they serve.": "有翼鸫鸟是奥尔忠夫鸫鸟中最聪明的（这并不说明什么），也是最小、最不显眼和最机动的。他们为他们的Orzhov主人充当信使和间谍，并倾向于模仿他们所服务的寡头的举止和动作。",
	"Wurms are huge creatures that resemble limbless, wingless dragons. They burrow through the earth and eat virtually anything they come across, and their movement accounts for much of the destruction in the rubblebelt regions of Ravnica. A wurm burrows through loose earth by using deep sonic vibrations to liquefy the earth in front of it and swim through the area. The soil resolidifies and closes behind it. Moving through rock is slower and more difficult, and the wurm leaves a tunnel in its wake. The Gruul Clans appreciate the devastation wurms can create, and the clans sometimes lure them into civilized areas where the destruction can be vast.": "沃尔姆是一种巨大的生物，类似于没有四肢、没有翅膀的龙。它们在土里钻来钻去，几乎吃掉任何它们遇到的东西，它们的运动造成了拉夫尼卡瓦砾带地区的大部分破坏。巫妖在松软的土地上钻来钻去，利用深层的声波振动使它面前的土地液化，并在该地区游动。土壤会重新凝固并在它身后闭合。在岩石中移动的速度更慢，难度更大，而且乌尔姆会在身后留下一条隧道。格鲁尔氏族很欣赏巫妖所能造成的破坏，氏族有时会将它们引诱到文明地区，那里的破坏力会很巨大。",
	"The regal and reticent Prime Speaker Zegana is the merfolk guildmaster of the Simic Combine. She upholds the traditional ways of the guild and its utopian philosophy, which espouses a vision of an ideal world in which nature and civilization coexist in perfect balance. Some people in the guild-members of the Adaptationist faction in particular-argue that her ways are outdated and the guild requires more practical leadership. In response, Zegana maintains that she serves as prime speaker only at the sufferance of the Speakers' Chamber, and if the other speakers wish to replace her, they are certainly within their rights to do so.": "庄重而沉默寡言的首席发言人泽加娜是西米克联合体的人鱼族公会会长。她坚持公会的传统方式和它的乌托邦哲学，支持一个自然和文明完美平衡共存的理想世界的愿景。公会中的一些人，特别是适应派的成员，认为她的方式已经过时，公会需要更实际的领导。作为回应，泽加纳坚持认为，她担任首席发言人只是受制于发言人会议，如果其他发言人希望取代她，他们当然有权利这样做。"
