	"Each abishai was once a mortal who somehow won Tiamat's favor before death and, as a reward, found its soul transformed into a draconic devil to serve at her pleasure in the Nine Hells. Each type of abishai is associated with one of Tiamat's five dragon heads: black, blue, green, red, and white.": "每个abishai都曾经是一个凡人，在死前以某种方式赢得了提亚马特的青睐，作为奖励，发现自己的灵魂变成了一个龙魔，在九层地狱为她服务。每种阿比斯海都与提亚马特的五个龙头之一有关：黑、蓝、绿、红和白。",
	"Tiamat deploys abishais as her agents, sending them forth to represent her interests in the Hells and across the multiverse. Some have simple tasks, such as delivering a message to cultists. Others have greater responsibilities, such as leading large groups, assassinating targets, and serving in armies. In all cases, abishais are fanatically loyal to Tiamat, ready to lay down their lives if needed.": "提亚马特部署阿比莎斯作为她的代理人，派他们去代表她在地狱和整个多元宇宙的利益。有些人的任务很简单，比如向邪教分子传递信息。其他的则有更大的责任，如领导大型团体、暗杀目标和在军队中服役。在所有情况下，阿比沙斯都对提亚马特狂热忠诚，准备在必要时牺牲自己的生命。",
	"Abishais stand outside the normal hierarchy of the Nine Hells, having their own chain of command and ultimately answering to Tiamat (and Asmodeus, when he chooses to use them). Other archdevils can command abishais to work for them, but most archdevils do so rarely, since it is never clear whether an abishai follows Tiamat's orders or Asmodeus's. There is inherent risk in countermanding an order given by Tiamat, but interfering with Asmodeus's plans invites certain destruction.": "Abishais站在九层地狱的正常等级之外，有自己的指挥系统，并最终向提亚马特（和阿斯莫德，当他选择使用他们时）负责。其他大恶魔可以命令阿比莎为他们工作，但大多数大恶魔很少这样做，因为永远不清楚阿比莎是听从提亚马特的命令还是阿斯莫德的命令。违背提亚马特的命令有内在的风险，但干扰阿斯莫德的计划则会招致一定的破坏。",
	"Abjurers specialize in creating protective magical wards. Monarchs, nobles, and other wealthy individuals commonly hire abjurers to provide protection.": "堕落者擅长于创造保护性的魔法护盾。君主、贵族和其他富有的人通常都会雇佣堕落者来提供保护。",
	"It takes six months of steady eating for a {@creature young kruthik|MPMM} to reach adult size. The natural life span of an adult kruthik is roughly seven years.": "一个{@creature young kruthik|MPMM}需要六个月的稳定进食才能达到成年体型。成年克鲁斯克的自然寿命大约为7年。",
	"Adult kruthiks grow spiky protrusions on their legs and can fling these dagger-sized spikes at enemies beyond the reach of their claws.": "成年kruthiks的腿上长有尖锐的突起，可以将这些匕首大小的尖刺甩向爪子够不到的敌人。",
	"Older oblexes, called adults and elders, have eaten so many memories that they can form duplicates of the creatures they have devoured from the substance of their bodies, sending these copies off to lure prey into their clutches while remaining tethered to the slime by long tendrils of goo. These duplicated creatures are indistinguishable from their victims except for a faint sulfurous smell. Oblexes use these duplicates to lead prey into danger or to infiltrate settlements so they can feed on superior victims.": "年长的大蛇，被称为成年人和长者，已经吃了很多记忆，它们可以用身体的物质形成它们所吞噬的生物的复制品，把这些复制品送去引诱猎物进入它们的魔掌，同时用长长的粘液卷轴把它们拴在粘液中。这些复制的生物除了有一股淡淡的硫磺味外，与它们的受害者没有区别。Oblexes利用这些复制体将猎物引向危险，或者潜入定居点，以便它们能以高级受害者为食。",
	"There are many reasons to avoid the way of the lich. An impermanent solution is paradoxical. Take alhoons. They require souls to keep from shriveling. I fail to see the appeal.": "有很多理由要避免走巫师的路。一个无常的解决方案是自相矛盾的。以阿尔霍恩为例。它们需要灵魂来保持不萎缩。我看不出有什么吸引力。",
	"Mind flayers that pursue arcane magic are exiled as deviants, and for them no everlasting communion with an elder brain is possible. The road to lichdom offers an alternative way to escape the permanency of death, but that path is long and fraught with barriers. Alhoons are mind flayers who have used a shortcut to attain a lichlike state.": "追求奥术魔法的心灵传播者被当作异类放逐，对他们来说，不可能与长者的大脑进行永恒的交流。通往巫术王国的道路提供了另一种逃避死亡永恒的方式，但这条道路很漫长，而且充满了障碍。Alhoons是使用捷径来达到巫师状态的心灵传播者。",
	"Elder brains forbid mind flayers from pursuing magic power aside from psionics, but it isn't an interdiction they must often enforce. Illithids brook no masters but members of their own kind, so it isn't in their nature to bow to any god or otherworldly patron. However, wizardry remains a temptation. In the pages of a spellbook, an illithid sees a system to acquire authority. Through the writings of the wizard who penned it, the illithid perceives the workings of a highly intelligent mind. Most mind flayers who find a spellbook react with abhorrence or indifference, but for some, a spellbook is a gateway to a new way of thinking.": "长老们的大脑禁止心灵传播者追求除幻术以外的魔法力量，但这并不是他们必须经常执行的禁令。伊利特人除了自己的同类外，不接受任何主人，所以向任何神或其他世界的守护者低头并不是他们的天性。然而，巫术仍然是一种诱惑。在法术书的书页中，伊里特人看到了一个获得权威的系统。通过撰写这本书的巫师的著作，illithid人看到了一个高度智慧的头脑的运作。大多数发现咒语书的幻术师的反应是憎恶或漠不关心，但对某些人来说，咒语书是通往新思维方式的大门。",
	"For a time, the study of such forbidden texts can be hidden from other illithids and even from an elder brain. Yet eventually, mind flayer arcanists determined to pursue wizardry must flee the colony for their own safety. Once they taste freedom from the colony, some prize their privacy, others seek to commune with similar minds, and still others seek to dominate a colony by elevating themselves to the position of leadership normally held by an elder brain. Regardless, all such arcanists face the same stark fact: when they die, they will not join the host of minds in the elder brain—deviant minds are never accepted as part of the collective. For them, death means oblivion.": "在一段时间内，对这种禁忌文本的研究可以瞒过其他illithids，甚至瞒过长老的大脑。然而，最终，决心追求巫术的掠心者必须为了自己的安全逃离殖民地。一旦他们尝到了离开殖民地的自由，有些人就会珍惜自己的隐私，有些人则寻求与类似的思想交流，还有一些人则试图通过提升自己的地位来支配一个殖民地，而这种领导地位通常是由一个长老的大脑来担任的。无论如何，所有这样的奥术师都面临着同样严峻的事实：当他们死亡时，他们不会加入长老大脑中的心智群体--异端心智永远不会被接受为集体的一部分。对他们来说，死亡意味着遗忘。",
	"Lichdom offers salvation and the prospect of being able to pursue knowledge indefinitely. Yet learning the secret of achieving lichdom requires an arcane spellcaster to be at the apex of power—a significant challenge for mind flayers, given the scarcity of available mentors and training.": "Lichdom提供了救赎和可以无限期追求知识的前景。然而，学习实现lichdom的秘密需要一个奥术施法者达到力量的顶点--鉴于可用的导师和培训的稀缺性，这对心灵传播者来说是一个重大挑战。",
	"Confronting this reality, a group of nine mind flayer arcanists used their arcane magic and psionics to weave a new truth. These nine called themselves the Alhoon, and those who follow in their footsteps are referred to by the same name.": "面对这一现实，一群由九名心灵传播者组成的奥术师用他们的奥术魔法和幻术编织了一个新的真理。这九个人自称为 \"Alhoon\"，那些追随他们脚步的人也被称为同名。",
	"To become alhoons, mind flayer arcanists must cooperate in the creation of a periapt of mind trapping, a fist-sized container made of silver, emerald, and amethyst. The process requires at least three mind flayer arcanists and the sacrifice of an equal number of souls from living victims in a three-day-long ritual of spellcasting and psionic communion. Upon its completion, free-willed undeath is conferred on the mind flayers, turning them into alhoons.": "要想成为Alhoons，心灵传播者奥术师必须合作创造一个心灵陷阱的periapt，一个用银、绿宝石和紫水晶制成的拳头大小的容器。这个过程需要至少3个心灵传播者奥术师，并在为期3天的法术和灵能交流仪式中牺牲同等数量的活体受害者的灵魂。仪式完成后，自由意志的死亡被赋予了思想絮乱者，使他们变成了阿尔霍恩。",
	"Initially, an alhoon can be difficult to distinguish from a normal mind flayer. The most obvious difference is the lack of a mind flayer's ever-present mucus coating. Without that protection, an alhoon's skin becomes dry and cracked, and its eyes might appear shriveled and sunken. Both of these clues are easily missed by someone who hasn't seen a mind flayer. However, in short order, an alhoon's flesh withers away and its empty eye sockets gleam with cold pinpricks of light like those of other liches.": "起初，alhoon很难与普通读心者区分开来。最明显的区别是，它没有一个念力使用者永远存在的粘液涂层。没有这种保护，alhoon的皮肤会变得干燥和开裂，它的眼睛可能会显得干瘪和凹陷。这两个线索都很容易被没有见过噬心者的人错过。然而，在很短的时间内，alhoon的肉体就会枯萎，其空洞的眼窝会像其他地衣一样闪耀着冰冷的针尖之光。",
	"Unlike a true lich's phylactery, the periapt of mind trapping doesn't restore the alhoons to undeath if they are destroyed. Instead, a destroyed alhoon's mind is transferred to the periapt, where it remains in communion with any other trapped alhoon minds, as well as the souls of those sacrificed.": "与真正的巫师法器不同的是，思维陷阱的periapt在被摧毁后并不能使alhoons恢复到不死状态。相反，被摧毁的alhoon的思想会被转移到periapt中，在那里它与任何其他被困住的alhoon思想以及被牺牲者的灵魂保持交流。",
	"The undeath conferred by a periapt of mind trapping lasts only so long as the life of the living victim selected. Thus an alhoon who sacrificed a 200-year-old elf looks forward to a much longer existence than one that sacrificed a 35-year-old person. Alhoons can extend their existence by repeating the ritual with new victims, effectively resetting the clocks for themselves.": "心灵诱捕术所赋予的不死之身只持续到所选择的活体受害者的生命。因此，牺牲了一个200岁的精灵的alhoon期待着比牺牲了一个35岁的人更长久的存在。Alhoons可以通过与新的受害者重复这个仪式来延长他们的存在，有效地为自己重新设置时钟。",
	"Destroying a periapt of mind trapping consigns those trapped within it to oblivion, and thus alhoons often work together to create elaborate protections for their periapt and their preferred ritual site. Sometimes a single alhoon is entrusted with the periapt of mind trapping, but this is a dangerous proposition. Anyone who holds the periapt gains advantage on attacks, saving throws, and checks against the alhoons associated with its creation, and those alhoons in turn suffer disadvantage on attacks, saving throws, and checks against the holder. In addition, the holder can telepathically communicate with any sacrificed soul trapped within, and alhoons within the periapt can speak telepathically with the holder. A creature carrying the periapt can't prevent communication from alhoons but can silence trapped souls.": "破坏思维陷阱的periapt会使被困在里面的人被遗忘，因此alhoons经常一起工作，为他们的periapt和他们喜欢的仪式地点创造精心的保护措施。有时，一个alhoon被委托保管思维陷阱的periapt，但这是一个危险的提议。任何持有periapt的人都会在攻击、蓄力和检查中对与之相关的alhoons产生优势，而这些alhoons反过来在攻击、蓄力和检查中对持有者也会产生不利。此外，持有者可以与被困在其中的任何牺牲的灵魂进行心灵感应，periapt中的alhoons也可以与持有者进行心灵感应。携带periapt的生物不能阻止alhoons的交流，但可以让被困的灵魂安静下来。",
	"An alkilith is easily mistaken for some kind of foul fungal growth that appears on doorways, windows, and other portals. These dripping infestations conceal the demonic nature of the alkilith, making what should be a dire warning appear strange but otherwise innocuous. Wherever alkiliths take root, they weaken the fabric of reality, creating a portal through which even nastier demons can invade.": "铝石很容易被误认为是某种出现在门口、窗户和其他入口处的恶臭真菌。这些滴落的侵染物掩盖了alkilith的恶魔本质，使本应是一个可怕的警告显得很奇怪，但在其他方面是无害的。无论烷烃在哪里扎根，它们都会削弱现实的结构，创造出一个门户，让更多邪恶的恶魔通过它入侵。",
	"The appearance of an alkilith in the world heralds a great wrongness and an imminent catastrophe. An alkilith searches for an aperture such as a window or a door around which it can take root, stretching its body around the opening and anchoring itself with a sticky secretion. If left undisturbed, the opening becomes attuned to the Abyss and eventually becomes a portal to that plane (see \"Planar Portals\" in the Dungeon Master's Guide).": "白石的出现预示着一个巨大的错误和一场即将到来的灾难。白化石会寻找一个可以扎根的孔隙，如窗户或门，在孔隙周围伸展它的身体，用粘性分泌物固定自己。如果不受干扰，这个开口就会与深渊相适应，并最终成为通往那个位面的传送门（参见《地下城主指南》中的 \"位面传送门\"）。",
	"Alkiliths spring from cast-off bits of the hideous, shuddering body of Juiblex. They gradually become self-aware and seek to find their way onto the Material Plane. Since most cultists consider them too risky to summon—they can, after all, create portals to the Abyss—alkiliths must find other escape routes out of their native plane.": "阿尔基里斯是从尤布勒克斯那可怕的、令人颤抖的身体上脱落的碎片中产生的。它们逐渐有了自我意识，并试图找到进入物质世界的途径。由于大多数崇拜者认为召唤他们太过危险--毕竟他们可以创造出通往深渊的门户--因此，阿尔基里斯必须找到其他的逃亡路线，离开他们的本位面。",
	"When a creature uncovers a secret that a powerful being has protected with a mighty curse, the result is often the creation of an allip. Secrets protected in this manner range in scope from a demon lord's true name to the hidden truths of the cosmic order. The creature acquires the secret, but the curse annihilates its body and leaves behind a spectral being composed of fragments from the victim's psyche and overwhelming psychic agony.": "当一个生物发现一个强大的生命用强大的诅咒来保护的秘密时，其结果往往是创造一个Allip。以这种方式保护的秘密范围很广，从恶魔领主的真名到宇宙秩序的隐藏真相。这个生物获得了这个秘密，但诅咒消灭了它的身体，留下了一个由受害者的心灵碎片和压倒性的精神痛苦组成的幽灵。",
	"Every allip is wracked with a horrifying insight that torments what remains of its mind. In the presence of other creatures, an allip seeks to relieve this burden by sharing its secret. The creature can impart only a shard of the knowledge that doomed it, but that piece is enough to wrack the recipient with temporary mental anguish and violent compulsions. The survivors of an allip's attack are sometimes left with a compulsion to learn more about what spawned this monstrosity. Strange phrases echo through their minds, and weird visions occupy their dreams. The sense that some colossal truth sits just outside their recall plagues them for days, months, and sometimes years after their fateful encounter.": "每一个阿利普都被一种可怕的洞察力所困扰，这种洞察力折磨着它仅存的思想。在其他生物面前，Allip试图通过分享它的秘密来减轻这种负担。该生物只能传授给它一个注定要失败的知识碎片，但这碎片足以让接受者遭受暂时的精神痛苦和暴力强迫症的折磨。被Allip攻击的幸存者有时会被强迫去了解更多关于这个怪物产生的原因。奇怪的短语在他们的脑海中回荡，奇怪的幻觉占据了他们的梦境。一些巨大的真相就在他们的记忆之外，这种感觉困扰着他们几天、几个月，有时甚至几年之后，他们的命运遭遇。",
	"An allip might attempt to share its lore to escape its curse and enter the afterlife. It can transfer knowledge from its mind by guiding another creature to write down what it knows. This process takes days or possibly weeks. An allip can accomplish this task by lurking in the study or workplace of a scholar. If the allip remains hidden, its victim is gradually overcome by frantic energy. A scholar, driven by sudden insights to work night and day, produces reams of text with little memory of exactly what the documents contain. If the allip succeeds, it passes from the world—and its terrible secret hides somewhere in the scholar's text, waiting to be discovered by its next victim.": "阿利普可能会试图分享它的传说，以摆脱它的诅咒并进入来世。它可以通过引导另一个生物写下它所知道的东西，来转移它头脑中的知识。这个过程需要几天或可能几周。Allip可以通过潜伏在学者的书房或工作场所来完成这项任务。如果Allip保持隐藏，它的受害者会逐渐被疯狂的能量所征服。一个学者在突然的洞察力的驱使下，夜以继日地工作，产生了成堆的文字，但几乎不记得文件到底包含什么。如果Allip成功了，它就会从这个世界上消失--它的可怕的秘密隐藏在学者的文本中的某个地方，等待着被它的下一个受害者发现。",
	"Amnizus lead infernal legions into battle and command guardians at the gateways to the Hells. Amnizus are arrogant, bullying, and ruthless, but they're also highly intelligent tacticians and unfailingly loyal—qualities the hellish archdukes value.": "阿姆尼祖斯（Amnizus）带领地狱军团作战，并在通往地狱的入口处指挥守护者。阿姆尼兹人傲慢、好欺负、无情，但他们也是高度聪明的战术家，并且永远忠诚，这是地狱大公们所看重的品质。",
	"Relying on violence to sustain their existence, angry sorrowsworn—sometimes called the Angry—grow more powerful when their foes fight back. If a creature opts not to attack, though, this sorrowsworn becomes confused, and its attacks weaken. It also has two heads, which bicker with each other incessantly.": "依靠暴力来维持他们的存在，愤怒的悲鸣者--有时被称为愤怒者--在他们的敌人反击时变得更加强大。不过，如果一个生物选择不攻击，这种悲鸣者就会变得混乱，其攻击也会减弱。它也有两个头，彼此不停地争吵着。",
	"Annis hags lair in mountains or hills. These hunchbacked and hump-shouldered hags are the largest and most physically imposing of their kind, standing eight feet tall. They can easily tear a fully grown person apart, but they love hunting the young, preferring their flesh above all others.": "安尼斯女巫的巢穴在山区或丘陵。这些驼背和驼肩的女巫是他们中最大的，也是身体最强壮的，身高8英尺。它们可以轻易地将一个完全成年的人撕碎，但它们喜欢猎杀年轻人，更喜欢他们的肉体。",
	"Annis hags leave tokens of their cruelty at the edges of forests and other areas they claim to provoke fear and distrust in nearby villages and settlements. To an annis hag, nothing is sweeter than making a once-vibrant community {@condition paralyzed} with terror, so folk never venture out at night, strangers are met with suspicion and anger, and parents warn their children: \"Be good, or the annis will get you.\"": "Annis hag在森林边缘和其他他们声称会引起附近村庄和定居点的恐惧和不信任的地区留下了他们残忍的标记。对Annis hag来说，没有什么比让一个曾经充满活力的社区（%0）充满恐惧更让人高兴的了，所以人们从不在晚上冒险，陌生人会受到怀疑和愤怒，父母也会警告他们的孩子。\"要听话，否则Annis会抓住你。",
	"When an annis feels especially cruel, the hag adopts the appearance of a kindly elder, approaches a child in a remote place, and gives them an iron token (described below), through which the child can magically confide in the hag. Over time, \"Granny\" or \"Grampy\" convinces the child that it's okay to do bad deeds—starting with breaking things or wandering without permission, then graduating to pushing someone down the stairs or setting a house on fire. Eventually, the child's terrified family and community face painful decisions of what to do about the seemingly remorseless child.": "当Annis感到特别残忍时，女巫就会采用慈祥的长者的外表，在一个偏远的地方接近一个孩子，并给他们一个铁信物（如下所述），通过这个信物，孩子可以神奇地向女巫倾诉。随着时间的推移，\"奶奶 \"或 \"爷爷 \"让孩子相信做坏事是可以的--从打碎东西或未经允许到处游荡开始，然后发展到把人推下楼梯或放火烧房子。最终，孩子惊恐的家庭和社区面临着痛苦的决定，即如何处理这个看似无情的孩子。",
	"An annis hag can pull out one of their iron teeth or nails and spend 1 minute shaping and polishing it into the form of a coin, a ring, or a tiny mirror.": "一个Annis hag可以拔出他们的一颗铁牙或指甲，并花1分钟将其塑造和打磨成硬币、戒指或小镜子的形式。",
	"Thereafter, any creature that holds this iron token can have a whispered conversation with the hag, provided the creature and the hag are within 10 miles of each other. When the hag speaks through the token, the holder can hear the hag's whisper but not any other sounds at the hag's location. Similarly, the hag can hear the holder of the token but not the noise around it.": "此后，任何持有此铁质令牌的生物都可以与女巫进行低声交谈，前提是该生物和女巫的距离在10英里以内。当女巫通过令牌说话时，持有者可以听到女巫的低语，但听不到女巫所在地的任何其他声音。同样地，女巫可以听到令牌持有人的声音，但不能听到周围的噪音。",
	"A hag can have up to three iron tokens active at one time. As an action, the hag can discern the direction and approximate distance to those active tokens. The hag can deactivate any of those tokens at any distance (no action required), whereupon the token retains its current form but loses its magic.": "一个巫婆在同一时间最多可以有三个铁质令牌处于活动状态。作为一个行动，女巫可以辨别方向和与这些激活的令牌的大致距离。巫婆可以在任何距离停用其中的任何一个令牌（无需行动），这时令牌会保留其当前的形式，但失去其魔力。",
	"Apprentices are novice arcane spellcasters who serve more experienced wizards or attend school. They perform menial work like cooking or cleaning in exchange for education in the ways of magic.": "学徒是为更有经验的巫师服务或上学的新手奥术施法者。他们做一些琐碎的工作，如烹饪或清洁，以换取魔法方面的教育。",

During a time when so many other archdevils have lost their positions, Mammon has never been ousted, which is a testament to Bael's skill on the battlefield.": "魔鬼和恶魔之间的血战已经持续了数个世纪，而且没有结束的迹象，雄心勃勃的大恶魔们有很多机会在持续的斗争中赢得名声、荣耀和权力。巴尔公爵，玛门最重要的附庸之一，因其胜利而赢得了名声和赞誉。贝尔负责领导66个{@creature barbed devil||barbed devils}的连队，事实证明他是一个战术天才，在一次又一次战胜深渊主人的过程中，为自己和主人赢得了尊重。玛门依靠贝尔来保护他的财产，因为贝尔的战斗力很强。在许多其他大恶魔失去地位的时候，玛门从来没有被赶走过，这证明了贝尔在战场上的技巧。",
	"For his accomplishments, Bael has been granted the title of Bronze General. His accolades notwithstanding, he has had a difficult time navigating the quagmire of infernal politics. His critics call him naive, though never to his face. His primary interest has always been leading soldiers in battle, so he finds it frustrating to have his ambitions of ascending to a higher rank constantly stymied by politically shrewd rivals.": "由于他的成就，贝尔被授予青铜将军的称号。尽管他获得了荣誉，但他在地狱政治的泥潭中艰难跋涉。他的批评者称他为天真，尽管从未当面说过。他的主要兴趣一直是在战斗中领导士兵，所以他发现自己升到更高等级的野心不断受到政治上精明的对手的阻挠，这让他感到沮丧。",
	"Bael prefers to make servants out of his adversaries, and mortals bound to his service earn their wretched place by falling victim to his superior stratagems. Bael gladly spares the lives of those he defeats—if they pledge their souls and service to him. Demons are an exception; although he is willing to corrupt almost any other foes, he always destroys demons he defeats.": "贝尔更喜欢让他的对手成为仆人，而被束缚在他手下的凡人则通过成为他高超计谋的牺牲品来获得他们的悲惨地位。贝尔很乐意饶恕那些被他打败的人的生命--如果他们向他保证他们的灵魂和服务。恶魔是个例外；尽管他愿意腐蚀几乎所有其他的敌人，但他总是摧毁被他打败的恶魔。",
	"Bael also welcomes mortals into his service if they can provide him with an advantage in his politicking. He recruits savvy individuals and relies on them to represent his interests at Mammon's court, which leaves him free to pursue his battle lust.": "贝尔也欢迎凡人为他服务，如果他们能在政治上为他提供优势。他招募精明的人，并依靠他们在玛门的法庭上代表他的利益，这样他就可以自由地追求他的战斗欲望。",
	"Despite his lack of interest in affairs outside battle, or perhaps because of it, Bael has gained a small following of cultists. Those who worship at his altar call him the King of Hell, and the most deluded believe that he is the lord of all devils. In arcane circles, certain writings, such as the dreaded Book of Fire, say that Bael revealed the invisibility spell to the world, though some scholars of magic hotly refute such claims. Bael is sometimes depicted as a toad, a cat, a human, or some combination of these forms.": "尽管他对战斗以外的事务缺乏兴趣，或者也许正因为如此，贝尔获得了一小批崇拜者的追随。那些在他的祭坛前膜拜的人称他为 \"地狱之王\"，而最痴心妄想的人认为他是所有魔鬼的主宰。在奥术界，某些著作，如可怕的《火之书》，说贝尔向世界揭示了隐形咒语，尽管一些魔法学者激烈地驳斥了这种说法。贝尔有时被描绘成一只蟾蜍、一只猫、一个人，或这些形式的某种组合。",
	"Native to the Shadowfell, the vicious, predatory balhannoth alters reality in its lair to make the place appear inviting to travelers. A limited form of telepathy enables a balhannoth to identify images of places where its prey expects their needs and desires to be met, such as an inn or a temple offering healing. It then warps reality around itself, hiding itself and remaking its environment to resemble such a place. The imitation is imperfect, but it's good enough to fool greedy or desperate creatures. Once its prey enters the trap, it snatches the targets and teleports away to feed on their fear and despair.": "原产于暗影城，邪恶的、掠夺性的巴尔汉诺斯改变了它巢穴中的现实，使这个地方看起来对旅行者很有吸引力。一种有限的心灵感应使巴尔汉诺斯能够识别其猎物期望得到满足的地方的图像，如旅馆或提供治疗的寺庙。然后它就会扭曲自己周围的现实，隐藏自己并重塑自己的环境，使之与这样的地方相似。这种模仿是不完美的，但它足以欺骗贪婪或绝望的生物。一旦它的猎物进入陷阱，它就会抓住目标并传送走，以他们的恐惧和绝望为食。",
	"Dungeon builders and Underdark tyrants sometimes venture into the Shadowfell to capture balhannoths for use as guardians.": "地牢建造者和地下城暴君有时会冒险进入暗影城，捕捉巴尔汉诺斯作为守护者使用。",
	"In the Shadowfell, balhannoths make their lairs near places inhabited by creatures they hunt. They typically haunt well-traveled roads and paths, snatching people who come along. A balhannoth used as a guardian in the Underdark might lair in caves near Underdark passages and guard the ways in and out of its keepers' enclave.": "在Shadowfell，balhannoths把它们的巢穴建在它们猎杀的生物所居住的地方附近。它们通常在人迹罕至的道路上出没，抢夺走来的人。在暗黑世界中作为守护者的巴尔汉诺斯可能会在暗黑世界通道附近的洞穴中筑巢，并守护着进出其守护者的飞地的道路。",
	"A banderhobb is a hybrid of shadow and flesh. Through vile magic, these components take on an enormous and horrific upright shape resembling a bipedal toad. In this form, a banderhobb temporarily serves its creator as a thug, a thief, and a kidnapper that swallows the unwary.": "Banderhobb是影子和肉体的混合体。通过卑鄙的魔法，这些成分呈现出一种巨大而可怕的直立形状，类似于双足的蟾蜍。在这种形态下，班德霍布会暂时为它的创造者服务，成为一个暴徒、小偷和绑架者，吞噬不小心的人。",
	"Hags have devised a ritual for creating banderhobbs—a hag who knows the ritual might be willing to teach it for the right price. Some other wicked Fey and powerful Fiends also know of the process, as do a few mortal mages.": "女巫们设计了一种制造班德霍布的仪式--知道这种仪式的女巫可能愿意以合适的价格来传授它。其他一些邪恶的费伊人和强大的火人也知道这个过程，还有一些凡人法师也知道。",
	"During its brief existence, a banderhobb attempts to carry out its creator's bidding. It accomplishes its mission with no concern for the harm it suffers or causes. Its only desire is to serve and succeed. A banderhobb that is assigned to track down a target is particularly dangerous when it is provided with a lock of hair, a personal belonging, or another object connected to the target. Possession of such an item allows it to sense the creature's location from as far as a mile away.": "在其短暂的存在期间，Banderhobb试图执行其创造者的命令。它在完成自己的任务时，并不关心它所遭受或造成的伤害。它唯一的愿望是服务和成功。被指派追踪目标的Banderhobb在得到一绺头发、个人物品或其他与目标有关的物品时特别危险。拥有这样的物品可以让它在一英里外感知生物的位置。",
	"A banderhobb fulfills its duties until its existence ends. When it expires, usually several days after its birth, it leaves behind only tarry goo and wisps of shadow. Legends tell of an ominous tower in the Shadowfell where the shadows sometimes reform and banderhobbs roam.": "一个Banderhobb履行其职责，直到其存在结束。当它过期时，通常是在它出生后的几天，它只留下了焦油状的粘液和一缕阴影。传说中，在阴影地带有一座不祥的塔，那里的阴影有时会发生变化，班德霍布会在那里游荡。",
	"Civilization is weakness and brutality is strength in the credo of Baphomet, the Horned King and the Prince of Beasts. He is worshiped by those who want to break the confines of civility and unleash their bestial natures, for Baphomet envisions a world without restraint, where creatures live out their most bloodthirsty desires.": "在巴弗灭的信条中，文明是弱点，残暴是力量，他是有角的国王和野兽的王子。他被那些想打破文明的束缚、释放兽性的人所崇拜，因为巴弗灭设想了一个没有约束的世界，在那里，生物们可以实现他们最嗜血的欲望。",
	"Cults devoted to Baphomet use mazes and complex knots as their emblems. They create secret places to indulge themselves, including labyrinths of the sort their master favors. Bloodstained crowns and weapons of iron and brass decorate their profane altars.": "献给巴弗灭的邪教使用迷宫和复杂的绳结作为他们的标志。他们创造秘密场所来放纵自己，包括他们的主人喜欢的那种迷宫。沾满鲜血的冠冕以及铁和铜的武器装饰着他们虔诚的祭坛。",
	"Over time, a {@cult cult of baphomet|mpmm|cultist of Baphomet} becomes tainted by his influence, gaining bloodshot eyes and coarse, thickening hair. Small horns eventually sprout from the cultist's forehead. In time, a devoted cultist might transform entirely into a minotaur, which is considered the greatest gift of the Prince of Beasts.": "随着时间的推移，一个{@cult cult of baphomet|mpmm|cultist of Baphomet}会被他的影响所玷污，获得血色的眼睛和粗糙的、变厚的头发。小角最终从崇拜者的额头上长出来。随着时间的推移，一个虔诚的崇拜者可能会完全变成一个牛头人，这被认为是野兽王子最大的礼物。",
	"Baphomet appears as a fearsome, 20-foot-tall minotaur with six iron horns. A fiendish light burns in his red eyes. Although he is filled with bestial blood lust, there lies within him a cruel and cunning intellect devoted to subverting all civilization.": "巴弗灭出现时是一个可怕的、20英尺高的牛头人，有六个铁角。他的红色眼睛里燃烧着恶魔般的光芒。虽然他充满了兽性的血腥欲望，但在他的内心深处有一个残酷而狡猾的智慧，致力于颠覆所有的文明。",
	"Baphomet wields a great glaive called Heartcleaver. He also charges his enemies and gores them with his horns, trampling his foes into the earth and rending them with his teeth like a beast.": "巴弗灭挥舞着一把名为 \"裂心 \"的巨大利刃。他也会向他的敌人发起冲锋，用他的角来刺穿他们，把他的敌人踩进土里，像野兽一样用牙齿撕碎他们。",
	"Bards are gifted poets, storytellers, and entertainers who travel far and wide. They're commonly found in taverns or in the company of jolly bands of adventurers, rough-and-tumble mercenaries, and wealthy patrons.": "吟游诗人是有天赋的诗人，讲故事的人，以及游历四方的艺人。他们通常出现在酒馆里，或者与快乐的冒险家队伍、粗犷的雇佣兵和富有的赞助人在一起。",

	"Long ago, the god Maglubiyet—conqueror and then lord of early goblinoids—bargained with the General of Gehenna for aid. The General provided yugoloths, which then died in service to Maglubiyet. Yet when the time came to honor his part of the compact, Maglubiyet reneged on the deal. In vengeance, the General of Gehenna created the soul-devouring barghests to devour goblinoid souls.": "很久以前，神Maglubiyet--征服者，然后是早期地精的领主--与Gehenna将军讨价还价，寻求援助。将军提供了尤格罗特，然后这些尤格罗特为马格鲁比耶特服务而死亡。然而，当履行他的契约的时候，马格鲁比耶特违背了协议。为了报复，地府将军创造了噬魂兽来吞噬地精的灵魂。",
	"The mission of every barghest, implanted in it by the General of Gehenna, is to consume souls. It eats these souls by devouring the bodies of those it kills, preferring goblinoids.": "每一个巴格斯特的任务，都是由地府将军植入的，就是吞噬灵魂。它通过吞噬被它杀死的人的身体来吞噬这些灵魂，更喜欢地精族。",
	"A barghest hungers for the day when it can complete its mission, return to Gehenna, and serve the General directly in his yugoloth legions, but it doesn't kill goblinoids indiscriminately. By devouring the souls of goblinoid leaders and other powerful individuals, a barghest earns elevated status in the afterlife. Barghests typically keep their true nature secret, preying on the occasional lone goblin when the opportunity arises, until they reach adulthood and are capable of seeking out stronger prey. A barghest avoids contact with large, open fires.": "Barghest渴望有一天能完成它的任务，回到地府，并直接在他的yugoloth军团中为将军服务，但它不会不分青红皂白地杀害地精。通过吞噬哥布林人首领和其他有权势的人的灵魂，巴格斯特在来世赢得了更高的地位。Barghests通常对自己的真实本性保密，在有机会的时候捕食偶尔的孤独的地精，直到他们长大成人，有能力寻找更强大的猎物。Barghest避免接触大型的明火。",
	"Any conflagration larger than its body acts as a gateway to Gehenna and banishes it to that plane, where it is likely to be slain or enslaved by a yugoloth for its failure.": "任何大于其身体的火焰都会成为通往地府的通道，并将其放逐到那个位面，在那里它很可能会因为失败而被杀或被尤格罗人奴役。",

	"The knowledge that berbalangs accumulate makes them great sources of information for powerful people traveling the planes. Berbalangs ignore petitioners, however, unless they come bearing a choice secret or the bones of a particularly interesting creature.

	"A bheur hag's skin has the bluish hue of a person who has frozen to death. The hag's hair is white, and the hag is emaciated, with pale eyes surrounded by bruise-colored flesh.

	"Bheur hags are attracted to selfish actions inspired by deadly cold, such as murdering a traveler for a winter coat or chopping down a dryad's grove for firewood.

Bheurs use their ability to manipulate weather to batter villages with freezing cold, hoping to instill a despair that turns folk against each other.": "Bheur hag被致命的寒冷所激发的自私行为所吸引，比如为了一件冬衣而谋杀一个旅行者，或者为了木柴而砍伐干尸的小树林。如果这些行为是无缘无故的，比如一个贪婪的商人为了过冬而囤积多余的食物，而其他人却在挨饿，那么这些行为对Bheur来说就特别甜蜜。Bheurs利用他们操纵天气的能力，用严寒来打击村庄，希望灌输一种绝望的情绪，让人们互相对立。",

If he so chooses, he can speak through a bodak to address his enemies and followers directly.": "波达克是奥库斯的意志在深渊之外的延伸，为恶魔王子的目标和其他爪牙服务。奥卡斯可以回忆起波达克看到或听到的任何东西。如果他愿意，他可以通过波达克直接对他的敌人和追随者说话。",
	"A bodak retains vague impressions of its past life. It seeks out its former allies and enemies alike to destroy them, as its warped soul seeks to erase anything connected to its former life.

	"A boggle can create magical openings to travel short distances or to pilfer items that would otherwise be beyond its reach. To create such a rift in space, a boggle must be adjacent to a space defined by a frame, such as an open window or a doorway, a gap between the bars of a cage, or the opening between the feet of a bed and the floor. The rift is {@condition invisible} and disappears after a few seconds—just enough time for the boggle to step, reach, or attack through it.": "博格可以创造出神奇的开口来进行短距离的旅行，或者偷窃本来无法触及的物品。要在空间中创造这样的裂缝，boggle必须与一个由框架定义的空间相邻，比如一扇打开的窗户或一个门口，一个笼子的栅栏之间的缝隙，或一张床的脚和地板之间的开口。裂缝是{@condition invisible}，并在几秒钟后消失--正好有足够的时间让boggle通过它进行踩踏、接触或攻击。",

	"The most important part of the transformation ritual occurs when the soul of the aspiring lich migrates to a prepared phylactery. If the wizard is too physically or magically weak to compel the soul into its new home, the soul instead seeks out a master—a person within a few miles who has a hate-filled heart. The soul bonds to that person and becomes enslaved to its new master's wishes. The boneclaw forms near its master, sometimes appearing before that individual to receive orders and other times simply seeking to fulfill its master's desires.": "变身仪式最重要的部分发生在有抱负的巫师的灵魂迁移到一个准备好的法器上。如果巫师的身体或魔法太弱，无法强迫灵魂进入它的新家，那么灵魂就会寻找一个主人--在几英里范围内有一颗充满仇恨的心的人。灵魂与那个人结合，成为新主人愿望的奴隶。骨爪在它的主人身边形成，有时出现在那个人面前接受命令，有时只是寻求满足它主人的愿望。",
	"A boneclaw can serve only an evil creature. If its master finds redemption or sincerely turns away from the path of evil, the boneclaw is destroyed. Otherwise, a boneclaw can't be destroyed while its master lives.

Despite its ungainly physiology, a catoblepas resembles a natural animal in its behavior, ambling through its marshy home, munching choice vegetation, eating the occasional bit of carrion, and wallowing in mire. A catoblepas might be found with the one mate it chooses for life and, on occasion, with a calf. A catoblepas attacks anyone that moves too close, especially if guarding its young.": "Catoblepas和它生活的沼泽地一样令人厌恶，它是由臃肿的水牛、恐龙、疣猪和河马的部分组成的。尽管它的生理结构很不雅观，但猫鼬的行为却很像自然界的动物，它在沼泽地的家园里埋头苦干，啃食选择的植物，偶尔吃一点腐肉，并在泥沼中沉溺。一只猫鼬可能会和它选择的一个伴侣一起生活，有时也会和一只小牛一起生活。一只猫鼬会攻击任何走得太近的人，尤其是在看守它的幼崽时。",
	"A catoblepas's stink, like the stench of death mixed with swamp gas and skunk musk, gives it away as being much more ghastly than its appearance suggests. When it is on the attack, a catoblepas reveals the extent of its horrific nature. The creature's serpentine neck has trouble lifting its head, but one glare from its bloodshot eyes can rot flesh. At the end of its tail is a club that can rattle body and soul if it strikes true, leaving a victim unable to act while the catoblepas feasts on its body.": "Catoblepas的臭味，就像死亡的臭味与沼气和臭鼬的麝香混合在一起，让人觉得它比它的外表所显示的要可怕得多。当它开始攻击时，catoblepas就会显示出它的恐怖性质。这种生物的蛇形颈部很难抬起它的头，但它那充满血丝的眼睛一瞪，就能让肉体腐烂。在它的尾巴末端有一根棍子，如果它真的打中了，可以使身体和灵魂摇摇欲坠，让受害者无法行动，而鲶鱼则在其身体上大快朵颐。",
	"A catoblepas's nature as a creature of disease and decay brings out similar characteristics in the creature's swampy habitat. Such a wetland becomes gloomy, tangled, and more fetid than it was before. Beneficial qualities of the environment, such as healing herbs and clean water, become degraded, and swamp gases take on a hint of the catoblepas's foulness. Animals in the area are more aggressive and liable to be diseased. Degenerate creatures are likely to take up residence near a catoblepas's territory, as are those seeking to avoid notice.": "Catoblepas作为一种疾病和腐烂的生物，在其沼泽地的栖息地中也呈现出类似的特征。这样的湿地会变得阴暗、纠结，而且比以前更加腥臭。环境中有益的品质，如治疗的草药和干净的水，变得退化了，沼泽的气体也有了一丝猫鼬的臭味。该地区的动物更具攻击性，容易生病。堕落的生物很可能会在猫鼬的领地附近居住，那些想要避免被注意的生物也是如此。",
	"Ordinary folk rarely see a catoblepas, but the creature has such a feared reputation that stories about it are ingrained in the popular culture. Any rumor of a catoblepas taking up residence nearby is taken to be a bad omen, even if the rumor is proven false. In some lands, the silhouette of a catoblepas, with its tail extended over its body and its head held low, is a baleful heraldic figure signifying death or doom.": "普通人很少看到catoblepas，但这种生物有如此可怕的声誉，以至于关于它的故事在大众文化中根深蒂固。任何关于猫鼬在附近居住的传言都被认为是一个坏兆头，即使这个传言被证明是假的。在一些地方，猫头鹰的轮廓，其尾巴延伸到身体上，头低着，是一个邪恶的预示图形，象征着死亡或厄运。",
	"Sages say that gods of pestilence and rot created catoblepases as embodiments of their influence, while other stories link them to misfortune. Some such tales claim that swamp-dwelling hags tend catoblepases like cattle, drinking the monsters' milk and using them as guardians or pets. Other legends say that those of impure heart can tame a catoblepas and whisper of malevolent warlocks and wicked knights who ride them into battle.": "圣人说，瘟疫和腐烂之神创造了catoblepases，作为其影响力的体现，而其他故事则将它们与不幸联系起来。一些这样的故事声称，居住在沼泽地的女巫像养牛一样照顾catoblepases，喝怪物的奶，把它们当作监护人或宠物。还有一些传说说，那些心地不纯的人可以驯服catoblepas，并低声说，恶毒的术士和邪恶的骑士会骑着它们去战斗。",

	"A cave fisher is a subterranean arachnid with a long snout that houses spinnerets, enabling the creature to produce sticky filaments, much like the strands of a spider's webbing, which the creature uses to snag prey.": "洞穴鱼人是一种地下蛛形纲动物，有一个长长的鼻子，里面有喷丝器，使该生物能够产生粘性的丝线，很像蜘蛛的网线，该生物利用这些丝线来捕获猎物。",
	"A cave fisher usually hunts small animals and is particularly fond of bats, so it stretches a filament over an opening that such prey might travel through. It then climbs to a hiding spot and adheres itself to the surface to rest and wait. When prey blunders into the filament, the cave fisher reels in its meal. A group of cave fishers might work together to cover a large area with filaments, but as soon as one captures potential food, every cave fisher in the area competes for the prize. If a victim escapes from the initial ambush, a cave fisher can reclaim its prey by shooting a filament out to capture it again.": "洞穴捕鱼者通常猎杀小动物，特别喜欢蝙蝠，所以它在这种猎物可能通过的开口上拉出一根丝。然后，它爬到一个隐蔽的地方，把自己贴在表面休息和等待。当猎物误入丝线时，洞穴捕鱼者就会卷起它的食物。一群洞穴捕鱼者可能会一起工作，用丝线覆盖一大片区域，但只要有一只捕到了潜在的食物，该地区的每一只洞穴捕鱼者都会争夺这个奖品。如果一个受害者从最初的埋伏中逃脱，洞穴捕鱼者可以通过射出丝线再次捕获猎物来夺回它。",
	"Scarce food might draw a group of cave fishers up to the surface, into a shadowy canyon or a gloomy forest that features both native animal prey and creatures such as explorers or travelers occasionally moving through the area.": "稀缺的食物可能会吸引一群洞穴捕鱼者上到地面，进入一个阴暗的峡谷或阴暗的森林，其中既有本地动物的猎物，也有探险家或旅行者等生物偶尔经过的地方。",
	"While some folk hunt cave fishers to kill them to harvest their filaments, shells, and blood, others capture cave fisher eggs and rear the hatchlings, which can be trained to guard passages or serve as beasts of war. Cave fishers have a natural aversion to fire, since their blood is flammable. As such, Underdark denizens often use the threat of fire when training them.": "有些人猎杀洞穴鱼，以收获它们的丝、壳和血，有些人则捕捉洞穴鱼的卵，并饲养孵化的小鱼，它们可以被训练成守卫通道或作为战争的野兽。洞穴鱼人对火有天然的厌恶，因为它们的血液是可燃的。因此，地下城居民在训练它们时经常使用火的威胁。",

	"Dedicated to Lolth, chitines are multiarmed bipeds with arachnid qualities. Most live in colonies in the Underdark and fight the enemies of the Demon Queen of Spiders. Long ago, the cult of Lolth first subjected elf prisoners to horrible rituals that transformed them into creatures with both elven and spider traits, which their creators dubbed chitines. The intention was to create servile warriors dedicated first to the cult and then, only by association with it, to Lolth. The goddess found this arrangement unacceptable.": "Chitines致力于Lolth，是具有蛛形结构的多臂双足动物。大多数人生活在暗黑世界的殖民地中，与蜘蛛魔后的敌人作战。很久以前，洛尔思邪教首先对精灵囚犯进行了可怕的仪式，将他们改造成同时具有精灵和蜘蛛特征的生物，他们的创造者称之为chitines。这样做的目的是为了创造出奴役性的战士，首先献给邪教，然后通过与邪教的联系，献给洛尔兹。女神认为这种安排是不可接受的。",
	"As punishment, the Spider Queen twisted her worshipers' rituals. The process usually transformed subjects into the spindly creatures her devotees expected, but occasionally, an elf changed into a choldrith: an arachnid Monstrosity able to command and create more chitines on its own. These choldriths soon led the chitines to rebel and abandon their creators, founding free colonies elsewhere in the Underdark. On occasion, though, colonies can be found in remote, gloomy areas of the surface world, warring against Lolth's enemies.": "作为惩罚，蜘蛛女王扭曲了她崇拜者的仪式。这个过程通常会将臣民变成她的信徒所期望的那种骨瘦如柴的生物，但偶尔，一个精灵会变成一个choldrith：一个能够指挥并自行创造更多chitines的蛛形怪兽。这些choldriths很快就导致chitines反叛并抛弃他们的创造者，在暗黑世界的其他地方建立自由的殖民地。不过，偶尔也能在地表世界的偏远、阴暗的地区找到殖民地，与洛尔兹的敌人作战。",
	"The cult of Lolth still creates chitines as the need arises. Outside the presence of a choldrith, chitines make good workers, and they can be useful if the cult finds an independent chitine colony and want to infiltrate it. If the creation process yields a choldrith, though, the cult destroys the creature.": "Lolth邪教仍然在需要时创造chitines。在有choldrith存在的情况下，chitines是很好的工人，如果邪教组织发现一个独立的chitine殖民地并想渗透进去，它们可能会很有用。不过，如果在创造过程中产生了choldrith，邪教就会毁掉这种生物。",
	"As servants of Lolth, chitines love spiders. They rear spiders and similar arachnids, such as cave fishers (also in this book). Chitine colonies erect shrines to Lolth that serve as beacons, attracting spiders and other beings that serve her. Anywhere chitines set up a colony quickly becomes a webshrouded, gloomy, and treacherous place.": "作为Lolth的仆人，Chitines喜欢蜘蛛。他们饲养蜘蛛和类似的蛛形纲动物，如洞穴鱼人（也在本书中）。Chitine殖民地为Lolth建立了神龛，作为信标，吸引蜘蛛和其他为她服务的生物。凡是奇蒂纳人建立殖民地的地方，很快就会变成一个网络密布、阴森恐怖的地方。",
	"Chitines resemble spiders, but they behave more like social insects such as ants. They are divided into worker and warrior castes; choldriths, when present, occupy the top levels of a colony's hierarchy. Each chitine has a social position that comes with duties related to that rank, and all are expected to sacrifice themselves to protect the colony's choldriths. Every chitine has spinnerets and slowly produces webbing that is used to build floors, walls, structures, objects, and traps that benefit the colony. A warrior might be responsible for crafting web armor (which is as tough as hide or leather), while a group of workers might be tasked to dig pit traps and cover them with fragile webbing disguised with loose dirt to appear as a solid surface.": "Chitines类似于蜘蛛，但它们的行为更像蚂蚁等社会性昆虫。它们被分为工人和战士两个等级；当出现Choldriths时，它们占据了一个蚁群等级制度的最高级别。每只甲壳虫都有一个社会地位，并承担与该等级有关的职责，而且所有甲壳虫都要牺牲自己来保护蚁群的甲壳虫。每只奇岩怪都有喷丝头，并慢慢地产生网状物，用来建造地板、墙壁、结构、物体和陷阱，以利于蚁群。一个战士可能负责制作网状盔甲（它像皮或皮革一样坚硬），而一群工人可能负责挖掘坑道陷阱，并用脆弱的网状物覆盖它们，用松散的泥土伪装成坚实的表面。",

They lurk in these spots, silent and unseen, waiting for prey to happen by.": "窒息者有软骨而不是骨质骨架。这种灵活的内部结构使它们能够很容易地滑入洞穴家园墙壁上的狭窄裂缝和壁龛。它们潜伏在这些地方，无声无息，不为人知，等待着猎物的到来。",
	"A choker's usual method for luring prey involves positioning the body of its latest catch just outside its hiding spot. Whenever it gets hungry, it tears off a few chunks of flesh to feed itself. In the meantime, the corpse serves to entice other curious folk—explorers from the surface world, drow, duergar, or the choker's favorite prey, goblins—to come within reach.": "窒息者引诱猎物的通常方法是将最新捕获的猎物的身体放在其藏身之处的外面。每当它感到饥饿时，它就撕下几块肉来喂自己。同时，这具尸体还可以引诱其他好奇的民间人士--来自地表世界的探险家、乌鸦、杜尔加人，或者窒息者最喜欢的猎物--哥布林--来到身边。",
	"When a target presents itself, the choker's starfish-shaped hands dart out of its hiding spot, wrap around the victim's throat, and pin the unfortunate creature against the cavern wall. Because its arms are so long, the choker can keep its body deep inside the crevice where it hides, beyond the reach of most normal weapons.": "当目标出现时，窒息者的海星形手就会从它的藏身之处跳出来，缠住受害者的喉咙，并把这个不幸的生物钉在洞穴的墙上。因为它的手臂非常长，所以窒息者可以把它的身体藏在缝隙深处，超出大多数普通武器的范围。",
	"Chokers tend to set their ambushes alone, rather than working in concert, but where one choker is found, others are likely to be nearby. They communicate through eerie, keening howls that travel long distances through caves and tunnels but are difficult to identify or locate in a typical echo-filled cavern.": "窒息者倾向于单独设伏，而不是协同工作，但只要发现一个窒息者，其他窒息者就可能在附近。它们通过阴森恐怖的尖锐嚎叫进行交流，这种嚎叫可以在洞穴和隧道中传播很远的距离，但在一个典型的充满回声的洞穴中很难识别或定位。",
	"Choldriths are monstrous spiderlike creatures originally created to serve Lolth. They rule colonies of chitines (in this book) and lead them into battle in Lolth's war against her enemies.": "Choldriths是畸形的蜘蛛状生物，最初被创造出来为Lolth服务。他们统治着chitines的殖民地（在本书中），并在Lolth对她的敌人的战争中带领他们参加战斗。",
	"When devotees of Lolth created the first chitines, she watched as her followers used arcane magic and demonic powers and invoked her aid for the divine spark needed to ensure the subjects' survival, expecting to see these new abominations dedicated solely to her, but the devotees performed no such ritual. As revenge for the devotees' betrayal, the Spider Queen manipulated the creation rituals so that they sometimes created choldriths instead of chitines.": "当Lolth的信徒创造出第一批chitines时，她看着她的追随者使用奥秘的魔法和恶魔的力量，并祈求她的帮助，以获得确保主体生存所需的神圣火花，期望看到这些新的憎恶只献给她，但信徒们没有进行这样的仪式。作为对信徒背叛的报复，蜘蛛女王操纵了创造仪式，使他们有时创造出choldriths而不是chitines。",
	"At first, these devotees were unaware that the new creatures, which they dubbed choldriths, were signs of Lolth's wrath. Instead, they were pleased, because choldriths could lay eggs that birthed more chitines (and the rare choldrith) and could direct the chitines in their work. But the devotees soon realized their mistake—choldriths belonged to Lolth, body and soul. Choldriths whispered to the chitines of their adoration of the Spider Queen and their enmity against their creators, and led them in a successful revolt.": "起初，这些信徒并不知道这些被他们称为choldriths的新生物是Lolth的愤怒的标志。相反，他们很高兴，因为choldriths可以下蛋，孕育出更多的chitines（和罕见的choldrith），并可以指导chitines工作。但信徒们很快意识到他们的错误--Choldriths属于Lolth，身体和灵魂。Choldriths悄悄告诉chitines他们对蜘蛛女王的崇拜和对他们的创造者的敌意，并带领他们成功起义。",
	"Choldriths are born with a mystical connection to Lolth, which gives them divine magic. They also make up the ruling caste of most chitine colonies. A colony can support numerous choldriths, who serve as commanders, priests, and supervisors. The choldriths continually jockey for position, although they rarely confront one another in a way that puts the colony at risk. The colony is ruled by a sovereign, who determines which colony members perform which tasks, including whether a choldrith is permitted to lay eggs. Sometimes a choldrith ruler receives a vision from Lolth that inspires the entire colony into some grand, often violent, action.": "Choldriths生来就与Lolth有着神秘的联系，这让他们拥有神圣的魔法。他们也构成了大多数奇丁殖民地的统治阶层。一个殖民地可以养活许多choldriths，他们担任指挥官、祭司和监督员。Choldriths不断地争夺地位，尽管他们很少以使殖民地面临危险的方式相互对抗。殖民地由一位君主统治，他决定哪些殖民地成员执行哪些任务，包括是否允许choldrith下蛋。有时，一个choldrith统治者会收到来自Lolth的愿景，激励整个殖民地采取一些宏伟的、往往是暴力的行动。",
	"A bronze scout seldom emerges from underground. Its telescoping eyestalks observe foes at close range while most of its segmented body remains buried.

The rats invade communities and act as eyes and ears for the colony's elder brain, transmitting their thoughts when they swarm and are within range of the elder brain's telepathy.": "一只颅鼠用它的自然心灵感应来交流饥饿、恐惧和其他基本情绪。一群颅骨鼠通过心灵感应 \"说话\"，就像一个生物一样，经常使用集体代词 \"我们 \"和 \"我们 \"来称呼自己。一些掠夺者殖民地使用颅骨鼠作为间谍。这些老鼠入侵社区，充当殖民地长老大脑的眼睛和耳朵，当它们成群结队并在长老大脑的心灵感应范围内时，会传递它们的想法。",
	"The Summer Queen's curse causes a darkling's body to absorb light, which wizens the creature, much like the effect of rapid aging. For this reason, darklings cover their entire bodies with clothing when exposure to light is a risk. The light darklings absorb over the course of their lives explodes outward when they die, incinerating the creatures and much of their possessions.": "夏日女王的诅咒使黑灵的身体吸收光线，这使生物变得更加聪明，很像快速老化的效果。出于这个原因，当暴露在光线下有风险时，黑暗精灵会用衣服遮盖住整个身体。黑人在一生中吸收的光线在他们死亡时向外爆发，焚烧生物和他们的大部分财产。",
	"A wise and respected darkling can undergo a ritual to become an elder. Other elders mark the supplicant with glowing tattoos, channeling away some of the darkling's absorbed light. If the ritual succeeds, the darkling grows into a taller, elf-like form. The darkling perishes if the ritual fails.": "一个聪明的、受人尊敬的黑暗精灵可以通过一个仪式成为长老。其他长老用发光的纹身给祈求者做记号，把黑灵吸收的一些光引走。如果仪式成功，黑灵就会长成一个更高的、类似精灵的形状。如果仪式失败，黑灵就会灭亡。",
	"Ancient legends speak of a seelie fey who betrayed the Summer Queen. In the Summer Queens' wrath, she cursed every member of his house.

From such enclaves, they quietly ply their trade as thieves and assassins.": "古老的传说中，有一个背叛了夏日女王的塞利族人。在夏日女王的愤怒下，她诅咒了他家的每一个成员。这个精灵族人的真名已被从历史中抹去，但故事中称他为Dubh Catha（\"黑暗乌鸦\"），而其他精灵族人将这个家族的后裔称为dubh sith--\"黑暗精灵\"。黑暗人居住在其他物种的城镇下面隐蔽的洞穴和房间里。在这样的飞地里，他们悄悄地做着小偷和刺客的生意。",
	"A death kiss is a lesser beholder that can come into being when a true beholder has a vivid nightmare about losing blood. Its coloration and shape resemble those of the beholder that dreamed it into existence, but its hue is more muted, and instead of magical eye rays, it has ten long tentacles, each ending in a mouth full of teeth. It can speak through any of its tentacle-maws in a high-pitched, nasal voice.": "死亡之吻是一种较小的生命体，当一个真正的生命体做了一个关于失血的生动的噩梦时，就会出现。它的颜色和形状与梦到它存在的持灵者相似，但它的色调更加柔和，而且它没有神奇的眼睛射线，而是有十条长长的触手，每条触手的末端都有一张充满牙齿的嘴。它可以通过它的任何一个触手--爪子以高亢的鼻音说话。",
	"Death kisses fear true beholders, which can easily kill or subdue them. Lacking the egotism of their stronger kin, a death kiss usually submits to the rule of its creator or any other beholder it encounters, but it tries to escape as soon as the beholder is preoccupied.": "死亡之吻害怕真正的看客，因为看客可以轻易地杀死或制服它们。由于缺乏它们更强大的亲属的利己主义，死亡之吻通常服从于它的创造者或它遇到的任何其他看守者的统治，但一旦看守者心事重重，它就会试图逃跑。",
	"A death kiss consumes ingested blood, which it also uses to heal and generate electrical energy inside its body. Terrified of dying from starvation, it obsessively drains even little creatures such as rats, leaving behind a trail of bloodless corpses.

Above ground, it usually keeps its tentacles retracted when on the hunt, then lashes out with them to catch opponents off guard.": "死亡之吻消耗摄入的血液，它也用这些血液来治疗和在体内产生电能。由于害怕死于饥饿，它甚至痴迷地吸食小动物，如老鼠，留下一串无血的尸体。在地下时，它用触角作为感觉器，探查和检查各个方向的环境。在地面上，它在捕猎时通常将触手缩回，然后用触手抽打对手，使其猝不及防。",
	"A death kiss lacks the combat finesse and intelligence of a true beholder. In most cases, it simply latches on to its prey with one or more of its tentacles and drains blood until the prey collapses. If it's in a superior position and its foe poses no threat, it might toy with its food, drawing out its prey's death. A death kiss prefers to hunt alone. If it meets another of its kind, it might fight, flee, or team up, depending on its health and pride.": "死亡之吻缺乏真正意义上的战斗技巧和智慧。在大多数情况下，它只是用一条或多条触手抓住猎物，吸干血液，直到猎物倒下。如果它处于优势地位，而且它的敌人不构成威胁，它可能会玩弄它的食物，引出猎物的死亡。死亡之吻更喜欢单独狩猎。如果它遇到另一个同类，它可能会根据自己的健康状况和自尊心，进行战斗、逃亡或合作。",
	"An overpowering urge to serve consumes the mind of a newly awakened deathlock.

To accomplish a difficult goal, the deathlock might be forced to serve another powerful creature or might need to gather servants of its own.": "无论目标是什么，它总是反映出赞助人的兴趣，从小规模的关注到宇宙范围的事务。一个受恶魔控制的死锁可能会努力摧毁一个供奉善神的特定寺庙，而一个为伟大的老者服务的死锁可能会寻找必要的材料来召唤一个可怕的实体进入这个世界。为了完成一个困难的目标，死锁可能被迫为另一个强大的生物服务，或者需要召集自己的仆人。",
	"Though deathlocks exist to serve their patrons, they retain some freedom when it comes to devising tactics and carrying out plans.

In any case, it is the deep scion's duty to infiltrate the air-breathing world and report back to their master. When set to this task, a deep scion worms their way into the life of an unsuspecting enemy as a new friend, a lover, the perfect candidate for a job, or some other role that enables the minion to carry out their master's commands.": "一个深海子孙从深海中出现，为他们的水下主人服务，这个主人可能是克拉肯或其他深海中的古老生物。在戴上他们曾经的身心作为一种面具的同时，这种生物一心想要满足他们主人的欲望。有时，深渊子孙会回到他们以前的家--在所有希望都破灭的时候被意外地发现还活着。在其他时候，深渊子孙会有一个新的身份。在任何情况下，潜入呼吸空气的世界并向他们的主人报告，是深渊子孙的职责。当被设定为这项任务时，深渊子孙会以新朋友、情人、工作的最佳人选，或其他能够使奴才执行主人命令的角色，蠕动进入毫无戒心的敌人的生活。",
	"The training to which a deep scion is subjected rids it of empathy for those they spy on. Though a deep scion might behave as though infatuated, laugh at the joke of a friend, or appear incensed at some injustice, each of these acts is artificial to the deep scion, a means to an end. The creature believes that their true form is the shape they take when they return to the sea they think of as home. Ironically, however, a deep scion that is killed when in their piscine form is stripped of the magic that enabled them to transform, leaving behind the corpse of the person the deep scion once was.": "深度间谍所受的训练使其对他们所监视的人失去了同情心。尽管深海龙卷风可能表现得很迷恋，对朋友的玩笑大笑，或对某些不公正的事情表现得很愤怒，但这些行为对深海龙卷风来说都是人为的，是达到目的的一种手段。这种生物认为，他们的真实形态是他们回到他们认为是家的海洋时的形态。然而具有讽刺意味的是，当深海龙卷风的形态被杀死时，使他们能够变身的魔法就被剥夺了，留下的是深海龙卷风曾经的尸体。",

The creation prompts the leaders of the house to begin crafting new plans to strike at its rivals when the draegloth is fully grown.

Most draegloths fiercely resent being given orders, but thanks to their training, they typically take out their frustration on their creator's enemies, rather than on their creator.

	"Among Lolth's devotees in the city of Menzoberranzan in the Forgotten Realms, each noble house entrusts the leadership of its military forces to a house captain, who is typically the first or second son of a drow matron mother. Elsewhere drow house captains fight in the war against Lolth, often allying with duergar and others who also wish to rid their subterranean world of that god's malevolence.": "在被遗忘的领域中的门索贝兰赞城的洛尔思信徒中，每个贵族家族都将其军事力量的领导权委托给一个家族队长，他通常是乌鸦母亲的第一个或第二个儿子。在其他地方，乌鸦家族的队长们参加了对抗洛尔思的战争，他们经常与杜尔加和其他同样希望在地下世界摆脱该神的恶毒的人结盟。",
	"Lolth's worshipers expect treachery—the Spider Queen encourages it, after all. A certain amount of backstabbing and double-crossing can be managed, but too much can undermine an entire community. To keep some semblance of order and to root out traitors, priestesses of Lolth employ inquisitors. Inquisitors are chosen from the ranks of the priesthood, and their authority is equaled only by that of the {@creature drow matron mother|MPMM|drow matron mothers} (also in this book) of the noble houses. Anyone they decide is at odds with the hierarchy faces painful interrogation and usually an excruciating death.": "Lolth的崇拜者期待背叛，毕竟蜘蛛女王鼓励背叛。一定程度的背信弃义和两面三刀是可以处理的，但过多的背信弃义会破坏整个社区。为了保持一定的秩序并铲除叛徒，洛尔思的女祭司们雇佣了审问者。审问者是从神职人员中挑选出来的，他们的权力只有贵族之家的{@creature drow matron mother|MPMM|drow matron mothers}（也在本书中）的权力可以比拟。任何被他们认定为与等级制度相抵触的人都会面临痛苦的审讯，通常会被折磨致死。",
	"Among drow followers of {@deity Lolth|Drow|MTF}, each noble house is led by a matron mother, an influential priestess of Lolth charged with carrying out the god's will while also advancing the interests of the family. Matron mothers embody the scheming and treachery associated with the Queen of Spiders. Each stands at the center of a vast conspiratorial web, with demons, spiders, and conscripted soldiers positioned between them and their enemies. Although matron mothers command great power, that power depends on maintaining the Spider Queen's favor, and the goddess sometimes capriciously takes back what she has given. The stat block here represents a matron mother at the height of her power.": "在{@deity Lolth|Drow|MTF}的鸦人信徒中，每个贵族家族都由一位母后领导，她是一位有影响力的洛尔思女祭司，负责执行神的旨意，同时也促进家族的利益。母后体现了与蜘蛛女王有关的阴谋和背叛。每个人都站在一个巨大的阴谋网的中心，恶魔、蜘蛛和被征召的士兵被安排在他们和敌人之间。尽管女修道院院长拥有巨大的权力，但这种权力取决于能否保持蜘蛛女王的青睐，而女神有时会任性地收回她所给予的东西。这里的数据块代表了一位处于权力巅峰的女院长。",

They protect enclaves and Underdark cities from enemies and track down thieves who make off with prized treasures. In the city of Menzoberranzan in the Forgotten Realms, noble houses often employ shadowblades to eliminate rivals from other houses.

	"Most likely because those servants would excel at herding their masters' other minions. In retrospect, it seems arguable that duergar escaped bondage because their jailers had given them the keys.": "最有可能的原因是，这些仆人擅长驱赶他们主人的其他奴仆。回过头来看，似乎可以说，杜尔加逃脱了束缚，因为他们的狱卒给了他们钥匙。",
	"Duergar are dwarves of the deep reaches of the Underdark and other sunless realms. Their personalities and abilities have been deeply impacted by their ancestors' captivity and torment by mind flayers; they were infused with powerful psionic abilities but also a profound gloom. In some, this strain of sorrow inspires works of grand but melancholic beauty, while in others, it manifests as rage.": "杜尔加（Duergar）是来自暗黑世界深处和其他无日王国的矮人。他们的个性和能力受到了他们的祖先被心灵驱逐者囚禁和折磨的深刻影响；他们被注入了强大的幻觉能力，但也有一种深刻的阴郁。在一些人身上，这种悲伤的情绪激发了宏伟而忧郁的作品，而在另一些人身上，它表现为愤怒。",
	"Like many who dwell in the Underdark, duergar must constantly be on guard against the raids and plots of their neighbors.

	"Denigrated by some as joyless, duergar are in fact deeply passionate in all that they do—even if that passion rarely manifests as mirth. They bring an emotional intensity to their lives, whether they're exploring neighboring tunnels, defending their homes, engaging with their families, or crafting bold new works. The bonds of friendship and kinship are strong, though navigating the inevitable outbursts of frustration and despair is not always easy. Similarly, duergar tend to be very community-minded—in the Underdark, all must cooperate to survive.": "被一些人诋毁为毫无乐趣，但事实上，杜尔加人对他们所做的一切都充满了激情，即使这种激情很少表现为欢笑。他们为自己的生活带来了强烈的情感，无论他们是在探索邻近的隧道、保卫家园、与家人交往，还是在制作大胆的新作品。友谊和亲情的纽带是强大的，尽管驾驭不可避免的沮丧和绝望的爆发并不总是容易的。同样，杜尔加人往往非常有社区意识--在地下城，所有人都必须合作才能生存。",
	"Among the duergar of the Forgotten Realms, creation is a fiercely passionate process. They tend to favor works that are sturdy and grand, but in a bare, stripped-down fashion that favors geometric forms. The strongholds they design are blocky and stark, and the weapons they forge are blatantly tools of violence. While others may decry their creations as cold and bare of ornamentation to the point of austerity, duergar see them as honoring the materials used and honest about their purpose.": "在被遗忘的领域中的duergar中，创作是一个充满激情的过程。他们倾向于选择坚固而宏伟的作品，但以一种赤裸裸的、脱胎换骨的方式，倾向于几何形式。他们设计的堡垒是块状的、呆板的，而他们锻造的武器是公然的暴力工具。其他人可能会指责他们的作品冷酷无情，没有任何装饰，甚至到了紧缩的地步，而Duergar则认为它们是对所用材料的尊重，对其目的的诚实。",
	"Creative duergar engineers have built numerous war machines, including some that can be fused with a duergar.

It learns to hide its enormous body in murky pools, keeping only its eyestalk above water to watch for passing creatures.

A froghemoth can be tamed (after a fashion) by offering it food, and bullywugs can communicate with it on a basic level, so the creature might eat only a few bullywugs before following the rest. The bullywugs gather food as tribute for it, provide it with a comfortable lair, protect it from harm, and try to ensure that any of its offspring reach maturity.": "如果{@creature bullywug||bullywugs}遇到了青蛙巨兽，恶霸们可能会把青蛙巨兽当作神，并尽其所能把怪物哄骗到他们的巢穴里。蛙人可以通过向它提供食物来驯服它（在某种程度上），恶霸武者可以与它进行基本的交流，所以这个怪物可能只吃几个恶霸武者，然后就跟着其他的人走。霸王龙收集食物作为对它的贡品，为它提供一个舒适的巢穴，保护它免受伤害，并努力确保它的任何后代都能达到成熟。",

If a frost giant comes to relish these dreams and nightmares, as some do, Vaprak sets a troll upon a sacred quest to find the frost giant and meet the giant in secret. The troll offers up its own body to be devoured in Vaprak's name. Only the boldest and most determined frost giants can finish such a gory feast.": "瓦普拉克是一个凶猛的力量和饥饿之神，也被一些食人魔和巨魔所崇拜。他喜欢用荣耀的梦想来诱惑冰霜巨人，然后是血腥的食人恶梦。那些不畏惧这种幻觉或向特里姆祭司报告的人，会得到更多同样的东西。如果一个冰霜巨人像某些人一样喜欢这些梦境和噩梦，瓦普拉克就会让一个巨魔进行神圣的探索，去寻找冰霜巨人并与巨人秘密会面。巨魔献出自己的身体，以瓦普拉克的名义被吞噬。只有最勇敢、最坚定的冰霜巨人才能完成这样一场血淋淋的盛宴。",
	"After devouring the troll sent by Vaprak, bones and all, a frost giant becomes an everlasting one, gaining tremendous strength, an ill temper, and a troll's regenerative ability.

The touch of Vaprak can no longer be hidden then, and the everlasting one is either killed or exiled by their clan. Sometimes small communities of everlasting ones gather and even reproduce, passing the \"blessing\" and worship of Vaprak from one generation to the next.": "在吞噬了瓦普拉克派来的巨魔，包括骨头和所有的东西之后，冰霜巨人成为了一个永恒的巨人，获得了巨大的力量、坏脾气和巨魔的再生能力。有了这些天赋，冰霜巨人可以迅速获得伯爵的头衔，并在几十年内轻松抵御对手。然而，如果冰霜巨人没有给瓦普拉克足够的荣誉，或者没有听从瓦普拉克的预言，那么冰霜巨人受到的伤害就会错误地愈合，导致皮肤变色；出现疣状疤痕；以及身体的残余部分，如额外的数字、四肢，甚至是头。这时，Vaprak的触觉就无法再被掩盖了，而长生者要么被杀，要么被他们的家族流放。有时，小规模的永生者聚集在一起，甚至繁殖，将 \"祝福 \"和对Vaprak的崇拜从一代传到另一代。",

	"Although frost salamanders can burrow their way through loose soil, they prefer to dig into ice. They roll around in piles of broken chunks of ice, allowing it to scratch their backs as they grind it down. This habit leads them to create extensive networks of ice caves, which become ever larger as they claw fresh chunks of ice from the walls of their lairs.": "虽然霜螈可以在松散的土壤中钻来钻去，但它们更喜欢挖冰。它们在成堆的破碎冰块中打滚，在磨碎冰块时让冰块划伤它们的背部。这种习惯使它们创造了广泛的冰洞网络，当它们从巢穴的墙壁上抓取新的冰块时，冰洞变得越来越大。",

	"Witherlings travel with their comrades and try to kill anything in their path. They don't eat and aren't motivated by hunger, leaving more flesh for the rest of the war band.": "威瑟林与他们的战友一起旅行，并试图杀死他们路上的任何东西。他们不吃东西，也不受饥饿的驱使，为战队的其他成员留下更多的肉体。",
	"The first gnolls were hyenas transformed by magic. Many of them were then corrupted by the demon lord Yeenoghu. Whether in service to Yeenoghu or dedicated to the survival of their kin, gnoll war bands seek to soften up foes with surprise attacks and to leave no survivors alive.": "第一批地精是由魔法改造的鬣狗。他们中的许多人后来被恶魔领主Yeenoghu腐蚀了。无论是为耶诺古服务，还是致力于其亲属的生存，地精战队都试图通过突袭来软化敌人，并且不留活口。",

Once it forms a bond, a gray render serves its master devotedly.": "灰羚羊的繁殖方式是在它们的身体上形成结节，这些结节在达到成熟的时候会断裂，开始作为年轻的灰羚羊生活。它们对自己的孩子没有义务感，也没有与其他同类聚集的倾向。相反，每个人都有一种强烈的需求，要与一个聪明的生物结合。当它遇到一个合适的主人时，它就会向那个生物唱歌--一种奇怪的鸣叫声，伴随着对土地的抓挠和表示敬意的动作。一旦形成纽带，灰鼠就会全心全意地为其主人服务。",
	"A gray render might be a strong ally, but it's always an unpredictable one.

They then spread throughout the multiverse, with many of them ending up on the worlds of the Material Plane. Most goblinoids encountered on those worlds are members of families that have been away from the Feywild for centuries, and over time, those lineages have become Humanoid. Fey goblinoids, who still bear the magic of the Feywild, are rare on the Material Plane but not unheard of.

	"Iron shadows are hobgoblin martial artists who serve fey and mortal courts as secret police, scouts, and assassins.

When howlers go on the prowl, courage isn't enough to stand up against them.": "在看到嚎叫声之前，先有一声遥远的哀号。即使在远处，听众也会被这种声音吓到，并在意识到这种声音正在接近时充满恐惧。当嚎叫者四处游荡时，勇气不足以抵御它们。",

Howler packs course over the battlefields of the Blood War and also serve evil mortals powerful and vicious enough to command their loyalty.": "这些噩梦般的生物原产于潘德蒙，但在下层世界的大部分地方都能找到它们，它们在那里被训练成战争猎犬。嚎叫者在某种程度上可以被驯化，但它们只对残酷的训练有反应，在训练中它们被迫承认训练者是族群无可争议的领袖。一个训练有素的狼群会毫不犹豫地追随它的领袖。咆哮者群在血战的战场上穿梭，也为强大而邪恶的凡人服务，足以指挥他们的忠诚。",
	"Howlers rely on speed, numbers, and their mind-numbing howling to corner prey before they tear it apart. Their howls flood the minds of their victims, making complex thought impossible.

	"Outside the Nine Hells, Hutijin is a relatively obscure figure, known only to the most learned infernal scholars. He has no cults of his own, and his servants are few in number.

	"Mephistopheles forbids Hutijin from making too many forays into the Material Plane, since the duke's absence leaves him vulnerable to his rivals. Other archdevils know how much Hutijin despises mortals and have secretly disseminated the means to call him from the Nine Hells in the hope of distracting the archdevil long enough for them to assail Mephistopheles. Hutijin sends devils into the Material Plane to eradicate mention of his name and destroy those who have learned of him, but the summonings still occur. When called from his post, he negotiates as quickly as he can, usually closing a deal with little cost to the summoner. However, once the deal has been fulfilled, Hutijin repays the interruption with death.": "梅菲斯特禁止胡提金过多地进入物质世界，因为公爵的缺席使他容易受到对手的攻击。其他大恶魔知道胡提金有多鄙视凡人，并秘密传播了从九层地狱召唤他的方法，希望能分散大恶魔的注意力，让他们有足够的时间去攻击梅菲斯特。胡提金派遣魔鬼进入物质世界，以消除对他名字的提及，并摧毁那些了解他的人，但召唤仍然发生。当被从他的岗位上召唤出来时，他尽可能快地进行谈判，通常在召唤者付出很少代价的情况下完成交易。然而，一旦交易完成，胡提金就会用死亡来偿还中断的交易。",
	"Like the thought-stealing waters of the River Styx they inhabit, hydroloths filch the memories of creatures they attack, stealing away thoughts for delivery to whatever master they happen to serve.

Ki-rins that serve good deities go wherever they are commanded; a ki-rin from an Upper Plane might venture to the Material Plane on a mission, usually as a scout, a messenger, or a spy. A ki-rin living on the Material Plane claims a territory to watch over, and one ki-rin might safeguard an area that encompasses several nations.": "麒麟被对勇气、忠诚、无私和真理的神灵的崇拜所吸引，同时也被正义社会的进步所吸引。例如，在被遗忘的国度里，麒麟大部分都会聚集在托尔姆身边，尽管他们也为他的盟友泰尔和伊尔马特服务。为好的神灵服务的麒麟会去他们被命令的地方；一个来自上层世界的麒麟可能会冒险去物质世界执行任务，通常是作为侦察员、信使或间谍。生活在物质界的麒麟会要求自己的领地，一个麒麟可能会保护一个包括几个国家在内的地区。",
	"On the celestial planes, ki-rins reside in lofty, elegant aeries filled with luxurious objects. On the Material Plane, a ki-rin chooses a similar location for its lair, such as atop a tall pinnacle or within a cloud solidified by the ki-rin's magic. The chosen location is almost always hard to reach, and only those mortals who have the tenacity to complete the daunting journey to a ki-rin's lair can prove themselves worthy of speaking with its occupant. Many of those who do end up pledging service to the creature. They study under its tutelage in its lair and serve as its agents in the world. These followers might travel incognito across the land, seeking news of growing evil and working behind the scenes, or they might be champions of their master's cause, out to defeat villainy wherever it is found.": "在天界，麒麟居住在崇高的、优雅的、充满奢华物品的房间里。在物质界，麒麟会选择一个类似的地点作为它的巢穴，比如在一个高大的山峰上，或者在由麒麟的魔法凝固的云中。所选择的地点几乎总是难以到达，只有那些有毅力完成前往麒麟巢穴的艰巨旅程的凡人才能证明自己有资格与巢穴的主人交谈。许多人最终承诺为该生物服务。他们在麒麟的巢穴里接受它的指导，并在这个世界上充当它的代理人。这些追随者可能会隐姓埋名地在各地旅行，寻找日益增长的邪恶的消息并在幕后工作，或者他们可能是他们主人的事业的拥护者，在任何地方击败恶棍。",
	"When viewed from the outside, a ki-rin's lair is indistinguishable from a natural site, and the entrance is difficult for visitors to find and reach. Inside, the lair is a serene and comfortable place, its ambiance a mix between palace and temple. If the ki-rin has taken creatures into its service, its lair doubles as a sacred site wherein the ki-rin not only rests but also teaches of holy mysteries.": "从外面看，麒麟的巢穴与自然遗址没有区别，而且游客很难找到和到达入口。在里面，巢穴是一个宁静而舒适的地方，其氛围是宫殿和寺庙的混合。如果麒麟将生物纳入其服务范围，它的巢穴就会成为一个神圣的场所，麒麟不仅在这里休息，而且还教授神圣的奥秘。",
	"Believe it or not, I like kobolds. I find their oscillation between bravery an cowardice endlessly entertaining. In fact,I'd say kobolds are proof of the universe's most fundamental lesson: there is always something bigger than you.": "信不信由你，我喜欢哥布林。我发现他们在勇敢和懦弱之间的摇摆无休止地令人愉快。事实上，我认为哥布林是宇宙最基本的教训的证明：总有一些东西比你更大。",
	"Kobold dragonshields are champions of their people. Almost all dragonshields begin life as normal kobolds, then are chosen by a dragon and invested with power for the purpose of protecting the dragon's eggs, but once every few years a kobold hatches with an innate version of the dragonshield's abilities. In either case, a dragonshield is skilled at hand-to-hand combat and bears a shield made of dragon scales, as well as scars from desperate fights.": "哥布林龙盾是他们民族的冠军。几乎所有的龙盾开始时都是普通的哥布林，然后被龙选中，并被赋予保护龙蛋的力量，但每隔几年就会有一个哥布林孵化出具有龙盾能力的天生版本。无论哪种情况，龙盾都擅长徒手搏斗，并拥有龙鳞制成的盾牌，以及拼命搏斗留下的伤痕。",
	"Dragonshields know they have a place of honor among those who venerate dragons, but—being kobolds at heart—most of them feel unworthy of their status and are desperate to prove themselves deserving of it. But they also have the ability to rally in the face of certain death, inspiring others to follow them into battle.": "龙骑士知道他们在那些崇尚龙的人中有一席之地，但作为内心深处的哥布林，他们中的大多数人都觉得自己的地位不值一提，并急于证明自己配得上这个地位。但他们也有能力在面对死亡时团结起来，激励其他人跟随他们进入战斗。",
	"A kobold inventor builds improvised weapons to gain an advantage in combat. These weapons last for only one or two attacks before they break and typically work only for the inventor, but they might be surprisingly effective in the meantime. The weapons don't have to be lethal—often one serves its purpose if it distracts, scares, or confuses a creature long enough for the inventor to kill that foe.": "一个哥布林发明家建造简易的武器以获得战斗中的优势。这些武器在损坏之前只能持续一到两次攻击，而且通常只对发明者有效，但在此期间它们可能会有令人惊讶的效果。这些武器不一定是致命的--通常情况下，如果能分散注意力、吓唬或迷惑一个生物足够长的时间让发明家杀死那个敌人，它就达到了目的。",
	"Kobold scale sorcerers have an innate talent for arcane magic, making them highly valuable members of their communities. These sorcerers typically fill the role of advisor, and when threatened, a scale sorcerer lashes out with colorful magic.": "哥布林鳞片巫师具有与生俱来的奥术天赋，使他们成为社区中非常有价值的成员。这些巫师通常充当顾问的角色，当受到威胁时，鳞片巫师会用丰富多彩的魔法进行抨击。",
	"A scale sorcerer who resides in or near a dragon's lair may serve as that dragon's diplomat and mouthpiece—anticipating the dragon's needs, issuing commands to others on the dragon's behalf, and reporting information back to the dragon. Such scale sorcerers often wear artificial wings, which are a sign of their draconic office. Scale sorcerers are just as awed by and respectful of dragons as others who venerate these mighty creatures, but they know that duty requires them not to fawn over their master at all times. They also understand that their frequent proximity to their dragon master means they would probably be the first to die if their master became angry or displeased, so they frantically maintain a balance between adoration and terror in their behavior toward their master.": "居住在龙的巢穴内或附近的鳞片巫师可以充当龙的外交官和传声筒--预测龙的需求，代表龙向其他人发布命令，并向龙报告信息。这样的鳞片巫师经常戴着人造翅膀，这也是他们龙族职务的标志。鳞片巫师和其他崇尚这些强大生物的人一样，对龙感到敬畏和尊重，但他们知道职责要求他们不能随时向主人献媚。他们也明白，他们经常接近他们的龙主人意味着如果他们的主人生气或不高兴，他们可能会第一个死去，所以他们在对他们的主人的行为中疯狂地保持着崇拜和恐怖之间的平衡。",
	"Korreds are unpredictable, secretive Fey with strong ties to earth and stone. Because of their magical hair and mystical understanding of minerals, they are sought after by treasure-hunting dwarves and others who desire wealth beneath the earth.": "科瑞德是不可预知的、神秘的费伊人，与大地和石头有着密切的联系。由于他们有神奇的头发和对矿物的神秘理解，他们被寻宝的矮人和其他渴望地底财富的人所追捧。",
	"Korreds can hurl boulders far larger than it seems they should be able to, shape stone as though it were clay, and swim through rock. They also gain supernatural strength just from standing on the ground.": "科瑞德可以投掷远比他们看起来应该能够投掷的更大的巨石，把石头塑造成像粘土一样的形状，并在岩石中游泳。他们还可以通过站在地上获得超自然的力量。",
	"Korreds have hair all over their bodies, but the hair that grows from their heads is magical. When cut, it transforms into whatever material was used to cut it. Korreds use iron shears to cut lengths of this magical hair, then twist the strands together to create iron ropes that they can manipulate, animating them to bind or snake around creatures and objects. Korreds take great pride in their hair and equally great offense at anyone who attempts to cut it without permission.": "Korreds全身都有毛发，但从他们头上长出的毛发是神奇的。当被剪断时，它就会转化为用于剪断的任何材料。科瑞德人用铁剪剪下这种神奇的头发，然后将其捻在一起，形成他们可以操纵的铁绳，使其成为束缚生物和物体的灵动绳索。科瑞德人对自己的头发感到非常自豪，对任何试图未经许可而剪掉头发的人也同样感到非常不爽。",
	"A kraken can seem godlike to folk who have faced its fury. Those who mistake its might for divine power and those who seek to appease the monster through veneration are sometimes rewarded with power, to serve thereafter as kraken priests.": "对那些面对它的愤怒的人来说，克拉肯似乎像神一样。那些把它的威力误认为是神力的人，以及那些试图通过崇拜来安抚怪物的人，有时会得到力量的回报，此后作为克拉肯的祭司来服务。",
	"Every kraken priest undergoes a change in appearance that reflects the kraken's influence, although each one differs in how their reverence is displayed. One kraken priest might have ink-black eyes and a suckered tentacle for a tongue, while another has a featureless face and a body covered in eyes and mouths that dribble seawater. These horrific manifestations intensify when the kraken possesses its minion to utter dire pronouncements.": "每个海怪祭司的外表都会发生变化，反映出海怪的影响，尽管每个人的敬畏之心表现得不一样。一个海怪祭司可能有一双墨黑的眼睛和一条被吸住的触手作为舌头，而另一个则有一张没有特征的脸和一个布满眼睛和嘴巴的身体，会滴下海水。当克拉肯附身在其奴仆身上发出可怕的宣告时，这些可怕的表现会更加强烈。",
	"A hive lord rules each kruthik hive. When the hive lord dies, the surviving members of the hive abandon their lair and search for a new one. When a suitable location is found, the largest kruthik in the hive undergoes a metamorphosis, forming a cocoon around itself and emerging several weeks later as a hive lord—a bigger and smarter kruthik with the ability to spray digestive acid from its maw. The hive lord claims the largest chamber of the lair and keeps several adult kruthiks nearby as bodyguards.": "一个蜂巢领主统治着每一个克鲁斯克蜂巢。当蜂巢领主死亡时，幸存的蜂巢成员会放弃他们的巢穴，寻找新的巢穴。当找到一个合适的地点时，蜂巢中最大的kruthik就会发生蜕变，在自己周围形成一个茧，几周后出现，成为蜂巢领主--一个更大、更聪明的kruthik，能够从它的嘴里喷出消化酸。蜂巢领主拥有巢穴中最大的房间，并在附近保留几个成年的克鲁特克作为保镖。",
	"Imagine a hive of ants the size of horses, but the ants are wearing armor.": "想象一下，一窝蚂蚁有马那么大，但蚂蚁们都穿着盔甲。",
	"Other creatures that abide in hives serve a purpose in the natural world. Bees pollinate flowers. Termites make earth out of wood. Kruthiks, by contrast, slay societies.": "住在蜂巢里的其他生物在自然界中也有其作用。蜜蜂为花朵授粉。白蚁用木头造土。相比之下，Kruthiks则杀害社会。",
	"Kruthiks are chitin-covered reptiles that hunt in packs and nest in sprawling subterranean warrens. They are attracted to sources of heat, such as dwarven forges and pools of molten lava, and carve out lairs as close to such locations as possible. As they burrow through the earth, they leave behind tunnels—evidence that is often the first clue to the nearby presence of a kruthik hive. Kruthiks also make use of preexisting underground chambers, incorporating them into their lairs when they can.": "克鲁提克是一种被甲壳素覆盖的爬行动物，它们成群结队地捕食，并在广阔的地下巢穴中筑巢。它们被热源所吸引，比如矮人的锻造炉和熔岩池，并尽可能地在这些地方开辟巢穴。当它们钻进土里时，会留下隧道--这些证据往往是附近存在克虏伯巢穴的第一条线索。克鲁特克人还利用预先存在的地下空间，在可能的情况下将它们纳入自己的巢穴。",
	"Kruthiks communicate with one another through a series of hisses and chittering noises. These sounds can often be heard in advance of a kruthik attack. Whenever their lair is invaded, kruthik guards send out an alarm by rapidly tapping the stone floor with their sharp legs.": "Kruthiks通过一系列的嘶嘶声和抖动的声音相互交流。这些声音经常可以在克虏伯的攻击前听到。每当它们的巢穴被入侵时，克鲁斯克的守卫就会用它们锋利的腿快速敲击石板地面，发出警报。",
	"In addition to having an acute sense of smell, kruthiks can see in the dark and can detect vibrations in the earth around them. They take the scent of their own dead as a warning and avoid areas where many other kruthiks have died. Slaying a sufficient number of kruthiks in one area might cause the remaining hive members to move elsewhere.": "除了具有敏锐的嗅觉外，Kruthiks还能在黑暗中看到东西，并能探测到周围土地的振动。它们把自己死者的气味作为一种警告，并避开许多其他kruthiks已经死亡的地区。在一个地区杀死足够数量的kruthiks可能会导致剩余的蜂巢成员转移到其他地方。",
	"Although they can feed on carrion, kruthiks prefer live prey. They kill enemies by impaling them on their spiked limbs, then grind up the flesh and bones with mandibles strong enough to chew rock. When several kruthiks gang up on a single foe, they become frenzied and even more lethal.": "虽然它们可以以腐肉为食，但克鲁斯克更喜欢活的猎物。它们用带刺的肢体刺死敌人，然后用足以咀嚼岩石的下颚磨碎肉和骨头。当几只克里克联合起来对付一个敌人时，它们会变得狂热，甚至更加致命。",
	"Kruthiks abide the presence of Constructs, Elementals, Oozes, and Undead, and they use such creatures to help guard their hive. They are smart enough to barricade some tunnels and dig new ones that keep their neighbors away from their eggs.": "克鲁特克人厌恶构造物、元素、奥兹和亡灵的存在，他们利用这些生物来帮助守护他们的蜂巢。它们很聪明，可以封锁一些隧道，并挖掘新的隧道，让邻居远离它们的卵。",
	"A leucrotta is what you would get if you took the head of a giant badger, the legs of a deer, and the body of a large hyena, then put them together and reanimated them with demon ichor without bothering to cover up the stink of death.": "如果你把一只大獾的头、一只鹿的腿和一只大鬣狗的身体放在一起，然后用恶魔的汁液使它们复活，而不去掩盖死亡的臭味，那么你就会得到一只leucrotta。",
	"The first leucrottas came into be ing alongside some gnolls during the rampages of Yeenoghu on the Material Plane. While many of the hyenas that ate Yeenoghu's kills transformed into gnolls, others underwent more bizarre changes; leucrottas were the most numerous of these.": "第一批白鼬是在耶诺古在物质世界的横行中与一些地精一起出现的。虽然许多吃了耶诺古所杀的鬣狗都变成了地精，但其他的鬣狗则发生了更多奇怪的变化；白鼬是其中最多的。",
	"As clever as it is cruel, a leucrotta loves to deceive, torture, and kill. Creatures who venerate Yeenoghu—particularly his gnoll followers—view leucrottas with great respect. Although a leucrotta is unlikely to lead a gnoll war band, it can influence the leader and might agree to carry the leader into battle and offer advice during the fight. Followers of Yeenoghu also see leucrottas as a form of entertainment. They enjoy watching a leucrotta work almost as much as they like doing their own killing, since leucrottas are meticulous in their cruelty and able to draw out kills for better and longer sport. And when there are no victims to be had, a leucrotta can mimic the delightful squeals of a suffering victim.": "利古塔既聪明又残忍，它喜欢欺骗、折磨和杀戮。崇尚耶诺古的生物--特别是他的地精追随者--都非常尊重利古塔。虽然利库塔不太可能领导地精的战队，但它可以影响领导者，并可能同意携带领导者上战场，在战斗中提供建议。Yeenoghu的追随者们也将利古塔视为一种娱乐形式。他们喜欢看leucrotta工作，几乎和他们喜欢自己杀人一样，因为leucrotta的残忍程度一丝不苟，能够引出杀戮，以获得更好、更长的运动。当没有受害者的时候，白鼬可以模仿痛苦的受害者发出令人愉快的尖叫声。",
	"A leucrotta is so loathsome that few outside of its own kind can stand to be around one for long. Its horrific, hodgepodge body oozes a foul stench. This reek is outdone only by the creature's breath, which issues from a maw that drips fluid corrupted with rot and digestive juices. In place of fangs, a leucrotta has bony ridges as hard as steel that can crush bones and lacerate flesh. These plates are so tough that a leucrotta can use them to peel plate armor away from the body of a slain knight.": "蛭子是如此令人厌恶，以至于除了它的同类之外，很少有人能忍受在它身边待很长时间。它那可怕的、大杂烩式的身体渗出了一股恶臭。这种恶臭仅次于该生物的呼吸，它从一个滴着腐烂的液体和消化液的大嘴中发出。作为獠牙的替代物，白喉有像钢铁一样坚硬的骨脊，可以压碎骨头和撕裂肉体。这些板块是如此坚硬，以至于白喉人可以用它们来剥去被杀骑士身上的板甲。",
	"A leucrotta's stench would normally warn away prey long before the creature could attack. It has two natural capabilities, however, that give it an advantage. First, a leucrotta's tracks are nearly impossible to distinguish from those of common deer. Second, it can duplicate the call or the vocal expressions of just about any creature it has heard. The monster uses its mimicry to lure in potential victims, then attacks while they are confused or unaware of the actual threat.": "通常情况下，白鹦鹉的臭味会在其攻击前很久就警告猎物。然而，它有两个自然能力，使它具有优势。首先，白头翁的足迹几乎不可能与普通鹿的足迹相区别。其次，它可以复制它所听到的几乎所有生物的叫声或声音表达。这种怪物利用其模仿能力来引诱潜在的受害者，然后在他们感到困惑或没有意识到实际威胁的时候进行攻击。",
	"A leviathan is an immense creature that acts as a force of nature, dragging ships down to the ocean's depths and washing away coastal settlements. When called forth, a leviathan arises from a large body of water and takes on the form of a gigantic serpent.": "利维坦是一种巨大的生物，作为一种自然力量，将船只拖到海洋深处，并冲走沿海的定居点。当被召唤出来时，利维坦会从一个大的水体中出现，并呈现出巨大的蛇的形态。",
	"Usually found only on the Elemental Plane of Water, a leviathan sometimes swims through a portal to another world, where tritons, sea elves, and other aquatic folk attempt to contain it. Nihilistic cults have also been known to perform arduous rituals to summon a leviathan to a world, with the aim of using the creature to destroy coastal communities. Those cultists often consider it a blessing to drown themselves in the elemental's waters.": "通常只在水元素界发现，利维坦有时会通过传送门游到另一个世界，在那里，三叶虫、海精灵和其他水生生物试图控制它。虚无主义的邪教也被称为进行艰苦的仪式，将利维坦召唤到一个世界，目的是利用这个生物来摧毁沿海社区。这些崇拜者通常认为将自己淹没在元素的水中是一种祝福。",
	"The sorrow of isolation afflicts many creatures that lurk in the Shadowfell, but the need for companionship is never manifested more dramatically than in the lonely sorrowsworn—also called the Lonely. When these sorrowsworn spot other creatures, they feel keenly the need for interaction and launch their harpoon-like arms to drag their victims closer.": "孤独的悲伤折磨着潜伏在暗影城的许多生物，但对同伴的需求从来没有比孤独的忧伤者--也被称为孤独者--表现得更明显。当这些悲鸣者发现其他生物时，他们会敏锐地感受到互动的需要，并发动他们鱼叉般的手臂将受害者拉近。",
	"The Shadowfell turns visitors around until they become marooned in its twisted landscape. Lost sorrowsworn—often referred to as the Lost—are representations of the anxiety and fear people experience when they can't find their way. These sorrowsworn appear desperate and panicked.": "阴影之城让游客转来转去，直到他们被放逐到其扭曲的景观中。失落的悲伤者--通常被称为失落者--是人们在找不到方向时的焦虑和恐惧的代表。这些悲伤的人看起来很绝望和惊慌。",
	"Lost sorrowsworn grasp at any creatures they can reach. A victim experiences a flood of fear and panic as its mind buckles under the fury of this assault. The harder a victim's allies fight to break the grasp, the more the victim suffers.": "失落的悲哀者会抓住他们所能触及的任何生物。当受害者的头脑在这种攻击的狂暴下崩溃时，他们会体验到恐惧和惊慌的洪水。受害者的盟友越是努力挣扎来打破这种抓捕，受害者就越是痛苦。",
	"Martial arts adepts are disciplined monks with extensive training in hand-to-hand combat. Some protect monasteries; others travel the world seeking enlightenment or new forms of combat to master. A few become bodyguards, trading their combat prowess and loyalty for food and lodging.": "武术专家是经过广泛的徒手格斗训练的有纪律的僧侣。有些人保护寺院；有些人则周游世界，寻求开悟或掌握新的战斗形式。少数人成为保镖，用他们的战斗力和忠诚度换取食物和住宿。",

You may roll on the Martial Arts Adept Tattoos table to determine what sort of tattoo an adept bears.": "有些武术家用纹身来纪念自己的灵感或导师，或者纪念深刻的教训、胜利或失败。你可以在武术专家纹身表上掷骰子来决定专家身上的纹身是什么类型的。",

	"The Hall of Concordance is an embassy of pure law in Sigil, the City of Doors. In the hall, parties who agree to mutual terms—and who pay the requisite gold to the Kolyarut, a mechanical engine of absolute jurisprudence—can have their contract chiseled onto a sheet of gold that is placed in the chest of a marut. From that moment until the contract is fulfilled, the marut is bound to enforce its terms and to punish any party who breaks them. A marut resorts to lethal force only if a contract calls for it, if the contract is fully broken, or if the marut is attacked.": "协约大厅是门之城Sigil的一个纯粹的法律大使馆。在大厅里，同意相互条款的各方--并向绝对法学的机械引擎Kolyarut支付必要的金币--可以将他们的合同凿在一张金纸上，然后放在Marut的胸口。从那一刻起，直到合同履行完毕，Marut有义务执行其条款，并惩罚任何违反条款的一方。只有在合同要求、合同被完全破坏或Marut受到攻击的情况下，Marut才会使用致命的武力。",
	"Inevitables care nothing for the spirit of an agreement, only the letter. A marut enforces what is written, not what was meant by or supposed to be understood from the writing.

These bipeds have the heads and claws of crustaceans, and they primarily live in forests, although they adapt well to urban and subterranean settings.": "Meenlocks是唤起恐怖并试图摧毁所有善良、无辜和美丽的东西的费伊人。这些双足动物拥有甲壳类动物的头部和爪子，它们主要生活在森林中，尽管它们很适应城市和地下环境。",
	"Meenlocks are spawned by fear. When terror overwhelms a creature in the Feywild or another location where the Feywild's influence is strong, one or more meenlocks might spontaneously arise in the shadows or darkness nearby. If more than one meenlock is born, a lair also magically forms. The earth creaks and moans as narrow, twisting tunnels open up within it. One of these passageways serves as the lair's only entrance, and a large central chamber serves as the meenlocks' den. Inside the warren, black moss covers every surface, muffling sound.": "Meenlocks是由恐惧催生的。当恐怖压倒了仙境或其他仙境影响强烈的地方的生物时，一个或多个meenlock可能会在附近的阴影或黑暗中自发产生。如果诞生了一个以上的 \"米恩洛克\"，一个巢穴也会神奇地形成。大地嘎吱嘎吱地呻吟着，狭窄、扭曲的隧道在其中打开。其中一条通道是巢穴的唯一入口，而一个大的中心室则是米诺克斯的巢穴。在巢穴内，黑色的苔藓覆盖了每一个表面，使声音变得很低。",

If the creature is susceptible and remains {@condition incapacitated} for 1 hour, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 10 ({@damage 3d6}) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The save DC is 10 + the number of meenlocks participating in the torment, considering only those that remain within sight of the victim for the entire hour and aren't {@condition incapacitated} during it. The process can be repeated. A Humanoid that drops to 0 hit points as a result of this damage instantly transforms into a meenlock at full health and under the DM's control.

The mindwitness is psychically imprinted with devotion to the elder brain and submission to illithid commands.": "如果一个beholder是{@condition stunned}，并被带到一个长者大脑的盐水池中，这个beholder可以被转化为一个心灵智者。这改变了它的一些眼线，并将它的四条眼线转化为类似于心灵杀手的触角。心灵感应者在精神上被打上了对长老大脑的奉献和对伊利瑟德命令的服从。",
	"A mindwitness's primary function is to improve telepathic communication in a mind flayer colony. A creature in telepathic communication with a mindwitness can converse through it to as many as seven other creatures the mindwitness can see, rapidly disseminating commands and other information.": "心灵智囊的主要功能是改善掠夺者群体中的心灵感应。一个与心灵感应者进行心灵感应的生物可以通过它与心灵感应者能看到的多达七个其他生物进行交流，迅速传播命令和其他信息。",

	"For eons, Moloch ruled his domain, vying against the other archdevils as he sought still greater power. This animosity worked in Asmodeus's favor, since Asmodeus knew that Moloch's scheming helped keep the other archdevils in check. The arrangement unraveled, however, when Moloch took the night hag named Malagard for his advisor. Her poisonous words gradually convinced him to attempt to topple Asmodeus. The conspiracy nearly succeeded, but was ultimately thwarted. Moloch was stripped of his station and sentenced to death—only the timely use of a planar portal allowed him to escape.": "长久以来，魔洛神统治着他的领地，在寻求更大的权力时与其他大恶魔争夺。这种敌意对阿斯莫德有利，因为阿斯莫德知道魔洛神的诡计有助于控制其他大恶魔。然而，当魔洛神把名叫马拉加德的夜行女巫当作他的顾问时，这种安排就解体了。她的毒舌逐渐说服了他试图推翻阿斯莫德的统治。这个阴谋几乎成功了，但最终被挫败了。魔洛神被剥夺了职位，并被判处死刑--只有及时使用平面传送门才使他得以逃脱。",
	"Moloch wasted no time in preparing for his return. He amassed an army of devils and monsters and left them to make final preparations for invading the Nine Hells, while he ventured to the Material Plane in search of an artifact that would ensure his success.

They were destroyed in short order.": "摩洛神没有浪费任何时间来准备他的回归。他集结了一支由魔鬼和怪物组成的军队，让他们为入侵九层地狱做最后的准备，而他则冒险去物质世界寻找一件能确保他成功的神器。但在那里，他被困住了，让他的军队任由他的敌人摆布。他们在短时间内被摧毁。",
	"Moloch was rendered nearly powerless by this failure. He schemes of ways to reclaim his former status, but every time he enters the Nine Hells, he is demoted to an {@creature imp} and can't regain his normal powers until he leaves.

	"Rumors suggest that he can often be found in Sigil, where he bargains with yugoloths to build yet another army with which he might invade Malbolge and wrest the throne from Glasya. Bereft as he is, he has little to offer in exchange, so he might bargain with mortals to gain their aid in acquiring coin, jewels, and other riches in return for knowledge about the Nine Hells and the other planes.": "有传言说他经常出现在西格尔，在那里他与尤格洛特人讨价还价，以建立另一支军队，从而入侵马尔博格，从格拉西亚手中夺取王位。由于他身无分文，他没有什么可以交换的东西，所以他可能会与凡人讨价还价，以获得他们的帮助，获得钱币、珠宝和其他财富，以换取关于九层地狱和其他星球的知识。",

They have no knowledge of their link to illithids, so they're just as likely to prey on mind flayers as on anything else.": "新潮人对他们的掠夺性生存一无所知。它们在地下通道徘徊，利用它们基本的幻觉能力来搜寻并使大脑丧失能力，以满足它们持续的饥饿感，并变得越来越凶恶。这些生物可以从它们的触手管道中喷出溶解组织的酶，使受害者变成一滩粘液，只留下跳动的大脑不受伤害。它们不知道自己与illithids的联系，所以它们就像捕食其他东西一样，可能捕食心灵传播者。",
	"Mind flayers consider neothelids dangerous abominations—normally they eat or destroy any tadpoles that grow larger than a few inches in length without being implanted in a brain so they can't become such threats. Neothelids are not intelligent enough for elder brains to detect, so mind flayers are always alert for signs of their presence and organize hunting parties to exterminate any of these murderous worms they learn of.": "思想传播者认为新潮虫是危险的憎恶--通常情况下，他们会吃掉或摧毁任何生长超过几英寸长的蝌蚪，而不被植入大脑，这样他们就不会成为这种威胁。新潮虫的智慧不足以让长者的大脑察觉，因此，心灵传播者总是警惕它们存在的迹象，并组织狩猎队来消灭他们得知的任何这些杀人的虫子。",
	"The Negative Plane is a place of death, anathema to all living things. Yet there are some who would tap into its fell power and use its energy for sinister ends. Most individuals prove unequal to the task. Those not destroyed outright are sometimes drawn inside the plane and replaced by nightwalkers—terrifying Undead creatures that devour all life they encounter.": "负面世界是一个死亡之地，是所有生物的诅咒。然而，有些人想利用其堕落的力量，将其能量用于邪恶的目的。大多数人被证明不能胜任这项工作。那些没有被彻底摧毁的人有时会被吸引到平面内，被夜行者取代--可怕的不死生物吞噬了他们遇到的所有生命。",
	"One can reach the Negative Plane from the Shadowfell in places where the barrier between the planes is thin. Stepping onto the Negative Plane is almost always fatal since the plane sucks the life and soul from creatures, annihilating most at once. The few who survive by sheer luck or by harnessing some rare form of protective magic soon discover that they can't leave as easily as they arrived. Worse, for each creature that enters the plane, a nightwalker is released to take its place. In order for a trapped creature to escape, the released nightwalker must be lured back to the Negative Plane by offerings of life for it to devour. If the nightwalker is destroyed, the trapped creature has no hope of escape.": "人们可以从暗影星域到达阴性界，在两个世界之间的屏障很薄的地方。踏入阴界几乎都是致命的，因为阴界会吸走生物的生命和灵魂，一下子就把大多数人消灭了。少数靠运气或利用某种罕见的保护性魔法而幸存下来的人，很快就会发现他们不能像来时那样轻易离开。更糟的是，每有一个生物进入这个平面，就会有一个夜行者被释放出来，取代它的位置。为了让被困的生物逃脱，被释放的夜行者必须通过提供生命来诱使它回到阴界，让它吞噬。如果夜行者被摧毁，被困的生物就没有希望逃脱。",
	"Generally, a nightwalker on the Material Plane is attracted to elements of the world associated with the creature responsible for its creation, which can provide clues as to who the trapped creature is. This attraction doesn't indicate a willingness to engage with the world, though; nightwalkers exist to make life extinct, and they prioritize anything associated with the trapped creature for destruction.": "一般来说，物质界的夜行者会被世界上与负责创造它的生物有关的元素所吸引，这可以提供关于谁是被困的生物的线索。不过，这种吸引并不表示他们愿意与这个世界打交道；夜行者的存在是为了让生命灭绝，他们优先考虑与被困住的生物有关的任何东西，以进行破坏。",
	"When Maglubiyet conquered the goblin gods, a trickster deity was determined to get the last laugh. Although Maglubiyet shattered its essence, this trickster god survives in a splintered form as possessing spirits that cause disorder unless they are appeased. Goblins have no name for this deity and dare not give it one, lest Maglubiyet use its name to ensnare and crush it as he did their other deities. They call the possessing spirit, as well as the goblin possessed by it, a nilbog (\"goblin\" spelled backward), and they revel in the chaos a nilbog sows.": "当马格鲁比耶特征服了地精之神时，一个诡计多端的神灵决心笑到最后。虽然马格鲁比耶特粉碎了它的本质，但这个诡计多端的神却以分裂的形式存活下来，因为它拥有的精神除非得到安抚，否则会造成混乱。哥布林没有这个神的名字，也不敢给它起名字，以免马格鲁比耶特用它的名字来迷惑和压制它，就像他对其他神灵一样。他们称附身的灵魂以及被它附身的妖精为nilbog（\"妖精 \"倒过来拼），他们陶醉于nilbog所带来的混乱。",
	"Whenever goblinoids form a host, there is a chance that a goblin will become possessed by a nilbog, particularly if the goblins have been mistreated by their betters. The possessed goblin turns into a wisecracking, impish creature fearless of reprisal. This nilbog also gains strange powers that drive others to do the opposite of what they desire. Attacking the possessed goblin is foolhardy, and killing them just prompts the spirit to possess another goblin. The only way to keep a nilbog from wreaking havoc is to treat it well and give it respect and praise.": "每当地精形成一个宿主，就有可能出现地精被尼尔博格附身的情况，特别是当地精被他们的主人虐待时。被附身的哥布林会变成一个爱说俏皮话的、无赖的生物，不怕报复。这种地精也会获得奇怪的力量，驱使他人做与自己愿望相反的事情。攻击被附身的小妖精是愚蠢的，杀死他们只会促使灵魂附身于另一个小妖精。让尼尔博格不造成破坏的唯一方法是善待它，给予它尊重和赞美。",
	"Among fey courts, the risk of attracting a nilbog has given rise to the practice of always including at least one goblin jester. This jester is allowed to go anywhere and do whatever they please, hopefully preventing a nilbog from manifesting. The position of jester is much sought-after among the courts' goblins, because even if the jester is obviously not a nilbog, the court must indulge their chaotic behavior.": "在精灵法庭中，吸引nilbog的风险催生了总是包括至少一个地精小丑的做法。这个小丑被允许去任何地方，做任何他们想做的事，希望能阻止nilbog的出现。在法庭的妖精中，小丑的位置很抢手，因为即使小丑显然不是尼尔博格，法庭也必须纵容他们的混乱行为。",
	"A nilbog is an invisible spirit that possesses only goblins. When bereft of a host, the spirit has a flying speed of 30 feet, it can't be attacked, and it is immune to all damage and conditions. Acting on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the only action it can take is to attempt to possess a goblin within 5 feet of it.": "尼尔博格是一种无形的精神，只附身于地精。当失去宿主时，该灵魂的飞行速度为30英尺，它不能被攻击，并且对所有的伤害和条件免疫。在主动权数为20的情况下行动（失去主动权的平局），它唯一可以采取的行动是试图附身在它5英尺范围内的一个妖精。",
	"A goblin targeted by the spirit must succeed on a {@dc 15} Charisma saving throw or become possessed. While possessed, the goblin uses the nilbog stat block. If the save succeeds, the spirit can't possess that goblin for 24 hours.": "妖精的目标必须在一个{@dc 15} \"魅力储蓄 \"中成功，否则就会被附身。当被附身时，地精会使用尼尔博格的状态块。如果救赎成功，该灵魂在24小时内不能占有该妖精。",
	"If its host is killed or the possession is ended by a spell such as hallow, magic circle, or protection from evil and good, the spirit searches for another goblin to possess. The spirit can leave its host at any time, but it won't do so willingly unless it knows there's another potential host nearby. A goblin stripped of their nilbog spirit reverts to their normal statistics and loses the traits they gained while possessed.": "如果它的宿主被杀，或者被一个咒语结束了附身，比如巫术、魔法阵，或者保护邪恶和善良，那么灵魂会寻找另一个妖精来附身。灵魂可以在任何时候离开它的宿主，但它不会自愿这样做，除非它知道附近有另一个潜在的宿主。被剥夺了尼尔博格精神的地精会恢复到他们正常的统计数据，并失去他们在被附身时获得的特征。",
	"A lemure emerges from the Styx wiped of memory, yet the patterns of evil it performed in life remain indelibly inscribed upon its soul...": "一个从冥河中出现的妖怪被抹去了记忆，但它生前所做的邪恶模式仍然不可磨灭地刻在它的灵魂上。",
	"But those who lacked ambition cannot climb the hierarchical ladder of the Hells.": "但那些缺乏野心的人无法爬上地狱的等级阶梯。",
	"They instead step down, becoming nupperibos.": "他们反而下台，成为Nupperibos。",
	"No soul is turned away from the Nine Hells, but the truly worthless—those whose evil acts in life arose from carelessness and inaction more than anything else—are suitable only to become nupperibos. These pitiful creatures shuffle across the landscape, driven to purposeful action only when the clouds of swarming vermin that surround them find them prey to destroy or when a greater fiendish power commands it.": "九层地狱不会拒绝任何灵魂，但真正没有价值的人--那些在生活中因粗心和不作为而产生的邪恶行为，只适合成为nupperibos。这些可怜的生物在风景中游荡，只有当围绕着他们的蜂拥而至的害虫云发现他们是要消灭的猎物时，或者当更大的恶魔力量命令他们时，他们才会被驱使采取有目的的行动。",
	"A nupperibo knows nothing but the desire to destroy non-Fiends. Once a nupperibo's vermin cloud senses a potential meal, any nearby nupperibos pursue that prey tirelessly until it or the nupperibos are slain, or some other potential victim crosses the devils' path and distracts them.": "努珀里博只知道毁灭非异能者的欲望。一旦Nupperibo的害虫云感觉到一个潜在的食物，任何附近的Nupperibos都会不知疲倦地追逐这个猎物，直到它或Nupperibos被杀死，或者其他潜在的受害者穿过恶魔的路径并分散他们的注意力。",
	"Nupperibos unthinkingly obey any command they receive telepathically from another devil. This blind loyalty makes them the easiest of infernal troops to lead into battle, but their presence in a legion does nothing to elevate its general's status.": "Nupperibos不假思索地服从他们从另一个魔鬼那里通过心灵感应得到的任何命令。这种盲目的忠诚使他们成为最容易带入战场的地狱部队，但他们在军团中的存在对提升将军的地位毫无帮助。",
	"An oblex devours memories not only to sustain its existence, but also to spawn new oblexes. Each time it fully drains the memories of a victim, it gains the creature's personality—now twisted by the oblex's foul nature. The more memories an oblex steals, the larger it becomes, until it must shed a personality it has absorbed or else go uncontrolled and erratic. This act spawns a new oblex.": "椭圆体吞噬记忆不仅是为了维持其存在，也是为了产生新的椭圆体。每当它完全吸干一个受害者的记忆时，它就会获得该生物的个性--现在已经被卵石的肮脏本性所扭曲。卵石窃取的记忆越多，它就变得越大，直到它必须舍弃它所吸收的人格，否则就会失去控制和不稳定。这种行为会产生一个新的卵石。",
	"Newly formed oblexes lack the capabilities of their older kin. They seek only to feed on memories and grow until they can impersonate their victims.": "新形成的Oblexes缺乏其较年长亲属的能力。它们只寻求以记忆为食，并不断成长，直到它们能够冒充受害者。",
	"Mind flayers unleash all manner of foul experiments upon the planes with little thought for the consequences. Here, though, I suspect another influence: Juiblex.": "洗心革面者在平面上释放出各种肮脏的实验，几乎不考虑后果。不过，在这里，我怀疑是另一种影响。聚宝斋。",
	"An oblex wants memories, but not to serve any end of its own making. Oblexes are hungry for memories and personalities because they are empty without such nourishment. In this way they serve their creators, the illithids. An oblex in the range of an elder brain's powers provides everything necessary for the mind flayers to find choice victims.": "一个Oblex想要记忆，但不是为了服务于它自己制造的任何目的。Oblexes渴望记忆和个性，因为没有这种滋养，它们是空虚的。通过这种方式，它们为它们的创造者服务，即illithids。在一个长老大脑的能力范围内的Oblex，可以为心灵掠夺者提供一切必要的东西来寻找选择受害者。",
	"By experimenting on the slimes, jellies, and puddings that infest the depths of the Underdark, mind flayers created a special breed of Ooze, the oblex—a slime capable of assaulting the minds of other creatures. These pools ofjelly are cunning hunters that feed on thoughts and memories. The sharper the mind, the better the meal, so oblexes hunt targets more likely to be intelligent, such as wizards and other spellcasters. When suitable fare comes within reach, an oblex draws its body up to engulf its victim. As it withdraws, it plunders the creature's mind, leaving its prey befuddled and confused—or dead.": "通过在地下世界深处的粘液、果冻和布丁上进行实验，思想传播者创造了一种特殊的泥浆，即奥布拉克斯--一种能够攻击其他生物思想的粘液。这些果冻池是狡猾的猎手，以思想和记忆为食。思想越敏锐，食物就越好，因此，Oblexs猎杀的目标更可能是聪明人，如巫师和其他施法者。当合适的食物触手可及时，大蛇就会拉起它的身体吞噬受害者。在撤退的过程中，它会掠夺生物的思想，让猎物感到困惑和迷茫，或者死亡。",
	"When oblexes feed on thoughts, they can form weird copies of their prey to use as lures, which helps them harvest even more victims for their mind flayer masters.": "当Oblexes以思想为食时，它们可以形成猎物的怪异副本作为诱饵，这有助于它们为它们的心灵传播者主人收获更多的受害者。",

	"A bolt launcher carries a gigantic crossbow—a weapon so large it's essentially an ogre-held ballista. An ogre bolt launcher can load this immense weapon and loose its deadly missile as quickly as a dwarf handles a crossbow.

	"Those who have fought shadow dancers describe the experience as similar to fighting a living darkness.

Pale and seemingly lidless eyes glare balefully from a face distorted by too many teeth and too little nose. Hulks are seldom encountered without a commanding star spawn seer (also in this book) nearby. A hulk appears to have little will of its own and is driven to protect its master.": "绿巨人是已知星体中最大的一个，有着闪闪发光的半透明皮肤。苍白的、似乎没有盖子的眼睛从一张因牙齿太多、鼻子太少而扭曲的脸上怒视着。如果附近没有一个指挥星体产卵的预言家（也在本书中），很少会遇到绿巨人。绿巨人似乎没有自己的意志，而是被驱使着去保护它的主人。",
	"A larva mage is a nightmarish combination of a mortal body and otherworldly substance. When a powerful cultist of a wormlike entity such as Kyuss or Kezef—usually a warlock or other spellcaster—contacts the comet-borne emissary of an Elder Evil, the emissary can merge with a mortal consciousness to create a larva mage. None of the original cultist's personality survives the transformation; what emerges is wholly alien.": "幼虫法师是一个噩梦般的凡人身体和其他世界物质的组合。当一个强大的虫类实体（如Kyuss或Kezef）的崇拜者--通常是术士或其他施法者--接触到由彗星携带的上古恶魔的使者时，该使者可以与凡人的意识融合，创造出一个幼虫法师。原先邪教者的人格在转化过程中无一幸存；出现的是完全陌生的。",

	"In truth, there is no one place or space from which they come. There is the multiverse of things that are, and there is the multiverse of things that shouldn't be.": "事实上，没有一个地方或空间是它们的来源。有存在的事物的多元宇宙，也有不应该存在的事物的多元宇宙。",
	"A mangler is a low-slung, creeping horror with multiple gangly arms—it most often has six arms but can have any number from four to eight. Manglers creep along the ground or the walls, sticking to shadows and hiding in spots that seem too shallow or well-lit to conceal anything. They appear smaller than their true size, thanks to their hunched posture and emaciated frames. Cultists summon these creatures to serve as guards and assassins, two roles at which they excel.": "莽汉是一种低矮的、匍匐前进的恐怖动物，它有多条粗壮的手臂--最常见的是六条手臂，但也可以有四到八条任何数量。莽汉沿着地面或墙壁匍匐前进，粘附在阴影中，躲藏在看起来太浅或光线充足的地方，无法掩盖任何东西。由于他们的驼背姿势和憔悴的框架，他们看起来比他们的真实尺寸要小。崇拜者们召唤这些生物来充当警卫和刺客，这是他们擅长的两个角色。",
	"A star spawn seer is most often encountered as the leader of a cult dedicated to one or more Elder Evils. Usually, the seer is the only cult member that grasps the full extent of the horror the cult is venerating. The seer's goal is to tap into vast energy sources and perform the dire rites that will extend a bridge between the Material Plane and the squirming chaos of an Elder Evil's realm.": "星产预言家最常遇到的情况是，他是一个致力于一个或多个上古恶魔的邪教组织的领袖。通常情况下，预言家是唯一掌握该邪教所崇敬的恐怖事物的成员。预言家的目标是挖掘巨大的能量来源，并进行可怕的仪式，从而在物质世界和长老恶魔的领域的蠕动混乱之间架起一座桥梁。",
	"An entity that appears as a star spawn seer in the Material Plane usually arrives disembodied. When a warlock or other spellcaster establishes communication with it, the seer-entity takes control of the mortal, transforming it into a star spawn seer. Whoever the mortal once was largely vanishes beneath the mass of tumorous skin than builds up in strange whorls all over the seer's body. The mortal's hands become bulky, flipper-like appendages able to grasp the seer's strange staff formed of a blend of flesh, bone, and star stuff.": "在物质世界中作为星产预言家出现的实体，通常是以非实体的方式到达。当术士或其他施法者与之建立沟通时，预言者实体就会控制凡人，将其转化为一个星产预言者。不管这个凡人曾经是谁，都会在肿瘤性皮肤下消失，而肿瘤性皮肤会在预言者的身体上形成奇怪的漩涡。凡人的手变成了笨重的鳍状附属物，能够抓住预言家由肉、骨和星辰物质混合而成的奇怪的法杖。",
	"A star spawn seer is almost always accompanied by one or more star spawn hulks (also in this book). Not only is a hulk a powerful combatant, but when a seer deals psychic damage to a hulk, the hulk isn't hurt, and the effect ricochets off and expands to assault other creatures.": "一个星产预言家几乎总是伴随着一个或多个星产绿巨人（也在本书中）。绿巨人不仅具有强大的战斗力，而且当预言家对绿巨人造成精神伤害时，绿巨人并没有受到伤害，其效果会反弹并扩展到攻击其他生物。",
	"Steeders resemble spiders as much as worgs resemble wolves. The creatures may appear similar, but steeders are more than mere vermin.": "骏马类似于蜘蛛，就像虫子类似于狼一样。这些生物可能看起来很相似，但骏马不仅仅是害虫。",
	"Giant hunting spiders, steeders prowl the depths of the Underdark. Female steeders grow larger and stronger than males, and the female often devours the male after breeding. Numerous Underdark folk domesticate steeders, particularly duergar (also in this book). Typically the females serve as steeds in battle, while the males are used as draft animals.": "巨大的狩猎蜘蛛，Steeders在地下城的深处游荡。雌性骏马比雄性骏马长得更大更强壮，雌性骏马在繁殖后往往会吞噬雄性骏马。许多暗黑世界的居民驯化了骏马，尤其是duergar（也在本书中）。通常情况下，雌性在战斗中充当骏马，而雄性则被用作草畜。",
	"Steeders attempt to tear apart perceived threats—and consider even other steeders enemies. When they're put to work, their handlers must stable them separately from one another and place blinders on them to keep them from attacking each other.": "骏马试图撕碎感知到的威胁，甚至认为其他骏马是敌人。当它们被投入工作时，它们的饲养员必须将它们彼此分开，并给它们戴上眼罩，防止它们互相攻击。",
	"Steeders are intelligent enough to learn simple hand signals and vocal commands, but even a domesticated steeder might turn against its handler. Training a steeder requires a rider to bond with it, a process that begins shortly after the steeder hatches. As it grows, its rider works with it to direct its predatory instincts.": "骏马很聪明，可以学习简单的手势和声音命令，但即使是驯养的骏马也可能会反过来对付它的驯养者。训练一只骏马需要骑手与它建立联系，这个过程在骏马孵化后不久就开始了。随着它的成长，它的骑手与它一起工作，引导它的捕食本能。",
	"Rather than spinning webs, steeders excrete a viscous substance from their legs. This goo allows them to creep along walls and ceilings and to grapple prey.": "骏马没有织网，而是从腿上排泄出一种粘性物质。这种粘性物质使它们能够沿着墙壁和天花板爬行，并抓取猎物。",
	"A steel predator is a merciless machine with one purpose: to locate and kill its target regardless of distance and obstacles.": "钢铁掠夺者是一个无情的机器，其目的只有一个：不顾距离和障碍，找到并杀死目标。",
	"Steel predators are created by a unique modron, using a machine located in the city of Sigil. It wasn't always headquartered in the City of Doors, however. On its original home, the plane of Mechanus, the ingenious modron was lauded for its invention—until it turned these creations against its superiors. Steel predators wreaked havoc against the modron hierarchy until the rogue modron was trapped and exiled. Now it operates a shop in Sigil where, for a steep price, anyone can commission the manufacture of a steel predator.": "钢铁掠夺者是由一个独特的modron创造的，使用位于Sigil市的一台机器。然而，它的总部并不总是在门之城。在它最初的家，也就是麦坎纳斯（Mechanus）星球上，聪明的莫德隆因其发明而受到称赞，直到它把这些创造物用来对付它的上级领导。钢铁掠夺者对莫德隆的等级制度造成了严重的破坏，直到流氓莫德隆被困住并被流放。现在，它在Sigil经营着一家商店，只要付出高昂的代价，任何人都可以委托制造一个钢铁捕食者。",
	"To create a steel predator, the modron's machine must be fed something that identifies the predator's target, such as a lock of hair, a well-worn glove, or a much-used weapon. The moment the newly manufactured steel predator emerges, it bounds away in search of its prey. It senses the location of its target across planar boundaries, but such detection is accurate only to within a thousand yards; to close the remaining distance, the steel predator locates its prey by sight and smell.": "要创造一个钢铁捕食者，必须给modron的机器提供一些能识别捕食者目标的东西，如一绺头发、一只破旧的手套或一件经常使用的武器。新制造的钢铁捕食者出现的那一刻，它就跳开寻找它的猎物。它能跨越平面边界感知目标的位置，但这种探测只能精确到一千码以内；为了拉近剩余的距离，钢铁捕食者通过视觉和嗅觉来定位其猎物。",
	"Once battle is joined, the predator ignores every other threat to attack its target, unless other creatures prevent it from reaching the target. In that case, it does what it must to fulfill its mission.": "一旦加入战斗，捕食者就会无视所有其他威胁来攻击其目标，除非其他生物阻止它到达目标。在这种情况下，它要做它必须做的事情来完成它的任务。",
	"If all goes according to plan, a steel predator slays its target and then voluntarily returns to Sigil, where it's broken down into parts that can be used in another steel predator. Battle damage can cause this instinct to fail, however, in which case the steel predator lingers in the area, hunting and killing other creatures that resemble its target or that simply live nearby. Such rogue predators are dangerous to anyone in the vicinity.": "如果一切按计划进行，钢铁捕食者会杀死它的目标，然后自愿返回Sigil，在那里它被分解成可以用于另一个钢铁捕食者的部件。然而，战斗的伤害可能会导致这种本能的失败，在这种情况下，钢铁捕食者会在该地区徘徊，猎杀与目标相似的其他生物，或者只是住在附近。这样的流氓掠夺者对附近的任何人都是危险的。",
	"This heavily built dinosaur has rows of plates on its back and a flexible, spiked tail held high to strike predators. It tends to travel in herds of mixed ages.": "这种身材魁梧的恐龙背上有一排排的板块，有一条灵活的、带刺的尾巴高高举起，以打击捕食者。它倾向于在混合年龄段的群体中旅行。",
	"Stench kows are misshapen bison native to the Lower Planes. These orange and green creatures defend themselves by exuding a miasma so hideous as to be toxic.

	"Stone cursed possess a malevolent drive to slay the living, yet they are utterly loyal to whoever performed the ritual to animate them, and they obey that being's orders to the best of their ability. In combat, stony claws that drip with thick, gray sludge emerge from a stone cursed's fingers. This alchemical sludge transforms those slashed by the claws into statues.": "石头诅咒者拥有杀死活人的邪恶动力，但他们完全忠于为他们举行仪式的人，并尽其所能地服从那个人的命令。在战斗中，石质的爪子会从石质诅咒者的手指上滴下厚厚的灰色淤泥。这种炼金污泥能将被爪子砍伤的人变成雕像。",
	"As part of the ritual used to create a stone cursed, a fist-sized obsidian skull forms within the creature's torso. The skull isn't visible while the stone cursed is active, but when it is slain, the statue shatters and the skull clatters to the ground. Because it is the nexus for the alchemy used to create these horrors, a faint echo of the original victim's memories resonates within the skull. A skilled magic-wielder can attempt to extract memories from it to gain insight into the victim's past or find lore that otherwise would be lost.": "作为创造石像诅咒的仪式的一部分，一个拳头大小的黑曜石头骨在生物的躯干内形成。当石像诅咒处于活动状态时，头骨是不可见的，但当它被杀死时，雕像就会破碎，头骨就会哗啦啦地掉在地上。因为它是用来创造这些恐怖的炼金术的核心，所以在头骨中会有最初受害者的记忆的微弱回声产生共鸣。熟练的施法者可以尝试从它身上提取记忆，以深入了解受害者的过去，或者找到否则就会丢失的传说。",
	"Even though a creature transformed into a stone cursed is long dead, a vague whisper of their memories lives on in the obsidian skull embedded within the stone cursed's body. At the end of a short rest, a character can make a {@dc 20} Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check to attempt to extract a memory from the skull that is a response to a verbal question posed to the skull by the character. Once this check is made, whether it succeeds or fails, the skull can't be used in this manner again.": "即使被转化为石像鬼的生物早已死亡，但他们的记忆仍在嵌在石像鬼身体里的黑曜石头骨中隐约流传。在短暂的休息结束后，一个角色可以进行一次{@dc 20}智力({@skill Arcana})检查，试图从头骨中提取一段记忆，这段记忆是对角色向头骨提出的口头问题的回应。一旦做了这个检查，不管是成功还是失败，这个头骨都不能再以这种方式使用。",
	"The surface of the world is an alien realm to stone giants: fluctuating, temporary, exposed to gusting wind and sudden rain. It is as wildly changeable as a dream, and that's how they regard it—as a dream. Nothing there is permanent, so nothing there is real. What happens on the surface doesn't matter. Promises and bargains made there needn't be honored. Life and even art hold less value there.": "世界的表面对石巨人来说是一个陌生的领域：波动的、暂时的、暴露在阵风和骤雨中。它就像一个梦一样变化无常，他们就是这样看待它--一个梦。那里没有任何东西是永久的，所以那里没有任何东西是真实的。表面上发生的事情并不重要。在那里做出的承诺和交易不需要兑现。生命甚至艺术在那里的价值较低。",
	"Stone giants sometimes go on dream quests in the surface world, seeking inspiration for their art, a break from decades-long ennui, or satisfaction of simple curiosity. Some who go on these quests let themselves become lost in the dream. Other stone giants are banished to the surface as punishment. Regardless of the reason they ended up on the surface, if they don't take shelter under stone, such stone giants can become dreamwalkers.": "石头巨人有时会在地表世界进行梦境探险，为他们的艺术寻找灵感，从几十年来的沉闷中解脱出来，或者满足简单的好奇心。一些去做这些探索的人让自己迷失在梦中。其他石像巨人则被放逐到地表作为惩罚。无论他们在地表上的原因是什么，如果他们不在石头下避难，这样的石像巨人就会成为梦游者。",
	"Dreamwalkers occupy an odd place of respect outside the stone giant ordning. They are considered outcasts, but their familiarity with the surface world makes them valuable guides, and their insights can help other stone giants grasp the dangers of living in a dream.": "梦游者在石巨人军团之外占据了一个奇怪的尊重位置。他们被认为是弃儿，但他们对表面世界的熟悉使他们成为有价值的向导，他们的洞察力可以帮助其他石巨人掌握生活在梦中的危险。",
	"Dreamwalkers become divorced from reality by isolation, shame, and their unendingly alien surroundings, and this delirium leaches out into the world around them, affecting other creatures that get too close. Believing that they're living in a dream and that their actions have no real consequences, dreamwalkers act as they please, becoming forces of chaos. As they travel the world, they collect objects and creatures that seem especially significant to them. Over time, the collected things accrete to their bodies, becoming encased in stone.": "梦游者因孤独、羞耻和无休止的陌生环境而脱离现实，这种谵妄会渗入他们周围的世界，影响其他过于接近的生物。梦游者相信他们生活在梦中，他们的行为没有真正的后果，他们随心所欲地行动，成为混乱的力量。当他们环游世界时，他们收集那些对他们来说似乎特别重要的物品和生物。随着时间的推移，收集到的东西会累积到他们的身体里，成为包裹在石头里的东西。",
	"To forestall the inevitable, some storm giants approaching the end of their natural life spans seek an escape from death. They plumb the depths of their powerful connection to the elements and disperse themselves into nature, transforming into semiconscious storms. The blizzard that rages unendingly around a mountain peak, the vortex that swirls around a remote island, or the thunderstorm that howls ceaselessly up and down a rugged coastline could, in fact, be the undying form of a storm giant clinging to existence.": "为了防止不可避免的情况发生，一些接近自然寿命终点的风暴巨人寻求逃离死亡。他们挖掘自己与元素的强大联系的深度，并将自己分散到自然界中，转化为半意识的风暴。在一座山峰周围无休止地肆虐的暴风雪，在一个遥远的岛屿周围旋转的漩涡，或者在崎岖的海岸线上无休止地嚎叫的雷暴，事实上，可能是一个风暴巨人坚持存在的不死形态。",

	"A storm giant quintessent can revert to their true giant form temporarily and can maintain that form long enough for the giant to communicate with a mortal, carry out a short task, or defend their home against aggressors.": "风暴巨人的五官可以暂时恢复到他们真正的巨人形态，并且可以保持这种形态足够长的时间，以便巨人与凡人交流，执行一个简短的任务，或者保护他们的家园不受侵略者侵犯。",
	"A storm giant quintessent has no need for castles or dungeon lairs. Their lair is usually a secluded region or prominent geographic feature, such as a mountain peak, a great waterfall, a remote island, a fog-shrouded loch, a beautiful coral reef, or a windswept desert bluff. The storm in which the giant lives could be a blizzard, a typhoon, a thunderstorm, or a sandstorm, as befits the environment.": "风暴巨人五人组不需要城堡或地牢的巢穴。他们的巢穴通常是一个僻静的地区或突出的地理特征，如一座山峰、一个大瀑布、一个遥远的岛屿、一个雾气笼罩的湖泊、一个美丽的珊瑚礁，或一个风吹草动的沙漠悬崖。巨人所处的风暴可能是暴风雪、台风、雷暴或沙尘暴，这与环境相适应。",

They also settle down temporarily whenever it's time to lay eggs and hatch a new brood of young.": "Tlincallis只在一个地方停留，只要附近地区的狩猎情况良好，尽管它们在游荡过程中可能会反复访问同一途径的站点。每当到了产卵和孵化新一窝幼崽的时候，它们也会暂时安顿下来。",
	"These scorpion folk deposit their eggs in warm places out of direct sunlight, often amid a stand of cacti near their present encampment. The eggs are protected by hard shells coated in paralytic poison similar to that produced by their stingers. This poison leaves most would-be predators that dare to break an egg defenseless when the tlincalli parents come to investigate.": "这些蝎子民将它们的卵存放在温暖的地方，避免阳光直射，通常是在它们现在的营地附近的仙人掌林中。卵被涂有麻痹性毒药的硬壳所保护，这种毒药类似于它们的毒刺所产生的毒药。这种毒药使大多数敢于打破蛋的潜在捕食者在林卡利父母来调查时毫无还手之力。",
	"Tlincallis eat what they kill, whether their hunt nets desert animals or a caravan, but when they have new mouths to feed, they are careful to take some of their prey alive. After using their stingers to paralyze victims and their spiked chains to bind them, tlincallis take these captives back to their encampment and tie them to cacti or rock formations. When the sun sets, the newly hatched young emerge from the lair to eat the captives alive.": "Tlincallis吃他们所杀的东西，无论他们的猎物是沙漠动物还是商队，但当他们有新的嘴要喂时，他们会小心翼翼地活捉一些猎物。在用它们的毒刺麻痹受害者，用它们的带刺链条捆绑他们之后，Tlincallis把这些俘虏带回它们的营地，把它们绑在仙人掌或岩层上。当太阳落山时，新孵化的幼鸟从巢穴中出来，将俘虏活活吃掉。",
	"These predators see themselves as great hunters, and respect others with such skills. If a tlincalli encounters a more powerful hunter, such as a blue dragon, they carefully weigh whether to serve the superior hunter, move on, or fight to the death to remove it as competition.": "这些捕食者认为自己是伟大的猎手，并尊重具有这种技能的其他人。如果特林卡利遇到一个更强大的猎手，如蓝龙，它们会仔细权衡是为这个优秀的猎手服务，继续前进，还是拼死一搏，将其作为竞争对手清除。",
	"Tlincallis rarely build cities, make clothing, or mine metals. Instead, they scavenge much of what they need or want. They do, however, melt down scavenged metal to forge crude weapons, armor, and tools.": "特林卡利斯人很少建造城市，制造衣服，或开采金属。相反，他们需要或想要的大部分东西都是捡来的。然而，他们确实会熔化搜刮来的金属，以锻造粗糙的武器、盔甲和工具。",
	"The generic tortle stat block here represents a warrior, especially the sort who travels far and wide.": "这里的通用跗骨之蛆状态块代表一个战士，特别是那种远行的战士。",
	"Many tortles view the world as a place of wonder. They live for the chance to hear a soft wind blowing through trees, to watch a frog croaking on a lily pad, or to stand in a crowded marketplace. A tortle druid savors such things more than most, channeling the natural magic of the world around them.": "许多托尔人将世界视为一个充满奇迹的地方。他们为有机会听到轻柔的风吹过树木，观看青蛙在荷花池上呱呱叫，或站在拥挤的市场上而活着。一个托尔德鲁伊比大多数人更喜欢这样的事情，引导他们周围世界的自然魔法。",
	"Tortles are omnivorous, turtle-like bipeds with shells that cover most of their bodies. Because they carry their homes on their backs, tortles feel little need to stay put for long.": "甲鱼是杂食性的，类似于乌龟的双足动物，它们的壳覆盖了大部分身体。由于它们把自己的家背在背上，龟类觉得没有必要长时间呆在原地。",
	"Most tortles like to see how other folk live. A tortle can spend decades away from their native land without feeling homesick, often viewing their current companions as their family.": "大多数托尔人喜欢看其他民族的生活方式。一个托尔人可以在远离故土的地方呆上几十年而不觉得想家，常常把他们现在的同伴视为自己的家人。",
	"Transmuters are masters at transforming physical forms. They typically view magical transmutation as a path to riches, enlightenment, or apotheosis.": "转化者是转化物理形式的大师。他们通常将魔法转化视为通往财富、启蒙或神化的途径。",
	"A trapper is a manta-like creature that usually lurks in subterranean environments. It can change the color and texture of its tough, outward-facing side to help it blend in with its surroundings, while its soft, inward-facing side clings to the floor, wall, or ceiling in its hunting territory. It remains motionless as it waits for prey to come close. When a target is within its reach, it peels itself away from the surface and wraps around its prey, crushing, smothering, and then digesting it. Only a scattering of bones, metal, treasure, and other indigestible bits is left behind.": "捕猎者是一种类似蝠鲼的生物，通常潜伏在地下环境中。它可以改变其坚韧的、朝外的一面的颜色和质地，以帮助它与周围环境融为一体，而其柔软的、朝内的一面则依附在其狩猎区的地板、墙壁或天花板上。当它等待猎物靠近时，它保持不动。当目标在它触手可及的范围内时，它将自己从表面剥离，包裹住猎物，将其压碎、闷死，然后消化掉。只留下零星的骨头、金属、财宝和其他难以消化的碎片。",
	"A trapper's ability to alter the color and texture of its outer side enables it to blend in with any surface made of stone, earth, or wood, masking its presence to any but the most rigorous scrutiny. It can't change its texture to that of a grassy or snow-covered surface, but it is just cunning enough to change its color to match and then conceal itself under a thin layer of vegetation or actual snow.": "捕猎者能够改变其外侧的颜色和纹理，使其能够融入任何由石头、泥土或木材制成的表面，除了最严格的审查外，还能掩盖其存在。它不能把自己的质地改变成草地或白雪覆盖的表面，但它足够狡猾，可以改变自己的颜色，然后把自己隐藏在一层薄薄的植物或真正的雪下。",
	"A trapper that lurks on the floor of its hunting grounds can cover any remains there with its body, making them look like irregularities in the surface. The creature might instead attach itself to a nearby wall or a ceiling, using the remnants as bait; any creature that stops to investigate the bones for valuables becomes the trapper's next meal.": "潜伏在其狩猎场地上的捕兽者可以用它的身体覆盖那里的任何残骸，使它们看起来像表面的不规则物。这种生物可能会把自己附在附近的墙壁或天花板上，用这些残骸作为诱饵；任何停下来调查这些骨头是否有价值的生物都会成为捕兽者的下一顿饭。",
	"A trapper needs to eat a {@race halfling}-sized meal once per week to remain sated. Given a steady supply of food, trappers are content to stay in one place, making them a threat along well-traveled dungeon corridor and on routes through the wilderness that see a lot of traffic. When prey is scarce, a trapper enters a state of hibernation that can last for months, though it is still aware when prey comes near. A trapper on the verge of starvation might defy its instincts and abandon its old territory in search of better hunting.": "一个捕猎者每周需要吃一次{@race halfling}大小的食物才能保持饱腹感。如果有稳定的食物供应，捕猎者就会满足于呆在一个地方，这使得他们在交通便利的地牢走廊和穿越荒野的路线上成为威胁。当猎物稀少时，捕猎者会进入冬眠状态，可持续数月之久，不过当猎物靠近时，它仍能察觉。处于饥饿边缘的捕猎者可能会违背自己的本能，放弃自己的旧领地，去寻找更好的猎物。",
	"Trolls that are nearly obliterated but survive and regenerate from mere scraps of flesh can display bizarre features. Radically transformed trolls like the rot trolls, spirit trolls, and venom trolls that follow are especially likely to arise when trolls regenerate in the presence of magical emanations, planar energy, disease, or death on a vast scale, or if their bodies were damaged by elemental forces. These unusual forms can also be produced and shaped by the ritual magic of evil spellcasters or by trolls' own practices, as is the case for dire trolls.": "那些几乎被消灭，但从单纯的肉体碎片中存活并再生的巨魔，会表现出奇异的特征。像后面的腐烂巨魔、精神巨魔和毒液巨魔这样彻底转变的巨魔，当巨魔在魔法辐射、平面能量、疾病或大规模死亡的情况下再生时，或者当他们的身体被元素力量破坏时，特别容易出现。这些不寻常的形态也可以由邪恶的施法者的仪式魔法或巨魔自己的做法产生和塑造，可怕的巨魔就是这种情况。",
	"Although trolls are rarely devout and seldom ponder spiritual questions, some fear and venerate the entity known as Vaprak the Destroyer. Vaprak's true nature is something of a mystery, but Vaprak is always portrayed as a horrid, misshapen, greenish creature strongly resembling a troll. Vaprak is given to fits of mindless destruction and uncontrollably fears the plots and ambitions of other deities.": "虽然巨魔很少虔诚，也很少思考精神问题，但有些人害怕并崇敬被称为毁灭者瓦普拉克的实体。瓦普拉克的真实性质是个谜，但瓦普拉克总是被描绘成一个可怕的、畸形的、绿色的生物，与巨魔非常相似。瓦普拉克喜欢无意识的破坏，并且无法控制地害怕其他神祗的阴谋和野心。",
	"Vaprak's troll worshipers believe this god devours the souls of those who have been cooked or digested (slain by fire or acid). Otherwise, the god spits the soul back into the world to regenerate a new body.": "瓦普拉克的巨魔崇拜者相信这位神会吞噬那些被煮熟或消化（被火或酸杀死）的人的灵魂。否则，该神会将灵魂吐回世界，让其再生出一个新的身体。",

	"Vampiric mists, sometimes called crimson mists, are all that remain of {@creature vampire||vampires} who couldn't return to their burial places after being defeated or suf fering some mishap. Denied the restorative power of these places, the {@creature vampire||vampires'} bodies dissolve into mist. The transformation strips the intelligence and personality from them until only an unholy, insatiable thirst for blood remains.": "吸血鬼的迷雾，有时被称为深红色的迷雾，是{@creature vampire||vampires}在被打败或遭遇一些意外后无法回到他们的埋葬地所留下的一切。被剥夺了这些地方的恢复能力，{@creature vampire||vampires'}的尸体就会溶入雾中。这种转变剥夺了他们的智慧和个性，直到只剩下对血的不洁、不满足的渴求。",
	"Indistinguishable from fog aside from the charnel reek it exudes, a vampiric mist descends on a creature and causes the blood in the creature's body to ooze through its pores or spill out from its eyes, nose, and mouth. This blood wafts out from the victim like crimson smoke, which the mist then consumes. The feeding causes no pain or discomfort to the victim, so vampiric mists can feed on sleepers without waking them. The more a mist feeds, the redder it gets, such that it turns pink, then red, and finally a deep scarlet hue; when sated, it rains blood droplets wherever it goes.": "除了散发出的腐臭味之外，它和雾没有区别，吸血鬼的雾气降临在生物身上，使生物体内的血液从毛孔中渗出，或从眼睛、鼻子和嘴里溢出。这些血像深红色的烟雾一样从受害者身上飘出，然后被雾气吞噬。吸食不会给受害者带来任何痛苦或不适，所以吸血魔雾可以在不惊醒他们的情况下吸食睡眠者。迷雾进食得越多，它就越红，比如它变成粉红色，然后变成红色，最后变成深猩红色；当它吃饱后，无论走到哪里都会下血滴。",
	"Like sharks in water, vampiric mists can scent blood from up to a mile away. Any injury, no matter how small, might catch their attention and draw them toward their victims. In battle, a mist focuses its attacks on injured targets, since open wounds are a more ready source of blood.": "就像水中的鲨鱼一样，吸血鬼迷雾可以在一英里外闻到血腥味。任何伤害，无论多小，都可能引起它们的注意，并把它们引向受害者。在战斗中，迷雾会集中攻击受伤的目标，因为开放的伤口是更容易获得血液的来源。",
	"Shrieking, flapping, and hideous to behold—with a body like a severed head and wings in place of ears—vargouilles boil out of the Abyss to infest other planes of existence, such as Carceri, where they are a menace.

	"Swarms of vargouilles flap through the caverns and skies of the Abyss. They are given little regard by powerful and intelligent demons since vargouilles can do them no harm. Even the weakest demon, such as a manes or a dretch, fears vargouilles only if they appear in great numbers. In the Lower Planes, vargouilles rarely get the chance to eat live prey other than vermin. More often, they lap up the ichor left behind when one Fiend kills another.": "成群的马古拉斯在深渊的洞穴和天空中飞舞。强大而聪明的恶魔对它们不屑一顾，因为马古拉斯不能对它们造成任何伤害。即使是最弱小的恶魔，如鬃毛或德雷克，也只有在它们大量出现时才会惧怕马古拉斯。在下层世界，除了害虫之外，马犼兽很少有机会吃活的猎物。更多的时候，它们会舔食一个恶魔杀死另一个恶魔时留下的汁液。",
	"Because of their hunger for living prey, vargouilles are eager to escape the Lower Planes. On rare occasions, summoning a demon to another plane can bring a vargouille along for the ride, attached like a tick. The precautions a mortal takes to control a summoned demon rarely account for a stowaway, enabling the vargouille to escape into the world.": "由于它们对活体猎物的饥渴，瓦古里人渴望逃离下层世界。在极少数情况下，将一个恶魔召唤到另一个位面，可以将马古拉斯带在身边，像虱子一样附着。凡人为控制被召唤的恶魔所采取的预防措施很少会考虑到偷渡者，从而使马犼兽能够逃到这个世界。",
	"Vargouilles that roam free on the Material Plane are a dire threat to all creatures. Their awful shrieking can {@condition paralyzed||paralyze} other creatures with fear, which also makes the creatures susceptible to the vargouille's curse. If the curse is allowed to run its course, an abyssal spirit invades the person's body, causing a gruesome transformation. Over a period of hours, the victim's head takes on fiendish aspects, such as fangs, tentacles, and horns. At the same time, the person's ears grow larger, expanding into wing-like appendages. In the final moments, the victim's head tears away from the body in a fountain of blood, becoming another vargouille, which often then eagerly laps up the blood spilling from its former body. Sunlight or the brilliant illumination of a {@spell daylight} spell can delay this transformation; otherwise, only magic can overcome the curse. ": "在物质界自由游荡的瓦古里对所有生物都是一个可怕的威胁。他们可怕的尖叫声会让其他生物感到恐惧，这也使得这些生物容易受到瓦古里的诅咒。如果诅咒被允许运行，一个深渊的灵魂会侵入人的身体，导致可怕的转变。在几个小时内，受害者的头部会呈现出恶魔般的面貌，如獠牙、触角和角。同时，这个人的耳朵变大，扩展成翅膀状的附属物。在最后的时刻，受害者的头在血泉中从身体上撕下，成为另一个马格里布，然后经常急切地舔食从其前身体上溢出的血液。阳光或(1%)法术的明亮照明可以延迟这种转变；否则，只有魔法才能克服诅咒。",
	"Although they prefer to eat fresh meat, bone, and blood, vegepygmies can absorb nutrients from soil and many sorts of organic matter, so they rarely go hungry. A vegepygmy can hiss and make other noises by forcing air through its mouth, but it can't speak in a conventional sense. Among themselves, vegepygmies communicate by hissing, gestures, and tapping. Vegepygmies build and craft little; any gear they have is acquired from other creatures or built by copying simple construction they have witnessed.": "虽然它们更喜欢吃新鲜的肉、骨头和血，但素食者可以从土壤和许多种类的有机物中吸收营养，所以它们很少挨饿。素食者可以发出嘶嘶声，并通过嘴里的空气发出其他声音，但它不能在传统意义上说话。在它们之间，素食主义者通过嘶嘶声、手势和敲击来交流。维格米人很少建造和制作；他们拥有的任何装备都是从其他生物那里获得的，或者是通过复制他们所看到的简单结构来建造的。",

	"The Beast of Butchery appears as a great scarred gnoll, towering 14 feet tall. Yeenoghu is the Gnoll Lord, and his creations are made in his twisted image. When the demon lord hunted across the Material Plane, packs of hyenas followed in his wake, and those that ate of great Yeenoghu's kills became gnolls. Few others worship the Beast of Butchery, but those who do tend to take on a gnoll-like aspect, hunching over and filing their teeth down to points.": "屠戮之兽以一个巨大的有疤痕的地精出现，高达14英尺。耶诺古是地精之王，他的创造物是按照他扭曲的形象制造的。当这位恶魔领主在整个物质世界狩猎时，成群的鬣狗跟在他的后面，那些吃了耶诺古的猎物的人变成了地精。很少有人崇拜屠戮之兽，但那些崇拜的人往往具有地精一样的外表，驼背，把牙齿磨得很尖。",
	"Yeenoghu wants nothing more than slaughter and senseless destruction. Gnolls are his favorite instruments, and he drives his gnoll followers to ever-greater atrocities in his name, even imbuing some of their commanders with his powers, which transforms them into flinds (in this book). Yeenoghu takes pleasure in causing fear before death, and he sows sorrow and despair through destroying beloved things. He doesn't parlay; to meet him is to do battle with him—unless he becomes bored and wanders away.

	"When a zaratan is summoned from the Elemental Plane of Earth, the ground rises up to take the shape of a hulking, armored reptile. A zaratan's steps trigger shock waves severe enough to level structures. It expresses its rage through trumpeting calls and the occasional boulder or blast of debris it spews from its cavernous maw. If seriously injured, a zaratan retracts its appendages to gain shelter beneath its impervious shell, biding its time until it recovers and can resume its march.": "当Zaratan被从地球元素界召唤出来时，地面会升起一个巨大的、带着盔甲的爬虫形状。扎拉坦的脚步引发的冲击波足以夷平建筑物。它通过号角声和偶尔的巨石或从其洞穴中喷出的碎片来表达其愤怒。如果受了重伤，扎拉坦会缩回它的附肢，在它不透光的外壳下获得庇护，等待时机，直到它恢复并能继续行进。",

	"To replenish her legions, Zariel needs the souls of mortals to create lemures, which she can then promote to higher forms of devils.

However, she expects the best from her servants, so she allows her mortal followers to live out their lives provided they continue to hone their talents to increase their value. As a result, Zariel's servants are universally effective, disciplined, and dangerous.": "为了补充她的军团，扎里尔需要凡人的灵魂来创造莱姆雷，然后她可以将其提升为更高形式的魔鬼。她对收集物质世界中最伟大的战士的灵魂非常感兴趣。她讨价还价很厉害，几乎没有希望从契约中挣脱出来。然而，她期望从她的仆人那里得到最好的东西，所以她允许她的凡人追随者活出他们的生命，只要他们继续磨练他们的才能以提高他们的价值。因此，扎里尔的仆人普遍有效、有纪律，而且危险。",
