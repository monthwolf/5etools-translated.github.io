	"Animated coffins are heavy, macabre Constructs designed to ferry the dead to places of rest. They waddle the Mortuary's halls unbothered, scooping up corpses and carrying them to the next stage of the funerary process.": "动画棺材是沉重、阴森的构造体，设计用来将死者运送到安息之地。它们在殡仪馆的走廊上摇摇摆摆，毫不在意地捡起尸体，将它们运送到下一个葬礼程序的阶段。",
	"An animated coffin has an array of spidery metal legs it uses to skitter along steep inclines, walls, and ceilings, and the coffin's spacious interior bristles with retractable spikes. Like their inanimate counterparts, animated coffins range from plain wooden boxes with simple fittings to elaborate, gilded sarcophagi and reverent, fabric-lined caskets.": "一个动画棺材有一排蜘蛛般的金属腿，它用来在陡峭的斜坡、墙壁和天花板上蠕动，棺材宽敞的内部布满可伸缩的尖刺。与它们的非生物对应物一样，动画棺材的种类从简单配件的普通木盒到精美的镀金石棺和充满敬意的织物衬里棺材不等。",
	"Beyond the City of Doors, animated coffins serve similar—albeit less industrial—roles. Natural ambushers and tireless sentries, animated coffins guard ancient necropolises, family crypts, and the lairs of powerful Undead. A cautious vampire might sleep in an animated coffin to evade hunters during the day, while a necromancer might enlist animated coffins to conscript corpses from faraway settlements into an Undead army.": "在门户之城之外，动画棺材扮演着类似的——尽管不那么工业化——角色。作为天然伏击者和不知疲倦的哨兵，动画棺材守护着古老的墓地、家族墓穴以及强大不死生物的巢穴。一位谨慎的吸血鬼可能会选择在动画棺材中睡觉，以躲避白天的猎人，而一位死灵法师可能会利用动画棺材将远方定居点的尸体征召入不死军队。",
	"Animated coffins are rarely empty. The Animated Coffin Contents table presents some contents an animated coffin might contain when encountered.": "动画棺材很少是空的。在遇到时，动画棺材内容表格展示了一些可能包含的内容。",
	"{@dice 1d4} swarm of bats": "{@dice 1d4} 一群蝙蝠",
	"{@dice 1d4} skeletons packed like sardines": "{@dice 1d4} 骷髅像沙丁鱼一样密密麻麻地挤在一起",
	"A groaning mummy": "一具呻吟的木乃伊 (mummy)",
	"A patch of yellow mold (see the Dungeon Master's Guide)": "一片黄色霉菌（见《地牢主指南》）",
	"A slumbering vampire spawn": "一个沉睡的吸血鬼衍生物 (vampire spawn)",
	"A portal to the Path of Graves (detailed in Adventure Atlas: The Mortuary)": "通往墓穴之路的传送门（在《冒险地图集：太平间》中详细描述）",
	"Skall is the current factol of the Heralds of Dust and the only leader the faction has ever had. A popular Duster legend holds that other than the Lady of Pain herself, Skall is Sigil's oldest resident, the first creature to live and die in the City of Doors. The Heralds of Dust idolize their ageless factol, whose stoic visage has become the faction's emblem. Skall can usually be found examining his orrery of souls (detailed in {@i Adventure Atlas: The Mortuary}).": "Skall是尘埃使者(Heralds of Dust)的现任事实领袖，也是该派系迄今为止唯一的领导人。一则流传甚广的尘埃传说称，除了痛苦女士本人外，Skall是锡基尔(Sigil)最古老的居民，是第一个在门之城(City of Doors)生活和死去的生物。尘埃使者崇拜他们那位永恒不老的领袖，他那坚毅的面容已成为该派系的象征。Skall通常可以在研究他的灵魂八音盒(详见{@i Adventure Atlas: The Mortuary})时找到。",
	"After eons of existence, Skall is in an advanced state of deterioration. Once a spry lich with a wrinkled frame, he now drifts listlessly through the Mortuary's forlorn halls, rasping to himself. Skall appears as little more than a floating, disembodied head and two hands, his tattered cloak fluttering behind them. Notorious among the factols of Sigil but rarely seen in the flesh, Skall often delegates his bureaucratic responsibilities to Undead proxies or—on rare occasions—appears as an illusory duplicate. Subtle social cues are lost on the factol, whose eternal nature has eroded any memory of mortal life.": "经过无数年的存在，Skall已经处于一种先进的腐朽状态。曾经是一个身形皱巴巴的灵魂巫妖，他现在无精打采地漂浮在殡仪馆的荒凉大厅里，喃喃自语。Skall看起来只不过是一个漂浮的、无身体的头颅和两只手，他破烂的斗篷在他们身后飘动。Skall在锡基尔的事实领袖中臭名昭著，但很少亲眼见到他的真身，Skall经常将他的官僚责任委托给不死代理人，或者在罕见的情况下出现为一个幻影复制品。对于这位事实领袖来说，微妙的社交暗示已经失去了意义，他永恒的本质已经侵蚀了对凡人生活的任何记忆。",
	"As a result of his decay, Skall's power has waned considerably, but challenging him in combat is as much a death sentence as ever. Factol Skall imparts a lasting oblivion to his enemies. Caretaker, custodian, and grave keeper, the factol ushers allies and foes alike from this false existence toward the path to True Death.": "由于他的衰败，斯卡尔(Skall)的力量已大大减弱，但在战斗中挑战他仍然像以往一样是一种死刑。法克托尔·斯卡尔(Factol Skall)给他的敌人带来了永恒的遗忘。照料者，看守者和坟墓守护者，这位法克托尔将盟友和敌人一起从这个虚假的存在引向真正死亡的道路。",
	"Dauntless in the face of death, exorcists in the Heralds of Dust cleanse hapless creatures and resting places haunted by ghosts, specters, and other malign entities that prevent the dead from being interred or jeopardize those already in repose. Though most Duster exorcists conduct their operations in the Mortuary, many heed calls throughout Sigil and the planes beyond.": "在死亡面前毫不畏惧，尘埃使者中的驱魔师清洁那些被幽灵、幻影和其他邪恶实体所困扰的可怜生物和休憩之地，这些实体阻止了死者的安葬或危及已经长眠的人。虽然大多数尘埃使者的驱魔师在殡仪馆内进行操作，但也有许多人响应西格尔和其他位面的呼唤。",
	"The vagaries of undeath make spirits difficult to predict. Nevertheless, exorcists are well equipped for their work. Molded by experiences with apparitions and their ilk, exorcists channel the forces of death to preserve the living, commune with the dead, and drive evil spirits back to their graves. They can also fire versatile bolts of necrotic or radiant energy from their staves to repel a host of supernatural entities.": "不死之灵的变幻莫测，让它们难以预测。然而，驱魔师们为他们的工作做好了充分准备。通过与幽灵及其同类的经验塑造，驱魔师们引导死亡之力来保护生者，与亡者交流，并将邪恶灵魂驱逐回坟墓。他们还可以从法杖中发射多功能的死灵或光辉能量之弹，以驱逐各种超自然实体。",
	"An exorcist's senses pierce the veil of death to perceive wandering ghosts on the Ethereal Plane as well as shadow demons, wraiths, and other incorporeal entities hiding in palls of darkness. With a brief reboant chant, an exorcist can expunge a harmful entity from a possessed creature—or make that creature vulnerable to a painful spiritual inhabitation.": "一位驱魔师的感知力穿透死亡的面纱，能够感知以太位面中徘徊的幽灵，以及隐藏在黑暗中的暗影恶魔、幽灵和其他无实体的实体。通过一个简短的回响咒语，驱魔师可以驱除一个附身生物中的有害实体，或使该生物容易受到痛苦的精神寄居。"
