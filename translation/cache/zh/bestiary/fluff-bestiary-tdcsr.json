	"Each adranach has a unique mask crafted by its creator as their signature. This mask is crafted from pure mithral, and is the key to summoning and dismissing an adranach to a unique pocket dimension where it can rest and repair itself. When not in use, the mask magically shrinks from its true size to an easily concealable size fit for a humanoid face.

For while the latter recklessly wields fire as a weapon, firetamers use their talent to protect others from fire's destructive power—or wield that same power to destroy those who threaten their people.": "火驭者是(Pyrah)的精英元素使，利用他们对世界原始力量的调和，不仅仅是创造火焰，不仅仅是命令它，而是驯服它为己所用。(Pyrah)的火驭者与(Tal'Dorei)的狂热烈焰术士截然不同。因为后者肆意地将火焰作为武器，而火驭者利用他们的天赋保护他人免受火焰的破坏性力量，或者利用同样的力量摧毁那些威胁他们人民的敌人。",

When the kids went off to school (one to seminary, the other to {@book Westhall Academy in Westruun|TDCSR|3|2.

For the Vos'skyriss serpentfolk, worship is a means to an end. Their legends say that the devout will be granted the ability to devour nightmares, enabling them to gorge themselves on dreams of fear and terror until they grow so large that they can turn on their god and swallow the {@deity The Cloaked Serpent|Exandria|TDCSR|Cloaked Serpent} himself. Once begun, this feast is unending—they will devour the remaining gods one by one, and finally, the entirety of the multiverse.": "大多数蛇人对{@deity The Cloaked Serpent|Exandria|TDCSR|Cloaked Serpent}并无爱意，尽管他们尊奉他为毒药、刺客和黑暗之神。对于沃斯斯基瑞斯蛇人来说，崇拜只是达到目的的手段。他们的传说称，虔诚者将被赋予吞噬噩梦的能力，使他们能够大快朵颐恐惧和恐怖的梦境，直到变得如此庞大，可以反击他们的神并吞下{@deity The Cloaked Serpent|Exandria|TDCSR|Cloaked Serpent}本尊。一旦开始，这场盛宴将永无止境——他们将一个接一个地吞噬剩下的众神，最终，吞噬整个多元宇宙。",
	"Several decades ago, Jorlund Vohr, professor of archaeology at the {@book Alabaster Lyceum|TDCSR|3|5. Alabaster Lyceum}, led an expedition to the ruins upon {@book Visa Isle|TDCSR|3|Visa Isle}—and found them prowled by the restless spirits of the serpent empire. Their incursion unleashed these entombed spirits, and awakened hundreds of their living kin from magical stasis. Now, living and undead serpentfolk plot together to rekindle the embers of their long-lost empire.": "几十年前，{@book Alabaster Lyceum|TDCSR|3|5. Alabaster Lyceum}考古学教授乔伦德·沃尔（Jorlund Vohr）带领一支探险队前往{@book Visa Isle|TDCSR|3|Visa Isle}的废墟——发现那里游荡着蛇族帝国的不安灵魂。他们的入侵释放了这些被埋葬的灵魂，并唤醒了数百名被魔法封印的活着的同族。现在，活着的和不死的蛇人一起密谋重燃他们失落已久帝国的余烬。",
	"Heroes. Scoundrels. Legends. Dumbasses. The legacy of the adventuring party Vox Machina is a complicated one. Over the course of their adventures, they've selflessly saved the lives of thousands of people in Tal'Dorei, {@book Wildemount|TDCSR|3|Wildemount}, {@book Issylra|TDCSR|3|Issylra}, and beyond. Of course, there are also countless tales of individuals they've bullied, threatened, insulted, or otherwise needlessly antagonized throughout those same adventures. These legendary figures grew from a band of dime-a-dozen sellswords in the swamp burgh of {@book Stilben|TDCSR|3|Stilben} to gods-blessed warriors whose actions might have saved all of Exandria from a future of undead tyranny.": "英雄。恶棍。传奇。蠢货。冒险者队伍Vox Machina的传奇是一个复杂的故事。在他们的冒险过程中，他们无私地拯救了塔尔多雷（Tal'Dorei）、{@book Wildemount|TDCSR|3|Wildemount}、{@book Issylra|TDCSR|3|Issylra}以及更远的地方成千上万人的生命。当然，在这些冒险中，也有无数关于他们欺凌、威胁、侮辱或其他不必要挑衅个人的故事。这些传奇人物从一个在{@book Stilben|TDCSR|3|Stilben}沼泽小镇的普通雇佣兵团成长为被神祝福的战士，他们的行动可能拯救了整个Exandria免受不死暴政的未来。",
	"The deeds of Vox Machina are sung by bards across Tal'Dorei, often exaggerating those already belief-defying tales of gods and monsters and magic. But though their legend has grown wild and unruly, the members of Vox Machina are still people. More than twenty years have passed since their last great campaign. Most of them are still alive, and the lives of these heroes have changed—in big ways and in smaller, more subtle ones.": "Vox Machina的事迹被巴德们在塔尔多雷吟唱，往往夸大那些本已令人难以置信的有关神灵、怪物和魔法的传说。但尽管他们的传奇变得狂野且难以控制，Vox Machina的成员依然是凡人。自从他们最后一次伟大的冒险已经过去二十多年。他们中的大多数人依然健在，这些英雄的生活发生了变化——无论是在重大方面还是在更微小、更微妙的方面。",
	"Those among them who age have softer bodies and lines on their faces. Those among them who don't age still show the weight of the world upon their shoulders. By and large, the members of Vox Machina have set aside weapons, armor, and spells in favor of more subtle ways of helping others. Some lead the lands they were born to lead. Others have been elected to the {@book Tal'Dorei Council|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council}, shaping the fate of the continent's people with quiet wisdom rather than blades and battle cries.": "他们中年龄较大的人身体柔软，脸上有皱纹。而那些不显老的人仍然肩负着世界的重担。总的来说，Vox Machina的成员们放下了武器、盔甲和法术，转而采用更微妙的方式来帮助他人。有些人领导着他们出生的土地。其他人已经被选为{@book Tal'Dorei Council|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council}，用安静的智慧而不是刀剑和战吼来塑造大陆人民的命运。",
	"Still, each member of this legendary band of adventurers would take up arms again in an instant if it meant protecting those they care for the most. And the {@table Vestiges of Divergence by Advancement|TDCSR|Vestiges of Divergence}, whose power they unlocked in the battles against the {@book Cinder King|TDCSR|1|Thordak, the Cinder King} and {@deity The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR}, are still within their grasp.": "然而，这支传奇冒险者团队的每个成员如果意味着保护他们最在乎的人，他们会立即再次拿起武器。而在与{@book Cinder King|TDCSR|1|Thordak, the Cinder King}和{@deity The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR}的战斗中解锁的{@table Vestiges of Divergence by Advancement|TDCSR|Vestiges of Divergence}的力量仍然掌握在他们手中。",
	"The following stat blocks are here for GMs to use if their players encounter a member of Vox Machina—hopefully as an ally or a \"quest giver,\" for woe betide anyone who encounters these legendary heroes as a foe. These statistics don't represent the full extent of the characters' abilities as 20th-level adventurers, but have been streamlined to make them easier for the Game Master to run.": "以下的属性块供GM使用，如果他们的玩家遇到了Vox Machina的成员，希望他们是盟友或“任务提供者”，因为遇到这些传奇英雄作为敌人的人是不幸的。这些统计数据并不代表这些角色作为20级冒险者的全部能力，而是经过简化以便于游戏主持人运行。",
	"When ancient or nefarious entities need to safeguard objects of grave consequence—particularly items intertwined with their immortality—they bury those secrets alongside wraithroot trees, around which the people of Exandria dare not tread.": "当古老或邪恶的实体需要保护与其永生紧密相连的重要物品时，它们会将这些秘密埋藏在幽灵根树旁，而艾克桑德里亚的人们不敢靠近这些树。",
	"Wraithroot trees are the product of foul necromancy and transmutation rituals that first see a tree awakened, gifting it with advanced intelligence and imbuing its roots with mobility. But the {@creature awakened tree||awakened tree's} first moments of joyous awareness are tragically cut short as necromantic energy courses through it, channeling rage and evil to transform it into a wraithroot—filled with longing to obliterate the life it so fleetingly enjoyed.": "鬼根树是邪恶死灵术和转化仪式的产物，首先使一棵树苏醒，赋予它先进的智慧，并赋予其根部移动能力。但是，{@creature awakened tree||awakened tree's} 最初的喜悦意识瞬间被残忍地打断，因为死灵能量贯穿其中，引导愤怒和邪恶，将其转化为鬼根——充满了摧毁它曾经稍纵即逝的生命的渴望。",
	"In Tal'Dorei, wraithroots can be found in a number of locations, including the {@book Parchwood Timberlands|TDCSR|3|Parchwood Timberlands} below {@book Whitestone|TDCSR|3|Whitestone}, the {@book Torian Forest|TDCSR|3|Torian Forest} along the southwestern edge of the {@book Cliffkeep Mountains|TDCSR|3|Cliffkeep Mountains}, the {@book Grey Valley|TDCSR|3|Grey Valley} north of {@book Kraghammer|TDCSR|3|Kraghammer}, and the Moldered Grove southeast of the Ashkeeper Peaks.": "在塔尔多雷（Tal'Dorei），幽魂根可以在许多地方找到，包括{@book Parchwood Timberlands|TDCSR|3|Parchwood Timberlands}下方的{@book Whitestone|TDCSR|3|Whitestone}，沿着西南边缘的{@book Torian Forest|TDCSR|3|Torian Forest}，{@book Cliffkeep Mountains|TDCSR|3|Cliffkeep Mountains}北部的{@book Grey Valley|TDCSR|3|Grey Valley}，以及灰守峰东南的腐烂树丛（Moldered Grove）。"
