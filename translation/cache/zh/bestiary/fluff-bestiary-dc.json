	"Over a thousand years ago, the black dragon Chardansearavitriol, commonly known as Ebondeath, settled in the Mere of Dead Men, making his lair in the ruined citadel of Uthtower. Ebondeath became a dracolich and was worshiped by the Cult of the Dragon until the death god Myrkul's influence waned across Faerûn and the dragon's bones turned to dust.": "一千多年前，黑龙Chardansearavitriol，通常被称为Ebondeath，在死人谷定居，在废墟中的Uthtower城堡中筑巢。Ebondeath成为了一个龙人，并被龙的崇拜者所崇拜，直到死亡之神Myrkul在整个Faerûn的影响力减弱，龙的骨头变成了灰尘。"
