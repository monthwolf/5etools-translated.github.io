	"Priests bring the teachings of their gods to the common folk. They are the spiritual leaders of temples and shrines and often hold positions of influence in their communities. Evil priests might work openly under a tyrant, or they might be the leaders of religious sects hidden in the shadows of good society, overseeing depraved rites. A priest typically has one or more acolytes to help with religious ceremonies and other sacred duties.": "祭司将他们的神的教义带给普通人。他们是寺庙和神殿的精神领袖，通常在社区中拥有影响力。邪恶的祭司可能在暴君手下公开工作，也可能是隐藏在良好社会阴影下的宗教派别的领袖，监督堕落的仪式。牧师通常有一个或多个徒弟来帮助完成宗教仪式和其他神圣的职责。",
	"Onyx cannot be overcome or killed by combat. Any weapon attack against her that hits AC 12 makes contact but deals no lasting damage. However, if the attack would deal 10 or more damage, Onyx has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of her next turn. If Onyx would take 10 or more damage from spells or other effects, it yields the same result. Spells that impose conditions function normally against Onyx, but those conditions end automatically at the end of the cat's next turn.": "奥尼克斯不能被战斗所战胜或杀死。任何针对她的武器攻击，只要击中AC12，就会产生接触，但不会造成持久的伤害。然而，如果攻击会造成10或更多的伤害，Onyx在攻击卷轴上有劣势，直到她下一个回合结束。如果Onyx会从法术或其他效果中受到10或更多的伤害，会产生同样的结果。施加条件的法术对Onyx的作用是正常的，但这些条件在猫的下一回合结束时自动结束。",
	"Rulers, nobles, merchants, guildmasters, and other wealthy individuals use spies to gain the upper hand in a world of cutthroat politics. A spy is trained to secretly gather information. Loyal spies would rather die than divulge information that could compromise them or their employers.": "统治者、贵族、商人、行会会长和其他富有的人利用间谍在这个残酷的政治世界中取得优势。间谍接受的训练是为了秘密收集信息。忠诚的间谍宁死也不会泄露可能危及他们或其雇主的信息。"
