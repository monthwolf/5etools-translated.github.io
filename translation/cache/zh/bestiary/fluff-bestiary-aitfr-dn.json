	"These enormous, rotten husks were living, Medium-sized constrictors when the yuan-ti brought them to honor and entice Kyrilla to share her knowledge and powers. They grew to their full, Huge size on a diet of supplicants and prisoners, many of whose bones can be found elsewhere in the lair. When the yuan-ti turned against Kyrilla, they fought and slew these snakes—only to find them slithering again through cursed, ambient magic in Kyrilla's lair.": "这些巨大的、腐烂的外壳是活生生的、中等大小的缢杀者，当时元老们带着它们来纪念和诱惑Kyrilla分享她的知识和力量。它们以祈求者和囚犯为食，长成了巨大的体型，其中许多人的骨头在巢穴的其他地方都能找到。当元老们反对Kyrilla时，他们与这些蛇战斗并杀死了它们--但却发现它们在Kyrilla的巢穴中通过受诅咒的环境魔法再次滑行。",
	"The constrictors die if they leave the lair.": "缢杀者如果离开巢穴就会死亡。",
	"A gentle giant with a ferocious laugh, Hamish hails from the city of Waterdeep. He was never one for the wilderness in his younger days, but he wanted adventure. He joined his friends, Sylvene and Artura, on their journey into the wilds of the Sword Coast, all those years ago, and was part of their adventuring party with a human from Secomber named Waltarn Everlake. That Hamish would be willing to risk his life to protect his friends was never in doubt.": "哈米什是一个温柔的巨人，有着凶猛的笑声，他来自沃特迪普城。在他年轻的时候，他从来不是一个喜欢荒野的人，但他想要冒险。多年前，他加入了他的朋友希尔维尼和阿图拉的旅程，进入了剑海岸的荒野，和一个来自塞康伯的人类一起成为了他们冒险队伍的一员，他的名字叫沃坦恩-艾弗莱克。哈米什愿意冒着生命危险保护他的朋友，这一点从未受到怀疑。",
	"Hamish has brown skin, great posture, and wears his long hair in three tidy braids. He is the sort of fellow who overpacks for an adventure. His pockets usually teem with snacks or rations. Being a giant, he brought both a dungeoneer's pack and an explorer's pack in his knapsack. He carries a big axe, suitable for his size. He also carried a round, wooden shield, made just for him by Artura, but it has rotted to bits.": "哈米什拥有棕色皮肤，姿态优美，将长发梳成三个整齐的辫子。他是那种为冒险而超量打包的人。他的口袋里通常装满了零食或口粮。作为一个巨人，他的背包里同时带了一个地下工作者的包和一个探险家的包。他携带一把大斧头，适合他的体型。他还带着一面圆形的木质盾牌，是阿图拉专门为他做的，但已经腐烂成了碎片。",
	"\"I am curious about the road not taken, sometimes to a fault. I try to always have food with me.\"": "\"我对没有走过的路很好奇，有时甚至是一种错误。我试图总是带着食物\"。",
	"\"Bravery. I would risk my life for true friends. In fact, I have!\"": "\"勇敢。我愿意为真正的朋友冒生命危险。事实上，我已经做到了！\"",
	"\"Friendships you choose can mean more than family. A friend made is an enemy defeated.\"": "\"你选择的友谊可能比家庭更有意义。结交的朋友就是打败的敌人\"。",
	"\"I often believe in people to the point of being naive.\"": "\"我经常相信人，以至于天真无邪。\"",
	"Some small part of Kyrilla hopes she might be pardoned from her immortal curse one day, but her ire and spite have overtaken her heart, and the only way she can imagine escaping eternity is by impressing the gods with her tenacity. She doesn't want pity nor compassion. She wants to be feared and loathed and to press on with existence despite it all. And now that Kathikon is dead and she is alone, she cannot remember mercy.": "Kyrilla的某些小部分希望她有一天能从她的不朽诅咒中得到赦免，但她的愤怒和怨恨已经超越了她的心，她能想象的逃离永恒的唯一方法是用她的顽强打动众神。她不想要怜悯，也不想要同情。她想让人害怕和厌恶，并不顾一切地继续生存下去。而现在，卡西孔已经死了，她独自一人，她不记得怜悯。",
	"\"I am quick to judge others and find them wanting.\"": "\"我很快就会评判别人，发现他们不合格\"。",
	"\"Spite. I survive despite a curse from the gods—I'm not about to go out into the world where fools will try to kill me.\"": "\"怨恨。尽管有神的诅咒，我还是活了下来--我不打算到外面的世界去，那里的傻瓜会试图杀死我。\"",
	"\"Kathikon was the love of my life. No one else matters to me.\"": "\"Kathikon是我一生的挚爱。其他任何人对我来说都不重要。\"",
	"\"I never admit when I am wrong.\"": "\"我从不承认我的错误。\"",
	"Once, Kyrilla looked much like other gorgons of her world. Now, with her curse upon her, Kyrilla's healthy greenish skin has grown sickly pale, and the segmented cables she wore like hair have gone from shiny black to matte gray and green. Her legs became a long, segmented tail. Her eyes now glow green, bright enough to create dim light in front of her. She has grown four needle-like fangs in her mouth, and her hands have become slicing claws.": "曾经，Kyrilla看起来很像她所在世界的其他高竿。现在，在她的诅咒下，Kyrilla健康的绿色皮肤变得病态的苍白，她像头发一样戴着的分段式电缆已经从闪亮的黑色变成了哑光的灰色和绿色。她的腿变成了一条长长的、分段的尾巴。她的眼睛现在发出绿色的光芒，明亮到足以在她面前形成昏暗的光线。她的嘴里长出了四根针状的獠牙，她的手也变成了切片的爪子。",
	"She reverts to her original appearance when she dies.": "她死后会恢复到她原来的样子。",
	"The malevolent powers bestowed to Kyrilla by her curse, as well as those given to her by the yuan-ti cult, are hardly of interest to her. She doesn't relish power but instead has taken to wallowing in misery and dwelling in her hatred for the beings that cursed her so long ago that she can hardly remember them.": "她的诅咒所赋予Kyrilla的恶性力量，以及元老会赋予她的恶性力量，对她来说几乎没有兴趣。她不喜欢权力，而是沉浸在痛苦中，沉浸在对那些很久以前诅咒她的人的仇恨中，以至于她几乎记不起他们。",
	"Kyrilla wears a ring of water walking that she was given by an emissary from the Serpent Kingdoms long ago. It is made of a bluish jade and does not reflect light.": "Kyrilla戴着一枚水行戒指，这是很久以前一位来自蛇国的使者送给她的。它由淡蓝色的玉石制成，不反射光线。",
	"Kyrilla does not require food or drink but does breathe and sleep.": "Kyrilla不需要食物或饮料，但需要呼吸和睡眠。",
	"This horrid mass of bones clambers along on a dozen hands and feet without maintaining any consistent shape. One moment it moves like a centipede, the next it rears back to claw like a bear. The only consistent feature is a weird absence: no matter how many skulls make up its mass, this strange horror always seems to be headless.": "这块可怕的骨头在十几只手和脚上爬行，没有保持任何一致的形状。一会儿它像蜈蚣一样移动，一会儿它又像熊一样向后张牙舞爪。唯一一致的特征是一个奇怪的缺失：无论有多少头骨组成它的质量，这个奇怪的恐怖似乎总是没有头。",
	"The skeletal horrors in Kyrilla's lair are made from the bones of yuan-ti supplicants and cultists who came to learn her powers or, later, to steal them. She spared none of these intruders' lives, and in death their remains do her bidding.": "克里拉巢穴中的骷髅恐怖是由前来学习她的力量或后来偷窃她的力量的元神祈求者和邪教徒的骨头制成的。她不放过这些入侵者的生命，在他们死后，他们的遗体为她服务。"
