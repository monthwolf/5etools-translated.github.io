	"Deep in the desert, far from the protection of the Hekma and the safety of Naktamun, lies a place called Ifnir, the Demons' Nest. The people of Amonkhet believe that the God-Pharaoh banished all the demons of this plane to the desolation of Ifnir as punishment when they rose up in rebellion against him. Some say that the angels carry the worst dissenters into the heart of Ifnir, which is a fate far worse than merely being abandoned amid the scouring sands.": "在沙漠深处，远离赫克马的保护和纳克塔蒙的安全，有一个叫做伊夫尼尔的地方，即恶魔之巢。阿蒙凯特的人们相信，神-法老将这个位面的所有恶魔放逐到伊夫尼尔的荒芜之地，作为对他们起义的惩罚。有些人说，天使将最严重的异议者带入伊夫尼尔的中心，这比仅仅被遗弃在冲刷的沙地上的命运要糟糕得多。",
	"The demons of Ifnir bear some resemblance to Bolas, with long limbs and tails, huge wings, and gaunt bodies adorned with horns and blades. Other demonic creatures have more bestial features, including {@creature ammit|PSA|ammits}—crocodilian demons sometimes used as challenges within the trials of the five gods—and the scorpion demons called {@creature soulstinger demon|PSA|soulstingers}, whose venom causes excruciating pain in its victims.": "伊夫尼尔的恶魔与博拉斯有些相似，有长长的四肢和尾巴，巨大的翅膀，以及装饰有角和刀刃的憔悴身体。其他恶魔生物具有更多的兽性特征，包括{@creature ammit|PSA|ammits}--有时被用作五神审判中的挑战，以及被称为{@creature soulstinger demon|PSA|soulstingers}的蝎子恶魔，其毒液会给受害者带来极大的痛苦。",
	"Dragons are fierce monsters with heavy reptilian bodies, crocodilian heads, and leathery wings, and are dis-tinguished by their ability to breathe fire. Though Nicol Bolas is also a dragon, he feels no kinship for these savage, dim-witted beasts. They live mostly in the remote reaches of the desert, soaring in lazy circles through the sky as they search for prey. Sometimes they are captured and brought inside the Hekma, where they are put to use within the trials of the five gods—especially in the climactic battles of the final Trial of Zeal.": "龙是一种凶猛的怪物，有着沉重的爬行动物的身体、鳄鱼的头和皮质的翅膀，并因其能够喷火而与众不同。虽然尼科尔-博拉斯也是龙，但他对这些野蛮的、愚蠢的野兽并不感到亲近。它们主要生活在沙漠的偏远地区，在天空中懒洋洋地盘旋，寻找猎物。有时它们被捕获并带入希克玛，在那里它们被用于五神的审判--特别是在最后的狂热审判的高潮战斗中。",
	"The hydra is a reptilian horror with a crocodilian body and multiple heads on long, serpentine necks. Although its heads can be severed, the hydra magically regrows them in short order. A typical specimen has five heads. At the dawn of time, {@deity Tiamat|dawn war|dmg}, the Queen of Evil Dragons, slew a rival dragon god named Lernaea and cast her blood across the multiverse. Each drop that fell upon a world spawned a multi-headed hydra consumed by a hunger as great as the fallen god's hatred. Great champions are known to test their mettle against these fearsome creatures.": "九头蛇是一种恐怖的爬行动物，拥有鳄鱼般的身体和长长的蛇形脖子上的多个头。虽然它的头可以被砍掉，但九头蛇会在短时间内神奇地重新长出头来。一个典型的标本有五个头。在时间的黎明，{@deity Tiamat|dawn war|dmg}，恶龙的女王，杀死了一个名叫Lernaea的对手龙神，并将她的血投向整个多元宇宙。每一滴落在一个世界上都会产生一个多头的九头蛇，它被一种与堕落之神的仇恨一样巨大的饥饿感所吞噬。众所周知，伟大的冠军们会在这些可怕的生物面前测试他们的能力。",
	"The desolate wilderness beyond the protection of the Hekma is largely uncharted. Immediately beyond the protective veil is a chaotic dune sea called Shefet, the Scouring Sands. The desert wears away at the edges of the fertile lands surrounding Naktamun, serving as a constant reminder that only the bounty and protection of the God-Pharaoh stand between the people of the city-state and a grisly death in the sands beyond. Beyond Shefet are parched, cracked expanses called Ramunap, the Broken Lands. The ruins of ancient civilizations are said to lie in the Broken Lands, though no one has ever explored such ruins and returned to Naktamun to tell of them.": "在赫克马的保护范围之外的荒凉旷野，基本上是无人知晓的。紧邻保护面纱的是一片混乱的沙丘海，被称为 \"Shefet\"，即 \"冲刷的沙子\"。沙漠侵蚀着纳克塔蒙周围肥沃土地的边缘，不断提醒人们，只有上帝-法老的赏赐和保护，才能让城邦的人民在沙地上惨遭杀害。在Shefet之外，是被称为Ramunap（破碎之地）的干涸、开裂的大片土地。古代文明的遗迹据说就在破碎之地，尽管从来没有人探索过这些遗迹并回到纳克塔蒙讲述它们。",
	"A rapacious and gluttonous monster, a hydra snatches and tears apart its prey in a frenzy of feeding. When a hydra has cleared a territory of food and driven off any creatures smart enough to avoid it, it moves on to seek its meals elsewhere. A hydra's hunger is so great that if it can't feed, it might turn against itself, its heads attacking each other as the creature eats itself alive.": "九头蛇是一种贪婪和贪吃的怪物，它在狂热的进食中抢夺并撕碎它的猎物。当九头蛇清除了一个地区的食物，并赶走了任何足够聪明的生物，以避免它，它继续寻找其他地方的食物。九头蛇的饥饿感是如此之强，以至于如果它不能进食，它可能会自相残杀，当它活生生地吃掉自己的时候，它的头会互相攻击。",
	"Hydras are natural swimmers, dwelling in rivers, along lakeshores, in ocean shallows, and in wetland bogs. A hydra rarely requires shelter from the elements, so it doesn't normally have a lair. Only in colder climes are hydras drawn to the protection of sheltered caverns and ruins. When a hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads remains awake and alert, making the creature difficult to catch by surprise.": "水螅是天然的游泳者，居住在河流、湖岸、海洋浅滩和湿地沼泽中。水螅很少需要避风的地方，所以它通常没有巢穴。只有在较冷的气候下，水螅才会被吸引到有保护的洞穴和废墟中。当水螅睡觉时，它至少有一个头保持清醒和警惕，这使得它很难被突然抓住。",
	"Fortunately, the beneficence of the God-Pharaoh is great enough to provide a role for these people. Called the anointed, they are carefully embalmed, protected from the Curse of Wandering, and allowed to spend another lifetime in service to the worthy. The God-Pharaoh promises that those who faithfully serve as the anointed will earn a place as attendants in the afterlife as well, and even an eternity of service in the afterlife is prefera-ble to an eternity subjected to the Curse of Wandering.": "幸运的是，上帝-法老的仁慈足以为这些人提供一个角色。他们被称为受膏者，被小心翼翼地防腐，免受流浪的诅咒，并被允许用另一个一生来为有价值的人服务。神-法老承诺，那些忠实于受膏者的人在来世也会获得一个侍者的位置，甚至在来世服务的永恒也比受流浪诅咒的永恒要好。",
	"The bodies of the anointed are carefully wrapped in cloth and adorned with cartouches. In contrast to the cartouches of {@background initiate|PSA|initiates} and {@background vizier|PSA|viziers}, these do not harbor the life essence of the deceased at their best. Instead, they coach the anointed for a particular form of service. With their cartouches in place, the anointed rise and join the ranks of serving {@creature amonkhet mummy|PSA|mummies} who attend to the needs of daily life in Amonkhet.": "受膏者的尸体被小心翼翼地用布包裹起来，并饰以卡图。与{@background initiate|PSA|initiates}和{@background vizier|PSA|viziers}的卡图相比，这些卡图并不包含死者最佳的生命本质。相反，他们指导受膏者进行特定形式的服务。受膏者有了卡图后，就可以加入到为阿蒙凯特的日常生活服务的{@creature amonkhet mummy|PSA|mummies}队伍中去。",
	"The Curse of Wandering is the greatest danger of the desert lands. A creature killed in the desert rises again as a {@creature zombie} as soon as the moisture has dried from its flesh. As a result, the corpses of every kind of desert creature shamble across the dunes alongside the humanoid {@creature zombie||zombies} of {@background dissenter|PSA|dissenters} and would-be explorers. Most of these former humanoids are mindless marauders, though some tales speak of {@creature amonkhet mummy|PSA|mummies} that have retained a sinister intelligence and even magical ability, becoming {@creature amonkhet mummy lord|PSA|mummy lords}.": "漫游的诅咒是沙漠地带最大的危险。在沙漠中被杀死的生物，一旦其肉体上的水分干涸，就会重新复活为{@creature zombie}。因此，每一种沙漠生物的尸体都会在沙丘上晃动，与{@background dissenter|PSA|dissenters}的人形{@creature zombie||zombies}和可能的探险者一起晃动。这些曾经的人形生物大多是无意识的掠夺者，不过有些传说中的{@creature amonkhet mummy|PSA|mummies}保留了邪恶的智慧，甚至是魔法能力，成为{@creature amonkhet mummy lord|PSA|mummy lords}。",
	"Sphinxes are inscrutable beings, and keepers of secrets and mysteries. They have leonine bodies, hawklike wings, and faces resembling humans, framed by great frills or manes of feathers. Their powerful forearms are also feathered, and fans of long feathers form their tails.": "斯芬克斯是难以捉摸的生物，是秘密和神秘的守护者。他们有瘦长的身体，鹰一样的翅膀，脸部类似于人类，被巨大的褶皱或羽毛的鬃毛所包围。他们强大的前臂也有羽毛，长长的羽毛扇构成他们的尾巴。",
	"The sphinxes of Amonkhet are perhaps the only creatures to remain uncorrupted by the influence of Nicol Bolas on this plane. Their impenetrable minds proved to be beyond even Bolas's ability to control—but even so, he was able to place them under a curse to guarantee their silence. A sphinx is utterly incapable of communication—verbal or nonverbal, even written—as long as the curse remains in effect. In this way, Bolas has prevented the sphinxes from revealing his system of lies to the people or gods of Naktamun.": "阿蒙凯特的狮身人面像也许是这个星球上唯一没有被尼科尔-博拉斯的影响所侵蚀的生物。他们坚不可摧的思想甚至被证明是博拉斯无法控制的--但即便如此，他还是能够将他们置于一个诅咒之下，以保证他们的沉默。只要诅咒仍然有效，狮身人面像就完全无法进行交流--口头的或非口头的，甚至是书面的。通过这种方式，博拉斯阻止了狮身人面像向纳克塔蒙的人民或神明透露他的谎言体系。",
	"Whatever their original forms might have been, the angels of Amonkhet have been twisted into distorted reflections of Nicol Bolas. Their limbs are long and thin, with elongated shins and forearms. Their huge wings are adorned with white and black feathers. Light shines through their joints and chests as if from an internal fire, and their eyes glow with a gold or orange light.": "无论他们的原始形态是什么，阿蒙凯特的天使已经被扭曲成了尼科尔-博拉斯的扭曲反映。他们的四肢又长又细，胫骨和前臂都被拉长了。他们巨大的翅膀上装饰着白色和黑色的羽毛。光线穿过他们的关节和胸部，仿佛来自内部的火焰，他们的眼睛发出金色或橙色的光芒。",
	"Cerodons are sometimes mistaken for herbivores because of their resemblance to bulls, but they are never mistaken for harmless. They stand over thirty feet tall at the shoulder, and their heads are crowned with enormous horns that jut forward from the nose, then extend backward almost the entire length of their bodies. The horn structure resembles a sandstone cliff, and a cerodon can use it to ruin buildings or monuments with a minimum of effort. Cerodons are extremely aggressive, and often mistake the shimmering Hekma for an intruder into their territory.": "Cerodons有时会被误认为是食草动物，因为它们与公牛很相似，但它们绝不会被误认为是无害的。它们肩高超过30英尺，头顶有巨大的角，从鼻子向前突出，然后几乎向后延伸到身体的整个长度。角的结构类似于砂岩悬崖，Cerodon可以用它来破坏建筑物或纪念碑，而不费吹灰之力。角龙的攻击性极强，常常把闪闪发光的海克玛误认为是闯入它们领地的人。",

	"Drakes are similar to dragons, though they lack any ability to breathe fire and have only two legs in addi-tion to their huge wings. They are less aggressive than dragons, and possibly slightly more intelligent. They are drawn by the glint of lazotep in mines, the shine of gold in Naktamun, and the glimmer of the sun on the water of the Luxa river. They also like to perch on obelisks and other spires on city buildings.": "德拉克斯与龙相似，尽管它们没有任何喷火的能力，而且除了巨大的翅膀外，只有两条腿。它们没有龙那么好斗，而且可能稍微聪明一些。它们被矿井中闪烁的拉索特普、纳克塔蒙的黄金光泽以及卢克萨河水上的太阳光芒所吸引。它们也喜欢栖息在方尖碑和城市建筑的其他尖顶上。",
	"Fortunately, the beneficence of the God-Pharaoh is great enough to provide a role for these people. Called the {@creature anointed|PSA}, they are carefully embalmed, protected from the Curse of Wandering, and allowed to spend another lifetime in service to the worthy.

	"A being as mighty and magnificent as Nicol Bolas demands a fighting force of the highest caliber, so that an ordinary army of zombies could never be worthy of the God-Pharaoh. The Eternals are elite soldiers with all the skill and prowess of living soldiers, but none of the disadvantages that arise in living beings, such as emotions, hesitation, or disloyalty. Bolas has personally crafted all of Amonkhet to create just such an army.": "像尼科尔-博拉斯这样强大而壮丽的存在，需要一支最高水准的战斗部队，因此，一支普通的僵尸军队永远无法配得上神-法老。永恒者是精英士兵，拥有活人士兵的所有技能和能力，但没有活人身上出现的缺点，如情感、犹豫不决或不忠诚。博拉斯亲手打造了整个阿蒙凯特，就是为了创造这样一支军队。",
	"Manticores are catlike creatures with feline bodies, tails like those of {@creature scorpion||scorpions}, and chitinous plates on their lower legs and feet. The venom of their tail stingers is the most virulent poison known on Amonkhet, and they can sting with lightning speed even while tearing at a foe with claws and teeth. Their deadliness makes them prized for use in the Trial of Zeal, where they grant glorified deaths to many initiates.": "刺尾狮是一种猫科动物，有着猫科动物的身体，尾巴像{@creature scorpion||scorpions}，小腿和脚上有壳质板。它们尾巴上的毒刺是阿蒙凯特已知的最剧烈的毒药，即使在用爪子和牙齿撕咬敌人的时候，它们也能以闪电般的速度刺痛敌人。它们的致命性使它们在 \"狂热审判 \"中受到珍视，在那里它们给许多入会者带来荣耀的死亡。",
	"The Luxa river is an abundant source of life, fertilizing the lush valley around Naktamun and providing water to humanoids and animals alike. It is also a vibrant habitat for countless creatures, including many species of birds, fish, and frogs. {@creature crocodile||Crocodiles} and {@creature hippopotamus|PSA|hippopotamuses} can be a danger to boats and barges, but perhaps the most feared denizens of the river are the {@creature giant river serpent|PSA|giant serpents} known to lurk near its bottom. When roused to anger, they can sink fishing boats by the dozens and flood the shore.": "卢萨河是一个丰富的生命之源，它使纳克塔蒙周围郁郁葱葱的山谷肥沃起来，为人类和动物提供水。它也是无数生物充满活力的栖息地，包括许多种鸟类、鱼类和青蛙。{@creature crocodile||Crocodiles}和{@creature hippopotamus|PSA|hippopotamuses}会对船只和驳船造成危险，但也许最令人恐惧的是潜伏在河底的{@creature giant river serpent|PSA|giant serpents}。当它们被激怒时，可以击沉几十艘渔船并淹没海岸。",
	"Serpopards are strange felines with serpentine features, including long, flexible bodies, venomous fangs, and sensitive tongues they can use to detect the scent of prey from a great distance. They like to perch in trees near desert oases or along the Luxa river, inside the Hekma, to drop down on creatures that come near the water.": "蛇豹是一种具有蛇形特征的奇怪猫科动物，包括长而灵活的身体、毒牙和敏感的舌头，它们可以用来从很远的地方探测猎物的气味。它们喜欢栖息在沙漠绿洲附近的树上，或沿着赫克马河内的卢克萨河，对靠近水面的生物落井下石。"
