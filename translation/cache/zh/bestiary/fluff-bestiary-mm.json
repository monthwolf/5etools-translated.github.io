	"Aarakocra range the Howling Gyre, an endless storm of mighty winds and lashing rains that surrounds the tranquil realm of Aaqa in the Elemental Plane of Air. Making aerial patrols, these birdlike humanoids guard the windy borders of their home against invaders from the Elemental Plane of Earth, such as gargoyles, their sworn enemies.": "Aarakocra的活动范围是咆哮环流，这是一场无尽的风暴，由强大的风和猛烈的雨组成，环绕着空气元素界的宁静的Aaqa境界。在空中巡逻时，这些鸟类人形生物守护着他们家园多风的边界，防止来自地球元素界的入侵者，比如他们的死敌--巨妖。",
	"In service to the Wind Dukes of Aaqa, aarakocra scout the planes in search of temples of Elemental Evil. They spy on malign elemental creatures and then either take the fight to those creatures or report back to the Wind Dukes.": "在为Aaqa的风之公爵服务时，Aarakocra在各星球上寻找元素邪恶的神庙。他们监视着邪恶的元素生物，然后要么与这些生物战斗，要么向风公爵报告。",
	"On the Material Plane, aarakocra create aeries atop the highest mountains, especially peaks near portals to the Elemental Plane of Air. From such heights, aarakocra watch for signs of elemental incursions, as well as for nascent threats to their home plane. Aarakocra prefer to live their lives like the wind-unburdened and ever moving-yet they watch over a region for years if that's what it takes to guard against the incursions of Elemental Evil.": "在物质界，阿拉科克拉在最高的山峰上建立了一个空洞，特别是在通往空气元素界的门户附近的山峰。在这样的高度上，阿拉科克拉人观察着元素入侵的迹象，以及对他们的母体世界的新生威胁。Aarakocra更喜欢像风一样生活--没有负担和不断移动--但他们会监视一个地区很多年，如果这是为了防止元素邪恶的入侵。",
	"Aarakocra have no concept of political borders or property ownership, and the value of gems, gold, and other precious materials means little to aarakocra. In their eyes, a creature should use what is necessary and then cast what is left on the wind for others to use.": "Aarakocra没有政治边界或财产所有权的概念，宝石、黄金和其他珍贵材料的价值对Aarakocra来说意义不大。在他们眼里，一个生物应该使用必要的东西，然后把剩下的东西扔到风中供别人使用。",
	"Five aarakocra within 30 feet of each other can magically summon an air elemental. Each of the five must use its action and movement on three consecutive turns to perform an aerial dance and must maintain concentration while doing so (as if concentrating on a spell). When all five have finished their third turn of the dance, the elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of them. It is friendly toward them and obeys their spoken commands. It remains for 1 hour, until it or all its summoners die, or until any of its summoners dismisses it as a bonus action. A summoner can't perform the dance again until it finishes a short rest. When the elemental returns to the Elemental Plane of Air, any aarakocra within 5 feet of it can return with it.": "五个在30英尺范围内的阿拉科克拉可以用魔法召唤一个空气元素。五个人中的每一个都必须在连续的三个回合中使用其动作和移动来进行空中舞蹈，并且在这样做的时候必须保持专注（就像专注于一个法术）。当所有五个人都完成了他们的第三轮舞蹈，这个元素出现在他们60英尺范围内的一个无人空间。它对他们很友好，并服从他们的口令。它将持续1小时，直到它或它的所有召唤者死亡，或直到它的任何一个召唤者以额外行动将其解散。在它完成短暂的休息之前，召唤者不能再次表演这个舞蹈。当元素回到空气元素界时，在它周围5英尺范围内的任何阿拉科克拉都可以和它一起返回。",
	"Before the coming of the gods, aboleths lurked in primordial oceans and underground lakes. They reached out with their minds and seized control of the burgeoning life-forms of the mortal realm, making those creatures their slaves. Their dominance made them like gods. Then the true gods appeared, smashing the aboleths' empire and freeing their slaves. Aboleths have never forgotten.": "在诸神到来之前，阿波勒斯潜伏在原始海洋和地下湖泊中。他们用自己的思想伸出手来，控制了凡人界新兴的生命形式，使这些生物成为他们的奴隶。他们的统治地位使他们像神一样。然后，真正的神出现了，粉碎了亚博莱思的帝国，并释放了他们的奴隶。Aboleths从未忘记。",
	"Aboleths have flawless memories. They pass on their knowledge and experience from generation to generation. Thus, the injury of their defeat by the gods remains perfectly preserved in their minds.": "Aboleths拥有完美无缺的记忆。他们将自己的知识和经验代代相传。因此，他们被众神打败的伤痛仍然完美地保存在他们的脑海中。",

Few creatures can conceive of the extent of an aboleth's plan.": "Aboleths的头脑是古代传说的宝库，能完美清晰地回忆起史前的时刻。他们耐心地、错综复杂地策划着跨世纪的计划。很少有生物能想象到阿波勒斯的计划范围。",
	" Aboleths dwell in watery environments, including ocean abysses, deep lakes, and the Elemental Plane of Water. In these domains and the lands that adjoin them, aboleths are like gods, demanding worship and obedience from their subjects. When they consume other creatures, aboleths add the knowledge and experiences of their prey to their eternal memories. Aboleths use their telepathic powers to read the minds of creatures and know their desires. An aboleth uses this knowledge to gain a creature's loyalty, promising to fulfill such wants in exchange for obedience. Within its lair, the aboleth can further use its powers to override senses, granting creatures, such as its followers, the illusion of promised rewards.": " Aboleths居住在水的环境中，包括海洋深渊、深湖和水元素界。在这些领域和与之相邻的土地上，阿波勒斯就像神一样，要求他们的臣民进行崇拜和顺从。当他们吞噬其他生物时，boleths将猎物的知识和经验加入他们永恒的记忆。Aboleths使用他们的心灵感应能力来阅读生物的思想，并了解他们的欲望。Aboleth利用这些知识来获得生物的忠诚，承诺满足这些欲望以换取服从。在它的巢穴中，阿波勒斯可以进一步使用它的力量来超越感官，给予生物，比如它的追随者，承诺的奖励的幻觉。",
	"The aboleths' fall from power is written in stark clarity on their flawless memories, for aboleths never truly die. If an aboleth's body is destroyed, its spirit returns to the Elemental Plane of Water, where a new body coalesces for it over days or months.": "Aboleth从权力中跌落的过程清晰地写在他们无暇的记忆中，因为Aboleth从未真正死亡。如果boleth的身体被摧毁，它的精神会回到水元素界，在那里，一个新的身体会在几天或几个月内为它凝聚起来。",
	"Ultimately, aboleths dream of overthrowing the gods and regaining control of the world. Aboleths have had untold eons to plot and to prepare their plans for perfect execution.": "最终，Aboleths梦想着推翻诸神，重新获得对世界的控制。Aboleths有数不清的时间来策划和准备他们的计划，以便完美执行。",
	"Aboleths lair in subterranean lakes or the rocky depths of the ocean, often surrounded by the ruins of an ancient, fallen aboleth city. An aboleth spends most of its existence underwater, surfacing occasionally to treat with visitors or deranged worshipers.": "Aboleth的巢穴在地下湖泊或海洋的岩石深处，通常被一个古老的、堕落的Aboleth城市的废墟所包围。Aboleth大部分时间都在水下生存，偶尔浮出水面，与访客或疯狂的崇拜者打交道。",
	"Acolytes are junior members of a clergy, usually answerable to a priest. They perform a variety of functions in a temple and are granted minor spellcasting power by their deities.": "圣徒是神职人员的初级成员，通常对牧师负责。他们在神庙中履行各种职能，并被他们的神灵授予小的法术能力。",
	"Even as long-lived as they are, all dragons must eventually die. This thought doesn't sit well with many dragons, some of which allow themselves to be transformed by necromantic energy and ancient rituals into powerful undead dracoliches. Only the most narcissistic dragons choose this path, knowing that by doing so, they sever all ties to their kin and the dragon gods.": "即使像他们一样长寿，所有的龙最终都必须死亡。这种想法对许多龙来说并不合适，其中一些龙允许自己被死灵能量和古老的仪式转化为强大的不死龙人。只有最自恋的龙才会选择这条道路，因为他们知道这样做会切断与他们的亲属和龙神的所有联系。",
	"A dracolich retains its shape and size upon transforming, its skin and scales drawing tight to its bones or sloughing away to leave a skeletal form behind. Its eyes appear as glowing points of light floating in shadowy sockets, hinting at the malevolence of its undead mind.": "德拉科维奇在变身后会保持其形状和大小，它的皮肤和鳞片会紧紧地贴在骨头上，或者剥落下来，留下一个骨架形状。它的眼睛就像漂浮在阴暗的眼眶中的发光点，暗示着它不死之心的恶毒。",
	"Though many dragons pursue vain goals of destruction and dominance, dracoliches are more nefarious than the most evil dragons, driven to rule over all. A dracolich is a fiendishly intelligent tyrant that crafts complex webs of foul schemes, attracting servants motivated by greed and a lust for power. Acting from the shadows and actively plotting to keep its existence a secret, a dracolich is a cunning and challenging foe.": "虽然许多龙都追求破坏和统治的虚荣目标，但龙族比最邪恶的龙更邪恶，他们被驱使着去统治所有的人。德拉科利奇是一个聪明绝顶的暴君，它制定了复杂的邪恶计划网，吸引了以贪婪和权力欲望为动机的仆人。德拉科里奇在阴影中行动，并积极策划保持其存在的秘密，是一个狡猾而富有挑战性的敌人。",
	"Creating a dracolich requires the cooperation of the dragon and a group of mages or cultists that can perform the proper ritual. During the ritual, the dragon consumes a toxic brew that slays it instantly. The attendant spellcasters then ensnare its spirit and transfer it to a special gemstone that functions like a lich's phylactery. As the dragon's flesh rots away, the spirit inside the gem returns to animate the dragon's bones.": "创造一个龙人需要龙和一群能够进行适当仪式的法师或邪教徒的合作。在仪式中，龙会喝下一种有毒的饮料，瞬间将其杀死。然后，随行的法术师将其灵魂捕获，并将其转移到一块特殊的宝石上，该宝石的功能类似于巫师的法器。当龙的肉体腐烂时，宝石中的灵魂就会回到龙的骨头上，使其充满活力。",
	"If a dracolich's physical form is ever destroyed, its spirit returns to the gem as long as the two are on the same plane. If the gem comes into contact with another dragon's corpse, the dracolich's spirit can take possession of that corpse to become a new dracolich. If the dracolich's spirit gem is taken to another plane, the dracolich's spirit has nowhere to go when its undead body is destroyed and simply passes into the afterlife.": "如果龙的身体形态被摧毁，只要两者在同一平面上，它的精神就会回到宝石中。如果宝石接触到另一个龙的尸体，龙的精神可以占有该尸体，成为一个新的龙。如果龙族的精神宝石被带到另一个位面，当龙族的不死之身被摧毁时，龙族的精神就无处可去，只能进入来世。",
	"Only an ancient or adult true dragon can be transformed into a dracolich. Younger dragons that attempt to undergo the transformation die, as do other creatures that aren't true dragons but possess the dragon type, such as pseudodragons and wyverns. A shadow dragon can't be transformed into a dracolich, for it has already lost too much of its physical form.": "只有古老或成年的真龙才能转化为龙人。试图变身的年轻龙会死亡，其他不是真龙但拥有龙型的生物也会死亡，比如假龙和狼人。影龙不能被转化为龙族，因为它已经失去了太多的身体形态。",
	"When a dragon becomes a dracolich, it retains its statistics except as described below. The dragon loses any trait, such as Amphibious, that assumes a living physiology. The dracolich might retain or lose any or all of its lair actions or inherit new ones, as the DM sees fit.": "当龙变成龙族时，除了以下描述外，它保留了它的统计数据。龙失去了任何特质，比如两栖的特质，这些特质具有活体的生理特征。龙可能会保留或失去它的任何或所有巢穴行动，或继承新的行动，这由DM决定。",
	" The dracolich's type changes from dragon to undead, and it no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep.": " 龙人的类型从龙变成了亡灵，它不再需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	" The dracolich has resistance to necrotic damage.": " 德拉科维奇对坏死的伤害有抵抗力。",
	" The dracolich has immunity to poison. It also retains any immunities it had prior to becoming a dracolich.": " 德拉科维奇对毒药有免疫力。它还保留了在成为龙卷风之前的任何免疫力。",
	" The dracolich has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.": " 德拉科里奇对法术和其他魔法效果的救赎有优势。",
	"An air elemental is a funneling cloud of whirling air with a vague semblance of a face. Although it likes to race across the ground, picking up dust and debris as it goes, it can also fly and attack from above.": "空气元素是一团旋转的漏斗状空气，隐约可见脸部的样子。虽然它喜欢在地面上奔跑，一边跑一边捡起灰尘和碎片，但它也能飞，从上面攻击。",
	"An air elemental can turn itself into a screaming cyclone, creating a whirlwind that batters creatures even as it flings them away.": "一个空气元素可以把自己变成一个尖叫的旋风，形成一股旋风，甚至在把生物甩开的同时还能击打它们。",
	"The allosaurus is a predator possessing great size, strength, and speed. It can run down almost any prey over open ground, pouncing to pull creatures down with its wicked claws.": "异特龙是一种拥有巨大体型、力量和速度的捕食者。它可以在空旷的地面上跑倒几乎所有的猎物，用它那邪恶的爪子扑上去把生物拉下来。",
	"Dinosaurs, or behemoths, are among the oldest reptiles in the world. Predatory dinosaurs are savage, territorial hunters. Herbivorous dinosaurs are less aggressive, but they might attack to defend their young, or if startled or harassed.": "恐龙，或称巨兽，是世界上最古老的爬行动物之一。掠食性恐龙是野蛮的、领土性的猎手。食草恐龙的攻击性较弱，但它们可能会为了保护自己的孩子，或在受到惊吓或骚扰时进行攻击。",
	"Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Larger varieties often have drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have colorful markings akin to birds. Dinosaurs roam rugged and isolated areas that humanoids seldom visit, including remote mountain valleys, inaccessible plateaus, tropical islands, and deep fens.": "恐龙有许多大小和形状。较大的品种通常有单调的颜色，而较小的恐龙则有类似鸟类的彩色斑纹。恐龙游荡在人类很少去的崎岖和孤立的地区，包括偏远的山沟、难以到达的高原、热带岛屿和深海沼泽。",
	"An androsphinx bears the head of a humanoid male on its lion's body. Outwardly gruff and downcast, it often begins conversations with insults or negative observations. Beneath this gruff exterior, however, an androsphinx has a noble heart. It has no wish to lie or deceive, but it doesn't give away information readily, choosing its words as wisely as it guards its secrets.": "狮头人的身体上长着一个人形男性的头。外表粗暴而低沉，它经常以侮辱或负面意见开始对话。然而，在这粗鲁的外表下，雄犀牛有一颗高贵的心。它不希望撒谎或欺骗，但它也不会轻易泄露信息，像保护自己的秘密一样明智地选择自己的语言。",
	"An androsphinx tests the courage and valor of supplicants, not only by forcing them to complete quests but also with its terrible roar, which echoes for miles as it terrifies and deafens nearby creatures. Those who pass its tests may be rewarded with a heroes' feast.": "雄鼻兽考验祈求者的勇气和胆量，不仅强迫他们完成任务，而且还发出可怕的吼声，使附近的生物感到恐惧和震耳欲聋，回响数英里。那些通过测试的人可能会得到一个英雄盛宴的奖励。",
	"In sacred isolation, a sphinx guards the secrets and treasures of the gods. As it calmly regards each new party that comes before it, the bones of supplicants and quest seekers that failed to pass its tests lie scattered around its lair. Its great wings sweep along its flanks, its tawny leonine body rippling with muscle and possessed of forepaws powerful enough to tear a humanoid in half.": "在神圣的隔离环境中，狮身人面像守护着众神的秘密和宝藏。当它平静地看待每一个来到它面前的新队伍时，那些未能通过它考验的祈求者和任务寻求者的骨头散落在它的巢穴周围。它巨大的翅膀沿着侧翼掠过，灰褐色的柠檬色的身体上荡漾着肌肉，拥有的前爪足以将一个人形物体撕成两半。",
	"Sphinxes test the worth of those who seek the treasures of the gods, whether forgotten secrets or mighty spells, artifacts or magical gateways. Creatures that choose to face a sphinx's test are bound to that test unto death, and only those worthy will survive it. The rest the sphinx destroys.": "狮身人面像考验那些寻求诸神宝藏的人的价值，无论是被遗忘的秘密还是强大的法术、神器或魔法之门。选择面对斯芬克斯考验的生物被束缚在这个考验中，直到死亡，只有那些有价值的人才能活下来。其余的则被斯芬克斯摧毁。",
	"Some sphinxes are high priests of the gods that create them, but most are simply embodied spirits, brought into the mortal realm by devout prayer or direct intervention. A sphinx maintains its vigil tirelessly, not needing to sleep or eat. It rarely engages with others of its kind, knowing no other life except its sacred mission.": "有些狮身人面像是创造它们的神的高级祭司，但大多数只是化身的灵魂，通过虔诚的祈祷或直接干预被带到了凡间。狮身人面像不知疲倦地守候着，不需要睡觉或吃饭。它很少与其他同类打交道，除了神圣的使命，它不知道其他的生活。",
	" The secrets and treasures a sphinx guards remain under divine protection, so that when a creature fails a sphinx's test, the path to the object or knowledge it guards vanishes. Even if a sphinx is attacked and defeated, a quester will still fail to gain the secret it sought-and will make an enemy of the god that placed the sphinx as a guardian.": " 狮身人面像所守护的秘密和宝藏仍然受到神的保护，所以当一个生物未能通过狮身人面像的测试时，通往它所守护的物品或知识的道路就会消失。即使狮身人面像被攻击并被击败，探索者仍然无法获得它所寻找的秘密--并且会与放置狮身人面像作为守护者的神明为敌。",
	"Benign deities sometimes grant a sphinx the power to remove supplicants that fail their tests, transporting them away and ensuring that they never encounter the sphinx again. However, those who fail a sphinx's test typically meet a gruesome end beneath its claws.": "善良的神灵有时会授予狮身人面像权力，将未能通过测试的祈求者带走，将他们送走，确保他们再也不会遇到狮身人面像。然而，那些未能通过斯芬克斯测试的人通常会在它的爪子下遭遇可怕的结局。",
	" Mortals that encounter sphinxes do so most often in ancient tombs and ruins, but some sphinxes can access extraplanar realms. A conversation with a sphinx that begins between tumbled stone walls might suddenly shift to an alien locale, such as a life-sized game board or a daunting cliff that must be climbed in a howling storm. Sometimes a sphinx must be summoned from such an extradimensional space, with supplicants calling it from its empty lair. Only those the sphinx deems worthy gain admittance to its realm.": " 凡人遇到狮身人面像最常见的是在古墓和废墟中，但有些狮身人面像可以进入星外的领域。与狮身人面像的对话开始于翻滚的石墙之间，可能会突然转移到一个陌生的地方，比如一个真人大小的游戏盘或一个必须在呼啸的风暴中攀登的令人生畏的悬崖。有时，狮身人面像必须从这样一个超维空间被召唤出来，祈求者从它的空巢中召唤它。只有那些斯芬克斯认为有价值的人才能进入它的领域。",
	" Whether through the weariness of the ages, regret at the slaughter of innocents, or dreams of worship by supplicants that attempt to bargain their way to knowledge, some sphinxes break free of their divine command. However, even if a sphinx's alignment and loyalties drift in this way, it never leaves the place it guards or grants its secrets to any except creatures it deems worthy.": " 无论是通过岁月的疲惫、对屠杀无辜者的悔恨，还是试图通过讨价还价获得知识的祈求者的崇拜之梦，一些斯芬克斯挣脱了他们的神圣命令。然而，即使狮身人面像的结盟和忠诚度以这种方式漂移，它也不会离开它所守护的地方，或将它的秘密授予任何它认为值得的生物。",

	"Animated objects are crafted with potent magic to follow the commands of their creators. When not commanded, they follow the last order they received to the best of their ability, and can act independently to fulfill simple instructions.

	"An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.": "一个有动画的物体不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。当一个物体的命中率下降到0时，使该物体有生命的魔法就会被驱散。一个被激活的物体降到了0点，就变成了无生命的，并且被破坏得太厉害，对任何人都没有什么用处或价值。",

	"To add to its menace, animated armor is frequently enchanted with scripted speech, so the armor can utter warnings, demand passwords, or deliver riddles. Rare suits of animated armor are able to carry on an actual conversation.": "为了增加其威胁性，动画盔甲经常被赋予脚本语言，因此盔甲可以发出警告，要求输入密码，或提供谜语。罕见的动画盔甲能够进行真正的对话。",
	"An ankheg resembles an enormous many-legged insect, its long antennae twitching in response to any movement around it. Its legs end in sharp hooks adapted for burrowing and grasping its prey, and its powerful mandibles can snap a small tree in half.": "蚁人类似于一只巨大的多腿昆虫，其长长的触角会对周围的任何运动作出反应而抽动。它的腿末端有锋利的钩子，适合于钻入和抓取猎物，其强大的下颚可以将一棵小树折成两半。",
	"The ankheg uses its powerful mandibles to dig winding tunnels deep beneath the ground. When it hunts, an ankheg burrows upward, waiting below the surface until its antennae detect movement from above. Then it bursts from the earth and seizes prey in its mandibles, crushing and grinding while it secretes acidic digestive enzymes. These enzymes help dissolve a victim for easy swallowing, but the ankheg can also squirt acid to take down foes.": "安克希格利用其强大的下颚在地下深处挖掘蜿蜒的隧道。当它捕猎时，安克希格会向上钻，在地表下等待，直到它的触角探测到来自上方的运动。然后，它从地底冲出，用下颚抓住猎物，一边碾压，一边分泌酸性消化酶。这些酶有助于溶解受害者，以便于吞咽，但安克希格也可以喷出酸液来击倒敌人。",
	"Although ankhegs receive a certain portion of their nutrients from the soil through which they burrow, they must supplement their diet with fresh meat. Pastures teeming with grazing livestock and forests rife with game are an ankheg's prime hunting grounds. Ankhegs are thus the bane of farmers and rangers everywhere.": "虽然安克希格从它们所钻的土壤中获得一定的营养，但它们必须用新鲜的肉来补充它们的饮食。充斥着放牧牲畜的牧场和充满野味的森林是安克希格的主要猎场。因此，Ankhegs是各地农民和护林员的祸根。",
	"As it burrows through earth, the ankheg leaves a narrow, partially collapsed tunnel in its wake. In these tunnels, one might find the remnants of molted ankheg chitin, hatched ankheg eggs, or the grisly remains of ankheg victims, including coins or other treasures scattered during the creature's attack.": "当它钻进土里时，安克希格会留下一条狭窄的、部分坍塌的隧道。在这些隧道中，人们可能会发现蜕皮的安克希格甲壳素的残余物，孵化的安克希格蛋，或安克希格受害者的可怕遗骸，包括硬币或其他在生物攻击期间散落的宝物。",
	"Thick armor plating covers the body of the plant-eating ankylosaurus, which defends itself against predators with a knobbed tail that delivers a devastating strike. Some varieties of ankylosaurus have spiked tails that deal piercing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.": "厚厚的装甲覆盖了食植物的强龙的身体，它用有节的尾巴来抵御掠食者的攻击，并发出毁灭性的打击。有些种类的强龙的尾巴上有尖刺，可以造成穿刺伤害而不是重击伤害。",
	"Arcanaloths are sly, jackal-headed beings with humanoid bodies, but they can employ magic to take any humanoid form. They do so to gain the trust of creatures with whom they negotiate, replacing jackal snarls with winsome smiles.

Highly intelligent spellcasters who hunger for knowledge and power, arcanaloths command units of lesser yugoloths and maintain the contracts, records, and accounts of their kind.": "阿卡纳罗斯是狡猾的、长着豺狼头的生命，有着人形的身体，但他们可以运用魔法变成任何人形。他们这样做是为了获得与他们谈判的生物的信任，用迷人的微笑取代豺狼的咆哮。无论选择哪种形态，阿卡纳罗斯都显得很有修养，身穿精美的长袍。渴望知识和权力的高智商施法者，阿卡纳罗斯指挥着较小的尤格罗特部队，维护着他们的合同、记录和账户。",
	"Arcanaloths speak and write all languages, making them cunning diplomats and negotiators. An arcanaloth properly paid can broker treaties or alliances with subtlety and finesse, just as an arcanaloth who changes sides can easily turn the best-laid peace talks into all-out war.

	"Archmages are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom.

	"Natives of the Elemental Plane of Fire, azers are master crafters, expert miners, and sworn foes of the efreet. In appearance and manner, an azer resembles a male dwarf, but this is a facade.

	" Azers don't reproduce. They are each crafted from bronze by another azer and imbued with a portion of the crafter's inner flame. Each azer is sculpted with unique features.

	"Long ago, the efreet and the azers were allies. Azers helped create the City of Brass, forging that home of the efreet into one of the most wondrous places in creation. When the azers had finished their work, the efreet betrayed them, making a failed attempt to enslave the azers so as to protect the secrets of the city. Despite occasional raids and skirmishes, however, the two sides have so far refrained from all-out conflict. The azers believe that only the threat of them revealing the hidden ways into the City of Brass keeps the efreet in check.": "很久以前，伊弗里特人和阿泽尔人是盟友。阿泽尔人帮助创建了黄铜城，将伊夫里特人的家园锻造成了造物中最奇妙的地方之一。当阿兹尔人完成他们的工作后，伊夫里特人背叛了他们，试图奴役阿兹尔人以保护城市的秘密，但没有成功。尽管偶尔会有突袭和小规模的冲突，但双方至今都没有发生全面的冲突。阿兹尔人认为，只有他们透露进入黄铜之城的隐秘途径的威胁才能使伊夫里特人受到控制。",
	"Azers are masterful artisans, and create beautiful works from the gems and precious metals found in their volcanic habitat. They rate the value of such treasures above all other things, sometimes dispatching parties across the planes to seek out rare metals and gemstones.": "阿泽尔人是高超的工匠，他们用在火山栖息地发现的宝石和贵重金属创造出美丽的作品。他们把这种宝物的价值看得高于一切，有时会派人到各星球去寻找稀有金属和宝石。",
	"When azers are called by magic to the Material Plane, it is typically to help forge an elaborate magic item or work of art, for it is said that their skill in such craft knows no equal.": "当阿兹尔被魔法召唤到物质世界时，通常是为了帮助锻造一个精致的魔法物品或艺术品，因为据说他们在这种工艺方面的技能是无人能及的。",
	"An azer doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.": "Azer不需要食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Figures of ancient and terrible evil, balors rule as generals over demonic armies, yearning to seize power while destroying any creatures that oppose them.": "Balors是古老而可怕的邪恶人物，他们作为将军统治着恶魔的军队，渴望夺取权力，同时摧毁任何反对他们的生物。",
	"Wielding a flaming whip and a longsword that channels the power of the storm, a balor's battle prowess is fueled by hatred and rage. It channels this demonic fury in its death throes, falling within a blast of fire that can destroy even the hardiest foes.": "挥舞着火焰鞭子和一把长剑，引导着风暴的力量，巴洛尔的战斗力是由仇恨和愤怒推动的。它在死亡的时候会引导这种恶魔般的愤怒，在火焰的爆炸中倒下，甚至可以摧毁最顽强的敌人。",
	"Bandits rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.": "土匪以帮派形式游荡，有时由暴徒、老兵或施法者领导。并非所有土匪都是邪恶的。压迫、干旱、疾病或饥荒往往会驱使其他诚实的人过上强盗的生活。",
	"Pirates are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation's vessels.": "海盗是公海上的匪徒。他们可能是只对财宝和谋杀感兴趣的自由盗贼，也可能是由王室批准的袭击和掠夺敌人国家船只的私掠者。",
	"It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of bandits in line. The bandit captain has these qualities in spades.": "要让一帮强盗保持一致，需要强大的个性、无情的狡猾和银色的舌头。土匪头子就具备这些素质。",
	"In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the pirate captain is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.": "除了管理一帮自私自利的恶棍之外，海盗船长也是强盗船长的变种，要保护和指挥一艘船。为了让船员们保持一致，船长必须定期进行奖惩。",
	"More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain's colorful reputation.": "比起财宝，强盗船长或海盗船长更渴望声名狼藉。一个迎合船长的虚荣心或自尊心的囚犯比一个不知道或声称不知道船长的多彩名声的囚犯更有可能得到公平对待。",
	"When night falls, unlucky travelers hear the faint cries of the forlorn dead. This woeful spirit is a banshee, a spiteful creature formed from the spirit of a female elf. Banshees appear as luminous, wispy forms that vaguely recall their mortal features. A banshee's face is wreathed in a wild tangle of hair, its body clad in wispy rags that flutter and stream around it.": "当夜幕降临时，倒霉的旅行者会听到绝望的死者的微弱哭声。这种悲惨的灵魂是女妖，一种由女性精灵的灵魂形成的可憎的生物。女妖以发光的、飘忽不定的形式出现，依稀可以看出其凡人的特征。女妖的脸被疯狂的头发缠绕着，它的身体披着飘忽不定的破布，在它周围飘动和流动。",
	"Banshees are the undead remnants of elves who, blessed with great beauty, failed to use their gift to bring joy to the world. Instead, they used their beauty to corrupt and control others. Elves afflicted by the banshee's curse experience no gladness, feeling only distress in the presence of the living. As the curse takes its toll, their minds and bodies decay, until death completes their transformation into undead monsters.": "女妖是精灵的不死残余，她们被赋予了巨大的美貌，却没有利用她们的天赋为世界带来欢乐。相反，他们利用自己的美貌来腐蚀和控制他人。遭受女妖诅咒的精灵们不会体验到快乐，在活人面前只感到痛苦。随着诅咒造成的损失，他们的思想和身体都会腐烂，直到死亡使他们完成了向不死怪物的转变。",
	"A banshee becomes forever bound to the place of its demise, unable to venture more than five miles from there. It is forced to relive every moment of its life with perfect recall, yet always refuses to accept responsibility for its doom.": "女妖将永远被束缚在其死亡的地方，无法冒险离开那里超过五英里。它被迫以完美的回忆重温其生命中的每一刻，但始终拒绝为自己的死亡负责。",
	"The vanity that inspired the banshee's cursed creation persists in undeath. These creatures covet beautiful objects: fine jewelery, paintings, statues, and other objects of art. At the same time, a banshee abhors any mirrored surface, for it can't bear to see the horror of its own existence. A single glimpse of itself is enough to send a banshee into a rage.": "激发女妖受诅咒的创作的虚荣心在未死时依然存在。这些生物觊觎美丽的物品：精美的珠宝、绘画、雕像和其他艺术物品。同时，女妖厌恶任何镜面，因为它不能忍受看到自己存在的恐怖。只要看到自己的一瞥，就足以让女妖陷入愤怒。",
	"A banshee doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "女妖不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Creatures of unbridled greed and desire, barbed devils act as guards to the more powerful denizens of the Nine Hells and their vaults. Resembling a tall humanoid covered in sharp barbs, spines, and hooks, a barbed devil has gleaming eyes that are ever watchful for objects and creatures it might claim for itself. These fiends welcome any chance to fight when victory promises reward.": "带刺魔鬼是一种贪婪和欲望无度的生物，它是九层地狱中更强大的居民及其金库的守卫。带刺魔鬼像一个高大的人形生物，身上长满了锋利的倒钩、刺和钩子，它有一双闪闪发光的眼睛，时刻注意着它可能为自己索取的物品和生物。当胜利带来回报时，这些恶魔欢迎任何战斗的机会。",
	"Barbed devils are known for an alertness that makes them difficult to surprise, and they attend to their duties without boredom or distraction. They use their sharp claws as weapons or hurl balls of flame at foes that try to flee them.": "带刺魔鬼以警觉性高而著称，这使得他们难以出其不意，他们不厌其烦地履行自己的职责，也不分心。它们用锋利的爪子作为武器，或者向试图逃离它们的敌人投掷火焰球。",
	"The barlgura represents the savagery and brutality of the Abyss. Barlguras gather in packs to take down tougher foes, keep gruesome trophies from their victories, and decorate their territory with such objects.": "巴尔古拉代表着深渊的野蛮和残暴。巴尔古拉成群结队，打倒更强悍的敌人，保留他们胜利后的可怕战利品，并用这些物品装饰他们的领土。",
	"A barlgura looks like a hulking orangutan with a gruesome, drooping visage and tusks jutting from its jaw. Standing just under 8 feet tall, it has broad shoulders and weighs 650 pounds. It moves apishly along the ground, but it climbs with great speed and agility.": "巴尔古拉看起来像一只笨重的猩猩，有一个可怕的、下垂的面孔，下颚有獠牙突出。它身高不到8英尺，肩部宽阔，体重达650磅。它沿着地面猿猴般地移动，但它以极快的速度和敏捷性爬行。",
	"Travelers sometimes find objects that look like pieces of remarkably lifelike stone carvings of wildlife. Missing parts appear to have been bitten off. Seasoned explorers regard such relics as warnings, knowing that the basilisk that created them is likely to be nearby.": "旅行者有时会发现一些物体，它们看起来就像栩栩如生的野生动物石雕的碎片。缺少的部分似乎是被咬掉的。经验丰富的探险家将这些遗物视为警告，因为他们知道创造它们的玄武岩可能就在附近。",
	"Basilisks thrive in arid, temperate, or tropical climates. They lair in caves or other sheltered sites. Most often, basilisks are encountered underground.": "Basilisks在干旱、温带或热带气候下生长。它们在山洞或其他有遮挡的地方筑巢。最常见的情况是，巴西利亚人在地下遇到。",
	"A basilisk born and raised in captivity can be domesticated and trained. Such a trained basilisk knows how to avoid meeting the eyes of those its master wishes to protect from its gaze, but it makes a daunting guardian beast. Because of this use, basilisk eggs are highly prized.": "在人工饲养下出生和长大的巴斯里斯克可以被驯化和训练。这样的训练有素的巴斯里斯克知道如何避免与它的主人希望保护的人对视，但它是一个令人生畏的守护神兽。由于这种用途，巴斯里斯克的蛋被高度珍视。",
	"Basilisks are ponderous for hunting creatures, but they needn't chase prey. Meeting a basilisk's supernatural gaze can be enough to affect a rapid transformation, transforming a victim into porous stone. Basilisks, with their strong jaws, are able to consume the stone. The stone returns to organic form in the basilisk's gullet.": "玄武岩对于狩猎生物来说是深思熟虑的，但它们不需要追赶猎物。遇到巴斯里斯克超自然的目光，就足以影响它的快速转变，将受害者变成多孔的石头。玄武岩，以其强壮的下颚，能够吞噬石头。石头在巴斯里斯克的口中恢复到有机形态。",
	"Bearded devils serve archdevils as shock troops, fighting shoulder-to-shoulder and reveling in the glory of battle. They respond with violence to any slight, real or imagined, gorging themselves on violence as their infernal saw-toothed glaives carve a path through their foes.": "有胡子的魔鬼为大魔鬼服务，作为突击队，肩并肩地战斗，陶醉于战斗的荣耀。他们用暴力来回应任何轻视，不管是真实的还是想象的，当他们的地狱锯齿状玻璃刀在他们的敌人身上开出一条路时，他们就会大吃大喝起来。",
	"A bearded devil is humanoid in form, with pointed ears, scaly skin, a long tail, and claws that clearly show its fiendish nature. These devils take their names from the snakelike growths that adorn their chins, which they use to lash and poison enemies, weakening them with their virulent venom.": "胡子魔鬼是人形的，有尖尖的耳朵，有鳞片的皮肤，有长长的尾巴，还有清楚地显示其恶魔本性的爪子。这些魔鬼的名字来自于他们下巴上长出的像蛇一样的东西，他们用这些东西来鞭打和毒害敌人，用毒液削弱他们的力量。",
	"The serpentine behir crawls along floors and clambers up walls to reach its prey. Its lightning breath can incinerate most creatures, even as more powerful foes are constricted in its coils and eaten alive.": "蛇形的贝希尔沿着地板爬行，并爬上墙壁以接近它的猎物。它的闪电气息可以焚烧大多数生物，即使是更强大的敌人也会被它的线圈束缚住并被活活吃掉。",
	"A behir's monstrous form resembles a combination of centipede and crocodile. Its scaled hide ranges from ultramarine to deep blue in color, fading to pale blue on its underside.": "贝希尔的畸形形态类似于蜈蚣和鳄鱼的组合。它的鳞片皮的颜色从群青色到深蓝色不等，在它的底部渐渐变成淡蓝色。",
	"Behirs lair in places inaccessible to other creatures, favoring locations where would-be intruders must make a harrowing climb to reach them. Deep pits, high caves in cliff walls, and caverns reached only by narrow, twisting tunnels are prime sites for a behir ambush. A behir's dozen legs allow it to scramble through its lair site with ease. When not climbing, it moves even faster by folding its legs beside its body and slithering like a snake.": "贝希尔在其他生物无法进入的地方筑巢，喜欢那些可能的入侵者必须经过艰苦的攀爬才能到达的地方。深坑、崖壁上的高洞以及只能通过狭窄、曲折的隧道到达的洞穴，都是贝希尔伏击的主要地点。一个behir的十几条腿使它能够轻松地爬过它的巢穴地点。不爬的时候，它通过把腿折叠在身体旁边，像蛇一样滑行，移动得更快。",
	"Behirs swallow their prey whole, after which they enter a period of dormancy while they digest. While dormant, a behir chooses a hiding place where intruders in its lair might overlook it.": "猎物被整个吞下，之后在消化过程中进入休眠期。在休眠期间，贝希尔会选择一个隐藏的地方，在那里它的巢穴的入侵者可能会忽略它。",
	"In times long forgotten, giants and dragons engaged in seemingly endless war. Storm giants created the first behirs as weapons against the dragons, and behirs retain a natural hatred for dragonkind.": "在被遗忘已久的时代，巨人和巨龙进行着似乎无休止的战争。风暴巨人创造了第一批贝希尔，作为对抗龙的武器，而贝希尔对龙族保持着天然的仇恨。",
	"A behir never makes its lair in an area it knows to be inhabited by a dragon. If a dragon attempts to establish a lair within a few dozen miles of a behir's lair, the behir is compelled to kill the dragon or drive it off. Only if the dragon proves too powerful to fight does a behir back down, seeking out a new lair site a great distance away.": "贝里尔从不在它知道有龙居住的地方筑巢。如果有龙试图在贝里尔巢穴的几十英里范围内建立巢穴，贝里尔会被迫杀死龙或将其赶走。只有当龙被证明过于强大而无法战斗时，贝希尔才会退缩，在很远的地方寻找一个新的巢穴地点。",
	"One glance at a beholder is enough to assess its foul and otherworldly nature. Aggressive, hateful, and greedy, these aberrations dismiss all other creatures as lesser beings, toying with them or destroying them as they choose.": "只要看一眼，就足以评估其肮脏和异世界的性质。侵略性、憎恨和贪婪，这些反常者将所有其他生物视为低等生物，随意玩弄或摧毁它们。",
	"A beholder's spheroid body levitates at all times, and its great bulging eye sits above a wide, toothy maw, while the smaller eyestalks that crown its body twist and turn to keep its foes in sight. When a beholder sleeps, it closes its central eye but leaves its smaller eyes open and alert.": "看守者的球状身体随时都会悬浮起来，它巨大的隆起的眼睛坐落在宽大的、有齿的大嘴之上，而它身体上的小眼柄则扭曲和转动，以保持它的敌人在视线内。当看守者睡觉时，它会闭上它的中心眼，但让它的小眼睛睁开并保持警惕。",
	"Enemies abound, or so every beholder believes. Beholders are convinced that other creatures resent them for their brilliance and magical power, even as they dismiss those lesser creatures as crude and disgusting. Beholders always suspect others of plotting against them, even when no other creatures are around.": "敌人比比皆是，或者说每个看客都这么认为。看守者确信其他生物因为他们的光辉和魔力而憎恨他们，即使他们把那些较小的生物视为粗鲁和恶心。看待者总是怀疑其他人在密谋对付他们，即使周围没有其他生物。",
	"The disdain a beholder has for other creatures extends to other beholders. Each beholder believes its form to be an ideal, and that any deviation from that form is a flaw in the racial purity of its kind. Beholders vary greatly in their physical forms, making conflict between them inevitable. Some beholders are protected by overlapping chitinous plates. Some have smooth hides. Some have eyestalks that writhe like tentacles, while others' stalks bear crustacean-like joints. Even slight differences of coloration in hide can turn two beholders into lifelong enemies.": "一个看守者对其他生物的蔑视也延伸到其他看守者。每个人都认为自己的形态是一种理想，任何偏离这种形态的行为都是对其种族纯洁性的一种缺陷。看守者的身体形态差异很大，因此他们之间的冲突不可避免。有些变形金刚被重叠的几丁质板所保护。有些则有光滑的皮毛。有些人的眼柄像触角一样蠕动，而另一些人的眼柄则有甲壳类动物的关节。即使是皮肤颜色上的细微差别，也能使两个人变成终生的敌人。",
	"Some beholders manage to channel their xenophobic tendencies into a terrible despotism. Rather than live in isolation, the aptly named eye tyrants enslave those other creatures, founding and controlling vast empires. An eye tyrant sometimes carves out a domain within or under a major city, commanding networks of agents that operate on their master's behalf.": "一些眼球持有者设法将他们的排外倾向转化为可怕的专制主义。这些被恰当地命名为眼球暴君的人并没有与世隔绝，而是奴役那些其他生物，建立并控制庞大的帝国。一个眼球暴君有时会在一个主要城市内或地下开辟出一个领域，指挥着代表其主人的代理人网络。",
	"Because they refuse to share territory with others, most beholders withdraw to frigid hills, abandoned ruins, and deep caverns to scheme. A beholder's lair is carved out by its disintegration eye ray, emphasizing vertical passages connecting chambers stacked on top of each other. Such an environment allows a beholder to move freely, even as it prevents intruders from easily creeping about. When intruders do break in, the height of its open ceilings allows a beholder to float up and harry foes on the floor.": "因为他们拒绝与他人分享领地，所以大多数beholder都撤回到寒冷的山丘、废弃的废墟和深邃的洞穴中进行谋划。一个Beholder的巢穴是由它的分解眼射线雕刻出来的，强调垂直通道，连接堆叠在一起的房间。这样的环境允许看守者自由移动，即使它阻止了入侵者轻易地爬行。当入侵者真的闯入时，其开放的天花板的高度允许看守者漂浮起来，在地板上骚扰敌人。",
	"As alien as their creator, the rooms in a beholder's lair reflect the creature's arrogance. It festoons its chambers with trophies from the battles it has won, including {@condition petrified} adventurers standing frozen in their horrified final moments, pieces of other beholders, and magic items wrested from powerful foes. A beholder judges its own worth by its acquisitions, and it never willingly parts with its treasures.": "就像它们的创造者一样，持灵者的巢穴中的房间反映了这种生物的傲慢。它用它赢得的战利品来装饰它的房间，包括{@condition petrified}站在他们惊恐的最后时刻的冒险者，其他持灵者的碎片，以及从强大的敌人手中夺取的魔法物品。一个持有者以其获得的东西来判断自己的价值，它从不愿意与它的宝物分开。",
	"A beholder's central lair is typically a large, spacious cavern with high ceilings, where it can attack without fear of closing to melee range. A beholder encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 14 (11,500 XP).": "看守者的中心巢穴通常是一个宽敞的大洞穴，天花板很高，在那里它可以毫无顾忌地进行攻击，而不用担心接近近战范围。在巢穴中遇到的Beholder的挑战等级为14（11,500XP）。",
	"Hailing from uncivilized lands, unpredictable berserkers come together in war parties and seek conflict wherever they can find it.": "来自未开化的土地，不可预知的狂暴者聚集在一起组成战队，在他们能找到的地方寻求冲突。",
	"The most evil-tempered and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.": "黑龙是色龙中脾气最坏、最卑鄙的，它收集堕落民族的残骸和财物。这些龙厌恶看到弱者的繁荣，并为人形王国的崩溃而感到高兴。它们把自己的家安在潮湿的沼泽地和王国曾经存在的摇摇欲坠的废墟上。",
	"With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon's face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.": "黑龙有深陷的眼睛和宽大的鼻孔，它的脸就像一个头骨。它弯曲的、分段式的角在靠近底部时是骨色的，在角的顶端会变暗，变成死黑色。随着黑龙的衰老，它的角和颧骨周围的肉会像被酸吃掉一样变质，留下薄薄的皮层，增强其骨骼的外观。黑龙的头部有尖刺和角的标志。它的舌头是平的，顶端分叉，流着粘液，其酸性气味使龙的腐烂植物和臭水的气味更加浓郁。",
	"When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.": "当黑龙孵化时，它有光亮的黑色鳞片。随着年龄的增长，它的鳞片变得更厚、更暗淡，帮助它融入沼泽地和被炸毁的废墟中，这是它的家。",
	"All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.": "所有的色龙都是邪恶的，但黑龙因其虐待狂的本性而与众不同。黑龙的生活就是看着它的猎物乞求怜悯，并经常在结束它的敌人之前提供一个喘息或逃跑的假象。",
	"A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.": "黑龙首先攻击它最弱小的敌人，确保快速和残酷的胜利，这使它的自尊心得到加强，因为它使剩下的敌人感到害怕。在失败的边缘，黑龙会尽其所能拯救自己，但在允许任何其他生物对其进行控制之前，它接受了死亡。",
	"Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.": "黑龙讨厌并害怕其他龙。它们从远处窥探龙族的对手，寻找机会杀死较弱的龙，避开较强的龙。如果有更强的龙威胁到它，黑龙就会放弃它的巢穴，寻找新的领地。",
	"Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons, raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food to give as tribute and building crude draconic effigies along the borders of their dragon master's domain.": "邪恶的蜥蜴人崇敬并服务于黑龙，他们掠夺人形定居点的财宝和食物作为贡品，并沿着龙族主人的领地边界建造粗陋的龙族雕像。",
	"A black dragon's malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon's lair.": "黑龙的恶意影响还可能导致自发地创造出邪恶的晃动土丘，寻找并杀死接近龙巢的善良生物。",
	"Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipede bites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon's hunger.": "哥布林像害虫一样在许多黑龙的巢穴中出没。他们变得和他们的黑暗主人一样残忍，经常用蜈蚣咬和蝎子刺来折磨和削弱俘虏，然后再把他们送去满足龙的饥渴。",
	"Black dragons hoard the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current civilizations for itself.": "黑龙囤积着崩溃的帝国和被征服的王国的财宝和魔法物品，以提醒自己的伟大。龙的文明越多，它就越觉得有资格为自己索取当前文明的财富。",
	"Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon's lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.": "黑龙居住在文明边缘的沼泽地。黑龙的巢穴是一个阴暗的洞穴、石窟或废墟，至少部分被水淹没，提供龙休息的水池，以及它的受害者可以发酵的地方。巢穴里到处都是以前受害者的酸蚀骨头和新杀的苍蝇尸体，由摇摇欲坠的雕像看管。蜈蚣、蝎子和蛇在巢穴里出没，巢穴里充满了死亡和腐烂的臭味。",
	"A black pudding resembles a heaving mound of sticky black sludge. In dim passageways, the pudding appears to be little more than a blot of shadow.": "黑布丁就像一坨堆积如山的粘稠黑泥。在昏暗的通道中，布丁似乎只是一个斑驳的阴影。",
	"Flesh, wood, metal, and bone dissolve when the pudding ebbs over them. Stone remains behind, wiped clean.": "肉体、木头、金属和骨头在布丁流经它们时都会溶解。石头留在后面，被擦拭干净。",
	"Oozes thrive in the dark, shunning areas of bright light and extreme temperatures. They flow through the damp underground, feeding on any creature or object that can be dissolved, slinking along the ground, dripping from walls and ceilings, spreading across the edges of underground pools, and squeezing through cracks.": "渗水虫在黑暗中茁壮成长，避开强光和极端温度的区域。它们在潮湿的地下流动，以任何可以溶解的生物或物体为食，沿着地面滑行，从墙壁和天花板上滴下，在地下水池的边缘蔓延，并从裂缝中挤入。",
	"The first warning an adventurer receives of an ooze's presence is often the searing pain of its acidic touch. Oozes are drawn to movement and warmth. Organic material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce they feed on grime, fungus, and offal. Veteran explorers know that an immaculately clean passageway is a likely sign that an ooze lairs nearby.": "冒险者收到的第一个警告，往往是它的酸性触摸带来的灼热疼痛。渗水者被运动和温暖所吸引。有机物能滋养它们，当猎物匮乏时，它们以污垢、真菌和内脏为食。资深的探险家们知道，一个干净的通道很可能是一种迹象，表明附近有渗出物栖息。",
	" An ooze kills its prey slowly. Some varieties, such as black puddings and gelatinous cubes, engulf creatures to prevent escape. The only upside of this torturous death is that a victim's comrades can come to the rescue before it is too late.": " 渗出物会慢慢杀死它的猎物。有些品种，如黑色布丁和胶状方块，会吞噬生物以防止逃跑。这种折磨人的死亡的唯一好处是，受害者的战友可以在太晚之前赶来救援。",
	"Since not every ooze digests every type of substance, some have coins, metal gear, bones, and other debris suspended within their quivering bodies. A slain ooze can be a rich source of treasure for its killers.": "由于并不是每只敖包都能消化每一种物质，有些敖包的颤抖的身体里悬浮着硬币、金属装备、骨头和其他碎片。一个被杀的渗水者可以为其杀手提供丰富的财宝。",
	"Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of sentience and malevolent intent.": "无论这是否属实，无面者之王是少数能控制ozes并给它们注入适度智慧的生命之一。大多数时候，ozes没有战术或自我保护的意识。它们是直接的、可预测的，攻击和吃东西都不狡猾。在Juiblex的控制下，它们表现出一丝有意识和邪恶的意图。",
	" Although an ooze lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that understand an ooze's need to feed might lure it into a location where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.": " 虽然渗水虫缺乏与其他生物结盟的智慧，但其他了解渗水虫需要进食的生物可能会把它引诱到一个对它们有用的地方。聪明的怪物会在周围养一些渗水体来保卫通道或消耗垃圾。同样地，也可以引诱渗水者进入坑道陷阱，让捕捉者经常喂食它，以防止它来追杀他们。狡猾的生物在战略区域放置火把和燃烧的火炉，以劝阻渗水者离开某个特定的通道或房间。",
	" According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex.": " 根据Iggwilv的Demonomicon和其他资料，ozes是散落的碎片或恶魔领主Juiblex的后代。",
	" An ooze doesn't require sleep.": " 渗出物不需要睡眠。",

	"A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.": "蓝龙可以通过它那引人注目的带褶皱的耳朵和钝头顶上巨大的脊状角来识别。一排排的尖刺从它的鼻孔向后延伸到它的眉毛上，并聚集在它突出的下颌上。",
	"A blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.": "蓝龙的鳞片颜色各异，从五彩斑斓的天蓝色到深邃的靛蓝色，被沙漠中的沙子打磨成光亮的表面。随着龙的年龄增长，它的鳞片会变得更厚更硬，它的皮会发出嗡嗡声和静电的噼啪声。当龙生气或要攻击时，这些效果就会加强，散发出臭氧和灰尘的气味。",
	"A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.": "蓝龙不会容忍任何关于它软弱或低劣的评论或影射，它非常乐于将自己的力量凌驾于人类和其他较小的生物之上。",
	"A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm's reach as it waits to attack again.": "蓝龙是一个有耐心和方法的战斗者。当以自己的方式战斗时，它会把战斗变成一个长达数小时甚至数天的事情，从远处以闪电的方式进行攻击，然后在等待再次攻击时飞离伤害范围。",
	"Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.": "虽然它们有时会吃仙人掌和其他沙漠植物来满足它们巨大的饥饿感，但蓝龙是食肉动物。它们更喜欢吃群居动物，在大快朵颐之前用它们的闪电气息烹饪这些生物。它们的饮食习惯使蓝龙成为沙漠商队和游牧部落的巨大威胁，在龙的眼里，这些商队和部落都是方便的食物和财宝的集合体。",
	"When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.": "狩猎时，蓝龙把自己埋在沙漠的沙子里，只有鼻子上的角露出水面，看起来就像一块突出的石头。当猎物靠近时，龙就会站起来，在攻击时，沙子会像雪崩一样从它的翅膀上涌出。",
	"Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.": "蓝龙垂涎有价值和有才华的生物，他们的服务能加强他们的优越感。吟游诗人、法师、艺术家、巫师和刺客都可以成为蓝龙的有价值的代理人，蓝龙会对忠诚的服务给予丰厚的回报。",
	"A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.": "蓝龙将自己的巢穴保密并保护得很好，即使是它最信任的仆人也很少被允许进入。它鼓励阿克塞斯、巨蝎和其他沙漠生物居住在它的巢穴附近，以增加安全感。年长的蓝龙有时会吸引空气元素和其他生物为其服务。",
	"Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewelery and magic items adorned with those gems.": "虽然蓝龙收集任何看起来有价值的东西，但他们特别喜欢宝石。他们认为蓝色是最高贵和最美丽的颜色，他们觊觎蓝宝石，喜欢用这些宝石装饰的珠宝和魔法物品。",

	"Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon's lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon's first line of defense.": "雷暴在一条传奇蓝龙的巢穴周围肆虐，狭窄的管道里铺着玻璃般的沙子，为巢穴通风，同时避开致命的天坑，这是龙的第一道防线。",

When it returns later, it collects its possessions-along with the wealth of the dead intruders.": "如果蓝龙的巢穴被入侵，它就会把构成其巢穴的洞穴弄塌。然后，龙会钻出洞穴，让攻击者被压死和窒息。当它后来回来时，它会收集它的财产--连同死去的入侵者的财富。",
	"The bone hooks that protrude from the back of a blue slaad's hands inflict a terrible transformative disease on humanoids wounded by them. This infection, called chaos phage, transforms its victim into a fully grown red slaad—or green slaad if the host was a spellcaster able to cast 3rd level spells or higher.": "从蓝袍人的手背上伸出的骨钩，会给被其伤害的人类带来一种可怕的转化疾病。这种被称为 \"混沌噬菌体 \"的传染病会将受害者转化为一个完全成熟的红袍人--如果宿主是一个能够施展三级以上法术的施法者，那么就是绿袍人。",
	"Driven by hate, lust, and envy, bone devils act as the cruel taskmasters of the Nine Hells. They set weaker devils to work, taking special delight in seeing fiends that defy them demoted. At the same time, they long for promotion and are bitterly envious of their superiors, attempting to curry favor though it irks them to do so.": "在仇恨、欲望和嫉妒的驱使下，骨魔成为九层地狱中残酷的任务主管。他们让弱小的魔鬼工作，特别乐于看到违抗他们的魔鬼被降级。同时，他们渴望晋升，对他们的上级有强烈的嫉妒心，试图讨好他们，尽管这样做会使他们感到不安。",
	"A bone devil appears as a humanoid husk, with dried skin stretched tight across its skeletal frame. It bears a fearsome skull-like head and the tail of a scorpion, and a foul odor of decay hangs in the air around it. Though they are devastating in combat with their claws, bone devils also wield hooked polearms made of bone, which they use to subdue enemies before striking with their venomous tails.": "骨魔出现时是一个人形的躯壳，干枯的皮肤紧紧地贴在它的骨架上。它有一个可怕的骷髅头和蝎子的尾巴，周围的空气中弥漫着一股腐烂的恶臭味。虽然它们的爪子在战斗中是毁灭性的，但骨魔也挥舞着由骨头制成的钩状杆状武器，在用它们的毒液尾巴攻击之前，它们用这些武器制服敌人。",
	"In response to the long history of conflict between the yuan-ti and the nagas, yuan-ti created a necromantic ritual that could halt a naga's resurrection by transforming the living naga into a skeletal undead servitor. A bone naga retains only a few of the spells it knew in life.": "为了应对元帝和纳迦人之间长期以来的冲突，元帝创造了一种亡灵仪式，可以通过将活着的纳迦变成一个骷髅般的不死仆从来阻止纳迦的复活。骨质纳迦只保留了它生前知道的一些法术。",

	"The first nagas were created as immortal guardians by a humanoid race long lost to history.

	" Nagas have a long-standing enmity with the yuan-ti, with each race seeing itself as the epitome of serpentine evolution. Though cooperation between them is rare, nagas and yuan-ti sometimes set aside their differences to work toward common objectives. However, yuan-ti always chafe under a naga's authority.": " 纳迦人与元天人有着长期的敌意，每个种族都将自己视为蛇类进化的缩影。虽然他们之间的合作很少，但纳迦和元天有时会搁置他们的分歧，为共同的目标而努力。然而，元帝总是在纳迦的权威下感到不安。",

	"A brass dragon's head is defined by the broad protective plate that expands from its forehead and the spikes protruding from its chin. A frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down the length of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling's scales are a dull, mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon's scales begin to shine, eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster. Its wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As a brass dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs.": "黄铜龙的头部是由从其前额扩展出来的宽大的保护板和从其下巴突出的尖刺所界定的。它的脖子上有一条流苏，其渐变的翅膀一直延伸到尾巴的长度。黄铜龙的鳞片是一种暗淡的、斑驳的棕色。随着年龄的增长，龙的鳞片开始发亮，最终呈现出温暖、灼热的光泽。它的翅膀和褶皱的边缘是斑驳的绿色，随着年龄的增长而变暗。随着黄铜龙的年龄增长，它的瞳孔逐渐缩小，直到它的眼睛像熔化的金属球。",
	"A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughout its long life, accumulating useful information which it will gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligent creature tries to leave a brass dragon's presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon's thirst for small talk is slaked.": "黄铜龙在其漫长的一生中与数以千计的生物进行对话，积累有用的信息，并乐意分享这些信息以换取财宝。如果一个聪明的生物试图离开铜龙的存在而不进行对话，铜龙就会跟踪它。如果该生物试图用魔法或武力逃跑，龙可能会以愤怒的方式回应，用它的睡眠气体使该生物失去能力。当它醒来时，生物会发现自己被巨大的爪子钉在地上，或者被埋在沙子里，而龙对闲谈的渴求却被满足了。",

When that happens, the dragon often responds in kind, treating a bout of mutual trickery as a game.": "铜龙对那些看起来和它一样喜欢谈话的生物充满信任，但它很聪明，知道自己什么时候被操纵了。当这种情况发生时，铜龙往往会以牙还牙，把相互间的诡计当作一场游戏来对待。",

An intelligent telepathic weapon or a magic lamp with a djinni bound inside it are among the greatest treasures a brass dragon can possess.": "黄铜龙垂涎那些能让他们与有趣的人交流的魔法物品。一件智能心灵感应的武器或一盏捆绑着精灵的魔法灯是黄铜龙可以拥有的最伟大的宝物之一。",
	"Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps. Adventurers and wanderers should be wary if they happen across a chest hidden in an oasis or a treasure cache tucked away in a half-buried desert ruin, for these might be parts of a brass dragon's hoard.": "铜龙将它们的宝藏藏在沙堆下，或藏在远离它们主要巢穴的秘密地方。他们不难记住他们的宝藏埋在哪里，因此不需要地图。如果冒险者和流浪者偶然发现了藏在绿洲中的箱子或藏在半掩埋的沙漠废墟中的宝藏，他们应该保持警惕，因为这可能是铜龙囤积的一部分。",

They are also fascinated by warfare and eagerly join armies fighting for a just cause.": "青铜龙是沿海居民，主要以水生植物和鱼类为食。它们采取友好动物的形式来观察其他感兴趣的生物。它们也对战争着迷，热衷于加入为正义事业而战的军队。",
	"A ribbed and fluted crest defines the shape of a bronze dragon's head. Curving horns extend out from the crest, echoed by spines on its lower jaw and chin. To help them swim, bronze dragons have webbed feet and smooth scales. A bronze wyrmling's scales are yellow tinged with green; only as the dragon approaches adulthood does its color deepen to a darker, rich bronze tone. The pupils of a bronze dragon's eyes fade as the dragon ages, until they resemble glowing green orbs.": "一个有棱有角的徽章确定了青铜龙的头部形状。弯曲的角从峰顶延伸出来，与下颌和下巴上的刺相呼应。为了帮助它们游泳，青铜龙有带蹼的脚和光滑的鳞片。青铜龙的鳞片是带有绿色的黄色；只有当龙接近成年时，它的颜色才会加深到更深、更丰富的青铜色调。青铜龙的瞳孔会随着年龄的增长而变淡，直到它们像发光的绿色球体。",
	"Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the ship's captain for the item.": "青铜龙喜欢观察在其巢穴附近的海岸线上行驶的船只，有时会化身为海豚或海鸥，更仔细地检查这些船只及其船员。大胆的青铜龙可能会化身为鸟或老鼠溜上一艘船，检查船舱里的财宝。如果青铜龙发现了值得收藏的东西，它就会与船长进行交易，以获得该物品。",
	"Bronze dragons actively oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by putting their size and strength to good use.

Once a bronze dragon commits to a cause, it remains a staunch ally.": "青铜龙积极反对暴政，许多青铜龙渴望通过善用自己的体型和力量来测试自己的能力。当冲突在其巢穴附近展开时，青铜龙会确定其根本原因，然后向任何为善而战的一方提供服务。一旦青铜龙致力于一项事业，它就会成为坚定的盟友。",
	" Bronze dragons loot sunken ships and also collect colorful coral and pearls from the reefs and seabeds near their lairs. When a bronze dragon pledges to help an army wage war against tyranny, it asks for nominal payment. If such a request is beyond its allies' means, it might settle for a collection of old books on military history or a ceremonial item commemorating the alliance. A bronze dragon might also lay claim to a treasure held by the enemy that it feels would be safer under its protection.": " 青铜龙掠夺沉船，也从其巢穴附近的礁石和海床上收集五颜六色的珊瑚和珍珠。当青铜龙承诺帮助一支军队对暴政发动战争时，它要求得到象征性的报酬。如果这种要求超出了它的盟友的能力，它可能会以收集军事历史方面的旧书或纪念联盟的仪式物品作为补偿。青铜龙也可能对敌人持有的财宝提出要求，它认为在它的保护下会更安全。",
	"A bronze dragon lairs in coastal caves. It might salvage a wrecked ship, reconstruct it within the confines of its lair, and use it as a treasure vault or nest for its eggs.": "青铜龙在沿海的洞穴中筑巢。它可能会打捞出一艘失事的船只，在其巢穴的范围内进行重建，并将其作为宝库或蛋的巢穴。",

	"Bugbears are often found in the company of their cousins, hobgoblins and goblins. Bugbears usually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when paid, bugbears are at best unreliable allies, yet goblins and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much bugbears might drain a tribe of resources, these creatures are a potent force.": "虫熊经常与它们的表亲霍布林和地精在一起。虫熊通常会奴役他们遇到的地精，他们欺负地精给他们黄金和食物，作为侦察兵和冲击部队的回报。即使有了钱，虫熊充其量也是不可靠的盟友，然而地精和妖精明白，无论虫熊如何消耗部落的资源，这些生物都是一种强大的力量。",
	"Bugbears worship Hruggek, a lesser god who dwells on the plane of Acheron. In the absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance to fight at Hruggek's side. They try to prove themselves worthy by defeating as many foes as possible.": "虫族崇拜Hruggek，他是居住在Acheron平面上的一个较小的神。在没有地精亲属的情况下，虫族组成了松散的战队，每个战队由其最凶猛的成员领导。虫人相信，当他们死后，他们的灵魂有机会在赫鲁格克身边战斗。他们试图通过击败尽可能多的敌人来证明自己的价值。",
	"Despite their intimidating builds, bugbears move with surprising stealth. They are fond of setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any bond when its life is on the line. A wounded member of a bugbear band might be left behind to help the rest of the band escape. Afterward, that bugbear might help pursuers track down its former companions if doing so saves its life.": "尽管它们的身材令人生畏，但虫熊的行动却令人惊讶地隐蔽。他们喜欢设下埋伏，在不敌的情况下逃跑。只要有食物、饮料和财宝供应，它们就是可靠的雇佣兵，但当生命危在旦夕的时候，虫熊就会忘记任何纽带。一个受伤的虫族成员可能会被留下来帮助其他成员逃跑。之后，这只虫熊可能会帮助追捕者追踪它以前的同伴，如果这样做能救它的命的话。",
	"A bulette is a massive predator that terrorizes any lands it inhabits. Also called a \"land shark,\" it lives only to feed. Irascible and rapacious, bulettes fear no other creature, and they attack with no regard for superior numbers or strength.": "布莱特是一种巨大的捕食者，它使它所居住的任何土地都感到恐怖。它也被称为 \"陆上鲨鱼\"，只为觅食而生。无情而贪婪，布列特不惧怕其他生物，它们的攻击不考虑数量和力量的优势。",
	"Bulettes use their powerful claws to tunnel through the earth when they hunt. Heedless of obstruction, they uproot trees, cause landslides in loose slopes, and leave sinkholes behind them. When vibrations in the soil and rock alert a bulette to movement, it shoots to the surface, its jaws spread wide as it attacks.": "Bulettes在捕猎时用它们强大的爪子在土里挖隧道。它们不顾阻碍，将树木连根拔起，在松散的斜坡上造成山体滑坡，并在身后留下天坑。当土壤和岩石的振动提醒布列特的运动时，它就会射向地面，在攻击时张开它的下巴。",
	"A bulette ranges across temperate lands, feeding on any animals and humanoids it comes across. These creatures dislike dwarf and elf flesh, although they often kill them before realizing what they are. A bulette loves halfling meat the most, and it is never happier than when chasing plump halflings across an open field.": "布莱特在温带土地上活动，以它遇到的任何动物和人形生物为食。这些生物不喜欢矮人和精灵的肉，尽管它们经常在意识到它们是什么之前就杀死它们。布里特最喜欢半身人的肉，当它在空旷的田野上追逐丰满的半身人时，从来没有比这更快乐的了。",
	"A bulette has no lair, but roams a hunting territory up to thirty miles wide. Its sole criterion for territory is availability of food, and when it has eaten everything in an area, a bulette moves on. These creatures often home in on humanoid settlements, terrorizing them until their panicked residents have fled, or until the bulette is slain.": "布列塔尼没有巢穴，而是在一个宽达30英里的狩猎区漫游。它对领地的唯一标准是是否有食物，当它吃完一个地区的所有东西后，布莱特就会继续前进。这些生物经常在人形定居点附近活动，恐吓他们，直到他们惊慌失措的居民逃离，或者直到布莱特被杀死。",
	"All creatures shun bulettes, which treat anything that moves as food-even other predators and bulettes. Bulettes come together only to mate, resulting in a bloody act of claws and teeth that usually ends with the male's death and consumption.": "所有的生物都避开Bulettes，它们把任何会动的东西都当作食物，甚至是其他捕食者和Bulettes。猎犬只有在交配时才会聚集在一起，导致爪子和牙齿的血腥行为，通常以雄性猎犬的死亡和消耗而结束。",
	"Some sages believe the bulette is the result of a mad wizard's experiments at crossbreeding snapping turtles and armadillos, within fusions of demon ichor. Bulettes have been thought to be extinct at different times, but after years without a sighting, the creatures inevitably reappear. Because their young are almost never seen, some sages suspect that bulettes maintain secret nesting grounds from which adults strike out into the world.": "一些圣人认为，布列特是一个疯狂的巫师在融合了恶魔胆汁的情况下，对鳄龟和犰狳进行杂交实验的结果。布列特在不同时期被认为已经灭绝，但在多年未见的情况下，这种生物不可避免地重新出现。由于它们的幼崽几乎从未被人看见，一些圣人怀疑Bulettes保持着秘密的巢穴，而成年的Bulettes则从那里向世界出击。",
	"Life as a bullywug is nasty, brutish, and wet. These frog-headed amphibious humanoids must stay constantly moist, dwelling in rainy forests, marshes, and damp caves. Always hungry and thoroughly evil, bullywugs overwhelm opponents with superior numbers when they can, but they flee from serious threats to search for easier prey.": "霸王虫的生活是讨厌的、残酷的、潮湿的。这些蛙头两栖类动物必须经常保持湿润，居住在多雨的森林、沼泽地和潮湿的洞穴里。霸王虫总是很饿，也很邪恶，当它们能够以优势的数量压倒对手时，它们就会逃离严重的威胁，去寻找更容易的猎物。",
	"Bullywugs have green, gray, or mottled yellow skin that shifts through shades of gray, green, and brown, allowing them to blend in with their surroundings. They wear crude armor and wield simple weapons, and can deliver a powerful bite to foes that press too close.": "霸王龙有绿色、灰色或斑驳的黄色皮肤，在灰色、绿色和棕色的阴影中变换，使它们能够与周围环境融合。它们穿着粗糙的盔甲，挥舞着简单的武器，并能对逼得太近的敌人发出强有力的撕咬。",
	"Bullywugs consider themselves the right and proper rulers of the swamps. They follow an etiquette of sorts when dealing with outsiders and each other, subject to the whims and fancies of their leader-a self-styled lord of the muck. Bullywugs introduce themselves with grand-sounding titles, make great shows of bowing and debasing themselves before their superiors, and endlessly vie to win their superiors' favor.": "小霸王认为自己是沼泽地的正确和适当的统治者。他们在与外人和彼此打交道时遵循某种礼仪，服从于他们的领袖--一个自诩为泥沼之王的人的奇思妙想和幻想。恶霸用冠冕堂皇的头衔来介绍自己，在他们的上级面前大肆鞠躬和贬低自己，并无休止地争夺他们上级的青睐。",
	"A bullywug has two ways to advance among its kind. It can either murder its rivals, though it must take pains to keep its criminal deeds secret, or it can find a treasure or magic item and present it as tribute or a token of obeisance to its liege. A bullywug that murders its rivals without cunning is likely to be executed, so it's more common for bullywugs to stage raids against caravans and settlements, with the goal of securing precious baubles to impress their lords and win their good graces. Invariably, such fine goods are reduced to filthy tatters through abuse and neglect. Once a gift loses its sheen, a bullywug lord invariably demands that its subjects bring it more treasure as tribute.": "恶霸虫有两种方法在同类中取得进步。它可以谋杀对手，尽管它必须努力保持其犯罪行为的秘密，或者它可以找到一个宝藏或魔法物品，并将其作为贡品或向其主子表示敬意的象征。恶霸虫如果不狡猾地谋杀对手，很可能会被处死，所以恶霸虫更常见的是对商队和定居点进行突袭，目的是获得珍贵的宝物，以打动其领主，赢得他们的好感。无可避免的是，这些精美的物品会因为虐待和忽视而变成肮脏的破烂。一旦礼物失去光泽，恶霸领主总是要求其臣民带来更多的财宝作为贡品。",
	"Bullywugs love nothing more than lording over those who trespass on their territories. Their warriors attempt to capture intruders rather than simply slaying them.": "霸王龙最喜欢的就是霸占那些闯入他们领土的人。他们的战士试图捕获入侵者，而不是简单地杀了他们。",
	"Captives are dragged before the king or queen-a bullywug of unusually large size-and forced to beg for mercy. Bribes, treasure, and flattery can trick the bullywug ruler into letting its captives go, but not before it tries to impress its \"guests\" with the majesty of its treasure and its realm. Struck with a deep inferiority complex, bullywug lords fancy themselves as kings and queens, but desperately crave the fear and respect of outsiders.": "俘虏被拖到国王或王后面前--体型异常庞大的恶霸虫，被迫求饶。贿赂、财宝和奉承可以诱使恶霸虫统治者放走俘虏，但在它试图用它的财宝和王国的威严来打动它的 \"客人 \"之前。霸王虫统治者被深深的自卑感所打动，他们自诩为国王和王后，却极度渴望得到外人的恐惧和尊重。",
	"Bullywugs speak a language that allows them to communicate over large areas by croaking like frogs. News of intruders or other events in the swamp spread within minutes across this crude communication system.": "霸王龙说一种语言，使它们能够像青蛙一样通过呱呱叫在大范围内交流。沼泽地里的入侵者或其他事件的消息在几分钟内就会通过这种粗糙的通信系统传播。",
	"Simple concepts in the language are understandable to frogs and toads. Bullywugs use this capability to form strong bonds with giant frogs, which they train as guardians and hunters. Larger specimens are sometimes used as mounts as well. The frogs' ability to swallow creatures whole provides a bullywug hunting band an easy means of carrying prey back to their villages.": "语言中的简单概念对青蛙和蟾蜍来说是可以理解的。霸王蛙利用这种能力与巨蛙形成牢固的联系，他们把巨蛙训练成守护者和猎手。较大的标本有时也被用来作为坐骑。青蛙整只吞下生物的能力为恶霸蛙的狩猎队提供了一种将猎物带回村庄的简单手段。",
	"A cambion is the offspring of a fiend (usually a succubus or incubus) and a humanoid (usually a human). Cambions inherit aspects of both parents, but their horns, leathery wings, and sinewy tails are hallmarks of their otherworldly parentage.": "cambion是恶魔（通常是魅魔或妖怪）和类人（通常是人类）的后代。坎比恩继承了父母双方的某些方面，但他们的角、皮质的翅膀和蜿蜒的尾巴是他们异世界的父母的标志。",
	"Cambions grow into ruthless adults whose wickedness and perversion horrifies even the most devoted mortal parent. Even as a youth, a cambion identifies its rightful place as an overlord of mortals.

	"A cambion forced to serve its fiendish parent does so out of admiration and dread, but also with the expectation that it will one day rise to a place of prominence.

In the Abyss, a cambion carries only as much authority as it can muster through sheer strength and force of will.": "被迫为其恶魔父母服务的坎比恩是出于钦佩和恐惧，但也期望有一天它能升到一个显赫的位置。在九层地狱中长大的坎贝尔作为士兵、特使和更大的恶魔的私人随从。在深渊中，一个坎贝尔只能通过纯粹的力量和意志力来获得尽可能多的权力。",
	"The demon lord Graz'zt is fond of procreating with humanoids who have made pacts with fiends, and he has sired many cambions who help him sow chaos across the multiverse. These cambions are characterized by charcoal-black skin, cloven hooves, six-fingered hands, and unearthly beauty.": "恶魔领主格拉兹兹特（Graz'zt）喜欢与那些与恶魔签订了契约的人类繁衍后代，他孕育了许多帮助他在多元宇宙中播种混乱的cambions。这些cambions的特点是炭黑的皮肤、蹄子、六指的手和超凡脱俗的美貌。",
	"Carrion crawlers scour putrid flesh from carcasses and gobble the slimy bones that remain. They aggressively attack any creature that trespasses on their territory or disturbs their feasting.": "腐尸爬虫从尸体上搜出腐烂的肉，并吞食残留的粘稠的骨头。它们积极地攻击任何闯入它们领地或打扰它们进食的生物。",
	"A carrion crawler follows the scent of death to its food, but it prefers not to compete with other scavengers. These foul creatures thus hunker down in territories where death is plentiful and other carrion eaters have limited mobility. Caves, sewers, dungeons, and forested marshes are their favored lairs, but carrion crawlers are also drawn to battlefields and cemeteries. A carrion crawler roams on the hunt, its tentacles probing the air for the scent of blood or decay. In tunnels or ruins, carrion crawlers scurry across the ceiling as they move toward food. In this way, they avoid contact with oozes, otyughs, and other dangerous inhabitants of the darkness, even as they surprise potential meals that don't think to look up.": "腐肉爬虫循着死亡的气味找到它的食物，但它更喜欢不与其他食腐动物竞争。因此，这些肮脏的生物蜷缩在死亡多的地方，而其他食腐动物的流动性有限。洞穴、下水道、地牢和森林沼泽是它们最喜欢的巢穴，但腐尸爬行者也会被吸引到战场和墓地。腐尸爬行者在狩猎中漫游，它的触角在空气中探寻血腥或腐烂的气味。在隧道或废墟中，腐尸爬虫在走向食物时，会在天花板上乱窜。通过这种方式，它们可以避免接触到渗出物、Otyughs和其他黑暗中的危险居民，甚至让那些没有想到要抬头看的潜在食物感到惊讶。",
	"Whether in subterranean darkness or while hunting at night, light signals a potential meal. A carrion crawler might follow a light source from a distance for hours, hoping to pick up the scent of blood. Despite their great size, carrion crawlers can also easily set up ambushes by waiting around blind corners for prey to come to them. When facing potential prey or intruders, a carrion crawler lets its poison do the work. Once a victim goes rigid with paralysis, the carrion crawler wraps it with its tentacles and drags it away to a high ledge or isolated passageway, where it can be killed safely. The monster then resumes patrolling its territory while waiting for its meal to ripen.": "无论是在地下的黑暗中，还是在夜间狩猎时，光线都是潜在的食物的信号。腐肉爬虫可能会从远处跟踪一个光源几个小时，希望能闻到血的气味。尽管腐肉爬虫的体型很大，但它们也可以很容易地设下埋伏，在盲目的角落里等待猎物来找它们。当面对潜在的猎物或入侵者时，腐尸爬虫会让它的毒药发挥作用。一旦受害者因麻痹而变得僵硬，腐尸爬虫就会用它的触手将其包裹起来，并将其拖到高处的壁架或孤立的通道，在那里可以安全地将其杀死。然后，这只怪物继续在其领地上巡逻，同时等待它的食物成熟。",
	"I hear centaurs make excellent mounts!": "我听说半人马是很好的坐骑!",

	"Centaur tribes range across lands with mild to hot climates, where a centaur requires only light furs or oiled skins to deal with inclement weather. They are hunter-gatherers and rarely build shelters or even use tents.": "半人马部落分布在气候温和到炎热的土地上，半人马只需要轻薄的毛皮或涂油的皮毛来应对恶劣的天气。他们是狩猎采集者，很少建造庇护所，甚至不使用帐篷。",
	"Centaur migrations span continents and take decades to repeat, so that a centaur tribe might not retread the same path for generations. These long-ranging patterns can lead to conflict when centaurs encounter settlements of other creatures built along their traditional routes.": "半人马的迁徙跨越大陆，需要几十年的时间来重复，所以一个半人马部落可能几代人都不会重走同样的道路。当半人马遇到其他生物在其传统路线上建造的定居点时，这些长距离的模式会导致冲突。",
	"A centaur that can't keep pace with the rest of its tribe is left behind. Some such centaurs vanish into the wilderness and are never seen again. Those that can bear the loss of their tribe might take up residence among other races. Frontier settlements value the nature knowledge of their centaur residents. Many such communities owe their survival to the insight and acumen of a centaur.": "一个半人马如果不能跟上其他部落的步伐，就会被甩在后面。一些这样的半人马消失在荒野中，再也见不到了。那些能够忍受失去部落的人可能会在其他种族中居住。边疆定居点重视半人马居民的自然知识。许多这样的社区的生存归功于半人马的洞察力和敏锐度。",
	"Despite their reclusive nature, centaurs trade with elves and with the caravans of other benevolent humanoids they meet during their wanderings.

	"This ominous fiend wears chains like a shroud. Driving lesser creatures before it with its fearsome gaze, a chain devil animates the chains that cover its body as well as inanimate chains nearby, which sprout hooks, blades, and spikes to eviscerate enemies.": "这个不祥的恶魔像裹尸布一样戴着链子。链魔用它可怕的目光驱赶着面前的低等生物，使覆盖在它身上的链子以及附近的无生命的链子都有了活力，这些链子长出了钩子、刀片和尖刺，可以将敌人斩杀。",
	"Chain devils act as sadistic jailers and torturers in the infernal realms, relishing pain and living to inflict it on others. They are called on to torment mortal souls trapped in the Nine Hells, inflicting their sadistic fury on the horrid lemures in which those souls manifest.": "链魔在地狱界充当虐待狂的狱卒和折磨者，以痛苦为乐，以折磨他人为生。他们被要求折磨被困在九层地狱的凡人灵魂，将他们的虐待狂怒气施加在这些灵魂所表现出来的可怕的雷姆身上。",
	"This loathsome demon resembles an unspeakable crossing of humanoid and fly. A chasme shuffles about on four spindly legs that can find purchase on walls and ceilings. A droning sound precedes the approach of a chasme, inflicting foes with a terrible lethargy that leaves them open to attack.": "这种令人厌恶的恶魔类似于一种难以言喻的人形和苍蝇的混合体。查斯梅用四条骨瘦如柴的腿来回走动，可以在墙壁和天花板上找到支撑。在chasme接近之前，会有一阵阵沉闷的声音，给敌人带来可怕的昏睡感，让他们有机会受到攻击。",
	"The lowly chasmes serve more powerful masters as interrogators or taskmasters. A chasme lives to dole out torture as punishment, and has a knack for spotting demons that have deserted their lords. Capturing and returning such traitors allows a chasme to torment the victim without fear of reprisal.": "卑微的查斯米为更强大的主人服务，作为审讯者或任务负责人。查斯姆以施展酷刑为生，并善于发现那些抛弃主人的恶魔。捕获并归还这些叛徒可以让查斯梅在不担心报复的情况下对受害者进行折磨。",
	"Chimeras were created after mortals summoned Demogorgon to the world. The Prince of Demons, unimpressed with the creatures that surrounded it, transformed them into horrific, multi-headed monstrosities. This act gave rise to the first chimeras.": "嵌合体是在凡人将德摩根召唤到这个世界后产生的。恶魔王子对周围的生物不以为然，将它们变成了可怕的多头怪物。这一行为催生了第一批嵌合体。",
	"Gifted with demonic cruelty, a chimera serves as a grim reminder of what happens when demon princes find their way to the Material Plane. A typical specimen has the hindquarters of a large goat, the forequarters of a lion, and the leathery wings of a dragon, along with the heads of all three of those creatures. The monster likes to surprise its victims, swooping down from the sky and engulfing prey with its fiery breath before landing.": "奇美拉被赋予了恶魔的残忍，它是恶魔王子找到物质世界的途径时的一个严峻的提醒。典型的奇美拉有大山羊的后躯，狮子的前躯，龙的皮翼，以及这三种生物的头。这种怪物喜欢给受害者一个惊喜，从空中俯冲而下，在落地前用火热的气息吞噬猎物。",
	"A chimera combines the worst aspects of its three parts. Its dragon head drives it to raid, plunder, and accumulate a great hoard. Its leonine nature compels it to hunt and kill powerful creatures that threaten its territory. Its goat head grants it a vicious, stubborn streak that compels it to fight to the death. These three aspects drive a chimera to stake out a territory that is as large as 10 miles wide. It preys on wild game, viewing more powerful creatures as rivals to be humiliated and defeated. Its greatest rivals are dragons, griffons, manticores, perytons, and wyverns. When it hunts, the chimera looks for easy ways to amuse itself. It enjoys the fear and suffering of weaker creatures. The monster often toys with its prey, breaking off an attack prematurely and leaving a creature wounded and terrified before returning to finish it off.": "奇美拉结合了其三个部分的最坏方面。它的龙首驱使它突袭、掠夺和积累大量的囤积物。它的龙性迫使它猎杀威胁其领土的强大生物。它的山羊头赋予它恶毒、顽固的性格，迫使它战斗到死。这三个方面促使奇美拉划定一个宽达10英里的领土。它以野生动物为食，将更多强大的生物视为需要羞辱和击败的对手。它最大的对手是龙、狮鹫、曼蒂克龙、Perytons和翼龙。当它狩猎时，奇美拉会寻找简单的方法来消遣自己。它喜欢弱小生物的恐惧和痛苦。这种怪物经常玩弄它的猎物，过早地中断攻击，让一个生物受伤和惊恐，然后再回来把它干掉。",
	"Though chimeras are far from cunning, their draconic ego makes them susceptible to flattery and gifts. If offered food and treasure, a chimera might spare a traveler. A villain can lure a chimera into service by keeping it well fed and its treasure hoard well stocked.": "虽然奇美拉远非狡猾，但他们的龙族自我意识使他们容易受到奉承和礼物的影响。如果提供食物和财宝，奇美拉可能会放过一个旅行者。恶棍可以引诱奇美拉为其服务，让它吃饱喝足，让它的财宝囤积起来。",
	"The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.": "黑龙、蓝龙、绿龙、红龙和白龙代表了龙族的邪恶面。侵略性强、贪吃、虚荣，色龙是黑暗的圣人和强大的暴君，为所有生物所惧怕--包括彼此之间。",
	" Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.": " 色素龙贪恋财宝，这种贪婪使他们的每一个计划和阴谋都充满色彩。他们认为，世界上的财富理所当然地属于他们，而色龙夺取这些财富时，并不考虑那些 \"偷走 \"财富的人类和其他生物。凭借成堆的硬币、闪闪发光的宝石和魔法物品，龙的囤积物是传说中的东西。然而，色龙对商业没有兴趣，它们积累财富的原因无非是为了拥有它。",
	"Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.": "色素龙因其优越感而团结在一起，认为自己是所有凡人生物中最强大和最有价值的。当他们与其他生物互动时，只是为了促进自己的利益。他们相信自己有与生俱来的统治权，这种信念是每条色龙的个性和世界观的基石。试图羞辱一条色龙就像试图说服风停止吹动。对这些生物来说，人类是动物，适合作为猎物或负担的野兽，完全不值得尊重。",
	"A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.": "龙的巢穴是其权力的所在地，也是其财宝的保险库。凭借其天生的坚韧和对严重环境影响的耐受力，龙选择或建造巢穴的目的不是为了避难，而是为了防御，倾向于多个入口和出口，并为其囤积物提供安全保障。",
	"Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.": "大多数色龙的巢穴都隐藏在危险和偏远的地方，除了最大胆的凡人之外，其他的人都无法接近它们。黑龙的巢穴可能在一个巨大的沼泽中心，而红龙则可能在一座活火山的破火山口上。除了巢穴的自然防御外，强大的色龙还使用魔法守护者、陷阱和顺从的生物来保护它们的宝藏。",
	"Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells.

	"Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.": "提亚马特是一条巨大的龙，她的五个头反映了崇拜她的色龙的形态--黑色、蓝色、绿色、红色和白色。她是战场上的恐怖，能够用她的五种呼吸武器、可怕的法术和可怕的爪子消灭整个军队。",

	"In the primeval ages, aboleths ruled a vast empire that spanned the oceans of the world. In those days, the aboleths used mighty magic and bent the minds of the nascent creatures of the mortal realm. However, they were bound to the water and could not enforce their will beyond it without servants. Therefore, they created chuuls.": "在原始时代，阿波利斯统治着一个横跨世界各大洋的庞大帝国。在那些日子里，阿波勒斯使用强大的魔法，并屈服于凡人界新生生物的思想。然而，他们被束缚在水中，没有仆人就无法在水面上执行他们的意志。因此，他们创造了丘尔。",
	"Perfectly obedient, the chuuls collected sentient creatures and magic at the aboleths' command. Chuuls were designed to endure the ages of the world, growing in size and strength as the eons passed. When the aboleths' empire crumbled with the rise of the gods, the chuuls were cast adrift. However, these creatures continue to do what they did for the aboleths, slowly collecting humanoids, gathering treasure, amassing magic, and consolidating power.": "Chuuls完全服从命令，在aboleths的指挥下收集有生命的生物和魔法。Chuuls被设计成能够经受住世界的岁月考验，随着时间的推移，它们的体型和力量都在不断增长。当boleths的帝国随着众神的崛起而瓦解时，chuuls被抛在了海上。然而，这些生物继续做着他们为aboleths所做的事情，慢慢地收集人类，收集宝藏，积累魔法，并巩固权力。",

Rumors and ancient maps sometimes lure treasure seekers to these ruins, but the reward for their boldness is death.": "楚尔人仍然守卫着古老的阿波利斯帝国的废墟。他们默默地遵守着古老的命令而徘徊。谣言和古老的地图有时会引诱寻宝者来到这些废墟，但对他们的大胆行为的回报是死亡。",
	"Whatever riches that the explorers bring with them adds to the hoard guarded by the chuuls. Chuuls can sense magic at a distance. This sense couples with an innate drive that leads them to slay explorers, take their gear, and bury it in secret locales aboleths dictated eons ago.": "无论探险者带来什么财富，都会增加楚乌尔人所守护的囤积物。丘尔人可以在远处感知魔法。这种感觉与一种与生俱来的驱动力相结合，导致他们杀死探险家，拿走他们的装备，并将其埋藏在远古时代所指定的秘密地点。",
	"Although the aboleths' ancient empire fell long ago, the psychic bonds between them and their created servants remain intact. Chuuls that come into contact with aboleths immediately assume their old roles.

	"They order lesser giants to seek out wealth and art on their behalf, employing fire giants as smiths and crafters, and using frost giants as reavers, raiders, and plunderers. Dimwitted hill giants serve them as brutes and combat fodder-sometimes fighting for the cloud giants' amusement. A cloud giant might order hill or frost giants to steal from nearby humanoid lands, which it considers to be a fair tax for its continued beneficence.

Such creatures also patrol the cloud giants' gardens by night, along with trained predators such as owlbears and lions.": "就像人形贵族为狩猎鹰保留了一个小房间一样，云巨人也保留了狮鹫、perytons和狼獾作为他们自己的飞行猎物。这些生物也会在夜间巡逻云巨人的花园，同时还有训练有素的捕食者，如猫头鹰和狮子。",
	"The patron god and father of the cloud giants is Memnor the Trickster, the cleverest and slyest of the giant deities. Cloud giants align themselves according to the aspects and exploits of Memnor that they most admire, with evil cloud giants emulating his deceitfulness and self-interest and good cloud giants emulating his intellect and silver-tongued speech. Family members usually align in the same direction.": "云雾巨人的守护神和父亲是诡计多端的梅姆诺，他是最聪明、最狡猾的巨人神。云巨人根据他们最崇拜的梅姆诺的方面和功绩来结盟，邪恶的云巨人模仿他的欺骗和自我利益，善良的云巨人模仿他的智慧和银舌。家庭成员通常向同一方向看齐。",
	"A cloud giant earns its place in the ordning by the treasure it accumulates, the wealth it wears, and the gifts it bestows on other cloud giants.": "一个云端巨人通过其积累的宝藏、佩戴的财富和给予其他云端巨人的礼物来赢得其在条例中的地位。",
	"However, value is only one part of the assessment. The extravagances a cloud giant wears or places about its home must also be beautiful or wondrous. Sacks of gold or gems are worth less to a cloud giant than the jewelry that might be crafted from those materials, creating treasures that bring esteem to a cloud giant's household.": "然而，价值只是评估的一个部分。云雾巨人所穿戴的或摆放在家中的奢侈物品也必须是美丽或奇妙的。对云巨人来说，一袋金子或宝石的价值不如用这些材料制作的珠宝，创造的宝物能给云巨人的家庭带来尊贵。",
	"Rather than steal from one another or fight over treasures, cloud giants are inveterate gamblers with a hunger for high risks and high rewards. They frequently bet on the outcome of events nominally outside their control, such as the lives of lesser creatures. Ordning ranks and kings' ransoms can be won and lost in bets over the military triumphs of humanoid nations. Fixing wagers by interfering in the conflict causes the loss of the bet, but such deceit is considered to be cheating only if it is discovered. Otherwise, it is cleverness honoring Memnor.": "与其互相偷窃或争夺宝物，云巨人是不折不扣的赌徒，渴望高风险和高回报。他们经常在名义上不受他们控制的事件的结果上下注，例如较小的生物的生命。在对人形国家的军事胜利的赌注中，可以赢得或输掉军衔和国王的赎金。通过干涉冲突来固定赌注会导致赌注的损失，但这种欺骗只有在被发现时才被认为是作弊。否则，它就是尊重Memnor的聪明才智。",
	"The cockatrice looks like a hideous hybrid of lizard, bird, and bat, and it is infamous for its ability to turn flesh to stone. These omnivores have a diet that consists of berries, nuts, flowers, and small animals such as insects, mice, and frogs-things they can swallow whole. They would be no threat to anything else if not for their fierce and frenzied response to even a hint of danger. A cockatrice flies into the face of any threat, squawking and madly beating its wings as its head darts out to peck. The smallest scratch from a cockatrice's beak can spell doom as its victim slowly turns to stone from the injury.": "鸡冠花看起来像蜥蜴、鸟和蝙蝠的可怕混合体，它因能把肉体变成石头而臭名昭著。这些杂食动物的食物包括浆果、坚果、花和小动物，如昆虫、老鼠和青蛙--它们可以整个吞下。如果不是因为它们对哪怕是一丝危险的激烈和狂热的反应，它们不会对其他东西构成威胁。凤头鹦鹉面对任何威胁都会飞过来，一边叫一边疯狂地拍打着翅膀，脑袋飞快地往外啄。鸡冠花的喙最小的抓痕也会带来厄运，因为它的受害者会因为受伤而慢慢变成石头。",
	"Commoners include peasants, serfs, slaves, servants, pilgrims, merchants, artisans, and hermits.": "平民包括农民、农奴、奴隶、仆人、朝圣者、商人、工匠和隐士。",
	"Copper dragons are incorrigible pranksters, joke tellers, and riddlers that live in hills and rocky uplands. Despite their gregarious and even-tempered natures, they possess a covetous, miserly streak, and can become dangerous when their hoards are threatened.": "铜龙是无可救药的恶作剧者、讲笑话者和谜语者，生活在山丘和岩石高地。尽管他们生性好客，脾气平和，但他们拥有贪婪、吝啬的特质，当他们的囤积物受到威胁时，会变得很危险。",
	"A copper dragon has brow plates jutting over its eyes, extending back to long horns that grow as a series of overlapping segments. Its backswept cheek ridges and jaw frills give it a pensive look. At birth, a copper dragon's scales are a ruddy brown with a metallic tint. As the dragon ages, its scales become more coppery in color, later taking on a green tint as it ages. A copper dragon's pupils fade with age, and the eyes of the oldest copper dragons resemble glowing turquoise orbs.": "铜龙的眉板突出在眼睛上，向后延伸到长长的角，长成一系列重叠的部分。它的背脊和下巴的褶皱使它看起来很沉思。出生时，铜龙的鳞片是红褐色的，带有金属色泽。随着年龄的增长，它的鳞片会变得更加铜色，后来随着年龄的增长会呈现出绿色的色调。铜龙的瞳孔会随着年龄的增长而变淡，最古老的铜龙的眼睛就像发光的绿松石球体。",
	"A copper dragon appreciates wit, a good joke, humorous story, or riddle. A copper dragon becomes annoyed with any creature that doesn't laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor.": "铜龙欣赏智慧、好的笑话、幽默的故事或谜语。铜龙对任何不笑它的笑话或不幽默地接受它的把戏的生物感到厌烦。",
	"Copper dragons are particularly fond of bards. A dragon might carve out part of its lair as a temporary abode for a bard willing to regale it with stories, riddles, and music. To a copper dragon, such companionship is a treasure to be coveted.": "铜龙特别喜欢吟游诗人。一条龙可能会在它的巢穴中划出一部分，作为一个愿意用故事、谜语和音乐向它倾诉的吟游诗人的临时住所。对铜龙来说，这样的陪伴是一种令人垂涎的财富。",
	"When building its hoard, a copper dragon prefers treasures from the earth. Metals and precious stones are favorites of these creatures.": "在建立其囤积物时，铜龙更喜欢来自地球的宝物。金属和宝石是这些生物的最爱。",
	"A copper dragon is wary when it comes to showing off its possessions. If it knows that other creatures seek a specific item in its hoard, a copper dragon will not admit to possessing the item. Instead, it might send curious treasure hunters on a wild goose chase to search for the object while it watches from afar for its own pleasure.": "铜龙在炫耀自己的财产时很谨慎。如果它知道其他生物在寻找它囤积的特定物品，铜龙不会承认自己拥有该物品。相反，它可能会派好奇的寻宝者去寻找该物品，而它则在远处观望，以获得自己的乐趣。",
	"Copper dragons dwell in dry uplands and on hilltops, where they make their lairs in narrow caves. False walls in the lair hide secret antechambers where the dragon stores valuable ores, art objects, and other oddities it has collected over its lifetime. Worthless items are put on display in open caves to tantalize treasure seekers and distract them from where the real treasure is hidden.": "铜龙居住在干燥的高地和山顶上，它们在狭窄的洞穴中筑巢。巢穴中的假墙隐藏着秘密的候车室，龙在那里储存有价值的矿石、艺术品和它一生中收集的其他奇珍异宝。不值钱的东西被放在开放的洞穴中展示，以诱惑寻宝者，并分散他们对真正藏宝之处的注意力。",
	"Couatls are benevolent serpentine beings of great intellect and insight. Their brilliantly colored wings and gentle manner speak to their celestial origins.": "库拉特斯是仁慈的蛇形生物，具有伟大的智慧和洞察力。他们色彩艳丽的翅膀和温和的态度说明了他们的天体起源。",
	"Couatls were created as guardians and caretakers by a benevolent god not worshiped since the dawn of time, and which is forgotten now by all but the couatls themselves. Most of the divine mandates given to these beings are long since fulfilled or failed. However, a number of couatls still watch over ancient power, await fulfillment of prophecy, or safeguard the heirs of creatures they once guided and protected. Regardless of a couatl's task, it prefers to remain hidden, revealing itself only as a last resort.": "库拉特斯是由一个自古以来就不被崇拜的仁慈的神创造出来的，现在除了库拉特斯自己，所有人都忘记了这个神。大多数赋予这些生命的神圣任务早已完成或失败。然而，一些库拉图仍在守护着古老的力量，等待预言的实现，或者保护他们曾经引导和保护的生物的继承人。无论库拉特斯的任务是什么，它都喜欢保持隐蔽，只有在最后关头才会暴露自己。",
	"A couatl can't lie, but it can withhold information, answer questions vaguely, or allow others to jump to the wrong conclusions if doing so is necessary to protect something, to keep promises, or to hide the secret of its existence.": "库阿特尔不会撒谎，但它可以隐瞒信息，含糊其辞地回答问题，或允许他人得出错误的结论，如果这样做是为了保护某些东西，履行承诺，或隐藏其存在的秘密。",
	"A couatl can live for ages without sustenance, even surviving without air, but these creatures can die of disease or the passage of time. A couatl can sense its end up to a century beforehand, but it has no insight into the manner of its demise. If a couatl has already accomplished what it set out to do, it accepts its fate. However, if its imminent death endangers the completion of its goals, it actively seeks out another couatl with which to produce offspring.": "库阿特尔可以在没有营养的情况下活很久，甚至可以在没有空气的情况下生存，但这些生物可以死于疾病或时间的流逝。库拉图可以提前一个世纪感觉到自己的死亡，但它对自己的死亡方式没有任何洞察力。如果库阿特尔已经完成了它要做的事情，它就会接受自己的命运。然而，如果它的死亡即将威胁到它的目标的完成，它就会积极寻找另一个库阿特尔，并与之产生后代。",
	"The mating ritual of couatls is a beautiful and elaborate dance of magic and light, which results in a gem-like egg from which a new couatl hatches. The parent that sought out the mate raises the newborn couatl and instructs it as to its duties, so that it can complete whatever task the parent leaves unfinished.": "库拉特斯的交配仪式是一种美丽而精致的魔法和光的舞蹈，其结果是产生一个宝石般的蛋，从中孵化出一个新的库拉特斯。寻找配偶的父母将新生的库阿特尔养大，并指导它的职责，以便它能完成父母未完成的任何任务。",
	"Crawling claws are the severed hands of murderers animated by dark magic so that they can go on killing. Wizards and warlocks of a dark bent use crawling claws as extra hands in their labors.": "爬行爪是被黑暗魔法激活的杀人犯的断手，以便他们能够继续杀人。具有黑暗倾向的巫师和术士使用爬行爪作为他们工作中的额外双手。",
	"Through dark necromantic rituals, the life force of a murderer is bound to its severed hand, haunting and animating it. If a dead murderer's spirit already manifests as another undead creature, if the murderer is raised from death, or if the spirit has long passed on to another plane, the ritual fails.": "通过黑暗的亡灵仪式，凶手的生命力被束缚在其被切断的手上，萦绕着它并使之充满活力。如果一个死去的凶手的灵魂已经表现为另一个不死生物，如果凶手从死亡中复活，或者如果灵魂早已去了另一个世界，仪式就会失败。",
	"The ritual invoked to create a crawling claw works best with a hand recently severed from a murderer. To this end, ritualists and their servants frequent public executions to gain possession of suitable hands, or make bargains with assassins and torturers.": "用来创造爬行爪的仪式，最好是用最近从杀人犯身上割下来的手。为此，祭祀者和他们的仆人经常参加公开处决，以获得合适的手，或者与刺客和施暴者进行交易。",
	"A crawling claw can't be turned, nor can it be controlled by spells that control undead. These foul monsters are entirely bound to the will of their creator, which can concentrate on a claw in sight to mentally command its every action. If the crawling claw's creator doesn't command it, the claw follows its last command to the best of its ability.": "爬行的爪子不能被转动，也不能被控制亡灵的法术所控制。这些肮脏的怪物完全受制于它们的创造者的意志，创造者可以集中精力在视线范围内的爪子上，用精神指挥它的每一个动作。如果爬行爪的创造者没有命令它，这个爪子就会尽其所能地遵循它最后的命令。",
	"Commands given to a crawling claw must be simple. A claw can't be tasked with finding and killing a particular person, because its limited senses and intelligence prevent it from tracking and picking out specific individuals. However, a command to kill all creatures in a particular locale works. A crawling claw can easily feel out the contours of keys and doorknobs, crawling from room to room on a blind killing spree.": "给予爬行爪的命令必须是简单的。爪子不能被赋予寻找和杀死一个特定的人的任务，因为它有限的感官和智力使它无法追踪和挑选出特定的人。然而，一个杀死某个特定地点的所有生物的命令是可行的。爬行的爪子可以轻易地摸出钥匙和门把手的轮廓，从一个房间爬到另一个房间，进行盲目的杀戮。",
	"A crawling claw possesses little of the intellect and memories of the individual of which it was once a living part. The hate, jealousy, or greed that drove that person to murder lingers on, however, amplified by the claw's torturous fragmented state. Left to its own devices, a crawling claw imitates and recreates the same murderous acts it committed in life.": "爬行的爪子几乎没有智力和记忆，而它曾经是这个人的一个活的部分。然而，驱使那个人杀人的仇恨、嫉妒或贪婪仍然存在，并被爪子的折磨人的分裂状态所放大。如果任其发展，爬行的爪子会模仿并重现其生前的谋杀行为。",
	"If a crawling claw is animated from the severed hand of a still-living murderer, the ritual binds the claw to the murderer's soul. The disembodied hand can then return to its former limb, its undead flesh knitting to the living arm from which it was severed.": "如果一只爬行的爪子从一个仍然活着的杀人犯的断手中活过来，这个仪式会将爪子与杀人犯的灵魂结合起来。然后，这只没有实体的手可以回到它以前的肢体上，它的不死之肉与它被切断的活体手臂交织在一起。",
	"Made whole again, the murderer acts as though the hand had never been severed and the ritual had never taken place. When the crawling claw separates again, the living body falls into a coma. Destroying the crawling claw while it is away from the body kills the murderer. However, killing the murderer has no effect on the crawling claw.": "凶手重新变得完整，就像手从未被切断，仪式从未发生过一样。当爬行的爪子再次分离时，活着的身体就会陷入昏迷。当爬行的爪子离开身体时，摧毁它可以杀死凶手。然而，杀死凶手对爬行的爪子没有影响。",
	"A crawling claw doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "爬行的爪子不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Fanatics are often part of a cult's leadership, using their charisma and dogma to influence and prey on those of weak will. Most are interested in personal power above all else": "狂热分子往往是邪教领导层的一部分，利用他们的魅力和教条来影响和掠夺那些意志薄弱的人。大多数人对个人权力的兴趣高于其他一切",
	"Cultists swear allegiance to dark powers such as elemental princes, demon lords, or archdevils. Most conceal their loyalties to avoid being ostracized, imprisoned, or executed for their beliefs. Unlike evil acolytes, cultists often show signs of insanity in their beliefs and practices.": "崇拜者发誓效忠于黑暗力量，如元素王子、恶魔领主或大恶魔。大多数人隐瞒自己的忠诚，以避免因其信仰而被排斥、监禁或处决。与邪恶的信徒不同，邪教分子在他们的信仰和实践中经常表现出精神错乱的迹象。",

	"Legends claim that the cyclopes are the spawn of one of the gods of the giants, but these creatures pay little heed to any deities. They see little benefit in prayer and dislike ritual, which they perceive as complex and foreign. However, a cyclops that gains direct benefit from some site of divine power, or which is threatened by a supernatural force or creature, will pay homage as long as the benefit or threat remains.": "传说中，独眼巨人是巨人之神的后代，但这些生物对任何神灵都不感兴趣。他们认为祈祷没有什么好处，也不喜欢仪式，因为他们认为仪式是复杂而陌生的。然而，如果剑水蚤从某种神力中获得直接利益，或者受到超自然力量或生物的威胁，只要这种利益或威胁还在，它们就会向其致敬。",
	"Though they are reasonably intelligent, cyclopes live simple, reclusive lives, keeping herds of animals for food. They prefer to dwell alone or in small family groups, lairing in caves, ruins, or rough structures of dry stone construction they build themselves. A cyclops keeps its herd animals with it at night, sealing the entrance to its home with boulders to let it serve double duty as a barn.": "虽然它们相当聪明，但独眼巨人的生活简单而隐蔽，饲养动物作为食物。它们喜欢单独居住或以小家庭为单位，居住在洞穴、废墟或自己建造的干石结构的粗糙建筑中。剑水蚤在夜间将其畜群带在身边，用巨石封住其住所的入口，让它兼做谷仓。",
	"A cyclops lairs within a day's journey of other cyclopes, so that they can meet to trade goods or seek mates. They craft weapons and tools of wood and stone, but will use metal when they can find it. Although cyclopes understand the Giant tongue, they write nothing and speak little, using grunts and gestures for their interactions with each other. Cyclopes don't use money for trade, but they value gold, shells, and other glittering and colorful objects as jewelry. A cyclops might wear a necklace strung with feathers and silver coins, but also with pewter goblets, cutlery, and other bits of ruined metal.": "剑水蚤的巢穴离其他剑水蚤有一天的路程，这样它们就可以见面交易货物或寻找配偶。他们用木头和石头制作武器和工具，但当他们能找到金属时也会使用。虽然独眼巨人能听懂巨人的语言，但他们不会写字，也很少说话，而是用咕哝声和手势进行交流。独眼巨人不使用货币进行交易，但他们重视黄金、贝壳和其他闪闪发光、色彩斑斓的物体作为珠宝。独眼巨人可能会佩戴一条串有羽毛和银币的项链，也可能佩戴锡制高脚杯、餐具和其他废旧金属的碎片。",
	"Cyclopes aren't great thinkers or strategists. Slow to learn and bound to their traditional ways, they find innovation difficult. Although they are a terrifying threat in combat due to their size and strength, they can often be tricked by clever foes. Cyclopes can be cowed and awed by obvious displays of magic. Rustics with little exposure to magic, they can be deceived into mistaking a warlock, cleric, or other caster for a powerful divine figure. However, their sense of pride causes them to react with vengeful, bloodthirsty violence once they learn that the individual they assumed was a \"god\" is a mere mortal.": "独眼巨人并不是伟大的思想家或战略家。他们学习缓慢，受传统方式的束缚，发现创新很困难。尽管由于他们的体型和力量，他们在战斗中是一个可怕的威胁，但他们经常被聪明的敌人所欺骗。独眼巨人可以被明显的魔法展示所吓倒和震慑。由于很少接触到魔法，他们会被欺骗，误以为术士、牧师或其他施法者是强大的神灵人物。然而，一旦他们知道他们认为的 \"神 \"只是一个凡人，他们的自豪感就会使他们做出报复性的、嗜血的暴力反应。",
	"Dao are greedy, malicious genies from the Elemental Plane of Earth. They adorn themselves with jewelry crafted from precious gems and rare metals, and when they fly, their lower bodies become columns of swirling sand. A dao isn't happy unless it is the envy of other dao.": "道是来自地球元素界的贪婪、恶意的精灵。他们用珍贵的宝石和稀有金属制成的珠宝来装饰自己，当他们飞行时，他们的下半身会变成旋转的沙柱。除非得到其他道的羡慕，否则道是不会快乐的。",
	"The dao dwell in complexes of twisting tunnels and glittering ore-veined caverns on the Elemental Plane of Earth.

	"A dao never assists a mortal unless the genie has something to gain, preferably treasure.

	"The dao trade for the finest slaves that money can buy, forcing them to work in dangerous subterranean realms that rumble with earthquakes. As much as they enjoy enslaving others, the dao hate being enslaved.

Unfortunately for the dao, their greed makes it relatively easy for mages to cozen them into service.": "道教以金钱买到的最好的奴隶为交易对象，强迫他们在危险的地下世界工作，这些地方地震不断。尽管他们喜欢奴役他人，但道人却讨厌被奴役。强大的巫师们已经知道将道引诱到物质世界，并将他们困在魔法宝石或铁瓶的范围内。对道来说，不幸的是，他们的贪婪使法师们更容易让他们为之服务。",

	"Genies are as brilliant as they are mighty, as proud as they are majestic. Haughty and decadent, they have a profound sense of entitlement that stems from the knowledge that few creatures except the gods and other genies can challenge their power.": "精灵们既聪明又强大，既骄傲又雄伟。他们傲慢而颓废，有一种深刻的权利感，这源于他们知道除了众神和其他精灵外，很少有生物能挑战他们的权力。",
	" A genie is born when the soul of a sentient living creature melds with the primordial matter of an elemental plane. Only under rare circumstances does such an elemental-infused soul coalesce into a manifest form and create a genie.": " 当有生命的生物的灵魂与元素界的原始物质融为一体时，就会诞生一个精灵。只有在罕见的情况下，这样一个被元素注入的灵魂才会凝聚成一个明显的形式，并创造出一个精灵。",
	"A genie usually retains no connection to the soul that gave it form. That life force is a building block that determines the genie's form and apparent gender, as well as one or two key personality traits. Although they resemble humanoid beings, genies are elemental spirits given physical form. They don't mate with other genies or produce genie offspring, as all new genies are born out of the same mysterious fusion of spirit energy and elemental power. A genie with a stronger connection to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child with a mortal, although such offspring are rare.": "精灵通常与赋予其形态的灵魂没有任何联系。这种生命力是决定精灵形态和明显性别以及一两个关键人格特征的基石。虽然它们与人形生物相似，但精灵是被赋予物理形态的元素精神。他们不与其他精灵交配，也不产生精灵的后代，因为所有新的精灵都是从同样神秘的精神能量和元素力量的融合中诞生。一个与凡人灵魂有更强联系的精灵可能会选择与凡人生下孩子，尽管这样的后代很罕见。",
	"When a genie perishes, it leaves nothing behind except what it was wearing or carrying, along with a small trace of its native element: a pile of dust, a gust of wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of water and foam.": "当一个精灵灭亡时，除了它所穿戴或携带的东西，以及它的原生元素的一点痕迹外，它什么也没留下：一堆灰尘、一阵风、火和烟的闪光，或水和泡沫的爆发。",
	"In contrast to their love of slaves, most genies loathe being bound to service themselves. A genie obeys the will of another only when bribed or compelled by magic. All genies command the power of their native element, but a rare few also possess the power to grant wishes. For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek to bind genies into service.": "与他们对奴隶的喜爱相反，大多数精灵厌恶被束缚为自己服务。精灵只有在被贿赂或被魔法强迫的情况下才会服从他人的意愿。所有的精灵都掌握着他们本族元素的力量，但也有极少数精灵拥有实现愿望的力量。出于这两个原因，凡人法师经常寻求约束精灵为其服务。",
	"Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and envy of other genies, asserting their superiority at every opportunity. Other genies respect the influence of the noble genies, knowing how unwise it is to defy a creature that can alter reality at a whim.

	"Their miraculous powers, the grandeur of their abodes, and the numbers of their slaves allow some genies to deceive themselves into believing they are as powerful as the gods. Some go so far as to demand that mortals of other realms-even whole continents or worlds-bow down before them.": "他们神奇的力量、宏伟的住所以及奴隶的数量让一些精灵自欺欺人地认为他们和神一样强大。有些人甚至要求其他领域的凡人--甚至整个大陆或世界--在他们面前俯首称臣。",
	" Mortal slaves serve to validate a genie's power and high self-opinion. A hundred flattering voices are music to a genie's ears, while two hundred mortal slaves prostrated at its feet are proof that it is lord and master. Genies view slaves as living property, and a genie without property amounts to nothing among its own kind. As a result, many genies treasure their slaves, treating them as honored members of their households. Evil genies freely threaten and abuse their slaves, but never to the extent that the slaves are no longer of use.": " 凡人奴隶的作用是验证精灵的力量和高尚的自我评价。一百个奉承的声音对精灵来说是一种音乐，而两百个匍匐在它脚下的凡人奴隶则证明它是主宰和主人。精灵将奴隶视为活的财产，而没有财产的精灵在其同类中一无是处。因此，许多精灵珍视他们的奴隶，把他们当作家庭的尊贵成员。邪恶的精灵会自由地威胁和虐待他们的奴隶，但绝不会达到奴隶不再有用的程度。",
	" Noble genies are the rarest of their kind. They are used to getting what they want, and have learned to trade their ability to grant wishes to attain the objects of their desire.

	"A darkmantle clings to cavern ceilings, remaining perfectly still as it waits for creatures to pass beneath it. From a distance, it can pass itself off as a stalactite or a lump of stone. Then it drops from the ceiling and unfurls, surrounding itself with magical darkness as it engulfs and crushes its prey.": "一只黑暗螳螂依附在洞穴的天花板上，保持完全静止，等待着生物从它下面经过。从远处看，它可以把自己当作钟乳石或一坨石头。然后它从天花板上落下并展开，用神奇的黑暗包围自己，吞噬并压碎它的猎物。",
	"Darkmantles are found throughout the Underdark, but they are equally common on the Shadowfell. Thriving in that dark realm, they fill an ecological niche similar to bats on the Material Plane. Intelligent creatures of the Shadowfell sometimes train darkmantles as guardians or companions.": "黑暗螳螂在整个暗黑世界都能找到，但它们在阴影地带也同样常见。它们在那个黑暗的领域中茁壮成长，填补了一个类似于物质世界中蝙蝠的生态位。暗影城的智慧生物有时会训练暗黑金刚作为守护者或同伴。",

	"By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon's deeds or accomplishments.

Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.": "通过耗费大量的魔法力量，恶魔领主可以将较小的恶魔提升到更大的形态，尽管这种提升从来不是源于恶魔的行为或成就。相反，当恶魔领主需要一个隐形的间谍时，他可能会把一只鬃毛扭曲成quasit，或者在对抗对手的领主时，把一支dretches军队变成hezrous。恶魔领主很少将恶魔提升到最高级别，因为他们害怕在无意中为自己的权力制造对手。",

	"Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can't stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells.

If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.": "那些愿意冒险召唤恶魔的人可能是为了从它身上获取信息，迫使它为自己服务，或者派它去完成只有绝对邪恶的生物才能完成的任务。准备工作是关键，有经验的召唤师知道特定的咒语和魔法物品可以迫使恶魔屈服于他人的意志。如果犯了一个错误，挣脱束缚的恶魔就会毫不留情地让其召唤者成为其愤怒的第一个受害者。",
	"The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Iggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters.

Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.": "捆绑恶魔的物品必须用不神圣的咒语和无辜的血液进行特别准备。它散发出一种可触及的邪恶，使周围的空气变得寒冷和污浊。处理这种物体的生物会经历令人不安的梦境和邪恶的冲动，但能够控制恶魔，因为恶魔的本质被困在该物体中。摧毁该物品可以释放恶魔，而恶魔会立即对其捆绑者进行报复。",
	"No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.": "不管它的束缚有多牢固，强大的恶魔往往能找到办法逃离关押它的物体。当恶魔的精华从它的容器中出现时，它可以附身于凡人的宿主。有时，恶魔采用隐蔽的方式来隐藏成功的附身。其他时候，它通过新的形式释放出其恶魔的全部动力。",
	"As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.": "只要恶魔仍然占有它的宿主，如果它被从肉体中驱除，或者宿主死亡，宿主的灵魂就有可能与恶魔一起被拖入深渊。如果恶魔附身在一个生物身上，而束缚恶魔的物体被摧毁，那么附身就会持续下去，直到使用强大的魔法将恶魔的灵魂从其宿主身上赶出去。",

	"Although most demon lords rise up from the vast and uncountable mobs of demons rampaging across the Abyss, the plane also rewards outsiders that conquer any of its infinite layers. The elven goddess Lolth became a demon lord after Corellon Larethian cast her into the Abyss for betraying elvenkind. Sages claim that the Dark Prince Graz'zt originated on some other plane before stealing his abyssal title from another long-forgotten demon lord.": "尽管大多数恶魔领主都是从横行于深渊的庞大而难以计数的恶魔群中崛起的，但这个平面也会奖励那些征服了其无限层的外来者。精灵女神洛尔思因背叛精灵族而被科里隆-拉雷西安扔进深渊，之后她成为了恶魔领主。圣人声称黑暗王子格拉兹兹特在从另一个早已被遗忘的恶魔领主那里偷取他的深渊头衔之前，起源于某个其他平面。",
	"The greatest sign of a demon lord's power is its ability to reshape an abyssal realm. A layer of the Abyss controlled by a demon lord becomes a twisted reflection of that fiend's vile personality, and demon lords seldom leave their realms for fear of allowing another creature to reshape and seize it.": "恶魔领主力量的最大标志是其重塑深渊领域的能力。被恶魔领主控制的深渊层成为该恶魔卑劣个性的扭曲反映，恶魔领主很少离开他们的领域，因为害怕让其他生物重塑并夺取它。",
	"As with other demons, a demon lord that dies on another plane has its essence return to the Abyss, where it reforms into a new body.

He carries a huge glaive named Heartcleaver, but often hurls it into the fray so as to face his enemies with horns and hooves.": "野兽王子出现时是一个巨大的、长着黑毛的牛头人，长着铁角、红色的眼睛和一张浸满鲜血的嘴。他的铁冠上顶着敌人腐烂的头颅，而他的黑暗盔甲上镶嵌着尖刺和骷髅般的锯齿。他带着一把名为Heartcleaver的巨大玻璃刀，但经常把它扔到战场上，以便用角和蹄子面对他的敌人。",
	"The Sibilant Beast and the self-styled Prince of Demons, Demogorgon yearns for nothing less than undoing the order of the multiverse. An insane assemblage of features and drives, the Prince of Demons inspires fear and hatred among other demons and demon lords.": "咝咝声的野兽和自称的恶魔王子，德摩根渴望的是破坏多元宇宙的秩序，而不是别的。作为一种疯狂的特征和驱动力的集合体，恶魔王子激发了其他恶魔和恶魔领主的恐惧和仇恨。",
	"Demogorgon towers three times the height of a human, his body as sinuous as a snake's and as powerful as a great ape's. Suckered tentacles take the place of his arms. His saurian lower torso ends in webbed and clawed feet, and a forked tail whose whip-like tips are armed with cruel blades. The Prince of Demons has two baleful baboon heads, both of them mad. It is only the conflict between the two halves of his dual nature that keeps the demon lord's ambitions in check.": "德摩根的身高是人类的三倍，他的身体像蛇一样蜿蜒，像巨猿一样有力。被吸住的触手代替了他的手臂。他的萨乌尔式的下半身末端是有蹼和爪子的脚，还有一条分叉的尾巴，其鞭子般的尖端装有残忍的刀片。恶魔王子有两个可恶的狒狒头，它们都很疯狂。只有他的双重性质的两半之间的冲突才能使恶魔领主的野心得到控制。",
	"The demon lord Graz'zt appears as a darkly handsome figure nearly nine feet tall. Those who refer to the Dark Prince as the most humanoid of the demon lords vastly underestimate the capacity for evil in his scheming heart.": "恶魔领主Graz'zt出现时是一个黑暗的英俊形象，身高近九英尺。那些把黑暗王子称为恶魔领主中最像人类的人，大大低估了他阴险的内心的邪恶能力。",
	"Graz'zt is a striking physical specimen, whose demonic nature shows in his ebon skin, pointed ears, yellow fangs, crown of horns, and six-fingered hands. He delights in finery, pageantry, and sating his decadent desires with subjects and consorts alike, among whom incubi and succubi are often his favorites.": "格拉兹兹特是一个引人注目的身体标本，他的恶魔本性表现在他的乌黑皮肤、尖耳朵、黄色獠牙、角冠和六指的手。他喜欢华丽的服饰、盛装打扮，并与臣民和妃子们一起满足他的颓废欲望，其中的女妖和魅魔往往是他的最爱。",
	"The demon lord of slimes and oozes, Juiblex is a stew of noxious fluids that lurks in the abyssal depths. The wretched Faceless Lord cares nothing for cultists or mortal servants, and its sole desire is to turn all creatures into formless copies of its horrid self.": "作为粘液和渗出物的恶魔领主，朱布莱克斯是潜伏在深渊中的有毒液体的混合物。这个可恶的无面之王对崇拜者或凡人的仆人毫不在意，它唯一的愿望是把所有的生物都变成它可怕的自我的无形拷贝。",
	"In its resting state, Juiblex spreads out in a noxious mass, bubbling and filling the air with a profound stench. On the rare occasions when creatures confront the demon lord, Juiblex draws itself up into a shuddering cone of slime striated with veins of black and green. Baleful red eyes swim within its gelatinous body, while dripping pseudopods of ooze lash out hungrily at any creature they can reach.": "在静止状态下，Juiblex以一种有害的方式扩散开来，冒着气泡，在空气中弥漫着深刻的臭味。在极少数情况下，当生物与恶魔领主对抗时，Juiblex会把自己拉成一个颤抖的锥形粘液，上面有黑色和绿色的纹路。可怕的红色眼睛在它的胶状身体里游动，而滴落的假肢则饥渴地扑向任何它们能触及的生物。",
	"The Demon Queen of Spiders is the evil matron of the drow. Her every thought is touched by malice, and the depth of her viciousness can surprise even her most faithful priestesses. She directs her faithful while she weaves plots across the worlds of the Material Plane, looking forward to the time when her drow followers bring those worlds under her control.": "蜘蛛魔后是鸦人的邪恶女皇。她的每一个想法都被恶意所触动，她的恶毒程度甚至能让她最忠实的女祭司们感到惊讶。她一边指挥着她的信徒，一边在物质界的各个世界编织阴谋，期待着她的乌鸦信徒将这些世界置于她的控制之下。",
	"Lolth appears as a lithe, imperious drow matriarch when she manifests to her followers in the mortal realm, which she does with unusual frequency. When battle breaks out-or if she has a reason to remind her followers to fear her—Lolth's lower body transforms into that of a huge demonic spider, whose spike—tipped legs and mandibles tear foes apart.": "当Lolth在凡间向她的追随者显现时，她会以一个轻盈的、傲慢的乌鸦族族长的形象出现，她这样做的频率不一般。当战斗爆发时，或者如果她有理由提醒她的追随者害怕她的话，洛尔思的下半身就会变成一只巨大的恶魔蜘蛛，其带刺的腿和下颚会将敌人撕碎。",
	"Known as the Demon Prince of Undeath and the Blood Lord, the demon lord Orcus is worshiped by the undead and by living creatures that channel the power of undeath.

	"The Demon Prince of Undeath is a foul and corpulent creature, with a humanoid torso, powerful goat legs, and the desiccated head of a ram. His sore-ridden body stinks of disease, but his decaying head and glowing red eyes are as a creature already dead. Great black bat wings sprout from his back, stirring reeking air as he moves.": "不死的恶魔王子是一个肮脏而腐烂的生物，有一个人形的躯干，有力的山羊腿，和一个干瘪的公羊头。他疮痍满目的身体散发着疾病的恶臭，但他腐烂的头颅和发红的眼睛就像一个已经死去的生物。巨大的黑色蝙蝠翅膀从他的背上长出，随着他的移动搅动着发臭的空气。",

	"Known as the Gnoll Lord and the Beast of Butchery, the demon lord Yeenoghu hungers for slaughter and senseless destruction.

	"No one knows the full number of demon lords that rage in the Abyss. Given the infinite depths of that plane, powerful demons constantly rise to become demon lords, then fall almost as quickly.

	"An angel slays evil creatures without remorse. As the embodiment of law and good, an angel is almost never mistaken in its judgments. This quality can create a sense of superiority in an angel, a sense that comes to the fore when an angel's task conflicts with the goals of another creature. The angel never acquiesces or gives way. When an angel is sent to aid mortals, it is sent not to serve but to command. The gods of good therefore send their angels among mortals only in response to the most dire circumstances.": "天使杀戮邪恶的生物而无怨无悔。作为法律和善的化身，天使的判断几乎从不出错。这种品质会在天使身上产生一种优越感，当天使的任务与其他生物的目标发生冲突时，这种感觉就会凸显出来。天使从不默许或让步。当一个天使被派来帮助凡人时，它不是被派来服务，而是被派来指挥。因此，善神只在最可怕的情况下才派他们的天使到凡人中间。",
	"An angel's moral compass grants it a sense of infallibility that can sometimes spell its undoing. Angels are usually too wise to fall for a simple deception, but sometimes pride can lead one to commit an evil act. Whether intentional or accidental, such an act is a permanent stain that marks the angel as an outcast. Fallen angels retain their power but lose their connection to the deities from which they were made. Most fallen angels take their banishment personally, rebelling against the powers they served by seeking rulership over a section of the Abyss or a place among other fallen in the hierarchy of the Nine Hells. Zariel, the ruler of the first layer of the Nine Hells, is such a creature. Rather than rebel, some fallen angels resign themselves to an isolated existence on the Material Plane, living in disguise as simple hermits. If they are redeemed, they can become powerful allies dedicated to justice and compassionate service.": "天使的道德指南针赋予它一种无懈可击的感觉，而这种感觉有时会使它走向灭亡。天使通常很聪明，不会被简单的欺骗所迷惑，但有时骄傲会使人做出邪恶的行为。无论有意还是无意，这样的行为都是一个永久的污点，标志着天使是一个被抛弃的人。堕落的天使保留了他们的力量，但失去了与他们被制造出来的神祗的联系。大多数堕落的天使对他们的放逐耿耿于怀，通过寻求对深渊某部分的统治权或在九层地狱的其他堕落者中占有一席之地来反抗他们所服务的权力。九层地狱第一层的统治者扎里尔就是这样一个生物。一些堕落的天使并没有反叛，而是在物质世界中屈服于孤立的存在，伪装成简单的隐士生活。如果他们被救赎，他们可以成为强大的盟友，致力于正义和慈悲的服务。",

Its hair and eyes gleam with an unearthly luster, and large feathery wings unfurl from its shoulder blades.": "传说中，天使常年以凡人的形态出现，向心地善良的人们提供帮助、希望和勇气。魔法师可以变成任何形状，尽管它更喜欢以无害的人形或动物形出现在凡人面前。当情况需要它卸下伪装时，魔王是一个美丽的人形生物，拥有银色的皮肤。它的头发和眼睛闪烁着不食人间烟火的光泽，巨大的羽毛状翅膀从肩胛骨上展开。",
	"Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baator extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Nessus, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power.

	"Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.": "魔鬼以征服、奴役和压迫为生。他们以对弱者行使权力为乐，任何违抗魔鬼权威的生物都会面临迅速而残酷的惩罚。每一次互动都是魔鬼展示其权力的机会，所有的魔鬼都对如何使用和滥用其权力有着敏锐的认识。",
	"Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.": "魔鬼了解困扰聪明的凡人的缺点，他们利用这些知识把凡人引向诱惑和黑暗，把生物变成他们自己腐败的奴隶。物质世界的魔鬼利用他们的影响力来操纵人形统治者，低声说着邪恶的想法，煽动偏执，并最终促使他们采取暴虐的行动。",
	"In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.": "根据他们合法的结盟，魔鬼们即使在嫉妒或不喜欢他们的上司时也会服从，因为他们知道他们的服从会得到回报。九层地狱的等级制度依赖于这种坚定不移的忠诚，如果没有这种忠诚，这个恶魔的世界将变得像深渊一样无政府。",
	"At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.": "同时，魔鬼的天性是谋划，在一些人身上产生了统治的欲望，使他们对被统治的满足感黯然失色。这种独特的野心在阿斯莫德任命的统治九层地狱的大魔鬼中最为强烈。这些高级恶魔是唯一能品尝到真正权力的恶魔，他们对权力的渴望就像最甜美的安眠药。",
	"Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus's will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.": "魔鬼被限制在下层世界，但他们可以通过传送门或强大的召唤魔法来超越这些世界。他们喜欢与凡人讨价还价，以获得一些利益或奖品，但凡人在进行这种讨价还价时必须保持警惕。魔鬼是狡猾的谈判者，在执行协议的条款方面非常无情。此外，即使是与最低级的魔鬼签订的合同，也会被阿斯莫德的意志所强制执行。任何破坏这种契约的凡人生物都会立即丧失其灵魂，并被送入九层地狱。",
	"To own a creature's soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal's soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.": "拥有一个生物的灵魂就是对该生物的绝对控制，大多数魔鬼不接受其他货币来换取他们所能提供的恶魔般的力量和恩惠。灵魂通常在凡人自然死亡时被没收，因为魔鬼是不死之身，可以等待多年后合同的履行。如果契约允许魔鬼在死前索要凡人的灵魂，它可以立即带着灵魂返回九层地狱。只有神的干预才能在恶魔索取灵魂后释放它。",
	"The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.": "九层地狱有一个严格的等级制度，规定了其社会的各个方面。阿斯莫德是所有魔鬼的最高统治者，也是九幽地狱中唯一拥有低等神力的生物。在物质世界中，阿斯莫德被作为崇拜对象，他激励着以他的名字命名的邪恶人形邪教。在九层地狱中，他指挥着几十个坑道恶魔将军，而这些将军又指挥着下属的军团。",
	"A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser archdevils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baator from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.": "阿斯莫德是一个至高无上的暴君，一个聪明的欺骗者，一个狡猾的大师，他通过让他的朋友接近，让他的敌人接近来保护他的王位。他将大部分统治事务委托给构成九层地狱官僚机构的坑道恶魔和较小的大恶魔，即使他知道这些强大的恶魔阴谋篡夺他所统治的巴托王座。阿斯莫德任命大恶魔，他可以随心所欲地剥夺地狱等级制度中任何成员的等级和地位。",

	"When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil's memories passing intact from one form to the next.": "当一个邪恶的凡人的灵魂沉入九层地狱时，它就会变成一个可恶的雷姆的物理形态。大魔王和大魔王有能力将雷姆晋升为小魔王。大恶魔可以将小恶魔提升为大恶魔，而阿斯莫德单独可以将大恶魔提升为大恶魔。这种邪恶的晋升会带来短暂而痛苦的转变，魔鬼的记忆会从一种形态完整地传递到另一种形态。",
	"Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.": "低级别的晋升通常是基于需要，例如，当一个坑道魔王将雷姆雷特转化为小恶魔以获得其麾下的隐形间谍。高级别的晋升几乎总是基于功绩，例如当一个在战斗中表现突出的骨魔被它所服务的大魔王转化为角魔时。在地狱形态的等级制度中，一个魔鬼的晋升很少超过一个级别。",
	"Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.": "降级是魔鬼们对失败或不服从的习惯性惩罚。大魔王或大魔王可以将小魔王降为雷姆，而小魔王则失去了对其先前存在的所有记忆。大魔王可以将一个大魔王降为小魔王，但被降级的魔王会保留其记忆--如果降级的严重程度过高，可能会寻求报复。",

Doppelgangers often follow or capture creatures they intend to impersonate, studying them and probing their minds for secrets. A doppelganger can read a creature's surface thoughts, allowing it to glean that creature's name, desires, and fears, along with a few scattered memories.

Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient.

Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.": "鸦人用金刚砂制作武器，这是一种黑暗和超自然的硬金属。乌鸦工匠们用网状的花纹和蜘蛛图案来装饰他们的武器和盔甲，法师们有时会给物品注入魔法以增强它们的效力。然而，这种魔力在暴露于阳光下时就会消失，所以魔法鸦人的武器和盔甲在被带到地面时很少能保留它们的强化效果和魔法属性。",
	"Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.": "鸦人的政治是残酷的，充满了阴谋。当鸦人合作时，通常是为了消灭一个共同的敌人并确保他们自己的生存，这样的联盟是短暂的，充满危险的。",
	"Drow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house's social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.": "鸦人社会分为多个贵族家族，每个家族都由一位女主人统治，她试图提高自己家族的声望和权力，使其凌驾于所有其他家族之上。家族中的其他高级成员都有血缘关系，而中层则是来自弱小家族、发誓效忠于大家族的鸦人。在一个家族的社会阶梯的最底层岌岌可危的是家族奴隶，由出身低微的乌鸦和偶尔的非乌鸦俘虏组成。",
	"Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.": "洛尔思，通过她忠实的女祭司，支配着乌鸦社会的规则，确保她的命令和阴谋得到执行。由于洛尔思很容易在物质世界显现，并直接惩罚那些不服从她的人，所以乌鸦已经学会听从她的话，并按照她的女祭司的命令行事。",
	"In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a house.": "在乌鸦社会中，男性对女性是顺从的。一个男性乌鸦可能会带领地下城的巡逻队或突击队到地面，但他要向女性乌鸦报告--要么是他家族的女主人，要么是她亲自挑选的女性下属之一。尽管男性乌鸦可以担任乌鸦社会中的几乎任何职务，但他们不能成为祭司，也不能统治一个家族。",

	"Such priestesses execute the will of the Spider Queen, and as a result, they wield tremendous power and influence in drow society. The matron mothers who rule the drow houses are the most powerful of Lolth's priestesses, but they must constantly balance their devotion to the Spider Queen with their devotion to their families.": "这些女祭司执行蜘蛛女王的意志，因此，她们在乌鸦社会中拥有巨大的权力和影响力。统治乌鸦家族的母亲是洛尔思最强大的女祭司，但她们必须不断平衡对蜘蛛女王的奉献和对家庭的奉献。",

Some are tribal shamans who heal the sick, pray to animal spirits, and provide spiritual guidance.": "德鲁伊居住在森林和其他僻静的荒野中，他们在那里保护自然界不受怪物和文明的侵袭。有些是部落的巫师，他们为病人治病，向动物的灵魂祈祷，并提供精神指导。",

	"Powerful fey will sometimes bind lesser fey spirits to trees, transforming them into dryads. This is sometimes done as a punishment when the fey spirit falls in love with a mortal and that love is forbidden.": "强大的费伊人有时会把较小的费伊人的灵魂绑在树上，把他们变成干尸。这有时是作为一种惩罚，当精灵爱上一个凡人而这种爱是被禁止的。",
	"A dryad can emerge from the tree and travel the lands around it, but the tree remains her home and roots her to the world.

	"Dryads can speak with plants and animals. They can teleport from one tree to another, luring interlopers away from their groves. If pressed, a dryad can beguile humanoids with her enchantments, turning enemies into friends. They also know a handful of useful spells.": "Dryads可以与植物和动物对话。他们可以从一棵树传送到另一棵树，把入侵者从他们的丛林中引开。如果被逼急了，干尸可以用她的魔法诱导人类，化敌为友。他们还知道一些有用的法术。",

	"The duergar were once dwarves, before their greed and endless delving beneath the earth brought them into contact with the mind flayers. Held in captivity for generations by the illithids, the dwarves eventually won their independence with the aid of the evil god Laduguer. Slavery had forever changed them, however, darkening their spirits to make the duergar as evil as the tyrants they had escaped. Despite winning their freedom, duergar are dour, pessimistic, untrusting creatures, always toiling and complaining, with no memory of what it means to be happy or proud. Their craftsmanship and accomplishments endure, yet they are bereft of warmth or artistry.": "杜尔加人曾经是矮人，在他们的贪婪和在地底无休止的探索使他们接触到了心灵传播者。矮人被illithids囚禁了数代，最终在邪神Laduguer的帮助下赢得了独立。然而，奴役永远地改变了他们，使他们的精神变得黑暗，使duergar和他们所逃离的暴君一样邪恶。尽管赢得了自由，但duergar是沉闷、悲观、不信任的生物，总是在劳作和抱怨，对快乐或自豪意味着什么没有记忆。他们的手艺和成就经久不衰，但他们却缺乏温暖或艺术性。",
	"Duergar make war against their dwarven kin and all other subterranean races. They forge alliances when it is convenient, then break those alliances when they have nothing more to gain. They take and hold slaves to toil in the Underdark, regarding them as free labor and crude currency.": "杜尔加人对他们的矮人亲属和所有其他地下种族发动战争。他们在方便的时候结成联盟，然后在他们没有更多的利益时打破这些联盟。他们掳掠并扣留奴隶在地下世界劳作，将他们视为免费劳动力和粗劣的货币。",
	"Like dwarves, duergar have strong constitutions. Adding to their physical stamina is an incredible mental fortitude resulting from their time as slaves of the illithids. A duergar's mind is a fortress, able to shrug off charms, illusions, and other spells.": "与矮人一样，杜尔加人有强健的体魄。除了身体上的耐力之外，他们还具有令人难以置信的精神毅力，这是由于他们曾是伊里希德人的奴隶。杜尔加人的头脑是一座堡垒，能够抵御符咒、幻术和其他法术。",

	" Under the direction of their leader, Primus, modrons increase order in the multiverse in accordance with laws beyond the comprehension of mortal minds. Their own minds are networked in a hierarchal pyramid, in which each modron receives commands from superiors and delegates orders to underlings. A modron carries out commands with total obedience, utmost efficiency, and an absence of morality or ego. Modrons have no sense of self beyond what is necessary to fulfill their duties. They exist as a unified collective, divided by ranks, yet they always refer to themselves collectively. To a modron, there is no \"I,\" but only \"we\" or \"us.\"": " 在他们的领袖Primus的指导下，modrons按照凡人的思维所不能理解的法则来增加多元宇宙的秩序。他们自己的思想在一个层次分明的金字塔中联网，其中每个模子接受上级的命令，并将命令委托给下级。莫德隆以完全的服从、最高的效率和没有道德或自我的方式执行命令。除了履行职责所必需的东西，莫德隆人没有自我意识。他们作为一个统一的集体存在，按等级划分，但他们总是集体地指称自己。对摩登人来说，没有 \"我\"，只有 \"我们 \"或 \"我们\"。",

	" If a modron is destroyed, its remains disintegrate. A replacement from the next lowest rank then transforms in a flash of light, gaining the physical form of its new rank. The promoted modron is replaced by one of its underlings in the same manner, all the way to the lowest levels of the hierarchy. There, a new modron is created by Primus, with a steady stream of monodrones leaving the Great Modron Cathedral on Mechanus as a result.": " 如果一个模子被摧毁，它的残骸就会瓦解。来自下一个最低等级的替代者会在一束光中变身，获得其新等级的物理形态。晋升的模子以同样的方式被它的一个下属取代，一直到等级制度的最低层。在那里，一个新的莫德隆被普利姆斯创造出来，源源不断的莫德隆人因此离开了麦肯纳斯的大莫德隆大教堂。",

When the child is old enough to hunt for itself, the mother sends it away and abandons the den.": "雌性是ETTINS中的主导性别，它们发起ETTINS的交配仪式。在找到一个合适的巢穴后，雌性ETTIN猎取并征服雄性，雄性在她六个月的孕期中照顾并喂养她。一旦孩子出生，雄性ETT就会被释放，不再受人奴役。当孩子长大到可以自己狩猎时，母亲就会把它送走，并放弃这个巢穴。",
	"When focused on a mutually beneficial purpose or united by a common threat, an ettin can resolve its personality differences and dedicate itself fully to a task. An ettin fights with a weapon in each hand, making twin attacks directed by its respective heads. When an ettin sleeps, one of its heads remains ever alert, gaining its only moments of privacy and keeping two eyes open for any creature that disturbs its precious solitude.": "当专注于一个互利的目的或因共同的威胁而团结起来时，ETTEN可以解决其个性差异，并全身心地投入到一项任务中。ettin在战斗时，两只手都拿着武器，由其各自的头颅指挥进行双重攻击。当Etin睡觉时，它的一个头会一直保持警觉，获得仅有的隐私时刻，并睁大双眼寻找任何扰乱其宝贵孤独的生物。",
	"In ancient dialects of Common, the word \"ettin\" translates as \"ugly giant.\" Legends tell of orcs that once stumbled upon a temple to Demogorgon, the magic of which transformed them into giant mockeries of the twin-headed Prince of Demons. Driven to near madness, these creatures scattered into the wilderness to become the first ettins.": "在古代方言中，\"ETTIN \"这个词被翻译成 \"丑陋的巨人\"。传说中，兽人曾经偶然发现了德摩戈恩的神庙，神庙的魔法将他们变成了双头恶魔王子的巨大嘲讽。这些生物被逼得近乎疯狂，散落在荒野中，成为第一批埃廷人。",
	"Whatever the truth of the ettins' origin, orcs treat them as distant cousins, and orc tribes often entice ettins to serve as guards, scouts, and marauders. An ettin isn't particularly loyal to its orc handlers, but the orcs can win it over with the promise of food and loot.": "无论伊特丁的起源是什么，兽人都把它们当作远房表亲，兽人部落经常引诱伊特丁充当卫兵、侦察兵和掠夺者。兽人并不特别忠诚于其驯服者，但兽人可以用食物和战利品的承诺来赢得它。",
	"A faerie dragon is a cat-sized dragon with butterfly wings. It wears a sharp-toothed grin and expresses its delight by the twitching of its tail, its merriment fading only if it is attacked.": "小精灵龙是一只猫大小的龙，有蝴蝶翅膀。它带着尖牙的笑容，用尾巴的抽动来表达它的喜悦，只有在受到攻击时它的快乐才会消失。",
	"The only warning of a faerie dragon's presence is a stifled giggle. The dragon stays out of sight, watching invisibly as its victims contend with its pranks. When its fun is done, the dragon might reveal itself, depending on the disposition of its \"prey.\"": "小精灵龙出现的唯一警告是一声被扼杀的笑声。这条龙呆在看不见的地方，无形地看着它的受害者与它的恶作剧抗争。当它的乐趣结束时，龙可能会暴露自己，这取决于它的 \"猎物 \"的态度。",
	"A faerie dragon has a sharp mind, a fondness for treasure and good company, and a puckish sense of humor. Travelers can play to a faerie dragon's draconic nature by offering it \"treasure\" in the form of sweets, baked goods, and baubles in exchange for information or safe passage through its territory.": "法力龙有一个敏锐的头脑，喜欢财宝和好伙伴，还有一种狡猾的幽默感。旅行者可以通过提供糖果、烘烤食品和小玩意等形式的 \"宝物\"，以换取信息或安全通过它的领地，来发挥法力龙的龙性。",
	"A faerie dragon's scales change hue as it ages, moving through all the colors of the rainbow. All faerie dragons have innate spellcasting ability, gaining new spells as they mature.": "法力龙的鳞片会随着它的年龄增长而改变颜色，在彩虹的所有颜色中游走。所有的精灵龙都有与生俱来的法术能力，随着它们的成熟，会获得新的法术。",

	"A faint humanoid shape threads through the core of this wild, moving flame. A fire elemental is a force of capricious devastation. Wherever it moves, it sets its surroundings ablaze, turning the world to ash, smoke, and cinders. Water can halt its destructive progress, causing the fire elemental to shrink back, hissing and smoking in pain and rage.": "一个微弱的人形在这个狂野的、移动的火焰的核心中穿行。火元素是一种反复无常的破坏力。无论它在哪里移动，它都会把周围的环境烧毁，把世界变成灰烬、烟雾和焦炭。水可以阻止它的破坏性进展，使火元素缩回，在痛苦和愤怒中发出嘶嘶声和冒烟。",

	"Fire giant fortresses are built around and inside volcanoes or near magma-filled caverns. The blistering heat of their homes fuels the fire giants' forges, and causes the iron of their fortress walls to glow a comforting orange. In lands far removed from volcanic heat, fire giants mine coal to burn. Traditional smithies occupy places of honor in their demesnes, and the giants' stony fortresses constantly belch plumes of sooty smoke. In more remote outposts, fire giants burn wood to keep their forge fires lit, deforesting leagues of land in all directions.": "火巨人的堡垒建在火山周围和内部，或者靠近充满岩浆的洞穴。他们的家园所散发的热浪为火巨人的锻造提供了燃料，并使他们的堡垒墙体发出令人欣慰的橙色光芒。在远离火山热的地方，火巨人开采煤炭来燃烧。传统的铁匠铺在他们的领地里占据着荣誉的位置，而巨人的石质堡垒则不断地喷出烟尘的烟雾。在更偏远的前哨站，火巨人燃烧木材以保持他们的锻造火种，在各个方向上砍伐森林的土地。",

They can adapt to cold environments with effort, though, keeping their hearth fires burning bright and wearing heavy woolen clothing and furs to stay warm.": "火巨人回避寒冷，就像他们的表亲冰霜巨人讨厌热一样。不过他们可以努力适应寒冷的环境，保持炉火熊熊燃烧，穿上厚厚的羊毛衣服和毛皮以保持温暖。",
	"From birth, a fire giant is taught to embrace a legacy of war. At the cradle, its parents chant songs of battle. As children, fire giants play at war, hurling igneous rocks at one another across the banks of magma rivers. In later years, formal martial training becomes an integral part of life in the giants' fortresses and underground realms of smoke and ash.": "火巨人从出生起就被教导要接受战争的遗产。在摇篮里，它的父母高唱战斗之歌。在儿童时期，火巨人在战争中玩耍，在岩浆河两岸互相投掷火岩。到了晚年，正式的武术训练成为巨人的堡垒和地下烟尘领域生活的一个组成部分。",
	"The fire giants' songs are odes of battles lost and won, while their dances are martial formations of pounding feet that resound like smiths' hammers throughout their smoky halls.": "火巨人的歌曲是关于战斗失败和胜利的颂歌，而他们的舞蹈则是敲击脚步的武术队形，像铁匠的锤子一样响彻整个烟熏的大厅。",
	"Just as fire giants pass down their knowledge of crafting from generation to generation, their renowned fighting prowess comes not from wild fury but from endless discipline and training. Enemies make the mistake of underestimating fire giants based on their brutish manner, learning too late that these giants live for combat and can be shrewd tacticians.": "就像火巨人代代相传的工艺知识一样，他们著名的战斗力不是来自于狂暴的愤怒，而是来自于无尽的纪律和训练。敌人会因为火巨人的野蛮行为而错误地低估他们，但他们很晚才知道，这些巨人是为战斗而生的，可以成为精明的战术家。",

The serfs work the farms and fields on the outskirts of fire giant halls and fortresses, raising livestock and harvesting fields whose bounty is almost entirely tithed to the fire giant kings.": "在战争中被征服的人类成为火巨人的农奴。农奴在火巨人大厅和堡垒外围的农场和田地里工作，饲养牲畜和收割田地，而这些田地的赏赐几乎全部归于火巨人国王。",
	"Fire giant crafters work through insight and experience rather than writing or arithmetic.

Serfs not destined for court or the fields (especially dwarves) are taken to the fire giants' mountainous realms to mine ore and gemstones from deep within the earth.": "火巨人的手艺人通过洞察力和经验来工作，而不是通过书写或算术。虽然大多数火巨人并不看重这些轻浮的东西，但他们有时会在宫廷里养一些精通这些技能的奴隶。没有被安排到宫廷或田地的农奴（尤其是矮人）会被带到火巨人的山地王国，从地底深处开采矿石和宝石。",
	"Fire giants low in the ordning manage the mine tunnels and the slaves that toil there, few of which survive the difficult and dangerous work for long. Though fire giants are skilled in the engineering of mine tunnels and the gathering of ore, they place less importance on the safety of their slaves than on smelting and working the bounty those slaves produce.": "处于低位的火巨人管理着矿道和在那里劳作的奴隶，很少有奴隶能在艰难而危险的工作中长期生存。虽然火巨人精通矿道工程和矿石采集，但他们并不重视奴隶的安全，而是重视冶炼和加工这些奴隶生产的财物。",
	"Fire giants have a fearsome reputation as soldiers and conquerors, and for their ability to burn, plunder, and destroy. Yet among the giants, fire giants produce the greatest crafters and artists. They excel at smelting and smith work, as they do at the engineering of metal and stone, and the quality of their artistry shows even in their implements of destruction and their weapons of war.": "火巨人作为士兵和征服者，因其燃烧、掠夺和破坏的能力而拥有可怕的声誉。然而，在巨人中，火巨人产生了最伟大的手工艺人和艺术家。他们擅长冶炼和铁匠工作，就像他们在金属和石头的工程方面一样，他们的艺术质量甚至表现在他们的破坏工具和战争武器上。",
	"Fire giants strive to build the strongest fortresses and most potent siege weapons. They experiment with alloys to create the hardest armor, then forge the swords that can pierce it. Such work requires brawn and brains in equal measure, and fire giants high in the ordning tend to be the smartest and strongest of their kind.": "火巨人努力建造最坚固的堡垒和最有力的攻城武器。他们通过试验合金来制造最坚硬的盔甲，然后锻造出可以刺穿盔甲的剑。这样的工作需要体力和脑力并重，而处于高位的火巨人往往是最聪明和最强壮的一类人。",
	"Blazing green flames and mad, echoing laughter follow a disembodied skull as it patrols its demesne.

	"A flameskull only dimly recalls its former life. Though it might speak in its old voice and recount key events from its past, it is but an echo of its former self. However, its undead transformation grants it full access to the magic it wielded in life, letting it cast spells while ignoring the material and somatic components it can no longer employ.": "火焰骷髅只能模糊地回忆起它以前的生活。虽然它可能会用以前的声音说话，讲述过去的关键事件，但它只是以前的一个回声。然而，它的不死之身让它完全可以使用生前的魔法，让它在施展法术的同时忽略了它不能再使用的物质和身体成分。",
	"Intelligent and vigilant, a flameskull serves its creator by protecting a hidden treasure hoard, a secret chamber, or a specific individual.

	" The fire wreathing a flameskull burns continually, giving off bright light that the creature controls. It uses those flames as a weapon, focusing them to loose them as fiery rays from its eye sockets.": " 缠绕在火焰头颅上的火焰不断燃烧，散发出该生物所控制的亮光。它用这些火焰作为武器，将它们集中起来，从它的眼眶中释放出火热的光线。",
	"A flameskull's shattered fragments reform unless they are splashed with holy water or subjected to a {@spell dispel magic} or {@spell remove curse} spell.

Powerful enchantments protect the golem's skin, deflecting spells and all but the most potent weapons.": "肉体魔像是一个可怕的人形身体部件的组合，它被缝合在一起，成为一个肌肉发达的畜生，被赋予了可怕的力量。它的大脑能够进行简单的推理，尽管它的思想并不比那些年幼的孩子更复杂。傀儡的肌肉组织对雷电的力量有反应，使这个生物具有活力和力量。强大的魔法保护着巨魔的皮肤，除了最强大的武器外，还能抵御法术和所有其他武器。",
	"A flesh golem lurches with a stiff-jointed gait, as if not in complete control of its body. Its dead flesh isn't an ideal container for an elemental spirit, which sometimes howls incoherently to vent its outrage. If the spirit breaks free of its creator's will, the golem goes berserk until calmed, or until its shell of flesh is destroyed or completely healed.": "一个肉体傀儡以僵硬的步态蹒跚而行，仿佛无法完全控制自己的身体。它的死肉对于元素之灵来说并不是一个理想的容器，它有时会语无伦次地嚎叫以发泄其愤怒。如果精神挣脱了创造者的意志，巨魔就会狂暴起来，直到平静下来，或者直到它的肉壳被摧毁或完全愈合。",

	"Flumphs feed by siphoning mental energy from psionic creatures, and they can be found lurking near communities of mind flayers, aboleths, githyanki, and githzerai. As passive parasites, they take only the mental energy they need, and most creatures feel no loss or discomfort from such feeding.": "Flumphs通过吸取幻术生物的精神能量为食，它们可以在心灵感应者、Aboleths、Githyanki和Githzerai的社区附近找到潜伏。作为被动的寄生虫，它们只吸收自己需要的精神能量，大多数生物在这种吸食中不会感到损失或不适。",
	"Consuming psionic energy reveals the thoughts and emotions of the creatures on which the flumphs feed. Since so many of those creatures are evil, flumphs are often subjected to thoughts, emotions, and hungers that sicken their pure nature. When flumphs encounter good-hearted adventurers, they eagerly share the dark secrets they have learned in the hopes of casting down their evil sources of energy, even if doing so means they must seek out new sources of nourishment.": "消耗幻觉能量会显示出弗鲁姆普所依靠的生物的思想和情感。由于这些生物中很多都是邪恶的，所以弗鲁姆普经常受到思想、情感和饥饿的影响，这让他们的纯洁的本性感到恶心。当Flumphs遇到心地善良的冒险家时，他们急切地分享他们所学到的黑暗秘密，希望能消除他们邪恶的能量来源，即使这样做意味着他们必须寻找新的营养来源。",

Some have facial features randomly distributed around their misshapen, warty heads.

Their wretched appearance rarely evokes sympathy, however, for the fomorians brought their doom upon themselves with the evil that rules their hearts and minds.": "所有巨人中最丑陋、最邪恶的是无神论者，他们畸形的身体反映了他们卑劣的举止。有些人的面部特征随机地分布在他们畸形的、疣状的头部。有些人的四肢大小和形状严重不同，或者每次通过畸形的嘴吸气时都会发出可怕的嚎叫。然而，他们可悲的外表很少引起人们的同情，因为福摩瑞人用统治他们心灵的邪恶给自己带来了厄运。",
	"The elves remember when the fomorians were among the most handsome of races, possessed of brilliant minds and unrivaled magical ability. That physical perfection did not extend to their hearts, however, as a lust for magic and power consumed them.

When the fey united to defend their realm, the fomorians fought them and were subjected to a terrible curse.": "精灵们还记得，福摩瑞人是最英俊的种族之一，拥有聪明的头脑和无与伦比的魔法能力。然而，这种身体上的完美并没有延伸到他们的内心，因为对魔法和力量的欲望吞噬了他们。福摩瑞人试图征服仙界并奴役其居民，将这些生物的魔法据为己有。当精灵们联合起来保卫他们的领域时，fomorians与他们战斗，并受到了可怕的诅咒。",
	"One by one, the giants fell as their bodies were warped to reflect the evil in their hearts.

	"The fomorians dwell in eerily beautiful caverns in the Underdark, rarely venturing to the surface. Their lairs feature abundant access to water, fish, and mushroom forests, as well as to the creatures whose slave labor keeps the fomorians fed. When those slaves can no longer toil, they are slain and devoured. Wickedness and depravity are the cornerstones of fomorian society, in which the strongest and cruelest giants rule. Fomorians mark their territories with the corpses of their enemies, painting their cavern walls with blood or stitching together limbs and body parts to make mockeries of the creatures they have killed.": "福摩尔人居住在地下世界中美丽的洞穴中，很少到地表去活动。他们的巢穴有大量的水、鱼和蘑菇林，以及那些让福摩瑞人维持生计的奴隶劳动的生物。当这些奴隶不能再劳作时，他们就会被杀死和吞食。邪恶和堕落是Fomorian社会的基石，在这个社会中，最强大和最残酷的巨人统治着。福摩瑞人用敌人的尸体来标记他们的领土，用血来涂抹他们的洞穴墙壁，或者把四肢和身体部位缝在一起，以嘲弄他们所杀的生物。",
	" The deformities visited on the fomorians prevent them from hurling rocks like their giant kin, or wearing anything more than scraps of cloth. However, the grotesque positioning of their eyes, noses, and ears gives fomorians keen perceptive abilities, making it hard to surprise or ambush them. The greed and evil of the fomorians lies at the heart of their degeneration and fall, and continues to plague them. Fomorians make alliances with other creatures when it suits them, but they are disloyal by nature and betray their allies on a whim.": " 福莫瑞人身上的畸形使他们无法像他们的巨人亲属那样投掷石块，也无法穿上比碎布更多的东西。然而，他们的眼睛、鼻子和耳朵的怪异位置赋予了fomorians敏锐的感知能力，使得他们很难出其不意或遭到伏击。福摩瑞人的贪婪和邪恶是他们退化和堕落的核心，并继续困扰着他们。当适合他们时，福摩瑞人与其他生物结成联盟，但他们天性不忠，一时兴起就会背叛他们的盟友。",
	"Fomorians can pass their curse onto others using a power called the evil eye-a last vestige of the giants' once-remarkable spellcasting ability.

	"Frost giants dwell in high peaks and glacial rifts where the sun hides its golden head by winter. Crops don't grow in their frozen homelands, and they keep little livestock beyond what they capture in their raids against civilized lands. They hunt the wild game of the tundra and mountains but don't cook it, since meat from a fresh kill tastes sufficiently hot to their palate.": "冰霜巨人居住在高高的山峰和冰川裂缝中，冬天时太阳会把它的金色脑袋藏起来。在他们冰冻的家园里不生长农作物，除了在袭击文明土地时捕获的牲畜外，他们很少饲养牲畜。他们狩猎苔原和山区的野生动物，但不做饭，因为新鲜的肉对他们的味觉来说是足够热的。",
	"The war horns of the frost giants howl as they march from their ice fortresses and glacial rifts amid the howling blizzard. When that storm clears, villages and steadings lay in ruins, ravens descending to feed on the corpses of any creatures foolish or unlucky enough to stand in the giants' path.": "冰霜巨人的战争号角在呼啸的暴风雪中从他们的冰雪堡垒和冰川裂缝中行进时发出嚎叫。当暴风雪消散时，村庄和建筑都成了废墟，乌鸦降临，以任何愚蠢或不幸运地站在巨人道路上的生物的尸体为食。",
	"Inns and taverns suffer the brunt of the damage, their cellars gutted and their casks of ale and mead gone. Smithies are likewise toppled, their iron and steel claimed. Curiously undisturbed are the houses of moneylenders and wealthy citizens, for the reavers have little use for coins or baubles. Frost giants prize gems and jewelry large enough to be worn and noticed. However, even those treasures are most often saved for trading opportunities with other giants more adept at crafting metal weapons and armor.": "客栈和酒馆首当其冲受到破坏，他们的酒窖被挖空，一桶桶啤酒和蜂蜜酒不见了。铁匠铺也同样被推倒，他们的铁和钢被夺走。奇怪的是，放债人和富人的房子没有受到干扰，因为掠夺者对钱币或饰品没有什么用。霜巨人喜欢宝石和珠宝，大到可以佩戴和注意。然而，即使是这些宝物也常常被保存起来，以备与其他更擅长制作金属武器和盔甲的巨人进行交易。",
	"Frost giants respect brute strength above all else, and a frost giant's place in the ordning depends on evidence of physical might, such as superior musculature, scars from battles of renown, or trophies fashioned from the bodies of slain enemies. Tasks such as hunting, childrearing, and crafting are given to giants based on their physical strength and hardiness.": "冰霜巨人对蛮力的尊重高于一切，一个冰霜巨人在军团中的地位取决于身体力量的证明，比如卓越的肌肉组织、著名的战斗留下的伤疤，或者用被杀的敌人的尸体制成的战利品。狩猎、育儿和手工制作等任务是根据巨人的体力和耐力给予的。",
	"When frost giants of different clans meet and their status is unclear, they wrestle for dominance. Such meetings might resemble festivals where giants cheer on their champions, making bold boasts and challenges. At other times, the informal ceremony can become a chaotic free-for-all where both clans rush into a melee that fells trees, shatters the ice on frozen lakes, and causes avalanches on the snowy mountainsides.": "当不同部族的冰霜巨人相遇，而他们的地位又不明确时，他们就会为争夺统治权而搏斗。这种会议可能类似于节日，巨人们为他们的冠军欢呼，进行大胆的吹嘘和挑战。在其他时候，非正式的仪式可能会变成一场混乱的自由竞赛，两族都冲进混战中，砍伐树木，击碎冰湖上的冰块，并在雪山上引起雪崩。",
	"Though frost giants consider the menial crafting of goods beneath them, carving and leatherwork are valued skills. They make their clothing from the skins and bones of beasts, and carve bone or ivory into jewelry and the handles of weapons and tools. They reuse the weapons and armor of their smaller foes, stringing shields into scale armor and lashing sword blades to wooden hafts to make giant-sized spears. The greatest battle trophies come from conquered dragons, and the greatest frost giant jarls wear armor of dragon scales or wield picks and mauls made of a dragon's teeth or claws.": "虽然冰霜巨人认为琐碎的商品制作是他们的劣势，但雕刻和皮革加工是有价值的技能。他们用野兽的皮和骨头制作衣服，将骨头或象牙雕刻成珠宝和武器及工具的把手。他们重复使用较小的敌人的武器和盔甲，把盾牌串成鳞甲，把剑刃绑在木筏上做成巨大的矛。最伟大的战利品来自于被征服的龙，最伟大的冰霜巨人贾尔斯穿着龙鳞的盔甲，或者挥舞着用龙的牙齿或爪子做成的镐和锤子。",

Another galeb duhr might be created to guard an underground tomb or a wizard's tower. When it chooses to, the galeb duhr can make itself look like an ordinary boulder, remaining perfectly still for years at a time.": "加勒布杜尔不会衰老，也不需要营养，因此它是一个优秀的哨兵。一个强大的德鲁伊可能会让一个加勒布杜尔来保护一个石圈或神圣的山顶。另一只加勒布杜尔可能会被创造出来保护地下墓穴或巫师的塔。当它选择这样做的时候，Galeb duhr可以让自己看起来像一块普通的巨石，一次可以保持完全静止多年。",
	"A galeb duhr is permanently bound to the Material Plane, so that when it dies, it doesn't return to the Plane of Earth. It has an excellent memory and is more than happy to share information regarding its environment with creatures it doesn't regard as threats.": "Galeb duhr永久地被束缚在物质世界中，所以当它死亡时，它不会回到地球世界中。它有很好的记忆力，很乐意与它不认为是威胁的生物分享有关其环境的信息。",
	"A galeb duhr can become one with the earth around it, allowing it to imbue nearby rocks and boulders with a semblance of life. The galeb duhr uses its animated boulders to frighten away interlopers and defend whatever it has been charged to protect. When it needs to move close to those intruders, it presses its limbs tight to its body and rolls forward at a furious pace.": "加勒布杜尔能与周围的土地融为一体，使它能给附近的岩石和巨石注入生命的气息。Galeb duhr用它那有生命力的巨石来吓走入侵者，并保护它被授权保护的东西。当它需要靠近这些入侵者时，它将四肢紧贴身体，以狂暴的速度向前滚动。",
	"The inanimate gargoyles that perch atop great buildings are inspired by these malevolent creatures of elemental earth that resemble grotesque, fiendish statues. A gargoyle lurks among masonry and ruins, as still as any stone sculpture, and delights in the terror it creates when it breaks from its suspended pose, as well as the pain it inflicts on its victims.": "栖息在伟大建筑顶部的无生命的石像鬼的灵感来自于这些来自地球元素的邪恶生物，它们类似于怪诞的、恶魔般的雕像。石像鬼潜伏在砖石和废墟中，像任何石雕一样静止不动，当它从悬空的姿势中挣脱出来时，它以创造恐怖为乐，也以给受害者带来痛苦为乐。",
	"Gargoyles cling to rocky cliffs and mountains, or roost on ledges in underground caves. They haunt city rooftops, perching vulture-like among the high stone arches and buttresses of castles and cathedrals, and they can hold themselves so still that they appear inanimate. Able to maintain this state for years, a gargoyle makes an ideal sentry.": "石像鬼依附在岩石峭壁和山脉上，或在地下洞穴的壁架上栖息。它们在城市的屋顶上出没，像秃鹰一样栖息在城堡和大教堂的高大石拱门和壁垒之间，它们可以保持自己的静止，以至于看起来没有生命。夜行神龙能够保持这种状态多年，是理想的哨兵。",
	"Gargoyles have a reputation for cruelty. Statues carved into the likenesses of gargoyles appear in the architecture of countless cultures to frighten away trespassers. Although such sculptures are only decorative, real gargoyles can hide among them to ambush unsuspecting victims. A gargoyle might alleviate the tedium of its watch by catching and tormenting birds or rodents, but its long wait only increases its craving for harming sentient creatures.": "石像鬼以残忍著称。在无数文化的建筑中都出现了雕刻成石像的雕像，以吓走闯入者。虽然这种雕塑只是装饰性的，但真正的石像鬼可以藏在其中，伏击毫无戒心的受害者。石像鬼可能会通过捕捉和折磨鸟类或啮齿类动物来缓解其枯燥乏味的观察，但其漫长的等待只会增加其对伤害有生命的生物的渴望。",
	"Gargoyles are easily inspired by the cunning of an intelligent master. They enjoy simple tasks such as guarding a master's home, torturing and killing interlopers, and anything else that involves minimum effort and maximum pain and carnage.": "夜行神龙很容易受到聪明主人的狡猾启发。它们喜欢简单的任务，如守卫主人的家，折磨和杀死闯入者，以及其他任何涉及最小努力和最大痛苦与屠杀的事情。",
	"Gargoyles sometimes serve demons for their propensity for wanton chaos and destruction. Powerful spellcasters can also easily enlist gargoyle guardians to keep watch over their gates and walls. Gargoyles have the patience and fortitude of stone, and will serve even the cruelest master for years without complaint. Elemental Nature. A gargoyle doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "夜行神龙有时会为恶魔服务，因为它们有肆意制造混乱和破坏的倾向。强大的施法者也可以很容易地招募到石像鬼守护者来看守他们的大门和城墙。夜行神龙拥有石头般的耐心和毅力，即使是最残酷的主人也会毫无怨言地服务多年。元素性质。夜行神龙不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"As Ogrémoch, the evil Prince of Elemental Earth, treads his stony realm, it leaves shards of broken rock in his wake.

	"Ogrémoch doesn't create gargoyles deliberately, but they are a physical manifestation of his evil. Gargoyles are mockeries of the elemental air that Ogrémoch despises. They are heavy creatures of living stone, yet capable of flight. Like their creator, they possess a fundamental hatred for beings of elemental air, aarakocra in particular, and relish every opportunity to destroy such creatures.": "奥格雷莫赫并没有刻意创造石像鬼，但它们是他邪恶的物理表现。石像鬼是对奥格雷莫赫所鄙视的空气元素的嘲弄。它们是活生生的石头组成的沉重生物，但却能够飞行。与它们的创造者一样，它们对空气元素的生物有着根本性的憎恨，尤其是阿拉科克拉，并乐于利用一切机会来摧毁这种生物。",

	"The first gas spores are thought to have been spawned from dead beholders, whose moldering corpses fed a parasitic fungus with aberrant magic.

Taking the place of plants in the subterranean realm, fungi are vital to the survival of many underground species, providing nourishment and shelter in the unforgiving darkness.": "地下城的天空由锯齿状的石头和永恒的黑夜组成，它是各种真菌的家园。在地下世界中，真菌取代了植物，对许多地下物种的生存至关重要，在无情的黑暗中提供营养和庇护。",
	"Fungi spawn in organic matter, then break that matter down to consume it, feeding on filth and corpses. As they mature, fungi eject spores that drift on the lightest breeze to spawn new fungi.": "真菌在有机物中产卵，然后将这些物质分解吞噬，以污物和尸体为食。当它们成熟时，真菌会喷出孢子，在最轻微的微风中飘荡，以产生新的真菌。",
	"Not needing sunlight or warmth to grow, fungi thrive in every corner and crevice of the Underdark. Transformed by the magic that permeates that underground realm, Underdark fungi often develop potent defensive mechanisms or abilities of mimicry and attack. The largest specimens can spread to create vast subterranean forests in which countless creatures live and feed.": "由于不需要阳光或温暖，真菌在地下世界的每一个角落和缝隙中茁壮成长。在渗透到地下世界的魔法的改造下，地下世界的真菌经常发展出强大的防御机制或模仿和攻击能力。最大的标本可以扩散，形成巨大的地下森林，无数的生物在其中生活和觅食。",
	"A gas spore is a spherical, balloon-like fungus that resembles a beholder from a distance, though its true nature becomes increasingly obvious as one approaches it. The monster possesses a blind central \"eye\" and rhizome growths sprouting from its upper surface, superficially resembling a beholder's eyestalks.": "气体孢子是一种球形的、类似于气球的真菌，从远处看很像看门人，尽管当人们接近它时，它的真实性质会变得越来越明显。这种怪物拥有一只盲目的中央 \"眼睛 \"和从其上表面长出的根茎，从表面上看很像看门人的眼柄。",
	"A gas spore is a hollow shell filled with a lighter-than-air gas that enables it to float as a beholder does. Piercing the shell with even the weakest attack causes the creature to burst apart, releasing a cloud of deadly spores. A creature that inhales the spores becomes host to them, and is often dead within a day. Its corpse then becomes the spawning ground from which new gas spores arise.": "气体孢子是一个空壳，里面充满了比空气更轻的气体，使它能够像持币人一样漂浮。即使是最弱的攻击也能刺穿外壳，导致生物爆裂，释放出一团致命的孢子。吸入孢子的生物会成为孢子的宿主，通常在一天之内就会死亡。它的尸体会成为新的气体孢子产生的产卵地。",
	"A gas spore that sprouts from a beholder's corpse sometimes carries within it memories of its deceased parent. When the gas spore explodes, its deadly spores cast those memories adrift. Any creature that inhales the spores and survives inherits one or more of the beholder's fragmented memories, and might gain useful information about the beholder's former lair and other nearby places and creatures of interest.": "从看守者的尸体上长出的气体孢子有时会携带其已故父母的记忆。当气体孢子爆炸时，其致命的孢子会将这些记忆抛向远方。任何吸入这些孢子并存活下来的生物都会继承一个或多个看守者的碎片化记忆，并可能获得关于看守者以前的巢穴和其他附近地方以及感兴趣的生物的有用信息。",

	"A gelatinous cube is all but transparent, making it hard to spot until it attacks. A cube that is well fed can be easier to spot, since its victims' bones, coins, and other objects can be seen suspended inside the creature.": "凝胶状的立方体几乎是透明的，这使得它在攻击之前很难被发现。一个吃饱了的立方体可能更容易被发现，因为它的受害者的骨头、硬币和其他物体可以被看到悬浮在生物体内。",
	"The swarms presented here aren't ordinary or benign assemblies of little creatures. They form as a result of some sinister or unwholesome influence. A vampire can summon swarms of bats and rats from the darkest corners of the night, while the very presence of a mummy lord can cause scarab beetles to boil up from the sand-filled depths of its tomb. A hag might have the power to turn swarms of ravens against her enemies, while a yuan-ti abomination might have swarms of poisonous snakes slithering in its wake. Even druids can't charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness is borderline unnatural.": "这里介绍的蜂群并不是普通的或良性的小生物的集会。它们的形成是一些邪恶或不健康的影响的结果。吸血鬼可以从夜晚最黑暗的角落里召唤出成群的蝙蝠和老鼠，而木乃伊领主的存在可以使疥疮甲虫从充满沙子的坟墓深处沸腾起来。一个巫婆可能有能力让成群的乌鸦对付她的敌人，而一个元始天尊可能会有成群的毒蛇在它身后滑行。即使是德鲁伊也无法魅惑这些蛇群，它们的攻击性是近乎非自然的。",

	"A ghost yearns to complete some unresolved task from its life. It might seek to avenge its own death, fulfill an oath, or relay a message to a loved one. A ghost might not realize that it has died and continue the everyday routine of its life. Others are driven by wickedness or spite, as with a ghost that refuses to rest until every member of a certain family or organization is dead.": "一个鬼魂渴望完成它生命中某些未解决的任务。它可能会寻求为自己的死亡报仇，履行誓言，或向所爱的人传达一个信息。鬼魂可能没有意识到自己已经死了，而是继续其日常的生活。还有一些鬼魂是被邪恶或怨恨所驱使，如一个鬼魂拒绝休息，直到某个家庭或组织的所有成员都死了。",
	"The surest way to rid an area of a ghost is to resolve its unfinished business. A ghost can be destroyed more easily by invoking a weakness tied to its former life. The ghost of a person tortured to death might be killed again by the implements of that torture. The ghost of a gardener might become more vulnerable when exposed to a potent floral fragrance.": "摆脱鬼魂的最可靠方法是解决它未完成的事业。通过唤起与其前世有关的弱点，可以更容易地消灭鬼魂。一个被折磨致死的人的鬼魂可能会被折磨的工具再次杀死。一个园丁的鬼魂在接触到强烈的花香时可能会变得更加脆弱。",
	"Sensations of profound sadness, loneliness, and unfulfilled yearning emanate from places where ghostly hauntings occur. Strange sounds or unnatural silences create an unsettling atmosphere.

The ghost has no control over these manifestations; they simply occur.": "深刻的悲伤、孤独和未完成的渴望的感觉从发生鬼魂的地方散发出来。奇怪的声音或不自然的沉默创造了一种令人不安的气氛。在有熊熊大火的房间里会出现冷点。令人窒息的臭味可能会渗入该地区，无生命的物体可能会自行移动，尸体可能会从坟墓中爬出来。鬼魂无法控制这些表现；它们只是发生了。",

	"Like maggots or carrion beetles, ghouls thrive in places rank with decay and death. A ghoul haunts a place where it can gorge on dead flesh and decomposing organs. When it can't feed on the dead, it pursues living creatures and attempts to make corpses of them. Though they gain no nourishment from the corpses they devour, ghouls are driven by an unending hunger that compels them to consume. A ghoul's undead flesh never rots, and this monster can persist in a crypt or tomb for untold ages without feeding.": "像蛆虫或腐肉甲虫一样，食尸鬼在腐烂和死亡的地方茁壮成长。食尸鬼出没于一个它可以吞食死肉和腐烂器官的地方。当它不能以死人为食时，它就追捕活人，并试图把他们变成尸体。虽然它们没有从吞噬的尸体中获得任何营养，但食尸鬼被一种无止境的饥饿感所驱使，迫使它们进行消耗。食尸鬼的不死之肉永远不会腐烂，这种怪物可以在墓穴或坟墓中持续数年不进食。",
	"Ghouls trace their origins to the Abyss. Doresain, the first of their kind, was an elf worshiper of Orcus. Turning against his own people, he feasted on humanoid flesh to honor the Demon Prince of Undeath. As a reward for his service, Orcus transformed Doresain into the first ghoul. Doresain served Orcus faithfully in the Abyss, creating ghouls from the demon lord's other servants until an incursion by Yeenoghu, the demonic Gnoll Lord, robbed Doresain of his abyssal domain. When Orcus would not intervene on his behalf, Doresain turned to the elf gods for salvation, and they took pity on him and helped him escape certain destruction. Since then, elves have been immune to the ghouls' paralytic touch.": "食尸鬼的起源可以追溯到深渊。多雷因，他们的第一个同类，是一个崇拜奥库斯的精灵。他背叛了自己的族人，以人类的肉体为食，以纪念不死之身的恶魔王子。作为对他服务的奖励，奥库斯将多雷因变成了第一个食尸鬼。多雷因在深渊中忠实地服务于奥库斯，从恶魔领主的其他仆人中创造食尸鬼，直到恶魔地精领主耶诺古的入侵，抢走了多雷因的深渊领域。当奥库斯不为他的利益进行干预时，多雷塞恩转向精灵诸神寻求拯救，他们怜悯他并帮助他逃脱了必然的毁灭。从那时起，精灵就对食尸鬼的麻痹性触摸免疫了。",
	"Orcus sometimes infuses a ghoul with a stronger dose of abyssal energy, making a ghast. Whereas ghouls are little more than savage beasts, a ghast is cunning and can inspire a pack of ghouls to follow its commands.": "Orcus有时会给食尸鬼注入更强的深渊能量，使其成为一个食尸鬼。食尸鬼不过是野蛮的野兽，而食尸鬼则很狡猾，可以激励一群食尸鬼听从它的命令。",

Legends tell of gods that take the form of giant elk when visiting the Material Plane. Many cultures therefore believe that to hunt these creatures is to invite divine wrath.": "雄伟的巨麋鹿非常罕见，以至于它的出现常常被认为是一个重要事件的预示，比如国王的诞生。传说中，神在访问物质世界时，会变成巨麋鹿的形态。因此，许多文化认为，猎杀这些生物就是在招致神的愤怒。",

Giant spiders are most commonly found underground, making their lairs on ceilings or in dark, web-filled crevices. Such lairs are often festooned with web cocoons holding past victims.": "为了捕捉猎物，巨蛛会织出精致的网，或从腹部射出粘稠的网丝。巨型蜘蛛最常见于地下，在天花板上或黑暗的、充满网络的缝隙中做巢穴。这样的巢穴往往有很多网状的茧，里面装着过去的受害者。",
	"A giant vulture has advanced intelligence and a malevolent bent. Unlike its smaller kin, it will attack a wounded creature to hasten its end. Giant vultures have been known to haunt a thirsty, starving creature for days to enjoy its suffering.": "巨型秃鹰具有先进的智慧和恶意的倾向。与它较小的亲属不同，它将攻击一个受伤的生物，以加速其结束。众所周知，巨鹫会在饥渴、饥饿的生物身上纠缠数日，以享受它的痛苦。",

	"Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the giants' heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race's glorious dawn are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area without a fight.": "巨人几乎和龙一样古老，当巨人沉重的脚步第一次撼动世界的地基时，龙还很年轻。当他们在新的土地上传播时，巨人和龙进行了痛苦的代际战争，几乎使双方都倒下。没有一个活着的巨人记得冲突的起因，但他们种族辉煌的黎明的神话和故事仍然在他们的城堡和堡垒中传唱，诋毁原始的巫妖。巨人和龙仍然对彼此怀有怨恨，他们很少会在没有战斗的情况下相遇或占据同一地区。",

	"Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the purpose of their lives.": "巨人属于一个种姓结构，称为 \"Ordning\"。基于社会等级和高度的组织性，\"秩序 \"为每个巨人分配了一个社会等级。通过了解自己在秩序中的地位，巨人知道哪些其他巨人比它低等或优越，因为没有两个巨人是平等的。每个巨人种族都会分析不同的技能或品质组合，以确定其地位。巨人把擅长这些品质作为他们生活的目的。",
	"At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked according to status.

	"Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants.

It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.": "无论一个巨人在其自身种族中的等级如何，山地巨人部落的首领都不如最普通的石巨人。任何类型的最低等级的巨人都要优于劣等类型的最高等级的巨人。不尊重甚至背叛另一种类型的巨人并不被认为是邪恶的，只是粗鲁而已。",
	"When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants, forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon either again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly villains that make up the giants' pantheon.": "当巨人的古老帝国衰落时，所有巨人的父亲安南抛弃了他的孩子和世界。他发誓再也不看这两样东西了，直到巨人恢复了他们的荣耀，重新获得他们与生俱来的世界统治者的权利。因此，巨人不是向安纳姆祈祷，而是向他神圣的孩子们祈祷，同时还有一大批英雄神灵和神圣的恶棍，构成了巨人的万神殿。",
	"Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose sons represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden; Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster.": "这些神灵中最主要的是安南的子孙，他们的儿子代表每一种类型的巨人。斯特朗莫斯（Stronmaus）代表风暴巨人，梅姆诺（Memnor）代表云雾巨人，斯科雷欧斯（Skoraeus）代表石骨巨人，特林（Thrym）代表冰霜巨人，苏尔图尔（Surtur）代表火巨人，戈兰托（Grolantor）代表山丘巨人。然而，并不是所有的巨人都会自动崇敬他们种族的主要神灵。许多善良的云系巨人拒绝崇拜狡诈的梅姆诺尔，而居住在北方冰山的风暴巨人可能会对特里姆而不是斯特龙马斯表示敬意。其他巨人觉得与安南的女儿们有更强的联系，她们包括女猎手和家庭监护人希提亚（Hiatea）、爱与和平女神伊拉尼斯（Iallanis）以及急躁和傲慢的骗子戴安娜（Diancastra）。",
	"Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults, paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie. To worship them or any other non-giant deity is a great sin against the ordning, and almost certain to make a giant an outcast.": "一些巨人放弃了他们自己的神灵，成为恶魔崇拜的牺牲品，向巴弗梅特或科斯特奇致敬。崇拜他们或任何其他非巨人的神灵是对条例的巨大罪过，几乎可以肯定会使巨人成为被抛弃的人。",
	"Of all the terrors created by foul sorcery, gibbering mouthers are among the most wicked and depraved. This creature is the composite eyes, mouths, and liquefied matter of its former victims.

	"The githyanki despise all other races, undertaking devastating raids that take them from their strongholds in the Astral Plane to the far flung corners of the multiverse. War is the ultimate expression of githyanki culture, and their pitiless black eyes know no mercy. After a raid, they leave shattered survivors enough food and resources to weakly endure. Later, the githyanki return to their conquered foes, plundering them again and again.": "githyanki蔑视所有其他种族，进行毁灭性的袭击，把他们从星界的据点带到多元宇宙的遥远角落。战争是Githyanki文化的终极表现，他们无情的黑眼睛不懂得怜悯。在一次突袭之后，他们给破碎的幸存者留下足够的食物和资源，让他们虚弱地忍受下去。后来，Githyanki又回到他们被征服的敌人身边，一次又一次地掠夺他们。",
	"In their own language, githyanki means \"followers of Gith.\" Under the guidance of Gith, the githyanki stratified into a militaristic society, with a strict caste system, dedicated to the ongoing fight against the victims and sworn enemies of their race.

The lich-queen forbade worship of all beings except herself.": "在他们自己的语言中，githyanki意味着 \"吉斯的追随者\"。在吉斯的指导下，吉蒂扬基人分层成为一个军事化的社会，拥有严格的种姓制度，致力于与他们种族的受害者和死敌持续斗争。当他们的领袖吉斯死后，她被她的不死顾问弗拉基斯取代。荔枝女王禁止崇拜除她自己以外的所有生物。",
	"Of all their enemies, the githyanki most hate their former masters, the mind flayers. Their close kin, the githzerai, are second in their enmity. All other creatures are treated with simple contempt by the githyanki, whose xenophobic pride defines their view of inferior races.": "在所有的敌人中，Githyanki最痛恨他们以前的主人--心灵驱逐者。他们的近亲--吉斯泽拉（githzerai），是他们的第二大敌人。所有其他的生物都被吉蒂亚克人以简单的蔑视对待，他们的排外自豪感决定了他们对低等种族的看法。",

	"These silver swords channel the force of the wielder's will, dealing psychic as well as physical damage.

Only Tiamat now knows what passed between them, but Vlaakith returned to the Astral Plane with the Dragon Queen's red dragon consort Ephelomon, who proclaimed that his kind would forever act as allies to the githyanki. Not all red dragons honor the alliance kindled so long ago, but most at least don't consider the githyanki their enemies.": "在反对伊利特人的起义中，吉斯寻求盟友。她的顾问弗拉基斯向邪恶的龙族女神提亚马特求助，吉思冒险进入九层地狱与她会面。现在只有提亚马特知道他们之间发生了什么，但弗拉基斯带着龙后的红龙妃子埃菲罗蒙回到了星界，埃菲罗蒙宣称他的同类将永远作为吉特汉克的盟友。并非所有的红龙都尊重很久以前点燃的联盟，但大多数红龙至少不认为吉特亚基是他们的敌人。",
	" Since creatures that dwell on the Astral Plane don't age, the githyanki establish creches in remote areas of the Material Plane to raise their young.

	"The warlike githyanki and the contemplative githzerai are a sundered people-two cultures that utterly despise one another.

	"The progenitors of the githzerai adapted to-and were transformed by-the psychic environment imposed on them by their illithid overlords. Under the teachings of Zerthimon, who called on his people to abandon the warlike ambitions of Gith, the githzerai focused their mental energy on creating physical and psychic barriers to protect them from attack, psychic or otherwise. Fighting is personal to a githzerai, which uses its mind to daze and incapacitate opponents, leaving them vulnerable to physical punishment.": "吉斯泽拉人的祖先适应了他们的伊里西德统治者强加给他们的精神环境，并且被这种环境所改变。在Zerthimon的教导下，他号召他的人民放弃吉斯的战争野心，githzerai将他们的精神能量集中在创造物理和精神障碍上，以保护他们免受精神或其他方面的攻击。战斗是吉思塞拉伊的个人行为，它用自己的心智来迷惑对手并使其丧失能力，使其容易受到身体的惩罚。",
	"The githzerai willingly dwell in the heart of utter chaos in Limbo-a twisting, mercurial plane prone to manipulation and subjugation by githzerai minds strong enough to master it.

Using the power of their minds, the githzerai tame the plane's chaotic elements, causing them to settle into fixed and survivable forms and creating oases and sanctuaries within the maelstrom.": "然而，Limbo的力量对有意识的反应。利用他们心灵的力量，吉斯泽拉人驯服了飞机上的混乱元素，使它们变成固定的、可生存的形式，并在大漩涡中创造出绿洲和避难所。",

However, if its attempts to entice or deceive fail, a glabrezu has the strength to fight and win.": "虽然格拉布瑞兹在战斗中是毁灭性的，但他们更喜欢用权力或财富作为诱饵来诱惑受害者走向毁灭。通过狡猾、诡计和邪恶的交易，格拉布瑞兹囤积财富，用来兑现对目光短浅的召唤者和意志薄弱的凡人的承诺。然而，如果它引诱或欺骗的尝试失败了，glabrezu有力量去战斗并赢得胜利。",

Armored warriors holed up in a fortified castle will survive a rampaging gnoll horde unscathed, even as the towns, villages, and farms that surround the castle are ablaze, their people slaughtered and devoured.": "地精很危险，因为它们是随机攻击的。他们从荒野中出现，进行掠夺和屠杀，然后转移到其他地方。他们像蝗虫一样攻击，掠夺定居点，除了留下被夷为平地的建筑、被啃食的尸体和被玷污的土地外，几乎没有留下什么。地精选择容易袭击的目标。躲在坚固的城堡里的装甲战士会在地精部落的肆虐下毫发无损，即使城堡周围的城镇、村庄和农场被烧毁，人们被屠杀和吞噬。",

Even the most savage orcs avoid allying with gnolls.": " 侏儒的心中没有善良或怜悯之心。就像恶魔一样，它缺乏任何类似于良心的东西，而且无法被教导或胁迫放下其破坏性的倾向。地精狂热的嗜血性使他们成为所有人的敌人，当他们缺乏一个共同的敌人时，他们就在自己之间战斗。即使是最野蛮的兽人也避免与地精结盟。",

Depending on the number of hyenas in a region, a fang of Yeenoghu can lead to a startling increase in the gnoll population. Finding and killing the fang is the only way to keep that population in check.": "有时，恶魔领主为了奖励他的崇拜者，允许他们中的一个人被恶魔的灵魂附身。被标记为耶诺古的最爱，幸运的接受者成为耶诺古的獠牙，成为地精领主的选中者。与叶诺古创造第一批地精的方式差不多，吃了獠牙的敌人的鬣狗会发生可怕的转变，成为一个成年的地精。根据一个地区鬣狗的数量，Yeenoghu的獠牙可以导致地精数量的惊人增长。找到并杀死这种獠牙是控制人口的唯一方法。",

The crisscrossing network of trampled trails and splintered trees that surrounds a gorgon lair is strewn with the uneaten fragments of its shattered foes.": "当戈尔贡发现潜在的猎物时，它就会带着金属对金属的狰狞喧闹声冲过去。当戈尔贡撞上时，它将敌人撞得粉碎，然后用它残忍的蹄子将其踩死。面对多个敌人，戈尔贡会呼出致命的蒸汽，通过把它们变成石头来战胜它所接触的生物。当它变得饥饿时，它会把它的{@condition petrified}猎物砸成瓦砾，用它强壮的牙齿把石头磨成粉末，提供营养。围绕着戈尔贡巢穴的纵横交错的小路和分裂的树木，散落着它破碎的敌人的未被吃掉的碎片。",
	"The goristro resembles a fiendish minotaur towering more than twenty feet tall. When controlled by a demon lord, goristros make formidable living siege engines and prized pets.

A grick pack is often led by a single well-fed, oversized alpha around which the others congregate.": "砖头会一直呆在一个地区，直到食物供应减少为止，这通常是因为有生命的生物意识到了它们的存在，并在它们的巢穴周围策划了替代的路线。当暗黑世界的猎物稀少时，狮鹫就会冒险到地面上的荒野中狩猎，潜伏在树上或崖边的壁架上。一个狮鹫群通常由一个吃饱喝足、体型过大的首领领导，其他狮鹫聚集在其周围。",

A week later, the hag gives birth to a daughter who looks human until her thirteenth birthday, whereupon the child transforms into the spitting image of her hag mother.": "巫婆通过抢夺和吞噬人类婴儿进行繁殖。从摇篮或母亲的子宫里偷出婴儿后，女巫会吃掉这个可怜的孩子。一周后，女巫生下一个女儿，在她13岁生日之前，这个孩子看起来像人，然后变成了她的女巫母亲的样子。",
	"Hags sometimes raise the daughters they spawn, creating covens. A hag might also return the child to its grieving parents, only to watch from the shadows as the child grows up to become a horror.": "巫婆有时会抚养她们所生的女儿，创建巫师团。巫婆也可能将孩子送回其悲伤的父母身边，只是在阴影中看着孩子长大成为一个恐怖的人。",
	"Arrogant to a fault, hags believe themselves to be the most cunning of creatures, and they treat all others as inferior. Even so, a hag is open to dealing with mortals as long as those mortals show the proper respect and deference. Over their long lives, hags accumulate much knowledge of local lore, dark creatures, and magic, which they are pleased to sell.": "傲慢到了极点，女巫认为自己是最狡猾的生物，她们把所有其他人都视为低等生物。即便如此，只要凡人表现出适当的尊重和敬畏，女巫还是愿意与凡人打交道。在漫长的一生中，女巫积累了许多关于当地传说、黑暗生物和魔法的知识，她们很乐意出售这些知识。",
	"Hags enjoy watching mortals bring about their own downfall, and a bargain with a hag is always dangerous. The terms of such bargains typically involve demands to compromise principles or give up something dear-especially if the thing lost diminishes or negates the knowledge gained through the bargain.": "巫婆喜欢看凡人自取灭亡，与巫婆的交易总是很危险。这种交易的条款通常涉及要求妥协原则或放弃一些珍贵的东西--特别是如果失去的东西会减少或否定通过交易获得的知识。",
	"Hags love the macabre and festoon their garb with dead things and accentuate their appearance with bones, bits of flesh, and filth. They nurture blemishes and pick at wounds to produce weeping, suppurating flesh. Attractive creatures evoke disgust in a hag, which might \"help\" such creatures by disfiguring or transforming them.": "巫婆喜欢恐怖，用死物装饰自己的服装，用骨头、肉块和污秽物来突出自己的外表。她们培育瑕疵，挑剔伤口，以产生哭泣、化脓的肉体。有吸引力的生物会引起巫婆的厌恶，巫婆可能会通过毁容或改造它们来 \"帮助 \"这些生物。",
	"This embrace of the disturbing and unpleasant extends to all aspects of a hag's life. A hag might fly in a magical giant's skull, landing it on a tree shaped to resemble an enormous headless body. Another might travel with a menagerie of monsters and slaves kept in cages, and disguised by illusions to lure unwary creatures close. Hags sharpen their teeth on millstones and spin cloth from the intestines of their victims, reacting with glee to the horror their actions invoke.": "这种对令人不安和不愉快的拥抱延伸到了女巫生活的各个方面。一个女巫可能乘坐魔法巨人的头骨飞行，把它降落在一棵树上，形状就像一个巨大的无头尸体。另一个巫婆可能会带着一群被关在笼子里的怪物和奴隶旅行，并通过幻觉来伪装，引诱不知情的生物靠近。女巫在磨刀石上磨牙，用受害者的肠子织布，对他们的行为所引起的恐怖反应很高兴。",
	"Hags maintain contact with each other and share knowledge. Through such contacts, it is likely that any given hag knows of every other hag in existence. Hags don't like each other, but they abide by an ageless code of conduct. Hags announce their presence before crossing into another hag's territory, bring gifts when entering another hag's dwelling, and break no oaths given to other hags-as long as the oath isn't given with the fingers crossed.": "巫师们彼此保持联系并分享知识。通过这种联系，任何特定的女巫都有可能知道其他所有存在的女巫。女巫们彼此并不喜欢对方，但他们遵守一个不朽的行为准则。女巫在进入另一个女巫的领地之前要宣布自己的存在，在进入另一个女巫的住所时要带礼物，并且不违背给其他女巫的誓言--只要誓言不是用手指交叉着发的。",
	"Some humanoids make the mistake of thinking that the hags' rules of conduct apply to all creatures. When confronted by such an individual, a hag might find it amusing to string the fool along for a while before teaching it a permanent lesson.": "有些人犯了一个错误，以为女巫的行为准则适用于所有生物。当遇到这样的人时，女巫可能会觉得很有趣，在给它一个永久的教训之前，先把这个傻瓜串联起来。",
	"Hags dwell in dark and twisted woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed seacoasts, and gloomy swamps. In time, the landscape around a hag's lair reflects the creature's noxiousness, such that the land itself can attack and kill trespassers. Trees twisted by darkness attack passersby, while vines snake through the undergrowth to snare and drag off creatures one at a time. Foul stinking fogs turn the air to poison, and conceal pools of quicksand and sinkholes that consume unwary wanderers.": "女巫居住在黑暗和扭曲的树林中，凄凉的荒野，被风暴袭击的海岸，以及阴暗的沼泽。随着时间的推移，女巫巢穴周围的景观反映了该生物的毒性，以至于土地本身可以攻击和杀死闯入者。被黑暗扭曲的树木攻击路人，而藤蔓在灌木丛中蜿蜒，一次次地捕捉和拖走生物。恶臭的雾气将空气变成了毒药，并隐藏着流沙池和天坑，吞噬着不警惕的流浪者。",
	"When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.": "当女巫必须一起工作时，她们会组成女巫团，尽管她们有自私的天性。一个女巫团由任何类型的女巫组成，她们在团体中都是平等的。然而，每个女巫都继续渴望更多的个人权力。",

If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.": "一个巫师团由三个巫师组成，这样两个巫师之间的任何争论都可以由第三个巫师来解决。如果三个以上的女巫走到一起，就像两个巫师团发生冲突时可能发生的那样，结果通常是混乱的。",
	"While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:": "当巫师团的三个成员都在彼此的30英尺范围内时，他们可以从巫师的法术列表中各自施展以下法术，但必须在他们之间分享法术槽。",

	"A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while {@condition blinded}. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.": "一个巫师团一次只能有一个巫师之眼，创建一个新的巫师之眼需要巫师团的三个成员都进行一个仪式。仪式需要1个小时，而且女巫们在{@condition blinded}的时候不能执行。在仪式过程中，如果女巫们除了进行仪式外还采取任何行动，他们必须重新开始。",
	"When an ogre mates with a human, hobgoblin, bugbear, or orc, the result is always a half-ogre. (Ogres don't mate with dwarves, halflings, or elves. They eat them.) Human mothers rarely survive the birth of a half-ogre offspring.": "当食人魔与人类、哥布林、虫人或兽人交配时，其结果总是一个半食人魔。(食人魔不与矮人、半身人或精灵交配，它们会吃掉它们。）人类的母亲很少能在半食人魔的后代出生后存活。",

The average adult specimen stands between 9 and 10 feet tall and weighs close to a thousand pounds.": "食人魔的思想和他们强壮的身体一样懒惰。他们以掠夺、搜刮和杀戮为生，以获取食物和乐趣。一般来说，成年标本的身高在9到10英尺之间，体重接近1000磅。",
	" Ogres are notorious for their quick tempers, which flare at the smallest perceived offense. Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre's wrath in an instant-as can stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or prodding it, laughing, making faces, or simply looking at it the wrong way. When its rage is incited, an ogre lashes out in a frustrated tantrum until it runs out of objects or creatures to smash.": " 食人魔因其快速的脾气而臭名昭著，他们会因为最小的冒犯行为而大发雷霆。侮辱和辱骂可以在瞬间激起食人魔的怒火--就像从它那里偷东西、撞它、刺它、戳它、笑它、做鬼脸，或者只是用错误的方式看它一样。当它的愤怒被激起时，食人魔会在沮丧中发脾气，直到它没有东西或生物可砸。",
	"An ogre sleeps in caves, animal dens, or under trees until it finds a cabin or isolated farmhouse, whereupon it kills the inhabitants and lairs there. Whenever it is bored or hungry, an ogre ventures out from its lair, attacking anything that crosses its path. Only after an ogre has depleted an area of food does it move on.": "食人魔睡在山洞、动物的巢穴或树下，直到它找到一个小木屋或孤立的农舍，然后它就会杀死居民并在那里筑巢。每当它感到无聊或饥饿时，食人魔就会从它的巢穴中冒险出来，攻击任何与它相交的东西。只有在食人魔耗尽了一个地区的食物后，它才会继续前进。",
	"Whenever possible, ogres gang up with other monsters to bully or prey on creatures weaker than themselves. They associate freely with goblinoids, orcs, and trolls, and practically worship giants. In the giants' complex social structure (known as the ordning), ogres rank beneath the lowest giants in status. As a result, an ogre will do nearly anything a giant asks.": "只要有可能，食人魔就会与其他怪物结成团伙，欺负或掠夺比自己弱小的生物。他们与哥布林人、兽人和巨魔自由交往，并且几乎崇拜巨人。在巨人复杂的社会结构中（被称为Ordning），食人魔的地位低于最低的巨人。因此，食人魔几乎会按照巨人的要求做任何事情。",
	" Ogres eat almost anything, but they especially enjoy the taste of dwarves, halflings, and elves. When they can, they combine dinner with pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before eating them raw. If enough of its victim remains after the ogre has gorged itself, it might make a loincloth from its quarry's skin and a necklace from its leftover bones. This macabre crafting is the height of ogre culture.": " 食人魔几乎什么都吃，但它们特别喜欢矮人、半身人和精灵的味道。当它们可以的时候，它们会把晚餐和快乐结合起来，在生吃之前追着到处乱跑的受害者。如果食人魔在大快朵颐之后还剩下足够多的受害者，它可能会用猎物的皮肤制作一件腰布，用剩下的骨头制作一条项链。这种可怕的手工艺是食人魔文化的高峰。",
	" An ogre's eyes glitter with avarice when it sees the possessions of others. Ogres carry rough sacks on their raids, which they fill with fabulous \"treasure\" taken from their victims. This might include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig. Ogres also delight in the gleam of gold and silver, and they will fight one another over small handfuls of coins. Smarter creatures can earn an ogre's trust by offering it gold or a weapon forged for a creature of its size.": " 当食人魔看到别人的财产时，它的眼睛会闪烁着贪婪的光芒。食人魔在突袭时携带粗糙的麻袋，里面装满了从受害者身上夺来的神话般的 \"财宝\"。这可能包括一个破旧的头盔、一个发霉的奶酪轮、一块像斗篷一样的粗糙的动物皮毛，或者一只尖叫的、溅满泥浆的猪。食人魔也喜欢金银的光泽，它们会为了一小撮硬币而相互争斗。聪明的生物可以通过向食人魔提供黄金或为它这种体型的生物锻造的武器来赢得它的信任。",
	" Few ogres can count to ten, even with their fingers in front of them. Most speak only a rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of Common words. Ogres believe what they are told and are easy to fool or confuse, but they break things they don't understand. Silver-tongued tricksters who test their talents on these savages typically end up eating their eloquent words-and then being eaten in turn.": " 很少有食人魔能数到10，即使是用手指在他们面前数。大多数人只说一种初级形式的巨人语，并知道一些零星的通用语。食人魔相信他们被告知的东西，很容易被愚弄或迷惑，但他们会破坏他们不理解的东西。在这些野蛮人身上测试他们的才能的银舌骗子，通常最终会吃掉他们的雄辩，然后反过来被吃掉。",
	" Ogres clothe themselves in animal pelts and uproot trees for use as crude tools and weapons. They create stone-tipped javelins for hunting. When they establish lairs, they settle near the rural edges of civilized lands, taking advantage of poorly protected livestock, undefended larders, and unwary farmers.": " 食人魔以动物皮毛为衣，并将树木连根拔起，作为粗陋的工具和武器使用。他们制造石尖标枪用于打猎。当他们建立巢穴时，他们定居在文明土地的农村边缘，利用保护不力的牲畜、不设防的贮藏室和不警惕的农民。",
	" Ogres sometimes band together in small, nomadic groups, but they lack a true sense of tribalism. When bands of ogres meet, one might attempt to capture the members of the other group to increase its numbers. However, ogre bands are just as likely to trade members freely, especially if the welcoming band is temporarily flush with food and weapons.": " 食人魔有时会组成小型的游牧团体，但他们缺乏真正的部落意识。当食人魔的队伍相遇时，其中一个可能会试图捕获另一个队伍的成员以增加其数量。然而，食人魔团伙也有可能自由地交换成员，尤其是当欢迎他们的团伙暂时有充足的食物和武器时。",
	"When a dragon in polymorphed form mates with another creature, the union sometimes produces half dragon offspring. A creature might also transform into a half-dragon as a result of a mad wizard's spell or a ritual bath in dragon's blood. In all these cases, the result is a creature that combines the essence of a dragon with the form of its original race. Regardless of their origins, all half-dragons have similar features and appearance, gaining special senses, resistance to destructive energy, and a breath weapon.": "当一条多角化的龙与另一种生物交配时，这种结合有时会产生半龙的后代。一个生物也可能因为疯狂巫师的咒语或在龙血中的仪式而转变为半龙人。在所有这些情况下，其结果是一个结合了龙的精髓和其原始种族的形式的生物。无论他们的起源如何，所有的半龙人都有类似的特征和外观，获得特殊的感官，对破坏性能量的抵抗力，以及一种呼吸武器。",
	"Half-dragons are incapable of having natural born offspring. Those that wish to propagate must find other ways to do so, almost always involving magic. By way of compensation, half dragons are blessed with long life.

	"Half-dragons inherit personality traits common to their draconic heritage, so that half-gold dragons are often shy and secretive, while half-copper dragons are impish and playful. Half-green dragons are deceitful, while half-white dragons are often dim-witted brutes. These traits are tempered by a half-dragon's other lineage, but greed, arrogance, and paranoia are qualities that even good-aligned half-dragons often possess.": "半龙继承了其龙族遗产的共同个性特征，因此半金龙通常是害羞和神秘的，而半铜龙则是淘气和俏皮的。半绿龙是欺骗性的，而半白龙往往是愚蠢的野蛮人。这些特质会被半龙的其他血统所克制，但贪婪、傲慢和偏执是即使是好的半龙也经常拥有的品质。",
	"A beast, humanoid, giant, or monstrosity can become a half-dragon. When a creature becomes a half-dragon, it retains all its statistics except as noted below.": "野兽、人形生物、巨人或畸形生物都可以成为半龙人。当一个生物成为半龙人时，它保留了所有的统计数据，除了下面提到的。",

	"Long ago, an elf wandering a forest heard birdsong so pure and wholesome that she was moved to tears. Following the music, she came upon a clearing where stood a handsome elf youth who had also paused to hear the bird's song. This was Fenmarel Mestarine, a reclusive elf god. His divine presence stole her heart as he fled, vanishing into the woods as if he was never there.": "很久以前，一个精灵在森林里闲逛，听到的鸟鸣声是如此的纯洁和健康，她被感动得流下了眼泪。顺着音乐，她来到一片空地，那里站着一个英俊的精灵青年，他也停下来听鸟鸣。这就是芬梅尔-梅斯塔林，一个隐居的精灵神。他的神圣存在偷走了她的心，因为他逃走了，消失在树林里，仿佛他从未出现过。",
	"Though the elf searched the woods and called for her stranger, she found no sign of his passage. Driven to despair by her longing, she begged the gods to help her. Aerdrie Faenya, elf goddess of the sky, heard the elf's cries and was moved to her aid. She appeared as the bird whose song had entranced the outcast god, then taught that song of beauty and seduction to the elf.": "尽管精灵在树林中寻找她的陌生人，但她没有发现他经过的迹象。她被自己的渴望逼到了绝望的境地，她乞求众神帮助她。Aerdrie Faenya，精灵的天空女神，听到了精灵的呼喊，被感动了，帮助她。她以鸟的身份出现，她的歌声使被遗弃的神灵着迷，然后把那首美丽和诱惑的歌声教给了精灵。",
	"When her singing failed to draw Fenmarel Mestarine to her side, the elf cursed the gods, invoking a dreadful power and transforming her into the first harpy. The curse worked its magic on the elf's spirit as well as her body, turning her desire for love into a hunger for flesh, even as her beautiful song continued to draw creatures to her deadly embrace.": "当她的歌声没能吸引芬梅尔-梅斯塔林到她身边时，精灵诅咒了诸神，召唤出一种可怕的力量，将她变成了第一只鹰嘴兽。诅咒在精灵的精神和身体上施展了魔法，把她对爱情的渴望变成了对肉体的饥渴，即使她美丽的歌声继续吸引生物到她致命的怀抱。",
	"To hear a harpy's song is to hear music more beautiful than anything else in the world. A traveler that succumbs to the entrancing effect of that singing is compelled to blunder toward its source. A harpy sometimes charms victims before it attacks, but a more effective use of its song is to lure prey over cliffs, into bogs and quicksand, or into deadly pits. Creatures trapped or incapacitated then become easy targets for the harpy's wrath.": "听到女妖的歌声就是听到了比世界上任何东西都要美丽的音乐。一个旅行者如果屈服于这种歌声的诱人效果，就会被迫向它的源头走去。鹰身女妖有时会在攻击前对受害者施展魅力，但它的歌声更有效的用途是把猎物引到悬崖上、沼泽和流沙中，或引到致命的坑里。被困或丧失能力的生物就会成为海妖愤怒的目标。",
	"Harpies haunt bleak coastal cliffs and other places hazardous to non-flying creatures. Harpies have no interest in a fair fight, and they never attack unless they have a clear advantage. If a fight turns against a harpy, it lacks the cunning to adapt and will flee and go hungry rather than risk straight-up combat.": "鹞鹰出没于荒凉的海岸悬崖和其他对非飞行生物有害的地方。鹞子对公平的战斗没有兴趣，除非它们有明显的优势，否则它们从不攻击。如果战斗对哈比不利，它就会缺乏狡猾的适应能力，并会逃跑和挨饿，而不是冒险直接战斗。",

A harpy takes its time dismembering a helpless foe and can spend days torturing a victim before the merciful end.": "攻击时，鹞鹰会玩弄它们的食物，以受害者尖叫时发出的 \"音乐 \"为乐。鹰身女妖会慢慢地肢解一个无助的敌人，在仁慈的结束之前可以花上几天时间折磨一个受害者。",
	"Harpies take shiny baubles, valuable objects, and other trophies from their victims, sometimes fighting with each other for the right to claim the choicest prizes. When no valuable objects can be found, a harpy takes hair, bones, or body parts to line its nest.

	"Though it takes more magical resources to create a helmed horror than a lesser suit of animated armor, the helmed horror requires less direction and maintenance as it carries out its appointed tasks. A helmed horror follows its orders with complete loyalty, and is intelligent enough to understand the difference between an order's intent and its exact wording. Unlike many constructs, it seeks to fulfill the former rather than slavishly follow the latter.": "虽然创造一个有盔甲的恐怖需要更多的魔法资源，但有盔甲的恐怖在执行其指定的任务时需要更少的指导和维护。盔甲恐怖完全忠诚地遵守它的命令，并且足够聪明，能够理解命令的意图和它的确切措辞之间的区别。与许多构造物不同，它寻求完成前者，而不是一味地遵循后者。",
	"A helmed horror fights with the cunning of a skilled warrior, taking to the air as it attacks weaker characters and spellcasters first. However, a helmed horror lacks the insight to change its environment, fortify it, or otherwise take active measures to improve its defensive position.": "带头盔的恐怖兽以熟练的战士的狡猾进行战斗，当它首先攻击较弱的角色和施法者时，就会飞到空中。然而，头盔恐怖者缺乏改变环境、加固环境或采取其他积极措施来改善其防御状况的洞察力。",

Their skins are tan from lives spent lumbering up and down the hilly slopes and dozing beneath the sun. Their weapons are uprooted trees and rocks pulled from the earth. The sweat of their bodies adds to the reek of the crude animal skins they wear, poorly stitched together with hair and leather thongs.": "山地巨人居住在世界各地的山丘和山谷中，聚集在用粗糙的木材建造的棚屋中，或聚集在防御严密的泥瓦屋中。他们的皮肤被晒得黝黑，因为他们一生都在山坡上伐木，在阳光下打瞌睡。他们的武器是连根拔起的树木和从地里挖出的石头。他们身上的汗水使他们身上的粗糙兽皮更加臭气熏天，这些兽皮是用头发和皮筋拙劣地缝合在一起的。",
	"In a hill giant's world, humanoids and animals are easy prey that can be hunted with impunity. Creatures such as dragons and other giants are tough adversaries. Hill giants equate size with power.": "在山地巨人的世界里，人类和动物是容易被猎杀的猎物，可以肆无忌惮地猎杀。像龙和其他巨人这样的生物则是强悍的对手。山地巨人将大小与力量等同起来。",
	"Hill giants don't realize they follow an ordning. They know only that other giants are larger and stronger than they are, which means they are to be obeyed. A hill giant tribe's chief is usually the tallest and fattest giant that can still move about. Only on rare occasion does a hill giant with more brains than bulk use its cunning to gain the favor of giants of higher status, cleverly subverting the social order.": "山地巨人们并没有意识到他们遵循的是一条法令。他们只知道其他巨人比他们大，比他们强，这意味着他们要服从命令。一个山地巨人部落的首领通常是最高、最胖、还能走动的巨人。只有在极少数情况下，一个头脑比体积大的山地巨人才会利用自己的狡猾来获得地位更高的巨人的青睐，巧妙地颠覆社会秩序。",
	"With nothing else to occupy them, hill giants eat as often as possible. A hill giant hunts and forages alone or with a dire wolf companion, so as to not have to share with other tribe members. The giant eats anything that isn't obviously deadly, such as creatures known to be poisonous. Rotten meat is fair game, though, as are decaying plants and even mud.": "由于没有其他东西可以占据他们，山地巨人尽可能多地进食。山地巨人独自狩猎和觅食，或与地狼同伴一起，这样就不必与其他部落成员分享。巨人吃任何不明显致命的东西，如已知有毒的生物。不过，腐烂的肉是公平的，腐烂的植物甚至是泥土也是如此。",
	"Farmers fear and loathe hill giants. Where a predator such as an ankheg might burrow through fields and consume a cow or two before being driven off, a hill giant will consume a whole herd of cattle before moving on to sheep, goats, and chickens, then tearing into fruits, vegetables, and grain. If a farm family is at hand, the giant might snack on them too.": "农民们害怕和厌恶山地巨人。像安克希格这样的食肉动物可能会钻过田地，吃掉一两头牛就被赶走，而山地巨人会吃掉一整群牛，然后再吃掉绵羊、山羊和鸡，然后再撕咬水果、蔬菜和谷物。如果有一个农场家庭在附近，巨人可能也会把他们吃掉。",
	"The hill giants' ability to digest nearly anything has allowed them to survive for eons as savages, eating and breeding in the hills like animals. They have never needed to adapt and change, so their minds and emotions remain simple and undeveloped.": "山地巨人几乎可以消化任何东西的能力使他们能够作为野蛮人生存了好几个世纪，像动物一样在山里吃东西和繁殖。他们从不需要适应和改变，所以他们的思想和情感仍然简单而不发达。",
	"With no culture of their own, hill giants ape the traditions of creatures they manage to observe for a time before eating them. They don't think about their own size and strength, however. Tribes of hill giants attempting to imitate elves have been known to topple entire forests by trying to live in trees. Others attempting to take over humanoid towns or villages get only as far as the doors and windows of a building, taking out its walls and roof as they attempt to enter.": "由于没有自己的文化，山地巨人模仿他们设法观察了一段时间的生物的传统，然后再吃掉它们。然而，他们并不考虑自己的体型和力量。试图模仿精灵的山地巨人部落已经知道，他们试图住在树上而推翻了整个森林。还有一些试图占领人形城镇或村庄的巨人，在试图进入建筑物时，只走到建筑物的门和窗前，就把墙壁和屋顶拆了。",
	"In conversation, hill giants are blunt and direct, and they have little concept of deception. A hill giant might be fooled into running from another giant if a number of villagers cover themselves in blankets and stand on one another's shoulders holding a giant-painted pumpkin head. Reasoning with a hill giant is futile, although clever creatures can sometimes encourage a giant to take actions that benefit them.": "在交谈中，山地巨人直率而直接，而且他们对欺骗没有什么概念。如果一些村民用毯子盖住自己，站在对方的肩膀上，拿着一个巨人画的南瓜头，山地巨人可能会被骗得从另一个巨人手中跑掉。与山丘巨人讲道理是徒劳的，尽管聪明的生物有时可以鼓励巨人采取有利于他们的行动。",
	"A hill giant that feels as though it has been deceived, insulted, or made into a fool vents its terrible wrath on anything it encounters. Even after smashing those who offended it into pulp, the giant rampages until its rage abates, it notices something more interesting, or it grows hungry.": "一个山丘巨人觉得自己被欺骗了，被侮辱了，或者被愚弄了，就对它遇到的任何东西发泄它可怕的怒火。即使在把冒犯它的人打成肉酱之后，巨人也会横冲直撞，直到它的怒火消退，注意到更有趣的东西，或者它变得饥饿。",
	"If a hill giant proclaims itself king over a territory where other humanoids live, it rules strictly by terror and tyranny. Its decisions shift with its mood, and if it forgets the title it bestowed upon itself, it might eat its subjects on a whim.": "如果一个山丘巨人宣称自己是一个有其他人类居住的领地的国王，它就会严格按照恐怖和暴政进行统治。它的决定会随着它的情绪而改变，如果它忘记了它赋予自己的称号，它可能会一时兴起吃掉它的臣民。",
	"A beast whose magical origins are lost to history, a hippogriff possesses the wings and forelimbs of an eagle, the hindquarters of a horse, and a head that combines the features of both animals.": "河马是一种神奇的野兽，其起源已被历史遗忘，它拥有鹰的翅膀和前肢，马的后躯，以及结合两种动物特征的头部。",
	"Reclusive and omnivorous, hippogriffs mate for life and seldom venture more than a few miles from their nest. When defending its mate or its young, a hippogriff fights to the death. Hippogriffs don't lay eggs but give birth to live young.": "隐蔽和杂食的河马，终生交配，很少冒险离开它们的巢穴超过几英里。当保护其配偶或幼崽时，河马会拼命战斗。河马不产卵，但会生下活的小河马。",
	"Dragons, griffons, and wyverns have a taste for hippogriff meat and frequently prey on these creatures.": "龙、狮鹫和翼龙都喜欢吃河马的肉，并经常捕食这些生物。",
	"A hippogriff raised in captivity can be trained to be a faithful companion and mount. Of all the creatures that can serve as flying mounts, hippogriffs are among the easiest to train and the most loyal once trained properly.": "圈养的河马可以被训练成一个忠实的伙伴和坐骑。在所有可以作为飞行坐骑的生物中，河马是最容易训练的，一旦训练得当，也是最忠诚的。",
	"War horns sound, stones fly from catapults, and the thunder of a thousand booted feet echoes across the land as hobgoblins march to battle. Across the borderlands of civilization, settlements and settlers must contend with these aggressive humanoids, whose thirst for conquest is never satisfied.": "战争的号角响起，石块从弹射器中飞出，一千只脚踏的雷声在这片土地上回荡，妖精们正在向战场进军。在文明的边界地区，定居点和定居者必须与这些好斗的人形生物抗衡，他们对征服的渴望永远不会满足。",
	"Hobgoblins have dark orange or red-orange skin, and hair ranging from dark red-brown to dark gray. Yellow or dark brown eyes peer out beneath their beetling brows, and their wide mouths sport sharp and yellowed teeth. A male hobgoblin might have a large blue or red nose, which symbolizes virility and power among goblinkin. Hobgoblins can live as long as humans, though their love of warfare and battle means that few do.": "霍布金人有深橙色或橘红色的皮肤，头发从深红褐色到深灰色不等。黄色或深棕色的眼睛在他们的眉毛下探出头来，他们宽大的嘴里有锋利而发黄的牙齿。男性霍布林斯人可能有一个蓝色或红色的大鼻子，这在霍布林斯人中象征着阳刚之气和力量。霍布林人可以像人类一样长寿，尽管他们对战争和战斗的热爱意味着很少有人能做到。",
	"Hobgoblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. They are often found lording over their cousins, the smaller goblins and the ferocious bugbears.": "霍布林属于一个叫做地精的生物家族。他们经常被发现霸占他们的表亲，较小的哥布林和凶猛的虫熊。",
	"A hobgoblin measures virtue by physical strength and martial prowess, caring about nothing except the opportunity to demonstrate skill and cunning in battle. Hobgoblins of high military rank attain their positions by force, then hold those positions by imposing their authority through draconian measures.": "妖精以体力和武功来衡量美德，除了有机会在战斗中展示技巧和狡猾外，他们什么都不在乎。军衔高的霍格布林通过武力获得他们的地位，然后通过严酷的措施将他们的权威强加于人，从而保持这些地位。",
	"Hobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other military devices. Organized and disciplined, they take exceptional care of their weapons, armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold colors associated with their tribes, and trim their often-elaborate uniforms with blood-red piping and leather dyed black.": "霍布金人训练使用各种武器作战，并且在制作武器、盔甲、攻城器械和其他军事装置方面有很高的技能。他们有组织、有纪律，对他们的武器、盔甲和个人财产都非常小心。他们喜欢与他们部落相关的大胆色彩，用血红色的镶边和染成黑色的皮革修饰他们经常精心制作的制服。",
	"Hobgoblins organize themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed by a warlord with several captains serving under its command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.": "霍布林把自己组织成被称为军团的部落队伍。在他们的军事社会中，每个妖精都有一个等级，从强大的领导者和冠军，到普通的步兵，再到发现自己被驱赶到前线的矛头的妖精。一个军团由一个军阀领导，有几个队长在其指挥下工作。妖精军阀是一个无情的暴君，对战略、胜利、荣耀、声誉和统治权更感兴趣，而不是带领部队作战。",
	"As loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between legions erupt in violence if troops aren't restrained, and only exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the battlefield.": "就像地精在他们自己的军团中一样忠诚和有纪律，敌对的军团为了声誉和地位不断竞争。如果部队不受约束，军团之间的会议就会爆发暴力，只有特别强大的领导人才能迫使军团在战场上合作。",
	"Hobgoblins have a strong grasp of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated battle plans under the direction of a strategically minded leader. However, they hate elves and attack them first in battle over any other opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.": "霍布林对战术和纪律有很强的把握，在一个有战略头脑的领导者的指挥下，可以执行复杂的战斗计划。然而，他们憎恨精灵，在战斗中首先攻击精灵而不是其他对手，即使这样做是一个战术错误。",

	"Hobgoblins have a long history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races, they use oxen and horses to transport goods and weaponry over long distances. They communicate with each other using trained ravens, and keep vicious wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the same way that goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts.": "霍布林人在训练动物服务方面有着悠久的历史。像更多的文明种族一样，他们使用牛和马来长途运输货物和武器装备。他们用训练有素的乌鸦相互沟通，并饲养恶狼来看守囚犯和保护霍布林人的营地。哥布林骑兵使用训练有素的虫子作为骏马，就像哥布林骑狼一样。有些部落甚至饲养食肉猿作为战斗兽。",
	"Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in strategically advantageous locations, which they then use as staging areas to expand their territory.": "游民要求拥有丰富资源的土地，他们可以在森林和山区、矿区和人形定居点附近，以及任何可以找到木材、金属和潜在奴隶的地方找到。他们在具有战略优势的地方建立和征服据点，然后将其作为扩张领土的集结地。",
	"Hobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but they don't take up arms lightly. Before they attack, hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their foes. When assaulting a stronghold, they surround it first to cut off escape routes and supply lines, then slowly starve their enemies out.": "妖精军阀从不厌倦战斗，但他们不会轻易拿起武器。在进攻之前，地精会进行彻底的侦察，以衡量敌人的实力和弱点。当攻击一个据点时，他们首先包围它以切断逃跑路线和供应线，然后慢慢地把敌人饿死。",
	"Hobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering existing defenses with innovations of their own. Whether they lair in cavern complexes, dungeons, ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude catapults or ballistas.": "霍布林强化自己的财产，用自己的创新来加强现有的防御。无论他们的巢穴是在洞穴群、地牢、废墟还是森林中，他们都会用沟渠、栅栏、大门、守卫塔、坑道陷阱和粗糙的弹射器或弹道来保护他们的据点。",
	"Hobgoblins worship Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the greater god of goblinoids. As terrifying as this figure is, hobgoblins don't fear death, believing that when they die in battle, their spirits join the honored ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane of Acheron.": "妖精们崇拜伟大的马格鲁比耶特，他是妖精们的大神。尽管这个人物很可怕，但地精们并不害怕死亡，他们相信当他们在战斗中死去时，他们的灵魂会加入马格鲁比耶特在阿克伦星球上的军队的光荣行列。",

	"A homunculus is a construct that acts as an extension of its creator, with the two sharing thoughts, senses, and language through a mystical bond. A master can have only one homunculus at a time (attempts to create another one always fail), and when its master dies, the homunculus also dies.": "同体人是一种构造物，作为其创造者的延伸，两者通过一种神秘的联系分享思想、感官和语言。主人一次只能拥有一个同体人（创造另一个的尝试总是失败），当它的主人死亡时，同体人也会死亡。",
	"A homunculus knows everything its creator knows, including all the languages the creator can speak and read. Likewise, everything the construct senses is known to its master, even over great distances, provided both are on the same plane. Functioning as a spy, a scout, an emissary, or a messenger, a homunculus is an invaluable servant for a spellcaster engaged in secret experimentation or adventuring.": "一个同体人知道它的创造者所知道的一切，包括创造者所能说和读的所有语言。同样，它的主人也知道它所感知的一切，即使是在很远的地方，只要双方都在同一个平面上。作为一个间谍、侦察员、使者或信使，同形体是从事秘密实验或冒险的施法者的一个无价的仆人。",
	"A fierce predator of the Underdark, the hook horror aggressively defends its hunting grounds. The subterranean caverns where these creatures dwell echo with the constant clacking and scraping of their hooks as they wend their way up cliffs and along cavern walls.

It gains its name from its long, powerfully built arms and legs, which end in wickedly curved hooked claws.": "作为暗黑世界中凶猛的掠食者，钩状恐怖兽积极地保卫着自己的狩猎场。在这些生物居住的地下洞穴中，当它们沿着悬崖和洞壁蜿蜒而上时，它们的钩子不断发出咔嚓咔嚓的声音。恐怖的钩子有一个类似秃鹰的头和一个巨大甲虫的躯干，外骨骼上有尖锐的骨质突起。它的名字来自于其长而有力的手臂和腿，末端是邪恶的弯曲的钩爪。",

What sounds to others like random clacking noise is actually a complex language that only hook horrors understand, and which carries for miles through the echoing Underdark.": " 钩子恐怖通过用它们的钩子敲击它们的外骨骼或它们周围的石头表面进行交流。在其他人听来，这听起来像是随机的咔哒声，实际上是一种复杂的语言，只有钩子恐怖才听得懂，而且能在回声的地下世界中传播数英里。",
	"The omnivorous hook horrors eat lichens, fungi, plants, and any creature they can catch. A hook horror's hooked limbs give it excellent purchase on rock surfaces, and these creatures use their climbing skills to ambush prey from above. They hunt in packs, working together against the largest and most dangerous opponents. If a battle goes poorly, a hook horror quickly climbs a cavern wall to flee.": "杂食性的钩子恐怖吃地衣、真菌、植物和任何它们能抓到的生物。钩状恐怖的钩状肢体使其在岩石表面有很好的附着力，这些生物利用其攀爬技能从上面伏击猎物。它们成群结队地狩猎，共同对付最大和最危险的对手。如果战斗进行得不顺利，钩状恐怖兽会迅速爬上洞壁逃走。",

Hook horrors lay eggs, which are clustered in a central, well-defended area of a clan's home caverns.": "勾魂兽生活在大家庭或氏族中。每个氏族都由最年长的女性统治，她通常让她的配偶负责氏族的狩猎者。钩角兽会产卵，这些卵集中在一个氏族的家庭洞穴中一个防御严密的中心区域。",

When they are sufficiently provoked or antagonized, the fury of these fiends can be terrifying.": "角魔懒惰到好战的地步，不愿意把自己置于危险的境地。此外，它们憎恨并害怕任何比自己更强大的生物。当它们被充分激怒或对抗时，这些恶魔的愤怒会让人感到恐惧。",

Great champions are known to test their mettle against these fearsome creatures.": "九头蛇是一种恐怖的爬行动物，拥有鳄鱼般的身体和长长的蛇形脖子上的多个头。虽然它的头可以被砍掉，但九头蛇会在短时间内神奇地重新长出头来。一个典型的标本有五个头。在时间的黎明，邪恶的龙后提亚马特（Tiamat）杀死了一个名叫勒奈亚（Lernaea）的对手龙神，并将她的血投向整个多元宇宙。每一滴落在一个世界上都会产生一个多头的九头蛇，它被一种与堕落之神的仇恨一样巨大的饥饿感所吞噬。众所周知，伟大的冠军们会在这些可怕的生物面前测试他们的能力。",
	"A rapacious and gluttonous monster, a hydra snatches and tears apart its prey in a frenzy of feeding. When a hydra has cleared a territory of food and driven off any creatures smart enough to avoid it, it moves on to seek its meals elsewhere.

	"Hydras are natural swimmers, dwelling in rivers, along lakeshores, in ocean shallows, and in wetland bogs. A hydra rarely requires shelter from the elements, so it doesn't normally have a lair. Only in colder climes are hydras drawn to the protection of sheltered caverns and ruins. When a hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads remains awake and alert, making the creature difficult to catch by surprise.": "水螅是天然的游泳者，居住在河流、湖岸、海洋浅滩和湿地沼泽中。水螅很少需要避风的地方，所以它通常没有巢穴。只有在较冷的气候下，水螅才会被吸引到有保护的洞穴和废墟中。当水螅睡觉时，它至少有一个头保持清醒和警惕，这使得它很难被突然抓住。",
	"Found most commonly on the cold layers of Stygia and Cania, ice devils serve as commanders of the infernal armies of the Nine Hells, tormenting lesser devils as an outlet for their anger and resentment.

A spell that allows someone to see the invisible reveals only the invisible stalker's vague outline.": "隐形潜行者由空气组成，自然不可见。生物可能会听到和感觉到隐形潜行者的声音，但即使是在攻击时，这种元素也是隐形的。一个能让人看到隐形者的法术只显示出隐形潜行者的模糊轮廓。",

	"The mightiest of the golems, the iron golem is a massive, towering giant wrought of heavy metal. An iron golem's shape can be worked into any form, though most are fashioned to look like giant suits of armor. Its fist can destroy creatures with a single blow, and its clanging steps shake the earth beneath its feet. Iron golems wield enormous blades to extend their reach, and all can belch clouds of deadly poison.": "铁甲虫是最强大的甲虫，是一个由重金属锻造的巨大的、高耸的巨人。铁甲虫的形状可以被加工成任何形式，尽管大多数都被塑造成巨型盔甲的样子。它的拳头可以一击摧毁生物，它铿锵有力的脚步震动着脚下的大地。铁甲虫挥舞着巨大的刀片来扩大它们的范围，而且都能喷出致命的毒云。",
	"An iron golem's body is smelted with rare tinctures and admixtures. Though other golems bear weaknesses inherent in their materials or the power of the elemental spirit bound within them, iron golems were designed to be nearly invulnerable. Their iron bodies imprison the spirits that drive them, and are susceptible only to weapons imbued with magic or the strength of adamantine.": "铁甲虫的身体是用稀有的酊剂和混合物冶炼而成。虽然其他巨魔在材料上有固有的弱点，或被束缚在其中的元素精神的力量，但铁巨魔被设计成几乎无懈可击。它们的铁质躯体禁锢着驱动它们的精神，只对注入了魔法或金刚砂力量的武器产生影响。",

	"A jackalwere has three physical forms that it shifts between. In its true form, it is indistinguishable from a normal jackal. It can take human form, often appearing gaunt and affecting a wretched demeanor to beg goodwill from strangers. When travelers welcome a jackalwere into their midst, the monster adopts its human-sized hybrid form, with the fur and head of a jackal but standing on two legs as it attacks.": "豺狼人有三种物理形态，它们在不同的形态之间转换。在它的真实形态中，它与普通的豺狼人没有区别。它可以变成人形，常常显得很憔悴，并影响到一种可怜的举止，以乞求陌生人的善意。当旅行者欢迎豺狼人进入他们中间时，这种怪物就会采用人类大小的混合形态，拥有豺狼人的皮毛和头部，但在攻击时用两条腿站立。",
	"The demon lord Graz'zt created jackalweres to serve his devoted servants, the lamias. Reaching out from the Abyss, he bestowed jackals with the gift of speech and the ability to assume humanoid forms. A jackalwere is born to lie, and perceptive creatures might notice it wincing in pain when it speaks the truth.": "恶魔领主Graz'zt创造了豺狼人，为他忠实的仆人--拉米亚人服务。他从深渊中伸出手来，赋予豺狼人说话的天赋和变成人形的能力。豺狼人生来就会撒谎，敏锐的生物可能会注意到它在说真话时痛苦地抽泣。",
	"A jackalwere prefers to fight alongside jackals and others of its kind. Under the direction of jackalweres, jackals are fierce and loyal companions.": "豺狼人更喜欢与豺狼人和其他同类一起战斗。在豺狼人的指挥下，豺狼人是凶猛而忠诚的伙伴。",

	"Kenku wear ill-fitting cloaks, robes, and rags. These garments cover the soft, sleek feathers of their bodies, shrouding their bare arms and legs. They tread lightly when they walk, on talons made for grasping the branches of trees and seizing prey from the lofty skies. Soft as the wind they move, so as not to draw attention to their shameful forms.": "肯库穿着不合身的斗篷、长袍和破布。这些衣服覆盖了他们身体上柔软光滑的羽毛，遮住了他们赤裸的胳膊和腿。他们走路时脚步轻盈，用爪子抓着树枝，从高空中抓取猎物。它们的动作像风一样柔和，以免引起人们对它们可耻的形式的注意。",
	"Once, the kenku held the wind in their wings, embracing the gusty sky and singing the sweet language of birdsong. Serving a master whose identity is now lost to their memory, the kenku coveted the glittering baubles of his household, and longed to speak so that they could cajole and swindle others out of such treasures. Stealing the secret of speech from a volume in their master's library, they disguised themselves in rags to beg for pretty things. When their master learned of their greed, he stripped away their wings as punishment, forcing them to beg forever.": "曾经，Kenku用他们的翅膀抓住了风，拥抱着狂风大作的天空，唱着鸟鸣的甜美语言。他们为一个主人服务，而这个主人的身份现在已经不为他们所记得了，Kenku觊觎他家闪闪发光的饰品，并渴望说话，以便他们能够劝说和诈骗他人的这些宝物。他们从主人的图书馆里偷出了说话的秘密，伪装成衣衫褴褛的人去乞讨漂亮的东西。当他们的主人知道他们的贪婪时，他剥夺了他们的翅膀作为惩罚，迫使他们永远乞讨。",
	" Kenku can mimic the sound of anything they hear. A kenku asking for money might make the sound of coins clinking together, and a kenku referring to a busy marketplace can reproduce the cacophony of hawking vendors, barking dogs, bleating sheep, and the cries of street urchins. When mimicking voices, they can only repeat words and phrases they have heard, not create new sentences. To converse with a kenku is to witness a performance of imitated sounds and almost nonsensical verse.": " Kenku可以模仿他们听到的任何声音。一个肯库要钱的人可能会发出硬币碰撞的声音，一个肯库指的是繁忙的市场，可以重现小贩、狗叫、羊叫和街头流浪汉的哭声。在模仿声音时，他们只能重复他们听到的单词和短语，不能创造新的句子。与肯库人交谈，就是目睹一场模仿声音和几乎无意义的诗句的表演。",
	"Kenku speak to one another in much the same way. Because they are adept at interpreting one another's glances and gestures, the sounds they make to communicate complex ideas or emotions can be succinct. Groups of kenku also develop secret codes. For example, a cat's meow might be the secret code for \"Prepare to attack!\" or \"Flee for your lives!\" Their talent for mimicry extends to handwriting, and criminal organizations often employ kenku to forge documents. When a kenku commits a crime, it might forge evidence to implicate another creature.": "KENKU以大致相同的方式彼此交谈。由于他们善于解读彼此的眼神和手势，他们发出的声音可以简洁地传达复杂的想法或情绪。kenku群体还发展出秘密代码。例如，猫的叫声可能是 \"准备进攻！\"或 \"逃命！\"的秘密代码。他们的模仿才能延伸到了笔迹，犯罪组织经常雇用肯库来伪造文件。当肯库犯罪时，它可能会伪造证据来牵连其他生物。",
	"All kenku pine for the ability to fly, and thus the punishments they mete out to one another often involve false wings, such as heavy wings of wood borne as a mark of shame. As a final, tragic reminder of the wings they once had, kenku carry out executions by hurling their condemned from tall buildings or cliffs.": "所有肯库人都渴望有飞翔的能力，因此他们对彼此的惩罚往往涉及到假的翅膀，如作为耻辱标志的沉重木翼。作为对他们曾经拥有的翅膀的最后一次悲剧性提醒，肯库人通过将他们的死刑犯从高楼或悬崖上扔下来执行死刑。",
	"Knights are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious orders, and noble causes. A knight's alignment determines the extent to which a pledge is honored. Whether undertaking a quest or patrolling a realm, a knight often travels with an entourage that includes squires and hirelings who are commoners.": "骑士是承诺为统治者、宗教团体和崇高事业服务的战士。骑士的结盟决定了誓言的兑现程度。无论是执行任务还是巡视王国，骑士通常都会带着一个随从，包括平民的侍从和雇工。",
	"Kobolds are craven reptilian humanoids that worship evil dragons as demigods and serve them as minions and toadies. Kobolds inhabit dragons' lairs when they can but more commonly infest dungeons, gathering treasures and trinkets to add to their own tiny hoards.": "哥布林是懦弱的爬行动物，他们把邪恶的龙当作半神来崇拜，并作为爪牙和奴仆为他们服务。哥布林在可能的情况下居住在龙的巢穴中，但更常见的是在地下城中出没，收集宝物和饰品，以增加他们自己的小小囤积。",
	" Kobolds are egg-laying creatures. They mature quickly and can live to be \"great wyrms\" more than a century old. However, many kobolds perish before they reach the end of their first decade. Physically weak, they are easy prey for predators. This vulnerability forces them to band together. Their superior numbers can win battles against powerful adversaries, but often with massive casualties on the kobold side.": " 哥布林是一种产蛋的生物。它们成熟得很快，可以活到一百多岁，成为 \"大巫\"。然而，许多哥布林在到达第一个十年结束之前就已经死亡。他们身体虚弱，很容易成为掠食者的猎物。这种弱点迫使他们联合起来。他们的数量优势可以赢得与强大对手的战斗，但哥布林一方往往会有大量的伤亡。",
	"Kobolds make up for their physical ineptitude with a cleverness for trap making and tunneling. Their lairs consist of low tunnels through which they move easily but which hinder larger humanoids. Kobolds also riddle their lairs with traps. The most insidious kobold traps make use of natural hazards and other creatures. A trip wire might connect to a spring-loaded trap that hurls clay pots of flesh-eating green slime or flings crates of venomous giant centipedes at intruders.": "哥布林以其制造陷阱和挖掘隧道的聪明才智来弥补其身体的无能。他们的巢穴由低矮的隧道组成，他们可以很容易地通过这些隧道，但却阻碍了大型人类的行动。哥布林还在其巢穴中布满了陷阱。最阴险的哥布林陷阱利用了自然界的危险和其他生物。一根绊马索可能会连接到一个装有弹簧的陷阱上，这个陷阱会向入侵者投掷食肉的绿色粘液粘土罐，或者将一箱箱有毒的巨型蜈蚣抛向入侵者。",
	"In addition to the dragons they revere, kobolds worship a lesser god named Kurtulmak. Legends speak of how Kurtulmak served as Tiamat's vassal in the Nine Hells until Garl Glittergold, the god of gnomes, stole a trinket from the Dragon Queen's hoard. Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the trinket, but Garl Glittergold played a trick on him, collapsing the earth and trapping the kobold god in an underground maze for eternity. For this reason, kobolds hate gnomes and pranks of any kind. Kurtulmak's most devoted worshipers dedicate themselves to finding and releasing their lost god from his prison-maze.": "除了他们所崇敬的龙之外，哥布林还崇拜一个名叫库图尔马克的较小的神。传说中，库图尔马克在九层地狱担任提亚马特的附庸，直到地精之神加尔-闪金从龙后的囤积物中偷走了一个饰品。提亚玛特派库图尔马克去取回饰品，但加尔-闪金耍了个花招，使大地塌陷，将哥布林神困在地下迷宫中，直到永远。由于这个原因，哥布林讨厌地精和任何形式的恶作剧。库图尔马克最忠实的崇拜者致力于寻找并将他们失去的神从迷宫中释放出来。",
	"Beneath the waves, the kraken sleeps for untold ages, awaiting some fell sign or calling. Land-born mortals who sail the open sea forget the reasons their ancestors dreaded the ocean, even as the races of the deep ignore strange gaps in their histories when their civilizations nearly vanished after the appearance of the tentacled horror.": "在海浪之下，克拉肯沉睡了不知多少年，等待着某种陨落的迹象或召唤。在公海上航行的陆生凡人忘记了他们的祖先害怕海洋的原因，甚至深海的种族也忽略了他们历史上的奇怪空白，他们的文明在触手可及的恐怖出现后几乎消失了。",
	"At the beginning of time, krakens served as fierce warriors of the gods. When the gods' wars ended, the krakens shrugged free of their servitude, never again to be bound by other beings. Whole nations quake in fear when the kraken emerges from its dark demesne, and even in the middle of the deepest oceans, storms rise or abate according to its will. The kraken is a primeval force that obliterates the greatest achievements of civilization as if they were castles in the sand. Its devastating attacks can destroy ocean trade and halt communication between coastal cities.": "在时间之初，克拉肯人充当了诸神的凶猛战士。当诸神的战争结束时，克拉肯摆脱了他们的奴役，再也不受其他生物的约束。当克拉肯从它的黑暗世界中出现时，整个国家都会因恐惧而颤抖，即使在最深的海洋中，风暴也会根据它的意志而上升或减弱。海怪是一种原始的力量，它使最伟大的文明成就湮灭，仿佛它们是沙中的城堡。它毁灭性的攻击可以破坏海洋贸易，并使沿海城市之间的通信中断。",
	"An ominous darkness presages a kraken's attack, and a cloud of inky poison colors the water around it. Galleons and warships vanish when its tentacles uncoil from the deep, the kraken breaking their masts like kindling before drawing down ships and crew. Not even landlocked surface dwellers are safe from a kraken's wrath. Krakens can breathe air as easily as water, and some crawl up rivers to nest in freshwater lakes, destroying cities and towns along the way. Adventurers tell of these monsters lairing in the ruins of lakeside citadels, their tentacles twined around leaning towers of disintegrating stone.": "不祥的黑暗预示着海怪的攻击，一团团墨色的毒液染红了它周围的水。大帆船和军舰在它的触手从深海中展开时消失了，海怪像火柴一样折断了它们的桅杆，然后把船和船员拉下来。即使是内陆的海面居民也不能幸免于海怪的怒火。海怪可以像水一样轻松地呼吸空气，有些海怪沿着河流爬到淡水湖里筑巢，沿途摧毁城市和城镇。冒险家们说，这些怪物在湖边城堡的废墟中筑巢，它们的触角缠绕着由瓦解的石头组成的倾斜的塔。",
	"Some krakens are virtual gods, with cults and minions spread across sea and land. Others are allied with Olhydra, the evil Princess of Elemental Water, and use her cultists to enforce their will on land and sea. A kraken pleased with its worshipers can becalm rough seas and bring a bounteous harvest of fish to the faithful. However, the devious mind of a kraken is ancient beyond reckoning, and is ultimately bent to the ruination of all things.": "一些克拉肯人是虚拟的神，他们的崇拜者和奴仆遍布海洋和陆地。另一些则与邪恶的水元素公主奥海德拉（Olhydra）结盟，并利用她的崇拜者在陆地和海洋上强制执行他们的意志。对其崇拜者感到满意的海怪可以平息波涛汹涌的海面，为信徒带来丰厚的鱼获。然而，海怪狡猾的头脑是无法估量的，它最终将毁灭所有的东西。",

	"One of the most revered gods of the kuo-toa is Blibdoolpoolp the Sea Mother, who takes the form of a female human with a crayfish head, a crayfish's claws, and an articulated shell covering her shoulders. Blibdoolpoolp was likely invented by a kuo-toa that improved on a broken human statue by adding the limbs and head of a crustacean. In sudden awe of its handiwork, it then named the resulting form a god.": "Kuo-toa人最崇敬的神之一是海母Blibdoolpoolp，她的形态是一个长着小龙虾头、小龙虾的爪子和覆盖在她肩膀上的铰接式外壳的女性人类。Blibdoolpoolp可能是由一个Kuo-toa发明的，它在一个破碎的人类雕像上增加了甲壳类动物的四肢和头部，从而改进了它。它对自己的手艺突然产生了敬畏之情，然后将所产生的形态命名为神。",

	"Kuo-toa archpriests are surrounded by fanatical devotees of their faith. The archpriest of a kuo-toa domain demands that all its subjects worship a specific god. An archpriest's mad belief in its god is so fervent that it manifests the powers of a high cleric. The archpriest can also bestow spells to devout underlings called whips. One or more of these whips are also the archpriest's children, and their primary role in kuo-toan society is to fight to the death to claim the throne when the archpriest dies.

A phylactery is traditionally an amulet in the shape of a small box, but it can take the form of any item possessing an interior space into which arcane sigils of naming, binding, immortality, and dark magic are scribed in silver.": "巫师是由一个神秘的仪式创造出来的，这个仪式将巫师的灵魂困在一个法器里。这样做可以将灵魂束缚在凡间，防止其在死后前往外星世界。传统上，法器是一个小盒子形状的护身符，但它也可以采取任何拥有内部空间的物品的形式，在里面用银色刻上命名、束缚、不朽和黑暗魔法的奥术符号。",
	"With its phylactery prepared, the future lich drinks a potion of transformation-a vile concoction of poison mixed with the blood of a sentient creature whose soul is sacrificed to the phylactery. The wizard falls dead, then rises as a lich as its soul is drawn into the phylactery, where it forever remains.": "在准备好法器后，未来的巫师喝下了变身药水--一种混合了有生命的生物的血液的卑劣毒药，这些生物的灵魂被献给了法器。巫师死了，然后在灵魂被吸入法器的过程中复活为一个巫师，并永远留在那里。",
	"A lich that fails or forgets to maintain its body with sacrificed souls begins to physically fall apart, and might eventually become a demilich.": "失败或忘记用牺牲的灵魂维持身体的巫师开始身体崩溃，并可能最终成为一个半巫师。",
	"When a lich's body is broken by accident or assault, the will and mind of the lich drains from it, leaving only a lifeless corpse behind. Within days, a new body reforms next to the lich's phylactery, coalescing out of glowing smoke that issues from the device. Because the destruction of its phylactery means the possibility of eternal death, a lich usually keeps its phylactery in a hidden, well-guarded location.": "当一个巫师的身体被意外或攻击打破时，巫师的意志和思想就会被抽走，只留下一具没有生命的尸体。几天之内，一个新的身体就会在巫师的法器旁边形成，从法器里发出的发光的烟雾中凝聚出来。由于法器的毁坏意味着永恒的死亡，巫师通常会把法器放在一个隐蔽的、守卫严密的地方。",
	"Destroying a lich's phylactery is no easy task and often requires a special ritual, item, or weapon. Every phylactery is unique, and discovering the key to its destruction can be a quest in and of itself.": "摧毁一个巫师的法器不是一件容易的事，通常需要一个特殊的仪式、物品或武器。每个法器都是独一无二的，而发现摧毁法器的关键本身就是一个任务。",
	"From time to time, a lich might be stirred from its single-minded pursuit of power to take an interest in the world around it, most often when some great event reminds it of the life it once led. It otherwise lives in isolation, engaging only with those creatures whose service helps secure its lair.": "巫师可能会不时地从对力量的一心追求中被唤醒，对周围的世界产生兴趣，最常见的是当一些伟大的事件让它想起曾经的生活。除此之外，它还与世隔绝，只与那些有助于保护其巢穴的生物打交道。",
	"Few liches call themselves by their former names, instead adopting monikers such as the Black Hand or the Forgotten King.": "很少有地衣人用他们以前的名字称呼自己，而是采用黑手或被遗忘的国王这样的称呼。",
	"Liches collect spells and magic items. In addition to its spell repertoire, a lich has ready access to potions, scrolls, libraries of spellbooks, one or more wands, and perhaps a staff or two. It has no qualms about putting these treasures to use whenever its lair comes under attack.": "巫师收集法术和魔法物品。除了它的法术剧目之外，一个蜥蜴人还可以随时获得药水、卷轴、法术书库、一根或多根魔杖，也许还有一两根魔杖。每当它的巢穴受到攻击时，它都会毫不犹豫地将这些宝物投入使用。",
	"A lich doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "巫师不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"A lich often haunts the abode it favored in life, such as a lonely tower, a haunted ruin, or an academy of black magic. Alternatively, some liches construct secret tombs filled with powerful guardians and traps. Everything about a lich's lair reflects its keen mind and wicked cunning, including the magic and mundane traps that secure it. Undead, constructs, and bound demons lurk in shadowy recesses, emerging to destroy those who dare to disturb the lich's work.": "巫师经常在它生前喜欢的地方出没，比如一座孤独的塔，一个闹鬼的废墟，或者一所黑魔法学院。另外，有些巫师会建造秘密的坟墓，里面有强大的守护者和陷阱。巫师巢穴的一切都反映了它敏锐的头脑和邪恶的狡猾，包括保护它的魔法和世俗的陷阱。亡灵、构筑物和被束缚的恶魔潜伏在阴暗的角落里，出现后会摧毁那些敢于打扰巫师工作的人。",
	"A lich encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 22 (41,000 XP).": "在巫师巢穴中遇到的巫师，其挑战等级为22（41,000XP）。",
	"Lizardfolk are primitive reptilian humanoids that lurk in the swamps and jungles of the world. Their hut villages thrive in forbidding grottos, half-sunken ruins, and watery caverns.": "蜥蜴人是原始的爬行动物，潜伏在世界的沼泽和丛林中。他们的小屋村落在令人望而却步的洞穴、半沉的废墟和水中的洞穴中繁衍。",
	"Lizardfolk deal and trade with other races only rarely. Fiercely territorial, they use camouflaged scouts to guard the perimeter of their domain. When unwelcome visitors are detected, a tribe sends a hunting band to harass or drive the trespassers off, or tricks them into blundering into the lairs of crocodiles and other dangerous creatures.": "蜥蜴人很少与其他种族进行交易和贸易。蜥蜴人的领地性很强，他们使用伪装的侦察兵来守卫他们领地的周边。当发现不受欢迎的访客时，一个部落会派出一支狩猎队来骚扰或赶走入侵者，或者诱使他们误入鳄鱼和其他危险生物的巢穴。",
	"Lizardfolk have no notion of traditional morality, and they find the concepts of good and evil utterly alien. Truly neutral creatures, they kill when it is expedient and do whatever it takes to survive.": "蜥蜴人没有传统的道德观念，他们发现善与恶的概念完全陌生。他们是真正的中立生物，在权宜之计下杀人，为了生存不择手段。",
	"Lizardfolk rarely stray beyond their claimed hunting grounds. Any creature that enters their territory is fair game to be stalked, killed, and devoured. They make no distinction between humanoids, beasts, and monsters. Similarly, lizardfolk don't like reaching too far beyond their borders, where they could easily become the hunted instead of the hunters.": "蜥蜴人很少离开他们声称的狩猎地。任何进入他们领地的生物都是被跟踪、杀害和吞噬的公平游戏。他们对人类、野兽和怪兽不加区分。同样地，蜥蜴人也不喜欢超出他们的边界，因为他们很容易成为被猎杀者而不是猎人。",
	"Occasions might arise when lizardfolk will form alliances with their neighbors. These lizardfolk usually learn firsthand that humans, dwarves, halflings, and elves can sometimes prove helpful or trustworthy. Once lizardfolk forge ties with outsiders, they are steadfast and fierce allies.": "有的时候，蜥蜴人会和他们的邻居结成联盟。这些蜥蜴人通常会亲身体会到，人类、矮人、半身人和精灵有时会被证明是有帮助或值得信赖的。一旦蜥蜴人与外来者建立了联系，他们就是坚定而激烈的盟友。",
	"Lizardfolk are omnivorous, but they have a taste for humanoid flesh. Prisoners are often taken back to their camps to become the centerpieces of great feasts and rites involving dancing, storytelling, and ritual combat.": "蜥蜴人是杂食性动物，但他们对人的肉体很有兴趣。囚犯们经常被带回他们的营地，成为涉及舞蹈、讲故事和仪式性战斗的伟大盛宴和仪式的中心人物。",
	"Victims are either cooked and eaten by the tribe, or are sacrificed to Semuanya, the lizardfolk god.": "受害者要么被部落煮熟吃掉，要么被献给蜥蜴人的神Semuanya。",
	"Though they aren't skilled artisans, lizardfolk craft tools and ornamental jewelry out of the bones of their kills, and they use the hides and shells of dead monsters to create shields.": "虽然他们不是熟练的工匠，但蜥蜴人用杀戮的骨头制作工具和装饰性的珠宝，他们用死去的怪物的皮和壳来制作盾牌。",
	"Lizardfolk respect and fear magic with a religious awe. Lizardfolk shamans lead their tribes, overseeing rites and ceremonies performed to honor Semuanya. From time to time, however, a lizardfolk tribe produces a powerful figure touched not by Semuanya but by Sess'inek-a reptilian demon lord who seeks to corrupt and control the lizardfolk.": "蜥蜴人以一种宗教般的敬畏之心尊重和惧怕魔法。蜥蜴人的巫师领导他们的部落，监督为纪念塞穆尼亚而举行的仪式和典礼。然而，不时地，一个蜥蜴人部落会产生一个强大的人物，他不是被塞姆安亚而是被塞斯英克所触动--一个试图腐蚀和控制蜥蜴人的爬虫类恶魔领主。",
	"Lizardfolk born in Sess'inek's image are larger and more cunning than other lizardfolk, and are thoroughly evil. These lizard kings and queens dominate lizardfolk tribes, usurping a shaman's authority and inspiring uncharacteristic aggression among their subjects.": "以塞斯涅克的形象出生的蜥蜴人比其他蜥蜴人更大、更狡猾，而且是彻底的邪恶。这些蜥蜴人国王和王后主宰着蜥蜴人部落，篡夺萨满的权威，在他们的臣民中激发出非同寻常的侵略性。",
	"Lizardfolk speak Draconic, which they are thought to have learned from dragons in ancient times. A tribe that wanders into the territory of a dragon will offer it tribute to win its favor. An evil dragon might exploit lizardfolk for its own vile ends, turning them into raiders and plunderers.": "蜥蜴人说Draconic，他们被认为是在远古时代从龙那里学到的。闯入龙的领地的部落会向它进贡以赢得它的青睐。邪恶的龙可能会为了自己卑鄙的目的而利用蜥蜴人，把他们变成袭击者和掠夺者。",
	"One of the most ancient and feared of all curses, lycanthropy can transform the most civilized humanoid into a ravening beast. In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.": "作为所有诅咒中最古老和最令人恐惧的诅咒之一，狼人症可以将最文明的人形生物转变为一只贪婪的野兽。在其自然的人形形态下，被狼人症诅咒的生物看起来就像正常的自己。然而，随着时间的推移，许多狼人获得了暗示其动物形态的特征。在这种动物形态下，狼人就像一个强大的正常动物版本。仔细观察，它的眼睛显示出一种微弱的非自然智慧的火花，并可能在黑暗中发出红色的光芒。",
	"Evil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good lycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far from villages and towns.": "邪恶的狼人隐藏在普通人中间，在夜间以动物的形态出现，散布恐怖和血腥，尤其是在满月的时候。好的狼人是隐居的，对其他文明的生物感到不舒服，经常独自生活在远离村庄和城镇的荒野地区。",
	"A humanoid creature can be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope, or if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes. A {@spell remove curse} spell can rid an afflicted lycanthrope of the curse, but a natural born lycanthrope can be freed of the curse only with a wish.": "一个人形生物在被狼人受伤后，或者如果它的父母一方或双方是狼人，就会受到狼人的诅咒。一个{@spell remove curse}的法术可以使受折磨的狼人摆脱诅咒，但天生的狼人只有通过愿望才能摆脱诅咒。",
	"A lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form-or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.": "狼人可以抵制它的诅咒，也可以接受它。通过抵抗诅咒，狼人在变成人形的时候会保留其正常的排列和个性。它像往常一样生活，将内心深处的兽性冲动埋藏起来。然而，当满月升起时，诅咒变得过于强烈，无法抵御，将个体转化为野兽形态--或者转化为一种结合了动物和人形特征的可怕的混合形态。当月亮减弱时，体内的野兽可以再次被控制。特别是如果被诅咒的生物没有意识到它的状况，它可能不记得它转变的事件，尽管这些记忆常常以血腥的梦境困扰着狼人。",
	"Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.": "有些人认为与诅咒作斗争没有什么意义，并接受他们的身份。随着时间的推移和经验的积累，他们学会了掌握自己的变身能力，并能随意变成野兽或混合体的形态。大多数接受兽性的狼人都会屈服于嗜血的欲望，成为邪恶的、捕食弱者的机会主义生物。",
	"A character who becomes a lycanthrope retains his or her statistics except as specified by lycanthrope type. The character gains the lycanthrope's speeds in non-humanoid form, damage immunities, traits, and actions that don't involve equipment.

The DM is free to decide that a change in alignment places the character under DM control until the curse of lycanthropy is removed.": "一个非狼人族的人被带有狼人族诅咒的攻击击中后，必须成功地进行宪法救赎（DC 8 + 狼人族的熟练度加成 + 狼人族的宪法修改器），否则将被诅咒。如果该角色接受了诅咒，他或她的排列方式就变成了为狼人定义的排列方式。DM可以自由地决定，在狼人的诅咒被解除之前，对准的改变会将角色置于DM的控制之下。",

	"Magmins are fire elemental spirits bound into physical forms by magic, and they appear in the Material Plane only when summoned. They view flammable objects as kindling for a grand conflagration, and only the magical control exerted by their summoners keeps them from setting everything they touch ablaze.

They lurk in quiet exile among the tumbled ruins of their former lives, surrounded by the petrified remains of past admirers and would-be heroes.": "蛇发美杜莎人既致命又迷人，他们因虚荣心而受到不朽的诅咒。他们潜伏在他们以前生活的废墟中，周围是过去的崇拜者和未来的英雄们的石化遗体，安静地流亡。",
	"Men and women who desire eternal youth, beauty, and adoration might pray to malicious gods, beg dragons for ancient magic, or seek out powerful archmages to fulfill their wishes. Others make sacrifices to demon lords or archdevils, offering all in exchange for this gift, oblivious to the curse that accompanies it. Those who strike such bargains gain physical beauty, restored youth, immortality, and the adoration of all who behold them, granting them the influence and power they so desire. However, after years of the living like a demigod among mortals, the price for their vanity and hubris is exacted, and they are forever transformed into medusas. A medusa's hair turns into a nest of venomous serpents, and all who gaze upon the medusa are {@condition petrified}, becoming stone monuments to its corruption.": "渴望永恒的青春、美丽和崇拜的男人和女人可能会向恶意的神灵祈祷，向龙乞求古老的魔法，或者寻找强大的大法师来实现他们的愿望。其他人则向恶魔领主或大恶魔献上祭品，用一切来换取这份礼物，对伴随而来的诅咒视而不见。那些达成这种交易的人获得了身体的美丽、恢复的青春、不朽，以及所有看到他们的人的崇拜，赋予他们他们所渴望的影响力和权力。然而，在像半神一样在凡人中生活多年后，他们的虚荣和狂妄的代价被索取了，他们永远变成了梅杜莎。美杜莎的头发会变成一窝毒蛇，所有注视着美杜莎的人都会{@condition petrified}，成为其腐败的石碑。",
	"Medusas live forever in seclusion, alienated from the world around them by their monstrous form and caprice. Their homes gradually fall into disrepair until they are little more than shadowy ruins covered with thorns and creepers, riddled with obstructions and hiding places. Foolhardy looters and adventurers who enter are often unaware of the medusa's presence until the creature is among them.": "美杜莎人永远生活在隐居之中，因其畸形的外形和任性而与周围的世界疏远。它们的家园逐渐年久失修，直到变成布满荆棘和爬山虎的阴暗废墟，到处都是障碍物和藏身之处。愚蠢的掠夺者和冒险者进入后往往不知道美杜莎的存在，直到该生物出现在他们中间。",
	"A medusa is subject to its own curse. By looking vainly on its reflection, it turns to stone as surely as any living mortal. As a result, a medusa destroys or removes any mirrors or reflective surfaces in its lair.": "梅杜莎受制于它自己的诅咒。徒劳地看着自己的倒影，它就会像任何活着的凡人一样变成石头。因此，冥王星会毁掉或移走其巢穴中的任何镜子或反射面。",
	"Mephits are capricious, imp-like creatures native to the elemental planes. They come in six varieties, each one representing the mixture of two elements.": "梅菲特是一种反复无常、类似小恶魔的生物，原产于元素界。它们有六个品种，每个品种代表两种元素的混合。",
	"Ageless tricksters, mephits gather in large numbers on the Elemental Planes and in the Elemental Chaos. They also find their way to the Material Plane, where they prefer to dwell in places where their base elements are abundant. For example, a magma mephit is composed of earth and fire, and it favors volcanic lairs, while an ice mephit, which is composed of air and water, favors frigid locales.": "不老的骗子，梅菲特大量聚集在元素界和元素混沌中。它们也会找到自己在物质世界的途径，它们更喜欢居住在它们的基本元素丰富的地方。例如，岩浆梅菲特是由土和火组成的，它喜欢火山巢穴，而冰梅菲特是由空气和水组成的，喜欢寒冷的地方。",

	"Merfolk lack the materials and practical means to forge weapons beneath the waves, to write books and keep lore, or to shape stone to raise buildings and cities. As a result, most live in small hunter-gatherer tribes, each of which holds unique values and creeds. Only occasionally do merfolk unite under the rule of a single leader. They do so to face a common threat or to complete a conquest. Such unifications can be the beginning of undersea kingdoms with dynasties lasting hundreds of years.": "人鱼族缺乏材料和实际手段，无法在海面下锻造武器，无法写书和保存传说，也无法塑造石头来建造建筑和城市。因此，大多数人生活在小型狩猎-采集部落中，每个部落都有独特的价值观和信条。只有偶尔，人鱼族才会在一个领导者的统治下团结起来。他们这样做是为了面对一个共同的威胁或完成一次征服。这样的统一可能是海底王国的开始，其王朝持续数百年之久。",
	"Merfolk build their settlements in vast undersea caverns, mazes of coral, the ruins of sunken cities, or structures they carve from the rocky seabed. They live in water shallow enough that the passage of time can be marked by the gleam and fade of sunlight through the water. In the reefs and trenches near their settlements, merfolk harvest coral and farm the seabed, shepherding schools of fish as land-based farmers tend sheep. Only rarely do merfolk venture into the darkest depths of the ocean. In such depths and in their undersea caverns, merfolk rely on the light of bioluminescent flora and fauna, such as jellyfish, whose slow pulsing movements lend merfolk settlements an otherworldly aesthetic.": "人鱼族在巨大的海底洞穴、珊瑚迷宫、沉没的城市废墟或他们从岩石海床上凿出的结构中建造他们的定居点。他们生活在足够浅的水中，时间的流逝可以通过阳光在水中的闪耀和褪色来标记。在他们定居点附近的珊瑚礁和海沟里，人鱼族收获珊瑚并在海床上耕作，像陆地上的农民放羊一样牧养鱼群。人鱼族只有在很少的情况下才会冒险进入海洋的最黑暗深处。在这样的深处和他们的海底洞穴中，人鱼族依靠生物发光的动植物，如水母的光，其缓慢的脉动使人鱼族的定居点具有另一种美感。",

Everyone who touched the idol became afflicted with madness, including the king, who decreed that a sacrificial ritual be performed to open a gateway to the Abyss. The ocean turned red with the blood of slaughtered merfolk, but the ritual worked, and the king led the survivors through the underwater gate to Demogorgon's layer of the Abyss. The merfolk remained there for generations, fighting for their lives as the Abyss warped them completely, transforming them into hulking, evil monstrosities. Thus, the first merrow were born.": "他们不知道那是什么，就把神器带给了他们的国王。每一个接触过神像的人都变得疯狂，包括国王，他下令举行祭祀仪式以打开通往深渊的大门。海洋被被屠杀的人鱼的血染红了，但仪式成功了，国王带领幸存者穿过水下的大门，来到了德摩根的深渊层中。人鱼们在那里呆了好几代，在深渊完全扭曲他们的时候为自己的生命而战，把他们变成了巨大的、邪恶的怪物。因此，第一批人鱼诞生了。",

Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.": "金属龙和它们邪恶的铬族亲属一样觊觎宝藏，但它们在追求财富的过程中并没有那么多的贪婪驱动。相反，金属龙被驱使着去调查和收集，拿走无人认领的遗物并将它们储存在自己的巢穴中。金属龙的宝藏中充满了反映其个性的物品，讲述其历史，并保存其记忆。金属龙还寻求保护其他生物免受危险的魔法伤害。因此，强大的魔法物品甚至是邪恶的神器有时也会被藏在金属龙的宝库里。",
	"A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good.

	"Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.": "金属龙有很长的记忆，它们根据以前与相关人种的接触形成对人种的看法。好的龙可以通过嗅觉识别人形血统，嗅出它们遇到的每个人，并记住它们多年来接触过的任何亲属。一条金龙可能永远不会怀疑一个狡猾的恶棍的两面性，假设这个恶棍与一个善良的、有德行的祖母有着同样的思想和心态。另一方面，龙可能会憎恨一个高贵的圣骑士，他的祖先在三个世纪前从龙的囤积物中偷走了一个银质雕像。",

	"Mind flayers, also called illithids, are the scourge of sentient creatures across countless worlds.

	"In eons past, illithids controlled empires that spanned many worlds.

	"Solitary mind flayers are likely rogues and outcasts. Most illithids belong to a colony of sibling mind flayers devoted to an elder brain-a massive brain-like being that resides in a briny pool near the center of a mind flayer community.

	"On the rare occasion that mind flayers need to write something down, they do so in Qualith. This system of tactile writing (similar to braille) is read by an illithid's tentacles. Qualith is written in four-line stanzas and is so alien in construction that non-illithids must resort to magic to discern its meaning. Though Qualith can be used to keep records, illithids most often use it to mark portals or other surfaces with warnings or instructions.": "在极少的情况下，如果心灵传播者需要写下一些东西，他们就会用Qualith来做。这种触觉书写系统（类似于盲文）可以通过illithid的触手来阅读。Qualith是用四行诗句写成的，其结构非常奇怪，非illithids必须借助魔法才能辨别其含义。虽然Qualith可以用来保存记录，但illithids最常使用它来标记门户或其他表面的警告或指示。",

	"Once deceased, an individual has no say in whether or not its body is made into a mummy. Some mummies were powerful individuals who displeased a high priest or pharaoh, or who committed crimes of treason, adultery, or murder.

Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields.

They prey on creatures living or wandering in the vales below, and travelers on lonely mountain roads learn to keep a wary eye on the sky. Because normal weapons are less effective against perytons, the folk of the mountains know to avoid confrontations with these monsters at all costs.": "Perytons在山脊上栖息，在高高的山洞里筑巢。它们捕食生活或游荡在下面山谷中的生物，在孤独的山路上的旅行者要学会警惕地注视着天空。由于普通武器对perytons不太有效，山区的居民知道要不惜一切代价避免与这些怪物发生冲突。",
	"Established settlements are attractive to perytons as a renewable food source. As such, village councils and local nobles often hire adventurers to eliminate peryton nests.": "已建成的定居点作为可再生的食物来源，对perytons很有吸引力。因此，村委会和当地贵族经常雇用冒险家来消除peryton的巢穴。",

Its movement on the Ethereal Plane before coming back to the Material Plane makes it seem like it can teleport.": "相位蜘蛛拥有神奇的能力，可以在虚空界中相位，也可以离开虚空界。它似乎凭空出现，并在攻击后迅速消失。它在回到物质界之前在虚空界的移动使它看起来像是能传送。",

	"A piercer is the larval form of a roper, and the two creatures often attack in tandem. A rock-like shell encases a piercer's body, giving it the look and texture of a stalactite. That shell protects a soft, slug-like upper body that lets the piercer move across cavern walls and ceilings to position itself for prey. With its eye and mouth closed, the piercer is difficult to distinguish from ordinary rock formations.": "穿刺者是罗珀的幼虫形式，这两种生物经常串联攻击。一个岩石般的外壳包裹着穿孔者的身体，使其具有钟乳石的外观和纹理。这个壳保护着柔软的、像蛞蝓一样的上半身，使穿孔者可以在洞穴的墙壁和天花板上移动，以确定自己对猎物的位置。当它的眼睛和嘴闭上时，穿孔者很难从普通的岩层中分辨出来。",
	"Piercers can see, but they can also respond to noise and heat, waiting for living creatures to pass beneath them, then falling to attack. A piercer that misses its chance to kill must make its slow way back to the ceiling. A fallen piercer excretes a foul-smelling slime when attacked, making most predators think twice about eating it.": "穿刺者可以看到，但它们也可以对噪音和热量做出反应，等待生物从它们下面经过，然后落下攻击。错过杀人机会的穿刺者必须缓慢地回到天花板上。坠落的穿刺者在受到攻击时，会排出一种恶臭的粘液，使大多数掠食者在吃它时三思而行。",

After a piercer successfully slays a creature, the others slowly creep toward the corpse to join in the feast.": "穿刺者聚集在一起，以最大限度地提高他们的攻击效果，同时落下，以增加打击猎物的几率。当一个穿刺者成功地杀死一个生物后，其他的穿刺者会慢慢地爬向尸体，加入这场盛宴。",

These domineering and manipulative tyrants conspire to eliminate anything that stands between them and their desires, even as they negotiate the convoluted and dangerous politics of the Nine Hells.": "带着膨胀的优越感和权利，坑魔在地狱界形成了一个怪异的贵族阶层。这些专横跋扈、善于操纵的暴君阴谋消灭任何阻挡他们实现愿望的东西，甚至在他们与九层地狱错综复杂的危险政治谈判时也是如此。",
	"A pit fiend is a hulking monster with a whip-like tail and enormous wings that it wraps around itself like a cloak.

	"Curious as cats and shy as deer, pixies go where they please. They like to spy on other creatures and can barely contain their excitement around them. The urge to introduce themselves and strike up a friendship is almost overwhelming; only a pixie's fear of being captured or attacked stays its hand. Those who wander through a pixie's glade might never see the creatures, yet hear the occasional giggle, gasp, or sigh.": "小精灵像猫一样好奇，像鹿一样害羞，喜欢去哪里就去哪里。它们喜欢窥视其他生物，在它们身边几乎无法抑制自己的兴奋。介绍自己和建立友谊的冲动几乎是压倒性的；只有小精灵对被抓或被攻击的恐惧才会阻止它的行动。那些在小精灵的树丛中徘徊的人可能永远不会看到这些生物，但却能听到偶尔的咯咯笑声、喘息声或叹息。",
	"Pixies array themselves like princes and princesses of the fey, wearing flowing gowns and doublets of silk that sparkle like moonlight on a pond.

	"With their innate power of invisibility, pixies rarely appear unless they wish to be seen.

They cause flowers to sparkle with summer dew, and color the leaves with the blazing hues of autumn.": "小精灵具有与生俱来的隐身能力，除非他们希望被看到，否则很少出现。在仙界和物质界，小精灵在冬天的池塘上刻下冰霜的图案，在春天唤醒花蕾。他们使花朵闪耀着夏日的露水，为树叶染上秋天的炽热色彩。",
	"When pixies fly visibly, a shower of sparkling dust follows in their wake like the glittering tail of a shooting star. A mere sprinkle of pixie dust is said to be able to grant the power of flight, confuse a creature hopelessly, or send foes into a magical slumber.": "当小精灵明显地飞行时，一阵阵闪亮的尘埃就像流星的闪亮的尾巴一样跟在他们后面。据说，仅仅洒下一粒精灵尘，就能赋予飞行的力量，使生物无望地迷惑，或使敌人进入神奇的沉睡。",

	"While the arrival of visitors piques their curiosity, pixies are too shy to reveal themselves at first. They study the visitors from afar to gauge their temperament or play harmless tricks on them to measure their reactions. For example, pixies might tie a dwarf's boots together, create illusions of strange creatures or treasures, or use dancing lights to lead interlopers astray. If the visitors respond with hostility, the pixies give them a wide berth. If the visitors are good natured, the pixies are likely to be emboldened and more friendly. The fey might even emerge and offer to guide their \"guests\" along a safe route or invite them to a tiny yet satisfying feast prepared in their honor.": "虽然游客的到来激发了他们的好奇心，但小精灵们一开始都很害羞，不敢表露自己。他们从远处研究来访者，以衡量他们的性情，或对他们玩无害的把戏，以衡量他们的反应。例如，小精灵可能会把矮人的靴子绑在一起，制造奇怪的生物或宝物的幻觉，或用跳舞的灯光把闯入者引入歧途。如果来访者的反应是敌对的，小精灵就会给他们一个宽阔的空间。如果来访者性情好，小精灵就可能胆子大起来，更加友好。小精灵们甚至可能出现，并提出引导他们的 \"客人 \"走一条安全的路线，或邀请他们参加为他们准备的微小但令人满意的盛宴。",
	"Unlike their fey cousins, the sprites, pixies abhor weapons and would sooner flee than get into a physical altercation with any enemy.": "与他们的精灵表亲不同，小精灵厌恶武器，宁愿逃跑也不愿与任何敌人发生肢体冲突。",
	"Planetars act as the weapons of the gods they serve, presenting a tangible representation of their deities' might.

A priest typically has one or more acolytes to help with religious ceremonies and other sacred duties.": "祭司将他们的神的教义带给普通人。他们是寺庙和神殿的精神领袖，通常在社区中拥有影响力。邪恶的祭司可能在暴君手下公开工作，也可能是隐藏在良好社会阴影下的宗教派别的领袖，监督堕落的仪式。牧师通常有一个或多个徒弟来帮助完成宗教仪式和其他神圣的职责。",

	"Mages often seek out pseudodragons, whose agreeable disposition, telepathic ability, and resistance to magic make them superior familiars.

	"These flying reptiles have wingspans of 15 to 20 feet and typically dive for small marine prey, though they are opportunists and will attack any creature that appears edible.

Precious metals and gems can thus be found within the bodies of purple worms, which are targeted by particularly brave and foolhardy treasure hunters.": "当紫色蠕虫钻入地面时，它消耗土和岩石，并将其分解和不断排泄出来。因此，贵重金属和宝石可以在紫色蠕虫的体内找到，特别勇敢和愚蠢的寻宝者会把它们作为目标。",
	"A burrowing purple worm constantly creates new tunnels throughout the Underdark, which are quickly made use of by other creatures as corridors and highways.

	"Quaggoths were never an enlightened species, but they were not always the brutal Underdark denizens they are today. In a distant age, quaggoth tribes dwelled upon the surface as nocturnal arboreal hunters, possessing their own language and culture. When elves appeared in the mortal realm, they clashed with the quaggoths, eventually driving them to near extinction. Only by fleeing deep into the Underdark did the quaggoths survive.": "夸父从来都不是一个开明的物种，但他们并不总是今天这样残酷的地下城居民。在一个遥远的时代，夸父部落作为夜间树栖猎人居住在地表，拥有自己的语言和文化。当精灵出现在凡间时，他们与食人魔发生冲突，最终将它们逼到了濒临灭绝的境地。只有逃到地下世界的深处，夸父才得以生存。",
	"As they passed the ages deep beneath the world, the quaggoths' fur lost its color and their vision adapted to the darkness, even as the constant danger and weird magic of their new realm transformed them.

As cannibalism became part of their culture, their past was abandoned.": "随着他们在世界地下深处的岁月流逝，树獭的皮毛失去了颜色，他们的视力也适应了黑暗，即使新领域的持续危险和怪异的魔法也改变了他们。他们变得越来越残忍和野蛮，他们吃任何他们能找到的食物--当他们找不到食物时，他们就互相捕食。随着吃人成为他们文化的一部分，他们的过去被抛弃了。",
	"The ancient enmity between quaggoths and surface elves makes them easy converts to the dark elf cause. In recent years, the drow have taken an interest in breeding quaggoths, encouraging their ferocity while strengthening their obedience. Wealthy drow houses have legions of quaggoths at their command. Even worse, the drow cultivate the quaggoths' hatred of the elves by leading them on surface raids against known elven enclaves.": "夸父和地表精灵之间古老的敌意使他们很容易皈依黑暗精灵的怀抱。近年来，鸦人对繁殖夸父的兴趣浓厚，鼓励它们的凶猛，同时加强它们的服从性。富裕的乌鸦家族拥有听从他们指挥的夸父军团。更糟糕的是，鸦人通过带领它们对已知的精灵飞地进行地面袭击，来培养奎格特人对精灵的仇恨。",

	"Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.": "红龙在被激怒时，会飞向破坏性的愤怒，并冲动行事。它们是如此的凶猛和复仇，以至于它们被许多文化认为是典型的恶龙。",
	"No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.": "没有其他龙能接近红龙的傲慢。这些生物视自己为国王和帝王，并视其他龙族为低等生物。红龙相信他们是被提亚马特选中，以她的名义进行统治，认为世界和其中的每一个生物都是他们可以指挥的。",
	"Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.": "红龙是激烈的领地主义和孤立主义。然而，它们渴望了解更广阔世界的事件，并利用较小的生物作为线人、信使和间谍。它们对其他红龙的消息最感兴趣，它们不断地与其他红龙争夺地位。",
	"When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.": "当它需要仆人时，红龙要求混乱的邪恶人类效忠。如果不效忠，它就会屠杀一个部落的首领，并要求对幸存者拥有领主地位。为红龙服务的生物一直生活在恐惧之中，害怕因为不高兴而被烤焦和吃掉。他们大部分时间都在向红龙献媚，试图保住性命。",
	"Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.": "红龙把财富看得比什么都重要，他们的财宝囤积起来是很传奇的。他们觊觎任何有金钱价值的东西，往往一眼就能判断出一个小玩意的价值在一个铜块之内。红龙对从它杀死的强大敌人那里夺取的财宝有一种特殊的感情，它们会展示这些财宝来证明自己的优越性。",
	"A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can't be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.": "红龙知道它囤积的每件物品的价值和来源，以及每件物品的确切位置。它可能会注意到一个硬币的缺失，从而点燃它的怒火，毫不留情地追踪并杀死盗贼。如果找不到小偷，巨龙就会大发雷霆，将城镇和村庄夷为平地，试图满足它的愤怒。",
	"Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in caverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps. With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls-and the wider world it seeks to control.": "红龙的巢穴在高山或丘陵上，居住在白雪皑皑的山峰下的洞穴里，或者在废弃的矿场和矮人据点的深山大厅里。有火山或地热活动的洞穴是最珍贵的红龙巢穴，它创造了阻碍入侵者的危险，让灼热和火山气体在龙睡觉时冲刷它。由于它的囤积物在巢穴深处得到很好的保护，红龙在山外的时间和在山里的时间一样多。对红龙来说，世界的巨大高度是它的宝座，它可以从那里眺望它所控制的一切，以及它试图控制的更广阔的世界。",
	"Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon's power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.": "在整个巢穴建筑群中，仆人们为龙的力量竖起了纪念碑，讲述它的生活、它所杀死的敌人和它所征服的国家的残酷故事。",
	"When a red slaad claws a humanoid creature, it can inject an egg from a gland under one of its claws. The egg works its way into its host and gestates, eventually forming a slaad tadpole. Such a tadpole then eats its way out of the host's body, feeds on the host's remains, and then seeks any other fresh meat it can find. The tadpole transforms into a fully grown blue slaad-or green slaad if the host had the ability to cast 3rd level spells or higher-within {@dice 2d12} hours.": "当红腹锦鲤抓住一个人形生物时，它可以从它的一个爪子下面的腺体注入一个卵。卵进入其宿主体内并进行孕育，最终形成一个蝌蚪。这样的蝌蚪会从宿主的身体里吃出来，以宿主的遗体为食，然后寻找它能找到的任何其他新鲜肉类。蝌蚪在{@dice 2d12}小时内变成一只完全长大的蓝色蝌蚪--或者绿色蝌蚪，如果宿主有能力施展三级以上的法术的话。",

	"Remorhazes live in arctic climes, preying on elk, polar bears, and other creatures sharing their territory. They can't tolerate warm weather, having adapted to the cold by generating a furnace-like heat within their bodies. When hunting, a remorhaz burrows deep below the snow and ice and lies in wait for the faint vibrations created by a creature moving above it. While hidden under the ice and snow, it can lower its body temperature so that it doesn't melt its cover.": "雷莫哈兹生活在北极地区，捕食麋鹿、北极熊和其他分享其领土的生物。它们不能忍受温暖的天气，通过在体内产生火炉般的热量来适应寒冷。狩猎时，雷莫哈兹深埋在冰雪之下，等待上方生物移动时产生的微弱振动。当隐藏在冰雪之下时，它可以降低自己的体温，以便不至于融化其覆盖物。",
	"Frost giant hunters scour the icy wastes for remorhaz nests and eggs. The giants prize young remorhazes, which can be trained from hatching to obey commands and guard the giants' icy citadels. Unlike fully grown specimens, young remorhazes gnaw on their victims instead of swallowing them whole.": "冰霜巨人猎人在冰冷的荒原上寻找雷莫哈兹的巢穴和蛋。巨人珍视幼小的雷莫哈兹，它们从孵化开始就可以接受训练，服从命令，守护巨人的冰雪堡垒。与完全成熟的标本不同，年轻的雷莫哈兹会啃食它们的受害者，而不是把它们整个吞下。",
	"A revenant forms from the soul of a mortal who met a cruel and undeserving fate. It claws its way back into the world to seek revenge against the one who wronged it. The revenant reclaims its mortal body and superficially resembles a zombie. However, instead of lifeless eyes, a revenant's eyes burn with resolve and flare in the presence of its adversary. If the revenant's original body was destroyed or is otherwise unavailable, the spirit of the revenant enters another humanoid corpse. Regardless of the body the revenant uses as a vessel, its adversary always recognizes the revenant for what it truly is.": "一个复仇者从一个遭遇残酷和不值得的命运的凡人的灵魂中形成。它张牙舞爪地回到这个世界上，寻找对它不利的人进行报复。复仇者重新获得其凡人的身体，表面上看与僵尸相似。然而，复仇者的眼睛不是毫无生气的，而是燃烧着决心，在其对手面前耀武扬威。如果复仇者原来的身体被摧毁或无法使用，复仇者的灵魂会进入另一具人形尸体。无论复仇者用什么身体作为容器，它的对手总是能认出复仇者的真面目。",
	"A revenant has only one year to exact revenge. When its adversary dies, or if the revenant fails to kill its adversary before its time runs out, it crumbles to dust and its soul fades into the afterlife. If its foe is too powerful for the revenant to destroy on its own, it seeks worthy allies to help it fulfill its quest.": "复仇者只有一年的时间来进行报复。当它的对手死亡时，或者如果复仇者未能在它的时间结束前杀死它的对手，它就会化为尘土，其灵魂消逝在来世。如果它的敌人过于强大，复仇者无法独自消灭，它就会寻找有价值的盟友来帮助它完成任务。",
	"No magic can hide a creature pursued by a revenant, which always knows the direction and distance between it and the target of its vengeance. In cases where the revenant seeks revenge against more than one adversary, it pursues them one at a time, starting with the creature that dealt it the killing blow. If the revenant's body is destroyed, its soul flies forth to seek out a new corpse in which to resume its hunt.": "任何魔法都无法掩盖被复仇者追捕的生物，复仇者总是知道它和它的复仇目标之间的方向和距离。如果复仇者要向一个以上的对手复仇，它会一次追击一个，从给它致命一击的生物开始。如果复仇者的身体被摧毁，它的灵魂就会飞去寻找一具新的尸体来继续它的狩猎。",
	"A revenant doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "复仇者不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"At first sight, a roc's silhouette looks much like any other bird of prey. As it descends, however, its unearthly size becomes terrifyingly clear. In flight, a roc's wingspan spreads two hundred feet or more. At rest, perched upon the mountain peaks that are its home, this monstrous bird rivals the oldest dragons in size.": "乍一看，大鹏鸟的轮廓看起来很像其他猎物的鸟。然而，随着它的下降，它那超凡脱俗的体型就变得非常可怕了。在飞行时，大鹏鸟的翼展可达两百英尺或更远。在休息时，栖息在作为其家园的山峰上，这种怪异的鸟在尺寸上可以与最古老的龙相媲美。",

	"Though cloud giants and storm giants sometimes tame these great birds, rocs treat even giants as potential prey. They fly great distances in search of food, soaring high above the clouds to reach their favored hunting grounds. A roc seldom hunts swift or small creatures, and it ignores towns and forests where prey can easily take cover. When it locates a large and slow-moving target such as a giant, a whale, or an elephant, a roc dives down to snatch its prey in its massive talons.": "虽然云中巨人和风暴巨人有时会驯服这些伟大的鸟类，但大鹏鸟甚至将巨人视为潜在的猎物。它们会飞到很远的地方去寻找食物，在云层上高高飞起，到达它们喜欢的狩猎场。鹏鸟很少猎杀敏捷或小型的生物，也不理会城镇和森林，因为那里的猎物很容易躲避。当它找到一个大的和缓慢移动的目标，如巨人、鲸鱼或大象时，大鹏鸟会俯冲下来，用它巨大的爪子抓取猎物。",
	"Rocs are solitary creatures that can live for centuries. They lair in nests made from trees, tents, broken ships, and the remains of caravans they carry off, placing these massive tangles in mountain clefts out of the reach of lesser creatures.": "大鹏鸟是孤独的生物，可以活上几个世纪。它们的巢穴由树木、帐篷、破船和它们运走的商队残骸组成，将这些巨大的缠结物放在山间的裂缝中，不让小生物触及。",
	"Sometimes a roc's nest contains treasures from the caravans or ships they raid, but these creatures are heedless of such baubles. More rarely, a nest holds eggs that are taller than a human, produced by the rocs' infrequent mating.": "有时，大鹏鸟的巢穴里有它们袭击的商队或船只上的宝物，但这些生物对这些小玩意毫不在意。更少见的是，窝里有比人还高的蛋，这是大鹏鸟不经常交配而产生的。",
	"Living in caves and caverns throughout the Underdark, voracious ropers feast on whatever they can catch and seize. A roper eats any creature, from Underdark beasts to adventurers and their gear.": "生活在整个暗黑世界的山洞和洞穴中，贪婪的绳索人以他们能捕捉到的任何东西为食。咆哮者吃任何生物，从地下城的野兽到冒险者和他们的装备。",
	"A roper has the appearance of a stalagmite or stalactite, which often allows it to attack with surprise. The creature can move slowly using thousands of sticky cilia beneath its base. It creeps up cave walls and along stone ceilings, finding the best position from which to attack.": "罗珀具有石笋或钟乳石的外观，这往往使它能够出其不意地进行攻击。这种生物可以利用其底部的数以千计的粘性纤毛缓慢移动。它沿着洞壁和石顶爬行，寻找最佳的攻击位置。",
	"The roper is an evolved, mature form of piercer, with which it shares its rock-like appearance and hunting tactics. A roper can hold still for long hours, shutting its single eye to look like nothing more than a mundane formation of rock. Creatures that come too close are surprised when that eye snaps open and sticky tendrils shoot out to seize them. The roper then makes horrible guttural sounds as it reels in its struggling victims, drawing them close for the fatal bite of its stony teeth.": "罗珀是一种进化的、成熟的穿山甲形式，它与穿山甲有着岩石般的外表和狩猎策略。罗珀可以长时间保持不动，闭上它的单眼，看起来就像一个平凡的岩石阵而已。靠近的生物会感到惊讶，因为它的眼睛会突然睁开，粘稠的卷须会射出，抓住它们。然后，罗珀发出可怕的咕咕声，它卷住挣扎的受害者，拉近他们的距离，让他们被它的石质牙齿咬死。",
	"A roper can digest anything it eats with the exception of platinum, gemstones, and magic items, which can sometimes be retrieved from the creature's gizzard after death. A roper's digestive juices are also valuable, fetching a high price from alchemists who use them as a solvent.": "除了铂金、宝石和魔法物品外，罗珀可以消化它所吃的任何东西，这些东西有时可以在死后从生物的胃里取出来。松鼠的消化液也很有价值，可以从将其作为溶剂的炼金术士那里获得高价。",
	"A roper has six nubs set along its body, through which it extrudes sticky tendrils that bond to whatever they touch. Each tendril sends out hair-like growths that penetrate a creature's flesh and sap its strength, so the victim can struggle only weakly as the roper reels it in. If a tendril is cut through or broken, the roper produces a new one to replace it.": "罗布泊沿着它的身体有六个小圆点，它通过这些小圆点挤出粘性卷须，与它们所接触到的东西结合在一起。每根卷须都会发出像头发一样的生长物，穿透生物的肉体并消耗其力量，因此受害者只能在绳索的缠绕下无力地挣扎。如果一根卷须被切开或折断，绳索者会产生一个新的卷须来代替它。",

	"In some cases, a rug of smothering is disguised as a carpet of flying or another beneficial magic item. However, a character who stands or sits on the rug, or who attempts to utter a word of command, is quickly trapped as the rug of smothering rolls itself tightly around its victim.": "在某些情况下，窒息之毯被伪装成飞毯或其他有益的魔法物品。然而，站在或坐在地毯上的人物，或者试图说出命令的人，很快就会被窒息之毯所困，因为窒息之毯会紧紧卷住它的受害者。",
	" An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.": " 一个有动画的物体不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。当一个物体的命中率下降到0时，使该物体有生命的魔法就会被驱散。一个被激活的物体降到了0点，就变成了无生命的，并且被破坏得太厉害，对任何人都没有什么用处或价值。",
	"Most dwarves would rather face a squad of orcs than confront a single rust monster. These strange, normally docile creatures corrode ferrous metals, then gobble up the rust they create. In doing so, they have ruined the armor, shields, and weapons of countless adventurers.": "大多数矮人宁愿面对一队兽人，也不愿面对一个铁锈怪物。这些奇怪的、通常温顺的生物会腐蚀黑色金属，然后吞食它们制造的铁锈。在这样做的时候，它们毁坏了无数冒险者的盔甲、盾牌和武器。",

	"Rust monsters roam subterranean passages in search of ferrous metals such as iron, steel, adamantine, and mithral to consume.": "锈迹斑斑的怪物在地下通道游荡，寻找铁、钢、金刚砂和密特拉等黑色金属进行吞噬。",
	"They ignore creatures not carrying such metals, but can become aggressive toward those bearing steel weapons and armor. A rust monster can smell its food at a distance, immediately dashing toward the scent's source to corrode and consume the object.": "它们无视没有携带这种金属的生物，但对携带钢制武器和盔甲的生物会变得很有攻击性。锈怪可以在远处闻到它的食物，立即冲向气味的源头，腐蚀并吞噬物体。",
	"A rust monster doesn't care if the rust it consumes comes from a spike or a sword. Adventurers can distract the creature by dropping ferrous objects behind them.": "锈怪并不关心它所消耗的铁锈是来自钉子还是剑。冒险者可以通过在他们身后投掷铁质物品来分散怪物的注意力。",
	"Rust monsters are rarely found in large numbers, preferring to hunt alone or in small groups. They meander along tunnels, moving from cave to cave in their tireless search for ferrous metals to consume. Their wanderings often bring them into contact with other Underdark denizens that find them harmless or unappetizing. Thus, rust monsters may be found in close proximity to other subterranean monsters. If they are well treated and well fed, they can also become friendly companions or pets.": "锈迹斑斑的怪物很少被大量发现，它们更喜欢单独或以小团体的形式进行狩猎。它们沿着隧道蜿蜒前行，从一个洞穴到另一个洞穴，不知疲倦地寻找可供食用的黑色金属。它们的游荡经常使它们与其他地下城居民接触，这些居民认为它们无害或不讨人喜欢。因此，铁锈怪可能会在靠近其他地下怪物的地方被发现。如果它们受到良好的对待和喂养，它们也可以成为友好的伙伴或宠物。",
	"Across fog-shrouded coasts or endless ocean swells, an ominous drone sounded on a conch shell chills the blood of all who hear it.

	"So intense is sahuagin hatred for the aquatic elves that the sea devils have adapted to combat their ancient foes. A sahuagin born near enough to an aquatic elf community can enter the world as a malenti-a sahuagin that physically resembles an aquatic elf in every way.

	"The sahuagin put the malenti to good use as spies and assassins in aquatic elf cities and the societies of other creatures that pose a threat to sahuagin.

Outside their home plane, they play among the burning skeletons of charred trees as forest fires rage around them, or slither down the slopes of erupting volcanoes to linger in fire pits and magma floes.": "蝾螈崇拜力量，它们喜欢放火烧东西。在它们的母体之外，当森林大火肆虐时，它们会在烧焦的树木骨架间玩耍，或者从喷发的火山坡上滑下，在火坑和岩浆漂浮物中逗留。",
	"Salamanders hatch from eggs that are two-foot-diameter spheres of smoldering obsidian.

	"This inherent heat is an asset to salamanders' skill as smiths, allowing them to soften and shape iron and steel with their bare hands.

Satyrs allow no festivity to pass them by. They partake in any holiday they've heard of. Civilizations of the world have enough festivals and holy days among them to justify nonstop celebration.": "萨提尔渴望喝最烈的酒，吃最香的香料，跳最令人眼花缭乱的舞蹈。当萨提尔不能放纵自己时，它就会感到饥饿，并不惜一切代价来满足自己的欲望。它可能会绑架一个优秀的吟游诗人来聆听动听的歌曲，偷偷穿过一个防御严密的花园来凝视一个美丽的小伙子或小姑娘，或者潜入一个宫殿来品尝这个国家最好的食物。萨提尔不允许任何节日与他们擦肩而过。他们参加任何他们听说过的节日。世界上的文明有足够的节日和圣日来证明不停地庆祝。",
	"Inebriated on drink and pleasure, satyrs give no thought to the consequences of the hedonism they incite in others. They leave such creatures mystified at their own behavior. Such revelers might have to scrounge for excuses to explain their disordered state to parents, employers, family, or friends.": "醉心于饮酒和享乐，萨提尔不考虑他们在他人身上煽动的享乐主义的后果。他们让这些人对自己的行为感到神秘。这样的狂欢者可能不得不找借口向父母、雇主、家人或朋友解释他们不正常的状态。",

	" A scarecrow is animated by the bound spirit of a slain evil creature, granting it purpose and mobility. It is this uncanny presence from beyond death that allows a scarecrow to inspire fear in those it gazes upon. Hags and witches often bind scarecrows with the spirits of demons, but any evil spirit will do. Although aspects of the spirit's personality might surface, a scarecrow's spirit doesn't recall the memories it had as a creature, and its will is focused solely on serving its creator. If its creator dies, the spirit inhabiting a scarecrow either continues to follow its last commands, seeks revenge for its creator's death, or destroys itself.": " 稻草人是由一个被杀的邪恶生物的束缚的精神所激活的，赋予它目的和流动性。正是这种来自死亡之外的不可思议的存在，使稻草人能够在它所凝视的人身上激发出恐惧。巫婆和女巫经常用恶魔的灵魂捆绑稻草人，但任何恶灵都可以。虽然精神的某些方面可能会浮出水面，但稻草人的精神不会回忆起它作为生物时的记忆，它的意志只专注于为其创造者服务。如果它的创造者死了，居住在稻草人身上的精神要么继续遵循其最后的命令，要么为其创造者的死亡寻求报复，要么自我毁灭。",

If something beautiful gives hope, a sea hag wants it to cause despair. If it inspires courage, the sea hag wants it to cause fear.": "美貌会驱使海巫师发怒。当面对美丽的东西时，海妖可能会简单地攻击它或玷污它。如果美丽的东西给人以希望，海妖希望它能引起绝望。如果它激发了勇气，海妖希望它引起恐惧。",
	"Sea hags are by far the ugliest of all hags, with slimy scales covering their pallid skin. A sea hag's hair resembles seaweed and covers her emaciated body, and her glassy eyes seem as lifeless as a doll's. Although a sea hag can hide her true form under a veil of illusion, the hag is cursed to forever appear ugly. Her illusory form appears haggard at best.": "海巫师是迄今为止所有巫师中最丑陋的，粘稠的鳞片覆盖着她们苍白的皮肤。海巫师的头发像海藻，覆盖着她憔悴的身体，她玻璃般的眼睛看起来像洋娃娃一样没有生气。尽管海妖可以在幻觉的面纱下隐藏她的真实形态，但海妖被诅咒永远显得丑陋。她的虚幻形态充其量只是显得很憔悴。",

A creature that lives a life of goodness and piety consigns its basest impulses and strongest temptations to the darkness where the shadows hunger. As a shadow drains its victim's strength and physical form, the victim's shadow darkens and begins to move of its own volition. In death, the creature's shadow breaks free, becoming a new undead shadow hungry for more life to consume.": "从黑暗中，影子伸出手来，吸食生物的生命力。它们可以吞噬任何生物，但它们尤其被未被邪恶污染的生物所吸引。一个过着善良和虔诚生活的生物，会把它最卑微的冲动和最强烈的诱惑丢到黑暗中，在那里影子会感到饥饿。当影子耗尽其受害者的力量和身体形态时，受害者的影子会变暗，并开始自行移动。在死亡中，生物的影子挣脱出来，成为一个新的不死影子，渴望更多的生命被吞噬。",
	"If a creature from which a shadow has been created somehow returns to life, its undead shadow senses the return. The shadow might seek its \"parent\" to vex or slay.

	"Shadow demons all but disappear in the darkness, and they can creep about without making a sound. A shadow demon uses its insubstantial claws to feast on its victim's fears, to taste its memories, and drink in its doubts. Bright light harries this fiend and shows its distinct shape, resolving it from a blur of darkness to a winged humanoid creature whose lower body trails off into nothing, and whose claws rend a victim's mind.": "影子恶魔几乎消失在黑暗中，它们可以悄悄地走动而不发出任何声音。影魔用它那没有实体的爪子来吞食它的受害者的恐惧，品尝它的记忆，喝下它的疑虑。明亮的光线会骚扰这种恶魔，并显示出它独特的形状，将它从模糊的黑暗中分辨出来，变成一个有翅膀的人形生物，它的下半身会拖到无影无踪，它的爪子会撕裂受害者的心灵。",

	"The transformation to a shadow dragon happens over a period of years, during which time a dragon's scales lose their luster and fade to a charcoal hue. Its leathery wings become translucent, its eyes paling to pools of opalescent gray. Shadow dragons find sunlight abhorrent, and they are weaker in bright light than they are in darkness. Darkness makes the dragon fade to a spectral shadow of its former self. The magical nature of dragons holds an attraction for the Shadowfell, which seems somehow to crave the might and majesty of these great reptiles. The Shadowfell also has a dispiriting effect on its denizens, such that the longer a creature remains on the plane, the more it accepts the plane's malaise. As months and years pass for a dragon on the Shadowfell, it becomes aware of the transformation being wrought upon it, and yet can do nothing to prevent it.": "转变为影子龙需要几年的时间，在此期间，龙的鳞片会失去光泽并褪去木炭的颜色。它的皮革翅膀变得半透明，它的眼睛苍白成乳白色的灰色。影龙觉得阳光很可怕，它们在强光下比在黑暗中更弱。黑暗使龙褪去了它以前的影子。龙的神奇性质对影子城有一种吸引力，它似乎在某种程度上渴望这些伟大的爬行动物的力量和威严。阴影城对它的居民也有一种消沉的影响，一个生物在这个平面上停留的时间越长，它就越能接受这个平面的萎靡不振。随着时间的推移，龙在暗影之城的时间越来越长，它开始意识到自己正在发生的变化，但却无法阻止它。",
	"A shadow dragon is so suffused with the power of the Shadowfell that even a return to the Material Plane can't undo its transformation.

Others are happy to leave the Shadowfell behind forever, understanding that treasure and power are easier to come by in the Material Plane.": "影龙是如此的充斥着影域的力量，即使回到物质世界也无法解除它的转变。一些影龙试图将其他生物从凡间引回影子城，与它们为伴，至少在它们厌倦了它们的客人并吞噬它们之前。其他人则乐于永远离开暗影城，因为他们知道在物质世界更容易得到财宝和力量。",
	"Only a true dragon can transform into a shadow dragon, and only if it is born in the Shadowfell or remains there for several years.

	"A shambling mound, sometimes called a shambler, trudges ponderously through bleak swamps, dismal marshes, and rain forests, consuming any organic matter in its path.

	"Composed of decaying leaves, vines, roots, and other natural swamp and forest compost, shamblers can blend into their environs. Because they move slowly, they rarely attempt to pursue and catch creatures.

When a creature passes near or alights upon a shambling mound, the monster comes to life, seizing and absorbing the unwary prey.": "由腐烂的树叶、藤蔓、树根和其他天然的沼泽和森林堆肥组成，游荡者可以融入他们的环境中。由于它们行动缓慢，它们很少试图追赶和捕捉生物。相反，它们留在原地，通过从周围环境中吸收营养来维持自己的生命，同时等待猎物来找它们。当有生物经过摇摇晃晃的土丘附近或落脚时，怪物就会活过来，抓住并吸收不警惕的猎物。",
	" A shambling mound results from a phenomenon in which lightning or fey magic invigorates an otherwise ordinary swamp plant. As the plant is reborn into its second life, it chokes the life from plants and animals around it, mulching their corpses in a heap around its roots. Those roots eventually give up their reliance on the soil, directing the shambling mound to seek out new sources of food.": " 一个摇摇欲坠的土堆产生于一种现象，即雷电或精灵魔法使一种普通的沼泽植物恢复了活力。当这种植物获得第二次生命时，它扼杀了周围植物和动物的生命，将它们的尸体堆积在根部周围。这些根系最终放弃了对土壤的依赖，引导这个摇摇欲坠的小丘去寻找新的食物来源。",
	"The instinct that drives a shambling mound is its central root-stem, buried somewhere inside its ponderous form.

	"Despite its monstrous form, the shambling mound is a living plant that requires air and nourishment. Although it doesn't sleep the way an animal does, it can lie dormant for days on end before rising to hunt for food.": "尽管它的形式很怪异，但晃动的土丘是一种活的植物，需要空气和养料。虽然它不像动物那样睡觉，但它可以连续休眠数天，然后再起来觅食。",
	" If a shambling mound faces defeat before an overwhelming foe, the root-stem can feign death, collapsing the remains of its mound. If not subsequently killed, the root-stem beds down in the shambler's remains to slowly regrow its full body, then once again sets out to consume all it can. In this way, shambling mound infestations long thought destroyed can recur time and again.": " 如果一个晃动的土丘在一个压倒性的敌人面前面临失败，根茎可以假装死亡，倒塌其土丘的残骸。如果随后没有被杀死，根茎就会躺在土墩的残骸中，慢慢地重新长出完整的身体，然后再一次开始吞噬所有能吞噬的东西。通过这种方式，长期以来被认为已被消灭的耻辱冢侵扰会一次又一次地复发。",

As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury.": "一条银龙闪闪发光，仿佛是由纯金属雕刻而成的，它的脸因其高大的眼睛和横扫的胡须状下巴而显得格外高贵。一条带刺的流苏在它的头上高高扬起，沿着它的脖子一直延伸到尾巴的顶端。银龙的鳞片是蓝灰色的，有银色的亮点。当银龙接近成年时，它的颜色逐渐变亮，直到它的个别鳞片几乎不可见。随着银龙年龄的增长，它的瞳孔逐渐缩小，直到它的眼睛像水银的球体。",
	"Silver dragons believe that living a moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one's actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings.

	"Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form.

	"Silver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.": "银龙必须定期离开它们的人形生活，回到它们的真身去交配和养育后代，或者去照顾它们的囤积物和个人事务。由于许多人在离开时忘记了时间，他们有时回来时发现他们的同伴已经变老或死亡。银龙常常因此而与一个家庭中的几代人结成朋友。",

Still, skeletons are able to accomplish a variety of relatively complex tasks.": "由法术养成的骷髅被束缚在他们创造者的意志之下。他们严格遵守命令，从不质疑主人交给他们的任务，不计后果。由于他们对命令的字面解释和坚定不移的服从，骷髅对变化的环境适应性很差。除了点头、摇头或指点之外，它们不能阅读、说话、表达或以任何方式交流。尽管如此，骷髅还是能够完成各种相对复杂的任务。",

As the stone's power grew, it became possible for creatures with ordered minds, such as modrons and githzerai, to create enclaves in Limbo. However, Primus's creation had an unforeseen side effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that came to be known as slaadi. Sages refer to Primus's massive creation as the Spawning Stone for this reason.": " 很久以前，普利姆斯，摩德隆的霸主，创造了一块巨大的、几何形状复杂的石头，被赋予了法律的力量。然后他把它扔到了林波星，相信这块石头会给这个位面的混乱带来秩序，并阻止混乱向其他位面蔓延。随着石头力量的增长，具有有序思维的生物，如莫德隆和吉斯泽拉，也有可能在林波星创建飞地。然而，普利姆斯的创造有一个未曾预料到的副作用：石头吸收的混乱能量催生了后来被称为斯拉迪的恐怖。因此，圣人将普利姆斯的巨大创造称为 \"产卵石\"。",
	"The slaadi wiped out every last modron enclave in Limbo. As creatures of utter chaos, slaadi loathe modrons and attack them on sight. Nonetheless, Primus stands by his creation and either doesn't perceive the slaadi as threats or chooses to ignore them.": "斯拉迪人消灭了林堡的每一个莫德隆飞地。作为完全混乱的生物，斯拉迪厌恶莫德隆人，一见到他们就攻击。尽管如此，普利姆斯仍然支持他的创造物，他要么不认为斯拉迪是一种威胁，要么选择忽视他们。",
	"As a slaad emerges from the Spawning Stone, the stone magically implants a fragment of itself in the slaad's brain. This fragment takes the form of a magic gem roughly the size and shape of a human child's fist. The gem is the same color as the slaad. Another creature can use magic to draw forth a slaad's gem and use it to subjugate the slaad. The slaad must obey whoever possesses its gem. If a slaad's gem is destroyed, the slaad can no longer be controlled in this way.": "当Slaad从再生石中出来时，再生石会神奇地在Slaad的大脑中植入一个自身的碎片。这个碎片以魔法宝石的形式出现，其大小和形状与人类小孩的拳头差不多。这颗宝石的颜色与Slaad相同。另一个生物可以使用魔法引出slaad的宝石，并使用它来征服slaad。拥有宝石的人必须服从他的命令。如果石像的宝石被毁，石像就不能再以这种方式被控制。",
	"A slaad born from something other than the Spawning Stone has no gem in its brain, but it gains one if it ever comes into contact with the Spawning Stone. Slaadi on Limbo are attracted to the Spawning Stone, so most end up with a gem. A slaad with a control gem in its brain has the following additional trait.": "由再生石以外的东西所生的斯拉迪，其大脑中没有宝石，但如果它接触到再生石，就会获得一颗。Limbo上的Slaadi被再生石所吸引，所以大多数最终都有一颗宝石。脑子里有控制宝石的斯拉迪有以下的额外特征。",
	"Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against imprisonment, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster's open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A {@spell wish} spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.": "某些法术可以用来获取宝石。如果Slaad对禁锢的救赎失败，该法术可以将宝石转移到施法者的手中，而不是禁锢Slaad。一个{@spell wish}的法术，如果在slaad在场的情况下施展，可以用文字来获得宝石。",
	"A {@spell greater restoration} spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.": "对Slaad施展的{@spell greater restoration}法术会摧毁宝石，但不会伤害到Slaad。",
	" Slaadi have horrific cycles of reproduction. Slaadi reproduce either by implanting humanoid hosts with eggs or by infecting them with a transformative disease called chaos phage. Each color of slaad reproduces or transforms in a different way, with red slaadi spawning blue and green slaadi, and blue slaadi spawning red and green. Each green slaad undergoes a lifelong cycle of transformation into the more powerful gray and death slaadi. With each transformation, the slaad retains its memories.": " 斯拉迪有可怕的繁殖周期。斯拉迪的繁殖方式是将卵子植入人形宿主体内，或者用一种叫做混沌噬菌体的转化疾病感染他们。每种颜色的斯拉迪都以不同的方式繁殖或转化，红色斯拉迪产生蓝色和绿色斯拉迪，而蓝色斯拉迪则产生红色和绿色。每个绿色的Slaad都要经历一个终身的转变周期，变成更强大的灰色和死亡Slaadi。每一次转变，斯拉迪都会保留其记忆。",
	" Some slaadi can transform into the humanoid creatures from which they were originally spawned. These slaadi return to the Material Plane to sow discord in the guise of their former selves.": " 有些斯拉迪可以转化为他们最初产生的人形生物。这些斯拉迪回到物质世界，以他们以前的身份为掩护，散布不和谐。",
	"Smoke mephits are crude, lazy creatures of air and fire that billow smoke constantly. They rarely speak the truth and love to mock and mislead other creatures.": "烟雾梅菲特是粗鲁、懒惰的空气和火的生物，不断地冒出烟雾。他们很少说真话，喜欢嘲弄和误导其他生物。",
	"A solar is godlike in its glory and power.": "一个太阳的荣耀和力量是神一般的存在。",
	"On the battlefield, the solar's sword flies into the fray on its own, and a single arrow from a solar's bow can strike a target dead on contact. So great is a solar's celestial might that even demon princes shrink at its resonant commands.": "在战场上，太阳神的剑会自己飞向战场，而太阳神弓上的一支箭可以让目标一触即溃。太阳神的天威如此之大，甚至连恶魔王子都会因为它的共鸣命令而退缩。",
	"It is said that only twenty-four solars exist. The few solars that are known are stewards of specific deities. The others rest in a state of contemplation, waiting for the time when their services are needed to stave off some cosmic threat to the cause of good.": "据说只有二十四个索拉人存在。为数不多的索拉人是特定神灵的管家。其他的人则在沉思中休息，等待需要他们的服务的时候，以抵御对善的事业的一些宇宙威胁。",
	"A spectator is a lesser beholder that is summoned from another plane of existence by a magical ritual, the components of which include four beholder eyestalks that are consumed by the ritual's magic. Appropriately, a spectator has four eyestalks, two on each side of the wide eye at the center of its four-foot diameter body.": "旁观者是一个被魔法仪式从另一个存在空间召唤出来的小观者，其组成部分包括四个被仪式的魔法所吞噬的观者眼轴。适当地，一个观者有四个眼柄，在其四英尺直径的身体中心的宽大眼睛两侧各有两个。",
	"A summoned spectator guards a location or a treasure of its summoner's choice for 101 years, allowing no creature but its summoner to enter the area or access the item, unless the summoner instructed otherwise. If the item is stolen or destroyed before the years have all passed, a summoned spectator vanishes. It otherwise never abandons its post.": "一个被召唤的观察者会在101年内守卫一个地点或召唤者选择的宝物，除了召唤者之外，不允许任何生物进入该区域或接触该物品，除非召唤者有其他指示。如果物品在年限结束前被盗或被毁，被召唤的观察者就会消失。否则它永远不会放弃自己的岗位。",
	"Though it can speak, a spectator communicates primarily by way of telepathy. It is civil while on guard, openly discussing its orders and its summoner. However, even a brief conversation with a spectator is enough to reveal quirks in its personality brought on by its years of isolation. It might invent imaginary enemies, refer to itself in the third person, or try to adopt the voice of its summoner.": "虽然它能说话，但观察者主要通过心灵感应的方式进行交流。它在守卫时很文明，公开讨论它的命令和它的召唤者。然而，即使是与观察者的简短对话，也足以揭示出它多年与世隔绝所带来的性格怪癖。它可能会编造假想敌，以第三人称称呼自己，或试图采用召唤者的声音。",
	"Like any beholder, a spectator views itself as the epitome of its kind, and it has an intense hatred of other spectators. If two spectators encounter one another, they almost always fight to the death.": "像任何看客一样，观众将自己视为同类的缩影，它对其他观众有强烈的憎恨。如果两个观众彼此相遇，他们几乎总是争得你死我活。",
	"When a spectator has fulfilled its service, it is free to do as it pleases. Many take up residence in the places they previously guarded, especially if their summoners have died. With the spectator's loss of purpose, the flickers of madness it displayed during its servitude flourish.": "当观察者完成了它的服务，它就可以自由地做它喜欢的事。许多人在它们之前守护的地方居住，特别是如果它们的召唤者已经死亡。随着观察者失去目标，它在服役期间表现出的疯狂一闪而过。",
	"A specter is the angry, unfettered spirit of a humanoid that has been prevented from passing to the afterlife. Specters no longer possess connections to who or what they were, yet are condemned to walk the world forever. Some are spawned when dark magic or the touch of a wraith rips a soul from a living body.": "幽灵是被阻止进入来世的人形生物的愤怒、不受约束的精神。幽灵不再拥有与他们的身份或事物的联系，但却注定要永远行走在这个世界上。有些幽灵是在黑魔法或裹尸人的触摸下将灵魂从活人的身体中剥离后产生的。",
	"When a ghost's unfinished business is completed, it can rest at last. No such rest or redemption awaits a specter. It is doomed to the Material Plane, its only end the oblivion that comes with the destruction of its soul. Until then, it bears out its lonely life in forlorn places, carrying on forgotten through the ages of the world.": "当鬼魂的未竟事业完成后，它终于可以休息了。幽灵没有这样的休息或救赎在等着它。它注定要留在物质世界，其唯一的结局是随着其灵魂的毁灭而被遗忘。在那之前，它在荒凉的地方过着孤独的生活，在世界的岁月中继续被遗忘。",
	"Living creatures remind the specter that life is beyond its grasp. The mere sight of the living overwhelms a specter with sorrow and wrath, which can be abated only by destroying said life. A specter kills quickly and mercilessly, for only by depriving others of life can it gain the slightest satisfaction. However, no matter how many lives it extinguishes, a specter always succumbs to its hatred and sorrow.": "活生生的生物提醒幽灵，生命是它无法掌握的。仅仅是看到活人就会让幽灵感到悲伤和愤怒，只有通过摧毁这些生命才能减轻这种悲伤和愤怒。幽灵迅速而无情地杀戮，因为只有通过剥夺他人的生命，它才能获得最轻微的满足。然而，无论它消灭了多少生命，幽灵总是屈服于它的仇恨和悲哀。",
	" Sunlight represents a source of life that no specter can ever hope to douse, and it pains them. When night falls, they leave their final resting places in search of living creatures to slay, knowing that few weapons can harm them in return.": " 阳光代表着任何幽灵都无法指望浇灭的生命之源，这让他们感到痛苦。当夜幕降临时，他们离开最后的休息场所，寻找可以杀死的生物，因为他们知道很少有武器可以伤害他们。",
	"At the first light of dawn, they retreat back into the darkness, where they remain until night falls again.": "在黎明的第一道曙光中，它们又退回到黑暗中，在那里一直呆到黑夜再次降临。",
	"A specter doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "幽灵不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Smaller than most other devils, spinagons act as messengers and spies for greater devils and archdevils. They are the eyes and ears of the Nine Hells, and even fiends that despise a spined devil's weakness treat it with a modicum of respect. A spined devil's body and tail bristle with spines, and it can fling its tail spines as ranged weapons. The spines burst into flame on impact.": "比大多数其他魔鬼更小的刺魔，充当了大魔鬼和大恶魔的信使和间谍。它们是九层地狱的眼睛和耳朵，即使是那些鄙视刺魔弱点的恶魔也会对它有一定程度的尊重。刺魔的身体和尾巴上长满了刺，它可以把尾巴上的刺当作远程武器来甩。这些刺在撞击时迸发出火焰。",
	"When not delivering messages or gathering intelligence, spined devils serve in the infernal legions as flying artillery, making up for their relative weakness by mobbing together to overwhelm their foes. Though they crave promotion and power, spined devils are craven by nature, and they will quickly scatter if a fight goes against them.": "在不传递信息或收集情报的时候，刺魔在地狱军团中充当飞行炮兵，通过聚集在一起压倒敌人来弥补他们的相对弱点。虽然他们渴望晋升和权力，但刺魔的本性是懦弱的，如果战斗对他们不利，他们会迅速散开。",
	"Spirit nagas live in gloom and spitefulness, constantly plotting vengeance against creatures that have wronged them-or that they believe have wronged them. Lairing in dismal caverns and ruins, they devote their time to developing new spells and enslaving the mortals with which they surround themselves. A spirit naga likes to charm its foes, drawing them close so that it can sink its poisonous fangs into their flesh.": "神灵纳迦生活在阴暗和怨恨之中，不断地谋划着对那些对他们不利的生物--或者他们认为对他们不利的生物--进行报复。躲在阴暗的洞穴和废墟中，他们把时间用于开发新的法术和奴役与他们为伍的凡人。灵蛇喜欢迷惑它的敌人，拉近他们的距离，以便将它的毒牙插入他们的肉体。",
	"In secret groves and shaded glens, tiny sprites with dragonfly wings flutter. For all their fey splendor, however, sprites lack warmth and compassion. They are aggressive and hardy warriors, taking severe measures to ward strangers away from their homes. Interlopers that come too close have their moral character judged, then are put to sleep or frightened off.": "在秘密的小树林和阴凉的山谷中，长着蜻蜓翅膀的小精灵在飞舞。然而，尽管精灵们有着美丽的外表，它们却缺乏热情和同情心。他们是好斗而坚韧的战士，采取严厉的措施将陌生人赶出自己的家园。太过接近的入侵者会被评判其道德品质，然后被打入冷宫或被吓走。",
	"Sprites build little villages in the boughs of trees and willing treants, in verdant glades brightened by moss, wild flowers, and toadstools. Wild nature thrives, and the sprites allow no trespassers. When intruders are spotted, the sprites lead them astray with ominous rustling from the bushes and distant snapping twigs. Creatures foolish enough to persist in intruding on a sprite's territory are stung with poisoned arrows and lulled into a senseless sleep. While they slumber, the sprites make good their escape, retreating to an even more secluded area of the forest.": "精灵们在树木的枝桠上和自愿的树人中建立小村庄，在被苔藓、野花和蟾蜍石照亮的青翠小径中。野生的大自然在茁壮成长，精灵们不允许有人闯入。当入侵者被发现时，精灵会用灌木丛中不祥的沙沙声和远处的树枝折断声将他们引入歧途。愚蠢到坚持闯入精灵领地的生物会被毒箭刺伤，并陷入无意识的睡眠。在它们沉睡的时候，精灵们会好好地逃跑，撤退到森林中一个更隐蔽的地方。",
	"Sprites can sense whether a creature is good or evil by the sound and feeling of its beating heart. Weighing the balance of a creature's past actions, a sprite can tell whether its heart beats rapidly in love or flags in sorrow, or whether it is darkened by hate or greed. The sprite's power to perceive the heart always shows the truth, because the heart can't lie.": "精灵可以通过心脏跳动的声音和感觉来感知一个生物是好是坏。通过权衡一个生物过去的行为，精灵可以知道它的心脏是因爱而快速跳动，还是因悲伤而摇摆不定，或者它是否因仇恨或贪婪而变得黑暗。精灵感知心脏的能力总是显示真相，因为心脏不会撒谎。",
	"In their forest domains, sprites brew toxins, unguents, antidotes, and poisons, including the sleep poison with which they coat their arrows. They venture far into the woods to harvest rare flowers, mosses, and fungi, sometimes crossing dangerous territory to do so. If desperate, sprites even steal their ingredients from the gardens of hags.": "在他们的森林领域里，精灵们酿造毒素、解药、解毒剂和毒药，包括他们在箭上涂的睡眠毒药。他们冒险到森林里去采摘稀有的花朵、苔藓和真菌，有时还会穿越危险地带去采摘。若是走投无路，精灵们甚至会从女巫的花园里偷取他们的原料。",
	" Because they are judges of the heart and favor good creatures, sprites oppose the will of evil fey and pledge to thwart evil archfey at every turn. If they encounter adventurers on a quest to rid their forest of an evil fey creature or goblinoid menace, they will pledge their support and even come to their aid when the adventurers least expect it.": " 因为他们是心灵的裁判，偏爱善良的生物，所以精灵们反对邪恶的费伊的意志，并保证随时挫败邪恶的大费伊。如果他们遇到冒险者在为他们的森林清除邪恶的费伊生物或地精威胁的任务，他们会承诺支持他们，甚至在冒险者最不期望的时候来帮助他们。",
	"Unlike pixies, sprites rarely indulge in frivolous merriment and fun. They are firm warriors, protectors, and judges, and their stern bent causes other fey to consider them overly dour and serious. However, fey that respect the sprites' territory find them staunch allies in times of trouble.": "与小精灵不同，精灵们很少沉溺于轻浮的欢愉和乐趣。他们是坚定的战士、保护者和法官，他们严厉的态度使其他精灵认为他们过于沉闷和严肃。然而，尊重精灵领地的费伊人会发现他们在遇到麻烦时是坚定的盟友。",
	"Rulers, nobles, merchants, guildmasters, and other wealthy individuals use spies to gain the upper hand in a world of cutthroat politics. A spy is trained to secretly gather information. Loyal spies would rather die than divulge information that could compromise them or their employers.": "统治者、贵族、商人、行会会长和其他富有的人利用间谍在这个残酷的政治世界中取得优势。间谍接受的训练是为了秘密收集信息。忠诚的间谍宁死也不会泄露可能危及他们或其雇主的信息。",
	"Composed of fire and water, steam mephits leave trails of hot water wherever they go, and they hiss with tendrils of steam. Bossy and hypersensitive, they are the self-appointed overlords of all mephits.": "由火和水组成的蒸汽梅菲特，无论走到哪里都会留下热水的痕迹，并发出蒸汽卷的嘶嘶声。霸道而敏感，他们是所有Mephits的自我任命的霸主。",
	"This horrid flying creature looks like a cross between a large bat and an oversized mosquito. Its legs end in sharp pincers, and its long, needle-like proboscis slashes the air as it seeks its next meal.": "这种可怕的飞行生物看起来像一只大蝙蝠和一只超大的蚊子之间的交叉。它的腿末端是锋利的钳子，长长的、像针一样的探针在空气中划动，寻找下一顿饭。",
	"Stirges feed on the blood of living creatures, attaching and draining them slowly. Although they pose little danger in small numbers, packs of stirges can be a formidable threat, reattaching as quickly as their weakening prey can pluck them off.": "蛭子以生物的血液为食，慢慢地附着并吸干它们的血。虽然它们在数量少的情况下不会构成什么危险，但成群的海蛇可以成为一种可怕的威胁，它们重新附着的速度就像它们衰弱的猎物能把它们摘下来一样快。",
	"A stirge attacks by landing on a victim, finding a vulnerable spot, and plunging its proboscis into the flesh while using its pincer legs to latch on to the victim. Once the stirge has sated itself, it detaches and flies off to digest its meal.": "蛭子的攻击方式是降落在受害者身上，找到一个脆弱的地方，把它的长鼻插进肉里，同时用它的钳子腿抓紧受害者。一旦吸血虫吃饱了，它就会脱离并飞走，以消化它的食物。",
	"Stone giants are reclusive, quiet, and peaceful as long as they are left alone. Their granite-gray skin, gaunt features, and black, sunken eyes endow stone giants with a stern countenance. They are private creatures, hiding their lives and art away from the world.": "石巨人是隐居的，安静的，只要他们不被打扰，就很平静。他们的花岗岩灰色的皮肤，憔悴的特征，以及黑色的、凹陷的眼睛赋予了石巨人严厉的面孔。他们是私密的生物，将自己的生活和艺术隐藏起来，远离世界。",
	"Secluded caves are the homes of the stone giants. Cavern networks are their towns, rocky tunnels their roads, and underground streams their waterways. Isolated mountain ranges are their continents, with the vast spans of land between seen as oceans that the stone giants only rarely cross.": "隐蔽的洞穴是石巨人的家园。洞穴网络是他们的城镇，岩石隧道是他们的道路，地下溪流是他们的水路。孤立的山脉是他们的大陆，中间的大片土地被视为海洋，石巨人只是很少穿越。",
	"In their dark, quiet caves, stone giants wordlessly chip away at elaborate carvings, measuring time in the echoing drip of water into cavern pools. In the deepest chambers of a stone giant settlement, far from the chittering of bats or the patrols paced out by the giants' cave bear companions, are holy places where silence and darkness are complete. Stone takes on its most sacred quality in these cavern cathedrals, their buttresses and columns carved with a beauty that shames the legendary stone craft of the dwarves.": "在他们黑暗、安静的洞穴中，石巨人无声无息地凿开精心制作的雕刻，在水滴进入洞穴池塘的回声中测量时间。在石巨人居住地的最深处，远离蝙蝠的鸣叫或巨人的洞穴熊伙伴的巡逻，是完全沉默和黑暗的圣地。石头在这些洞穴大教堂中具有最神圣的品质，它们的壁垒和柱子的雕刻之美，令矮人的传奇石头工艺汗颜。",
	"Among stone giants, artistry ranks as the greatest virtue. They create intricate murals, paint sprawling murals across cavern walls, and indulge in a wide variety of other artistic disciplines. They esteem stone carving as the greatest of skills.": "在石头巨人中，艺术性是最大的美德。他们创造了复杂的壁画，在洞壁上绘制了大量的壁画，并沉迷于各种其他的艺术学科。他们将石雕视为最伟大的技能。",
	"Stone giants strive to draw shapes out of raw stone, which they believe reveal meaning inspired by their god, Skoraeus Stonebones. The giants appoint the tribe's best carvers as their leaders, shamans, and prophets. The holy hands of such giants become the hands of the god as they work.": "石头巨人努力在原石上画出各种形状，他们认为这些形状揭示了他们的神--斯科雷欧斯-石骨的启示。巨人任命部落中最好的雕刻师为他们的领袖、萨满和先知。这些巨人的圣手在工作时成为神的手。",
	"Despite their great size and musculature, stone giants are lithe and graceful. Skilled rock throwers are granted positions of high rank in the giants' ordning, testing and demonstrating their ability to hurl and catch enormous boulders. Such giants take the front ranks when a tribe has cause to defend its home or attack its enemies. However, even in combat, artistry is key. A stone giant hurling a rock performs not just a feat of brute strength but also one of stunning athleticism and poise.": "尽管石巨人体型巨大，肌肉发达，但他们的身体却很轻盈，很优雅。熟练的投石者在巨人的军团中被授予高级职位，测试和展示他们投掷和捕捉巨大石块的能力。当一个部落有理由保卫自己的家园或攻击敌人时，这样的巨人会站在最前面。然而，即使在战斗中，艺术性也是关键。石头巨人投掷石块时，不仅要表现出蛮力，还要表现出惊人的运动能力和风度。",
	"Stone giants view the world outside their underground homes as a realm of dreams where nothing is entirely true or real. They behave in the surface world the way humanoids might behave in their own dreams, making little account for their actions and never fully trusting what they see or hear. A promise made above ground need not be kept. Insults can be made without apology. Killing prey or sentient beings is no cause for guilt in the dreaming world beneath the sky.": "石巨人将他们地下家园以外的世界视为一个梦境，在那里没有什么是完全真实的。他们在地面世界的行为就像人类在自己的梦境中的行为一样，对自己的行为没有什么交代，也从不完全相信自己看到或听到的东西。在地面上作出的承诺不一定会被遵守。侮辱是可以不道歉的。在天空下的梦境中，杀死猎物或有生命的人是没有理由感到内疚的。",
	"Stone giants lacking in athletic grace or artistic skill dwell at the fringes of their society, serving as the tribe's outlying guardians and far-wandering hunters. When trespassers stray too far into the mountain territory of a stone giant clan, those guardians greet them with hurled rocks and showers of splintered stone. Survivors of such encounters spread tales of stone giant violence, never realizing how little those brutes dwelling in the unreal dreaming world resemble their quiet and artistic kin.": "缺乏运动天赋或艺术技巧的石巨人居住在社会的边缘，充当部落的外围守护者和远行的猎人。当闯入者离石巨人部落的山地太远时，这些守护者就会用投掷的石块和飞溅的碎石来迎接他们。这种遭遇的幸存者传播着石巨人的暴力故事，他们从未意识到那些居住在虚幻的梦境中的野蛮人与他们安静而艺术的亲属有多大的相似之处。",
	"Stone golems display great variety in shape and form, cut and chiseled from stone to appear as tall, impressive statues. Though most bear humanoid features, stone golems can be carved in any form the sculptor can imagine. Ancient stone golems found in sealed tombs or flanking the gates of lost cities sometimes take the forms of giant beasts.": "石雕在形状和形式上表现出极大的多样性，从石头上切割和凿出的石雕看起来像高大的、令人印象深刻的雕像。虽然大多数石雕具有人的特征，但石雕可以被雕刻成雕塑家可以想象的任何形式。在密封的墓穴中或失落的城市大门两侧发现的古代石雕有时会呈现出巨兽的形态。",
	"Like other golems, stone golems are nearly impervious to spells and ordinary weapons. Creatures that fight a stone golem can feel the ebb and flow of time slow down around them, almost as though they were made of stone themselves.": "和其他石像一样，石像几乎不受法术和普通武器的影响。与石像鬼战斗的生物可以感觉到时间的起伏在他们周围变慢，几乎就像他们自己是石头做的一样。",
	"When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the golem is left without instructions or is {@condition incapacitated}, it continues to follow its last orders to the best of its ability. When it can't fulfill its orders, a golem might react violently-or stand and do nothing. A golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates between them.": "当它的创造者或拥有者在现场指挥它的时候，巨魔的表现是完美无缺的。如果魔像没有得到指示或被{@condition incapacitated}，它就会继续尽其所能地遵循其最后的命令。当它不能履行命令时，巨魔可能会做出剧烈的反应，或者站着什么都不做。一个被赋予相互冲突的命令的巨魔有时会在它们之间交替进行。",
	"Storm giants are contemplative seers that live in places far removed from mortal civilization. Most have pale purple-gray skin and hair, and glittering emerald eyes.": "风暴巨人是沉思的预言家，生活在远离凡间文明的地方。大多数人都有苍白的紫灰色皮肤和头发，以及闪闪发光的翡翠色眼睛。",
	"Some rare storm giants are violet-skinned, with deep violet or blue-black hair and silvery gray or purple eyes. They are benevolent and wise unless angered, in response to which the fury of a storm giant can affect the fate of thousands.": "一些罕见的风暴巨人是紫色皮肤，拥有深紫色或蓝黑色的头发和银灰色或紫色的眼睛。除非被激怒，否则他们是仁慈和明智的，对此，风暴巨人的愤怒可以影响成千上万人的命运。",
	"Storm giants live in isolated refuges so far above the surface of the world or below the sea that they are beyond the reach of most other creatures. Some make their abodes in cloud-top castles so high that flying dragons appear as specks below. Others live atop mountain peaks that pierce the clouds. Some occupy palaces covered with algae and coral at the bottom of the ocean, or grim fortresses in undersea rifts.": "风暴巨兽生活在与世隔绝的避难所中，远远高于世界表面或低于海洋，以至于其他大多数生物都无法到达。有些人住在云顶城堡中，其高度之高，使飞龙在下面看起来像斑点。还有的住在刺破云层的山峰之上。有些则居住在海底被海藻和珊瑚覆盖的宫殿里，或者是海底裂缝中的狰狞堡垒。",
	"Storm giants recall the glory of ancient giant empires forged by the god Annam. They seek to restore what was lost when those empires fell. They don't compete for status in the ordning but live out the centuries of their existence in contemplative seclusion, watching the starry heavens and the ocean's depths for signs, symbols, and omens of Annam's favor.": "风暴巨人们回忆起由安南神铸造的古代巨人帝国的荣耀。他们试图恢复那些帝国灭亡时失去的东西。他们不在秩序中争夺地位，而是在沉思的隐居中度过他们存在的几个世纪，观察星空和海洋深处的迹象、符号和安纳姆青睐的预兆。",
	"Storm giants see the events of the world in a wide perspective. They can foretell the rise and fall of kings and empires, see the beginnings and ends of fortune and disaster, and find the patterns within seemingly unrelated events. By reading omens and prophesying, storm giants learn of vast secrets previously unknown and troves of lore utterly forgotten.": "风暴巨头以广阔的视角看待世界上的事件。他们可以预言国王和帝国的兴衰，看到财富和灾难的开始和结束，并在看似不相关的事件中找到规律。通过解读预兆和预言，风暴巨人了解到以前不为人知的巨大秘密和被彻底遗忘的传说宝库。",
	"Kings will rise and fall, wars will be won and lost, and good and evil will wrestle in conflict. Storm giants have watched these events in the manner of mortal gods over many lifetimes, and they know it is pointless to intervene. Even so, a storm giant might willingly disclose certain secrets to benevolent beings that visit its remote domain with specific purpose. Such creatures must speak and act respectfully, however, for a storm giant roused to anger is a force of utter destruction.": "国王将兴起和衰落，战争将赢得和失去，善与恶将在冲突中搏斗。风暴巨人以凡人之神的方式观察了这些事件多时，他们知道干预是毫无意义的。即便如此，风暴巨人也可能愿意向带着特定目的访问其偏远领域的仁慈的生物透露某些秘密。然而，这样的生物必须恭敬地说话和行事，因为被激怒的风暴巨人是一种彻底的毁灭力量。",
	"Storm giants communicate infrequently with others of their kind. They do so usually to compare signs and omens or engage in a rare courtship. Storm giant parents stay together to raise a child to maturity, then return to the solitary isolation they cherish.": "风暴巨兽不经常与其他同类交流。他们这样做通常是为了比较征兆和预兆，或者进行罕见的求爱。风暴巨兽的父母呆在一起，将孩子养育成人，然后回到他们所珍视的孤独的环境中。",
	"Some humanoid cultures worship storm giants as they would worship lesser gods, creating myths and stories around the giants' exploits and vast knowledge. A storm giant is governed by the dictates of its conscience, however, and not by any culture's laws or codes of honor. As such, a storm giant that bends its mind toward greed or gains a taste for petty power can easily become a terrible threat.": "一些人形文化对风暴巨人的崇拜就像他们对小神的崇拜一样，围绕着巨人的功绩和丰富的知识创造神话和故事。然而，风暴巨人受其良知的支配，而不是受任何文化的法律或荣誉准则的支配。因此，风暴巨人如果贪婪成性，或者对小权力有兴趣，很容易成为一个可怕的威胁。",
	"Succubi and incubi inhabit all of the Lower Planes, and the lascivious dark-winged fiends can be found in service to devils, demons, night hags, rakshasas, and yugoloths.

The demon lord Graz'zt keeps succubi and incubi as advisers and consorts.": "淫妖和魔女居住在所有的下层世界，这些淫荡的黑翼恶魔可以被发现为魔鬼、恶魔、夜魔、罗刹和尤格罗特服务。九层地狱的统治者阿斯莫德（Asmodeus）利用这些恶魔来引诱凡人进行邪恶的行为。恶魔领主格拉兹兹特（Graz'zt）保留琥珀和妖精作为顾问和妃子。",
	"Though legend speaks of them separately, any succubus can become an incubus, and vice versa. Most of these fiends do have a preference for one form or the other. Mortals only rarely see a succubus or incubus in its true form, however, for the fiend typically begins its corruption in veiled, insidious ways.": "虽然传说中它们是分开的，但任何魅魔都可以变成妖魔，反之亦然。这些恶魔中的大多数人都偏爱一种形式或另一种形式。然而，凡人很少看到魅魔或妖魔的真实形态，因为这种恶魔通常以隐蔽、阴险的方式开始腐败。",
	"A succubus or incubus first appears in ethereal form, passing through walls like a ghost to lurk next to a mortal's bedside and whisper forbidden pleasures. Sleeping victims are tempted to give in to their darkest desires, indulge in taboos, and feed forbidden appetites. As the fiend fills the victim's dreams with debauched images, the victim becomes more susceptible to temptation in everyday life.": "魅魔或妖怪首先以空灵的形式出现，像幽灵一样穿墙而过，潜伏在凡人的床边，低声诉说禁忌的快乐。沉睡的受害者被引诱向他们最黑暗的欲望屈服，沉溺于禁忌，满足禁忌的胃口。当恶魔用放荡的形象填满受害者的梦境时，受害者在日常生活中变得更容易受到诱惑。",
	"Inevitably, the fiend enters the mortal realm in tempting form to directly influence a creature's actions. Appearing in the guise of a humanoid who has previously appeared only in the victim's dreams, the succubus or incubus seduces or befriends its victim, indulging all its desires so that it performs evil acts of its own free will.": "不可避免的是，恶魔以诱惑的形式进入凡间，直接影响一个生物的行为。魅魔以之前只在受害者梦中出现过的人形伪装出现，引诱或结交受害者，放纵其所有的欲望，使其按照自己的意愿实施邪恶行为。",
	"A mortal bequeaths its soul to the fiend not by formal pledge or contract. Instead, when a succubus or incubus has corrupted a creature completely-some say by causing the victim to commit the three betrayals of thought, word, and deed-the victim's soul belongs to the fiend. The more virtuous the fiend's prey, the longer the corruption takes, but the more rewarding the downfall. After successfully corrupting a victim, the succubus or incubus kills it, and the tainted soul descends into the Lower Planes.": "凡人将其灵魂遗赠给恶魔，并不是通过正式的誓言或合同。相反，当魅魔完全腐蚀了一个生物--有人说是通过使受害者犯下思想、语言和行为这三种背叛行为--受害者的灵魂属于恶魔。魔鬼的猎物越贤惠，腐蚀的时间就越长，但堕落的回报也越大。在成功地腐蚀了一个受害者之后，魅魔会杀死他，而被污染的灵魂则会下降到下层世界。",
	"The succubus or incubus resorts to charming a victim magically only when necessary, usually as a form of self-defense. A {@condition charmed} creature isn't responsible for its actions, so forcing it to behave against its will won't bring the fiend closer to the ultimate prize: the victim's soul.": "魅魔或妖怪只有在必要时才会用魔法迷惑受害者，通常是作为一种自卫的形式。一个{@condition charmed}的生物并不对自己的行为负责，所以强迫它违背自己的意愿并不会使恶魔更接近最终的奖赏：受害者的灵魂。",
	"The kiss of a succubus or incubus is an echo of the emptiness that is the fiend's longing for a corrupted soul. Likewise, the recipient of the fiend's kiss gains no satisfaction from it, experiencing only pain and the profound emptiness that the fiend imparts. The kiss is nothing short of an attack, usually delivered as a final farewell before the fiend escapes.": "魅魔的吻是空虚的回声，这是恶魔对堕落灵魂的渴望。同样地，接受恶魔之吻的人也无法从中获得满足，只能体验到痛苦和恶魔所带来的深刻的空虚。这个吻无异于一次攻击，通常是作为恶魔逃跑前的最后告别。",
	"Succubi and incubi can reproduce with one another to spawn more of their kind. Less commonly, a succubus or incubus reproduces with a humanoid. From this unholy union, a cambion child is conceived. Invariably, the fiendish offspring is as wicked as its fiendish parent.": "魅魔和伊卡比可以互相繁殖，以产生更多的同类。不太常见的情况是，一个魅魔或妖精与一个人形生物进行繁殖。从这种不洁的结合中，会孕育出一个cambion孩子。无一例外的是，这个恶魔般的后代和它恶魔般的父母一样邪恶。",
	"The legendary tarrasque is possibly the most dreaded monster of the Material Plane. It is widely believed that only one of these creatures exists, though no one can predict where and when it will strike.": "传说中的塔拉斯克可能是物质世界中最令人恐惧的怪物。人们普遍认为，这种生物只存在一种，尽管没有人能够预测它将在什么地方和什么时候发作。",
	"A scaly biped, the tarrasque is fifty feet tall and seventy feet long, weighing hundreds of tons. It carries itself like a bird of prey, leaning forward and using its powerful lashing tail for balance. Its cavernous maw yawns wide enough to swallow all but the largest creatures, and so great is its hunger that it can devour the populations of whole towns.": "塔拉斯克是一种有鳞的双足动物，身高50英尺，长70英尺，体重达数百吨。它像一只猎物鸟一样带着自己，身体向前倾斜，用它那强大的尾巴来保持平衡。它那张洞开的大嘴足以吞下除最大的生物外的所有生物，它的饥饿感如此之强，以至于它可以吞噬整个城镇的人口。",
	"The destructive potential of the tarrasque is so vast that some cultures incorporate the monster into religious doctrine, weaving its sporadic appearance into stories of divine judgment and wrath.": "塔拉斯克的破坏力是如此之大，以至于一些文化将这种怪物纳入宗教教义，将其零星的出现编入神圣的审判和愤怒的故事。",
	"Legends tell how the tarrasque slumbers in its secret lair beneath the earth, remaining in a dormant state for decades or centuries. When it awakens in answer to some inscrutable cosmic call, it rises from the depths to obliterate everything in its path.": "传说中，龙卷风如何在地底下的秘密巢穴中沉睡，保持几十年或几个世纪的休眠状态。当它响应某种不可捉摸的宇宙召唤而苏醒时，它就会从深渊中升起，抹去沿途的一切。",
	"Thri-kreen wander the deserts and savannas of the world, avoiding all other races.": "Thri-kreen在世界的沙漠和草原上游荡，避开所有其他种族。",
	" Thri-kreen employ a language without words. To show emotion and reaction, a thri-kreen clacks its mandibles and waves its antennae, giving other thri-kreen a sense of what it is thinking and feeling. Other creatures find this manner of communication difficult to interpret and impossible to duplicate.": " Thri-kreen使用一种没有语言的语言。为了表示情绪和反应，Thri-Kreen会敲打下颚，挥动触角，让其他Thri-Kreen感觉到它在想什么和感觉到什么。其他生物发现这种交流方式很难解释，也无法复制。",
	"When forced to interact with creatures of other intelligent species, thri-kreen employ alternative methods of communication, such as drawing pictures in sand or making pictures out of twigs or blades of grass.": "当被迫与其他智能物种的生物互动时，Thri-kreen会采用其他交流方法，如在沙子上画画或用树枝或草叶作画。",
	"Thri-kreen experience the full range of emotions but aren't as prone to emotional outbursts as humans. Thri-kreen with psionic ability often demonstrate a wider range of emotions, particularly if they live near or interact with humans or other highly emotional creatures.": "Thri-kreen能体验到全部的情绪，但不像人类那样容易情绪失控。具有幻觉能力的Thri-kreen常常表现出更广泛的情绪，特别是当他们生活在人类或其他高度情绪化的生物附近或与之互动时。",
	"Thri-kreen consider all other living creatures as potential nourishment, and they love the taste of elf flesh in particular. If a creature might be useful for something other than food, the thri-kreen aren't likely to attack it on sight. Thri-kreen kill to survive, never for sport.": "Thri-kreen认为所有其他生物都是潜在的营养品，他们尤其喜欢精灵肉的味道。如果一种生物可能对食物以外的东西有用，那么特里格林人不可能一见到它就攻击它。Thri-kreen杀人是为了生存，而不是为了运动。",
	"Thri-kreen don't require sleep and can rest while remaining alert and performing light tasks. Their inability to sleep is thought to be the reason why thri-kreen have such short lifespans, the average thri-kreen life expectancy being only thirty years.": "Thri-kreen不需要睡眠，可以在休息的同时保持警觉并执行轻度任务。他们不能睡觉被认为是Thri-Green寿命如此之短的原因，Thri-Green的平均寿命只有30年。",
	"Thugs are ruthless enforcers skilled at intimidation and violence. They work for money and have few scruples.": "暴徒是无情的执行者，擅长恐吓和暴力。他们为钱而工作，没有什么顾忌。",
	"Treants are awakened trees that dwell in ancient forests. Although treants prefer to while away the days, months, and years in quiet contemplation, they fiercely protect their woodland demesnes from outside threats.": "树人是居住在古老森林中的觉醒的树木。虽然树人更喜欢在安静的沉思中度过白天、月份和年月，但他们激烈地保护他们的林地领地免受外部威胁。",
	"A tree destined to become a treant meditates through a long cycle of seasons, living normally for decades or centuries before realizing its potential. Trees that awaken do so only under special circumstances and in places steeped with nature's magic. Treants and powerful druids can sense when a tree has the spark of potential, and they protect such trees in secret groves as they draw near the moment of their awakening. During the long process of awakening, a tree acquires face-like features in its bark, a division of the lower trunk into legs, and long branches bending downward to serve as its arms. When it is ready, the tree pulls its legs free from the clutching earth and joins its fellows in protecting its woodland home.": "一棵注定要成为树人的树在漫长的季节循环中进行冥想，在实现其潜力之前正常生活了几十年或几个世纪。只有在特殊情况下，在充满自然魔力的地方，树才会觉醒。树人和强大的德鲁伊能感觉到一棵树有潜力的火花，当它们接近觉醒的时刻时，他们会在秘密的丛林中保护这些树。在漫长的觉醒过程中，树木的树皮上会出现类似人脸的特征，树干下部会分成腿，长长的树枝会向下弯曲作为手臂。当它准备好的时候，树把它的腿从紧握的土地上拉开，和它的伙伴们一起保护它的林地家园。",
	"After a treant awakens, it continues to grow exactly as it did when it was a tree. Treants created from the mightiest trees can reach great sizes while developing an innate magical power over plants and animals. Such treants can animate plants, using them to ensnare and trap intruders. They can call wild creatures to aid them or carry messages across great distances.": "树人觉醒后，会继续成长，就像它还是一棵树时一样。从最强大的树木中创造出来的树人可以达到很大的体型，同时对植物和动物发展出一种天生的神奇力量。这样的树人可以使植物有生命，用它们来诱捕和困住入侵者。他们可以召唤野生动物来帮助他们，或者跨越遥远的距离传递信息。",
	"Even after awakening, a treant spends much of its time living as a tree. While rooted in place, a treant remains aware of its surroundings, and can perceive the effects of events taking place miles away based on subtle changes nearby.": "即使在觉醒后，树人也会花很多时间作为一棵树生活。虽然扎根在原地，但树人仍能意识到周围的环境，并能根据附近的细微变化感知到数英里外发生的事件的影响。",
	"Woodcutters who avoid culling healthy living trees and hunters who take only what they need of the forest's bounty are unlikely to arouse a treant's ire. Creatures careless with fire, those who poison the forest, and those who destroy great trees, especially a tree close to awakening, face the treant's wrath.": "避免砍伐健康的活树的伐木者和只拿他们需要的森林赏赐的猎人，不太可能引起树人的愤怒。不小心用火的生物，那些毒害森林的人，以及那些破坏大树的人，特别是接近觉醒的树，都会面临树人的愤怒。",
	"Tribal warriors live beyond civilization, most often subsisting on fishing and hunting. Each tribe acts in accordance with the wishes of its chief, who is the greatest or oldest warrior of the tribe or a tribe member blessed by the gods.": "部落战士生活在文明之外，最常以捕鱼和打猎为生。每个部落都按照其首领的意愿行事，首领是部落中最伟大或最年长的战士，或是受到神灵祝福的部落成员。",

	"The savage, degenerate troglodytes squat in the shallow depths of the Underdark in a constant state of war against their neighbors and one another. They mark the borders of their territories with cracked bones and skulls, or with pictographs painted in blood or dung.": "野蛮、堕落的troglodytes蹲在暗黑世界的浅层深处，不断地与他们的邻居和相互之间发生战争。他们用破裂的骨头和头骨，或者用血迹或粪便画出的象形文字来标记他们领土的边界。",

The walls of their cavern homes are smeared with grime, oily secretions, and the debris of their foul feasting.": "也许是所有人类中最令人厌恶的，troglodytes吃任何他们能吃的东西。他们住在肮脏的地方。它们洞穴的墙壁上沾满了污垢、油性分泌物和它们肮脏的大餐的残渣。",
	"Troglodytes have a simple, communal culture devoted almost entirely to procuring food. Too simple to plan more than a few days into the future, troglodytes rely on constant raids and hunting to survive. They take sadistic pleasure in hunting intelligent creatures weaker than themselves and show no mercy toward those they capture and drag back to their lairs to be devoured. The largest and toughest troglodytes lead the hunt and become the leaders of their tribes. However, if a leader shows any weakness or hesitation, other troglodytes attack and eat it in a frenzy.": "蛙人有一种简单的、集体的文化，几乎完全致力于采购食物。蛙人太简单了，无法对未来进行几天的规划，他们依靠不断的突袭和狩猎来生存。他们以猎杀比自己弱小的智能生物为乐，对那些被他们捕获并拖回巢穴吞食的生物毫不留情。最大和最强壮的troglodytes领导狩猎，并成为他们部落的领袖。然而，如果领导者表现出任何软弱或犹豫不决，其他troglodytes就会疯狂地攻击并吃掉它。",
	"Troglodytes make little and build less, scavenging their possessions from their prey. They understand the value of metal weapons and armor, and fight among one another for the right to have such items. A troglodyte tribe might be torn apart by battles over a single longsword.": "Troglodytes制造的东西很少，建造的东西也少，他们从猎物身上搜刮财产。他们了解金属武器和盔甲的价值，并为拥有这些物品的权利而相互争夺。一个troglodyte部落可能会因为争夺一把长剑而四分五裂。",
	"Some troglodytes venerate Laogzed, a demonic, monstrously fat toad-lizard that slumbers in the Abyss.

	"Smashing a troll's bones and slashing through its rubbery hide only makes it angry. A troll's wounds close quickly. If the monster loses an arm, a leg, or even its head, those dismembered parts can sometimes act with a life of their own. A troll can even reattach severed body parts, untroubled by its momentary disability. Only acid and fire can arrest the regenerative properties of a troll's flesh. The trolls, enraged, will attack individuals making acid and fire attacks against them above all other prey.": "砸碎巨魔的骨头和砍破它的橡胶皮只会让它生气。巨魔的伤口很快就会愈合。如果怪物失去了一条胳膊、一条腿，甚至是它的头，那些被肢解的部分有时会有自己的生命。巨魔甚至可以重新接上被切断的身体部分，而不为其一时的残疾所困扰。只有酸和火才能阻止巨魔肉体的再生特性。被激怒的巨魔会攻击个人，对他们进行酸和火的攻击，超过所有其他猎物。",
	"Their regenerative capabilities make trolls especially susceptible to mutation. Although uncommon, such transformations can result from what the troll has done or what has been done to it.

	"This enormous predator terrorizes all other creatures in its territory. Despite its size and weight, a tyrannosaurus is a swift runner.

	"A unicorn's brow sports a single spiraling horn of ivory whose magical touch can heal the sick and the injured. Its ears catch the words and whispers of the creatures that share its domain, and it knows the tongues of elves and sylvan folk.

Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.": "无论吸血鬼是否保留了前世的任何记忆，它的情感依恋都会随着曾经纯洁的感情被不死之身扭曲而枯萎。爱情变成了饥饿的迷恋，而友谊变成了痛苦的嫉妒。作为情感的替代，吸血鬼追求他们所渴望的物质象征，因此，寻求爱情的吸血鬼可能会固定在一个年轻的美女身上。一个孩子可能会成为痴迷于青春和潜力的吸血鬼的迷恋对象。其他人则用艺术、书籍或邪恶的物品围绕着自己，如酷刑装置或他们杀死的生物的战利品。",
	"Most of a vampire's victims become vampire spawn-ravenous creatures with a vampire's hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master's control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies.": "大多数吸血鬼的受害者都会变成吸血鬼的卵--具有吸血鬼对血液的渴望的贪婪的生物，但受创造它们的吸血鬼的控制。如果一个真正的吸血鬼允许产卵者从自己的身体里吸血，那么产卵者就会转变为一个真正的吸血鬼，不再受其主人的控制。很少有吸血鬼愿意以这种方式放弃他们的控制。吸血鬼卵子在其创造者死后会变得自由意志。",
	"Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn't receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way.": "每个吸血鬼都被束缚在它的棺材、墓穴或墓地中，它必须在那里休息一天。如果吸血鬼没有得到正式的埋葬，它必须躺在它向不死之身过渡的地方的一英尺的土下。吸血鬼可以通过将其棺材或大量的墓土运到另一个地方来移动其埋葬的地方。有些吸血鬼通过这种方式设置了多个安息地。",
	"Neither a vampire nor a vampire spawn requires air.": "吸血鬼和吸血鬼的后代都不需要空气。",
	"A vampire chooses a grand yet defensible location for its lair, such as a castle, fortified manor, or walled abbey. It hides its coffin in an underground crypt or vault guarded by vampire spawn or other loyal creatures of the night.": "吸血鬼会选择一个宏伟但可防御的地点作为其巢穴，如城堡、坚固的庄园或有墙的修道院。它将自己的棺材藏在地下墓穴或金库中，由吸血鬼的后代或其他忠诚的夜行生物守护。",
	"The save DC for Charm is 8 + the vampire's proficiency bonus + the vampire's Charisma modifier. The character's alignment becomes lawful evil, and the DM might take control of the character until the vampirism is reversed with a {@spell wish} spell or the character is killed and brought back to life.": "魅惑的救赎DC是8 + 吸血鬼的熟练度加成 + 吸血鬼的魅力修改器。该角色的定位变成合法的邪恶，并且DM可能会控制该角色，直到用{@spell wish}的法术逆转吸血鬼，或者该角色被杀死并复活。",
	"A brilliant thinker and capable warrior in life, Strahd von Zarovich fought in countless battles for his people. When war and killing finally stripped him of his youth and strength, he settled in the remote valley of Barovia and built a castle on a towering pinnacle, from which he could survey his lands. His brother Sergei came to live with him in Castle Ravenloft, becoming Strahd's adviser and constant companion.": "斯特拉赫-冯-扎罗维奇生前是一位杰出的思想家和能干的战士，为他的人民参加了无数次战斗。当战争和杀戮最终剥夺了他的青春和力量时，他在偏远的巴罗维亚山谷定居，并在一个高耸的山峰上建造了一座城堡，从那里他可以看到他的土地。他的弟弟谢尔盖和他一起住在乌鸦堡，成为斯特拉赫特的顾问和常伴。",
	"In his brother, Strahd saw everything he had lost. Sergei was handsome and young, while Strahd had become old and scarred. Resentment colored their relationship, eventually turning into hatred. Strahd's beloved, Tatyana, spurned him for Sergei, whom she pledged to marry.": "在他弟弟身上，斯特拉赫特看到了他所失去的一切。谢尔盖英俊而年轻，而斯特拉赫特却变得老态龙钟、伤痕累累。怨恨使他们的关系变得丰富多彩，最终变成了仇恨。斯特拉特的爱人塔季扬娜为了谢尔盖抛弃了他，她发誓要嫁给他。",
	"In a desperate attempt to win Tatyana's heart, Strahd forged a pact with dark powers that made him immortal. At the wedding of Sergei and Tatyana, he confronted his brother and killed him. Tatyana fled and flung herself from Ravenloft's walls. Strahd's guards, seeing him for a monster, shot him with arrows. But he did not die. He became a vampire-the first vampire, according to many sages.": "为了赢得塔季扬娜的心，斯特拉赫特不顾一切地与黑暗势力订立了一个契约，使他成为不死之身。在谢尔盖和塔季扬娜的婚礼上，他与哥哥对峙并杀死了他。塔蒂亚娜逃跑了，从雷文洛夫特的城墙上跳了下去。斯特拉特的卫兵看到他是个怪物，就用箭射他。但他并没有死。他成了吸血鬼--据许多圣人说，他是第一个吸血鬼。",
	"In the centuries since his transformation, Strahd's lust for life and youth have only grown. He broods in his dark castle, cursing the living for stealing away what he lost, and never admitting his hand in the tragedy he created.": "在他变身后的几个世纪里，斯特拉赫特对生命和青春的渴望只增不减。他在自己的黑暗城堡里发呆，诅咒活着的人偷走他失去的东西，而且从不承认自己参与了他制造的悲剧。",
	"Veterans are professional fighters that take up arms for pay or to protect something they believe in or value. Their ranks include soldiers retired from long service and warriors who never served anyone but themselves.": "退伍军人是为报酬或为保护他们相信或重视的东西而拿起武器的职业战士。他们的队伍包括从长期服役中退役的士兵和除了自己之外从未为任何人服务的战士。",
	"Appearing as masses of slithering creepers, vine blights hide in undergrowth and wait for prey to draw near. By animating the plants around them, vine blights entangle and hinder their foes before attacking. Vine blights are the only blights capable of speech. Through its connection to the evil spirit of the Gulthias tree it serves, a vine blight speaks in a fractured version of its dead master's voice, taunting victims or bargaining with powerful foes.": "藤疫病以大量滑行的爬行动物的形式出现，隐藏在灌木丛中，等待猎物靠近。通过使它们周围的植物具有生命力，藤疫在攻击前会缠住并阻碍它们的敌人。蔓生菌是唯一能够说话的菌种。通过与它所服务的古尔蒂亚斯树的恶灵的联系，藤疫会用它死去的主人的声音的断裂版说话，嘲弄受害者或与强大的敌人讨价还价。",
	"This purplish mushroom uses root-like feelers growing from its base to creep across cavern floors. The four stalks protruding from a violet fungi's central mass are used to lash out at prey, rotting flesh with the slightest touch. Any creature killed by a violet fungus decomposes rapidly. A new violet fungus sprouts from the moldering corpse, growing to full size in {@dice 2d6} days.": "这种略带紫色的蘑菇利用从其底部生长出来的根状触角，在洞穴地面上匍匐前进。从紫罗兰真菌的中心部位伸出的四根菌柄被用来攻击猎物，只要轻轻一碰就会使肉体腐烂。任何被紫罗兰真菌杀死的生物都会迅速腐烂。一个新的紫罗兰真菌从腐烂的尸体上长出，在{@dice 2d6}天内长成全尺寸。",
	"Vrocks are dull-witted, capricious fiends that live only to create pain and carnage. A vrock resembles a giant hybrid of humanoid and vulture, its gnarled, bestial body and broad wings stinking of offal.": "弗洛克是头脑迟钝、反复无常的恶魔，只为制造痛苦和杀戮而活着。弗洛克类似于一个巨大的人形和秃鹰的混合体，它那布满虬结的兽性身体和宽大的翅膀散发着内脏的恶臭。",
	"Vrocks gobble humanoid flesh whenever they can, stunning potential prey with an ear-splitting shriek, then swooping down to attack with beak and claw. Vrocks can shake their wings, releasing clouds of toxic spores.": "Vrocks一有机会就吞食人肉，用刺耳的尖叫声震慑潜在的猎物，然后俯冲下来用喙和爪子攻击。Vrocks可以摇动它们的翅膀，释放出有毒的孢子云。",
	"Coveting pretty things, vrocks turn against each other for the chance to lay claim to cheap jewelry or ornamental stones. Despite their love of treasure, vrocks are difficult to bribe, seeing no reason to bargain when they can simply take what they want from a would-be bargainer's corpse.": "贪恋漂亮的东西，vrocks为了获得廉价珠宝或装饰石的机会而互相争夺。尽管他们对财宝情有独钟，但弗洛克却很难被收买，因为他们认为如果能从潜在的讨价还价者的尸体上拿走他们想要的东西，就没有理由进行讨价还价。",
	"A water elemental is a cresting wave that rolls across the ground, becoming nearly invisible at it courses through a larger body of water. It engulfs creatures that stand against it, filling their mouths and lungs as easily as it smothers flame.": "水元素是一种在地面上翻滚的波浪，当它穿过较大的水体时，几乎变得不可见。它吞噬了站在它面前的生物，填满了它们的嘴和肺，就像熏死火焰一样容易。",
	"A water weird is an elemental guardian bound to a specific water-filled location, such as a pool or fountain.": "水怪是被束缚在一个特定的充满水的地方的元素守护者，比如一个水池或喷泉。",
	"Invisible while immersed in water, its serpentine shape becomes clear only when it emerges to attack, using its coils to crush any creature other than its summoner and those its summoner declares as off limits. When slain, a water weird becomes an inanimate pool of water.": "当它浸泡在水中时是不可见的，只有当它浮出水面进行攻击时，它的蛇形才会变得清晰，用它的线圈压碎除它的召唤者和它的召唤者宣布为禁区以外的任何生物。被杀死后，水怪会变成一滩无生命的水。",
	"Like most elementals, a water weird has no concept of good or evil. However, a water weird bound to a sacred or befouled source of water begins to take on the nature of that site, becoming neutral good or neutral evil.": "像大多数元素一样，水怪没有善或恶的概念。然而，与神圣的或被污染的水源结合在一起的水怪开始具有该地点的性质，成为中性的善或中性的恶。",
	"A neutral good water weird tries to frighten away interlopers rather than kill them, while a neutral evil water weird kills its victims for pleasure and might turn against its summoner. A water weird loses its evil alignment if its waters are cleansed with a {@spell purify food and drink} spell.": "中性善良的水怪会试图吓跑入侵者而不是杀死他们，而中性邪恶的水怪则会以杀死受害者为乐，并可能转向反对其召唤者。如果水怪的水被用{@spell purify food and drink}的法术清洗过，它就会失去邪恶的倾向。",
	"A water weird doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "一个水怪不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Werebears are powerful lycanthropes with the ability to temper their monstrous natures and reject their violent impulses. In humanoid form, they are large, muscular, and covered in hair matching the color of their ursine form's fur. A werebear is a loner by nature, fearing what might happen to innocent creatures around it when its bestial nature takes over.": "狼人是强大的狼人，他们有能力控制自己的怪异天性，拒绝暴力冲动。在人形状态下，他们身材高大，肌肉发达，浑身的毛发与他们犬类的毛发颜色一致。狼人天生是个独行侠，害怕当它的兽性占上风时，周围无辜的生物会发生什么。",
	"When a werebear transforms, it grows to enormous size, lashing out with weapons or claws. It fights with the ferocity of a bear, though even in its bestial forms, it avoids biting so as to not pass on its curse. Typically, a werebear passes on its lycanthropy only to chosen companions or apprentices, spending the time that follows helping the new lycanthrope accept the curse in order to control it.": "当狼人变身时，它长到了巨大的体型，用武器或爪子猛击。它以熊的凶猛战斗，尽管即使在它的兽性形态下，它也会避免咬人，以避免将其诅咒传递下去。通常情况下，狼人只把它的狼性传给选定的同伴或学徒，在接下来的时间里帮助新的狼人接受诅咒，以控制它。",
	"Solitary creatures, werebears act as wardens over their territory, protecting flora and fauna alike from humanoid or monstrous intrusion. Though most werebears are of good alignment, some are every bit as evil as other lycanthropes.": "狼人是一种孤独的生物，他们在自己的领地上充当守卫者，保护动植物免遭人形或怪物的入侵。虽然大多数狼人都是善良的，但有些狼人也和其他狼人一样邪恶。",
	"Wereboars are ill-tempered and vulgar brutes. As humanoids, they are stocky and muscular, with short, stiff hair. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, they use heavy weapons, while in hybrid or animal form, they gain a devastating goring attack through which their curse is spread. A wereboar infects other creatures indiscriminately, relishing the fact that the more its victims resist the curse, the more savage and bestial they become.": "狼人是脾气暴躁、粗俗的野蛮人。作为人形生物，他们身材魁梧，肌肉发达，有短而硬的头发。在人形和混血儿形态下，他们使用重型武器，而在混血儿或动物形态下，他们获得了一种毁灭性的啮齿攻击，通过这种攻击，他们的诅咒得以传播。狼人不分青红皂白地感染其他生物，并乐于看到受害者越是抵制诅咒，他们就越是野蛮和兽性。",
	"Wereboars live in small family groups in remote forest areas, building ramshackle huts or dwelling in caves. They are suspicious of strangers but sometimes ally themselves with orcs.": "狼人生活在偏远森林地区的小型家庭群体中，建造破旧的小屋或居住在洞穴中。他们对陌生人持怀疑态度，但有时会与兽人结盟。",
	"Wererats are cunning lycanthropes with sly, avaricious personalities. They are wiry and twitchy in humanoid form, with thin hair and darting eyes. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, wererats prefer light weapons and use ambush tactics rather than fighting as a pack. Although a wererat can deliver a nasty bite in its rat form, it favors that form for stealthy infiltration and escape rather than combat.": "Wererats是狡猾的狼人，具有狡猾、贪婪的个性。他们在人形状态下是粗壮的、抽搐的，头发稀疏，眼神呆滞。在他们的人形和混合形态中，狼人喜欢轻型武器，并使用伏击战术，而不是作为一个群体战斗。尽管在老鼠形态下，狼人可以提供令人讨厌的咬伤，但它更喜欢用这种形态进行隐蔽的渗透和逃跑，而不是战斗。",
	"A wererat clan operates much like a thieves' guild, with wererats transmitting their curse only to creatures they want to induct into the clan. Wererats that are accidentally cursed or break loose from the clan's control are quickly hunted down and killed.": "狼人氏族的运作方式很像盗贼公会，狼人只把他们的诅咒传给他们想加入氏族的生物。不小心被诅咒或脱离氏族控制的狼人很快就会被追捕和杀害。",
	"Wererat clans are found throughout urban civilization, often dwelling in cellars and catacombs. These creatures are common in the sewers beneath major cities, viewing those subterranean areas as their hunting grounds. Rats and giant rats are commonly found living among wererats.": "Wererat氏族在整个城市文明中被发现，经常居住在地窖和地下墓穴中。这些生物在主要城市下面的下水道中很常见，将这些地下区域视为它们的狩猎场。鼠类和巨鼠通常被发现生活在狼人中。",
	"Weretigers are ferocious hunters and warriors with a haughty and fastidious nature. Lithe and sleekly muscular in humanoid form, they are taller than average and meticulously groomed. Weretigers grow to enormous size in animal and hybrid form, but they fight in their more refined humanoid form when they can.": "狼人是凶猛的猎手和战士，具有傲慢和急躁的天性。在人形状态下，他们身形轻盈，肌肉光滑，比一般人要高，而且修饰得很细致。狼人在动物和混血儿的形态下能长到巨大的体型，但当他们能以更精致的人形形态战斗时，他们也会以人形形态战斗。",
	"They don't like to pass on their curse, because every new weretiger means competition for territory and prey.": "它们不喜欢把诅咒传下去，因为每只新的狼虎都意味着对领土和猎物的竞争。",
	"Weretigers live in jungles on the fringes of humanoid civilization, traveling to isolated settlements to trade or revel. They live and hunt alone or in small family groups.": "狼人生活在类人文明边缘的丛林中，到孤立的定居点进行交易或狂欢。他们独自生活和狩猎，或在小型的家庭团体中。",
	"A werewolf is a savage predator. In its humanoid form, a werewolf has heightened senses, a fiery temper, and a tendency to eat rare meat. Its wolf form is a fearsome predator, but its hybrid form is more terrifying by far-a furred and well-muscled humanoid body topped by a ravening wolf's head. A werewolf can wield weapons in hybrid form, though it prefers to tear foes apart with its powerful claws and bite.": "狼人是一种野蛮的捕食者。在人形形态下，狼人具有高度的感官，火爆的脾气，并倾向于吃稀有的肉类。狼的形态是一种可怕的捕食者，但它的混合形态则更为可怕--毛茸茸的、肌肉发达的人形身体上顶着一个乌黑的狼头。狼人可以在混合形态下挥舞武器，不过它更喜欢用它强大的爪子和咬力将敌人撕碎。",
	"Most werewolves flee civilized lands not long after becoming afflicted. Those that reject the curse fear what will happen if they remain among their friends and family. Those that embrace the curse fear discovery and the consequences of their murderous acts. In the wild, werewolves form packs that also include wolves and dire wolves.": "大多数狼人在受到折磨后不久就逃离了文明的土地。那些拒绝诅咒的人担心如果他们留在朋友和家人中间会发生什么。那些接受诅咒的人害怕被发现，害怕他们的谋杀行为带来的后果。在野外，狼人组成的狼群也包括狼和地狼。",
	"The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of the chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.": "白龙是最小的、最不聪明的、最兽性的色龙，居住在寒冷的气候中，喜欢北极地区或冰山。它们是被饥饿和贪婪驱使的凶恶、残忍的爬行动物。",
	"A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.": "白龙有一双野性的眼睛，圆滑的轮廓，以及一个带刺的徽章。白龙的鳞片闪烁着纯白色的光芒。随着年龄的增长，它的光泽消失了，一些鳞片开始变黑，所以当它年老的时候，它的鳞片上会有淡蓝色和浅灰色的斑点。这种图案有助于白龙融入它所狩猎的冰石领域，当它在充满云彩的天空中翱翔时，也会从视野中消失。",
	"White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.": "白龙缺乏大多数其他龙的狡猾和战术。然而，它们的兽性使它们成为所有龙族中最好的猎手，只专注于生存和屠杀它们的敌人。白龙只吃被冰冻过的食物，吞噬被其呼吸武器杀死的生物，而它们仍然是僵硬和冰冷的。它将其他被杀的动物包裹在冰中，或将它们埋在巢穴附近的雪中，发现这样一个储藏室是一个很好的迹象，表明附近住着一只白龙。",
	"A white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warnings to intruders.": "白龙还将其最大的敌人的尸体作为战利品，将尸体冷冻在它可以看到的地方并幸灾乐祸。巨人、雷莫哈兹和其他龙的遗体通常被放置在白龙巢穴的显眼位置，作为对入侵者的警告。",
	"Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unless moved to do so.": "虽然只有中等的智力，但白龙有非凡的记忆。它们记得每一次的轻视和失败，并且已知会对冒犯过它们的生物进行恶意报复。这通常包括银龙，它们与白龙在同一地区筑巢。白龙可以像所有龙一样说话，但它们很少说话，除非被感动。",
	"White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.": "白龙避开所有其他龙，除非是异性的白龙。即使如此，当白龙互相寻找配偶时，它们在一起的时间也只够孕育后代，然后再次逃到隔离的地方。",
	"White dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.": "白龙不能容忍对手靠近它们的巢穴。因此，白龙会在没有挑衅的情况下攻击其他生物，认为这些生物要么太弱，要么太强大，无法生存。唯一通常为白龙服务的生物是聪明的人形生物，它们表现出足够的力量来平息龙的愤怒，并且能够忍受由于龙的饥饿而造成的定期损失。这包括崇拜龙的哥布林，这在他们的巢穴中很常见。",
	"Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.": "强大的生物有时可以通过展示身体或魔法的力量来获得白龙的服从。冰霜巨人向白龙发起挑战，以证明自己的实力并提高自己在族中的地位，他们的碎骨在许多白龙的巢穴中到处可见。然而，被冰霜巨人打败的白龙往往会成为它的仆人，接受一个高级生物的控制权，以换取自己对其他服务于或反对巨人的生物的统治权。",
	"White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities, particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arctic climes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bone sculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.": "白龙喜欢冰的冷光，喜欢具有类似品质的宝物，特别是钻石。然而，在他们偏远的北极地区，白龙的宝藏中更多的是海象和猛犸象牙、鲸骨雕塑、船只的头像、毛皮以及从过于大胆的冒险家手中缴获的魔法物品。",
	"Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikes them. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.": "松散的硬币和宝石散布在白龙的巢穴中，当光线照射到它们时，像星星一样闪闪发光。较大的宝物和箱子被包裹在白龙的呼吸所产生的石灰层中，并在透明的冰层下保持安全。白龙的巨大力量使它能够轻易地获取财富，而较小的生物必须花几个小时的时间来削除或融化冰层，才能到达白龙的主要囤积物。",
	"A white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature making the offer and seize the treasure on their own.": "白龙的记忆无懈可击，这意味着它知道自己是如何拥有其囤积的每一枚硬币、宝石和魔法物品的，并且它将每一件物品与一场特定的胜利联系起来。白龙是出了名的难以贿赂，因为任何提供的财宝都被视为对它们能力的侮辱，它们可以简单地杀死提供财宝的生物，自己夺取财宝。",
	"White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.": "白龙的巢穴在远离阳光的冰洞和地下深室中。它们喜欢只有通过飞行才能到达的高山峡谷、悬崖峭壁上的洞穴，以及冰川中迷宫般的冰洞。白龙喜欢洞穴中的垂直高度，像蝙蝠一样飞到天花板上抓取，或者从冰冷的裂缝中滑下。",
	"A legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon's presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.": "一条传奇的白龙的先天魔法加深了其巢穴周围地区的寒冷。山洞会因为白龙的存在而迅速冻结。白龙通常可以通过其巢穴中的龙吟风的音调变化来发现入侵者。",
	"A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in its lair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.": "一条白龙停在它的巢穴中的高高的冰架和悬崖上，它周围的地面是由破碎的冰和石头、隐藏的坑和滑溜溜的斜坡组成的险恶的泥沼。当敌人挣扎着走向它时，白龙从一个栖息地飞到另一个栖息地，用它冰冷的气息摧毁他们。",
	"The word \"wight\" meant \"person\" in days of yore, but the name now refers to evil undead who were once mortals driven by dark desire and great vanity. When death stills such a creature's heart and snuffs its living breath, its spirit cries out to the demon lord Orcus or some vile god of the underworld for a reprieve: undeath in return for eternal war on the living. If a dark power answers the call, the spirit is granted undeath so that it can pursue its own malevolent agenda.": "在过去的日子里，\"wight \"这个词的意思是 \"人\"，但现在这个名字指的是邪恶的亡灵，他们曾经是被黑暗欲望和巨大虚荣心驱使的凡人。当死亡扼杀了这种生物的心脏，扼杀了它的生命气息，它的灵魂就会向恶魔领主奥库斯或一些卑鄙的冥界之神呼喊，以获得缓刑：以不死换取对活人的永恒战争。如果黑暗势力回应了这一呼唤，它的灵魂就会获得不死之身，这样它就可以追求自己的邪恶议程。",
	"Wights possess the memories and drives of their formerly living selves. They will heed the call of whatever dark entity transformed them into undead, swearing oaths to appease their new lord while retaining their autonomy. Never tiring, a wight can pursue its goals relentlessly and without distraction.": "巫师拥有他们以前活着的自己的记忆和驱动力。他们会听从将他们转化为不死之身的任何黑暗实体的召唤，在保持自主性的同时，发誓要安抚他们的新主宰。巫师永不疲倦，可以无休止地追求自己的目标，而不会分心。",
	"Neither dead nor alive, a wight exists in a transitional state between one world and the next. The bright spark it possessed in life is gone, and in its place is a yearning to consume that spark in all living things.": "巫师既不死也不活，存在于一个世界和另一个世界之间的过渡状态。它生前拥有的明亮的火花已经消失，取而代之的是对吞噬所有生物的火花的渴望。",
	"When a wight attacks, this life essence glows like white-hot embers to its dark eyes, and the wight's cold touch can drain the spark through flesh, clothing, and armor.": "当巫师攻击时，这种生命精华会像白热的余烬一样在它的黑眼睛里发光，而巫师的冰冷触觉可以通过肉体、衣服和盔甲耗尽火花。",
	"Wights flee from the world by day, away from the light of the sun, which they hate. They retreat to barrow mounds, crypts, and tombs where they dwell. Their lairs are silent, desolate places, surrounded by dead plants, noticeably blackened, and avoided by bird and beast.": "巫师们白天逃离世界，远离他们讨厌的太阳光。他们退缩到他们居住的荒冢、地窖和坟墓中。他们的巢穴是寂静、荒凉的地方，周围都是枯萎的植物，明显发黑，鸟类和野兽都避之不及。",
	"Humanoids slain by a wight can rise as zombies under its control. Motivated by hunger for living souls and driven by the same desire for power that awakened them in undeath, some wights serve as shock troops for evil leaders, including wraiths. As soldiers, they are able to plan but seldom do so, relying on their hunger for destruction to overwhelm any creature that stands before them.": "被巫师杀死的人类可以在其控制下变成僵尸。在对活人灵魂的饥渴的驱使下，一些巫师在未死时也被唤醒了对力量的渴望，他们为邪恶的领袖充当突击队，包括裹尸人。作为士兵，他们能够进行计划，但很少这样做，而是依靠他们对毁灭的饥渴来压倒站在他们面前的任何生物。",
	"A wight doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "幽灵不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Will-o'-wisps are malevolent, wispy balls of light that haunt lonely places and battlefields, bound by dark fate or dark magic to feed on fear and despair.": "Will-o'-wisps是邪恶的、飘忽不定的光球，它们在孤独的地方和战场上出没，被黑暗的命运或黑暗的魔法束缚，以恐惧和绝望为食。",
	"Will-o'-wisps look like bobbing lantern lights in the distance, although they can choose to alter their colors, or wink out completely. When they activate their lights, will-o'-wisps offer hope, hinting of safety to creatures that follow them.": "Will-o'-wisps看起来像远处晃动的灯笼灯，尽管它们可以选择改变颜色，或者完全眨眼。当它们启动灯光时，Will-o'-wisps提供了希望，向跟随它们的生物暗示了安全。",
	"Will-o'-wisps lure unwary creatures into quicksand pits, monster lairs, and other dangerous places so that they can feed on the suffering of their prey and revel in their death screams. An evil being that falls prey to a will-o'-wisp might become a wisp itself, its woeful spirit coalescing above its lifeless corpse like a flickering flame.": "威尔-o'-wisps把不小心的生物引诱到流沙坑、怪物巢穴和其他危险的地方，这样它们就能以猎物的痛苦为食，并陶醉于它们的死亡尖叫声。沦为鬼魂猎物的邪恶生物可能会自己变成鬼魂，其悲惨的灵魂像闪烁的火焰一样凝聚在其无生命的尸体之上。",
	" Will-o'-wisps are the souls of evil beings that perished in anguish or misery as they wandered forsaken lands permeated with powerful magic. They thrive in swampy bogs and bone-strewn battlefields where the oppressive weight of sorrow stoops even heavier than the low-hanging mist and fog. Trapped in these desolate places of lost hope and memory, will-o'-wisps lure other creatures toward dismal fates and feed on their misery.": " 巫师是邪恶生物的灵魂，他们在被遗弃的土地上游荡时，在痛苦或不幸中丧生，被强大的魔法所渗透。他们在沼泽地和尸骨遍地的战场上茁壮成长，在那里，悲伤的压迫感甚至比低垂的薄雾和雾气更重。困在这些失去希望和记忆的荒凉地方，女巫们引诱其他生物走向悲惨的命运，并以他们的痛苦为食。",
	"Will-o'-wisps rarely speak, but when they do, their voices sound like faint or distant whispers. In the miserable domains they haunt, will-o'-wisps sometimes form symbiotic relationships with their wicked neighbors. Hags, oni, black dragons, and evil cultists work with will-o'-wisps to draw creatures into ambush. As their evil allies surround and slaughter creatures, the wisps hover above them, drinking the agony of a last breath and savoring the sensation as the light of life goes out in a creature's eyes.": "威利斯人很少说话，但当他们说话时，他们的声音听起来像微弱或遥远的耳语。在它们出没的悲惨领域中，鬼怪有时会与它们邪恶的邻居形成共生关系。女巫、鬼神、黑龙和邪恶的崇拜者与女巫合作，将生物引向伏击。当他们的邪恶盟友包围和屠杀生物时，巫师们在他们上方盘旋，喝下最后一口气的痛苦，并品味生物眼中生命之光熄灭时的感觉。",
	"A will-o'-wisp doesn't require air, drink, or sleep.": "巫师不需要空气、饮料或睡眠。",
	"The arctic-dwelling winter wolf is as large as a dire wolf but has snow-white fur and pale blue eyes. Frost giants use these evil creatures as guards and hunting companions, putting the wolves' deadly breath weapon to use against their foes. Winter wolves communicate with one another using growls and barks, but they speak Common and Giant well enough to follow simple conversations.": "居住在北极的冬狼和地狼一样大，但有雪白的皮毛和淡蓝色的眼睛。冰霜巨人使用这些邪恶的生物作为守卫和狩猎伙伴，用狼的致命呼吸武器来对付他们的敌人。冬狼用咆哮和吠叫互相交流，但它们能说普通话和巨人语，足以听懂简单的对话。",
	"A worg is an evil predator that delights in hunting and devouring creatures weaker than itself. Cunning and malevolent, worgs roam across the remote wilderness or are raised by goblins and hobgoblins. Those creatures use worgs as mounts, but a worg will turn on its rider if it feels mistreated or malnourished. Worgs speak in their own language and Goblin, and a few learn to speak Common as well.": "虫子是一种邪恶的捕食者，以猎杀和吞噬比自己弱小的生物为乐。狡猾而恶毒的虫子在遥远的荒野中游荡，或者被地精和妖精养大。这些生物把虫子当作坐骑，但如果虫子感到被虐待或营养不良，它就会背叛它的骑手。虫子说他们自己的语言和哥布林语，少数也会学习说普通话。",
	"A wraith is malice incarnate, concentrated into an incorporeal form that seeks to quench all life. The creature is suffused with negative energy, and its mere passage through the world leaves nearby plants blackened and withered. Animals flee from its presence. Even small fires can be extinguished by the sucking oblivion of the wraith's horrifying existence.": "裹尸人是恶意的化身，集中在一个无体的形式中，试图熄灭所有的生命。这种生物充斥着负面的能量，它在这个世界上的存在使附近的植物变黑和枯萎。动物会逃离它的存在。即使是小火也会被裹尸人可怕的存在所吸食遗忘而熄灭。",
	"When a mortal humanoid lives a debased life or enters into a fiendish pact, it consigns its soul to eternal damnation in the Lower Planes. However, sometimes the soul becomes so suffused with negative energy that it collapses in on itself and ceases to exist the instant before it can shuffle off to some horrible afterlife. When this occurs, the spirit becomes a soulless wraith-a malevolent void trapped on the plane where it died. Almost nothing of the wraith's former existence is preserved; in this new form, it exists only to annihilate other life.": "当一个凡人过着堕落的生活或订立了邪恶的契约时，它的灵魂就会在下层世界受到永恒的诅咒。然而，有时灵魂变得如此充斥着负能量，以至于它在自己身上崩溃，并在它可以洗去一些可怕的来世之前就不存在了。当这种情况发生时，灵魂会变成一个没有灵魂的包裹--一个被困在它死去的平面上的恶性虚空。裹尸人以前的存在几乎没有被保留下来；在这种新形式下，它的存在只是为了消灭其他生命。",

	"A wraith might retain a few memories of its mortal life as shadowy echoes. However, even the strongest events and emotions become little more than faint impressions, fleeting as half-remembered dreams. A wraith might pause to stare at something that fascinated it in life, or it might curb its wrath in acknowledgment of a past friendship. Such moments come rarely, however, because most wraiths despise what they were as a reminder of what they have become.": "裹尸人可能会保留其凡人生活的一些记忆，作为朦胧的回声。然而，即使是最强烈的事件和情感也不过是微弱的印象，像半梦半醒之间转瞬即逝。裹尸人可能会停下脚步，凝视它生前着迷的东西，或者它可能会抑制自己的怒火，承认过去的友谊。然而，这样的时刻很少出现，因为大多数裹尸人都鄙视他们的过去，认为这是对他们已经成为的一种提醒。",
	"A wraith can make an undead servant from the spirit of a humanoid creature that has recently suffered a violent death. Such a fragment of woe becomes a specter, spiteful of all that lives.": "巫师可以从最近遭受暴力死亡的人形生物的灵魂中制造一个不死的仆人。这样的悲哀碎片会变成一个幽灵，对所有活着的人充满怨恨。",
	"Wraiths sometimes rule the legions of the dead, plotting the doom of living creatures. When they emerge from their tombs to do battle, life and hope shrivel before them. Even if a wraith's armies are forced to retreat, the lands its forces occupied are so blasted and withered that those who live there often starve and die.": "巫师有时统治着死亡军团，策划着生物的厄运。当他们从坟墓里出来作战时，生命和希望在他们面前萎靡不振。即使巫师的军队被迫撤退，其军队占领的土地也会被炸毁和枯萎，生活在那里的人往往会饿死。",

	"A wyvern has two scaly legs, leathery wings, and a sinewy tail topped with its most potent weapon: a poison stinger. The poison in a wyvern's stinger can kill a creature in seconds. Extremely potent, wyvern poison burns through its victim's bloodstream, disintegrating veins and arteries on its way to the heart. As deadly as wyverns can be, however, hunters and adventurers often track them to claim the venom, which is used in alchemical compounds and to coat weapons.": "狼牙棒有两条有鳞的腿，皮质的翅膀，以及一条蜿蜒的尾巴，上面有它最有力的武器：毒刺。狼牙棒中的毒可以在几秒钟内杀死一个生物。狼牙棒的毒性极强，它在受害者的血液中燃烧，在到达心脏的途中瓦解静脉和动脉。然而，尽管狼毒是致命的，猎人和冒险家经常追踪它们以获取毒液，这些毒液可用于炼金术和武器涂层。",
	"A wyvern doesn't fight on the ground unless it can't reach its prey by any other means, or if it has been fooled into a position from which aerial combat isn't an option.

If it corners a fleeing creature in an enclosure too small to enter, a wyvern guards where the quarry hides, lashing with its stinger whenever opportunity allows.": "只有当它受到严重伤害，或者猎物被它躲避了足够长的时间，让另一个更容易的潜在猎物徘徊时，才会对它的猎物退缩。如果它在一个小得不能再小的围栏里发现了一个逃跑的生物，狼獾就会守在猎物藏身的地方，只要有机会就会用它的毒刺猛击。",
	"Although they possess more cunning than ordinary beasts, wyverns lack the intelligence of their draconic cousins. As such, creatures that maintain their composure as a wyvern hunts them from the air can often elude or trick it. Wyverns follow a direct path to their prey, with no thought given to possible ambushes.": "虽然它们拥有比普通野兽更多的狡猾，但狼獾缺乏它们龙族表亲的智慧。因此，当狼獾从空中追捕它们时，保持镇定的生物往往可以躲避或欺骗它。狼獾会沿着一条直接通往猎物的道路前进，而不会考虑到可能的伏击。",
	"A wyvern can be tamed for use as a mount, but doing so presents a difficult and deadly challenge. Raising one as a hatchling offers the best results. However, a wyvern's violent temperament has cost the life of many a would-be master.": "狼人可以被驯服作为坐骑使用，但这样做是一个困难和致命的挑战。将其作为幼崽来养是最好的结果。然而，狼牙棒的暴躁性情让许多可能成为主人的人付出了生命。",
	"Bizarre creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Earth, xorn sniff out gemstones and precious metals, then tunnel through earth and rock to consume those treasures.

	"Before an avalanche, a blizzard, or a deadly frost, the yetis' howls sweep down the mountain slopes on the icy wind. Some people of the alpine peaks believe that the voices of loved ones killed in avalanches and blizzards sound out in the wails of the yetis, crying warnings of ill omen. More pragmatic folk attest that the yeti's howl is a reminder that, despite the great accomplishments of civilization, the civilized become the hunted in nature's untamed domain.": "在发生雪崩、暴风雪或致命的霜冻之前，雪人的嚎叫声在冰冷的风中掠过山坡。高山顶峰的一些人相信，在雪崩和暴风雪中丧生的亲人的声音在雪人的哀号中响起，哭着警告不祥之兆。更加务实的人证明，雪人的嚎叫是一种提醒，尽管文明取得了巨大的成就，但在自然界的野蛮领域，文明人变成了猎物。",

	"Devious mountain folk sometimes use the yetis as unwitting weapons. A warlord might lay down slaughtered sheep or goats to draw yetis into an enemy's camp, sowing chaos and thinning the ranks before battle.

Yuan-ti temples stood at the centers of ancient metropolises, reaching ever higher in prayer to the gods they longed to emulate. In time, the serpent gods heard those prayers, their sibilant voices responding from the darkness as they told the yuan-ti what they must do. The yuan-ti religion grew more fanatical in its devotion.

Unlike demons, yugoloths can be reasoned with, but unlike devils, they are rarely true to their word.": "被召唤的尤戈洛人对他们的时间和忠诚度要求很高。当更好的机会出现时，无论尤戈洛人做出什么承诺都会很快被打破。与恶魔不同，尤戈洛人可以被说动，但与恶魔不同，他们很少信守诺言。",
	"Yugoloths can be found anywhere, but the high cost of maintaining a yugoloth army's loyalty typically exceeds what any warlord on the Material Plane can pay. Being self-serving creatures, yugoloths quarrel among themselves constantly. A yugoloth army is more organized than a ravening horde of demons, but far less orderly and regimented than a legion of devils. Without a powerful leader to keep them in line, yugoloths fight simply to indulge their violent predilections, and only as long as it benefits them to do so.": "在任何地方都可以找到尤格罗人，但维持尤格罗人军队的忠诚度的高昂成本通常超过物质世界的任何军阀所能支付的。作为一种自我服务的生物，尤格罗人之间的争吵不断。尤格罗人的军队比贪婪的恶魔部落更有组织性，但远不如恶魔军团那么有秩序和有条理。如果没有一个强大的领袖来维持他们的秩序，尤戈洛人战斗只是为了放纵他们的暴力倾向，而且只要这样做对他们有利就可以了。",
	"When a yugoloth dies, it dissolves into a pool of ichor and reforms at full strength on the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna. Only on its native plane can a yugoloth be destroyed permanently.

On Gehenna, it is more apt to retreat or plead for mercy if its demise seems imminent.": "当yugoloth死亡时，它会溶入一滩ichor，并在Gehenna的黯淡永恒中以全盛状态进行改造。只有在它的本位面，yugoloth才能被永久地摧毁。yugoloth知道这一点并采取相应的行动。当被召唤到其他位面时，yugoloth会不顾自己的安危进行战斗。在Gehenna，如果它的死亡似乎迫在眉睫，它更倾向于撤退或恳求怜悯。",

	"When all four copies of the Books of Keeping disappeared, Asmodeus and the night hags lost control of their yugoloth creations. Each Book of Keeping still exists, drifting from plane to plane, where the brave and the foolish occasionally stumble upon them. A yugoloth summoned using its true name, as inscribed in the Books of Keeping, is forced to serve its summoner obediently. The yugoloth hates being controlled in this manner and isn't shy about making its displeasure known. Like a petulant child, it will follow its instructions to the letter while looking for opportunities to misinterpret them.": "当所有四本《守护之书》都消失后，阿斯莫德和夜行者失去了对他们的尤戈洛特创造物的控制。每本守护之书仍然存在，从一个位面漂移到另一个位面，勇敢的人和愚蠢的人偶尔会在那里偶然发现它们。使用刻在《守护之书》上的真名召唤的尤戈洛人，被迫顺从地服务于召唤者。尤戈洛人讨厌以这种方式被控制，并不吝于表达自己的不满。就像一个任性的孩子，它将严格遵守其指令，同时寻找机会曲解它们。",

	"Zombies appear as they did in life, showing the wounds that killed them. However, the magic that creates these vile creatures often takes time to run its course. Dead warriors might rise from a battlefield, eviscerated and bloated after days in the sun. The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way from the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie might wash ashore or rise from a marsh, swollen and reeking after weeks in the water.": "僵尸的出现与他们生前一样，显示出杀死他们的伤口。然而，创造这些卑劣生物的魔法往往需要时间来完成它的过程。死去的战士可能会从战场上站起来，在太阳下晒了几天后，他们的内脏被剥落，身体臃肿。泥泞的农民尸体可能会从地面上爬起来，上面布满了蛆虫和蠕虫。一个僵尸可能被冲上岸，或者从沼泽地里爬出来，在水里泡了几周后肿胀并发出恶臭。",

Aboleths use their telepathic powers to read the minds of creatures and know their desires.

The summoned yugoloth remains for l minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner takes a bonus action to dismiss it": "一个被召唤的尤格洛斯((yugoloth))出现在其召唤者60英尺内的未被占据的空间中，它可以随心所欲地行动（除非其召唤者是乌尔特洛斯((ultroloth))，在这种情况下，它将作为其召唤者的盟友行动），并且不能召唤其他尤格洛斯。被召唤的尤格洛斯会持续1分钟，直到它或其召唤者死亡，或者直到其召唤者采取一个额外动作将其解散。",

	"Most zombies are made from humanoid remains, though the flesh and bones of any formerly living creature can be imbued with a semblance of life. Necromantic magic, usually from spells, animates a zombie. Some zombies rise spontaneously when dark magic saturates an area. Once turned into a zombie, a creature can't be restored to life except by powerful magic, such as a {@spell resurrection} spell.": "大多数僵尸是由人形遗骸制成的，尽管任何曾经活过的生物的肉体和骨骼都可以被赋予生命的幻象。通常是通过咒语的死灵魔法使僵尸复活。当黑暗魔法充斥一个区域时，有些僵尸会自发地复活。一旦变成僵尸，生物除非通过强大的魔法，比如{@spell resurrection}咒语，否则无法恢复生命。",
	"After Beek died, we cast an {@spell animate dead} spell on his corpse. It was fun for a while, but the zombie started to smell real bad, so we doused it in oil and set it on fire. Beek would've found that hilarious.": "在 Beek 去世后，我们对他的尸体施加了一个 {@spell animate dead} 法术。一开始很有趣，但是这具僵尸开始散发出真正的臭味，所以我们把它浸泡在油里然后点燃了。Beek 一定会觉得这很滑稽。"
