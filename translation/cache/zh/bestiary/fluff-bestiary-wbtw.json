	"In days gone by, Agdon Longscarf made a name for himself as he and his band of miscreants menaced travelers throughout various Feywild domains. It was in Prismeer, however, that Agdon's antics came to an end by Zybilna's hand. As punishment for his offenses, the archfey demanded that Agdon give up his beloved scarf. When he refused, Zybilna cursed him so that he would never be able to remove it. She then pinned the scarf to a young sapling with a magic nail made of gold and iron, and she bade the tree grow until its branches raked the clouds. Agdon was thus carried into the sky, where he was stranded for a long time.": "在过去的日子里，阿格登-朗斯卡夫和他的一帮恶棍在整个费城的各个领域里威胁着旅行者，使自己名声大振。然而，正是在普利斯梅尔，阿格登的恶作剧在齐比尔纳的手中终结了。作为对他罪行的惩罚，大法官要求阿格登交出他心爱的围巾。当他拒绝时，齐比尔纳诅咒他，让他永远无法摘下围巾。然后她用金铁制成的魔法钉将围巾钉在一棵小树苗上，她让这棵树长大，直到它的树枝刮到云层。阿格东就这样被带到了天上，在那里他被滞留了很长时间。",
	"The arrival of the Hourglass Coven signaled a reversal of Agdon Longscarf's fortunes. With Zybilna trapped in temporal stasis, Agdon's loyal gang was able to chop down his tree prison. But his scarf remained pinned to the felled trunk, and him with it, until Bavlorna struck a deal with him—she agreed to remove the nail and free the scarf in exchange for the best prize from each of his raids thereafter.": "沙漏女巫团的到来标志着阿格登-朗斯卡夫的命运发生了逆转。随着齐比尔纳被困于时空静止状态，阿格登的忠诚帮派能够砍掉他的树牢。但他的围巾仍然被钉在被砍倒的树干上，他也被钉在上面，直到巴弗洛娜与他达成协议--她同意拔掉钉子并释放围巾，以换取他此后每次突袭的最佳奖励。",
	"Agdon's scarf is a bright blue length of cloth that he claims was woven from lightning bolts he stole right out from under a dark cloud. The scarf can't be removed, even if Agdon dies. His branding iron functions for him alone, and it ceases to be hot when it leaves his hand. The brand it makes is shaped like three bounding rabbits connected nose to tail, forming a triangle.": "阿格登的围巾是一条亮蓝色的布，他声称这是他从乌云下偷出来的闪电织成的。即使阿格登死了，这条围巾也不能被摘掉。他的烙铁只对他一个人有用，离开他的手后就不再是热的。它制造的烙印形状像三只跳动的兔子，鼻子和尾巴相连，形成一个三角形。",

	"Younger than Skabatha and older than Endelyn, Bavlorna is called Slack-jawed Lorna because her wide mouth is prone to hang agape. Flies flit in and out of it. She is the hag of the present, the here and now, the moment to moment. Those desperate individuals who seek her out do so to find a remedy for a nagging problem or anxiety. Though she despises unannounced visitors, a tragic tale of woe and misery puts her in a bargaining mood. If these visitors enter into an agreement with Bavlorna, she'll use her powers to resolve their pressing problem in exchange for something of use to her.": "巴夫洛尔娜比斯卡巴塔年轻，比恩德林年长，她被称为松弛下巴的洛尔娜，因为她那张宽大的嘴很容易张开。苍蝇从里面飞进飞出。她是当下的巫婆，此时此地，一刻不停。那些绝望的人找她，是为了寻找一个补救的办法来解决唠叨的问题或焦虑。虽然她鄙视不请自来的访客，但一个悲惨的故事和苦难让她有了讨价还价的心情。如果这些来访者与巴弗洛娜达成协议，她会用她的力量来解决他们迫切的问题，以换取对她有用的东西。",
	"Brigganocks are frantic, mouse-sized creatures that live in mines. Whenever a mortal makes a nonmagical wish, perhaps while blowing out the candles on a birthday cake or tossing a coin down a well, an echo of that wish becomes lodged in a stone buried deep in the earth of the Feywild. Brigganocks seek out these wish stones, discarding the ones that contain wishes of ill intent and keeping those that hold good wishes. Brigganocks refine wish stones into gems and use them to decorate their architecture and crafts, or they trade them to other Fey for food and favors. A more powerful Fey creature can use a wish stone to scry on the maker of the wish, empower a supernatural charm, or provide the spark needed to create an animated object. Other uses are possible as well.": "Brigganocks是一种疯狂的、老鼠大小的生物，生活在矿区。每当一个凡人许下一个非魔法的愿望，也许是在吹灭生日蛋糕上的蜡烛或把硬币扔进井里时，这个愿望的回声就会被埋在深埋在仙境的石头里。布里格诺克人寻找这些愿望石，丢弃那些含有恶意的愿望的石头，保留那些拥有美好愿望的石头。Brigganocks将愿望石提炼成宝石，用来装饰他们的建筑和工艺品，或者用它们与其他费伊人交换食物和好处。一个更强大的费伊生物可以用许愿石来探查许愿者，赋予一个超自然的魅力，或提供创造一个动画物体所需的火花。其他用途也是可能的。",
	"A brigganock's soul lives outside its body, manifesting as a bulb of pale light that floats alongside it and helps the brigganock see in the dark. Brigganocks have minor spellcasting abilities that help them survive. They also have the ability to manipulate time, allowing them to accomplish hour-long tasks in a matter of seconds, though a brigganock must rest between these bursts of temporal acceleration.": "布里格诺克的灵魂生活在它的身体之外，表现为一个漂浮在它身边的淡淡的光球，帮助布里格诺克在黑暗中看到东西。Brigganock有轻微的法术能力，帮助他们生存。他们也有操纵时间的能力，使他们能够在几秒钟内完成长达一小时的任务，尽管在这些时间加速的爆发之间，brigganock必须休息。",
	"Brigganocks like to nibble on cheese, lettuce, and other soft foods. They eat quite a lot for creatures of their size and never turn down a good meal.": "Brigganocks喜欢啃咬奶酪、生菜和其他软性食物。对于它们这种体型的生物来说，它们的食量相当大，而且从不拒绝好的食物。",

	"Campestris are happy-go-lucky mushroom-like creatures with few cares or worries. They are captivated by music, though they can't distinguish a well-played performance from a bad one. If anyone plays an instrument or sings in the campestris' vicinity, the little creatures will happily sing along, each in an obnoxiously nasal falsetto, as they dance and caper around whoever is making the music.": "坎贝斯是一种快乐的蘑菇状生物，几乎没有忧虑或烦恼。它们被音乐所吸引，尽管它们无法区分演奏得好与坏。如果有人在坎特里斯附近演奏乐器或唱歌，这些小动物会很高兴地跟着唱，每个人都用令人讨厌的鼻音假声唱，因为他们在制作音乐的人身边跳舞和奔跑。",
	"Campestris can easily imitate lyrics and music. After a campestri has practiced a song or a piece of music three or four times, the creature remembers it forever.": "坎贝斯提斯能轻易地模仿歌词和音乐。在坎贝斯提斯将一首歌曲或一段音乐练习了三、四次后，这种生物就会永远记住它了。",
	"Campestris vary widely in color, from white to tan to dark brown, but they always have red or purple caps and speckles. A campestri moves by manipulating the mycelium that grows out of the base of its stem and supports it. The mushroom creatures eat salty soil, filter out the salt, and excrete a slippery paste of purified soil (stripped of things nourishing to fungi, of course). Eating salt is also a defense mechanism, because it makes the campestris taste salty and thus unpleasant to most creatures, though bullywugs consider them a delicacy.": "坎培拉的颜色差异很大，从白色到棕褐色到深褐色，但它们总是有红色或紫色的帽子和斑点。坎贝斯特里通过操纵从其茎基部长出并支撑它的菌丝来移动。蘑菇生物吃咸的土壤，过滤掉盐分，并排出一种滑溜溜的净化土壤的糊状物（当然是剥去对真菌有营养的东西）。吃盐也是一种防御机制，因为它使金针菇吃起来很咸，因此对大多数生物来说是不愉快的，尽管霸王菌认为它们是一种美味。",
	"Clapperclaw the scarecrow is 3 feet tall. Created by Granny Nightshade using a tormented child's soul she found in Gehenna, it ran away from home so that it wouldn't have to perform evil tasks for her. After fleeing Thither, Clapperclaw was waylaid by Agdon Longscarf and his harengon brigands, who stole its head, which the scarecrow describes as a most glorious stag skull. It desperately wants its head back, and it's a bit self-conscious about its replacement head: a hollow gourd that now sits askew on its shoulders. Eight copper coins are sealed inside the gourd, causing the head to rattle whenever Clapperclaw nods, turns, or shakes its head.": "稻草人Clapperclaw有3英尺高。它是由夜影婆婆用她在地府发现的一个受折磨的孩子的灵魂创造的，它离家出走，这样它就不必为她执行邪恶的任务。逃到这里后，Clapperclaw被Agdon Longscarf和他的harengon强盗拦截，他们偷走了它的头，稻草人将其描述为一个最光辉的雄鹿头骨。它急切地想要回自己的头，而且它对自己的替代头有点自责：一个空心的葫芦，现在正歪在它的肩膀上。葫芦里封着八枚铜钱，每当爪牙点头、转身或摇头时，头就会发出响声。",

	"Endelyn's obsession with tragedy and hopelessness extends to her own life; she has foreseen her own demise during a solar eclipse.

	"A jabberwock is a solitary, temperamental predator that haunts pristine forests and ancient ruins. Accurate descriptions of jabberwocks are difficult to come by, because the rare survivors of an encounter with one retain only a confused impression of its parts and not a sense of the whole. Pieced-together accounts describe it as a sinewy, dragon-like creature that can walk on its hind legs as easily as it travels on all four. Its eyes can emit fiery beams.": "叽叽喳喳是一种孤独的、喜怒无常的捕食者，在原始森林和古代遗迹中出没。很难有关于叽叽喳喳的准确描述，因为罕见的与叽叽喳喳相遇的幸存者只对它的各个部分保留了混乱的印象，而没有对整体的感觉。拼凑起来的说法是，它是一种有筋骨的、类似龙的生物，可以用后腿行走，就像用四条腿行走一样容易。它的眼睛可以发射出火热的光束。",

The goblin once sought the hag's help in a desperate attempt to undo what she thought was a terrible curse: wherever Jingle Jangle went, she felt a tormenting fear of being caught on the wrong side of a locked door. When she appealed to Bavlorna for aid, the hag removed the goblin's ability to perceive that fear and replaced it with an insatiable and overwhelming need to collect keys. So great is this obsession that Jingle Jangle has lost her own sense of self and now refers to herself only in the third person.": "叮当对钥匙的痴迷对那些想与巴弗洛娜-布莱特斯特劳进行交易的人来说是一个警示故事。这个小妖精曾经不顾一切地寻求女巫的帮助，试图解开她认为可怕的诅咒：无论Jingle Jangle走到哪里，她都感到一种折磨人的恐惧，害怕被锁在门的另一边。当她向巴弗洛娜求助时，巫婆消除了小妖精感知这种恐惧的能力，取而代之的是对收集钥匙的永不满足和压倒性的需求。这种痴迷是如此之大，以至于金戈铁马已经失去了自我意识，现在只用第三人称来称呼自己。",

	"A living doll is easily mistaken for an inanimate doll or a stuffed animal until it moves. Trapped within each living doll is a mean spirit that encourages those around it to behave badly toward others. The doll takes pleasure in tormenting the guilt-ridden and despondent, hastening their descent into depression or paranoia. Because it fears its own destruction, the doll rarely causes direct harm to others. When forced to defend itself, it debilitates opponents with its maniacal cackle and assaults the minds of its enemies by turning their worst fears against them.": "活生生的娃娃很容易被误认为是无生命的娃娃或毛绒动物，直到它动起来。每个活人偶中都有一个卑鄙的灵魂，它鼓励周围的人对他人做出恶劣的行为。娃娃以折磨内疚和绝望的人为乐，加速他们陷入抑郁症或偏执狂。因为它害怕自己的毁灭，娃娃很少直接伤害他人。当被迫自卫时，它就会用疯狂的笑声削弱对手的力量，并通过将敌人最可怕的恐惧转化为对他们的攻击。",

	"Light, formerly known as Urmius Umbrage, belonged to a filthy rich shadar-kai family that haunted a crumbling mansion in Gloomwrought. Although he wanted for nothing as a child, Urmius found himself surrounded by family members, caretakers, and teachers who were uniformly cold, callous, and mean-spirited. He grew tired of being seen as nothing more than the inheritor of the Umbrage estate and legacy, and he did everything in his power to make life miserable for everyone around him, especially his parents.

But Urmius found himself taken aback by Naeryx's ability to find even a small amount of joy in his work. He was eager to get to know Naeryx better, though it took a while for Naeryx to trust him. After getting his hands on some money, Urmius bought a sad little carnival that was camped on the outskirts of Gloomwrought and asked Naeryx to help him run it. For Urmius, the carnival was a chance to emerge from under his family's shadow and become the master of his own fate, but it also meant forsaking his inheritance in order to embrace the unconventional lifestyle, fashions, and friendships he desired.": "乌尔米乌斯在一次家庭晚宴上第一次见到奈瑞克斯-克鲁普尔，起初对这个钟楼看守人没有什么想法。但Urmius发现自己被Naeryx在工作中找到哪怕是一点点快乐的能力吓了一跳。他渴望更好地了解Naeryx，尽管Naeryx花了一些时间来信任他。在拿到一些钱后，乌尔米乌斯买下了一个在格洛姆沃特郊区扎营的悲惨的小嘉年华，并请纳瑞克斯帮助他经营。对乌尔米乌斯来说，嘉年华会是一个机会，让他从家庭的阴影下走出来，成为自己命运的主人，但这也意味着放弃了他的遗产，以接受他所期望的非传统的生活方式、时尚和友谊。",
	"Witch, who used to go by the name Naeryx Krumple, spent his youth as a homeless orphan, eking out a meager and dreary existence on the fog-shrouded streets of Gloomwrought, a city in the Shadowfell. He earned a few coppers selling broadsheets as a young boy, then later swept floors until an old clock tower keeper took him on as a helper.

He owned one fine suit that he wore on such occasions, and though he didn't care for the family's matriarch or patriarch, he enjoyed the company of their eldest son, Urmius Umbrage—a brooding shadar-kai ne'er do-well with a cruel sense of humor. Naeryx and Urmius were close in age and got along well in all respects. Years later, without informing the rest of his family, Urmius bought a run-down carnival and persuaded Naeryx to help him operate it.

	"Gleam and Glister are high elf twins, who until recently performed amazing acts of balance and agility at the Witchlight Carnival. Together, they are known as the Selenelion twins.

	"Gleam and Glister were born during such an event, and they are blessed with magical abilities tied to moonlight (Gleam) and sunlight (Glister), respectively. The twins are easily distinguished by the masks they wear; Gleam wears a crescent moon mask, and Glister wears a sun mask.": "Gleam和Glister就是在这样的事件中出生的，他们分别拥有与月光（Gleam）和阳光（Glister）相联系的神奇能力。这对双胞胎很容易从他们戴的面具中分辨出来；格莱姆戴的是新月面具，而格里斯特戴的是太阳面具。",

The accompanying stat block uses \"she\" and \"her\" as each twin's default pronouns.": "在科里隆的祝福下，这对双胞胎可以在长时间的休息结束后改变自己的性别，尽管其中一个双胞胎很少在另一个不做同样的事情的情况下这样做。随之而来的数据块使用 \"她 \"和 \"她 \"作为每个双胞胎的默认代名词。",

	"Sir Talavar is an esteemed member of the Seelie Court and a loyal vassal of the Summer Queen. Many of Sir Talavar's squires have gone on to become knights of great renown.

	"Skabatha is the oldest member of the Hourglass Coven. Better known as Granny Nightshade, she offers her assistance to those who are haunted by regret.

	"Skabatha assumes the guise of an old toymaker. Part toy herself, she has a windup key between her hunched shoulders that rotates quickly when she's in a good mood and slows down as her mood sours.

	"Skylla is spiteful and treacherous, as likely to betray her allies as to help them. She talked Kelek into allowing her to serve as the primary liaison between the League of Malevolence and the Hourglass Coven, claiming her pact with Baba Yaga made her better suited for the role than anyone else. Endelyn Moongrave foresaw that Skylla's allies would turn on her one day and shared this information with the warlock. Skylla reacted to that news by distancing herself from the League of Malevolence, and now she works for Endelyn. Skylla is open to the idea of rejoining the league, but not while Kelek is in charge.": "斯盖拉是个阴险狡诈的人，背叛她的盟友和帮助他们的可能性一样大。她说服凯雷克允许她担任恶灵联盟和沙漏女巫会之间的主要联络人，声称她与巴巴-雅加的契约使她比其他人更适合这个角色。Endelyn Moongrave预见到Skylla的盟友有一天会背叛她，并把这个信息告诉了术士。斯盖拉对这个消息的反应是与恶灵联盟保持距离，现在她为恩德林工作。Skylla对重新加入联盟的想法持开放态度，但在Kelek掌权时不会。",
	"Originally a nonsentient oilcan, Squirt was carried to the Feywild by dwarves hoping to harvest boggle oil. Though the expedition was a success, the dwarves were put to sleep by pixie magic. During a celebration that erupted around them, an elf used her magic to animate the oilcan in jest. Having come alive at a party, Squirt was imbued with the urge to seek out fun wherever it can be found.": "斯奎特原本是一个无知觉的油罐，被希望收获博格油的矮人带到了仙境。虽然这次探险很成功，但矮人却被小精灵的魔法催眠了。在他们周围爆发的庆祝活动中，一个精灵在开玩笑时用她的魔法将油罐激活了。在派对上活过来后，小松鼠被灌输了一种冲动，无论在哪里都要寻找乐趣。",

He isn't terribly bright, which is why he leaves the plotting and scheming to others.": "沃德克作为一个无情的雇佣杀手，他的服务可以很容易地买到。这个邪恶的剑客不时为凯雷克提供服务，作为同伙和冒险的伙伴。他不是很聪明，这就是为什么他把阴谋和诡计留给别人。",

	"Witchlight hands are the backbone of the Witchlight Carnival, a motley collection of individuals who operate many of the booths, make repairs, feed and exercise the animals, keep an eye out for thieves and other miscreants, and perform other miscellaneous tasks as Mister Witch dictates.

	"All hands enter into an agreement when they join the carnival: they must never harm another staff member, and they can't leave the carnival for more than a day at a time.

Mister Witch and Mister Light also furnish them with small amounts of pixie dust (see appendix A).": "所有的人在加入嘉年华会时都会签订一个协议：他们决不能伤害其他工作人员，而且他们每次离开嘉年华会的时间不能超过一天。(在女巫先生的估计中，更长时间的缺席相当于辞职)。值班的工作人员必须在背上绑着假的蝴蝶翅膀。女巫先生和光明先生还为他们提供少量的精灵尘（见附录A）。",

	"Zargash worships Orcus, the Demon Prince of Undeath, who has promised to transform Zargash into a vampire after a lifetime of faithful service.
