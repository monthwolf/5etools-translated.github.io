{
	"Two women gave life to Strahd von Zarovich. The first was Queen Ravenovia van Roeyen, Strahd's biological mother. The second was the queen's midwife, a devout follower of Mother Night named Baba Lysaga. Although it was the former who raised Strahd and enabled him to follow in his father's footsteps, it was the latter who sensed a potential for greatness and darkness in Strahd surpassing that of any other mortal. Lysaga believed then, as she believes now, that she is Strahd's true mother.": "有两个女人给了斯特拉赫特-冯-扎罗维奇生命。第一个是拉文维娅-范-罗伊恩女王，斯特拉赫特的生母。第二个是女王的助产士，她是夜之母的虔诚追随者，名叫巴巴-莱萨加。虽然是前者养育了斯特拉赫特，使他能够追随父亲的脚步，但却是后者在斯特拉赫特身上感受到了超越其他凡人的伟大和黑暗的潜力。Lysaga当时相信，就像现在一样，她是斯特拉赫特的真正母亲。",
	"When Strahd was still a baby in his crib, Baba Lysaga cast protective spells on him and crept into his nursery on stormy nights to sing magical rhymes to him. She also placed the \"spark of magic\" in him, ensuring that he would become a spellcaster.": "当斯特拉赫特还是个躺在摇篮里的婴儿时，巴巴-莱萨加对他施了保护性的咒语，并在暴风雨的夜晚悄悄进入他的婴儿房，给他唱神奇的儿歌。她还把 \"魔法的火花 \"放在他身上，确保他成为一名施法者。",
	"Baba Lysaga's unhealthy attachment to the baby Strahd did not go unnoticed. After she received several disturbing reports, Queen Ravenovia was forced to banish the midwife from the kingdom. Lysaga never saw Strahd again, but she has succeeded in staying alive to witness the triumphs of her beloved boy, who, in her mind, is eternally blessed. Despite the horrors Strahd has wrought, Lysaga still envisions him as the perfect child she delivered into the world. Strahd is the only thing in her life that matters to her.": "巴巴-利萨加对婴儿斯特拉赫的不健康依恋并没有被忽视。在收到几份令人不安的报告后，拉文维亚女王被迫将这位助产士驱逐出王国。Lysaga再也没有见过斯特拉赫特，但她成功地活了下来，见证了她心爱的男孩的胜利，在她的心目中，男孩是永恒的祝福。尽管斯特拉赫特造成了种种恐怖，但莉萨加仍将他设想为她送入世界的完美孩子。斯特拉赫是她生命中唯一重要的东西。",
	"During her exile, Baba Lysaga made countless sacrifices to Mother Night, pleading with the goddess to afflict Queen Ravenovia with ill health and visit death upon her. Lysaga eventually got her wish, and after Strahd settled in the valley of Barovia, Lysaga moved as close to him as she dared to.": "在流放期间，巴巴-莱萨加向母夜叉做了无数次祭祀，恳求女神让拉文维亚女王健康不佳，并让她死亡。莱萨加最终如愿以偿，斯特拉赫特在巴罗维亚山谷定居后，莱萨加尽可能地靠近他。",
	"In the filth-ridden depths of her heart, Lysaga knows that Strahd would never accept her as his true mother, nor could she bear his rejection. As a result, she has never confronted him. She would rather exist in perpetual denial, whiling away the days, months, and years practicing fell magic and looking for ways to help her \"son.\"": "在污秽不堪的内心深处，Lysaga知道斯特拉赫特永远不会接受她作为他真正的母亲，她也无法忍受他的拒绝。因此，她从来没有面对过他。她宁可永远否认自己的存在，在练习坠落的魔法和寻找帮助她 \"儿子 \"的方法中消磨日月和年华。",
	"Baba Lysaga has allies in Castle Ravenloft - a coven of witches. Through the aid of these witches, Lysaga recently uncovered a potential threat to Strahd: a secret society of wereravens called the Keepers of the Feather, a group that uses ordinary ravens as their spies.": "巴巴-莱萨加在雷文洛夫特城堡有盟友--一个女巫团。通过这些女巫的帮助，Lysaga最近发现了对斯特拉赫特的潜在威胁：一个名为 \"羽毛守护者 \"的狼鸦秘密组织，该组织利用普通乌鸦作为他们的间谍。",
	"Strahd doesn't consider the wereravens a serious threat, but Lysaga has chosen to make them the bane of her existence. After much searching and scrying, she discovered a wereraven refuge at the Wizard of Wines winery (chapter 12), and she has begun to wage war against it. In addition, she has forged an alliance with the mad druids that haunt Yester Hill (chapter 14), convincing them that she gave birth to Strahd, whom the druids consider a god. With the druids on her side, she expects to rid Barovia of its wereraven menace.": "斯特拉特并不认为狼人是一个严重的威胁，但莱萨加却选择将其作为自己生存的祸根。经过大量的搜索和探查，她在酒之精灵酒庄发现了一个狼人的避难所（第12章），她开始对其发动战争。此外，她还与在耶斯特山出没的疯狂德鲁伊结成联盟（第14章），说服他们相信她生下了被德鲁伊视为神的斯特拉赫。有了德鲁伊们的支持，她希望能摆脱巴罗维亚的狼人威胁。",
	"The goddess Mother Night has bestowed magical gifts on Baba Lysaga as rewards for her ceaseless devotion to Strahd. Her skin has the resilience of stone, she is resistant to harmful magic, and she is shielded against divination magic. Mother Night has also imparted to Lysaga the secret of longevity, which requires her to bathe in the blood of beasts on nights of the new moon. Failure to do so causes Lysaga to age rapidly, becoming mere dust and bones in a matter of seconds.": "母夜叉女神将神奇的礼物赐予巴巴-利萨加，作为她对斯特拉赫特无休止的奉献的奖赏。她的皮肤像石头一样有弹性，对有害的魔法有抵抗力，而且对占卜魔法有保护作用。母夜叉还将长寿的秘密传授给莱萨加，这要求她在新月之夜用野兽的血洗澡。如果不这样做，Lysaga就会迅速衰老，在几秒钟内变成灰尘和骨头。",
	"\"No love is greater than a mother's love for her son.\"": "\"没有什么爱能比母亲对儿子的爱更伟大\"。",
	"\"I am the mother of Strahd. Anyone who disputes this fact can rot.\"": "\"我是斯特拉赫特的母亲。任何质疑这一事实的人都可以腐烂。\"",
	"\"I will not rest until the last of my son's enemies are destroyed.\"": "\"直到我儿子的最后一个敌人被消灭，我才会休息。\"",
	"Baba Lysaga built a hut atop the rotting stump of a giant tree that was felled long ago. It was only after she embedded a magic gemstone in the hut that the whole thing was imbued with a semblance of life. When she wills it to do so, the hut pulls its gigantic roots free of the earth and shambles around like a spidery behemoth, shaking the ground with every step. The hut attacks with its flailing and stomping roots. It can also use its roots to fling large rocks.": "巴巴-利萨加在很久以前被砍伐的巨树腐烂的树桩上建造了一座小屋。在她将一颗魔法宝石嵌入小屋后，整个小屋才被赋予了生命的迹象。当她的意志让它这样做时，小屋就会把它巨大的根系从地球上拔出来，像一个蜘蛛般的巨兽一样晃来晃去，每走一步都会摇晃地面。小屋用它甩动和踩踏的根部进行攻击。它还可以用它的根来抛出大石头。",
	"The hut is a 15-foot-square, ramshackle wooden building with a gently sloping thatch roof. Its furnishings have been bolted to the floor, since the hut lurches from side to side when it walks.": "这个小屋是一个15英尺见方的破旧木制建筑，有一个缓缓倾斜的茅草屋顶。它的家具被栓在地板上，因为小屋在行走的时候会左右摇摆。",
	"The gemstone that has given life to Baba Lysaga's hut was previously buried in the Wizard of Wines vineyard. The gem was one of three imbued with life-giving magic that made the grapevines in the vineyard healthier, guaranteeing the finest wines. Baba Lysaga stole one of the gems and perverted its magic, using it instead to animate her wooden hut.": "赋予巴巴-利萨加小屋生命的宝石之前被埋在葡萄酒魔法师的葡萄园里。这颗宝石是被赋予生命魔法的三颗宝石之一，使葡萄园里的葡萄树更加健康，保证了最优质的葡萄酒。巴巴-利萨加偷了其中一颗宝石，并颠覆了它的魔法，用它来激活她的木屋。",
	"The mad women and men known as Barovian witches forge pacts with Strahd and the Dark Powers of Ravenloft in exchange for magic and longevity. They prefer to live in the shadows and can see in the dark. When traveling in the open, they use {@spell alter self} spells to assume less conspicuous forms. They also use these spells to grow long, sharp claws with which they can attack.": "被称为巴罗维亚女巫的疯女人和男人与斯特拉赫和拉文洛夫特的黑暗势力签订契约，以换取魔法和长寿。他们喜欢生活在阴影中，可以在黑暗中看到。当在公开场合旅行时，他们会使用{@spell alter self}法术，以不太显眼的形式出现。他们还使用这些法术来长出长长的、锋利的爪子，用来攻击。",
	"Barovian witches have no scruples. They will deal with anyone in return for power. They will also betray anyone for the same reason. The only thing they fear is Strahd, and his wish is their command. Barovian witches sometimes refer to themselves as the brothers and sisters of Strahd, though never to Strahd's face.": "巴罗维亚的女巫没有任何顾忌。她们会与任何人交易以换取权力。她们也会出于同样的原因背叛任何人。她们唯一害怕的是斯特拉赫，而他的愿望就是她们的命令。巴罗维亚女巫有时称自己为斯特拉赫特的兄弟姐妹，但从不当着斯特拉赫特的面说。",
	" Barovian witches are obsessive collectors, each believing that almost anything found - a piece of broken bone, a dead rodent, a handful of dust, or some other worthless item or substance - could be valuable or useful as a spell component, a ritual object, or a potion ingredient.": " 巴罗维亚的女巫都是痴迷的收藏家，每个人都相信，几乎任何发现的东西--一块碎骨头、一只死老鼠、一把灰尘，或者其他一些不值钱的物品或物质--都可能是有价值的，或者作为法术组件、仪式物品或魔药成分而有用。",
	"Barovian witches use the {@spell find familiar} spell to call forth familiars. They are particularly fond of cats, though snakes and toads are also common. These animals lurk amid the clutter of the witches' lairs, seldom wandering far from their vile masters.": "巴罗维亚女巫使用{@spell find familiar}的咒语来召唤家畜。她们特别喜欢猫，尽管蛇和蟾蜍也很常见。这些动物潜伏在女巫巢穴的杂物中，很少远离它们卑鄙的主人。",
	"A broom of animated attack is easily mistaken for a broom of flying. It attacks any creature that grabs it or tries to ride it.": "动画攻击的扫帚很容易被误认为是飞行的扫帚。它攻击任何抓住它或试图骑它的生物。",
	"Some brooms of animated attack allow their creators to ride them, in which case they behave like typical brooms of flying. A broom of animated attack, however, can carry only half the weight that a broom of flying can (see chapter 7, \"Treasure,\" of the Dungeon Master's Guide).": "有的动画攻击扫帚允许它们的创造者骑着它们，在这种情况下，它们的行为就像典型的飞行扫帚一样。然而，一个动画攻击扫帚只能承载飞行扫帚一半的重量（见《地下城管理员指南》第7章，\"宝物\"）。",
	"Ezmerelda d'Avenir, a Vistana, is the protégé of Rudolph van Richten - despite the fact that her first encounter with the vampire hunter was anything but pleasant.": "Ezmerelda d'Avenir是维斯塔纳人，是鲁道夫-范-里希特的门徒--尽管她与这个吸血鬼猎人的第一次相遇并不愉快。",
	"When Ezmerelda was a little girl, her family kidnapped van Richten's teenage son, Erasmus, and delivered him into the clutches of a vampire. Even today, years later, she can still hear Erasmus's pleas for mercy. That event haunted her childhood.": "当Ezmerelda还是个小女孩的时候，她的家人绑架了范-里希特的十几岁的儿子伊拉斯谟，并把他送到了一个吸血鬼的魔爪下。即使在多年后的今天，她仍能听到伊拉斯谟的求饶声。这一事件困扰着她的童年。",
	"Van Richten tracked down Ezmerelda's family soon after the kidnapping, but not before the Vistani had sold the boy. Though van Richten could have done them harm, he instead interrogated Ezmerelda's mother and father on the whereabouts of his missing son. Satisfied with their answers, he spared their lives before departing with the information they had given him. Ezmerelda witnessed van Richten's act of mercy and was deeply moved by it.": "绑架事件发生后，范里希特很快就找到了埃兹梅勒达的家人，但在维斯塔纳人卖掉男孩之前，他还没有找到。尽管范-里希特本可以对他们造成伤害，但他还是审问了埃兹梅勒达的母亲和父亲，询问他失踪儿子的下落。他对他们的回答感到满意，在带着他们提供的信息离开之前饶了他们一命。埃兹梅勒达目睹了范里希特的仁慈行为，并为之深深感动。",
	"At the age of fifteen, Ezmerelda, still troubled by what her family had done to van Richten, ran away from home. After many harrowing adventures, she tracked down van Richten two years later. Thinking she was a Vistana assassin, he put a sword to her throat and threatened to spill her blood. Ezmerelda convinced him that she genuinely wanted to help him find his missing son, whereupon van Richten told her the saddest of tales. He had found his son, who had been transformed into a vampire spawn. When Erasmus pleaded to his father for salvation, van Richten granted his request by ending his existence.": "十五岁时，埃兹梅勒达仍然为家人对范-里希特的所作所为感到不安，于是离家出走。经过许多痛苦的冒险，两年后她追踪到了范-里希特。他以为她是维斯塔纳的刺客，用剑抵住她的喉咙，威胁要让她流血。埃兹梅勒达说服了他，她真的想帮助他找到失踪的儿子，于是范-里希特向她讲述了一个最悲惨的故事。他已经找到了他的儿子，他已经变成了一个吸血鬼的后代。当伊拉斯谟向他的父亲恳求救赎时，范-里希滕同意了他的请求，结束了他的存在。",
	"Ezmerelda remained by van Richten's side for two years, helping him track down and slay many creatures of the night. But because van Richten could never bring himself to fully trust a Vistana, he kept secrets from her. The two vampire hunters got on each other's nerves, and their arguments became more frequent. At last, Ezmerelda suggested that they part company with some shred of their friendship still intact, and van Richten agreed.": "埃兹梅勒达在范-里希特身边呆了两年，帮助他追踪并杀死了许多夜行生物。但由于范-里希特从来没有完全信任过维斯塔纳，所以他对她保持秘密。这两个吸血鬼猎人彼此都很紧张，他们的争吵变得越来越频繁。最后，Ezmerelda建议他们在友谊保持不变的情况下分道扬镳，范里亨同意了。",
	"Since bidding farewell to van Richten, Ezmerelda has amassed a sizable personal fortune, some of which she used to buy a wagon to carry her vampire-slaying paraphernalia. On one of her less successful adventures, a werewolf bit off her right leg below the knee, and although she avoided being afflicted with lycanthropy, Ezmerelda was sidelined for months. She commissioned a master artisan to craft a prosthetic lower leg and foot. After several tries, he delivered a prosthesis that restored her mobility. She has since adapted well to the false appendage.": "自从告别了范-里希特，埃兹梅勒达积累了一笔可观的个人财富，她用其中的一部分买了一辆马车来运载她的猎杀吸血鬼的用具。在她一次不太成功的冒险中，一个狼人咬断了她膝盖以下的右腿，虽然她避免了被狼人症折磨，但艾兹梅尔达还是被排挤了几个月。她委托一位工匠大师制作一个假肢和脚。经过几次尝试，他交付了一个假肢，恢复了她的活动能力。此后，她很好地适应了这个假的附属装置。",
	"While in the company of a Vistani caravan, Ezmerelda heard a rumor that Rudolph van Richten had gone to Barovia to slay the most powerful vampire of them all. She decided that he might need help and traveled for months to reach Strahd's domain. She rode her wagon to Vallaki and learned about an old tower that seemed the sort of place van Richten would use as a base. When she arrived there, she found some of van Richten's belongings, but of the vampire hunter there was no sign. Although she is anxious to learn the whereabouts of her mentor, she is also eager to earn his trust and respect. To that end, she has been poring over van Richten's research and learning about Strahd and Castle Ravenloft, with every intention of dispatching the vampire herself.": "在维斯坦人商队的陪伴下，埃兹梅勒达听到一个传言，说鲁道夫-范-里希特去巴罗维亚杀死了他们中最强大的吸血鬼。她决定，他可能需要帮助，于是旅行了几个月才到达斯特拉赫特的领地。她骑着马车来到瓦拉基，了解到一座古老的塔，似乎是范-里希特会用来作为基地的那种地方。当她到达那里时，她发现了一些范-里希特的遗物，但没有那个吸血鬼猎人的迹象。虽然她急于了解她的导师的下落，但她也渴望赢得他的信任和尊重。为此，她一直在翻阅范-里希特的研究报告，了解斯特拉赫特和雷文洛夫特城堡的情况，并打算亲手消灭这个吸血鬼。",
	"Ezmerelda keeps a deck of tarokka cards in her wagon (chapter 11, area V1). Although the cards aren't magical, Ezmerelda can use them to perform a card reading for the characters (see chapter 1), like the one that can be performed by Madam Eva.": "Ezmerelda在她的马车上放了一副塔罗卡牌（第11章，V1区）。虽然这些牌没有魔法，但Ezmerelda可以用它们为人物进行读牌（见第1章），就像Eva女士可以进行的那样。",

	"A guardian portrait looks like a finely rendered and beautifully framed work of art, usually depicting someone important in a realistic manner. The picture and its frame are bound with powerful magic and are inseparable.": "监护人画像看起来就像一件渲染精细、装帧精美的艺术品，通常以写实的方式描绘重要人物。这幅画和它的画框被强大的魔法所束缚，不可分割。",
	"When a guardian portrait attacks, the figure in the painting animates and moves as though alive (albeit in two dimensions). The guardian portrait has no effective melee attacks, but it has a repertoire of innate spells that it can cast. When it casts a spell, the figure painted on the canvas makes all the appropriate somatic gestures and verbal incantations for the spell.": "当守护者画像进行攻击时，画中的人物就会像活人一样动起来（尽管是在二维空间）。守护画像没有有效的近战攻击，但它有一套可以施展的先天法术。当它施法时，画布上的人物会做出所有适当的体态动作和口头咒语来施法。",
	"Izek and his sister were born in Vallaki. One morning, their father and their uncle took them fishing on Lake Zarovich. On the way back to town, a dire wolf attacked Izek and bit off his right arm. His father carried Izek back to town while his uncle distracted the beast. His sister ran and hid in the woods and was never seen again.": "伊泽克和他的妹妹出生在瓦拉基。一天早上，他们的父亲和叔叔带他们到扎罗维奇湖钓鱼。在回城的路上，一只可怕的狼袭击了伊泽克，咬掉了他的右臂。他的父亲把伊泽克背回了镇上，而他的叔叔则引开了那只野兽。他的妹妹跑到树林里躲了起来，再也没有人看见。",
	"Unlike his sister, Izek was born without a soul. As time wore on, he forgot his lost sister and learned to cope with his disability.": "与他的姐姐不同，伊泽克出生时没有灵魂。随着时间的推移，他忘记了失去的妹妹，学会了应对自己的残疾。",
	"Izek's parents succumbed to their grief, leaving him an orphan. He became a sociopath. Other children ruthlessly mocked him because of his dead family and his missing arm, but he was a large boy and had no trouble killing them and disposing of their bodies. He was eventually caught in the act and brought to the burgomaster. Instead of punishing the boy for his crimes, Baron Vallakovich pardoned Izek and took him into his home. Izek has been loyal to the burgomaster ever since, enjoying the power of his position and the comforts of his master's mansion. When he isn't enforcing the burgomaster's will, Izek drinks copious amounts of wine.": "伊泽克的父母屈服于他们的悲痛，留下他一个孤儿。他成了一个反社会的人。其他孩子无情地嘲笑他，因为他死去的家人和失去的手臂，但他是个大男孩，毫不费力地杀死他们并处理他们的尸体。他最终被抓了个正着，并被带到了镇长那里。瓦拉科维奇男爵没有惩罚这个男孩的罪行，而是赦免了伊泽克，并把他带到自己家里。从那时起，伊泽克就一直效忠于镇长，享受着他的权力和他主人的豪宅的舒适。当他不执行镇长的意愿时，伊泽克会喝大量的酒。",
	"After years of doing Baron Vallakovich's dirty work, Izek awakened from a drunken stupor one morning to find that he had grown a new arm to replace the one he had lost.": "在为瓦拉科维奇男爵干了多年的脏活后，一天早上，伊泽克从醉酒中醒来，发现自己长出了一只新的手臂，取代了他失去的那只。",
	"The new appendage has barbed spines, elongated fingers, and long nails. He can create fire with the snap of his fiendish fingers and has used the flames to put the fear of the devil in every Vallakian.": "这个新的附属物有倒钩刺，拉长的手指和长指甲。他可以用他那魔鬼般的手指弹奏出火焰，并利用火焰让每个瓦拉几人对魔鬼产生恐惧。",
	"Perhaps more disturbing than his fiendish arm and his murderous nature is Izek's collection of dolls, which he keeps in his bedroom in the burgomaster's mansion. Izek often has dreams of a beautiful young woman, and for years he has forced a local toymaker named Gadof Blinsky to craft dolls in her likeness. The woman is Ireena Kolyana, although Izek doesn't know her name.": "也许比他那恶魔般的手臂和凶残的本性更令人不安的是伊泽克的玩偶收藏，他把这些玩偶放在镇长官邸的卧室里。伊泽克经常梦见一个年轻漂亮的女人，多年来，他强迫当地一个名叫加多夫-布林斯基的玩具商按照她的样子制作玩偶。这个女人就是伊莲娜-科利亚娜，尽管伊泽克不知道她的名字。",
	"Izek has dreams of Ireena. If he spots her, he tries to take her by force to the burgomaster's mansion. If he succeeds, he holds her captive in his bedroom (chapter 5, area N3j). Unknown to Izek and Ireena, they are brother and sister. Ireena fled after Izek was attacked by the dire wolf and became lost in the woods. She wandered for days in shock until she was found and adopted by Kolyan Indirovich in the village of Barovia. Izek covets her in an unwholesome way and won't allow anyone or anything to come between them.": "伊泽克梦见了伊丽娜。如果他发现了她，他就试图用武力把她带到镇长的豪宅里。如果他成功了，他就把她囚禁在自己的卧室里（第五章，N3j区）。伊泽克和伊丽娜不知道，他们是兄妹。伊雷娜在伊泽克被地狼袭击后逃离，并在森林中迷路。她在惊恐中徘徊了好几天，直到她被发现并被巴罗维亚村的科莱恩-因迪罗维奇收养。伊泽克以一种不健康的方式觊觎着她，不允许任何人或任何东西介入他们之间。",

	"Over four hundred years ago, Katarina came to Barovia and insinuated herself into Strahd's court, working as a maid in Castle Ravenloft. She came to know the castle like the back of her hand, and she was present for the wedding of Sergei and Tatyana. After Strahd went mad and murdered his brother, she fled the castle and took refuge with the Vistani. Later, she forged a pact with the goddess Mother Night, trading her youth for the power to undo the evil that Strahd had wrought. Mother Night transformed Katarina into an ageless crone gifted with the power of magical foresight. In the guise of Madam Eva, she uses this ability to help Strahd. She can send her Vistani out in their wagons to visit other worlds and bring adventurers to Strahd's domain, in hopes that they will find a way to destroy the vampire or set Strahd free.": "四百多年前，卡塔琳娜来到巴罗维亚，潜入斯特拉赫特的宫廷，在拉文洛夫特城堡做女仆。她对这座城堡了如指掌，谢尔盖和塔季扬娜的婚礼她也在场。在斯特拉赫特发疯并谋杀了他的兄弟后，她逃离了城堡，并在维斯坦尼人那里避难。后来，她与母夜叉女神签订了契约，用自己的青春换取消除斯特拉赫特所造成的邪恶的力量。夜之母将卡塔琳娜变成了一个不老的老妪，她拥有神奇的预知能力。她以伊娃夫人的身份，利用这种能力来帮助斯特拉赫特。她可以派她的维斯坦尼乘坐马车去访问其他世界，把冒险者带到斯特拉赫特的领地，希望他们能找到消灭吸血鬼或释放斯特拉赫特的方法。",

	"Mongrelfolk are humanoids that have undergone, or whose ancestors underwent, horrific magical transformations, to the extent that they retain only a fraction of their original being. Their humanoid bodies incorporate the features of various beasts. For example, one mongrelfolk might have the basic body shape of a dwarf with a head that combines the features of a cat and a lizard, one arm that ends in a crab's pincer, and one leg that ends in a cloven hoof. Another might have the skin and horns of a cow, the eyes of a spider, frog's legs, and a scaly lizard's tail. Each mongrelfolk's mad combination of humanoid and animal forms results in its having a slow, awkward gait.": "Mongrelfolk是经历了或其祖先经历了可怕的魔法改造的人形生物，以至于他们只保留了原来的一小部分。他们的人形身体融合了各种野兽的特征。例如，一个混血儿可能具有矮人的基本体形，头部结合了猫和蜥蜴的特征，一只手臂末端是螃蟹的钳子，一条腿末端是蹄子。另一个可能有牛的皮肤和角，蜘蛛的眼睛，青蛙的腿和有鳞蜥蜴的尾巴。每个混血儿都是人形和动物形的疯狂组合，导致其拥有缓慢、笨拙的步态。",
	"Mongrelfolk have misshapen mouths and vocal cords. They speak fragmented Common mixed with various animal cries and nonsense. They can effectively imitate sounds made by beasts and humanoids that they've heard. Mongrelfolk aren't sophisticated enough to use these sounds as a covert form of communication, but they can use the sounds to lure enemies into a trap or otherwise distract them.": "蒙古人的嘴和声带都是错位的。他们说的是混合着各种动物叫声和胡言乱语的零散的普通话。他们可以有效地模仿他们所听到的野兽和人形动物的声音。蒙古人还没有成熟到可以用这些声音作为秘密的交流方式，但他们可以用这些声音来引诱敌人进入陷阱或以其他方式分散他们的注意力。",
	"Mongrelfolk are seldom welcome in other humanoid societies, where they are abused, enslaved, or shunned. They typically live on the fringes of civilization in ruins, deserted buildings, or other places that other humanoid races once lived in or built. They tend to be timid and skittish outside their homes and fiercely territorial within their lairs.": "蒙古人很少受到其他类人社会的欢迎，他们在那里被虐待、被奴役或被回避。他们通常生活在文明的边缘，在废墟、荒废的建筑或其他人形种族曾经居住或建造的地方。它们在外面往往胆小怕事，在巢穴里则有很强的领地意识。",
	"It's possible to restore a mongrel-folk to its original form using a {@spell greater restoration} spell, but the same can't be said for a mongrelfolk's offspring. Only mongrelfolk that are made by magic can be restored to their original forms. Mongrelfolk that are born are true mongrelfolk and not the subjects of a spell or an effect that can be undone.": "使用{@spell greater restoration}的法术可以将一个杂种民兵恢复到它的原始形态，但对于杂种民兵的后代就不一样了。只有由魔法制造的杂种民兵才能恢复原状。出生的蒙古人是真正的蒙古人，而不是法术或效果的对象，可以被撤销。",

	"Although one is often mistaken for a ghost, a phantom warrior isn't bound by a yearning to complete some unresolved goal. It can choose to end its undead existence at any time. Its spirit lingers willingly, either out of loyalty to its former master or because it believes it must perform a task to satisfy its honor or sense of duty. For example, a guard who dies defending a wall might return as a phantom warrior and continue guarding the wall, then disappear forever once a new guard assumes its post or the wall is destroyed. The period between the time it died and the time it rises as a phantom warrior is usually 24 hours.": "虽然经常被误认为是鬼魂，但幻影战士并不被完成某些未完成的目标的渴望所束缚。它可以在任何时候选择结束其不死的存在。它的灵魂心甘情愿地停留在这里，要么是出于对前主人的忠诚，要么是认为它必须执行一项任务以满足其荣誉感或责任感。例如，一个死于守卫城墙的卫兵可能会以幽灵战士的身份回来，继续守卫城墙，一旦有新的卫兵上任或城墙被毁，就会永远消失。从它死亡到它作为幻影武士复活的时间通常是24小时。",
	"Although they are incorporeal, phantom warriors can harness the energy around them to deflect incoming attacks and strike with great force. An {@condition invisible} sheath of energy surrounds a phantom warrior's ghostly armor, shields, and weapons, which become as hard as steel yet don't impede the warrior's ability to move through walls and other solid objects.": "虽然他们是无体的，但幽灵战士可以利用他们周围的能量来抵御来袭的攻击，并以强大的力量进行攻击。幽灵战士的幽灵盔甲、盾牌和武器周围有一个{@condition invisible}的能量鞘，它们变得像钢铁一样坚硬，但并不妨碍战士穿过墙壁和其他固体物体的能力。",
	"A phantom warrior doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "幻影战士不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"After her husband died in battle, Duchess Dorfniya Dilisnya set her sights on becoming Count Strahd von Zarovich's bride, but she failed to win his love. Her visits to the castle were nonetheless frequent, and she never traveled without her fool, the delightful Pidlwick. The little man was like a ray of sunshine in Castle Ravenloft, and though he failed to amuse Strahd, he delighted Tatyana and Sergei with his jokes and gambols. As a result, Strahd didn't object whenever Pidlwick and the duchess came to visit.": "丈夫战死后，多夫尼亚-迪利斯尼亚公爵夫人把目光投向了斯特拉赫特-冯-扎罗维奇伯爵的新娘，但她没能赢得他的爱。不过，她还是经常去城堡，而且她旅行时从不带着她的傻瓜--可爱的皮德维克。这个小家伙就像雷文洛夫特城堡里的一缕阳光，虽然他没能逗乐斯特拉赫特，但他的笑话和赌博让塔季扬娜和谢尔盖很高兴。因此，每当皮德威克和公爵夫人来拜访时，斯特拉赫特都不会反对。",
	"Eager to please and desiring to return the courtesy, the duchess commissioned the legendary toymaker Fritz von Weerg to build a clockwork effigy of Pidlwick as a gift for Strahd's family. Although the duchess's heart was in the right place, the effigy didn't have Pidlwick's abilities, and it failed to entertain anyone. Even though Pidlwick himself had spent months training it, the effigy couldn't speak, and its movements were more awkward than amusing.": "公爵夫人急于取悦并希望得到回报，她委托传奇的玩具制造商弗里茨-冯-韦格制作了一个皮德威克的发条雕像，作为送给斯特拉赫特家族的礼物。虽然公爵夫人的心思是对的，但这个雕像没有皮德威克的能力，也没能取悦任何人。尽管皮德威克本人花了几个月的时间来训练它，但这个雕像不会说话，它的动作也很笨拙而不有趣。",
	"A harsh winter trapped the duchess, her fool, and her fool's effigy in Castle Ravenloft for several months. The duchess subsequently succumbed to illness, after which Tatyana asked Pidlwick to remain at Castle Ravenloft.": "一个严酷的冬天将公爵夫人、她的傻子和她的傻子的遗像困在了雷文洛夫特城堡几个月。公爵夫人后来病倒了，之后塔季扬娜要求皮德威克留在雷文洛夫特城堡。",
	"Von Weerg was no ordinary toymaker, and he put a little of himself into all his creations, which is to say his works had a touch of their creator's madness. Pidlwick II knew that it had no purpose as long as Pidlwick remained in Castle Ravenloft, so it pushed Pidlwick down a long flight of stairs, killing him. Everyone else thought it was an accident. In the days that followed, Pidlwick II tried its best to fill its namesake's shoes, but the effigy's mere presence was upsetting to Tatyana, and it was never called on to perform. Eventually, it was shut away like a discarded toy.": "冯-威格不是普通的玩具制造商，他在所有的作品中都融入了自己的影子，也就是说，他的作品带有创作者的疯狂气息。皮德威克二世知道，只要皮德威克留在雷文洛夫特城堡，它就没有任何意义，所以它把皮德威克推下长长的楼梯，杀死了他。其他人都认为这是一个意外。在随后的日子里，皮德威克二世尽力填补它的名字的空缺，但这个雕像的存在让塔蒂亚娜感到不安，它从未被召唤去表演。最终，它像一个被丢弃的玩具一样被关了起来。",
	"Pidlwick II was kept in a small closet adjacent to one of the guest bedrooms. On rare occasions when someone stayed there, Pidlwick would sneak out of the closet in the middle of the night, smother the guest with a pillow, and then retreat back to the closet. The castle staff never considered that the effigy might be responsible, instead assuming that the guests had died in their sleep.": "皮德威克二世被关在与其中一间客卧相邻的小壁橱里。在极少数情况下，当有人住在那里时，皮德威克会在半夜从壁橱里溜出来，用枕头闷死客人，然后退回到壁橱里。城堡的工作人员从来没有考虑过这个雕像可能是负责任的，而是认为客人是在睡梦中死去的。",
	"But Strahd was not fooled. He came to realize fairly quickly that the clockwork effigy had begun to display a murderous nature. Rather than have Pidlwick II destroyed, Strahd kept the fool around to dispose of irksome guests from time to time.": "但斯特拉赫特并没有被愚弄。他很快就意识到，这个发条雕像已经开始显示出杀人的本性。斯特拉特没有把皮德威克二世毁掉，而是把这个傻瓜留在身边，不时地处理一些不愉快的客人。",
	"After the deaths of Sergei and Tatyana, the castle became virtually abandoned, and there were no more guests for Pidlwick II to \"entertain.\" The clockwork effigy emerged from its closet and found new places to hide. It fears Strahd and eagerly follows anyone who gives it the attention it craves.": "谢尔盖和塔季扬娜死后，城堡几乎被遗弃，不再有客人供皮德威克二世 \"招待 \"了。钟表雕像从柜子里走出来，找到了新的藏身之处。它害怕斯特拉赫特，并热切地追随任何给它以关注的人。",
	"Pidlwick II is basically an oversized toy - a 4-foot-tall mechanism stuffed with gears, springs, and other components expertly fitted together to impart a semblance of life to it. Its skin is made of stitched leather pulled taut over an articulated wooden frame. Pidlwick II has rubbed soot around its eyes and mouth, giving it the triangular eyes and jagged grin of a jack-o'-lantern.": "皮德威克二世基本上是一个超大的玩具--一个4英尺高的机械装置，里面塞满了齿轮、弹簧和其他部件，它们被巧妙地安装在一起，给它带来了一种生命的感觉。它的皮肤是由缝制的皮革绷紧在一个铰接的木制框架上制成的。皮德威克二世在它的眼睛和嘴巴周围抹上了烟灰，使它具有三角眼和锯齿状的笑脸，就像一个千斤顶。",

	"Rahadin was exiled for refusing to bow down to a dusk elf prince whom he considered weak and corrupt. When the dusk elves later declined to pay fealty to King Barov, Rahadin helped Barov conquer them. The elf kingdom's royal line was obliterated, the dusk elves hunted like rabbits. The few that survived were either subjugated or forced to live among the Vistani. So pleased was Barov with Rahadin that the king made the dusk elf an honorary member of his family.": "拉哈丁因为拒绝向他认为软弱和腐败的黄昏精灵王子低头而被流放。当黄昏精灵后来拒绝向巴罗夫国王宣誓效忠时，拉哈丁帮助巴罗夫征服了他们。精灵王国的王室血统被消灭了，黄昏精灵像兔子一样被猎杀。少数幸存下来的人要么被征服，要么被迫生活在维斯坦尼人中间。巴罗夫对拉哈丁非常满意，国王让黄昏精灵成为他家族的荣誉成员。",
	"After Barov died, Rahadin continued to fight as one of Strahd's generals. When the wars ended and Strahd turned his attention to building Castle Ravenloft, Rahadin saw to it that wizards and artisans were brought to Barovia. Years later, Strahd appointed Rahadin his castle chamberlain. Rahadin was pleased to do whatever Strahd asked of him, and he instilled terror in the castle staff by routinely flogging those who didn't perform their duties to his exacting standards.": "巴罗夫死后，拉哈丁作为斯特拉赫特的将军之一继续战斗。战争结束后，斯特拉赫特将注意力转移到建造雷文洛夫特城堡上，拉哈丁负责将巫师和工匠带到巴罗维亚。多年后，斯特拉赫特任命拉哈丁为他的城堡侍从。拉哈丁很乐意做斯特拉赫特要求他做的任何事情，他经常鞭打那些没有按照他的严格标准履行职责的人，给城堡里的工作人员带来恐惧。",
	"When a dusk elf named Patrina Velikovna came knocking on Strahd's door, Rahadin could see that she intrigued Strahd, but Rahadin was suspicious of her motives. Patrina tried to seduce Strahd with the prospect of immortality - something Strahd desired above all. She told him of a vault of forbidden lore called the Amber Temple, where the secret of gaining immortality was hidden. While Strahd was off exploring the temple, Rahadin handled all of his master's affairs and began searching for a woman who could tear Strahd away from Patrina Velikovna. In this task, he failed. His goal was fulfilled, however, when Sergei, Strahd's brother, found Tatyana.": "当一个名叫帕特里娜-维利科夫娜的黄昏精灵来敲斯特拉赫特的门时，拉哈丁看得出她对斯特拉赫特很感兴趣，但拉哈丁却对她的动机产生了怀疑。帕特里娜试图用长生不老的前景勾引斯特拉赫特--这是斯特拉赫特最渴望的东西。她告诉他，有一个名为琥珀神殿的禁忌传说库，里面藏有获得不朽的秘密。当斯特拉赫特去探索神庙时，拉哈丁处理了他主人的所有事务，并开始寻找一个能将斯特拉赫特从帕特里娜-维利科夫娜身边带走的女人。在这项任务中，他失败了。然而，当斯特拉赫特的弟弟谢尔盖找到塔季扬娜时，他的目标就实现了。",
	"Tatyana was Strahd's type - a woman of exquisite beauty and gentle manner. When Strahd returned to Ravenloft, the young woman instantly caught his eye, and Rahadin had the pleasure of informing Patrina that her presence at the castle was no longer desired.": "塔蒂亚娜是斯特拉赫特喜欢的类型--一个有着精致的美貌和温柔的女人。当斯特拉赫特回到雷文洛夫特时，这位年轻女子立刻引起了他的注意，拉哈丁很高兴地通知帕特里娜，不再需要她留在城堡里了。",
	"Rahadin's loyalty didn't waver after Tatyana died and Strahd became a vampire. Rahadin continued to do his master's bidding. Eager to put Tatyana out of his mind, Strahd lured more women to the castle, taking several of them as brides before draining their lives and turning them into vampire spawn.

	"Patrina Velikovna and her people were living among the Vistani when they heard of Tatyana's death and Strahd's curse. The ageless Patrina returned to Ravenloft in the hope of winning Strahd's love. This time, it was clear that Patrina craved Strahd's power and that Strahd would never love her. Rahadin assumed that Patrina would suffer the same fate as those women who had come before her. He was proven wrong when Patrina's own people stoned her to death to keep Strahd from claiming her as his wife.": "帕特里娜-维利科夫娜和她的族人听说塔季扬娜的死和斯特拉赫特的诅咒时，正生活在维斯坦尼族中。不老的帕特里娜回到了雷文洛夫特，希望能赢得斯特拉赫特的爱。这一次，很明显，帕特丽娜渴望得到斯特拉赫特的力量，而斯特拉赫特绝不会爱她。拉哈丁认为帕特里娜将遭受与她之前的那些女人一样的命运。事实证明他错了，帕特丽娜的族人用石头砸死了她，不让斯特拉赫特娶她为妻。",
	"Strahd was upset that the dusk elves had taken Patrina from him. After securing her body and entombing it in the catacombs of Ravenloft, Strahd sent Rahadin to punish the dusk elves.

	"The half-elf ringmaster is, in fact, a legendary human vampire hunter named Rudolph van Richten. Van Richten's tale is a sad one. A scholar and doctor from a land called Darkon, he married his childhood sweetheart, Ingrid, and together they had a son, Erasmus. When he was fourteen, Erasmus was stolen away by Vistani and sold to a vampire named Baron Metus to be used as a companion. By the time van Richten found his son, it was too late: the baron had already transformed Erasmus into a vampire spawn. Erasmus begged his father to end his suffering, which van Richten did by pounding a wooden stake through his son's chest. Baron Metus avenged that deed by killing van Richten's wife, and van Richten has lived with the horror of his family's destruction ever since. After destroying Baron Metus in turn, van Richten sought revenge against the Vistani and took up a life of hunting evil monsters.": "这个半精灵环形使者实际上是一个传奇的人类吸血鬼猎人，名叫鲁道夫-范-里希滕。范里希特的故事是一个悲惨的故事。他是来自一个叫Darkon的地方的学者和医生，他娶了他的青梅竹马英格丽，他们一起有一个儿子，伊拉斯谟。当他14岁时，伊拉斯谟被维斯坦尼人偷走，并被卖给了一个名叫梅图斯男爵的吸血鬼，作为伴侣使用。当范-里希特找到他的儿子时，已经太晚了：男爵已经把伊拉斯谟变成了一个吸血鬼的卵子。伊拉斯谟乞求他的父亲结束他的痛苦，而范-里希特则用木桩击穿了他儿子的胸部。梅图斯男爵为报此仇，杀死了范-里希特的妻子，此后范-里希特一直生活在家庭毁灭的恐怖之中。在反过来消灭了梅图斯男爵后，范-里希特寻求对维斯坦尼人的报复，并开始了猎杀邪恶怪物的生活。",
	"Van Richten isn't a young man anymore. He knows his road is coming to an end, but his work isn't done. He has come to Barovia to kill Strahd von Zarovich, the greatest vampire of them all. Van Richten has studied Strahd for years and knows he can't hope to best the vampire in a straight-up confrontation: he must wait for the right moment to strike. He has good evidence to suggest that Strahd periodically hibernates in his coffin, sometimes for years, when all is quiet in the realm. While he bides his time, van Richten hides in plain sight with the aid of a hat of disguise, his thoughts protected by a ring of mind shielding. He is trying to learn more about the Keepers of the Feather - a society of wereravens that oppose Strahd - while trying not to expose the secret society to their mutual enemy. He thinks the wereravens might prove helpful when the time comes. Van Richten also wants to take out as many of Strahd's spies as he can, starting with evil Vistani.": "范里亨不再是个年轻人了。他知道自己的路即将走完，但他的工作还没有完成。他来到巴罗维亚是为了杀死斯特拉赫特-冯-扎罗维奇，最伟大的吸血鬼。范-里希特研究斯特拉赫特多年，知道他不可能希望在直接对抗中战胜吸血鬼：他必须等待合适的时机出击。他有充分的证据表明，斯特拉赫特会定期在他的棺材里冬眠，有时甚至长达数年，此时王国里一切都很平静。在等待时机的同时，范-里希特借助一顶伪装帽隐藏在众目睽睽之下，他的思想被一枚心灵屏蔽戒指保护起来。他试图更多地了解 \"羽毛守护者\"--一个反对斯特拉赫的狼人社团--同时尽量不把这个秘密社团暴露给他们共同的敌人。他认为在时机成熟时，狼人可能会有帮助。范里亨还想尽可能多地干掉斯特拉赫特的间谍，首先是邪恶的维斯坦尼。",

It can open its gaping, tooth-filled mouth and bite a creature caught in its roots. The roots of a tree blight can be severed, though cutting them causes the blight no harm.": "一种树瘟以温血猎物为食，以造成大屠杀为乐。它用沉重的树枝进行攻击，用树根将猎物压死。它可以张开它那张满是牙齿的大嘴，咬住夹在它根部的生物。枯萎树的根部可以被切断，尽管切断它们不会对枯萎树造成伤害。",
	"A tree blight will often fight alongside other kinds of blights, but it hates other tree blights and will attack them given the chance. Tree blights also hate treants, and the feeling is mutual.": "树疫病经常与其他种类的疫病并肩作战，但它憎恨其他树疫病，只要有机会就会攻击它们。树疫病人也讨厌树人，这种感觉是相互的。",
	"Vladimir Horngaard joined the Order of the Silver Dragon at a young age and quickly earned the friendship of its founder, the silver dragon Argynvost. When he became a knight of the order, he traveled to distant lands to wage war against the forces of evil. The dragon stayed home and, in the guise of a human noble named Lord Argynvost, brought new initiates into the order.": "弗拉迪米尔-霍恩加德在年轻时就加入了银龙骑士团，并很快赢得了其创始人银龙阿金沃斯特的友谊。当他成为骑士团的一员时，他前往遥远的土地向邪恶势力开战。这条龙留在家里，以人类贵族的身份，名为Argynvost勋爵，将新的入门者带入骑士团。",
	"Vladimir found himself fighting Strahd's armies time and again as they swept across the land. When it became clear that Strahd couldn't be stopped, the knights of the order led hundreds of refugees to Argynvost's valley, but Strahd tracked them to their sanctuary and overwhelmed them with a vast force. Vladimir, whom Argynvost had made a field commander, couldn't hold back the evil tide and was killed, only after the heartbreak of witnessing Strahd himself slay Vladimir's beloved, his fellow knight Sir Godfrey Gwilym. With the battle won, Strahd surrounded Argynvostholt. Rather than cower in his lair, Argynvost emerged and battled Strahd's armies to the bitter end.": "当斯特拉赫特的军队横扫大地时，弗拉基米尔发现自己一次又一次地与他们作战。当斯特拉赫显然无法被阻止时，骑士团的骑士们带领数百名难民来到阿尔金沃斯特的山谷，但斯特拉赫追踪到了他们的避难所，并以巨大的力量压倒了他们。Argynvost任命的弗拉基米尔（Vladimir）为战地指挥官，但他没能挡住邪恶的浪潮，在目睹斯特拉赫特亲手杀死弗拉基米尔的爱人、他的同僚骑士戈弗雷-格威林（Godfrey Gwilym）爵士后，才心碎身亡。随着战斗的胜利，斯特拉赫特包围了阿金沃斯霍尔特。阿金沃斯特没有缩在自己的巢穴里，而是出现了，与斯特拉赫特的军队战斗到最后。",
	"Unwilling to accept his failure, Vladimir returned as a revenant. So great was his hatred of Strahd and his thirst for vengeance that those feelings fueled the spirits of many of his fellow knights - including Godfrey - to come back as revenants as well. Vladimir continued to wage the hopeless war, even as Strahd tightened his grip on the valley.": "由于不愿意接受失败，弗拉基米尔作为复仇者回来了。他对斯特拉赫特的憎恨和对复仇的渴望是如此强烈，以至于他的许多同伴--包括戈弗雷--的精神也被激发出来，成为复仇者回来。弗拉基米尔继续发动这场无望的战争，甚至在斯特拉赫加紧对山谷的控制时也是如此。",
	"When Strahd became a vampire, Vladimir and his revenants should have gone to their eternal rest. But Strahd's deeds were so heinous that Barovia and the knight's spirits became trapped behind curtains of mist.": "当斯特拉赫特成为吸血鬼时，弗拉基米尔和他的复仇者们本应进入永恒的休息。但斯特拉赫特的行为是如此令人发指，以至于巴罗维亚和骑士的灵魂都被困在了迷雾的幕后。",
	" Vladimir hates Strahd but doesn't want to see the vampire given his final rest. Vladimir wants Strahd to suffer forever for the deaths of Godfrey and Argynvost, the destruction of their order, and all the other crimes of which the vampire is guilty. Vladimir believes that all of Barovia has been swept into hell, and he wants to make sure that Strahd stays trapped in it forever. It angers Vladimir that he and his fellow knights are also trapped, but in Vladimir's mind, such is the price of keeping the vampire confined. Even his love for Godfrey is now just a dim memory shrouded by his hate.": " 弗拉迪米尔憎恨斯特拉赫特，但不希望看到吸血鬼得到最后的安息。弗拉迪米尔希望斯特拉赫特为戈弗雷和阿尔金沃斯特的死亡、为他们的秩序的破坏以及为这个吸血鬼所犯的所有其他罪行而永远受罪。弗拉基米尔认为，整个巴罗维亚已经被卷进了地狱，他想确保斯特拉赫特永远被困在地狱里。让弗拉基米尔感到愤怒的是，他和他的同伴们也被困住了，但在弗拉基米尔的心目中，这就是禁锢吸血鬼的代价。即使是他对戈弗雷的爱，现在也只是被他的仇恨所笼罩的一个模糊的记忆。",
	"Were Vladimir to let go of his hatred, his spirit would find peace and could remember the warmth of love. Were Strahd to be defeated, even temporarily, the mists surrounding Barovia would fade, allowing the spirits of Vladimir and his knights to enter the afterlife. Nevertheless, Vladimir would rather savor Strahd's torment than bring peace to his fallen order or peace to the land of Barovia. Gone are the days of honor and valor.": "如果弗拉基米尔能放下仇恨，他的灵魂就会得到安宁，并能记住爱的温暖。如果斯特拉赫被打败，哪怕是暂时的，巴罗维亚周围的迷雾也会消散，让弗拉基米尔和他的骑士们的灵魂进入来世。然而，弗拉基米尔宁愿品尝斯特拉赫特的折磨，也不愿给他的堕落教团带来和平，也不愿给巴罗维亚的土地带来和平。荣誉和勇气的日子已经过去了。",

	"A revenant forms from the soul of a mortal who met a cruel and undeserving fate. It claws its way back into the world to seek revenge against the one who wronged it. The revenant reclaims its mortal body and superficially resembles a zombie. However, instead of lifeless eyes, a revenant's eyes burn with resolve and flare in the presence of its adversary. If the revenant's original body was destroyed or is otherwise unavailable, the spirit of the revenant enters another humanoid corpse. Regardless of the body the revenant uses as a vessel, its adversary always recognizes the revenant for what it truly is.": "一个复仇者从一个遭遇残酷和不值得的命运的凡人的灵魂中形成。它张牙舞爪地回到这个世界上，寻找对它不利的人进行报复。复仇者重新获得其凡人的身体，表面上看与僵尸相似。然而，复仇者的眼睛不是毫无生气的，而是燃烧着决心，在其对手面前耀武扬威。如果复仇者原来的身体被摧毁或无法使用，复仇者的灵魂会进入另一具人形尸体。无论复仇者用什么身体作为容器，它的对手总是能认出复仇者的真面目。",
	"A revenant has only one year to exact revenge. When its adversary dies, or if the revenant fails to kill its adversary before its time runs out, it crumbles to dust and its soul fades into the afterlife. If its foe is too powerful for the revenant to destroy on its own, it seeks worthy allies to help it fulfill its quest.": "复仇者只有一年的时间来进行报复。当它的对手死亡时，或者如果复仇者未能在它的时间结束前杀死它的对手，它就会化为尘土，其灵魂消逝在来世。如果它的敌人过于强大，复仇者无法独自消灭，它就会寻找有价值的盟友来帮助它完成任务。",
	"No magic can hide a creature pursued by a revenant, which always knows the direction and distance between it and the target of its vengeance. In cases where the revenant seeks revenge against more than one adversary, it pursues them one at a time, starting with the creature that dealt it the killing blow. If the revenant's body is destroyed, its soul flies forth to seek out a new corpse in which to resume its hunt.": "任何魔法都无法掩盖被复仇者追捕的生物，复仇者总是知道它和它的复仇目标之间的方向和距离。如果复仇者要向一个以上的对手复仇，它会一次追击一个，从给它致命一击的生物开始。如果复仇者的身体被摧毁，它的灵魂就会飞去寻找一具新的尸体来继续它的狩猎。",

The glowing green gem is contained in a cavity in the stump, beneath the rotted floorboards of the hut. The floorboards can be ripped up with a successful DC 14 Strength check or smashed by dealing 10 damage to them. Once the floorboards are out of the way, a creature can reach into the cavity and snatch the gem. But if someone attempts this while the hut is alive, the cavity sprouts wooden teeth, becoming a mouth that bites anything that tries to remove the gem; a creature trying to remove the gem must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw.
