	"Ashsnakes are huge monstrosities which resemble snakes molded from volcanic magma. Their bodies seeth with an internal heat below the charcoal-gray scales that cover their forms. While the blazing light emanating from their empty eye sockets makes it appear as though ashsnakes can see, they rely entirely on vibrations to assess their surroundings.": "灰蛇(Ashsnakes)是巨大的怪物，它们看起来像是由火山岩浆塑造成的蛇。它们的身体在覆盖着炭灰色鳞片下充满内部热量。虽然从它们空洞的眼眶中散发出的炽热光芒让人觉得灰蛇能看见，但它们完全依赖振动来评估周围环境。",
	"Little is known about the origins of the ashsnake. They recently emerged from beneath the ashen plains of the Scorched Grove and appear to have an insatiable hunger. Ashnakes use the mounds of ash and dust in the Grove to conceal their presence, allowing them to close in on unwary prey and ambush them. While not particularly intelligent, ashsnakes possess predatorial cunning and survival instincts eerily reminiscent of the fauna that inhabited the Grove before its burning.": "关于灰蛇的起源知之甚少。它们最近从焦热树林下的灰烬平原中出现，似乎有着无法满足的饥饿。灰蛇利用树林中的灰尘和灰烬堆来隐藏自己的存在，让它们能够悄无声息地接近毫不警惕的猎物并伏击它们。虽然并不特别聪明，灰蛇具有猎食的狡猾和生存本能，令人不禁联想到树林在燃烧前所栖息的动物。",
	"Ashsnakes have no ability to detect sights and sounds in a traditional sense. They are, however, adept at sensing even the smallest vibration, and the slightest footfall is enough to draw their attention. Some scholars believe it may be possible to \"disappear\" from an ashsnakes \"vision\" by standing perfectly still, but finding volunteers to confirm this theory has under-standably proven difficult.": "灰蛇们没有传统意义上的视听能力。然而，它们擅长感知即使是最微小的振动，即便是最轻微的脚步声也足以引起它们的注意。一些学者认为，通过保持完全静止，可能有可能在灰蛇的“视野”中“消失”，但是找到志愿者来证实这个理论显然是困难的。",

The aspect is not only a creature of heat and energy, but also of destruction and rage, and it appears to draw strength from the forests its flames consume.": "火焰之面是一个火元素生物，由火焰和熔岩组成，其巨大的身躯很容易被误认为是一座小山。这个面不仅是热量和能量的生物，还代表着毁灭和愤怒，它似乎从它所吞噬的森林中汲取力量。",
	"A creature of legend, it is believed by some that this was the \"being of fire and destruction\" said to have caused the Great Calamity that created the Scorched Grove many centuries ago. The aspect possesses frightening power, enough to cause serious harm to the Wood and all those who inhabit it. Long has it been forgotten that the creature was conjured in a lost ritual. Shortly afterwards, it was sealed away beneath the Scorched Grove where its presence has continued to affect the region. Centuries of dormancy have weakened the aspect, as its essence has seeped into the surrounding land. Since being released, it has begun to amass power for itself by consuming plants, trees, and other living beings in flame. Once it attains enough energy to completely break the mystical fetters that tie it to the Scorched Grove, it will be an unstoppable force that could very well bring fiery ruin to all of Humblewood.": "传说中的生物，有人相信这就是几个世纪前造成焦林大灾难的“火焰与毁灭之物”。这个存在拥有令人恐惧的力量，足以对焦林和所有居民造成严重伤害。人们早已忘记这个生物是在一个失传的仪式中被召唤出来的。不久之后，它被封印在焦林下面，但其存在继续影响着这个地区。数个世纪的沉寂已经削弱了这个存在，因为它的本质已经渗入周围的土地。自从被释放以来，它开始通过吞噬植物、树木和其他生物来积累能量。一旦获得足够的能量完全打破将其与焦林捆绑在一起的神秘枷锁，它将成为一股无法阻挡的力量，很可能给整个谦卑森林带来火焰的毁灭。",
	"The strange occurrences of late have many prominent scholars baffled: unusually aggressive emberbats, the appearance of ashsnakes, the increased frequency of forest fires, and many other phenomena which have never been seen before in Humblewood. More than mere legend, the aspect is the reason for all of these. As a creature of primordial fire, it is inextricably bound to the plane of its element. Even as it slumbered beneath the Grove for generations, the aspect has stirred, its presence causing a weakening in the barrier which keeps the material plane separate from the plane of fire, allowing for weaker creatures to slip through.": "最近发生的奇怪事件让许多知名学者感到困惑：异常攻击性的火焰蝙蝠，灰蛇的出现，森林火灾频发等许多以前在谦卑森林从未见过的现象。这一切的原因都不仅仅是传说，而是源自（the aspect）。作为原始火焰的生物，它与其元素位面紧密相连。尽管在树丛下沉睡了几代人，但这个（aspect）已经开始醒来，它的存在导致了保持物质位面与火焰位面分隔的屏障变弱，使得更弱的生物得以穿越。",
	"The aspect's essence has also seeped into the Scorched Grove, causing the landscape to take on far stronger elemental properties than before. The fundamental shift in the Grove's nature has effectively thwarted the efforts of the Tenders, who have for so long sought to heal this burned land. As the aspect continues to grow in power, more of this harmful elemental energy will be released, and even more powerful creatures will arise from the flames. If this otherworldly power spreads across the forest unchecked, all of Humblewood might suffer the fate of the Scorched Grove.": "本质的本质也渗入了（Scorched Grove），导致景观具有比以前更强烈的元素特性。（Grove）本质的根本转变有效地挫败了（Tenders）的努力，他们长期以来一直试图治愈这片烧焦的土地。随着本质继续增长，将释放更多有害的元素能量，并且更强大的生物将从火焰中出现。如果这种异世界力量在森林中不受控制地蔓延，整个（Humblewood）可能会遭受（Scorched Grove）的命运。",
	"Benna is a tall, scarred grove cervan, who wears a red bandana over her lost left eye. The leader of the Bandit Coalition, she is an idealist who believes that Alderheart's canopy, the symbol of birdfolk power in the region, should be burned and its resources looted to help those displaced by the flames. Benna lived a tranquil village life until her mother, a respected village elder and seer, foretold that the flames would come. Word was sent to Alderheart's Council, asking for supplies and aid, both of which were denied because the Council didn't believe in the power of the seer's visions. When the flames had all but consumed the village, birdfolk support arrived, but it was too late. Benna lost her family. She also lost her left eye and left ear due to the burns she sustained while helping others escape from the blaze. She fell in with the bandits and quickly rose through their ranks, thanks to her passion and purpose. She is a seasoned veteran who has been building the bandit forces, and utilizing the organization to care for humblefolk left homeless by the spreading fires.

	"It may be odd to see birdfolk working the docks and ships of Saltar's Port, but the sea is a way of life for some folk. Jobs in the seafaring industry are as lucrative as they are tough. For the birdfolk that choose to ply their trade on the water, life is about order and efficiency. One improperly stowed barrel or poorly lashed line can spell disaster on the sea. Dockmasters take their marine jobs very seriously.": "在盐港(Saltar's Port)看到鸟人在码头和船只上工作可能有些奇怪，但对一些人来说，海洋是一种生活方式。航海业的工作既有利可图，又艰苦。对于选择在水上从事贸易的鸟人来说，生活是关于秩序和效率的。一个未正确堆放的桶或牢固系缚的绳索可能在海上带来灾难。码头管理员非常认真地对待他们的海洋工作。",

	"Aspiring recruits from all over the Wood flock to the Perch Guard headquarters in the capital of Alderheart to join their ranks. After successful training, these newly sworn guards return to their home perch. They serve with pride, acting as the perch's first line of defense.

	"In smaller perches, where a guard force may be minimal or nonexistent, town security consists of a locally-organized militia. Anyone can enlist in these groups, provided they are upstanding citizens. They can be called upon by the Perch Guard to perform duties ranging from policing streets to supplementing military efforts.": "在规模较小的栖息地中，可能只有很少甚至没有警卫力量，城镇安全由当地组织的民兵组成。任何正直的市民都可以加入这些团体。他们可以被栖息地警卫召唤，执行从巡逻街道到增援军事行动等各种任务。",
	"For birdfolk who take up the seafaring trade, their home is as much on the ocean as it is at port. They relish the salt spray and stiff winds, finding the closed spaces of forest life to be stifling compared to the wide-open expanse of the sea.": "对于那些从事航海贸易的鸟人，他们的家园既在海洋上，也在港口。他们喜欢海水的飞溅和强劲的风，觉得森林生活中封闭的空间相比海洋的广阔开阔令人窒息。",
	"Birdfolk ship design often causes confusion among other seafaring races due to the relative absence of rigging. While cordage is needed to keep sails in place and cargo stored, nets and climbing ropes prove less necessary when the crew is capable of limited flight. A birdfolk sailor can simply lash a rope to their leg, open their wings, and let the ocean breeze carry them up to the sails or to a lookout post on the main mast.": "鸟人船只设计常常让其他航海种族感到困惑，因为相对缺乏索具。尽管需要绳索来固定帆和存放货物，但当船员能够进行有限飞行时，渔网和攀爬绳索就不那么必要了。鸟人水手只需将绳索系在腿上，展开翅膀，让海风将他们带到帆上或主桅杆上的瞭望台。",
	"Deceased birdfolk granted a semblance of life through necromantic spells don't have memory per se, but their skeletal bodies retain familiarity with tasks they performed in life. They also remain skilled with weapons they wielded in life, making them useful guards or servants.": "透过死灵法术赋予了一种生命的模拟，已故的鸟人并没有记忆，但他们的骨架保留了对生前执行过的任务的熟悉感。他们也保留了生前使用的武器的熟练技能，使他们成为有用的卫士或仆人。",
	"Animated skeletons are common among the practitioners of the necromantic arts. Even at the Avium, where necromancy is forbidden in practice, it is taught in theory. A common exception is the use of animated skeletons for menial tasks around the college. The reanimation of birdfolk who did not give their express consent in life is seen as a violation of their memory, so these skeletons usually consist of former college staff who desired to stay and help long past their own time. Not all scholars agree that even this relatively benign form of necromancy should be allowed, while others don't see why permission from the dead should be necessary, believing that \"dead is dead\". Though the consent policy remains in place, heady debates over the ethics of certain forms of necromancy have resulted in the shunning of more morally flexible scholars.": "动画骷髅在通常是在死灵法师中很常见。即使在阿维姆（Avium）这样一个实践中禁止死灵法术的地方，理论上也会教授这门技艺。一个常见的例外是在学院周围利用动画骷髅来做一些琐碎的任务。那些在生前没有明确同意的鸟人的复活被视为对他们记忆的侵犯，因此这些骷髅通常由一些希望长久留在学院帮助的前学院工作人员组成。并非所有学者都同意即使是这种相对温和的死灵法术形式应该被允许，而另一些人则认为并不需要死者的许可，认为“死就是死”。尽管同意政策仍然存在，对于某些形式的死灵法术伦理问题的激烈辩论导致了对更加灵活的学者的避之不及。",
	"The bulk of the Perch Guard's military force are a light infantry called \"The Spears.\" They train relentlessly with polearm weapons perfectly suited for branch-to-branch combat.

	"Slimes are easily provoked, and while it isn't difficult to outrun one, some who have strayed into a slime's territory only find out too late that they have been detected. Fortunately for many swampland travelers, slimes have a slow metabolism, and can go without feeding for long periods.": "史莱姆容易被激怒，虽然要甩开它们并不困难，但一些误入史莱姆领地的人往往太迟才发现自己已经被发现。幸运的是，对许多沼泽旅行者来说，史莱姆新陈代谢缓慢，可以长时间不进食。",
	"In addition to being an important part of the ecosystem, many slimes are either naturally magical, or yield organic materials which are in high demand among mages, scholars, and researchers. While slime hunting is a dangerous undertaking, the perch of Winnowing Reach was built on the labor of so-called \"slime-wranglers\", whose skill collecting valuable residue from live slimes is directly responsible for transforming the once minor outpost into a thriving site for scholarly innovation.": "除了作为生态系统中重要的一部分外，许多史莱姆要么天生具有魔法属性，要么产出有机材料，这些材料在法师、学者和研究人员中需求量很大。虽然捕捉史莱姆是一项危险的任务，但是在温诺温尼地区，这座高处建筑物是由所谓的“史莱姆驯兽师”建造的，他们擅长从活史莱姆身上收集有价值的残留物，这直接促成了这个曾经不起眼的前哨站变成了一个繁荣的学术创新场所。",
	"Three main types of slimes have been classified, but as magical creatures with strange properties, it's speculated that more elusive slime species might exist somewhere in the remote swamps.

	"These pale green oozes have an astringent chemical odor, which mixes with the smell of liquefied flesh from their latest meal. Owing to the slow speed at which they digest their victims, the bones of partially-digested meals can be seen through their transparent exterior. Dissolving remnants move within the slimes in a macabre semblance of motion. This phenomena has earned them the nickname \"green puppeteers\".": "这些苍白绿色的软泥怪散发着一种收敛的化学气味，与它们最新一餐的液化肉体的气味混合在一起。由于它们消化受害者的速度很慢，部分消化的食物的骨头可以透过它们透明的外表看到。溶解的残余物在软泥中移动，仿佛是一种可怕的运动。这种现象使它们赢得了“绿色操纵者”这个绰号。",
	"Capable of producing a lethal acid that can eat away at stone and metal, caustic slimes are especially deadly. Even the slightest touch on exposed fur or feathers can be dangerous. Many would-be heroes have met a slow, grim demise after being engulfed by these strange creatures.": "能够产生可以腐蚀石头和金属的致命酸液，腐蚀粘液尤其致命。即使是轻微接触裸露的毛发或羽毛也可能危险。许多意图成为英雄的人在被这些奇怪的生物吞没后都遭遇了缓慢而可怕的死亡。",

	"Bandit clans are commanded by generals. Serving as both a battle-tested warrior and master strategist, they alone coordinate the disparate band of thieves and outlaws that make up the collective. While military monikers are used to refer to bandit leadership, more than combat prowess is needed to maintain order in these volatile organizations. A dominating personality and charismatic voice are as necessary as a swift blade and a sharp mind. Cervans don't typically take to brigandry, but their practical skills and ability to survive in even the most adverse situations make those with loose morals and dubious ambitions a natural fit.": "强盗团由将军指挥。作为经过战斗考验的战士和高明的策略家，他们独自协调着组成集体的各种强盗和歹徒。虽然军事称谓被用来指代强盗领导，但在这些不稳定组织中，维持秩序需要的不仅仅是战斗能力。统治性格和有感召力的声音与敏捷的刀剑和敏锐的头脑一样重要。瑟凡人通常不会从事强盗行为，但他们的实用技能和在最恶劣环境中生存的能力使那些道德观念不严谨、野心勃勃的人自然而然地适合这个角色。",
	"Cervan villages are typically led by a community elder who is wise both in politics as well as the ways of the Amaranthine.

	"Cobblefrights are undead monstrosities created through dark necromancy. Rumored to have been orig-inally devised by the mad necromancer Lathrus of the Night's Call, cobblefrights are made by linking several birdfolk skeletons together to form one frightening creature with enhanced physical properties. Among those who have studied Lathrus' research, only the most reckless have tried to create a cobblefright of their own, often to disastrous effect.": "石狂鬼是通过黑暗死灵魔法创造出来的不死怪物。传言说这种怪物最初是由疯狂的死灵术士夜呼者拉斯鲁斯创造的，石狂鬼是通过将几个鸟人骷髅连接在一起形成一个可怕的生物，具有增强的物理特性。在研究拉斯鲁斯的研究成果的人中，只有最鲁莽的人尝试过创建自己的石狂鬼，往往导致灾难性后果。",
	"Cobblefrights are generally pieced together from the skeletons of five or six birdfolk. The combination of multiple bodies allows not only for a larger and more robust design, but also vastly increases the quantity of necromantic energies cobblefrights contain. This increased capacity for power provides cobblefrights with tremendous strength, as much as a dozen birdfolk combined. It also grants cobblefright bones greater durability. Their remarkable power and resilience is somewhat of a double-edged sword, as cobblefrights also require a large amount of necromantic energy to be sustained. The surviving records of cobblefright creators note that, quite unexpectedly, the creatures developed the ability to drain the life force of other living beings, replenishing their own energy in the process. This makes cobblefrights useful as independent sentries, so long as they have a steady supply of living beings to fuel them.": "石街鬼(Cobblefrights)通常由五到六只鸟人的骨骼拼凑而成。多个身体的结合不仅使得设计更大更坚固，还大大增加了石街鬼所含的死灵能量的数量。这种增加的能量容量赋予了石街鬼巨大的力量，相当于十几只鸟人的力量总和。它还赋予了石街鬼骨骼更强的耐久性。它们非凡的力量和韧性有点双刃剑，因为石街鬼也需要大量的死灵能量来维持。有关石街鬼创造者的幸存记录指出，令人意外的是，这些生物发展出了吸取其他生物生命力的能力，从而在过程中补充自己的能量。这使得石街鬼作为独立哨兵非常有用，只要它们有稳定的生物供应来提供能量。",
	"The discordant parts that comprise cobblefrights exert tremendous strain on the bodies of these creatures. The source of this strain is rooted in the same magic that allows birdfolk skeletons to recall skills they once knew in life: the bones remember. Remnants of the soul such as memories, desires, fears, skills, and certain forms of knowledge are imprinted on the bones of the departed. When activated by necromantic energy, these conflicting impressions swirl chaotically within cobblefrights. Since cobblefrights are composed of multiple bodies, often originating from differing times, places, and walks of life, the impressions contained within the creatures are particularly volatile and chaotic. This constant internal conflict requires large and regular supplies of energy to keep cobblefrights stable, but it also grants them a surprising degree of resistance against those who would seek to wrest control of the creatures away from their creator. However, necromancers must be careful to maintain control over these dangerous creatures. Damaged cobblefrights will readily harvest their maker as an immediate source of life energy.": "组成石鬼的不协调部分对这些生物的身体施加了巨大的压力。这种压力的根源在于与鸟人骷髅能够回忆起它们生前所知技能的魔法相同：骨骼记得。灵魂的残留物，如记忆、欲望、恐惧、技能和某些形式的知识，都印刻在逝者的骨骼上。当被死灵能量激活时，这些冲突的印象在石鬼内部混乱涡旋。由于石鬼由多个身体组成，通常来自不同的时代、地点和生活方式，所以这些生物内含的印象特别不稳定和混乱。这种持续的内部冲突需要大量且定期的能量供应来保持石鬼的稳定，但也赋予它们出乎意料的抵抗力，使那些试图夺取这些生物控制权的人望而却步。然而，死灵术士必须小心控制这些危险的生物。受损的石鬼会毫不犹豫地将它们的创造者作为即时的生命能量来源。",

	"Every sentient being is susceptible to the lure of necromancy. The promise of seeing lost loved ones again, or raising an army of powerful minions, can sometimes be difficult to resist. The birdfolk of Humblewood are not immune to that lure. To help curb this curiosity, professors at The Avium teach necromantic theory only. But some intrepid students have been known to pursue the practical applications in secret. Sure of their intellect, corvums in particular are often willing to challenge traditions for the sake of knowledge.

	"Emberbats only started appearing in Humblewood after the calamity that befell the Scorched Grove, and scholars nearly all agree that the emergence of the creatures had something to do with the elemental magics present in the Grove. The flames that give the bats their name are lit through an internal combustion process that issues fuel from their nostrils as they exhale. Emberbats appear able to start and stop this process at will. The bats obviously do not need the flames to see, but it is hypothesized that the small candle serves to attract moths or other insects into their waiting mouths, greatly facilitating hunting.": "在灾难降临灼热林之后，燃火蝙蝠才开始出现在谦卑森林中。几乎所有学者都认为这些生物的出现与林中的元素魔法有关。这些蝙蝠之所以被称为“燃火蝙蝠”，是因为它们体内的燃烧过程通过鼻孔排出燃料，随着呼气而点燃。燃火蝙蝠似乎能够随意启动和停止这个过程。显然，这些蝙蝠并不需要火焰来看清事物，但有假设认为这小小的蜡烛能吸引飞蛾或其他昆虫飞入它们张开的嘴中，极大地促进了狩猎。",
	"Emberbats are most often seen flying in clouds consisting of many different families acting in unison. The bats perform virtually every task as a cohesive unit, from flying to hunting to nesting. The real threat they pose lies in the remarkable coordination of their colonies.": "燃火蝙蝠经常在由许多不同家族组成的群体中飞行。这些蝙蝠几乎每项任务都是作为一个团结的单位进行的，从飞行到狩猎再到筑巢。它们的真正威胁在于它们群体的卓越协调能力。",
	"Alone, an emberbat is no more dangerous than a candle. But together they have the potential to burn like a pit of hot embers, and can easily set dry tinder ablaze. When a colony of emberbats attacks a target, it is usually for defensive purposes. The air temperature within the cloud rises dangerously fast, and it has to potential to cook the victim alive. When encountering a colony in the wild, it is best not to engage them. However, recently colonies of emberbats are acting aggressively towards travelers, harassing any who approach their expanding territories. Some swear they have seen emberbat supercolonies whose heat could be felt from yards away.": "独自一只，火焰蝙蝠比蜡烛更危险。但是当它们聚集在一起时，它们有像炽热余烬坑一样燃烧的潜力，很容易点燃干燥的火绒。当一群火焰蝙蝠攻击目标时，通常是出于防御目的。云团内的空气温度危险地迅速上升，有可能将受害者活活烤熟。在野外遇到一群火焰蝙蝠时，最好不要与它们交战。然而，最近一些火焰蝙蝠群体对旅行者表现出攻击性，骚扰任何接近它们不断扩张领地的人。有人宣称他们曾看到火焰蝙蝠超级群体，其热量能够在数码之外感受到。",

They are adept at moving unseen through the canopy where they hunt, and their skills as ambush predators means that few who see them live to tell the tale.

The large fangs seen adorning the necks of Humblewood's greatest hunters and warriors, and cloaks made from prowler fur, are trophies that showcase one's prowess and skill.": "森林潜行者之所以获得神话般的地位，其中一个原因是它们难以捉摸的本性。它们擅长在树冠中悄无声息地移动，狩猎，作为伏击猎食者的技能意味着很少有人看到它们能活着讲述故事。在一些社区中，杀死一只森林潜行者被视为野兽猎人中的成人礼。在Humblewood（（D&D游戏设定））最伟大的猎人和战士的颈部上装饰着的大尖牙，以及由潜行者皮毛制成的斗篷，是展示一个人技艺和技能的战利品。",
	"Forest prowlers are apex predators. They can claim virtually any prey they desire, but usually target deer, elk, and other large herbivores.

	"Whether drawn by tales of treasure or the allure of faraway lands, some residents of Humblewood journey to seek out distant ruins or remote vistas to satisfy their wanderlust. Explorers are common among raptors, many of whom do so out of veneration for the Amaranthine Reya, the guide and protector of travelers.
