	"With his skin aglow like searing coal, a beard like sheafs of burnt paper, and hair billowing like smoke, Exul's physical form does nothing to hide his elemental nature. He was born as a spirit of earth and flame. This physical manifestation is a dalliance of mere decades, he hopes.": "他的皮肤像灼热的煤炭一样发光，胡子像烧过的纸片，头发像烟一样飘扬，埃克苏尔的身体形态丝毫不能掩盖他的元素本性。他生来就是土和火焰的精灵。他希望，这种身体上的表现只是几十年的沉睡而已。",
	"Exul serves Tyreus not out of loyalty, but due to a geas. Exul bears Tyreus only a little ill will, however, as occasional \"arrangements\" with mortal wizards are no great hassle. Exul resents and avoids the pain of the geas, ideally, but has no intention of dying for Tyreus's petty, mortal ambitions.": "埃克苏尔为泰勒斯服务并不是出于忠诚，而是由于一种格言。然而，埃克苏尔只对提瑞斯有一点恶意，因为偶尔与凡人巫师的 \"安排 \"并不是什么大麻烦。理想情况下，埃克苏尔憎恨并避免格言的痛苦，但他无意为泰勒斯的卑微、凡人的野心而死。",
	"Malivar Kresk is a Red Wizard of Thay, a conjurer, and recent apprentice to the treacherous Red Wizard named Morwena. Young, pale white, plain, and slender, Malivar usually hates his own appearance but hopes his red robes and smooth scalp give him a \"lean and mean\" look.": "马利瓦-克瑞斯克是泰伊的一名红袍巫师，是一名魔法师，也是名为莫维纳的奸诈红袍巫师的最近学徒。年轻、苍白、朴素、修长，马利瓦通常讨厌自己的外表，但希望他的红袍和光滑的头皮能给他一个 \"精瘦 \"的形象。",
	"Now alone on his mission, Malivar doesn't hesitate to use or abuse the trust of others if it means he can get revenge, return to Thay alive, and report on Morwena's betrayal.": "现在他独自执行任务，马利瓦毫不犹豫地利用或滥用他人的信任，只要这意味着他能报仇，活着回到泰伊，并报告莫维纳的背叛行为。"
