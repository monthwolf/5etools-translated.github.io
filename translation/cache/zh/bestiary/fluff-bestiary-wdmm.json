She can speak using one or both of her mouths.": "一年多前，贝兰和她的哥哥科瓦短暂地进入了远界，在那里他们融合成了一个单一的身体形态。这种融合抹去了科瓦的大部分身体和个性，给贝兰留下了曾经属于她哥哥的一张嘴和一双手臂。她还继承了他的一些内部器官和个性特征。她可以用她的一张嘴或两张嘴说话。",

	"This creature used to be two separate duergar, a male named Blork and a female named Muatha. Arcturia fused them together into a single creature by using magic that only a {@spell wish} spell can undo. Both skulls merged into one bulbous head that has three ears, three eyes, two noses, and two mouths.

	"Halaster's abilities far exceed those of most mortal wizards. His expertise with magic gates allows him to travel far and wide to engage in magical research. He spends much of his time creating gates, moving them around, and casting elder runes on them. Halaster's gates connect the different levels of Undermountain, thus enabling him to bring new monsters into the dungeon to replenish those that die or escape.

	"Halaster's true form is that of a tall, gaunt, male human, but he uses magic to take on many other visages and shapes. No matter what form he wears, the Mad Mage giggles and mutters incessantly.

Muiral learned enough magic to transform himself into a half-scorpion monstrosity, becoming known as Muiral the Misshapen. He then retired to the level of Undermountain that would later be called Muiral's Gauntlet, driving out and slaying its original drow denizens. Muiral now spends his days hunting adventurers and other interlopers for fun. Long years alone—and Halaster's influence—have rendered him utterly insane.": "穆伊拉是一名出色的人类战士，长期担任哈拉斯特的保镖。当他要求疯狂法师指导他学习巫术时，他开始陷入疯狂的境地。穆伊拉学会了足够的魔法，将自己变成了一个半蝎子的怪物，成为众所周知的穆伊拉-错乱者。然后他退隐到后来被称为穆伊拉之铠的地下山一层，赶走并杀死了那里原来的乌鸦居民。穆伊拉现在每天都在猎杀冒险者和其他闯入者来取乐。长年的孤独和哈拉斯特的影响使他完全陷入了疯狂。",

Unwilling to face his own mortal end, Underbrew made this vow and convinced himself over time that the executions he performed were acts of mercy, because those he killed would never be forced to turn against their beliefs as he had. In time, these acts stopped weighing on Underbrew's conscience.
