	"Archaics are towering, multi-armed creatures overflowing with magic. Despite their solitude, archaics carry vast understanding of magic and the world's history, as well as the ability to warp the fabric of the world around them. Sages who seek out archaics for their knowledge receive confusing and often contradictory answers to questions. If a supplicant successfully unwinds the tangle, the answer they seek is revealed.": "古代人是高大的、多臂的生物，充满了魔力。尽管他们很孤独，但古人对魔法和世界的历史有着广泛的了解，并且有能力扭曲他们周围世界的结构。向古人寻求知识的圣人会得到混乱的、经常是矛盾的问题答案。如果祈求者成功解开纠结，他们所寻求的答案就会显现出来。",
	"In truth, archaics are the reincarnated souls of the oracles of Strixhaven. When an oracle dies, their soul travels back through time to the explosion of magic that brought the Founder Dragons into being. In that outrush of creative force, the oracle's soul can be caught in the tide and clad in the very substance of the world, becoming an archaic. Because their knowledge cuts across the flow of time, archaics are careful how much they reveal to mortals and thus tend to speak in riddles.": "事实上，古人是斯特里沙文的神谕者的转世灵魂。当一个神谕者死亡时，他们的灵魂会穿越时空回到将创始者之龙带入的魔法爆炸中。在那股创造性力量的涌动中，神谕者的灵魂可能被卷入潮水中，并被世界的实质所包裹，成为一个古人。由于他们的知识跨越了时间的流逝，古人对他们向凡人透露的内容很谨慎，因此倾向于用谜语说话。",
	"Often referred to as a \"living expression,\" an art elemental is an aspect of creativity and emotion given physical form—making it the perfect mascot for Prismari College.": "艺术元素通常被称为 \"活的表达\"，它是创造力和情感的一个方面，被赋予了物理形式，这使得它成为棱镜学院的完美吉祥物。",
	"To create an art elemental mascot, a mage draws power from a blend of all the natural elements, extracting their vibrant colors to craft a swirling outer shell before imbuing its core with a planar spirit. As creatures of both precise elemental study and rebellious expression, art elementals can both wreak elemental destruction and emotionally captivate the creatures around them.": "为了创造一个艺术元素吉祥物，法师从所有自然元素的混合中汲取力量，提取它们鲜艳的颜色来制作一个旋转的外壳，然后再将其核心注入一个平面精神。作为同时具有精确的元素研究和叛逆表达的生物，艺术元素既能造成元素破坏，又能在情感上吸引周围的生物。",
	"The dragon Beledros masters the intertwined magic of life and death. Her power taps into the life force flowing through living things and the natural world. She manipulates that energy to give healing and life or to bring death and decay. Her mastery of this magic sustains her own life force even without the sustenance of food, drink, or even air.": "龙Beledros掌握着生与死交织的魔法。她的力量可以挖掘出流经生物和自然界的生命力。她操纵这种能量来给予治疗和生命，或者带来死亡和腐烂。她对这种魔法的掌握使她自己的生命力得以维持，即使没有食物、饮料、甚至空气的滋养。",
	"She founded Witherbloom College to pass on her understanding of the natural cycle. She hoped to create generations of stewards who would use her teachings to defend nature and help others. In keeping with the dichotomous nature of her philosophy and magic, she views the more dangerous aspects of nature, including the inevitability of death and decay, as natural and integral parts of existence.": "她创建了Witherbloom学院，以传授她对自然循环的理解。她希望能培养出一代又一代的管理人，用她的教诲来捍卫自然，帮助他人。与她的哲学和魔法的二分法性质相一致，她认为自然界更危险的方面，包括死亡和腐烂的不可避免性，是存在的自然和不可或缺的部分。",
	"Brackish trudges are lumbering masses of sentient fungus and vegetation that thrive in the bayou. They are living examples of the conflicting forces of life and decay existing in a harmonious cycle. Flowers and other plant life grow on their backs, necks, and heads. When these plants die, they decay and become the ideal habitat for fungi. The older a trudge is, the wilder and more varied are the plants and fungi that thrive in the tiny ecosystem on its back.": "咸水垃圾是由有生命的真菌和植被组成的笨重的群体，在河口地区茁壮成长。它们是生命和腐烂的冲突力量存在于和谐循环中的活生生的例子。花和其他植物生长在它们的背上、脖子上和头上。当这些植物死亡时，它们会腐烂，成为真菌的理想栖息地。跋涉者越老，在其背上的小生态系统中茁壮成长的植物和真菌就越狂野、越多样。",
	"While sometimes ill-tempered and territorial, brackish trudges are usually content to mind their own business. When trudges are roused to defend themselves or drive off rivals, their punishing tusks laced with deadly fungus spores can make short work of the unwary. Trudges are also notoriously difficult to slay; the energies of life and death within them allow them to survive harrowing injuries.": "虽然有时脾气不好，而且有地域性，但咸水牛通常满足于管好自己的事。当河豚被唤醒以保护自己或赶走对手时，它们那带着致命真菌孢子的惩罚性獠牙会让不警惕的人很快就被杀死。鳟鱼也是出了名的难杀之物；它们体内的生与死的能量使它们能够在痛苦的伤害中幸存下来。",
	"Programmed with knowledge of Strixhaven's extensive lore catalog, cogwork archivists serve as keepers of the university's various libraries. The archivists' towering metal frames are equipped with long, articulated limbs and retractable conservator tools, which they use to organize and preserve documents from throughout Strixhaven's winding history. Many cogwork archivists can be found among the towering shelves of the Biblioplex, simultaneously retrieving scrolls for curious students while keeping a stern eye on any rowdy groups that might disrupt the quiet atmosphere.": "通过对Strixhaven广泛的传说目录进行编程，齿轮工程档案员充当了该大学各种图书馆的保管员。档案员高大的金属框架配备了长长的铰接式肢体和可伸缩的保存工具，他们用这些工具来整理和保存来自整个Strixhaven蜿蜒历史的文件。在图书馆高耸的书架间可以看到许多齿轮工程档案员，他们同时为好奇的学生们取回卷轴，同时对任何可能扰乱安静气氛的喧闹团体保持严厉的关注。",
	"Slipping through the darkest corners of the world, daemogoths are powerful fiendish creatures that feed on misery and other negative emotions. Some sages refer to daemogoths as tear lickers, owing to the fiends' tendency to lurk near battlefields and other sites of great tragedy to consume the anguish saturating the area.": "daemogoths在世界最黑暗的角落里溜达，是强大的恶魔生物，以苦难和其他负面情绪为食。一些圣人把daemogoths称为舔泪者，因为这种恶魔倾向于潜伏在战场和其他重大悲剧现场附近，以消耗该地区饱和的痛苦情绪。",
	"Daemogoths are creatures of forbidden knowledge and magic, all fueled by their consumption of anguish. They trade magical influence over the lives and minds of others to ambitious mortals in exchange for the mortal's agony.": "Daemogoths是禁忌知识和魔法的生物，所有的燃料都来自于他们对痛苦的消耗。他们用对他人生命和思想的魔法影响来交换野心勃勃的凡人，以换取凡人的痛苦。",
	"Daemogoths are alien-looking in the extreme. Their eyes are insectile or smooth and bulbous like gleaming jewels, and they have five arms. They typically wear long robes, which drape low over their forms, and they sport a halo of horns, antlers, or floating stones or crystals.": "戴莫戈斯是极端的外星人。他们的眼睛是昆虫状的，或者像闪闪发光的珠宝一样光滑圆润，他们有五只手臂。他们通常穿着长袍，长袍低垂在他们的身体上，他们身上有角、鹿角或漂浮的石头或水晶的光环。",
	"Daemogoth titans are towering monsters that blight the land around them. A daemogoth grows in power over the course of decades spent feeding on sorrow and draining life from nature. Eventually that growth turns the daemogoth into a titan.": "Daemogoth titans是高大的怪物，使他们周围的土地受到损害。daemogoth的力量在几十年的时间里不断增长，以悲伤为食，耗尽自然界的生命。最终，这种增长将大魔王变成了泰坦。",
	"The titans maintain their lesser cousins' ability to trade magical power for a mortal's pain, but they tend to demand more punishing suffering in exchange for their pacts or knowledge.": "泰坦保持了他们较小的表亲用魔力换取凡人的痛苦的能力，但他们往往要求更多的惩罚性痛苦来换取他们的契约或知识。",
	"When a supplicant piques a daemogoth titan's interest, the titan can grant a blessing to the supplicant (see \"Supernatural Gifts \"in the Dungeon Master's Guide). As long as the creature has the blessing, it must expend and roll two of its Hit Dice whenever it finishes a long rest. It takes psychic damage equal to the total rolled, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the psychic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes its next long rest. The creature dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The blessing can be removed only by a {@spell wish} spell.": "当一个祈求者引起戴莫苟斯泰坦的兴趣时，泰坦可以给祈求者一个祝福（见《地下城主指南》中的 \"超自然的礼物\"）。只要该生物拥有这个祝福，它就必须在完成长时间休息时消耗并掷出两个命中率骰子。它受到的精神伤害与掷出的总数相等，而且它的最大命中率会减少，减少的数量与受到的精神伤害相等。这种减少持续到该生物完成其下一次长时休息。如果这个效果将它的最大命中率降低到0，该生物就会死亡。这个祝福只能由一个{@spell wish}的法术去除。",
	"A student who has not yet chosen one of Strixhaven's five mystic colleges is referred to as a first-year student, after the one year of basic curriculum that most students must complete before selecting their school. These beginner students are taught by faculty from all of Strixhaven's colleges, learning rudimentary magic as they acclimate to the university's environment. Once a student has selected a college, they trade their plain gray first-year uniforms for the trappings of their chosen school and begin honing—or even replacing—the magic they learned in their initial year with other skills.": "还没有选择Strixhaven的五所神秘学院之一的学生被称为一年级学生，在大多数学生选择学校之前必须完成一年的基础课程。这些初级学生由来自Strixhaven所有学院的教师教授，在适应大学环境的同时学习基本的魔法。一旦学生选择了一所大学，他们就会用朴素的灰色一年级制服换取他们所选择的学校的装饰品，并开始磨练--甚至用其他技能取代他们在最初一年学到的魔法。",
	"To an untrained eye, a fractal mascot looks like a creature made from facets of hard light. But arithmancers know that these fractals are actually living equations: artificial life forms created by extrapolating magic from the mathematical patterns in nature.": "在未经训练的人眼里，分形吉祥物看起来就像一个由硬光的切面组成的生物。但算术师们知道，这些分形实际上是活的方程式：通过从自然界的数学模式中推导出的魔力创造出的人工生命形式。",
	"Because of their arithmetic basis, fractal mascots can alter both their size and density. Quandrix College has adopted the fractal as its mascot, and many a Quandrix student can be found playing fetch with a fractal companion in between lessons.": "由于其算术基础，分形的吉祥物可以改变其大小和密度。Quandrix学院采用分形作为其吉祥物，许多Quandrix的学生可以在课间发现与分形伙伴玩取物游戏。",
	"The dragon Galazeth Prismari embodies the flow of magic from inspiration into artistic expression, whether through physical form or another sensory medium. His magic draws on primal energy—such as flame, lightning, and the tides—and weaves them into spectacles both beautiful and deadly.": "龙Galazeth Prismari体现了从灵感到艺术表达的魔法流，无论是通过物理形式还是其他感官媒介。他的魔法汲取了原始的能量，如火焰、闪电和潮汐，并将它们编织成既美丽又致命的景象。",
	"Galazeth founded Prismari College to ensure that the study of magic wouldn't ever be relegated to pure practicality. His teachings emphasize that magic's beauty must contribute to unfolding culture and personal emotional growth. Galazeth views dynamic expression and precise perfection as necessarily competing forces, both within individuals and the world at large.": "加拉泽斯创建了棱镜学院，以确保魔法的研究永远不会沦为纯粹的实用主义。他的教义强调，魔法之美必须有助于文化的发展和个人情感的成长。加拉泽斯认为动态的表达和精确的完美必然是相互竞争的力量，无论是在个人还是在整个世界。",
	"Many a Strixhaven student wandering the bayou has stepped on a seemingly mundane patch of moss—only to discover that it was the back of a hungry groff lurking beneath the surface. These shaggy swamp creatures have canine faces and glowing blue eyes, and they are ravenous carnivores—with pest mascots being their favorite food. A handful of more intrepid Witherbloom mages have learned to follow groffs in order to track down pest mascots, but most of these mages have yet to find a way to capture the pests before the groff eats someone.": "许多在河口徘徊的斯特里克斯海文的学生都踩到了一片看似平凡的苔藓，却发现那是潜伏在地表下的饥饿的格罗夫的背。这些蓬头垢面的沼泽生物长着犬牙交错的脸和发亮的蓝眼睛，它们是贪婪的食肉动物--害虫吉祥物是它们最喜欢的食物。少数更无畏的Witherbloom法师已经学会了跟踪格罗夫，以追踪害虫吉祥物，但这些法师大多还没有找到在格罗夫吃人之前捕捉害虫的方法。",
	"Squelching slightly as they wriggle through the air, inklings serve as the mascots for Silverquill College. These living blobs of shadowy ink are often summoned by professors who require assistance in their writing workshops—the inklings provide endless ink—or by lonely students hoping for company as they study. However, inklings can just as readily support mages in combat, disrupting opponents' sight.": "当它们在空气中蠕动时，inklings微微发抖，是Silverquill学院的吉祥物。这些活生生的阴暗墨水块经常被那些在写作研讨会上需要帮助的教授们召唤出来--伊克灵提供了无尽的墨水，或者被那些希望在学习中得到陪伴的孤独学生召唤出来。然而，inklings在战斗中也可以随时支持法师，扰乱对手的视线。",
	"Deep in crumbling ruins and piles of dusty scrolls, Lorehold students—first as apprentices and then as pledgemages—study the magic of the past, searching for arcane artifacts and speaking with long-dead adventurers to uncover secrets lost to time.": "在摇摇欲坠的废墟和堆积如山的卷轴深处，罗尔霍德的学生--先是作为学徒，然后是作为宣誓法师--研究过去的魔法，寻找神秘的文物，与早已死去的冒险者交谈，以揭开消失在时间中的秘密。",
	"Though many Lorehold students bury themselves in old tomes, others take a more cavalier approach to their studies and travel the world to see history made before their eyes. Their magic can range from spells tampering with the flow of time itself to concussive blasts that break through old ruins—to sometimes just bashing things with a glowing scroll.": "尽管许多罗尔霍德的学生把自己埋在古老的书本里，但其他学生对他们的研究采取了一种更轻率的方式，并在世界范围内看到历史在他们眼前发生。他们的魔法范围很广，从篡改时间流本身的法术，到突破古老废墟的震荡性爆炸，有时只是用发光的卷轴敲打东西。",
	"The archaeomancers of Lorehold College draw their magical might from the flow of time and fate and the way those forces shape the course of history. Scholars of this broad mystical study divide between those who see history as an unpredictable jumble of chance and those who believe events form a perfect—and predictable—pattern.": "罗尔霍德学院的考古学家们从时间和命运的流动以及这些力量塑造历史进程的方式中汲取他们的魔法力量。研究这一广泛的神秘学的学者们分为两种，一种是将历史视为不可预测的混乱的机会，另一种是认为事件形成了一个完美的、可预测的模式。",
	"Professors of chaos wield magic inspired by the ebb and flow of chance. They study the course history has taken, looking for breaking points in the flow of events, and focus their magic into creating breaks that are to their advantage. Whether those breaks are in a series of events, in obstacles, or in enemies depends on the needs in the moment. They crush enemies' plans under the weight of time and lash out with magical energy that often takes the appearance of books, scrolls, and sheets of parchment.": "混乱教授在机会的起伏中施展魔法。他们研究历史进程，寻找事件流中的突破点，并将他们的魔法集中于创造对他们有利的突破点。这些突破点是在一系列事件中，还是在障碍物中，还是在敌人中，取决于当时的需要。他们在时间的重压下粉碎敌人的计划，并以魔法能量进行攻击，这些魔法能量通常以书籍、卷轴和羊皮纸的形式出现。",
	"Lorehold's professors of order search for evidence of patterns and predictable outcomes in history. They study the flow of events, learning which occurrences herald specific outcomes, and they trace their magic through those paths of causality. In their exploration of ruins, professors of order shore up dangerous structures and find the safest paths as they search. When confronted, they confound their foes by channeling the stasis of perfect order, creating resilient barriers of force and quashing hostile magic.": "Lorehold的秩序教授在历史中寻找模式和可预测结果的证据。他们研究事件的流向，了解哪些事件预示着特定的结果，他们通过这些因果关系的路径追踪他们的魔法。在对废墟的探索中，秩序教授会加固危险的结构，并在搜索中找到最安全的路径。当遇到这种情况时，他们会通过引导完美秩序的静止状态来迷惑他们的敌人，创造出有弹性的力量屏障，平息敌对的魔法。",
	"Mage hunters are hideous spider-legged creatures employed by the Oriq to pursue magic-wielders. These creatures can naturally sense magic via the glowing purple spines on their backs.": "法师猎手是奥里克人雇佣的狰狞的蜘蛛腿生物，用来追捕施法者。这些生物可以通过它们背上发光的紫色刺自然地感知魔法。",
	"A mage hunter is usually in its sentry form, a diamond-shaped drone with a heightened ability to sense and locate mages. Once it finds a quarry, the mage hunter takes on its arachnoid hunter form and pursues its targets with vicious skill.": "法师猎人通常以哨兵的形式出现，这是一种菱形的无人机，对法师的感知和定位能力都比较强。一旦找到猎物，法师猎手就会变成蛛网状的猎手形态，以凶狠的技巧追击目标。",

Tell the players the following to give them context about this evil spellcaster:": "在给角色们布置完任务后，兰教授交给他们一份文件，里面有教员们从大学记录中收集的关于穆尔加索的信息。告诉玩家以下内容，让他们了解这个邪恶施法者的背景。",
	"Murgaxor is a bullywug who attended Strixhaven 200 years ago. He was a member of Witherbloom College, though there are no records of him participating in any activities or working on campus.": "穆尔加索是一个200年前就读于斯特里克斯哈文的恶霸虫。他是威瑟布洛姆学院的成员，尽管没有他参加任何活动或在校园工作的记录。",
	"A mean-spirited, egotistical spellcaster, Murgaxor was censured repeatedly for disregarding safety protocols, hexing and cursing peers, and using harmful magic while on campus.": "穆尔加索是一个刻薄、自负的施法者，因无视安全协议，在校园内对同伴施以魔法和诅咒，以及使用有害的魔法而多次受到训斥。",
	"University officials believe Murgaxor began his illicit experiments with life-draining magic shortly after he enrolled as a student.": "大学官员认为，穆尔加索在注册成为学生后不久就开始了他非法的消耗生命的魔法实验。",
	"In his third year, Murgaxor was expelled for using life-draining magic when it resulted in another student's death. Murgaxor fled before he could be handed over to authorities.": "在第三年，穆尔加索因使用消耗生命的魔法导致另一名学生死亡而被开除。穆尔加索在被移交给当局之前逃跑了。",
	"For a few years after his expulsion, Murgaxor was reportedly sighted around the outskirts of campus, specifically in Sedgemoor and the Detention Bog. Authorities believed something about those locations enhanced his magic, but he was never caught. Sightings soon stopped, and no further evidence of Murgaxor's presence was found. Offcials assumed he was dead and struck Murgaxor from Strixhaven's records, as they considered him a blot on the university's reputation.": "在他被开除后的几年里，据说有人在校园外围看到穆加索，特别是在赛德摩尔和拘留所。当局认为这些地方的某些东西增强了他的魔力，但他从未被抓住。目击事件很快就停止了，也没有发现穆尔加索存在的进一步证据。官方认为他已经死了，并将穆尔加索从斯特里夏文的记录中删除，因为他们认为他是大学声誉的污点。",
	"Somewhere in the lands beyond Strixhaven's borders lives the Oracle: a wise and accomplished mage, tasked by the Founder Dragons to ensure that the magic of Strixhaven is used to help others and not twisted to evil ends. The one who holds the mantle of the Oracle must not only understand the fundamental truths of magic, but also possess impeccable wisdom and unshakable virtue.": "在斯特里沙文边界之外的某处，住着一位神谕者：一位睿智而有成就的法师，受创始人龙的委托，确保斯特里沙文的魔法被用来帮助他人，而不是被扭曲为邪恶的目的。执掌神谕者不仅要了解魔法的基本真理，还必须拥有无可挑剔的智慧和不可动摇的美德。",
	"The current Oracle is an elderly human named Jadzi. A graduate of Quandrix College, Jadzi has since expanded her studies to encompass all disciplines of spellcasting, tempering the mathematical abstractions she wielded at Strixhaven with benevolent divination and a return to the basics of magic itself.": "目前的神谕是一位名叫贾兹（Jadzi）的老年人类。作为昆德里克斯学院的毕业生，贾兹后来扩大了她的研究范围，涵盖了法术的所有学科，用仁慈的占卜和对魔法本身基本原理的回归来缓和她在斯特里沙文挥舞的数学抽象概念。",
	"Oriq blood mages create deadly weapons formed of their own blood. They can also sense the life energy within nearby creatures, making the blood mages almost impossible to ambush.": "奥利克血魔法师用自己的血液制造出致命的武器。他们还能感知附近生物的生命能量，使血魔法师几乎不可能被伏击。",
	"The Oriq are a secret society of mages who wield forbidden magic in the service of their leader, Extus Narr. Narr was in consideration for elevation to the role of Oracle of Strixhaven, but when the Founder Dragons passed him over in favor of Jadzi, his bitterness knew no bounds. He now uses the Oriq to gather the spells and magical energy he needs to summon a devastating being, the Blood Avatar, to destroy Strixhaven.": "Oriq是一个秘密的法师团体，他们挥舞着禁忌的魔法为他们的领袖Extus Narr服务。纳尔曾被考虑提升为斯特里沙文的神谕者，但当创始者龙放弃他而选择贾兹时，他的怨恨无以复加。他现在用奥里奇来收集他所需要的法术和魔法能量，以召唤一个毁灭性的存在--血神通，来摧毁斯特里沙文。",
	"The Oriq work in secret, infiltrating Strixhaven to search for the magic their master covets and watch for impressionable students and embittered faculty they might turn to their cause. The Oriq take pains to hide their true allegiance and wear masks to hide their identities. These masks have magical properties that function only for their intended wearers.": "奥利克人秘密工作，潜入斯特里克斯港，寻找他们的主人所觊觎的魔法，并观察易受影响的学生和心怀怨恨的教师，他们可能会转向他们的事业。奥利克人不遗余力地隐藏他们真正的忠诚，并戴上面具来隐藏自己的身份。这些面具具有神奇的特性，只对其指定的佩戴者起作用。",
	"Oriq recruiters are subtle mages who infiltrate Strixhaven in service to their order. They are adept at blending in, watching for powerful but underperforming mages and students who have fallen through the cracks of the institution. The recruiters approach and befriend these individuals either as potential recruits to the Oriq or as assets who can help the Oriq acquire spells, rare spell components, or knowledge from Strixhaven.": "Oriq的招募者是潜入Strixhaven的法师，为他们的组织服务。他们善于混入人群，观察那些有实力但表现不佳的法师和从机构缝隙中掉出来的学生。招募者会接近并结交这些人，将其作为奥瑞金的潜在新成员，或者作为可以帮助奥瑞金获得法术、稀有法术组件或从斯特里克斯哈文获得知识的资产。",
	"Grumpy, spiky, and generally irritating, pest mascots inhabit the muggy bayou of Sedgemoor. However, these ferret-sized swamp creatures hold deep wells of life essence, making them convenient fuel sources for the magic of Witherbloom mages. As such, many Witherbloom students have adopted pests from the bayou as pets, and pests, in all their spiny glory, have become the mascots of the college.": "脾气暴躁、长满尖刺、普遍令人讨厌的害虫吉祥物居住在Sedgemoor闷热的河口。然而，这些雪貂大小的沼泽生物拥有深厚的生命精华，使它们成为威瑟布洛姆法师魔法的便利燃料来源。因此，许多Witherbloom的学生都把河口的害虫当作宠物，而害虫，在它们所有带刺的荣耀中，已经成为学院的吉祥物。",
	"The students of Prismari College—first as apprentices and then as pledgemages—see no distinction between magic and art. No two Prismari students have the same style of spellcasting; each wields the elemental magic taught by the college in a way that expresses their personality. In the hands of Prismari students, spells that conjure fire or bend water to one's will become vibrant and expressive showcases, thrumming with creative energy.": "Prismari学院的学生--首先是学徒，然后是宣誓法师--认为魔法和艺术之间没有区别。没有两个棱镜学院的学生有相同的施法风格；每个人都以表达自己个性的方式挥舞学院教授的元素魔法。在棱镜学院学生的手中，召唤火焰或使水屈服的法术成为充满活力和表现力的展示品，充满了创造性的能量。",
	"Harnessing the elemental forces of their magic requires precision and grace, and some students dedicate themselves to chasing the ideal of perfect control, hoping that by doing so, they can accurately express what is churning within their minds.": "驾驭他们的魔法元素力量需要精确和优雅，一些学生致力于追逐完美控制的理想，希望通过这样做，他们可以准确地表达他们心中汹涌的东西。",

	"Professors of expression embody the flare of Prismari magic. Using continuous motion, fluid grace, and interweaving steps, these teachers channel the elements of wind, flame, and lightning to accompany them. Their magic is fast and beautiful, which becomes swift death in battle, mesmerizing in its energetic flow. Devastating lightning strikes and searing lashes of flame meet the professors' foes head on.": "表达教授体现了Prismari魔法的耀眼光芒。使用连续的运动、流畅的优雅和交织的步骤，这些教师引导风、火焰和闪电等元素伴随他们。他们的魔法快速而美丽，在战斗中成为迅速的死亡，在其能量流动中令人着迷。毁灭性的雷击和灼热的火焰鞭打与教授们的敌人正面交锋。",

Whether to create a spectacle that an audience will never forget or to strike down their foes in a flash, these teachers impress upon their students the beauty of creation.": "拥护棱镜表达哲学的教授们专注于魔术在当下成为艺术。无论是创造观众永远不会忘记的奇观，还是在瞬间击倒敌人，这些老师都给他们的学生留下了创造之美的印象。",
	"Professors of perfection combine elemental magic with precise, forceful physical motion. Their sweeping gestures and dance-like steps gather the power of crashing waves, conjure the protection of unyielding stone, and shape great structures of ice. Binding and channeling these natural elements allow the professors to mold their environment to their needs, both for breathtaking performances and to control the fabric of a battlefield against their foes.": "完美教授将元素魔法与精确、有力的身体运动相结合。他们挥洒自如的手势和舞蹈般的步伐聚集了波涛汹涌的力量，幻化出不屈的石头的保护，并塑造了巨大的冰雪结构。捆绑和引导这些自然元素使教授们能够根据自己的需要塑造环境，既能进行令人惊叹的表演，又能控制战场上的结构，对抗敌人。",
	"These teachers stress attention to fine details, drilling their students on the most minuscule points. The perfect foundation ultimately leads to a flawless work of art, and the professors of perfection produce sculptural and architectural marvels.": "这些老师强调关注细微的细节，在最微不足道的地方钻研他们的学生。完美的基础最终导致了完美的艺术作品，而完美的教授们产生了雕塑和建筑的奇迹。",
	"The students of Quandrix College—first as apprentices and then as pledgemages—immerse themselves in the magic of geometry and metaphysics. Their ultimate goal isn't mastery, however. Rather, in their projects they explore and expand knowledge without expecting concrete answers. Whether students are extrapolating mathematical patterns in nature or engaging in speculative dives into topological formulas that bend reality, their studies blur the line between abstract numerical theory and natural reality.": "Quandrix学院的学生--首先是作为学徒，然后是作为宣誓法师--沉浸在几何学和形而上学的魔法中。然而，他们的最终目标并不是掌握知识。相反，在他们的项目中，他们探索和扩展知识，而不期望得到具体的答案。无论学生们是在自然界中推断数学模式，还是参与对弯曲现实的拓扑学公式的推测，他们的研究都模糊了抽象的数字理论和自然现实之间的界限。",
	"The scholars of Quandrix College focus on the mathematical principles that govern reality. Through these formulas, they can manipulate properties of matter and space, as well as abstract and conceptual space such as the mind, probability, and the flow of magic itself.": "Quandrix学院的学者们专注于支配现实的数学原理。通过这些公式，他们可以操纵物质和空间的属性，以及抽象和概念性的空间，如思想、概率和魔法本身的流动。",
	"Professors of substance specialize in the concrete side of Quandrix philosophy, manipulating physical dimensions and properties of growth. Their magic alters and replaces the equations that describe the natural world, including creatures, space, and substance. Through these manipulations, the professors change their size and the physical form of others, manipulate nature into rapid growth, travel instantaneously, and even fold space into deadly edges.": "物质教授专门研究Quandrix哲学的具体方面，操纵生长的物理尺寸和属性。他们的魔法改变和取代了描述自然世界的方程式，包括生物、空间和物质。通过这些操纵，教授们可以改变自己和他人的体型，操纵自然界快速增长，瞬间旅行，甚至将空间折叠成致命的边缘。",
	"These professors teach that numbers and mathematics aren't merely intellectual concepts, but that they exist physically in all things. Professors of substance teach their students to wield magic practically, creating tangible change in the world around them.": "这些教授教导说，数字和数学不仅仅是智力上的概念，而是在所有的事物中实际存在。有内涵的教授教他们的学生实际运用魔法，在他们周围的世界中创造切实的变化。",
	"Professors of theory advance the Quandrix philosophy that math-magical manipulation is most powerful in the abstract dimension of minds, probability, and the fabric of magic itself. Their equations shift perceptions in profound ways, alter probability, and interfere with the formation of other magic. In battle, the professors tweak probability to impede attacks and strike at the minds of their foes with lancing equations that disrupt the opponent's resolve.": "理论教授们推进Quandrix哲学，即数学-魔法操纵在思想、概率和魔法本身的抽象维度上是最强大的。他们的方程以深刻的方式改变认知，改变概率，并干扰其他魔法的形成。在战斗中，教授们通过调整概率来阻碍攻击，并通过破坏对手决心的长矛式方程来打击他们的敌人的思想。",
	"Professors of theory hold that altering the way a person interacts with the world can change the world. They impress upon their students to use magic as a tool to shape the overall experience of reality, and in turn make the world a better place.": "理论教授们认为，改变一个人与世界互动的方式可以改变世界。他们给学生的印象是将魔法作为一种工具来塑造现实的整体经验，并反过来使世界变得更美好。",
	"For long expeditions, Lorehold mages often employ relic sloths to haul adventuring equipment and excavated artifacts—so long as their study isn't in any particular hurry. Relic sloths travel at an excruciatingly slow pace, deliberating every step and moving only when necessary. But this caution makes these hulking creatures perfect for traversing treacherous and crumbling ruins, where other beasts of burden would falter. The distinctive sickle-shaped claws on a relic sloth's forelimbs are primarily used for climbing, though they can fend off a hungry predator in a pinch.": "在长时间的探险中，罗尔霍德法师经常雇佣遗迹树懒来拖动冒险设备和挖掘出的文物--只要他们的研究不是特别着急。遗迹树懒以极其缓慢的速度行进，每一步都经过深思熟虑，只有在必要时才会移动。但这种谨慎使这些巨大的生物成为穿越险恶和破碎的废墟的完美选择，而其他的野兽在那里会畏首畏尾。遗迹树懒前肢上独特的镰刀状爪子主要用于攀爬，尽管它们在紧要关头可以抵御饥饿的掠食者。",
	"Created by the archaeomancers of Lorehold College, ruin grinders are mighty automatons built to excavate ancient ruins and artifacts.

	"Some Silverquill students prefer the benevolent side of language, using their words to uplift their friends and illuminate harsh truths about those in power. Others, though, choose to wield words more ruthlessly and master the art of insults and discouragement (and in some cases, petty trash talk).

	"With cheerful dispositions and a knack for walking backward, Strixhaven campus guides lead gaggles of prospective students on tours. The guides' gold and silver chassis are built in shapes reminiscent of the star arches surrounding Strixhaven. Embedded in their chests are holographic maps of the university's campuses, which the guides use to provide directions.
