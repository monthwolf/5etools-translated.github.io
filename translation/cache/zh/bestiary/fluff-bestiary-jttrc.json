As they grow to adulthood, aurumvoraxes hunt on their own, carving out territories they viciously defend.": "在生命的早期，Aurumvoraxes与兄弟姐妹和它们的巢穴领袖父母合作，挖掘隧道以寻找金属和其他钻入式猎物。当它们成长为成年人时，金丝猴会独自狩猎，开辟出自己的领地，狠狠地捍卫。",

	"An aurumvorax is an eight-legged, badger-like hunter. These aggressive omnivores attack any prey they think they can best, ambushing even creatures double their size. They supplement their diets with metal, whether it's worked or ore, and they have a particular taste for gold. This diet lends aurumvorax fur its golden sheen.": "aurumvorax是一种八条腿的、类似獾的猎人。这些好斗的杂食动物会攻击任何它们认为最好的猎物，甚至会伏击比它们大一倍的生物。它们用金属来补充自己的食物，不管是加工过的还是矿石，它们对黄金有一种特别的喜好。这种饮食习惯使aurumvorax的毛发呈现出金色的光泽。",

	"Janya is populated by descendants of Djaynai who escaped into the sea during the Passage of Vultures.

	"More than mere waterway guardians, riverines are embodiments of particular rivers. These spirits of nature take shape to defend their waters and interact with those who travel along their currents. From the waist up, riverines have skin the color of the waters they protect but are otherwise humanlike in appearance.

	"Some riverines enjoy reverence akin to worship. Their likenesses are cast as statues and housed in temples, and worshipers act as agents between the river spirits and the people who revere them. These temples often become the home of the riverine itself, serving as its lair, though other nexuses of power along the river's path—such as its source or a significant waterfall—can also be used as lairs by a riverine.": "有些河神享有类似于崇拜的敬意。他们的形象被铸成雕像，安置在寺庙里，崇拜者在河神和敬仰他们的人之间充当代理人。这些寺庙往往成为河神自己的家，作为它的巢穴，尽管沿河的其他权力中心--如河的源头或重要的瀑布--也可以被河神用作巢穴。",

	"Tlexolotls are gigantic, salamander-like creatures that slumber deep in the magma of dormant volcanoes. A tlexolotl drowses amid the molten depths for centuries, rising only rarely to gorge itself on massive amounts of animal and plant life before returning to its slumber.

A dead whistler appears as a gray, featureless, humanlike biped with long limbs and thin fingers. Those stalked by a whistler can't shut out its soundless, seven-note tune, an otherworldly melody that invades and scourges the mind. Few creatures that encounter a whistler escape; those that do are forever haunted by the stalker's frightful tune.": "呼啸者是难以捉摸的潜行者，他们来自远界的空中，尖锐的边缘。它们很难被看到，因为它们没有被拴在空间的某一点上，在一种永久的物理不确定状态下模糊不清。死去的哨兵看起来是一个灰色的、没有特征的、类似人类的双足动物，有着长长的四肢和细长的手指。那些被哨兵盯上的人无法将其无声的七音调拒之门外，那是一种侵入和祸害心灵的异世界的旋律。遇到哨兵的生物很少能逃脱；那些逃脱的生物则永远被跟踪者可怕的曲调所困扰。",
	"Playful and mischievous, wynlings defend mountain heights and alpine vales against trespassers.

Many travelers return from lands protected by wynlings with stories of vanishing equipment and curious eyes staring from the shadows.": "嬉戏和调皮，温岭人保卫着山峰和高山峡谷，防止入侵者。狼人很少直接面对威胁，他们更喜欢用偷窃和恶作剧的方式骚扰入侵者。许多旅行者从受狼人保护的土地上回来时，都说装备消失了，好奇的眼睛从阴影中盯着他们。",
