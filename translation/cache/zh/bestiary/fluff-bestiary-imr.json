	"The powerful relics possessed by Lynx Creatlach and Sir Ursas (see the \"Special Equipment\" section of their stat blocks) have been granted to them by their diabolical masters, and are not meant to be claimed as treasure. If either agent is killed in the course of the adventure, their special equipment vanishes, returning to Bel or Zariel.": "猞猁Creatlach和Ursas爵士所拥有的强大遗物（见他们的状态块中的 \"特殊装备 \"部分）是由他们邪恶的主人授予的，并不意味着可以被当作宝物来索取。如果任何一个特工在冒险过程中被杀，他们的特殊装备就会消失，回到贝尔或扎里尔手中。",
	"A neo-otyugh is a stronger, more intelligent version of an otyugh—a grotesque aberration sporting three legs, snake-like tentacles, and a perpetually ravenous maw. Like an otyugh, a neo-otyugh buries itself under mounds of offal and carrion to ambush prey. Their improved intellect and innate spellcasting makes them especially effective against humanoid targets, as they use their powers of control to split off a straggler from a party, then attack.": "新奥特尤格是奥特尤格的一个更强大、更聪明的版本--一个怪异的反常者，有三条腿，蛇一样的触角，以及一个永远贪婪的大嘴。和奥特尤格一样，新奥特尤格将自己埋在内脏和腐肉堆下，以伏击猎物。他们改进的智力和天生的法术使他们对人形目标特别有效，因为他们利用自己的控制力从队伍中分出一个散兵游勇，然后进行攻击。",
	"Thessalar was a master alchemist and creator of monsters, whose own blood was said to possess dire magical properties.": "塞萨尔是一位炼金术师和怪物的创造者，据说他自己的血液拥有可怕的魔法特性。",
	"He is vainglorious, egotistical, and utterly ruthless in furthering his research. His career began as a priest in the service of Moloch, where he rose through the ranks before eventually taking over the temple as a working laboratory. Most of his experiments have involved the pursuit of new forms of life, resulting in such creatures as the thessalhydra and the owlbear. In recent years, he has also researched the prolonging of life—namely his own. Thessalar hopes that by becoming a lich, his research and experiments can continue indefinitely.": "他虚荣心强，自负，在推进他的研究方面完全是无情的。他的职业生涯开始于为摩洛神服务的牧师，在那里他不断晋升，最终接管了作为工作实验室的神庙。他的大部分实验都涉及到对新的生命形式的追求，产生了诸如thessalhydra和猫头鹰熊等生物。近年来，他还研究了延长生命的问题，尤其是他自己的生命。塞萨尔希望通过成为一个巫师，他的研究和实验可以无限期地继续下去。",
	"Over time, Thessalar has subjected himself to so many of his own experiments that his blood has taken on alchemical and magical properties. He regularly uses it as the basis for many of the reagents used throughout his labs.": "随着时间的推移，塞萨尔让自己接受了许多自己的实验，他的血液已经具有了炼金术和魔法的特性。他经常用它作为他整个实验室中使用的许多试剂的基础。",
	"A thessalheart construct is created with a connection to the life energy of another creature, allowing that creature to regenerate back from the dead as long as the construct is not destroyed. The artificer Thessalar created this crafty construct, and uses it to imbue his greater monstrous creations with even more power.": "Thessalheart构筑物是通过与另一个生物的生命能量相连接而产生的，只要构筑物不被破坏，该生物就能从死亡中重生。工匠塞萨尔创造了这种狡猾的构造，并利用它来为他更大的怪物创造物注入更多的力量。",
	"The alchemist Thessalar created unknown numbers of misshapen magical creatures, including his many thessalbeasts. Among the largest was the thessalkraken—a slightly smaller variant of the legendary kraken, resembling that great tentacled titan but with a jagged-toothed maw that drips constantly with acid.": "炼金术士塞萨尔创造了数量不详的畸形魔法生物，包括他的许多thessalbeasts。其中最大的是thessalkraken--传说中的克拉肯的一个稍小的变种，类似于那个巨大的触手式泰坦，但有一个锯齿状的大嘴，不断地滴着酸液。",
	"A thessalkraken lives in the dark depths, usually a sunken rift or a cavern filled with detritus, treasure, and the remains of sacrificial victims.": "西索克拉肯生活在黑暗的深处，通常是一个下沉的裂缝或一个充满残渣、财宝和牺牲者遗体的洞穴。"
