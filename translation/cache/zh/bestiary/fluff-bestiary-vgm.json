	"Abjurers are specialist wizards who feel secure when warded by layers of magical power. Kings, nobles, and other wealthy individuals commonly hire abjurers to cast protective spells on their homes and vaults.": "Abjurers是专业的巫师，他们在层层魔法力量的守护下感到安全。国王、贵族和其他富有的人通常会雇佣堕落者对他们的家和金库施以保护性的咒语。",
	"Mind flayers that pursue arcane magic are exiled as deviants, and for them no eternal communion with an elder brain is possible. The road to lichdom offers a way to escape the permanency of death, but that path is long and solitary. Alhoons are mind flayers that use a shortcut.": "追求奥术魔法的心灵传播者被当作异类放逐，对他们来说，不可能与长者的大脑进行永恒的交流。通往巫术王国的道路提供了一种逃避死亡永恒的方法，但这条道路是漫长而孤独的。Alhoons是使用捷径的心灵传播者。",
	" Elder brains forbid mind flayers from pursuing magic power aside from psionics, but it isn't an interdiction they must often enforce. Illithids brook no masters but members of their own kind, so it isn't in their nature to bow to any god or otherworldly patron. However, wizardry remains a rare temptation.": " 长老们的大脑禁止心灵传播者追求除幻术以外的魔法力量，但这并不是他们必须经常执行的禁令。伊利特人除了自己的同类外，不接受任何主人，所以向任何神或其他世界的守护者低头并不是他们的天性。然而，巫术仍然是一种罕见的诱惑。",
	"In the pages of a spellbook, an illithid sees a system to acquire authority. Through the writings of the wizard who penned it, the illithid perceives the workings of a highly intelligent mind. Most mind flayers who find a spellbook react with abhorrence or indifference, but for some a spellbook is a gateway to a new way of thinking.": "在咒语书的书页中，illithid看到了一个获得权威的系统。通过撰写这本书的巫师的著作，illithid人看到了一个高度智慧的头脑的运作。大多数发现咒语书的幻术师的反应是憎恶或漠不关心，但对一些人来说，咒语书是通往新思维方式的大门。",
	"For a time, the study of such forbidden texts can be hidden from other illithids and even from an elder brain. Understanding of wizardry eludes the mind like a living thing. Yet eventually, understanding comes, and a mind flayer arcanist must accept itself as deviant and flee the colony if it is to live.": "有一段时间，对这种禁忌文本的研究可以瞒着其他illithids，甚至瞒着长者的大脑。对巫术的理解就像一个活物一样躲避着心灵。然而，最终，理解会到来，如果要活下来，一个掠夺心灵的奥术师必须接受自己是异类，并逃离殖民地。",
	"Confronting this awful reality, a group of nine mind flayer deviants used their arcane magic and psionics to weave a new truth. These nine called themselves the alhoon, and ever afterward, all those who follow in their footsteps have been referred to by the same name.": "面对这个可怕的现实，一群由九名心灵分裂者组成的团体用他们的奥秘魔法和幻术编织了一个新的真理。这九个人称自己为alhoon，此后，所有追随他们脚步的人都被称为同一个名字。",
	"Initially, an alhoon can be difficult to distinguish from a normal mind flayer. The most obvious difference is the lack of the mind flayer's ever-present mucus coating. Without that protection, an alhoon's skin becomes dry and cracked. Its eyes might appear shriveled and sunken. Both of these clues are easily missed by someone who hasn't seen a mind flayer. However, in short order, an alhoon's flesh withers away and its empty eye sockets gleam with cold pinpricks of light like other liches.": "起初，alhoon很难与普通读心者区分开来。最明显的区别是，它没有弑心者永远存在的粘液涂层。没有这种保护，Alhoon的皮肤会变得干燥和开裂。它的眼睛可能会显得干瘪和凹陷。这两个线索都很容易被没有见过噬心者的人错过。然而，在很短的时间内，alhoon的肉体就会枯萎，其空洞的眼窝会像其他地衣一样闪耀着冰冷的针尖之光。",
	"The undeath conferred by a periapt of mind trapping lasts only so long as the life of the living victim selected. Thus an alhoon who brought a 200-year-old elf to be sacrificed looks forward to a much longer existence than one that sacrifices a 35-year-old person. Alhoons can extend their existence by repeating the ritual with new victims, effectively resetting the clocks for themselves.": "心灵诱捕术所赋予的不死之身只持续到所选择的活体受害者的生命。因此，带着200岁的精灵来献祭的alhoon期待着比献祭35岁的人更长久的存在。Alhoons可以通过与新的受害者重复这个仪式来延长他们的存在，有效地为自己重新设置时钟。",
	"Destruction of a periapt of mind trapping consigns those trapped within it to oblivion, and thus alhoons often work together to create elaborate protections about the periapt and their preferred ritual site. Sometimes a single alhoon is entrusted with the periapt of mind trapping, but this is a dangerous proposition. Anyone who holds the periapt of mind trapping gains advantage on attacks, saves, and check against the alhoons associated with its creation, and those alhoons in turn suffer disadvantage on attacks, saves, and check against the holder.": "破坏思维陷阱的periapt会使被困在里面的人被遗忘，因此alhoons经常一起工作，对periapt和他们喜欢的仪式地点进行精心保护。有时，只有一个alhoon被委托保管思维陷阱的periapt，但这是一个危险的提议。任何持有心灵陷阱periapt的人都会在攻击、拯救和检查中对与之相关的alhoons产生优势，而这些alhoons反过来在攻击、拯救和检查中对持有者产生不利。",
	"In addition, the holder of the periapt can telepathically communicate with any sacrificed soul trapped within, and alhoons within the periapt can speak telepathically with the holder. A creature carrying the periapt can't prevent communication from alhoons but can silence trapped souls.": "此外，periapt的持有者可以与被困在其中的任何牺牲的灵魂进行心灵感应，periapt中的alhoons可以与持有者进行心灵感应。携带periapt的生物不能阻止alhoons的交流，但可以让被困的灵魂安静下来。",
	" Arcanist deviants that taste freedom from the colony react in a variety of ways. Some prize their privacy, others seek to commune with similar minds, and still others seek to dominate a colony, elevating themselves to the position of leadership normally held by an elder brain. Regardless of the arcanist's personal inclinations, it faces the same stark fact: When it dies, it will not join the host of minds in the elder brain. Deviant minds are never accepted as part of the collective. For it, death means oblivion.": " 尝到了从群体中获得自由的奥术师异类，会有各种不同的反应。一些人珍视自己的隐私，另一些人则寻求与类似的思想交流，还有一些人则试图主宰一个群体，将自己提升到通常由长老的大脑担任的领导位置。无论奥术师的个人倾向如何，它都面临着同一个严峻的事实：当它死亡时，它不会加入长老大脑中的心智宿主。偏差的心智永远不会被接受为集体的一部分。对它来说，死亡意味着遗忘。",
	" Lichdom offers salvation and the prospect of being able to pursue knowledge indefinitely. Having feasted on the brains of people when alive, a mind flayer has no compunction about feeding souls to a phylactery. The only hindrance to a mind flayer becoming a lich is the means, which is a secret some mind flayer arcanists stop at nothing to discover. Yet lichdom requires an arcane spellcaster to be at the apex of power, something many mind flayers find is far from their grasps.": " Lichdom提供了救赎和可以无限期地追求知识的前景。噬心者在活着的时候以人的大脑为食，对于将灵魂喂给法器没有任何顾虑。弑心者成为巫师的唯一障碍是手段，这也是一些弑心者奥术师不惜一切代价要发现的秘密。然而，巫师之国需要一个奥术师达到力量的顶点，而许多噬心者发现这一点远非他们所能掌握。",
	" Alhoons can cooperate in the creation of a periapt of mind trapping, a fist-sized container made of silver, emerald, and amethyst. The process requires at least three mind flayer arcanists and the sacrifice of an equal number of souls from living victims in a three-day-long ritual of spellcasting and psionic communion. Upon its completion, free-willed undeath is conferred on the mind flayers, turning them into alhoons.": " Alhoons可以合作创造一个心灵陷阱的periapt，一个由银、绿宝石和紫水晶制成的拳头大小的容器。这个过程需要至少3个心灵传播者奥术师，并在为期3天的法术和灵能交流仪式中牺牲同等数量的活体受害者的灵魂。仪式完成后，自由意志的死亡被赋予了思想絮乱者，使他们变成了阿尔霍恩。",
	" Unlike with true lichdom, the periapt of mind trapping doesn't restore the alhoons to undeath if they are destroyed. Instead, a destroyed alhoon's mind is transferred to the periapt where it remains in communion with any other trapped alhoon minds, as well as the souls of those sacrificed.": " 与真正的Lichdom不同，如果Alhoons被摧毁，思维陷阱的periapt不会使其恢复到不死状态。相反，被摧毁的alhoon的思想会被转移到periapt，在那里它与任何其他被困住的alhoon思想以及被牺牲的人的灵魂保持交流。",
	"Annis hags lair in mountains or hills. Despite being hunchbacked and hump-shouldered, they are the largest and most physically imposing of their kind, standing eight feet tall.": "安尼斯女巫的巢穴在山区或丘陵。尽管他们是驼背和驼肩，但他们是同类中最大和最强壮的，身高达8英尺。",
	" Although annis hags can easily tear a grown man apart, they love hunting children, preferring their flesh above all others. They use the flayed skin of such victims to make supple leather, and a hag's lair often shows the signs of this industry.": " 尽管女巫可以轻易地把一个成年男人撕碎，但她们喜欢猎杀儿童，喜欢他们的肉体胜过其他一切。他们用这种受害者的剥皮来制作柔软的皮革，而女巫的巢穴往往显示出这种产业的痕迹。",
	"Annis hags leave tokens of their cruelty at the edges of forests and other areas they claim. In this way, they provoke fear and paranoia in nearby villages and settlements. To an annis hag, nothing is sweeter than turning a vibrant community into a place paralyzed with terror, where folk never venture out at night, strangers are met with suspicion and anger, and parents warn their children to \"be good, or the annis will get you.\"": "安尼斯女巫在森林和其他他们声称的地区的边缘留下了他们残忍的标记。通过这种方式，他们在附近的村庄和定居点挑起恐惧和偏执。对Annis hag来说，没有什么比把一个充满活力的社区变成一个被恐惧麻痹的地方更甜蜜的了，在那里，人们从不在晚上冒险，陌生人会受到怀疑和愤怒，父母会警告他们的孩子 \"要乖，否则Annis会抓你\"。",
	" When an annis feels especially cruel, she disguises herself as a kindly-looking elderly woman, approaches a child in a remote place, and gives it an iron token that it can use to confide in her. Over time, \"Granny\" convinces the child that it's okay to have bad thoughts and do bad deeds-starting with breaking things or wandering outside without permission, then graduating to pushing someone down the stairs or setting a house on fire. Sooner or later, the child's family and community become terrified of the \"bad seed\" and must face the awful decision of whether the child should be punished or exiled.": " 当一个年人觉得自己特别残忍时，她会把自己伪装成一个看起来很慈祥的老人，在一个偏远的地方接近一个孩子，并给他一个铁制的信物，让他向她倾诉。随着时间的推移，\"奶奶 \"让孩子相信有坏想法和做坏事是可以的--从打破东西或未经允许在外面闲逛开始，然后发展到把人推下楼梯或放火烧房子。迟早有一天，孩子的家庭和社区会对这个 \"坏种子 \"感到恐惧，必须面对这个孩子是否应该受到惩罚或被流放的可怕决定。",
	" Much in the way that they befriend children in order to corrupt them, annis hags have a tendency for adopting a group of ogres, trolls, or other loutish creatures, ruling them through brute strength, verbal abuse, and superstition.": " 就像他们为了腐蚀孩子而与孩子交朋友一样，女巫有一种倾向，就是收养一群食人魔、巨魔或其他粗野的生物，通过蛮力、辱骂和迷信来统治他们。",
	" An annis hag that is part of a coven (see the \"Hag Covens\" sidebar in the Monster Manual) has a challenge rating of 8 (3,900 XP).": " 属于女巫团的女巫（见《怪物手册》的 \"女巫团 \"侧栏）的挑战等级为8（3900XP）。",
	"An annis hag can pull out one of her iron teeth or nails and spend 1 minute shaping and polishing it into the form of a coin, a ring, or a tiny mirror. Thereafter, any creature that holds this iron token can have a whispered conversation with the hag, provided the creature and the hag are on the same plane of existence and within 10 miles of each other. The holder of the token can hear only the hag's voice, not those of any other creatures or any ambient noise around the hag. Similarly, the hag can hear the holder of the token and not the noise around it.": "女巫可以拔出她的一颗铁牙或铁钉，花1分钟将其塑造成硬币、戒指或小镜子的形状。此后，任何持有这个铁质信物的生物都可以和女巫进行低声交谈，前提是该生物和女巫在同一个存在平面上，并且彼此相距10英里以内。持有令牌的人只能听到女巫的声音，而不能听到其他生物的声音或女巫周围的任何环境噪音。同样地，老巫婆也能听到令牌持有者的声音，而不是它周围的噪音。",
	"A hag can have up to three iron tokens active at one time. As an action, she can discern the direction and approximate distance to all of her active tokens. She can instantaneously deactivate any of her tokens at any distance (no action required), whereupon the token retains its current form but loses its magical properties.": "一个巫婆在同一时间最多可以有三个铁质令牌。作为一个行动，她可以辨别她所有的活动令牌的方向和大致距离。她可以在任何距离上瞬间停用她的任何令牌（无需行动），这时令牌会保留其当前的形式，但失去其魔法属性。",

	"Archdruids watch over the natural wonders of their domains. They seldom interact with civilized folk unless there is a great threat to the natural order.

	"Bahgtru, son of Gruumsh and Luthic, is the orc deity of unbridled strength. Legend says Bahgtru needed a mount as fierce as him for making war, so he sought a mighty aurochs, subjugated the creature with his bare hands, and hauled it to Nishrek, Gruumsh's realm. Bahgtru named the beast Kazaht, or \"Bull\" in Orc. On Kazaht's bare back, Bahgtru charges into battle, ramming into an enemy host and leaping over the aurochs's horns to land in the midst of his foes.": "巴赫鲁（Bahgtru）是格鲁姆什（Gruumsh）和卢斯克（Luthic）的儿子，是兽人的神灵，具有不羁的力量。传说中，Bahgtru需要一匹和他一样凶猛的坐骑来打仗，所以他寻找了一头强大的牛，徒手征服了这头牛，并把它拖到了Nishrek，Gruumsh的王国。巴赫鲁给这只野兽取名为卡扎特，也就是兽语中的 \"公牛\"。巴赫鲁骑在卡扎特的背上，冲进战场，冲进敌人的包围圈，跃过驼鸟的犄角，落在敌人的中间。",

	"A babau demon possesses the cunning of a devil and the bloodthirstiness of a demon. It has leathery black skin pulled tight over its gaunt frame, and a curved horn protruding from the back of its elongated skull.

	"A banderhobb is a hybrid of shadow and flesh. Through dark magic, these components take on an enormous and vile humanoid shape, resembling a bipedal toad. In this form, a banderhobb temporarily serves its creator as a thug, a thief, and a kidnapper.": "班德霍布是一个影子和肉体的混合体。通过黑暗魔法，这些成分呈现出一种巨大而卑鄙的人形，类似于双足蟾蜍的形状。在这种形态下，班德霍布暂时为它的创造者服务，成为一个暴徒、小偷和绑架者。",
	" In the earliest days of the world, a coven of night hags devised a ritual that led to the creation of the first banderhobb. A hag that knows the ritual might be willing to teach it for the right price. Some other dark fey and powerful fiends also know of the process, as do a few mortal mages. Instructions might also be found in a tome devoted to debased wizardry.": " 在世界最早的时候，一个夜行女巫团设计了一个仪式，导致了第一个班德霍布的产生。知道这个仪式的女巫可能愿意以合适的价格来教授它。其他一些黑暗精灵和强大的魔人也知道这个过程，一些凡人法师也知道。在一本专门介绍堕落巫术的书中也可以找到说明。",
	"A banderhobb fulfills its duties until its existence ends. When it expires, usually several days after its birth, it leaves behind only tarry goo and wisps of shadow. Legends tell of a dark tower in the Shadowfell where the shadows sometimes reform, and banderhobbs roam.": "一个Banderhobb履行其职责，直到其存在结束。当它过期时，通常是在它出生后的几天，它只留下了焦油状的粘液和一缕阴影。传说中，影子谷有一座黑暗的塔，那里的影子有时会被改造，而班德霍布则在那里游荡。",
	" When the ritual to create a banderhobb is complete, flesh, spirit, and shadow combine to produce a creature as big as an ogre. The newly formed monstrosity has spindly limbs that belie great strength. Its broad maw holds a long tongue and rows of fangs, both of which it uses to grab and swallow a creature or perhaps an object the banderhobb intends to steal. Despite its size, a banderhobb makes little noise, moving as silently as the shadows that infuse it. A banderhobb isn't capable of speech, but it can understand orders given to it by its creator and communicates with nearby banderhobbs in a psychic manner.": " 当创造班德霍布的仪式完成后，肉体、精神和阴影结合在一起，产生了一个像食人魔一样大的生物。这个新形成的怪物有着细小的四肢，但却掩盖了巨大的力量。它宽大的嘴里有一条长长的舌头和一排獠牙，它用这两样东西来抓住并吞下一个生物，或者是一个banderhobb想偷的东西。尽管它体型庞大，但班德霍布很少发出声音，它的行动就像注入它的阴影一样无声无息。班德霍布没有说话的能力，但它能理解它的创造者给它的命令，并以通灵的方式与附近的班德霍布交流。",
	" During its brief existence, a banderhobb attempts to carry out the bidding of the one who birthed it. It accomplishes its mission with no concern for the harm it suffers or creates. Its only desire is to serve and succeed. A banderhobb that is assigned to track down a target is particularly dangerous when it is provided with a lock of hair, a personal belonging, or other object connected to the target. Possession of such an item allows it to sense the creature's location from as far as a mile away.": " 在其短暂的存在期间，Banderhobb试图执行孕育它的人的命令。它在完成自己的使命时，并不关心它所遭受或创造的伤害。它的唯一愿望是服务和成功。被指派追踪目标的班德霍布，如果得到一绺头发、个人物品或其他与目标有关的物品，就特别危险。拥有这样的物品可以让它在一英里外感知生物的位置。",

	"The mission of every barghest, implanted in it by the General of Gehenna, is to consume seventeen goblinoid souls by devouring the bodies of those it kills. Souls consumed in this way are prevented from joining Maglubiyet's forces in Acheron. Why seventeen?

	"A barghest hungers for the day when it can complete its mission, return to Gehenna, and serve the General directly in his yugoloth legions, but it doesn't kill goblinoids indiscriminately. By devouring the souls of goblinoid leaders and other powerful individuals, rather than lowly goblins, a barghest earns elevated status in the afterlife. Barghests typically keep their true nature secret, preying upon a goblin or two when the opportunity arises, until they reach adult age and are old and strong enough to seek out stronger prey. When goblins discover that a barghest is among them, they react with groveling obeisance, each member of the tribe eager to show the barghest that it isn't worthy of being devoured.": "Barghest渴望有一天能完成它的使命，回到地府，在他的yugoloth军团中直接为将军服务，但它不会不分青红皂白地杀死哥布林人。通过吞噬地精领袖和其他有权势的人的灵魂，而不是低级的地精，Barghest在来世赢得了更高的地位。Barghests通常对自己的真实本性保密，在有机会的时候捕食一两只妖精，直到他们达到成年年龄，老而弥坚，足以寻找更强大的猎物。当妖精们发现有一个巴吉斯特在他们中间时，他们的反应是卑躬屈膝的服从，部落的每个成员都渴望向巴吉斯特表明它不值得被吞噬。",
	"A barghest avoids contact with large, open fires. Any conflagration larger than its body acts as a gateway to Gehenna and banishes the fiend to that plane, where it is likely to be slain or enslaved by a yugoloth for its failure.": "Barghest避免接触大的、开放的火。任何比它的身体更大的火焰都会成为通往地狱的通道，并将恶魔驱逐到那个平面，在那里它很可能会因为失败而被杀死或被尤戈洛人奴役。",
	"A barghest can feed on the corpse of a humanoid that it killed that has been dead for less than 10 minutes, devouring both flesh and soul in doing so.

If the barghest dies before the soul is digested, the soul is released.": "Barghest可以在它杀死的死了不到10分钟的人形生物的尸体上进食，在此过程中同时吞噬肉体和灵魂。这种进食至少需要1分钟，而且会摧毁受害者的身体。受害者的灵魂会被困在barghest中24小时，之后会被消化掉。如果barghest在灵魂被消化之前死亡，灵魂就会被释放。",
	"While a humanoid's soul is trapped in a barghest, any form of revival that could work has only a {@chance 50|50 percent} chance of doing so, freeing the soul from the barghest if it is successful.

	" Bheur hags are attracted to selfish actions justified by deadly cold, such as murdering a traveler for a winter coat, chopping down a dryad's grove for firewood, and so on.

	"A bheur hag loves watching unprepared people suffer and die for their mistakes during the winter. She is delighted when mortals make petty, pathetic attempts to survive, such as eating boots and leather scraps when no real food is to be found.": "巫婆喜欢看着毫无准备的人在冬天为他们的错误受苦和死亡。她很高兴看到凡人为了生存而做出琐碎的、可悲的尝试，例如在找不到真正的食物时吃靴子和皮革碎片。",
	" When a bheur hag is fully in the throes of combat and has recently slain one of her foes, she often forgoes a direct attack on her remaining enemies and instead takes a moment to feed on the corpse, dismembering it and tearing meat from bone.

Any one of these bodaks can turn a slain mortal into a bodak with its gaze. Like each Hierophant of Annihilation, every bodak bears the mark of Orcus as a chest wound, an opening where a mortal humanoid's heart would be.": "奥克斯在深渊中用七个信徒创造了第一批波达克，他们被称为 \"湮灭之神\"（Hierophants of Annihilation）。这些人物，像巴洛尔一样强大，有自由意志，但直接为不死王子服务。任何一个波达克都可以用它的目光将被杀的凡人变成波达克。和每个毁灭之神一样，每个波达克都有奥库斯的标记，即胸口的伤口，一个凡人的心脏的开口。",
	"Orcus can recall anything a bodak sees or hears. If he so chooses, he can speak through a bodak to address his enemies and followers directly. Bodaks are extensions of Orcus's will outside the Abyss, serving the demon prince's aims and other minions.": "奥库斯可以回忆起波达克看到或听到的任何东西。如果他愿意，他可以通过波达克直接对他的敌人和追随者说话。波达克是奥库斯意志在深渊之外的延伸，为恶魔王子的目标和其他爪牙服务。",
	"Even nature despises bodaks. The sun burns away a bodak's tainted flesh. The creature's gaze lays waste to the living. Anyone a bodak slays with its gaze withers, its face frozen in a mask of terror. The monster's mere presence is so unnatural that it chills the soul. Animals untrained for war instinctively flee just before a bodak arrives.": "甚至自然界也看不起波达克。太阳烧掉了波达克的污秽的肉体。这种生物的目光会浪费生命。任何被波达克的目光杀死的人都会枯萎，他们的脸被冻结在一个恐怖的面具中。这个怪物的存在是如此的不自然，以至于让人的灵魂感到寒冷。没有经过战争训练的动物在波达克到来之前就会本能地逃跑。",
	" A bodak retains vague impressions of its past life. It seeks out both its former allies and its former enemies to destroy them, as its warped soul seeks to erase anything connected to its former life. Minions of Orcus are the one exception to this compulsion; a bodak recognizes them as kindred souls and spares them from its wrath. Anyone who knew the individual before its transformation into a bodak can recognize mannerisms or other subtle clues to its original identity.": " 波达克保留着对其过去生活的模糊印象。它既寻找以前的盟友，也寻找以前的敌人来摧毁他们，因为它扭曲的灵魂试图抹去任何与它以前生活有关的东西。奥库斯的奴仆是这种强迫性的一个例外；波达克将他们视为同类的灵魂，并将他们从它的愤怒中拯救出来。任何在它变成波达克之前认识它的人都能认出它的行为举止或其他关于其原始身份的微妙线索。",
	" The soul of a creature that becomes a bodak is so damaged that it is unfit for most forms of magical resurrection. Only a {@spell wish} spell or similar magic can return a bodak to its former life.": " 变成波达克的生物的灵魂受到了极大的伤害，不适合大多数形式的魔法复活。只有{@spell wish}的咒语或类似的魔法才能使波达克恢复到它以前的生活。",
	" A bodak doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": " 波达克不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Boggles are the little bogeys of fairy tales. They lurk in the fringes of the Feywild and are also found on the Material Plane, where they hide under beds and in closets, waiting to frighten and bedevil folk with their mischief.": "Boggles是童话故事中的小妖怪。它们潜伏在精灵世界的边缘地带，在物质世界也能找到，它们藏在床底下和壁橱里，等待着用它们的恶作剧来吓唬和困扰人们。",
	"A boggle is born out of feelings of loneliness, materializing in a place where the Feywild touches the world in proximity to an intelligent being that feels isolated or abandoned. For example, a forsaken child might unintentionally conjure a boggle and see it as a sort of imaginary friend. A boggle might also appear in the attic of a lonely widower's house or in the caves of a hermit.": "Boggle是在孤独感中诞生的，在Feywild接触世界的地方出现，接近一个感到被孤立或被遗弃的智能生物。例如，一个被遗弃的孩子可能无意中变出一个博格，并将其视为一种想象中的朋友。博格也可能出现在一个孤独的鳏夫家的阁楼上或一个隐士的山洞里。",
	" Boggles engage in petty pranks to amuse themselves, passing the time at their hosts' expense. A boggle isn't above breaking dishes, hiding tools, making frightening sounds to startle cows and sour their milk, or hiding a baby in an attic. Although a boggle's antics might cause distress and unintentional harm, mischief-not mayhem-is usually its intent. If threatened, a boggle flees rather than stand and fight.": " Boggle会搞一些小的恶作剧来自娱自乐，用主人的钱来打发时间。Boggle不会打碎盘子，藏起工具，发出吓人的声音来惊吓奶牛，使它们的牛奶变酸，或者把婴儿藏在阁楼上。虽然博格犬的滑稽行为可能会造成困扰和无意的伤害，但恶作剧--而不是混乱--通常是它的目的。如果受到威胁，博格犬会逃跑，而不是站着战斗。",
	" A boggle excretes an oil from its pores and can make its oil slippery or sticky. The oil dries up and disappears an hour later.": " Boggle从其毛孔中排泄出一种油，可以使其油变得滑溜溜的或粘稠。这种油会在一小时后变干并消失。",
	" A boggle can create magical openings to travel short distances or to pilfer items that would otherwise be beyond its reach. To create such a rift in space, a boggle must be adjacent to a space defined by a frame, such as an open window or a doorway, a gap between the bars of a cage, or the opening between the feet of a bed and the floor. The rift is invisible and disappears after a few seconds-enough time for the boggle to step, reach, or attack through it.": " 博格可以创造出神奇的开口来进行短距离的旅行，或者偷窃本来无法触及的物品。要在空间中创造这样的裂缝，博格必须与一个由框架定义的空间相邻，比如一个开放的窗户或门洞，笼子的栅栏之间的缝隙，或者床脚和地板之间的开口。裂缝是不可见的，几秒钟后就会消失--足够的时间让博格通过它进行踩踏、接触或攻击。",
	" A boggle makes a decent servant for a strong-willed master, and wicked creatures such as fomorians and hags sometimes shelter boggles in their lairs. Warlocks who form pacts with archfey have also been known to command boggles, and charismatic individuals who make the right offers have enjoyed temporary alliances with these little tricksters. A bored boggle always finds some way to entertain itself.": " 对于一个意志坚强的主人来说，博格是一个体面的仆人，而邪恶的生物，如fomorians和hag有时会在他们的巢穴里庇护博格。与大帝结成盟约的术士也会指挥博格，而有魅力的人只要提供合适的条件，就能与这些小捣蛋鬼结成临时联盟。无聊的博格总是能找到一些方法来娱乐自己。",
	"This goblin is a sorcerer with the wild magic origin whose every casting, including cantrips, is accompanied by a wild magic surge. Each time the goblin casts a spell, there is an accompanying surge of wild magic; roll on the {@table Wild Magic Surge|PHB} table in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} to determine the wild magic effect.": "这个妖精是一个拥有野生魔法起源的巫师，他的每一次施法，包括咒语，都伴随着野生魔法的涌动。每次妖精施法时，都会伴随着野性魔法的激增；在{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的{@table Wild Magic Surge|PHB}表上滚动，以确定野性魔法的效果。",
	"This goblin served under a hobgoblin wizard, stole a look at its master's spellbook, and learned a little wizardry by aping the gestures and words it remembered. The goblin can cast a randomly determined 1st-level wizard spell once per day. Intelligence is its spellcasting ability.": "这个地精在一个地精巫师手下工作，偷看了它主人的法术书，并通过模仿它记忆中的手势和语言学会了一点巫术。这只地精每天可以施放一次随机决定的一级巫师法术。智力是它的法术能力。",

	"Spellcasters of any sort among the goblins are rare. Goblins typically lack the intelligence and patience needed to learn and practice wizardry, and they fare poorly even when given access to the necessary training and knowledge. Sorcerers are less prevalent among them than in many other races, and Khurgorbaeyag seems to dislike sharing his divine power with his followers. And although many goblins would readily offer anything to have the abilities of a warlock, the patrons that grant such power know a goblin is unlikely to be able to uphold its end of any bargain.": "妖精中的任何类型的施法者都是罕见的。妖精通常缺乏学习和练习巫术所需的智慧和耐心，即使获得了必要的训练和知识，他们的表现也很差。巫师在他们中间比许多其他种族要少，而且Khurgorbaeyag似乎不喜欢与他的信徒分享他的神力。尽管许多地精愿意提供任何东西来获得术士的能力，但授予这种力量的赞助人知道地精不太可能坚持其在任何交易中的立场。",
	"Even when a goblin is born with the ability to become a spellcaster, the knowledge and talent necessary to carry on the tradition rarely persists for more than a couple of generations. Because they have so little experience with magic, goblins make no distinction between its forms. To them all magic is \"booyahg,\" and the word is part of the name they give to any of its practitioners.": "即使一个地精生来就有成为施法者的能力，但继承传统所需的知识和天赋很少能持续超过几代。因为他们对魔法的经验太少，地精对魔法的形式不加区分。对他们来说，所有的魔法都是 \"booyahg\"，而且这个词是他们给任何魔法从业者的名字的一部分。",
	"A goblin with access to booyahg becomes a member of the lashers and can often rise to the role of boss.": "能够接触到booyahg的地精就会成为lashers的成员，并经常可以上升到老板的角色。",
	"This massive four-legged dinosaur is large enough that most predators leave it alone. Its deadly tail can drive away or kill smaller threats.": "这种巨大的四足恐龙体型庞大，大多数捕食者都会放过它。它致命的尾巴可以赶走或杀死较小的威胁。",
	"The catoblepas is as loathsome as the vile swamplands in which it lives. Like such wastelands, this conglomeration of bloated buffalo, dinosaur, warthog, and hippopotamus parts has few redeeming qualities. Few travelers willingly traverse the territory of a catoblepas.": "鲶鱼和它所生活的卑鄙的沼泽地一样令人厌恶。像这样的荒地一样，这种由臃肿的水牛、恐龙、疣猪和河马的部分组成的集合体几乎没有什么值得称赞的地方。很少有旅行者愿意穿越猫头鹰的领地。",
	" Despite their ungainly physiology, catoblepases resemble natural beasts. A catoblepas behaves much like an animal, too, ambling through its marshy home, munching choice vegetation, eating the occasional bit of carrion, and wallowing in mire. A catoblepas might be found with the one mate it chooses for life and, on occasion, a calf. Especially if it's guarding its young, a catoblepas attacks anyone that moves too close.": " 尽管它们的生理结构很不雅观，但猫鼬与自然界的野兽很相似。鲶鱼的行为也很像动物，在其沼泽地的家中漫步，啃食选择的植物，偶尔吃一点腐肉，并在泥沼中沉溺。一只catoblepas可能会和它选择的一个伴侣一起生活，有时还会有一只小牛。特别是当它在保护它的孩子时，猫鼬会攻击任何太靠近它的人。",
	"Sages say that gods of pestilence and rot created catoblepases as embodiments of their influence. Whatever the origin of the creature, stories link the catoblepas to misfortune, and many of these yarns have elements of truth. Some such tales claim that hags tend catoblepases like cattle, and that a swamp that contains a catoblepas might also be home to a hag that drinks the monster's milk. Although a particular catoblepas might not be linked to a hag, a coven of hags might keep one or more of these beasts as guardians or pets. Other legends say that those of impure heart can tame a catoblepas. Indeed, some tales have circulated of malevolent warlocks and dark knights who have discovered how to domesticate the beasts and use them as mounts.": "圣人说，瘟疫和腐烂之神创造了catoblepases，作为他们影响的化身。无论这种生物的起源是什么，各种故事都将catoblepas与不幸联系在一起，而其中许多故事都有真实的成分。一些这样的故事声称，女巫像照顾牛一样照顾catoblepases，而包含catoblepas的沼泽也可能是喝怪物奶水的女巫的家。虽然某只catoblepas可能与女巫没有关系，但女巫团可能会饲养一只或多只这样的野兽作为守护者或宠物。还有一些传说说，那些心地不纯的人可以驯服catoblepas。事实上，一些流传着恶毒的术士和黑暗骑士的故事，他们发现了如何驯化这些野兽并将其作为坐骑。",
	" A catoblepas's stink, like that of death mixed with swamp gas and skunk musk, gives it away as being much more ghastly than its appearance suggests. When it is on the attack, a catoblepas reveals the extent of its horrific nature. The creature's serpentine neck has trouble lifting its head, but one glare from its bloodshot eyes can rot flesh. At the end of its tail is a club that can rattle body and soul if it strikes true, leaving a victim unable to act. If the target of its attacks dies, the catoblepas feasts on the fresh remains.": " Catoblepas的臭味，就像死亡与沼泽气体和臭鼬麝香的混合，让人觉得它比它的外表所显示的要可怕得多。当它处于攻击状态时，catoblepas就会显示出它的恐怖性质。这种生物的蛇形颈部很难抬起它的头，但它那充满血丝的眼睛一瞪，就能让肉体腐烂。在它的尾巴末端有一根棍子，如果它真的击中了，可以使身体和灵魂摇晃，使受害者无法行动。如果它的攻击目标死了，catoblepas会以新鲜的遗体为食。",
	" A catoblepas's nature as a creature of disease and decay brings out similar characteristics in the creature's swampy habitat. Such a wetland becomes gloomy, tangled, and more fetid than it was before. Beneficial qualities of the environment, such as healing herbs and clean water, diminish when a catoblepas lives nearby. Swamp gases have a hint of the catoblepas's foulness to them. Animals in the area are more aggressive and liable to be diseased. Degenerate creatures are likely to take up residence near a catoblepas's territory, as are those seeking to avoid notice.": " Catoblepas作为一种疾病和腐烂的生物，在其沼泽地的栖息地中也呈现出类似的特征。这样的湿地会变得阴暗、纠结，而且比以前更加腥臭。环境的有益品质，如治疗的草药和干净的水，在猫鼬住在附近时就会减少。沼泽的气体有一丝鲶鱼的恶臭。该地区的动物更具攻击性，容易生病。堕落的生物可能会在猫鼬的领地附近居住，那些想要避免被发现的生物也是如此。",
	" Ordinary folk rarely see a catoblepas, but the creature has such a feared reputation that stories about it are ingrained in the popular culture. Any rumor of a catoblepas taking up residence nearby is taken to be a bad omen, even if the rumor is proven false. The silhouette of a catoblepas, with its tail extended over its body and its head held low, is a baleful heraldic figure signifying death or doom.": " 普通人很少看到catoblepas，但这种生物有如此可怕的声誉，以至于关于它的故事在大众文化中根深蒂固。任何关于catoblepas在附近居住的传闻都被认为是一个坏兆头，即使这个传闻被证明是假的。鲶鱼的剪影，尾巴伸在身上，头低着，是一个可怕的预示着死亡或厄运的形象。",
	"A cave fisher is a subterranean arachnid with a long snout that houses spinnerets, enabling the creature to produce sticky filament, much like the strands of a spider's webbing, which the creature uses to snag prey.": "洞穴鱼人是一种地下蛛形纲动物，有一个长长的鼻子，里面有喷丝器，使该生物能够产生粘性的长丝，很像蜘蛛的网线，该生物用它来抓捕猎物。",
	" A cave fisher usually hunts small animals and is fond of bats, so it stretches its filament over an opening that such prey might travel through. It then climbs to a hiding spot and adheres itself to the surface to rest and wait. When prey blunders into the filament, the cave fisher reels in its meal. A group of cave fishers might work together to cover a large area with filaments, but as soon as one captures potential food, every cave fisher in the area competes for the prize. If a victim escapes from the initial ambush, a cave fisher can reclaim its prey by shooting a filament out to capture it again.": " 洞穴捕鱼者通常猎杀小动物，喜欢蝙蝠，所以它把丝线伸到这种猎物可能通过的开口处。然后，它爬到一个隐蔽的地方，把自己贴在表面休息和等待。当猎物误入丝线时，洞穴捕鱼者就会卷起它的食物。一群洞穴捕鱼者可能会一起工作，用丝线覆盖一大片区域，但只要有一只捕到了潜在的食物，该地区的每一只洞穴捕鱼者都会争夺这个奖品。如果一个受害者从最初的埋伏中逃脱，洞穴捕鱼者可以通过射出丝线再次捕获猎物来夺回它。",
	"A cave fisher instinctively knows that larger targets such as humanoids are more difficult to overcome, so the creatures shy away from attacking such prey unless they come across a solitary target. They might try to pick off a scout moving ahead of a group of travelers or a straggler lagging behind, rather than attracting the attention of the entire group.": "洞穴鱼人本能地知道，像人类这样的大型目标更难战胜，因此，除非遇到单独的目标，否则这些生物对攻击这类猎物避之不及。它们可能会试着干掉一个走在一群旅行者前面的侦察员，或者一个落单的人，而不是吸引整个队伍的注意力。",
	" Scarce food might draw a group of cave fishers up to the surface, into a shadowy canyon or a gloomy forest that features both native animal prey and creatures such as explorers or travelers occasionally moving through the area.": " 稀缺的食物可能会吸引一群洞穴捕鱼者上到地面，进入一个阴暗的峡谷或阴暗的森林，其中既有本地动物的猎物，也有探险家或旅行者等生物偶尔经过的地方。",
	" Nearly every part of a cave fisher is useful after the creature has been dispatched. Its blood is alcoholic and tastes like strong liquor. Several dwarven spirits include cave fisher blood as part of the recipe, and some dwarves, especially berserkers, drink the blood straight. If they are gathered after being extruded, cave fisher filaments can be woven into rope that is thin, tough, and nearly invisible. Cave fisher meat is edible, tasting much like crab cooked in strong wine. The creature's shell is used in the manufacture of tools, armor, and jewelry.": " 洞穴鱼人的每一个部分在被打发走后几乎都是有用的。它的血是酒精性的，味道像烈酒。一些矮人酒的配方中包括洞穴鱼人的血，而一些矮人，尤其是狂暴者，则直接饮用这种血。如果在挤压后将其收集起来，洞穴鱼丝可以织成绳子，又细又硬，而且几乎看不见。洞穴鱼人的肉是可以吃的，味道很像用烈酒煮的螃蟹。这种生物的外壳可用于制造工具、盔甲和珠宝。",
	" While some folk hunt cave fishers to kill them for their filaments and their blood, others capture cave fisher eggs and rear the hatchlings. Cave fishers have a natural aversion to fire, since their blood is flammable. As such, chitines and hobgoblins sometimes use the threat of fire to train cave fishers, then employ them to guard passages or as beasts of war.": " 有些人猎杀洞穴鱼是为了得到它们的鱼丝和血液，有些人则捕捉洞穴鱼的卵并饲养孵化出来的小鱼。洞穴鱼对火有一种天然的厌恶，因为它们的血液是可燃的。因此，奇廷人和妖精有时会利用火的威胁来训练洞穴鱼人，然后用它们来守卫通道或作为战争的野兽。",
	"Champions are mighty warriors who honed their fighting skills in wars or gladiatorial pits. To soldiers and other people who fight for a living, champions are as influential as nobles, and their presence is courted as a sign of status among rulers.": "冠军是强大的战士，他们在战争或角斗场中磨练自己的战斗技巧。对于士兵和其他以战斗为生的人来说，冠军和贵族一样有影响力，他们的存在是统治者中地位的象征。",
	"Chitines are multiarmed humanoids with arachnid qualities that serve Lolth. They operate in well-organized colonies that prove to be effective fighters in the war against the enemies of the Demon Queen of Spiders. On occasion, Lolth pits chitines against dark elves-even though both groups worship her-as a way of punishing the drow, who created the chitines but displeased their goddess by doing so.": "Chitines是具有蛛形结构的多臂人形生物，为Lolth服务。他们在组织良好的群体中活动，在对抗蜘蛛魔后的敌人的战争中被证明是有效的战士。有时，洛尔兹会让奇特人与黑暗精灵对抗--尽管这两个群体都崇拜她--作为惩罚乌鸦的一种方式，因为乌鸦创造了奇特人，但这样做使他们的女神不高兴。",
	" Long ago, the drow first subjected elf prisoners to horrible rituals that transformed the captives into creatures with both humanoid and spider traits, which their creators dubbed chitines. The dark elves' intention was to create slaves dedicated first of all to the drow and, by association with them, to Lolth. As the drow ultimately discovered, the goddess found this arrangement unacceptable.": " 很久以前，乌鸦首先对精灵俘虏进行了可怕的仪式，将俘虏转化为既有人类特征又有蜘蛛特征的生物，他们的创造者称之为chitines。黑暗精灵的意图是创造出首先献给乌鸦的奴隶，并且通过与他们的联系，献给洛尔思。正如乌鸦最终发现的那样，女神认为这种安排是不可接受的。",
	"The creation process required cooperation between magical disciplines. Drow wizards and warlocks used arcane magic and demonic powers, and drow priestesses invoked Lolth's aid for the divine spark needed to ensure the subject's survival. Lolth watched, expecting at some part of the process to see these new abominations dedicated to her, but no such ritual was performed. In retribution for this lack of respect, the Spider Queen twisted the drow's creation rituals to serve her own purposes.": "创造过程需要魔法学科之间的合作。鸦人的巫师和术士使用了奥术魔法和恶魔的力量，而鸦人的女祭司则祈求洛尔思的帮助，以获得确保主体生存所需的神性火花。洛尔思看着，期待着在这个过程的某个部分看到这些新的憎恶被献给她，但没有进行这样的仪式。作为对这种缺乏尊重的报复，蜘蛛女王扭曲了乌鸦的创造仪式以达到她自己的目的。",
	"At first, the drow were unaware that the new creatures were signs of Lolth's displeasure with them. Instead, they were pleased, because choldriths could lay eggs that birthed more chitines (and the rare choldrith) and could direct the chitines in their work. But the dark elves came to realize their mistake-choldriths belonged to Lolth, body and soul. They whispered to the chitines of their adoration of the Spider Queen and their enmity of the drow, and the seeds of a rebellion took root and grew. The chitines and choldriths rose up against their would-be masters; soon afterward most of the creatures were free, and a number of the drow who helped breed and tend them were dead.": "起初，乌鸦并不知道这些新生物是洛神对他们不满的标志。相反，他们很高兴，因为choldriths可以产卵，孕育出更多的chitines（和稀有的choldrith），并且可以指导chitines工作。但黑暗精灵意识到他们的错误--Choldriths属于Lolth，身体和灵魂。他们向chitines低声说起他们对蜘蛛女王的崇拜和对乌鸦的敌意，叛乱的种子就这样生根发芽，不断壮大。Chitines和choldriths奋起反抗他们未来的主人；不久之后，大多数生物都获得了自由，一些帮助繁殖和照料它们的乌鸦也死了。",
	"Nowadays, drow still create chitines when they have need to. Outside the presence of a choldrith, chitines make good workers for the drow, and they can be useful if the drow find an independent chitine colony and want to infiltrate it. If the creation process yields a choldrith, though, the drow destroy the creature immediately.": "如今，乌鸦在有需要的时候仍然会创造奇特的人。在choldrith存在的情况下，chitines是乌鸦的好工人，如果乌鸦发现一个独立的chitine群落并想渗透进去，它们就会很有用。不过，如果在创造过程中产生了一个choldrith，乌鸦会立即摧毁这个生物。",
	"As servants of Lolth, choldriths and chitines love spiders and spider-like creatures. They rear spiders and similar arachnids, such as cave fishers. Chitine colonies erect shrines to Lolth that serve as beacons, attracting spiders and other evil, brutish beings that serve her. Anywhere chitines set up a colony quickly becomes a web-shrouded, gloomy, and treacherous place.": "作为Lolth的仆人，Choldriths和Chitines喜欢蜘蛛和类似蜘蛛的生物。他们饲养蜘蛛和类似的蛛形纲动物，如洞穴鱼人。Chitine殖民地为Lolth建立了神龛，作为信标，吸引蜘蛛和其他为她服务的邪恶、野蛮的生物。凡是奇蒂纳人建立殖民地的地方，很快就会成为一个网络笼罩、阴暗和诡谲的地方。",
	"A colony can support numerous choldriths, which serve as commanders, priests, and supervisors. The choldriths continually jockey for position, although they rarely confront one another in a way that puts the colony at risk. The colony is ruled by a singular sovereign that determines which colony members perform which tasks, including whether she or any other choldrith is permitted to lay eggs. If this supreme ruler receives a vision from Lolth, she might change her colony's entire course of action. At such times, chitines have emerged from the Underdark to settle in remote, gloomy places on the surface, from where they can wage war on other species, especially drow and elves.": "一个殖民地可以支持许多choldriths，它们充当指挥官、祭司和监督者。这些人不断地争夺地位，尽管他们很少以使殖民地面临风险的方式相互对抗。殖民地由一个单一的主权者统治，他决定哪些殖民地成员执行哪些任务，包括她或任何其他choldrith是否被允许下蛋。如果这位最高统治者收到来自洛尔思的异象，她可能会改变她的殖民地的整个行动方向。在这种时候，chitines会从地下世界出来，定居在地表偏远、阴暗的地方，在那里它们可以向其他物种发动战争，尤其是乌鸦和精灵。",
	" As the drow continued to perform the rituals, the process usually transformed the subject into the spindly, stunted creature they expected. Occasionally, though, the elf changed into a monstrosity that was more spider than elf, resembling Lolth in her spider form, and more cunning than a chitine, that the drow dubbed a choldrith.": " 随着乌鸦继续进行仪式，这个过程通常会把对象变成他们所期望的那种骨瘦如柴、发育不良的生物。但偶尔，精灵也会变成一个比精灵更像蜘蛛的怪物，类似于蜘蛛形态的洛尔思，比奇丁更狡猾，被乌鸦戏称为choldrith。",
	" Choldriths are born with a fanatical devotion to Lolth, which leads them to develop some skill in divine magic. They preach that chitines are Lolth's favored people, and that choldriths are the Spider Queen's rightful worldly representatives sent to free the chitines from slavery. Although choldriths and chitines lack sexual characteristics, and choldriths need no mate to lay eggs, these creatures choose the gender identity of their goddess. Choldriths also believe and teach that Lolth's spider form, much like that of a choldrith, is her truest shape. Any idol to Lolth in a chitine colony depicts Lolth in this way.": " Choldriths生来就对Lolth有狂热的奉献精神，这使他们发展了一些神圣魔法的技能。他们宣扬chitines是Lolth的宠儿，而choldriths是蜘蛛女王的合法世俗代表，被派来将chitines从奴役中解放出来。虽然choldriths和chitines缺乏性特征，而且choldriths不需要配偶来产卵，但这些生物选择了他们女神的性别身份。Choldriths还相信并教导说，Lolth的蜘蛛形态，很像choldrith的形态，是她最真实的形态。Chitine聚居地中任何供奉Lolth的神像都是以这种方式描绘Lolth。",
	" Chitines and choldriths resemble spiders, but they behave more like social insects such as ants. Chitines are divided into worker and warrior castes, and choldriths occupy the top levels of a colony's hierarchy. Each chitine has a social position that comes with duties related to that rank, and all chitines are expected to willingly sacrifice themselves to protect the choldriths. Every chitine has spinnerets and slowly produces webbing that is used to build floors, walls, structures, objects, and traps that benefit and protect the colony. A warrior might be responsible for crafting web armor (which is as tough as hide or leather), while a group of workers might be tasked to dig a pit trap and cover it with fragile webbing disguised with loose dirt to appear as a solid surface.": " Chitines和choldriths类似于蜘蛛，但它们的行为更像社会性昆虫，如蚂蚁。甲壳虫分为工人种群和战士种群，甲壳虫占据了蚁群等级制度的最高级别。每只甲壳虫都有一个社会地位，伴随着与该等级有关的职责，所有甲壳虫都要自愿牺牲自己来保护甲壳虫。每只奇岩怪都有喷丝头，并慢慢产生网状物，用于建造地板、墙壁、结构、物体和陷阱，以利于保护蚁群。一个战士可能负责制作网状盔甲（它像皮或皮革一样坚硬），而一群工人可能负责挖一个坑道陷阱，并用脆弱的网状物覆盖它，用松散的泥土伪装成坚实的表面。",
	"Cloud giants aren't, on the whole, religious. They tolerate many conflicting ideas about their patron deity, Memnor. The smiling ones strain that tolerance.": "总的来说，云巨人并不信仰宗教。他们容忍许多关于他们的守护神Memnor的矛盾想法。微笑的人使这种宽容变得紧张。",
	"Smiling ones are cloud giants who honor and emulate Memnor's craftiness and deceit above all else. They are tricksters supreme who use sleight of hand, deception, misdirection, and magic in their pursuit of wealth. They also possess a flair for unpredictability and a wicked sense of humor.": "笑面人是云中巨人，他们尊崇并效仿梅姆诺的狡猾和欺骗，胜过一切。他们是诡计多端的人，在追求财富的过程中使用技巧、欺骗、误导和魔法。他们还拥有不可预知的天赋和邪恶的幽默感。",
	"While cloud giants expect a certain amount of trickery and deceit in their dealings with others of their kind, smiling ones overstep the bounds of decorum with their behavior, doing and saying things that nobler cloud giants consider beneath the dignity of their kind.": "虽然云巨人在与其他同类打交道时希望有一定程度的诡计和欺骗，但微笑的人在行为上超越了礼仪的界限，做的和说的都是更高贵的云巨人认为有损其尊严的事情。",
	" Smiling ones take their name from the strange two-faced masks they wear. The smiling half of the face often looks more like a smirk or a triumphant sneer than a pleasant grin. The frowning half represents the displeasure smiling ones feel about their place in the ordning-second to the storm giants. The masks serve as symbols of their devotion, but they also conceal their wearers' true facial expressions.": " 笑面人的名字来自他们所戴的奇怪的双面面具。笑着的那半张脸往往看起来更像是傻笑或胜利的冷笑，而不是愉快的笑容。皱着眉头的那半张脸代表着微笑者对他们在秩序中的地位感到不快，他们的地位仅次于风暴巨头。面具是他们奉献精神的象征，但它们也掩盖了佩戴者的真实面部表情。",
	"Conjurers are specialist wizards who summon creatures from other planes and create materials out of thin air. Some conjurers use their magic to bolster armies or destroy enemies on battlefields, while others use summoned creatures to guard their lairs.": "魔法师是专业的魔法师，他们从其他星球召唤生物，并凭空创造材料。一些魔法师用他们的魔法来支持军队或在战场上消灭敌人，而另一些则用召唤的生物来守护他们的巢穴。",

	"Mind flayers create cranium rats by bombarding normal rats with psionic energy.": "噬心者通过用幻觉能量轰击正常的老鼠来制造颅骨老鼠。",
	"Cranium rats are no smarter than ordinary rats and behave as such. However, if enough cranium rats come together to form a swarm, they merge their minds into a single intelligence with the accumulated memories of all the swarm's constituents. The rats become smarter as a result, and they retain their heightened intelligence for as long as the swarm persists. The swarm also awakens latent psionic abilities implanted within each cranium rat by its mind flayer creators, bestowing upon the swarm psionic powers similar to spells.": "颅鼠并不比普通老鼠聪明，其行为也是如此。然而，如果有足够多的颅骨鼠聚集在一起形成一个鼠群，它们就会将自己的头脑与鼠群中所有成员的累积记忆融合成一个单一的智能。老鼠因此而变得更加聪明，而且只要鼠群持续存在，它们就能保持其高度的智能。鼠群还唤醒了由它的弑心者植入每只颅骨鼠体内的潜在幻觉能力，赋予鼠群类似于法术的幻觉能力。",
	"A rat separated from the swarm becomes an ordinary cranium rat with an Intelligence of 15. It loses 1 point of Intelligence each day that it remains separated from the swarm. Its Intelligence can't drop below 4 and becomes 15 again if it rejoins the swarm or another one.": "从鼠群中分离出来的老鼠成为一只普通的颅鼠，智力为15。它与鼠群分离的每一天都会损失1点智力。它的智力不能低于4，如果它重新加入虫群或另一个虫群，它的智力会再次变成15。",

	"Ancient legends speak of a seelie fey who betrayed the Summer Queen. His true name has been stricken from history, but the stories call him Dubh Catha (\"Dark Crow\" in Common). So great was the Summer Queen's wrath that she cursed every member of his house. Other fey refer to the descendants of Dubh Catha's house as the dubh sith-or, in Common, \"darklings.\" Darklings most often settle in secluded caverns and chambers beneath the towns of other species. From such enclaves, they quietly ply their trade as thieves and assassins.": "古老的传说中，有一个背叛了夏日女王的塞利族人。他的真名已经从历史中抹去，但故事中称他为Dubh Catha（\"黑暗乌鸦 \"的俗称）。夏日女王的愤怒是如此之大，以至于她诅咒了他家的每一个成员。其他费伊人将杜伯-卡塔家族的后裔称为杜伯-西特--或者用普通话说，\"黑灵\"。黑暗人最常定居在其他物种的城镇下的隐蔽洞穴和房间里。在这样的飞地里，他们悄悄地做着小偷和刺客的生意。",
	" The Summer Queen's curse causes a darkling's body to absorb light, and doing so wizens the creature, much like the effect of rapid aging. For this reason, darklings cover every part of their body with clothing when exposure to light is a risk. The light a darkling absorbs over the course of its lifetime explodes outward when the darkling dies, incinerating the creature and much of its possessions.": " 夏日女王的诅咒使黑灵的身体吸收光线，这样做会使生物变聪明，就像快速老化的效果一样。出于这个原因，当暴露在光线下有风险时，黑暗生物会用衣服遮盖身体的每一部分。黑暗生物在其一生中吸收的光线在黑暗生物死亡时向外爆发，焚烧生物和其大部分财产。",
	" Despite their curse, darklings retain a fondness for the beauty of art. A darkling might risk taking a peek at a sunset or lighting a tiny candle to glimpse the colors in a painting or a jewel.": " 尽管他们受到诅咒，黑暗人仍然对艺术之美情有独钟。黑暗人可能会冒险偷看日落，或点燃一支小蜡烛，以瞥见绘画或珠宝中的色彩。",
	" A wise and respected darkling can qualify to undergo a ritual to become an elder. Other elders mark the supplicant with glowing tattoos, channeling some of the darkling's absorbed light away from its body. If the ritual succeeds, the darkling grows into a tall and fair form, like that of a gray-skinned elf. The darkling perishes if the ritual fails.": " 一个聪明的、受人尊敬的黑暗精灵可以有资格接受一个仪式，成为长老。其他长老会在祈求者身上打上发光的纹身，将暗灵吸收的一些光线从它的身体上引走。如果仪式成功，黑灵会成长为一个高大而白皙的形态，就像灰皮肤的精灵一样。如果仪式失败，黑灵就会灭亡。",
	"A death kiss is a lesser beholder that might come into being when a beholder has a vivid nightmare about losing blood. Instead of magical eye rays, it has ten long tentacles, each ending in a mouth full of teeth. In coloration and shape it is similar to the beholder that dreamed it into existence, but its hue is more muted.": "死亡之吻是一种较小的待人接物，当待人接物者做了一个关于失血的生动的噩梦时可能会出现。它没有神奇的眼线，而是有十条长长的触角，每条触角的末端都有一张长满牙齿的嘴。在颜色和形状上，它与梦到它存在的观世音相似，但它的色调更加柔和。",
	" A death kiss survives solely on ingested blood, which it uses to generate electrical energy inside its body. Paranoid about dying from starvation, it obsessively drains even little creatures such as rats in an effort to stave off this fate for as long as possible. After it drains its prey, it abandons the corpse to scavengers. A death kiss prefers to hunt alone. If it meets another death kiss, it might fight, flee, or team up, depending on its health and pride. When underground, it uses its tentacles as feelers, prodding and examining the environment in all directions. Above ground, it usually keeps its tentacles retracted when on the hunt, then lashes out and extends them to their full length to catch opponents off guard.": " 死亡之吻只靠摄取血液生存，它用血液在体内产生电能。它偏执地认为自己会死于饥饿，所以它甚至痴迷于吸食小动物，如老鼠，以尽可能长时间地避免这种命运。当它吸干猎物的血后，它就把尸体丢给食腐动物。死亡之吻喜欢单独狩猎。如果它遇到另一只死亡之吻，它可能会战斗、逃跑或联手，这取决于它的健康和自尊。在地下时，它用触角作为感觉器，探查和检查各个方向的环境。在地面上，它通常在捕猎时保持触手缩回，然后猛然伸出触手，让对手猝不及防。",
	" In poor lighting and with its tentacles extended, a death kiss can be mistaken for a true beholder. It might purposely present itself as a beholder to an ignorant creature, but this behavior is rare, since it usually is focused on hunting and lacks the self-importance and paranoia of a true beholder. It can speak through any of its tentacle-throats, and its voice sounds nasal and high-pitched. A true beholder has little to fear from a death kiss, since it can easily kill or subdue the death kiss long before the death kiss gets into melee range. Thus, out of self-preservation, a death kiss usually submits to the rule of a beholder that it encounters, though it might attempt to escape as soon as its master is preoccupied.": " 在光线不好的情况下，当它的触手伸出来时，死亡之吻可能会被误认为是一个真正的beholder。它可能会故意把自己当成一个无知的生物，但这种行为是罕见的，因为它通常专注于狩猎，缺乏真正的生物的自负和偏执。它可以通过它的任何一个触手喉说话，其声音听起来是鼻音和高音。真正的看守者对死亡之吻没有什么好怕的，因为在死亡之吻进入近战范围之前，它就可以轻易地杀死或制服死亡之吻。因此，出于自我保护的考虑，死亡之吻通常会服从它所遇到的看守者的统治，尽管它可能会在它的主人心事重重时试图逃跑。",
	" A death kiss lacks the combat finesse and intelligence of a beholder. It might attempt an unusual maneuver to control its prey (such as flying up while grappling), but in most cases, it attaches one or more of its tentacles to a creature and drains blood until its prey collapses. If it is in a superior position and its opponent poses no threat, it might toy with its food, slowly squeezing and draining the life out of a creature.": " 死亡之吻缺乏战斗的技巧和智慧。它可能会尝试不寻常的动作来控制它的猎物（比如在抓捕时飞起来），但在大多数情况下，它把它的一条或多条触手附在一个生物上，吸干血液，直到它的猎物倒下。如果它处于优势地位，而且对手不构成威胁，它可能会玩弄它的食物，慢慢地挤压和吸干一个生物的生命。",
	"Deep scions began life as people who were stolen from shore or saved from sinking ships and offered a terrible bargain by an undersea power: surrender, body and soul, or drown. Those who submit are subjected to an ancient ritual widespread among evil aquatic creatures. Its methods are painful and the result never certain, but when it works, the magic transforms an air-breathing person into a shapechanger that can take a form that is fully at home beneath the waves.": "深海后裔的生活开始于那些从岸上被盗或从沉船中被救的人，他们被一种海底力量提供了一个可怕的交易：投降，身体和灵魂，或者淹死。那些投降的人要接受一种在邪恶的水生生物中广泛存在的古老仪式。其方法是痛苦的，结果也不确定，但当它起作用时，这个魔法将一个呼吸空气的人变成一个变形人，可以采取完全在海下的形式。",
	" A deep scion emerges from the depths in service to its underwater master, which is likely a kraken or some other ancient being of the deep. While wearing the mind and body of the person it once was as a sort of mask, the creature is bent on fulfilling its master's desires. Sometimes a deep scion returns to its former home and a hero's welcome-unexpectedly found alive when all hope was lost. At other times the deep scion takes on a new identity. In any case, it is the deep scion's duty to infiltrate the air-breathing world and report back to its master. When set to its task, a deep scion worms its way into the life of an unsuspecting enemy as a new best friend, an irresistible lover, the perfect candidate for a job, or in some other role that enables the minion to carry out its master's commands.": " 一个深海子孙从深海中出现，为它的水下主人服务，这个主人很可能是克拉肯或其他深海中的古老生物。在戴着曾经的身心作为一种面具的同时，这种生物一心想要满足其主人的欲望。有时，深渊子孙回到它以前的家，受到英雄的欢迎--在所有希望都破灭的时候，意外地发现它还活着。在其他时候，深渊子孙会有一个新的身份。在任何情况下，潜入呼吸空气的世界并向其主人报告是深渊子孙的职责。当被安排执行任务时，深层子孙会以新的最好的朋友、不可抗拒的情人、工作的最佳人选，或以其他角色进入毫无戒心的敌人的生活，使其能够执行其主人的命令。",
	"If you meet a human and there's something fishy about them, they might be a deep scion. Or a crook, or just a fishmonger. Sometimes fish stink is just fish stink.": "如果你遇到一个人类，而他们身上有一些腥味，他们可能是一个深藏不露的子孙。或者是一个骗子，或者只是一个鱼贩子。有时鱼腥味就是鱼腥味。",
	" The training to which a deep scion is subjected rids it of empathy for those whom it spies on. Though one might behave as though infatuated, laugh at the joke of a friend, or appear incensed at some injustice, each of these acts is artificial to the deep scion, a means to an end. It believes that its true form is the shape it takes when it returns to the sea that it thinks of as home. Ironically, however, a deep scion that is killed when in its piscine form is stripped of the magic that robbed it of emotion, leaving behind the corpse of the person the deep scion once was.": " 深层子弟所受的训练使它对它所监视的人失去了同情心。虽然一个人可能表现得很迷恋，对朋友的笑话大笑，或对某些不公正的事情表现得很愤怒，但这些行为对深海鱼来说都是人为的，是达到目的的一种手段。它相信，它的真实形态是它回到它认为是家的大海时的形态。然而，具有讽刺意味的是，当深海龙卷风被杀时，它被剥夺了夺走其情感的魔法，留下的是深海龙卷风曾经的尸体。",

	" A lesser demon that proves itself to Orcus might be granted the privilege of becoming a devourer. The Prince of Undeath transforms such a demon into an 8-foot-tall, desiccated humanoid with a hollowed-out ribcage, then fills the new creature with a hunger for souls. Orcus grants each new devourer the essence of a less fortunate demon to power the devourer's first foray into the planes. Most devourers remain in the Abyss, or on the Astral or Ethereal Plane, pursuing Orcus's schemes and interests in those realms. When Orcus sends devourers to the Material Plane, he often sets them on a mission to create, control, and lead a plague of undead. Skeletons, zombies, ghouls and ghasts, and shadows are particularly attracted to the presence of a devourer.": " 一个较小的恶魔如果向奥库斯证明了自己，可能会被授予成为吞噬者的特权。不死鸟王子将这样的恶魔变成一个8英尺高，肋骨被挖空的干瘪人形，然后用对灵魂的饥渴来填满这个新生物。奥库斯授予每个新的吞噬者一个不太幸运的恶魔的精髓，为吞噬者首次进入各星球提供动力。大多数吞噬者留在深渊、星界或虚空界，追寻奥库斯在这些领域的计划和利益。当奥库斯将吞噬者派往物质界时，他通常会让他们执行一项任务，创造、控制并领导一场亡灵瘟疫。骷髅、僵尸、食尸鬼和野兽，以及阴影都会被吞噬者的存在所吸引。",
	"I've heard of \"rib-sticking,\" but this is ridiculous.": "我听说过 \"插肋\"，但这太荒谬了。",
	" Devourers hunt humanoids, with the intent of consuming them body and soul. After a devourer brings a target to the brink of death, it pulls the victim's body in and traps the creature within its own ribcage. As the victim tries to stave off death (usually without success), the devourer tortures its soul with telepathic noise. When the victim expires, it undergoes a horrible transformation, springing forth from the devourer's body to begin its new existence as an undead servitor of the monster that spawned it.": " 吞噬者猎杀人类，目的是吞噬他们的身体和灵魂。在吞噬者将目标带到死亡边缘后，它将受害者的身体拉过来，将生物困在自己的肋骨里。当受害者试图阻止死亡时（通常不成功），吞噬者用心灵感应的噪音折磨其灵魂。当受害者死亡时，它经历了一个可怕的转变，从吞噬者的身体里跳出来，作为产生它的怪物的不死仆从开始它的新生活。",
	" A devourer doesn't require air, food (other than souls), drink, or sleep.": " 吞噬者不需要空气、食物（除灵魂外）、饮料或睡眠。",

	"A draegloth is an ogre-sized, four-armed humanoid with purple-black skin and yellow-white hair. Two of its arms are huge and muscular, tipped with sharp claws; the other two are the size and shape of drow arms, capable of delicate movements. Although the creature is heavily muscled, it is graceful and quiet like a drow. Its face is clearly demonic, with bestial features, glowing red eyes, an elongated dog-like snout, and a mouth full of sharp teeth.": "德雷格拉斯是一种食人魔大小的四臂人形生物，拥有紫黑色的皮肤和黄白色的头发。它的两只手臂巨大且肌肉发达，顶端有锋利的爪子；另外两只手臂的大小和形状与乌鸦的手臂一样，能够进行精细的运动。虽然这个生物肌肉发达，但它却像一个乌鸦一样优雅而安静。它的脸明显是恶魔化的，有兽性的特征，发光的红眼睛，拉长的狗一样的鼻子，和满嘴的尖牙。",
	" The ritual to create a draegloth succeeds only rarely, but when it does, it is a great event that is seen by the drow of the house as a sign of the demon lord Lolth's favor-and a sign of Lolth's disregard for the family's rivals, which were not thus gifted. The birth prompts the leaders of the house to begin crafting new plans to strike at its rivals when the draegloth is fully grown. These plans always use the draegloth in a significant role, because its abilities can turn the tide in a battle against a house that doesn't have a draegloth of its own.": " 创造draegloth的仪式很少成功，但一旦成功，这就是一个伟大的事件，被该家族的乌鸦视为恶魔领主Lolth青睐的标志--也是Lolth无视该家族对手的标志，因为他们并没有这样的天赋。这个孩子的出生促使该家族的领导人开始制定新的计划，以便在德雷格拉斯完全长大后对其竞争对手进行打击。这些计划总是以德雷格拉斯为重要角色，因为它的能力可以在与没有自己的德雷格拉斯的家族的战斗中扭转局势。",

	" Although it plays an important part in the welfare of its house, a draegloth can't rise above the status of a favored slave or a consort to a priestess. Before a draegloth is given any duties, it receives instruction in accepting the role set for it and not challenging authority. Draegloths instinctively resist this sort of treatment, but most of them take out their frustration on their house's enemies. A draegloth that can't suppress its ambitions might abandon its house and strike out on its own. Whether these rebellious draegloths are part of Lolth's plan for sowing even greater chaos is unclear.": " 虽然它在其家族的福利中扮演着重要的角色，但draegloth不能超越受宠的奴隶或女祭司的妃子的地位。在Draegloth被赋予任何职责之前，它接受指导，接受为它设定的角色，不挑战权威。Draegloths本能地抵制这种待遇，但他们中的大多数人将他们的挫折感发泄在他们家族的敌人身上。一个无法压制其野心的德雷格罗特人可能会放弃自己的家族，独自出击。这些反叛的德雷格拉斯是否是洛尔兹播种更大混乱计划的一部分，目前还不清楚。",
	" A draegloth loves the feeling of tearing opponents apart with its claws and teeth and of wielding the magic that courses through its veins.

Through excavation and mining in the area, they fashion living space and obtain an ample supply of minerals for other uses, such as smelting, smithing, and alchemy. A firenewt lair features a network of channels and sluices to circulate hot liquid through the settlement.": "Firenewts在地球上寻找热源，如沸腾的泥浆和温泉，这些地方是理想的定居地。通过在该地区的挖掘和开采，它们形成了生活空间，并获得了充足的矿物供应，用于其他用途，如熔炼、铁匠和炼金术。一个火牛巢穴的特点是有一个渠道和水闸网络，以使热液在定居点内循环。",
	"The alchemy practiced by firenewts focuses on fire. One of their favorite mixtures is a paste of sulfur, mineral salts, and oil. Firenewts chew this blend habitually, because doing so produces a pleasant internal heat and it enables a firenewt to vomit forth a small ball of flame. Most firenewts carry a container with this mixture in it.": "Firenewts所练习的炼金术以火为重点。他们最喜欢的混合物之一是硫磺、矿物盐和油的混合物。火牛习惯性地咀嚼这种混合物，因为这样做会产生一种令人愉快的内部热量，并使火牛能够吐出一个小火球。大多数火纽特携带一个装有这种混合物的容器。",
	"Warlocks of Imix command warriors to prove their worth by going on raids to bring back treasure and captives. The warlocks take the choicest loot as a tithe to Imix, and then those who participated in the raid divide the rest according to merit. Prisoners that have no apparent usefulness are sacrificed to Imix and then eaten. Those that are deemed capable of mining and performing other chores around the lair are kept as slaves for a while before meeting the same fate.": "Imix的术士们指挥战士们通过突袭带回财宝和俘虏来证明自己的价值。术士们把最精挑细选的战利品作为对伊米克斯的奉献，然后那些参与突袭的人根据功绩分配其余的东西。没有明显用处的俘虏被献给伊米克斯，然后被吃掉。那些被认为有能力在巢穴周围采矿和做其他杂务的人，在遭遇同样的命运之前，会被作为奴隶保存一段时间。",
	"When firenewts muster for war, rather than merely staging occasional raids, they take no prisoners. Their goal is nothing less than the annihilation of their foes—and they reserve their greatest animosity for others of their kind. If two groups of firenewts come upon each other, it's likely that they're in competition for the same territory, and a bloody battle is the usual result.": "当火羚羊为战争而集结时，而不仅仅是偶尔的突袭，它们不留活口。它们的目标是消灭它们的敌人--它们对其他同类保留最大的敌意。如果两群火蚁相遇，它们很可能是为了争夺同一块领土，而一场血腥的战斗是通常的结果。",
	" Firenewt society and culture are based on the worship of Imix, the Prince of Evil Fire. This veneration of Imix leads firenewts to be aggressive, wrathful, and cruel. Firenewt warlocks of Imix teach that by demonstrating these qualities, a firenewt warrior in combat can become \"touched by the Fire Lord,\" entering a nearly unstoppable battle rage.": " 火牛的社会和文化是建立在对邪火王子Imix的崇拜上的。这种对伊米克斯的崇拜导致火牛人具有攻击性、愤怒和残忍的性格。崇拜伊米克斯的火牛术士教导说，通过展示这些品质，火牛战士在战斗中可以成为 \"被火神感动 \"的人，进入一种几乎不可阻挡的战斗怒火。",
	" Firenewts have a close relationship with a type of monstrous beast they believe Imix sent to aid them-borne out by the creatures' ability to send a gout of flame against distant enemies. Called giant striders, these monsters appear birdlike and reptilian, but are truly neither. Firenewts provide shelter, food, and breeding grounds in their lairs for giant striders, and the striders voluntarily serve as mounts for elite fire newt soldiers.": " 火蝾螈与一种怪兽有着密切的关系，他们认为是伊米克斯派来帮助他们的--这种怪兽有能力对远方的敌人喷射出火焰。这些怪物被称为巨大的黾，看起来像鸟类和爬行动物，但实际上都不是。火蝾螈在它们的巢穴中为巨黾提供住所、食物和繁殖地，而巨黾则自愿充当精英火蝾螈士兵的坐骑。",

	" Left undisturbed, a flail snail moves slowly along the ground, consuming everything on the surface, including rocks, sand, and soil, stopping to relish crystal growths and other large mineral deposits. It leaves behind a shimmering trail that quickly solidifies into a thin layer of a nearly transparent substance inedible to the snail. This glassy residue can be harvested and cut to form window panes of varying clearness. It can also be heated and spun into glass objects of other sorts. Some humanoids make a living from trailing flail snails to collect this glass.": " 如果不受干扰，蜗牛会沿着地面缓慢移动，吞噬地面上的一切，包括岩石、沙子和土壤，停下来津津乐道于晶体的生长和其他大型矿物的沉积。它留下了一个闪闪发光的痕迹，很快就凝固成一层薄薄的近乎透明的物质，对蜗牛来说是不可食用的。这种玻璃状的残留物可以被收割并切割成不同透明度的窗玻璃。它还可以被加热并旋转成其他种类的玻璃制品。一些人类以拖曳扇形蜗牛来收集这种玻璃为生。",

	" Every few years, a froghemoth can lay a fertile egg without mating. The froghemoth cares nothing for its egg, and might eat the hatchling. A young froghemoth's survival is most often predicated on its parent leaving it behind in indifference. A newborn froghemoth grows to full size over a period of months by indiscriminately preying on other creatures in its swampy domain. It learns to hide its enormous body in murky pools, keeping only its eyestalk above water to watch for passing creatures. When food comes within reach, the froghemoth erupts from its pool, tentacles and tongue flailing. It can grab several targets at once, keeping them at bay while it wraps its tongue around another one and pulls it in to be devoured.": " 每隔几年，一只蛙人可以在不交配的情况下产下一个可育的卵。蛙hemoth对它的蛋毫不关心，可能会吃掉孵化的孩子。一个年轻的青蛙hemoth的生存，最常见的前提是它的父母冷漠地留下它。一个新生的蛙人在几个月的时间里，通过不分青红皂白地捕食其沼泽地里的其他生物，成长为全尺寸。它学会了把自己巨大的身体藏在阴暗的池塘里，只把眼柄放在水面上观察过往的生物。当食物触手可及时，青蛙巨兽就会从池子里爆发出来，触手和舌头乱舞。它可以同时抓住几个目标，让它们处于危险之中，同时用舌头缠住另一个目标，把它拉过来吞噬。",
	" If a bullywug tribe comes across a froghemoth, the bullywugs treat the froghemoth as a god and do all they can to coax the monster into their den. A froghemoth can be tamed (after a fashion) by offering it food, and bullywugs can communicate with it on a basic level, so the creature might eat only a few bullywugs before following the rest. Bullywugs gather food as tribute for it, provide it with a comfortable lair, fanatically protect it from harm, and try to ensure that any young froghemoth reaches maturity.": " 如果一个恶霸部落遇到了一只青蛙巨兽，恶霸们会把青蛙巨兽当作神，并尽其所能把怪物哄骗到他们的巢穴里。蛙人可以通过提供食物来驯服它（在某种程度上），而且恶霸蛙可以与它进行基本的交流，所以这个怪物可能只吃几个恶霸蛙，然后再跟着其他的恶霸蛙。恶霸收集食物作为对它的贡品，为它提供一个舒适的巢穴，狂热地保护它免受伤害，并试图确保任何年轻的蛙人达到成熟。",
	"To hold its place or rise within the ordning, a frost giant must routinely face mighty foes in single combat. Some seek out magic that will aid them, but enchanted objects can be taken or lost. True greatness relies on personal prowess. Faced with this truth, a frost giant might seek a supernatural gift from Vaprak the Destroyer.": "为了保持自己的地位或在军团中崛起，冰霜巨人必须经常在单兵作战中面对强大的敌人。有些人寻找可以帮助他们的魔法，但被施了魔法的东西可能会被拿走或丢失。真正的伟大要靠个人的能力。面对这一事实，冰霜巨人可能会从毁灭者瓦普拉克那里寻求一份超自然的礼物。",
	" Frost giants mainly turn to Vaprak, a rapacious god of strength and hunger worshiped by ogres and trolls, out of desperation. Vaprak likes to tempt frost giants with dreams of glory followed by nightmares of bloody cannibalism. Those who don't shrink from such visions or report them to priests of Thrym receive more of the same. If a frost giant comes to relish these dreams and nightmares, as some do, Vaprak sets a troll upon a sacred quest to find the frost giant and meet it in secret. The troll offers up its own body to be devoured in Vaprak's name. Only the boldest and most determined frost giants can finish such a gory feast.": " 冰霜巨人主要是出于绝望而求助于瓦普拉克，他是食人魔和巨魔所崇拜的贪婪的力量和饥饿之神。瓦普拉克喜欢用荣耀的梦想来诱惑冰霜巨人，然后是血腥的吃人恶梦。那些不畏惧这种幻觉或向泰瑞姆的祭司报告的人，会得到更多相同的东西。如果一个冰霜巨人像某些人一样喜欢这些梦境和噩梦，瓦普拉克就会让一个巨魔执行神圣的任务，去寻找冰霜巨人并与之秘密会面。巨魔献出自己的身体，以瓦普拉克的名义被吞噬。只有最勇敢、最坚定的冰霜巨人才能完成这样一场血淋淋的盛宴。",
	" After devouring the troll sent by Vaprak, bones and all, a frost giant becomes an everlasting one, gaining tremendous strength, an ill temper, and a troll's regenerative ability. With these gifts, the frost giant can swiftly claim the title of jarl and easily fend off rivals for decades. However, if the frost giant doesn't give enough honor to Vaprak or fails to heed Vaprak's visions, injuries the frost giant sustains heal wrong, often resulting in discolored skin, warty scars, and vestigial body parts, such as extra digits, limbs, and even extra heads. The touch of Vaprak can no longer be hidden then, and the everlasting one is either killed or exiled by its clan. Sometimes small communities of everlasting ones gather and even reproduce, passing the \"blessing\" and worship of Vaprak from one generation to the next.": " 在吞噬了瓦普拉克派来的巨魔，包括骨头和所有的东西之后，冰霜巨人成为了一个永恒的巨人，获得了巨大的力量、坏脾气和巨魔的再生能力。有了这些天赋，冰霜巨人可以迅速获得伯爵的头衔，并在几十年内轻松抵御对手。然而，如果冰霜巨人没有给瓦普拉克足够的荣誉，或者没有听从瓦普拉克的预言，那么冰霜巨人受到的伤害就会错误地愈合，往往会导致皮肤变色、疣状疤痕和身体残余部分，如额外的数字、肢体，甚至额外的头。这时，Vaprak的触觉就无法再被掩盖了，永生者要么被杀死，要么被其部族流放。有时，小规模的永生者聚集在一起，甚至繁殖，将 \"祝福 \"和对Vaprak的崇拜从一代传到另一代。",
	"A gauth is a hungry, tyrannical beholder-like creature that eats magic and tries to exact tribute from anything weaker than itself.

It has color and texture variations similar to a true beholder.": "高斯是一种饥饿的、暴虐的、类似于beholder的生物，它吃魔法，并试图从任何比自己弱的东西身上索取贡品。它的身体直径约为4英尺，有六根眼梗，一只中央的眼睛（有时被多只小眼睛包围），嘴边有四只小的抓取触手。它的颜色和纹理变化类似于真正的beholder。",
	" A gauth can survive on meat but prefers to sustain itself with power drained from magic objects. If starved of magic for several weeks, it is forced back to its home plane, so it constantly seeks new items to drain. A gauth might employ creatures to serve it by bringing it items that provide it with sustenance.": " 高斯可以靠吃肉生存，但它更喜欢用从魔法物品中吸取的能量来维持自己的生命。如果连续几周没有魔法，它就会被迫回到自己的母体，所以它不断地寻找新的物品来消耗。高斯可能会雇佣一些生物来为它服务，给它带来一些物品，为它提供养料。",
	" When the ritual to summon a spectator goes wrong, a gauth might push itself through the flawed connection, arriving immediately or several minutes later. It might present itself as a beholder to ignorant creatures in an attempt to intimidate them, or as a spectator to its summoner in order to drain magic items it is expected to guard.": " 当召唤旁观者的仪式出错时，一个高斯可能会通过有缺陷的连接推动自己，立即到达或几分钟后到达。它可能向无知的生物展示自己，试图恐吓他们，或者向召唤者展示自己，以消耗它要守护的魔法物品。",
	" A beholder usually drives away or kills any gauths that enter its territory, but it might choose to enslave them and use them as lieutenants. Gauths are less xenophobic than beholders, so they might form small clusters and work together, though they're just as likely to ignore each other entirely.": " 看守者通常会赶走或杀死任何进入其领地的高斯，但它也可能选择奴役它们，把它们当作副手。高斯的排外性比beholder低，所以他们可能会形成小型集群并一起工作，不过他们也有可能完全不理会对方。",
	"A gazer is a tiny manifestation of a beholder's dreams. It resembles the beholder who dreamed it into existence, but its body is only 8 inches wide, and it has only four eyestalks. It follows its creator like a devoted, aggressive puppy, and sometimes small packs of these creatures patrol their master's lair for vermin to kill and lone creatures to harass.": "凝视者是观察者的梦想的微小表现。它与梦到它的人很相似，但它的身体只有8英寸宽，而且只有四根眼梗。它像一只忠实的、好斗的小狗一样跟随它的创造者，有时这些生物的小群会在它们主人的巢穴里巡逻，寻找可以杀死的害虫和可以骚扰的孤独生物。",
	" A gazer can't speak any languages but can approximate mimicking words and sentences in a high-pitched, mocking manner. Beholders find gazers amusing and tolerate their presence like spoiled pets. A gazer can't be tamed by anyone but its creator, except through the use of magic or by bonding with a spellcaster (see sidebar). Some beholders with wizard minions insist they take a gazer as a familiar because they can see through the eyes of these creatures.": " 凝视者不能说任何语言，但能以高亢、嘲弄的方式近似地模仿单词和句子。凝视者认为凝视者很有趣，并像被宠坏的宠物一样容忍他们的存在。除了它的创造者，任何人都无法驯服凝视者，除非通过使用魔法或与施法者结合（见侧边栏）。一些拥有巫师爪牙的持咒者坚持认为他们把凝视者当作熟悉的人，因为他们可以通过这些生物的眼睛看东西。",
	" A wild gazer (one living separately from a beholder) is territorial, eats bugs and small animals, and is known for playing with its food. A lone gazer avoids picking fights with creatures that are Medium or larger, but a pack of them might take on larger prey. A gazer might follow humanoids in its territory, noisily mimicking their speech and generally being a nuisance, until they leave the area, but it flees if confronted by something it can't kill.": " 野生的凝视者（与注视者分开生活的凝视者）具有领地性，吃虫子和小动物，并以玩弄食物而闻名。孤独的凝视者会避免与中等或更大的生物发生争斗，但一群凝视者可能会对付更大的猎物。凝视者可能会在其领地内跟踪人类，嘈杂地模仿他们的语言，一般来说是个讨厌鬼，直到他们离开该地区，但如果遇到它无法杀死的东西，它就会逃离。",
	"Spellcasters who are interested in unusual familiars find that gazers are eager to serve someone who has magical power, especially those who make a point of bullying and harassing others. The gazer behaves aggressively toward creatures smaller than itself, and it tends to randomly attack house pets, farm animals, and even children in town unless its master is very strict. A gazer serving as a familiar has the following trait.": "对不寻常的家族动物感兴趣的施法者发现，凝视者渴望为拥有魔法力量的人服务，尤其是那些以欺负和骚扰他人为目的的人。凝视者对比自己小的生物表现得很有攻击性，它往往会随意攻击家里的宠物、农场动物，甚至是镇上的孩子，除非它的主人非常严格。作为熟人的凝视者具有以下特征。",
	" The gazer can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing master, provided that the master is at least a 3rd-level spellcaster. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the gazer senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. If its master causes it physical harm, the gazer will end its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond.": " 凝视者可以把另一个生物当作熟悉的人，与它愿意的主人形成心灵感应的联系，前提是主人至少是一个3级的施法者。当两者结合时，只要它们在彼此1英里的范围内，主人就能感觉到凝视者的感觉。如果它的主人对它造成了身体上的伤害，凝视者将结束它作为熟悉者的服务，打破心灵感应的联系。",
	"A girallon looks like an oversized, four-armed ape with gray skin and white fur. Its fangs and claws set it apart from a normal ape, revealing it to be a monstrous predator.": "吉拉龙看起来像一个超大的四臂猿，有灰色的皮肤和白色的毛发。它的獠牙和爪子使它有别于普通的猿猴，显示出它是一种可怕的捕食者。",
	" Girallons are most common in temperate or warm forest environments abundant with life. They share the ape's adeptness at climbing, although these half-ton creatures shy away from scaling trees that can't support their bulk. Instead, they stalk the forest floor, lurk in narrow ravines or shallow caves, or hide in ruined sites while waiting for prey to come near. A girallon is surprisingly stealthy, considering its size and its lack of camouflage.": " 长颈鹿在温带或温暖的森林环境中最常见，那里有丰富的生物。它们与猿猴一样善于攀爬，尽管这些半吨重的生物羞于攀爬无法支撑其体型的树木。相反，它们在森林地面上潜行，潜伏在狭窄的峡谷或浅水洞中，或躲在废墟中等待猎物的到来。考虑到其体型和缺乏伪装，吉拉龙的隐蔽性令人惊讶。",
	"Girallons form loose bands of several individuals and their offspring, usually led by a dominant adult that also tends to be the oldest member of the group. When on the hunt away from their lair, girallons use roars and body language to communicate with one another over distance. Each individual typically hunts alone and widely separated from the others, to ensure that everyone gets adequate fodder. The leader might organize members to work together to make a big kill. If they succeed, everyone in the group shares the spoils, with the best parts going to mothers caring for their young.": "长颈鹿由几个个体和它们的后代组成松散的群体，通常由一个占主导地位的成年人领导，他也往往是群体中最老的成员。当在远离巢穴的地方狩猎时，长颈鹿使用吼叫和肢体语言进行远距离交流。每个个体通常单独狩猎，并与其他个体分开，以确保每个人都得到足够的饲料。领导者可能会组织成员一起合作，进行一次大屠杀。如果他们成功了，群体中的每个人都会分享战利品，最好的部分会给照顾孩子的母亲。",
	"In the time since then, numerous creatures have tried to tame, subjugate, or cooperate with the monsters. For instance, yuan-ti enslave girallons, turning them into border sentinels for their serpent kingdoms. Because girallons are known to be peaceful among their own kind, some humanoids have learned how to approach a group's leader, offering food and other gifts in hopes of establishing an alliance with the creatures.": "在此后的时间里，许多生物都试图驯服、征服或与怪物合作。例如，元帝奴役长颈鹿，把它们变成他们蛇国的边境哨兵。由于长颈鹿在它们的同类中是和平的，一些人类已经学会了如何接近一个群体的首领，提供食物和其他礼物，希望能与这些生物建立联盟。",
	"Girallons that are well treated might be willing to serve as guards, though they lack the intelligence to take on tasks more complicated than attacking strangers that enter their domain. If one is taken young and properly trained, a girallon could end up in a seemingly unlikely place, such as guarding the entrance to a city's thieves' guild. Those who would keep a girallon as a pet must always be wary, because the creature could revert to its predatory nature at any time.": "受到良好对待的吉拉龙可能愿意担任警卫，尽管它们缺乏智慧，无法承担比攻击进入它们领域的陌生人更复杂的任务。如果一只长颈鹿年幼并经过适当的训练，它可能会出现在一个看似不可能的地方，例如守卫城市的盗贼公会的入口。那些将吉拉龙作为宠物饲养的人必须始终保持警惕，因为这种生物随时都可能恢复其掠夺性。",
	" The ruins of humanoid habitations, especially those found in deep forests and jungles, seem to attract girallons. They move effortlessly along stairs and balconies, as well as on the sloped rooftops and buttresses of such formations. To a girallon, a city's buildings are just another sort of forest-and better yet, one whose uppermost \"branches\" can easily support the creatures. In such a setting, the girallons take full advantage of their skill in climbing. The creatures can easily scale walls and battlements, and they perch on tower tops and other high vantages to keep an eye on the surrounding area.": " 人类居住地的废墟，特别是那些在深山老林和丛林中发现的废墟，似乎吸引着长颈鹿。它们可以毫不费力地沿着楼梯和阳台移动，也可以在倾斜的屋顶和这些建筑的壁垒上移动。对Girallon来说，城市的建筑只是另一种森林，而且最好是最上面的 \"树枝 \"能够轻松地支撑起这些生物。在这样的环境中，Girallons充分利用它们的攀爬技能。这些生物可以很容易地攀爬墙壁和城墙，它们栖息在塔顶和其他高处，以监视周围的情况。",
	" The social habits of wild girallons are unusual for apes, as is their instinctive attraction to humanoid structures. These facts, together with the girallon's appearance, lead sages to believe that girallons were created through magic to serve as guardians for some lost empire. When that empire fell ages ago, girallons turned feral and spread out across the world.": " 野生长颈鹿的社会习惯对猿类来说是不寻常的，它们对人形结构的本能吸引也是如此。这些事实，再加上吉拉龙的外表，使圣人相信吉拉龙是通过魔法创造出来的，作为某个失落帝国的守护者。当那个帝国在很久以前灭亡时，吉拉龙变成了野蛮人，并在世界范围内蔓延开来。",
	"If any group of gnolls could be said to be more feral than the others, that distinction would go to the flesh gnawers. These gnolls eschew the use of ranged weapons in favor of short blades that they wield with speed and efficiency. In the thick of a fight, they are capable of dashing across the field, slashing and snarling as they run down stragglers and finish off wounded foes.": "如果说有哪一群地精可以说是比其他的地精更野性的话，那么这个区别将归于啃肉者。这些地精放弃了使用远程武器，而选择了他们以速度和效率挥舞的短刀。在激烈的战斗中，他们能够冲过战场，一边砍杀一边咆哮，击倒散兵游勇，解决掉受伤的敌人。",
	"Hunters are the stealthiest gnolls in a war band, and they put their talents to use on the battlefield in a number of ways. In the vanguard of a war band, hunters creep around, picking off isolated opposition while clearing the way for the rest of the force to run roughshod over the enemy's territory.": "猎人是战队中最隐蔽的地精，他们在战场上以多种方式发挥着自己的才能。在战队的前锋中，猎手悄悄地走来走去，干掉孤立的对手，同时为其他部队在敌人的领土上横冲直撞开辟道路。",
	"Hunters are particularly skilled with the longbow, and they fire arrows with viciously barbed heads. Even when a hunter doesn't kill its target with its first shot, the arrow strike brings so much pain that the victim is hobbled in its attempt to run away. When a hunter on the prowl finds prey and isn't concerned about remaining stealthy, it sounds a horn crafted from bone that produces a keening wail similar to a banshee's yell.": "猎人特别擅长使用长弓，他们射出的箭头上有恶毒的倒刺。即使猎人没有在第一时间杀死目标，箭的打击也会带来巨大的痛苦，以至于受害者在试图逃跑时步履蹒跚。当一个正在徘徊的猎人发现猎物，并且不关心如何保持隐蔽性时，它会吹响一个用骨头制作的号角，发出类似于女妖叫声的尖锐哀号。",
	"Sometimes gnolls turn against each other, perhaps to determine who rules a war band or because of extreme starvation. Even under ordinary circumstances, gnolls that are deprived of victims for too long can't control their hunger and violent urges. Eventually, they fight among themselves.": "有时，地精会互相反目，也许是为了决定谁统治一个战团，或者是因为极度饥饿。即使在普通情况下，被剥夺了受害者太久的地精也无法控制他们的饥饿和暴力冲动。最终，它们会相互厮杀。",
	"The survivors devour the flesh of their slain comrades but preserve the bones. Then, by invoking rituals to Yeenoghu, they bring the remains back to a semblance of life in the form of a gnoll witherling.": "幸存者吞噬了他们被杀的战友的肉，但保留了骨头。然后，通过对耶诺古的祈祷仪式，他们以地精枯萎的形式使遗体恢复了生命的模样。",
	"Witherlings act much as gnolls do in life, traveling with their comrades and trying to kill anything in their path. They don't eat and aren't motivated by hunger, leaving more flesh for the rest of the war band. Gnoll witherlings are incapable of wielding any weapon more sophisticated than a simple club.": "威瑟林的行为和地精在生活中的行为一样，与他们的同伴一起旅行，并试图杀死他们路上的任何东西。他们不吃东西，也不为饥饿所驱使，为战队的其他成员留下更多的肉体。地精小精灵无法挥舞任何比简单的棍棒更复杂的武器。",
	" A gnoll witherling doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": " 侏儒狼不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"I heard a warlock sought to magically turn the last witherlings of a destroyed gnoll war band into his own strike force against foes. That worked well until Yeenoghu sent seven war bands after him.": "我听说有一个术士试图用魔法把一个被摧毁的地精战队的最后的凋零者变成他自己的打击敌人的力量。这招很管用，直到耶诺古派了七个战队来对付他。",
	"Grungs are aggressive frog-like humanoids found in rain forests and tropical jungles. They are fiercely territorial and see themselves as superior to most other creatures.": "蛙人是在雨林和热带丛林中发现的具有攻击性的青蛙类人。它们有强烈的领地意识，认为自己比其他大多数生物更优越。",

From then on, the grung and its progeny are members of the higher caste.": "一个种姓的人通常会在其种姓中生活一辈子。在极少数情况下，一个以伟大事迹出众的人可以获得加入更高种姓的邀请。通过草药补剂和仪式魔法的结合，被提升的grung会改变颜色，并以与该种姓的青少年相同的方式加入新种姓。从那时起，grung和它的后代都是较高种姓的成员。",

A typical ki-rin looks like a muscular stag the size of an elephant, covered in golden scales lined in some places with golden fur. It has a dark gold mane and tail, coppery cloven hooves, and a spiral-shaped coppery horn just above and between its luminous violet eyes.

	"Beyond their coloration, ki-rins vary in appearance, based on the deity each one reveres and the function it typically performs in service to that god. Some are horse-shaped, looking like gigantic unicorns, and are often used as guardians. Others have draconic features and tend to be aggressive foes of evil. One horn is most common, but a ki-rin of fierce demeanor might have two horns or a set of antlers like those of a great stag.": "除了颜色之外，麒麟的外观也各不相同，这取决于每个麒麟所尊崇的神灵以及它通常为该神灵服务的功能。有些是马形，看起来像巨大的独角兽，通常被用作守护者。另一些则具有龙的特征，并倾向于成为邪恶的攻击性敌人。一只角是最常见的，但凶猛的麒麟可能有两只角，或像大鹿一样有一套鹿角。",
	"A ki-rin in the world claims a territory to watch over, and one ki-rin might safeguard an area that encompasses several nations. On other planes, ki-rins that serve good deities go wherever they are commanded, which could include coming to the Material Plane on a mission. A ki-rin disciple in the world usually serves its deity as a scout, a messenger, or a spy.": "世界上的麒麟声称要看守一个领土，一个麒麟可能会保护一个包括几个国家的地区。在其他位面，为善神服务的麒麟会去他们被命令的地方，这可能包括到物质位面执行任务。世界上的麒麟弟子通常作为侦察员、信使或间谍为其神灵服务。",
	"Ki-rins are attracted to the worship of deities of courage, loyalty, selflessness, and truth, as well as the advancement of just societies.

	"Many who seek a ki-rin's guidance end up pledging service to the creature. They study as monks under its tutelage and serve as its agents in the world.

	" Common folk consider ki-rins to be rare and remote heralds of good fortune. Seeing a ki-rin fly overhead is a blessing, and events that happen on such a day are especially auspicious. If a ki-rin alights during a ceremony, such as a birth announcement or a coronation, everyone present understands that the creature is telling them great good could be in the offing. The ki-rin conveys its gifts and omens, then rises back into the sky. Ki-rins have also been known to appear at the sites of great battles to inspire and strengthen the side of good, or to rescue heroes from certain death.": " 普通人认为麒麟是罕见的、遥远的幸运预兆。看到麒麟从头顶飞过是一种祝福，在这样的日子里发生的事件特别吉利。如果麒麟在一个仪式上降落，如宣布出生或加冕仪式，在场的每个人都会明白，这个生物在告诉他们可能会有巨大的好事发生。麒麟传达了它的礼物和预兆，然后升回了天空。人们还知道麒麟会出现在伟大的战斗现场，以激励和加强善良的一方，或将英雄从死亡线上拯救出来。",
	" Because a ki-rin is renowned for its wisdom, other creatures would naturally seek it out with questions and requests if they could.

Only those that have the tenacity to complete the daunting journey to a ki-rin's lair can prove themselves worthy of speaking with its occupant.": " 因为麒麟以其智慧而闻名，如果可以的话，其他生物自然会找它询问和请求。出于这个原因，这种生物把它的巢穴建在一个令人望而却步的山顶上，或者在其他同样难以到达的地方。只有那些有毅力完成前往麒麟巢穴的艰巨旅程的人，才能证明自己有资格与巢穴的主人交谈。",
	"On the celestial planes, ki-rins reside in lofty, elegant aeries filled with luxurious objects. In the world, a ki-rin chooses a similar location, such as atop a tall pinnacle or within a cloud solidified by the ki-rin's magic. When viewed from the outside, a ki-rin's lair is indistinguishable from a natural site, and the entrance is difficult for visitors to find and reach. Inside, the lair is a serene and comfortable place, its ambiance a mix between palace and temple. If the ki-rin has taken creatures into its service, its lair doubles as a sacred site wherein the ki-rin not only rests, but also teaches of holy mysteries.": "在天体上，麒麟居住在崇高、优雅的房间里，里面充满了奢华的物品。在这个世界上，麒麟会选择一个类似的地点，比如在一个高大的山峰上，或者在一个由麒麟的魔法凝固的云中。从外面看，麒麟的巢穴与自然场所没有区别，而且游客很难找到和到达入口。在里面，巢穴是一个宁静而舒适的地方，其氛围是宫殿和寺庙的混合体。如果麒麟将生物纳入其服务范围，它的巢穴就会成为一个神圣的场所，麒麟不仅在这里休息，而且还教授神圣的奥秘。",
	"A kobold dragonshield is a champion of its race. Almost all dragonshields begin life as normal kobolds, then are chosen by a dragon and invested with great powers for the purpose of protecting the dragon's eggs, but once every few years a kobold hatches with an innate version of the dragonshield's abilities. Accomplished at hand-to-hand combat, it bears many scars from desperate fights and carries a shield made out of cast-off dragon scales.": "哥布林龙盾是其种族的冠军。几乎所有的龙盾开始时都是普通的哥布林，然后被龙选中并赋予强大的力量以保护龙蛋，但每隔几年就会孵化出一个具有龙盾能力的先天版本的哥布林。它擅长徒手搏斗，身上有许多拼命搏斗的伤痕，并带着一个由废弃的龙鳞制成的盾牌。",
	" A dragonshield knows that it has a place of honor in the tribe, but-being kobolds at heart-most of them feel unworthy of their status and thus desperate to prove themselves deserving of it. A dragonshield's natural kobold cowardice is still present in its makeup, and thus it might still run away from a threat. But it also has the ability to rally in the face of certain death, inspiring other kobolds to follow it in a charge against the invaders of their warren.": " 龙盾知道自己在部落里有一个荣誉的位置，但作为内心深处的哥布林，他们大多数人都觉得自己的地位不值一提，因此急于证明自己配得上这个地位。龙盾的天生的哥布林懦弱性仍然存在于它的构成中，因此它仍然可能在遇到威胁时逃跑。但它也有能力在面对死亡时团结起来，激励其他哥布林跟随它一起冲锋陷阵，打击入侵它们的巢穴的人。",
	"A kobold inventor, crafty and with quick hands, builds improvised weapons in the hope of gaining some new advantage in combat. An inventor captures bugs, scoops up exotic dungeon slimes, and claims the best stolen goods as ingredients in its experiments. Its creations are sometimes comical in appearance, but-like kobolds' traps-they work a lot better than their materials would suggest.": "一个哥布林发明家，狡猾且手脚麻利，建造了简易的武器，希望在战斗中获得一些新的优势。发明家捕捉虫子，舀起异国情调的地牢粘液，并要求将最好的赃物作为其实验的材料。它的作品有时在外观上很滑稽，但就像哥布林的陷阱一样，它们的效果比它们的材料所显示的要好很多。",
	" An inventor's new weapons last for only one or two attacks before they break, but might be surprisingly effective in the meantime. Most inventors are skilled enough that their improvised weapons don't backfire on them, but other users might not be so lucky. The weapons don't have to be lethal-in many cases one serves its purpose if it distracts, scares, or confuses a creature long enough for other kobolds to kill the enemy. In any particular encounter, an inventor usually has one or two improvised weapons at its disposal.": " 一个发明家的新武器在损坏前只能持续一到两次攻击，但在此期间可能会有惊人的效果。大多数发明家都很熟练，他们的简易武器不会对他们产生反作用，但其他使用者可能就没那么幸运了。这些武器不一定是致命的--在许多情况下，如果它能分散、吓唬或迷惑一个生物足够长的时间让其他哥布林杀死敌人，它就达到了目的。在任何特定的遭遇中，一个发明家通常有一到两件简易武器可供支配。",
	"A kobold scale sorcerer has an innate talent for arcane magic, making it a highly valuable member of the tribe for several reasons. Because the kobolds' deity remains imprisoned, most tribes lack individuals that can use divine magic, and so the scale sorcerers fill the roles of advisor and historian. In times of peace, they use their spells to fortify and enhance the warren and aid the rest of the tribe. When the tribe is threatened, a scale sorcerer lashes out with fire and poison against enemies, saving a bit of magic for itself in case it needs to flee or take advantage of a captor.": "哥布林人的鳞片巫师在奥术方面具有与生俱来的天赋，这使得它成为部落中非常有价值的成员，原因有几个。由于哥布林的神灵仍然被囚禁着，大多数部落都缺乏能够使用神术的人，因此鳞片巫师就充当了顾问和历史学家的角色。在和平时期，他们用自己的法术来加固和加强战地，并帮助部落的其他成员。当部落受到威胁时，鳞片巫师会用火和毒药攻击敌人，为自己保留一点魔法，以备逃跑或利用俘虏的机会。",
	" In a kobold tribe associated with a dragon, typically one that resides in or near the dragon's lair, the scale sorcerer also serves as diplomat and mouthpiece-anticipating the dragon's needs, issuing commands to other kobolds on the dragon's behalf, and reporting information back to the dragon. The sorcerer is just as awed by and respectful of dragons as common kobolds are, but it knows that its duty requires it not to fawn over its master at all times. It also understands that its frequent proximity to the dragon means it would probably be the first to die if its master became angry or displeased, and so it frantically maintains a balance between adoration and terror in its behavior toward the dragon.": " 在与龙有关的哥布林部落中，通常是居住在龙的巢穴中或附近的部落，鳞片巫师还充当外交官和传声筒--预测龙的需求，代表龙向其他哥布林发布命令，并向龙汇报信息。巫师和普通哥布林一样，对龙感到敬畏和尊重，但它知道自己的职责要求它不能随时向主人献媚。它也明白，它经常接近龙意味着如果它的主人生气或不高兴，它可能会第一个死掉，所以它在对龙的行为上疯狂地保持着崇拜和恐怖之间的平衡。",
	"Never make the mistake of thinking kobolds are stupid or backward just because they're small. Size has nothing to do with it.": "千万不要因为哥布林很小就错误地认为它们很愚蠢或落后。尺寸与此毫无关系。",
	"Korreds are unpredictable, secretive fey with strong ties to earth and stone. Because of their magical hair and their mystical understanding of minerals, they are sought after by treasure-hunters, dwarves, and others that desire wealth beneath the earth.": "科瑞德是不可预知的、神秘的精灵，与大地和石头有着密切的联系。由于他们有神奇的头发和对矿物的神秘理解，他们被寻宝者、矮人和其他渴望地底财富的人所追捧。",
	" Korreds prefer to keep their own company and occasionally consort with creatures of elemental earth such as galeb duhr. A tribe of korreds gathers weekly to perform ceremonial dances, beating out rhythms on stone with their hooves and clubs. In the depths of the Material Plane, korreds typically flee from other creatures but become aggressive when they feel insulted or are annoyed by the sounds of mining.": " KORRED喜欢与自己为伴，偶尔也会与土元素的生物如Galeb duhr交欢。一个科瑞德部落每周都会聚集在一起表演仪式性的舞蹈，用他们的蹄子和棍子在石头上打出节奏。在物质世界的深处，科瑞德通常会逃离其他生物，但当他们感到被侮辱或被采矿的声音所烦扰时，就会变得很有攻击性。",
	"Korreds can hurl boulders far larger than it seems they should be able to, shape stone as though it were clay, swim through rock, and summon earth elementals and other creatures. They also gain supernatural strength just from standing on the ground.": "科瑞德可以投掷远比他们看起来应该能够投掷的更大的巨石，把石头塑造成像粘土一样，在岩石中游泳，并召唤土元素和其他生物。他们还可以通过站在地上获得超自然的力量。",
	"There's a legend about a merchant who tried to cut a korred's hair with golden shears. The korred fed him those shears, from his swallow to his sitter.": "有一个关于一个商人的传说，他试图用金色的剪子剪掉Korred的头发。科瑞德把这些剪子喂给他，从他的燕子到他的坐骑。",
	" No one knows the ways of stone and earth better than a korred. Korreds can seemingly smell veins of metal or gems. A korred on the surface can feel the rise and fall of bedrock under the earth and where caves lie, and underground it knows the pathways through the stone for miles. Secret doors that lead through stone are as obvious as windows to a korred.": " 没有人比科瑞德更了解石头和地球的方式。科瑞德似乎可以闻到金属或宝石的矿脉。地表上的科瑞德可以感觉到地下基岩的起伏，以及洞穴所在的位置，而在地下，它知道穿过石头的路径有几英里。对科瑞德来说，穿过石头的秘密门就像窗户一样明显。",
	" Korreds have hair all over their bodies, but the hair that grows from their heads is magical. When cut, it transforms into whatever material was used to cut it. Korreds use iron shears to cut lengths of their hair, then weave the strands together to create iron ropes that they can manipulate, animating them to bind or snake around creatures and objects. Korreds take great pride in their hair, and equally great offense at any one who attempts to cut it without permission.": " Korreds全身都有毛发，但从他们头上长出的毛发是神奇的。当被剪断时，它就会转化为用于剪断的任何材料。科瑞德人用铁剪剪下长长的头发，然后把这些发丝编织在一起，形成他们可以操纵的铁绳，使它们成为束缚生物和物体的灵动的绳索。科勒德人对自己的头发感到非常自豪，对任何试图未经允许就剪掉头发的人也同样感到非常愤怒。",
	"A kraken can seem godlike to folk who have witnessed its fury. Those who mistake its might for divine power and those who seek to appease the monster through veneration are sometimes rewarded with power, to serve thereafter as kraken priests.": "对那些目睹了它的愤怒的人们来说，海怪可以看起来像神一样。那些把它的威力误认为是神力的人，以及那些试图通过崇拜来安抚怪物的人，有时会得到力量的奖励，并在此后作为克拉肯的祭司服务。",
	"The kraken can make itself dimly aware of a kraken priest's thoughts if the two are on the same plane of existence, and it can then push aside the priest's personality and control it. Kraken priests can thereby act as eyes and ears for their masters, and when the kraken has something to say, the priest becomes its mouthpiece.": "如果两者在同一个存在平面上，克拉肯可以让自己模糊地意识到克拉肯祭司的想法，然后它可以推开祭司的人格并控制它。海怪祭司因此可以充当其主人的眼睛和耳朵，当海怪有话要说时，祭司就会成为它的传声筒。",
	"Every kraken priest undergoes a change in appearance that reflects the kraken's influence, although each one differs in how its reverence is displayed. One kraken priest might have ink-black eyes and a suckered tentacle for a tongue, while another has a featureless face and a body covered in eyes and mouths that dribble seawater. These horrific manifestations intensify when the kraken possesses its minion to utter its dire pronouncements.": "每个海怪祭司的外表都会发生变化，反映出海怪的影响，尽管每个人在展示其敬畏的方式上都有所不同。一个海怪祭司可能有一双墨黑的眼睛和一条被吸住的触手作为舌头，而另一个则有一张没有特征的脸和一个布满眼睛和嘴的身体，会滴下海水。当克拉肯附身在它的奴仆身上发表可怕的声明时，这些可怕的表现会更加强烈。",
	"A leucrotta is what you would get if you took the head of a giant badger, the brain of a person who likes to torture and eat people, the legs of a deer, and the body of a large hyena, put them together, and reanimated them with demon ichor without bothering to cover up the stink of death.": "如果你把一只大獾的头、一个喜欢折磨和吃人的人的大脑、一只鹿的腿和一只大鬣狗的身体放在一起，用恶魔的胆汁使它们复活，而不去掩盖死亡的臭味，那么你就会得到一个leucrotta。",
	" The first leucrottas came into being alongside the gnolls during Yeenoghu's rampages on the Material Plane. Some of the hyenas that ate Yeenoghu's kills went through different transformations rather than turning into gnolls.

	"As clever as it is cruel, a leucrotta loves to deceive, torture, and kill. Because leucrottas are smarter and tougher than most gnolls, one could occupy an elevated position within a gnoll tribe. Although a leucrotta is unlikely to lead a group of gnolls, it can influence the leader, and it might even agree to carry a leader into battle and offer advice during the fight.": "聪明而又残忍，利库塔人喜欢欺骗、折磨和杀戮。由于利古塔比大多数地精更聪明、更强硬，它可以在地精部落中占据一个较高的位置。虽然利库塔不太可能领导一群地精，但它可以影响领导者，它甚至可能同意携带领导者参加战斗，并在战斗中提供建议。",
	"Gnolls see leucrottas as a form of entertainment, partly because a leucrotta can mimic the squeals of a suffering victim-a sound that always gives gnolls pleasure-even when no victims are to be had. Further, a gnoll is bloodthirsty and sadistic, but unable by its nature to prolong the fun of killing. Most leucrottas are consciously cruel, to the point of being meticulous about their savagery to draw out a kill into better and longer sport. Gnolls enjoy watching a leucrotta work almost as much as they like doing their own killing.": "地精把白鼬视为一种娱乐方式，部分原因是白鼬可以模仿痛苦的受害者的尖叫声--这种声音总是让地精感到快乐，即使没有受害者。此外，地精是嗜血和虐待狂，但由于其本性，无法延长杀人的乐趣。大多数地精都是有意识的残忍，以至于对自己的野蛮行为一丝不苟，把杀戮引向更好、更长久的运动。地精喜欢看白鼬的工作，几乎和他们喜欢自己杀人一样。",
	"A leucrotta's stench would normally warn away prey long before the creature could attack. It has two natural capabilities, however, that give it an advantage. First, a leucrotta's tracks are nearly impossible to distinguish from those of common deer. Second, it can duplicate the call or the vocal expressions of just about any creature it has heard. The monster uses its mimicry to lure in potential victims, then attacks when they are confused or unaware of the actual threat.": "通常情况下，白鹦鹉的臭味会在其攻击前很久就警告猎物。然而，它有两个自然能力，使它具有优势。首先，白头翁的足迹几乎不可能与普通鹿的足迹相区别。其次，它可以复制它所听到的几乎所有生物的叫声或声音表达。这种怪物利用其模仿能力来引诱潜在的受害者，然后在他们感到困惑或没有意识到实际威胁的时候进行攻击。",
	" The leucrotta is so loathsome that only gnolls and others of its kind can stand to be around one for long. Its horrific, hodgepodge body oozes a foul stench that pollutes anywhere the creature lairs. This reek is outdone only by the creature's breath, which issues from a maw that drips fluid corrupted with rot and digestive juices. In place of fangs, a leucrotta has bony ridges as hard as steel that can crush bones and lacerate flesh. These plates are so tough that a leucrotta can use them to peel plate armor away from the body of a slain knight.": " 莱克洛塔是如此令人厌恶，以至于只有地精和其他同类可以忍受长时间与它相处。它那可怕的、大杂烩式的身体渗出一种恶臭，污染了该生物的任何地方。这种恶臭仅次于该生物的呼吸，它从一个滴着腐烂和消化液的大口中发出的气息。作为獠牙的替代物，白喉有像钢铁一样坚硬的骨脊，可以压碎骨头和撕裂肉体。这些板块是如此坚硬，以至于白喉人可以用它们来剥去被杀骑士身上的板甲。",
	"Martial arts adepts are disciplined monks with extensive training in hand-to-hand combat. Some protect monasteries; others travel the world seeking enlightenment or new forms of combat to master. A few become bodyguards, trading their combat prowess and loyalty for food and lodging.": "武术专家是经过广泛的徒手格斗训练的有纪律的僧侣。有些人保护寺院；有些人则周游世界，寻求开悟或掌握新的战斗形式。少数人成为保镖，用他们的战斗力和忠诚度换取食物和住宿。",
	"Master thieves are known for perpetrating daring heists. They tend to develop a reputation and a cult of personality. A master thief might \"retire\" from hands-on work to run a thieves' guild, spearhead some covert enterprise, or enjoy a quiet life of luxury.": "盗贼大师以实施大胆的抢劫而闻名。他们往往会形成一种声誉和人格崇拜。盗贼大师可能会从实际工作中 \"退休\"，管理一个盗贼公会，领导一些秘密企业，或享受安静的奢侈生活。",

	" Meenlocks are spawned by fear. Whenever fear overwhelms a creature in the Feywild, or in any other location where the Feywild's influence is strong, one or more meenlocks might spontaneously arise in the shadows or darkness nearby. If more than one meenlock is born, a lair also magically forms. The earth creaks and moans as narrow, twisting tunnels open up within it. One of these newly formed passageways serves as the lair's only entrance and exit.": " Meenlocks是由恐惧催生的。每当恐惧压倒了仙境中的生物，或在仙境影响强烈的任何其他地方，一个或多个门锁可能会在附近的阴影或黑暗中自发产生。如果有一个以上的门锁诞生，一个巢穴也会神奇地形成。大地嘎吱嘎吱地呻吟着，狭窄、扭曲的隧道在其中打开。这些新形成的通道中，有一条是巢穴的唯一入口和出口。",
	"Meenlocks give other creatures the creeps and project a supernatural aura that instills terror in those nearby. So evil and twisted are they that a palpable sense of foreboding haunts those who intrude upon a meenlock lair. Inside the warren, black moss covers every surface, muffling sound. A large central chamber serves as the meenlocks' den, where they torment captives.": "蛤蚧让其他生物感到毛骨悚然，并投射出一种超自然的光环，给附近的人带来恐怖。它们是如此邪恶和扭曲，以至于那些闯入米恩洛克巢穴的人都有一种明显的不祥之感。在这个巢穴里，黑色的苔藓覆盖了每一个表面，使声音变得很低。一个大的中央房间是米诺克人的巢穴，他们在那里折磨俘虏。",
	"During the day, meenlocks confine themselves to their dark warrens. At night, they crawl out of their tunnels to torment sleeping prey, particularly those who seem to embody all that is good in the world. Meenlocks like to paralyze creatures with their claws, drag them back to their hidden den, beat them unconscious, and telepathically torture them over a period of hours. A humanoid that succumbs to this psychic torment undergoes a transformation into an evil, full-grown meenlock (see the \"Telepathic Torment\" sidebar).": "白天，meenlocks把自己限制在他们黑暗的巢穴里。到了晚上，它们会爬出隧道，折磨沉睡的猎物，尤其是那些似乎体现了世界上所有美好事物的猎物。Meenlocks喜欢用它们的爪子麻痹生物，把它们拖回它们隐藏的巢穴，把它们打昏，并在几个小时内用心灵感应折磨它们。屈服于这种精神折磨的人，会转变为一个邪恶的、成熟的米诺克人（见 \"心灵感应的折磨 \"侧栏）。",
	" A meenlock shuns bright light. It can supernaturally sense areas of darkness and shadow in its vicinity and thus is able to teleport from one darkened space to another-enabling it to sneak up on its prey or run away when outmatched.": " 米恩锁避开强光。它能超自然地感知周围的黑暗和阴影区域，因此能够从一个黑暗的空间传送到另一个黑暗的空间，使它能够偷袭猎物或在不敌时逃跑。",
	" Meenlocks have no form of communication other than telepathy. They can use it to project unsettling hallucinations into the minds of their prey. These hallucinations take the form of terrible whispers or fleeting movements just at the edges of one's peripheral vision.": " Meenlocks除了心灵感应外没有其他的交流方式。他们可以利用心灵感应将令人不安的幻觉投射到猎物的头脑中。这些幻觉的形式是可怕的低语或在人的周围视野边缘转瞬即逝的运动。",
	"Up to four meenlocks can telepathically torment one {@condition incapacitated} creature, filling its mind with disturbing sounds and dreadful imagery.

If the creature is susceptible and remains {@condition incapacitated} for 1 hour, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 10 ({@damage 3d6}) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The save DC is 10 + the number of meenlocks participating in the torment, considering only those that remain within sight of the victim for the entire hour and aren't {@condition incapacitated} during it. The process can be repeated. A humanoid that drops to 0 hit points as a result of this damage instantly transforms into a meenlock at full health and under the DM's control. Only a {@spell wish} spell or divine intervention can restore a transformed creature to its former state.": "最多四个meenlocks可以用心灵感应折磨一个{@condition incapacitated}的生物，用令人不安的声音和可怕的图像填充它的头脑。在这段时间内，参与的meenlocks不能为任何其他目的使用他们的心灵感应，尽管他们可以像正常人一样行动和做出反应。这种折磨对对{@condition frightened}条件免疫的生物没有影响。如果该生物易受影响，并在1小时内保持{@condition incapacitated}的状态，该生物必须进行智慧救赎，如果救赎失败，将受到10({@damage 3d6})的精神伤害，如果救赎成功，将受到一半的伤害。救赎DC是10+参与折磨的meenlocks的数量，只考虑那些在整个小时内都在受害者视线范围内的，并且在折磨过程中没有{@condition incapacitated}。这个过程可以重复进行。由于这种伤害而下降到0命中率的类人，会立即转化为一个完全健康并受DM控制的meenlock。只有{@spell wish}的法术或神明的干预才能将变身后的生物恢复到以前的状态。",

Illithids prefer to communicate via telepathy and use their telepathy when issuing commands to their thralls.": "自从他们的帝国灭亡后，物质界的伊里特人集体就居住在暗黑世界。幻象指挥者。幻心者拥有幻觉的力量，使他们能够控制诸如troglodytes、grimlocks、quaggoths和食人魔等生物的思想。伊利特人更喜欢通过心灵感应进行交流，并在向他们的王族发布命令时使用他们的心灵感应。",
	"When an illithid meets strong resistance, it avoids initial combat as it orders its thralls to attack. Like physical extensions of the illithid's thoughts, these thralls interpose themselves between the mind flayer and its foes, sacrificing their lives so that their master can escape.": "当Illithid遇到强大的抵抗时，它就会避免最初的战斗，因为它命令它的王族去攻击。就像Illithid思想的物理延伸一样，这些鲛人在噬心者和它的敌人之间穿插，牺牲自己的生命，让它们的主人能够逃脱。",
	" Solitary mind flayers are likely rogues and outcasts.

	"An illithid experiences euphoria as it devours the brain of a humanoid, along with its memories, personality, and innermost fears. Mind flayers will sometimes harvest a brain rather than devour it, using it as part of some alien experiment or transforming it into an intellect devourer.": "一个illithid在吞噬一个人形生物的大脑时，会体验到欣快感，同时还有它的记忆、个性和内心深处的恐惧。噬心者有时会收获一个大脑，而不是吞噬它，把它作为一些外星实验的一部分，或者把它转化为一个智力吞噬者。",
	"Qualith": "奎里特",
	"On the rare occasion that mind flayers need to write something down, they do so in Qualith. This system of tactile writing (similar to braille) is read by an illithid's tentacles. Qualith is written in four-line stanzas and is so alien in construction that non-illithids must resort to magic to discern its meaning. Though Qualith can be used to keep records, illithids most often use it to mark portals or other surfaces with warnings or instructions.": "在极少的情况下，如果心灵传播者需要写下一些东西，他们就会用Qualith来做。这种触觉书写系统（类似于盲文）可以通过illithid的触手来阅读。Qualith是用四行诗句写成的，其结构非常奇怪，非illithids必须借助魔法才能辨别其含义。虽然Qualith可以用来保存记录，但illithids最常使用它来标记门户或其他表面的警告或指示。",

Countless islands of mixed matter spun away into the silvery void. Within some of them, a vein of pearl-like material held a bit of the deity's rejuvenated supernatural vitality, which spontaneously created a habitable environment. On those same islands, bits of the god's petrified flesh came back to life, in the form of tentacled monstrosities brimming with malice and greed.

If not, the hill giant is instead starved to the point of madness so that Grolantor's hunger can be given a mouth in the world.": "族人将生病的巨人与其他人分开，通常将巨人困在笼子里或将巨人绑在柱子上。Grolantor的牧师或酋长每天都会去看望饥肠辘辘的巨人，试图从山丘巨人呕出的一滩滩胆汁中读出预兆。如果病痛很快就会过去，山丘巨人就可以重新加入社会了。如果没有，山丘巨人反而会被饿得发狂，这样Grolantor的饥饿就可以在这个世界上得到一个口。",
	" A mouth of Grolantor is so disgraced that it ceases to be an individual and becomes an object. Paradoxically, that object is revered as a holy embodiment of Grolantor's eternal, aching hunger. Unlike a typical thick, sluggish, half-asleep hill giant, a mouth of Grolantor is thin as a whippet, alert like a bird, and constantly twitching around the edges. A mouth of Grolantor is kept perpetually imprisoned or shackled; if it breaks free, it's sure to kill a few hill giants before it's brought down or it sprints away on a killing spree. The only time a mouth of Grolantor is set loose is during a war, a raid against an enemy settlement, or in a last-ditch defense of the tribe's home. When the mouth of Grolantor has slaughtered and eaten its fill of the tribe's enemies, it passes out amid the gory remains of its victims, making it easy to recapture.": " Grolantor的嘴是如此的不光彩，以至于它不再是一个个体而成为一个物体。矛盾的是，这个物体被尊称为Grolantor永恒的、痛苦的饥饿的神圣化身。与典型的厚重、呆滞、半睡半醒的山丘巨人不同，Grolantor的嘴瘦得像条鞭子，警觉得像只鸟，并且在边缘不断抽动。Grolantor之口被永久地囚禁或戴上镣铐；如果它挣脱了，它肯定会在被放倒之前杀死几个山地巨人，或者它冲出去大开杀戒。Grolantor之口唯一被释放的时间是在战争期间，对敌方定居点的突袭，或对部落的家园进行最后的防御。当Grolantor之口屠杀并吃饱了部落的敌人后，它就会在受害者的血肉模糊的残骸中昏迷过去，这样就很容易被抓回来。",
	"Necromancers are specialist wizards who study the interaction of life, death, and undeath. Some like to dig up corpses to create undead slaves. A few use their powers for good, becoming hunters of the undead and risking their lives to save others.": "亡灵巫师是研究生命、死亡和不死的互动关系的专业巫师。有些人喜欢挖出尸体，制造不死的奴隶。少数人利用他们的力量做好事，成为亡灵猎人，冒着生命危险去拯救他人。",
	"Neogi are hateful slavers that consider most other creatures, even weaker neogi, to be servants and prey. A neogi looks like an outsize spider with an eel's neck and head. The creature can poison the body and the mind of its target, able to subjugate other beings that are otherwise physically superior.": "Neogi是可恨的奴隶主，他们认为大多数其他生物，甚至是弱小的Neogi，都是仆人和猎物。Neogi看起来像一只大蜘蛛，有一个鳗鱼的脖子和头。这种生物可以毒害其目标的身体和思想，能够征服其他在身体上有优势的生物。",
	" Neogi usually dwell in far-flung locations on the Material Plane, as well as in the Feywild, the Shadowfell, and the Astral and Ethereal Planes. They invaded the world long ago from a remote location on the Material Plane, abandoning their home to conquer and devour creatures in other realms. To meet their need to navigate great distances, the neogi first dominated and assimilated the umber hulks of another lost world. Then, with these slaves providing the physical labor, the neogi designed and built sleek vessels, some capable of traversing the planes, to carry them to their new frontiers. Some neogi groups still create and use such vehicles, which have a distinct spidery aspect.": " Neogi通常居住在物质世界的遥远地点，以及Feywild、Shadowfell、Astral和Ethereal Planes。很久以前，他们从物质界的一个偏远地点入侵世界，放弃了自己的家园，去征服和吞噬其他领域的生物。为了满足他们远距离航行的需要，Neogi首先支配并同化了另一个失落世界的乌木残骸。然后，在这些奴隶提供体力劳动的情况下，neogi设计并建造了光滑的船只，其中一些能够穿越平面，把他们带到新的疆域。一些neogi团体仍然在创造和使用这种具有明显蜘蛛网状特征的交通工具。",
	"Some neogi use magic-the result of a pact between the neogi and aberrant entities they met during their journey from their home world. These entities look like stars and embody the essence of evil. They are known by such names as Acamar, Caiphon, Gibbeth, and Hadar.": "有些neogi使用魔法--这是neogi和他们在离开母体世界的旅途中遇到的反常实体之间的约定的结果。这些实体看起来像星星，体现了邪恶的本质。他们的名字是Acamar、Caiphon、Gibbeth和Hadar等。",
	"Nothing about the neogi is more unfathomable than their mentality. Because they have the power to control minds, neogi consider doing so to be entirely appropriate. Their society makes no distinction between individuals, aside from the ability that a given creature has to control others, and they don't comprehend the emotional aspects of existence that humans and similar beings experience. To a neogi, hatred is as foreign a sensation as love, and showing loyalty in the absence of authority is foolishness.": "关于neogi，没有什么比他们的心态更深不可测了。因为他们有控制思想的能力，Neogi认为这样做是完全合适的。他们的社会对个人没有任何区别，除了一个特定的生物具有控制他人的能力之外，他们不理解人类和类似生命所经历的存在的情感方面。对Neogi来说，仇恨和爱一样是一种陌生的感觉，而在没有权威的情况下表现出忠诚是愚蠢的。",
	"Neogi mark themselves and their slaves through the use of dyes, transformational magic, and tattoos intended to signify rank, achievements, and ownership. By these signs, each neogi can identify its betters-and it must defer to those of higher station or risk harsh punishment.": "Neogi通过使用染料、变形魔法和纹身来标记他们自己和他们的奴隶，旨在表示等级、成就和所有权。通过这些标志，每个Neogi都能识别出它的优胜者--它必须服从于那些地位更高的人，否则就会受到严厉的惩罚。",
	"Damn eel-spiders want to enslave us all! And no, they don't taste good.": "该死的鳗鱼蜘蛛想奴役我们所有人！？而且，它们的味道并不好。",
	"Outside the obligations of a servant to its master, neogi are willing to engage in any activity that profits them, and they are as devious as devils when doing so. Neogi buy and sell, but they pose a grave risk to potential patrons that might instead be easily enslaved, so their customers generally consist of desperate or evil individuals, or creatures that are formidable enough to treat with the neogi as equals. Neogi traders might set up shop in a planar bazaar, on the edge of a drow city, or near a mind flayer enclave. In other locations, the natives are more likely to join together to destroy a neogi caravan than to allow it safe conduct and trading privileges.": "在仆人对主人的义务之外，Neogi愿意从事任何能使他们获利的活动，而且在这样做的时候，他们像魔鬼一样狡猾。Neogi进行买卖，但他们对潜在的主顾构成严重的风险，而这些主顾可能反而容易被奴役，所以他们的客户一般由绝望的人或邪恶的人组成，或者是那些足以与Neogi平等相待的生物。Neogi商人可能会在一个平面集市、一个乌鸦城市的边缘、或靠近一个精神分裂者的飞地开店。在其他地方，当地人更有可能联合起来摧毁一个Neogi商队，而不是让它安全通行并获得贸易特权。",
	" A neogi lives about as long as a human, and like a human it faces physical and mental infirmity as it ages. When an individual is rendered weak by advanced age, the other neogi in the group overpower it and inject it with a special poison. The toxin transforms the old neogi into a bloated, helpless mass of flesh called a great old master. Young neogi lay their eggs atop it, and when the hatchlings emerge, they devour the great old master and one another, until only a few of the strongest newborns are left.": " 一个neogi的寿命和人类差不多，和人类一样，随着年龄的增长，它面临着身体和精神的衰弱。当一个个体因年老而变得虚弱时，群体中的其他neogi就会制服它并给它注射一种特殊的毒药。这种毒素将老Neogi变成一个臃肿、无助的肉块，称为伟大的老主人。年轻的Neogi在它上面产卵，当孵化出的幼崽出现时，它们会吞噬大老爷和彼此，直到只剩下几个最强壮的新生儿。",
	" Surviving neogi hatchlings begin their lives under the control of adult neogi. They must learn about their society and earn a place in it, and each one starts its training by gaining mastery over a young umber hulk.": " 幸存的neogi幼崽在成年neogi的控制下开始他们的生活。它们必须了解自己的社会，并在其中赢得一席之地，每一只都是通过获得对一个年轻的乌合之众的掌握来开始训练的。",
	"A slime-covered worm of immense size, a neothelid is the result of the mind flayer reproductive cycle gone horribly wrong. On rare occasions, an illithid colony collapses, typically after an external assault, and the elder brain is killed. When that happens, the colony's tadpoles are suddenly freed from their fate. They no longer serve as food, and in turn are no longer fed by their caretakers. Driven by hunger, they turn to devouring one another. Only one tadpole survives out of the thousands in the colony's pool, and it emerges as a neothelid.": "一种体积巨大的粘液包裹的蠕虫，新铁皮人是心智障碍者繁殖周期出了可怕的问题的结果。在极少数情况下，一个illithid群落会崩溃，通常是在受到外部攻击后，老脑被杀死。当这种情况发生时，群体中的蝌蚪突然从他们的命运中解放出来。它们不再作为食物，反过来也不再被它们的看护者喂养。在饥饿的驱使下，它们转而相互吞噬。群体池中的数千只蝌蚪中，只有一只蝌蚪幸存下来，它成为了新潮汐动物。",
	" Among the strongest taboos in illithid society is the idea of allowing a mature tadpole to survive without implanting it into a donor brain. Under normal circumstances, any tadpole that grows larger than a few inches in length is killed by the elder brain to be food for it or for less mature tadpoles. Any tadpole that survives beyond that state is perceived as a threat to the colony, and the mind flayers organize hunting parties to exterminate the abomination. Lacking enough intelligence to be detected by an elder brain's power to sense thoughts, neothelids warrant such precautions.": " 在illithid社会中，最强烈的禁忌是允许成熟的蝌蚪存活而不把它植入供体的大脑。在正常情况下，任何生长超过几英寸长的蝌蚪都会被长者大脑杀死，成为它或不太成熟的蝌蚪的食物。任何超过这种状态的蝌蚪都会被认为是对群体的威胁，而噬心者会组织狩猎队来消灭这种可憎的东西。由于缺乏足够的智力，无法被长者大脑感知思想的能力所察觉，新潮人需要采取这种预防措施。",
	" As a feral thing, a neothelid knows nothing beyond the predatory existence it has lived so far and struggles to comprehend its new psionic abilities. Neothelids prowl subterranean passages in search of more brains to sate their constant hunger, growing ever more vicious. These creatures can spray tissue-dissolving enzymes from their tentacle ducts, reducing victims to a puddle of slime and leaving only the pulsing brain unharmed. They have no knowledge of their link to illithids, so they're just as likely to prey on mind flayers as on anything else.": " 作为一种野性的东西，新潮人除了迄今为止的掠夺性生活外一无所知，并努力理解其新的幻觉能力。蝾螈在地下通道游荡，寻找更多的大脑来满足它们持续的饥饿感，变得越来越凶恶。这些生物可以从它们的触手管道中喷出溶解组织的酶，使受害者变成一滩粘液，只留下脉动的大脑不受伤害。它们不知道自己与illithids的联系，所以它们就像捕食其他东西一样，可能捕食心魔。",
	"When Maglubiyet conquered the goblin gods, he intended to leave only Khurgorbaeyag alive as a harsh overseer who would keep the goblins under heel. But the goblins' pantheon included a trickster deity who was determined to get the last laugh. Although its essence was shattered by Maglubiyet, this trickster god survives in splintered form as a possessing spirit that arises when goblinoids form a host, causing disorder in the ranks unless it is appeased. Goblins have no name for this deity and dare not give it one, lest Maglubiyet use its name to ensnare and crush it as he did their other deities. They call the possessing spirit, and the goblin possessed by it, a nilbog (\"goblin\" spelled backward), and they revel in the fear that a nilbog sows among the ranks of the bugbears and hobgoblins in the host.": "当马格鲁比耶特征服了地精之神时，他打算只留下胡戈尔巴耶格一个人活着，作为一个严厉的监督者，将地精控制在脚下。但地精的神殿里有一个诡计多端的神，他决心要笑到最后。虽然它的本质被马格鲁比耶击碎了，但这个诡计多端的神以分裂的形式存活下来，当地精形成一个宿主时，它就会出现，除非它被安抚，否则会造成队伍的混乱。妖精们没有这个神的名字，也不敢给它起名字，以免马格卢比耶特用它的名字来迷惑和压制它，就像他对其他神灵一样。他们把附身的灵魂和被它附身的妖精称为nilbog（\"妖精 \"倒过来拼），他们陶醉于nilbog在主人的虫人和妖精队伍中播下的恐惧。",
	" When goblinoids form a host, there is a chance that a goblin will become possessed by a nilbog, particularly if the goblin has been mistreated by its betters. This possession turns the goblin into a wisecracking, impish creature fearless of reprisal. It gives the goblin strange powers that drive others to do the opposite of what they desire. Attacking a goblin possessed by a nilbog is foolhardy, and killing the creature just prompts the spirit to possess another goblin. The only way to keep a nilbog from wreaking havoc is to treat it well and give it respect and praise.": " 当地精形成一个宿主时，地精有可能会被尼尔博格附身，特别是当地精被它的主人虐待时。这种附身使地精变成了一个爱说俏皮话、无赖的生物，不怕报复。它赋予妖精奇怪的力量，驱使他人去做与他们愿望相反的事情。攻击一个被尼尔博格附身的妖精是愚蠢的，杀死这个生物只会促使灵魂附身到另一个妖精身上。让尼尔博格不造成破坏的唯一方法是善待它，给予它尊重和赞美。",
	" The possible presence of a nilbog in a host has given rise to a practice among goblinoids that each host include at least one goblin jester. This jester is allowed to go anywhere and do whatever it pleases. The position of jester is a much sought-after one among the goblins, because even if the jester is obviously not a nilbog, hobgoblins and bugbears indulge its manic behavior.": " 宿主中可能存在一个尼尔博格，这在哥布林人中引起了一个惯例，即每个宿主至少包括一个哥布林小丑。这个小丑可以去任何地方，做任何它喜欢的事情。在地精中，小丑的位置是一个非常抢手的位置，因为即使小丑显然不是尼尔博格，霍布林和虫人也会放纵它的狂躁行为。",
	"A nilbog is an invisible spirit that possesses only goblins. Bereft of a host, the spirit has a flying speed of 30 feet and can't speak or be attacked. The only action it can take is to attempt to possess a goblin within 5 feet of it.": "尼尔博格是一种无形的精神，只附身于地精。由于没有宿主，它的飞行速度为30英尺，不能说话也不能被攻击。它唯一可以采取的行动是试图附身在它5英尺范围内的妖精。",
	"A goblin targeted by the spirit must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become possessed. While possessed by the spirit, the goblin's alignment becomes chaotic evil, its Charisma becomes 15 (unless it was already higher), and it gains the nilbog's Innate Spellcasting and Nilbogism traits, as well as its Reversal of Fortune reaction. If the save succeeds, the spirit can't possess that goblin for 24 hours. If its host is killed or the possession is ended by a spell such as hallow, magic circle, or protection from evil and good, the spirit searches for another goblin to possess. The spirit can leave its host at any time, but it won't do so willingly unless it knows there's another potential host nearby. A goblin stripped of its nilbog spirit reverts to its normal statistics and loses the traits it gained while possessed.": "被鬼魂锁定的地精必须在DC15的魅力投掷中获得成功，否则就会被附身。在被鬼魂附身的时候，地精的方向变成混乱的邪恶，它的魅力变成15（除非它本来就更高），并获得尼尔博格的先天法术和尼尔博格的特性，以及它的命运逆转反应。如果救赎成功，该灵魂在24小时内不能附身于该地精。如果它的宿主被杀，或者被一个咒语结束了附身，比如 \"神圣\"、\"魔法阵 \"或 \"避邪 \"和 \"善\"，那么这个灵魂就会寻找另一个妖精来附身。灵魂可以在任何时候离开它的宿主，但它不会自愿这么做，除非它知道附近有另一个潜在的宿主。被剥夺了尼尔博格精神的地精会恢复到正常的统计数字，并失去它在被附身时获得的特性。",

The aurochs is described in appendix A. The tanarukk is described below.": "此外，兽人与两种有时会出现在他们身边的生物有着特殊的关系：一种是大公牛，作为崇尚巴格鲁的战士的坐骑；另一种是塔纳鲁克，一种恶魔与兽人的杂交品种，它是如此堕落和具有破坏性，甚至兽人都想杀死它。附录A中描述了欧罗巴的情况。塔纳鲁克的描述见下文。",

From the moment it awakens, a redcap desires only murder and carnage, and it sets out to satisfy these cravings.": " 在翡冷翠，或者在那个平面与世界接触的翡冷翠十字路口，如果一个有生命的生物出于强烈的流血欲望，一个或多个红帽可能会出现在被杀的人的血液浸透地面的地方。起初，新的红帽看起来就像刚从土壤中挤出来的带血的小蘑菇。当月光照在其中一个帽子上时，一个看起来像枯瘦的、身材矮小的地精，驼着背，有筋骨的生物从土里跳出来。这个生物戴着一顶尖尖的皮帽，穿着类似材料的裤子，穿着沉重的铁靴，还有一把沉重的带刃武器。从它醒来的那一刻起，红帽只渴望谋杀和屠杀，它开始满足这些渴望。",
	"Redcaps lack subtlety. They live for direct confrontation and the mayhem of mortal combat. Even if a redcap wanted to be stealthy, its iron boots force it to take ponderous, thunderous steps. When a redcap is near to potential prey, though, it can close the distance quickly and get in a vicious swing of its weapon before the target can react.": "红帽子缺乏微妙性。它们为直接对抗和致命战斗的混乱而活。即使红帽想隐身，它的铁靴也迫使它采取深思熟虑的、雷鸣般的步伐。不过，当红帽接近潜在的猎物时，它可以迅速拉近距离，在目标做出反应之前，狠狠地挥动它的武器。",
	"Also, some redcaps can sense the being whose murderous acts led to their birth. A redcap might use this innate connection to find its creator and make that creature its first victim. Others seek out their maker to enjoy proximity to a kindred spirit. An individual responsible for the creation of multiple redcaps at the same site could attract the entire group to serve as cohorts, emulating that creature's murderous handiwork.": "此外，一些红帽可以感知导致其诞生的谋杀行为的存在。红帽可能会利用这种与生俱来的联系来找到它的创造者，并让那个生物成为它的第一个受害者。其他人则寻找他们的创造者，以享受与同类精神的亲近。一个负责在同一地点创造多个红帽的人可以吸引整个群体作为同伙，模仿那个生物的谋杀行为。",
	"In any case, if a redcap works with another being, the redcap demands to be paid in victims. A patron who tries to stifle a redcap's natural and necessary urge for blood risks becoming the redcap's next target.": "在任何情况下，如果一个红帽与另一个生命一起工作，红帽要求以受害者的身份得到报酬。试图扼杀红帽对血的自然和必要的冲动的赞助人有可能成为红帽的下一个目标。",
	"As subtle as a flung battleaxe.": "就像甩出的战斧一样微妙。",
	" To sustain its unnatural existence, a redcap has to soak its hat in the fresh blood of its victims. When a redcap is born, its hat is coated with wet blood, and it knows that if the blood isn't replenished at least once every three days, the redcap vanishes as if it had never been. A redcap's desire to slay is rooted in its will to survive.": " 为了维持其非自然的存在，红帽必须将其帽子浸泡在受害者的鲜血中。当红帽出生时，它的帽子上涂满了湿润的血液，它知道如果每三天不补充一次血液，红帽就会消失，就像它从未出现过一样。红帽的杀戮欲望植根于它的生存意志。",
	" Redcaps don't usually operate in groups, but in some circumstances they might be fond in the employ of hags and dark mages that know methods to call redcaps out of the Feywild and put them to work as grisly servants.": " 红帽通常不会成群结队地行动，但在某些情况下，他们可能喜欢受雇于女巫和黑暗法师，他们知道如何把红帽从仙境中召唤出来，让他们作为可怕的仆人工作。",
	"Many of the stories sung as sea shanties and passed on as tales in dockside taverns tell of people lost to the sea-but not merely drowned and gone. These unfortunates are taken by the ocean and live on as sea spawn, haunting the waves like tortured reflections of their former selves. Coral encrusts them. Barnacles cling to their cold skin. Lungs that once filled with air can now breathe in water as well.": "许多故事都是作为海誓山盟来唱的，在码头酒馆里作为故事流传，讲述的是人们在大海中失去的故事，但不仅仅是被淹死和消失。这些不幸的人被海洋带走，作为海中的卵子继续生存，在海浪中徘徊，就像他们以前的自我的折磨的反映。珊瑚包裹着他们。藤壶依附在他们冰冷的皮肤上。曾经充满空气的肺现在也可以在水中呼吸了。",
	"Tales provide myriad reasons for these strange transformations. \"Be wary of falling in love with a sea elf or a merfolk,\" some say. \"Return to port before a storm, no matter how tempting the catch.\" \"Honor the sea gods as they demand, but never promise them your heart.\" Such cautionary tales disguise the deeper truth: things lurk beneath the waves that strive to claim the hearts and minds of land dwellers.": "传说为这些奇怪的转变提供了无数的理由。有人说：\"要警惕爱上一个海精灵或人鱼，\"有人说。\"在暴风雨来临之前回到港口，无论渔获多么诱人。\" \"按照海神的要求向他们致敬，但永远不要向他们承诺你的心。\" 这样的警示故事掩盖了更深层次的事实：在海浪之下潜伏着一些东西，它们努力地要求陆地居民的心和思想。",
	" Krakens, morkoths, sea hags, marids, storm giants, dragon turtles-all of these sea creatures and more can mark mortals as their own and claim them as minions. Such people might become beholden to their master through a bleak bargain, or they might find themselves cursed by such creatures. Once warped into a fishlike form, the person can't leave the sea for long without courting death.": " Krakens、Morkoths、sea hag、marids、storm giants、dragon turtles--所有这些海洋生物和更多的生物都可以将凡人标记为自己的，并要求他们成为奴仆。这些人可能会通过残酷的交易成为他们的主人，或者他们可能会发现自己被这些生物所诅咒。一旦被扭曲成鱼的形状，这个人就不能长时间离开海洋而不去追求死亡。",
	" Sea spawn come in a wide variety of forms. An individual might have a tentacle for an arm, the jaws of a shark, a sea urchin's spines, a whale's fin, octopus eyes, seaweed hair, or any combination of such qualities. Some sea spawn have piscine body parts that provide them with special abilities beyond those of an ordinary humanoid.": " 海产有各种各样的形式。一个人可能有一个触手作为手臂，鲨鱼的下巴，海胆的刺，鲸鱼的鳍，章鱼的眼睛，海藻的头发，或任何此类品质的组合。一些海产人的身体部位有鱼鳞状，使他们具有超出普通人的特殊能力。",
	"Visitors to a string of islands called the Purple Rocks (in the Forgotten Realms setting) might notice one curious fact about the islands' human inhabitants: no infants or elderly are among them. This is because babies born to the Rocklanders are cast into the sea and claimed by a kraken named Slarkrethel. The experience transforms the children into fanatics dedicated to the kraken. They return from the sea as humans, but when they reach old age, they transform into sea spawn and rejoin their master in the dark depths. Some children return having suffered partial transformations, leaving them semi-bestial until their full transformation when they reach old age. These wretches are hidden until their final change, to keep the secret of the Purple Rocks.": "来到一串被称为紫岩的岛屿（在《被遗忘的领域》中）的游客可能会注意到关于岛上人类居民的一个奇怪的事实：他们中没有婴儿或老人。这是因为洛克人所生的婴儿会被扔进海里，被一只名叫斯拉克雷特尔的海怪领走。这种经历使孩子们变成了献给海怪的狂热分子。他们从海里回来时是人类，但当他们年老时，就会变成海中的卵子，在黑暗的深处与他们的主人会合。有些孩子在回来时经历了部分转变，使他们成为半兽人，直到他们年老时完全转变。这些可怜虫被隐藏起来，直到他们的最终转变，以保持紫岩的秘密。",
	"Kraken priests (described in appendix B) are the tenders of the kraken's flock. Most of the priests are island natives, but some are merfolk, merrow, or sea elves that live in the water around the Purple Rocks.": "海怪祭司（在附录B中描述）是海怪羊群的照料者。大多数祭司是岛上的土著，但也有一些是生活在紫岩周围水域的人鱼族、人鱼族或海精灵。",
	"These black hounds of the Shadowfell move invisibly through the shadows, always on the hunt. In gloomy places where the veil between the Shadowfell and the Material Plane is thinnest, they can cross over into the dark realms of the world.": "这些阴影城的黑色猎犬在阴影中无形地移动，总是在追捕。在阴影地带和物质世界之间的面纱最薄的阴暗地方，它们可以穿越到世界的黑暗领域。",
	" Shadow mastiffs hunt in packs on the Shadowfell, so when one of them enters a rift between the planes, several more are sure to follow. Each pack is led by an alpha (male or female) that is the smartest and toughest one of the group. The alpha must remain sharp to keep the rest of the pack in line, lest it be killed and replaced.": " 暗影獒在暗影城成群结队地捕猎，所以当它们中的一个进入平面之间的裂缝时，肯定会有更多的人跟随。每个族群由一个首领（男性或女性）领导，他是族群中最聪明、最强悍的一个。首领必须保持敏锐，让族群的其他成员保持一致，否则就会被杀死和取代。",
	"When a shadow mastiff pack is hungry and senses prey nearby, the alpha lets loose a howl that strikes fear into the hearts of nearby beasts and humanoids. Its howl is also a signal to the rest of the pack to move in for the kill. Gloom provides a shadow mastiff with supernatural protection, granting it resistance to nonmagical weapons while in dim light or darkness. Shadow mastiffs can tolerate bright light, but they shun sunlight.": "当影獒群饿了，感觉到附近有猎物时，首领就会发出嚎叫，让附近的野兽和人类感到恐惧。它的嚎叫声也是向狼群的其他成员发出的信号，让他们进场捕杀。阴霾为影獒提供了超自然的保护，使它在昏暗的光线或黑暗中能抵抗非魔法武器的攻击。影獒可以忍受明亮的光线，但它们回避阳光。",
	" Some faiths devoted to deities of gloom and night, such as Shar in the Forgotten Realms, perform unholy rites to summon shadow mastiffs from the Shadowfell and then put them to work as temple sentinels, bodyguards, and punishers of nonbelievers, heretics, and apostates. The method for bringing shadow mastiffs into the world is also known by other strong-willed and evil-minded individuals, who find use for the hounds as guards in their strongholds.": " 一些致力于阴暗和黑夜之神的信仰，比如被遗忘的领域中的沙尔，会举行不神圣的仪式，从阴影之城召唤影子獒犬，然后让它们作为寺庙的哨兵、保镖，以及惩罚不信者、异端和叛教者的凶手。将影獒带入世界的方法也被其他意志坚强、心怀邪恶的人所熟知，他们发现这些猎犬可以作为他们据点的守卫。",
	" In addition to its other capabilities, a shadow mastiff can see creatures and objects on the Ethereal Plane. This extraplanar perception makes a mastiff an especially skilled guardian, especially in situations when magical or spiritual incursion is likely.": " 除了其他能力之外，影獒还能看到虚空界的生物和物体。这种平面外的感知能力使藏獒成为一个特别熟练的守护者，尤其是在有可能发生魔法或精神入侵的情况下。",
	"A shoosuva is a hyena-demon gifted by Yeenoghu to an especially powerful gnoll (typically as a fang of Yeenoghu). A shoosuva manifests shortly after a war band achieves a great victory, emerging from a billowing, fetid cloud of smoke as it arrives from the Abyss. In battle, the demon wraps its slavering jaws around one victim while lashing out with the poisonous stinger on its tail to bring down another one. A creature immobilized by the poison becomes easy pickings for any gnolls nearby.": "苏瓦是耶诺古赠送给一个特别强大的地精的鬣狗妖（通常作为耶诺古的獠牙）。在一个战队取得巨大胜利后不久，苏瓦就会显现出来，当它从深渊中来到这里时，会从一团翻滚的、腥臭的烟雾中出现。在战斗中，恶魔用它那贪婪的大嘴咬住一个受害者，同时用它尾巴上的毒刺将另一个受害者击倒。被毒药困住的生物很容易成为附近的地精们的猎物。",
	"Each shoosuva is bonded to a particular gnoll and fights alongside its master. A gnoll that has been gifted with a shoosuva is second only to a flind in status within a war band.": "每一个shosuva都与一个特定的地精联系在一起，并与它的主人一起战斗。在一个战队中，被赋予了shoosuva的地精在地位上仅次于弗林德。",
	"The quest for revenge sometimes leads one to undergo a ritual whereby they transform into a body of semiliquid sentience known as a slithering tracker. Innocuous and insidious at the same time, a tracker flows into places where a normal creature can't go and brings its own brand of watery death down upon its quarry.": "对复仇的追求有时会导致一个人经历一种仪式，在这种仪式中，他们会变成一个半液态的有意识的身体，被称为滑行追踪者。追踪者既无害又阴险，它可以进入普通生物无法进入的地方，并将自己的水样死亡带到猎物身上。",
	" The ritual for creating a slithering tracker is known to hags, liches, and priests who worship gods of vengeance. It can only be performed on a willing creature that hungers for revenge. The ritual sucks all the moisture from the person's body, killing it. Yet the mind lives on in the puddle of liquid that issues forth from the remains, and so too does the subject's insatiable need for retribution.": " 制造滑行追踪者的仪式为巫婆、地衣和崇拜复仇之神的牧师所熟知。它只能在一个渴望复仇的自愿生物身上进行。这个仪式吸走了这个人身体里所有的水分，使其死亡。然而他的思想却活在从遗体中流出的一滩液体中，而且他对报复的永不满足的需求也是如此。",
	" A slithering tracker tastes the ground it courses over, seeking any trace of its prey. To kill, a slithering tracker rises up and enshrouds a creature, attempting to drown the prey while also draining it of blood. A slithering tracker that has killed in this fashion becomes much easier to locate for a time, since its liquid form becomes tinged with blood and its body leaves a visible trail of the stuff behind it.": " 滑行追踪者会品尝它所经过的地面，寻找猎物的任何痕迹。杀人时，滑行追踪者会站起来，将一个生物包裹起来，试图淹死猎物，同时吸干它的血。以这种方式杀人的滑行追踪者在一段时间内会变得更容易被找到，因为它的液体形态会染上血色，而且它的身体后面会留下明显的血迹。",
	" Achieving revenge against its target doesn't end a slithering tracker's existence, nor its hunger for blood. Some slithering trackers remain aware of their purpose and extend their quest for vengeance to others, such as anyone who supported or befriended the original target. Most of the time, though, a tracker's mind can't cope with being trapped in liquid form, unable to communicate, and driven by the desire for blood: after a tracker fulfills its duty, insanity takes over the creature, and it attacks indiscriminately until it is destroyed.": " 实现对目标的报复并不能结束滑行追踪者的存在，也不能结束它对血的渴望。有些滑行追踪者仍然意识到他们的目的，并将他们的复仇追求延伸到其他人身上，例如任何支持或结交原始目标的人。但大多数时候，追踪者的头脑无法应付被困在液态中，无法沟通，并被对血的渴望所驱使：在追踪者完成其职责后，精神错乱占据了这个生物，它胡乱攻击，直到被摧毁。",
	"Kyuss was a high priest of Orcus who plundered corpses from necropolises to create the first spawn of Kyuss. Even centuries after Kyuss's death, his mad disciples continue performing the horrific rites he perfected.": "凯斯（Kyuss）是奥库斯（Orcus）的一个大祭司，他从尸库中掠夺尸体来创造凯斯的第一个卵子。即使在库斯死后几个世纪，他的疯狂弟子仍在继续执行他所完善的恐怖仪式。",
	" From a distance or in poor light, a spawn of Kyuss looks like an ordinary zombie. As it comes into clearer view, one can see scores of little green worms crawling in and out of it. These worms jump onto nearby humanoids and burrow into their flesh. A worm that penetrates a humanoid body makes its way to the creature's brain. Once inside the brain, the worm kills its host and animates the corpse, transforming it into a spawn of Kyuss that breeds more worms. The dead humanoid's soul remains trapped inside the corpse, preventing the individual from being raised or resurrected until the undead body is destroyed. The horror of being a soul imprisoned in an undead body drives a spawn of Kyuss insane.": " 从远处或在光线不足的情况下，Kyuss的卵子看起来像一个普通的僵尸。当它进入更清晰的视野时，人们可以看到几十条绿色的小虫子在里面爬进爬出。这些蠕虫跳到附近的人类身上，钻进他们的肉里。穿透人形生物身体的虫子会进入生物的大脑。一旦进入大脑，蠕虫就会杀死它的宿主，并使尸体具有生命力，将其转化为Kyuss的卵子，繁殖出更多的蠕虫。死去的人形生物的灵魂仍然被困在尸体内，在不死之身被摧毁之前，个人无法复活或被复活。灵魂被囚禁在不死之身中的恐怖感使Kyuss之卵陷入疯狂。",
	" Spawn of Kyuss are expressions of Orcus's intent to replace all life with undeath. Left to its own devices, a solitary spawn of Kyuss travels aimlessly. If it stumbles across a living creature, the spawn attacks with the sole intent of creating more spawn. Whether they are dispersed or clustered, spawn reproduce exponentially if nothing stops them.": " 奎斯（Kyuss）的卵子是奥库斯（Orcus）意图用不死之身取代所有生命的表达方式。独自一人的凯斯之卵会漫无目的地旅行。如果它偶然发现了一个活的生物，它就会攻击，唯一的目的是创造更多的产卵。无论它们是分散的还是聚集的，如果没有人阻止它们，产卵就会成倍地繁殖。",
	" Spawn of Kyuss require no air, food, drink, or sleep.": " 库斯的产卵不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",

	"The surface of the world is an alien realm to stone giants: fluctuating, temporary, exposed to gusting wind and sudden rain. It is as wildly changeable as a dream, and that's how they regard it-as a dream. Nothing there is permanent, so nothing there is real. What happens on the surface doesn't matter. Promises and bargains made there needn't be honored. Life and even art hold less value there.": "世界的表面对石巨人来说是一个陌生的领域：波动的、暂时的、暴露在阵风和骤雨中。它就像一个梦一样变化无常，他们就是这样看待它--一个梦。那里没有任何东西是永久的，所以那里没有任何东西是真实的。表面上发生的事情并不重要。在那里做出的承诺和交易不需要兑现。生命甚至艺术在那里的价值较低。",
	" Stone giants sometimes go on dream quests in the surface world, seeking inspiration for their art, to break a decades-long ennui, or out of simple curiosity.

Regardless of the reason, if they don't take shelter under stone, such individuals can become dreamwalkers.": " 石头巨人有时会在地表世界进行梦境探险，为他们的艺术寻找灵感，打破几十年来的沉闷，或者仅仅是出于好奇心。一些去做这些探索的人让自己迷失在梦中。其他石巨人则被放逐到地面作为惩罚。不管是什么原因，如果他们不在石头下避难，这样的人可以成为梦游者。",
	"Dreamwalkers occupy an odd place of respect outside of stone giant ordning. They are considered outcasts, but their familiarity with the surface world makes them valuable guides, and their insights can help other stone giants grasp the dangers of living in a dream.": "梦游者在石巨人条例之外占据了一个奇怪的尊重位置。他们被认为是被遗弃的，但他们对表面世界的熟悉使他们成为有价值的向导，他们的洞察力可以帮助其他石巨人掌握生活在梦中的危险性。",
	" Dreamwalkers are driven mad by isolation, shame, and their unendingly alien surroundings, and this madness leeches out into the world around them, affecting other creatures that get too close. Believing that they're living in a dream and that their actions have no real consequences, dreamwalkers act as they please, becoming forces of chaos. As they travel the world, they collect objects and creatures that seem especially significant in their mad minds. Over time, the collected things accrete to their bodies, becoming encased in stone.": " 梦游者被孤立、羞耻和他们无休止的陌生环境逼疯了，这种疯狂会渗入他们周围的世界，影响其他太过接近的生物。梦游者相信他们生活在梦中，他们的行为没有真正的后果，他们随心所欲地行动，成为混乱的力量。当他们环游世界时，他们收集那些在他们疯狂的头脑中似乎特别重要的物体和生物。随着时间的推移，收集到的东西会累积到他们的身体里，成为包裹在石头里的东西。",
	"To forestall the inevitable, some storm giants approaching the end of their natural life spans seek an escape from death. They plumb the depths of their powerful connection to the elements and disperse themselves into nature, literally transforming into semiconscious storms. The blizzard that rages unendingly around a mountain peak, the vortex that swirls around a remote island, or the thunderstorm that howls ceaselessly up and down a rugged coastline could, in fact, be the undying form of a storm giant clinging to existence.": "为了防止不可避免的情况发生，一些接近自然寿命终点的风暴巨人寻求逃离死亡。他们挖掘自己与元素的强大联系的深度，将自己分散到自然界中，真正变成了半意识的风暴。在一座山峰周围无休止地肆虐的暴风雪，在一个遥远的岛屿周围旋转的漩涡，或者在崎岖的海岸线上无休止地嚎叫的雷暴，事实上，可能是一个风暴巨人坚持存在的不死形态。",

	"A storm giant quintessent has no need for castles or dungeon lairs. Its lair is usually a secluded region or prominent geographic feature, such as a mountain peak, a great waterfall, a remote island, a fog-shrouded loch, a beautiful coral reef, or a windswept desert bluff. As befits the environment, the storm in which the giant lives could be a blizzard, a typhoon, a thunderstorm, or a sandstorm.": "一个风暴巨人的五脏六腑不需要城堡或地牢的巢穴。它的巢穴通常是一个僻静的地区或突出的地理特征，如一座山峰、一个大瀑布、一个遥远的岛屿、一个雾气笼罩的湖泊、一个美丽的珊瑚礁，或一个风吹草动的沙漠悬崖。与环境相称，巨人所处的风暴可能是暴风雪、台风、雷暴或沙尘暴。",

If a creature dies while infected, its corpse produces vegepygmies the same way russet mold does.": "随着vegepygmy年龄的增长，它变得更加坚韧，并在其身上长出了孢子群。含有孢子的vegepygmies会受到其他vegepygmies的尊重，所以外人把这种vegepygmies称为首领。首领可以爆发性地排出它的孢子，感染附近的生物。如果一个生物在被感染时死亡，它的尸体会像赤霉病一样产生蔬果虫。",

Another story says that explorers found russet mold in a crater left by a falling star, with vegepygmies infesting the dense jungle nearby.": "没有人知道赤霉病是怎么来的。有一个历史记载说，冒险家们在一个令人望而却步的山脉中发现了赤霉菌，并在一个充满奇特生命的金属地牢中发现了vegepygmies。另一个故事说，探险家们在一颗坠落的恒星留下的陨石坑中发现了赤霉菌，附近的茂密丛林中则有维格米人出没。",
	" Vegepygmies originate from the remains left behind when a humanoid or a giant is killed by russet mold. One or more vegepygmies emerge from the corpse a day later. If a beast such as a dog or a bear dies from russet mold, the result is a bestial moldie called a thorny result instead of a humanoid-shaped vegepygmy. Thornies are less intelligent than vegepygmies, but have greater size and ferocity, as well as a thorn-covered body.": " 维格米人起源于人形生物或巨人被赤霉菌杀死后留下的残骸。一天后，一个或多个素食者从尸体中出现。如果狗或熊等野兽死于赤霉病，其结果是一个被称为荆棘的兽性霉菌，而不是一个人形的vegepygmy。荆棘人的智力低于素食者，但有更大的体型和凶猛，以及被荆棘覆盖的身体。",
	"The fungus known as russet mold is reddish-brown in color and found only in places that are dark, warm, and wet. Russet mold that spreads out across a metal object can be mistaken for natural rust, and a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) or Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check is required to identify it accurately by sight in such a case.": "被称为赤褐色霉菌的真菌呈红褐色，只在黑暗、温暖和潮湿的地方发现。遍布金属物体的赤褐色霉菌会被误认为是天然的铁锈，在这种情况下，需要通过DC15智力（{@skill Nature}）或智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查来准确识别它。",
	"Russet mold can be hard to kill, since weapons and most types of damage do it no harm. Effects that deal acid, necrotic, or radiant damage kill 1 square foot of russet mold per 1 damage dealt. A pound of salt, a gallon of alcohol, or a magical effect that cures disease kills russet mold in a square area that is 10 feet on a side. Sunlight kills any russet mold in the light's area.": "赤霉病是很难杀死的，因为武器和大多数类型的伤害对它没有任何伤害。造成酸、坏死或辐射伤害的效果每造成1次伤害就会杀死1平方英尺的赤霉菌。一磅盐、一加仑酒精或治疗疾病的魔法效果可以杀死边长为10英尺的方形区域内的赤霉菌。阳光可以杀死光照范围内的任何赤霉菌。",
	"Tlincallis, also called scorpion folk, are chitin-covered creatures, humanoid from the waist up with the lower body of an enormous scorpion, complete with a stinger at the end of a long tail.": "Tlincallis，也被称为蝎子民，是一种被甲壳素覆盖的生物，从腰部往上是人形，下半身是巨大的蝎子，在长尾巴的末端有一根刺。",
	" Tlincallis live austerely. They range across arid lands, hunting at dawn and dusk. In the hours between, they wait out the day's heat or the night's cold by burying themselves in loose sand or earth or, if the terrain proves too inflexible, lurking in ruins or shallow caves. A tribe of tlincallis stays in one place for only as long as the hunting is good in the immediate area, though they might visit the same way stations over and over during their wanderings. The tribe also settles down temporarily whenever it's time to lay eggs and hatch a new brood of young.": " Tlincallis的生活很简朴。它们在干旱的土地上奔跑，在黎明和黄昏时分捕猎。在这之间的时间里，他们把自己埋在松散的沙子或泥土里，等待白天的炎热或夜晚的寒冷，如果地形证明太不灵活，就潜伏在废墟或浅洞里。只要附近地区的狩猎情况良好，特林卡利斯部落就会一直呆在一个地方，尽管他们在流浪过程中可能会反复访问同一个站点。每当到了产卵和孵化新一窝幼崽的时候，部落也会暂时定居下来。",
	" Tlincallis deposit their eggs in warm places out of direct sunlight, often amid a stand of cacti near their present encampment. There the eggs lie protected by hard shells coated in paralytic poison similar to that produced by their stingers. A would-be predator that dares to break an egg is defenseless against the tlincallis that come to investigate.": " Tlincallis将它们的卵存放在温暖的地方，避免阳光直射，通常是在它们现在的营地附近的仙人掌林中。在那里，卵被涂有麻痹性毒药的硬壳保护着，这种毒药与它们的毒刺所产生的毒药相似。敢于打破蛋的潜在捕食者对前来调查的Tlincallis毫无抵抗力。",
	" Tlincallis eat what they kill, but they also take some of their prey alive when they have new mouths to feed. After using their stingers to paralyze victims and their spiked chains to bind them, tlincallis take these prisoners back to their encampment and tie them to cactus or rock formations. There, victims wait until the sun sets and the newly hatched young emerge from the lair to eat them alive.": " Tlincallis吃它们杀死的东西，但当它们有新的嘴要喂时，它们也会活捉一些猎物。在用它们的毒刺麻痹受害者，用它们的带刺铁链捆绑他们之后，Tlincallis将这些囚犯带回它们的营地，并将他们绑在仙人掌或岩石上。在那里，受害者一直等到太阳落山，新孵化的幼虫从巢穴里出来，把他们活活吃掉。",
	" Tlincallis see themselves as great hunters. If a tlincalli tribe encounters a more powerful hunter, such as a blue dragon, the tribe's leader must decide whether the group becomes obedient to the superior hunter, moves on, or fights to the death to defeat it.": " 特林卡利人认为自己是伟大的猎手。如果一个特林卡利部落遇到一个更强大的猎人，如蓝龙，该部落的首领必须决定该群体是顺从于高级猎人，继续前进，还是拼死打败它。",
	" Tlincallis are uncivilized and don't build cities, make clothing, or mine metals. Instead, they scavenge what they need or want. They do, however, know how to melt down scavenged metal to forge crude weapons and tools.": " 特林卡利斯是未开化的，不建造城市，不制造衣服，也不开采金属。相反，他们捡拾他们需要或想要的东西。然而，他们确实知道如何熔化捡来的金属来锻造粗糙的武器和工具。",
	"Transmuters are specialist wizards who embrace change, rail against the status quo, and view magical transmutation as a path to riches, enlightenment, or apotheosis.": "转化者是拥抱变化、反对现状的专业魔法师，并将魔法转化视为通往财富、启蒙或神化的道路。",
	"A trapper is a manta-like creature that lurks in subterranean and natural environments. It can change the color and texture of its tough, outward-facing side to help it blend in with its surroundings, while its soft, inward-facing side clings to the floor, wall, or ceiling in its hunting territory. It remains motionless as it waits for prey to come close. When a target is within its reach, it peels itself away from the surface and wraps around its prey, crushing, smothering, and then digesting it.": "捕猎者是一种类似蝠鲼的生物，潜伏在地下和自然环境中。它可以改变其坚韧的、朝外的一面的颜色和质地，以帮助它与周围环境融为一体，而其柔软的、朝内的一面则依附在其狩猎区的地板、墙壁或天花板上。当它等待猎物靠近时，它保持不动。当目标在它触手可及的范围内时，它就把自己从表面剥离出来，包裹住猎物，将其压碎、闷死，然后消化掉。",
	" A trapper can alter the color and texture of its outer side to match its surroundings. It can blend in with any surface made of stone, earth, or wood, masking its presence to any but the most rigorous scrutiny. It can't change its texture to that of a grassy or snow-covered surface, but it can change its color to match and then conceal itself under a thin layer of vegetation or actual snow.": " 捕兽器可以改变其外侧的颜色和纹理，以配合其周围的环境。它可以与任何由石头、泥土或木材制成的表面融为一体，除了最严格的审查外，还可以掩盖其存在。它不能把自己的质地改变成草或雪覆盖的表面，但它可以改变自己的颜色，然后把自己隐藏在一层薄薄的植物或实际的雪下。",
	"Trappers know when prey draws near, so explore ruins and dungeons with equal wariness. For dumb beasts, they know very well what treasure is, what treasure chests are, and how these lure the likes of us.": "捕猎者知道猎物何时靠近，所以以同样的戒心探索废墟和地牢。对于愚蠢的野兽来说，他们非常清楚什么是宝藏，什么是宝箱，以及这些宝箱如何引诱我们这些人。",
	" A trapper needs to eat about a halfling-sized meal once a week to remain sated. It is content to stay in one place, given a steady supply of food, and thus trappers are a threat along any well-traveled dungeon corridor and on routes through the wilderness that see a lot of traffic. When prey is scarce, a trapper enters a state of hibernation that can last for months, though it is still aware when prey comes near. A trapper on the verge of starvation might defy its instincts and begin creeping along, abandoning its old territory in search of better hunting.": " 一个捕猎者每周需要吃一次半灵大小的食物才能保持饱腹感。只要有稳定的食物供应，它就会满足于呆在一个地方，因此，在任何交通便利的地牢走廊和穿越荒野的路线上，捕猎者都是一种威胁。当猎物稀少时，捕猎者会进入冬眠状态，这种状态可以持续数月，尽管当猎物靠近时它仍会有所察觉。濒临饿死的捕兽人可能会不顾自己的本能，开始匍匐前进，放弃原来的领地去寻找更好的猎物。",
	" When its prey is dead, a trapper dissolves and absorbs the fleshy parts, leaving a scattering of bones, metal, treasure, and other indigestible bits in the place where the creature had been. A trapper that lurks on the floor of its hunting grounds can cover these remains with own body, making them look like irregularities in the surface. The creature might also attach itself to a wall or a ceiling close to a recent kill, effectively using the remnants as bait: a creature that stops to investigate the bones for valuables stands a good chance of becoming the trapper's next meal.": " 当它的猎物死后，捕猎者会溶解并吸收肉体部分，在生物曾经呆过的地方留下散落的骨头、金属、财宝和其他难以消化的碎片。潜伏在狩猎场地上的捕兽者可以用自己的身体覆盖这些残骸，使它们看起来像表面的不规则。这种生物还可能把自己附在靠近最近杀戮的墙壁或天花板上，有效地利用这些残骸作为诱饵：停下来调查骨头上的贵重物品的生物很有可能成为捕猎者的下一顿饭。",
	"Very rarely, a tadpole from an elder brain's brine pool transforms an individual into an ulitharid, a larger and more potent mind flayer that boasts six tentacles.": "极少数情况下，来自长者大脑盐水池的蝌蚪会将一个人转化为乌利萨里德，一种更大、更有力的心灵传播者，拥有六条触手。",
	" Illithids innately recognize that an ulitharid's survival is more important than their own. An elder brain's reaction to the rise of an ulitharid varies. In most colonies, the ulitharid becomes an elder brain's most favored servant, invested with power and authority. In others, the elder brain perceives an ulitharid as a potential rival for power, and it manipulates or quashes the ulitharid's ambitions accordingly.": " 伊利特人天生就认识到，一个乌利特人的生存比他们自己的生存更重要。长老会对ulitharid的崛起的反应各不相同。在大多数殖民地，ulitharid成为长老会最宠爱的仆人，被赋予了权力和权威。在其他情况下，长老会认为ulitharid是一个潜在的权力对手，并相应地操纵或压制ulitharid的野心。",
	" When an ulitharid finds sharing leadership with an elder brain to be insufferable, it breaks off from the colony, taking a group of mind flayers with it, and moves to another location to form a new colony. After the death of the ulitharid's body, mind flayers take its brain and place it in a brine pool, where it grows into an elder brain over a few days. This process doesn't work on the brain of an ulitharid that dies a natural death, as a brain that succumbs to old age is too decrepit to be used in the creation of an elder brain.": " 当ulitharid发现与一个长老的大脑分享领导权是难以忍受的，它就会从群体中脱离出来，带着一群思想传播者，移动到另一个地方，形成一个新的群体。Ulitharid的身体死亡后，思想传播者会把它的大脑放在盐水池中，几天后它就会成长为一个长老大脑。这个过程对自然死亡的乌利塔里德人的大脑不起作用，因为因年老而屈服的大脑太过衰弱，无法用于创造一个长者大脑。",
	" Each ulitharid carries a psionically enhanced staff made of black metal. When the ulitharid is ready to give up its life, it attaches the staff to the back of its head, and the staff cracks open its skull and peels it apart, enabling its brain to be extracted. The brain and the staff are then planted in the ulitharid's corpse, causing it to dissolve into ichor. This psionically potent slime helps to fuel the transformation of the area into a brine pool that surrounds an embryonic elder brain.": " 每个ulitharid都携带一根由黑色金属制成的幻觉增强的法杖。当ulitharid准备放弃它的生命时，它将法杖固定在它的后脑勺上，法杖会裂开它的头骨并将它剥开，使它的大脑能够被提取出来。然后将大脑和法杖植入乌利塔里德的尸体中，使其溶化成ichor。这种具有幻觉效力的粘液有助于推动该地区转变为一个围绕着长老大脑胚胎的盐水池。",
	"Shrieking, flapping, and hideous to behold-with a body like a severed head and bat-like wings in place of ears—vargouilles boil out of the Abyss to infest other planes of existence, such as Carceri, where they are a menace. Each vargouille carries a disease that creates more of its kind; a flock of vargouilles on the wing is a plague of chaos and evil waiting to happen.": "尖叫着，拍打着，面目狰狞--身体像被砍掉的头颅，蝙蝠般的翅膀代替了耳朵--马犼兽从深渊中沸腾出来，侵袭其他存在的星球，比如卡塞里，它们是一种威胁。每只马犼兽都携带一种疾病，可以创造出更多的同类；一群马犼兽展翅高飞，是一场等待发生的混乱和邪恶的瘟疫。",
	" Swarms of vargouilles flap through the caverns and skies of the Abyss. They are given little regard by powerful and intelligent demons since vargouilles can do them no harm. Even the weakest demon, such as a manes or a dretch, fears vargouilles only if they appear in great numbers. In the Lower Planes, vargouilles rarely get the chance to eat live prey other than vermin. More often, they lap up the ichor left behind when one fiend kills another.": " 成群的马古拉斯在深渊的洞穴和天空中飞舞。强大而聪明的恶魔对它们不屑一顾，因为马古拉斯不能对它们造成任何伤害。即使是最弱小的恶魔，如鬃毛或德雷克，也只有在它们大量出现时才会惧怕马古拉斯。在下层世界，除了害虫之外，马犼兽很少有机会吃活的猎物。更多的时候，它们会舔食一个恶魔杀死另一个恶魔时留下的汁液。",
	"The kiss of a vargouille infects a humanoid with a fiendish curse. If allowed to run its course, the curse brings about a gruesome transformation as an abyssal spirit invades the person's body. Over a period of hours, the victim's head takes on fiendish aspects such as fangs, tentacles, and horns. At the same time, the person's ears grow larger, expanding and transforming into wing-like appendages. In the final moments, the victim's head tears away from the body in a fountain of blood, becoming another vargouille, which often then eagerly laps up its own life fluids. Sunlight or the brilliant illumination of a {@spell daylight} spell can delay this transformation, and vargouilles instinctively shun bright light as a result.": "恶魔之吻使一个人感染了可怕的诅咒。如果任其发展下去，诅咒会带来可怕的转变，因为深渊的灵魂会侵入这个人的身体。在几个小时内，受害者的头部会出现恶魔的特征，如獠牙、触角和角。同时，这个人的耳朵变大，扩大并转化为翅膀状的附属物。在最后的时刻，受害者的头在血泉中从身体上撕扯下来，成为另一个伏尔加人，然后经常急切地舔食自己的生命液体。阳光或{@spell daylight}法术的明亮照明可以延迟这种转变，因此马犼兽本能地回避亮光。",
	" Because of their instinctive hunger for living prey, vargouilles are eager to escape the Lower Planes. On rare occasions, the summoning of a demon to another plane can bring a vargouille along for the ride, attaching itself like a tick. The precautions a mortal takes to contain and control a summoned demon rarely account for a stowaway, and thus a vargouille enters the world unbidden.": " 由于它们对活生生的猎物有着本能的饥渴，马古拉斯急于逃离下层世界。在极少数情况下，一个恶魔被召唤到另一个位面时，会把马古拉斯带上，像虱子一样附着在上面。凡人为控制召唤的恶魔所采取的预防措施，很少会考虑到偷渡者，因此，马犼兽会不请自来地进入这个世界。",
	" Vargouilles that roam free on the Material Plane are a dire threat to all creatures, especially humanoids. Their awful shrieking can paralyze other creatures with fear, and such victims are helpless to resist a vargouille's accursed kiss.": " 在物质世界自由游荡的瓦古里对所有生物都是一个可怕的威胁，尤其是人类。他们可怕的尖叫声可以使其他生物因恐惧而瘫痪，而这样的受害者也无力抵御瓦古里的诅咒之吻。",
	"This feathered dinosaur is about the size of a large turkey. It is an aggressive predator and often hunts in packs to bring down larger prey.": "这种有羽毛的恐龙大约有一只大火鸡那么大。它是一种好斗的捕食者，经常成群结队地捕食，以打倒较大的猎物。",
	"War priests worship deities of war and combat. They plan tactics, lead soldiers into battle, confront enemy spellcasters, and tend to casualties. A war priest might command an army or serve as a warlord's right hand on the battlefield.": "战争祭司崇拜战争和战斗的神灵。他们计划战术，带领士兵作战，与敌人的施法者对抗，并照顾伤亡人员。战神可能会指挥军队或在战场上充当军阀的左右手。",
	"Warlocks of the archfey gain their powers through magical pacts forged with lords of the Feywild.

	"Warlocks of the fiend gain their powers through magical pacts forged with archfiends of the Lower Planes. These warlocks often keep imps or quasits as companions, and they tend toward extremes of behavior: consorting with fiend-worshiping cultists or dedicating their lives to destroying fiendish cults.": "恶魔术士通过与下层世界的大恶魔签订魔法契约来获得他们的力量。这些术士通常会把小恶魔或类人猿作为同伴，他们的行为趋于极端：与崇拜恶魔的邪教徒交往，或者把自己的生命献给毁灭恶魔的邪教。",
	"Warlocks of the Great Old One gain their powers through magical pacts forged with eldritch entities from strange and distant realms of existence. Some of these warlocks associate with cultists devoted to these entities, as well as aberrations that share their goals, yet other warlocks of the Great Old One are experts at rooting out the insanity and wickedness inspired by bizarre beings from beyond the stars.": "伟大的老一派术士通过与来自陌生而遥远的存在领域的长生实体缔结魔法契约来获得他们的力量。其中一些术士与致力于这些实体的邪教徒以及与他们目标相同的反常者有联系，然而其他伟大的老一派术士则是根除来自星际之外的怪异生物所激发的疯狂和邪恶的专家。",

	"A wood woad is a powerful plant in humanoid form invested with the soul of someone who gave up life to become an eternal guardian.": "木棉是一种强大的植物，呈人形，投入了一个放弃生命成为永恒守护者的灵魂。",
	" The ritual to create a wood woad is a primeval secret passed down through generations of savage societies and dark druid circles. Performing the ritual isn't necessarily an act of evil, if the victim-to-be has entered into a bargain that requires it to be a willing sacrifice.": " 制造木棉的仪式是野蛮社会和黑暗德鲁伊圈子里世代相传的原始秘密。执行这个仪式不一定是邪恶的行为，如果准受害者已经达成交易，要求它成为一个自愿的牺牲品。",
	"In the ritual a living person's chest is pierced and the heart removed. A seed is then pushed into the heart, and it is placed in a tree. Any hollow or crook will do, but often a special cavity is carved out of the trunk. The tree is then bathed and watered with the blood of the sacrificed victim, and the body is buried among the tree's roots. After three days, a sprout emerges from the ground at the base of the tree and swiftly grows into a humanoid form.": "在这个仪式中，一个活人的胸部被刺穿，心脏被取出。然后将一粒种子推入心脏，并将其置于一棵树上。任何中空或弯曲的地方都可以，但通常在树干上刻出一个特殊的空洞。然后用牺牲者的血给树洗澡和浇水，并将尸体埋在树的根部。三天后，树底的地面上会冒出一个新芽，并迅速长成一个人形。",
	"This new body, armored in tough bark and bearing a gnarled club and shield, is at once ready to perform its duty.

	"Wood woads are drawn to creatures that have close ties to nature, and that protect and respect the land, such as druids and treants. Some treants have wood woad servants by virtue of age-old pacts with druids or fey that performed the rituals, while others acquire the services of freed wood woads that find renewed purpose in the domain of a kindred guardian.": "木头人被那些与自然有密切联系的生物所吸引，他们保护和尊重土地，例如德鲁伊和树人。一些树人凭借与德鲁伊或执行仪式的费伊的古老契约而拥有木棉的仆人，而其他树人则获得被释放的木棉的服务，这些木棉在同类守护者的领域中找到新的目标。",
	" A wood woad has a hole where its heart would be, just as does the body of its former self, buried in the earth. Those who become wood woads trade their free will and all sense of sentiment for supernatural strength and a deathless duty. They exist only to protect woodlands and the people who tend them. A wood woad's face is void and expressionless, except for the motes of light that swim about in its eye sockets. Wood woads speak little, and when not being called upon to take action, they root themselves in the earth and silently take sustenance from it.": " 木头人的心脏有一个洞，就像它以前的身体一样，被埋在土里。那些成为木棉的人用他们的自由意志和所有的情感来换取超自然的力量和无死亡的责任。他们的存在只是为了保护林地和照料它们的人。除了在眼窝里游动的光斑，木棉的脸是空洞的，没有表情的。木耳很少说话，当不被要求采取行动时，它们就扎根于大地，默默地从大地中获取养分。",
	" Like a tree, a wood woad needs only sunlight, air, and nutrients from the earth to go on living. Because they are undying, some wood woads outlive their original purpose. The site a wood woad guards might lose its power or significance over time, or those whom it was assigned to guard might themselves die. If it is freed from its specific duties, a wood woad might roam to find another place of natural beauty or fey influence to watch over.": " 就像一棵树，木棉只需要阳光、空气和来自地球的养分就能继续生存。因为它们是不死的，所以有些木棉的寿命超过了它们最初的目的。随着时间的推移，木棉所守护的地方可能会失去其力量或意义，或者它被指派守护的人可能会自己死亡。如果它摆脱了特定的职责，木头人可能会去寻找另一个有自然美景或精灵影响的地方来守护。",

One of the treasures he stole was the Infinity Spindle, a crystalline shard from the early days of the multiverse that could transform even a creature as low as Raxivort into a demigod.": " 所有的xvarts都是一个叫Raxivort的实体的堕落的后代，他曾经作为财务主管为黑暗王子Graz'zt服务。Raxivort花了漫长的几个世纪看管国库，随着时间的推移，他开始贪恋他主人的财富。在一次大胆的行动中，他掠夺了一个宝库并逃到了物质世界。他偷的宝物之一是无限纺锤，一个来自多元宇宙早期的晶体碎片，甚至可以将像拉克西沃特这样低等的生物变成半神。",
	"After he ascended to godhood, Raxivort forged a realm called the Black Sewers, within Pandesmos, the topmost layer of Pandemonium. He enjoyed his divine ascension only briefly, though, before Graz'zt unleashed his vengeance. The demon prince had no need to regain the Infinity Spindle, since he already possessed power greater than what it could grant. Instead, he dispatched agents far and wide to spread news of what the spindle could do and the puny, pathetic creature that claimed its ownership. Soon enough, Raxivort was pursued by a variety of enemies, all eager to claim the Spindle as their own.": "在他成神之后，拉克西沃特在潘德摩斯的最顶层建立了一个名为 \"黑色下水道 \"的境界，这就是潘德摩斯。但他只是短暂地享受了他的神性升华，在格拉兹兹特释放出他的复仇之前。恶魔王子没有必要重新获得无限纺锤，因为他已经拥有了比它所能赋予的更大的力量。相反，他派遣特工到很远的地方去传播关于这个锭子能做什么的消息，以及声称拥有它的那个弱小、可怜的生物。很快，拉克西沃特就被各种敌人追捕，他们都渴望将转轴据为己有。",

When things aren't going well for them, xvarts naturally assume that Raxivort is angry. To appease their troubled lord, they stage kidnappings. They fashion nets to capture their enemies, which are dragged back to the lair and sacrificed on a makeshift altar. Raxivort can hear their supplications, but he's too afraid to come out of hiding most of the time. Occasionally, he does appear before a tribe of worshipers as a 9-foot-tall xvart carrying an empty sack. In every such instance, Raxivort takes all of the treasure that the tribe has accumulated, stuffs it in his sack, and disappears, leaving nothing behind as compensation.": "尽管他们生性糊涂，但所有的xvarts都对Raxivort有着不可动摇的奉献精神。取悦拉西沃特的愿望在他们所有的决定中占了很大比重。当事情进展不顺利时，Xvarts自然会认为Raxivort在生气。为了安抚他们麻烦的主人，他们策划了绑架事件。他们用网来捕捉敌人，然后把他们拖回巢穴，在一个临时的祭坛上献祭。拉克西沃特能听到他们的祈祷，但他在大多数时候都不敢出来。偶尔，他也会出现在崇拜者的部落面前，变成一个9英尺高的Xvart，拿着一个空袋子。在每一个这样的例子中，Raxivort都会拿走部落所积累的所有财宝，把它们塞进他的麻袋里，然后消失，不留下任何补偿。",

They are greedy, conniving, and obsessed with the acquisition of valuables-the more ornate or bizarre, the better. They know they are flawed, and this minor amount of self-awareness only magnifies their other deficiencies . They hate almost any creature they perceive as better than they are, which includes almost anyone, but they lack the courage or wherewithal to act on their hatred most of the time. Their fear has led them to dwell either in gloomy places on the far fringes of civilized lands or in areas neglected or forgotten by mightier creatures. In other words, xvarts usually live in places where normal vermin might flourish.": " Xvarts拥有他们的创造者的所有缺陷，但几乎没有值得称道的品质。他们缺乏繁殖的物理设备，也没有这样做的倾向。他们贪婪、阴险，痴迷于获取贵重物品--越华丽或越怪异越好。他们知道自己是有缺陷的，而这种少量的自我意识只会放大他们的其他缺陷。他们几乎憎恨任何他们认为比他们好的生物，这几乎包括任何人，但他们在大多数时候缺乏勇气或资金来采取行动来表达他们的憎恨。他们的恐惧使他们要么居住在文明土地的遥远边缘的阴暗地方，要么居住在被更强大的生物忽视或遗忘的地区。换句话说，Xvarts通常生活在正常的害虫可能繁衍的地方。",
	" Rats and bats (including giant-sized specimens) are naturally attracted to xvarts, and xvarts domesticate such beasts for food and battle. Xvarts also form alliances with wererats, although the lycanthropes are dominant in any such arrangement. This relationship traces back to Raxivort's divine nature. Even though the xvarts inherited Raxivort's greed and cowardice, they also gained his ability to form bonds with such creatures.": " 老鼠和蝙蝠（包括巨大的标本）自然会被Xvarts吸引，Xvarts驯化这些野兽作为食物和战斗。Xvarts也与狼人结成联盟，尽管狼人在任何这样的安排中都是占主导地位的。这种关系可以追溯到Raxivort的神性。尽管Xvarts继承了Raxivort的贪婪和懦弱，但他们也获得了他与这种生物形成联系的能力。",
	" A xvart can forge a pact with Raxivort by stealing an item of such great value that the demigod himself appears before the xvart to claim it. After surrendering the item to Raxivort, the xvart asks for magical power so that it can find and deliver more great treasures into Raxivort's custody. If the demigod feels so inclined, he imbues the xvart with greater wisdom and charisma and grants it the spellcasting abilities of a warlock before returning to the howling chaos of": " xvart可以通过偷窃一件价值连城的物品，让半神亲自出现在xvart面前，从而与Raxivort达成协议。在将物品交给Raxivort后，xvart要求获得魔法力量，这样它就能找到并将更多的巨大宝藏送到Raxivort的手中。如果半神觉得有必要，他就会给xvart灌输更多的智慧和魅力，并赋予它术士的法术能力，然后再回到嚎叫的混乱中去。",

They scour the wilderness, old ruins, and dungeons for treasures, often with a handful of xvart sycophants and giant rat bodyguards in tow.": " Raxivort的术士们在xvart社会中受到尊重和敬畏，但他们对政治权力没有兴趣。他们在荒野、古老的遗迹和地牢中搜寻宝藏，经常带着少数xvart的佞臣和巨鼠保镖。",

Only the threat of dawn drives the pack back into hiding.": "猎犬是由强大的精灵授予那些取悦他们的人，它们像猎狗一样为邪恶的主人服务。耶斯猎犬飞快地追赶它们的猎物，常常等到猎物精疲力竭而无法反击。只有在黎明的威胁下，猎狗群才会重新躲藏起来。",
	" A pack of yeth hounds can be created by powerful fey such as the Queen of Air and Darkness. Once it is brought into existence, a pack must have a master, who is often someone the creator wishes to reward.

	"A yeth hound stands about 5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs around 400 pounds. Often all that can be seen of one in the darkness is the red glow of its eyes against its night-black fur. The head of a yeth hound has a human-like face, held up by a neck more flexible than a dog's. The creature gives off an odor like smoke.": "耶斯猎犬肩高约5英尺，体重约400磅。在黑暗中，往往只能看到它的眼睛在夜黑的皮毛下发出红色的光芒。猎犬的头部有一张类似人类的脸，由比狗更灵活的脖子支撑着。这种生物散发出一种像烟一样的气味。",
	"Those that stand their ground and fight back discover that mundane weapons partially pass through the hound as if it was made of fog, but magic weapons and silvered weapons can strike true.": "那些站在原地反击的人发现，世俗的武器会部分穿过猎犬，就像它是由雾组成的一样，但魔法武器和银色的武器却能真正击中。",
	" Yeth hounds make a ghastly baying sound that can be heard all around. Creatures that can see a hound when it bays are filled with supernatural fear and usually flee in terror. When a victim tries to run away, a hound delights in chasing after it and tormenting it before bringing the hunt to a close.": " 耶斯猎犬发出可怕的叫声，周围都能听到。当猎犬叫的时候，能看到它的生物充满了超自然的恐惧，通常会吓得逃走。当受害者试图逃跑时，猎犬就会乐此不疲地追赶它，折磨它，然后结束狩猎。",
	" Yeth hounds can't stand sunlight. A pack never willingly prolongs a hunt beyond the night hours and always seeks to return to its dark den before the first rays of dawn. No amount of coercion by a pack's master can deter this behavior. If a yeth hound is exposed to natural sunlight, it fades away, vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, from where its master can retrieve it only after the sun has set.": " 耶斯猎犬不能忍受阳光的照射。一群猎犬从不愿意将狩猎时间延长到晚上，总是试图在黎明的第一道曙光前回到它的黑暗洞穴。无论主人如何胁迫，都无法阻止这种行为。如果猎犬暴露在自然界的阳光下，它就会消逝，消失在虚无缥缈的世界中，只有在太阳落山后，它的主人才能从那里把它找回来。",

These priests perform sacrificial rites to appease their vile gods.": "成为某个特定神灵的祭司信徒的元帝马利森--无论是赛斯、夜蛇丹达，还是梅尔索尔克--往往会通过等级晋升，成为蛇人中的精神领袖。这些祭司举行祭祀仪式来安抚他们卑鄙的神。",

This ritual demands the sacrifice of hundreds of snakes and requires the abomination to bathe in the blood of its enemies. The transformation is quick yet painful.": "憎恶对成神的追求可能会导致它进行一种仪式，如果成功的话，它就会变成一种更伟大的形式：憎恶的元神。这个仪式要求牺牲数百条蛇，并要求憎恶在其敌人的血液中沐浴。这种转变是快速而痛苦的。",
	"Not all yuan-ti are eager to see one of their own become an anathema, since anathemas brutally subjugate their lessers for their own evil ends.": "并非所有的元老都渴望看到他们自己的人成为憎恶者，因为憎恶者为了他们自己的邪恶目的而残酷地征服他们的下级。",
	" An anathema considers itself a demigod on the path to greater divinity. It demands obeisance from weaker yuan-ti and uses every resource at its disposal to launch small-scale wars against its neighbors. Each conquest brings new slaves and sacrifices, as well as glory and riches, that the anathema thinks it needs to achieve true divinity.": " 一个无神论者认为自己是在通往更高的神性的道路上的半神。它要求弱小的元老们服从，并利用其掌握的一切资源，对其邻国发动小规模的战争。每次征服都会带来新的奴隶和牺牲，以及荣耀和财富，无神论者认为它需要实现真正的神性。",
	"An anathema's most loyal yuan-ti followers see it as the pinnacle of the serpentine form, an unbelievable improvement on the nearly perfect abomination. Its devoted human followers think of it as \"divine flesh in a mortal body,\" and cultists serving an anathema tend to be more bloodthirsty and self-sacrificing in its presence.": "无神论者最忠诚的元神追随者将其视为蛇形的巅峰之作，是对近乎完美的憎恶的不可思议的改进。它忠实的人类追随者认为它是 \"凡人身体里的神圣肉体\"，而为无神论者服务的邪教徒在它面前往往会更加嗜血和自我牺牲。",

Truly powerful ones can grow to rule multiple yuan-ti cities and bring entire regions, including humanoid realms, under yuan-ti control.": " 安纳塔斯不会衰老，允许他们追求他们的目标，直到天荒地老。真正强大的安纳塔斯可以发展到统治多个元老级城市，并将整个地区，包括人形王国，置于元老级的控制之下。",
	"Broodguards are humanoids transformed by yuan-ti into simple-minded, scaly creatures that do their masters' bidding.

It has beady, bloodshot eyes and a forked tongue, and smells faintly of rotting meat. Broodguards can speak but rarely do so, preferring to use snake-like hisses and guttural noises.": " 大多数守夜人都是由人类囚犯制成的，他们被迫饮用一种神奇的药剂，使他们无能为力，无法抵御不可避免的事情。被改造成守夜人的人类失去了所有曾经的模样，甚至连它的人类起源都几乎无法辨认。守夜人没有头发，很憔悴，皮肤呈黄绿色，有鳞片。它有一双炯炯有神的血色眼睛和一条分叉的舌头，并有淡淡的腐肉味。守尸人可以说话，但很少这样做，他们更喜欢用蛇一样的嘶嘶声和咕咕声。",

Yuan-ti temples stood at the centers of ancient metropolises, reaching ever higher in prayer to the gods they longed to emulate. In time, the serpent gods heard those prayers, their sibilant voices responding from the darkness as they told the yuan-ti what they must do. The yuan-ti religion grew more fanatical in its devotion. Cults bound themselves to the worship of the serpent gods and imitated their ways, indulging in cannibalism and humanoid sacrifice. Through foul sorcery, the yuan-ti bred with snakes, utterly sacrificing their humanity to become like the serpent gods in form, as well as in thought and emotion.": "元帝文化是凡人世界中最富有的文化之一。他们的战士是富有传奇色彩的，他们的帝国一直在扩张。元帝的寺庙矗立在古代大都市的中心，向他们渴望效仿的神灵祈祷，祈求越来越高。久而久之，蛇神听到了这些祈祷，他们从黑暗中发出咝咝的声音，告诉元帝他们必须做什么。元帝的宗教在其奉献中变得更加狂热。邪教将自己捆绑在对蛇神的崇拜上，并模仿他们的方式，沉迷于食人和人形祭祀。通过肮脏的巫术，元老们与蛇交配，完全牺牲了自己的人性，在形式上、思想上和情感上都变得像蛇神。",
	"Yuan-ti know that the world they hope to rule can't be bound for long by brute force, and that many creatures will refuse to serve.

Instructions might also be found in a tome devoted to debased wizardry.": "在世界的早期，一群夜行女巫设计了一个仪式，导致了第一个班德霍布的诞生。了解这个仪式的女巫可能会愿意以合适的代价来教授它。一些其他黑暗精灵和强大的恶魔也知道这个过程，一些凡人法师也知晓。指引也可能在一本专门研究堕落巫术的书中找到。",
	"When the ritual to create a banderhobb is complete, flesh, spirit, and shadow combine to produce a creature as big as an ogre. The newly formed monstrosity has spindly limbs that belie great strength. Its broad maw holds a long tongue and rows of fangs, both of which it uses to grab and swallow a creature or perhaps an object the banderhobb intends to steal. Despite its size, a banderhobb makes little noise, moving as silently as the shadows that infuse it. A banderhobb isn't capable of speech, but it can understand orders given to it by its creator and communicates with nearby banderhobbs in a psychic manner.": "当创造一只班德霍布的仪式完成时，肉体、精神和阴影结合在一起，产生了一只和食人魔一样大的生物。这个新形成的怪物有着纤细的四肢，却隐藏着巨大的力量。它宽阔的口中有一条长舌和一排尖牙，它用这两者来抓取和吞噬一只生物，或者也许是它打算偷取的物品。尽管体型庞大，班德霍布几乎没有发出任何声音，像注入其中的阴影一样悄无声息地移动。班德霍布不能说话，但它能理解其创造者给予它的命令，并通过精神方式与附近的班德霍布进行交流。",
	"During its brief existence, a banderhobb attempts to carry out the bidding of the one who birthed it. It accomplishes its mission with no concern for the harm it suffers or creates. Its only desire is to serve and succeed. A banderhobb that is assigned to track down a target is particularly dangerous when it is provided with a lock of hair, a personal belonging, or other object connected to the target. Possession of such an item allows it to sense the creature's location from as far as a mile away.": "在其短暂的存在期间，一只班德霍布试图执行孵化它的人的命令。它完成任务时不关心自身遭受的伤害或造成的危害。它唯一的愿望是服务并成功。一只被指派追踪目标的班德霍布在获得目标的一缕头发、个人物品或其他与目标有关的物品时尤为危险。拥有这样的物品使它能够感知目标的位置，距离可达一英里之遥。",
	"Bheur hags are attracted to selfish actions justified by deadly cold, such as murdering a traveler for a winter coat, chopping down a dryad's grove for firewood, and so on. These actions are especially sweet to a bheur if they are unwarranted, such as a greedy merchant hoarding more food for the winter than he could possibly eat while others starve. Bheurs love to seed such ideas and thoughts in mortals. They use their ability to manipulate weather to batter villages with snow and freezing cold, hoping to instill despair that turns the villagers against each other.": "Bheur hags（冰雪女巫）被自私行为所吸引，这些行为是以致命的寒冷为借口的，比如为了一件冬衣而杀害旅行者，为了柴火而砍伐树精的树林等等。如果这些行为是毫无理由的，比如一个贪婪的商人在冬天囤积更多食物，而其他人却挨饿，那么这些行为对冰雪女巫来说尤为甜美。冰雪女巫喜欢在凡人中灌输这样的想法和思想。她们利用操纵天气的能力，用雪和严寒袭击村庄，希望灌输绝望，让村民相互对立。",
	"When a bheur hag is fully in the throes of combat and has recently slain one of her foes, she often forgoes a direct attack on her remaining enemies and instead takes a moment to feed on the corpse, dismembering it and tearing meat from bone. The sight of this savagery is enough to render witnesses temporarily insane.": "当一名(bheur hag)完全陷入战斗，并最近杀死了其中一个敌人时，她经常放弃直接攻击剩下的敌人，而是花一点时间吃掉尸体，肢解它并从骨头上撕下肉。这种野蛮行为足以让目击者暂时陷入疯狂。",
	"A bheur hag that is part of a coven (see the \"Hag Covens\" sidebar in the Monster Manual) has a challenge rating of 9 (5,000 XP).": "一个属于一个女巫结社的(bheur hag)的挑战等级为9(5,000经验值)。",
	"A worshiper of Orcus can take ritual vows while carving the demon lord's symbol on its chest over the heart. Orcus's power flays body, mind, and soul, leaving behind a sentient husk that sucks in all life energy near it. Most bodaks come into being in this way, then unleashed to spread death in Orcus's name.": "一个奉献给奥库斯(Orcus)的信徒可以在胸前心脏上雕刻恶魔领主的符号时宣誓。奥库斯的力量剥皮肉体、精神和灵魂，留下一个有意识的躯壳，吸收附近所有生命能量。大多数博达克(Bodak)都是这样诞生的，然后被释放以传播死亡，以奥库斯的名义。",
	"A bodak retains vague impressions of its past life. It seeks out both its former allies and its former enemies to destroy them, as its warped soul seeks to erase anything connected to its former life. Minions of Orcus are the one exception to this compulsion; a bodak recognizes them as kindred souls and spares them from its wrath. Anyone who knew the individual before its transformation into a bodak can recognize mannerisms or other subtle clues to its original identity.": "一名博达克（Bodak）保留着对其过去生活的模糊印象。它寻找其以前的盟友和敌人，试图摧毁他们，因为它扭曲的灵魂试图抹去与其以前生活有关的一切。奥库斯（Orcus）的爪牙是这种冲动的唯一例外；博达克认出他们是同类灵魂，并放过他们。任何在其变成博达克之前认识这个个体的人都可以通过举止或其他微妙的线索来识别其原始身份。",
	"The soul of a creature that becomes a bodak is so damaged that it is unfit for most forms of magical resurrection. Only a {@spell wish} spell or similar magic can return a bodak to its former life.": "一个成为博达克(Bodak)的生物的灵魂受到了如此严重的损伤，以至于大多数形式的魔法复活都无法修复。只有{@spell wish}法术或类似的魔法才能让博达克重返生命。",
	"A bodak doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "一只博达克(Bodak)不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Boggles engage in petty pranks to amuse themselves, passing the time at their hosts' expense. A boggle isn't above breaking dishes, hiding tools, making frightening sounds to startle cows and sour their milk, or hiding a baby in an attic. Although a boggle's antics might cause distress and unintentional harm, mischief-not mayhem-is usually its intent. If threatened, a boggle flees rather than stand and fight.": "波格尔(Boggles)会进行小恶作剧来取乐，消磨时间，损害他们的主人。波格尔并不介意打破碟子、藏起工具、发出恐怖的声音吓唬牛，使它们产奶变酸，或者把一个婴儿藏在阁楼里。尽管波格尔的恶作剧可能会带来困扰和无意的伤害，但它通常只是出于恶作剧的目的，而非制造混乱。如果受到威胁，波格尔会逃跑而不是站出来战斗。",
	"A boggle excretes an oil from its pores and can make its oil slippery or sticky. The oil dries up and disappears an hour later.": "一只波格尔从其毛孔分泌出一种油，可以使其油变得滑滑的或粘粘的。这种油在一小时后会干燥消失。",
	"A boggle can create magical openings to travel short distances or to pilfer items that would otherwise be beyond its reach. To create such a rift in space, a boggle must be adjacent to a space defined by a frame, such as an open window or a doorway, a gap between the bars of a cage, or the opening between the feet of a bed and the floor. The rift is invisible and disappears after a few seconds-enough time for the boggle to step, reach, or attack through it.": "一只(博戈)可以创造魔法开口，用来短距离移动或窃取那些本来无法触及的物品。要在空间中创造这样一个裂缝，(博戈)必须与一个由框架定义的空间相邻，比如一个开着的窗户或门，笼子的栅栏之间的空隙，或者床脚和地板之间的缝隙。这个裂缝是看不见的，并在几秒钟后消失——这段时间足够(博戈)穿过、伸手或攻击。",
	"A boggle makes a decent servant for a strong-willed master, and wicked creatures such as fomorians and hags sometimes shelter boggles in their lairs. Warlocks who form pacts with archfey have also been known to command boggles, and charismatic individuals who make the right offers have enjoyed temporary alliances with these little tricksters. A bored boggle always finds some way to entertain itself.": "一只顽固的主人对于一个顽劣的生物（博高）来说是个不错的仆从，邪恶生物如弗莫瑞人和女巫有时会庇护博高在它们的巢穴中。与上古精灵签订契约的术士也常常指挥博高，而具有魅力的个体如果提出合适的条件，也能与这些小恶作剧者建立临时联盟。一个无聊的博高总能找到一些方式来娱乐自己。",
	"This goblin warlock serves a patron who can extract payment in flesh if the goblin doesn't do as promised. Often this patron is a coven of hags serving as the tribe's boss, a fiend that has made its way into the world, or an undying lord such as a lich or a vampire. (For more information on undying lord patrons, see the {@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|SCAG}).": "这个地精术士侍奉一个能够以肉体作为代价的主人，如果地精不如约定那样行事，主人就会提取代价。通常这个主人是一群女巫组成的魔法同盟，担任部落的首领，或者是一个闯入这个世界的恶魔，或者是一个不死领主，比如巫妖或吸血鬼。(有关不死领主主人的更多信息，请参见{@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|SCAG})。",
	"This goblin found a magic item (a {@item necklace of fireballs}, a {@item circlet of blasting}, or the like) and learned how to use it.": "这只地精找到了一个魔法物品（一个{@item necklace of fireballs}、一个{@item circlet of blasting}，或类似的物品），并学会了如何使用它。",
	"Despite their ungainly physiology, catoblepases resemble natural beasts. A catoblepas behaves much like an animal, too, ambling through its marshy home, munching choice vegetation, eating the occasional bit of carrion, and wallowing in mire. A catoblepas might be found with the one mate it chooses for life and, on occasion, a calf. Especially if it's guarding its young, a catoblepas attacks anyone that moves too close.": "尽管它们笨拙的生理特征，猫头兽(catoblepases)与自然野兽相似。猫头兽的行为也很像动物，漫步在沼泽家园中，啃食精选植物，偶尔吃些腐肉，沉浸在泥潭中。猫头兽可能会与它一生选择的伴侣以及偶尔的幼崽一起被发现。特别是当它保护幼崽时，猫头兽会攻击任何靠得太近的人。",
	"A catoblepas's stink, like that of death mixed with swamp gas and skunk musk, gives it away as being much more ghastly than its appearance suggests. When it is on the attack, a catoblepas reveals the extent of its horrific nature. The creature's serpentine neck has trouble lifting its head, but one glare from its bloodshot eyes can rot flesh. At the end of its tail is a club that can rattle body and soul if it strikes true, leaving a victim unable to act. If the target of its attacks dies, the catoblepas feasts on the fresh remains.": "猫头鹰兽的气味，像是死亡与沼气和臭鼬腺液混合在一起，让它显得比外表更加可怕。当它发动攻击时，猫头鹰兽展现了它恐怖本质的程度。这个生物蛇一般的脖子举起头部有困难，但它那血丝眼睛的一瞥就能腐蚀肉体。在它的尾巴末端是一根棍棒，如果击中目标，可以震动身心，让受害者无法行动。如果它的攻击目标死亡，猫头鹰兽会享用新鲜的尸体。",
	"A catoblepas's nature as a creature of disease and decay brings out similar characteristics in the creature's swampy habitat. Such a wetland becomes gloomy, tangled, and more fetid than it was before. Beneficial qualities of the environment, such as healing herbs and clean water, diminish when a catoblepas lives nearby. Swamp gases have a hint of the catoblepas's foulness to them. Animals in the area are more aggressive and liable to be diseased. Degenerate creatures are likely to take up residence near a catoblepas's territory, as are those seeking to avoid notice.": "一只猫头鹰兽作为一种疾病和腐朽的生物，使得它所在的沼泽栖息地也显现出类似的特征。这样的湿地变得阴郁、纠缠不清，比以前更加恶臭。环境中的有益特质，如治愈草药和清洁水源，在猫头鹰兽附近生活时会减弱。沼气中带有一丝猫头鹰兽的腐臭气息。该地区的动物更加具有攻击性，更容易患病。堕落的生物很可能会在猫头鹰兽的领地附近定居，那些想要避免被注意到的人也会选择在这附近居住。",
	"Ordinary folk rarely see a catoblepas, but the creature has such a feared reputation that stories about it are ingrained in the popular culture. Any rumor of a catoblepas taking up residence nearby is taken to be a bad omen, even if the rumor is proven false. The silhouette of a catoblepas, with its tail extended over its body and its head held low, is a baleful heraldic figure signifying death or doom.": "普通人很少见到猫头兽，但这种生物却有着令人畏惧的名声，关于它的故事深深扎根于流行文化中。任何关于猫头兽在附近定居的传闻都被视为不祥之兆，即使这些传闻被证明是假的。猫头兽的轮廓，尾巴伸展在身体上方，头低垂，是一个凶兆的纹章图案，象征着死亡或厄运。",
	"A cave fisher usually hunts small animals and is fond of bats, so it stretches its filament over an opening that such prey might travel through. It then climbs to a hiding spot and adheres itself to the surface to rest and wait. When prey blunders into the filament, the cave fisher reels in its meal. A group of cave fishers might work together to cover a large area with filaments, but as soon as one captures potential food, every cave fisher in the area competes for the prize. If a victim escapes from the initial ambush, a cave fisher can reclaim its prey by shooting a filament out to capture it again.": "洞穴捕鱼者通常猎捕小动物，喜欢蝙蝠，因此它会将自己的丝状物伸展在这类猎物可能穿过的开口上。然后它会爬到一个藏身之处，粘附在表面上休息等待。当猎物不慎碰到丝状物时，洞穴捕鱼者就会收回它的食物。一群洞穴捕鱼者可能会合作覆盖一个大区域的丝状物，但一旦有一只捕获潜在食物，该区域内的每只洞穴捕鱼者都会争夺这个奖品。如果一名受害者从最初的伏击中逃脱，洞穴捕鱼者可以射出丝状物再次捕获它。",
	"Scarce food might draw a group of cave fishers up to the surface, into a shadowy canyon or a gloomy forest that features both native animal prey and creatures such as explorers or travelers occasionally moving through the area.": "稀缺的食物可能会吸引一群洞穴渔夫来到地表，进入一个阴暗的峡谷或阴森的森林，那里有本地动物作为猎物，也有像探险家或旅行者这样偶尔穿过该地区的生物。",
	"Nearly every part of a cave fisher is useful after the creature has been dispatched. Its blood is alcoholic and tastes like strong liquor. Several dwarven spirits include cave fisher blood as part of the recipe, and some dwarves, especially berserkers, drink the blood straight. If they are gathered after being extruded, cave fisher filaments can be woven into rope that is thin, tough, and nearly invisible. Cave fisher meat is edible, tasting much like crab cooked in strong wine. The creature's shell is used in the manufacture of tools, armor, and jewelry.": "几乎每个部分的洞穴渔夫在生物被消灭后都是有用的。它的血液是含酒精的，味道像浓烈的酒。一些矮人烈酒中包括洞穴渔夫的血液作为配方的一部分，一些矮人，尤其是狂战士，会直接饮用这种血液。如果它们在被挤出后被收集起来，洞穴渔夫的丝可以被编织成绳，这种绳又细又坚固，几乎看不见。洞穴渔夫的肉是可以食用的，味道很像用浓烈葡萄酒烹饪的螃蟹。这种生物的壳被用于制造工具、盔甲和珠宝。",
	"While some folk hunt cave fishers to kill them for their filaments and their blood, others capture cave fisher eggs and rear the hatchlings. Cave fishers have a natural aversion to fire, since their blood is flammable. As such, chitines and hobgoblins sometimes use the threat of fire to train cave fishers, then employ them to guard passages or as beasts of war.": "一些人猎杀洞穴渔蛛，以获取它们的丝线和血液，而另一些人则捕捉洞穴渔蛛的蛋并培育幼崽。洞穴渔蛛天生对火有厌恶感，因为它们的血液易燃。因此，几丁虫族和地精有时利用火的威胁来训练洞穴渔蛛，然后让它们守卫通道或作为战争兽使用。",
	"Long ago, the drow first subjected elf prisoners to horrible rituals that transformed the captives into creatures with both humanoid and spider traits, which their creators dubbed chitines. The dark elves' intention was to create slaves dedicated first of all to the drow and, by association with them, to Lolth. As the drow ultimately discovered, the goddess found this arrangement unacceptable.": "很久以前，黑暗精灵首次将精灵囚犯置于可怕的仪式之下，将这些俘虏转化为既有人类又有蜘蛛特征的生物，它们的创造者称之为奇汀(%(chitines)%)。黑暗精灵的意图是创造出首先忠于黑暗精灵，其次与洛思(%(Lolth)%)有关联的奴隶。然而，黑暗精灵最终发现，女神发现这种安排是不可接受的。",
	"As the drow continued to perform the rituals, the process usually transformed the subject into the spindly, stunted creature they expected. Occasionally, though, the elf changed into a monstrosity that was more spider than elf, resembling Lolth in her spider form, and more cunning than a chitine, that the drow dubbed a choldrith.": "当黑暗精灵继续进行仪式时，这个过程通常会将对象转变成他们期望的细长、矮小的生物。偶尔，然而，这个精灵会变成一个更像蜘蛛而不是精灵的怪物，类似于洛思在蜘蛛形态下的样子，比奇汀更狡猾，黑暗精灵称之为科德里斯(`Lolth`)。",
	"Choldriths are born with a fanatical devotion to Lolth, which leads them to develop some skill in divine magic. They preach that chitines are Lolth's favored people, and that choldriths are the Spider Queen's rightful worldly representatives sent to free the chitines from slavery. Although choldriths and chitines lack sexual characteristics, and choldriths need no mate to lay eggs, these creatures choose the gender identity of their goddess. Choldriths also believe and teach that Lolth's spider form, much like that of a choldrith, is her truest shape. Any idol to Lolth in a chitine colony depicts Lolth in this way.": "Choldriths(柯德里斯)出生时就对洛思(Lolth)怀有狂热的虔诚，这使得它们在神圣魔法方面有一定的技能。它们宣扬奇汀(Chitines)是洛思最喜爱的族群，而柯德里斯是蜘蛛女王的合法世俗代表，被派来解救奇汀免于奴役。尽管柯德里斯和奇汀都没有性别特征，柯德里斯也不需要配偶来产卵，但这些生物选择了她们女神的性别认同。柯德里斯还相信并传授，洛思的蜘蛛形态，就像柯德里斯一样，是她最真实的形态。奇汀殖民地中任何对洛思的偶像都描绘了洛思这样的形象。",
	"Smiling ones take their name from the strange two-faced masks they wear. The smiling half of the face often looks more like a smirk or a triumphant sneer than a pleasant grin. The frowning half represents the displeasure smiling ones feel about their place in the ordning-second to the storm giants. The masks serve as symbols of their devotion, but they also conceal their wearers' true facial expressions.": "微笑者们的名字源自他们戴着的奇怪的双面面具。脸的微笑一半常常更像是一丝冷笑或者得意的冷笑，而不是愉快的笑容。脸的皱眉一半代表了微笑者对自己在（风暴巨人）的次序中感到的不满。这些面具既象征着他们的忠诚，又掩盖了他们真实的面部表情。",
	"The Summer Queen's curse causes a darkling's body to absorb light, and doing so wizens the creature, much like the effect of rapid aging. For this reason, darklings cover every part of their body with clothing when exposure to light is a risk. The light a darkling absorbs over the course of its lifetime explodes outward when the darkling dies, incinerating the creature and much of its possessions.": "夏日女王的诅咒导致暗影族的身体吸收光线，这会使这些生物变得枯槁，就像快速老化的效果一样。因此，暗影族在有光线风险的情况下会用衣物遮盖身体的每一个部位。暗影族在一生中吸收的光线在其死亡时会向外爆发，将这些生物和它们的大部分财产焚毁。",
	"Despite their curse, darklings retain a fondness for the beauty of art. A darkling might risk taking a peek at a sunset or lighting a tiny candle to glimpse the colors in a painting or a jewel.": "尽管受到诅咒，暗影生物仍然对艺术之美怀有深情。一个暗影生物可能会冒险偷看日落，或点燃一支小蜡烛，以窥探绘画或珠宝中的色彩。",
	"A wise and respected darkling can qualify to undergo a ritual to become an elder. Other elders mark the supplicant with glowing tattoos, channeling some of the darkling's absorbed light away from its body. If the ritual succeeds, the darkling grows into a tall and fair form, like that of a gray-skinned elf. The darkling perishes if the ritual fails.": "一位睿智且备受尊敬的黑暗精灵有资格接受仪式，成为一位长者。其他长者会用发光的纹身标记供奉者，将一部分被吸收的光从黑暗精灵的身体中引导出来。如果仪式成功，黑暗精灵会成长为一个高大而美丽的形态，类似于灰色皮肤的精灵。如果仪式失败，黑暗精灵将灭亡。",
	"A death kiss survives solely on ingested blood, which it uses to generate electrical energy inside its body. Paranoid about dying from starvation, it obsessively drains even little creatures such as rats in an effort to stave off this fate for as long as possible. After it drains its prey, it abandons the corpse to scavengers. A death kiss prefers to hunt alone. If it meets another death kiss, it might fight, flee, or team up, depending on its health and pride. When underground, it uses its tentacles as feelers, prodding and examining the environment in all directions. Above ground, it usually keeps its tentacles retracted when on the hunt, then lashes out and extends them to their full length to catch opponents off guard.": "死亡之吻(Death Kiss)仅靠摄入的血液存活，用以在体内产生电能。它对于因饥饿而死亡感到极度偏执，痴迷地吸干甚至是老鼠等小生物，以尽可能延缓这种命运。在吸干猎物后，它会将尸体抛弃给食腐动物。死亡之吻更喜欢独自狩猎。如果遇到另一个死亡之吻，根据自身健康和自尊，它可能会战斗、逃跑或者合作。在地下时，它会将触手用作触角，向各个方向探测和检查环境。在地面上，它通常在狩猎时收起触手，然后突然伸展并将其完全伸展，以使对手措手不及。",
	"In poor lighting and with its tentacles extended, a death kiss can be mistaken for a true beholder. It might purposely present itself as a beholder to an ignorant creature, but this behavior is rare, since it usually is focused on hunting and lacks the self-importance and paranoia of a true beholder. It can speak through any of its tentacle-throats, and its voice sounds nasal and high-pitched. A true beholder has little to fear from a death kiss, since it can easily kill or subdue the death kiss long before the death kiss gets into melee range. Thus, out of self-preservation, a death kiss usually submits to the rule of a beholder that it encounters, though it might attempt to escape as soon as its master is preoccupied.": "在光线不足的情况下，一个死亡之吻（Death Kiss）伸展着触须时，可能会被误认为是一个真正的眼魔（Beholder）。它可能会故意将自己呈现为一个眼魔来愚弄无知的生物，但这种行为很少见，因为它通常专注于狩猎，缺乏真正眼魔的自大和偏执。它可以通过任何一个触须喉咙说话，声音听起来鼻音尖细。一个真正的眼魔几乎不用害怕死亡之吻，因为它可以轻松地杀死或制服死亡之吻，远在死亡之吻进入近战范围之前。因此，出于自我保护，死亡之吻通常会服从遇到的眼魔的统治，尽管它可能会在主人分心时试图逃跑。",
	"A death kiss lacks the combat finesse and intelligence of a beholder. It might attempt an unusual maneuver to control its prey (such as flying up while grappling), but in most cases, it attaches one or more of its tentacles to a creature and drains blood until its prey collapses. If it is in a superior position and its opponent poses no threat, it might toy with its food, slowly squeezing and draining the life out of a creature.": "死亡之吻缺乏持有者的战斗技巧和智慧。它可能会尝试一种不寻常的策略来控制猎物（比如在搏斗时飞起来），但在大多数情况下，它会用触手附着在生物身上，并吸取血液直到猎物倒地。如果它处于优势地位且对手毫无威胁，它可能会戏弄食物，慢慢地挤压并吸取生物的生命。",
	"A deep scion emerges from the depths in service to its underwater master, which is likely a kraken or some other ancient being of the deep. While wearing the mind and body of the person it once was as a sort of mask, the creature is bent on fulfilling its master's desires. Sometimes a deep scion returns to its former home and a hero's welcome-unexpectedly found alive when all hope was lost. At other times the deep scion takes on a new identity. In any case, it is the deep scion's duty to infiltrate the air-breathing world and report back to its master. When set to its task, a deep scion worms its way into the life of an unsuspecting enemy as a new best friend, an irresistible lover, the perfect candidate for a job, or in some other role that enables the minion to carry out its master's commands.": "一个深渊之子（deep scion）从深渊中浮现，效忠于其水下主人，很可能是一只巨型章鱼或其他深海古老存在。这个生物将前身的思想和身体当作一种面具，致力于实现主人的愿望。有时，深渊之子会返回其曾经的家园，受到英雄般的欢迎——当所有希望似乎已经破灭时，却意外地被发现还活着。在其他时候，深渊之子会扮演新的身份。无论如何，深渊之子的职责是渗透到呼吸空气的世界并向其主人汇报情报。在执行任务时，深渊之子会以新的最好朋友、无法抗拒的恋人、完美的工作候选人，或者其他角色的身份潜入到毫无戒心的敌人生活中，以便执行主人的命令。",
	"The training to which a deep scion is subjected rids it of empathy for those whom it spies on. Though one might behave as though infatuated, laugh at the joke of a friend, or appear incensed at some injustice, each of these acts is artificial to the deep scion, a means to an end. It believes that its true form is the shape it takes when it returns to the sea that it thinks of as home. Ironically, however, a deep scion that is killed when in its piscine form is stripped of the magic that robbed it of emotion, leaving behind the corpse of the person the deep scion once was.": "深渊之子接受的训练让它失去了对那些它监视的人的同情心。尽管它可能表现得像是陶醉，对朋友的笑话发笑，或者对某种不公感到愤怒，但对于深渊之子来说，这些行为都是虚假的，是达到目的的手段。它相信自己真正的形态是当它回到被视为家园的海洋时所呈现的形态。然而具有讽刺意味的是，一个深渊之子如果在鱼形态下被杀死，就会被剥夺掉让它失去情感的魔法，留下的只是深渊之子曾经的人的尸体。",
	"A lesser demon that proves itself to Orcus might be granted the privilege of becoming a devourer. The Prince of Undeath transforms such a demon into an 8-foot-tall, desiccated humanoid with a hollowed-out ribcage, then fills the new creature with a hunger for souls. Orcus grants each new devourer the essence of a less fortunate demon to power the devourer's first foray into the planes. Most devourers remain in the Abyss, or on the Astral or Ethereal Plane, pursuing Orcus's schemes and interests in those realms. When Orcus sends devourers to the Material Plane, he often sets them on a mission to create, control, and lead a plague of undead. Skeletons, zombies, ghouls and ghasts, and shadows are particularly attracted to the presence of a devourer.": "一个向奥库斯(Orcus)证明自己的次等恶魔可能被授予成为一名吞噬者的特权。这位亡灵王子将这样的恶魔转变为一个八英尺高的干瘪人形生物，胸腔中空，然后灌输给这个新生物对灵魂的饥渴。奥库斯为每个新的吞噬者赋予一个不那么幸运的恶魔的本质，以供给吞噬者在位面中的初次探险。大多数吞噬者留在深渊，或者在星界或以太界，追随奥库斯在这些领域中的计划和利益。当奥库斯派遣吞噬者前往物质位面时，他经常让他们执行一个任务：创造、控制和领导一场不死瘟疫。骷髅、僵尸、食尸鬼和幽灵，以及阴影特别被吞噬者的存在所吸引。",
	"Devourers hunt humanoids, with the intent of consuming them body and soul. After a devourer brings a target to the brink of death, it pulls the victim's body in and traps the creature within its own ribcage. As the victim tries to stave off death (usually without success), the devourer tortures its soul with telepathic noise. When the victim expires, it undergoes a horrible transformation, springing forth from the devourer's body to begin its new existence as an undead servitor of the monster that spawned it.": "吞噬者猎杀人形生物，目的是吞噬他们的肉体和灵魂。在吞噬者将目标推向死亡边缘后，它将受害者的身体拉入并困住在自己的肋骨笼内。当受害者试图抵御死亡（通常无功而返）时，吞噬者用心灵感应的噪音折磨其灵魂。当受害者死去时，它会经历可怕的变化，从吞噬者的身体中蹦出，开始作为其创造者的怪物的不死仆从展开新的存在。",
	"A devourer doesn't require air, food (other than souls), drink, or sleep.": "吞噬者不需要空气、食物（除了灵魂）、饮料或睡眠。",
	"The ritual to create a draegloth succeeds only rarely, but when it does, it is a great event that is seen by the drow of the house as a sign of the demon lord Lolth's favor-and a sign of Lolth's disregard for the family's rivals, which were not thus gifted. The birth prompts the leaders of the house to begin crafting new plans to strike at its rivals when the draegloth is fully grown. These plans always use the draegloth in a significant role, because its abilities can turn the tide in a battle against a house that doesn't have a draegloth of its own.": "创造一只德拉格洛斯的仪式很少成功，但一旦成功，对于家族的黑暗精灵来说，这是一个重大事件，被视为恶魔领主洛思的青睐迹象，也是洛思对家族对手的漠视的象征，因为他们没有得到这样的赐予。这种诞生促使家族的领导者开始制定新计划，等待德拉格洛斯长大后对对手发动攻击。这些计划总是让德拉格洛斯扮演重要角色，因为它的能力可以在与没有自己德拉格洛斯的家族对抗时扭转局势。",
	"Although it plays an important part in the welfare of its house, a draegloth can't rise above the status of a favored slave or a consort to a priestess. Before a draegloth is given any duties, it receives instruction in accepting the role set for it and not challenging authority. Draegloths instinctively resist this sort of treatment, but most of them take out their frustration on their house's enemies. A draegloth that can't suppress its ambitions might abandon its house and strike out on its own. Whether these rebellious draegloths are part of Lolth's plan for sowing even greater chaos is unclear.": "虽然它在家族的福祉中扮演着重要角色，但一只半蜘蛛恶魔 (draegloth) 无法超越被视为宠儿奴隶或女祭司的伴侣的地位。在半蜘蛛恶魔被赋予任何职责之前，它会接受接受为其设定的角色并不挑战权威的指导。半蜘蛛恶魔本能地抵抗这种对待，但大多数会将他们的挫折发泄在家族的敌人身上。无法抑制野心的半蜘蛛恶魔可能会抛弃家族，独自行动。这些叛逆的半蜘蛛恶魔是否是洛思 (Lolth) 用来播撒更大混乱的计划的一部分尚不清楚。",

	"Every few years, a froghemoth can lay a fertile egg without mating. The froghemoth cares nothing for its egg, and might eat the hatchling. A young froghemoth's survival is most often predicated on its parent leaving it behind in indifference. A newborn froghemoth grows to full size over a period of months by indiscriminately preying on other creatures in its swampy domain. It learns to hide its enormous body in murky pools, keeping only its eyestalk above water to watch for passing creatures.

	"If a bullywug tribe comes across a froghemoth, the bullywugs treat the froghemoth as a god and do all they can to coax the monster into their den. A froghemoth can be tamed (after a fashion) by offering it food, and bullywugs can communicate with it on a basic level, so the creature might eat only a few bullywugs before following the rest. Bullywugs gather food as tribute for it, provide it with a comfortable lair, fanatically protect it from harm, and try to ensure that any young froghemoth reaches maturity.": "如果一个蛙人部落遇到了一只蛙妖，蛙人会将蛙妖视为神，并尽一切努力诱导这只怪物进入他们的巢穴。蛙妖可以通过提供食物来被驯服（在某种程度上），蛙人可以基本上与它交流，因此这只生物可能只会吃掉一些蛙人后跟随其他人。蛙人为它收集食物作为贡品，为它提供舒适的巢穴，狂热地保护它免受伤害，并努力确保任何年幼的蛙妖能够成年。",
	"Frost giants mainly turn to Vaprak, a rapacious god of strength and hunger worshiped by ogres and trolls, out of desperation. Vaprak likes to tempt frost giants with dreams of glory followed by nightmares of bloody cannibalism. Those who don't shrink from such visions or report them to priests of Thrym receive more of the same. If a frost giant comes to relish these dreams and nightmares, as some do, Vaprak sets a troll upon a sacred quest to find the frost giant and meet it in secret. The troll offers up its own body to be devoured in Vaprak's name. Only the boldest and most determined frost giants can finish such a gory feast.": "冰霜巨人主要转向瓦普拉克(Vaprak), 一个被食人魔和巨魔崇拜的贪婪之神，出于绝望。瓦普拉克喜欢用荣耀的梦境诱惑冰霜巨人，然后是血腥的食人噩梦。那些不畏惧这些幻象或不向锡姆神的祭司报告的人会得到更多同样的经历。如果有些冰霜巨人开始喜欢这些梦境和噩梦，瓦普拉克会派遣一个巨魔进行一项神圣任务，找到这个冰霜巨人并秘密会面。巨魔将自己的身体献祭给瓦普拉克。只有最勇敢和最坚定的冰霜巨人才能完成这样一个血腥的盛宴。",
	"After devouring the troll sent by Vaprak, bones and all, a frost giant becomes an everlasting one, gaining tremendous strength, an ill temper, and a troll's regenerative ability. With these gifts, the frost giant can swiftly claim the title of jarl and easily fend off rivals for decades. However, if the frost giant doesn't give enough honor to Vaprak or fails to heed Vaprak's visions, injuries the frost giant sustains heal wrong, often resulting in discolored skin, warty scars, and vestigial body parts, such as extra digits, limbs, and even extra heads. The touch of Vaprak can no longer be hidden then, and the everlasting one is either killed or exiled by its clan. Sometimes small communities of everlasting ones gather and even reproduce, passing the \"blessing\" and worship of Vaprak from one generation to the next.": "在吞噬了由瓦普拉克(Vaprak)派遣的巨魔，包括骨头在内之后，一名冰霜巨人变成了永生者，获得了巨大的力量、易怒的脾气和巨魔的再生能力。凭借这些天赋，冰霜巨人可以迅速获得亚尔(Jarl)的头衔，并轻松击退数十年的竞争对手。然而，如果冰霜巨人没有给予足够的敬意给瓦普拉克，或者不听从瓦普拉克的启示，那么冰霜巨人遭受的伤势会愈合不当，常常导致皮肤变色、长有疣痣的疤痕，以及残留的身体部位，比如额外的手指、肢体，甚至额外的头颅。那时，瓦普拉克的触碰将再也无法隐藏，永生者将被其家族杀死或流放。有时，一些永生者的小社区会聚集起来，甚至繁衍后代，将瓦普拉克的“祝福”和崇拜代代相传。",

	"Ki-rins are the embodiment of good, and simply beholding one can evoke fear or awe in an observer. A typical ki-rin looks like a muscular stag the size of an elephant, covered in golden scales lined in some places with golden fur. It has a dark gold mane and tail, coppery cloven hooves, and a spiral-shaped coppery horn just above and between its luminous violet eyes. In a breeze or when aloft, the creature's scales and hair can create the impression that the ki-rin is ablaze with a holy, golden fire.": "麒麟是善的化身，仅仅看到一只就能在观察者心中引起恐惧或敬畏。一只典型的麒麟看起来像一只体型像大象般肌肉发达的雄鹿，覆盖着一层金色鳞片，有些地方还长着金色的毛。它有一头深金色的鬃毛和尾巴，铜色的分蹄，以及一只螺旋形的铜色角，正好位于它那发光的紫色眼睛之上和之间。在微风中或飞翔时，这个生物的鳞片和毛发会让人觉得麒麟仿佛被一团神圣的金色火焰所包围。",
	"Common folk consider ki-rins to be rare and remote heralds of good fortune. Seeing a ki-rin fly overhead is a blessing, and events that happen on such a day are especially auspicious. If a ki-rin alights during a ceremony, such as a birth announcement or a coronation, everyone present understands that the creature is telling them great good could be in the offing. The ki-rin conveys its gifts and omens, then rises back into the sky. Ki-rins have also been known to appear at the sites of great battles to inspire and strengthen the side of good, or to rescue heroes from certain death.": "普通人认为麒麟是罕见而神秘的好运使者。看到一只麒麟飞过头顶是一种祝福，而在这一天发生的事件尤其吉利。如果一只麒麟在一个仪式上降落，比如一个出生公告或加冕典礼，所有在场的人都明白这个生物在告诉他们可能会有极大的好运降临。麒麟传达它的礼物和预兆，然后再次升入天空。麒麟也被知道会出现在伟大战役的战场上，激励和增强正义一方，或者拯救英雄免于必死。",
	"Because a ki-rin is renowned for its wisdom, other creatures would naturally seek it out with questions and requests if they could. For that reason among others, the creature makes its lair atop a forbidding mountain peak or in some other equally inaccessible location. Only those that have the tenacity to complete the daunting journey to a ki-rin's lair can prove themselves worthy of speaking with its occupant.": "因为一只麒麟以其智慧而闻名，其他生物自然会寻求它并向它提出问题和请求，如果可能的话。因此，这种生物选择在险峻的山峰之巅或其他同样难以接近的地方建造巢穴。只有那些有毅力完成前往麒麟巢穴的艰难旅程的人才能证明自己有资格与其交谈。",
	"A dragonshield knows that it has a place of honor in the tribe, but-being kobolds at heart-most of them feel unworthy of their status and thus desperate to prove themselves deserving of it. A dragonshield's natural kobold cowardice is still present in its makeup, and thus it might still run away from a threat. But it also has the ability to rally in the face of certain death, inspiring other kobolds to follow it in a charge against the invaders of their warren.": "龙盾（Dragonshield）知道自己在部落中有着尊贵的地位，但作为心怀龙族血统的龙裔，他们中的大多数人觉得自己不配拥有这个地位，因此急于证明自己配得上。龙盾天生的龙裔懦弱仍然存在于其基因中，因此在面临威胁时可能会逃跑。但它也有能力在面对必死之局时振作起来，鼓舞其他龙裔一起冲锋，对抗入侵者。",
	"An inventor's new weapons last for only one or two attacks before they break, but might be surprisingly effective in the meantime. Most inventors are skilled enough that their improvised weapons don't backfire on them, but other users might not be so lucky. The weapons don't have to be lethal-in many cases one serves its purpose if it distracts, scares, or confuses a creature long enough for other kobolds to kill the enemy. In any particular encounter, an inventor usually has one or two improvised weapons at its disposal.": "一位发明家的新武器只能持续一到两次攻击就会损坏，但在此期间可能会出奇地有效。大多数发明家都有足够的技能，使他们的临时武器不会对他们产生负面影响，但其他使用者可能就没有那么幸运了。这些武器不一定要致命-在许多情况下，如果一件武器能分散敌人的注意力、吓唬或混淆敌人足够长的时间，那么它就达到了其目的。在任何特定的遭遇中，一位发明家通常只有一到两件临时武器可供使用。",
	"In a kobold tribe associated with a dragon, typically one that resides in or near the dragon's lair, the scale sorcerer also serves as diplomat and mouthpiece-anticipating the dragon's needs, issuing commands to other kobolds on the dragon's behalf, and reporting information back to the dragon. The sorcerer is just as awed by and respectful of dragons as common kobolds are, but it knows that its duty requires it not to fawn over its master at all times. It also understands that its frequent proximity to the dragon means it would probably be the first to die if its master became angry or displeased, and so it frantically maintains a balance between adoration and terror in its behavior toward the dragon.": "在与龙有关的龙裔部落中，通常是居住在或靠近龙巢的部落中，鳞片术士也充当外交官和代言人-预测龙的需求，代表龙下达命令给其他龙裔，向龙汇报信息。这位术士和普通龙裔一样对龙感到敬畏和尊重，但它知道自己的职责要求它不必时刻谄媚于主人。它也明白，与龙频繁接触意味着如果主人生气或不满意，它可能会是第一个死去的，因此它在对待龙的行为中疯狂地保持崇拜和恐惧之间的平衡。",
	"Korreds prefer to keep their own company and occasionally consort with creatures of elemental earth such as galeb duhr. A tribe of korreds gathers weekly to perform ceremonial dances, beating out rhythms on stone with their hooves and clubs. In the depths of the Material Plane, korreds typically flee from other creatures but become aggressive when they feel insulted or are annoyed by the sounds of mining.": "石灵族（Korreds）喜欢独来独往，偶尔会与元素地灵（galeb duhr）等生物交往。一支石灵族部落每周聚集在一起进行仪式性舞蹈，用蹄子和棍棒在石头上敲击出节奏。在物质位面的深处，石灵族通常会逃离其他生物，但一旦感到受辱或被挖掘的声音惹恼，它们会变得具有攻击性。",
	"No one knows the ways of stone and earth better than a korred. Korreds can seemingly smell veins of metal or gems.

	"Korreds have hair all over their bodies, but the hair that grows from their heads is magical. When cut, it transforms into whatever material was used to cut it. Korreds use iron shears to cut lengths of their hair, then weave the strands together to create iron ropes that they can manipulate, animating them to bind or snake around creatures and objects. Korreds take great pride in their hair, and equally great offense at any one who attempts to cut it without permission.": "科瑞德(Korreds)全身长满毛发，但从头部长出的毛发是魔法的。当被剪下时，它会变成用来剪它的材料。科瑞德使用铁剪剪下一段段头发，然后将这些头发编织在一起，制成铁绳，他们可以操控这些铁绳，让它们缠绕生物和物体。科瑞德对自己的头发非常自豪，而且对任何未经允许剪掉它的人都感到极度愤怒。",
	"The first leucrottas came into being alongside the gnolls during Yeenoghu's rampages on the Material Plane.

Among these bizarre results, leucrottas were the most numerous.": "第一批鬣狗兽与诺尔一起在耶诺古在物质位面上肆虐时出现。一些吃了耶诺古猎物的鬣狗发生了不同的变化，而不是变成了诺尔。在这些奇异的结果中，鬣狗兽是最常见的。",
	"The leucrotta is so loathsome that only gnolls and others of its kind can stand to be around one for long. Its horrific, hodgepodge body oozes a foul stench that pollutes anywhere the creature lairs. This reek is outdone only by the creature's breath, which issues from a maw that drips fluid corrupted with rot and digestive juices. In place of fangs, a leucrotta has bony ridges as hard as steel that can crush bones and lacerate flesh. These plates are so tough that a leucrotta can use them to peel plate armor away from the body of a slain knight.": "鬼狼兽是如此令人厌恶，只有豺狼人和其他同类才能长时间忍受它的存在。它那可怕的、拼凑而成的身体散发着一股恶臭，污染着这个生物栖息的任何地方。这种臭味仅被生物的呼吸所超越，从一个滴着腐烂和消化液的口中喷出。鬼狼兽没有獠牙，而是有着坚硬如钢的骨脊，可以压碎骨头，撕裂肌肉。这些板块如此坚硬，以至于鬼狼兽可以用它们将板甲从被杀死的骑士的身体上剥离。",
	"Meenlocks are spawned by fear. Whenever fear overwhelms a creature in the Feywild, or in any other location where the Feywild's influence is strong, one or more meenlocks might spontaneously arise in the shadows or darkness nearby. If more than one meenlock is born, a lair also magically forms. The earth creaks and moans as narrow, twisting tunnels open up within it. One of these newly formed passageways serves as the lair's only entrance and exit.": "梦锁(Meenlocks)是由恐惧所孕育。每当在Feywild中或其他受Feywild影响的地方，恐惧压倒一只生物时，一个或多个梦锁可能会在附近的阴影或黑暗中突然出现。如果超过一个梦锁诞生，一个巢穴也会奇迹般地形成。大地发出吱吱作响的声音，狭窄、扭曲的隧道在其中打开。这些新形成的通道中的一个将作为巢穴唯一的入口和出口。",
	"A meenlock shuns bright light. It can supernaturally sense areas of darkness and shadow in its vicinity and thus is able to teleport from one darkened space to another-enabling it to sneak up on its prey or run away when outmatched.": "一只米洛克(Meenlock)回避明亮的光线。它能够超自然地感知周围的黑暗和阴影区域，因此能够从一个黑暗的空间传送到另一个空间，使其能够悄悄接近猎物或在势不可挡时逃跑。",

These hallucinations take the form of terrible whispers or fleeting movements just at the edges of one's peripheral vision.": "米恩锁(Meenlocks)除了心灵感应外没有其他形式的交流方式。它们可以利用心灵感应向猎物的头脑中投射令人不安的幻觉。这些幻觉以可怕的低语或在视野边缘掠过的瞬间动作的形式出现。",
	"Solitary mind flayers are likely rogues and outcasts. Most illithids belong to a colony of sibling mind flayers devoted to an elder brain-a massive brain-like being that resides in a briny pool near the center of a mind flayer community. From its pool, an elder brain telepathically dictates its desires to each individual mind flayer within 5 miles of it, for it is able to hold multiple mental conversations at once.": "孤独的思想吸血鬼可能是流氓和被流放者。大多数邪恶的章鱼人属于一个兄弟姐妹思想吸血鬼群体，致力于一颗长者脑-一种类似大脑的生物，它驻扎在思想吸血鬼社区中心附近的一个咸水池中。长者脑通过其池塘，以心灵感应的方式向距离其5英里内的每个思想吸血鬼传达其愿望，因为它能够同时进行多次心灵对话。",

	"Long ago, a deity of greed and strife perished in the battles among the immortals. Its body drifted through the Astral Plane, eventually becoming a petrified husk. This corpse floated up against a pearlescent remnant of celestial matter imbued with life and life-giving magic. The collision shattered both objects and released a storm of chaotic energy. Countless islands of mixed matter spun away into the silvery void. Within some of them, a vein of pearl-like material held a bit of the deity's rejuvenated supernatural vitality, which spontaneously created a habitable environment. On those same islands, bits of the god's petrified flesh came back to life, in the form of tentacled monstrosities brimming with malice and greed. Ever since that time, each morkoth has had an extraplanar island to call home.": "很久以前，一位贪婪和冲突之神在不朽者之间的战斗中灭亡。它的身体漂浮在星界中，最终变成了一具石化的躯壳。这具尸体漂浮到了一块珍珠般的残余天体上，充满了生命和赋予生命的魔法。碰撞使两个物体都破碎了，并释放出一股混乱的能量风暴。无数混合物质的岛屿在银色虚空中飞散。在其中一些岛屿中，一条像珍珠一样的物质蕴含着一点神力复苏的超自然活力，自发地创造出了一个宜居的环境。在这些岛屿上，神的石化肉体的碎片以触手怪物的形式复活，充满了恶意和贪婪。从那时起，每个莫科斯都有一个外域岛屿可称之为家园。",
	"A morkoth's island has the qualities of a dreamscape in which nature and predictability take a back seat to strangeness and chaos. Upon it is a jumble of objects and a mixture of creatures, some of which date from forgotten times.

To meet their need to navigate great distances, the neogi first dominated and assimilated the umber hulks of another lost world.

	"A neogi lives about as long as a human, and like a human it faces physical and mental infirmity as it ages. When an individual is rendered weak by advanced age, the other neogi in the group overpower it and inject it with a special poison.

Under normal circumstances, any tadpole that grows larger than a few inches in length is killed by the elder brain to be food for it or for less mature tadpoles. Any tadpole that survives beyond that state is perceived as a threat to the colony, and the mind flayers organize hunting parties to exterminate the abomination. Lacking enough intelligence to be detected by an elder brain's power to sense thoughts, neothelids warrant such precautions.": "在厄利希德社会中最严重的禁忌之一是允许一个成熟的蝌蚪在没有植入供体大脑的情况下存活。在正常情况下，任何长大到几英寸长的蝌蚪都会被老脑杀死，作为它或不够成熟的蝌蚪的食物。任何能够存活超过那个阶段的蝌蚪都被视为对殖民地的威胁，而脑食人魔会组织狩猎队来消灭这种畸形。由于缺乏足够的智力无法被老脑的思维感应能力检测到，新生脑虫需要采取这样的预防措施。",

	"When goblinoids form a host, there is a chance that a goblin will become possessed by a nilbog, particularly if the goblin has been mistreated by its betters. This possession turns the goblin into a wisecracking, impish creature fearless of reprisal. It gives the goblin strange powers that drive others to do the opposite of what they desire. Attacking a goblin possessed by a nilbog is foolhardy, and killing the creature just prompts the spirit to possess another goblin.
