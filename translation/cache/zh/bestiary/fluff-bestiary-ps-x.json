	"Aerosaurs include several varieties of large reptiles with leathery wings, including pterodons and sunwings. Though they are generally clumsy fliers, better at gliding from high perches or riding coastal updrafts than at lifting themselves from the ground, aerosaurs are sometimes used as mounts by knights of the Sun Empire.": "Aerosaurs包括几个品种的具有皮革翅膀的大型爬行动物，包括翼龙和太阳翼。虽然它们通常是笨拙的飞行者，更擅长从高处的栖息地滑翔或乘坐海岸的上升气流，而不是从地面上抬起自己，但太阳帝国的骑士们有时会将航空龙作为坐骑。",
	"Armasaurs also have plates on their backs, but these rise up like spikes along their spines. Their whiplike tails bear sharp spikes for protection.": "犰狳的背上也有板块，但这些板块像尖刺一样沿着它们的脊柱升起。它们的鞭状尾巴上有锋利的尖刺用于保护。",
	"The largest of the dinosaurs are huge, long-necked herbi vores that feed on the leaves of tall trees. The enormous size of these dinosaurs means that a single beast—often a young, old, or injured one that becomes separated from the herd—can feed a whole pack of smaller preda tors. The magnificent altisaurs wander across the plains and through the sparse forests of the Sun Coast, grazing on the tops of trees. Brontodons travel in herds, causing the ground to thunder beneath their tremendous weight when they build up speed.": "最大的恐龙是巨大的、长颈的herbi vores，以高大树木的叶子为食。这些恐龙的巨大体型意味着一只野兽--通常是一只年轻的、年老的或受伤的、与兽群分离的野兽--就可以养活一整群较小的猎手。雄伟的高脚龙在平原上和太阳海岸的稀疏森林中游荡，在树顶上吃草。雷龙成群结队地旅行，当它们的速度加快时，地面在它们巨大的重量下发出雷鸣般的声音。",
	"Many smaller herbivores are found on the plains of Ix alan. Rather than depending on size for defense, these dinosaurs are protected by plated scales, sharp horns, or spiked tails. Most are aggressively proactive in chas ing off predators even before they are attacked, and the people of the Sun Empire find these creatures among the hardest dinosaurs to control.": "在Ix alan的平原上发现了许多较小的食草动物。这些恐龙并不依靠体型进行防御，而是由镀金的鳞片、尖锐的角或带刺的尾巴来保护。大多数恐龙甚至在被攻击之前就积极主动地追赶掠食者，太阳帝国的人民发现这些生物是最难控制的恐龙之一，当它们建立起速度的时候。",

Despite their surly temper, ceratopses make excellent mounts.": "角龙在保护其颈部的大型羽毛状褶皱上和周围都有巨大的角。相关的短角缺乏其表亲的尖锐的角。尽管角龙脾气暴躁，但它们是优秀的坐骑。",
	"Indescribable creatures of nightmare lurk in the ruins and dark places of Ixalan. Many are thought to be the corrupted remnants of the life energy and brilliant light left behind in places the Sun Empire has abandoned.

	"Coatls are immortal guardians of the sky, dwelling always among the clouds. The River Heralds say that they can be enticed to the ground by the earnest supplication of the wisest of merfolk shamans. Coatls are said to be wise beyond mortal measure and incapable of speaking a falsehood, so their advice is often sought in times of desperate need. The sight of a coatl is thought to foretell favorable winds—a belief that has begun to spread from the River Herald shamans to the pirates of the Brazen Coalition.": "大衣哥是天空的不朽守护者，一直居住在云层中。河流预言家们说，只要最聪明的人鱼族巫师真诚地祈求，就能把它们引到地面上来。据说Coatls的智慧超乎凡人，而且不会说假话，所以在急需的时候经常会征求他们的意见。人们认为，看到Coatl会预示着顺风，这种信念已经开始从先驱河的巫师们传播到布拉格联盟的海盗们。",

	"Resembling twisted bats, the demons of Ixalan are the spawn of a bat-god, the source of all darkness. While the sun's aspects include destruction as well as creation and growth, the demons represent stagnation and decay. The sun consumes in glorious fire; demons work through rot and degeneration. They are said to be active at night, when the sun is hidden, and their efforts are directed toward preventing the sun from rising again each morning. In the meantime, they spread plague and corruption across the land.": "伊克萨兰的恶魔类似于扭曲的蝙蝠，是蝙蝠之神的后代，是所有黑暗的源头。太阳的方面包括毁灭以及创造和成长，而恶魔则代表着停滞和腐烂。太阳在光辉的火焰中消耗；恶魔则通过腐烂和堕落来工作。据说它们在夜间活动，这时太阳被隐藏起来，它们的努力方向是阻止太阳在每天早晨再次升起。同时，他们在整个土地上传播瘟疫和腐败。",
	"It is said that the only force on Ixalan not interested in finding the golden city is Ixalan itself. Dryads, as incarnations of the land and its will, prove the saying true. Their only concern is the health of the forest: when the trees and ferns are healthy, the dryads flourish. But when the vampires' dusk fog or a demon's unwholesome influence cause the jungle to wither, the dryads suffer. As a result, they are generally friendly with the River Heralds, who live in harmony with nature, and hostile to the Legion of Dusk.": "据说伊萨兰上唯一对寻找黄金城不感兴趣的势力就是伊萨兰本身。干尸，作为土地和土地意志的化身，证明了这句话的真实性。他们唯一关心的是森林的健康：当树木和蕨类植物健康时，干尸就会蓬勃发展。但当吸血鬼的黄昏之雾或恶魔的不健康影响导致丛林枯萎时，干尸们就会受到影响。因此，他们通常对与自然和谐共处的河流先驱者很友好，而对穿越土地的黄昏军团则充满敌意。",
	"The dryads otherwise have no stake in the conflict between the people of Ixalan and the invaders, but as creatures of life and growth, they hate to see any living being suffer. Thus, they have been known to tend to wounded people left in the jungle to die, sharing their own abundant life energy with those in their care.": "在Ixalan人民和入侵者之间的冲突中，干尸没有任何利害关系，但作为生命和成长的生物，他们讨厌看到任何生物受苦。因此，他们已经知道要照顾被留在丛林中死去的伤员，与那些被他们照顾的人分享自己丰富的生命能量。",
	"The opening of Orazca, the golden city—which marks the turn between the Ixalan set and Rivals of Ixalan—reveals the existence of six huge and ancient elder dinosaurs, apparently preserved for centuries. Compared to their smaller cousins, they have less brightly-colored plumage and more grayish scales, but their feathers are a bright gold that matches the city around them. They are strong-willed and ferocious, and thus are hard to control. But the power of the Immortal Sun gives the Sun Empire warriors who wield it the ability to bring these elder dinosaurs under their command.": "黄金城奥拉兹卡的开场--它标志着《伊克萨兰集》和《伊克萨兰的对手》之间的转折--揭示了六只巨大而古老的老年恐龙的存在，显然是保存了几个世纪。与它们较小的表亲相比，它们的羽翼没有那么鲜艳，而更多的是灰色的鳞片，但它们的羽毛是明亮的金色，与它们周围的城市相匹配。它们意志坚强，性格凶猛，因此很难控制。但不朽的太阳的力量使挥舞着太阳帝国的战士们有能力将这些年长的恐龙置于他们的指挥之下。",
	"Ferocidons are particularly vicious relatives of raptors, specialized to take down much larger prey.": "Ferocidons是猛禽的特别凶恶的亲戚，专门用来对付更大的猎物。拥有这种能力的战士可以将这些年长的恐龙置于他们的指挥之下。",

They are intelligent and noble, and they share the River Heralds' desire to ensure that the power of the Immortal Sun is never again unleashed on the world.": "色彩斑斓的狮鹫结合了丛林鹦鹉的头和羽毛以及美洲虎的光滑身体。它们聪明而高贵，它们与先驱河的愿望相同，即确保不朽的太阳的力量永远不会再释放到世界上。",
	"Some herbivores rely on speed, stealth, or numbers to aid their chances of survival. The Hadrosaur is a good example of such creatures.": "一些食草动物依靠速度、隐蔽性或数量来帮助它们获得生存机会。蛇龙是这种生物的一个很好的例子。",

	"Harpies are the mortal servants of demons, and they resemble them in their general features. Their faces are like those of owls, and they have large, feathered wings that suggest their corrupt connection to the Sun Empire—or perhaps their heritage as sirens who were corrupted by the evil of the demons. Utterly nasty in temperament, harpies inhabit many of the islands in both the Stormwreck Sea and the Inner Sea, and dwell on high cliffs on the mainland of Ixalan. Their filthy bodies carry disease that they can spread through their bite.": "女妖是恶魔的凡人仆人，她们的一般特征与恶魔相似。他们的脸就像猫头鹰，他们有巨大的、带羽毛的翅膀，这表明他们与太阳帝国有腐败的联系--或者也许他们的遗产是被恶魔的邪恶所腐蚀的海妖。在性情上完全讨厌的哈比人居住在风暴残骸海和内海的许多岛屿上，并居住在伊萨兰大陆的高崖上。它们肮脏的身体携带着疾病，可以通过它们的叮咬传播。",

They range from tiny poisonous tree frogs found in the branches of tall trees to huge horned frogs that lurk in marshy areas.": "在艾克萨兰，青蛙的声音比看到的更常见，它们的声音与丛林中生动的声景结合在一起。它们的范围很广，从高大树枝上的小毒树蛙到潜伏在沼泽地里的巨大角蛙，它们可以通过咬人来传播。",
	"A wide variety of native birds are found throughout Ixalan, singing complex songs that contribute to the chorus of sounds within the jungle. Hummingbirds are sometimes poetically described as embodiments of freedom and the pursuit of pleasure. Large macaws and parrots make their homes in the trees and can often be found gathering over clay licks along riverbeds and the sea coast. The wily birds enjoy toying with people from the trees, with many of them calling out in imitation of humanoid voices to lead pirates and other explorers astray.": "各种各样的本地鸟类在整个艾克萨兰被发现，它们唱着复杂的歌曲，为丛林中的声音合唱做出贡献。蜂鸟有时被诗意地描述为自由和追求快乐的化身。大型金刚鹦鹉在树上安家，经常可以发现它们聚集在河床和海岸边的粘土上。这些狡猾的鸟儿喜欢在树上玩弄人，其中许多鸟儿模仿人的声音叫喊，把海盗和其他探险者引入歧途。",

	"Through the years in which the Sun Empire was ruled from Orazca, its priests crafted huge stone guardians to protect the empire's cities and temples. The incredible magic of the Immortal Sun gave a semblance of life to these artificial creatures, endowing them with the ability to move their stone bodies, a keen awareness of their surroundings, and a limited ability to think and reason in order to help them carry out their orders. These stone guardians were tasked with standing watch—constantly alert, vigilant to any danger, never sleeping, and unswerving in their duty.": "在太阳帝国被奥拉兹卡统治的这些年里，其祭司们制作了巨大的石头守护者来保护帝国的城市和神庙。不朽的太阳的不可思议的魔力给这些人造生物带来了生命的迹象，赋予他们移动石头身体的能力，对周围环境的敏锐意识，以及有限的思考和推理能力，以帮助他们执行命令。这些石头守护者的任务是站岗放哨--时刻保持警惕，对任何危险保持警觉，从不睡觉，并坚定不移地履行职责。",
	"Most stone guardians are inactive now. In ancient ruins lying far from the old capital, the magic that gave them life has faded over the centuries. Even within the golden city, many of them have become inert, and those who seek to explore Orazca or other ancient ruins must be on constant guard. Any carved figure or statue might well be a stone guardian whose magic has failed. But it might also be a guardian that is simply waiting for a threat before it activates and drives that threat away.": "大多数石头守护者现在都不活跃。在远离旧都的古老遗迹中，赋予他们生命的魔法在几个世纪中已经消逝。即使在黄金城内，他们中的许多人也变得没有活力，那些试图探索奥拉兹卡或其他古代遗迹的人必须时刻保持警惕。任何雕刻的人物或雕像都很可能是魔法失效的石头守护者。但它也可能是一个守护者，它只是在等待威胁，然后激活并赶走威胁。它对任何危险保持警惕，从不睡觉，坚定不移地履行职责。",
	"The people of the Sun Empire revere certain dinosaurs as incarnations of the Threefold Sun. But the fiery phoenixes, also called sunbirds, are thought to be messengers of Tilonalli, embodying the destructive aspect of the sun but also the rebirth that follows.

Xuatl molts its skin and feathers during the summer months, often setting the trees and slopes ablaze.": "太阳帝国的人民崇尚某些恐龙，认为它们是三倍太阳的化身。但火红的凤凰，也叫太阳鸟，被认为是蒂罗纳利的使者，体现了太阳的破坏性，但也体现了随之而来的重生。传说中，在山脉的某个地方沉睡着Xuatl--一只由太阳之火形成的有鳞鸟。Xuatl在夏季蜕去皮肤和羽毛，经常将树木和山坡点燃，他们不畏危险，从不睡觉，坚定不移地履行职责。",
	"Elementals are an even more primal embodiment of natural forces. They are living beings of raw natural energy, but magic can shape and bind them into physical forms composed of wind, water, fire, or the verdant growth of the forest. The River Heralds construct jade totems that hold elementals in stasis until activated by trespassers. When a totem opens, the elemental's physical form comes together, and the intruders are quickly dispatched.": "元素是自然力量的一个更原始的体现。他们是原始自然能量的生命体，但魔法可以将他们塑造成由风、水、火或森林的葱郁生长组成的物理形态。河流预言家们建造了玉石图腾，在闯入者激活之前，将元素保持在静止状态。当图腾打开时，元素的身体形态就会聚集起来，入侵者就会被迅速驱散。",

Fire guardians are similar to {@creature fire elemental|MM|fire elementals}.": "在{@book Monster Manual|MM}中，各种元素和植物生物都可以代表伊克沙兰的元素生物。 河流先知的图腾元素类似于基本的{@creature air elemental|MM|air}，{@creature earth elemental|MM|earth}和{@creature water elemental|MM|water elementals}，或者类似于{@creature treant|MM|treants}，枯萎物，{@creature shambling mound|MM|shambling mounds}或{@creature awakened tree|MM|awakened trees}和{@creature awakened shrub|MM|awakened shrubs}。 火焰守护者类似于{@creature fire elemental|MM|fire elementals}。",
	"Ixalan's largest predators comprise a family of dinosaurs with large heads, blade-like teeth, and short, almost vestigial front legs. These terrifying creatures bear names like monstrosaurs, dreadmaws, swordtooths, regisaurs, and tyrants, and their roars inspire terror in those who hear them. Most of these dinosaurs are solitary hunters, but regisaurs in particular are known for hunting in small packs. Use the {@creature tyrannosaurus rex|MM} statistics in the {@book Monster Manual|MM} for all these giant predators.": "Ixalan（伊萨朗）最大的掠食者包括一类头部巨大、利刃般的牙齿和短小、近乎退化的前肢的恐龙家族。这些可怕的生物被命名为怪兽龙（monstrosaurs）、恐惧颚（dreadmaws）、剑齿兽（swordtooths）、暴君龙（regisaurs）和暴君（tyrants），它们的咆哮让听到的人感到恐惧。大多数这些恐龙都是独自狩猎，但尤其是暴君龙以小群体狩猎而闻名。对于所有这些巨型掠食者，请使用{@creature tyrannosaurus rex|MM}中的统计数据。"
