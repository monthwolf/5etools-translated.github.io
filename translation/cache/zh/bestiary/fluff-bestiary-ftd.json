	"Amethyst dragons, the mightiest of the gem dragons, study and psionically manipulate the fundamental principles of the multiverse, from the force of gravity to the emanations of the Outer Planes. Their innate psionics give them a measure of control over how physical laws affect them. They defy gravity with flight that doesn't rely solely upon their great wings, and gravitational force empowers both their devastating breath weapon and the exploding amethyst crystals they spit at their foes.": "紫晶龙，最强大的宝石龙，研究并幻化操纵多元宇宙的基本原理，从引力到外层星球的发散。他们与生俱来的幻术使他们能够在一定程度上控制物理法则如何影响他们。他们藐视重力的飞行并不完全依靠他们巨大的翅膀，引力赋予他们毁灭性的呼吸武器和他们向敌人吐出的爆炸性紫晶晶体。",
	"When first hatched, an amethyst dragon has scales of dull, opaque purple. As the dragon grows, their scales, horns, and wing membranes become more vibrant and translucent. When the dragon is fully mature, their scales resemble rich purple amethyst crystals, refracting light to take on an inner glow. Their pupils fade with age, making the eyes of an ancient dragon resemble glowing white or pale lavender orbs. Crystalline horns reminiscent of amethyst chunks hover behind their heads, held there by telekinetic force and shifting with their moods.": "刚孵化时，紫晶龙的鳞片是暗淡的、不透明的紫色。随着龙的成长，它们的鳞片、角和翼膜变得更加鲜艳和半透明。当龙完全成熟时，它们的鳞片就像丰富的紫色紫水晶，折射光线，呈现出内在的光芒。它们的瞳孔会随着年龄的增长而褪色，使古龙的眼睛像发光的白色或淡淡的淡紫色球体。让人联想到紫水晶块的结晶角盘旋在他们的脑后，由心灵感应的力量固定在那里，并随着他们的情绪变化而变化。",
	"Many amethyst dragons are fascinated by the existence of other worlds in the Material Plane, and especially the way individual dragons manifest unique echoes across those worlds. They also prize understanding of the cosmic forces that emanate from the Outer Planes, studying the opposing tides of good and evil, chaos and order, so they can offer counsel to those with the wisdom to accept it.": "许多紫晶龙对物质世界中其他世界的存在很着迷，尤其是个别龙在这些世界中表现出独特的回声。他们也珍视对来自外部世界的宇宙力量的理解，研究善与恶、混乱与秩序的对立潮汐，因此他们可以向那些有智慧的人提供建议，以接受它。",
	"Amethyst dragons pay particular attention to intrusions of the Far Realm into the Material Plane. They loathe the corruption that accompanies such intrusions into the world, making them fierce opponents of the Far Realm and any creatures warped by its touch. Strangely, though, they are intrigued by and fond of flumphs. These Aberrations, which oppose the depredations of mind flayers and other wicked Aberrations, remind amethyst dragons that allies can be found in the strangest places.": "紫晶龙特别关注远界对物质世界的入侵。他们厌恶伴随着这种入侵世界的腐败，这使他们成为远界和任何被其扭曲的生物的激烈对手。但奇怪的是，他们对浮游生物很感兴趣，也很喜欢。这些反常者反对掠夺心灵的人和其他邪恶的反常者，提醒紫晶龙，在最奇怪的地方也能找到盟友。",
	"In addition to material wealth, amethyst dragons delight in collecting knowledge and magic dealing with the nature of the planes of existence, cosmic forces, and distant worlds. They prize treasures drawn from different worlds of the Material Plane, especially magic items and artworks that highlight the unique nature of different worlds. Magic items that allow teleportation or travel between planes, spellbooks filled with similar magic, and treatises examining the nature of the multiverse form the centerpiece of an amethyst dragon's hoard.": "除了物质财富之外，紫晶龙还乐于收集涉及存在平面的性质、宇宙力量和遥远世界的知识和魔法。他们珍视从物质世界的不同世界汲取的宝物，尤其是突出不同世界独特性质的魔法物品和艺术品。允许传送或在不同位面之间旅行的魔法物品、充满类似魔法的法术书，以及研究多元宇宙性质的论文，构成了紫晶龙囤积的核心。",
	"Amethyst dragons make their lairs in caves next to or under secluded pools and lakes, preferring caverns with at least one entrance submerged underwater. They prize locations with a combination of open space, connecting tunnels, and dead ends to make the most of their natural and magical mobility, using flight and teleportation to navigate obstacles in their lairs.": "紫晶龙在隐蔽的池塘和湖泊旁边或下面的洞穴中筑巢，更喜欢至少有一个入口浸在水下的洞穴。它们喜欢有开放空间、连接通道和死胡同的地方，以充分利用其自然和魔法的流动性，利用飞行和传送来驾驭其巢穴中的障碍。",
	"The challenge rating of a legendary amethyst dragon increases by 1 when it's encountered in its lair.": "在传说中的紫水晶龙的巢穴中遇到它时，其挑战等级增加1。",
	"Shimmering with radiant energy and brimming with life, crystal dragons enjoy an innate psionic connection to the Positive Plane that suffuses their bodies as well as their personalities with light. Though they prefer to live in desolate, frigid regions, many of them are among the friendliest of dragonkind, nurturing and optimistic.": "水晶龙闪烁着璀璨的能量，充满了生命力，它们享有与生俱来的与正面世界的幻觉联系，使它们的身体和个性都充满了光。虽然它们喜欢生活在荒凉、寒冷的地区，但它们中的许多人都是龙族中最友好的人，具有养育和乐观的精神。",
	"When they hatch, crystal dragons have dull gray scales, with a few white or clear crystalline points, allowing the wyrmlings to blend in to rocky terrain in the face of danger. As they age, their scales turn snow white, then slowly fade to transparency. The oldest crystal dragons have scales of perfect clarity that bend and refract light, sometimes making them difficult to see clearly.": "孵化时，水晶龙的鳞片是暗灰色的，有一些白色或透明的结晶点，使巫妖在面对危险时能够融入岩石地带。随着年龄的增长，它们的鳞片会变成雪白色，然后慢慢褪去，变成透明。最古老的水晶龙拥有完美清晰的鳞片，可以弯曲和折射光线，有时使它们难以看清。",
	"The radiant energy of the Positive Plane shimmers in crystal dragons' scales. It glows like starlight between their bodies and the spines and horns that hover close to their heads and backs. These horns shift with the dragon's mood: bristling with anger, lying back with fear or suspicion, and rippling in side-to-side waves with amusement or joy.": "正位面的辐射能量在水晶龙的鳞片中闪闪发光。它像星光一样在它们的身体和盘旋在它们头部和背部附近的刺和角之间闪耀。这些角会随着龙的情绪而变化：愤怒的时候鬃毛竖起，恐惧或怀疑的时候向后躺下，娱乐或快乐的时候向两边荡漾开来。",
	"Many crystal dragons study the stars, recording their observations of the night sky and tracking the signs written in starlight. They read these signs as omens, giving them glimpses of what is to come, and they eagerly examine the potential futures of any creatures who come to them in peace.": "许多水晶龙研究星星，记录他们对夜空的观察，追踪写在星光中的迹象。他们把这些征兆看成是预兆，让他们瞥见即将发生的事情，他们热切地研究任何和平地来到他们身边的生物的潜在未来。",
	"Crystal dragons' connection to the radiant forces of the Positive Plane fosters a nurturing, optimistic attitude in most of these dragons. They sometimes adopt the abandoned eggs or hatchlings of other dragons; many a white wyrmling has been raised in the caring environment of a crystal dragon's lair. But they fiercely oppose destructive forces in their home territories, which sometimes leads nearby frost giants and white dragons to put aside their mutual enmity to hunt them.": "水晶龙与正面世界的辐射力量的联系培养了大多数这些龙的养育和乐观的态度。它们有时会收养其他龙的弃蛋或幼崽；许多白鲸都是在水晶龙巢穴的关爱环境中长大的。但它们激烈地反对其家乡领地的破坏性力量，这有时会导致附近的冰霜巨龙和白龙放下彼此的敌意来猎杀它们。",
	"For their treasure hoards, crystal dragons prize diamonds and baubles that refract light, collections of prophecy, works on astronomy, and star charts. When it comes to magical treasure, they seek items and spells that predict the future, create or manipulate light, or channel positive energy for healing and nurturing.": "对于他们的宝藏，水晶龙喜欢钻石和能折射光线的饰品、预言集、天文学作品和星图。当涉及到魔法宝藏时，他们寻求能预测未来的物品和咒语，创造或操纵光线，或引导正能量进行治疗和培育。",
	"Crystal dragons dwell in cold regions, where they construct ice and snow structures reminiscent of castles but open to the sky. Glittering crystals scattered about their lairs glow with gathered starlight, and caves or tunnels beneath the ice and snow provide protected areas for their hoards. They use their burrowing ability to dig blinds and secret passages throughout their lairs, allowing them to move easily—and potentially unnoticed.": "水晶龙居住在寒冷地区，它们在那里建造冰雪结构，让人联想到城堡，但却向天空开放。散落在巢穴中的闪闪发光的水晶在聚集的星光下熠熠生辉，冰雪下的洞穴或隧道为它们的族群提供了保护区域。它们利用自己的钻洞能力在巢穴中挖掘百叶窗和秘密通道，使它们能够轻松移动，而且可能不被发现。",
	"The challenge rating of a legendary crystal dragon increases by 1 when it's encountered in its lair.": "在传奇水晶龙的巢穴中遇到它时，其挑战等级会增加1。",
	"Making their lairs in the depths of the Underdark, deep dragons are nightmarish cousins of chromatic dragons. The warped magical energy of their subterranean realm gives them the ability to exhale magical spores that instill fear and scar the mind.": "深海龙在地下世界的深处筑巢，是色龙的噩梦般的表兄弟。他们的地下世界的扭曲的魔法能量使他们有能力呼出魔法孢子，灌输恐惧，使人心灵受伤。",
	"Deep dragons' black-and-gray hide is smooth like a salamander's, and their eyes are pale. As they age, their spore breath causes fungi to bloom across their skin, especially around the head and neck. Their wings are attached to their front legs and can fold in close to the body, allowing deep dragons to easily maneuver through relatively narrow tunnels.": "深龙的黑灰色皮肤像蝾螈一样光滑，它们的眼睛很苍白。随着它们的年龄增长，它们的孢子气息会使真菌在它们的皮肤上绽放，尤其是在头部和颈部周围。它们的翅膀连接在前腿上，可以紧贴身体折叠，使深海龙能够轻松地在相对狭窄的隧道中穿梭。",
	"Deep dragons often hoard secrets, delighting in knowledge of far-off lands. Many seek out new insights and tricks that they can use against other denizens of the Underdark, preferring social manipulation and crafty dealmaking to exerting themselves in combat. Deep dragons look down on any creature that isn't useful to them, though they are willing to bargain for knowledge they lack.": "深海巨龙经常囤积秘密，对遥远的土地的知识感到高兴。许多人寻求新的见解和技巧，以便用来对付暗黑世界的其他居民，他们更喜欢社会操纵和狡猾的交易，而不是在战斗中施展自己。深海龙看不起任何对他们没有用处的生物，尽管他们愿意为自己缺乏的知识讨价还价。",
	"Deep dragons make their lairs in well-hidden caves or sunless beaches in the Underdark, and these sites are often inaccessible without the ability to fly or dive underwater. They fill their lairs with secret passages and hiding places that allow them to escape or ambush visitors if the need arises. A well-cultivated lair abounds with Underdark fungi and plants, with the floor, walls, and ceiling covered in carpets of mold and moss, or featuring larger mushrooms and plants in neatly organized displays.": "深海龙将它们的巢穴建在暗黑世界中隐蔽的洞穴或没有阳光的海滩上，如果没有飞行或水下潜水的能力，这些地方通常是无法进入的。它们在巢穴中布满了秘密通道和藏身之处，以便在需要时逃跑或伏击访客。一个精心培育的巢穴里有大量的暗黑真菌和植物，地板、墙壁和天花板上覆盖着霉菌和苔藓的地毯，或者整齐地陈列着较大的蘑菇和植物。",
	"The challenge rating of a legendary deep dragon increases by 1 when it's encountered in its lair.": "在传奇深渊龙的巢穴中遇到它时，其挑战等级增加1。",
	"Emerald dragons are the most curious, cunning, and manipulative of the gem dragons, wielding psionic power to weave illusions to deceive and disorient. They cloak their own presence so they can observe other creatures without being discovered as they collect information on everything from local cultural practices to supernatural occurrences.": "翡翠龙是最好奇、最狡猾、最善于操纵的宝石龙，它们挥舞着幻象的力量来欺骗和迷惑他人。他们隐藏自己的存在，以便在收集从当地文化习俗到超自然现象的各种信息时，可以观察其他生物而不被发现。",
	"A wyrmling emerald dragon's scales are a dull, pale green, but they develop into richer and more varied shades of green as the dragon ages. Eventually, the scales become translucent and shimmer in the light, rippling as the dragon moves. The dragon's horns and spines hover above the body, moving and shifting along the back and tail to mirror the dragon's mood.": "翡翠龙的鳞片是一种暗淡的淡绿色，但随着龙的年龄增长，它们会发展成更丰富、更多样的绿色。最终，鳞片变成半透明的，在光线下闪闪发光，随着龙的移动而荡漾。龙的角和刺盘旋在身体上方，沿着背部和尾部移动和变换，以反映龙的情绪。",
	"The shyest of the gem dragons, emerald dragons are also the most curious. They love to observe local settlements and peoples, using their psionic abilities to cloak themselves and watch from afar. When an emerald dragon is old enough, the dragon might take on the guise of a creature that can blend in with the local population, or at least get close without arousing suspicion. Once in a position to observe, the dragon studies the day-to-day life of local folk, with a keen interest in any magical phenomena.": "绿宝石龙是最害羞的宝石龙，也是最有好奇心的。它们喜欢观察当地的定居点和人民，利用它们的幻觉能力来隐蔽自己，从远处观察。当翡翠龙足够大的时候，它可能会伪装成一种可以混入当地人口的生物，或者至少可以接近而不引起怀疑。一旦进入观察状态，龙就会研究当地人的日常生活，并对任何神奇的现象产生浓厚的兴趣。",
	"Emerald dragons' attentiveness to unusual events makes them particularly useful to their sapphire dragon cousins, who hunt down Aberrations and seek evidence of Far Realm incursions into the Material Plane. These gem dragons often work together, with emerald dragons tracking the source of an incursion while sapphire dragons plan and execute a decisive purge—or recruit agents to do it for them.": "绿宝石龙对不寻常事件的关注使它们对它们的蓝宝石龙表亲特别有用，后者追捕异端并寻找远界入侵物质界的证据。这些宝石龙经常一起工作，绿宝石龙追踪入侵的源头，而蓝宝石龙则计划并执行决定性的清除行动，或者招募代理人为其工作。",
	"Emerald dragons' preference for volcanic lairs often puts them in conflict with fire giants. Despite their reluctance to reveal themselves to strangers, emerald dragons might approach experienced adventurers in the hopes of pitting them against fire giant rivals.": "绿宝石龙对火山巢穴的偏爱常常使它们与火巨人发生冲突。尽管他们不愿意向陌生人暴露自己，但翡翠龙可能会接近有经验的冒险家，希望能让他们与火巨人的对手对决。",
	"Emerald dragons prize knowledge, particularly local histories that focus on magical events and individuals. They usually know of places of power near their lairs and keep detailed records of how phenomena connected to those sites react to outside influences. They also avidly collect magic items and spells that create illusions, allowing them to better conceal their treasures from prying eyes and divinations.": "翡翠龙重视知识，尤其是专注于魔法事件和个人的地方历史。他们通常知道自己巢穴附近的权力场所，并详细记录与这些场所有关的现象对外界影响的反应。他们还热衷于收集魔法物品和创造幻觉的法术，使他们能够更好地隐藏他们的宝藏，避免被窥视和占卜。",
	"Emerald dragons dwell in enormous caverns, lava tubes, and tunnel networks deep within the earth. They favor warm spaces, particularly in volcanic regions. Over time, their psychic presence seeps into the land surrounding their lairs, expanding their awareness and subconsciously luring their favorite food—giant lizards—to settle and thrive in the region.": "翡翠龙居住在地球深处的巨大洞穴、熔岩管道和隧道网络中。它们喜欢温暖的空间，尤其是在火山地区。随着时间的推移，它们的精神存在渗入它们巢穴周围的土地，扩大它们的意识，并下意识地引诱它们最喜欢的食物--巨型蜥蜴在该地区定居和繁衍。",
	"Emerald dragons use the features of their lairs to confuse and imperil intruders. They dig additional tunnels that allow them to move through their lairs in multiple ways and set traps leading to yawning chasms or pools and flows of lava.": "翡翠龙利用其巢穴的特点来迷惑和威胁入侵者。它们挖掘额外的隧道，使它们能够以多种方式在巢穴中移动，并设置陷阱，将其引向巨大的鸿沟或熔岩池和熔岩流。",
	"Emerald dragons take great pains to hide the chambers that house their hoards and collected lore, often using illusion magic and subtle construction around the natural features of their lairs to conceal their central hoard chambers from mundane and magical sight.": "翡翠龙不遗余力地隐藏存放其囤积物和收集的传说的房间，经常使用幻觉魔法和围绕其巢穴的自然特征的微妙结构来掩盖其中央囤积物的房间，不被世俗和魔法所发现。",
	"The challenge rating of a legendary emerald dragon increases by 1 when it's encountered in its lair.": "当传奇绿宝石龙在其巢穴中遇到时，其挑战等级会增加1。",
	"Ancient legends suggest that when the gods came to the First World and tried to populate it with their Humanoid followers, a clever dragon fled to the Feywild to hide a clutch of eggs. The magic of that faerie realm suffused the eggs, which hatched into the first moonstone dragons. Their descendants are now found throughout the Feywild.": "古老的传说表明，当诸神来到第一世界并试图用他们的类人信徒来填充它时，一条聪明的龙逃到了精灵世界，藏起了一窝蛋。精灵界的魔法充斥着这些蛋，它们孵化成了第一批月石龙。它们的后代现在在整个仙境中都能找到。",
	"Moonstone dragons are graceful and elegant creatures with opalescent scales and ruffs of emerald-green fur running down their chins, chests, backs, and tails. One horn arcs from the back of a moonstone dragon's skull and another at the tip of the nose; the two horns together form a shape that's reminiscent of a slender crescent moon. Moonstone dragons are playful and impetuous forces of mischief in their early years, but the best of them mature into wise teachers and storytellers who anchor Feywild communities. The worst of them are pompous and ill behaved, but even those remain gentle by nature and curious about all things—especially travelers from faraway places.": "月光石龙是一种优雅的生物，有着乳白色的鳞片和翡翠绿色的皮毛，沿着下巴、胸部、背部和尾巴延伸。一只角从月光石龙的头骨后面拱出，另一只在鼻尖；两只角一起形成的形状让人联想到一个细长的新月。月光石龙在早期是顽皮和急躁的恶作剧力量，但最好的月光石龙会成熟为睿智的老师和讲故事的人，他们是精灵世界社区的支柱。它们中最坏的是浮夸和行为不端，但即使是这样的龙也保持着温和的天性，对所有事物都很好奇，特别是来自遥远地方的旅行者。",
	"Moonstone dragons can project themselves into the realm of dreams to communicate with the creatures that sleep near their lairs. In this way, they inspire artists and poets, encourage great thinkers, and spur adventurers to heroic deeds. They sometimes give guidance to those in need or request help from adventurers to encourage them to greatness.": "月光石龙可以将自己投射到梦境中，与睡在它们巢穴附近的生物交流。通过这种方式，它们激励艺术家和诗人，鼓励伟大的思想家，并刺激冒险家做出英雄事迹。他们有时会给那些需要帮助的人提供指导，或者请求冒险者的帮助，以鼓励他们走向伟大。",
	"As a rule, moonstone dragons are not particularly interested in gold or copper, but they love silver, platinum, and mithral. They also cherish treasures whose value can't be easily quantified—a song sung from the heart, a lock of a loved one's hair, or a painting of a favorite place. A story of happy times fondly remembered is more precious to a moonstone dragon than a sack of gold.": "通常，月光石龙对金或铜并不特别感兴趣，但它们喜欢银、铂金和密特拉。他们也珍视那些价值不容易被量化的宝物--一首发自内心的歌，一绺爱人的头发，或者一幅最喜欢的地方的画。对月光石龙来说，一个深情回忆的快乐时光的故事比一袋黄金更珍贵。",
	"For their lairs, moonstone dragons look for places kissed by the moon; lonely peaks, forest clearings, and placid lakes are among their favorite sites. Their whimsical nature makes them more likely than other dragons to establish multiple lairs even at a young age. They link their scattered sites with magic portals, often splitting their time between the Feywild, the Material Plane, and the Ethereal Plane.": "对于他们的巢穴，月光石龙寻找被月亮亲吻的地方；孤独的山峰、森林空地和平静的湖泊是他们最喜欢的地方。他们异想天开的天性使他们比其他龙更有可能建立多个巢穴，甚至在年轻的时候。它们用魔法传送门将分散的地点连接起来，经常在精灵世界、物质世界和虚无世界之间分配时间。",
	"The challenge rating of a legendary moonstone dragon increases by 1 when it's encountered in its lair.": "在传奇月石龙的巢穴中遇到它时，其挑战等级增加1。",
	"The thunderous clash of conflict is part of the very nature of sapphire dragons. Militant and territorial, they defend their lairs fiercely, ambushing intruders and plotting assaults against their rivals. The sonic pulse of their breath weapon sows weakness, leaving the victims unable to fight back.": "雷鸣般的冲突是蓝宝石龙本质的一部分。好战和领地性，它们激烈地保卫自己的巢穴，伏击入侵者并策划对对手的攻击。它们的呼吸武器的声波脉冲会造成弱点，使受害者无法反击。",
	"Sapphire dragons' scales and wing membranes show varied shades of blue, ranging from the light tones of a spring sky to the rich, crystalline azure of sapphire gems and compressed glacial ice. In the light, the scales glitter and shine like luminous starbursts. The dragons' psionic nature is evident in the horn and bone structures of their bodies. Their tail barbs and horn tips are all separate pieces, but they float in place, held aloft by psychic energy while the dragons live. These levitating horns and spines shift slightly with the dragons' moods, bobbing in amusement or flaring with anger.": "蓝宝石龙的鳞片和翼膜呈现出不同的蓝色，从春天天空的浅色调到蓝宝石宝石和压缩冰川的丰富、晶莹的蔚蓝色。在灯光下，鳞片闪闪发光，像发光的星光。龙的幻觉性质在它们身体的角和骨结构中是显而易见的。它们的尾巴倒刺和角尖都是独立的部分，但它们漂浮在原地，在龙活着的时候被精神能量托举着。这些漂浮的角和刺会随着龙的情绪而发生轻微的变化，在娱乐中晃动或因愤怒而翻腾。",

A sapphire dragon often refrains from striking immediately, preferring to assess intruders first in order to devise the most advantageous approach to dealing with them.": "好战的蓝宝石龙根据它们在地下的活动能力来制定战略和埋伏。蓝宝石龙通常不会立即出击，而是倾向于先评估入侵者，以便设计出最有利的方法来对付他们。",
	"Sapphire dragons watch for signs of Aberrations and other creatures corrupted by the Far Realm. They frequently ally with emerald dragons, drawing on their kin's knowledge of occult phenomena to track the influence of the Far Realm. Armed with that knowledge, sapphire dragons stamp out alien influence before it spreads.": "蓝宝石龙观察着异教徒和其他被远界腐蚀的生物的迹象。他们经常与绿宝石龙结盟，利用其亲属对神秘现象的知识来追踪远界的影响。掌握了这些知识，蓝宝石龙就能在外来影响扩散之前将其消灭。",
	"People who dwell or delve deep beneath the earth can easily find themselves at odds with a sapphire dragon if they cross into the dragon's territory. But sapphire dragons sometimes forge peaceful relationships with rock gnomes or deep gnomes, relying on these folk to help protect the territory surrounding their lairs.": "居住在地底深处的人，如果进入蓝宝石龙的领地，很容易发现自己与蓝宝石龙发生冲突。但蓝宝石龙有时会与岩石地精或深层地精建立和平关系，依靠这些人帮助保护其巢穴周围的领土。",
	"Sapphire dragons' favorite prizes are weapons and armor, records of military history and tactics, and magic items that protect against psychic damage or mental intrusion. The centerpiece of a sapphire dragon's hoard is usually a cataloged, orderly collection of war gear, which can contain ancient relics of immense power.": "蓝宝石龙最喜欢的奖品是武器和盔甲，军事历史和战术的记录，以及防止精神伤害或精神入侵的魔法物品。蓝宝石龙的囤积物的中心部分通常是有目录的、有序的战争装备收藏，其中可能包含具有巨大力量的古代遗物。",

	"Sapphire dragons make their homes in extensive cave systems. As they grow older, they make increasingly complex renovations to their lairs, using their inherent magic and natural tunneling abilities to great effect. Eventually, a sapphire dragon's lair is a dizzying honeycomb of hidden passages, deceptively thin walls, and secret chambers that allow the dragon to travel from one end to the other unseen by intruders. The most secure lairs might feature no accessible entrances or exits at all, with the dragon relying on tunneling or shaping stone to come and go.": "蓝宝石龙在广泛的洞穴系统中安家。随着年龄的增长，它们对自己的巢穴进行了越来越复杂的改造，利用它们固有的魔法和天然的隧道能力取得了巨大的效果。最终，蓝宝石龙的巢穴是一个令人眼花缭乱的蜂巢，由隐蔽的通道、欺骗性的薄墙和秘密的房间组成，使龙可以在入侵者看不到的情况下从一端走到另一端。最安全的巢穴可能根本没有可进入的入口或出口，龙依靠隧道或塑造石头来来回回。",

	"Decay and despair are bound up in the nature of topaz dragons, thanks to the necrotic energy of the Negative Plane that suffuses them.

	"Upon hatching, topaz dragon wyrmlings' scales are dull yellow-orange and have a cloudy or filmy look. As they age, their scales harden and clarify, becoming translucent and faceted, and ranging from bright yellow to rich amber in color. Their bodies are wider at the haunches, tapering in a wedge shape toward the head, and their wings are shaped to propel them through both air and water. A topaz dragon's psionic power manifests visibly in the gem-like spines that run in a ridge from the crown of the head to the tip of the tail. These spines hover above a living topaz dragon's back, dancing and shifting with the dragon's mood.": "孵化时，黄玉龙巫师的鳞片是暗淡的黄橙色，有一种浑浊或丝状的外观。随着年龄的增长，它们的鳞片会变硬和澄清，变得半透明和有切面，颜色从明亮的黄色到丰富的琥珀色不等。它们的身体在腰部较宽，向头部渐渐变成楔形，翅膀的形状可以推动它们在空中和水中飞行。黄玉龙的幻觉能力明显地体现在从头顶到尾巴尖的宝石般的脊柱上。这些刺盘旋在活的黄玉龙的背上，随着龙的情绪而舞动和变化。",
	"While generally not malicious, topaz dragons embody decay. They view destruction as a natural means of clearing the way for new creation and growth, much as a forest fire clears dead wood, replenishes the soil, and allows the forest to regrow even healthier than before.

	"Despite being competent swimmers and making their lairs on seacoasts and in brackish marshes, topaz dragons hate the water. Unfortunately, their favorite food is giant squid, so these dragons have ample opportunity to complain bitterly about being wet after diving deep into the ocean in search of prey.": "尽管黄玉龙是游泳健将，并在海岸和咸水沼泽地中筑巢，但它们讨厌水。不幸的是，它们最喜欢的食物是巨型乌贼，所以这些龙有足够的机会在潜入海洋深处寻找猎物后痛苦地抱怨自己被淋湿。",
	"Topaz dragons often come into conflict with bronze dragons when their coastal territories overlap, and they can nurture an inexplicably intense hatred of these metallic dragons. They can also draw the ire of druids and other nature protectors who don't understand the dragons' proclivity for destroying large swaths of countryside. Beyond that, topaz dragons dislike company and grow irritated when disturbed. But anyone who can endure their abrasive demeanor, caustic observations, and morbid interests can form a lasting bond with a powerful ally.": "当黄玉龙与青铜龙的沿海地区重叠时，它们经常会与青铜龙发生冲突，而且它们会对这些金属龙产生莫名其妙的强烈憎恨。它们也会引起德鲁伊和其他自然保护者的愤怒，因为他们不理解这些龙破坏大片乡村的倾向性。除此之外，黄玉龙不喜欢有人陪伴，一旦被打扰就会变得很烦躁。但是，任何能够忍受他们粗暴的举止、尖刻的观察和病态的兴趣的人都可以与一个强大的盟友建立持久的联系。",

	"Topaz dragons dwell where the sea meets the land, favoring sites where the constant action of the waves and tides is slowly reducing the land to gravel.

They keep the interior chambers of their lairs meticulously dry.": "黄玉龙居住在大海与陆地的交汇处，喜欢在海浪和潮汐的不断作用下，将陆地慢慢变成碎石的地方。它们把巢穴建在海崖上的洞穴里，或者建在淡水和海水交融的盐沼地下，不断地与它们对水的厌恶作斗争，利用淹没的隧道作为进入它们家园的安全入口。它们保持其巢穴的内部空间一丝不苟地干燥。",

	"As an example, map 5.14 depicts a topaz dragon's lair in a seaside cavern, but it could be reimagined as a grotto in the side of a coral reef rising from a shelf on the ocean floor, with the following features:": "例如，地图5.14描绘了黄玉龙在海边洞穴中的巢穴，但它可以被重新想象成珊瑚礁侧面的石窟，从海底的架子上升起，具有以下特点。",
	"The sandy beaches represent the ocean floor at a depth of 100 feet, which is coated in a soft layer of fine sediment. The water around the lair is clear but dimly lit. The water's edge on the map represents the lip of the shelf, which descends to a dark plain twelve hundred feet below.": "沙滩代表了100英尺深处的海底，它被一层柔软的细小沉积物所覆盖。巢穴周围的水很清澈，但光线很暗。地图上的水边代表大陆架的边缘，它下降到一千二百英尺以下的黑暗平原。",
	"The rocky cliff side depicts the contours of a coral reef that rises 80 feet above the shelf. The exterior face of the reef is covered with stinging corals.": "岩石的悬崖边上描绘了一个珊瑚礁的轮廓，该珊瑚礁高出大陆架80英尺。珊瑚礁的外表面覆盖着刺吸式珊瑚。",
	"The dragon turtle's lair lies in a hollow in the reef's interior that was bored out by a giant sea worm the dragon turtle killed. The original entrance at the level of the shelf floor ascends through a weed-choked tube that opens into the main chamber. Here, the dragon turtle nests in a recessed shelf along the back wall, where the creature can gaze down at the hoard scattered across the chamber floor. Although the lair is mostly flooded with seawater, a layer of breathable air is trapped in the top 3 feet of the main chamber.": "龙龟的巢穴位于珊瑚礁内部的一个空洞中，这个空洞是由龙龟杀死的一只巨大的海虫钻出来的。位于架子底层的原始入口通过一条杂草丛生的管道上升到主室。在这里，龙龟的巢穴在沿着后墙的一个凹陷的架子上，在那里，这个生物可以俯视散落在密室地板上的囤积物。虽然巢穴大部分被海水淹没，但在主室的顶部3英尺处却有一层可呼吸的空气。",
	"A secondary entrance grants access to a coral shelf 40 feet above the shelf floor and illuminates the lair for a few hours each day with a shaft of dim sunlight.": "一个次要的入口可以进入离架子地面40英尺高的珊瑚架，每天有几个小时的昏暗阳光照耀着这个巢穴。",
	"Sea serpents rank alongside dragon turtles as some of the most feared predators of the deep and inspire many sailors' worst nightmares. Their strong fins propel them through the water at great speed.": "海蛇与龙龟并列成为深海中最可怕的掠食者，激发了许多水手最可怕的噩梦。它们强有力的鳍推动着它们以极快的速度穿过水面。",
	"Young sea serpents are agile hunters. They use reefs and natural camouflage to hide before they strike, picking off members of a ship's crew one by one. Ancient sea serpents grow large enough to demolish whole ships, then feed at leisure on helpless sailors in the water. At any age, a sea serpent attacks with terrible bites, a lashing tail, a constricting grip, and a frigid breath weapon that can leave sailors' corpses floating frozen amid the wreckage of their ships.": "年轻的海蛇是敏捷的猎手。它们在出击前利用礁石和天然的伪装隐藏起来，将船上的船员一个个地挑走。古老的海蛇长得足够大，可以拆毁整艘船，然后悠闲地以水中无助的水手为食。在任何年龄段，海蛇都会以可怕的撕咬、甩动的尾巴、紧缩的手掌和冰冷的呼吸武器进行攻击，可以让水手的尸体漂浮在船只的残骸中被冻结。",
	"Sea serpents are as fiercely territorial as any other dragons, and they do not take kindly to ships passing over their domains without permission. Some can be appeased by offerings of treasure, but most demand that a ship's crew sacrifice one or more of their own.": "海蛇和其他龙一样具有强烈的领地意识，它们对未经允许而经过其领地的船只不以为然。有些海蛇可以通过献上财宝来安抚，但大多数海蛇要求船上的船员牺牲自己的一个或多个船员。",
	"Living amid the wreckage of sunken ships or in deep sea caves, sea serpents collect the cargo of the craft they sink, amassing great hoards of trade goods, sailors' trinkets, and pirates' booty.": "海蛇生活在沉船的残骸中或深海洞穴中，它们收集被击沉的船只的货物，积累了大量的贸易品、水手的饰品和海盗的战利品。",
	"A chromatic dragon's breath weapon is a manifestation of the energy that suffuses the dragon. With sufficient practice, dragons can learn to draw on magic from the Elemental Planes to shape their breath weapons into bipedal form, creating Elemental creatures called animated breaths. Chromatic dragons often use these creatures as guardians for their hoards or send them out to gather treasure from the territory around their lairs.": "色龙的呼吸武器是弥漫在龙身上的能量的一种表现形式。通过充分的练习，龙可以学会利用元素界的魔法，将它们的呼吸武器塑造成两足动物的形态，创造出被称为灵动呼吸的元素生物。色素龙经常使用这些生物作为它们的囤积物的守护者，或者派它们去巢穴周围的领土上收集宝藏。",
	"An animated breath is a bipedal creature formed from the same energy as the breath weapon of the dragon that created it. A red dragon's creation strongly resembles a fire elemental, while a black dragon's is similar to a water elemental, but viscous and foul-looking. A green dragon's animated poison breath looks like billowing clouds of green gas, while a white dragon's animated cold breath looks like a walking ice sculpture with frigid air whirling around it. A blue dragon's animated lightning breath is a constantly shifting form of crackling lightning, and it can suddenly vanish from one place to reappear in another, striking like a bolt from the blue.": "活化气息是一种双足生物，由创造它的龙的呼吸武器的相同能量形成。红龙的创造物非常类似于火元素，而黑龙的创造物则类似于水元素，但看起来很粘稠、很脏。绿龙的灵动毒气看起来像绿色气体的波浪云，而白龙的灵动冷气看起来像一个行走的冰雕，周围有寒冷的空气在旋转。蓝龙的闪电气息是一种不断变化的噼里啪啦的闪电形式，它可以突然从一个地方消失，然后在另一个地方重新出现，像一道来自蓝色的闪电。",
	"Known as the Platinum Dragon, Bahamut is the patron and progenitor of metallic dragons. Since fleeing the First World, he has made his home in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia and is often numbered among the gods of that plane. Adventurers and dragons alike pray to Bahamut to uphold honor and justice, or when they need courage to face a great threat. In the most dire situations, a powerful follower of Bahamut who makes a tremendous sacrifice—a vast hoard or even the follower's own life—might convince the god to send aid to the world in the form of a divine aspect. This aspect is a physical manifestation of the Platinum Dragon, carrying his memories and will—and a significant portion of his formidable strength.": "巴哈姆特被称为白金龙，是金属龙的守护者和祖先。自从逃离第一世界后，他就在天龙山的七重天安了家，并经常被列入该星球的神灵之列。冒险者和龙都向巴哈姆特祈祷，以维护荣誉和正义，或者当他们需要勇气来面对巨大的威胁时。在最危急的情况下，一个强大的巴哈姆特追随者如果做出巨大的牺牲--大量的囤积物甚至追随者自己的生命--可能会说服神以神圣的形式向这个世界提供援助。这个方面是白金龙的物理表现，携带着他的记忆和意志，以及他强大力量的重要部分。",
	"Bahamut's aspect displays the full glory of the Platinum Dragon, towering over even ancient dragons. Covered in platinum scales, his physical features combine various elements of the five kinds of metallic dragons—according to some scholars, combining them in different ways with each manifestation of the aspect. But Bahamut is also fond of traveling the Material Plane in disguise, so his aspect might appear as a wizened old sage, a young monk, or a songbird. In any form, Bahamut's aspect is often accompanied by seven ancient gold dragons who favor disguising themselves as canaries.": "巴哈姆特的一面展示了白金龙的全部荣耀，甚至比古代龙还高。他的身体覆盖着铂金的鳞片，他的身体特征结合了五种金属龙的各种元素--根据一些学者的说法，在每个方面的表现中都以不同的方式结合它们。但巴哈姆特也喜欢乔装打扮在物质世界旅行，所以他的一面可能会出现在一个年老的贤者，一个年轻的和尚，或者一只鸣禽。在任何形式下，巴哈姆特的一面经常由七条古老的金龙陪伴，它们喜欢把自己伪装成金丝雀。",
	"In combat, Bahamut's enemies experience the full force of his justice, while his allies enjoy the full benefit of his mercy. His breath can wreak monumental destruction and work miraculous healing, and few things in the mortal world can cause him lasting harm.": "在战斗中，巴哈姆特的敌人会感受到他正义的全部力量，而他的盟友则会享受到他仁慈的全部好处。他的气息可以造成巨大的破坏，也可以产生神奇的疗效，凡间很少有东西可以给他带来持久的伤害。",
	"The five-headed progenitor of chromatic dragons, Tiamat embodies the vices of evil dragons. Since the destruction of the First World, she has dwelled in the Nine Hells—some say by choice. But others claim that she is imprisoned there to punish her for the evils she perpetrated when the gods sought to colonize the First World with their followers.": "提亚马特是五头色龙的祖先，体现了恶龙的恶习。自第一世界毁灭以来，她一直居住在九层地狱--有人说是出于自愿。但也有人声称，她被囚禁在那里是为了惩罚她在诸神试图用他们的追随者殖民第一世界时犯下的恶行。",
	"Mortals who hunger for power and wealth often swear fealty to Tiamat in pursuit of those goals. Many of her followers have attempted to break her out of Avernus—and failed—but even while she remains in the Nine Hells, Tiamat can send her aspect to manifest in the Material Plane. A follower with enough power and anger, and with a hoard worthy of ancient dragons, can sacrifice it all to unleash the wrath of the dragon queen on a world.": "渴望权力和财富的凡人经常向提亚马特宣誓效忠以追求这些目标。她的许多追随者都曾试图将她从阿弗纳斯（Avernus）中解救出来，但都失败了，但即使她仍在九层地狱，提亚马特也能将她的一面显现在物质世界。一个拥有足够力量和愤怒的追随者，并且拥有堪比古龙的囤积物，可以牺牲这一切来释放龙后对一个世界的愤怒。",
	"The aspect of Tiamat has the body of a titanic dragon with five heads, each the shape and hue of a different chromatic dragon. Each head might speak separately and have different mannerisms, but they are all Tiamat. Once unleashed, the aspect of Tiamat rampages across the world, acquiring any treasure she can find and destroying any creature that dares to cross her path.": "提亚马特的方面有一个泰坦尼克龙的身体，有五个头，每个头的形状和色调都是不同的色度的龙。每个头都可能单独说话，有不同的举止，但它们都是提亚马特。一旦被释放，提亚马特就会在世界范围内横冲直撞，获取她能找到的任何财宝，并摧毁任何敢于与她相交的生物。",
	"The most ancient chromatic dragons, who have survived over twelve hundred years of mortal life and acquired vast hoards worth millions of gold pieces, can achieve a form of apotheosis, reaching a level of power approaching that of Tiamat's mighty aspect. The competitive avarice of dragonkind and the interference of adventurers prevent most dragons from attaining this level of power. But a chromatic dragon who can outwit all rivals and overcome all potential thieves can rise to become one of the mightiest of dragons.": "最古老的色龙，在凡人的生活中存活了一千两百多年，并获得了价值数百万金币的大量囤积物，可以达到一种神化的形式，达到接近提亚马特的强大方面的力量水平。龙族的竞争性贪婪和冒险者的干扰使大多数龙无法达到这种力量水平。但是，一个能够智取所有对手并战胜所有潜在盗贼的色龙可以上升为最强大的龙之一。",
	"Often a chromatic greatwyrm's ascension involves fusing the power of a single dragon's echoes across different worlds of the Material Plane. The black greatwyrm Chronepsis, for example, is said to have stalked multiple worlds and devoured many of his echoes before withdrawing to a planar lair in the Outlands. The red greatwyrm Ashardalon worked with a balor to ritually drain the power of his echoes, then infused their power into himself by implanting the balor where his heart had been.": "通常情况下，色阶大巫师的提升涉及到在物质世界的不同世界中融合一条龙的回声的力量。例如，据说黑色大龙Chronepsis曾在多个世界徘徊，吞噬了许多他的回声，然后撤回到外域的一个平面巢穴。红色大巫师阿沙达隆与一个巴洛尔合作，以仪式的方式耗尽了他的回声的力量，然后通过将巴洛尔植入他的心脏位置，将其力量注入自己体内。",
	"In both size and power, chromatic greatwyrms exceed even ancient dragons. The energy of their breath weapons courses over their bodies and glows under their scales, and elemental forces rage around them when they exert their wrath. They no longer need to eat or drink, as their vast hoards magically sustain them. And their power can raze a city to the ground, destroying buildings and defenders alike.": "在体型和力量方面，色魔甚至超过了古龙。他们的呼吸武器的能量流经他们的身体，在他们的鳞片下发光，当他们发怒时，元素的力量在他们周围肆虐。他们不再需要吃喝，因为他们巨大的囤积物可以神奇地维持他们。它们的力量可以将一座城市夷为平地，摧毁建筑物和保卫者。",
	"Some of the oldest and wisest metallic dragons undergo a miraculous metamorphosis to become greatwyrms. This transformation is often wrought by Bahamut, who takes pride in elevating his worthiest children to a status approaching his own greatness.": "一些最古老、最聪明的金属龙经历了奇迹般的蜕变，成为大巫师。这种转变通常是由巴哈姆特完成的，他以将他最有价值的孩子提升到接近自己的伟大地位为荣。",
	"A metallic greatwyrm's transformation often involves fusing the consciousness, the magic, and sometimes even the physical forms of multiple echoes of the same dragon across the worlds of the Material Plane. Several of the dragons identified as dragon gods—including Aasterinian (described in the \"Brass Dragons \"section of chapter 5), Lendys, and Tamara—are metallic greatwyrms who have combined the essences of multiple forms to achieve this godlike status.": "一个金属大巫师的转变往往涉及到融合意识、魔法，有时甚至是同一只龙在物质世界中的多个回声的物理形态。一些被认定为龙神的龙--包括阿斯特里尼安（在第五章的 \"黄铜龙 \"部分有所描述）、兰迪斯和塔玛拉--都是金属大巫师，他们融合了多种形态的精华以达到这种神的地位。",
	"Metallic greatwyrms are among the largest creatures in the multiverse, overshadowing most other dragons. Mighty elemental forces swirl around them in response to their wishes, and their breath weapons can sap the strength from armies—or lay waste to whole regions.": "金属大巫师是多元宇宙中最大的生物之一，让大多数其他龙都黯然失色。强大的元素力量在它们周围旋转，以回应它们的愿望，它们的呼吸武器可以抽走军队的力量--或者浪费整个地区。",
	"Lendys and Tamara are both silver greatwyrms, but they could not be more different from each other.": "兰迪斯和塔玛拉都是银色的大巫师，但他们彼此之间的差别再大不过了。",
	"Lendys is renowned as an impartial judge who is equally ready to serve as jury and executioner when dragons commit grave injustices against dragonkind. He is lawful neutral, and he is said to be incapable of mercy or forgiveness.": "兰迪斯以公正的法官而闻名，当龙对龙族犯下严重的不公正行为时，他同样准备充当陪审团和刽子手。他是合法的中立者，而且据说他不可能有怜悯或宽恕之心。",
	"Tamara, by contrast, embodies the ideal of mercy. She heals the sick, tends the injured, and delivers a peaceful departure to dragons nearing the end of their natural lives. She has a particular loathing for dracoliches and other draconic Undead.": "相比之下，塔玛拉体现了仁慈的理想。她医治病人，照顾受伤的人，并为即将结束自然生命的龙提供和平的离开。她特别厌恶龙族和其他龙族的不死生物。",

	"Dragonnels are distantly related to chromatic, gem, and metallic dragons and resemble them in basic form.

	"Kin to the common mimic described in the {@i Monster Manual}, hoard mimics are among the oldest and most cunning of their kind. A hoard mimic's massive, amorphous form and shape-shifting prowess allow it to take on the semblance of a vast trove of treasures, not just a single object. Like smaller mimics, hoard mimics exude adhesive goo to trap prey. They can also vent a fine, caustic mist from their pores that burns and blinds creatures caught in it.": "与{@i Monster Manual}中描述的普通拟态相类似，囤积物拟态是它们中最古老和最狡猾的一种。囤积物模仿者巨大的、无定形的外形和变形的能力使它能够呈现出一个巨大的宝藏库的样子，而不仅仅是一个单一的物体。像小型模仿者一样，囤积物模仿者会散发粘性粘液来诱捕猎物。它们还能从毛孔中喷出细小的、腐蚀性的雾气，烧伤和弄瞎陷入其中的生物。",

	"Hoard scarabs are beetle-like creatures that, through some feat of natural adaptation or alchemical ingenuity, blend in perfectly among piles of gold coins.

An ancient dragon turtle is a mythic creature akin to a greatwyrm, combining the power of multiple echoes from across the worlds of the Material Plane. Such a creature can be as large as an island—and indeed, legends suggest that many unwitting sailors wrecked at sea have mistaken slumbering dragon turtles for solid ground.": "龙龟是一种强大的生物，其固有的魔法与物质界的海洋密切相关。在{@i Monster Manual}中介绍的龙龟是一个典型的成年人，至少有一个世纪的历史，拥有宝贵的囤积物。你可以将本节中的状态块用于年长或年轻的龙龟。此外，第5章还包括可用于成年或古代龙龟的巢穴行动和区域效应。古代龙龟是一种类似于大巫师的神话生物，它结合了来自物质界各个世界的多个回声的力量。这种生物可以像岛屿一样大--事实上，传说中许多不知情的水手在海上失事时都把沉睡的龙龟误认为是坚实的地面。",
