	"Arauthator has attracted a number of ice toads to Oyaviggaton, where they help to maintain the iceberg and the dragon's many treasures and trophies. The ice toads are good at this job, thanks to their exceptionally intelligent leader, Marfulb.": "Arauthator吸引了许多冰蟾蜍来到奥亚维加顿，在那里它们帮助维护冰山和龙的许多宝物和战利品。冰蟾蜍们很擅长这项工作，这要归功于他们异常聪明的领袖--马福尔布。",
	"Feeding on seals, sea birds, and fish caught for them by the Ice Hunters, Oyaviggaton's ice toads are not automatically hostile to strangers. Once characters get inside Arauthator's lair, they might find that these creatures can be helpful to their quest. Ice toads normally speak only their own obscure language. Those in Oyaviggaton know a little Draconic and Uluik (the language of the Ice Hunters), but their accents are thick and their pronunciation atrocious. Marfulb is fluent in Draconic thanks to many hours spent conversing with Arauthator.": "奥亚维加顿的冰蟾蜍以海豹、海鸟和猎冰人为食，对陌生人不会自动产生敌意。一旦人物进入阿劳特的巢穴，他们可能会发现这些生物会对他们的探索有所帮助。冰蟾蜍通常只说自己的晦涩语言。那些在奥亚维加顿的人知道一点Draconic和Uluik（冰雪猎人的语言），但他们的口音很重，发音很难听。由于与Arauthator交谈了许多时间，Marfulb能说流利的Draconic语。",
	"When the characters encounter ice toads, their intelligence won't be apparent until they act or attempt to speak. Even then, characters might not recognize the ice toads' croaking as language. Ice toads move on all fours, but their webbed front feet are surprisingly dexterous. Some carry tools and useful items in pouches slung around their necks.": "当人物遇到冰蟾蜍时，他们的智力不会被发现，直到他们采取行动或试图说话。即使如此，角色们也未必能认出冰蟾的呱呱叫声是语言。冰蟾以四肢移动，但它们有蹼的前脚却出奇的灵巧。有些冰蟾将工具和有用的物品放在脖子上的袋子里。"
