	"Whether hailing from the stars or sprouting from hidden depths, the malicious vegetation known as bodytaker plants seek to become the dominant form of life wherever they appear. These invasive organisms subvert whole societies by consuming individuals and replacing them with duplicates called podlings. Bodytaker plants view themselves as perfect organisms and seek to dominate the lands where they grow. To their minds, a world would be healthier and more efficient were they in control. Anyone who disagrees either lacks perspective or is fit to serve only as fertilizer.": "不管是来自星星还是从隐蔽的深处发芽，被称为 \"造尸者 \"的恶意植被试图在它们出现的地方成为生命的主导形式。这些入侵的生物体通过吞噬个体并以被称为豆荚的复制体取代来颠覆整个社会。制体者植物将自己视为完美的生物体，并寻求主宰它们生长的土地。在他们看来，如果由他们来控制，世界会更健康、更有效率。任何持不同意见的人要么缺乏洞察力，要么只适合充当肥料。",
	"A bodytaker plant roots deep, spreading near-invisible filaments through the soil. Should any of these fibers survive the plant's destruction, the bodytaker plant regrows after a matter of months. Salting or poisoning the soil where it grew destroys these filaments and prevents the plant from reappearing.": "造身者植物的根系很深，在土壤中传播几乎看不见的细丝。如果这些纤维中的任何一个在植物的破坏中幸存下来，那么造尸者植物在几个月后就会重新生长。在其生长的土壤中撒盐或投毒会破坏这些细丝，并防止该植物重新出现。",

Most rise from the bodies of those who've suffered brutal ends, such as deliberate skinning or crushing. Deathless malice infuses what remains, their husks flopping and slithering in pursuit of vengeance or at the whims of sinister masters.

While the animate skins of specific creatures are the most common, foul spellcasters might create these horrors from the scraps of failed experiments, necromantic slurries, heaps of discarded hair, abattoirs, and charnel concoctions. These origins don't affect a boneless's statistics but lend it distinct forms.": "无骨者以各种形式出现。虽然特定生物的有生命的皮肤是最常见的，但邪恶的施法者可能会从失败的实验、死灵的泥浆、一堆废弃的头发、屠宰场和腐烂的混合物中创造出这些恐怖的东西。这些来源并不影响无骨者的统计数据，但会赋予其独特的形式。",

This destroys the zombie, but unleashes a new horror.": "不止一个死灵法师将一具被腐肉潜行者幼虫侵袭的尸体变成了动画。虽然这可能被证明是令人震惊和致命的，但一些堕落的施法者在僵尸体内培养腐肉潜行者。嵌入的腐肉潜行者在他们新鲜的动画运输工具中骑行，一旦发现附近的生物就会爆发出来。这将摧毁僵尸，但释放出一种新的恐怖。",

It then uses its needle to swap souls with the victim, stealing the victim's body while trapping the victim's soul in its own doll-like frame. The carrionette then imprisons its old body, keeping the animate doll hidden while it explores the world in its stolen guise—often that of the very person who wished the carrionette into being.": "每个腐尸都拥有一根银针，将其灵魂钉在身体上。通过冒充简单的玩具或隐藏自己的欲望，腐尸会接近毫无戒心的受害者。然后它用针与受害者交换灵魂，偷走受害者的身体，同时将受害者的灵魂困在自己的玩偶般的框架中。然后，腐尸囚禁了它的旧身体，把有生命的娃娃藏起来，而它则以被盗的身份探索世界--通常是希望腐尸出现的那个人的身份。",

While marionettes and porcelain dolls are the most common, all manner of deadly stuffed animals, crawling jack-in-the-boxes, bloodthirsty poppets, murderous jewelry box ballerinas, and so forth might be carrionettes. These malicious toys are skilled deceivers and, despite some having existed for generations, often affect unsettlingly childlike personalities. Among the most notorious of these terrors is the carrionette Maligno, Darklord of the domain of Odaire (detailed in chapter 3).": "驯兽师可能以任何类型的玩具或艺术品的形式出现。虽然牵线木偶和瓷娃娃是最常见的，但各种致命的毛绒动物、爬行的千斤顶、嗜血的爆米花、杀人的珠宝盒芭蕾舞者等等都可能是木偶。这些恶毒的玩具是熟练的欺骗者，尽管有些已经存在了几代人，但往往影响到令人不安的儿童性格。在这些可怕的东西中，最臭名昭著的是腐尸Maligno，Odaire领地的黑暗领主（详见第三章）。",
	"A death's head is a disembodied, flying head. The type of creature one of these grotesque undead originated from determines how it terrorizes it prey.

	"Wicked knights or commanders in life, dullahans adhere to twisted codes of chivalry or soldiership. These fallen champions consider a specific location their battlefield. This gives rise to stories of haunted battlegrounds, ruins, roads, river crossings and other strategic locations where a dullahan continues a terrifying campaign against the living. In death, dullahans are often rejoined by those who followed them in life, either in the form of lesser undead, like skeletons or wights, or terrifying mounts, like warhorse skeletons or nightmares.": "生活中的邪恶骑士或指挥官，杜拉拉们坚持扭曲的骑士精神或士兵精神的准则。这些堕落的冠军认为一个特定的地点是他们的战场。这就产生了关于闹鬼的战场、废墟、道路、河流渡口和其他战略地点的故事，在这些地方，杜拉拉人继续对活人展开可怕的行动。在死后，杜拉拉人往往会被那些生前追随他们的人重新加入，要么是以较小的亡灵形式，如骷髅或巫师，要么是可怕的坐骑，如战马骷髅或噩梦。",

Only when truly threatened, or when their foes have lost all hope, do emissaries reveal their actual, impossible forms.": "很少有人了解多元宇宙的全部饥饿敌意。星际使者是异域的手指，是将现实的天平推向恐怖的手指。在不祥的星象事件的预示下，这些贪婪的入侵者让世界为难以想象的主人或遥远的、更伟大的自身表现做好准备。特使们利用他们可塑性强的形式，在全球范围内努力破坏对秩序、信任和现实的看法，让世界为打破理智的启示和层层叠叠的世界末日做好准备。只有在真正受到威胁时，或者当他们的敌人失去所有的希望时，使者才会显露出他们真正的、不可能的形式。",
	"Star spawn emissaries can assume two forms: a lesser form suited to infiltration and a greater, physically overwhelming form. To destroy an emissary, characters must reduce each of its forms to 0 hit points one after another. Typically, a star spawn emissary is initially encountered in its lesser form.

Only if the emissary is defeated in its greater form does the star spawn die.": "星际使者可以有两种形态：一种是适合潜入的较小形态，另一种是更大的、身体上的压倒性形态。要消灭一个使者，角色必须把它的每一种形态都逐一降低到0点。通常情况下，星际使者一开始是以较小的形态出现的。当这种形态被摧毁时，使者的身体会崩溃成一团血浆。然后它就会立即以大形态返回。只有当使者以大形态被击败时，星产才会死亡。",

They used that power to read thoughts, reshape memories, and dominate the recalcitrant. The inquisitors in the Order of Ansel subjected themselves to harsh asceticism in an effort to use psionic energy to empower their own bodies.

Rather than be angry at Isolde, Zybilna was impressed by her. She enlisted a powerful fiend known only as \"the Caller\" to corrupt and slay all of Isolde's companions, leaving Isolde alone, bitter, and vulnerable. The insidious archfey then befriended Isolde and offered to help her forget her terrible losses. Isolde became the master of a traveling fey carnival that served as a gateway to Zybilna's domain.

Their bravery would have been for naught if Osybus's disciples hadn't betrayed him.

Such unspeakable horrors might continue to haunt the misty netherworld between the Domains of Dread, or they might slink forth into other realms to slake unnameable hungers.": "不为人知的、半成型的邪恶潜伏在迷雾之中，是黑暗势力尚未实现的想象和废墟领域的残余。虽然这种噩梦通常表现为印象、低语或雾中的虚无幻象，但迷雾中的神秘漩涡有时会聚集这种邪恶，迫使它们变成独特的、不受理性或现实规律约束的畸形体。这种难以言喻的恐怖可能会继续在恐惧之域之间的缥缈阴间出没，或者它们可能会溜到其他领域去满足不可名状的饥渴。",
	"An unspeakable horror has one of four body compositions, determined by rolling on the Body Composition table. You can roll on the Limbs to customize it further, while results from the Hex Blast table replace that action in the stat block. If the results of multiple tables conflict, chose your preferred result.": "不可言喻的恐怖人物有四种身体构成之一，由身体构成表上的滚动决定。你可以在四肢上滚动来进一步定制它，而六芒星爆炸表的结果取代了状态块中的那个动作。如果多个表格的结果有冲突，请选择你喜欢的结果。",
	"The results of these tables are meant to be broad, so feel free to describe the details of an unspeakable horror's form and the interplay between its parts however you desire. The more discordant and unexpected a horror's parts, the more unsettling it might be.": "这些表格的结果是宽泛的，所以请随意描述不可言说的恐怖的形式和其各部分之间的相互作用的细节。恐怖的各个部分越不和谐，越出人意料，它就越令人不安。",
	"Some who wander into the Land of the Mists seek to stay hidden in the haze. They might even wish to dwell amid the endless fog, finding it preferable to horrors elsewhere. But the Mists drifting between the Domains of Dread are far from safe—or empty.": "一些徘徊在迷雾之地的人寻求隐藏在雾气中。他们甚至可能希望居住在无尽的雾中，认为这比其他地方的恐怖更可取。但漂浮在恐惧之域之间的迷雾远非安全--或空虚。",
	"Mist horrors are bodiless spirits of dread, entities given form by the fears of those they encounter. Mist horrors use the unspeakable horror stat block with the Malleable Mass body option, which makes them appear to be composed of living mist. Further details of a mist horror's appearance are drawn from the fears of those within 100 feet of it. This might cause a mist horror to take on a form that combines multiple fears when it encounters a group, like a wolf with snakes for eyes or a drowned giant that resembles an estranged parent. Mist horrors can't persist for long outside the Mists: after {@dice 1d4} rounds outside the Mists, they lose cohesion and collapse back into harmless vapor.": "雾状恐怖是无体的恐惧之灵，是由它们遇到的人的恐惧所赋予的实体。迷雾恐怖使用不可言说的恐怖状态块和可塑性的身体选项，这使得它们看起来是由活的迷雾组成的。雾状恐怖的外观的更多细节来自于它周围100英尺内的人的恐惧。这可能会导致迷雾恐怖在遇到一群人的时候，呈现出一种结合了多种恐惧的形态，比如一只用蛇做眼睛的狼，或者一个像被疏远的父母一样的溺水巨人。迷雾恐怖在迷雾之外不能持续很久：在迷雾之外的{@dice 1d4}回合之后，它们会失去凝聚力，并崩溃成无害的蒸汽。",
	"The horror's body is armored in petrified wood, alien crystal, rusted mechanisms, sculpted stone, or an exoskeleton.": "恐怖的身体以石化的木头、外星水晶、生锈的机制、雕刻的石头或外骨骼为铠甲。",
	"The horror's body boasts spider like legs, many-jointed appendages, or thrashing tentacles.": "恐怖的身体拥有蜘蛛一样的腿，多关节的附属物，或惊恐的触手。",
	"The horror's body is composed of a clot of boneless flesh, shadowy tendrils, or mist.": "恐怖的身体是由无骨的肉块、阴暗的卷须或雾气组成。",
	"The horror's body boasts exposed entrails, bloated parasites, or a gelatinous shroud, perhaps because it is inside out.": "恐怖的身体拥有暴露的内脏，臃肿的寄生虫，或凝胶状的裹尸布，也许是因为它是内向的。",
	"The horror expels a wave of mind-altering magic. Each creature within 30 feet of the horror must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking 33 ({@dice 6d10}) psychic damage and being incapacitated until the end of the creature's next turn on a failed save, or taking half as much damage on a successful one.": "恐怖会释放出一股改变心智的魔法。在恐怖的30英尺范围内的每个生物都必须做一个DC 15的智慧救赎，如果救赎失败，将受到33({@dice 6d10})的精神伤害并丧失能力，直到该生物的下一回合结束；如果救赎成功，将受到一半的伤害。",
	"The horror expels petrifying gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 14 ({@dice 4d6}) necrotic damage and be restrained as it begins to turn to stone. A restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is petrified until freed by the {@spell greater restoration} spell or other magic.": "恐怖会在30英尺的范围内释放出石化的气体。该区域内的每个生物都必须在DC15宪法规定的投掷中成功，否则会受到14({@dice 4d6})的坏死伤害，并在开始变成石头时被限制。被禁锢的生物必须在下一回合结束时重复该蓄力动作。成功时，该效果在目标身上结束。如果失败，目标会被石化，直到被{@spell greater restoration}的咒语或其他魔法解救。",
	"The horror expels a wave of perception-distorting energy. Each creature within 30 feet of the horror must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 ({@dice 5d8}) psychic damage and is deafened until the end of its next turn. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also blinded until the end of its next turn.": "恐怖会释放出一波扭曲感知的能量。在恐怖的30英尺范围内的每个生物都必须做一个DC 15的智慧救赎动作。如果救赎失败，目标会受到22({@dice 5d8})的精神伤害并被震聋，直到下一回合结束。如果蓄力失败5次或以上，目标也会失明，直到下一回合结束。",
	"The horror's limb ends in a blade made of bone, which deals slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage. In addition, it scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 and rolls the damage dice of a crit three times, instead of twice.": "恐怖的肢体末端是由骨头制成的刀刃，可以造成砍击伤害而不是重击伤害。此外，它在掷出19或20个骰子时可获得关键一击，并将关键一击的伤害骰子掷出三次，而不是两次。",
	"The horror's limb attack deals an extra 9 ({@dice 2d8}) acid damage.": "恐怖的肢体攻击会造成额外的9({@dice 2d8})酸性伤害。",
	"The horror's limb is a grasping tentacle. When the horror hits a creature with this limb, the creature is also grappled (escape DC 16). The limb can have only one creature grappled at a time.": "恐怖的肢体是一个抓取的触手。当恐怖用这个肢体击中一个生物时，这个生物也会被抓紧（逃脱DC16）。该肢体在同一时间只能抓捕到一个生物。",
	"The horror's limb deals piercing damage instead of bludgeoning damage. In addition, when the horror hits a creature with this limb, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 7 ({@dice 2d6}) poison damage and be poisoned until the end of its next turn.": "恐怖的肢体会造成穿刺伤害而不是重击伤害。此外，当恐怖组织用此肢体击中一个生物时，该生物必须在DC 15宪法救赎中成功，否则会受到7({@dice 2d6})的毒害，并被毒死，直到下一回合结束。",
	"When the mind flayers of Bluetspur (see chapter 3) could find no cure for their overlord's affliction, their degenerating elder brain turned to radical methods to stave off dementia and death. The results were vampiric mind flayers, feral atrocities spawned from mind flayer tadpoles infected with vampirism. These specialized but flawed terrors serve a single purpose: to drain the cerebral fluids from sapient minds. After doing so, they return to the Elder Brain of Bluetspur, which liquefies them into its pool and releases their stolen essences amid a hormone brine. This grotesque balm stalls the elder brain's degeneration but is far from a cure.": "当Bluetspur（见第3章）的读心者找不到治疗他们的霸主之苦的方法时，他们退化的长者大脑转向了激进的方法来避免痴呆和死亡。其结果是吸血性的心灵传播者，由感染了吸血症的心灵传播者蝌蚪所产生的野性暴行。这些专门的但有缺陷的怪物只有一个目的：从有智慧的人的头脑中抽出脑液。这样做之后，它们会回到蓝刺的长老脑中，长老脑会将它们液化到它的池子里，并在荷尔蒙盐水中释放它们偷来的精华。这种怪异的药膏可以延缓长老脑的退化，但远远不能治愈。",
	"Vampiric mind flayers are physically and mentally unstable beings. Ghoulish creatures, they let nothing stand between them and their existential imperatives. Although they possess the telepathic abilities of mind flayers, their brains aren't equipped to employ them. Instead, they bombard nearby creatures with a mental static of visceral visions. While these ravenous creatures are horrifying to behold, they unsettle none more than other mind flayers, which consider them abominations.": "吸血鬼式的思想传播者是身体和精神上不稳定的人。他们是可怕的生物，他们不让任何东西挡在他们和他们的生存需要之间。虽然他们拥有心灵感应的能力，但他们的大脑并不具备运用这些能力的条件。相反，他们用精神上的静态视觉轰击附近的生物。虽然这些贪婪的生物令人毛骨悚然，但它们却没有比其他的心灵传播者更让人不安，它们认为它们是可憎的。",
	"Wereravens are secretive and extraordinarily cautious lycanthropes that trust one another but are wary of just about everyone else. Although skilled at blending into society, they keep mostly to themselves, respect local laws, and strive to do good whenever possible.": "狼人是秘密的、特别谨慎的狼人，他们互相信任，但对其他所有人都很警惕。虽然他们善于融入社会，但他们大多保持自我，尊重当地法律，并尽可能地努力做好事。",
	"In their human and hybrid forms, wereravens favor light weapons. They are reluctant to make bite attacks in raven form for fear of spreading their curse to those who don't deserve it or who would abuse it.": "在人类和混血儿的形态下，狼人喜欢轻型武器。它们不愿意在乌鸦形态下进行咬人攻击，因为害怕将它们的诅咒传播给那些不值得的人或滥用它的人。",
	"Wereravens refer to their tightly knit groups as kindnesses. A kindness of wereravens usually numbers between seven and twelve individuals. Not surprisingly, wereravens get along well with ravens and often hide in plain sight among them.": "狼人把他们紧密相连的群体称为 \"仁慈\"。狼群的数量通常在7至12只之间。毫不奇怪，乌鸦与乌鸦相处得很好，并经常躲在乌鸦中间显而易见。",
	"Wereravens like to collect shiny trinkets and precious baubles. They are fond of sharing their wealth with those in need and, in their humanoid forms, modestly give money to charity. They take steps to keep magic items out of evil hands by stashing them in secret hiding places.": "狼人喜欢收集闪亮的小饰品和珍贵的小玩意。他们喜欢与有需要的人分享他们的财富，在他们的人形形态下，他们会适度地把钱捐给慈善机构。他们采取措施，把魔法物品藏在秘密的地方，不让它们落入坏人手中。",
	"The Monster Manual has rules for characters afflicted with lycanthropy. The following text applies to wereraven characters specifically.": "怪物手册》中有关于受狼人症折磨的角色的规则。下面的文字特别适用于狼人角色。",
	"A character cursed with wereraven lycanthropy gains a Dexterity of 15 if his or her score isn't already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the wereraven's bite are based on whichever is higher of the character's Strength and Dexterity. The bite of a wereraven in raven form deals 1 piercing damage (no ability modifier applies to this damage) and carries the curse of lycanthropy; see the \"Player Characters as Lycanthropes\" sidebar in the lycanthropes entry in the Monster Manual for details.": "一个被狼牙棒诅咒的角色会获得15的灵巧，如果他或她的分数还不高的话。狼鸦咬人的攻击和伤害卷是基于角色的力量和灵巧中较高的一个。狼人的咬伤会造成1次穿刺伤害（该伤害不适用能力修改器），并带有狼人的诅咒；详情请参见《怪物手册》中狼人条目中的 \"玩家角色为狼人 \"侧边栏。",
	"Among the undead, a lone zombie ranks far from the most menacing. The horror of the shambling dead lies not in their individual menace, though, but their numbers, their persistence, and their disregard for their own well-being. A throng of zombies will douse a forest fire with their own ashes or march into a dragon's maw until the monster chokes. In the course of their relentless marches, zombies might suffer all manner of trauma, potentially reducing them to masses of crawling limbs (see swarm of zombie limbs), infecting them with terrible diseases (see zombie plague spreader), or crushing an entire horde into a single, rotting titan.": "在亡灵中，孤独的僵尸远远不是最可怕的。不过，摇摇晃晃的死人的恐怖不在于他们个人的威胁，而在于他们的数量、他们的持久性和他们对自身福祉的漠视。一群僵尸会用自己的灰烬浇灭森林大火，或进入龙的嘴里，直到怪物窒息。在他们无情的行进过程中，僵尸可能会遭受各种形式的创伤，有可能使他们变成一大群爬行的肢体（见僵尸肢体群），使他们感染可怕的疾病（见僵尸瘟疫传播者），或者将整个部落压成一个单一的、腐烂的泰坦。",
