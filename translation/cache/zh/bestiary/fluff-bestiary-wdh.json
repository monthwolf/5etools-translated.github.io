	"The vainglorious lady of House Cassalanter is schooled in the arcane arts. Like her husband Victoro, she worships Asmodeus. When they were young, Ammalia and Victoro signed a contract with the archdevil, trading the souls of their children for power, good health, and long life.

	"The Rosznar family was convicted of slave trading-highly illegal in Waterdeep-and banished over a hundred years ago, but has since returned. The Rosznars' inability to regain the respect they feel they deserve rankles them. The slave trade has continued in Amn and elsewhere, and it's not like other noble houses don't have skeletons in their closets. But just because of a little family squabble that went public, the Rosznar name has been said with a sneer for a century. As part of the family's constant effort to prove this conception wrong and win others' respect, Esvele has been brought up to be the most proper noble possible, partaking in lessons of etiquette, dance, and poise as befits someone of her station.": "罗斯纳家族曾因贩卖奴隶而被定罪--这在沃特迪普是极不合法的，一百多年前被放逐，但后来又回来了。罗斯纳家族无法重新获得他们认为自己应得的尊重，这让他们感到愤怒。奴隶贸易在安恩和其他地方一直在继续，而且其他贵族家族也不是没有人在他们的衣橱里藏着骷髅。但就因为一场公开的家族小争吵，罗斯纳这个名字在一个世纪以来一直被人嗤之以鼻。作为家族不断努力证明这种观念是错误的，并赢得别人的尊重的一部分，埃斯维尔一直被培养成最合适的贵族，参加礼仪、舞蹈以及与她的地位相称的姿态课程。",
	"In her younger days, Esvele openly rebelled, but that behavior led to locked doors at night and house guards watching her every move during the day. So she taught herself how to pick locks, pluck keys from belts and pouches, clamber up walls, and sneak past guards-playing the perfect daughter by day while cutting loose at night. To hide her identity from those she met, she wore a hood and mask, exchanging her fine clothes for the kind of practical clothing her parents would never let her wear.": "在她年轻的时候，Esvele公开反叛，但这种行为导致她在晚上被锁住，白天有守卫监视她的一举一动。因此，她自学了如何开锁，从腰带和袋子里拔出钥匙，爬上墙，偷偷摸摸地越过守卫--白天扮演完美的女儿，晚上则放纵自己。为了向她遇到的人隐藏自己的身份，她戴着头罩和面具，把她的漂亮衣服换成她父母不让她穿的那种实用衣服。",
	"One of the things Esvele has learned is to embrace the legend of the Black Viper. When she throws back her cloak to reveal the costume she has put together, most folk toss their purses and flee. If that doesn't work, she usually needs only to draw her dagger. Of course, some of the nobles she targets are made of sterner stuff, so Esvele has learned how to fight as well. She knows she's playing a dangerous game, but is satisfied that at least one member of the Rosznar family is earning the respect of Waterdeep's nobility.": "埃斯韦尔学到的东西之一是接受黑毒蛇的传说。当她把斗篷往后一扔，露出她拼凑起来的服装时，大多数人都会扔掉钱包，逃之夭夭。如果这不起作用，她通常只需要拔出她的匕首。当然，她所针对的一些贵族是由更坚固的材料制成的，所以埃斯维尔也学会了如何战斗。她知道自己在玩一个危险的游戏，但她很满意，因为至少有一个罗斯纳家族的成员正在赢得水底世界贵族的尊重。",

Still, if he gets involved in a brawl, he prefers fighting with fists or a well-flung tankard.": "他把他的魔法大剑Grimvault放在吧台下，触手可及，如果他愿意，可以用它把桌子劈成两半。他还可以拿出一把双弩（一种射程较小的重型弩，可向同一目标发射两支弩箭）。不过，如果他被卷入一场争斗，他更喜欢用拳头或掷出的酒杯战斗。",
	"Durnan doesn't often venture far from the Yawning Portal, using his employees to run errands for him as needed. If he's feeling charitable, he might gently discourage likable \"nobodies\" from venturing into Undermountain, if he thinks they wouldn't survive. He can also direct adventurers toward tavern regulars who might be able to help them or offer useful information.": "杜南并不经常远离哈欠门，而是根据需要利用他的雇员为他跑腿。如果他觉得自己很有爱心，他可能会温和地劝阻那些可爱的 \"无名小卒 \"不要冒险进入幽冥山，如果他认为他们无法生存。他也可以把冒险者引向酒馆的常客，他们可能会帮助他们或提供有用的信息。",

As time allows, she likes to venture outside the Palace of Waterdeep in disguise, just to clear her head or check up on old friends (and enemies).": "几年前，达古特-纽伦堡（Dagult Neverember）被赶出了水底世界的公开领主之位。在假面领主的要求下，拉拉尔不情愿地填补了这个空缺，并从那时起一直担任沃特德普的公开领主。起初，她被贵族和公会会长们的要求压得喘不过气来，但她已经很好地适应了她的新角色。她很少使用自己的魔法，而是依靠值得信赖的顾问和副手。在时间允许的情况下，她喜欢乔装打扮到水底宫殿以外的地方去冒险，只是为了让自己的头脑清醒，或者去看看老朋友（和敌人）。",
	"Laeral's relationship with Vajra Safahr, the current Blackstaff, has its challenges. For one thing, Laeral is much older, much wiser, and much more powerful than Vajra, whom she views as an insecure child. In addition, Vajra wields the Blackstaff, which has Khelben Arunsun's soul and the souls of all the other Blackstaffs bound inside it. Laeral covets the staff, because it contains all that's left of her husband. Not surprisingly, the two mages avoid each other as much as possible.": "拉伊尔与现任黑杖王金刚萨法尔的关系有其挑战。首先，拉伊尔比瓦吉拉年长得多，聪明得多，也强大得多，她认为瓦吉拉是个没有安全感的孩子。此外，金刚挥舞着黑杖，里面捆绑着凯尔本-阿伦森的灵魂和所有其他黑杖的灵魂。拉拉尔觊觎这根法杖，因为它包含了她丈夫的全部遗物。毫不奇怪，这两位法师尽可能地避开对方。",
	"In times of great need, Laeral can command Vajra to unleash Force Grey. Until that order is given, Force Grey isn't allowed to conduct operations in Waterdeep, though Laeral's spies tell her that Vajra has secretly activated members of the elite order and sent them on a number of unauthorized missions. Laeral is reluctant to confront Vajra on the matter, and rationalizes her inaction by framing it as a test of Vajra's competence.": "在非常需要的时候，拉拉尔可以命令金刚释放灰色力量。在这个命令下达之前，灰原力不允许在沃特迪普开展行动，尽管拉拉尔的间谍告诉她，金刚已经秘密激活了精英团的成员，并派他们执行了一些未经授权的任务。拉拉尔不愿意在这个问题上与金刚对峙，并将其视为对金刚能力的测试，从而使她的不作为合理化。",
	"Laiba Rosse, better known as \"Nana,\" is the caretaker and private tutor for Terenzio and Elzerina, and she does her best to keep track of their every move. Even so, the two often sneak away from her watchful eye. Nana dresses in flowing red robes.

	"The original Manshoon was one of the founders of the Zhentarim. Evil to the core, he made enemies all across Faerûn, including other powerful spellcasters such as Khelben Arunsun and Elminster. Fearing that he might be destroyed by his foes, Manshoon magically crafted several clones-but a mishap caused all of them to be awakened at once, whereupon they tried to destroy one another in a series of conflicts that came to be known as the Manshoon Wars.": "最初的Manshoon是Zhentarim的创始人之一。他邪恶至极，在整个Faerûn树敌无数，包括其他强大的施法者，如Khelben Arunsun和Elminster。由于担心自己会被敌人摧毁，曼松用魔法制作了几个克隆体--但一次意外导致所有克隆体同时被唤醒，于是他们试图在一系列冲突中互相摧毁，这被称为曼松战争。",
	"Now the original Manshoon is dead, and it's widely believed that all his clones were destroyed as well. In fact, at least three are still alive. The one presently in Waterdeep escaped death by hiding out in Undermountain, where he eventually ran afoul of Halaster Blackcloak. After a brief spell duel, Halaster captured Manshoon and amputated his left arm at the elbow for reasons unknown. Manshoon escaped imprisonment and fled Undermountain, taking refuge in the city above. Attempts to magically regenerate his severed limb failed, forcing him to craft an artificial arm and hand for himself.": "现在，最初的曼斯勋已经死了，人们普遍认为他的所有克隆体也被摧毁了。事实上，至少有三个还活着。目前在沃特德普的那个人通过躲藏在地下山逃脱了死亡，在那里他最终遇到了黑斗篷哈拉斯特。在一场简短的法术决斗之后，哈拉斯特抓住了曼斯勋，并从肘部截断了他的左臂，原因不明。曼斯勋逃脱了监禁，逃离了地下山，在上面的城市避难。试图用魔法使他的断肢再生的努力失败了，迫使他为自己制作了一个人造手臂和手。",
	"Manshoon took control of Kolat Towers, a crumbling residence in the Southern Ward that was abandoned years ago by the two wizards who built it. The edifice is surrounded by a magical barrier that has the properties of a wall of force. Manshoon rarely leaves the towers and uses a teleportation circle when he must do so, and thus is never seen entering or leaving.": "曼斯勋控制了科拉塔，这是位于南区的一座摇摇欲坠的住宅，多年前被建造它的两位巫师抛弃。这座大厦被一道神奇的屏障所包围，具有力墙的特性。曼松很少离开塔楼，当他必须这样做的时候，就会使用一个传送圈，因此从来没有人看到他进入或离开。",
	"Manshoon aims to rule Waterdeep and replace the City Watch with Black Network mercenaries that are loyal to him alone. By bribing and blackmailing the Masked Lords, he hopes to oust Laeral Silverhand as Open Lord and take her place, kill the Blackstaff, reduce the Masked Lords to mere vassals, and declare himself the Wizard-King of Waterdeep. Once the city is firmly in his clutches, Manshoon will then turn his attention toward Undermountain, destroy Halaster once and for all, and claim the dungeon's riches.": "曼斯勋的目标是统治沃特迪普，用只效忠于他的黑网雇佣兵取代城市守卫。通过贿赂和勒索假面领主，他希望推翻拉拉尔-银手作为开放领主的地位，并取而代之，杀死黑杖，将假面领主降为单纯的附庸，并宣布自己为水底世界的巫师国王。一旦城市被他牢牢掌控，曼斯勋就会把注意力转向山下，彻底摧毁哈拉斯特，并索取地牢的财富。",
	"Manshoon uses the {@spell simulacrum} spell to create a magical duplicate of himself as needed. He has customized the spell to increase his simulacrum's hit points at the expense of its spellcasting ability.": "Manshoon根据需要使用{@spell simulacrum}的咒语来创造一个自己的魔法复制品。他对该法术进行了定制，以增加他的模拟体的命中率，但却牺牲了其施法能力。",
	"Manshoon can have only one simulacrum at any given time, and he uses it as a subordinate to command his Zhentarim minions in the field. If his simulacrum is destroyed, Manshoon creates another. Each simulacrum has the statistics of Manshoon, with these changes:": "曼斯勋在任何时候都只能有一个模拟像，他用模拟像作为下属，在战场上指挥他的真塔里姆的部下。如果他的仿真器被毁，曼苏恩会创造另一个。每个模拟人都有曼斯勋的统计数据，但有以下变化。",
	"The simulacrum has no special equipment. Consequently, it has AC 12 and lacks the Magic Resistance trait and the Staff of Power action option.": "仿真人没有特殊装备。因此，它有12级攻击力，缺乏魔抗特性和力量之杖的行动选项。",
	"It loses all spell slots of 6th level and higher.": "它失去了所有6级以上的法术槽。",
	"It has a challenge rating of 8 (3,900 XP).": "它的挑战等级为8（3,900 XP）。",

	"Meloon is a handsome, formidable warrior in his prime, who serves the goddess Tymora and loves a good fight. His friends-among them Renaer Neverember and Vajra Safahr-describe him as honest, optimistic, and extraordinarily lucky. Until recently, he was a member of Force Grey and reported directly to the Blackstaff. In recent months, Meloon has spent much of his time at the Yawning Portal.": "梅隆是一个英俊、威武的壮年战士，他侍奉泰莫拉女神，喜欢打仗。他的朋友们--其中包括雷纳-纽文伯和金刚萨法尔--将他描述为诚实、乐观和特别幸运。直到最近，他还是灰色部队的成员，直接向黑杖报告。最近几个月，梅隆的大部分时间都在 \"打哈欠 \"门户度过。",
	"Three months ago, out of boredom, Meloon accompanied a fledgling band of adventurers on an expedition to Undermountain. There, his luck ran out. While resting in the dungeon, the adventuring party was attacked by monsters unleashed by Xanathar-including a number of intellect devourers. One of the creatures succeeded in magically devouring and replacing Meloon's brain, turning the champion of Tymora into a puppet. After finishing off his unsuspecting companions, Meloon returned to Waterdeep as a Xanathar Guild spy.": "三个月前，出于无聊，梅隆陪同一队刚起步的冒险家到地下山探险。在那里，他的运气用完了。在地牢里休息时，冒险团遭到了夏纳塔尔释放的怪物的袭击--包括一些智力吞噬者。其中一个怪物成功地用魔法吞噬并替换了梅隆的大脑，将这位泰莫拉的冠军变成了一个木偶。在解决了他那些毫无戒心的同伴之后，梅隆以夏纳塔尔公会间谍的身份回到了水底世界。",
	"The intellect devourer that inhabits Meloon's skull was bred by Nihiloor, a mind flayer in Xanathar's employ. It knows everything Meloon knew, and Meloon behaves much as he did before his descent into Undermountain. He hangs out at the Yawning Portal, tries to bond with adventurers, and offers a helping hand whenever doing so feels appropriate. The intellect devourer's primary goals are to steer adventurers away from Undermountain and get them to undertake quests that further the aims of Xanathar. Such quests usually involve the eradication of Xanathar's enemies, and Meloon is all too eager to fight alongside those who fall for his ruse.": "栖息在梅隆头骨中的智力吞噬者是由尼希洛尔（Nihiloor）培育出来的，他是夏纳塔尔手下的一个思想骗子。它知道梅隆所知道的一切，而梅隆的行为和他进入地下山之前的行为差不多。他在 \"哈欠门 \"闲逛，试图与冒险者建立联系，并在觉得合适的时候伸出援手。智力吞噬者的主要目标是引导冒险者离开幽冥山，并让他们去完成能促进赞那瑟的目标的任务。这些任务通常涉及铲除夏纳塔尔的敌人，而梅隆非常渴望与那些上当受骗的人一起战斗。",

Today, an older and wiser Mirt serves as one of the Masked Lords, a Harper, and a close advisor to Laeral Silverhand.

Mirt has survived the passing of centuries by means of magic, and of all the Masked Lords, he is the least concerned with concealing his identity.": "曾经被称为无情的米尔特和老狼的米尔特，作为一个冒险家和花花公子发了大财，并获得了声誉。如今，年长而睿智的米尔特成为假面领主之一，是哈珀的一员，也是拉拉尔-银手的亲密顾问。岁月并没有磨灭他，虽然他的肉体已经变得柔软，但他仍然保持着令人难以置信的坚强、活力和清晰的头脑。穆特通过魔法在几个世纪的岁月中幸存下来，在所有的假面领主中，他是最不关心隐藏自己身份的。",
	"Despite his prodigious girth, Mirt can move with good speed when he must, and he hasn't let his adventuring skills wither. His wife, Asper, passed away several years ago, and his rambling mansion has seen better days. Mirt spends his days embroiled in politics and whiles away his nights in drink and debauchery.": "尽管他的腰围很大，但米尔特在必要时能以良好的速度移动，而且他没有让他的冒险技能枯萎。他的妻子Asper几年前就去世了，他那栋破旧的豪宅也已不复存在。泥特白天卷入政治，晚上则在酒精和放荡中消磨时光。",

	"Xanathar's advisor is a nervous and conniving male drow named Nar'l Xibrindas. Nar'l's house was wiped out long ago, but he and his elder brother Soluun survived and joined Bregan D'aerthe. A year ago, Nar'l was given the difficult task of infiltrating the Xanathar Guild and getting as close to the beholder as possible. Not only did he succeed, but in the course of gaining Xanathar's trust, he managed to convince the beholder to eliminate its other advisors. The beholder's paranoia will eventually cause Xanathar to question the drow's loyalty, though, and Nar'l has become increasingly worried about his future. If forced to decide between himself and Bregan D'aerthe, he'll choose the former and betray his drow allies to save his own skin.": "Xanathar的顾问是一个紧张而狡猾的男性乌鸦，名叫Nar'l Xibrindas。Nar'l的家族很久以前就被消灭了，但他和他的哥哥Soluun幸存下来并加入了Bregan D'aerthe。一年前，Nar'l被赋予了一项艰巨的任务，那就是潜入Xanathar公会，尽可能地接近beholder。他不仅成功了，而且在获得Xanathar信任的过程中，他成功地说服了beholder消除其其他顾问。不过，看守者的偏执最终会导致Xanathar质疑乌鸦的忠诚度，而Nar'l对自己的未来也越来越担心。如果被迫在自己和布雷根-达埃特之间做出决定，他将选择前者，并背叛他的乌鸦盟友以保全自己的性命。",

	"Less than a year ago, the Gralhunds were approached by agents of the Zhentarim loyal to Manshoon, and the nobles formed an alliance with them. House Gralhund gives the Zhents coin and allows them to use the family's noble villa as a refuge.

	"Orond doesn't fully grasp how entwined the Black Network and his family have become-it is now next to impossible to separate one from the other. It's no secret in Waterdeep that the Black Network has firmly rooted itself in House Gralhund. But what's not generally known is that the Zhents in House Gralhund are agents of Manshoon. Neither Orond nor any other member of his family knows about the wizard's clone. As far as Orond and his wife are concerned, the local leaders of the Black Network (with Urstul Floxin chief among them) reside with them in the family villa.": "奥隆德并没有完全理解黑网和他的家族是如何纠缠在一起的--现在几乎不可能将二者分开。在沃特迪普，黑网已经牢牢扎根于格拉洪德家族，这已经不是什么秘密。但不为人知的是，格拉洪德家族中的振特是曼松的代理人。奥隆德和他的任何其他家庭成员都不知道巫师的克隆人。就奥隆德和他的妻子而言，黑网的当地领导人（其中以乌尔斯图尔-弗洛辛为首）与他们一起住在家族别墅里。",

When not in his wife's company, he is prone to excessive boasting and temper tantrums. When he must speak to strangers, he keeps his half-orc bodyguard Hrabbaz close by, for fear that others might attack and rob him at any moment.
