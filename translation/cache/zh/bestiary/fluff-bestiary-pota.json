	"Aerisi Kalinoth is the air prophet of the Elder Elemental Eye and leader of the Cult of the Howling Hatred.

	"Aerisi was a sheltered moon elf princess named Dara Algwynenn Kalinoth who grew up in a remote Faerie realm. Her parents had wished to protect her from the harsh realities of the world, but they only succeeded in spoiling her.

Soon after, her dreams led her to the ancient dwarven ruins where the spear Windvane awaited her.": "爱丽斯是一位受庇护的月精灵公主，名叫达拉-阿尔格温恩-卡里诺斯，在一个偏远的精灵王国长大。她的父母希望保护她远离这个世界的严酷现实，但他们只成功地宠坏了她。当他们试图管教他们任性的女儿时，她用空气元素的力量对付他们。不久之后，她的梦将她带到了古老的矮人遗迹，那里有长矛风神在等着她。",

	"As a practitioner of the arcane arts who learned much of his fire magic from Vanifer herself, Bastian relies on his spells in a fight, and he is a \"quick-burning\" sort who tries to deliver maximum impact early in the fight.

	"Black Earth guards are the warriors of the earth cult. They are brutal, heavily armored thugs devoted to Ogrémoch. That devotion has granted them an uncanny ability to hold their ground against the buffeting assaults. It has also earned them the right to wear special plate armor of elemental stone, which breaks down when the guard is slain.": "黑土卫士是大地邪教的战士。他们是残暴的、全副武装的暴徒，献身于奥格雷莫赫。这种献身精神赋予了他们一种不可思议的能力，使他们能够坚守阵地，抵御猛烈的攻击。这也为他们赢得了穿戴特殊的元素石板甲的权利，当卫兵被杀时，板甲会被分解。",

	"The priests of the Black Earth are the drivers and organizers of Ogrémoch's cult. They are the true believers, seeing Ogrémoch as a divine force, and they have developed a twisted dogma to explain how the evil of elemental earth is destined to remake the world and rule over all. The Black Earth priests form a cabal of leaders whose fanaticism and magical power serve as the backbone of the cult. Individuals of unusual power hold higher rank in the cult, but the priests provide the cult leader with his or her authority over the rest of Ogrémoch's followers.": "黑土的祭司是奥格雷莫赫邪教的推动者和组织者。他们是真正的信徒，将奥格雷莫克视为神圣的力量，他们制定了一个扭曲的教条，解释地球元素的邪恶是如何注定要重塑世界并统治一切。黑土祭司形成了一个由领袖组成的阴谋集团，他们的狂热和魔法力量成为邪教的支柱。权力不凡的人在邪教中拥有更高的地位，但祭司们为邪教领袖提供了他或她对奥格雷莫赫其他追随者的权威。",

	"Crushing Wave priests are the fanatical core of the cult. Gathering in secretive cabals, they perform dark rituals to glorify Olhydra as the embodiment of water's destructiveness. They believe that using water to kill their enemies, such as through ritual drowning, earns them Olhydra's favor.": "碎浪派的祭司是邪教的狂热核心。他们聚集在秘密的小团体中，举行黑暗的仪式，颂扬奥海德拉是水的破坏性的化身。他们相信利用水来杀死他们的敌人，比如通过溺水仪式，可以获得奥海德拉的青睐。",
	"The foot soldiers of the Crushing Wave cult are vicious sea reavers. Many of them were pirates before they fell in with the cult, and they remain eager for blood and plunder.

The soldiers of the Crushing Wave cult are highly loyal to the cult priests, but they rarely fight to the death if an avenue of retreat is open to them.": "碎浪神教的步兵是邪恶的海上掠夺者。他们中的许多人在加入邪教之前是海盗，他们仍然渴望着鲜血和掠夺。碎浪神教的人很欣赏隐蔽和出其不意的价值，并尽可能寻找机会从隐蔽的位置发动突然袭击。碎浪神教的士兵对神教的牧师高度忠诚，但如果有退路的话，他们很少会拼死抵抗。",

	"Dark Tide knights are the elite warriors of the Crushing Wave cult. By drawing upon Olhydra's dark power, they gain the ability to ride sea-creatures that normally wouldn't be suitable as mounts, and can even breathe underwater and share their mount's senses. The knights prefer to fight from or in the water, since they don't like to leave their mounts behind, but they can be fierce opponents on foot at need.": "暗潮骑士是碎浪教派的精英战士。通过汲取奥海德拉的黑暗力量，他们获得了骑乘通常不适合作为坐骑的海洋生物的能力，甚至可以在水下呼吸并分享他们坐骑的感官。骑士们更喜欢在水中作战，因为他们不喜欢离开他们的坐骑，但在必要时，他们也可以成为徒步的激烈对手。",

	"Drannin is a self-serving dwarf who has always felt that, due to his heritage, he was owed better than he received. When he didn't receive the accolades, he began to see everyone in his way as the problem, trying to keep him down, and he vowed to do whatever it took to turn the tables. He is currently intent on claiming the legendary axe Orcsplitter, the weapon buried with King Torhild Flametongue of Besilmer many centuries ago. The secret doors and puzzles of the Halls of the Hunting Axe have frustrated Drannin for a long time, but he now has a plan to dupe his cousin Gargosh into finding the axe for him (see the \"Halls of the Hunting Axe\" side trek in chapter 6). Drannin believes that with Orcsplitter in his possession he can establish himself as a powerful lord among his clan, and finally win the respect he thinks he deserves.": "德兰宁是一个自以为是的矮人，他一直觉得，由于他的遗产，他应该得到的比他得到的更好。当他没有得到赞誉的时候，他开始把挡在他面前的每个人都看成是问题，试图把他压下去，他发誓要不惜一切代价扭转局面。他目前一心想要得到传说中的斧头Orcsplitter，这把武器在许多世纪前与贝西尔默的托希尔德-弗拉梅通格国王一起埋葬。猎斧大厅的暗门和谜题让德兰宁沮丧了很久，但他现在有了一个计划，欺骗他的表弟加戈什为他找到那把斧头（见第6章中的 \"猎斧大厅 \"侧面的跋涉）。德兰宁相信，有了兽人分身，他就能在部族中建立起自己强大的领主地位，并最终赢得他认为自己应得的尊重。",

They light things aflame to honor elemental fire and just for entertainment, but they don't always think ahead about what else nearby might catch fire.": "永恒之火的守护者是被火的力量所吸引的呆子，渴望向邪教的敌人展示燃烧的第一手感觉。他们点燃东西以纪念火元素，也只是为了娱乐，但他们并不总是提前考虑到附近还有什么东西可能会着火。",
	"Eternal Flame priests see the world around them as impure and unworthy, and believe that only cleansing by fire can set it right. As a result, all fire is deemed holy, from the smallest candle flame to the greatest conflagrations. When traveling in the open, Eternal Flame priests are clever enough to hide their true beliefs, passing themselves off as druids or wizards with a knack for fire magic.": "永恒之火祭司认为他们周围的世界是不纯洁和不值得的，并相信只有通过火的清洗才能将其纠正。因此，所有的火都被视为神圣的，从最小的烛火到最大的火焰。在公开场合旅行时，永恒之火的牧师很聪明，可以隐藏他们的真实信仰，把自己伪装成德鲁伊或精通火魔法的巫师。",
	"Fathomers are cultists who have sealed a pact with Olhydra, Princess of Evil Water. In addition to their spellcasting abilities, fathomers have the ability to transform their bodies into water, taking serpent-like shapes. In their water serpent forms, fathomers gain many of the resistances elemental creatures possess, as well as the ability to grapple and crush their enemies with their watery bodies.": "深海鱼人是与邪水公主奥海德拉（Olhydra）签订了契约的邪教徒。除了他们的法术能力之外，水蛇人还有能力将他们的身体转化为水，形成类似于蛇的形状。在他们的水蛇形态中，法索玛人获得了许多元素生物所拥有的抵抗力，以及用他们水一样的身体抓取和压碎敌人的能力。",
	"Fathomers often serve as spies, infiltrators, and assassins for the water cult, since they can slip under locked doors or pass through bars and similar obstacles with ease.": "法索玛人经常充当水神教的间谍、潜入者和暗杀者，因为他们可以从上锁的门下溜走，或者轻松地穿过铁栅栏和类似的障碍。",

	"The knights are contemptuous of other elemental cultists, whom they view as depraved lunatics. Under lord commander Thurl Merosska, the Feathergale Knights see themselves as elite men and women who can make hard choices for the good of their realms.

Despite their refined manners and social sophistication, each has sealed that pact with the murder of a sentient being-deaths the knights have dubbed necessary for the security of the realm.": "骑士们蔑视其他元素崇拜者，他们认为这些人是堕落的疯子。在主指挥官Thurl Merosska的领导下，Feathergale骑士将自己视为精英，能够为他们的王国做出艰难的选择。在现实中，他们被Yan-C-Bin所束缚，对自己的腐败和堕落视而不见。尽管他们彬彬有礼，社交能力强，但每个人都通过谋杀一个有生命的人来封印这个契约--骑士们认为为了王国的安全，这些人的死亡是必要的。",

	"Initiates live on little but air for a month, believing that this regimen purifies them of bodily needs. In truth it makes their bodies so desperate for sustenance that they become susceptible to indoctrination.

	"Howling Hatred priests see themselves as living extensions of Yan-C-Bin, and they help new recruits cast off the shackles of their old lives and embrace a \"higher purpose.\" Once the new recruits are thus purified, the priests decide whether they are worthy for indoctrination as initiates or would better serve the Howling Hatred cult as sacrifices. The priests also uphold the doctrine of their prophet, inoth, and harshly punish any initiate who strays from the path.": "嚎叫之恨的祭司们把自己看作是阎王爷的活生生的延伸，他们帮助新招募的人摆脱旧生活的桎梏，拥抱 \"更高的目标\"。一旦新兵得到净化，祭司们就会决定他们是否值得被灌输为入门者，或者作为祭品更好地服务于嚎叫之恨邪教。祭司们还坚持他们的先知伊诺斯的教义，并严厉惩罚任何偏离道路的入门者。",

Sometimes known as the Crushing Wave, the Dark Tide, or the Well of Endless Anguish, she takes the form of a great wave, 20 feet high and 15 feet wide, with opalescent eyes. She prefers to remain in or near large bodies of water-seas, lakes, rivers, or sometimes great subterranean pools. When she needs to, she can surge onto dry land, moving much like a wave rushing up onto the shore, but only great anger or desperation would drive Olhydra to move more than a few hundred feet from her native element.": "奥海德拉是邪恶之水的公主。她有时被称为 \"碎浪\"、\"暗潮 \"或 \"无尽的痛苦之井\"，她的形态是一个大浪，高20英尺，宽15英尺，有乳白色的眼睛。她喜欢呆在大型水体中或附近--海洋、湖泊、河流，或者有时是巨大的地下水池。当她需要的时候，她可以涌上干燥的陆地，就像波浪冲上岸一样，但只有巨大的愤怒或绝望才会驱使奥海德拉离开她的原生元素超过几百英尺。",
	"Olhydra surges forth tirelessly and relentlessly. She delights in creating dangerous and destructive manifestations of elemental water, especially maelstroms and floods. She is eager to assert her power by smashing any vessel that dares to venture into her realm, and lays waste to villages or towns established within her reach. Olhydra erodes that which she can't batter and drown; she is patient, retreating in the face of adversity only to return stronger than before.": "奥海德拉不知疲倦地、无情地涌现出来。她乐于创造危险和破坏性的水元素表现，尤其是漩涡和洪水。她渴望通过粉碎任何敢于冒险进入她的领域的船只来宣示她的力量，并对在她范围内建立的村庄或城镇造成浪费。奥尔海德拉会侵蚀那些她无法打击和淹没的东西；她很有耐心，在面对困境时，她会退缩，但会比以前更强大。",
	"Of all the Princes of Elemental Evil, Olhydra is the one most interested in mortals. She recognizes that pirates and raiders who redden the waters with mortal blood (and occasionally send treasure-laden ships into her clutches) are agents of her hateful outlook, whether they know it or not. Consequently, Olhydra sometimes spares the worst sort of seafarers from her wrath, patiently waiting for the day when they deliver others into her power.": "在所有邪恶元素的王子中，奥海德拉是对凡人最感兴趣的一个。她认识到，那些用凡人的鲜血染红海水的海盗和掠夺者（偶尔也会将满载财宝的船只送入她的魔掌）是她可憎观点的代理人，无论他们是否知道。因此，奥海德拉有时会从她的愤怒中放过最坏的那种海员，耐心地等待着他们将其他人送入她的势力范围的那一天。",
	"The Princess of Evil Water is native to the Elemental Plane of Water, where she can be found in the black depths of vast seas or enthroned among jagged reefs. Olhydra waits for the chance to enter the Material Plane through elemental water nodes or when called by the proper rituals. Whether she is in her elemental domain or temporarily occupying a water node, Olhydra commands the waters around her and can shape them to her will.": "恶水公主原产于水元素界，在那里她可以在广阔的海洋的黑色深处或在嶙峋的珊瑚礁中被发现。奥海德拉等待机会，通过水元素节点或在适当的仪式召唤下进入物质界。无论她是在她的元素领域还是暂时占据一个水结点，奥海德拉都能指挥她周围的水域，并能按照她的意愿塑造它们。",
	"A one-eyed shiver is a fearsome cultist who wields powers of ice and cold. To gain the frigid power of elemental water, the shiver removes one eye and replaces it with a frosty white orb that can blast foes with an icy ray. When the orb isn't in use, the shiver covers its magical eye with an eye patch. Even when hidden, the orb's magical power makes itself felt-a one-eyed shiver has ice-cold blood and is constantly surrounded by an aura of thin, cold fog.": "独眼颤抖者是一个可怕的邪教徒，拥有冰和冷的力量。为了获得水元素的冰冷力量，颤抖者摘下一只眼睛，用一个冰冷的白色球体代替它，可以用冰冷的射线轰击敌人。当球体不被使用时，颤抖者会用眼罩遮住它的魔眼。即使隐藏起来，球体的魔力也能让人感觉到--独眼的颤栗者拥有冰冷的血液，并不断被薄薄的冷雾所包围。",
	"One-eyed shivers inspire dread and fear in all who meet them, including their fellow cultists. Only the leaders of the Crushing Wave cult dare to give commands to these masters of icy magic.": "独眼的颤抖激发了所有见到他们的人的恐惧和害怕，包括他们的邪教成员。只有碎浪邪教的领袖才敢向这些冰冷的魔法大师发出命令。",
	"A lean, black-bearded young noble from Baldur's Gate, Oreioth is more at home among the dead than the living. He was cruel almost from the time he could talk, catching small creatures and killing them in hideously inventive ways to savor the power of life and death. He grew to be an embarrassment to his well-off family, who paid a tutor to channel his undeniable intelligence and curiosity into more positive outlets. They didn't know they had apprenticed the young Oreioth to a necromancer in need of an assistant for his researches.": "一个来自博德之门的精瘦、黑胡子的年轻贵族，Oreioth在死人中比在活人中更自在。他几乎从会说话的时候起就很残忍，捕捉小动物并以狰狞的方式杀死它们，品味生与死的力量。他逐渐成为他的富裕家庭的一个尴尬，他们花钱请了一个家庭教师，把他不可否认的智慧和好奇心引导到更积极的渠道。他们不知道他们已经把这个年轻的Oreioth教给了一个需要助手进行研究的死灵法师。",
	"When Oreioth's master decided he had no more use for his apprentice, he sent Oreioth off to make his own way in the world. Oreioth worked his way northward, robbing graves and using his magic to intimidate or rob anyone weaker than him. Driven out of one decent town after another, he finally sought refuge in an old outlaw's lair he discovered near Lance Rock. There he commenced his newest round of experiments, avoiding all other living souls.": "当Oreioth的主人决定他对他的学徒没有更多的利用价值时，他把Oreioth送走，让他在这个世界上走自己的路。Oreioth一路向北，抢劫坟墓，用他的魔法来恐吓或抢劫任何比他弱小的人。他被赶出一个又一个体面的城镇，最后在兰斯岩附近发现的一个老逃犯的巢穴里寻求庇护。在那里，他开始了他最新一轮的实验，避开了所有其他活人。",
	"What few social graces Oreioth once possessed are fading rapidly. He has become a megalomaniac, styling himself the Lord of Lance Rock and surrounding himself with zombies and skeletons compelled to heed his every whim. Oreioth barely recognizes his own name anymore, and he harbors dreams of founding a kingdom of undead servitors with himself on the throne.": "奥里欧斯曾经拥有的为数不多的社交礼仪正在迅速消退。他已经成为一个自大狂，把自己称为兰斯岩的主宰，周围的僵尸和骷髅被迫听从他的每一个要求。Oreioth几乎不认识自己的名字了，他梦想着建立一个由亡灵仆人组成的王国，并由他自己担任王位。",
	"A razerblast seethes with hate for the enemies of the fire cult. The razerblast's elemental overlords have replaced its heart with a flaming orb that detonates if the razerblast dies.": "一台雷泽爆裂机对火神教的敌人充满了仇恨。火焰喷射器的元素霸主用一个火焰球代替了它的心脏，如果火焰喷射器死亡，它就会被引爆。",
	"Razerblasts remember little of their life before they the power of elemental fire transformed them. Now they follow the orders of the flamewraths and the cult leaders without question. Razerblasts fight confidently because they know that even if they lose, they go out in a blaze of glory.": "在火元素的力量改造他们之前，Razerblasts对他们的生活几乎没有印象。现在，他们毫无疑义地听从火焰之神和邪教领袖的命令。火焰喷射者自信地战斗，因为他们知道即使他们输了，他们也会在荣耀的火焰中死去。",
	"Sacred Stone monks are followers of a martial philosophy that seeks to emulate the strength of rock and stone. They don gargoyle masks and use a finely honed sense of touch to measure their surroundings by contact with the ground. They avoid speaking, or extraneous thought for that matter. They live only to test themselves with deprivation and to punish those who doubt the strength of elemental earth.": "圣石僧侣是一种武术哲学的追随者，旨在模仿岩石和石头的力量。他们戴着石像鬼的面具，用精细磨练的触觉通过与地面的接触来测量周围的环境。他们避免说话，或不相干的思考。他们活着只是为了用匮乏来考验自己，并惩罚那些怀疑土元素力量的人。",
	"A plump water genasi armed with a jovial manner and biting sense of humor, Shoalar Quanderil seems like the last person one would expect to be a cruel member of a destructive cult. Nevertheless, Shoalar is the captain of a pirate ship that harries the Sword Coast, and a high-ranking Crushing Wave cultist. He sees Olhydra's power as a means to making himself as rich as possible.": "作为一个丰满的水系精灵，Shoalar Quanderil有着欢快的态度和尖锐的幽默感，他似乎是人们最不愿意看到的破坏性邪教的残酷成员。然而，肖勒是一艘骚扰剑海岸的海盗船的船长，也是一名高级的碎浪教教徒。他将奥海德拉的力量视为使自己尽可能富有的手段。",
	"Skyweavers brim with rage and desire, which makes them perfect vessels for the wildly destructive magic of the Cult of the Howling Hatred. In contrast to their hurricane counterparts in the air cult, skyweavers embrace the worship of Elemental Evil for a quick path to power. With little experience wielding the might of the elements, skyweavers thrill with the rush of releasing raw elemental energy.": "天空编织者充满了愤怒和欲望，这使他们成为嚎叫之恨教派疯狂破坏性魔法的完美容器。与他们在空气邪教中的飓风同行相比，织空者接受了对元素邪恶的崇拜，以便快速获得力量。由于没有挥舞元素之力的经验，织空者对释放原始元素能量的冲动感到兴奋。",
	"Stonemelders are spellcasters who gain their power from Ogrémoch, using elemental earth magic to sheathe their bodies in carapaces of rock. They are elite champions of the cult and answer only to the cult leaders. Not even the Black Earth priests tell stonemelders what to do.": "石匠是从奥格雷莫赫那里获得力量的施法者，他们使用土元素魔法将自己的身体包裹在岩石的外壳里。他们是邪教的精英冠军，只对邪教领袖负责。甚至黑土祭司也不会告诉石匠该怎么做。",

	"Thurl Merosska is the leader of the Feathergale Knights. Once a griffon rider of Waterdeep, Thurl retired after a storm nearly claimed his life.

	"When Aerisi Kalinoth arose as the chosen prophet of air, Thurl reluctantly pledged the Feathergale Knights to the cause.

	"Vanifer's rough childhood has hardened her heart against others. The world is a corrupt, painful place, she thinks, and deserving of a fiery end. For years, she was a dancer and concubine in a pasha's court in Calimshan. Later, she took up the mantle of prophet when she found Tinderstrike, and the same ruthless ambition and practiced manipulation that enabled her to escape a life of servitude serves her well as the head of a growing cult.": "瓦尼法的坎坷童年使她对别人的心变硬。她认为，这个世界是一个腐败的、痛苦的地方，应该有一个火热的结局。多年来，她在卡里姆山的一个帕夏宫廷里做舞女和妾室。后来，当她找到Tinderstrike时，她接过了先知的衣钵，同样无情的野心和熟练的操纵使她能够摆脱奴役的生活，这对她成为一个不断增长的邪教的首领很有帮助。",
	"For Vanifer, battle is best observed at a distance. She prefers to hurl destructive magic from afar. Those who challenge Vanifer in melee learn a painful lesson, as she and Tinderstrike make a formidable pair.": "对瓦尼法来说，战斗最好在远处观察。她更喜欢从远处投掷破坏性的魔法。那些在近战中挑战瓦尼法的人都会得到一个痛苦的教训，因为她和灰烬之矛是一对可怕的组合。",

	"Wiggan Nettlebee is the patriarch of the Nettlebee clan, a wealthy family of halflings that raise livestock and farm their land. He presents the outward appearance of a modest rancher, and he forbids extravagance on his farm.

He still doesn't know the full extent of the cult's plans.": "威根-奈特比是奈特比家族的族长，这是一个富裕的半身人家庭，他们饲养牲畜并耕种土地。他呈现出一个谦虚的牧场主的外在形象，他禁止在他的农场上奢侈。维根认为自己找到了一个致力于支配自然和利用其黑暗面的邪教，于是加入了黑土教。他仍然不知道该邪教的全部计划。",
	"Wiggan dislikes and distrusts outsiders. He believes they are all evildoers who would steal from him if they could.

A greedy miser, Wiggan becomes visibly upset at the thought of parting with even a few spare coins from his hoard.": "维根不喜欢和不信任外人。他认为他们都是邪恶的人，如果可以的话，他们会从他那里偷东西。他认为地球上的邪教是一个强大而必要的盟友，以确保他的财务状况和维持他的地位。作为一个贪婪的守财奴，维根一想到要从他的囤积物中拿出几枚零钱，就会明显感到不安。",
	"An opportunistic half-moon elf rake and bandit formerly known as Harald Grayspear, Windharrow was given his new name by Aerisi Kalinoth.

	"At Aerisi's insistence, Windharrow recruited a band of flutists from the ranks of new converts to the air cult, calling them the Windwyrds. Most have no musical talent whatsoever, and their music is often a shrill cacophony. Of all the air cultists, the Windwyrds are the least fanatical and the most fearful for their lives. Aerisi disposes of these minstrels on a whim, replacing them with other initiates. Those that master some skill with their instruments survive the longest, but the cost of failure creates a highly competitive environment among the minstrels.": "在爱里西的坚持下，温德哈罗从新皈依空气邪教的队伍中招募了一队长笛手，称他们为Windwyrds。大多数人没有任何音乐天赋，他们的音乐往往是一种尖锐的喧闹声。在所有的空气崇拜者中，Windwyrds是最不狂热的，也是最担心自己生命的。爱丽斯随心所欲地处置这些吟游诗人，用其他入门者取代他们。那些掌握了一些乐器技能的人存活时间最长，但失败的代价在吟游诗人中创造了一个高度竞争的环境。",

	"His natural form is an invisible vortex of howling, swirling air 30 feet high and 15 feet wide, but Yan-C-Bin sometimes takes the shape of a gaunt, venerable, dark-skinned human with wispy white hair and glowing white eyes. When he wishes to remain unseen, Yan-C-Bin manifests only as a gust of cold wind flowing silently past.": "他的自然形态是一个无形的漩涡，由咆哮的空气组成，高30英尺，宽15英尺，但Yan-C-Bin有时会变成一个憔悴的、可敬的、皮肤黝黑的人类，有着飘逸的白发和闪亮的白眼。当他想保持不被发现时，Yan-C-Bin只表现为一阵冷风，静静地流过。",
