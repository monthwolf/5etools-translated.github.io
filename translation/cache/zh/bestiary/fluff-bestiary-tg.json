	"Edgin Darvis has a talent for improvisation and strategy. He's a musician and tale-teller who relies on charisma first—rather than magic or muscle—to escape trouble. Once a member of the Harpers, a spy organization dedicated to protecting Faerûn's common folk, Edgin has forsworn his oath and turned to thievery to support his family. Edgin's strong moral compass compels him to steal only from people he believes deserve to lose both coin and face.": "埃德金-达维斯在即兴创作和战略方面有天赋。他是一个音乐家和讲故事的人，他首先依靠魅力--而不是魔法或肌肉来逃避麻烦。埃德金曾经是哈珀斯的成员，这是一个致力于保护法鲁恩平民的间谍组织，但他放弃了自己的誓言，转而从事偷窃以支持他的家庭。埃德金强烈的道德观迫使他只从他认为应该失去钱财和面子的人那里偷东西。",

	"Simon Aumar suffers under the weight of his family name.
