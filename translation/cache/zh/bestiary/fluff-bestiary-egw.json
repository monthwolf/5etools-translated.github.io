	"Resembling some sort of canine or feline quadruped at a distance, the absorber's monstrous nature becomes quickly apparent as it closes in. Named for its ability to draw magical energy into its body, the absorber can release that energy in devastating blasts through its tail, whose eye is constantly on the lookout for prey.": "吸收者在远处像某种犬科或猫科的四足动物，当它接近时，它的怪异性质很快就会显现出来。吸收者因其将魔法能量吸入体内的能力而得名，它可以通过它的尾巴释放出破坏性的能量，而它的眼睛一直在寻找猎物。",
	"Brought to life by mages in the flying city of Aeor during the Age of Arcanum, Aeorian hunters were created to take on angels, demons, devils, fey, and the gods themselves. When Aeor crashed into Eiselcross, many of these magically mutated monstrosities survived, and they now stalk Aeor's ruins and the islands' icy wastes.": "在阿卡诺姆时代，法师们在飞行城市Aeor创造了生命，Aeorian猎人被创造出来，用来对付天使、恶魔、魔鬼、精灵和神灵本身。当流星坠落到艾瑟克罗斯时，许多经过魔法变异的怪物幸存了下来，他们现在在流星的废墟和岛屿的冰原上徘徊。",
	"Aeorian hunters were created through arcane experimentation on beasts and humanoids—both captives and volunteers. These experiments resulted in monstrosities with brightly colored flesh and the power to resist and destroy Aeor's enemies. It is theorized that the mages of Aeor must have possessed some means of controlling their monstrous soldiers, but no such device has yet been found in the wastes of Eiselcross. Draconic was the language used by these mages to train and bind the Aeorian hunters, and the hunters retain an understanding of this language even though they can't speak it.": "Aeorian猎手是通过对野兽和人类--包括俘虏和志愿者--进行神秘的实验而产生的。这些实验的结果是具有鲜艳的肉体和抵抗和摧毁Aeor敌人的力量的怪兽。据推测，Aeor的法师们一定拥有一些控制他们的怪物士兵的手段，但在Eiselcross的荒原上还没有发现这种装置。Draconic是这些法师用来训练和束缚Aeorian猎人们的语言，猎人们虽然不能说这种语言，但仍然对这种语言保持理解。",
	"Aeorian hunters do not age. As such, the lust for violence their creators instilled in their minds has grown ravenous after centuries without war. Most immediately attack any creature they see.": "Aeorian猎手不会衰老。因此，他们的创造者在他们的头脑中灌输的暴力欲望在几个世纪没有战争之后变得贪婪起来。大多数人看到任何生物都会立即攻击。",
	"Though they crave violence, Aeorian hunters have never been seen attacking each other. Most scholars believe that Aeor's mages must have enchanted this behavior into them, given the cost in gold and magic required to create each hunter. Some adventurers in Eiselcross boast about sneaking past Aeorian hunters using disguises or illusions to mimic a hunter's form, but these are most likely tall tales.": "虽然他们渴望暴力，但从来没有人看到Aeorian猎人互相攻击。大多数学者认为，Aeor的法师一定是把这种行为灌输给了他们，因为创造每个猎人需要花费大量的黄金和魔法。在艾瑟克罗斯的一些冒险者吹嘘说，他们用伪装或幻觉来模仿猎人的形态，偷偷摸摸地躲过了流星猎人，但这些都很可能是虚构的故事。",
	"Each Aeorian hunter has perfect recall of every experience since the moment of its creation. Their limited intellects and desire for violence prevent them from effectively communicating, but each hunter holds a wealth of knowledge—often including the location of rare Aeorian relics—inside its mind.": "每个Aeorian猎人都能完美地回忆起自其被创造的那一刻起的每一段经历。他们有限的智力和对暴力的渴望使他们无法有效地交流，但每个猎人的脑海中都有丰富的知识，通常包括稀有的Aeorian遗物的位置。",
	"Aeorian hunters don't require food or drink.": "Aeorian猎手不需要食物或饮料。",
	"Nullifiers are the bane of all magic users, with their physical forms and innate powers shaped specifically to resist and cancel magical effects. Against other foes, a nullifier is no less fearsome for the grotesque mouths filled with razor-sharp teeth that cover its torso—and which set up a cacophony of gnashing that can drive other creatures mad.": "无效者是所有魔法使用者的祸根，他们的身体形态和天生的力量专门用来抵制和取消魔法效果。对付其他敌人，无效者的可怕之处在于其覆盖在躯干上的长满剃刀般锋利牙齿的怪异嘴巴--它发出的咬合声能让其他生物发疯。",
	"A reverser is a terrible foe in melee, laying into other creatures with teeth and claw. But the chaos it imposes is more fearful by far, as its enemies' healing magic are unraveled and turned against them.": "逆转者在近战中是个可怕的敌人，用牙齿和爪子攻击其他生物。但它所造成的混乱更令人恐惧，因为它的敌人的治疗魔法被解开并被用来对付他们。",
	"A yeti's windborne howl sounds out across remote mountains, striking fear into the hearts of the scattered miners and herders that dwell there. These hulking creatures stalk alpine peaks in a ceaseless hunt for food. Their snow-white fur lets them move like ghosts against the frozen landscape. A yeti's icy simian eyes can freeze its prey in place.": "雪人的迎风嚎叫声响彻偏远山区，让居住在那里的零散矿工和牧民感到恐惧。这些笨重的生物在高山的山峰上漫步，不停地猎取食物。他们雪白的皮毛让他们在冰冷的地表上像幽灵一样移动。雪人冰冷的猿眼能将猎物冻结在原地。",
	"When Aeor fell into Foren, the impact threw a monolithic, purple crystal miles away from the crash site. The stone pierced the body of an abominable yeti named Allowak, but the crystal's magic preserved the yeti's corpse and absorbed Allowak's soul. When other yetis touched the crystal, their intellect increased and their innate desire to slaughter faded away. A society of the monstrosities living in huts and keeping mammoths for food sprung up around the crystal. These peaceful yetis abhor their more savage kin.": "当流星坠落到福伦时，冲击力将一块巨大的紫色水晶扔到了离坠落地点数英里远的地方。这块石头刺穿了一个名叫阿洛瓦克的可恶的雪人的身体，但水晶的魔力保留了雪人的尸体并吸收了阿洛瓦克的灵魂。当其他雪人接触到这块水晶时，他们的智力得到了提高，与生俱来的屠杀欲望也逐渐消失了。在水晶周围出现了一个住在小屋里、以猛犸象为食物的怪兽社会。这些和平的雪人憎恨他们更野蛮的亲属。",
	"The yetis of Allowak's Sanctuary keep their home a secret, for they worry that outsiders might try to steal the crystal. Although the crystal's effects seem permanent, the yetis fear that if it were removed from Allowak's remains, they would lose their newfound intelligence. If outsiders get close to the village, the yetis patrolling the village's borders approach and act like the more common and savage members of their species. The yetis of Allowak's Sanctuary do not kill unless forced to, but they will cause injury to guard their secret.": "阿洛瓦克圣地的雪人对他们的家保密，因为他们担心外人会试图偷走水晶。虽然水晶的效果似乎是永久性的，但雪人担心如果水晶从阿洛瓦克的遗体中被移除，他们将失去新发现的智慧。如果外人接近村子，在村子边界巡逻的雪人就会接近并表现得像他们物种中更普通和野蛮的成员。除非被迫，否则阿洛瓦克圣地的雪人不会杀人，但他们会造成伤害以保护他们的秘密。",
	"In recent years, the yetis have acquired books and journals from explorers who died close to their camp. The tomes gave the yetis an understanding of the world beyond Eiselcross.": "近年来，雪人获得了死在他们营地附近的探险家的书籍和日记。这些书籍使雪人对艾瑟克罗斯以外的世界有了了解。",
	"To mortals and monsters alike, the blood hunter is a legendary figure—a humanoid stalker said to embrace monstrous power. Long years ago, a group of mortals undertook dark rituals and alchemical experiments to gain the power of the deadliest monsters, allowing them to better hunt those monsters.": "对于凡人和怪物来说，血腥猎手是一个传奇人物--一个据说拥有滔天力量的人形跟踪者。很久以前，一群凡人进行了黑暗的仪式和炼金术实验，以获得最致命的怪物的力量，使他们能够更好地狩猎这些怪物。",
	"Blood hunters are steely on the surface, but roiling emotion lies beneath that impassive mask. Bestial fury and fathomless sorrow drive every stroke of a blood hunter's blade. Humanoids who draw the ire of a blood hunter are often in league with monsters—or the victims of a terrible misunderstanding. Such misunderstandings are tough to clear up, for blood hunters are the kind of folk to slay first and ask questions later.": "猎血人表面上坚毅，但在那张无动于衷的面具下隐藏着汹涌的情感。兽性的愤怒和深不见底的悲伤驱使着猎血者的每一刀。引起鲜血猎手愤怒的人类往往与怪物为伍，或者是一个可怕的误解的受害者。这种误解很难澄清，因为猎血人是那种先杀后问的人。",
	"A weird and deadly offshoot of the moorbounder has rows of long, bladelike bristles covering its sleek body. The creature weaponizes these blades, using them to slash nearby creatures to ribbons. However, these blades make the bristled moorbounder less suitable as a mount.": "一种怪异而致命的摩尔比目鱼的分支，其光滑的身体上覆盖着一排排长长的、类似黑色的鬃毛。这种生物将这些刀片作为武器，用它们来将附近的生物砍成丝带。然而，这些刀片使刚毛龙鱼不太适合作为坐骑。",
	"One of the many predators to stalk the marshlands and muddy foothills of Xhorhas, moorbounders are known as dangerous killers to those who try to avoid them on their travels—and as prized mounts for those willing to capture and train them. Though the process of domesticating a moorbounder is fraught with peril, these creatures can become favored hunting companions and powerful war mounts.": "沼泽地和Xhorhas的泥泞山脚下有许多掠食者，其中之一，对于那些试图在旅行中避开它们的人来说，沼泽兽是著名的危险杀手，对于那些愿意捕获和训练它们的人来说，它们是珍贵的坐骑。虽然驯养荒原犬的过程充满了危险，但这些生物可以成为人们喜爱的狩猎伙伴和强大的战争坐骑。",
	"Moorbounders hunt with elongated tusks and retractable claws. With a vague resemblance to large hunting cats, their muscular bodies are built for combat, granting them incredible prowess at leaping and a running speed that makes them dominant carnivores.": "摩尔人用修长的獠牙和可伸缩的爪子捕猎。他们与大型猎猫有几分相似，他们肌肉发达的身体是为战斗而生的，赋予他们难以置信的跳跃能力和奔跑速度，使他们成为占优势的食肉动物。",
	"The smallest and most numerous of the core spawn, these eyeless creatures scurry through the subterranean darkness with the help of their four irregular, gangly arms and hooked prehensile tails. Core spawn crawlers rarely travel alone, and a group of these agile predators is known as a vein of crawlers. Their clattering taloned limbs warn of their presence as they scuttle through the shadow-haunted depths of the earth.": "这些没有眼睛的生物是核心产卵体中最小和最多的，它们借助于四条不规则的粗壮手臂和带钩的无柄尾巴在地下的黑暗中乱窜。核心产卵体的爬行者很少单独行动，这些敏捷的捕食者组成的群体被称为爬行者的静脉。当它们在暗无天日的地底深处穿梭时，它们哗啦啦的带爪子的四肢会警告它们的存在。",
	"The Elder Evils assault the multiverse in strange and calamitous ways. Sometimes they breach the Material Plane by exploiting the unfathomable energy and darkness found in the world's depths. These terrestrial manifestations of loathsome alien agendas are known as core spawn, and they are as varied in their physiology as they are horrific.": "上古恶魔以奇怪和灾难性的方式袭击多元宇宙。有时，他们利用世界深处发现的深不可测的能量和黑暗，侵入物质世界。这些令人厌恶的外星议程的陆地表现被称为核心卵，它们的生理结构和它们的恐怖程度一样多。",
	"Their concentration in the desolate lands of Blightshore makes the core spawn a challenge to research, and many who have sought to observe or study these nightmarish entities rarely return. Those who do return are often shells of their former selves who speak of horrifying underground labyrinths of twisting caverns and malevolent nests where other denizens of the Miskath Strand are dragged below to some infernal purpose.": "它们集中在荒凉的Blightshore土地上，使得核心卵生的研究成为一种挑战，许多试图观察或研究这些噩梦般的实体的人很少回来。那些回来的人往往是他们以前的躯壳，他们说的是由扭曲的洞穴和邪恶的巢穴组成的可怕的地下迷宫，在那里，米斯卡斯河岸的其他居民被拖到下面去实现一些地狱般的目的。",
	"The aberrant creatures known as core spawn are a subterranean breed of heralds, servants, foot soldiers, and lieutenants of the Elder Evils, awakened in the depths by the cataclysmic actions of the Betrayer Gods and their minions. They often appear on the surface world in the wake of seismic events, such as that which created the bottomless Miskath Pit of Eastern Wynandir. Warlocks and cultists sometimes gather together to hasten the arrival of core spawn to the Material Plane, focusing their arcane power on areas of natural seismic instability when the signs and stars are right.": "被称为 \"核心卵 \"的反常生物是地下的使者、仆人、步兵和上古邪神的副手，他们被背叛者之神和他们的爪牙的灾难性行为唤醒。他们经常在地震事件发生后出现在地表世界，例如在东维南迪尔创造了无底的米斯卡斯坑。术士和崇拜者有时会聚集在一起，以加速核心卵子到达物质世界，在征兆和星象正确时，将他们的奥术力量集中在自然地震不稳定的地区。",
	"These airborne predators serve as assassins and sentinels for the core spawn. The terrible thrum of its insectoid wings and a chittering of mandibles announces an emissary's arrival.": "这些空中掠夺者是核心卵子的刺客和哨兵。它那可怕的昆虫翅膀的颤动和下颚的抖动宣告了使者的到来。",
	"The core spawn emissary can expel clouds of crystalline spores from tubes in its head. These spores act like a contact poison and can be deadly if inhaled.": "核心产卵使者可以从其头部的管道中排出结晶孢子云。这些孢子的作用类似于接触性毒药，如果被吸入就会致命。",
	"Core spawn seers are humanoid arcanists corrupted by the eldritch power of the Elder Evils through blasphemous rites or accursed encounters.

	"An unknown Aeorian object of immense power and mystery was uncovered and brought to the Fortress of the Dead Jarl in Eiselcross to please the ruling frost giant, Conessa Berg.

	"A frost worm spends most of its time beneath the frozen ground, conserving energy while it waits for prey to pass overhead. Smart travelers can identify a frost worm's hunting grounds by looking for recently iced-over tunnels. When the worm senses vibrations above, it bursts forth through dirt, ice, and snow. Those who escape its initial assault must still contend with the worm's haunting trill—a hypnotizing call that stops creatures in their tracks to make them easy prey.": "霜虫大部分时间都在冰冻的地面下度过，在等待猎物从头顶经过时保存能量。聪明的旅行者可以通过寻找最近结冰的隧道来确定霜虫的狩猎地点。当虫子感觉到上方的震动时，它就会从泥土、冰和雪中冲出来。那些躲过它最初攻击的人，仍然必须面对虫子那令人心烦的号角--一种催眠的叫声，它能让生物停下脚步，使它们成为轻松的猎物。",
	"Rolling, deadly whirlwinds of metal plates and curving blades, these clockwork automatons were initially designed by tinkerers and mage engineers to be sentries and guardians in the deepest of vaults during the Age of Arcanum.

Nearly fifty feet from nose to tail, and with a habit of remaining stationary for long periods, a horizonback tortoise is easy to mistake for a low hill at a distance.
