	"Aeshma is a tiefling who was born into a rich and affluent family with ties to powerful families within the city of Waterdeep. Aeshma has learned that everything in life comes easy, free, and without consequence. Aeshma is a jack of no trades and master of none, he has ceremoniously failed himself out of magic studies, countless bard colleges, church studies, and military training. Aeshma excels at one thing: convincing and manipulating others to gamble. He doesn't really care for the stakes or the outcome of a bet, rather he gets enjoyment out of the consternation of others. Aeshma is a chronic gambler who always pushes the stakes to their limits.": "Aeshma（艾什玛）是一个庭鬼，出生在一个与瓦特德普城内强大家族有联系的富裕家庭。Aeshma发现生活中的一切都是轻而易举、免费且没有后果的。Aeshma什么都会一点，但什么都不精通，他在魔法研究、无数吟游诗人学院、教会研究和军事训练中都以失败告终。Aeshma擅长一件事：说服和操纵他人赌博。他并不在乎赌注或赌局的结果，而是享受他人的困扰。Aeshma是一个慢性赌徒，总是把赌注推向极限。",
	"Aeshma was content to a life pursuing pleasure and with no responsibilities, but his infernal heritage has entangled him with something he could have never expected. He is the soul that the Halruuans call the Unmaker (Aeshma is unaware that he is the Unmaker). Asmodeus has plans for Aeshma and had one of his archdevils, Abigor, kidnap him.": "艾什玛一直过着追求快乐、没有责任的生活，但他那地狱的血统却让他卷入了一场他从未料到的事件。他就是哈鲁安人所称之为“毁灭者”的灵魂（艾什玛并不知道自己是“毁灭者”）。阿斯莫德对艾什玛有所打算，并派遣他的大执政官之一，阿比戈尔，绑架了他。",
	"Masters of torture and pain, kocrachons are some of the most respected lesser devils in the Nine Hells. Each is driven to break the greatest number of creatures during their lifespan—the bigger and more dangerous their charges, the better. The most effective kocrachons study under other torturers, or in infernal schools, to best understand the physiologies of any victim they might come across. Perhaps due to their nature as clandestine torturers, kocrachons abhor direct conflict, choosing instead to flee if given the option.": "折磨和痛苦的大师，科克拉肯(kocrachons)是九层地狱中最受尊敬的次级恶魔之一。每个科克拉肯都被驱使着在他们的一生中折磨尽可能多的生物—被指派的生物越大、越危险，他们就越高兴。最有效的科克拉肯会在其他折磨者或地狱学校下学，以最好地了解他们可能遇到的任何受害者的生理特征。也许由于他们作为秘密折磨者的本性，科克拉肯厌恶直接冲突，而是选择逃跑如果有机会的话。",
	"They're insect-like and have a brightly colored carapace, with retractable wings, multiple arms and legs, and pincer-like hands. Even their heads appear strangely insectoid, often with multiple proboscises, eyes and false eyes, and waving antennae. Kocrachon inject a lethal poison into victims and, if they acquire the information they needed, may cure said poison.": "它们类似昆虫，有着色鲜艳的甲壳，可收放的翅膀，多只手臂和腿，以及镊状的手。甚至它们的头部看起来也奇异地像昆虫，常常有多个吸管、眼睛和假眼，还有摆动的触角。科克拉克翁(Kocrachon)会向受害者注射致命毒液，如果它们获得所需信息，可能会解除这种毒素。",
	"Though they are just as comfortable in the fires of the Nine Hells as any other devil, unlike many other of their peers, kocrachons are also resilient to the cold. This makes them useful in Stygia and Cania, where they are often employed by the archdevils of those layers to wring information from recalcitrant opponents. Their affinity to the cold also provides kocrachons with other, more interesting avenues of torture.": "尽管与其他恶魔一样能够在九层地狱的火焰中感到舒适，可科克拉克恶魔与许多同类不同的是，它们对寒冷也有很强的抵抗力。这使得它们在斯提吉亚 (Stygia) 和卡尼亚 (Cania) 非常有用，经常被这些层的大恶魔雇用来从顽固的对手那里获取信息。它们对寒冷的亲和力也为科克拉克恶魔提供了其他更有趣的酷刑手段。",
	"A fierce warrior of the Heavens, Anagwendol's career is a trail of slain Fiends. She has never turned from a fight against evil, and though she has taken countless wounds in the fray, she has never lost. And now she is in the Nine Hells.": "天堂的一位凶猛战士，安娜格温多尔(Anagwendol)的职业生涯是一连串被杀死的恶魔。她从未背弃与邪恶作战的决心，尽管在战斗中受过无数伤，但从未失败。而现在她身处于九层地狱。",
	"She owes her captivity to an all-too-common fault among angels. Of all sins, they must beware of pride. Knowing that you're the very instrument of the divine and having carved your way through the inferior mettle of a thousand infernal combatants, makes it hard to hold onto humility. This pride led her into a trap and unable to leave the fourth layer—Phlegethos.": "她的囚禁归因于天使中一种太常见的过错。在所有罪恶中，他们必须警惕骄傲。知道自己是神圣的工具，并且已经在千百个地狱战士中刻出一条道路，很难保持谦卑。这种骄傲导致她陷入陷阱，无法离开第四层——(Phlegethos)。",
	"The mastermind behind the entrapment of Anagwendol was the archdevil Kordichai, whose chief interest is a grand game preserve of fiery Elemental monsters in Phlegethos. Kordichai, a canny old hunter, was able to lure her into his preserve, and there at its heart she remains, a prisoner within a blazing stone labyrinth. Occasionally Kordichai sends parties of devils (especially underlings who have disappointed him) to hunt her, and enjoys watching their failures.": "陷害Anagwendol的幕后主谋是大恶魔Kordichai，他的主要兴趣是在Phlegethos的火元素怪物大型狩猎场。Kordichai是一位狡猾的老猎人，他成功诱使她进入他的狩猎场，而她就留在那里的核心，被困在一个燃烧的石头迷宫中。偶尔，Kordichai会派遣一些恶魔小队（尤其是让他失望的手下）去追捕她，并乐在其中看着他们的失败。",
	"Anagwendol is no longer the angel she once was. Whilst the inner warrior of the divine remains, her connection to her surroundings is twisted by an infernal curse so that she believes she is forever fighting an endless swarm of enemies. Everything she encounters is perceived as a loathsome devil, fit only for cutting down.": "安娜格温多尔（Anagwendol）不再是她曾经的天使。尽管神圣内心的战士仍然存在，但她与周围环境的联系被地狱诅咒扭曲，以至于她认为自己永远在与无尽的敌人作战。她所遇到的一切都被视为可憎的恶魔，只适合被击倒。",
	"This constant one-angel war on the infernal is gradually taking its toll. Anagwendol is growing to live for it. The ferocity of shedding infernal blood is becoming an end in itself for her, rather than an unfortunate but necessary means to virtue.": "这场持续不断的对抗地狱生物的战斗逐渐开始对她产生影响。安娅格温多尔（Anagwendol）渐渐变得乐此不疲。为了消灭地狱生物而展现的凶猛已经成为她的目标，而不再只是不幸但必要的手段。",
	"You mortals should take pride in how you can make a hell out of any heaven.": "你们凡人应该为你们能把任何天堂变成地狱感到自豪。",
	"Various myths claim that Asmodeus, has existed since the dawn of time. Perhaps most intriguing among the myths is the Serpent of Law. In it, Asmodeus was initially named Ahriman and, together with his rival Jazirian, created the outer realms. Their conflict led both deities to become severely wounded, and Asmodeus lost the exchange by landing in the Nine Hells. Here, he used his allies and own strength to banish the previous inhabitants and become what he remains today—Overlord of the Nine Hells.": "有各种神话声称，阿斯莫德斯(Asmodeus)自时间的黎明以来就存在。在这些神话中最引人入胜的是《法律之蛇》。在这个神话中，阿斯莫德斯最初被称为阿里曼(Ahriman)，与他的对手贾齐利安(Jazirian)一起创造了外域。他们的冲突导致两位神明受到严重伤害，阿斯莫德斯在这场交锋中输给了贾齐利安，最终坠入了九层地狱。在那里，他利用自己的盟友和力量驱逐了先前的居民，成为了他今天所保持的身份——九层地狱的霸主。",
	"Since his time as ruler, Asmodeus has seen much upset: a trial by gods, the Blood War, and the Reckoning. Despite many attempts to oust him, Asmodeus has never left his throne—none have even gotten close. Helping cement his power are the Dark Eight, a group of pit fiends sworn to absolute loyalty that rule his armies.": "自他担任统治者以来，(阿斯莫迪斯)已经经历了许多动荡：神祗的审判，血战，以及清算。尽管有许多人试图推翻他，(阿斯莫迪斯)从未离开过他的王座——甚至没有人接近过。帮助巩固他权力的是黑暗八人组，一群宣誓绝对忠诚并统领他军队的深渊恶魔。",
	"Those that know Asmodeus would describe him as arrogant, extremely intelligent, strategic, and honorable. Whenever possible, he follows the laws and regulations (that he himself created), and rarely loses his temper. Some of his plots have taken thousands of years to come to fruition, with countless others continuing to this day. Whether his persona is genuine, or simply another tool in his plans, only Asmodeus himself knows.": "那些了解(阿斯莫迪斯)的人会描述他为傲慢、极其聪明、策略性强、以及有荣誉感。在可能的情况下，他遵循他自己制定的法律和规定，很少发脾气。他的一些阴谋策划可能花费数千年才得以实现，还有无数其他的计划至今仍在进行中。他的人格是真实的，还是只是他计划中的另一个工具，只有(阿斯莫迪斯)自己知道。",
	"Many groups pledge allegiance to Asmodeus, and being the ruler of the Nine Hells, he has a large quantity of followers and worshippers. His biggest goal, largely unknown by mortals, is the opposite—encourage disbelief in deities altogether. According to legend, instead of going to the god they refuse worship, atheists go directly to the Nine Hells. Asmodeus feeds on these souls, which give him the necessary nourishment to lick his wounds. To this end, worshippers and cults dedicated to Asmodeus frequently experience fluctuations in presence, in an attempt to push them to disbelief.": "许多团体向阿斯莫德（Asmodeus）宣誓效忠，作为九层地狱的统治者，他拥有大量的追随者和信徒。他最大的目标，很大程度上未为凡人所知，是相反的——鼓励对神明的怀疑。根据传说，无神论者不是去拜他们拒绝崇拜的神，而是直接前往九层地狱。阿斯莫德依靠这些灵魂获取必要的营养来舔舐他的伤口。为此，致力于阿斯莫德的信徒和邪教往往会经历存在的波动，试图推动他们对神明的怀疑。",
	"Some claim that his true form is that of a colossal serpent, with gaping wounds and a missing tail. However, no living creature has seen the true Asmodeus. He prefers to do business using one of his ten avatars, each a perfect gentleman, and handsome to boot. They can be identified by the Ruby Rod they each carry, an icon representative of the Dark Lord himself.": "有人声称他的真实形态是一条巨大的巨蛇，有着张开的伤口和缺失的尾巴。然而，没有任何生物见过真正的阿斯莫德斯。他更喜欢通过他的十个化身之一来做生意，每个化身都是一个完美的绅士，而且相貌英俊。他们可以通过他们所持有的红宝石权杖来识别，这是代表黑暗领主本人的标志。",
	"The master of the Nine Hells makes his lair in his citadel of Malsheem. Within its confines linger millions of devils, and all of them are subject to Asmodeus's will and whims.": "九层地狱之主将他的巢穴建在马尔辛堡垒(Malsheem)中。在这个堡垒的范围内，有数百万恶魔徘徊，它们都受阿斯莫德斯(Asmodeus)的意志和心血支配。",
	"An individual ayperobo is practically harmless, and often eaten by larger devils as a delicacy. Recognizing their weakness, ayperobos gather together and create colonies that communicate using telepathy. These swarms are much stronger, capable of holding their own even against some of the greater devils.": "一个(``ayperobo``)个体实际上是无害的，经常被更大的恶魔作为美味食用。认识到他们的弱点，(``ayperobo``)们聚集在一起，创建使用心灵感应进行交流的殖民地。这些虫群更加强大，甚至能够自己对抗一些更强大的恶魔。",
	"Their perfect communication and collective strength, coupled with their ability for flight, allow the ayperobos to easily complete tasks with which larger devils struggle. They're happy to do so, as their goal is to prove their worth and, when possible, get revenge for their abusive treatment at the hands of larger devils.": "他们完美的沟通和集体力量，再加上他们的飞行能力，使得(%num%)ayperobos(%num%)能够轻松完成那些更大的恶魔难以应付的任务。他们乐意这样做，因为他们的目标是证明自己的价值，并在可能的情况下，为更大的恶魔对他们的虐待报仇。",
	"Each member of the swarm appears as a small, devilish being, with oversized heads and sparrow-like wings. Their teeth are razor sharp, and when working together in a swarm, they can devour a Humanoid in a matter of seconds. While swarming, ayperobos appear as a thick cloud of mosquitoes or a cloud of blood—and are known to hide among such phenomena. Some swarms have the power to control a \"host\" by burrowing under its skin and manipulating it from the inside—these hosts can even be other devils.": "每个蚁群成员都呈现为一个小巧的、恶魔般的存在，拥有超大的头部和麻雀般的翅膀。它们的牙齿锋利无比，当在蚁群中协同作战时，它们可以在几秒钟内吞噬一个人形生物。在蚁群中，阿伊佩罗博斯看起来像一团蚊子或一团血的浓密云团，并且以隐藏在这种现象中而闻名。一些蚁群有能力通过在宿主的皮肤下钻洞并从内部操纵它来控制一个“宿主”——这些宿主甚至可以是其他恶魔。",
	"Baalzebul, is an archdevil and the lord of Maladomini, the seventh layer of the Nine Hells. He is known as both the Lord of Lies and the Lord of the Flies because his tightly woven web of intrigue traps even the smallest fly. In recent centuries he was cursed with a new hideous form by Asmodeus. This form earned him a new title—The Slug Archduke.": "巴尔塞布尔(Baalzebul)是一位大恶魔，也是九层地狱中第七层Maladomini的领主。他被称为谎言之主和苍蝇之主，因为他精心编织的阴谋网甚至能困住最小的苍蝇。在最近几个世纪里，他被阿斯莫德斯(Asmodeus)诅咒，获得了一个新的丑陋形态。这个形态赋予他一个新头衔——蛞蝓大公(The Slug Archduke)。",
	"Baalzebul was originally known as Triel, one of the most powerful and beautiful angels to be found in Celestia. Triel's selfish acts in the name of achieving his perfection resulted in his corruption and exile from Celestia. After his fall, Asmodeus, perhaps out of some lingering sense of sympathy, quickly promoted Baalzebul to the ranks of devilish nobility. Baalzebul's ruthless lust for power served him well and before long he not only displaced the ancient, original Lord of Maladomini but managed to become the only archdevil to rule two layers of the Nine Hells, although he ruled Malbolge through the devil Moloch.": "巴尔塞布尔（Baalzebul）最初被称为特里尔（Triel），是在天界（Celestia）中发现的最强大、最美丽的天使之一。特里尔为了追求自身的完美而犯下了自私的行为，导致他堕落并被放逐出天界。在他堕落之后，阿斯莫迪斯（Asmodeus），或许出于某种残存的同情，迅速提拔巴尔塞布尔为恶魔贵族的一员。巴尔塞布尔对权力的无情渴望使他受益匪浅，不久之后，他不仅取代了古老的原始马拉多米尼领主，还设法成为九层地狱中唯一统治两层的大恶魔，尽管他是通过恶魔莫洛克（Moloch）统治马尔博尔格（Malbolge）。",
	"However, Baalzebul's pride continued to be his undoing. When he attempted to take Asmodeus's throne, his schemes were discovered and thwarted.": "然而，巴尔塞布勒的骄傲继续导致他的失败。当他试图夺取阿斯莫迪斯的王座时，他的阴谋被发现并挫败了。",
	"Asmodeus inflicted a series of bizarre penalties upon Baalzebul. He was cursed to appear as a slug for one year per lie he had told to a devil, and any deal he struck with a mortal would result in a disaster for the participant. His castle was turned to excrement and filled with filth and his dominion of Malbolge was stripped from him.": "阿斯莫德斯对巴尔泽布尔施加了一系列奇怪的惩罚。他被诅咒为一只蜗牛，每说一个谎言给魔鬼，就要变成蜗牛一年，而他与凡人达成的任何交易都会导致参与者遭受灾难。他的城堡被变成粪便，充满污秽，他的统治地狱马尔博尔格也被剥夺了。",
	"Despite his punishments, Baalzebul is still dangerously cunning and charismatic. Even while trapped in the form of a slug, he remained the Lord of Lies, whose every deception was made with ease. Every one of his untruths is told with a specific purpose in mind, and only other devils are safe from his lies.": "尽管受到惩罚，巴尔则布尔仍然危险地狡猾和有魅力。即使被困在蜗牛的形态中，他仍然是谎言之主，每一次欺骗都轻而易举。他的每一个谎言都是出于特定目的，并且只有其他恶魔才能免受他的谎言。",
	"When dealing with enemies or unfortunate subordinates, Baalzebul generally manifests as a powerful winged creature. However, the characters are most likely to encounter this archdevil in his slug form after he has incurred Asmodeus's wrath again. The accompanying stat block works for both forms except that Baalzebul's movement in his slug form is replaced with: 20 ft., burrow 20 ft., climb 20 ft.": "当与敌人或不幸的部下打交道时，巴尔塞布尔通常会显现为一只强大的有翅膀的生物。然而，角色们很可能在他再次招惹阿斯莫德乌斯的愤怒后以他的蛞蝓形态遭遇这位大恶魔。附带的属性块适用于两种形态，唯一不同的是巴尔塞布尔在蛞蝓形态下的移动速度被替换为：20尺，潜行20尺，攀爬20尺。",
	"Baalzebul's lair resides within whichever city is the newest he has constructed.": "巴尔塞布尔的巢穴位于他最新建造的城市中。",
	"Barachiel is an aasimar that was born in the city of Elturel; a bastion of justice and symbol of good in the Forgotten Realms. His mother was the angel Zariel, the patron of Elturel. Barachiel grew up to become a Hellrider—the holy warriors that defend the city of Elturel. However, he gave up his freedom to become an agent of Mount Celestia so that he could try and save his mother. Zariel had been seduced and corrupted by Asmodeus. Now, as an archdevil, she rules the first layer of the Nine Hells.": "Barachiel (巴拉基尔) 是一位天选之人，出生在厄图雷尔（Elturel）这座正义的堡垒和忘忆之境（Forgotten Realms）中的善的象征。他的母亲是天使扎瑞尔（Zariel），厄图雷尔的守护者。Barachiel成长为一名地狱骑士——捍卫厄图雷尔的神圣战士。然而，他放弃了自由，成为了天界之山（Mount Celestia）的代理人，以便尝试拯救他的母亲。扎瑞尔被阿斯莫迪斯（Asmodeus）所诱惑和腐化。如今，作为一名大恶魔，她统治着九层地狱的第一层。",
	"Barachiel believes in justice, mercy, virtue, and compassion. Since his transformation into an angelic being, his memories of his former life have faded. However, the Hellrider Ramius was his beloved companion, and that memory has stayed with him.": "巴拉基尔（Barachiel）相信正义、仁慈、美德和同情。自从他变成天使后，他对前世的记忆已经淡去。然而，地狱骑士拉米乌斯（Hellrider Ramius）是他心爱的伙伴，这段记忆一直留在他心中。",
	"From his bastion, Zariel's second-in-command and the former lord of Avernus oversees the forges that furnish weapons and armor for the Blood War. Though Asmodeus has instructed Zariel to accept Bel as her advisor, Bel and Zariel loathe each other and invent distractions to keep them apart.": "在扎瑞艾尔(Zariel)的堡垒中，阿弥瑟德斯(Asmodeus)的副手和前阿维努斯(Avernus)领主监督为血战(Blood War)提供武器和盔甲的锻造工作。尽管阿弥瑟德斯指示扎瑞艾尔接受贝尔(Bel)作为她的顾问，但贝尔和扎瑞艾尔彼此憎恨，他们会制造干扰来保持彼此间的距离。",
	"Bel outwardly plays the role of Zariel's loyal vassal. However, Bel rankles at Zariel's rulership of the layer of the Nine Hells that was once his, but he won't challenge her directly as long as he thinks Asmodeus supports Zariel.": "贝尔在外表上扮演着扎瑞尔（Zariel）忠诚的属臣角色。然而，贝尔对扎瑞尔统治曾经属于他的九层地狱领域感到恼火，但只要他认为阿斯莫迪斯（Asmodeus）支持扎瑞尔，他就不会直接挑战她。",
	"If you have run {@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA}, then Bel might have replaced Zariel as the ruler of Avernus. If so, his lair is the Bronze Citadel instead of the Forge.": "如果你已经进行了{@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA}，那么贝尔(Bel)可能已经取代扎瑞尔(Zariel)成为阿弗努斯(Avernus)的统治者。如果是这样的话，他的巢穴是青铜城堡(Bronze Citadel)，而不是锻炉(Forge)。",
	"Bel makes his lair in an ancient volcano known as the Forge.": "贝尔(Bel)将他的巢穴建在一个被称为锻造炉(The Forge)的古老火山中。",
	"Belial maintains his image as the most carnal of all archdevils, and enjoys inflicting pain as much as experiencing pleasure. Despite his indulgences, Belial demonstrates charisma, passion, and intelligence, and is almost always scheming. He is confident to a fault, with vanity and desire being his greatest weaknesses.": "贝利亚尔保持着作为所有大恶魔中最肉欲的形象，并且喜欢施加痛苦与享受快乐一样。尽管他放纵自己，贝利亚尔展现出魅力、激情和智慧，几乎总是在策划阴谋。他自信到了自负的地步，虚荣和欲望是他最大的弱点。",
	"Phlegethos has been ruled by Belial, together with his daughter, Fierna, for almost as long as Dispater has ruled his Iron City. Belial considers himself an \"old school\" devil, alongside his friendly rivals Levistus and Dispater. Glasya's recent rise to power has him concerned for his continued relevance in the political landscape, forcing him to direct his scheming inwards.": "费莱戈斯（Phlegethos）由贝利亚（Belial）和他的女儿菲尔娜（Fierna）统治，几乎和迪斯帕特（Dispater）统治他的铁城一样长。贝利亚认为自己是一个“老派”恶魔，与他友好的竞争对手莱维斯塔斯（Levistus）和迪斯帕特一起。格拉西娅（Glasya）最近的崛起让他担心自己在政治格局中的持续影响力，迫使他将阴谋导向内部。",
	"During the Reckoning, Belial remained relatively neutral, until the end, when he allied with Baalzebul. Some argue that his alliance was just another scheme meant to misdirect Asmodeus—an idea further cemented when, instead of being deposed, Belial was forced to cede the throne to his daughter. For a time, he continued to rule from the shadows, but influence from Glasya on Fierna has encouraged the fiery lord to rule in tandem. Belial manages much of the political and official sides of the realm, including maintaining the infernal court. He occasionally sends avatars to other planes, which quickly seek out pleasure before continuing their assigned task.": "在清算期间，贝利亚尔一直保持相对中立，直到最后，他与巴尔泽布尔结盟。一些人认为他的联盟只是另一个旨在误导阿斯莫迪厄斯的计划，这个想法在贝利亚尔不被罢黜而被迫将王位让给女儿时进一步得到确认。有一段时间，他继续在暗中统治，但格拉西亚对菲尔娜的影响鼓励这位火焰领主共同统治。贝利亚尔管理着领域的许多政治和官方方面，包括维护地狱法庭。他偶尔会派遣化身到其他位面，这些化身会迅速寻找快乐，然后继续他们的任务。",
	"Similar to his daughter, Belial remains one of the most attractive archdevils. His rugged good looks and masculine physique serve to compliment his devilish features, of which he has many. Sharp horns and glowing eyes adorn his face, with midnight-black wings and a tail decorating the rest of his body. Depending on his mood, Belial's skin either takes on an ashy-grey complexion, or smolders red like dying coal. Priding himself on his sensual appearance, Belial dresses provocatively while maintaining high fashion, truly embodying his carnal desires.": "与他的女儿相似，贝利亚尔 (Belial) 仍然是最具吸引力的大恶魔之一。他粗犷的俊俏外表和男性化的体魄与他邪恶的特征相辅相成。他脸上长着尖角和闪烁的眼睛，午夜黑色的翅膀和尾巴装点着他的身体其他部位。根据他的心情，贝利亚尔的皮肤会呈现灰色或者像燃烧的煤炭一样炽热的红色。贝利亚尔以他撩人的外表为傲，穿着挑逗性感的服装，同时保持高级时尚，真正体现了他肉欲的欲望。",
	"This fierce archdevil currently makes his lair in an obsidian palace built within the confines of Abriymoch, but his reach extends throughout the entirety of the city.": "这位凶猛的大恶魔目前居住在阿布里莫克(Abriymoch)范围内建造的黑曜石宫殿中，但他的影响力遍及整个城市。",
	"One of the stronger greater devils, the paeliryon focus on corruption and obtaining mortal souls. While they can be found on almost every layer of the Nine Hells, paeliryons are particularly prominent in Dis and Malbolge, where they hold positions of power. Their duties include managing lesser devils, directing and manipulating the soul trade, and infernal politics. They're particularly talented at blackmailing and spying—abilities used both within and without the Nine Hells.": "作为更强大的大恶魔之一，(paeliryon)专注于腐化和获取凡间灵魂。虽然它们几乎可以在九层地狱的每一层找到，但(paeliryons)在(Dis)和(Malbolge)尤为显著，它们在那里拥有权力地位。它们的职责包括管理次等恶魔、指导和操纵灵魂交易以及地狱政治。它们特别擅长敲诈和间谍活动——这些能力在九层地狱内外都被使用。",
	"As greater devils, paeliryons are particularly large, often weighing more than 4000 pounds. Like hags, their skin is covered in boils and warts of varying colors, and they have massive bellies and leathery wings. Despite their physical drawbacks, corruption devils are quite formidable in combat. Rather than fight themselves, however, they use followers and lesser devils as fodder.": "作为更大的恶魔，帕里里翁（paeliryons）通常体型庞大，体重常超过4000磅。像巫婆一样，它们的皮肤布满各种颜色的疖子和疣，拥有庞大的腹部和皮翼。尽管存在身体上的缺陷，腐化恶魔在战斗中相当强大。然而，它们并不亲自战斗，而是利用追随者和次级恶魔作为炮灰。",
	"Occasionally a paeliryon becomes more powerful than their sisters and takes on the mantle of a sire of corruption. These sires can be counted among the strongest infernals, aside from archdevils, and usually direct their power to other planes of existence. Befitting their name, sires of corruption only seek one goal: to corrupt. To this end, their plans often involve the decay of empires or corruption of religious groups. Sires are few and far between, and a new sire usually rises only once every few centuries. Though they usually operate alone, some sires have served archdevils whose plans involved enough corruption to encourage cooperation.": "偶尔，一个(paeliryon)比她的姐妹更强大，并承担了腐化之父的职责。这些腐化之父可以算得上是最强大的地狱生物之一，除了(archdevils)之外，通常会将他们的力量指向其他存在的位面。与其名字相符，腐化之父只追求一个目标：腐化。为此，他们的计划通常涉及帝国的衰落或宗教团体的腐化。腐化之父数量稀少，通常每隔几个世纪才会出现一个新的腐化之父。虽然他们通常独自行动，但有些腐化之父曾为(archdevils)效力，后者的计划涉及足够的腐化以鼓励合作。",
	"Despite frequent shifts in leadership among other archdevils, Dispater has maintained his position as the ruler of Dis since its creation. Known for his vigilance and caution, he rarely leaves his tower, and even less frequently leaves the Iron City. Those who know his plans, including Asmodeus, know that he hopes to one day rule each layer of the Nine Hells.": "尽管其他大恶魔领袖经常更迭，但自从创立以来，迪斯帕特尔一直保持着对迪斯的统治地位。以其警惕和谨慎而闻名，他很少离开自己的塔楼，更少去铁城。了解他计划的人，包括阿斯莫德斯，都知道他希望有朝一日统治九层地狱的每一层。",
	"Dispater remains one of the foremost suppliers of weapons across all the planes, which helps keep his position in Dis secure. As well, his advisors are carefully chosen and he maintains very few friendships.": "迪斯帕特尔（Dispater）仍然是跨越所有位面的主要武器供应商之一，这有助于他在迪斯（Dis）保持地位。此外，他的顾问们都经过精心挑选，他保持着很少的友谊。",
	"Those that attempt battle with the Iron Lord find victory nigh impossible. In addition to his stratagem and defense, Dispater maintains extremely powerful abilities and a legion of minions. Outwitting him can't be done, and anyone unfortunate enough to catch him off guard is quickly disposed of.": "那些试图与铁领主交战的人发现取得胜利几乎是不可能的。除了他的谋略和防御之外，（Dispater）（迪斯帕特）还拥有极其强大的能力和一支军团的手下。战胜他是不可能的，任何不幸让他措手不及的人都会很快被处置。",
	"Dispater remains calm and controlled in conversation. He prefers wherever possible to engage in gentlemanly debates rather than aggressive arguments. Unlike other archdevils, he almost never forces an individual into doing something, preferring to persuade or deceive instead. Fittingly, his skin is an iron-black color and his signature staff, wrought from the same iron as the tower he lives in, is always in hand.": "狄斯帕特 (Dispater) 在交谈中保持冷静和控制。他更喜欢尽可能参与绅士式的辩论，而不是激烈的争论。与其他大恶魔不同的是，他几乎从不强迫个人做某事，而更喜欢说服或欺骗。他的皮肤呈铁黑色，他的标志性法杖，由他居住的塔楼同样的铁锻造而成，总是在手中。",
	"The ruler of Dis makes his lair inside the Iron Tower. Within these confines he is vastly more protected.": "地狱之王在铁塔内建立了他的巢穴。在这个地方，他得到了更强大的保护。",
	"Long ago a Fey lord led his hunt into the Nine Hells to settle a score with an archfiend over mortals claimed by both. What fate the lord met is unknown, but of all his expedition, one particular faerie breed prospered in its new environment. A particularly vicious strain of displacer beast has become an entrenched new threat across many layers of the Nine Hells, prowling about the edges of fiendish communities and attacking mortal and infernal travelers alike.": "很久以前，一个精灵领主带领他的狩猎队进入了九层地狱，为了与一位大恶魔解决对共同索取的凡人的纠纷。这位领主遇到了什么命运至今无人得知，但在他的远征中，有一种特殊的仙灵品种在新环境中繁荣起来。一种特别凶残的位移兽品系已经成为九层地狱许多层次中根深蒂固的新威胁，潜伏在邪恶社区的边缘，袭击凡人和地狱旅行者。",
	"Long ages in the Nine Hells have warped the original beasts into something more fiendish. Whilst still feline in shape, the displacer fiend's shoulders sprout with an explosion of writhing tentacles each tipped with a lamprey-like mouth. These tooth-lined maws drain life essence or infernal strength from their prey, providing the fiends with their sustenance. The mouths drip with a vitriol that causes agony to mortals, but acts as a tranquilizing balm to devils, permitting the Fiends to feast on them without waking their prey if they get the chance. Displacer fiends retain the innate stealth of their progenitors and slip from shadow to shadow across all but the most barren of infernal landscapes. Packs of them will follow travelers for long distances, waiting until the terrain most favors an ambush.": "在九层地狱中度过漫长岁月的原始野兽已经扭曲成了更邪恶的存在。虽然形态仍然是猫科动物，位移恶魔的肩膀上长出了一片扭动的触手，每根触手尖端都长有像七鳃鳗一样的嘴。这些长满牙齿的口器从猎物身上吸取生命精华或地狱力量，为恶魔们提供养分。这些嘴滴着一种能够给凡人带来痛苦的腐蚀性液体，但对恶魔却起到镇定作用，让恶魔们能够在不惊醒猎物的情况下享用它们。位移恶魔保留了它们祖先固有的潜行能力，在除了最贫瘠的地狱景观之外的阴影中穿行。它们会成群结队地跟随旅行者长途跋涉，等待地形最有利于伏击的时机。",
	"Like their base stock, displacer fiends bend light around themselves, the visible monster always slightly shifted from its true location. These natural gifts have been fortified by the deceptive influence of the lower planes. The monsters also possess the ability to shift the perceived location of their victim and affect their prey's grasp of relative distance and place. Fighting them can be a nightmare of confusion, as allies, enemies and landscape features appear randomly close or far, huge or small—or the fighters find themselves viewing the battlefield from outside their own heads, trying to control their bodies like puppets. Even basic functions like proprioception—the knowledge of where one's limbs are when not directly observed—can be lost. This can lead to a complete loss of coordination, accidentally striking friends or falling into bogs or crevasses that seemed far distant.": "与它们的基础种族一样，位移恶魔会将光线弯曲在自己周围，使得这种可见的怪物总是略微偏离其真实位置。这些天赋天生的能力已经被下位位面的欺骗性影响所加强。这些怪物还拥有改变受害者感知位置、影响猎物对相对距离和位置的把握的能力。与它们战斗可能会变成一场混乱的噩梦，因为盟友、敌人和地形特征似乎会随机地接近或远离，变得巨大或微小——或者战士们发现自己从自己的头脑之外观看战场，试图像操纵木偶一样控制自己的身体。甚至像本体感知这样的基本功能——即当没有直接观察时知道自己的四肢在哪里——都可能会丧失。这可能导致完全失去协调，意外地击中朋友或跌入看似遥远的沼泽或裂缝中。",
	"Many large cities in the Nine Hells have feral populations of displacer fiends predating off the lowliest devils and breeding in hidden corners. Much of the time they're considered pests, but they do keep down populations of various infernal vermin, like halogs, that would otherwise be more troubling in their proliferation. Some devils actively cultivate their presence, encouraging them by staking out a lemure or imp every so often, as a human might leave a bowl of scraps for a cat. Devils aren't sentimental, but some find the viciousness and skulking cruelty of the displacer fiends oddly endearing.": "在九层地狱的许多大城市中，有着野生的位移恶魔群体，以最卑微的恶魔为食，并在隐秘角落繁殖。大部分时间它们被视为害虫，但它们确实控制了各种地狱害虫的数量，比如哈洛格，否则它们的繁殖将更加麻烦。一些恶魔会积极培育它们的存在，定期放置一个涂魔或小恶魔，就像人类会留一碗残羹剩饭给猫一样。恶魔并不多愁善感，但有些人发现位移恶魔的凶残和潜行残忍反而让人感到怪异地可爱。",
	"Fierna rules Phlegethos alongside her father, Belial. She is emotionally intelligent, and her charisma has earned her many allies and few enemies in the Nine Hells. Although some view her as incompetent, Fierna's true intentions are hidden behind a smokescreen of brashness.": "费尔娜（Fierna）与她的父亲贝利亚（Belial）一起统治弗勒戈索斯（Phlegethos）。她情商高，魅力赢得了许多盟友，在九层地狱中敌人寥寥。尽管有些人认为她无能，但费尔娜的真正意图被一层大胆的烟幕掩盖着。",
	"Her father, Belial, was a key player in the Reckoning, and due to his actions, Fierna was granted primary leadership of Phlegethos. Despite this political appearance, Fierna and Belial rule together, often meeting in secret to discuss strategy and upcoming plans. Some of the more ignorant archdevils view the relationship between Belial and Fierna as something to be exploited or broken. In reality, Fierna deeply respects her father, and the feeling is mutual.": "她的父亲，贝利亚(Belial)，是审判中的关键人物，由于他的行动，菲尔娜(Fierna)被授予了菲莱戈斯(Phlegethos)的主要领导权。尽管在政治上如此，菲尔娜和贝利亚经常一起统治，经常秘密会面讨论战略和即将到来的计划。一些更无知的大恶魔认为贝利亚和菲尔娜之间的关系是可以利用或破坏的。实际上，菲尔娜深深尊重她的父亲，这种感情是相互的。",
	"Laying eyes on Fierna, one can immediately see the reasons she is so admired: she is impossibly beautiful. Her beauty is a strength, complementing her strategic mind and ingenuity.": "看到费尔娜，人们立刻就能看出她备受钦佩的原因：她美得令人难以置信。她的美丽是一种力量，与她的战略头脑和创造力相辅相成。",
	"Fierna's lair is a palace, a tower of crystalline stone wreathed in blue flame.": "菲恩娜的巢穴是一座宫殿，一座被蓝色火焰缭绕的水晶石塔。",
	"Glasya is known by many names: the Dark Prodigy, the Princess of the Nine Hells, and Lord of Malbolge. She maintains control over the erinyes and has a massive following within the downtrodden and the neglected royalty of the other planes. For a long time, she was simply a lesser archdevil, jumping between various courts as she saw fit. It wasn't until the Reckoning, which she helped instigate, that she claimed true power and became ruler of one of the nine layers.": "格拉西亚（Glasya）以许多名字闻名：黑暗神童（the Dark Prodigy）、九层地狱的公主（the Princess of the Nine Hells）和马尔波尔吉之主（Lord of Malbolge）。她控制着厄里尼斯（erinyes），在其他位面的受压迫者和被忽视的王室中拥有庞大的追随者。很长一段时间以来，她只是一个次要的大恶魔，在各种宫廷之间随心所欲地跳跃。直到她帮助发动的“清算”（the Reckoning），她才声称真正的权力，并成为九层地狱之一的统治者。",
	"Asmodeus, her father, and Glasya share much in common—particularly their cunning, ambition, and \"dedication\" to laws. Because of this, despite some of the hatred Glasya has towards her father, the two share a relationship of respect and support.": "阿斯莫德斯，她的父亲，和格拉西亚有许多共同点—特别是他们的狡诈、野心和对法律的“奉献”。正因为如此，尽管格拉西亚对她的父亲有些憎恨，但两人之间有着相互尊重和支持的关系。",
	"Even though she busies herself with many important undertakings to further cement her power, being surrounded by beautiful things is also important to Glasya. Similarly, she detests the ugly, punishing those she sees as disgusting. During her brief relationship with Mammon, she was rarely found in his swampy domain, choosing instead to roam other layers. Almost everything that interacts with Glasya either deeply loves or loathes her. She maintains a charming persona, often even converting spies from other archdevils to her side.": "即使她忙于许多重要事务以进一步巩固自己的权力，但被美丽的事物环绕也对格拉西亚很重要。同样地，她厌恶丑陋，惩罚那些她认为令人恶心的人。在与玛蒙的短暂关系中，她很少出现在他那沼泽般的领域，而选择漫游其他层次。与格拉西亚互动的几乎所有事物要么深深地爱她，要么憎恨她。她保持着迷人的人设，甚至经常将其他大恶魔的间谍转变为自己的一方。",
	"Perhaps contributing to her obsession with beauty, Glasya herself is considered stunning. Her jet-black hair and copper skin hide her infernal nature, though her large, leathery wings and small horns give it away. Due to her ability to polymorph at will, she can meet various other standards of beauty as well, always maintaining an outward charm—which helps conceal her foul core.": "或许是由于对美的执着，格拉西亚本人也被认为是令人惊艳的。她那乌黑的头发和铜色的皮肤掩盖了她的地狱本质，尽管她那又大又皱的翅膀和小角暴露了她的真实身份。由于她可以随意变形的能力，她还可以满足其他各种美的标准，始终保持外表的魅力——这有助于掩盖她那邪恶的内核。",
	"Glasya built her fortress lair, Ossiea, from the grotesquely enlarged and distorted skull of Malagard. Behind the walls of the skull, there are numerous opulent levels, within which Glasya conducts the business of ruling her realm or indulges her other interests.": "格拉西娅（Glasya）在本地区习惯的基础上，用畸形巨大的马拉加德（Malagard）头骨建造了她的堡垒巢穴奥西亚（Ossiea）。在头骨墙壁后面，有许多豪华的层次，格拉西娅在其中处理她统治领域的事务或追求其他兴趣。",
	"A greater tyrant shadow's lair is always within a few miles of the devil that spawned it, which means that the tyrant shadow itself may often relocate, following the movements of its progenitor, even across the layers of the Nine Hells themselves. Of the lair specifically, the tyrant shadow generally selects a suitably cavernous locale, with deep shadows, perfect for skulking and ambushes. Eroded canyons, abandoned dwellings, and even deep forests, though rare in the Nine Hells, are also suitable locations.": "一个更大的暴君之影的巢穴总是在离它所产生的恶魔几英里之内，这意味着暴君之影本身经常会搬迁，跟随其祖先的活动，甚至穿越九层地狱的层次。关于巢穴，暴君之影通常会选择一个适合的洞穴地点，有深深的阴影，非常适合潜伏和伏击。被侵蚀的峡谷，废弃的住所，甚至深邃的森林，虽然在九层地狱中很少见，也是合适的地点。",
	"There are few places more inhospitable than the Nine Hells, yet denizens from other places make a home even here. Not only the evil whose philosophy aligns with the devils, but simple creatures whose endurance and appetites permit them to survive the infernal realms. Often this means huge monsters strong enough to fight the native denizens, but some intruders pose a different kind of problem to the devils. Halogs seem small and weak compared to almost everything in the Nine Hells, yet they're becoming a serious nuisance across all the lower planes.": "没有比九层地狱更不适宜的地方了，然而其他地方的居民甚至在这里找到了家园。不仅是那些与恶魔哲学一致的邪恶存在，还有那些耐力和食欲使它们能够在地狱领域生存的简单生物。通常这意味着足够强大以与本地居民对抗的巨大怪物，但一些入侵者对恶魔构成了不同类型的问题。哈洛格（Halog）与九层地狱中的几乎所有生物相比显得又小又弱，然而它们正在成为所有下层位面的严重麻烦。",
	"Halogs are around the size of a dog, and somewhere between a rat and a dog in appearance. Individually they're unprepossessing, often bearing burns, festering pustules, scars and other marks of a harsh environment that never seems able to quite kill them. They breed with formidable speed. Pairs of halogs raise litters of twenty which can mature in just a handful of days if sufficient food is on hand. And halogs eat anything. Their digestive juices alter in composition to permit them to devour infernal flesh as easily as that of mortal creatures, along with any kind of plant matter and even minerals. Only regions that are nothing but barren rock and dust offer nothing to them.": "哈洛格(Halogs)的大小与狗相当，外观介于老鼠和狗之间。它们个体看起来不起眼，经常带着烧伤、化脓性脓疱、疤痕和其他恶劣环境的痕迹，这种环境似乎永远无法完全杀死它们。它们繁殖速度惊人。一对哈洛格可以养育二十只幼崽，只要有足够的食物，这些幼崽就可以在几天内成熟。哈洛格吃任何东西。它们的消化液成分会改变，使它们能够像吞食凡间生物一样轻松地吞食地狱生物的肉，以及任何植物物质甚至矿物质。只有那些充满贫瘠岩石和尘土的地区对它们毫无吸引力。",
	"Individually, halogs are weak, but as a species they're fearsomely hardy. Halogs seldom thrive in regions not requiring their unique adaptability, because of greater competition from other creatures. The hostile conditions of the lower planes mean that regular vermin and predators are lacking, leaving them their niche. The secret of the halogs' success is that the harsher their environment, the more they prosper. Whether heat, cold, acid, poison, or even pure necrotic energy—if it doesn't kill them outright then they swiftly adapt to feed off it. Halogs live among the flames of Phlegethos, the icy wastes of Stygia and the swamps of Minauros equally, and no devil city is free of their swarming presence no matter how the Fiends try to exterminate them. They even swim rat-like in the waters of the Styx. The vermin have a powerful defense mechanism. Their saliva and blood adapts swiftly in response to the vulnerabilities of their antagonists so that their bites inflict the worst harm, and anything trying to eat their flesh suffers for it. The remarkable upshot of this is that the halogs of the Nine Hells most often have teeth blazing with radiant divine energy, enough to make short work of unwary minor devils.": "作为个体，哈洛格(halogs)很弱，但作为一个物种，它们异常强健。哈洛格很少能在不需要它们独特适应能力的地区茁壮成长，因为会受到其他生物更大的竞争。下层位面的恶劣条件意味着常规的害虫和捕食者缺乏，为它们留下了生存的空间。哈洛格成功的秘诀在于，环境越恶劣，它们就越繁荣。无论是炎热、寒冷、酸性、毒素，甚至纯粹的死灵能量——只要没有将它们彻底杀死，它们就会迅速适应并从中获益。哈洛格同样生活在菲莱戈斯(Phlegethos)的火焰中、斯提吉亚(Stygia)的冰冷荒野和米诺洛斯(Minauros)的沼泽地中，无论邪恶者如何试图消灭它们，恶魔城市都无法摆脱它们蜂拥而至的存在。它们甚至像老鼠一样在斯提克斯(Styx)的水中游动。这些害虫有强大的防御机制。它们的唾液和血液会迅速适应对手的弱点，使它们的咬伤造成最严重的伤害，任何试图吃它们肉体的生物都会为此付出代价。这一显著结果是，九层地狱中的哈洛格往往有着充满光辉神圣能量的牙齿，足以迅速击败不留神的次级恶魔。",
	"Despite their remarkable abilities and most common habitats, halogs are basically just animals. They're smart, but in the same way as a bright dog or a monkey. Druids, rangers, and other guardians of nature luckless enough to find themselves in the Nine Hells have been able to forge bonds with the creatures, and even muster them as impromptu scouts and sentries when travelling in the lower planes.": "尽管halogs拥有出色的能力和最常见的栖息地，但它们基本上只是动物。它们聪明，但与聪明的狗或猴子类似。德鲁伊、游侠和其他自然守护者不幸地发现自己身处九层地狱时，曾经能够与这些生物建立联系，甚至在前往下层位面时将它们召集为临时侦察兵和哨兵。",
	"Possessing a unique ability to detect both the alignment and strength of an individual telepathically, bezekiras, otherwise known as hellcats, search for the most powerful master of lawful evil alignment. Once they've found a master, they're extremely loyal and follow all commands, until a stronger master comes along. When not serving a master, hellcats are fiercely independent, secretive, and intelligent.": "拥有独特的能力，可以在心灵感应中探测个体的阵营和力量，贝泽基拉斯（bezekiras），又被称为地狱猫，寻找最强大的守序邪恶阵营的主人。一旦它们找到主人，它们会非常忠诚，遵循所有命令，直到有更强大的主人出现。当没有为主人服务时，地狱猫是非常独立、神秘和聪明的。",
	"When visible, hellcats take on the appearance of larger cats, including lions and tigers. However, they have an innate invisibility when in any source of light, preventing their corporeal form from appearing anywhere outside of total darkness. They appear wraith-like, with the wispy outline of their body composed of ethereal light and devilish fire. Though they rarely hunt creatures of evil alignment, good creatures are slaughtered on sight, sometimes even against their master's orders. Bezekiras propagate through natural means, though petitioners and devils are sometimes given their form.": "当可见时，地狱猫会呈现出更大的猫类动物的外观，包括狮子和老虎。然而，在任何光源中，它们具有固有的隐形能力，阻止它们的实体形态出现在完全黑暗之外的任何地方。它们看起来像幽灵，身体的轮廓由以太光和恶魔火组成。虽然它们很少猎杀邪恶阵营的生物，但对于善良的生物，它们会立即被屠杀，有时甚至违背它们主人的命令。贝泽基拉通过自然方式繁殖，尽管有时会赋予请愿者和恶魔它们的形态。",
	"It was Jenevere's role to watch the mortal planes for individuals of particular virtue. Forbidden to intervene, she would record their struggles and deeds, to be brought in evidence when their souls migrated to their final reward. After centuries of meek observation, she petitioned for more active divine involvement in the fates of those she watched. She was refused. It was too much for her. Against the strictures of her role, she visited the mortal realms to interfere. No grand drawing of flaming swords, just calm words, a timely reminder of morality at the fulcrum point of someone's moral struggle. In time, the Nine Hells became aware of her influence and set a trap for her. After her capture she passed through various hands. Jenevere isn't fierce and combative, but open, honest, and infinitely merciful. She forgives the Fiends that torment her, knowing it is their nature, and her forgiveness burns them more than they can burn her. Possession of Jenevere became something of a poisoned chalice, so that she fell through their hierarchy, possessed by meaner and meaner masters, until she was acquired by Vaness and Fling of the Eye Market.": "珍妮维尔（Jenevere）的角色是在凡间观察具有特殊美德的个体。她被禁止干预，只能记录他们的挣扎和行为，以便在他们的灵魂迁移到最终奖赏时作为证据呈现。经过几个世纪的默默观察后，她请求更积极地神圣介入她所观察对象的命运。但她被拒绝了。这对她来说太过分了。违背她角色的限制，她访问了凡间，进行干预。没有华丽的火剑，只是平静的言辞，及时提醒某人在道德挣扎的关键点上。随着时间的推移，九层地狱意识到了她的影响，并为她设下了陷阱。在被捕后，她经历了各种折磨。珍妮维尔并不凶猛好斗，而是开放、诚实和无限慈悲。她宽恕那些折磨她的恶魔，知道这是他们的本性，而她的宽恕比他们对她的伤害更深。拥有珍妮维尔成为一种有毒的圣杯，因此她在他们的等级制度中跌落，被越来越卑劣的主人所拥有，直到被凡尼斯（Vaness）和弗林（Fling）从眼市（Eye Market）中获得。",
	"Jenevere's eyes are remarkable things, fashioned by gods to see all the virtues of the mortal realms. Vaness and Fling removed her eyes easily enough, but implanting them into a Fiend, or any of the evil things that come cap in hand to them, proved problematic. The eyes are a gateway to all the virtue and goodness of the planes. To Vaness and Fling's patrons, the experience proved unendurable. Vaness and Fling continue to experiment, but they're beginning to feel that in acquiring Jenevere they've taken on more than they can handle.": "珍妮维尔（Jenevere）的眼睛是非凡之物，由众神打造，可以看到凡间所有的美德。范尼斯（Vaness）和弗林（Fling）很容易地取走了她的眼睛，但将其植入恶魔，或者任何向他们伸手的邪恶生物身上，却证明是个问题。这些眼睛是通往各个位面的美德和善良的门户。对于范尼斯和弗林的赞助者来说，这种经历是无法忍受的。范尼斯和弗林继续实验，但他们开始感觉，通过获取珍妮维尔，他们承担了更多他们无法控制的东西。",
	"Koh Tam is the powerful head priest of Kelemvor, god of death and the dead, at the Waterdeep cathedral. Seeking to know all the secrets of the realms of the dead, Koh Tam petitioned his god for permission to explore the Nine Hells. The young priest set forth into the infernal realm where he bore witness to horrors beyond mortal imagination and encountered fiendish creatures whose power greatly outmatched his own. The experience forever changed the priest. Rather than sate his curiosity, the journey only served to further incite Koh Tam's fascination with the infernal. He devoted himself to the study of arcane books concerning the subject and collected an impressive number of infernal relics.": "柯坦(Koh Tam)是位强大的祭司，他是死亡与亡者之神凯尔姆沃(Kelemvor)在水深大教堂的首领。为了探寻亡者领域的所有秘密，柯坦请求他的神允许他探索九层地狱。这位年轻的祭司踏上了通往地狱的征途，在那里他目睹了超出凡人想象的恐怖，并遭遇了比自己强大得多的恶魔生物。这段经历永远改变了这位祭司。旅程并没有满足他的好奇心，反而进一步激发了柯坦对地狱的迷恋。他全身心地投入到研究有关这个主题的奥秘书籍中，并收集了大量地狱遗物。",
	"In the many years since, the head priest has made several expeditions into the Nine Hells and has had many more encounters with fearsome devils. Koh Tam can thus be considered the expert authority on the infernal realm. He has advised many adventurers who seek to venture into the Nine Hells and has also prevented a fair number of foul creatures from fleeing that realm into mortal worlds. Though he remains devoted to the laws of Kelemvor, so much exposure to the infernal has changed Koh Tam in mind and body. The head priest has many habits and mannerisms that might seem strange to other mortals, and he has a unique perspective colored by his experience with the Nine Hells.": "多年来，首席祭司进行了多次探险进入九层地狱，并与许多可怕的恶魔有过多次交锋。因此，可谭可以被视为地狱领域的专家权威。他已经为许多寻求冒险进入九层地狱的冒险者提供建议，并阻止了不少邪恶生物逃离那个领域进入凡间世界。尽管他仍然忠于凯尔姆沃的法则，但对地狱的暴露已经改变了可谭的思想和身体。首席祭司有许多习惯和举止对其他凡人来说可能看起来很奇怪，他的独特观点也受到了他与九层地狱的经历所影响。",
	"No archdevil is more hated than the Frozen Prince, Levistus, despite his reputation as an honorable and chivalrous archdevil. Rivaling Asmodeus and Dis in their ability to plan and strategize, Levistus is generally considered one of the most plausible archdevils for overthrowing the throne. His ambition was somewhat stifled when he committed an unspeakable betrayal and was imprisoned by Asmodeus deep within the ice of Stygia.": "没有比冰封王子莱维斯塔斯更受憎恨的大恶魔，尽管他以光荣和骑士精神的大恶魔而闻名。在计划和策略方面与阿斯莫迪斯和迪斯相媲美，莱维斯塔斯通常被认为是最有可能推翻王座的大恶魔之一。当他犯下一次无法启齿的背叛并被阿斯莫迪斯囚禁在斯提吉亚的冰中时，他的野心有些受到了阻碍。",
	"Even while imprisoned, Levistus continues to plot, choosing to force his rage inward and reflect. Divination and communication magic helps aid this effort, and even from within his icy tomb Levistus manages legions. Levistus is known to make many deals with adventurers, provided they can aid his search for freedom.": "即使被囚禁，(Levistus) 仍然继续策划，选择将他的愤怒内化并反思。占卜和交流魔法有助于这一努力，即使在他的冰冷之墓中，(Levistus) 也能管理军团。众所周知，(Levistus) 与冒险者达成许多交易，只要他们能帮助他寻找自由。",
	"When the Reckoning happened. Asmodeus, noticing that Levistus played no part in the war, chose to reinstate him as ruler of Stygia. While Levistus still desired revenge on his jailor, he recognized the opportunity and pledged temporary allegiance to Asmodeus. Publicly, Levistus completely supports Asmodeus and his plans, though from beneath the ice he continues to plot his revenge.": "当清算发生时，阿斯莫德斯(Asmodeus)注意到莱维斯塔斯(Levistus)在战争中没有参与，选择让他恢复为斯提基亚(Stygia)的统治者。尽管莱维斯塔斯仍然渴望报复他的囚禁者，但他意识到了这个机会，并承诺临时效忠于阿斯莫德斯。公开场合下，莱维斯塔斯完全支持阿斯莫德斯及其计划，尽管在冰下，他仍在策划他的报复。",
	"Other archdevils describe Levistus as clever, charming, and observant, if not also traitorous. He was often known to engage adversaries in single combat, only calling upon his magic and followers if someone or something intervened. For this reason, he is often worshipped by honorable thieves and charlatans—rogues with a code.": "其他大恶魔描述利维斯塔斯(Levistus)聪明、迷人、观察力敏锐，但也可能是背叛者。他经常以单挑的方式与对手交战，只有在有人或某物干涉时才会动用他的魔法和追随者。因此，他经常受到正派盗贼和江湖骗子的崇拜——这些有着自己准则的流氓。",
	"Levistus is described as an attractive humanoid male, with dark hair, an impeccable goatee, and pale-white skin.": "Levistus（莱维斯塔斯）被描述为一个英俊的人形男性，拥有黑色头发、一把无可挑剔的山羊胡子和苍白的皮肤。",
	"The ruler of Stygia's lair is within his floating prison. This great glacier moves ponderously over the ages, carrying with it Levistus, and the effects of his lair.": "斯提吉亚之主的巢穴就在他的漂浮监狱之中。这座巨大的冰川在漫长岁月中缓慢移动，带着莱维斯塔斯和他巢穴的影响。",
	"Created with the sole purpose of protection, maelephants are the most loyal of the devils. They eschew personal possessions, dreams, and goals, and find happiness in the completion of their duty. While other devils may view them as simple and unintelligent, many recognize the importance and utility of maelephants. Infernal and common are often spoken languages, but maelephants also maintain their own unique language, which they use exclusively in communication with others of their kind.": "创造出来的唯一目的是保护，魔象是最忠诚的恶魔。他们摒弃个人财产、梦想和目标，从完成自己的职责中找到幸福。虽然其他恶魔可能认为他们简单和愚蠢，但许多人都认识到魔象的重要性和实用性。地狱语和普通语经常被使用，但魔象也保留着自己独特的语言，他们只在与同类交流时使用。",
	"As their name would suggest, maelephants share many physical features with elephants. They stand on two legs, but have an elephant-like head and legs. Their trunk usually ends in a sharp spike, and their hands and feet are both clawed. When threatened, maelephants emit a cloud of toxins that cause brain damage and memory loss.": "正如它们的名字所暗示的那样，麦象（maelephants）与大象有许多相似的身体特征。它们站立在两条腿上，但有着大象般的头部和腿部。它们的象鼻通常以尖锐的尖端结束，手和脚都有爪子。当受到威胁时，麦象会释放出一团毒素云，导致大脑损伤和记忆丧失。",
	"Despite them being lower-ranked devils, their position as trustworthy guardians makes other lower devils respect maelephants. When not under active duty or protecting something, a maelephant might aimlessly wander the layers searching for a new charge. Some of these nomads wander many years before finally ending their search.": "尽管它们是地位较低的恶魔，但它们作为值得信赖的守护者的地位使其他较低级的恶魔尊重马象（maelephants）。当没有在执行任务或保护某物时，一只马象可能会漫无目的地在各个层面徘徊，寻找新的任务。一些这样的游牧者可能在多年后才最终结束他们的寻找。",
	"Perhaps the richest being in all the realms, there is nothing that Mammon loves more than wealth. Where other devils obsess over souls and power, Mammon is perfectly content to continually increase his material possessions. Interestingly, he is one of the only archdevils willing to make deals with mortals over strictly monetary terms. Whether he maintains his end of the deal, however, is a completely different story. Anyone that interacts with Mammon immediately recognizes his two-faced approach—the devil will say or do anything, if he thinks it will benefit him in the end.": "或许是所有领域中最富有的存在，没有什么比财富更让魔王玛蒙（Mammon）更加痴迷。其他恶魔可能会着迷于灵魂和权力，但玛蒙却完全满足于不断增加他的物质财富。有趣的是，他是少数愿意与凡人就纯粹金钱条件达成交易的大恶魔之一。然而，他是否遵守交易的条款则是另一回事。任何与玛蒙打交道的人都会立刻认识到他的两面性——如果他认为这样做对他有利，这位恶魔会说或做任何事情。",
	"Aside from hunting for coin, Mammon also enjoys hunting for sport. If anger strikes him (and it does so often), he will frequently summon up a steed and hounds to partake in a trophy hunt.": "除了追逐金币，(Mammon) 还喜欢进行运动狩猎。如果愤怒袭来（这经常发生），他经常会召唤出一匹骏马和猎犬，参加一场狩猎比赛。",
	"Anything he has designated as prey rarely escapes his fervor, though he quickly grows bored once his quarry is caught.": "他所指定的猎物很少能逃脱他的热情，尽管一旦捕获到猎物，他很快就会感到厌倦。",
	"Scheming and betrayal are like breathing for Mammon, and conversely so is bootlicking. Some argue that his punishment after the Reckoning was severely reduced due to his shameless groveling before Asmodeus. In fact, he was the first of all archdevils to surrender during the coup, even selling out some of his co-conspirators.": "对于魔王（Mammon）来说，阴谋和背叛就像呼吸一样，相反的是拍马屁也是如此。有人认为，在清算之后，他的惩罚之所以被严重减轻，是因为他在阿斯莫德斯（Asmodeus）面前卑躬屈膝。事实上，在政变期间，他是所有大恶魔中第一个投降的，甚至出卖了一些同谋。",
	"Despite all his faults, one thing Mammon has mastered is the soul trade. Even Asmodeus recognizes that no archdevil can manage and distribute souls as well as Mammon. Perhaps his expertise comes from the massive profit that can be made from managing souls, or perhaps he wanted to find somewhere to belong—nobody knows for sure.": "尽管他有种种缺点，但魔王玛蒙（Mammon）掌握的一项技能是灵魂交易。即使阿斯莫德斯（Asmodeus）也承认，没有哪位大恶魔能像玛蒙那样出色地管理和分配灵魂。也许他的专业知识来自于管理灵魂所能带来的巨大利润，或者也许他想找到一个归属之处——没有人确切知道。",
	"Mammon's lair is in a tomb-like palace, within Minauros, and like most structures in the city is in a perpetual state of sinking into the swamp.": "玛门的巢穴位于米诺洛斯(Minauros)内的一个类似墓室的宫殿中，和城市中的大多数建筑一样，它也在不断地沉入沼泽之中。",

	"An ancient entity, rivaling Asmodeus in age, Mephistopheles has been responsible for many schemes to try and unseat the Lord of the Nine Hells. One of his most infamous was an alliance between himself, Dispater, Mammon, and Geryon. They conspired to take power from the other archdevils, Baalzebul, Zariel, Belial, and Moloch. With this increased power, Mephistopheles believed he could challenge Asmodeus himself. But he was betrayed by Geryon, who had secretly sided with Asmodeus. Despite the blatancy of his rebellion, Mephistopheles was the archdevil that suffered the least: not cursed like Mammon or Baalzebul; not cast down like Belial, Moloch or Geryon. This has led many to believe that there is some ancient secret to the relationship between Asmodeus and Mephistopheles, though what it could be is a mystery none have discovered.": "在年龄上与阿斯莫德乌斯相媲美的古老存在，梅菲斯托菲勒斯一直负责许多阴谋，试图取代九层地狱之主。他最臭名昭著的一个阴谋是与迪斯帕特、玛蒙和盖里昂结盟。他们密谋夺取其他大恶魔巴尔塞布、扎瑞艾尔、贝利亚尔和摩洛克的权力。梅菲斯托菲勒斯相信，凭借这种增加的力量，他可以挑战阿斯莫德乌斯本人。但他被盖里昂背叛了，后者秘密地站在了阿斯莫德乌斯一边。尽管他的叛乱是如此公然，梅菲斯托菲勒斯是受害最轻的大恶魔：不像玛蒙或巴尔塞布那样被诅咒；也没有像贝利亚尔、摩洛克或盖里昂那样被打倒。这让许多人相信，阿斯莫德乌斯和梅菲斯托菲勒斯之间存在着一些古老的秘密关系，尽管这个秘密是什么，至今没有人发现。",
	"As the foremost spellcaster of the Nine Hells, Mephistopheles often resorts to magic when forced to defend himself. But his greatest power comes from the ability to wield Hellfire itself. Created by tapping into the profane essence of the Nine Hells, Hellfire is unimaginably, unbearably hot. Mephistopheles can also shape Hellfire however he wishes, making it his most potent weapon.": "作为九层地狱中最杰出的法术施展者，梅菲斯托费勒斯在被迫自卫时常常借助魔法。但他最强大的力量来自于能够驾驭地狱之火的能力。通过利用九层地狱的亵渎本质创造出来，地狱之火无法想象地炽热难耐。梅菲斯托费勒斯还可以随心所欲地塑造地狱之火，使其成为他最强大的武器。",
	"This archdevil's lair is the Citadel of Mephistar, located within the glacier of Nargus. This an elegantly carved ice palace and is home to Mephistopheles' private manor, along with living accommodations for numerous other devils.": "这位大恶魔的巢穴是梅菲斯塔城堡，位于纳古斯冰川之中。这是一个优雅雕刻的冰宫，是梅菲斯托菲勒斯的私人庄园，同时也为许多其他恶魔提供了居住设施。",
	"Avernus is a bleak wasteland of jagged mountains and metal-studded hills, but the true ugliness to a devil's eyes is in the scars of war where demonic corpses, arms, and armor pile, infecting the plane with their chaotic ichor and breeding fresh monsters to trouble the order of the Nine Hells. The miasmorne were bred to clean up after Abyssal invasion: great lumbering Monstrosities able to devour demonic flesh, armor, weapons, and ruined war engines and return the plane to its pristine starkness. The monsters prospered beyond anyone's reckoning and now drag their bellies across many layers of the Nine Hells.": "阿弗纳斯（Avernus）是一片充满尖峰山脉和铁钉覆盖的山丘的荒凉荒原，但对于恶魔的眼睛来说，真正的丑陋在于战争的伤疤，那里堆积着恶魔的尸体、武器和盔甲，感染着这片平原，滋生出新的怪物来扰乱九层地狱的秩序。混沌凝血体（miasmorne）被培育出来清理深渊入侵后的残局：它们是巨大笨重的畸形生物，能够吞食恶魔的血肉、盔甲、武器和毁坏的战争机器，将这片平原恢复到原始的荒凉状态。这些怪物超出了任何人的预料，现在它们拖着肚子穿越九层地狱的许多层。",
	"Miasmorne resemble bulky, wingless dragons, their broad heads flanked with great fans that they spread when challenged. While they will gorge themselves on dead flesh—or create fresh corpses with their impressive teeth and jaws—their preferred meal is mineral. Where their populations have grown, they seek out concentrations of metal. Iron and steel are their staple fare, but they will take gold, silver, adamantine or mithril if available. As infernal cities and fortresses are often constructed of iron this leads to literal holes in the Fiends' security.": "瘴龙(Miasmorne)看起来像是笨重的、没有翅膀的龙，它们宽大的头部两侧有着巨大的扇状物，在受到挑战时会展开。虽然它们会贪婪地吞食死肉，或者用强大的牙齿和颚部制造新的尸体，但它们更喜欢吃矿物质。在它们的种群增长的地方，它们会寻找金属的聚集地。铁和钢是它们的主食，但如果有的话，它们也会吃金、银、精金或秘银。由于地狱城市和堡垒通常是由铁建造的，这导致了恶魔们的安全出现了字面上的漏洞。",
	"As well as sustaining the monsters, the metals they devour go towards fortifying their hides, bones, and jaws. Miasmorne are formidably heavy and strong, proof against mundane blades and as resistant to heat as most denizens of the Nine Hells. Not naturally aggressive, the dull-witted brutes are hard to dissuade once they decide to feed. Miasmorne saliva corrodes metal efficiently, and they frequently pause mid-fight to slobber down the brittle flakes of whatever they've just destroyed. Under threat, their head fans bristle with thousands of extruded metal spines which they launch in a cloud of flechettes at foes, scouring the air both with sharp-edged missiles and a great spray of their rusting spittle. When injured, those that have devoured magic weapons or defenses manifest those same effects in their hide and claws, expending their internal store of swallowed arcana to drive away those who disturb their feasting.": "除了维持怪物的生存外，它们所吞噬的金属也用于加固它们的皮肤、骨骼和下颚。迷雾魔兽(Miasmorne)异常沉重而强壮，对普通刀剑具有抵抗力，对热量的抵抗力与九层地狱的大多数居民一样。它们并不天生具有攻击性，这些愚蠢的畜生一旦决定进食，就很难被阻止。迷雾魔兽的唾液能高效腐蚀金属，它们经常在战斗中停下来，舔食刚刚摧毁的脆弱碎片。受到威胁时，它们头部的扇状鳍会竖立起数千根外露的金属刺，然后向敌人发射一团刺客云，用锋利的导弹和大量的生锈唾沫横扫空中。受伤时，那些吞噬了魔法武器或防御的迷雾魔兽会在皮肤和爪子上显现出相同的效果，消耗它们内部储存的吞噬奥秘来驱赶那些打扰它们进餐的人。",
	"Miasmorne are a serious problem in some regions, chewing at the walls of castles and cities, swallowing whole armories, and tearing the armaments off the hosts of the Nine Hells. Mortal intruders who can lure the creatures with meals of enchanted or high-quality metal can even use them as siege engines to get past infernal walls. In other parts of the Nine Hells, the creatures are kept as semi-domesticated guards or waste disposal monsters. In Avernus, where they were first bred, Zariel maintains a crack corps of handlers who goad the beasts into wallowing through hosts of invading demons, chewing on Abyssal mail, and eating the prized magic blades of demon princes.": "在一些地区，(Miasmorne) 是一个严重问题，它们啃咬着城堡和城市的墙壁，吞噬整个军械库，并从九层地狱的宿主身上撕下武器。能够用附魔或高质量金属饲料诱使这些生物的凡人入侵者，甚至可以将它们用作攻城战车，以突破地狱的城墙。在九层地狱的其他地方，这些生物被驯化成半驯养的守卫或废物处理怪物。在它们首次被繁殖的阿弗努斯，(Zariel) 维护着一支精锐的驯兽师队伍，驱使这些野兽在入侵恶魔的军队中翻滚，啃咬着深渊邮件，并吞食恶魔王子们珍贵的魔法之刃。",
	"The ancestors of these Fiends were servants of the divine and Fey which devoured the nightmares of mortals, bringing restful sleep. Imported into the Nine Hells and cultivated by devils, dream eaters, as they're also known, became a powerful weapon in subtly corrupting mortal minds. They can be found grazing wherever the toxic foliage of the Nine Hells grows, often guarded by low-status devils and hell hounds. When brought to weak points between the planes, their spirits seep into the mortal world. There they browse the dreaming minds of mortals. Often, they devour the hope and wonder that might inspire people to improve their lives.": "这些(`Fiends`)的祖先曾是神圣和精灵的仆人，吞噬凡人的噩梦，带来宁静的睡眠。被引入(`Nine Hells`)并被恶魔培育，也被称为梦吞者，成为了暗中腐化凡人心灵的强大武器。它们可以在(`Nine Hells`)的有毒植被生长的地方找到，通常由低级恶魔和地狱猎犬守护。当它们被带到位面之间的薄弱点时，它们的灵魂渗入凡间。在那里，它们浏览凡人的梦境。通常，它们吞噬可能激励人们改善生活的希望和惊奇。",
	"Despite their fearsome-looking appearance, dream eaters are oddly passive for a denizen of the Nine Hells. When attacked, their first instinct is to lumber away at their sluggish pace, sending out high, mournful cries that attract every devil and infernal monster within earshot. Their angry herdsmen usually arrive in short order to see off the threat.": "尽管梦吞者看起来威猛可怕，但在九层地狱的居民中，它们却异常被动。当受到攻击时，它们的第一反应是缓慢地蹒跚而去，发出高亢、哀怨的哭声，吸引附近所有恶魔和地狱怪物。它们愤怒的牧群通常会迅速赶来，驱赶威胁。",
	"Forced to fight, dream eaters' most potent defense is a release of their stored phantasmagoria. This can affect attackers in several ways. A release of nightmares taints the way that non-devils view the world around them, transforming everything—including allies—into hideous sources of fear and threat, whilst the dream eaters themselves fade into the infernal landscape. On the other hand, a release of hope and wonder leaves mortal attackers in a dazed and euphoric state, suddenly taken by wild fancies to accomplish impossible and reckless feats that see them charging off across the hellish landscape, the fight forgotten. The same expulsion of positive dream imagery has a powerful caustic effect against infernal creatures, affecting devils much as a skunk's blast against regular predators.": "被迫战斗时，梦吞噬者最强大的防御是释放他们储存的幻觉。这会以几种方式影响攻击者。噩梦的释放会扭曲非恶魔对周围世界的看法，将一切——包括盟友——转变为可怕的恐惧和威胁源，而梦吞噬者自己则淡出地狱般的景观。另一方面，希望和奇迹的释放会让凡人攻击者陷入恍惚和欣喜的状态，突然被疯狂的幻想所吸引，以完成不可能和鲁莽的壮举，让他们冲向地狱般的景观，战斗被遗忘。同样释放积极梦境的效果对地狱生物有强大的腐蚀作用，对恶魔的影响就像臭鼬对待普通捕食者的喷射一样。",
	"Another type of devil devoted to torture, excruciarchs are also competent fighters and mercenaries. Due to their reputation as torturers of devils, they're often looked down upon by other devils, occasionally even beaten or killed, and as a result they frequently travel together. Their cruelty is known across the Nine Hells, and their revelry in pain gives them their name. Another defining feature of pain devils is their greed: they serve no particular master, their loyalty must be purchased.": "另一种专门从事折磨的恶魔类型，拷掠魔也是一流的战士和雇佣兵。由于他们作为恶魔的折磨者而声名狼藉，他们常常受到其他恶魔的轻视，甚至偶尔会被殴打或杀害，因此他们经常结伴旅行。他们的残忍在九层地狱中众所周知，他们对痛苦的狂欢赋予了他们的名字。折磨恶魔的另一个显著特征是他们的贪婪：他们不侍奉特定的主人，他们的忠诚必须用金钱购买。",
	"Excruciarchs appear almost humanoid in size and shape. Their skin is usually pale shades of white or red, and hair doesn't grow anywhere on their body. To conceal their identity and lend themselves some form of protection, almost all pain devils wear masks made from various types of leather, often adorned with spikes, horns, or ridges.": "拷痛领主们看起来几乎与人类大小和形状相似。他们的皮肤通常是苍白或红色的，身上没有任何头发。为了隐藏他们的身份并为自己提供一定程度的保护，几乎所有的痛苦恶魔都戴着由各种类型的皮革制成的面具，通常装饰有尖刺、角或脊。",
	"When an excruciarch enters battle, they activate a unique ability to inflict pain upon their adversaries. Excruciarchs thrive on even their own pain and they almost always fight to the death.": "当一名拷痛使者(Excruciarch)进入战斗时，他们会激活一项独特的能力，让对手感受到痛苦。拷痛使者擅长甚至享受自己的痛苦，几乎总是战斗到死亡。",
	"Ramius Dangremond is the commander of the Hellriders of Elturel. He never wanted the position, but because of the many deaths within the ranks of the order, he had to step up. His friend and fellow Hellrider, Barachiel, was the main reason he was able to grow into a capable commander. The loss of his friend saddens Ramius, and the news of his imprisonment within the Nine Hells gnaws at his soul.": "Ramius Dangremond是埃尔图雷尔的地狱骑士团指挥官。他从未想过要这个职位，但由于骑士团内部众多成员的死亡，他不得不挺身而出。他的朋友和同僚地狱骑士，巴拉基尔，是他能够成长为一名有能力的指挥官的主要原因。失去朋友让Ramius感到悲伤，而他朋友被囚禁在九层地狱的消息更是折磨着他的灵魂。",
	"Ramius is a natural horseman and a gifted athlete. The soldiers he leads often say that there isn't anything that Ramius can't mount or ride. He's ridden horses, mammoths, and machines into battle. Loyalty, honor, and duty are virtues that Ramius upholds. He fears nothing other than losing those he cares for.": "Ramius (拉缪斯) 是一位天生的骑手和天赋异禀的运动员。他领导的士兵经常说，没有什么是 Ramius 不能驯服或骑乘的。他曾骑马、猛犸象和机械参加战斗。忠诚、荣誉和责任是 Ramius 坚守的美德。除了失去他关心的人，他不害怕任何事情。",
	"Sarevok Anchev is a powerful Deathstalker. He is also one of the Bhaalspawn, the mortal offspring of the dead god Bhaal. Sarevok attempted to reclaim the divine seat of the Lord of Murder vacated by his immortal father's demise, but his plans were thwarted when he was slain by his half-brother, Abdel Adrian, who rejected his heritage and fought against his Bhaalspawn siblings.": "Sarevok Anchev是一名强大的死亡行刺者。他也是巴尔之神的凡间后裔之一，巴尔是一位已故的神祇。Sarevok试图夺回由他不朽父亲死亡而空缺的谋杀之神之位，但他的计划被他的同父异母兄弟Abdel Adrian击败，后者拒绝了自己的遗传，并与巴尔后裔兄弟们对抗。",
	"Sarevok's spirit was sent to the Abyss as punishment. There he eventually crossed paths with Abdel a second time when his noble-hearted brother ventured into the lower realms on a dangerous quest to stop another Bhaalspawn named Melissan. Sarevok agreed to help Abdel kill Melissan, on the condition that Abdel helped him escape the eternal torments of the Abyss.": "Sarevok的灵魂被送往深渊受罚。在那里，他最终再次与阿卜杜勒相遇，当时他的高贵兄弟冒险前往下层领域，执行危险的任务，阻止另一个名为Melissan的巴尔斯邦。Sarevok同意帮助Abdel杀死Melissan，条件是Abdel帮助他逃离深渊的永恒折磨。",
	"Abdel agreed, and Sarevok was reborn into the mortal world. After his rebirth, Sarevok was true to his word, and the two brothers fought side by side against their half-sister. Ultimately Melissan was defeated, and Sarevok was granted a second chance at life.": "阿卜杜尔同意了，萨瑞沃克重生在凡间。在重生后，萨瑞沃克信守诺言，两兄弟并肩对抗他们的同父异母的妹妹。最终，梅丽珊被打败，萨瑞沃克获得了第二次生命的机会。",
	"With his prodigious strength, his legendary skill in battle, and the Sword of Chaos—a life-stealing, enchanted blade—Sarevok became a famous (and feared) mercenary. Yet his many accomplishments brought him no joy. He felt no thrill at victory in battle, no delight in the routing of his enemies. The power he accumulated was bitter as ashes on his tongue, and he became a man haunted by his former life. The realization that no earthly achievements could ever compare to what he once almost had—immortality and godhood—left him broken and empty.": "凭借着他惊人的力量、传奇的战斗技巧以及深具威慑力的混沌之剑——一把能夺取生命的魔法剑——Sarevok成为了一名著名（并且令人畏惧）的雇佣兵。然而，他的诸多成就并未给他带来任何快乐。他在战斗胜利中感受不到激动，对敌人溃败也无法感到喜悦。他所积累的力量如同口中苦涩如灰，他成为了一个被过去生活所困扰的人。他意识到，任何尘世成就都无法与他曾经差一步之遥拥有的永生和神格相提并论，这让他感到破碎和空虚。",
	"Sarevok plunged into a deep despair. To numb his pain, he indulged in every vice imaginable, squandering his wealth and health on alcohol, drugs, and fleeting comforts. While his divine heritage slowed his aging, it did not stop it entirely, and after decades of self-abuse he was eventually reduced to an old man begging in the streets of Baldur's Gate.": "萨瑞沃克（Sarevok）陷入了深深的绝望之中。为了麻痹自己的痛苦，他沉溺于各种恶习，将自己的财富和健康浪费在酒精、毒品和转瞬即逝的安慰上。尽管他的神圣血统减缓了他的衰老速度，但并没有完全阻止，经过几十年的自虐之后，他最终沦为一个在博德之门（Baldur's Gate）街头乞讨的老人。",
	"This was how his father—Bhaal, the reborn god of murder—found him. Bhaal recognized his own divine spark in the pathetic old man, and he sensed Sarevok still had potential. Bhaal recruited him to become the high priest of his fledgling clergy, giving Sarevok new purpose... and another chance to become an agent of death and destruction.": "这就是他的父亲——(Bhaal，重生之神)——找到他的方式。Bhaal 在这个可怜的老人身上认出了自己神圣的火花，并感知到 Sarevok 仍然有潜力。Bhaal 招募他成为他新兴神职团的高祭司，给了 Sarevok 新的目标...以及再次成为死亡和毁灭之使的机会。",
	"Tearing through the skies of the Nine Hells, shredwings aren't only a constant menace to mortal and fiendish travelers, but a reminder of the cruelties of one of Hell's worst overlords. Though Malagard was cast down from the throne of Malbolge and her bloated body shattered, her wickedness remains in the spite and cruelty of her creations.": "在九层地狱的天空中肆虐的撕翼恶魔，不仅是对凡人和邪恶旅行者的持续威胁，也是地狱最恶劣的领主之一残忍行为的提醒。尽管(Malagard)从(Malbolge)的王座上被推翻，她那臃肿的身躯已经支离破碎，但她邪恶的本质仍然存在于她所创造的恶意和残忍之中。",
	"At first glance, shredwings appear to be bats or pterodactyls, with a spined body between two great veined wings terminating in a jagged head. They seem to have an ever-open beak, but upon closer scrutiny this shows to be a pair of vicious spikes. Although they seem like horrific flying creatures, the actual truth of their origins makes them even more terrible. Malagard was earthbound and one of the many things she was furiously envious of was the ability of others to fly. One of her pastimes was to tear the wings from Fiends who had displeased her and give them a vile and unnatural life of their own, discarding the mutilated devils and shaping their amputated parts into something new and ghastly. Shredwings are the results of her hobby, now feral and endemic to many parts of the Nine Hells.": "乍一看，撕翼者看起来像是蝙蝠或翼手龙，有着一个长有刺的身体，两只巨大的有脉络的翅膀之间，以一个锯齿状的头收尾。它们似乎有着永远张开的喙，但仔细观察后会发现这实际上是一对凶猛的尖刺。尽管它们看起来像是可怕的飞行生物，但它们起源的真相让它们变得更加可怕。玛拉加德曾经是地面生物，她狂妄地嫉妒其他生物能够飞行的能力。她的一种消遣是从那些惹她不快的恶魔身上撕下翅膀，赋予它们一种邪恶而不自然的生命，将被残忍抛弃的恶魔重新塑造成一些新的可怕事物。撕翼者就是她这种爱好的产物，如今已经变得野性化，并且在九层地狱的许多地方都有分布。",
	"Shredwings are driven by a desire to inflict pain, still possessed by the malice of their original creator. They patrol the skies of the Nine Hells and descend in shrieking flocks on anything weak enough to torment. When they have winged creatures at their mercy, they mob their victim in the air until they can tear away their target's wings. They carry the trophies to their high roosts, where the tattered vanes are transformed into a new shredwing under the caustic ministrations of the 'parents'. For wingless prey, they have other practices. Whilst they harry with claws and beak, they look out for a chance to latch onto the backs of their prey. Driving the spikes of their heads between the shoulders of their victims they enact a terrible merging, becoming a set of wings attached to the creature and carrying them off. They slowly absorb the life-force of their victim, delighting in their pain and fear. Over time they take over their prey's limbs and body, returning to attack any leftover companions, delighting in the distress their puppeteering causes. Most often they leave the head until last, enjoying the screams and pleas of the luckless creature they've usurped.": "撕翼者们被一种渴望造成痛苦的欲望所驱使，仍然被他们最初的创造者的恶意所控制。他们在九层地狱的天空中巡逻，对任何足够弱小以供折磨的东西发动尖叫的群袭。当他们控制住有翅膀的生物时，他们会在空中围攻受害者，直到能够撕下目标的翅膀。他们将战利品带到他们的高处栖息地，在那里，这些破烂的翅膀会在“父母”的腐蚀性照料下转化为一对新的撕翼者。对于没有翅膀的猎物，他们有其他的做法。在用爪子和喙折磨的同时，他们寻找机会抓住猎物的背部。将他们头部的尖刺驱入受害者的肩膀之间，他们实施了一种可怕的融合，变成了连接在生物身上的一对翅膀，将其带走。他们慢慢吸收受害者的生命力，沉醉于他们的痛苦和恐惧之中。随着时间的推移，他们接管了猎物的四肢和身体，然后返回袭击任何剩余的同伴，沉醉于他们操纵傀儡所带来的痛苦。他们通常会把头留到最后，享受着他们篡夺的不幸生物的尖叫和恳求。",
	"There is little bad in the Nine Hells that devils can't make worse. Shredwings are unruly and vicious creatures but determined devils can trap them and break them into a form of domestication. Particularly ingenious hunting Fiends, aided by the souls of evil rangers, have trained packs of shredwings to do their bidding, tracking prey across the hostile plains of the Nine Hells and attacking on command. The creatures remain mutinous at best, and woe betide any handler who shows weakness or lets prey get the better of them.": "在九层地狱中，恶魔们能让一切恶劣变得更糟。撕翼兽是难以驯服且凶残的生物，但决心的恶魔可以将它们困住并驯化成一种家畜。特别是那些富有创意的狩猎恶魔，在邪恶游侠的灵魂的帮助下，训练出一群群撕翼兽来执行他们的命令，在九层地狱的恶劣平原上追踪猎物，并在指令下发动攻击。这些生物至多保持着叛逆的本性，任何表现出软弱或让猎物占上风的驯兽者都将倒霉。",
	"One of the only draconic beings that makes its home in the Nine Hells, the Styx dragon is an aquatic creature that lives within the River Styx. The waters of the Styx have no effect on its mental faculties or memories, and their breath weapon replicates the effects of the Styx. Their diet consists mostly of devils foolish enough to wander close to the banks of the Styx, though they prefer mortals and corpses over Fiends. Occasional Styx dragons have been spotted in non-infernal planes, possibly by traveling the Styx to their destination.": "在九层地狱中唯一居住的龙类生物之一，冥河龙是一种水生生物，生活在冥河中。冥河的水对它的精神能力或记忆没有影响，它们的吐息武器复制了冥河的效果。它们的饮食主要是愚蠢到靠近冥河岸边的恶魔，尽管它们更喜欢凡人和尸体而不是恶魔。偶尔会有冥河龙被发现出现在非地狱位面，可能是通过冥河前往目的地。",
	"Unlike other Dragons, the scales of the Styx dragon have no effect on their capabilities, and range from darker hues all the way up to chromatic scales, though they always appear muddied. They have no wings and very small limbs, relying primarily on their tails for mobility and combat. Their serpentine body lends itself to muddy nests along the banks of the Styx and quick underwater travel. Good captains know where Styx dragon clutches are along the river, and steer their boats specifically to avoid the creatures.": "与其他龙不同，冥河龙的鳞片对它们的能力没有影响，颜色从较深的色调一直到彩色鳞片，尽管它们看起来总是泥泞的。它们没有翅膀，四肢非常小，主要依靠尾巴进行移动和战斗。它们蛇一般的身体适合在冥河岸边泥泞的巢穴中生活，并能快速在水下移动。优秀的船长知道冥河龙的窝巢在河流上的位置，并专门避开这些生物。",
	"A long-serving cleric of Cyric, the god of lies, Tiax is absolutely certain of many things—most of them entirely untrue. After twenty years in Cyric's clergy, Tiax's mind has been twisted by the god's many tricks. Still, even so flavored by fantasy and deception, the favor of a god often proves a very powerful boon indeed. Whatever dire trouble Tiax finds himself in, even if it be the flames of the Nine Hells, his god will devise means of delivering him to safety—though often just by the skin of his teeth.": "作为Cyric，谎言之神的资深神职人员，Tiax对许多事情非常确定——其中大多数都是完全不真实的。在Cyric的神职中度过了二十年后，Tiax的思想已经被神的许多诡计扭曲。即便如此，即使被幻想和欺骗所影响，获得神的青睐通常也是一种非常强大的恩惠。无论Tiax陷入何种困境，即使是九层地狱的烈焰，他的神都会想出办法将他安全解救出来——尽管通常是在千钧一发之际。",
	"All of these near misses and improbable escapes have only solidified Tiax's delusions of grandeur. Though he is well aware that it is Cyric's divine interference which saves him, Tiax tells everyone he encounters that he is actually a powerful sorcerer and thus hides his piety to Cyric and the divine power he has been granted in return.": "所有这些险些失手和不可思议的逃脱只是巩固了提亚克斯（Tiax）对自己伟大幻想的信念。尽管他很清楚是西瑞克（Cyric）的神圣干预拯救了他，提亚克斯告诉他遇到的每个人，他实际上是一名强大的巫师，因此隐藏了他对西瑞克和他所获得的神圣力量的虔诚。",
	"As one might expect, Tiax's foremost attributes are exaggeration and deceit. Unfortunately, for the unsuspecting, Tiax's unthreatening and absurd demeanor can grant the illusion of harmlessness. His many lies appear outlandish and easily dismissed, and his erratic behavior borders on complete buffoonery. Some might even find his colorful, chaotic personality to be charming. Certainly, Koh Tam seems to tolerate him for one reason or another. But make no mistake, Tiax is dangerous. The wise should be wary.": "正如人们所预料的那样，提亚克斯(Tiax)的主要特点是夸大和欺骗。不幸的是，对于毫无戒心的人来说，提亚克斯看似无害且荒谬的举止可能会给人一种无害的错觉。他的谎言多得离谱，容易被驳斥，而他的反常行为几乎达到了彻底的小丑表演。有些人甚至可能觉得他那种色彩斑斓、混乱不堪的个性很迷人。显然，柯·坦(Koh Tam)似乎出于某种原因容忍他。但不要误解，提亚克斯是危险的。明智的人应该保持警惕。",
	"The nine hells can only dream of the perfect oppression which mortals bring upon each other.": "九地狱只能梦想着人类彼此施加的完美压迫。",
	"Alongside devils and monsters, the Nine Hells have given birth to more nebulous threats. Even raw negative emotion can be personified in the darkest reaches of the lower planes. Congealing into a shape that knows only hunger and the need to hunt. It stalks those filled with fears and insecurities that they refuse to acknowledge.": "在与恶魔和怪物并存的同时，九层地狱也孕育出更加模糊的威胁。即使是原始的负面情绪也可以被具象化在下层位面最黑暗的地方。它凝聚成一种只懂得饥饿和狩猎需求的形态。它潜伏在那些充满恐惧和不愿承认的不安全感的人身边。",
	"Tyrant shadows are a threat unique to the Nine Hells. Mortals in the Nine Hells dwell in agony and terror by definition. However, the life of a devil is seldom happier. The infernal hierarchy is harsh and those above constantly abuse the Fiends beneath them whilst fearing usurpation at every turn. In contrast to the unruly hosts of the Abyss, devils are never permitted to give vent to the bitterness that is their lot, bound to a show of discipline and obedience. This festering misery, given no other outlet, manifests as an independent creature that breaks from the devil who generated it to pursue its own malevolent life. Tyrant shadows most often appear as huge-mawed stalking reptiles made from writhing shadows, unless they take on specific forms to exploit the fears of their prey.": "暴君暗影是九层地狱独有的威胁。在九层地狱，凡人注定要生活在痛苦和恐惧中。然而，恶魔的生活很少会更快乐。地狱的等级制度严苛，那些高于他们的人不断地虐待着他们下面的恶魔，同时又害怕在任何时候被篡位。与混乱的深渊军团相比，恶魔从不被允许表露他们所受苦难的怨恨，他们被束缚于纪律和服从的表现之中。这种潜在的痛苦，没有其他出口，会表现为一个独立的生物，它脱离了生成它的恶魔，追求自己邪恶的生活。暴君暗影通常出现为巨大口的潜行爬行动物，由扭曲的阴影构成，除非它们采取特定形态来利用猎物的恐惧。",
	"Tyrant shadows are strongly attracted to the kind of suppressed negative emotions that gave rise to them. The minds of strong mortals valiantly enduring the horrors of the Nine Hells without complaint draw them from far away, and they hunger both for the flesh and the fear such prey generate. A truly satisfying feast for the tyrants must be prepared properly. They stalk their targets over long hours, telepathically sensing what is most feared and shifting their forms to provide glimpses and hints of terror wherever their target looks. Mortals who break easily, giving swift vent to their fear or flying into berserk rages, are of little interest to them. A fear that slowly erodes through its host's iron discipline is savored like a well-aged wine. For the same reason, they gleefully prey on middling and lesser devils whose lives are a constant battle between bitterness and discipline. Those few mortals who are so confident in themselves as to know no fear at all—the most focused of monks or blessed of paladins perhaps—are effectively invisible to tyrant shadows.": "暴君阴影对那种激发它们的被压抑的负面情绪极具吸引力。那些坚强的凡人心灵在不抱怨地勇敢忍受九层地狱的恐惧时，会从远处吸引它们，它们既渴望肉体，也渴望这种猎物所产生的恐惧。对于暴君来说，一场真正令人满意的盛宴必须得到适当准备。它们会在长时间内悄悄跟踪目标，通过心灵感应感知目标最害怕的东西，并改变形态在目标看向的地方提供恐怖的一瞥和暗示。那些容易崩溃、迅速释放恐惧或陷入狂暴愤怒的凡人对它们来说毫无兴趣。一个缓慢侵蚀宿主铁一般纪律的恐惧就像陈年美酒一样被品尝。出于同样的原因，它们欣然捕食那些生活在苦涩和纪律之间不断挣扎的中级和低级恶魔。那些极度自信以至于根本不知道恐惧的少数凡人——也许是最专注的僧侣或受祝福的圣骑士——对暴君阴影来说实际上是看不见的。",
	"Every tyrant shadow was spawned from the resentful core of a particular devil before taking up its own existence, and the presence of \"their\" devil continues to sustain the tyrant. As the devil rises in the internal hierarchy, so the tyrant grows stronger. As the tyrant hunts and feasts, so the devil's inner bitterness grows, driving them to greater acts of evil, and thus leading to their advancement. Much as they might deny it, even the greatest of devils are consumed with negative emotions. Archdevils command whole planes yet hate and envy the gods. Somewhere perhaps even Asmodeus has a stalking shadow feeding his malice even as his great status empowers it.": "每一个暴君的阴影都源自某个特定恶魔内心的怨恨核心，然后才开始拥有自己的存在，而\"他们\"的恶魔继续维系着这个暴君。随着恶魔在内部等级制度中的上升，暴君变得更加强大。当暴君狩猎和盛宴时，恶魔内心的苦涩也在增长，驱使它们做出更邪恶的行为，从而导致它们的晋升。即使是最伟大的恶魔也会被消极情绪所困扰，虽然他们可能会否认。大执政恶魔统治整个位面，却憎恨并嫉妒众神。也许甚至阿斯莫迪厄斯本人也有一个潜伏的阴影在喂养他的恶意，即使他的伟大地位也在增强它。",
	"There are always mortals who believe they can outwit the powers of the Nine Hells. One strategy is for a powerful evil creature to pledge its soul to the inferno, then seek the eternal unlife of a vampire to cheat the devils of their prize. The devils, of course, have seen it all before. Specialist teams hunt down the offenders and haul them to the Nine Hells where they're reshaped into vorvolakas, forever hungry for mortal blood in an underworld where such a commodity is vanishingly rare.": "总有些凡人相信他们可以智胜九层地狱的力量。其中一种策略是，一个强大的邪恶生物将其灵魂奉献给地狱，然后寻求成为吸血鬼的永恒不死之身，以欺骗恶魔们的奖赏。当然，恶魔们早已见惯不惊。专门的小组会追捕这些罪犯，将他们拖往九层地狱，在那里他们会被改造成伏尔瓦卡斯，永远渴望凡人的鲜血，在一个这种商品极为稀缺的地下世界中。",
	"A mockery of their original form, vorvolakas appear like vast tusked bats with a humanoid twist to their forms. Some faint semblance of their original features can just be discerned in their new bestial visage, just as an echo of their memories and personality persists in their fractured minds. They're almost never still or silent, shrieking out their gnawing hunger in their keening voices, jittering and clawing at one another, or circling like vultures across the brazen skies of the Nine Hells. Even as normal vampires are driven by their appetites, transformation into a vorvolaka increases that appetite a hundredfold, but the blood of mortals remains the only meal that sates them for even a moment. Seeing haughty vampires turned into ravenous monsters by their constant unfulfillable hunger is a torment that devils find highly amusing.": "对于他们原本的形态进行了嘲弄，沃沃拉卡（vorvolakas）看起来像是巨大的长牙蝙蝠，但在他们的形态中加入了人形的扭曲。他们新的野兽面容中仍能隐约辨认出原有特征的影子，就像他们破碎的思维中仍残留着记忆和个性的回声一样。他们几乎从不静止或无声，用尖锐的声音尖叫出他们的痛苦饥渴，彼此间狂乱地颤抖和抓挠，或者像秃鹫一样在九层地狱的铜天空中盘旋。即使正常的吸血鬼也受到自己的欲望驱使，转变为沃沃拉卡会使这种欲望增加一百倍，但凡人的血液仍是唯一能稍稍满足他们的食物。看到傲慢的吸血鬼被他们无休止的饥饿转变为贪婪的怪物，这种折磨让恶魔们觉得非常有趣。",
	"Many powerful devils—especially in the upper layers of Avernus and Dis—keep dovecotes of starving vorvolakas, tolerating their noise and squabbling in exchange for the chief service they provide. The creatures can scent the blood of mortals from miles away, flying into a frenzy at the first hint of a living being. Sometimes the monsters are kept caged, simply serving as a warning system so devils know that mortals are about. More often they're released into the skies to track down the intruders, with infernal huntsmen following in their wake to pick up the pieces.": "在阿弗纳斯（Avernus）和迪斯（Dis）的上层，许多强大的恶魔都养着饥饿的沃沃拉卡（vorvolakas）并容忍它们的噪音和争吵，作为它们提供的主要服务的交换条件。这些生物能够从几英里外嗅到凡人的血腥气味，一有生物的迹象它们就会陷入狂热状态。有时这些怪物被关在笼子里，只是作为一个警示系统，让恶魔知道有凡人在附近。更常见的情况是它们被释放到天空中追踪入侵者，地狱猎手紧随其后收拾残局。",
	"When they find living prey the vorvolakas descend in great squalling flocks, desperate to rend the mortals open and glut themselves on blood. They use their hooked claws and tusks to rip away armor and open up their prey, attacking with utter disregard for their own safety. Their flesh regenerates from most wounds—or else they would tear one another to pieces in their agony—and their hunger is such that only those of strongest faith can hold them back with prayer and holy symbol. Their screaming cries rend the ears of listeners, not only physically painful but imprinting the creatures' deep misery on all who hear. So evident is the despair of the creatures, their horror at their own tormented state, that those who have fought them and survived find themselves more moved to pity than any other emotion.": "当沃沃拉卡斯发现活生物猎物时，它们会成群降临，发出巨大的尖叫声，渴望撕裂凡人的身体，饱食鲜血。它们利用钩爪和獠牙撕裂盔甲，撕开猎物，攻击时毫不顾忌自身安全。它们的肉体可以从大多数伤口中再生——否则它们会在痛苦中互相撕成碎片——它们的饥饿如此之大，只有信仰最坚定的人才能用祈祷和圣符阻止它们。它们尖叫的哭声撕裂听者的耳膜，不仅在身体上疼痛，还将这些生物的深深痛苦印在所有听到声音的人心中。这些生物的绝望是如此明显，它们对自己受折磨的状态感到恐惧，以至于那些与它们战斗并幸存下来的人会发现自己更多地被怜悯所感动，而非其他任何情感。",
	"Created through the sacrifice of other devils, both alive and dead, war devils vary in size and shape, but not personality. They crave combat and are highly aggressive, often commanding legions of lesser devils in wars. While they greatly enjoy bullying weaker creatures and exerting their dominance, they're highly submissive towards more powerful creatures and higher ranked devils.": "通过牺牲其他恶魔而创造出来的，战争恶魔在大小和形状上各不相同，但性格却相似。它们渴望战斗，极具攻击性，常常指挥着一群较低级的恶魔参加战争。虽然它们喜欢欺凌较弱的生物并展示统治地位，但对更强大的生物和高级恶魔却极度顺从。",
	"War devils are also extremely loyal to their creators, following practically any order given to them. When not taking orders, war devils are clever enough to command and make decisions on their own, making them extremely talented generals.": "战争恶魔对他们的创造者也是极其忠诚的，几乎会遵循给予他们的任何命令。当没有接受命令时，战争恶魔足够聪明，能够自行指挥并做出决策，使他们成为极具才能的将军。",
	"Because of their construction, the appearance of war devils varies. That said, there are a few features that are common among most of their kind. Almost all war devils have thick, leathery wings, as well as massive, curved horns and sharpened teeth. They're also usually massive in size, having been created from multiple other devils, with the larger ones usually having higher-ranked positions. Though they prefer to use polearms of all kinds, war devils are also fully capable unarmed.": "由于它们的构造，战争恶魔的外观各不相同。尽管如此，大多数战争恶魔都具有一些共同特征。几乎所有的战争恶魔都有厚实的皮翼，还有巨大、弯曲的角和锋利的牙齿。它们通常体型庞大，由多个其他恶魔组成，体型较大的通常担任较高级别的职位。尽管它们更喜欢使用各种长柄武器，战争恶魔也能够熟练地进行徒手战斗。",
	"Once a mighty angel charged with watching the tides of the Blood War, Zariel succumbed to the corrupting influence of the Nine Hells and fell from grace. Asmodeus admired Zariel's passion for war and offered her rulership of Avernus. She accepted his offer and was transformed by Asmodeus into an archdevil.": "曾经是一位强大的天使，负责观察血战潮汐的扎瑞尔(Zariel)最终屈服于九层地狱的腐化影响，堕落了。阿斯莫德斯(Asmodeus)欣赏扎瑞尔对战争的热情，并提供给她统治阿维诺斯(Avernus)的机会。她接受了他的提议，并被阿斯莫德斯转变为一位大恶魔。",
	"Zariel's rise came at the expense of Bel, her pit fiend predecessor. Zariel and Bel hate each other. To keep Bel busy and out of her sight, Zariel tasks him with forging weapons, armor, and gruesome demon-slaying machines.": "Zariel（扎瑞尔）的崛起是以她的前任深渊恶魔贝尔（Bel）为代价的。Zariel和Bel彼此憎恨。为了让Bel忙碌并远离她的视线，Zariel让他负责锻造武器、盔甲和可怕的屠魔机器。",
	"Zariel makes her lair in a basalt citadel that rises up in Avernus. The stronghold, covering five square miles, is surrounded by walls reinforced with high turrets.": "Zariel（萨瑞尔）将她的巢穴建在阿弗尼斯（Avernus）中一座玄武岩城堡中。这座占地五平方英里的要塞被高塔加固的墙壁环绕着。",
	"Zythan, like many other Halruaans, spent his early years studying the arcane arts. His talent in Divination magic made him particularly useful to the Conclave, and they quickly sought him out. Under their tutelage, his skill flourished, and he became a powerful mage. Those that know him personally recount his matter-of-fact personality, his green hair, and his third eye that seems to open when he performs magic. He rarely speaks of himself, however, choosing instead to focus his attention on the future.": "赛坦(Zythan)，像许多其他哈鲁安人一样，童年时期就致力于研究奥术。他在占卜魔法方面的天赋使他对议会特别有用，他们迅速找到了他。在他们的指导下，他的技艺蓬勃发展，成为一名强大的法师。那些与他亲近的人描述他的性格直率，他的绿色头发，以及他施展魔法时似乎会睁开的第三只眼。然而，他很少谈论自己，而是选择将注意力集中在未来。",
	"When he first received an official position within the Conclave, Zythan wanted to prove himself. He spent countless hours peering into the future and examining potential outcomes. One fateful night, he just barely caught sight of a forbidden ritual being prepared—a ritual that could cost the lives of many Halruaans. Because of his sight, the Conclave was able to intervene in time, and he was quickly promoted and showered with praise.": "当赛坦(Zythan)第一次在议会(Conclave)内获得官职时，他渴望证明自己。他花费无数小时凝视未来，审视潜在的结果。在一个命运般的夜晚，他勉强看到了一场准备中的禁忌仪式——一场可能导致许多哈鲁安人丧生的仪式。由于他的洞察力，议会得以及时干预，他很快就被提拔并受到了赞扬。",
	"For the past few months, Zythan has felt like something was off: at first, he suspected another ritual within Halruaa. He requisitioned the help of the other diviners, as well as a powerful Crystal Ball, and together they were able to piece together a vision. The dark lord of the Nine Hells, Asmodeus, will unleash a great evil very soon. Though the Conclave often stays out of non-Halruaan affairs, they had no choice but to act. It is for this reason that the adventurers were called to Halruaa.": "在过去的几个月里，Zythan一直感觉有些不对劲：起初，他怀疑是Halruaa内部的另一个仪式。他请求其他占卜者的帮助，以及一颗强大的水晶球，他们一起得以拼凑出一个预示。九层地狱的黑暗领主，阿斯莫德斯(Asmodeus)，将很快释放一种巨大的邪恶。虽然议会经常不干涉Halruaa以外的事务，但他们别无选择，只能采取行动。正因为如此，冒险者们被召集到Halruaa。",
	"Zythan's skill in arcane magic, while particularly focused on Divination, extends to every school. While he lacks proficiency in martial combat, he can wield both offensive and defensive magic effectively. Outside of his magical talent, he is also known to be highly intelligent, though his social skills could use work. Much of his time is spent viewing alternate futures and preparing for potential dangers, leaving little for himself. He often goes without meals until he starts to feel weak, and if he had friends, they might be concerned about how much time he spends working.": "赛坦(Zythan)在奥术魔法方面的技能，尤其专注于预言术，但也涵盖了每个学派。虽然他在武术战斗方面缺乏熟练度，但他能有效地运用攻击和防御魔法。除了他的魔法天赋，他也以极高的智慧著称，尽管他的社交技能有待提高。他大部分时间都在观察不同的未来并为潜在危险做准备，几乎没有时间留给自己。他经常忽略进食，直到感到虚弱为止，如果他有朋友的话，他们可能会担心他工作的时间太长。"
