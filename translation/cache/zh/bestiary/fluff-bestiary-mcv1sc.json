	"An asteroid spider is a menace native to Wildspace and the Astral Sea. A full-grown specimen has a body 30 feet in diameter and legs that are at least 30 feet long. When it wraps its legs tightly around its body and closes its eyes, the asteroid spider resembles nothing so much as a giant, lifeless rock in space—hence its name.": "小行星蜘蛛是一种原产于威尔兹空间和星海的威胁。一个完整的标本有一个直径30英尺的身体，腿至少有30英尺长。当它把腿紧紧地缠在身上并闭上眼睛时，小行星蜘蛛就像太空中一块巨大的、没有生命的岩石--因此它的名字就叫小行星蜘蛛。",
	"An asteroid spider has its own gravity plane and air envelope, as well as multiple spinnerets with which it can create web strands. Its living brain functions like a{@i spelljamming helm}, allowing the spider to travel through Wildspace without a ship. It often haunts asteroid belts, lurking among normal asteroids until a spelljamming ship comes close enough to be detected. The spider then snares the ship before using web strands to catch crew members and reel them toward its snapping jaws.": "小行星蜘蛛有自己的重力平面和空气包络层，以及多个喷丝板，它可以用这些喷丝板制造网线。它的大脑功能就像一个{@i spelljamming helm}，允许蜘蛛在没有飞船的情况下在威尔兹空间旅行。它经常出没于小行星带，潜伏在普通的小行星中，直到有法术干扰的飞船靠近才被发现。然后，蜘蛛会抓住这艘船，然后用网线抓住船员，把他们卷到它的大嘴里。",
	"Clockwork horrors are ruthless insectile automatons—eldritch machines encased in adamantine or some other precious metal. They roam Wildspace in commandeered spelljamming ships, gathering the precious metals and crystals they need to build more of their kind. Clockwork horrors have no goal beyond replication and will stop at nothing to create new clockwork horrors. The time it takes for a clockwork horror to build another of its kind, assuming it has the requisite materials, is approximately ten days.": "发条恐怖是无情的昆虫式自动机--被金刚砂或其他贵重金属包裹着的恶魔机器。他们乘坐被征用的法术干扰船在威尔兹空间游荡，收集他们需要的贵重金属和水晶，以制造更多的同类。发条恐怖除了复制之外没有其他目标，它们会不惜一切代价创造新的发条恐怖。假设一个发条恐怖拥有必要的材料，它制造另一个同类的时间大约是10天。",
	"The body of a clockwork horror is about two feet in diameter, but the legs give it an overall diameter of four feet. Embedded in the front of its head is a crystal that enables the clockwork horror to see.": "钟表恐怖的身体直径约为两英尺，但腿部使它的总直径达到四英尺。在它的头的前面嵌入了一个水晶，使发条恐怖能够看到。",
	"Clockwork horrors communicate with each other by means of clicks, whirs, and similar mechanical sounds that imitate the Thri-kreen language perfectly, leading some to speculate the first clockwork horror was the brainchild of a thri-kreen artificer. A horror can also emit light from its crystal eye, issuing dot-and-dash messages to other creatures that can see the light. Creatures besides clockwork horrors can learn this blinking light code, which is called Ziklight.": "发条恐怖通过点击、呼啸和类似的机械声音来相互交流，这些声音完美地模仿了Thri-kreen的语言，导致一些人猜测第一个发条恐怖是Thri-kreen工匠的创意。恐怖者还能从它的水晶眼里发出光，向其他能看到光的生物发出点和线的信息。除了发条恐怖之外，其他生物也可以学习这种闪烁的光线代码，这被称为Ziklight。",
	"When another creature gets in its way, a clockwork horror attacks that creature with its razor-sharp mandibles and two tiny rotating saws mounted at the tips of its forelimbs. A horror can also discharge bolts of lightning from a short lightning rod embedded in its body.": "当另一个生物挡住它的去路时，发条恐怖就会用它那锋利的下颚和安装在前肢顶端的两把微小的旋转锯攻击那个生物。恐怖者还可以从其身体中嵌入的短避雷针中发射闪电。",
	"When a clockwork horror dies, the magic that created it consumes it over a period of 1 minute. Its metallic body and crystal eye degrade rapidly until nothing is left but a small heap of glittering dust.": "当发条恐怖死亡时，创造它的魔法会在1分钟内消耗掉它。它的金属身体和水晶眼迅速退化，直到只剩下一小堆闪闪发光的灰尘。",
	"From beyond the stars, a Great Old One whispers promises of reality-defying knowledge and world-bending power. When a wizard or a warlock hears that whisper and listens too intently, they might set foot on the twisting path toward becoming an eldritch lich.": "从星空之外，一位伟大的老者低声承诺，他的知识可以颠覆现实，力量可以改变世界。当一个巫师或术士听到这个低语并过于专注地倾听时，他们可能会踏上扭曲的道路，成为一个长生的巫师。",
	"Like other liches, eldritch liches are spellcasters who have cheated death, but an eldritch lich does so by allowing a Great Old One to implant a Far Realm parasite in the lich. That parasite bestows undeath upon the spellcaster and causes strange tentacles to sprout from the body. The parasite's mouth is visible on the lich's torso, and the parasite guards the lich against destruction, reviving the lich a few days after death. Canny foes can sabotage an eldritch lich's revival by slaying the lich in a magic circle, thereby forcing the lich to return in a distorted form, robbed of most of its power.": "和其他地衣一样，长生地衣也是欺骗了死亡的施法者，但长生地衣是通过让一个伟大的老者在地衣中植入远界寄生虫来实现的。这种寄生虫赋予施法者不死之身，并导致奇怪的触手从身体里长出来。寄生虫的嘴在巫师的躯干上是可见的，寄生虫保护巫师不受破坏，在巫师死后几天就会复活。狡猾的敌人可以通过在魔法阵中杀死巫师来破坏长生不老的巫师的复活，从而迫使巫师以扭曲的形式返回，并被剥夺了大部分的力量。",
	"An eldritch lich constantly hears bizarre whispers from the Far Realm, to which the lich nods and mutters. Occasionally, the lich uses its telepathy to share those whispers with the minds around it.": "一个长生不老的巫师不断地听到来自远方世界的诡异低语，巫师对此点头并喃喃自语。偶尔，巫师会用心灵感应与周围的人分享这些耳语。",
	"Multiple entities bear the title Great Old One. You may roll on the Great Old Ones table to determine which entity gave an eldritch lich its parasite.": "多个实体都有 \"伟大的旧人 \"的称号。你可以在 \"伟大的旧人 \"表上掷骰子，以确定是哪个实体给了长生者寄生虫。",
	"Tharizdun, the Chained God": "塔里兹敦，被锁住的神",
	"Dendar, the Night Serpent": "邓达，夜蛇",
	"Zargon, the Returner": "回归者扎尔贡",
	"That Which Lurks": "潜伏着的那东西",
	"I've encountered a creature unlike any other in the multiverse: a flickering mirror tumbling across the Astral Sea toward some unknown destination, with a beholder's distorted reflection in its surface. Initially, I feared it was some kind of vessel. Now I believe the beholder was the mirror's prisoner.": "我遇到了一个与多元宇宙中任何其他生物都不同的生物：一面闪烁的镜子在星海中翻滚，朝向某个未知的目的地，其表面有一个看客的扭曲的反射。起初，我担心它是某种容器。现在我相信观察者是镜子里的囚犯。",
	"As the flickering mirror approached me, I grew fearful. Would it imprison me as well? Luckily, it didn't. As it hovered next to me, I felt a curious tingling sensation. When I tried to touch it, the mirror withdrew slightly, as though it feared some harm might befall it or me. I remember casting a spell or two, hoping to communicate with the creature. A few seconds later, it stopped flickering and flew away. I think it feeds on magical energy.": "当闪烁的镜子向我走来时，我变得很害怕。它是否也会囚禁我？幸运的是，它没有。当它在我身边盘旋时，我感到一种奇怪的刺痛感。当我试图触摸它时，镜子略微后退，似乎它担心一些伤害会降临到它或我身上。我记得我施了一两个咒语，希望能与这个生物沟通。几秒钟后，它停止了闪烁，飞走了。我认为它以魔法能量为食。",
	"This entity has piqued my curiosity. I must learn more. To the library at Starhold!": "这个实体激起了我的好奇心。我必须了解更多。去Starhold的图书馆!",
	"A fractine is a bizarre, two-dimensional creature that flies through Wildspace and the Astral Sea, folding and refolding like a piece of origami. When it encounters another creature, it flattens into a plane that resembles a trapezoidal mirror between 9 and 13 feet tall.": "分形虫是一种奇怪的二维生物，它在荒野空间和星海中飞行，像折纸一样折叠和再折叠。当它遇到另一种生物时，它就会变成一个平面，类似于9到13英尺高的梯形镜子。",
	"Astral explorers who have encountered fractines attest that the creatures are intelligent and often allow themselves to be used as scrying sensors, their reflective surfaces substituting for the mirror needed to cast certain divination spells. While being used in this way, the fractine siphons magical energy from the spellcaster—not enough to cause harm, but enough to make the caster take notice.": "遇到过分光镜的星际探险家证实，这种生物很聪明，经常允许自己被用作探查传感器，它们的反射面可以代替施展某些占卜法术所需的镜子。在以这种方式使用时，分形怪会从施法者身上吸走魔法能量，虽然不足以造成伤害，但足以让施法者注意到。",
	"A fractine needs light and magical energy to survive. It can draw sustenance from a nearby light source, spellcaster, magic item, or magical effect without causing harm to anyone or anything. A fractine that doesn't consume light or magical energy for ten days begins to flicker. A day later, it folds in on itself and self-destructs, leaving no trace of itself behind. The destruction of a fractine is accompanied by a loud sound reminiscent of shattering glass.": "分形兽需要光和魔法能量来生存。它可以从附近的光源、施法者、魔法物品或魔法效果中吸取养分，而不会对人或物造成伤害。一个十天不消耗光或魔法能量的分身开始闪烁。一天后，它就会自我折叠并自我毁灭，不留下任何痕迹。分形体的毁灭伴随着一个巨大的声音，让人联想到玻璃的碎裂。",
	"A fractine attacks by falling on its targets, dealing damage as it passes through them. A fractine can also imprison a creature inside a demiplane contained within its two-dimensional form, the prisoner's distorted reflection visible in the fractine's glassy surface.": "分形怪的攻击方式是落在目标身上，在穿过目标时造成伤害。分形怪还可以将一个生物囚禁在其二维形态的半平面内，囚犯的扭曲反射可以在分形怪的玻璃表面看到。",
	"Bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, and thunder damage can cause a fractine to break into two smaller fractines, each one autonomous and capable of imprisoning creatures. When a fractine dies, it folds in on itself and disappears, releasing any creature trapped inside it.": "敲击、穿刺、砍击和雷击伤害可以使一个分形体分裂成两个较小的分形体，每个分形体都是独立的，能够禁锢生物。当一个分形体死亡时，它会折向自身并消失，释放任何被困在其中的生物。",
	"Gadabouts are gentle, winged creatures that can be used as personal conveyances for short-distance travel across the airless void of Wildspace. A gadabout wraps its branches around a Humanoid creature, spreads its butterfly wings, and allows its wearer to fly through space in a continuously refreshed air envelope. The gadabout's leaves even provide a nourishing syrup that its wearer can consume in the absence of other food and water. One Humanoid can survive on these leaves for up to sixty days.": "Gadabouts是一种温和的、有翅膀的生物，可以作为个人交通工具，在没有空气的荒野空间中进行短途旅行。一棵Gadabout将它的树枝缠绕在一个人形生物上，展开它的蝴蝶翅膀，让它的佩戴者在一个不断刷新的空气包络中飞行。gadabout的叶子甚至可以提供一种营养的糖浆，它的佩戴者可以在没有其他食物和水的情况下食用。一个人形生物可以靠这些叶子生存长达60天。",
	"Gadabouts require sunlight and water to survive. A healthy specimen can live for 25 years. Although its preferred mode of travel is flight, a gadabout can creep slowly along the ground as well.": "Gadabouts需要阳光和水来生存。一个健康的标本可以活25年。虽然它的首选旅行方式是飞行，但牛虻也可以在地面上慢慢爬行。",
	"Elves are the only Humanoids to date who know how to grow gadabouts. Since gadabouts don't generate seeds, each one is a valuable commodity. Mercane and dohwar merchants who come into possession of a healthy gadabout might sell it for 2,500 gp or more.": "精灵是迄今为止唯一知道如何种植gadabouts的类人生物。由于gadabouts不产生种子，所以每一株都是有价值的商品。Mercane和dohwar商人如果拥有一个健康的gadabout，可能会以2500gp或更高的价格出售。",
	"We found several of the creatures in an astral diamond mine at the edge of Greyspace. The miners wanted us to eliminate them. Our warlock, who was fluent in Deep Speech, managed to convince the bulbous creatures to relocate peacefully. They insisted we take them to a small, misshapen moon that doesn't appear on our charts. A horrible fear grips me. What if they're leading us into a trap?": "我们在灰色空间边缘的一个星际钻石矿中发现了几个生物。矿工们希望我们能消灭它们。我们的术士，能说流利的深层语言，设法说服这些球状生物和平地重新安置。他们坚持要我们把他们带到一个没有出现在我们海图上的小的、形状不对的卫星上。一种可怕的恐惧笼罩着我。如果他们带领我们进入一个陷阱怎么办？",
	"A goon balloon looks like a 5-foot-diameter beach ball with clawed feet. Unblinking eyes on the outer surface of its spherical air sac enable the creature to see in all directions at once. These eyes can produce kaleidoscopic light that tears at the minds of the goon balloon's foes.": "鹅卵石气球看起来像一个直径5英尺的沙滩球，脚上有爪子。它的球形气囊外表面有一双不眨眼的眼睛，使该生物能够同时看到各个方向。这些眼睛可以产生万花筒般的光亮，撕扯着地痞气球的敌人的心灵。",
	"A goon balloon speaks by pumping air through a hidden orifice on its underside. When the goon balloon dies, the air in its sac transforms into a noxious gas that bursts from the corpse, potentially poisoning other creatures nearby.": "一个地痞流氓气球通过其底部的一个隐蔽的孔洞泵送空气来说话。当地痞气球死亡时，其囊中的空气会转化为一种有毒的气体，从尸体上迸发出来，可能会毒害附近的其他生物。",
	"Although they can seem playful and harmless, goon balloons are quite mean-spirited. They like to observe the suffering of other creatures and orchestrate that suffering, given half a chance.": "虽然它们看起来很好玩，也无害，但地痞流氓气球是相当刻薄的。它们喜欢观察其他生物的痛苦，只要有半点机会，就会策划这种痛苦。",
	"Nightmare beasts are enormous quadrupeds that stand 20 feet tall, or 40 feet tall when rearing on their hind legs.": "梦魇兽是巨大的四足动物，身高20英尺，用后腿站立时，身高40英尺。",
	"A nightmare beast's legs end in claws, enabling it to climb well despite its size. Its skin is thick and tough, and its teeth are long and sharp. A pair of long, curved tusks jut from the sides of the beast's mouth, and its large red eyes glow in the dark. The creature smashes through structures and fortifications with ease, and it doesn't hesitate to rend foes with its claws and gore them with its tusks, but its most devastating attack is its magical ability to disintegrate foes with its terrible gaze.": "梦魇兽的腿末端是爪子，尽管它的体型很大，但它能很好地攀爬。它的皮肤厚而坚韧，牙齿长而锋利。一对长而弯曲的獠牙从野兽的嘴边伸出来，它的大红眼睛在黑暗中发光。这种生物可以轻松地击穿结构和防御工事，它毫不犹豫地用爪子撕裂敌人，用獠牙刺穿他们，但它最具破坏性的攻击是它的神奇能力，用它可怕的目光瓦解敌人。",
	"Powerful spellcasters create nightmare beasts to serve as living siege engines. A single beast can lay waste to entire cities and armies.": "强大的施法者创造出噩梦般的野兽，作为活的攻城引擎。一头野兽可以浪费整个城市和军队。",
	"A puppeteer parasite looks like a rubbery amoeba the size of a dinner plate. Its dorsal surface is soft and glossy, while its ventral surface is lined with bony hooks. The parasite uses its hooks to attach to a wall or ceiling until suitable prey passes nearby.": "傀儡寄生虫看起来像一个橡胶阿米巴，只有餐盘大小。它的背面是柔软而有光泽的，而其腹面则有骨质的钩子。这种寄生虫用它的钩子附着在墙壁或天花板上，直到合适的猎物经过附近。",
	"A parasite that comes in physical contact with a Humanoid uses its hooks to latch onto it. The parasite can then drain life energy from that creature or use it as transportation. The parasite can also impose its will on a nearby creature, forcing the creature to comply with its wishes. Puppeteer parasites like to use Humanoid thralls as bodyguards and transports.": "与人形生物有身体接触的寄生虫会用它的钩子拴住它。然后，寄生虫可以从该生物身上吸取生命能量，或将其作为交通工具。寄生虫也可以把它的意志强加给附近的生物，迫使生物服从它的意愿。傀儡寄生虫喜欢使用人形寄生虫作为保镖和运输工具。",
	"Drifting in the Astral Sea are the petrified husks of dead gods, their colossal bodies riddled with natural tunnels and caverns. While exploring the innards of one of these dead gods, githyanki xenomancers found a vast cavern containing scores of winged creatures they had never encountered before. The cavern's denizens used telepathy to question the githyanki interlopers, who promptly suggested an alliance. The winged creatures quickly developed a fondness for the githyanki.": "漂浮在星海中的是死去的神明的石化外壳，他们巨大的身体上布满了天然的隧道和洞穴。在探索这些死去的神之一的内脏时，Githyanki异能者发现了一个巨大的洞穴，里面有数十种他们以前从未遇到过的有翼生物。洞穴里的居民用心灵感应询问Githyanki的入侵者，他们立即建议建立联盟。有翼生物很快就对githyanki产生了好感。",
	"The githyanki refer to the winged creatures as star lancers (\"vah'k'rel\" in the Gith tongue) and came to realize star lancers are reincarnations of the dead god's most ardent worshipers. When a star lancer dies, its soul instantly returns to the Great Cavern that forms the hollow heart of the dead god. There, the soul becomes housed in the body of a new, fully grown star lancer that rises magically from the cavern floor. As long as the dead god and its Great Cavern remain intact, the number of star lancers in the multiverse is finite and never-changing.": "githyanki将有翼生物称为星辰长枪手（吉斯语为 \"vah'k'rel\"），并逐渐认识到星辰长枪手是死去的神最热心的崇拜者的转世。当一个星际长矛手死亡时，它的灵魂会立即回到大洞穴中，形成死去的神的空心。在那里，灵魂被安置在一个新的、完全成长的星辰使者的身体里，并神奇地从洞穴地板上升起。只要死去的神和它的大洞穴保持完好，多元宇宙中的星际长矛手的数量就是有限的，而且永不改变。",
	"A star lancer resembles a shark, albeit one that has four wings and a long tail. Its head bears a sharp protuberance that the creature uses to impale enemies.": "星际战士类似于鲨鱼，尽管它有四个翅膀和一条长尾巴。它的头部有一个尖锐的突起，这种生物用它来刺杀敌人。",
	"Githyanki are fond of using star lancers as mounts, riding them across the Astral Sea in small flocks. A star lancer has the innate ability to turn itself and its rider invisible, making it ideal for stealth missions and ambushes.": "吉特亚克人喜欢使用星际长矛手作为坐骑，骑着它们在星海中小范围地穿梭。星际长枪手具有将自己和骑手隐形的先天能力，使其成为隐蔽任务和伏击的理想选择。",
	"Thought to be cast-off splinters of Yggdrasil, the World Tree, yggdrasti look like gigantic, dead trees covered with barnacles. They fly through Wildspace and the Astral Sea with their topmost branches leading the way and their withered roots trailing behind them. Each one has its own gravity plane and air envelope.": "Yggdrasti被认为是世界之树Yggdrasil的废弃碎片，它看起来像巨大的、覆盖着藤壶的死树。它们在荒野空间和星海中飞行，最顶端的树枝在前面带路，枯萎的树根在后面拖着。每个人都有自己的重力平面和空气包络层。",
	"Creatures sometimes try to hitch a ride on an yggdrasti to take advantage of its air envelope. A typical yggdrasti specimen has cavities inside its trunk in which Medium or smaller creatures can lurk.": "生物有时会试图搭上yggdrasti的便车，以利用其空气包络。一个典型的yggdrasti标本在其躯干内有一些空洞，中型或小型生物可以潜伏在里面。",
	"Yggdrasti attack any settlements or spelljamming ships they come across without provocation. By using a speak with plants spell or similar magic, someone might be able to convince an yggdrasti to break off its attack, but the monster's innate hatred of other living things is extremely difficult for it to suppress.": "Yggdrasti会在没有挑衅的情况下攻击它们遇到的任何定居点或法术干扰船。通过使用与植物对话的咒语或类似的魔法，有人可能会说服Yggdrasti停止攻击，但这种怪物对其他生物的天生仇恨是极难抑制的。",
	"Yggdrasti sometimes make landfall and disguise themselves as ordinary trees, burying their roots in the ground to pull off the deception. They can uproot themselves at any time and use their roots to shamble awkwardly across the ground, but flying is their preferred mode of travel.": "Yggdrasti有时会登陆，并将自己伪装成普通的树木，将根部埋在地下以达到欺骗的目的。他们可以在任何时候将自己连根拔起，用自己的树根在地面上笨拙地晃动，但飞行是他们首选的旅行方式。",
