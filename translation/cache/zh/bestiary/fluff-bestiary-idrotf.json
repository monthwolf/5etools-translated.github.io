	"In her first form, Auril appears as a hunched, 7-foot-tall biped with the head of a snowy owl, black talons, cloven hooves, and grayish-white wolf fur covering her body from the neck down. Protruding from her feathery owl's head is a pair of curved goat horns. A cloak and cowl made of pristine white snow conceals much of her tripartite form, which her worshipers refer to as the Cold Crone. This cloak can transform into a pair of owl's wings when Auril sees fit.": "在她的第一形态中，欧瑞尔出现在一个驼背的、7英尺高的双足动物身上，她有一个雪白的猫头鹰的头，黑色的爪子，蹄子，灰白色的狼毛从脖子以下覆盖她的身体。从她那羽翼丰满的猫头鹰头上伸出来的是一对弯曲的山羊角。一件由纯白的雪制成的斗篷和罩子掩盖了她三方的大部分形态，她的崇拜者称其为冷酷的老妪。当奥里尔认为合适时，这件斗篷可以转化为一对猫头鹰的翅膀。",
	"Auril's second form, known to her worshipers as Lady Icekiss or the Brittle Maiden, is that of a 10-foot-tall woman of fearsome aspect made entirely of ice and frost. Her eyes burn with a cold blue light, and a thin cloak of mist forms around her. Blades of ice grow out of her body at odd angles, breaking off before they get too long. When she moves, her body crackles.": "欧里尔的第二种形态，被她的崇拜者称为 \"Icekiss女士 \"或 \"脆皮少女\"，是一个10英尺高的女人，她的可怕之处完全由冰和霜构成。她的眼睛燃烧着冰冷的蓝光，周围形成薄薄的雾状斗篷。冰刃从她的身体里以奇怪的角度生长出来，在它们变得太长之前就会断掉。当她移动时，她的身体发出噼啪声。",

	"Auril's third form, called Winter's Womb or the Queen of Frozen Tears by her most ardent followers, is a 3-foot-diameter ice diamond containing the god's divine spark. The diamond has facets and a sharp point at the bottom. It hovers in the air, radiating intense cold all around it. When Auril speaks, her voice seems to emanate from the heart of the diamond.": "奥里尔的第三种形态，被她最热心的追随者称为 \"冬之子 \"或 \"冻泪女王\"，是一颗直径3英尺的冰钻，含有神的神性火花。这颗钻石有切面，底部有一个尖角。它在空中盘旋，向四周放射出强烈的寒气。当奥里尔说话时，她的声音似乎是从钻石的中心发出来的。",

Umberlee, queen of the wrathful sea, grew to despise the enduring nature of the ice and snow Auril created.

Avarice didn't know who or what the Black Sword was until she was approached by cultists of Levistus bearing swordlike shards of chardalyn worn as pendants around their necks. These self-styled Knights of the Black Sword offered her sanctuary in the keep of Caer-Dineval, where they are based.
