They blunder through hills and forests devouring what they can,bullying smaller creatures into feeding them. Their laziness and dullness would long ago have spelled their end if not for their formidable size and strength.": "山地巨人是自私的、愚蠢的畜生，他们不断地狩猎、觅食和袭击，寻找食物。他们在山丘和森林中游荡，吞噬他们能够吞噬的东西，欺负较小的生物来喂他们。如果不是因为他们强大的体型和力量，他们的懒惰和迟钝早就注定了他们的结局。",
	"Hill giants dwell in hills and mountain valleys across the world, congregating in steadings built of rough timber or in clusters of well-defended mud.and-wattle huts. Their skins are tan from lives spent lumbering up and down the hilly slopes and dozing beneath the sun. Their weapons are uprooted trees and rocks pulled from the earth. The sweat of their bodies adds to the reek of the crude animal skins they wear, poorly stitched together with hair and leather thongs.": "山地巨人居住在世界各地的山丘和山谷中，聚集在用粗糙的木材建造的棚屋中，或聚集在防御严密的泥瓦房中。他们的皮肤被晒得黝黑，因为他们一生都在山坡上伐木，在太阳下打瞌睡。他们的武器是连根拔起的树木和从地里挖出的石头。他们身上的汗水使他们身上的粗糙兽皮更加臭气熏天，这些兽皮是用头发和皮筋拙劣地缝合在一起的。",
	"In a hill giant's world, humanoids and animals are easy prey that can be hunted with impunity. Creatures such as dragons and other giants are tough adversaries. Hill giants equate size with power.": "在山地巨人的世界里，人类和动物是容易被猎杀的猎物，可以肆无忌惮地猎杀。像龙和其他巨人这样的生物则是强悍的对手。山地巨人将大小与力量等同起来。",
	"Hill giants don't realize they follow an ordning. They know only that other giants are larger and stronger than they are, which means they are to be obeyed. A hill giant tribe's chief is usually the tallest and fattest giant that can still move about. Only on rare occasion does a hill giant with more brains than bulk use its cunning to gain the favor of giants of higher status, cleverly subverting the social order.": "山地巨人们并没有意识到他们遵循的是一条法令。他们只知道其他巨人比他们大，比他们强，这意味着他们要服从命令。一个山地巨人部落的首领通常是最高、最胖、还能走动的巨人。只有在极少数情况下，一个头脑比体积大的山地巨人才会利用自己的狡猾来获得地位更高的巨人的青睐，巧妙地颠覆社会秩序。",
	"With nothing else to occupy them, hill giants eat as often as possible. A hill giant hunts and forages alone or with a dire wolf companion, so as to not have to share with other tribe members. The giant eats anything that isn't obviously deadly, such as creatures known to be poisonous. Rotten meat is fair game, though, as are decaying plants and even mud.": "由于没有其他东西可以占据他们，山地巨人尽可能多地进食。山地巨人独自狩猎和觅食，或与地狼同伴一起，这样就不必与其他部落成员分享。巨人吃任何不明显致命的东西，如已知有毒的生物。不过，腐烂的肉是公平的，腐烂的植物甚至是泥土也是如此。",
	"Farmers fear and loathe hill giants. Where a predator such as an ankheg might burrow through fields and consume a cow or two before being driven off, a hill giant will consume a whole herd of cattle before moving on to sheep, goats, and chickens, then tearing into fruits, vegetables, and grain. If a farm family is at hand, the giant might snack on them too.": "农民们害怕和厌恶山地巨人。像安克希格这样的食肉动物可能会钻过田地，吃掉一两头牛就被赶走，而山地巨人会吃掉一整群牛，然后再吃掉绵羊、山羊和鸡，然后再撕咬水果、蔬菜和谷物。如果有一个农场家庭在附近，巨人可能也会把他们吃掉。",

	"With no culture of their own, hill giants ape the traditions of creatures they manage to observe for a time before eating them. They don't think about their own size and strength, however. Tribes of hill giants attempting to imitate elves have been known to topple entire forests by trying to live in trees. Others attempting to take over humanoid towns or villages get only as far as the doors and windows of a building, taking out its walls and roof as they attempt to enter.": "由于没有自己的文化，山地巨人模仿他们设法观察了一段时间的生物的传统，然后再吃掉它们。然而，他们并不考虑自己的体型和力量。试图模仿精灵的山地巨人部落已经知道，他们试图住在树上而推翻了整个森林。还有一些试图占领人形城镇或村庄的巨人，在试图进入建筑物时，只走到建筑物的门和窗前，就把墙壁和屋顶拆了。",

	"Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the giants' heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race's glorious dawn are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval wyrms.Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area without a fight.": "巨人几乎和龙一样古老，当巨人沉重的脚步第一次撼动世界的地基时，龙还很年轻。当他们在新的土地上传播时，巨人和龙进行了痛苦的代际战争，几乎使双方都倒下。没有一个活着的巨人记得是什么引发了冲突，但他们种族辉煌的黎明的神话和故事仍然在他们的城堡和堡垒中传唱，诋毁原始的巫妖。巨人和龙继续对彼此怀恨在心，他们很少会在没有战斗的情况下相遇或占据同一地区。",
	"Each of the main giant races-the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and storm giants-are related by common elements of history, religion, and culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.": "每个主要的巨人种族--云、火、霜、山、石和风暴巨人--都因历史、宗教和文化的共同因素而相关。他们把彼此视为亲属，把任何固有的对领土和野心的敌意降到最低。",
	"Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the purpose of their lives.": "巨人属于一个种姓结构，称为 \"Ordning\"。基于社会等级和高度的组织性，\"秩序 \"为每个巨人分配了一个社会等级。通过了解自己在秩序中的地位，巨人知道哪些其他的巨人比它低等或优越，因为没有两个巨人是平等的。每个巨人种族都会分析不同的技能或品质组合来确定等级。巨人把擅长这些品质作为他们生活的目的。",
	"At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.": "在最高级别的军团中，巨人的种族也是按照地位来排列的。风暴巨人在军团中地位最高，其次是云巨人、火巨人、霜巨人、石巨人、山丘巨人，最后是巨人的亲属，如福摩瑞人、埃廷斯和食人魔。",
	"Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.": "无论一个巨人在其自身种族中的等级如何，山地巨人部落的首领都不如最普通的石巨人。任何类型的最低等级的巨人都要优于劣等类型的最高等级的巨人。不尊重甚至背叛另一种类型的巨人并不被认为是邪恶的，只是粗鲁而已。",
	"When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants, forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon either again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly villains that make up the giants' pantheon.": "当巨人的古老帝国衰落时，所有巨人的父亲安南抛弃了他的孩子和这个世界。他发誓再也不看这两样东西了，直到巨人恢复了他们的荣耀，重新获得他们与生俱来的世界统治者的权利。因此，巨人不是向安纳姆祈祷，而是向他神圣的孩子们祈祷，同时还有一大批英雄神灵和神圣的恶棍，构成了巨人的万神殿。",
	"Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose sons represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden; Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster.": "这些神灵中最主要的是安南的子孙，他们的儿子代表每一种类型的巨人。斯特朗莫斯（Stronmaus）代表风暴巨人，梅姆诺（Memnor）代表云雾巨人，斯科雷欧斯（Skoraeus）代表石骨巨人，特林（Thrym）代表冰霜巨人，苏尔图尔（Surtur）代表火巨人，戈兰托（Grolantor）代表山丘巨人。然而，并不是所有的巨人都会自动崇敬他们种族的主要神灵。许多善良的云系巨人拒绝崇拜狡诈的梅姆诺尔，而居住在北方冰山的风暴巨人可能会对特里姆而不是斯特龙马斯表示敬意。其他巨人觉得与安南的女儿们有更强的联系，她们包括女猎手和家庭监护人希提亚（Hiatea）、爱与和平女神伊拉尼斯（Iallanis）以及急躁和傲慢的骗子戴安娜（Diancastra）。",
	"Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults, paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie. To worship them or any other non-giant deity is a great sin against the ordning, and almost certain to make a giant an outcast.": "一些巨人放弃了他们自己的神灵，成为恶魔崇拜的牺牲品，向巴弗梅特或科斯特奇致敬。崇拜他们或任何其他非巨人的神灵都是对教规的大罪，几乎可以肯定会使巨人成为被抛弃的人。",
	"Cloud giants live extravagant lives high above the world, showing little concern for the plights of other races except as amusement. They are muscular with light skin and have hair of silver or blue.": "云巨人在世界的高处过着奢侈的生活，对其他种族的困境很少关心，除了作为娱乐。他们肌肉发达，皮肤光亮，拥有银色或蓝色的头发。",
	"Cloud giants are spread to the winds, encompassing vast areas of the world. In times of need, scattered cloud giant families band together as a unified clan. However, they can seldom do so quickly.": "云巨人散布在风中，涵盖了世界的广大地区。在需要的时候，分散的云巨人家族会团结起来，成为一个统一的部族。然而，他们很少能迅速做到这一点。",
	"Attuned to the magic of their airy domains, cloud giants are able to turn into mist and create clouds of billowing fog. They dwell in castles on high mountain peaks, or on the solid clouds that once held their fiefs.": "适应了他们空中领域的魔法，云雾巨人能够变成雾，并创造出波涛汹涌的云雾。他们居住在高高的山峰上的城堡里，或者居住在曾经拥有他们领地的坚实的云层上。",
	"Still gracing the skies on occasion, these magic clouds are a lasting remnant of the giants' lost empires. Better spellcasters than most other giants, some cloud giants can control weather, bring storms, and steer the wind almost as well as their cousins, the storm giants.": "这些神奇的云彩偶尔还会出现在天空中，它们是巨人失落的帝国的一个持久的遗留物。比大多数其他巨人更好的施法者，一些云巨人可以控制天气，带来风暴，并引导风向，几乎和他们的表亲，风暴巨人一样好。",
	"Although cloud giants are lower in the ordning than storm giants, the reclusive storm giants rarely engage with the rest of giantkind. As a result, many cloud giants see themselves as having the highest status and power among the giant races.": "虽然云巨人的地位比风暴巨人低，但隐居的风暴巨人很少与其他巨人族接触。因此，许多云巨人认为自己在巨人种族中拥有最高的地位和权力。",
	"They order lesser giants to seek out wealth and art on their behalf, employing fire giants as smiths and crafters, and using frost giants as reavers, raiders, and plunderers. Dimwitted hill giants serve them as brutes and combat fodder-sometimes fighting for the cloud giants' amusement. A cloud giant might order hill or frost giants to steal from nearby humanoid lands, which it considers to be a fair tax for its continued beneficence. On their mountain summits and solid clouds, cloud giants keep extraordinary gardens. Grapes as big as apples grow there, along with apples the size of pumpkins, and pumpkins the size of wagons. From the errant seeds of these gardens, tales of cottagesized produce and magic beans are spread in the mortal realm.": "他们命令较小的巨人代表他们寻找财富和艺术，雇用火巨人作为铁匠和工匠，利用冰霜巨人作为掠夺者、袭击者和掠夺者。愚蠢的山地巨人为他们服务，充当野蛮人和战斗的炮灰--有时为云巨人的娱乐而战斗。云雾巨人可能会命令山丘巨人或冰霜巨人从附近的人形土地上偷东西，它认为这是对它的持续恩惠的公平税收。在他们的山顶和坚实的云层上，云巨人保持着非凡的花园。那里生长着像苹果一样大的葡萄，还有像南瓜一样大的苹果，以及像马车一样大的南瓜。从这些花园的错误种子中，关于山寨产品和魔豆的故事在凡间传播。",
	"As humanoid nobles keep an aerie for hunting hawks, so do cloud giants keep griffons, perytons, and wyverns as their own flying beasts of prey. Such creatures also patrol the cloud giants' gardens by night, along with trained predators such as owlbears and lions.": "就像人形贵族为狩猎鹰保留了一个小房间一样，云巨人也保留了狮鹫、perytons和狼獾作为他们自己的飞行猎物。这些生物也会在夜间巡逻云巨人的花园，同时还有训练有素的捕食者，如猫头鹰和狮子。",
	"The patron god and father of the cloud giants is Memnor the Trickster, the cleverest and slyest of the giant deities. Cloud giants align themselves according to the aspects and exploits of Memnor that they most admire, with evil cloud giants emulating his deceitfulness and self-interest and good cloud giants emulating his intellect and silvertongued speech. Family members usually align in the same direction.": "云雾巨人的守护神和父亲是诡计多端的梅姆诺，他是最聪明、最狡猾的巨人神。云巨人根据他们最崇拜的梅姆诺的方面和功绩来结盟，邪恶的云巨人模仿他的欺骗和自我利益，善良的云巨人则模仿他的智慧和银舌的言论。家庭成员通常向同一方向看齐。",
	"A cloud giant earns its place in the ordning by the treasure it accumulates, the wealth it wears, and the gifts it bestows on other cloud giants.": "一个云端巨人通过其积累的宝藏、佩戴的财富和给予其他云端巨人的礼物来赢得其在条例中的地位。",
	"However, value is only one part of the assessment. The extravagances a cloud giant wears or places about its home must also be beautiful or wondrous. Sacks of gold or gems are worth less to a cloud giant than the jewelry that might be crafted from those materials, creating treasures that bring esteem to a cloud giant's household.": "然而，价值只是评估的一个部分。云雾巨人所穿戴的或摆放在家中的奢侈物品也必须是美丽或奇妙的。对云巨人来说，一袋金子或宝石的价值不如用这些材料制作的珠宝，创造的宝物能给云巨人的家庭带来尊贵。",
	"Rather than steal from one another or fight over treasures, cloud giants are inveterate gamblers with a hunger for high risks and high rewards. They frequently bet on the outcome of events nominally outside their control, such as the lives of lesser creatures. Ordning ranks and kings' ransoms can be won and lost in bets over the military triumphs of humanoid nations. Fixing wagers by interfering in the conflict causes the loss of the bet, but such deceit is considered to be cheating only if it is discovered. Otherwise, it is cleverness honoring Memnor.": "与其互相偷窃或争夺宝物，云巨人是不折不扣的赌徒，渴望高风险和高回报。他们经常在名义上不受他们控制的事件的结果上下注，例如较小的生物的生命。在对人形国家的军事胜利的赌注中，可以赢得或输掉军衔和国王的赎金。通过干涉冲突来固定赌注会导致赌注的损失，但这种欺骗只有在被发现时才被认为是作弊。否则，它就是尊重Memnor的聪明才智。",
	"Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked beneath the giants' feet. In those lost days, these towering figures were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain thecustoms and traditions of old.": "古老的帝国曾经给一个在巨人脚下颤抖的世界投下漫长的阴影。在那些失落的日子里，这些高大的人物是屠龙者、梦想家、手工艺人和国王，但他们的种类很久以前就从荣耀中消失了。然而，即使分散在世界各地的隐秘部族中，巨人仍保持着古老的习俗和传统。",
	"The creature referred to in Northlander lore as the Hunter of Men is a sure-footed predator that can be found anywhere except deep forest, preferring ledges and cliffs in the mountains. Its cry resembles a human scream of terror. It often elicits such sounds from its victims, for it prefers human flesh to all other prey.": "在北地人的传说中，这种生物被称为人类的猎人，是一种脚步稳健的捕食者，除了深山老林外，在任何地方都能找到，它更喜欢山区的壁架和悬崖。它的叫声类似于人类的恐怖叫声。它经常从受害者身上发出这样的声音，因为它更喜欢人肉而不是其他猎物。",
	"Crag cats blend in with natural surroundings. During the winter, their fur turns white to blend in with the snow. At other times of the year, their fur is gray, enabling them to hide among the rocks more easily.": "峭壁猫与自然环境融为一体。在冬季，它们的毛发会变成白色，以便与雪融为一体。在一年中的其他时间，它们的皮毛是灰色的，使它们能够更容易地隐藏在岩石中。",
	"The crag cat knows its territory and often attacks when its prey is asleep, exhausted, or otherwise weakened. Although crag cats are typically solitary, they can be found in family groups of two parents and {@dice 1d4} Small noncombatant cubs in the spring, or in hungry packs in severe winter weather.": "峭壁猫了解自己的领地，经常在猎物睡着、精疲力竭或其他情况下被削弱时发动攻击。虽然峭壁猫通常是独居的，但在春天，它们可以在由两只父母和{@dice 1d4}小的非战斗性幼崽组成的家庭群中被发现，或者在严冬的天气中以饥饿的群组出现。",

	"Fire giant fortresses are built around and inside volcanoes or near magma-filled caverns. The blistering heat of their homes fuels the fire giants' forges, and causes the iron of their fortress walls to glow a comforting orange. In lands far removed from volcanic heat, fire giants mine coal to burn. Traditional smithies occupy places of honor in their demesnes, and the giants' stony fortresses constantly belch plumes of sooty smoke. In more remote outposts, fire giants burn wood to keep their forge fires lit, deforesting leagues of land in all directions.": "火巨人的堡垒建在火山周围和内部，或者靠近充满岩浆的洞穴。他们的家园所散发的热浪为火巨人的锻造提供了燃料，并使他们的堡垒墙体发出令人欣慰的橙色光芒。在远离火山热的地方，火巨人开采煤炭来燃烧。传统的铁匠铺在他们的领地里占据着荣誉的位置，而巨人的石质堡垒则不断地喷出烟尘的烟雾。在更偏远的前哨站，火巨人燃烧木材以保持他们的锻造火种，在各个方向上砍伐森林的土地。",

They can adapt to cold environments with effort, though, keeping their hearth fires burning bright and wearing heavy woolen clothing and furs to stay warm.": "火巨人回避寒冷，就像他们的表亲冰霜巨人讨厌热一样。不过他们可以努力适应寒冷的环境，保持炉火熊熊燃烧，穿上厚厚的羊毛衣服和毛皮以保持温暖。",
	"From birth, a fire giant is taught to embrace a legacy of war. At the cradle, its parents chant songs of battle. As children, fire giants play at war, hurling igneous rocks at one another across the banks of magma rivers. In later years, formal martial training becomes an integral part of life in the giants' fortresses and underground realms of smoke and ash.": "火巨人从出生起就被教导要接受战争的遗产。在摇篮里，它的父母高唱战斗之歌。在儿童时期，火巨人在战争中玩耍，在岩浆河两岸互相投掷火岩。到了晚年，正式的武术训练成为巨人的堡垒和地下烟尘领域生活的一个组成部分。",
	"The fire giants' songs are odes of battles lost and won, while their dances are martial formations of pounding feet that resound like smiths' hammers throughout theirsmoky halls.": "火巨人的歌曲是关于战斗失败和胜利的颂歌，而他们的舞蹈则是敲击脚步的武术队形，像铁匠的锤子一样响彻他们潮湿的殿堂。",
	"Just as fire giants pass down their knowledge of crafting from generation to generation, their renowned fighting prowess comes not from wild fury but from endless discipline and training. Enemies make the mistake of underestimating fire giants based on their brutish manner, learning too late that these giants live for combat and can be shrewd tacticians.": "就像火巨人代代相传的工艺知识一样，他们著名的战斗力不是来自于狂暴的愤怒，而是来自于无尽的纪律和训练。敌人会因为火巨人的野蛮行为而错误地低估他们，但他们很晚才知道，这些巨人是为战斗而生的，可以成为精明的战术家。",

	"Fire giants low in the ordning manage the mine tunnels and the slaves that toil there, few of which survive the difficult and dangerous work for long.

	"Inns and taverns suffer the brunt of the damage, their cellars gutted and their casks of ale and mead gone. Smithies are likewise toppled, their iron and steel claimed. Curiously undisturbed are the houses of moneylenders and wealthy citizens, for the reavers have little use for coins or baubles.

	"When frost giants of different clans meet and their status is unclear, they wrestle for dominance.

	"Though frost giants consider the menial crafting of goods beneath them, carving and leatherwork are valued skills. They make their clothing from the skins and bones of beasts, and carve bone or ivory into jewelry and the handles of weapons and tools. They reuse the weapons and armor of their smaller foes, stringing shields into scale armor and lashing sword blades to wooden hafts to make giant-sized spears.

	"Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.": "虽然它们有时会吃仙人掌和其他沙漠植物来满足它们巨大的饥饿感，但蓝龙是食肉动物。它们更喜欢吃群居动物，在大快朵颐之前用它们的闪电气息烹饪这些生物。它们的饮食习惯使蓝龙成为沙漠商队和游牧部落的巨大威胁，在龙的眼里，这些商队和部落都是方便的食物和财宝的集合体。",
	"When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone.

Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewelery and magic items adorned with those gems.": "虽然蓝龙收集任何看起来有价值的东西，但他们特别喜欢宝石。他们认为蓝色是最高贵和最美丽的颜色，他们觊觎蓝宝石，喜欢用这些宝石装饰的珠宝和魔法物品。",

When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview.

Storm giant parents stay together to raise a child to maturity, then return to the solitary isolation they cherish.": "风暴巨兽不经常与其他同类交流。他们这样做通常是为了比较征兆和预兆，或者进行罕见的求爱。风暴巨兽的父母呆在一起，将孩子养育成人，然后回到他们所珍视的孤独的环境中。",
	"Some humanoid cultures worship storm giants as they would worship lesser gods, creating myths and stories around the giants' exploits and vast knowledge. A storm giant is governed by the dictates of its conscience, however, and not by any culture's laws or codes of honor. As such, a storm giant that bends its mind toward greed or gains a taste for petty power can easily become a terrible threat.": "一些人形文化对风暴巨人的崇拜就像他们对小神的崇拜一样，围绕着巨人的功绩和丰富的知识创造神话和故事。然而，风暴巨人受其良知的支配，而不是受任何文化的法律或荣誉准则的支配。因此，风暴巨人如果贪婪成性，或者对小权力有兴趣，很容易成为一个可怕的威胁。",
	"The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures. The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.": "红龙是最贪婪的真龙，他们不知疲倦地寻求增加他们的宝藏。即使对于龙来说，它们也是非常虚荣的，它们的自负反映在它们骄傲的姿态和对其他生物的蔑视上。硫磺和浮石的气味围绕着红龙，它的后掠角和脊柱的褶皱决定了它的轮廓。它有喙的鼻子随时都会喷出烟雾，愤怒时眼睛会跳出火焰。它的翅膀是所有色龙中最长的，沿着尾部边缘有一种蓝黑色的色调，就像被火烧成蓝色的金属。",

	"No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.": "没有其他龙能接近红龙的傲慢。这些生物视自己为国王和帝王，并视其他龙族为低等生物。红龙相信他们是被提亚马特选中，以她的名义进行统治，认为世界和其中的每一个生物都是他们可以指挥的。",

They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.": "红龙是激烈的领地主义和孤立主义。然而，它们渴望了解更广阔世界的事件，并利用较小的生物作为线人、信使和间谍。它们对其他红龙的消息最感兴趣，因为它们不断地与其他红龙争夺地位。",
	"When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.": "当它需要仆人时，红龙要求混乱的邪恶人类效忠。如果不效忠，它就会屠杀一个部落的首领，并要求对幸存者拥有领主地位。为红龙服务的生物一直生活在恐惧之中，害怕因为不高兴而被烤焦和吃掉。他们大部分时间都在向红龙献媚，试图保住性命。",

	"In their seemingly idyllic hideaways, the yakfolk rule with iron fists, and for all their learning and culture, they are enormously evil overlords.
