	"A pterosaur the size of the most ancient dragons, an aerosaur boasts a wingspan of nearly 200 feet. Elemental energy traces patterns like lightning across its scales, giving additional thunderous power to the beating of its enormous wings.": "一只与最古老的龙相当大小的翼龙，一只空气龙拥有近200英尺的翼展。元素能量在它的鳞片上形成闪电般的图案，为它巨大的翅膀拍打增添了雷鸣般的力量。",
	"The altisaur is a titanic sauropod often likened to a walking mountain, with craggy spines, patterns of elemental energy that glow in its hide like streams of lava, and eight massive legs the size of ancient trees. It creates gullies where its tail drags along the ground. Clouds often seem to gather around its head, which can reach as high as 150 feet off the ground.": "这种阿尔提龙(Altisaur)是一种巨大的蜥脚类恐龙，常被比作行走的山脉，身披崎岖的脊刺，身上闪烁着元素能量的图案，如同熔岩流一般，有着八条像古老树干一样粗大的腿。它的尾巴拖在地面上会形成沟壑。云常常似乎围绕在它的头部周围，它的头部能够高达150英尺离地面。",
	"A Dwarvish saga claims bag jellies are the result of a curse laid by Durgrid Bladeforge, who was beaten to death while hiding inside a giant's bag.": "一部矮人传奇声称，袋子果冻是由杜尔格里德·刃熔铸（Durgrid Bladeforge）施放的诅咒造成的，他在一个巨人的袋子里躲藏时被殴打致死。",
	"Bag jellies are olive-hued oozes similar to the dungeon scavengers described in the{@i Monster Manual}. As their name suggests, though, these creatures are most often found in the bags carried by giants, where they feed on whatever organic material they find. Bag jellies are resistant to squishing, which helps them survive when a giant throws the bag, sits on it, or uses it as a makeshift bludgeon.": "袋凝胶是橄榄色的软泥怪，类似于{@i Monster Manual}中描述的地牢清道夫。正如它们的名字所暗示的，这些生物通常出现在巨人携带的袋子中，它们会吞食袋子里找到的任何有机物质。袋凝胶对挤压有抵抗力，这有助于它们在巨人扔袋子、坐在上面或将其用作临时的重击武器时生存下来。",
	"Some giants keep their bags scrupulously clean to avoid attracting bag jellies, but others actually use these scavengers to hinder thieves. Many would-be thieves who rummage through a sleeping giant's bag find themselves stuck to a bag jelly's adhesive surface and unable to flee as the sound of their struggle wakes the giant.": "一些巨人会非常注意保持他们的袋子干净，以避免吸引袋子水母，但也有一些巨人实际上会利用这些清道夫来阻止小偷。许多企图偷窃的小偷在翻找睡着巨人的包裹时，发现自己被粘在袋子水母的粘性表面上，无法逃脱，而他们挣扎的声音会唤醒巨人。",
	"I'm not one to discount Dwarvish sagas as a rule, but everyone knows that food left in a bag too long sometimes comes alive. \"Eat it before it eats you.\" That's my motto.": "我通常不会完全否认矮人的传说，但每个人都知道被放在袋子里太久的食物有时会变得有生命。\"在它吃掉你之前吃掉它。\" 这是我的座右铭。",
	"A hill giant who dies with an empty stomach, full of rage and regret, might become suffused with energy from the Negative Plane and rise as a barrowghast. Though it looks like little more than an animated corpse, a barrowghast is filled with necrotic energy and driven by spite and malice. Its blood is a thick and toxic ichor that gives the barrowghast a noxious stench.": "一个山岭巨人在饥饿、充满愤怒和懊悔的情况下死去，可能会被负能量充斥并升起为一个巴洛戈斯特。尽管它看起来不过是一个被操纵的尸体，但巴洛戈斯特充满了死灵能量，被怨恨和恶意所驱使。它的血液是一种浓稠有毒的粘液，给巴洛戈斯特带来一种恶臭。",
	"Barrowghasts no longer hunger for physical food and instead crave life energy drained from living creatures. They often target former family members and allies, but they feast indiscriminately on any creatures they encounter. When barrowghasts drain Humanoids' life energy, those Humanoids rise as zombies.": "巴罗鬼(Barrowghasts)不再渴望食物，而是渴望从活物身上吸取生命能量。它们经常选择前家人和盟友作为目标，但也会对任何遇到的生物进行无差别的吸取。当巴罗鬼吸取人形生物的生命能量时，这些人形生物会变成僵尸。",
	"Stone giants believe the god Skoraeus Stonebones inspires artists to create their finest stone carvings. Sometimes a giant pursues this divine inspiration to the exclusion of all other tasks, retreating into a spacious cavern and blocking out all distractions. Creating a masterwork can become such a driving obsession that death can't stop it: a giant who dies while creating art might rise as a cairnwight and continue the work. Once the artwork is completed, the cairnwight remains as its undying guardian.": "石巨人相信神斯科雷乌斯·石骨(Skoraeus Stonebones)会激发艺术家创作出他们最精美的石雕作品。有时候，巨人会追求这种神圣的灵感，将所有其他任务排除在外，退入一个宽敞的洞穴，屏蔽一切干扰。创作杰作可以变成一种强烈的执念，即使死亡也无法阻止：一个在创作艺术时死去的巨人可能会以一名石堆亡灵(cairnwight)的形式继续工作。一旦艺术品完成，石堆亡灵将作为它的不朽守护者而存在。",
	"A cairnwight looks much like an emaciated stone giant. Its form is caked with lichens and mineral deposits, which help it blend with its cavern tomb. Should a creature attempt to interfere with the completion of the cairnwight's project, damage the art, or steal from the cairnwight, the giant petrifies the creature, places the resulting statue outside as a warning, then reseals its cavern vault.": "一只石堆巨人看起来很像一只憔悴的石头巨人。它的身体布满苔藓和矿物沉积物，这有助于它与洞穴墓室融为一体。如果有生物试图干扰石堆巨人的项目、损坏艺术品或偷走石堆巨人的东西，这只巨人会让生物石化，将结果的雕像放在外面作为警告，然后重新封闭它的洞穴宝库。",
	"Stretching over 200 feet from the tip of its enormous nose horn to the end of its spiky tail, a ceratops gleams with lines of vibrant green energy in its thickly scaled hide. Its horn alone is larger than most giants, and the ceratops can trample ancient forests under its feet when it becomes enraged.": "一只角龙从其巨大鼻角尖端一直延伸到尖尾，全长超过200英尺，其厚鳞皮上闪耀着绚丽的绿色能量线。它的角单单就比大多数巨人还要大，当它暴怒时，角龙可以踩平古老的森林。",
	"Cinder hulks are distant descendants of fire giants who isolated themselves from the world and steeped themselves in the energy of the Elemental Planes. Over the course of centuries, these giants were transformed into Elementals made of smoke and cinders. Half the size of their giant ancestors, cinder hulks maintain the basic physical shape of fire giants, but ash and embers billow around their barely cohesive physical forms.": "灰渣巨人是火巨人的遥远后裔，他们与世隔绝，沉浸在元素位面的能量中。几个世纪以来，这些巨人被转化为由烟雾和灰烬构成的元素生物。与他们的巨人祖先相比，灰渣巨人只有一半大小，保持了火巨人的基本身形，但灰烬和余烬在他们几乎不稳定的物理形态周围翻腾。",
	"Cinder hulks live in isolated enclaves in fiery locations on the Material Plane, in the Elemental Planes of Air and Fire, and especially in the Great Conflagration, the border region between those two planes. They retain none of the skills and motivation of their giant ancestors; they simply want to burn as much as they can until their own flames are extinguished. When a cinder hulk dies, it collapses into a billowing cloud of searing smoke.": "燃灰巨汉生活在物质位面上火热的偏远风景区，元素位面的空气和火焰之中，尤其是在两个位面之间的边境地区——大燃烧地带。它们没有保留任何巨人祖先的技能和动机；它们只是想要燃烧尽可能多的东西，直到它们自己的火焰熄灭。当一只燃灰巨汉死去时，它会倒下，化为一团滚滚的灼热烟雾。",
	"Cloud giants rise in the ordning by amassing valuable and beautiful treasures—often by gambling. While many cloud giants are content with risking their wealth in games with each other, those who aim for the top of their ordning challenge all manner of beings in games of chance and wit. A destiny gambler is a cloud giant who has won increasingly high-stakes wagers against other giants, smaller folk, and even beings from the Outer Planes.": "云巨人通过积累有价值和美丽的财宝来在（ordning）中崛起——通常是通过赌博。虽然许多云巨人乐于在彼此之间的游戏中冒险他们的财富，但那些瞄准（ordning）顶端的人会挑战各种生物，进行机智和运气的游戏。命运赌徒是一种云巨人，他在与其他巨人、小人物甚至外部位面的生物之间赢得了越来越高赌注的赌局。",

	"Years of successful wagers make destiny gamblers so confident in their ability to win any challenge that they invite potential rivals to name the terms of a wager. Those who are foolish enough to issue a combat challenge quickly find these giants' magical prowess is nearly unmatched.": "多年来成功的赌注使命运赌徒们对自己赢得任何挑战的能力充满信心，以至于他们邀请潜在的对手来规定赌注的条件。那些愚蠢到发起战斗挑战的人很快就会发现这些巨人的魔法能力几乎是无与伦比的。",
	"Given their inherent link to elemental air, cloud giants who turn from the gods of the Ordning often gravitate to the service of Yan-C-Bin, Prince of Evil Air. These giants' cunning, charisma, and sheer physical and magical might make them well suited to leadership positions in the cults of Elemental Evil. A cult with a cloud giant at its head can be a formidable force of corruption and destruction in the world. As if that weren't enough, cloud giants often bring tremendous wealth with them, swelling the cult's coffers to finance more far-reaching operations.": "鉴于他们与元素空气的内在联系，那些背弃等级秩序之神的云巨人往往会转向侍奉邪恶空气之王——燕-西-宾 (Yan-C-Bin)。这些巨人的狡诈、魅力以及强大的身体和魔法力量使他们非常适合在元素邪恶教派中担任领导职务。一个由云巨人领导的教派在世界上可以成为腐化和毁灭的强大力量。更甚的是，云巨人通常会带来巨大的财富，使教派的金库膨胀，以资助更广泛的行动。",
	"A cloud giant dedicated to Evil Air wears a magic vest adorned with wings made from roc feathers and enchanted with elemental air, allowing the giant to fly. The vest functions only for the giant who wears it.": "一个致力于邪恶空气的云巨人穿着一件魔法背心，上面装饰着由火鸟羽毛制成的翅膀，并附有元素风的魔法，使得巨人能够飞行。这件背心只对穿戴它的巨人有效。",
	"A slumbering scion of Memnor appears as a dense, slowly drifting tower of clouds that never dissipates. Often, this cloud lingers over a remote valley, creating a constantly overcast sky. Sapient creatures who live beneath this cloud often display superstitious and duplicitous behavior, almost unconsciously leaving gifts for \"rain spirits\" while playing mischievous pranks on each other.": "一个沉睡中的(Memnor)的后裔呈现为一座稠密、缓慢漂移的云塔，永远不会消散。通常，这片云会盘旋在一个偏远的山谷上空，形成持续多云的天空。生活在这片云下的有智慧生物经常表现出迷信和奸诈的行为，几乎是下意识地给“雨神”留下礼物，同时又在彼此之间玩恶作剧。",
	"When roused, a cradle of the cloud scion manifests as a titanic air elemental made of fierce winds and wisps of cloud. It wields air and thunder to knock enemies from the sky.": "当被唤醒时，云裔摇篮(`cloud scion`)显现为一个巨大的空气元素，由狂风和一缕缕云雾组成。它挥舞着空气和雷电，将敌人从天空中击落。",
	"If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Memnor emerges from the dissipating cloud, often laughing as if it just heard a great joke. Incredibly tall and lanky, the scion towers 75 feet tall and wields a morningstar made from magically dense clouds.": "如果摇篮被摧毁，梅姆诺的子嗣将从消散的云中出现，经常笑得像刚听到一个很好笑的笑话一样。这位身材异常高大瘦削的子嗣高达75英尺，手持由魔法密集云朵制成的晨星。",
	"It tends to regard other creatures as toys rather than serious threats, and it uses its illusion magic to manipulate creatures into fighting each other. If seriously threatened, it wields thunder and wind to demolish its enemies.": "它倾向于将其他生物视为玩具，而不是严重威胁，并利用其幻术来操纵生物互相战斗。如果受到严重威胁，它会运用雷电和风来摧毁敌人。",
	"A scion of Surtur slumbering at the peak of a volcano causes an unending plume of smoke to rise, sometimes lit from below by fiery bursts of lava. As the scion dreams of battle—perhaps a battle to rouse Annam from seclusion by uniting the giants or a war to conquer all in Surtur's name—the volcano rumbles and spews molten rage.": "在火山顶部沉睡的苏尔特的后裔引起了一股不断上升的烟雾，有时从下面点燃，喷发出火山岩浆。当后裔梦见战斗——也许是一场唤醒安南从隐居中团结巨人的战斗，或者是一场以苏尔特之名征服一切的战争时，火山隆隆作响，喷发出熔岩的愤怒。",
	"If intruders disturb its resting place, the fire scion's cradle rises as a bipedal juggernaut of molten rock. Sometimes miners risk their lives to find rich veins of ore in a scion's volcano, or misguided fire cultists offer sacrifices meant to appease or awaken the volcano, and the awakened cradle defies all their expectations. Like a living volcano, the cradle hurls balls of magma at intruders, exhales fiery gases, and causes molten stone to erupt from the ground around it.": "如果入侵者打扰了它的安息之地，火焰之子的摇篮会升起，化身为一只由熔岩构成的双足巨像。有时矿工们冒着生命危险在火焰之子的火山中寻找富含矿脉的矿脉，或者误入歧途的火焰教徒献祭，试图安抚或唤醒火山，而觉醒的摇篮却违背了他们所有的期望。就像一个活生生的火山，摇篮向入侵者投掷岩浆球，喷出火焰气体，并导致周围的地面喷发出熔岩石。",
	"If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Surtur inside it awakens. Standing 60 feet tall, the scion's form is shrouded in a continual cloud of billowing ash and smoke. The awakened scion forms a blade of lava in its mighty hand and schemes to resume its ancient campaigns of conquest, preferably at the head of a fire giant army.": "如果摇篮被摧毁，其中的苏尔特的子嗣会苏醒。身高60英尺，这位子嗣的形态被一团不断涌动的灰尘和烟雾所笼罩。苏醒的子嗣在其强大的手中形成一把熔岩之刃，并计划恢复其古老的征服战役，最好是率领一支火巨人军队。",
	"A slumbering scion of Thrym encased in its cradle is functionally identical to a glacier or iceberg, nestled in an alpine valley or drifting in a polar sea. In its wintry seclusion, the scion dreams of battle and glory.": "一个沉睡中的索姆之子，被封印在它的摇篮中，与冰川或冰山在功能上是相同的，它依偎在高山谷地或漂浮在极地海域中。在寒冷的隐居中，这位之子梦见战斗和荣耀。",
	"If it is disturbed, the scion's cradle animates as a bipedal figure formed of ice and snow. It smashes intruders with its icy fists or hurls shards of its own icy substance at them, and it can exhale a blast of frigid air to freeze foes in place.": "如果受到干扰，(the scion's cradle)会变成一个由冰雪形成的双足生物。它用冰冷的拳头猛击入侵者，或者向他们投掷自己的冰质碎片，还可以呼出一股寒冷的气流，将敌人冻结在原地。",
	"If the cradle is destroyed, its icy body shatters to reveal the awakened scion of Thrym inside it. Forming a double-bladed axe in its hand, the 70-foot-tall scion rushes at any foe that dares to challenge it. Emulating sagas of Thrym, the scion can achieve a tremendous feat of strength: creating a glacier in the ground and hurling it skyward, along with any creatures standing on it.": "如果摇篮被摧毁，它的冰冷身体会破裂，露出其中的Thrym之子。这个身高70英尺的巨人手持双刃斧，冲向任何敢于挑战它的敌人。模仿Thrym的传说，这个巨人可以实现惊人的力量壮举：在地面上创造一个冰川，将其抛向天空，连同站在上面的任何生物一起。",
	"A slumbering scion of Grolantor is often mistaken for a hill, and sometimes people erect standing stones, a village, or a city on a scion's back, unaware of the mighty power beneath them. Such settlements can thrive for centuries, as the scion's magic causes crops to flourish and livestock to thrive in the surrounding region. An ancient tree towers from the crest of the hill.": "一个沉睡中的(Grolantor)的后裔经常被误认为是一座小山，有时人们在后裔的背上竖立石碑、村庄或城市，却不知道他们脚下强大的力量。这样的定居点可以繁荣数个世纪，因为后裔的魔法让周围地区的庄稼茂盛，牲畜蓬勃发展。一棵古老的树高耸在山顶。",
	"When roused, a cradle of the hill scion rises as a mass of dirt, stone, and roots with two massive arms. The cradle uses tree roots and waves of dirt to entangle and entomb foes.": "当被唤醒时，山丘子嗣的摇篮会化为一团泥土、石头和根系构成的巨大物体，拥有两只庞大的臂膀。摇篮利用树根和泥土的波浪来缠绕和埋葬敌人。",
	"If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Grolantor inside it awakens. Standing 50 feet tall, the scion devours everything within reach to satiate its hunger. Its powerful lungs can suck food straight into its gullet. The scion uses a great tree to bat foes far into the distance.": "如果摇篮被摧毁，其中的(Grolantor)的后裔会苏醒。身高50英尺，这位后裔会吞噬周围一切以满足它的饥饿。它强大的肺部可以直接将食物吸入喉咙。这位后裔会利用一棵巨树将敌人击打到远处。",
	"A scion of Skoraeus typically slumbers deep in the heart of a towering mountain, almost becoming one with the earth. While the scion dreams, the mountain's minerals are transformed into fine carving stones and brilliant gems.": "Skoraeus的后裔通常沉睡在高耸的山脉深处，几乎与大地融为一体。当后裔沉睡时，山脉的矿物被转化为精美的雕刻石和闪亮的宝石。",
	"If a miner tunnels too close to the heart of the mountain, the cradle awakens as a bipedal mass of stone and crystals. It brings the weight of the mountain down on the intruder's head and unleashes an earsplitting roar that can collapse mine tunnels.": "如果一名矿工挖掘得太靠近山脉的核心，那么摇篮会苏醒为一个由石头和水晶组成的双足怪物。它会让整座山压在入侵者头上，并发出震耳欲聋的咆哮，足以导致矿井隧道坍塌。",
	"If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Skoraeus inside it awakens. At nearly 70 feet tall, it towers over most other creatures and wields a mass of crystal as a club. Once awakened, the scion continues to pursue the art that ornamented its dreams, seeking to mold and shape stone into beautiful elegance. If it needs more raw materials, the scion can transform a living creature in its palm into stone.": "如果摇篮被摧毁，其中的(`Skoraeus`)之子会苏醒。几乎有70英尺高，它高耸于大多数其他生物之上，手持一团水晶作为棍棒。一旦苏醒，这位之子会继续追求在梦中装饰的艺术，试图将石头塑造成美丽的优雅。如果需要更多原材料，这位之子可以将手掌中的活物转化为石头。",
	"A scion of Stronmaus often slumbers high in the sky or deep in the ocean, where the tumult caused by the scion's restless sleep has little effect on the world. If it drifts too near the ground or the ocean surface, it causes mighty storms or fierce maelstroms. A scion's slumber is filled with dreams ranging from inspiring visions of Annam's return to melancholy prophecies of inevitable decline, from joyful glimpses of an idyllic past to horrific nightmares of torment and devastation.": "一位(`Stronmaus`)的后裔经常在高空或深海中沉睡，后裔不安的睡眠所引起的骚动对世界几乎没有影响。如果它漂浮得太接近地面或海面，就会引发强大的风暴或凶猛的漩涡。一位后裔的沉睡充满了各种梦境，从激励人心的安纳姆(`Annam`)归来的愿景到不可避免衰落的忧郁预言，从对宜人过去的快乐一瞥到折磨和毁灭的可怕噩梦。",
	"A cradle of the storm scion stirs into action not only when the scion is threatened but also if the scion's sleep is troubled by nightmares. When roused, the cradle takes on a vaguely giant-shaped form consisting of air, water, and ice whirling in fury.": "当风暴传人的摇篮受到威胁或者受到噩梦困扰时，它就会被唤醒。一旦被唤醒，摇篮会化为一种模糊的巨人形态，由怒气腾腾的空气、水和冰组成。",
	"If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Stronmaus inside it awakens. Among the mightiest creatures of all giantkind, the scion stands 80 feet tall. It often finds some relief in waking and being freed from its troubling dreams, so it doesn't necessarily lash out in violence when emerging from its cradle. But it's not particularly interested in Humanoids or other little creatures—either in conversing with them or in protecting them from harm it might cause.": "如果摇篮被摧毁，其中的斯特隆莫斯之子会苏醒。作为所有巨人中最强大的生物之一，这位之子身高80英尺。它常常在苏醒并摆脱困扰它的梦境时找到一些宽慰，因此当从摇篮中出现时，它不一定会以暴力相向。但它对人形生物或其他小生物并不特别感兴趣——无论是与它们交谈还是保护它们免受可能造成的伤害。",
	"If the scion is threatened, it unleashes elemental might like few other forces in the multiverse can muster: blades of lightning, boulder-sized hailstones, and a storm of churning elements.": "如果（Scion）受到威胁，它会释放元素之力，如同多元宇宙中少有的力量：闪电之刃、鹅卵石般大小的冰雹，以及翻腾元素的风暴。",
	"Death giant reapers wield massive scythes and wear armor that resembles the carapaces of giant insects. They wield the magic of shadow, which lets them take on a ghastly appearance and disappear, as well as twist shadow into terrifying bolts of energy that drain the vigor of their victims.": "死亡巨人收割者挥舞着巨大的镰刀，穿着类似巨大昆虫甲壳的盔甲。他们操控着暗影的魔法，让他们呈现可怕的外表并消失，同时将暗影扭曲成可怕的能量箭，吸取受害者的活力。",
	"A death giant shrouded one has learned the secrets of death magic—some say from the Raven Queen herself. A shrouded one collects the skulls of fallen kin and inscribes the death rune on a prized skull from this grisly collection. Abandoning armor in favor of gloomy robes, the shrouded one uses rune magic to create a shadowy scythe blade at the end of a staff and to conjure an aura of tormented souls for protection.": "一个死亡巨人被笼罩者学会了死亡魔法的秘密——有人说是从乌鸦女王那里学来的。一个笼罩者收集倒下同族的头骨，并在这些可怕的收藏品中的一颗珍贵头骨上刻上死亡符文。放弃盔甲，选择阴郁长袍，笼罩者使用符文魔法在法杖末端制造出阴影镰刀，并召唤出一团被折磨的灵魂光环来保护自己。",
	"Over time, the Shadowfell transformed these giants; their bodies shriveled, and their complexions took on a deep-purple hue. They became the first death giants, and their descendants haunt the Shadowfell to this day, searching both that plane and the Material Plane for souls that might please their divine queen.": "随着时间的推移，暗影界改变了这些巨人；他们的身体萎缩，肤色变得深紫色。他们成为了第一批死亡巨人，他们的后代至今仍在暗影界中游荡，搜索着可能取悦他们神圣女王的灵魂，无论是在那个位面还是物质位面。",

	"When Annam's children first began to populate the worlds of the Material Plane, the All-Father created behemoth dinosaurs to live alongside them as companions. The primeval magic used to create the dinosaurs still thrums through their being and manifests in colorful, scar-like lines on their towering bodies. Some of these ancient dinosaurs persist in timeless jungles, hidden enclaves, and other lands untouched by the rest of the world.": "当安南的孩子们开始在物质位面的世界中繁衍时，全父创造了庞大的恐龙，与他们一起生活作伴。用来创造恐龙的原始魔法仍然在它们的身体中回荡，并以色彩斑斓、犹如伤疤般的线条显现在它们高耸的身体上。一些古老的恐龙仍然存在于永恒的丛林、隐秘的飞地和其他未被世界其他地方触及的土地上。",
	"Dust hulks are descended from enclaves of stone giants who lived in extreme environments, isolated from others.

As they fly, coursing along wind currents or blowing through underground tunnels like living sandstorms, they create mesmerizing dances with their ever-shifting forms.": "尘土巨块保留了他们祖先对艺术的热情，但他们不是雕刻石头，而是将自己的身体视为活生生的艺术品。当他们飞行时，顺着风流或穿越地下隧道，就像活生生的沙尘暴一样，他们用不断变化的形态创造出令人着迷的舞蹈。",
	"It's tempting to view the various hulks as symbols of the long, slow decline of the giants as a people. But that's hardly fair to the giants who still survive and thrive in the world, heirs of tremendous glory.": "诱人的是将各种废墟视为巨人作为一个民族长期而缓慢衰落的象征。但这对仍然在世界上生存和繁荣的巨人来说并不公平，他们是巨大荣耀的继承者。",

Whatever the truth of their origin, ettins sometimes recognize a kindred soul in the two-headed Demogorgon and devote themselves to his service. Those who prove exceptionally valuable to Demogorgon's purposes in the Material Plane are rewarded with a \"blessing\" that transforms them into monstrous echoes of their demon patron.": "一些传说声称，第一批双头巨人是被恶魔王子Demogorgon转化而来的兽人，而其他人则将他们的起源与Grolantor或其他奥丁神有关联。无论他们的起源真相如何，双头巨人有时会在双头恶魔Demogorgon中认出同类灵魂，并将自己奉献给他。那些在物质位面上对Demogorgon目的非常有价值的人会得到一种“祝福”，将他们转化为他们的恶魔主人的怪物化身。",
	"The arms of an echo of Demogorgon transform into powerful tentacles, and the heads take on a more bestial appearance. The transformation leaves the echo frenzied with rage; the two heads shout and howl at each other with a fury that resounds with demonic magic, sowing discord and confusion around them. As the echo's monstrous heads roar and bite at each other, nearby creatures are racked with psychic pain or join in the ruckus, attacking their allies.": "厄库( Demogorgon)的回音的手臂变成强大的触手，头部变得更加野兽般。这种转变让回音充满了愤怒；两个头颅愤怒地互相喊叫和嚎叫，这股愤怒带着恶魔魔法的回响，在周围制造混乱和困惑。当回音的怪物头颅咆哮并互相咬斗时，附近的生物被精神痛苦折磨，或加入混乱中，攻击他们的盟友。",
	"Mind flayers, which are described in the{@i Monster Manual}, are created through ceremorphosis, a process that begins with the implantation of an illithid tadpole in the brain of a Humanoid host. Mind flayers have subjected giants to this process in an effort to create larger, stronger mind flayers, but those experiments all ended in failure: a giant's body is simply too large for a single tadpole to take over. Ettins, however, proved to be perfect subjects. An ettin's two brains provide sufficient food for two tadpoles, and the two tadpoles are able to transform the entirety of the ettin's body, creating an ettin ceremorph. As part of the transformation process, one of the ettin's heads sinks into the body, with that brain focused on controlling the body. The other head focuses on cogitation and psionic power, though its power is not as great as a mind flayer's.": "在{@i Monster Manual}中描述的食脑怪通过脑化仪式创造，这个过程始于将一只食脑怪蝌蚪植入一个人形宿主的大脑中。食脑怪试图通过这种方式将巨人置于这个过程中，以创造更大更强的食脑怪，但这些实验都以失败告终：一个巨人的身体太大，无法被单个蝌蚪接管。然而，双头巨人被证明是完美的实验对象。双头巨人的两个大脑提供了足够的食物供两只蝌蚪消耗，这两只蝌蚪能够改造整个双头巨人的身体，创造出一个双头巨人脑化体。作为转化过程的一部分，双头巨人的一个头会沉入身体内，这个大脑专注于控制身体。另一个头专注于思考和精神力量，尽管它的力量不及食脑怪。",

True to their giant heritage, they can transform even a pinch of mud or gravel into a boulder suitable for hurling, and the thrown stone grows in flight to knock its target flat on impact.": "芬西尔（Fensir）的游击队员在战斗中拥有极高的技巧，在伊斯加德（Ysgard）的战场上经过数个世纪的无休止冲突得以磨练。他们还能驾驭地球和石头的元素魔法。忠于他们巨人的遗产，他们甚至可以将一小撮泥土或砂砾变成适合投掷的巨石，而被投掷的石头在飞行中会增大，击倒目标。",
	"Long ago, a band of frost giants led trolls in a campaign to win Annam's favor by conquering the outer plane of Ysgard. The campaign's aspirations of conquest quickly failed, but the raiders discovered a key feature of Ysgard: creatures slain on that plane return to life the next dawn. Thus, the giants' incursion became a part of the eternal battle that rages across the plane. The trolls, whose fundamental nature was altered by constant regeneration and rebirth amid the energy of Ysgard, slowly changed into entirely new creatures: fensirs.": "很久以前，一群霜巨人带领着巨魔展开了一场征战，试图赢得(`Annam`)的青睐，征服外域(`Ysgard`)。征战的雄心很快失败了，但入侵者发现了外域的一个关键特征：在那个位面被杀的生物会在第二天黎明时复活。因此，巨人的入侵成为了横跨该位面的永恒战斗的一部分。那些巨魔，由于在外域的能量中不断重生和再生，他们的基本本质发生了改变，慢慢地变成了全新的生物：(`fensirs`)。",
	"Fensirs' troll ancestry is hardly apparent in their appearance. They retain prominent noses and a hint of green in their skin but otherwise resemble relatively small frost or stone giants. They use armor and weapons similar to what other combatants on Ysgard use in the eternal battle.": "Fensirs（费恩西尔）的巨魔血统在外表上几乎不明显。他们保留了突出的鼻子和皮肤中略带绿色，但在其他方面，他们更像是相对较小的霜巨人或石巨人。他们使用与Ysgard（伊斯加德）上其他战斗者类似的盔甲和武器，参与着永恒战斗。",
	"The transformation that created fensirs left them with an odd quirk to their regenerative powers: their regeneration doesn't function in sunlight, and in fact, sunlight can turn these creatures to stone.": "创造芬西尔的转变留下了一个奇怪的特点，即它们的再生能力在阳光下无法发挥作用，事实上，阳光会将这些生物变成石头。",
	"Bringing trolls to a place where nothing ever truly dies seems like a transparently bad idea. What were those giants thinking?": "把巨魔带到一个永远没有真正死亡的地方似乎是一个显而易见的坏主意。那些巨人在想什么呢？",
	"And yet, can we fairly say that the existence of fensirs is \"transparently bad\"? Some might argue they are a significant improvement over trolls. At the very least, the diversity of life in the multiverse increased, and new wonders were revealed. That's only bad if you think a small universe that fits within your narrow understanding is good.": "然而，我们是否可以公平地说，(`fensirs`)的存在是“透明地糟糕”的？有人可能会认为它们比巨魔要好得多。至少，多元宇宙中生命的多样性增加了，新的奇迹被揭示出来。只有当你认为一个符合你狭隘理解的小宇宙是好的时候，这才是糟糕的。",
	"Like giant priests of Hiatea, firbolgs who serve her fall into two distinct roles that parallel Hiatea's dual nature. At home, primeval wardens tend the hearths and tutor the young. Primeval wardens who patrol the borders of firbolg communities are fierce hunters who guard against external threats and incursions.": "就像海亚提亚的巨大牧师一样，侍奉她的冰巨人分为两种不同的角色，与海亚提亚的双重本质相呼应。在家中，原始守护者照料炉火并教导年轻人。在巡逻冰巨人社区边界的原始守护者是激烈的猎人，他们保护免受外部威胁和侵犯。",

	"Firbolgs are often drawn to the service or emulation of the gods Diancastra and Hiatea. Firbolgs' innate magic of obscurement and trickery resonates with Diancastra's wily resourcefulness. A traditional emphasis on community and harmony leads many firbolgs to pledge themselves to Hiatea's service.": "巨人族常常被吸引到侍奉或模仿女神狄安卡斯特拉(Diancastra)和希亚提亚(Hiatea)。巨人族固有的幻术和诡计魔法与狄安卡斯特拉的狡猾机智相契合。对社区和和谐的传统强调使许多巨人族选择效忠于希亚提亚。",
	"A fire giant who masters traditional rune magic can control the heat of a volcanic environment and conjure raw elemental energy of fire and magma. In a fire giant community, these forgecallers oversee both forges and the community's defense, often in Surtur's name. Some forgecallers prefer to live and work in isolation, seeking the hottest fires in volcanoes' hearts or the Elemental Plane of Fire to pursue their own crafts and studies.": "一位精通传统符文魔法的火巨人可以控制火山环境的热量，并召唤火焰和岩浆的原始元素能量。在火巨人社区中，这些熔炉召唤者负责监督熔炉和社区的防御，通常以苏尔特的名义行事。一些熔炉召唤者更喜欢独自生活和工作，寻找火山心脏中最炽热的火焰或火元素位面，以追求他们自己的工艺和研究。",
	"A forgecaller is a walking furnace, clad head to toe in plate armor that seems to barely contain intense heat and billowing smoke. They conjure waves of magma and can fly by jetting magical fire from their legs and body.": "一位熔炉召唤者是一个行走的熔炉，从头到脚都穿着似乎勉强容纳着强烈热量和滚滚烟雾的板甲。他们能召唤岩浆波，并且可以通过从腿部和身体喷射魔法火焰来飞行。",
	"A fire giant is born around flame, works with flame, and lives among flames, but a fire giant who gazes into flames too deeply may see the Prince of Evil Fire, Imix, gazing back. Giants who fall to Imix's corruption might leave their homes to join with likeminded cultists, but others remain within their communities to pursue Imix's destructive agenda.": "一个火巨人在火焰中诞生，在火焰中工作，在火焰中生活，但是一个深深凝视火焰的火巨人可能会看到邪恶火之王伊米克，正凝视着回来。沉溺于伊米克腐化的巨人可能会离开他们的家园加入志同道合的异教徒，但也有一些留在他们的社区中追随伊米克的毁灭性议程。",
	"A fire giant of Evil Fire forges a set of armor and weapons in flames blessed by Imix. The giant can then call on these magical flames to strike the foes of the Eternal Flame. The armor forged in these flames welds to the flesh, so while the giant isn't burned, the armor can't be removed once donned. When the giant dies, the armor explodes as a final gift from the All-Consuming Fire.": "一个邪恶火焰的火巨人在伊米克斯的祝福下锻造了一套火焰中的盔甲和武器。然后，这个巨人可以召唤这些魔法火焰来打击永恒之焰的敌人。在这些火焰中锻造的盔甲与肌肤融为一体，所以巨人并不会被烧伤，但一旦穿上就无法取下。当巨人死去时，这套盔甲会爆炸，作为全能之火的最后礼物。",
	"To my mind, the fire hellion perfectly illustrates the difference between natural fire and the corrupt flames of the Nine Hells.": "在我看来，火狮（fire hellion）完美地展示了自然火焰与九层地狱（Nine Hells）中腐化火焰之间的区别。",
	"Fire giants study war in its many forms across the multiverse, which sometimes leads the giants to a fascination with the Blood War—the endless conflict between demons and devils across the Lower Planes. Such a giant might enter into a pact with a powerful devil, hoping to learn tactics the devils have fine-tuned over millennia and to acquire magical gifts to help the giant rise in the ordning.": "火巨人研究跨越多元宇宙的各种形式的战争，这有时会导致巨人对血战的着迷——即恶魔和魔鬼在下位面之间的无休止冲突。这样的巨人可能会与一位强大的魔鬼达成协议，希望学习恶魔们在千年间完善的战术，并获得魔法礼物，帮助巨人在等级制度中崛起。",
	"Over time, the giant is corrupted, becoming a Fiend in its own right. The devil teaches the giant how to forge with infernal iron and hellfire, enabling the giant to craft weapons that can funnel the souls of the slain to Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. In this way, the devil stands to gain a constant supply of souls from the giant's enemies, as well as the promise that the giant will serve the devil as a smith in the Nine Hells after death.": "随着时间的推移，这位巨人被腐化，逐渐成为了一个恶魔。恶魔教导这位巨人如何用地狱铁和地狱之火锻造武器，使其能够打造能够将被杀死者的灵魂引流至阿弗努斯（Avernus），九层地狱的第一层。通过这种方式，恶魔可以从巨人的敌人那里获得源源不断的灵魂供应，同时还得到巨人死后在九层地狱中作为铁匠为恶魔服务的承诺。",

	"A fire giant whose burning hatred prevents it from moving on to the afterlife rises as a firegaunt. Spawned from deep rancor, the firegaunt seeks out living creatures to destroy. Like a specter, it doesn't seek redemption; it just hopes to cause as much destruction as possible before attaining its final oblivion.": "一名火巨人，因燃烧的仇恨而无法前往来世，升华为火鬼（firegaunt）。火鬼源自深刻的怨恨，寻找活物来毁灭。就像一个幽灵，它并不寻求救赎；它只希望在达到最终的湮灭之前造成尽可能多的破坏。",

	"During the dawn of the giants' empires, twisted minds sought to make their fallen comrades continue their service.

	"Before their banishment to the Underdark, fomorians ordered themselves based on achievements of knowledge and magical power. Before Karontor urged his descendants into an ill-fated assault against the Feywild, some of the most ambitious, inquisitive, and power-hungry fomorians felt they had already learned all they could from the Material Plane, and they departed to the Inner Planes, where they could continue their journeys of knowledge unopposed.": "在被放逐到地底世界之前，巨人族根据知识和魔法力量的成就来自我排序。在Karontor（卡隆托）督促他的后裔对Feywild（精灵界）发动注定失败的攻击之前，一些雄心勃勃、好奇心强和渴望权力的巨人族感觉他们已经从物质位面学到了所有知识，于是他们离开前往内部位面，在那里他们可以继续他们无人阻挡的知识之旅。",
	"In their arrogance, these fomorian nobles unknowingly escaped the dreadful fate of their kin, and they remain unchanged in their remote enclaves.

	"Some fomorians search for the arcane glory their kind possessed before their banishment into the Underdark. They forge magical pacts with entities of the dark—perhaps powerful Fey of the Gloaming Court or eldritch entities buried deep in the Underdark. Their pacts give these fomorians power over shadows, allowing them to mold and shape darkness like clay.": "一些弗莫里亚人寻求他们被放逐到地底世界之前所拥有的神秘荣耀。他们与黑暗实体结成魔法契约——也许是暮光法庭的强大精灵或深藏在地底深处的奥术实体。这些契约赋予这些弗莫里亚人控制阴影的力量，使他们能够像塑造黏土一样塑造和塑造黑暗。",
	"Descended from Annam's son Karontor, fomorians once occupied a place in the giants' ordning between hill and stone giants. In ancient times, they were scholars of magic known for their keen intellect—but also for their inflated egos and sense of entitlement. Karontor exploited these qualities, tempting them with promises of higher standing in the ordning, and incited his descendants to launch an assault on the Feywild. When the assault failed, the fomorians were banished to the Underdark and their god was consigned to a subterranean prison. Subjected to the strange magic of the Underdark, the fomorians' bodies and souls twisted until they became the fomorians of today.": "源自安南之子卡隆托尔(Karontor)，弗莫尔(Fomorians)曾经在巨人的等级制度中占据了位于丘陵巨人和石巨人之间的地位。在古代，他们是以博学的魔法学者而闻名，以敏锐的智慧著称，但也以他们的自负和特权感而闻名。卡隆托尔利用这些特质，诱使他们承诺在等级制度中获得更高地位，并煽动他的后裔发动对费伊界的攻击。当攻击失败时，弗莫尔被放逐到地底世界，他们的神被囚禁在地下监狱中。在地底世界奇特魔法的影响下，弗莫尔的身体和灵魂扭曲，直到他们成为今天的弗莫尔。",
	"Frost giants who master rune magic are known as ice shapers, and their sheer power typically contributes to a meteoric rise in the giants' ordning.

They are usually devoted to Thrym.": "精通符文魔法的霜巨人被称为冰雕师，他们的强大力量通常会导致他们在巨人的等级制度中迅速崛起。他们中的许多人最终成为了（jarls），领导着他们的社区，或者成为（jarls）的顾问——通常是王座背后的真正力量。他们通常忠于（Thrym）。",
	"True to their name, these ice shapers manipulate the raw elemental energy of air and water to wield ice in both offense and defense. They summon ice elementals in the shape of wolves, cloak themselves in icy armor, and just as quickly turn that armor into a hail of deadly ice shards.": "忠于其名，这些冰雕师利用空气和水的原始元素能量操控冰，既可用于攻击又可用于防御。他们召唤出狼形冰元素，将自己包裹在冰甲中，然后迅速将这层护甲转化为致命的冰雹碎片。",
	"I learned enough about the Temple of Elemental Evil in my studies with Mordenkainen that I regard giants connected to the cult with a healthy amount of respect. When you combine a cultist's fanatical devotion with a giant's sheer power, the result can be horrifying.": "在与莫登凯念(Mordenkainen)的学习中，我对与邪恶元素神殿(Temple of Elemental Evil)有关的巨人充满敬畏。当一个狂热的教徒的虔诚与巨人的强大力量结合在一起时，结果可能令人恐惧。",
	"Though primordials of frost and ice do exist (most notably Cryonax, who is sometimes considered almost the equal of the four Princes of Elemental Evil), frost giants who turn from the gods of the Ordning to embrace Elemental Evil are more likely to serve Olhydra, the Princess of Evil Water. To these giants, water is a cruel and destructive force that finds its ultimate expression in ice. These cultists of Evil Water often hide their allegiance as long as possible while urging their communities to everincreasing depths of cruelty and violence, but if the cultists' apostasy is revealed and they are exiled, they often end up as leaders of Olhydra's cults in colder regions.": "尽管存在冰霜和冰之原初者（最著名的是克赖欧纳克(Cryonax)，有时被认为几乎与四位元素邪恶王子齐名），但那些背弃天位之神而拥护元素邪恶的冰霜巨人更有可能侍奉恶水公主奥赫德拉(Olhydra)。对于这些巨人来说，水是一种残酷而毁灭性的力量，在冰中找到了它的最终表现。这些恶水教徒经常隐藏他们的效忠，尽可能地敦促他们的社区不断加深残忍和暴力，但如果教徒的背教被揭露并被放逐，他们往往最终成为奥赫德拉在寒冷地区的教派的领袖。",
	"Olhydra grants these frost giants the ability to breathe underwater, and they wield armor and weapons that reflect their commitment to the cult. Their armor is outfitted with enormous crossbows that can launch barbed harpoons, which the giants use to drag enemies into or through the water.": "Olhydra授予这些冰巨人在水下呼吸的能力，并且他们装备着反映他们对教派承诺的盔甲和武器。他们的盔甲配备了巨大的弩，可以发射带刺的鱼叉，巨人们用这些鱼叉将敌人拖入水中或穿过水中。",
	"When a frost giant is murdered in a dishonorable manner—perhaps poisoned, stabbed in the back, or killed while sleeping—the slain giant can rise as a frostmourn. Driven by its desire for vengeance, the frostmourn can turn the living into frozen statues with a touch or blast enemies with frigid wind. Achieving vengeance is not always enough to grant these creatures rest; often, their hatred and loathing of the living is sufficient to keep them roaming the wilds for years after their murderers are slain.": "当一名霜巨人以不光彩的方式被谋杀——也许是被毒死、被背后刺杀、或者在睡觉时被杀——被杀的巨人可以升起为一名冰霜哀悼者。被它对复仇的渴望驱使，冰霜哀悼者可以用触摸将活人变成冰冻雕像，或者用寒冷的风攻击敌人。实现复仇并不总是足以让这些生物得到安息；通常，它们对生者的仇恨和厌恶足以让它们在杀手被杀后继续在荒野中徘徊多年。",
	"A frostmourn looks like a desiccated corpse mummified by exposure to bitter cold. It carries the marks of its death on its body: a wound that seeps frosty vapor or vibrant, purple veins showing the ravages of poison. It can momentarily dissolve its body into a swirling blizzard to avoid harm, reforming at a distance to continue its assault.": "一把霜晨之刃看起来像是被严寒曝晒后干瘪的尸体。它的身体上带着死亡的痕迹：一个冒着霜气的伤口，或是显示着毒素摧残的充满活力的紫色血管。它可以瞬间将自己融入旋转的暴风雪中以避免伤害，然后重新组合在远处继续攻击。",
	"Frost giants who struggle to rise in their ordning, along with those who reject Annam and his children, sometimes turn to the worship of the demon lord Kostchtchie. In the myths of these giants, Kostchtchie was once a frost giant of such tremendous might that he slew a demon lord in single combat, claimed its Abyssal realm for himself, and now waits for other frost giants to join him in conquering the rest of the Abyss.": "那些在他们的等级制度中挣扎的霜巨人，以及那些拒绝安南和他的子民的人，有时会转向崇拜恶魔领主科斯特奇。在这些巨人的神话中，科斯特奇曾经是一个力量强大的霜巨人，他单挑击败了一个恶魔领主，夺取了它的深渊领域，并现在等待其他霜巨人加入他，征服深渊的其他部分。",
	"When Kostchtchie answers the pleas of giants, he gives them supernatural strength and ferocious bloodlust. The giants' muscles expand, their arms extend past their knees, and bitter cold surrounds them. The demon lord's gifts come at a cost, though, as the giants' souls slowly burn away to fuel these newfound powers. Over time, the sensation of burning in the chest intensifies, driving these giants into a frenzy. The newly transformed Fiends quickly find that only combat can numb the burning.": "当科斯特奇（Kostchtchie）回应巨人的请求时，他赋予他们超自然的力量和凶猛的嗜血欲。巨人的肌肉膨胀，他们的手臂延伸至膝盖以上，周围笼罩着刺骨的寒冷。然而，这位恶魔领主的恩赐是有代价的，因为巨人的灵魂会慢慢燃烧以供养这些新获得的力量。随着时间的推移，胸中燃烧的感觉会加剧，将这些巨人推向狂暴状态。新变身的恶魔迅速发现，只有战斗才能麻木这种燃烧感。",
	"From time to time—perhaps once a generation, under a particular configuration of stars and planets, or at the whim of some malicious god—a gargantua is born to giant parents. Though the child appears like any other of its kind, the creature's true nature manifests upon reaching adulthood: its complexion turns purplish and horns sprout from its head. The gargantua grows rapidly, eventually towering over other giants at a height of 40 feet or more.": "偶尔—也许是一代人一次，在特定星体和行星的配置下，或者在某位恶意之神的心血来潮下—一个巨人的父母会诞生出一只巨兽。尽管这个孩子看起来和其他同类一样，但当它长到成年时，它的真正本性会显现出来：它的肤色变成紫色，头上长出了角。这只巨兽迅速长大，最终高达40英尺甚至更高，超过其他巨人的身高。",
	"Most gargantuas do not feel at home in giant communities and end up searching for homes large enough to hold their enormous frames. They might find a suitable home in an ancient forest, a deep canyon, or an immense cavern in the Underdark. Some gargantuas seek only peace and solitude, while others lash out fiercely at a world that fears them.": "大多数巨兽在巨大的社区中感到不自在，最终会寻找足够大的家园来容纳他们庞大的身躯。它们可能会在一片古老的森林、一个深邃的峡谷，或者是地下世界的一个巨大洞穴中找到合适的住所。一些巨兽只寻求和平与孤独，而另一些则猛烈地反击一个害怕它们的世界。",
	"Giants tell a variety of stories to explain the existence of gargantuas. One tale connects their origin to an ancient enclave's pact with an entity from the Far Realm. Another claims that Karontor, \"the banished son\" of Annam, creates gargantuas in retaliation for his imprisonment. A third blames Annam, claiming the All-Father of the giants is disgusted with his descendants and seeks to destroy them.": "巨人们讲述各种故事来解释巨兽的存在。一个传说将它们的起源与古老飞境（Far Realm）的实体达成的协议联系在一起。另一个声称Karontor，安南姆（Annam）的“被放逐之子”，为了报复而创造了巨兽。第三个则责怪安南姆，声称巨人之父对他的后代感到恶心，并试图摧毁他们。",
	"Giants keep geese as livestock for eggs and because geese make excellent sentries, protecting the giants' property with their keen senses and loud voices. Not only are giant geese from fey stock significantly larger than ordinary geese, but they also have two magical properties that make them even more valuable: their honk is a powerful defense against intruders, and they can lay eggs with shells of pure gold.": "巨人们将鹅作为家畜来产蛋，因为鹅在巨人的财产中担任卓越的哨兵，凭借敏锐的感觉和响亮的声音保护着巨人的财产。巨人饲养的精灵血统的巨型鹅不仅比普通鹅大得多，而且还具有两种使它们更有价值的魔法属性：它们的嘎嘎声对入侵者具有强大的防御作用，而且它们能够产下纯金蛋壳的蛋。",
	"When commanded by its keeper, a giant goose lays a golden egg—a hollow shell of gold, 1 foot long and weighing 2 pounds. The shell is worth 100 gp. Sometimes, the egg inexplicably contains some kind of small trinket or minor magic item. Once it lays a golden egg, a giant goose can't do so again for a year and a day.": "当被其主人命令时，一只巨型鹅会下一个金蛋——一个空心的金壳，长1英尺，重2磅。这个金壳价值100 gp。有时，这个蛋里会莫名其妙地包含一些小玩意或次要魔法物品。一旦下了一个金蛋，一只巨型鹅在一年零一天内不能再下一个。",

Their coats grow lighter in winter, helping to camouflage them in their favored habitats even when the landscape is draped in snow.": "尽管它们经常被误认为是平凡的猫，巨型山猫是一种神奇生物，起源于仙境中雪覆盖的林地。它们的毛皮在冬天变得更浅，有助于在它们喜欢的栖息地中伪装自己，即使周围的景观被雪覆盖。",
	"Giant lynxes are crafty hunters, cooperating in small groups to trap prey and occasionally using a magical gift to scout likely hunting locations. They're also smart enough to outwit many of the hunters who seek to trap them for their fur, and they're fond of disabling any trappers' snares they find in their territories.": "巨型山猫是狡猾的猎手，它们会组成小团体合作捕猎猎物，偶尔会利用一种魔法天赋来侦查可能的狩猎地点。它们还足够聪明，可以智胜许多试图为了毛皮而捕捉它们的猎人，它们喜欢使劲地破坏在自己领地发现的陷阱。",

	"Giant rams are prized livestock among giants. The rams' fleece stores magical energy by absorbing ambient magic and drawing power from spells.

	"If the fleece is shorn from the ram without damaging the creature, it can be made into a protective magical garment. When woven into cloth, the fleece serves as a cloak of protection. It can also be woven into the lining of armor to make armor of resistance that protects against cold, fire, or lightning damage.": "如果从公羊身上剪下羊毛而不伤害生物，它可以制成一件防护性的魔法服装。当编织成布料时，这块羊毛可以成为一件保护斗篷。它也可以编织到盔甲的内衬中，制成一件抗性盔甲，可以保护免受寒冷、火焰或闪电伤害。",

	"A gigant resembles an enormous beetle with legs ending in sharp talons. It uses its talons to bring creatures to its enormous mandibles, which are strong enough to carry a giant to the gigant's nest to be devoured.": "一只巨蚁酷似一只巨大的甲壳虫，它的腿末端长有锋利的爪子。它利用这些爪子将生物带到它巨大的大颚处，这些大颚足够强壮，可以将一个巨人带到巨蚁的巢穴中被吞噬。",
	"A gigant's wings are usually folded under its carapace, but the speedy flier can also beat its wings to create a horrible sound or to spread a toxic dust.": "巨人的翅膀通常折叠在其甲壳下，但这种快速飞行者也可以拍打翅膀发出可怕的声音，或散播有毒尘埃。",
	"Goliaths are Humanoids distantly related to giants. Infused with the supernatural essence of their ancestors' mountainous home, goliaths have the strength and fortitude to garner a giant's respect. Communities of goliaths who live in close relationship with giants emulate them and are recognized by the giants as kin. These goliath giant-kin often act as liaisons between giant clans and other Humanoids.": "巨人族是与巨人有着遥远亲缘关系的人形生物。他们体内注入了祖先所居住的山区的超自然本质，使得他们拥有足以赢得巨人尊重的力量和坚韧。与巨人保持密切关系的巨人族社区效仿他们，被巨人认定为同族。这些巨人族巨人血脉的人常常充当巨人家族与其他人形生物之间的联络者。",
	"Though they rarely stand more than 8 feet tall, goliaths can hold their own in contests of strength with ogres. Goliath giant-kin can also channel the magic of their giant relatives into mighty melee attacks.": "尽管他们很少超过8英尺高，但巨人族的戈利亚人在与食人魔的力量比拼中能够自持。戈利亚人巨人血统也能将他们巨人亲戚的魔法转化为强大的近战攻击。",
	"Though they are not part of the ordning, goliath giant-kin often revere the divine ancestors of the giants, with a particular affinity for Annam's daughters: Diancastra, Hiatea, and Iallanis. They also tend to extol the same virtues as the giants they live alongside, so goliath giant-kin dwelling near frost giants boast of their might, while those dwelling with stone giants cherish artistry.": "尽管他们不属于（the ordning）, 巨人血统的巨人族常常崇敬巨人的神圣祖先，特别是安纳姆（Annam）的女儿：迪安卡斯特拉（Diancastra）, 海亚提亚（Hiatea）, 和伊阿拉尼斯（Iallanis）。他们也倾向于颂扬与他们同住的巨人相同的美德，因此，与霜巨人同居的巨人血统的巨人族夸耀他们的力量，而与石巨人同居的巨人族珍视艺术。",
	"Few things bring me as much delight as goliaths who strive to celebrate their connection to the magnificent history of giants. When they sing me hymns, their voices are sweetest.": "没有什么能像努力庆祝他们与巨人辉煌历史联系的巨人们那样让我感到愉悦。当他们向我唱赞美诗时，他们的声音是最甜美的。",
	"Grinning cats are mischievous Fey who delight in pestering and misleading travelers. They resemble oversized domestic cats with long, needlelike claws, but they're distinguished by the wide, toothy smiles that give them their name.": "咧嘴笑的猫是调皮的精灵，喜欢捉弄和误导旅行者。它们看起来像超大号的家猫，长着针一样的爪子，但它们的宽阔、露齿的笑容是它们得名的特征。",
	"Grinning cats often dwell in or near giants' enclaves. They spend much of their time invisible, lounging on tree branches until prey—or a potential conversation partner—wanders by. While trading riddles or witticisms, a cat often decides to reveal its grin, its tail, or sometimes its whole head to confuse or intimidate the creature it's talking to.": "咧嘴的猫经常栖息在或靠近巨人的聚居地。它们大部分时间都处于隐形状态，懒洋洋地躺在树枝上，直到猎物或潜在的交谈对象经过。在交换谜语或妙语之际，猫经常决定展示它的咧嘴、尾巴，有时甚至是整个头部，以迷惑或威胁正在交谈的生物。",
	"A grinning cat can be persuaded to bestow one of its whiskers as a gift. A creature holding a whisker can use it to cast the misty step spell once, then the whisker turns to smoke and is destroyed. If a grinning cat is slain, {@dice 2d12} of its whiskers can be retrieved for this purpose.": "一个笑嘻嘻的猫可以被说服赠送它的胡须作为礼物。持有胡须的生物可以使用它施放一次迷雾步法术，然后胡须变成烟雾并被摧毁。如果一只笑嘻嘻的猫被杀死，可以回收{@dice 2d12}它的胡须用于这个目的。",
	"My one and only interaction with a grinning cat made me want to wipe the smirk off that thing's face with a great big clenched fist, if you get my meaning.": "我和一只咧着嘴笑的猫的唯一互动让我想用紧握的大拳头把那家伙脸上的笑容抹掉，如果你明白我的意思的话。",
	"Trust me when I tell you that the cat was every bit as annoyed as you were, my friend.": "相信我告诉你，那只猫和你一样恼火，我的朋友。",
	"Hill giants who master rune magic discover a close connection to the natural forces of earth and stone. Their magic, combined with their size and strength, helps them quickly rise to positions of leadership.": "掌握符文魔法的丘陵巨人发现与大地和石头的自然力量有着密切联系。他们的魔法，结合他们的体型和力量，帮助他们迅速晋升到领导地位。",
	"These hill giants drape themselves in rocks attached to chains or ropes, then use their magic to knock down and pummel their foes with these stones. This magic, combined with their ability to defeat and devour their prey as quickly as a torrent of boulders cascades down a mountain, leads other giants to call them avalanchers.": "这些山岭巨人将自己裹上用链条或绳索固定的岩石，然后利用他们的魔法用这些石头击倒并殴打他们的敌人。这种魔法，再加上他们能够像山上的巨石洪流一样迅速击败并吞噬猎物的能力，让其他巨人称呼他们为\"雪崩者\"。",
	"At least the lightning hulk and the dust hulk seem satisfied with their lot in life. There's a grace to their existence, as fractured as it seems.": "至少闪电巨怪和尘土巨怪似乎对自己的生活感到满足。尽管看起来有些支离破碎，但它们的存在有一种优雅之感。",
	"Lightning hulks are the descendants of storm giants who retreated from the world in ages past. Over the course of centuries, the elemental nature of these giants—aided by infusions of energy from the Elemental Planes—grew to dominate these giants, eventually freeing them from the limitations of flesh.": "闪电巨汉是风暴巨人的后裔，他们在很久以前就从世界上撤退了。几个世纪以来，这些巨人的元素本质——在元素位面的能量注入的帮助下——逐渐主导了这些巨人，最终使他们摆脱了肉体的限制。",
	"A lightning hulk is essentially a living bolt of lightning, with the one lasting vestige of its former nature being a vague face that appears at the head of the bolt as it streams through the air. In rare moments, the hulk coalesces into a bipedal shape resembling a storm giant, but these moments are as fleeting as a lightning strike. At other times, particularly when near metal or solid earth, the hulk seems on the verge of dispersing entirely, losing its last shreds of cohesion as a single entity. Its mental state is similarly incoherent: a lightning hulk rushes from one place to another with little sense of purpose and no hint of the contemplation that occupies its distant cousin giants.": "一道闪电巨怪本质上是一团活生生的闪电，唯一持续存在的前身特征是在闪电头部出现的模糊面孔。在罕见的时刻，巨怪会凝聚成类似风暴巨人的两足形态，但这些时刻如同闪电一样瞬息即逝。在其他时候，特别是在靠近金属或坚实土地时，巨怪似乎快要完全散去，失去作为一个整体的最后一丝凝聚力。它的精神状态同样不连贯：一道闪电巨怪毫无目的地从一个地方冲到另一个地方，没有任何思考的迹象，也不像它的远房巨人表亲们那样沉思。",
	"Hill giants are known for their voracious appetites, which can attract the attention of the demon lord Yeenoghu, known as the Beast of Butchery. A cruel hill giant sometimes turns to Yeenoghu for help in expanding the reach of its malevolence. Occasionally a hill giant consumes an evil artifact that transforms the giant into a fiendish form. Once in a while, Yeenoghu whispers promises of power in the dreams of a giant whose hunger surpasses other giants'. In any case, the result is a ravenous monster called a maw of Yeenoghu, which is wholly devoted to the demon lord.": "山岭巨人以其贪婪的食欲而闻名，这可能会引起恶魔领主伊诺古(Yeenoghu)的注意，他被称为屠戮之兽(Beast of Butchery)。有时，残忍的山岭巨人会求助于伊诺古，以扩大其邪恶的影响范围。偶尔，一名山岭巨人会吞食一件邪恶的神器，将其转化为邪恶的形态。偶尔，伊诺古会在那些食欲超越其他巨人的巨人的梦中低语，许诺力量。无论如何，结果都是一个名为伊诺古之口(Maw of Yeenoghu)的贪婪怪物，完全臣服于这位恶魔领主。",
	"A maw of Yeenoghu grows a mane of hair and hunches over like a gnoll. Its jaw grows and widens, and its mouth fills with multiple rows of sharp teeth. These teeth constantly grow, driving the maw to bite and chew on anything within reach. Some maws desperately rip the teeth from their mouth for relief, but the teeth quickly regrow. Cunning maws use this phenomenon as a ready supply of weaponry, throwing clusters of teeth at their foes.": "一个伊诺古的巨口长出了一头鬃毛，弯腰驼背像一只豺狼人。它的下颚变长变宽，嘴里长满了多排锋利的牙齿。这些牙齿不断生长，驱使着巨口咬碎和咀嚼一切能够触及的东西。一些巨口绝望地从嘴里拔出牙齿以求解脱，但牙齿很快就会重新长出。狡猾的巨口利用这一现象作为武器的来源，向敌人扔出一团团牙齿。",
	"A maw of Yeenoghu charges at its prey on all fours with its mouth wide open, scraping the ground like a plow.": "一只伊诺古的巨口四肢着地冲向猎物，张着大嘴，像犁一样刮着地面。",
	"I mourn for the hulks, all of them. The sight of a mist hulk, in particular, fills me with a melancholy that is hard to shake off.": "我为这些废墟感到悲伤，所有的废墟。尤其是看到一只雾废魁，让我充满了一种难以摆脱的忧郁。",
	"Descended from ancient cloud giants, mist hulks are Elementals that embody their ancestors' mixed elemental nature of Air and Water. After countless ages of isolation—often on one of the Elemental Planes or some hidden demiplane—they retain the barest hint of their ancestors' physical form, and even less of the giants' culture.": "源自古代云巨人的雾巨兽是元素生物，体现了它们祖先混合的风和水元素本质。经过无数个世纪的孤立生活——通常是在元素位面之一或某个隐藏的半位面上——它们保留了祖先身体形态的微弱痕迹，甚至更少了巨人的文化。",
	"A mist hulk resembles a bipedal figure made of dark rain clouds. Parts of its body seem more solid than others, but these parts are transparent enough that the churning vapors of the hulk's substance are visible inside. Wisps of cloud constantly leak from the creature, as if it might dissolve completely at any time. When it is slain, its misty form condenses into a torrent of water.": "一只雾巨兽类似于一个由黑暗雨云构成的两足人形。它的身体部分似乎比其他部分更加坚实，但这些部分透明度足够高，以至于可以看到巨兽实质内部翻腾的蒸汽。云雾的细丝不断地从这个生物中泄漏出来，仿佛它随时可能完全溶解。当它被杀死时，它雾状的形态会凝结成一股水流。",
	"A mist hulk's mood is always gloomy, and when threatened, it often howls in infectious misery. All who hear this wail are magically reminded of past regrets, real or imagined.": "一只迷雾巨怪的情绪总是阴郁的，当受到威胁时，它经常发出传染性的悲伤嚎叫。所有听到这声哀嚎的人都会被魔法般地提醒起过去的遗憾，无论是真实的还是想象的。",
	"The ancestors of mud hulks were hill giants who, living in isolation, ate everything within reach until they were forced to subsist on the earth itself. The giants' elemental nature asserted itself and transformed them into creatures of living mud.": "泥块巨人的祖先是山岭巨人，他们生活在孤立之地，吞噬一切可及之物，直到被迫以大地本身为生。巨人们的元素本质显现出来，将他们转变成了活泥生物。",
	"A mud hulk vaguely resembles its ancestors, but its body consists of wet mud that constantly sloughs off around it, creating thick pools of the stuff everywhere the creature goes. It retains the hunger of a hill giant, enveloping anything even vaguely edible and directly absorbing it into its body. When threatened, it hurls masses of mud at its enemies to make sure they stay in place long enough for the mud hulk to consume them.": "一个泥浆巨怪模糊地类似于它的祖先，但它的身体由湿泥组成，不断地在它周围脱落，形成厚厚的泥浆池，无论这个生物走到哪里都会留下泥浆。它保留了山岭巨人的饥饿感，吞噬任何稍微可食用的东西，并直接将其吸收到自己的身体中。当受到威胁时，它会向敌人投掷大量泥浆，确保它们停留足够长的时间，以便泥浆巨怪吞噬它们。",
	"Well, while you're mourning, that thing is trying to engulf me in mud! Pardon me while I interpose a hand to keep it away from me.": "当你在哀悼的时候，那个东西正试图用泥巴把我吞没！请原谅我，我得伸手挡住它，不让它靠近我。",
	"Aptly called \"the ruler of dinosaurs,\" a regisaur is an enormous predator large enough to swallow a giant whole. Fiery veins of elemental energy course through its skin and glow in its eyes and nostrils.": "被恰如其名地称为“恐龙之王”，暴龙是一种巨大的掠食者，体型足够大，可以一口吞下一只巨人。元素能量的火红血脉流淌在它的皮肤中，在它的眼睛和鼻孔中闪耀。",
	"Rime hulks are a withered branch of the frost giant family tree, descended from ancient giants who withdrew from the world and succumbed to their elemental nature. Most rime hulks dwell in the Frostfell, the \"plane of ice\" that forms the border between the Elemental Planes of Air and Water. Others lurk in isolated rifts in enormous polar glaciers.": "霜巨人（Frost Giants）家族中的一支，霜巨人的一支枯萎的分支，是古代巨人的后裔，他们从世界上隐退，并屈从于他们的元素本质。大多数霜巨人居住在霜之地（Frostfell），这是位于空气元素位面和水元素位面之间的“冰之位面”。其他一些潜伏在巨大极地冰川中的孤立裂口中。",
	"Smaller and weaker than their ancestors, rime hulks are roughly formed masses of frost and ice. Their vaguely giant-shaped physical forms are unstable, constantly breaking apart and reforming as clouds of frost billow off them. As a rime hulk moves, it leaves a trail of ice that can freeze enemies in place. When it dies, a rime hulk explodes in a burst of frost.": "比起它们的祖先，冰霜巨怪(rime hulks)更小更弱，它们大致是由霜和冰形成的团块。它们模糊的巨人形态不稳定，不断地破碎和重组，周围会卷起一团团霜云。当冰霜巨怪移动时，会留下一道可以冻结敌人的冰径。当它死去时，会爆炸成一团霜的爆炸。",
	"In all seriousness, though, it's best not to get caught up in what these hulks were or might have become had things gone differently for them. They're dangerous, and most of them do not wish you well. Act accordingly.": "说真的，最好不要纠缠于这些庞然大物本来是什么，或者如果事情发展不同他们可能会变成什么样。它们是危险的，大多数并不希望你好。要相应地行动。",
	"According to{@i The Saga of the Dragon Queller}, told by giants on some worlds, a disparate group of giants combined their efforts to protect their ancient empire from a particularly vicious dragon. Stone and hill giants hewed a mighty form from living stone. Cloud and frost giants gathered rare metals, and fire giants shaped them into flexible joints and plated armor. Storm giants inscribed runes into the inert form to give it the semblance of life. The fruit of these labors was an everlasting guardian: the first runic colossus.": "根据{@i The Saga of the Dragon Queller}，在一些世界上的巨人传说中，一群不同种类的巨人联合起来，保护他们古老帝国免受一条特别凶猛的巨龙的侵袭。石巨人和丘陵巨人从活石中雕刻出一个强大的形态。云巨人和霜巨人收集稀有金属，火巨人将其塑造成灵活的关节和装甲。风暴巨人在这个惰性形态上刻写符文，赋予它生命的幻象。这些劳动的成果是一个永恒的守护者：第一个符文巨像。",
	"A runic colossus stands 30 feet tall. It regards all non-giants as a threat, and unless it has other orders, it attacks such creatures on sight.": "一个符文巨像高30英尺。它将所有非巨人视为威胁，除非它有其他命令，否则会一见到这类生物就发动攻击。",
	"The art of crafting a runic colossus is lost to modern giants, but many tales suggest the instructions might be buried deep in ruins from ancient giants' empires.": "现代巨人已经失去了制作符文巨像的艺术，但许多传说暗示这些指导可能被埋藏在古代巨人帝国的废墟深处。",

	"Giants are descended from the All-Father, Annam, and his children. But scions of giants' gods boast a greater claim: they are Annam's grandchildren, and they occupy a privileged place among giants. On some worlds, these scions ruled the first empires of giants until Annam retreated into seclusion. On other worlds, the scions guard their birthplaces (which are rich in elemental magic) or hold the substance of the world together. (See \" Giants of Myth \" in chapter 3 for additional inspiration.)": "巨人是由全父安南（Annam）及其子孙后代。但巨人之神的后代却拥有更大的权利：他们是安南的孙子，他们在巨人族中占据着特权地位。在一些世界上，这些后代统治着巨人的第一个帝国，直到安南隐居。在其他世界上，这些后代守护着他们的诞生地（富含元素魔法），或者维系着世界的实质。（请参阅第3章的“神话巨人”以获得额外灵感。）",
	"Scions of giants' gods are enormously powerful beings who infuse the world around them with primeval magic. In many worlds, they slumber and have become part of the landscape. In this case, each scion is enclosed in stasis inside a powerful Elemental called a cradle. The cradle protects the slumbering scion and follows its subconscious wishes, including driving off intruders. But if the cradle dies, the scion within fully awakens.": "巨人之神的后裔是极其强大的存在，他们用原始魔法充盈周围的世界。在许多世界中，他们沉睡并融入了景观之中。在这种情况下，每个后裔被封存在一个强大的元素体内，称为摇篮。摇篮保护着沉睡的后裔，并遵循其潜意识的愿望，包括驱赶入侵者。但如果摇篮死亡，内部的后裔将完全苏醒。",
	"A cloud giant that dies through an act of betrayal or an ill-fated wager sometimes returns as a spectral cloud. While this Undead seems to be merely a thick cloud or fog bank, observers can sometimes spot a shadowy bipedal figure lurking within. At the heart of the cloud, the figure's appearance becomes clear: a skeletal cloud giant corpse.": "当一位风巨人因背叛或不幸的赌注而死亡时，有时会以亡灵云的形式返回。虽然这种亡灵看起来只是一团浓密的云雾，但观察者有时可以看到一个阴影般的两足身影潜伏其中。在云的中心，这个身影的外貌变得清晰：一个骨骼风巨人的尸体。",
	"Tales suggest cloud giants sometimes seek this fate rather than accept the end of their naturally long lives. In such stories, a cloud giant undergoes a ritual in which its heart is transplanted into a cloud, causing the giant's body to dissolve and its spirit to animate the cloud.": "传说中，有时云巨人会选择这种命运，而不是接受他们自然漫长生命的终结。在这类故事中，云巨人会经历一种仪式，将其心脏移植到一朵云中，导致巨人的身体溶解，而其精神则使云得以活跃。",
	"When it comes to infiltrating giant steadings, I must admit that spotted lions are in some ways preferable to, say, dire wolves or cave bears. Namely, if they're well fed, they're more likely to stretch and yawn than they are to raise an alarm when they spot you.": "当涉及渗透巨型驻地时，我必须承认，斑点狮在某些方面比恐狼或洞穴熊更可取。换句话说，如果它们吃饱了，它们更有可能伸个懒腰而不是在发现你时发出警报。",
	"Roughly twice the size of a common lion, a spotted lion has a dusky coat and mane, both speckled with charcoal-colored spots. Spotted lions gather in prides to hunt enormous prey ranging from giant elk to mammoths. Stone and cloud giants often keep these massive beasts as pets and hunting companions.": "一只花斑狮大约是一只普通狮子的两倍大小，它有一身暗色的被毛和鬃毛，上面布满了炭灰色的斑点。花斑狮会聚集成群，一起狩猎从巨大的麋鹿到猛犸象等庞大的猎物。石巨人和云巨人经常把这些巨大的野兽当作宠物和狩猎伙伴。",
	"Demon worship is rare among stone giants; the destructive tendency of demons is the antithesis of the artistry that drives the stone giant's ordning. The Horned King, Baphomet, is an exception. Though he is a merciless hunter, the Prince of Beasts also crafts complex mazes as his hunting grounds. Stone giants can become mesmerized by the demon lord's mazes and enter his service. These giants can continue pursuing art by crafting mazes, while satiating their bloodlust by hunting in them.": "石巨人中很少有崇拜恶魔的行为；恶魔的破坏倾向与驱动石巨人等级制度的艺术精神背道而驰。然而，有一个例外，那就是有角之王，巴尔福梅(Baphomet)。尽管他是一个无情的猎手，作为野兽之王，他也会建造复杂的迷宫作为狩猎场所。石巨人可能会被这位恶魔领主的迷宫所迷惑，从而投身于他的服务。这些巨人可以通过制作迷宫继续追求艺术，同时在其中狩猎以满足他们的嗜血欲望。",
	"Baphomet rewards his most faithful cultists with transformation into demonic stalkers. Such a giant grows an elaborate crown of six horns, and Baphomet gives the stone giant a magic glaive and the ability to call up horns of stone from the earth.": "巴福梅特奖励他最忠诚的教徒，将他们转化为恶魔追猎者。这样的巨人长出一个复杂的六角冠，巴福梅特赐予这个石巨人一把魔法戈饲，并赋予他从大地召唤石角的能力。",
	"Stone giants with a bent toward cruelty and destruction might reject the gods of the Ordning and turn to the worship of Ogrémoch, the Prince of Evil Earth. These giants view the surface world not as a realm of dream but as a nightmare worthy only of destruction, so they lend their strength to cults that plan to reduce the world to rubble.": "对于倾向于残忍和破坏的石巨人可能会拒绝Ordning之神，转而崇拜邪恶土之王Ogrémoch。这些巨人将地表世界视为噩梦之地，只配被摧毁，因此他们支持那些计划将世界化为废墟的异教团体。",

These giants serve as the muscle for the cult, wielding their might to destroy the surface world in the name of Ogrémoch.": "穿着重型盔甲，仿照邪恶大地之神的石巨人装备，手持雷鸣能量的武器。这些巨人是该邪教的力量来源，动用他们的力量摧毁地表世界，以奥格雷莫克的名义行事。",
	"Stone giants practice rune magic more than other giants do, perhaps because of these giants' interest in and aptitude for carving stone. Stone giants who combine this magic with prodigious artistic skill are called rockspeakers. Within their communities, they act as leaders and oracles.": "石巨人比其他巨人更多地练习符文魔法，也许是因为这些巨人对雕刻石头的兴趣和天赋。将这种魔法与惊人的艺术技巧相结合的石巨人被称为岩语者。在他们的社区中，他们充当领袖和神谕。",
	"Rockspeakers incorporate crystals and stones into their clothing and embed them in their skin. By invoking the power of their stone runes, these giants can turn these crystals into scintillating works of art. In combat, rockspeakers can use this same magic to cause their crystals to emit brilliantly colored, intense beams of light than can sear flesh and inhibit enemies.": "岩石演说者将水晶和石头编织进他们的衣服，并将它们嵌入皮肤中。通过唤起他们石头符文的力量，这些巨人可以将这些水晶变成闪烁的艺术品。在战斗中，岩石演说者可以利用同样的魔法让他们的水晶发出明亮多彩、强烈的光束，可以灼烧肉体并抑制敌人。",
	"Storm crabs are colossal crustaceans with four monstrous claws and a poisonous stinger. Equally adept underwater or on shore, they can exhale a jet of pressurized water to crush foes.": "风暴蟹是巨大的甲壳类动物，有四只巨大的爪子和一根有毒的刺。它们在水下或岸上同样熟练，可以喷出高压水柱来压碎敌人。",
	"Giants on some worlds claim Stronmaus or one of his children created storm crabs in the early years of an ancient empire. Just as behirs were created to fight dragons on land and rocs to challenge dragons' mastery of the sky, storm crabs were meant to battle dragon turtles, bronze dragons, and other aquatic foes. On many worlds, these creatures fiercely guard the underwater strongholds of storm giants, as well as the ruined keeps giants have abandoned.": "在一些世界上，巨人声称斯特隆莫斯(Stronmaus)或他的子孙在古代帝国的早期创造了风暴螃蟹。正如贝希尔(behir)被创造来对抗陆地上的龙，石鹰(roc)挑战龙在天空的统治一样，风暴螃蟹被创造来与龙龟、青铜龙和其他水生敌人作战。在许多世界上，这些生物激烈地守护着风巨人的水下据点，以及巨人已经放弃的废墟要塞。",
	"Given all the weird things that swim in the deep ocean, who am I to complain about a colossal crab with a poison stinger that can knock you away with a high-speed jet of water?": "考虑到深海中游弋的各种奇怪生物，我又有什么资格抱怨一个巨大的螃蟹，它有一根带毒刺的毒针，可以用高速喷射的水流将你击倒呢？",
	"While most storm giants care little for the intricate details of ranking in the ordning, tempest callers proudly claim a position at the pinnacle of that ranking—and few dare to challenge them. Wielding the power of rune magic in addition to the innate magic that courses through them, these storm giants are highly respected. If any giant can draw Annam's attention to the world, it would likely be a tempest caller.": "虽然大多数风暴巨人对于“奥定律”中的排名细节并不关心，但风暴召唤者们自豪地宣称自己处于该排名的顶峰位置——很少有人敢挑战他们。除了体内流淌的先天魔法外，这些风暴巨人还能驾驭符文魔法的力量，因此备受尊敬。如果有任何巨人能够引起安南对世界的关注，那很可能就是一位风暴召唤者。",
	"Tempest callers implant crystal balls inscribed with the storm rune into their foreheads or eye sockets, allowing them to see through magical deception. They can also create a momentary vortex of freezing winds and storm clouds around themselves, engulfing their foes in elemental fury.": "风暴召唤者将镶有风暴符文的水晶球植入他们的额头或眼眶，使他们能够看穿魔法欺骗。他们还可以在自身周围制造瞬时的冰冷风暴和暴风云漩涡，将敌人卷入元素之怒中。",
	"Ancient and alien beings dwell or slumber in ocean depths, awaiting some cosmic circumstance that signals their time to rise. In their retreat from the world, storm giants sometimes stray into the orbit of such creatures, perhaps while seeking insight into some omen, vision, or prophecy.

If a creature tries to attack it from beyond its reach or to escape through a small tunnel, the troll amalgam tears off a piece of its own body and hurls it at the creature. These body parts eventually regenerate into full trolls, and sometimes they regather and combine into a new troll amalgam.": "一个巨魔混合体是一团畸形的橡胶般肉体，有爪子和面孔。如果一个生物试图从它的攻击范围之外攻击它，或者试图通过一个小通道逃跑，巨魔混合体会撕下自己身体的一部分朝生物投掷。这些身体部分最终会再生成完整的巨魔，有时它们会重新聚集并合并成一个新的巨魔混合体。",
	"When exposed to corrupting alien energy, such as that found near a gate to the Far Realm or the strange magic that emanates through the Underdark, a regenerating troll undergoes strange mutations. Among the most common mutations are wings, stretchable bodies, resistance to magic, and a strange reflective psychic property. Many troll mutates also have small additional limbs and eyes, externalized organs, and other variations.": "当暴露于腐化的外星能量时，比如在通往远境之门附近发现的能量，或是从地底世界散发出的奇异魔法，一只再生巨魔会经历奇怪的变异。最常见的变异包括长翅膀、可伸展的身体、对魔法的抗性，以及一种奇怪的反射心灵属性。许多巨魔变异体还会有额外的小肢体和眼睛，外部器官，以及其他变异。",
	"The dwarven tale titled{@i The Saga of Gnarldan Steelshield}claims the god Vaprak the Destroyer came into being when Annam was injured and his blood spilled on the ground. The saga further claims that trolls were born similarly when Vaprak's blood was spilled. Whatever the truth of their origin, trolls embody life's steadfast determination to grow and thrive despite all obstacles.": "矮人传说{@i The Saga of Gnarldan Steelshield}中称，毁灭者瓦普拉克之神是在安南受伤并鲜血洒落在地时诞生的。传说还声称，当瓦普拉克的血液洒落时，巨魔也是以类似方式诞生的。无论它们起源的真相如何，巨魔体现了生命坚定不移地在各种障碍中生长和茁壮的决心。",
	"Trolls' rapid healing makes them subject to bizarre mutations, particularly when they regenerate in unusual environments or heal from extraordinary magical wounds. Troll amalgams and troll mutates are two examples of such strangely mutated forms.": "巨魔们的快速愈合使它们容易受到奇怪的变异影响，特别是当它们在异常环境中再生或从特殊的魔法伤口中愈合时。巨魔混合体和巨魔变异体就是这种奇异变异形态的两个例子。",
	"I'll just keep reminding myself that the gods delight in the variety of their creations, new wonders are revealed every day, and the multiverse is much larger than I can imagine. And that's a good thing!": "我会不断提醒自己，神灵喜欢他们创造物种的多样性，每天都会揭示新的奇迹，而多元宇宙远比我能想象的要大得多。而这是一件好事！",
	"Excellent. But these trolls are loathsome.": "太棒了。但这些巨魔真讨厌。"
