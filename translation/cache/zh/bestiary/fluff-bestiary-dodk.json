If I had proper facilities and resources, unimaginable power would be mine.": "紫晶学院不理解我的方法，但如果我被琐碎的道德和无用的伦理所束缚，我就无法揭开狂热的秘密。如果我有适当的设施和资源，无法想象的力量将属于我。",

	"I hold vindictive grudges against everyone who ever wronged me. I'll have my revenge someday, but I fear acting against those with more power or resources than me. I must hide for now, as I'm terrified the Academy will send assassins to kill me and steal my brilliant research.": "我对所有曾经冤枉过我的人怀有复仇的怨恨。总有一天我会报仇，但我害怕对那些比我有更多权力或资源的人采取行动。我现在必须隐藏起来，因为我害怕学院会派刺客来杀我，窃取我的卓越研究。",

	"Friedrich Von Lichten ambitiously explored the mutagenic effects of delerium after Drakkenheim's destruction, and was among the first to fully describe the effects of eldritch {@adventure contamination|DoDk|12} upon the human body. He was ejected from the Amethyst Academy when it was discovered he was using apprentices as test subjects. So grave was his trespass, that the Academy notified the Silver Order of his existence, putting a death bounty on his head. Both The Silver Order and the Amethyst Academy have been searching for him since.": "弗里德里希·冯·利希滕（Friedrich Von Lichten）在德拉肯海姆（Drakkenheim）被摧毁后雄心勃勃地探索了癫狂的变异效应，并且是最早完整描述了奥术{@adventure contamination|DoDk|12}对人体的影响之一。当发现他将学徒用作试验对象时，他被从紫晶学院（Amethyst Academy）驱逐出去。他的罪行如此严重，以至于学院通知了白银骑士团（Silver Order）他的存在，并悬赏捉拿他。自那时起，白银骑士团和紫晶学院一直在寻找他。",
	"Witness my power, understand that I am the future. Some may call me a god, and I would not correct them.": "见证我的力量，明白我就是未来。有些人可能会称我为一个神，而我也不会纠正他们。",
	"We must embrace the Haze, and allow {@adventure contamination|DoDk|12} to change us, make us better.": "我们必须拥抱(`Haze`)，并允许{@adventure contamination|DoDk|12}改变我们，让我们变得更好。",

	"It is not enough that I merely outsmart my foes, they must be shown their weakness and failure.": "我不仅仅要智胜我的敌人，还要让他们看到他们的弱点和失败。",
	"Friedrich von Lichten has fully embraced {@adventure contamination|DoDk|12} and transformed into a monster, and is now the Pale Man (see Appendix A of{@i Dungeons of Drakkenheim}for game statistics). He has maintained his intellect, and drapes his hunched and withered figure in a black cloak. Beneath his paper-thin skin are wriggling and writhing things. His lidless eyes are sunken, his teeth are prominent, yellowing and decaying. One can just make out a sickly green tongue that darts out when he speaks. He talks in a stunted, almost exasperated tone.": "弗里德里希·冯·利希滕已完全拥抱{@adventure contamination|DoDk|12}，变成了一个怪物，现在是苍白人(见{@i Dungeons of Drakkenheim}附录A中的游戏统计数据)。他保持了他的智慧，披着一件黑色斗篷，驼背而枯瘦。在他薄如纸张的皮肤下，有着蠕动和扭曲的东西。他那没有眼皮的眼睛深陷，牙齿突出，泛黄而腐烂。当他说话时，可以看到一条病态的绿色舌头不时探出。他说话时语气受阻，几乎显得恼怒。",
	"He presents his estate as a safehouse for the lost and forgotten.": "他将他的庄园呈现为一个供迷失和被遗忘者避难的地方。",
	"The Pale Man sows the rumours that he can help contaminated people so he can use them as test subjects for his experiments. When he meets a transformed or contaminated creature, he presents himself as a helpful expert, offering to treat any individual left in his care. He never actually cures {@adventure contamination|DoDk|12}, but sometimes helps other transformed monsters become somewhat lucid so he can make better use of them as minions. The Pale Man spends most of his time in the repurposed master bedroom of the estate he uses as his laboratory, and gives orders only to his most trusted thralls.": "苍白人散布谣言称他可以帮助被污染的人，以便将他们用作他实验的试验对象。当他遇到一个变异或被污染的生物时，他会表现得像一个乐于助人的专家，提供治疗并留下照顾。他从未真正治愈{@adventure contamination|DoDk|12}，但有时会帮助其他变异怪物变得有些清醒，以便更好地利用他们作为手下。苍白人大部分时间都在他用作实验室的庄园主卧室里度过，并只向他最信任的奴隶下达命令。",
	"Occasionally, a creature's rapid mutations become too much for its body to withstand. In a horrific shower of gore, such wretches explode into a quivering mass of cancerous tumors, babbling mouths, shifting eyes, and grasping limbs that twist, expand, and retract in grotesque and bizarre ways.": "偶尔，生物的快速突变变得对其身体来说太过剧烈。在一场可怕的血肉之雨中，这样的可怜家伙们爆炸成了一团颤抖的癌症肿瘤、喋喋不休的嘴巴、移动的眼睛和伸展的四肢，以怪诞和奇异的方式扭曲、膨胀和收缩。",
	"Who I am is not as important as what I am. I am quicker than thought, more silent than contemplation, more slippery than a fading memory, and more unshakable than a guilty conscience. I deal in secrets and mendacity as lesser thieves deal in coins and larceny. I can fulfil your wildest dreams, or I can be your worst nightmare.": "我是谁并不重要，重要的是我是什么。我比思想更快，比沉思更寂静，比逝去的记忆更滑溜，比内疚的良心更坚不可摧。我处理秘密和虚伪，就像小偷处理硬币和盗窃一样。我可以实现你最疯狂的梦想，也可以成为你最糟糕的噩梦。",
	"The Queen of Thieves is a scheming mastermind who controls the Drakkenheim underworld. She has transformed a hundred squabbling bands of brigands and outlaws into a burgeoning criminal empire. However, none know her true identity or origin, for she wears many faces. Though she is most infamously encountered as a lithe masked woman garbed in swashbuckling attire with a wide-brimmed hat and jewelled rapier, the Queen of Thieves adopts a variety of costumes, facial features, skin and hair colours, body shapes, ages, and genders depending on her mood and circumstances. As such, she typically confirms her identity by revealing some secret about whoever she is speaking with or demonstrating her uncanny ability to change appearance seemingly at-will.": "盗贼女王是一个阴险的主谋，控制着德拉肯海姆的地下世界。她已经将一百个争吵不休的强盗和逃犯团伙转变成了一个蓬勃发展的犯罪帝国。然而，没有人知道她的真实身份或起源，因为她有许多面孔。尽管她最臭名昭著的形象是一位身穿冒险服装、戴着宽檐帽和镶有宝石的西洋剑的纤细面具女子，但盗贼女王会根据自己的心情和环境采用各种服装、面部特征、肤色和头发颜色、体形、年龄和性别。因此，她通常通过揭示与她交谈的人的一些秘密或展示她惊人的随意变相能力来确认自己的身份。",
	"I am never caught unprepared, and have contingencies for my contingencies. I speak with rakish confidence while casually exposing everything I know about others, and flaunt my ability to be anybody or anywhere.": "我从不措手不及，对我的备用方案也有备用方案。我以轻浮的自信谈论他人的一切，展示我能够成为任何人或出现在任何地方的能力。",
	"I indulge in playing mind games and manipulating people with the promise of profit. Instead of spilling blood, I spill secrets. My enemies are worthless as corpses. When I have to steal lives, I spend them dearly first.": "我沉迷于玩心理游戏并通过利润的承诺操纵人们。我不是流血，而是泄露秘密。我的敌人如同无价值的尸体。当我不得不夺取生命时，我会先花费它们。",
	"Law is powerless in the chaos of the ruins. As long as anarchy reigns, so shall I.": "在废墟的混乱中，法律是无能为力的。只要无政府主义统治，我也将如此。",

	"Few amongst the Queen's Men have met the Queen of Thieves in person, and even fewer have attended the Court of Thieves. Most only know if they get a note attached to a Queen of Diamonds playing card, you better do what it says.": "女王的人中很少有人亲自见过(女贼之后)女贼女王，甚至更少的人参加过(女贼之后)女贼法庭。大多数人只知道，如果他们收到一张附有方块女王扑克牌的便条，最好照做。",
	"This ratling stands head-and-shoulders over the others, and has black-brown fur and a wicked grin - some of his frontmost teeth are delerium crystals. He wears scavenged bits of light armour, tattered dark blue rags, and a gold crown which is slightly too small for his head.": "这只鼠人站在其他人的头顶，拥有黑褐色的毛发和邪恶的笑容 - 他前面的一些牙齿是狂喜水晶。他穿着拼凑而成的轻甲，破烂的深蓝色布料，以及一顶略微太小的金冠。",
	"A pair of glinting yellow-purple eyes appear down the dark tunnel ahead, then another, then more. A scurrying mass of furry bodies bound up in mud-spattered cloth and greasy leather surge forward. Their rodent-like claws brandish rust-caked blades as many squeaking voices erupt into a cacophony of chittering, chirping, screeching, and finally a howl of \"Kill! Kill! Kill!\"": "一双闪闪发光的黄紫色眼睛出现在前方黑暗的隧道中，然后又一双，再多。一群毛茸茸的身体裹着泥污布和油腻皮革的急速前行。它们类似啮齿动物的爪子挥舞着生锈的刀片，许多尖叫声汇成了一片刺耳的吱吱声、啾啾声、尖叫声，最后爆发出一声“杀！杀！杀！”的嚎叫。",
	"Ratlings are oversized mutated rats imbued with malevolent cunning and driven by a mad compulsion to consume and multiply. These wretched monsters suffer from a constant internal struggle between cowardly survival instincts and violent impulsive urges. Ratlings dream of eating everything, and will eat anything, but love eating people. They especially love eating babies. While they will subsist on carrion, ratlings take captives back to their lairs so they can have fresh food later. Thousands of ratlings dwell in the city. They form warring colonies that dig maze-like burrows featuring multiple entrances and tight looping passages. Successful colonies grow in number quickly, as ratlings mature in a matter of weeks when ample food and delerium are available.": "大鼠人是超大型变异老鼠，具有邪恶的狡诈，并受到疯狂的驱使，不断地消耗和繁殖。这些可怜的怪物在怯懦的生存本能和暴力的冲动之间不断挣扎。大鼠人梦想着吃掉一切，什么都吃，但最喜欢吃人。他们尤其喜欢吃婴儿。虽然它们可以靠食腐肉维持生存，但大鼠人会把俘虏带回它们的巢穴，这样它们以后就能有新鲜的食物。成千上万的大鼠人居住在城市中。它们组成了战争部落，挖掘出迷宫般的地道，设有多个入口和紧密的弯曲通道。成功的部落会迅速增长，因为只要有充足的食物和狂喜，大鼠人几周内就会成熟。",

	"Many ratlings worship a fiendish entity they call the Rat God. They construct crude effigies to the Rat God, who whispers to the most cunning and intelligent ratlings, granting them magic through eldritch pacts. Ratlings understand surprisingly little about the Rat God, and make up stories and fables about the Rat God's exploits.": "许多鼠人崇拜一个被称为鼠神的邪恶实体。他们制作粗糙的雕像供奉鼠神，鼠神会对最狡猾和聪明的鼠人耳语，通过奥术契约赐予他们魔法。鼠人对鼠神的了解惊人地少，他们编造关于鼠神壮举的故事和寓言。",
