	"If Vecna is slain, his soul refuses to accept its fate and lives on as a disembodied spirit that fashions a new body for itself after {@dice 1d100} years. Vecna's soul can fashion a new body even if its old body was burned to ash or otherwise obliterated. When the new body is complete, Vecna regains all his hit points and becomes active again. Vecna's new body appears anywhere within 100 miles of where Vecna was slain.": "如果Vecna被杀，他的灵魂拒绝接受自己的命运，并作为一个没有实体的灵魂继续生存，在{@dice 1d100}年后为自己塑造一个新的身体。Vecna的灵魂可以塑造一个新的身体，即使它的旧身体被烧成灰烬或以其他方式被抹去。当新的身体完成后，Vecna恢复了他所有的命中率并再次变得活跃。Vecna的新身体会出现在Vecna被杀死的地方100英里范围内。",

	"{@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d4 + 5}) piercing damage, plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it is afflicted by entropic magic, taking 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns.

	"Vecna conjures a torrent of flying, spectral entities that fill a 120-foot cone and pass through all creatures in that area before dissipating. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 36 ({@damage 8d8}) necrotic damage and is {@condition frightened} of Vecna for 1 minute.

The {@creature zombie} is under Vecna's control.": "Vecna使坏死的魔法吞噬他能看到的120英尺内的一个生物。目标必须做一个{@dc 22}宪法救赎，如果救赎失败，将受到96({@damage 8d8 + 60})的坏死伤害，如果救赎成功，将受到一半的伤害。被这个魔法杀死的人形生物会在Vecna的下一个回合开始时上升为{@creature zombie}，并在主动权顺序中紧随Vecna之后行动。这个{@creature zombie}是在Vecna的控制之下。"
