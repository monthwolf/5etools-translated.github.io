	"Angels are mysterious, detached beings seldom glimpsed by mortal eyes. They are the living incarnations of white mana, and embody its inherent tendencies toward order and harmony. Some inventors view angels in the context of the Aether Cycle as an expression of a Great Design. Given divine inspiration and an utterly perfect stage of innovation, an angel is the constructed result—a living invention. Their masks, headdresses, and armor give them an almost mechanical appearance, but they are living beings with brightly colored skin almost entirely concealed beneath their armor and decorative robes. Because of their perfection, angels are believed to be immune to the final stages of the Aether Cycle, which would involve their destruction.": "天使是神秘的、超脱的生命，很少被凡人的眼睛瞥见。他们是白法力的活体化身，体现了其固有的秩序与和谐的倾向。一些发明家认为，在乙太循环的背景下，天使是一个伟大设计的表达。鉴于神圣的灵感和完全完美的创新阶段，天使是构建的结果--活的发明。他们的面具、头饰和盔甲给了他们一个几乎是机械的外观，但他们是活生生的人，鲜艳的皮肤几乎完全隐藏在他们的盔甲和装饰性长袍之下。由于他们的完美性，天使被认为对乙太循环的最后阶段具有免疫力，这将涉及到他们的毁灭。",
	"The people of Kaladesh do not worship angels or beseech their intervention in mortal affairs, and such prayers would go unheard anyway. The solitary angels interact with each other only in formal, nuanced rituals whose meanings are obscure. But the sight of an angel is thought to be a good omen, and in particular, it is believed to presage success with invention.": "卡拉德什的人们不崇拜天使，也不祈求他们干预凡人的事务，反正这样的祈祷是不会被听到的。孤独的天使们只在正式的、细微的仪式中相互交流，其含义不甚明了。但人们认为看到天使是一个好兆头，特别是，人们相信它预示着发明的成功。",
	"The term \"construct\" encompasses a tremendous variety of artifact creatures. Some are automatons designed for battle—most often to fight each other in arenas, but also in real combat. Many of these battle constructs specialize in defense, sometimes carrying shields to protect their creators, or simply escorting their charges like a watchdog.": "\"构筑物 \"一词包含了种类繁多的神器生物。有些是为战斗而设计的自动机--最常见的是在竞技场上互相厮杀，但也有真正的战斗。这些战斗构装体中有许多专门从事防御工作，有时携带盾牌以保护它们的创造者，或者只是像看门狗一样护送它们的指控。",
	"Many constructs are intended for use in foundries and workshops, assisting inventors or performing repetitive tasks. Such a construct might find and deliver a specific tool its inventor requests, or perform routine maintenance in parts of a foundry that are difficult or dangerous to reach.": "许多构件旨在用于铸造厂和车间，协助发明者或执行重复性任务。这样的结构体可能会找到并交付其发明者所要求的特定工具，或者在铸造厂中难以到达或有危险的部分进行日常维护。",
	"Other constructs have been designed to carry messages or packages, to load and unload goods from barges and airships, to trawl the sewers for salvageable materials, and even—during the height of the Aether Revolt—to scan crowds of people for known renegades and fugitives, recognizing their facial features.": "其他构造物被设计用来携带信息或包裹，从驳船和飞艇上装卸货物，在下水道中搜寻可回收的材料，甚至在乙醚起义的高峰期，扫描人群中已知的叛徒和逃亡者，识别他们的面部特征。",
	"Demons are artificial creatures, carefully constructed and imbued with aether according to a pattern called the Dark Schematic. Unknown artificers of the ancient past devised this blueprint—perhaps in an attempt to imitate the angels, or possibly to replicate native demons that have since been hunted to extinction. Just as angels embody white mana and the construction phase of the Aether Cycle, demons are ravenous incarnations of black mana that feast on aether. They raid night markets, pillage airships, and break into refinement plants seeking aether to slake their thirst, causing as much destruction as possible in the process. They can thus be imagined as an embodiment of the reclamation stage of the Aether Cycle.": "恶魔是人造的生物，根据一种被称为 \"黑暗原理 \"的模式精心建造并注入乙太。古代未知的工匠们设计了这个蓝图--也许是为了模仿天使，也可能是为了复制那些后来被猎杀到灭绝的本地恶魔。就像天使体现了白法力和乙太循环的构建阶段，恶魔是黑法力的贪婪化身，以乙太为食。他们袭击夜市，掠夺飞艇，闯入炼油厂寻求乙太来解渴，在这个过程中造成尽可能多的破坏。因此，他们可以被想象为乙太循环的开垦阶段的一个体现。",
	"Artificers execute the Dark Schematic only in great desperation, often in the course of seeking power for themselves or revenge against their enemies. The destructive might of demons is hard to control, though, and these creatures have no particular regard for or gratitude toward their creators. As often as not, even an inventor who performs the steps necessary to create a demon with the utmost care suffers the same dismal fate as all its other victims.": "工匠们只有在非常绝望的情况下才会执行黑暗示意图，通常是在为自己寻求力量或对敌人进行报复的过程中。不过，恶魔的破坏力是很难控制的，这些生物对它们的创造者没有特别的尊重和感激之情。通常情况下，即使一个发明家以最谨慎的态度完成了创造恶魔的必要步骤，也会像其他受害者一样遭受同样的悲惨命运。",
	"Dragons are the apex predators of the skies. They are usually found in rural areas, avoiding the crowds of air ships and thopters found above the cities of Kaladesh. Their favorite prey are the sky whales that drift through the aethersphere, but they also hunt leviathans, wurms, hydras, drakes, giants—and airships.": "龙是天空中的顶级掠食者。它们通常出现在农村地区，避开卡拉德斯城市上空众多的航空船和直升机。它们最喜欢的猎物是漂浮在太虚空中的天鲸，但它们也猎杀雷神、巫妖、水怪、德拉克、巨人和飞艇。",
	"Dragons typically hunt by perching on a promonto ry or hilltop, remaining perfectly still as they wait for prey to come into view. With a single snap of its pow erful wings, a dragon can launch itself into the air with lightning speed, hurtling toward its target like a deadly arrow.": "龙通常通过栖息在山顶上，在等待猎物进入视野时保持完全静止。只要一拍强大的翅膀，龙就能以闪电般的速度飞向空中，像一支致命的箭一样飞向目标。",
	"Dragons resemble a cross between a lizard and a tiger, with powerful feline bodies covered in striped fur, reptilian heads crowned with long horns, and enormous leathery wings that propel them through the sky at tre mendous speed. Their chests are adorned with elabo rate patterns resembling fine filigree.": "龙类似于蜥蜴和老虎的混合体，有强大的猫科动物身体，覆盖着条纹毛皮，爬行动物的头部有长角，巨大的皮革翅膀推动它们以惊人的速度穿过天空。它们的胸部装饰着类似于细丝的精灵图案。",
	"Drakes are skittish, opportunistic predators that hunt the skies of Kaladesh in units called rushes, made up of as many as a dozen drakes. Though they prey mostly on birds, they can also be seen clinging to the hides of leviathans and whales, picking off winged leeches and other parasites and scavengers that attach themselves to the huge sky beasts. Occasionally, a rush of drakes will descend on a herd of mountain goats or other game found at high elevations.": "德拉克斯是一种胆小的、投机取巧的捕食者，它们在卡拉德斯的天空中捕食的单位被称为 \"群\"，由十几只德拉克斯组成。虽然它们主要捕食鸟类，但也可以看到它们依附在利维坦和鲸鱼的皮上，捡拾附着在巨大的天空巨兽身上的带翅膀的水蛭和其他寄生虫和食腐动物。偶尔，一群鸭子会冲向山羊群或其他在高海拔地区发现的猎物。",
	"Drakes have reptilian bodies and large, leathery wings. They use the sharp claws on their two legs to cling to rocky crags, whales, or leviathans, as well as to grasp and tear at larger prey. Drakes are highly territori al, and have been known to attack airships from time to time. A drake is intelligent enough to recognize specific airships that have killed other members of its rush, and drake harassment often forces such ships to find new routes to avoid a rush's territory.": "德拉克斯有爬行动物的身体和大的、皮质的翅膀。它们用两只脚上锋利的爪子紧紧抓住岩石峭壁、鲸鱼或陆地动物，以及抓取和撕咬较大的猎物。德雷克的领地意识很强，据说它们会不时地攻击飞艇。德雷克有足够的智慧来识别那些杀死了它的其他成员的飞艇，而德雷克的骚扰常常迫使这些飞艇寻找新的路线，以避开它的领土。",
	"Standing twenty to thirty feet tall, giants are towering bipedal creatures that follow the flow of aether on regular migratory routes. Once they start moving, they build both momentum and a single-mindedness that makes them nearly impossible to stop. Anything in their path, whether it's a building or a force of soldiers, is crushed without thought.": "巨人站在20到30英尺高的地方，是高耸的双足生物，在定期迁移的路线上跟随乙太的流动。一旦它们开始移动，它们就会产生动力，并且一心一意，使它们几乎无法停止。任何挡在它们面前的东西，无论是建筑物还是士兵，都会被不经意地碾碎。",
	"Giants eat whatever they happen across in the course of their migrations, which includes many other creatures drawn to the aether flow. They are beings of pure aggressive instinct, but without a hint of malice. In all likelihood, giants aren't intelligent enough to wish harm on anyone or anything. Still, the combination of their regular migrations and their sheer destructive power makes these creatures a menace.": "巨人吃他们在迁徙过程中偶然遇到的任何东西，其中包括许多被乙太流吸引的其他生物。他们是纯粹的攻击性本能的生命，但没有一丝的恶意。在所有的可能性中，巨人并没有聪明到希望伤害任何人或事物。然而，他们定期的迁徙和他们纯粹的破坏力相结合，使这些生物成为一种威胁。",
	"Any structure built along one of their migratory paths is sure to be destroyed unless special accommodations are made. The zone of Giant's Walk in Ghirapur was designed by the city's engineers and edificers to include such accommodations, including rotating platforms, shifting bridges, and adjustable canal locks that provide the giants a clear and easy pathway during their biannual migration through the city.": "沿着它们的迁徙路线之一建造的任何建筑都肯定会被摧毁，除非做出特殊的安排。吉拉普尔的巨人漫步区是由该市的工程师和建筑商设计的，其中包括旋转平台、可移动的桥梁和可调节的运河水闸，在巨人一年两次的迁徙过程中为它们提供了一条清晰而便捷的通道。",
	"Gremlins are tenacious scavengers with an insatiable appetite for aether. They are drawn to places with abundant supplies of aether, including laboratories and workshops, where they can destroy months of careful work in a matter of hours. A small infestation of gremlins can easily end an inventor's career—and in sufficient numbers, these creatures could obliterate the aether infrastructure of a city like Ghirapur. Although the Consulate has extensive programs to prevent and control gremlin infestations, it often seems as though the city of wonders is just one gremlin away from a large-scale blackout and complete shutdown.": "小妖精是顽强的清道夫，对乙太有着永不满足的胃口。它们被吸引到有丰富乙太供应的地方，包括实验室和车间，在那里它们可以在几个小时内摧毁几个月的精心工作。一小群小精灵可以轻易地结束一个发明家的职业生涯--如果数量足够多，这些生物可以抹去像Ghirapur这样的城市的乙太基础设施。尽管领事馆有广泛的计划来预防和控制小精灵的侵扰，但这个充满奇迹的城市似乎只差一个小精灵就会发生大规模停电和完全关闭。",
	"Gremlins are small, hairless creatures with six legs and long snouts. Each leg is tipped with hard, dense claws that are perfect for slicing and shredding through rock and wood in natural environments—as well as metal and machinery in more urban areas. Gremlins can also use their claws to climb, to widen holes and tunnels, and to pull themselves through cramped spaces.": "小妖精是一种小型、无毛的生物，有六条腿和长鼻子。每条腿上都有坚硬而密集的爪子，非常适合在自然环境中切割和粉碎岩石和木材，以及在更多的城市地区切割和粉碎金属和机器。小精灵还可以用它们的爪子来攀爬，扩大洞和隧道，并把自己拉过狭窄的空间。",
	"Hellions appear similar to wurms, though the two creatures are unrelated. A hellion has a long, segmented body like that of a centipede, with innumerable short legs that propel it above or below ground. Its huge, toothy maw is surrounded by anywhere from six to twelve long appendages resembling clawed fingers, which it uses to grasp and pull prey to its mouth. Hellions are found in mountainous areas, where they burst up from the rocky ground to ambush their prey.": "地狱龙看起来与巫妖相似，尽管这两种生物没有关系。地狱龙有一个像蜈蚣一样的长条形身体，有无数条短腿，可以在地上或地下推动它。它巨大的、长满牙齿的嘴周围有六到十二根长长的附肢，类似于爪状的手指，它用这些附肢来抓取和拉动猎物到它的嘴边。蛇龙被发现在山区，在那里它们从岩石中冲出，伏击它们的猎物。",
	"Hydras are giant lizards resembling iguanas, with multiple heads set atop long, snakelike necks. Aether traces whorling patterns through their scales, shapes the crests running down their necks and tails, and glows blue within the skin under their chins. Most hydras have five or six heads, but small hydras with as few as three heads—as well as enormous specimens with eight or more—have been seen in the deep forests far from Ghirapur.": "水蛇是类似鬣蜥的巨型蜥蜴，有多个头，长长的蛇形脖子上。乙太在它们的鳞片上描画出漩涡状的图案，塑造出它们脖子和尾巴上的纹路，并在它们下巴的皮肤上发出蓝色的光芒。大多数水蛇有五个或六个头，但只有三个头的小水蛇，以及八个或更多的巨大标本，都曾在远离吉拉普尔的深林中出现过。",
	"Hydras are fierce predators, favoring prey that has absorbed large quantities of aether from the environment. This taste for aether also leads them to devour aether-powered machines whenever they encounter such devices, from thopters to automatons. In the remote wilderness near Peema where hydras are plentiful, such altercations are rarely an issue. But in the rare event of a hydra coming too close to civilization—or even wandering into one of Ghirapur's greenbelts—they can cause widespread destruction in their hunt for aether.": "水蛇是凶猛的掠食者，喜欢从环境中吸收大量的乙太的猎物。这种对乙太的喜好也导致它们在遇到乙太驱动的机器时，从thopters到自动装置，都会吞噬掉。在Peema附近的偏远荒野，水蛇大量存在，这种争吵很少发生。但如果九头蛇离文明太近，甚至误入Ghirapur的绿化带，它们就会在猎取乙太的过程中造成广泛的破坏。",
	"Servos are tiny constructs that function as personal assistants. They are often seen perched on the shoulders of their inventors, acting as a fashion statement as well as a useful extra hand. Servos are small enough to be grasped in one hand, with tiny gears providing impressive motive force from a small aether supply. They rarely stray far from their inventor-masters, but they can be sent to carry messages or perform similar tasks.": "伺服机是一种微小的构造，作为个人助理发挥作用。它们经常被看到栖息在发明者的肩膀上，既是一种时尚的标志，也是一只有用的额外的手。伺服机小到可以用一只手握住，微小的齿轮通过一个小的乙醚供应提供令人印象深刻的动力。它们很少远离它们的发明者主人，但它们可以被派去携带信息或执行类似的任务。",
	"The aethersphere is home to its own ecosystem. Tiny organisms float in the aether currents, deriving all their energy from it and serving as food for larger creatures. Leviathans (similar in form to enormous eels) and flying whales filter these organisms out of the air as they swim through the aethersphere. The whales, as a rule, are not hostile by nature, though they can cause devastating sparks or destructive storms as they move through the aether flows. But leviathans are perpetually hungry, and feed on drakes and airships just as readily as they do on smaller creatures. Along with dragons, leviathans are the primary reason that aether-mining airships carry enormous harpoons.": "乙醚球是它自己的生态系统的家园。微小的生物体漂浮在乙太流中，从乙太流中获取所有的能量，并作为大型生物的食物。Leviathans（类似于巨大的鳗鱼）和飞鲸在游过乙太圈时从空气中过滤这些生物。鲸鱼，作为一项规则，本质上是没有敌意的，尽管它们在通过乙太流时可以引起毁灭性的火花或破坏性的风暴。但鲸鱼永远是饥饿的，它们以德拉克和飞艇为食，就像它们以小型生物为食一样容易。与龙一起，利维坦是乙太采矿飞艇携带巨大鱼叉的主要原因。",
	"A sky leviathan is similar to a purple worm in its propensity to swallow prey whole, but it lacks the worm's poison stinger and is therefore significantly less dangerous. Use the statistics presented here. Sky whales are generally docile filter-feeders that avoid confrontations with airships and flying predators whenever possible.": "天空利维坦在吞食猎物的倾向上与紫色蠕虫相似，但它缺乏蠕虫的毒刺，因此危险性明显降低。使用这里的统计数据。天鲸通常是温顺的滤食动物，尽可能避免与飞艇和飞行掠食者发生对抗。",
	"Thopters are small automatons that fly using some combination of whirling rotors and stretched-fabric wings. They are ubiquitous in Ghirapur and other settlements, where they carry messages like carrier pigeons, hunt gremlins like trained hawks, race each other in friendly and not-so-friendly competitions—and serve as remote viewing devices for Consulate authorities and crime lords alike. Thopters range from the size of pigeons to the size of eagles, with extremely intricate gearwork usually partly visible beneath glass orbs and filigree.": "Thopters是小型自动机，利用旋转的转子和拉伸的织物翅膀的某种组合飞行。它们在吉拉普尔和其他定居点无处不在，它们像信鸽一样传递信息，像训练有素的老鹰一样猎杀小精灵，在友好和不友好的竞争中相互较量，并作为领事馆当局和犯罪头目的远程观察设备使用。Thopters的大小从鸽子到老鹰都有，极其复杂的齿轮装置通常在玻璃球和金属丝下部分可见。",
	"Wurms are enormous, legless creatures that burrow under the forests, mountains, and plains of Kaladesh, and which can exceed fifty feet in length when fully grown. A wurm devours everything in its path—flora, fauna, and inanimate objects alike—with a gaping maw containing multiple rings of sharp teeth and grinding plates. Rumor has it that at least one wurm tunnels beneath the large, lush park in Ghirapur called the Cowl, accounting for at least some of the mysterious disappearances there.": "沃玛是一种巨大的无腿生物，在卡拉德斯的森林、山脉和平原下钻来钻去，完全长大后长度可以超过50英尺。巫妖会吞噬一切，包括植物、动物和无生命的物体，它的大嘴里有多圈尖锐的牙齿和研磨板。有传言说，至少有一只巫妖在吉拉普尔的大型郁郁葱葱的公园下面挖地道，这至少是那里的一些神秘失踪事件的原因。",
	"Both the colored scales of a wurm's skin and the winding patterns of its tunnels mimic the flow of aether through the sky. Some elf aether-seers believe that these tunnels reveal a deep connection between wurms and aether, and they explore wurm burrows in the hope of developing a similar connection. It is said that a wurm never doubles back along its own path, so following those paths is less dangerous than it might seem. However, the existence of a single wurm in an area suggests that others might be nearby, and wurm tunnels do cross each other—so not all these brave aether-seers return. Those who do are said to gain insights that they find difficult to express to others.": "沃尔姆皮肤上的彩色鳞片和它的隧道的蜿蜒模式都模仿了天空中的乙醚流。一些精灵的乙醚观察家相信，这些隧道揭示了巫妖和乙醚之间的深层联系，他们探索巫妖的洞穴，希望能建立类似的联系。据说，一个巫妖从来不会沿着自己的道路折返，所以沿着这些道路走下去没有想象中那么危险。然而，一个地区存在一只巫妖，就意味着附近可能还有其他巫妖，而且巫妖的隧道会相互交叉，所以并不是所有这些勇敢的太虚观者都能回来。那些回来的人据说会获得他们难以向他人表达的见解。"
