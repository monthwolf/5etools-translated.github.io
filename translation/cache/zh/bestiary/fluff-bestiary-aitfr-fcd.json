	"These mercenaries stand for the Banner of Blades and the Iron Lions at Tyreus's fortress, but they might not be representative of those armies. These are rank-and-file warriors capable of demonstrating coordinated attacks and formations. They are neither the most capable lieutenants nor the rough-andtumble masses of these small armies.": "这些雇佣兵代表刀旗和提洛斯要塞的铁狮军，但他们可能不是这些军队的代表。这些是能够展示协调攻击和阵型的普通战士。他们既不是最能干的副将，也不是这些小军队中粗制滥造的群众。",
	"For the purposes of their Inspired Courage feature, the mercenaries of both companies consider each other allies while at the fortress—unless the adventurers do something to drive them apart.": "为了激发勇气的目的，两个公司的雇佣兵在要塞时都认为对方是盟友--除非冒险家们做了什么事把他们分开。",
	"When he was young, living in the vast, internecine planar city of Ravnica, Tyreus's parents, Tyberio and Ayraea, forbade him from pursuing any study of magic or wizardry. They didn't want Tyreus embroiled in a life of danger and skullduggery—as was common in Ravnica. But Tyreus came to understand that at least part of his father's motive for forbidding magic was Tyberio's own rebellion against his adventurous parents. When he learned that his grandmother had once been a powerful mage, Tyreus wanted to follow in her footsteps.": "当他年轻的时候，生活在广阔的、自相残杀的平面城市Ravnica，Tyreus的父母，Tyberio和Ayraea，禁止他追求任何魔法或巫术的研究。他们不希望泰勒斯卷入危险和恶作剧的生活中--这在拉夫尼卡很常见。但泰勒斯开始明白，他父亲禁止魔法的动机中至少有一部分是泰贝里欧自己对他冒险的父母的叛逆。当他得知他的祖母曾经是一个强大的法师时，泰瑞欧想追随她的脚步。",
	"Tyreus has always wanted to be distinctive, admired, and powerful. He saw magic as a way to achieve a greatness he felt Tyberio had tried to deny him. In secret, Tyreus sought out ways to learn magic, but as he was forced to hide his ambition and his studies, he found cohorts in the worst places. Evil mages stoked his hunger for power and eroded his conscience.": "泰瑞乌斯一直想成为与众不同、受人敬仰和强大的人。他把魔法看作是实现他觉得泰贝里欧试图剥夺他的伟大的一种方式。秘密地，泰勒斯寻找学习魔法的方法，但由于他被迫隐藏自己的野心和研究，他在最糟糕的地方找到了同伙。邪恶的法师激起了他对权力的渴望，侵蚀了他的良知。",
	"Tyreus went months without speaking to his parents. Before he even knew they were sick, Tyberio and Ayraea passed away. Furious at his inability to help them—and their silent stubbornness—Tyreus sought the kind of power that would help him create places he could control. First, he studied the magic of illusions. He thought he could create illusions so real that he could live within them, fool others, and thus control his own destiny. Then he found another possibility.": "泰勒斯有好几个月没有和他的父母说话。在他知道他们生病之前，泰贝里欧和艾蕾雅就已经去世了。对自己无法帮助他们--以及他们沉默的固执感到愤怒--泰勒斯寻求那种能帮助他创造他能控制的地方的力量。首先，他研究了幻觉的魔法。他认为他可以创造出如此真实的幻象，以至于他可以生活在其中，欺骗他人，从而控制自己的命运。然后他发现了另一种可能性。",
	"In journals Tyberio had hidden from him, written by Tyberio's mother, the wizard Sylvene, Tyreus found tales of the Stone of Creation, an artifact capable of creating places and structures seemingly from the imagination alone. Tyreus thus sought out everything he could learn about Sylvene and the Stone, leading him to another world—Faerûn—and the remote Highstar Lake, where the Stone was lost long ago.": "在泰贝里欧藏起来的日记中，泰贝里欧的母亲，巫师西尔维尼写的，泰勒斯发现了关于创造之石的故事，这是一件能够创造地方和结构的神器，似乎只靠想象力。因此，Tyreus寻找他能了解到的关于Sylvene和创世之石的一切，并将他带到了另一个世界--Faerûn--以及遥远的Highstar湖，创世之石在很久以前就丢失了。",
	"It may be too late for Tyreus. He has devoted himself to his own grandeur now and lost sight of why he wanted power in the first place. He doesn't want to help anyone but himself. He sees those who would help him or share in his ambitions as threats to his own power. He doesn't want approval or alliances; he wants subservience. Whether he realizes it or not, he doesn't care whom he hurts to get what he wants.": "对推罗来说，这可能太晚了。他现在已经全身心地投入到自己的宏伟事业中，而忘记了他当初为什么想要权力。他不想帮助任何人，只想帮助自己。他把那些愿意帮助他或分享他的野心的人视为对他自己权力的威胁。他不想要认可或联盟；他想要服从。无论他是否意识到这一点，他不在乎为了得到他想要的东西而伤害谁。",
	"\"I laugh to buy myself time to think, even though my gut instincts are often better than most people's calculated efforts.\"": "\"我笑是为了给自己争取思考的时间，尽管我的直觉往往比大多数人的计算努力要好。\"",
	"\"Power. People try to take things from me, to limit or deny me, but I don't allow it. Real power is deciding other people's fates.\"": "\"权力。人们试图从我这里夺走东西，限制或否定我，但我不允许这样。真正的权力是决定其他人的命运。\"",
	"\"I'll make time for other people when I have a kingdom to call my own. Then I'll know who I can trust: the people who don't get in my way.\"": "\"当我有一个属于我自己的王国时，我会为其他人腾出时间。然后我就知道我可以信任谁：那些不妨碍我的人。\"",
	"\"I have a bad temper. Why can't people see I know what I'm doing?\"": "\"我有一个坏脾气。为什么人们看不到我知道自己在做什么？\""
