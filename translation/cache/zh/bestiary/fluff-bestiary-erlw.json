Over decades, a high priest named Malevanor worked with the necromancers of the Blood of Vol to develop the Odakyr Rites, which grant Karrnathi undead the ability to make tactical decisions and operate without direct guidance.": "最初，这些骷髅和僵尸需要不断的控制，并充当炮灰。几十年来，一位名叫Malevanor的大祭司与沃尔之血的死灵法师合作开发了奥达克尔仪式，该仪式赋予了卡尔纳特的亡灵在没有直接指导的情况下做出战术决策和行动的能力。",
	"The Odakyr Rites work only when performed on the remains of a soldier slain in battle, and only in manifest zones tied to the plane of Mabar. The most significant such zones in Karrnath exist in the cities of Atur and Odakyr (now called Fort Bones). The number of Karrnathi undead soldiers steadily increased over the course of the war, with the losses of Karrnath's living troops offset by the recovery and raising of their remains.": "奥达克尔仪式只有在对在战斗中被杀的士兵的遗体进行操作时才有效，并且只在与马巴尔平面相连的显灵区进行。在卡尔纳特，最重要的此类区域存在于阿图尔和奥达基尔（现称为骨堡）两座城市。在战争过程中，卡尔纳特的亡灵士兵的数量稳步增长，卡尔纳特的活人部队的损失被他们的遗体的恢复和提高所抵消。",
	"Malevanor claimed that Karrnathi undead are animated and granted intelligence by the patriotic spirit of Karrnath. However, many Karrns fear that the undead are vessels for a darker power—and that Lady Illmarrow or someone else will turn the undead against the living.": "马勒瓦诺声称，卡尔纳特的亡灵是由卡尔纳特的爱国精神赋予其生命力和智慧。然而，许多卡尔恩人担心，亡灵是一种更黑暗的力量的容器--伊尔马罗夫人或其他人会让亡灵反对活人。",
	"Karrnathi undead bear little resemblance to the people they were in life. These undead are content to stand motionless and silent for days. They show no emotion, and certainly no mercy or compassion. Undead soldiers kill any opposing forces—including civilians among those forces—unless given explicit instructions to the contrary.": "卡尔纳提的亡灵与他们生前的人没有什么相似之处。这些亡灵满足于一动不动地站着，沉默数日。他们不表现出任何情感，当然也没有怜悯或同情心。亡灵士兵会杀死任何敌对势力，包括这些势力中的平民，除非得到明确的指示。",
	"A few exceptional Karrnathi undead retain their individuality and the memories of their former lives. Such undead are often found as champions of the Blood of Vol or agents of the Order of the Emerald Claw.": "少数特殊的卡尔纳提亡灵保留了他们的个性和对前世的记忆。这样的亡灵经常被发现是沃尔之血的冠军或翡翠之爪骑士团的代理人。",

	"Lady Illmarrow is a legend—an ancient lich said to dwell in a castle of bone and ice in the coldest regions of the Lhazaar Principalities. Some stories say that she is served by a legion of undead and that she maintains a court of vampires and ghosts in her palace of ice. Other tales claim that when anyone dies in Lhazaar, Illmarrow chooses whether to take their soul before it passes on to the Keeper and Dolurrh.": "伊尔马罗夫人是一个传奇，一个古老的巫师，据说她住在拉扎尔公国最寒冷地区的一座冰骨城堡中。有些故事说，她有一个亡灵军团为她服务，她在她的冰宫里有一个吸血鬼和鬼魂的法庭。其他故事称，当任何人在拉扎尔死亡时，伊尔马罗会选择是否带走他们的灵魂，然后再转交给守护者和多勒尔。",
	"But Lady Illmarrow is no folk tale. She is the greatest necromancer in Eberron, and after centuries of silence, she is setting ancient plots into motion at last. She is the power behind the Order of the Emerald Claw, but her motives for founding the order are buried in her past. Lady Illmarrow has no interest in ruling the living. Rather, she seeks to become Queen of the Dead.": "但伊尔马罗夫人并不是民间传说中的人物。她是Eberron中最伟大的死灵法师，在沉寂了几个世纪之后，她终于将古老的阴谋付诸实施。她是翡翠之爪骑士团背后的力量，但她创立骑士团的动机被埋藏在她的过去。伊尔马罗夫人对统治活人没有兴趣。相反，她试图成为死人的女王。",

	"Long ago, it was revealed that the elven line of Vol—a house that practiced the art of necromancy and bore the Dragonmark of Death—was engaged in secret blood rites with a clan of dragons. The discovery of this pact triggered an unprecedented alliance between the Sibling Kings of Aerenal and the dragons of Argonnessen. The Sibling Kings proclaimed that House Vol would be exterminated to the last member, and the Mark of Death would be eliminated from the world.": "很久以前，人们发现精灵族的沃尔--一个奉行亡灵之术并带有死亡龙纹的家族--与一个龙族进行着秘密的血缘仪式。这一协议的发现引发了艾瑞纳尔的兄弟姐妹国王和阿贡纳森的龙族之间前所未有的联盟。兄弟姐妹国王们宣布，沃尔家族将被消灭到最后一个成员，死亡印记将从世界上消除。",
	"The line of Vol had long been rivals of the Undying Court, and many whisper even today that the attack on House Vol was nothing more than an excuse to eliminate a political rival. But others believe that what the Undying Court truly feared was a path shown in the Draconic Prophecy—that a child born of dragon and elf could become a godlike avatar of death.": "沃尔家族长期以来一直是不死鸟法庭的对手，即使在今天，也有许多人窃窃私语，认为对沃尔家族的攻击不过是为了消灭一个政治对手的借口而已。但也有人认为，不死鸟法庭真正害怕的是龙族预言中的一条道路--龙和精灵所生的孩子可以成为神一样的死亡化身。",
	"Even as dragons and elves fought to destroy the line of Vol, a child was born to the house: Erandis. A scion of elf and dragon, Erandis bore a Mark of Death unlike any other. In time, it might have been her gateway to immortality and unrivaled power, but she was hunted down and killed long before she could master the mark's magic. Her mother, Minara Vol, escaped with her daughter's body to the icy reaches of Farlnen, far from the conflict. There, Minara unleashed all her necromantic power to raise Erandis as a lich.": "即使在龙和精灵为摧毁沃尔家族而战的时候，这个家族也诞生了一个孩子。艾兰狄斯。作为精灵和龙的后代，艾兰迪斯拥有与其他任何人不同的死亡印记。假以时日，这可能是她获得不朽和无与伦比的力量的途径，但她在掌握印记的魔力之前就被追杀了。她的母亲米娜拉-沃尔（Minara Vol）带着女儿的尸体逃到了远离冲突的冰冷的法伦（Farlnen）。在那里，米娜拉释放了她所有的亡灵力量，将艾兰蒂斯培养成了一个巫师。",
	"As an undead being, Erandis lost the use of her dragonmark. Thus, when the diviners of Aerenal asked if the line of Vol had been exterminated and the Mark of Death destroyed, they received a vision affirming that the bloodline of Vol was no more. To the world, the last survivor of that bloodline is known as Lady Illmarrow. But in truth, she is Erandis Vol, heir to the Mark of Death.": "作为一个不死的存在，艾兰迪斯失去了对龙纹的使用。因此，当艾瑞纳的占卜师询问沃尔的血统是否已经被灭绝，死亡印记是否被摧毁时，他们得到了一个异象，确认沃尔的血统已经不复存在。对世界而言，该血统的最后一位幸存者被称为伊尔马罗夫人。但事实上，她是艾兰迪斯-沃尔，死亡印记的继承人。",
	"When Minara restored Erandis as a lich, she hid her daughter's phylactery, weaving enchantments into it that cause Erandis to be reborn in a random safe haven after she is destroyed. Thus, even Erandis herself doesn't know the location or form of her phylactery.": "当米娜拉把艾兰蒂斯恢复成一个巫师时，她把她女儿的法器藏了起来，在里面编织了魔法，使艾兰蒂斯在被摧毁后在一个随机的安全港重生。因此，即使是艾兰迪斯自己也不知道她的法器的位置和形式。",
	"Though she takes great pleasure in fighting the dragons and elves who destroyed her ancestors, Lady Illmarrow has a more important goal: restoring her dragonmark and unlocking godlike powers. The agents of the Emerald Claw who serve her fight either for the good of Karrnath or for personal gain, but Illmarrow cares for nothing except increasing her necromantic knowledge and finding a way to restore her lost mark.": "虽然伊尔马罗女士以与毁灭她祖先的龙和精灵战斗为乐，但她有一个更重要的目标：恢复她的龙印和释放神一样的力量。为她服务的翡翠之爪的特工要么是为了卡尔纳特的利益，要么是为了个人利益而战斗，但伊尔马罗除了增加她的死灵知识和找到恢复她失去的印记的方法外，什么也不在乎。",
	"The Blood of Vol and Lady Illmarrow are both legacies of the line of Vol, but they aren't one and the same. As far as the world knows, the line of Vol was exterminated. Followers of the Blood of Vol who have heard of Lady Illmarrow believe that she's a champion of their faith, but they don't worship or serve her. And the powers of priests of the Blood of Vol don't come from Lady Illmarrow.": "沃尔之血和伊尔马罗夫人都是沃尔家族的遗产，但他们并不是同一个人。据世人所知，沃尔一族已经被灭绝了。听说过伊尔马罗夫人的沃尔之血的追随者认为她是他们信仰的捍卫者，但他们并不崇拜或侍奉她。而沃尔之血的祭司们的力量并不来自伊尔马罗夫人。",

	"The power granted by an aberrant dragonmark is unpredictable. When running a Tarkanan assassin, you can roll on the Aberrant Dragonmark Innate Spells table to determine the spells gained from that NPC's aberrant mark, replacing the spells in the stat block's Innate Spellcasting trait.": "反常龙印所赋予的力量是不可预测的。当运行一个Tarkanan刺客时，你可以在反常龙印的先天法术表上滚动，以确定从该NPC的反常印记中获得的法术，取代状态块的先天法术特性中的法术。",

	"The Lord of Blades is a warforged warlord who has broken all ties with his former masters. He has established a nation for his people deep in the Mournland, centered in a great fortress where warforged from all over Khorvaire can come and feel a sense of belonging.

	"Some tales assert that the Lord of Blades led the warforged armies of Cyre in the Last War. Others cast him as a newer warforged, perhaps the last to come out of the Cannith creation forges before the Thronehold Accords led to their dismantling. One story claims the Lord of Blades caused the destruction of Cyre and warns that he plans to repeat the Day of Mourning in each of the remaining Five Nations. Whatever the truth, he has become a beacon for warforged everywhere.": "有些故事断言，刀锋之王在最后的战争中领导了赛尔的战争锻造军队。其他人则认为他是一个较新的战争锻造者，也许是在《王座协议》导致其被拆除之前，最后一个从坎尼斯创造的锻造者出来的。有一种说法是，刀锋之王造成了赛尔的毁灭，并警告说他计划在剩下的五个国家中重复哀悼日。无论真相如何，他已经成为各地战神的灯塔。",

	"Constantly jockeying for position, each tsucora hopes to be reincarnated as a more powerful servant of the Dreaming Dark.

	"Though it's possible for undying to appear anywhere, it is rare for them to manifest naturally. The only place where they are found in significant numbers is the island of Aerenal, a land whose close ties to the plane of Irian suffuse it with positive energy.

	"The light of Irian sustains the spirit, but it doesn't preserve the physical body. The undying appear as desiccated corpses, their flesh withering away over centuries.

The light shed by an undying doesn't generate heat, but it provides a sense of warmth and comfort.": "伊里安之光支撑着精神，但它并不能保护肉体。不死人看起来就像干枯的尸体，他们的肉体在几个世纪里逐渐枯萎。同时，不死人的精神围绕着身体--一个光环，形成灵魂的阴影。不死鸟散发出的光并不产生热量，但它提供了一种温暖和舒适的感觉。",

	"Undying are sustained by positive energy, whether found in manifest zones tied to Irian—such as in Shae Mordai, the Aereni City of the Dead—or freely given by the devotion of mortal beings. The worship of the Undying Court is what sustains the undying of Aerenal, but devotion is a finite resource. As such, each elf that becomes an undying must earn their afterlife. If an undying elf leaves Aerenal, they require a community of elves or another source of positive energy to sustain them. Failing this, their light fades and they eventually die.": "不死之身靠正能量维持，无论是在与伊里安相关的显化区--如艾瑞尼的死亡之城Shae Mordai，还是由凡人的奉献自由给予。对不死阁的崇拜是维持艾瑞尼不死的原因，但奉献是一种有限的资源。因此，每个成为不死族的精灵都必须赢得他们的来世。如果一个不死的精灵离开了Aerenal，他们需要一个精灵社区或另一个正能量的来源来维持他们。如果做不到这一点，他们的光芒就会消退，最终死亡。",
	"The honored undead of Aerenal are united in the Undying Court. Based in the city of Shae Mordai, the members of the Undying Court spend their time meditating, engaging in research, or continuing to perfect the arts they practiced in life.

	"The greatest members of the Undying Court are the ascendant councilors. These beings of pure light are focused on contemplating the mysteries of life and the planes, and can work together to wield godlike power that allows them to shield Aerenal from almost any threat. However, the ascendant councilors can exercise power beyond Aerenal only by acting through devoted mortals—paladins and clerics of the Undying Court.": "不死阁最伟大的成员是长老会成员。这些纯洁的生命专注于思考生命和星球的奥秘，并能共同发挥神一样的力量，使他们能够保护阿伦纳免受几乎任何威胁。然而，长老会成员只有通过忠实的凡人--不死阁的牧师和神职人员，才能行使超越阿伦纳的权力。",

	"Undying councilors guide and protect the people of Aerenal. They are the most powerful members of the Undying Court who still maintain their physical forms. While many undying councilors spend their days advising the living, some devote years projecting their consciousness into the Astral Plane, seeking new knowledge to share with their people. Still, not all minds are capable of assimilating immortality, and undying councilors sometimes buckle under the strain and go mad.": "不死鸟议员指导和保护Aerenal的人民。他们是不死族法庭中最强大的成员，仍然保持着他们的身体形态。许多不死鸟议员每天都在为活人提供建议，有些人则长年累月地将自己的意识投射到星界，寻求新的知识与他们的人民分享。尽管如此，并不是所有的人都有能力吸收不朽的力量，不朽的议员们有时会在压力下屈服，变得疯狂。",
