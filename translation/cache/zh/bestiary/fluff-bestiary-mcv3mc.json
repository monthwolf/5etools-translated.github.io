	"Blazes are elemental beings that congregate at Nether fortresses. They float a short distance above the ground, and each one is orbited by three sets of glowing rods. When a blaze is destroyed, it sometimes leaves one of these rods behind. Blaze rods are a source of great energy that, when carefully crushed into powder, can be used to brew potions and craft other magic items.": "烈焰是聚集在尼瑟堡垒的元素生物。他们漂浮在离地面不远的地方，每个人都被三组发光的棒子围绕着。当一个火焰被摧毁时，它有时会留下其中的一根棒子。火焰棒是一种巨大能量的来源，当它被小心翼翼地碾成粉末时，可以用来酿造药水和制作其他魔法物品。",
	"A blaze attacks by launching three fireballs from its fiery core. This fire ignites creatures and flammable objects. If necessary, a blaze levitates into the air to better see and more easily target its enemies.": "炽热的火焰通过从其火热的核心发射三个火球进行攻击。这种火会点燃生物和易燃物。如果有必要，烈焰会悬浮在空中，以便更好地观察和更容易地瞄准它的敌人。",
	"A creeper is a green, armless creature that emerges in darkness and silently prowls the Overworld on its four short legs. Its peculiar face bears no clue of its motives, but its destructiveness makes it one of the greatest threats to both life and property in the Overworld.": "爬行者是一种绿色的、无臂的生物，它在黑暗中出现，用四条短腿静静地在世界范围内游走。它奇特的面孔上没有任何关于其动机的线索，但它的破坏力使它成为世界上对生命和财产的最大威胁之一。",
	"A creeper quietly shuffles toward Humanoid prey. When it gets close enough, it halts and begins to hiss like a burning fuse. Unless the creeper is defeated or its target gets far enough away that the creeper defuses itself, the creeper explodes a few short moments later, leaving a crater where it once stood.": "一只爬山虎悄悄地走向人形猎物。当它足够接近时，它会停下来，并开始像燃烧的导火线一样发出嘶嘶声。除非爬山虎被打败，或者它的目标走得足够远，使爬山虎自我拆除，否则爬山虎会在很短的时间内爆炸，在它曾经站立的地方留下一个弹坑。",
	"Creepers have an uncanny ability to appear when least expected, and few places are safe from their explosive nature. Yet creepers have one strange weakness: they fear cats and do all they can to avoid them.": "爬行者有一种不可思议的能力，能在最不经意的时候出现，很少有地方能避免它们的爆炸性。然而，爬行者有一个奇怪的弱点：他们害怕猫，并尽其所能避免它们。",
	"If a creeper is struck by lightning, rather than being harmed, it becomes charged with electrical power. In this charged state, the creeper gains a bluish aura and can explode with even greater power.": "如果爬山虎被雷电击中，而不是受到伤害，它就会被注入电能。在这种带电状态下，爬山虎会获得一种蓝色的光环，并能爆发出更大的力量。",
	"The mighty Ender Dragon is one of a kind—a vast, flying creature with void-black scales and purple eyes. It soars above the central island of the End. No one can say whether it is a guardian or a prisoner of the End, but either way, the Ender Dragon challenges anyone who enters its domain.": "强大的埃德龙是一种--巨大的飞行生物，拥有虚无的黑色鳞片和紫色眼睛。它翱翔在末日的中央岛屿之上。没有人能说清它是末日的守护者还是囚徒，但无论如何，安德龙都在挑战任何进入其领域的人。",
	"The Ender Dragon buffets enemies with great wings, engulfs foes with its gaseous breath weapon, and delivers crushing bites with its powerful jaws. Its hide is strong enough to deflect all but the deadliest weapons.": "埃德龙用巨大的翅膀缓冲敌人，用它的气态呼吸武器吞噬敌人，用它强大的下颚发出粉碎性的咬击。它的皮毛足够强大，除了最致命的武器外，还能抵挡所有的武器。",
	"The Ender Dragon has a special relationship with the ten 40-foot-tall obsidian towers scattered around the central island of the End. At the top of each tower is an End crystal that sends a beam of healing energy to the Ender Dragon when it flies nearby. If slain, the Ender Dragon can be brought back to life by placing four End crystals on the portal that leads back to the Overworld.": "埃德龙与散布在末日中心岛周围的十座40英尺高的黑曜石塔有着特殊的关系。在每座塔的顶端都有一个End水晶，当埃德龙飞到附近时，它会向它发送一束治疗能量。如果被杀，埃德龙可以通过将四颗末世水晶放在通往超凡世界的传送门上，使其重获新生。",
	"When the Ender Dragon ends its turn within 60 feet of an End crystal, the crystal emits a healing beam that causes the dragon to regain 20 hit points. The dragon can benefit from such healing only once per turn.": "当艾德龙在终结水晶的60英尺范围内结束其回合时，水晶会发出一道治疗光束，使艾德龙恢复20点生命值。龙每回合只能从这种治疗中获益一次。",
	"An End crystal is a Large object that has Armor Class 11; 30 hit points; vulnerability to bludgeoning and thunder damage; resistance to piercing and slashing damage; and immunity to poison and psychic damage. When a crystal is destroyed, it explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere of destructive energy. Any creature in that area must make a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 ({@damage 6d6}) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "末日水晶是一个大型物体，它的护甲等级为11级；命中率为30；易受重击和雷击伤害；对穿刺和切割伤害有抵抗力；对中毒和精神伤害有免疫力。当一个水晶被摧毁时，它会在一个半径为20英尺的破坏性能量球中爆炸。该区域内的任何生物必须做一个{@dc 15}灵巧的蓄力动作，蓄力失败会受到21({@damage 6d6})的力量伤害，蓄力成功会受到一半的伤害。",
	"Endermen are tall, black, bipedal creatures with long, thin limbs and piercing, purple eyes. Violet particles flicker in and out of existence around them. Endermen are unnerving and enigmatic, acting in a manner that is all but impossible to interpret.": "Endermen是高大、黑色、双足的生物，有着细长的四肢和刺眼的紫色眼睛。紫色的颗粒在他们周围忽隐忽现。Endermen是令人不安和神秘的，其行为方式几乎无法解释。",
	"Endermen seem particularly drawn to the End, where they gather in large groups. They are uncommon visitors to other dimensions, although they appear more often in pairs in such peculiar places as the warped forests of the Nether. They shun sunlight and are hurt by water, including rain. When an Enderman becomes the target of a ranged weapon or takes damage, it teleports to a safer location nearby and makes a distinctive \"voop\" sound at its destination.": "埃德曼人似乎特别被吸引到尽头，他们在那里聚集成大群。他们是其他维度不常见的访客，尽管他们更经常成对出现在尼瑟斯的扭曲森林等奇特的地方。他们回避阳光，并受到水的伤害，包括雨水。当埃德曼成为远程武器的目标或受到伤害时，它会传送到附近一个更安全的地方，并在目的地发出独特的 \"voop \"声。",
	"Endermen have no known predators. When a Humanoid looks directly at an Enderman, the Enderman becomes enraged, opens its mouth horrifyingly wide, and rushes to attack with its long arms. A defeated Enderman implodes and sometimes leaves behind an Ender pearl, which, when thrown, teleports the thrower to the place it lands.": "Endermen没有已知的掠食者。当一个人形生物直视Enderman时，Enderman就会被激怒，张开可怕的大嘴，用它的长臂冲上去攻击。被打败的埃德曼会内爆，有时会留下一颗埃德珍珠，当它被扔出去时，会把扔出去的人传送到它的位置上。",
	"Running through the forests of the Overworld on four legs, this gray-furred hunter is at home in the cold of the taiga.": "这名灰毛猎人用四条腿在世界的森林中奔跑，在寒冷的泰加林中也很自在。",
	"Wolves hunt in packs, roaming their territories and chasing sheep, rabbits, and foxes. Wild wolves are typically indifferent to Humanoids, neither running from nor attacking them, but a pack of wolves becomes hostile toward any creature that hurts one of the pack's members. Wolves can be tamed by adventurers who feed and look after them. Tamed wolves follow their masters everywhere they go.": "狼成群结队地捕猎，在它们的领地上漫游，追赶羊、兔子和狐狸。野生狼通常对人形生物漠不关心，既不逃避也不攻击它们，但一群狼会对任何伤害狼群成员的生物产生敌意。狼可以被喂养和照顾它们的冒险家所驯服。被驯服的狼走到哪里都会跟着主人。",
	"Wolves instinctively regard animated skeletons as enemies and attack them without hesitation. Even tamed wolves, which obediently hold themselves back from attacking their natural prey, freely charge at skeletons unless they are commanded to sit.": "狼会本能地把有生命的骷髅视为敌人，并毫不犹豫地攻击它们。即使是被驯服的狼，也会顺从地克制自己不攻击自然界的猎物，自由地冲向骷髅，除非它们被命令坐下。"
