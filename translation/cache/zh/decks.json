Its garrison is commanded by an evil knight with a wyvern mount.": "骷髅港俯瞰着萨加斯河，这是一条穿过地下山的第三层的水道。海盗曾经将这个地下定居点用作贸易港口，但现在它是一个充斥着怪物的巢穴，间谍和刺客在这里磨练他们的手艺。小心那座俯瞰河流的堡垒！它的守备军由一名骑着一只飞龙的邪恶骑士指挥。",

Anyone who can terrify the drow should be avoided at all costs.": "Undermountain的一部分是由黑暗精灵雕刻而成的。Muiral，据说是Halaster的前保镖和学徒，宣称拥有这个领地，并以猎杀闯入者为乐。这些大厅里散布着被屠杀者的骨骼。即使是黑暗精灵也会小声地谈论Muiral。任何能吓倒黑暗精灵的人都应该尽量避免。",
