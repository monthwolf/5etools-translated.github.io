								"大自然，或者森林，可能离我们的家、Twitch直播、或我们玩像{@i 5th Edition}（因为奇怪的是，这是我们现在生活的魔法世界）的舞台相当遥远。我们将骰子投在由我们对其历史一无所知的树木表面上。这棵树是否有故事，或者有一家猫头鹰居住在其中，或者有一只狐狸幼崽在它的树枝下躲过暴风雨？我们不知道这些故事，因为我们编织自己的故事，但连接仍然存在。即使只是在我们的想象中，我们仍然在荒野中跋涉，嗅着新鲜空气，害怕它的危险。",
								"讲故事本身一直与自然联系在一起。动物作为神灵或类人主角的传说贯穿所有文化。美洲土著关于恶作剧精灵乌鸦的传说，中世纪寓言中的{@i Owl and the Nightingale}，或者像{@i Grimm's Fairy Tales}这样明显简单的事物，都是自然世界如何塑造故事叙述的例子。动物的神奇及其通常看不见的生活引起我们的好奇，激发我们的想象力，当我们最终放慢脚步去观察时，我们会在它们身上看到很多自己的影子。动物将我们与自然联系在一起，是强大故事叙述的媒介。",
								"这就是为什么我相信角色扮演游戏在过去几年里如此复兴，因为我们正在寻找与我们周围世界的联系。我们想要摆脱屏幕，忘记我们复杂的生活，像英雄一样生活，解决我们可以解决的问题，而不仅仅是听新闻并担心。我们可以帮助人们，我们可以成为英雄，我们拥有魔法。即使在想象中，这些事情也是非常强大的。",
								"在谦卑林，我们正在回归作为讲故事者的本质，利用大自然和周围的动物在一个幻想世界中冒险。我们每天被如此多的科技包围着，走进大自然对许多人来说根本不是一个选择。我们的工作耗时，我们的生活艰难复杂，我们的食物在我们永远看不到的地方生长，包装在塑料中放在货架上等待我们消费。这些事物使我们与大自然的故事、生命的故事、季节的更迭以及我们与周围世界的联系脱节。实际上，即使是那只不起眼的鸽子也有着有趣的生活，只是当我们在城市街道上路过它们时，并没有给予它们第二眼。",
								"我自小就喜欢鸟类，它们一直是我与大自然联系的方式。我从10岁起就开始救助鸟类，曾经与最小的蜂鸟一起工作，也曾与一只名叫伊万的脾气暴躁的红尾鹰合作，它是我在大学时期照顾的。当我住在洛杉矶时，我开始救助鸽子，因为它们无处不在，是殖民者遗忘的宠物，也是侵入性物种，破坏了它们所生活的栖息地。这些鸟类聪明幽默，几乎被每个动物收容所所忽视。它们是动物世界中的迷失与被遗忘者，这就是我爱上它们的原因。它们有故事要讲，每一只都有自己的个性和怪癖。",
								"人类并没有那么不同于动物。如果我们留心观察它们，我们就能理解它们，拯救它们，与它们共存，并尊重它们。我们对动物越有同情心，我们的世界就会变得更美好。讲述它们的故事和讲述我们自己的故事一样重要，这有助于我们与地球上其他生物建立联系并怀有同情心。因此，我鼓励你在谦卑森林中创造自己的传奇故事，然后去森林亲自见证。也许它们也有自己的故事要告诉你。",

								"在制定《谦木》的艺术指导时，我希望表达这是一个充满生机和多样性角色的世界，他们生活在一个历史悠久且复杂的广阔森林中。《谦木》背后的概念驱动力是希望创造一个视觉上引人入胜的世界，让人感觉它是活生生的，这意味着一个既美好又充满欢迎之感、又神奇又神秘的世界。这也意味着一个充满秘密、隐藏危险和障碍的世界，需要一队冒险者来克服。",
								"当我年轻的时候，我最热衷的电影和书籍是那些吸引了年轻和老年观众的作品，其中的角色可能是可爱的森林动物，但依然勇敢地探索了一系列复杂而具有挑战性的主题，这些主题我们在成年后依然在思考。这些故事给我留下了深刻的印象，我至今仍然会回顾这些作品。",

								"作为艺术家，我们必须认真考虑世界的每一个方面，当然包括我们的主要角色和各种怪物的设计，还有一个角色的家可能是什么样子，他们可能穿什么样的衣服，以及我们应该如何设计这瓶古老的狐灵酿造的接骨草莓酒？我们描绘了被光束淹没的森林，你必须充满决心地穿越纠缠而危险的沼泽，以及舒适的室内，你几乎能闻到烤炉里烤着的杰宾大小的面包的味道。爱常常隐藏在细节中，就像一场冒险中一些最重要的时刻可能是安静的时刻，篝火旁交换的小词语，或者暗示着更大谜团的微小线索。",
								"创建这个项目是一段难忘的旅程，就像Humblewood本身那些长满杂草的小径一样，充满了许多惊喜、曲折和转折。我一直对大自然和动物有着亲近感，这一直是我个人作品的主要灵感来源。我还记得当我第一次坐下来草拟了一只勇敢的小骑士猫头鹰的初始版本，我们现在称之为Riffin，那时我无法想象这只小猫头鹰背后的想法会如何演变成一个由我们设计师、作家和艺术家团队精心打造、供玩家探索的完整世界。",

						"在遥远的埃弗登（Everden）世界上，位于一个伟大大陆的东海岸，有一片广袤的森林坐落在群山和大海之间。这就是谦卑森林（Humblewood），一个古老而神奇的地方，它吟唱着无尽的歌谣，奏响着生与死的伟大节奏。这片森林，被当地居民称为“Wood”，与其他森林不同。这里的树木古老而强大，稀有的树木甚至高达小山般高度。这里熟悉的野兽长得异常巨大，身上带有谦卑森林独有的纹饰和图案。这个地区还是两个动物般的类人种族的家园，分别是鸟人（birdfolk）和谦卑族（humblefolk）。它们共同分享着森林及其丰富的资源。",
						"在早期，鸟人族和谦卑族居住在森林周围的小村庄里，彼此之间距离很近。这些与世隔绝的社区容易受到一个自称为“强盗联盟”的匪徒和掠夺者组织的威胁。为了保护自己免受联盟的侵害，鸟人族在森林的树冠中建造了设防城市。鸟人族军队与谦卑族联合起来，被称为“栖卫军”的鸟人族军队击退了强盗，为该地区带来了和平与安全。随着时间的推移，鸟人族文化传播开来，首都奥尔德哈特（Alderheart）成为了伍德地区最具政治影响力的地方。",
						"但是这片森林也经历过悲伤。就在奥尔德哈特(Alderheart)建立不久之后，一场被称为“大灾难”的森林大火烧毁了一部分木头。火灾的起因不明，但它让这片地区永久受损。直到今天，它被称为“烧焦林地”，一片灰烬的干旱土地，后来成为许多奇怪的火焰生物的家园。",
						"《招标者》(The Tenders)，一个由德鲁伊和秘术师组成的组织，致力于用自然魔法治愈被烧焦的林地。他们在整个森林周围建立了聚会点，每当森林发生火灾时，他们就会提供援助。然而，自从林地被烧毁以来，这片森林很少发生火灾。然而，大自然的平衡却可能被一根火花打破。",
						"最近，自古以来罕见的烈焰席卷了（Wood）。森林居民再次被迫离开家园，寻求庇护在（Alderheart）之中，而栖息在树冠圣所的鸟类居民则竭尽所能保护自己的安全。谦卑族和鸟族之间的关系变得紧张。此外，一个新生的强盗联盟人数激增。他们的目标是（Alderheart），那里被火焰驱逐的人们正在寻求生存的途径。",
						"你是木之国的一名公民，卷入了这场动荡。或许你是来自另一个世界的故事讲述者。无论如何，木之国的未来由你来书写。在这本书中，你会找到所有需要的工具，来塑造你的角色，游历这片土地，并创作属于你自己的《谦木之国》故事。",
						"是否谦卑森林能够幸存下来取决于你。前往冒险吧！只有你能够恢复森林的平衡。"

								"《Humblewood(谦木)》中的鸟人种族与森林本身一样多样且独特。只有熟练的人才能在森林中生存，而鸟人已经成为了森林地面和树冠之上的大师，他们在整个谦木中建立了几个定居点（俗称“栖所”）。尽管在谦木中不同种类的鸟人之间存在地区差异和文化特点，但鸟人种族仍然分享着许多文化、语言、历史和起源神话。这种团结使他们能够共同努力，繁荣发展，创造了谦木中持续了一个时代的和谐。",
								"虽然是一个多样化的群体，适应了木林中各种环境的鸟人也分享了几个身体特征，这些特征使他们在搭建栖息地时能够找到共同点。除了明显的身体相似之外，所有的鸟人都有长满羽毛的手臂，延伸成翼状附肢。虽然不能进行真正的动力飞行，但鸟人强壮的空心骨骼和轻盈的身体使他们能够轻松地利用羽毛覆盖的手臂滑翔，除非受到严重阻碍，所有的鸟人都能从本应是致命的坠落中优雅地恢复。在一些鸟人种族中，这些翅膀已经变得足够强壮，可以让它们的主人在一次强有力的拍打中上升，而其他一些种族则发展出了爪子，既是致命的防御武器，也是攀爬高大树木的有用工具。",
								"鸟人已经在（Humblewood）中确立了自己作为一个不可忽视的政治力量。他们将自己强大的首都塑造成了伟大的树木（Alderheart），而从这个安全的堡垒中，他们的统治机构，即鸟人议会，制定了影响整个（Humblewood）的决策。鸟人得到了充分的防御，多亏了（Perch Guard），这是一支受过空中和地面战斗训练的士兵力量，他们保护着城市和其中的居民。",
								"尽管多年来奥尔德哈特一直是和平与和谐的象征，但火灾的到来使该地区陷入混乱。栖木卫队的力量在天篷城市间分散，勉强能够保护主要道路供商人通行，同时又要确保他们的家园免受火灾的侵袭。如今，伟大的鸟人城市面临比以往更多的来自强盗和森林火灾的威胁。然而，在这一切之中，鸟人们仍然信任团结，他们之间以及与各种居民群体之间的团结，就像他们以前那样度过即将到来的风暴。",

								"在谦卑森林（Humblewood）并非所有居民都是鸟类。术语“谦卑民（humblefolk）”在整个森林中用来指代那些生活在离森林地面更近的非鸟类族群。与鸟类不同，鸟类共同的语言、历史、神话和文化使他们在谦卑森林的大部分历史中能够和谐共存。而谦卑民代表了一个不同的族群、文化和世界观，许多人并不总是能够达成一致。",
								"很久以前，森林地面的居民之间达成了一项协议，团结起来对抗流窜的强盗，平息横行的内讧，这些内讧给整个木林带来了灾难。这个协议被称为“谦卑族条约”，并由鸟人见证，当时他们正开始塑造奥德哈特的树干。鸟人向谦卑族提供了在他们伟大城市内的安全，许多人接受了他们的提议。随着时间的推移，越来越多的谦卑族移居到新建立的鸟人栖息地，尽管许多人发现鸟人的建筑对于没有翅膀的生物来说有所限制。同样，一些鸟人群体在繁荣的栖息地内感到过于拥挤，开始散居并寻求庇护在小型林地村庄内。即使在今天，选择生活在森林地面上的鸟人发现自己受到污名化，因为在鸟人社会中，生活在树冠中被认为是合适的。",
								"在条约签订后，(`Humblefolk`) 谦逊族群开始重新居住在树下的小木村庄中，尽管现在他们与一些地面鸟族一起生活在更多样化的社区中。随着(`Humblefolk Treaty`) 谦逊族条约的扩展，使谦逊族在危机时可以请求(`Perch Guard`) 栖木卫队的驻守，以及鸟族民兵保护商队安全通行，(`the Wood`) 木之地真正进入了黄金时代。许多谦逊族的生活是和平繁荣的...直到大火的到来。",
								"随着烈焰蔓延，普通村民向过度延伸的栖巢卫士请求援助，却往往见到援助来得太迟，甚至根本没有。更糟糕的是，多年来，普通人社区之间的分歧加剧：那些在鸟人城市中找到繁荣的人采纳了栖巢居民的观点，而那些生活在林地中的人则面临着强盗和森林火灾的持续威胁。还有一些人甚至离开加入了新近改组的强盗联盟，他们不仅看到了生存的途径，还看到了与栖巢鸟人为破坏誓言和不公平对待报复的机会。然而，在条约有效的地方，依然可以找到充满活力的普通人社区。普通人是坚韧的，每个种族都会想出一种在这片危险的森林中生存的方法。",

				"In the beginning, there was only the sound of wings. Faint at first, the distant beats were easy to miss, but as time passed they grew stronger, faster, until they could be heard across the great unending dark. Then, with a single flap, creation burst forth: fire, ice, air, water, soil and sky, all came from the sound of feathers that resonated throughout the cosmos. This is the Great Rhythm, and by the Great Rhythm are all things moved. The Rhythm tells the sun when to set, and the moon when to rise. The Rhythm tells the seeds when to flower, the trees when to shed their leaves, and the snows when to fall. The essence of everything there is comes from the Great Rhythm. One day, the Rhythm may cue the end of creation—but there will be no end to the Rhythm itself. As every downbeat has an upbeat to follow it, so too will the cycles of nature eventually start again—for even though the Rhythm can be faint at times, it is everlasting and eternal.",
				"Every denizen of the forest, from the large to the small, from predator to prey, knows of The Great Rhythm: the beating force that is the pulse of life itself. To the birdfolk, the Rhythm began with the sound of beating wings, but other folk of the Wood tell that it began with the thundering of hooves, the padding of paws, or with a tiny heartbeat. Birdfolk believe that two great spirits emerged from the Rhythm. They were the first Amaranthine: Ardea, whose wings usher in the dawn, and Tyton, whose wings are the shadow of night. They are the avatars of life and death, and keepers of the Rhythm.",

								"With the birth of Ardea and Tyton, the world was set into motion. Where once there was nothing but barrens, the land came alive with the coming of the Amaranthine, and the world began its endless cycle of life and death. Their arrival split the formless sky into day and night. They created the sun and the moon, and the succession of light and dark which emerged from their movement across the heavens told all life when to act and when to rest. Ardea and Tyton were born from opposite parts of the Great Rhythm. Each knows of the other's existence, but they keep to their separate spheres, meeting only in the early hours of dawn and the late hours of dusk to exchange dominion over the sky. In seasons of warmth, Ardea has a greater reign over the sky, while in seasons of bitter cold, Tyton's power increases.",
								"The two Amaranthine created much of the life in Humblewood. Ardea suffused the days with sun-loving flowers, plants, and animals, while Tyton baptized the night with insects and animals that embrace the dark. They birthed sentient races, and from them originate all birdfolk, the first of their children, followed shortly after by the humblefolk.",
								"Originally, all birdfolk were the same. It was difficult to distinguish them from the birds of the forest, as they even possessed the ability to fly. One day, the entire flock of birdfolk decided on a grand contest of gift-giving, to prove which of them was the most worthy to lead. Ardea agreed to act as judge; whoever could present her with the greatest gift would become leaders among her children. For an entire season, birdfolk searched and scrounged, gathered and hunted, returning with trinkets, baubles, gifts great and small. Though Ardea commended all her children for their gifts, only five were truly deserving of her boon.",
								"Gesme, Reya, Hanera, Altus, and Clhuran: these five became leaders of the birdfolk. They inspired tales, devotion, and gave the birdfolk races their distinct forms and skills. These great ones went on to become part of the Great Rhythm as keepers of nature's balance and protectors of birdfolk across Everden, eventually ascending and joining the Amaranthine. The followers of each of the five were granted new forms and great gifts, to match their leader's exploits. Yet, to accept these gifts, something needed to be lost. This is why the birdfolk of today can only glide: their gift of flight was taken as the price for becoming something new."

								"The first to present Ardea with a worthy gift was Gesme, a clever birdfolk who saw potential in the world that her kin could scarcely imagine. She had observed the great orb of fire that Ardea had placed high in the sky, and how Ardea had positioned it a great distance from the land and its creatures, so it would warm them gently without burning them. But Gesme also saw that the sun vanished with the coming of night, when the creatures of the dark began to prowl, and thought: \"How remarkable would it be to have some of that fire in the world?\"",
								"Other birdfolk laughed at Gesme as she spent days plotting, and reading the sky. She examined every tree, from the great ash to the supple willow. Each day she carried a new branch in her beak, dropping many in frustration. The birdfolk were puzzled, but dismissed her actions. Then, one day at dawn, when the sun was at its lowest point in the sky, Gesme appeared with an oak branch in her beak. Without a word, she took off straight into the horizon. She flew for what seemed like ages, but the oak branch was light and did not trouble her. As she neared the sun her feathers, talons, and beak began to blacken in the heat. Still, she persisted. The oak was hardy and spry, and did not wither. Finally, she stuck the tip of the branch into the sun, igniting it. Hastily she flew back toward the ground, with the branch burning bright in her talons. The oak was patient, and did not burn up, keeping the flame steady as Gesme returned from the sky.",
								"\"See what I have brought here!\" she bragged, as the astounded birdfolk looked upon her scorched feathers. \"This will keep us warm on the cold days of winter, and safe through the long nights!\"",
								"Ardea was at first concerned at the presence of fire in the world, for she knew the forests could burn, and that misuse of the fire would bring harm to Everden. But, when she saw the birdfolk gather around the fires, and felt the gentle warmth a small flame could provide to her children, she was overcome with happiness.",
								"\"This,\" she declared, \"is worthy of a boon.\"",
								"And thus was Gesme changed. Set ablaze with the flames of knowledge and creativity, she became an Amaranthine. The forms of her followers changed too, and they became the first corvums. They were gifted with a bit of her cleverness and foresight, but Ardea gave them all black talons, feathers, and beaks as a reminder of the price Gesme paid to bring fire into the world."

								"The second to present a worthy gift was Reya, whose hunting skills were second to none. Though she was small, she was nimble, swift, and wise in the ways of the forest. Reya was capable and reliable, but birdfolk deemed her too independent to be a leader. She would travel the length and breadth of the land on her hunts, sometimes not returning for weeks at a time.",
								"During one of her journeys Reya encountered a stranger. The traveler's true form was hidden under a cloak, but they could fly and clearly felt as comfortable in the trees as any birdfolk. They had heard of Reya's skill in racing, hunting, and navigating the forest, and proposed three challenges, to which Reya agreed.",
								"For the first event, the pair moved to a patch of open sky overlooking rugged plains. There was a rocky outcropping in the distance; whoever flew there first would be the winner. The race began, and Reya immediately fell behind, the cloaked figure moving faster than Reya had ever seen.",
								"Reya summoned all her strength to keep up, beating her wings like never before. Yet the traveler kept inching forward, and she was unable to close the gap in time.",
								"Reya steeled herself for the next challenge. They flew to the meadows, where small creatures grazed, and it was decided that the first to catch five hares would be the winner. Reya moved with purpose, confident no one could best her skills with a bow, a tool of her own creation. Each of her shots found its mark, until she had but a single hare left to catch. But when Reya looked over at the traveler, she was shocked to see them waiting impatiently with a full complement.",
								"For the third and final event, the pair flew to the center of the forest. The first to emerge into the open fields beyond would be the victor. These were forests Reya knew well, and she was certain she would win. As soon as they had started though, Reya saw the traveler alight, darting through the trees as if weightless. Reya kept pace, using every trick she could to give herself an advantage. Still the traveler pulled ahead, if only by inches, and emerged victorious.",
								"Reya landed on a nearby branch and cursed her lack of skill. After a moment of pause however, she regained her composure, and thanked her competitor. Yet the traveler laughed, a sound so familiar, Reya wondered why she hadn't noticed before.",
								"\"You have nothing to be ashamed of, birdfolk. I see your skills are real. You are the first to so nearly best me in every event, and this is no easy feat.\" The traveler removed their cloak, and Reya could not believe her eyes. She had been challenged by the wind itself.",
								"It swirled, spinning a cloak out of the very clouds, which it placed around Reya. \"Consider this a gift, for providing me with such sport.\" Reya thanked the wind, and with that, it departed, caressing Reya's feathers in a familiar breeze.",
								"When the time came to present a gift, Reya offered Ardea her cloak of clouds, along with the story of her adventure. As Reya told her tale, Ardea could see the eyes of the other birdfolk light up with excitement. When Reya had finished, Ardea returned Reya's cloak to her, saying the story of her adventure was the rarer gift. Reya was changed, and became the Amaranthine of wind, archery, and exploration. Those she inspired became the first raptors. They began to take on a nomadic lifestyle, finding their fortune day by day as Reya once did and told tales of their own adventures by the light of the campfire."

From the earth, Hanera learned to speak with plants—knowledge she used to better care for them. She soon earned fame among the birdfolk, as one who grew the largest and best-tasting crops.",

								"Hanera knew that she couldn't feed herself and this family while storing crops for Ardea. Even still, she could not turn them away in their desperate state. She offered to share her home and her food for as long as the travelers needed, making sure their needs were met before saving any food for Ardea.",
								"The travelers stayed with Hanera for many nights while the mother healed. Each day, Hanera would prepare the family meals, telling the plants of their plight. The plants understood, and were honored to nourish the weary and wounded birdfolk. In return, Hanera ensured their seeds were saved and planted again, so their lives would continue indefinitely.",
								"At night, Hanera applied medicine to the mother's wound made from the leaves of kindly herbs. By the end of the season the mother had healed, the family was in good health, and they gratefully flew away.",
								"When the day finally came for birdfolk to present their gifts, all Hanera could offer Ardea was a few fruits and vegetables. She wove them together along with flowers she had grown, attempting to make her offering look more cheerful.",
								"\"I'm sorry, Mother Stork,\" Hanera said. \"I had meant to present you with a great harvest, but this is all I could provide.\"",
								"Ardea took the wreath, and spoke gladly: \"You have given me more than enough, for you see my child, I received your compassion for an entire season.\" As Ardea spoke, celestial messengers appeared by her side, and together they transformed into the birdfolk family Hanera had so tenderly cared for.",
								"For her charity, Hanera received the Amaranthine's boon: her feathers turned green and grew into vines and shoots, adorned with the most beautiful flowers. Other birdfolk stared in awe, and those who followed Hanera became the first gallus, blessed with her inspiring kindness, as well as her closeness with the earth and all growing things."

								"The fourth to present a commendable gift was Altus, whose hunting skills were second only to Reya's, though Altus journeyed the Wood to test his limits rather than explore as Reya did. Altus felt pure joy when overcoming obstacles. He loved the cold seasons and challenged himself by hunting at night. His nocturnal existence granted Altus a perspective other birdfolk lacked.",
								"\"What if I gifted Ardea something she has never seen before?\" he thought. \"Yes! I shall hunt the moon, and present it to her, so that she may see its lovely glow.\" This would be unthinkable to any other birdfolk, but Altus was resolute, confident his gift would please Ardea.",
								"However, he was neither as skilled or nimble as Reya, nor as clever or cunning as Gesme. His arrows would not scratch the moon, and despite his great strength, he could not move it. But Altus was stubborn, for many nights he tried and failed to bring down his quarry. The more he tried, the more frustrated he became. Altus even thought he could hear the moon's laughter reflected in the babbling brooks and rippling ponds, mocking his futile efforts. Still, Altus remained determined.",
								"Tyton, intrigued, observed Altus as he struggled. \"Why do you persist in this task, my child?\" the Amaranthine of night asked. \"You must know you will not succeed.\"",
								"Altus replied, \"If I did not try, then I would never know for certain if I could. But you may be right. For all my strength, I can never best the moon, and only a fool refuses to acknowledge when he has been bested.\" Altus paused, letting out a sigh. \"Pity, it would have made a lovely gift for Ardea.\"",
								"Tyton was touched, not just by the sentiment but by the incredible will of this birdfolk.",
								"\"Your resolve does you credit\" Tyton said. \"To capture the moon, you will require this.\" He said producing a lidded chalice, intricately carved from the wood of an alder tree. Tyton gave it to Altus, then the Amaranthine of night disappeared.",
								"Altus was puzzled, until the moon appeared from behind a cloud. He heard its laughter in the pond behind him. When he turned, he saw it: the moon's reflection set perfectly in the still, clear waters. Without delay, Altus filled the chalice with water. With the moon clearly reflected within the chalice, he quickly shut the lid. The moon was caught.",
								"As dawn began to break over the horizon, Tyton appeared once again before Altus, \"Let my sister gaze upon my creation, but return it by day's end. The night has need of it,\" old Father Owl said, before departing for the lands beyond life.",
								"And so it was that Altus presented Ardea with the moon. He became the first strig, and his people were gifted with his great strength and indomitable will. He kept his oath to Tyton, returning the moon that very evening. For this, Tyton gifted all strigs with the ability to see clearly under its light. Tyton welcomed Altus as a guest in his home, deep within the lands of death. Altus found the cold there bracing, and decided to share it with the people of Everden. This is why the weather is so inclement in winter; Altus returns each year, carrying storms of sleet and snow in his chalice, to test the birdfolk's endurance."

Most saw him as little more than a bumbler, someone who floated their way through life. In truth, Clhuran was full of mirth and cunning. \"Where I am,\" he oft remarked, \"is simply where I am meant to be. I follow the flow of the universe.\"",
								"For all his mirth, Clhuran was notoriously fickle; he was a trickster, who delighted in humbling birdfolk who boasted about their cleverness. This earned him many admirers, and just as many enemies.",
								"Clhuran never intended to compete in the gift-giving contest.",
								"\"What should I care what others think of me,\" he harrumphed, \"So long as I am happy?\" Some birdfolk, bitter at having been fooled by him, claimed Clhuran could never hope to win such a contest. Clhuran tried to pay them no heed, in his heart he felt the barbs hit their mark.",
								"\"Who am I kidding,\" Clhuran sighed. \"I am not strong, nor smart, nor skilled, nor leaderly... I couldn't possibly produce a gift worthy of Ardea.\" With this last thought he sank into a bitter melancholy.",
								"It was only when a young boy approached him that he regained his confidence. \"Please Clhuran, won't you show us what you can do?\" the small birdfolk said. \"Many of us love your tricks, and your jokes. You bring joy to all birdfolk! Surely if you try you can do it!\"",
								"Clhuran saw the sincerity in the boy's eyes, and suddenly he knew what to do. \"Fine, fine,\" he exclaimed in mock annoyance. \"I suppose I shall entertain you.\"",
								"With newfound confidence, he approached Ardea. All of the birdfolk were gathered, and when Clhuran looked upon the crowd he saw both enemies and friends. Thoughts of those friendships allowed Clhuran to reach deep within himself, and from the depths of his soul he felt a beat, like the Great Rhythm itself. Channeling this energy, Clhuran opened his beak and brought forth a most beautiful gift: a song.",
								"It was a song so perfect, so harmonious, that no birdfolk could deny its charm. Ardea beamed. \"My child, you have within you a rare gift. May all of your kin be blessed by it.\" With those words, Clhuran became the first luma, the Amaranthine of all fortune, good or ill. His peculiar connection to fate is shared by all his kin.",
								"Ever since Clhuran's performance all birds sing, hoping that they might imitate the perfect song he sang to Ardea. While some sing pleasantly, Clhuran made it so those who mocked him can only trill, shriek, or caw artlessly. This is why it is always important to show respect for others, no matter how odd they may seem."

This process was considered deeply respectful, as a tree could not be forced to take any shape it didn't agree to. So it was that specialist druids, known as shapers, became mediators between the will of the people and the will of the forest. Birdfolk shapers spoke to the tallest and most ancient tree in the Wood—Alderheart. The shapers obtained permission for birdfolk to build a home within Alderheart's branches. Later, the great tree again gave permission to shape its trunk into homes for an increasing population. This burgeoning city took the name of the tree who so generously provided a home for the people of the Wood, and Alderheart became Humblewood's capital. Known throughout the region as the \"Great Tree City,\" Alderheart, is a vibrant place and a cultural center, home to thousands of residents, some regional and some from the farthest corners of Everden.",

Effectively everyone in Humblewood is connected to Alderheart.",

The majority of the city's inhabitants are well-meaning, decent folk, but like any city there are dark alleys and back rooms.

								"As Alderheart is massive, it is often difficult for visitors to tell they are in a tree at all. The Great Tree City is divided into three main levels where people live, work, and go about their lives: the canopy, the trunk, and the roots.",
								"The canopy contains Alderheart's most iconic structures, including the chambers of the Birdfolk Council, the headquarters of the Perch Guard, and the largest market in the Wood. This market boasts boutiques where patrons can find high-quality weapons, armor, and adventuring gear, the latest fashions, finest foods, and goods brought in from all across Everden. Outside the main market, smaller shops peddle wares off the beaten path. Some contain enchanted goods at a bargain, though any Alderheart socialite will recommend sticking to the more respectable shops.",
								"City gates, located at strategic points around the canopy, are the only sanctioned ways to enter the city, and are moni-tored by Perch Guard watchposts. These gates are connected to lower levels of the tree and the forest floor by large winding stairways that allow travel by foot. Vast infrastructures for transportation are common in the canopy. \"Branchroads\", specially-shaped wooden pathways, are the arteries of trade in Alderheart. Along with rope bridges, these roads allow couriers to move goods from place to place using hand carts. Pulleys connected to raisable platforms are used to lift freight from the forest floor. In the outermost branches, where such infrastructure cannot be supported, gliding platforms provide birdfolk, at least, with a means of crossing otherwise impassable gaps. Without the ability to glide, navigating this part of the capital becomes increasingly dangerous.",
								"Buildings in the canopy are made from a variety of materials, including stone, wood, and brick. Most are stationed atop reinforced platforms to keep them stable. The more impres-sive homes are located in the Boughs District, just above the market. Those on the outer branches tend to be made of wood and have a more modest feel to them.",
								"The largest section of the metropolis, the trunk, which acts as an intermediary zone between the prosperous canopy and the less affluent roots. Many humblefolk make their homes here, where there is stable floor beneath them.",
								"The trunk can be one of the most confusing and disorienting areas of Alderheart for new travelers. Pathways split and diverge, sometimes tapering off into nothing. Systems of specially-designed cold lanterns serve as signposts along the main paths. These lanterns use either captured fireflies or motes of magic to provide light, depending on the neighborhood. In either case, lamplighters are tasked with making sure they stay lit during the day to provide a day/night cycle.",
								"In the trunk, another market thrives. Here, stalls of all kinds cluster around central support pillars shaped from Alderheart's wood. They showcase unique wares and niche humblefolk-style foods and cultural goods not found in canopy markets. There are also curiosity shops and sellers of regional wares, such as crystals harvested from the backs of young basilisks. Additionally, the trunk market is home to inns, taverns, and public houses. This is the best place in Alderheart to find serviceable goods and adventuring gear for those looking to save coin. Near the market is a druidic grove of moss and fungi supported by the Tenders, who help care for the tree and train new recruits to their order.",
								"Beyond the many shops and goods on offer in the trunk market, the central support pillars contain tenement style housing for the most cosmopolitan trunk dwellers. More affluent homes can also be found here, shaped out of the trunk, for Alderheart's traditionally minded humblefolk nobility, as well as birdfolk aristocrats whose homes have been here since Alderheart was first shaped.",
								"Down past the trunk market, pathways widen and wind, illuminated by knotholes in the tree that allow sunlight to filter inside. Although some homes in these bright hollows are built near the bark, where windows can be shaped out of the wood, most homes are shaped inside the dim pathways. A select few obtain permission to shape homes on the outside surface of the trunk. These special homes are connected to interior pathways via carefully fenced roads, and are considered a luxury that many cannot afford.",
								"The farther down the trunk one travels, the more shabby and ill-kept the residences and infrastructure become. There are no officially authorized ways to leave or enter the tree by way of lower parts of the trunk, and Perch Guard are constantly on the lookout for smugglers.",
								"Beneath the lowest parts of the trunk, a series of tunnels have been carved into the roots of Alderheart. At first, the roots were not considered to be official parts of the city, and their development was largely overlooked by city officials in the canopy, until word arrived of the illicit activities taking place there. Many were convinced that the tunneling would simply go away if druids were to heal the tree, but Alderheart itself took pity on those living here, and decided to allow the tunnels to exist rather than force people from their homes. The root tunnels have since been strengthened by druidic shaping, lit to be on par with the inside of the trunk, and a garrison of the Perch Guard was stationed nearby. Even with these improvements, the roots remain the poorest area in Alderheart: the slums of the Great Tree City. Here, the air is always dank and humid, and wild fungi grow rampant. The buildings are mostly cobbled together from scavenged materials, and some have been converted into community gathering places. These hubs help connect communities in the roots with helpful aid from the trunk district, and allow the people here to organize and plan neighborhood events. Life in the roots isn't easy, but people are trying their best to keep their communities strong, as they petition the canopy for better living conditions. There are few shops here, and they typically traffic in smuggled and stolen goods. Crime is ever-present; many who dwell in the roots see it as necessary to survive."
