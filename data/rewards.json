				"不断变化、欢快、美丽，原始的精灵可以承担他们喜欢的任何性别。当他们屈服于洛尔思的影响，选择固定他们的身体形态时，精灵们就失去了以这种方式转变的能力。然而，偶尔也会诞生一些雌雄同体的精灵，他们被宣布为科瑞隆的受祝福者，是神的爱和原始精灵的原始流动状态的活生生的象征。许多科里隆的首席祭司都带有这种祝福。",
				"其中最稀有的受祝福的精灵可以在完成长时间的休息后改变自己的性别--这是除乌鸦以外的各种精灵都在庆祝的奇迹。(黑暗精灵认为这种能力很可怕，并将其描述为一种诅咒，因为它可能会破坏他们整个社会的稳定。如果科瑞隆的祝福在一个乌鸦身上显现，这个精灵通常会逃到地表世界，在那些献给科瑞隆的人中间寻求庇护。"
